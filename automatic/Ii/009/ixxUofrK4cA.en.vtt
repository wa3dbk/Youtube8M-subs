00:01:13.570 --> 00:01:13.580 
important we'll see how quick the

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:15.430 
important we'll see how quick the
conditions<00:01:13.970> are<00:01:14.150> in<00:01:14.330> Melbourne<00:01:14.930> then<00:01:15.110> you

00:01:15.430 --> 00:01:15.440 
conditions are in Melbourne then you

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:16.930 
conditions are in Melbourne then you
know<00:01:15.590> if<00:01:15.770> you<00:01:16.220> have<00:01:16.340> to<00:01:16.490> maybe<00:01:16.640> change

00:01:16.930 --> 00:01:16.940 
know if you have to maybe change

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:20.219 
know if you have to maybe change
tensions<00:01:17.659> in<00:01:17.869> the<00:01:17.900> record<00:01:18.320> and<00:01:18.440> so<00:01:18.560> forth<00:01:18.830> but

00:01:20.219 --> 00:01:20.229 
tensions in the record and so forth but

00:01:20.229 --> 00:01:23.080 
tensions in the record and so forth but
yeah<00:01:21.229> the<00:01:21.409> focus<00:01:21.740> is<00:01:21.860> elsewhere<00:01:22.009> now<00:01:22.550> so<00:01:22.940> on

00:01:23.080 --> 00:01:23.090 
yeah the focus is elsewhere now so on

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:27.999 
yeah the focus is elsewhere now so on
the<00:01:23.180> record<00:01:25.810> necessarily<00:01:26.810> planning<00:01:27.440> men<00:01:27.830> to

00:01:27.999 --> 00:01:28.009 
the record necessarily planning men to

00:01:28.009 --> 00:01:30.370 
the record necessarily planning men to
arms<00:01:28.130> for<00:01:28.310> Jared<00:01:28.850> Jeremy<00:01:29.570> Chardy<00:01:29.750> coming<00:01:30.229> back

00:01:30.370 --> 00:01:30.380 
arms for Jared Jeremy Chardy coming back

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:32.080 
arms for Jared Jeremy Chardy coming back
in<00:01:30.500> their<00:01:30.619> second<00:01:31.009> set<00:01:31.220> and<00:01:31.250> testing<00:01:31.940> you<00:01:32.060> and

00:01:32.080 --> 00:01:32.090 
in their second set and testing you and

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:33.550 
in their second set and testing you and
taking<00:01:32.479> you<00:01:32.509> to<00:01:32.720> a<00:01:32.750> third<00:01:33.050> do<00:01:33.289> you<00:01:33.350> think

00:01:33.550 --> 00:01:33.560 
taking you to a third do you think

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:35.529 
taking you to a third do you think
that's<00:01:33.740> even<00:01:34.310> though<00:01:34.399> you<00:01:34.460> probably<00:01:35.119> want<00:01:35.509> to

00:01:35.529 --> 00:01:35.539 
that's even though you probably want to

00:01:35.539 --> 00:01:36.999 
that's even though you probably want to
be<00:01:35.660> on<00:01:35.780> the<00:01:35.899> overheat<00:01:36.320> do<00:01:36.590> you<00:01:36.680> think<00:01:36.860> that's

00:01:36.999 --> 00:01:37.009 
be on the overheat do you think that's

00:01:37.009 --> 00:01:38.350 
be on the overheat do you think that's
perhaps<00:01:37.160> a<00:01:37.369> good<00:01:37.550> test<00:01:37.789> for<00:01:37.880> you<00:01:38.000> heading<00:01:38.240> into

00:01:38.350 --> 00:01:38.360 
perhaps a good test for you heading into

00:01:38.360 --> 00:01:40.690 
perhaps a good test for you heading into
a<00:01:38.450> match<00:01:38.600> against<00:01:38.869> you<00:01:38.990> it<00:01:39.110> may<00:01:39.979> be<00:01:40.039> yeah<00:01:40.670> I

00:01:40.690 --> 00:01:40.700 
a match against you it may be yeah I

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:44.919 
a match against you it may be yeah I
mean<00:01:40.880> I<00:01:41.000> think<00:01:41.740> now<00:01:42.740> we're<00:01:43.729> both<00:01:43.880> totally<00:01:44.690> in

00:01:44.919 --> 00:01:44.929 
mean I think now we're both totally in

00:01:44.929 --> 00:01:46.690 
mean I think now we're both totally in
the<00:01:45.020> tournament<00:01:45.440> played<00:01:45.679> plenty<00:01:46.160> of<00:01:46.310> matches

00:01:46.690 --> 00:01:46.700 
the tournament played plenty of matches

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:49.120 
the tournament played plenty of matches
this<00:01:46.850> week<00:01:47.149> so<00:01:47.479> you<00:01:48.110> would<00:01:48.229> expect<00:01:48.560> both<00:01:48.800> of<00:01:48.860> us

00:01:49.120 --> 00:01:49.130 
this week so you would expect both of us

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:52.150 
this week so you would expect both of us
to<00:01:49.310> play<00:01:49.490> our<00:01:49.520> best<00:01:49.820> tennis<00:01:50.240> you<00:01:50.390> know<00:01:50.539> in<00:01:51.160> in

to play our best tennis you know in in
the<00:01:52.250> finals<00:01:52.670> and<00:01:54.280> maybe<00:01:55.280> it<00:01:55.399> was<00:01:55.580> good<00:01:55.759> to<00:01:55.910> have

00:01:56.020 --> 00:01:56.030 
the finals and maybe it was good to have

00:01:56.030 --> 00:02:00.640 
the finals and maybe it was good to have
a<00:01:56.060> test<00:01:56.330> you<00:01:56.539> know<00:01:57.909> get<00:01:58.909> a<00:01:58.939> good<00:01:59.150> thing<00:01:59.360> was<00:01:59.650> you

00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:00.650 
a test you know get a good thing was you

00:02:00.650 --> 00:02:02.140 
a test you know get a good thing was you
know<00:02:00.770> that<00:02:00.890> I<00:02:00.979> was<00:02:01.220> again<00:02:01.460> consistent<00:02:01.850> on<00:02:02.060> my

00:02:02.140 --> 00:02:02.150 
know that I was again consistent on my

love<00:03:17.060> on<00:03:17.270> a<00:03:17.330> break<00:03:17.510> i<00:03:17.540> think<00:03:17.900> serving<00:03:18.200> for<00:03:18.319> the

00:03:18.339 --> 00:03:18.349 
love on a break i think serving for the

00:03:18.349 --> 00:03:19.960

match ended up losing 6-1 in the fifth

00:03:19.970 --> 00:03:22.300 
match ended up losing 6-1 in the fifth
and<00:03:20.690> I<00:03:20.900> think<00:03:21.380> it's<00:03:21.470> after<00:03:21.800> that<00:03:21.950> I<00:03:22.069> went<00:03:22.190> on

and I think it's after that I went on

00:03:22.310 --> 00:03:25.210 
and I think it's after that I went on
the<00:03:22.760> run<00:03:22.910> I<00:03:22.970> think<00:03:23.120> it<00:03:23.390> really<00:03:23.769> proved<00:03:24.769> me<00:03:25.010> that

00:03:25.210 --> 00:03:25.220 
the run I think it really proved me that

00:03:25.220 --> 00:03:27.580 
the run I think it really proved me that
I<00:03:25.310> could<00:03:25.489> play<00:03:26.420> great<00:03:26.690> tennis<00:03:27.019> not<00:03:27.230> just<00:03:27.440> for<00:03:27.530> a

00:03:30.630 --> 00:03:30.640 
for three sets or maybe even longer

run<00:03:54.110> like<00:03:54.410> I<00:03:54.530> did<00:03:54.560> I<00:03:54.739> never<00:03:55.010> thought<00:03:55.250> that<00:03:55.430> was

00:03:55.570 --> 00:03:55.580 
run like I did I never thought that was

00:03:55.580 --> 00:03:57.640 
run like I did I never thought that was
going<00:03:55.670> to<00:03:55.730> happen<00:03:55.880> because<00:03:56.630> he<00:03:57.019> has<00:03:57.260> the<00:03:57.290> game

00:03:57.640 --> 00:03:57.650 
going to happen because he has the game

00:03:57.650 --> 00:04:00.940 
going to happen because he has the game
to<00:03:57.920> cause<00:03:58.099> me<00:03:58.310> a<00:03:58.340> lot<00:03:58.459> of<00:03:58.549> problems<00:03:58.940> and<00:03:59.500> I<00:04:00.500> just

00:04:00.940 --> 00:04:00.950 
to cause me a lot of problems and I just

00:04:00.950 --> 00:04:04.360 
to cause me a lot of problems and I just
think<00:04:01.160> the<00:04:02.030> confidence<00:04:02.510> I<00:04:02.630> had<00:04:02.840> and<00:04:03.370> the

00:04:04.360 --> 00:04:04.370 
think the confidence I had and the

00:04:04.370 --> 00:04:06.190 
think the confidence I had and the
amount<00:04:04.610> of<00:04:04.790> then<00:04:05.030> variation<00:04:05.720> I<00:04:05.810> could<00:04:06.019> bring

00:04:06.190 --> 00:04:06.200 
amount of then variation I could bring

00:04:06.200 --> 00:04:07.630 
amount of then variation I could bring
to<00:04:06.410> the<00:04:06.500> court<00:04:06.769> was<00:04:06.950> just<00:04:07.099> difficult<00:04:07.250> for

00:04:07.630 --> 00:04:07.640 
to the court was just difficult for

00:04:07.640 --> 00:04:11.770 
to the court was just difficult for
Layton<00:04:07.940> but<00:04:08.349> I<00:04:09.349> always<00:04:10.130> felt<00:04:10.489> like<00:04:10.760> it<00:04:10.970> was<00:04:11.120> not

00:04:11.770 --> 00:04:11.780

conditions drastically over over time
you<00:04:49.580> can<00:04:49.610> speed<00:04:49.940> up<00:04:49.970> the<00:04:50.150> balls<00:04:50.330> as<00:04:50.660> much<00:04:51.050> as

00:04:51.220 --> 00:04:51.230 
you can speed up the balls as much as

00:04:51.230 --> 00:04:54.820 
you can speed up the balls as much as
you<00:04:51.320> want<00:04:51.530> they're<00:04:51.980> going<00:04:52.130> to<00:04:52.220> be<00:04:52.340> so<00:04:53.500> fast<00:04:54.500> up

you want they're going to be so fast up
after<00:04:55.730> two<00:04:56.210> games<00:04:56.420> that<00:04:56.720> she's<00:04:57.500> going<00:04:57.650> to<00:04:57.710> be

00:04:57.760 --> 00:04:57.770 
after two games that she's going to be

00:04:57.770 --> 00:04:59.230 
after two games that she's going to be
hard<00:04:57.950> to<00:04:58.010> hit<00:04:58.190> winners<00:04:58.550> and<00:04:58.880> hard<00:04:59.030> to<00:04:59.150> hit

hard to hit winners and hard to hit

00:04:59.240 --> 00:05:01.660 
hard to hit winners and hard to hit
service<00:04:59.600> winners<00:04:59.900> and<00:05:00.170> that's<00:05:01.130> what<00:05:01.340> people

00:05:01.660 --> 00:05:01.670 
service winners and that's what people

00:05:01.670 --> 00:05:03.490

all<00:05:03.650> the<00:05:03.740> time<00:05:03.950> then<00:05:04.640> it's<00:05:05.240> good<00:05:05.420> to<00:05:05.510> have<00:05:05.570> a

00:05:05.650 --> 00:05:05.660 
all the time then it's good to have a

00:05:05.660 --> 00:05:07.930 
all the time then it's good to have a
slow<00:05:05.840> court<00:05:06.170> but<00:05:06.380> I<00:05:06.410> think<00:05:06.710> if<00:05:06.830> you<00:05:06.950> want<00:05:07.160> a<00:05:07.400> bit

00:05:07.930 --> 00:05:07.940 
slow court but I think if you want a bit

00:05:07.940 --> 00:05:10.210 
slow court but I think if you want a bit
more<00:05:07.970> even<00:05:08.630> ground<00:05:08.960> for<00:05:09.230> everybody<00:05:09.620> also<00:05:10.130> for

00:05:10.210 --> 00:05:10.220 
more even ground for everybody also for

00:05:10.220 --> 00:05:12.610 
more even ground for everybody also for
the<00:05:10.310> lower<00:05:10.430> rank<00:05:10.700> guys<00:05:10.940> and<00:05:11.360> more<00:05:12.080> danger<00:05:12.470> for

00:05:12.610 --> 00:05:12.620 
the lower rank guys and more danger for

00:05:12.620 --> 00:05:14.500 
the lower rank guys and more danger for
the<00:05:12.710> top<00:05:12.890> guys<00:05:13.130> then<00:05:13.550> you<00:05:13.700> go<00:05:13.820> with<00:05:14.000> the<00:05:14.090> faster

00:05:14.500 --> 00:05:14.510 
the top guys then you go with the faster

00:05:14.510 --> 00:05:16.900 
the top guys then you go with the faster
court<00:05:14.780> and<00:05:15.020> maybe<00:05:15.410> we'll<00:05:15.710> get<00:05:16.280> that<00:05:16.550> you<00:05:16.790> know

00:05:16.900 --> 00:05:16.910 
court and maybe we'll get that you know

00:05:16.910 --> 00:05:19.410 
court and maybe we'll get that you know

00:05:19.410 --> 00:05:19.420 
more so volley back into the game or

00:05:19.420 --> 00:05:21.640 
more so volley back into the game or
more<00:05:20.420> of<00:05:20.450> the<00:05:20.600> unknown<00:05:20.900> which<00:05:21.200> i<00:05:21.320> think<00:05:21.380> is

00:05:21.640 --> 00:05:21.650 
more of the unknown which i think is

00:05:21.650 --> 00:05:24.610 
more of the unknown which i think is
nice<00:05:21.890> and<00:05:22.690> I<00:05:23.690> think<00:05:24.290> it's<00:05:24.380> quite<00:05:24.470> incredible

00:05:24.610 --> 00:05:24.620 
nice and I think it's quite incredible

00:05:24.620 --> 00:05:26.410 
nice and I think it's quite incredible
how<00:05:25.070> everything<00:05:25.430> in<00:05:25.520> slow<00:05:25.640> down<00:05:25.970> over<00:05:26.300> the

00:05:26.410 --> 00:05:26.420 
how everything in slow down over the

00:05:26.420 --> 00:05:28.120 
how everything in slow down over the
years<00:05:26.660> I<00:05:26.900> remember<00:05:27.230> when<00:05:27.350> I<00:05:27.380> came<00:05:27.470> up<00:05:27.650> on<00:05:27.950> tour

00:05:28.120 --> 00:05:28.130 
years I remember when I came up on tour

00:05:28.130 --> 00:05:30.280 
years I remember when I came up on tour
was<00:05:28.310> late<00:05:28.520> and<00:05:28.760> things<00:05:28.970> were<00:05:29.090> so<00:05:29.270> different<00:05:29.300> we

00:05:30.280 --> 00:05:30.290 
was late and things were so different we

00:05:30.290 --> 00:05:31.900 
was late and things were so different we
had<00:05:30.410> to<00:05:30.590> actually<00:05:30.770> totally<00:05:31.130> change<00:05:31.490> our<00:05:31.670> games

00:05:31.900 --> 00:05:31.910 
had to actually totally change our games

00:05:31.910 --> 00:05:33.430 
had to actually totally change our games
around<00:05:32.210> to<00:05:32.570> actually<00:05:32.720> still<00:05:33.020> be<00:05:33.170> able<00:05:33.260> to

00:05:33.430 --> 00:05:33.440 
around to actually still be able to

00:05:33.440 --> 00:05:35.740 
around to actually still be able to
compete<00:05:33.740> today<00:05:34.090> so<00:05:35.090> I<00:05:35.120> think<00:05:35.420> it's<00:05:35.540> a<00:05:35.600> good

00:05:35.740 --> 00:05:35.750 
compete today so I think it's a good

00:05:35.750 --> 00:05:37.420 
compete today so I think it's a good
thing<00:05:35.960> I<00:05:36.230> don't<00:05:36.530> know<00:05:36.710> if<00:05:36.800> it's<00:05:36.920> as<00:05:37.040> quick<00:05:37.280> as

00:05:37.420 --> 00:05:37.430 
thing I don't know if it's as quick as

00:05:37.430 --> 00:05:39.490 
thing I don't know if it's as quick as
this<00:05:37.550> I<00:05:37.760> doubt<00:05:38.000> it<00:05:38.180> but<00:05:38.390> if<00:05:38.930> it<00:05:39.110> is<00:05:39.230> I<00:05:39.440> think

00:05:39.490 --> 00:05:39.500 
this I doubt it but if it is I think

00:05:39.500 --> 00:05:40.630 
this I doubt it but if it is I think
