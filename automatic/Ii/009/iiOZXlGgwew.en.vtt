00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.740
 I want to learn maths sign up 

00:00:02.010 --> 00:00:07.230
 Come with me, have you ever stopped to think of 

00:00:04.740 --> 00:00:09.389
 where the measures of the roles that 

00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:11.700
 we use in our day to day 

00:00:09.389 --> 00:00:12.540
 the most common paper format used 

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:14.250
 around 

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:18.090
 it is this type of paper here that is the paper 

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:20.039
 a4 but we also have the role a3 that is 

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:21.330
 here is a drawing made by 

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:23.460
 me 

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:25.830
 we also have the paper at 5 which is the size 

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:30.000
 this block here and also others 

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:31.260
 such as 0 to 1 to 2 to 3 to 4 to 5 and 

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:34.290
 so on 

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:36.600
 this type of paper in series a is paper 

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:38.340
 most used worldwide it is only 

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:41.790
 used for example in countries such as 

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:43.649
 United States, I always count on the 

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:45.570
 united states they use another type 

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:48.329
 paper of other proportions which the 

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:51.449
 paper was a lot of people think paper 

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:54.629
 a4 this format here because it 

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:56.910
 would look like a golden rectangle when 

00:00:54.629 --> 00:00:58.980
 not the paper buddy a4 is not a 

00:00:56.910 --> 00:01:00.030
 rectangle of gold it is a rectangle of 

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:03.300
 silver 

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:05.100
 that same silver rectangle that is a 

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:07.590
 rectangle that has other proportions 

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:08.760
 when you divide your biggest side by 

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:10.890
 its minor side 

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:13.290
 it gives a number that is approximately the 

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:16.320
 value of the square root of two go 

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:19.530
 take the paper example a4 the larger side 

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:22.259
 of the paper average a4 297 mm 

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:24.180
 while the smaller side of the middle A4 paper 

00:01:22.259 --> 00:01:30.299
 210 millimeters 

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:32.759
 dividing 297 by 210 we found 1.4142 

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:35.490
 pontinho bridge a dot ends up generating 

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:37.610
 a periodic tithe obviously the root 

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:39.689
 square of 2 is an irrational number 

00:01:37.610 --> 00:01:42.150
 therefore does not form a periodic tithe 

00:01:39.689 --> 00:01:44.369
 the result of this account is only one 

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:45.659
 approximation to the square root of 2 

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:48.090
 that is enough 

00:01:45.659 --> 00:01:50.790
 here comes a question but why use a 

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:53.310
 rectangle with these proportions of 

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:55.110
 square root of 2 hours 

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:57.570
 the silver rectangle has the 

00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:59.640
 following property when you divide 

00:01:57.570 --> 00:02:04.079
 this rectangle here is the middle by the side 

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:08.399
 largest of them the two rectangles that are 

00:02:04.079 --> 00:02:11.489
 generated are proportional to the rectangle 

00:02:08.399 --> 00:02:12.830
 greater and generates a new measurement on 

00:02:11.489 --> 00:02:15.260
 for example 

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:17.090
 divided in half generates two sheets of 

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:19.100
 paper to 5 

00:02:17.090 --> 00:02:21.020
 follow here the paper size at 5 

00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:25.630
 with paper a4 the paper so with 

00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:25.630
 exactly half the area of A4 paper 

00:02:25.850 --> 00:02:32.120
 when we overlap each other 

00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:33.440
 You will understand exactly this. 

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:36.520
 feature 

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:39.320
 now comparing a3 paper with a4 paper 

00:02:36.520 --> 00:02:42.320
 exactly the same thing happens 

00:02:39.320 --> 00:02:46.910
 look at the paper a3 

00:02:42.320 --> 00:02:49.610
 to exactly double the paper size 

00:02:46.910 --> 00:02:53.390
 a4 two roles to 4 

00:02:49.610 --> 00:02:54.950
 generate a role a3 observe this scheme 

00:02:53.390 --> 00:02:58.070
 which is now appearing in your video 

00:02:54.950 --> 00:03:00.980
 he says the measures of some of these 

00:02:58.070 --> 00:03:02.870
 papers from 0 to 0 and reaching 1 

00:03:00.980 --> 00:03:06.020
 2a 3a 4a 5 a 6 

00:03:02.870 --> 00:03:08.660
 etc. This proportion of the square root of 

00:03:06.020 --> 00:03:10.760
 two very important since when you 

00:03:08.660 --> 00:03:13.820
 will increase or reduce 

00:03:10.760 --> 00:03:16.040
 size paper is not lost since the 

00:03:13.820 --> 00:03:19.310
 proportions remain the same 

00:03:16.040 --> 00:03:21.560
 the paper at 0 is the original paper and it is 

00:03:19.310 --> 00:03:24.709
 built in such a way that your area 

00:03:21.560 --> 00:03:27.980
 be one square meter and the measures 

00:03:24.709 --> 00:03:29.780
 rounded paper to 0 are one thousand cent 

00:03:27.980 --> 00:03:34.220
 and eighty-nine millimeters in height 

00:03:29.780 --> 00:03:36.410
 by 841 millimeters wide 

00:03:34.220 --> 00:03:38.269
 the value of the ratio between the larger side 

00:03:36.410 --> 00:03:41.000
 the smaller one generates a number approximately 

00:03:38.269 --> 00:03:42.980
 equal to the square root of 2 and from 

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:45.620
 paper at 0 when we started to fold 

00:03:42.980 --> 00:03:47.330
 the middle we get the paper to 1 

00:03:45.620 --> 00:03:49.190
 and there dividing the paper there is a medium 

00:03:47.330 --> 00:03:51.440
 we get the paper 2 

00:03:49.190 --> 00:03:54.530
 the paper to 2 divided in half we get the 

00:03:51.440 --> 00:03:56.690
 paper a3 and so on 

00:03:54.530 --> 00:03:57.980
 all of them respecting the same 

00:03:56.690 --> 00:04:00.890
 proportions 

00:03:57.980 --> 00:04:03.440
 we will now prove this fact the role 

00:04:00.890 --> 00:04:05.180
 a4 means the paper at 0 has undergone 

00:04:03.440 --> 00:04:07.580
 four folds 

00:04:05.180 --> 00:04:09.709
 when we split the paper a4 in half 

00:04:07.580 --> 00:04:12.890
 that way we get two 

00:04:09.709 --> 00:04:13.760
 papers to 5, or when we divide the paper 

00:04:12.890 --> 00:04:16.190
 to 0 

00:04:13.760 --> 00:04:18.979
 consecutively to the middle four times 

00:04:16.190 --> 00:04:21.320
 we'll have two high four numbers 

00:04:18.979 --> 00:04:24.020
 of sheet of paper a4 this means that 

00:04:21.320 --> 00:04:24.940
 we will have 16 sheets to make the paper 

00:04:24.020 --> 00:04:28.360
 to 0 

00:04:24.940 --> 00:04:30.130
 a4 strip of paper we need 16 

00:04:28.360 --> 00:04:31.780
 sheets of paper a4 

00:04:30.130 --> 00:04:34.270
 Let's experiment and make a 

00:04:31.780 --> 00:04:36.370
 paper at 0 here on the floor 

00:04:34.270 --> 00:04:37.870
 notice just what I'll do here I 

00:04:36.370 --> 00:04:39.130
 mount a rectangle with the size of the 

00:04:37.870 --> 00:04:41.980
 paper at 0 

00:04:39.130 --> 00:04:45.420
 only with papers of size a4 with 16 

00:04:41.980 --> 00:04:45.420
 roles to 4 

00:04:57.660 --> 00:05:06.520
 They will also only be started so fast 

00:05:04.300 --> 00:05:07.750
 cleared of 200 of the 

00:05:06.520 --> 00:05:11.380
 proportions 

00:05:07.750 --> 00:05:14.410
 this one would be the paper at 0 

00:05:11.380 --> 00:05:17.110
 It has one square meter of area and you 

00:05:14.410 --> 00:05:18.160
 realizes that with only 16 

00:05:17.110 --> 00:05:21.850
 A4 paper format 

00:05:18.160 --> 00:05:24.250
 we can then produce the paper at 0 

00:05:21.850 --> 00:05:26.740
 If you liked the video of a jewel that 

00:05:24.250 --> 00:05:29.290
 I liked it and signed up for the math channel 

00:05:26.740 --> 00:05:33.510
 clean stay connected in the news one 

00:05:29.290 --> 00:05:33.510
 big hug and see you next videos
