00:03:53.940 --> 00:03:53.950 
was our entire oxygen supply we're in

00:03:53.950 --> 00:03:54.479 
was our entire oxygen supply we're in
big<00:03:54.130> trouble

00:03:54.479 --> 00:03:54.489 
big trouble

00:03:54.489 --> 00:03:56.970

have<00:03:57.100> a<00:03:57.130> look<00:03:57.370> at<00:03:57.489> this

00:03:57.840 --> 00:03:57.850 
have a look at this

00:03:57.850 --> 00:03:59.580 
have a look at this
I<00:03:57.880> think<00:03:58.540> these<00:03:58.660> regulators<00:03:59.170> have<00:03:59.470> been

00:03:59.580 --> 00:03:59.590 
I think these regulators have been

00:03:59.590 --> 00:04:02.430 
I think these regulators have been
tampered<00:03:59.800> with<00:04:00.010> um<00:04:00.690> captain<00:04:01.690> someone

00:04:02.430 --> 00:04:02.440 
tampered with um captain someone

00:04:02.440 --> 00:04:05.460 
tampered with um captain someone
loosened<00:04:03.100> these<00:04:03.220> fittings<00:04:03.700> hey<00:04:04.230> cap

00:04:05.460 --> 00:04:05.470 
loosened these fittings hey cap
