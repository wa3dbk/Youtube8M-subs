00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:20.340 
some things to get here we first started

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:22.850 
some things to get here we first started
with<00:01:20.520> skins<00:01:20.850> and<00:01:21.630> we<00:01:21.869> use<00:01:22.049> that<00:01:22.229> data<00:01:22.500> to<00:01:22.619> get

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:22.860 
with skins and we use that data to get

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:24.710 
with skins and we use that data to get
make<00:01:23.220> sure<00:01:23.400> the<00:01:23.490> proportions<00:01:23.640> are<00:01:24.150> right<00:01:24.360> that

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:24.720 
make sure the proportions are right that

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:26.649 
make sure the proportions are right that
whole<00:01:25.049> logic<00:01:25.290> was<00:01:25.590> right<00:01:25.799> now

00:01:26.649 --> 00:01:26.659 
whole logic was right now

00:01:26.659 --> 00:01:29.109 
whole logic was right now
and<00:01:26.750> then<00:01:27.500> we<00:01:27.649> added<00:01:27.860> our<00:01:28.130> artistic<00:01:28.850> touch<00:01:29.090> to

00:01:29.109 --> 00:01:29.119 
and then we added our artistic touch to

00:01:29.119 --> 00:01:31.240 
and then we added our artistic touch to
it<00:01:29.450> and<00:01:29.630> we<00:01:29.810> added<00:01:29.930> a<00:01:30.170> whole<00:01:30.409> lot<00:01:30.680> of<00:01:30.710> details

00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:31.250 
it and we added a whole lot of details

00:01:31.250 --> 00:01:33.130 
it and we added a whole lot of details
too<00:01:31.549> so<00:01:31.820> we<00:01:32.030> can<00:01:32.180> actually<00:01:32.299> look<00:01:32.600> at<00:01:32.750> her<00:01:32.840> skin

00:01:33.130 --> 00:01:33.140

actually<00:01:54.079> capture<00:01:54.500> the<00:01:55.399> nuances<00:01:56.119> of<00:01:56.360> facial

00:01:56.919 --> 00:01:56.929 
actually capture the nuances of facial

00:01:56.929 --> 00:01:59.350

00:02:01.059 --> 00:02:01.069 
and it is so much better than the bone

00:02:01.069 --> 00:02:02.980 
and it is so much better than the bone
driven<00:02:01.490> system<00:02:01.849> that<00:02:02.030> we<00:02:02.270> used<00:02:02.509> in<00:02:02.659> the<00:02:02.720> past

00:02:02.980 --> 00:02:02.990 
driven system that we used in the past

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:06.370 
driven system that we used in the past
and<00:02:03.349> this<00:02:04.009> all<00:02:04.310> adds<00:02:04.610> to<00:02:04.880> the<00:02:05.060> realism<00:02:05.479> of<00:02:05.959> her
