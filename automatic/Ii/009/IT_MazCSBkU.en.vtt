00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:48.850 
again to number two it's a pretty boring
glitch<00:01:46.400> but<00:01:46.730> you<00:01:47.030> know<00:01:47.180> what<00:01:47.360> it<00:01:47.540> gets<00:01:47.800> it<00:01:48.800> gets

glitch but you know what it gets it gets

00:01:48.860 --> 00:01:52.960 
glitch but you know what it gets it gets
you<00:01:49.190> to<00:01:49.370> a<00:01:49.400> bunch<00:01:49.700> of<00:01:50.050> ice<00:01:51.050> cores<00:01:51.700> if<00:01:52.700> that's

00:01:52.960 --> 00:01:52.970 
you to a bunch of ice cores if that's

00:01:52.970 --> 00:01:57.430 
you to a bunch of ice cores if that's
what<00:01:53.120> you're<00:01:53.240> looking<00:01:53.300> at<00:01:56.230> sometimes<00:01:57.230> it<00:01:57.350> goes

00:01:57.430 --> 00:01:57.440 
what you're looking at sometimes it goes

00:01:57.440 --> 00:01:59.830 
what you're looking at sometimes it goes
back<00:01:57.680> to<00:01:57.890> 19<00:01:58.460> meters<00:01:58.850> and<00:01:59.120> then<00:01:59.570> it<00:01:59.690> goes<00:01:59.810> back

00:01:59.830 --> 00:01:59.840 
back to 19 meters and then it goes back

00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:02.500 
back to 19 meters and then it goes back
down<00:02:00.170> to<00:02:00.440> 17<00:02:00.920> in<00:02:01.190> back<00:02:01.460> and<00:02:01.610> forth<00:02:01.850> and<00:02:02.060> that

00:02:02.500 --> 00:02:02.510 
down to 17 in back and forth and that

00:02:02.510 --> 00:02:05.770 
down to 17 in back and forth and that
will<00:02:02.600> change<00:02:02.900> the<00:02:03.700> jumps<00:02:04.700> either<00:02:05.090> backwards

00:02:05.770 --> 00:02:05.780 
will change the jumps either backwards

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:08.800 
will change the jumps either backwards
but<00:02:06.320> it<00:02:06.440> will<00:02:06.560> not<00:02:06.710> go<00:02:06.890> up<00:02:07.460> to<00:02:08.060> jump<00:02:08.479> number

00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:08.810 
but it will not go up to jump number

00:02:08.810 --> 00:02:17.199 
but it will not go up to jump number
three<00:02:09.729> show<00:02:10.729> you<00:02:10.900> here<00:02:14.920> okay<00:02:15.970> it's<00:02:16.970> pretty

00:03:26.390 --> 00:03:29.520 
on number three now but the easiest ways
to<00:03:26.420> start<00:03:27.110> going<00:03:27.290> number<00:03:27.500> two<00:03:27.590> because<00:03:28.490> it's

00:03:29.520 --> 00:03:29.530 
to start going number two because it's

00:03:29.530 --> 00:03:33.000 
to start going number two because it's
not<00:03:30.530> that<00:03:30.590> high<00:03:30.890> I<00:03:31.070> guess<00:03:31.310> that's<00:03:32.000> about<00:03:32.240> it

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:33.010 
not that high I guess that's about it

00:03:33.010 --> 00:03:36.370 
not that high I guess that's about it
hopefully<00:03:34.010> you<00:03:34.070> guys<00:03:34.190> like
