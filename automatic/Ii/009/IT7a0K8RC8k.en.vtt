to<00:00:28.470> inflation<00:00:29.070> and<00:00:29.189> that's<00:00:29.340> exactly<00:00:29.550> what<00:00:30.029> we

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:30.150 
to inflation and that's exactly what we

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:32.479 
to inflation and that's exactly what we
see<00:00:30.390> and<00:00:30.570> this<00:00:31.019> inflation<00:00:31.500> it's<00:00:31.949> not<00:00:32.130> because

see and this inflation it's not because

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:34.400 
see and this inflation it's not because

the<00:00:55.530> economy<00:00:55.590> by<00:00:55.949> running<00:00:56.309> huge<00:00:56.520> deficits<00:00:57.120> and

00:00:57.290 --> 00:00:57.300 
the economy by running huge deficits and

00:00:57.300 --> 00:00:58.939 
the economy by running huge deficits and
the<00:00:57.360> Fed<00:00:57.840> prints<00:00:58.170> money<00:00:58.379> to<00:00:58.559> buy<00:00:58.770> up

the Fed prints money to buy up

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:01.010 
the Fed prints money to buy up
Treasuries<00:00:59.520> that<00:01:00.000> expands<00:01:00.570> the<00:01:00.660> money<00:01:00.809> supply

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:01.020 
Treasuries that expands the money supply

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:03.650 
Treasuries that expands the money supply
that<00:01:01.680> diminishes<00:01:02.100> the<00:01:02.309> value<00:01:02.340> of<00:01:02.760> money<00:01:02.969> that

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:03.660 
that diminishes the value of money that

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:05.390 
that diminishes the value of money that
means<00:01:03.840> prices<00:01:04.409> have<00:01:04.559> to<00:01:04.739> rise<00:01:04.920> and<00:01:05.250> that's

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:05.400 
means prices have to rise and that's

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:06.740 
means prices have to rise and that's
exactly<00:01:05.580> what's<00:01:06.090> happened<00:01:06.420> right<00:01:06.540> so<00:01:06.659> the

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:06.750 
exactly what's happened right so the

exactly what's happened right so the
other<00:01:06.930> thing<00:01:07.049> that<00:01:07.260> some<00:01:07.890> people<00:01:08.189> would<00:01:08.310> say

00:01:08.359 --> 00:01:08.369 
other thing that some people would say

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:10.700 
other thing that some people would say
is<00:01:08.820> causing<00:01:09.299> this<00:01:09.360> inflation<00:01:09.720> is<00:01:09.990> faster

the fourth quarter is there a link

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:19.160 
the fourth quarter is there a link
between<00:01:17.600> economic<00:01:18.600> growth<00:01:18.780> and<00:01:18.990> inflation

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:19.170 
between economic growth and inflation

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:21.560 
between economic growth and inflation
yeah<00:01:19.920> but<00:01:20.159> it's<00:01:20.280> the<00:01:20.430> opposite<00:01:20.909> the<00:01:21.360> more

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:21.570 
yeah but it's the opposite the more

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:23.539 
yeah but it's the opposite the more
economic<00:01:22.049> growth<00:01:22.229> you<00:01:22.409> have<00:01:22.619> the<00:01:23.369> less

00:01:23.539 --> 00:01:23.549 
economic growth you have the less

00:01:23.549 --> 00:01:24.980 
economic growth you have the less
inflation<00:01:24.240> at<00:01:24.330> least<00:01:24.509> if<00:01:24.659> you're<00:01:24.750> measuring

00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:24.990 
inflation at least if you're measuring

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:27.260 
inflation at least if you're measuring
it<00:01:25.320> by<00:01:25.470> prices<00:01:25.979> because<00:01:26.490> when<00:01:26.700> economies<00:01:27.000> are

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:27.270 
it by prices because when economies are

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:29.569 
it by prices because when economies are
growing<00:01:27.420> they're<00:01:28.380> growing<00:01:28.799> their<00:01:28.829> production

00:01:29.569 --> 00:01:29.579 
growing they're growing their production

00:01:29.579 --> 00:01:31.760 
growing they're growing their production
they're<00:01:29.970> producing<00:01:30.509> more<00:01:30.689> goods<00:01:31.049> and<00:01:31.290> that

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:31.770 
they're producing more goods and that

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:34.039 
they're producing more goods and that
puts<00:01:32.040> downward<00:01:32.400> pressure<00:01:32.939> on<00:01:33.090> prices<00:01:33.210> it's

00:01:34.039 --> 00:01:34.049 
puts downward pressure on prices it's

00:01:34.049 --> 00:01:35.929 
puts downward pressure on prices it's
when<00:01:34.259> you<00:01:34.380> have<00:01:34.560> economy<00:01:35.189> stagnated<00:01:35.909> or

when you have economy stagnated or

contracting when they're producing fewer
goods<00:01:38.369> that<00:01:38.880> you<00:01:38.970> have<00:01:39.119> upward<00:01:39.509> pressure<00:01:39.750> on

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:39.900 
goods that you have upward pressure on

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:41.810 
goods that you have upward pressure on
prices<00:01:40.020> know<00:01:40.829> the<00:01:41.009> real<00:01:41.220> reason<00:01:41.610> you<00:01:41.700> have

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:41.820 
prices know the real reason you have

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:43.670 
prices know the real reason you have
inflation<00:01:42.240> is<00:01:42.570> because<00:01:43.079> the<00:01:43.229> government's

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:43.680 
inflation is because the government's

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:46.010 
inflation is because the government's
are<00:01:43.829> inflating<00:01:44.460> inflation<00:01:45.299> literally<00:01:45.780> means

rise<00:03:25.440> which<00:03:25.799> I<00:03:25.949> believe<00:03:26.250> will<00:03:26.430> happen<00:03:26.669> and

00:03:27.110 --> 00:03:27.120 
rise which I believe will happen and

00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:29.179 
rise which I believe will happen and
when<00:03:27.510> that<00:03:27.540> happens<00:03:27.659> China<00:03:28.560> will<00:03:28.799> start<00:03:29.040> to

00:03:29.179 --> 00:03:29.189 
when that happens China will start to

00:03:29.189 --> 00:03:31.819 
when that happens China will start to
rein<00:03:29.430> in<00:03:29.609> inflation<00:03:30.209> but<00:03:30.599> it<00:03:30.750> will<00:03:30.870> unleash<00:03:31.349> an

00:03:31.819 --> 00:03:31.829 
rein in inflation but it will unleash an

00:03:31.829 --> 00:03:33.679 
rein in inflation but it will unleash an
inflationary<00:03:32.459> nightmare<00:03:33.030> here<00:03:33.510> in<00:03:33.599> the

00:03:33.679 --> 00:03:33.689 
inflationary nightmare here in the

00:03:33.689 --> 00:03:35.089 
inflationary nightmare here in the
United<00:03:34.049> States<00:03:34.260> you're<00:03:34.769> going<00:03:34.889> to<00:03:34.949> see

00:03:35.089 --> 00:03:35.099 
United States you're going to see

00:03:35.099 --> 00:03:37.580 
United States you're going to see
consumer<00:03:35.579> prices<00:03:35.879> and<00:03:36.299> interest<00:03:37.109> rates

00:03:37.580 --> 00:03:37.590 
consumer prices and interest rates

00:03:37.590 --> 00:03:39.890 
consumer prices and interest rates
skyrocketing<00:03:38.489> because<00:03:38.970> when<00:03:39.180> we're<00:03:39.419> unable

00:03:39.890 --> 00:03:39.900 
skyrocketing because when we're unable

00:03:39.900 --> 00:03:43.009 
skyrocketing because when we're unable
to<00:03:40.169> export<00:03:40.979> our<00:03:41.040> inflation<00:03:41.459> to<00:03:42.120> China<00:03:42.479> we're

00:03:43.009 --> 00:03:43.019 
to export our inflation to China we're

00:03:43.019 --> 00:03:44.179 
to export our inflation to China we're
going<00:03:43.109> to<00:03:43.229> have<00:03:43.319> to<00:03:43.439> literally<00:03:43.709> eat<00:03:44.040> it

00:03:44.179 --> 00:03:44.189 
going to have to literally eat it

00:03:44.189 --> 00:03:46.129 
going to have to literally eat it
ourselves<00:03:44.400> and<00:03:45.060> that's<00:03:45.509> when<00:03:45.780> the<00:03:45.900> Fed<00:03:46.109> is

00:03:46.129 --> 00:03:46.139 
ourselves and that's when the Fed is

00:03:46.139 --> 00:03:48.199 
ourselves and that's when the Fed is
going<00:03:46.439> to<00:03:46.500> be<00:03:46.620> in<00:03:47.220> between<00:03:47.430> a<00:03:47.669> rock<00:03:47.939> and<00:03:48.120> a<00:03:48.180> hard

00:03:48.199 --> 00:03:48.209 
going to be in between a rock and a hard

00:03:48.209 --> 00:03:50.449 
going to be in between a rock and a hard
place<00:03:48.449> so<00:03:48.900> that's<00:03:49.049> a<00:03:49.109> pretty<00:03:49.290> grim<00:03:49.590> scenario

00:03:50.449 --> 00:03:50.459

as possible because China now realizes

00:04:16.799 --> 00:04:18.649 
as possible because China now realizes
that<00:04:16.970> inflation<00:04:17.970> is<00:04:18.150> the<00:04:18.479> political

00:04:18.649 --> 00:04:18.659 
that inflation is the political

they're trying to achieve they've been

they're trying to achieve they've been
afraid<00:04:32.220> of<00:04:32.360> rocking<00:04:33.360> the<00:04:33.449> boat<00:04:33.660> and<00:04:33.930> now<00:04:34.440> they

00:04:34.640 --> 00:04:34.650 
afraid of rocking the boat and now they

00:04:34.650 --> 00:04:37.040 
afraid of rocking the boat and now they
realize<00:04:35.039> that<00:04:35.370> the<00:04:35.639> cost<00:04:35.940> of<00:04:36.270> propping<00:04:36.870> up<00:04:36.990> the

00:04:37.040 --> 00:04:37.050 
realize that the cost of propping up the

00:04:37.050 --> 00:04:39.550 
realize that the cost of propping up the
US<00:04:37.440> dollar<00:04:37.710> in<00:04:37.830> the<00:04:37.919> US<00:04:38.069> economy<00:04:38.580> is<00:04:38.699> is

00:04:39.550 --> 00:04:39.560 
US dollar in the US economy is is

00:04:39.560 --> 00:04:42.350 
US dollar in the US economy is is
greater<00:04:40.560> than<00:04:40.979> the<00:04:41.039> cost<00:04:41.280> of<00:04:41.580> allowing<00:04:42.060> it<00:04:42.210> to

00:04:42.350 --> 00:04:42.360 
greater than the cost of allowing it to

00:04:42.360 --> 00:04:44.390 
greater than the cost of allowing it to
collapse<00:04:42.990> so<00:04:43.319> I<00:04:43.349> think<00:04:43.530> they're<00:04:44.069> going<00:04:44.190> to<00:04:44.280> be

00:04:44.390 --> 00:04:44.400 
collapse so I think they're going to be

00:04:44.400 --> 00:04:46.370 
collapse so I think they're going to be
moving<00:04:44.610> quicker<00:04:45.389> and<00:04:45.720> you<00:04:45.990> know<00:04:46.080> when<00:04:46.259> you

00:04:46.370 --> 00:04:46.380 
moving quicker and you know when you

00:04:46.380 --> 00:04:48.860 
moving quicker and you know when you
President<00:04:47.099> Obama<00:04:47.340> had<00:04:47.610> his<00:04:47.759> press<00:04:48.270> confidence

President Obama had his press confidence

with president who and he actually did a

00:04:52.530 --> 00:04:54.409 
with president who and he actually did a
pretty<00:04:52.740> good<00:04:52.949> job<00:04:53.009> of<00:04:53.250> explaining<00:04:53.789> to<00:04:54.120> China

00:04:54.409 --> 00:04:54.419 
pretty good job of explaining to China

00:04:54.419 --> 00:04:56.689 
pretty good job of explaining to China
why<00:04:55.139> the<00:04:55.199> Chinese<00:04:55.590> would<00:04:55.919> benefit<00:04:56.400> from<00:04:56.460> a

00:04:56.689 --> 00:04:56.699 
why the Chinese would benefit from a

00:04:56.699 --> 00:04:58.580 
why the Chinese would benefit from a
stronger<00:04:57.030> arm<00:04:57.210> be<00:04:57.449> that<00:04:57.930> it<00:04:58.020> would<00:04:58.050> bring<00:04:58.319> down

00:04:58.580 --> 00:04:58.590 
stronger arm be that it would bring down

00:04:58.590 --> 00:05:00.379 
stronger arm be that it would bring down
their<00:04:58.800> prices<00:04:59.340> that<00:04:59.729> it<00:04:59.820> would<00:04:59.910> cause<00:05:00.150> the

but<00:05:05.039> what<00:05:05.190> he<00:05:05.250> forgets<00:05:05.610> to<00:05:05.699> point<00:05:06.030> out<00:05:06.210> is<00:05:06.360> it's

00:05:06.860 --> 00:05:06.870 
but what he forgets to point out is it's

00:05:06.870 --> 00:05:08.719 
but what he forgets to point out is it's
the<00:05:07.020> exact<00:05:07.320> opposite<00:05:07.830> here<00:05:08.160> because<00:05:08.520> as<00:05:08.699> the

00:05:08.719 --> 00:05:08.729 
the exact opposite here because as the

00:05:08.729 --> 00:05:10.670 
the exact opposite here because as the
Chinese<00:05:09.240> currency<00:05:09.449> increases<00:05:10.349> in<00:05:10.500> strength

00:05:10.670 --> 00:05:10.680 
Chinese currency increases in strength

00:05:10.680 --> 00:05:13.370 
Chinese currency increases in strength
the<00:05:11.220> dollar<00:05:11.490> must<00:05:12.120> decrease<00:05:12.539> and<00:05:12.900> so

00:05:13.370 --> 00:05:13.380 
the dollar must decrease and so

00:05:13.380 --> 00:05:15.740 
the dollar must decrease and so
Americans<00:05:14.190> experience<00:05:14.759> higher<00:05:15.060> prices

00:05:15.740 --> 00:05:15.750 
Americans experience higher prices

00:05:15.750 --> 00:05:18.020 
Americans experience higher prices
falling<00:05:16.440> purchasing<00:05:17.070> power<00:05:17.220> and<00:05:17.520> a<00:05:17.759> lower

00:05:18.020 --> 00:05:18.030 
falling purchasing power and a lower

00:05:18.030 --> 00:05:19.939 
falling purchasing power and a lower
standard<00:05:18.180> of<00:05:18.659> living<00:05:18.810> and<00:05:19.080> that<00:05:19.560> is<00:05:19.740> what's

00:05:19.939 --> 00:05:19.949 
standard of living and that is what's

00:05:19.949 --> 00:05:22.940 
standard of living and that is what's
coming<00:05:20.310> unfortunately
