00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:51.469 
it will rest on but you know obviously
the<00:01:49.619> best<00:01:49.799> way<00:01:50.009> to<00:01:50.070> do<00:01:50.280> it<00:01:50.430> is<00:01:50.579> to<00:01:50.610> stick<00:01:51.180> it<00:01:51.329> on

00:01:51.469 --> 00:01:51.479 
the best way to do it is to stick it on

the best way to do it is to stick it on
here<00:01:51.840> and<00:01:52.049> it<00:01:52.470> does<00:01:52.649> a<00:01:52.680> set<00:01:53.220> come<00:01:53.490> off<00:01:53.670> quite

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:53.970 
here and it does a set come off quite

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:56.149 
here and it does a set come off quite
easily<00:01:54.000> you<00:01:54.479> simply<00:01:54.869> just<00:01:54.899> twist<00:01:55.680> to<00:01:55.890> make<00:01:55.920> it

00:01:56.149 --> 00:01:56.159 
easily you simply just twist to make it

00:01:56.159 --> 00:01:57.800 
easily you simply just twist to make it
come<00:01:56.340> off<00:01:56.369> and<00:01:56.670> it<00:01:57.060> doesn't<00:01:57.390> leave<00:01:57.540> any

00:01:57.800 --> 00:01:57.810 
come off and it doesn't leave any
