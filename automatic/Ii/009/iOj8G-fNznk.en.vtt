00:00:00.290 --> 00:00:05.330
 for girls, it's me again at the level of 

00:00:02.870 --> 00:00:08.420
 family city today I decided 

00:00:05.330 --> 00:00:10.160
 record a video of clothes because 

00:00:08.420 --> 00:00:12.830
 several of you asked me to 

00:00:10.160 --> 00:00:14.599
 did as a video hall of clothes like that 

00:00:12.830 --> 00:00:16.640
 I told them that roquitas I bought 

00:00:14.599 --> 00:00:20.320
 I'm almost not buying many years 

00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:23.240
 I like makeup more, but this month 

00:00:20.320 --> 00:00:25.040
 I decided to buy three dresses and they are the 

00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:25.700
 I 'm going to show you the day of 

00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:27.530
 today 

00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:31.460
 ok then there is the first little dress that 

00:00:27.530 --> 00:00:33.080
 you are and buy the fabric I loved from 

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:35.600
 this dress is a fabric yes like 

00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:37.700
 Cotton quoted I love the cut that 

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:41.720
 has in the back they come with 

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:44.660
 some suspenders so bold at this junction 

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:46.940
 that is here is really beautiful and the 

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:50.360
 way that the dress really has 

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:53.060
 it makes it super flattering to do 

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:55.370
 that you see a very small waist and 

00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:57.329
 the blue color with squares I do not know 

00:00:55.370 --> 00:01:00.329
 remember how 

00:00:57.329 --> 00:01:02.909
 that time towards the 60's out there 

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:05.100
 it was written I bought it in silver in 

00:01:02.909 --> 00:01:07.740
 size m 

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:09.840
 and it cost me 26 dollars then I think 

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:12.870
 that was well priced because the 

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:15.660
 truth is that I have seen dresses 

00:01:12.870 --> 00:01:18.210
 more expensive and less beautiful that is 

00:01:15.660 --> 00:01:20.970
 then but like a mega bargain 

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:24.270
 the second dress is a dress and 

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:26.000
 more as well as summery and all this and the 

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:30.120
 truth is that I'm going 

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:32.250
 It's a summer city and I'm 

00:01:30.120 --> 00:01:35.940
 love the truth this dress is super 

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:38.450
 nice I like the flowers printed 

00:01:35.940 --> 00:01:40.770
 that comes in the part above here and what 

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:43.950
 simple it is at the bottom is 

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:45.510
 super cool very comfortable the cut is fine 

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:48.460
 pretty is up so it's not 

00:01:45.510 --> 00:01:51.430
 nothing revealing the dress is fine 

00:01:48.460 --> 00:01:54.549
 how can I say it very simple and well 

00:01:51.430 --> 00:01:56.800
 discrete and I like the color that is like that 

00:01:54.549 --> 00:02:00.070
 like this mint green color if 

00:01:56.800 --> 00:02:03.490
 pretty the priority part of here is 

00:02:00.070 --> 00:02:06.630
 super cute is like that romantic in the 

00:02:03.490 --> 00:02:09.100
 back is a little button like that in 

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:11.140
 golden and this here open that looks 

00:02:09.100 --> 00:02:12.940
 nice that you do not notice much the truth is 

00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:15.250
 very simple if you realize you do not have 

00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:16.930
 doing is nothing of openings nothing is 

00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:19.540
 very simple and I think they are those 

00:02:16.930 --> 00:02:22.570
 dresses that favors all kinds of 

00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:24.910
 body and the third and last little dress is 

00:02:22.570 --> 00:02:26.830
 this is an obvious color where 

00:02:24.910 --> 00:02:29.320
 he lived he needed a little black dress 

00:02:26.830 --> 00:02:32.410
 because I did not even have a dress like 

00:02:29.320 --> 00:02:35.650
 bold and simple is here the platel 

00:02:32.410 --> 00:02:38.200
 it is like cotton is finite the fabric 

00:02:35.650 --> 00:02:40.540
 but the stress removed or is like for a 

00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:42.850
 weather like I'm going here this dress 

00:02:40.540 --> 00:02:45.340
 it's really nice it has sleeves in the 

00:02:42.850 --> 00:02:47.830
 back part comes like this cut 

00:02:45.340 --> 00:02:52.110
 He cited this form of the cited this 

00:02:47.830 --> 00:02:52.110
 dress also takes a cumshot here 

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:59.640
 the right one is peach color peach 

00:02:56.510 --> 00:03:01.350
 likewise the same style of the second 

00:02:59.640 --> 00:03:03.810
 dress that at the top comes 

00:03:01.350 --> 00:03:06.990
 flowery this one I also decided to buy 

00:03:03.810 --> 00:03:10.350
 so this dress here all these 

00:03:06.990 --> 00:03:12.090
 dresses cost me 26 dollars all 

00:03:10.350 --> 00:03:15.630
 they were at the same price in 

00:03:12.090 --> 00:03:18.240
 practice the mold the sun and the truth what 

00:03:15.630 --> 00:03:22.050
 I bought because I saw one very similar to 

00:03:18.240 --> 00:03:24.470
 one of the two final jones and that's why 

00:03:22.050 --> 00:03:24.470
 I bought it 

00:03:27.650 --> 00:03:33.840
 I bought at the beginning of the month were these 

00:03:31.020 --> 00:03:35.730
 a little pill in optimal day and I already wanted 

00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:38.340
 long ago this shoe that this 

00:03:35.730 --> 00:03:40.200
 specific model and I did not buy them 

00:03:38.340 --> 00:03:43.020
 because they were each without optimal cost 

00:03:40.200 --> 00:03:45.840
 like 50 and something I said someday they're from 

00:03:43.020 --> 00:03:48.510
 put in discount and I offer and always 

00:03:45.840 --> 00:03:50.550
 estimated are put as in 50 60 by 

00:03:48.510 --> 00:03:52.170
 hundred percent discount and I reached 

00:03:50.550 --> 00:03:54.600
 buy it in 60 percent of 

00:03:52.170 --> 00:03:56.970
 discount and they cost me 25 dollars 

00:03:54.600 --> 00:03:58.510
 then it was like that until by 

00:03:56.970 --> 00:04:00.879
 funes may have 

00:03:58.510 --> 00:04:03.879
 as a fabric as well as music and 

00:04:00.879 --> 00:04:06.549
 very nice soul in the ten hits and 

00:04:03.879 --> 00:04:07.659
 I think it's going to look spectacular with 

00:04:06.549 --> 00:04:09.430
 this described here 

00:04:07.659 --> 00:04:13.030
 the third slippers are you here 

00:04:09.430 --> 00:04:15.940
 I bought it in river estor de rÃ­ocentro 

00:04:13.030 --> 00:04:18.010
 the ceibos and are the lomitas shoes 

00:04:15.940 --> 00:04:19.780
 and what caught my attention the most was 

00:04:18.010 --> 00:04:21.760
 this 

00:04:19.780 --> 00:04:23.710
 these beads that come here because 

00:04:21.760 --> 00:04:27.400
 They saw a lot and they look very pretty 

00:04:23.710 --> 00:04:29.919
 as delicate and I decided to buy this month 

00:04:27.400 --> 00:04:33.220
 two shoes because believe it or not only 

00:04:29.919 --> 00:04:34.389
 had a one shoe can be 

00:04:33.220 --> 00:04:36.250
 harassed up and down 

00:04:34.389 --> 00:04:39.190
 so it was like other 

00:04:36.250 --> 00:04:41.110
 more slippers to not only walk 

00:04:39.190 --> 00:04:42.730
 with the same then I decided to buy 

00:04:41.110 --> 00:04:44.980
 those blacks and these lomitas that I think 

00:04:42.730 --> 00:04:47.110
 that combine with everything prescribed this 

00:04:44.980 --> 00:04:50.590
 little dress here that came as a gift 

00:04:47.110 --> 00:04:52.240
 a shop called marc and feel 

00:04:50.590 --> 00:04:54.490
 that this studios was beautiful to me 

00:04:52.240 --> 00:04:57.330
 love the details of the frosts to 

00:04:54.490 --> 00:05:01.000
 I love the sides with mankita 

00:04:57.330 --> 00:05:02.530
 how sporty it looks I like it like that 

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:05.169
 adjust that can be combined with all 

00:05:02.530 --> 00:05:07.990
 then you can put those with black jean with 

00:05:05.169 --> 00:05:09.970
 leggings with shorts this you can 

00:05:07.990 --> 00:05:12.760
 use it only as a dress use it 

00:05:09.970 --> 00:05:15.040
 as a blouse or you know how very chameleon 

00:05:12.760 --> 00:05:17.710
 this dress and I really loved it myself 

00:05:15.040 --> 00:05:19.840
 I ordered it in size I because you always have 

00:05:17.710 --> 00:05:22.639
 what to ask for you resign in stores 

00:05:19.840 --> 00:05:25.280
 As little girls you should always say goodbye 

00:05:22.639 --> 00:05:28.849
 very large sizes to fit you 

00:05:25.280 --> 00:05:30.710
 really unlike these here 

00:05:28.849 --> 00:05:33.610
 I asked for it in size 

00:05:30.710 --> 00:05:35.800
 these here are in size m then 

00:05:33.610 --> 00:05:39.310
 ok something super soft and for something normal 

00:05:35.800 --> 00:05:42.280
 because it's a clothing hall I wanted to show 

00:05:39.310 --> 00:05:45.310
 a perfume that I bought this from here the 

00:05:42.280 --> 00:05:48.159
 midnight of fans of the fantasy line of 

00:05:45.310 --> 00:05:50.949
 Britney Spears to this I bought it 

00:05:48.159 --> 00:05:53.320
 basically because some of you 

00:05:50.949 --> 00:05:56.500
 They said it smelled really good 

00:05:53.320 --> 00:06:00.460
 the truth is that it was not like a love 

00:05:56.500 --> 00:06:02.860
 or something that water or the delicious 

00:06:00.460 --> 00:06:04.920
 remember a candy and you do not feel it 

00:06:02.860 --> 00:06:07.240
 I feel the smell 

00:06:04.920 --> 00:06:10.020
 the smell is like 

00:06:07.240 --> 00:06:13.020
 it's sweet it's like 

00:06:10.020 --> 00:06:16.689
 fruity yeah of fruits are not being that 

00:06:13.020 --> 00:06:19.629
 it smells ugly just does not smell 

00:06:16.689 --> 00:06:22.599
 it's so rich it smells like a and like 

00:06:19.629 --> 00:06:24.849
 environmental then I do not like it that much 

00:06:22.599 --> 00:06:27.519
 but there they are using at night 

00:06:24.849 --> 00:06:29.079
 because they say it's like for the night and 

00:06:27.519 --> 00:06:31.529
 if only for the night I am 

00:06:29.079 --> 00:06:31.529
 using and 

00:06:32.539 --> 00:06:36.419
 although girls I hope that they have 

00:06:34.289 --> 00:06:38.400
