this transmission so that when he comes

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:26.870 
this transmission so that when he comes
over<00:01:25.470> next<00:01:25.770> time<00:01:25.950> whenever<00:01:26.250> that<00:01:26.369> is<00:01:26.430> he<00:01:26.729> can

00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:26.880 
over next time whenever that is he can

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:28.460 
over next time whenever that is he can
clean<00:01:27.150> it<00:01:27.299> I<00:01:27.479> don't<00:01:27.869> know<00:01:27.960> if<00:01:28.020> you<00:01:28.110> can<00:01:28.200> see

up the car and lower it off these jacks

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:50.450 
up the car and lower it off these jacks
hands<00:01:47.159> a<00:01:47.280> little<00:01:47.399> bit<00:01:47.689> so<00:01:48.689> that<00:01:49.159> the<00:01:50.159> internal

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:50.460 
hands a little bit so that the internal

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:52.280 
hands a little bit so that the internal
just<00:01:50.759> kind<00:01:50.970> of<00:01:51.030> well<00:01:51.630> the<00:01:51.750> car<00:01:51.930> will<00:01:52.020> go<00:01:52.110> down

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:52.290 
just kind of well the car will go down

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:53.510 
just kind of well the car will go down
the<00:01:52.470> engine<00:01:52.649> will<00:01:52.740> stay<00:01:52.890> where<00:01:53.040> it<00:01:53.100> is<00:01:53.280> and

00:01:53.510 --> 00:01:53.520 
the engine will stay where it is and

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:57.590 
the engine will stay where it is and
hopefully<00:01:54.329> slide<00:01:54.720> forward<00:01:55.229> and<00:01:56.479> we'll<00:01:57.479> see

00:01:57.590 --> 00:01:57.600 
hopefully slide forward and we'll see

00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:00.800 
hopefully slide forward and we'll see
how<00:01:57.659> that<00:01:57.840> works

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:00.810

old<00:05:20.100> oil<00:05:20.280> in<00:05:20.520> it<00:05:20.669> so<00:05:20.910> I'll<00:05:21.479> pull<00:05:21.660> the<00:05:21.750> pan<00:05:21.960> off

00:05:22.130 --> 00:05:22.140 
old oil in it so I'll pull the pan off

00:05:22.140 --> 00:05:25.730 
old oil in it so I'll pull the pan off
for<00:05:22.320> sure<00:05:22.530> we'll<00:05:23.310> look<00:05:23.430> at<00:05:23.669> it<00:05:23.820> and<00:05:24.740> replace

00:05:25.730 --> 00:05:25.740 
for sure we'll look at it and replace

00:05:25.740 --> 00:05:27.500 
for sure we'll look at it and replace
oil<00:05:26.220> pan<00:05:26.400> gasket<00:05:26.610> while<00:05:26.970> we're<00:05:27.090> down<00:05:27.180> here<00:05:27.240> in

00:05:27.500 --> 00:05:27.510 
oil pan gasket while we're down here in

00:05:27.510 --> 00:05:30.830 
oil pan gasket while we're down here in
Java<00:05:27.840> cover<00:05:28.050> gaskets<00:05:28.530> and<00:05:28.680> all<00:05:29.610> that<00:05:29.790> stuff<00:05:30.090> I

00:05:30.830 --> 00:05:30.840 
Java cover gaskets and all that stuff I

00:05:30.840 --> 00:05:33.590 
Java cover gaskets and all that stuff I
went<00:05:31.710> ahead<00:05:31.800> and<00:05:32.010> took<00:05:32.100> the<00:05:32.280> cap<00:05:33.000> off<00:05:33.240> when<00:05:33.570> I

00:05:33.590 --> 00:05:33.600 
went ahead and took the cap off when I

00:05:33.600 --> 00:05:35.779 
went ahead and took the cap off when I
was<00:05:33.750> pulling<00:05:34.110> it<00:05:34.200> because<00:05:34.500> the<00:05:34.789> distributor

00:05:35.779 --> 00:05:35.789 
was pulling it because the distributor

00:05:35.789 --> 00:05:39.080 
was pulling it because the distributor
was<00:05:35.940> pretty<00:05:36.630> close<00:05:36.810> to<00:05:37.050> the<00:05:37.310> firewall<00:05:38.310> you

00:05:39.080 --> 00:05:39.090 
was pretty close to the firewall you

00:05:39.090 --> 00:05:40.760 
was pretty close to the firewall you
know<00:05:39.180> was<00:05:39.330> that<00:05:39.360> such<00:05:39.660> an<00:05:39.780> angle<00:05:40.110> and<00:05:40.500> I<00:05:40.560> didn't

00:05:40.760 --> 00:05:40.770 
know was that such an angle and I didn't

00:05:40.770 --> 00:05:43.100 
know was that such an angle and I didn't
want<00:05:40.919> to<00:05:41.039> break<00:05:42.000> the<00:05:42.120> cap<00:05:42.330> or<00:05:42.660> break<00:05:42.960> this

00:05:43.100 --> 00:05:43.110 
want to break the cap or break this

00:05:43.110 --> 00:05:44.900 
want to break the cap or break this
ribbon<00:05:43.440> off<00:05:43.620> so<00:05:43.919> I<00:05:43.950> took<00:05:44.190> that<00:05:44.310> off<00:05:44.370> and<00:05:44.700> got<00:05:44.820> it

00:05:44.900 --> 00:05:44.910 
ribbon off so I took that off and got it

00:05:44.910 --> 00:05:47.659 
ribbon off so I took that off and got it
out<00:05:45.030> of<00:05:45.090> the<00:05:45.150> way<00:05:45.300> what<00:05:46.130> all<00:05:47.130> in<00:05:47.310> all<00:05:47.430> it<00:05:47.610> went

00:05:47.659 --> 00:05:47.669 
out of the way what all in all it went

00:05:47.669 --> 00:05:51.409 
out of the way what all in all it went
pretty<00:05:47.850> nice<00:05:48.150> I<00:05:48.510> think<00:05:48.810> I<00:05:50.240> think<00:05:51.240> it<00:05:51.330> went

00:05:51.409 --> 00:05:51.419 
pretty nice I think I think it went

00:05:51.419 --> 00:05:52.910 
pretty nice I think I think it went
pretty<00:05:51.539> slick

00:05:52.910 --> 00:05:52.920 
pretty slick

00:05:52.920 --> 00:05:55.850 
pretty slick
I<00:05:53.600> don't<00:05:54.600> know<00:05:54.690> what<00:05:54.840> that<00:05:55.020> is<00:05:55.230> or<00:05:55.440> where<00:05:55.770> it

00:05:55.850 --> 00:05:55.860 
I don't know what that is or where it

00:05:55.860 --> 00:05:57.370 
I don't know what that is or where it
came<00:05:56.010> from

00:05:57.370 --> 00:05:57.380 
came from

00:05:57.380 --> 00:06:00.460 
came from
yeah<00:05:58.380> well<00:05:58.590> whatever<00:05:58.950> we'll<00:05:59.280> figure<00:05:59.460> it<00:05:59.550> out

00:06:00.460 --> 00:06:00.470 
yeah well whatever we'll figure it out

00:06:00.470 --> 00:06:02.660 
yeah well whatever we'll figure it out
well<00:06:01.470> I<00:06:01.590> guess<00:06:01.980> my<00:06:02.100> brother's<00:06:02.370> got<00:06:02.490> another

00:06:02.660 --> 00:06:02.670 
well I guess my brother's got another

00:06:02.670 --> 00:06:07.010 
well I guess my brother's got another
project<00:06:02.940> when<00:06:03.270> he<00:06:03.330> comes<00:06:03.480> around<00:06:05.990> well<00:06:06.990> a

00:06:07.010 --> 00:06:07.020 
project when he comes around well a

00:06:07.020 --> 00:06:09.020 
project when he comes around well a
couple<00:06:07.290> of<00:06:07.410> people<00:06:07.590> have<00:06:07.830> asked<00:06:08.250> why<00:06:08.820> we

00:06:09.020 --> 00:06:09.030 
couple of people have asked why we

00:06:09.030 --> 00:06:10.490 
couple of people have asked why we
pulled<00:06:09.330> them<00:06:09.420> both<00:06:09.600> out<00:06:09.840> instead<00:06:10.140> of<00:06:10.200> just<00:06:10.290> a

00:06:10.490 --> 00:06:10.500 
pulled them both out instead of just a

00:06:10.500 --> 00:06:13.300 
pulled them both out instead of just a
transmission<00:06:10.980> to<00:06:11.310> take<00:06:12.120> care<00:06:12.300> of<00:06:12.330> that<00:06:12.510> leak

00:06:13.300 --> 00:06:13.310 
transmission to take care of that leak

00:06:13.310 --> 00:06:16.430 
transmission to take care of that leak
the<00:06:14.310> main<00:06:14.490> reason<00:06:14.940> was<00:06:15.120> you<00:06:15.480> know<00:06:16.020> since<00:06:16.320> we

00:06:16.430 --> 00:06:16.440 
the main reason was you know since we

00:06:16.440 --> 00:06:17.600 
the main reason was you know since we
had<00:06:16.530> to<00:06:16.620> pull<00:06:16.740> the<00:06:16.830> transmission<00:06:17.010> out<00:06:17.460> to

00:06:17.600 --> 00:06:17.610 
had to pull the transmission out to

00:06:17.610 --> 00:06:20.720 
had to pull the transmission out to
drive<00:06:17.790> the<00:06:17.940> car<00:06:18.120> anywhere<00:06:18.420> anyway<00:06:19.460> we<00:06:20.460> figured

00:06:20.720 --> 00:06:20.730 
drive the car anywhere anyway we figured

00:06:20.730 --> 00:06:22.820 
drive the car anywhere anyway we figured
we'd<00:06:20.880> pull<00:06:21.060> them<00:06:21.150> both<00:06:21.360> out<00:06:21.600> and<00:06:21.930> clean<00:06:22.740> them

00:06:22.820 --> 00:06:22.830 
we'd pull them both out and clean them

00:06:22.830 --> 00:06:24.790 
we'd pull them both out and clean them
both<00:06:22.980> up<00:06:23.250> and<00:06:23.460> my<00:06:23.730> brother's<00:06:24.000> wants<00:06:24.420> to<00:06:24.540> paint

00:06:24.790 --> 00:06:24.800 
both up and my brother's wants to paint

00:06:24.800 --> 00:06:27.500 
both up and my brother's wants to paint
the<00:06:25.800> engine<00:06:25.980> and<00:06:26.340> all<00:06:26.460> the<00:06:26.640> cleanup<00:06:27.300> all

00:06:27.500 --> 00:06:27.510 
the engine and all the cleanup all

00:06:27.510 --> 00:06:30.950 
the engine and all the cleanup all
little<00:06:27.750> parts<00:06:28.020> on<00:06:28.200> there<00:06:28.440> and<00:06:29.750> he's<00:06:30.750> going<00:06:30.900> to

00:06:30.950 --> 00:06:30.960 
little parts on there and he's going to

00:06:30.960 --> 00:06:33.200 
little parts on there and he's going to
go<00:06:31.140> ahead<00:06:31.350> and<00:06:31.470> I<00:06:31.650> believe<00:06:32.610> he's<00:06:32.820> gonna<00:06:32.910> paint

00:06:33.200 --> 00:06:33.210 
go ahead and I believe he's gonna paint

00:06:33.210 --> 00:06:36.320 
go ahead and I believe he's gonna paint
all<00:06:33.390> this<00:06:33.630> in<00:06:33.930> here<00:06:34.200> too<00:06:34.410> and<00:06:35.340> the<00:06:35.940> fenders<00:06:36.300> and

00:06:36.320 --> 00:06:36.330 
all this in here too and the fenders and

00:06:36.330 --> 00:06:38.660 
all this in here too and the fenders and
the<00:06:36.540> hood<00:06:36.600> and<00:06:37.020> he's<00:06:37.860> gonna<00:06:38.040> do<00:06:38.460> all<00:06:38.490> the

00:06:38.660 --> 00:06:38.670 
the hood and he's gonna do all the

00:06:38.670 --> 00:06:41.960 
the hood and he's gonna do all the
bodywork<00:06:38.820> to<00:06:39.270> that<00:06:39.860> so<00:06:40.860> I<00:06:41.190> figure<00:06:41.820> we're

00:06:41.960 --> 00:06:41.970 
bodywork to that so I figure we're

00:06:41.970 --> 00:06:43.370 
bodywork to that so I figure we're
taking<00:06:42.240> it<00:06:42.330> all<00:06:42.450> apart<00:06:42.540> anyway<00:06:43.020> we<00:06:43.170> might<00:06:43.320> as

00:06:43.370 --> 00:06:43.380 
taking it all apart anyway we might as

00:06:43.380 --> 00:06:46.040 
taking it all apart anyway we might as
well<00:06:43.440> pull<00:06:43.680> the<00:06:43.800> engine<00:06:44.720> one<00:06:45.720> thing<00:06:45.930> we

00:06:46.040 --> 00:06:46.050 
well pull the engine one thing we

00:06:46.050 --> 00:06:49.190 
well pull the engine one thing we
probably<00:06:46.230> could<00:06:46.800> have<00:06:46.860> done<00:06:47.450> first<00:06:48.450> was<00:06:48.870> take

00:06:49.190 --> 00:06:49.200 
probably could have done first was take

00:06:49.200 --> 00:06:51.440 
probably could have done first was take
the<00:06:49.410> front<00:06:49.950> clip<00:06:50.190> off<00:06:50.370> and<00:06:50.880> then<00:06:51.060> just<00:06:51.240> yank

00:06:51.440 --> 00:06:51.450 
the front clip off and then just yank

00:06:51.450 --> 00:06:54.290 
the front clip off and then just yank
themes<00:06:51.720> you're<00:06:51.840> not<00:06:51.930> that<00:06:52.050> way<00:06:52.320> but<00:06:53.300> whatever

00:06:54.290 --> 00:06:54.300 
themes you're not that way but whatever

00:06:54.300 --> 00:06:57.440 
themes you're not that way but whatever
this<00:06:54.480> way<00:06:54.630> works<00:06:54.870> too<00:06:55.140> I<00:06:56.130> think<00:06:56.730> I<00:06:56.970> prefer<00:06:57.270> this

00:06:57.440 --> 00:06:57.450 
this way works too I think I prefer this

00:06:57.450 --> 00:07:00.470 
this way works too I think I prefer this
way<00:06:57.710> just<00:06:58.710> because<00:06:59.040> you<00:07:00.000> know<00:07:00.090> I<00:07:00.120> don't<00:07:00.360> want

00:07:00.470 --> 00:07:00.480 
way just because you know I don't want

00:07:00.480 --> 00:07:01.910 
way just because you know I don't want
to<00:07:00.510> have<00:07:00.660> a<00:07:00.690> front<00:07:00.990> clip<00:07:01.200> sitting<00:07:01.500> here<00:07:01.710> and<00:07:01.830> an

00:07:01.910 --> 00:07:01.920 
to have a front clip sitting here and an

00:07:01.920 --> 00:07:04.220 
to have a front clip sitting here and an
engine<00:07:02.250> sitting<00:07:02.520> over<00:07:02.670> here<00:07:02.910> and<00:07:03.120> have<00:07:03.930> no

00:07:04.220 --> 00:07:04.230 
engine sitting over here and have no

00:07:04.230 --> 00:07:07.010 
engine sitting over here and have no
room<00:07:04.440> for<00:07:04.710> the<00:07:04.800> walls<00:07:05.760> 'mobile<00:07:06.150> for<00:07:06.930> the

00:07:07.010 --> 00:07:07.020 
room for the walls 'mobile for the

00:07:07.020 --> 00:07:08.150 
room for the walls 'mobile for the
wintertime<00:07:07.440> because<00:07:07.530> I<00:07:07.740> don't<00:07:07.890> think<00:07:08.070> he's

00:07:08.150 --> 00:07:08.160 
wintertime because I don't think he's

00:07:08.160 --> 00:07:12.520 
wintertime because I don't think he's
gonna<00:07:08.280> get<00:07:08.550> to<00:07:08.730> finishing<00:07:09.300> this<00:07:09.450> this<00:07:09.960> year<00:07:10.940> so

00:07:12.520 --> 00:07:12.530 
gonna get to finishing this this year so

00:07:12.530 --> 00:07:14.600 
gonna get to finishing this this year so
that's<00:07:13.530> why<00:07:13.710> we<00:07:13.860> pulled<00:07:14.070> them<00:07:14.130> both<00:07:14.280> out<00:07:14.490> at

00:07:14.600 --> 00:07:14.610 
that's why we pulled them both out at

00:07:14.610 --> 00:07:18.290 
that's why we pulled them both out at
once<00:07:15.290> do<00:07:16.290> the<00:07:16.410> engine<00:07:16.650> first<00:07:16.770> I<00:07:16.980> suppose<00:07:17.300> once

00:07:18.290 --> 00:07:18.300 
once do the engine first I suppose once

00:07:18.300 --> 00:07:20.120 
once do the engine first I suppose once
that's<00:07:18.510> all<00:07:18.660> cleaned<00:07:19.020> up<00:07:19.140> and<00:07:19.380> put<00:07:20.010> back

00:07:20.120 --> 00:07:20.130 
that's all cleaned up and put back

00:07:20.130 --> 00:07:21.950 
that's all cleaned up and put back
together<00:07:20.310> and<00:07:20.610> ready<00:07:20.790> to<00:07:20.910> go<00:07:21.060> we'll<00:07:21.780> probably

00:07:21.950 --> 00:07:21.960 
together and ready to go we'll probably

00:07:21.960 --> 00:07:23.090 
together and ready to go we'll probably
set<00:07:22.410> it<00:07:22.440> aside

00:07:23.090 --> 00:07:23.100 
set it aside

00:07:23.100 --> 00:07:25.070 
set it aside
shove<00:07:24.060> it<00:07:24.180> maybe<00:07:24.480> over<00:07:24.660> there<00:07:24.750> in<00:07:24.870> the<00:07:24.930> corner

00:07:25.070 --> 00:07:25.080 
shove it maybe over there in the corner

00:07:25.080 --> 00:07:27.110 
shove it maybe over there in the corner
or<00:07:25.320> something<00:07:25.350> and<00:07:25.890> then<00:07:26.580> my<00:07:26.730> brother<00:07:26.910> can

00:07:27.110 --> 00:07:27.120 
or something and then my brother can

00:07:27.120 --> 00:07:29.540 
or something and then my brother can
work<00:07:27.240> on<00:07:27.390> this<00:07:27.510> front<00:07:28.440> clip<00:07:28.680> stuff<00:07:28.950> and<00:07:29.280> in

00:07:29.540 --> 00:07:29.550 
work on this front clip stuff and in

00:07:29.550 --> 00:07:31.600 
work on this front clip stuff and in
here<00:07:29.760> in<00:07:29.850> the<00:07:29.910> firewall<00:07:30.240> and<00:07:30.450> all<00:07:30.540> that

00:07:31.600 --> 00:07:31.610 
here in the firewall and all that

00:07:31.610 --> 00:07:33.890 
here in the firewall and all that
probably<00:07:32.610> set<00:07:32.790> that<00:07:32.970> right<00:07:33.210> up<00:07:33.390> front<00:07:33.510> and<00:07:33.840> he

00:07:33.890 --> 00:07:33.900 
probably set that right up front and he

00:07:33.900 --> 00:07:36.800 
probably set that right up front and he
can<00:07:34.020> work<00:07:34.140> on<00:07:34.350> it<00:07:34.970> so<00:07:35.970> that's<00:07:36.120> why<00:07:36.300> we<00:07:36.510> did<00:07:36.660> what

00:07:36.800 --> 00:07:36.810 
can work on it so that's why we did what

00:07:36.810 --> 00:07:38.870 
can work on it so that's why we did what
we<00:07:36.960> did<00:07:36.990> the<00:07:37.260> way<00:07:37.350> we<00:07:37.530> did<00:07:37.650> it<00:07:37.770> just<00:07:38.670> in<00:07:38.850> case

00:07:38.870 --> 00:07:38.880 
we did the way we did it just in case

00:07:38.880 --> 00:07:41.630 
we did the way we did it just in case
anybody<00:07:39.390> was<00:07:39.510> wondering
