00:01:46.830 --> 00:01:49.220 
slightly burnt tasting chicken so I took
that<00:01:47.190> and<00:01:47.340> refined<00:01:47.760> it<00:01:47.940> I<00:01:48.060> realized<00:01:48.270> that<00:01:48.720> what

00:01:49.220 --> 00:01:49.230 
that and refined it I realized that what

00:01:49.230 --> 00:01:50.780 
that and refined it I realized that what
she<00:01:49.409> was<00:01:49.530> doing<00:01:49.860> was<00:01:49.950> actually<00:01:50.340> it's<00:01:50.700> a

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:50.790 
she was doing was actually it's a

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:53.360 
she was doing was actually it's a
shortcut<00:01:51.120> because<00:01:52.080> you<00:01:52.470> don't<00:01:52.650> have<00:01:52.740> to<00:01:53.040> stop

00:01:53.360 --> 00:01:53.370 
shortcut because you don't have to stop

00:01:53.370 --> 00:01:55.880 
shortcut because you don't have to stop
and<00:01:53.670> brown<00:01:53.970> the<00:01:54.240> chicken<00:01:54.270> you<00:01:55.200> make<00:01:55.380> the<00:01:55.620> brown

00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:55.890 
and brown the chicken you make the brown

00:01:55.890 --> 00:01:58.520 
and brown the chicken you make the brown
flavor<00:01:56.400> first<00:01:57.060> and<00:01:57.360> then<00:01:57.750> you<00:01:57.780> just<00:01:58.140> throw<00:01:58.380> the

00:01:58.520 --> 00:01:58.530 
flavor first and then you just throw the

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:00.980 
flavor first and then you just throw the
chicken<00:01:58.710> in<00:01:59.040> and<00:01:59.250> just<00:01:59.370> walk<00:01:59.760> away<00:02:00.000> so<00:02:00.960> I

00:02:00.980 --> 00:02:00.990 
chicken in and just walk away so I

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:03.140 
chicken in and just walk away so I
refined<00:02:01.409> it<00:02:01.680> you<00:02:01.920> know<00:02:02.040> I<00:02:02.070> I<00:02:02.220> don't<00:02:02.790> write

00:02:03.140 --> 00:02:03.150

like a little bit of rum and because

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:16.490 
like a little bit of rum and because
it's<00:02:14.400> such<00:02:14.549> a<00:02:14.580> sweet<00:02:15.060> dish<00:02:15.569> I<00:02:15.870> also<00:02:16.110> added<00:02:16.349> a

00:02:16.490 --> 00:02:16.500 
it's such a sweet dish I also added a

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:17.930 
it's such a sweet dish I also added a
little<00:02:16.650> vinegar<00:02:17.100> at<00:02:17.190> the<00:02:17.310> end<00:02:17.430> it<00:02:17.580> just<00:02:17.610> sort

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:17.940 
little vinegar at the end it just sort

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:18.650 
little vinegar at the end it just sort
of<00:02:18.000> balance

00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:18.660 
of balance

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:20.060 
of balance
but<00:02:18.930> it's<00:02:19.080> true<00:02:19.200> to<00:02:19.500> what<00:02:19.620> I<00:02:19.650> learned<00:02:19.920> in

00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:20.070 
but it's true to what I learned in

00:02:20.070 --> 00:02:22.430 
but it's true to what I learned in
Grenada<00:02:20.400> in<00:02:20.610> it<00:02:20.730> it<00:02:21.150> reflects<00:02:21.630> those<00:02:21.900> those

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:22.440 
Grenada in it it reflects those those

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:23.930 
Grenada in it it reflects those those
global<00:02:22.740> flavors<00:02:23.040> that<00:02:23.250> are<00:02:23.400> in<00:02:23.520> the<00:02:23.610> book<00:02:23.760> as

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:23.940 
global flavors that are in the book as

00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:27.960 
global flavors that are in the book as
well

00:02:27.960 --> 00:02:27.970 

00:02:27.970 --> 00:02:31.110 

yeah<00:02:28.720> I<00:02:28.780> think<00:02:29.520> Prince<00:02:30.520> Edward<00:02:30.760> Island's

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:31.120 
yeah I think Prince Edward Island's

00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:33.120 
yeah I think Prince Edward Island's
cooking<00:02:31.510> is<00:02:31.600> very<00:02:32.020> similar<00:02:32.530> and<00:02:32.560> reflective

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:33.130 
cooking is very similar and reflective

00:02:33.130 --> 00:02:35.010 
cooking is very similar and reflective
of<00:02:33.250> the<00:02:33.430> way<00:02:33.550> everybody<00:02:33.850> cooks<00:02:34.240> across<00:02:34.390> Canada

00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:35.020 
of the way everybody cooks across Canada

00:02:35.020 --> 00:02:36.720 
of the way everybody cooks across Canada
and<00:02:35.110> many<00:02:35.290> many<00:02:35.500> we<00:02:35.680> in<00:02:35.950> essence<00:02:36.340> that<00:02:36.580> the

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:36.730 
and many many we in essence that the

00:02:36.730 --> 00:02:38.550 
and many many we in essence that the
Prince<00:02:37.000> Edward<00:02:37.270> Island<00:02:37.420> style<00:02:37.960> of<00:02:38.140> cooking<00:02:38.320> is

00:02:38.550 --> 00:02:38.560 
Prince Edward Island style of cooking is

00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:40.200 
Prince Edward Island style of cooking is
just<00:02:38.620> to<00:02:38.950> use<00:02:39.100> what's<00:02:39.310> around<00:02:39.430> you<00:02:39.850> what's<00:02:40.030> in

just to use what's around you what's in

00:02:40.210 --> 00:02:42.990 
just to use what's around you what's in
season<00:02:40.450> what's<00:02:40.870> now<00:02:41.140> what's<00:02:41.560> here<00:02:41.980> and<00:02:42.160> and<00:02:42.340> so

season what's now what's here and and so

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:45.240 
season what's now what's here and and so
much<00:02:43.270> of<00:02:43.300> that<00:02:43.630> is<00:02:43.900> reflected<00:02:44.800> in<00:02:44.890> the<00:02:45.010> book

00:02:45.240 --> 00:02:45.250 
much of that is reflected in the book

00:02:45.250 --> 00:02:47.760 
much of that is reflected in the book
and<00:02:45.550> it<00:02:45.880> will<00:02:46.360> feel<00:02:46.570> very<00:02:46.600> Canadian<00:02:47.530> as<00:02:47.710> a
