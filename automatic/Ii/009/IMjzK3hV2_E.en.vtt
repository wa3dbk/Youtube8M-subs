reasons I'll just name a few but one

00:00:14.309 --> 00:00:15.560 
reasons I'll just name a few but one
reason<00:00:14.490> it's<00:00:14.730> because<00:00:14.849> there<00:00:15.150> haven't<00:00:15.299> really

00:00:15.560 --> 00:00:15.570 
reason it's because there haven't really

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:17.240

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:31.550 
see a whole lot more and also another
reason<00:00:30.179> is<00:00:30.390> because<00:00:30.420> I<00:00:30.990> feel<00:00:31.170> like<00:00:31.260> I<00:00:31.380> need<00:00:31.529> to

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:31.560 
reason is because I feel like I need to

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:33.290 
reason is because I feel like I need to
be<00:00:31.710> spending<00:00:32.160> my<00:00:32.309> money<00:00:32.340> on<00:00:32.610> more<00:00:32.850> important

things and DVDs and then the biggest
reason<00:00:36.899> of<00:00:36.989> all<00:00:37.140> is<00:00:37.290> because<00:00:37.469> I<00:00:38.070> don't<00:00:38.489> know<00:00:38.610> if

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:38.700

00:03:02.900 --> 00:03:02.910 
not like this movie mainly because I

00:03:02.910 --> 00:03:06.200 
not like this movie mainly because I
just<00:03:03.090> thought<00:03:03.210> it<00:03:03.360> was<00:03:03.540> way<00:03:04.050> too<00:03:04.080> long<00:03:05.210> but

00:03:06.200 --> 00:03:06.210 
just thought it was way too long but

00:03:06.210 --> 00:03:08.300 
just thought it was way too long but
however<00:03:06.660> I<00:03:06.750> did<00:03:06.960> see<00:03:07.140> clips<00:03:07.440> of<00:03:07.650> it<00:03:07.830> on<00:03:08.070> blu-ray

00:03:08.300 --> 00:03:08.310 
however I did see clips of it on blu-ray

00:03:08.310 --> 00:03:09.620 
however I did see clips of it on blu-ray
and<00:03:08.580> I<00:03:08.640> thought<00:03:08.820> that<00:03:09.060> looked<00:03:09.300> really

00:03:09.620 --> 00:03:09.630 
and I thought that looked really

00:03:09.630 --> 00:03:11.090 
and I thought that looked really
stunning<00:03:10.050> so<00:03:10.290> I<00:03:10.380> just<00:03:10.560> bought<00:03:10.740> it<00:03:10.860> for<00:03:10.890> that

00:03:11.090 --> 00:03:11.100 
stunning so I just bought it for that

00:03:11.100 --> 00:03:13.670 
stunning so I just bought it for that
reason<00:03:11.250> alone<00:03:11.670> and<00:03:12.180> I<00:03:13.020> did<00:03:13.200> give<00:03:13.350> it<00:03:13.380> another

00:03:13.670 --> 00:03:13.680 
reason alone and I did give it another

00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:16.520 
reason alone and I did give it another
try<00:03:13.980> and<00:03:14.400> I<00:03:14.610> still<00:03:15.000> didn't<00:03:15.240> like<00:03:15.360> it<00:03:15.630> and<00:03:15.990> in

00:03:16.520 --> 00:03:16.530

00:04:15.489 --> 00:04:15.499 
show you the second one because it looks

00:04:15.499 --> 00:04:17.289

exactly the same as this one only the

00:04:17.299 --> 00:04:18.849 
exactly the same as this one only the
only<00:04:17.419> difference<00:04:17.780> is<00:04:17.900> that<00:04:17.930> it's<00:04:18.169> silver<00:04:18.650> and

00:04:18.849 --> 00:04:18.859 
only difference is that it's silver and

00:04:18.859 --> 00:04:26.409 
only difference is that it's silver and
not<00:04:19.160> blue<00:04:21.820> so<00:04:23.380> there's<00:04:24.380> that<00:04:24.650> one<00:04:25.210> it's<00:04:26.210> a<00:04:26.270> good

because<00:04:41.180> I'm<00:04:41.300> a<00:04:41.330> fan<00:04:41.599> of<00:04:41.630> the<00:04:41.930> first<00:04:42.410> two

00:04:42.670 --> 00:04:42.680 
because I'm a fan of the first two

because I'm a fan of the first two
Terminator<00:04:43.160> movies<00:04:43.580> and<00:04:43.880> I<00:04:44.090> just<00:04:44.360> wanted<00:04:44.509> to

see what this was like and it was cheap

00:04:46.280 --> 00:04:49.180 
see what this was like and it was cheap
so<00:04:46.310> I<00:04:46.639> just<00:04:47.500> figured<00:04:48.500> I'd<00:04:48.590> give<00:04:48.740> it<00:04:48.770> a<00:04:48.919> shot
