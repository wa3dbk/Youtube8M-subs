00:01:45.289 --> 00:01:45.299 
centimeters tall in the middle so you

00:01:45.299 --> 00:01:47.300 
centimeters tall in the middle so you
won't<00:01:45.540> have<00:01:45.659> any<00:01:45.780> problems<00:01:46.229> getting<00:01:46.439> changed

won't have any problems getting changed

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:48.859 
won't have any problems getting changed
but<00:01:47.670> you<00:01:47.729> know<00:01:47.820> what<00:01:47.939> I<00:01:48.000> reckon<00:01:48.270> the<00:01:48.360> clincher

00:01:48.859 --> 00:01:48.869 
but you know what I reckon the clincher

00:01:48.869 --> 00:01:51.499 
but you know what I reckon the clincher
is<00:01:49.020> for<00:01:49.229> this<00:01:49.350> tent<00:01:49.680> it's<00:01:50.610> the<00:01:50.790> fact<00:01:51.090> that<00:01:51.180> it

00:01:51.499 --> 00:01:51.509 
is for this tent it's the fact that it

00:01:51.509 --> 00:01:54.319 
is for this tent it's the fact that it
actually<00:01:51.930> comes<00:01:52.409> with<00:01:52.770> an<00:01:52.920> adequate<00:01:53.610> size<00:01:53.850> bag

00:01:54.319 --> 00:01:54.329 
actually comes with an adequate size bag

00:01:54.329 --> 00:01:57.230 
actually comes with an adequate size bag
so<00:01:54.780> after<00:01:55.439> you've<00:01:55.560> rolled<00:01:55.770> all<00:01:56.070> up<00:01:56.310> it<00:01:56.790> slips
