00:00:09.809 --> 00:00:12.350 
middle seat here and we're going to be
starting<00:00:09.929> out<00:00:10.170> on<00:00:10.290> a<00:00:10.590> and<00:00:11.059> just<00:00:12.059> playing<00:00:12.269> a

00:00:12.350 --> 00:00:12.360 
starting out on a and just playing a

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:14.720 
starting out on a and just playing a
basic<00:00:12.690> chord<00:00:12.929> you<00:00:13.049> have<00:00:13.200> a<00:00:13.440> e<00:00:13.679> and<00:00:14.219> another<00:00:14.490> a

00:00:14.720 --> 00:00:14.730 
basic chord you have a e and another a

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:16.400 
basic chord you have a e and another a
and<00:00:15.030> it's<00:00:15.599> going<00:00:15.719> to<00:00:15.780> be<00:00:15.839> the<00:00:15.929> left<00:00:16.080> hand<00:00:16.289> of

00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:16.410 
and it's going to be the left hand of

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:19.730 
and it's going to be the left hand of
course<00:00:16.730> so<00:00:17.730> the<00:00:18.600> way<00:00:18.690> we<00:00:18.840> do<00:00:18.930> it<00:00:18.960> is<00:00:19.260> we're

00:00:19.730 --> 00:00:19.740 
course so the way we do it is we're

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:25.250 
course so the way we do it is we're
playing<00:00:19.949> 34<00:00:20.460> times<00:00:20.760> so<00:00:21.090> we<00:00:21.119> play<00:00:23.810> and<00:00:24.810> then<00:00:25.170> we

00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:25.260 
playing 34 times so we play and then we

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:30.589 
playing 34 times so we play and then we
move<00:00:25.439> down<00:00:25.730> to<00:00:26.730> e<00:00:27.090> b<00:00:27.930> &amp;<00:00:28.650> E<00:00:28.949> for<00:00:29.760> the<00:00:30.119> second<00:00:30.570> part

00:00:30.589 --> 00:00:30.599 
move down to e b &amp; E for the second part

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:41.060 
move down to e b &amp; E for the second part
of<00:00:30.810> the<00:00:30.869> court<00:00:38.660> so<00:00:39.660> that's<00:00:39.840> basically<00:00:40.590> how<00:00:40.980> you

00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:41.070 
of the court so that's basically how you

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:43.040 
of the court so that's basically how you
start<00:00:41.430> out<00:00:41.610> it<00:00:42.239> doesn't<00:00:42.420> really<00:00:42.540> get<00:00:42.750> too<00:00:42.899> much

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:43.050 
start out it doesn't really get too much

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:44.240 
start out it doesn't really get too much
more<00:00:43.230> complicated<00:00:43.500> with<00:00:43.829> that<00:00:43.920> in<00:00:44.010> the<00:00:44.040> left

00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:44.250 
more complicated with that in the left

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:47.510 
more complicated with that in the left
hand<00:00:44.430> you<00:00:44.700> go<00:00:44.879> here<00:00:45.719> first<00:00:45.960> and<00:00:46.350> down<00:00:46.980> to<00:00:47.340> eat

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:47.520 
hand you go here first and down to eat

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:51.080 
hand you go here first and down to eat
and<00:00:49.370> you<00:00:50.370> don't<00:00:50.489> really<00:00:50.579> have<00:00:50.700> to<00:00:50.760> change<00:00:51.030> your

00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:51.090 
and you don't really have to change your

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:52.369 
and you don't really have to change your
hand<00:00:51.300> much<00:00:51.480> is<00:00:51.660> always<00:00:51.899> staying<00:00:52.079> in<00:00:52.170> the<00:00:52.230> same

00:00:52.369 --> 00:00:52.379 
hand much is always staying in the same

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:55.069 
hand much is always staying in the same
basic<00:00:52.710> position<00:00:53.070> with<00:00:53.160> these<00:00:53.309> three<00:00:53.899> so<00:00:54.899> after

00:00:55.069 --> 00:00:55.079 
basic position with these three so after

00:00:55.079 --> 00:01:02.750 
basic position with these three so after
this<00:00:55.460> we<00:00:56.460> move<00:00:56.640> one<00:00:56.850> up<00:00:57.000> to<00:00:57.420> F<00:00:57.739> see<00:00:58.739> nap

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:02.760 

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:05.119 

let<00:01:03.000> me<00:01:03.090> go<00:01:03.149> all<00:01:03.269> the<00:01:03.390> way<00:01:03.420> down<00:01:03.510> to<00:01:03.719> see<00:01:04.290> G<00:01:04.799> and

00:01:05.119 --> 00:01:05.129 
let me go all the way down to see G and

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:14.899 
let me go all the way down to see G and
C<00:01:11.600> to<00:01:12.600> G

00:01:14.899 --> 00:01:14.909 

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:16.700 

and<00:01:15.390> then<00:01:15.719> we're<00:01:15.869> back<00:01:15.990> the<00:01:16.140> beginning<00:01:16.560> we've

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:16.710 
and then we're back the beginning we've

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:20.090 
and then we're back the beginning we've
won<00:01:16.890> at<00:01:16.979> war<00:01:17.990> and<00:01:18.990> when<00:01:19.229> we<00:01:19.319> restarted<00:01:19.829> so

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:20.100 
won at war and when we restarted so

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:21.739 
won at war and when we restarted so
that's<00:01:20.280> the<00:01:20.399> basic<00:01:20.670> left<00:01:20.850> hand<00:01:21.090> you<00:01:21.479> can<00:01:21.630> just

00:01:21.739 --> 00:01:21.749 
that's the basic left hand you can just

00:01:21.749 --> 00:01:23.539 
that's the basic left hand you can just
repeat<00:01:21.990> that<00:01:22.049> over<00:01:22.289> and<00:01:22.439> it<00:01:23.280> pretty<00:01:23.460> much

00:01:23.539 --> 00:01:23.549 
repeat that over and it pretty much

00:01:23.549 --> 00:01:25.999 
repeat that over and it pretty much
doesn't<00:01:23.850> change<00:01:24.119> for<00:01:24.329> the<00:01:24.390> whole<00:01:24.509> song<00:01:25.009> okay

00:01:25.999 --> 00:01:26.009 
doesn't change for the whole song okay

00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:27.410 
doesn't change for the whole song okay
so<00:01:26.069> the<00:01:26.310> right<00:01:26.460> hand<00:01:26.490> is<00:01:26.729> pretty<00:01:26.939> simple<00:01:27.179> too

00:01:27.410 --> 00:01:27.420 
so the right hand is pretty simple too

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:29.510 
so the right hand is pretty simple too
again<00:01:28.259> we're<00:01:28.409> starting<00:01:28.649> on<00:01:28.740> middle<00:01:29.039> C<00:01:29.069> here

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:29.520 
again we're starting on middle C here

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:32.109 
again we're starting on middle C here
and<00:01:29.969> we<00:01:30.060> move<00:01:30.240> up<00:01:30.420> to<00:01:30.569> G<00:01:30.840> on<00:01:31.259> top<00:01:31.590> of<00:01:31.619> that

00:01:32.109 --> 00:01:32.119 
and we move up to G on top of that

00:01:32.119 --> 00:01:35.020 
and we move up to G on top of that
that's<00:01:33.119> we're<00:01:33.450> starting<00:01:33.719> for<00:01:33.840> the<00:01:33.869> piece<00:01:34.109> so

00:01:35.020 --> 00:01:35.030 
that's we're starting for the piece so

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:37.399 
that's we're starting for the piece so
the<00:01:36.030> simplest<00:01:36.329> way<00:01:36.569> to<00:01:36.599> do<00:01:36.810> this<00:01:36.929> I<00:01:37.109> would<00:01:37.229> say

00:01:37.399 --> 00:01:37.409 
the simplest way to do this I would say

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:38.899 
the simplest way to do this I would say
is<00:01:37.530> to<00:01:37.649> listen<00:01:37.799> to<00:01:38.009> the<00:01:38.099> actual<00:01:38.340> song<00:01:38.670> your

00:01:38.899 --> 00:01:38.909 
is to listen to the actual song your

00:01:38.909 --> 00:01:40.880 
is to listen to the actual song your
actual<00:01:39.149> over<00:01:39.359> is<00:01:39.450> dead<00:01:39.659> and<00:01:39.869> just<00:01:40.590> figure<00:01:40.770> out

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:40.890 
actual over is dead and just figure out

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:42.289 
actual over is dead and just figure out
the<00:01:41.009> melody<00:01:41.399> and<00:01:41.429> be<00:01:41.640> able<00:01:41.700> to<00:01:41.819> listen<00:01:42.000> to<00:01:42.209> it

00:01:42.289 --> 00:01:42.299 
the melody and be able to listen to it

00:01:42.299 --> 00:01:43.969 
the melody and be able to listen to it
in<00:01:42.359> your<00:01:42.450> head<00:01:42.630> and<00:01:42.810> follow<00:01:43.409> along<00:01:43.590> as<00:01:43.890> you

00:01:43.969 --> 00:01:43.979 
in your head and follow along as you

00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:47.869 
in your head and follow along as you
play<00:01:44.189> so<00:01:44.939> when<00:01:45.060> I<00:01:45.149> think<00:01:45.469> that<00:01:46.469> was<00:01:46.829> strange<00:01:47.039> to

00:01:47.869 --> 00:01:47.879 
play so when I think that was strange to

00:01:47.879 --> 00:01:50.990 
play so when I think that was strange to
see<00:01:48.239> you<00:01:48.770> it's<00:01:49.770> easy<00:01:49.979> to<00:01:50.219> you<00:01:50.520> know<00:01:50.610> figure<00:01:50.819> out

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:51.000 
see you it's easy to you know figure out

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:52.219 
see you it's easy to you know figure out
where<00:01:51.119> you're<00:01:51.209> going<00:01:51.539> it<00:01:51.719> doesn't<00:01:52.110> really

00:01:52.219 --> 00:01:52.229 
where you're going it doesn't really

00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:54.260 
where you're going it doesn't really
jumped<00:01:52.530> more<00:01:52.619> than<00:01:52.679> two<00:01:53.009> at<00:01:53.729> any<00:01:53.939> point<00:01:54.060> the

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:54.270 
jumped more than two at any point the

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:57.649 
jumped more than two at any point the
song<00:01:54.479> so<00:01:55.379> if<00:01:56.189> you<00:01:56.429> just<00:01:56.969> play<00:01:57.329> it<00:01:57.360> through<00:01:57.629> a

00:01:57.649 --> 00:01:57.659 
song so if you just play it through a

00:01:57.659 --> 00:01:59.179 
song so if you just play it through a
few<00:01:57.810> times<00:01:58.020> you'll<00:01:58.469> eventually<00:01:58.590> get<00:01:58.979> it<00:01:59.159> I

00:01:59.179 --> 00:01:59.189 
few times you'll eventually get it I

00:01:59.189 --> 00:01:59.929 
few times you'll eventually get it I
don't<00:01:59.340> really<00:01:59.429> want<00:01:59.610> to<00:01:59.640> go<00:01:59.729> through<00:01:59.879> the

00:01:59.929 --> 00:01:59.939 
don't really want to go through the

00:01:59.939 --> 00:02:03.050 
don't really want to go through the
whole<00:02:00.060> piece<00:02:00.329> in<00:02:00.869> this<00:02:01.140> tutorial<00:02:02.039> but<00:02:02.549> they'll

00:02:03.050 --> 00:02:03.060 
whole piece in this tutorial but they'll

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:09.859 
whole piece in this tutorial but they'll
figure<00:02:03.209> it<00:02:03.329> out<00:02:03.509> soon<00:02:03.780> enough<00:02:03.899> so<00:02:07.700> and<00:02:08.720> the<00:02:09.720> way

00:02:09.859 --> 00:02:09.869 
figure it out soon enough so and the way

00:02:09.869 --> 00:02:11.479 
figure it out soon enough so and the way
I<00:02:09.899> played<00:02:10.259> I<00:02:10.410> sometimes<00:02:10.769> add<00:02:10.979> a<00:02:11.009> bit<00:02:11.250> of<00:02:11.280> a

00:02:11.479 --> 00:02:11.489 
I played I sometimes add a bit of a

00:02:11.489 --> 00:02:13.720 
I played I sometimes add a bit of a
chord<00:02:11.790> so<00:02:12.180> if<00:02:12.810> you<00:02:12.870> play<00:02:13.109> your<00:02:13.140> third<00:02:13.379> below

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:13.730 
chord so if you play your third below

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:16.220 
chord so if you play your third below
its<00:02:14.730> tense<00:02:15.269> it<00:02:15.420> sound<00:02:15.569> pretty<00:02:15.629> nice<00:02:15.930> and<00:02:16.170> you

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:16.230 
its tense it sound pretty nice and you

00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:17.960 
its tense it sound pretty nice and you
can<00:02:16.410> experiment<00:02:17.040> a<00:02:17.250> little<00:02:17.310> bit<00:02:17.459> and<00:02:17.700> see<00:02:17.819> what

00:02:17.960 --> 00:02:17.970 
can experiment a little bit and see what

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:30.510 
can experiment a little bit and see what
works<00:02:18.060> for<00:02:18.329> you<00:02:18.450> so

00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:30.520 

00:02:30.520 --> 00:02:33.190 

except<00:02:31.520> so<00:02:31.940> figure<00:02:32.630> out<00:02:32.750> we're<00:02:32.870> works<00:02:33.020> with

00:02:33.190 --> 00:02:33.200 
except so figure out we're works with

00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:34.510 
except so figure out we're works with
the<00:02:33.320> right<00:02:33.500> hand<00:02:33.740> and<00:02:33.950> a<00:02:33.980> tough<00:02:34.160> part<00:02:34.340> of

00:02:34.510 --> 00:02:34.520 
the right hand and a tough part of

00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:38.110 
the right hand and a tough part of
course<00:02:34.700> is<00:02:34.910> combining<00:02:35.360> the<00:02:35.570> two<00:02:35.690> of<00:02:35.810> them<00:02:37.120> okay

00:02:38.110 --> 00:02:38.120 
course is combining the two of them okay

00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:40.060 
course is combining the two of them okay
so<00:02:38.420> what<00:02:38.870> is<00:02:38.990> your<00:02:39.110> problem<00:02:39.320> start<00:02:39.710> with<00:02:39.860> is

00:02:40.060 --> 00:02:40.070 
so what is your problem start with is

00:02:40.070 --> 00:02:49.510 
so what is your problem start with is
the<00:02:40.370> left<00:02:40.580> hand<00:02:48.100> they<00:02:49.100> want<00:02:49.280> to<00:02:49.340> feel

00:02:49.510 --> 00:02:49.520 
the left hand they want to feel

00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:50.770 
the left hand they want to feel
comfortable<00:02:49.670> enough<00:02:50.120> with<00:02:50.180> that<00:02:50.330> start

00:02:50.770 --> 00:02:50.780 
comfortable enough with that start

00:02:50.780 --> 00:02:52.450 
comfortable enough with that start
adding<00:02:50.930> in<00:02:51.110> the<00:02:51.230> right<00:02:51.380> hand<00:02:51.620> if<00:02:52.010> it<00:02:52.190> helps<00:02:52.400> you

00:02:52.450 --> 00:02:52.460 
adding in the right hand if it helps you

00:02:52.460 --> 00:02:53.830 
adding in the right hand if it helps you
can<00:02:52.610> played<00:02:52.790> without<00:02:52.940> the<00:02:53.240> melody<00:02:53.540> average

00:02:53.830 --> 00:02:53.840 
can played without the melody average

00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:57.340 
can played without the melody average
just<00:02:55.209> while<00:02:56.209> you're<00:02:56.300> batting<00:02:56.630> left<00:02:56.930> hand<00:02:57.140> will

00:02:57.340 --> 00:02:57.350 
just while you're batting left hand will

00:02:57.350 --> 00:03:09.430 
just while you're batting left hand will
you<00:02:57.440> play

00:03:09.430 --> 00:03:09.440 

00:03:09.440 --> 00:03:11.500 

and<00:03:10.220> eventually<00:03:10.880> as<00:03:11.180> you<00:03:11.270> get<00:03:11.390> more

00:03:11.500 --> 00:03:11.510 
and eventually as you get more

00:03:11.510 --> 00:03:12.730 
and eventually as you get more
comfortable<00:03:11.570> playing<00:03:12.140> both<00:03:12.380> at<00:03:12.470> the<00:03:12.560> same

00:03:12.730 --> 00:03:12.740 
comfortable playing both at the same

00:03:12.740 --> 00:03:14.980 
comfortable playing both at the same
time<00:03:12.770> you<00:03:13.760> can<00:03:13.940> add<00:03:14.090> in<00:03:14.210> the<00:03:14.300> melody<00:03:14.630> and<00:03:14.780> it

00:03:14.980 --> 00:03:14.990 
time you can add in the melody and it

00:03:14.990 --> 00:03:34.730 
time you can add in the melody and it
sounds<00:03:15.200> a<00:03:15.230> little<00:03:15.410> bit<00:03:15.530> like<00:03:15.680> this

00:03:34.730 --> 00:03:34.740 

00:03:34.740 --> 00:03:37.050 

exactly<00:03:35.740> so<00:03:36.220> when<00:03:36.340> you<00:03:36.430> get<00:03:36.550> to<00:03:36.640> the<00:03:36.730> middle<00:03:36.760> of

00:03:37.050 --> 00:03:37.060 
exactly so when you get to the middle of

00:03:37.060 --> 00:03:39.630 
exactly so when you get to the middle of
it<00:03:37.210> I<00:03:37.680> try<00:03:38.680> to<00:03:38.710> play<00:03:38.980> a<00:03:39.010> little<00:03:39.190> differently

00:03:39.630 --> 00:03:39.640 
it I try to play a little differently

00:03:39.640 --> 00:03:42.660 
it I try to play a little differently
what<00:03:40.000> I<00:03:40.030> do<00:03:40.150> is<00:03:40.300> this<00:03:41.250> so<00:03:42.250> when<00:03:42.370> you<00:03:42.460> read<00:03:42.580> the

00:03:42.660 --> 00:03:42.670 
what I do is this so when you read the

00:03:42.670 --> 00:03:44.520 
what I do is this so when you read the
breakdown<00:03:43.060> you<00:03:43.210> can<00:03:43.300> play<00:03:43.450> this<00:03:43.600> nice<00:03:43.870> set<00:03:44.500> of

00:03:44.520 --> 00:03:44.530 
breakdown you can play this nice set of

00:03:44.530 --> 00:03:45.960 
breakdown you can play this nice set of
descending<00:03:45.070> chords<00:03:45.310> it<00:03:45.490> goes<00:03:45.640> something<00:03:45.820> like

00:03:45.960 --> 00:03:45.970 
descending chords it goes something like

00:03:45.970 --> 00:04:07.570 
descending chords it goes something like
this

00:04:07.570 --> 00:04:07.580 

00:04:07.580 --> 00:04:09.890 

it's<00:04:08.580> pretty<00:04:08.880> simple<00:04:09.120> actually<00:04:09.360> even<00:04:09.810> though

00:04:09.890 --> 00:04:09.900 
it's pretty simple actually even though

00:04:09.900 --> 00:04:11.480 
it's pretty simple actually even though
it<00:04:10.020> seems<00:04:10.200> kind<00:04:10.440> of<00:04:10.500> complicated<00:04:10.980> compared<00:04:11.430> to

00:04:11.480 --> 00:04:11.490 
it seems kind of complicated compared to

00:04:11.490 --> 00:04:15.190 
it seems kind of complicated compared to
the<00:04:11.580> rest<00:04:11.760> of<00:04:11.880> the<00:04:12.000> song<00:04:12.210> all<00:04:12.630> you<00:04:12.810> have<00:04:12.930> to<00:04:13.050> do

00:04:15.190 --> 00:04:15.200 
the rest of the song all you have to do

00:04:15.200 --> 00:04:18.199 
the rest of the song all you have to do
send<00:04:16.200> one<00:04:16.350> key<00:04:16.560> at<00:04:16.650> a<00:04:16.709> time<00:04:17.060> playing<00:04:18.060> your

00:04:18.199 --> 00:04:18.209 
send one key at a time playing your

00:04:18.209 --> 00:04:23.740 
send one key at a time playing your
octaves<00:04:20.299> skip<00:04:21.299> over<00:04:21.480> a<00:04:21.720> and<00:04:21.750> E<00:04:21.989> flat<00:04:22.340> down<00:04:23.340> to<00:04:23.520> D

00:04:23.740 --> 00:04:23.750 
octaves skip over a and E flat down to D

00:04:23.750 --> 00:04:26.570 
octaves skip over a and E flat down to D
and<00:04:24.750> then<00:04:24.900> see<00:04:25.200> so<00:04:25.980> when<00:04:26.130> you<00:04:26.220> play<00:04:26.400> it<00:04:26.490> with

00:04:26.570 --> 00:04:26.580 
and then see so when you play it with

00:04:26.580 --> 00:04:39.320 
and then see so when you play it with
the<00:04:26.670> rest<00:04:27.110> sounds<00:04:28.110> like<00:04:28.320> this

00:04:39.320 --> 00:04:39.330 

00:04:39.330 --> 00:04:42.120 

and<00:04:40.330> that's<00:04:41.080> pretty<00:04:41.260> much<00:04:41.380> the<00:04:41.530> basics<00:04:42.010> of<00:04:42.070> how

00:04:42.120 --> 00:04:42.130 
and that's pretty much the basics of how

00:04:42.130 --> 00:04:43.950 
and that's pretty much the basics of how
to<00:04:42.220> play<00:04:42.490> your<00:04:42.700> ex-lover<00:04:43.060> is<00:04:43.240> dead<00:04:43.270> by<00:04:43.630> stars

00:04:43.950 --> 00:04:43.960 
to play your ex-lover is dead by stars

00:04:43.960 --> 00:04:45.990 
to play your ex-lover is dead by stars
