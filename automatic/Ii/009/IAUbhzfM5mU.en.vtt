00:00:00.749 --> 00:00:04.160

 in those matches where the second of a series of three in the battle for it 

00:00:18.869 --> 00:00:20.699
 wk 

00:00:20.699 --> 00:00:23.699
 this job is also none of the spectacle with the 

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:25.230
 was on the draw 

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:26.769
 the name says it a bit 

00:00:26.769 --> 00:00:29.009
 even the prettiest are almost as small 

00:00:29.009 --> 00:00:31.809

00:00:31.809 --> 00:00:35.269
 at the park is primarily meant for young drivers as a stepping stone to the 

00:00:35.269 --> 00:00:36.770
 real motorsport 

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:41.980
 that is why this 17-year-old Benno van Passes is one of the oldest 

00:00:41.980 --> 00:00:45.480
 Participants often on the Saturday he was fourth but it did not go completely 

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:46.740
 perfect 

00:00:46.740 --> 00:00:50.200
 so just before the second game, he is still busy with the final preparations 

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:53.770
 I received a time penalty yesterday 

00:00:53.770 --> 00:00:56.770
 had the benefit of the front door of his visit 

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:01.320
 we make you turn your ship on a car that stays away 

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:06.960
 it seems like melvin damsma maintained signpost 

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:08.840

 He will definitely cross the road today 

00:01:56.650 --> 00:01:58.650
 Willem van Hanegem fourth behind a man 

00:01:58.650 --> 00:02:01.860
 in the suit of arjen blue, about three-quarters of the race in third 

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:06.060
 position moderate due to some push and pull that loses its podium place 

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:07.490
 artistry seventh 

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:11.290
 because he again gets penalty seconds because of foot that is not on a piece 

00:02:11.290 --> 00:02:15.110
 satire temporarily moved to ninth place it was a hectic race 

00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:16.730

00:02:16.730 --> 00:02:18.729
 what was definitely one 

00:02:18.729 --> 00:02:22.369

 but we want to stay we are scared 

00:02:28.499 --> 00:02:32.099
 because the Italian style dominates in this sport 

00:02:32.099 --> 00:02:34.589

00:03:05.499 --> 00:03:08.899
 it is just a contemporary debate, she also continues 

00:03:08.899 --> 00:03:10.919
