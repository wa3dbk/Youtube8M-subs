 according to the developer the decision not 

00:00:55.920 --> 00:01:00.359
 has nothing to do with the recent exit of 

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:02.340
 your co - workers and to close the 

00:01:00.359 --> 00:01:03.000

 good plain while sony is 

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:20.610
 Losing employees on facebook has 

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:22.500
 some good new employees 

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:24.540
 interesting among them john carmack 

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:27.090
 because the social network decided to 

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:29.369
 buy this week the glasses to 

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:31.799
 developer of the vitti glasses and paid 

00:01:29.369 --> 00:01:34.530
 in it 2 billion dollars what not more 

00:01:31.799 --> 00:01:36.750
 or less 4.5 billion reais 

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:38.490
 well I'll let you go and say more 

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:40.439
 do not think because our focus here is 

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:41.790
 and this decision has already had its 

00:01:40.439 --> 00:01:44.399
 first great impact 

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:46.380
 markus persson creator of minecraft and 

00:01:44.399 --> 00:01:48.270
 take the game to the rift glasses but 

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:51.119
 decided to skip out because facebook 

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:53.220
 according to he himself scares him 

00:01:51.119 --> 00:01:55.470
 have explained that the people behind 

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:57.840
 of the social network are not 

00:01:55.470 --> 00:01:59.640
 technology and has its policy 

00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:00.479
 only to generate the greatest number of 

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:02.520
 users 

00:02:00.479 --> 00:02:04.380
 and this is not the focus of the developer who 

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:06.270
 wants to work only with games 

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:08.789
 in any case the creator of the largest 

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:10.080
 The world's toast still believes in 

00:02:08.789 --> 00:02:13.500
 virtual reality and 

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:15.390
 optimistic with technology five million 

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:17.610
 and a half people have seen the 

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:19.530
 documentary free to play created by 

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:21.840
 valve that accompanies the day-to-day 

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:24.600
 three professional players from the 

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:26.040
 developer mode the players are 

00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:28.170
 different countries in different 

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:30.660
 continents then the documentary shows 

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:33.330
 the day and different days of each but 

00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:35.250
 like the common passion that is the sport 

00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:37.200
 for whoever is interested the video 

00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:39.150
 is available in full on youtube 

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:41.400
 besides being able to be downloaded by the esteem 

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:43.770
 all with subtitles in brazilian portuguese 

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:45.030
 And speaking Navarro, the developer is 

00:02:43.770 --> 00:02:47.880
 leading his most famous Brazilian 

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:49.350
 portal for android but no use to 

00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:51.150
 people pulling smartphone in their pocket 

00:02:49.350 --> 00:02:53.160
 because the game will be cut 

00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:54.540
 exclusively on the child's console 

00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:56.160
 nvidia laptop 

00:02:54.540 --> 00:02:58.620
 who wants to see the full video of 

00:02:56.160 --> 00:03:01.590
 gameplay of the game in the console is only access 

00:02:58.620 --> 00:03:03.540
 the news link down here once 

00:03:01.590 --> 00:03:05.970
 It is very interesting for those who have or who 

00:03:03.540 --> 00:03:08.400
 think about buying a ps 4 to be hashish 

00:03:05.970 --> 00:03:11.100
 twitter famous for leaking information from 

00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:13.170
 games reported that the console will win 

00:03:11.100 --> 00:03:15.989
 support for classic ps one games 

00:03:13.170 --> 00:03:19.230
 year and ps2 some running even in 

00:03:15.989 --> 00:03:22.019
 80 t the information probably comes from 

00:03:19.230 --> 00:03:23.730
 conversations that hashish stopped at gdc then 

00:03:22.019 --> 00:03:25.470
 It's good to be careful because 

00:03:23.730 --> 00:03:27.209
 they are not confirmed at all 

00:03:25.470 --> 00:03:28.830
 anyway the whole time has a 

00:03:27.209 --> 00:03:29.700
 good history of accepting this kind of 

00:03:28.830 --> 00:03:32.700
 leakage 

00:03:29.700 --> 00:03:34.860
 bethesda announced this week

 Special Edition does not come with the game

 developer explained that as the 

00:03:58.920 --> 00:04:03.030
 package is too big your shipment is more 

00:04:00.870 --> 00:04:05.280
