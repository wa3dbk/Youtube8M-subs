that<00:00:09.540> you<00:00:09.750> may<00:00:09.870> have<00:00:10.019> just<00:00:11.010> based<00:00:11.219> off<00:00:11.400> of<00:00:11.429> a

00:00:11.839 --> 00:00:11.849 
that you may have just based off of a

00:00:11.849 --> 00:00:14.509 
that you may have just based off of a
curve<00:00:12.269> of<00:00:12.599> the<00:00:13.080> exterior<00:00:13.440> of<00:00:13.620> the<00:00:13.769> room<00:00:13.980> so

00:00:14.509 --> 00:00:14.519 
curve of the exterior of the room so

00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:16.599 
curve of the exterior of the room so
this<00:00:14.639> could<00:00:14.759> be<00:00:14.820> a<00:00:14.849> closed<00:00:15.089> polyline<00:00:15.630> or

00:00:16.599 --> 00:00:16.609 
this could be a closed polyline or

00:00:16.609 --> 00:00:19.460 
this could be a closed polyline or
anything<00:00:17.609> that<00:00:17.760> you<00:00:17.940> have<00:00:18.080> so<00:00:19.080> here's<00:00:19.320> the

00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:19.470 
anything that you have so here's the

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:21.800 
anything that you have so here's the
finished<00:00:19.590> product<00:00:20.130> and<00:00:20.279> you<00:00:20.520> can<00:00:20.670> see<00:00:20.910> that<00:00:21.119> we

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:21.810 
finished product and you can see that we

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:25.700 
finished product and you can see that we
will<00:00:22.619> be<00:00:22.800> changing<00:00:23.160> the<00:00:24.109> framing<00:00:25.109> dimension

00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:25.710 
will be changing the framing dimension

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:28.730 
will be changing the framing dimension
on<00:00:26.220> ciner<00:00:26.750> however<00:00:27.750> many<00:00:27.990> inches<00:00:28.289> on<00:00:28.439> Center

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:28.740 
on ciner however many inches on Center

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:32.450 
on ciner however many inches on Center
will<00:00:29.250> frame<00:00:29.490> it<00:00:29.519> out<00:00:29.760> the<00:00:31.279> cross-section<00:00:32.279> of

00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:32.460 
will frame it out the cross-section of

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:36.080 
will frame it out the cross-section of
the<00:00:32.790> members<00:00:33.600> for<00:00:33.899> this<00:00:33.989> 2x4<00:00:34.559> or<00:00:34.590> 2x6<00:00:34.860> and<00:00:35.489> then

00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:36.090 
the members for this 2x4 or 2x6 and then

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:39.590 
the members for this 2x4 or 2x6 and then
the<00:00:36.210> height<00:00:36.390> of<00:00:36.630> the<00:00:36.989> studs<00:00:37.260> so<00:00:37.829> whatever<00:00:38.610> the

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:39.600 
the height of the studs so whatever the

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:42.500 
the height of the studs so whatever the
height<00:00:39.809> may<00:00:40.230> be<00:00:40.440> and<00:00:41.030> here's<00:00:42.030> the<00:00:42.120> finished

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:42.510 
height may be and here's the finished

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:46.369 
height may be and here's the finished
project<00:00:42.809> we'll<00:00:43.590> just<00:00:44.070> delete<00:00:44.430> that<00:00:44.610> and<00:00:45.379> pop

00:00:46.369 --> 00:00:46.379 
project we'll just delete that and pop

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:53.119 
project we'll just delete that and pop
up<00:00:46.620> grasshopper<00:00:51.379> so<00:00:52.379> here<00:00:52.530> you<00:00:52.649> can<00:00:52.739> see<00:00:52.949> in

00:00:53.119 --> 00:00:53.129 
up grasshopper so here you can see in

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:55.729 
up grasshopper so here you can see in
grasshopper<00:00:53.930> it's<00:00:54.930> not<00:00:55.140> a<00:00:55.410> very<00:00:55.680> big

00:00:55.729 --> 00:00:55.739

define it I'll go ahead and delete the

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:10.280 
define it I'll go ahead and delete the
the<00:01:05.640> meat<00:01:05.850> of<00:01:06.060> this<00:01:06.560> definition<00:01:07.560> and<00:01:09.229> show<00:01:10.229> you

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:10.290 
the meat of this definition and show you

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:12.230 
the meat of this definition and show you
the<00:01:10.500> the<00:01:10.860> sliders<00:01:11.280> that<00:01:11.310> I'm<00:01:11.520> going<00:01:11.970> to<00:01:12.030> keep

00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:12.240 
the the sliders that I'm going to keep

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:18.289 
the the sliders that I'm going to keep
on<00:01:13.460> center<00:01:14.460> the<00:01:14.700> framing<00:01:15.740> in<00:01:16.740> inches<00:01:17.299> the

00:01:18.289 --> 00:01:18.299 
on center the framing in inches the

00:01:18.299 --> 00:01:19.910 
on center the framing in inches the
width<00:01:18.570> and<00:01:18.750> the<00:01:18.810> length<00:01:18.840> or<00:01:19.320> the<00:01:19.439> effective

00:01:19.910 --> 00:01:19.920 
width and the length or the effective

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:21.649 
width and the length or the effective
cross<00:01:20.130> section<00:01:20.549> of<00:01:20.640> the<00:01:20.790> stud<00:01:21.030> and<00:01:21.240> then<00:01:21.509> all

00:01:21.649 --> 00:01:21.659 
cross section of the stud and then all

00:01:21.659 --> 00:01:23.570 
cross section of the stud and then all
of<00:01:21.689> these<00:01:21.869> are<00:01:22.049> in<00:01:22.170> inches<00:01:22.530> so<00:01:22.740> we'll<00:01:22.950> divide

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:23.580 
of these are in inches so we'll divide

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:27.289 
of these are in inches so we'll divide
that<00:01:23.820> by<00:01:24.180> 12<00:01:24.570> with<00:01:25.020> a<00:01:25.049> function<00:01:25.759> f<00:01:26.759> 1<00:01:27.030> function

00:01:27.289 --> 00:01:27.299 
that by 12 with a function f 1 function

00:01:27.299 --> 00:01:30.530 
that by 12 with a function f 1 function
to<00:01:28.070> reduce<00:01:29.070> that<00:01:29.220> for<00:01:29.490> feet<00:01:29.700> and<00:01:29.939> in<00:01:30.509> the

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:30.540 
to reduce that for feet and in the

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:32.120 
to reduce that for feet and in the
height<00:01:30.780> of<00:01:30.810> the<00:01:31.049> stud<00:01:31.290> which<00:01:31.500> we<00:01:31.650> can<00:01:31.799> keep<00:01:31.950> in

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:32.130 
height of the stud which we can keep in

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:36.590 
height of the stud which we can keep in
feet<00:01:32.400> will<00:01:33.030> say<00:01:33.240> is<00:01:33.509> 12<00:01:34.229> feet<00:01:35.299> so<00:01:36.299> here's<00:01:36.479> the

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:36.600 
feet will say is 12 feet so here's the

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:39.590 
feet will say is 12 feet so here's the
curve<00:01:36.840> I'll<00:01:37.140> set<00:01:37.380> one<00:01:37.409> curve<00:01:37.770> as<00:01:38.329> this<00:01:39.329> curve

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:39.600 
curve I'll set one curve as this curve

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:41.960 
curve I'll set one curve as this curve
it's<00:01:39.780> already<00:01:39.990> set<00:01:40.520> the<00:01:41.520> first<00:01:41.729> thing<00:01:41.939> that

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:41.970 
it's already set the first thing that

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:44.120 
it's already set the first thing that
we're<00:01:42.180> gonna<00:01:42.270> want<00:01:42.479> to<00:01:42.570> do<00:01:42.689> is<00:01:42.930> offset<00:01:43.470> this

00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:44.130 
we're gonna want to do is offset this

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:45.950 
we're gonna want to do is offset this
offset<00:01:45.000> it<00:01:45.180> so<00:01:45.360> that's<00:01:45.509> under<00:01:45.630> curve

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:45.960 
offset it so that's under curve

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:51.560 
offset it so that's under curve
utilities<00:01:47.240> offset<00:01:48.350> by<00:01:49.350> length<00:01:50.390> take<00:01:51.390> that

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:51.570 
utilities offset by length take that

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:58.249 
utilities offset by length take that
curve<00:01:51.869> and<00:01:52.170> then<00:01:52.500> the<00:01:54.229> distance<00:01:56.299> offset<00:01:57.299> will

00:01:58.249 --> 00:01:58.259 
curve and then the distance offset will

00:01:58.259 --> 00:02:02.499 
curve and then the distance offset will
use<00:01:58.560> the<00:01:58.829> length<00:01:59.280> of<00:02:00.090> the<00:02:00.270> stud<00:02:00.509> or<00:02:00.540> the<00:02:01.130> the

00:02:02.499 --> 00:02:02.509 
use the length of the stud or the the

00:02:02.509 --> 00:02:05.030 
use the length of the stud or the the
larger<00:02:03.509> dimension<00:02:04.079> because<00:02:04.619> that's<00:02:04.770> going<00:02:04.979> to

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:05.040 
larger dimension because that's going to

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:09.669 
larger dimension because that's going to
be<00:02:05.130> effectively<00:02:05.549> the<00:02:05.790> the<00:02:06.060> base<00:02:06.210> plate<00:02:06.540> and

00:02:09.669 --> 00:02:09.679 

00:02:09.679 --> 00:02:14.970 

if<00:02:09.859> you<00:02:10.810> need<00:02:11.810> to<00:02:12.019> you<00:02:12.319> can<00:02:12.560> inverse<00:02:13.189> this<00:02:13.819> by

00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:14.980 
if you need to you can inverse this by

00:02:14.980 --> 00:02:19.420 
if you need to you can inverse this by
doing<00:02:15.980> negative<00:02:16.730> of<00:02:17.030> x<00:02:17.209> over<00:02:17.480> 12<00:02:17.930> or<00:02:18.249> I'm<00:02:19.249> sorry

00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:19.430 
doing negative of x over 12 or I'm sorry

00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:21.339 
doing negative of x over 12 or I'm sorry
running<00:02:20.060> through<00:02:20.180> a<00:02:20.269> different<00:02:20.810> function<00:02:20.959> on

00:02:21.339 --> 00:02:21.349 
running through a different function on

00:02:21.349 --> 00:02:26.920 
running through a different function on
negative<00:02:21.859> 1x<00:02:22.510> so<00:02:23.510> it<00:02:24.049> will<00:02:24.439> switch<00:02:25.400> the<00:02:25.930> switch

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:26.930 
negative 1x so it will switch the switch

00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:30.670 
negative 1x so it will switch the switch
to<00:02:27.139> the<00:02:27.230> offset<00:02:27.920> to<00:02:28.040> the<00:02:28.129> outside<00:02:28.579> if<00:02:29.680> that

00:02:30.670 --> 00:02:30.680 
to the offset to the outside if that

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:34.209 
to the offset to the outside if that
matters<00:02:31.129> for<00:02:31.159> what<00:02:31.430> you're<00:02:31.549> doing<00:02:31.790> and<00:02:33.219> after

00:02:34.209 --> 00:02:34.219 
matters for what you're doing and after

00:02:34.219 --> 00:02:41.099 
matters for what you're doing and after
we<00:02:34.549> do<00:02:35.030> the<00:02:35.150> offset<00:02:35.629> we<00:02:36.439> can<00:02:38.980> divide<00:02:39.980> the<00:02:40.189> curve

00:02:41.099 --> 00:02:41.109 
we do the offset we can divide the curve

00:02:41.109 --> 00:02:45.690 
we do the offset we can divide the curve
so<00:02:42.109> we'll<00:02:42.260> go<00:02:42.319> under<00:02:42.439> curve<00:02:42.739> division<00:02:44.409> length

00:02:45.690 --> 00:02:45.700 
so we'll go under curve division length

00:02:45.700 --> 00:02:51.670 
so we'll go under curve division length
and<00:02:47.290> that<00:02:48.290> will<00:02:48.699> ask<00:02:49.699> for<00:02:50.090> a<00:02:50.150> curve<00:02:50.480> our<00:02:51.019> offset

00:02:51.670 --> 00:02:51.680 
and that will ask for a curve our offset

00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:54.610 
and that will ask for a curve our offset
will<00:02:51.949> define<00:02:52.400> and<00:02:52.669> then<00:02:53.359> the<00:02:53.930> length<00:02:54.379> that<00:02:54.500> we

00:02:54.610 --> 00:02:54.620 
will define and then the length that we

00:02:54.620 --> 00:02:57.189 
will define and then the length that we
want<00:02:54.769> to<00:02:54.829> divide<00:02:55.069> it<00:02:55.099> in<00:02:55.370> so<00:02:56.090> we'll<00:02:56.449> send<00:02:57.049> that

00:02:57.189 --> 00:02:57.199 
want to divide it in so we'll send that

00:02:57.199 --> 00:03:05.170 
want to divide it in so we'll send that
back<00:02:57.379> to<00:02:57.620> the<00:02:58.250> on<00:02:58.939> center<00:03:02.709> slider<00:03:03.790> so<00:03:04.790> however

00:03:05.170 --> 00:03:05.180 
back to the on center slider so however

00:03:05.180 --> 00:03:06.939 
back to the on center slider so however
many<00:03:05.540> inches<00:03:05.900> on<00:03:06.049> center<00:03:06.349> you<00:03:06.469> want<00:03:06.620> it<00:03:06.709> to<00:03:06.829> be

00:03:06.939 --> 00:03:06.949 
many inches on center you want it to be

00:03:06.949 --> 00:03:09.119 
many inches on center you want it to be
divided<00:03:07.219> that<00:03:07.400> that's<00:03:07.909> what<00:03:08.120> it'll<00:03:08.329> be<00:03:08.510> and

00:03:09.119 --> 00:03:09.129 
divided that that's what it'll be and

00:03:09.129 --> 00:03:12.759 
divided that that's what it'll be and
that's<00:03:10.129> it<00:03:10.400> for<00:03:10.609> the<00:03:10.730> division<00:03:11.560> the<00:03:12.560> next

00:03:12.759 --> 00:03:12.769 
that's it for the division the next

00:03:12.769 --> 00:03:16.749 
that's it for the division the next
thing<00:03:12.919> we<00:03:13.010> want<00:03:13.040> to<00:03:13.219> do<00:03:13.340> for<00:03:14.150> the<00:03:14.329> the<00:03:15.259> studs<00:03:15.769> it

00:03:16.749 --> 00:03:16.759 
thing we want to do for the the studs it

00:03:16.759 --> 00:03:18.789 
thing we want to do for the the studs it
is<00:03:17.030> going<00:03:17.269> to<00:03:17.389> be<00:03:17.479> a<00:03:17.509> base<00:03:17.870> plane<00:03:18.259> so<00:03:18.769> that

00:03:18.789 --> 00:03:18.799 
is going to be a base plane so that

00:03:18.799 --> 00:03:20.640 
is going to be a base plane so that
those<00:03:19.129> are<00:03:19.220> gonna<00:03:19.340> be<00:03:19.400> horizontal<00:03:19.970> frames

00:03:20.640 --> 00:03:20.650 
those are gonna be horizontal frames

00:03:20.650 --> 00:03:23.580 
those are gonna be horizontal frames
just<00:03:21.650> double<00:03:21.889> click<00:03:22.069> and<00:03:22.250> find<00:03:22.400> frames<00:03:22.879> and

00:03:23.580 --> 00:03:23.590 
just double click and find frames and

00:03:23.590 --> 00:03:26.559 
just double click and find frames and
that'll<00:03:24.590> be<00:03:24.680> a<00:03:24.709> horizontal<00:03:25.040> frames<00:03:25.549> so<00:03:26.449> that

00:03:26.559 --> 00:03:26.569 
that'll be a horizontal frames so that

00:03:26.569 --> 00:03:28.449 
that'll be a horizontal frames so that
asks<00:03:26.750> for<00:03:26.780> a<00:03:26.930> curve<00:03:27.379> to<00:03:27.709> put<00:03:27.889> the<00:03:27.979> frames<00:03:28.220> on

00:03:28.449 --> 00:03:28.459 
asks for a curve to put the frames on

00:03:28.459 --> 00:03:32.559 
asks for a curve to put the frames on
and<00:03:28.669> then<00:03:29.599> the<00:03:29.900> number<00:03:30.199> of<00:03:30.319> frames<00:03:31.180> we<00:03:32.180> want<00:03:32.419> to

00:03:32.559 --> 00:03:32.569 
and then the number of frames we want to

00:03:32.569 --> 00:03:34.179 
and then the number of frames we want to
correspond<00:03:33.049> to<00:03:33.109> the<00:03:33.259> number<00:03:33.560> of<00:03:33.680> divisions

00:03:34.179 --> 00:03:34.189 
correspond to the number of divisions

00:03:34.189 --> 00:03:36.189 
correspond to the number of divisions
and<00:03:34.519> since<00:03:35.479> we<00:03:35.569> don't<00:03:35.689> know<00:03:35.840> the<00:03:35.959> number<00:03:36.169> of

00:03:36.189 --> 00:03:36.199 
and since we don't know the number of

00:03:36.199 --> 00:03:38.589 
and since we don't know the number of
divisions<00:03:36.699> they're<00:03:37.699> just<00:03:37.939> given<00:03:38.209> to<00:03:38.299> us<00:03:38.419> in

00:03:38.589 --> 00:03:38.599 
divisions they're just given to us in

00:03:38.599 --> 00:03:42.580 
divisions they're just given to us in
points<00:03:39.019> under<00:03:39.259> P<00:03:39.470> will<00:03:39.889> go<00:03:40.069> under<00:03:41.109> logic<00:03:42.109> list

00:03:42.580 --> 00:03:42.590 
points under P will go under logic list

00:03:42.590 --> 00:03:44.860 
points under P will go under logic list
and<00:03:42.949> then<00:03:43.549> list<00:03:43.879> lengths<00:03:44.150> and<00:03:44.419> find<00:03:44.720> the

00:03:44.860 --> 00:03:44.870 
and then list lengths and find the

00:03:44.870 --> 00:03:48.939 
and then list lengths and find the
length<00:03:45.409> of<00:03:45.680> the<00:03:46.669> points<00:03:47.569> list<00:03:47.840> so<00:03:48.739> that<00:03:48.769> I'll

00:03:48.939 --> 00:03:48.949 
length of the points list so that I'll

00:03:48.949 --> 00:03:51.339 
length of the points list so that I'll
give<00:03:49.069> us<00:03:49.189> a<00:03:49.280> number<00:03:49.609> and<00:03:49.819> then<00:03:50.689> we'll<00:03:50.870> feed

00:03:51.339 --> 00:03:51.349 
give us a number and then we'll feed

00:03:51.349 --> 00:03:54.399 
give us a number and then we'll feed
that<00:03:51.470> number<00:03:51.769> into<00:03:51.949> the<00:03:52.159> N<00:03:52.900> so<00:03:53.900> this<00:03:54.049> way<00:03:54.199> when

00:03:54.399 --> 00:03:54.409 
that number into the N so this way when

00:03:54.409 --> 00:03:59.439 
that number into the N so this way when
we<00:03:54.439> go<00:03:54.680> back<00:03:54.919> to<00:03:56.919> however<00:03:57.919> many<00:03:58.189> on<00:03:58.459> Center<00:03:58.939> we

00:03:59.439 --> 00:03:59.449 
we go back to however many on Center we

00:03:59.449 --> 00:04:00.270 
we go back to however many on Center we
want

00:04:00.270 --> 00:04:00.280 
want

00:04:00.280 --> 00:04:06.759 
want
it'll<00:04:01.900> correspond<00:04:03.400> equally<00:04:04.400> with<00:04:04.609> that<00:04:05.769> and

00:04:06.759 --> 00:04:06.769 
it'll correspond equally with that and

00:04:06.769 --> 00:04:09.309 
it'll correspond equally with that and
then<00:04:06.919> from<00:04:07.099> there<00:04:07.539> all<00:04:08.539> we<00:04:08.750> have<00:04:08.900> to<00:04:09.019> do<00:04:09.139> is

00:04:09.309 --> 00:04:09.319 
then from there all we have to do is

00:04:09.319 --> 00:04:12.270 
then from there all we have to do is
create<00:04:09.829> the<00:04:10.039> studs<00:04:10.340> so<00:04:10.810> we'll<00:04:11.810> go<00:04:11.959> under

00:04:12.270 --> 00:04:12.280 
create the studs so we'll go under

00:04:12.280 --> 00:04:18.519 
create the studs so we'll go under
surface<00:04:13.989> primitive<00:04:15.130> interval<00:04:16.130> box<00:04:16.400> and<00:04:17.529> the

00:04:18.519 --> 00:04:18.529 
surface primitive interval box and the

00:04:18.529 --> 00:04:20.920 
surface primitive interval box and the
interval<00:04:18.889> box<00:04:19.099> is<00:04:19.310> defined<00:04:19.639> by<00:04:19.789> B<00:04:20.419> the<00:04:20.750> base

00:04:20.920 --> 00:04:20.930 
interval box is defined by B the base

00:04:20.930 --> 00:04:22.009 
interval box is defined by B the base
plane<00:04:21.289> which<00:04:21.620> will

00:04:22.009 --> 00:04:22.019 
plane which will

00:04:22.019 --> 00:04:25.219 
plane which will
throw<00:04:22.199> into<00:04:22.410> our<00:04:22.530> frames<00:04:22.919> the<00:04:23.340> F<00:04:23.550> and<00:04:23.940> then<00:04:24.660> XY

00:04:25.219 --> 00:04:25.229 
throw into our frames the F and then XY

00:04:25.229 --> 00:04:28.159 
throw into our frames the F and then XY
and<00:04:25.410> Z<00:04:25.650> dimensions<00:04:26.639> so<00:04:27.539> I'll<00:04:27.660> scroll<00:04:27.960> out<00:04:28.139> a

00:04:28.159 --> 00:04:28.169 
and Z dimensions so I'll scroll out a

00:04:28.169 --> 00:04:31.159 
and Z dimensions so I'll scroll out a
little<00:04:28.349> bit<00:04:28.530> here<00:04:28.740> and<00:04:28.919> take<00:04:29.220> the<00:04:29.460> X<00:04:29.900> back<00:04:30.900> to

00:04:31.159 --> 00:04:31.169 
little bit here and take the X back to

00:04:31.169 --> 00:04:36.950 
little bit here and take the X back to
the<00:04:32.690> r2<00:04:34.430> dimension<00:04:35.430> the<00:04:36.210> width<00:04:36.509> of<00:04:36.629> the<00:04:36.720> stud

00:04:36.950 --> 00:04:36.960 
the r2 dimension the width of the stud

00:04:36.960 --> 00:04:41.300 
the r2 dimension the width of the stud
the<00:04:37.650> Y<00:04:37.860> can<00:04:38.250> go<00:04:38.400> back<00:04:38.639> to<00:04:38.879> the<00:04:39.949> four<00:04:40.949> inch

00:04:41.300 --> 00:04:41.310 
the Y can go back to the four inch

00:04:41.310 --> 00:04:43.129 
the Y can go back to the four inch
dimension<00:04:41.580> the<00:04:42.120> length<00:04:42.449> of<00:04:42.629> the<00:04:42.690> stud<00:04:42.930> and

00:04:43.129 --> 00:04:43.139 
dimension the length of the stud and

00:04:43.139 --> 00:04:47.740 
dimension the length of the stud and
then<00:04:43.860> Z<00:04:44.220> will<00:04:44.940> feed<00:04:45.210> back<00:04:45.240> to<00:04:45.479> our<00:04:45.900> height<00:04:46.199> and

00:04:47.740 --> 00:04:47.750 
then Z will feed back to our height and

00:04:47.750 --> 00:04:53.990 
then Z will feed back to our height and
that's<00:04:48.750> it<00:04:50.120> now<00:04:51.120> we<00:04:51.180> have<00:04:52.340> the<00:04:53.340> individual

00:04:53.990 --> 00:04:54.000 
that's it now we have the individual

00:04:54.000 --> 00:05:04.820 
that's it now we have the individual
studs<00:04:54.300> and<00:04:55.110> we<00:04:56.039> can<00:04:56.419> control<00:04:57.419> the<00:05:01.880> the<00:05:03.830> the

00:05:04.820 --> 00:05:04.830 
studs and we can control the the the

00:05:04.830 --> 00:05:07.430 
studs and we can control the the the
height<00:05:05.039> of<00:05:05.220> the<00:05:05.370> studs<00:05:05.639> the<00:05:06.599> cross-section

00:05:07.430 --> 00:05:07.440 
height of the studs the cross-section

00:05:07.440 --> 00:05:15.610 
height of the studs the cross-section
which<00:05:07.979> is<00:05:08.190> the<00:05:08.400> two<00:05:08.789> by<00:05:08.940> four<00:05:11.539> inches<00:05:12.539> and<00:05:13.520> the

which is the two by four inches and the

00:05:15.620 --> 00:05:20.899 
which is the two by four inches and the
the<00:05:17.690> the<00:05:18.690> two<00:05:18.840> by<00:05:19.020> four<00:05:19.620> cross<00:05:20.370> section<00:05:20.759> and

00:05:20.899 --> 00:05:20.909 
the the two by four cross section and

00:05:20.909 --> 00:05:26.330 
the the two by four cross section and
then<00:05:21.360> however<00:05:21.840> many<00:05:22.080> on<00:05:22.500> Center<00:05:22.949> we<00:05:23.190> want<00:05:25.280> so<00:05:26.280> I

00:05:26.330 --> 00:05:26.340 
then however many on Center we want so I

00:05:26.340 --> 00:05:28.909 
then however many on Center we want so I
would<00:05:26.909> recommend<00:05:27.389> going<00:05:27.509> back<00:05:27.780> and<00:05:28.050> putting

00:05:28.909 --> 00:05:28.919 
would recommend going back and putting

00:05:28.919 --> 00:05:36.680 
would recommend going back and putting
in<00:05:29.130> a<00:05:31.069> another<00:05:32.449> function<00:05:33.449> in<00:05:33.659> here<00:05:34.469> to<00:05:35.690> offset

00:05:36.680 --> 00:05:36.690 
in a another function in here to offset

00:05:36.690 --> 00:05:39.379 
in a another function in here to offset
this<00:05:36.840> on<00:05:37.020> the<00:05:37.139> outside<00:05:37.940> we<00:05:38.940> can<00:05:39.060> do<00:05:39.180> that<00:05:39.300> right

00:05:39.379 --> 00:05:39.389 
this on the outside we can do that right

00:05:39.389 --> 00:05:43.820 
this on the outside we can do that right
now<00:05:39.539> and<00:05:39.840> that's<00:05:40.440> just<00:05:41.419> going<00:05:42.419> to<00:05:42.539> be<00:05:42.830> negative

00:05:43.820 --> 00:05:43.830 
now and that's just going to be negative

00:05:43.830 --> 00:05:47.360 
now and that's just going to be negative
one<00:05:44.060> so<00:05:45.060> it'll<00:05:45.750> keep<00:05:45.930> the<00:05:46.110> interior<00:05:46.590> curve<00:05:46.979> the

00:05:47.360 --> 00:05:47.370 
one so it'll keep the interior curve the

00:05:47.370 --> 00:05:49.580 
one so it'll keep the interior curve the
the<00:05:47.669> same<00:05:47.909> and<00:05:48.479> that<00:05:48.750> would<00:05:48.840> be<00:05:48.930> negative<00:05:49.229> one

00:05:49.580 --> 00:05:49.590 
the same and that would be negative one

00:05:49.590 --> 00:05:56.379 
the same and that would be negative one
times<00:05:50.389> X<00:05:53.210> so<00:05:54.210> run<00:05:54.569> that<00:05:54.770> negative<00:05:55.770> one<00:05:55.949> into

00:05:56.379 --> 00:05:56.389 
times X so run that negative one into

00:05:56.389 --> 00:06:00.649 
times X so run that negative one into
the<00:05:57.800> the<00:05:58.800> offset<00:05:59.219> distance<00:05:59.400> and<00:05:59.909> then<00:06:00.479> that

00:06:00.649 --> 00:06:00.659 
the the offset distance and then that

00:06:00.659 --> 00:06:04.790 
the the offset distance and then that
way<00:06:00.840> when<00:06:01.229> we<00:06:01.409> change<00:06:01.650> the<00:06:03.110> the<00:06:04.110> cross<00:06:04.319> section

00:06:04.790 --> 00:06:04.800 
way when we change the the cross section

00:06:04.800 --> 00:06:06.709 
way when we change the the cross section
it<00:06:04.979> won't<00:06:05.490> change<00:06:05.759> the<00:06:05.880> area<00:06:06.180> of<00:06:06.360> our<00:06:06.479> room

00:06:06.709 --> 00:06:06.719 
it won't change the area of our room

00:06:06.719 --> 00:06:10.959 
it won't change the area of our room
just<00:06:07.469> the<00:06:07.590> the<00:06:08.310> framing<00:06:08.789> members<00:06:09.240> themselves

00:06:10.959 --> 00:06:10.969 
just the the framing members themselves

00:06:10.969 --> 00:06:14.899 
just the the framing members themselves
so<00:06:11.969> that's<00:06:12.630> it<00:06:12.990> and<00:06:13.229> I<00:06:13.800> hope<00:06:14.130> you<00:06:14.400> learned

00:06:14.899 --> 00:06:14.909 
so that's it and I hope you learned

00:06:14.909 --> 00:06:17.150 
so that's it and I hope you learned
something
