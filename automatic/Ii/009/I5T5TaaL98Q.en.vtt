00:00:59.529 --> 00:00:59.539 
one word to me serendipity made me

00:00:59.539 --> 00:01:04.119 
one word to me serendipity made me
realize<00:00:59.989> then<00:01:00.410> that<00:01:00.850> our<00:01:01.850> lives<00:01:02.750> the<00:01:03.440> diseases

00:01:04.119 --> 00:01:04.129 
realize then that our lives the diseases

00:01:04.129 --> 00:01:06.490 
realize then that our lives the diseases
were<00:01:04.280> destined<00:01:04.820> to<00:01:04.879> get<00:01:05.119> are<00:01:05.380> for<00:01:06.380> the<00:01:06.470> most

00:01:06.490 --> 00:01:06.500 
were destined to get are for the most

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:09.370 
were destined to get are for the most
part<00:01:06.880> serendipitous<00:01:07.880> why<00:01:08.869> would<00:01:09.110> a<00:01:09.140> doctor

00:01:09.370 --> 00:01:09.380 
part serendipitous why would a doctor

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:12.179 
part serendipitous why would a doctor
feel<00:01:09.920> that<00:01:10.189> way<00:01:10.400> well<00:01:11.150> it's<00:01:11.360> simply<00:01:11.780> this

00:01:12.179 --> 00:01:12.189 
feel that way well it's simply this

00:01:12.189 --> 00:01:14.859 
feel that way well it's simply this
there<00:01:13.189> are<00:01:13.430> some<00:01:13.729> things<00:01:13.970> that<00:01:14.119> you<00:01:14.390> do<00:01:14.630> have

00:01:14.859 --> 00:01:14.869 
there are some things that you do have

00:01:14.869 --> 00:01:17.500 
there are some things that you do have
control<00:01:15.170> over<00:01:15.549> you<00:01:16.549> should<00:01:16.610> do<00:01:16.939> all<00:01:17.150> of<00:01:17.180> your

00:01:17.500 --> 00:01:17.510 
control over you should do all of your

00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:20.350 
control over you should do all of your
prophylactic<00:01:18.439> exams<00:01:18.920> that<00:01:19.310> would<00:01:19.700> be<00:01:19.880> in<00:01:20.150> my

00:01:20.350 --> 00:01:20.360 
prophylactic exams that would be in my

00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:24.969 
prophylactic exams that would be in my
field<00:01:20.659> pap<00:01:20.960> smears<00:01:22.330> mammograms<00:01:23.330> and<00:01:23.979> annual

00:01:24.969 --> 00:01:24.979 
field pap smears mammograms and annual

00:01:24.979 --> 00:01:27.820 
field pap smears mammograms and annual
checkups<00:01:25.900> certainly<00:01:26.900> in<00:01:27.049> other<00:01:27.200> fields<00:01:27.560> I

00:01:27.820 --> 00:01:27.830 
checkups certainly in other fields I

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:29.710 
checkups certainly in other fields I
think<00:01:28.070> there<00:01:28.250> are<00:01:28.369> routine<00:01:28.850> things<00:01:29.299> done<00:01:29.540> at

00:01:29.710 --> 00:01:29.720 
think there are routine things done at

00:01:29.720 --> 00:01:32.859 
think there are routine things done at
certain<00:01:30.049> ages<00:01:30.200> such<00:01:31.189> as<00:01:31.369> colonoscopies<00:01:32.329> chest

00:01:32.859 --> 00:01:32.869 
certain ages such as colonoscopies chest

00:01:32.869 --> 00:01:37.210 
certain ages such as colonoscopies chest
x-rays<00:01:33.320> etc<00:01:33.560> I<00:01:34.240> feel<00:01:35.240> that<00:01:35.420> these<00:01:35.630> will<00:01:36.220> swing

00:01:37.210 --> 00:01:37.220 
x-rays etc I feel that these will swing

00:01:37.220 --> 00:01:39.760 
x-rays etc I feel that these will swing
the<00:01:37.250> pendulum<00:01:37.790> into<00:01:38.270> your<00:01:38.420> favor<00:01:38.720> you<00:01:39.530> can

00:01:39.760 --> 00:01:39.770 
the pendulum into your favor you can

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:42.340 
the pendulum into your favor you can
control<00:01:40.220> them<00:01:40.490> and<00:01:40.670> hopefully<00:01:41.509> extend<00:01:42.229> your

00:01:42.340 --> 00:01:42.350 
control them and hopefully extend your

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:45.910 
control them and hopefully extend your
life<00:01:43.150> but<00:01:44.150> in<00:01:44.299> terms<00:01:44.329> of<00:01:44.869> other<00:01:45.049> significant

life but in terms of other significant
diseases<00:01:46.549> cancer<00:01:47.540> is<00:01:47.840> primarily<00:01:48.729> with<00:01:49.729> the

no good evidence on how to prevent
cancers<00:01:56.829> terrible<00:01:57.829> thing<00:01:58.040> I<00:01:58.189> guess<00:01:58.430> for<00:01:58.640> a

00:01:58.690 --> 00:01:58.700 
cancers terrible thing I guess for a

doctor to say but we all are going to

00:02:00.860 --> 00:02:03.639 
doctor to say but we all are going to
expire<00:02:01.310> eventually<00:02:02.119> so<00:02:02.930> what<00:02:03.140> is<00:02:03.259> the<00:02:03.409> point

00:02:03.639 --> 00:02:03.649 
expire eventually so what is the point

00:02:03.649 --> 00:02:08.199 
expire eventually so what is the point
of<00:02:03.939> serendipity<00:02:04.939> the<00:02:05.899> point<00:02:06.229> is<00:02:06.409> this<00:02:07.209> enjoy
