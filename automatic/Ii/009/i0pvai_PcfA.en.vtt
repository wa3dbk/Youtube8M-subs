00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.319
 they threw the balls I was 

00:00:02.190 --> 00:00:06.930
 as long as I was down in the garden 

00:00:04.319 --> 00:00:09.660
 so many that came inside you can also 

00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:12.210
 evening can even draw and 

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:14.580
 so in short 20 was one 

00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:18.210
 liberation 15 numbers deserved it 

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:20.910
 guys from the game they did 

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:24.180
 therefore they did not deserve to suffer the 

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:26.279
 draw and then the goal for me was 

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:27.480
 a vibration I said first year from 

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:31.019
 issuer that can no longer be 

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:33.320
 turn out to be talking so it's no I don't care 

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:35.940
 euro to exult because really happy 

00:00:33.320 --> 00:00:37.920
 if I live happy for the 3 to 0 for the three 

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:39.719
 goals made or why we are not back 

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:41.190
 take goal we defended team 

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:42.899
 no no no I 'm happy with the victory 

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:47.010
 then they could even take goals 

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:49.649
 I honestly think that medicine for 

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:52.890
 everything is always the victory then obtained 

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:56.010
 so I think it's even more important 

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:58.260
 more bigger because in large wounds 

00:00:56.010 --> 00:01:01.320
 for so long great sacrifice from 

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:03.870
 part of everyone and therefore I believe it is the 

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:08.490
 what what that is not so much to do three 

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:10.560
 goal to take but is the pincher of a 

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:13.040
 player who grew up worked 

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:16.229
 being rightly bears fruit 

00:01:13.040 --> 00:01:18.630
 but to say today we mark brands 

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:20.280
 turbe fact can not understand them credit 

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:21.479
 what has now taken an hour 

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:24.750
 really very high level 

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:27.689
 marchino and therefore a hunter than always 

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:29.549
 in the in the viewfinder of the oi 

00:01:27.689 --> 00:01:32.070
 two central or whoever came in I think it is 

00:01:29.549 --> 00:01:34.500
 difficult believe that buddha team 

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:36.780
 we have returned to those that are 

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:39.090
 we were then us when we are the 

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:40.799
 verona we can win with everyone with 

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:43.229
 all independent we find of 

00:01:40.799 --> 00:01:45.180
 in the face of many races we also have them 

00:01:43.229 --> 00:01:47.009
 lost however we have always played and 

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:48.940
 I believe in 31 games 

00:01:47.009 --> 00:01:50.680
 the game that I believe not 

00:01:48.940 --> 00:01:52.780
 it wasn't ours it was Wednesday 

00:01:50.680 --> 00:01:55.090
 in Cagliari it is perhaps a time in Genoa for 

00:01:52.780 --> 00:01:58.630
 Verona has done incredible things 

00:01:55.090 --> 00:02:00.610
 even when it will lose then it never is 

00:01:58.630 --> 00:02:02.100
 disappeared in the mandate via verona will ask 

00:02:00.610 --> 00:02:04.630
 that when you lose 4 balls in a row 

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:08.320
 regardless of how they came about a bit 

00:02:04.630 --> 00:02:10.780
 of conviction a bit of place of po 

00:02:08.320 --> 00:02:12.370
 certainties you may miss today because 

00:02:10.780 --> 00:02:15.700
 beyond the goals he made me 

00:02:12.370 --> 00:02:17.170
 really the game they really are 

00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:19.480
 just exploded like that because i was a bit 

00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:22.780
 happier than what he did that 

00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:24.910
 they deserved because the week works 

00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:27.550
 the results are not therefore 

00:02:24.910 --> 00:02:30.370
 really good we did so many things 

00:02:27.550 --> 00:02:32.590
 I'm happy because the work then 

00:02:30.370 --> 00:02:33.970
 in quotation marks in the long run pays but is not 

00:02:32.590 --> 00:02:35.500
 always like this because I repeat Wednesday and 

00:02:33.970 --> 00:02:38.560
 they think they have done another game 

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:41.320
 acts of the worst however in 31 races a 

00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:43.810
 championship difficult to be promoted by 

00:02:41.320 --> 00:02:45.880
 so many things can also be there 

00:02:43.810 --> 00:02:48.040
 it was always a bit bigger though 

00:02:45.880 --> 00:02:50.050
 then there are the matches the results do not 

00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:52.150
 therefore mine came for that 

00:02:50.050 --> 00:02:54.280
 findings really deserved it 

00:02:52.150 --> 00:02:56.050
 because it was hard for you are 

00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:58.480
 sacrificed and I think the most 

00:02:56.050 --> 00:03:00.459
 beautiful both that win and two 

00:02:58.480 --> 00:03:03.310
 second goal adh made goal luca 

00:03:00.459 --> 00:03:06.160
 tones are the emblem of the team 

00:03:03.310 --> 00:03:07.540
 who played for the mate who a 

00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:09.010
 mate does not need to make 12 goals 

00:03:07.540 --> 00:03:10.540
 because in short, we already know who he is 

00:03:09.010 --> 00:03:12.820
 that is the emblem of a team that has 

00:03:10.540 --> 00:03:14.380
 really wanted to do things as a team 

00:03:12.820 --> 00:03:15.989
 even in situations that may march 

00:03:14.380 --> 00:03:19.450
 could try to find the personal goal 

00:03:15.989 --> 00:03:21.459
 instead it was really perfect here 

00:03:19.450 --> 00:03:23.709
 if I have to say the absolute best of con 

00:03:21.459 --> 00:03:26.970
 margins that choice because there was 

00:03:23.709 --> 00:03:29.830
 really the team choice 

00:03:26.970 --> 00:03:32.250
 while it is me it is almost me 

00:03:29.830 --> 00:03:34.840
 really moved and exploded because 

00:03:32.250 --> 00:03:39.189
 we deserved to win it 's game talk 

00:03:34.840 --> 00:03:41.260
 brand I never doubted played in 

00:03:39.189 --> 00:03:43.720
 many roles today he did 3 4 roles 

00:03:41.260 --> 00:03:46.239
 outside the middle of the field then minutes 

00:03:43.720 --> 00:03:48.069
 left low player of 

00:03:46.239 --> 00:03:50.940
 quality of sacrifices we are now very much 

00:03:48.069 --> 00:03:52.980
 happy and luca 

00:03:50.940 --> 00:03:55.620
 today he broke the record holding the 

00:03:52.980 --> 00:03:57.600
 history of the attackers of Verona 

00:03:55.620 --> 00:04:00.090
 so today we also have 46 goals 

00:03:57.600 --> 00:04:01.710
 which he never did in four years 

00:04:00.090 --> 00:04:04.590
 we have made so many records 

00:04:01.710 --> 00:04:06.150
 maybe we hope it's not infinite and I know it 

00:04:04.590 --> 00:04:08.220
 but he looks at the chart and for a month 

00:04:06.150 --> 00:04:10.800
 have been firm 1 says a little 

00:04:08.220 --> 00:04:12.990
 regret comes to you, however, I believe it is yes 

00:04:10.800 --> 00:04:15.510
 he also erred because I repeat today the 

00:04:12.990 --> 00:04:19.380
 31st and I think the team went i 

00:04:15.510 --> 00:04:20.670
 mean then for some time to some 

00:04:19.380 --> 00:04:22.260
 what didn't go the right way 

00:04:20.670 --> 00:04:24.030
 we also stopped playing one 

00:04:22.260 --> 00:04:26.130
 a certain way 

00:04:24.030 --> 00:04:28.800
 we do a little more effort throughout 

00:04:26.130 --> 00:04:30.630
 psychologically and physically we have 

00:04:28.800 --> 00:04:33.800
 paid even if I repeat I believe the 

00:04:30.630 --> 00:04:35.580
 parma defeat but there was not 

00:04:33.800 --> 00:04:37.620
 perhaps 

00:04:35.580 --> 00:04:39.720
 something has not turned out for today not 

00:04:37.620 --> 00:04:43.379
 we waited for nothing we went to 

00:04:39.720 --> 00:04:45.060
 take this victory above all e 

00:04:43.379 --> 00:04:47.969
 even in inferiority so we don't have 

00:04:45.060 --> 00:04:50.400
 waited for the 

00:04:47.969 --> 00:04:53.129
 result we struggled if there are 

00:04:50.400 --> 00:04:55.340
 simplified and a victory came 

00:04:53.129 --> 00:04:55.340
 gorgeous
