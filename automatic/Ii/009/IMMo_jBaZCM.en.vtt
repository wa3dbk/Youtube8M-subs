fruits<00:00:12.389> are<00:00:12.599> produced<00:00:13.139> on<00:00:13.380> these<00:00:14.190> older<00:00:14.670> canes

00:00:14.990 --> 00:00:15.000 
fruits are produced on these older canes

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.090 
fruits are produced on these older canes
they're<00:00:15.269> called<00:00:15.480> flora<00:00:15.929> canes<00:00:16.289> flora<00:00:16.830> for

00:00:17.090 --> 00:00:17.100 
they're called flora canes flora for

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:19.519 
they're called flora canes flora for
flowering<00:00:17.609> so<00:00:18.180> our<00:00:18.300> flowering<00:00:18.960> canes<00:00:19.260> are

00:00:19.519 --> 00:00:19.529 
flowering so our flowering canes are

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:20.900 
flowering so our flowering canes are
where<00:00:19.740> the<00:00:19.859> Purdue<00:00:20.130> the<00:00:20.400> fruit<00:00:20.640> is<00:00:20.760> produced

00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:20.910 
where the Purdue the fruit is produced

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:23.150 
where the Purdue the fruit is produced
but<00:00:21.720> the<00:00:21.840> plants<00:00:22.170> have<00:00:22.289> also<00:00:22.439> been<00:00:22.710> actively

00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:23.160 
but the plants have also been actively

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:25.939 
but the plants have also been actively
growing<00:00:23.820> new<00:00:24.510> shoots<00:00:24.930> these<00:00:25.199> first-year

00:00:25.939 --> 00:00:25.949 
growing new shoots these first-year

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:28.220 
growing new shoots these first-year
shoots<00:00:26.220> are<00:00:26.400> called<00:00:26.640> primo<00:00:27.150> canes<00:00:27.570> and<00:00:27.869> this

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:28.230 
shoots are called primo canes and this

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:30.410 
shoots are called primo canes and this
would<00:00:28.410> be<00:00:28.500> an<00:00:28.590> example<00:00:28.710> of<00:00:29.160> that<00:00:29.220> and<00:00:29.609> this

00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:30.420 
would be an example of that and this

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:33.350 
would be an example of that and this
cane<00:00:30.840> is<00:00:31.140> going<00:00:31.769> to<00:00:31.890> produce<00:00:32.099> next<00:00:32.940> year's

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:33.360 
cane is going to produce next year's

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:35.840 
cane is going to produce next year's
fruit<00:00:33.660> now<00:00:34.530> if<00:00:34.680> you<00:00:34.829> look<00:00:34.980> at<00:00:35.070> our<00:00:35.219> trellis<00:00:35.670> we

newer shoots separate raspberries have a

00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:57.860 
newer shoots separate raspberries have a
very<00:00:56.160> interesting<00:00:56.489> life<00:00:56.760> cycle<00:00:57.360> because<00:00:57.660> each

00:00:57.860 --> 00:00:57.870 
very interesting life cycle because each

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:00.319 
very interesting life cycle because each
chute<00:00:58.170> lives<00:00:58.500> for<00:00:58.800> two<00:00:58.980> years<00:00:59.309> the<00:00:59.670> first<00:00:59.699> year

00:01:00.319 --> 00:01:00.329 
chute lives for two years the first year

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:03.770 
chute lives for two years the first year
it<00:01:00.600> grows<00:01:01.230> the<00:01:01.590> second<00:01:02.070> year<00:01:02.250> it<00:01:02.600> flowers<00:01:03.600> and

00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:03.780 
it grows the second year it flowers and

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:05.750 
it grows the second year it flowers and
fruits<00:01:04.110> and<00:01:04.379> then<00:01:05.010> after<00:01:05.430> it's<00:01:05.549> finished

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:05.760 
fruits and then after it's finished

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:08.330 
fruits and then after it's finished
fruiting<00:01:06.390> we<00:01:06.510> remove<00:01:06.869> it<00:01:07.080> so<00:01:07.500> by<00:01:07.680> tying<00:01:08.010> all<00:01:08.310> of

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:08.340 
fruiting we remove it so by tying all of

fruits on it and the older cane back

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:33.620 
fruits on it and the older cane back
here<00:01:31.650> you<00:01:32.220> can<00:01:32.369> see<00:01:32.430> there's<00:01:33.060> some<00:01:33.270> spent

so<00:01:56.579> as<00:01:56.880> the<00:01:57.149> Canes<00:01:57.420> grow<00:01:57.869> our<00:01:58.290> first-year

00:01:59.060 --> 00:01:59.070 
so as the Canes grow our first-year

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:01.219 
so as the Canes grow our first-year
canes<00:01:59.369> are<00:01:59.610> prime<00:01:59.820> Akane's<00:02:00.149> they're<00:02:00.780> very

00:02:01.219 --> 00:02:01.229 
canes are prime Akane's they're very

00:02:01.229 --> 00:02:04.639 
canes are prime Akane's they're very
vigorous<00:02:01.759> they<00:02:02.759> can<00:02:03.030> grow<00:02:03.270> to<00:02:03.600> great<00:02:04.170> lengths

00:02:04.639 --> 00:02:04.649 
vigorous they can grow to great lengths

00:02:04.649 --> 00:02:06.649 
vigorous they can grow to great lengths
and<00:02:04.770> sometimes<00:02:05.159> become<00:02:05.520> a<00:02:05.549> bit<00:02:05.850> unruly<00:02:06.210> so

00:02:06.649 --> 00:02:06.659 
and sometimes become a bit unruly so

00:02:06.659 --> 00:02:07.999 
and sometimes become a bit unruly so

Canes what we're doing is you can see
here<00:02:47.220> there's<00:02:47.700> a<00:02:47.790> little<00:02:47.970> lateral<00:02:48.300> chute

00:02:48.830 --> 00:02:48.840 
here there's a little lateral chute

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:51.710 
here there's a little lateral chute
we're<00:02:49.410> encouraging<00:02:50.160> this<00:02:50.670> lateral<00:02:51.120> chute<00:02:51.510> and

00:02:51.710 --> 00:02:51.720 
we're encouraging this lateral chute and

00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:53.300 
we're encouraging this lateral chute and
all<00:02:51.900> the<00:02:52.020> other<00:02:52.200> lateral<00:02:52.650> shoots<00:02:52.920> up<00:02:53.130> around

00:02:53.300 --> 00:02:53.310 
all the other lateral shoots up around

00:02:53.310 --> 00:02:56.150 
all the other lateral shoots up around
the<00:02:53.490> top<00:02:53.670> of<00:02:53.700> the<00:02:53.880> plant<00:02:54.120> to<00:02:54.630> grow<00:02:54.840> and<00:02:55.170> this<00:02:55.800> is

00:02:56.150 --> 00:02:56.160 
the top of the plant to grow and this is

00:02:56.160 --> 00:02:58.610 
the top of the plant to grow and this is
where<00:02:56.400> next<00:02:57.060> year's<00:02:57.300> fruit<00:02:57.630> is<00:02:57.840> going<00:02:58.320> to<00:02:58.500> be

00:02:58.610 --> 00:02:58.620 
where next year's fruit is going to be

00:02:58.620 --> 00:03:01.940 
where next year's fruit is going to be
produced<00:02:59.100> and<00:02:59.400> when<00:03:00.030> we<00:03:00.180> tip<00:03:00.540> and<00:03:00.950> produce

00:03:01.940 --> 00:03:01.950 
produced and when we tip and produce

00:03:01.950 --> 00:03:04.190 
produced and when we tip and produce
this<00:03:02.250> lateral<00:03:02.790> growth<00:03:03.060> we're<00:03:03.600> encouraging

00:03:04.190 --> 00:03:04.200 
this lateral growth we're encouraging

00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:06.530 
this lateral growth we're encouraging
that<00:03:04.380> fruit<00:03:04.680> to<00:03:04.710> be<00:03:04.950> up<00:03:05.160> high<00:03:05.430> at<00:03:05.820> a<00:03:06.120> level

00:03:06.530 --> 00:03:06.540 
that fruit to be up high at a level

00:03:06.540 --> 00:03:09.620 
that fruit to be up high at a level
where<00:03:06.660> it's<00:03:06.810> very<00:03:06.930> easy<00:03:07.290> to<00:03:08.010> harvest<00:03:08.340> it<00:03:08.820> but

00:03:09.620 --> 00:03:09.630 
where it's very easy to harvest it but

00:03:09.630 --> 00:03:11.930 
where it's very easy to harvest it but
it<00:03:09.750> also<00:03:09.980> prevents<00:03:10.980> fruits<00:03:11.280> from<00:03:11.490> going<00:03:11.730> all

00:03:11.930 --> 00:03:11.940 
it also prevents fruits from going all

00:03:11.940 --> 00:03:13.880 
it also prevents fruits from going all
the<00:03:12.270> way<00:03:12.300> down<00:03:12.660> the<00:03:12.870> stem<00:03:13.110> if<00:03:13.230> we<00:03:13.350> didn't<00:03:13.680> tip

00:03:13.880 --> 00:03:13.890 
the way down the stem if we didn't tip

00:03:13.890 --> 00:03:15.320 
the way down the stem if we didn't tip
the<00:03:14.130> fruit<00:03:14.340> would<00:03:14.460> be<00:03:14.580> produced<00:03:14.910> all<00:03:15.120> the<00:03:15.270> way

00:03:15.320 --> 00:03:15.330 
the fruit would be produced all the way

00:03:15.330 --> 00:03:18.080 
the fruit would be produced all the way
down<00:03:15.510> the<00:03:15.660> stem<00:03:15.930> it'd<00:03:16.860> be<00:03:17.010> closer<00:03:17.310> to<00:03:17.580> the<00:03:17.700> soil

00:03:18.080 --> 00:03:18.090 
down the stem it'd be closer to the soil

00:03:18.090 --> 00:03:20.150 
down the stem it'd be closer to the soil
so<00:03:18.450> you<00:03:18.510> have<00:03:18.780> dirtier<00:03:19.260> fruit<00:03:19.620> and<00:03:19.800> more

00:03:20.150 --> 00:03:20.160 
so you have dirtier fruit and more

00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:22.250 
so you have dirtier fruit and more
potential<00:03:20.730> for<00:03:20.910> disease<00:03:21.240> so<00:03:21.540> by<00:03:21.720> tipping

00:03:22.250 --> 00:03:22.260 
potential for disease so by tipping

00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:25.010 
potential for disease so by tipping
we're<00:03:22.920> making<00:03:23.550> our<00:03:23.670> harvest<00:03:24.060> easier<00:03:24.480> we're

00:03:25.010 --> 00:03:25.020 
we're making our harvest easier we're

00:03:25.020 --> 00:03:28.250 
we're making our harvest easier we're
also<00:03:25.260> going<00:03:25.710> to<00:03:25.800> encourage<00:03:26.540> higher<00:03:27.540> yield<00:03:27.990> and

00:03:28.250 --> 00:03:28.260 
also going to encourage higher yield and

00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:31.700 
also going to encourage higher yield and
larger<00:03:28.890> better<00:03:29.100> quality<00:03:29.610> fruits<00:03:30.560> now<00:03:31.560> we're

00:03:31.700 --> 00:03:31.710 
larger better quality fruits now we're

00:03:31.710 --> 00:03:33.620 
larger better quality fruits now we're
going<00:03:31.830> to<00:03:31.890> use<00:03:32.040> the<00:03:32.250> same<00:03:32.520> type<00:03:32.820> of<00:03:32.850> pruning<00:03:33.510> on

00:03:33.620 --> 00:03:33.630 
going to use the same type of pruning on

00:03:33.630 --> 00:03:36.320 
going to use the same type of pruning on
our<00:03:33.990> blackberry<00:03:34.590> plants<00:03:35.100> as<00:03:35.280> well<00:03:35.550> very

00:03:36.320 --> 00:03:36.330 
our blackberry plants as well very

00:03:36.330 --> 00:03:39.830 
our blackberry plants as well very
similar<00:03:36.900> process<00:03:37.740> and<00:03:38.280> not<00:03:38.820> all<00:03:39.120> of<00:03:39.150> our<00:03:39.390> Canes
