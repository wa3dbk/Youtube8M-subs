00:00:08.240 --> 00:00:12.750
 but because both ingredients 

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:14.280
 I bring this game that was very very very 

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:16.800
 good that I was recommended a lot 

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:19.200
 forums where subjected even 

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:20.820
 call 4x4 jump street 'and the game then 

00:00:19.200 --> 00:00:22.170
 it's totally free as always these 

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:23.550
 games that are free because he calls me 

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:24.990
 the attention and has very good graphics 

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:26.700
 apart that also has support for 

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:29.220
 google play game so they can to 

00:00:26.700 --> 00:00:31.739
 scores and so on and it also has a 

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:33.420
 very cool menu this as you can see 

00:00:31.739 --> 00:00:35.489
 maybe the adjustments have what it is for 

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:38.760
 graphic quality can have it in 

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:40.110
 high medium low and good came extra 

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:41.670
 by default here to see that they are 

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:43.530
 enabled to see and we also have what 

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:45.720
 what is the slider music points 

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:48.690
 of the sound and what the dialogues are 

00:00:45.720 --> 00:00:52.110
 also what are the controls that 

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:53.550
 we have this automatic expense and handling 

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:55.350
 by top I like it a lot so I'm going 

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:56.670
 to leave and we also have credits but 

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:58.860
 let's go play a fast race 

00:00:56.670 --> 00:01:01.530
 so that it treats the game this 

00:00:58.860 --> 00:01:03.240
 let's start having a rhythm of 

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:05.939
 game eg in collector mode the 

00:01:03.240 --> 00:01:08.430
 career mode knockout mode and mode 

00:01:05.939 --> 00:01:09.840
 sprint then catch the freeride is 

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:11.520
 very nice because basically nothing more 

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:13.650
 walks like crazy for the world can be what 

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:15.060
 that you want but let's take the 

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:17.700
 mode 

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:18.960
 knockout because this is more parents is like 

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:22.649
 that has more action here we are going to catch 

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:24.180
 the hawai field of Hawaiian father but it 's 

00:01:22.649 --> 00:01:25.979
 blocked so let's start with 

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:27.810
 this because you have to go forward is 

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:29.250
 I have everything blocked because it 's just the 

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:32.189
 first time we play it let's start 

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:34.229
 with what the virus is and let's start with 

00:01:32.189 --> 00:01:36.090
 the race the game the truth that you see 

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:37.530
 incredible the photos the forum is coming 

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:39.570
 touch a key that you measured me 

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:41.610
 This one really catches my attention 

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:43.679
 good the future of ios but I imagine that 

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:45.000
 who android also looks like this and this one 

00:01:43.679 --> 00:01:48.079
 well sometimes there are differences a little 

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:48.079
 the graphics between one 

00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:51.490
 I'm trying it for the first time here 

00:01:49.689 --> 00:01:54.040
 with you why so the emotion is 

00:01:51.490 --> 00:01:56.530
 more and more of surprise that everything is like 

00:01:54.040 --> 00:01:57.820
 that at the moment and one as you can see 

00:01:56.530 --> 00:01:59.619
 here we have to go to the points that 

00:01:57.820 --> 00:02:02.500
 They have one very similar to racing 

00:01:59.619 --> 00:02:03.909
 gta san andrÃ©s that you have to go to the 

00:02:02.500 --> 00:02:05.619
 parts there is no like that good shines 

00:02:03.909 --> 00:02:08.450
 here is also tell you where 

00:02:05.619 --> 00:02:10.280
 you have to go for example 

00:02:08.450 --> 00:02:12.500
 here we are going to organize the race because 

00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:17.830
 I left badly, they have to go playing the 

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:17.830
 juices and today he made a serious mistake 

00:02:18.580 --> 00:02:24.200
 because you saw me that trolls 

00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:26.480
 tanker is massively as they can 

00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:28.310
 see they have to go through the das is like 

00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:29.750
 what smoke doors so that 

00:02:28.310 --> 00:02:31.160
 discount what the checkpoint is if you 

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:33.530
 they go on the other hand they're going to have to 

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:35.690
 come back until they go through the 

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:37.790
 as it were outside and smoke goalposts 

00:02:35.690 --> 00:02:39.200
 how to call them exactly but if not 

00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:40.520
 they go by there does not count then they have 

00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:42.320
 what to do and how can you see 

00:02:40.520 --> 00:02:44.209
 graphics or good we are in ultra mode or 

00:02:42.320 --> 00:02:46.190
 something like it's called the maximum mode and 

00:02:44.209 --> 00:02:48.530
 the graphics look very good since 

00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:51.260
 let's have dynamic shadows have 

00:02:48.530 --> 00:02:52.850
 even grass particles when moving and 

00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:54.800
 not only happened but it depends on madrid 

00:02:52.850 --> 00:02:57.950
 where you are and also has what 

00:02:54.800 --> 00:02:59.270
 is this the reflections of the sun as they can 

00:02:57.950 --> 00:03:01.430
 at the top which looks 

00:02:59.270 --> 00:03:03.300
 incredible and I think I'm not around 

00:03:01.430 --> 00:03:05.250
 another side that was not 

00:03:03.300 --> 00:03:08.210
 what we already deviate or that already already 

00:03:05.250 --> 00:03:10.500
 we lost the race 

00:03:08.210 --> 00:03:12.210
 god we do not in fact go in second place 

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:14.580
 even though we got lost we see it in 

00:03:12.210 --> 00:03:16.770
 second place in the video but the game 

00:03:14.580 --> 00:03:18.390
 It is very good in case it arrives 

00:03:16.770 --> 00:03:20.250
 a guy like I always tell them 

00:03:18.390 --> 00:03:22.140
 in adjustments they can go in the part that they 

00:03:20.250 --> 00:03:23.430
 I showed the beginning and put it in the 

00:03:22.140 --> 00:03:25.200
 lower in graphics in given case that 

00:03:23.430 --> 00:03:27.690
 have a lot of water something like that the game 

00:03:25.200 --> 00:03:29.850
 it's very very light it does not weigh this anymore 

00:03:27.690 --> 00:03:33.450
 installed and everything does not weigh or 400 megabytes 

00:03:29.850 --> 00:03:35.550
 weighs about 200 and more or less and this one 

00:03:33.450 --> 00:03:37.230
 It is compatible with Android four for 

00:03:35.550 --> 00:03:38.700
 up I have understood but there was 

00:03:37.230 --> 00:03:40.560
 reports of people in the forum that 

00:03:38.700 --> 00:03:43.410
 do playing on android 2.3 so 

00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:44.670
 the same thing is going to work this and then 

00:03:43.410 --> 00:03:45.990
 well the game I love we'll be 

00:03:44.670 --> 00:03:48.000
 here and win the race to finish the 

00:03:45.990 --> 00:03:49.440
 video as always here we are going to bring 

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:51.360
 such games any ship notice 

00:03:49.440 --> 00:03:53.640
 you already know what can happen to report 

00:03:51.360 --> 00:03:55.980
 to the place tour and when they report the 

00:03:53.640 --> 00:03:57.660
 book you can comment what it showed sent 

00:03:55.980 --> 00:03:59.190
 something like that and also I always commented on 

00:03:57.660 --> 00:04:00.930
 this matter of what device they have 

00:03:59.190 --> 00:04:03.660
 what version of android have in die 

00:04:00.930 --> 00:04:05.010
 case that does not open them or give them some 

00:04:03.660 --> 00:04:07.110
 graphic error because it is very important 

00:04:05.010 --> 00:04:08.489
 for those who made the game know what 

00:04:07.110 --> 00:04:09.420
 problems have on which device 

00:04:08.489 --> 00:04:11.310
 they have 

00:04:09.420 --> 00:04:12.810
 because that way they will be able to work in the 

00:04:11.310 --> 00:04:14.099
 problems and repair them because if nothing 

00:04:12.810 --> 00:04:16.680
 more they tell them not that the cars are 

00:04:14.099 --> 00:04:18.120
 they move blacks to the heat they are and they do not 

00:04:16.680 --> 00:04:19.290
 they say what device has a position not 

00:04:18.120 --> 00:04:20.639
 can fix so always always 

00:04:19.290 --> 00:04:22.139
 I tell you this I know we're going to do 

00:04:20.639 --> 00:04:24.930
 you play a lot with that is very important 

00:04:22.139 --> 00:04:26.250
 so that a free game like this one 

00:04:24.930 --> 00:04:27.870
 go improve then I think it 's 

00:04:26.250 --> 00:04:30.630
 all for this video the game is very 

00:04:27.870 --> 00:04:32.340
 very good this and well they can 

00:04:30.630 --> 00:04:35.580
 unlocking tracks and cars as soon as 

00:04:32.340 --> 00:04:37.220
 more are advancing but I do not know will be this 

00:04:35.580 --> 00:04:39.270
 that you investigate find out and 

00:04:37.220 --> 00:04:41.460
 enjoy it as always I just 

00:04:39.270 --> 00:04:42.930
 I bring what is is come bring a bit of 

00:04:41.460 --> 00:04:44.820
 commercials for this matter that is 

00:04:42.930 --> 00:04:46.620
 free as usual in all your things 

00:04:44.820 --> 00:04:49.979
 that has brought you but as always 

00:04:46.620 --> 00:04:51.960
 I tell you this global is worth it because the 

00:04:49.979 --> 00:04:53.700
 true that the game is free and you see 

00:04:51.960 --> 00:04:55.500
 very well is a small commercial I do not 

00:04:53.700 --> 00:04:56.970
 annoying but as I always tell you 

00:04:55.500 --> 00:04:59.370
 It is also already as high as you 

00:04:56.970 --> 00:05:00.750
 enjoy it me is my extra part is a 

00:04:59.370 --> 00:05:03.000

 all the support because despite the fact that 

00:06:51.780 --> 00:06:56.280
 I have brought things that are not minecraft

00:06:56.280 --> 00:07:00.870
 I swear that that motivates me a lot because 

00:06:58.520 --> 00:07:02.940
 before they do not support me much as regards 

00:07:00.870 --> 00:07:04.260

00:07:02.940 --> 00:07:06.000
