00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.460
Hello

00:00:01.460 --> 00:00:07.960
At the moment Pioneer has two models of DJ effectors

00:00:07.960 --> 00:00:10.600
RMX-500 and RMX-1000

00:00:10.600 --> 00:00:13.180
In this video I will try to compare them

00:00:13.180 --> 00:00:15.880
Obviously, RMX-1000 is looks 

00:00:15.880 --> 00:00:18.680
a lot cooler, 
but actually each of them

00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:21.720
has own special functions

00:00:21.740 --> 00:00:24.180
This video will help you to understand

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:26.689
what suits you better

00:00:26.689 --> 00:00:29.630
In and Outs

00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:33.110
RMX 500 - all in and outs maded 

00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:33.969
on RCA connectors

00:00:33.969 --> 00:00:37.149
but here a big bonus -
Internal Audio interface

00:00:37.149 --> 00:00:39.780
and headphone out

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:41.820
with Volume adjustment

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:45.020
RMX-1000 has no Audio interface

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:47.400
Inputs maded on 

00:00:47.400 --> 00:00:49.280
RCA and Jack

00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:51.540
I wold like to note that if you will plug in,

00:00:51.540 --> 00:00:54.160
Jack and RCA at the same time

00:00:54.160 --> 00:00:56.960
Volume of input signal will decrease

00:00:57.450 --> 00:01:00.610
Both effectors having volume switches  

00:01:00.640 --> 00:01:03.120
depends of connection placement

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:05.720
in RMX-1000 it is

00:01:05.720 --> 00:01:08.180
+4 dB for Master 

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:10.880
-10 dB for send/return  

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:14.100
RMX-500 has 3 positions 

00:01:14.180 --> 00:01:17.380
-10, 0 and +4dB

00:01:17.380 --> 00:01:19.670
Order of effects

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:21.840
RMX-500 has switch

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:23.330
which allow to change

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:25.970
cirquit of effects

00:01:25.970 --> 00:01:28.690
it is mean, that you can enable scene effects to be first in signal path

00:01:28.690 --> 00:01:30.650
and rhythm effects will be second in signal path 

00:01:30.650 --> 00:01:32.450
or reverse it

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:34.650
For example you can do 

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:37.879
from Noise generator and Trans effect

00:01:37.879 --> 00:01:39.799
very interesting sound

00:01:39.799 --> 00:01:40.920
RMX-1000

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:43.739
which has same Noise and Trans, can’t do it

00:01:43.739 --> 00:01:47.479
it can’t be done 

00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:50.441
due to hardwired effect circuit 

00:01:50.441 --> 00:01:52.280
the consistency of effects can’t be changed

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:53.680
in addition i will note

00:01:53.680 --> 00:01:56.200
that RMX-1000 designed

00:01:56.200 --> 00:01:58.500
for professional equipment

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:01.000
for example DJM-900Nexus

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:04.440
has own noise generator

00:02:04.440 --> 00:02:05.900
Controls

00:02:05.900 --> 00:02:07.920
the big step forward

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:09.940
is applying

00:02:09.940 --> 00:02:12.610
in RMX-500, 
knobs which are not only tweaks

00:02:12.610 --> 00:02:15.440
but can be pressed also

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:18.180
it is allows you
to control with one knob

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:20.780
2 parameters of effect in the same time

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:23.340
RMX-1000 has no such function

00:02:23.349 --> 00:02:27.029
but obviously it will be implement in the next version

00:02:27.029 --> 00:02:28.360
Quantity of Loops

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:30.640
i would like to note about quantity of loop functions 

00:02:30.649 --> 00:02:34.449
which can be done on these remix stations

00:02:34.449 --> 00:02:38.160
there only one loop on RMX-500

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:44.999
it is Roll effect

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:48.020
Because Echo effect

00:02:48.020 --> 00:02:52.700
will be damped even at maximum parameters 

00:02:52.709 --> 00:02:55.519
RMX-1000 has up to

00:02:55.519 --> 00:02:58.659
4 independent loops

00:02:58.660 --> 00:03:01.680
in Source FX section

00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:04.300
in X-Pad section

00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:13.280
Echo effect at maximum

00:03:13.640 --> 00:03:19.860
and by Release FX (in Echo position)

00:03:19.869 --> 00:03:22.579
there one disputable moment

00:03:22.579 --> 00:03:25.199
in one of the effectors, part of the effects

00:03:25.199 --> 00:03:28.119
splited by frequency to 3 knobs

00:03:28.119 --> 00:03:31.379
which not very easy to tweak in the same time

00:03:31.529 --> 00:03:34.489
but partly - for example Add

00:03:34.489 --> 00:03:36.319
is nicely to add

00:03:36.319 --> 00:03:38.959
by separate frequency range

00:03:38.960 --> 00:03:44.359
for example HI
and it sounds very perfectly

00:03:44.359 --> 00:03:46.489
in RMX-500 all is controlled

00:03:46.489 --> 00:03:48.599
by one knob 
which affects

00:03:48.599 --> 00:03:50.930
on all frequency range

00:03:50.930 --> 00:03:54.129
there can be some distortion

00:03:54.129 --> 00:03:56.509
Software

00:03:56.509 --> 00:03:58.669
included software

00:03:58.669 --> 00:04:00.460
with RMX-500

00:04:00.460 --> 00:04:02.770
just manage the functions

00:04:02.770 --> 00:04:05.210
switch the MIDI,
help to manage

00:04:05.210 --> 00:04:07.499
inputs and outputs of the audio interface

00:04:07.499 --> 00:04:10.379
in case of RMX-1000
the software

00:04:10.379 --> 00:04:12.209
is Remixbox

00:04:12.209 --> 00:04:14.239
which allows you to change the settings

00:04:14.239 --> 00:04:16.259
very deep

00:04:16.259 --> 00:04:18.779
you can customise it for your needs

00:04:18.780 --> 00:04:21.120
The Remixbox has many parameters

00:04:21.120 --> 00:04:23.169
and you can set it exactly

00:04:23.169 --> 00:04:24.310
as you like

00:04:24.310 --> 00:04:26.930
by this program you can upload your own sounds 

00:04:26.930 --> 00:04:29.810
in sequencer, 
it is possible to upload 16 samples

00:04:29.810 --> 00:04:32.610
and 4 of them can be

00:04:32.610 --> 00:04:34.300
loops

00:04:34.460 --> 00:04:38.560
both remix stations
are having own VST plugins

00:04:38.560 --> 00:04:40.440
generally, RMX 1000

00:04:40.440 --> 00:04:42.840
has deeper customisation

00:04:42.840 --> 00:04:46.080
but main is to understand 
what you need

00:04:46.090 --> 00:04:48.460
there and volume adjustment

00:04:48.460 --> 00:04:50.860
and more volume scale 

00:04:50.860 --> 00:04:52.570
there is independent Picth control

00:04:52.570 --> 00:04:55.610
for samples, 
and possibility to momentally switch

00:04:55.610 --> 00:04:57.979
between standard settings

00:04:57.979 --> 00:05:02.179
 and your own settings,
which is doubles the functionality

00:05:02.360 --> 00:05:05.000
RMX-500
is comfortable and intuitive

00:05:05.010 --> 00:05:07.980
if it is your first effector

00:05:07.980 --> 00:05:10.860
this is the right choice

00:05:10.860 --> 00:05:14.160
there less effects and possibilities

00:05:14.170 --> 00:05:17.230
but very good quality
precisely those

00:05:17.230 --> 00:05:18.890
which doctor said

00:05:18.890 --> 00:05:23.270
up to 70% of work can be done by RMX-500

00:05:23.540 --> 00:05:25.500
in my opinion RMX-1000

00:05:25.510 --> 00:05:27.600
is more independently choice

00:05:27.600 --> 00:05:29.300
better integration 

00:05:29.300 --> 00:05:31.540
with top level gear

00:05:31.540 --> 00:05:33.620
perfectly complements each other

00:05:33.620 --> 00:05:34.890
RMX-500

00:05:34.890 --> 00:05:37.990
more suitable to work with controllers

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:39.960
if you have any questionns

00:05:39.960 --> 00:05:41.680
