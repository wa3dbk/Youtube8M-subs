 i.e. 2 may be second grades hour 

00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:45.450

00:02:43.769 --> 00:02:48.060
 now feels great about the world 

00:02:45.450 --> 00:02:49.650
 No matter how you guys are on average players 

00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:51.269
 enough why you think you are 

00:02:49.650 --> 00:02:53.310

00:02:51.269 --> 00:02:55.709

00:02:53.310 --> 00:02:58.170

00:02:55.709 --> 00:02:59.970

00:02:59.970 --> 00:03:04.950
 almost no one yelling to each other is not 

00:03:02.250 --> 00:03:07.110
 cheaters because well, as if I understand that 

00:03:04.950 --> 00:03:08.610

 haze no one will yell why am i 

00:03:08.610 --> 00:03:12.209
 I speak precisely from this title because 

00:03:10.019 --> 00:03:13.470
 just recently I was playing from the second 

00:03:12.209 --> 00:03:15.000
 an account which is not so big 

00:03:13.470 --> 00:03:18.450
 title that is a big star and 

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:20.700
 I met the guys from the team there 

00:03:18.450 --> 00:03:24.450
 from my team you probably who knows 

00:03:20.700 --> 00:03:26.430
 played on psp or a colleague have they in 

00:03:24.450 --> 00:03:29.700
 the box office will be sufficient not as something that 

00:03:26.430 --> 00:03:31.200
 efforts rather popular and yet 

00:03:29.700 --> 00:03:35.519
 no one could win guys that is 

00:03:31.200 --> 00:03:37.560
 experienced I was extremely surprised that the guys 

00:03:35.519 --> 00:03:40.079
 just called me a cheater after i play 

00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:42.450
 told you guys there are no longer those items 

00:03:40.079 --> 00:03:46.940

00:03:49.950 --> 00:03:54.030
 anti-cheat what is the difference result 

00:03:52.230 --> 00:03:55.349
 principle remained the same crush 

00:03:54.030 --> 00:03:57.480
 Okay, just want to see in all 

00:03:55.349 --> 00:03:59.310
 cheaters like that are enough and really not 

00:03:57.480 --> 00:04:01.200
 live and team bottom guys are looking for yourself 

00:03:59.310 --> 00:04:03.780
 No one will put you stronger 

00:04:01.200 --> 00:04:06.060
 helping guys this is your personal title not 

00:04:03.780 --> 00:04:07.440
 call your team at least there are cases 

00:04:06.060 --> 00:04:09.239
 when is the team really to blame 

00:04:07.440 --> 00:04:09.700
 repeat happens at the moment I already fuck up 

00:04:09.239 --> 00:04:11.650
 I see 

00:04:09.700 --> 00:04:13.390
 someone writes personally I choose good bio 

00:04:11.650 --> 00:04:15.340

 what moment which just runet skating rinks 

00:04:15.340 --> 00:04:20.290
 but this is not as often as mutko 

00:04:18.190 --> 00:04:22.630

00:04:34.810 --> 00:04:40.960
 single player playing position 

00:04:38.229 --> 00:04:43.030
 inside for example you like the second one 

00:04:40.960 --> 00:04:45.729
 play in a private house and huge 

00:04:43.030 --> 00:04:46.360
 the number of course mixes that is with 

00:04:45.729 --> 00:04:48.520
 practice 

00:04:46.360 --> 00:04:50.380
 the only way guys i am against boosters 

00:04:48.520 --> 00:04:52.660

00:04:50.380 --> 00:04:54.669
 I myself am and as understood from 

00:04:52.660 --> 00:04:56.680
 some of my phrases i just said 

00:04:54.669 --> 00:04:58.690
 my opinion that I see in those who let 

00:04:56.680 --> 00:05:02.020
 that's all and agree with this opinion 

00:04:58.690 --> 00:05:03.370
 or do not accept it say it all 

00:05:02.020 --> 00:05:04.450
 don't drive like that just 

00:05:03.370 --> 00:05:07.690
 professional player and you can not 

00:05:04.450 --> 00:05:10.600
 rise faith forces no yes at least 

00:05:07.690 --> 00:05:12.550

00:05:10.600 --> 00:05:14.139

 like subscribe to the channel and more 

00:05:14.139 --> 00:05:19.720

 really raised the title you write 

00:05:19.720 --> 00:05:23.919
 which one for example and the same 

00:05:22.150 --> 00:05:25.990
 the most possible drive and evil in the board that 

00:05:23.919 --> 00:05:28.810
 just did not look and realized that it 

00:05:25.990 --> 00:05:30.370
 maybe I ask the guys without a lie seriously 

00:05:28.810 --> 00:05:31.960
 let's just honestly write from not 

00:05:30.370 --> 00:05:33.970
 can understand and write can not understand 

00:05:31.960 --> 00:05:37.080
