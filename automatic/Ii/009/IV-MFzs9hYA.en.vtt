reviewing<00:00:12.030> the<00:00:12.420> SM<00:00:12.780> 50<00:00:13.230> I<00:00:13.259> seen<00:00:13.860> now<00:00:15.139> it<00:00:16.139> might

00:00:16.340 --> 00:00:16.350 
reviewing the SM 50 I seen now it might

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:18.439 
reviewing the SM 50 I seen now it might
look<00:00:16.410> a<00:00:16.590> little<00:00:16.740> small<00:00:17.100> and<00:00:17.940> that's<00:00:18.119> because

00:00:18.439 --> 00:00:18.449 
look a little small and that's because

00:00:18.449 --> 00:00:22.570 
look a little small and that's because
it<00:00:18.570> is<00:00:18.720> this<00:00:19.500> unit<00:00:19.920> is<00:00:20.160> meant<00:00:20.430> for<00:00:21.109> offices

00:00:22.570 --> 00:00:22.580 
it is this unit is meant for offices

it is this unit is meant for offices
very<00:00:23.580> small<00:00:24.150> I<00:00:24.510> see<00:00:24.840> use<00:00:25.170> applications<00:00:26.150> we

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:27.150 
very small I see use applications we

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:29.720 
very small I see use applications we
carried<00:00:27.510> has<00:00:27.660> been<00:00:27.869> very<00:00:28.109> very<00:00:28.199> popular<00:00:28.890> this

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:29.730 
carried has been very very popular this

00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:36.570 
offices in reviewing this unit we found

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:38.450 
offices in reviewing this unit we found
that<00:00:36.750> it<00:00:36.840> produces<00:00:37.200> ice<00:00:37.410> great<00:00:37.860> as<00:00:38.100> all<00:00:38.280> men

00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:38.460 
that it produces ice great as all men

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:41.299 
that it produces ice great as all men
and<00:00:38.550> to<00:00:38.610> art<00:00:38.790> machines<00:00:39.149> seem<00:00:39.690> to<00:00:39.809> do<00:00:40.129> it<00:00:41.129> also

00:00:41.299 --> 00:00:41.309 
and to art machines seem to do it also

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:42.740 
and to art machines seem to do it also
is<00:00:41.610> very<00:00:41.670> efficient<00:00:42.329> for<00:00:42.420> the<00:00:42.540> Tier<00:00:42.719> one

00:00:42.740 --> 00:00:42.750 
is very efficient for the Tier one

fifty three pounds for 24 hours the bin
holds<00:00:49.800> 25<00:00:50.610> pounds<00:00:51.210> and<00:00:52.010> some<00:00:53.010> of<00:00:53.070> the<00:00:53.160> neat

00:00:53.299 --> 00:00:53.309 
holds 25 pounds and some of the neat

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:57.229 
holds 25 pounds and some of the neat
features<00:00:53.520> that<00:00:53.940> we<00:00:54.180> saw<00:00:54.390> in<00:00:54.660> this<00:00:54.870> is<00:00:56.149> when<00:00:57.149> the

00:00:57.229 --> 00:00:57.239 
features that we saw in this is when the

00:00:57.239 --> 00:00:59.630 
features that we saw in this is when the
first<00:00:57.420> things<00:00:57.600> I<00:00:57.719> noticed<00:00:58.160> it<00:00:59.160> has<00:00:59.280> a<00:00:59.309> built<00:00:59.550> in

00:00:59.630 --> 00:00:59.640 
first things I noticed it has a built in

first things I noticed it has a built in
the<00:00:59.789> filter<00:01:00.090> system<00:01:00.510> filtering<00:01:01.109> your<00:01:01.260> eyes<00:01:01.410> is

00:01:01.729 --> 00:01:01.739 
the filter system filtering your eyes is

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:03.889 
the filter system filtering your eyes is
very<00:01:01.800> very<00:01:02.370> important<00:01:02.879> the<00:01:03.210> more<00:01:03.359> you<00:01:03.510> filter

00:01:03.889 --> 00:01:03.899 
very very important the more you filter

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:06.219 
very very important the more you filter
most<00:01:04.769> often<00:01:05.159> the<00:01:05.280> less<00:01:05.430> you<00:01:05.549> have<00:01:05.640> to<00:01:05.700> clean

00:01:06.219 --> 00:01:06.229 
most often the less you have to clean

00:01:06.229 --> 00:01:08.120 
most often the less you have to clean
the<00:01:07.229> other<00:01:07.320> thing<00:01:07.560> that<00:01:07.590> we<00:01:07.770> really<00:01:08.100> really

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:08.130 
the other thing that we really really

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:11.240 
the other thing that we really really
liked<00:01:08.520> about<00:01:08.640> this<00:01:08.939> is<00:01:09.360> for<00:01:10.130> applications<00:01:11.130> in

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:11.250 
liked about this is for applications in

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:13.670 
liked about this is for applications in
a<00:01:11.340> boardroom<00:01:11.869> conference<00:01:12.869> rooms<00:01:13.170> and<00:01:13.560> that

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:13.680 
a boardroom conference rooms and that

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:15.410 
a boardroom conference rooms and that
type<00:01:13.860> of<00:01:13.890> thing<00:01:14.189> there's<00:01:14.850> actually<00:01:15.210> a<00:01:15.270> machine

00:01:15.410 --> 00:01:15.420 
type of thing there's actually a machine

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:18.469 
type of thing there's actually a machine
delay<00:01:15.990> and<00:01:16.470> what<00:01:17.159> Manitowoc<00:01:17.729> learned<00:01:18.030> through

00:01:18.469 --> 00:01:18.479 
delay and what Manitowoc learned through

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:21.530 
delay and what Manitowoc learned through
feedback<00:01:18.720> from<00:01:19.170> their<00:01:19.380> users<00:01:19.740> is<00:01:20.130> that<00:01:20.729> in<00:01:21.330> the

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:21.540 
feedback from their users is that in the

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:23.870 
feedback from their users is that in the
boardroom<00:01:22.049> they<00:01:22.890> want<00:01:23.130> to<00:01:23.189> be<00:01:23.310> able<00:01:23.400> to<00:01:23.610> stop

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:23.880 
boardroom they want to be able to stop

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:26.090 
boardroom they want to be able to stop
the<00:01:24.060> compressor<00:01:24.570> noise<00:01:24.780> for<00:01:25.530> conference

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:26.100 
the compressor noise for conference

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:28.550 
the compressor noise for conference
calls<00:01:26.330> so<00:01:27.330> they<00:01:27.720> went<00:01:27.900> ahead<00:01:27.960> and<00:01:28.170> built<00:01:28.290> this

00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:28.560 
calls so they went ahead and built this

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:31.910 
calls so they went ahead and built this
into<00:01:29.479> as<00:01:30.479> an<00:01:30.689> application<00:01:31.229> into<00:01:31.380> this<00:01:31.560> unit

00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:31.920 
into as an application into this unit

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:34.370 
into as an application into this unit
you<00:01:32.490> hit<00:01:32.759> the<00:01:32.850> button<00:01:33.150> it'll<00:01:33.630> go<00:01:33.780> on<00:01:33.930> hold<00:01:34.140> for

you hit the button it'll go on hold for

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:36.920 
you hit the button it'll go on hold for
a<00:01:34.409> period<00:01:34.710> of<00:01:34.740> time<00:01:35.659> theoretically<00:01:36.659> enough

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:36.930 
a period of time theoretically enough

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:39.590 
a period of time theoretically enough
time<00:01:37.140> to<00:01:37.610> have<00:01:38.610> your<00:01:38.820> conference<00:01:39.090> call<00:01:39.210> and

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:39.600 
time to have your conference call and

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:42.679 
time to have your conference call and
it'll<00:01:40.500> reason<00:01:40.710> of<00:01:40.829> ice<00:01:40.979> production<00:01:41.390> now<00:01:42.390> why

00:01:42.679 --> 00:01:42.689 
it'll reason of ice production now why

00:01:42.689 --> 00:01:44.109 
it'll reason of ice production now why
do<00:01:42.750> that<00:01:42.990> instead<00:01:43.229> of<00:01:43.290> just<00:01:43.500> an<00:01:43.590> on/off<00:01:43.920> switch

00:01:44.109 --> 00:01:44.119 
do that instead of just an on/off switch

00:01:44.119 --> 00:01:48.020 
do that instead of just an on/off switch
and<00:01:45.119> what<00:01:45.270> we<00:01:45.390> found<00:01:45.600> in<00:01:46.020> feedback<00:01:46.460> is<00:01:47.460> from

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:48.030 
and what we found in feedback is from

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:50.749 
and what we found in feedback is from
Manitowoc<00:01:48.390> that<00:01:48.899> the<00:01:49.710> unit<00:01:50.070> would<00:01:50.430> never<00:01:50.610> be

00:01:50.749 --> 00:01:50.759 
Manitowoc that the unit would never be

00:01:50.759 --> 00:01:52.880 
Manitowoc that the unit would never be
turned<00:01:50.939> back<00:01:51.119> on<00:01:51.270> again<00:01:51.450> so<00:01:51.869> the<00:01:52.530> next<00:01:52.740> day

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:52.890 
turned back on again so the next day

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:54.679 
turned back on again so the next day
groups<00:01:53.220> that<00:01:53.340> people<00:01:53.490> be<00:01:53.790> ready<00:01:54.030> to<00:01:54.210> have<00:01:54.360> ice

00:01:54.679 --> 00:01:54.689 
groups that people be ready to have ice

00:01:54.689 --> 00:01:56.660 
groups that people be ready to have ice
in<00:01:54.720> their<00:01:54.990> beverage<00:01:55.259> and<00:01:55.500> there<00:01:55.799> is<00:01:55.979> no<00:01:56.130> ice<00:01:56.340> so

00:01:56.660 --> 00:01:56.670 
in their beverage and there is no ice so

00:01:56.670 --> 00:01:58.370 
in their beverage and there is no ice so
pretty<00:01:57.149> smart<00:01:57.450> thing<00:01:57.659> I<00:01:57.840> think

00:01:58.370 --> 00:01:58.380 
pretty smart thing I think

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:02.450 
pretty smart thing I think
or<00:01:59.270> mandatory<00:02:00.270> to<00:02:00.570> have<00:02:00.660> created<00:02:01.220> other<00:02:02.220> than

or mandatory to have created other than
that<00:02:02.640> very<00:02:02.940> simple<00:02:03.330> to<00:02:03.450> operate<00:02:03.480> it's<00:02:04.080> a<00:02:04.110> very

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:04.290 
that very simple to operate it's a very

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:05.840 
that very simple to operate it's a very
quiet<00:02:04.530> machine<00:02:05.040> but<00:02:05.370> it<00:02:05.460> is<00:02:05.580> quite<00:02:05.790> a

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:05.850 
quiet machine but it is quite a

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:08.420 
quiet machine but it is quite a
workhorse<00:02:06.270> great<00:02:06.930> for<00:02:07.200> small<00:02:07.440> offices<00:02:07.950> even<00:02:08.369> a

00:02:08.420 --> 00:02:08.430 
workhorse great for small offices even a

00:02:08.430 --> 00:02:17.400
