half way across on the sides there is a
little<00:04:04.489> vent<00:04:04.670> here<00:04:04.940> but<00:04:05.630> there's<00:04:05.930> a<00:04:06.019> -<00:04:06.560> I<00:04:06.950> guess

00:04:07.330 --> 00:04:07.340 
little vent here but there's a - I guess

00:04:07.340 --> 00:04:09.759 
little vent here but there's a - I guess
you<00:04:07.430> call<00:04:07.640> them<00:04:07.760> volume<00:04:08.269> adjusting<00:04:08.900> for<00:04:09.620> your

00:04:09.759 --> 00:04:09.769 
you call them volume adjusting for your

00:04:09.769 --> 00:04:13.589 
you call them volume adjusting for your
waist<00:04:09.980> snaps

00:04:13.589 --> 00:04:13.599 

00:04:13.599 --> 00:04:19.080

and then flipping it over completely you

00:04:19.090 --> 00:04:21.210 
and then flipping it over completely you
have<00:04:19.329> it's<00:04:19.750> really<00:04:19.989> just<00:04:20.079> the<00:04:20.470> stripe<00:04:20.859> itself
