00:00:14.450 --> 00:00:16.910 

well<00:00:15.450> I<00:00:15.480> think<00:00:15.570> there's<00:00:15.900> a<00:00:15.959> lot<00:00:16.199> of<00:00:16.230> challenges

00:00:16.910 --> 00:00:16.920 
well I think there's a lot of challenges

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:19.580 
well I think there's a lot of challenges
for<00:00:17.189> any<00:00:17.400> major<00:00:17.730> but<00:00:18.240> for<00:00:18.509> psychology<00:00:19.199> majors

00:00:19.580 --> 00:00:19.590 
for any major but for psychology majors

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:21.440 
for any major but for psychology majors
it's<00:00:19.830> probably<00:00:20.400> that<00:00:20.580> your<00:00:20.820> interest<00:00:21.270> is<00:00:21.419> in

00:00:21.440 --> 00:00:21.450 
it's probably that your interest is in

00:00:21.450 --> 00:00:24.409 
it's probably that your interest is in
the<00:00:21.840> human<00:00:22.169> blood<00:00:22.349> and<00:00:22.800> how<00:00:23.460> it<00:00:23.640> reacts<00:00:24.000> in

00:00:24.409 --> 00:00:24.419 
the human blood and how it reacts in

00:00:24.419 --> 00:00:28.100 
the human blood and how it reacts in
certain<00:00:25.230> instances<00:00:25.740> and<00:00:26.099> a<00:00:26.669> lot<00:00:27.660> of<00:00:27.779> different

00:00:28.100 --> 00:00:28.110 
certain instances and a lot of different

00:00:28.110 --> 00:00:30.019 
certain instances and a lot of different
instances<00:00:28.559> so<00:00:28.800> I<00:00:28.829> think<00:00:29.160> that<00:00:29.309> sometimes<00:00:29.550> we

00:00:30.019 --> 00:00:30.029 
instances so I think that sometimes we

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:32.540 
instances so I think that sometimes we
can<00:00:30.239> overthink<00:00:31.230> what<00:00:31.919> we're<00:00:32.099> doing<00:00:32.399> in

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:32.550 
can overthink what we're doing in

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:35.180 
can overthink what we're doing in
psychology<00:00:33.210> but<00:00:33.780> we<00:00:33.930> can<00:00:34.170> also<00:00:34.290> under<00:00:34.950> think

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:35.190 
psychology but we can also under think

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:37.670 
psychology but we can also under think
what<00:00:35.460> we're<00:00:35.610> doing<00:00:35.940> in<00:00:36.059> psychology<00:00:36.750> and<00:00:36.989> maybe

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:37.680 
what we're doing in psychology and maybe

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:39.470 
what we're doing in psychology and maybe
come<00:00:37.950> to<00:00:38.100> their<00:00:38.219> own<00:00:38.250> conclusions<00:00:39.000> so<00:00:39.180> I<00:00:39.239> think

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:39.480 
come to their own conclusions so I think

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:42.110 
come to their own conclusions so I think
there's<00:00:40.350> so<00:00:40.590> much<00:00:40.620> of<00:00:41.160> it<00:00:41.309> sometimes<00:00:41.850> we<00:00:42.000> have

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:42.120 
there's so much of it sometimes we have

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:50.210 
there's so much of it sometimes we have
to<00:00:42.270> be<00:00:42.360> able<00:00:42.480> to<00:00:42.870> focus<00:00:48.860> if<00:00:49.860> you<00:00:49.980> take

00:00:50.210 --> 00:00:50.220 
to be able to focus if you take

00:00:50.220 --> 00:00:51.380 
to be able to focus if you take
psychology<00:00:50.790> as<00:00:50.850> a<00:00:50.910> major
