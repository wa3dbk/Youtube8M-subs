eyeshadow<00:04:08.580> I'm<00:04:09.060> just<00:04:09.690> tapping<00:04:10.140> that<00:04:10.430> to<00:04:11.430> the

00:04:11.540 --> 00:04:11.550 
eyeshadow I'm just tapping that to the

00:04:11.550 --> 00:04:15.050 
eyeshadow I'm just tapping that to the
inner<00:04:11.730> and<00:04:12.060> outer<00:04:12.690> corner<00:04:13.550> to<00:04:14.550> get<00:04:14.730> a<00:04:14.760> little

00:04:15.050 --> 00:04:15.060 
inner and outer corner to get a little

00:04:15.060 --> 00:04:20.150 
inner and outer corner to get a little
bit<00:04:15.210> more<00:04:15.540> darkness<00:04:16.440> in<00:04:16.950> there<00:04:17.640> I<00:04:18.380> find<00:04:19.380> it<00:04:19.530> if

00:04:20.150 --> 00:04:20.160 
bit more darkness in there I find it if

00:04:20.160 --> 00:04:22.340 
bit more darkness in there I find it if
you<00:04:20.430> apply<00:04:20.910> the<00:04:20.970> right<00:04:21.330> amount<00:04:21.390> with<00:04:22.019> a<00:04:22.049> very

00:04:22.340 --> 00:04:22.350 
you apply the right amount with a very

00:04:22.350 --> 00:04:25.000 
you apply the right amount with a very
soft<00:04:22.680> brush<00:04:23.070> they're<00:04:23.700> really<00:04:24.300> comfortable

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:25.010 
soft brush they're really comfortable

00:04:25.010 --> 00:04:27.500 
soft brush they're really comfortable
because<00:04:26.010> it's<00:04:26.310> a<00:04:26.400> prolonged<00:04:26.850> wearing<00:04:26.970> product

00:04:27.500 --> 00:04:27.510 
because it's a prolonged wearing product

00:04:27.510 --> 00:04:29.570 
because it's a prolonged wearing product
if<00:04:27.660> there's<00:04:27.840> too<00:04:28.080> much<00:04:28.110> on<00:04:28.560> you'll<00:04:29.160> feel<00:04:29.430> it

00:04:29.570 --> 00:04:29.580 
if there's too much on you'll feel it

00:04:29.580 --> 00:04:31.340 
if there's too much on you'll feel it
it'll<00:04:29.880> feel<00:04:30.120> like<00:04:30.420> it's<00:04:30.600> a<00:04:30.690> little<00:04:30.960> bit<00:04:31.080> tight

00:04:31.340 --> 00:04:31.350 
it'll feel like it's a little bit tight

00:04:31.350 --> 00:04:34.670 
it'll feel like it's a little bit tight
but<00:04:31.620> it's<00:04:32.280> if<00:04:32.850> you<00:04:33.450> do<00:04:33.690> it<00:04:33.810> in<00:04:33.900> a<00:04:34.020> sheer<00:04:34.350> way

00:04:34.670 --> 00:04:34.680 
but it's if you do it in a sheer way

00:04:34.680 --> 00:04:37.640 
but it's if you do it in a sheer way
it's<00:04:35.610> absolutely<00:04:36.450> worth<00:04:36.630> it<00:04:36.900> so<00:04:37.260> I<00:04:37.320> don't<00:04:37.500> want
