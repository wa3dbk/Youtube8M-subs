English it's boring we end up with an
overpowered<00:01:57.719> England<00:01:58.079> team<00:01:58.229> so<00:01:59.100> when<00:01:59.369> I<00:01:59.399> am

00:01:59.749 --> 00:01:59.759 
overpowered England team so when I am

00:01:59.759 --> 00:02:02.120 
overpowered England team so when I am
picking<00:02:00.180> the<00:02:00.479> the<00:02:00.990> players<00:02:01.200> although<00:02:01.710> it<00:02:02.009> will

00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:02.130 
picking the the players although it will

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:04.190 
picking the the players although it will
be<00:02:02.310> random<00:02:02.729> I<00:02:02.850> will<00:02:02.969> try<00:02:03.240> and<00:02:03.390> make<00:02:03.540> sure<00:02:03.840> it's

00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:04.200 
be random I will try and make sure it's

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:07.880 
be random I will try and make sure it's
a<00:02:04.380> broad<00:02:04.710> spectrum<00:02:05.159> of<00:02:06.560> nationalities<00:02:07.560> and

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:07.890 
a broad spectrum of nationalities and

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:11.449 
a broad spectrum of nationalities and
positions<00:02:09.560> simply<00:02:10.560> because<00:02:10.860> otherwise<00:02:11.099> it's

00:02:11.449 --> 00:02:11.459 
positions simply because otherwise it's

00:02:11.459 --> 00:02:13.610 
positions simply because otherwise it's
a<00:02:11.550> bit<00:02:11.670> boring<00:02:11.849> or<00:02:12.150> all<00:02:12.360> the<00:02:12.510> same

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:13.620 
a bit boring or all the same

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:17.210 
a bit boring or all the same
so<00:02:14.150> although<00:02:15.150> it'd<00:02:15.209> be<00:02:15.360> random<00:02:15.780> if<00:02:16.739> a

00:02:17.210 --> 00:02:17.220 
so although it'd be random if a

your details to me before then and then

00:04:19.470 --> 00:04:22.219 
your details to me before then and then
I'll<00:04:19.919> put<00:04:20.099> you<00:04:20.160> in<00:04:20.190> a<00:04:20.310> hat<00:04:20.489> and<00:04:21.049> probably<00:04:22.049> pick

00:04:22.219 --> 00:04:22.229 
I'll put you in a hat and probably pick

00:04:22.229 --> 00:04:23.870 
I'll put you in a hat and probably pick
you<00:04:22.620> know<00:04:22.740> three<00:04:23.010> keepers<00:04:23.370> if<00:04:23.520> you<00:04:23.610> defend

00:04:23.870 --> 00:04:23.880 
you know three keepers if you defend

00:04:23.880 --> 00:04:25.399 
you know three keepers if you defend
those<00:04:24.090> few<00:04:24.270> midfielders<00:04:24.750> few<00:04:25.110> wingers<00:04:25.380> and

00:04:25.399 --> 00:04:25.409 
those few midfielders few wingers and

00:04:25.409 --> 00:04:26.780 
those few midfielders few wingers and
strikers<00:04:25.979> probably

00:04:26.780 --> 00:04:26.790 
strikers probably

00:04:26.790 --> 00:04:29.110 
strikers probably
we<00:04:26.910> lean<00:04:27.870> towards<00:04:28.260> more<00:04:28.440> attacking<00:04:28.710> players

00:04:29.110 --> 00:04:29.120 
we lean towards more attacking players

00:04:29.120 --> 00:04:31.460 
we lean towards more attacking players
but<00:04:30.120> I<00:04:30.150> guess<00:04:30.420> most<00:04:30.720> of<00:04:30.840> you<00:04:30.990> will<00:04:31.110> pick<00:04:31.260> those

00:04:31.460 --> 00:04:31.470 
but I guess most of you will pick those

00:04:31.470 --> 00:04:32.990 
but I guess most of you will pick those
anyway<00:04:31.830> so<00:04:31.890> perhaps<00:04:32.250> those<00:04:32.460> of<00:04:32.490> you<00:04:32.730> that<00:04:32.820> do

00:04:32.990 --> 00:04:33.000 
anyway so perhaps those of you that do

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:34.490 
anyway so perhaps those of you that do
pick<00:04:33.180> go<00:04:33.360> keyboard<00:04:33.750> offense<00:04:34.080> have<00:04:34.260> more

00:04:34.490 --> 00:04:34.500 
pick go keyboard offense have more

00:04:34.500 --> 00:04:36.740 
pick go keyboard offense have more
chance<00:04:34.770> of<00:04:34.890> getting<00:04:34.950> into<00:04:35.490> it<00:04:35.610> so<00:04:36.330> maybe<00:04:36.510> look

00:04:36.740 --> 00:04:36.750 
chance of getting into it so maybe look

00:04:36.750 --> 00:04:38.150 
chance of getting into it so maybe look
at<00:04:36.840> people's<00:04:37.110> comments<00:04:37.290> if<00:04:37.530> you<00:04:37.620> really<00:04:38.010> want

00:04:38.150 --> 00:04:38.160 
at people's comments if you really want

00:04:38.160 --> 00:04:39.590 
at people's comments if you really want
to<00:04:38.250> get<00:04:38.340> into<00:04:38.670> it<00:04:38.790> just<00:04:39.180> pick<00:04:39.360> something

00:04:39.590 --> 00:04:39.600 
to get into it just pick something

00:04:39.600 --> 00:04:42.350 
to get into it just pick something
completely<00:04:40.260> obscure<00:04:41.000> and<00:04:42.000> they're<00:04:42.180> more

00:04:42.350 --> 00:04:42.360 
completely obscure and they're more

00:04:42.360 --> 00:04:43.940 
completely obscure and they're more
likely<00:04:42.570> to<00:04:42.810> pick<00:04:43.170> you<00:04:43.350> I<00:04:43.410> know<00:04:43.500> it's<00:04:43.740> random

00:04:43.940 --> 00:04:43.950 
likely to pick you I know it's random

00:04:43.950 --> 00:04:47.360 
likely to pick you I know it's random
but<00:04:44.490> like<00:04:44.910> I<00:04:45.060> said<00:04:45.560> nationality<00:04:46.560> position

00:04:47.360 --> 00:04:47.370 
but like I said nationality position

00:04:47.370 --> 00:04:49.640 
but like I said nationality position
wise<00:04:47.610> I<00:04:47.940> want<00:04:48.570> to<00:04:48.780> make<00:04:48.960> sure<00:04:49.140> there's<00:04:49.350> a<00:04:49.410> broad

00:04:49.640 --> 00:04:49.650 
wise I want to make sure there's a broad

00:04:49.650 --> 00:04:52.820 
wise I want to make sure there's a broad
spectrum<00:04:50.630> and<00:04:51.630> probably<00:04:52.470> two<00:04:52.650> or<00:04:52.680> three

00:04:52.820 --> 00:04:52.830 
spectrum and probably two or three

00:04:52.830 --> 00:04:55.700 
spectrum and probably two or three
