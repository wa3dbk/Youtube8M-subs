experiment<00:00:27.150> under<00:00:27.570> the<00:00:27.689> same<00:00:27.990> conditions<00:00:28.680> I

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:28.890 
experiment under the same conditions I

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:33.139 
experiment under the same conditions I
used<00:00:29.369> very<00:00:29.519> similar<00:00:30.260> or<00:00:31.260> maybe<00:00:31.320> the<00:00:31.830> same<00:00:32.149> fan

00:00:33.139 --> 00:00:33.149 
used very similar or maybe the same fan

00:00:33.149 --> 00:00:37.280 
used very similar or maybe the same fan
cooler<00:00:33.540> it<00:00:34.050> has<00:00:34.200> four<00:00:35.270> electric<00:00:36.270> coils<00:00:36.750> which

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:37.290 
cooler it has four electric coils which

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:40.610 
cooler it has four electric coils which
are<00:00:37.440> this<00:00:37.649> direction<00:00:38.160> it<00:00:38.309> was<00:00:39.110> this<00:00:40.110> direction

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:40.620 
are this direction it was this direction

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:43.160 
are this direction it was this direction
is<00:00:40.739> one<00:00:40.950> way<00:00:41.160> one<00:00:41.879> direction<00:00:42.329> this<00:00:42.570> way<00:00:42.780> this

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:43.170 
is one way one direction this way this

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:45.770 
is one way one direction this way this
way<00:00:43.440> this<00:00:43.469> way<00:00:43.710> so<00:00:44.399> it's<00:00:44.579> always<00:00:44.789> an<00:00:45.360> elected

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:45.780 
way this way so it's always an elected

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:49.069 
way this way so it's always an elected
in<00:00:45.930> the<00:00:46.079> middle<00:00:46.379> of<00:00:46.559> the<00:00:47.070> fan<00:00:47.430> color<00:00:47.840> so<00:00:48.840> I'll

00:00:49.069 --> 00:00:49.079 
in the middle of the fan color so I'll

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:52.220 
in the middle of the fan color so I'll
use<00:00:49.230> this<00:00:49.440> pen<00:00:49.860> color<00:00:50.100> this<00:00:50.579> for<00:00:51.230> neodymium

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:52.230 
use this pen color this for neodymium

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:53.720 
use this pen color this for neodymium
magnets<00:00:52.559> these<00:00:52.739> are<00:00:52.800> really<00:00:53.190> very<00:00:53.399> strong

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:53.730 
magnets these are really very strong

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:56.810 
magnets these are really very strong
language<00:00:53.879> on<00:00:54.210> the<00:00:54.300> market<00:00:54.750> and<00:00:55.550> one<00:00:56.550> of<00:00:56.670> the

00:00:56.810 --> 00:00:56.820 
language on the market and one of the

00:00:56.820 --> 00:01:02.150 
language on the market and one of the
strongest<00:00:57.270> and<00:00:58.160> this<00:00:59.160> is<00:00:59.280> it<00:00:59.430> first<00:01:00.920> let's<00:01:01.920> try

00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:02.160 
strongest and this is it first let's try

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:04.969 
strongest and this is it first let's try
that<00:01:02.820> the<00:01:03.059> fan<00:01:03.570> cooler<00:01:03.930> is<00:01:04.229> operating

00:01:04.969 --> 00:01:04.979 
that the fan cooler is operating

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:09.260 
that the fan cooler is operating
properly<00:01:05.390> so<00:01:06.390> let's<00:01:06.689> put<00:01:07.650> the<00:01:08.280> wires<00:01:08.820> on

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:09.270 
properly so let's put the wires on

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:12.710 
properly so let's put the wires on
battery<00:01:10.189> okay<00:01:11.189> we<00:01:11.400> can<00:01:11.610> see<00:01:11.850> that<00:01:12.510> there<00:01:12.689> is

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:12.720 
battery okay we can see that there is

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:16.249 
battery okay we can see that there is
rotation<00:01:13.439> it<00:01:14.070> is<00:01:14.130> no<00:01:14.369> problem<00:01:14.850> it<00:01:15.540> is<00:01:15.780> working

00:01:16.249 --> 00:01:16.259 
rotation it is no problem it is working

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:18.820 
rotation it is no problem it is working
properly<00:01:16.890> it<00:01:17.280> is<00:01:17.340> not<00:01:17.520> broken

00:01:18.820 --> 00:01:18.830 
properly it is not broken

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:21.620 
properly it is not broken
okay<00:01:19.830> so<00:01:20.100> this<00:01:20.220> was<00:01:20.430> the<00:01:20.549> first<00:01:20.790> test<00:01:21.030> the

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:21.630 
okay so this was the first test the

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:24.020 
okay so this was the first test the
second<00:01:21.990> test<00:01:22.200> let's<00:01:22.590> try<00:01:22.860> to<00:01:22.920> do<00:01:23.159> it<00:01:23.189> with<00:01:23.490> just

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:24.030 
second test let's try to do it with just

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:26.510 
second test let's try to do it with just
first<00:01:24.390> with<00:01:24.810> just<00:01:24.840> two<00:01:25.200> magnets<00:01:25.590> if<00:01:26.310> it's

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:26.520 
first with just two magnets if it's

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:29.270 
first with just two magnets if it's
operating<00:01:27.180> with<00:01:27.600> four<00:01:28.140> magnets<00:01:28.530> yes<00:01:29.040> it

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:29.280 
operating with four magnets yes it

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:30.920 
operating with four magnets yes it
should<00:01:29.490> also<00:01:29.700> operate<00:01:30.210> with<00:01:30.450> only<00:01:30.659> two

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:30.930 
should also operate with only two

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:33.679 
should also operate with only two
magnets<00:01:31.290> when<00:01:32.189> I<00:01:32.220> put<00:01:32.549> these<00:01:33.150> two<00:01:33.360> magnets

00:01:33.679 --> 00:01:33.689 
magnets when I put these two magnets

00:01:33.689 --> 00:01:36.710 
magnets when I put these two magnets
here<00:01:33.990> you<00:01:34.470> see<00:01:34.710> there<00:01:35.159> is<00:01:35.280> no<00:01:35.430> rotation<00:01:35.579> I<00:01:36.119> put

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:36.720 
here you see there is no rotation I put

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:38.390 
here you see there is no rotation I put
different<00:01:36.840> side<00:01:37.380> of<00:01:37.409> the<00:01:37.619> magnetic<00:01:38.070> different

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:38.400 
different side of the magnetic different

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:40.819 
different side of the magnetic different
poles<00:01:38.670> also<00:01:39.540> no<00:01:39.869> rotation<00:01:40.380> dependent

00:01:40.819 --> 00:01:40.829 
poles also no rotation dependent

00:01:40.829 --> 00:01:43.490 
poles also no rotation dependent
different<00:01:41.250> both<00:01:41.460> of<00:01:41.670> these<00:01:41.820> magnets<00:01:42.290> also<00:01:43.290> not

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:43.500 
different both of these magnets also not

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:46.850 
different both of these magnets also not
knots<00:01:44.340> are<00:01:44.610> not<00:01:44.850> circulating<00:01:45.659> nothing<00:01:46.110> no<00:01:46.560> fan

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:46.860 
knots are not circulating nothing no fan

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:49.969 
knots are not circulating nothing no fan
nothing<00:01:47.520> no<00:01:47.820> rotation<00:01:48.420> if<00:01:49.140> I<00:01:49.290> put<00:01:49.500> it<00:01:49.590> this<00:01:49.619> way

00:01:49.969 --> 00:01:49.979 
nothing no rotation if I put it this way

00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:52.280 
nothing no rotation if I put it this way
this<00:01:50.369> way<00:01:50.640> no<00:01:51.000> rotation<00:01:51.509> so<00:01:51.750> with<00:01:51.930> two<00:01:52.079> magnets

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:52.290 
this way no rotation so with two magnets

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:55.160 
this way no rotation so with two magnets
it<00:01:52.619> is<00:01:52.770> definitely<00:01:53.399> not<00:01:53.549> working<00:01:54.299> let's<00:01:54.930> try

00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:55.170

fourth<00:02:15.500> magnet<00:02:16.120> okay<00:02:17.120> it's<00:02:17.600> not<00:02:17.840> cooling

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:18.190 
fourth magnet okay it's not cooling

00:02:18.190 --> 00:02:21.610 
fourth magnet okay it's not cooling
before<00:02:19.190> I<00:02:19.220> try<00:02:19.670> it<00:02:19.730> before<00:02:20.150> I<00:02:20.690> try<00:02:21.020> it<00:02:21.050> with<00:02:21.380> all

00:02:21.610 --> 00:02:21.620 
before I try it before I try it with all

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:24.310 
before I try it before I try it with all
four<00:02:21.980> magnets<00:02:22.280> from<00:02:22.610> all<00:02:22.820> sides<00:02:23.120> of<00:02:23.960> the

00:02:24.310 --> 00:02:24.320 
four magnets from all sides of the

00:02:24.320 --> 00:02:26.260 
four magnets from all sides of the
magnets<00:02:24.710> I<00:02:24.920> tried<00:02:25.250> all<00:02:25.520> the<00:02:25.700> variation

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:26.270 
magnets I tried all the variation

00:02:26.270 --> 00:02:29.020 
magnets I tried all the variation
combination<00:02:26.900> of<00:02:26.960> magnet<00:02:27.380> and<00:02:27.560> it<00:02:28.220> was<00:02:28.610> not

00:02:29.020 --> 00:02:29.030 
combination of magnet and it was not

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:34.750 
combination of magnet and it was not
sorry<00:02:29.990> it<00:02:30.770> was<00:02:31.370> not<00:02:31.840> rotating<00:02:33.100> so<00:02:34.100> it<00:02:34.430> was<00:02:34.610> not

00:02:34.750 --> 00:02:34.760 
sorry it was not rotating so it was not

00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:38.710 
sorry it was not rotating so it was not
working<00:02:36.250> therefore<00:02:37.250> less<00:02:38.240> I<00:02:38.360> was<00:02:38.540> very

00:02:38.710 --> 00:02:38.720 
working therefore less I was very

00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:40.750 
working therefore less I was very
interested<00:02:39.020> I<00:02:39.470> tried<00:02:39.770> also<00:02:40.190> all<00:02:40.400> other

00:02:40.750 --> 00:02:40.760 
interested I tried also all other

00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:43.090 
interested I tried also all other
possibilities<00:02:41.390> how<00:02:41.930> to<00:02:41.990> find<00:02:42.380> three<00:02:42.710> energy

00:02:43.090 --> 00:02:43.100 
possibilities how to find three energy

00:02:43.100 --> 00:02:45.550 
possibilities how to find three energy
magnet<00:02:43.430> motors<00:02:43.730> and<00:02:43.970> you<00:02:44.450> can<00:02:44.660> see<00:02:44.900> more

00:02:45.550 --> 00:02:45.560 
magnet motors and you can see more

00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:47.830 
magnet motors and you can see more
possibilities<00:02:46.370> on<00:02:46.580> my<00:02:46.790> website<00:02:47.210> which<00:02:47.690> are

00:02:47.830 --> 00:02:47.840 
possibilities on my website which are

00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:51.850 
possibilities on my website which are
probably<00:02:47.990> working<00:02:48.650> better<00:02:49.100> by
