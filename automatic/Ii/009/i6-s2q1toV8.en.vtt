00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:14.129
 hello very good kids everyone I am 

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:17.820
 working hand in gamers and today they 

00:00:14.129 --> 00:00:19.890
 I bring a video related to the 

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:22.470
 samsung galaxy s3 but that is worth to 

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:24.869
 all smartphones and I'll tell you 

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:27.119
 new little secret tricks that 

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:29.400
 they have these smartphones that are not very 

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:31.679
 known and that's why I want to 

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:35.190
 teach it the first thing that I'm going to 

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:37.890
 teach is going to be the function of axis or 

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:40.700
 also called on-the-go in English that 

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:43.790
 consists of a cable 

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:45.090
 on the one hand it is microusb to connect 

00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:48.030
 to the 

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:50.530
 to the mobile and on the other hand it is a female 

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:53.940
 of usb 

00:00:50.530 --> 00:00:57.300
 same thing what this cable does is 

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:59.860
 transform the phone into a host for 

00:00:57.300 --> 00:01:03.250
 other external devices as they can 

00:00:59.860 --> 00:01:07.170
 be a pendrive or more things now 

00:01:03.250 --> 00:01:10.450
 I'll teach, let's start with it 

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:12.670
 down in the description I will put a 

00:01:10.450 --> 00:01:16.450
 small a small list with all the 

00:01:12.670 --> 00:01:19.180
 smartphones that have otg function and 

00:01:16.450 --> 00:01:22.030
 well then what we simply have 

00:01:19.180 --> 00:01:24.330
 what to do is to connect the 

00:01:22.030 --> 00:01:27.740
 microusb 

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:32.070
 the phone and there we are just 

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:36.420
 connected usb connector and for example 

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:39.410
 we are going to increase a memory of 

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:39.410
 32 gigas 

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:45.050
 it will not come out here 

00:01:42.160 --> 00:01:47.840
 mazzeo storage usb connected voucher 

00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:50.540
 this right now is how a computer is 

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:52.040
 just like a computer is now 

00:01:50.540 --> 00:01:54.560
 himself is adjusting then the skewer 

00:01:52.040 --> 00:01:56.390
 good to see these open alone but what 

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:59.090
 what we have to do to see what 

00:01:56.390 --> 00:02:02.000
 we have on the skewer is to go to my 

00:01:59.090 --> 00:02:05.120
 files to all the files and here 

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:09.070
 we have is the external card the card 

00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:11.690
 the internal memory of the phone and the usb 

00:02:09.070 --> 00:02:13.850
 it's automatically going to create us 

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:18.350
 two folders one android call and another 

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:20.180
 iron king points forgiveness that 

00:02:18.350 --> 00:02:21.860
 the good you can remove any 

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:23.480
 moment but every time you connect it to 

00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:25.750
 phone you will appear those two 

00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:29.060
 folders folders good is also of 

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:31.670
 recycler that gets hidden but 

00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:34.670
 good and good, well, you can watch videos 

00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:36.920
 you can music photos or anything that 

00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:40.060
 you want, you can see it on the phone 

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:42.830
 perfectly is a photo whatever 

00:02:40.060 --> 00:02:45.530
 you can also watch videos the music that 

00:02:42.830 --> 00:02:47.300
 do you have that if the executable programs 

00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:48.330
 like games or anything like that 

00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:52.500
 do not 

00:02:48.330 --> 00:02:55.470
 unfortunately and well I'm going to 

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:57.690
 teach good when you go to 

00:02:55.470 --> 00:03:00.180
 disconnect it you have that it's like in the 

00:02:57.690 --> 00:03:02.610
 computer you have to extract it with 

00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:04.790
 security and now he will put there in insurance 

00:03:02.610 --> 00:03:06.560
 will be the device I think 

00:03:04.790 --> 00:03:09.550
 USB storage is brought with 

00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:11.710
 security then you can not take out 

00:03:09.550 --> 00:03:13.810
 and good also for example you can 

00:03:11.710 --> 00:03:15.880
 connect 

00:03:13.810 --> 00:03:17.950
 and larger hardware as per 

00:03:15.880 --> 00:03:20.739
 example a mouse or a keyboard here os 

00:03:17.950 --> 00:03:24.090
 I'm going to connect a mouse connected mouse 

00:03:20.739 --> 00:03:24.090
 here we have the mouse 

00:03:26.830 --> 00:03:34.690
 and automatically it will be created in the 

00:03:30.530 --> 00:03:39.410
 screen a small cursor like the 

00:03:34.690 --> 00:03:43.910
 computer that is used equally 

00:03:39.410 --> 00:03:46.069
 that the computer is worth you can perform the 

00:03:43.910 --> 00:03:49.050
 same activity as 

00:03:46.069 --> 00:03:51.570
 with touching on the screen 

00:03:49.050 --> 00:03:54.450
 the left button to select 

00:03:51.570 --> 00:03:57.800
 right button to go back through 

00:03:54.450 --> 00:03:57.800
 example if we can do something 

00:04:01.400 --> 00:04:08.780
 for example red pen 

00:04:05.680 --> 00:04:10.640
 and we can do everything we want 

00:04:08.780 --> 00:04:12.410
 we can also erase good writing 

00:04:10.640 --> 00:04:14.740
 we can also for example let's 

00:04:12.410 --> 00:04:14.740
 to write 

00:04:17.260 --> 00:04:20.260
 script 

00:04:20.799 --> 00:04:23.280
 Y 

00:04:26.800 --> 00:04:32.689
 a little but good that you know that this 

00:04:30.319 --> 00:04:34.760
 function is pretty good right button 

00:04:32.689 --> 00:04:37.720
 to go back 

00:04:34.760 --> 00:04:37.720
 awaiting 

00:04:38.360 --> 00:04:45.439
 well and good then another trick than another 

00:04:42.860 --> 00:04:47.990
 little trick that I wanted to show you this 

00:04:45.439 --> 00:04:49.580
 I think it does not have safe extraction no 

00:04:47.990 --> 00:04:53.060
 has safe extraction then 

00:04:49.580 --> 00:04:55.580
 we simply disconnect the bad from 

00:04:53.060 --> 00:04:58.870
 this of this function is your consumption of 

00:04:55.580 --> 00:05:01.280
 battery that is extraordinarily 

00:04:58.870 --> 00:05:05.870
 excessive for example connect a 

00:05:01.280 --> 00:05:07.310
 keyboard consumes a lot a lot and good another 

00:05:05.870 --> 00:05:12.469
 of the functions that I wanted to teach you 

00:05:07.310 --> 00:05:14.710
 of these smartphones with android is a 

00:05:12.469 --> 00:05:18.050
 application that is very well known but that 

00:05:14.710 --> 00:05:19.969
 It yields a lot with the function 

00:05:18.050 --> 00:05:22.460
 multifunction that has android that is 

00:05:19.969 --> 00:05:25.520
 so it is characterized that it is called 

00:05:22.460 --> 00:05:29.000
 as there you can see switch with the real 

00:05:25.520 --> 00:05:33.800
 final and good consists of an application 

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:34.939
 that creates a small link for us 

00:05:33.800 --> 00:05:39.370
 example let's open several 

00:05:34.939 --> 00:05:39.370
 applications that are left open 

00:05:41.110 --> 00:05:49.280
 and good what this application creates 

00:05:44.590 --> 00:05:52.540
 okay now I'm just teaching is 

00:05:49.280 --> 00:05:55.680
 with a small 

00:05:52.540 --> 00:05:55.680
 it's so he looked for it 

00:05:55.729 --> 00:06:03.850
 a small window 

00:05:59.880 --> 00:06:07.450
 That little thing that just came out there is worth 

00:06:03.850 --> 00:06:08.950
 that what is going to us what is 

00:06:07.450 --> 00:06:11.830
 indicating is that every time we perform 

00:06:08.950 --> 00:06:13.420
 so we will leave a small menu with 

00:06:11.830 --> 00:06:14.950
 the applications that we have good here 

00:06:13.420 --> 00:06:16.720
 we can adjust the sensitivity and everything 

00:06:14.950 --> 00:06:19.300
 what we most want to put it in the 

00:06:16.720 --> 00:06:20.530
 right on the left below good 

00:06:19.300 --> 00:06:22.450
 that 's with the edition but but already 

00:06:20.530 --> 00:06:25.660
 you know if you have a little bit of tomorrow 

00:06:22.450 --> 00:06:27.520
 you can hack perfectly, you can see 

00:06:25.660 --> 00:06:30.190
 that did not leave and before the margin not 

00:06:27.520 --> 00:06:33.340
 so now we activate here and you see no 

00:06:30.190 --> 00:06:34.420
 there is a small menu with all 

00:06:33.340 --> 00:06:35.140
 all the applications that we have 

00:06:34.420 --> 00:06:39.030
 open 

00:06:35.140 --> 00:06:39.030
 here it looks a bit 

00:06:39.150 --> 00:06:43.140
 if enough being in any 

00:06:41.460 --> 00:06:44.850
 example application send us a 

00:06:43.140 --> 00:06:47.710
 whatsapp for whatever and we want 

00:06:44.850 --> 00:06:50.050
 change we have here to change 

00:06:47.710 --> 00:06:52.480
 for example this old man would come back for 

00:06:50.050 --> 00:06:54.220
 here we can also change the 

00:06:52.480 --> 00:06:57.310
 sensitivity 

00:06:54.220 --> 00:06:59.140
 also change the size of the tab 

00:06:57.310 --> 00:07:01.060
 I put it there because if I put it here 

00:06:59.140 --> 00:07:03.070
 I'm over there with a lot of buttons 

00:07:01.060 --> 00:07:05.260
 of whatsapp such if I put it down with the 

00:07:03.070 --> 00:07:08.050
 keyboard so I 'd rather have it here 

00:07:05.260 --> 00:07:13.120
 for example is we can open any 

00:07:08.050 --> 00:07:15.580
 application is is a great application 

00:07:13.120 --> 00:07:17.680
 What it does to us is to squeeze 

00:07:15.580 --> 00:07:19.840
 maximum in the multifunction that you have 

00:07:17.680 --> 00:07:23.550
 Android to open to open different 

00:07:19.840 --> 00:07:23.550
 applications in one time 

00:07:27.820 --> 00:07:34.440
 and well, so far it has been everything 

00:07:30.560 --> 00:07:36.630
 kids thank you very much for watching 

00:07:34.440 --> 00:07:38.930
 and subscribe if you liked firewood 

00:07:36.630 --> 00:07:42.510
 like if you have any question comment 

00:07:38.930 --> 00:07:44.990
 comment clear is- and good see you 

00:07:42.510 --> 00:07:44.990
 in another video
