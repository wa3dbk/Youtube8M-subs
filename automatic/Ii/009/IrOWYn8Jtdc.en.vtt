00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:22.290 
charging it I take this plug out I just

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:24.680 
charging it I take this plug out I just
leave<00:02:22.500> that<00:02:22.530> open<00:02:22.710> so<00:02:23.160> the<00:02:23.280> inside<00:02:23.640> can<00:02:23.940> stay

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:24.690 
leave that open so the inside can stay

00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:28.130 
leave that open so the inside can stay
dry<00:02:24.960> but<00:02:25.230> every<00:02:25.410> so<00:02:25.590> often<00:02:25.770> I<00:02:26.040> just<00:02:26.930> just<00:02:27.930> give

dry but every so often I just just give

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:30.860 
dry but every so often I just just give
it<00:02:28.260> a<00:02:28.290> little<00:02:28.440> squirt<00:02:28.830> down<00:02:29.310> inside<00:02:29.730> there<00:02:29.970> so
