00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:13.100 
two we can see here that we start off
with<00:02:11.910> brainstorming

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:13.110 
with brainstorming

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:15.520 
with brainstorming
and<00:02:13.200> then<00:02:13.530> after<00:02:13.980> brainstorming<00:02:14.220> we<00:02:14.730> go<00:02:14.880> to

00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:15.530 
and then after brainstorming we go to

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:18.530 
and then after brainstorming we go to
organizing<00:02:16.530> information<00:02:16.910> when<00:02:17.910> we<00:02:18.030> organize

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:18.540 
organizing information when we organize

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:21.440 
organizing information when we organize
we<00:02:18.870> could<00:02:19.020> use<00:02:19.230> an<00:02:19.410> outline<00:02:20.100> or<00:02:20.340> a<00:02:21.000> graphic

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:21.450 
we could use an outline or a graphic

00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:24.710 
we could use an outline or a graphic
organizer<00:02:22.310> after<00:02:23.310> that<00:02:23.550> we<00:02:24.030> start<00:02:24.270> to<00:02:24.420> apply

00:02:24.710 --> 00:02:24.720 
organizer after that we start to apply

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:27.980 
organizer after that we start to apply
our<00:02:25.110> information<00:02:25.890> into<00:02:26.130> drafting<00:02:27.090> editing

00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:27.990 
our information into drafting editing

00:02:27.990 --> 00:02:30.550 
our information into drafting editing
and<00:02:28.140> revising<00:02:28.350> and<00:02:28.770> then<00:02:28.920> final<00:02:29.340> drafting

00:02:30.550 --> 00:02:30.560 
and revising and then final drafting

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:33.470 
and revising and then final drafting
graphic<00:02:31.560> organizers<00:02:32.130> help<00:02:32.430> us<00:02:32.610> to<00:02:32.790> take<00:02:33.030> the

00:02:33.470 --> 00:02:33.480 
graphic organizers help us to take the

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:35.030 
graphic organizers help us to take the
large<00:02:33.750> amount<00:02:34.050> of<00:02:34.140> information<00:02:34.710> that<00:02:34.830> has

00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:35.040 
large amount of information that has

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:37.160 
large amount of information that has
been<00:02:35.070> collected<00:02:35.760> and<00:02:35.880> organize<00:02:36.630> it<00:02:36.870> in<00:02:37.020> a
