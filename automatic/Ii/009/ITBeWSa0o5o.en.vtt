to<00:02:16.570> not<00:02:16.720> DJ<00:02:17.110> both<00:02:17.440> ears<00:02:17.710> and<00:02:18.190> I<00:02:18.310> also<00:02:18.460> tend<00:02:18.880> to

00:02:18.960 --> 00:02:18.970 
to not DJ both ears and I also tend to

00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:20.940 
to not DJ both ears and I also tend to
hold<00:02:19.270> that<00:02:19.420> headphone<00:02:19.810> on<00:02:19.990> the<00:02:20.080> one<00:02:20.230> ear<00:02:20.410> like

00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:21.460 
that

00:02:21.460 --> 00:02:25.290 
that
so<00:02:22.120> this<00:02:22.300> actually<00:02:22.900> it<00:02:23.680> is<00:02:24.280> the<00:02:24.460> way<00:02:24.550> I<00:02:24.580> DJ<00:02:25.120> I

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:25.300 
so this actually it is the way I DJ I

00:02:25.300 --> 00:02:27.420 
so this actually it is the way I DJ I
don't<00:02:25.510> think<00:02:26.170> I<00:02:26.380> would<00:02:26.590> like<00:02:26.830> to<00:02:27.070> use<00:02:27.280> it

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:27.430 
don't think I would like to use it

00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:30.320 
don't think I would like to use it
because<00:02:27.520> sometimes<00:02:28.270> if<00:02:28.570> I'm<00:02:28.720> getting<00:02:28.960> myself

00:02:30.320 --> 00:02:30.330 
because sometimes if I'm getting myself

00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:32.520 
because sometimes if I'm getting myself
you<00:02:31.330> know<00:02:31.450> it's<00:02:31.630> for<00:02:31.780> piccolo<00:02:32.230> or<00:02:32.350> what

00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:32.530 
you know it's for piccolo or what

00:02:32.530 --> 00:02:34.530 
you know it's for piccolo or what
children<00:02:32.920> would<00:02:33.040> have<00:02:33.070> play<00:02:33.280> next<00:02:33.550> the<00:02:34.270> way<00:02:34.510> I

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:34.540 
children would have play next the way I

00:02:34.540 --> 00:02:35.760 
children would have play next the way I
get<00:02:34.810> out<00:02:34.930> of<00:02:35.080> that<00:02:35.290> is<00:02:35.410> what<00:02:35.440> I<00:02:35.560> put<00:02:35.710> my

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:35.770 
get out of that is what I put my

00:02:35.770 --> 00:02:38.760 
get out of that is what I put my
headphones<00:02:36.070> on<00:02:36.600> turning<00:02:37.600> the<00:02:37.660> tune<00:02:37.900> up<00:02:38.080> taking

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:38.770 
headphones on turning the tune up taking

00:02:38.770 --> 00:02:39.240 
headphones on turning the tune up taking
a<00:02:38.830> deep<00:02:38.980> breath

00:02:39.240 --> 00:02:39.250 
a deep breath

00:02:39.250 --> 00:02:41.850 
a deep breath
closing<00:02:39.640> my<00:02:39.730> eyes<00:02:39.760> relaxing<00:02:40.660> and<00:02:40.780> saying<00:02:41.050> is

00:02:41.850 --> 00:02:41.860 
closing my eyes relaxing and saying is

00:02:41.860 --> 00:02:43.560 
closing my eyes relaxing and saying is
it<00:02:42.040> any<00:02:42.190> good<00:02:42.220> is<00:02:42.580> it<00:02:42.760> what<00:02:42.940> order<00:02:43.240> here<00:02:43.390> next

00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:43.570 
it any good is it what order here next

00:02:43.570 --> 00:02:44.790 
it any good is it what order here next
you<00:02:43.810> can't<00:02:44.080> do<00:02:44.200> that<00:02:44.350> with<00:02:44.500> one<00:02:44.590> of<00:02:44.680> these

00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:44.800 
you can't do that with one of these

00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:46.560 
you can't do that with one of these
because<00:02:45.010> you<00:02:45.160> can<00:02:45.310> never<00:02:45.520> get<00:02:45.850> rid<00:02:45.970> of<00:02:46.000> that<00:02:46.240> so

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:46.570 
because you can never get rid of that so

00:02:46.570 --> 00:02:47.460 
because you can never get rid of that so
much<00:02:46.720> you're<00:02:46.810> going<00:02:46.930> to<00:02:46.990> sit<00:02:47.170> there<00:02:47.200> like<00:02:47.410> that

00:02:47.460 --> 00:02:47.470 
much you're going to sit there like that

00:02:47.470 --> 00:02:49.560 
much you're going to sit there like that
and<00:02:47.890> even<00:02:48.580> then<00:02:48.670> it's<00:02:48.820> only<00:02:48.910> gonna<00:02:49.120> be<00:02:49.209> in<00:02:49.300> mono

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:49.570 
and even then it's only gonna be in mono

00:02:49.570 --> 00:02:51.960 
and even then it's only gonna be in mono
so<00:02:50.080> for<00:02:50.860> that<00:02:50.920> reason<00:02:50.980> I<00:02:51.430> don't<00:02:51.459> think<00:02:51.700> it's

00:02:51.960 --> 00:02:51.970 
so for that reason I don't think it's

00:02:51.970 --> 00:02:54.240 
so for that reason I don't think it's
for<00:02:52.120> me<00:02:52.270> but<00:02:52.570> these<00:02:53.470> guys<00:02:53.620> know<00:02:53.890> that<00:02:54.070> this

00:02:54.240 --> 00:02:54.250 
for me but these guys know that this

00:02:54.250 --> 00:02:56.250 
for me but these guys know that this
isn't<00:02:54.459> for<00:02:54.730> most<00:02:54.880> people<00:02:55.270> if<00:02:55.630> it<00:02:55.780> is<00:02:55.900> for<00:02:56.140> you

00:02:56.250 --> 00:02:56.260 
isn't for most people if it is for you
