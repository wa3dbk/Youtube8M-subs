one<00:01:27.440> of<00:01:27.470> the<00:01:27.620> core<00:01:27.950> reasons<00:01:27.980> why<00:01:28.430> I'm<00:01:28.550> degraded

00:01:28.900 --> 00:01:28.910 
one of the core reasons why I'm degraded

00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:31.870 
one of the core reasons why I'm degraded
throttle<00:01:29.360> so<00:01:30.260> the<00:01:31.070> first<00:01:31.340> thing<00:01:31.520> you<00:01:31.640> want<00:01:31.820> to

00:01:31.870 --> 00:01:31.880 
throttle so the first thing you want to

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:33.610 
throttle so the first thing you want to
do<00:01:32.000> is<00:01:32.210> have<00:01:32.390> the<00:01:32.540> loop<00:01:32.810> of<00:01:33.020> the<00:01:33.080> collar

00:01:33.610 --> 00:01:33.620 
do is have the loop of the collar

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:35.500 
do is have the loop of the collar
I<00:01:33.800> put<00:01:34.250> the<00:01:34.340> top<00:01:34.520> of<00:01:34.670> the<00:01:34.730> dog<00:01:34.940> that<00:01:35.360> just

00:01:35.500 --> 00:01:35.510 
I put the top of the dog that just

00:01:35.510 --> 00:01:37.900 
I put the top of the dog that just
allows<00:01:35.780> the<00:01:35.990> leash<00:01:36.170> to<00:01:36.410> run<00:01:36.560> the<00:01:36.770> back<00:01:37.670> of<00:01:37.820> the

00:01:37.900 --> 00:01:37.910 
allows the leash to run the back of the

00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:40.090 
allows the leash to run the back of the
dog's<00:01:38.120> back<00:01:38.440> and<00:01:39.440> then<00:01:39.590> you'll<00:01:39.740> turn<00:01:39.950> the

00:01:40.090 --> 00:01:40.100 
dog's back and then you'll turn the

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:43.060 
dog's back and then you'll turn the
leash<00:01:40.280> 90<00:01:40.700> degrees<00:01:41.260> running<00:01:42.260> underneath<00:01:42.620> your

00:01:43.060 --> 00:01:43.070 
leash 90 degrees running underneath your

00:01:43.070 --> 00:01:45.700 
leash 90 degrees running underneath your
dog's<00:01:43.250> stomach<00:01:43.750> and<00:01:44.750> then<00:01:45.200> bring<00:01:45.470> it<00:01:45.590> up

00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:45.710 
dog's stomach and then bring it up

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:47.749 
dog's stomach and then bring it up
through<00:01:46.100> the<00:01:46.130> top<00:01:46.490> through<00:01:47.150> the<00:01:47.180> loop

00:01:47.749 --> 00:01:47.759 
through the top through the loop

00:01:47.759 --> 00:01:50.959 
through the top through the loop
so<00:01:48.299> it<00:01:48.360> is<00:01:48.450> pollster<00:01:48.899> really<00:01:49.170> simply<00:01:49.590> I<00:01:49.969> use

00:01:50.959 --> 00:01:50.969 
so it is pollster really simply I use

00:01:50.969 --> 00:01:54.020 
so it is pollster really simply I use
the<00:01:51.119> metal<00:01:51.420> Oh<00:01:51.600> ring<00:01:51.869> just<00:01:52.079> to<00:01:52.229> allow<00:01:52.530> a<00:01:53.030> lot

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:54.030 
the metal Oh ring just to allow a lot

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:56.990 
the metal Oh ring just to allow a lot
more<00:01:54.060> loose<00:01:54.920> sliding<00:01:55.920> so<00:01:56.130> it<00:01:56.219> just<00:01:56.369> allows<00:01:56.490> for

00:01:56.990 --> 00:01:57.000 
more loose sliding so it just allows for

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:58.730 
more loose sliding so it just allows for
it<00:01:57.119> to<00:01:57.539> tight<00:01:57.750> when<00:01:58.049> it<00:01:58.140> needs<00:01:58.320> to

00:01:58.730 --> 00:01:58.740 
it to tight when it needs to

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:02.270 
it to tight when it needs to
so<00:01:59.280> the<00:01:59.520> as<00:01:59.880> you<00:02:00.149> pull<00:02:00.450> the<00:02:00.920> actual<00:02:01.920> leash<00:02:02.100> will

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:02.280 
so the as you pull the actual leash will

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:04.789 
so the as you pull the actual leash will
create<00:02:02.520> a<00:02:02.579> natural<00:02:03.000> consequence<00:02:03.570> so<00:02:04.470> the<00:02:04.619> dogs

00:02:04.789 --> 00:02:04.799 
create a natural consequence so the dogs

because<00:02:28.769> my<00:02:28.890> experience<00:02:29.310> of<00:02:29.400> dogs<00:02:29.610> is<00:02:29.790> they

00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:29.910 
because my experience of dogs is they

00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:32.270 
because my experience of dogs is they
don't<00:02:30.030> always<00:02:30.180> pull<00:02:30.650> so<00:02:31.650> you<00:02:31.709> only<00:02:31.980> have<00:02:32.160> to

00:02:32.270 --> 00:02:32.280 
don't always pull so you only have to

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:34.240 
don't always pull so you only have to
use<00:02:32.310> it<00:02:32.540> when<00:02:33.540> you<00:02:33.599> have<00:02:33.690> to<00:02:33.810> piss<00:02:33.959> upon

another thing I love about the pull more

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:39.199 
another thing I love about the pull more
is<00:02:36.599> the<00:02:36.810> safety<00:02:37.200> of<00:02:37.410> it<00:02:37.500> for<00:02:37.709> dogs<00:02:37.920> a<00:02:38.220> lot<00:02:39.120> of

00:02:39.199 --> 00:02:39.209 
is the safety of it for dogs a lot of

00:02:39.209 --> 00:02:40.550 
is the safety of it for dogs a lot of
choke<00:02:39.450> chains<00:02:39.690> out<00:02:39.870> there<00:02:40.079> like<00:02:40.230> I<00:02:40.260> said<00:02:40.349> they

00:02:40.550 --> 00:02:40.560 
choke chains out there like I said they

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:42.289 
choke chains out there like I said they

00:02:42.299 --> 00:02:44.509 
focus on the dog's neck that can
sometimes<00:02:42.599> cause<00:02:43.019> skin<00:02:43.349> irritation<00:02:43.980> it

00:02:44.509 --> 00:02:44.519
