show you is how you can simply use a

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:26.300 
show you is how you can simply use a
table<00:00:24.060> at<00:00:24.240> your<00:00:24.269> local<00:00:24.720> park<00:00:24.990> or<00:00:25.560> to<00:00:25.710> learn<00:00:25.859> how

table at your local park or to learn how
to<00:00:26.340> do<00:00:26.580> precision<00:00:26.939> jumps<00:00:27.390> and<00:00:27.750> parkour<00:00:28.170> roll

00:00:28.370 --> 00:00:28.380 
to do precision jumps and parkour roll

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:29.390 
to do precision jumps and parkour roll
so<00:00:28.590> the<00:00:28.680> first<00:00:28.859> thing<00:00:28.949> you<00:00:29.010> gonna<00:00:29.099> want<00:00:29.250> to<00:00:29.310> do

00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:29.400 
so the first thing you gonna want to do

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:31.130 
so the first thing you gonna want to do
is<00:00:29.490> stretch<00:00:29.699> out<00:00:29.910> because<00:00:30.510> when<00:00:30.990> the

00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:31.140 
is stretch out because when the

is stretch out because when the
apocalypse<00:00:31.619> is<00:00:31.769> happening<00:00:32.189> you<00:00:32.550> probably

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:32.880 
apocalypse is happening you probably

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:35.000 
apocalypse is happening you probably
won't<00:00:33.030> have<00:00:33.180> time<00:00:33.480> to<00:00:33.719> stretch<00:00:34.200> so<00:00:34.860> if<00:00:34.980> you

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:35.010 
won't have time to stretch so if you

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:36.799 
won't have time to stretch so if you
stretch<00:00:35.100> out<00:00:35.370> right<00:00:35.550> now<00:00:35.760> should<00:00:36.329> be<00:00:36.450> good<00:00:36.600> for

00:00:36.799 --> 00:00:36.809 
stretch out right now should be good for

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:38.389 
stretch out right now should be good for
a<00:00:36.870> while<00:00:37.079> and<00:00:37.530> on<00:00:37.649> top<00:00:37.829> of<00:00:37.860> that<00:00:37.980> it'll<00:00:38.309> help

luckily<00:01:01.710> with<00:01:02.039> my<00:01:02.190> shoes<00:01:02.430> you<00:01:02.670> kind<00:01:03.059> of<00:01:03.180> see

00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:03.390 
luckily with my shoes you kind of see

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:06.890 
luckily with my shoes you kind of see
just<00:01:04.080> where<00:01:04.409> my<00:01:04.769> toe<00:01:04.830> placement<00:01:05.519> is<00:01:05.640> so<00:01:06.360> the

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:06.900 
just where my toe placement is so the

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:08.390 
just where my toe placement is so the
reason<00:01:07.110> you<00:01:07.170> want<00:01:07.290> to<00:01:07.320> land<00:01:07.500> there<00:01:07.680> is<00:01:07.890> because

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:08.400 
reason you want to land there is because

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:09.740 
reason you want to land there is because
it<00:01:08.549> less<00:01:08.700> allows<00:01:09.090> you<00:01:09.270> to<00:01:09.360> have<00:01:09.479> a<00:01:09.510> lot<00:01:09.720> more

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:09.750 
it less allows you to have a lot more

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:12.440 
it less allows you to have a lot more
control<00:01:10.020> over<00:01:10.470> your<00:01:10.860> weight<00:01:11.159> so<00:01:12.150> if<00:01:12.270> you<00:01:12.360> have

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:12.450 
control over your weight so if you have

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:13.940 
control over your weight so if you have
a<00:01:12.510> lot<00:01:12.630> more<00:01:12.659> control<00:01:12.869> of<00:01:13.080> your<00:01:13.170> weight<00:01:13.380> then

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:13.950 
a lot more control of your weight then

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:15.230 
a lot more control of your weight then
you<00:01:13.979> can<00:01:14.310> stop<00:01:14.520> yourself<00:01:14.700> from<00:01:14.880> flying

00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:15.240 
you can stop yourself from flying

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:16.999 
you can stop yourself from flying
forward<00:01:15.570> and<00:01:15.840> flying<00:01:16.080> back<00:01:16.320> and<00:01:16.590> you<00:01:16.650> kind<00:01:16.920> of

forward and flying back and you kind of

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:18.410 
forward and flying back and you kind of
try<00:01:17.100> to<00:01:17.189> balance<00:01:17.400> out<00:01:17.759> now<00:01:18.030> the<00:01:18.090> key<00:01:18.390> to

00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:18.420 
try to balance out now the key to

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:21.230 
precision jumps and precision landings
you<00:01:20.520> want<00:01:20.700> to<00:01:20.759> make<00:01:20.850> sure<00:01:20.880> that<00:01:21.030> you're<00:01:21.150> able

00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:21.240 
you want to make sure that you're able

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:23.090 
you want to make sure that you're able
to<00:01:21.390> bend<00:01:21.570> your<00:01:21.750> knees<00:01:21.900> because<00:01:22.229> when<00:01:22.740> you<00:01:22.830> land

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:23.100 
to bend your knees because when you land

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:25.310 
to bend your knees because when you land
they<00:01:23.549> start<00:01:23.820> bending<00:01:23.939> your<00:01:24.150> legs<00:01:24.420> you<00:01:24.900> can<00:01:25.020> you

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:25.320 
they start bending your legs you can you

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:27.230 
they start bending your legs you can you
can<00:01:25.470> start<00:01:25.619> to<00:01:25.799> decelerate<00:01:26.100> you<00:01:26.790> can<00:01:26.939> slow

00:01:27.230 --> 00:01:27.240 
can start to decelerate you can slow

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:28.850 
can start to decelerate you can slow
down<00:01:27.270> so<00:01:27.720> you<00:01:27.780> don't<00:01:27.840> impact<00:01:28.409> the<00:01:28.560> ground

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:28.860 
down so you don't impact the ground

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:30.020 
down so you don't impact the ground
let's<00:01:29.220> say<00:01:29.280> you're<00:01:29.430> running<00:01:29.549> really<00:01:29.909> fast

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:30.030 
let's say you're running really fast

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:31.280 
let's say you're running really fast
then<00:01:30.479> you<00:01:30.509> have<00:01:30.630> to<00:01:30.720> jump<00:01:30.990> to<00:01:31.079> something

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:31.290 
then you have to jump to something

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:34.249 
then you have to jump to something
that's<00:01:31.560> a<00:01:31.770> bit<00:01:32.220> of<00:01:32.369> a<00:01:32.430> ways<00:01:32.610> away<00:01:32.759> and<00:01:33.570> it's<00:01:34.140> a

00:01:34.249 --> 00:01:34.259 
that's a bit of a ways away and it's a

00:01:34.259 --> 00:01:36.020 
that's a bit of a ways away and it's a
bit<00:01:34.439> higher<00:01:34.619> than<00:01:34.799> you<00:01:34.920> what<00:01:35.430> you<00:01:35.549> can<00:01:35.700> do<00:01:35.850> is

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:36.030 
bit higher than you what you can do is

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:38.030 
bit higher than you what you can do is
as<00:01:36.240> you<00:01:36.780> jump<00:01:36.990> you<00:01:37.259> place<00:01:37.560> your<00:01:37.740> feet<00:01:37.890> out<00:01:37.950> in

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:38.040 
as you jump you place your feet out in

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:39.350 
as you jump you place your feet out in
front<00:01:38.159> of<00:01:38.400> you<00:01:38.460> but<00:01:38.700> make<00:01:38.939> sure<00:01:38.970> you<00:01:39.150> don't

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:39.360 
front of you but make sure you don't

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:41.179 
front of you but make sure you don't
lock<00:01:39.540> your<00:01:39.750> knees<00:01:39.930> otherwise<00:01:40.200> you<00:01:40.680> will<00:01:40.890> hurt

00:01:41.179 --> 00:01:41.189 
lock your knees otherwise you will hurt

00:01:41.189 --> 00:01:43.370 
lock your knees otherwise you will hurt
yourself<00:01:41.759> and<00:01:41.880> I<00:01:42.060> do<00:01:42.119> not<00:01:42.420> appreciate<00:01:42.810> that

00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:43.380 
yourself and I do not appreciate that

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:46.310 
yourself and I do not appreciate that
you<00:01:43.920> can<00:01:44.070> jump<00:01:44.549> stick<00:01:45.180> out<00:01:45.270> your<00:01:45.450> legs<00:01:45.659> that

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:46.320 
you can jump stick out your legs that

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:48.620 
you can jump stick out your legs that
way<00:01:46.530> your<00:01:46.770> feet<00:01:46.979> make<00:01:47.280> first<00:01:47.520> contact<00:01:47.640> and<00:01:48.210> I

00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:48.630 
way your feet make first contact and I

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:50.929 
way your feet make first contact and I
personally<00:01:49.200> prefer<00:01:49.649> to<00:01:49.890> have<00:01:50.399> my<00:01:50.729> feet

00:01:50.929 --> 00:01:50.939 
personally prefer to have my feet

00:01:50.939 --> 00:01:52.670 
personally prefer to have my feet
actually<00:01:51.149> my<00:01:51.630> toes<00:01:51.869> be<00:01:51.990> pointed<00:01:52.290> up<00:01:52.380> towards

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:52.680 
actually my toes be pointed up towards

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:55.069 
actually my toes be pointed up towards
the<00:01:52.799> sky<00:01:52.950> a<00:01:53.100> bit<00:01:53.369> because<00:01:54.149> I<00:01:54.450> have<00:01:54.840> so<00:01:54.990> much

00:01:55.069 --> 00:01:55.079 
the sky a bit because I have so much

00:01:55.079 --> 00:01:57.649 
the sky a bit because I have so much
momentum<00:01:55.350> that<00:01:56.100> the<00:01:56.310> second<00:01:56.579> I<00:01:56.640> land<00:01:56.880> my<00:01:57.119> toes

00:01:57.649 --> 00:01:57.659 
momentum that the second I land my toes

00:01:57.659 --> 00:01:59.870 
momentum that the second I land my toes
will<00:01:57.899> actually<00:01:58.229> balance<00:01:58.439> out<00:01:58.799> forward<00:01:59.369> but

00:01:59.870 --> 00:01:59.880 
will actually balance out forward but

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:01.770 
will actually balance out forward but
again<00:02:00.119> this<00:02:00.659> all<00:02:00.869> comes<00:02:01.170> from<00:02:01.259> understand

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:01.780 
again this all comes from understand

00:02:01.780 --> 00:02:03.390 
again this all comes from understand
your<00:02:01.900> body<00:02:02.080> understanding<00:02:02.710> how<00:02:02.830> to<00:02:02.860> ship

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:03.400 
your body understanding how to ship

00:02:03.400 --> 00:02:05.070 
your body understanding how to ship
momentum<00:02:03.970> one<00:02:04.270> thing<00:02:04.420> not<00:02:04.510> to<00:02:04.630> forget<00:02:04.869> though

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:05.080 
momentum one thing not to forget though

00:02:05.080 --> 00:02:06.570 
momentum one thing not to forget though
is<00:02:05.320> that<00:02:05.380> you're<00:02:05.950> not<00:02:06.100> going<00:02:06.190> to<00:02:06.250> just<00:02:06.549> be

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:06.580 
is that you're not going to just be

00:02:06.580 --> 00:02:08.249 
is that you're not going to just be
jumping<00:02:07.030> pup<00:02:07.210> you're<00:02:07.690> also<00:02:07.810> gonna<00:02:07.990> have<00:02:08.050> to<00:02:08.170> be

00:02:08.249 --> 00:02:08.259 
jumping pup you're also gonna have to be

00:02:08.259 --> 00:02:10.080 
jumping pup you're also gonna have to be
jumping<00:02:08.590> down<00:02:08.890> to<00:02:09.100> things<00:02:09.340> so<00:02:09.670> let's<00:02:09.880> say

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:10.090 
jumping down to things so let's say

00:02:10.090 --> 00:02:11.250 
jumping down to things so let's say
you're<00:02:10.300> like<00:02:10.450> on<00:02:10.569> the<00:02:10.660> second<00:02:10.929> story<00:02:11.050> of<00:02:11.200> a

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:11.260 
you're like on the second story of a

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:13.080 
you're like on the second story of a
building<00:02:11.560> and<00:02:11.650> then<00:02:11.770> you<00:02:11.800> know<00:02:12.069> there<00:02:12.819> happens

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:13.090 
building and then you know there happens

00:02:13.090 --> 00:02:14.790 
building and then you know there happens
to<00:02:13.120> be<00:02:13.270> like<00:02:13.390> a<00:02:13.420> light<00:02:13.660> post<00:02:13.990> that's<00:02:14.470> breaking

00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:14.800 
to be like a light post that's breaking

00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:16.590 
to be like a light post that's breaking
and<00:02:15.190> falling<00:02:15.400> down<00:02:15.760> and<00:02:16.000> you<00:02:16.060> got<00:02:16.209> to<00:02:16.330> somehow

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:16.600 
and falling down and you got to somehow

00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:18.809 
and falling down and you got to somehow
jump<00:02:17.020> from<00:02:17.230> the<00:02:17.350> second<00:02:17.709> story<00:02:17.860> onto<00:02:18.280> the

light post
run<00:02:19.810> up<00:02:20.080> it<00:02:20.290> and<00:02:20.410> then<00:02:20.800> jump<00:02:21.100> off<00:02:21.250> of<00:02:21.310> the<00:02:21.550> edge

00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:21.700 
run up it and then jump off of the edge

00:02:21.700 --> 00:02:23.130 
run up it and then jump off of the edge
to<00:02:21.970> catch<00:02:22.180> a<00:02:22.270> roof<00:02:22.480> and<00:02:22.720> then<00:02:22.810> pull<00:02:23.020> yourself

00:02:23.130 --> 00:02:23.140 
to catch a roof and then pull yourself

00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:26.040 
to catch a roof and then pull yourself
up<00:02:23.680> with<00:02:24.100> the<00:02:24.190> cat<00:02:24.370> leap<00:02:24.690> yeah<00:02:25.690> you're<00:02:25.930> gonna

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:26.050

up with the cat leap yeah you're gonna
want<00:02:26.410> to<00:02:26.470> learn<00:02:26.680> how<00:02:26.860> to<00:02:26.890> precision<00:02:27.310> down<00:02:27.670> so

00:02:28.320 --> 00:02:28.330 
want to learn how to precision down so

00:02:28.330 --> 00:02:29.880 
want to learn how to precision down so
stand<00:02:28.569> on<00:02:28.660> top<00:02:28.810> of<00:02:28.989> the<00:02:29.050> table<00:02:29.319> as<00:02:29.410> well<00:02:29.590> and

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:36.370 
gonna want to jump down and practice

00:02:36.370 --> 00:02:39.360 
gonna want to jump down and practice
landing<00:02:36.850> and<00:02:37.030> just<00:02:37.330> sticky<00:02:37.690> and<00:02:38.100> you<00:02:39.100> don't

00:02:40.949 --> 00:02:40.959 
want to try to rely on your hands too

00:02:40.959 --> 00:02:44.550 
want to try to rely on your hands too
much<00:02:40.989> on<00:02:41.350> it<00:02:41.500> because<00:02:42.220> the<00:02:43.090> thing<00:02:43.269> is<00:02:43.350> this<00:02:44.350> is

much on it because the thing is this is
all<00:02:44.739> in<00:02:44.860> practice<00:02:45.280> and<00:02:45.459> practical<00:02:46.209> use<00:02:46.390> when

00:02:46.559 --> 00:02:46.569 
all in practice and practical use when

00:02:46.569 --> 00:02:47.790 
all in practice and practical use when

00:04:20.310 --> 00:04:20.320 
because you never know exactly where

00:04:20.320 --> 00:04:22.439 
because you never know exactly where
your<00:04:20.440> momentum<00:04:20.650> might<00:04:21.220> primarily<00:04:21.729> be<00:04:22.030> so<00:04:22.270> if

00:04:22.439 --> 00:04:22.449 
your momentum might primarily be so if

00:04:22.449 --> 00:04:23.670 
your momentum might primarily be so if
you're<00:04:22.539> gonna<00:04:22.630> do<00:04:22.840> it<00:04:22.870> both<00:04:23.139> ways<00:04:23.350> it's

00:04:23.670 --> 00:04:23.680 
you're gonna do it both ways it's

00:04:23.680 --> 00:04:24.420 
you're gonna do it both ways it's
instinctually

00:04:24.420 --> 00:04:24.430 
instinctually

00:04:24.430 --> 00:04:26.249 
instinctually
that's<00:04:24.940> the<00:04:25.150> best<00:04:25.330> deal<00:04:25.539> start<00:04:25.960> on<00:04:26.050> the<00:04:26.139> ground

00:04:26.249 --> 00:04:26.259 
that's the best deal start on the ground

00:04:26.259 --> 00:04:28.710 
that's the best deal start on the ground
and<00:04:26.620> just<00:04:27.009> roll<00:04:27.340> forward<00:04:27.370> and<00:04:28.060> just<00:04:28.300> practice

00:04:28.710 --> 00:04:28.720 
and just roll forward and just practice

00:04:28.720 --> 00:04:30.150 
and just roll forward and just practice
your<00:04:28.750> rolls<00:04:29.050> over<00:04:29.259> each<00:04:29.500> shoulder<00:04:29.530> and<00:04:30.070> then

00:04:30.150 --> 00:04:30.160 
your rolls over each shoulder and then
