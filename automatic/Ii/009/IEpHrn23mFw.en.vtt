00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:44.830 
basically working out many many

00:01:44.830 --> 00:01:46.320 
basically working out many many
different<00:01:45.130> kinds<00:01:45.460> of<00:01:45.610> colors<00:01:45.790> and<00:01:45.909> designs

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:46.330 
different kinds of colors and designs

00:01:46.330 --> 00:01:47.640 
different kinds of colors and designs
for<00:01:46.630> the<00:01:46.659> backboards<00:01:47.110> of<00:01:47.200> our<00:01:47.290> notebooks

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:47.650 
for the backboards of our notebooks

00:01:47.650 --> 00:01:49.500 
for the backboards of our notebooks
ranging<00:01:48.369> from<00:01:48.490> automobile<00:01:49.030> paint<00:01:49.150> finishes

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:49.510 
ranging from automobile paint finishes

00:01:49.510 --> 00:01:52.500 
ranging from automobile paint finishes
to<00:01:50.229> airbrushing<00:01:50.830> to<00:01:51.610> even<00:01:51.970> carbon<00:01:52.270> fiber

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:52.510 
to airbrushing to even carbon fiber

00:01:52.510 --> 00:01:53.910 
to airbrushing to even carbon fiber
which<00:01:52.840> will<00:01:52.990> be<00:01:53.080> one<00:01:53.200> of<00:01:53.320> our<00:01:53.500> more<00:01:53.650> premium

00:01:53.910 --> 00:01:53.920 
which will be one of our more premium

00:01:53.920 --> 00:01:55.740 
which will be one of our more premium
finishes<00:01:54.369> and<00:01:54.580> as<00:01:55.119> you<00:01:55.180> can<00:01:55.299> see<00:01:55.330> users<00:01:55.600> can

00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:55.750 
finishes and as you can see users can

00:01:55.750 --> 00:01:57.420

also choose the metallic logos on their

00:01:57.430 --> 00:01:59.190 
also choose the metallic logos on their
notebooks<00:01:57.760> when<00:01:58.450> we<00:01:58.600> have<00:01:58.750> a<00:01:58.810> wide<00:01:59.049> variety

00:01:59.190 --> 00:01:59.200 
notebooks when we have a wide variety

00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:02.030 
notebooks when we have a wide variety
for<00:01:59.560> you<00:01:59.619> to<00:01:59.710> choose<00:01:59.799> from

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:04.030 
we're going to be doing a whole series

00:02:04.030 --> 00:02:05.580 
we're going to be doing a whole series
of<00:02:04.180> benchmarks<00:02:04.750> on<00:02:04.840> the<00:02:04.930> aftershock<00:02:05.260> actually

00:02:05.580 --> 00:02:05.590 
of benchmarks on the aftershock actually

00:02:05.590 --> 00:02:07.950 
of benchmarks on the aftershock actually
13<00:02:05.920> and<00:02:06.280> this<00:02:06.940> is<00:02:07.000> just<00:02:07.060> a<00:02:07.240> showcase<00:02:07.570> the<00:02:07.750> power

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:07.960 
13 and this is just a showcase the power

00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:09.570 
13 and this is just a showcase the power
of<00:02:08.080> this<00:02:08.170> machine<00:02:08.530> just<00:02:09.009> how<00:02:09.130> much<00:02:09.250> power<00:02:09.460> you

00:02:09.570 --> 00:02:09.580 
of this machine just how much power you

00:02:09.580 --> 00:02:11.400 
of this machine just how much power you
can<00:02:09.729> get<00:02:09.820> in<00:02:09.940> such<00:02:10.060> a<00:02:10.090> small<00:02:10.300> notebook<00:02:10.690> and

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:11.410 
can get in such a small notebook and

00:02:11.410 --> 00:02:12.450 
can get in such a small notebook and
we're<00:02:11.560> gonna<00:02:11.650> be<00:02:11.740> benchmarking<00:02:12.130> various

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:12.460 
we're gonna be benchmarking various

00:02:12.460 --> 00:02:13.800 
we're gonna be benchmarking various
games<00:02:12.700> as<00:02:12.910> well<00:02:13.030> as<00:02:13.120> taking<00:02:13.270> a<00:02:13.420> look<00:02:13.540> at<00:02:13.630> things

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:13.810 
games as well as taking a look at things

00:02:13.810 --> 00:02:15.180 
games as well as taking a look at things
like<00:02:13.900> battery<00:02:14.260> life<00:02:14.500> and<00:02:14.650> performance<00:02:14.860> in

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:15.190 
like battery life and performance in

00:02:15.190 --> 00:02:17.190 
like battery life and performance in
professional<00:02:15.640> applications<00:02:16.180> so<00:02:16.750> yeah<00:02:16.870> stay

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:17.200 
professional applications so yeah stay

00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:18.570 
professional applications so yeah stay
tuned<00:02:17.410> for<00:02:17.620> more<00:02:17.740> videos<00:02:17.800> of<00:02:18.130> the<00:02:18.250> aftershock

00:02:18.570 --> 00:02:18.580 
tuned for more videos of the aftershock

00:02:18.580 --> 00:02:21.180 
tuned for more videos of the aftershock
