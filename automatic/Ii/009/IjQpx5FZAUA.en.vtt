in the five minutes because Swansea

00:00:26.930 --> 00:00:29.880 
in the five minutes because Swansea
changed<00:00:27.440> the<00:00:27.530> shape<00:00:27.770> that<00:00:27.830> is<00:00:28.250> the<00:00:29.030> benefit<00:00:29.480> of

place be because they have tried
everything<00:00:38.199> to<00:00:39.199> make<00:00:39.230> a<00:00:39.679> good<00:00:39.949> result<00:00:40.929> like<00:00:41.929> we

00:00:42.189 --> 00:00:42.199 
everything to make a good result like we

00:00:42.199 --> 00:00:46.329 
everything to make a good result like we
have<00:00:42.829> done<00:00:43.100> but<00:00:43.820> but<00:00:44.559> in<00:00:45.559> the<00:00:45.829> five<00:00:46.039> minutes

00:00:46.329 --> 00:00:46.339 
have done but but in the five minutes

00:00:46.339 --> 00:00:48.819 
have done but but in the five minutes
that<00:00:46.579> they<00:00:47.089> change<00:00:47.390> the<00:00:47.570> shape<00:00:47.809> the<00:00:48.559> first

00:00:48.819 --> 00:00:48.829 
that they change the shape the first

00:00:48.829 --> 00:00:51.959 
that they change the shape the first
five<00:00:49.100> minutes<00:00:49.370> they<00:00:49.850> scored<00:00:50.210> two<00:00:50.449> goals<00:00:50.480> and

00:00:51.959 --> 00:00:51.969 
five minutes they scored two goals and

00:00:51.969 --> 00:00:54.910 
five minutes they scored two goals and
it's<00:00:52.969> a<00:00:53.089> big<00:00:53.269> lesson<00:00:53.480> for<00:00:53.870> us<00:00:53.899> because<00:00:54.289> we<00:00:54.769> have

00:00:54.910 --> 00:00:54.920 
it's a big lesson for us because we have

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:56.979 
it's a big lesson for us because we have
to<00:00:55.069> add<00:00:55.219> that<00:00:55.249> much<00:00:55.969> more<00:00:55.999> quickly<00:00:56.539> than<00:00:56.929> we

00:00:56.979 --> 00:00:56.989 
to add that much more quickly than we

00:00:56.989 --> 00:01:00.459 
to add that much more quickly than we
have<00:00:57.289> done<00:00:57.399> and<00:00:58.399> you<00:00:58.550> have<00:00:58.729> seen<00:00:58.999> what<00:00:59.899> Swansea

00:01:00.459 --> 00:01:00.469 
have done and you have seen what Swansea

00:01:00.469 --> 00:01:07.600 
have done and you have seen what Swansea
has<00:01:00.649> have<00:01:01.190> done<00:01:01.600> after<00:01:02.600> the<00:01:03.109> 21<00:01:03.879> they<00:01:06.610> changed

00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:07.610 
has have done after the 21 they changed

00:01:07.610 --> 00:01:10.719 
has have done after the 21 they changed
in<00:01:07.760> a<00:01:07.820> compactness<00:01:08.540> and<00:01:09.009> we<00:01:10.009> didn't<00:01:10.520> see<00:01:10.579> that

00:01:10.719 --> 00:01:10.729 
in a compactness and we didn't see that

00:01:10.729 --> 00:01:15.429 
in a compactness and we didn't see that
before<00:01:11.890> because<00:01:12.890> they<00:01:13.189> want<00:01:13.549> to<00:01:14.329> have<00:01:15.170> that

00:01:15.429 --> 00:01:15.439 
before because they want to have that

00:01:15.439 --> 00:01:18.310 
before because they want to have that
result<00:01:15.950> of<00:01:16.820> course<00:01:17.240> it's<00:01:17.570> different<00:01:17.810> because

00:01:18.310 --> 00:01:18.320 
result of course it's different because

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:20.980 
result of course it's different because
we<00:01:18.950> were<00:01:19.130> 85<00:01:19.640> minutes<00:01:19.969> the<00:01:20.240> better<00:01:20.479> team<00:01:20.810> and

00:01:20.980 --> 00:01:20.990 
we were 85 minutes the better team and

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:24.399 
we were 85 minutes the better team and
when<00:01:21.979> you<00:01:22.130> score<00:01:22.430> a<00:01:22.460> five<00:01:22.820> minutes<00:01:23.240> then<00:01:24.170> you

00:01:24.399 --> 00:01:24.409 
when you score a five minutes then you

00:01:24.409 --> 00:01:26.499 
when you score a five minutes then you
know<00:01:24.619> that<00:01:24.860> you<00:01:25.009> have<00:01:25.189> to<00:01:25.310> fight<00:01:25.549> for<00:01:25.579> it<00:01:26.180> and

00:01:26.499 --> 00:01:26.509 
know that you have to fight for it and

00:01:26.509 --> 00:01:30.940 
know that you have to fight for it and
then<00:01:27.380> you<00:01:28.159> do<00:01:28.399> that<00:01:28.719> more<00:01:29.719> easier<00:01:30.469> and<00:01:30.740> more

00:01:30.940 --> 00:01:30.950 
then you do that more easier and more

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:34.330 
then you do that more easier and more
quicker<00:01:31.280> than<00:01:32.240> a<00:01:32.299> team<00:01:32.899> that<00:01:33.229> is<00:01:33.590> dominating

00:01:34.330 --> 00:01:34.340 
quicker than a team that is dominating

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:40.650 
quicker than a team that is dominating
the<00:01:34.520> game<00:01:34.549> we

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:40.660 

00:01:40.660 --> 00:01:43.570 

you<00:01:41.660> you<00:01:42.200> can<00:01:42.440> write<00:01:42.680> everything<00:01:43.070> what<00:01:43.460> you

00:01:43.570 --> 00:01:43.580 
you you can write everything what you

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:49.320 
you you can write everything what you
want<00:01:43.850> sir<00:01:44.570> because<00:01:46.990> you<00:01:47.990> want<00:01:48.230> to<00:01:48.350> write<00:01:48.560> it

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:49.330 
want sir because you want to write it

00:01:49.330 --> 00:01:54.190 
want sir because you want to write it
and<00:01:50.330> and<00:01:51.010> now<00:01:52.010> what<00:01:52.460> I<00:01:52.490> always<00:01:52.910> say<00:01:53.330> is<00:01:53.840> that

00:01:54.190 --> 00:01:54.200 
and and now what I always say is that

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:58.030 
and and now what I always say is that
defending<00:01:55.160> starts<00:01:55.880> in<00:01:56.120> front<00:01:56.510> and<00:01:56.770> not<00:01:57.770> only

00:01:58.030 --> 00:01:58.040 
defending starts in front and not only

00:01:58.040 --> 00:02:00.490 
defending starts in front and not only
in<00:01:58.460> the<00:01:58.610> last<00:01:58.790> line<00:01:59.150> and<00:01:59.420> you<00:01:59.780> can<00:01:59.990> always

00:02:00.490 --> 00:02:00.500 
in the last line and you can always

00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:04.240 
in the last line and you can always
analyze<00:02:01.100> errors<00:02:01.720> but<00:02:02.720> I<00:02:03.110> don't<00:02:03.680> think<00:02:03.950> that's

00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:04.250 
analyze errors but I don't think that's

00:02:04.250 --> 00:02:07.510 
analyze errors but I don't think that's
the<00:02:04.370> good<00:02:04.970> way<00:02:05.210> you<00:02:05.570> have<00:02:05.780> to<00:02:06.020> see<00:02:06.650> how<00:02:07.460> the

00:02:07.510 --> 00:02:07.520 
the good way you have to see how the

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:13.800 
the good way you have to see how the
team<00:02:07.970> is<00:02:09.100> defending<00:02:10.100> a<00:02:10.310> CT<00:02:10.700> and<00:02:11.590> then<00:02:12.590> I<00:02:12.860> know

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:13.810 
team is defending a CT and then I know

00:02:13.810 --> 00:02:17.410 
team is defending a CT and then I know
what<00:02:14.810> else<00:02:15.080> has<00:02:15.470> has<00:02:15.740> been<00:02:16.040> made<00:02:16.220> and<00:02:16.490> at<00:02:17.209> the

00:02:17.410 --> 00:02:17.420 
what else has has been made and at the

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:20.380 
what else has has been made and at the
end<00:02:17.450> of<00:02:17.900> course<00:02:18.410> the<00:02:18.740> pressure<00:02:19.040> for<00:02:19.430> the<00:02:19.580> the

00:02:20.380 --> 00:02:20.390 
end of course the pressure for the the

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:22.510 
end of course the pressure for the the
goalkeeper<00:02:21.050> or<00:02:21.230> the<00:02:21.560> last<00:02:21.800> defender<00:02:22.340> is

00:02:22.510 --> 00:02:22.520 
goalkeeper or the last defender is

00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:28.900 
goalkeeper or the last defender is
always<00:02:23.000> higher<00:02:23.410> so<00:02:24.410> I<00:02:25.209> are<00:02:26.209> not<00:02:26.510> agree<00:02:27.910> when

00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:28.910 
always higher so I are not agree when

00:02:28.910 --> 00:02:34.210 
always higher so I are not agree when
you<00:02:29.090> only<00:02:30.400> say<00:02:31.400> or<00:02:31.730> wants<00:02:32.450> to<00:02:32.600> write<00:02:33.170> that<00:02:33.620> okay

00:02:34.210 --> 00:02:34.220

same so you can write it down that you
are<00:03:17.780> thinking<00:03:18.260> it's<00:03:18.830> a<00:03:19.210> minor<00:03:20.210> point<00:03:20.600> but<00:03:20.810> I'm

00:03:21.580 --> 00:03:21.590

not<00:03:21.890> like<00:03:22.460> that<00:03:22.490> I'm<00:03:22.880> not<00:03:23.120> thinking<00:03:23.750> like<00:03:23.900> that

00:03:24.130 --> 00:03:24.140

you are satisfied because that is

00:03:50.090 --> 00:03:53.500

00:04:04.530 --> 00:04:04.540 
than we then we have scattered before so

00:04:04.540 --> 00:04:07.510 
than we then we have scattered before so
we<00:04:05.540> know<00:04:05.750> already<00:04:05.990> in<00:04:06.500> advance<00:04:06.920> what<00:04:07.160> what

what is happening or what is not

00:04:09.770 --> 00:04:14.110 
what is happening or what is not
happening<00:04:10.450> so<00:04:11.920> it's<00:04:12.920> not<00:04:13.070> an<00:04:13.250> issue<00:04:13.400> and<00:04:13.760> when

00:04:14.110 --> 00:04:14.120 
happening so it's not an issue and when

00:04:14.120 --> 00:04:17.979 
happening so it's not an issue and when
it<00:04:14.240> is<00:04:14.360> like<00:04:14.600> that<00:04:15.070> we<00:04:16.070> have<00:04:16.280> to<00:04:16.570> keep<00:04:17.570> on<00:04:17.780> and

00:04:17.979 --> 00:04:17.989 
it is like that we have to keep on and

00:04:17.989 --> 00:04:20.680 
it is like that we have to keep on and
in<00:04:18.620> January<00:04:19.250> the<00:04:19.580> windows<00:04:19.940> are<00:04:20.120> open<00:04:20.570> again

00:04:20.680 --> 00:04:20.690 
in January the windows are open again

00:04:20.690 --> 00:04:24.850 
in January the windows are open again
and<00:04:21.380> it<00:04:21.920> is<00:04:22.070> like<00:04:22.280> that<00:04:22.460> it's<00:04:22.760> a<00:04:22.970> process<00:04:23.300> and<00:04:23.860> I

00:04:24.850 --> 00:04:24.860 
and it is like that it's a process and I

00:04:24.860 --> 00:04:28.630 
and it is like that it's a process and I
cannot<00:04:25.430> change<00:04:25.490> that<00:04:26.000> process<00:04:26.630> because<00:04:27.640> you

00:04:28.630 --> 00:04:28.640 
cannot change that process because you

00:04:28.640 --> 00:04:32.320 
cannot change that process because you
are<00:04:28.790> dependable<00:04:29.800> not<00:04:30.800> only<00:04:31.250> from<00:04:31.610> the<00:04:31.880> player
