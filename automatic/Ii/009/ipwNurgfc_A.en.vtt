happy with this puzzle out of the boxes
turn<00:00:19.769> wonderfully<00:00:20.429> and<00:00:20.489> actually<00:00:21.089> came<00:00:21.329> pre

00:00:21.620 --> 00:00:21.630 
turn wonderfully and actually came pre

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:24.470 
turn wonderfully and actually came pre
loop<00:00:21.869> so<00:00:22.320> that's<00:00:22.560> plus<00:00:22.769> the<00:00:23.669> overall<00:00:24.089> turning

00:00:24.470 --> 00:00:24.480 
loop so that's plus the overall turning

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:26.300 
loop so that's plus the overall turning
up<00:00:24.569> this<00:00:24.749> puzzle<00:00:25.169> is<00:00:25.319> great<00:00:25.739> it<00:00:25.919> is<00:00:25.949> smooth

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:26.310 
up this puzzle is great it is smooth

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:28.759 
up this puzzle is great it is smooth
fast<00:00:26.609> and<00:00:26.849> very<00:00:26.999> controllable<00:00:27.659> but<00:00:28.319> it<00:00:28.439> does

00:00:28.759 --> 00:00:28.769 
fast and very controllable but it does

00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:30.979 
fast and very controllable but it does
not<00:00:29.009> corner<00:00:29.489> cut<00:00:29.669> and<00:00:29.819> will<00:00:29.970> pop<00:00:30.210> when<00:00:30.479> it<00:00:30.749> you

00:00:30.979 --> 00:00:30.989 
not corner cut and will pop when it you

00:00:30.989 --> 00:00:34.099 
not corner cut and will pop when it you
attempt<00:00:31.319> to<00:00:31.409> do<00:00:31.589> it<00:00:31.739> and<00:00:31.970> you<00:00:32.970> absolutely<00:00:33.750> do

00:00:34.099 --> 00:00:34.109 
attempt to do it and you absolutely do

00:00:34.109 --> 00:00:35.840 
attempt to do it and you absolutely do
not<00:00:34.289> want<00:00:34.350> to<00:00:34.920> pop<00:00:35.100> it<00:00:35.280> because<00:00:35.550> it<00:00:35.670> is<00:00:35.760> very

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:35.850 
not want to pop it because it is very

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:38.420 
not want to pop it because it is very
difficult<00:00:36.210> to<00:00:36.570> reassemble<00:00:37.170> another<00:00:38.070> thing

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:38.430 
difficult to reassemble another thing

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:40.189 
difficult to reassemble another thing
too<00:00:38.609> is<00:00:38.730> that<00:00:38.879> the<00:00:39.000> horizontal<00:00:39.629> layers<00:00:39.840> don't

00:00:40.189 --> 00:00:40.199 
too is that the horizontal layers don't

00:00:40.199 --> 00:00:42.470 
too is that the horizontal layers don't
turn<00:00:40.440> very<00:00:40.649> fast<00:00:41.039> but<00:00:41.640> that's<00:00:41.850> just<00:00:41.969> a<00:00:42.210> minor

00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:42.480 
turn very fast but that's just a minor

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:45.349 
turn very fast but that's just a minor
thing<00:00:43.010> stickers<00:00:44.010> on<00:00:44.190> this<00:00:44.399> cube<00:00:44.699> are<00:00:44.879> very

00:00:45.349 --> 00:00:45.359 
thing stickers on this cube are very

00:00:45.359 --> 00:00:48.169 
thing stickers on this cube are very
very<00:00:45.750> good<00:00:45.989> quality<00:00:46.320> and<00:00:46.829> the<00:00:47.219> colors<00:00:47.550> are<00:00:47.789> the

00:00:48.169 --> 00:00:48.179 
very good quality and the colors are the

00:00:48.179 --> 00:00:50.900 
very good quality and the colors are the
same<00:00:48.210> shade<00:00:48.719> as<00:00:48.750> the<00:00:49.019> Diane<00:00:49.500> stickers<00:00:50.010> these

00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:50.910 
same shade as the Diane stickers these

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:53.119 
same shade as the Diane stickers these
puzzles<00:00:51.390> do<00:00:51.719> have<00:00:52.019> a<00:00:52.050> different<00:00:52.649> color<00:00:52.829> scheme

00:00:53.119 --> 00:00:53.129 
puzzles do have a different color scheme

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:55.700 
puzzles do have a different color scheme
than<00:00:53.309> the<00:00:53.399> mf8<00:00:53.910> version<00:00:54.390> because<00:00:55.109> this<00:00:55.350> is<00:00:55.530> the

00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:55.710 
than the mf8 version because this is the

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:57.529 
than the mf8 version because this is the
normal<00:00:55.949> rubik's<00:00:56.489> color<00:00:56.760> scheme<00:00:57.149> as<00:00:57.300> you<00:00:57.420> can

00:00:57.529 --> 00:00:57.539 
normal rubik's color scheme as you can

00:00:57.539 --> 00:01:00.529 
normal rubik's color scheme as you can

00:01:00.529 --> 00:01:00.539 
see flew opposite green red opposite

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:03.619 
see flew opposite green red opposite

00:01:05.150 --> 00:01:05.160 
normally at this part of the video I

00:01:05.160 --> 00:01:06.800 
normally at this part of the video I
would<00:01:05.460> show<00:01:05.730> you<00:01:05.760> the<00:01:05.970> mechanism<00:01:06.540> of<00:01:06.630> this

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:06.810 
would show you the mechanism of this

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:08.840 
would show you the mechanism of this
puzzle<00:01:07.050> but<00:01:07.800> because<00:01:08.100> it's<00:01:08.280> so<00:01:08.430> hard<00:01:08.760> to

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:08.850 
puzzle but because it's so hard to

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:10.670 
puzzle but because it's so hard to
assemble<00:01:09.480> and<00:01:09.630> reassemble<00:01:10.140> I'm<00:01:10.260> just<00:01:10.500> going

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:10.680 
assemble and reassemble I'm just going

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:12.770 
assemble and reassemble I'm just going

to give you a link to the disassembly

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:14.540 
to give you a link to the disassembly
and<00:01:12.810> reassembly<00:01:13.050> tutorial<00:01:14.040> that<00:01:14.220> i<00:01:14.250> posted

and reassembly tutorial that i posted

00:01:14.550 --> 00:01:17.210 
and reassembly tutorial that i posted
some<00:01:15.240> time<00:01:15.450> ago<00:01:15.570> the<00:01:16.320> puzzle<00:01:16.650> itself<00:01:17.040> is

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:17.220 
some time ago the puzzle itself is

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:19.670 
some time ago the puzzle itself is
actually<00:01:17.370> smaller<00:01:18.090> than<00:01:18.390> a<00:01:18.600> regular<00:01:19.020> 3<00:01:19.500> by<00:01:19.650> 3

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:19.680 
actually smaller than a regular 3 by 3

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:28.520 
actually smaller than a regular 3 by 3
if<00:01:20.520> you<00:01:20.760> see<00:01:21.630> if<00:01:22.230> you<00:01:22.380> want<00:01:22.530> to<00:01:22.620> look<00:01:22.800> I'm<00:01:25.700> Shane

if you see if you want to look I'm Shane
it<00:01:29.040> is<00:01:29.159> a<00:01:29.190> little<00:01:29.490> bit<00:01:29.640> smaller<00:01:30.290> but<00:01:31.290> the

00:01:31.399 --> 00:01:31.409 
it is a little bit smaller but the

00:01:31.409 --> 00:01:33.050 
it is a little bit smaller but the
surprising<00:01:32.010> thing<00:01:32.040> is<00:01:32.220> that's<00:01:32.549> actually<00:01:33.030> a

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:33.060 
surprising thing is that's actually a

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:35.090 
surprising thing is that's actually a
little<00:01:33.270> bit<00:01:33.510> heavier<00:01:33.900> anyways<00:01:34.890> the

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:35.100 
little bit heavier anyways the

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:37.160 
little bit heavier anyways the
difficulty<00:01:35.700> of<00:01:35.729> this<00:01:35.940> puzzle<00:01:36.210> is<00:01:36.540> a<00:01:36.900> little

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:37.170 
difficulty of this puzzle is a little

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:39.499 
difficulty of this puzzle is a little
hard<00:01:37.470> another<00:01:38.369> thing<00:01:38.700> too<00:01:38.880> is<00:01:39.000> that<00:01:39.180> it's<00:01:39.330> also

00:01:39.499 --> 00:01:39.509 
hard another thing too is that it's also

00:01:39.509 --> 00:01:41.149 
hard another thing too is that it's also
a<00:01:39.690> little<00:01:39.840> hard<00:01:40.140> because<00:01:40.259> it<00:01:40.560> uses<00:01:40.740> different

00:01:41.149 --> 00:01:41.159 
a little hard because it uses different

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:44.480 
a little hard because it uses different
notation<00:01:41.909> than<00:01:42.360> a<00:01:42.390> regular<00:01:42.630> kind<00:01:43.049> of<00:01:43.200> Q<00:01:43.490> which

00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:44.490 
notation than a regular kind of Q which

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:46.460 
notation than a regular kind of Q which
takes<00:01:44.820> some<00:01:45.030> time<00:01:45.240> getting<00:01:45.509> used<00:01:45.630> to<00:01:45.990> so

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:46.470 
takes some time getting used to so

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:47.990 
takes some time getting used to so
overall<00:01:46.890> what<00:01:47.100> would<00:01:47.250> I<00:01:47.280> rate<00:01:47.520> this<00:01:47.640> puzzle

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:48.000 
overall what would I rate this puzzle

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:49.700 
overall what would I rate this puzzle
about<00:01:48.509> four<00:01:48.720> and<00:01:48.750> a<00:01:48.869> half<00:01:48.899> out<00:01:49.200> of<00:01:49.229> five<00:01:49.350> it

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:49.710 
about four and a half out of five it

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:52.580 
about four and a half out of five it
does<00:01:50.399> have<00:01:50.610> some<00:01:50.880> minor<00:01:51.350> disadvantages<00:01:52.350> but

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:52.590 
does have some minor disadvantages but

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:55.219 
does have some minor disadvantages but
overall<00:01:52.950> it's<00:01:53.280> a<00:01:53.399> pretty<00:01:53.430> good<00:01:53.909> puzzle<00:01:54.210> and<00:01:54.570> I

00:01:55.219 --> 00:01:55.229 
overall it's a pretty good puzzle and I

00:01:55.229 --> 00:01:56.480 
overall it's a pretty good puzzle and I
would<00:01:55.380> recommend<00:01:55.680> it<00:01:55.920> to<00:01:55.950> a<00:01:56.070> lot<00:01:56.250> of<00:01:56.340> people

00:01:56.480 --> 00:01:56.490 
would recommend it to a lot of people

00:01:56.490 --> 00:01:58.670 
would recommend it to a lot of people
okay<00:01:57.270> so<00:01:57.330> I<00:01:57.479> got<00:01:57.690> this<00:01:57.869> from<00:01:58.049> my<00:01:58.229> cube<00:01:58.500> Mar

00:01:58.670 --> 00:01:58.680 
okay so I got this from my cube Mar
