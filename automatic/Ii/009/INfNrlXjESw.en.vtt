the<00:00:08.890> natural<00:00:09.280> processes<00:00:09.730> that<00:00:09.910> create<00:00:10.420> a

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:10.450 
the natural processes that create a

00:00:10.450 --> 00:00:12.960 
the natural processes that create a
storm<00:00:10.900> is<00:00:11.110> the<00:00:11.139> air<00:00:11.349> lifts<00:00:11.950> and<00:00:12.100> heats<00:00:12.310> it's

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:12.970 
storm is the air lifts and heats it's

00:00:12.970 --> 00:00:14.460 
storm is the air lifts and heats it's
that<00:00:13.180> same<00:00:13.390> process<00:00:13.600> that<00:00:14.020> we're<00:00:14.140> trying<00:00:14.350> to

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:14.470 
that same process that we're trying to

00:00:14.470 --> 00:00:16.800 
that same process that we're trying to
find<00:00:14.770> in<00:00:15.280> the<00:00:15.730> form<00:00:15.940> of<00:00:16.029> thermals<00:00:16.480> so<00:00:16.570> that<00:00:16.689> we

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:16.810 
find in the form of thermals so that we

00:00:16.810 --> 00:00:26.430 
find in the form of thermals so that we
can<00:00:16.990> lift<00:00:17.230> up<00:00:17.439> off<00:00:17.680> the<00:00:17.710> ground

what<00:00:27.440> does<00:00:27.530> paragliding<00:00:27.950> feel<00:00:28.250> like<00:00:28.430> it's

00:00:29.140 --> 00:00:29.150 
what does paragliding feel like it's

00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:42.369 
what does paragliding feel like it's
amazing<00:00:29.690> it's<00:00:29.990> like<00:00:30.020> a<00:00:30.140> dream

00:01:00.579 --> 00:01:03.549 

anything<00:01:01.579> about<00:01:01.760> paragliding<00:01:02.329> is<00:01:02.780> there's<00:01:03.320> no

00:01:03.549 --> 00:01:03.559 
anything about paragliding is there's no

anything about paragliding is there's no
motors<00:01:03.980> there's<00:01:04.550> no<00:01:04.870> ulterior<00:01:05.870> means<00:01:06.290> of

motors there's no ulterior means of

00:01:06.790 --> 00:01:09.520 
motors there's no ulterior means of
flying<00:01:07.790> it's<00:01:08.150> just<00:01:08.390> you<00:01:08.659> and<00:01:09.229> a<00:01:09.320> piece<00:01:09.500> of

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:34.770 

only<00:01:33.070> under<00:01:33.250> the<00:01:33.369> power<00:01:33.579> of<00:01:33.759> the<00:01:33.880> Sun<00:01:34.270> and<00:01:34.689> the

flying high in the mountains I love the
feeling<00:01:54.460> of<00:01:54.720> taking<00:01:55.720> the<00:01:55.810> paraglider<00:01:56.170> and

00:01:56.460 --> 00:01:56.470 
feeling of taking the paraglider and

00:01:56.470 --> 00:01:58.860 
feeling of taking the paraglider and
using<00:01:56.710> it<00:01:56.800> as<00:01:56.890> a<00:01:56.920> tool<00:01:57.280> to<00:01:57.940> come<00:01:58.180> from<00:01:58.450> one<00:01:58.660> end

00:01:58.860 --> 00:01:58.870 
using it as a tool to come from one end

00:01:58.870 --> 00:02:00.210 
using it as a tool to come from one end
to<00:01:58.960> another<00:01:59.020> end<00:01:59.410> of<00:01:59.470> the<00:01:59.530> math<00:01:59.680> range<00:01:59.979> to

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:00.220 
to another end of the math range to

00:02:00.220 --> 00:02:08.719 
to another end of the math range to
really<00:02:00.400> get<00:02:00.550> some<00:02:00.729> distance

00:02:08.719 --> 00:02:08.729 

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:10.910 

when<00:02:09.509> you're<00:02:09.660> flying<00:02:10.020> you're<00:02:10.289> totally<00:02:10.649> in<00:02:10.800> the

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:10.920 
when you're flying you're totally in the

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:12.680 
when you're flying you're totally in the
moment<00:02:11.069> of<00:02:11.340> what<00:02:11.370> you're<00:02:11.610> doing<00:02:11.730> and<00:02:12.090> I<00:02:12.629> think

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:12.690 
moment of what you're doing and I think

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:15.900 
for anyone who has a desire to just get

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:18.199 
for anyone who has a desire to just get
a<00:02:15.930> different<00:02:16.410> perspective<00:02:16.709> on<00:02:17.310> life<00:02:17.370> those

00:02:18.199 --> 00:02:18.209 
a different perspective on life those

00:02:18.209 --> 00:02:31.339 
a different perspective on life those
items<00:02:18.629> probably<00:02:18.989> a<00:02:19.050> good<00:02:19.260> way<00:02:19.440> to<00:02:19.500> do

00:02:31.339 --> 00:02:31.349 

00:02:31.349 --> 00:02:32.959

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:37.280 
about paragliding is it's this amazing
sensation<00:02:35.099> of<00:02:35.819> overcoming<00:02:36.390> gravity<00:02:36.629> or<00:02:37.170> at

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:37.290 
sensation of overcoming gravity or at

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:49.319 
sensation of overcoming gravity or at
least<00:02:37.469> being<00:02:37.650> on<00:02:37.799> equal<00:02:37.950> terms

00:02:49.319 --> 00:02:49.329 

00:02:49.329 --> 00:02:51.149 

I<00:02:49.360> really<00:02:50.049> like<00:02:50.200> the<00:02:50.349> adventure<00:02:50.799> of<00:02:50.829> pair

00:02:51.149 --> 00:02:51.159 
I really like the adventure of pair

00:02:51.159 --> 00:02:52.740 
I really like the adventure of pair
lighting<00:02:51.519> all<00:02:51.670> aspects<00:02:52.209> of<00:02:52.299> it<00:02:52.420> the<00:02:52.540> hiking

00:02:52.740 --> 00:02:52.750 
lighting all aspects of it the hiking

00:02:52.750 --> 00:02:55.410 
lighting all aspects of it the hiking
the<00:02:53.019> climbing<00:02:53.500> the<00:02:53.980> flying<00:02:54.420> the

00:02:55.410 --> 00:02:55.420 
the climbing the flying the

00:02:55.420 --> 00:02:57.839 
the climbing the flying the
decision-making<00:02:56.049> and<00:02:56.950> not<00:02:57.220> really<00:02:57.489> in<00:02:57.610> the

00:02:57.839 --> 00:02:57.849 
decision-making and not really in the

00:02:57.849 --> 00:03:00.750 
decision-making and not really in the
big<00:02:58.030> long<00:02:58.239> distances<00:02:58.930> or<00:02:59.489> acrobatic<00:03:00.489> flights

00:03:00.750 --> 00:03:00.760 
big long distances or acrobatic flights

00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:25.470 
big long distances or acrobatic flights
I<00:03:00.970> like<00:03:01.150> the<00:03:01.299> adventure<00:03:01.390> of<00:03:01.689> it

00:03:27.610 --> 00:03:30.420 
yeah I think there's a few pilots that
have<00:03:27.959> really<00:03:28.959> been<00:03:29.080> instrumental<00:03:29.920> in<00:03:30.250> my
