00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:16.859
 hi to all and heroes i hope you 

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.690
 be fine for me it's going very very 

00:00:16.859 --> 00:00:19.980
 Well today I am very happy to 

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:21.869
 find you I wish you the 

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:23.189
 welcome to this new video for 

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:24.570
 tell you about them I was sitting 

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:26.880
 today I put more precisely 

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:28.800
 you talk about fake trailers about 

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:30.330
 of this next opus as you could 

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:31.859
 see it on my channel youtube I 

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:34.380
 you released a video five days ago 

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:37.079
 where I told you that the trailer will be released 

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:38.520
 obviously a year before the release of this 

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:41.219
 famous game so that means that if the 

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:43.500
 game is coming out in 2019 the trailer would come out in 

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:46.829
 2018 and so on as for example 

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:48.660
 in 2020 the trailer come out and in 2019 

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:50.489
 accompanied by screenshots that follows 

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:52.649
 and why not a second trailer 

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:54.360
 offered by rockstar games is everything 

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:55.890
 just today I have by pure 

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:56.460
 curiosity tap on the bar of 

00:00:55.890 --> 00:00:59.760
 research 

00:00:56.460 --> 00:01:01.890
 rockstar trailer I was at 6 and I'm 

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:03.750
 simply stumbled upon over 500 

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:05.189
 miles result it means there is 

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:07.590
 more than five hundred thousand people so 

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:09.090
 half a million who typed in 

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:10.200
 least once so for example either 

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:12.270
 in their titles either in their 

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:14.880
 description or in their tags 

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:15.960
 video trailer I was at 6 rockstar 

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:17.430
 official etc 

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:19.290
 me what makes me laugh a lot is 

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:22.110
 when people mark official trailer 

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:24.180
 I was sitting 2016 with lots of tags 

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:25.920
 and it's just his videos 

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:27.479
 reach peaks of sight but 

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:28.890
 really huge like for example a 

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:30.000
 million views there is even a video 

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:31.590
 so in fact it's a chain that 

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:33.869
 is called rockstar games something 

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:35.549
 so I believe they have 4000 subscribers 

00:01:33.869 --> 00:01:37.470
 something like that the video did 

00:01:35.549 --> 00:01:39.210
 more than eight million seen you 

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:41.189
 realize 8 million views is 

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:43.229
 almost in fact the number of views that a 

00:01:41.189 --> 00:01:44.670
 singer does on somebody's music 

00:01:43.229 --> 00:01:46.020
 who is barely known is 

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:47.729
 still something enough and no 

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:49.350
 for a video made of a trailer 

00:01:47.729 --> 00:01:51.000
 in quotation marks from a game that does not exist 

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:52.560
 not and they have not taken yet 

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:55.590
 to exist kisses as I have you Gilles 

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:57.540
 go out between 2018 and 2020 which makes 

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:58.170
 still have a lot of time to wait and 

00:01:57.540 --> 00:02:00.570
 as I wanted 

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:02.369
 just at the beginning it takes a year before the 

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:04.710
 official release will see the trailer 

00:02:02.369 --> 00:02:05.700
 and we are far from his one year before 

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:07.590
 the official release 

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:09.720
 because we are in 2015 finally more 

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:11.640
 precisely in August 2015 when I 

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:13.110
 you realize this video and the trailer 

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:15.930
 get out healthy like you 10 a year 

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:18.900
 before the official release as in 2018 

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:20.580
 in 2019 or 2020 then simply 

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:21.959
 this video will aim at you 

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:24.060
 prevent to really do very 

00:02:21.959 --> 00:02:25.260
 watch out for youtube as you could 

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:27.030
 to see it I show you a lot of 

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:28.470
 screen but especially in the background there is a 

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:30.750
 gameplay so this gameplay all 

00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:32.069
 simply a quotation marks trailer 

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:33.930
 I was sitting like some 

00:02:32.069 --> 00:02:35.910
 call him and as some do 

00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:37.410
 videos on it so this trailer I think 

00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:38.940
 that you have seen on a lot of chain 

00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:40.709
 youtube as for example the planet 

00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:42.630
 self or else full of other channels 

00:02:40.709 --> 00:02:44.489
 youtube is just this trailer 

00:02:42.630 --> 00:02:46.620
 in quotation marks would be the next gta 

00:02:44.489 --> 00:02:48.239
 if what would be really beautiful where 

00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:50.130
 we see the ants cross the branch 

00:02:48.239 --> 00:02:52.350
 of tree or send a train smoke 

00:02:50.130 --> 00:02:54.239
 really exceptional for a video game 

00:02:52.350 --> 00:02:56.069
 like lounges in a trailer like that we 

00:02:54.239 --> 00:02:57.780
 are in exclusivity finally must 

00:02:56.069 --> 00:02:58.980
 really stop people really does 

00:02:57.780 --> 00:03:00.269
 be careful when there are some who go 

00:02:58.980 --> 00:03:02.040
 tell me but why do you realize this 

00:03:00.269 --> 00:03:03.840
 video today it's really useless 

00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:05.010
 you have already done one there are a lot of 

00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:06.420
 time so yeah it's true I made 

00:03:05.010 --> 00:03:08.519
 an about eleven months ago now 

00:03:06.420 --> 00:03:10.680
 something like that see if it's not 

00:03:08.519 --> 00:03:12.480
 a year and reaches over 100,000 view and 

00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:13.260
 besides, I really thank you 

00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:14.700
 from the bottom of the heart 

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:16.200
 but today if I do you this 

00:03:14.700 --> 00:03:17.459
 video is simply because despite 

00:03:16.200 --> 00:03:19.380
 the hundred thousand people who saw 

00:03:17.459 --> 00:03:21.390
 this video there is always a lot 

00:03:19.380 --> 00:03:23.730
 videos that are posted every day 

00:03:21.390 --> 00:03:26.519
 on this platform youtube with marked 

00:03:23.730 --> 00:03:29.820
 as title trailer I was sitting 2016 

00:03:26.519 --> 00:03:30.900
 2017 or official trailer rockstar games 

00:03:29.820 --> 00:03:33.420
 is simply 

00:03:30.900 --> 00:03:35.010
 it's unacceptable to go out 

00:03:33.420 --> 00:03:36.660
 thing on a thing that does not exist yet 

00:03:35.010 --> 00:03:37.980
 not and apparently the hundred thousand 

00:03:36.660 --> 00:03:39.780
 people who have seen this video that does not 

00:03:37.980 --> 00:03:41.910
 not enough then I owe it to you 

00:03:39.780 --> 00:03:43.260
 redo one and video like that with this 

00:03:41.910 --> 00:03:44.519
 new trailer that has just been released 

00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:46.769
 I did it to you with the car the 

00:03:44.519 --> 00:03:48.600
 car a little chrome that rolls and who 

00:03:46.769 --> 00:03:50.670
 is now on the entire network 

00:03:48.600 --> 00:03:51.959

00:03:50.670 --> 00:03:53.430
 trailer I was sitting you trained 

00:03:51.959 --> 00:03:54.630

 thing as I wanted to say so with that 

00:03:54.630 --> 00:03:56.940
 the train etc 

00:03:55.440 --> 00:03:59.010
