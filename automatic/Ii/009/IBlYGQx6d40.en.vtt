00:01:59.600 --> 00:01:59.610 
second one out of the three was the I

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:02.330 
second one out of the three was the I
had<00:01:59.759> a<00:01:59.790> PvP<00:02:00.420> basically<00:02:01.200> mission<00:02:01.950> to<00:02:02.040> do<00:02:02.189> in

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:02.340 
had a PvP basically mission to do in

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:05.959 
had a PvP basically mission to do in
this<00:02:02.490> and<00:02:03.860> if<00:02:04.860> I<00:02:05.040> remember<00:02:05.399> right<00:02:05.549> it<00:02:05.700> was<00:02:05.790> just

00:02:05.959 --> 00:02:05.969 
this and if I remember right it was just

00:02:05.969 --> 00:02:09.260 
this and if I remember right it was just
basically<00:02:06.829> collecting<00:02:07.829> from<00:02:08.399> the<00:02:08.819> deaths<00:02:09.060> of

00:02:09.260 --> 00:02:09.270 
basically collecting from the deaths of

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:11.240 
basically collecting from the deaths of
basically<00:02:09.989> had<00:02:10.110> to<00:02:10.170> kill<00:02:10.319> about<00:02:10.410> 500<00:02:10.979> people

00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:11.250 
basically had to kill about 500 people

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:13.280 
basically had to kill about 500 people
in<00:02:11.340> there<00:02:11.550> not<00:02:12.300> very<00:02:12.330> hard<00:02:12.720> if<00:02:12.959> you're<00:02:13.110> getting

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:13.290 
in there not very hard if you're getting

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:14.000 
in there not very hard if you're getting
you<00:02:13.770> know

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:14.010 
you know

00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:19.580 
you know
25:38<00:02:15.000> game<00:02:15.269> it<00:02:16.110> goes<00:02:16.470> by<00:02:16.650> pretty<00:02:16.830> quick<00:02:18.110> and<00:02:19.110> I

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:19.590 
25:38 game it goes by pretty quick and I

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:22.460 
25:38 game it goes by pretty quick and I
think<00:02:20.159> it<00:02:20.310> was<00:02:20.489> using<00:02:20.940> the<00:02:21.060> void<00:02:21.269> that's<00:02:22.260> what

00:02:22.460 --> 00:02:22.470 
think it was using the void that's what

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:27.890 
think it was using the void that's what
it<00:02:22.560> was<00:02:22.650> I<00:02:22.799> had<00:02:22.920> to<00:02:23.010> use<00:02:23.159> the<00:02:23.340> void<00:02:23.580> to<00:02:24.470> to<00:02:26.900> to

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:27.900 
it was I had to use the void to to to

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:28.520 
it was I had to use the void to to to
defeat<00:02:28.230> them

00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:28.530 
defeat them

00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:31.940 
defeat them
so<00:02:29.310> basically<00:02:30.030> I'll<00:02:30.510> also<00:02:30.750> I<00:02:31.290> have<00:02:31.739> another

00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:31.950 
so basically I'll also I have another

00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:33.770 
so basically I'll also I have another
video<00:02:32.129> up<00:02:32.340> about<00:02:32.819> the<00:02:33.120> different<00:02:33.480> kinds<00:02:33.750> of

00:02:33.770 --> 00:02:33.780 
video up about the different kinds of

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:37.280 
video up about the different kinds of
damages<00:02:34.349> and<00:02:34.620> then<00:02:35.549> what<00:02:35.849> how<00:02:36.360> to<00:02:36.870> look<00:02:37.080> for

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:37.290 
damages and then what how to look for

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:40.039 
damages and then what how to look for
that<00:02:37.470> I'll<00:02:37.830> link<00:02:38.190> that<00:02:38.310> into<00:02:38.910> right<00:02:39.269> now<00:02:39.480> so

00:02:40.039 --> 00:02:40.049 
that I'll link that into right now so

00:02:40.049 --> 00:02:43.789 
that I'll link that into right now so
you<00:02:40.110> can<00:02:40.379> take<00:02:40.560> a<00:02:40.590> look<00:02:41.030> and<00:02:42.470> then<00:02:43.470> the<00:02:43.560> last

00:02:43.789 --> 00:02:43.799 
you can take a look and then the last

00:02:43.799 --> 00:02:46.789 
you can take a look and then the last
will<00:02:44.010> be<00:02:44.040> kill<00:02:44.400> X<00:02:44.610> or<00:02:44.819> the<00:02:45.060> unwed<00:02:45.840> and<00:02:46.140> that

00:02:46.789 --> 00:02:46.799 
will be kill X or the unwed and that

00:02:46.799 --> 00:02:48.949 
will be kill X or the unwed and that
will<00:02:46.890> basically<00:02:47.040> give<00:02:47.610> me<00:02:47.640> the<00:02:47.959> corrupted

00:02:48.949 --> 00:02:48.959 
will basically give me the corrupted

00:02:48.959 --> 00:02:51.500 
will basically give me the corrupted
thorn<00:02:49.230> this<00:02:50.160> one<00:02:50.370> was<00:02:50.519> just<00:02:50.819> like<00:02:51.000> I<00:02:51.120> said<00:02:51.360> it

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:51.510 
thorn this one was just like I said it

00:02:51.510 --> 00:02:53.089 
thorn this one was just like I said it
was<00:02:51.599> just<00:02:51.780> through<00:02:52.079> the<00:02:52.170> bounty<00:02:52.560> it<00:02:52.680> was<00:02:52.829> the

00:02:53.089 --> 00:02:53.099 
was just through the bounty it was the

00:02:53.099 --> 00:02:54.559 
was just through the bounty it was the
luck<00:02:53.310> of<00:02:53.430> the<00:02:53.489> draw

00:02:54.559 --> 00:02:54.569 
luck of the draw

00:02:54.569 --> 00:02:56.300 
luck of the draw
but<00:02:54.900> the<00:02:54.989> cryptarch<00:02:55.379> one<00:02:55.590> I<00:02:55.620> do<00:02:55.769> believe

00:02:56.300 --> 00:02:56.310 
but the cryptarch one I do believe

00:02:56.310 --> 00:02:59.390 
but the cryptarch one I do believe
that's<00:02:56.609> that's<00:02:57.030> pertains<00:02:57.660> to<00:02:57.920> how<00:02:58.920> high<00:02:59.190> your

00:02:59.390 --> 00:02:59.400 
that's that's pertains to how high your

00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:00.589 
that's that's pertains to how high your
ranking<00:02:59.760> is<00:02:59.910> you<00:03:00.060> know<00:03:00.150> it's<00:03:00.269> going<00:03:00.299> to<00:03:00.420> give

00:03:00.589 --> 00:03:00.599 
ranking is you know it's going to give

00:03:00.599 --> 00:03:04.180 
ranking is you know it's going to give
you<00:03:00.690> a<00:03:00.720> better<00:03:00.900> chance<00:03:00.989> of<00:03:01.410> what<00:03:02.010> you<00:03:02.160> need

00:03:04.180 --> 00:03:04.190 
you a better chance of what you need

00:03:04.190 --> 00:03:06.920 
you a better chance of what you need
this<00:03:05.190> was<00:03:05.370> just<00:03:05.579> a<00:03:05.700> real<00:03:06.030> high<00:03:06.269> question<00:03:06.780> with

00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:06.930 
this was just a real high question with

00:03:06.930 --> 00:03:08.390 
this was just a real high question with
everybody<00:03:07.290> they<00:03:07.470> all<00:03:07.500> wanted<00:03:07.890> to<00:03:08.010> know<00:03:08.160> kind

everybody they all wanted to know kind

00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:11.300 
everybody they all wanted to know kind
of<00:03:08.609> you<00:03:09.030> know<00:03:09.150> how<00:03:09.480> I<00:03:09.510> got<00:03:09.930> them<00:03:10.190> what's<00:03:11.190> the

00:03:11.300 --> 00:03:11.310 
of you know how I got them what's the

00:03:11.310 --> 00:03:12.800 
of you know how I got them what's the
best<00:03:11.519> way<00:03:11.700> to<00:03:11.730> find<00:03:12.060> them<00:03:12.239> some<00:03:12.450> people<00:03:12.569> are

00:03:12.800 --> 00:03:12.810 
best way to find them some people are

00:03:12.810 --> 00:03:15.410 
best way to find them some people are
farming<00:03:13.200> non-stop<00:03:13.769> that<00:03:14.519> I<00:03:14.549> know<00:03:14.670> and<00:03:15.120> have

00:03:15.410 --> 00:03:15.420 
farming non-stop that I know and have

00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:19.520 
farming non-stop that I know and have
not<00:03:15.599> found<00:03:15.840> one<00:03:15.989> yet<00:03:16.340> I<00:03:17.340> think<00:03:18.329> it's<00:03:18.510> just<00:03:18.780> some

00:03:19.520 --> 00:03:19.530 
not found one yet I think it's just some

00:03:19.530 --> 00:03:20.809 
not found one yet I think it's just some
of<00:03:19.650> it<00:03:19.739> is<00:03:19.859> the<00:03:19.889> luck<00:03:20.190> of<00:03:20.280> the<00:03:20.340> draw

00:03:20.809 --> 00:03:20.819 
of it is the luck of the draw

00:03:20.819 --> 00:03:26.420 
of it is the luck of the draw
but<00:03:21.569> others<00:03:22.849> others<00:03:23.849> are<00:03:24.410> basically<00:03:25.410> just<00:03:25.919> it

00:03:26.420 --> 00:03:26.430 
but others others are basically just it

00:03:26.430 --> 00:03:27.979 
but others others are basically just it
just<00:03:26.609> comes<00:03:26.880> I<00:03:27.120> mean<00:03:27.239> if<00:03:27.329> you<00:03:27.450> have<00:03:27.599> oil
