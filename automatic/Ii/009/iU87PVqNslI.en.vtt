backswing now remember as long as you

00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:33.800 
backswing now remember as long as you
get<00:02:32.040> a<00:02:32.099> good<00:02:32.190> foot<00:02:32.640> below<00:02:32.819> the<00:02:32.940> contact<00:02:33.540> point

get a good foot below the contact point

00:02:33.810 --> 00:02:36.770 
get a good foot below the contact point
as<00:02:33.959> you<00:02:34.290> swing<00:02:34.650> up<00:02:34.890> the<00:02:35.580> racket<00:02:35.849> naturally

got a vertical racket when I'm making
contact<00:02:40.709> with<00:02:41.010> the<00:02:41.129> ball<00:02:41.390> now<00:02:42.390> if<00:02:42.870> I<00:02:43.019> don't

00:02:43.190 --> 00:02:43.200 
contact with the ball now if I don't

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:44.690 
contact with the ball now if I don't
play<00:02:43.410> around<00:02:43.680> with<00:02:43.830> my<00:02:44.010> wrist<00:02:44.280> and<00:02:44.459> forearm

00:02:53.930 --> 00:02:53.940 
notice how the racket is staying

00:02:53.940 --> 00:02:56.240 
notice how the racket is staying
vertical<00:02:54.510> when<00:02:55.200> you<00:02:55.319> make<00:02:55.500> contact<00:02:55.530> with<00:02:56.069> the

ball the balls on the strings for a
millisecond<00:02:58.440> it's<00:02:58.530> gone<00:02:58.799> so<00:02:59.340> there's<00:02:59.519> no<00:02:59.700> need

00:02:59.960 --> 00:02:59.970 
millisecond it's gone so there's no need

millisecond it's gone so there's no need
to<00:03:00.000> do<00:03:00.390> this<00:03:00.599> you<00:03:00.660> don't<00:03:00.870> have<00:03:01.109> to<00:03:01.410> roll<00:03:01.590> over

00:03:02.170 --> 00:03:02.180 
to do this you don't have to roll over

00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:05.119 
to do this you don't have to roll over
just<00:03:03.180> keep<00:03:03.420> going<00:03:03.870> up<00:03:04.049> keep<00:03:04.470> finishing<00:03:04.709> high

00:03:05.119 --> 00:03:05.129 
just keep going up keep finishing high

00:03:05.129 --> 00:03:07.819 
just keep going up keep finishing high
that's<00:03:05.459> going<00:03:05.819> to<00:03:05.940> impart<00:03:06.269> topspin<00:03:06.959> the

00:03:07.819 --> 00:03:07.829 
that's going to impart topspin the

00:03:07.829 --> 00:03:09.349 
that's going to impart topspin the
topspin<00:03:08.430> is<00:03:08.489> what's<00:03:08.790> going<00:03:09.000> to<00:03:09.030> bring<00:03:09.180> the

00:03:09.349 --> 00:03:09.359 
topspin is what's going to bring the

00:03:09.359 --> 00:03:11.630 
topspin is what's going to bring the
ball<00:03:09.540> back<00:03:09.569> down<00:03:09.989> in<00:03:10.170> the<00:03:10.260> court<00:03:10.500> now<00:03:11.310> let's

00:03:11.630 --> 00:03:11.640 
ball back down in the court now let's

00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:13.369 
ball back down in the court now let's
say<00:03:11.819> you're<00:03:12.000> up<00:03:12.120> against<00:03:12.510> the<00:03:12.629> slow<00:03:12.900> second

00:03:13.369 --> 00:03:13.379 
say you're up against the slow second

00:03:13.379 --> 00:03:16.000 
say you're up against the slow second
serve<00:03:13.590> and<00:03:13.890> the<00:03:14.280> ball<00:03:14.519> is<00:03:14.549> sailing<00:03:15.180> long

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:16.010 
serve and the ball is sailing long

00:03:16.010 --> 00:03:19.190 
serve and the ball is sailing long
increase<00:03:17.010> your<00:03:17.280> topspin<00:03:17.910> how<00:03:18.660> do<00:03:18.720> you<00:03:18.870> do<00:03:19.019> that

00:03:19.190 --> 00:03:19.200 
increase your topspin how do you do that

00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:22.160 
increase your topspin how do you do that
you<00:03:19.500> increase<00:03:20.010> the<00:03:20.250> angle<00:03:20.760> of<00:03:20.879> your<00:03:21.060> swing<00:03:21.420> now

00:03:22.160 --> 00:03:22.170 
you increase the angle of your swing now

00:03:22.170 --> 00:03:24.800 
you increase the angle of your swing now
watch<00:03:22.410> I've<00:03:23.220> got<00:03:23.430> a<00:03:23.459> topspin<00:03:24.060> swing<00:03:24.420> here<00:03:24.660> my

00:03:24.800 --> 00:03:24.810 
watch I've got a topspin swing here my

00:03:24.810 --> 00:03:26.900 
watch I've got a topspin swing here my
racket<00:03:25.230> is<00:03:25.349> down<00:03:25.530> low<00:03:25.829> and<00:03:26.069> let's<00:03:26.220> say<00:03:26.400> I<00:03:26.430> swing

00:03:26.900 --> 00:03:26.910 
racket is down low and let's say I swing

00:03:26.910 --> 00:03:30.289 
racket is down low and let's say I swing
up<00:03:27.120> and<00:03:27.739> there's<00:03:28.739> my<00:03:28.980> finish<00:03:29.430> now<00:03:29.880> that's<00:03:30.120> a

00:03:30.289 --> 00:03:30.299 
up and there's my finish now that's a

00:03:30.299 --> 00:03:31.970 
up and there's my finish now that's a
load<00:03:30.540> of<00:03:30.569> high<00:03:30.810> swing<00:03:31.200> and<00:03:31.410> the<00:03:31.470> angle<00:03:31.799> of<00:03:31.859> that

00:03:31.970 --> 00:03:31.980 
load of high swing and the angle of that

00:03:31.980 --> 00:03:33.860 
load of high swing and the angle of that
swing<00:03:32.340> was<00:03:32.370> approximately<00:03:33.299> let's<00:03:33.510> say<00:03:33.690> like

00:03:33.860 --> 00:03:33.870 
swing was approximately let's say like

00:03:33.870 --> 00:03:35.960 
swing was approximately let's say like
this<00:03:34.169> this<00:03:34.769> is<00:03:34.950> the<00:03:35.040> low<00:03:35.190> point<00:03:35.519> of<00:03:35.609> the<00:03:35.700> swing

00:03:35.960 --> 00:03:35.970 
this this is the low point of the swing

00:03:35.970 --> 00:03:38.870 
this this is the low point of the swing
this<00:03:36.569> is<00:03:36.750> the<00:03:36.870> finish<00:03:37.230> now<00:03:38.160> as<00:03:38.430> long<00:03:38.609> as<00:03:38.700> I

00:03:38.870 --> 00:03:38.880 
this is the finish now as long as I

00:03:38.880 --> 00:03:41.270 
this is the finish now as long as I
swing<00:03:39.209> like<00:03:39.419> that<00:03:39.630> low<00:03:39.870> to<00:03:39.930> high<00:03:40.200> I'm<00:03:40.680> going<00:03:41.160> to

00:03:41.270 --> 00:03:41.280 
swing like that low to high I'm going to

00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:43.339 
swing like that low to high I'm going to
impart<00:03:41.669> some<00:03:41.760> forward<00:03:42.419> spin<00:03:42.810> to<00:03:43.049> the<00:03:43.169> ball

00:03:43.339 --> 00:03:43.349 
impart some forward spin to the ball

00:03:43.349 --> 00:03:45.500 
impart some forward spin to the ball
some<00:03:43.620> topspin<00:03:44.190> when<00:03:44.849> you<00:03:44.970> get<00:03:45.120> the<00:03:45.269> ball

00:03:45.500 --> 00:03:45.510 
some topspin when you get the ball

00:03:45.510 --> 00:03:47.930 
some topspin when you get the ball
spinning<00:03:45.930> forward<00:03:46.560> like<00:03:46.769> that<00:03:47.040> it<00:03:47.340> creates

00:03:47.930 --> 00:03:47.940 
spinning forward like that it creates

00:03:47.940 --> 00:03:51.020 
spinning forward like that it creates
air<00:03:48.450> pressure<00:03:48.959> on<00:03:49.290> top<00:03:49.680> of<00:03:49.919> the<00:03:49.980> ball<00:03:50.220> so<00:03:50.819> it's

00:03:51.020 --> 00:03:51.030 
air pressure on top of the ball so it's

00:03:51.030 --> 00:03:53.479 
air pressure on top of the ball so it's
always<00:03:51.359> pushing<00:03:51.660> the<00:03:51.959> ball<00:03:52.169> back<00:03:52.470> down<00:03:52.769> once

00:03:53.479 --> 00:03:53.489 
always pushing the ball back down once

00:03:53.489 --> 00:03:56.809 
always pushing the ball back down once
the<00:03:53.669> ball<00:03:53.880> spins<00:03:54.269> forward<00:03:54.859> okay<00:03:55.859> now<00:03:56.130> if<00:03:56.519> we're

00:03:56.809 --> 00:03:56.819 
the ball spins forward okay now if we're

00:03:56.819 --> 00:03:59.930 
the ball spins forward okay now if we're
hitting<00:03:57.090> long<00:03:57.299> we<00:03:58.139> have<00:03:58.410> to<00:03:58.620> create<00:03:58.919> more<00:03:59.340> spin

00:03:59.930 --> 00:03:59.940 
hitting long we have to create more spin

00:03:59.940 --> 00:04:02.330 
hitting long we have to create more spin
or<00:04:00.319> RPMs<00:04:01.319> we've<00:04:01.650> got<00:04:01.829> to<00:04:01.950> get<00:04:02.069> the<00:04:02.190> ball

00:04:02.330 --> 00:04:02.340 
or RPMs we've got to get the ball

00:04:02.340 --> 00:04:04.400 
or RPMs we've got to get the ball
spinning<00:04:02.910> faster<00:04:03.480> because<00:04:03.989> that's<00:04:04.169> going<00:04:04.349> to

00:04:04.400 --> 00:04:04.410 
spinning faster because that's going to

00:04:04.410 --> 00:04:06.559 
spinning faster because that's going to
create<00:04:04.590> more<00:04:05.099> air<00:04:05.370> pressure<00:04:05.579> to<00:04:06.299> push<00:04:06.540> the

00:04:06.559 --> 00:04:06.569 
create more air pressure to push the

00:04:06.569 --> 00:04:09.259 
create more air pressure to push the
ball<00:04:06.870> down<00:04:06.930> quicker<00:04:07.500> so<00:04:08.310> we<00:04:08.519> increase<00:04:09.030> the

00:04:09.259 --> 00:04:09.269 
ball down quicker so we increase the

00:04:09.269 --> 00:04:11.780 
ball down quicker so we increase the
angle<00:04:09.660> of<00:04:09.780> our<00:04:09.930> swing<00:04:10.290> if<00:04:11.040> you're<00:04:11.280> up<00:04:11.430> against

00:04:11.780 --> 00:04:11.790 
angle of our swing if you're up against

00:04:11.790 --> 00:04:13.369 
angle of our swing if you're up against
the<00:04:11.879> slow<00:04:12.120> server<00:04:12.510> and<00:04:12.720> you're<00:04:12.840> still<00:04:13.169> hitting

00:04:13.369 --> 00:04:13.379 
the slow server and you're still hitting

00:04:13.379 --> 00:04:16.610 
the slow server and you're still hitting
long<00:04:14.269> increase<00:04:15.269> the<00:04:15.510> angle<00:04:15.900> so<00:04:16.049> you<00:04:16.109> start<00:04:16.530> a

00:04:16.610 --> 00:04:16.620 
long increase the angle so you start a

00:04:16.620 --> 00:04:19.430 
long increase the angle so you start a
little<00:04:16.769> lower<00:04:17.070> and<00:04:17.489> you<00:04:18.299> come<00:04:18.599> up<00:04:18.810> quicker<00:04:19.199> you

00:04:19.430 --> 00:04:19.440 
little lower and you come up quicker you

00:04:19.440 --> 00:04:21.800 
little lower and you come up quicker you
swing<00:04:20.190> up<00:04:20.370> on<00:04:20.549> more<00:04:20.789> of<00:04:20.910> an<00:04:21.030> angle<00:04:21.209> let's<00:04:21.660> say

00:04:21.800 --> 00:04:21.810 
swing up on more of an angle let's say

00:04:21.810 --> 00:04:23.779 
swing up on more of an angle let's say
your<00:04:21.989> angle<00:04:22.289> is<00:04:22.320> more<00:04:22.530> like<00:04:22.740> this<00:04:23.010> that's

00:04:23.779 --> 00:04:23.789 
your angle is more like this that's

00:04:23.789 --> 00:04:25.969 
your angle is more like this that's
going<00:04:24.000> to<00:04:24.060> give<00:04:24.240> you<00:04:24.419> more<00:04:24.690> spin<00:04:25.080> more<00:04:25.380> rpms

00:04:25.969 --> 00:04:25.979 
going to give you more spin more rpms

00:04:25.979 --> 00:04:28.520 
going to give you more spin more rpms
and<00:04:26.250> the<00:04:26.610> ball<00:04:26.820> will<00:04:26.970> come<00:04:27.150> down<00:04:27.389> quicker<00:04:27.750> so

00:04:28.520 --> 00:04:28.530 
and the ball will come down quicker so

00:04:28.530 --> 00:04:30.500 
and the ball will come down quicker so
remember<00:04:28.919> that<00:04:28.949> a<00:04:29.099> semi-western<00:04:29.729> grip<00:04:29.760> works

00:04:30.500 --> 00:04:30.510 
remember that a semi-western grip works

00:04:30.510 --> 00:04:33.260 
remember that a semi-western grip works
well<00:04:30.930> against<00:04:31.710> the<00:04:31.800> slow<00:04:32.070> server<00:04:32.460> because<00:04:33.150> you

00:04:33.260 --> 00:04:33.270 
well against the slow server because you

00:04:33.270 --> 00:04:34.940 
well against the slow server because you
don't<00:04:33.539> have<00:04:33.750> to<00:04:33.900> hold<00:04:34.050> back<00:04:34.380> you<00:04:34.560> can<00:04:34.740> take<00:04:34.919> a

00:04:34.940 --> 00:04:34.950 
don't have to hold back you can take a

00:04:34.950 --> 00:04:36.650 
don't have to hold back you can take a
nice<00:04:35.250> healthy<00:04:35.669> swing<00:04:35.909> at<00:04:36.090> the<00:04:36.210> ball

00:04:36.650 --> 00:04:36.660 
nice healthy swing at the ball

00:04:36.660 --> 00:04:39.470 
nice healthy swing at the ball
okay<00:04:37.260> remember<00:04:37.740> if<00:04:37.830> you're<00:04:37.980> too<00:04:38.250> risky<00:04:38.880> or<00:04:39.120> if

00:04:39.470 --> 00:04:39.480 
okay remember if you're too risky or if

00:04:39.480 --> 00:04:41.630 
okay remember if you're too risky or if
you're<00:04:39.630> rolling<00:04:39.930> the<00:04:40.260> forearm<00:04:40.800> when<00:04:41.520> you're

00:04:41.630 --> 00:04:41.640 
you're rolling the forearm when you're

00:04:41.640 --> 00:04:43.670 
you're rolling the forearm when you're
trying<00:04:41.910> to<00:04:42.030> hit<00:04:42.150> that<00:04:42.210> slow<00:04:42.690> serve<00:04:43.050> you're

00:04:43.670 --> 00:04:43.680 
trying to hit that slow serve you're

00:04:43.680 --> 00:04:45.230 
trying to hit that slow serve you're
gonna<00:04:43.770> get<00:04:43.980> all<00:04:44.190> kinds<00:04:44.580> of<00:04:44.640> scenarios

00:04:45.230 --> 00:04:45.240 
gonna get all kinds of scenarios

00:04:45.240 --> 00:04:48.470 
gonna get all kinds of scenarios
remember<00:04:46.220> most<00:04:47.220> players<00:04:47.550> that<00:04:47.880> are<00:04:47.970> risky<00:04:48.360> are

00:04:48.470 --> 00:04:48.480 
remember most players that are risky are

00:04:48.480 --> 00:04:50.060 
remember most players that are risky are
coming<00:04:48.870> into<00:04:49.170> the<00:04:49.260> hitting<00:04:49.500> zone<00:04:49.620> with<00:04:50.040> a

00:04:50.060 --> 00:04:50.070 
coming into the hitting zone with a

00:04:50.070 --> 00:04:53.600 
coming into the hitting zone with a
slightly<00:04:50.520> open<00:04:51.180> racket<00:04:51.570> face<00:04:51.810> now<00:04:52.590> all<00:04:53.310> of

00:04:53.600 --> 00:04:53.610 
slightly open racket face now all of

00:04:53.610 --> 00:04:55.190 
slightly open racket face now all of
these<00:04:53.790> shots<00:04:54.090> are<00:04:54.360> going<00:04:54.510> to<00:04:54.570> go<00:04:54.720> long<00:04:54.930> any

00:04:55.190 --> 00:04:55.200 
these shots are going to go long any

00:04:55.200 --> 00:04:57.260 
these shots are going to go long any
time<00:04:55.500> the<00:04:55.650> rackets<00:04:56.040> laid<00:04:56.310> back<00:04:56.550> slightly<00:04:56.970> it's

00:04:57.260 --> 00:04:57.270 
time the rackets laid back slightly it's

00:04:57.270 --> 00:05:00.070 
time the rackets laid back slightly it's
going<00:04:57.450> to<00:04:57.510> go<00:04:57.630> long<00:04:57.840> so<00:04:58.230> as<00:04:58.470> you<00:04:59.010> start<00:04:59.340> to<00:04:59.550> roll

00:05:00.070 --> 00:05:00.080 
going to go long so as you start to roll

00:05:00.080 --> 00:05:03.080 
going to go long so as you start to roll
okay<00:05:01.080> but<00:05:01.260> all<00:05:01.410> this<00:05:01.560> is<00:05:01.770> long<00:05:02.010> it's<00:05:02.550> all<00:05:02.790> long

okay but all this is long it's all long
until<00:05:03.960> you<00:05:04.110> get<00:05:04.290> to<00:05:04.470> here<00:05:04.740> until<00:05:04.950> you<00:05:05.070> get<00:05:05.190> to

until you get to here until you get to
vertical<00:05:05.790> okay<00:05:06.060> that<00:05:06.210> shot<00:05:06.510> will<00:05:06.690> stay<00:05:06.930> in<00:05:07.170> but

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:08.010 
vertical okay that shot will stay in but

00:05:08.010 --> 00:05:10.040 
vertical okay that shot will stay in but
now<00:05:08.190> you're<00:05:08.430> rolling<00:05:08.640> again<00:05:09.150> and<00:05:09.450> all<00:05:09.870> these

00:05:10.040 --> 00:05:10.050

00:05:33.240 --> 00:05:35.690 
now remember the racket will stay
vertical<00:05:33.600> for<00:05:34.590> a<00:05:34.620> foot<00:05:34.980> to<00:05:35.160> a<00:05:35.190> foot<00:05:35.280> and<00:05:35.550> a<00:05:35.670> half

vertical for a foot to a foot and a half

00:05:35.700 --> 00:05:37.850 
vertical for a foot to a foot and a half
as<00:05:36.210> long<00:05:36.780> as<00:05:36.990> you're<00:05:37.140> swinging<00:05:37.440> from<00:05:37.800> the

00:05:37.850 --> 00:05:37.860 
as long as you're swinging from the

00:05:37.860 --> 00:05:40.910 
as long as you're swinging from the
shoulder<00:05:38.660> the<00:05:39.660> rackets<00:05:40.050> moving<00:05:40.410> on<00:05:40.530> a<00:05:40.560> low<00:05:40.860> to

shoulder the rackets moving on a low to

00:05:40.920 --> 00:05:43.100 
shoulder the rackets moving on a low to
high<00:05:41.190> plane<00:05:41.550> it<00:05:41.850> stays<00:05:42.210> vertical<00:05:42.450> in<00:05:42.900> that

00:05:43.100 --> 00:05:43.110 
high plane it stays vertical in that

00:05:43.110 --> 00:05:44.810 
high plane it stays vertical in that
hitting<00:05:43.410> area<00:05:43.740> for<00:05:44.010> a<00:05:44.040> foot<00:05:44.280> to<00:05:44.460> foot<00:05:44.640> and<00:05:44.700> a

00:05:44.820 --> 00:05:47.450 
hitting area for a foot to foot and a
half<00:05:45.030> so<00:05:46.020> you've<00:05:46.230> got<00:05:46.410> a<00:05:46.440> foot<00:05:46.830> to<00:05:47.040> a<00:05:47.070> foot<00:05:47.130> and
