little<00:00:03.570> bit<00:00:03.659> about<00:00:03.810> the<00:00:03.929> history<00:00:04.259> of<00:00:04.290> SRM<00:00:04.770> when

00:00:05.240 --> 00:00:05.250 
little bit about the history of SRM when

00:00:07.130 --> 00:00:07.140 
when did it start who started it sure

right we have many of athletes find the

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:47.900 
right we have many of athletes find the
value<00:00:44.579> in<00:00:44.760> SRM<00:00:45.239> and<00:00:45.890> will<00:00:46.890> go<00:00:47.039> ahead<00:00:47.280> and<00:00:47.460> make

00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:47.910 
value in SRM and will go ahead and make

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:49.430 
value in SRM and will go ahead and make
the<00:00:48.030> purchase<00:00:48.210> on<00:00:48.510> their<00:00:48.719> own<00:00:48.870> if<00:00:49.110> that's<00:00:49.230> what

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:49.440 
the purchase on their own if that's what

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:50.660 
the purchase on their own if that's what
they<00:00:49.530> choose<00:00:49.739> to<00:00:49.800> use<00:00:50.100> to<00:00:50.129> improve<00:00:50.610> their

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:50.670 
they choose to use to improve their

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:52.819 
they choose to use to improve their
training<00:00:51.149> and<00:00:51.239> racing<00:00:51.570> the<00:00:51.899> crank<00:00:52.170> fits<00:00:52.680> on

00:00:52.819 --> 00:00:52.829 
training and racing the crank fits on

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:54.380 
training and racing the crank fits on
there<00:00:52.980> and<00:00:53.219> the<00:00:53.399> chain<00:00:53.610> rings<00:00:53.820> attached<00:00:54.090> here

00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:54.390 
there and the chain rings attached here

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:56.569 
there and the chain rings attached here
right<00:00:54.570> so<00:00:55.170> this<00:00:55.260> is<00:00:55.320> the<00:00:55.500> inside<00:00:55.949> of<00:00:56.250> it<00:00:56.399> now

00:00:56.569 --> 00:00:56.579 
right so this is the inside of it now

00:00:56.579 --> 00:00:59.930 
right so this is the inside of it now
how<00:00:57.270> exactly<00:00:57.750> do<00:00:58.320> we<00:00:58.350> get<00:00:58.590> power<00:00:58.859> from<00:00:59.340> this<00:00:59.489> so

00:00:59.930 --> 00:00:59.940 
how exactly do we get power from this so

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:01.819 
how exactly do we get power from this so
the<00:01:00.059> four<00:01:00.239> bridges<00:01:00.539> here<00:01:00.960> have<00:01:01.170> string<00:01:01.469> gauges

00:01:01.819 --> 00:01:01.829 
the four bridges here have string gauges

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:03.950 
the four bridges here have string gauges
applied<00:01:02.190> to<00:01:02.370> them<00:01:02.550> and<00:01:02.820> as<00:01:03.300> the<00:01:03.750> rider

00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:03.960 
applied to them and as the rider

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:06.770 
applied to them and as the rider
produces<00:01:04.619> power<00:01:04.830> and<00:01:05.220> torque<00:01:06.060> on<00:01:06.299> the<00:01:06.450> pedals

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:06.780 
produces power and torque on the pedals

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:08.929 
produces power and torque on the pedals
the<00:01:07.049> strain<00:01:07.290> gauge<00:01:07.470> is<00:01:07.619> flex<00:01:07.950> and<00:01:08.250> then<00:01:08.729> power

00:01:08.929 --> 00:01:08.939 
the strain gauge is flex and then power

00:01:08.939 --> 00:01:11.899 
the strain gauge is flex and then power
is<00:01:09.299> calculated<00:01:10.080> using<00:01:10.110> a<00:01:10.650> fairly<00:01:11.369> simple

00:01:11.899 --> 00:01:11.909 
is calculated using a fairly simple

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:14.870 
is calculated using a fairly simple
equation<00:01:12.659> which<00:01:13.200> is<00:01:13.229> how<00:01:13.560> hard<00:01:14.280> the<00:01:14.580> rider's

00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:14.880 
equation which is how hard the rider's

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:18.170 
equation which is how hard the rider's
pedaling<00:01:15.420> multiplied<00:01:15.930> by<00:01:16.200> how<00:01:16.560> fast<00:01:16.920> so<00:01:17.700> SRMs

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:18.180 
pedaling multiplied by how fast so SRMs

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:20.450 
pedaling multiplied by how fast so SRMs
or<00:01:18.390> parameters<00:01:18.930> in<00:01:19.020> racing<00:01:19.619> is<00:01:19.770> a<00:01:20.130> bit<00:01:20.340> of<00:01:20.430> a

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:20.460 
or parameters in racing is a bit of a

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:22.789 
or parameters in racing is a bit of a
hot<00:01:20.640> topic<00:01:20.670> for<00:01:21.180> two<00:01:21.540> reasons<00:01:21.930> I<00:01:22.140> want<00:01:22.619> to<00:01:22.680> take

00:01:22.789 --> 00:01:22.799 
hot topic for two reasons I want to take

00:01:22.799 --> 00:01:25.700 
hot topic for two reasons I want to take
the<00:01:22.890> first<00:01:23.159> one<00:01:23.280> which<00:01:24.180> is<00:01:24.210> that<00:01:24.930> people<00:01:25.590> have

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:25.710 
the first one which is that people have

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:27.679 
the first one which is that people have
argued<00:01:25.860> in<00:01:26.130> the<00:01:26.220> past<00:01:26.250> that<00:01:26.880> the<00:01:27.150> particularly

00:01:27.679 --> 00:01:27.689 
argued in the past that the particularly

00:01:27.689 --> 00:01:29.510 
argued in the past that the particularly
Team<00:01:27.810> Sky<00:01:28.170> they<00:01:28.560> use<00:01:28.770> that<00:01:28.950> ice<00:01:29.040> around<00:01:29.189> so

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:29.520 
Team Sky they use that ice around so

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:31.999 
Team Sky they use that ice around so
much<00:01:29.700> as<00:01:30.060> part<00:01:30.240> of<00:01:30.299> their<00:01:30.479> tactics<00:01:30.990> that<00:01:31.860> they

00:01:31.999 --> 00:01:32.009 
much as part of their tactics that they

00:01:32.009 --> 00:01:34.819 
much as part of their tactics that they
they<00:01:32.310> can<00:01:32.340> kind<00:01:32.640> of<00:01:32.670> crush<00:01:33.030> the<00:01:33.450> the<00:01:33.900> racing

00:01:34.819 --> 00:01:34.829 
they can kind of crush the the racing

00:01:34.829 --> 00:01:37.130 
they can kind of crush the the racing
side<00:01:35.549> of<00:01:35.759> things<00:01:35.939> part<00:01:36.420> of<00:01:36.509> the<00:01:36.570> tactics<00:01:36.990> is

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:37.140 
side of things part of the tactics is

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:39.020 
side of things part of the tactics is
yes<00:01:37.380> maybe<00:01:37.650> using<00:01:37.890> a<00:01:38.009> power<00:01:38.220> meter<00:01:38.430> a<00:01:38.640> lot<00:01:38.939> of

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:39.030 
yes maybe using a power meter a lot of

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:40.520 
yes maybe using a power meter a lot of
times<00:01:39.210> you<00:01:39.390> can't<00:01:39.600> depend<00:01:39.840> just<00:01:40.110> on<00:01:40.380> the

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:40.530 
times you can't depend just on the

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:43.160 
times you can't depend just on the
numbers<00:01:40.860> and<00:01:41.070> so<00:01:41.670> yeah<00:01:42.030> like<00:01:42.360> easy<00:01:42.689> from<00:01:42.930> using

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:43.170 
numbers and so yeah like easy from using

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:44.960 
numbers and so yeah like easy from using
looking<00:01:43.799> at<00:01:43.920> the<00:01:44.009> power<00:01:44.220> meter<00:01:44.340> because<00:01:44.549> he

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:44.970 
looking at the power meter because he

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:46.999 
looking at the power meter because he
does<00:01:45.149> he<00:01:45.299> knows<00:01:45.479> his<00:01:45.659> limits<00:01:46.020> and<00:01:46.200> if<00:01:46.799> you<00:01:46.890> go

00:01:46.999 --> 00:01:47.009 
does he knows his limits and if you go

00:01:47.009 --> 00:01:48.440 
does he knows his limits and if you go
above<00:01:47.250> those<00:01:47.399> limits<00:01:47.820> for<00:01:47.939> an<00:01:48.030> extended

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:48.450 
above those limits for an extended

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:48.980 
above those limits for an extended
period<00:01:48.479> of<00:01:48.750> time

00:01:48.980 --> 00:01:48.990 
period of time

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:51.109 
period of time
you<00:01:49.320> can<00:01:49.470> lose<00:01:50.130> a<00:01:50.189> race<00:01:50.399> I<00:01:50.610> mean<00:01:50.729> you<00:01:50.790> can<00:01:50.939> lose

00:01:51.109 --> 00:01:51.119 
you can lose a race I mean you can lose

00:01:51.119 --> 00:01:53.149 
you can lose a race I mean you can lose
precious<00:01:51.509> time<00:01:51.659> by<00:01:52.020> blowing<00:01:52.439> up<00:01:52.619> so<00:01:52.860> he<00:01:52.979> knows

00:01:53.149 --> 00:01:53.159 
precious time by blowing up so he knows

00:01:53.159 --> 00:01:54.710 
precious time by blowing up so he knows
that<00:01:53.280> he<00:01:53.460> feasts<00:01:53.700> days<00:01:53.880> of<00:01:54.000> this<00:01:54.090> limit<00:01:54.450> he<00:01:54.570> can

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:54.720 
that he feasts days of this limit he can

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:56.660 
that he feasts days of this limit he can
ride<00:01:54.899> for<00:01:55.110> this<00:01:55.290> amount<00:01:55.530> of<00:01:55.590> time<00:01:55.649> and<00:01:56.130> that's

00:01:56.660 --> 00:01:56.670 
ride for this amount of time and that's

00:01:56.670 --> 00:01:58.399 
ride for this amount of time and that's
the<00:01:56.790> way<00:01:56.939> that<00:01:57.119> the<00:01:57.390> team<00:01:57.540> approaches<00:01:58.079> if<00:01:58.290> they

00:01:58.399 --> 00:01:58.409 
the way that the team approaches if they

00:01:58.409 --> 00:01:59.929 
the way that the team approaches if they
but<00:01:58.950> I<00:01:58.979> think<00:01:59.189> there's<00:01:59.340> a<00:01:59.430> lot<00:01:59.549> more<00:01:59.700> to<00:01:59.909> it

00:01:59.929 --> 00:01:59.939 
but I think there's a lot more to it

00:01:59.939 --> 00:02:02.359 
but I think there's a lot more to it
than<00:02:00.180> that<00:02:00.240> and<00:02:00.600> it's<00:02:01.140> a<00:02:01.259> style<00:02:01.500> riding<00:02:01.979> -

00:02:02.359 --> 00:02:02.369 
than that and it's a style riding -

00:02:02.369 --> 00:02:03.709 
than that and it's a style riding -
because<00:02:02.759> he's<00:02:02.969> a<00:02:03.000> type<00:02:03.270> of<00:02:03.299> rider

00:02:03.709 --> 00:02:03.719 
because he's a type of rider

00:02:03.719 --> 00:02:05.749 
because he's a type of rider
that<00:02:04.170> needs<00:02:04.439> to<00:02:04.619> be<00:02:04.680> more<00:02:05.070> sustained<00:02:05.460> and<00:02:05.640> more

00:02:05.749 --> 00:02:05.759 
that needs to be more sustained and more

00:02:05.759 --> 00:02:06.830 
that needs to be more sustained and more
control<00:02:06.149> he<00:02:06.329> doesn't<00:02:06.600> have<00:02:06.719> the

00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:06.840 
control he doesn't have the

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:08.900 
control he doesn't have the
explosiveness<00:02:07.439> that<00:02:07.829> other<00:02:08.009> teams<00:02:08.340> have<00:02:08.610> like

00:02:08.900 --> 00:02:08.910 
explosiveness that other teams have like

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:10.279 
explosiveness that other teams have like
I<00:02:09.030> think<00:02:09.090> it<00:02:09.270> was<00:02:09.300> a<00:02:09.420> big<00:02:09.599> issue<00:02:09.750> at<00:02:09.959> the<00:02:10.050> Giro

00:02:10.279 --> 00:02:10.289 
I think it was a big issue at the Giro

00:02:10.289 --> 00:02:12.140 
I think it was a big issue at the Giro
with<00:02:10.619> me<00:02:10.770> believe<00:02:11.039> but<00:02:11.520> it's<00:02:11.670> a<00:02:11.700> completely

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:12.150 
with me believe but it's a completely

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:13.280 
with me believe but it's a completely
different<00:02:12.360> riding<00:02:12.810> style

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:13.290 
different riding style

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:15.679 
different riding style
Italians<00:02:13.769> tend<00:02:14.129> to<00:02:14.250> accelerate<00:02:14.610> more<00:02:15.030> have<00:02:15.659> a

00:02:15.679 --> 00:02:15.689 
Italians tend to accelerate more have a

00:02:15.689 --> 00:02:18.170 
Italians tend to accelerate more have a
big<00:02:16.049> explosion<00:02:16.769> you<00:02:17.310> know<00:02:17.370> they<00:02:17.730> just<00:02:17.760> really

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:18.180 
big explosion you know they just really

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:20.119 
big explosion you know they just really
attack<00:02:18.480> and<00:02:18.750> aggressive<00:02:19.290> similar<00:02:19.769> style<00:02:20.069> to

00:02:20.119 --> 00:02:20.129 
attack and aggressive similar style to

00:02:20.129 --> 00:02:22.880 
attack and aggressive similar style to
Contador<00:02:20.730> and<00:02:20.879> with<00:02:21.569> sky<00:02:21.810> they're<00:02:22.590> not<00:02:22.769> gonna

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:22.890 
Contador and with sky they're not gonna

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:24.920 
Contador and with sky they're not gonna
be<00:02:22.950> able<00:02:23.010> compete<00:02:23.400> at<00:02:23.609> that<00:02:24.209> with<00:02:24.540> those<00:02:24.689> types

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:24.930 
be able compete at that with those types

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:26.509 
be able compete at that with those types
of<00:02:25.019> tactics<00:02:25.260> so<00:02:25.590> they<00:02:25.709> have<00:02:25.890> to<00:02:26.010> control<00:02:26.370> the

00:02:26.509 --> 00:02:26.519 
of tactics so they have to control the

00:02:26.519 --> 00:02:28.759 
of tactics so they have to control the
race<00:02:26.700> in<00:02:27.299> order<00:02:27.599> to<00:02:27.750> control<00:02:28.290> the<00:02:28.560> intensity

00:02:28.759 --> 00:02:28.769 
race in order to control the intensity

00:02:28.769 --> 00:02:30.800 
race in order to control the intensity
levels<00:02:29.280> and<00:02:29.519> keep<00:02:29.730> these<00:02:29.970> guys<00:02:30.120> from<00:02:30.450> having

00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:30.810 
levels and keep these guys from having

00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:33.440 
levels and keep these guys from having
these<00:02:30.930> explosive<00:02:31.829> attacks<00:02:32.239> now<00:02:33.239> there

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:33.450 
these explosive attacks now there

00:02:33.450 --> 00:02:35.929 
these explosive attacks now there
there's<00:02:33.810> another<00:02:33.870> side<00:02:34.739> you're<00:02:35.730> claiming

00:02:35.929 --> 00:02:35.939 
there's another side you're claiming

00:02:35.939 --> 00:02:38.300 
there's another side you're claiming
that<00:02:36.150> you<00:02:36.269> can<00:02:36.510> use<00:02:36.659> the<00:02:36.810> power<00:02:36.989> data<00:02:37.290> you<00:02:38.220> know

00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:38.310 
that you can use the power data you know

00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:40.220 
that you can use the power data you know
and<00:02:38.609> and<00:02:38.909> look<00:02:39.180> and<00:02:39.359> see<00:02:39.689> whether<00:02:39.840> someone's

00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:40.230 
and and look and see whether someone's

00:02:40.230 --> 00:02:42.199 
and and look and see whether someone's
doping<00:02:40.560> or<00:02:40.680> not<00:02:40.859> I<00:02:41.040> think<00:02:41.280> it's<00:02:41.489> difficult<00:02:41.730> to

00:02:42.199 --> 00:02:42.209 
doping or not I think it's difficult to

00:02:42.209 --> 00:02:44.270 
doping or not I think it's difficult to
take<00:02:42.420> a<00:02:42.450> stage<00:02:42.840> of<00:02:43.109> any<00:02:43.319> race<00:02:43.590> and<00:02:43.920> say<00:02:44.069> that

00:02:44.270 --> 00:02:44.280 
take a stage of any race and say that

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:46.429 
take a stage of any race and say that
riders<00:02:44.670> doing<00:02:45.209> one<00:02:45.569> thing<00:02:45.599> or<00:02:45.870> another<00:02:45.930> based

00:02:46.429 --> 00:02:46.439 
riders doing one thing or another based

00:02:46.439 --> 00:02:48.470 
riders doing one thing or another based
on<00:02:46.590> their<00:02:46.769> power<00:02:46.950> output<00:02:47.400> I<00:02:47.609> think<00:02:48.120> that<00:02:48.269> they

00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:48.480 
on their power output I think that they

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:50.210 
on their power output I think that they
would<00:02:48.930> need<00:02:49.049> information<00:02:49.709> that's<00:02:50.010> collected

00:02:50.210 --> 00:02:50.220 
would need information that's collected

00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:52.399 
would need information that's collected
over<00:02:50.579> the<00:02:50.639> course<00:02:50.849> of<00:02:51.000> a<00:02:51.090> season<00:02:51.269> and<00:02:51.629> then<00:02:52.139> or

00:02:52.399 --> 00:02:52.409 
over the course of a season and then or

00:02:52.409 --> 00:02:55.009 
over the course of a season and then or
course<00:02:53.280> of<00:02:53.430> years<00:02:53.819> and<00:02:54.090> so<00:02:54.359> I<00:02:54.389> think<00:02:54.810> yeah<00:02:54.959> if

00:02:55.009 --> 00:02:55.019 
course of years and so I think yeah if

00:02:55.019 --> 00:02:56.780 
course of years and so I think yeah if
they<00:02:55.200> want<00:02:55.409> to<00:02:55.470> start<00:02:55.680> utilizing<00:02:55.889> that

00:02:56.780 --> 00:02:56.790 
they want to start utilizing that

00:02:56.790 --> 00:02:58.729 
they want to start utilizing that
information<00:02:57.419> then<00:02:58.079> it<00:02:58.470> should<00:02:58.709> be

00:02:58.729 --> 00:02:58.739 
information then it should be

00:02:58.739 --> 00:03:01.399 
information then it should be
implemented<00:02:59.189> but<00:02:59.849> it<00:03:00.000> needs<00:03:00.209> to<00:03:00.419> be<00:03:00.659> tracked

00:03:01.399 --> 00:03:01.409 
implemented but it needs to be tracked

00:03:01.409 --> 00:03:03.589 
implemented but it needs to be tracked
on<00:03:01.709> a<00:03:01.829> daily<00:03:02.519> basis<00:03:02.909> more<00:03:03.060> less<00:03:03.239> or<00:03:03.389> like

00:03:03.589 --> 00:03:03.599 
on a daily basis more less or like

00:03:03.599 --> 00:03:06.530 
on a daily basis more less or like
looking<00:03:03.900> at<00:03:03.989> it<00:03:04.169> you<00:03:04.470> know<00:03:04.560> seasonal<00:03:05.540> remember

00:03:06.530 --> 00:03:06.540 
looking at it you know seasonal remember

00:03:06.540 --> 00:03:08.449 
looking at it you know seasonal remember
that<00:03:06.659> the<00:03:06.780> block<00:03:06.989> of<00:03:07.169> training<00:03:07.560> whether<00:03:08.220> it's

00:03:08.449 --> 00:03:08.459 
that the block of training whether it's

00:03:08.459 --> 00:03:10.940 
that the block of training whether it's
course<00:03:08.939> of<00:03:09.120> a<00:03:09.180> year<00:03:09.239> and<00:03:09.750> then<00:03:10.319> you<00:03:10.500> can<00:03:10.680> really

00:03:10.940 --> 00:03:10.950 
course of a year and then you can really

00:03:10.950 --> 00:03:12.710 
course of a year and then you can really
see<00:03:11.159> whether<00:03:11.400> what<00:03:11.760> the<00:03:11.879> riders<00:03:12.209> doing<00:03:12.510> here

00:03:12.710 --> 00:03:12.720 
see whether what the riders doing here

00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:14.509 
see whether what the riders doing here
we<00:03:12.780> get<00:03:12.870> a<00:03:12.930> better<00:03:13.109> idea<00:03:13.200> but<00:03:13.950> same<00:03:14.129> thing<00:03:14.159> it's

00:03:14.509 --> 00:03:14.519 
we get a better idea but same thing it's

00:03:14.519 --> 00:03:15.679 
we get a better idea but same thing it's
it's<00:03:14.790> you<00:03:15.090> need<00:03:15.209> to<00:03:15.329> leave<00:03:15.480> that<00:03:15.540> to<00:03:15.659> the

00:03:15.679 --> 00:03:15.689 
it's you need to leave that to the

00:03:15.689 --> 00:03:17.089 
it's you need to leave that to the
scientist<00:03:16.260> because<00:03:16.500> I<00:03:16.709> think<00:03:16.889> there's<00:03:17.010> so

00:03:17.089 --> 00:03:17.099 
scientist because I think there's so
