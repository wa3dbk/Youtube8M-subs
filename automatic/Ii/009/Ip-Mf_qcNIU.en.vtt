00:00:58.280 --> 00:01:03.079
 that fish consumption has been 

00:01:00.230 --> 00:01:05.900
 related in many studies with 

00:01:03.079 --> 00:01:08.270
 benefits for the heart because the 

00:01:05.900 --> 00:01:10.670
 fish is an animal protein that is 

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:12.680
 high in omega 3 content and the omega 

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:15.650
 3 has been related in the same way to 

00:01:12.680 --> 00:01:17.990

 fluid in the body has also been 

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:28.880
 related to fewer heart attacks with what 

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:31.520
 It helps people who have diabetes 

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:32.840
 then consume fish is very good 

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:36.070
 for the health of you in house what 

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:38.509
 they could supply not instead of eating chicken 

00:01:36.070 --> 00:01:41.420
 more often then eat fish more 

00:01:38.509 --> 00:01:45.160

00:01:51.580 --> 00:01:55.110
 of salt and pepper 

00:01:56.030 --> 00:02:02.469
