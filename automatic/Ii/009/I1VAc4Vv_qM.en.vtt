00:04:52.730 --> 00:04:54.550 
primarily a defensive midfielder but now
he's<00:04:52.940> played<00:04:53.210> with<00:04:53.330> Colorado<00:04:53.840> and<00:04:54.140> he<00:04:54.200> plays

00:04:54.550 --> 00:04:54.560 
he's played with Colorado and he plays

00:04:54.560 --> 00:04:56.020 
he's played with Colorado and he plays
more<00:04:54.770> like<00:04:54.830> a<00:04:54.980> number<00:04:55.280> 10<00:04:55.490> or<00:04:55.640> an<00:04:55.730> attacking

00:04:56.020 --> 00:04:56.030 
more like a number 10 or an attacking

00:04:56.030 --> 00:04:59.140 
more like a number 10 or an attacking
role<00:04:56.390> and<00:04:56.630> I<00:04:57.260> think<00:04:57.530> his<00:04:57.680> versatility<00:04:58.310> and<00:04:58.550> his

00:04:59.140 --> 00:04:59.150 
role and I think his versatility and his

00:04:59.150 --> 00:05:02.140 
role and I think his versatility and his
you<00:05:00.110> know<00:05:00.200> ability<00:05:01.010> on<00:05:01.160> the<00:05:01.310> ball<00:05:01.550> along<00:05:02.120> with

00:05:02.140 --> 00:05:02.150 
you know ability on the ball along with

00:05:02.150 --> 00:05:04.720 
you know ability on the ball along with
his<00:05:02.540> athleticism<00:05:03.080> he's<00:05:03.500> a<00:05:03.530> strong<00:05:04.010> guy<00:05:04.070> he's

00:05:04.720 --> 00:05:04.730 
his athleticism he's a strong guy he's

00:05:04.730 --> 00:05:07.060 
his athleticism he's a strong guy he's
got<00:05:04.940> some<00:05:05.210> mobility<00:05:05.540> so<00:05:06.020> I<00:05:06.290> think<00:05:06.770> he<00:05:06.890> can

00:05:07.060 --> 00:05:07.070 
got some mobility so I think he can

00:05:07.070 --> 00:05:09.430 
got some mobility so I think he can
match<00:05:07.370> the<00:05:08.000> demands<00:05:08.420> physically<00:05:09.080> of<00:05:09.170> what<00:05:09.320> the

00:05:09.430 --> 00:05:09.440 
match the demands physically of what the

00:05:09.440 --> 00:05:12.220 
match the demands physically of what the
international<00:05:10.070> game<00:05:10.280> is<00:05:10.460> as<00:05:10.670> well<00:05:11.270> as<00:05:11.600> play

00:06:02.020 --> 00:06:02.030 
international game and you know with the

00:06:02.030 --> 00:06:03.820 
international game and you know with the
23s<00:06:02.660> and<00:06:02.900> then<00:06:02.990> moving<00:06:03.170> forward<00:06:03.560> with<00:06:03.710> the

00:06:03.820 --> 00:06:03.830 
23s and then moving forward with the

00:06:03.830 --> 00:06:05.770 
23s and then moving forward with the
national<00:06:04.190> team<00:06:04.250> and<00:06:04.580> if<00:06:05.000> that's<00:06:05.210> the<00:06:05.420> case<00:06:05.570> I

00:06:05.770 --> 00:06:05.780 
national team and if that's the case I

00:06:05.780 --> 00:06:07.270 
national team and if that's the case I
think<00:06:06.020> he<00:06:06.140> can<00:06:06.290> be<00:06:06.380> a<00:06:06.410> major<00:06:06.620> contributor<00:06:07.100> at

think he can be a major contributor at

00:06:07.280 --> 00:06:08.440 
think he can be a major contributor at
the<00:06:07.340> next<00:06:07.550> world<00:06:07.730> cup<00:06:07.850> I<00:06:08.030> think<00:06:08.240> the<00:06:08.300> biggest

00:06:08.440 --> 00:06:08.450 
the next world cup I think the biggest

00:06:08.450 --> 00:06:09.970 
the next world cup I think the biggest
thing<00:06:08.600> for<00:06:08.690> him<00:06:08.960> is<00:06:08.990> he<00:06:09.260> needs<00:06:09.530> to<00:06:09.740> start

00:06:09.970 --> 00:06:09.980 
thing for him is he needs to start
