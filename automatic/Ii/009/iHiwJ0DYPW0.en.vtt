over all right so here's a look at the

00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:58.039 
over all right so here's a look at the
boat<00:02:53.489> now<00:02:54.920> what<00:02:55.920> I<00:02:56.599> noticed<00:02:57.599> right<00:02:57.659> off<00:02:57.780> the

00:02:58.039 --> 00:02:58.049 
boat now what I noticed right off the

00:02:58.049 --> 00:03:03.349 
boat now what I noticed right off the
bat<00:02:58.230> is<00:02:58.500> uh<00:02:59.989> it<00:03:00.989> says<00:03:01.400> dynamite<00:03:02.400> in<00:03:02.639> spectrum

00:03:03.349 --> 00:03:03.359 
bat is uh it says dynamite in spectrum

00:03:03.359 --> 00:03:06.490 
bat is uh it says dynamite in spectrum
but<00:03:03.689> I<00:03:03.900> don't<00:03:04.170> believe<00:03:04.439> this<00:03:04.590> is<00:03:04.650> actually<00:03:05.250> a

00:03:06.490 --> 00:03:06.500 
but I don't believe this is actually a

00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:10.520 
but I don't believe this is actually a
idea<00:03:07.500> some<00:03:08.720> frequency<00:03:09.720> that<00:03:09.780> you<00:03:09.870> can<00:03:10.019> bind<00:03:10.319> to

00:03:10.520 --> 00:03:10.530 
idea some frequency that you can bind to

00:03:10.530 --> 00:03:13.119 
idea some frequency that you can bind to
your<00:03:10.560> dsm<00:03:11.099> radios<00:03:11.489> i<00:03:11.760> could<00:03:12.420> be<00:03:12.569> wrong<00:03:12.750> but<00:03:12.810> uh

00:03:13.119 --> 00:03:13.129 
your dsm radios i could be wrong but uh

00:03:13.129 --> 00:03:15.410 
your dsm radios i could be wrong but uh
from<00:03:14.129> what<00:03:14.280> i<00:03:14.310> understand<00:03:14.700> it's<00:03:14.970> not<00:03:15.150> because

00:03:15.410 --> 00:03:15.420 
from what i understand it's not because

00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:18.740 
from what i understand it's not because
the<00:03:15.659> esc<00:03:16.200> and<00:03:16.379> speaker<00:03:17.340> trailer<00:03:17.819> is<00:03:18.150> all<00:03:18.540> on

00:03:18.740 --> 00:03:18.750 
the esc and speaker trailer is all on

00:03:18.750 --> 00:03:21.619 
the esc and speaker trailer is all on
one<00:03:19.019> so<00:03:19.739> that's<00:03:19.859> all<00:03:20.069> look<00:03:20.970> at<00:03:21.090> the<00:03:21.239> inside<00:03:21.599> of

00:03:21.619 --> 00:03:21.629 
one so that's all look at the inside of

00:03:21.629 --> 00:03:24.439 
one so that's all look at the inside of
the<00:03:21.840> boat<00:03:22.049> there<00:03:22.819> it's<00:03:23.819> got<00:03:24.000> it's<00:03:24.150> a<00:03:24.209> little

the battery so you can have a secure
more<00:03:44.549> secure<00:03:44.970> when<00:03:45.209> it's<00:03:45.359> inside<00:03:45.659> there

00:03:46.159 --> 00:03:46.169 
more secure when it's inside there

00:03:46.169 --> 00:03:50.420 
more secure when it's inside there
inside<00:03:46.620> the<00:03:46.739> boat<00:03:47.690> underneath<00:03:48.690> it<00:03:49.220> it's<00:03:50.220> a

inside the boat underneath it it's a

00:03:50.430 --> 00:03:54.530 
inside the boat underneath it it's a
nice<00:03:51.389> finish<00:03:51.780> it's<00:03:51.989> got<00:03:52.819> the<00:03:53.819> intake<00:03:54.239> for<00:03:54.449> the

00:04:00.379 --> 00:04:00.389 
here on on the side here one thing that

00:04:00.389 --> 00:04:03.259 
here on on the side here one thing that
i<00:04:00.449> had<00:04:00.540> noticed<00:04:00.870> that<00:04:01.340> it<00:04:02.340> showed<00:04:02.940> on<00:04:03.209> the

00:04:03.259 --> 00:04:03.269 
i had noticed that it showed on the

00:04:03.269 --> 00:04:07.069 
i had noticed that it showed on the
packaging<00:04:03.900> was<00:04:04.019> that<00:04:04.229> these<00:04:05.810> tabs<00:04:06.810> are

00:04:07.069 --> 00:04:07.079 
packaging was that these tabs are

00:04:07.079 --> 00:04:09.170 
packaging was that these tabs are
actually<00:04:07.409> plastic<00:04:07.709> but<00:04:08.280> that's<00:04:08.519> good<00:04:08.909> to<00:04:09.030> see

00:04:09.170 --> 00:04:09.180 
actually plastic but that's good to see

00:04:09.180 --> 00:04:11.680 
actually plastic but that's good to see
that<00:04:09.209> they're<00:04:09.449> all<00:04:09.479> metal<00:04:09.959> this<00:04:10.829> one<00:04:11.010> here<00:04:11.250> has

00:04:11.680 --> 00:04:11.690 
that they're all metal this one here has

00:04:11.690 --> 00:04:13.969 
that they're all metal this one here has
slight<00:04:12.690> bending<00:04:13.019> in<00:04:13.199> it's<00:04:13.440> perforated<00:04:13.799> i

00:04:13.969 --> 00:04:13.979 
slight bending in it's perforated i

00:04:22.039 --> 00:04:22.049 
that these ones you can bend a little

00:04:22.049 --> 00:04:25.040 
that these ones you can bend a little
bit<00:04:22.139> if<00:04:22.229> you<00:04:22.260> want<00:04:22.349> but<00:04:23.010> for<00:04:23.820> now<00:04:24.000> it's<00:04:24.840> got<00:04:25.020> a

when<00:04:39.450> you<00:04:39.540> can<00:04:39.660> look<00:04:39.780> at<00:04:39.870> my<00:04:39.960> channel<00:04:40.290> on

00:04:40.340 --> 00:04:40.350 
when you can look at my channel on

00:04:40.350 --> 00:04:42.020 
when you can look at my channel on
search<00:04:40.560> sterics<00:04:41.070> and<00:04:41.250> you'll<00:04:41.340> see<00:04:41.520> that<00:04:41.670> I<00:04:41.730> had

00:04:42.020 --> 00:04:42.030 
search sterics and you'll see that I had

00:04:42.030 --> 00:04:44.960 
search sterics and you'll see that I had
that<00:04:42.240> and<00:04:42.390> did<00:04:42.570> an<00:04:42.690> unboxing<00:04:42.960> for<00:04:43.380> it<00:04:43.530> and<00:04:43.970> I

00:04:44.960 --> 00:04:44.970 
that and did an unboxing for it and I

00:04:44.970 --> 00:04:46.880 
that and did an unboxing for it and I
was<00:04:45.840> a<00:04:45.870> little<00:04:46.110> concerned<00:04:46.470> that<00:04:46.530> it<00:04:46.680> would<00:04:46.770> be

00:04:46.880 --> 00:04:46.890 
was a little concerned that it would be

00:04:46.890 --> 00:04:48.800 
was a little concerned that it would be
very<00:04:47.100> similar<00:04:47.400> to<00:04:47.670> the<00:04:47.760> sterics<00:04:48.150> and<00:04:48.330> quality

00:04:48.800 --> 00:04:48.810 
very similar to the sterics and quality

00:04:48.810 --> 00:04:50.870 
very similar to the sterics and quality
but<00:04:48.990> this<00:04:49.110> actually<00:04:49.440> seems<00:04:49.680> to<00:04:49.770> feel<00:04:50.100> a<00:04:50.340> little

00:04:50.870 --> 00:04:50.880 
but this actually seems to feel a little

00:04:50.880 --> 00:04:53.540 
but this actually seems to feel a little
bit<00:04:51.060> better<00:04:51.270> it<00:04:51.600> actually<00:04:51.630> feels<00:04:52.200> like<00:04:52.550> more

00:04:53.540 --> 00:04:53.550 
bit better it actually feels like more

00:04:53.550 --> 00:04:57.070 
bit better it actually feels like more
of<00:04:53.580> a<00:04:53.850> hobby<00:04:54.060> grade<00:04:54.360> then<00:04:54.750> the<00:04:55.110> sterics<00:04:55.770> did

00:04:57.070 --> 00:04:57.080 
of a hobby grade then the sterics did

00:04:57.080 --> 00:05:00.440 
of a hobby grade then the sterics did
and<00:04:58.400> although<00:04:59.400> it's<00:04:59.730> supposed<00:05:00.180> to<00:05:00.240> be<00:05:00.360> the

00:05:00.440 --> 00:05:00.450 
and although it's supposed to be the

00:05:00.450 --> 00:05:01.820 
and although it's supposed to be the
same<00:05:00.660> size<00:05:00.870> this<00:05:01.080> one's<00:05:01.260> a<00:05:01.350> little<00:05:01.470> bit<00:05:01.650> more

00:05:01.820 --> 00:05:01.830 
same size this one's a little bit more

00:05:01.830 --> 00:05:03.320 
same size this one's a little bit more
robust<00:05:02.280> a<00:05:02.310> little<00:05:02.640> bit<00:05:02.730> wider<00:05:03.000> it<00:05:03.210> is<00:05:03.300> a

00:05:03.320 --> 00:05:03.330 
robust a little bit wider it is a

00:05:03.330 --> 00:05:07.220 
robust a little bit wider it is a
catamaran<00:05:03.770> versus<00:05:04.770> the<00:05:04.860> deep<00:05:05.070> V<00:05:05.570> but<00:05:06.570> a<00:05:06.870> lot<00:05:07.110> of

00:05:07.220 --> 00:05:07.230 
catamaran versus the deep V but a lot of

00:05:07.230 --> 00:05:12.140 
catamaran versus the deep V but a lot of
things<00:05:07.530> are<00:05:07.800> similar<00:05:08.070> like<00:05:08.400> the<00:05:10.220> foam<00:05:11.220> gasket

00:05:12.140 --> 00:05:12.150 
things are similar like the foam gasket

00:05:12.150 --> 00:05:14.540 
things are similar like the foam gasket
around<00:05:12.240> the<00:05:12.480> hatch<00:05:12.800> but<00:05:13.800> one<00:05:13.980> feature<00:05:14.220> that<00:05:14.490> I

00:05:14.540 --> 00:05:14.550 
around the hatch but one feature that I

00:05:14.550 --> 00:05:16.790 
around the hatch but one feature that I
do<00:05:14.670> like<00:05:14.970> about<00:05:15.240> this<00:05:15.480> one<00:05:15.810> as<00:05:16.110> opposed<00:05:16.530> to<00:05:16.650> the

00:05:16.790 --> 00:05:16.800 
do like about this one as opposed to the

00:05:16.800 --> 00:05:21.830 
do like about this one as opposed to the
sterics<00:05:17.310> is<00:05:17.630> that<00:05:18.630> it<00:05:18.930> has<00:05:19.110> a<00:05:20.660> little<00:05:21.660> thumb

00:05:21.830 --> 00:05:21.840 
sterics is that it has a little thumb

00:05:21.840 --> 00:05:24.170 
sterics is that it has a little thumb
screw<00:05:22.140> that<00:05:22.290> you<00:05:22.350> can<00:05:22.590> use<00:05:22.770> to<00:05:23.040> to<00:05:23.880> seal<00:05:24.060> the

00:05:24.170 --> 00:05:24.180 
screw that you can use to to seal the

00:05:24.180 --> 00:05:26.180 
screw that you can use to to seal the
hatch<00:05:24.330> instead<00:05:24.720> of<00:05:24.840> one<00:05:25.020> of<00:05:25.110> those<00:05:25.230> little

00:05:26.180 --> 00:05:26.190 
hatch instead of one of those little

00:05:26.190 --> 00:05:31.190 
hatch instead of one of those little
tabs<00:05:26.940> that<00:05:27.360> you<00:05:28.140> would<00:05:28.350> depress<00:05:29.930> to<00:05:30.930> get<00:05:31.080> it

00:05:31.190 --> 00:05:31.200 
tabs that you would depress to get it

00:05:31.200 --> 00:05:33.380 
tabs that you would depress to get it
sealed<00:05:31.500> so<00:05:32.340> now<00:05:32.400> it's<00:05:32.610> nice<00:05:32.790> and<00:05:32.820> secure

00:05:33.380 --> 00:05:33.390

00:06:03.680 --> 00:06:03.690 
that's a quick look at the boat very

00:06:03.690 --> 00:06:04.460

a<00:06:04.530> little<00:06:05.070> nine-inch<00:06:05.660> catamaran<00:06:06.660> very

00:06:07.400 --> 00:06:07.410 
a little nine-inch catamaran very

00:06:07.410 --> 00:06:10.160 
a little nine-inch catamaran very
detailed<00:06:08.090> which<00:06:09.090> to<00:06:09.330> its<00:06:09.510> full-size

00:06:10.160 --> 00:06:10.170 
detailed which to its full-size

00:06:10.170 --> 00:06:12.980 
detailed which to its full-size
counterpart<00:06:11.100> in<00:06:11.250> the<00:06:11.340> Hobby<00:06:11.520> I<00:06:11.670> mean<00:06:11.910> 36<00:06:12.810> inch

00:06:12.980 --> 00:06:12.990 
counterpart in the Hobby I mean 36 inch

00:06:12.990 --> 00:06:15.590 
counterpart in the Hobby I mean 36 inch
or<00:06:13.220> 29<00:06:14.220> both<00:06:14.610> I<00:06:14.850> think<00:06:14.880> there's<00:06:15.150> both<00:06:15.270> of<00:06:15.480> them

or 29 both I think there's both of them

00:06:15.600 --> 00:06:19.130 
or 29 both I think there's both of them
but<00:06:15.980> again<00:06:16.980> it's<00:06:17.310> very<00:06:17.370> similar<00:06:17.880> in<00:06:18.630> styling
