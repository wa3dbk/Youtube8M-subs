right through shock charges and it blows

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:43.340 
right through shock charges and it blows
up<00:01:41.460> on<00:01:41.579> you<00:01:41.700> and<00:01:41.850> it<00:01:42.060> doesn't<00:01:42.509> shock<00:01:42.810> you<00:01:42.869> or

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:44.970 
anything and I really like that because

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:47.090 
anything and I really like that because
I<00:01:45.090> usually<00:01:45.540> run<00:01:45.840> into<00:01:46.049> them<00:01:46.290> a<00:01:46.320> lot<00:01:46.560> and<00:01:47.009> my

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:47.100 
I usually run into them a lot and my

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:49.010 
I usually run into them a lot and my
score<00:01:47.340> streaks<00:01:47.610> are<00:01:47.759> the<00:01:47.909> UAV<00:01:48.299> it's<00:01:48.479> 350

00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:49.020 
score streaks are the UAV it's 350

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:50.719 
score streaks are the UAV it's 350
points<00:01:49.350> it<00:01:49.680> shows<00:01:49.920> the<00:01:50.070> enemies<00:01:50.340> on<00:01:50.520> the

00:01:50.719 --> 00:01:50.729 
points it shows the enemies on the

00:01:50.729 --> 00:01:52.940 
points it shows the enemies on the
mini-map<00:01:50.970> everyone<00:01:51.540> uses<00:01:51.869> this<00:01:52.049> it<00:01:52.259> so<00:01:52.439> P<00:01:52.710> if

00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:52.950 
mini-map everyone uses this it so P if

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:54.440 
mini-map everyone uses this it so P if
you<00:01:53.070> have<00:01:53.159> a<00:01:53.189> UAV<00:01:53.369> up<00:01:53.729> in<00:01:53.820> the<00:01:53.909> sky<00:01:54.119> which<00:01:54.360> you

00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:54.450 
you have a UAV up in the sky which you

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:56.780 
you have a UAV up in the sky which you
probably<00:01:54.600> will<00:01:54.899> because<00:01:55.140> everyone<00:01:55.680> does<00:01:55.890> it

00:01:56.780 --> 00:01:56.790 
probably will because everyone does it

00:01:56.790 --> 00:01:58.100 
probably will because everyone does it
let<00:01:56.969> you<00:01:57.000> know<00:01:57.210> where<00:01:57.360> all<00:01:57.390> the<00:01:57.630> enemies<00:01:57.930> are

00:01:58.100 --> 00:01:58.110 
let you know where all the enemies are

00:01:58.110 --> 00:01:59.749 
let you know where all the enemies are
it<00:01:58.350> just<00:01:58.500> helps<00:01:58.710> you<00:01:58.799> win<00:01:58.950> gunfights<00:01:59.189> by

00:01:59.749 --> 00:01:59.759 
it just helps you win gunfights by

00:01:59.759 --> 00:02:02.240 
it just helps you win gunfights by
knowing<00:02:00.119> where<00:02:00.299> the<00:02:00.420> enemy<00:02:00.899> is<00:02:01.100> people<00:02:02.100> can

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:02.250 
knowing where the enemy is people can

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:03.920 
knowing where the enemy is people can
use<00:02:02.430> go<00:02:02.610> to<00:02:02.670> not<00:02:03.119> show<00:02:03.299> up<00:02:03.420> on<00:02:03.540> it<00:02:03.630> but<00:02:03.750> ghost

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:03.930 
use go to not show up on it but ghost

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:05.929 
use go to not show up on it but ghost
isn't<00:02:04.170> that<00:02:04.469> great<00:02:04.710> it<00:02:05.460> only<00:02:05.579> works<00:02:05.790> when

00:02:05.929 --> 00:02:05.939 
isn't that great it only works when

00:02:05.939 --> 00:02:07.700 
isn't that great it only works when
they're<00:02:06.119> moving<00:02:06.450> which<00:02:06.810> I<00:02:06.930> did<00:02:07.079> do<00:02:07.439> a<00:02:07.469> tip

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:07.710 
they're moving which I did do a tip

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:09.650 
they're moving which I did do a tip
video<00:02:07.950> so<00:02:08.129> you<00:02:08.190> can<00:02:08.429> use<00:02:08.610> you<00:02:08.910> know<00:02:09.000> make<00:02:09.330> ghost

00:02:09.650 --> 00:02:09.660 
video so you can use you know make ghost

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:11.780 
video so you can use you know make ghost
work<00:02:09.869> better<00:02:10.140> but<00:02:10.500> for<00:02:10.920> the<00:02:11.370> most<00:02:11.489> part<00:02:11.700> it's

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:11.790 
work better but for the most part it's

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:13.370 
work better but for the most part it's
still<00:02:11.970> not<00:02:12.090> that<00:02:12.270> great<00:02:12.420> if<00:02:12.690> at<00:02:12.840> any<00:02:13.050> point

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:13.380 
still not that great if at any point

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:14.750 
still not that great if at any point
time<00:02:13.560> they<00:02:13.710> stop<00:02:13.980> they<00:02:14.220> will<00:02:14.400> show<00:02:14.520> up<00:02:14.580> on<00:02:14.700> the

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:14.760 
time they stop they will show up on the

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:18.830 
time they stop they will show up on the
radar<00:02:15.030> and<00:02:15.770> also<00:02:16.770> uh<00:02:16.940> it's<00:02:17.940> just<00:02:18.300> you<00:02:18.600> know<00:02:18.690> it

00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:18.840

lets you know everything and there is

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:22.880 
lets you know everything and there is
one<00:02:20.880> class<00:02:21.090> that<00:02:21.120> goes<00:02:21.660> which<00:02:22.410> is<00:02:22.620> the<00:02:22.740> default

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:22.890 
one class that goes which is the default

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:24.560 
one class that goes which is the default
class<00:02:23.190> but<00:02:23.430> no<00:02:23.520> one<00:02:23.640> really<00:02:23.910> uses<00:02:24.030> it<00:02:24.420> unless

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:24.570 
class but no one really uses it unless

00:02:24.570 --> 00:02:25.970 
class but no one really uses it unless
they're<00:02:24.750> level<00:02:25.050> like<00:02:25.170> one<00:02:25.350> or<00:02:25.500> whatever<00:02:25.770> and

00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:28.940 
they're level like one or whatever and
also<00:02:26.640> ghost<00:02:26.910> is<00:02:27.090> an<00:02:27.270> unlock<00:02:27.630> 255<00:02:28.200> so<00:02:28.500> right<00:02:28.800> now

everyone uses them and not that many
people<00:02:33.270> shoot<00:02:33.600> them<00:02:33.690> down<00:02:33.840> and<00:02:34.260> you<00:02:34.440> can<00:02:34.620> just

00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:34.800 
people shoot them down and you can just

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:36.950

see the enemy on the map forever so my
advice<00:02:37.230> to<00:02:37.260> you<00:02:37.500> is<00:02:37.740> take<00:02:38.220> air<00:02:38.460> support<00:02:38.820> and

00:02:38.870 --> 00:02:38.880 
advice to you is take air support and

00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:40.520 
advice to you is take air support and
shoot<00:02:39.060> it<00:02:39.180> down<00:02:39.300> but<00:02:39.960> you're<00:02:40.050> gonna<00:02:40.170> waste<00:02:40.380> a

00:05:17.650 --> 00:05:18.899 
but in Call of Duty it's all together so
it's<00:05:17.830> like<00:05:18.009> there's<00:05:18.220> only<00:05:18.250> four<00:05:18.669> bars

00:05:22.080 --> 00:05:22.090 
obviously four bars so you know one bar

00:05:25.810 --> 00:05:27.120 
and I don't know the actual things but
there's<00:05:26.020> probably<00:05:26.139> a<00:05:26.349> lot<00:05:26.500> there's<00:05:26.889> a<00:05:26.979> big

00:05:27.120 --> 00:05:27.130 
there's probably a lot there's a big

00:05:35.850 --> 00:05:35.860 
100 and someone's on a 90 100 is gonna

00:05:35.860 --> 00:05:37.680 
100 and someone's on a 90 100 is gonna
be<00:05:36.009> you<00:05:36.849> know<00:05:36.880> have<00:05:37.150> a<00:05:37.180> better<00:05:37.330> connection

00:05:37.680 --> 00:05:37.690 
be you know have a better connection

00:05:37.690 --> 00:05:39.959 
be you know have a better connection
than<00:05:38.080> the<00:05:38.229> 90<00:05:38.560> by<00:05:38.770> a<00:05:38.800> lot<00:05:39.250> even<00:05:39.699> though<00:05:39.820> it's

00:05:39.959 --> 00:05:39.969 
than the 90 by a lot even though it's

00:05:39.969 --> 00:05:42.719 
than the 90 by a lot even though it's
just<00:05:40.120> a<00:05:40.300> few<00:05:40.539> numbers<00:05:40.719> and<00:05:41.110> so<00:05:41.919> that<00:05:42.250> in<00:05:42.550> this

00:05:42.719 --> 00:05:42.729 
just a few numbers and so that in this

00:05:42.729 --> 00:05:44.939 
just a few numbers and so that in this
game<00:05:42.940> no<00:05:43.389> four<00:05:43.659> bar<00:05:43.840> is<00:05:44.050> the<00:05:44.229> same<00:05:44.469> I<00:05:44.710> guess

00:05:44.939 --> 00:05:44.949 
game no four bar is the same I guess

00:05:44.949 --> 00:05:46.890 
game no four bar is the same I guess
just<00:05:45.789> because<00:05:45.940> you<00:05:46.150> have<00:05:46.240> a<00:05:46.300> four<00:05:46.539> bar<00:05:46.690> you

00:05:46.890 --> 00:05:46.900 
just because you have a four bar you

00:05:46.900 --> 00:05:48.540 
just because you have a four bar you
still<00:05:47.169> might<00:05:47.320> be<00:05:47.349> lagging<00:05:47.710> compared<00:05:48.310> to<00:05:48.430> the

00:05:48.540 --> 00:05:48.550 
still might be lagging compared to the

00:05:48.550 --> 00:05:50.310 
still might be lagging compared to the
four<00:05:48.759> bar<00:05:48.940> person<00:05:49.360> that<00:05:49.539> you're<00:05:49.690> fighting<00:05:50.080> or

00:05:50.310 --> 00:05:50.320 
four bar person that you're fighting or

00:05:50.320 --> 00:05:52.320 
four bar person that you're fighting or
going<00:05:51.009> up<00:05:51.099> against<00:05:51.400> I<00:05:51.460> guess<00:05:51.610> shooting<00:05:51.940> it<00:05:52.090> and

00:05:52.320 --> 00:05:52.330 
going up against I guess shooting it and

00:05:52.330 --> 00:05:55.170 
going up against I guess shooting it and

shoot faster after sprinting and the

00:06:02.979 --> 00:06:04.589 
shoot faster after sprinting and the

00:06:08.700 --> 00:06:08.710 
fire and I usually get the kill unless I

00:06:08.710 --> 00:06:09.870

have one if you don't choose a secondary

00:06:15.789 --> 00:06:18.149 
have one if you don't choose a secondary
you<00:06:15.969> do<00:06:16.120> have<00:06:16.300> a<00:06:16.330> combat<00:06:16.780> knife<00:06:16.930> I<00:06:17.199> usually

you do have a combat knife I usually

00:06:18.159 --> 00:06:20.610 
you do have a combat knife I usually
choose<00:06:18.310> air<00:06:18.610> support<00:06:19.080> but<00:06:20.080> you<00:06:20.169> know<00:06:20.289> it's<00:06:20.500> the

00:06:20.610 --> 00:06:20.620 
choose air support but you know it's the

00:06:20.620 --> 00:06:22.320 
choose air support but you know it's the
whole<00:06:20.740> big<00:06:20.919> 10<00:06:21.159> system<00:06:21.370> and<00:06:21.759> when<00:06:22.210> you're

00:06:22.320 --> 00:06:22.330 
whole big 10 system and when you're

00:06:22.330 --> 00:06:24.930 
whole big 10 system and when you're
using<00:06:22.570> a<00:06:22.780> a<00:06:23.259> wild<00:06:23.949> card<00:06:24.310> you<00:06:24.520> you<00:06:24.699> know<00:06:24.820> you

00:06:24.930 --> 00:06:24.940 
using a a wild card you you know you

00:06:24.940 --> 00:06:26.100 
using a a wild card you you know you
have<00:06:25.029> to<00:06:25.150> sacrifice<00:06:25.360> something

00:06:26.100 --> 00:06:26.110 
have to sacrifice something

00:06:26.110 --> 00:06:28.260 
have to sacrifice something
so<00:06:26.620> I<00:06:26.650> usually<00:06:26.889> sacrifice<00:06:27.550> and<00:06:27.729> I<00:06:27.760> secondary

00:06:28.260 --> 00:06:28.270 
so I usually sacrifice and I secondary

00:06:28.270 --> 00:06:29.119 
so I usually sacrifice and I secondary
to<00:06:28.479> have<00:06:28.659> a

00:06:29.119 --> 00:06:29.129 
to have a

00:06:29.129 --> 00:06:31.820 
to have a
second<00:06:29.459> perk<00:06:29.639> of<00:06:29.879> some<00:06:30.059> sorts<00:06:30.679> usually<00:06:31.679> gets

00:06:31.820 --> 00:06:31.830 
second perk of some sorts usually gets

00:06:31.830 --> 00:06:33.229 
second perk of some sorts usually gets
me<00:06:31.949> killed<00:06:32.069> because<00:06:32.279> I'm<00:06:32.459> out<00:06:32.669> of<00:06:32.729> ammo

00:06:33.229 --> 00:06:33.239 
me killed because I'm out of ammo

00:06:33.239 --> 00:06:35.179 
me killed because I'm out of ammo
I<00:06:33.270> would<00:06:33.959> advise<00:06:34.259> if<00:06:34.499> you<00:06:34.619> don't<00:06:34.889> have<00:06:35.159> a

00:06:35.179 --> 00:06:35.189 
I would advise if you don't have a

00:06:35.189 --> 00:06:38.269 
I would advise if you don't have a
secondary<00:06:35.669> run<00:06:36.569> either<00:06:36.779> scavenger<00:06:37.589> or<00:06:37.830> dual

00:06:38.269 --> 00:06:38.279 
secondary run either scavenger or dual

00:06:38.279 --> 00:06:41.179 
secondary run either scavenger or dual
mag<00:06:38.809> because<00:06:39.809> if<00:06:40.379> you<00:06:40.589> switch<00:06:40.889> to<00:06:41.009> that

00:06:41.179 --> 00:06:41.189 
mag because if you switch to that

00:06:41.189 --> 00:06:42.889 
mag because if you switch to that
secondary<00:06:41.580> it's<00:06:41.819> like<00:06:41.999> the<00:06:42.149> worst<00:06:42.389> feeling<00:06:42.599> in

00:06:42.889 --> 00:06:42.899 
secondary it's like the worst feeling in

00:06:42.899 --> 00:06:44.540 
secondary it's like the worst feeling in
the<00:06:42.989> world<00:06:43.019> when<00:06:43.379> you<00:06:43.529> realize<00:06:43.949> you<00:06:44.429> don't

00:06:44.540 --> 00:06:44.550 
the world when you realize you don't

00:06:44.550 --> 00:06:48.079 
the world when you realize you don't
have<00:06:44.699> one<00:06:45.059> and<00:06:45.589> I<00:06:46.589> come<00:06:47.249> back<00:06:47.429> night<00:06:47.639> pops<00:06:47.879> out
