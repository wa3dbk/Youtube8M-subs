00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:06.210
 we want to share with you how we salt 

00:00:03.780 --> 00:00:08.069
 There are many ways to fish a ram 

00:00:06.210 --> 00:00:10.849
 we tried several therefore 

00:00:08.069 --> 00:00:15.179
 stopped on this one the easiest 

00:00:10.849 --> 00:00:17.400
 like from the rocks without any frills or 

00:00:15.179 --> 00:00:19.710
 how to call it and so on means for 

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:21.869
 the fact that the fish comes across I immediately 

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:25.320
 fasten that the fish was weakened yesterday we 

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:30.570
 took covered salt this pike here at 

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:33.239
 us rudd roach I understand it 

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:36.600
 how sorry podleschik under and podleschik 

00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:38.340
 so yesterday we just showered the gills 

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:39.480
 lest she begin to spoil her 

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:41.579
 freeze it 

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:43.370
 salt today is just very late yesterday 

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:48.360
 arrived so there was no up to engage 

00:00:43.370 --> 00:00:50.730
 so i'm cleaning my guts with guts 

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:52.860
 dry it bitter I do not know how anyone 

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:54.449
 it turns out we did not work out it is bitter and 

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:57.030
 we like it so we are guts 

00:00:54.449 --> 00:00:57.890
 we clean and start to salt our take 

00:00:57.030 --> 00:01:00.449
 regular salt 

00:00:57.890 --> 00:01:02.910
 stone necessarily if you take 

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:05.610
 this fine salt will be nothing 

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:08.540
 because finely the salt becomes 

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:10.790
 crust on fish and then no sense 

00:01:08.540 --> 00:01:14.430
 we pour a little bit to the bottom 

00:01:10.790 --> 00:01:16.200
 literally a little and well fall asleep 

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:18.450
 above all in for the gills of me yesterday 

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:22.490
 a little sprinkled still today it dos 

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:26.670
 good because the gills are the cornerstone 

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:27.659
 where does all the gills start to rot 

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:31.549
 here is this bitch 

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:36.210
 my husband loves pike i will fall asleep 

00:01:31.549 --> 00:01:38.130
 pour inside say how much 

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:41.460
 you did not add salt to the fish 

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:44.310
 will take me really checked the more 

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:47.250
 salt who do you get rub and how am i 

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:49.140
 I call therefore the salt I pour not very 

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:50.720
 a lot but not very little can not say 

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:53.610
 how much per kilogram of fish 

00:01:50.720 --> 00:01:57.060
 look how much i sprinkle on 

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:59.570
 I donâ€™t tax dominoes for fish 

00:01:57.060 --> 00:02:05.149
 raglana eye set 

00:01:59.570 --> 00:02:07.530
 falling asleep falling asleep how everything and 

00:02:05.149 --> 00:02:17.580
 we stack so sudochek a little young and 

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:19.110
 took well like this means 

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:21.930
 look i have a trick because 

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:25.050
 that the fish is different i'm starting to lay out with 

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:27.830
 beginning big fish on the bottom and then on 

00:02:25.050 --> 00:02:30.480
 top lay the smallest 

00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:32.280
 why so because small fish 

00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:35.220
 it takes less time so salty 

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:38.400
 pulling out and and especially if there are a lot of fish 

00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:43.400
 earlier then it does not overburden with 

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:46.980
 excess time does not lie in brine 

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:50.670
 so sprinkled the middle home sprinkle 

00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:56.300
 not forget because there if not 

00:02:50.670 --> 00:02:59.190
 sprinkle something wrong and lay down 

00:02:56.300 --> 00:03:04.890
 then next in size and so on 

00:02:59.190 --> 00:03:06.480
 the end here we have the last fish here 

00:03:04.890 --> 00:03:08.550
 this size of mu fish I already in April 

00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:10.349
 gills are not a chain but all a bunch of din din 

00:03:08.550 --> 00:03:13.080
 when the fish is even less called it 

00:03:10.349 --> 00:03:17.629
 seeds then i'm even in the middle of or 

00:03:13.080 --> 00:03:17.629
 just poured means fish we laid 

00:03:20.330 --> 00:03:30.360
 then we do it so immediately dock 

00:03:27.269 --> 00:03:32.099
 food husband cut such a plate under 

00:03:30.360 --> 00:03:34.760
 ships and take on 

00:03:32.099 --> 00:03:34.760
 I will not lift 

00:03:38.370 --> 00:03:44.140
 forest so as not to burst it can be the opposite of this 

00:03:41.650 --> 00:03:46.470
 parties ambassador please that he loves himself 

00:03:44.140 --> 00:03:49.510
 in Tomsk that everything is so easy not to burst 

00:03:46.470 --> 00:03:52.720
 we found a granite stone we have them here 

00:03:49.510 --> 00:04:01.120
 you can not need much 

00:03:52.720 --> 00:04:02.799
 some load and so it all means 

00:04:01.120 --> 00:04:05.140
 very important rules first fish 

00:04:02.799 --> 00:04:06.819
 kept all the time while she salted in 

00:04:05.140 --> 00:04:09.430
 the fridge cold place died 

00:04:06.819 --> 00:04:11.739
 the fridge is second pickle which 

00:04:09.430 --> 00:04:13.239
 formed that sounds it is also called here 

00:04:11.739 --> 00:04:16.750
 there will be a pickle need to be formed 

00:04:13.239 --> 00:04:20.320
 every day merge into a third big 

00:04:16.750 --> 00:04:22.240
 fish salted 5 days and higher whichever 

00:04:20.320 --> 00:04:25.780
 largest this pike we will 

00:04:22.240 --> 00:04:28.810
 somewhere salt for 45 days then I will 

00:04:25.780 --> 00:04:30.430
 just look at it so higher 

00:04:28.810 --> 00:04:32.710
 she will salt for three days if at all 

00:04:30.430 --> 00:04:35.440
 narrowly she salted a day or two that is 

00:04:32.710 --> 00:04:37.570
 enough we put it all now in 

00:04:35.440 --> 00:04:40.300
 fridge without a draw 

00:04:37.570 --> 00:04:41.979
 so that she does not suffocate means for what 

00:04:40.300 --> 00:04:44.080
 began to merge that sound this one 

00:04:41.979 --> 00:04:46.060
 sprout for it not to start there 

00:04:44.080 --> 00:04:47.919
 what microorganisms of joy are different 

00:04:46.060 --> 00:04:50.050
 it must be drained once a day 

00:04:47.919 --> 00:04:51.310
 This is the minimum if the first is formed 

00:04:50.050 --> 00:04:54.430
 time is very much at once 

00:04:51.310 --> 00:04:58.930
 then merge two times and here and then we 

00:04:54.430 --> 00:05:02.199
 show when we hang here and gianna 

00:04:58.930 --> 00:05:05.620
 us will be dried and what conditions then 

00:05:02.199 --> 00:05:06.330
 the frame is ready the fish are clogged we and 

00:05:05.620 --> 00:05:10.449
 salted 

00:05:06.330 --> 00:05:13.300
 all at the same time because now it is very 

00:05:10.449 --> 00:05:15.580
 troublesome for us 

00:05:13.300 --> 00:05:17.650
 first days hang two three bitches then 

00:05:15.580 --> 00:05:18.909
 let us think of the second but generally 

00:05:17.650 --> 00:05:21.039
 this small is pulled out 

00:05:18.909 --> 00:05:25.000
 Earlier the larger it means it is filled 

00:05:21.039 --> 00:05:25.800
 three days three days with us now we will 

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:28.210
 flush 

00:05:25.800 --> 00:05:30.970
 This is a very, very important point for her 

00:05:28.210 --> 00:05:33.880
 not too salty too is 

00:05:30.970 --> 00:05:37.060
 marks in salt and it should get wet and 

00:05:33.880 --> 00:05:38.860
 general rules for taranki get wet 

00:05:37.060 --> 00:05:41.139
 wash out the water as much as 

00:05:38.860 --> 00:05:44.190
 dried off ie out of 3 days before 

00:05:41.139 --> 00:05:46.660
 start and rather dried i confuse 

00:05:44.190 --> 00:05:48.009
 burst out start from the forest lasted three days 

00:05:46.660 --> 00:05:51.669
 getting wet in the water 

00:05:48.009 --> 00:05:53.349
 screams soaked three hours right now 

00:05:51.669 --> 00:05:55.030
 we fill it with water she will 

00:05:53.349 --> 00:05:57.520
 macerate for three hours in water and only 

00:05:55.030 --> 00:06:00.090
 then we go and toffee now we 

00:05:57.520 --> 00:06:07.870
 hang fish 

00:06:00.090 --> 00:06:11.430
 here and so that's definitely on the hooks 

00:06:07.870 --> 00:06:11.430
 open her tummy 

00:06:14.520 --> 00:06:26.440
 we have a tummy 

00:06:17.500 --> 00:06:30.159
 podsypal sure to show you how 

00:06:26.440 --> 00:06:38.530
 this thing is done when the fish is dry 

00:06:30.159 --> 00:06:45.550
 and between our fish dryer so she 

00:06:38.530 --> 00:06:50.889
 hangs there and here in the attic she is behind 

00:06:45.550 --> 00:06:54.039
 three or four days may be dependent 

00:06:50.889 --> 00:06:58.889
 the weather is sunny then faster not 

00:06:54.039 --> 00:06:58.889
 it's sunny here longer but she is Kazan here
