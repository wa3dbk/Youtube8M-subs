00:00:00.370 --> 00:00:03.680
 and quickly the view of the dressage riders also had theirs today 

00:00:03.679 --> 00:00:08.140
 Nations Cup when something handicapped Wallstadt four riders could only get three 

00:00:08.140 --> 00:00:12.010
 compete or injured by Anabel Balkenhol all the more then on 

00:00:12.009 --> 00:00:14.559
 Totilas and Matthias Alexander Rath 

00:00:14.559 --> 00:00:17.099
 to Andrea Schulte with the most important for her 

00:00:17.099 --> 00:00:23.169
 a forum to get back from Matthias Rath and Wonder Horse Totilas all have 

00:00:23.169 --> 00:00:24.770
 Expectations exceeded 

00:00:24.770 --> 00:00:27.519
 also your own 

00:00:27.519 --> 00:00:30.020
 Â«Reconciliation about the associated understand 

00:00:30.020 --> 00:00:33.110
 Evesen right after that is never that fascinating as this one goes along 

00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:36.410
 fight to meet many really wanted to give everything 

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:39.940
 the guys with co-ordinated throws have four guests again but different 

00:00:39.940 --> 00:00:42.770
 reacted incredibly great "would have fought me with it 

00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:45.450
 and it was just a unique feeling 

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:48.909
 the 26-year-old works council and his black stallion 

00:00:48.909 --> 00:00:51.710
 have pulled the crowds into the stadium 

00:00:51.710 --> 00:00:55.640
 Finding the best view has made the security guys work up a sweat 

00:00:55.640 --> 00:01:00.490
 been just before Matthias Gottwald with 11 4 11 the Delphi for year on 

00:01:00.490 --> 00:01:01.910
 tightened 

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:04.600
 Class performance for him, Mars has 

00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:07.600
 that Antje has 

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:12.049
 but we have also agreed that we do not tell us grades 

00:01:12.049 --> 00:01:14.060
 we knew you were a driver 

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:18.640
 your Favorites percent of the population of the personal misery justifiable 

00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:19.570
 held 

00:01:19.570 --> 00:01:22.570
 The daddy said they did not want any radios 

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:26.180
 I should not really pompous I should also be a little between 

00:01:26.180 --> 00:01:29.570
 and how can you no longer see them coping with the government so far 

00:01:29.570 --> 00:01:30.750
 it was further 

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:33.750
 with a 10 percent constantly interrupted 

00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:37.040
 the other two years ago 

00:01:37.040 --> 00:01:40.450
 this claim to yourself is cool and focused around 

00:01:40.450 --> 00:01:41.730
 now the affair will be 

00:01:41.730 --> 00:01:44.110
 Wildungen 

00:01:44.110 --> 00:01:47.740
 Stepmom Ann Kathrin Linsenhoff and friend Franziska 

00:01:47.740 --> 00:01:51.040
 then also after that no exams full of highlights 

00:01:51.040 --> 00:01:54.040
 here for example the two-bet in a gallop 

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:02.610
 the pirouettes 

00:02:07.030 --> 00:02:08.349
 fell for April 

00:02:08.349 --> 00:02:11.790
 Wilfried Verschluss I hold a small smile on the lips of the 

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:12.989
 Reiter 

00:02:12.989 --> 00:02:17.010
 yes no then percent of the houses was left out but did not stay as well 

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:18.970
 always that is a very very good habitable 

00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:22.020
 the last one with less sugar, too weirdly beautiful in everything a beautiful one 

00:02:22.020 --> 00:02:24.799
 Church is called that was again 

00:02:24.799 --> 00:02:27.739
 Whoever has to, that's why some of them have become one 

00:02:27.739 --> 00:02:29.549
 avoid that he has failed 

00:02:29.549 --> 00:02:32.749
 and that was already a day there was not so much traffic then off 

00:02:35.489 --> 00:02:38.489
 most industrious at sea 

00:02:38.489 --> 00:02:39.709
 every foul 

00:02:39.709 --> 00:02:42.709
 because every student with their parents get through the live 

00:02:43.959 --> 00:02:45.199
 Philipp Herrmann 

00:02:45.199 --> 00:02:48.339
 a game contained pieces 

00:02:48.339 --> 00:02:52.579
 corrected the result of the talks by a tiny amount downwards 

00:02:52.579 --> 00:02:54.329
 but think a little bit 

00:02:54.329 --> 00:02:58.439
 by Raphael Fiore 15 4 5 and 5 in the network does not exist 

00:03:01.649 --> 00:03:04.799
 by Detlef differently in the joy of tumbling and 

00:03:04.799 --> 00:03:07.799
 Friedhelm Funkel 

00:03:11.279 --> 00:03:14.280
 Should not owner Ann Kathrin Linsenhoff 

00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:17.280
 congratulates her stepson on his outstanding achievements 

00:03:18.619 --> 00:03:22.839
 and Matthias Brandt not happy the success 

00:03:26.279 --> 00:03:27.449
 and at it will 

00:03:27.449 --> 00:03:32.010
 of it had gone into trading the earned reward of this great sport 

00:03:34.169 --> 00:03:37.169
 while the two are on half life 

00:03:37.699 --> 00:03:40.929
 and Totti's family gets bored 

00:03:40.929 --> 00:03:44.689
 the owners Paul SchockemÃ¶hle and ann-kathrin Linsenhoff we speak with 

00:03:44.689 --> 00:03:47.889
 what he means coach klaus-martin Rath drives 

00:03:48.849 --> 00:03:53.349
 Matthias Rath and Totilas get out and the other three are back 

00:03:53.349 --> 00:03:56.349
 The two must be ready for peace 

00:03:56.899 --> 00:04:00.029
 No, I have to cry I have to say I stand 

00:04:00.029 --> 00:04:01.819
 a smile or a laugh 

00:04:01.819 --> 00:04:04.819
 Relief who is overeating is, I think, fitting 

00:04:06.089 --> 00:04:08.209
 a great idea approx 

00:04:08.209 --> 00:04:11.979
 Matthias has already set her very well on the weather it is with night 

00:04:11.979 --> 00:04:16.309
 they understand each other and lost everything timing the training 

00:04:16.309 --> 00:04:19.129
 Year focused task courageous 

00:04:19.129 --> 00:04:23.419
 be considered "courageous" as possible also in between percent will always be 

00:04:23.419 --> 00:04:27.650
 since the demanded what that leads then can synonymous on it can represent 

00:04:27.649 --> 00:04:30.740
 and I think that's why I think the grades are okay too 

00:04:30.740 --> 00:04:34.590
 but that it could be so good, because they have me in their own 

00:04:34.590 --> 00:04:37.710
 daring dreams do not count 

00:04:37.710 --> 00:04:39.990
 I know I was hoping for it 

00:04:39.990 --> 00:04:43.569
 he developed the Internet that changed everything to unusual 

00:04:43.569 --> 00:04:46.569
 and everything worked out well, I'm with myself 

00:04:46.569 --> 00:04:48.240
 f 

00:04:48.240 --> 00:04:52.250
 and together with Christoph Koschel and this world there was value as well 

00:04:52.250 --> 00:04:54.849
 Coronation the title in the team competition 

00:04:54.849 --> 00:04:57.849
 the Nations Cup 

00:04:58.590 --> 00:05:01.620
 and there is because he is the beginning 

00:05:01.620 --> 00:05:04.620
 the next two dressage tests are still to come 

00:05:05.879 --> 00:05:07.249
 on Saturday 

00:05:07.249 --> 00:05:08.409
 and Sunday 

00:05:08.409 --> 00:05:09.619
 here the maker
