it<00:00:10.110> is<00:00:10.290> now<00:00:10.440> 26<00:00:11.250> days<00:00:11.580> since<00:00:12.240> the<00:00:12.570> previous

00:00:13.039 --> 00:00:13.049 
it is now 26 days since the previous

00:00:13.049 --> 00:00:18.109 
it is now 26 days since the previous
video<00:00:13.440> was<00:00:13.679> taken<00:00:13.860> showing<00:00:14.519> the<00:00:17.119> flowering

00:00:18.109 --> 00:00:18.119 
video was taken showing the flowering

00:00:18.119 --> 00:00:25.939 
video was taken showing the flowering
stage<00:00:20.900> we<00:00:21.900> can<00:00:22.050> now<00:00:22.170> see<00:00:22.560> I<00:00:24.320> would<00:00:25.320> match<00:00:25.560> the

00:00:25.939 --> 00:00:25.949 
stage we can now see I would match the

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:33.280 
stage we can now see I would match the
fruit<00:00:26.369> this<00:00:26.580> and<00:00:27.510> the<00:00:28.380> number<00:00:28.680> of<00:00:28.800> fruit<00:00:29.070> so

00:00:33.280 --> 00:00:33.290 

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:35.450 

over<00:00:34.290> here<00:00:34.469> we<00:00:34.590> can<00:00:34.739> see<00:00:34.980> that<00:00:35.130> the<00:00:35.280> rain

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:35.460 
over here we can see that the rain

00:00:35.460 --> 00:01:03.560 
over here we can see that the rain
shelter<00:00:36.000> has<00:00:36.300> now<00:00:36.510> been<00:00:36.780> deployed

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:03.570 

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:07.010 

if<00:01:03.930> we<00:01:04.080> just<00:01:04.320> grab<00:01:04.500> this<00:01:05.450> plus<00:01:06.450> for<00:01:06.660> a<00:01:06.720> freak

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:07.020 
if we just grab this plus for a freak

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:10.610 
if we just grab this plus for a freak
we'll<00:01:07.200> do<00:01:07.320> a<00:01:07.350> comparison<00:01:08.010> to<00:01:09.470> inside<00:01:10.470> the

00:01:10.610 --> 00:01:10.620 
we'll do a comparison to inside the

00:01:10.620 --> 00:01:17.800 
we'll do a comparison to inside the
retractable<00:01:11.280> roof<00:01:11.460> in<00:01:11.610> a<00:01:11.670> minute

00:01:17.800 --> 00:01:17.810 

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:21.610 

the<00:01:18.320> flowering<00:01:19.130> outside<00:01:20.110> was<00:01:21.110> somewhat

00:01:21.610 --> 00:01:21.620 
the flowering outside was somewhat

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:26.380 
the flowering outside was somewhat
erratic<00:01:22.300> but<00:01:23.300> in<00:01:23.720> general<00:01:24.760> the<00:01:25.760> flowering

00:01:26.380 --> 00:01:26.390 
erratic but in general the flowering

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:31.650 
erratic but in general the flowering
date<00:01:27.190> was<00:01:28.190> approximately<00:01:29.030> 15<00:01:29.600> days<00:01:29.900> delayed

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:31.660 
date was approximately 15 days delayed

00:01:31.660 --> 00:01:36.160 
date was approximately 15 days delayed
inside<00:01:32.890> sorry<00:01:33.950> outside<00:01:34.540> in<00:01:35.540> the<00:01:35.750> uncovered

00:01:36.160 --> 00:01:36.170 
inside sorry outside in the uncovered

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:41.680 
inside sorry outside in the uncovered
trees<00:01:36.619> in<00:01:37.840> comparison<00:01:38.840> to<00:01:39.250> that<00:01:40.250> and<00:01:40.820> the

00:01:41.680 --> 00:01:41.690 
trees in comparison to that and the

00:01:41.690 --> 00:02:29.750 
trees in comparison to that and the
retractable<00:01:42.650> roof

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:29.760 

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:33.000 

so<00:02:30.760> here<00:02:30.970> we<00:02:31.090> can<00:02:31.240> see<00:02:31.480> a<00:02:31.510> comparison<00:02:32.020> and<00:02:32.590> the

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:33.010 
so here we can see a comparison and the

00:02:33.010 --> 00:02:41.730 
so here we can see a comparison and the
leaves<00:02:33.250> outside<00:02:39.510> in<00:02:40.510> comparison<00:02:41.290> to<00:02:41.320> that<00:02:41.440> in

00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:41.740 
leaves outside in comparison to that in

00:02:41.740 --> 00:02:45.860 
leaves outside in comparison to that in
the<00:02:41.830> retractable<00:02:42.340> roof<00:02:43.500> you<00:02:44.500> can<00:02:44.560> see<00:02:44.920> that

00:02:45.860 --> 00:02:45.870 
the retractable roof you can see that

00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:49.190 
the retractable roof you can see that
the<00:02:46.870> stem<00:02:47.140> length<00:02:47.380> is<00:02:47.680> approximately<00:02:48.010> double

00:02:49.190 --> 00:02:49.200 
the stem length is approximately double

00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:58.500 
the stem length is approximately double
and<00:02:53.940> there<00:02:54.940> is<00:02:55.090> a<00:02:55.120> difference<00:02:55.660> in<00:02:57.210> how<00:02:58.210> clean

00:02:58.500 --> 00:02:58.510 
and there is a difference in how clean

00:02:58.510 --> 00:03:04.560 
and there is a difference in how clean
the<00:02:58.660> leaves<00:02:58.840> are<00:03:02.580> so<00:03:03.580> here's<00:03:03.880> the<00:03:04.090> fruit<00:03:04.360> from

00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:04.570 
the leaves are so here's the fruit from

00:03:04.570 --> 00:03:13.010 
the leaves are so here's the fruit from
outside<00:03:08.100> and<00:03:09.100> we<00:03:09.310> can<00:03:09.340> compare<00:03:10.000> that<00:03:10.030> to

00:03:13.010 --> 00:03:13.020 

00:03:13.020 --> 00:03:16.740 

what's<00:03:14.020> happening<00:03:14.850> inside<00:03:15.850> the<00:03:16.060> retractable

00:03:16.740 --> 00:03:16.750 
what's happening inside the retractable

00:03:16.750 --> 00:03:25.309 
what's happening inside the retractable
roof

00:03:25.309 --> 00:03:25.319 

00:03:25.319 --> 00:03:29.270 

there<00:03:25.830> is<00:03:25.980> definitely<00:03:26.220> a<00:03:27.560> heavier<00:03:28.560> fruit<00:03:28.920> set

00:03:29.270 --> 00:03:29.280 
there is definitely a heavier fruit set

00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:47.670 
there is definitely a heavier fruit set
inside

00:03:47.670 --> 00:03:47.680 

00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:51.670 

the<00:03:48.680> eating<00:03:49.640> the<00:03:50.269> the<00:03:50.299> tanks<00:03:51.140> here<00:03:51.319> that<00:03:51.560> you

00:03:51.670 --> 00:03:51.680 
the eating the the tanks here that you

00:03:51.680 --> 00:03:56.470 
the eating the the tanks here that you
see<00:03:52.540> were<00:03:53.540> for<00:03:53.930> heaters<00:03:54.349> that<00:03:54.379> were<00:03:54.830> used<00:03:55.480> only

00:03:56.470 --> 00:03:56.480 
see were for heaters that were used only

00:03:56.480 --> 00:03:58.869 
see were for heaters that were used only
on<00:03:57.140> extreme<00:03:57.620> cold<00:03:57.950> nights<00:03:58.250> where<00:03:58.519> there<00:03:58.700> was

00:03:58.869 --> 00:03:58.879 
on extreme cold nights where there was

00:03:58.879 --> 00:04:01.509 
on extreme cold nights where there was
risk<00:03:59.120> of<00:03:59.390> damage<00:03:59.810> to<00:03:59.840> the<00:04:00.200> to<00:04:00.620> the<00:04:00.769> flowers<00:04:01.250> due

00:04:01.509 --> 00:04:01.519 
risk of damage to the to the flowers due

00:04:01.519 --> 00:04:04.360 
risk of damage to the to the flowers due
to<00:04:01.700> the<00:04:01.790> early<00:04:02.090> flowering<00:04:02.650> the<00:04:03.650> heaters<00:04:04.159> were

00:04:04.360 --> 00:04:04.370 
to the early flowering the heaters were

00:04:04.370 --> 00:04:07.569 
to the early flowering the heaters were
not<00:04:04.549> used<00:04:05.079> to<00:04:06.079> maintain<00:04:06.319> warmer<00:04:07.010> temperatures

00:04:07.569 --> 00:04:07.579 
not used to maintain warmer temperatures

00:04:07.579 --> 00:04:12.399 
not used to maintain warmer temperatures
to<00:04:08.150> advance<00:04:09.430> the<00:04:10.430> growth<00:04:10.670> only<00:04:11.030> to<00:04:11.780> protect

00:04:12.399 --> 00:04:12.409 
to advance the growth only to protect

00:04:12.409 --> 00:04:18.220 
to advance the growth only to protect
the<00:04:12.590> flowers<00:04:14.709> from<00:04:15.709> extreme<00:04:16.190> cold
