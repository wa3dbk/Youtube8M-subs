with<00:03:04.600> the<00:03:05.140> Samsung<00:03:05.620> Galaxy<00:03:05.650> s3<00:03:06.250> with<00:03:06.760> this

00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:06.910 
with the Samsung Galaxy s3 with this

00:03:06.910 --> 00:03:09.960 
with the Samsung Galaxy s3 with this
head<00:03:07.090> unit<00:03:07.420> and<00:03:07.650> found<00:03:08.650> that<00:03:09.040> pretty<00:03:09.520> much<00:03:09.670> no

00:03:09.960 --> 00:03:09.970 
head unit and found that pretty much no

00:03:09.970 --> 00:03:12.180

droids<00:03:10.300> are<00:03:10.690> compatible<00:03:11.320> with<00:03:11.620> audio

00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:12.190 
droids are compatible with audio

00:03:12.190 --> 00:03:15.140 
droids are compatible with audio
equipment<00:03:12.580> like<00:03:12.700> this<00:03:12.940> through<00:03:13.270> the<00:03:13.930> USB

00:03:15.140 --> 00:03:15.150 
equipment like this through the USB

00:03:15.150 --> 00:03:17.880 
equipment like this through the USB
androids<00:03:16.150> just<00:03:16.450> don't<00:03:16.690> stream<00:03:17.020> audio<00:03:17.410> through

00:03:17.880 --> 00:03:17.890 
androids just don't stream audio through

00:03:17.890 --> 00:03:20.880 
androids just don't stream audio through
the<00:03:18.010> USB<00:03:18.250> cable<00:03:18.610> so<00:03:19.060> that's<00:03:19.900> why<00:03:20.140> I<00:03:20.170> have<00:03:20.500> the

00:03:20.880 --> 00:03:20.890 
the USB cable so that's why I have the

00:03:20.890 --> 00:03:23.250 
the USB cable so that's why I have the
old-style<00:03:21.220> headphone<00:03:21.970> jack<00:03:22.300> that<00:03:22.630> you<00:03:22.990> can

00:03:23.250 --> 00:03:23.260 
old-style headphone jack that you can

00:03:23.260 --> 00:03:26.250 
old-style headphone jack that you can
plug<00:03:23.500> in<00:03:23.710> to<00:03:23.920> the<00:03:24.160> headphone<00:03:25.000> jack<00:03:25.030> but<00:03:25.570> the

00:03:26.250 --> 00:03:26.260 
plug in to the headphone jack but the

00:03:26.260 --> 00:03:28.050 
plug in to the headphone jack but the
problem<00:03:26.620> with<00:03:26.770> that<00:03:26.890> is<00:03:27.160> you<00:03:27.790> have<00:03:27.940> the

00:03:28.050 --> 00:03:28.060 
problem with that is you have the

00:03:28.060 --> 00:03:29.880 
problem with that is you have the
analogue<00:03:28.360> audio<00:03:28.600> so<00:03:29.110> it<00:03:29.230> doesn't<00:03:29.530> sound<00:03:29.710> as

00:03:29.880 --> 00:03:29.890 
analogue audio so it doesn't sound as

00:03:29.890 --> 00:03:32.430 
analogue audio so it doesn't sound as
good<00:03:29.980> and<00:03:30.370> you<00:03:30.880> have<00:03:31.060> no<00:03:31.240> control<00:03:31.420> so<00:03:32.380> you

00:03:32.430 --> 00:03:32.440 
good and you have no control so you

00:03:32.440 --> 00:03:34.260 
good and you have no control so you
can't<00:03:32.950> change<00:03:33.190> the<00:03:33.430> songs<00:03:33.670> from<00:03:33.940> your<00:03:34.090> head

00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:34.270

00:05:21.360 --> 00:05:21.370 
head unit like this although what I end

00:05:21.370 --> 00:05:23.779 
head unit like this although what I end
up<00:05:21.550> usually<00:05:21.909> doing<00:05:22.360> is<00:05:22.479> just<00:05:22.749> putting<00:05:22.870> it<00:05:23.319> on

00:05:23.779 --> 00:05:23.789 
up usually doing is just putting it on

00:05:23.789 --> 00:05:26.909 
up usually doing is just putting it on
this<00:05:24.789> mode<00:05:25.149> which<00:05:25.839> then<00:05:26.080> gives<00:05:26.319> you<00:05:26.439> control

00:05:26.909 --> 00:05:26.919 
this mode which then gives you control

00:05:26.919 --> 00:05:30.350 
this mode which then gives you control
to<00:05:27.779> select<00:05:28.779> your<00:05:29.080> songs<00:05:29.349> through<00:05:29.710> the<00:05:29.800> iPhone

00:05:30.350 --> 00:05:30.360 
to select your songs through the iPhone

00:05:30.360 --> 00:05:33.119 
to select your songs through the iPhone
so<00:05:31.360> again<00:05:31.629> this<00:05:31.809> is<00:05:31.990> just<00:05:32.229> a<00:05:32.349> video<00:05:32.499> to<00:05:32.710> show

00:05:33.119 --> 00:05:33.129 
so again this is just a video to show

00:05:33.129 --> 00:05:36.869 
so again this is just a video to show
that<00:05:33.909> the<00:05:34.240> iPhone<00:05:34.659> 5<00:05:34.960> and<00:05:35.409> the<00:05:36.249> lightning

00:05:36.869 --> 00:05:36.879 
that the iPhone 5 and the lightning

00:05:36.879 --> 00:05:40.320 
that the iPhone 5 and the lightning
cable<00:05:37.120> is<00:05:37.749> compatible<00:05:38.740> with<00:05:38.979> Sony<00:05:39.699> head<00:05:39.969> units

00:05:40.320 --> 00:05:40.330

such<00:05:40.629> as<00:05:40.870> this<00:05:41.289> model<00:05:42.210> to<00:05:43.210> my<00:05:43.360> knowledge<00:05:43.599> there

00:05:43.980 --> 00:05:43.990 
such as this model to my knowledge there

00:05:43.990 --> 00:05:45.929 
such as this model to my knowledge there
hasn't<00:05:44.199> been<00:05:44.379> any<00:05:44.740> kind<00:05:45.069> of<00:05:45.189> confirmation<00:05:45.849> on

00:05:45.929 --> 00:05:45.939 
hasn't been any kind of confirmation on

00:05:45.939 --> 00:05:48.959 
hasn't been any kind of confirmation on
the<00:05:46.060> internet<00:05:46.389> for<00:05:47.080> this<00:05:47.199> question<00:05:47.499> so<00:05:48.490> when<00:05:48.939> I

00:05:48.959 --> 00:05:48.969 
the internet for this question so when I

00:05:48.969 --> 00:05:51.059 
the internet for this question so when I
found<00:05:49.240> it<00:05:49.419> out<00:05:49.539> for<00:05:49.749> myself<00:05:49.870> I<00:05:50.409> thought<00:05:50.770> it

00:05:51.059 --> 00:05:51.069 
found it out for myself I thought it

00:05:51.069 --> 00:05:53.760 
found it out for myself I thought it
would<00:05:51.189> be<00:05:51.310> necessary<00:05:51.490> to<00:05:51.879> make<00:05:52.449> a<00:05:52.990> video<00:05:53.229> and

00:05:53.760 --> 00:05:53.770 
would be necessary to make a video and

00:05:53.770 --> 00:05:55.139 
would be necessary to make a video and
show<00:05:54.039> people<00:05:54.219> because<00:05:54.550> I'm<00:05:54.669> sure<00:05:54.909> there's

00:05:55.139 --> 00:05:55.149 
show people because I'm sure there's

00:05:55.149 --> 00:05:57.179 
show people because I'm sure there's
some<00:05:55.389> other<00:05:55.449> people<00:05:55.719> out<00:05:56.020> there<00:05:56.289> that<00:05:57.129> have

it<00:06:13.120> is<00:06:13.240> the<00:06:13.569> one<00:06:13.749> that<00:06:13.959> goes<00:06:14.289> on<00:06:14.319> to<00:06:15.039> your

00:06:15.829 --> 00:06:15.839 
it is the one that goes on to your

00:06:15.839 --> 00:06:18.869 
it is the one that goes on to your
existing<00:06:16.839> 30<00:06:17.080> pin<00:06:17.319> and<00:06:17.589> turns<00:06:18.310> it<00:06:18.430> into<00:06:18.459> the

00:06:18.869 --> 00:06:18.879 
existing 30 pin and turns it into the

lightning cable I don't have one of

00:06:21.729 --> 00:06:24.360 
lightning cable I don't have one of
those<00:06:21.879> adapters<00:06:22.209> so<00:06:22.479> I<00:06:22.689> can't<00:06:23.020> test<00:06:23.289> it<00:06:23.499> but

00:06:24.360 --> 00:06:24.370 
those adapters so I can't test it but

00:06:24.370 --> 00:06:27.689 
those adapters so I can't test it but
since<00:06:25.330> I<00:06:25.509> am<00:06:25.539> able<00:06:26.349> to<00:06:26.499> use<00:06:26.680> the<00:06:26.889> USB<00:06:27.159> cable

00:06:27.689 --> 00:06:27.699 
since I am able to use the USB cable

00:06:27.699 --> 00:06:28.379 
since I am able to use the USB cable
that<00:06:27.789> came<00:06:27.819> with<00:06:27.999> it

00:06:28.379 --> 00:06:28.389 
that came with it

00:06:28.389 --> 00:06:32.249 
that came with it
I'm<00:06:28.689> pretty<00:06:29.469> sure<00:06:29.740> that<00:06:30.719> it<00:06:31.719> would<00:06:32.199> be

00:06:32.249 --> 00:06:32.259 
I'm pretty sure that it would be

00:06:32.259 --> 00:06:35.909 
I'm pretty sure that it would be
compatible<00:06:33.930> exactly<00:06:34.930> the<00:06:35.050> same<00:06:35.259> as<00:06:35.499> what<00:06:35.800> I'm

00:06:35.909 --> 00:06:35.919 
compatible exactly the same as what I'm
