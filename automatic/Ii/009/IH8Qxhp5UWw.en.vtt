00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:40.020
 Today a cry of super Nocchetti 

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:44.489
 baked potatoes 

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:50.730
 we see the ingredients of the dumplings of 

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:56.640
 potatoes a bit of mozzarella cut in 

00:00:50.730 --> 00:01:01.010
 diced piccadilly tomatoes a little 

00:00:56.640 --> 00:01:05.460
 of breadcrumbs extra virgin olive oil 

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:09.090
 and a lot of basil but also a thing 

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:09.780
 important cheese that graters 

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:16.470
 oar 

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:17.490
 at the moment the dish is very easy from 

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:21.409
 prepare 

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:27.210
 put some oil on the bottom of the 

00:01:21.409 --> 00:01:38.759
 a sprinkle of your pan 

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:47.520
 breadcrumbs the gnocchi the cherry tomatoes 

00:01:38.759 --> 00:01:56.969
 cut the cubes together with the basil 

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:59.509
 worst of milk and parmesan 

00:01:56.969 --> 00:01:59.509
 grated 

00:02:06.470 --> 00:02:18.530
 add a little more oil to it 

00:02:14.210 --> 00:02:21.350
 surface is enough and now we mix 

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:24.010
 the whole is as if it were a kind of 

00:02:21.350 --> 00:02:24.010
 the three starts 

00:02:34.350 --> 00:02:45.430
 here is to discourage them for good inside the 

00:02:40.240 --> 00:02:50.980
 our baking dish and cover with 

00:02:45.430 --> 00:03:00.940
 very well sealed aluminum foil it 

00:02:50.980 --> 00:03:03.730
 just good and now pierce into 

00:03:00.940 --> 00:03:08.440
 surface a few holes 3 are enough 

00:03:03.730 --> 00:03:14.110
 a few here are so many more sealed bases 

00:03:08.440 --> 00:03:16.020
 better and now in the oven at 180 degrees for a 

00:03:14.110 --> 00:03:20.590
 quarter of an hour 

00:03:16.020 --> 00:03:30.520
 here is informed and they have already been pre 

00:03:20.590 --> 00:03:30.910
 warmed up and see you in a quarter 

00:03:30.520 --> 00:03:35.200
 now 

00:03:30.910 --> 00:03:37.510
 maybe even 20 minutes and here they are just 

00:03:35.200 --> 00:03:39.760
 you just need to get out of the oven 

00:03:37.510 --> 00:03:44.860
 add a little parmesan in 

00:03:39.760 --> 00:03:48.400
 surface and serve 

00:03:44.860 --> 00:03:51.959
 I recommend the recipe succeeds well 

00:03:48.400 --> 00:03:56.320
 only if the dumplings are 

00:03:51.959 --> 00:04:00.180
 very fresh and then in the oven I repeat 20 

00:03:56.320 --> 00:04:00.180
 180 degree minutes 

00:04:27.770 --> 00:04:34.460
 sorry but I put some pepper in it 

00:04:31.100 --> 00:04:34.460
 just happened 

00:04:36.630 --> 00:04:42.660
 I recommend fresh gnocchi 

00:04:40.410 --> 00:04:50.160
 if you don't care well with the juice of 

00:04:42.660 --> 00:05:00.320
 tomato the pink people a cream 

00:04:50.160 --> 00:05:00.320
 own religious 

00:05:02.050 --> 00:05:06.849
 bicicari tomato that must not be 

00:05:03.430 --> 00:05:09.639
 the dry one because if by past 

00:05:06.849 --> 00:05:15.729
 then the gnocchi do not do well 

00:05:09.639 --> 00:05:18.220
 instead I never tried the al 

00:05:15.729 --> 00:05:21.780
 bat but with piccadilly those 

00:05:18.220 --> 00:05:28.990
 slightly watery don't try me thesis 

00:05:21.780 --> 00:05:33.930
 a dish that perfectly succeeds 

00:05:28.990 --> 00:05:42.639
 flavor then in ten thousand because basil 

00:05:33.930 --> 00:05:49.560
 loop against the art of this cream 

00:05:42.639 --> 00:05:49.560
 sees a room the tomato is priceless 

00:05:50.849 --> 00:05:57.219
 an easy easy band dish you have 

00:05:53.469 --> 00:06:01.659

00:05:57.219 --> 00:06:03.789
