00:00:01.700 --> 00:00:02.810
TYLER PERRY: Oh, wow.

00:00:02.810 --> 00:00:04.420
Boy, this is fantastic.

00:00:04.420 --> 00:00:05.106
ELMO: [LAUGHS]

00:00:05.106 --> 00:00:06.022
TYLER PERRY: Hi, Elmo.

00:00:06.022 --> 00:00:07.710
ELMO: Hi, Mr. Tyler.

00:00:07.710 --> 00:00:09.410
Boy, that must be some snack.

00:00:09.410 --> 00:00:11.390
Ooh, what is Mr. Tyler having?

00:00:11.390 --> 00:00:13.500
TYLER PERRY: I am having
a plateful of math.

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:14.444
ELMO: Huh?

00:00:14.444 --> 00:00:17.849
Mr. Tyler, those just look
like tortilla chips to Elmo.

00:00:17.849 --> 00:00:20.140
TYLER PERRY: Oh, Elmo, they're
not just tortilla chips.

00:00:20.140 --> 00:00:22.030
This plate is full of math.

00:00:22.030 --> 00:00:23.486
ELMO: Elmo doesn't understand.

00:00:23.486 --> 00:00:25.432
How are tortilla chips math?

00:00:25.432 --> 00:00:26.890
TYLER PERRY: I'm
so glad you asked.

00:00:26.890 --> 00:00:28.660
We're going to get
to do some math.

00:00:28.660 --> 00:00:31.552
ELMO: Something tells
Elmo that math-- math

00:00:31.552 --> 00:00:33.480
gets Mr. Tyler very excited.

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:35.200
TYLER PERRY: Oh, you
bet it does, Elmo.

00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:37.740
Because look at this plate,
how many tortillas are there?

00:00:37.740 --> 00:00:39.400
ELMO: Well, Elmo's not sure.

00:00:39.400 --> 00:00:41.040
TYLER PERRY: Well,
how can we find out?

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:43.290
ELMO: Ooh, Elmo and
Mr. Tyler can count.

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:45.601
TYLER PERRY: Right,
and counting is math.

00:00:45.601 --> 00:00:46.100
ELMO: Yeah.

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:47.006
Let's count them.

00:00:47.006 --> 00:00:48.820
Ooh, and you count too.

00:00:48.820 --> 00:00:50.320
TYLER PERRY: OK, here we go.

00:00:50.320 --> 00:01:00.245
BOTH: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5,
6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12.

00:01:00.245 --> 00:01:02.620
TYLER PERRY: So there are 12
tortilla chips all together.

00:01:02.620 --> 00:01:04.567
ELMO: Ooh, Elmo gets it.

00:01:04.567 --> 00:01:05.859
Counting is math.

00:01:05.859 --> 00:01:07.400
TYLER PERRY: Yes,
but that's not all.

00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:07.620
ELMO: OK.

00:01:07.620 --> 00:01:08.227
It's not?

00:01:08.227 --> 00:01:09.060
TYLER PERRY: Oh, no.

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:10.643
There's a lot more
math on this plate.

00:01:10.643 --> 00:01:12.705
ELMO: Well, where, where?

00:01:12.705 --> 00:01:15.060
TYLER PERRY: Well,
check this out.

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:16.574
What is this shaped like?

00:01:16.574 --> 00:01:17.240
ELMO: Let's see.

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:21.470
Oh, the chip has 1, 2, 3 sides.

00:01:21.470 --> 00:01:22.460
TYLER PERRY: Yep.

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:26.320
ELMO: And 1, 2, 3 angles.

00:01:26.320 --> 00:01:28.975
Oh, so the chip is
shaped like a triangle.

00:01:28.975 --> 00:01:29.766
TYLER PERRY: Right.

00:01:29.766 --> 00:01:30.349
ELMO: [LAUGHS]

00:01:30.349 --> 00:01:32.070
TYLER PERRY: A triangle.

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:33.800
And what shape is the plate?

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:34.830
ELMO: Oh, let's see.

00:01:34.830 --> 00:01:40.485
Well, it looks like it has
two long sides and two shorter

00:01:40.485 --> 00:01:40.985
sides.

00:01:40.985 --> 00:01:41.693
TYLER PERRY: Yep.

00:01:41.693 --> 00:01:44.540
ELMO: So Elmo thinks
it's a rectangle.

00:01:44.540 --> 00:01:45.940
TYLER PERRY: Yes, yes.

00:01:45.940 --> 00:01:47.180
So you see that?

00:01:47.180 --> 00:01:49.982
You get a bunch of shapes
right here in your snack.

00:01:49.982 --> 00:01:50.846
ELMO: Cool.

00:01:50.846 --> 00:01:52.050
Shapes and counting.

00:01:52.050 --> 00:01:54.265
That's why the snack is math.

00:01:54.265 --> 00:01:55.865
TYLER PERRY: Yes,
but that's not all.

00:01:55.865 --> 00:01:56.760
ELMO: It's not?

00:01:56.760 --> 00:01:58.510
TYLER PERRY: TYLER
PERRY: [LAUGHS] No, no.

00:01:58.510 --> 00:01:59.140
Look at this.

00:01:59.140 --> 00:02:00.790
The chips are different
colors, right?

00:02:00.790 --> 00:02:01.290
ELMO: Hm mm.

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:02.074
Oh, let's see.

00:02:02.074 --> 00:02:04.450
Ah, oh, yeah.

00:02:04.450 --> 00:02:07.109
Some are yellow
and some are blue.

00:02:07.109 --> 00:02:07.900
TYLER PERRY: Right.

00:02:07.900 --> 00:02:10.101
So that means we can
sort them by color.

00:02:10.101 --> 00:02:12.350
We can put all the blue ones
on one side of the plate,

00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:14.558
and we can put all the yellow
ones on the other side.

00:02:14.558 --> 00:02:15.400
ELMO: Ah, cool.

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:16.384
Ooh, let's do it.

00:02:16.384 --> 00:02:17.550
TYLER PERRY: OK, let's sort.

00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:18.740
I was hoping you'd say that.

00:02:18.740 --> 00:02:19.180
ELMO: [LAUGHS].

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:20.305
TYLER PERRY: OK, let's see.

00:02:20.305 --> 00:02:25.371
We have 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7.

00:02:25.371 --> 00:02:25.912
ELMO: Yep, 7.

00:02:25.912 --> 00:02:27.010
TYLER PERRY: 7 yellows.

00:02:27.010 --> 00:02:27.510
OK.

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:29.353
So we'll put all of
them on one side.

00:02:29.353 --> 00:02:29.853
ELMO: OK.

00:02:29.853 --> 00:02:30.840
TYLER PERRY: Yep.

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:31.684
ELMO: There you go.

00:02:31.684 --> 00:02:32.350
TYLER PERRY: OK.

00:02:32.350 --> 00:02:33.850
ELMO: Now we can
count the blue chips.

00:02:33.850 --> 00:02:34.145
TYLER PERRY: Yes.

00:02:34.145 --> 00:02:34.645
ELMO: OK.

00:02:34.645 --> 00:02:40.922
So that's 1, 2, 3, 4, 5.

00:02:40.922 --> 00:02:43.173
5 blue chips all together.

00:02:43.173 --> 00:02:43.900
TYLER PERRY: Yes.

00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:44.630
So you see?

00:02:44.630 --> 00:02:46.475
Sorting is math.

00:02:46.475 --> 00:02:47.285
ELMO: Got it.

00:02:47.285 --> 00:02:48.076
TYLER PERRY: Hm mm.

00:02:48.076 --> 00:02:51.168
ELMO: So you can count
the snack, sort the snack,

00:02:51.168 --> 00:02:53.270
and find out the
shape of the snack.

00:02:53.270 --> 00:02:55.640
TYLER PERRY: Yeah,
but that's not all.

00:02:55.640 --> 00:02:56.840
ELMO: Come on.

00:02:56.840 --> 00:02:57.824
There's more math?

00:02:57.824 --> 00:02:59.240
TYLER PERRY: Oh,
you bet there is,

00:02:59.240 --> 00:03:00.470
and this is my favorite part.

00:03:00.470 --> 00:03:01.394
ELMO: Oh, what is it?

00:03:01.394 --> 00:03:05.090
What math are we going
to do with the snack now?

00:03:05.090 --> 00:03:06.780
TYLER PERRY: It's subtraction.

00:03:06.780 --> 00:03:07.570
ELMO: Subtraction?

00:03:07.570 --> 00:03:10.082
Well, how do we
subtract tortilla chips?

00:03:10.082 --> 00:03:11.290
TYLER PERRY: Well, like this.

00:03:11.290 --> 00:03:15.060
We have 12 chips,
and we take away 2.

00:03:15.060 --> 00:03:16.300
ELMO: Ooh.

00:03:16.300 --> 00:03:18.490
TYLER PERRY: So
how many are left?

00:03:18.490 --> 00:03:26.640
ELMO: 1, 2, 3, 4,
5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10.

00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:27.730
TYLER PERRY: Right.

00:03:27.730 --> 00:03:29.170
10 chips all together.

00:03:29.170 --> 00:03:30.170
ELMO: Wow.

00:03:30.170 --> 00:03:33.359
Elmo can't believe there's
so much math on one plate.

00:03:33.359 --> 00:03:35.650
TYLER PERRY: Well, there's
not just math on this plate,

00:03:35.650 --> 00:03:38.530
there's math in every place
you look and everywhere you go,

00:03:38.530 --> 00:03:39.100
Elmo.

00:03:39.100 --> 00:03:39.510
ELMO: Wow.

00:03:39.510 --> 00:03:40.260
TYLER PERRY: Yeah.

00:03:40.260 --> 00:03:42.900
ELMO: Well, Elmo's going to look
for math everywhere he goes.

00:03:42.900 --> 00:03:44.380
TYLER PERRY: That is so great.

00:03:44.380 --> 00:03:46.520
ELMO: Oh, but first,
let's keep subtracting.

00:03:46.520 --> 00:03:48.020
TYLER PERRY: Oh,
that's a good idea.

00:03:48.020 --> 00:03:48.662
ELMO: Hmm.

00:03:48.662 --> 00:03:49.370
TYLER PERRY: Hmm.

00:03:49.370 --> 00:03:50.210
ELMO: Yum, yum, yum, yum.

00:03:50.210 --> 00:03:50.930
TYLER PERRY: Hmm.

00:03:50.930 --> 00:03:51.720
I love math.

00:03:51.720 --> 00:03:54.631
ELMO: [LAUGHS] Elmo too.

00:03:54.631 --> 00:03:55.672
TYLER PERRY: Subtraction.

00:03:55.672 --> 00:03:56.231
ELMO: Oh, OK.

00:03:56.231 --> 00:03:57.480
TYLER PERRY: More subtraction.
