00:00:01.400 --> 00:00:05.210
 very good to all and welcome to 

00:00:03.440 --> 00:00:07.930
 Diary of an aquarium 

00:00:05.210 --> 00:00:07.930
 today we will talk about 

00:00:08.670 --> 00:00:13.350
 cookie things we're going to make a change 

00:00:11.520 --> 00:00:14.160
 of water quickly while we respond to 

00:00:13.350 --> 00:00:16.650
 some questions 

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:18.240
 louis asks the king prawns grow 

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:20.400
 a lot and they are aggressive they can be mixed 

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:22.439
 with the platini and female zebra fish 

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:24.869
 although I'm not an expert we have the 

00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:26.610
 prawns and prawns prawns 

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:28.080
 they grow quite a lot and even though they 

00:00:26.610 --> 00:00:30.300
 they feed on the substances that are 

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:32.460
 water currents also hunt 

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:34.199
 the smaller fish that they also 

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:36.660
 there are those who eat snails 

00:00:34.199 --> 00:00:38.430
 also ceders fish platies or betas 

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:40.530
 they are smaller than a prawns and 

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:42.900
 adults and from one day to the next 

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:44.640
 they can eat then we have the prawns 

00:00:42.900 --> 00:00:47.820
 that are smaller and what happens 

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:49.409
 opposite, some fish like beta 

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:51.659
 It suits the prawns although we put 

00:00:49.409 --> 00:00:53.879
 many hiding places for her later or 

00:00:51.659 --> 00:00:55.350
 early he would be eating the shrimp with silver 

00:00:53.879 --> 00:00:58.949
 and yes, yes, if you could match 

00:00:55.350 --> 00:01:00.960
 best bryant question I have an oscar fish 

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:03.540
 small that you recommend me to give you 

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:05.430
 eat the small oscar fish are 

00:01:03.540 --> 00:01:07.020
 accustomed to live food and they take 

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:08.790
 a couple of days to get used to eating 

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:11.430
 another type of food in nature 

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:13.049
 they eat fish fry and invertebrates 

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:15.030
 so if you can bring small 

00:01:13.049 --> 00:01:16.590
 live fish or insects and worms 

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:18.960
 that fit him by the mouth would be the best 

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:20.820
 being small can accept food in 

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:22.799
 the frozen beds and happy fairy 

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:24.420
 I recommend giving it a mix of everything and 

00:01:22.799 --> 00:01:26.549
 also make him porridge with fish and 

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:28.020
 seafood and a little vegetable if it is very 

00:01:26.549 --> 00:01:29.729
 small you can give him food for 

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:31.619
 fry and especially having that line 

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:33.330
 which can be live or frozen and also 

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:35.190
 could give you micro worms of oats or 

00:01:33.330 --> 00:01:36.960
 flour worms a home method 

00:01:35.190 --> 00:01:38.820
 to get live food would be to put 

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:40.890
 fruit in a pot and put in search of the 

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:43.350
 fruits leaving the young or pulsed and 

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:45.750
 how rich you always fed your 

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:48.090
 pc at breakfast and before sleep and 

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:49.860
 Alejandro says I have a female gouge and 

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:51.630
 he had four fry he makes a couple of 

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:54.060
 weeks but you have not removed the 

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:55.979
 little black dot is normal or not elementary 

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:57.990
 dear watson this is normal of the 

00:01:55.979 --> 00:01:59.700
 bukis may have few offspring today and 

00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:01.050
 keeping that black point we will know that 

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:03.149
 soon to go to a new batch of 

00:02:01.050 --> 00:02:05.009
 fry why should be in a 

00:02:03.149 --> 00:02:06.990
 paridera if you are chubby or have a lot 

00:02:05.009 --> 00:02:08.160
 vegetation hiding places for the young if 

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:10.380
 you want them to survive 

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:12.090
 postdata if you want more male fingerlings 

00:02:10.380 --> 00:02:13.950
 you can set the temperature to 29 degrees 

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:16.290
 and if you want more females put the 

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:17.819
 temperature to 22 degrees good good 

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:19.170
 well the time runs out the video is 

00:02:17.819 --> 00:02:21.320
 just saying I want but I have to 

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:21.320
 go away
