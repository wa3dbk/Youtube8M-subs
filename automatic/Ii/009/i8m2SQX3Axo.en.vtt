I've tried four or five min and they
don't<00:01:57.930> work<00:01:58.110> but<00:01:58.740> he's<00:01:58.920> do<00:01:59.189> so<00:01:59.369> he's<00:01:59.520> obviously

00:01:59.719 --> 00:01:59.729 
don't work but he's do so he's obviously

sticking straight to the book and

00:02:28.770 --> 00:02:31.130 
sticking straight to the book and
getting<00:02:29.160> it<00:02:29.340> to<00:02:29.490> work<00:02:29.670> out<00:02:29.910> of<00:02:30.000> the<00:02:30.180> box<00:02:30.360> plug

getting it to work out of the box plug

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:32.990 
getting it to work out of the box plug
and<00:02:31.320> play<00:02:31.530> so<00:02:32.400> that<00:02:32.520> you<00:02:32.610> know<00:02:32.730> it's<00:02:32.850> going<00:02:32.940> to

00:02:32.990 --> 00:02:33.000 
and play so that you know it's going to

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:36.620 
and play so that you know it's going to
work<00:02:33.180> straight<00:02:33.450> off<00:02:33.660> the<00:02:33.690> bat<00:02:34.730> this<00:02:35.730> census

00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:36.630 
work straight off the bat this census

00:02:36.630 --> 00:02:42.440 
work straight off the bat this census
the<00:02:37.670> movement<00:02:38.670> of<00:02:38.790> air<00:02:39.030> mass<00:02:39.680> and<00:02:40.790> also<00:02:41.790> can

00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:42.450 
the movement of air mass and also can

00:02:42.450 --> 00:02:46.130 
the movement of air mass and also can
compensate<00:02:42.870> for<00:02:43.620> the<00:02:44.340> air<00:02:45.180> speed<00:02:45.600> around<00:02:45.750> it

00:02:46.130 --> 00:02:46.140 
compensate for the air speed around it

00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:47.390 
compensate for the air speed around it
so<00:02:46.320> essentially<00:02:46.770> what<00:02:46.860> you're<00:02:46.920> having<00:02:47.280> is

00:02:47.390 --> 00:02:47.400 
so essentially what you're having is

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:50.300 
so essentially what you're having is
that<00:02:47.430> you<00:02:47.700> with<00:02:47.940> the<00:02:48.060> data<00:02:48.330> vario<00:02:48.810> itself<00:02:49.320> with

00:02:50.300 --> 00:02:50.310 
that you with the data vario itself with

00:02:50.310 --> 00:02:53.810 
that you with the data vario itself with
its<00:02:50.340> onboard<00:02:50.610> our<00:02:50.970> tuna<00:02:51.440> is<00:02:52.440> a<00:02:52.620> baseline<00:02:53.190> it

00:02:53.810 --> 00:02:53.820 
its onboard our tuna is a baseline it

00:02:53.820 --> 00:02:56.930 
its onboard our tuna is a baseline it
then<00:02:54.090> adds<00:02:54.390> or<00:02:54.690> subtracts<00:02:54.720> the<00:02:55.940> compensation

00:02:56.930 --> 00:02:56.940 
then adds or subtracts the compensation

00:02:56.940 --> 00:02:58.400 
then adds or subtracts the compensation
of<00:02:57.060> the<00:02:57.150> mass<00:02:57.330> air<00:02:57.570> movement<00:02:57.810> on<00:02:58.080> the<00:02:58.200> tech

00:02:58.400 --> 00:02:58.410 
of the mass air movement on the tech

of the mass air movement on the tech

00:03:02.960 --> 00:03:02.970 
probe this gives it a reading a baseline

00:03:02.970 --> 00:03:04.780 
probe this gives it a reading a baseline
reading<00:03:03.360> then<00:03:03.510> or<00:03:03.630> whether<00:03:03.840> the<00:03:04.020> glider<00:03:04.260> is

00:04:15.540 --> 00:04:17.780 
that minimum voltage alarm you have to
input<00:04:15.720> what<00:04:16.290> voltage<00:04:16.890> you<00:04:17.130> want<00:04:17.340> it<00:04:17.400> to<00:04:17.489> go<00:04:17.609> out

00:04:17.780 --> 00:04:17.790 
input what voltage you want it to go out

00:04:17.790 --> 00:04:19.159 
input what voltage you want it to go out
so<00:04:18.000> if<00:04:18.180> we're<00:04:18.330> talking<00:04:18.450> lithium<00:04:18.989> polymer

00:04:19.159 --> 00:04:19.169 
so if we're talking lithium polymer

00:04:19.169 --> 00:04:23.000 
so if we're talking lithium polymer
cells<00:04:19.590> I<00:04:20.370> would<00:04:20.910> recommend<00:04:21.330> between<00:04:22.080> 3.3<00:04:22.860> and

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:23.010 
cells I would recommend between 3.3 and

00:04:23.010 --> 00:04:24.530 
cells I would recommend between 3.3 and
3.5<00:04:23.880> volts

00:04:24.530 --> 00:04:24.540 
3.5 volts

00:04:24.540 --> 00:04:28.880 
3.5 volts
Purcell<00:04:26.630> because<00:04:27.630> I<00:04:27.660> live<00:04:27.870> in<00:04:27.960> a<00:04:28.020> warm<00:04:28.650> climate

00:04:28.880 --> 00:04:28.890 
Purcell because I live in a warm climate

00:04:28.890 --> 00:04:32.090 
Purcell because I live in a warm climate
I'll<00:04:29.490> set<00:04:29.760> that<00:04:29.790> to<00:04:30.030> 3.5<00:04:30.750> I've<00:04:31.230> had<00:04:31.500> a<00:04:31.530> fire<00:04:31.890> on

00:04:32.090 --> 00:04:32.100 
I'll set that to 3.5 I've had a fire on

00:04:32.100 --> 00:04:35.630 
I'll set that to 3.5 I've had a fire on
a<00:04:33.170> lithium<00:04:34.170> polymer<00:04:34.290> battery<00:04:35.070> fire<00:04:35.400> on<00:04:35.610> board

00:04:35.630 --> 00:04:35.640 
a lithium polymer battery fire on board

00:04:35.640 --> 00:04:39.200 
a lithium polymer battery fire on board
here<00:04:36.030> from<00:04:36.180> a<00:04:36.270> motor<00:04:36.480> battery<00:04:37.130> and<00:04:38.130> I<00:04:38.790> don't

00:04:39.200 --> 00:04:39.210 
here from a motor battery and I don't

00:04:39.210 --> 00:04:40.790 
here from a motor battery and I don't
actually<00:04:39.360> go<00:04:39.630> through<00:04:39.660> that<00:04:39.930> again<00:04:40.080> so<00:04:40.530> this

00:04:40.790 --> 00:04:40.800 
actually go through that again so this

00:04:40.800 --> 00:04:43.550 
actually go through that again so this
for<00:04:41.040> me<00:04:41.160> is<00:04:41.280> a<00:04:41.310> particular<00:04:42.440> nifty<00:04:43.440> little

00:04:43.550 --> 00:04:43.560 
for me is a particular nifty little

00:04:43.560 --> 00:04:48.700 
for me is a particular nifty little
piece<00:04:43.770> of<00:04:43.920> kit<00:04:44.630> now<00:04:45.630> these<00:04:46.170> come<00:04:46.470> with<00:04:46.970> solid

00:04:48.700 --> 00:04:48.710 
piece of kit now these come with solid

00:04:48.710 --> 00:04:51.920 
piece of kit now these come with solid
connectors<00:04:49.710> six<00:04:50.280> millimeter<00:04:50.700> I<00:04:50.970> use<00:04:51.630> five

00:04:51.920 --> 00:04:51.930 
connectors six millimeter I use five

00:04:51.930 --> 00:04:54.050 
connectors six millimeter I use five
point<00:04:52.440> five<00:04:52.650> millimeters<00:04:53.280> so<00:04:53.580> it<00:04:53.730> just<00:04:53.760> made

00:04:54.050 --> 00:04:54.060 
point five millimeters so it just made

00:04:54.060 --> 00:04:55.610 
point five millimeters so it just made
some<00:04:54.270> adapters<00:04:54.720> to<00:04:54.780> adapt<00:04:55.230> it<00:04:55.380> to<00:04:55.410> my

00:04:55.610 --> 00:04:55.620 
some adapters to adapt it to my

00:04:55.620 --> 00:04:57.530 
some adapters to adapt it to my
batteries<00:04:56.100> my<00:04:56.430> speed<00:04:56.760> control<00:04:57.090> so<00:04:57.330> I<00:04:57.360> don't

00:04:57.530 --> 00:04:57.540 
batteries my speed control so I don't

00:04:57.540 --> 00:04:58.970 
batteries my speed control so I don't
have<00:04:57.600> to<00:04:57.690> change<00:04:57.930> my<00:04:58.050> whole<00:04:58.290> fleet<00:04:58.950> of

00:04:58.970 --> 00:04:58.980 
have to change my whole fleet of

00:04:58.980 --> 00:05:00.590 
have to change my whole fleet of
batteries<00:04:59.430> and<00:04:59.610> fleet<00:04:59.790> of<00:04:59.910> speed<00:05:00.090> controllers

00:05:00.590 --> 00:05:00.600 
batteries and fleet of speed controllers

00:05:00.600 --> 00:05:04.370 
batteries and fleet of speed controllers
so<00:05:01.200> you<00:05:01.290> can<00:05:01.470> do<00:05:01.620> that<00:05:01.800> it's<00:05:01.920> no<00:05:02.040> problem
