we're working with is that the Traxxas

00:00:34.730 --> 00:00:37.780 
we're working with is that the Traxxas
4x4<00:00:35.800> and<00:00:36.800> as<00:00:37.129> you<00:00:37.220> can<00:00:37.309> see<00:00:37.370> it's<00:00:37.640> got<00:00:37.760> the

00:00:37.780 --> 00:00:37.790 
4x4 and as you can see it's got the

00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:41.920 
4x4 and as you can see it's got the
villi<00:00:38.030> on<00:00:38.230> motor<00:00:39.230> and<00:00:39.530> ESC<00:00:39.710> with<00:00:40.339> the<00:00:40.930> stock

00:00:41.920 --> 00:00:41.930 
villi on motor and ESC with the stock

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:44.020 
villi on motor and ESC with the stock
tracks<00:00:42.230> as<00:00:42.379> 2.4<00:00:42.680> gigahertz<00:00:43.160> radio<00:00:43.580> and

00:00:44.020 --> 00:00:44.030 
tracks as 2.4 gigahertz radio and

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:48.520 
tracks as 2.4 gigahertz radio and
receiver<00:00:44.540> in<00:00:44.809> there<00:00:45.050> so<00:00:46.930> what<00:00:47.930> we<00:00:48.079> want<00:00:48.320> to<00:00:48.409> do

00:00:48.520 --> 00:00:48.530 
receiver in there so what we want to do

00:00:48.530 --> 00:00:51.069 
receiver in there so what we want to do
is<00:00:48.710> disable<00:00:49.040> reverse<00:00:49.629> but<00:00:50.629> before<00:00:50.899> I<00:00:50.930> do<00:00:50.989> that

00:00:51.069 --> 00:00:51.079 
is disable reverse but before I do that

00:00:51.079 --> 00:00:52.810 
is disable reverse but before I do that
I<00:00:51.230> just<00:00:51.260> want<00:00:51.530> to<00:00:51.620> cover<00:00:51.890> the<00:00:52.160> three<00:00:52.190> modes

00:00:52.810 --> 00:00:52.820 
I just want to cover the three modes

00:00:52.820 --> 00:00:56.380 
I just want to cover the three modes
that<00:00:53.300> comes<00:00:53.570> with<00:00:53.809> this<00:00:53.960> ESC<00:00:54.730> mode<00:00:55.730> one<00:00:56.090> is<00:00:56.300> a

00:00:56.380 --> 00:00:56.390 
that comes with this ESC mode one is a

00:00:56.390 --> 00:00:59.500 
that comes with this ESC mode one is a
hundred<00:00:56.899> cent<00:00:57.079> throttle<00:00:57.890> 100%<00:00:58.550> reversed<00:00:58.940> and

00:00:59.500 --> 00:00:59.510 
hundred cent throttle 100% reversed and

00:00:59.510 --> 00:01:01.510 
hundred cent throttle 100% reversed and
a<00:01:00.050> half<00:01:00.170> percent<00:01:00.289> break<00:01:00.800> so<00:01:01.190> you<00:01:01.219> can<00:01:01.399> go

00:01:01.510 --> 00:01:01.520 
a half percent break so you can go

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:04.060 
a half percent break so you can go
forward<00:01:01.850> backwards<00:01:02.329> and<00:01:02.510> brake<00:01:02.809> mode<00:01:03.410> two<00:01:03.710> is

00:01:04.060 --> 00:01:04.070 
forward backwards and brake mode two is

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:06.370 
forward backwards and brake mode two is
a<00:01:04.519> half<00:01:04.670> percent<00:01:04.970> throttle<00:01:05.630> one<00:01:06.080> percent

00:01:06.370 --> 00:01:06.380 
a half percent throttle one percent

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:08.740 
a half percent throttle one percent
brake<00:01:06.710> and<00:01:07.009> zero<00:01:07.490> reverse<00:01:07.940> now<00:01:08.180> this<00:01:08.330> is<00:01:08.509> the

00:01:08.740 --> 00:01:08.750 
brake and zero reverse now this is the

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:10.749 
brake and zero reverse now this is the
mode<00:01:08.960> you're<00:01:09.110> gonna<00:01:09.229> be<00:01:09.380> want<00:01:09.619> you<00:01:10.190> will<00:01:10.490> want

00:01:21.999 --> 00:01:22.009 
reverse a half percent brake so okay

00:01:22.009 --> 00:01:26.889 
reverse a half percent brake so okay
let's<00:01:22.220> go<00:01:22.340> ahead<00:01:22.610> and<00:01:23.890> disable<00:01:25.690> reverse<00:01:26.690> on

00:01:26.889 --> 00:01:26.899 
let's go ahead and disable reverse on

00:01:26.899 --> 00:01:29.770 
let's go ahead and disable reverse on
this<00:01:27.080> so<00:01:27.610> with<00:01:28.610> the<00:01:28.759> battery<00:01:29.060> hooked<00:01:29.240> up<00:01:29.450> to

00:01:29.770 --> 00:01:29.780 
this so with the battery hooked up to

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:32.800 
this so with the battery hooked up to
your<00:01:30.319> electronics<00:01:31.250> here<00:01:31.490> just<00:01:32.270> go<00:01:32.420> ahead<00:01:32.660> and

turn on your ESC just like you normally

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:35.770 
turn on your ESC just like you normally
would

00:01:35.770 --> 00:01:35.780 
would

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:38.979 
would
except<00:01:36.530> don't<00:01:37.340> release<00:01:37.729> right<00:01:38.000> away<00:01:38.239> when<00:01:38.869> you

00:01:38.979 --> 00:01:38.989 
except don't release right away when you

00:01:38.989 --> 00:01:41.859 
except don't release right away when you
hold<00:01:39.770> it<00:01:39.950> down<00:01:40.130> it's<00:01:40.610> gonna<00:01:40.759> flash<00:01:41.119> green<00:01:41.599> and

00:01:41.859 --> 00:01:41.869 
hold it down it's gonna flash green and

00:01:41.869 --> 00:01:44.460 
hold it down it's gonna flash green and
then<00:01:42.259> it's<00:01:42.380> gonna<00:01:42.560> go<00:01:42.770> through<00:01:43.009> the<00:01:43.130> modes

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:44.470 
then it's gonna go through the modes

00:01:44.470 --> 00:01:48.130 
then it's gonna go through the modes
that<00:01:45.470> was<00:01:45.679> one<00:01:46.069> blink<00:01:46.340> to<00:01:46.459> us<00:01:46.580> mode<00:01:47.450> one<00:01:47.690> two

00:01:48.130 --> 00:01:48.140 
that was one blink to us mode one two

00:01:48.140 --> 00:01:50.469 
that was one blink to us mode one two
was<00:01:48.380> mode<00:01:48.590> two<00:01:48.860> three<00:01:49.520> is<00:01:49.640> mode<00:01:49.849> three<00:01:50.209> and

00:01:50.469 --> 00:01:50.479 
was mode two three is mode three and

00:01:50.479 --> 00:01:52.690 
was mode two three is mode three and
it's<00:01:50.720> gonna<00:01:50.840> cycle<00:01:51.289> through<00:01:51.739> what<00:01:52.310> we<00:01:52.399> want<00:01:52.580> is

00:01:52.690 --> 00:01:52.700 
it's gonna cycle through what we want is

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:59.020 
it's gonna cycle through what we want is
mode<00:01:52.940> two<00:01:53.270> so<00:01:55.030> that's<00:01:56.030> two<00:01:56.390> whoops<00:01:57.520> okay<00:01:58.520> I<00:01:58.759> let

00:01:59.020 --> 00:01:59.030 
mode two so that's two whoops okay I let

00:01:59.030 --> 00:02:01.029 
mode two so that's two whoops okay I let
it<00:01:59.149> go<00:01:59.270> so<00:01:59.569> we're<00:01:59.810> gonna<00:01:59.899> wait<00:02:00.200> another<00:02:00.770> few

00:02:01.029 --> 00:02:01.039 
it go so we're gonna wait another few

00:02:01.039 --> 00:02:05.139 
it go so we're gonna wait another few
seconds<00:02:01.399> here<00:02:01.690> one<00:02:02.690> two<00:02:03.590> when<00:02:03.950> it's<00:02:04.129> to<00:02:04.369> let<00:02:04.940> go

00:02:05.139 --> 00:02:05.149 
seconds here one two when it's to let go

00:02:05.149 --> 00:02:07.210 
seconds here one two when it's to let go
and<00:02:05.390> then<00:02:05.750> the<00:02:05.899> light<00:02:06.229> will<00:02:06.259> turn<00:02:06.560> green<00:02:06.619> when

00:02:07.210 --> 00:02:07.220 
and then the light will turn green when

00:02:07.220 --> 00:02:09.839 
and then the light will turn green when
it's<00:02:07.369> green<00:02:07.610> like<00:02:07.819> that<00:02:07.849> that<00:02:08.720> means<00:02:08.869> that

00:02:09.839 --> 00:02:09.849 
it's green like that that means that
