a patent part of our patent really makes

00:01:23.939 --> 00:01:25.520 
a patent part of our patent really makes
our<00:01:24.060> product<00:01:24.390> a<00:01:24.450> better<00:01:24.600> product<00:01:24.869> is<00:01:25.110> with

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:25.530 
our product a better product is with

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:27.649 
our product a better product is with
this<00:01:25.650> little<00:01:25.920> ball<00:01:26.159> bearing<00:01:26.610> this<00:01:27.390> little

00:01:27.649 --> 00:01:27.659 
this little ball bearing this little

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:29.630 
this little ball bearing this little
ball<00:01:27.780> bearing<00:01:28.229> allows<00:01:28.650> the<00:01:28.950> end<00:01:29.130> to<00:01:29.280> spin

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:29.640 
ball bearing allows the end to spin

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:32.179 
ball bearing allows the end to spin
independently<00:01:30.420> of<00:01:30.600> the<00:01:30.689> cable<00:01:31.079> so<00:01:31.770> it's<00:01:32.009> never

00:01:32.179 --> 00:01:32.189 
independently of the cable so it's never

00:01:32.189 --> 00:01:34.640 
independently of the cable so it's never
get<00:01:32.490> twisted<00:01:32.790> up<00:01:33.119> it's<00:01:33.750> not<00:01:33.990> going<00:01:34.200> to<00:01:34.320> hurt

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:34.650 
get twisted up it's not going to hurt

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:36.350 
get twisted up it's not going to hurt
the<00:01:34.860> integrity<00:01:35.280> of<00:01:35.310> the<00:01:35.490> rubber<00:01:35.700> or<00:01:36.270> the

earpieces so it's not going to you know

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:39.980 
earpieces so it's not going to you know
been<00:01:38.610> to<00:01:38.759> break<00:01:38.939> over<00:01:39.119> some<00:01:39.750> of<00:01:39.810> our

been to break over some of our
competitors<00:01:40.110> have<00:01:40.799> come<00:01:40.950> in<00:01:41.070> and<00:01:41.220> heat<00:01:41.640> molded

00:01:42.109 --> 00:01:42.119 
competitors have come in and heat molded

00:01:42.119 --> 00:01:43.940 
competitors have come in and heat molded
there's<00:01:42.360> together<00:01:42.780> because<00:01:43.470> our<00:01:43.619> patent

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:43.950 
there's together because our patent

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:47.600 
there's together because our patent
involves<00:01:44.280> the<00:01:44.369> ball<00:01:44.520> bearing<00:01:44.939> and<00:01:45.649> again<00:01:46.649> it

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:47.610 
involves the ball bearing and again it

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:49.880 
involves the ball bearing and again it
just<00:01:47.880> doesn't<00:01:48.030> perform<00:01:48.270> as<00:01:48.630> well<00:01:48.659> since<00:01:49.350> a<00:01:49.560> big
