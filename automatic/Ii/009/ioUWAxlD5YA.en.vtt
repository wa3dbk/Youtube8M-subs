00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:55.750 
all right I got to nuts off and the bolt

00:01:55.750 --> 00:01:58.180 
all right I got to nuts off and the bolt
and<00:01:56.750> as<00:01:56.870> you<00:01:57.020> can<00:01:57.110> see<00:01:57.170> right<00:01:57.470> here<00:01:57.680> there's

00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:02.570 
cylinder top device

00:02:02.570 --> 00:02:06.850 
cylinder top device
I<00:02:03.010> took<00:02:04.010> an<00:02:04.610> 8<00:02:04.760> millimeter<00:02:05.680> ratchet<00:02:06.680> wrench

00:02:06.850 --> 00:02:06.860 
I took an 8 millimeter ratchet wrench

00:02:06.860 --> 00:02:10.540 
I took an 8 millimeter ratchet wrench
and<00:02:07.600> the<00:02:08.600> hex<00:02:08.810> head<00:02:09.020> and<00:02:09.890> I<00:02:09.950> put<00:02:10.130> it<00:02:10.220> on<00:02:10.340> there

00:02:10.540 --> 00:02:10.550 
and the hex head and I put it on there

00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:12.910 
and the hex head and I put it on there
since<00:02:11.300> you<00:02:11.450> can't<00:02:11.660> get<00:02:11.840> a<00:02:12.080> regular<00:02:12.560> socket

00:02:12.910 --> 00:02:12.920 
since you can't get a regular socket

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:15.570 
since you can't get a regular socket
down<00:02:13.040> in<00:02:13.190> the<00:02:13.280> hole<00:02:13.570> so<00:02:14.570> on<00:02:14.690> and<00:02:14.810> so<00:02:14.900> forth<00:02:15.200> just

00:02:15.570 --> 00:02:15.580 
down in the hole so on and so forth just

00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:18.010 
down in the hole so on and so forth just
a<00:02:16.580> little<00:02:16.790> tip<00:02:17.180> to<00:02:17.360> make<00:02:17.660> this<00:02:17.780> a<00:02:17.840> little

00:02:18.010 --> 00:02:18.020 
a little tip to make this a little

00:02:18.020 --> 00:02:22.330 
a little tip to make this a little
easier<00:02:18.200> for<00:02:18.410> you<00:02:20.830> there's<00:02:21.830> the<00:02:21.980> difference<00:02:22.250> in

00:02:22.330 --> 00:02:22.340 
easier for you there's the difference in

00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:26.380 
easier for you there's the difference in
the<00:02:22.430> lowering<00:02:22.700> springs<00:02:25.030> alright<00:02:26.030> next<00:02:26.180> step

00:02:26.380 --> 00:02:26.390 
the lowering springs alright next step

00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:30.820 
the lowering springs alright next step
on<00:02:26.570> taking<00:02:26.990> these<00:02:27.140> stretch<00:02:27.410> out<00:02:29.740> there's<00:02:30.740> a

00:02:30.820 --> 00:02:30.830 
on taking these stretch out there's a

00:02:30.830 --> 00:02:33.250 
on taking these stretch out there's a
bolt<00:02:31.070> that<00:02:31.220> goes<00:02:31.280> right<00:02:31.670> here<00:02:31.930> that<00:02:32.930> comes<00:02:33.110> off

00:02:33.250 --> 00:02:33.260 
bolt that goes right here that comes off

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:35.920 
bolt that goes right here that comes off
the<00:02:33.290> upper<00:02:33.620> ball<00:02:33.770> joint<00:02:34.330> to<00:02:35.330> take<00:02:35.540> that<00:02:35.720> bolt

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:35.930 
the upper ball joint to take that bolt

00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:38.280 
the upper ball joint to take that bolt
loose<00:02:36.250> smack<00:02:37.250> right<00:02:37.490> here<00:02:37.670> with<00:02:37.850> a<00:02:37.910> hammer

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:38.290 
loose smack right here with a hammer

00:02:38.290 --> 00:02:41.410 
loose smack right here with a hammer
it'll<00:02:39.290> break<00:02:39.709> loose<00:02:39.980> and<00:02:40.220> then<00:02:40.310> you<00:02:40.430> can<00:02:40.610> pull

00:02:41.410 --> 00:02:41.420 
it'll break loose and then you can pull

00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:47.500 
it'll break loose and then you can pull
this<00:02:45.280> pull<00:02:46.280> the<00:02:46.430> strut<00:02:46.700> and<00:02:47.060> shock<00:02:47.330> and

00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:47.510 
this pull the strut and shock and

00:02:47.510 --> 00:02:48.790 
this pull the strut and shock and
everything<00:02:47.540> and<00:02:47.900> then<00:02:48.020> this<00:02:48.170> just<00:02:48.350> comes<00:02:48.560> all

00:02:48.790 --> 00:02:48.800 
everything and then this just comes all

00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:54.250 
everything and then this just comes all
out<00:02:52.000> and<00:02:53.000> move<00:02:53.180> on<00:02:53.360> to<00:02:53.510> the<00:02:53.600> next<00:02:53.720> time<00:02:53.990> do<00:02:54.230> it

00:02:54.250 --> 00:02:54.260 
out and move on to the next time do it

00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:57.430 
out and move on to the next time do it
again<00:02:55.570> this<00:02:56.570> is<00:02:56.690> what<00:02:56.810> the<00:02:56.900> strut<00:02:57.110> looks<00:02:57.320> like

00:02:57.430 --> 00:02:57.440 
again this is what the strut looks like

00:02:57.440 --> 00:03:00.880 
again this is what the strut looks like
when<00:02:57.620> it<00:02:57.709> comes<00:02:57.800> out<00:02:59.350> what<00:03:00.350> you<00:03:00.440> got<00:03:00.560> to<00:03:00.650> do<00:03:00.709> is

00:03:00.880 --> 00:03:00.890 
when it comes out what you got to do is

00:03:00.890 --> 00:03:04.630 
when it comes out what you got to do is
you<00:03:00.950> could<00:03:01.100> take<00:03:02.410> spring<00:03:03.410> compressors<00:03:03.980> one<00:03:04.550> on

00:03:04.630 --> 00:03:04.640 
you could take spring compressors one on

00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:07.000 
you could take spring compressors one on

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:07.010 
either side here and compress the spring

00:03:07.010 --> 00:03:10.390 
either side here and compress the spring
down<00:03:07.810> on<00:03:08.810> top<00:03:09.110> this<00:03:09.980> is<00:03:10.130> going<00:03:10.250> to<00:03:10.310> be<00:03:10.370> a

00:03:10.390 --> 00:03:10.400 
down on top this is going to be a

00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:14.560
