00:00:05.089 --> 00:00:09.770 

counting<00:00:06.089> 299<00:00:06.569> was<00:00:06.960> easy<00:00:07.319> but<00:00:08.480> going<00:00:09.480> up<00:00:09.630> to

00:00:09.770 --> 00:00:09.780 
counting 299 was easy but going up to

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:12.589 
counting 299 was easy but going up to
the<00:00:09.900> hundreds<00:00:10.380> maybe<00:00:10.920> a<00:00:11.130> bit<00:00:11.309> difficult<00:00:11.599> so

00:00:12.589 --> 00:00:12.599 
the hundreds maybe a bit difficult so

00:00:12.599 --> 00:00:15.740 
the hundreds maybe a bit difficult so
hang<00:00:13.139> on<00:00:13.759> the<00:00:14.759> hundreds<00:00:15.120> are<00:00:15.240> formed<00:00:15.480> the<00:00:15.570> same

00:00:15.740 --> 00:00:15.750 
hang on the hundreds are formed the same

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:18.380 
hang on the hundreds are formed the same
way<00:00:15.900> as<00:00:16.020> the<00:00:16.199> tens<00:00:16.440> the<00:00:17.250> Chinese<00:00:17.580> word<00:00:17.820> for<00:00:17.850> 100

00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:18.390 
way as the tens the Chinese word for 100

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:29.060 
way as the tens the Chinese word for 100
is<00:00:18.800> by<00:00:22.160> so<00:00:23.330> 700<00:00:24.330> is<00:00:25.099> g'bye<00:00:27.380> but<00:00:28.380> wait<00:00:28.710> there's

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:29.070 
is by so 700 is g'bye but wait there's

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:33.680 
is by so 700 is g'bye but wait there's
one<00:00:29.910> small<00:00:30.090> difference<00:00:31.099> 100<00:00:32.099> includes<00:00:32.759> the<00:00:33.390> e

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:33.690 
one small difference 100 includes the e

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:40.010 
one small difference 100 includes the e
in<00:00:33.960> front<00:00:35.120> so<00:00:36.120> while<00:00:36.630> 10<00:00:37.050> is<00:00:37.230> just<00:00:37.530> sure<00:00:38.870> 100<00:00:39.870> is

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:40.020 
in front so while 10 is just sure 100 is

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:45.260 
in front so while 10 is just sure 100 is
e<00:00:40.309> x<00:00:42.050> notice<00:00:43.050> how<00:00:43.410> the<00:00:43.469> tone<00:00:43.860> and<00:00:44.100> II<00:00:44.280> changes

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:45.270 
e x notice how the tone and II changes

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:47.750 
e x notice how the tone and II changes
when<00:00:45.450> placed<00:00:45.719> in<00:00:45.930> front<00:00:46.079> of<00:00:46.260> the<00:00:46.379> x<00:00:46.530> it's<00:00:47.520> the

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:47.760 
when placed in front of the x it's the

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:51.500 
when placed in front of the x it's the
fourth<00:00:48.030> tone<00:00:48.300> e<00:00:48.710> by<00:00:49.850> now<00:00:50.850> how<00:00:51.030> do<00:00:51.090> you<00:00:51.210> get<00:00:51.360> all

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:51.510 
fourth tone e by now how do you get all

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:53.720 
fourth tone e by now how do you get all
the<00:00:51.660> in<00:00:51.780> between<00:00:52.110> numbers<00:00:52.320> in<00:00:52.739> the<00:00:53.280> hundreds

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:53.730 
the in between numbers in the hundreds

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:56.360 
the in between numbers in the hundreds
just<00:00:54.660> like<00:00:54.899> the<00:00:55.079> tens<00:00:55.320> just<00:00:55.890> add<00:00:56.039> into<00:00:56.309> the

00:00:56.360 --> 00:00:56.370 
just like the tens just add into the

00:00:56.370 --> 00:01:02.709 
just like the tens just add into the
back<00:00:57.109> so<00:00:58.109> for<00:00:58.559> example<00:00:59.239> 345<00:01:00.239> is<00:01:01.190> sent<00:01:02.190> by

00:01:02.709 --> 00:01:02.719 
back so for example 345 is sent by

00:01:02.719 --> 00:01:09.800 
back so for example 345 is sent by
sister<00:01:03.719> who<00:01:04.820> Sam<00:01:05.820> by<00:01:06.890> who<00:01:08.210> but<00:01:09.210> wait<00:01:09.540> again

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:09.810 
sister who Sam by who but wait again

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:11.899 
sister who Sam by who but wait again
there<00:01:10.409> are<00:01:10.530> some<00:01:10.770> exceptions<00:01:11.070> to<00:01:11.430> this<00:01:11.640> as

00:01:11.899 --> 00:01:11.909 
there are some exceptions to this as

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:17.200 
there are some exceptions to this as
well<00:01:11.960> first<00:01:12.960> of<00:01:13.170> all<00:01:13.290> 200<00:01:14.220> is<00:01:14.369> not<00:01:14.640> goodbye

00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:17.210 
well first of all 200 is not goodbye

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:23.390 
well first of all 200 is not goodbye
here<00:01:18.210> the<00:01:18.540> two<00:01:18.780> is<00:01:19.020> changed<00:01:19.710> into<00:01:20.420> the<00:01:21.420> am<00:01:22.400> so

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:23.400 
here the two is changed into the am so

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:29.390 
here the two is changed into the am so
200<00:01:23.970> is<00:01:24.860> down<00:01:25.860> by<00:01:27.080> also<00:01:28.080> when<00:01:28.619> there<00:01:28.860> is<00:01:28.979> a<00:01:29.009> zero

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:29.400 
200 is down by also when there is a zero

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:31.359 
200 is down by also when there is a zero
in<00:01:29.579> between<00:01:29.939> the<00:01:30.090> hundreds<00:01:30.540> and<00:01:30.659> ones<00:01:31.020> digit

00:01:31.359 --> 00:01:31.369 
in between the hundreds and ones digit

00:01:31.369 --> 00:01:34.550 
in between the hundreds and ones digit
then<00:01:32.369> you<00:01:32.610> must<00:01:32.640> say<00:01:33.119> the<00:01:33.299> zero<00:01:33.509> I<00:01:33.810> know<00:01:34.320> this

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:34.560 
then you must say the zero I know this

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:36.499 
then you must say the zero I know this
may<00:01:34.740> sound<00:01:34.950> a<00:01:35.070> bit<00:01:35.100> confusing<00:01:35.729> but<00:01:36.150> you'll<00:01:36.329> get

00:01:36.499 --> 00:01:36.509 
may sound a bit confusing but you'll get

00:01:36.509 --> 00:01:40.670 
may sound a bit confusing but you'll get
it<00:01:36.630> in<00:01:36.720> a<00:01:36.840> moment<00:01:38.060> the<00:01:39.060> Chinese<00:01:39.509> word<00:01:40.049> for<00:01:40.079> zero

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:40.680 
it in a moment the Chinese word for zero

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:45.289 
it in a moment the Chinese word for zero
is<00:01:40.979> Ling<00:01:42.560> so<00:01:43.560> therefore<00:01:44.130> following<00:01:44.939> the<00:01:45.060> rules

00:01:45.289 --> 00:01:45.299 
is Ling so therefore following the rules

00:01:45.299 --> 00:01:49.719 
is Ling so therefore following the rules
that<00:01:45.420> I<00:01:45.600> just<00:01:45.780> stated<00:01:46.020> earlier<00:01:47.570> 206<00:01:48.570> should<00:01:49.200> be

00:01:49.719 --> 00:01:49.729 
that I just stated earlier 206 should be

00:01:49.729 --> 00:01:57.410 
that I just stated earlier 206 should be
down<00:01:50.729> by<00:01:51.149> laying<00:01:51.750> lil<00:01:52.850> lam<00:01:53.850> bai<00:01:54.270> ling<00:01:54.960> lil<00:01:56.420> the

00:01:57.410 --> 00:01:57.420 
down by laying lil lam bai ling lil the

00:01:57.420 --> 00:02:00.649 
down by laying lil lam bai ling lil the
final<00:01:57.780> rule<00:01:57.930> is<00:01:58.229> if<00:01:58.700> the<00:01:59.700> number<00:02:00.060> is<00:02:00.090> over<00:02:00.630> a

00:02:00.649 --> 00:02:00.659 
final rule is if the number is over a

00:02:00.659 --> 00:02:04.760 
final rule is if the number is over a
hundred<00:02:01.049> and<00:02:01.259> the<00:02:01.860> tens<00:02:02.280> digit<00:02:02.490> is<00:02:02.939> a<00:02:03.000> one<00:02:03.770> then

00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:04.770 
hundred and the tens digit is a one then

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:10.950 
hundred and the tens digit is a one then
it<00:02:05.130> must<00:02:05.490> be<00:02:05.670> said<00:02:05.939> as<00:02:06.710> issue<00:02:08.209> not<00:02:09.209> just<00:02:09.270> sure

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:10.960 
it must be said as issue not just sure

00:02:10.960 --> 00:02:21.110 
it must be said as issue not just sure
so<00:02:12.690> 911<00:02:13.690> will<00:02:14.200> be<00:02:14.670> Joe<00:02:15.670> by<00:02:15.970> E<00:02:16.270> Sri<00:02:17.610> Joe<00:02:18.610> by<00:02:18.850> yee<00:02:19.420> i

Chinese numbers in the next lesson I

00:03:25.880 --> 00:03:27.880 
Chinese numbers in the next lesson I
will<00:03:25.940> introduce<00:03:26.180> the<00:03:26.420> thousands<00:03:27.320> which

00:03:27.880 --> 00:03:27.890 
will introduce the thousands which

00:03:27.890 --> 00:03:29.980 
will introduce the thousands which
should<00:03:28.100> be<00:03:28.220> much<00:03:28.400> easier<00:03:28.640> after<00:03:29.630> learning<00:03:29.780> the

00:03:29.980 --> 00:03:29.990 
should be much easier after learning the

00:03:29.990 --> 00:03:31.890 
should be much easier after learning the
rules<00:03:30.260> that<00:03:30.560> I<00:03:30.590> introduced<00:03:31.040> in<00:03:31.250> this<00:03:31.460> lesson
