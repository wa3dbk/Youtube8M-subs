 and where it is already there and in general that is 

00:00:10.490 --> 00:00:13.520
 pretty good how it was thought all of this 

00:00:13.520 --> 00:00:15.409
 with the help of such 

00:00:15.409 --> 00:00:16.599

00:00:24.929 --> 00:00:28.369
 failure a lot 

00:00:28.369 --> 00:00:29.919
 In general, the fact that 

00:00:29.919 --> 00:00:32.630
 is free 

00:00:32.630 --> 00:00:35.210
 but 3

 ap 

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:11.210
 Let's go further 

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:14.210
 he 

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:20.170
 in the winter 

00:01:20.170 --> 00:01:21.610
 but 

00:01:21.610 --> 00:01:23.670
 back at the beginning of the war 

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:25.250
 he 

00:01:25.250 --> 00:01:27.600
 m 

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:30.600
 this advertisement 

00:01:32.650 --> 00:01:34.440
 these two channels 

00:01:34.440 --> 00:01:35.310
 separately 

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:37.740
 in experiments in the usual 

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:40.640
 at the end of April 4 

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:43.640
 in principle guys etc 

00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:49.550
 this is some of you 

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:57.880
 ratings that show 

00:01:57.880 --> 00:01:59.330
 as reported 

00:01:59.330 --> 00:02:01.730
 the system is such that 

00:02:01.730 --> 00:02:04.010
 What do you think this look in 

00:02:04.010 --> 00:02:05.700
 reciprocal meeting 

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:07.330
 then in general it will find 

00:02:07.330 --> 00:02:10.309
 and again disaster 

00:02:10.309 --> 00:02:13.049
 Egypt Debility 

00:02:13.049 --> 00:02:14.639

00:02:17.029 --> 00:02:20.029
 Volga Spanish decision 

00:02:21.629 --> 00:02:22.970
 generally 

00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:25.479
 it's all the same 

00:02:25.479 --> 00:02:28.689
 but to man as he is ready, in spite of 

00:02:28.689 --> 00:02:31.689
 even harder to get 

00:02:32.639 --> 00:02:34.269
 that is why 

00:02:34.269 --> 00:02:36.909
 did not work as noted in the fact that I 

00:02:36.909 --> 00:02:40.279
 it is also provided 

00:02:40.279 --> 00:02:42.179
