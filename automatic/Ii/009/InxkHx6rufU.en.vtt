though<00:00:20.720> well<00:00:21.720> sitting<00:00:22.020> it<00:00:22.109> like<00:00:22.289> this<00:00:22.470> you<00:00:23.279> can

00:00:23.420 --> 00:00:23.430 
though well sitting it like this you can

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:25.040 
though well sitting it like this you can
see<00:00:23.640> really<00:00:23.760> exposed<00:00:24.269> welds<00:00:24.720> are<00:00:24.869> pretty

00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:25.050 
see really exposed welds are pretty

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:27.859 
see really exposed welds are pretty
meaty<00:00:25.289> welds<00:00:25.859> and<00:00:26.130> on<00:00:26.970> the<00:00:27.210> back<00:00:27.359> it<00:00:27.570> had<00:00:27.720> this

00:00:27.859 --> 00:00:27.869 
meaty welds and on the back it had this

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:30.230 
meaty welds and on the back it had this
but<00:00:28.080> a<00:00:28.109> folded<00:00:28.500> metal<00:00:28.800> here<00:00:29.010> which<00:00:29.189> i<00:00:29.490> think<00:00:29.910> is

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:30.240 
but a folded metal here which i think is

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:32.330 
but a folded metal here which i think is
a<00:00:30.269> very<00:00:30.420> good<00:00:30.539> way<00:00:30.779> of<00:00:30.890> fixing<00:00:31.890> it<00:00:32.160> because

00:00:32.330 --> 00:00:32.340 
a very good way of fixing it because

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:35.170 
a very good way of fixing it because
you're<00:00:32.430> going<00:00:32.520> to<00:00:32.579> get<00:00:32.759> dirt<00:00:33.030> and<00:00:33.239> crap

00:00:35.170 --> 00:00:35.180 
you're going to get dirt and crap

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:37.340 
you're going to get dirt and crap
filling<00:00:36.180> up<00:00:36.300> and<00:00:36.450> lead<00:00:36.660> and<00:00:36.930> this<00:00:37.079> would<00:00:37.260> we

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:37.350 
filling up and lead and this would we

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:39.350 
filling up and lead and this would we
get<00:00:37.500> that<00:00:37.739> I've<00:00:37.890> left<00:00:38.100> here<00:00:38.460> was<00:00:39.149> just

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:39.360 
get that I've left here was just

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:41.990 
get that I've left here was just
pronounced<00:00:39.780> more<00:00:39.930> rust<00:00:40.200> and<00:00:40.800> you<00:00:41.489> can<00:00:41.640> see<00:00:41.850> the

00:00:41.990 --> 00:00:42.000 
pronounced more rust and you can see the

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:44.569 
pronounced more rust and you can see the
bottom<00:00:42.270> has<00:00:42.510> been<00:00:42.719> doing<00:00:43.020> that<00:00:43.170> and<00:00:43.500> it's<00:00:44.340> just

00:00:44.569 --> 00:00:44.579 
bottom has been doing that and it's just

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:47.240 
bottom has been doing that and it's just
already<00:00:44.820> starting<00:00:45.360> to<00:00:45.390> rust<00:00:45.570> out<00:00:45.860> and<00:00:46.860> it

00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:47.250 
already starting to rust out and it

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:48.680 
already starting to rust out and it
wasn't<00:00:47.399> in<00:00:47.610> a<00:00:47.670> very<00:00:47.700> good<00:00:48.000> state<00:00:48.270> so<00:00:48.539> what<00:00:48.660> I

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:48.690 
wasn't in a very good state so what I

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:52.369 
wasn't in a very good state so what I
did<00:00:48.840> is<00:00:49.289> I<00:00:49.739> cut<00:00:50.039> that<00:00:50.190> out<00:00:50.660> and<00:00:51.660> unpick<00:00:52.199> the

00:00:52.369 --> 00:00:52.379 
did is I cut that out and unpick the

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:55.310 
did is I cut that out and unpick the
bottom<00:00:52.710> of<00:00:52.890> the<00:00:53.670> door<00:00:53.879> skin<00:00:54.149> I'm<00:00:54.390> just<00:00:55.140> trying

00:00:55.310 --> 00:00:55.320 
bottom of the door skin I'm just trying

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:58.490 
bottom of the door skin I'm just trying
to<00:00:55.350> be<00:00:55.469> careful<00:00:55.680> not<00:00:56.039> to<00:00:57.050> warp<00:00:58.050> it<00:00:58.170> out<00:00:58.289> too

00:00:58.490 --> 00:00:58.500 
to be careful not to warp it out too

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:00.410 
to be careful not to warp it out too

sorry smooth it all out make sure it's
some<00:01:03.690> settings<00:01:04.559> flush<00:01:04.860> and<00:01:05.100> flat<00:01:05.159> and<00:01:06.090> I

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:06.390 
some settings flush and flat and I

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:09.740 
some settings flush and flat and I
actually<00:01:06.600> cut<00:01:07.110> the<00:01:07.979> lower<00:01:08.760> parts<00:01:09.299> of<00:01:09.450> this

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:09.750 
actually cut the lower parts of this

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:11.270 
actually cut the lower parts of this
door<00:01:10.020> frame<00:01:10.290> this<00:01:10.530> is<00:01:10.650> one<00:01:10.770> of<00:01:10.830> the<00:01:10.920> front<00:01:11.159> door

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:11.280 
door frame this is one of the front door

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:13.940 
door frame this is one of the front door
frames<00:01:11.640> to<00:01:11.850> use<00:01:12.060> as<00:01:12.450> a<00:01:12.810> peer<00:01:13.500> panel<00:01:13.799> because

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:13.950 
frames to use as a peer panel because

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:15.920 
frames to use as a peer panel because
they're<00:01:14.100> roughly<00:01:14.729> the<00:01:14.850> the<00:01:15.360> right<00:01:15.600> sort<00:01:15.869> of

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:15.930 
they're roughly the the right sort of

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:19.280 
they're roughly the the right sort of
curves<00:01:16.220> for<00:01:17.220> this<00:01:17.340> bottom<00:01:17.640> part<00:01:17.820> exactly<00:01:18.689> all

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:19.290 
curves for this bottom part exactly all

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:21.859 
curves for this bottom part exactly all
do<00:01:19.500> so<00:01:19.920> I<00:01:19.950> could<00:01:20.130> use<00:01:20.430> it<00:01:20.460> to<00:01:20.670> cut<00:01:21.570> out<00:01:21.689> the

00:01:21.859 --> 00:01:21.869 
do so I could use it to cut out the

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:23.510 
do so I could use it to cut out the
center<00:01:22.049> section<00:01:22.380> I'm<00:01:22.979> still<00:01:23.189> going<00:01:23.310> to<00:01:23.369> make

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:23.520 
center section I'm still going to make

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:25.490 
center section I'm still going to make
it<00:01:23.640> better<00:01:23.759> for<00:01:23.939> the<00:01:24.060> rear<00:01:24.330> and<00:01:25.200> for<00:01:25.439> the

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:25.500 
it better for the rear and for the

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:27.050 
it better for the rear and for the
corners<00:01:25.950> these<00:01:26.189> are<00:01:26.369> real<00:01:26.580> pain<00:01:26.820> in<00:01:26.970> the<00:01:27.000> ass

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:27.060 
corners these are real pain in the ass

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:29.990 
corners these are real pain in the ass
cuz<00:01:27.509> they<00:01:27.689> they<00:01:28.320> just<00:01:29.280> tracked<00:01:29.520> moisture<00:01:29.909> on

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:30.000 
cuz they they just tracked moisture on

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:31.700 
cuz they they just tracked moisture on
the<00:01:30.090> corner<00:01:30.390> here<00:01:30.600> and<00:01:30.810> do<00:01:30.960> it<00:01:31.020> and<00:01:31.200> rust<00:01:31.530> out

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:31.710 
the corner here and do it and rust out

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:34.179 
the corner here and do it and rust out
I've<00:01:32.579> actually<00:01:32.790> made<00:01:33.150> out<00:01:33.420> my<00:01:33.750> own<00:01:33.869> piece

00:01:34.179 --> 00:01:34.189 
I've actually made out my own piece

00:01:34.189 --> 00:01:37.010 
I've actually made out my own piece
which<00:01:35.189> is<00:01:35.340> sitting<00:01:35.549> in<00:01:35.670> there<00:01:35.850> just<00:01:36.240> from

00:01:37.010 --> 00:01:37.020 
which is sitting in there just from

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:38.630 
which is sitting in there just from
better<00:01:37.350> meat<00:01:37.560> oh<00:01:37.590> and<00:01:37.950> just<00:01:38.159> stretching<00:01:38.549> the

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:38.640 
better meat oh and just stretching the

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:40.039 
better meat oh and just stretching the
 out<00:01:39.000> of<00:01:39.030> it<00:01:39.210> and<00:01:39.360> I've<00:01:39.450> got<00:01:39.600> a<00:01:39.630> roughly

00:01:40.039 --> 00:01:40.049 
 out of it and I've got a roughly

00:01:40.049 --> 00:01:41.450 
 out of it and I've got a roughly
were<00:01:40.200> a<00:01:40.229> nice<00:01:40.439> fair<00:01:40.680> need<00:01:40.950> a<00:01:40.979> little<00:01:41.189> bit<00:01:41.340> of

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:41.460 
were a nice fair need a little bit of

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:45.380 
were a nice fair need a little bit of
more<00:01:41.790> planishing<00:01:43.100> but<00:01:44.100> they'd<00:01:44.250> set<00:01:44.549> I<00:01:44.790> could

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:45.390 
more planishing but they'd set I could

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:48.469

probably<00:02:53.819> be<00:02:54.030> the<00:02:54.060> front<00:02:54.360> guards<00:02:54.720> and<00:02:55.500> on<00:02:55.650> each

00:02:55.820 --> 00:02:55.830 
probably be the front guards and on each

00:02:55.830 --> 00:02:58.339 
probably be the front guards and on each
step<00:02:56.040> to<00:02:56.160> do<00:02:56.280> it<00:02:56.370> but<00:02:56.459> a<00:02:56.489> rowdy<00:02:56.850> so<00:02:57.239> yeah<00:02:57.810> it's

00:02:58.339 --> 00:02:58.349 
step to do it but a rowdy so yeah it's

00:02:58.349 --> 00:03:01.610 
step to do it but a rowdy so yeah it's
for<00:02:58.530> at<00:02:58.709> the<00:02:58.830> moment<00:02:58.860> there
