00:00:00.620 --> 00:00:04.329 

let's<00:00:01.620> convert<00:00:01.979> a<00:00:02.280> decimal<00:00:02.669> number<00:00:02.970> to<00:00:03.540> binary

00:00:04.329 --> 00:00:04.339 
let's convert a decimal number to binary

00:00:04.339 --> 00:00:08.890 
let's convert a decimal number to binary
let's<00:00:05.339> start<00:00:05.580> off<00:00:05.759> with<00:00:05.790> the<00:00:06.299> decimal<00:00:06.750> number

00:00:08.890 --> 00:00:08.900 
let's start off with the decimal number

00:00:08.900 --> 00:00:13.459 
let's start off with the decimal number
15<00:00:10.309> and<00:00:11.309> I<00:00:12.000> want<00:00:12.179> to<00:00:12.240> convert<00:00:12.540> it<00:00:12.690> to<00:00:12.929> a<00:00:13.110> binary

00:00:13.459 --> 00:00:13.469 
15 and I want to convert it to a binary

00:00:13.469 --> 00:00:16.010 
15 and I want to convert it to a binary
number<00:00:13.880> there's<00:00:14.880> a<00:00:15.000> method<00:00:15.450> called<00:00:15.480> the

00:00:16.010 --> 00:00:16.020 
number there's a method called the

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:19.070 
number there's a method called the
divided<00:00:16.710> by<00:00:17.039> two<00:00:17.100> method<00:00:17.760> and<00:00:18.449> this<00:00:18.539> is<00:00:18.750> on

00:00:19.070 --> 00:00:19.080 
divided by two method and this is on

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:23.599 
divided by two method and this is on
page<00:00:19.109> eight<00:00:19.619> in<00:00:19.920> your<00:00:19.949> book<00:00:20.279> if<00:00:20.880> we<00:00:21.539> use<00:00:22.609> the

00:00:23.599 --> 00:00:23.609 
page eight in your book if we use the

00:00:23.609 --> 00:00:26.210 
page eight in your book if we use the
divided<00:00:24.300> by<00:00:24.510> 2<00:00:24.570> method<00:00:25.140> I<00:00:25.289> would<00:00:25.769> start<00:00:26.099> off

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:26.220 
divided by 2 method I would start off

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:29.120 
divided by 2 method I would start off
with<00:00:26.369> the<00:00:26.490> number<00:00:26.960> 15<00:00:27.960> and<00:00:28.260> then<00:00:28.830> I<00:00:28.949> would

00:00:29.120 --> 00:00:29.130 
with the number 15 and then I would

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:32.269 
with the number 15 and then I would
divide<00:00:29.429> it<00:00:29.640> by<00:00:29.760> 2<00:00:30.170> now<00:00:31.170> you<00:00:31.230> know<00:00:31.529> that<00:00:31.740> 15

00:00:32.269 --> 00:00:32.279 
divide it by 2 now you know that 15

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:36.260 
divide it by 2 now you know that 15
divided<00:00:32.640> by<00:00:32.669> 2<00:00:32.759> is<00:00:33.239> equal<00:00:34.200> to<00:00:34.230> 7<00:00:34.850> 7<00:00:35.850> times<00:00:36.000> 2<00:00:36.239> is

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:36.270 
divided by 2 is equal to 7 7 times 2 is

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:40.790 
divided by 2 is equal to 7 7 times 2 is
14<00:00:36.390> so<00:00:37.320> we've<00:00:37.469> got<00:00:37.620> a<00:00:37.649> remainder<00:00:38.040> of<00:00:38.420> 1<00:00:39.680> then<00:00:40.680> I

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:40.800 
14 so we've got a remainder of 1 then I

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:47.290 
14 so we've got a remainder of 1 then I
would<00:00:40.950> go<00:00:41.100> 7<00:00:41.660> divided<00:00:42.660> by<00:00:42.690> 2<00:00:44.300> 7<00:00:45.300> divided<00:00:45.809> by<00:00:45.930> 2

00:00:47.290 --> 00:00:47.300 
would go 7 divided by 2 7 divided by 2

00:00:47.300 --> 00:00:53.119 
would go 7 divided by 2 7 divided by 2
is<00:00:48.300> 3<00:00:49.520> 3<00:00:50.520> times<00:00:50.730> 2<00:00:50.940> is<00:00:50.969> 6<00:00:51.120> 7<00:00:52.020> minus<00:00:52.379> 6<00:00:52.500> is<00:00:52.649> 1<00:00:52.710> so

00:00:53.119 --> 00:00:53.129 
is 3 3 times 2 is 6 7 minus 6 is 1 so

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:55.000 
is 3 3 times 2 is 6 7 minus 6 is 1 so
we're<00:00:53.250> very<00:00:53.280> main<00:00:53.760> Derr<00:00:53.910> once<00:00:54.120> again<00:00:54.420> at<00:00:54.539> 1

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:55.010 
we're very main Derr once again at 1

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:58.490 
we're very main Derr once again at 1
then<00:00:56.010> I<00:00:56.190> go<00:00:56.399> 3<00:00:56.699> divided<00:00:57.090> by<00:00:57.120> 2<00:00:57.239> so<00:00:58.230> we're<00:00:58.350> going

00:00:58.490 --> 00:00:58.500 
then I go 3 divided by 2 so we're going

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:01.459 
then I go 3 divided by 2 so we're going
to<00:00:58.590> 3<00:00:58.890> one<00:00:59.399> time<00:00:59.670> and<00:01:00.320> that'll<00:01:01.320> have<00:01:01.440> a

00:01:01.459 --> 00:01:01.469 
to 3 one time and that'll have a

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:05.170 
to 3 one time and that'll have a
remainder<00:01:01.859> of<00:01:02.010> 1<00:01:02.660> and<00:01:03.660> when<00:01:03.840> we<00:01:03.960> get<00:01:04.080> to<00:01:04.140> the

00:01:05.170 --> 00:01:05.180 
remainder of 1 and when we get to the

00:01:05.180 --> 00:01:09.950 
remainder of 1 and when we get to the
1/2<00:01:06.650> you<00:01:07.650> see<00:01:07.920> 2<00:01:08.520> will<00:01:08.700> go<00:01:08.880> into<00:01:09.000> one<00:01:09.240> so<00:01:09.810> we

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:09.960 
1/2 you see 2 will go into one so we

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:14.000 
1/2 you see 2 will go into one so we
have<00:01:10.140> that<00:01:10.320> remaining<00:01:10.950> one<00:01:11.159> left<00:01:11.430> over<00:01:13.010> now

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:14.010 
have that remaining one left over now

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:16.670 
have that remaining one left over now
this<00:01:14.280> will<00:01:14.490> be<00:01:14.610> my<00:01:14.820> least<00:01:15.530> significant<00:01:16.530> bit

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:16.680 
this will be my least significant bit

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:19.460 
this will be my least significant bit
this<00:01:17.490> will<00:01:17.700> be<00:01:17.880> my<00:01:18.060> most<00:01:18.299> significant<00:01:19.290> bit

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:19.470 
this will be my most significant bit

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:21.740 
this will be my most significant bit
which<00:01:20.159> means<00:01:20.400> I<00:01:20.700> would<00:01:20.759> start<00:01:21.119> riding<00:01:21.360> with<00:01:21.600> my

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:21.750 
which means I would start riding with my

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:24.890 
which means I would start riding with my
most<00:01:21.990> significant<00:01:22.500> bit<00:01:22.860> 1<00:01:23.220> and<00:01:24.090> then<00:01:24.360> we<00:01:24.479> got<00:01:24.630> 1

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:24.900 
most significant bit 1 and then we got 1

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:32.260 
most significant bit 1 and then we got 1
1<00:01:25.200> 1<00:01:26.189> so<00:01:26.930> the<00:01:27.930> decimal<00:01:28.320> number<00:01:28.350> 15<00:01:29.250> is<00:01:29.659> 1<00:01:30.659> 1<00:01:31.170> 1<00:01:31.680> 1

00:01:32.260 --> 00:01:32.270 
1 1 so the decimal number 15 is 1 1 1 1

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:39.310 
1 1 so the decimal number 15 is 1 1 1 1
in<00:01:33.270> binary<00:01:34.369> let's<00:01:35.369> take<00:01:35.610> the<00:01:35.729> number<00:01:38.060> 18

00:01:39.310 --> 00:01:39.320 
in binary let's take the number 18

00:01:39.320 --> 00:01:42.080 
in binary let's take the number 18
decimal<00:01:40.320> and<00:01:40.979> we<00:01:41.070> want<00:01:41.250> to<00:01:41.310> convert<00:01:41.579> this<00:01:41.640> to

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:42.090 
decimal and we want to convert this to

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:45.530 
decimal and we want to convert this to
binary<00:01:42.470> we'll<00:01:43.470> start<00:01:43.770> off<00:01:43.920> with<00:01:43.979> 18<00:01:44.640> divided

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:45.540 
binary we'll start off with 18 divided

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:50.990 
binary we'll start off with 18 divided
by<00:01:45.570> 2<00:01:45.720> is<00:01:46.579> 9<00:01:47.579> 9<00:01:48.119> times<00:01:48.479> 2<00:01:48.689> is<00:01:48.720> 18<00:01:50.000> therefore

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:51.000 
by 2 is 9 9 times 2 is 18 therefore

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:55.190 
by 2 is 9 9 times 2 is 18 therefore
there<00:01:51.509> is<00:01:51.689> no<00:01:51.840> remainder<00:01:52.640> 90<00:01:53.640> by<00:01:53.759> 2<00:01:53.820> by<00:01:54.060> 2<00:01:54.200> is

00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:55.200 
there is no remainder 90 by 2 by 2 is

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:58.270 
there is no remainder 90 by 2 by 2 is
equal<00:01:55.409> to<00:01:55.590> 4<00:01:55.860> 4<00:01:56.280> times<00:01:56.520> 2<00:01:56.670> is<00:01:56.700> 8<00:01:56.820> 9<00:01:57.540> minus<00:01:57.899> 8<00:01:58.079> is<00:01:58.110> 1

00:01:58.270 --> 00:01:58.280 
equal to 4 4 times 2 is 8 9 minus 8 is 1

00:01:58.280 --> 00:02:03.249 
equal to 4 4 times 2 is 8 9 minus 8 is 1
so<00:01:59.280> we<00:01:59.430> have<00:01:59.579> a<00:01:59.610> remainder<00:02:00.680> 4<00:02:01.680> divided<00:02:02.159> by<00:02:02.189> 2

00:02:03.249 --> 00:02:03.259 
so we have a remainder 4 divided by 2

00:02:03.259 --> 00:02:08.630 
so we have a remainder 4 divided by 2
equals<00:02:04.259> 2<00:02:05.600> 2<00:02:06.600> times<00:02:06.869> 2<00:02:06.990> is<00:02:07.020> 4<00:02:07.170> so<00:02:07.680> there<00:02:08.039> is<00:02:08.310> no

00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:08.640 
equals 2 2 times 2 is 4 so there is no

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:10.169 
equals 2 2 times 2 is 4 so there is no
remainder

00:02:10.169 --> 00:02:10.179 
remainder

00:02:10.179 --> 00:02:14.130 
remainder
two<00:02:10.509> divided<00:02:10.899> by<00:02:11.049> two<00:02:11.140> is<00:02:11.680> one<00:02:11.859> one<00:02:12.989> times<00:02:13.989> two

00:02:14.130 --> 00:02:14.140 
two divided by two is one one times two

00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:14.580 
two divided by two is one one times two
is<00:02:14.170> two

00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:14.590 
is two

00:02:14.590 --> 00:02:18.030 
is two
so<00:02:15.310> there<00:02:15.519> isn't<00:02:15.700> a<00:02:15.909> remainder<00:02:16.450> and<00:02:16.599> then<00:02:17.230> 1/2

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:18.040 
so there isn't a remainder and then 1/2

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:21.630 
so there isn't a remainder and then 1/2
we<00:02:18.879> can't<00:02:19.180> do<00:02:19.420> that<00:02:19.829> so<00:02:20.829> we<00:02:20.980> have<00:02:21.189> a<00:02:21.219> remainder

00:02:21.630 --> 00:02:21.640 
we can't do that so we have a remainder

00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:24.470 
we can't do that so we have a remainder
of<00:02:21.849> 1<00:02:22.620> remember<00:02:23.620> this<00:02:23.739> is<00:02:23.920> my<00:02:23.950> least

00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:24.480 
of 1 remember this is my least

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:27.890 
of 1 remember this is my least
significant<00:02:25.480> bit<00:02:25.689> this<00:02:26.620> would<00:02:26.889> be<00:02:27.040> my<00:02:27.219> most

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:27.900 
significant bit this would be my most

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:30.690 
significant bit this would be my most
significant<00:02:28.900> bit<00:02:29.049> so<00:02:30.010> starting<00:02:30.459> with<00:02:30.519> my

00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:30.700

00:02:30.700 --> 00:02:31.800 
significant bit so starting with my
motherfucka<00:02:31.299> bit
