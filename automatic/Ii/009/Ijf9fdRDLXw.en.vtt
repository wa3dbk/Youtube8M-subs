back here in the motion pro workshop

00:00:12.350 --> 00:00:15.070 
back here in the motion pro workshop
we're<00:00:12.740> gonna<00:00:12.950> do<00:00:13.309> a<00:00:13.670> little<00:00:14.120> demonstration<00:00:14.510> on

00:00:15.070 --> 00:00:15.080 
we're gonna do a little demonstration on

00:00:15.080 --> 00:00:17.620 
we're gonna do a little demonstration on

the motion pro chain alignment tool
which<00:00:18.410> is<00:00:18.680> a<00:00:19.570> longtime<00:00:20.570> tool<00:00:20.930> in<00:00:21.109> our<00:00:21.199> catalog

00:00:21.700 --> 00:00:21.710 
which is a longtime tool in our catalog

00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:23.350 
which is a longtime tool in our catalog
it's<00:00:21.949> very<00:00:22.160> handy<00:00:22.580> a<00:00:22.609> little<00:00:22.880> piece<00:00:23.060> to<00:00:23.240> have

00:00:23.350 --> 00:00:23.360 
it's very handy a little piece to have

00:00:23.360 --> 00:00:24.400 
it's very handy a little piece to have
in<00:00:23.420> your<00:00:23.630> toolbox

00:00:24.400 --> 00:00:24.410 
in your toolbox

00:00:24.410 --> 00:00:26.980 
in your toolbox
and<00:00:24.530> so<00:00:24.920> we<00:00:25.010> wanted<00:00:25.250> to<00:00:25.310> go<00:00:25.460> over<00:00:25.760> the<00:00:26.119> use<00:00:26.750> of

00:00:26.980 --> 00:00:26.990 
and so we wanted to go over the use of

00:00:26.990 --> 00:00:28.450 
and so we wanted to go over the use of
the<00:00:27.050> tool<00:00:27.289> so<00:00:27.320> that<00:00:27.650> ever<00:00:27.770> I<00:00:27.830> can<00:00:28.039> get<00:00:28.190> a<00:00:28.220> really

00:00:28.450 --> 00:00:28.460 
the tool so that ever I can get a really

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:30.880 
the tool so that ever I can get a really
good<00:00:28.580> idea<00:00:28.640> of<00:00:28.970> what<00:00:29.180> it's<00:00:29.300> all<00:00:29.480> about<00:00:29.830> by<00:00:30.830> the

00:00:30.880 --> 00:00:30.890 
good idea of what it's all about by the

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:33.069 
good idea of what it's all about by the
way<00:00:31.039> if<00:00:31.760> you<00:00:31.880> like<00:00:31.970> my<00:00:32.119> new<00:00:32.270> shirt<00:00:32.449> got<00:00:32.930> a<00:00:32.960> new

that will mount the chain alignment tool

00:01:15.110 --> 00:01:18.120 
that will mount the chain alignment tool
to<00:01:15.979> the<00:01:16.780> sprocket

00:01:18.120 --> 00:01:18.130 
to the sprocket

00:01:18.130 --> 00:01:24.730 
to the sprocket
once<00:01:19.130> you<00:01:19.310> have<00:01:22.810> the<00:01:23.810> tool<00:01:24.049> clamped<00:01:24.470> on<00:01:24.590> the

00:01:24.730 --> 00:01:24.740 
once you have the tool clamped on the

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:26.950 
once you have the tool clamped on the
sprocket<00:01:25.010> by<00:01:25.729> looking<00:01:26.150> at<00:01:26.270> the<00:01:26.390> back<00:01:26.600> of<00:01:26.630> the

00:01:26.950 --> 00:01:26.960 
sprocket by looking at the back of the

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:31.570 
sprocket by looking at the back of the
chain<00:01:27.260> you<00:01:27.890> can<00:01:28.070> tell<00:01:28.369> whether<00:01:29.260> the<00:01:30.580> rear

00:01:31.570 --> 00:01:31.580 
chain you can tell whether the rear

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:35.289 
chain you can tell whether the rear
sprocket<00:01:32.180> is<00:01:33.189> parallel<00:01:34.189> work<00:01:34.610> actually<00:01:35.180> in

00:01:35.289 --> 00:01:35.299 
sprocket is parallel work actually in

00:01:35.299 --> 00:01:38.109 
sprocket is parallel work actually in
this<00:01:35.420> case<00:01:35.479> perpendicular<00:01:36.439> to<00:01:36.680> the<00:01:37.220> chain<00:01:37.490> if

00:01:38.109 --> 00:01:38.119 
this case perpendicular to the chain if

00:01:38.119 --> 00:01:41.410 
this case perpendicular to the chain if
if<00:01:38.869> the<00:01:39.290> rod<00:01:39.770> is<00:01:40.009> pointing<00:01:40.430> to<00:01:40.580> one<00:01:40.820> direction

00:01:41.410 --> 00:01:41.420 
if the rod is pointing to one direction

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:43.539 
if the rod is pointing to one direction
or<00:01:41.689> the<00:01:41.780> other<00:01:41.960> you<00:01:42.799> know<00:01:42.950> that<00:01:43.130> you<00:01:43.250> have<00:01:43.400> to

00:01:43.539 --> 00:01:43.549 
or the other you know that you have to

00:01:43.549 --> 00:01:46.749 
or the other you know that you have to
make<00:01:43.700> adjustments<00:01:44.450> in<00:01:44.930> your<00:01:45.439> swing<00:01:46.159> arm<00:01:46.369> axle

00:01:46.749 --> 00:01:46.759 
make adjustments in your swing arm axle

00:01:46.759 --> 00:01:49.780 
make adjustments in your swing arm axle
adjustments<00:01:47.420> to<00:01:48.110> realign<00:01:48.890> the<00:01:49.100> sprocket<00:01:49.579> to

00:01:49.780 --> 00:01:49.790 
adjustments to realign the sprocket to

00:01:49.790 --> 00:01:52.929 
adjustments to realign the sprocket to
the<00:01:49.880> chain<00:01:50.180> and<00:01:50.450> therefore<00:01:51.490> also<00:01:52.490> this<00:01:52.729> also

00:01:52.929 --> 00:01:52.939 
the chain and therefore also this also

00:01:52.939 --> 00:01:55.530 
the chain and therefore also this also
works<00:01:53.270> for<00:01:53.540> wheel<00:01:53.900> alignment<00:01:54.380> as<00:01:54.500> well<00:01:54.530> so

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:55.540 
works for wheel alignment as well so

00:01:55.540 --> 00:01:58.450 
works for wheel alignment as well so
when<00:01:56.540> we're<00:01:56.720> looking<00:01:57.020> at<00:01:57.140> this<00:01:57.320> one<00:01:57.590> we<00:01:58.189> see

00:01:58.450 --> 00:01:58.460 
when we're looking at this one we see

00:01:58.460 --> 00:02:01.600 
when we're looking at this one we see
that<00:01:58.820> it's<00:01:59.150> pointing<00:01:59.750> towards<00:02:00.380> the<00:02:01.100> inside<00:02:01.549> of

00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:01.610 
that it's pointing towards the inside of

00:02:01.610 --> 00:02:03.700 
that it's pointing towards the inside of
the<00:02:01.880> wheel<00:02:02.060> so<00:02:02.390> I<00:02:02.420> know<00:02:02.630> that<00:02:03.170> I<00:02:03.350> need<00:02:03.680> to

00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:03.710 
the wheel so I know that I need to

00:02:03.710 --> 00:02:06.999 
the wheel so I know that I need to
either<00:02:04.040> move<00:02:04.729> this<00:02:05.119> axle<00:02:05.600> outwards<00:02:06.049> this<00:02:06.770> side

00:02:06.999 --> 00:02:07.009 
either move this axle outwards this side

00:02:07.009 --> 00:02:09.729 
either move this axle outwards this side
of<00:02:07.130> the<00:02:07.189> axle<00:02:07.549> outwards<00:02:07.970> or<00:02:08.259> this<00:02:09.259> side<00:02:09.500> of<00:02:09.649> the

00:02:09.729 --> 00:02:09.739 
of the axle outwards or this side of the

00:02:09.739 --> 00:02:14.140 
of the axle outwards or this side of the
axle<00:02:10.159> inwards

00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:14.150 

00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:18.319 

so<00:02:15.150> now<00:02:15.299> that<00:02:15.360> we<00:02:15.629> know<00:02:15.659> where<00:02:16.819> the<00:02:17.819> alignment

00:02:18.319 --> 00:02:18.329 
so now that we know where the alignment

00:02:18.329 --> 00:02:20.539 
so now that we know where the alignment
is<00:02:18.480> we<00:02:19.110> can<00:02:19.290> now<00:02:19.439> come<00:02:19.680> over<00:02:19.709> onto<00:02:20.159> this<00:02:20.280> side

00:02:20.539 --> 00:02:20.549 
is we can now come over onto this side

00:02:20.549 --> 00:02:22.819 
is we can now come over onto this side
of<00:02:20.640> the<00:02:20.730> bike<00:02:20.909> and<00:02:21.180> we're<00:02:22.170> going<00:02:22.379> to<00:02:22.439> make<00:02:22.650> an

00:02:22.819 --> 00:02:22.829 
of the bike and we're going to make an

00:02:22.829 --> 00:02:26.830 
of the bike and we're going to make an
adjustment<00:02:22.950> to<00:02:23.549> the<00:02:24.920> rear<00:02:25.920> axle<00:02:26.189> position

00:03:33.740 --> 00:03:33.750 
intention on things to have the wheel

00:03:33.750 --> 00:03:38.119 
intention on things to have the wheel
not<00:03:34.530> fully<00:03:35.430> pressed<00:03:36.359> up<00:03:36.599> against<00:03:37.169> the<00:03:37.260> axle

not fully pressed up against the axle
adjuster<00:03:38.549> stops<00:03:38.940> if<00:03:39.359> you<00:03:40.199> don't<00:03:40.379> do<00:03:40.530> that<00:03:40.650> the

00:03:40.879 --> 00:03:40.889 
adjuster stops if you don't do that the

00:03:40.889 --> 00:03:42.289 
adjuster stops if you don't do that the
wheel<00:03:41.040> can<00:03:41.250> be<00:03:41.310> out<00:03:41.519> of<00:03:41.549> alignment<00:03:41.760> and<00:03:42.209> all

00:03:42.289 --> 00:03:42.299 
wheel can be out of alignment and all

00:03:42.299 --> 00:03:44.000 
wheel can be out of alignment and all
the<00:03:42.389> work<00:03:42.540> that<00:03:42.569> we<00:03:42.810> just<00:03:43.049> did<00:03:43.260> is<00:03:43.500> really<00:03:43.709> for

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:44.010 
the work that we just did is really for

00:03:44.010 --> 00:03:46.400 
the work that we just did is really for
nothing<00:03:44.340> so<00:03:44.940> there's<00:03:45.030> a<00:03:45.180> little<00:03:45.269> trick<00:03:45.510> that

00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:46.410 
nothing so there's a little trick that

00:03:46.410 --> 00:03:48.770 
nothing so there's a little trick that
is<00:03:46.769> pretty<00:03:47.069> cool<00:03:47.340> so<00:03:47.940> if<00:03:48.090> you<00:03:48.209> take<00:03:48.389> an<00:03:48.599> old

00:03:48.770 --> 00:03:48.780 
is pretty cool so if you take an old

00:03:48.780 --> 00:03:51.020 
is pretty cool so if you take an old
screwdriver<00:03:49.190> something<00:03:50.190> or<00:03:50.430> something
