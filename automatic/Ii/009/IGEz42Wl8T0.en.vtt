00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:39.130
 hello to everyone who joins us 

00:00:37.210 --> 00:00:42.040
 I am still at microsoft 's 

00:00:39.130 --> 00:00:44.950
 always in the presence of a new lumia 

00:00:42.040 --> 00:00:46.840
 which is advertised it is the lumia 640 x 

00:00:44.950 --> 00:00:48.370
 l so why excel and well you 

00:00:46.840 --> 00:00:51.550
 saw the little lighthouse just now 

00:00:48.370 --> 00:00:53.320
 knock the lumia 640 and there we have the version 

00:00:51.550 --> 00:00:57.380
 a little fable is I want to say of 

00:00:53.320 --> 00:00:59.030
 those of that lumia mine is fine 

00:00:57.380 --> 00:01:00.590
 I have a life plus our cages even though I have 

00:00:59.030 --> 00:01:02.240
 almost fooled me into presenting this 

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:04.460
 video but now we have a brand 

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:06.230
 brand and microsoft obviously since 

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:08.660
 nokia is no longer part of microsoft 

00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:11.000
 as a reminder so at all here we have a 

00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:12.409
 smartphone to find the mark 

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:14.509
 microsoft 

00:01:12.409 --> 00:01:16.880
 Moreover slowly and well 

00:01:14.509 --> 00:01:19.330
 nokia brand will disappear we will 

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:21.760
 make way for 

00:01:19.330 --> 00:01:23.950
 sound brandet microsoft we will even have 

00:01:21.760 --> 00:01:26.590
 a flagship for the moment he did not 

00:01:23.950 --> 00:01:28.000
 been announced when the ear but one 

00:01:26.590 --> 00:01:30.280
 imagine very well that for the launch 

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:32.050
 of windows 10 on smartphone finally the 

00:01:30.280 --> 00:01:33.910
 launch of windows iis all is short 

00:01:32.050 --> 00:01:35.640
 well or benefit will benefit forgiveness 

00:01:33.910 --> 00:01:39.030
 of 

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:41.820
 yahia flagship for for launch this 

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:43.830
 lumia 640 x she stands out and well 

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:45.630
 obviously by this big screen since we 

00:01:43.830 --> 00:01:47.760
 going to have a 5.7-inch pond that 

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:50.610
 offers a hd resolution be a density 

00:01:47.760 --> 00:01:51.990
 of pixels of 259 that country then the 

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:54.570
 pixel density is lower 

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:56.520
 obviously only on the 640 model since 

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:57.720
 the size of the points there but she has 

00:01:56.520 --> 00:02:00.000
 the size of the biggest points 

00:01:57.720 --> 00:02:01.590
 sorry but the resolution is the same one 

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:03.750
 will always find the body and the 

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:05.100
 class iii concerning its dimensions on 

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:06.990
 is going to have a lot more smartphone 

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:11.009
 great since we will have a smartphone 

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:13.200
 which makes 157 9 mm 2 opp 81 25 mm of 

00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:16.470
 wide and a little thicker since that 

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:18.060
 it is 9 mm about its weight 

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:20.390
 obviously we are on things a little bit 

00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:22.460
 longer we are on a weight of 171 

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:25.220
 but for the internal components and 

00:02:22.460 --> 00:02:26.090
 well found almost the same thing as 

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:28.040
 his little brother 

00:02:26.090 --> 00:02:29.900
 you will benefit from a stadium 

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:32.600
 darragon 400 clocked waves of 

00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:34.930
 gigahertz 1 giga of ram 8 gigas of 

00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:36.610
 internal storage we will also have 

00:02:34.930 --> 00:02:38.620
 giga 

00:02:36.610 --> 00:02:41.350
 a drive so the one drive is all 

00:02:38.620 --> 00:02:42.910
 just the pl2 of microsoft you 

00:02:41.350 --> 00:02:44.920
 you will be able to benefit from 30 giga 

00:02:42.910 --> 00:02:47.050
 Another 30 billion and we're going 

00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:50.050
 find also a micro port sd 

00:02:47.050 --> 00:02:52.610
 up to 128 giga his battery is 

00:02:50.050 --> 00:02:54.560
 obviously more rosy since 

00:02:52.610 --> 00:02:56.180
 which says of an effort to demand more 

00:02:54.560 --> 00:02:58.520
 of energy of the blow it is difficult a 

00:02:56.180 --> 00:03:00.540
 3000 million battery loses for the 

00:02:58.520 --> 00:03:03.719
 moment obviously I can not too much 

00:03:00.540 --> 00:03:06.780
 do ahead of the autonomy of this 

00:03:03.719 --> 00:03:09.800
 smartphone but in any case we will 

00:03:06.780 --> 00:03:11.180
 can still benefit and well 

00:03:09.800 --> 00:03:12.620
 a battery that would allow for at least 

00:03:11.180 --> 00:03:15.460
 of Arabs to hold for me a day 

00:03:12.620 --> 00:03:17.440
 with on smartphones 

00:03:15.460 --> 00:03:18.490
 where he stands out and well from his 

00:03:17.440 --> 00:03:21.160
 little bit it'll be in the game 

00:03:18.490 --> 00:03:22.390
 cameras since at the back here like 

00:03:21.160 --> 00:03:23.710
 you see it if you have the mention at 

00:03:22.390 --> 00:03:26.140
 is it then we will find an optical 

00:03:23.710 --> 00:03:29.050
 carl zeiss is a potting soil 13 

00:03:26.140 --> 00:03:30.890
 megapixels with autofocus and frontal 

00:03:29.050 --> 00:03:33.010
 we are not going to have a 

00:03:30.890 --> 00:03:37.400
 a simple 2 megapixel front camera 

00:03:33.010 --> 00:03:38.870
 a 5 megapixel front camera so 

00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:40.910
 it's going to be for all lovers of 

00:03:38.870 --> 00:03:43.370
 this girl and everything they do 

00:03:40.910 --> 00:03:44.480
 how much of the skype in video and well 

00:03:43.370 --> 00:03:46.760
 you will be able to benefit from a 

00:03:44.480 --> 00:03:48.860
 best camera on this model there she 

00:03:46.760 --> 00:03:49.890
 films in 1080p so we have 

00:03:48.860 --> 00:03:52.610
 really 

00:03:49.890 --> 00:03:52.610
 but that to owl 

00:03:52.880 --> 00:03:57.110
 besides this this part about 

00:03:54.980 --> 00:03:58.790
 connectivity we will see nfc we will 

00:03:57.110 --> 00:04:01.640
 find swimming pools of course 

00:03:58.790 --> 00:04:03.380
 4g simple double sim since you go 

00:04:01.640 --> 00:04:05.120
 can actually insert two sim cards 

00:04:03.380 --> 00:04:06.710
 thanks to smartphones for all 

00:04:05.120 --> 00:04:08.120
 professionals who usually have two 

00:04:06.710 --> 00:04:10.690
 cards folder but well this model is going 

00:04:08.120 --> 00:04:12.130
 be extremely practical 

00:04:10.690 --> 00:04:14.140
 little tour of the owner on the 

00:04:12.130 --> 00:04:16.870
 slice and finally slice lower here 

00:04:14.140 --> 00:04:17.950
 we find the micro usb port on the 

00:04:16.870 --> 00:04:19.989
 left side we have a slice 

00:04:17.950 --> 00:04:23.620
 completely smooth on the top here 

00:04:19.989 --> 00:04:25.150
 so you find the jack 3.5 and 

00:04:23.620 --> 00:04:26.530
 on the right side of the smartphone you 

00:04:25.150 --> 00:04:28.510
 have the power button and the volume button 

00:04:26.530 --> 00:04:30.190
 like his little brother you will be able 

00:04:28.510 --> 00:04:34.420
 remove the hull very simply it 

00:04:30.190 --> 00:04:36.190
 just slip your fingernail this is the 

00:04:34.420 --> 00:04:37.990
 side is retiring instantly you're going 

00:04:36.190 --> 00:04:40.390
 find here so this battery of 

00:04:37.990 --> 00:04:42.550
 3000 millan father are you going to have the 

00:04:40.390 --> 00:04:43.990
 first sim card port here the second 

00:04:42.550 --> 00:04:45.340
 body sim card here so you go 

00:04:43.990 --> 00:04:47.650
 to be able to put 2 we are really on 

00:04:45.340 --> 00:04:51.670
 complete sim cards one is not sure 

00:04:47.650 --> 00:04:56.020
 of the micro and the nano you are going to have the 

00:04:51.670 --> 00:04:57.790
 the card for micro sd on this on this 

00:04:56.020 --> 00:04:59.080
 plan there it will allow you and well 

00:04:57.790 --> 00:05:02.710
 to increase the storage capacity 

00:04:59.080 --> 00:05:06.100
 just by cons 228 giga to say of 

00:05:02.710 --> 00:05:07.480
 more and well this smartphone is found 

00:05:06.100 --> 00:05:09.280
 with windows phone 

00:05:07.480 --> 00:05:10.689
 so for the moment we are sure of 8.2 

00:05:09.280 --> 00:05:12.969
 that is 28.1 

00:05:10.689 --> 00:05:15.580
 obviously he will be eligible for windows 

00:05:12.969 --> 00:05:17.349
 10 as soon as it is available for 

00:05:15.580 --> 00:05:19.419
 the moment you find an ecosystem 

00:05:17.349 --> 00:05:20.889
 who want to say standard that you 

00:05:19.419 --> 00:05:22.989
 are used to using if you have 

00:05:20.889 --> 00:05:24.879
 already had a windows phone smartphone 

00:05:22.989 --> 00:05:27.849
 we will find cortana who is 

00:05:24.879 --> 00:05:29.889
 the digital assistant of microsoft for 

00:05:27.849 --> 00:05:31.380
 the moment still tana is quite powerful 

00:05:29.889 --> 00:05:34.740
 at the level 

00:05:31.380 --> 00:05:36.810
 and well off the Atlantic side of 

00:05:34.740 --> 00:05:38.580
 our english american friends obviously 

00:05:36.810 --> 00:05:40.620
 in France it's a little less the case 

00:05:38.580 --> 00:05:42.419
 services are going more and more 

00:05:40.620 --> 00:05:46.009
 obviously develop the big push that 

00:05:42.419 --> 00:05:47.210
 it's going to be when windows has to come out 

00:05:46.009 --> 00:05:50.119
 last little thing I can you 

00:05:47.210 --> 00:05:52.520
 say for this lumia 640 pixels that's 

00:05:50.119 --> 00:05:56.180
 obviously its price it is available at 

00:05:52.520 --> 00:05:57.919
 price of 249 euros so we are wide a 

00:05:56.180 --> 00:05:59.930
 little bit more expensive actually not 

00:05:57.919 --> 00:06:03.169
 deservedly little bit more expensive than the 

00:05:59.930 --> 00:06:09.469
 smaller model of 50 euros to be 

00:06:03.169 --> 00:06:13.339
 no no I do not know how to count and at 249 and 

00:06:09.469 --> 00:06:14.860
 other ideas at 179 points 1.70 euros 

00:06:13.339 --> 00:06:17.149
 of difference 

00:06:14.860 --> 00:06:19.449
 so you will be able to benefit so 

00:06:17.149 --> 00:06:22.200
 to a smartphone a little bigger 

00:06:19.449 --> 00:06:24.510
 better optics 

00:06:22.200 --> 00:06:25.870
 best camera you are going to have a 

00:06:24.510 --> 00:06:27.070
 closing experience 

00:06:25.870 --> 00:06:28.510
 a little more professional and especially 

00:06:27.070 --> 00:06:30.310
 you are going to have dual sim support 

00:06:28.510 --> 00:06:31.330
 which will be very practical especially and 

00:06:30.310 --> 00:06:33.640
 alright if you're in the audio 

00:06:31.330 --> 00:06:36.320
 professional or that you like to travel 

00:06:33.640 --> 00:06:38.240
 that you have two sim cards 

00:06:36.320 --> 00:06:42.500
 Here it was actually so it was this 

00:06:38.240 --> 00:06:44.960
 lumia 640 pixels that comes after his 

00:06:42.500 --> 00:06:46.520
 little brother the 640 and that was announced 

00:06:44.960 --> 00:06:48.820
 during this mobile world congress to 

00:06:46.520 --> 00:06:48.820
 barcelona
