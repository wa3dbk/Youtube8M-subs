00:00:27.950 --> 00:00:27.960 
comparing gear now you know obviously

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:30.050 
comparing gear now you know obviously
when<00:00:28.320> you<00:00:28.380> play<00:00:28.529> diablo<00:00:29.070> 3<00:00:29.400> are<00:00:29.730> you<00:00:29.880> really

I'm is important I want to find more
drops<00:01:19.049> and<00:01:19.320> you<00:01:19.979> know<00:01:20.100> the<00:01:21.030> difference<00:01:21.329> in

00:01:21.469 --> 00:01:21.479 
drops and you know the difference in

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:23.390 
drops and you know the difference in
damage<00:01:21.840> is<00:01:21.960> not<00:01:21.990> really<00:01:22.350> going<00:01:22.500> to<00:01:22.560> be<00:01:22.770> that

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:23.400 
damage is not really going to be that

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:26.719 
damage is not really going to be that
effective<00:01:23.880> and<00:01:24.329> the<00:01:24.930> difference<00:01:25.320> in<00:01:25.520> you<00:01:26.520> know

effective and the difference in you know

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:28.010 
effective and the difference in you know
survivability<00:01:27.210> has<00:01:27.509> reached<00:01:27.750> the<00:01:27.810> point

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:28.020 
survivability has reached the point

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:30.080 
survivability has reached the point
where<00:01:28.170> I<00:01:28.229> don't<00:01:28.409> really<00:01:28.590> need<00:01:28.710> any<00:01:28.950> more<00:01:29.130> so

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:30.090 
where I don't really need any more so

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:31.940 
where I don't really need any more so
what<00:01:30.180> does<00:01:30.240> that<00:01:30.299> really<00:01:30.509> mean<00:01:30.630> well<00:01:31.290> when<00:01:31.920> I

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:31.950 
what does that really mean well when I

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:35.420 
what does that really mean well when I
play<00:01:32.220> solo<00:01:32.670> I<00:01:33.329> have<00:01:33.780> enough<00:01:34.170> damage<00:01:34.590> to<00:01:35.280> where

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:35.430 
play solo I have enough damage to where

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:38.030 
play solo I have enough damage to where
I<00:01:35.460> can<00:01:35.640> rend<00:01:36.119> the<00:01:36.390> moms<00:01:36.600> and<00:01:36.899> all<00:01:37.380> diameter

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:38.040 
I can rend the moms and all diameter

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:39.710 
I can rend the moms and all diameter
champions<00:01:38.490> on<00:01:38.759> unless<00:01:39.240> they're<00:01:39.420> one<00:01:39.570> of<00:01:39.600> the

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:39.720 
champions on unless they're one of the

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:41.120 
champions on unless they're one of the
big<00:01:39.899> mom's<00:01:40.110> which<00:01:40.380> doesn't<00:01:40.799> really<00:01:40.860> matter

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:41.130 
big mom's which doesn't really matter

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:42.410 
big mom's which doesn't really matter
because<00:01:41.579> I<00:01:41.790> can<00:01:41.939> just<00:01:42.060> you<00:01:42.149> know<00:01:42.210> take<00:01:42.390> a

00:01:42.410 --> 00:01:42.420 
because I can just you know take a

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:45.679 
because I can just you know take a
second<00:01:42.810> or<00:01:42.869> two<00:01:42.930> extra<00:01:43.259> killer<00:01:43.909> so<00:01:44.909> if<00:01:45.479> i<00:01:45.630> do

00:01:45.679 --> 00:01:45.689 
second or two extra killer so if i do

will die twice as fast but as a marginal
increase<00:02:07.560> in<00:02:07.770> efficiency<00:02:08.009> it<00:02:08.910> is<00:02:09.090> nowhere

near<00:02:10.140> double<00:02:10.649> in<00:02:10.800> fact<00:02:11.160> I<00:02:11.370> would<00:02:11.640> argue<00:02:11.670> it's

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:12.120 
near double in fact I would argue it's

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:12.700 
near double in fact I would argue it's
in<00:02:12.300> my

00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:12.710 
in my

00:02:12.710 --> 00:02:15.040 
in my
ten<00:02:13.040> twenty<00:02:13.490> percent<00:02:13.820> range<00:02:14.090> it's<00:02:14.360> very<00:02:14.660> small

00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:15.050 
ten twenty percent range it's very small

00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:17.830 
ten twenty percent range it's very small
so<00:02:15.800> having<00:02:16.130> a<00:02:16.280> lot<00:02:16.700> of<00:02:16.730> extra<00:02:17.150> magic<00:02:17.270> fine<00:02:17.630> as

00:02:17.830 --> 00:02:17.840 
so having a lot of extra magic fine as

00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:20.140 
so having a lot of extra magic fine as
you<00:02:18.260> can<00:02:18.350> see<00:02:18.500> i<00:02:18.530> have<00:02:18.590> like<00:02:18.950> you<00:02:19.160> know<00:02:19.190> 244

00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:20.150 
you can see i have like you know 244

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:21.880 
you can see i have like you know 244
which<00:02:20.240> i'm<00:02:20.330> pretty<00:02:20.510> happy<00:02:20.870> with<00:02:21.110> it<00:02:21.380> found

00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:21.890 
which i'm pretty happy with it found

00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:24.210 
which i'm pretty happy with it found
some<00:02:22.070> pretty<00:02:22.220> good<00:02:22.400> gear<00:02:22.670> you<00:02:23.210> know<00:02:23.270> that's

00:02:24.210 --> 00:02:24.220 
some pretty good gear you know that's

00:02:24.220 --> 00:02:26.530 
some pretty good gear you know that's
largely<00:02:25.220> more<00:02:25.580> important<00:02:25.970> to<00:02:26.060> me<00:02:26.090> than<00:02:26.210> that

00:02:26.530 --> 00:02:26.540 
largely more important to me than that

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:28.840 
largely more important to me than that
when<00:02:27.170> i<00:02:27.230> play<00:02:27.410> in<00:02:27.470> a<00:02:27.560> group<00:02:27.800> situation<00:02:27.950> and<00:02:28.520> the

00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:28.850 
when i play in a group situation and the

00:02:28.850 --> 00:02:31.030 
when i play in a group situation and the
mobs<00:02:29.030> don't<00:02:29.360> die<00:02:29.570> in<00:02:29.720> like<00:02:29.840> one<00:02:30.110> rent<00:02:30.380> you<00:02:30.920> know

my<00:02:31.220> my<00:02:31.790> differences<00:02:32.270> again<00:02:32.570> is<00:02:32.690> not<00:02:32.870> as<00:02:33.020> big

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:33.760 
my my differences again is not as big

00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:36.490 
my my differences again is not as big
because<00:02:34.760> largely<00:02:35.060> in<00:02:35.330> a<00:02:35.480> group<00:02:35.720> you're<00:02:36.320> there

00:02:56.350 --> 00:02:56.360 
to begin with you have to really

00:02:56.360 --> 00:02:58.570 
to begin with you have to really
evaluate<00:02:56.630> your<00:02:57.020> skills<00:02:57.170> you<00:02:57.620> know<00:02:57.710> my<00:02:58.250> skills

all<00:03:25.700> then<00:03:26.690> you<00:03:26.810> have<00:03:26.990> revenge<00:03:27.500> which<00:03:27.800> is<00:03:27.950> not

00:03:28.120 --> 00:03:28.130 
all then you have revenge which is not

00:03:28.130 --> 00:03:30.490 
all then you have revenge which is not

affected at all by haste you know so you

00:03:30.500 --> 00:03:32.650 
affected at all by haste you know so you
have<00:03:30.620> all<00:03:30.860> these<00:03:30.980> abilities<00:03:31.220> and<00:03:31.670> you<00:03:32.540> know

an item like this you know i'm seeing

00:03:44.720 --> 00:03:47.410 
an item like this you know i'm seeing
it's<00:03:44.870> like<00:03:44.990> hmm<00:03:45.920> let's<00:03:46.850> get<00:03:47.000> it<00:03:47.090> in<00:03:47.150> care<00:03:47.300> of<00:03:47.390> a

00:03:47.410 --> 00:03:47.420 
it's like hmm let's get it in care of a

00:03:47.420 --> 00:03:51.040 
it's like hmm let's get it in care of a
magic<00:03:47.750> sign<00:03:47.900> right<00:03:48.110> um<00:03:49.300> point<00:03:50.300> for<00:03:50.510> protection

for<00:03:51.410> 352<00:03:52.340> m<00:03:52.520> justin's<00:03:52.880> get<00:03:53.060> pretty<00:03:53.240> good

00:03:53.290 --> 00:03:53.300 
for 352 m justin's get pretty good

00:03:53.300 --> 00:03:54.670 
for 352 m justin's get pretty good
trade-off<00:03:53.630> maybe<00:03:53.960> i'll<00:03:54.080> make<00:03:54.260> that<00:03:54.290> right

00:03:54.670 --> 00:03:54.680 
trade-off maybe i'll make that right

00:03:54.680 --> 00:03:58.620 
trade-off maybe i'll make that right
well<00:03:55.690> not<00:03:56.690> really<00:03:56.920> see<00:03:57.920> the<00:03:58.040> problem<00:03:58.190> is

00:03:58.620 --> 00:03:58.630 
well not really see the problem is

00:03:58.630 --> 00:04:01.870 
well not really see the problem is
deception<00:03:59.630> attack<00:04:00.080> speed<00:04:00.350> i<00:04:00.880> doesn't

deception attack speed i doesn't
actually<00:04:02.180> equate<00:04:02.810> very<00:04:03.170> much<00:04:03.410> well<00:04:04.130> you<00:04:04.820> may

00:04:04.960 --> 00:04:04.970 
actually equate very much well you may

00:04:04.970 --> 00:04:07.000 
actually equate very much well you may
be<00:04:05.030> correct<00:04:05.630> in<00:04:05.960> assuming<00:04:06.200> that<00:04:06.410> you<00:04:06.740> know<00:04:06.860> the

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:07.010 
be correct in assuming that you know the

00:04:07.010 --> 00:04:09.100 
be correct in assuming that you know the
crit<00:04:07.670> chance<00:04:07.700> also<00:04:08.210> doesn't<00:04:08.540> affect<00:04:08.750> me<00:04:08.900> very

00:04:09.100 --> 00:04:09.110 
crit chance also doesn't affect me very

00:04:09.110 --> 00:04:12.490 
crit chance also doesn't affect me very
much<00:04:09.290> but<00:04:10.040> it<00:04:10.640> does<00:04:10.880> a<00:04:10.910> lot<00:04:11.240> more<00:04:11.300> than<00:04:11.840> attack

00:04:12.490 --> 00:04:12.500 
much but it does a lot more than attack

00:04:12.500 --> 00:04:14.590 
much but it does a lot more than attack
speed<00:04:12.770> does<00:04:12.950> and<00:04:13.190> the<00:04:13.820> strength<00:04:14.150> and<00:04:14.270> damage

00:04:14.590 --> 00:04:14.600 
speed does and the strength and damage

00:04:14.600 --> 00:04:15.790 
speed does and the strength and damage
bonus<00:04:14.780> is<00:04:15.020> higher<00:04:15.230> than<00:04:15.350> the<00:04:15.410> strength<00:04:15.710> and

00:04:15.790 --> 00:04:15.800 
bonus is higher than the strength and

bonus is higher than the strength and
damage<00:04:16.100> bonus<00:04:16.310> on<00:04:16.549> the<00:04:16.670> attack<00:04:16.940> speed<00:04:17.210> ring<00:04:17.390> so

00:04:18.099 --> 00:04:18.109 
damage bonus on the attack speed ring so

00:04:18.109 --> 00:04:20.800 
damage bonus on the attack speed ring so
overall<00:04:18.710> the<00:04:19.250> damage<00:04:19.670> is<00:04:20.239> going<00:04:20.480> to<00:04:20.540> be<00:04:20.600> much

00:04:20.800 --> 00:04:20.810 
overall the damage is going to be much

00:04:20.810 --> 00:04:22.630 
overall the damage is going to be much
greater<00:04:21.020> than<00:04:21.260> three<00:04:21.590> hundred<00:04:21.650> and<00:04:21.980> even<00:04:22.550> if

00:04:22.630 --> 00:04:22.640 
greater than three hundred and even if

greater than three hundred and even if
this<00:04:22.790> ring<00:04:23.030> had<00:04:23.210> like<00:04:23.360> plus<00:04:23.690> 300<00:04:24.110> a<00:04:24.200> bitch

00:04:24.490 --> 00:04:24.500 
this ring had like plus 300 a bitch

00:04:24.500 --> 00:04:28.360 
this ring had like plus 300 a bitch
still<00:04:24.890> with<00:04:25.100> you<00:04:25.310> you<00:04:26.090> know<00:04:26.120> and<00:04:26.980> you<00:04:27.980> know

still with you you know and you know
when<00:04:28.520> it<00:04:28.580> comes<00:04:28.640> to<00:04:28.820> protection<00:04:29.390> in<00:04:29.510> this<00:04:30.080> case

00:04:30.310 --> 00:04:30.320 
when it comes to protection in this case

00:04:30.320 --> 00:04:32.350 
when it comes to protection in this case
it's<00:04:30.590> it's<00:04:30.950> a<00:04:31.130> direct<00:04:31.400> comparison<00:04:31.760> it<00:04:32.090> makes

00:04:32.350 --> 00:04:32.360 
it's it's a direct comparison it makes

00:04:32.360 --> 00:04:34.750 
it's it's a direct comparison it makes
sense<00:04:32.600> its<00:04:32.840> armor<00:04:33.140> and<00:04:33.410> resist<00:04:33.770> versus<00:04:34.160> less

resist<00:04:35.210> and<00:04:35.450> less<00:04:36.350> armor<00:04:36.610> but<00:04:37.610> when<00:04:37.760> it<00:04:37.880> comes

00:04:38.050 --> 00:04:38.060 
resist and less armor but when it comes

00:04:38.060 --> 00:04:40.270 
resist and less armor but when it comes
to<00:04:38.330> a<00:04:38.360> certain<00:04:38.930> other<00:04:39.050> rings<00:04:39.320> like<00:04:39.590> these<00:04:39.830> you

00:04:40.270 --> 00:04:40.280 
to a certain other rings like these you

00:04:40.280 --> 00:04:42.130 
to a certain other rings like these you
know<00:04:40.400> so<00:04:41.030> I'm<00:04:41.120> looking<00:04:41.270> at<00:04:41.510> this<00:04:41.570> ring<00:04:41.930> let's

00:04:42.130 --> 00:04:42.140 
know so I'm looking at this ring let's

00:04:42.140 --> 00:04:45.460 
know so I'm looking at this ring let's
just<00:04:42.320> say<00:04:42.440> it<00:04:42.560> was<00:04:42.770> like<00:04:43.070> you<00:04:43.460> know<00:04:43.610> a<00:04:44.470> damaged

00:04:45.460 --> 00:04:45.470 
just say it was like you know a damaged

00:04:45.470 --> 00:04:48.610 
just say it was like you know a damaged
upgrade<00:04:45.800> of<00:04:45.890> like<00:04:46.040> 50<00:04:46.550> would<00:04:47.330> not<00:04:47.540> use<00:04:47.690> it<00:04:47.870> no

00:04:48.610 --> 00:04:48.620 
upgrade of like 50 would not use it no

00:04:48.620 --> 00:04:51.640 
upgrade of like 50 would not use it no
why<00:04:49.400> would<00:04:49.460> I<00:04:49.640> use<00:04:49.850> it<00:04:50.060> you<00:04:50.810> see<00:04:51.050> the<00:04:51.440> game

00:04:51.640 --> 00:04:51.650 
why would I use it you see the game

00:04:51.650 --> 00:04:54.010 
why would I use it you see the game

00:04:58.600 --> 00:04:58.610 
out the number of attacks that you would

00:04:58.610 --> 00:05:02.020 
out the number of attacks that you would
dodge<00:04:58.880> with<00:04:59.360> dexterity<00:04:59.930> as<00:05:00.760> that<00:05:01.760> being

00:05:10.270 --> 00:05:10.280 
hitting you from very little damage then

00:05:10.280 --> 00:05:13.690 
hitting you from very little damage then
yes<00:05:11.270> that<00:05:11.900> is<00:05:12.050> appropriate<00:05:12.260> but<00:05:13.220> if<00:05:13.430> you're

00:05:13.690 --> 00:05:13.700 
yes that is appropriate but if you're

00:05:13.700 --> 00:05:15.520 
yes that is appropriate but if you're
gonna<00:05:13.850> die<00:05:14.150> in<00:05:14.419> a<00:05:14.540> short<00:05:14.810> amount<00:05:14.900> of<00:05:15.080> time<00:05:15.140> for

00:05:15.520 --> 00:05:15.530 
gonna die in a short amount of time for

00:05:15.530 --> 00:05:18.520 
gonna die in a short amount of time for

00:05:18.520 --> 00:05:18.530 
a few amount of hips which is a very

00:05:18.530 --> 00:05:22.930 
a few amount of hips which is a very
likely<00:05:18.890> scenario<00:05:19.580> then<00:05:20.710> you<00:05:21.710> know<00:05:21.830> how<00:05:22.760> do<00:05:22.820> you

00:05:22.930 --> 00:05:22.940 
likely scenario then you know how do you

00:05:22.940 --> 00:05:26.460 
likely scenario then you know how do you
really<00:05:23.410> how<00:05:24.410> do<00:05:24.470> you<00:05:24.530> really<00:05:24.770> figure<00:05:25.010> that<00:05:25.160> out

00:05:26.460 --> 00:05:26.470 
really how do you really figure that out

00:05:26.470 --> 00:05:29.950 
really how do you really figure that out
it's<00:05:27.470> obvious<00:05:27.919> obvious<00:05:28.729> to<00:05:29.540> people<00:05:29.570> who

00:05:29.950 --> 00:05:29.960 
it's obvious obvious to people who

00:05:29.960 --> 00:05:31.420 
it's obvious obvious to people who
really<00:05:30.080> understand<00:05:30.500> the<00:05:30.620> stats<00:05:30.890> that

um<00:07:13.689> yes<00:07:14.689> the<00:07:15.349> apple<00:07:15.560> trees<00:07:15.770> a<00:07:15.949> game<00:07:16.219> about<00:07:16.370> gear

00:07:16.779 --> 00:07:16.789 
um yes the apple trees a game about gear

00:07:16.789 --> 00:07:18.850 
um yes the apple trees a game about gear
you<00:07:17.300> want<00:07:17.449> more<00:07:17.659> gear<00:07:17.990> you<00:07:18.259> want<00:07:18.409> overall

00:07:18.850 --> 00:07:18.860 
you want more gear you want overall

00:07:18.860 --> 00:07:20.769 
you want more gear you want overall
better<00:07:19.129> gear<00:07:19.580> but<00:07:20.270> when<00:07:20.360> it<00:07:20.479> comes<00:07:20.659> to

00:07:20.769 --> 00:07:20.779 
better gear but when it comes to

00:07:20.779 --> 00:07:22.929 
better gear but when it comes to
maximizing<00:07:20.960> your<00:07:21.590> efficiency<00:07:22.129> you<00:07:22.699> really

00:07:22.929 --> 00:07:22.939 
maximizing your efficiency you really

00:07:22.939 --> 00:07:24.850 
maximizing your efficiency you really
have<00:07:23.090> to<00:07:23.210> be<00:07:23.360> smart<00:07:23.719> and<00:07:23.870> choosy<00:07:24.560> with<00:07:24.710> your

00:07:24.850 --> 00:07:24.860 
have to be smart and choosy with your

00:07:24.860 --> 00:07:28.240 
have to be smart and choosy with your
stats<00:07:25.189> you<00:07:25.729> have<00:07:25.939> to<00:07:26.120> know<00:07:26.199> at<00:07:27.199> what<00:07:27.229> point<00:07:27.710> you

00:07:28.240 --> 00:07:28.250 
stats you have to know at what point you

00:07:28.250 --> 00:07:30.459 
stats you have to know at what point you
have<00:07:28.460> enough<00:07:28.879> of<00:07:29.120> something<00:07:29.629> to<00:07:30.229> where<00:07:30.379> you

00:07:30.459 --> 00:07:30.469 
have enough of something to where you

00:07:30.469 --> 00:07:32.170 
have enough of something to where you
can<00:07:30.620> focus<00:07:30.860> on<00:07:31.159> things<00:07:31.430> that<00:07:31.610> you<00:07:31.759> don't<00:07:31.939> have

00:07:32.170 --> 00:07:32.180 
can focus on things that you don't have

00:07:32.180 --> 00:07:35.050 
can focus on things that you don't have
enough<00:07:32.419> of<00:07:32.629> as<00:07:32.840> shown<00:07:33.770> in<00:07:33.830> my<00:07:34.099> case<00:07:34.370> I<00:07:34.639> have

00:07:35.050 --> 00:07:35.060 
enough of as shown in my case I have

00:07:35.060 --> 00:07:36.879 
enough of as shown in my case I have
enough<00:07:35.389> damage<00:07:35.779> have<00:07:36.050> enough<00:07:36.379> survivability

00:07:36.879 --> 00:07:36.889 
enough damage have enough survivability

00:07:36.889 --> 00:07:39.249 
enough damage have enough survivability
I<00:07:37.279> didn't<00:07:37.849> have<00:07:37.939> enough<00:07:38.150> magic<00:07:38.330> fine<00:07:38.719> so<00:07:39.199> I

00:07:39.249 --> 00:07:39.259 
I didn't have enough magic fine so I

00:07:39.259 --> 00:07:40.809 
I didn't have enough magic fine so I
wanted<00:07:39.620> some<00:07:39.770> management<00:07:40.039> fine<00:07:40.279> so<00:07:40.460> magic

00:07:40.809 --> 00:07:40.819 
wanted some management fine so magic

00:07:40.819 --> 00:07:44.019 
wanted some management fine so magic
fine<00:07:41.000> gave<00:07:41.629> a<00:07:41.659> lot<00:07:41.930> of<00:07:41.960> value<00:07:42.440> for<00:07:42.710> me<00:07:42.830> and<00:07:43.039> you

00:07:44.019 --> 00:07:44.029 
fine gave a lot of value for me and you

00:07:44.029 --> 00:07:45.760 
fine gave a lot of value for me and you
know<00:07:44.150> maybe<00:07:44.449> it's<00:07:44.719> not<00:07:44.900> magic<00:07:45.289> fine<00:07:45.469> for<00:07:45.680> you

00:07:45.760 --> 00:07:45.770 
know maybe it's not magic fine for you

00:07:45.770 --> 00:07:47.680 
know maybe it's not magic fine for you
maybe<00:07:46.009> it's<00:07:46.219> survivability<00:07:46.759> maybe<00:07:47.479> its

00:07:47.680 --> 00:07:47.690 
maybe it's survivability maybe its

00:07:47.690 --> 00:07:49.420 
maybe it's survivability maybe its
movement<00:07:48.169> speed<00:07:48.379> maybe<00:07:48.949> it's<00:07:49.190> some<00:07:49.370> other

00:07:49.420 --> 00:07:49.430 
movement speed maybe it's some other

00:07:49.430 --> 00:07:51.249 
movement speed maybe it's some other
factors<00:07:50.000> but<00:07:50.509> it's<00:07:50.659> something<00:07:50.839> that<00:07:51.050> you<00:07:51.080> guys

00:07:51.249 --> 00:07:51.259 
factors but it's something that you guys

00:07:51.259 --> 00:07:53.079 
factors but it's something that you guys
should<00:07:51.409> really<00:07:51.440> think<00:07:51.800> about<00:07:51.949> because<00:07:52.729> in<00:07:53.000> the

00:07:53.079 --> 00:07:53.089 
should really think about because in the

00:07:53.089 --> 00:07:56.980 
should really think about because in the
end<00:07:53.120> high<00:07:53.779> damage<00:07:54.050> is<00:07:54.349> good<00:07:54.589> and<00:07:54.710> all<00:07:54.860> but<00:07:55.990> it

00:07:56.980 --> 00:07:56.990 
end high damage is good and all but it

00:07:56.990 --> 00:07:58.600 
end high damage is good and all but it
doesn't<00:07:57.379> matter<00:07:57.469> that<00:07:57.620> much<00:07:57.770> if<00:07:58.219> you're<00:07:58.400> just

00:07:58.600 --> 00:07:58.610 
doesn't matter that much if you're just

00:07:58.610 --> 00:08:00.939 
doesn't matter that much if you're just
trying<00:07:58.940> to<00:07:59.150> grind<00:07:59.779> mobs<00:08:00.110> effectively<00:08:00.740> and

00:08:00.939 --> 00:08:00.949 
trying to grind mobs effectively and

00:08:00.949 --> 00:08:04.629 
trying to grind mobs effectively and
hitting<00:08:01.460> that<00:08:01.550> maximum<00:08:02.120> efficiency<00:08:02.330> point<00:08:03.639> so

00:08:04.629 --> 00:08:04.639 
hitting that maximum efficiency point so

00:08:04.639 --> 00:08:07.329 
hitting that maximum efficiency point so
a<00:08:04.699> be<00:08:05.060> smart<00:08:05.389> be<00:08:05.839> aware<00:08:06.110> i'll<00:08:07.039> see<00:08:07.219> you<00:08:07.310> guys

00:08:07.329 --> 00:08:07.339 
a be smart be aware i'll see you guys

00:08:07.339 --> 00:08:09.759
