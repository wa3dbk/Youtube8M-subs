what I did was I left the carburetor on
there<00:00:32.040> this<00:00:33.040> is<00:00:33.190> where<00:00:33.370> the<00:00:33.489> gas<00:00:33.730> line<00:00:34.030> plugged

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:34.390 
there this is where the gas line plugged

00:00:34.390 --> 00:00:39.030 
there this is where the gas line plugged
in<00:00:34.570> before<00:00:34.960> I<00:00:35.850> just<00:00:36.850> pulled<00:00:37.120> that<00:00:37.180> off<00:00:37.300> I<00:00:38.040> put

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:39.040 
in before I just pulled that off I put

00:00:39.040 --> 00:00:42.870 
in before I just pulled that off I put
this<00:00:39.510> the<00:00:40.510> air<00:00:40.780> filter<00:00:41.560> I<00:00:41.800> took<00:00:42.460> it<00:00:42.580> off<00:00:42.700> and

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:42.880 
this the air filter I took it off and

00:00:42.880 --> 00:00:44.430 
this the air filter I took it off and
turn<00:00:43.060> it<00:00:43.150> upside<00:00:43.270> down<00:00:43.450> the<00:00:43.810> air<00:00:43.930> filter<00:00:44.260> used

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:44.440 
turn it upside down the air filter used

00:00:44.440 --> 00:00:45.330 
turn it upside down the air filter used
to<00:00:44.530> be<00:00:44.620> on<00:00:44.740> top

00:00:45.330 --> 00:00:45.340 
to be on top

00:00:45.340 --> 00:00:47.940 
to be on top
the<00:00:46.000> reason<00:00:46.270> I<00:00:46.360> did<00:00:46.540> it<00:00:46.660> was<00:00:46.840> I<00:00:47.230> was<00:00:47.560> hoping<00:00:47.830> the

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:47.950 
the reason I did it was I was hoping the

00:00:47.950 --> 00:00:56.850 
the reason I did it was I was hoping the
gas<00:00:48.130> would<00:00:48.340> come<00:00:48.550> in<00:00:48.670> here<00:00:48.970> there's<00:00:55.860> necessary

00:00:56.850 --> 00:00:56.860 
gas would come in here there's necessary

00:00:56.860 --> 00:01:03.240 
gas would come in here there's necessary
I<00:00:57.670> taped<00:00:58.630> the<00:00:58.780> bottom<00:00:59.170> off<00:01:01.110> completely<00:01:02.110> I<00:01:02.560> just

00:01:03.240 --> 00:01:03.250 
I taped the bottom off completely I just

00:01:03.250 --> 00:01:04.859 
I taped the bottom off completely I just
put<00:01:03.430> the<00:01:03.520> tape<00:01:03.700> on<00:01:03.910> it<00:01:04.089> I<00:01:04.180> had<00:01:04.299> to<00:01:04.390> hold<00:01:04.540> my<00:01:04.659> hand

00:01:04.859 --> 00:01:04.869 
put the tape on it I had to hold my hand

00:01:04.869 --> 00:01:06.330 
put the tape on it I had to hold my hand
on<00:01:04.989> it<00:01:05.110> before<00:01:05.229> so<00:01:05.619> I'm<00:01:05.680> hoping<00:01:05.950> that<00:01:06.009> works

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:06.340 
on it before so I'm hoping that works

00:01:06.340 --> 00:01:10.150 
on it before so I'm hoping that works

00:01:19.870 --> 00:01:19.880 
it's my generator have dead batteries so

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:22.480 
it's my generator have dead batteries so
I<00:01:19.940> can't<00:01:20.240> I<00:01:20.510> can't<00:01:21.200> pull<00:01:21.530> the<00:01:21.770> full<00:01:21.979> juice<00:01:22.250> that

00:01:22.480 --> 00:01:22.490 
I can't I can't pull the full juice that

I can't I can't pull the full juice that
I<00:01:22.520> need<00:01:23.260> to<00:01:24.260> pull<00:01:24.920> the<00:01:25.130> 30<00:01:25.970> amps<00:01:26.360> each<00:01:26.479> is<00:01:26.690> what

00:01:26.830 --> 00:01:26.840 
I need to pull the 30 amps each is what

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:29.890 
I need to pull the 30 amps each is what
I'm<00:01:26.960> running<00:01:27.320> on<00:01:27.500> these<00:01:28.100> so<00:01:28.340> it's<00:01:28.460> 60<00:01:28.850> amps<00:01:29.270> it

00:01:29.890 --> 00:01:29.900 
I'm running on these so it's 60 amps it

00:01:29.900 --> 00:01:34.180 
I'm running on these so it's 60 amps it
doesn't<00:01:30.229> quite<00:01:30.380> pull<00:01:30.619> it<00:01:30.880> the<00:01:32.800> so<00:01:33.800> I<00:01:33.830> have<00:01:34.159> a

00:01:34.180 --> 00:01:34.190 
doesn't quite pull it the so I have a

00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:38.560 
doesn't quite pull it the so I have a
balloon<00:01:34.520> that<00:01:35.200> I<00:01:36.200> use<00:01:36.440> for<00:01:37.090> to<00:01:38.090> make<00:01:38.210> up<00:01:38.420> the

00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:38.570 
balloon that I use for to make up the

00:01:38.570 --> 00:01:59.150 
balloon that I use for to make up the
difference<00:01:38.750> I<00:01:39.110> guess

00:01:59.150 --> 00:01:59.160 

00:01:59.160 --> 00:02:02.670 

all<00:02:00.160> right<00:02:00.340> I<00:02:00.610> just<00:02:00.790> changed<00:02:01.480> my<00:02:01.570> hoses<00:02:02.080> to<00:02:02.230> 3/8

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:02.680 
all right I just changed my hoses to 3/8

00:02:02.680 --> 00:02:05.580 
all right I just changed my hoses to 3/8
hoses<00:02:03.310> you<00:02:03.600> see<00:02:04.600> the<00:02:04.720> production<00:02:04.990> going<00:02:05.380> in

00:02:05.580 --> 00:02:05.590 
hoses you see the production going in

00:02:05.590 --> 00:02:09.240 
hoses you see the production going in
there<00:02:06.330> it<00:02:07.330> cycles<00:02:08.170> the<00:02:08.229> water<00:02:08.410> really<00:02:08.679> good<00:02:09.009> I

00:02:09.240 --> 00:02:09.250 
there it cycles the water really good I

00:02:09.250 --> 00:02:14.850 
there it cycles the water really good I
got<00:02:09.670> both<00:02:10.390> inlets<00:02:10.869> coming<00:02:11.400> in<00:02:12.400> the<00:02:12.550> top<00:02:13.860> and

00:02:14.850 --> 00:02:14.860 
got both inlets coming in the top and

00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:20.900 
got both inlets coming in the top and
out<00:02:15.130> the<00:02:15.310> top<00:02:15.490> so<00:02:18.150> there's<00:02:19.150> my<00:02:19.300> production

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:20.910 
out the top so there's my production

00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:25.890 
out the top so there's my production
anyway<00:02:21.910> and<00:02:22.270> I<00:02:22.420> built<00:02:24.300> built<00:02:25.300> to<00:02:25.540> spark

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:25.900 
anyway and I built built to spark

00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:29.190 
anyway and I built built to spark
arresters<00:02:26.700> they're<00:02:27.700> only<00:02:27.850> good<00:02:28.120> for<00:02:28.150> I<00:02:28.720> did

00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:29.200 
arresters they're only good for I did

00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:33.300 
arresters they're only good for I did
some<00:02:29.380> tests<00:02:29.709> on<00:02:29.830> it<00:02:29.860> they're<00:02:30.430> only<00:02:30.550> good<00:02:30.790> for<00:02:32.310> 2

00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:33.310 
some tests on it they're only good for 2

00:02:33.310 --> 00:02:36.210 
some tests on it they're only good for 2
liters<00:02:33.910> a<00:02:33.940> minute<00:02:34.150> each<00:02:34.630> so<00:02:35.200> through<00:02:35.860> this<00:02:36.040> I

liters a minute each so through this I

00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:38.790 
liters a minute each so through this I
can<00:02:36.370> push<00:02:36.610> 4<00:02:36.910> litres<00:02:37.209> a<00:02:37.239> minute<00:02:37.530> which<00:02:38.530> I<00:02:38.680> am

00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:38.800

00:04:38.850 --> 00:04:38.860 
need to produce more gas get the RPMs up

00:04:38.860 --> 00:04:43.920 
need to produce more gas get the RPMs up
and<00:04:39.870> run<00:04:40.870> a<00:04:41.100> 230<00:04:42.100> amp<00:04:42.310> alternator<00:04:42.580> they<00:04:43.570> say<00:04:43.780> it

00:04:43.920 --> 00:04:43.930 
and run a 230 amp alternator they say it

00:04:43.930 --> 00:04:47.790 
and run a 230 amp alternator they say it
takes<00:04:44.110> about<00:04:44.230> ten<00:04:44.620> horsepower<00:04:44.920> and<00:04:46.800> about

00:04:47.790 --> 00:04:47.800

twenty<00:04:48.510> around<00:04:49.510> 2000<00:04:50.140> or<00:04:50.200> 2100<00:04:50.950> rpm<00:04:51.790> and<00:04:53.670> so<00:04:54.670> I

00:04:54.720 --> 00:04:54.730 
twenty around 2000 or 2100 rpm and so I

twenty around 2000 or 2100 rpm and so I
need<00:04:54.880> to<00:04:54.940> make<00:04:55.060> enough<00:04:55.330> gas<00:04:55.540> to<00:04:55.780> produce<00:04:57.630> the

00:04:58.620 --> 00:04:58.630 
need to make enough gas to produce the

00:04:58.630 --> 00:05:03.030 
need to make enough gas to produce the
RPMs<00:04:59.050> I<00:04:59.200> need<00:04:59.410> and<00:05:00.060> and<00:05:01.060> will<00:05:01.750> have<00:05:01.900> it<00:05:02.080> thanks
