00:00:00.709 --> 00:00:04.730
 hello today i will show you 

00:00:02.520 --> 00:00:07.620
 how to make a brioche stars and 

00:00:04.730 --> 00:00:10.320
 so I prepared my paw that I 

00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:12.570
 cut into four legs or each leg 

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:15.330
 froze went with my lot to 

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:16.949
 pastry I then cut the lathe 

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:18.090
 by putting a plate on it for me 

00:00:16.949 --> 00:00:21.570
 make a template so I removed 

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:22.769
 remove the dough that was that was in 

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:24.960
 too much all around 

00:00:22.769 --> 00:00:27.240
 so I made four 4 layers 

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:29.070
 different and inside each 

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:31.830
 layer I put some spread on 

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:33.210
 my partner's chocolate so 

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:35.010
 after you can use the dough to 

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:36.239
 spread that you want or everything 

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:38.460
 to simply melt 

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:41.040
 chocolate which you prefer so I put 

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:43.079
 a little drink in the middle and I'm going 

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:43.980
 then share my brioche in 16 parts 

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:45.780
 equal 

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:49.050
 I already started sharing everything 

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:53.160
 this side there so I continue so 

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:56.100
 I'm going to know about the center I'm talking about 

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:57.780
 my glass and I cut up to 

00:00:56.100 --> 00:01:00.090
 ends of the fatah sion has not cut my 

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:02.879
 silpat canvas which underneath so take 

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:04.949
 preferably a knife that is pretty 

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:06.750
 sharp so as not to crush 

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:09.510
 your dough is otherwise it risks 

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:12.500
 then take out the hamlet from the 

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:15.180
 Spread pastry game related to the middle 

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:19.250
 so I finished cutting hans hess parts 

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:22.850
 equal and then I'll be able to 

00:01:19.250 --> 00:01:22.850
 start shaping 

00:01:30.400 --> 00:01:35.410
 so to do in 16 equal parts you 

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:38.500
 cut first in two years eight years 4 

00:01:35.410 --> 00:01:45.960
 then you continue in 8ths then 

00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:45.960
 16 do not you do that 16 by 

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:58.070
 so my last my last layer of 

00:01:55.580 --> 00:02:00.649
 paste is slightly wider than the 

00:01:58.070 --> 00:02:06.500
 others so as to cover a little bit 

00:02:00.649 --> 00:02:17.060
 there others and not from below so there 

00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:18.590
 I finished cutting in 16 by then 

00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:21.620
 now I'm going to take the sides 

00:02:18.590 --> 00:02:23.330
 two by two I take two sides that 

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:34.250
 are one next to the other I raise 

00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:35.690
 well to the center so here I 

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:39.370
 take my two leaves and I'll go 

00:02:35.690 --> 00:02:44.120
 turned towards each other first round 

00:02:39.370 --> 00:02:45.739
 and then second round so you 

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:47.870
 can leave both your legs like that 

00:02:45.739 --> 00:02:50.930
 next to each other or the 

00:02:47.870 --> 00:02:57.560
 to stick if you wish me them I 

00:02:50.930 --> 00:03:00.590
 leave that nato tv like that if 

00:02:57.560 --> 00:03:02.030
 kids want to take a little 

00:03:00.590 --> 00:03:03.440
 piece and can just take a 

00:03:02.030 --> 00:03:04.430
 piece if not after caen has welded 

00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:05.930
 it's true that we have to take 

00:03:04.430 --> 00:03:07.040
 a big part so here it makes you 

00:03:05.930 --> 00:03:09.500
 really it's this parent who are 

00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:15.650
 downright individual so I turn a 

00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:18.109
 once I turn a second time and 

00:03:15.650 --> 00:03:21.590
 so on until I have 

00:03:18.109 --> 00:03:25.940
 returned all my little pieces 

00:03:21.590 --> 00:03:28.570
 once I get back into the water in the east a 

00:03:25.940 --> 00:03:28.570
 second time 

00:03:32.470 --> 00:03:55.150
 Thursday sticks well to the paws once a 

00:03:38.900 --> 00:03:59.030
 second time once a second 

00:03:55.150 --> 00:04:04.730
 until my sixteen 16 by either 

00:03:59.030 --> 00:04:07.930
 returned twice each we go 

00:04:04.730 --> 00:04:16.359
 cut right to the center 

00:04:07.930 --> 00:04:16.359
 once younger is twice 

00:04:25.930 --> 00:04:31.389
 here and finally to finish my two 

00:04:28.030 --> 00:04:38.380
 last then I'll leave my 

00:04:31.389 --> 00:04:42.460
 brioche poussier so here I try to 

00:04:38.380 --> 00:04:43.870
 to put my but butt so that it 

00:04:42.460 --> 00:04:47.620
 make a round 

00:04:43.870 --> 00:04:51.729
 I take off of course my father to finish I 

00:04:47.620 --> 00:04:53.440
 let me go m after the 2nd inch of 

00:04:51.729 --> 00:04:55.690
 egg yolk and milk smeared 

00:04:53.440 --> 00:04:58.270
 well the brioche I can put a little 

00:04:55.690 --> 00:04:59.560

00:04:58.270 --> 00:05:01.300
