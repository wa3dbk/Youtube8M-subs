fabric or a white ribbon and it's never

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:45.350 
fabric or a white ribbon and it's never
a<00:00:41.730> good<00:00:41.850> idea<00:00:42.030> so<00:00:42.930> the<00:00:43.350> best<00:00:43.530> idea<00:00:43.800> is<00:00:44.220> to<00:00:44.360> try

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:45.360 
a good idea so the best idea is to try

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:49.040 
a good idea so the best idea is to try
and<00:00:45.500> have<00:00:46.500> white<00:00:47.070> flowers<00:00:47.360> with<00:00:48.360> a<00:00:48.630> dress

and have white flowers with a dress

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:52.040 
and have white flowers with a dress
that's<00:00:49.350> not<00:00:49.950> actually<00:00:50.280> white<00:00:50.760> so<00:00:51.059> if<00:00:51.540> you<00:00:51.750> have

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:52.050 
that's not actually white so if you have

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:54.620 
that's not actually white so if you have
a<00:00:52.469> wedding<00:00:52.829> dress<00:00:53.100> that's<00:00:53.489> ivory<00:00:54.239> and<00:00:54.420> you

is<00:01:22.850> gonna<00:01:23.850> be<00:01:24.000> a<00:01:24.030> range<00:01:24.479> of<00:01:24.810> those<00:01:24.990> whites<00:01:25.290> a

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:25.470 
is gonna be a range of those whites a

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:27.890 
is gonna be a range of those whites a
range<00:01:25.799> of<00:01:26.040> ivories<00:01:26.520> and<00:01:26.549> it<00:01:27.180> also<00:01:27.360> gives<00:01:27.600> it<00:01:27.810> a

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:27.900 
range of ivories and it also gives it a

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:30.170 
range of ivories and it also gives it a
little<00:01:28.049> more<00:01:28.170> texture<00:01:28.820> another<00:01:29.820> thing<00:01:30.060> to

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:30.180 
little more texture another thing to

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:31.910 
little more texture another thing to
consider<00:01:30.360> with<00:01:30.689> white<00:01:30.960> flowers<00:01:31.380> particularly

00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:31.920 
consider with white flowers particularly

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:34.039 
consider with white flowers particularly
in<00:01:32.010> terms<00:01:32.189> of<00:01:32.369> bouquets<00:01:32.850> is<00:01:33.180> that<00:01:33.780> it's<00:01:33.960> a

00:01:34.039 --> 00:01:34.049 
in terms of bouquets is that it's a

00:01:34.049 --> 00:01:36.440 
in terms of bouquets is that it's a
really<00:01:34.409> nice<00:01:34.560> idea<00:01:34.770> to<00:01:35.009> add<00:01:35.250> some<00:01:35.640> pop<00:01:35.970> of<00:01:36.180> some

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:36.450 
really nice idea to add some pop of some

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:39.289 
really nice idea to add some pop of some
color<00:01:36.840> again<00:01:37.470> to<00:01:37.650> give<00:01:37.799> it<00:01:37.920> more<00:01:38.070> texture<00:01:38.520> to

00:01:39.289 --> 00:01:39.299 
color again to give it more texture to

00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:41.120 
color again to give it more texture to
make<00:01:39.479> the<00:01:39.689> bouquet<00:01:40.200> a<00:01:40.229> little<00:01:40.650> more<00:01:40.799> vibrant

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:41.130 
make the bouquet a little more vibrant

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:43.700 
make the bouquet a little more vibrant
and<00:01:41.580> to<00:01:41.640> break<00:01:42.180> up<00:01:42.450> the<00:01:42.960> space<00:01:43.140> a<00:01:43.290> little<00:01:43.560> bit

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:43.710 
and to break up the space a little bit

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:45.710 
and to break up the space a little bit
certainly<00:01:44.340> with<00:01:44.490> centerpieces<00:01:45.090> this<00:01:45.270> is<00:01:45.390> also

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:45.720 
certainly with centerpieces this is also

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:49.880 
certainly with centerpieces this is also
helpful<00:01:46.140> so<00:01:46.909> consider<00:01:47.909> for<00:01:48.390> a<00:01:48.689> white<00:01:49.049> you<00:01:49.770> know

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:49.890 
helpful so consider for a white you know

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:53.060 
helpful so consider for a white you know
an<00:01:50.009> all-white<00:01:50.579> monochromatic<00:01:51.540> look<00:01:52.140> adding<00:01:52.979> a

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:53.070 
an all-white monochromatic look adding a

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:54.649 
an all-white monochromatic look adding a
little<00:01:53.220> bit<00:01:53.340> of<00:01:53.430> purple<00:01:53.790> a<00:01:54.180> little<00:01:54.420> bit<00:01:54.540> of

00:01:54.649 --> 00:01:54.659 
little bit of purple a little bit of

00:01:54.659 --> 00:01:56.300 
little bit of purple a little bit of
gray<00:01:54.960> maybe<00:01:55.439> a<00:01:55.560> little<00:01:55.740> bit<00:01:55.950> of<00:01:56.070> brown

00:01:56.300 --> 00:01:56.310 
gray maybe a little bit of brown

00:01:56.310 --> 00:01:58.880 
gray maybe a little bit of brown
something<00:01:57.000> to<00:01:57.299> give<00:01:57.840> it<00:01:58.020> just<00:01:58.200> a<00:01:58.619> little<00:01:58.650> bit

00:01:58.880 --> 00:01:58.890 
something to give it just a little bit

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:01.550 
something to give it just a little bit
of<00:01:59.070> pop<00:01:59.310> of<00:01:59.579> something<00:01:59.820> and<00:02:00.210> I<00:02:01.079> think<00:02:01.439> you'll

00:02:01.550 --> 00:02:01.560 
of pop of something and I think you'll

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:03.139
