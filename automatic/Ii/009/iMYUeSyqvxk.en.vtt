00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.620
 Hello and welcome to this tutorial 

00:00:02.429 --> 00:00:05.670
 this is already the 18 parties sap 

00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:08.160
 scripting tutorial series 

00:00:05.670 --> 00:00:09.929
 and because it's the video so fast the 150 

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:11.280
 has reached calls comes this video 

00:00:09.929 --> 00:00:13.320
 today and already today 

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:14.610
 youtube released as already in 

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:15.839
 last video is announced in 

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:17.550
 this video is about how we get one 

00:00:15.839 --> 00:00:19.920
 3d text so a little text on the 

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:22.320
 is to enter the center or something 

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:24.510
 our inputs can do or on 

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:25.949
 ours that we have of these 

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:27.500
 easy pick ups just like we did then 

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:29.550
 tags can write on it 

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:31.470
 we go back to ours for that 

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:32.850
 area where we load the buildings and 

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:35.130
 Here we have our parts create 

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:37.440
 pickup around our little ones inside 

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:40.260
 is on the map to generate as on 

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:41.340
 the lab and now we want a 3d 

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:43.800
 add text 

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:51.360
 We do that with the function create 

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:53.100
 3d text label and first we have to 

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:53.820
 now specify what text have 

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:55.410
 want 

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:59.090
 So what should be in there I suppose 

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:59.090
 now just to enter 

00:00:59.480 --> 00:01:04.110
 as a second parameter, this would like 

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:05.670
 features the color we know 

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:09.450
 until now again only one does not take 

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:11.280
 can need red as a third parameter 

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:21.869
 Now specify the iks coordinate as 

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:26.270
 again b info and bex bnp psion and b 

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:26.270
 info bz 

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:33.340
 as four parameters would like this function 

00:01:30.729 --> 00:01:35.710
 have a drop distance that is the 

00:01:33.340 --> 00:01:37.090
 distance from this one this text 

00:01:35.710 --> 00:01:38.439
 that is, if I can see a meter 

00:01:37.090 --> 00:01:39.909
 before standing or if I'm five meters in front of it 

00:01:38.439 --> 00:01:44.649
 stands and we take now just times 

00:01:39.909 --> 00:01:47.950
 10 meters next, then it wants the 

00:01:44.649 --> 00:01:50.409
 Know virtual world and write there 

00:01:47.950 --> 00:01:51.729
 we also have a 0 because we want that 

00:01:50.409 --> 00:01:53.740
 yes, not in a virtual world 

00:01:51.729 --> 00:01:54.280
 but in our world so in ours 

00:01:53.740 --> 00:01:56.619
 world 0 

00:01:54.280 --> 00:01:59.920
 and as last parameter we have to 

00:01:56.619 --> 00:02:02.619
 now indicate whether you are the objects through 

00:01:59.920 --> 00:02:03.310
 whether you pass the text through objects 

00:02:02.619 --> 00:02:05.920
 able to see 

00:02:03.310 --> 00:02:07.270
 then we write 0 or he 

00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:08.789
 to be hidden behind it 

00:02:07.270 --> 00:02:11.410
 then we write a one 

00:02:08.789 --> 00:02:13.720
 brace to and semicolon and us 

00:02:11.410 --> 00:02:15.010
 combine the whole and now we are 

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:18.580
 already finished we can now in 

00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:21.360
 server once so we are here 

00:02:18.580 --> 00:02:24.310
 Connected I think I am ranked 1 

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:27.450
 we build that and we see if we 

00:02:24.310 --> 00:02:27.450
 to run a direction 

00:02:30.739 --> 00:02:37.769
 we see here to enter / center yes 

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:38.879
 the water for this tutorial and that 

00:02:37.769 --> 00:02:40.410
 next tutorial will be either 

00:02:38.879 --> 00:02:42.239
 call at 150 so if you are 

00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:43.739
 wild again and all the video very much 

00:02:42.239 --> 00:02:45.150
 quickly looks then comes the next 

00:02:43.739 --> 00:02:46.700
 tutorial in which we are concerned 

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:49.349
 our shop now with the enter button 

00:02:46.700 --> 00:02:51.599
 that does not work itself 

00:02:49.349 --> 00:02:54.200
 and then you can leave again until then 

00:02:51.599 --> 00:02:54.200
 to the next video
