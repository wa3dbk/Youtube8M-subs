00:00:07.690 --> 00:00:11.629
 there are many processes through which fruits and vegetables pass 

00:00:12.479 --> 00:00:13.440
 from his record 

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:16.919
 and the world until its commercialization 

00:00:16.919 --> 00:00:18.749
 the group fostered serious 

00:00:18.749 --> 00:00:22.549
 designs and builds custom installations tailored to each 

00:00:22.549 --> 00:00:25.150
 client for the perfect treatment 

00:00:25.150 --> 00:00:28.150
 - classification and packaging of fruits and vegetables 

00:00:28.689 --> 00:00:32.680
 covering all the processes that are carried out from the emptying of the 

00:00:32.680 --> 00:00:35.240
 Field boxes until packaging 

00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:39.240
 going through all the intermediate processes from the control booth 

00:00:39.240 --> 00:00:42.460
 we visualize and program all the activity of our line of 

00:00:42.460 --> 00:00:44.710
 classification and packaging 

00:00:44.710 --> 00:00:49.040
 different programs regulate and modify the operation of the compliant line 

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:51.310
 to the needs of the client 

00:00:51.310 --> 00:00:54.310
 one hundred percent design and own technology 

00:00:57.010 --> 00:01:01.340
 research and development are fundamental in the group fomes Saturday 

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:05.539
 the post-harvest laboratories of optical electronic arts inc 

00:01:05.539 --> 00:01:09.079
 kenny hasbrouck constantly develop practical solutions to 

00:01:09.079 --> 00:01:12.079
 the challenges posed day by day 

00:01:13.620 --> 00:01:17.520
 oxxo hoppo fofo 

00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:27.910
 the engineering trade department can also be engaged 

00:01:27.910 --> 00:01:31.070
 fundamentally to the design of solutions implementation 

00:01:31.070 --> 00:01:35.300
 traceability in fruit and vegetable warehouses although it has other 

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:37.560
 actions like the control of loads 

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:42.640
 the control of packaging traceability and girls recalibrate abc city and 

00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:46.770
 optimization of the process control necessary to obtain systems 

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:49.100
 of quality iso 9002 

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:53.710
 and European regulations in force with regard to labeling coding 

00:01:53.710 --> 00:01:57.130
 norms ttp lacko 

00:01:57.130 --> 00:02:01.130
 all traceability projects carried out by empty promises to port 

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:02.740
 they are very big 

00:02:02.740 --> 00:02:06.909
 so the different plots where the implementation process comes are 

00:02:06.909 --> 00:02:07.540
 people 

00:02:07.540 --> 00:02:10.540
 controls and fields control and reception

00:02:16.319 --> 00:02:20.629
 of production ipp control of expeditions roth and control of product 

00:02:20.629 --> 00:02:25.849
 my grandfather although really the only modules needed to complete the 

00:02:25.849 --> 00:02:30.360
 traceability system are campus conception its distribution and 

00:02:30.359 --> 00:02:32.209
 labeling photo 

00:02:32.209 --> 00:02:36.680
 please the group elections is formed by a set of companies 

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:40.650
 innovative and committed to our customers and the fruit and vegetable sector 

00:02:41.859 --> 00:02:45.290
 who teach and build comprehensive systems to get the 

00:02:45.289 --> 00:02:49.639
 food to the consumer in optimal conditions with the same costs 

00:02:49.639 --> 00:02:53.629
 making them more salable and contributing to the rapprochement between 

00:02:53.629 --> 00:02:55.889
 producer and the consumer 

00:02:55.889 --> 00:03:00.239
 for installations of any size and for a wide variety of fruits and 

00:03:00.239 --> 00:03:04.879
 vegetables the foxÃ¡ group we are sure we can offer you the solution 

00:03:04.879 --> 00:03:06.510
