00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
 Oh 

00:00:05.120 --> 00:00:10.200
 if this text conforms and 22 the veil of 

00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:12.660
 glass for walls durably lice 

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:18.690
 with technology to what vitrolles 

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:21.029
 years the supports must be well 

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:23.640
 prepared clean the supports 

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:27.660
 dusty or sandy then apply 

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:29.009
 an impression an impression must 

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:32.640
 also be applied to 

00:00:29.009 --> 00:00:34.620
 strongly absorbent surfaces 

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:36.600
 hydrophobic supports ie the 

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:39.030
 non-absorbent and extremely 

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:41.730
 Smooth must be thought of beforehand 

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:44.250
 the ideal support is a support lice 

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:46.080
 wearing is clean it should 

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:52.350
 comply with the standards in force in the 

00:00:46.080 --> 00:00:54.780
 profession do the following with the 

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:57.120
 machine to which quick pull the winged to 

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:59.010
 through the apparatus filled with water then 

00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:01.470
 fold them in a loop of a length of one 

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:04.860
 meter about the tempera time of the 

00:01:01.470 --> 00:01:06.930
 glue and from one to three minutes for 

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:09.390
 ask the milk first started at the level 

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:10.920
 fittings or edges applied 

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:12.810
 first a width of 5 to 10 

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:15.479
 centimeters so you can 

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:17.820
 still moved the veil once this 

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:20.729
 well posed part apply the rest of the 

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:23.539
 press them and then move up with a 

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:26.100
 spatula to chase air bubbles 

00:01:23.539 --> 00:01:27.630
 a double break break allows you 

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:29.580
 to get perfect joints and 

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:32.370
 invisible 

00:01:29.580 --> 00:01:37.830
 to see it must overlap the 

00:01:32.370 --> 00:01:39.870
 milk already stuck to the wall align the well 

00:01:37.830 --> 00:01:43.830
 stuck with a spatula for 

00:01:39.870 --> 00:01:46.140
 it is well smooth cut with a 

00:01:43.830 --> 00:01:47.940
 cutter at the top edge of the 

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:51.320
 up down both have them 

00:01:47.940 --> 00:01:55.220
 removed first the upper band 

00:01:51.320 --> 00:01:55.220
 then the lower band 

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:03.210
 high school so their agreement wipe 

00:02:01.409 --> 00:02:05.369
 immediately the eventual surplus of 

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:07.829
 glue on the face to paint a 

00:02:05.369 --> 00:02:13.110
 easy and quick operation with the sponge 

00:02:07.829 --> 00:02:14.880
 special if this text for a break at 

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:16.769
 ceiling overlaps the milk at 

00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:20.040
 level of fittings over a width of 5 

00:02:16.769 --> 00:02:23.450
 cm aligned and mounted using a 

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:27.599
 spatula to chase air bubbles 

00:02:23.450 --> 00:02:29.400
 cut in double cut and remove 

00:02:27.599 --> 00:02:31.319
 immediately the eventual surplus of 

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:36.989
 glue at the fitting for a 

00:02:31.319 --> 00:02:40.340
 perfect result do not let the 

00:02:36.989 --> 00:02:40.340
 more than five minutes in batches 

00:02:45.910 --> 00:02:49.890
 it is easy to proceed to 

00:02:47.740 --> 00:02:52.570
 retouching on the wall still wet 

00:02:49.890 --> 00:02:55.440
 stick a new piece of sail a 

00:02:52.570 --> 00:02:58.440
 little bigger than the damaged part 

00:02:55.440 --> 00:02:58.440
 cut 

00:03:07.480 --> 00:03:14.510
 adjust pressed wiped glue on the 

00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:20.810
 face to paint the retouches only sees himself 

00:03:14.510 --> 00:03:23.110
 absolutely not it's easy too 

00:03:20.810 --> 00:03:27.890
 repair an already dry wall 

00:03:23.110 --> 00:03:31.400
 apply a punctuate coating 

00:03:27.890 --> 00:03:33.470
 completed if this comfort text v22 offers 

00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:35.420
 a silica finish after 

00:03:33.470 --> 00:03:37.750
 painting that we do not see any more 

00:03:35.420 --> 00:03:37.750
 retouch 

00:03:38.380 --> 00:03:43.670
 the comparison with an anti is in 

00:03:41.209 --> 00:03:46.220
 conventional cellulose shows that if 

00:03:43.670 --> 00:03:48.470
 this text comfort v22 are cut out more 

00:03:46.220 --> 00:03:50.660
 easily without damaging the edges or 

00:03:48.470 --> 00:03:53.000
 their clothes like cellulose get 

00:03:50.660 --> 00:03:55.970
 retracts easily the joints is seen 

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:58.519
 in general when not wet with six 

00:03:55.970 --> 00:04:00.500
 comfort texts v22 whose stability 

00:03:58.519 --> 00:04:05.150
 dimensional was going to wet and dry 

00:04:00.500 --> 00:04:07.880
 46 invisible fittings if this text 

00:04:05.150 --> 00:04:11.420
 compliant and 22 implementation more 

00:04:07.880 --> 00:04:13.489
 fast surface cutting facility 

00:04:11.420 --> 00:04:17.870
 perfectly smooth and durable in the 

00:04:13.489 --> 00:04:19.970
 time if this text comfort v22 the veil 

00:04:17.870 --> 00:04:23.109
 of glass that incorporates technology to 

00:04:19.970 --> 00:04:23.109
 what two showcases years
