stones and the recent green stones and

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:10.249 
stones and the recent green stones and
these<00:02:07.829> are<00:02:07.979> very<00:02:08.459> aggressive<00:02:09.259> sharpening

00:02:10.249 --> 00:02:10.259 
these are very aggressive sharpening

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:13.580 
these are very aggressive sharpening
stones<00:02:10.619> and<00:02:11.599> I've<00:02:12.599> made<00:02:12.840> so<00:02:13.020> many<00:02:13.050> ends

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:13.590 
stones and I've made so many ends

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:15.410 
stones and I've made so many ends
for<00:02:13.920> the<00:02:13.980> ski<00:02:14.250> sharks<00:02:14.610> over<00:02:14.849> the<00:02:14.970> years<00:02:15.120> some

types of inserts at any particular year

00:02:21.569 --> 00:02:24.170 
types of inserts at any particular year
and<00:02:21.840> I've<00:02:22.680> reduced<00:02:23.069> them<00:02:23.310> all<00:02:23.459> to<00:02:23.670> these<00:02:23.849> three

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:24.180 
and I've reduced them all to these three

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:28.520 
and I've reduced them all to these three
these<00:02:24.540> three<00:02:25.220> are<00:02:26.220> fabulous<00:02:27.209> I<00:02:27.480> am<00:02:27.840> so<00:02:28.319> happy

00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:28.530 
these three are fabulous I am so happy

00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:31.430 
these three are fabulous I am so happy
they<00:02:29.040> do<00:02:29.099> exactly<00:02:29.700> the<00:02:29.910> job<00:02:30.150> I<00:02:30.360> want<00:02:30.660> I<00:02:30.900> have<00:02:31.260> no

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:31.440 
they do exactly the job I want I have no

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:33.770 
they do exactly the job I want I have no
reason<00:02:31.950> to<00:02:31.980> add<00:02:32.250> any<00:02:32.700> complexity<00:02:33.540> to<00:02:33.750> our

00:02:33.770 --> 00:02:33.780 
reason to add any complexity to our

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:37.130 
reason to add any complexity to our
inserts<00:02:34.410> greater<00:02:35.340> than<00:02:35.790> with<00:02:36.540> a<00:02:36.569> job<00:02:36.930> that

00:02:37.130 --> 00:02:37.140 
inserts greater than with a job that

00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:40.220 
inserts greater than with a job that
these<00:02:37.319> three<00:02:37.650> do<00:02:38.510> so<00:02:39.510> this<00:02:39.629> is<00:02:39.690> our<00:02:39.959> C<00:02:40.200> sharp

00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:40.230 
these three do so this is our C sharp

00:02:40.230 --> 00:02:42.979 
these three do so this is our C sharp
tool<00:02:40.739> and<00:02:41.160> I'm<00:02:41.519> telling<00:02:41.819> you<00:02:41.879> this<00:02:42.030> tool<00:02:42.330> is<00:02:42.599> so

00:02:42.979 --> 00:02:42.989 
tool and I'm telling you this tool is so

00:02:42.989 --> 00:02:45.620 
tool and I'm telling you this tool is so
simple<00:02:43.470> and<00:02:43.769> easy<00:02:44.129> to<00:02:44.370> use<00:02:44.400> on<00:02:44.910> the<00:02:45.090> top<00:02:45.330> side

00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:45.630 
simple and easy to use on the top side

00:02:45.630 --> 00:02:48.140 
simple and easy to use on the top side
your<00:02:46.319> bevel<00:02:46.620> selector<00:02:47.280> so<00:02:47.489> you<00:02:47.549> just<00:02:47.790> turn<00:02:48.000> the

00:02:48.140 --> 00:02:48.150 
your bevel selector so you just turn the

00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:50.449 
your bevel selector so you just turn the
knob<00:02:48.180> and<00:02:48.930> you<00:02:49.140> adjust<00:02:49.260> the<00:02:49.650> bevel<00:02:50.010> you<00:02:50.130> want

00:02:50.449 --> 00:02:50.459 
knob and you adjust the bevel you want

00:02:50.459 --> 00:02:53.300 
knob and you adjust the bevel you want
precisely<00:02:50.880> on<00:02:51.209> the<00:02:51.329> ski<00:02:51.599> and<00:02:51.840> you<00:02:52.470> this<00:02:53.069> that's

00:02:53.300 --> 00:02:53.310 
precisely on the ski and you this that's

00:02:53.310 --> 00:02:54.890 
precisely on the ski and you this that's
both<00:02:53.579> the<00:02:53.760> base<00:02:53.970> side<00:02:54.239> of<00:02:54.269> the<00:02:54.420> edge<00:02:54.599> on<00:02:54.810> the

00:02:54.890 --> 00:02:54.900 
both the base side of the edge on the

00:02:54.900 --> 00:02:56.960 
both the base side of the edge on the
side<00:02:55.140> of<00:02:55.170> the<00:02:55.440> act<00:02:55.650> at<00:02:55.799> the<00:02:55.860> same<00:02:56.099> time<00:02:56.400> so<00:02:56.700> each

00:02:56.960 --> 00:02:56.970 
side of the act at the same time so each

00:02:56.970 --> 00:02:59.720 
side of the act at the same time so each
of<00:02:57.030> these<00:02:57.450> have<00:02:57.840> an<00:02:58.110> independent<00:02:58.829> adjustment

00:02:59.720 --> 00:02:59.730 
of these have an independent adjustment

00:02:59.730 --> 00:03:03.110 
of these have an independent adjustment
process<00:03:00.390> so<00:03:01.019> you<00:03:01.110> can<00:03:01.230> run<00:03:01.590> one<00:03:02.489> here<00:03:02.910> and

00:03:03.110 --> 00:03:03.120 
process so you can run one here and

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:05.780 
process so you can run one here and
three<00:03:03.450> there<00:03:03.810> or<00:03:04.049> two<00:03:04.290> here<00:03:04.709> and<00:03:04.739> one<00:03:05.220> here<00:03:05.549> or

00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:05.790 
three there or two here and one here or

00:03:05.790 --> 00:03:08.050 
three there or two here and one here or
you<00:03:06.269> can<00:03:06.420> do<00:03:06.510> it<00:03:06.599> any<00:03:06.750> combination<00:03:07.440> you<00:03:07.590> want

00:03:08.050 --> 00:03:08.060 
you can do it any combination you want

00:03:08.060 --> 00:03:11.300 
you can do it any combination you want
and<00:03:09.060> this<00:03:09.629> will<00:03:09.840> accommodate<00:03:10.170> it<00:03:10.560> on<00:03:11.099> the

00:03:11.300 --> 00:03:11.310 
and this will accommodate it on the

00:03:11.310 --> 00:03:14.449 
and this will accommodate it on the
underside<00:03:11.730> you<00:03:12.360> have<00:03:12.810> files<00:03:13.170> and<00:03:14.040> the<00:03:14.190> files

00:03:14.449 --> 00:03:14.459 
underside you have files and the files

00:03:14.459 --> 00:03:17.870 
underside you have files and the files
have<00:03:14.790> dots<00:03:15.780> of<00:03:16.019> black<00:03:16.260> paint<00:03:16.650> in<00:03:17.250> the<00:03:17.459> forward

00:03:17.870 --> 00:03:17.880 
have dots of black paint in the forward

00:03:17.880 --> 00:03:21.620 
have dots of black paint in the forward
direction<00:03:18.720> and<00:03:18.930> the<00:03:19.680> tool<00:03:19.980> must<00:03:20.639> travel<00:03:21.150> in

00:03:21.620 --> 00:03:21.630 
direction and the tool must travel in

00:03:21.630 --> 00:03:24.920 
direction and the tool must travel in
the<00:03:21.900> in<00:03:22.590> the<00:03:22.769> direction<00:03:22.980> of<00:03:23.459> those<00:03:23.819> dot<00:03:24.269> those

00:03:24.920 --> 00:03:24.930 
the in the direction of those dot those

00:03:24.930 --> 00:03:27.379 
the in the direction of those dot those
black<00:03:25.200> dots<00:03:25.500> because<00:03:26.250> files<00:03:26.730> only<00:03:27.030> cut<00:03:27.359> one

00:03:27.379 --> 00:03:27.389 
black dots because files only cut one

00:03:27.389 --> 00:03:29.690 
black dots because files only cut one
way<00:03:27.660> and<00:03:28.560> if<00:03:28.650> you<00:03:28.769> use<00:03:28.920> them<00:03:29.069> backwards<00:03:29.549> so

00:03:29.690 --> 00:03:29.700 
way and if you use them backwards so

00:03:29.700 --> 00:03:31.069 
way and if you use them backwards so
we're<00:03:29.970> I'm<00:03:30.060> out<00:03:30.209> prematurely

00:03:31.069 --> 00:03:31.079 
we're I'm out prematurely

00:03:31.079 --> 00:03:33.110 
we're I'm out prematurely
so<00:03:31.650> this<00:03:31.950> tells<00:03:32.190> you<00:03:32.400> which<00:03:32.639> way<00:03:32.670> you<00:03:32.880> gotta

00:03:33.110 --> 00:03:33.120 
so this tells you which way you gotta

00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:36.440 
so this tells you which way you gotta
take<00:03:33.359> that<00:03:33.389> turn<00:03:33.989> that<00:03:34.230> to<00:03:34.440> use<00:03:35.220> the<00:03:35.400> tool<00:03:35.579> and

00:03:36.440 --> 00:03:36.450 
take that turn that to use the tool and

00:03:36.450 --> 00:03:38.270 
take that turn that to use the tool and
there's<00:03:36.660> a<00:03:36.720> magnet<00:03:37.200> here<00:03:37.470> if<00:03:37.590> the<00:03:37.859> picks<00:03:38.099> up

00:03:38.270 --> 00:03:38.280 
there's a magnet here if the picks up

00:03:38.280 --> 00:03:40.580 
there's a magnet here if the picks up
filings<00:03:38.940> so<00:03:39.569> they<00:03:39.690> don't<00:03:39.870> get<00:03:39.989> ground<00:03:40.260> in<00:03:40.470> your

00:03:40.580 --> 00:03:40.590 
filings so they don't get ground in your

00:03:40.590 --> 00:03:44.509 
filings so they don't get ground in your
face<00:03:40.889> they're<00:03:41.670> just<00:03:41.880> knobs<00:03:42.120> here<00:03:42.480> to<00:03:42.690> lock<00:03:43.519> the

all<00:04:06.660> you<00:04:06.840> do<00:04:07.019> is<00:04:07.230> you<00:04:07.349> set<00:04:07.590> it<00:04:07.680> on<00:04:07.829> the<00:04:07.980> base<00:04:08.190> and

00:04:08.479 --> 00:04:08.489 
all you do is you set it on the base and

00:04:08.489 --> 00:04:10.940 
all you do is you set it on the base and
slide<00:04:09.000> it<00:04:09.180> over<00:04:09.329> and<00:04:09.780> it's<00:04:09.930> automatically<00:04:10.560> set

00:04:10.940 --> 00:04:10.950 
slide it over and it's automatically set

00:04:10.950 --> 00:04:14.210 
slide it over and it's automatically set
correctly<00:04:11.790> just<00:04:12.239> set<00:04:12.450> it<00:04:12.599> slide<00:04:13.290> it<00:04:13.440> over<00:04:13.620> set

00:04:14.210 --> 00:04:14.220 
correctly just set it slide it over set

00:04:14.220 --> 00:04:17.440 
correctly just set it slide it over set
correctly<00:04:14.900> I'm<00:04:15.900> now<00:04:16.109> using<00:04:16.169> the<00:04:16.620> green<00:04:16.889> stones

00:04:17.440 --> 00:04:17.450 
correctly I'm now using the green stones

00:04:17.450 --> 00:04:20.420 
correctly I'm now using the green stones
which<00:04:18.450> are<00:04:18.630> whether<00:04:18.930> the<00:04:19.139> most<00:04:19.620> typically

00:04:20.420 --> 00:04:20.430 
which are whether the most typically

00:04:20.430 --> 00:04:23.600 
which are whether the most typically
used<00:04:20.760> the<00:04:20.970> inserts<00:04:21.329> in<00:04:21.539> the<00:04:21.570> ski<00:04:22.560> sharp<00:04:22.860> by<00:04:23.400> my

00:04:23.600 --> 00:04:23.610 
used the inserts in the ski sharp by my

00:04:23.610 --> 00:04:26.300 
used the inserts in the ski sharp by my
recommendation<00:04:24.590> yeah<00:04:25.590> I<00:04:25.620> got<00:04:25.979> to<00:04:26.099> show<00:04:26.280> you

00:04:26.300 --> 00:04:26.310 
recommendation yeah I got to show you

00:04:26.310 --> 00:04:27.170 
recommendation yeah I got to show you
that

00:04:27.170 --> 00:04:27.180 
that

00:04:27.180 --> 00:04:30.279 
that
my<00:04:27.600> approach<00:04:27.930> to<00:04:27.990> tuning<00:04:28.919> edges<00:04:29.310> is<00:04:29.490> unique

00:04:30.279 --> 00:04:30.289 
my approach to tuning edges is unique

00:04:30.289 --> 00:04:33.379 
my approach to tuning edges is unique
this<00:04:31.289> is<00:04:31.500> the<00:04:31.620> binding<00:04:31.889> section<00:04:32.580> of<00:04:32.699> the<00:04:32.820> ski<00:04:33.090> I

00:04:33.379 --> 00:04:33.389 
this is the binding section of the ski I

00:04:33.389 --> 00:04:35.300 
this is the binding section of the ski I
remove<00:04:33.810> the<00:04:33.930> bindings<00:04:34.350> on<00:04:34.470> this<00:04:34.680> because<00:04:34.860> I

00:04:35.300 --> 00:04:35.310 
remove the bindings on this because I

00:04:35.310 --> 00:04:38.650 
remove the bindings on this because I
didn't<00:04:36.120> want<00:04:36.240> to<00:04:36.500> make<00:04:37.500> it<00:04:37.590> more<00:04:37.710> cumbersome

00:04:38.650 --> 00:04:38.660 
didn't want to make it more cumbersome

00:04:38.660 --> 00:04:40.820 
didn't want to make it more cumbersome
but<00:04:39.660> this<00:04:39.810> is<00:04:39.930> the<00:04:40.020> binding<00:04:40.199> section<00:04:40.680> of<00:04:40.770> the

00:04:40.820 --> 00:04:40.830 
but this is the binding section of the

00:04:40.830 --> 00:04:47.029 
but this is the binding section of the
ski<00:04:42.949> what<00:04:43.949> I<00:04:43.979> do<00:04:44.130> is<00:04:44.550> I<00:04:44.789> start<00:04:46.009> under<00:04:47.009> the

00:04:47.029 --> 00:04:47.039 
ski what I do is I start under the

00:04:47.039 --> 00:04:49.779 
ski what I do is I start under the
bindings<00:04:47.610> which<00:04:48.539> is<00:04:48.660> basically<00:04:49.110> underfoot

00:04:49.779 --> 00:04:49.789 
bindings which is basically underfoot

00:04:49.789 --> 00:04:52.249 
bindings which is basically underfoot
and<00:04:50.789> I<00:04:50.850> get<00:04:51.090> that<00:04:51.270> start<00:04:51.539> sharpening<00:04:51.810> there

00:04:52.249 --> 00:04:52.259 
and I get that start sharpening there

00:04:52.259 --> 00:04:54.830 
and I get that start sharpening there
and<00:04:52.530> then<00:04:52.800> I<00:04:52.830> work<00:04:53.220> out<00:04:53.520> towards<00:04:54.210> the<00:04:54.330> end<00:04:54.600> of

00:04:54.830 --> 00:04:54.840 
and then I work out towards the end of

00:04:54.840 --> 00:04:57.620 
and then I work out towards the end of
the<00:04:55.020> ski<00:04:55.350> and<00:04:55.710> then<00:04:56.639> same<00:04:56.970> towards<00:04:57.330> the<00:04:57.479> other

00:04:57.620 --> 00:04:57.630 
the ski and then same towards the other

00:04:57.630 --> 00:05:01.339 
the ski and then same towards the other
end<00:04:57.900> of<00:04:57.990> the<00:04:58.110> ski<00:04:58.699> so<00:04:59.699> my<00:04:59.880> concentration<00:05:00.660> of

00:05:01.339 --> 00:05:01.349 
end of the ski so my concentration of

00:05:01.349 --> 00:05:04.879 
end of the ski so my concentration of
sharpening<00:05:02.130> is<00:05:02.449> under<00:05:03.449> the<00:05:03.570> binding<00:05:04.050> with

00:05:04.879 --> 00:05:04.889 
sharpening is under the binding with

00:05:04.889 --> 00:05:07.570 
sharpening is under the binding with
less<00:05:05.130> sharpening<00:05:05.849> as<00:05:06.090> you<00:05:06.810> go<00:05:06.960> further<00:05:07.229> out

00:05:07.570 --> 00:05:07.580 
less sharpening as you go further out

00:05:07.580 --> 00:05:10.129 
less sharpening as you go further out
and<00:05:08.580> then<00:05:08.759> I<00:05:08.849> use<00:05:09.030> the<00:05:09.210> speak<00:05:09.479> the<00:05:09.780> tuning

00:05:10.129 --> 00:05:10.139 
and then I use the speak the tuning

00:05:10.139 --> 00:05:12.860 
and then I use the speak the tuning
stitch<00:05:10.440> constantly<00:05:11.340> to<00:05:12.090> check<00:05:12.360> the<00:05:12.539> progress

00:05:12.860 --> 00:05:12.870 
stitch constantly to check the progress

00:05:12.870 --> 00:05:17.749 
stitch constantly to check the progress
of<00:05:13.500> my<00:05:14.130> work<00:05:15.979> keep<00:05:16.979> in<00:05:17.160> mind<00:05:17.400> when<00:05:17.610> you're

00:05:17.749 --> 00:05:17.759 
of my work keep in mind when you're

00:05:17.759 --> 00:05:20.450 
of my work keep in mind when you're
using<00:05:17.970> stones<00:05:18.539> to<00:05:18.990> tune<00:05:19.259> with<00:05:19.530> that<00:05:20.160> you<00:05:20.310> have

00:05:20.450 --> 00:05:20.460 
using stones to tune with that you have

00:05:20.460 --> 00:05:22.490 
using stones to tune with that you have
to<00:05:20.639> constantly<00:05:21.090> be<00:05:21.539> moving<00:05:21.720> them<00:05:22.050> around<00:05:22.169> in

00:05:22.490 --> 00:05:22.500 
to constantly be moving them around in

00:05:22.500 --> 00:05:24.890 
to constantly be moving them around in
the<00:05:22.620> pockets<00:05:23.130> in<00:05:23.970> order<00:05:24.270> to<00:05:24.360> create<00:05:24.660> more

00:05:24.890 --> 00:05:24.900 
the pockets in order to create more

pocket<00:05:27.870> you<00:05:27.960> want<00:05:28.169> to<00:05:28.259> lift<00:05:28.710> it<00:05:28.889> up<00:05:29.039> a<00:05:29.190> bit

00:05:29.379 --> 00:05:29.389 
pocket you want to lift it up a bit

00:05:29.389 --> 00:05:33.860 
pocket you want to lift it up a bit
because<00:05:30.389> the<00:05:31.229> way<00:05:31.409> stones<00:05:31.770> work<00:05:32.190> is<00:05:32.690> they<00:05:33.690> have

00:05:33.860 --> 00:05:33.870 
because the way stones work is they have

00:05:33.870 --> 00:05:37.270 
because the way stones work is they have

underfoot<00:06:19.259> and<00:06:20.599> working<00:06:21.599> my<00:06:21.750> way<00:06:21.780> net<00:06:22.320> working

00:06:22.670 --> 00:06:22.680 
underfoot and working my way net working

00:06:22.680 --> 00:06:27.050 
underfoot and working my way net working
my<00:06:22.830> way<00:06:22.860> out<00:06:24.320> now<00:06:25.320> why<00:06:25.680> do<00:06:25.740> I<00:06:26.070> do<00:06:26.250> it<00:06:26.580> that<00:06:26.759> way

00:06:27.050 --> 00:06:27.060 
my way out now why do I do it that way

00:06:27.060 --> 00:06:29.649 
my way out now why do I do it that way
there<00:06:27.630> are<00:06:27.810> three<00:06:27.870> reasons<00:06:28.440> actually

00:06:29.649 --> 00:06:29.659 
there are three reasons actually

00:06:29.659 --> 00:06:33.409 
there are three reasons actually
first<00:06:30.659> skis<00:06:31.470> were<00:06:31.770> much<00:06:32.099> faster<00:06:32.699> underfoot

00:06:33.409 --> 00:06:33.419 
first skis were much faster underfoot

00:06:33.419 --> 00:06:36.529 
first skis were much faster underfoot
than<00:06:34.229> they<00:06:34.380> do<00:06:34.440> out<00:06:34.740> towards<00:06:35.159> the<00:06:35.279> ends<00:06:35.520> so<00:06:36.240> the

00:06:36.529 --> 00:06:36.539 
than they do out towards the ends so the

00:06:36.539 --> 00:06:38.290 
than they do out towards the ends so the
underfoot<00:06:37.020> needs<00:06:37.289> more<00:06:37.650> work

00:06:38.290 --> 00:06:38.300 
underfoot needs more work

00:06:38.300 --> 00:06:40.990 
underfoot needs more work
because<00:06:38.479> there's<00:06:38.659> more<00:06:38.900> where<00:06:39.199> their<00:06:40.000> second

00:06:40.990 --> 00:06:41.000 
because there's more where their second

00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:43.059 
because there's more where their second
reason<00:06:41.150> is<00:06:41.449> I<00:06:41.629> like<00:06:42.050> my<00:06:42.259> ski<00:06:42.590> sharper

00:06:43.059 --> 00:06:43.069 
reason is I like my ski sharper

00:06:43.069 --> 00:06:45.430 
reason is I like my ski sharper
underfoot<00:06:43.669> the<00:06:44.150> NAP<00:06:44.360> towards<00:06:44.750> the<00:06:44.870> ends<00:06:45.080> and

00:06:45.430 --> 00:06:45.440 
underfoot the NAP towards the ends and

00:06:45.440 --> 00:06:48.129 
underfoot the NAP towards the ends and
the<00:06:45.530> reason<00:06:45.919> why<00:06:46.129> is<00:06:46.520> this<00:06:47.180> is<00:06:47.360> point<00:06:47.690> loaded

00:06:48.129 --> 00:06:48.139 
the reason why is this is point loaded

00:06:48.139 --> 00:06:50.830 
the reason why is this is point loaded
you<00:06:48.289> are<00:06:48.440> point<00:06:48.860> loading<00:06:49.190> that<00:06:49.550> edge<00:06:49.849> when<00:06:50.750> it

00:06:50.830 --> 00:06:50.840 
you are point loading that edge when it

00:06:50.840 --> 00:06:53.469 
you are point loading that edge when it
interfaces<00:06:51.409> with<00:06:51.800> the<00:06:51.830> with<00:06:52.310> the<00:06:52.460> snow<00:06:52.729> and<00:06:53.060> I

00:06:53.469 --> 00:06:53.479 
interfaces with the with the snow and I

00:06:53.479 --> 00:06:55.930 
interfaces with the with the snow and I
want<00:06:53.810> that<00:06:54.020> point<00:06:54.560> loaded<00:06:54.919> edge<00:06:55.159> to<00:06:55.490> be<00:06:55.520> sharp

00:06:55.930 --> 00:06:55.940 
want that point loaded edge to be sharp

00:06:55.940 --> 00:06:58.330 
want that point loaded edge to be sharp
and<00:06:56.900> I<00:06:57.020> want<00:06:57.229> to<00:06:57.349> be<00:06:57.470> sharper<00:06:57.919> than<00:06:58.039> the<00:06:58.159> rest

00:06:58.330 --> 00:06:58.340 
and I want to be sharper than the rest

00:06:58.340 --> 00:07:00.670 
and I want to be sharper than the rest
of<00:06:58.460> the<00:06:58.550> ski<00:06:58.849> and<00:06:59.120> the<00:06:59.810> third<00:07:00.050> reason<00:07:00.289> is

00:07:00.670 --> 00:07:00.680 
of the ski and the third reason is

00:07:00.680 --> 00:07:03.070 
of the ski and the third reason is
because<00:07:01.190> when<00:07:01.580> you<00:07:01.669> tuned<00:07:01.879> this<00:07:02.060> way<00:07:02.330> it<00:07:02.810> makes

00:07:03.070 --> 00:07:03.080 
because when you tuned this way it makes

00:07:03.080 --> 00:07:07.409 
because when you tuned this way it makes
your<00:07:03.289> skis<00:07:03.879> incredibly<00:07:04.879> quick<00:07:05.210> in<00:07:06.050> the<00:07:06.229> turns

00:07:07.409 --> 00:07:07.419 
your skis incredibly quick in the turns

00:07:07.419 --> 00:07:09.820 
your skis incredibly quick in the turns
now<00:07:08.419> I'm<00:07:08.599> going<00:07:08.780> to<00:07:08.870> tell<00:07:09.080> you<00:07:09.169> why<00:07:09.349> I<00:07:09.379> made<00:07:09.710> the

00:07:09.820 --> 00:07:09.830 
now I'm going to tell you why I made the

00:07:09.830 --> 00:07:11.830 
now I'm going to tell you why I made the
tuning<00:07:10.190> stick<00:07:10.460> I<00:07:10.759> thought<00:07:11.210> about<00:07:11.330> this<00:07:11.780> for

00:07:11.830 --> 00:07:11.840 
tuning stick I thought about this for

00:07:11.840 --> 00:07:14.469 
tuning stick I thought about this for
about<00:07:12.199> 20<00:07:12.650> years<00:07:12.680> before<00:07:13.280> I<00:07:13.520> actually<00:07:13.639> delved

00:07:14.469 --> 00:07:14.479 
about 20 years before I actually delved

00:07:14.479 --> 00:07:17.230 
about 20 years before I actually delved
in<00:07:14.629> and<00:07:14.810> made<00:07:14.990> it<00:07:15.020> and<00:07:15.620> I<00:07:15.740> made<00:07:16.099> it<00:07:16.129> about<00:07:16.490> oh<00:07:16.819> I

00:07:17.230 --> 00:07:17.240 
in and made it and I made it about oh I

00:07:17.240 --> 00:07:18.999 
in and made it and I made it about oh I
was<00:07:17.750> probably<00:07:17.960> about<00:07:18.110> seven<00:07:18.409> or<00:07:18.650> eight<00:07:18.740> years

00:07:18.999 --> 00:07:19.009 
was probably about seven or eight years

00:07:19.009 --> 00:07:22.089 
was probably about seven or eight years
ago<00:07:19.099> and<00:07:19.550> the<00:07:19.729> reason<00:07:20.030> I<00:07:20.389> made<00:07:20.659> it<00:07:20.840> was<00:07:21.139> because

00:07:22.089 --> 00:07:22.099 
ago and the reason I made it was because

00:07:22.099 --> 00:07:24.369 
ago and the reason I made it was because
I<00:07:22.219> needed<00:07:22.370> proof<00:07:23.000> on<00:07:23.240> the<00:07:23.360> bench<00:07:23.629> the<00:07:24.080> tone

00:07:24.369 --> 00:07:24.379 
I needed proof on the bench the tone

00:07:24.379 --> 00:07:27.510 
I needed proof on the bench the tone
that<00:07:24.710> that<00:07:24.979> stones<00:07:25.310> tuned<00:07:26.210> better<00:07:26.569> than<00:07:27.169> files

00:07:27.510 --> 00:07:27.520 
that that stones tuned better than files

00:07:27.520 --> 00:07:30.339 
that that stones tuned better than files
see<00:07:28.520> I<00:07:28.550> could<00:07:28.819> tell<00:07:29.000> you<00:07:29.150> that<00:07:29.330> and<00:07:29.750> you<00:07:30.169> could

00:07:30.339 --> 00:07:30.349 
see I could tell you that and you could

00:07:30.349 --> 00:07:32.290 
see I could tell you that and you could
you<00:07:30.530> do<00:07:30.770> it<00:07:30.860> on<00:07:30.979> your<00:07:31.099> bench<00:07:31.400> but<00:07:31.819> you<00:07:31.940> wouldn't

00:07:32.290 --> 00:07:32.300 
you do it on your bench but you wouldn't

00:07:32.300 --> 00:07:33.879 
you do it on your bench but you wouldn't
know<00:07:32.539> it<00:07:32.750> because<00:07:33.199> you<00:07:33.319> had<00:07:33.469> no<00:07:33.650> way<00:07:33.830> to

00:07:33.879 --> 00:07:33.889 
know it because you had no way to

00:07:33.889 --> 00:07:35.619 
know it because you had no way to
analyze<00:07:34.370> whether<00:07:34.849> that<00:07:35.120> was<00:07:35.300> a<00:07:35.330> true

00:07:35.619 --> 00:07:35.629 
analyze whether that was a true

00:07:35.629 --> 00:07:38.559 
analyze whether that was a true
statement<00:07:35.900> so<00:07:36.680> I<00:07:36.710> made<00:07:36.949> the<00:07:37.069> tuning<00:07:37.490> stick<00:07:37.819> so

00:07:38.559 --> 00:07:38.569 
statement so I made the tuning stick so

00:07:38.569 --> 00:07:40.360 
statement so I made the tuning stick so
that<00:07:38.599> you<00:07:38.900> could<00:07:39.050> see<00:07:39.379> that<00:07:39.979> it<00:07:40.069> was<00:07:40.159> actually

00:07:40.360 --> 00:07:40.370 
that you could see that it was actually

00:07:40.370 --> 00:07:43.180 
that you could see that it was actually
true<00:07:40.879> that<00:07:41.449> stones<00:07:41.780> do<00:07:41.960> an<00:07:42.110> incredible<00:07:42.500> job<00:07:42.770> of

00:07:43.180 --> 00:07:43.190 
true that stones do an incredible job of

00:07:43.190 --> 00:07:46.629 
true that stones do an incredible job of
tuning<00:07:43.520> skis<00:07:44.060> and<00:07:44.860> what<00:07:45.860> actually<00:07:46.039> happened

00:07:46.629 --> 00:07:46.639 
tuning skis and what actually happened

00:07:46.639 --> 00:07:48.129 
tuning skis and what actually happened
was<00:07:46.729> the<00:07:46.969> tuning<00:07:47.270> stick<00:07:47.479> turned<00:07:47.719> out<00:07:47.900> to<00:07:48.020> be

00:07:48.129 --> 00:07:48.139 
was the tuning stick turned out to be

00:07:48.139 --> 00:07:50.649 
was the tuning stick turned out to be
much<00:07:48.349> better<00:07:48.590> than<00:07:48.770> my<00:07:49.069> original<00:07:49.190> plan<00:07:49.699> was<00:07:49.969> my

00:07:50.649 --> 00:07:50.659 
much better than my original plan was my

00:07:50.659 --> 00:07:52.300 
much better than my original plan was my
original<00:07:51.080> plan<00:07:51.259> was<00:07:51.469> just<00:07:51.680> to<00:07:51.770> prove<00:07:51.949> stones

00:07:52.300 --> 00:07:52.310 
original plan was just to prove stones

00:07:52.310 --> 00:07:54.999 
original plan was just to prove stones
tune<00:07:52.610> skis<00:07:53.060> when<00:07:53.630> it<00:07:53.719> turned<00:07:53.930> out<00:07:54.110> this<00:07:54.710> thing

00:07:54.999 --> 00:07:55.009 
tune skis when it turned out this thing

00:07:55.009 --> 00:07:58.120 
tune skis when it turned out this thing
is<00:07:55.430> a<00:07:56.150> communication<00:07:56.990> device<00:07:57.139> exactly<00:07:57.889> about

00:07:58.120 --> 00:07:58.130 
is a communication device exactly about

00:07:58.130 --> 00:08:00.100 
is a communication device exactly about
what<00:07:58.190> your<00:07:58.610> edges<00:07:58.909> are<00:07:59.000> really<00:07:59.180> about<00:07:59.599> it<00:07:59.930> is

00:08:00.100 --> 00:08:00.110 
what your edges are really about it is

00:08:00.110 --> 00:08:02.140 
what your edges are really about it is
an<00:08:00.259> incredible<00:08:00.830> communication<00:08:01.550> device<00:08:01.880> and
