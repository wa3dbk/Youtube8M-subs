front end of the car and probably one of
the<00:02:36.290> first<00:02:36.440> things<00:02:36.710> you'll<00:02:36.890> notice<00:02:36.950> is<00:02:37.310> the

00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:37.430 
the first things you'll notice is the

00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:39.580 
the first things you'll notice is the
absence<00:02:37.940> of<00:02:38.090> shocks<00:02:38.390> well<00:02:38.930> they're<00:02:39.110> there<00:02:39.320> but

00:02:39.580 --> 00:02:39.590 
absence of shocks well they're there but

00:02:39.590 --> 00:02:41.800 
absence of shocks well they're there but
they're<00:02:39.740> inboard<00:02:40.220> shocks<00:02:40.550> which<00:02:41.300> means<00:02:41.600> that

00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:41.810 
they're inboard shocks which means that

00:02:41.810 --> 00:02:43.150 
they're inboard shocks which means that
there<00:02:41.990> is<00:02:42.020> an<00:02:42.230> arm<00:02:42.440> here<00:02:42.770> connect

00:02:43.150 --> 00:02:43.160 
there is an arm here connect

00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:45.490 
there is an arm here connect
into<00:02:43.430> the<00:02:43.580> upper<00:02:43.760> a-arm<00:02:44.180> that<00:02:44.990> comes<00:02:45.260> down

00:02:45.490 --> 00:02:45.500 
into the upper a-arm that comes down

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:48.340 
into the upper a-arm that comes down
attached<00:02:46.130> to<00:02:46.370> a<00:02:46.400> cantilever<00:02:46.990> which<00:02:47.990> in<00:02:48.170> turn

00:02:48.340 --> 00:02:48.350 
attached to a cantilever which in turn

00:02:48.350 --> 00:02:50.740 
attached to a cantilever which in turn
presses<00:02:48.950> up<00:02:49.100> on<00:02:49.310> to<00:02:49.460> a<00:02:49.490> shock<00:02:49.820> creating<00:02:50.600> and

00:02:50.740 --> 00:02:50.750 
presses up on to a shock creating and

00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:54.250 
presses up on to a shock creating and
suspension<00:02:52.390> another<00:02:53.390> thing<00:02:53.690> you'll<00:02:54.080> notice

00:02:54.250 --> 00:02:54.260 
suspension another thing you'll notice

00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:56.710 
suspension another thing you'll notice
is<00:02:54.560> the<00:02:54.740> front<00:02:54.980> end<00:02:55.100> of<00:02:55.160> this<00:02:55.250> car<00:02:55.310> is<00:02:55.730> pretty

00:02:56.710 --> 00:02:56.720 
is the front end of this car is pretty

00:02:56.720 --> 00:02:59.230 
is the front end of this car is pretty
shiny<00:02:56.960> and<00:02:57.490> that<00:02:58.490> was<00:02:58.640> something<00:02:59.030> that<00:02:59.060> was

00:02:59.230 --> 00:02:59.240 
shiny and that was something that was

00:02:59.240 --> 00:03:01.390 
shiny and that was something that was
done<00:02:59.420> afterwards<00:03:00.020> when<00:03:00.800> you<00:03:00.890> bought<00:03:01.070> a<00:03:01.100> car

00:03:01.390 --> 00:03:01.400 
done afterwards when you bought a car

00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:03.040 
done afterwards when you bought a car
like<00:03:01.610> this<00:03:01.760> it<00:03:01.970> would<00:03:02.060> come<00:03:02.240> with<00:03:02.270> a<00:03:02.540> arms<00:03:02.870> that

00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:03.050 
like this it would come with a arms that

00:03:03.050 --> 00:03:05.080 
like this it would come with a arms that
looked<00:03:03.290> like<00:03:03.350> this<00:03:03.620> which<00:03:03.890> were<00:03:04.070> ass<00:03:04.430> and<00:03:04.760> cast

00:03:05.080 --> 00:03:05.090 
looked like this which were ass and cast

00:03:05.090 --> 00:03:08.710 
looked like this which were ass and cast
aluminum<00:03:05.840> part<00:03:06.460> pretty<00:03:07.460> gritty<00:03:07.760> feeling<00:03:08.120> it

00:03:08.710 --> 00:03:08.720 
aluminum part pretty gritty feeling it

00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:10.570 
aluminum part pretty gritty feeling it
takes<00:03:08.960> a<00:03:09.050> lot<00:03:09.260> of<00:03:09.380> sanding<00:03:09.800> and<00:03:09.920> polishing<00:03:10.070> to

00:03:10.570 --> 00:03:10.580 
takes a lot of sanding and polishing to

00:03:10.580 --> 00:03:12.520 
takes a lot of sanding and polishing to
accomplish<00:03:11.090> this<00:03:11.300> look<00:03:11.570> but<00:03:12.110> when<00:03:12.320> done

00:03:12.520 --> 00:03:12.530 
accomplish this look but when done

00:03:12.530 --> 00:03:15.010 
accomplish this look but when done
properly<00:03:12.980> as<00:03:13.190> you<00:03:13.220> can<00:03:13.490> see<00:03:13.670> it's<00:03:14.000> a<00:03:14.330> very<00:03:14.840> nice

00:03:15.010 --> 00:03:15.020 
properly as you can see it's a very nice

00:03:15.020 --> 00:03:18.640 
properly as you can see it's a very nice
