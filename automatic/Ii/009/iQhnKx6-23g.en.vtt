first step in registering extensions to

first step in registering extensions to
your<00:00:21.420> snob<00:00:21.660> phone<00:00:22.050> system<00:00:22.590> is<00:00:22.859> on<00:00:23.160> the<00:00:23.609> server

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:23.970 
your snob phone system is on the server

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:27.170 
your snob phone system is on the server
on<00:00:24.330> the<00:00:24.359> snom<00:00:24.840> one<00:00:25.170> phone<00:00:25.560> server<00:00:25.980> you<00:00:26.939> want<00:00:27.060> to

00:00:27.170 --> 00:00:27.180 
on the snom one phone server you want to

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:31.910 
on the snom one phone server you want to
make<00:00:27.330> sure<00:00:27.890> that<00:00:28.890> the<00:00:30.080> windows<00:00:31.080> firewall<00:00:31.410> is

00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:31.920 
make sure that the windows firewall is

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:35.660 
make sure that the windows firewall is
off<00:00:32.099> so<00:00:32.550> if<00:00:33.420> it's<00:00:33.660> windows<00:00:34.110> 7<00:00:35.100> pro<00:00:35.370> you<00:00:35.430> know

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:35.670 
off so if it's windows 7 pro you know

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:37.660 
off so if it's windows 7 pro you know
where<00:00:35.940> to<00:00:36.030> go<00:00:36.180> to<00:00:36.239> do<00:00:36.540> that<00:00:36.780> turn<00:00:37.140> that<00:00:37.320> off

00:00:37.660 --> 00:00:37.670 
where to go to do that turn that off

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:40.490 
where to go to do that turn that off
it's<00:00:38.670> very<00:00:38.910> easy<00:00:39.090> for<00:00:39.270> extensions<00:00:40.140> to<00:00:40.320> get

00:00:40.490 --> 00:00:40.500 
it's very easy for extensions to get

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:43.010 
it's very easy for extensions to get
stopped<00:00:40.950> by<00:00:41.129> that<00:00:41.190> firewall<00:00:41.910> if<00:00:42.870> you're

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:43.020 
stopped by that firewall if you're

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:44.930 
stopped by that firewall if you're
technically<00:00:43.559> savvy<00:00:43.920> you<00:00:44.190> can<00:00:44.370> figure<00:00:44.579> out<00:00:44.670> how

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:44.940 
technically savvy you can figure out how

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:47.330 
technically savvy you can figure out how
to<00:00:45.000> make<00:00:45.450> it<00:00:45.510> work<00:00:45.629> with<00:00:45.989> it<00:00:46.020> on<00:00:46.289> but<00:00:46.649> for

00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:47.340 
to make it work with it on but for

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:49.190 
to make it work with it on but for
simplicity<00:00:47.550> sake<00:00:48.239> i<00:00:48.420> would<00:00:48.570> suggest<00:00:48.750> turning

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:49.200 
simplicity sake i would suggest turning

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:51.500 
simplicity sake i would suggest turning
it<00:00:49.410> off<00:00:49.590> and<00:00:49.620> then<00:00:50.000> the<00:00:51.000> next<00:00:51.030> thing<00:00:51.270> we<00:00:51.480> want

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:51.510 
it off and then the next thing we want

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:55.300 
it off and then the next thing we want
to<00:00:51.690> do<00:00:51.840> is<00:00:52.020> go<00:00:52.199> into<00:00:52.410> log<00:00:53.039> into<00:00:53.520> the

00:00:55.300 --> 00:00:55.310 
to do is go into log into the
