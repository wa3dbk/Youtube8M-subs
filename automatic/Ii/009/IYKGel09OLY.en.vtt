00:04:10.170 --> 00:04:12.620 
do it in Japanese not very difficult and
I<00:04:10.320> think<00:04:10.350> it's<00:04:10.829> um<00:04:11.160> it's<00:04:11.820> basically<00:04:12.000> the<00:04:12.450> same

00:04:12.620 --> 00:04:12.630 
I think it's um it's basically the same

00:04:12.630 --> 00:04:15.860 
I think it's um it's basically the same
as<00:04:12.840> it<00:04:12.959> would<00:04:13.109> be<00:04:13.260> anywhere<00:04:13.620> else<00:04:14.540> even<00:04:15.540> if<00:04:15.780> it

00:04:15.860 --> 00:04:15.870 
as it would be anywhere else even if it

00:04:15.870 --> 00:04:17.150 
as it would be anywhere else even if it
wasn't<00:04:16.019> English<00:04:16.350> you<00:04:16.470> can<00:04:16.590> basically<00:04:16.739> figure

00:04:17.150 --> 00:04:17.160 
wasn't English you can basically figure

00:04:17.160 --> 00:04:20.270 
wasn't English you can basically figure
it<00:04:17.430> out<00:04:17.549> but<00:04:18.269> for<00:04:18.630> the<00:04:18.780> for<00:04:19.260> the<00:04:19.380> most<00:04:19.650> part<00:04:20.070> I

00:04:20.270 --> 00:04:20.280 
it out but for the for the most part I

00:04:20.280 --> 00:04:24.409 
it out but for the for the most part I
think<00:04:20.700> that<00:04:22.460> for<00:04:23.460> the<00:04:23.550> most<00:04:23.729> part<00:04:23.970> if<00:04:24.060> you<00:04:24.180> want

00:04:24.409 --> 00:04:24.419 
think that for the most part if you want

00:04:24.419 --> 00:04:25.730 
think that for the most part if you want
a<00:04:24.479> phone<00:04:24.690> that's<00:04:24.900> going<00:04:25.020> to<00:04:25.080> be<00:04:25.200> a<00:04:25.410> hundred

00:04:25.730 --> 00:04:25.740 
a phone that's going to be a hundred

00:04:25.740 --> 00:04:26.670 
a phone that's going to be a hundred
percent<00:04:25.890> Amer

00:04:26.670 --> 00:04:26.680 
percent Amer

00:04:26.680 --> 00:04:28.890 
percent Amer
and<00:04:26.889> friendly<00:04:27.280> or<00:04:27.490> English<00:04:28.449> friendly

00:04:28.890 --> 00:04:28.900 
and friendly or English friendly

00:04:28.900 --> 00:04:32.210 
and friendly or English friendly
switches<00:04:29.650> and<00:04:29.800> I<00:04:29.830> think<00:04:30.039> this<00:04:30.400> is<00:04:30.520> the<00:04:30.669> the

00:04:32.210 --> 00:04:32.220 
switches and I think this is the the

00:04:32.220 --> 00:04:35.969 
switches and I think this is the the
spectral<00:04:33.220> magic<00:04:33.610> calendar<00:04:34.650> if<00:04:35.650> you<00:04:35.800> want

something that's gonna be a hundred

00:04:36.970 --> 00:04:39.689 
something that's gonna be a hundred
percent<00:04:37.199> American<00:04:38.199> English<00:04:38.699> whatever

00:06:16.960 --> 00:06:19.710 
missing there's a lot of apps on here
and<00:06:17.139> I'm<00:06:17.199> not<00:06:17.320> sure<00:06:17.380> exactly<00:06:18.030> how<00:06:19.030> to<00:06:19.090> use<00:06:19.270> them

00:06:19.710 --> 00:06:19.720 
and I'm not sure exactly how to use them

00:06:19.720 --> 00:06:23.310 
and I'm not sure exactly how to use them
or<00:06:20.909> at<00:06:21.909> Fir<00:06:22.150> it<00:06:22.330> took<00:06:22.479> me<00:06:22.599> a<00:06:22.630> while<00:06:22.870> to<00:06:22.930> figure

00:06:23.310 --> 00:06:23.320 
or at Fir it took me a while to figure

00:06:23.320 --> 00:06:25.649 
or at Fir it took me a while to figure
out<00:06:23.530> how<00:06:23.740> to<00:06:23.800> get<00:06:24.130> to<00:06:24.430> the<00:06:24.550> place<00:06:24.789> where<00:06:25.150> I<00:06:25.180> can

00:06:25.649 --> 00:06:25.659 
out how to get to the place where I can

00:06:25.659 --> 00:06:28.589 
out how to get to the place where I can
actually<00:06:26.400> set<00:06:27.400> up<00:06:27.430> different<00:06:28.240> Disney

00:06:28.589 --> 00:06:28.599 
actually set up different Disney

00:06:28.599 --> 00:06:30.420 
actually set up different Disney
backgrounds<00:06:29.229> because<00:06:29.590> I<00:06:29.620> didn't<00:06:30.099> realize<00:06:30.340> I

00:06:30.420 --> 00:06:30.430 
backgrounds because I didn't realize I

00:06:30.430 --> 00:06:33.089 
backgrounds because I didn't realize I
had<00:06:30.460> to<00:06:30.699> register<00:06:30.880> for<00:06:31.360> Disney<00:06:31.780> and<00:06:32.099> because

00:06:33.089 --> 00:06:33.099 
had to register for Disney and because

00:06:33.099 --> 00:06:36.330 
had to register for Disney and because
it<00:06:33.190> was<00:06:33.280> all<00:06:33.370> in<00:06:33.490> Japanese<00:06:33.639> and<00:06:35.099> it<00:06:36.099> just

00:06:36.330 --> 00:06:36.340 
it was all in Japanese and it just

00:06:36.340 --> 00:06:37.560 
it was all in Japanese and it just
wasn't<00:06:36.490> making<00:06:36.700> sense<00:06:36.849> to<00:06:37.150> me<00:06:37.210> it<00:06:37.300> took<00:06:37.360> me<00:06:37.510> a

00:06:37.560 --> 00:06:37.570 
wasn't making sense to me it took me a

00:06:37.570 --> 00:06:38.990 
wasn't making sense to me it took me a
little<00:06:37.630> while<00:06:37.750> to<00:06:37.840> figure<00:06:38.080> out<00:06:38.289> it's<00:06:38.710> not

00:06:38.990 --> 00:06:39.000 
little while to figure out it's not

00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:40.760 
little while to figure out it's not
thing<00:06:39.090> that<00:06:39.210> you<00:06:39.270> can't<00:06:39.630> figure<00:06:39.900> out<00:06:40.110> if<00:06:40.560> I

00:06:40.760 --> 00:06:40.770 
thing that you can't figure out if I

00:06:40.770 --> 00:06:42.440 
thing that you can't figure out if I
didn't<00:06:41.130> know<00:06:41.280> a<00:06:41.550> little<00:06:41.820> bit<00:06:42.000> of<00:06:42.090> Japanese

00:06:42.440 --> 00:06:42.450 
didn't know a little bit of Japanese

00:06:42.450 --> 00:06:44.600

here<00:06:42.690> and<00:06:42.810> there<00:06:42.960> it<00:06:43.230> might<00:06:43.770> have<00:06:43.980> been<00:06:44.250> more

00:06:44.600 --> 00:06:44.610

really only 3d if you look at it

00:07:42.510 --> 00:07:45.980 
really only 3d if you look at it
straight<00:07:42.690> forward<00:07:43.080> so<00:07:43.890> um<00:07:44.660> but<00:07:45.660> either<00:07:45.780> way
