00:00:42.119 --> 00:00:42.129 
you say that boys are motivated in

you say that boys are motivated in
different<00:00:42.430> ways<00:00:42.550> from<00:00:42.760> girls<00:00:43.089> so<00:00:43.449> what

00:00:43.619 --> 00:00:43.629 
different ways from girls so what

00:00:43.629 --> 00:00:45.119 
different ways from girls so what
exactly<00:00:43.720> do<00:00:44.110> you<00:00:44.170> mean<00:00:44.229> by<00:00:44.530> that

exactly do you mean by that

00:00:45.129 --> 00:00:47.880 
exactly do you mean by that
well<00:00:45.790> the<00:00:46.149> differences<00:00:46.780> in<00:00:47.079> cognition<00:00:47.769> that

00:00:47.880 --> 00:00:47.890 
well the differences in cognition that

00:00:47.890 --> 00:00:49.439 
well the differences in cognition that
is<00:00:47.949> differences<00:00:48.549> in<00:00:48.670> how<00:00:48.820> girls<00:00:49.089> and<00:00:49.269> boys

00:00:49.439 --> 00:00:49.449 
is differences in how girls and boys

00:00:49.449 --> 00:00:51.899 
is differences in how girls and boys
think<00:00:49.989> or<00:00:50.680> learn<00:00:51.009> turned<00:00:51.430> out<00:00:51.489> to<00:00:51.610> be<00:00:51.729> very

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:51.909 
think or learn turned out to be very

00:00:51.909 --> 00:00:54.210 
think or learn turned out to be very
small<00:00:52.360> almost<00:00:52.629> trivial<00:00:53.080> but<00:00:53.769> what's<00:00:53.979> really

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:54.220 
small almost trivial but what's really

00:00:54.220 --> 00:00:56.009 
small almost trivial but what's really
dramatically<00:00:54.820> different<00:00:55.269> between<00:00:55.570> girls<00:00:55.930> and

00:00:56.009 --> 00:00:56.019 
dramatically different between girls and

00:00:56.019 --> 00:00:57.899 
dramatically different between girls and
boys<00:00:56.229> especially<00:00:56.619> amongst<00:00:57.549> the<00:00:57.670> younger

00:00:57.899 --> 00:00:57.909 
boys especially amongst the younger

00:00:57.909 --> 00:01:00.780 
boys especially amongst the younger
children<00:00:58.269> is<00:00:58.890> what<00:00:59.890> they<00:01:00.040> want<00:01:00.280> to<00:01:00.430> do<00:01:00.580> the

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:00.790 
children is what they want to do the

00:01:00.790 --> 00:01:02.369 
children is what they want to do the
differences<00:01:01.180> are<00:01:01.329> not<00:01:01.360> in<00:01:01.600> what<00:01:01.750> they<00:01:01.869> can<00:01:02.140> do

00:01:02.369 --> 00:01:02.379 
differences are not in what they can do

00:01:02.379 --> 00:01:04.289 
differences are not in what they can do
but<00:01:02.890> in<00:01:03.009> what<00:01:03.159> they<00:01:03.280> want<00:01:03.519> to<00:01:03.670> do<00:01:03.790> the<00:01:03.970> best<00:01:04.119> way

00:01:04.289 --> 00:01:04.299 
but in what they want to do the best way

00:01:04.299 --> 00:01:06.300 
but in what they want to do the best way
to<00:01:04.329> get<00:01:04.540> boys<00:01:04.720> excited<00:01:05.439> about<00:01:05.680> learning<00:01:05.890> is

00:01:06.300 --> 00:01:06.310 
to get boys excited about learning is

00:01:06.310 --> 00:01:08.039 
to get boys excited about learning is
very<00:01:06.880> different<00:01:07.299> than<00:01:07.420> the<00:01:07.479> best<00:01:07.689> way<00:01:07.840> to<00:01:07.869> get

00:01:08.039 --> 00:01:08.049 
very different than the best way to get

00:01:08.049 --> 00:01:09.719 
very different than the best way to get
girls<00:01:08.350> excited<00:01:08.680> about<00:01:09.040> learning<00:01:09.220> give<00:01:09.610> me

00:01:09.719 --> 00:01:09.729 
girls excited about learning give me

00:01:09.729 --> 00:01:11.700 
girls excited about learning give me
some<00:01:09.880> examples<00:01:10.420> in<00:01:10.570> well<00:01:11.110> a<00:01:11.140> very<00:01:11.350> simple

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:11.710 
some examples in well a very simple

00:01:11.710 --> 00:01:14.130 
some examples in well a very simple
example<00:01:11.799> is<00:01:12.340> standing<00:01:12.850> versus<00:01:13.180> sitting<00:01:13.570> we

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:14.140 
example is standing versus sitting we

00:01:14.140 --> 00:01:15.440 
example is standing versus sitting we
now<00:01:14.259> have<00:01:14.470> lots<00:01:14.710> of<00:01:14.860> evidence<00:01:15.040> that

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:15.450 
now have lots of evidence that

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:18.210 
now have lots of evidence that
six-year-old<00:01:16.450> boys<00:01:16.659> for<00:01:17.170> example<00:01:17.560> many<00:01:18.130> of

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:18.220 
six-year-old boys for example many of

00:01:18.220 --> 00:01:19.950 
six-year-old boys for example many of
them<00:01:18.399> learn<00:01:18.640> better<00:01:18.670> when<00:01:19.509> they're<00:01:19.689> standing

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:19.960 
them learn better when they're standing

00:01:19.960 --> 00:01:21.630 
them learn better when they're standing
if<00:01:20.320> you<00:01:20.350> ask<00:01:20.650> them<00:01:20.800> to<00:01:20.860> sit<00:01:21.159> still<00:01:21.400> and<00:01:21.460> be

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:21.640 
if you ask them to sit still and be

00:01:21.640 --> 00:01:23.520 
if you ask them to sit still and be
quiet<00:01:21.670> as<00:01:22.060> one<00:01:22.210> teacher<00:01:22.390> said<00:01:22.510> to<00:01:22.690> me<00:01:22.870> she<00:01:23.500> said

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:23.530 
quiet as one teacher said to me she said

00:01:23.530 --> 00:01:25.830 
quiet as one teacher said to me she said
when<00:01:23.860> that<00:01:23.979> boy<00:01:24.159> sits<00:01:24.490> down<00:01:24.700> his<00:01:25.180> brain<00:01:25.510> shuts

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:25.840 
when that boy sits down his brain shuts

00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:28.380 
when that boy sits down his brain shuts
off<00:01:26.050> and<00:01:26.770> these<00:01:27.340> boys<00:01:27.520> are<00:01:27.670> sitting<00:01:28.090> there<00:01:28.210> not

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:28.390 
off and these boys are sitting there not

00:01:28.390 --> 00:01:30.390 
off and these boys are sitting there not

especially<00:01:30.880> these<00:01:31.000> boys<00:01:31.240> are<00:01:31.390> likely<00:01:31.659> to<00:01:31.750> be

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:31.870 
especially these boys are likely to be

00:01:31.870 --> 00:01:33.420 
especially these boys are likely to be
diagnosed<00:01:32.290> with<00:01:32.470> attention<00:01:32.620> deficit

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:33.430 
diagnosed with attention deficit

00:01:33.430 --> 00:01:35.430

medications what these boys need is not

00:01:37.870 --> 00:01:39.899 
medications what these boys need is not
medications<00:01:38.530> but<00:01:39.010> teachers<00:01:39.340> who<00:01:39.490> know<00:01:39.700> how<00:01:39.880> to

teach<00:01:40.120> boys<00:01:40.420> it<00:01:40.900> can<00:01:41.080> come<00:01:41.260> down<00:01:41.440> to<00:01:41.590> things

00:01:41.789 --> 00:01:41.799 
teach boys it can come down to things

00:01:41.799 --> 00:01:43.770 
teach boys it can come down to things
like<00:01:41.979> lighting<00:01:42.310> and<00:01:42.850> the<00:01:43.030> temperature<00:01:43.570> of<00:01:43.690> a

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:45.610 
room as well indeed there's a very
