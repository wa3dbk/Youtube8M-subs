fructose<00:00:37.920> corn<00:00:38.190> syrup<00:00:38.579> um<00:00:39.590> actually<00:00:40.590> that's

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:40.920 
fructose corn syrup um actually that's

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:43.369 
fructose corn syrup um actually that's
not<00:00:41.570> uncharacteristic<00:00:42.570> for<00:00:42.780> me<00:00:42.899> for<00:00:43.260> the

00:00:43.369 --> 00:00:43.379 
not uncharacteristic for me for the

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:45.459 
not uncharacteristic for me for the
taste<00:00:43.620> of<00:00:43.800> something<00:00:44.040> that's<00:00:44.399> bad<00:00:44.850> for<00:00:45.270> me

00:00:45.459 --> 00:00:45.469 
taste of something that's bad for me

00:00:45.469 --> 00:00:48.680 
taste of something that's bad for me
yeah<00:00:46.469> so<00:00:47.250> I<00:00:47.280> thought<00:00:47.670> I'd<00:00:47.820> do<00:00:47.940> a<00:00:47.969> blind<00:00:48.510> taste

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:48.690 
yeah so I thought I'd do a blind taste

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:50.720 
yeah so I thought I'd do a blind taste
test<00:00:49.200> unfortunately<00:00:50.010> unlike<00:00:50.280> the<00:00:50.489> previous

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:50.730 
test unfortunately unlike the previous

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:53.060 
test unfortunately unlike the previous
two<00:00:51.149> blind<00:00:51.449> taste<00:00:51.750> tests<00:00:52.199> that<00:00:52.320> I<00:00:52.500> have<00:00:52.649> a<00:00:52.770> shot

00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:53.070 
two blind taste tests that I have a shot

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:56.150 
two blind taste tests that I have a shot
well<00:00:53.820> I<00:00:54.090> shot<00:00:54.870> two<00:00:55.020> of<00:00:55.140> them<00:00:55.320> all<00:00:55.469> only<00:00:55.739> one<00:00:56.039> is

00:00:56.150 --> 00:00:56.160 
well I shot two of them all only one is

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:59.270

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:37.140 

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:41.910 

if<00:01:38.140> you<00:01:38.440> find<00:01:38.710> your<00:01:39.130> hands<00:01:40.000> and<00:01:40.740> underarms<00:01:41.740> are

if you find your hands and underarms are

00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:51.740 
if you find your hands and underarms are
bleeding<00:01:42.540> fear<00:01:43.540> might<00:01:44.500> not<00:01:44.770> have<00:01:45.160> a<00:01:45.190> twist<00:01:45.550> on

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:51.750 

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:55.710 

this<00:01:52.750> time<00:01:53.020> I<00:01:53.110> open<00:01:53.500> the<00:01:53.560> glass<00:01:53.770> and<00:01:54.630> doing<00:01:55.630> it

00:01:55.710 --> 00:01:55.720 
this time I open the glass and doing it

00:01:55.720 --> 00:01:57.960 
this time I open the glass and doing it
while<00:01:55.900> looking<00:01:55.930> into<00:01:56.380> a<00:01:56.530> tiny<00:01:57.070> camera<00:01:57.460> screen

00:01:57.960 --> 00:01:57.970 
while looking into a tiny camera screen

00:01:57.970 --> 00:01:59.940 
while looking into a tiny camera screen
so<00:01:58.300> it'll<00:01:58.510> probably<00:01:58.720> still<00:01:59.140> over<00:01:59.680> flower

00:01:59.940 --> 00:01:59.950 
so it'll probably still over flower

00:01:59.950 --> 00:02:12.030 
so it'll probably still over flower

in<00:02:20.320> between<00:02:20.680> i<00:02:20.709> have<00:02:21.130> this<00:02:21.540> cooler<00:02:22.620> experts

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:23.620 
in between i have this cooler experts

00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:27.330 
in between i have this cooler experts
are<00:02:24.330> not<00:02:25.330> only<00:02:25.690> denied<00:02:26.040> almost<00:02:27.040> certainly

00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:27.340 
are not only denied almost certainly

00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:29.010 
are not only denied almost certainly
scale<00:02:27.790> yeah<00:02:28.060> it's<00:02:28.390> probably<00:02:28.630> just<00:02:28.900> a

00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:29.020 
scale yeah it's probably just a

00:02:29.020 --> 00:02:32.210 
scale yeah it's probably just a
guideline<00:02:29.280> so<00:02:30.280> kind<00:02:30.670> of<00:02:30.790> lined<00:02:31.000> for<00:02:31.180> myself<00:02:31.660> um

00:02:32.210 --> 00:02:32.220 
guideline so kind of lined for myself um

00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:43.059 
guideline so kind of lined for myself um
as<00:02:33.220> it's<00:02:33.820> almost<00:02:33.940> enough<00:02:34.300> to<00:02:34.510> do<00:02:34.630> it

00:02:43.059 --> 00:02:43.069 

00:02:43.069 --> 00:02:51.290 

he<00:02:44.069> wore<00:02:44.670> a<00:02:44.700> boom<00:02:47.090> unfold<00:02:49.190> it<00:02:50.190> wasn't<00:02:50.610> velvet

00:02:51.290 --> 00:02:51.300 
he wore a boom unfold it wasn't velvet

00:02:51.300 --> 00:02:56.770 
he wore a boom unfold it wasn't velvet
it<00:02:51.660> was<00:02:51.840> cloth<00:02:53.810> okay<00:02:54.810> so<00:02:54.870> velvet<00:02:55.709> is<00:02:56.010> a<00:02:56.040> cloth

00:02:56.770 --> 00:02:56.780 
it was cloth okay so velvet is a cloth

00:02:56.780 --> 00:03:04.190 
it was cloth okay so velvet is a cloth
but<00:02:57.780> who<00:02:58.290> cares<00:03:00.860> maybe<00:03:01.860> I<00:03:02.760> shouldn't<00:03:03.690> make<00:03:03.930> up

00:03:04.190 --> 00:03:04.200 
but who cares maybe I shouldn't make up

00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:11.559 
but who cares maybe I shouldn't make up
