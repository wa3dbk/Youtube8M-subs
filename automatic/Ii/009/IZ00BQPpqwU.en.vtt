 they are those that we already have two are the 

00:00:06.549 --> 00:00:09.120
 shaking 

00:00:10.140 --> 00:00:18.830
 they are even seen for the portfolios that 

00:00:14.100 --> 00:00:21.350
 they are shadows executed 

00:00:18.830 --> 00:00:23.690
 for this footprint 

00:00:21.350 --> 00:00:29.480
 A) Yes 

00:00:23.690 --> 00:00:29.480
 during a promotion session 

00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:40.860
 stanford when from formosa 

00:00:35.470 --> 00:00:40.860
 they are two minimums 

00:00:44.810 --> 00:00:46.930
 today 

00:00:49.560 --> 00:00:52.070
 or not 

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:58.500
 a moment since we are with a 

00:00:55.230 --> 00:01:00.359
 new video this time is a I do not know what the 

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:02.070
 starting exactly I know that they are more than 

00:01:00.359 --> 00:01:04.860
 110 casualties playing only in war 

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:06.630
 terrestrial background game because I say 

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:08.430
 background since good the previous video 

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:10.890
 that I went up call of duty, I did not focus on 

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:12.690
 what is said game but said better 

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:15.930
 in what is the comment and what I saw 

00:01:12.690 --> 00:01:18.570
 that you liked that you liked so 

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:20.310
 I asked in that video if you wanted me to 

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:21.570
 this kind of it was him 

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:23.369
 explaining the things that are on youtube 

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:25.470
 for new people 

00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:28.350
 his molaba the theme of how to grow in 

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:30.869
 youtube as for example we pay them the 

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:32.130
 way to promote yourself and that and the monkey 

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:33.899
 the idea since the previous video os 

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:35.729
 really liked it and in these I'm going to 

00:01:33.899 --> 00:01:37.740
 rethink if it's cool for you in the 

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:39.420
 next video talk about everything that 

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:41.640
 move moves inside youtube either 

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:43.440
 the mafia whether the friends be it whatever 

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:44.970
 that changes people because this 

00:01:43.440 --> 00:01:46.740
 change the people I tell you I 

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:48.060
 it's a pretty interesting topic, I think 

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:50.700
 that if you're cool I could talk in the 

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:52.530
 next video restated it and good 

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:54.030
 we go there my advice to grow in 

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:55.770
 youtube how to offer more ways 

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:57.360
 easy the most difficult forms and 

00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:58.800
 the most effective 

00:01:57.360 --> 00:02:03.960
 well the first of all in which 

00:01:58.800 --> 00:02:05.880
 we all know call spam the way 

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:08.619
 I will be sincere is one of the ways 

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:10.569
 I grew up with 

00:02:08.619 --> 00:02:12.190
 I'm sorry those who are not subscribed by 

00:02:10.569 --> 00:02:14.739
 me to space I started with foam up 

00:02:12.190 --> 00:02:16.540
 the 3 thousand subscribers I think it was and 

00:02:14.739 --> 00:02:18.370
 he got them pretty fast in out 

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:20.310
 two months thanks to spam 

00:02:18.370 --> 00:02:22.900
 it was quite spamming things like they are 

00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:24.879
 the spam that is spam the spam is 

00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:25.360
 get into a channel of another say in 

00:02:24.879 --> 00:02:26.680
 Youtube 

00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:28.599
 I am now talking about youtube in a 

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:30.700
 another channel and announce your channel to go 

00:02:28.599 --> 00:02:32.829
 saying the content that you upload annoys 

00:02:30.700 --> 00:02:35.860
 yes and I will never understand why I 

00:02:32.829 --> 00:02:37.750
 It bothers having annoyed I understand that 

00:02:35.860 --> 00:02:39.670
 bother if you do it a lot and very 

00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:41.019
 next but once to me what 

00:02:39.670 --> 00:02:42.489
 do for example if at least they have a 

00:02:41.019 --> 00:02:44.079
 video one and I do it maybe a 

00:02:42.489 --> 00:02:46.030
 once a week or something like that 

00:02:44.079 --> 00:02:48.549
 I leave and I'm not going to erase it 

00:02:46.030 --> 00:02:50.500
 this works how it is that people see it 

00:02:48.549 --> 00:02:52.120
 like on television one thing is for 

00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:54.340
 example you are on the air3 you put on 

00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:57.280
 antena3 to announce it 4 is worth that yes 

00:02:54.340 --> 00:03:00.099
 it steals audiences but here I do not know 

00:02:57.280 --> 00:03:01.989
 What else does the community see when spamming 

00:03:00.099 --> 00:03:04.930
 moderate spam could you say spam 

00:03:01.989 --> 00:03:08.109
 massive that is to get swollen to cocks 

00:03:04.930 --> 00:03:09.489
 there in vinegar, spam is that way 

00:03:08.109 --> 00:03:10.600
 walesa then it is one of the ways of 

00:03:09.489 --> 00:03:12.520
 grow 

00:03:10.600 --> 00:03:14.320
 another one of the many ways is to have 

00:03:12.520 --> 00:03:16.480
 lucky luck I mean to be the 

00:03:14.320 --> 00:03:18.580
 first to upload things to be the 

00:03:16.480 --> 00:03:20.080
 first to find something 

00:03:18.580 --> 00:03:22.870
 different than just the people what 

00:03:20.080 --> 00:03:24.310
 search because there was not appreciated some new 

00:03:22.870 --> 00:03:26.590
 in some game you are the first one what 

00:03:24.310 --> 00:03:28.720
 you go up you've had the luck and that's the 

00:03:26.590 --> 00:03:31.780
 Fortunately very few people it happens to him 

00:03:28.720 --> 00:03:33.100
 I have many cases of friends that good 

00:03:31.780 --> 00:03:34.540
 youtube is changing them to how they were 

00:03:33.100 --> 00:03:36.970
 at the beginning I will talk about whether that in the 

00:03:34.540 --> 00:03:39.250
 next video the following way is the 

00:03:36.970 --> 00:03:42.040
 to promote go go you go to a channel 

00:03:39.250 --> 00:03:44.680
 a little bit bigger than you talk to him 

00:03:42.040 --> 00:03:46.420
 so and so and he uploads a video of yours to his 

00:03:44.680 --> 00:03:48.100
 channel or a video of him talking about you 

00:03:46.420 --> 00:03:50.350
 this form is also more difficult since 

00:03:48.100 --> 00:03:51.490
 good people I promote from time to time 

00:03:50.350 --> 00:03:52.900
 when, but when people are very 

00:03:51.490 --> 00:03:56.500
 great I can not promote because 

00:03:52.900 --> 00:03:58.150
 have too much public and if 

00:03:56.500 --> 00:04:00.220
 wants to promote everyone because you can 

00:03:58.150 --> 00:04:02.380
 die can die 

00:04:00.220 --> 00:04:05.590
 to promote everyone and it becomes very 

00:04:02.380 --> 00:04:10.540
 heavy then I do not shit on the 

00:04:05.590 --> 00:04:11.920
 fucking guasa whore pussy up her boobs is 

00:04:10.540 --> 00:04:14.530
 good the truth that I am happy 

00:04:11.920 --> 00:04:19.329
 lately I do not know suddenly so good 

00:04:14.530 --> 00:04:21.609
 now let's leave it to the good case that 

00:04:19.329 --> 00:04:24.139
 way not to promote next 

00:04:21.609 --> 00:04:26.659
 way to grow on this from youtube 

00:04:24.139 --> 00:04:30.110
 already explained the spam the promotion and the 

00:04:26.659 --> 00:04:31.730
 luck now the likes 

00:04:30.110 --> 00:04:34.720
 for what you do not know what are the 

00:04:31.730 --> 00:04:34.720
 likes for people 

00:04:34.849 --> 00:04:39.679
 to me for example is a video on twitter 

00:04:37.909 --> 00:04:41.599
 I do not have the description to follow me 

00:04:39.679 --> 00:04:43.999
 because it is very important that too 

00:04:41.599 --> 00:04:45.589
 now I will explain it and if it happens it is 

00:04:43.999 --> 00:04:47.029
 a video put a special or something and me 

00:04:45.589 --> 00:04:49.399
 I like I 'm going to give you the retweet and I 

00:04:47.029 --> 00:04:50.659
 I will give a like if I give a like 

00:04:49.399 --> 00:04:52.219
 they will see all those who are subscribed 

00:04:50.659 --> 00:04:52.789
 to my channel and everyone who follows me 

00:04:52.219 --> 00:04:54.589
 twitter 

00:04:52.789 --> 00:04:56.059
 Then you can help the best if 

00:04:54.589 --> 00:04:57.889
 you are going to 10 subscribers then if 

00:04:56.059 --> 00:04:59.300
 you have some special video send it to him 

00:04:57.889 --> 00:05:01.279
 always to the big people of 20,000 

00:04:59.300 --> 00:05:02.689
 subscribers something so if you sneak 

00:05:01.279 --> 00:05:04.969
 they can put a like of once in 

00:05:02.689 --> 00:05:07.789
 when and if they get 20 subscribers are 

00:05:04.969 --> 00:05:09.949
 20 subscribers fuck is that you have to 

00:05:07.789 --> 00:05:11.580
 think those little things that seem not to 

00:05:09.949 --> 00:05:14.039
 but help 

00:05:11.580 --> 00:05:17.180
 because said twitter twitter what 

00:05:14.039 --> 00:05:19.229
 he named because he also helps you grow 

00:05:17.180 --> 00:05:21.210
 not to grow but to have more 

00:05:19.229 --> 00:05:22.560
 audience since when you upload a video 

00:05:21.210 --> 00:05:24.539
 it is reflected on twitter and also 

00:05:22.560 --> 00:05:25.740
 happens on facebook then I encourage you to 

00:05:24.539 --> 00:05:27.930
 all that you start that you leave a 

00:05:25.740 --> 00:05:29.310
 twitter and do not leave it aside because if 

00:05:27.930 --> 00:05:32.039
 you make twitter from the beginning you go to 

00:05:29.310 --> 00:05:33.330
 have less psuv without assets than from 

00:05:32.039 --> 00:05:34.889
 normal since they always watch the videos 

00:05:33.330 --> 00:05:36.990
 who climb since YouTube will fit 

00:05:34.889 --> 00:05:38.340
 very very bad another way to grow 

00:05:36.990 --> 00:05:40.289
 it's with daily video I 've checked it 

00:05:38.340 --> 00:05:42.870
 and with daily video it grows brutally 

00:05:40.289 --> 00:05:44.490
 faster than lived every two or three 

00:05:42.870 --> 00:05:46.680
 days and time when you upload a video 

00:05:44.490 --> 00:05:48.120
 daily if you keep the schedule people 

00:05:46.680 --> 00:05:50.039
 he knows that even if he does not get the 

00:05:48.120 --> 00:05:51.780
 afip the video will be there if you upload it 

00:05:50.039 --> 00:05:53.969
 at 5 o'clock here I 'll read it if 

00:05:51.780 --> 00:05:55.229
 you go up at 5 people know that at 5 

00:05:53.969 --> 00:05:57.300
 is going to watch video on your channel even though it is not 

00:05:55.229 --> 00:05:59.789
 publish and also twitter them 

00:05:57.300 --> 00:06:01.409
 It serves for that the truth that I would have 

00:05:59.789 --> 00:06:03.240
 liked to talk about this topic a little 

00:06:01.409 --> 00:06:05.940
 further but that as explained 

00:06:03.240 --> 00:06:07.740
 two very simple ways you know 

00:06:05.940 --> 00:06:09.210
 that you have to do spam do not do it 

00:06:07.740 --> 00:06:10.740
 very massive but you do from time to time 

00:06:09.210 --> 00:06:13.650
 if you have to upload daily video 

00:06:10.740 --> 00:06:15.180
 trying balls if you have to spend 

00:06:13.650 --> 00:06:16.889
 videos to the big ones although although they 

00:06:15.180 --> 00:06:18.240
 bother to go through twitter that does not 

00:06:16.889 --> 00:06:22.410
 I think it bothers them to see a fucking 

00:06:18.240 --> 00:06:24.720
 if there is no better good then that was all 

00:06:22.410 --> 00:06:29.630
 tell you what would be purple a greeting 

00:06:24.720 --> 00:06:29.630
 see you later the next goodbye
