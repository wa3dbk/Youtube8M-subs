00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.680
 pay minecraft brothers mod i am 

00:00:02.909 --> 00:00:06.270
 piece and today I'm here to introduce you 

00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:09.570
 anec romance in mod 

00:00:06.270 --> 00:00:10.950
 let's start immediately but let's go straight to 

00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:11.250
 see what this new introduces us 

00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:13.110
 fashion 

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:15.450
 this new way introduces new ones 

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:17.400
 items and a new way to play then 

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:19.949
 meanwhile it is first and I fear that it reintroduces is 

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:22.260
 the good needle for kraft are born needle 

00:00:19.949 --> 00:00:25.529
 just have a good thousand add it 

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:28.260
 in the crafty and will give us a good nest but 

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:30.449
 what we need this bonino and this one 

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:33.960
 good needle we will need to take the 

00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:34.710
 blood is literally the blood the 

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:36.180
 mob 

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:37.950
 meanwhile to use this mode 

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:39.300
 we need the glass bottle for 

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:43.379
 force if not we will not be able to collect 

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:45.059
 no blood we take the bon 

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:48.320
 idol in hand and click with the button 

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:51.120
 right on the school mob up with the button 

00:00:48.320 --> 00:00:54.719
 left on mob and you will see that he will have to 

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:57.180
 a jar of blood with the jar of love that 

00:00:54.719 --> 00:00:58.559
 we can make many kraft now there 

00:00:57.180 --> 00:01:00.690
 I'll show you let's take a 

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:04.589
 little bit of bottles and so we have 

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:06.240
 got some blood from the fashions 

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:08.430
 second item that introduces us to this 

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:10.350
 fashion is the book of necromancy that 

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:12.570
 they had neither color with the 

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:15.840
 necronomicon strauss signed with four 

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:18.869
 leather pieces a lot a a feather a 

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:22.020
 book a bottle a bottle 

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:24.119
 of blood and a nether star with the negro 

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:26.360
 Minion, we can do everything 

00:01:24.119 --> 00:01:29.310
 the negio minio will say ours 

00:01:26.360 --> 00:01:32.579
 object that we will need for kraft areas 

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:34.369
 whatever of this fad we say 

00:01:32.579 --> 00:01:37.049
 for the beautiful part of this fashion 

00:01:34.369 --> 00:01:41.430
 moreover, however, to use this mode 

00:01:37.049 --> 00:01:44.130
 we will need the times center flight here 

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:46.079
 blog trips here you don't see it because where 

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:49.079
 will highlight here you see the 

00:01:46.079 --> 00:01:51.869
 blogs there Chinese canvas kraft blog with a 

00:01:49.079 --> 00:01:54.200
 one piece of obsidian was a bit rustic 

00:01:51.869 --> 00:01:58.579
 and there is no blood garden 

00:01:54.200 --> 00:02:00.590
 little bottles of blood with this one 

00:01:58.579 --> 00:02:03.740
 will decide we will succeed in taking the souls 

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:05.479
 mobs with no-mob souls and us 

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:07.969
 we could say to make full use 

00:02:05.479 --> 00:02:11.090
 but this mob will have this fashion though 

00:02:07.969 --> 00:02:14.150
 we will always need great sports 

00:02:11.090 --> 00:02:16.700
 hall to use it when we kill 

00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:19.099
 a mob will appear this strange wake 

00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:20.780
 you see the skulls now I 

00:02:19.099 --> 00:02:23.180
 kill does not work on non-pick 

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:27.860
 they work I must have hit him badly 

00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:31.610
 that's why burke is even further down 

00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:33.829
 by salts ok let's take the pic why 

00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:37.390
 now I want to try a bug 

00:02:33.829 --> 00:02:42.019
 let me see if it's an ok bug 

00:02:37.390 --> 00:02:43.819
 let's get it ok perfect pig 

00:02:42.019 --> 00:02:45.560
 ok yes probably with the pig not 

00:02:43.819 --> 00:02:47.239
 it works at least it takes two shots 

00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:50.390
 but the end you see that there is too much 

00:02:47.239 --> 00:02:53.150
 this new new bottle 

00:02:50.390 --> 00:02:55.069
 the jolie that means the soul in 

00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:56.750
 bottle and now guys I do 

00:02:55.069 --> 00:03:00.200
 see which one this new is based on 

00:02:56.750 --> 00:03:03.019
 fashion then the dispute on which it is based 

00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:05.329
 and the altar of the altar is made in this way 

00:03:03.019 --> 00:03:06.170
 putting a piece of wood and two of 

00:03:05.329 --> 00:03:07.940
 kobret 

00:03:06.170 --> 00:03:09.650
 now it won't work because you have to 

00:03:07.940 --> 00:03:10.819
 to be a precise height I don't know 

00:03:09.650 --> 00:03:12.950
 what height 

00:03:10.819 --> 00:03:14.630
 then I'll show you how to do it yourself 

00:03:12.950 --> 00:03:18.340
 put this piece of wood two pieces 

00:03:14.630 --> 00:03:21.350
 of kobret right click on the 

00:03:18.340 --> 00:03:24.079
 on a piece of kobe ​​and or piece of 

00:03:21.350 --> 00:03:26.239
 wood and the altar should appear 

00:03:24.079 --> 00:03:29.150
 logically this fashion is still underway 

00:03:26.239 --> 00:03:30.920
 alpha and therefore also those small stages 

00:03:29.150 --> 00:03:33.319
 but don't worry about that soon 

00:03:30.920 --> 00:03:36.200
 they will achieve very little much 

00:03:33.319 --> 00:03:37.760
 well then crafter at this altar if 

00:03:36.200 --> 00:03:39.260
 we click with the right button we will see 

00:03:37.760 --> 00:03:40.190
 that we will see this new why 

00:03:39.260 --> 00:03:43.790
 army 

00:03:40.190 --> 00:03:45.540
 let's put the blood on one side e 

00:03:43.790 --> 00:03:48.689
 on the other side the soul 

00:03:45.540 --> 00:03:50.609
 then the thing I think is exceptional 

00:03:48.689 --> 00:03:52.680
 what is more beautiful than this new fashion is 

00:03:50.609 --> 00:03:53.280
 that we can create francs 

00:03:52.680 --> 00:03:55.469
 stan 

00:03:53.280 --> 00:03:58.049
 I don't know from monsters how we want them 

00:03:55.469 --> 00:04:00.689
 us how we do the routes in 

00:03:58.049 --> 00:04:03.000
 flash will symbolize the part 

00:04:00.689 --> 00:04:04.739
 zombie body the gam power 

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:07.590
 that of the creeper I hold it to the of 

00:04:04.739 --> 00:04:09.209
 spider and bonne that of the 

00:04:07.590 --> 00:04:10.769
 skeleton if we put it for example 

00:04:09.209 --> 00:04:13.019
 I do not know 

00:04:10.769 --> 00:04:15.150
 the hand we make of the zombie the body 

00:04:13.019 --> 00:04:16.620
 we do it decree for the legs 

00:04:15.150 --> 00:04:18.150
 let us look in fact that he is 

00:04:16.620 --> 00:04:21.810
 appearing slowly look at what's going on 

00:04:18.150 --> 00:04:23.729
 happening I don't know what to discover 

00:04:21.810 --> 00:04:28.190
 really weird stuff ok now it doesn't 

00:04:23.729 --> 00:04:33.150
 plus click ok perfect i'm wrong ok 

00:04:28.190 --> 00:04:33.840
 let's put the as a slave album like 

00:04:33.150 --> 00:04:37.470
 shall we 

00:04:33.840 --> 00:04:39.240
 the head of the skeleton and the other hand 

00:04:37.470 --> 00:04:40.680
 of the zombie has come to this point 

00:04:39.240 --> 00:04:43.009
 guys the only thing that's left for us 

00:04:40.680 --> 00:04:45.240
 to do is to raise our monster 

00:04:43.009 --> 00:04:48.389
 by clicking it shift then with the right button 

00:04:45.240 --> 00:04:51.150
 lose that this will stand up 

00:04:48.389 --> 00:04:53.099
 sort of strange on the short lo c o 

00:04:51.150 --> 00:04:55.229
 my god and how you will see that in chat 

00:04:53.099 --> 00:04:58.830
 Mine and dark minion will appear 

00:04:55.229 --> 00:05:01.860
 command to say so command for 

00:04:58.830 --> 00:05:02.610
 order sorry the way you want 

00:05:01.860 --> 00:05:04.169
 must do 

00:05:02.610 --> 00:05:06.300
 we right-click on his 

00:05:04.169 --> 00:05:08.370
 body see the million is sitting e 

00:05:06.300 --> 00:05:10.530
 minion is walking and will follow us will be 

00:05:08.370 --> 00:05:12.360
 let's say our personal slave 

00:05:10.530 --> 00:05:14.070
 now I still don't know if they have 

00:05:12.360 --> 00:05:15.630
 added the functionality of this mode 

00:05:14.070 --> 00:05:18.270
 for example action and maybe we can 

00:05:15.630 --> 00:05:20.490
 try to hit the mukki we watch 

00:05:18.270 --> 00:05:22.050
 what does nothing attack yet 

00:05:20.490 --> 00:05:24.060
 it defends only the new styles well 

00:05:22.050 --> 00:05:26.669
 anyway it's really fun now 

00:05:24.060 --> 00:05:28.320
 we try to kill him we try to 

00:05:26.669 --> 00:05:29.940
 let's see what drops us to nothing 

00:05:28.320 --> 00:05:32.909
 it has nothing to do with it because it will be the union 

00:05:29.940 --> 00:05:35.849
 of many new or whatever you can 

00:05:32.909 --> 00:05:38.139
 indulge in creating very strange mobs 

00:05:35.849 --> 00:05:41.879
 let's try creating a mod 

00:05:38.139 --> 00:05:49.229
 different bob cool then we create head 

00:05:41.879 --> 00:05:52.150
 without a headless head I feel bad 

00:05:49.229 --> 00:05:52.900
 nou where to force to put it ok nothing has 

00:05:52.150 --> 00:05:55.659
 destroyed everything 

00:05:52.900 --> 00:05:57.099
 no guys anyway this is what 

00:05:55.659 --> 00:05:59.139
 add this new fashion and the 

00:05:57.099 --> 00:06:00.550
 possibility of creating monsters made up 

00:05:59.139 --> 00:06:03.460
 measure that could also be useful to 

00:06:00.550 --> 00:06:06.400
 serve us for I do not know of the courts in 

00:06:03.460 --> 00:06:07.629
 minecraft so guys that's it 

00:06:06.400 --> 00:06:08.529
 what introduces us this new one 

00:06:07.629 --> 00:06:10.029
 fashion 

00:06:08.529 --> 00:06:11.919
 remember to subscribe to the channel 

00:06:10.029 --> 00:06:14.020
 put a nice I like and I'll see you in 

00:06:11.919 --> 00:06:16.060
 an upcoming video on minecraft mod 

00:06:14.020 --> 00:06:18.789
 here's one last thing guys 

00:06:16.060 --> 00:06:19.930
 preparing the gift for the thousand 

00:06:18.789 --> 00:06:23.199
 subscribers 

00:06:19.930 --> 00:06:26.919
 we will need to know if you are interested 

00:06:23.199 --> 00:06:28.150
 a package more let's say based on 

00:06:26.919 --> 00:06:30.719
 adventure 

00:06:28.150 --> 00:06:33.219
 or based on I don't know the 

00:06:30.719 --> 00:06:35.680
 building maybe a package like la 

00:06:33.219 --> 00:06:39.039
 technique but with a lot of fashions but 

00:06:35.680 --> 00:06:39.909
 much more long-lived ie you can 

00:06:39.039 --> 00:06:42.520
 have more fun 

00:06:39.909 --> 00:06:44.529
 logically if the requests will be 

00:06:42.520 --> 00:06:49.020
 so many for all these two types of fashions 

00:06:44.529 --> 00:06:52.569
 we will prepare both a type of mode 

00:06:49.020 --> 00:06:54.610
 made to adventure is a kind of fashion 

00:06:52.569 --> 00:06:56.319
 made construction 

00:06:54.610 --> 00:06:59.050
 let us know however which you prefer 

00:06:56.319 --> 00:07:00.879
 we will focus first on which 

00:06:59.050 --> 00:07:03.870
 fashions and in any case don't worry not 

00:07:00.879 --> 00:07:06.490
 will be copied packages but will be 

00:07:03.870 --> 00:07:08.800
 we say a great package we are 

00:07:06.490 --> 00:07:11.199
 also updating the 1.4.5 completely 

00:07:08.800 --> 00:07:12.789
 and it is getting really a lot 

00:07:11.199 --> 00:07:14.979
 fun this project and above all 

00:07:12.789 --> 00:07:16.240
 very, very nice, see you 

00:07:14.979 --> 00:07:18.479
 then to a next video and hello to 

00:07:16.240 --> 00:07:18.479
 all boys
