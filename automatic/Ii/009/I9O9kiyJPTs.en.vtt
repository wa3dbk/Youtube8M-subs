00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:36.290 
that we were at the beginning of the

00:01:36.290 --> 00:01:39.220 
that we were at the beginning of the
season<00:01:36.710> right<00:01:37.250> the<00:01:37.370> way<00:01:37.460> through<00:01:37.490> this<00:01:38.230> you're

00:01:40.780 --> 00:01:40.790 
not going to get much time that's the

00:01:40.790 --> 00:01:42.610 
not going to get much time that's the
reality<00:01:41.000> of<00:01:41.270> it<00:01:41.600> you<00:01:42.140> know<00:01:42.260> the<00:01:42.410> modern

00:03:42.699 --> 00:03:42.709 
valuation of what you consider to be one

00:03:42.709 --> 00:03:44.890

00:03:44.890 --> 00:03:44.900 
of the best records in the world so um

00:03:44.900 --> 00:03:48.240
