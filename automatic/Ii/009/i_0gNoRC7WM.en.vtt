today<00:00:08.200> I<00:00:08.230> have<00:00:08.530> a<00:00:08.559> product<00:00:09.099> to<00:00:09.639> unbox<00:00:10.090> that<00:00:10.660> is

00:00:10.799 --> 00:00:10.809 
today I have a product to unbox that is

00:00:10.809 --> 00:00:16.679 
today I have a product to unbox that is
so<00:00:11.110> cool<00:00:11.469> that<00:00:11.980> it<00:00:12.150> comes<00:00:13.150> in<00:00:13.570> three<00:00:14.350> boxes<00:00:15.689> at

00:00:16.679 --> 00:00:16.689 
so cool that it comes in three boxes at

00:00:16.689 --> 00:00:20.609 
so cool that it comes in three boxes at
the<00:00:16.930> same<00:00:17.170> time<00:00:17.470> ah<00:00:18.270> so<00:00:19.270> this<00:00:19.509> is<00:00:19.960> actually<00:00:20.590> I

00:00:20.609 --> 00:00:20.619 
the same time ah so this is actually I

00:00:20.619 --> 00:00:21.990 
the same time ah so this is actually I
guess<00:00:20.860> you<00:00:21.009> could<00:00:21.189> probably<00:00:21.310> do<00:00:21.700> it<00:00:21.730> in<00:00:21.880> only

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:22.000 
guess you could probably do it in only

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:24.889 
guess you could probably do it in only
two<00:00:22.270> boxes<00:00:22.630> but<00:00:22.840> this<00:00:23.050> is<00:00:23.320> the<00:00:24.040> muskan

00:00:24.889 --> 00:00:24.899 
two boxes but this is the muskan

00:00:24.899 --> 00:00:28.769 
two boxes but this is the muskan
Copperhead<00:00:25.919> memory<00:00:26.919> kit<00:00:27.489> and<00:00:28.239> so<00:00:28.450> I'm<00:00:28.540> going

00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:28.779 
Copperhead memory kit and so I'm going

00:00:28.779 --> 00:00:31.409 
Copperhead memory kit and so I'm going
to<00:00:28.840> show<00:00:29.079> you<00:00:29.140> all<00:00:29.619> the<00:00:29.919> things<00:00:29.950> that<00:00:30.579> it<00:00:31.059> comes

00:00:31.409 --> 00:00:31.419 
to show you all the things that it comes

00:00:31.419 --> 00:00:34.350 
to show you all the things that it comes
with<00:00:31.540> keep<00:00:32.500> your<00:00:32.680> eyes<00:00:32.800> on<00:00:32.829> the<00:00:33.160> boxes<00:00:33.610> which

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:34.360 
with keep your eyes on the boxes which

00:00:34.360 --> 00:00:36.780 
with keep your eyes on the boxes which
one<00:00:34.600> has<00:00:34.840> what<00:00:35.110> inside<00:00:35.500> given<00:00:36.370> that<00:00:36.489> you<00:00:36.579> don't

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:36.790 
one has what inside given that you don't

00:00:36.790 --> 00:00:39.630 
one has what inside given that you don't
know<00:00:36.910> what's<00:00:37.120> inside<00:00:37.390> any<00:00:37.600> of<00:00:37.780> them<00:00:37.899> yet<00:00:38.640> it's

00:00:39.630 --> 00:00:39.640 
know what's inside any of them yet it's

00:00:39.640 --> 00:00:41.689 
know what's inside any of them yet it's
going<00:00:39.820> to<00:00:39.910> be<00:00:39.969> very<00:00:40.149> difficult<00:00:40.329> to<00:00:40.539> pick<00:00:40.719> out

00:00:41.689 --> 00:00:41.699 
going to be very difficult to pick out

00:00:41.699 --> 00:00:45.329 
going to be very difficult to pick out
which<00:00:42.699> one<00:00:42.940> has<00:00:43.210> the<00:00:43.780> sexy<00:00:44.530> memory<00:00:44.859> modules

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:45.339 
which one has the sexy memory modules

00:00:45.339 --> 00:00:48.090 
which one has the sexy memory modules
and<00:00:45.670> which<00:00:45.910> one<00:00:46.120> has<00:00:46.390> the<00:00:47.050> waterblock

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:48.100 
and which one has the waterblock

00:00:48.100 --> 00:00:49.979 
and which one has the waterblock
that<00:00:48.460> goes<00:00:48.670> with<00:00:49.059> them<00:00:49.300> so<00:00:49.480> the<00:00:49.600> first<00:00:49.809> thing

00:00:49.979 --> 00:00:49.989 
that goes with them so the first thing

00:00:49.989 --> 00:00:51.689 
that goes with them so the first thing
I'm<00:00:50.079> going<00:00:50.170> to<00:00:50.230> show<00:00:50.320> you<00:00:50.440> guys<00:00:50.679> is<00:00:51.010> what<00:00:51.670> I

00:00:51.689 --> 00:00:51.699 
I'm going to show you guys is what I

00:00:51.699 --> 00:00:53.700 
I'm going to show you guys is what I
have<00:00:51.969> here<00:00:52.269> these<00:00:52.420> are<00:00:52.809> I<00:00:53.140> actually

00:00:53.700 --> 00:00:53.710 
have here these are I actually

00:00:53.710 --> 00:00:57.349 
have here these are I actually
specifically<00:00:54.219> asked<00:00:54.760> for<00:00:54.820> very<00:00:55.179> basic<00:00:55.449> memory

00:00:57.349 --> 00:00:57.359 
specifically asked for very basic memory

00:00:57.359 --> 00:01:00.119 
specifically asked for very basic memory
but<00:00:58.359> most<00:00:58.659> of<00:00:58.870> the<00:00:59.019> Copperhead<00:00:59.559> SKUs<00:00:59.949> are

00:01:00.119 --> 00:01:00.129 
but most of the Copperhead SKUs are

00:01:00.129 --> 00:01:01.860 
but most of the Copperhead SKUs are
going<00:01:00.309> to<00:01:00.429> be<00:01:00.550> very<00:01:00.819> very<00:01:01.030> high-end<00:01:01.539> memory

00:01:01.860 --> 00:01:01.870 
going to be very very high-end memory

00:01:01.870 --> 00:01:05.700 
going to be very very high-end memory
and<00:01:02.800> let<00:01:03.039> you<00:01:03.129> know<00:01:03.249> PC<00:01:03.609> through<00:01:03.789> ddr3<00:01:04.780> 2133

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:05.710 
and let you know PC through ddr3 2133

00:01:05.710 --> 00:01:08.460 
and let you know PC through ddr3 2133
for<00:01:05.890> example<00:01:06.250> these<00:01:06.340> are<00:01:06.520> only<00:01:06.640> ddr3<00:01:07.470> 1600

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:08.470 
for example these are only ddr3 1600

00:01:08.470 --> 00:01:11.970 
for example these are only ddr3 1600
kits<00:01:09.220> okay<00:01:09.940> so<00:01:10.000> these<00:01:10.210> are<00:01:10.270> 2<00:01:10.840> by<00:01:11.080> 4<00:01:11.440> gig<00:01:11.710> kits

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:11.980 
kits okay so these are 2 by 4 gig kits

00:01:11.980 --> 00:01:14.340 
kits okay so these are 2 by 4 gig kits
two<00:01:12.490> of<00:01:12.640> them<00:01:12.850> for<00:01:13.120> a<00:01:13.150> total<00:01:13.480> of<00:01:13.540> 16<00:01:13.960> gigs<00:01:14.200> of

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:14.350 
two of them for a total of 16 gigs of

00:01:14.350 --> 00:01:16.110 
two of them for a total of 16 gigs of
ram<00:01:14.560> and<00:01:14.770> this<00:01:15.220> is<00:01:15.340> going<00:01:15.520> to<00:01:15.700> be<00:01:15.790> for<00:01:16.030> my

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:16.120 
ram and this is going to be for my

00:01:16.120 --> 00:01:21.240 
ram and this is going to be for my
ultimate<00:01:17.100> extreme<00:01:18.930> build<00:01:19.930> guide<00:01:20.170> ok<00:01:20.920> so<00:01:20.980> I'm

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:21.250 
ultimate extreme build guide ok so I'm

00:01:21.250 --> 00:01:22.910 
ultimate extreme build guide ok so I'm
going<00:01:21.370> to<00:01:21.430> have<00:01:21.610> 16<00:01:22.150> gigs<00:01:22.450> of

00:01:22.910 --> 00:01:22.920 
going to have 16 gigs of

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:26.250 
going to have 16 gigs of
muskan<00:01:23.920> ddr3<00:01:24.520> now<00:01:24.670> the<00:01:25.390> reason<00:01:25.780> that<00:01:25.900> I<00:01:25.960> ended

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:26.260 
muskan ddr3 now the reason that I ended

00:01:26.260 --> 00:01:29.340 
muskan ddr3 now the reason that I ended
up<00:01:26.350> going<00:01:26.560> with<00:01:26.710> the<00:01:26.890> ddr3<00:01:27.670> 1600<00:01:28.150> versus<00:01:28.930> like

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:29.350 
up going with the ddr3 1600 versus like

00:01:29.350 --> 00:01:32.340 
up going with the ddr3 1600 versus like
a<00:01:29.380> 21<00:01:29.800> 33<00:01:30.160> or<00:01:30.490> an<00:01:30.580> 1866<00:01:31.390> higher<00:01:31.660> spec<00:01:31.960> like<00:01:32.140> that

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:32.350 
a 21 33 or an 1866 higher spec like that

00:01:32.350 --> 00:01:35.250 
a 21 33 or an 1866 higher spec like that
is<00:01:32.590> that<00:01:33.130> I<00:01:33.400> opted<00:01:33.940> for<00:01:33.970> this<00:01:34.480> machine<00:01:34.690> to<00:01:35.110> go

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:35.260 
is that I opted for this machine to go

00:01:35.260 --> 00:01:37.770 
is that I opted for this machine to go
with<00:01:35.440> higher<00:01:35.950> capacity<00:01:36.820> of<00:01:36.940> ram<00:01:37.150> so<00:01:37.180> if<00:01:37.510> I<00:01:37.600> had

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:37.780 
with higher capacity of ram so if I had

00:01:37.780 --> 00:01:40.500 
with higher capacity of ram so if I had
decided<00:01:37.870> to<00:01:38.200> go<00:01:38.380> for<00:01:38.620> a<00:01:38.650> 2<00:01:38.920> by<00:01:39.130> 4<00:01:39.160> so<00:01:40.000> just<00:01:40.270> 8

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:40.510 
decided to go for a 2 by 4 so just 8

00:01:40.510 --> 00:01:42.720 
decided to go for a 2 by 4 so just 8
gigs<00:01:40.750> of<00:01:40.870> total<00:01:41.200> ram<00:01:41.380> then<00:01:41.920> being<00:01:42.310> able<00:01:42.430> to<00:01:42.580> get

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:42.730 
gigs of total ram then being able to get

00:01:42.730 --> 00:01:44.550 
gigs of total ram then being able to get
it<00:01:42.910> to<00:01:43.120> run<00:01:43.240> at<00:01:43.390> high<00:01:43.570> frequencies<00:01:44.230> is<00:01:44.380> much

00:01:44.550 --> 00:01:44.560 
it to run at high frequencies is much

00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:46.470 
it to run at high frequencies is much
easier<00:01:45.100> whereas<00:01:45.730> if<00:01:45.850> I<00:01:45.940> go<00:01:45.970> for<00:01:46.330> lower

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:46.480 
easier whereas if I go for lower

00:01:46.480 --> 00:01:48.570 
easier whereas if I go for lower
frequencies<00:01:47.140> then<00:01:47.380> I<00:01:47.470> can<00:01:47.710> bulk<00:01:47.950> up<00:01:48.160> and<00:01:48.280> I<00:01:48.400> can

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:48.580 
frequencies then I can bulk up and I can

00:01:48.580 --> 00:01:50.580 
frequencies then I can bulk up and I can
throw<00:01:48.790> in<00:01:49.030> four<00:01:49.300> sticks<00:01:49.570> of<00:01:49.720> memory<00:01:50.020> without

00:01:50.580 --> 00:01:50.590 
throw in four sticks of memory without

00:01:50.590 --> 00:01:52.500 
throw in four sticks of memory without
worrying<00:01:51.100> about<00:01:51.280> any<00:01:51.580> stability<00:01:51.820> problems

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:52.510 
worrying about any stability problems

00:01:52.510 --> 00:01:55.200 
worrying about any stability problems
now<00:01:52.720> here<00:01:53.410> is<00:01:53.680> where<00:01:54.010> the<00:01:54.220> magic<00:01:54.460> happens

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:55.210 
now here is where the magic happens

00:01:55.210 --> 00:01:59.430 
now here is where the magic happens
this<00:01:57.450> I'm<00:01:58.450> going<00:01:58.570> to<00:01:58.660> be<00:01:58.750> careful<00:01:58.960> not<00:01:59.260> to

00:01:59.430 --> 00:01:59.440 
this I'm going to be careful not to

00:01:59.440 --> 00:02:01.170 
this I'm going to be careful not to
touch<00:01:59.590> the<00:01:59.620> top<00:02:00.010> as<00:02:00.220> much<00:02:00.250> as<00:02:00.520> possible<00:02:00.760> is<00:02:01.120> the

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:01.180 
touch the top as much as possible is the

00:02:01.180 --> 00:02:04.920 
touch the top as much as possible is the
Musk<00:02:02.020> an<00:02:02.230> enhanced<00:02:02.950> Copperhead<00:02:03.940> waterblock

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:04.930 
Musk an enhanced Copperhead waterblock

00:02:04.930 --> 00:02:07.680 
Musk an enhanced Copperhead waterblock
so<00:02:05.650> what<00:02:05.860> you<00:02:05.980> do<00:02:06.160> is<00:02:06.370> you<00:02:06.670> take<00:02:06.910> these<00:02:07.300> two

in any number of copperhead modules

00:02:41.170 --> 00:02:44.280 
in any number of copperhead modules
whether<00:02:41.439> it<00:02:41.709> is<00:02:41.829> three<00:02:42.370> or<00:02:42.609> four<00:02:43.120> I<00:02:43.359> think<00:02:43.870> four

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:44.290 
whether it is three or four I think four

00:02:44.290 --> 00:02:47.280 
whether it is three or four I think four
is<00:02:44.409> the<00:02:44.620> max<00:02:44.829> and<00:02:45.159> you<00:02:45.419> screw<00:02:46.419> that<00:02:46.540> in<00:02:46.719> you<00:02:47.079> put

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:47.290 
is the max and you screw that in you put

00:02:47.290 --> 00:02:48.899 
is the max and you screw that in you put
some<00:02:47.469> thermal<00:02:47.799> interface<00:02:48.040> material<00:02:48.219> in

00:02:48.899 --> 00:02:48.909 
some thermal interface material in

00:02:48.909 --> 00:02:51.509 
some thermal interface material in
between<00:02:49.450> the<00:02:50.109> top<00:02:50.590> of<00:02:50.739> the<00:02:50.799> Copperhead<00:02:51.189> module

00:02:51.509 --> 00:02:51.519 
between the top of the Copperhead module

00:02:51.519 --> 00:02:54.050 
between the top of the Copperhead module
here<00:02:51.730> which<00:02:51.879> you<00:02:52.000> can<00:02:52.150> see<00:02:52.180> is<00:02:52.480> flat<00:02:53.290> and<00:02:53.590> the

00:02:54.050 --> 00:02:54.060 
here which you can see is flat and the

00:02:54.060 --> 00:02:57.420 
here which you can see is flat and the
bottom<00:02:55.060> of<00:02:55.239> the<00:02:55.599> water<00:02:56.260> block<00:02:56.560> itself<00:02:57.069> and

00:02:57.420 --> 00:02:57.430 
bottom of the water block itself and

00:02:57.430 --> 00:03:00.479 
bottom of the water block itself and
that<00:02:58.209> is<00:02:58.449> how<00:02:58.689> you<00:02:58.750> cool<00:02:59.230> your<00:02:59.469> memory<00:02:59.859> using

00:03:00.479 --> 00:03:00.489 
that is how you cool your memory using

00:03:00.489 --> 00:03:03.990 
that is how you cool your memory using
water<00:03:00.790> cooling<00:03:01.269> so<00:03:02.370> what<00:03:03.370> this<00:03:03.489> allows<00:03:03.639> you<00:03:03.969> to

00:03:03.990 --> 00:03:04.000 
water cooling so what this allows you to

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:06.720 
water cooling so what this allows you to
do<00:03:04.209> is<00:03:04.419> it<00:03:04.989> allows<00:03:05.199> you<00:03:05.409> to<00:03:05.439> install<00:03:06.219> these

00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:06.730 
do is it allows you to install these

00:03:06.730 --> 00:03:09.119 
do is it allows you to install these
modules<00:03:07.419> and<00:03:07.689> then<00:03:07.900> the<00:03:08.049> block<00:03:08.290> on<00:03:08.530> top<00:03:08.829> of<00:03:08.980> it

00:03:09.119 --> 00:03:09.129 
modules and then the block on top of it

00:03:09.129 --> 00:03:11.580 
modules and then the block on top of it
no<00:03:09.609> matter<00:03:09.790> what<00:03:10.150> the<00:03:10.540> spacing<00:03:10.989> of<00:03:11.109> your<00:03:11.379> RAM
