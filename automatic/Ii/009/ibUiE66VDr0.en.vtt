00:01:31.430 --> 00:01:38.140
 let's open the scj hydro point n 

00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:40.000

00:01:48.890 --> 00:01:53.700
 very well 

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:56.189
 now we copy everything 

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:57.400
 and we go to where we have installed the 

00:01:56.189 --> 00:02:00.090
 Show 

00:01:57.400 --> 00:02:05.380
 here we see it with the square enix folder 

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:08.729
 tom raider is worth and we copy Ã¡vila 

00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:08.729
 I say how we stick 

00:02:09.259 --> 00:02:16.880
 we replace everything 

00:02:11.530 --> 00:02:19.069
 it is already now we can enter the 

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:22.510
 to direct access 

00:02:19.069 --> 00:02:22.510
 how will you see eyes in spanish 

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:26.819
 you put the image quality that was that 

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:28.739
 milestone of history and nothing now a little bit 

00:02:26.819 --> 00:02:31.980
 later in the video I will leave you in the 

00:02:28.739 --> 00:02:33.690
 installation of the fut a locker and nothing and 

00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:36.360
 then a little more before that video 

00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:38.040
 leave us look I'm friends 

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:41.280
 good news that tom has left 

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:43.019
 raider for pc but it is not a version 

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:45.629
 official of the scene or that is a 

00:02:43.019 --> 00:02:48.629
 full version a what that means 

00:02:45.629 --> 00:02:50.970
 which comes separately and will crack 

00:02:48.629 --> 00:02:54.840
 I notice the game works perfectly 

00:02:50.970 --> 00:02:56.849
 it's a multi 14 14 languages but I do 

00:02:54.840 --> 00:02:59.489
 I would advise you to expect a couple of 

00:02:56.849 --> 00:03:02.549
 days for you to go an official version 

00:02:59.489 --> 00:03:04.890
 of al cen since the cracks of these 

00:03:02.549 --> 00:03:08.849
 games always give some late or 

00:03:04.890 --> 00:03:12.180
 early in some mission some topic 

00:03:08.849 --> 00:03:14.370
 graphic I do not know but I would expect a 

00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:16.920
 official version of the cen but good 

00:03:14.370 --> 00:03:19.379
 I'm going to teach how to install the game 

00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:21.870
 and also a little gameplay come 

00:03:19.379 --> 00:03:25.049
 a low of the page game we 

00:03:21.870 --> 00:03:27.370
 will come out this folder that is the game like 

00:03:25.049 --> 00:03:29.610
 you will see is the game 

00:03:27.370 --> 00:03:31.350
 in this folder is the crack 

00:03:29.610 --> 00:03:32.700
 well, we have to do what 

00:03:31.350 --> 00:03:34.800
 following 

00:03:32.700 --> 00:03:38.010
 we open the crack we copy the three 

00:03:34.800 --> 00:03:41.190
 files we copy we go to the folder of 

00:03:38.010 --> 00:03:43.500
 game and we paste 

00:03:41.190 --> 00:03:45.740
 I've done it before but well what 

00:03:43.500 --> 00:03:48.480
 I do again as to replace everything 

00:03:45.740 --> 00:03:52.350
 you will see here that they are already copied 

00:03:48.480 --> 00:03:54.300
 the next step we have to go to this 

00:03:52.350 --> 00:03:59.300
 file puts steam going to work three of 

00:03:54.300 --> 00:04:02.120
 m.de and we open it as a notebook 

00:03:59.300 --> 00:04:03.920
 you will see what he puts this is so that he 

00:04:02.120 --> 00:04:06.850
 start the game supposedly 

00:04:03.920 --> 00:04:09.590
 supposedly not serial in English 

00:04:06.850 --> 00:04:11.410
 you can swim we can in Spanish or in the 

00:04:09.590 --> 00:04:14.230
 language we want 

00:04:11.410 --> 00:04:17.310
 let's put spanish 

00:04:14.230 --> 00:04:20.000
 and we keep 

00:04:17.310 --> 00:04:21.709
 already the game itself 

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:23.210
 what is the game's entry in the 

00:04:21.709 --> 00:04:27.520
 home will be in Spanish 

00:04:23.210 --> 00:04:27.520
 Well, we give tom raider here 

00:04:27.639 --> 00:04:32.050
 and as you will see it is in Spanish before 

00:04:30.280 --> 00:04:34.509
 make up English then be in English in 

00:04:32.050 --> 00:04:37.810
 Italian or being in italy well let's 

00:04:34.509 --> 00:04:39.999
 see let's play as we'll see 

00:04:37.810 --> 00:04:41.710
 we are inside the game as you will see 

00:04:39.999 --> 00:04:43.599
 here that says they are not available 

00:04:41.710 --> 00:04:47.020
 still the servers of tom raider 

00:04:43.599 --> 00:04:49.779
 it comes out in a couple of days or tomorrow or 

00:04:47.020 --> 00:04:51.639
 past it seems to me it does not look very good and 

00:04:49.779 --> 00:04:54.580
 nothing I being a little before but 

00:04:51.639 --> 00:04:56.340
 let's start a new game many, as you will see 

00:04:54.580 --> 00:04:59.340
 since we are in the game we are going to 

00:04:56.340 --> 00:04:59.340
 throw us 

00:05:09.630 --> 00:05:18.710
 as you will see the audio in English but the 

00:05:12.800 --> 00:05:18.710
 issues of writings and titles 

00:05:19.680 --> 00:05:24.090
 that's why I say better I hope now a 

00:05:21.900 --> 00:05:25.520
 official version of the one that will come in 

00:05:24.090 --> 00:05:28.860
 Spanish 

00:05:25.520 --> 00:05:31.720
 then we have to come here 

00:05:28.860 --> 00:05:34.020
 he said to eat the rope 

00:05:31.720 --> 00:05:34.020
 louis 

00:05:50.249 --> 00:05:56.090
 I will use repeatedly to throw 

00:05:53.400 --> 00:05:56.090
 good 

00:05:58.569 --> 00:06:03.179
 let's go the blood hour 

00:06:03.639 --> 00:06:06.479
 13 

00:06:09.880 --> 00:06:13.350
 these two falls 

00:06:14.720 --> 00:06:20.640
 forward the now man 

00:06:17.830 --> 00:06:20.640
 to the girl 

00:06:21.460 --> 00:06:24.690
 although we are arrows 

00:06:28.710 --> 00:06:31.710
 stones 

00:06:38.849 --> 00:06:43.409
 many here I leave it because to see if it goes to 

00:06:41.759 --> 00:06:44.999
 skip a copyright or any story 

00:06:43.409 --> 00:06:47.669
 and nothing like you will see or it works 

00:06:44.999 --> 00:06:49.559
 perfectly and nobody believes and low and 

00:06:47.669 --> 00:06:52.169
 You know where it comes from what you have if you 

00:06:49.559 --> 00:06:55.669
