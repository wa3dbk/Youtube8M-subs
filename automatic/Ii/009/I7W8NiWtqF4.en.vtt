um i make them easier by just making
them<00:02:20.080> octaves<00:02:21.040> instead<00:02:21.430> of<00:02:21.520> like<00:02:21.730> freaky

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:22.090 
them octaves instead of like freaky

00:02:22.090 --> 00:02:23.699 
them octaves instead of like freaky
stuff<00:02:22.360> because<00:02:22.930> it's<00:02:23.110> just<00:02:23.200> the<00:02:23.320> left<00:02:23.530> hand

00:02:23.699 --> 00:02:23.709 
stuff because it's just the left hand

00:02:23.709 --> 00:02:25.110 
stuff because it's just the left hand
which<00:02:23.860> is<00:02:23.890> like<00:02:24.130> to<00:02:24.310> backup<00:02:24.489> the<00:02:24.760> right<00:02:24.910> hand

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:25.120 
which is like to backup the right hand

00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:29.130 
which is like to backup the right hand
so<00:02:26.489> what<00:02:27.489> the<00:02:27.580> left<00:02:27.760> hand<00:02:27.880> is<00:02:28.120> going<00:02:28.239> to<00:02:28.660> be<00:02:28.840> is

00:02:29.130 --> 00:02:29.140 
so what the left hand is going to be is

00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:32.490 
so what the left hand is going to be is
a<00:02:29.440> c<00:02:29.950> or<00:02:30.310> octaves<00:02:30.959> that's<00:02:31.959> completely

00:02:32.490 --> 00:02:32.500 
a c or octaves that's completely

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:35.130 
a c or octaves that's completely
optional<00:02:33.150> f

00:02:35.130 --> 00:02:35.140 
optional f

00:02:35.140 --> 00:02:39.150 
optional f
and<00:02:36.070> then<00:02:36.190> a<00:02:36.400> and<00:02:37.000> then<00:02:37.840> G<00:02:38.260> as<00:02:38.560> each<00:02:38.860> of<00:02:39.040> those

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:39.160 
and then a and then G as each of those

00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:42.930 
and then a and then G as each of those
chords<00:02:40.030> go<00:02:40.420> with<00:02:41.140> each<00:02:41.620> thourough

00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:42.940 
chords go with each thourough

00:02:42.940 --> 00:02:45.330 
chords go with each thourough
