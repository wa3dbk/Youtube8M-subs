Hey Cookaholics, Chef Kendra here and today
we’re making Quick Chicken Cacciatore. Make

00:00:10.020 --> 00:00:13.400
sure to use some good quality crushed tomatoes.
It really makes a difference.

00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:15.900
I’m chopping our onions and green bell peppers.

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:20.960
I’m getting some skinless, boneless, chicken
thighs cut into 2 inch pieces into a pan with

00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:25.099
a little olive oil over medium low heat. Of
course you can use skinless, boneless, chicken

00:00:25.099 --> 00:00:26.099
breast if that’s your thing.

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:29.739
Now I’m going to stir them around from time
to time and I’m going to cook them until

00:00:29.739 --> 00:00:32.090
they’re just about done and have some nice
color on them.

00:00:32.090 --> 00:00:42.540
Now I’m adding those onions and the bell
that we chopped earlier. I’m going to stir

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:47.300
this around until the onions and green peppers
become translucent and soften up a bit just

00:00:47.300 --> 00:00:52.500
like so. We like that fond at the bottom of
the pan because it adds flavor to the dish.

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:57.680
The fond will be scraped up when we add the
tomatoes.

00:00:57.680 --> 00:01:06.060
Trivia Time. How many varieties of tomatoes
are there? A. 3000 B. 10,000 C. 7000. Leave

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:10.120
your answer in the comments below!

00:01:10.120 --> 00:01:21.120
Now I’m going to add the rest of the stuff.
I’m adding the garlic powder and salt. Italian

00:01:21.120 --> 00:01:27.110
seasoning goes in. A little bit of sugar to
tamper some of the acidity that the crushed

00:01:27.110 --> 00:01:31.860
tomatoes are going to bring to the party.
A little cayenne pepper, you can use black

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:33.229
pepper instead.

00:01:33.229 --> 00:01:44.170
I’m going to stir the seasonings in well.
Guys, this smells incredible.

00:01:44.170 --> 00:01:49.270
Now the canned crushed tomatoes go in. I’m
just going to give it a hardy stir. After

00:01:49.270 --> 00:01:54.260
its mixed well I’m going to reduce the heat
to low, let it come to a slight bubble and

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:59.830
put on the lid and simmer for 10 minutes.
This is the time to get your favorite pasta

00:01:59.830 --> 00:02:01.680
into some boiling water.

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:08.340
I’m going to plate some up and finish with
a sprinkling of fresh Parmesan cheese, and

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:09.640
that’s all it is to it.

00:02:09.640 --> 00:02:12.650
You can get the recipe at chefkendraseasycooking.com

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:52.129
That’s all for this week, I’m see you
next week Chef Kendra is out. Peace.

00:02:52.129 --> 00:02:55.699
If you guessed b. you know your tomatoes.
