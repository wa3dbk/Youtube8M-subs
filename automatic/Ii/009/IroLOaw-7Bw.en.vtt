00:00:01.139 --> 00:00:05.980
 ah 

00:00:03.729 --> 00:00:08.410
 hi girls was in this game 

00:00:05.980 --> 00:00:10.829
 different let's make a cool day or 

00:00:08.410 --> 00:00:13.240
 download it yourself through this case 

00:00:10.829 --> 00:00:16.030
 I'm going to transform it because I 

00:00:13.240 --> 00:00:19.359
 it seems that it is quite flat this is 

00:00:16.030 --> 00:00:21.429
 an iphone 3gs case but you 

00:00:19.359 --> 00:00:23.019
 can use any case that rocks 

00:00:21.429 --> 00:00:26.259
 not anyone who serves them 

00:00:23.019 --> 00:00:27.609
 if we are not going to reinvent what I 

00:00:26.259 --> 00:00:30.070
 first thing to do is cut a 

00:00:27.609 --> 00:00:32.590
 little bit of tape and I'm going to put it to 

00:00:30.070 --> 00:00:35.649
 the manzanita because it's like the 

00:00:32.590 --> 00:00:39.140
 grace of this case that makes see how 

00:00:35.649 --> 00:00:43.000
 that if the good iphone was had 

00:00:39.140 --> 00:00:47.660
 it was like an iphone brand 

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:49.690
 you can do this if your case has the 

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:52.949
 logo of the 

00:00:49.690 --> 00:00:52.949
 of your phone's brand 

00:00:54.990 --> 00:00:59.410
 and here it protects 

00:00:57.250 --> 00:01:01.960
 and basically, what are we going to 

00:00:59.410 --> 00:01:04.420
 use are paintings of bones 

00:01:01.960 --> 00:01:05.880
 I'm going to use this first one that is 

00:01:04.420 --> 00:01:08.719
 arrangement 

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:08.719
 First 

00:01:14.830 --> 00:01:17.640
 the points 

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:28.690
 That's how it went 

00:01:23.720 --> 00:01:28.690
 with practices a little bit bigger 

00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:39.600
 now I'm going to use up green from 

00:01:37.210 --> 00:01:39.600
 valme 

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:51.320
 I believe that in this way if it gives you 

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:51.320
 that a personal touch 

00:01:51.860 --> 00:01:56.780
 in particular this color bored me like this 

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:59.049
 all white 

00:01:56.780 --> 00:01:59.049
 ah 

00:01:59.940 --> 00:02:03.830
 you can give him a fit of madness 

00:02:04.330 --> 00:02:07.380
 but do not dry well 

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:12.140
 and go doing as a kind of hairline 

00:02:30.940 --> 00:02:36.840
 I'm going to take this blue and I'm going to do like 

00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:36.840
 kind of stripes 

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:44.470
 give it a touch of madness 

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:58.070
 I'm going to use this blue here and I'm going to continue 

00:02:54.510 --> 00:02:58.070
 doing as a kind of points 

00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:20.390
 this same one that is with the previous blue 

00:03:16.140 --> 00:03:20.390
 but horizontally 

00:03:25.220 --> 00:03:30.030
 placed a 

00:03:28.050 --> 00:03:33.480
 a fabric or something that I was not using 

00:03:30.030 --> 00:03:36.120
 below so you're not going to stain the 

00:03:33.480 --> 00:03:39.150
 surface where are you working fear 

00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:41.090
 edited this diagonal to place it 

00:03:39.150 --> 00:03:44.989
 water in it 

00:03:41.090 --> 00:03:46.310
 is a little bit dense this way 

00:03:44.989 --> 00:03:48.480
 can take advantage of the paintings of 

00:03:46.310 --> 00:03:52.190
 benasque 

00:03:48.480 --> 00:03:52.190
 that are not using 

00:03:52.200 --> 00:03:57.420
 although it's a bit difficult like 

00:03:54.870 --> 00:03:59.660
 spend it for example this abode is a 

00:03:57.420 --> 00:03:59.660
 little bit 

00:04:00.700 --> 00:04:07.150
 a little thick 

00:04:04.750 --> 00:04:10.710
 and let's give it a little touch with this 

00:04:07.150 --> 00:04:10.710
 metallic fuchsia 

00:04:16.299 --> 00:04:24.580
 and I already have a totally case 

00:04:19.560 --> 00:04:27.639
 pretty creative custom as well 

00:04:24.580 --> 00:04:30.820
 say it let's wait for it to dry and 

00:04:27.639 --> 00:04:34.210
 then the result 

00:04:30.820 --> 00:04:36.460
 that's how good has fallen remove him 

00:04:34.210 --> 00:04:41.080
 the pp then cited the manzanita follows 

00:04:36.460 --> 00:04:45.240
 there and here to place it 

00:04:41.080 --> 00:04:45.240
 like pretty original good 

00:04:45.950 --> 00:04:53.110
 and something that we can easily with 

00:04:48.380 --> 00:04:53.110
 enamel without spending too much 

00:04:54.090 --> 00:04:58.199
 and I hope you liked this tutorial 

00:04:55.889 --> 00:05:01.129
 in girls something super super simple 

00:04:58.199 --> 00:05:03.439
 but hey maybe it can be useful 

00:05:01.129 --> 00:05:06.729
 I hope you are having a great time and we 

00:05:03.439 --> 00:05:06.729
 we see in a next video 

00:05:09.100 --> 00:05:12.100
 ah
