it<00:00:52.920> on<00:00:53.010> a<00:00:53.039> canvas<00:00:53.399> I<00:00:53.910> think<00:00:54.210> two<00:00:54.329> canvases<00:00:54.600> are

00:00:54.950 --> 00:00:54.960 
it on a canvas I think two canvases are

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:57.920 
it on a canvas I think two canvases are
already<00:00:55.410> on<00:00:55.789> a<00:00:56.789> skateboard<00:00:57.180> and<00:00:57.750> they've

00:00:57.920 --> 00:00:57.930 
already on a skateboard and they've

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:00.740 
already on a skateboard and they've
still<00:00:58.199> got<00:00:58.410> it's<00:00:58.590> still<00:00:58.800> going<00:00:58.859> so<00:00:59.489> um<00:00:59.789> if<00:01:00.629> you

00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:00.750 
still got it's still going so um if you

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:02.630 
still got it's still going so um if you
can<00:01:00.930> find<00:01:01.140> these<00:01:01.350> pick<00:01:02.010> them<00:01:02.129> up<00:01:02.190> I<00:01:02.340> think<00:01:02.550> they

00:01:02.630 --> 00:01:02.640 
can find these pick them up I think they

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:05.630 
can find these pick them up I think they
should<00:01:02.879> be<00:01:02.969> an<00:01:03.120> arm<00:01:04.010> would<00:01:05.010> you<00:01:05.159> call<00:01:05.369> like<00:01:05.549> a

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:05.640 
should be an arm would you call like a

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:11.510 
should be an arm would you call like a
hobby<00:01:05.880> shop<00:01:07.670> here<00:01:08.670> would<00:01:09.180> be<00:01:09.360> a<00:01:09.500> art<00:01:10.500> line<00:01:10.710> 900

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:11.520 
hobby shop here would be a art line 900

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:14.960 
hobby shop here would be a art line 900

odd<00:01:19.700> when<00:01:20.700> you<00:01:20.790> press<00:01:21.210> the<00:01:21.420> nib<00:01:21.570> down<00:01:21.810> you<00:01:21.930> can

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:22.080 
odd when you press the nib down you can

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:24.109 
odd when you press the nib down you can
press<00:01:22.229> the<00:01:22.350> nib<00:01:22.560> down<00:01:22.740> like<00:01:23.700> in<00:01:23.790> the<00:01:23.880> middle<00:01:24.000> of

00:01:24.109 --> 00:01:24.119 
press the nib down like in the middle of

00:01:24.119 --> 00:01:25.280 
press the nib down like in the middle of
a<00:01:24.210> piece<00:01:24.420> if<00:01:24.600> it<00:01:24.689> seems<00:01:24.840> like<00:01:24.960> it's<00:01:25.080> thin<00:01:25.259> and

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:25.290 
a piece if it seems like it's thin and

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:28.819 
a piece if it seems like it's thin and
outer<00:01:25.530> streaking<00:01:26.040> it<00:01:26.700> will<00:01:26.850> probably<00:01:27.829> flood

00:01:28.819 --> 00:01:28.829 
outer streaking it will probably flood

00:01:28.829 --> 00:01:32.300 
outer streaking it will probably flood
your<00:01:28.950> whole<00:01:29.070> paper<00:01:29.280> with<00:01:29.610> ink<00:01:29.640> so<00:01:30.270> um<00:01:31.310> they're

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:32.310 
your whole paper with ink so um they're

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:35.450

markers<00:01:56.640> you<00:01:56.759> can<00:01:56.790> buy<00:01:57.060> um<00:01:57.350> I<00:01:58.350> think<00:01:58.829> they<00:01:59.250> make

00:01:59.450 --> 00:01:59.460 
markers you can buy um I think they make

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:02.660 
markers you can buy um I think they make
to<00:01:59.909> paint<00:02:00.210> markers<00:02:00.570> that<00:02:00.600> are<00:02:00.780> metallic<00:02:01.670> there

00:02:02.660 --> 00:02:02.670 
to paint markers that are metallic there

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:06.230 
to paint markers that are metallic there
goes<00:02:02.790> my<00:02:02.909> finger<00:02:03.540> um<00:02:04.880> metallic<00:02:05.880> markers

00:02:06.230 --> 00:02:06.240 
goes my finger um metallic markers

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:08.690 
goes my finger um metallic markers
but<00:02:06.540> on<00:02:06.840> I<00:02:07.259> don't<00:02:07.770> think<00:02:07.920> they<00:02:07.979> make<00:02:08.160> regular

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:08.700 
but on I don't think they make regular

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:10.400 
but on I don't think they make regular
color<00:02:09.030> paint<00:02:09.420> markers<00:02:09.750> like<00:02:09.899> greens<00:02:10.200> and

00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:10.410 
color paint markers like greens and

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:12.760 
color paint markers like greens and
 whatever

00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:12.770 
 whatever

00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:15.460 
 whatever
this<00:02:13.490> is<00:02:13.640> a<00:02:13.670> crank<00:02:13.910> a<00:02:14.030> 42<00:02:14.420> marker<00:02:14.750> I<00:02:14.930> think

00:02:15.460 --> 00:02:15.470 
this is a crank a 42 marker I think

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:17.740 
this is a crank a 42 marker I think
they're<00:02:15.560> usually<00:02:15.740> used<00:02:15.920> for<00:02:16.190> tagging<00:02:17.060> but<00:02:17.720> I

00:02:17.740 --> 00:02:17.750 
they're usually used for tagging but I

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:19.510 
they're usually used for tagging but I
use<00:02:18.080> them<00:02:18.260> on<00:02:18.410> my<00:02:18.530> black<00:02:18.740> book<00:02:18.980> and<00:02:19.190> stickers

00:02:19.510 --> 00:02:19.520 
use them on my black book and stickers

00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:22.870 
use them on my black book and stickers
because<00:02:19.730> they<00:02:20.320> last<00:02:21.320> forever<00:02:21.530> I<00:02:21.920> think<00:02:22.730> I<00:02:22.790> have

00:02:22.870 --> 00:02:22.880 
because they last forever I think I have

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:24.430 
because they last forever I think I have
a<00:02:22.940> sticker<00:02:23.150> right<00:02:23.390> up<00:02:23.570> now<00:02:23.810> on<00:02:23.840> the<00:02:24.080> street

00:02:24.430 --> 00:02:24.440 
a sticker right up now on the street

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:25.930 
a sticker right up now on the street
that<00:02:24.470> I<00:02:24.620> passed<00:02:24.920> by<00:02:25.160> and<00:02:25.400> it's<00:02:25.550> still<00:02:25.730> going

00:02:25.930 --> 00:02:25.940 
that I passed by and it's still going

00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:28.060 
that I passed by and it's still going
and<00:02:26.270> it<00:02:26.420> was<00:02:26.600> done<00:02:27.050> with<00:02:27.290> this<00:02:27.440> marker<00:02:27.860> here

00:02:28.060 --> 00:02:28.070 
and it was done with this marker here

00:02:28.070 --> 00:02:31.120 
and it was done with this marker here
and<00:02:28.480> they<00:02:29.480> last<00:02:29.780> forever<00:02:30.010> personally<00:02:31.010> I<00:02:31.100> think

00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:31.130 
and they last forever personally I think

00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:33.970 
and they last forever personally I think
they're<00:02:31.520> the<00:02:31.550> best<00:02:31.880> one<00:02:32.390> of<00:02:32.450> the<00:02:32.540> best<00:02:32.750> I'm<00:02:33.410> not

00:02:33.970 --> 00:02:33.980 
they're the best one of the best I'm not

00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:35.410 
they're the best one of the best I'm not
really<00:02:34.220> that<00:02:34.400> opaque<00:02:34.730> when<00:02:34.910> it<00:02:35.030> comes<00:02:35.210> to<00:02:35.330> the

00:02:35.410 --> 00:02:35.420 
really that opaque when it comes to the

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:38.650 
really that opaque when it comes to the
white<00:02:35.660> it's<00:02:35.960> the<00:02:36.890> best<00:02:37.300> opacity<00:02:38.300> from<00:02:38.450> a<00:02:38.480> white

00:02:38.650 --> 00:02:38.660 
white it's the best opacity from a white

00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:40.300 
white it's the best opacity from a white
that<00:02:38.840> I've<00:02:39.020> used<00:02:39.350> but<00:02:39.620> then<00:02:39.740> again<00:02:39.860> I've<00:02:40.130> only

00:02:40.300 --> 00:02:40.310 
that I've used but then again I've only

00:02:40.310 --> 00:02:42.940 
that I've used but then again I've only

00:05:53.539 --> 00:05:55.149 
have left that isn't empty and they are
refillable<00:05:53.990> but<00:05:54.349> they're<00:05:54.979> difficult

00:05:55.149 --> 00:05:55.159 
refillable but they're difficult
