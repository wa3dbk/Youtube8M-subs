00:01:09.039 --> 00:01:09.049 
so it's in liquid consistency because

00:01:09.049 --> 00:01:11.169 
so it's in liquid consistency because
then<00:01:09.350> it's<00:01:09.500> easier<00:01:09.979> mixed<00:01:10.580> in<00:01:10.729> with<00:01:10.880> the<00:01:11.030> wet

00:01:11.169 --> 00:01:11.179

so<00:04:54.180> the<00:04:54.300> next<00:04:54.480> step<00:04:54.780> is<00:04:55.050> to<00:04:55.560> have<00:04:55.740> a<00:04:55.770> tray<00:04:56.100> ready

00:04:56.390 --> 00:04:56.400 
so the next step is to have a tray ready

00:04:56.400 --> 00:04:59.810 
so the next step is to have a tray ready
with<00:04:56.910> some<00:04:57.150> parchment<00:04:57.480> lined<00:04:58.370> cups<00:04:59.370> so<00:04:59.790> that

00:04:59.810 --> 00:04:59.820 
with some parchment lined cups so that

00:04:59.820 --> 00:05:01.460 
with some parchment lined cups so that
you<00:05:00.000> can<00:05:00.120> put<00:05:00.300> the<00:05:00.390> batter<00:05:00.570> inside<00:05:01.020> the<00:05:01.140> crepes

00:05:01.460 --> 00:05:01.470 
you can put the batter inside the crepes

00:05:01.470 --> 00:05:03.110 
you can put the batter inside the crepes
and<00:05:01.770> make<00:05:02.340> sure<00:05:02.520> that<00:05:02.640> your<00:05:02.760> oven<00:05:02.790> is

00:05:03.110 --> 00:05:03.120 
and make sure that your oven is

preheated to 350 degrees

00:05:05.130 --> 00:05:08.120 
preheated to 350 degrees
so<00:05:05.910> now<00:05:06.060> I'm<00:05:06.390> going<00:05:06.660> to<00:05:06.840> take<00:05:07.080> my<00:05:07.470> batter<00:05:07.710> and

00:05:08.120 --> 00:05:08.130
