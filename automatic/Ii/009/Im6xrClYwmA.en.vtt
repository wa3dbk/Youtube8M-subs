00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.310
 hello everyone with you gameplay release 121 and 

00:00:03.300 --> 00:00:08.639
 the first screen is called o-pa-arena 

00:00:05.310 --> 00:00:11.759
 this is how you noticed us on the clone graph 

00:00:08.639 --> 00:00:15.150
 quake 3 and yes it really is this 

00:00:11.759 --> 00:00:17.279
 clone was made specifically for linux 

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:19.859
 and here we can choose cards 

00:00:17.279 --> 00:00:22.890
 yourself let's choose some where 

00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:26.220
 there are some bots here let's say 

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:29.010
 4 bots let's choose for us as 

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:30.119
 you can quickly run into them here 

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:32.940
 accordingly select the level 

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:33.510
 the complexity is all just like in the third 

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:37.050
 quake 

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:38.450
 and let's look at the game which 

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:40.860
 now we have loaded 

00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:44.640
 the management here is classic left 

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:47.340
 joystick on the right button shoot leading up 

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:50.820
 screens and turn in general this 

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:52.829
 full analog quake like you already burrow 

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:55.980
 noticed on the chart but maybe even 

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:57.690
 he better adam adapted to 

00:00:55.980 --> 00:01:00.660
 android me at least he 

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:03.030
 liked let's try someone 

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:04.010
 catch up and dunk let's take that here 

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:06.810
 heifer 

00:01:04.010 --> 00:01:08.909
 her name is okay let's 

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:11.790
 let's see what else there is in our 

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:13.890
 managing here we can what is it 

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:16.979
 does i don't know this button this one 

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:19.140
 the button allows us to choose this weapon 

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:21.810
 button allows us to change the view 

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:24.960
 accordingly, that's all actually 

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:28.200
 control here also has multiplayer 

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:30.799
 and full port but I have not tried it and not 

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:33.320
 I know it works or not me here 

00:01:30.799 --> 00:01:36.659
 soaked right on the easiest level 

00:01:33.320 --> 00:01:39.930
 so guys all download let's 

00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:45.240
 also hack into this great game 

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:47.759
 and the second game is called must quest 

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:49.470
 this is still a beta version but it is already available 

00:01:47.759 --> 00:01:51.600
 and you can play it let's start 

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:54.299
 continue this kind of such 

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:56.390
 rpk in which you need to go to wet 

00:01:54.299 --> 00:01:58.950
 different monsters and freaks and 

00:01:56.390 --> 00:02:02.009
 pumped over we play this 

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:05.299
 here is the wizard's gandalf and these barrels 

00:02:02.009 --> 00:02:07.979
 can not be turned and I did not know 

00:02:05.299 --> 00:02:10.530
 and here they can be here and so also 

00:02:07.979 --> 00:02:11.989
 shoot if we try anyway 

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:15.959
 them get there 

00:02:11.989 --> 00:02:18.980
 let's go ahead and see what 

00:02:15.959 --> 00:02:24.239
 waiting for us, I really, really want to show you 

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:26.040
 enemies and dunk them a couple here we are 

00:02:24.239 --> 00:02:29.819
 here we collect and then we took some 

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:32.459
 poisoned barrel and now we lose 

00:02:29.819 --> 00:02:34.800
 lives every second like that 

00:02:32.459 --> 00:02:36.959
 some slugs are green on us are running 

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:40.110
 we have to wet with our 

00:02:36.959 --> 00:02:43.319
 magic wand and thereby get 

00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:45.239
 experience and pumped over here itself 

00:02:43.319 --> 00:02:48.330
 such a cool game in principle from 

00:02:45.239 --> 00:02:49.170
 good enough i like these games on 

00:02:48.330 --> 00:02:51.330
 android 

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:52.769
 and so here's your advice and let's 

00:02:51.330 --> 00:02:56.670
 click here quickly 

00:02:52.769 --> 00:02:57.540
 but we did not have time we can press restart 

00:02:56.670 --> 00:03:00.390
 of this 

00:02:57.540 --> 00:03:03.300
 this location either continue this place 

00:03:00.390 --> 00:03:05.970
 but paid 100 gold naturally we 

00:03:03.300 --> 00:03:08.310
 nothing they will not pay and let's here 

00:03:05.970 --> 00:03:11.760
 Click on the character that there is in general 

00:03:08.310 --> 00:03:13.500
 that we can improve we see inventory 

00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:16.019
 see statistics 

00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:17.930
 so what is there we have a shop in 

00:03:16.019 --> 00:03:22.830
 which we can buy 

00:03:17.930 --> 00:03:25.319
 then there is this section in which we 

00:03:22.830 --> 00:03:29.790
 what can we do we can pump 

00:03:25.319 --> 00:03:32.549
 our weapons further we can return to 

00:03:29.790 --> 00:03:34.200
 a game that's actually is such a game that's in 

00:03:32.549 --> 00:03:38.519
 we are now the third level we 

00:03:34.200 --> 00:03:41.450
 have reached and we can only give it to you 

00:03:38.519 --> 00:03:46.319
 once advise all download it and 

00:03:41.450 --> 00:03:48.870
 go through 3 gran let's fly 

00:03:46.319 --> 00:03:51.720
 or hag, I do not know but also not the 

00:03:48.870 --> 00:03:53.519
 The essence of this game for those who showed that 

00:03:51.720 --> 00:03:56.580
 helicopter mission in gta wai city 

00:03:53.519 --> 00:03:59.159
 too easy and they would be her only way 

00:03:56.580 --> 00:04:01.500
 and passed in general here we need 

00:03:59.159 --> 00:04:04.049
 just like in gta wai city with 

00:04:01.500 --> 00:04:06.390
 using helicopter collect such 

00:04:04.049 --> 00:04:09.180
 like this any containers only 

00:04:06.390 --> 00:04:11.580
 they p and let's try now 

00:04:09.180 --> 00:04:14.370
 somehow neatly here at all 

00:04:11.580 --> 00:04:15.750
 you can't hit anything exactly 

00:04:14.370 --> 00:04:19.320
 get there 

00:04:15.750 --> 00:04:22.109
 Now it's once in a special way 

00:04:19.320 --> 00:04:25.500
 notch and then here is exactly the exact 

00:04:22.109 --> 00:04:28.830
 deliver the box and return to the landing 

00:04:25.500 --> 00:04:31.080
 where we actually flew from here 

00:04:28.830 --> 00:04:33.780
 such a game is a lot of mission 

00:04:31.080 --> 00:04:36.510
 further they will be much harder and 

00:04:33.780 --> 00:04:38.610
 harder great game all my tips 

00:04:36.510 --> 00:04:41.820
 the first level we went went for three 

00:04:38.610 --> 00:04:43.800
 asterisks and here in the second we unfortunately 

00:04:41.820 --> 00:04:45.080
 screwed up after that when this 

00:04:43.800 --> 00:04:47.790
 starlet 

00:04:45.080 --> 00:04:51.180
 tried to find their own such 

00:04:47.790 --> 00:04:53.640
 the game is called fly cargo download and 

00:04:51.180 --> 00:04:57.000
 fly here on this damn little 

00:04:53.640 --> 00:05:01.140
 Helicopter last grande valse a 

00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:03.210
 roger jolie go let's show you 

00:05:01.140 --> 00:05:06.630
 what kind of game is enough 

00:05:03.210 --> 00:05:08.070
 the interest is made and we will probably start with 

00:05:06.630 --> 00:05:10.590
 first mission 

00:05:08.070 --> 00:05:12.240
 what we need to do here we need 

00:05:10.590 --> 00:05:14.610
 just press the go button 

00:05:12.240 --> 00:05:17.220
 and here is this pen tag so happy 

00:05:14.610 --> 00:05:19.979
 very similar to the designer Lego goes 

00:05:17.220 --> 00:05:22.530
 picks up the keys thereby discovering yourself 

00:05:19.979 --> 00:05:24.090
 the door to the second location is the same 

00:05:22.530 --> 00:05:28.229
 the interesting thing is that the second location 

00:05:24.090 --> 00:05:30.810
 starts instantly and so you us 

00:05:28.229 --> 00:05:33.030
 Need to do naturally this pirate 

00:05:30.810 --> 00:05:35.160
 will walk from wall to wall and us 

00:05:33.030 --> 00:05:37.830
 need him how to make himself turn in 

00:05:35.160 --> 00:05:40.229
 the turn we can draw it with 

00:05:37.830 --> 00:05:43.290
 of this treasure chest 

00:05:40.229 --> 00:05:45.090
 so we place them click goal pirate 

00:05:43.290 --> 00:05:47.669
 naturally because the treasure can not 

00:05:45.090 --> 00:05:51.120
 stand before them and rush there 

00:05:47.669 --> 00:05:53.729
 where do we need this what is this 

00:05:51.120 --> 00:05:58.169
 special platform stepping on 

00:05:53.729 --> 00:06:01.440
 which pirate close you this passage and 

00:05:58.169 --> 00:06:04.080
 will be forced to turn like this 

00:06:01.440 --> 00:06:06.620
 interesting this game goes further 

00:06:04.080 --> 00:06:09.750
 everything will be much more difficult you will 

00:06:06.620 --> 00:06:13.169
 to completely bear the brain of this game 

00:06:09.750 --> 00:06:16.710
 and what do we need to do here 

00:06:13.169 --> 00:06:18.050
 here we try to put it here 

00:06:16.710 --> 00:06:22.909
 let's say 

00:06:18.050 --> 00:06:25.340
 golden chest over here and now why 

00:06:22.909 --> 00:06:28.129
 it was not put there like us 

00:06:25.340 --> 00:06:32.840
 delete it can be removed to us like this 

00:06:28.129 --> 00:06:35.810
 way too, too , tapping on it and so 

00:06:32.840 --> 00:06:39.979
 so 2 we stayed here put and here 

00:06:35.810 --> 00:06:43.220
 somehow we need yes damn a little you 

00:06:39.979 --> 00:06:45.530
 see this is a buggy here management 

00:06:43.220 --> 00:06:48.409
 I still managed to drink it and we need 

00:06:45.530 --> 00:06:50.750
 damn not here we need him well actually 

00:06:48.409 --> 00:06:53.240
 let's click heads see if all 

00:06:50.750 --> 00:06:55.550
 we did the right thing we did 

00:06:53.240 --> 00:06:58.129
 all right but now the last 

00:06:55.550 --> 00:07:00.860
 turn our dude turned and 

00:06:58.129 --> 00:07:03.590
 Actually, because of this, we lost the game. 

00:07:00.860 --> 00:07:06.289
 but by clicking on this button again we 

00:07:03.590 --> 00:07:09.830
 we return all to the same arrangements 

00:07:06.289 --> 00:07:12.219
 which we had in the beginning anyway I don't 

00:07:09.830 --> 00:07:15.409
 I can go there for some reason this 

00:07:12.219 --> 00:07:18.590
 fucking chest but the game is great for me 

00:07:15.409 --> 00:07:20.509
 really enjoyed it all advise everyone
