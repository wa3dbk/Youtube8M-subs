00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:10.200
 hello welcome picture 

00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:13.230
 Let's talk about how 

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:14.250
 exponential representation of numbers 

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:17.119
 complexes 

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:19.699
 we have already seen that the complex number z 

00:00:17.119 --> 00:00:24.449
 can be represented in its form 

00:00:19.699 --> 00:00:27.510
 algebra a + b ii can also be 

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:31.430
 represented in its form paste other 

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:37.250
 econometric ro that is the same way say 

00:00:31.430 --> 00:00:42.600
 times of theta that the argument say more 

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:45.149
 times being a tit and now we're going 

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:46.469
 to present the exponential form of 

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:49.200
 complex numbers 

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:52.950
 then this complex number z with the 

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:57.379
 module ro and try argument can also 

00:00:52.950 --> 00:01:02.370
 be represented as being 

00:00:57.379 --> 00:01:03.899
 sometimes try to 

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:07.280
 clothes and on the tit 

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:11.360
 but this is in the theta is equal to clothing times 

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:18.180
 80- node exponential we have to 

00:01:11.360 --> 00:01:25.409
 exponenciar date is equal to you in the 

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:27.810
 theta more and times being detected 

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:31.290
 advantage of representing the number 

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:33.720
 complete in its exponential form is that 

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:36.240
 all complex operations can be 

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:38.840
 made directly using the 

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:41.820
 properties of the exponential function 

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:45.479
 then as an example consider the number 

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:49.770
 z complex equal to 1 

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:53.299
 but then we have that in this case the 

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:59.490
 value of a in the form of jeb is equal to a 

00:01:53.299 --> 00:02:03.390
 the value of b is also equal we can 

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:07.530
 compute the module to say that it is 

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:11.069
 equal to ro as the square root of 

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:14.129
 aa2 more sellers 

00:02:11.069 --> 00:02:15.930
 and in this case is equal to the square root of 

00:02:14.129 --> 00:02:19.379
 a table that gives a 

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:22.980
 but a squared one that also gives a 

00:02:19.379 --> 00:02:27.209
 then it is equal to the square root of 2 

00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:29.790
 this is the module mo say or relative 

00:02:27.209 --> 00:02:36.150
 to the argument says peta 

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:42.689
 we have what you detect is equal to aa 

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:46.079
 on rot is equal to / more than 2 

00:02:42.689 --> 00:02:52.010
 ox ray from above and below it will give 

00:02:46.079 --> 00:02:57.659
 the root of 2 over two and the thea of ​​the theta 

00:02:52.010 --> 00:03:01.260
 is equal ab on ro that is also equal 

00:02:57.659 --> 00:03:05.129
 to 1 on root of 2 which can also be 

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:09.120
 described as being the root of 2 on 

00:03:05.129 --> 00:03:11.760
 two but the angle that has these 

00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:14.639
 values equal to the root of 2 

00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:18.720
 about pain and being also equal to 

00:03:14.639 --> 00:03:23.040
 publishers over two is 45 degrees as 

00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:27.139
 over four soon we have that tetam is 

00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:30.030
 equal to pis over 49 years 

00:03:27.139 --> 00:03:36.329
 then the form trained metrics 

00:03:30.030 --> 00:03:38.870
 number is zr1 equal to ro that is root of 

00:03:36.329 --> 00:03:42.930
 2 times 

00:03:38.870 --> 00:03:49.739
 cosine that is equal to who on 

00:03:42.930 --> 00:03:56.459
 four and more times being of theta and 

00:03:49.739 --> 00:04:02.479
 exponential form z equal to the street that it is worth 

00:03:56.459 --> 00:04:07.949
 root of 2 times is raised there times tries 

00:04:02.479 --> 00:04:10.739
 epe about four then these are the three 

00:04:07.949 --> 00:04:13.409
 ways to enter the same number 

00:04:10.739 --> 00:04:16.019
 complex having a mode equal to a radius 

00:04:13.409 --> 00:04:17.099
 of two arguments blow over four 

00:04:16.019 --> 00:04:21.139
 radian years 

00:04:17.099 --> 00:04:21.139
 This is a personal hug
