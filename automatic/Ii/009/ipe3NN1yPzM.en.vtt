00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.579 

this<00:00:00.329> is<00:00:00.480> something<00:00:00.750> a<00:00:00.840> lot<00:00:00.989> of<00:00:01.050> people<00:00:01.319> notice

00:00:01.579 --> 00:00:01.589 
this is something a lot of people notice

00:00:01.589 --> 00:00:03.139 
this is something a lot of people notice
but<00:00:02.040> never<00:00:02.190> really<00:00:02.399> think<00:00:02.610> about<00:00:02.669> and<00:00:02.970> that<00:00:03.090> is

00:00:03.139 --> 00:00:03.149 
but never really think about and that is

00:00:03.149 --> 00:00:05.869 
but never really think about and that is
in<00:00:03.360> lots<00:00:03.600> of<00:00:03.720> astronomical<00:00:04.140> photos<00:00:04.879> stars

00:00:05.869 --> 00:00:05.879 
in lots of astronomical photos stars

00:00:05.879 --> 00:00:07.970 
in lots of astronomical photos stars
have<00:00:06.359> these<00:00:06.540> nice<00:00:06.779> twinkly<00:00:07.500> bits<00:00:07.710> of<00:00:07.890> them

00:00:07.970 --> 00:00:07.980 
have these nice twinkly bits of them

00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:09.290 
have these nice twinkly bits of them
don't<00:00:08.189> little<00:00:08.460> spike<00:00:08.670> sticking<00:00:08.849> out<00:00:09.120> yeah

00:00:09.290 --> 00:00:09.300 
don't little spike sticking out yeah

00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:11.780 
don't little spike sticking out yeah
what's<00:00:09.690> that<00:00:09.900> all<00:00:09.990> about<00:00:10.019> so<00:00:10.530> it's<00:00:10.860> not<00:00:10.980> first

00:00:11.780 --> 00:00:11.790 
what's that all about so it's not first

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:13.039 
what's that all about so it's not first
thing<00:00:11.910> to<00:00:12.000> say<00:00:12.120> is<00:00:12.150> it's<00:00:12.360> not<00:00:12.450> real<00:00:12.660> in<00:00:12.960> the

00:00:13.039 --> 00:00:13.049 
thing to say is it's not real in the

00:00:13.049 --> 00:00:14.690 
thing to say is it's not real in the
sense<00:00:13.230> that<00:00:13.320> actually<00:00:13.620> stars<00:00:14.040> don't<00:00:14.250> have<00:00:14.490> bit

00:00:14.690 --> 00:00:14.700 
sense that actually stars don't have bit

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:16.460 
sense that actually stars don't have bit
sticking<00:00:15.000> out<00:00:15.150> to<00:00:15.240> the<00:00:15.330> sign<00:00:15.509> like<00:00:15.690> that<00:00:15.750> it's

00:00:16.460 --> 00:00:16.470 
sticking out to the sign like that it's

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:17.660 
sticking out to the sign like that it's
an<00:00:16.560> artifact<00:00:16.980> of<00:00:17.100> the<00:00:17.190> way<00:00:17.279> you<00:00:17.340> take<00:00:17.640> the

00:00:17.660 --> 00:00:17.670 
an artifact of the way you take the

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:19.519 
an artifact of the way you take the
picture<00:00:18.060> this<00:00:18.660> thing<00:00:18.840> called<00:00:19.020> of<00:00:19.140> diffraction

00:00:19.519 --> 00:00:19.529 
picture this thing called of diffraction

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:22.189 
picture this thing called of diffraction
spike<00:00:20.240> and<00:00:21.240> essentially<00:00:21.660> so<00:00:21.779> we<00:00:21.869> need<00:00:22.050> to<00:00:22.109> go

00:00:22.189 --> 00:00:22.199 
spike and essentially so we need to go

00:00:22.199 --> 00:00:23.330 
spike and essentially so we need to go
back<00:00:22.320> up<00:00:22.439> a<00:00:22.529> little<00:00:22.920> bit<00:00:23.130> and<00:00:23.220> talk<00:00:23.279> about

00:00:23.330 --> 00:00:23.340 
back up a little bit and talk about

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:25.130 
back up a little bit and talk about
diffraction<00:00:23.730> basically<00:00:24.420> diffraction<00:00:24.930> is<00:00:25.050> the

00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:25.140 
diffraction basically diffraction is the

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:26.929 
diffraction basically diffraction is the
effect<00:00:25.439> where<00:00:25.769> so<00:00:26.369> if<00:00:26.490> you've<00:00:26.580> got<00:00:26.670> just<00:00:26.820> a

00:00:26.929 --> 00:00:26.939 
effect where so if you've got just a

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:29.240 
effect where so if you've got just a
plain<00:00:27.570> wave<00:00:27.810> of<00:00:27.990> light<00:00:28.199> coming<00:00:28.590> along<00:00:28.800> so<00:00:29.010> just

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:29.250 
plain wave of light coming along so just

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:30.919 
plain wave of light coming along so just
the<00:00:29.310> one<00:00:29.400> just<00:00:29.760> a<00:00:29.849> plain<00:00:30.300> wave<00:00:30.510> just<00:00:30.689> a<00:00:30.810> wave

00:00:30.919 --> 00:00:30.929 
the one just a plain wave just a wave

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:32.720 
the one just a plain wave just a wave
like<00:00:31.140> this<00:00:31.320> right<00:00:31.529> then<00:00:31.949> it'll<00:00:32.399> just<00:00:32.430> kind<00:00:32.700> of

00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:32.730 
like this right then it'll just kind of

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:33.830 
like this right then it'll just kind of
propagate<00:00:33.120> in<00:00:33.210> a<00:00:33.270> straight<00:00:33.480> line<00:00:33.510> forever

00:00:33.830 --> 00:00:33.840 
propagate in a straight line forever

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:35.959 
propagate in a straight line forever
however<00:00:34.710> if<00:00:34.950> you<00:00:35.040> put<00:00:35.190> an<00:00:35.309> aperture<00:00:35.610> in<00:00:35.760> the

00:00:35.959 --> 00:00:35.969 
however if you put an aperture in the

00:00:35.969 --> 00:00:37.729 
however if you put an aperture in the
way<00:00:36.090> then<00:00:37.020> actually<00:00:37.290> what<00:00:37.380> happens<00:00:37.680> is

00:00:37.729 --> 00:00:37.739 
way then actually what happens is

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:38.930 
way then actually what happens is
obviously<00:00:38.040> the<00:00:38.250> light<00:00:38.399> that's<00:00:38.579> not<00:00:38.700> going

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:38.940 
obviously the light that's not going

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:40.160 
obviously the light that's not going
through<00:00:39.059> the<00:00:39.149> aperture<00:00:39.420> gets<00:00:39.660> stopped<00:00:39.960> the

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:40.170 
through the aperture gets stopped the

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:41.150 
through the aperture gets stopped the
light<00:00:40.320> that's<00:00:40.440> going<00:00:40.680> through<00:00:40.739> the<00:00:40.890> aperture

00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:41.160 
light that's going through the aperture

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:42.590 
light that's going through the aperture
gets<00:00:41.340> through<00:00:41.550> but<00:00:42.000> as<00:00:42.120> it<00:00:42.210> comes<00:00:42.360> out<00:00:42.480> the

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:42.600 
gets through but as it comes out the

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:43.940 
gets through but as it comes out the
other<00:00:42.690> side<00:00:42.840> it<00:00:43.050> spreads<00:00:43.410> out<00:00:43.559> on<00:00:43.770> the<00:00:43.860> other

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:43.950 
other side it spreads out on the other

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:45.049 
other side it spreads out on the other
side<00:00:44.040> that's<00:00:44.520> a<00:00:44.610> phenomenon<00:00:45.000> called

00:00:45.049 --> 00:00:45.059 
side that's a phenomenon called

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:47.090 
side that's a phenomenon called
diffraction<00:00:45.480> that<00:00:46.170> whenever<00:00:46.469> you<00:00:46.649> block<00:00:46.950> the

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:47.100 
diffraction that whenever you block the

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:49.310 
diffraction that whenever you block the
path<00:00:47.280> of<00:00:47.430> light<00:00:47.640> a<00:00:47.850> plane<00:00:48.180> wave<00:00:48.390> stops<00:00:48.989> being<00:00:49.200> a

00:00:49.310 --> 00:00:49.320 
path of light a plane wave stops being a

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:51.260 
path of light a plane wave stops being a
plane<00:00:49.500> wave<00:00:49.710> and<00:00:49.950> remember<00:00:50.700> our<00:00:50.820> plane<00:00:51.000> waves

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:51.270 
plane wave and remember our plane waves

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:53.119 
plane wave and remember our plane waves
what<00:00:51.510> you<00:00:51.600> get<00:00:51.780> from<00:00:51.870> a<00:00:52.020> point<00:00:52.260> like<00:00:52.469> objects

00:00:53.119 --> 00:00:53.129 
what you get from a point like objects

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:54.229 
what you get from a point like objects
if<00:00:53.190> you<00:00:53.219> got<00:00:53.340> a<00:00:53.370> point<00:00:53.520> light<00:00:53.730> object<00:00:54.059> a<00:00:54.120> long

00:00:54.229 --> 00:00:54.239 
if you got a point light object a long

00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:55.880 
if you got a point light object a long
way<00:00:54.390> away<00:00:54.510> the<00:00:55.079> light<00:00:55.230> that<00:00:55.410> comes<00:00:55.530> to<00:00:55.649> us<00:00:55.680> is

00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:55.890 
way away the light that comes to us is

00:00:55.890 --> 00:00:58.670 
way away the light that comes to us is
pretty<00:00:56.010> much<00:00:56.219> planar<00:00:56.579> and<00:00:56.879> so<00:00:57.660> that's<00:00:58.230> how<00:00:58.379> you

00:00:58.670 --> 00:00:58.680 
pretty much planar and so that's how you

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:00.200 
pretty much planar and so that's how you
know<00:00:58.800> when<00:00:58.949> you<00:00:59.039> detect<00:00:59.460> a<00:00:59.579> plane<00:00:59.760> wave<00:00:59.969> that

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:00.210 
know when you detect a plane wave that

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:01.459 
know when you detect a plane wave that
tells<00:01:00.420> you<00:01:00.510> there's<00:01:00.690> a<00:01:00.719> point<00:01:00.960> like<00:01:01.079> object

00:01:01.459 --> 00:01:01.469 
tells you there's a point like object

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:02.569 
tells you there's a point like object
back<00:01:01.620> there<00:01:01.829> and<00:01:02.010> when<00:01:02.160> you<00:01:02.250> take<00:01:02.370> a<00:01:02.399> picture

00:01:02.569 --> 00:01:02.579 
back there and when you take a picture

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:03.740 
back there and when you take a picture
you<00:01:02.730> see<00:01:02.910> a<00:01:02.969> point<00:01:03.180> like<00:01:03.300> object<00:01:03.600> of<00:01:03.690> course

00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:03.750 
you see a point like object of course

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:05.090 
you see a point like object of course
when<00:01:04.199> it's<00:01:04.320> come<00:01:04.470> through<00:01:04.500> the<00:01:04.680> other<00:01:04.799> side<00:01:04.979> is

00:01:05.090 --> 00:01:05.100 
when it's come through the other side is

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:06.289 
when it's come through the other side is
no<00:01:05.220> longer<00:01:05.460> a<00:01:05.549> plane<00:01:05.790> wave<00:01:05.970> it's<00:01:06.180> now

00:01:06.289 --> 00:01:06.299 
no longer a plane wave it's now

00:01:06.299 --> 00:01:07.880 
no longer a plane wave it's now
spreading<00:01:06.630> out<00:01:06.810> so<00:01:07.350> if<00:01:07.409> you<00:01:07.500> just<00:01:07.680> have<00:01:07.860> a

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:07.890 
spreading out so if you just have a

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:10.039 
spreading out so if you just have a
round<00:01:08.220> hole<00:01:08.490> for<00:01:09.000> example<00:01:09.360> a<00:01:09.390> telescope<00:01:09.840> with

00:01:10.039 --> 00:01:10.049 
round hole for example a telescope with

00:01:10.049 --> 00:01:12.320 
round hole for example a telescope with
a<00:01:10.470> light<00:01:10.710> going<00:01:10.890> in<00:01:11.130> the<00:01:11.610> diffraction<00:01:11.909> you<00:01:12.150> get

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:12.330 
a light going in the diffraction you get

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:13.850 
a light going in the diffraction you get
a<00:01:12.360> famous<00:01:12.840> thing<00:01:12.960> called<00:01:13.140> an<00:01:13.229> airy<00:01:13.409> pan<00:01:13.710> you

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:13.860 
a famous thing called an airy pan you

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:14.960 
a famous thing called an airy pan you
end<00:01:13.979> up<00:01:14.040> with<00:01:14.159> a<00:01:14.189> spike<00:01:14.460> in<00:01:14.640> the<00:01:14.700> middle<00:01:14.729> and

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:14.970 
end up with a spike in the middle and

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:17.210 
end up with a spike in the middle and
then<00:01:15.060> a<00:01:15.090> series<00:01:15.360> of<00:01:15.600> rings<00:01:15.780> around<00:01:15.990> it<00:01:16.350> and<00:01:16.530> so

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:17.220 
then a series of rings around it and so

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:18.410 
then a series of rings around it and so
the<00:01:17.340> diffraction<00:01:17.610> pattern<00:01:17.790> you<00:01:18.090> would<00:01:18.210> really

00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:18.420 
the diffraction pattern you would really

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:19.880 
the diffraction pattern you would really
get<00:01:18.689> if<00:01:18.869> you<00:01:18.990> could<00:01:19.110> produce<00:01:19.290> the<00:01:19.560> most

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:19.890 
get if you could produce the most

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:21.800 
get if you could produce the most
perfect<00:01:20.460> image<00:01:20.700> you<00:01:20.790> could<00:01:20.970> with<00:01:21.390> a<00:01:21.420> telescope

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:21.810 
perfect image you could with a telescope

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:24.109 
perfect image you could with a telescope
that<00:01:21.930> was<00:01:22.020> just<00:01:22.259> a<00:01:22.350> round<00:01:22.950> aperture<00:01:23.430> would<00:01:23.939> be

00:01:24.109 --> 00:01:24.119 
that was just a round aperture would be

00:01:24.119 --> 00:01:25.399 
that was just a round aperture would be
that<00:01:24.299> structure<00:01:24.689> would<00:01:24.750> be<00:01:24.900> a<00:01:24.930> spike<00:01:25.170> in<00:01:25.350> a

00:01:25.399 --> 00:01:25.409 
that structure would be a spike in a

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:27.109 
that structure would be a spike in a
series<00:01:25.680> of<00:01:25.710> rings<00:01:25.950> you<00:01:26.220> very<00:01:26.700> rarely<00:01:26.939> see

00:01:27.109 --> 00:01:27.119 
series of rings you very rarely see

00:01:27.119 --> 00:01:28.370 
series of rings you very rarely see
those<00:01:27.420> rings<00:01:27.689> because<00:01:27.930> at<00:01:28.080> least<00:01:28.140> when<00:01:28.259> you're

00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:28.380 
those rings because at least when you're

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:30.440 
those rings because at least when you're
taking<00:01:28.650> a<00:01:28.710> picture<00:01:29.070> from<00:01:29.430> the<00:01:29.579> ground<00:01:29.820> then

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:30.450 
taking a picture from the ground then

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:31.880 
taking a picture from the ground then
the<00:01:30.540> atmosphere<00:01:30.930> messes<00:01:31.290> things<00:01:31.439> up<00:01:31.619> to<00:01:31.770> such

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:31.890 
the atmosphere messes things up to such

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:33.260 
the atmosphere messes things up to such
an<00:01:32.009> extent<00:01:32.250> that<00:01:32.340> that<00:01:32.430> blurs<00:01:32.729> all<00:01:32.939> that<00:01:33.119> out

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:33.270 
an extent that that blurs all that out

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:35.450 
an extent that that blurs all that out
so<00:01:33.450> you<00:01:33.479> lose<00:01:33.810> all<00:01:33.990> that<00:01:34.110> okay<00:01:35.070> so<00:01:35.130> that's<00:01:35.340> the

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:35.460 
so you lose all that okay so that's the

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:37.370 
so you lose all that okay so that's the
basics<00:01:35.790> of<00:01:35.850> diffraction<00:01:36.119> now<00:01:36.840> unfortunately

00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:37.380 
basics of diffraction now unfortunately

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:38.960 
basics of diffraction now unfortunately
in<00:01:37.890> telescopes<00:01:38.340> there<00:01:38.520> are<00:01:38.640> other<00:01:38.790> things

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:38.970 
in telescopes there are other things

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:40.550 
in telescopes there are other things
going<00:01:39.119> on<00:01:39.390> it's<00:01:39.570> not<00:01:39.689> just<00:01:39.750> the<00:01:40.140> circular

00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:40.560 
going on it's not just the circular

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:42.889 
going on it's not just the circular
aperture<00:01:40.799> and<00:01:41.130> for<00:01:41.640> example<00:01:42.090> the<00:01:42.540> kind<00:01:42.780> of

00:01:42.889 --> 00:01:42.899 
aperture and for example the kind of

00:01:42.899 --> 00:01:44.420 
aperture and for example the kind of
reflecting<00:01:43.380> telescopes<00:01:43.829> we<00:01:43.979> typically<00:01:44.310> use

these four vanes they're called are

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:57.230 
these four vanes they're called are

in<00:01:57.420> very<00:01:57.780> precise<00:01:58.290> alignment<00:01:58.920> there<00:01:59.009> is

00:01:59.090 --> 00:01:59.100 
in very precise alignment there is

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:02.050

the job of these four pieces of metal is

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:06.260 
the job of these four pieces of metal is
to<00:02:04.829> actually<00:02:05.070> hold<00:02:05.219> the<00:02:05.369> secondary<00:02:05.820> mirror<00:02:06.030> in

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:06.270 
to actually hold the secondary mirror in

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:08.960 
to actually hold the secondary mirror in
a<00:02:06.479> very<00:02:06.740> fixed<00:02:07.740> position<00:02:08.429> so<00:02:08.729> you've<00:02:08.849> got<00:02:08.940> a

00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:08.970 
a very fixed position so you've got a

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:10.249 
a very fixed position so you've got a
big<00:02:09.209> mirror<00:02:09.420> at<00:02:09.569> the<00:02:09.660> bottom<00:02:09.899> and<00:02:10.140> a<00:02:10.229> little

00:02:10.249 --> 00:02:10.259 
big mirror at the bottom and a little

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:12.380 
big mirror at the bottom and a little
mirror<00:02:10.679> at<00:02:11.160> the<00:02:11.280> top<00:02:11.459> and<00:02:11.700> the<00:02:11.970> little<00:02:12.180> mirror

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:12.390 
mirror at the top and the little mirror

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:13.800 
mirror at the top and the little mirror
actually<00:02:12.569> abstract<00:02:13.080> some<00:02:13.290> of<00:02:13.410> the<00:02:13.470> light

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:13.810 
actually abstract some of the light

00:02:13.810 --> 00:02:15.300 
actually abstract some of the light
coming<00:02:13.959> through<00:02:14.110> so<00:02:14.290> the<00:02:14.440> immediately<00:02:15.130> we<00:02:15.190> got

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:15.310 
coming through so the immediately we got

00:02:15.310 --> 00:02:16.770 
coming through so the immediately we got
an<00:02:15.370> aperture<00:02:15.550> with<00:02:15.880> a<00:02:15.910> further<00:02:16.209> obstruction

00:02:16.770 --> 00:02:16.780 
an aperture with a further obstruction

00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:18.330 
an aperture with a further obstruction
in<00:02:16.870> the<00:02:16.930> middle<00:02:17.140> of<00:02:17.200> it<00:02:17.349> turns<00:02:17.980> out<00:02:18.130> that<00:02:18.220> it's

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:18.340 
in the middle of it turns out that it's

00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:20.250 
in the middle of it turns out that it's
not<00:02:18.400> the<00:02:18.610> thing<00:02:18.760> that<00:02:18.790> does<00:02:19.030> the<00:02:19.060> damage<00:02:19.660> the

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:20.260 
not the thing that does the damage the

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:21.540 
not the thing that does the damage the
thing<00:02:20.440> that<00:02:20.560> does<00:02:20.709> the<00:02:20.739> damage<00:02:20.860> is<00:02:21.280> you<00:02:21.400> need

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:21.550 
thing that does the damage is you need

00:02:21.550 --> 00:02:23.010 
thing that does the damage is you need
something<00:02:21.880> to<00:02:21.970> hold<00:02:22.120> that<00:02:22.360> little<00:02:22.510> mirror<00:02:22.870> up

00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:23.020 
something to hold that little mirror up

00:02:23.020 --> 00:02:24.540 
something to hold that little mirror up
so<00:02:23.530> you<00:02:23.590> have<00:02:23.709> these<00:02:23.830> things<00:02:23.980> called<00:02:24.099> struts

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:24.550 
so you have these things called struts

00:02:24.550 --> 00:02:26.160 
so you have these things called struts
just<00:02:24.880> basically<00:02:25.120> supports<00:02:25.660> that<00:02:25.840> hold<00:02:25.959> them

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:26.170 
just basically supports that hold them

00:02:26.170 --> 00:02:28.170 
just basically supports that hold them
up<00:02:26.290> in<00:02:26.739> a<00:02:26.950> typical<00:02:27.340> telescope<00:02:27.760> there<00:02:27.940> are<00:02:28.030> four

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:28.180 
up in a typical telescope there are four

00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:29.820 
up in a typical telescope there are four
of<00:02:28.330> them<00:02:28.450> that<00:02:28.720> stick<00:02:28.959> out<00:02:29.080> on<00:02:29.319> the<00:02:29.440> other<00:02:29.590> side

00:02:29.820 --> 00:02:29.830 
of them that stick out on the other side

00:02:29.830 --> 00:02:31.559 
of them that stick out on the other side
which<00:02:30.370> block<00:02:30.640> a<00:02:30.670> bit<00:02:30.849> more<00:02:31.030> or<00:02:31.150> the<00:02:31.239> light<00:02:31.420> the

00:02:31.559 --> 00:02:31.569 
which block a bit more or the light the

00:02:31.569 --> 00:02:32.910 
which block a bit more or the light the
light<00:02:31.599> goes<00:02:31.870> past<00:02:32.140> them<00:02:32.319> goes<00:02:32.530> past<00:02:32.800> these

00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:32.920 
light goes past them goes past these

00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:34.620 
light goes past them goes past these
struts<00:02:33.280> and<00:02:33.430> actually<00:02:33.670> diffracts<00:02:34.180> because

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:34.630 
struts and actually diffracts because

00:02:34.630 --> 00:02:36.150 
struts and actually diffracts because
it's<00:02:34.780> gone<00:02:34.900> past<00:02:35.080> another<00:02:35.380> obstruction<00:02:36.010> and

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:36.160 
it's gone past another obstruction and

00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:38.400 
it's gone past another obstruction and
that<00:02:36.640> further<00:02:36.940> messes<00:02:37.330> up<00:02:37.450> the<00:02:37.569> image<00:02:37.810> and<00:02:37.930> the

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:38.410 
that further messes up the image and the

00:02:38.410 --> 00:02:40.350 
that further messes up the image and the

00:02:40.350 --> 00:02:40.360 
net effect of those struts is to create

00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:42.570 
net effect of those struts is to create
those<00:02:40.540> four<00:02:40.810> spikes<00:02:41.170> that<00:02:41.470> you<00:02:41.590> see<00:02:41.800> on<00:02:42.519> a

00:02:42.570 --> 00:02:42.580 
those four spikes that you see on a

00:02:42.580 --> 00:02:44.430 
those four spikes that you see on a
typical<00:02:42.819> telescope<00:02:43.390> image<00:02:43.660> it's<00:02:43.930> nothing<00:02:44.319> to

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:44.440 
typical telescope image it's nothing to

00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:46.199 
typical telescope image it's nothing to
do<00:02:44.590> with<00:02:44.709> the<00:02:44.830> stars<00:02:45.099> themselves<00:02:45.700> is<00:02:45.819> just<00:02:46.090> the

do with the stars themselves is just the

00:02:46.209 --> 00:02:47.880 
do with the stars themselves is just the

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:49.930 
effect and in fact you can even tell

00:02:49.930 --> 00:02:51.570 
effect and in fact you can even tell
what<00:02:50.319> the<00:02:50.440> telescope<00:02:50.860> is<00:02:51.040> that's<00:02:51.250> taking<00:02:51.489> the

00:02:51.570 --> 00:02:51.580 
what the telescope is that's taking the

00:02:51.580 --> 00:02:52.979 
what the telescope is that's taking the
picture<00:02:51.819> sometimes<00:02:52.000> because<00:02:52.540> different

00:02:52.979 --> 00:02:52.989 
picture sometimes because different

00:02:52.989 --> 00:02:54.030 
picture sometimes because different
telescopes<00:02:53.230> have<00:02:53.560> different<00:02:53.920> support

00:02:54.030 --> 00:02:54.040 
telescopes have different support

00:02:54.040 --> 00:02:55.860 
telescopes have different support
structures<00:02:54.580> up<00:02:54.700> there<00:02:54.880> so<00:02:55.360> for<00:02:55.510> example

00:02:55.860 --> 00:02:55.870 
structures up there so for example

00:02:55.870 --> 00:02:58.199 
structures up there so for example
famously<00:02:56.350> the<00:02:56.560> Keck<00:02:56.830> telescopes<00:02:57.310> out<00:02:57.580> in

00:02:58.199 --> 00:02:58.209 
famously the Keck telescopes out in

00:02:58.209 --> 00:03:01.020 
famously the Keck telescopes out in
Hawaii<00:02:58.510> have<00:02:59.200> a<00:02:59.230> they're<00:02:59.920> built<00:03:00.099> almost

00:03:01.020 --> 00:03:01.030 
Hawaii have a they're built almost

00:03:01.030 --> 00:03:02.430 
Hawaii have a they're built almost
entirely<00:03:01.420> on<00:03:01.599> a<00:03:01.630> kind<00:03:01.840> of<00:03:01.900> hexagonal

00:03:02.430 --> 00:03:02.440 
entirely on a kind of hexagonal

00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:03.570 
entirely on a kind of hexagonal
structure<00:03:02.830> and<00:03:03.010> that<00:03:03.250> means<00:03:03.430> they<00:03:03.519> actually

00:03:03.570 --> 00:03:03.580 
structure and that means they actually

00:03:03.580 --> 00:03:05.580 
structure and that means they actually
have<00:03:03.849> six<00:03:04.120> struts<00:03:04.569> around<00:03:04.930> their<00:03:05.200> secondary

00:03:05.580 --> 00:03:05.590 
have six struts around their secondary

00:03:05.590 --> 00:03:07.170 
have six struts around their secondary
mirror<00:03:05.860> and<00:03:06.069> so<00:03:06.489> actually<00:03:06.790> if<00:03:06.849> you<00:03:06.940> look<00:03:06.970> at

00:03:07.170 --> 00:03:07.180 
mirror and so actually if you look at

00:03:07.180 --> 00:03:08.580 
mirror and so actually if you look at
the<00:03:07.269> diffraction<00:03:07.569> spikes<00:03:07.989> you<00:03:08.140> get<00:03:08.290> from<00:03:08.440> them

00:03:08.580 --> 00:03:08.590 
the diffraction spikes you get from them

00:03:08.590 --> 00:03:10.559 
the diffraction spikes you get from them
they're<00:03:09.099> at<00:03:09.220> sixty<00:03:09.549> degree<00:03:09.849> intervals<00:03:10.330> rather

00:03:10.559 --> 00:03:10.569 
they're at sixty degree intervals rather

00:03:10.569 --> 00:03:11.880 
they're at sixty degree intervals rather
than<00:03:10.720> at<00:03:10.810> a<00:03:10.840> ninety<00:03:11.170> degree<00:03:11.260> interval<00:03:11.709> so<00:03:11.799> you

00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:11.890 
than at a ninety degree interval so you

00:03:11.890 --> 00:03:12.900 
than at a ninety degree interval so you
have<00:03:11.980> a<00:03:12.040> different<00:03:12.370> pattern<00:03:12.549> of<00:03:12.700> diffraction

00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:12.910 
have a different pattern of diffraction

00:03:12.910 --> 00:03:15.660 
have a different pattern of diffraction
just<00:03:13.540> depending<00:03:13.900> on<00:03:14.019> what<00:03:14.170> the<00:03:14.580> pattern<00:03:15.580> of

00:03:15.660 --> 00:03:15.670 
just depending on what the pattern of

00:03:15.670 --> 00:03:16.860 
just depending on what the pattern of
the<00:03:15.760> struts<00:03:16.030> is<00:03:16.180> how<00:03:16.299> the<00:03:16.360> struts<00:03:16.720> are

00:03:16.860 --> 00:03:16.870 
the struts is how the struts are

00:03:16.870 --> 00:03:18.449 
the struts is how the struts are
arranged<00:03:17.230> around<00:03:17.349> if<00:03:17.950> you<00:03:18.040> think<00:03:18.190> about<00:03:18.310> just

00:03:18.449 --> 00:03:18.459 
arranged around if you think about just

00:03:18.459 --> 00:03:20.640 
arranged around if you think about just
one<00:03:18.670> strut<00:03:19.060> as<00:03:19.239> the<00:03:19.420> light<00:03:19.600> goes<00:03:19.840> past<00:03:20.230> it<00:03:20.470> of

00:03:20.640 --> 00:03:20.650 
one strut as the light goes past it of

00:03:20.650 --> 00:03:21.930 
one strut as the light goes past it of
course<00:03:20.829> you've<00:03:21.010> got<00:03:21.040> a<00:03:21.130> plain<00:03:21.370> wave<00:03:21.579> of<00:03:21.760> light

00:03:21.930 --> 00:03:21.940 
course you've got a plain wave of light

00:03:21.940 --> 00:03:24.270 
course you've got a plain wave of light
approaching<00:03:22.239> this<00:03:22.600> strut<00:03:23.130> you'll<00:03:24.130> have<00:03:24.250> a

00:03:24.270 --> 00:03:24.280 
approaching this strut you'll have a

00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:25.860 
approaching this strut you'll have a
plain<00:03:24.519> wave<00:03:24.700> comes<00:03:25.000> at<00:03:25.150> passed<00:03:25.390> here<00:03:25.600> a<00:03:25.630> plain

00:03:25.860 --> 00:03:25.870 
plain wave comes at passed here a plain

00:03:25.870 --> 00:03:27.330 
plain wave comes at passed here a plain
wave<00:03:26.019> comes<00:03:26.230> here<00:03:26.560> this<00:03:26.680> bit<00:03:26.950> in<00:03:27.130> the<00:03:27.250> middle

00:03:27.330 --> 00:03:27.340 
wave comes here this bit in the middle

00:03:27.340 --> 00:03:29.400 
wave comes here this bit in the middle
where<00:03:27.670> the<00:03:27.760> strut<00:03:27.940> was<00:03:28.090> gets<00:03:28.299> blocked<00:03:28.540> and<00:03:28.900> so

00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:29.410 
where the strut was gets blocked and so

00:03:29.410 --> 00:03:30.840 
where the strut was gets blocked and so
again<00:03:29.650> what<00:03:29.890> happens<00:03:30.250> as<00:03:30.340> the<00:03:30.459> light<00:03:30.609> goes

00:03:30.840 --> 00:03:30.850 
again what happens as the light goes

00:03:30.850 --> 00:03:32.610 
again what happens as the light goes
past<00:03:31.150> the<00:03:31.329> strut<00:03:31.569> it<00:03:31.720> starts<00:03:32.049> to<00:03:32.140> spread<00:03:32.440> out

00:03:32.610 --> 00:03:32.620 
past the strut it starts to spread out

00:03:32.620 --> 00:03:34.140 
past the strut it starts to spread out
on<00:03:32.799> the<00:03:32.920> other<00:03:33.010> side<00:03:33.130> so<00:03:33.579> the<00:03:33.670> light<00:03:33.819> that<00:03:33.940> gets

00:03:34.140 --> 00:03:34.150 
on the other side so the light that gets

00:03:34.150 --> 00:03:36.090 
on the other side so the light that gets
passed<00:03:34.450> because<00:03:35.170> it's<00:03:35.319> now<00:03:35.410> gone<00:03:35.620> past<00:03:35.920> an

00:03:36.090 --> 00:03:36.100 
passed because it's now gone past an

00:03:36.100 --> 00:03:37.500 
passed because it's now gone past an
obstruction<00:03:36.549> will<00:03:36.700> start<00:03:36.910> to<00:03:37.000> spread<00:03:37.239> out<00:03:37.359> on

00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:37.510 
obstruction will start to spread out on

00:03:37.510 --> 00:03:38.699 
obstruction will start to spread out on
the<00:03:37.569> other<00:03:37.660> side<00:03:37.900> so<00:03:38.049> it<00:03:38.140> will<00:03:38.260> cease<00:03:38.440> to<00:03:38.470> be<00:03:38.590> a

00:03:38.699 --> 00:03:38.709 
the other side so it will cease to be a

00:03:38.709 --> 00:03:40.380 
the other side so it will cease to be a
plain<00:03:38.920> wave<00:03:39.160> and<00:03:39.400> the<00:03:40.060> light<00:03:40.239> that's

00:03:40.380 --> 00:03:40.390 
plain wave and the light that's

00:03:40.390 --> 00:03:41.640 
plain wave and the light that's
spreading<00:03:40.690> out<00:03:40.840> from<00:03:40.870> this<00:03:41.140> side<00:03:41.350> and<00:03:41.560> the

00:03:41.640 --> 00:03:41.650 
spreading out from this side and the

00:03:41.650 --> 00:03:42.599 
spreading out from this side and the
light<00:03:41.799> that's<00:03:41.920> spreading<00:03:42.190> out<00:03:42.340> from<00:03:42.370> this

00:03:42.599 --> 00:03:42.609 
light that's spreading out from this

00:03:42.609 --> 00:03:44.250 
light that's spreading out from this
side<00:03:42.670> all<00:03:43.060> interferes<00:03:43.540> with<00:03:43.720> each<00:03:43.840> other<00:03:44.049> and

00:03:44.250 --> 00:03:44.260 
side all interferes with each other and

00:03:44.260 --> 00:03:45.960 
side all interferes with each other and
so<00:03:44.709> the<00:03:44.859> net<00:03:45.100> effect<00:03:45.489> of<00:03:45.609> all<00:03:45.730> that

00:03:45.960 --> 00:03:45.970 
so the net effect of all that

00:03:45.970 --> 00:03:47.610 
so the net effect of all that
interference<00:03:46.569> is<00:03:46.750> to<00:03:46.870> produce<00:03:47.019> those<00:03:47.350> big

00:03:47.610 --> 00:03:47.620 
interference is to produce those big

00:03:47.620 --> 00:03:50.940 
interference is to produce those big
spikes<00:03:47.920> that<00:03:48.069> you<00:03:48.130> see<00:03:48.310> you<00:03:48.639> can<00:03:49.470> minimize<00:03:50.470> the

00:03:50.940 --> 00:03:50.950 
spikes that you see you can minimize the

00:03:50.950 --> 00:03:53.580 
spikes that you see you can minimize the
effects<00:03:51.370> by<00:03:51.519> actually<00:03:51.850> using<00:03:51.880> curved<00:03:52.630> vanes

00:03:53.580 --> 00:03:53.590 
effects by actually using curved vanes

00:03:53.590 --> 00:03:56.309 
effects by actually using curved vanes
or<00:03:54.040> like<00:03:54.549> the<00:03:54.670> gentle<00:03:55.060> s-shaped<00:03:55.600> ones<00:03:55.900> because

00:03:56.309 --> 00:03:56.319 
or like the gentle s-shaped ones because

00:03:56.319 --> 00:03:57.690 
or like the gentle s-shaped ones because
the<00:03:56.440> light<00:03:56.590> doesn't<00:03:56.829> diffract<00:03:57.250> around<00:03:57.519> them

00:03:57.690 --> 00:03:57.700 
the light doesn't diffract around them

00:03:57.700 --> 00:04:00.599 
the light doesn't diffract around them
quite<00:03:58.000> so<00:03:58.030> clearly<00:03:58.980> so<00:03:59.980> be<00:04:00.100> perfectly<00:04:00.400> honest

00:04:00.599 --> 00:04:00.609 
quite so clearly so be perfectly honest

00:04:00.609 --> 00:04:01.949 
quite so clearly so be perfectly honest
with<00:04:00.670> a<00:04:00.730> telescope<00:04:01.180> like<00:04:01.209> this<00:04:01.600> the

00:04:01.949 --> 00:04:01.959 
with a telescope like this the

00:04:01.959 --> 00:04:03.479 
with a telescope like this the
diffraction<00:04:02.380> spikes<00:04:02.799> don't<00:04:03.069> really<00:04:03.310> cause

00:04:03.479 --> 00:04:03.489 
diffraction spikes don't really cause

00:04:03.489 --> 00:04:04.920 
diffraction spikes don't really cause
that<00:04:03.670> much<00:04:03.880> of<00:04:04.030> a<00:04:04.090> problem<00:04:04.329> with<00:04:04.840> this

00:04:04.920 --> 00:04:04.930 
that much of a problem with this

00:04:04.930 --> 00:04:07.319 
that much of a problem with this
telescope<00:04:05.410> I'm<00:04:05.769> not<00:04:05.920> my<00:04:06.040> last<00:04:06.280> one<00:04:06.639> which<00:04:07.180> had

00:04:07.319 --> 00:04:07.329 
telescope I'm not my last one which had

00:04:07.329 --> 00:04:09.629 
telescope I'm not my last one which had
a<00:04:07.359> similar<00:04:07.780> set<00:04:07.989> up<00:04:08.200> the<00:04:08.889> depression<00:04:09.370> spikes

00:04:09.629 --> 00:04:09.639 
a similar set up the depression spikes

00:04:09.639 --> 00:04:11.970 
a similar set up the depression spikes
are<00:04:09.790> very<00:04:10.060> very<00:04:10.299> delicate<00:04:10.510> and<00:04:11.019> they're<00:04:11.859> very

00:04:11.970 --> 00:04:11.980 
are very very delicate and they're very

00:04:11.980 --> 00:04:14.009 
are very very delicate and they're very
easy<00:04:12.220> to<00:04:12.459> you<00:04:13.030> could<00:04:13.180> process<00:04:13.450> them<00:04:13.720> out<00:04:13.870> of<00:04:13.930> an

00:04:14.009 --> 00:04:14.019 
easy to you could process them out of an

00:04:14.019 --> 00:04:15.599 
easy to you could process them out of an
image<00:04:14.139> if<00:04:14.380> you<00:04:14.410> wish<00:04:14.680> so<00:04:14.950> it's<00:04:15.250> kind<00:04:15.459> of<00:04:15.519> an

00:04:15.599 --> 00:04:15.609 
image if you wish so it's kind of an

00:04:15.609 --> 00:04:17.009 
image if you wish so it's kind of an
important<00:04:16.030> thing<00:04:16.150> if<00:04:16.329> you're<00:04:16.450> designing<00:04:16.630> a

00:04:17.009 --> 00:04:17.019 
important thing if you're designing a

00:04:17.019 --> 00:04:18.900 
important thing if you're designing a
telescope<00:04:17.440> to<00:04:18.039> actually<00:04:18.310> see<00:04:18.489> well<00:04:18.700> what's

00:04:18.900 --> 00:04:18.910 
telescope to actually see well what's

00:04:18.910 --> 00:04:20.370 
telescope to actually see well what's
this<00:04:19.060> going<00:04:19.269> to<00:04:19.359> do<00:04:19.539> to<00:04:19.660> my<00:04:19.750> telescope<00:04:19.989> so<00:04:20.260> at

00:04:20.370 --> 00:04:20.380 
this going to do to my telescope so at

00:04:20.380 --> 00:04:21.360 
this going to do to my telescope so at
the<00:04:20.470> moment<00:04:20.590> for<00:04:20.829> example<00:04:20.859> we're<00:04:21.250> going

00:04:21.360 --> 00:04:21.370 
the moment for example we're going

00:04:21.370 --> 00:04:22.680 
the moment for example we're going
through<00:04:21.549> these<00:04:21.669> design<00:04:22.030> phases<00:04:22.450> with<00:04:22.599> the

00:04:22.680 --> 00:04:22.690 
through these design phases with the

00:04:22.690 --> 00:04:24.149 
through these design phases with the
next<00:04:22.900> generation<00:04:23.349> of<00:04:23.440> the<00:04:23.530> extremely<00:04:24.010> large

00:04:24.149 --> 00:04:24.159 
next generation of the extremely large

00:04:24.159 --> 00:04:25.710 
next generation of the extremely large
telescopes<00:04:24.700> that<00:04:24.970> the<00:04:25.120> European<00:04:25.570> extremely

00:04:25.710 --> 00:04:25.720 
telescopes that the European extremely

00:04:25.720 --> 00:04:27.060 
telescopes that the European extremely
large<00:04:25.960> telescopes<00:04:26.530> the<00:04:26.620> one<00:04:26.710> I'd<00:04:26.830> be<00:04:26.860> most

00:04:27.060 --> 00:04:27.070 
large telescopes the one I'd be most

00:04:27.070 --> 00:04:28.680 
large telescopes the one I'd be most
involved<00:04:27.490> with<00:04:27.610> and<00:04:27.789> one<00:04:28.330> of<00:04:28.360> the<00:04:28.510> things

00:04:28.680 --> 00:04:28.690 
involved with and one of the things

00:04:28.690 --> 00:04:30.210 
involved with and one of the things
people<00:04:28.750> been<00:04:29.080> very<00:04:29.320> worried<00:04:29.680> about<00:04:29.860> is<00:04:30.070> well

00:04:30.210 --> 00:04:30.220 
people been very worried about is well

00:04:30.220 --> 00:04:31.620 
people been very worried about is well
what's<00:04:30.460> the<00:04:30.610> pattern<00:04:30.909> of<00:04:30.970> these<00:04:31.090> diffraction

00:04:31.620 --> 00:04:31.630 
what's the pattern of these diffraction

00:04:31.630 --> 00:04:32.820 
what's the pattern of these diffraction
spikes<00:04:31.870> and<00:04:32.050> other<00:04:32.110> things<00:04:32.409> going<00:04:32.680> to<00:04:32.800> be

00:04:32.820 --> 00:04:32.830 
spikes and other things going to be

00:04:32.830 --> 00:04:34.620 
spikes and other things going to be
because<00:04:33.610> one<00:04:33.909> of<00:04:34.000> the<00:04:34.060> things<00:04:34.210> we<00:04:34.300> want<00:04:34.419> to<00:04:34.479> do

00:04:34.620 --> 00:04:34.630 
because one of the things we want to do

00:04:34.630 --> 00:04:36.510 
because one of the things we want to do
with<00:04:34.780> that<00:04:34.900> telescope<00:04:35.169> is<00:04:35.560> be<00:04:36.010> able<00:04:36.099> to<00:04:36.250> detect

00:04:36.510 --> 00:04:36.520 
with that telescope is be able to detect

00:04:36.520 --> 00:04:38.700 
with that telescope is be able to detect
exoplanets<00:04:37.060> detect<00:04:37.690> in<00:04:37.900> make<00:04:38.110> images<00:04:38.320> of

00:04:38.700 --> 00:04:38.710 
exoplanets detect in make images of

00:04:38.710 --> 00:04:40.050 
exoplanets detect in make images of
planets<00:04:38.979> going<00:04:39.280> around<00:04:39.400> other<00:04:39.610> stars<00:04:39.789> and

00:04:40.050 --> 00:04:40.060 
planets going around other stars and

00:04:40.060 --> 00:04:41.909 
planets going around other stars and
obviously<00:04:40.360> you've<00:04:40.510> got<00:04:40.539> a<00:04:40.630> bright<00:04:40.900> star<00:04:41.260> and<00:04:41.560> a

00:04:41.909 --> 00:04:41.919 
obviously you've got a bright star and a

00:04:41.919 --> 00:04:43.409 
obviously you've got a bright star and a
little<00:04:42.099> planet<00:04:42.400> next<00:04:42.610> to<00:04:42.669> it<00:04:42.820> if<00:04:43.150> we're<00:04:43.330> not

00:04:43.409 --> 00:04:43.419 
little planet next to it if we're not

00:04:43.419 --> 00:04:45.029 
little planet next to it if we're not
careful<00:04:43.599> you<00:04:43.900> could<00:04:44.020> end<00:04:44.169> up<00:04:44.260> wiping<00:04:44.530> out<00:04:44.860> that

00:04:45.029 --> 00:04:45.039 
careful you could end up wiping out that

00:04:45.039 --> 00:04:46.110 
careful you could end up wiping out that
image<00:04:45.280> of<00:04:45.370> the<00:04:45.430> little<00:04:45.490> planet<00:04:45.820> next<00:04:45.970> to<00:04:46.000> it

00:04:46.110 --> 00:04:46.120 
image of the little planet next to it

00:04:46.120 --> 00:04:47.460 
image of the little planet next to it
with<00:04:46.240> a<00:04:46.270> whacking<00:04:46.599> great<00:04:46.630> diffraction<00:04:47.229> spike

00:04:47.460 --> 00:04:47.470 
with a whacking great diffraction spike

00:04:47.470 --> 00:04:49.529 
with a whacking great diffraction spike
so<00:04:47.919> quite<00:04:48.159> a<00:04:48.190> lot<00:04:48.370> of<00:04:48.490> work<00:04:48.640> goes<00:04:48.909> into<00:04:49.330> trying

00:04:49.529 --> 00:04:49.539 
so quite a lot of work goes into trying

00:04:49.539 --> 00:04:51.029 
so quite a lot of work goes into trying
to<00:04:49.630> minimize<00:04:50.200> the<00:04:50.470> impact<00:04:50.830> of<00:04:50.950> these

00:04:51.029 --> 00:04:51.039 
to minimize the impact of these

00:04:51.039 --> 00:04:53.640 
to minimize the impact of these
differential<00:04:51.430> effects<00:04:51.909> it<00:04:52.780> is<00:04:53.020> possible<00:04:53.530> to

00:04:53.640 --> 00:04:53.650 
differential effects it is possible to

00:04:53.650 --> 00:04:55.830 
differential effects it is possible to
actually<00:04:53.770> put<00:04:54.550> diffraction<00:04:55.360> spikes<00:04:55.659> on

00:04:55.830 --> 00:04:55.840 
actually put diffraction spikes on

00:04:55.840 --> 00:04:56.969 
actually put diffraction spikes on
afterwards<00:04:56.229> I<00:04:56.289> mean<00:04:56.409> these<00:04:56.530> two<00:04:56.680> ways<00:04:56.860> of

00:04:56.969 --> 00:04:56.979 
afterwards I mean these two ways of

00:04:56.979 --> 00:04:58.710 
afterwards I mean these two ways of
doing<00:04:57.280> actually<00:04:57.729> if<00:04:57.940> you<00:04:58.180> have<00:04:58.330> a<00:04:58.360> telescope

00:04:58.710 --> 00:04:58.720 
doing actually if you have a telescope

00:04:58.720 --> 00:05:01.260 
doing actually if you have a telescope
that<00:04:58.960> doesn't<00:04:59.289> have<00:04:59.530> these<00:05:00.130> vanes<00:05:00.789> holding<00:05:01.210> a

00:05:01.260 --> 00:05:01.270 
that doesn't have these vanes holding a

00:05:01.270 --> 00:05:03.420 
that doesn't have these vanes holding a
secondary<00:05:01.599> mirror<00:05:01.870> you<00:05:02.409> can<00:05:02.680> put<00:05:03.039> pieces<00:05:03.280> of

00:05:03.420 --> 00:05:03.430 
secondary mirror you can put pieces of

00:05:03.430 --> 00:05:05.399 
secondary mirror you can put pieces of
string<00:05:03.760> across<00:05:04.060> and<00:05:04.840> you<00:05:04.960> get<00:05:05.080> the<00:05:05.200> same

00:05:05.399 --> 00:05:05.409 
string across and you get the same

00:05:05.409 --> 00:05:06.930 
string across and you get the same
effect<00:05:05.650> you're<00:05:06.039> just<00:05:06.220> creating<00:05:06.729> your<00:05:06.849> own

00:05:06.930 --> 00:05:06.940 
effect you're just creating your own

00:05:06.940 --> 00:05:08.010 
effect you're just creating your own
diffraction<00:05:07.479> spikes

00:05:08.010 --> 00:05:08.020

pieces of dowel for example things like
a<00:05:10.270> is<00:05:10.630> possible<00:05:11.200> but<00:05:11.800> there's<00:05:11.919> even<00:05:12.010> software

00:05:12.649 --> 00:05:12.659 
a is possible but there's even software

00:05:12.659 --> 00:05:15.089 
a is possible but there's even software
available<00:05:13.659> now<00:05:14.080> that<00:05:14.229> allows<00:05:14.469> you<00:05:14.620> to<00:05:14.650> do<00:05:14.890> that

00:05:15.089 --> 00:05:15.099 
available now that allows you to do that

00:05:15.099 --> 00:05:16.709 
available now that allows you to do that
it<00:05:15.250> looks<00:05:15.400> at<00:05:15.520> your<00:05:15.640> image<00:05:15.940> and<00:05:16.120> it<00:05:16.270> picks<00:05:16.570> out

00:05:16.709 --> 00:05:16.719 
it looks at your image and it picks out

00:05:16.719 --> 00:05:18.420 
it looks at your image and it picks out
the<00:05:16.870> bright<00:05:17.080> stars<00:05:17.409> and<00:05:17.590> it<00:05:17.650> puts<00:05:17.919> and<00:05:18.190> you<00:05:18.280> can

the bright stars and it puts and you can

00:05:18.430 --> 00:05:20.730 
the bright stars and it puts and you can

rotate the angle of the the spikes you

00:05:20.740 --> 00:05:22.709 
rotate the angle of the the spikes you

00:05:25.920 --> 00:05:25.930 
they're there they're the fact of life

00:05:25.930 --> 00:05:27.540 
they're there they're the fact of life
with<00:05:26.169> this<00:05:26.289> telescope<00:05:26.590> and<00:05:27.070> they're<00:05:27.250> not<00:05:27.400> too

00:05:27.540 --> 00:05:27.550 
with this telescope and they're not too

00:05:27.550 --> 00:05:29.490 
with this telescope and they're not too
much<00:05:27.760> of<00:05:27.880> a<00:05:27.969> problem<00:05:28.180> but<00:05:28.990> I<00:05:29.080> think<00:05:29.260> what<00:05:29.349> other

00:05:29.490 --> 00:05:29.500 
much of a problem but I think what other

00:05:29.500 --> 00:05:31.560 
much of a problem but I think what other
people<00:05:29.770> do<00:05:29.860> it<00:05:30.010> what<00:05:30.400> well<00:05:30.820> if<00:05:31.060> you'd<00:05:31.210> imagined

00:05:31.560 --> 00:05:31.570 
people do it what well if you'd imagined

00:05:31.570 --> 00:05:33.630 
people do it what well if you'd imagined
objects<00:05:31.960> like<00:05:32.140> the<00:05:32.380> the<00:05:32.680> Pleiades<00:05:33.370> star

00:05:33.630 --> 00:05:33.640 
objects like the the Pleiades star

00:05:33.640 --> 00:05:36.810 
objects like the the Pleiades star
cluster<00:05:34.120> they<00:05:34.960> do<00:05:35.469> look<00:05:35.770> quite<00:05:35.860> quite<00:05:36.490> attract

00:05:36.810 --> 00:05:36.820 
cluster they do look quite quite attract

00:05:36.820 --> 00:05:39.180 
cluster they do look quite quite attract
only<00:05:37.150> these<00:05:37.300> multiple<00:05:37.780> stars<00:05:38.050> with<00:05:38.289> them<00:05:38.560> with

00:05:39.180 --> 00:05:39.190 
only these multiple stars with them with

00:05:39.190 --> 00:05:41.459 
only these multiple stars with them with
you<00:05:39.880> know<00:05:39.969> these<00:05:40.120> conic<00:05:40.719> diffraction<00:05:41.140> spikes

00:05:41.459 --> 00:05:41.469 
you know these conic diffraction spikes

00:05:41.469 --> 00:05:43.380 
you know these conic diffraction spikes
on<00:05:41.710> it<00:05:42.159> certainly<00:05:42.520> makes<00:05:42.760> astronomical

00:05:43.380 --> 00:05:43.390 
on it certainly makes astronomical

00:05:43.390 --> 00:05:44.700 
on it certainly makes astronomical
images<00:05:43.659> look<00:05:43.810> prettier<00:05:44.140> there's<00:05:44.289> no<00:05:44.380> denying

00:05:44.700 --> 00:05:44.710 
images look prettier there's no denying

00:05:44.710 --> 00:05:46.770 
images look prettier there's no denying
it<00:05:44.860> as<00:05:45.010> nice<00:05:45.490> bright<00:05:45.789> stars<00:05:46.120> but<00:05:46.360> nice<00:05:46.479> little

00:05:46.770 --> 00:05:46.780 
it as nice bright stars but nice little

00:05:46.780 --> 00:05:48.089 
it as nice bright stars but nice little
differential<00:05:47.050> spikes<00:05:47.409> look<00:05:47.620> very<00:05:47.830> pretty

00:05:48.089 --> 00:05:48.099 
differential spikes look very pretty

00:05:48.099 --> 00:05:50.190 
differential spikes look very pretty
indeed<00:05:48.310> I've<00:05:48.849> got<00:05:49.210> mixed<00:05:49.360> opinions<00:05:49.900> on<00:05:50.020> and<00:05:50.140> we

00:05:50.190 --> 00:05:50.200 
indeed I've got mixed opinions on and we

00:05:50.200 --> 00:05:52.260 
indeed I've got mixed opinions on and we
fit<00:05:50.409> there<00:05:50.710> if<00:05:50.950> the<00:05:51.370> telescope<00:05:51.760> creates<00:05:52.090> them

00:05:52.260 --> 00:05:52.270 
fit there if the telescope creates them

00:05:52.270 --> 00:05:53.370 
fit there if the telescope creates them
up<00:05:52.390> don't<00:05:52.510> have<00:05:52.690> a<00:05:52.750> problem<00:05:53.080> with<00:05:53.200> that<00:05:53.229> I

00:05:53.370 --> 00:05:53.380 
up don't have a problem with that I

00:05:53.380 --> 00:05:55.140 
up don't have a problem with that I
don't<00:05:53.590> think<00:05:53.740> I've<00:05:53.860> really<00:05:54.099> got<00:05:54.760> my<00:05:54.940> way<00:05:55.090> to

00:05:55.140 --> 00:05:55.150 
don't think I've really got my way to

00:05:55.150 --> 00:05:57.810 
don't think I've really got my way to
put<00:05:55.840> them<00:05:55.930> on<00:05:56.080> artificially<00:05:56.890> but<00:05:57.490> yeah<00:05:57.669> when

00:05:57.810 --> 00:05:57.820 
put them on artificially but yeah when

00:05:57.820 --> 00:05:58.950 
put them on artificially but yeah when
you<00:05:57.880> come<00:05:58.030> to<00:05:58.150> do<00:05:58.240> the<00:05:58.330> science<00:05:58.659> they<00:05:58.810> are<00:05:58.840> a

00:05:58.950 --> 00:05:58.960 
you come to do the science they are a

00:05:58.960 --> 00:06:01.740 
you come to do the science they are a
pain<00:05:59.460> how<00:06:00.460> do<00:06:00.520> you<00:06:00.729> get<00:06:00.880> around<00:06:01.000> that<00:06:01.330> pain<00:06:01.570> is

00:06:01.740 --> 00:06:01.750 
pain how do you get around that pain is

00:06:01.750 --> 00:06:04.050 
pain how do you get around that pain is
that<00:06:01.930> like<00:06:02.080> is<00:06:02.469> there<00:06:03.010> like<00:06:03.219> a<00:06:03.250> way<00:06:03.550> to<00:06:03.580> correct

00:06:04.050 --> 00:06:04.060 
that like is there like a way to correct

00:06:04.060 --> 00:06:05.399 
that like is there like a way to correct
for<00:06:04.360> them<00:06:04.510> or<00:06:04.719> not

00:06:05.399 --> 00:06:05.409 
for them or not

00:06:05.409 --> 00:06:07.110 
for them or not
really<00:06:05.950> so<00:06:06.280> I<00:06:06.310> mean<00:06:06.580> well<00:06:06.700> you<00:06:06.820> know<00:06:06.849> one<00:06:07.030> of

00:06:07.110 --> 00:06:07.120 
really so I mean well you know one of

00:06:07.120 --> 00:06:08.279 
really so I mean well you know one of
the<00:06:07.210> things<00:06:07.330> you<00:06:07.419> can<00:06:07.510> always<00:06:07.690> do<00:06:07.990> with<00:06:08.200> your

00:06:08.279 --> 00:06:08.289 
the things you can always do with your

00:06:08.289 --> 00:06:09.779 
the things you can always do with your
telescope<00:06:08.530> supposing<00:06:09.219> for<00:06:09.250> example<00:06:09.370> you've

00:06:09.779 --> 00:06:09.789 
telescope supposing for example you've

00:06:09.789 --> 00:06:10.920 
telescope supposing for example you've
got<00:06:09.909> you<00:06:10.030> know<00:06:10.150> you've<00:06:10.270> got<00:06:10.360> a<00:06:10.390> bright<00:06:10.630> star

00:06:10.920 --> 00:06:10.930 
got you know you've got a bright star

00:06:10.930 --> 00:06:12.149 
got you know you've got a bright star
next<00:06:11.140> to<00:06:11.200> the<00:06:11.289> object<00:06:11.380> you're<00:06:11.590> interested<00:06:12.010> in

00:06:12.149 --> 00:06:12.159 
next to the object you're interested in

00:06:12.159 --> 00:06:14.010 
next to the object you're interested in
and<00:06:12.340> the<00:06:12.820> diffraction<00:06:13.090> spike<00:06:13.390> is<00:06:13.510> wiping<00:06:13.930> out

00:06:14.010 --> 00:06:14.020 
and the diffraction spike is wiping out

00:06:14.020 --> 00:06:15.480 
and the diffraction spike is wiping out
the<00:06:14.140> object<00:06:14.409> you're<00:06:14.530> interested<00:06:14.890> in<00:06:15.010> because

00:06:15.480 --> 00:06:15.490 
the object you're interested in because

00:06:15.490 --> 00:06:16.469 
the object you're interested in because
one<00:06:15.640> of<00:06:15.669> the<00:06:15.789> things<00:06:15.969> you<00:06:16.060> can<00:06:16.180> do<00:06:16.270> is<00:06:16.390> just

00:06:16.469 --> 00:06:16.479 
one of the things you can do is just

00:06:16.479 --> 00:06:17.730 
one of the things you can do is just
rotate<00:06:16.870> the<00:06:16.960> telescope<00:06:17.289> a<00:06:17.380> bit<00:06:17.560> and<00:06:17.680> that's

00:06:17.730 --> 00:06:17.740 
rotate the telescope a bit and that's

00:06:17.740 --> 00:06:18.959 
rotate the telescope a bit and that's
going<00:06:18.010> to<00:06:18.070> move<00:06:18.159> the<00:06:18.340> diffraction<00:06:18.610> spikes

00:06:18.959 --> 00:06:18.969 
going to move the diffraction spikes

00:06:18.969 --> 00:06:20.310 
going to move the diffraction spikes
around<00:06:19.090> so<00:06:19.419> you<00:06:19.510> can<00:06:19.659> get<00:06:19.780> them<00:06:19.900> out<00:06:19.990> the<00:06:20.200> way

00:06:20.310 --> 00:06:20.320 
around so you can get them out the way

00:06:20.320 --> 00:06:21.990 
around so you can get them out the way
that<00:06:20.560> way<00:06:20.710> so<00:06:21.099> those<00:06:21.219> things<00:06:21.430> you<00:06:21.550> can<00:06:21.700> do<00:06:21.849> to

00:06:21.990 --> 00:06:22.000 
that way so those things you can do to

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:24.000 
that way so those things you can do to
mitigate<00:06:22.180> the<00:06:22.539> effects<00:06:22.870> of<00:06:22.930> them<00:06:23.140> but

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:24.010 
mitigate the effects of them but

00:06:24.010 --> 00:06:24.959 
mitigate the effects of them but
generally<00:06:24.340> you<00:06:24.430> just<00:06:24.460> have<00:06:24.640> to<00:06:24.729> live<00:06:24.880> with

00:06:24.959 --> 00:06:24.969 
generally you just have to live with

00:06:24.969 --> 00:06:26.459 
generally you just have to live with
them<00:06:25.060> that's<00:06:25.570> something<00:06:25.690> you<00:06:26.020> do<00:06:26.169> though<00:06:26.320> is

00:06:26.459 --> 00:06:26.469 
them that's something you do though is

00:06:26.469 --> 00:06:28.200 
them that's something you do though is
it<00:06:26.620> like<00:06:26.740> yeah<00:06:26.890> you<00:06:27.190> can<00:06:27.310> arrange<00:06:27.610> for<00:06:27.820> the

00:06:28.200 --> 00:06:28.210 
it like yeah you can arrange for the

00:06:28.210 --> 00:06:29.760 
it like yeah you can arrange for the
diffraction<00:06:28.450> to<00:06:28.719> be<00:06:28.840> spikes<00:06:29.349> to<00:06:29.469> be<00:06:29.530> in<00:06:29.620> such<00:06:29.740> a

00:06:29.760 --> 00:06:29.770 
diffraction to be spikes to be in such a

00:06:29.770 --> 00:06:31.230 
diffraction to be spikes to be in such a
way<00:06:29.949> that<00:06:30.100> they<00:06:30.160> don't<00:06:30.340> wash<00:06:30.520> Li<00:06:30.699> wipe<00:06:30.880> out<00:06:31.090> the

00:06:31.230 --> 00:06:31.240 
way that they don't wash Li wipe out the

00:06:31.240 --> 00:06:32.340 
way that they don't wash Li wipe out the
things<00:06:31.419> that<00:06:31.569> you're<00:06:31.660> most<00:06:31.810> interested<00:06:31.930> in

00:06:32.340 --> 00:06:32.350 
things that you're most interested in

00:06:32.350 --> 00:06:33.689 
things that you're most interested in
doing<00:06:32.620> and<00:06:32.860> it's<00:06:33.130> that<00:06:33.280> part<00:06:33.490> of<00:06:33.610> the

00:06:33.689 --> 00:06:33.699 
doing and it's that part of the

00:06:33.699 --> 00:06:35.340 
doing and it's that part of the
pre-planning<00:06:34.300> process<00:06:34.720> or<00:06:34.870> you<00:06:34.960> do<00:06:35.080> it<00:06:35.169> on<00:06:35.259> the

00:06:35.340 --> 00:06:35.350 
pre-planning process or you do it on the

00:06:35.350 --> 00:06:37.320 
pre-planning process or you do it on the
floor<00:06:35.560> hey<00:06:35.800> it<00:06:36.610> should<00:06:36.850> be<00:06:37.000> part<00:06:37.150> of<00:06:37.240> the

00:06:37.320 --> 00:06:37.330 
floor hey it should be part of the

00:06:37.330 --> 00:06:38.909 
floor hey it should be part of the
pre-planning<00:06:37.810> process<00:06:37.930> sometimes<00:06:38.560> it's<00:06:38.800> only

00:06:38.909 --> 00:06:38.919 
pre-planning process sometimes it's only

00:06:38.919 --> 00:06:39.629 
pre-planning process sometimes it's only
when<00:06:39.100> you<00:06:39.190> take<00:06:39.340> the

00:06:39.629 --> 00:06:39.639 
when you take the

00:06:39.639 --> 00:06:41.159 
when you take the
oh<00:06:39.699> they<00:06:39.909> all<00:06:40.030> know<00:06:40.330> and<00:06:40.659> then<00:06:40.749> you<00:06:40.870> have<00:06:40.990> to<00:06:41.080> go

00:06:41.159 --> 00:06:41.169 
oh they all know and then you have to go

00:06:41.169 --> 00:06:42.480 
oh they all know and then you have to go
back<00:06:41.379> and<00:06:41.560> think<00:06:41.770> well<00:06:41.889> actually<00:06:42.009> that's<00:06:42.249> tie

00:06:42.480 --> 00:06:42.490 
back and think well actually that's tie

00:06:42.490 --> 00:06:43.890 
back and think well actually that's tie
the<00:06:42.550> whole<00:06:43.180> thing<00:06:43.389> in<00:06:43.509> a<00:06:43.569> slightly<00:06:43.810> different

00:06:43.890 --> 00:06:43.900 
the whole thing in a slightly different

00:06:43.900 --> 00:06:46.230 
the whole thing in a slightly different
orientation<00:06:44.710> if<00:06:45.490> you're<00:06:45.729> using<00:06:45.879> for<00:06:46.150> example

00:06:46.230 --> 00:06:46.240 
orientation if you're using for example

00:06:46.240 --> 00:06:49.230 
orientation if you're using for example
a<00:06:46.539> Schmidt<00:06:46.870> Cassegrain<00:06:47.139> telescope<00:06:47.939> that<00:06:48.939> has

00:06:49.230 --> 00:06:49.240 
a Schmidt Cassegrain telescope that has

00:06:49.240 --> 00:06:51.779 
a Schmidt Cassegrain telescope that has
an<00:06:49.900> optical<00:06:50.289> window<00:06:50.919> especially<00:06:51.370> shaped

00:06:51.779 --> 00:06:51.789 
an optical window especially shaped

00:06:51.789 --> 00:06:53.610 
an optical window especially shaped
piece<00:06:51.999> of<00:06:52.150> lens<00:06:52.599> if<00:06:52.840> you<00:06:52.930> like<00:06:53.110> at<00:06:53.289> the<00:06:53.379> front

00:06:53.610 --> 00:06:53.620 
piece of lens if you like at the front

00:06:53.620 --> 00:06:55.860 
piece of lens if you like at the front
end<00:06:53.860> the<00:06:54.729> secondary<00:06:55.150> mirrors<00:06:55.419> actually<00:06:55.509> held

00:06:55.860 --> 00:06:55.870 
end the secondary mirrors actually held

00:06:55.870 --> 00:06:57.629 
end the secondary mirrors actually held
in<00:06:55.990> the<00:06:56.080> middle<00:06:56.349> of<00:06:56.439> that<00:06:56.650> so<00:06:57.159> with<00:06:57.310> a<00:06:57.340> Schmidt

00:06:57.629 --> 00:06:57.639 
in the middle of that so with a Schmidt

00:06:57.639 --> 00:06:58.950 
in the middle of that so with a Schmidt
Cassegrain<00:06:57.819> telescope<00:06:58.090> don't<00:06:58.629> actually<00:06:58.719> get

00:06:58.950 --> 00:06:58.960 
Cassegrain telescope don't actually get

00:06:58.960 --> 00:07:00.749 
Cassegrain telescope don't actually get
any<00:06:59.020> diffraction<00:06:59.650> spikes<00:07:00.009> the<00:07:00.490> other<00:07:00.610> thing

00:07:00.749 --> 00:07:00.759 
any diffraction spikes the other thing

00:07:00.759 --> 00:07:01.860 
any diffraction spikes the other thing
is<00:07:00.849> actually<00:07:00.969> so<00:07:01.330> if<00:07:01.419> you<00:07:01.509> have<00:07:01.599> a<00:07:01.659> very

00:07:01.860 --> 00:07:01.870 
is actually so if you have a very

00:07:01.870 --> 00:07:03.570 
is actually so if you have a very
old-style<00:07:02.259> refracting<00:07:02.860> telescope<00:07:03.249> so<00:07:03.370> one<00:07:03.490> of

00:07:03.570 --> 00:07:03.580 
old-style refracting telescope so one of

00:07:03.580 --> 00:07:05.519 
old-style refracting telescope so one of
the<00:07:03.639> ones<00:07:03.849> with<00:07:03.939> lenses<00:07:04.330> cause<00:07:04.960> the<00:07:05.289> way<00:07:05.379> they

00:07:05.519 --> 00:07:05.529 
the ones with lenses cause the way they

00:07:05.529 --> 00:07:06.510 
the ones with lenses cause the way they
work<00:07:05.770> the<00:07:05.919> light<00:07:06.069> just<00:07:06.279> goes<00:07:06.400> straight

00:07:06.510 --> 00:07:06.520 
work the light just goes straight

00:07:06.520 --> 00:07:07.739 
work the light just goes straight
through<00:07:06.789> from<00:07:06.849> one<00:07:07.029> end<00:07:07.180> to<00:07:07.240> the<00:07:07.330> other<00:07:07.389> so<00:07:07.569> you

00:07:07.739 --> 00:07:07.749 
through from one end to the other so you

00:07:07.749 --> 00:07:08.850 
through from one end to the other so you
don't<00:07:07.930> have<00:07:08.080> this<00:07:08.199> issue<00:07:08.409> of<00:07:08.560> having<00:07:08.650> to

00:07:08.850 --> 00:07:08.860 
don't have this issue of having to

00:07:08.860 --> 00:07:10.679 
don't have this issue of having to
support<00:07:09.009> the<00:07:09.249> secondary<00:07:09.580> so<00:07:09.909> actually<00:07:10.120> if<00:07:10.389> you

00:07:10.679 --> 00:07:10.689 
support the secondary so actually if you

00:07:10.689 --> 00:07:11.790 
support the secondary so actually if you
take<00:07:10.840> a<00:07:10.900> picture<00:07:11.110> with<00:07:11.259> a<00:07:11.379> refracting

00:07:11.790 --> 00:07:11.800 
take a picture with a refracting

00:07:11.800 --> 00:07:12.929 
take a picture with a refracting
telescope<00:07:12.129> you<00:07:12.219> don't<00:07:12.400> get<00:07:12.520> diffraction

00:07:12.929 --> 00:07:12.939 
telescope you don't get diffraction

00:07:12.939 --> 00:07:15.389 
telescope you don't get diffraction
spikes<00:07:13.180> tool
