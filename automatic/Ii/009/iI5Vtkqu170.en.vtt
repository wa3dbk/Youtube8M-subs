team<00:01:31.890> you<00:01:31.950> know<00:01:32.250> somebody<00:01:32.610> like<00:01:32.790> mitch<00:01:33.030> is<00:01:33.299> a

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:33.540 
team you know somebody like mitch is a

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:34.910 
team you know somebody like mitch is a
once-in-a-lifetime<00:01:33.960> thing<00:01:34.350> and<00:01:34.799> that's

00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:34.920 
once-in-a-lifetime thing and that's

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:36.980 
once-in-a-lifetime thing and that's
something<00:01:35.280> that<00:01:35.369> I've<00:01:36.360> always<00:01:36.570> dreamed

00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:36.990 
something that I've always dreamed

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:38.690 
something that I've always dreamed
arriving<00:01:37.439> floor<00:01:37.710> and<00:01:37.829> I'm<00:01:37.920> glad<00:01:38.009> I<00:01:38.130> guess<00:01:38.520> it

00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:38.700 
arriving floor and I'm glad I guess it

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:40.219 
arriving floor and I'm glad I guess it
didn't<00:01:38.909> come<00:01:39.060> any<00:01:39.210> earlier<00:01:39.299> because<00:01:39.810> I<00:01:40.170> think

00:01:40.219 --> 00:01:40.229 
didn't come any earlier because I think

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:43.160 
didn't come any earlier because I think
maybe<00:01:40.740> I<00:01:40.920> wasn't<00:01:41.280> ready<00:01:41.549> for<00:01:41.640> it<00:01:41.960> so<00:01:42.960> I<00:01:42.990> think

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:43.170 
maybe I wasn't ready for it so I think

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:44.780 
maybe I wasn't ready for it so I think
now<00:01:43.560> I'm<00:01:43.770> kind<00:01:43.950> of<00:01:44.100> getting<00:01:44.220> all<00:01:44.490> the<00:01:44.610> pieces

that's been pretty close i mean i got to

00:02:32.490 --> 00:02:34.040 
that's been pretty close i mean i got to
go<00:02:32.550> back<00:02:32.730> to<00:02:32.940> Langston<00:02:33.420> and<00:02:33.570> read<00:02:33.780> when<00:02:33.960> they

go back to Langston and read when they
had<00:02:34.230> the<00:02:34.350> problems<00:02:34.710> a<00:02:34.770> few<00:02:34.950> years<00:02:35.070> ago

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:35.190 
had the problems a few years ago

00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:36.890 
had the problems a few years ago
Langston<00:02:35.670> gets<00:02:35.820> a<00:02:35.910> hundred<00:02:36.150> thousand<00:02:36.540> that

00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:36.900 
Langston gets a hundred thousand that

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:38.420 
Langston gets a hundred thousand that
was<00:02:37.020> only<00:02:37.140> a<00:02:37.230> couple<00:02:37.470> points<00:02:37.740> so<00:02:37.920> those<00:02:38.070> points

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:38.430 
was only a couple points so those points

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:40.040 
was only a couple points so those points
are<00:02:38.520> very<00:02:38.670> valuable<00:02:38.910> yeah<00:02:39.480> i<00:02:39.510> agree<00:02:39.720> i<00:02:39.900> think

00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:40.050 
are very valuable yeah i agree i think

00:02:40.050 --> 00:02:41.690 
are very valuable yeah i agree i think
every<00:02:40.410> point<00:02:40.590> definitely<00:02:40.980> counts<00:02:41.340> trusting

00:02:41.690 --> 00:02:41.700 
every point definitely counts trusting

00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:43.100 
every point definitely counts trusting
