00:00:06.379 --> 00:00:11.730
 What would have been if 

00:00:08.670 --> 00:00:14.700
 if the referee harnessed the foul 

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:17.520
 to lucca staiger would have whistled if 

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:20.359
 The due free-fall would have fallen 

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:20.359
 too much subjunctive 

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:32.740
 what stands still is not 

00:00:30.100 --> 00:00:34.660
 undeserved 89 to 84 success 

00:00:32.740 --> 00:00:36.850
 French against a young German 

00:00:34.660 --> 00:00:38.520
 national team against the 

00:00:36.850 --> 00:00:42.420
 favorites beaten more than honorable 

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:42.420
 and has sold dearly 

00:00:53.170 --> 00:00:57.289
 the team of national coach frank menz 

00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:59.989
 had focused and determined 

00:00:57.289 --> 00:01:01.550
 he started the respect and the 

00:00:59.989 --> 00:01:05.379
 shy of the prominently occupied 

00:01:01.550 --> 00:01:05.379
 French can quickly drop 

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:17.550
 despite the injury-related failures 

00:01:15.480 --> 00:01:20.130
 by tibor pleiÃŸ and robin benzing 

00:01:17.550 --> 00:01:22.490
 the team started one early 

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:22.490
 guide 

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:30.500
 The German team played deliberately met 

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:34.180
 a good throw selection and always found 

00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:34.180
 again the better positioned man 

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:44.720
 in the second quarter, this was done 

00:01:42.229 --> 00:01:47.810
 dbb team then a phase of weakness the 

00:01:44.720 --> 00:01:49.549
 Equipe Tricolore knew how to use everyone 

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:52.070
 ahead of the strong playing nicola

 button in nba for portland 

00:01:52.070 --> 00:01:55.520
 basket hunt goes put the German 

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:58.000
 team again and again before insoluble 

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:58.000
 tasks 

00:02:03.790 --> 00:02:07.730
 until the third quarter 

00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:10.429
 France a convincing performance 

00:02:07.730 --> 00:02:12.789
 and worked out a chance 

00:02:10.429 --> 00:02:12.789
 the other 

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:28.150
 the backlog was in the meantime 

00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:32.980
 more than 20 points in Germany 

00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:34.599
 finally switch could turn so 

00:02:32.980 --> 00:02:36.459
 by the national coach frank menz with 

00:02:34.599 --> 00:02:38.260
 given as he partially with over 20 

00:02:36.459 --> 00:02:40.209
 back back complains what already 

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:41.560
 said that we play constantly 

00:02:40.209 --> 00:02:46.080
 should keep our focus 

00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:48.819
 should and it sounds very much 

00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:50.920
 Coach just say I but it 

00:02:48.819 --> 00:02:54.040
 just right that you stay constant 

00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:55.750
 did not have to scobel at the score 

00:02:54.040 --> 00:02:58.480
 but must be based just on the 

00:02:55.750 --> 00:03:04.540
 students and continued in the game remained the 

00:02:58.480 --> 00:03:06.160
 guys put down a 16 to zero 

00:03:04.540 --> 00:03:06.610
 protections of frank menz on the 

00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:09.430
 parquet 

00:03:06.610 --> 00:03:12.840
 thanks to strong defensive worked 

00:03:09.430 --> 00:03:12.840
 the team gets closer to the point 

00:03:27.610 --> 00:03:31.660
 baskets like here by karsten tadda 

00:03:29.470 --> 00:03:32.200
 also know the audience from their 

00:03:31.660 --> 00:03:34.510
 sit 

00:03:32.200 --> 00:03:36.730
 in the fourth quarter final 

00:03:34.510 --> 00:03:40.320
 sixth man had become and the team 

00:03:36.730 --> 00:03:40.320
 actively supported 

00:03:51.440 --> 00:03:53.680
 July 

00:03:54.640 --> 00:03:59.900
 and then came the appearance of Lucca 

00:03:57.320 --> 00:04:03.440
 staiger who deserves the free throws 

00:03:59.900 --> 00:04:05.690
 updated so the game went though 

00:04:03.440 --> 00:04:07.250
 but lost the German basketball 

00:04:05.690 --> 00:04:10.010
 national team had expensive 

00:04:07.250 --> 00:04:13.510
 sells and gets her lessons from the 

00:04:10.010 --> 00:04:15.920
 to take a lot with you 

00:04:13.510 --> 00:04:18.200
 now three weeks are training a lot 

00:04:15.920 --> 00:04:19.720
 We have made a lot of plans for 

00:04:18.200 --> 00:04:22.790
 regardless of the outcome 

00:04:19.720 --> 00:04:24.500
 and we knew that the French despite 

00:04:22.790 --> 00:04:26.630
 are in europe for the gold medal 

00:04:24.500 --> 00:04:28.310
 play with being riddled with really 

00:04:26.630 --> 00:04:32.330
 stars you in the euroleague 

00:04:28.310 --> 00:04:34.400
 top players are those students we are 

00:04:32.330 --> 00:04:36.200
 have no goal set us what the 

00:04:34.400 --> 00:04:38.630
 Points have touched us to the goal 

00:04:36.200 --> 00:04:40.790
 set that we are as good as it gets 

00:04:38.630 --> 00:04:43.400
 playing 40 minutes no matter what 

00:04:40.790 --> 00:04:45.710
 score always have the head up us 

00:04:43.400 --> 00:04:47.810
 our things play and discipline 

00:04:45.710 --> 00:04:49.610
 stay and I was also very 

00:04:47.810 --> 00:04:50.870
 relieved the second time that has 

00:04:49.610 --> 00:04:52.640
 has paid off nevertheless to the 

00:04:50.870 --> 00:04:53.570
 score still in the first quarter was 

00:04:52.640 --> 00:04:56.450
 I played very well 

00:04:53.570 --> 00:04:58.940
 in the second quarter they were extreme 

00:04:56.450 --> 00:05:01.190
 strong and that we still mine 

00:04:58.940 --> 00:05:02.660
 second single then zooms the later one 

00:05:01.190 --> 00:05:04.930
 have believed that helps us for 

00:05:02.660 --> 00:05:04.930
 the future 

00:05:06.070 --> 00:05:10.140
 at the end the team celebrated together with 

00:05:08.350 --> 00:05:15.150
 a great performance for the fans in mannheim 

00:05:10.140 --> 00:05:15.150
