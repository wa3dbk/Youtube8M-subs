00:00:05.320 --> 00:00:11.320
 hello to youtube as they are in this video 

00:00:08.650 --> 00:00:14.469
 I'm going to show you how to increase the 

00:00:11.320 --> 00:00:16.890
 volume of your voice in sony vegas this what 

00:00:14.469 --> 00:00:20.400
 I do because I know a lot of people 

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:23.529
 including me why that microphone walks 

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:26.670
 I mean not that it goes wrong but that it is heard 

00:00:23.529 --> 00:00:29.710
 a little down or have some problems 

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:33.580
 possibly it is heard clean and without 

00:00:29.710 --> 00:00:37.450
 background noise but heard low and not 

00:00:33.580 --> 00:00:39.700
 we have some option to upload 

00:00:37.450 --> 00:00:43.149
 the volume or something like that before 

00:00:39.700 --> 00:00:44.640
 to start let's go to the start panel 

00:00:43.149 --> 00:00:49.680
 of control 

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:53.280
 sound let's go to record let's go to the 

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:56.430
 microphone we go to properties levels and 

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:59.670
 let's make sure that the microphone 

00:00:56.430 --> 00:01:01.920
 be 100% volume and amplification of 

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:05.540
 microphone will be in 0 surely and 

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:07.490
 let's go up to 10 10 decibels 

00:01:05.540 --> 00:01:09.410
 with this we are going to increase in certain 

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:11.860
 form the volume but possibly not 

00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:13.820
 reach for what we need 

00:01:11.860 --> 00:01:15.830
 such as uploading a video to 

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:18.260
 youtube or talk on skype among others 

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:21.880
 things so good let's open 

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:24.760
 our video wherever we have 

00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:27.940
 Sound 

00:01:24.760 --> 00:01:31.710
 the voice has increased the sound 

00:01:27.940 --> 00:01:31.710
 and I only have to see here 

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:37.469
 we drag it to the hard timeline 

00:01:35.399 --> 00:01:39.950
 very little time 

00:01:37.469 --> 00:01:43.000
 it has been purpose 

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:46.390
 I hope in a moment that I'm going to 

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:49.380
 I do the aspect ratio 

00:01:46.390 --> 00:01:49.380
 and I put it 

00:01:55.510 --> 00:01:59.840
 good 

00:01:56.909 --> 00:01:59.840
 they listen 

00:02:08.380 --> 00:02:13.840
 well there they could hear the sound 

00:02:11.320 --> 00:02:18.540
 now let's see the difference in 

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:21.560
 when I raise the decibels and increase 

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:24.640
 the output fade control so 

00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:27.600
 I'm going to play 

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:27.600
 increase 

00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:31.270
 better the steps and I increase it and then 

00:02:29.890 --> 00:02:35.260
 I reproduce it 

00:02:31.270 --> 00:02:39.160
 then in volume always in the part 

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:42.840
 of sound because obvious in the video is not going 

00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:45.840
 so let's look like then 

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:49.050
 on the sound track in decibels what 

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:50.760
 we increase to 12 that is the maximum and 

00:02:49.050 --> 00:02:55.280
 fade control output we're going to 

00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:55.280
 upload to the maximum also and now listen 

00:03:03.569 --> 00:03:08.819
 we noticed a gigantic difference in 

00:03:06.870 --> 00:03:12.389
 as to what is the sound and not 

00:03:08.819 --> 00:03:16.499
 loses or if the sound is still 

00:03:12.389 --> 00:03:18.480
 clean we increase the decibels there is no 

00:03:16.499 --> 00:03:19.829
 difference with the alter with the before and 

00:03:18.480 --> 00:03:22.709
 the later only that is heard more 

00:03:19.829 --> 00:03:27.650
 strong or this is a very method but 

00:03:22.709 --> 00:03:29.819
 very very very efficient and serves 

00:03:27.650 --> 00:03:33.510
 enormously be 

00:03:29.819 --> 00:03:36.230
 if you listen to them below and what 

00:03:33.510 --> 00:03:40.790
 they want to directly go up this is the 

00:03:36.230 --> 00:03:44.959
 method the best method to use 

00:03:40.790 --> 00:03:47.629
 so until here we arrived I know that this 

00:03:44.959 --> 00:03:50.689
 video lasts little because it was a method 

00:03:47.629 --> 00:03:52.370
 easy but good there are many people who 

00:03:50.689 --> 00:03:55.129
 I needed so I do it only 

00:03:52.370 --> 00:03:57.829
 that's why I hope you liked it if you 

00:03:55.129 --> 00:03:59.740
 liked the hummer manito up or 

00:03:57.829 --> 00:04:01.420
 subscribe 

00:03:59.740 --> 00:04:04.530
 enter my twitter that I'm going to 

00:04:01.420 --> 00:04:04.530
 leave now in the video 

00:04:04.630 --> 00:04:09.600
