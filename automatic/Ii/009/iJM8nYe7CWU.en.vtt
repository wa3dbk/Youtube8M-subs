00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:01.939 

so<00:00:00.269> here's<00:00:00.450> a<00:00:00.539> question<00:00:00.719> what<00:00:01.650> was<00:00:01.829> the

00:00:01.939 --> 00:00:01.949 
so here's a question what was the

00:00:01.949 --> 00:00:04.490 
so here's a question what was the
Megalodon<00:00:02.310> shark<00:00:02.870> well<00:00:03.870> in<00:00:03.990> this<00:00:04.080> video<00:00:04.380> we're

00:00:04.490 --> 00:00:04.500 
Megalodon shark well in this video we're

00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:05.780 
Megalodon shark well in this video we're
going<00:00:04.589> to<00:00:04.650> find<00:00:04.920> out<00:00:05.130> and<00:00:05.310> what<00:00:05.670> we're

00:00:05.780 --> 00:00:05.790 
going to find out and what we're

00:00:05.790 --> 00:00:06.710 
going to find out and what we're
actually<00:00:05.879> going<00:00:06.120> to<00:00:06.210> learn<00:00:06.299> here<00:00:06.569> is<00:00:06.690> that

00:00:06.710 --> 00:00:06.720 
actually going to learn here is that

00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:13.140 
actually going to learn here is that
it's<00:00:06.960> a<00:00:07.020> lot<00:00:07.170> simpler<00:00:07.500> than<00:00:07.589> it<00:00:07.799> seems

00:00:13.140 --> 00:00:13.150 

00:00:13.150 --> 00:00:15.789 

and<00:00:14.150> so<00:00:14.269> the<00:00:14.360> MacLennan<00:00:14.660> shark<00:00:15.049> is<00:00:15.200> a<00:00:15.230> topic<00:00:15.679> I

00:00:15.789 --> 00:00:15.799 
and so the MacLennan shark is a topic I

00:00:15.799 --> 00:00:17.679 
and so the MacLennan shark is a topic I
have<00:00:15.830> been<00:00:16.189> very<00:00:16.609> interested<00:00:17.180> in<00:00:17.300> explaining

00:00:17.679 --> 00:00:17.689 
have been very interested in explaining

00:00:17.689 --> 00:00:19.210 
have been very interested in explaining
since<00:00:18.080> I<00:00:18.170> consider<00:00:18.529> it<00:00:18.650> to<00:00:18.740> be<00:00:18.770> one<00:00:19.070> of<00:00:19.160> the

00:00:19.210 --> 00:00:19.220 
since I consider it to be one of the

00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:21.310 
since I consider it to be one of the
most<00:00:19.400> fascinating<00:00:19.670> creatures<00:00:20.449> to<00:00:20.960> have<00:00:21.079> ever
