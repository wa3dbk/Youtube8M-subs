resolution<00:00:14.790> I<00:00:14.910> have<00:00:15.030> put<00:00:15.240> down<00:00:15.269> so<00:00:15.750> that<00:00:15.960> I

00:00:16.220 --> 00:00:16.230 
resolution I have put down so that I

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:18.830 
resolution I have put down so that I
don't<00:00:16.859> get<00:00:17.010> any<00:00:17.220> lag<00:00:17.550> at<00:00:17.789> all<00:00:17.970> you<00:00:18.210> can<00:00:18.480> put<00:00:18.720> it

00:00:18.830 --> 00:00:18.840 
don't get any lag at all you can put it

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:22.340 
don't get any lag at all you can put it
in<00:00:18.960> 10<00:00:19.880> you<00:00:20.880> can<00:00:21.060> put<00:00:21.300> it<00:00:21.420> in<00:00:21.570> nine<00:00:21.840> twenty<00:00:22.230> by

00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:22.350 
in 10 you can put it in nine twenty by

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:26.089 
in 10 you can put it in nine twenty by
ten<00:00:22.740> eighty<00:00:22.800> but<00:00:23.340> basically<00:00:24.180> Full<00:00:24.570> HD<00:00:24.600> but<00:00:25.560> it

00:00:26.089 --> 00:00:26.099 
ten eighty but basically Full HD but it

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:28.640 
ten eighty but basically Full HD but it
kind<00:00:26.699> of<00:00:26.880> lags<00:00:27.180> a<00:00:27.449> little<00:00:27.720> on<00:00:27.869> some<00:00:28.080> parts<00:00:28.439> and

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:28.650 
kind of lags a little on some parts and

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:30.290 
kind of lags a little on some parts and
it's<00:00:28.890> much<00:00:29.189> better<00:00:29.369> to<00:00:29.609> just<00:00:29.640> have<00:00:29.910> it<00:00:30.029> in<00:00:30.150> this

00:00:30.290 --> 00:00:30.300 
it's much better to just have it in this

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:32.060 
it's much better to just have it in this
resolution<00:00:30.990> if<00:00:31.560> you<00:00:31.679> just<00:00:31.859> put<00:00:32.040> the

00:00:32.060 --> 00:00:32.070 
resolution if you just put the

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:33.620 
resolution if you just put the
brightness<00:00:32.489> up<00:00:32.700> then<00:00:32.940> everything<00:00:33.329> is<00:00:33.450> still

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:33.630 
brightness up then everything is still

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:35.930 
brightness up then everything is still
clear<00:00:33.989> and<00:00:34.170> perfect<00:00:34.530> to<00:00:34.620> see<00:00:34.800> I<00:00:35.040> put<00:00:35.850> the

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:35.940 
clear and perfect to see I put the

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:38.900 
clear and perfect to see I put the
shadows<00:00:36.239> on<00:00:36.390> medium<00:00:36.780> because<00:00:37.290> you<00:00:38.219> know<00:00:38.340> if

00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:38.910 
shadows on medium because you know if

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:40.639 
shadows on medium because you know if
you<00:00:39.090> want<00:00:39.239> it<00:00:39.329> to<00:00:39.540> look<00:00:39.780> realistic<00:00:40.110> put<00:00:40.559> on

00:00:40.639 --> 00:00:40.649 
you want it to look realistic put on

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:44.420 
you want it to look realistic put on
medium<00:00:40.860> because<00:00:41.700> you<00:00:42.030> know<00:00:42.149> outside<00:00:43.430> okay

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:44.430 
medium because you know outside okay

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:46.670 
medium because you know outside okay
actually<00:00:45.260> shadows<00:00:46.260> of<00:00:46.379> your<00:00:46.469> choice

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:46.680 
actually shadows of your choice

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:48.830 
actually shadows of your choice
personally<00:00:47.280> I<00:00:47.399> like<00:00:47.789> it<00:00:47.969> on<00:00:48.120> medium<00:00:48.300> I<00:00:48.660> don't

00:00:48.830 --> 00:00:48.840 
personally I like it on medium I don't

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:52.189 
personally I like it on medium I don't
like<00:00:49.020> it<00:00:49.559> hi<00:00:50.390> this<00:00:51.390> is<00:00:51.480> just<00:00:51.629> my<00:00:51.719> opinion<00:00:52.050> I

00:00:52.189 --> 00:00:52.199 
like it hi this is just my opinion I

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:53.750 
like it hi this is just my opinion I
guess<00:00:52.230> so<00:00:52.800> you<00:00:52.860> can<00:00:53.039> put<00:00:53.160> it<00:00:53.219> on<00:00:53.340> anything<00:00:53.520> you

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:53.760 
guess so you can put it on anything you

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:55.970 
guess so you can put it on anything you
like<00:00:53.940> on<00:00:53.969> the<00:00:54.180> shadows<00:00:54.539> okay<00:00:55.410> so<00:00:55.469> the<00:00:55.680> texture

00:00:55.970 --> 00:00:55.980 
like on the shadows okay so the texture

00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:57.770 
like on the shadows okay so the texture
quality<00:00:56.100> I<00:00:56.340> put<00:00:56.550> on<00:00:56.610> extra<00:00:56.910> so<00:00:57.300> that<00:00:57.449> you<00:00:57.570> don't

00:00:57.770 --> 00:00:57.780 
quality I put on extra so that you don't

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:00.170 
quality I put on extra so that you don't
see<00:00:57.960> any<00:00:58.170> wigglers<00:00:58.859> and<00:00:59.190> textures<00:00:59.670> which

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:00.180 
see any wigglers and textures which

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:03.170 
see any wigglers and textures which
filtering<00:01:00.719> hi<00:01:00.899> answer<00:01:01.350> the<00:01:01.440> aliasing<00:01:02.309> I<00:01:02.579> put

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:03.180 
filtering hi answer the aliasing I put

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:06.440 
filtering hi answer the aliasing I put
off<00:01:03.359> because<00:01:04.350> I<00:01:04.530> put<00:01:04.739> the<00:01:04.860> FXAA<00:01:05.519> so<00:01:05.729> that<00:01:06.240> it

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:06.450 
off because I put the FXAA so that it

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:09.820 
off because I put the FXAA so that it
just<00:01:06.799> the<00:01:07.799> effort<00:01:07.920> say<00:01:08.250> a<00:01:08.280> looks<00:01:08.760> like<00:01:09.270> the

00:01:09.820 --> 00:01:09.830 
just the effort say a looks like the

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:12.560 
just the effort say a looks like the
anti-aliasing<00:01:10.830> when<00:01:11.010> you<00:01:11.100> put<00:01:11.250> it<00:01:11.340> on<00:01:11.490> the<00:01:11.670> you

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:12.570 
anti-aliasing when you put it on the you

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:15.560 
anti-aliasing when you put it on the you
put<00:01:12.720> on<00:01:12.869> TX<00:01:13.520> these<00:01:14.520> are<00:01:14.700> the<00:01:14.760> weird<00:01:14.939> weirdest

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:15.570 
put on TX these are the weird weirdest

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:18.980 
put on TX these are the weird weirdest
words<00:01:15.780> ever<00:01:16.049> anyway<00:01:17.240> that's<00:01:18.240> these<00:01:18.750> are<00:01:18.810> the

00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:18.990 
words ever anyway that's these are the

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:20.510 
words ever anyway that's these are the
settings<00:01:19.170> I<00:01:19.380> have<00:01:19.530> it<00:01:19.619> on<00:01:19.740> and<00:01:20.130> I<00:01:20.220> put<00:01:20.369> it<00:01:20.460> on

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:20.520 
settings I have it on and I put it on

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:21.950 
settings I have it on and I put it on
line<00:01:20.729> under<00:01:21.060> limited<00:01:21.360> so<00:01:21.540> that<00:01:21.689> it<00:01:21.750> doesn't

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:21.960 
line under limited so that it doesn't

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:24.580 
line under limited so that it doesn't
cap<00:01:22.140> it<00:01:22.380> plus<00:01:22.950> um<00:01:23.100> fraps<00:01:23.460> it<00:01:23.790> just

00:01:24.580 --> 00:01:24.590 
cap it plus um fraps it just

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:28.280 
cap it plus um fraps it just
anyway<00:01:25.590> I<00:01:25.619> don't<00:01:26.100> really<00:01:26.460> like<00:01:27.270> vsync<00:01:27.780> I<00:01:28.049> mean

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:28.290 
anyway I don't really like vsync I mean

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:31.910 
anyway I don't really like vsync I mean
it's<00:01:28.619> really<00:01:29.070> nice<00:01:29.220> to<00:01:29.250> see<00:01:30.020> but<00:01:31.020> gets<00:01:31.710> rid<00:01:31.860> of

00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:31.920 
it's really nice to see but gets rid of

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:33.710 
it's really nice to see but gets rid of
so<00:01:32.130> many<00:01:32.250> frames<00:01:32.610> and<00:01:33.000> you<00:01:33.329> know<00:01:33.479> when<00:01:33.600> you're

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:33.720 
so many frames and you know when you're

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:37.219 
so many frames and you know when you're
playing<00:01:33.750> it's<00:01:34.170> not<00:01:34.409> that<00:01:34.619> bad<00:01:34.799> you<00:01:35.250> know<00:01:36.229> okay

00:01:37.219 --> 00:01:37.229 
playing it's not that bad you know okay

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:40.330 
playing it's not that bad you know okay
so<00:01:37.729> that's<00:01:38.729> the<00:01:38.850> settings<00:01:39.150> to<00:01:39.299> go

00:01:40.330 --> 00:01:40.340 
so that's the settings to go

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:44.370 
so that's the settings to go
we<00:01:40.429> can<00:01:40.609> apply<00:01:40.939> those<00:01:41.229> this<00:01:42.229> go<00:01:42.619> online<00:01:42.740> and<00:01:43.280> a

00:01:44.370 --> 00:01:44.380 
we can apply those this go online and a

00:01:44.380 --> 00:01:48.069 
we can apply those this go online and a
lot<00:01:45.380> of<00:01:45.409> a<00:01:45.560> custom<00:01:46.039> game<00:01:46.280> choose<00:01:46.850> a<00:01:46.880> map<00:01:47.179> so<00:01:47.780> the

00:01:48.069 --> 00:01:48.079 
lot of a custom game choose a map so the

00:01:48.079 --> 00:01:51.130 
lot of a custom game choose a map so the
resolution<00:01:48.829> thing<00:01:49.340> when<00:01:50.329> I'm<00:01:50.450> recording<00:01:50.569> I

00:01:51.130 --> 00:01:51.140 
resolution thing when I'm recording I

00:01:51.140 --> 00:01:54.099 
resolution thing when I'm recording I
put<00:01:51.530> it<00:01:51.649> on<00:01:52.149> it's<00:01:53.149> really<00:01:53.479> your<00:01:53.600> choice<00:01:53.840> to<00:01:54.049> be

00:01:54.099 --> 00:01:54.109 
put it on it's really your choice to be

00:01:54.109 --> 00:01:57.100 
put it on it's really your choice to be
honest<00:01:54.409> you<00:01:54.560> can<00:01:54.829> play<00:01:55.069> 1080p<00:01:55.539> it's<00:01:56.539> just<00:01:56.929> as

00:03:27.950 --> 00:03:30.970 

so<00:03:28.610> pretty<00:03:29.360> much<00:03:29.569> the<00:03:29.810> same<00:03:30.020> it's<00:03:30.500> just<00:03:30.800> it's

00:03:30.970 --> 00:03:30.980 
so pretty much the same it's just it's

00:03:30.980 --> 00:03:35.140 
so pretty much the same it's just it's
like<00:03:32.200> this<00:03:33.200> is<00:03:33.440> seven<00:03:33.890> front<00:03:34.220> about<00:03:34.640> nine

00:03:35.140 --> 00:03:35.150 
like this is seven front about nine

00:03:35.150 --> 00:03:38.670 
like this is seven front about nine
frames<00:03:35.510> of<00:03:35.900> ten<00:03:36.200> at<00:03:36.410> the<00:03:36.440> maximum<00:03:36.920> down<00:03:37.610> and

00:03:38.670 --> 00:03:38.680 
frames of ten at the maximum down and

00:03:38.680 --> 00:03:41.320 
frames of ten at the maximum down and
it's<00:03:39.680> actually<00:03:39.860> tearing<00:03:40.459> quite<00:03:40.700> a<00:03:40.730> bit<00:03:40.940> but<00:03:41.180> as

00:03:41.320 --> 00:03:41.330 
it's actually tearing quite a bit but as

00:03:41.330 --> 00:03:43.540 
it's actually tearing quite a bit but as
you<00:03:41.480> can<00:03:41.599> see<00:03:41.780> the<00:03:41.989> quality<00:03:42.230> is<00:03:42.530> much<00:03:42.860> better

00:03:43.540 --> 00:03:43.550 
you can see the quality is much better

00:03:43.550 --> 00:03:47.580 
you can see the quality is much better
it's<00:03:44.540> just<00:03:44.870> I'm<00:03:45.110> playing<00:03:45.440> with<00:03:45.590> the<00:03:45.709> Nvidia<00:03:46.100> GT

00:03:47.580 --> 00:03:47.590 
it's just I'm playing with the Nvidia GT

00:03:47.590 --> 00:03:52.030 
it's just I'm playing with the Nvidia GT
650<00:03:48.590> M<00:03:48.830> so<00:03:49.430> I<00:03:49.760> don't<00:03:50.390> have<00:03:50.480> to<00:03:50.660> 750<00:03:51.590> yet<00:03:51.800> which

00:03:52.030 --> 00:03:52.040 
650 M so I don't have to 750 yet which

00:03:52.040 --> 00:03:57.170 
650 M so I don't have to 750 yet which
is<00:03:52.280> which<00:03:52.640> is<00:03:52.670> what<00:03:53.030> I<00:03:53.090> would<00:03:53.239> answer

00:03:57.170 --> 00:03:57.180 

00:03:57.180 --> 00:04:00.890 

let's<00:03:58.079> just<00:03:58.200> put<00:03:58.379> it<00:03:58.409> back<00:03:58.650> down<00:03:59.420> see<00:04:00.450> to<00:04:00.810> be

00:04:00.890 --> 00:04:00.900 
let's just put it back down see to be

00:04:00.900 --> 00:04:02.420 
let's just put it back down see to be
honest<00:04:01.140> you<00:04:01.230> can<00:04:01.379> see<00:04:01.500> the<00:04:01.620> difference<00:04:01.950> it's<00:04:02.310> a

00:04:02.420 --> 00:04:02.430 
honest you can see the difference it's a

00:04:02.430 --> 00:04:05.929 
honest you can see the difference it's a
tiny<00:04:02.730> bit<00:04:02.879> blurry<00:04:03.360> that's<00:04:03.720> all<00:04:04.370> and<00:04:05.370> you<00:04:05.819> could

00:04:05.929 --> 00:04:05.939 
tiny bit blurry that's all and you could

00:04:05.939 --> 00:04:09.199 
tiny bit blurry that's all and you could
still<00:04:06.299> really<00:04:06.720> play<00:04:06.930> it<00:04:06.989> back<00:04:07.909> and<00:04:08.909> it<00:04:09.030> runs

00:04:09.199 --> 00:04:09.209 
still really play it back and it runs

00:04:09.209 --> 00:04:13.759 
still really play it back and it runs
really<00:04:09.540> well<00:04:09.629> so<00:04:12.409> there<00:04:13.409> you<00:04:13.470> go

00:04:13.759 --> 00:04:13.769 
really well so there you go

00:04:13.769 --> 00:04:16.390 
really well so there you go
I'm<00:04:14.310> not<00:04:14.489> even<00:04:14.819> sure<00:04:14.970> why<00:04:15.180> I<00:04:15.209> am<00:04:15.629> still<00:04:16.109> playing

00:04:16.390 --> 00:04:16.400 
I'm not even sure why I am still playing

00:04:16.400 --> 00:04:27.320 
I'm not even sure why I am still playing
threat<00:04:17.400> neutralized<00:04:26.120> well<00:04:27.120> it's<00:04:27.240> an

00:04:27.320 --> 00:04:27.330 
threat neutralized well it's an

00:04:27.330 --> 00:04:31.520 
threat neutralized well it's an
automatic<00:04:27.870> fail<00:04:29.750> so<00:04:30.750> just<00:04:30.960> go<00:04:31.110> through<00:04:31.350> them

00:04:31.520 --> 00:04:31.530 
automatic fail so just go through them

00:04:31.530 --> 00:04:34.400 
automatic fail so just go through them
again<00:04:31.729> you<00:04:32.729> can<00:04:32.880> put<00:04:33.060> the<00:04:33.300> anti-aliasing<00:04:33.990> ons

00:04:34.400 --> 00:04:34.410 
again you can put the anti-aliasing ons

00:04:34.410 --> 00:04:37.969 
again you can put the anti-aliasing ons
just<00:04:34.919> it<00:04:35.570> it's<00:04:36.570> like<00:04:36.780> not<00:04:37.080> a<00:04:37.110> huge<00:04:37.560> difference

00:04:37.969 --> 00:04:37.979 
just it it's like not a huge difference

00:04:37.979 --> 00:04:40.040 
just it it's like not a huge difference
I<00:04:38.220> mean<00:04:38.729> it<00:04:38.850> makes<00:04:39.000> the<00:04:39.150> game<00:04:39.300> look<00:04:39.479> nicer

00:04:40.040 --> 00:04:40.050 
I mean it makes the game look nicer

00:04:40.050 --> 00:04:42.320 
I mean it makes the game look nicer
obviously<00:04:40.560> a<00:04:40.949> bit<00:04:41.490> more<00:04:41.669> smoother<00:04:42.090> you<00:04:42.180> could

00:04:42.320 --> 00:04:42.330 
obviously a bit more smoother you could

00:04:42.330 --> 00:05:05.060 
obviously a bit more smoother you could
say<00:05:00.530> hunter<00:05:01.530> killer<00:05:01.740> drone<00:05:01.830> deployed<00:05:04.070> UAV

00:05:05.060 --> 00:05:05.070 
say hunter killer drone deployed UAV

00:05:05.070 --> 00:05:10.029 
say hunter killer drone deployed UAV
inbound<00:05:06.590> hostiles<00:05:07.590> have<00:05:07.800> destroyed<00:05:08.190> your<00:05:08.370> UAV

00:05:10.029 --> 00:05:10.039 
inbound hostiles have destroyed your UAV

00:05:10.039 --> 00:05:12.129 
inbound hostiles have destroyed your UAV
UAV<00:05:11.039> inbound

00:05:12.129 --> 00:05:12.139 
UAV inbound

00:05:12.139 --> 00:05:21.950 
UAV inbound
friendly<00:05:13.139> rcxd<00:05:13.320> inbound

00:05:21.950 --> 00:05:21.960 

00:05:21.960 --> 00:05:37.260 

yeah<00:05:34.470> okay<00:05:35.470> would<00:05:35.710> cut<00:05:35.889> back<00:05:35.919> I<00:05:36.729> just<00:05:37.150> found

00:05:37.260 --> 00:05:37.270 
yeah okay would cut back I just found

00:05:37.270 --> 00:05:39.570 
yeah okay would cut back I just found
out<00:05:37.479> that<00:05:37.599> the<00:05:37.750> anti-aliasing<00:05:38.500> is<00:05:38.889> perfect

00:05:39.570 --> 00:05:39.580 
out that the anti-aliasing is perfect

00:05:39.580 --> 00:05:41.610 
out that the anti-aliasing is perfect
actually<00:05:39.789> it<00:05:40.120> runs<00:05:40.300> fine<00:05:40.599> you<00:05:41.199> can<00:05:41.349> you<00:05:41.410> put

00:05:41.610 --> 00:05:41.620 
actually it runs fine you can you put

00:05:41.620 --> 00:05:48.059 
actually it runs fine you can you put
this<00:05:41.800> on<00:05:42.009> see<00:05:42.610> 60s<00:05:45.360> well<00:05:46.360> girl<00:05:46.599> I<00:05:46.780> will<00:05:47.050> try<00:05:48.039> a

00:05:48.059 --> 00:05:48.069 
this on see 60s well girl I will try a

00:05:48.069 --> 00:05:50.460 
this on see 60s well girl I will try a
bigger<00:05:48.490> map<00:05:48.729> just<00:05:49.030> so<00:05:49.270> I<00:05:49.810> can<00:05:49.960> check<00:05:50.259> on<00:05:50.410> that

00:05:50.460 --> 00:05:50.470 
bigger map just so I can check on that

00:05:50.470 --> 00:05:53.820 
bigger map just so I can check on that
but<00:05:51.370> 60<00:05:51.699> FPS<00:05:52.030> on<00:05:52.270> this<00:05:52.690> resolution<00:05:52.900> with<00:05:53.680> the

00:05:53.820 --> 00:05:53.830 
but 60 FPS on this resolution with the

00:05:53.830 --> 00:05:56.490 
but 60 FPS on this resolution with the
high<00:05:53.949> settings<00:05:54.400> it<00:05:54.789> runs<00:05:55.090> perfectly<00:05:55.810> and

00:05:56.490 --> 00:05:56.500 
high settings it runs perfectly and

00:05:56.500 --> 00:05:58.110 
high settings it runs perfectly and
doesn't<00:05:56.740> even<00:05:56.860> look<00:05:57.130> that<00:05:57.340> bad<00:05:57.550> you<00:05:57.789> know<00:05:57.910> it

00:05:58.110 --> 00:05:58.120 
doesn't even look that bad you know it

00:05:58.120 --> 00:06:01.800 
doesn't even look that bad you know it
looks<00:05:58.270> great<00:05:59.130> I<00:06:00.300> should<00:06:01.300> do<00:06:01.449> a<00:06:01.479> video<00:06:01.690> on
