 aaaaaaaaaa. 

00:00:04.770 --> 00:00:07.770
 aaaah 

00:00:25.829 --> 00:00:28.769
 flight 

00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:31.769
 aaaaaaah 

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:37.700
 a beautiful smile is an important business card for the world around us 

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:40.700
 but when the teeth are not exactly in good shape it is certainly necessary 

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:44.710
 intervene what happened to pamela and this is her story 

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:50.620
 hi i'm panmedia and i'm 25 years old 

00:00:50.620 --> 00:00:55.780
 I'm studying to learn how to dance and sing cigarettes as a child instead 

00:00:55.780 --> 00:00:57.710
 go to Latin American dances 

00:00:57.710 --> 00:01:00.560
 especially the music 

00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:03.090
 the characteristic of this bread 

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:05.350
 because the legs must stay here 

00:01:05.350 --> 00:01:06.550
 enpals cinotti 

00:01:06.550 --> 00:01:09.120
 move in a sensual way 

00:01:09.120 --> 00:01:10.610
 when female dancers 

00:01:10.610 --> 00:01:14.570
 I can spend a lot of my character what I can't do in life 

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:15.530
 of all 

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:18.530
 because I am very shy 

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:26.100
 another way to express my sense of storm 

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:32.190
 as the cantarini dance frees in particular I like to sing the songs 

00:01:32.189 --> 00:01:36.229
 Italians because the words of our soul language act mediaset 

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:38.410
 to be a true singer 

00:01:38.410 --> 00:01:40.750
 you have to look good 

00:01:40.750 --> 00:01:44.920
 I have a beautiful voice that must reach people's hearts and that is why 

00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:47.920
 I'll have to study so much to keep going 

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:54.290
 and we felt the protagonist of this evening our friend pamela who 

00:01:54.290 --> 00:01:56.560
 like so many people should enter 

00:01:56.560 --> 00:02:01.320
 in the world of entertainment and this handicap and this difficulty 

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:03.829
 in expressing flatness smile precisely because 

00:02:03.829 --> 00:02:08.359
 the teeth is not perfectly aligned many people will recognize themselves 

00:02:08.359 --> 00:02:12.369
 in the history of pamela big network have seen that age is not that 

00:02:12.369 --> 00:02:13.459
 definitely one 

00:02:13.459 --> 00:02:18.719
 very small and in kindergarten but this makes us think that she is ident 

00:02:18.719 --> 00:02:23.459
 You can correct them at any age and it is never too late then 

00:02:23.459 --> 00:02:26.910
 we will talk vania specialist challenges step sub ita present you 

00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:31.620
 to my left donated berrini dental technician good evening and welcome back 

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:35.810
 close to Dr. Mari Mariella from Micco Psychologist and Psychotherapist 

00:02:35.810 --> 00:02:40.160
 Good evening and then again Dr. Stefano Sala laughed that he is responsible for 

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:44.670
 department of preventive dentistry at the I would have hospitable Rome 

00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:46.870
 the plastic and rome surgery institute 

00:02:46.870 --> 00:02:49.009
 good evening is the time reserve 

00:02:49.009 --> 00:02:50.810
 first laugh 

00:02:50.810 --> 00:02:53.810
 with this concept it is never too late to intervene. 

00:02:54.420 --> 00:02:58.549
 because many ladies are writing no except you and me the story but 

00:02:58.549 --> 00:03:01.929
 beuys to the transmission that often doctor ferrari 

00:03:01.929 --> 00:03:05.839
 I am 30 years old and I am 40 and maybe realign my teeth has a little 

00:03:06.399 --> 00:03:08.919
 what made the head late 

00:03:08.919 --> 00:03:10.579
 what's not like that 

00:03:10.579 --> 00:03:16.079
 Today we say it is possible yesterday to realign identities at any age 

00:03:16.079 --> 00:03:17.199
 clearly 

00:03:17.199 --> 00:03:20.249
 and it is clear that even more people 

00:03:21.419 --> 00:03:24.829
 older this is a flaw that is still noticeable because 

00:03:24.829 --> 00:03:26.199
 we say in the 

00:03:26.199 --> 00:03:29.549
 in previous generations it was difficult 

00:03:29.549 --> 00:03:32.019
 these gentlemen were taken to the dentist 

00:03:32.019 --> 00:03:35.279
 so often we have to intervene every day 

00:03:35.279 --> 00:03:39.369
 more easily on people of a certain age where blemishes are 

00:03:39.369 --> 00:03:41.649
 certainly more respect instead 

00:03:41.649 --> 00:03:45.319
 reggio emilia today that are followed right from the beginning of childhood 

00:03:45.319 --> 00:03:46.870
 it's surely 

00:03:46.870 --> 00:03:51.570
 we will find ourselves saying with respect to their parents with certainly a set of teeth 

00:03:51.569 --> 00:03:58.249
 more same is aligned with them so our interventions center 

00:03:58.249 --> 00:04:02.159
 let's say they are if you had accounts not made on people even of a certain 

00:04:02.159 --> 00:04:03.119
 age 

00:04:03.119 --> 00:04:07.029
 how grazio diet of the technologies that allow us to 

00:04:07.029 --> 00:04:08.179
 face up to 

00:04:08.179 --> 00:04:09.459
 hehe 

00:04:09.459 --> 00:04:12.269
 let's say any kind of problem especially 

00:04:12.269 --> 00:04:16.910
 in a fairly unobtrusive way, today there are many devices 

00:04:16.910 --> 00:04:21.579
 equipment of the type invisible orthodontics lingual orthodontics that ad 

00:04:21.579 --> 00:04:26.479
 example allow us to go to correct demal dental positions 

00:04:26.479 --> 00:04:29.289
 for your own or without anyone noticing 

00:04:29.289 --> 00:04:32.939
 or you can decide not to perform as see me chase you. 

00:04:33.809 --> 00:04:37.460
 a study in both different you allow yourself one to go to 

00:04:37.460 --> 00:04:38.819
 modify 

00:04:38.819 --> 00:04:43.110
 the position of the teeth that casinha also clearly change the shape the 

00:04:43.110 --> 00:04:46.419
 tooth color that what a little is everyone's dream to get to see 

00:04:46.419 --> 00:04:48.719
 the sun not just the location 

00:04:48.719 --> 00:04:53.529
 but also the shape and the color because once without it was only a prerogative 

00:04:53.529 --> 00:04:59.150
 of the big Hollywood stars to see these teeth so I also had shining 

00:04:59.149 --> 00:05:02.279
 instead no accessory. there is a technique as explained 

00:05:02.279 --> 00:05:06.129
 better salaries so that it is possible to do here in Italy to advise me 

00:05:06.129 --> 00:05:09.689
 definitely existing then dynamic text 

00:05:09.689 --> 00:05:14.029
 because it is so important to smile and then because the people who succeed in 

00:05:14.029 --> 00:05:17.029
 smile to appear cameroon composes the character 

00:05:17.529 --> 00:05:21.799
 machines smile is a communication technique for any language 

00:05:22.339 --> 00:05:27.339
 so when he meets a person in another culture another language smiles 

00:05:27.339 --> 00:05:30.939
 it reassures us regardless of the content of what you can tell us 

00:05:30.939 --> 00:05:32.919
 if I thought if we don't understand it 

00:05:32.919 --> 00:05:37.169
 and therefore there could also be a gounod dichotomy between the content and 

00:05:37.169 --> 00:05:41.049
 the expression smile that thing that we perceive more the smile that is 

00:05:41.620 --> 00:05:48.560
 I would avoid reassuring for children and we have a smile as a human race 

00:05:48.560 --> 00:05:49.819

00:05:54.620 --> 00:05:57.559
 and we smile only 

00:05:57.559 --> 00:06:00.639
 we have a smile with us 

00:06:00.639 --> 00:06:03.909
 it is not a political part of Trieste 

00:06:03.909 --> 00:06:04.960
 teeth 

00:06:04.960 --> 00:06:08.990
 that is to say I also now as a means of communication certainly in Verona 

00:06:08.990 --> 00:06:11.490
 then it is a business card 

00:06:11.490 --> 00:06:15.050
 important knot the other also from the cultural point of view 

00:06:15.050 --> 00:06:18.530
 all this what I call the concert time for which the smile is 

00:06:18.530 --> 00:06:22.700
