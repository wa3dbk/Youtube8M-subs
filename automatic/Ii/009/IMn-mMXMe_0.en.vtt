choose from

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:51.109 
choose from
once<00:01:49.710> you've<00:01:49.890> reincarnate<00:01:50.399> into<00:01:50.610> one<00:01:50.909> of<00:01:51.030> them

so that's sort of based into the story
you<00:01:53.189> reincarnate<00:01:53.549> and<00:01:54.030> do<00:01:54.090> this<00:01:54.210> thing<00:01:54.360> this

00:01:54.499 --> 00:01:54.509 
you reincarnate and do this thing this

00:01:54.509 --> 00:01:56.270 
you reincarnate and do this thing this
is<00:01:54.570> a<00:01:54.630> really<00:01:54.869> interesting<00:01:55.020> world<00:01:55.740> more<00:01:56.040> and

00:01:58.459 --> 00:01:58.469 
mechanics to everything but anyways you

00:01:58.469 --> 00:02:00.469 
mechanics to everything but anyways you
reincarnate<00:01:58.710> into<00:01:59.189> a<00:01:59.219> class<00:01:59.490> and<00:01:59.729> while<00:02:00.360> the

00:02:00.469 --> 00:02:00.479 
reincarnate into a class and while the
