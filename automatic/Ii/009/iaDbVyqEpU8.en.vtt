what's<00:00:00.450> up<00:00:00.570> guys<00:00:00.780> so<00:00:01.079> they<00:00:01.170> have<00:00:01.319> an<00:00:01.410> unboxing

00:00:01.699 --> 00:00:01.709 
what's up guys so they have an unboxing

00:00:01.709 --> 00:00:05.570 
what's up guys so they have an unboxing
of<00:00:02.070> the<00:00:02.250> Sapphire<00:00:02.820> Radeon<00:00:03.060> r7<00:00:03.750> 265<00:00:04.710> graphics

00:00:05.570 --> 00:00:05.580 
of the Sapphire Radeon r7 265 graphics

00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:13.610 
of the Sapphire Radeon r7 265 graphics
card<00:00:11.330> so<00:00:12.330> I<00:00:12.360> have<00:00:12.509> done<00:00:12.690> an<00:00:12.840> unboxing<00:00:13.200> and

00:00:13.610 --> 00:00:13.620 
card so I have done an unboxing and

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:16.880 
card so I have done an unboxing and
review<00:00:14.070> of<00:00:14.099> the<00:00:14.460> r7<00:00:14.940> 260x<00:00:15.450> but<00:00:16.199> this<00:00:16.410> time<00:00:16.680> we

00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:16.890 
review of the r7 260x but this time we

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:19.130 
review of the r7 260x but this time we
have<00:00:17.070> the<00:00:17.190> bigger<00:00:17.430> brother<00:00:17.699> it's<00:00:18.270> a<00:00:18.449> a<00:00:18.570> Radeon

00:00:19.130 --> 00:00:19.140 
have the bigger brother it's a a Radeon

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:23.120 
have the bigger brother it's a a Radeon
r7<00:00:19.500> 265<00:00:20.400> this<00:00:21.300> GPU<00:00:21.810> has<00:00:22.020> a<00:00:22.050> price<00:00:22.380> range<00:00:22.710> close

00:00:23.120 --> 00:00:23.130 
r7 265 this GPU has a price range close

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:26.330 
r7 265 this GPU has a price range close
to<00:00:23.310> the<00:00:23.430> r7<00:00:23.910> 260x<00:00:24.449> but<00:00:25.350> the<00:00:25.439> performance<00:00:26.160> is

00:00:26.330 --> 00:00:26.340 
to the r7 260x but the performance is

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:29.240 
to the r7 260x but the performance is
closer<00:00:26.699> to<00:00:26.880> the<00:00:27.090> r9<00:00:27.269> 270<00:00:28.230> so<00:00:28.740> the<00:00:28.859> price<00:00:29.070> to

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:29.250 
closer to the r9 270 so the price to

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:32.060 
closer to the r9 270 so the price to
performance<00:00:29.429> ratio<00:00:29.880> is<00:00:30.359> pretty<00:00:30.630> good<00:00:30.990> so<00:00:31.740> this

00:00:32.060 --> 00:00:32.070 
performance ratio is pretty good so this

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:34.430 
performance ratio is pretty good so this

Guide some other documentation and of
course<00:01:21.810> the<00:01:21.990> graphics<00:01:22.409> card<00:01:22.680> itself<00:01:23.100> in<00:01:23.310> an

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:23.430 
course the graphics card itself in an

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:26.060 
course the graphics card itself in an
anti-static<00:01:23.939> bag<00:01:24.299> let's<00:01:25.140> now<00:01:25.290> take<00:01:25.350> a<00:01:25.560> look<00:01:25.860> at

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:26.070 
anti-static bag let's now take a look at

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:27.649 
anti-static bag let's now take a look at
the<00:01:26.189> graphics<00:01:26.580> card<00:01:26.790> itself<00:01:27.060> so<00:01:27.390> as<00:01:27.479> you<00:01:27.600> can

00:01:27.649 --> 00:01:27.659 
the graphics card itself so as you can

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:30.200 
the graphics card itself so as you can
see<00:01:28.020> it<00:01:28.259> has<00:01:28.799> this<00:01:28.979> black<00:01:29.310> and<00:01:29.610> silver<00:01:29.790> scheme

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:30.210 
see it has this black and silver scheme

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:32.719 
see it has this black and silver scheme
with<00:01:30.720> a<00:01:30.750> dual<00:01:30.960> X<00:01:31.259> fan<00:01:31.590> on<00:01:31.829> top<00:01:31.860> so<00:01:32.430> this<00:01:32.549> is

00:01:32.719 --> 00:01:32.729 
with a dual X fan on top so this is

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:35.179 
with a dual X fan on top so this is
aimed<00:01:32.970> this<00:01:33.210> way<00:01:33.540> of<00:01:33.840> keeping<00:01:34.350> your<00:01:34.439> GPU<00:01:34.950> and

00:01:35.179 --> 00:01:35.189 
aimed this way of keeping your GPU and

00:01:35.189 --> 00:01:38.210 
aimed this way of keeping your GPU and
full<00:01:35.430> load<00:01:35.670> or<00:01:36.060> with<00:01:36.570> an<00:01:36.720> overclock<00:01:37.560> cool<00:01:37.950> and
