00:00:57.200 --> 00:00:57.210 
got a sample HTML document that we're

00:00:57.210 --> 00:00:58.910 
got a sample HTML document that we're
going<00:00:57.300> to<00:00:57.360> be<00:00:57.480> working<00:00:57.899> with<00:00:58.079> in<00:00:58.469> this

00:00:58.910 --> 00:00:58.920 
going to be working with in this

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:02.720 
going to be working with in this
exercise<00:00:59.510> now<00:01:00.510> as<00:01:01.140> far<00:01:01.379> as<00:01:01.440> CSS<00:01:01.949> Styles<00:01:02.489> go

exercise now as far as CSS Styles go
there<00:01:02.940> are<00:01:03.059> three<00:01:03.449> places<00:01:03.870> that<00:01:04.290> they<00:01:04.439> can<00:01:04.500> be

00:01:04.729 --> 00:01:04.739 
there are three places that they can be

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:08.620 
there are three places that they can be
created<00:01:05.189> you<00:01:06.150> can<00:01:06.299> create<00:01:06.570> CSS<00:01:07.110> Styles<00:01:07.530> inline

00:01:08.620 --> 00:01:08.630 
created you can create CSS Styles inline

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:12.140 
created you can create CSS Styles inline
internally<00:01:09.630> or<00:01:10.049> in<00:01:10.650> an<00:01:10.799> external<00:01:11.280> stylesheet

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:12.150 
internally or in an external stylesheet

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:15.080 
internally or in an external stylesheet
in<00:01:12.860> this<00:01:13.860> class<00:01:14.100> we're<00:01:14.430> going<00:01:14.640> to<00:01:14.729> assume<00:01:15.030> that

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:15.090 
in this class we're going to assume that

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:17.570 
in this class we're going to assume that
all<00:01:15.479> of<00:01:15.720> your<00:01:15.840> Styles<00:01:16.350> are<00:01:16.650> always<00:01:17.280> going<00:01:17.460> to

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:17.580 
all of your Styles are always going to

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:20.480 
all of your Styles are always going to
be<00:01:17.640> kept<00:01:17.970> in<00:01:18.240> external<00:01:18.659> style<00:01:19.170> sheets<00:01:19.490> that's

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:20.490 
be kept in external style sheets that's

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:22.249 
be kept in external style sheets that's
going<00:01:20.700> to<00:01:20.790> give<00:01:20.909> you<00:01:21.000> the<00:01:21.180> maximum<00:01:21.479> amount<00:01:21.930> of

00:01:22.249 --> 00:01:22.259 
going to give you the maximum amount of

00:01:22.259 --> 00:01:24.530 
going to give you the maximum amount of
flexibility<00:01:22.920> in<00:01:23.070> the<00:01:23.159> maximum<00:01:23.700> use<00:01:24.030> of<00:01:24.299> the

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:24.540 
flexibility in the maximum use of the

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:26.719 
flexibility in the maximum use of the
work<00:01:24.930> you<00:01:25.200> put<00:01:25.380> into<00:01:25.560> your<00:01:25.680> style<00:01:26.070> sheets<00:01:26.430> and

00:01:26.719 --> 00:01:26.729 
work you put into your style sheets and

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:28.609 
work you put into your style sheets and
generally<00:01:27.540> I<00:01:27.570> think<00:01:27.720> you<00:01:28.110> should<00:01:28.290> avoid

00:01:28.609 --> 00:01:28.619 
generally I think you should avoid

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:31.850 
generally I think you should avoid
inline<00:01:29.310> Styles<00:01:29.970> if<00:01:30.600> at<00:01:30.810> all<00:01:30.930> possible<00:01:30.990> and

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:31.860 
inline Styles if at all possible and

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:34.760 
inline Styles if at all possible and
only<00:01:32.700> use<00:01:33.060> internal<00:01:33.689> style<00:01:33.960> Styles<00:01:34.530> that<00:01:34.650> are

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:34.770 
only use internal style Styles that are

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:36.740 
only use internal style Styles that are
kept<00:01:34.979> internally<00:01:35.670> in<00:01:35.790> the<00:01:35.909> head<00:01:36.119> section<00:01:36.479> of

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:36.750 
kept internally in the head section of
