00:01:56.749 --> 00:01:56.759 
which is know over the course of

00:01:56.759 --> 00:01:59.749 
which is know over the course of
multiple<00:01:57.299> meals<00:01:57.829> adds<00:01:58.829> up<00:01:59.130> that's<00:01:59.549> pretty

00:01:59.749 --> 00:01:59.759 
multiple meals adds up that's pretty

00:01:59.759 --> 00:02:01.249 
multiple meals adds up that's pretty
cool<00:01:59.909> you<00:02:00.210> know<00:02:00.270> I<00:02:00.329> talked<00:02:00.540> about<00:02:00.719> cereals

00:02:01.249 --> 00:02:01.259 
cool you know I talked about cereals

00:02:01.259 --> 00:02:03.590 
cool you know I talked about cereals
earlier<00:02:01.680> and<00:02:01.920> you<00:02:02.399> know<00:02:02.490> raisin<00:02:02.969> flakes

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:03.600 
earlier and you know raisin flakes

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:05.539 
earlier and you know raisin flakes
cereals<00:02:03.960> it's<00:02:04.649> a<00:02:04.710> great<00:02:04.890> cereal<00:02:05.250> but

00:02:05.539 --> 00:02:05.549 
cereals it's a great cereal but

00:02:05.549 --> 00:02:07.039 
cereals it's a great cereal but
sometimes<00:02:05.850> the<00:02:05.969> grapes<00:02:06.240> might<00:02:06.600> be<00:02:06.719> sprayed

00:02:07.039 --> 00:02:07.049 
sometimes the grapes might be sprayed

00:02:07.049 --> 00:02:08.540 
sometimes the grapes might be sprayed
with<00:02:07.200> pesticides<00:02:07.409> so<00:02:07.890> I<00:02:07.920> kind<00:02:08.099> of<00:02:08.129> worry<00:02:08.399> if

00:02:08.540 --> 00:02:08.550 
with pesticides so I kind of worry if

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:10.070 
with pesticides so I kind of worry if
that's<00:02:08.729> really<00:02:09.000> all<00:02:09.119> that<00:02:09.149> good<00:02:09.390> for<00:02:09.539> you<00:02:09.599> but

00:02:10.070 --> 00:02:10.080 
that's really all that good for you but

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:12.740 
that's really all that good for you but
we<00:02:10.649> found<00:02:10.920> this<00:02:11.700> is<00:02:11.940> an<00:02:12.090> example<00:02:12.360> of<00:02:12.510> it<00:02:12.690> you

00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:12.750 
we found this is an example of it you

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:13.670 
we found this is an example of it you
can<00:02:12.900> actually<00:02:13.290> organic

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:13.680 
can actually organic

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:15.470 
can actually organic
could<00:02:13.799> be<00:02:13.890> cheaper<00:02:14.189> this<00:02:14.489> is<00:02:14.730> a<00:02:14.760> the<00:02:15.209> raisin

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:15.480 
could be cheaper this is a the raisin

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:17.660 
could be cheaper this is a the raisin
flake<00:02:15.659> cereal<00:02:15.810> was<00:02:16.170> 399<00:02:16.890> at<00:02:17.159> the<00:02:17.340> regular

00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:17.670 
flake cereal was 399 at the regular

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:20.030 
flake cereal was 399 at the regular
grocery<00:02:17.939> store<00:02:18.390> but<00:02:18.810> this<00:02:18.989> organic<00:02:19.349> raisin

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:20.040 
grocery store but this organic raisin

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:22.009 
grocery store but this organic raisin
flake<00:02:20.189> cereal<00:02:20.370> was<00:02:20.700> a<00:02:20.730> dollar<00:02:21.090> cheaper<00:02:21.450> at<00:02:21.840> the

00:02:22.009 --> 00:02:22.019 
flake cereal was a dollar cheaper at the

00:02:22.019 --> 00:02:25.160 
flake cereal was a dollar cheaper at the
high-end<00:02:22.439> specialty<00:02:23.040> store<00:02:23.549> so<00:02:24.420> I<00:02:24.450> mean<00:02:24.810> right

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:25.170 
high-end specialty store so I mean right

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:26.959 
high-end specialty store so I mean right
there<00:02:25.349> it's<00:02:25.709> cheaper<00:02:26.040> if<00:02:26.219> you<00:02:26.370> just<00:02:26.760> look

00:02:26.959 --> 00:02:26.969 
there it's cheaper if you just look

00:02:26.969 --> 00:02:28.039 
there it's cheaper if you just look
around

00:02:28.039 --> 00:02:28.049 
around

00:02:28.049 --> 00:02:30.020

good snacks it sometimes crackers but
instead<00:02:59.609> of<00:02:59.669> getting<00:02:59.909> this<00:03:00.359> which<00:03:00.719> is

00:03:00.830 --> 00:03:00.840 
instead of getting this which is

00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:02.509 
instead of getting this which is
equivalent<00:03:01.169> this<00:03:01.469> bowl<00:03:01.739> of<00:03:01.769> cheese<00:03:02.340> crackers

00:03:02.509 --> 00:03:02.519 
equivalent this bowl of cheese crackers

00:03:02.519 --> 00:03:04.640 
equivalent this bowl of cheese crackers
which<00:03:02.879> is<00:03:03.000> equivalent<00:03:03.269> to<00:03:03.480> a<00:03:03.569> box<00:03:03.900> which<00:03:04.469> would

00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:04.650 
which is equivalent to a box which would

00:03:04.650 --> 00:03:06.949 
which is equivalent to a box which would
cost<00:03:04.859> about<00:03:05.189> $5<00:03:06.060> and<00:03:06.269> which<00:03:06.359> is<00:03:06.510> high<00:03:06.750> in

00:03:06.949 --> 00:03:06.959 
cost about $5 and which is high in

00:03:09.629 --> 00:03:11.449 
sodium high in fat and low in nutrition
you<00:03:09.750> could<00:03:09.900> buy<00:03:10.079> a<00:03:10.379> box<00:03:10.620> of<00:03:10.799> organic<00:03:10.950> cheese

00:03:11.449 --> 00:03:11.459 
you could buy a box of organic cheese

you could buy a box of organic cheese
crackers<00:03:11.939> which<00:03:12.120> is<00:03:12.239> in<00:03:12.419> this<00:03:12.540> bowl<00:03:12.810> for<00:03:13.260> 349

00:03:13.889 --> 00:03:15.800 
crackers which is in this bowl for 349
you<00:03:14.700> know<00:03:14.790> and<00:03:14.909> it's<00:03:15.030> really<00:03:15.299> important<00:03:15.750> I

00:03:15.800 --> 00:03:15.810 
you know and it's really important I

00:03:15.810 --> 00:03:17.539 
you know and it's really important I
think<00:03:15.870> we've<00:03:16.769> talked<00:03:17.040> about<00:03:17.129> this<00:03:17.340> on<00:03:17.459> the

00:03:17.539 --> 00:03:17.549 
think we've talked about this on the

00:03:17.549 --> 00:03:19.339 
think we've talked about this on the
show<00:03:17.699> before<00:03:17.729> there<00:03:18.120> are<00:03:18.150> so<00:03:18.449> many<00:03:18.659> thousands

00:03:19.339 --> 00:03:19.349 
show before there are so many thousands

00:03:19.349 --> 00:03:21.500 
show before there are so many thousands
of<00:03:19.500> chemicals<00:03:20.010> out<00:03:20.129> there<00:03:20.190> they're<00:03:21.150> they're

00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:21.510 
of chemicals out there they're they're

00:03:21.510 --> 00:03:23.780 
of chemicals out there they're they're
dangerous<00:03:22.079> there's<00:03:22.560> over<00:03:22.739> 80,000<00:03:23.579> chemicals

00:03:23.780 --> 00:03:23.790 
dangerous there's over 80,000 chemicals

00:03:23.790 --> 00:03:27.740 
dangerous there's over 80,000 chemicals
in<00:03:24.720> the<00:03:25.500> environment<00:03:26.069> that<00:03:26.340> are<00:03:26.699> the<00:03:27.449> majority

00:03:27.740 --> 00:03:27.750 
in the environment that are the majority

00:03:27.750 --> 00:03:29.240 
in the environment that are the majority
of<00:03:27.930> which<00:03:28.079> have<00:03:28.229> never<00:03:28.409> been<00:03:28.739> tested<00:03:28.949> before

00:03:29.240 --> 00:03:29.250 
of which have never been tested before

00:03:29.250 --> 00:03:31.640 
of which have never been tested before
so<00:03:30.090> on<00:03:30.359> human<00:03:30.629> health<00:03:30.750> we're<00:03:31.049> the<00:03:31.199> guinea<00:03:31.319> pigs

00:03:31.640 --> 00:03:31.650 
so on human health we're the guinea pigs

00:03:31.650 --> 00:03:33.379 
so on human health we're the guinea pigs
are<00:03:31.979> CH<00:03:32.010> our<00:03:32.370> children<00:03:32.760> are<00:03:32.879> the<00:03:32.970> guinea<00:03:33.090> pigs

00:03:33.379 --> 00:03:33.389 
are CH our children are the guinea pigs

00:03:33.389 --> 00:03:35.839 
are CH our children are the guinea pigs
so<00:03:34.049> it's<00:03:34.470> becoming<00:03:34.739> more<00:03:35.159> and<00:03:35.220> more<00:03:35.370> urgent

00:03:35.839 --> 00:03:35.849 
so it's becoming more and more urgent

00:03:35.849 --> 00:03:38.390
