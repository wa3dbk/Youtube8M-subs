the song was his favorite dance song and

00:00:14.759 --> 00:00:15.980 
the song was his favorite dance song and
a<00:00:14.969> lot<00:00:15.089> of<00:00:15.120> other<00:00:15.269> people<00:00:15.570> there<00:00:15.690> wanted<00:00:15.929> to

00:00:15.980 --> 00:00:15.990 
a lot of other people there wanted to

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:17.779 
a lot of other people there wanted to
hear<00:00:16.289> it<00:00:16.410> and<00:00:16.560> they<00:00:17.100> didn't<00:00:17.340> understand<00:00:17.699> why

00:00:17.779 --> 00:00:17.789 
hear it and they didn't understand why

00:00:17.789 --> 00:00:19.820 
hear it and they didn't understand why
that<00:00:17.820> deejay<00:00:18.390> wouldn't<00:00:19.109> play<00:00:19.380> it<00:00:19.410> and

00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:19.830 
that deejay wouldn't play it and

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:21.890 
that deejay wouldn't play it and
sometimes<00:00:20.699> we<00:00:20.880> can<00:00:21.029> actually<00:00:21.060> get<00:00:21.660> harassed

00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:21.900 
sometimes we can actually get harassed

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:23.950 
sometimes we can actually get harassed
about<00:00:22.470> this<00:00:22.680> we're<00:00:22.859> getting<00:00:22.949> yelled<00:00:23.400> at<00:00:23.670> and

00:00:23.950 --> 00:00:23.960 
about this we're getting yelled at and

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:25.700 
about this we're getting yelled at and
that<00:00:24.960> sucks

00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:25.710 
that sucks

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:28.400 
that sucks
so<00:00:26.490> I<00:00:26.880> think<00:00:27.180> a<00:00:27.539> lot<00:00:27.689> of<00:00:27.720> it's<00:00:27.930> our<00:00:28.109> fault

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:28.410 
so I think a lot of it's our fault

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:31.640 
so I think a lot of it's our fault
really<00:00:29.300> because<00:00:30.300> a<00:00:30.779> lot<00:00:31.289> of<00:00:31.320> this<00:00:31.500> could<00:00:31.619> have

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:31.650 
really because a lot of this could have

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:35.060 
really because a lot of this could have
been<00:00:31.769> avoided<00:00:32.130> in<00:00:32.460> the<00:00:32.520> prep<00:00:33.329> of<00:00:33.570> the<00:00:33.719> gig<00:00:34.070> I'll

00:00:35.060 --> 00:00:35.070 
been avoided in the prep of the gig I'll

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:37.360 
been avoided in the prep of the gig I'll
give<00:00:35.250> you<00:00:35.370> some<00:00:35.610> examples<00:00:36.239> of<00:00:36.360> what<00:00:36.510> we<00:00:36.570> can<00:00:36.719> do

00:00:37.360 --> 00:00:37.370 
give you some examples of what we can do

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:41.240 
give you some examples of what we can do
now<00:00:38.370> on<00:00:38.610> my<00:00:38.969> agency's<00:00:40.070> paperwork<00:00:41.070> that<00:00:41.190> they

00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:41.250 
now on my agency's paperwork that they

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:42.830 
now on my agency's paperwork that they
send<00:00:41.610> out<00:00:41.700> to<00:00:41.760> everybody<00:00:41.940> they<00:00:42.360> got<00:00:42.540> an<00:00:42.629> online

00:00:42.830 --> 00:00:42.840 
send out to everybody they got an online

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:45.260 
send out to everybody they got an online
sheet<00:00:43.410> there's<00:00:43.920> actually<00:00:44.399> a<00:00:44.430> columnist<00:00:45.059> says

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:45.270 
sheet there's actually a columnist says

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:47.990 
sheet there's actually a columnist says
don't<00:00:45.570> play<00:00:45.899> and<00:00:46.230> I<00:00:46.950> wish<00:00:47.219> it<00:00:47.399> wasn't<00:00:47.610> there

00:00:47.990 --> 00:00:48.000 
don't play and I wish it wasn't there

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:50.479 
don't play and I wish it wasn't there
because<00:00:48.719> what<00:00:49.079> it<00:00:49.200> does<00:00:49.410> is<00:00:49.620> it<00:00:49.800> encourages

00:00:50.479 --> 00:00:50.489 
because what it does is it encourages

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:51.889 
because what it does is it encourages
people<00:00:50.520> to<00:00:50.820> come<00:00:51.030> up<00:00:51.120> with<00:00:51.239> things<00:00:51.390> they<00:00:51.629> don't

00:00:51.889 --> 00:00:51.899 
people to come up with things they don't

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:55.850 
people to come up with things they don't
like<00:00:52.379> I<00:00:52.710> don't<00:00:52.800> want<00:00:53.160> to<00:00:53.190> hear<00:00:54.620> now<00:00:55.620> if<00:00:55.770> you

00:00:56.840 --> 00:00:56.850 
didn't ask him at all you probably

00:00:56.850 --> 00:00:58.099 
didn't ask him at all you probably
wouldn't<00:00:57.210> have<00:00:57.329> anything<00:00:57.600> in<00:00:57.690> that<00:00:57.750> column

00:00:58.099 --> 00:00:58.109 
wouldn't have anything in that column

00:00:58.109 --> 00:01:00.200 
wouldn't have anything in that column
most<00:00:58.379> of<00:00:58.500> the<00:00:58.559> time<00:00:58.829> having<00:00:59.730> said<00:00:59.910> that<00:00:59.940> there

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:00.210 
most of the time having said that there

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:02.299
