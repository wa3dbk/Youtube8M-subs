00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:34.360 
some of you might not suppose it would

00:01:34.360 --> 00:01:36.210 
some of you might not suppose it would
depend<00:01:34.540> if<00:01:34.720> you've<00:01:34.930> ever<00:01:35.140> had<00:01:35.380> a<00:01:35.440> Gamecube<00:01:35.979> I

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:36.220 
depend if you've ever had a Gamecube I

00:01:36.220 --> 00:01:38.010 
depend if you've ever had a Gamecube I
know<00:01:36.280> they<00:01:36.460> made<00:01:36.640> the<00:01:36.790> second<00:01:37.119> one<00:01:37.210> on<00:01:37.300> D<00:01:37.600> s<00:01:37.750> but

00:01:38.010 --> 00:01:38.020 
know they made the second one on D s but

00:01:38.020 --> 00:01:41.060 
know they made the second one on D s but
I<00:01:38.050> have<00:01:38.290> no<00:01:38.619> idea<00:01:39.130> if<00:01:39.670> it's<00:01:40.000> the<00:01:40.240> same<00:01:40.509> like

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:41.070 
I have no idea if it's the same like

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:43.560 
I have no idea if it's the same like
mansion<00:01:42.070> or<00:01:42.460> whatever<00:01:42.880> or<00:01:43.060> the<00:01:43.119> same<00:01:43.300> layout

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:43.570 
mansion or whatever or the same layout

00:01:43.570 --> 00:01:47.090

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:47.100 
but yeah as you as you can probably see

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:50.690 
but yeah as you as you can probably see

00:01:53.249 --> 00:01:53.259 
the outside is nowhere near done or

00:01:53.259 --> 00:01:54.540 
the outside is nowhere near done or
whatever<00:01:53.440> is<00:01:53.740> because<00:01:53.950> I<00:01:54.009> want<00:01:54.160> to<00:01:54.190> plant<00:01:54.399> it

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:54.550 
whatever is because I want to plant it

whatever is because I want to plant it
I'm<00:01:54.700> planning<00:01:55.060> to<00:01:55.090> do<00:01:55.270> all<00:01:55.450> the<00:01:55.600> inside<00:01:55.960> rooms

00:01:56.249 --> 00:01:56.259 
I'm planning to do all the inside rooms

00:01:56.259 --> 00:01:58.830 
I'm planning to do all the inside rooms
first<00:01:56.590> and<00:01:57.039> then<00:01:57.580> do<00:01:57.850> all<00:01:58.000> the<00:01:58.149> outside<00:01:58.570> will

00:01:58.830 --> 00:01:58.840 
first and then do all the outside will

00:01:58.840 --> 00:02:01.710 
first and then do all the outside will
instead<00:01:59.320> of<00:01:59.940> making<00:02:00.940> all<00:02:01.030> the<00:02:01.149> outside<00:02:01.509> wall

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:01.720 
instead of making all the outside wall

00:02:01.720 --> 00:02:03.330 
instead of making all the outside wall
and<00:02:01.869> then<00:02:01.960> going<00:02:02.200> to<00:02:02.289> do<00:02:02.440> all<00:02:02.560> the<00:02:02.710> rooms<00:02:02.920> and

00:02:03.330 --> 00:02:03.340 
and then going to do all the rooms and

00:02:03.340 --> 00:02:05.490 
and then going to do all the rooms and
then<00:02:03.550> realizing<00:02:04.210> I<00:02:04.509> didn't<00:02:04.869> make<00:02:05.050> it<00:02:05.259> big

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:05.500 
then realizing I didn't make it big

00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:10.259 
then realizing I didn't make it big
enough<00:02:05.740> or<00:02:07.019> it's<00:02:08.019> too<00:02:08.350> big<00:02:08.679> or<00:02:09.070> something<00:02:09.789> and

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:10.269 
enough or it's too big or something and

00:02:10.269 --> 00:02:12.330 
enough or it's too big or something and
in<00:02:10.390> the<00:02:10.479> rooms<00:02:10.690> like<00:02:10.989> every<00:02:11.860> room<00:02:12.040> is<00:02:12.220> like

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:12.340 
in the rooms like every room is like

00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:17.390 
in the rooms like every room is like
this<00:02:12.519> size<00:02:13.120> when<00:02:13.480> there's<00:02:13.660> no<00:02:13.810> need<00:02:13.989> for<00:02:14.019> it

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:17.400 

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:22.229 

go<00:02:18.400> away<00:02:18.640> big<00:02:19.500> so<00:02:20.500> yet<00:02:20.880> another<00:02:21.880> thing<00:02:22.090> about

00:02:22.229 --> 00:02:22.239 
go away big so yet another thing about

00:02:22.239 --> 00:02:25.170 
go away big so yet another thing about
this<00:02:22.600> if<00:02:23.049> I<00:02:23.260> do<00:02:23.320> do<00:02:23.680> this<00:02:23.860> obviously<00:02:24.400> they're

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:25.180 
this if I do do this obviously they're

00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:27.150 
this if I do do this obviously they're
the<00:02:25.209> frames<00:02:25.810> per<00:02:26.110> second<00:02:26.560> might<00:02:26.709> be<00:02:26.890> a<00:02:26.920> little

00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:27.160 
the frames per second might be a little

00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:29.009 
the frames per second might be a little

right for people to watch but sometimes

00:02:40.690 --> 00:02:44.550 
right for people to watch but sometimes
it<00:02:40.840> might<00:02:40.930> go<00:02:41.079> a<00:02:41.110> bit<00:02:41.290> that<00:02:42.180> but<00:02:43.180> it<00:02:43.750> may<00:02:44.380> also

00:02:44.550 --> 00:02:44.560 
it might go a bit that but it may also

00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:47.789 
it might go a bit that but it may also
itself<00:02:45.100> out<00:02:46.170> another<00:02:47.170> thing<00:02:47.350> as<00:02:47.500> well<00:02:47.530> because

00:02:47.789 --> 00:02:47.799 
itself out another thing as well because

00:02:47.799 --> 00:02:50.250 
itself out another thing as well because
my<00:02:48.100> internet<00:02:48.400> speed<00:02:49.000> is<00:02:49.120> so<00:02:49.360> shitty<00:02:49.810> an

00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:50.260 
my internet speed is so shitty an

to<00:02:53.290> nine<00:02:53.350> minutes<00:02:54.690> maybe<00:02:56.070> don't<00:02:57.070> know<00:02:57.160> depends

00:02:57.930 --> 00:02:57.940 
to nine minutes maybe don't know depends

00:02:57.940 --> 00:03:00.630 
to nine minutes maybe don't know depends
I<00:02:58.060> suppose<00:02:58.329> of<00:02:58.959> how<00:02:59.170> much<00:02:59.380> I<00:02:59.680> do<00:02:59.829> in<00:03:00.220> an<00:03:00.340> episode

00:03:00.630 --> 00:03:00.640 
I suppose of how much I do in an episode

00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:04.920 
I suppose of how much I do in an episode
of<00:03:00.790> whatever<00:03:01.380> but<00:03:03.390> yeah<00:03:04.390> so<00:03:04.630> my<00:03:04.750> internet

00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:04.930 
of whatever but yeah so my internet

00:03:04.930 --> 00:03:07.640 
of whatever but yeah so my internet

00:03:07.640 --> 00:03:07.650 
speed is so shitty and if I did like

00:03:07.650 --> 00:03:10.920 
speed is so shitty and if I did like
over<00:03:08.650> like<00:03:08.860> a<00:03:09.100> 10<00:03:09.459> minute<00:03:09.489> episode<00:03:10.209> I'd

00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:10.930

00:03:14.100 --> 00:03:14.110 
probably be looking at a good 3-4 hours

00:03:14.110 --> 00:03:16.860 
probably be looking at a good 3-4 hours
uploading<00:03:14.980> and<00:03:15.370> I<00:03:15.820> don't<00:03:15.910> feel<00:03:16.420> like<00:03:16.630> waiting
