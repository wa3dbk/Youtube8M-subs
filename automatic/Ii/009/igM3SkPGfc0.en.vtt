professional level you know I think I've

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:56.060 
professional level you know I think I've
worked<00:00:54.930> out<00:00:55.050> over<00:00:55.289> the<00:00:55.350> last<00:00:55.500> four<00:00:55.680> years<00:00:55.710> with

00:00:58.819 --> 00:00:58.829 
the Scarlet we've developed a very

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:00.290 
the Scarlet we've developed a very
competitive<00:00:59.280> group<00:00:59.670> of<00:00:59.850> players<00:01:00.030> and

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:00.300 
competitive group of players and

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:04.850 
competitive group of players and
exciting<00:01:00.840> group<00:01:01.140> of<00:01:01.350> young<00:01:02.129> talent<00:01:02.570> and<00:01:03.860> also

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:04.860 
exciting group of young talent and also

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:07.429 
exciting group of young talent and also
we<00:01:05.129> developed<00:01:05.909> an<00:01:06.180> exciting<00:01:06.659> group<00:01:06.900> of<00:01:07.110> young

coaches<00:01:07.860> as<00:01:08.040> well<00:01:08.240> and<00:01:09.240> I<00:01:09.390> think<00:01:09.420> the<00:01:09.990> time<00:01:10.170> is

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:10.200 
coaches as well and I think the time is

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:12.170 
coaches as well and I think the time is
right<00:01:10.350> for<00:01:10.500> them<00:01:10.680> to<00:01:10.860> progress<00:01:11.700> and<00:01:11.909> take<00:01:12.030> the

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:12.180 
right for them to progress and take the

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:13.940 
right for them to progress and take the
next<00:01:12.360> step<00:01:12.630> forward<00:01:13.080> in<00:01:13.200> terms<00:01:13.350> of<00:01:13.560> their<00:01:13.770> own

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:13.950 
next step forward in terms of their own

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:16.609 
next step forward in terms of their own
development<00:01:14.220> like<00:01:15.090> it<00:01:15.240> is<00:01:15.360> for<00:01:15.509> me<00:01:15.659> I<00:01:16.140> think

00:01:16.609 --> 00:01:16.619 
development like it is for me I think

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:20.210 
development like it is for me I think
from<00:01:16.710> a<00:01:16.799> professional<00:01:17.369> level<00:01:18.950> I'd<00:01:19.950> always

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:20.220 
from a professional level I'd always

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:22.580 
from a professional level I'd always
wanted<00:01:20.700> a<00:01:20.759> coach<00:01:21.060> outside<00:01:21.600> of<00:01:21.869> the<00:01:22.290> Scarlet

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:22.590 
wanted a coach outside of the Scarlet

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:24.410 
wanted a coach outside of the Scarlet
environment<00:01:23.250> because<00:01:23.790> i<00:01:23.820> needed<00:01:24.270> to

challenge<00:01:24.750> myself<00:01:24.900> differently<00:01:25.259> and<00:01:26.220> this

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:26.400 
challenge myself differently and this

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:28.880 
challenge myself differently and this
opportunity<00:01:26.659> presents<00:01:27.659> itself<00:01:27.930> and<00:01:28.439> enables

opportunity presents itself and enables

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:32.210 
opportunity presents itself and enables
me<00:01:28.979> to<00:01:29.009> do<00:01:29.280> that<00:01:29.990> but<00:01:30.990> i<00:01:31.020> do<00:01:31.140> feel<00:01:31.439> that<00:01:31.500> I<00:01:31.770> leave

another for Scarlett's probably be

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:42.020

it be in the head coach which which

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:18.550 
it be in the head coach which which
compromise<00:02:16.760> my<00:02:17.120> values<00:02:17.269> but<00:02:17.660> those<00:02:18.140> those

00:02:18.550 --> 00:02:18.560 
compromise my values but those those

00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:20.140 
compromise my values but those those
were<00:02:18.800> the<00:02:19.160> circumstances<00:02:19.340> that<00:02:19.880> we<00:02:19.970> found

00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:20.150 
were the circumstances that we found

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:22.210 
were the circumstances that we found
ourselves<00:02:20.300> from<00:02:21.019> that<00:02:21.080> from<00:02:21.560> that<00:02:21.590> time<00:02:21.920> we've

00:02:22.210 --> 00:02:22.220 
ourselves from that from that time we've

00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:24.729 
ourselves from that from that time we've
built<00:02:22.489> we've<00:02:22.730> got<00:02:23.000> from<00:02:23.180> within<00:02:23.450> we<00:02:24.410> look<00:02:24.620> to

00:02:24.729 --> 00:02:24.739 
built we've got from within we look to

00:02:24.739 --> 00:02:26.559 
built we've got from within we look to
develop<00:02:25.130> our<00:02:25.250> own<00:02:25.280> talent<00:02:25.790> and<00:02:26.090> I<00:02:26.330> think<00:02:26.510> we

00:02:26.559 --> 00:02:26.569 
develop our own talent and I think we

00:02:26.569 --> 00:02:28.090 
develop our own talent and I think we
don't<00:02:26.750> extremely<00:02:27.170> well<00:02:27.319> our<00:02:27.530> performances

00:02:28.090 --> 00:02:28.100 
don't extremely well our performances

00:02:28.100 --> 00:02:30.180 
don't extremely well our performances
have<00:02:28.250> improved<00:02:28.610> our<00:02:28.940> results<00:02:29.690> have<00:02:29.810> improved

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:30.190 
have improved our results have improved

00:02:30.190 --> 00:02:32.559 
have improved our results have improved
I'm<00:02:31.190> where<00:02:31.489> we're<00:02:31.670> at<00:02:31.760> the<00:02:31.910> stage<00:02:32.090> where<00:02:32.150> we

00:02:32.559 --> 00:02:32.569 
I'm where we're at the stage where we

00:02:32.569 --> 00:02:33.970 
I'm where we're at the stage where we
can<00:02:32.690> compete<00:02:32.989> with<00:02:33.200> the<00:02:33.440> best<00:02:33.590> teams<00:02:33.860> in

00:02:41.830 --> 00:02:41.840 
firmly believe that so we were a good

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:44.170 
firmly believe that so we were a good
young<00:02:42.110> group<00:02:42.319> of<00:02:42.440> players<00:02:42.680> we<00:02:42.980> we<00:02:43.910> want<00:02:44.030> to

00:02:44.170 --> 00:02:44.180 
young group of players we we want to

00:02:44.180 --> 00:02:46.449

00:02:49.390 --> 00:02:49.400 
over the coming weeks and months and I

00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:50.620 
over the coming weeks and months and I

00:02:59.500 --> 00:02:59.510 
and I think for my money is one of the

00:02:59.510 --> 00:03:01.599 
and I think for my money is one of the
best<00:02:59.660> technical<00:02:59.989> coaches<00:03:00.440> around<00:03:00.560> so<00:03:01.459> I<00:03:01.519> think

00:03:01.599 --> 00:03:01.609 
best technical coaches around so I think

00:03:01.609 --> 00:03:03.550 
best technical coaches around so I think

00:03:07.300 --> 00:03:07.310 
this decision for me is about my own

00:03:07.310 --> 00:03:10.150

ambition<00:05:17.250> really<00:05:17.669> because<00:05:18.000> we've<00:05:18.180> got<00:05:18.449> that

00:05:19.249 --> 00:05:19.259 
ambition really because we've got that

00:05:19.259 --> 00:05:20.990
