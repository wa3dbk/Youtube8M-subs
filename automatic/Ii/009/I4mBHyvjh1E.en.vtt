00:00:04.650 --> 00:00:08.700
 to see welcome to a new video 

00:00:06.690 --> 00:00:10.650
 set I have something special 

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:12.360
 let's know quite a few factors of the 

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:14.039
 bodybuilding nutrition well of 

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:15.299
 training so that you can give yourself 

00:00:14.039 --> 00:00:20.000
 an improvement of what you are doing 

00:00:15.299 --> 00:00:22.490
 right and wrong and we start with the number one 

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:25.010
 surplus caloric is equal to increase 

00:00:22.490 --> 00:00:27.910
 of weight and also say caloric is 

00:00:25.010 --> 00:00:30.450
 equal to weight loss 

00:00:27.910 --> 00:00:32.310
 the adequacy of calorie intake 

00:00:30.450 --> 00:00:34.870
 macronutrients and micronutrients 

00:00:32.310 --> 00:00:36.790
 determines your health not on behalf of the 

00:00:34.870 --> 00:00:38.829
 meal food equipment and frequency 

00:00:36.790 --> 00:00:41.170
 and every comma 

00:00:38.829 --> 00:00:43.359
 the sufficiency of physical activity more 

00:00:41.170 --> 00:00:45.940
 of macronutrient calorie consumption 

00:00:43.359 --> 00:00:47.320
 and micronutrients determines your health 

00:00:45.940 --> 00:00:50.490
 the name of the food the kind of 

00:00:47.320 --> 00:00:52.710
 food or how often you eat it 

00:00:50.490 --> 00:00:55.160
 the long-term stimuli of the 

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:56.900
 physical activity calorie intake 

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:59.700
 macronutrients and micronutrients 

00:00:56.900 --> 00:01:01.440
 determine their body composition not the 

00:00:59.700 --> 00:01:04.700
 type of food the frequency that the 

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:04.700
 coma is the name of food 

00:01:04.839 --> 00:01:11.409
 sore after your training not 

00:01:07.780 --> 00:01:14.079
 determines if the routine was good or bad 

00:01:11.409 --> 00:01:17.300
 filling your muscle for hours does not determine 

00:01:14.079 --> 00:01:19.310
 if your routine was good or bad 

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:23.200
 the progression of training is what 

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:25.420
 determines whether the exercise was good or not 

00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:27.189
 the only way to stimulate your body 

00:01:25.420 --> 00:01:28.810
 in growth is to increase 

00:01:27.189 --> 00:01:30.640
 continuously stimulating the 

00:01:28.810 --> 00:01:32.079
 loading activity not changing the 

00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:33.930
 Exercises or different actions 

00:01:32.079 --> 00:01:36.630
 things 

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:38.940
 you can grow muscle but not 

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:40.800
 you can give toned muscles 

00:01:38.940 --> 00:01:42.720
 the muscle toning form is 

00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:44.760
 genetics 

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:47.070
 the abdominals are achieved by having 

00:01:44.760 --> 00:01:50.550
 a low body fat content you 

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:52.620
 you know not to do sit-ups 

00:01:50.550 --> 00:01:54.640
 the calorie is a unit to measure the 

00:01:52.620 --> 00:01:56.950
 Energy 

00:01:54.640 --> 00:01:59.810
 the macronutrients are proteins 

00:01:56.950 --> 00:02:02.600
 carbohydrates and fats 

00:01:59.810 --> 00:02:04.780
 the micronutrients are vitamins and 

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:07.210
 the minerals 

00:02:04.780 --> 00:02:10.240
 the anabolic window is a window of 

00:02:07.210 --> 00:02:12.920
 24 or 48 hours not a window of 30 

00:02:10.240 --> 00:02:16.160
 minutes to two hours 

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:17.840
 one gram of protein are 4 calories 1 

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:22.090
 gram of carbohydrates are 4 

00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:22.090
 Calories 1 gram of fat are 9 calories 

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:27.000
 Foods should not be classified 

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:29.340
 and clean or dirty syllables the food 

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:31.440
 then it is clean 

00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:33.420
 the carbohydrates at night do not 

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:36.600
 they make you fat which makes you get fat 

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:38.670
 is to be in a caloric accident 

00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:41.830
 If you can absorb more than 30 grams 

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:45.540
 proteins with a single meal 

00:02:41.830 --> 00:02:48.450
 the protein does not kill your kidneys 

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:51.260
 Fat does not make you fat. 

00:02:48.450 --> 00:02:53.540
 to be in an excellent caloric 

00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:56.000
 you do not have a slow metabolism or 

00:02:53.540 --> 00:02:58.430
 fast me that I know everyone has a 

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:59.780
 metabolic function different which 

00:02:58.430 --> 00:03:02.030
 is determined by a number of 

00:02:59.780 --> 00:03:04.340
 different factors the metabolism does not 

00:03:02.030 --> 00:03:06.620
 should be classified between fast or 

00:03:04.340 --> 00:03:08.569
 Slow high or low should not have 

00:03:06.620 --> 00:03:10.670
 classification in general and you can not 

00:03:08.569 --> 00:03:12.769
 use that as an excuse for not doing 

00:03:10.670 --> 00:03:14.239
 diet or to train different the only thing 

00:03:12.769 --> 00:03:16.590
 what you have to do is consume a few 

00:03:14.239 --> 00:03:19.440
 enough calories 

00:03:16.590 --> 00:03:21.810
 hunger or appetite does not reflect any 

00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:23.760
 type of metabolism in particular the 

00:03:21.810 --> 00:03:25.620
 frequency of feeding the balance 

00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:27.510
 of macronutrients and levels of 

00:03:25.620 --> 00:03:29.790
 hunger and appetite over control of 

00:03:27.510 --> 00:03:32.760
 hormonal functions 

00:03:29.790 --> 00:03:35.099
 we are continuously in both states 

00:03:32.760 --> 00:03:37.840
 catabolic and anabolic and we do not have 

00:03:35.099 --> 00:03:40.150
 no control over that 

00:03:37.840 --> 00:03:41.769
 the increase in the frequency of food 

00:03:40.150 --> 00:03:44.240
 do not alter and have an effect on the 

00:03:41.769 --> 00:03:46.640
 energy balance 

00:03:44.240 --> 00:03:48.290
 the supplements do not complement your diet 

00:03:46.640 --> 00:03:50.120
 and diet do not complement their 

00:03:48.290 --> 00:03:53.450
 supplements 

00:03:50.120 --> 00:03:54.950
 the supplements are not steroids I hope
