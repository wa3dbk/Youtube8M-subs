00:00:12.890 --> 00:00:12.900 
minutes so I kind of got a good feel of

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:14.900 
minutes so I kind of got a good feel of
what<00:00:13.080> it<00:00:13.410> actually<00:00:13.559> feels<00:00:13.799> like<00:00:14.190> to<00:00:14.460> use<00:00:14.759> an

00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:14.910 
what it actually feels like to use an

what it actually feels like to use an
Apple<00:00:15.059> watch<00:00:15.240> so<00:00:15.570> this<00:00:15.990> is<00:00:16.109> my<00:00:16.230> hands-on<00:00:22.609> so<00:00:23.609> I

00:00:25.370 --> 00:00:25.380 
tried both of the versions on and what I

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:27.290 
tried both of the versions on and what I
took<00:00:25.500> away<00:00:25.619> from<00:00:25.800> it<00:00:26.039> was<00:00:26.099> that<00:00:26.430> one<00:00:26.670> the<00:00:26.910> 38

00:00:27.290 --> 00:00:27.300 
took away from it was that one the 38

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:28.730 
took away from it was that one the 38

thicker than anything else that you've

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:41.450 
thicker than anything else that you've
seen<00:00:39.989> in<00:00:40.200> terms<00:00:40.230> of<00:00:40.620> technology<00:00:41.219> on<00:00:41.340> your

pre-ordering was the Space Gray Sport 42
millimeter<00:00:45.780> version<00:00:45.989> and<00:00:46.350> after<00:00:46.530> trying<00:00:46.770> on

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:46.950 
millimeter version and after trying on

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:48.350 
millimeter version and after trying on
all<00:00:47.070> the<00:00:47.190> different<00:00:47.489> kinds<00:00:47.760> I'm<00:00:47.879> pretty<00:00:48.180> happy

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:48.360 
all the different kinds I'm pretty happy

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:50.180 
all the different kinds I'm pretty happy
with<00:00:48.539> that<00:00:48.600> decision<00:00:48.870> I<00:00:49.410> wanted<00:00:49.920> to<00:00:49.980> get<00:00:50.100> the

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:50.190 
with that decision I wanted to get the

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:51.740 
with that decision I wanted to get the
Apple<00:00:50.430> watch<00:00:50.520> originally<00:00:51.180> the<00:00:51.300> stainless

00:00:51.740 --> 00:00:51.750 
Apple watch originally the stainless

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:53.360 
Apple watch originally the stainless
steel<00:00:51.960> one<00:00:52.170> but<00:00:52.379> it's<00:00:52.739> just<00:00:52.829> a<00:00:52.949> little<00:00:53.070> bit<00:00:53.280> too

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:53.370 
steel one but it's just a little bit too

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:54.979 
steel one but it's just a little bit too
expensive<00:00:53.610> and<00:00:54.059> I<00:00:54.239> figured<00:00:54.539> that<00:00:54.570> I'll<00:00:54.840> be

00:00:54.979 --> 00:00:54.989 
expensive and I figured that I'll be

00:00:54.989 --> 00:00:56.930 
expensive and I figured that I'll be
perfectly<00:00:55.289> happy<00:00:55.620> with<00:00:56.039> the<00:00:56.309> Space<00:00:56.670> Gray

00:00:56.930 --> 00:00:56.940 
perfectly happy with the Space Gray

00:00:56.940 --> 00:00:58.970 
perfectly happy with the Space Gray
sport<00:00:57.329> model<00:00:57.600> and<00:00:57.780> after<00:00:57.989> dining<00:00:58.199> on<00:00:58.410> it's

00:00:58.970 --> 00:00:58.980 
sport model and after dining on it's

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:00.770 
sport model and after dining on it's
really<00:00:59.250> the<00:00:59.460> best<00:00:59.850> decision<00:01:00.300> for<00:01:00.329> me<00:01:00.629> at<00:01:00.750> least

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:00.780 
really the best decision for me at least

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:02.420 
really the best decision for me at least
so<00:01:01.530> enough<00:01:01.739> with<00:01:01.770> all<00:01:02.039> that<00:01:02.160> other<00:01:02.309> stuff

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:02.430 
so enough with all that other stuff

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:03.709 
so enough with all that other stuff
let's<00:01:02.850> talk<00:01:02.940> about<00:01:03.059> what<00:01:03.270> it's<00:01:03.359> actually<00:01:03.480> like

00:01:03.709 --> 00:01:03.719 
let's talk about what it's actually like

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:05.060 
let's talk about what it's actually like
to<00:01:03.930> use<00:01:04.229> coz<00:01:04.470> that's<00:01:04.559> really<00:01:04.830> the<00:01:04.920> big

00:01:05.060 --> 00:01:05.070 
to use coz that's really the big

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:06.920 
to use coz that's really the big
question<00:01:05.100> now<00:01:05.939> of<00:01:05.970> course<00:01:06.240> this<00:01:06.450> was<00:01:06.630> just<00:01:06.840> in

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:06.930 
question now of course this was just in

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:08.240 
question now of course this was just in
the<00:01:07.020> store<00:01:07.080> and<00:01:07.530> I<00:01:07.560> couldn't<00:01:07.770> really<00:01:07.890> do<00:01:08.100> that

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:08.250 
the store and I couldn't really do that

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:09.740 
the store and I couldn't really do that
much<00:01:08.460> with<00:01:08.670> it<00:01:08.850> because<00:01:08.970> it's<00:01:09.240> an<00:01:09.330> historic

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:09.750 
much with it because it's an historic

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:12.230 
much with it because it's an historic
demo<00:01:09.990> mode<00:01:10.229> the<00:01:11.070> ones<00:01:11.430> that<00:01:11.549> I<00:01:11.640> use<00:01:11.850> you<00:01:11.880> can<00:01:12.150> do

00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:12.240 
demo mode the ones that I use you can do

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:13.730 
demo mode the ones that I use you can do
pretty<00:01:12.360> much<00:01:12.510> everything<00:01:12.869> with<00:01:13.140> it<00:01:13.290> but<00:01:13.470> since

00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:13.740 
pretty much everything with it but since

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:15.440 
pretty much everything with it but since
it's<00:01:13.890> not<00:01:13.979> connected<00:01:14.430> to<00:01:14.460> a<00:01:14.549> phone<00:01:14.820> it<00:01:15.299> can

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:15.450 
it's not connected to a phone it can

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:17.030 
it's not connected to a phone it can
only<00:01:15.570> do<00:01:15.780> so<00:01:16.049> much<00:01:16.259> and<00:01:16.470> there's<00:01:16.650> not<00:01:16.740> all<00:01:16.950> the

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:17.040 
only do so much and there's not all the

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:18.350 
only do so much and there's not all the
different<00:01:17.310> apps<00:01:17.460> that<00:01:17.640> you<00:01:17.729> can<00:01:17.759> download<00:01:17.970> and

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:18.360 
different apps that you can download and

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:20.149 
different apps that you can download and
stuff<00:01:18.570> like<00:01:18.689> that<00:01:18.869> so<00:01:19.110> I<00:01:19.320> just<00:01:19.710> got<00:01:19.860> to<00:01:19.890> get<00:01:20.100> a

00:01:20.149 --> 00:01:20.159 
stuff like that so I just got to get a

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:22.130 
stuff like that so I just got to get a
feel<00:01:20.490> for<00:01:20.729> the<00:01:20.820> user<00:01:21.000> interface<00:01:21.270> and<00:01:21.900> how<00:01:21.990> it

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:22.140 
feel for the user interface and how it

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:23.630 
feel for the user interface and how it
works<00:01:22.350> rather<00:01:22.680> than<00:01:22.950> actually<00:01:23.400> how<00:01:23.520> it's

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:23.640 
works rather than actually how it's

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:25.370 
works rather than actually how it's
gonna<00:01:23.700> work<00:01:23.939> in<00:01:24.060> my<00:01:24.119> everyday<00:01:24.360> life<00:01:24.600> but<00:01:24.930> once

00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:25.380 
gonna work in my everyday life but once

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:27.109 
gonna work in my everyday life but once
I<00:01:25.500> get<00:01:25.560> the<00:01:25.830> Apple<00:01:26.189> watch<00:01:26.280> in<00:01:26.460> here<00:01:26.640> studio

00:01:27.109 --> 00:01:27.119 
I get the Apple watch in here studio

00:01:27.119 --> 00:01:28.670 
I get the Apple watch in here studio
then<00:01:27.360> we're<00:01:27.479> gonna<00:01:27.600> actually<00:01:27.810> test<00:01:28.500> it<00:01:28.560> out

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:28.680 
then we're gonna actually test it out

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:30.200 
then we're gonna actually test it out
fully<00:01:28.979> and<00:01:29.189> see<00:01:29.400> how<00:01:29.490> it<00:01:29.579> works<00:01:29.729> in<00:01:29.820> everyday

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:30.210 
fully and see how it works in everyday

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:32.120 
fully and see how it works in everyday
life<00:01:30.420> but<00:01:30.780> actually<00:01:31.140> using<00:01:31.560> the<00:01:31.710> Apple<00:01:32.009> watch

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:32.130 
life but actually using the Apple watch

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:34.789 
life but actually using the Apple watch
is<00:01:32.490> a<00:01:32.579> pretty<00:01:32.820> decent<00:01:33.090> experience<00:01:33.659> I<00:01:34.079> was<00:01:34.500> kind

00:01:34.789 --> 00:01:34.799 
is a pretty decent experience I was kind

00:01:34.799 --> 00:01:36.499 
is a pretty decent experience I was kind
of<00:01:34.860> mixed<00:01:35.189> emotions<00:01:35.369> on<00:01:35.970> the<00:01:36.180> user<00:01:36.390> interface

00:01:36.499 --> 00:01:36.509 
of mixed emotions on the user interface

00:01:36.509 --> 00:01:38.179 
of mixed emotions on the user interface
it<00:01:37.079> just<00:01:37.259> seemed<00:01:37.470> a<00:01:37.619> little<00:01:37.829> bit<00:01:37.950> cluttered

00:01:38.179 --> 00:01:38.189 
it just seemed a little bit cluttered

00:01:38.189 --> 00:01:41.060 
it just seemed a little bit cluttered
and<00:01:38.520> not<00:01:38.759> not<00:01:39.390> well<00:01:40.079> thought<00:01:40.380> out<00:01:40.409> but<00:01:40.829> after

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:41.070 
and not not well thought out but after

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:42.980 
and not not well thought out but after
using<00:01:41.490> it<00:01:41.759> it<00:01:41.880> actually<00:01:42.030> does<00:01:42.450> make<00:01:42.630> sense<00:01:42.810> for

00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:42.990 
using it it actually does make sense for

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:44.480 
using it it actually does make sense for
the<00:01:43.079> most<00:01:43.259> part<00:01:43.500> as<00:01:43.649> long<00:01:44.070> as<00:01:44.189> you<00:01:44.250> get<00:01:44.340> the

00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:44.490 
the most part as long as you get the

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:46.069 
the most part as long as you get the
different<00:01:44.759> gestures<00:01:45.119> down<00:01:45.360> like<00:01:45.570> force<00:01:45.840> touch

00:01:46.069 --> 00:01:46.079 
different gestures down like force touch

00:01:46.079 --> 00:01:47.899 
different gestures down like force touch
and<00:01:46.470> swiping<00:01:46.829> and<00:01:46.979> using<00:01:47.250> the<00:01:47.340> digital<00:01:47.729> crown

00:01:47.899 --> 00:01:47.909 
and swiping and using the digital crown

00:01:47.909 --> 00:01:49.999 
and swiping and using the digital crown
if<00:01:48.450> you<00:01:48.630> can<00:01:48.750> get<00:01:48.869> all<00:01:48.990> those<00:01:49.140> things<00:01:49.200> down<00:01:49.770> and

00:01:49.999 --> 00:01:50.009 
if you can get all those things down and

00:01:50.009 --> 00:01:51.170 
if you can get all those things down and
you<00:01:50.070> like<00:01:50.250> know<00:01:50.399> that<00:01:50.579> those<00:01:50.729> are<00:01:50.880> something

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:51.180 
you like know that those are something

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:52.550 
you like know that those are something
you<00:01:51.270> have<00:01:51.299> to<00:01:51.420> do<00:01:51.630> and<00:01:51.869> it<00:01:51.960> actually<00:01:52.140> really

00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:52.560 
you have to do and it actually really

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:54.109 
you have to do and it actually really
isn't<00:01:52.710> that<00:01:52.829> hard<00:01:53.100> to<00:01:53.220> use<00:01:53.340> the<00:01:53.700> Apple<00:01:53.970> watch

00:01:54.109 --> 00:01:54.119 
isn't that hard to use the Apple watch

00:01:54.119 --> 00:01:55.670 
isn't that hard to use the Apple watch
one<00:01:54.659> thing<00:01:54.780> I<00:01:54.869> did<00:01:55.020> notice<00:01:55.140> is<00:01:55.350> that<00:01:55.409> there's

00:01:55.670 --> 00:01:55.680 
one thing I did notice is that there's

00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:57.410 
one thing I did notice is that there's
just<00:01:55.799> a<00:01:55.979> ton<00:01:56.219> of<00:01:56.250> stuff<00:01:56.640> that<00:01:56.790> you<00:01:56.909> can<00:01:56.939> do<00:01:57.270> on

00:01:57.410 --> 00:01:57.420 
just a ton of stuff that you can do on

00:01:57.420 --> 00:01:58.999 
just a ton of stuff that you can do on
here<00:01:57.659> compared<00:01:58.110> to<00:01:58.140> every<00:01:58.439> other<00:01:58.469> SmartWatch

00:01:58.999 --> 00:01:59.009 
here compared to every other SmartWatch

00:01:59.009 --> 00:02:00.560 
here compared to every other SmartWatch
out<00:01:59.159> there<00:01:59.369> it<00:01:59.549> really<00:01:59.579> kind<00:02:00.180> of<00:02:00.240> blows<00:02:00.420> them

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:00.570 
out there it really kind of blows them

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:01.910 
out there it really kind of blows them
out<00:02:00.600> of<00:02:00.750> the<00:02:00.810> water<00:02:00.960> in<00:02:01.110> terms<00:02:01.229> of<00:02:01.439> stuff<00:02:01.740> that

00:02:01.910 --> 00:02:01.920 
out of the water in terms of stuff that

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:03.950 
out of the water in terms of stuff that
you<00:02:02.009> can<00:02:02.040> do<00:02:02.460> now<00:02:03.210> whether<00:02:03.600> or<00:02:03.659> not<00:02:03.780> that's

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:03.960 
you can do now whether or not that's

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:05.749 
you can do now whether or not that's
useful<00:02:04.469> or<00:02:04.590> not<00:02:04.710> I<00:02:04.950> don't<00:02:05.159> know<00:02:05.280> that's<00:02:05.490> up<00:02:05.640> to

00:02:05.749 --> 00:02:05.759 
useful or not I don't know that's up to

00:02:05.759 --> 00:02:07.550 
useful or not I don't know that's up to
you<00:02:05.880> but<00:02:06.210> if<00:02:06.509> you<00:02:06.899> want<00:02:07.110> to<00:02:07.200> do<00:02:07.320> those<00:02:07.530> things

00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:07.560 
you but if you want to do those things

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:08.839 
you but if you want to do those things
and<00:02:07.890> you<00:02:08.009> want<00:02:08.160> the<00:02:08.250> most<00:02:08.429> out<00:02:08.670> of<00:02:08.729> a

00:02:08.839 --> 00:02:08.849 
and you want the most out of a

00:02:08.849 --> 00:02:10.219 
and you want the most out of a
SmartWatch<00:02:09.209> this<00:02:09.479> seems<00:02:09.690> like<00:02:09.750> the<00:02:09.959> one<00:02:10.110> to

00:02:10.219 --> 00:02:10.229 
SmartWatch this seems like the one to

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:12.050 
SmartWatch this seems like the one to
get<00:02:10.440> the<00:02:10.860> digital<00:02:11.190> crown<00:02:11.340> works<00:02:11.640> extremely

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:12.060 
get the digital crown works extremely

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:13.290 
get the digital crown works extremely
well<00:02:12.330> for<00:02:12.510> scrolling

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:13.300 
well for scrolling

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:14.640 
well for scrolling
zooming<00:02:13.660> I<00:02:13.810> don't<00:02:14.080> know<00:02:14.140> why<00:02:14.260> you<00:02:14.320> want<00:02:14.560> to

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:14.650 
zooming I don't know why you want to

00:02:14.650 --> 00:02:16.200 
zooming I don't know why you want to
zoom<00:02:14.680> you<00:02:15.070> can<00:02:15.160> zoom<00:02:15.430> into<00:02:15.580> a<00:02:15.640> map<00:02:15.910> and<00:02:16.090> your

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:16.210 
zoom you can zoom into a map and your

00:02:16.210 --> 00:02:17.880 
zoom you can zoom into a map and your
photos<00:02:16.540> and<00:02:16.630> stuff<00:02:16.840> like<00:02:17.020> that<00:02:17.200> I<00:02:17.410> don't<00:02:17.770> want

00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:17.890 
photos and stuff like that I don't want

00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:19.260 
photos and stuff like that I don't want
to<00:02:17.950> be<00:02:18.010> looking<00:02:18.190> at<00:02:18.340> photos<00:02:18.610> on<00:02:18.730> my<00:02:18.760> wrist<00:02:19.030> but

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:19.270 
to be looking at photos on my wrist but

00:02:19.270 --> 00:02:21.510 
to be looking at photos on my wrist but
if<00:02:19.600> you<00:02:19.750> do<00:02:19.960> I<00:02:19.990> guess<00:02:20.320> you<00:02:20.440> can<00:02:20.710> but<00:02:21.010> for

00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:21.520 
if you do I guess you can but for

00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:22.860 
if you do I guess you can but for
scrolling<00:02:21.910> and<00:02:22.060> stuff<00:02:22.240> the<00:02:22.390> digital<00:02:22.720> crown

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:22.870 
scrolling and stuff the digital crown

00:02:22.870 --> 00:02:24.660 
scrolling and stuff the digital crown
works<00:02:23.140> extremely<00:02:23.440> well<00:02:23.680> it's<00:02:23.980> so<00:02:24.160> smooth<00:02:24.520> it's

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:24.670 
works extremely well it's so smooth it's

00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:27.030 
works extremely well it's so smooth it's
it's<00:02:25.270> like<00:02:25.390> it's<00:02:25.630> in<00:02:25.960> like<00:02:26.200> oil<00:02:26.440> or<00:02:26.710> something

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:27.040 
it's like it's in like oil or something

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:28.620 
it's like it's in like oil or something
it's<00:02:27.160> really<00:02:27.370> hard<00:02:27.520> to<00:02:27.580> explain<00:02:27.820> but<00:02:28.090> so

00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:28.630 
it's really hard to explain but so

00:02:28.630 --> 00:02:30.570 
it's really hard to explain but so
smooth<00:02:28.900> works<00:02:29.170> exactly<00:02:29.500> the<00:02:29.740> way<00:02:29.920> you<00:02:29.980> move<00:02:30.430> it

00:02:30.570 --> 00:02:30.580 
smooth works exactly the way you move it

00:02:30.580 --> 00:02:32.310 
smooth works exactly the way you move it
so<00:02:30.610> if<00:02:30.880> you<00:02:30.970> stop<00:02:31.270> it<00:02:31.480> stops<00:02:31.780> perfectly

00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:32.320 
so if you stop it stops perfectly

00:02:32.320 --> 00:02:33.630 
so if you stop it stops perfectly
there's<00:02:32.500> no<00:02:32.620> like<00:02:32.770> lag<00:02:33.010> or<00:02:33.220> anything<00:02:33.400> like

00:02:33.630 --> 00:02:33.640 
there's no like lag or anything like

00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:35.760 
there's no like lag or anything like
that<00:02:33.700> works<00:02:34.330> really<00:02:34.540> well<00:02:34.660> screen<00:02:35.560> looks

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:35.770 
that works really well screen looks

00:02:35.770 --> 00:02:37.830 
that works really well screen looks
pretty<00:02:36.040> good<00:02:36.250> it's<00:02:36.520> an<00:02:36.640> OLED<00:02:36.970> screen<00:02:37.390> so<00:02:37.690> that

00:02:37.830 --> 00:02:37.840 
pretty good it's an OLED screen so that

00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:39.780 
pretty good it's an OLED screen so that
means<00:02:38.050> it's<00:02:38.290> gonna<00:02:38.440> be<00:02:38.560> really<00:02:39.070> dark<00:02:39.370> blacks

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:39.790 
means it's gonna be really dark blacks

00:02:39.790 --> 00:02:41.460 
means it's gonna be really dark blacks
and<00:02:40.120> have<00:02:40.540> some<00:02:40.690> pretty<00:02:40.840> bride<00:02:41.050> from<00:02:41.140> colors

00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:42.700 
and it looks really good at least in

00:02:42.700 --> 00:02:44.520 
and it looks really good at least in
this<00:02:42.820> store<00:02:43.180> now<00:02:43.690> people<00:02:44.020> were<00:02:44.110> saying<00:02:44.380> that

00:02:44.520 --> 00:02:44.530 
this store now people were saying that

00:02:44.530 --> 00:02:45.720 
this store now people were saying that
there<00:02:44.650> was<00:02:44.740> a<00:02:44.770> bit<00:02:44.950> of<00:02:45.040> an<00:02:45.130> air<00:02:45.310> gap<00:02:45.490> because

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:45.730 
there was a bit of an air gap because

00:02:45.730 --> 00:02:47.490 
there was a bit of an air gap because
it's<00:02:45.850> not<00:02:46.000> a<00:02:46.030> laminated<00:02:46.630> screen<00:02:46.900> and<00:02:47.110> I<00:02:47.170> really

00:02:47.490 --> 00:02:47.500 
it's not a laminated screen and I really

00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:49.260 
it's not a laminated screen and I really
looked<00:02:47.740> for<00:02:47.920> that<00:02:47.980> I<00:02:48.040> like<00:02:48.340> held<00:02:48.850> it<00:02:48.940> up<00:02:49.060> and

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:49.270 
looked for that I like held it up and

00:02:49.270 --> 00:02:51.090 
looked for that I like held it up and
like<00:02:49.360> looked<00:02:49.600> for<00:02:49.780> a<00:02:49.810> gap<00:02:49.990> and<00:02:50.230> inside<00:02:50.950> the

00:02:51.090 --> 00:02:51.100 
like looked for a gap and inside the

00:02:51.100 --> 00:02:52.620 
like looked for a gap and inside the
store<00:02:51.310> I<00:02:51.340> couldn't<00:02:51.760> see<00:02:51.940> it<00:02:52.030> but<00:02:52.300> if<00:02:52.450> you<00:02:52.540> go

00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:52.630 
store I couldn't see it but if you go

00:02:52.630 --> 00:02:54.180 
store I couldn't see it but if you go
outside<00:02:52.780> I'm<00:02:53.080> sure<00:02:53.230> it'll<00:02:53.380> be<00:02:53.470> more<00:02:53.920> apparent

00:02:54.180 --> 00:02:54.190 
outside I'm sure it'll be more apparent

00:02:54.190 --> 00:02:56.040 
outside I'm sure it'll be more apparent
but<00:02:54.700> for<00:02:54.910> the<00:02:54.970> size<00:02:55.180> of<00:02:55.300> the<00:02:55.420> screen<00:02:55.780> it's

00:02:56.040 --> 00:02:56.050 
but for the size of the screen it's

00:02:56.050 --> 00:02:58.320 
but for the size of the screen it's
really<00:02:56.260> not<00:02:56.590> that<00:02:56.650> noticeable<00:02:57.280> I<00:02:57.850> didn't<00:02:58.150> see

00:02:58.320 --> 00:02:58.330 
really not that noticeable I didn't see

00:02:58.330 --> 00:02:59.970 
really not that noticeable I didn't see
at<00:02:58.540> least<00:02:58.660> in<00:02:58.840> the<00:02:58.960> store<00:02:59.260> now<00:02:59.740> I've<00:02:59.830> played

00:02:59.970 --> 00:02:59.980 
at least in the store now I've played

00:02:59.980 --> 00:03:01.500 
at least in the store now I've played
around<00:03:00.130> with<00:03:00.490> the<00:03:00.640> glances<00:03:01.210> and<00:03:01.420> the

00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:01.510 
around with the glances and the

00:03:01.510 --> 00:03:03.360 
around with the glances and the
notifications<00:03:02.320> and<00:03:02.530> felt<00:03:02.830> how<00:03:02.980> it<00:03:03.070> feels<00:03:03.280> on

00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:03.370 
notifications and felt how it feels on

00:03:03.370 --> 00:03:05.070 
notifications and felt how it feels on
your<00:03:03.430> wrist<00:03:03.760> and<00:03:03.970> how<00:03:04.270> you<00:03:04.330> contact<00:03:04.870> people

00:03:05.070 --> 00:03:05.080 
your wrist and how you contact people

00:03:05.080 --> 00:03:07.320 
your wrist and how you contact people

00:03:07.320 --> 00:03:07.330 
and it's interesting there's a lot of

00:03:07.330 --> 00:03:09.300 
and it's interesting there's a lot of
stuff<00:03:07.570> that<00:03:07.690> you<00:03:07.810> can<00:03:07.990> do<00:03:08.170> here<00:03:08.470> and<00:03:08.620> it's<00:03:09.100> one

00:03:09.300 --> 00:03:09.310 
stuff that you can do here and it's one

00:03:09.310 --> 00:03:10.650 
stuff that you can do here and it's one
of<00:03:09.400> those<00:03:09.520> things<00:03:09.790> like<00:03:10.000> like<00:03:10.270> I<00:03:10.360> said<00:03:10.510> before

00:03:10.650 --> 00:03:10.660 
of those things like like I said before

00:03:10.660 --> 00:03:12.090 
of those things like like I said before

you have to really use it in your
everyday<00:03:12.190> life<00:03:12.550> to<00:03:12.820> see<00:03:12.970> what<00:03:13.150> its<00:03:13.270> gonna<00:03:13.330> be

00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:13.450 
everyday life to see what its gonna be

00:03:13.450 --> 00:03:15.420 
everyday life to see what its gonna be

00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:15.430 
like I really don't know yet one other

00:03:15.430 --> 00:03:16.830 
like I really don't know yet one other
thing<00:03:15.670> I<00:03:15.730> really<00:03:16.000> liked<00:03:16.180> about<00:03:16.300> it<00:03:16.450> was<00:03:16.570> the

00:03:16.830 --> 00:03:16.840 
thing I really liked about it was the

00:03:16.840 --> 00:03:18.900 
thing I really liked about it was the
haptic<00:03:17.230> feedback<00:03:17.260> when<00:03:17.950> it<00:03:18.040> buzzes<00:03:18.580> on<00:03:18.760> your

00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:18.910 
haptic feedback when it buzzes on your

00:03:18.910 --> 00:03:20.880 
haptic feedback when it buzzes on your
wrist<00:03:19.180> it<00:03:19.390> doesn't<00:03:19.630> feel<00:03:19.810> like<00:03:19.870> a<00:03:20.080> buzz<00:03:20.590> like

00:03:20.880 --> 00:03:20.890 
wrist it doesn't feel like a buzz like

00:03:20.890 --> 00:03:22.290 
wrist it doesn't feel like a buzz like
something<00:03:21.310> like<00:03:21.459> this<00:03:21.489> does<00:03:21.910> where<00:03:22.090> you<00:03:22.180> can

00:03:22.290 --> 00:03:22.300 
something like this does where you can

00:03:22.300 --> 00:03:23.910 
something like this does where you can
audibly<00:03:22.690> hear<00:03:22.930> it<00:03:23.020> you<00:03:23.410> don't<00:03:23.560> hear<00:03:23.709> anything

00:03:23.910 --> 00:03:23.920 
audibly hear it you don't hear anything

00:03:23.920 --> 00:03:25.440 
audibly hear it you don't hear anything
but<00:03:24.160> you<00:03:24.250> just<00:03:24.400> feel<00:03:24.640> it<00:03:24.670> kind<00:03:25.120> of<00:03:25.239> feels<00:03:25.390> like

00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:25.450 
but you just feel it kind of feels like

00:03:25.450 --> 00:03:26.880 
but you just feel it kind of feels like
everything's<00:03:25.780> going<00:03:25.930> like<00:03:26.080> boom<00:03:26.350> boom<00:03:26.380> like

00:03:26.880 --> 00:03:26.890 
everything's going like boom boom like

00:03:26.890 --> 00:03:29.280 
everything's going like boom boom like
onto<00:03:27.670> your<00:03:27.820> wrist<00:03:27.970> it's<00:03:28.600> hard<00:03:28.750> to<00:03:28.840> explain<00:03:29.050> it

00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:29.290 
onto your wrist it's hard to explain it

00:03:29.290 --> 00:03:30.510 
onto your wrist it's hard to explain it
doesn't<00:03:29.530> feel<00:03:29.620> like<00:03:29.800> normal<00:03:29.950> haptic<00:03:30.459> feedback

00:03:30.510 --> 00:03:30.520 
doesn't feel like normal haptic feedback

00:03:30.520 --> 00:03:32.400 
doesn't feel like normal haptic feedback
it's<00:03:31.000> not<00:03:31.090> just<00:03:31.270> a<00:03:31.330> vibration<00:03:31.870> it<00:03:31.989> feels<00:03:32.200> like

00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:32.410 
it's not just a vibration it feels like

00:03:32.410 --> 00:03:34.890 
it's not just a vibration it feels like
pressure<00:03:32.830> it's<00:03:33.730> weird<00:03:33.970> but<00:03:34.209> it's<00:03:34.270> really<00:03:34.690> cool

00:03:34.890 --> 00:03:34.900 
pressure it's weird but it's really cool

00:03:34.900 --> 00:03:36.930 
pressure it's weird but it's really cool
and<00:03:35.170> actually<00:03:35.650> makes<00:03:35.860> those<00:03:36.160> buzzes<00:03:36.580> less

00:03:36.930 --> 00:03:36.940 
and actually makes those buzzes less

00:03:36.940 --> 00:03:38.850 
and actually makes those buzzes less
less<00:03:37.720> annoying<00:03:38.080> because<00:03:38.380> you<00:03:38.470> don't<00:03:38.620> hear

00:03:38.850 --> 00:03:38.860 
less annoying because you don't hear

00:03:38.860 --> 00:03:40.020 
less annoying because you don't hear
them<00:03:39.010> but<00:03:39.190> you<00:03:39.250> kind<00:03:39.459> of<00:03:39.489> feel<00:03:39.670> them<00:03:39.820> so<00:03:39.970> you

00:03:40.020 --> 00:03:40.030 
them but you kind of feel them so you

00:03:40.030 --> 00:03:41.760 
them but you kind of feel them so you
know<00:03:40.150> you've<00:03:40.300> got<00:03:40.420> something<00:03:40.690> but<00:03:41.050> it's<00:03:41.530> not

00:03:41.760 --> 00:03:41.770 
know you've got something but it's not

00:03:41.770 --> 00:03:43.560 
know you've got something but it's not
like<00:03:41.980> audible<00:03:42.550> and<00:03:42.730> like<00:03:42.910> everyone<00:03:43.270> knows<00:03:43.420> you

00:03:43.560 --> 00:03:43.570 
like audible and like everyone knows you

00:03:43.570 --> 00:03:45.390 
like audible and like everyone knows you
got<00:03:43.690> a<00:03:43.720> notification<00:03:44.020> it's<00:03:44.830> much<00:03:45.040> more<00:03:45.190> subtle

00:03:45.390 --> 00:03:45.400 
got a notification it's much more subtle

00:03:45.400 --> 00:03:47.040 
got a notification it's much more subtle
than<00:03:45.640> that<00:03:45.700> one<00:03:46.300> thing<00:03:46.450> I<00:03:46.510> was<00:03:46.630> really<00:03:46.660> worried

00:03:47.040 --> 00:03:47.050 
than that one thing I was really worried

00:03:47.050 --> 00:03:48.300 
than that one thing I was really worried
about<00:03:47.110> was<00:03:47.440> whether<00:03:47.590> or<00:03:47.680> not<00:03:47.770> the<00:03:47.950> screen<00:03:48.160> was

00:03:48.300 --> 00:03:48.310 
about was whether or not the screen was

00:03:48.310 --> 00:03:50.370 
about was whether or not the screen was
gonna<00:03:48.430> be<00:03:48.610> too<00:03:48.760> small<00:03:49.030> to<00:03:49.180> tap<00:03:49.420> and<00:03:49.690> that<00:03:50.170> you

00:03:50.370 --> 00:03:50.380 
gonna be too small to tap and that you

00:03:50.380 --> 00:03:51.600 
gonna be too small to tap and that you
would<00:03:50.500> go<00:03:50.620> to<00:03:50.650> tap<00:03:50.950> something<00:03:51.220> and<00:03:51.430> you<00:03:51.489> would

00:03:51.600 --> 00:03:51.610 
would go to tap something and you would

00:04:11.280 --> 00:04:11.290 
that if you have bigger fingers in mine

00:04:11.290 --> 00:04:12.540 
that if you have bigger fingers in mine
mine<00:04:11.500> are<00:04:11.590> pretty<00:04:11.860> big<00:04:12.070> but<00:04:12.100> if<00:04:12.370> you<00:04:12.459> have

mine are pretty big but if you have
bigger<00:04:12.760> fingers<00:04:13.150> and<00:04:13.420> it<00:04:13.690> might<00:04:13.840> be<00:04:13.959> a<00:04:13.989> little

00:04:14.220 --> 00:04:14.230 
bigger fingers and it might be a little

00:04:14.230 --> 00:04:16.710 
bigger fingers and it might be a little
bit<00:04:14.350> of<00:04:14.440> an<00:04:14.530> issue<00:04:14.620> but<00:04:15.040> it<00:04:15.640> wasn't<00:04:16.030> as<00:04:16.180> big<00:04:16.510> of

00:04:16.710 --> 00:04:16.720 
bit of an issue but it wasn't as big of

00:04:16.720 --> 00:04:18.330 
bit of an issue but it wasn't as big of
a<00:04:16.900> problem<00:04:16.930> as<00:04:17.590> I<00:04:17.680> thought<00:04:17.799> I<00:04:17.859> was<00:04:18.010> gonna<00:04:18.100> be

00:04:18.330 --> 00:04:18.340 
a problem as I thought I was gonna be

00:04:18.340 --> 00:04:19.860 
a problem as I thought I was gonna be
now<00:04:18.760> of<00:04:18.850> course<00:04:19.090> I<00:04:19.180> didn't<00:04:19.390> get<00:04:19.480> to<00:04:19.570> test<00:04:19.750> the

00:04:19.860 --> 00:04:19.870 
now of course I didn't get to test the

00:04:19.870 --> 00:04:21.210 
now of course I didn't get to test the
battery<00:04:20.019> life<00:04:20.410> or<00:04:20.440> what<00:04:20.739> it's<00:04:20.859> like<00:04:20.950> when<00:04:21.100> it's

00:04:21.210 --> 00:04:21.220 
battery life or what it's like when it's

00:04:21.220 --> 00:04:22.440 
battery life or what it's like when it's
connected<00:04:21.430> to<00:04:21.700> a<00:04:21.729> phone<00:04:22.030> but<00:04:22.300> that's

00:04:22.440 --> 00:04:22.450 
connected to a phone but that's

00:04:22.450 --> 00:04:23.940 
connected to a phone but that's
definitely<00:04:22.930> gonna<00:04:23.020> be<00:04:23.110> coming<00:04:23.470> once<00:04:23.620> I<00:04:23.710> get<00:04:23.860> it

00:04:23.940 --> 00:04:23.950

00:04:25.800 --> 00:04:25.810 
in in a few weeks and overall my

00:04:25.810 --> 00:04:27.129 
in in a few weeks and overall my
impressions<00:04:26.260> are<00:04:26.410> that<00:04:26.440> it's

00:04:27.129 --> 00:04:27.139 
impressions are that it's

00:04:27.139 --> 00:04:28.270 
impressions are that it's
than<00:04:27.349> I<00:04:27.469> thought<00:04:27.620> it<00:04:27.740> was<00:04:27.830> gonna<00:04:28.009> be

00:04:28.270 --> 00:04:28.280 
than I thought it was gonna be

00:04:28.280 --> 00:04:29.830 
than I thought it was gonna be
