00:00:01.250 --> 00:00:07.330
 Hello everyone today on the channel is very 

00:00:04.700 --> 00:00:11.900
 interesting knife actually 

00:00:07.330 --> 00:00:15.080
 which was made like this super 

00:00:11.900 --> 00:00:16.700
 sturdy super versatile knife 

00:00:15.080 --> 00:00:22.850
 let's say and call it so for 

00:00:16.700 --> 00:00:25.779
 bushcraft, which means it's great as always 

00:00:22.850 --> 00:00:27.920
 the scabbard and suspension here is not 

00:00:25.779 --> 00:00:29.420
 free for one simple reason you 

00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:33.380
 you can because that loop is enough 

00:00:29.420 --> 00:00:36.910
 This small knife was considered for 

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:40.129
 carrying it on a backpack 

00:00:36.910 --> 00:00:42.370
 on the bag but not the belt that 

00:00:40.129 --> 00:00:46.629
 big enough and has such 

00:00:42.370 --> 00:00:50.719
 quite a lot of weight in my opinion 

00:00:46.629 --> 00:00:53.800
 let's get the knife need not yet 

00:00:50.719 --> 00:00:57.829
 got used therefore apologize means 

00:00:53.800 --> 00:00:59.660
 Here is such an interesting shape knife can 

00:00:57.829 --> 00:01:02.359
 be someone immediately pays attention to 

00:00:59.660 --> 00:01:06.380
 the finish of the blade and it seems to someone that 

00:01:02.359 --> 00:01:09.920
 quickie and flaw it really 

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:14.960
 not so the fact that the blade is made 

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:17.780
 Steel P18 it is here in this far-he 

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:21.710
 up the gray shank further on the wine bolt 

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:26.630
 and in fact I have not yet met 

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:30.079
 nothing more complicated processing than here 

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:33.860
 this faith is 18 on polishing this knife 

00:01:30.079 --> 00:01:36.799
 it was spent here a huge amount 

00:01:33.860 --> 00:01:40.390
 time to achieve some kind of well 

00:01:36.799 --> 00:01:44.479
 most such sateen or something at the same time 

00:01:40.390 --> 00:01:46.399
 here you see the camera is reflected but 

00:01:44.479 --> 00:01:49.700
 herewith, the risks are still all 

00:01:46.399 --> 00:01:53.990
 peep who can be turned 

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:57.439
 attention that the knife is sharpened let's say 

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:59.840
 not sharpened lowered into the lens since 

00:01:57.439 --> 00:02:03.640
 here we have in the butt with you 6 millimeters 

00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:06.760
 that is, the very r18 then 

00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:08.709
 I wanted to get such a knife 

00:02:06.760 --> 00:02:11.860
 condition so that he cut well well 

00:02:08.709 --> 00:02:15.850
 chopped to be able to give less 

00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:19.300
 some high loads in order to 

00:02:15.850 --> 00:02:23.250
 avoid frequent editing and chipping 

00:02:19.300 --> 00:02:28.750
 edges because steel is very hard 

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:33.970
 here went the cutter from the machine on which 

00:02:28.750 --> 00:02:35.459
 cut in my drill bits for 

00:02:33.970 --> 00:02:38.650
 drilling land 

00:02:35.459 --> 00:02:40.540
 that means but here we have reduced 

00:02:38.650 --> 00:02:44.019
 at about 07 

00:02:40.540 --> 00:02:47.410
 but further the lens lens is basically on 

00:02:44.019 --> 00:02:50.110
 all over start on top well and 

00:02:47.410 --> 00:02:52.570
 the greatest part here here is now to 

00:02:50.110 --> 00:02:54.370
 hem well here I think even see 

00:02:52.570 --> 00:02:57.160
 such a band from where 

00:02:54.370 --> 00:02:58.920
 the lens greatly increases means 

00:02:57.160 --> 00:03:02.400
 present with us climbed 

00:02:58.920 --> 00:03:04.860
 Here is such a brass here 

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:08.590
 bolster with mother 

00:03:04.860 --> 00:03:13.120
 through brass spacer red fiber 

00:03:08.590 --> 00:03:15.489
 black fiber brass slice of ironwood 

00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:18.329
 which station from the past knife and 

00:03:15.489 --> 00:03:23.019
 it means on the handle we have with you 

00:03:18.329 --> 00:03:25.530
 apricot so beautiful apricot turned out 

00:03:23.019 --> 00:03:28.269
 Here is such an interesting shape of the handle 

00:03:25.530 --> 00:03:30.040
 the knife was conceived because as such 

00:03:28.269 --> 00:03:33.579
 super working super universal 

00:03:30.040 --> 00:03:37.630
 the tool then the handle is made so not 

00:03:33.579 --> 00:03:40.440
 just really here in this 

00:03:37.630 --> 00:03:43.329
 the position is very convenient to work with a knife 

00:03:40.440 --> 00:03:47.370
 it means that this protrusion falls exactly 

00:03:43.329 --> 00:03:51.010
 between two fingers and there is a possibility 

00:03:47.370 --> 00:03:53.950
 knife grip here so here is the type for 

00:03:51.010 --> 00:03:55.930
 let's say for chopping up to be so 

00:03:53.950 --> 00:03:59.650
 more convenient because after all u click 

00:03:55.930 --> 00:04:02.800
 heaviness on the wedge that allows you 

00:03:59.650 --> 00:04:07.210
 it’s convenient to take this with two fingers 

00:04:02.800 --> 00:04:09.610
 ledge plus one here and one so here 

00:04:07.210 --> 00:04:12.130
 top on this glue you can quite 

00:04:09.610 --> 00:04:15.130
 comfortably chop it done for 

00:04:12.130 --> 00:04:17.530
 extra convenience handle shape 

00:04:15.130 --> 00:04:20.470
 This is not an accident I wanted to try 

00:04:17.530 --> 00:04:22.450
 something new and let's say it here 

00:04:20.470 --> 00:04:24.790
 installation since the pass through here was 

00:04:22.450 --> 00:04:28.830
 made the nut and the nut is closed like this 

00:04:24.790 --> 00:04:32.500
 here still unfortunately not oxidized 

00:04:28.830 --> 00:04:34.690
 the muse was clean pin was taken plate 

00:04:32.500 --> 00:04:36.490
 copper aluminum plate were 

00:04:34.690 --> 00:04:38.710
 overthrown here and so in the sausage 

00:04:36.490 --> 00:04:40.630
 inserted here you see more 

00:04:38.710 --> 00:04:43.060
 a little bit a little bit to polished 

00:04:40.630 --> 00:04:47.620
 it's leftovers and pack nets there literally 

00:04:43.060 --> 00:04:50.110
 I'll finish there today and with time 

00:04:47.620 --> 00:04:53.110
 when this is this place will oxidize 

00:04:50.110 --> 00:04:56.410
 there will be a clearer picture so here 

00:04:53.110 --> 00:04:59.050
 so here's an interesting knife let's last name 

00:04:56.410 --> 00:05:02.260
 his blade because I no longer remember in 

00:04:59.050 --> 00:05:04.780
 manufacturing process because the drawing 

00:05:02.260 --> 00:05:06.850
 initially this one but in fact when 

00:05:04.780 --> 00:05:09.340
 you get a product there something 

00:05:06.850 --> 00:05:13.690
 have to finish remodel means 

00:05:09.340 --> 00:05:17.200
 the handle we have 12 7 centimeters wedge 

00:05:13.690 --> 00:05:19.390
 we have with you 12 half centimeters well 

00:05:17.200 --> 00:05:24.970
 and as I told you in the butt we have 6 

00:05:19.390 --> 00:05:29.050
 millimeters of steel er-6f confidence r18 

00:05:24.970 --> 00:05:33.730
 such a hell of a 100 manhole in which 17 

00:05:29.050 --> 00:05:36.850
 percent 17-18 percent tungsten then 

00:05:33.730 --> 00:05:39.570
 very wear-resistant piece of iron which is under 

00:05:36.850 --> 00:05:42.790
 force is very much not only gender 

00:05:39.570 --> 00:05:45.040
 cut to load cork around 

00:05:42.790 --> 00:05:47.500
 the rest means shoes a little bit 

00:05:45.040 --> 00:05:50.200
 released before letting go of fate 

00:05:47.500 --> 00:05:53.030
 and so this part as I usually do 

00:05:50.200 --> 00:05:55.670
 done that 

00:05:53.030 --> 00:05:57.440
 Butt checked on the bank to 

00:05:55.670 --> 00:06:00.530
 understand the hardness is clear that she and so 

00:05:57.440 --> 00:06:03.940
 high jar he just nibbles 

00:06:00.530 --> 00:06:07.150
 a glass pickled cucumber so what 

00:06:03.940 --> 00:06:09.950
 hardness is very high but at the same time 

00:06:07.150 --> 00:06:13.690
 the lens still gives protection against a fool 

00:06:09.950 --> 00:06:17.870
 protection from staining except but again 

00:06:13.690 --> 00:06:22.730
 the result will show all the same poyus knife very 

00:06:17.870 --> 00:06:24.920
 interesting and here such sheath need 

00:06:22.730 --> 00:06:27.170
 still new therefore ours has not yet wiped and 

00:06:24.920 --> 00:06:28.520
 again as I said carrying 

00:06:27.170 --> 00:06:31.340
 This knife is considered 

00:06:28.520 --> 00:06:34.490
 only on the bag or on 

00:06:31.340 --> 00:06:38.420
 something here's another job 

00:06:34.490 --> 00:06:41.660
 Here is such a powerful handsome on what he 

00:06:38.420 --> 00:06:45.470
 It seems difficult to say well, what is 

00:06:41.660 --> 00:06:47.870
 such of trees of a dance climbed on 

00:06:45.470 --> 00:06:51.320
 fallkniven and here is much bigger 

00:06:47.870 --> 00:06:54.860
 sizes here so maybe someone 

00:06:51.320 --> 00:06:57.020
 tell me how you could remove here 

00:06:54.860 --> 00:07:00.230
 this one then but no matter how much I tried 

00:06:57.020 --> 00:07:02.450
 it didn’t happen though 

00:07:00.230 --> 00:07:05.510
 in a hurry and work in 7 sandpaper 

00:07:02.450 --> 00:07:09.710
 polish polishing and the risks do not clean in 

00:07:05.510 --> 00:07:11.870
 principle, therefore, here is such a beast 

00:07:09.710 --> 00:07:14.510
 which is very good now cuts very 

00:07:11.870 --> 00:07:16.610
 well for sure it is clear that this is not 

00:07:14.510 --> 00:07:17.870
 a food knife that can be an apple 

00:07:16.610 --> 00:07:19.400
 peel potatoes 

00:07:17.870 --> 00:07:22.340
 it is clear that in extreme conditions 

00:07:19.400 --> 00:07:27.440
 can it be but more knife was calculated 

00:07:22.340 --> 00:07:30.230
 as such a household finishing knife 

00:07:27.440 --> 00:07:32.810
 which can cats touch her tree 

00:07:30.230 --> 00:07:35.750
 cut down a little for the new year like this 

00:07:32.810 --> 00:07:37.430
 Here is quite the crash husband of Tyr 

00:07:35.750 --> 00:07:39.770
 here's an interesting knife would be interesting 

00:07:37.430 --> 00:07:42.340
 know your opinion on this all thanks 

00:07:39.770 --> 00:07:42.340
 until
