00:00:59.539 --> 00:00:59.549 
any particularly high tech it's not a

00:00:59.549 --> 00:01:00.859 
any particularly high tech it's not a
particular<00:00:59.940> expensive<00:01:00.390> something<00:01:00.720> like<00:01:00.839> a

00:01:00.859 --> 00:01:00.869 
particular expensive something like a

00:01:00.869 --> 00:01:02.329 
particular expensive something like a
phone<00:01:01.110> it<00:01:01.229> happens<00:01:01.500> to<00:01:01.619> be<00:01:01.650> a<00:01:01.769> very<00:01:01.949> injure<00:01:02.220> as

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:08.460 
exercise here and that is being fed

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:11.630 
exercise here and that is being fed
through<00:01:08.659> this<00:01:09.659> audio<00:01:10.170> device<00:01:10.619> which<00:01:11.220> is<00:01:11.580> a

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:11.640 
through this audio device which is a

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:14.779 
through this audio device which is a
blue<00:01:12.240> icicle<00:01:12.590> pick<00:01:13.590> that<00:01:13.710> up<00:01:13.770> for<00:01:14.189> about<00:01:14.399> 50

00:01:14.779 --> 00:01:14.789 
blue icicle pick that up for about 50

00:01:14.789 --> 00:01:18.050 
blue icicle pick that up for about 50
pounds<00:01:14.939> whatever<00:01:15.299> that<00:01:15.539> is<00:01:15.659> 60<00:01:15.990> 70<00:01:16.350> dollars<00:01:17.060> so

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:18.060 
pounds whatever that is 60 70 dollars so

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:19.880 
pounds whatever that is 60 70 dollars so
again<00:01:18.329> nothing<00:01:18.840> particularly<00:01:19.229> special<00:01:19.380> but

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:19.890 
again nothing particularly special but

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:21.919 
again nothing particularly special but
perfectly<00:01:20.549> competent<00:01:20.880> for<00:01:21.149> what<00:01:21.270> we<00:01:21.390> want<00:01:21.630> and

00:01:21.919 --> 00:01:21.929 
perfectly competent for what we want and

00:01:21.929 --> 00:01:23.899 
perfectly competent for what we want and
that's<00:01:22.409> going<00:01:22.590> to<00:01:22.679> go<00:01:22.799> into<00:01:23.039> my<00:01:23.189> own<00:01:23.310> bun<00:01:23.490> 2<00:01:23.670> box

00:01:23.899 --> 00:01:23.909 
that's going to go into my own bun 2 box

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:25.810 
that's going to go into my own bun 2 box
which<00:01:24.479> I'm<00:01:24.689> going<00:01:24.840> to<00:01:24.990> record<00:01:25.320> the<00:01:25.619> audio

00:01:25.810 --> 00:01:25.820 
which I'm going to record the audio

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:28.370 
which I'm going to record the audio
produced<00:01:26.820> by<00:01:26.969> these<00:01:27.179> speakers<00:01:27.600> and<00:01:27.780> then<00:01:28.170> what

00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:28.380 
produced by these speakers and then what

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:31.219 
produced by these speakers and then what
we<00:01:28.499> can<00:01:28.649> do<00:01:28.829> is<00:01:29.249> compare<00:01:29.820> that<00:01:30.119> to<00:01:30.479> the<00:01:30.869> audio

00:01:31.219 --> 00:01:31.229 
we can do is compare that to the audio

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:34.399 
we can do is compare that to the audio
that's<00:01:31.799> heard<00:01:32.100> by<00:01:32.909> these<00:01:33.119> headphones<00:01:33.409> okay

00:01:34.399 --> 00:01:34.409 
that's heard by these headphones okay

00:01:34.409 --> 00:01:38.179 
that's heard by these headphones okay
and<00:01:34.619> then<00:01:35.070> we'll<00:01:35.280> have<00:01:35.549> a<00:01:36.229> comparison<00:01:37.229> of<00:01:37.439> the

00:01:38.179 --> 00:01:38.189 
and then we'll have a comparison of the

00:01:38.189 --> 00:01:40.609 
and then we'll have a comparison of the
difference<00:01:38.700> between<00:01:39.600> that<00:01:39.810> which<00:01:40.200> I<00:01:40.409> think

00:01:40.609 --> 00:01:40.619 
difference between that which I think

00:01:40.619 --> 00:01:44.989 
difference between that which I think
you'll<00:01:40.770> find<00:01:41.009> is<00:01:41.729> substantial<00:01:42.719> so<00:01:43.609> to<00:01:44.609> start

00:01:44.989 --> 00:01:44.999 
you'll find is substantial so to start

00:01:44.999 --> 00:01:48.289 
you'll find is substantial so to start
off<00:01:45.210> with<00:01:45.479> let's<00:01:46.140> have<00:01:46.409> a<00:01:46.439> look<00:01:46.770> at<00:01:47.039> the<00:01:47.789> sound

00:01:48.289 --> 00:01:48.299 
off with let's have a look at the sound

00:01:48.299 --> 00:01:54.080 
off with let's have a look at the sound
from<00:01:49.020> the<00:01:49.229> speakers

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:54.090

and<00:02:54.169> now<00:02:54.439> we<00:02:55.040> can<00:02:55.459> listen<00:02:55.879> to<00:02:56.150> the<00:02:56.810> recording

00:02:57.640 --> 00:02:57.650 
and now we can listen to the recording

00:02:57.650 --> 00:03:00.729 
and now we can listen to the recording
using<00:02:58.310> these<00:02:59.060> earphones<00:02:59.480> so<00:03:00.230> what<00:03:00.530> I'm<00:03:00.620> going

00:03:00.739 --> 00:03:03.189 
using these earphones so what I'm going
to<00:03:00.799> do<00:03:00.980> to<00:03:01.370> mimic<00:03:02.060> the<00:03:02.329> effect<00:03:02.659> of<00:03:02.900> the

00:03:03.189 --> 00:03:03.199 
to do to mimic the effect of the

00:03:03.199 --> 00:03:06.280 
to do to mimic the effect of the
softness<00:03:03.769> of<00:03:03.919> the<00:03:03.980> human<00:03:04.370> head<00:03:04.549> is<00:03:05.109> I<00:03:06.109> won't
