 You can teach how to bathe the dog. 

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:15.570
 teaching how to use a dog is accurate 

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:17.820
 be a subject that you master very much 

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:20.460
 because as long as you start your 

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:22.950
 channel on youtube you will need you 

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:23.549
 will be continuously working on this 

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:25.830
 channel 

00:01:23.549 --> 00:01:27.540
 so if it's a theme you do not like 

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:29.790
 What are you doing only for 

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:31.740
 money will come a time when you 

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:33.689
 It will stop because you will not have more. 

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:35.369
 ideas you will not have more subject in 

00:01:33.689 --> 00:01:37.110
 Your channel will end up dying. 

00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:39.180
 there are people who make videos 

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:41.670
 teaching how to make-up 

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:44.490
 there are even children that parents 

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:46.530
 help making joking videos 

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:49.200

 It's playing with carts. I own it. 

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:53.909
 many videos are some of the most 

00:01:51.479 --> 00:01:56.460
 viewed from my youtube channel 

00:01:53.909 --> 00:01:57.800
 It's a dollhouse that I made with 

00:01:56.460 --> 00:02:00.110
 recycled material 

00:01:57.800 --> 00:02:02.690
 my daughter some videos my daughter me 

00:02:00.110 --> 00:02:04.910
 helped to make these materials 

00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:07.010
 kitchen furniture is really the public 

00:02:04.910 --> 00:02:10.340
 is an audience that is there 

00:02:07.010 --> 00:02:12.860
 dominating the internet and not all technology 

00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:17.060
 another way to earn money through 

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:19.580
 of youtube are with the publishes editorials 

00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:22.640
 What is this are the paid products 

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:25.520
 when you get paid to talk about some 

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:28.610
 product on your channel, let's assume that a 

00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:31.760
 company sent you is a product for you 

00:02:28.610 --> 00:02:34.280
 try to evaluate and count for 

00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:36.950
 your audience what you think of that 

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:39.830
 product and is called publieditorial 

00:02:36.950 --> 00:02:42.170
 company will pay you an amount on the outside and 

00:02:39.830 --> 00:02:44.810
 besides you can still win with the 

00:02:42.170 --> 00:02:46.670
 views of your videos on youtube 

00:02:44.810 --> 00:02:49.370
 thinking of course it's very important 

00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:50.900
 be as honest as possible 

00:02:49.370 --> 00:02:53.450
 every time you work for a 

00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:56.060
 company or make an editorial bo 

00:02:53.450 --> 00:02:58.730
 Important for you to inform your audience 

00:02:56.060 --> 00:03:01.550
 what is it that is a video that is being 

00:02:58.730 --> 00:03:04.070
 sponsored by someone you are 

00:03:01.550 --> 00:03:06.590
 being paid to speak that for more 

00:03:04.070 --> 00:03:08.420
 that is your honest opinion but it is 

00:03:06.590 --> 00:03:10.370
 important for your audience to know why 

00:03:08.420 --> 00:03:13.160
 they trust you anyway 

00:03:10.370 --> 00:03:15.709
 they trust in their word the third 

00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:17.930
 way it is a very efficient way is 

00:03:15.709 --> 00:03:21.170
 you advertise your own product 

00:03:17.930 --> 00:03:23.860
 so suppose you have a pet 

00:03:21.170 --> 00:03:26.180
 You shop and you did some video on youtube. 

00:03:23.860 --> 00:03:28.310
 Teaching how to take care of your dog 

00:03:26.180 --> 00:03:30.350
 how to give a nice bath in your dog 

00:03:28.310 --> 00:03:33.590
 You can already in the video description 

00:03:30.350 --> 00:03:35.060
 leave the contact of your pet shop if you 

00:03:33.590 --> 00:03:37.459
 have a website 

00:03:35.060 --> 00:03:39.980
 you leave the link you can leave your 

00:03:37.459 --> 00:03:40.880

00:03:39.980 --> 00:03:42.950
 calls 

00:03:40.880 --> 00:03:45.620
 so everything is a way for you to generate 

00:03:42.950 --> 00:03:48.590
 more income for your life for your 

00:03:45.620 --> 00:03:51.050
 business if you have a company that 

00:03:48.590 --> 00:03:54.350
 the party, for example, you can 

00:03:51.050 --> 00:03:57.170
 explain how to decorate a mass with 

00:03:54.350 --> 00:03:59.330
 balloons something like something that 

00:03:57.170 --> 00:04:01.580
 would you make a party and not 

00:03:59.330 --> 00:04:04.010
 they are the contact cds for people 

00:04:01.580 --> 00:04:06.680
 that call people to hire 

00:04:04.010 --> 00:04:08.840
 the service then in addition to you profit from 

00:04:06.680 --> 00:04:10.790
 to see that video suppose 

00:04:08.840 --> 00:04:11.570
 that you taught how to make a flower 

00:04:10.790 --> 00:04:14.630
 balloon 

00:04:11.570 --> 00:04:16.489
 you will still profit from customers who 

00:04:14.630 --> 00:04:18.440
 you will acquire and thus generate more 

00:04:16.489 --> 00:04:19.489
 core generate more revenue for your 

00:04:18.440 --> 00:04:21.620
 company 

00:04:19.489 --> 00:04:24.890
 if you are a psychologist you can approach 

00:04:21.620 --> 00:04:28.100

 talk in the video that people can 

00:04:32.480 --> 00:04:35.570
 to discount 

00:04:33.680 --> 00:04:38.540
 if you are a realtor you 

00:04:35.570 --> 00:04:41.180
