00:00:05.129 --> 00:00:11.560
 29 and the ex bt two beings crowns 

00:00:09.490 --> 00:00:13.000
 humans and the mayor rosalie pareil 

00:00:11.560 --> 00:00:15.040
 like the old models either 

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:18.099
 any convoy the elite sty 

00:00:15.040 --> 00:00:20.320
 ltd of your models are just as strong 

00:00:18.099 --> 00:00:22.599
 it's all the same on the mechanical side 

00:00:20.320 --> 00:00:24.189
 mechanics is very well done to say 

00:00:22.599 --> 00:00:25.599
 it's not dull surfaces that's how 

00:00:24.189 --> 00:00:27.519
 him who would be parent aging the one 

00:00:25.599 --> 00:00:31.179
 which flesh out if your antennas are 

00:00:27.519 --> 00:00:33.100
 defective and protected that you do not

 have a new model wants 

00:00:33.100 --> 00:00:37.510
 new digital moder store because 

00:00:34.900 --> 00:00:41.350
 that kobo they make digital models 

00:00:37.510 --> 00:00:42.640
 for a little competition from the 

00:00:41.350 --> 00:00:44.530
 companies because the others 

00:00:42.640 --> 00:00:46.180
 companies do not hurt of digital fact 

00:00:44.530 --> 00:00:49.830
 some noise still picked the stick 

00:00:46.180 --> 00:00:52.540
 because like the other xmas model x 

00:00:49.830 --> 00:00:55.660
 the same bti in the bottom you have 

00:00:52.540 --> 00:00:57.550
 a whole I repeat everything to their 

00:00:55.660 --> 00:00:58.720
 netizens banker that you need to 

00:00:57.550 --> 00:01:01.470
 light a bone in the corner 

00:00:58.720 --> 00:01:04.720
 and then you yes everything is with the srfc 

00:01:01.470 --> 00:01:07.060
 heavy time c2mi lots the same thing 

00:01:04.720 --> 00:01:08.770
 what does the rest marries a real 

00:01:07.060 --> 00:01:10.000
 if you place your money they go 

00:01:08.770 --> 00:01:11.740
 you indicate if they wanted to place 

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:13.080
 time he wanted 0 you have cannes 

00:01:11.740 --> 00:01:15.550
 you have the weather 

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:17.260
 and then you have channel 9 and then the 

00:01:15.550 --> 00:01:21.040
 denmark 1 that it is too strong you 

00:01:17.260 --> 00:01:23.200
 can say that the dovecotes reut 

00:01:21.040 --> 00:01:24.729
 it's the October 7 adaptation of 

00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:25.380
 frequencies that do not know my skin from 

00:01:24.729 --> 00:01:28.060
 need 

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:30.310
 the world his dumb skin right at 

00:01:28.060 --> 00:01:34.720
 left 70 consultants in the direction and 

00:01:30.310 --> 00:01:36.220
 to stay if this one right channel that 

00:01:34.720 --> 00:01:38.500
 does more or less the channel on the 

00:01:36.220 --> 00:01:40.870
 fixed frequency inhabitants who is a little 

00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:42.310
 ambiguous to which as usual you have 

00:01:40.870 --> 00:01:44.890
 your wooden sailboat squared everything 

00:01:42.310 --> 00:01:47.350
 will arrange and then move your 

00:01:44.890 --> 00:01:49.479
 mistake that denies everything depends on air and if 

00:01:47.350 --> 00:01:51.970
 you have your check mark all dependent 

00:01:49.479 --> 00:01:54.590
 your noise level when someone 

00:01:51.970 --> 00:01:56.780
 you have some noise it's about 

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:59.840
 you sink your sink until time 

00:01:56.780 --> 00:02:03.649
 that they are about 1 and then your 

00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:06.079
 squash at noon noon the squared web years 

00:02:03.649 --> 00:02:07.310
 to the arts and then when your eye 

00:02:06.079 --> 00:02:09.530
 it's about 11 o'clock they're going 

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:12.470
 pay a contradiction the signal to send 

00:02:09.530 --> 00:02:15.500
 your first dan hamhuis and the voice 

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:18.260
 functional pick up the same microphone the 

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:20.890
 northern micro you have your option 

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:24.110
 bluetooth saw back on it 

00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:26.299
 the regrets I made the tension there 

00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:29.180
 will stay the sw 1 and as I already 

00:02:26.299 --> 00:02:33.890
 explained you calibrated you will weigh 

00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:38.299
 on calibration you climb your check mark 

00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:39.739
 in also with 70 until they 

00:02:38.299 --> 00:02:45.140
 be at most 

00:02:39.739 --> 00:02:47.120
 and then after you put sw that it takes 

00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:51.140
 not that it goes up must not put it down 

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:52.849
 a five point 21.5 it stops 

00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:55.220
 a point without you are going to have a meal 

00:02:52.849 --> 00:02:58.129
 your American calculation does not make 

00:02:55.220 --> 00:03:00.980
 part is at least 5 km from zahlé de 

00:02:58.129 --> 00:03:04.400
 lanza royère 2km too rotten would have 

00:03:00.980 --> 00:03:06.260
 not even a kilometer the sw rails the 

00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:10.579
 most beautiful possible when you are in 

00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:13.519
 swr mode after finally if you put them in 

00:03:10.579 --> 00:03:17.269
 at srfc why power but when 

00:03:13.519 --> 00:03:20.510
 you put a sw not that it goes up 

00:03:17.269 --> 00:03:22.489
 there is also this mark is passed 

00:03:20.510 --> 00:03:25.250
 this one marks you warning it was 

00:03:22.489 --> 00:03:27.440
 check your antenna is a problem 

00:03:25.250 --> 00:03:29.690
 the other python as I showed on 

00:03:27.440 --> 00:03:31.760
 the elite this is the jail bac access rate 

00:03:29.690 --> 00:03:32.930
 someone you do not go up do you hear 

00:03:31.760 --> 00:03:35.150
 talk will stop 

00:03:32.930 --> 00:03:37.040
 you hear about a civilian by the 

00:03:35.150 --> 00:03:41.109
 piton turn back pack what is 

00:03:37.040 --> 00:03:41.109
 important do you hear yourself from clicking 

00:03:41.650 --> 00:03:45.650
 programming for their little name 

00:03:44.299 --> 00:03:47.060
 to let you poke your eyes in 

00:03:45.650 --> 00:03:49.099
 your beautiful little book the man is by

 example to go into the mode 

00:03:49.099 --> 00:03:52.790
 bluetooth what is more important 

00:03:50.420 --> 00:03:57.439
 because it's annoying it's a 

00:03:52.790 --> 00:04:01.790
 lotto and then you weigh on the menu you 

00:03:57.439 --> 00:04:05.090
 are you going to have the weather that you can 

00:04:01.790 --> 00:04:07.970
 put alert or remove it nicolas where

 you are red and yellow green 

00:04:07.970 --> 00:04:14.780
 give people also show the net this 

00:04:10.700 --> 00:04:17.509
 if the intensity of the sinn haiti if the red 

00:04:14.780 --> 00:04:20.289
 hot chip no one lifts it all up 

00:04:17.509 --> 00:04:23.210
 have suffered self and then you put yourself 

00:04:20.289 --> 00:04:26.259
 not to borgo you do not put back to 

00:04:23.210 --> 00:04:29.030
 focal is rather be hockey 

00:04:26.259 --> 00:04:33.259
 in very clear blue tooth you put the 

00:04:29.030 --> 00:04:37.280
 hike else must go out there to there 

00:04:33.259 --> 00:04:39.919

 for your phone you have to 

00:05:16.460 --> 00:05:21.949
 set according to the dock welcomes

 some elephants in Morocco 's 

00:05:25.880 --> 00:05:28.840
 phone was marked 

00:05:29.390 --> 00:05:32.600
 that I'm going to wait for him to finish 

00:05:30.980 --> 00:05:37.490
 to look for that's what's long a 

00:05:32.600 --> 00:05:39.350
 little one group that goes together buried 

00:05:37.490 --> 00:05:42.740
 directly like that the yi comes back into 

00:05:39.350 --> 00:05:45.140
 fashion since they what eye and pretends that 

00:05:42.740 --> 00:05:49.610
 the phone I leave aside 

00:05:45.140 --> 00:05:52.160
 and then I take a house phone 

00:05:49.610 --> 00:05:53.690
 and then I see called on my phone 

00:05:52.160 --> 00:05:56.080
 cell to see what does it 

00:05:53.690 --> 00:05:56.080
 will display 

00:06:05.390 --> 00:06:09.760
 should appear on the display 

00:06:12.370 --> 00:06:16.970
 clearly that the French and then I 

00:06:14.930 --> 00:06:23.900
 read also you only in English because 

00:06:16.970 --> 00:06:26.870

 spread rumors in blue pech 

00:06:26.870 --> 00:06:32.420
 and then it's like the ones we can 

00:06:28.910 --> 00:06:34.970
 talk and then if we killed that volume 

00:06:32.420 --> 00:06:40.610
 here of road slipping if I speak 

00:06:34.970 --> 00:06:43.940
 with us so the meaning of the phone's 

00:06:40.610 --> 00:06:45.680
 your friend comes out of a speaker followed you 

00:06:43.940 --> 00:06:48.110
 when you speak you do not need 

00:06:45.680 --> 00:06:49.580
 safety you pay no wish it 

00:06:48.110 --> 00:06:51.200
 you're in phone mode talking to you 

00:06:49.580 --> 00:06:54.080
 just a little hole here you talk about the

 not good ben is a little micro fiv or 

00:06:59.630 --> 00:07:07.130
 branches at the back so far up 

00:07:04.670 --> 00:07:08.540
 so far to you that plug in the title 

00:07:07.130 --> 00:07:11.960
 conquered in british hippie your 

00:07:08.540 --> 00:07:14.270
 micro sensitivity and and 4.5 times more 

00:07:11.960 --> 00:07:16.240
 at long distance while it is 

00:07:14.270 --> 00:07:19.130
 short distance 

00:07:16.240 --> 00:07:24.580
 and as another purchase and government 

00:07:19.130 --> 00:07:26.810
 forbade us cell phones 

00:07:24.580 --> 00:07:28.460
 microphones he was part of some 

00:07:26.810 --> 00:07:30.740
 if it is, but today it is 

00:07:28.460 --> 00:07:33.260
 that we can use a microphone 

00:07:30.740 --> 00:07:34.790
 we have the right because they too have 

00:07:33.260 --> 00:07:38.120
 decided canada who had taken a 

00:07:34.790 --> 00:07:39.980
 landed with lucie beam is heavy there 

00:07:38.120 --> 00:07:41.210
 calculate skin that there are a lot more 

00:07:39.980 --> 00:07:42.800
 that will open because they 

00:07:41.210 --> 00:07:44.060

 high st micro yann python taxes la 

00:07:52.070 --> 00:07:55.400
 end that it is not the vexing that we have 

00:07:53.420 --> 00:07:58.250
 disturbed the pickups we can talk on
