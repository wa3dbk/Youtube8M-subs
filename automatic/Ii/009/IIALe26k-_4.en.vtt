 from a gameplay I will put the 

00:00:43.339 --> 00:00:48.680
 gameplay in one description but before 

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:50.900
 everything so I continue I tell you 

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:53.659

00:00:58.400 --> 00:01:02.299
 say it right now huh but it's 

00:01:00.019 --> 00:01:04.699
 it's a little gameplay there it's a 

00:01:02.299 --> 00:01:05.860
 quick little gameplay of about two 

00:01:04.699 --> 00:01:09.110
 minutes 

00:01:05.860 --> 00:01:10.759
 yes here and frankly if you want 

00:01:09.110 --> 00:01:13.460
 not see images or anything 

00:01:10.759 --> 00:01:15.080
 frankly I'm worthy I tell you to leave 

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:17.479
 the video right now it's just for 

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:19.159
 you a loan if you who see you 

00:01:17.479 --> 00:01:20.409
 take the risk you pass it's 

00:01:19.159 --> 00:01:23.540
 frankly it's you who see 

00:01:20.409 --> 00:01:25.759
 good then we'll start the first 

00:01:23.540 --> 00:01:28.400
 picture so well yeah so I'm going to do 

00:01:25.759 --> 00:01:30.470
 pictures I'm portraying I'm not going to put 

00:01:28.400 --> 00:01:32.090
 the video why because I hold my 

00:01:30.470 --> 00:01:34.790
 chain and it may be a copyright 

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:37.100
 and where in fact these are not 

00:01:34.790 --> 00:01:39.110
 real pictures I do not think of course 

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:40.460
 it's for the video that's his own act 

00:01:39.110 --> 00:01:42.560
 machines are removed but in fact 

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:43.909
 if they are good but I never know 

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:46.909
 do not even know if I'm entitled to mativi 

00:01:43.909 --> 00:01:49.370
 these images we'll see it's my video 

00:01:46.909 --> 00:01:53.270
 are deleted from that is I 

00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:55.640
 hope not at all finally short so there 

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:58.040
 we are in the early hours already the player he 

00:01:55.640 --> 00:01:59.990
 choose what difficulty he wants he has 

00:01:58.040 --> 00:02:02.600
 put the original he can start at the 

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:05.150
 first leg he put the box 

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:07.909
 magic the magic boot then remove it 

00:02:05.150 --> 00:02:09.679
 how to say in the east is hot 

00:02:07.909 --> 00:02:13.549
 only then will he make a gain of 

00:02:09.679 --> 00:02:16.069
 level 8 is the map greene raine and he 

00:02:13.549 --> 00:02:18.140
 going to be in the tarn section and that's 

00:02:16.069 --> 00:02:20.060
 the very last section actually sort 

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:22.310
 years open called he will play in mode 

00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:25.370
 survival which is the name the normal mode 

00:02:22.310 --> 00:02:27.459
 so next pictures of a balloon at the 

00:02:25.370 --> 00:02:29.599
 page of changes what does it look like 

00:02:27.459 --> 00:02:30.799
 that's what it had to be what it 

00:02:29.599 --> 00:02:33.110
 looked like before the zombies 

00:02:30.799 --> 00:02:35.640
 actually come 

00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:37.290
 so already we see that he is at first 

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:41.220
 rank of unfair lyrics of oncologists 

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:42.209
 it looks like a lot of times actually it 

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:46.350
 filming with a camera 

00:02:42.209 --> 00:02:48.180
 in front of the TV air coup 

00:02:46.350 --> 00:02:50.430
 which quality is not great 

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:54.290
 good at all but then that's actually 

00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:58.319
 that I could see in the video does that 

00:02:54.290 --> 00:03:00.030
 is that it's actually fire 

00:02:58.319 --> 00:03:03.690
 does it hurt us see you there on 

00:03:00.030 --> 00:03:06.060
 the left it's how like if we get 

00:03:03.690 --> 00:03:08.670
 was typing and he was banging 

00:03:06.060 --> 00:03:10.769
 then apart from the fact actually hurts and spock 

00:03:08.670 --> 00:03:13.290
 not by a zombie miss effect touched by 

00:03:10.769 --> 00:03:15.720
 the fire then it shows that we will have 

00:03:13.290 --> 00:03:17.310
 pay attention to the fire will honor after 

00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:19.019
 second image actually is fighting this is where 

00:03:17.310 --> 00:03:21.989
 that it actually appears and then actually 

00:03:19.019 --> 00:03:24.630
 there is the pack to pantxi rectorate side he has 

00:03:21.989 --> 00:03:29.130
 approached an image there one validates one is 

00:03:24.630 --> 00:03:33.090
 in the section of the bar towards the end 

00:03:29.130 --> 00:03:35.190
 we see that the first zombie to online 

00:03:33.090 --> 00:03:39.510
 which was broadcast jumps in the trailer 

00:03:35.190 --> 00:03:41.870
 but in a gameplay mme andree after 

00:03:39.510 --> 00:03:44.640
 there we went to the magic box 

00:03:41.870 --> 00:03:46.079
 to caen we can see that they have I do not like 

00:03:44.640 --> 00:03:48.870
 not that we already knew but here I am 

00:03:46.079 --> 00:03:51.000
 drive you very veiled then after bah 

00:03:48.870 --> 00:03:52.440
 there is everything there and we all have 

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:53.850
 bottom I do not know at all what it is 

00:03:52.440 --> 00:03:55.650
 I think it must be double shot 

00:03:53.850 --> 00:03:57.720
 but I'm not sure what surprises me 

00:03:55.650 --> 00:04:01.730
 it's that these lit and who come I 

00:03:57.720 --> 00:04:04.790
 spend the sleeve then then 

00:04:01.730 --> 00:04:06.409
 then there is a success that you have to see there 

00:04:04.790 --> 00:04:07.940
 must buy two assets before lighting 

00:04:06.409 --> 00:04:09.379
 electricity I think I 

00:04:07.940 --> 00:04:11.500
 asks if assets are already active 

00:04:09.379 --> 00:04:13.730
 and will be co to have electricity what 

00:04:11.500 --> 00:04:16.639
 will look like later I'm sure in 

00:04:13.730 --> 00:04:22.040
 the game otherwise we can see our 

00:04:16.639 --> 00:04:24.949
 first door at the bottom a drop and then 

00:04:22.040 --> 00:04:27.260
 that's all it's lightly taken from 

00:04:24.949 --> 00:04:30.500
 jpeg images put the video but hey 

00:04:27.260 --> 00:04:32.449

00:04:30.500 --> 00:04:33.860

00:04:32.449 --> 00:04:36.350

00:04:33.860 --> 00:04:37.970
 all the time at last me more 

00:04:36.350 --> 00:04:39.770
 quickly possible for example this is 

00:04:37.970 --> 00:04:41.720
 very gameplay outings has to be 

00:04:39.770 --> 00:04:43.820
 a 15 5 minutes I think not from here 

00:04:41.720 --> 00:04:47.270

00:04:43.820 --> 00:04:48.590
