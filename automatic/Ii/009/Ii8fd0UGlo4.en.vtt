00:00:18.529 --> 00:00:18.539 
with me for a long time for me to be

00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:20.720 
with me for a long time for me to be
totally<00:00:18.840> pumped<00:00:19.020> about<00:00:19.289> an<00:00:19.410> HP<00:00:19.710> I<00:00:19.740> product<00:00:20.220> but

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:20.730 
totally pumped about an HP I product but

totally pumped about an HP I product but
this<00:00:21.119> I've<00:00:21.449> got<00:00:21.689> is<00:00:21.869> the<00:00:22.050> bullet<00:00:22.500> st<00:00:22.980> flux<00:00:23.340> I

00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:23.640 
this I've got is the bullet st flux I

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:26.660 
this I've got is the bullet st flux I
think<00:00:24.359> it<00:00:24.779> kind<00:00:25.470> of<00:00:25.590> fits<00:00:25.859> exactly<00:00:26.460> what<00:00:26.580> I've

out or the actual RC out of there you
can<00:01:25.049> kind<00:01:25.140> of<00:01:25.229> get<00:01:25.380> a<00:01:25.409> good<00:01:25.500> look<00:01:25.770> at<00:01:25.979> it<00:01:26.009> it's

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:26.430 
can kind of get a good look at it it's

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:28.280 
can kind of get a good look at it it's
got<00:01:26.549> a<00:01:26.610> lot<00:01:26.790> of<00:01:26.820> orange<00:01:27.090> anodized<00:01:27.630> hardware

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:28.290 
got a lot of orange anodized hardware

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:31.010 
got a lot of orange anodized hardware
it's<00:01:29.009> a<00:01:29.070> three<00:01:29.369> millimeter<00:01:29.579> aluminum<00:01:30.390> chassis

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:31.020 
it's a three millimeter aluminum chassis

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:35.929 
it's a three millimeter aluminum chassis
down<00:01:31.979> below<00:01:33.170> it's<00:01:34.170> got<00:01:34.320> the<00:01:34.439> flux<00:01:34.799> reload<00:01:35.340> ESC

00:01:35.929 --> 00:01:35.939 
down below it's got the flux reload ESC

00:01:35.939 --> 00:01:43.639 
down below it's got the flux reload ESC
and<00:01:35.970> then<00:01:36.329> the<00:01:36.570> flux<00:01:37.200> uh<00:01:37.770> brushless<00:01:39.110> system<00:01:42.649> my

00:01:43.639 --> 00:01:43.649 
and then the flux uh brushless system my

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:46.270 
and then the flux uh brushless system my
one<00:01:43.890> concern<00:01:44.210> right<00:01:45.210> out<00:01:45.360> of<00:01:45.390> the<00:01:45.509> box<00:01:45.750> is<00:01:46.049> I

00:01:46.270 --> 00:01:46.280 
one concern right out of the box is I

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:49.340 
one concern right out of the box is I
being<00:01:47.280> 3s<00:01:47.790> compatible<00:01:48.479> how<00:01:48.659> is<00:01:48.840> he<00:01:49.049> going<00:01:49.290> to

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:49.350 
being 3s compatible how is he going to

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:54.499 
being 3s compatible how is he going to
be<00:01:49.500> I<00:01:49.970> remember<00:01:51.470> exactly<00:01:52.470> what<00:01:53.250> the<00:01:53.310> kv<00:01:54.149> rating

00:01:54.499 --> 00:01:54.509 
be I remember exactly what the kv rating

00:01:54.509 --> 00:02:01.340 
be I remember exactly what the kv rating
was<00:01:56.540> but<00:01:57.540> I<00:01:57.810> think<00:01:58.700> 4300<00:01:59.700> and<00:01:59.880> being<00:02:00.600> a<00:02:00.659> 9.5

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:01.350 
was but I think 4300 and being a 9.5

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:04.789 
was but I think 4300 and being a 9.5
turn<00:02:02.130> brushless<00:02:02.640> motor<00:02:03.060> it's<00:02:03.990> going<00:02:04.229> to<00:02:04.320> get<00:02:04.500> I

00:02:04.789 --> 00:02:04.799 
turn brushless motor it's going to get I

00:02:04.799 --> 00:02:07.730 
turn brushless motor it's going to get I
mean<00:02:05.579> it's<00:02:05.700> gonna<00:02:05.820> be<00:02:06.000> hot<00:02:06.210> and<00:02:06.780> so<00:02:07.380> I<00:02:07.439> do<00:02:07.500> have

00:02:07.730 --> 00:02:07.740 
mean it's gonna be hot and so I do have

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:09.589 
mean it's gonna be hot and so I do have
some<00:02:07.799> fears<00:02:08.280> but<00:02:08.459> I<00:02:08.489> I<00:02:08.819> will<00:02:09.149> tell<00:02:09.360> you<00:02:09.450> this

00:04:15.920 --> 00:04:15.930 
know it's going to be light but you know

00:04:15.930 --> 00:04:20.690 
know it's going to be light but you know
we'll<00:04:16.080> find<00:04:16.260> out<00:04:17.600> obviously<00:04:18.600> um<00:04:19.549> what<00:04:20.549> else

00:04:20.690 --> 00:04:20.700 
we'll find out obviously um what else

00:04:20.700 --> 00:04:22.000 
we'll find out obviously um what else
can<00:04:20.850> I<00:04:20.910> tell<00:04:21.120> you<00:04:21.270> about<00:04:21.330> it<00:04:21.540> I<00:04:21.570> mean<00:04:21.720> really

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:22.010 
can I tell you about it I mean really

00:04:22.010 --> 00:04:24.530 
can I tell you about it I mean really
the<00:04:23.010> brushless<00:04:23.280> motor<00:04:23.669> like<00:04:23.850> I<00:04:23.970> said<00:04:24.150> it<00:04:24.270> can

00:04:24.530 --> 00:04:24.540 
the brushless motor like I said it can

00:04:24.540 --> 00:04:27.710 
the brushless motor like I said it can
is<00:04:24.840> actually<00:04:25.169> pretty<00:04:25.530> small<00:04:26.600> be

00:04:27.710 --> 00:04:27.720 
is actually pretty small be

00:04:27.720 --> 00:04:31.130 
is actually pretty small be
in<00:04:27.780> 4300<00:04:28.530> kv<00:04:28.830> 9.5<00:04:29.340> turn<00:04:29.640> I<00:04:29.970> am<00:04:30.300> very<00:04:30.840> concerned

00:04:31.130 --> 00:04:31.140 
in 4300 kv 9.5 turn I am very concerned

00:04:31.140 --> 00:04:34.130 
in 4300 kv 9.5 turn I am very concerned
about<00:04:31.470> heat<00:04:31.880> but<00:04:32.880> other<00:04:33.300> than<00:04:33.540> that<00:04:33.720> this<00:04:33.930> is

00:04:34.130 --> 00:04:34.140 
about heat but other than that this is

00:04:34.140 --> 00:04:38.000 
about heat but other than that this is
that's<00:04:34.350> really<00:04:34.710> my<00:04:35.010> only<00:04:36.020> big<00:04:37.020> time<00:04:37.260> concern<00:04:37.710> I

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:38.010 
that's really my only big time concern I

00:04:38.010 --> 00:04:40.280 
that's really my only big time concern I
mean<00:04:38.420> things<00:04:39.420> need<00:04:39.630> to<00:04:39.720> be<00:04:39.810> tightened<00:04:40.050> down<00:04:40.200> a

00:04:40.280 --> 00:04:40.290 
mean things need to be tightened down a

00:04:40.290 --> 00:04:41.840 
mean things need to be tightened down a
little<00:04:40.560> bit<00:04:40.800> but<00:04:41.010> that's<00:04:41.190> that's<00:04:41.610> pretty

00:04:41.840 --> 00:04:41.850 
little bit but that's that's pretty

00:04:41.850 --> 00:04:44.300 
little bit but that's that's pretty
standard<00:04:42.330> with<00:04:42.420> any<00:04:42.660> kit<00:04:43.020> HB<00:04:43.710> I<00:04:43.740> tracked<00:04:44.130> this

00:04:44.300 --> 00:04:44.310 
standard with any kit HB I tracked this

00:04:44.310 --> 00:04:47.260 
standard with any kit HB I tracked this
all<00:04:44.580> the<00:04:44.700> way<00:04:44.820> down<00:04:45.660> to<00:04:45.870> off-brand<00:04:46.500> stuff

00:04:47.260 --> 00:04:47.270 
all the way down to off-brand stuff

00:04:47.270 --> 00:04:49.850 
all the way down to off-brand stuff
immediate<00:04:48.270> things<00:04:48.450> got<00:04:48.660> a<00:04:48.690> metal<00:04:48.930> opinion

00:04:49.850 --> 00:04:49.860 
immediate things got a metal opinion

00:04:49.860 --> 00:04:53.000 
immediate things got a metal opinion
I<00:04:49.890> see<00:04:50.610> the<00:04:50.730> plastic<00:04:50.940> spur<00:04:51.450> gear<00:04:51.870> I<00:04:52.050> do<00:04:52.710> like

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:53.010 
I see the plastic spur gear I do like

00:04:53.010 --> 00:04:55.760 
I see the plastic spur gear I do like
the<00:04:53.130> battery<00:04:53.460> box<00:04:53.610> I'm<00:04:54.180> not<00:04:54.630> sure<00:04:54.930> you<00:04:55.590> might

00:04:55.760 --> 00:04:55.770 
the battery box I'm not sure you might

00:04:55.770 --> 00:04:57.650 
the battery box I'm not sure you might
have<00:04:55.950> some<00:04:56.220> problems<00:04:56.760> fitting<00:04:57.150> large

00:04:57.650 --> 00:04:57.660 
have some problems fitting large

00:04:57.660 --> 00:05:00.170 
have some problems fitting large
capacity<00:04:58.530> batteries<00:04:58.920> in<00:04:59.070> there<00:04:59.250> it<00:05:00.150> looks

00:05:00.170 --> 00:05:00.180 
capacity batteries in there it looks

00:05:00.180 --> 00:05:03.350 
capacity batteries in there it looks
kind<00:05:00.630> of<00:05:00.720> thin<00:05:01.610> so<00:05:02.610> if<00:05:02.730> you<00:05:02.820> are<00:05:03.000> going<00:05:03.150> to<00:05:03.210> run

00:05:03.350 --> 00:05:03.360 
kind of thin so if you are going to run

00:05:03.360 --> 00:05:05.390 
kind of thin so if you are going to run
a<00:05:03.390> 3s<00:05:03.960> it's<00:05:04.260> probably<00:05:04.620> going<00:05:04.740> to<00:05:04.800> have<00:05:05.070> to<00:05:05.100> be<00:05:05.370> a

00:05:05.390 --> 00:05:05.400 
a 3s it's probably going to have to be a

00:05:05.400 --> 00:05:09.650 
a 3s it's probably going to have to be a
hard<00:05:05.700> a<00:05:05.970> hard<00:05:06.300> shell<00:05:06.540> 3s<00:05:07.020> I'm<00:05:07.290> guessing<00:05:08.630> but<00:05:09.630> I

00:05:09.650 --> 00:05:09.660 
hard a hard shell 3s I'm guessing but I

00:05:09.660 --> 00:05:10.760 
hard a hard shell 3s I'm guessing but I
mean<00:05:09.900> that's<00:05:10.080> not<00:05:10.170> the<00:05:10.290> end<00:05:10.440> of<00:05:10.500> the<00:05:10.590> world

00:05:10.760 --> 00:05:10.770 
mean that's not the end of the world

00:05:10.770 --> 00:05:13.040 
mean that's not the end of the world
seems<00:05:11.640> very<00:05:11.850> well<00:05:12.150> built<00:05:12.390> I<00:05:12.570> mean<00:05:12.720> immediate

00:05:13.040 --> 00:05:13.050 
seems very well built I mean immediate

00:05:13.050 --> 00:05:14.750 
seems very well built I mean immediate
upgrades<00:05:13.470> I<00:05:13.620> think<00:05:13.800> the<00:05:13.920> shocks<00:05:14.190> would<00:05:14.400> make<00:05:14.550> a

00:05:14.750 --> 00:05:14.760 
upgrades I think the shocks would make a

00:05:14.760 --> 00:05:17.750 
upgrades I think the shocks would make a
lot<00:05:15.390> of<00:05:15.450> sense<00:05:15.810> the<00:05:16.200> travel<00:05:16.860> is<00:05:16.950> okay<00:05:17.310> I<00:05:17.610> just

00:05:17.750 --> 00:05:17.760 
lot of sense the travel is okay I just

00:05:17.760 --> 00:05:20.090 
lot of sense the travel is okay I just
see<00:05:18.360> these<00:05:18.510> not<00:05:18.960> lasting<00:05:19.500> very<00:05:19.590> long<00:05:19.710> but

00:05:20.090 --> 00:05:20.100 
see these not lasting very long but

00:05:20.100 --> 00:05:21.860 
see these not lasting very long but
again<00:05:20.370> the<00:05:20.580> price<00:05:20.970> point<00:05:21.210> on<00:05:21.300> this<00:05:21.419> is<00:05:21.600> under

00:05:21.860 --> 00:05:21.870 
again the price point on this is under

00:05:21.870 --> 00:05:24.680 
again the price point on this is under
400<00:05:22.320> bucks<00:05:22.730> so<00:05:23.730> I<00:05:23.760> think<00:05:23.910> with<00:05:24.180> my<00:05:24.330> coupons

00:05:24.680 --> 00:05:24.690 
400 bucks so I think with my coupons

00:05:24.690 --> 00:05:26.540 
400 bucks so I think with my coupons
owes<00:05:24.840> like<00:05:24.990> closer<00:05:25.200> to<00:05:25.350> 350<00:05:25.950> so<00:05:26.160> for<00:05:26.340> the<00:05:26.400> price

00:05:26.540 --> 00:05:26.550 
owes like closer to 350 so for the price

00:05:26.550 --> 00:05:27.770 
owes like closer to 350 so for the price
point<00:05:26.610> it<00:05:26.910> seems<00:05:27.090> like<00:05:27.210> you<00:05:27.300> get<00:05:27.419> a<00:05:27.450> really

00:05:27.770 --> 00:05:27.780 
point it seems like you get a really

00:05:27.780 --> 00:05:30.680 
point it seems like you get a really
good<00:05:28.020> kid<00:05:28.260> I<00:05:28.440> do<00:05:29.130> I<00:05:29.640> do<00:05:29.700> like<00:05:29.850> these<00:05:30.120> tires<00:05:30.419> and

00:05:30.680 --> 00:05:30.690 
good kid I do I do like these tires and

00:05:30.690 --> 00:05:32.930 
good kid I do I do like these tires and
rims<00:05:30.950> I<00:05:31.950> think<00:05:32.370> they're<00:05:32.460> going<00:05:32.550> to<00:05:32.640> handle

00:05:32.930 --> 00:05:32.940 
rims I think they're going to handle

00:05:32.940 --> 00:05:34.310 
rims I think they're going to handle
really<00:05:33.240> good<00:05:33.419> it<00:05:33.540> mean<00:05:33.990> they<00:05:34.080> need<00:05:34.140> to<00:05:34.260> be

00:05:34.310 --> 00:05:34.320 
really good it mean they need to be

00:05:34.320 --> 00:05:35.510 
really good it mean they need to be
tightened<00:05:34.650> down<00:05:34.680> a<00:05:34.770> little<00:05:34.919> bit<00:05:35.070> more<00:05:35.250> but

00:05:35.510 --> 00:05:35.520 
tightened down a little bit more but

00:05:35.520 --> 00:05:40.220 
tightened down a little bit more but
they<00:05:36.480> it<00:05:36.930> reminds<00:05:37.380> me<00:05:37.410> a<00:05:37.530> lot<00:05:37.710> of<00:05:37.770> the<00:05:38.870> the<00:05:39.870> Flex

00:05:40.220 --> 00:05:40.230 
they it reminds me a lot of the the Flex

00:05:40.230 --> 00:05:42.950 
they it reminds me a lot of the the Flex
mini<00:05:41.160> that<00:05:41.400> I<00:05:41.430> had<00:05:41.669> I<00:05:41.880> think<00:05:42.150> that<00:05:42.330> we<00:05:42.720> did<00:05:42.870> all

00:05:42.950 --> 00:05:42.960 
mini that I had I think that we did all

00:05:42.960 --> 00:05:44.360 
mini that I had I think that we did all
the<00:05:43.050> running<00:05:43.200> videos<00:05:43.530> for<00:05:43.740> everything<00:05:44.070> I<00:05:44.160> just

00:05:44.360 --> 00:05:44.370 
the running videos for everything I just

00:05:44.370 --> 00:05:47.800 
the running videos for everything I just
it's<00:05:44.610> a<00:05:44.760> little<00:05:45.000> wider<00:05:45.210> stance<00:05:45.570> I<00:05:45.870> think<00:05:46.669> but

00:05:47.800 --> 00:05:47.810 
it's a little wider stance I think but

00:05:47.810 --> 00:05:50.719 
it's a little wider stance I think but
you<00:05:48.810> know<00:05:48.900> overall<00:05:49.140> this<00:05:49.440> the<00:05:50.070> Bullitt<00:05:50.400> st

00:05:50.719 --> 00:05:50.729 
you know overall this the Bullitt st

00:05:50.729 --> 00:05:53.570 
you know overall this the Bullitt st
flex<00:05:51.030> seems<00:05:51.270> like<00:05:51.419> a<00:05:51.450> really<00:05:51.810> solid<00:05:52.140> kit<00:05:52.580> for

00:05:53.570 --> 00:05:53.580 
flex seems like a really solid kit for

00:05:53.580 --> 00:05:55.370 
flex seems like a really solid kit for
four-wheel<00:05:53.940> drive<00:05:54.180> waterproof<00:05:54.750> all<00:05:54.930> around<00:05:55.229> I

00:05:55.370 --> 00:05:55.380 
four-wheel drive waterproof all around I

00:05:55.380 --> 00:05:57.380 
four-wheel drive waterproof all around I
think<00:05:55.440> this<00:05:55.740> is<00:05:55.890> a<00:05:55.919> real<00:05:56.340> good<00:05:56.580> competitor<00:05:57.180> I

00:05:57.380 --> 00:05:57.390 
think this is a real good competitor I

00:05:57.390 --> 00:05:59.030 
think this is a real good competitor I
mean<00:05:58.260> if<00:05:58.320> the<00:05:58.410> price<00:05:58.620> point<00:05:58.860> it's<00:05:58.979> actually

00:05:59.030 --> 00:05:59.040 
mean if the price point it's actually

00:05:59.040 --> 00:06:02.990 
mean if the price point it's actually
cheaper<00:05:59.669> than<00:05:59.700> something<00:06:00.240> like<00:06:00.419> the<00:06:02.000> Stampede

00:06:02.990 --> 00:06:03.000 
cheaper than something like the Stampede

00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:05.930 
cheaper than something like the Stampede
