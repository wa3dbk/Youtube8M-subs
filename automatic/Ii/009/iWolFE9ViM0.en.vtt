00:00:01.879 --> 00:00:06.299
 hello and welcome on piscopo drama dog 

00:00:04.380 --> 00:00:08.790
 that deals with battery and surroundings 

00:00:06.299 --> 00:00:11.130
 today I will talk about how to find the right one 

00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:14.309
 battery posture and tightness 

00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:15.870
 also how to position how to find the 

00:00:14.309 --> 00:00:19.650
 own art okay you got it 

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:25.640
 ok all the kids start from the seat 

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:28.740
 take your seat sit at 

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:30.269
 spend your feet on the ground 

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:34.290
 lean on the ground 

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:36.899
 the right height after which to start is 

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:37.620
 when your thighs are parallel to the 

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:42.180
 floor 

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:46.200
 ii to start your search 

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:49.610
 free height found when 

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:49.610
 you are perfectly balanced 

00:00:49.780 --> 00:00:53.170
 and rest assured you feel at ease 

00:00:52.090 --> 00:00:57.250
 on the seat 

00:00:53.170 --> 00:01:01.210
 from there you start to place all the 

00:00:57.250 --> 00:01:06.610
 I remain the basics that will surely remain 

00:01:01.210 --> 00:01:09.310
 fixed to your set are hi-hat 

00:01:06.610 --> 00:01:13.479
 snare drum and home while everything else 

00:01:09.310 --> 00:01:14.200
 definitely 23 in your life 

00:01:13.479 --> 00:01:17.020
 musical 

00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:19.420
 you will do them because maybe in that place 

00:01:17.020 --> 00:01:24.910
 there is not all the battery and that is 

00:01:19.420 --> 00:01:28.899
 to the rampl microphones to what you are 

00:01:24.910 --> 00:01:32.310
 therefore these things seem to be the eardrums i 

00:01:28.899 --> 00:01:35.229
 dishes everything else can change you 

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:38.009
 I have always always returned the 

00:01:35.229 --> 00:01:40.899
 set I made myself a more minimal thing 

00:01:38.009 --> 00:01:44.740
 anyway so let's try a lot of 

00:01:40.899 --> 00:01:47.050
 fasten the case and hi-hat and roller well 

00:01:44.740 --> 00:01:49.020
 you're on your seat guys me 

00:01:47.050 --> 00:01:52.690
 I recommend you buy yourself a comfortable seat 

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:53.829
 because you will be sitting there for so many hours 

00:01:52.690 --> 00:01:56.350
 something goal 

00:01:53.829 --> 00:02:01.180
 I look at advice that certain customs 

00:01:56.350 --> 00:02:04.680
 of the dixon dic I am at 80 euros ie it is 

00:02:01.180 --> 00:02:07.899
 phenomenal unbeatable price quality 

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:12.340
 first thing to fix and roulant 

00:02:07.899 --> 00:02:16.019
 take your snare drum between me and 

00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:16.019
 put in the middle between the legs 

00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:21.819
 once put in the middle there is the find 

00:02:19.060 --> 00:02:24.370
 in the rind height the right height a 

00:02:21.819 --> 00:02:27.040
 snare drum in my opinion is found taking 

00:02:24.370 --> 00:02:27.540
 your wand or wands like you 

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:31.840
 apparently 

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:34.540
 take your arms raise your arms a 

00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:37.000
 half carried in front of snare drum and this one 

00:02:34.540 --> 00:02:40.090
 is the right height derived more than anything else 

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:43.780
 name I am because in my opinion not 

00:02:40.090 --> 00:02:46.480
 manage to bring the right power to the 

00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:49.569
 just the right strength maybe to right 

00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:52.720
 height is half and half and drops by 

00:02:49.569 --> 00:02:55.209
 a few centimeters if it comes back to me like that 

00:02:52.720 --> 00:02:57.310
 tele arms take your forearm a 

00:02:55.209 --> 00:03:00.190
 half if you put too bright 

00:02:57.310 --> 00:03:03.850
 you risk touching your thighs when 

00:03:00.190 --> 00:03:06.549
 you play so it's a little awkward found a 

00:03:03.850 --> 00:03:09.670
 this height the eardrums come from 

00:03:06.549 --> 00:03:11.410
 Consequently so once found 

00:03:09.670 --> 00:03:12.190
 snare drum and the timpani are a 

00:03:11.410 --> 00:03:15.100
 place 

00:03:12.190 --> 00:03:17.049
 away and timpani charleston and crate back then 

00:03:15.100 --> 00:03:17.700
 with the said caban feet resting against 

00:03:17.049 --> 00:03:21.040
 land 

00:03:17.700 --> 00:03:25.859
 como of a position in which it returns 

00:03:21.040 --> 00:03:28.600
 well take the charleston room o 

00:03:25.859 --> 00:03:31.900
 place the pedal where it is placed 

00:03:28.600 --> 00:03:34.750
 that is, we had exactly the most 

00:03:31.900 --> 00:03:37.269
 the appeal you should have put my foot on 

00:03:34.750 --> 00:03:40.780
 you were comfortable under it 

00:03:37.269 --> 00:03:44.200
 special stop so same thing the checkout 

00:03:40.780 --> 00:03:46.030
 where you have the whole foot supported 

00:03:44.200 --> 00:03:49.330
 quietly picks up bonci from the cash desk 

00:03:46.030 --> 00:03:52.900
 release the pedal of the box below 

00:03:49.330 --> 00:03:55.240
 the base you have it point just 

00:03:52.900 --> 00:03:57.690
 the dishes the tom is all matter 

00:03:55.240 --> 00:04:01.840
 irradiated question of where to return 

00:03:57.690 --> 00:04:04.180
 obviously don't make things too much 

00:04:01.840 --> 00:04:07.150
 far and boys why you have to go 

00:04:04.180 --> 00:04:11.320
 in you you must play attentive and the 

00:04:07.150 --> 00:04:12.850
 distance from here the snare drum can buy 

00:04:11.320 --> 00:04:15.100
 be a very long distance for 

00:04:12.850 --> 00:04:17.620
 certain speeds so here he you have to 

00:04:15.100 --> 00:04:22.710
 make these these time 

00:04:17.620 --> 00:04:25.270
 better to have everything here in little 

00:04:22.710 --> 00:04:25.690
 attention to distances because also from 

00:04:25.270 --> 00:04:30.840
 here 

00:04:25.690 --> 00:04:35.740
 eagle and aquis and can be a distance 

00:04:30.840 --> 00:04:38.350
 long accepted at certain speeds therefore 

00:04:35.740 --> 00:04:42.510
 get in everything within reach 

00:04:38.350 --> 00:04:45.700
 wand that is you from here 

00:04:42.510 --> 00:04:48.460
 simply by stretching the little bit a little 

00:04:45.700 --> 00:04:51.850
 arm you have to get to tom the raid ai 

00:04:48.460 --> 00:04:54.700
 you don't have to crash and everything else 

00:04:51.850 --> 00:04:57.820
 strive to stretch with the body 

00:04:54.700 --> 00:05:00.760
 no you have to do crashes 

00:04:57.820 --> 00:05:02.770
 no here in front but then you must still 

00:05:00.760 --> 00:05:06.040
 quietly playing to be able 

00:05:02.770 --> 00:05:07.660
 to play everything so this is also 

00:05:06.040 --> 00:05:10.300
 the right distance from others 

00:05:07.660 --> 00:05:12.370
 components that you then go to add 

00:05:10.300 --> 00:05:14.290
 then the boys who must have said 

00:05:12.370 --> 00:05:15.510
 all this at the base but you know 

00:05:14.290 --> 00:05:18.970
 in the end what is the secret 

00:05:15.510 --> 00:05:21.340
 the secret of almost anything there 

00:05:18.970 --> 00:05:23.860
 battery is that once you have 

00:05:21.340 --> 00:05:25.480
 understood how it is found 

00:05:23.860 --> 00:05:28.510
 there is a note that you have understood the basis 

00:05:25.480 --> 00:05:31.390
 do what the hell do you think I do? 

00:05:28.510 --> 00:05:33.340
 I've seen people tell you about flying 

00:05:31.390 --> 00:05:34.900
 put it to methane but I saw it 

00:05:33.340 --> 00:05:36.240
 people that the snare actually conceals 

00:05:34.900 --> 00:05:40.090
 at the knees 

00:05:36.240 --> 00:05:42.580
 yet they sound, that is, or those who have it 

00:05:40.090 --> 00:05:45.100
 everything eventually comes down to how you 

00:05:42.580 --> 00:05:48.880
 come back if employees come back to play the 

00:05:45.100 --> 00:05:49.639
 battery with snare drum is already at 7 o'clock 

00:05:48.880 --> 00:05:52.580
 returns 

00:05:49.639 --> 00:05:54.409
 and it is your business the important thing is that you do 

00:05:52.580 --> 00:05:55.639
 your work in the sense that you carry the 

00:05:54.409 --> 00:06:00.620
 good weather 

00:05:55.639 --> 00:06:02.990
 then you play it with your feet as if it were like 

00:06:00.620 --> 00:06:04.990
 you almost feel like you are almost like you 

00:06:02.990 --> 00:06:07.610
 back this this is the secret that 

00:06:04.990 --> 00:06:10.909
 I wanted to leave for the big finale 

00:06:07.610 --> 00:06:12.800
 that is, in the end I tell you, that is, learn 

00:06:10.909 --> 00:06:16.610
 art and put it aside 

00:06:12.800 --> 00:06:18.830
 it is precisely the aphorism of the Madonna 

00:06:16.610 --> 00:06:21.979
 ok guys i said all do me 

00:06:18.830 --> 00:06:24.529
 know if you found yours the 

00:06:21.979 --> 00:06:27.110
 your set your height 

00:06:24.529 --> 00:06:28.729
 if it was a simple thing or you are 

00:06:27.110 --> 00:06:31.629
 put them you made the square root 

00:06:28.729 --> 00:06:33.620
 of bombs no to any questions 

00:06:31.629 --> 00:06:39.080
