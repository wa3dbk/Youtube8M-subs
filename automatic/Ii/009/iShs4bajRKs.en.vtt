 Translated by Enrique LÃ³pez for: www.teveycineperu.com 

00:00:14.742 --> 00:00:15.694
 He told me to come and pick you up 

00:00:18.468 --> 00:00:19.987
 You really spoil my vacation 

00:00:20.202 --> 00:00:21.144
 So ... can we go, please? 

00:00:22.704 --> 00:00:23.918
 You're not going to get in the car, right? 

00:00:24.684 --> 00:00:25.325
 I do not think so 

00:00:30.161 --> 00:00:32.373
 SHE IS THE MOST VALUABLE WEAPON OF OUR NATION 

00:00:34.094 --> 00:00:34.557
 Do you have a car? 

00:00:38.448 --> 00:00:39.724
 IT IS WHAT THEY TRAINED 

00:00:40.235 --> 00:00:42.872
 The negotiations were ruined, so I need someone to pick up the guy 

00:00:46.897 --> 00:00:48.173
 Wow ... is that real? 

00:00:49.761 --> 00:00:50.638
 Ooohh..siii 

00:00:51.495 --> 00:00:53.037
 IT IS WHAT YOU WANTED 

00:00:53.316 --> 00:00:53.940
 I have an assignment 

00:00:54.367 --> 00:00:55.221
 It's like paid vacations 

00:00:56.186 --> 00:00:57.001
 Diplomatic plates 

00:00:57.358 --> 00:00:58.156
 If there is an emergency 

00:00:58.433 --> 00:00:59.236
 You put them on your face 

00:01:00.118 --> 00:01:01.176
 Do you want me to be "Eyecandy"? 

00:01:01.479 --> 00:01:02.645
 You would be the perfect couple 

00:01:03.440 --> 00:01:04.126
 THEN WHY... 

00:01:05.936 --> 00:01:06.746
 THE BETRAYED IT? 

00:01:14.124 --> 00:01:14.601
 Paul? 

00:01:16.543 --> 00:01:17.417
 Did the divorce conclude? 

00:01:20.085 --> 00:01:20.681
 Paul, are you there? 

00:01:23.972 --> 00:01:24.439
 Malorie 

00:01:25.249 --> 00:01:26.109
 DIRECTOR STEVEN SODERBERGH 

00:01:26.341 --> 00:01:27.435
 The deal in Barcelona collapsed 

00:01:27.949 --> 00:01:28.387
 !Fix it up! 

00:01:30.102 --> 00:01:31.057
 WHEN THEY LEFT IT WITHOUT ANYTHING 

00:01:31.057 --> 00:01:32.566
 You can tell me why they betrayed me now ... 

00:01:33.129 --> 00:01:34.952
 or you can wait until I have my hands around your throat 

00:01:35.750 --> 00:01:37.213
 THEY DID NOT LEAVE ALTERNATIVE 

00:01:38.353 --> 00:01:42.522
 She should be in her father's living room telling her that she killed a man in cold blood 

00:01:45.231 --> 00:01:45.872
 Keep your eyes open 

00:01:46.201 --> 00:01:47.702
 I have not closed them since you were born 

00:01:51.103 --> 00:01:51.830
 SOON 

00:01:52.306 --> 00:01:52.878
 Keep your head down! 

00:01:55.931 --> 00:01:56.789
 FINDING THE TRUTH 

00:01:57.292 --> 00:01:57.918
 Should I be nervous? 

00:01:58.244 --> 00:01:58.701
 I will let you know 

00:01:59.114 --> 00:01:59.697
 What do you know about her? 

00:02:00.367 --> 00:02:01.049
 She was a marine .. 

00:02:01.049 --> 00:02:03.044
 If he does something there must be a reason for that 

00:02:03.598 --> 00:02:05.299
 IT WILL BE YOUR MOST DANGEROUS MISSION 

00:02:05.940 --> 00:02:07.183
 She is a public threat 

00:02:07.867 --> 00:02:08.324
 What did you do? 

00:02:08.324 --> 00:02:09.768
 I did what I was hired to do 

00:02:12.990 --> 00:02:15.517
 Is not there someone you should be calling for help? 

00:02:25.385 --> 00:02:26.185
 You better run 

00:02:28.695 --> 00:02:29.921
 SOON
