 more and in this case I'm going to bring you 

00:00:05.959 --> 00:00:10.910
 very cool information of achievements 

00:00:08.660 --> 00:00:13.339
 filtered from the new text map zombies 

00:00:10.910 --> 00:00:16.400
 from where he will be in the dlc 

00:00:13.339 --> 00:00:17.450
 reckoning that leaves on August 4 in 

00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:19.100
 Xbox Live 

00:00:17.450 --> 00:00:21.050
 I will bring all the achievements that have been 

00:00:19.100 --> 00:00:23.150
 filtered from that map you know that every 

00:00:21.050 --> 00:00:24.950
 Once a map of zombies comes out 

00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:26.810
 filter achievements before by a page 

00:00:24.950 --> 00:00:28.580
 I do not know how he gets it but good 

00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:30.290
 here are the achievements and I'm going to 

00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:32.930
 explain all of them because they can give us 

00:00:30.290 --> 00:00:34.880
 many clues how it will go more or 

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:36.590
 minus the map of why style will go 

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:38.390
 because it is a pod and that they are going to 

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:40.790
 be the objectives and a little bit also a 

00:00:38.390 --> 00:00:42.500
 little idea of ​​how the interest will be 

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:44.300
 of this map the truth I have enough 

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:47.239
 I want you to come out but well before 

00:00:44.300 --> 00:00:48.710
 start with the super achievements tell you that 

00:00:47.239 --> 00:00:51.620
 if you have not seen the video that went up 

00:00:48.710 --> 00:00:53.300
 yesterday about the new legendary weapon asm 

00:00:51.620 --> 00:00:54.980
 1 well, I recommend that you spend 

00:00:53.300 --> 00:00:56.510
 you have it down there in the channel because 

00:00:54.980 --> 00:00:59.000
 the truth is a very very cool video 

00:00:56.510 --> 00:01:01.460
 then nothing will we start with these 

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:03.110
 achievements that have been taken from a 

00:01:01.460 --> 00:01:04.759
 page and I have taken it was difficult 

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:06.500
 and you're going to have it on the screen 

00:01:04.759 --> 00:01:08.600
 they are going to give us a lot of information 

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:10.580
 what he tells us with the text and also 

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:12.560
 It will indicate a bit of the images 

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:15.830
 that we're going to start with the first 

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:18.200
 achievement smooth operator who tells us he wins 

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:20.270
 to off on the good descent map not 

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:22.970
 the face comes out the image does not come out 

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:24.530
 face of off and it is very simple is a 

00:01:22.970 --> 00:01:27.500
 zombie and we're going to have to kill him between 

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:29.660
 all and if we kill him he will make them beat 

00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:31.640
 achievements that are 10 10 that is worth 

00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:33.800
 then we're going to spend the second that 

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:38.119
 who says garlic of might have failed 

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:40.340
 beat oz again on descent we have to 

00:01:38.119 --> 00:01:43.190
 beat him twice now and as 

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:45.140
 we are seeing it seems already in the photo already 

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:47.090
 It seems that it is not so much as it seems 

00:01:45.140 --> 00:01:48.290
 an alien the big alien that came out in the 

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:50.240
 trailer looks like it has already 

00:01:48.290 --> 00:01:51.619
 evolved and we have to give it another 

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:54.020
 time after killing at the first time 

00:01:51.619 --> 00:01:55.460
 we have to beat him again and now 

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:57.560
 it seems like it's more powerful as 

00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:59.990
 you are seeing are 20 axes is double 

00:01:57.560 --> 00:02:01.130
 that the first one and it's a lot more 

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:03.320
 it seems that this pimp action this 

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:05.450
 this achievement we continue that the achievement of 

00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:07.370
 meeting that says we complete the 

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:10.369
 challenges of today in 

00:02:07.370 --> 00:02:11.840
 the mother of this one we can see that there 

00:02:10.369 --> 00:02:13.820
 as people gathered and will be 

00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:15.200
 simply between all the systems 

00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:17.120
 playing we have to complete the 

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:18.860
 challenges that we will be putting of 

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:20.240
 this whole country that roughly 

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:22.280
 focuses on what is the end of the 

00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:24.200
 medical history understand it and everything is 

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:26.150
 basically that if the voice that wins 

00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:27.740
 they make the challenges there is some other achievement 

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:30.200
 that's different but I say 

00:02:27.740 --> 00:02:31.910
 that everything revolves around that next 

00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:33.440
 achievement constructs that are 20 axes 

00:02:31.910 --> 00:02:35.690
 also like the previous one that I think came out 

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:37.550
 say no the previous are 50 people sorry 

00:02:35.690 --> 00:02:39.380
 that this one is pretty big enough or 

00:02:37.550 --> 00:02:41.150
 be the previous one the meeting are 50 hes 

00:02:39.380 --> 00:02:43.790
 and this one in which we are now caustic 

00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:45.950
 are 20 is basically is the following you 

00:02:43.790 --> 00:02:48.080
 says you have to cross the water with 

00:02:45.950 --> 00:02:49.970
 A teleporter wins on the map 

00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:51.980
 of stent simply open grenades that 

00:02:49.970 --> 00:02:54.290
 it costs you to transport the strips 

00:02:51.980 --> 00:02:56.660
 on one side of the water from one water to the other and 

00:02:54.290 --> 00:02:58.550
 you transport yourself and simply with that you 

00:02:56.660 --> 00:03:00.680
 they will give this then I see I am 20 genes 

00:02:58.550 --> 00:03:03.710
 next 6 2 size mother yes 

00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:05.840
 matter tells you what punches I do with a 

00:03:03.710 --> 00:03:07.460
 goal and do the stent in the trailer if not 

00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:09.920
 you know well, it came out that we could 

00:03:07.460 --> 00:03:11.720
 use in this case a goal since they are already 

00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:13.459
 you know that sometimes I will use the sidrón 

00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:13.940
 of attacks and turrets then in this for 

00:03:13.459 --> 00:03:16.160
 we go 

00:03:13.940 --> 00:03:19.120
 use the goliat and he asks us to 

00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:21.920
 knock moza julia julia forgive 

00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:23.900
 with the goliat then they are 20 is also 

00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:26.060
 that seems to be quite simple 

00:03:23.900 --> 00:03:28.730
 and nothing happened to the next one either 

00:03:26.060 --> 00:03:31.280
 I want to entangle a lot here and here you 

00:03:28.730 --> 00:03:33.620
 it says that punch is that punching 20 

00:03:31.280 --> 00:03:34.850
 enemies with the goal is already fine as 

00:03:33.620 --> 00:03:36.440
 good as location then also 

00:03:34.850 --> 00:03:38.600
 you have to understand that one or the other 

00:03:36.440 --> 00:03:40.790
 achievement also revolves around that of 

00:03:38.600 --> 00:03:43.040
 goliat and in this case this one they are not 20 

00:03:40.790 --> 00:03:44.690
 hits and we have to hit 20 enemies 

00:03:43.040 --> 00:03:46.550
 with the goal you already know that he also ran 

00:03:44.690 --> 00:03:50.390
 can punch and you give to believe 

00:03:46.550 --> 00:03:52.880
 that r1 r3 forgiveness and I do not know how you see in 

00:03:50.390 --> 00:03:55.610
 xbox but that meets 3 sr3 ideas there 

00:03:52.880 --> 00:03:58.130
 you can hit next managed to win at 

00:03:55.610 --> 00:04:01.010
 nothing I'm good that tells you that 

00:03:58.130 --> 00:04:03.500
 you have to reach round 7 without 

00:04:01.010 --> 00:04:06.530
 no one opens a door are 20 axes is 

00:04:03.500 --> 00:04:09.230
 as a challenge of these two authors 

00:04:06.530 --> 00:04:10.700
 challenge 'of these that basically 

00:04:09.230 --> 00:04:14.030
 they open doors because you have to get to 

00:04:10.700 --> 00:04:16.730
 get as Chinese to get to the round 

00:04:14.030 --> 00:04:19.400
 number 7 and they fear you get this achievement that 

00:04:16.730 --> 00:04:20.880
 are 20 hes penultimate I think it's the 

00:04:19.400 --> 00:04:23.880
 penultimate achievement and trick 

00:04:20.880 --> 00:04:26.130
 asks you to kill 100 enemies behind 

00:04:23.880 --> 00:04:30.800
 of you with the new special weapon of this 

00:04:26.130 --> 00:04:32.910
 map on street 03 tridente 

00:04:30.800 --> 00:04:36.150
 I think just to kill 100 

00:04:32.910 --> 00:04:37.560
 people the details of you like this 

00:04:36.150 --> 00:04:38.580
 weapon I think it bounces on the walls I think 

00:04:37.560 --> 00:04:40.590
 which is like reading to a wall of 

00:04:38.580 --> 00:04:42.300
 opposite and bounce back from you to 

00:04:40.590 --> 00:04:43.920
 enemies that you come back you have to 

00:04:42.300 --> 00:04:46.190
 mates making guess will be 

00:04:43.920 --> 00:04:49.020
 cumulative if it is not very difficult and 

00:04:46.190 --> 00:04:50.820
 it's simply simply not that and 

00:04:49.020 --> 00:04:52.740
 the last achievement this is a secret achievement 

00:04:50.820 --> 00:04:55.140
 I think it 's the achievement that you have left 

00:04:52.740 --> 00:04:57.840
 when you finish the interest of the tav and 

00:04:55.140 --> 00:04:58.650
 basically tells you to beat that voice the 

00:04:57.840 --> 00:05:00.030
 last time 

00:04:58.650 --> 00:05:02.250
 indecent is to tell you we have to beat 

00:05:00.030 --> 00:05:04.590
 three times we have to win in the 

00:05:02.250 --> 00:05:06.360
 Naked achievement projects we have you 

00:05:04.590 --> 00:05:08.130
 beat in the achievement of how the mighty 

00:05:06.360 --> 00:05:09.870
 heart fail and we have to beat in the 

00:05:08.130 --> 00:05:11.370
 last in the one of turns that I think that 

00:05:09.870 --> 00:05:13.680
 is what they will give you when you finish the 

00:05:11.370 --> 00:05:15.960
 history since there are 50 hayes and it can be 

00:05:13.680 --> 00:05:17.370
 pretty crappy so nothing simply 

00:05:15.960 --> 00:05:18.720
 is that I did not want to roll up much 

00:05:17.370 --> 00:05:20.100
 I was made a video I did not want it anymore 

00:05:18.720 --> 00:05:23.010
 of what I wanted about six 

00:05:20.100 --> 00:05:25.230
 minutes and nothing I'm really looking forward to 

00:05:23.010 --> 00:05:26.880
 let this map come out we are already in 

00:05:25.230 --> 00:05:27.660
 vacation as they try to avoid quite 

00:05:26.880 --> 00:05:30.960
 to the map east 

00:05:27.660 --> 00:05:33.450
 you know August 4 for playstation 2 

00:05:30.960 --> 00:05:35.940

 and those of pc are going to have to put up with 

00:05:43.440 --> 00:05:46.920

00:05:44.880 --> 00:05:48.420

 I hope that you liked social 

00:05:52.320 --> 00:05:56.130

00:05:53.550 --> 00:05:57.180
