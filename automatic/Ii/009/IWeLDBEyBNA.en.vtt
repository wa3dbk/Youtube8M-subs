00:00:00.650 --> 00:00:05.570
 hello friends again javier ruiz de 

00:00:03.319 --> 00:00:09.259
 the mexicanas offering them a video 

00:00:05.570 --> 00:00:13.879
 informative of the new function of the 

00:00:09.259 --> 00:00:16.400
 software for mega copy ps 020 and we have 

00:00:13.879 --> 00:00:19.910
 developed a video is a video like 

00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:21.859
 a manual to see it to see the 

00:00:19.910 --> 00:00:25.310
 faculties of this new software and the 

00:00:21.859 --> 00:00:26.080
 advantages that this has 

00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:28.400
 application 

00:00:26.080 --> 00:00:31.460
 the software works through a 

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:34.130
 programmed key that starts the unit 

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:38.790
 of starting the vehicle and a tech 60 

00:00:34.130 --> 00:00:40.770
 what is this little head 

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:43.230
 which will help us extract the 

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:46.590
 code that we can use how many 

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:50.420
 times it is necessary since it is only 

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:52.370
 to do the calculation around this one 

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:55.449
 of this electronic card that carries 

00:00:52.370 --> 00:00:58.879
 inside the head so they can have 

00:00:55.449 --> 00:01:00.710
 stored head saved and it's not 

00:00:58.879 --> 00:01:02.659
 It is necessary to use one for each 

00:01:00.710 --> 00:01:04.129
 vehicle but we can use one 

00:01:02.659 --> 00:01:07.009
 for the number of vehicles that 

00:01:04.129 --> 00:01:08.720
 need is reused right away we go 

00:01:07.009 --> 00:01:10.759
 to see what the process of 

00:01:08.720 --> 00:01:12.649
 programming the configuration 

00:01:10.759 --> 00:01:15.130
 extraction in this case the code the 

00:01:12.649 --> 00:01:15.130
 same 

00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:21.550
 the first thing we will do in the 

00:01:19.040 --> 00:01:24.550
 procedure is 

00:01:21.550 --> 00:01:27.250
 is the key that is already programmed in the 

00:01:24.550 --> 00:01:28.960
 auto for this process it is necessary that 

00:01:27.250 --> 00:01:31.960
 is not working in the car that 

00:01:28.960 --> 00:01:34.770
 start the engine so we put this 

00:01:31.960 --> 00:01:38.140
 key inside the mega copping 

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:42.360
 let's give the option to read 

00:01:38.140 --> 00:01:42.360
 this is a transponder 46 

00:01:42.680 --> 00:01:46.730
 as we can see here it is already used 

00:01:44.720 --> 00:01:50.000
 it means that it is programmed in the 

00:01:46.730 --> 00:01:52.580
 self that is what proceeds right away 

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:54.740
 let's select the teak part 60 

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:56.740
 and it is necessary to have the software of 

00:01:54.740 --> 00:02:01.280
 cloning of teak 60 to be able to generate 

00:01:56.740 --> 00:02:03.080
 or read the code in this case we remove 

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:06.170
 the key of our half copy and 

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:09.320
 then put the head 

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:14.030
 electronic teak 60 we place you 

00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:17.630
 write very well and we see a 

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:19.970
 message in which he shows us that he has 

00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:22.160
 chlorination has been achieved and we have 

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:26.720
 that going to the car in the car becomes a 

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:29.330
 cycle opens the switch five times 

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:31.940
 the key this has to be the key 

00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:34.250
 that is programmed and the head that 

00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:37.100
 let's make clone should be together 

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:39.530
 two transponder together the switch is opened 

00:02:37.100 --> 00:02:43.070
 last five seconds this is done 

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:45.370
 five times because we're going to do our 

00:02:43.070 --> 00:02:45.370
 process 

00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:52.650
 once we have 

00:02:50.130 --> 00:02:54.010
 I have done the cycle we put again 

00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:58.420
 the 

00:02:54.010 --> 00:03:02.270
 tp x 60 forgiveness inside the cloner and 

00:02:58.420 --> 00:03:05.000
 let's give it in ok 

00:03:02.270 --> 00:03:07.540
 this is only a process is very 

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:11.480
 simple let's go to the part of 

00:03:07.540 --> 00:03:14.540
 special what 

00:03:11.480 --> 00:03:17.659
 once in the special part 

00:03:14.540 --> 00:03:19.760
 of the special tab we have the option 

00:03:17.659 --> 00:03:24.760
 that we see down here that that gene here 

00:03:19.760 --> 00:03:24.760
 to five of calculator from the teak 60 

00:03:25.290 --> 00:03:29.770
 here we just click that tells us 

00:03:27.269 --> 00:03:32.050
 calculate pin 

00:03:29.770 --> 00:03:34.900
 the device makes a calculation through 

00:03:32.050 --> 00:03:38.330
 of internet connects to a server on 

00:03:34.900 --> 00:03:42.530
 which makes this little 

00:03:38.330 --> 00:03:44.959
 this little logic of calculation 

00:03:42.530 --> 00:03:46.970
 in a few minutes we will have the pin code 

00:03:44.959 --> 00:03:52.720
 as here shows us and we are 

00:03:46.970 --> 00:03:56.050
 observing the pin code 75 34 88 

00:03:52.720 --> 00:03:58.400
 this function can offer us the code 

00:03:56.050 --> 00:04:01.579
 pin through a key 

00:03:58.400 --> 00:04:05.930
 sometimes they change computers 

00:04:01.579 --> 00:04:09.140
 engine to cars being common and 

00:04:05.930 --> 00:04:11.180
 then the pin code through the number 

00:04:09.140 --> 00:04:13.459
 Serial and we work not because 

00:04:11.180 --> 00:04:15.290
 has to have an interaction the 

00:04:13.459 --> 00:04:17.930
 code the serial number with the code 

00:04:15.290 --> 00:04:20.449
 pin then if the computer gets the 

00:04:17.930 --> 00:04:22.100
 they replaced obviously obviously not going to 

00:04:20.449 --> 00:04:23.900
 match so here with a key 

00:04:22.100 --> 00:04:26.509
 programmed we can extract the pin code 

00:04:23.900 --> 00:04:29.030
 no need to disassemble the computer 

00:04:26.509 --> 00:04:31.580
 or do some other movement this is 

00:04:29.030 --> 00:04:34.419
 practically what I do what I do 

00:04:31.580 --> 00:04:34.419
 with this software
