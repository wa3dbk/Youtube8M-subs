here and I'm all up in the spawn this is

00:01:06.649 --> 00:01:08.590 
here and I'm all up in the spawn this is
one<00:01:06.890> of<00:01:07.070> the<00:01:07.160> easiest<00:01:07.640> ways<00:01:07.850> to<00:01:07.880> get<00:01:08.240> really

00:01:08.590 --> 00:01:08.600 
one of the easiest ways to get really

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:10.030 
one of the easiest ways to get really
fast<00:01:08.810> my<00:01:09.080> webs<00:01:09.259> actually<00:01:09.649> I<00:01:09.710> don't<00:01:09.770> want<00:01:09.890> to

00:01:10.030 --> 00:01:10.040 
fast my webs actually I don't want to

00:01:10.040 --> 00:01:12.070 
fast my webs actually I don't want to
say<00:01:10.130> it's<00:01:10.280> easy<00:01:10.460> because<00:01:10.729> it's<00:01:11.000> not<00:01:11.180> easy<00:01:11.390> but

00:01:12.070 --> 00:01:12.080 
say it's easy because it's not easy but

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:13.690 
say it's easy because it's not easy but
it's<00:01:12.290> one<00:01:12.500> of<00:01:12.530> the<00:01:12.710> most<00:01:12.950> effective<00:01:13.520> ways<00:01:13.670> to

00:01:13.690 --> 00:01:13.700 
it's one of the most effective ways to

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:15.940 
it's one of the most effective ways to
get<00:01:14.030> really<00:01:14.780> really<00:01:15.080> fast<00:01:15.320> mo<00:01:15.500> ops<00:01:15.649> I<00:01:15.770> think

00:01:15.940 --> 00:01:15.950 
get really really fast mo ops I think

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:18.279 
get really really fast mo ops I think
the<00:01:16.009> fastest<00:01:16.369> move<00:01:16.580> ever<00:01:16.850> was<00:01:17.119> like<00:01:17.300> something

00:01:18.279 --> 00:01:18.289 
the fastest move ever was like something

00:01:18.289 --> 00:01:20.950 
the fastest move ever was like something
crazy<00:01:18.500> like<00:01:18.880> 50<00:01:19.880> something<00:01:20.119> or<00:01:20.330> 60<00:01:20.630> something

00:01:20.950 --> 00:01:20.960 
crazy like 50 something or 60 something

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:22.330 
crazy like 50 something or 60 something
seconds<00:01:21.350> and<00:01:21.470> I<00:01:21.500> think<00:01:21.649> it<00:01:21.710> was<00:01:21.800> in<00:01:21.920> the<00:01:22.009> exact

00:01:22.330 --> 00:01:22.340 
seconds and I think it was in the exact

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:24.490 
seconds and I think it was in the exact
same<00:01:22.550> spot<00:01:22.820> but<00:01:23.509> that<00:01:23.720> first<00:01:23.990> mode<00:01:24.259> you're

00:01:24.490 --> 00:01:24.500 
same spot but that first mode you're

00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:27.340 
same spot but that first mode you're
gonna<00:01:24.590> see<00:01:24.800> right<00:01:24.950> here<00:01:25.190> I<00:01:25.600> try<00:01:26.600> to<00:01:26.660> go<00:01:26.810> deep

00:01:27.340 --> 00:01:27.350 
gonna see right here I try to go deep

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:28.570 
gonna see right here I try to go deep
into<00:01:27.530> the<00:01:27.649> spawn<00:01:27.860> here<00:01:28.070> I<00:01:28.100> missed<00:01:28.399> that<00:01:28.550> shot

00:02:06.219 --> 00:02:06.229 
really obscure places most of the time

00:02:06.229 --> 00:02:07.719 
really obscure places most of the time
when<00:02:06.440> you<00:02:06.500> play<00:02:06.679> solo<00:02:06.950> so<00:02:07.220> you<00:02:07.280> got<00:02:07.520> to<00:02:07.640> be

00:02:07.719 --> 00:02:07.729 
when you play solo so you got to be

00:02:07.729 --> 00:02:09.609 
when you play solo so you got to be
extremely<00:02:08.179> cautious<00:02:08.390> you<00:02:09.020> never<00:02:09.229> know<00:02:09.440> when

00:02:09.609 --> 00:02:09.619 
extremely cautious you never know when

00:03:57.280 --> 00:03:57.290 
right here I called in the Mobe because

00:03:57.290 --> 00:03:58.690 
right here I called in the Mobe because
I<00:03:57.380> saw<00:03:57.530> they<00:03:57.680> all<00:03:57.830> spawned<00:03:58.100> at<00:03:58.220> 8<00:03:58.370> when<00:03:58.610> they

00:03:58.690 --> 00:03:58.700 
I saw they all spawned at 8 when they

00:03:58.700 --> 00:04:00.940 
I saw they all spawned at 8 when they
did<00:03:58.970> that<00:03:59.180> I<00:03:59.390> knew<00:03:59.930> that<00:03:59.960> because<00:04:00.380> I<00:04:00.560> wasn't

00:04:00.940 --> 00:04:00.950 
did that I knew that because I wasn't

00:04:00.950 --> 00:04:02.140 
did that I knew that because I wasn't
looking<00:04:01.160> into<00:04:01.340> the<00:04:01.430> sea<00:04:01.610> spawn<00:04:01.850> they<00:04:02.000> would

00:04:02.140 --> 00:04:02.150 
looking into the sea spawn they would

00:04:02.150 --> 00:04:03.700 
looking into the sea spawn they would
respawn<00:04:02.630> right<00:04:02.900> in<00:04:02.990> the<00:04:03.080> back<00:04:03.230> here<00:04:03.440> which<00:04:03.590> is

00:04:03.700 --> 00:04:03.710 
respawn right in the back here which is

00:04:03.710 --> 00:04:05.320 
respawn right in the back here which is
why<00:04:03.830> I<00:04:03.860> didn't<00:04:04.190> look<00:04:04.310> into<00:04:04.550> the<00:04:04.730> spawn<00:04:04.970> point<00:04:05.210> I

00:04:05.320 --> 00:04:05.330 
why I didn't look into the spawn point I

00:04:05.330 --> 00:04:07.660 
why I didn't look into the spawn point I
laid<00:04:05.540> down<00:04:05.570> let<00:04:06.410> the<00:04:06.530> Moab<00:04:06.680> kill<00:04:07.040> them<00:04:07.220> and<00:04:07.370> as
