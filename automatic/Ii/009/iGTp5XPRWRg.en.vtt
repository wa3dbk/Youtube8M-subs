the<00:00:04.930> teachers<00:00:05.290> are<00:00:05.560> very<00:00:06.330> very<00:00:07.330> they<00:00:07.960> think

00:00:08.310 --> 00:00:08.320 
the teachers are very very they think

00:00:08.320 --> 00:00:10.500 
the teachers are very very they think
outside<00:00:08.710> of<00:00:08.740> the<00:00:08.920> box<00:00:08.950> they<00:00:09.730> don't<00:00:10.059> just<00:00:10.420> make

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:10.510 
outside of the box they don't just make

00:00:10.510 --> 00:00:12.390 
outside of the box they don't just make
us<00:00:10.780> do<00:00:11.110> things<00:00:11.590> in<00:00:11.710> our<00:00:11.770> books<00:00:12.040> they<00:00:12.219> don't

00:00:12.390 --> 00:00:12.400 
us do things in our books they don't

00:00:12.400 --> 00:00:14.129 
us do things in our books they don't
just<00:00:12.520> make<00:00:12.580> us<00:00:12.760> do<00:00:12.910> things<00:00:13.030> on<00:00:13.209> paper<00:00:13.389> we<00:00:14.020> had

00:00:14.129 --> 00:00:14.139 
just make us do things on paper we had

00:00:14.139 --> 00:00:17.279 
just make us do things on paper we had
to<00:00:14.170> use<00:00:14.289> all<00:00:14.650> types<00:00:15.070> of<00:00:15.190> stuff<00:00:15.400> we<00:00:15.610> did<00:00:16.289> some

00:00:17.279 --> 00:00:17.289 
to use all types of stuff we did some

00:00:17.289 --> 00:00:20.880 
to use all types of stuff we did some
things<00:00:17.320> with<00:00:18.510> movement<00:00:19.510> versus<00:00:20.439> time<00:00:20.679> and

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:20.890 
things with movement versus time and

00:00:20.890 --> 00:00:24.749 
things with movement versus time and
everything<00:00:21.279> so<00:00:21.580> with<00:00:22.650> motion<00:00:23.650> detectors<00:00:24.130> it's

00:00:24.749 --> 00:00:24.759 
everything so with motion detectors it's

00:00:24.759 --> 00:00:28.109 
everything so with motion detectors it's
not<00:00:25.750> just<00:00:26.140> one<00:00:27.070> thing<00:00:27.099> that<00:00:27.310> we're<00:00:27.550> doing<00:00:27.580> it's

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:28.119 
not just one thing that we're doing it's

00:00:28.119 --> 00:00:30.509 
not just one thing that we're doing it's
we're<00:00:28.929> doing<00:00:29.169> a<00:00:29.259> lot<00:00:29.439> of<00:00:29.589> different<00:00:29.890> things<00:00:30.070> so

00:00:30.509 --> 00:00:30.519 
we're doing a lot of different things so

00:00:30.519 --> 00:00:34.440 
we're doing a lot of different things so
it<00:00:31.480> it's<00:00:32.140> fun<00:00:32.760> it's<00:00:33.760> exciting<00:00:33.940> it's

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:34.450 
it it's fun it's exciting it's

00:00:34.450 --> 00:00:37.080 
it it's fun it's exciting it's
interesting<00:00:35.380> working<00:00:36.310> with<00:00:36.460> others<00:00:36.760> is<00:00:36.910> one

00:00:37.080 --> 00:00:37.090 
interesting working with others is one

00:00:37.090 --> 00:00:39.240 
interesting working with others is one
of<00:00:37.210> the<00:00:37.330> most<00:00:37.840> important<00:00:38.410> aspects<00:00:39.040> of<00:00:39.160> our

00:00:39.240 --> 00:00:39.250 
of the most important aspects of our

00:00:39.250 --> 00:00:41.730 
of the most important aspects of our
program<00:00:39.460> I<00:00:40.090> would<00:00:40.630> say<00:00:40.870> throughout

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:41.740 
program I would say throughout

00:00:41.740 --> 00:00:44.640 
program I would say throughout
everything<00:00:42.310> that<00:00:42.610> we<00:00:42.760> do<00:00:42.970> we<00:00:43.510> do<00:00:43.990> have<00:00:44.020> some

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:44.650 
everything that we do we do have some

00:00:44.650 --> 00:00:46.980 
everything that we do we do have some
aspects<00:00:45.520> of<00:00:45.640> direct<00:00:46.000> instruction<00:00:46.660> in<00:00:46.840> our

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:46.990 
aspects of direct instruction in our

00:00:46.990 --> 00:00:50.670 
aspects of direct instruction in our
classrooms<00:00:47.530> but<00:00:47.830> it<00:00:48.490> would<00:00:49.030> be<00:00:49.270> maybe<00:00:49.630> 5%<00:00:50.050> of

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:50.680 
classrooms but it would be maybe 5% of

00:00:50.680 --> 00:00:53.730 
classrooms but it would be maybe 5% of
the<00:00:50.860> time<00:00:51.450> most<00:00:52.450> of<00:00:52.750> the<00:00:52.870> rest<00:00:53.080> of<00:00:53.260> it<00:00:53.410> is

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:53.740 
the time most of the rest of it is

00:00:53.740 --> 00:00:58.140 
the time most of the rest of it is
project<00:00:54.550> or<00:00:54.700> problem-based<00:00:55.830> where<00:00:56.830> they<00:00:57.400> work

00:00:58.140 --> 00:00:58.150 
project or problem-based where they work

00:00:58.150 --> 00:01:02.400 
project or problem-based where they work
in<00:00:58.360> groups<00:00:58.810> or<00:00:59.080> partners<00:01:00.240> and<00:01:01.240> and<00:01:01.930> construct

00:01:02.400 --> 00:01:02.410 
in groups or partners and and construct

00:01:02.410 --> 00:01:05.100 
in groups or partners and and construct
the<00:01:02.530> knowledge<00:01:02.830> as<00:01:02.980> as<00:01:03.370> a<00:01:03.400> group<00:01:03.869> most<00:01:04.869> of<00:01:05.019> the

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:05.110 
the knowledge as as a group most of the

00:01:05.110 --> 00:01:06.870 
the knowledge as as a group most of the
time<00:01:05.320> it's<00:01:05.560> it's<00:01:05.979> good<00:01:06.189> because<00:01:06.400> you<00:01:06.580> don't

00:01:06.870 --> 00:01:06.880 
time it's it's good because you don't

00:01:06.880 --> 00:01:08.210 
time it's it's good because you don't
have<00:01:06.970> someone<00:01:07.330> standing<00:01:07.720> over<00:01:07.810> your<00:01:07.960> shoulder

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:08.220 
have someone standing over your shoulder

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:11.190 
have someone standing over your shoulder
and<00:01:09.220> saying<00:01:09.430> oh<00:01:09.640> well<00:01:10.240> you<00:01:10.540> shouldn't<00:01:10.930> go<00:01:11.050> this

00:01:11.190 --> 00:01:11.200 
and saying oh well you shouldn't go this

00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:14.360 
and saying oh well you shouldn't go this
way<00:01:11.470> like<00:01:11.860> you<00:01:12.010> should<00:01:12.190> go<00:01:12.250> to<00:01:12.310> that<00:01:12.550> website

00:01:14.360 --> 00:01:14.370 
way like you should go to that website

00:01:14.370 --> 00:01:17.760 
way like you should go to that website
you're<00:01:15.370> not<00:01:15.670> just<00:01:16.000> you<00:01:16.450> know<00:01:16.570> skill<00:01:17.260> building

00:01:17.760 --> 00:01:17.770 
you're not just you know skill building

00:01:17.770 --> 00:01:19.649 
you're not just you know skill building
but<00:01:18.160> you're<00:01:18.520> also<00:01:18.730> building<00:01:19.240> on<00:01:19.540> your

00:01:19.649 --> 00:01:19.659 
but you're also building on your

00:01:19.659 --> 00:01:23.460 
but you're also building on your
collaboration<00:01:20.620> skills<00:01:21.100> you're<00:01:21.820> building<00:01:22.690> on

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:23.470 
collaboration skills you're building on

00:01:23.470 --> 00:01:25.740 
collaboration skills you're building on
your<00:01:24.070> critical<00:01:24.460> thinking<00:01:24.520> skills<00:01:24.880> because

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:25.750 
your critical thinking skills because

00:01:25.750 --> 00:01:27.899 
your critical thinking skills because
you<00:01:25.780> you<00:01:26.350> discuss<00:01:26.800> a<00:01:26.980> lot<00:01:27.190> with<00:01:27.490> your<00:01:27.670> groups

00:01:27.899 --> 00:01:27.909 
you you discuss a lot with your groups

00:01:27.909 --> 00:01:32.190 
you you discuss a lot with your groups
and<00:01:28.230> that<00:01:29.230> in<00:01:29.980> itself<00:01:30.400> I<00:01:30.640> think<00:01:30.880> helps<00:01:31.540> build

00:01:32.190 --> 00:01:32.200 
and that in itself I think helps build

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:34.620 
and that in itself I think helps build
the<00:01:32.350> foundation<00:01:33.040> skills<00:01:33.370> I<00:01:33.729> would<00:01:34.150> say<00:01:34.420> that

00:01:34.620 --> 00:01:34.630 
the foundation skills I would say that

00:01:34.630 --> 00:01:37.050 
the foundation skills I would say that
middle<00:01:35.290> school<00:01:35.620> is<00:01:35.800> a<00:01:35.830> microcosm<00:01:36.430> of<00:01:36.700> the<00:01:36.760> rest

00:01:37.050 --> 00:01:37.060 
middle school is a microcosm of the rest

00:01:37.060 --> 00:01:38.700 
middle school is a microcosm of the rest
of<00:01:37.210> our<00:01:37.300> lives<00:01:37.479> because<00:01:38.050> they're<00:01:38.560> dealing

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:38.710 
of our lives because they're dealing

00:01:38.710 --> 00:01:42.600 
of our lives because they're dealing
with<00:01:39.010> all<00:01:39.370> of<00:01:39.729> the<00:01:39.940> emotional<00:01:40.840> things<00:01:41.080> that<00:01:41.830> we

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:42.610 
with all of the emotional things that we

00:01:42.610 --> 00:01:45.180 
with all of the emotional things that we
deal<00:01:42.820> with<00:01:42.850> as<00:01:43.270> adults<00:01:43.780> but<00:01:44.020> not<00:01:44.290> without<00:01:44.979> the

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:45.190 
deal with as adults but not without the

00:01:45.190 --> 00:01:46.830 
deal with as adults but not without the
tools<00:01:45.400> I<00:01:45.790> think<00:01:45.970> that<00:01:46.360> one<00:01:46.510> of<00:01:46.600> the<00:01:46.659> things

00:01:46.830 --> 00:01:46.840 
tools I think that one of the things

00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:49.440 
tools I think that one of the things
that<00:01:46.960> I<00:01:47.190> Drive<00:01:48.190> to<00:01:48.520> do<00:01:48.610> as<00:01:48.729> a<00:01:48.760> teacher<00:01:49.030> is<00:01:49.270> that

00:01:49.440 --> 00:01:49.450 
that I Drive to do as a teacher is that

00:01:49.450 --> 00:01:53.280 
that I Drive to do as a teacher is that
I<00:01:49.500> establish<00:01:50.500> a<00:01:50.790> relationship<00:01:51.790> of<00:01:52.270> trust<00:01:52.720> with

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:53.290 
I establish a relationship of trust with

00:01:53.290 --> 00:01:56.430 
I establish a relationship of trust with
every<00:01:53.740> student<00:01:53.950> in<00:01:54.220> that<00:01:54.250> class<00:01:55.440> learning

00:01:56.430 --> 00:01:56.440 
every student in that class learning

00:01:56.440 --> 00:01:58.760 
every student in that class learning
can't<00:01:56.740> happen<00:01:56.920> until<00:01:57.250> Trust<00:01:57.909> is<00:01:58.120> there

00:01:58.760 --> 00:01:58.770 
can't happen until Trust is there

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:01.020 
can't happen until Trust is there
particularly<00:01:59.770> the<00:02:00.310> kind<00:02:00.490> of<00:02:00.580> challenging

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:01.030 
particularly the kind of challenging

00:02:01.030 --> 00:02:03.539 
particularly the kind of challenging
learning<00:02:01.119> that<00:02:01.420> we<00:02:01.510> often<00:02:01.840> do<00:02:02.280> they<00:02:03.280> have<00:02:03.430> to

00:02:03.539 --> 00:02:03.549 
learning that we often do they have to

00:02:03.549 --> 00:02:05.160 
learning that we often do they have to
talk<00:02:03.729> about<00:02:04.030> how<00:02:04.420> they<00:02:04.540> feel<00:02:04.570> about<00:02:04.960> things

00:02:05.160 --> 00:02:05.170 
talk about how they feel about things

00:02:05.170 --> 00:02:07.020 
talk about how they feel about things
and<00:02:05.560> if<00:02:05.770> they're<00:02:05.890> not<00:02:05.920> honest<00:02:06.369> then<00:02:06.880> they're

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:07.030 
and if they're not honest then they're

00:02:07.030 --> 00:02:09.059 
and if they're not honest then they're
not<00:02:07.150> moving<00:02:07.570> forward

00:02:09.059 --> 00:02:09.069 
not moving forward

00:02:09.069 --> 00:02:12.360 
not moving forward
and<00:02:09.299> particularly<00:02:10.299> in<00:02:10.659> adolescence<00:02:11.189> the<00:02:12.189> most

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:12.370 
and particularly in adolescence the most

00:02:12.370 --> 00:02:14.160 
and particularly in adolescence the most
important<00:02:12.879> thing<00:02:13.060> is<00:02:13.239> that<00:02:13.450> their<00:02:13.629> voice<00:02:13.930> be

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:14.170 
important thing is that their voice be

00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:17.699 
important thing is that their voice be
heard<00:02:14.579> as<00:02:15.579> an<00:02:15.879> English<00:02:16.269> teacher<00:02:16.709> the

00:02:17.699 --> 00:02:17.709 
heard as an English teacher the

00:02:17.709 --> 00:02:19.789 
heard as an English teacher the
development<00:02:18.189> of<00:02:18.280> voice<00:02:18.400> for<00:02:18.760> me<00:02:18.909> is

00:02:19.789 --> 00:02:19.799 
development of voice for me is

00:02:19.799 --> 00:02:22.470 
development of voice for me is
fundamentally<00:02:20.799> important<00:02:21.280> as<00:02:21.430> a<00:02:21.459> writer<00:02:21.790> but

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:22.480 
fundamentally important as a writer but

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:24.869 
fundamentally important as a writer but
also<00:02:22.689> really<00:02:23.260> important<00:02:23.829> as<00:02:23.920> a<00:02:23.950> person<00:02:24.459> again

00:02:24.869 --> 00:02:24.879 
also really important as a person again

00:02:24.879 --> 00:02:26.550 
also really important as a person again
it's<00:02:25.060> one<00:02:25.239> of<00:02:25.269> those<00:02:25.480> sort<00:02:25.870> of<00:02:25.959> things<00:02:26.260> where

00:02:26.550 --> 00:02:26.560 
it's one of those sort of things where

00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:28.830 
it's one of those sort of things where
there's<00:02:27.219> a<00:02:27.280> skill<00:02:27.939> involved<00:02:28.510> but<00:02:28.629> there's

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:28.840 
there's a skill involved but there's

00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:30.929 
there's a skill involved but there's
also<00:02:28.989> an<00:02:29.230> emotional<00:02:29.469> growth<00:02:30.010> thing<00:02:30.370> involved

00:02:30.929 --> 00:02:30.939 
also an emotional growth thing involved

00:02:30.939 --> 00:02:34.289 
also an emotional growth thing involved
