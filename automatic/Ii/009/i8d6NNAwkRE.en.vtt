what<00:00:12.750> I<00:00:12.780> like<00:00:13.049> about<00:00:13.080> this<00:00:13.469> kitchen<00:00:13.920> is<00:00:14.040> the

00:00:14.660 --> 00:00:14.670 
what I like about this kitchen is the

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:16.340 
what I like about this kitchen is the
way<00:00:14.820> you've<00:00:15.059> combined<00:00:15.540> very<00:00:15.780> traditional

00:00:16.340 --> 00:00:16.350 
way you've combined very traditional

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:18.290 
way you've combined very traditional
materials<00:00:16.920> but<00:00:17.760> others<00:00:18.060> that<00:00:18.180> are<00:00:18.270> more

00:00:18.290 --> 00:00:18.300 
materials but others that are more

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:20.240 
materials but others that are more
contemporary<00:00:19.020> so<00:00:19.619> in<00:00:19.890> terms<00:00:20.100> of<00:00:20.189> the

00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:20.250 
contemporary so in terms of the

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:21.439 
contemporary so in terms of the
materials<00:00:20.640> what<00:00:20.730> was<00:00:20.850> your<00:00:20.939> starting<00:00:21.330> point

00:00:21.439 --> 00:00:21.449 
materials what was your starting point

00:00:21.449 --> 00:00:22.759 
materials what was your starting point
you<00:00:21.689> start<00:00:21.960> with<00:00:22.080> traditional<00:00:22.590> or

00:00:22.759 --> 00:00:22.769 
you start with traditional or

00:00:22.769 --> 00:00:24.859 
you start with traditional or
contemporary<00:00:22.980> you<00:00:23.910> know<00:00:24.029> I<00:00:24.060> I'm<00:00:24.600> not<00:00:24.840> sure

00:00:24.859 --> 00:00:24.869 
contemporary you know I I'm not sure

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:27.320 
contemporary you know I I'm not sure
that<00:00:25.170> there<00:00:25.590> was<00:00:25.710> ever<00:00:25.890> an<00:00:26.340> exact<00:00:26.820> starting

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:27.330 
that there was ever an exact starting

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:31.070 
that there was ever an exact starting
point<00:00:27.599> I<00:00:28.349> think<00:00:28.830> in<00:00:29.160> InDesign<00:00:29.970> it<00:00:30.720> sort<00:00:30.990> of

00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:31.080 
point I think in InDesign it sort of

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:34.160 
point I think in InDesign it sort of
evolves<00:00:32.149> simultaneously<00:00:33.149> this<00:00:33.570> was<00:00:33.780> a<00:00:33.809> client

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:34.170 
evolves simultaneously this was a client

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:37.700 
evolves simultaneously this was a client
that<00:00:34.590> didn't<00:00:34.980> have<00:00:35.250> a<00:00:36.090> firm<00:00:36.840> direction<00:00:37.440> and

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:37.710 
that didn't have a firm direction and

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:41.330 
that didn't have a firm direction and
what<00:00:38.190> we<00:00:38.340> tried<00:00:38.640> to<00:00:38.670> create<00:00:39.120> was<00:00:40.129> texture<00:00:41.129> and

00:00:41.330 --> 00:00:41.340 
what we tried to create was texture and

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:45.080 
what we tried to create was texture and
dimension<00:00:41.579> and<00:00:42.180> interest<00:00:42.690> and<00:00:43.610> we<00:00:44.610> do<00:00:44.760> feel

00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:45.090 
dimension and interest and we do feel

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:48.200 
dimension and interest and we do feel
that<00:00:45.420> the<00:00:45.600> combination<00:00:46.469> of<00:00:46.710> those<00:00:46.920> two<00:00:46.980> in<00:00:47.820> a

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:48.210 
that the combination of those two in a

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:50.600 
that the combination of those two in a
thoughtful<00:00:48.500> well-balanced<00:00:49.500> way<00:00:49.770> is<00:00:50.129> very

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:50.610 
thoughtful well-balanced way is very

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:52.420 
thoughtful well-balanced way is very
interesting<00:00:51.270> so<00:00:51.570> there<00:00:51.719> isn't<00:00:51.870> really<00:00:52.199> a

00:00:52.420 --> 00:00:52.430 
interesting so there isn't really a

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:57.740 
interesting so there isn't really a
formula<00:00:53.430> it<00:00:53.969> is<00:00:54.300> a<00:00:55.250> collaboration<00:00:56.250> of<00:00:56.699> how<00:00:57.570> it

00:00:57.740 --> 00:00:57.750 
formula it is a collaboration of how it

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:00.080 
formula it is a collaboration of how it
feels<00:00:57.930> and<00:00:58.379> how<00:00:59.100> many<00:00:59.309> of<00:00:59.460> the<00:00:59.579> materials

00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:00.090 
feels and how many of the materials

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:02.119 
feels and how many of the materials
together<00:01:00.300> you<00:01:01.140> talk<00:01:01.289> about<00:01:01.410> texture<00:01:01.949> there

00:01:02.119 --> 00:01:02.129 
together you talk about texture there

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:04.009 
together you talk about texture there
and<00:01:02.460> one<00:01:02.760> of<00:01:02.879> the<00:01:02.969> elements<00:01:03.390> that<00:01:03.420> a<00:01:03.629> lot<00:01:03.899> of

00:01:04.009 --> 00:01:04.019 
and one of the elements that a lot of

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:07.070 
and one of the elements that a lot of
texts<00:01:04.350> are<00:01:04.470> the<00:01:04.680> wooden<00:01:05.339> ceiling<00:01:05.820> beams<00:01:06.080> how

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:07.080 
texts are the wooden ceiling beams how

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:08.510 
texts are the wooden ceiling beams how
did<00:01:07.229> you<00:01:07.290> manage<00:01:07.530> to<00:01:07.560> incorporate<00:01:08.040> those<00:01:08.220> but

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:08.520 
did you manage to incorporate those but

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:11.270 
did you manage to incorporate those but
this<00:01:08.640> is<00:01:08.790> originally<00:01:09.330> a<00:01:09.360> 1970s<00:01:10.350> ranch-style

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:11.280 
this is originally a 1970s ranch-style

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:14.570 
this is originally a 1970s ranch-style
house<00:01:11.760> yes<00:01:12.560> one<00:01:13.560> of<00:01:13.590> the<00:01:13.830> wonderful<00:01:14.189> things

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:14.580 
house yes one of the wonderful things

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:17.660 
house yes one of the wonderful things
about<00:01:14.700> this<00:01:15.150> design<00:01:15.689> is<00:01:16.110> is<00:01:16.500> how<00:01:16.950> we<00:01:17.009> were<00:01:17.310> I

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:17.670 
about this design is is how we were I

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:21.190 
about this design is is how we were I
think<00:01:17.880> able<00:01:18.570> to<00:01:18.750> transform<00:01:19.590> a<00:01:19.740> very<00:01:20.040> enclosed

00:01:21.190 --> 00:01:21.200 
think able to transform a very enclosed

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:25.010 
think able to transform a very enclosed
compartmentalized<00:01:22.200> home<00:01:23.159> and<00:01:23.720> use<00:01:24.720> different

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:25.020 
compartmentalized home and use different

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:27.530 
compartmentalized home and use different
elements<00:01:25.770> to<00:01:25.950> expand<00:01:26.460> the<00:01:26.610> view<00:01:26.820> and<00:01:27.210> kind<00:01:27.450> of

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:27.540 
elements to expand the view and kind of

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:30.380 
elements to expand the view and kind of
open<00:01:27.900> it<00:01:28.020> up<00:01:28.140> and<00:01:28.290> let<00:01:28.409> it<00:01:28.439> breathe<00:01:28.710> and<00:01:29.390> and

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:30.390 
open it up and let it breathe and and

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:34.130 
open it up and let it breathe and and
and<00:01:30.630> then<00:01:30.780> also<00:01:30.960> bring<00:01:31.590> the<00:01:31.920> nature<00:01:32.479> inside<00:01:33.479> so

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:34.140 
and then also bring the nature inside so

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:36.469 
and then also bring the nature inside so
what<00:01:34.350> better<00:01:34.530> way<00:01:34.890> and<00:01:35.460> to<00:01:35.909> do<00:01:36.090> it<00:01:36.240> with

00:01:36.469 --> 00:01:36.479 
what better way and to do it with

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:39.580 
what better way and to do it with
natural<00:01:36.720> elements<00:01:37.530> and<00:01:37.710> then<00:01:38.189> we<00:01:38.520> love<00:01:38.759> the

00:01:39.580 --> 00:01:39.590 
natural elements and then we love the

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:42.440 
natural elements and then we love the
context<00:01:40.590> of<00:01:40.740> it<00:01:40.920> in<00:01:41.130> the<00:01:41.220> midst<00:01:41.610> of<00:01:41.729> the<00:01:42.060> smooth

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:42.450 
context of it in the midst of the smooth

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:45.440 
context of it in the midst of the smooth
marble<00:01:43.380> and<00:01:43.860> then<00:01:44.100> the<00:01:44.220> very<00:01:44.460> the<00:01:45.210> more

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:45.450 
marble and then the very the more

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:47.330 
marble and then the very the more
traditional<00:01:46.020> cabinetry<00:01:46.590> and<00:01:46.890> then<00:01:47.100> also

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:47.340 
traditional cabinetry and then also

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:51.020 
traditional cabinetry and then also
those<00:01:47.729> the<00:01:48.210> beams<00:01:48.799> with<00:01:49.799> the<00:01:49.920> lighting<00:01:50.340> opened

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:51.030 
those the beams with the lighting opened

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:54.080 
those the beams with the lighting opened
up<00:01:51.149> that<00:01:51.270> feeling<00:01:51.780> so<00:01:52.110> we<00:01:52.979> opened<00:01:53.340> up<00:01:53.430> the<00:01:53.610> view

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:54.090 
up that feeling so we opened up the view

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:56.120 
up that feeling so we opened up the view
and<00:01:54.450> then<00:01:54.780> opened<00:01:55.200> up<00:01:55.290> the<00:01:55.470> volume<00:01:55.890> a<00:01:56.009> little

00:01:56.120 --> 00:01:56.130 
and then opened up the volume a little

00:01:56.130 --> 00:01:59.090 
and then opened up the volume a little
bit<00:01:56.280> and<00:01:57.000> using<00:01:57.689> the<00:01:57.990> texture<00:01:58.380> and<00:01:58.710> again<00:01:58.950> the

00:01:59.090 --> 00:01:59.100 
bit and using the texture and again the

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:03.750 
bit and using the texture and again the
similar<00:01:59.729> language<00:02:00.450> of<00:02:00.780> the<00:02:01.740> organic<00:02:02.250> and<00:02:02.490> the

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:03.760 
similar language of the organic and the

00:02:03.760 --> 00:02:05.990 
similar language of the organic and the
so<00:02:04.330> the<00:02:04.450> wood<00:02:04.900> in<00:02:05.050> the<00:02:05.140> stone<00:02:05.410> provide

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:06.000 
so the wood in the stone provide

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:09.120 
so the wood in the stone provide
textured<00:02:07.000> uneven<00:02:07.600> surfaces<00:02:08.140> have<00:02:08.680> you<00:02:08.950> then

00:02:09.120 --> 00:02:09.130 
textured uneven surfaces have you then

00:02:09.130 --> 00:02:11.190 
textured uneven surfaces have you then
contrasted<00:02:09.970> them<00:02:10.180> with<00:02:10.390> the<00:02:10.510> smooth<00:02:11.020> and

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:11.200 
contrasted them with the smooth and

00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:13.350 
contrasted them with the smooth and
modern<00:02:11.380> materials<00:02:12.010> and<00:02:12.190> design<00:02:12.400> features<00:02:12.850> you

00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:13.360 
modern materials and design features you

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:16.350 
modern materials and design features you
know<00:02:13.510> we<00:02:13.930> so<00:02:14.230> believes<00:02:14.890> if<00:02:15.220> the<00:02:15.520> entire<00:02:15.880> space

00:02:16.350 --> 00:02:16.360 
know we so believes if the entire space

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:18.900 
know we so believes if the entire space
is<00:02:16.420> smooth<00:02:17.020> you<00:02:17.560> stop<00:02:17.830> seeing<00:02:18.130> the<00:02:18.250> smooth<00:02:18.640> and

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:18.910 
is smooth you stop seeing the smooth and

00:02:18.910 --> 00:02:21.900 
is smooth you stop seeing the smooth and
so<00:02:19.480> by<00:02:19.660> bringing<00:02:19.900> in<00:02:20.260> the<00:02:20.680> contrast<00:02:21.550> of<00:02:21.760> the

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:21.910

more it provides visual interest to
provide<00:02:31.960> depth<00:02:32.410> and<00:02:32.860> if<00:02:33.520> the<00:02:33.730> smooth<00:02:34.060> is<00:02:34.300> left

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:34.630 
provide depth and if the smooth is left

on<00:02:34.840> its<00:02:34.990> own<00:02:35.200> it<00:02:36.190> becomes<00:02:36.850> a<00:02:37.030> little<00:02:37.420> bit<00:02:37.600> of<00:02:38.440> a

on its own it becomes a little bit of a

00:02:38.620 --> 00:02:41.010 
on its own it becomes a little bit of a
blank<00:02:38.920> slate<00:02:39.250> so<00:02:39.820> when<00:02:40.210> we<00:02:40.330> brought<00:02:40.540> the<00:02:40.720> stone

the<00:02:45.360> stone<00:02:46.360> really<00:02:46.750> became<00:02:47.410> much<00:02:47.950> more<00:02:48.190> alive

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:48.490 
the stone really became much more alive
