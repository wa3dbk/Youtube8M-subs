00:00:51.369 --> 00:00:51.379 
I'm doing with my two tweezers i isolate

00:00:51.379 --> 00:00:54.250 
I'm doing with my two tweezers i isolate
one<00:00:51.590> natural<00:00:52.040> lash<00:00:52.220> and<00:00:53.150> I<00:00:53.300> go<00:00:53.510> in<00:00:53.690> and<00:00:53.960> I<00:00:54.019> pick

00:00:54.250 --> 00:00:54.260 
one natural lash and I go in and I pick

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:57.310 
one natural lash and I go in and I pick
up<00:00:54.379> my<00:00:54.440> extension<00:00:55.280> that<00:00:56.090> gets<00:00:56.330> coated<00:00:56.600> in<00:00:56.930> glue

00:00:57.310 --> 00:00:57.320 
up my extension that gets coated in glue

00:00:57.320 --> 00:01:00.100 
up my extension that gets coated in glue
I<00:00:57.909> bring<00:00:58.909> that<00:00:59.059> over<00:00:59.210> to<00:00:59.449> the<00:00:59.540> natural<00:00:59.930> lash

00:01:00.100 --> 00:01:00.110 
I bring that over to the natural lash

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:01.960 
I bring that over to the natural lash
and<00:01:00.500> let<00:01:00.650> that<00:01:00.800> sit<00:01:01.129> there<00:01:01.159> for<00:01:01.370> a<00:01:01.640> couple<00:01:01.670> of

00:01:01.960 --> 00:01:01.970 
and let that sit there for a couple of

00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:07.330 
and let that sit there for a couple of
seconds<00:01:03.850> why<00:01:04.850> do<00:01:05.120> is<00:01:05.239> crazy<00:01:05.570> frame<00:01:06.080> and<00:01:06.860> then<00:01:07.250> I

00:01:07.330 --> 00:01:07.340 
seconds why do is crazy frame and then I

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:09.399 
seconds why do is crazy frame and then I
fill<00:01:07.640> in<00:01:07.790> that<00:01:07.940> frame<00:01:08.299> so<00:01:08.750> then<00:01:08.960> we<00:01:09.080> get<00:01:09.200> the

00:01:09.399 --> 00:01:09.409 
fill in that frame so then we get the

00:01:09.409 --> 00:01:17.219 
fill in that frame so then we get the
volume<00:01:10.070> and<00:01:10.400> the<00:01:10.490> thickness

00:01:17.219 --> 00:01:17.229 

00:01:17.229 --> 00:01:19.649 

so<00:01:17.770> a<00:01:17.799> full<00:01:18.130> lash<00:01:18.369> cycle<00:01:18.880> is<00:01:18.969> about<00:01:19.030> five<00:01:19.450> to

00:01:19.649 --> 00:01:19.659 
so a full lash cycle is about five to

00:01:19.659 --> 00:01:23.490 
so a full lash cycle is about five to
six<00:01:19.869> weeks<00:01:20.579> so<00:01:21.579> the<00:01:22.390> loss<00:01:22.570> of<00:01:22.750> the<00:01:22.869> extensions

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:23.500 
six weeks so the loss of the extensions

00:01:23.500 --> 00:01:27.070 
six weeks so the loss of the extensions
will<00:01:23.649> be<00:01:23.740> falling<00:01:24.039> hours<00:01:24.340> around<00:01:24.610> that<00:01:24.759> time

00:01:27.070 --> 00:01:27.080 

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:29.920 

so<00:01:27.770> on<00:01:28.010> Jamie<00:01:28.490> we're<00:01:28.700> doing<00:01:28.940> a<00:01:29.000> partial<00:01:29.270> set

00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:29.930 
so on Jamie we're doing a partial set

00:01:29.930 --> 00:01:32.590 
so on Jamie we're doing a partial set
we're<00:01:30.860> going<00:01:30.950> to<00:01:31.040> fan<00:01:31.340> out<00:01:31.580> words<00:01:32.000> on<00:01:32.270> the<00:01:32.390> edge

00:01:32.590 --> 00:01:32.600 
we're going to fan out words on the edge

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:35.290 
we're going to fan out words on the edge
of<00:01:32.810> the<00:01:32.930> lashes<00:01:33.170> and<00:01:33.710> fade<00:01:34.100> in<00:01:34.370> words<00:01:34.610> and<00:01:34.910> that

00:01:35.290 --> 00:01:35.300 
of the lashes and fade in words and that

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:37.030 
of the lashes and fade in words and that
way<00:01:35.480> we<00:01:35.690> get<00:01:35.870> like<00:01:36.080> a<00:01:36.110> nice<00:01:36.320> kind<00:01:36.530> of<00:01:36.650> cat<00:01:36.890> eye

00:01:37.030 --> 00:01:37.040 
way we get like a nice kind of cat eye

00:01:37.040 --> 00:01:42.890 
way we get like a nice kind of cat eye
shape

00:01:42.890 --> 00:01:42.900 

00:01:42.900 --> 00:01:45.560 

I<00:01:43.400> thought<00:01:44.400> this<00:01:44.610> was<00:01:44.850> gonna<00:01:45.000> be<00:01:45.090> more<00:01:45.420> like

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:45.570 
I thought this was gonna be more like

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:47.210 
I thought this was gonna be more like
going<00:01:45.810> to<00:01:45.840> the<00:01:46.050> dentist<00:01:46.230> but<00:01:46.830> it's<00:01:46.980> very

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:47.220 
going to the dentist but it's very

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:49.520 
going to the dentist but it's very
relaxing<00:01:48.000> here<00:01:48.300> and<00:01:48.480> I<00:01:48.540> feel<00:01:48.810> almost<00:01:49.050> like<00:01:49.290> I'm

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:49.530 
relaxing here and I feel almost like I'm

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:54.650 
relaxing here and I feel almost like I'm
getting<00:01:49.800> massaged<00:01:53.540> throughout<00:01:54.540> the

00:01:54.650 --> 00:01:54.660 
getting massaged throughout the

00:01:54.660 --> 00:01:56.360 
getting massaged throughout the
treatment<00:01:54.930> I<00:01:55.170> use<00:01:55.290> my<00:01:55.440> little<00:01:55.590> app<00:01:55.800> up<00:01:56.040> for<00:01:56.280> my

00:01:56.360 --> 00:01:56.370 
treatment I use my little app up for my

00:01:56.370 --> 00:01:58.880 
treatment I use my little app up for my
eyelashes<00:01:57.060> or<00:01:57.360> just<00:01:58.170> to<00:01:58.290> blow<00:01:58.470> any<00:01:58.620> of<00:01:58.770> the

00:01:58.880 --> 00:01:58.890 
eyelashes or just to blow any of the

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:00.590 
eyelashes or just to blow any of the
extra<00:01:59.190> femurs<00:01:59.550> away<00:01:59.760> so<00:01:59.820> the<00:02:00.150> clients<00:02:00.480> eyes

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:00.600 
extra femurs away so the clients eyes

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:04.190 
extra femurs away so the clients eyes
don't<00:02:00.930> sting<00:02:02.090> so<00:02:03.090> I'm<00:02:03.150> just<00:02:03.360> making<00:02:03.540> sure<00:02:03.990> that

00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:04.200 
don't sting so I'm just making sure that
