have all the instruments to to pilot the

00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:26.670 
have all the instruments to to pilot the
plane<00:01:24.070> and<00:01:24.400> of<00:01:25.150> course<00:01:25.450> this<00:01:25.780> gives<00:01:26.110> you<00:01:26.320> it's

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:26.680 
plane and of course this gives you it's

00:01:26.680 --> 00:01:31.590 
plane and of course this gives you it's
not<00:01:26.950> the<00:01:28.290> the<00:01:29.290> original<00:01:30.280> instrument<00:01:30.760> its<00:01:31.000> its

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:31.600 
not the the original instrument its its

00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:34.980 
not the the original instrument its its
watch<00:01:31.990> so<00:01:32.680> instead<00:01:33.280> of<00:01:33.550> giving<00:01:33.970> you<00:01:34.330> for

00:01:34.980 --> 00:01:34.990 
watch so instead of giving you for

00:01:34.990 --> 00:01:36.990 
watch so instead of giving you for
instance<00:01:35.260> the<00:01:35.470> climb<00:01:35.710> it<00:01:35.980> gives<00:01:36.370> you<00:01:36.610> the

00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:47.220 
cater you have with the arrow the hour
and<00:01:44.350> then<00:01:45.100> at<00:01:45.760> the<00:01:45.970> nose<00:01:46.180> of<00:01:46.390> the<00:01:46.510> airplane<00:01:46.659> you

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:47.230 
and then at the nose of the airplane you

00:01:47.230 --> 00:01:50.040 
and then at the nose of the airplane you
have<00:01:47.409> the<00:01:47.530> minutes<00:01:48.300> so<00:01:49.300> this<00:01:49.540> is<00:01:49.659> the<00:01:49.780> first

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:50.050 
have the minutes so this is the first

00:01:50.050 --> 00:01:57.899 
have the minutes so this is the first
time<00:01:50.260> attic<00:01:50.590> with<00:01:50.890> instrumentation<00:01:56.370> and<00:01:57.370> this

00:01:57.899 --> 00:01:57.909 
time attic with instrumentation and this

00:01:57.909 --> 00:02:01.230 
time attic with instrumentation and this
is<00:01:58.030> by<00:01:58.690> the<00:01:58.720> way<00:01:58.960> this<00:01:59.110> is<00:01:59.290> this<00:02:00.010> is<00:02:00.220> that<00:02:00.550> the

00:02:01.230 --> 00:02:01.240 
is by the way this is this is that the

00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:04.860 
is by the way this is this is that the
first<00:02:01.750> 99<00:02:02.350> pieces<00:02:02.620> will<00:02:03.100> be<00:02:03.280> sold<00:02:03.940> as<00:02:04.180> a<00:02:04.540> set

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:04.870 
first 99 pieces will be sold as a set

00:02:04.870 --> 00:02:08.249 
first 99 pieces will be sold as a set
with<00:02:05.140> this<00:02:05.409> box<00:02:05.880> showing<00:02:06.880> as<00:02:07.180> if<00:02:07.540> it<00:02:07.720> was<00:02:07.930> a
