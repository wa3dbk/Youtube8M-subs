00:00:02.449 --> 00:00:06.690
 samsung lg hyundai you know it the 

00:00:05.190 --> 00:00:08.700
 most high-tech toys that we 

00:00:06.690 --> 00:00:09.960
 loving are made in korea 

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:11.130
 by Korean brands 

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:14.429
 but how is it going on inside 

00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:17.190
 of these incredible companies the french 

00:00:14.429 --> 00:00:19.710
 Eric surdej spent 10 years at lg he has 

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:20.760
 headed the french subsidiary of lg and they 

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:23.010
 today sign a book 

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:26.130
 they are crazy these korean a book to 

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:29.869
 him otherwise stuffed with anecdotes about 

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:29.869
 backstage of these Korean companies 

00:00:32.329 --> 00:00:37.140
 I think the anecdotal memory about 

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:38.850
 the most impressive form has been 

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:41.370
 my three and a half weeks of immersion 

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:44.969
 in a training camp 

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:47.520
 after going without words ie 

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:49.200
 in the top 400 or for three 

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:51.570
 weeks and a half in the cold of 

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:54.539
 the Korean winter at -15 I worked from 

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:56.850
 7:30 am to 9:30 pm on weekends 

00:00:54.539 --> 00:00:58.500
 and 23:30 the week with 

00:00:56.850 --> 00:01:00.600
 supervisors behind my back to be 

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:02.550
 sure I was learning that I'm restoring is 

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:05.159
 and with about twenty bodies and one 

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:06.630
 day and night and I counted all 

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:08.130
 evenings while lying in my all 

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:10.500
 small plastic room because 

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:12.299
 it was 3 I go was a stick like 

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:14.400
 a soldier for the number of days 

00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:17.700
 remaining cgt weighing a prisoner's life 

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:21.060
 and a life not far from them to Pau from 

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:22.860
 go out obviously but a life of little 

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:23.549
 moments to free the mind for 

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:25.680
 think about something else 

00:01:23.549 --> 00:01:27.270
 despite everything sometimes we know 

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:29.729
 Korean well partying then there he 

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:34.259
 get loose ie as soon as the appearance 

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:37.740
 factual is over when everything in the end 

00:01:34.259 --> 00:01:39.960
 of the day they will evacuate while speaking 

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:41.070
 singing and drinking a lot and when 

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:43.770
 we drink a lot as they have a 

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:45.270
 metabolism which globally makes them 

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:45.780
 to hold alcohol much less than 

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:49.140
 European 

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:51.960
 it's going very fast drifting 

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:53.460
 total and there we are witnessing scenes that 

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:55.020
 are sometimes unique that are 

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:57.030
 improbable that we could not have 

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:59.369
 imagine a few hours before is by 

00:01:57.030 --> 00:02:01.320
 against the morning everything is back in order 

00:01:59.369 --> 00:02:03.600
 and the friends of the day the friends of a 

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:05.310
 evening friends of a drink became 

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:07.060
 leaders who become rebels is 

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:08.619
 hard and hard 

00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:11.290
 then seen from France appears 

00:02:08.619 --> 00:02:13.239
 completely surreal is what 

00:02:11.290 --> 00:02:16.660
 that 's why, despite everything, 

00:02:13.239 --> 00:02:18.190
 success and in particular the commercial success 

00:02:16.660 --> 00:02:20.380
 Korean technology products 

00:02:18.190 --> 00:02:22.030
 today the real is the real success 

00:02:20.380 --> 00:02:25.569
 Korean companies and in particular 

00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:27.459
 alger was to invest a lot on 

00:02:25.569 --> 00:02:28.060
 innovations in terms of products and 

00:02:27.459 --> 00:02:30.760
 of solutions 

00:02:28.060 --> 00:02:32.620
 these innovations they have been they are 

00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:34.660
 will be appropriate by leaders 

00:02:32.620 --> 00:02:36.670
 who gave direction to a whole 

00:02:34.660 --> 00:02:40.239
 business and the great strength of 

00:02:36.670 --> 00:02:42.610
 koreans and and was in that direction 

00:02:40.239 --> 00:02:44.680
 to dissect all the tasks in terms 

00:02:42.610 --> 00:02:47.500
 of execution to control them in terms of 

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:49.420
 quality timing of success for that 

00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:51.849
 every part of the organization is 

00:02:49.420 --> 00:02:54.760
 contributing to the overall project and that 

00:02:51.849 --> 00:02:57.940
 actually achieves the 

00:02:54.760 --> 00:02:59.680
 speed performance compared to 

00:02:57.940 --> 00:03:01.030
 a control of the execution that are 

00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:03.430
 huge compared to businesses 

00:03:01.030 --> 00:03:04.959
 French nuance of all that is 

00:03:03.430 --> 00:03:07.900
 that these facts in a catch deficit 

00:03:04.959 --> 00:03:09.370
 in account of the human and that sometimes 

00:03:07.900 --> 00:03:10.930
 made human dramas drama 

00:03:09.370 --> 00:03:13.299
 family because people resist 

00:03:10.930 --> 00:03:15.850
 not always to this culture because of 

00:03:13.299 --> 00:03:16.930
 measurement and ranking on the plane 

00:03:15.850 --> 00:03:19.600
 technological one always wonders 

00:03:16.930 --> 00:03:23.560
 what is the share of innovation and the 

00:03:19.600 --> 00:03:26.560
 share of copies do the Koreans 

00:03:23.560 --> 00:03:29.200
 are always in the process of following the 

00:03:26.560 --> 00:03:32.019
 japanese or american apple etc 

00:03:29.200 --> 00:03:34.120
 what is the creativity behind 

00:03:32.019 --> 00:03:35.049
 I think now there are both for 

00:03:34.120 --> 00:03:37.000
 return to the race 

00:03:35.049 --> 00:03:38.530
 the Koreans have copied a lot and we 

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:39.910
 copy with their know-how in terms 

00:03:38.530 --> 00:03:41.560
 the execution team 

00:03:39.910 --> 00:03:43.690
 now companies have become 

00:03:41.560 --> 00:03:45.489
 relatively rich have cash flow have 

00:03:43.690 --> 00:03:47.930
 laboratory developments have 

00:03:45.489 --> 00:03:50.150
 researchers is a society like 

00:03:47.930 --> 00:03:51.950
 lg is there about 7 to 7 thousand researchers 

00:03:50.150 --> 00:03:53.870
 permanently seeking patents 

00:03:51.950 --> 00:03:56.269
 who drops them and so this is 

00:03:53.870 --> 00:03:58.579
 innovation and lyon sometimes they do not have 

00:03:56.269 --> 00:04:00.530
 he misses so he copies very quickly 

00:03:58.579 --> 00:04:03.079
 in terms of ability to copy fast 

00:04:00.530 --> 00:04:05.000
 executed but overall on the real 

00:04:03.079 --> 00:04:06.560
 technologies when we talk about screens 

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:08.659
 now when we talk about 

00:04:06.560 --> 00:04:09.500
 android technologies for example and 

00:04:08.659 --> 00:04:12.019
 associations 

00:04:09.500 --> 00:04:13.159
 we can leave out the 

00:04:12.019 --> 00:04:14.840
 does that the koreans really have 

00:04:13.159 --> 00:04:16.609
 innovate in these areas this is a small 

00:04:14.840 --> 00:04:18.169
 overview of this book there are still a lot 

00:04:16.609 --> 00:04:19.940
 of things to say we will receive 

00:04:18.169 --> 00:04:22.989
 soon with surdej on 01net tv 

00:04:19.940 --> 00:04:22.989
 to talk about it hi to all
