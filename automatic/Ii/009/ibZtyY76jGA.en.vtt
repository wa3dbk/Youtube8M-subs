00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:07.280 
girls let's let's take a look at this
carbon<00:00:04.980> z<00:00:05.160> yak<00:00:05.490> which<00:00:05.910> was<00:00:06.420> a<00:00:06.450> very<00:00:06.540> fun<00:00:07.020> plane

00:00:07.280 --> 00:00:07.290 
carbon z yak which was a very fun plane

00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:10.520 
carbon z yak which was a very fun plane
to<00:00:07.440> fly<00:00:07.649> and<00:00:07.890> I<00:00:07.950> actually<00:00:08.160> got<00:00:08.550> about<00:00:09.260> 40<00:00:10.260> to<00:00:10.380> 50

00:00:10.520 --> 00:00:10.530 
to fly and I actually got about 40 to 50

00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:12.860 
to fly and I actually got about 40 to 50
flights<00:00:10.980> on<00:00:11.219> it<00:00:11.460> um<00:00:11.880> had<00:00:12.240> a<00:00:12.269> couple<00:00:12.509> of<00:00:12.690> hard

00:00:12.860 --> 00:00:12.870 
flights on it um had a couple of hard

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:14.660 
flights on it um had a couple of hard
landings<00:00:13.380> here<00:00:13.620> in<00:00:13.710> the<00:00:13.830> air<00:00:14.009> and<00:00:14.250> you<00:00:14.549> know

00:00:14.660 --> 00:00:14.670 
landings here in the air and you know

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:16.939 
landings here in the air and you know
I'm<00:00:14.880> a<00:00:15.450> good<00:00:15.540> pilot<00:00:15.839> I<00:00:16.109> don't<00:00:16.260> fly<00:00:16.440> planes<00:00:16.770> into

00:00:16.939 --> 00:00:16.949 
I'm a good pilot I don't fly planes into

00:00:16.949 --> 00:00:18.500 
I'm a good pilot I don't fly planes into
the<00:00:17.070> ground<00:00:17.340> but<00:00:17.550> I'm<00:00:17.670> certainly<00:00:18.029> not<00:00:18.180> a<00:00:18.240> great

00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:18.510 
the ground but I'm certainly not a great

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:23.060 
the ground but I'm certainly not a great
pilot<00:00:20.210> so<00:00:21.210> I<00:00:21.240> you<00:00:21.779> know<00:00:21.810> had<00:00:22.710> some<00:00:22.740> minor

00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:23.070 
pilot so I you know had some minor

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:26.000 
pilot so I you know had some minor
repairs<00:00:23.460> I'm<00:00:24.210> Anna<00:00:24.449> sparred<00:00:24.900> the<00:00:25.050> piece<00:00:25.289> here

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:26.010 
repairs I'm Anna sparred the piece here

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:27.980 
repairs I'm Anna sparred the piece here
because<00:00:26.460> it<00:00:26.609> tends<00:00:27.119> to<00:00:27.210> crack<00:00:27.539> right<00:00:27.750> back

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:27.990 
because it tends to crack right back

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:30.320 
because it tends to crack right back
here<00:00:28.170> behind<00:00:28.349> the<00:00:28.619> canopy<00:00:29.099> which<00:00:29.699> is<00:00:29.880> fun<00:00:30.090> if

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:30.330 
here behind the canopy which is fun if

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:31.849 
here behind the canopy which is fun if
you<00:00:30.420> don't<00:00:30.539> come<00:00:30.750> in<00:00:30.900> for<00:00:31.080> a<00:00:31.109> hard<00:00:31.320> landing<00:00:31.410> but

00:00:31.849 --> 00:00:31.859 
you don't come in for a hard landing but

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:33.319 
you don't come in for a hard landing but
you<00:00:32.070> can<00:00:32.219> see<00:00:32.340> where<00:00:32.489> i<00:00:32.520> put<00:00:32.669> some<00:00:32.850> sparse<00:00:33.180> in

00:00:33.319 --> 00:00:33.329 
you can see where i put some sparse in

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:36.049 
you can see where i put some sparse in
here<00:00:33.840> and<00:00:34.020> this<00:00:34.590> will<00:00:34.800> probably<00:00:35.250> cause<00:00:35.880> II

00:00:36.049 --> 00:00:36.059 
here and this will probably cause II

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:37.610 
here and this will probably cause II
flight<00:00:36.329> to<00:00:36.510> say<00:00:36.690> well<00:00:36.930> we're<00:00:37.200> not<00:00:37.380> going<00:00:37.559> to

flight to say well we're not going to

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:40.549 
flight to say well we're not going to
warranty<00:00:38.160> your<00:00:38.309> plane<00:00:39.200> another<00:00:40.200> issue<00:00:40.410> that

00:00:40.549 --> 00:00:40.559 
warranty your plane another issue that

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:42.729 
warranty your plane another issue that
I'm<00:00:40.770> going<00:00:40.890> to<00:00:40.950> have<00:00:41.010> is<00:00:41.399> that<00:00:41.550> because<00:00:41.760> I

00:00:42.729 --> 00:00:42.739 
I'm going to have is that because I

00:00:42.739 --> 00:00:48.260 
I'm going to have is that because I
replaced<00:00:43.739> an<00:00:44.570> efl<00:00:45.570> our<00:00:46.370> 7140<00:00:47.370> the<00:00:47.700> servo<00:00:48.120> in

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:48.270 
replaced an efl our 7140 the servo in

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:52.520 
replaced an efl our 7140 the servo in
question<00:00:48.870> from<00:00:49.590> the<00:00:49.739> original<00:00:50.309> efl<00:00:50.969> are<00:00:51.530> 7140

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:52.530 
question from the original efl are 7140

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:56.869 
question from the original efl are 7140
with<00:00:53.190> the<00:00:53.370> long<00:00:53.520> lead<00:00:54.920> they<00:00:55.920> don't<00:00:56.129> cover

00:00:56.869 --> 00:00:56.879 
with the long lead they don't cover

00:00:56.879 --> 00:01:00.319 
with the long lead they don't cover
collateral<00:00:57.570> damage<00:00:58.050> and<00:00:58.320> so<00:00:58.710> now<00:00:59.640> my<00:00:59.879> four

00:01:00.319 --> 00:01:00.329 
collateral damage and so now my four

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:01.939 
collateral damage and so now my four
hundred<00:01:00.600> dollar<00:01:00.780> carbons<00:01:01.260> a<00:01:01.379> yak<00:01:01.649> is

hundred dollar carbons a yak is

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:04.670 
hundred dollar carbons a yak is
collateral<00:01:02.820> damage<00:01:03.270> because<00:01:03.719> of<00:01:04.019> their

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:04.680 
collateral damage because of their

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:07.550 
collateral damage because of their
recommended<00:01:05.309> replacement<00:01:06.240> part<00:01:06.570> for<00:01:06.869> this

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:07.560 
recommended replacement part for this

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:11.270 
recommended replacement part for this
play<00:01:08.360> so<00:01:09.360> let's<00:01:10.320> see<00:01:10.530> here<00:01:10.770> I've<00:01:10.920> got<00:01:10.950> this

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:11.280 
play so let's see here I've got this

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:14.300 
play so let's see here I've got this
hooked<00:01:11.520> up<00:01:11.850> to<00:01:12.240> the<00:01:12.780> rudder<00:01:13.470> just<00:01:13.890> so<00:01:14.010> we<00:01:14.159> won't

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:14.310 
hooked up to the rudder just so we won't

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:16.820 
hooked up to the rudder just so we won't
have<00:01:14.369> any<00:01:14.610> why<00:01:14.850> harness<00:01:15.350> questions<00:01:16.350> in<00:01:16.590> there

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:16.830 
have any why harness questions in there

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:19.520 
have any why harness questions in there
and<00:01:17.240> as<00:01:18.240> you<00:01:18.390> can<00:01:18.540> see<00:01:18.570> i'll<00:01:18.869> come<00:01:19.049> over<00:01:19.170> here

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:19.530 
and as you can see i'll come over here

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:24.320 
and as you can see i'll come over here
and<00:01:20.540> actuate<00:01:21.540> my<00:01:21.720> rudder<00:01:21.960> looks<00:01:22.350> good<00:01:23.150> this<00:01:24.150> is

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:24.330 
and actuate my rudder looks good this is

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:26.600 
and actuate my rudder looks good this is
the<00:01:24.479> original<00:01:24.570> one<00:01:25.140> that<00:01:25.170> i<00:01:25.380> stripped<00:01:25.830> on<00:01:26.040> a

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:26.610 
the original one that i stripped on a

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:28.399 
the original one that i stripped on a
hard<00:01:27.119> landing<00:01:27.630> and<00:01:27.780> I've<00:01:27.869> got<00:01:28.020> this<00:01:28.170> on

00:01:28.399 --> 00:01:28.409 
hard landing and I've got this on

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:30.770 
hard landing and I've got this on
elevator<00:01:29.159> I<00:01:29.250> believe<00:01:29.610> you<00:01:30.360> can<00:01:30.420> see<00:01:30.600> works

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:30.780 
elevator I believe you can see works

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:35.890 
elevator I believe you can see works
fine<00:01:30.990> that<00:01:31.320> way<00:01:32.960> that<00:01:33.960> way<00:01:34.159> stripped<00:01:35.159> gear

00:01:35.890 --> 00:01:35.900 
fine that way that way stripped gear

00:01:35.900 --> 00:01:38.870 
fine that way that way stripped gear
gears<00:01:36.900> are<00:01:37.049> out<00:01:37.170> of<00:01:37.290> stock<00:01:37.500> so<00:01:37.979> I<00:01:38.280> had<00:01:38.640> a<00:01:38.670> couple

00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:38.880 
gears are out of stock so I had a couple

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:42.950 
gears are out of stock so I had a couple
of<00:01:39.090> extra<00:01:40.049> efl<00:01:40.890> r71<00:01:41.460> 40s<00:01:42.030> that<00:01:42.299> I<00:01:42.450> bought<00:01:42.750> when

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:42.960 
of extra efl r71 40s that I bought when

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:47.240 
of extra efl r71 40s that I bought when
I<00:01:43.020> bought<00:01:43.200> the<00:01:43.380> plane<00:01:45.259> just<00:01:46.259> to<00:01:46.409> have<00:01:46.560> one<00:01:46.590> on

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:47.250 
I bought the plane just to have one on

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:49.490 
I bought the plane just to have one on
hand<00:01:47.280> so<00:01:48.119> I<00:01:48.450> installed<00:01:48.960> this<00:01:49.110> one<00:01:49.320> in<00:01:49.409> the

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:49.500 
hand so I installed this one in the

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:51.560 
hand so I installed this one in the
plane<00:01:49.710> with<00:01:49.740> recent<00:01:50.369> preflight<00:01:51.000> checks<00:01:51.329> it

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:51.570 
plane with recent preflight checks it

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:56.179 
plane with recent preflight checks it
looked<00:01:51.750> good<00:01:52.340> seemed<00:01:53.340> fine<00:01:53.610> but<00:01:54.509> then<00:01:54.689> I<00:01:55.189> got

00:01:56.179 --> 00:01:56.189 
looked good seemed fine but then I got

00:01:56.189 --> 00:01:57.200 
looked good seemed fine but then I got
the<00:01:56.340> field<00:01:56.549> and<00:01:56.670> went<00:01:56.820> through<00:01:57.000> another

00:01:57.200 --> 00:01:57.210 
the field and went through another

00:01:57.210 --> 00:01:59.840 
the field and went through another
pre-flight<00:01:58.079> check<00:01:58.380> and<00:01:58.680> it<00:01:59.189> started

00:01:59.840 --> 00:01:59.850 
pre-flight check and it started

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:04.280 
pre-flight check and it started
deflecting<00:02:00.680> full<00:02:01.680> deflection<00:02:02.990> this<00:02:03.990> is<00:02:04.140> the

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:04.290 
deflecting full deflection this is the

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:06.139 
deflecting full deflection this is the
aileron<00:02:04.740> service<00:02:05.219> that<00:02:05.399> I<00:02:05.460> was<00:02:05.579> replacing

00:02:06.139 --> 00:02:06.149 
aileron service that I was replacing

00:02:06.149 --> 00:02:10.100 
aileron service that I was replacing
obviously<00:02:06.689> so<00:02:07.590> I<00:02:07.860> took<00:02:08.129> my<00:02:08.399> other<00:02:08.580> spare<00:02:09.030> and<00:02:09.390> I

00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:10.110 
obviously so I took my other spare and I

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:11.420 
obviously so I took my other spare and I
put<00:02:10.289> it<00:02:10.410> in<00:02:10.470> there<00:02:10.709> and<00:02:10.950> I<00:02:11.009> went<00:02:11.190> through

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:11.430 
put it in there and I went through

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:13.580 
put it in there and I went through
about<00:02:11.519> 10<00:02:11.790> preflight<00:02:12.359> checks<00:02:12.719> everything

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:13.590 
about 10 preflight checks everything

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:16.250 
about 10 preflight checks everything
worked<00:02:13.980> fine<00:02:14.129> well<00:02:14.969> 20<00:02:15.569> seconds<00:02:15.959> into<00:02:16.079> the

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:21.530 
flight it went disastrously wrong you
can<00:02:19.049> see<00:02:19.319> just<00:02:19.620> a<00:02:20.549> little<00:02:20.790> tapping<00:02:21.269> on<00:02:21.390> this

00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:21.540

this case it's been suggested that this

this case it's been suggested that this

is an issue with the potentiometer and

00:03:28.380 --> 00:03:31.040 
is an issue with the potentiometer and
in<00:03:29.130> the<00:03:29.220> case<00:03:29.430> that<00:03:29.460> it's<00:03:29.850> in<00:03:30.060> and<00:03:30.630> being

in the case that it's in and being

in the case that it's in and being

brittle and not very well may be the

00:03:32.910 --> 00:03:35.360 
brittle and not very well may be the
case<00:03:33.120> I<00:03:33.480> thought<00:03:34.320> that<00:03:34.380> possibly<00:03:34.740> it<00:03:35.190> was<00:03:35.310> a

00:03:35.360 --> 00:03:35.370 
case I thought that possibly it was a

00:03:35.370 --> 00:03:39.530 
case I thought that possibly it was a
short<00:03:35.640> back<00:03:35.970> here<00:03:37.520> but<00:03:38.520> it's<00:03:38.910> really<00:03:39.210> hard<00:03:39.390> to

00:03:39.530 --> 00:03:39.540 
short back here but it's really hard to

00:03:39.540 --> 00:03:43.699 
short back here but it's really hard to
say<00:03:41.540> it's<00:03:42.540> not<00:03:42.690> supposed<00:03:42.990> to<00:03:43.110> do<00:03:43.230> that<00:03:43.260> though

00:03:43.699 --> 00:03:43.709 
say it's not supposed to do that though

00:03:43.709 --> 00:03:47.660 
say it's not supposed to do that though
so<00:03:44.330> eflite<00:03:45.330> y'all<00:03:46.140> and<00:03:46.410> horizon<00:03:47.160> y'all<00:03:47.370> y'all

that have gone into the ground because

00:03:59.810 --> 00:04:05.830 
that have gone into the ground because
you<00:04:00.810> put<00:04:01.020> a<00:04:02.540> poorly<00:04:03.540> manufactured<00:04:04.350> servo<00:04:05.190> in

you put a poorly manufactured servo in

you put a poorly manufactured servo in

what you say then offshoring is probably

00:04:17.340 --> 00:04:20.990 
what you say then offshoring is probably
made<00:04:17.609> up<00:04:17.790> for<00:04:18.450> in<00:04:18.900> quality<00:04:19.739> defects<00:04:20.520> and<00:04:20.850> this
