seeds in it and you don't want to do
that<00:01:26.409> likewise<00:01:27.400> when<00:01:27.610> you're<00:01:27.700> bringing<00:01:27.970> in

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:28.090 
that likewise when you're bringing in

that likewise when you're bringing in
compost<00:01:28.630> or<00:01:28.780> when<00:01:28.869> you're<00:01:28.990> composting<00:01:29.650> you

compost or when you're composting you

00:01:29.740 --> 00:01:31.679 
compost or when you're composting you
want<00:01:29.890> to<00:01:29.950> make<00:01:30.070> sure<00:01:30.189> you're<00:01:30.360> creating<00:01:31.360> a<00:01:31.420> hot

00:01:31.679 --> 00:01:31.689 
want to make sure you're creating a hot

00:01:31.689 --> 00:01:33.630 
want to make sure you're creating a hot
compost<00:01:32.020> pile<00:01:32.560> or<00:01:33.010> buying<00:01:33.189> really<00:01:33.430> good

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:33.640 
compost pile or buying really good

compost pile or buying really good
compost<00:01:34.060> where<00:01:34.240> most<00:01:34.479> of<00:01:34.600> those<00:01:34.689> weed<00:01:34.930> seeds

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:34.960 
compost where most of those weed seeds

00:01:34.960 --> 00:01:36.960 
compost where most of those weed seeds
will<00:01:35.409> have<00:01:35.500> been<00:01:35.619> killed<00:01:35.920> because<00:01:36.640> if<00:01:36.880> you

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:36.970 
will have been killed because if you

00:01:36.970 --> 00:01:39.179 
will have been killed because if you
spread<00:01:37.270> compost<00:01:37.540> that<00:01:37.990> has<00:01:38.049> we're<00:01:38.560> top<00:01:38.830> soil

00:01:39.179 --> 00:01:39.189 
spread compost that has we're top soil

00:01:39.189 --> 00:01:40.800 
spread compost that has we're top soil
that<00:01:39.280> has<00:01:39.430> horse<00:01:39.850> tail<00:01:40.180> in<00:01:40.360> it<00:01:40.450> or<00:01:40.540> something

00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:40.810 
that has horse tail in it or something

00:01:40.810 --> 00:01:41.940 
that has horse tail in it or something
like<00:01:40.840> that<00:01:40.960> you're<00:01:41.259> bringing<00:01:41.560> that<00:01:41.590> into<00:01:41.799> your

00:01:41.940 --> 00:01:41.950 
like that you're bringing that into your

00:01:41.950 --> 00:01:43.649 
like that you're bringing that into your
garden<00:01:42.130> it's<00:01:42.610> not<00:01:42.790> a<00:01:42.820> great<00:01:43.030> thing<00:01:43.270> so<00:01:43.479> that's

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:43.659 
garden it's not a great thing so that's

00:01:43.659 --> 00:01:45.480 
garden it's not a great thing so that's
number<00:01:43.810> one<00:01:44.080> is<00:01:44.259> try<00:01:44.409> to<00:01:44.470> be<00:01:44.560> clean<00:01:44.799> second

00:01:45.480 --> 00:01:45.490 
number one is try to be clean second

00:01:45.490 --> 00:01:47.340 
number one is try to be clean second
step<00:01:45.670> is<00:01:45.850> balancing<00:01:46.450> your<00:01:46.600> soil<00:01:46.960> fertility

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:47.350 
step is balancing your soil fertility

00:01:47.350 --> 00:01:49.200 
step is balancing your soil fertility
and<00:01:47.710> actually<00:01:48.369> that's<00:01:48.549> what<00:01:48.820> I<00:01:48.880> was<00:01:49.060> going<00:01:49.150> to

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:49.210 
and actually that's what I was going to

00:01:49.210 --> 00:01:50.789 
and actually that's what I was going to
bring<00:01:49.360> out<00:01:49.479> my<00:01:49.600> soil<00:01:49.840> test<00:01:50.110> for<00:01:50.320> I<00:01:50.350> remember

00:01:50.789 --> 00:01:50.799 
bring out my soil test for I remember

00:01:50.799 --> 00:01:52.350 
bring out my soil test for I remember
now<00:01:50.920> so<00:01:51.490> I'm<00:01:51.700> not<00:01:51.729> going<00:01:51.939> to<00:01:52.030> get<00:01:52.119> into<00:01:52.210> much

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:52.360 
now so I'm not going to get into much

00:01:52.360 --> 00:01:53.700 
now so I'm not going to get into much
detail<00:01:52.630> here<00:01:52.780> but<00:01:53.110> when<00:01:53.259> I<00:01:53.290> look<00:01:53.500> at<00:01:53.619> this

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:53.710 
detail here but when I look at this

00:01:53.710 --> 00:01:55.859 
detail here but when I look at this
organic<00:01:54.250> soil<00:01:54.490> test<00:01:54.759> results<00:01:54.939> I<00:01:55.299> can<00:01:55.750> look

00:01:55.859 --> 00:01:55.869 
organic soil test results I can look

00:01:55.869 --> 00:01:58.080 
organic soil test results I can look
especially<00:01:56.079> at<00:01:56.409> my<00:01:56.590> my<00:01:57.040> main<00:01:57.310> macronutrients

00:01:58.080 --> 00:01:58.090 
especially at my my main macronutrients

00:01:58.090 --> 00:01:59.399 
especially at my my main macronutrients
here<00:01:58.210> I<00:01:58.240> can<00:01:58.450> see<00:01:58.600> my<00:01:58.630> calcium<00:01:59.229> magnesium

00:01:59.399 --> 00:01:59.409 
here I can see my calcium magnesium

00:01:59.409 --> 00:02:02.310 
here I can see my calcium magnesium
potassium<00:01:59.860> sodium<00:02:00.759> those<00:02:01.570> are<00:02:01.750> all<00:02:01.900> a<00:02:01.930> little

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:02.320 
potassium sodium those are all a little

00:02:02.320 --> 00:02:04.429 
potassium sodium those are all a little
out<00:02:02.439> of<00:02:02.470> whack<00:02:02.590> which<00:02:03.009> is<00:02:03.130> certainly<00:02:03.520> common

00:02:04.429 --> 00:02:04.439 
out of whack which is certainly common

00:02:04.439 --> 00:02:07.260 
out of whack which is certainly common
but<00:02:05.439> if<00:02:05.560> we<00:02:05.710> can<00:02:05.860> balance<00:02:06.100> those<00:02:06.520> out<00:02:06.729> based<00:02:07.119> on

00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:07.270 
but if we can balance those out based on

00:02:07.270 --> 00:02:08.819 
but if we can balance those out based on
the<00:02:07.360> recommendations<00:02:08.049> from<00:02:08.170> a<00:02:08.319> good<00:02:08.530> organic

00:02:08.819 --> 00:02:08.829 
the recommendations from a good organic

the recommendations from a good organic

00:02:15.899 --> 00:02:15.909 
always going to kill the weeds but if

00:02:15.909 --> 00:02:17.159 
always going to kill the weeds but if
you<00:02:15.999> just<00:02:16.150> keep<00:02:16.299> doing<00:02:16.569> it<00:02:16.659> a<00:02:16.689> few<00:02:16.719> times<00:02:16.959> it's

00:02:17.159 --> 00:02:17.169 
you just keep doing it a few times it's

00:02:17.169 --> 00:02:18.390 
you just keep doing it a few times it's
going<00:02:17.290> to<00:02:17.349> weaken<00:02:17.680> them<00:02:17.799> and<00:02:17.950> eventually<00:02:18.279> they

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:18.400 
going to weaken them and eventually they

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:19.949 
going to weaken them and eventually they
won't<00:02:18.549> cause<00:02:18.730> that<00:02:18.909> much<00:02:19.029> problem<00:02:19.269> with<00:02:19.389> a<00:02:19.749> day

00:02:19.949 --> 00:02:19.959 
won't cause that much problem with a day

00:02:19.959 --> 00:02:20.650 
won't cause that much problem with a day
and<00:02:20.079> you

00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:20.660 
and you

00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:22.150 
and you
it's<00:02:21.080> nice<00:02:21.290> if<00:02:21.440> you<00:02:21.530> can<00:02:21.560> pull<00:02:21.830> it<00:02:21.920> up<00:02:22.010> by<00:02:22.040> the

00:02:22.150 --> 00:02:22.160 
it's nice if you can pull it up by the

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:24.310 
it's nice if you can pull it up by the
taproot<00:02:22.610> but<00:02:22.730> it<00:02:22.820> takes<00:02:23.000> so<00:02:23.240> long<00:02:23.480> now<00:02:23.960> for<00:02:24.020> me

00:02:24.310 --> 00:02:24.320 
taproot but it takes so long now for me

00:02:24.320 --> 00:02:26.170 
taproot but it takes so long now for me
personally<00:02:24.890> I<00:02:25.040> leave<00:02:25.670> most<00:02:25.910> of<00:02:26.090> the

00:02:26.170 --> 00:02:26.180 
personally I leave most of the

00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:27.640 
personally I leave most of the
dandelions<00:02:26.720> in<00:02:26.810> my<00:02:26.990> soil<00:02:27.260> because<00:02:27.500> I<00:02:27.590> know

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:27.650 
dandelions in my soil because I know

00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:29.140 
dandelions in my soil because I know
they're<00:02:28.100> doing<00:02:28.310> a<00:02:28.370> lot<00:02:28.520> of<00:02:28.550> good<00:02:28.730> work<00:02:28.880> there

00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:29.150 
they're doing a lot of good work there

00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:30.790 
they're doing a lot of good work there
but<00:02:29.570> if<00:02:29.660> I<00:02:29.750> did<00:02:29.900> want<00:02:30.080> to<00:02:30.140> get<00:02:30.260> rid<00:02:30.380> of<00:02:30.410> them<00:02:30.590> and

00:02:30.790 --> 00:02:30.800 
but if I did want to get rid of them and

00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:32.650 
but if I did want to get rid of them and
this<00:02:30.860> is<00:02:30.920> one-handed<00:02:31.610> I<00:02:31.760> would<00:02:32.330> just<00:02:32.450> take<00:02:32.600> a

00:02:32.650 --> 00:02:32.660 
this is one-handed I would just take a

00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:36.010 
this is one-handed I would just take a
hoe<00:02:32.870> and<00:02:34.270> boom<00:02:35.270> I<00:02:35.480> didn't<00:02:35.780> get<00:02:35.870> rid<00:02:35.960> of

00:02:36.010 --> 00:02:36.020 
hoe and boom I didn't get rid of

00:02:36.020 --> 00:02:37.420 
hoe and boom I didn't get rid of
everything<00:02:36.470> but<00:02:36.560> I<00:02:36.620> got<00:02:36.770> rid<00:02:36.920> of<00:02:36.950> a<00:02:37.040> lot<00:02:37.190> you

00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:37.430 
everything but I got rid of a lot you

00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:38.710 
everything but I got rid of a lot you
know<00:02:37.520> the<00:02:37.640> worms<00:02:37.790> like<00:02:38.030> to<00:02:38.150> hang<00:02:38.270> out<00:02:38.390> right<00:02:38.600> in

00:02:38.710 --> 00:02:38.720 
know the worms like to hang out right in

00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:40.630 
know the worms like to hang out right in
that<00:02:38.810> root<00:02:39.020> zone<00:02:39.260> of<00:02:39.410> a<00:02:39.470> weed<00:02:39.650> so<00:02:40.010> that's

00:02:40.630 --> 00:02:40.640 
that root zone of a weed so that's

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:41.770 
that root zone of a weed so that's
another<00:02:40.820> reason<00:02:41.030> weeds<00:02:41.300> are<00:02:41.450> good

00:02:41.770 --> 00:02:41.780 
another reason weeds are good

00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:43.270 
another reason weeds are good
next<00:02:42.500> how<00:02:42.620> am<00:02:42.710> I<00:02:42.740> going<00:02:42.860> to<00:02:42.950> stop<00:02:43.100> that

00:02:43.270 --> 00:02:43.280 
next how am I going to stop that

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:45.040 
next how am I going to stop that
dandelion<00:02:43.550> from<00:02:43.880> coming<00:02:44.150> up<00:02:44.270> again<00:02:44.570> well

00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:45.050 
dandelion from coming up again well

00:02:45.050 --> 00:02:46.720 
dandelion from coming up again well
dandelions<00:02:45.680> happen<00:02:45.950> to<00:02:46.010> be<00:02:46.100> pretty<00:02:46.340> strong

00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:46.730 
dandelions happen to be pretty strong

00:02:46.730 --> 00:02:48.490 
dandelions happen to be pretty strong
they'll<00:02:47.090> just<00:02:47.240> keep<00:02:47.420> coming<00:02:47.720> back<00:02:47.870> although<00:02:48.350> I

00:02:48.490 --> 00:02:48.500 
they'll just keep coming back although I

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:51.190 
they'll just keep coming back although I
you<00:02:48.620> can<00:02:48.920> weaken<00:02:49.250> them<00:02:49.370> over<00:02:49.580> time<00:02:49.760> but<00:02:50.480> the

00:02:51.190 --> 00:02:51.200 
you can weaken them over time but the

00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:55.500 
you can weaken them over time but the
next<00:02:51.470> step<00:02:51.650> to<00:02:52.600> controlling<00:02:53.600> weeds<00:02:53.780> is<00:02:54.280> boom

00:02:55.500 --> 00:02:55.510 
next step to controlling weeds is boom

00:02:55.510 --> 00:02:58.270 
next step to controlling weeds is boom
throw<00:02:56.510> a<00:02:56.570> nice<00:02:56.810> thick<00:02:57.080> mulch<00:02:57.410> on<00:02:57.590> their<00:02:57.890> leaves

00:02:58.270 --> 00:02:58.280 
throw a nice thick mulch on their leaves

00:02:58.280 --> 00:03:00.130 
throw a nice thick mulch on their leaves
or<00:02:58.580> straw<00:02:58.790> or<00:02:59.060> whatever<00:02:59.330> you<00:02:59.450> like<00:02:59.570> to<00:02:59.720> use<00:02:59.750> for

00:03:00.130 --> 00:03:00.140 
or straw or whatever you like to use for

00:03:00.140 --> 00:03:02.020 
or straw or whatever you like to use for
mulch<00:03:00.320> I've<00:03:00.530> talked<00:03:00.710> about<00:03:00.830> that<00:03:00.950> before<00:03:01.100> but

00:03:02.020 --> 00:03:02.030 
mulch I've talked about that before but

00:03:02.030 --> 00:03:03.640 
mulch I've talked about that before but
that<00:03:02.210> is<00:03:02.270> going<00:03:02.480> to<00:03:02.570> stop<00:03:02.840> most<00:03:03.230> weeds<00:03:03.500> from

00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:03.650 
that is going to stop most weeds from

00:03:03.650 --> 00:03:06.100 
that is going to stop most weeds from
coming<00:03:03.980> up<00:03:04.100> let's<00:03:04.340> go<00:03:04.460> have<00:03:04.610> a<00:03:04.640> look<00:03:04.910> at<00:03:05.480> okay

00:03:06.100 --> 00:03:06.110 
coming up let's go have a look at okay

00:03:06.110 --> 00:03:07.930 
coming up let's go have a look at okay
let's<00:03:06.350> check<00:03:06.620> out<00:03:06.680> this<00:03:07.040> new<00:03:07.310> garden<00:03:07.730> that<00:03:07.820> I

00:03:07.930 --> 00:03:07.940 
let's check out this new garden that I

00:03:07.940 --> 00:03:09.790 
let's check out this new garden that I
put<00:03:08.150> in<00:03:08.270> last<00:03:08.480> fall<00:03:08.810> not<00:03:09.260> a<00:03:09.290> whole<00:03:09.560> lot<00:03:09.770> of

00:03:09.790 --> 00:03:09.800 
put in last fall not a whole lot of

00:03:09.800 --> 00:03:11.620 
put in last fall not a whole lot of
weeds<00:03:10.040> going<00:03:10.340> on<00:03:10.460> in<00:03:10.610> here<00:03:10.850> are<00:03:11.030> there<00:03:11.210> and

00:03:11.620 --> 00:03:11.630 
weeds going on in here are there and

00:03:11.630 --> 00:03:13.810 
weeds going on in here are there and
that's<00:03:11.900> because<00:03:12.080> a<00:03:12.110> mulch<00:03:12.410> does<00:03:13.040> so<00:03:13.340> much<00:03:13.580> to

00:03:13.810 --> 00:03:13.820 
that's because a mulch does so much to

00:03:13.820 --> 00:03:14.500 
that's because a mulch does so much to
stop<00:03:14.000> weeds

00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:14.510 
stop weeds

00:03:14.510 --> 00:03:17.110 
stop weeds
I<00:03:14.600> had<00:03:15.020> a<00:03:15.050> leaf<00:03:15.320> mulch<00:03:15.590> in<00:03:15.800> here<00:03:16.010> over<00:03:16.790> the<00:03:16.910> fall

00:03:17.110 --> 00:03:17.120 
I had a leaf mulch in here over the fall

00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:18.760 
I had a leaf mulch in here over the fall
and<00:03:17.450> just<00:03:17.480> actually<00:03:18.290> in<00:03:18.350> the<00:03:18.440> last<00:03:18.590> couple

00:03:18.760 --> 00:03:18.770 
and just actually in the last couple

00:03:18.770 --> 00:03:19.900 
and just actually in the last couple
days<00:03:18.950> I've<00:03:19.160> been<00:03:19.190> laying<00:03:19.460> down<00:03:19.640> a<00:03:19.670> little

00:03:19.900 --> 00:03:19.910 
days I've been laying down a little

00:03:19.910 --> 00:03:21.430 
days I've been laying down a little
straw<00:03:20.210> because<00:03:20.390> some<00:03:20.690> of<00:03:20.780> the<00:03:20.840> leaves<00:03:21.080> blew

00:03:21.430 --> 00:03:21.440 
straw because some of the leaves blew

00:03:21.440 --> 00:03:23.200 
straw because some of the leaves blew
over<00:03:21.590> to<00:03:21.770> that<00:03:21.890> side<00:03:22.130> of<00:03:22.280> the<00:03:22.340> garden<00:03:22.610> so<00:03:23.090> now

00:03:23.200 --> 00:03:23.210 
over to that side of the garden so now

00:03:23.210 --> 00:03:24.760 
over to that side of the garden so now
I'm<00:03:23.330> laying<00:03:23.540> down<00:03:23.660> straw<00:03:24.110> those<00:03:24.530> are<00:03:24.650> my<00:03:24.710> two

00:03:24.760 --> 00:03:24.770 
I'm laying down straw those are my two

00:03:24.770 --> 00:03:27.100 
I'm laying down straw those are my two
favorite<00:03:25.400> kinds<00:03:25.610> of<00:03:25.700> mulch<00:03:25.880> and<00:03:26.150> I<00:03:26.780> do<00:03:26.840> not

00:03:27.100 --> 00:03:27.110 
favorite kinds of mulch and I do not

00:03:27.110 --> 00:03:29.260 
favorite kinds of mulch and I do not
have<00:03:27.290> any<00:03:27.470> weed<00:03:27.680> problems<00:03:28.160> in<00:03:28.460> this<00:03:28.910> garden

00:03:29.260 --> 00:03:29.270 
have any weed problems in this garden

00:03:29.270 --> 00:03:31.150 
have any weed problems in this garden
the<00:03:29.420> next<00:03:29.720> step<00:03:29.900> is<00:03:30.080> to<00:03:30.200> plant<00:03:30.410> very<00:03:30.650> densely

00:03:31.150 --> 00:03:31.160 
the next step is to plant very densely

00:03:31.160 --> 00:03:33.340 
the next step is to plant very densely
plant<00:03:31.610> polycultures<00:03:32.540> which<00:03:32.720> are<00:03:32.840> groups<00:03:33.140> of

00:03:33.340 --> 00:03:33.350 
plant polycultures which are groups of

00:03:33.350 --> 00:03:35.140 
plant polycultures which are groups of
different<00:03:33.620> kinds<00:03:33.800> of<00:03:33.860> plants<00:03:34.160> that<00:03:34.220> all<00:03:34.430> work

00:03:35.140 --> 00:03:35.150 
different kinds of plants that all work

00:03:35.150 --> 00:03:37.150 
different kinds of plants that all work
together<00:03:35.360> to<00:03:35.600> help<00:03:35.810> each<00:03:36.020> other<00:03:36.140> out<00:03:36.440> and<00:03:36.680> to

00:03:37.150 --> 00:03:37.160 
together to help each other out and to

00:03:37.160 --> 00:03:39.070 
together to help each other out and to
shade<00:03:37.430> out<00:03:37.460> the<00:03:37.640> soil<00:03:38.000> now<00:03:38.540> I<00:03:38.570> don't<00:03:38.720> have<00:03:38.900> much

00:03:39.070 --> 00:03:39.080 
shade out the soil now I don't have much

00:03:39.080 --> 00:03:40.690 
shade out the soil now I don't have much
going<00:03:39.290> on<00:03:39.500> yet<00:03:39.740> this<00:03:39.860> year<00:03:40.070> here's<00:03:40.370> my<00:03:40.550> little

00:03:40.690 --> 00:03:40.700 
going on yet this year here's my little

00:03:40.700 --> 00:03:42.760 
going on yet this year here's my little
strawberry<00:03:40.940> patch<00:03:41.480> it<00:03:42.140> doesn't<00:03:42.470> have<00:03:42.560> much

00:03:42.760 --> 00:03:42.770 
strawberry patch it doesn't have much

00:03:42.770 --> 00:03:44.680 
strawberry patch it doesn't have much
weed<00:03:43.010> problems<00:03:43.400> because<00:03:43.670> I<00:03:43.790> it's<00:03:44.420> pretty

00:03:44.680 --> 00:03:44.690 
weed problems because I it's pretty

00:03:44.690 --> 00:03:46.540 
weed problems because I it's pretty
dense<00:03:44.930> on<00:03:45.200> its<00:03:45.380> own<00:03:45.530> when<00:03:45.770> it<00:03:45.800> gets<00:03:46.010> going<00:03:46.250> and

00:03:46.540 --> 00:03:46.550 
dense on its own when it gets going and

00:03:46.550 --> 00:03:48.940 
dense on its own when it gets going and
I<00:03:46.610> plant<00:03:46.880> other<00:03:47.030> things<00:03:47.360> in<00:03:47.630> there<00:03:47.930> and<00:03:48.170> I

00:03:48.940 --> 00:03:48.950 
I plant other things in there and I

00:03:48.950 --> 00:03:51.250 
I plant other things in there and I
smother<00:03:49.400> it<00:03:49.610> with<00:03:49.640> leaves<00:03:50.060> so<00:03:50.660> that's<00:03:50.870> not<00:03:51.200> a

00:03:51.250 --> 00:03:51.260 
smother it with leaves so that's not a

00:03:51.260 --> 00:03:52.540 
smother it with leaves so that's not a
great<00:03:51.470> example<00:03:51.560> this<00:03:51.920> time<00:03:52.160> of<00:03:52.280> year<00:03:52.460> and

00:03:52.540 --> 00:03:52.550 
great example this time of year and

00:03:52.550 --> 00:03:53.950 
great example this time of year and
there's<00:03:52.760> the<00:03:52.940> last<00:03:53.150> step<00:03:53.450> right<00:03:53.600> there<00:03:53.810> if

00:03:53.950 --> 00:03:53.960 
there's the last step right there if

00:03:53.960 --> 00:03:55.720 
there's the last step right there if
you're<00:03:54.110> in<00:03:54.230> a<00:03:54.260> pinch<00:03:54.500> and<00:03:54.770> that's<00:03:54.890> vinegar

00:03:55.720 --> 00:03:55.730 
you're in a pinch and that's vinegar

00:03:55.730 --> 00:03:58.420 
you're in a pinch and that's vinegar
just<00:03:56.300> regular<00:03:56.690> household<00:03:57.140> vinegar<00:03:57.290> it's<00:03:58.100> 5

00:03:58.420 --> 00:03:58.430 
just regular household vinegar it's 5

00:03:58.430 --> 00:04:01.090 
just regular household vinegar it's 5
percent<00:03:58.640> acetic<00:03:59.270> acid<00:03:59.780> by<00:03:59.900> volume<00:04:00.350> it's<00:04:00.860> not

00:04:01.090 --> 00:04:01.100 
percent acetic acid by volume it's not

00:04:01.100 --> 00:04:02.980 
percent acetic acid by volume it's not
going<00:04:01.340> to<00:04:01.400> get<00:04:01.550> rid<00:04:01.790> of<00:04:01.820> some<00:04:02.390> of<00:04:02.510> those<00:04:02.570> you

00:04:02.980 --> 00:04:02.990 
going to get rid of some of those you

00:04:02.990 --> 00:04:04.360 
going to get rid of some of those you
know<00:04:03.020> dandelions<00:04:03.860> and<00:04:03.920> those<00:04:04.070> really<00:04:04.310> strong

00:04:04.360 --> 00:04:04.370 
know dandelions and those really strong

00:04:04.370 --> 00:04:06.490 
know dandelions and those really strong
perennials<00:04:05.030> that<00:04:05.210> will<00:04:05.570> do<00:04:05.930> a<00:04:05.960> really<00:04:06.350> good

00:04:06.490 --> 00:04:06.500 
perennials that will do a really good

00:04:06.500 --> 00:04:08.500 
perennials that will do a really good
job<00:04:06.650> on<00:04:06.890> annuals<00:04:07.520> and<00:04:07.730> it<00:04:08.030> will<00:04:08.180> weaken

00:04:08.500 --> 00:04:08.510 
job on annuals and it will weaken

00:04:08.510 --> 00:04:10.210 
job on annuals and it will weaken
perennials<00:04:08.990> too<00:04:09.140> just<00:04:09.380> like<00:04:09.470> a<00:04:09.500> hoe<00:04:09.710> does<00:04:09.920> over

00:04:10.210 --> 00:04:10.220 
perennials too just like a hoe does over

00:04:10.220 --> 00:04:12.070 
perennials too just like a hoe does over
time<00:04:10.400> so<00:04:10.970> what<00:04:11.180> you<00:04:11.270> do<00:04:11.390> here<00:04:11.630> is<00:04:11.720> you<00:04:11.810> put<00:04:11.990> this

00:04:12.070 --> 00:04:12.080 
time so what you do here is you put this

00:04:12.080 --> 00:04:13.960 
time so what you do here is you put this
in<00:04:12.200> a<00:04:12.290> spray<00:04:12.560> bottle<00:04:12.590> and<00:04:13.070> just<00:04:13.460> spray<00:04:13.760> it's

00:04:13.960 --> 00:04:13.970 
in a spray bottle and just spray it's

00:04:44.500 --> 00:04:44.510 
there all of that stuff is going to

00:04:44.510 --> 00:04:46.060 
there all of that stuff is going to
create<00:04:44.690> a<00:04:44.780> soil<00:04:45.050> that<00:04:45.140> doesn't<00:04:45.530> support<00:04:45.650> weeds

very well they just won't be able to
thrive<00:04:47.570> there<00:04:47.870> so<00:04:48.290> that's<00:04:48.500> the<00:04:48.650> main<00:04:48.890> one

00:04:49.150 --> 00:04:49.160 
thrive there so that's the main one

00:04:49.160 --> 00:04:51.280 
thrive there so that's the main one
along<00:04:49.520> with<00:04:49.820> smothering<00:04:50.780> them<00:04:50.960> out<00:04:51.110> with<00:04:51.260> a

because<00:05:01.790> in<00:05:01.910> the<00:05:02.000> garden<00:05:02.300> we<00:05:02.420> can<00:05:02.540> put<00:05:02.660> a<00:05:02.690> thick

00:05:02.890 --> 00:05:02.900 
because in the garden we can put a thick

because in the garden we can put a thick
mulch<00:05:03.080> on<00:05:03.290> and<00:05:03.470> that<00:05:03.560> can<00:05:03.710> cover<00:05:03.950> a<00:05:04.040> lot<00:05:04.280> so<00:05:04.550> the

00:05:04.660 --> 00:05:04.670 
mulch on and that can cover a lot so the

that's what we got to do that so the

00:05:07.760 --> 00:05:09.760 
that's what we got to do that so the
