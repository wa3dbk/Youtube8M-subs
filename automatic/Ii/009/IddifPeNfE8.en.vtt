help them in engineering and upgrading
their<00:00:26.039> product<00:00:26.580> a<00:00:26.970> plant<00:00:27.539> for<00:00:27.869> producing

00:00:28.370 --> 00:00:28.380 
their product a plant for producing

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:33.440 
their product a plant for producing
biomass<00:00:28.800> we<00:00:29.789> try<00:00:30.420> to<00:00:30.480> optimize<00:00:32.090> on<00:00:33.090> the

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:33.450 
biomass we try to optimize on the

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:35.180 
biomass we try to optimize on the
production<00:00:33.809> side<00:00:33.989> here<00:00:34.559> in<00:00:34.829> the<00:00:34.860> house

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:35.190 
production side here in the house

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:38.350 
production side here in the house
instead<00:00:35.610> of<00:00:35.899> doing<00:00:36.899> a<00:00:36.989> lot<00:00:37.170> of<00:00:37.350> hours<00:00:37.559> on-site

00:00:38.350 --> 00:00:38.360 
instead of doing a lot of hours on-site

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:41.540 
instead of doing a lot of hours on-site
basically<00:00:39.360> the<00:00:39.510> lock<00:00:39.719> bolts<00:00:40.020> brought<00:00:40.739> us<00:00:41.040> to

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:41.550 
basically the lock bolts brought us to

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:44.000 
basically the lock bolts brought us to
this<00:00:41.730> final<00:00:42.090> solution<00:00:42.780> it<00:00:42.930> really<00:00:43.350> means<00:00:43.860> that

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:44.010 
this final solution it really means that

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:45.740 
this final solution it really means that
we<00:00:44.190> were<00:00:44.399> able<00:00:44.550> to<00:00:44.760> produce<00:00:45.120> in<00:00:45.450> a<00:00:45.539> modular

00:00:45.740 --> 00:00:45.750 
we were able to produce in a modular

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:49.160 
we were able to produce in a modular
kind<00:00:46.289> of<00:00:46.469> manner<00:00:46.920> and<00:00:47.420> by<00:00:48.420> doing<00:00:48.690> so<00:00:48.989> we

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:49.170 
kind of manner and by doing so we

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:51.410 
kind of manner and by doing so we
brought<00:00:49.410> down<00:00:49.649> production<00:00:50.280> time<00:00:50.579> and<00:00:50.820> we

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:51.420 
brought down production time and we

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:54.920 
brought down production time and we
brought<00:00:51.660> up<00:00:52.110> the<00:00:52.649> quality<00:00:53.160> so<00:00:53.789> basically<00:00:54.420> lock

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:54.930 
brought up the quality so basically lock

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:57.680 
brought up the quality so basically lock
bolts<00:00:55.320> was<00:00:55.500> our<00:00:55.920> solution<00:00:56.280> on<00:00:56.699> this<00:00:56.850> whole

00:00:57.680 --> 00:00:57.690 
bolts was our solution on this whole

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:00.319 
bolts was our solution on this whole
task<00:00:58.020> if<00:00:58.800> you<00:00:59.039> look<00:00:59.280> at<00:00:59.460> the<00:00:59.609> production<00:00:59.969> time

00:01:00.319 --> 00:01:00.329 
task if you look at the production time

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:05.770 
task if you look at the production time
on-site<00:01:01.160> its<00:01:02.160> cop<00:01:02.520> down<00:01:02.789> by<00:01:03.090> nearly<00:01:03.769> 10<00:01:04.769> days

00:01:05.770 --> 00:01:05.780 
on-site its cop down by nearly 10 days

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:08.990 
on-site its cop down by nearly 10 days
by<00:01:06.780> four<00:01:07.080> guys<00:01:07.320> so<00:01:07.770> that's<00:01:08.100> quite<00:01:08.400> massively

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:09.000 
by four guys so that's quite massively

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:11.960 
by four guys so that's quite massively
if<00:01:09.479> everything<00:01:09.960> goes<00:01:10.110> well<00:01:10.170> these<00:01:10.830> bio<00:01:11.430> plants

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:11.970 
if everything goes well these bio plants

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:14.270 
if everything goes well these bio plants
they<00:01:12.479> don't<00:01:12.510> get<00:01:12.960> driven<00:01:13.350> down<00:01:13.530> they<00:01:13.860> really

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:14.280 
they don't get driven down they really

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:17.600 
they don't get driven down they really
run<00:01:14.490> through<00:01:14.930> in<00:01:15.930> the<00:01:16.140> region<00:01:16.470> of<00:01:16.590> 20<00:01:17.009> years<00:01:17.220> so

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:17.610 
run through in the region of 20 years so

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:20.240 
run through in the region of 20 years so
we<00:01:17.790> needed<00:01:18.030> a<00:01:18.240> system<00:01:18.420> which<00:01:18.810> is<00:01:19.020> a<00:01:19.070> secure<00:01:20.070> on

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:20.250 
we needed a system which is a secure on

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:22.820 
we needed a system which is a secure on
vibration<00:01:20.939> and<00:01:21.180> and<00:01:21.450> basically<00:01:22.259> doesn't<00:01:22.500> come

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:22.830 
vibration and and basically doesn't come

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:25.999 
vibration and and basically doesn't come
down<00:01:22.860> and<00:01:23.369> with<00:01:24.000> these<00:01:24.299> lock<00:01:25.049> bolts<00:01:25.350> which<00:01:25.770> are

00:01:25.999 --> 00:01:26.009 
down and with these lock bolts which are

00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:30.469 
down and with these lock bolts which are
tested<00:01:26.580> by<00:01:26.820> the<00:01:26.880> DI<00:01:27.450> VT<00:01:28.549> we<00:01:29.549> knew<00:01:29.850> that<00:01:30.150> you

00:01:30.469 --> 00:01:30.479 
tested by the DI VT we knew that you

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:32.450 
tested by the DI VT we knew that you
know<00:01:30.600> we<00:01:30.750> have<00:01:30.900> a<00:01:30.930> proper<00:01:31.500> solution<00:01:31.650> there<00:01:32.220> and

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:32.460 
know we have a proper solution there and

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:34.429 
know we have a proper solution there and
a<00:01:32.610> noncom<00:01:33.030> hardware<00:01:33.479> supply<00:01:33.869> that's<00:01:34.110> a<00:01:34.229> great

00:01:34.429 --> 00:01:34.439 
a noncom hardware supply that's a great

00:01:34.439 --> 00:01:36.649 
a noncom hardware supply that's a great
product<00:01:34.770> there<00:01:35.189> we<00:01:35.610> are<00:01:35.820> ended<00:01:36.150> up<00:01:36.299> with<00:01:36.630> a

00:01:36.649 --> 00:01:36.659 
product there we are ended up with a

00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:40.039 
product there we are ended up with a
solution<00:01:37.350> which<00:01:37.820> works<00:01:38.820> perfectly<00:01:39.119> now<00:01:39.689> so

00:01:40.039 --> 00:01:40.049 
solution which works perfectly now so

00:01:40.049 --> 00:02:16.370 
solution which works perfectly now so
it's<00:01:40.350> been<00:01:40.590> a<00:01:40.650> real<00:01:41.310> success<00:01:41.820> story<00:01:41.850> I<00:01:42.240> think

00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:16.380 

00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:18.440
