00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:05.280 
paying attention to his body he's he's

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:06.770 
paying attention to his body he's he's
not<00:02:05.310> willing<00:02:05.790> to<00:02:05.939> do<00:02:06.180> something<00:02:06.600> to

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:06.780 
not willing to do something to

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:10.699 
not willing to do something to
permanently<00:02:07.409> hurt<00:02:07.619> himself<00:02:08.599> but<00:02:09.599> I<00:02:10.170> should

00:02:10.699 --> 00:02:10.709 
permanently hurt himself but I should

00:02:10.709 --> 00:02:12.660 
permanently hurt himself but I should
probably<00:02:10.739> turn<00:02:11.039> off<00:02:11.190> this<00:02:11.370> timer<00:02:11.670> bed

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:12.670 
probably turn off this timer bed

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:14.940 
probably turn off this timer bed
I<00:02:12.959> think<00:02:13.959> it<00:02:14.020> adds<00:02:14.170> a<00:02:14.290> nice<00:02:14.410> touch<00:02:14.620> to<00:02:14.860> the

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:14.950 
I think it adds a nice touch to the

00:02:14.950 --> 00:02:20.100 
I think it adds a nice touch to the
video<00:02:16.200> John<00:02:17.200> is<00:02:17.819> John<00:02:18.819> is<00:02:19.030> consulting<00:02:19.989> with

00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:20.110 
video John is John is consulting with

00:02:20.110 --> 00:02:22.949 
video John is John is consulting with
professionals<00:02:20.739> on<00:02:20.890> his<00:02:21.160> on<00:02:21.459> his<00:02:21.520> health<00:02:21.959> and

00:02:22.949 --> 00:02:22.959 
professionals on his on his health and

00:02:22.959 --> 00:02:26.160 
professionals on his on his health and
although<00:02:23.560> he's<00:02:23.830> got<00:02:24.010> pains<00:02:24.430> he's<00:02:25.030> just<00:02:25.330> simply

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:26.170 
although he's got pains he's just simply

00:02:26.170 --> 00:02:27.570 
although he's got pains he's just simply
putting<00:02:26.380> one<00:02:26.620> foot<00:02:26.650> in<00:02:26.890> front<00:02:27.010> of<00:02:27.220> the<00:02:27.280> next

00:02:27.570 --> 00:02:27.580

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:29.800 
and he's running through it so I think

00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:32.309
