00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:37.910 
in that game and played it quite a bit

00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:41.660 
in that game and played it quite a bit
and<00:02:39.230> ever<00:02:40.230> since<00:02:40.530> then<00:02:40.800> the<00:02:41.100> Call<00:02:41.250> of<00:02:41.280> Duty's

00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:41.670

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:44.060 
and ever since then the Call of Duty's
for<00:02:41.880> me<00:02:42.060> have<00:02:42.420> been<00:02:42.450> really<00:02:42.900> poor<00:02:43.650> quality

00:02:44.060 --> 00:02:44.070 
for me have been really poor quality

00:02:44.070 --> 00:02:46.370 
for me have been really poor quality
games<00:02:44.400> I<00:02:44.610> haven't<00:02:44.970> enjoyed<00:02:45.060> them<00:02:45.420> I<00:02:45.540> think

00:02:46.370 --> 00:02:46.380 
games I haven't enjoyed them I think

00:02:46.380 --> 00:02:49.960 
games I haven't enjoyed them I think
they've<00:02:46.680> been<00:02:46.850> real<00:02:47.850> copy-paste<00:02:48.600> bad<00:02:49.260> um

00:02:49.960 --> 00:02:49.970 
they've been real copy-paste bad um

00:02:49.970 --> 00:02:53.150 
they've been real copy-paste bad um
innovative<00:02:50.970> pieces<00:02:51.840> of<00:02:52.140> art<00:02:52.320> they've<00:02:53.010> been

00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:53.160 
innovative pieces of art they've been

00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:55.880 
innovative pieces of art they've been
really<00:02:53.430> terrible<00:02:53.930> now<00:02:54.930> by<00:02:55.110> no<00:02:55.380> means<00:02:55.620> am<00:02:55.800> i

00:02:55.880 --> 00:02:55.890 
really terrible now by no means am i

00:02:55.890 --> 00:02:57.500 
really terrible now by no means am i
saying<00:02:56.280> that<00:02:56.460> this<00:02:56.580> is<00:02:56.790> a<00:02:56.820> piece<00:02:57.060> of<00:02:57.180> art<00:02:57.390> or

00:02:57.500 --> 00:02:57.510 
saying that this is a piece of art or

00:02:57.510 --> 00:02:59.740 
saying that this is a piece of art or
anything<00:02:57.810> like<00:02:58.050> that<00:02:58.110> I<00:02:58.380> still<00:02:58.650> think<00:02:58.950> is<00:02:59.280> a

00:02:59.740 --> 00:02:59.750 
anything like that I still think is a

00:02:59.750 --> 00:03:02.660 
anything like that I still think is a
Call<00:03:00.750> of<00:03:00.780> Duty<00:03:01.200> and<00:03:01.410> a<00:03:01.860> lot<00:03:02.070> of<00:03:02.100> it<00:03:02.250> probably<00:03:02.430> is

00:03:02.660 --> 00:03:02.670 
Call of Duty and a lot of it probably is

00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:05.270 
Call of Duty and a lot of it probably is
copied<00:03:02.970> and<00:03:03.090> pasted<00:03:03.560> but<00:03:04.560> I<00:03:04.590> think<00:03:04.890> it's<00:03:05.010> a<00:03:05.100> lot

00:03:05.270 --> 00:03:05.280 
copied and pasted but I think it's a lot

00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:07.850 
copied and pasted but I think it's a lot
more<00:03:05.580> like<00:03:06.480> I<00:03:06.600> think<00:03:06.780> it's<00:03:06.900> ok<00:03:07.320> because<00:03:07.590> the

00:03:07.850 --> 00:03:07.860 
more like I think it's ok because the

00:03:07.860 --> 00:03:09.230 
more like I think it's ok because the
things<00:03:08.100> that's<00:03:08.310> kept<00:03:08.580> in<00:03:08.760> around<00:03:09.030> Call<00:03:09.210> of

00:03:09.230 --> 00:03:09.240 
things that's kept in around Call of

00:03:09.240 --> 00:03:11.240 
things that's kept in around Call of
Duty<00:03:09.630> are<00:03:09.810> the<00:03:09.930> things<00:03:10.140> that<00:03:10.230> make<00:03:10.980> Call<00:03:11.220> of

00:03:11.240 --> 00:03:11.250 
Duty are the things that make Call of

00:03:11.250 --> 00:03:13.130 
Duty are the things that make Call of
Duty<00:03:11.700> call<00:03:12.210> of<00:03:12.360> Jesus<00:03:12.480> like<00:03:12.780> they<00:03:12.900> haven't

00:03:13.130 --> 00:03:13.140 
Duty call of Jesus like they haven't

00:03:13.140 --> 00:03:14.690 
Duty call of Jesus like they haven't
changed<00:03:13.470> call<00:03:13.800> of<00:03:13.890> duty<00:03:14.100> to<00:03:14.220> the<00:03:14.280> point<00:03:14.490> where

00:03:14.690 --> 00:03:14.700 
changed call of duty to the point where

00:03:14.700 --> 00:03:18.170 
changed call of duty to the point where
it's<00:03:15.680> not<00:03:16.680> call<00:03:16.920> of<00:03:17.040> duty<00:03:17.340> anymore<00:03:17.670> and<00:03:17.880> it's

00:03:18.170 --> 00:03:18.180 
it's not call of duty anymore and it's

00:03:18.180 --> 00:03:19.760 
it's not call of duty anymore and it's
something<00:03:18.570> completely<00:03:18.780> different<00:03:19.080> it<00:03:19.500> still

00:03:19.760 --> 00:03:19.770 
something completely different it still

00:03:19.770 --> 00:03:21.260 
something completely different it still
feels<00:03:20.070> like<00:03:20.190> a<00:03:20.310> Call<00:03:20.550> of<00:03:20.580> Duty<00:03:20.940> which<00:03:21.090> is<00:03:21.239> a

00:03:21.260 --> 00:03:21.270 
feels like a Call of Duty which is a

00:04:46.160 --> 00:04:46.170 
that's kind of been my only complaint

00:04:46.170 --> 00:04:48.200 
that's kind of been my only complaint
apart<00:04:46.620> from<00:04:46.860> the<00:04:47.160> spawn<00:04:47.400> points<00:04:47.790> are<00:04:47.880> a<00:04:47.970> little

00:04:48.200 --> 00:04:48.210 
apart from the spawn points are a little

00:04:48.210 --> 00:04:50.090 
apart from the spawn points are a little
bit<00:04:48.420> off<00:04:48.450> at<00:04:48.780> the<00:04:48.930> moment<00:04:49.080> but<00:04:49.500> the<00:04:49.800> spawn

00:04:50.090 --> 00:04:50.100 
bit off at the moment but the spawn

00:04:50.100 --> 00:04:51.620 
bit off at the moment but the spawn
points<00:04:50.550> is<00:04:50.700> something<00:04:51.030> that<00:04:51.120> I<00:04:51.150> don't<00:04:51.390> really

00:04:51.620 --> 00:04:51.630 
points is something that I don't really

00:04:51.630 --> 00:04:53.840 
points is something that I don't really
want<00:04:51.900> to<00:04:51.990> complain<00:04:52.230> about<00:04:52.550> because<00:04:53.550> usually

00:04:53.840 --> 00:04:53.850 
want to complain about because usually

00:04:53.850 --> 00:04:58.700 
want to complain about because usually
with<00:04:54.420> patches<00:04:54.900> they<00:04:55.080> do<00:04:55.140> get<00:04:55.530> fixed<00:04:55.950> so<00:04:57.680> yeah<00:04:58.680> I

00:04:58.700 --> 00:04:58.710 
with patches they do get fixed so yeah I

00:04:58.710 --> 00:05:00.530 
with patches they do get fixed so yeah I
mean<00:04:58.980> that's<00:04:59.220> kind<00:04:59.700> of<00:04:59.760> my<00:04:59.880> only<00:05:00.060> complaint<00:05:00.300> is

00:05:00.530 --> 00:05:00.540 
mean that's kind of my only complaint is

00:05:00.540 --> 00:05:01.850 
mean that's kind of my only complaint is
the<00:05:00.690> cool<00:05:00.840> streaks<00:05:01.140> are<00:05:01.260> a<00:05:01.290> little<00:05:01.500> bit<00:05:01.620> boring

00:05:01.850 --> 00:05:01.860 
the cool streaks are a little bit boring

00:05:01.860 --> 00:05:05.060 
the cool streaks are a little bit boring
but<00:05:02.520> the<00:05:02.670> gameplay<00:05:02.970> for<00:05:03.900> me<00:05:04.050> is<00:05:04.440> definitely

00:05:05.060 --> 00:05:05.070 
but the gameplay for me is definitely

00:05:05.070 --> 00:05:08.060 
but the gameplay for me is definitely
one<00:05:05.250> of<00:05:05.280> the<00:05:05.430> best<00:05:06.470> recently<00:05:07.470> like<00:05:07.740> I<00:05:07.950> don't

00:05:08.060 --> 00:05:08.070 
one of the best recently like I don't

00:05:08.070 --> 00:05:09.710 
one of the best recently like I don't
know<00:05:08.430> if<00:05:08.550> it's<00:05:08.700> the<00:05:08.820> best<00:05:08.940> Call<00:05:09.180> of<00:05:09.210> Duty<00:05:09.600> is

00:05:09.710 --> 00:05:09.720 
know if it's the best Call of Duty is

00:05:09.720 --> 00:05:11.510

00:05:26.400 --> 00:05:29.300 
has a honeymoon period for sure
and<00:05:26.490> then<00:05:26.790> things<00:05:27.240> start<00:05:27.600> to<00:05:27.960> get<00:05:28.140> used<00:05:28.500> overly

00:05:29.300 --> 00:05:29.310 
and then things start to get used overly

00:05:29.310 --> 00:05:32.150 
and then things start to get used overly
too<00:05:29.460> much<00:05:29.670> it<00:05:29.910> makes<00:05:30.030> a<00:05:30.150> bat<00:05:30.330> game<00:05:30.570> bad<00:05:30.980> but<00:05:31.980> for

00:05:32.150 --> 00:05:32.160 
too much it makes a bat game bad but for

00:05:32.160 --> 00:05:34.910 
too much it makes a bat game bad but for
what<00:05:32.310> I've<00:05:32.460> played<00:05:32.850> so<00:05:33.180> far<00:05:33.540> I<00:05:33.840> really<00:05:34.800> like

00:05:34.910 --> 00:05:34.920 
what I've played so far I really like

00:05:34.920 --> 00:05:36.800 
what I've played so far I really like
this<00:05:35.160> game<00:05:35.340> I<00:05:35.580> think<00:05:35.670> it's<00:05:36.030> a<00:05:36.150> solid<00:05:36.330> Call<00:05:36.780> of

00:05:36.800 --> 00:05:36.810 
this game I think it's a solid Call of

00:05:36.810 --> 00:05:39.080 
this game I think it's a solid Call of
Duty<00:05:37.290> and<00:05:37.440> if<00:05:37.530> you<00:05:37.650> like<00:05:37.860> Call<00:05:38.160> of<00:05:38.190> Duty<00:05:38.640> or<00:05:38.820> did

00:05:39.080 --> 00:05:39.090 
Duty and if you like Call of Duty or did

00:05:39.090 --> 00:05:41.630 
Duty and if you like Call of Duty or did
at<00:05:39.240> any<00:05:39.390> point<00:05:39.690> in<00:05:39.870> your<00:05:40.050> gaming<00:05:40.740> career<00:05:41.370> if

00:05:41.630 --> 00:05:41.640 
at any point in your gaming career if

00:05:41.640 --> 00:05:44.630 
at any point in your gaming career if
you<00:05:42.000> like<00:05:42.680> then<00:05:43.680> I<00:05:43.710> would<00:05:44.040> recommend<00:05:44.190> picking

00:05:44.630 --> 00:05:44.640 
you like then I would recommend picking

00:05:44.640 --> 00:05:46.040 
you like then I would recommend picking
it<00:05:44.790> up<00:05:44.850> because<00:05:45.180> it<00:05:45.300> is<00:05:45.420> actually<00:05:45.840> quite<00:05:45.960> a

00:05:46.040 --> 00:05:46.050 
it up because it is actually quite a

00:05:46.050 --> 00:05:48.170 
it up because it is actually quite a
solid<00:05:46.290> Call<00:05:46.620> of<00:05:46.650> Duty<00:05:47.040> if<00:05:47.610> you<00:05:47.760> don't<00:05:47.970> enjoy

00:05:48.170 --> 00:05:48.180 
solid Call of Duty if you don't enjoy

00:05:48.180 --> 00:05:51.560 
solid Call of Duty if you don't enjoy
Call<00:05:49.050> of<00:05:49.080> Duty<00:05:49.410> games<00:05:49.620> then<00:05:50.400> I<00:05:50.640> probably<00:05:51.120> don't

00:05:51.560 --> 00:05:51.570 
Call of Duty games then I probably don't

00:05:51.570 --> 00:05:53.780 
Call of Duty games then I probably don't
recommend<00:05:52.110> it<00:05:52.260> because<00:05:52.500> you<00:05:53.190> know<00:05:53.310> if<00:05:53.580> you

00:05:53.780 --> 00:05:53.790 
recommend it because you know if you

00:05:53.790 --> 00:05:55.370 
recommend it because you know if you
don't<00:05:53.910> like<00:05:54.120> call<00:05:54.330> if<00:05:54.450> you<00:05:54.570> -<00:05:54.690> this<00:05:54.840> isn't<00:05:55.050> a

00:05:55.370 --> 00:05:55.380 
don't like call if you - this isn't a

00:05:55.380 --> 00:05:57.800 
don't like call if you - this isn't a
different<00:05:55.890> game<00:05:56.160> it<00:05:56.430> is<00:05:56.640> still<00:05:56.910> call<00:05:57.330> of<00:05:57.510> duty

00:05:57.800 --> 00:05:57.810 
different game it is still call of duty

00:05:57.810 --> 00:06:00.140 
different game it is still call of duty
so<00:05:58.020> you<00:05:58.920> know<00:05:59.100> if<00:05:59.340> you've<00:05:59.490> made<00:05:59.670> your<00:05:59.850> mind<00:05:59.970> up
