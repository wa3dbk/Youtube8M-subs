00:00:29.839 --> 00:00:29.849 
puts it in space and then also kind of

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:31.640 
puts it in space and then also kind of
adds<00:00:30.029> like<00:00:30.269> a<00:00:30.330> little<00:00:30.570> bit<00:00:30.660> of<00:00:30.750> a<00:00:30.810> MOBA<00:00:31.230> element

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:31.650 
adds like a little bit of a MOBA element

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:33.260 
adds like a little bit of a MOBA element
to<00:00:31.769> it<00:00:31.920> with<00:00:32.070> the<00:00:32.160> map<00:00:32.399> design<00:00:32.610> and<00:00:33.000> also<00:00:33.180> how

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:33.270 
to it with the map design and also how

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:35.930 
to it with the map design and also how
the<00:00:33.329> game<00:00:33.600> flow<00:00:33.899> is<00:00:34.230> ok<00:00:35.040> so<00:00:35.100> the<00:00:35.309> map<00:00:35.520> that's

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:35.940 
the game flow is ok so the map that's

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:36.860 
the game flow is ok so the map that's
pretty<00:00:36.149> interesting<00:00:36.300> we<00:00:36.540> need<00:00:36.660> to<00:00:36.719> talk<00:00:36.809> about

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:36.870 
pretty interesting we need to talk about

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:38.510 
pretty interesting we need to talk about
this<00:00:37.050> other<00:00:37.380> than<00:00:37.440> being<00:00:37.680> in<00:00:37.800> freaking<00:00:38.190> space

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:38.520 
this other than being in freaking space

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:40.520 
this other than being in freaking space
and<00:00:38.820> you<00:00:38.940> can<00:00:39.090> actually<00:00:39.239> float<00:00:39.660> in<00:00:39.870> 3d<00:00:40.320> space

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:40.530 
and you can actually float in 3d space

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:42.440 
and you can actually float in 3d space
go<00:00:40.860> up<00:00:41.040> and<00:00:41.160> down<00:00:41.309> or<00:00:41.579> hide<00:00:41.730> behind<00:00:41.879> asteroids

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:42.450 
go up and down or hide behind asteroids

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:44.510 
go up and down or hide behind asteroids
and<00:00:42.570> craziness<00:00:43.260> other<00:00:43.950> than<00:00:44.160> that<00:00:44.309> it's

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:44.520 
and craziness other than that it's

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:46.069 
and craziness other than that it's
actually<00:00:44.640> separated<00:00:45.239> in<00:00:45.329> quadrants<00:00:45.899> and<00:00:45.960> you

00:00:46.069 --> 00:00:46.079 
actually separated in quadrants and you

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:47.600 
actually separated in quadrants and you
can<00:00:46.170> actually<00:00:46.410> work<00:00:46.710> between<00:00:47.010> these<00:00:47.309> so<00:00:47.460> ya

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:47.610 
can actually work between these so ya

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:48.950 
can actually work between these so ya
like<00:00:47.820> it<00:00:47.850> like<00:00:47.969> League<00:00:48.300> of<00:00:48.329> Legends<00:00:48.719> you<00:00:48.809> can

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:48.960 
like it like League of Legends you can

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:50.540 
like it like League of Legends you can
press<00:00:49.140> B<00:00:49.379> to<00:00:49.410> back<00:00:49.770> or<00:00:50.010> in<00:00:50.100> DotA<00:00:50.309> you<00:00:50.430> can

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:50.550 
press B to back or in DotA you can

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:52.459 
press B to back or in DotA you can
teleports<00:00:51.000> back<00:00:51.239> to<00:00:51.360> your<00:00:51.480> base<00:00:51.629> in<00:00:51.870> this<00:00:52.260> game

00:00:52.459 --> 00:00:52.469 
teleports back to your base in this game

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:54.650 
teleports back to your base in this game
you<00:00:52.710> literally<00:00:53.010> go<00:00:53.399> freaking<00:00:53.789> warp<00:00:54.270> speed

00:00:54.650 --> 00:00:54.660 
you literally go freaking warp speed

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:56.900 
you literally go freaking warp speed
into<00:00:55.289> these<00:00:55.379> different<00:00:55.530> quadrants<00:00:55.890> so<00:00:56.820> you

00:00:56.900 --> 00:00:56.910 
into these different quadrants so you

00:00:56.910 --> 00:00:58.400 
into these different quadrants so you
have<00:00:57.030> your<00:00:57.059> base<00:00:57.329> quadrants<00:00:57.870> which<00:00:58.079> is<00:00:58.230> where

00:00:58.400 --> 00:00:58.410 
have your base quadrants which is where

00:00:58.410 --> 00:00:59.959 
have your base quadrants which is where
your<00:00:58.739> team<00:00:58.980> and<00:00:59.219> the<00:00:59.280> enemy<00:00:59.520> team<00:00:59.640> you<00:00:59.789> also

00:00:59.959 --> 00:00:59.969 
your team and the enemy team you also

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:01.310 
your team and the enemy team you also
have<00:01:00.090> a<00:01:00.149> middle<00:01:00.390> quadrant<00:01:00.899> which<00:01:00.989> doesn't

00:01:01.310 --> 00:01:01.320 
have a middle quadrant which doesn't

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:02.959 
have a middle quadrant which doesn't
even<00:01:01.440> open<00:01:01.649> until<00:01:01.859> a<00:01:02.070> certain<00:01:02.250> amount<00:01:02.699> of<00:01:02.789> time

00:01:02.959 --> 00:01:02.969 
even open until a certain amount of time

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:04.250 
even open until a certain amount of time
is<00:01:03.120> past<00:01:03.329> in<00:01:03.449> the<00:01:03.480> game<00:01:03.570> I<00:01:03.719> believe<00:01:03.809> and<00:01:04.140> then

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:04.260 
is past in the game I believe and then

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:05.660 
is past in the game I believe and then
also<00:01:04.409> you<00:01:04.530> have<00:01:04.650> these<00:01:04.769> side<00:01:05.010> quadrants<00:01:05.580> you

00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:05.670 
also you have these side quadrants you

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:07.010 
also you have these side quadrants you
have<00:01:05.790> like<00:01:05.939> a<00:01:06.030> and<00:01:06.270> B<00:01:06.479> and<00:01:06.510> this<00:01:06.780> is<00:01:06.840> where

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:07.020 
have like a and B and this is where

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:08.300 
have like a and B and this is where
you're<00:01:07.110> gonna<00:01:07.170> gather<00:01:07.409> resources<00:01:07.680> this<00:01:08.189> is

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:08.310 
you're gonna gather resources this is

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:09.950 
you're gonna gather resources this is
mainly<00:01:08.610> where<00:01:08.909> the<00:01:09.060> big<00:01:09.360> fighting<00:01:09.780> happens

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:09.960 
mainly where the big fighting happens

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:12.620 
mainly where the big fighting happens
why<00:01:10.799> do<00:01:10.860> you<00:01:11.040> want<00:01:11.220> resources<00:01:11.909> sky<00:01:12.180> okay<00:01:12.450> well

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:12.630 
why do you want resources sky okay well

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:14.330 
why do you want resources sky okay well
I'm<00:01:12.840> gonna<00:01:13.080> tell<00:01:13.229> you<00:01:13.320> you<00:01:13.680> want<00:01:13.860> resources

able to snipe across the map and what's

00:02:14.740 --> 00:02:15.990 
able to snipe across the map and what's
really<00:02:14.860> cool<00:02:14.980> is<00:02:15.160> that<00:02:15.340> not<00:02:15.610> only<00:02:15.700> do<00:02:15.880> you<00:02:15.910> have

00:02:15.990 --> 00:02:16.000 
really cool is that not only do you have

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:17.100 
really cool is that not only do you have
these<00:02:16.090> different<00:02:16.360> archetypes<00:02:16.780> with<00:02:17.020> these

00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:17.110 
these different archetypes with these

00:02:17.110 --> 00:02:18.180 
these different archetypes with these
different<00:02:17.380> ships<00:02:17.590> have<00:02:17.770> different<00:02:18.040> abilities

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:18.190 
different ships have different abilities

00:02:18.190 --> 00:02:19.950 
different ships have different abilities
but<00:02:18.670> you<00:02:18.850> can<00:02:18.970> actually<00:02:19.240> go<00:02:19.390> in<00:02:19.570> and<00:02:19.720> customize

00:02:19.950 --> 00:02:19.960 
but you can actually go in and customize

00:02:19.960 --> 00:02:21.390 
but you can actually go in and customize
these<00:02:20.350> pretty<00:02:20.650> well<00:02:20.890> you<00:02:21.010> can<00:02:21.100> change<00:02:21.310> around

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:21.400 
these pretty well you can change around

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:22.650 
these pretty well you can change around
the<00:02:21.580> different<00:02:21.850> abilities<00:02:22.240> and<00:02:22.360> what<00:02:22.480> a

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:22.660 
the different abilities and what a

00:02:22.660 --> 00:02:24.030 
the different abilities and what a
different<00:02:23.050> kind<00:02:23.260> of<00:02:23.320> weapons<00:02:23.650> you<00:02:23.740> have<00:02:23.800> with

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:24.040 
different kind of weapons you have with

00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:25.680 
different kind of weapons you have with
them<00:02:24.190> so<00:02:24.460> a<00:02:24.490> lot<00:02:24.850> of<00:02:24.880> customization<00:02:25.210> there<00:02:25.570> and

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:25.690 
them so a lot of customization there and

00:02:25.690 --> 00:02:26.700 
them so a lot of customization there and
I<00:02:25.720> think<00:02:25.870> that's<00:02:25.990> what<00:02:26.110> people<00:02:26.140> really<00:02:26.620> want

00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:26.710 
I think that's what people really want

00:02:26.710 --> 00:02:28.590 
I think that's what people really want
on<00:02:26.980> to<00:02:27.100> these<00:02:27.190> really<00:02:27.730> strategic<00:02:28.180> games<00:02:28.390> with

00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:28.600 
on to these really strategic games with

00:02:28.600 --> 00:02:30.000 
on to these really strategic games with
these<00:02:28.660> different<00:02:28.990> vehicles<00:02:29.350> it's<00:02:29.770> not<00:02:29.830> just

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:30.010 
these different vehicles it's not just

00:02:30.010 --> 00:02:31.020 
these different vehicles it's not just
about<00:02:30.100> collecting<00:02:30.490> all<00:02:30.580> the<00:02:30.670> different<00:02:30.910> kind

00:02:31.020 --> 00:02:31.030 
about collecting all the different kind

00:02:31.030 --> 00:02:31.980 
about collecting all the different kind
of<00:02:31.060> vehicles<00:02:31.390> as<00:02:31.480> else<00:02:31.600> about<00:02:31.780> the

00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:31.990 
of vehicles as else about the

00:02:31.990 --> 00:02:34.500 
of vehicles as else about the

saying there's not a good selection

00:02:39.670 --> 00:02:41.550 
saying there's not a good selection
because<00:02:40.180> you<00:02:40.720> know<00:02:40.810> for<00:02:40.990> the<00:02:41.020> amount<00:02:41.200> of<00:02:41.320> depth

00:02:41.550 --> 00:02:41.560 
because you know for the amount of depth

00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:42.750 
because you know for the amount of depth
and<00:02:41.650> the<00:02:41.770> amount<00:02:41.920> of<00:02:42.010> detail<00:02:42.340> not<00:02:42.550> just

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:42.760 
and the amount of detail not just

00:02:42.760 --> 00:02:44.610 
and the amount of detail not just
cosmetically<00:02:43.480> they're<00:02:43.900> also<00:02:44.020> mechanical<00:02:44.560> you

00:02:44.610 --> 00:02:44.620 
cosmetically they're also mechanical you

00:02:44.620 --> 00:02:45.840 
cosmetically they're also mechanical you
know<00:02:44.710> because<00:02:44.890> of<00:02:44.920> the<00:02:44.980> customization<00:02:45.550> I'm

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:45.850 
know because of the customization I'm

00:02:45.850 --> 00:02:47.610 
know because of the customization I'm
not<00:02:46.060> saying<00:02:46.270> that<00:02:46.330> there<00:02:46.540> is<00:02:46.660> not<00:02:46.900> a<00:02:46.930> lot<00:02:47.080> to<00:02:47.440> do

00:02:47.610 --> 00:02:47.620 
not saying that there is not a lot to do

00:02:47.620 --> 00:02:48.930 
not saying that there is not a lot to do
because<00:02:47.770> there<00:02:47.950> is<00:02:48.070> stuff<00:02:48.220> to<00:02:48.280> unlock<00:02:48.670> I'm

00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:48.940 
because there is stuff to unlock I'm

00:02:48.940 --> 00:02:50.100 
because there is stuff to unlock I'm
just<00:02:49.240> saying<00:02:49.420> that<00:02:49.600> you're<00:02:49.690> not<00:02:49.840> gonna<00:02:49.960> be

00:02:50.100 --> 00:02:50.110 
just saying that you're not gonna be

00:02:50.110 --> 00:02:51.750 
just saying that you're not gonna be
daunted<00:02:50.650> by<00:02:50.680> the<00:02:50.860> amount<00:02:51.160> of<00:02:51.190> selection<00:02:51.640> like

00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:51.760 
daunted by the amount of selection like

00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:53.730 
daunted by the amount of selection like
rule<00:02:52.000> of<00:02:52.150> tanks<00:02:52.450> as<00:02:52.570> right<00:02:52.810> now<00:02:52.990> remember<00:02:53.530> the

00:02:53.730 --> 00:02:53.740 
rule of tanks as right now remember the

00:02:53.740 --> 00:02:55.170 
rule of tanks as right now remember the
game<00:02:53.860> still<00:02:54.040> in<00:02:54.190> early<00:02:54.310> access<00:02:54.550> so<00:02:54.880> there<00:02:55.060> is<00:02:55.150> a

00:02:55.170 --> 00:02:55.180 
game still in early access so there is a

00:02:55.180 --> 00:02:57.150 
game still in early access so there is a
ton<00:02:55.690> of<00:02:55.720> potential<00:02:56.200> here<00:02:56.350> not<00:02:56.620> just<00:02:56.650> with<00:02:57.010> the

00:02:57.150 --> 00:02:57.160 
ton of potential here not just with the

00:02:57.160 --> 00:02:58.650 
ton of potential here not just with the
customization<00:02:57.790> are<00:02:57.910> the<00:02:58.000> different<00:02:58.300> types<00:02:58.510> of

00:02:58.650 --> 00:02:58.660 
customization are the different types of

00:02:58.660 --> 00:02:59.730 
customization are the different types of
weapons<00:02:59.080> that<00:02:59.170> they<00:02:59.290> can<00:02:59.410> add<00:02:59.530> to<00:02:59.650> these

00:02:59.730 --> 00:02:59.740 
weapons that they can add to these

00:02:59.740 --> 00:03:01.710 
weapons that they can add to these
vehicles<00:02:59.950> but<00:03:00.250> just<00:03:00.610> adding<00:03:00.940> entire<00:03:01.209> vehicles

00:03:01.710 --> 00:03:01.720 
vehicles but just adding entire vehicles

00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:03.030 
vehicles but just adding entire vehicles
say<00:03:02.170> it<00:03:02.290> to<00:03:02.380> me<00:03:02.500> that's<00:03:02.680> actually<00:03:02.920> pretty

00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:03.040 
say it to me that's actually pretty

00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:04.230 
say it to me that's actually pretty
exciting<00:03:03.490> it<00:03:03.580> shows<00:03:03.700> that<00:03:03.820> they're<00:03:03.970> trying<00:03:04.180> to

00:03:04.230 --> 00:03:04.240 
exciting it shows that they're trying to

00:03:04.240 --> 00:03:05.720 
exciting it shows that they're trying to
polish<00:03:04.690> each<00:03:05.020> and<00:03:05.170> every<00:03:05.350> vehicle

00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:05.730 
polish each and every vehicle

00:03:05.730 --> 00:03:07.560 
polish each and every vehicle
individually<00:03:06.730> and<00:03:06.880> also<00:03:07.120> trying<00:03:07.360> to<00:03:07.420> give

00:03:07.560 --> 00:03:07.570 
individually and also trying to give

00:03:07.570 --> 00:03:08.940 
individually and also trying to give
them<00:03:07.780> that<00:03:07.930> individual<00:03:08.530> shine<00:03:08.770> that

00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:08.950 
them that individual shine that

00:03:08.950 --> 00:03:10.680 
them that individual shine that
creativity<00:03:09.370> that<00:03:09.700> a<00:03:09.760> little<00:03:09.970> bit<00:03:10.060> of<00:03:10.180> unity

00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:10.690 
creativity that a little bit of unity

00:03:10.690 --> 00:03:12.449 
creativity that a little bit of unity
between<00:03:10.930> each<00:03:11.260> vehicle<00:03:11.709> unlike<00:03:12.100> World<00:03:12.340> of

00:03:12.449 --> 00:03:12.459 
between each vehicle unlike World of

00:03:12.459 --> 00:03:14.010 
between each vehicle unlike World of
Tanks<00:03:12.640> where<00:03:13.030> the<00:03:13.270> majority<00:03:13.390> of<00:03:13.690> Tanks

00:03:14.010 --> 00:03:14.020 
Tanks where the majority of Tanks

00:03:14.020 --> 00:03:15.960 
Tanks where the majority of Tanks
actually<00:03:14.320> handle<00:03:14.860> extremely<00:03:15.400> similarly<00:03:15.820> and

00:03:15.960 --> 00:03:15.970 
actually handle extremely similarly and

00:03:15.970 --> 00:03:17.850 
actually handle extremely similarly and
even<00:03:16.120> have<00:03:16.240> similar<00:03:16.690> statistics<00:03:17.260> by

00:03:17.850 --> 00:03:17.860 
even have similar statistics by

00:03:17.860 --> 00:03:19.199 
even have similar statistics by
comparing<00:03:18.310> it<00:03:18.400> to<00:03:18.430> the<00:03:18.519> world<00:03:18.730> the<00:03:18.790> tanks<00:03:19.120> are

00:03:19.199 --> 00:03:19.209 
comparing it to the world the tanks are

00:03:19.209 --> 00:03:20.460 
comparing it to the world the tanks are
probably<00:03:19.420> to<00:03:19.570> do<00:03:19.630> in<00:03:19.690> a<00:03:19.720> million<00:03:19.959> times<00:03:20.230> but

00:03:20.460 --> 00:03:20.470 
probably to do in a million times but

00:03:20.470 --> 00:03:21.720 
probably to do in a million times but
yeah<00:03:20.650> this<00:03:20.769> game<00:03:20.920> is<00:03:21.070> actually<00:03:21.160> like<00:03:21.430> World<00:03:21.640> of

00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:21.730 
yeah this game is actually like World of

00:03:21.730 --> 00:03:23.340 
yeah this game is actually like World of
Tanks<00:03:21.880> in<00:03:22.150> space<00:03:22.480> I<00:03:22.720> know<00:03:22.840> it<00:03:22.959> kind<00:03:23.140> of<00:03:23.170> takes

00:03:23.340 --> 00:03:23.350 
Tanks in space I know it kind of takes

00:03:23.350 --> 00:03:24.900 
Tanks in space I know it kind of takes
some<00:03:23.470> elements<00:03:23.769> from<00:03:23.830> MOBA<00:03:24.190> but<00:03:24.370> mechanically

00:03:24.900 --> 00:03:24.910 
some elements from MOBA but mechanically

00:03:24.910 --> 00:03:26.880 
some elements from MOBA but mechanically
I<00:03:25.269> mean<00:03:25.420> you<00:03:25.510> can't<00:03:25.660> deny<00:03:25.810> it's<00:03:26.110> very<00:03:26.590> very

00:03:26.880 --> 00:03:26.890 
I mean you can't deny it's very very

00:03:26.890 --> 00:03:28.470 
I mean you can't deny it's very very
similar<00:03:27.160> to<00:03:27.310> World<00:03:27.760> of<00:03:27.910> Tanks<00:03:28.000> it<00:03:28.239> uses<00:03:28.450> a

00:03:28.470 --> 00:03:28.480 
similar to World of Tanks it uses a

00:03:28.480 --> 00:03:29.880 
similar to World of Tanks it uses a
turret<00:03:28.810> aiming<00:03:29.110> system<00:03:29.260> which<00:03:29.530> you<00:03:29.620> don't

00:03:29.880 --> 00:03:29.890 
turret aiming system which you don't

00:03:29.890 --> 00:03:30.960 
turret aiming system which you don't
know<00:03:29.980> that<00:03:30.160> it's<00:03:30.310> like<00:03:30.459> a<00:03:30.550> third<00:03:30.730> person

00:03:30.960 --> 00:03:30.970 
know that it's like a third person

00:03:30.970 --> 00:03:33.060 
know that it's like a third person
shooter<00:03:31.269> accepted<00:03:31.780> a<00:03:31.840> true<00:03:32.170> reticle<00:03:32.709> of<00:03:32.920> where

00:03:33.060 --> 00:03:33.070 
shooter accepted a true reticle of where

00:03:33.070 --> 00:03:34.290 
shooter accepted a true reticle of where
your<00:03:33.220> shots<00:03:33.550> are<00:03:33.730> actually<00:03:33.970> going<00:03:34.060> to<00:03:34.150> aim

00:03:34.290 --> 00:03:34.300 
your shots are actually going to aim

00:03:34.300 --> 00:03:35.759 
your shots are actually going to aim
doesn't<00:03:34.570> follow<00:03:34.900> the<00:03:35.140> middle<00:03:35.380> of<00:03:35.470> your<00:03:35.620> screen

00:03:35.759 --> 00:03:35.769 
doesn't follow the middle of your screen

00:03:35.769 --> 00:03:37.770 
doesn't follow the middle of your screen
I'm<00:03:36.190> and<00:03:36.640> it<00:03:36.730> kind<00:03:36.940> of<00:03:36.970> follows<00:03:37.209> it<00:03:37.600> but

00:03:37.770 --> 00:03:37.780 
I'm and it kind of follows it but

00:03:37.780 --> 00:03:39.690 
I'm and it kind of follows it but
definitely<00:03:38.560> not<00:03:38.680> in<00:03:38.860> real<00:03:39.040> time<00:03:39.340> there's

00:03:39.690 --> 00:03:39.700 
definitely not in real time there's

00:03:39.700 --> 00:03:42.180 
definitely not in real time there's
actually<00:03:40.060> a<00:03:40.140> overlaid<00:03:41.140> reticle<00:03:41.830> and<00:03:42.100> then

00:03:42.180 --> 00:03:42.190 
actually a overlaid reticle and then

00:03:42.190 --> 00:03:44.520 
actually a overlaid reticle and then
this<00:03:42.310> is<00:03:42.430> the<00:03:42.550> true<00:03:42.880> aim<00:03:43.150> of<00:03:43.360> your<00:03:43.510> turrets<00:03:43.959> so

00:03:44.520 --> 00:03:44.530 
this is the true aim of your turrets so

00:03:44.530 --> 00:03:46.110 
this is the true aim of your turrets so
you<00:03:44.590> have<00:03:44.890> to<00:03:45.010> actually<00:03:45.250> look<00:03:45.670> at<00:03:45.820> your<00:03:45.940> target

00:03:46.110 --> 00:03:46.120 
you have to actually look at your target

00:03:46.120 --> 00:03:47.910 
you have to actually look at your target
and<00:03:46.360> then<00:03:46.540> wait<00:03:46.750> for<00:03:46.989> this<00:03:47.110> reticle<00:03:47.560> to<00:03:47.709> catch

00:03:47.910 --> 00:03:47.920 
and then wait for this reticle to catch

00:03:47.920 --> 00:03:49.380 
and then wait for this reticle to catch
up<00:03:48.130> with<00:03:48.310> you<00:03:48.519> and<00:03:48.670> if<00:03:48.730> you're<00:03:48.820> moving<00:03:49.239> it's

00:03:49.380 --> 00:03:49.390 
up with you and if you're moving it's

00:03:49.390 --> 00:03:50.520 
up with you and if you're moving it's
going<00:03:49.540> to<00:03:49.600> spread<00:03:49.930> out<00:03:50.140> it's<00:03:50.260> going<00:03:50.380> to<00:03:50.440> give

00:03:50.520 --> 00:03:50.530 
going to spread out it's going to give

00:03:50.530 --> 00:03:51.780 
going to spread out it's going to give
you<00:03:50.620> more<00:03:50.739> spread<00:03:51.070> if<00:03:51.250> you're<00:03:51.340> not<00:03:51.459> moving

00:03:51.780 --> 00:03:51.790 
you more spread if you're not moving

00:03:51.790 --> 00:03:52.890 
you more spread if you're not moving
it's<00:03:51.880> going<00:03:52.030> to<00:03:52.090> tighten<00:03:52.390> up<00:03:52.480> so<00:03:52.690> if<00:03:52.780> you're

00:05:06.219 --> 00:05:06.229 
I'm pretty excited yeah I think in my

00:05:06.229 --> 00:05:07.659 
I'm pretty excited yeah I think in my
total<00:05:06.620> play<00:05:06.770> time<00:05:06.800> I<00:05:06.979> got<00:05:07.130> actually<00:05:07.370> got<00:05:07.490> just

00:05:07.659 --> 00:05:07.669 
total play time I got actually got just

00:05:07.669 --> 00:05:10.300 
total play time I got actually got just
one<00:05:07.820> kill<00:05:08.090> and<00:05:08.660> so<00:05:08.930> I<00:05:08.960> got<00:05:09.380> killed<00:05:09.620> a<00:05:09.740> lot<00:05:09.889> but

00:05:10.300 --> 00:05:10.310 
one kill and so I got killed a lot but

00:05:10.310 --> 00:05:12.490 
one kill and so I got killed a lot but
in<00:05:10.610> all<00:05:10.729> those<00:05:10.910> awesome<00:05:11.180> fiery<00:05:11.570> explosions<00:05:12.349> in

00:05:12.490 --> 00:05:12.500 
in all those awesome fiery explosions in

00:05:12.500 --> 00:05:14.830 
in all those awesome fiery explosions in
space<00:05:12.530> i<00:05:13.070> think<00:05:13.370> in<00:05:13.759> between<00:05:14.150> getting<00:05:14.630> killed

00:05:14.830 --> 00:05:14.840 
space i think in between getting killed

00:05:14.840 --> 00:05:16.659 
space i think in between getting killed
and<00:05:14.990> killing<00:05:15.320> I<00:05:15.440> had<00:05:15.830> fun<00:05:16.070> somewhere<00:05:16.370> along

00:05:16.659 --> 00:05:16.669 
and killing I had fun somewhere along

00:05:16.669 --> 00:05:18.010 
and killing I had fun somewhere along
the<00:05:16.789> line<00:05:16.970> and<00:05:17.240> it<00:05:17.449> flipped<00:05:17.630> a<00:05:17.720> switch<00:05:17.810> in<00:05:17.990> my

00:05:18.010 --> 00:05:18.020 
the line and it flipped a switch in my

00:05:18.020 --> 00:05:19.839 
the line and it flipped a switch in my
brain<00:05:18.349> that<00:05:18.380> this<00:05:18.889> went<00:05:19.159> from<00:05:19.310> being<00:05:19.490> a<00:05:19.639> slow

00:05:19.839 --> 00:05:19.849 
brain that this went from being a slow

00:05:19.849 --> 00:05:21.969 
brain that this went from being a slow
paced<00:05:20.210> world<00:05:20.690> of<00:05:20.870> tanks<00:05:21.080> and<00:05:21.169> space<00:05:21.440> game<00:05:21.680> to

00:05:21.969 --> 00:05:21.979 
paced world of tanks and space game to

00:05:21.979 --> 00:05:23.260 
paced world of tanks and space game to
something<00:05:22.280> a<00:05:22.340> little<00:05:22.430> bit<00:05:22.610> more<00:05:22.759> unique<00:05:22.909> and

00:05:23.260 --> 00:05:23.270 
something a little bit more unique and

00:05:23.270 --> 00:05:24.550 
something a little bit more unique and
I'm<00:05:23.330> actually<00:05:23.479> liking<00:05:23.780> a<00:05:23.930> lot<00:05:23.960> of<00:05:24.199> the<00:05:24.289> smaller

00:05:24.550 --> 00:05:24.560 
I'm actually liking a lot of the smaller

00:05:24.560 --> 00:05:26.200 
I'm actually liking a lot of the smaller
features<00:05:24.830> that<00:05:25.159> I<00:05:25.220> can't<00:05:25.430> really<00:05:25.580> go<00:05:26.180> into

00:05:26.200 --> 00:05:26.210 
features that I can't really go into

00:05:26.210 --> 00:05:28.059 
features that I can't really go into
detail<00:05:26.419> here<00:05:26.720> but<00:05:26.960> i<00:05:27.139> think<00:05:27.530> the<00:05:27.620> game<00:05:27.740> overall

00:05:28.059 --> 00:05:28.069 
detail here but i think the game overall

00:05:28.069 --> 00:05:29.830 
detail here but i think the game overall
has<00:05:28.340> a<00:05:28.370> lot<00:05:28.669> of<00:05:28.699> potential<00:05:29.030> and<00:05:29.300> i<00:05:29.599> definitely

00:05:29.830 --> 00:05:29.840 
has a lot of potential and i definitely

00:05:29.840 --> 00:05:31.689 
has a lot of potential and i definitely
want<00:05:30.139> to<00:05:30.199> give<00:05:30.320> it<00:05:30.440> a<00:05:30.500> thumbs<00:05:30.740> up<00:05:30.919> absolutely

00:05:31.689 --> 00:05:31.699 
want to give it a thumbs up absolutely

00:05:31.699 --> 00:05:33.279 
want to give it a thumbs up absolutely
if<00:05:32.210> you<00:05:32.330> get<00:05:32.449> the<00:05:32.509> chance<00:05:32.539> to<00:05:32.780> play<00:05:32.810> fracture

00:05:33.279 --> 00:05:33.289 
if you get the chance to play fracture

00:05:33.289 --> 00:05:34.600 
if you get the chance to play fracture
space<00:05:33.500> go<00:05:33.650> ahead<00:05:33.830> and<00:05:33.979> try<00:05:34.159> it<00:05:34.190> and<00:05:34.400> get<00:05:34.520> your

00:05:34.600 --> 00:05:34.610 
space go ahead and try it and get your

00:05:34.610 --> 00:05:35.890 
space go ahead and try it and get your
friends<00:05:34.759> into<00:05:35.060> it<00:05:35.180> too<00:05:35.300> i<00:05:35.330> think<00:05:35.419> it<00:05:35.659> could

00:05:35.890 --> 00:05:35.900 
friends into it too i think it could

00:05:35.900 --> 00:05:37.689 
friends into it too i think it could
really<00:05:36.050> use<00:05:36.320> with<00:05:36.620> the<00:05:36.680> community<00:05:37.039> boost<00:05:37.250> if

00:05:37.689 --> 00:05:37.699 
really use with the community boost if

00:05:37.699 --> 00:05:39.189 
really use with the community boost if
it<00:05:38.060> seems<00:05:38.240> like<00:05:38.360> one<00:05:38.449> of<00:05:38.509> those<00:05:38.630> games<00:05:38.870> that's

00:05:39.189 --> 00:05:39.199 
it seems like one of those games that's

00:05:39.199 --> 00:05:40.540 
it seems like one of those games that's
gonna<00:05:39.320> probably<00:05:39.530> have<00:05:39.650> a<00:05:39.830> niche<00:05:40.009> following<00:05:40.460> i

00:05:40.540 --> 00:05:40.550 
gonna probably have a niche following i

00:05:40.550 --> 00:05:41.589 
gonna probably have a niche following i
don't<00:05:40.669> know<00:05:40.729> if<00:05:40.820> it's<00:05:40.909> gonna<00:05:41.000> be<00:05:41.120> competitive

00:05:41.589 --> 00:05:41.599 
don't know if it's gonna be competitive

00:05:41.599 --> 00:05:43.270 
don't know if it's gonna be competitive

00:05:43.270 --> 00:05:43.280 
at all like World of Tanks is but it's

00:05:43.280 --> 00:05:44.770
