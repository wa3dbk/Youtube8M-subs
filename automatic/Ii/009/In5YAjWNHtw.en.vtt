00:00:11.809 --> 00:00:17.490
 Hi everyone, you are very welcome. 

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:19.439
 to my office san andrÃ©s izarra ebx 

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:21.660
 the endocrinologist and look that I 

00:00:19.439 --> 00:00:24.509
 I prepared a coffee table for you 

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:26.580
 talk about the importance of our 

00:00:24.509 --> 00:00:28.020
 breakfast when we want 

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:29.100
 and also when we do not 

00:00:28.020 --> 00:00:31.619
 want to lose weight 

00:00:29.100 --> 00:00:34.050
 clinical studies say that most 

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:35.820
 of people who are overweight or 

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:37.800
 with obesity are people who do not 

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:39.809
 they take breakfast early in the morning from 

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:41.969
 regularly and sometimes they never take 

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:44.070
 either because they are late or because 

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:46.620
 gets a little more sick in the early morning 

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:47.399
 But when we stay a long time in 

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:50.010
 fasting 

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:51.719
 the tendency of our organism is always 

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:52.469
 that people are all food that people 

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:54.149
 to feed 

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:56.730
 he suffocates in the form of fat 

00:00:54.149 --> 00:00:59.640
 so one of the ways we start 

00:00:56.730 --> 00:01:01.649
 changing our habits is doing a good job 

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:04.229
 breakfast before leaving home 

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:06.750
 of course that is not all that much 

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:10.200
 which I prepared but two slices of bread 

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:12.420
 whole- grain toast or cereals 

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:15.240
 integral are a good choice of 

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:16.799
 carbohydrate that will offer fiber and 

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:19.530
 will make you have this 

00:01:16.799 --> 00:01:20.400
 society throughout the day and the period 

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:22.650
 in the morning 

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:26.729
 in addition foods containing 

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:30.060
 calcium and white cheese 

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:32.040
 supply the calcium and phosphorus 

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:32.610
 proteins to get you started on your 

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:35.310
 day 

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:37.110
 here we also separated fruits that 

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:39.360
 people can also ingest the amount 

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:41.490
 will depend on the amount of calories 

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:44.729
 What are you going to be able to do throughout the day? 

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:47.220

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:51.750

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:56.340
