a look at the last one the candy fish
are<00:04:00.340> swimming

00:04:04.509 --> 00:04:04.519 

00:04:04.519 --> 00:04:07.070 

and<00:04:05.519> this<00:04:05.670> one's<00:04:05.849> actually<00:04:06.000> really<00:04:06.209> cool<00:04:06.750> this

00:04:07.070 --> 00:04:07.080 
and this one's actually really cool this

00:04:07.080 --> 00:04:10.089 
and this one's actually really cool this
is<00:04:07.430> this<00:04:08.430> is<00:04:08.610> where<00:04:08.760> you<00:04:08.879> have<00:04:09.030> to<00:04:09.239> draw<00:04:09.959> the

00:04:10.089 --> 00:04:10.099 
is this is where you have to draw the

00:04:10.099 --> 00:04:12.800 
is this is where you have to draw the
the<00:04:11.099> object<00:04:11.760> on<00:04:11.909> the<00:04:12.030> screen<00:04:12.150> so<00:04:12.480> they<00:04:12.569> asked

00:04:12.800 --> 00:04:12.810 
the object on the screen so they asked

00:04:12.810 --> 00:04:17.060 
the object on the screen so they asked
us<00:04:12.870> we<00:04:13.080> can<00:04:13.230> draw<00:04:13.379> a<00:04:13.409> straight<00:04:13.739> line<00:04:15.620> and<00:04:16.620> then

00:04:17.060 --> 00:04:17.070 
us we can draw a straight line and then

00:04:17.070 --> 00:04:18.319 
us we can draw a straight line and then
the<00:04:17.220> cool<00:04:17.400> thing<00:04:17.609> is<00:04:17.699> the<00:04:17.820> fish<00:04:18.000> will<00:04:18.180> swim

00:04:18.319 --> 00:04:18.329 
the cool thing is the fish will swim

00:04:18.329 --> 00:04:22.099 
the cool thing is the fish will swim
across<00:04:18.600> that<00:04:18.930> straight<00:04:19.229> line<00:04:20.750> which<00:04:21.750> is<00:04:21.900> nice

00:04:22.099 --> 00:04:22.109 
across that straight line which is nice

00:04:22.109 --> 00:04:28.550 
across that straight line which is nice
yeah<00:04:22.889> I'll<00:04:23.130> show<00:04:23.310> you<00:04:23.370> two<00:04:23.550> more<00:04:23.729> of<00:04:23.790> these<00:04:27.560> you

00:04:28.550 --> 00:04:28.560 
yeah I'll show you two more of these you

00:04:28.560 --> 00:04:32.860 
yeah I'll show you two more of these you
have<00:04:28.740> to<00:04:29.180> see<00:04:30.180> if<00:04:30.300> you<00:04:30.330> can<00:04:30.660> draw<00:04:30.870> this<00:04:31.199> circle

00:04:32.860 --> 00:04:32.870 
have to see if you can draw this circle

00:04:32.870 --> 00:04:35.450 
have to see if you can draw this circle
which<00:04:33.870> again<00:04:34.139> is<00:04:34.289> a<00:04:34.320> nice<00:04:34.560> fine<00:04:34.830> motor<00:04:35.100> skill

00:04:35.450 --> 00:04:35.460 
which again is a nice fine motor skill

00:04:35.460 --> 00:04:37.279 
which again is a nice fine motor skill
and<00:04:35.639> it's<00:04:35.760> really<00:04:36.000> cool<00:04:36.240> how<00:04:36.479> they<00:04:36.690> the<00:04:37.110> fish

00:04:37.279 --> 00:04:37.289 
and it's really cool how they the fish

00:04:37.289 --> 00:04:39.290 
and it's really cool how they the fish
jump<00:04:37.560> on<00:04:37.740> in<00:04:37.889> and<00:04:38.160> go<00:04:38.460> around<00:04:38.610> so<00:04:39.000> this<00:04:39.120> could

00:04:39.290 --> 00:04:39.300 
jump on in and go around so this could

00:04:39.300 --> 00:04:40.790 
jump on in and go around so this could
be<00:04:39.419> great<00:04:39.570> in<00:04:39.780> a<00:04:39.840> classroom<00:04:40.110> or<00:04:40.410> it<00:04:40.500> could<00:04:40.650> be

00:04:40.790 --> 00:04:40.800 
be great in a classroom or it could be
