00:00:18.769 --> 00:00:18.779 
talk a little bit about the psoas muscle

00:00:18.779 --> 00:00:21.500 
talk a little bit about the psoas muscle
and<00:00:19.020> the<00:00:19.680> psoas<00:00:20.010> muscle<00:00:20.400> is<00:00:20.640> the<00:00:20.670> only<00:00:21.150> muscle

00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:21.510 
and the psoas muscle is the only muscle

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:23.750 
and the psoas muscle is the only muscle
in<00:00:21.900> the<00:00:21.990> body<00:00:22.109> that<00:00:22.470> connects<00:00:22.769> the<00:00:23.039> torso<00:00:23.609> and

00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:23.760 
in the body that connects the torso and

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:27.080 
in the body that connects the torso and
the<00:00:23.850> limbs<00:00:24.060> and<00:00:24.810> this<00:00:25.350> muscle<00:00:25.859> connects<00:00:26.460> from

00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:27.090 
the limbs and this muscle connects from

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:29.450 
the limbs and this muscle connects from
the<00:00:27.269> inner<00:00:27.449> groin<00:00:27.720> and<00:00:28.170> it<00:00:28.680> wraps<00:00:28.920> over<00:00:29.369> the

00:00:29.450 --> 00:00:29.460 
the inner groin and it wraps over the

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:32.240 
the inner groin and it wraps over the
crest<00:00:29.760> of<00:00:29.970> the<00:00:30.090> ilium<00:00:30.480> and<00:00:30.890> attaches<00:00:31.890> to<00:00:31.920> the

00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:32.250 
crest of the ilium and attaches to the

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:34.580 
crest of the ilium and attaches to the
thoracic<00:00:32.460> 12<00:00:33.090> vertebrae<00:00:33.630> so<00:00:33.989> it<00:00:34.110> goes<00:00:34.290> all<00:00:34.559> the

00:00:34.580 --> 00:00:34.590 
thoracic 12 vertebrae so it goes all the

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:36.920 
thoracic 12 vertebrae so it goes all the
way<00:00:34.739> from<00:00:35.040> the<00:00:35.160> inside<00:00:35.579> of<00:00:35.610> the<00:00:35.820> groin<00:00:36.059> all<00:00:36.600> the

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:36.930 
way from the inside of the groin all the

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:39.080 
way from the inside of the groin all the
way<00:00:37.050> back<00:00:37.260> to<00:00:37.739> the<00:00:37.890> thoracic<00:00:38.070> 12<00:00:38.610> vertebrae

00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:39.090 
way back to the thoracic 12 vertebrae

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:42.500 
way back to the thoracic 12 vertebrae
and<00:00:39.390> so<00:00:40.140> this<00:00:40.469> muscle<00:00:41.040> is<00:00:41.309> really<00:00:41.940> important

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:42.510 
and so this muscle is really important

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:44.270 
and so this muscle is really important
in<00:00:42.600> the<00:00:42.690> body<00:00:42.899> and<00:00:43.230> it's<00:00:43.500> it's<00:00:43.829> really<00:00:44.160> a

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:44.280 
in the body and it's it's really a

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:47.869 
in the body and it's it's really a
common<00:00:44.789> one<00:00:44.969> that<00:00:45.000> tends<00:00:45.420> to<00:00:46.010> become<00:00:47.010> tight<00:00:47.610> or

00:00:47.869 --> 00:00:47.879 
common one that tends to become tight or

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:50.779 
common one that tends to become tight or
inflamed<00:00:48.360> and<00:00:48.780> and<00:00:49.200> trigger<00:00:49.469> kind<00:00:50.190> of<00:00:50.309> a

00:00:50.779 --> 00:00:50.789 
inflamed and and trigger kind of a

00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:52.700 
inflamed and and trigger kind of a
domino<00:00:51.329> effect<00:00:51.360> of<00:00:51.870> other<00:00:51.989> problems<00:00:52.469> in<00:00:52.680> the

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:52.710 
domino effect of other problems in the

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:54.670 
domino effect of other problems in the
body<00:00:52.800> one<00:00:53.250> of<00:00:53.370> which<00:00:53.489> can<00:00:53.670> be<00:00:53.730> low<00:00:54.000> back<00:00:54.239> pain

00:00:54.670 --> 00:00:54.680 
body one of which can be low back pain

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:58.220 
body one of which can be low back pain
the<00:00:55.680> other<00:00:55.829> can<00:00:56.160> be<00:00:56.550> something<00:00:57.120> you<00:00:57.989> know<00:00:58.109> as

00:00:58.220 --> 00:00:58.230 
the other can be something you know as

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:00.139 
the other can be something you know as
far<00:00:58.410> as<00:00:58.469> knee<00:00:58.859> problems<00:00:59.460> that<00:00:59.670> can<00:00:59.789> contribute

00:01:00.139 --> 00:01:00.149 
far as knee problems that can contribute

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:03.500 
far as knee problems that can contribute
to<00:01:00.410> neck<00:01:01.410> and<00:01:01.680> shoulder<00:01:02.100> problems<00:01:02.280> and<00:01:02.940> so

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:03.510 
to neck and shoulder problems and so

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:05.509 
to neck and shoulder problems and so
it's<00:01:03.660> basically<00:01:04.140> the<00:01:04.710> muscle<00:01:05.129> in<00:01:05.250> the<00:01:05.369> body

00:01:05.509 --> 00:01:05.519 
it's basically the muscle in the body

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:08.359 
it's basically the muscle in the body
that<00:01:05.970> governs<00:01:06.450> all<00:01:07.409> of<00:01:07.650> the<00:01:07.770> other<00:01:07.920> muscles

00:01:08.359 --> 00:01:08.369 
that governs all of the other muscles

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:11.810 
that governs all of the other muscles
and<00:01:08.640> so<00:01:09.330> if<00:01:10.080> it's<00:01:10.409> not<00:01:10.500> happy<00:01:11.100> everyone<00:01:11.640> else

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:11.820 
and so if it's not happy everyone else

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:14.990 
and so if it's not happy everyone else
is<00:01:12.080> agitated<00:01:13.080> as<00:01:13.200> a<00:01:13.229> result<00:01:13.650> of<00:01:13.830> that<00:01:13.950> so<00:01:14.670> um

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:15.000 
is agitated as a result of that so um

we're<00:01:23.520> going<00:01:23.640> to<00:01:23.700> talk<00:01:23.880> a<00:01:23.909> little<00:01:24.119> bit<00:01:24.240> about

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:24.360 
we're going to talk a little bit about

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:26.990 
we're going to talk a little bit about
parsvakonasana<00:01:25.320> and<00:01:26.130> I'm<00:01:26.280> going<00:01:26.460> to<00:01:26.549> break<00:01:26.850> it

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:27.000 
parsvakonasana and I'm going to break it

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:29.149 
parsvakonasana and I'm going to break it
down<00:01:27.030> for<00:01:27.180> the<00:01:27.540> alignment<00:01:27.840> and<00:01:28.229> so<00:01:28.710> again<00:01:28.920> this

00:01:29.149 --> 00:01:29.159 
down for the alignment and so again this

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:32.060 
down for the alignment and so again this
muscle<00:01:29.610> connects<00:01:30.329> to<00:01:30.600> connecting<00:01:31.320> the<00:01:31.500> torso

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:32.070 
muscle connects to connecting the torso

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:33.950 
muscle connects to connecting the torso
to<00:01:32.100> the<00:01:32.340> limbs<00:01:32.579> and<00:01:32.970> we're<00:01:33.329> gonna<00:01:33.420> do<00:01:33.659> a<00:01:33.689> pose

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:33.960 
to the limbs and we're gonna do a pose

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:36.230 
to the limbs and we're gonna do a pose
that's<00:01:34.229> going<00:01:34.380> to<00:01:34.439> be<00:01:34.530> really<00:01:34.829> helpful<00:01:35.759> to

00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:36.240 
that's going to be really helpful to

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:38.120 
that's going to be really helpful to
open<00:01:36.570> and<00:01:36.750> stretch<00:01:36.930> that<00:01:37.259> okay<00:01:37.680> part<00:01:38.009> is

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:38.130 
open and stretch that okay part is

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:40.550 
open and stretch that okay part is
spoken<00:01:38.549> asana<00:01:38.970> so<00:01:39.570> I'm<00:01:39.780> gonna<00:01:39.930> come<00:01:40.200> into

00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:40.560 
spoken asana so I'm gonna come into

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:44.749 
spoken asana so I'm gonna come into
downward<00:01:41.310> facing<00:01:41.340> dog<00:01:41.729> again<00:01:43.310> come<00:01:44.310> on<00:01:44.430> to<00:01:44.670> the
