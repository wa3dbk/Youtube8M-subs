00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:53.610 
for 35 minutes but the 20 lumens is 48

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:55.999 
for 35 minutes but the 20 lumens is 48
hours<00:01:54.000> and<00:01:54.299> the<00:01:54.630> half<00:01:54.869> a<00:01:55.020> luminous<00:01:55.380> for<00:01:55.590> 60

00:01:55.999 --> 00:01:56.009 
hours and the half a luminous for 60

00:01:56.009 --> 00:02:00.560 
hours and the half a luminous for 60
hours<00:01:56.780> the<00:01:57.780> light<00:01:57.960> is<00:01:58.290> waterproof<00:01:58.979> and<00:01:59.570> this

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:00.570 
hours the light is waterproof and this

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:02.300 
hours the light is waterproof and this
also<00:02:00.810> does<00:02:01.110> have<00:02:01.290> a<00:02:01.320> hidden<00:02:01.590> strobe<00:02:02.040> mode

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:02.310 
also does have a hidden strobe mode

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:04.480 
also does have a hidden strobe mode
which<00:02:03.240> is<00:02:03.390> probably<00:02:03.570> what<00:02:03.780> the<00:02:03.899> S<00:02:04.020> stands<00:02:04.350> for

00:02:04.480 --> 00:02:04.490 
which is probably what the S stands for

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:07.789 
which is probably what the S stands for
the<00:02:05.490> older<00:02:05.759> model<00:02:06.090> did<00:02:06.240> not<00:02:06.390> have<00:02:06.659> that<00:02:06.799> it

00:02:07.789 --> 00:02:07.799 
the older model did not have that it

00:02:07.799 --> 00:02:09.710 
the older model did not have that it
doesn't<00:02:08.250> get<00:02:08.340> in<00:02:08.489> the<00:02:08.520> way<00:02:08.610> so<00:02:08.819> for<00:02:09.599> you<00:02:09.690> guys

00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:11.970 
who don't like strobe you don't really

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:13.370

need to worry about it getting in the
way<00:02:13.470> because<00:02:14.070> it<00:02:14.220> does<00:02:14.370> not<00:02:17.330> it's<00:02:18.330> got<00:02:18.450> a

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:18.480 
way because it does not it's got a

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:23.920 
way because it does not it's got a

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:23.930 

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:27.860 

you're<00:02:24.930> gonna<00:02:25.050> sign<00:02:25.680> you<00:02:25.830> at<00:02:26.010> a<00:02:26.040> loop<00:02:26.310> oh<00:02:26.870> it's

00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:27.870 
you're gonna sign you at a loop oh it's

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:30.560 
you're gonna sign you at a loop oh it's
got<00:02:28.020> really<00:02:28.470> nice<00:02:28.650> squared<00:02:29.370> threads<00:02:29.790> they're

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:30.570 
got really nice squared threads they're

00:02:30.570 --> 00:02:33.880 
got really nice squared threads they're
really<00:02:30.720> smooth<00:02:31.170> and<00:02:32.120> nice<00:02:33.120> when<00:02:33.450> you're

00:02:33.880 --> 00:02:33.890 
really smooth and nice when you're

00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:36.890 
really smooth and nice when you're
tightening<00:02:34.890> it<00:02:35.190> down<00:02:35.510> all<00:02:36.510> right<00:02:36.630> the<00:02:36.750> first

twisty it'll come on your medium mode
which<00:02:43.860> is<00:02:43.890> supposed<00:02:44.400> to<00:02:44.490> be<00:02:44.610> 20<00:02:44.910> lumens<00:02:46.370> you

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:47.370 
which is supposed to be 20 lumens you

00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:48.650 
which is supposed to be 20 lumens you
loosen<00:02:47.760> it<00:02:47.850> tighten<00:02:48.150> it<00:02:48.210> then<00:02:48.330> it<00:02:48.420> comes<00:02:48.570> back

00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:48.660 
loosen it tighten it then it comes back

00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:51.260 
loosen it tighten it then it comes back
on<00:02:48.930> on<00:02:49.140> high<00:02:49.350> which<00:02:49.650> is<00:02:49.830> your<00:02:49.980> ad<00:02:50.130> lumen<00:02:50.580> you

00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:51.270 
on on high which is your ad lumen you

00:02:51.270 --> 00:02:53.540 
on on high which is your ad lumen you
can<00:02:51.420> see<00:02:51.660> in<00:02:51.990> my<00:02:52.050> opinion<00:02:52.740> it's<00:02:52.950> got<00:02:53.100> a<00:02:53.130> nearly

00:02:53.540 --> 00:02:53.550 
can see in my opinion it's got a nearly

00:02:53.550 --> 00:02:58.100 
can see in my opinion it's got a nearly
perfect<00:02:53.970> beam<00:02:54.770> it's<00:02:55.770> got<00:02:55.920> a<00:02:55.950> nice<00:02:56.960> kind<00:02:57.960> of

00:02:58.100 --> 00:02:58.110 
perfect beam it's got a nice kind of

00:02:58.110 --> 00:03:01.940 
perfect beam it's got a nice kind of
diffused<00:02:58.590> hotspot<00:02:59.160> and<00:03:00.080> pretty<00:03:01.080> lights<00:03:01.710> up<00:03:01.860> a

diffused hotspot and pretty lights up a

00:03:01.950 --> 00:03:05.030 
diffused hotspot and pretty lights up a
pretty<00:03:02.160> wide<00:03:02.400> area<00:03:03.530> you<00:03:04.530> loosen<00:03:04.860> and<00:03:04.980> tighten

00:03:05.030 --> 00:03:05.040 
pretty wide area you loosen and tighten

00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:06.530 
pretty wide area you loosen and tighten
it<00:03:05.220> one<00:03:05.340> more<00:03:05.460> time<00:03:05.610> you<00:03:05.820> get<00:03:05.940> that<00:03:06.060> moonlight

00:03:06.530 --> 00:03:06.540 
it one more time you get that moonlight

00:03:06.540 --> 00:03:10.820 
it one more time you get that moonlight
mode<00:03:06.840> which<00:03:07.530> is<00:03:07.770> a<00:03:07.800> half<00:03:08.310> a<00:03:08.460> lumen<00:03:09.650> so<00:03:10.650> it's

00:03:10.820 --> 00:03:10.830 
mode which is a half a lumen so it's

00:03:10.830 --> 00:03:15.040 
mode which is a half a lumen so it's
it's<00:03:11.430> like<00:03:11.520> nothing<00:03:12.800> twenty<00:03:13.800> women's<00:03:14.160> high

00:03:15.040 --> 00:03:15.050

00:03:15.050 --> 00:03:18.290 
it's like nothing twenty women's high
well<00:03:16.070> and<00:03:17.070> as<00:03:17.190> you<00:03:17.310> can<00:03:17.460> see<00:03:17.490> you<00:03:17.730> we<00:03:17.880> never<00:03:18.120> got

00:03:18.290 --> 00:03:18.300 
well and as you can see you we never got

00:03:18.300 --> 00:03:20.000 
well and as you can see you we never got
to<00:03:18.540> strobe<00:03:18.870> that's<00:03:19.200> because<00:03:19.590> if<00:03:19.770> you<00:03:19.860> actually

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:20.010 
to strobe that's because if you actually

00:03:20.010 --> 00:03:22.040 
to strobe that's because if you actually
want<00:03:20.400> the<00:03:20.580> strobe<00:03:20.880> you<00:03:21.570> have<00:03:21.690> to<00:03:21.810> cycle

00:03:22.040 --> 00:03:22.050 
want the strobe you have to cycle

00:03:22.050 --> 00:03:25.100 
want the strobe you have to cycle
through<00:03:22.230> it<00:03:22.560> twice<00:03:23.810> then<00:03:24.810> you<00:03:24.960> get<00:03:25.080> your

00:03:25.100 --> 00:03:25.110 
through it twice then you get your

00:03:25.110 --> 00:03:30.860 
through it twice then you get your
strobe<00:03:25.530> mode<00:03:28.880> and<00:03:29.880> quality<00:03:30.300> is<00:03:30.390> really<00:03:30.420> good

00:03:30.860 --> 00:03:30.870 
strobe mode and quality is really good

00:03:30.870 --> 00:03:34.460 
strobe mode and quality is really good
this<00:03:31.380> is<00:03:31.530> a<00:03:31.560> nice-sized<00:03:32.070> light<00:03:33.230> nice<00:03:34.230> and

small I'm here it is next to a Maglite
solitaire<00:03:39.930> you<00:03:40.350> can<00:03:40.470> see<00:03:40.650> it's<00:03:40.830> quite<00:03:41.160> a<00:03:41.250> bit

anyways<00:03:46.370> quality<00:03:47.370> is<00:03:47.490> excellent<00:03:47.700> though<00:03:48.240> the

00:03:48.980 --> 00:03:48.990 
anyways quality is excellent though the

00:03:48.990 --> 00:03:50.960 
anyways quality is excellent though the
price<00:03:49.200> of<00:03:49.410> these<00:03:49.530> lights<00:03:49.800> I<00:03:50.160> believe<00:03:50.760> our

00:03:50.960 --> 00:03:50.970 
price of these lights I believe our

00:03:50.970 --> 00:03:54.170 
price of these lights I believe our
around<00:03:51.209> 25<00:03:51.660> bucks<00:03:51.930> for<00:03:52.170> this<00:03:52.260> S<00:03:52.500> model<00:03:52.970> in<00:03:53.970> my
