00:02:32.259 --> 00:02:32.269 
Europe 6% Ireland and Scandinavia 1% of

00:02:32.269 --> 00:02:35.739 
Europe 6% Ireland and Scandinavia 1% of
that<00:02:32.889> so<00:02:33.889> between<00:02:34.340> both<00:02:34.579> companies<00:02:35.060> I<00:02:35.420> think

00:02:35.739 --> 00:02:35.749 
that so between both companies I think

00:02:35.749 --> 00:02:37.989 
that so between both companies I think
they<00:02:35.959> are<00:02:36.230> doing<00:02:36.439> an<00:02:36.650> excellent<00:02:37.099> job<00:02:37.370> as<00:02:37.790> far

00:02:37.989 --> 00:02:37.999 
they are doing an excellent job as far

00:02:37.999 --> 00:02:40.569 
they are doing an excellent job as far
as<00:02:38.120> the<00:02:38.239> science<00:02:38.480> behind<00:02:38.870> DNA<00:02:39.560> discovery<00:02:40.219> and

00:02:40.569 --> 00:02:40.579 
as the science behind DNA discovery and

00:02:40.579 --> 00:02:43.479 
as the science behind DNA discovery and
I<00:02:41.420> there<00:02:41.930> are<00:02:41.959> pros<00:02:42.260> and<00:02:42.439> cons<00:02:42.680> to<00:02:42.950> both<00:02:42.980> but<00:02:43.430> I

00:02:43.479 --> 00:02:43.489 
I there are pros and cons to both but I

00:02:43.489 --> 00:02:45.610 
I there are pros and cons to both but I
think<00:02:43.819> both<00:02:44.030> are<00:02:44.239> pros<00:02:44.540> because<00:02:44.870> science<00:02:45.500> is

00:02:45.610 --> 00:02:45.620 
think both are pros because science is

00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:48.399 
think both are pros because science is
changing<00:02:45.650> rapidly<00:02:46.400> and<00:02:46.969> as<00:02:47.420> it<00:02:47.629> changes<00:02:47.659> these

00:02:48.399 --> 00:02:48.409 
changing rapidly and as it changes these

00:02:48.409 --> 00:02:51.099 
changing rapidly and as it changes these
platforms<00:02:49.159> update<00:02:49.730> your<00:02:50.000> information<00:02:50.780> and

00:02:51.099 --> 00:02:51.109 
platforms update your information and

00:02:51.109 --> 00:02:53.199 
platforms update your information and
they<00:02:51.409> add<00:02:51.560> new<00:02:51.799> feature<00:02:52.099> so<00:02:52.250> you<00:02:52.579> can't<00:02:53.030> go

00:02:53.199 --> 00:02:53.209 
they add new feature so you can't go

00:02:53.209 --> 00:02:56.050 
they add new feature so you can't go
wrong<00:02:53.450> with<00:02:53.719> either<00:02:53.900> one<00:02:54.290> but<00:02:55.219> me<00:02:55.790> personally

00:02:56.050 --> 00:02:56.060 
wrong with either one but me personally

00:02:56.060 --> 00:03:01.270 
wrong with either one but me personally
I<00:02:56.450> wanted<00:02:56.900> to<00:02:57.109> use<00:02:57.969> ancestry.com<00:02:59.980> platform<00:03:00.980> to

00:03:01.270 --> 00:03:01.280 
I wanted to use ancestry.com platform to

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:04.390 
I wanted to use ancestry.com platform to
try<00:03:01.549> to<00:03:01.609> tie<00:03:01.909> some<00:03:02.329> of<00:03:02.359> my<00:03:02.599> DNA<00:03:02.870> matches<00:03:03.560> to<00:03:04.219> the

00:03:04.390 --> 00:03:04.400 
try to tie some of my DNA matches to the

00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:06.789 
try to tie some of my DNA matches to the
trees<00:03:04.969> that<00:03:05.209> I<00:03:05.239> have<00:03:05.510> set<00:03:05.810> up<00:03:05.840> on<00:03:06.139> there<00:03:06.530> so

00:03:06.789 --> 00:03:06.799 
trees that I have set up on there so

00:03:06.799 --> 00:03:08.500 
trees that I have set up on there so
it'll<00:03:06.980> make<00:03:07.250> it<00:03:07.400> slightly<00:03:07.730> easier

00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:08.510 
it'll make it slightly easier

00:03:08.510 --> 00:03:11.559 
it'll make it slightly easier
whereas<00:03:09.169> 23andme<00:03:10.030> doesn't<00:03:11.030> have<00:03:11.209> a<00:03:11.239> family

00:03:11.559 --> 00:03:11.569

tree<00:03:11.959> option<00:03:12.709> that's<00:03:13.040> really<00:03:14.469> really<00:03:15.469> I<00:03:15.859> don't

00:03:16.300 --> 00:03:16.310 
tree option that's really really I don't

00:03:16.310 --> 00:03:18.220 
tree option that's really really I don't
know<00:03:16.400> if<00:03:16.579> they<00:03:16.849> came<00:03:17.329> up<00:03:17.510> with<00:03:17.540> something<00:03:18.019> new

00:03:18.220 --> 00:03:18.230 
know if they came up with something new

00:03:18.230 --> 00:03:20.289 
know if they came up with something new
I<00:03:18.469> don't<00:03:18.859> know<00:03:18.919> how<00:03:19.069> popular<00:03:19.340> it<00:03:19.790> is<00:03:19.939> yet<00:03:20.269> but

00:03:20.289 --> 00:03:20.299 
I don't know how popular it is yet but

00:03:20.299 --> 00:03:22.390 
I don't know how popular it is yet but
it's<00:03:20.780> still<00:03:20.989> something<00:03:21.260> developing<00:03:22.129> so

00:03:24.550 --> 00:03:24.560 
really you be the judge you can either

00:03:24.560 --> 00:03:27.099 
really you be the judge you can either
buy<00:03:24.859> one<00:03:25.280> or<00:03:25.639> the<00:03:25.819> other<00:03:26.000> or<00:03:26.269> you<00:03:26.540> can<00:03:26.689> buy<00:03:26.840> both

00:03:27.099 --> 00:03:27.109 
buy one or the other or you can buy both

00:03:27.109 --> 00:03:29.619
