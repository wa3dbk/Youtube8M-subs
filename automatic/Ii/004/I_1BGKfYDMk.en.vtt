00:00:13.497 --> 00:00:18.502
 JACK THE RIPPER 

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:34.286
 Only one in fifty soldiers can kill without hesitation. 

00:00:35.093 --> 00:00:36.800
 I guess I'm that 2% right? 

00:00:39.093 --> 00:00:41.580
 Normal guys ... they could not stand it ... 

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:43.780
 All the blood and the dismembered parts ... 

00:00:44.033 --> 00:00:45.993
 Fear in the eyes that are lifeless. 

00:00:46.933 --> 00:00:47.826
 I do not... 

00:00:48.133 --> 00:00:49.006
 I like it. 

00:00:49.446 --> 00:00:50.306
 Much. 

00:00:53.313 --> 00:00:57.046
 The younger you learn to do something, the better you do it, understand? 

00:00:58.226 --> 00:01:00.700
 I remember Liberia as if it were yesterday ... 

00:01:01.266 --> 00:01:04.313
 All the abuse, the threats ... 

00:01:04.733 --> 00:01:08.406
 The next thing I remember, I get tired, I start cutting men into pieces. 

00:01:11.106 --> 00:01:12.926
 I'm going to enjoy this. 

00:01:15.125 --> 00:01:17.127
 DEVELOPED BY PLATINUMGAMES INC. 

00:01:34.973 --> 00:01:38.360
 Rayden, what's this mess ?! You can not give up! 

00:01:39.120 --> 00:01:40.486
 Sorry, Boris, it's done. 

00:01:40.993 --> 00:01:44.500
 It can not be that a member of Maverick is involved in an assault on the corporation, right? 

00:01:44.746 --> 00:01:46.640
 You can at least talk to me! 

00:01:47.033 --> 00:01:47.706
 Do not. 

00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:51.966
 It was time to break with the old Boris team, time to cut. 

00:01:52.393 --> 00:01:53.460
 Rayden! Ere ...! 

00:01:54.993 --> 00:01:55.880
 Wait 

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:11.886
 Fire! 

00:02:15.552 --> 00:02:17.554
 25th ANNIVERSARY OF METAL GEAR 

00:02:48.306 --> 00:02:51.593
 Military Cyborg, we do not have a license to act in this area! 

00:02:51.833 --> 00:02:54.086
 You are violating federal and state laws! 

00:02:57.533 --> 00:02:59.266
 I guess it's better that you arrest me then ... 

00:03:06.933 --> 00:03:11.733
 183104.7, threaten a policeman. Authoritative mortal force 

00:03:21.660 --> 00:03:23.473
 That's what I wanted to hear 

00:03:25.322 --> 00:03:27.157
 OBJECTIVE: ELIMINATES CYBORG AGENTS 

00:04:32.155 --> 00:04:35.959
 OBJECTIVE: GO TO THE HEADQUARTERS OF THE GREAT MARISCAL 

00:04:36.710 --> 00:04:39.960
 All that talk about justice, and here I am. 

00:04:40.780 --> 00:04:42.126
 Justice is not the murderer. 

00:04:44.367 --> 00:04:49.205
 OBJECTIVE: GO TO THE BALCONY 

00:06:23.233 --> 00:06:24.666
 Who is the next one? 

00:06:25.426 --> 00:06:29.573
 I have judged you wrong. You are like us after all! 

00:06:31.566 --> 00:06:33.313
 Now you're being disgusting 

00:06:37.920 --> 00:06:40.600
 That nickname that you like so much, 

00:06:41.826 --> 00:06:43.313
 Do you know how I got it? 

00:06:44.760 --> 00:06:48.186
 In fact, I'm going to show you 

00:06:50.486 --> 00:06:54.173
 I think it's time for Jack to start eviscerating! 

00:06:59.869 --> 00:07:03.606
 SHORT WHAT YOU WANT
