00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:06.980
 Hello everyone in this video I will tell you 

00:00:03.120 --> 00:00:15.020
 this is this wireless mouse brand 

00:00:06.980 --> 00:00:18.390
 deluxe lady waks here model m618 

00:00:15.020 --> 00:00:20.460
 that's why we need a vertical mouse than 

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:23.609
 they are different from the usual ones I have already told 

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:26.250
 and in the previous review another nouneym it 

00:00:23.609 --> 00:00:29.760
 such a vertical mouse and also in 

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:31.650
 unpacking to this one that's why on this one 

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:34.440
 I stop and I'm not going to detail and 

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:36.149
 if someone has not seen the previous pro 

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:37.680
 another vertical mouse I will leave 

00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:40.950
 The link in the description for this video may 

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:43.559
 look well and now tell about here 

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:45.930
 this same mouse mouse as you can see 

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:48.090
 wired here in this model by the way 

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:50.960
 which to them that for 17000 about 

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:53.940
 in different letters here are a few 

00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:56.399
 subspecies of this model is including 

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:58.460
 wireless still have some bread 

00:00:56.399 --> 00:01:03.239
 I do not know exactly how they differ 

00:00:58.460 --> 00:01:06.930
 but different models also exist 

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:10.409
 have seen such a silicone pad 

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:12.420
 case for such a mouse there are various 

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:14.430
 some kind of jumping on a massage 

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:16.850
 massage do not know but I imagine this is not 

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:20.189
 ordered so I can not say 

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:21.140
 interesting this thing or not in general itself 

00:01:20.189 --> 00:01:24.240
 mice 

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:26.810
 done pretty high quality right away 

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:30.090
 it is clear that the thing is not deshmanskaya 

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:32.180
 quite a branded build quality 

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:35.310
 I have no complaints 

00:01:32.180 --> 00:01:40.049
 Made from Astana Part of matte 

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:41.640
 high quality plastic here 

00:01:40.049 --> 00:01:43.280
 bottom slightly glossy such a bezel 

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:47.570
 the rest of the matt 

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:49.790
 so well below here we have an optical sensor 

00:01:47.570 --> 00:01:53.369
 standard left right button 

00:01:49.790 --> 00:01:55.970
 wheel mode shift button modes 

00:01:53.369 --> 00:01:55.970
 here 3 

00:01:56.240 --> 00:02:07.490
 if I'm not mistaken thousands now what 1600 

00:02:02.930 --> 00:02:08.539
 k600 on the site of the store in my opinion 

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:10.429
 the description was 

00:02:08.539 --> 00:02:13.430
 what is the maximum here now is two 

00:02:10.429 --> 00:02:14.900
 over thousands but it turned out to be wrong i 

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:18.290
 inclined to believe what is written on 

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:19.849
 box in general is not so important on 

00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:23.959
 dakini dance gaming mouse 

00:02:19.849 --> 00:02:28.010
 so some kind of too big 

00:02:23.959 --> 00:02:30.380
 now I think there is no need 

00:02:28.010 --> 00:02:34.819
 about the quality said there is a set 

00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:37.760
 such a covert type we either so here 

00:02:34.819 --> 00:02:39.890
 you can keep without her yes well then you're the one 

00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:51.950
 part of the hand rests on the table 

00:02:39.890 --> 00:02:54.290
 either if u hook somehow completely 

00:02:51.950 --> 00:03:00.859
 the whole brush falls on the surface of this 

00:02:54.290 --> 00:03:04.280
 she used the mouse for ten days too 

00:03:00.859 --> 00:03:07.609
 and could no longer why because I 

00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:10.010
 she seemed not very comfortable and I 

00:03:07.609 --> 00:03:12.470
 there was another vertical mouse and here 

00:03:10.010 --> 00:03:15.350
 there on my often subjective opinion 

00:03:12.470 --> 00:03:18.200
 there ergonomics were better who i used to 

00:03:15.350 --> 00:03:21.620
 literally a day can be 2 and already 

00:03:18.200 --> 00:03:26.380
 used it quite successfully until then 

00:03:21.620 --> 00:03:30.140
 until the wheel is broken there 

00:03:26.380 --> 00:03:32.750
 well I got used to a knin only two three days and 

00:03:30.140 --> 00:03:36.350
 anyway so until the end and not used to us 

00:03:32.750 --> 00:03:38.030
 does not seem to be very convenient way 

00:03:36.350 --> 00:03:39.769
 what about the wheel here everything is collected 

00:03:38.030 --> 00:03:42.920
 not great wheel here, too, some 

00:03:39.769 --> 00:03:46.519
 is dangling 

00:03:42.920 --> 00:03:48.950
 a little noise here if you shake like that 

00:03:46.519 --> 00:03:51.350
 let's say this and the expense of the wheel is not 

00:03:48.950 --> 00:03:55.209
 I know why it is here, too , somehow 

00:03:51.350 --> 00:03:59.319
 does nâ€™t look very reliable but hopefully 

00:03:55.209 --> 00:03:59.319
 nothing will happen to him 

00:03:59.650 --> 00:04:06.830
 so about ergonomics why she 

00:04:02.600 --> 00:04:08.060
 I'm not comfortable to do here goes 

00:04:06.830 --> 00:04:10.610
 wire yes here it is 

00:04:08.060 --> 00:04:13.250
 directions shows upwards that is 

00:04:10.610 --> 00:04:14.630
 if i want to hold the mouse cursor up 

00:04:13.250 --> 00:04:16.670
 on the connected is not necessary 

00:04:14.630 --> 00:04:19.700
 direction here do the wire goes 

00:04:16.670 --> 00:04:23.180
 so here it is to bring here 

00:04:19.700 --> 00:04:25.430
 and now let's see how it is 

00:04:23.180 --> 00:04:27.770
 Yes, I take my hand so that it is not convenient to 

00:04:25.430 --> 00:04:30.650
 fingers get straight on the buttons 

00:04:27.770 --> 00:04:32.570
 Here I get it so here 

00:04:30.650 --> 00:04:38.240
 this brush lies that is, it turns out that 

00:04:32.570 --> 00:04:40.520
 up somewhere up left goes away and so 

00:04:38.240 --> 00:04:43.100
 way if i want well here i have 

00:04:40.520 --> 00:04:47.030
 hand is comfortable lying up to hold 

00:04:43.100 --> 00:04:49.400
 to the left how logical it would be a mouse cursor 

00:04:47.030 --> 00:04:52.460
 will go neither left 

00:04:49.400 --> 00:04:54.530
 left up left down and certainly not 

00:04:52.460 --> 00:04:58.000
 I remember but the fact that it will be a little 

00:04:54.530 --> 00:05:01.430
 diagonally those because of this somehow 

00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:05.930
 quite difficult to get where you want 

00:05:01.430 --> 00:05:08.330
 because the accuracy was lost to 

00:05:05.930 --> 00:05:10.040
 up well as if from above it is not necessary 

00:05:08.330 --> 00:05:12.440
 have to take this brush 

00:05:10.040 --> 00:05:14.360
 and in that position if he k be 

00:05:12.440 --> 00:05:17.169
 lying is not very comfortable to use 

00:05:14.360 --> 00:05:20.270
 tired wrists here starts to hurt 

00:05:17.169 --> 00:05:23.660
 this is not good in theory vertical 

00:05:20.270 --> 00:05:27.820
 the mouse should prevention more wrist 

00:05:23.660 --> 00:05:31.160
 serve they on the contrary cause them therefore 

00:05:27.820 --> 00:05:34.370
 not very good yet as an option you can 

00:05:31.160 --> 00:05:36.980
 another grip let's say a little 

00:05:34.370 --> 00:05:40.150
 Further here so take a hand then 

00:05:36.980 --> 00:05:43.790
 true fingers get farther than 

00:05:40.150 --> 00:05:47.470
 Buttons enter but then all 

00:05:43.790 --> 00:05:51.650
 where it is necessary upwards from above turns out and here 

00:05:47.470 --> 00:05:54.260
 as if everything is right, they lie like this 

00:05:51.650 --> 00:05:56.600
 that you have to arch your arm like this 

00:05:54.260 --> 00:05:58.240
 also not clear where the finger is 

00:05:56.600 --> 00:06:00.849
 not clear where the buttons 

00:05:58.240 --> 00:06:02.789
 these two are not very convenient yet 

00:06:00.849 --> 00:06:06.550
 buttons are located forward back they 

00:06:02.789 --> 00:06:08.139
 very easy to press and cat if i 

00:06:06.550 --> 00:06:09.880
 I use let's say yes to me constantly 

00:06:08.139 --> 00:06:11.979
 I'll take the cat comfortably a little bit not there by 

00:06:09.880 --> 00:06:14.889
 diagonally trying to apply grip and 

00:06:11.979 --> 00:06:19.720
 inadvertently happens you press well, not really 

00:06:14.889 --> 00:06:23.500
 well, this is also my opinion 

00:06:19.720 --> 00:06:26.789
 I do not know who it may be there 

00:06:23.500 --> 00:06:30.220
 well this is my purely subjective opinion 

00:06:26.789 --> 00:06:33.159
 I read reviews of other people who 

00:06:30.220 --> 00:06:35.229
 bought similar devices to many 

00:06:33.159 --> 00:06:38.770
 like many used to me but here 

00:06:35.229 --> 00:06:41.880
 for some reason, somehow it's not liked 

00:06:38.770 --> 00:06:46.300
 in terms of convenience used 

00:06:41.880 --> 00:06:50.009
 so if you want yourself you can 

00:06:46.300 --> 00:06:53.680
 Of course buy in terms of quality 

00:06:50.009 --> 00:06:56.349
 no complaints but comfort 

00:06:53.680 --> 00:06:59.979
 which is known subjectively personally 

00:06:56.349 --> 00:07:04.570
 it seemed to me not enough 

00:06:59.979 --> 00:07:07.449
 use it as the main mouse on 

00:07:04.570 --> 00:07:10.000
 this is probably all thanks to all 

00:07:07.449 --> 00:07:13.479
 attention subscribe to my channel 

00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:16.259
 like the review if you like it but also 

00:07:13.479 --> 00:07:16.259
 to new meetings
