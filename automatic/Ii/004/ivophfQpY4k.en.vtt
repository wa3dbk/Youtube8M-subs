winged like look so I just want to try

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:32.450 
winged like look so I just want to try
it<00:00:28.800> because<00:00:28.919> um<00:00:29.930> usually<00:00:30.930> I<00:00:31.200> put<00:00:31.680> on<00:00:31.890> lots<00:00:32.160> of

00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:32.460 
it because um usually I put on lots of

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:35.660 
it because um usually I put on lots of
eye<00:00:32.669> makeup<00:00:32.969> and<00:00:33.450> I<00:00:34.219> think<00:00:35.219> this<00:00:35.309> looks<00:00:35.550> a

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:35.670 
eye makeup and I think this looks a

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:38.710 
eye makeup and I think this looks a
little<00:00:35.790> bit<00:00:35.970> more<00:00:36.090> natural<00:00:36.800> so<00:00:37.800> I<00:00:37.830> like<00:00:38.370> it

00:00:38.710 --> 00:00:38.720 
little bit more natural so I like it

00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:41.720 
little bit more natural so I like it
anyway<00:00:39.720> um<00:00:40.050> I<00:00:40.410> kind<00:00:40.830> of<00:00:40.950> wanted<00:00:41.190> to<00:00:41.340> do<00:00:41.520> my

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:41.730 
anyway um I kind of wanted to do my

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:44.270 
anyway um I kind of wanted to do my
first<00:00:41.760> I<00:00:42.360> makeup<00:00:42.930> tutorial<00:00:43.470> today<00:00:43.680> and<00:00:44.070> I'm<00:00:44.250> a

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:44.280 
first I makeup tutorial today and I'm a

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:45.380 
first I makeup tutorial today and I'm a
little<00:00:44.580> nervous<00:00:44.700> because<00:00:44.970> I've<00:00:45.150> never<00:00:45.180> done

00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:45.390 
little nervous because I've never done

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:49.490 
little nervous because I've never done
it<00:00:45.630> before<00:00:45.720> and<00:00:46.260> I<00:00:47.040> finally<00:00:47.340> bought<00:00:47.700> a<00:00:48.500> mirror

00:00:49.490 --> 00:00:49.500 
it before and I finally bought a mirror

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:53.930 
it before and I finally bought a mirror
so<00:00:50.370> I<00:00:50.760> can<00:00:50.790> um<00:00:51.660> actually<00:00:52.560> do<00:00:52.980> it<00:00:53.130> like<00:00:53.370> in<00:00:53.610> front

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:53.940 
so I can um actually do it like in front

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:56.420 
so I can um actually do it like in front
of<00:00:54.120> the<00:00:54.270> computer<00:00:54.450> while<00:00:55.070> showing<00:00:56.070> while

00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:51.760 
maybe with different skin tones it might

00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:53.610 
maybe with different skin tones it might
be<00:02:51.940> more<00:02:52.120> noticeable<00:02:52.360> that's<00:02:52.900> just<00:02:53.049> my<00:02:53.200> skin

00:02:53.610 --> 00:02:53.620 
be more noticeable that's just my skin

00:02:53.620 --> 00:02:58.589 
be more noticeable that's just my skin
tone<00:02:53.799> is<00:02:53.860> um<00:02:56.250> it's<00:02:57.250> kind<00:02:57.610> of<00:02:57.700> darker<00:02:58.299> than

00:02:58.589 --> 00:02:58.599 
tone is um it's kind of darker than

00:02:58.599 --> 00:03:01.710 
tone is um it's kind of darker than
usual<00:02:59.140> because<00:02:59.760> I've<00:03:00.760> been<00:03:00.819> tanning<00:03:01.360> and

00:03:01.710 --> 00:03:01.720

on the crease not too dark though

00:04:10.120 --> 00:04:21.800 
on the crease not too dark though
because<00:04:10.510> you<00:04:10.660> don't<00:04:10.840> want<00:04:10.870> it<00:04:11.080> looking<00:04:11.260> weird

and now as you can see i am done it's

00:05:08.319 --> 00:05:09.929 
and now as you can see i am done it's
not<00:05:08.529> like<00:05:08.770> like<00:05:08.949> I<00:05:09.099> said<00:05:09.370> it's<00:05:09.550> like<00:05:09.729> not

00:05:09.929 --> 00:05:09.939 
not like like I said it's like not

00:05:09.939 --> 00:05:12.480 
not like like I said it's like not
really<00:05:10.419> really<00:05:10.779> noticeable<00:05:11.259> it's<00:05:12.039> just<00:05:12.370> like

00:05:12.480 --> 00:05:12.490 
really really noticeable it's just like

00:05:12.490 --> 00:05:17.760 
really really noticeable it's just like
kind<00:05:13.300> of<00:05:13.419> a<00:05:13.539> natural<00:05:14.229> golden<00:05:15.159> smokey<00:05:15.999> look<00:05:16.809> and

00:05:17.760 --> 00:05:17.770 
kind of a natural golden smokey look and

00:05:17.770 --> 00:05:20.549 
kind of a natural golden smokey look and
I<00:05:18.219> think<00:05:18.460> it<00:05:18.550> also<00:05:18.610> looks<00:05:18.969> best<00:05:19.240> if<00:05:19.569> you<00:05:20.349> do

00:05:20.549 --> 00:05:20.559 
I think it also looks best if you do

00:05:20.559 --> 00:05:24.540 
I think it also looks best if you do
like<00:05:21.009> winged<00:05:21.819> eyeliner<00:05:22.749> like<00:05:23.409> that<00:05:23.589> because

00:05:24.540 --> 00:05:24.550 
like winged eyeliner like that because

00:05:24.550 --> 00:05:28.320 
like winged eyeliner like that because
then<00:05:24.909> you<00:05:25.120> have<00:05:25.150> kind<00:05:25.599> of<00:05:25.809> um<00:05:27.089> guidance<00:05:28.089> like

00:05:28.320 --> 00:05:28.330 
then you have kind of um guidance like

00:05:28.330 --> 00:05:31.019 
then you have kind of um guidance like
where<00:05:28.569> to<00:05:28.779> do<00:05:28.900> the<00:05:29.460> edges<00:05:30.460> of<00:05:30.490> the<00:05:30.639> darkness

00:05:31.019 --> 00:05:31.029 
where to do the edges of the darkness

00:05:31.029 --> 00:05:33.209 
where to do the edges of the darkness
and<00:05:31.449> it<00:05:31.599> like<00:05:31.930> I<00:05:32.169> think<00:05:32.499> it<00:05:32.589> looks<00:05:32.620> really<00:05:32.860> good

00:05:33.209 --> 00:05:33.219
