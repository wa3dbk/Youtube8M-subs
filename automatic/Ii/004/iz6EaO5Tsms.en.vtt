is jack from from minecraft and today
i'm<00:00:05.310> going<00:00:05.400> to<00:00:05.460> be<00:00:05.549> showing<00:00:05.790> you<00:00:06.029> the<00:00:06.210> most

00:00:06.380 --> 00:00:06.390 
i'm going to be showing you the most

00:00:06.390 --> 00:00:08.240 
i'm going to be showing you the most
effective<00:00:06.870> way<00:00:07.020> to<00:00:07.049> find<00:00:07.500> diamonds<00:00:07.770> in

00:00:08.240 --> 00:00:08.250 
effective way to find diamonds in

00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:10.759 
effective way to find diamonds in
Minecraft<00:00:08.820> so<00:00:09.420> first<00:00:09.870> you<00:00:10.110> have<00:00:10.200> to<00:00:10.349> get<00:00:10.469> to

00:00:10.759 --> 00:00:10.769 
Minecraft so first you have to get to

00:00:10.769 --> 00:00:13.610 
Minecraft so first you have to get to
the<00:00:11.070> bedrock<00:00:11.460> level<00:00:11.969> which<00:00:12.360> is<00:00:12.389> about<00:00:13.349> that

00:00:13.610 --> 00:00:13.620 
the bedrock level which is about that

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:18.650 
the bedrock level which is about that
far<00:00:13.950> from<00:00:14.250> the<00:00:14.490> surface<00:00:16.490> about<00:00:17.490> that<00:00:17.699> far<00:00:17.940> if

00:00:18.650 --> 00:00:18.660 
far from the surface about that far if

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:19.670 
far from the surface about that far if
you<00:00:18.779> want<00:00:18.960> you<00:00:19.020> interesting<00:00:19.320> a<00:00:19.380> straight<00:00:19.590> hoe

00:00:19.670 --> 00:00:19.680 
you want you interesting a straight hoe

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:21.529 
you want you interesting a straight hoe
like<00:00:19.830> I<00:00:19.980> did<00:00:20.189> just<00:00:20.220> for<00:00:20.520> time<00:00:20.670> purposes<00:00:20.880> and

00:00:21.529 --> 00:00:21.539 
like I did just for time purposes and

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:22.970 
like I did just for time purposes and
then<00:00:21.869> you<00:00:21.960> want<00:00:22.109> to<00:00:22.140> find<00:00:22.350> the<00:00:22.439> highest<00:00:22.650> block

00:00:22.970 --> 00:00:22.980 
then you want to find the highest block

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:25.279 
then you want to find the highest block
of<00:00:23.160> bedrock<00:00:23.430> which<00:00:23.490> is<00:00:23.789> right<00:00:23.939> here<00:00:23.970> and<00:00:24.359> this

00:00:25.279 --> 00:00:25.289 
of bedrock which is right here and this

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:26.990 
of bedrock which is right here and this
is<00:00:25.439> the<00:00:25.500> part<00:00:25.710> I'm<00:00:25.769> not<00:00:25.920> sure<00:00:26.189> about<00:00:26.310> I<00:00:26.609> usually

00:00:26.990 --> 00:00:27.000 
is the part I'm not sure about I usually

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:31.250 
is the part I'm not sure about I usually
go<00:00:27.390> about<00:00:27.599> one<00:00:28.369> to<00:00:29.369> three<00:00:29.789> blocks<00:00:30.720> above<00:00:30.929> it

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:31.260 
go about one to three blocks above it

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:33.500 
go about one to three blocks above it
there's<00:00:31.920> definitely<00:00:32.250> people<00:00:32.430> who<00:00:32.790> will<00:00:33.059> say

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:33.510 
there's definitely people who will say

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:35.360 
there's definitely people who will say
that's<00:00:33.690> not<00:00:33.989> the<00:00:34.380> correct<00:00:34.860> height<00:00:35.160> for

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:35.370 
that's not the correct height for

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:39.290 
that's not the correct height for
diamond<00:00:35.730> um<00:00:35.969> I<00:00:37.040> haven't<00:00:38.040> done<00:00:38.219> any<00:00:38.399> research

00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:39.300 
diamond um I haven't done any research

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:40.880 
diamond um I haven't done any research
so<00:00:39.690> I'm<00:00:39.750> not<00:00:39.840> sure<00:00:39.930> if<00:00:40.079> that<00:00:40.140> is<00:00:40.379> the<00:00:40.530> best<00:00:40.710> type

00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:40.890 
so I'm not sure if that is the best type

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:43.760 
so I'm not sure if that is the best type
but<00:00:41.460> I<00:00:41.489> mean<00:00:41.760> all<00:00:42.239> these<00:00:42.719> Heights<00:00:42.989> will<00:00:43.170> work<00:00:43.350> I

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:43.770 
but I mean all these Heights will work I

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:44.959 
but I mean all these Heights will work I
don't<00:00:44.100> even<00:00:44.160> know<00:00:44.340> if<00:00:44.399> there<00:00:44.550> is<00:00:44.670> really<00:00:44.940> a

00:00:44.959 --> 00:00:44.969 
don't even know if there is really a

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:46.610 
don't even know if there is really a
best<00:00:45.270> height<00:00:45.480> I<00:00:45.750> just<00:00:46.110> know<00:00:46.230> you<00:00:46.320> have<00:00:46.350> to<00:00:46.500> be

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:46.620 
best height I just know you have to be

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:48.799 
best height I just know you have to be
deep<00:00:46.829> and<00:00:47.070> I<00:00:47.219> usually<00:00:47.489> go<00:00:47.670> two<00:00:48.120> to<00:00:48.570> three

00:00:48.799 --> 00:00:48.809 
deep and I usually go two to three

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:51.170 
deep and I usually go two to three
blocks<00:00:49.079> above<00:00:49.350> the<00:00:49.680> bedrock<00:00:50.039> and<00:00:50.309> then<00:00:50.910> once

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:51.180 
blocks above the bedrock and then once

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:52.580 
blocks above the bedrock and then once
you<00:00:51.270> get<00:00:51.420> down<00:00:51.539> here<00:00:51.600> you<00:00:51.989> want<00:00:52.140> to<00:00:52.199> clear<00:00:52.440> out

00:00:52.580 --> 00:00:52.590 
you get down here you want to clear out

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:55.340 
you get down here you want to clear out
a<00:00:52.620> rim<00:00:52.920> which<00:00:53.789> I<00:00:54.059> love<00:00:54.510> that<00:00:54.719> notch<00:00:54.930> made<00:00:55.170> you

00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:55.350 
a rim which I love that notch made you

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:58.189 
a rim which I love that notch made you
mine<00:00:55.789> redstone<00:00:56.789> faster<00:00:57.510> I<00:00:57.539> think<00:00:57.840> he<00:00:57.930> did<00:00:58.050> that

00:00:58.189 --> 00:00:58.199 
mine redstone faster I think he did that

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:01.250 
mine redstone faster I think he did that
at<00:00:58.260> one<00:00:58.379> point<00:00:58.410> seven<00:00:59.030> and<00:01:00.079> what<00:01:01.079> we're<00:01:01.170> going

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:01.260 
at one point seven and what we're going

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:03.920 
at one point seven and what we're going
to<00:01:01.350> be<00:01:01.410> doing<00:01:01.590> is<00:01:01.920> branch<00:01:02.850> mining<00:01:03.270> which<00:01:03.660> is<00:01:03.899> a

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:03.930 
to be doing is branch mining which is a

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:05.390 
to be doing is branch mining which is a
lot<00:01:04.530> of<00:01:04.559> people<00:01:04.650> already<00:01:04.949> know<00:01:05.070> how<00:01:05.159> to<00:01:05.189> do

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:05.400 
lot of people already know how to do

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:07.730 
lot of people already know how to do
this<00:01:05.549> but<00:01:06.150> most<00:01:06.450> people<00:01:06.810> do<00:01:06.990> it<00:01:07.140> a<00:01:07.170> way<00:01:07.500> that's

00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:07.740 
this but most people do it a way that's

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:10.219 
this but most people do it a way that's
not<00:01:07.890> like<00:01:08.220> super<00:01:08.460> effective<00:01:08.880> most<00:01:09.659> people<00:01:10.020> do

00:01:10.219 --> 00:01:10.229 
not like super effective most people do

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:15.920 
not like super effective most people do
branch<00:01:10.560> mining<00:01:11.000> like<00:01:12.000> this<00:01:13.010> and<00:01:14.010> then<00:01:14.689> this<00:01:15.689> is

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:15.930 
branch mining like this and then this is

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:18.670 
branch mining like this and then this is
like<00:01:16.590> this<00:01:16.830> way<00:01:17.009> to<00:01:17.070> mine<00:01:17.369> just<00:01:17.880> having<00:01:18.150> two

00:01:18.670 --> 00:01:18.680 
like this way to mine just having two

00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:21.770 
like this way to mine just having two
tunnels<00:01:19.680> like<00:01:19.799> this<00:01:20.570> actually<00:01:21.570> you<00:01:21.659> know<00:01:21.720> what

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:21.780 
tunnels like this actually you know what

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:25.880 
tunnels like this actually you know what
I<00:01:21.900> just<00:01:22.049> wanted<00:01:22.229> like<00:01:22.320> this<00:01:22.500> up<00:01:24.320> so<00:01:25.320> just<00:01:25.740> for

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:25.890 
I just wanted like this up so just for

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:27.980 
I just wanted like this up so just for
light<00:01:26.130> purposes<00:01:26.580> only<00:01:26.850> frame<00:01:27.420> rate<00:01:27.600> i'll<00:01:27.810> turn

00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:27.990 
light purposes only frame rate i'll turn

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:31.490 
light purposes only frame rate i'll turn
my<00:01:28.049> thing<00:01:28.560> back<00:01:28.799> down<00:01:29.090> okay<00:01:30.090> most<00:01:31.020> people<00:01:31.259> mind

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:31.500 
my thing back down okay most people mind

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:34.310 
my thing back down okay most people mind
like<00:01:31.680> this<00:01:31.950> which<00:01:32.579> is<00:01:32.850> the<00:01:33.210> most<00:01:34.079> effective

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:34.320 
like this which is the most effective

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:37.640 
like this which is the most effective
way<00:01:34.740> until<00:01:35.280> I<00:01:35.670> thought<00:01:35.939> of<00:01:36.150> actually<00:01:36.840> my<00:01:37.409> part

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:37.650 
way until I thought of actually my part

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:39.410 
way until I thought of actually my part
on<00:01:37.710> my<00:01:37.829> channel<00:01:38.130> David<00:01:38.460> thought<00:01:38.610> of<00:01:38.700> this<00:01:38.820> but

00:01:39.410 --> 00:01:39.420 
on my channel David thought of this but

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:41.090 
on my channel David thought of this but
i'll<00:01:40.079> show<00:01:40.229> you<00:01:40.320> my<00:01:40.439> win<00:01:40.590> a<00:01:40.650> second<00:01:40.920> most

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:41.100 
i'll show you my win a second most

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:42.530 
i'll show you my win a second most
people<00:01:41.340> mind<00:01:41.520> like<00:01:41.670> this<00:01:41.700> which<00:01:42.150> remaining

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:42.540 
people mind like this which remaining

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:44.389 
people mind like this which remaining
four<00:01:42.750> blocks<00:01:43.049> and<00:01:43.320> you're<00:01:43.799> seeing<00:01:44.100> the

00:01:44.389 --> 00:01:44.399 
four blocks and you're seeing the

00:01:44.399 --> 00:01:47.300 
four blocks and you're seeing the
surfaces<00:01:44.909> of<00:01:44.939> one<00:01:45.240> two<00:01:45.540> three<00:01:45.990> four<00:01:46.409> five<00:01:46.649> six

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:47.310 
surfaces of one two three four five six

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:49.880 
surfaces of one two three four five six
seven<00:01:47.729> eight<00:01:48.000> blocks<00:01:48.450> so<00:01:49.320> you're<00:01:49.590> pretty<00:01:49.740> much

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:49.890 
seven eight blocks so you're pretty much

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:52.609 
seven eight blocks so you're pretty much
your<00:01:50.340> mining<00:01:50.640> for<00:01:50.820> blocks<00:01:51.090> and<00:01:51.299> you<00:01:51.450> have<00:01:51.990> 48

00:01:52.609 --> 00:01:52.619 
your mining for blocks and you have 48

00:01:52.619 --> 00:01:55.550 
your mining for blocks and you have 48
possible<00:01:53.369> blocks<00:01:54.090> I<00:01:54.299> could<00:01:54.509> have<00:01:54.659> diamond<00:01:55.110> in

00:01:55.550 --> 00:01:55.560 
possible blocks I could have diamond in

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:57.830 
possible blocks I could have diamond in
a<00:01:55.740> while<00:01:55.950> and<00:01:56.219> if<00:01:56.430> you<00:01:56.549> do<00:01:56.729> to<00:01:57.030> one<00:01:57.420> by<00:01:57.630> one

00:01:57.830 --> 00:01:57.840 
a while and if you do to one by one

00:01:57.840 --> 00:01:59.420 
a while and if you do to one by one
tunnels<00:01:58.140> with<00:01:58.259> two<00:01:58.409> blocks<00:01:58.649> in<00:01:58.799> the<00:01:58.860> middle<00:01:59.100> or

00:01:59.420 --> 00:01:59.430 
tunnels with two blocks in the middle or

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:04.730 
tunnels with two blocks in the middle or
I<00:01:59.460> guess<00:01:59.520> that's<00:01:59.850> a<00:02:00.000> 1<00:02:00.390> by<00:02:00.570> 2<00:02:00.710> u.u<00:02:01.710> mine<00:02:02.390> 1230<00:02:03.740> ok

00:02:04.730 --> 00:02:04.740 
I guess that's a 1 by 2 u.u mine 1230 ok

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:06.440 
I guess that's a 1 by 2 u.u mine 1230 ok
your<00:02:05.040> mining<00:02:05.340> for<00:02:05.520> blocks<00:02:05.790> just<00:02:06.090> like<00:02:06.270> that

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:06.450 
your mining for blocks just like that

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:12.059 
your mining for blocks just like that
and<00:02:06.659> you<00:02:07.110> see<00:02:07.409> 1<00:02:08.009> 2<00:02:08.190> 3<00:02:08.340> 4<00:02:09.000> 5<00:02:09.720> 6<00:02:09.750> 7<00:02:10.459> 8

00:02:12.059 --> 00:02:12.069 
and you see 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8

00:02:12.069 --> 00:02:15.479 
and you see 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8
9<00:02:12.219> 10<00:02:12.700> 11<00:02:12.969> 12<00:02:13.359> so<00:02:14.349> you're<00:02:14.499> seeing<00:02:14.680> four<00:02:15.129> more

00:02:15.479 --> 00:02:15.489 
9 10 11 12 so you're seeing four more

00:02:15.489 --> 00:02:17.640 
9 10 11 12 so you're seeing four more
blocks<00:02:15.670> by<00:02:16.209> minding<00:02:16.629> the<00:02:16.780> same<00:02:17.049> amount<00:02:17.349> of

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:17.650 
blocks by minding the same amount of

00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:19.229 
blocks by minding the same amount of
blocks<00:02:17.889> so<00:02:18.189> what<00:02:18.370> you're<00:02:18.489> doing<00:02:18.519> is<00:02:18.909> you're

00:02:19.229 --> 00:02:19.239 
blocks so what you're doing is you're

00:02:19.239 --> 00:02:22.110 
blocks so what you're doing is you're
saving<00:02:19.810> your<00:02:19.930> pick<00:02:20.260> you're<00:02:21.069> wasting<00:02:21.939> less

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:22.120 
saving your pick you're wasting less

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:24.539 
saving your pick you're wasting less
time<00:02:22.450> mining<00:02:22.930> like<00:02:23.049> this<00:02:23.319> the<00:02:23.950> fine<00:02:24.159> diamond

00:02:24.539 --> 00:02:24.549 
time mining like this the fine diamond

00:02:24.549 --> 00:02:25.800 
time mining like this the fine diamond
and<00:02:24.700> you're<00:02:24.790> finding<00:02:24.999> more<00:02:25.269> diamond<00:02:25.659> like

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:25.810 
and you're finding more diamond like

00:02:25.810 --> 00:02:29.550 
and you're finding more diamond like
this<00:02:25.840> now<00:02:26.799> what<00:02:27.159> I<00:02:27.340> actually<00:02:27.670> now<00:02:28.569> my<00:02:28.870> strategy

00:02:29.550 --> 00:02:29.560 
this now what I actually now my strategy

00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:31.140 
this now what I actually now my strategy
because<00:02:30.159> I<00:02:30.250> know<00:02:30.310> a<00:02:30.400> lot<00:02:30.579> of<00:02:30.639> people<00:02:30.700> do<00:02:30.969> that

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:31.150 
because I know a lot of people do that

00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:35.339 
because I know a lot of people do that
is<00:02:31.389> to<00:02:31.420> do<00:02:32.109> the<00:02:32.260> strip<00:02:32.530> mine<00:02:33.239> one<00:02:34.239> tunnel<00:02:34.540> go

00:02:35.339 --> 00:02:35.349 
is to do the strip mine one tunnel go

00:02:35.349 --> 00:02:39.330 
is to do the strip mine one tunnel go
over<00:02:35.620> three<00:02:36.099> blocks<00:02:36.489> and<00:02:36.879> then<00:02:37.750> mine<00:02:38.099> now<00:02:39.099> most

00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:39.340 
over three blocks and then mine now most

00:02:39.340 --> 00:02:40.800 
over three blocks and then mine now most
people<00:02:39.430> say<00:02:39.760> but<00:02:39.819> you<00:02:40.090> can't<00:02:40.299> see<00:02:40.450> this<00:02:40.569> block

00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:40.810 
people say but you can't see this block

00:02:40.810 --> 00:02:43.170 
people say but you can't see this block
in<00:02:40.959> the<00:02:41.019> middle<00:02:41.260> but<00:02:41.829> honestly<00:02:42.430> guys<00:02:42.579> the<00:02:42.939> odds

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:43.180 
in the middle but honestly guys the odds

00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:48.059 
in the middle but honestly guys the odds
of<00:02:43.569> you<00:02:43.780> finding<00:02:44.049> a<00:02:44.639> I<00:02:46.620> just<00:02:47.620> forgot<00:02:47.799> is<00:02:47.950> going

00:02:48.059 --> 00:02:48.069 
of you finding a I just forgot is going

00:02:48.069 --> 00:02:49.740 
of you finding a I just forgot is going
to<00:02:48.129> say<00:02:48.219> the<00:02:48.730> odds<00:02:48.909> of<00:02:49.030> you<00:02:49.150> finding<00:02:49.329> it<00:02:49.569> no<00:02:49.719> and

00:02:49.740 --> 00:02:49.750 
to say the odds of you finding it no and

00:02:49.750 --> 00:02:51.689 
to say the odds of you finding it no and
or<00:02:50.169> deposit<00:02:50.769> I<00:02:50.889> guess<00:02:51.129> I'll<00:02:51.280> just<00:02:51.310> say<00:02:51.519> that

00:02:51.689 --> 00:02:51.699 
or deposit I guess I'll just say that

00:02:51.699 --> 00:02:54.030 
or deposit I guess I'll just say that
they're<00:02:52.269> usually<00:02:52.510> they<00:02:52.930> spread<00:02:53.199> out<00:02:53.379> at<00:02:53.680> least

00:02:54.030 --> 00:02:54.040 
they're usually they spread out at least

00:02:54.040 --> 00:02:55.409 
they're usually they spread out at least
two<00:02:54.340> blocks<00:02:54.579> they<00:02:54.760> don't<00:02:54.939> there<00:02:55.120> wouldn't

00:02:55.409 --> 00:02:55.419 
two blocks they don't there wouldn't

00:02:55.419 --> 00:02:58.589 
two blocks they don't there wouldn't
just<00:02:55.540> be<00:02:55.689> one<00:02:55.989> that<00:02:56.560> stays<00:02:56.919> perfectly<00:02:57.730> in<00:02:58.269> in

00:02:58.589 --> 00:02:58.599 
just be one that stays perfectly in in

00:02:58.599 --> 00:03:00.179 
just be one that stays perfectly in in
between<00:02:59.109> these<00:02:59.319> two<00:02:59.500> walls<00:02:59.739> there's<00:02:59.980> always

00:03:00.179 --> 00:03:00.189 
between these two walls there's always

00:03:00.189 --> 00:03:01.349 
between these two walls there's always
going<00:03:00.280> to<00:03:00.340> be<00:03:00.430> a<00:03:00.489> piece<00:03:00.699> of<00:03:00.730> war<00:03:01.000> that's<00:03:01.209> on

00:03:01.349 --> 00:03:01.359 
going to be a piece of war that's on

00:03:01.359 --> 00:03:05.009 
going to be a piece of war that's on
this<00:03:01.540> wall<00:03:01.810> or<00:03:02.500> on<00:03:02.530> this<00:03:02.769> wall<00:03:03.099> I<00:03:03.370> I<00:03:04.060> mean<00:03:04.359> there

00:03:05.009 --> 00:03:05.019 
this wall or on this wall I I mean there

00:03:05.019 --> 00:03:07.020 
this wall or on this wall I I mean there
might<00:03:05.139> be<00:03:05.199> a<00:03:05.319> few<00:03:05.680> chances<00:03:06.010> but<00:03:06.310> I<00:03:06.370> can<00:03:06.879> almost

00:03:07.020 --> 00:03:07.030 
might be a few chances but I can almost

00:03:07.030 --> 00:03:09.030 
might be a few chances but I can almost
guarantee<00:03:07.299> that<00:03:07.510> there<00:03:07.719> will<00:03:07.750> never<00:03:07.959> be<00:03:08.139> a<00:03:08.500> or

00:03:09.030 --> 00:03:09.040 
guarantee that there will never be a or

00:03:09.040 --> 00:03:12.119 
guarantee that there will never be a or
that<00:03:09.340> is<00:03:09.459> just<00:03:09.909> so<00:03:10.120> along<00:03:10.540> this<00:03:10.780> line<00:03:11.109> so<00:03:11.530> what

00:03:12.119 --> 00:03:12.129 
that is just so along this line so what

00:03:12.129 --> 00:03:14.520 
that is just so along this line so what
I'm<00:03:12.219> gonna<00:03:12.340> do<00:03:12.549> is<00:03:12.579> I'm<00:03:12.939> gonna<00:03:13.319> test<00:03:14.319> out<00:03:14.500> all

00:03:14.520 --> 00:03:14.530 
I'm gonna do is I'm gonna test out all

00:03:14.530 --> 00:03:16.140 
I'm gonna do is I'm gonna test out all
these<00:03:14.829> three<00:03:15.069> ways<00:03:15.250> I'm<00:03:15.549> going<00:03:15.669> to<00:03:15.730> get<00:03:15.849> 30

00:03:16.140 --> 00:03:16.150 
these three ways I'm going to get 30

00:03:16.150 --> 00:03:19.830 
these three ways I'm going to get 30
bucks<00:03:16.290> each<00:03:17.290> way<00:03:17.620> this<00:03:18.040> way<00:03:18.280> this<00:03:18.579> way<00:03:19.060> in<00:03:19.329> this

00:03:19.830 --> 00:03:19.840 
bucks each way this way this way in this

00:03:19.840 --> 00:03:23.009 
bucks each way this way this way in this
way<00:03:20.139> so<00:03:20.979> let<00:03:21.099> me<00:03:21.159> put<00:03:21.189> that<00:03:21.370> back<00:03:21.519> and<00:03:21.810> just<00:03:22.810> see

00:03:23.009 --> 00:03:23.019 
way so let me put that back and just see

00:03:23.019 --> 00:03:24.719 
way so let me put that back and just see
what<00:03:23.500> I<00:03:23.530> find<00:03:23.799> I'm<00:03:24.009> gonna<00:03:24.159> stop<00:03:24.430> the<00:03:24.609> video

00:03:24.719 --> 00:03:24.729 
what I find I'm gonna stop the video

00:03:24.729 --> 00:03:26.399 
what I find I'm gonna stop the video
though<00:03:25.090> just<00:03:25.810> so<00:03:25.870> you<00:03:25.959> guys<00:03:26.079> don't<00:03:26.199> have<00:03:26.319> to

00:03:26.399 --> 00:03:26.409 
though just so you guys don't have to

00:03:26.409 --> 00:03:28.409 
though just so you guys don't have to
watch<00:03:26.620> that<00:03:26.650> so<00:03:27.189> um<00:03:27.639> I'll<00:03:28.090> be<00:03:28.209> back<00:03:28.389> in

watch that so um I'll be back in

00:03:28.419 --> 00:03:31.559 
watch that so um I'll be back in
probably<00:03:28.840> five<00:03:29.139> minutes<00:03:30.090> alright<00:03:31.090> I've<00:03:31.299> dug

00:03:31.559 --> 00:03:31.569 
probably five minutes alright I've dug

00:03:31.569 --> 00:03:35.879 
probably five minutes alright I've dug
all<00:03:31.959> of<00:03:32.409> the<00:03:32.530> mines<00:03:32.769> out<00:03:33.040> um<00:03:33.310> and<00:03:34.139> now<00:03:35.139> let's

00:03:35.879 --> 00:03:35.889 
all of the mines out um and now let's

00:03:35.889 --> 00:03:37.890 
all of the mines out um and now let's
count<00:03:36.159> up<00:03:36.400> what<00:03:36.609> we<00:03:36.729> got<00:03:36.879> so<00:03:37.090> this<00:03:37.239> is<00:03:37.359> the<00:03:37.569> two

00:03:37.890 --> 00:03:37.900 
count up what we got so this is the two

00:03:37.900 --> 00:03:40.409 
count up what we got so this is the two
by<00:03:38.019> two<00:03:38.079> mine<00:03:38.439> and<00:03:38.819> this<00:03:39.819> one<00:03:40.030> had<00:03:40.120> a<00:03:40.150> ton<00:03:40.389> of

00:03:40.409 --> 00:03:40.419 
by two mine and this one had a ton of

00:03:40.419 --> 00:03:43.830 
by two mine and this one had a ton of
gravel<00:03:40.689> which<00:03:41.439> I'd<00:03:42.129> the<00:03:42.459> gravel<00:03:43.239> felon<00:03:43.569> did<00:03:43.720> on

00:03:43.830 --> 00:03:43.840 
gravel which I'd the gravel felon did on

00:03:43.840 --> 00:03:44.939 
gravel which I'd the gravel felon did on
poor<00:03:44.079> stuff<00:03:44.290> and<00:03:44.409> I'm<00:03:44.470> not<00:03:44.590> going<00:03:44.739> to<00:03:44.799> count

00:03:44.939 --> 00:03:44.949 
poor stuff and I'm not going to count

00:03:44.949 --> 00:03:46.530 
poor stuff and I'm not going to count
that<00:03:45.159> because<00:03:45.519> this<00:03:45.790> is<00:03:45.939> just<00:03:45.970> for<00:03:46.269> the<00:03:46.359> sake

00:03:46.530 --> 00:03:46.540 
that because this is just for the sake

00:03:46.540 --> 00:03:49.050 
that because this is just for the sake
of<00:03:46.569> how<00:03:46.989> much<00:03:47.109> box<00:03:47.379> you<00:03:47.530> mind<00:03:47.739> so<00:03:48.340> we<00:03:48.430> found<00:03:48.669> one

00:03:49.050 --> 00:03:49.060 
of how much box you mind so we found one

00:03:49.060 --> 00:03:52.319 
of how much box you mind so we found one
thing<00:03:49.329> of<00:03:49.449> redstone<00:03:49.750> one<00:03:50.169> thing<00:03:50.379> of<00:03:50.560> iron<00:03:51.329> that

00:03:52.319 --> 00:03:52.329 
thing of redstone one thing of iron that

00:03:52.329 --> 00:03:53.460 
thing of redstone one thing of iron that
might<00:03:52.659> have<00:03:52.750> just<00:03:52.870> been<00:03:53.049> luck<00:03:53.259> that's

00:03:53.460 --> 00:03:53.470 
might have just been luck that's

00:03:53.470 --> 00:03:55.409 
might have just been luck that's
actually<00:03:53.769> a<00:03:53.829> pretty<00:03:53.859> good<00:03:54.099> find<00:03:54.459> I<00:03:54.729> didn't

00:03:55.409 --> 00:03:55.419 
actually a pretty good find I didn't

00:03:55.419 --> 00:03:56.969 
actually a pretty good find I didn't
find<00:03:55.569> diamond<00:03:55.959> in<00:03:56.049> any<00:03:56.199> of<00:03:56.349> the<00:03:56.439> tunnels<00:03:56.769> which

00:03:56.969 --> 00:03:56.979 
find diamond in any of the tunnels which

00:03:56.979 --> 00:03:58.800 
find diamond in any of the tunnels which
is<00:03:57.129> kind<00:03:57.310> of<00:03:57.430> a<00:03:57.549> bummer<00:03:57.759> but<00:03:58.150> I<00:03:58.209> did<00:03:58.419> only<00:03:58.540> dig

00:03:58.800 --> 00:03:58.810 
is kind of a bummer but I did only dig

00:03:58.810 --> 00:04:01.140 
is kind of a bummer but I did only dig
30<00:03:59.079> blocks<00:03:59.319> so<00:03:59.620> it<00:03:59.769> was<00:03:59.889> nothing<00:04:00.189> big<00:04:00.370> so<00:04:01.000> this

00:04:01.140 --> 00:04:01.150 
30 blocks so it was nothing big so this

00:04:01.150 --> 00:04:04.140 
30 blocks so it was nothing big so this
is<00:04:01.269> the<00:04:01.419> standard<00:04:02.040> strip<00:04:03.040> mining<00:04:03.250> let's<00:04:04.030> check

00:04:04.140 --> 00:04:04.150 
is the standard strip mining let's check

00:04:04.150 --> 00:04:07.000 
is the standard strip mining let's check
the<00:04:04.299> first<00:04:04.509> tunnel<00:04:04.689> we<00:04:05.530> have

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:07.010 
the first tunnel we have

00:04:07.010 --> 00:04:12.759 
the first tunnel we have
riposte<00:04:09.549> one<00:04:10.549> thing<00:04:10.760> of<00:04:10.879> iron<00:04:11.230> which<00:04:12.230> see

00:04:12.759 --> 00:04:12.769 
riposte one thing of iron which see

00:04:12.769 --> 00:04:15.100 
riposte one thing of iron which see
let's<00:04:13.159> see<00:04:13.310> if<00:04:13.370> this<00:04:13.430> iron<00:04:13.730> goes<00:04:14.030> to<00:04:14.450> the<00:04:15.019> other

00:04:15.100 --> 00:04:15.110 
let's see if this iron goes to the other

00:04:15.110 --> 00:04:19.120 
let's see if this iron goes to the other
side<00:04:15.379> yes<00:04:15.829> it<00:04:16.010> did<00:04:16.190> so<00:04:17.090> I<00:04:17.120> mean<00:04:17.630> if<00:04:18.440> I<00:04:18.680> had<00:04:18.709> dug

00:04:19.120 --> 00:04:19.130 
side yes it did so I mean if I had dug

00:04:19.130 --> 00:04:21.580 
side yes it did so I mean if I had dug
my<00:04:19.510> one<00:04:20.510> with<00:04:20.630> three<00:04:20.840> bucks<00:04:21.079> in<00:04:21.199> the<00:04:21.260> middle<00:04:21.470> I

00:04:21.580 --> 00:04:21.590 
my one with three bucks in the middle I

00:04:21.590 --> 00:04:26.110 
my one with three bucks in the middle I
would<00:04:21.799> have<00:04:21.949> seen<00:04:22.340> it<00:04:22.520> I<00:04:23.050> think<00:04:25.000> actually<00:04:26.000> no<00:04:26.090> I

00:04:26.110 --> 00:04:26.120 
would have seen it I think actually no I

00:04:26.120 --> 00:04:27.100 
would have seen it I think actually no I
wouldn't<00:04:26.300> have<00:04:26.449> seen<00:04:26.539> that<00:04:26.660> one<00:04:26.780> so<00:04:26.900> this<00:04:26.960> is

00:04:27.100 --> 00:04:27.110 
wouldn't have seen that one so this is

00:04:27.110 --> 00:04:28.779 
wouldn't have seen that one so this is
one<00:04:27.229> of<00:04:27.260> the<00:04:27.350> rare<00:04:27.590> patches<00:04:28.190> that<00:04:28.490> you

00:04:28.779 --> 00:04:28.789 
one of the rare patches that you

00:04:28.789 --> 00:04:30.279 
one of the rare patches that you
wouldn't<00:04:29.060> have<00:04:29.180> seen<00:04:29.330> by<00:04:29.510> the<00:04:29.570> three<00:04:29.840> by<00:04:29.990> three

00:04:30.279 --> 00:04:30.289 
wouldn't have seen by the three by three

00:04:30.289 --> 00:04:31.719 
wouldn't have seen by the three by three
but<00:04:30.800> since<00:04:31.010> it<00:04:31.160> is<00:04:31.220> in<00:04:31.310> the<00:04:31.400> middle<00:04:31.550> of<00:04:31.639> a

00:04:31.719 --> 00:04:31.729 
but since it is in the middle of a

00:04:31.729 --> 00:04:33.159 
but since it is in the middle of a
tunnel<00:04:32.030> you<00:04:32.300> probably<00:04:32.510> would<00:04:32.720> have<00:04:32.810> seen<00:04:33.020> it

00:04:33.159 --> 00:04:33.169 
tunnel you probably would have seen it

00:04:33.169 --> 00:04:34.420 
tunnel you probably would have seen it
it<00:04:33.260> would<00:04:33.470> have<00:04:33.590> mattered<00:04:33.740> if<00:04:33.949> it<00:04:34.130> was<00:04:34.220> in<00:04:34.340> the

00:04:34.420 --> 00:04:34.430 
it would have mattered if it was in the

00:04:34.430 --> 00:04:38.920 
it would have mattered if it was in the
very<00:04:34.520> middle<00:04:34.820> so<00:04:36.880> yeah<00:04:37.880> so<00:04:38.120> one<00:04:38.449> thing<00:04:38.600> of<00:04:38.750> iron

00:04:38.920 --> 00:04:38.930 
very middle so yeah so one thing of iron

00:04:38.930 --> 00:04:41.050 
very middle so yeah so one thing of iron
one<00:04:39.710> thing<00:04:39.889> of<00:04:39.979> redstone<00:04:40.280> which<00:04:40.639> is<00:04:40.789> actually

00:04:41.050 --> 00:04:41.060 
one thing of redstone which is actually

00:04:41.060 --> 00:04:45.700 
one thing of redstone which is actually
the<00:04:41.419> same<00:04:41.720> as<00:04:42.080> the<00:04:42.639> the<00:04:43.639> two<00:04:44.030> by<00:04:44.180> two<00:04:44.240> but<00:04:45.050> this

00:04:45.700 --> 00:04:45.710 
the same as the the two by two but this

00:04:45.710 --> 00:04:48.550 
the same as the the two by two but this
makes<00:04:45.979> the<00:04:46.160> third<00:04:46.190> thing<00:04:46.639> of<00:04:46.760> redstone<00:04:47.060> and<00:04:47.560> I

00:04:48.550 --> 00:04:48.560 
makes the third thing of redstone and I

00:04:48.560 --> 00:04:50.320 
makes the third thing of redstone and I
mean<00:04:49.100> I<00:04:49.220> mean<00:04:49.400> that<00:04:49.639> makes<00:04:49.789> the<00:04:49.910> second<00:04:50.210> thing

00:04:50.320 --> 00:04:50.330 
mean I mean that makes the second thing

00:04:50.330 --> 00:04:51.850 
mean I mean that makes the second thing
a<00:04:50.389> redstone<00:04:50.660> which<00:04:50.930> actually<00:04:51.139> puts<00:04:51.530> it<00:04:51.710> ahead

00:04:51.850 --> 00:04:51.860 
a redstone which actually puts it ahead

00:04:51.860 --> 00:04:54.879 
a redstone which actually puts it ahead
of<00:04:52.100> the<00:04:52.340> T<00:04:52.610> by<00:04:52.789> 2<00:04:52.850> months<00:04:53.300> so<00:04:53.510> so<00:04:54.229> far<00:04:54.500> this<00:04:54.740> is

00:04:54.879 --> 00:04:54.889 
of the T by 2 months so so far this is

00:04:54.889 --> 00:04:56.500 
of the T by 2 months so so far this is
leading<00:04:55.039> with<00:04:55.280> two<00:04:55.460> things<00:04:55.639> redstone<00:04:56.180> one

00:04:56.500 --> 00:04:56.510 
leading with two things redstone one

00:04:56.510 --> 00:04:59.590 
leading with two things redstone one
thing<00:04:56.720> of<00:04:56.840> iron<00:04:57.050> now<00:04:57.800> this<00:04:58.039> one<00:04:58.970> I<00:04:59.000> don't<00:04:59.300> think

00:04:59.590 --> 00:04:59.600 
thing of iron now this one I don't think

00:04:59.600 --> 00:05:01.270 
thing of iron now this one I don't think
I<00:04:59.690> actually<00:04:59.840> found<00:05:00.139> really<00:05:00.410> anything<00:05:00.650> good<00:05:01.010> in

00:05:01.270 --> 00:05:01.280 
I actually found really anything good in

00:05:01.280 --> 00:05:03.159 
I actually found really anything good in
the<00:05:01.550> three<00:05:02.210> blocks<00:05:02.449> between<00:05:02.630> them<00:05:02.930> which<00:05:03.050> is

00:05:03.159 --> 00:05:03.169 
the three blocks between them which is

00:05:03.169 --> 00:05:04.689 
the three blocks between them which is
pretty<00:05:03.410> much<00:05:03.560> my<00:05:03.620> method<00:05:04.190> of<00:05:04.250> strip<00:05:04.520> money

00:05:04.689 --> 00:05:04.699 
pretty much my method of strip money

00:05:04.699 --> 00:05:06.969 
pretty much my method of strip money
found<00:05:05.539> out<00:05:05.690> ton<00:05:05.960> of<00:05:06.080> coal<00:05:06.289> so<00:05:06.560> one<00:05:06.740> thing<00:05:06.860> a

00:05:06.969 --> 00:05:06.979 
found out ton of coal so one thing a

00:05:06.979 --> 00:05:10.810 
found out ton of coal so one thing a
coal<00:05:07.220> and<00:05:08.020> one<00:05:09.020> thing<00:05:09.229> I've<00:05:09.380> iron<00:05:09.639> one<00:05:10.639> thing

00:05:10.810 --> 00:05:10.820 
coal and one thing I've iron one thing

00:05:10.820 --> 00:05:13.360 
coal and one thing I've iron one thing
of<00:05:10.940> redstone<00:05:11.240> so<00:05:12.229> actually<00:05:12.770> it's<00:05:12.919> kind<00:05:13.250> of

00:05:13.360 --> 00:05:13.370 
of redstone so actually it's kind of

00:05:13.370 --> 00:05:21.250 
of redstone so actually it's kind of
tied<00:05:13.750> with<00:05:14.750> the<00:05:15.169> standard<00:05:15.860> strip<00:05:16.190> mining<00:05:20.260> okay

00:05:21.250 --> 00:05:21.260 
tied with the standard strip mining okay

00:05:21.260 --> 00:05:23.170 
tied with the standard strip mining okay
sorry<00:05:21.470> for<00:05:21.680> that<00:05:21.770> pause<00:05:22.039> I've<00:05:22.430> looked<00:05:22.910> over<00:05:23.030> my

00:05:26.690 --> 00:05:28.990 
dog was eating my sock so had to get
that<00:05:26.780> out<00:05:26.840> of<00:05:26.960> his<00:05:27.110> mouth<00:05:27.289> um<00:05:27.669> yeah<00:05:28.669> so<00:05:28.820> what<00:05:28.970> I

00:05:28.990 --> 00:05:29.000 
that out of his mouth um yeah so what I

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:30.460 
that out of his mouth um yeah so what I
would<00:05:29.150> just<00:05:29.270> want<00:05:29.419> to<00:05:29.479> check<00:05:29.690> is<00:05:29.930> the<00:05:29.990> only

00:05:30.460 --> 00:05:30.470 
would just want to check is the only

00:05:30.470 --> 00:05:31.900 
would just want to check is the only
reason<00:05:30.650> people<00:05:30.830> don't<00:05:30.979> do<00:05:31.220> this<00:05:31.340> is<00:05:31.550> because<00:05:31.669> I

00:05:31.900 --> 00:05:31.910 
reason people don't do this is because I

00:05:31.910 --> 00:05:33.189 
reason people don't do this is because I
always<00:05:32.060> say<00:05:32.270> that<00:05:32.419> you<00:05:32.539> miss<00:05:32.690> box<00:05:32.990> in<00:05:33.139> the

00:05:33.189 --> 00:05:33.199 
always say that you miss box in the

00:05:33.199 --> 00:05:35.050 
always say that you miss box in the
middle<00:05:33.320> so<00:05:33.949> I'm<00:05:34.010> gonna<00:05:34.130> check<00:05:34.460> and<00:05:34.490> see<00:05:34.729> if<00:05:34.970> I

00:05:35.050 --> 00:05:35.060 
middle so I'm gonna check and see if I

00:05:35.060 --> 00:05:37.480 
middle so I'm gonna check and see if I
do<00:05:35.120> miss<00:05:35.599> any<00:05:35.780> box<00:05:36.080> or<00:05:36.440> any<00:05:36.680> oars<00:05:37.039> in<00:05:37.460> the

00:05:37.480 --> 00:05:37.490 
do miss any box or any oars in the

00:05:37.490 --> 00:05:39.700 
do miss any box or any oars in the
middle<00:05:37.820> and<00:05:37.970> I'm<00:05:38.479> kind<00:05:38.750> of<00:05:38.780> thinking<00:05:38.900> I<00:05:39.320> might

00:05:39.700 --> 00:05:39.710 
middle and I'm kind of thinking I might

00:05:39.710 --> 00:05:42.279 
middle and I'm kind of thinking I might
miss<00:05:39.919> maybe<00:05:40.190> one<00:05:40.550> let's<00:05:41.120> see<00:05:41.389> there<00:05:41.810> was<00:05:41.840> there

00:05:42.279 --> 00:05:42.289 
miss maybe one let's see there was there

00:05:42.289 --> 00:05:46.870 
miss maybe one let's see there was there
some<00:05:42.470> redstone<00:05:42.650> won't<00:05:43.039> like<00:05:43.160> us<00:05:43.310> up<00:05:43.490> um<00:05:44.620> and<00:05:45.880> i

00:05:46.870 --> 00:05:46.880 
some redstone won't like us up um and i

00:05:46.880 --> 00:05:49.899 
some redstone won't like us up um and i
don't<00:05:47.810> think<00:05:48.050> i<00:05:48.139> saw<00:05:48.349> this<00:05:48.530> another<00:05:48.860> one<00:05:49.070> no<00:05:49.880> i

00:05:49.899 --> 00:05:49.909 
don't think i saw this another one no i

00:05:49.909 --> 00:05:51.129 
don't think i saw this another one no i
wouldn't<00:05:50.240> have<00:05:50.389> seen<00:05:50.539> it<00:05:50.659> because<00:05:50.900> i<00:05:50.930> was

00:05:51.129 --> 00:05:51.139 
wouldn't have seen it because i was

00:05:51.139 --> 00:05:53.439 
wouldn't have seen it because i was
right<00:05:51.289> there<00:05:51.500> so<00:05:51.530> it<00:05:52.370> did<00:05:52.580> go<00:05:52.789> into<00:05:53.120> the<00:05:53.330> other

00:05:53.439 --> 00:05:53.449 
right there so it did go into the other

00:05:53.449 --> 00:05:55.120 
right there so it did go into the other
side<00:05:53.750> but<00:05:53.990> i<00:05:54.050> just<00:05:54.260> hadn't<00:05:54.590> dug<00:05:54.740> up<00:05:54.919> high

00:05:55.120 --> 00:05:55.130 
side but i just hadn't dug up high

00:05:55.130 --> 00:05:57.310 
side but i just hadn't dug up high
enough<00:05:55.250> to<00:05:55.490> actually<00:05:55.580> see<00:05:56.030> it<00:05:56.120> i<00:05:56.360> would<00:05:57.110> have

00:05:57.310 --> 00:05:57.320 
enough to actually see it i would have

00:05:57.320 --> 00:06:00.879 
enough to actually see it i would have
though<00:05:57.530> um<00:05:59.080> another<00:06:00.080> thing<00:06:00.169> of<00:06:00.380> redstone<00:06:00.650> by

00:06:00.879 --> 00:06:00.889 
though um another thing of redstone by

00:06:00.889 --> 00:06:05.439 
though um another thing of redstone by
this<00:06:01.039> i<00:06:01.190> did<00:06:01.340> see<00:06:01.550> on<00:06:01.699> that<00:06:01.820> side<00:06:03.669> this<00:06:04.669> is<00:06:04.880> this

00:06:05.439 --> 00:06:05.449 
this i did see on that side this is this

00:06:05.449 --> 00:06:07.390 
this i did see on that side this is this
is<00:06:05.599> why<00:06:05.840> i<00:06:05.870> do<00:06:06.169> the<00:06:06.470> three<00:06:06.710> blocks<00:06:06.979> and<00:06:07.310> then

00:06:07.390 --> 00:06:07.400 
is why i do the three blocks and then

00:06:07.400 --> 00:06:08.010 
is why i do the three blocks and then
that

00:06:08.010 --> 00:06:08.020 
that

00:06:08.020 --> 00:06:10.670 
that
be<00:06:08.349> it<00:06:08.979> have<00:06:09.430> the<00:06:09.610> stuff<00:06:09.819> that<00:06:09.970> I<00:06:10.000> didn't<00:06:10.180> see

00:06:10.670 --> 00:06:10.680 
be it have the stuff that I didn't see

00:06:10.680 --> 00:06:15.980 
be it have the stuff that I didn't see
it<00:06:11.680> should<00:06:11.889> just<00:06:12.009> be<00:06:12.129> that<00:06:12.310> one<00:06:12.520> redstone<00:06:12.759> I

00:06:15.980 --> 00:06:15.990 

00:06:15.990 --> 00:06:17.969 

think<00:06:16.990> this<00:06:17.050> is<00:06:17.110> about<00:06:17.319> to<00:06:17.560> the<00:06:17.680> end<00:06:17.800> of<00:06:17.919> the

00:06:17.969 --> 00:06:17.979 
think this is about to the end of the

00:06:17.979 --> 00:06:21.420 
think this is about to the end of the
mine<00:06:19.199> what<00:06:20.199> if<00:06:20.289> my<00:06:20.349> father<00:06:20.530> will<00:06:20.770> just<00:06:20.800> check

00:06:21.420 --> 00:06:21.430 
mine what if my father will just check

00:06:21.430 --> 00:06:25.740 
mine what if my father will just check
to<00:06:21.520> be<00:06:21.639> sure<00:06:23.370> they're<00:06:24.370> dirt<00:06:24.759> dirt<00:06:25.060> stone<00:06:25.479> so

00:06:25.740 --> 00:06:25.750 
to be sure they're dirt dirt stone so

00:06:25.750 --> 00:06:28.230 
to be sure they're dirt dirt stone so
I'll<00:06:25.870> name<00:06:26.050> is<00:06:26.199> one<00:06:26.409> thing<00:06:26.590> of<00:06:26.710> redstone<00:06:27.009> and<00:06:27.310> I

00:06:28.230 --> 00:06:28.240 
I'll name is one thing of redstone and I

00:06:28.240 --> 00:06:30.779 
I'll name is one thing of redstone and I
found<00:06:28.539> I<00:06:29.080> got<00:06:29.800> kind<00:06:29.889> of<00:06:29.979> a<00:06:30.099> lucky<00:06:30.400> I<00:06:30.430> found<00:06:30.639> the

00:06:30.779 --> 00:06:30.789 
found I got kind of a lucky I found the

00:06:30.789 --> 00:06:32.939 
found I got kind of a lucky I found the
same<00:06:31.030> amount<00:06:31.180> of<00:06:31.449> veins<00:06:32.379> as<00:06:32.650> I<00:06:32.740> would<00:06:32.860> have

00:06:32.939 --> 00:06:32.949 
same amount of veins as I would have

00:06:32.949 --> 00:06:35.100 
same amount of veins as I would have
found<00:06:33.129> with<00:06:33.490> the<00:06:33.520> two<00:06:33.849> by<00:06:34.000> two<00:06:34.060> but<00:06:34.900> that's

00:06:35.100 --> 00:06:35.110 
found with the two by two but that's

00:06:35.110 --> 00:06:37.140 
found with the two by two but that's
just<00:06:35.229> how<00:06:35.440> I<00:06:35.470> mind<00:06:35.830> guys<00:06:36.009> I<00:06:36.069> think<00:06:36.819> it's<00:06:36.940> most

00:06:37.140 --> 00:06:37.150 
just how I mind guys I think it's most

00:06:37.150 --> 00:06:40.200 
just how I mind guys I think it's most
effective<00:06:37.240> way<00:06:37.629> to<00:06:37.659> mine<00:06:37.930> for<00:06:38.919> diamond<00:06:39.610> people

00:06:40.200 --> 00:06:40.210 
effective way to mine for diamond people

00:06:40.210 --> 00:06:41.909 
effective way to mine for diamond people
will<00:06:40.330> argue<00:06:40.419> that<00:06:40.870> TT<00:06:41.319> is<00:06:41.440> the<00:06:41.560> most<00:06:41.740> effective

00:06:41.909 --> 00:06:41.919 
will argue that TT is the most effective

00:06:41.919 --> 00:06:44.670 
will argue that TT is the most effective
way<00:06:42.250> but<00:06:42.970> if<00:06:43.690> you<00:06:43.870> want<00:06:44.050> to<00:06:44.110> blow<00:06:44.259> up<00:06:44.380> all<00:06:44.530> your

00:06:44.670 --> 00:06:44.680 
way but if you want to blow up all your

00:06:44.680 --> 00:06:46.830 
way but if you want to blow up all your
diamond<00:06:45.310> yeah<00:06:45.490> go<00:06:45.699> ahead<00:06:45.789> and<00:06:45.970> use<00:06:46.060> TNT<00:06:46.300> but

00:06:46.830 --> 00:06:46.840 
diamond yeah go ahead and use TNT but

00:06:46.840 --> 00:06:48.270 
diamond yeah go ahead and use TNT but
that's<00:06:47.199> definitely<00:06:47.500> not<00:06:47.800> the<00:06:47.919> most<00:06:48.039> effective

00:06:48.270 --> 00:06:48.280 
that's definitely not the most effective

00:06:48.280 --> 00:06:50.820 
that's definitely not the most effective
way<00:06:48.610> to<00:06:48.789> mine<00:06:49.090> so<00:06:49.690> I'll<00:06:50.409> see<00:06:50.470> you<00:06:50.650> guys<00:06:50.710> later
