an off hand it doesn't look like you see
much<00:01:01.020> calcium<00:01:01.940> but<00:01:02.940> look<00:01:04.250> perhaps<00:01:05.250> I<00:01:05.430> can

00:01:05.479 --> 00:01:05.489 
much calcium but look perhaps I can

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:07.990 
much calcium but look perhaps I can
convince<00:01:05.820> you

00:01:07.990 --> 00:01:08.000 
convince you

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:10.150 
convince you
I<00:01:08.060> don't<00:01:08.780> know<00:01:08.870> these<00:01:09.080> maybe<00:01:09.350> cells<00:01:09.800> rather

00:01:10.150 --> 00:01:10.160

00:01:12.490 --> 00:01:12.500 
than calcium there may be some fine

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:14.950 
than calcium there may be some fine

sniffles of early calcium here but for

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:18.120 
sniffles of early calcium here but for

the most part that artery is not

00:01:18.130 --> 00:01:23.100 
the most part that artery is not
calcified<00:01:19.130> too<00:01:19.880> much<00:01:21.010> the<00:01:22.010> concept<00:01:22.640> of

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:23.110 
calcified too much the concept of

00:01:23.110 --> 00:01:30.510 
calcified too much the concept of
recanalization<00:01:24.130> is<00:01:25.130> simply<00:01:25.910> this<00:01:28.420> very<00:01:29.420> often

00:01:30.510 --> 00:01:30.520 
recanalization is simply this very often

00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:34.230 
recanalization is simply this very often
the<00:01:31.520> plaques<00:01:32.150> and<00:01:32.570> here's<00:01:32.990> a<00:01:33.050> huge<00:01:33.619> plaque

00:01:34.230 --> 00:01:34.240 
the plaques and here's a huge plaque

00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:36.969 
the plaques and here's a huge plaque
involving<00:01:35.240> a<00:01:35.390> very<00:01:35.690> significant<00:01:36.410> portion<00:01:36.650> of

involving a very significant portion of
a<00:01:37.070> large<00:01:37.250> artery<00:01:37.810> very<00:01:38.810> often<00:01:39.260> these<00:01:39.470> plaques

00:01:39.880 --> 00:01:39.890 
a large artery very often these plaques

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:44.230 
a large artery very often these plaques
are<00:01:40.810> realized<00:01:41.810> and<00:01:42.229> what<00:01:42.830> does<00:01:42.950> that<00:01:42.979> mean<00:01:43.460> it

00:01:44.230 --> 00:01:44.240 
are realized and what does that mean it

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:47.710 
are realized and what does that mean it
means<00:01:44.330> that<00:01:44.780> even<00:01:44.990> though<00:01:45.380> some<00:01:46.420> most<00:01:47.420> are

00:01:47.710 --> 00:01:47.720 
means that even though some most are

00:01:47.720 --> 00:01:50.820 
means that even though some most are
perhaps<00:01:48.110> all<00:01:48.350> of<00:01:48.830> the<00:01:49.070> blood<00:01:49.310> vessel<00:01:49.790> is

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:50.830 
perhaps all of the blood vessel is

00:01:50.830 --> 00:01:54.660 
perhaps all of the blood vessel is
thrombosed<00:01:51.830> or<00:01:52.360> occluded<00:01:53.360> by<00:01:53.390> this<00:01:53.840> plaque

00:01:54.670 --> 00:01:58.540 
thrombosed or occluded by this plaque
very<00:01:55.670> often<00:01:56.210> you<00:01:56.420> can<00:01:56.600> start<00:01:56.899> to<00:01:57.110> get<00:01:57.320> flow<00:01:58.250> of

00:01:58.540 --> 00:01:58.550 
very often you can start to get flow of

00:01:58.550 --> 00:02:01.450 
very often you can start to get flow of
blood<00:01:58.940> through<00:01:59.330> it<00:01:59.930> that<00:02:00.530> is<00:02:00.710> recanalization

00:02:01.450 --> 00:02:01.460 
blood through it that is recanalization

00:02:01.460 --> 00:02:06.070 
blood through it that is recanalization
as<00:02:02.390> a<00:02:02.450> normal<00:02:03.160> reactive<00:02:04.160> process<00:02:04.840> and<00:02:05.840> it

00:02:06.070 --> 00:02:06.080 
as a normal reactive process and it

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:10.389 
as a normal reactive process and it
occurs<00:02:06.440> very<00:02:06.830> often<00:02:07.729> and<00:02:08.530> not<00:02:09.530> only<00:02:09.890> is<00:02:10.009> this<00:02:10.130> a

00:02:10.389 --> 00:02:10.399 
occurs very often and not only is this a

00:02:10.399 --> 00:02:12.850 
occurs very often and not only is this a
wreak<00:02:10.789> analyzed<00:02:11.480> area<00:02:12.049> within<00:02:12.350> a<00:02:12.590> large

00:02:12.850 --> 00:02:12.860 
wreak analyzed area within a large

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:14.590 
wreak analyzed area within a large
plaque<00:02:13.250> but<00:02:13.519> you<00:02:13.670> can<00:02:13.820> see<00:02:14.000> that<00:02:14.209> there<00:02:14.450> is

00:02:14.590 --> 00:02:14.600 
plaque but you can see that there is

00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:17.350 
plaque but you can see that there is
some<00:02:14.900> Oh<00:02:15.140> probably<00:02:15.860> degenerated<00:02:16.850> blood<00:02:17.090> or

00:02:17.350 --> 00:02:17.360 
some Oh probably degenerated blood or

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:19.780 
some Oh probably degenerated blood or
further<00:02:17.690> plaque<00:02:18.200> within<00:02:18.650> here<00:02:18.950> so<00:02:19.580> the<00:02:19.760> only

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:19.790 
further plaque within here so the only

00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:22.060 
further plaque within here so the only
thing<00:02:20.120> I<00:02:20.239> wanted<00:02:20.630> to<00:02:20.780> demonstrate<00:02:21.380> in<00:02:21.890> this

00:02:22.060 --> 00:02:22.070 
thing I wanted to demonstrate in this

00:02:22.070 --> 00:02:23.830 
thing I wanted to demonstrate in this
way<00:02:22.280> because<00:02:22.880> it's<00:02:23.060> called<00:02:23.299> recanalization

00:02:23.830 --> 00:02:23.840 
way because it's called recanalization

00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:29.080 
way because it's called recanalization
is<00:02:24.709> the<00:02:25.519> concept<00:02:26.239> of<00:02:26.480> recanalization
