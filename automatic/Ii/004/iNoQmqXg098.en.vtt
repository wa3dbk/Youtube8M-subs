year will give you the performance of
this<00:04:51.030> year<00:04:51.319> much<00:04:52.319> like<00:04:52.650> adding<00:04:52.979> twice<00:04:53.220> the

00:04:53.360 --> 00:04:53.370 
this year much like adding twice the

00:04:53.370 --> 00:04:55.159 
this year much like adding twice the
memory<00:04:53.490> to<00:04:53.759> a<00:04:53.789> raspberry<00:04:54.210> pi<00:04:54.300> I<00:04:54.810> have<00:04:55.110> a

00:04:55.159 --> 00:04:55.169 
memory to a raspberry pi I have a

00:04:55.169 --> 00:04:57.080 
memory to a raspberry pi I have a
feeling<00:04:55.500> that<00:04:55.530> going<00:04:55.830> with<00:04:55.949> quad-core<00:04:56.280> faster

00:04:57.080 --> 00:04:57.090 
feeling that going with quad-core faster

00:04:57.090 --> 00:04:59.059 
feeling that going with quad-core faster
GPU<00:04:57.270> and<00:04:57.599> more<00:04:57.720> memory<00:04:58.080> which<00:04:58.740> is<00:04:58.860> really

00:04:59.059 --> 00:04:59.069 
GPU and more memory which is really

00:04:59.069 --> 00:05:00.740 
GPU and more memory which is really
what's<00:04:59.310> in<00:04:59.430> most<00:04:59.610> smartphones<00:05:00.060> nowadays<00:05:00.270> is

00:05:00.740 --> 00:05:00.750 
what's in most smartphones nowadays is

00:05:00.750 --> 00:05:03.050 
what's in most smartphones nowadays is
the<00:05:01.409> experience<00:05:01.680> you'll<00:05:01.979> have<00:05:02.130> being<00:05:02.819> matched

00:05:03.050 --> 00:05:03.060 
the experience you'll have being matched

00:05:03.060 --> 00:05:05.360 
the experience you'll have being matched
more<00:05:03.569> closely<00:05:03.840> I<00:05:03.990> think<00:05:04.229> on<00:05:04.530> a<00:05:04.560> TV<00:05:04.830> which<00:05:05.250> is

00:05:05.360 --> 00:05:05.370 
more closely I think on a TV which is

00:05:05.370 --> 00:05:07.309 
more closely I think on a TV which is
good<00:05:05.520> you<00:05:06.000> have<00:05:06.240> one<00:05:06.419> coming<00:05:06.630> in<00:05:06.900> you'll<00:05:07.169> be

00:05:07.309 --> 00:05:07.319 
good you have one coming in you'll be

00:05:07.319 --> 00:05:08.749 
good you have one coming in you'll be
don't<00:05:07.530> sparking<00:05:07.949> this<00:05:08.069> and<00:05:08.250> take<00:05:08.340> a<00:05:08.400> look<00:05:08.610> at

00:05:08.749 --> 00:05:08.759 
don't sparking this and take a look at

00:05:08.759 --> 00:05:11.089 
don't sparking this and take a look at
it<00:05:08.789> we<00:05:09.060> will<00:05:09.210> show<00:05:09.389> you<00:05:09.449> with<00:05:10.409> the<00:05:10.650> expansion

kit that along with the TV to actually
plug<00:05:14.310> it<00:05:14.460> into<00:05:14.580> so<00:05:14.909> you'll<00:05:15.090> actually<00:05:15.210> be<00:05:15.659> able

00:05:15.860 --> 00:05:15.870 
plug it into so you'll actually be able

to go back and forth to see how was it
before<00:05:18.060> do<00:05:18.539> we<00:05:18.659> really<00:05:18.690> notice<00:05:19.139> a<00:05:19.199> difference

00:05:19.339 --> 00:05:19.349 
before do we really notice a difference

00:05:19.349 --> 00:05:20.749 
before do we really notice a difference
afterwards<00:05:20.009> and<00:05:20.190> we'll<00:05:20.280> be<00:05:20.370> able<00:05:20.430> to<00:05:20.580> show<00:05:20.669> you

00:05:22.620 --> 00:05:24.439 
that live because you know traditionally
like<00:05:22.860> wait<00:05:23.130> in<00:05:23.250> three<00:05:23.490> years<00:05:23.729> usually<00:05:24.270> a<00:05:24.300> much

00:05:24.439 --> 00:05:24.449 
like wait in three years usually a much

00:05:24.449 --> 00:05:25.939 
like wait in three years usually a much
more<00:05:24.629> notable<00:05:24.930> difference<00:05:25.289> than<00:05:25.469> waiting<00:05:25.620> one

00:05:25.939 --> 00:05:25.949 
more notable difference than waiting one

00:05:25.949 --> 00:05:28.159 
more notable difference than waiting one
year<00:05:26.219> totally<00:05:26.669> and<00:05:26.879> they<00:05:27.389> keep<00:05:27.599> making<00:05:27.900> these

00:05:28.159 --> 00:05:28.169 
year totally and they keep making these

00:05:28.169 --> 00:05:29.930 
year totally and they keep making these
for<00:05:28.379> a<00:05:28.440> few<00:05:28.650> more<00:05:28.770> years<00:05:28.919> I<00:05:29.159> hope<00:05:29.370> so<00:05:29.669> and

00:05:29.930 --> 00:05:29.940 
for a few more years I hope so and

00:05:29.940 --> 00:05:31.760 
for a few more years I hope so and
because<00:05:30.090> it<00:05:30.330> gives<00:05:30.449> people<00:05:30.690> who<00:05:30.960> bought<00:05:31.560> the
