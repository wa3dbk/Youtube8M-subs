00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:35.440 
is that in the subcompact market the

users have been forced to make a choice
they<00:00:37.660> either<00:00:37.780> stay<00:00:37.989> in<00:00:38.500> a<00:00:38.620> subcompact<00:00:39.100> tool

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:39.580 
they either stay in a subcompact tool

00:00:39.580 --> 00:00:41.520 
they either stay in a subcompact tool
you<00:00:40.210> get<00:00:40.330> a<00:00:40.360> tool<00:00:40.629> that<00:00:40.809> is<00:00:40.930> very<00:00:41.170> small

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:41.530 
you get a tool that is very small

00:00:41.530 --> 00:00:43.500 
you get a tool that is very small
undersized<00:00:42.190> and<00:00:42.269> underwhelming<00:00:43.269> from<00:00:43.480> a

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:46.180 
performance standpoint or they have to

00:00:46.180 --> 00:00:47.640 
performance standpoint or they have to
step<00:00:46.390> out<00:00:46.600> of<00:00:46.720> the<00:00:46.809> battery<00:00:47.170> platform

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:47.650 
step out of the battery platform

00:00:47.650 --> 00:00:50.759 
step out of the battery platform
entirely<00:00:48.010> and<00:00:48.460> step<00:00:48.729> up<00:00:48.909> step<00:00:49.600> up<00:00:49.870> voltage<00:00:50.350> and

entirely and step up step up voltage and

00:00:50.769 --> 00:00:52.979 
entirely and step up step up voltage and
get<00:00:50.949> a<00:00:50.979> tool<00:00:51.280> that<00:00:51.460> is<00:00:51.610> that<00:00:52.150> can<00:00:52.299> be<00:00:52.420> oversized

00:00:52.979 --> 00:00:52.989 
get a tool that is that can be oversized

00:00:52.989 --> 00:00:56.100 
get a tool that is that can be oversized
and<00:00:53.860> more<00:00:54.100> cumbersome<00:00:54.519> cumbersome<00:00:55.210> than<00:00:55.869> what

00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:56.110 
and more cumbersome cumbersome than what

00:00:56.110 --> 00:00:57.899 
and more cumbersome cumbersome than what
it<00:00:56.260> should<00:00:56.290> be<00:00:56.710> provided<00:00:57.309> in<00:00:57.430> the<00:00:57.519> subcompact

it should be provided in the subcompact

00:00:57.909 --> 00:01:00.420 
it should be provided in the subcompact

some in the subcompact category you have

00:01:45.460 --> 00:01:49.200 
some in the subcompact category you have
two<00:01:45.789> solutions<00:01:46.649> very<00:01:47.649> small<00:01:47.979> tools<00:01:48.280> not<00:01:48.969> much

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:49.210 
two solutions very small tools not much

00:01:49.210 --> 00:01:52.050 
two solutions very small tools not much
got<00:01:49.450> capacity<00:01:49.899> not<00:01:50.049> much<00:01:50.259> performance<00:01:51.249> all

00:01:52.050 --> 00:01:52.060 
got capacity not much performance all

00:01:52.060 --> 00:01:53.310 
got capacity not much performance all
the<00:01:52.119> way<00:01:52.299> to<00:01:52.359> show<00:01:52.659> you

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:53.320 
the way to show you

00:01:53.320 --> 00:01:56.880 
the way to show you
just<00:01:53.440> one<00:01:53.620> of<00:01:53.650> them<00:01:53.800> here<00:01:54.750> and<00:01:55.750> and<00:01:56.560> this<00:01:56.740> is

00:01:56.880 --> 00:01:56.890 
just one of them here and and this is

00:01:56.890 --> 00:01:59.030 
just one of them here and and this is
obviously<00:01:57.550> just<00:01:57.640> a<00:01:57.909> standard<00:01:58.210> dimensional

00:01:59.030 --> 00:01:59.040 
obviously just a standard dimensional

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:00.840 
obviously just a standard dimensional
dimensional<00:02:00.040> lumber<00:02:00.130> to<00:02:00.460> blackboard

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:00.850 
dimensional lumber to blackboard

00:02:00.850 --> 00:02:08.310 
dimensional lumber to blackboard
material<00:02:06.510> so<00:02:07.510> you<00:02:07.570> can<00:02:07.840> get<00:02:07.990> through<00:02:08.200> the

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:08.320 
material so you can get through the

00:02:08.320 --> 00:02:09.960 
material so you can get through the
material<00:02:08.440> obviously<00:02:09.070> you<00:02:09.490> don't<00:02:09.640> have<00:02:09.789> the

00:02:09.960 --> 00:02:09.970 
material obviously you don't have the

00:02:09.970 --> 00:02:11.550 
material obviously you don't have the
time<00:02:10.179> capacity<00:02:10.479> to<00:02:10.810> get<00:02:10.929> through<00:02:11.140> that<00:02:11.320> a

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:11.560 
time capacity to get through that a

00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:16.610 
time capacity to get through that a
standard<00:02:11.980> 2x4<00:02:13.440> the<00:02:14.440> motive<00:02:14.740> really<00:02:14.860> strange

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:16.620 
standard 2x4 the motive really strange

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:19.020 
standard 2x4 the motive really strange
now<00:02:17.620> I'll<00:02:17.860> show<00:02:18.100> you<00:02:18.130> twelve<00:02:18.640> well<00:02:18.790> if<00:02:18.880> you

00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:19.030 
now I'll show you twelve well if you

00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:25.770 
now I'll show you twelve well if you
want<00:02:19.209> like<00:02:22.770> so<00:02:23.770> you<00:02:23.860> can<00:02:24.070> easily<00:02:24.550> see<00:02:24.820> that<00:02:24.850> the

00:02:25.770 --> 00:02:25.780 
want like so you can easily see that the

00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:27.660 
want like so you can easily see that the
capacities<00:02:26.709> there<00:02:26.920> that<00:02:27.160> isn't<00:02:27.520> there

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:27.670 
capacities there that isn't there

00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:30.120 
capacities there that isn't there
currently<00:02:28.150> in<00:02:28.300> the<00:02:28.390> subcompact<00:02:28.810> market<00:02:29.290> and

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:30.130 
currently in the subcompact market and

00:02:30.130 --> 00:02:31.680 
currently in the subcompact market and
it<00:02:30.340> hasn't<00:02:30.520> performance<00:02:31.090> to<00:02:31.209> get<00:02:31.330> through<00:02:31.540> the

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:31.690 
it hasn't performance to get through the

00:02:31.690 --> 00:02:41.380 
it hasn't performance to get through the
through<00:02:32.350> the<00:02:32.440> material

00:02:41.380 --> 00:02:41.390 

00:02:41.390 --> 00:02:44.020 

so<00:02:42.260> you<00:02:42.350> can<00:02:42.560> see<00:02:42.770> them<00:02:42.950> it's<00:02:43.730> really

00:02:44.020 --> 00:02:44.030 
so you can see them it's really

00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:45.670 
so you can see them it's really
overloading<00:02:44.660> this<00:02:44.750> tool<00:02:44.990> and<00:02:45.080> I'm<00:02:45.200> not<00:02:45.440> really

00:02:45.670 --> 00:02:45.680 
overloading this tool and I'm not really

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:48.810 
overloading this tool and I'm not really
pushing<00:02:45.980> on<00:02:46.190> it<00:02:46.310> very<00:02:46.400> hard<00:02:46.520> at<00:02:46.790> all<00:02:47.200> not<00:02:48.200> what

00:02:48.810 --> 00:02:48.820 
pushing on it very hard at all not what

00:02:48.820 --> 00:02:51.070 
pushing on it very hard at all not what
what<00:02:49.820> people<00:02:50.150> really<00:02:50.510> deserve<00:02:50.840> on<00:02:50.990> the

00:02:51.070 --> 00:02:51.080 
what people really deserve on the

00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:53.170 
what people really deserve on the
jobsite<00:02:51.320> today<00:02:51.590> and<00:02:52.460> again<00:02:52.790> I'll<00:02:52.910> show<00:02:52.940> you

00:02:53.170 --> 00:02:53.180 
jobsite today and again I'll show you

00:02:53.180 --> 00:03:07.530 
jobsite today and again I'll show you
that<00:02:53.390> the<00:02:53.630> 12<00:02:53.870> volt<00:02:54.050> fuel<00:02:54.260> sir

00:03:07.530 --> 00:03:07.540 

00:03:07.540 --> 00:03:10.570 

so<00:03:08.540> with<00:03:08.690> this<00:03:08.840> in<00:03:09.710> this<00:03:09.920> application

00:03:10.570 --> 00:03:10.580 
so with this in this application

00:03:10.580 --> 00:03:12.520 
so with this in this application
obviously<00:03:10.760> when<00:03:11.660> we<00:03:11.780> came<00:03:11.960> into<00:03:12.140> this<00:03:12.290> project

00:03:12.520 --> 00:03:12.530 
obviously when we came into this project

00:03:12.530 --> 00:03:15.760 
obviously when we came into this project
we<00:03:12.920> knew<00:03:13.070> that<00:03:13.220> it<00:03:13.370> needed<00:03:13.580> to<00:03:13.760> accomplish<00:03:14.770> two

00:03:15.760 --> 00:03:15.770 
we knew that it needed to accomplish two

00:03:15.770 --> 00:03:17.620 
we knew that it needed to accomplish two
basic<00:03:16.190> tasks<00:03:16.610> and<00:03:16.730> cutting<00:03:17.060> dimensional

00:03:17.620 --> 00:03:17.630 
basic tasks and cutting dimensional

00:03:17.630 --> 00:03:19.950 
basic tasks and cutting dimensional
lumber<00:03:17.780> and<00:03:18.080> sheet<00:03:18.290> guns<00:03:18.530> were<00:03:19.130> the<00:03:19.250> primary

00:03:19.950 --> 00:03:19.960 
lumber and sheet guns were the primary

00:03:19.960 --> 00:03:22.180 
lumber and sheet guns were the primary
applications<00:03:20.960> that<00:03:21.110> we<00:03:21.200> took<00:03:21.380> that<00:03:21.920> we<00:03:22.010> went

00:03:22.180 --> 00:03:22.190 
applications that we took that we went

00:03:22.190 --> 00:03:24.340 
applications that we took that we went
to<00:03:22.310> action<00:03:22.640> with<00:03:22.790> with<00:03:23.030> this<00:03:23.150> project<00:03:23.660> and

00:03:24.340 --> 00:03:24.350 
to action with with this project and

00:03:24.350 --> 00:03:25.450 
to action with with this project and
we're<00:03:24.470> going<00:03:24.590> to<00:03:24.680> directly<00:03:25.010> compare

00:03:25.450 --> 00:03:25.460 
we're going to directly compare

00:03:25.460 --> 00:03:27.520 
we're going to directly compare
ourselves<00:03:25.550> to<00:03:25.910> a<00:03:26.030> table<00:03:26.510> and<00:03:26.840> in<00:03:27.350> this

00:03:27.520 --> 00:03:27.530 
ourselves to a table and in this

00:03:27.530 --> 00:03:29.520 
ourselves to a table and in this
situation<00:03:27.770> we<00:03:28.220> compared<00:03:28.760> ourselves<00:03:28.880> to<00:03:29.270> two

00:03:29.520 --> 00:03:29.530 
situation we compared ourselves to two

00:03:29.530 --> 00:03:33.040 
situation we compared ourselves to two
18-volt<00:03:30.530> tools<00:03:30.860> one<00:03:31.220> of<00:03:31.310> which<00:03:31.460> being<00:03:32.050> very

00:03:33.040 --> 00:03:33.050 
18-volt tools one of which being very

00:03:33.050 --> 00:03:35.320 
18-volt tools one of which being very
similar<00:03:33.440> saw<00:03:33.680> size<00:03:33.920> and<00:03:34.280> a<00:03:34.370> standard<00:03:34.700> three

00:03:35.320 --> 00:03:35.330 
similar saw size and a standard three

00:03:35.330 --> 00:03:38.050 
similar saw size and a standard three
and<00:03:35.540> our<00:03:35.750> lithium<00:03:35.960> tool<00:03:36.380> and<00:03:36.710> we<00:03:37.220> we<00:03:37.670> exceed

00:03:38.050 --> 00:03:38.060 
and our lithium tool and we we exceed

00:03:38.060 --> 00:03:41.170 
and our lithium tool and we we exceed
the<00:03:38.930> cut<00:03:39.530> were<00:03:40.070> able<00:03:40.310> to<00:03:40.370> deliver<00:03:40.640> more<00:03:40.760> cuts

00:03:41.170 --> 00:03:41.180 
the cut were able to deliver more cuts

00:03:41.180 --> 00:03:43.360 
the cut were able to deliver more cuts
per<00:03:41.390> charge<00:03:41.660> than<00:03:41.990> a<00:03:42.230> standard<00:03:42.830> 80<00:03:43.010> volt

per charge than a standard 80 volt
lithium<00:03:43.820> tool<00:03:44.060> and<00:03:44.660> we<00:03:44.750> far<00:03:45.020> exceed<00:03:45.670> the

00:03:46.660 --> 00:03:46.670 
lithium tool and we far exceed the

00:03:46.670 --> 00:03:49.210 
lithium tool and we far exceed the
performance<00:03:46.880> in<00:03:47.360> a<00:03:47.450> very<00:03:48.320> popular<00:03:48.800> night<00:03:49.010> pad

00:03:49.210 --> 00:03:49.220 
performance in a very popular night pad

00:03:49.220 --> 00:03:51.550 
performance in a very popular night pad
parlance<00:03:49.640> on<00:03:49.790> the<00:03:49.850> market<00:03:50.240> we<00:03:50.840> actually<00:03:51.200> over

00:03:51.550 --> 00:03:51.560 
parlance on the market we actually over

00:03:51.560 --> 00:03:53.940 
parlance on the market we actually over
overview<00:03:52.220> that<00:03:52.400> tool<00:03:52.670> by<00:03:52.850> about<00:03:53.420> 30<00:03:53.720> percent

00:03:53.940 --> 00:03:53.950 
overview that tool by about 30 percent

00:03:53.950 --> 00:03:56.530 
overview that tool by about 30 percent
so<00:03:54.950> you<00:03:55.040> can<00:03:55.340> really<00:03:55.520> see<00:03:55.820> the<00:03:55.970> integration<00:03:56.480> of

00:03:56.530 --> 00:03:56.540 
so you can really see the integration of

00:03:56.540 --> 00:03:57.850 
so you can really see the integration of
fuel<00:03:56.840> technology<00:03:57.410> and<00:03:57.560> how<00:03:57.650> those

00:03:57.850 --> 00:03:57.860 
fuel technology and how those

00:03:57.860 --> 00:03:59.440 
fuel technology and how those
efficiencies<00:03:58.310> and<00:03:58.670> performances<00:03:59.270> have

00:03:59.440 --> 00:03:59.450 
efficiencies and performances have

00:03:59.450 --> 00:04:02.560 
efficiencies and performances have
really<00:03:59.690> ramped<00:04:00.530> up<00:04:00.620> stepped<00:04:01.010> up<00:04:01.190> to<00:04:01.480> step<00:04:02.480> to

00:04:02.560 --> 00:04:02.570 
really ramped up stepped up to step to

00:04:02.570 --> 00:04:06.070 
really ramped up stepped up to step to
subside<00:04:02.990> a<00:04:03.020> bit<00:04:03.200> in<00:04:03.440> that
