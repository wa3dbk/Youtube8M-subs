myself it's a pretty simple interface

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:48.170 
myself it's a pretty simple interface
and<00:00:46.500> there's<00:00:46.890> really<00:00:47.070> only<00:00:47.190> three<00:00:47.610> options<00:00:47.760> on

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:48.180 
and there's really only three options on

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:50.299 
and there's really only three options on
this<00:00:48.329> main<00:00:48.510> screen<00:00:48.690> first<00:00:49.530> go<00:00:49.890> ahead<00:00:50.010> and<00:00:50.100> turn

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:52.110 
the service on with this option right up

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:54.319 
the service on with this option right up
top<00:00:52.350> then<00:00:53.039> you<00:00:53.070> can<00:00:53.370> disable<00:00:53.640> the<00:00:53.879> ongoing

I<00:00:56.190> wouldn't<00:00:56.520> recommend<00:00:56.730> that<00:00:56.940> since<00:00:57.360> that's

00:00:57.470 --> 00:00:57.480 
I wouldn't recommend that since that's

00:00:57.480 --> 00:00:58.849 
I wouldn't recommend that since that's

the<00:01:01.140> third<00:01:01.320> option<00:01:01.710> will<00:01:01.829> automatically

00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:02.340 
the third option will automatically

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:03.799 
the third option will automatically
