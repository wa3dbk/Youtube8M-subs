00:00:40.360 --> 00:00:43.460
 thank you 

00:00:43.460 --> 00:00:47.840
 did not reach our level where children are a real winner among the players 

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:50.150
 just sample our best matches 

00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:54.150
 mac and that a compliment for now has absolutely managed to say so 

00:00:54.150 --> 00:00:57.510
 to disrupt the emergence of the set pins and 

00:00:58.240 --> 00:01:01.930
 and those people in particular were not in the competition and then you get one 

00:01:01.930 --> 00:01:03.170
 counter goal 

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:04.540
 and 

00:01:04.540 --> 00:01:08.190
 Then you also see that in that phase we have a few times left but still close 

00:01:08.190 --> 00:01:12.230
 weren't able to get soccer people and bin on their knees and and 

00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:14.220
 then it was still in the final phase 

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:18.580
 still beating 2 0 in the nest because I am saying goodbye 

00:01:18.580 --> 00:01:21.810
 otherwise suggested 

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:26.549
 yes and no yyy age hear the final in the week needed to pay 

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:29.970
 yes make a very nice pot 

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:32.600
 only in after twenty minutes 

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:35.980
 a bit later we possibly know we are not our soccer player 

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:40.040
 yes you don't try not to combine just kick a ball for it 

00:01:40.040 --> 00:01:42.080
 and the there benefits from it 

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:45.400
 No European football is reducing the chance that your body will go 

00:01:45.400 --> 00:01:48.500
 after that it's hard to say what 

00:01:48.500 --> 00:01:51.690
 Sure to fight for that for pricey but I still think it's one 

00:01:51.690 --> 00:01:55.340
 great club Groningen I always said there were four great 

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:56.970
 years of my life 

00:01:56.970 --> 00:02:01.910
 and there it goes now that came from yes you are then 60 ends 

00:02:01.910 --> 00:02:03.510
 we have nothing and 

00:02:03.510 --> 00:02:06.710
 there have also been other situations but it is a shame because 

00:02:06.710 --> 00:02:07.310
 the 

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:10.620
 yes I fully agree that both teams had to catch up with Europe 

00:02:11.569 --> 00:02:14.609
 you have to go into the water that moment must finish that happen 

00:02:15.639 --> 00:02:19.300
 he has had the seven-point jump in this competition for some time 

00:02:19.300 --> 00:02:23.120
 a serial killer could not win there after the first minute after that 

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:23.959
 really up 

00:02:23.959 --> 00:02:28.000
 we created far too little and I'm just saying the forces were gone too 

00:02:27.999 --> 00:02:30.529
 pressure did not appear to play football 

00:02:30.529 --> 00:02:33.119
 yes to take with a role like then 

00:02:33.119 --> 00:02:37.229
 for me something like that broke in is no longer happening that is already 

00:02:37.229 --> 00:02:38.719
 a little 

00:02:38.719 --> 00:02:39.630
 believe our work 

00:02:39.630 --> 00:02:40.580
 yes anyway
