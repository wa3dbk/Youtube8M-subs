a fence wire okay
and<00:00:24.500> these<00:00:25.500> about<00:00:25.740> 14<00:00:26.130> inches

00:00:26.599 --> 00:00:26.609 
and these about 14 inches

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:29.620 
and these about 14 inches
I<00:00:26.640> do<00:00:26.730> measure<00:00:27.060> them<00:00:27.740> measure<00:00:28.740> it<00:00:28.890> this<00:00:28.980> time

00:00:29.620 --> 00:00:29.630 
I do measure them measure it this time

latches<00:00:43.530> to<00:00:43.649> the<00:00:43.770> outside<00:00:44.219> of<00:00:44.250> the<00:00:44.399> door<00:00:46.280> it's

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:47.280 
latches to the outside of the door it's

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:51.619 
latches to the outside of the door it's
actually<00:00:47.610> easier<00:00:48.000> that<00:00:48.210> way<00:00:49.789> and<00:00:50.789> they<00:00:51.300> clamp

00:00:51.619 --> 00:00:51.629 
actually easier that way and they clamp

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:54.549 
actually easier that way and they clamp
down<00:00:51.719> just<00:00:52.110> like<00:00:52.230> that

00:00:54.549 --> 00:00:54.559 

00:00:54.559 --> 00:01:02.750 

okay<00:00:58.940> wires<00:01:00.050> the<00:01:01.050> wire<00:01:01.230> has<00:01:01.500> a<00:01:01.579> pretty<00:01:02.579> good

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:02.760 
okay wires the wire has a pretty good

okay wires the wire has a pretty good
tension<00:01:03.090> on<00:01:03.210> it<00:01:03.500> it<00:01:04.500> is<00:01:04.559> bendable<00:01:05.330> although

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:06.330 
tension on it it is bendable although

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:09.429 
tension on it it is bendable although
it's<00:01:06.479> difficult<00:01:07.520> it's<00:01:08.520> a<00:01:08.640> small<00:01:08.909> pair<00:01:09.180> of

00:01:09.429 --> 00:01:09.439 
it's difficult it's a small pair of

00:01:09.439 --> 00:01:16.100 
it's difficult it's a small pair of
pliers<00:01:11.000> stick<00:01:12.000> it<00:01:12.119> in<00:01:12.240> the<00:01:12.600> hole<00:01:12.810> and<00:01:14.930> make<00:01:15.930> my

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:16.110 
pliers stick it in the hole and make my

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:23.349 
pliers stick it in the hole and make my
first<00:01:16.320> Bend

00:01:23.349 --> 00:01:23.359 

00:01:23.359 --> 00:01:26.510 

make<00:01:24.359> a<00:01:24.390> second<00:01:24.810> mend<00:01:25.159> makes<00:01:26.159> a<00:01:26.250> little<00:01:26.340> hook

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:26.520 
make a second mend makes a little hook

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:32.300 
make a second mend makes a little hook
that's<00:01:27.030> the<00:01:27.329> initial<00:01:27.810> latch<00:01:28.170> I<00:01:31.070> do<00:01:32.070> it<00:01:32.250> in

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:32.310 
that's the initial latch I do it in

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:34.279 
that's the initial latch I do it in
steps<00:01:32.549> I<00:01:32.880> make<00:01:33.270> several<00:01:33.539> at<00:01:33.719> the<00:01:33.840> same<00:01:34.020> time

00:01:34.279 --> 00:01:34.289 
steps I make several at the same time

00:01:34.289 --> 00:01:37.370 
steps I make several at the same time
cut<00:01:34.530> all<00:01:34.619> my<00:01:34.770> wire<00:01:35.009> make<00:01:35.850> all<00:01:36.000> my<00:01:36.179> bends<00:01:36.840> do<00:01:37.229> all

00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:37.380 
cut all my wire make all my bends do all

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:39.350 
cut all my wire make all my bends do all
the<00:01:37.500> bends<00:01:37.770> all<00:01:37.890> at<00:01:38.009> the<00:01:38.100> same<00:01:38.280> time<00:01:38.340> so<00:01:39.270> I'm

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:39.360 
the bends all at the same time so I'm

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:41.830 
the bends all at the same time so I'm
doing<00:01:39.509> the<00:01:39.630> same<00:01:39.840> thing<00:01:40.020> over<00:01:40.200> and<00:01:40.409> over<00:01:40.500> again

00:01:41.830 --> 00:01:41.840 
doing the same thing over and over again

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:45.859 
doing the same thing over and over again
this<00:01:42.840> is<00:01:42.899> a<00:01:43.020> vise<00:01:44.240> piece<00:01:45.240> of<00:01:45.390> one-inch<00:01:45.569> steel

00:01:45.859 --> 00:01:45.869 
this is a vise piece of one-inch steel

00:01:45.869 --> 00:01:49.219 
this is a vise piece of one-inch steel
pipe<00:01:46.259> all<00:01:46.649> over<00:01:46.950> so<00:01:47.789> I<00:01:47.819> can<00:01:48.060> use<00:01:48.209> it<00:01:48.240> to<00:01:48.390> make<00:01:48.959> my

00:01:49.219 --> 00:01:49.229 
pipe all over so I can use it to make my

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:51.559 
pipe all over so I can use it to make my
make<00:01:49.890> my<00:01:50.069> bins<00:01:50.280> another<00:01:51.119> pair<00:01:51.329> of<00:01:51.420> vice<00:01:51.539> grips

00:01:51.559 --> 00:01:51.569 
make my bins another pair of vice grips

00:01:51.569 --> 00:01:56.300 
make my bins another pair of vice grips
I've<00:01:51.990> set<00:01:52.259> to<00:01:52.469> grab<00:01:52.679> the<00:01:52.890> wire<00:01:55.039> about<00:01:56.039> an<00:01:56.189> inch

00:01:56.300 --> 00:01:56.310 
I've set to grab the wire about an inch

00:01:56.310 --> 00:02:01.460 
I've set to grab the wire about an inch
in<00:01:57.319> flat<00:01:58.319> plane<00:01:58.649> this<00:01:59.459> way<00:02:00.079> and<00:02:01.079> I<00:02:01.170> bend<00:02:01.380> it

00:02:01.460 --> 00:02:01.470 
in flat plane this way and I bend it

00:02:01.470 --> 00:02:05.990 
in flat plane this way and I bend it
down<00:02:02.149> then<00:02:03.149> I<00:02:03.770> go<00:02:04.770> another<00:02:04.979> inch<00:02:05.069> in<00:02:05.429> and<00:02:05.640> I<00:02:05.759> put

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:06.000 
down then I go another inch in and I put

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:11.559 
down then I go another inch in and I put
it<00:02:06.090> underneath<00:02:06.770> keeping<00:02:07.770> that<00:02:07.890> same<00:02:08.160> plane

00:02:11.559 --> 00:02:11.569 

00:02:11.569 --> 00:02:15.620 

end<00:02:12.569> it<00:02:12.690> up<00:02:13.160> I'm<00:02:14.160> done<00:02:14.430> looks<00:02:15.180> like<00:02:15.360> a<00:02:15.390> little

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:15.630 
end it up I'm done looks like a little

00:02:15.630 --> 00:02:20.089 
end it up I'm done looks like a little
lightning<00:02:15.989> bolt<00:02:16.019> or<00:02:16.349> an<00:02:16.410> S<00:02:18.379> now<00:02:19.379> I've<00:02:19.620> got<00:02:19.829> the

00:02:20.089 --> 00:02:20.099 
lightning bolt or an S now I've got the

00:02:20.099 --> 00:02:24.080 
lightning bolt or an S now I've got the
hook<00:02:20.540> looking<00:02:21.540> straight<00:02:21.840> up<00:02:21.870> at<00:02:22.110> me<00:02:22.819> and<00:02:23.819> I<00:02:23.940> go

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:24.090 
hook looking straight up at me and I go

00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:28.099 
hook looking straight up at me and I go
about<00:02:24.269> another<00:02:24.450> inch<00:02:24.690> in<00:02:24.930> and<00:02:25.170> I<00:02:25.350> clamp<00:02:26.160> it<00:02:27.109> to

00:02:28.099 --> 00:02:28.109 
about another inch in and I clamp it to

00:02:28.109 --> 00:02:35.390 
about another inch in and I clamp it to
the<00:02:28.440> pipe<00:02:30.769> fold<00:02:31.769> it<00:02:31.980> around<00:02:32.569> turn<00:02:33.569> turn<00:02:34.400> two

00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:35.400 
the pipe fold it around turn turn two

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:39.229 
the pipe fold it around turn turn two
turns<00:02:35.700> in<00:02:35.850> about<00:02:36.230> 1/2<00:02:37.230> or<00:02:37.560> 1/4<00:02:37.880> so<00:02:38.880> that<00:02:39.120> when

00:02:39.229 --> 00:02:39.239 
turns in about 1/2 or 1/4 so that when

00:02:39.239 --> 00:02:41.900 
turns in about 1/2 or 1/4 so that when
you're<00:02:39.389> done<00:02:40.040> that<00:02:41.040> little<00:02:41.340> tail<00:02:41.519> sticks

00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:41.910 
you're done that little tail sticks

00:02:41.910 --> 00:02:47.000 
you're done that little tail sticks
straight<00:02:42.150> down<00:02:45.230> you<00:02:46.230> want<00:02:46.440> that<00:02:46.590> night<00:02:46.799> you

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:47.010 
straight down you want that night you

00:02:47.010 --> 00:02:48.500 
straight down you want that night you
want<00:02:47.190> that<00:02:47.310> tail<00:02:47.489> sticking<00:02:47.850> straight<00:02:48.060> down<00:02:48.299> so

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:48.510 
want that tail sticking straight down so

00:02:48.510 --> 00:02:55.980 
want that tail sticking straight down so
you<00:02:48.630> can<00:02:48.780> grab<00:02:48.959> it<00:02:49.109> here
