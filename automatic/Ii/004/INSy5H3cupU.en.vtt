melanie<00:02:01.380> decided<00:02:01.860> to<00:02:01.950> do<00:02:02.490> per<00:02:02.700> round

00:02:03.399 --> 00:02:03.409 
melanie decided to do per round

00:02:03.409 --> 00:02:05.959 
melanie decided to do per round
so<00:02:04.409> if<00:02:04.530> it<00:02:04.649> gets<00:02:04.799> dirty<00:02:05.130> you<00:02:05.310> want<00:02:05.610> to<00:02:05.670> see<00:02:05.820> it

00:02:05.959 --> 00:02:05.969 
so if it gets dirty you want to see it

00:02:05.969 --> 00:02:09.080 
so if it gets dirty you want to see it
on<00:02:06.119> the<00:02:06.659> inside<00:02:06.840> and<00:02:07.320> then<00:02:07.829> I<00:02:07.920> cut<00:02:08.190> interfacing

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:09.090 
on the inside and then I cut interfacing

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:10.669 
on the inside and then I cut interfacing
so<00:02:09.270> my<00:02:09.390> brand<00:02:09.690> will<00:02:09.840> be<00:02:09.959> stiff

00:02:10.669 --> 00:02:10.679 
so my brand will be stiff

00:02:10.679 --> 00:02:14.569

it's<00:02:10.799> like<00:02:10.950> this<00:02:11.189> one<00:02:12.530> so<00:02:13.530> now<00:02:13.860> the<00:02:13.920> next<00:02:14.430> thing

00:02:14.569 --> 00:02:14.579 
it's like this one so now the next thing

00:02:14.579 --> 00:02:16.550 
it's like this one so now the next thing
to<00:02:14.640> do<00:02:14.849> is<00:02:15.060> to<00:02:15.299> sew<00:02:15.750> all<00:02:16.019> these<00:02:16.260> things
