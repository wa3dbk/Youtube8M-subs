00:00:11.330 --> 00:00:15.330
 hello to all these worries or how 

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:16.890
 go listen to me, I'm fine 

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:18.720
 friends we meet today for a 

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:20.939
 new video sent to us by 

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:23.160
 was nixon for a little lucky glee on 

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:24.750
 call of duty advance wars you 

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:26.789
 simply to achieve 

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:28.890
 again the roofs of the caf to 7 after the 

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:30.539
 last patch really of the best 

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:32.759
 way why simply because 

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:33.719
 this way it really is in my opinion 

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:35.730
 simpler and you will understand 

00:00:33.719 --> 00:00:37.320
 why at first you 

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:39.300
 will you even go to where you are 

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:40.860
 say above are used exoplanet 

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:43.110
 where you hover a little bit to 

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:45.059
 right and right after using the drone 

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:46.050
 pointed exactly the same this 

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:48.149
 they pay, that is to say wholesale 

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:49.410
 progressively on the 

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:50.070
 little barriers we will call that as 

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:51.989
 this and now 

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:53.940
 once you are at the top 

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:55.590
 and well you'll see just too 

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:57.270
 quickly that it can be that you 

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:59.820
 will already be on the roofs of the map 

00:00:57.270 --> 00:01:01.469
 enough so here I just hope that 

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:03.420
 the video my troupe up will be more 

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:04.799

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:06.420

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:07.770

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:10.140
