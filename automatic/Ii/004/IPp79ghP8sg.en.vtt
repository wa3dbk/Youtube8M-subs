00:00:22.039 --> 00:00:26.880
 Hi everyone! How are you? 6. 

00:00:25.259 --> 00:00:30.570
 Today's video I'm going to give a 

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:34.370
 homemade recipe for you and moisturize 

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:37.410
 your nails and also strengthen with 

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:39.780
 only ingredients you have at home and 

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:42.539
 that is super easy 

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:45.720
 so if you want to know how to strengthen 

00:00:42.539 --> 00:00:46.760
 hydrate your lines continue 

00:00:45.720 --> 00:00:50.300
 watching 

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:54.420
 So I'll go to my bathroom because 

00:00:50.300 --> 00:00:57.290
 as it is with garlic oil has already'll 

00:00:54.420 --> 00:01:01.200
 That's good for you, Olive Oil. 

00:00:57.290 --> 00:01:04.769
 this hydration and consequently already 

00:01:01.200 --> 00:01:07.380
 I then strengthened my nails so as not to 

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:09.990
 Melek here then I 'll go there to the bathroom. 

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:11.930
 so come with me 

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:15.020
 The people are already here in my bathroom. 

00:01:11.930 --> 00:01:18.330
 if you happen to be listening 

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:21.479
 The noise you had and the background is 

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:25.020
 because it does not have as such and has 

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:29.850
 area already on it if you are 

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:36.780
 listening, but excuse me but then 

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:39.600
 If you need olive oil, this is for olive oil. 

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:43.409
 extra-virgin but it can be 

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:46.740
 use whatever oil you have in 

00:01:43.409 --> 00:01:48.270
 home and everyone already knows that the 

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:52.590
 olive oil has several properties 

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:54.780
 moisturizers and fortifiers that is great 

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:59.159
 also to use a hair to 

00:01:54.780 --> 00:02:03.810
 moisturize do meditation then the nails 

00:01:59.159 --> 00:02:04.950
 also benefit from the properties 

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:07.229
 of olive oil 

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:10.289
 both the nails also count the cuticles 

00:02:07.229 --> 00:02:14.760
 is much more hydrated than with 

00:02:10.289 --> 00:02:17.610
 cream then you 're going to use a little pot 

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:21.120
 What do you have at home? 

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:22.380
 people that you can put your finger on 

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:26.160
 in there 

00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:29.040
 then you will cover not enough 

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:32.600
 to cover the tips of the fingers 

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:32.600
 so I 'll put it here 

00:02:39.270 --> 00:02:45.250
 good did ours wrong and with that 

00:02:42.880 --> 00:02:47.970
 that I came to the old bathroom was already 

00:02:45.250 --> 00:02:47.970
 expected 

00:02:49.090 --> 00:02:54.190
 you can feel if the market is a bit 

00:02:52.060 --> 00:02:59.440
 a feeling of mine 

00:02:54.190 --> 00:03:03.730
 So this is but for the reason then you 

00:02:59.440 --> 00:03:08.350
 will put your hand inside the 

00:03:03.730 --> 00:03:12.550
 container will leave submerged about 20 

00:03:08.350 --> 00:03:15.880
 minutes every day then every 

00:03:12.550 --> 00:03:21.540
 days and will leave 20 minutes in here. 

00:03:15.880 --> 00:03:25.660
 and moisturizing your nails to your gluttony and 

00:03:21.540 --> 00:03:30.000
 You do this every day until you 

00:03:25.660 --> 00:03:34.360
 feel an improvement when you are already well 

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:37.150
 treated and you realize the difference 

00:03:34.360 --> 00:03:40.930
 There you go and you can do 

00:03:37.150 --> 00:03:43.470
 from 15 to 15 and then once a month 

00:03:40.930 --> 00:03:51.340
 depending on the need you are 

00:03:43.470 --> 00:03:56.500
 so there you leave moisturizing 20 minutes 

00:03:51.340 --> 00:04:00.300
 with one another if they wish until after 

00:03:56.500 --> 00:04:03.750
 already doing the nails is not who is going to stay 

00:04:00.300 --> 00:04:06.880
 pretty good is to push the cuticle 

00:04:03.750 --> 00:04:08.769
 because I did not have the tico until I already made a 

00:04:06.880 --> 00:04:11.920
 video here on the channel showing how I 

00:04:08.769 --> 00:04:15.489
 I do and I just push and take off the excess 

00:04:11.920 --> 00:04:17.709
 Yes, and then I paint. 

00:04:15.489 --> 00:04:21.519
 Then with this hydration, it will look beautiful. 

00:04:17.709 --> 00:04:24.070
 Nee and I have already done this week and I 

00:04:21.519 --> 00:04:25.060
 I noticed a lot of difference in my 

00:04:24.070 --> 00:04:27.370
