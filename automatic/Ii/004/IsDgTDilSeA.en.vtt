has just ended finals were between
complexity<00:00:08.790> and<00:00:09.179> TK<00:00:10.010> it<00:00:11.010> was<00:00:11.130> a<00:00:11.160> damn<00:00:11.370> good

00:00:11.419 --> 00:00:11.429 
complexity and TK it was a damn good

00:00:11.429 --> 00:00:13.310 
complexity and TK it was a damn good
tournament<00:00:12.120> went<00:00:12.480> all<00:00:12.599> the<00:00:12.719> way<00:00:12.750> to<00:00:12.870> the<00:00:12.990> final

00:00:15.470 --> 00:00:15.480 
match it seemed like every single match

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:19.609 
match it seemed like every single match
was<00:00:15.719> clutch<00:00:15.990> and<00:00:16.320> the<00:00:17.390> the<00:00:18.390> six<00:00:18.900> match<00:00:19.140> where

Nez low got a blitz cap with literally 0
seconds<00:00:27.420> left<00:00:27.630> and<00:00:27.779> they<00:00:28.199> won<00:00:28.439> the<00:00:28.590> game<00:00:28.769> 11<00:00:29.429> to

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:49.260 
ecology ghosts and complexity wins what

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:51.290 
ecology ghosts and complexity wins what
is<00:00:49.350> that<00:00:49.469> is<00:00:49.680> that<00:00:49.770> six<00:00:50.340> major<00:00:50.640> events<00:00:51.120> down<00:00:51.270> a

00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:51.300 
is that is that six major events down a

00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:53.280 
row I I'm not a hundred percent it's

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:55.340 
row I I'm not a hundred percent it's
either<00:00:53.370> six<00:00:53.670> or<00:00:53.789> seven<00:00:54.090> but<00:00:54.329> if<00:00:54.870> I'm<00:00:55.170> wrong

00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:55.350 
either six or seven but if I'm wrong

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:56.990 
either six or seven but if I'm wrong
somebody<00:00:55.980> will<00:00:56.070> correct<00:00:56.399> me<00:00:56.520> anyway<00:00:56.850> in<00:00:56.940> the

00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:03.750 
they're just kind of the brackets

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:06.020

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:09.210 
brackets from today leading up and into

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:13.100 
brackets from today leading up and into
the<00:01:09.330> grand<00:01:09.570> finals<00:01:09.990> and<00:01:11.180> there<00:01:12.180> was<00:01:12.360> also<00:01:12.540> this

right here this just shows the teams

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:18.770 
right here this just shows the teams
that<00:01:16.439> complexity<00:01:17.250> and<00:01:17.549> caliber<00:01:17.970> defeated<00:01:18.450> on

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:18.780 
that complexity and caliber defeated on

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:21.340 
that complexity and caliber defeated on
their<00:01:19.530> way<00:01:19.680> to<00:01:19.710> the<00:01:19.950> championship<00:01:20.130> match<00:01:20.759> I

00:01:21.340 --> 00:01:21.350 
their way to the championship match I

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:25.190 
their way to the championship match I
gotta<00:01:22.350> admit<00:01:22.500> I<00:01:22.890> I<00:01:23.220> was<00:01:23.670> kind<00:01:24.659> of<00:01:24.750> skeptical

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:25.200 
gotta admit I I was kind of skeptical

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:27.320 
gotta admit I I was kind of skeptical
like<00:01:25.680> I<00:01:25.770> said<00:01:25.979> in<00:01:26.220> a<00:01:26.369> previous<00:01:26.759> video<00:01:27.119> about

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:27.330 
like I said in a previous video about

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:29.120 
like I said in a previous video about
how<00:01:27.960> entertaining<00:01:28.439> this<00:01:28.799> would<00:01:28.979> be

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:29.130 
how entertaining this would be

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:32.960 
how entertaining this would be
especially<00:01:29.970> blitz<00:01:31.130> but<00:01:32.130> blitz<00:01:32.400> is<00:01:32.549> actually

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:32.970 
especially blitz but blitz is actually

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:34.490 
especially blitz but blitz is actually
really<00:01:33.210> fun<00:01:33.479> to<00:01:33.600> watch<00:01:33.689> I<00:01:33.930> think<00:01:34.140> I<00:01:34.259> actually

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:34.500 
really fun to watch I think I actually

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:38.300 
really fun to watch I think I actually
enjoy<00:01:35.100> it<00:01:35.310> more<00:01:35.549> than<00:01:35.610> I<00:01:35.850> enjoy<00:01:36.240> CTF<00:01:36.860> which<00:01:37.860> I

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:38.310 
enjoy it more than I enjoy CTF which I

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:41.630 
enjoy it more than I enjoy CTF which I
really<00:01:39.000> wasn't<00:01:39.600> expecting<00:01:39.780> you<00:01:40.290> know<00:01:40.500> I<00:01:40.740> mean

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:41.640 
really wasn't expecting you know I mean

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:43.789 
really wasn't expecting you know I mean
domination<00:01:42.240> domination<00:01:43.049> just<00:01:43.229> sucks<00:01:43.590> to

00:01:43.789 --> 00:01:43.799 
domination domination just sucks to

00:01:43.799 --> 00:01:46.550 
domination domination just sucks to
watch<00:01:44.009> but<00:01:44.840> thoroughly<00:01:45.840> search<00:01:46.259> and<00:01:46.439> destroy

00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:46.560 
watch but thoroughly search and destroy

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:48.740 
watch but thoroughly search and destroy
blitz<00:01:47.040> have<00:01:47.189> something<00:01:47.520> going<00:01:47.670> for<00:01:47.790> him<00:01:48.000> and

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:48.750 
blitz have something going for him and

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:51.740 
blitz have something going for him and
yeah<00:01:49.110> I<00:01:49.350> mean<00:01:49.979> hoping<00:01:50.460> I'm<00:01:51.119> hoping<00:01:51.180> in<00:01:51.659> the

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:51.750 
yeah I mean hoping I'm hoping in the

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:54.050 
yeah I mean hoping I'm hoping in the
future<00:01:51.869> they<00:01:52.170> can<00:01:52.320> somehow<00:01:52.970> implement<00:01:53.970> and

00:01:54.050 --> 00:01:54.060 
future they can somehow implement and

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:55.969 
future they can somehow implement and
hard<00:01:54.240> point<00:01:54.450> in<00:01:54.570> this<00:01:54.689> game<00:01:54.750> it'd<00:01:55.560> be<00:01:55.740> kind<00:01:55.920> of

00:01:55.969 --> 00:01:55.979 
hard point in this game it'd be kind of

00:01:55.979 --> 00:01:57.050 
hard point in this game it'd be kind of
hard<00:01:56.189> with<00:01:56.399> some<00:01:56.579> of<00:01:56.670> these<00:01:56.729> maps<00:01:57.000> because

00:01:57.050 --> 00:01:57.060 
hard with some of these maps because

00:01:57.060 --> 00:01:59.300 
hard with some of these maps because
they're<00:01:57.240> so<00:01:57.390> big<00:01:57.600> I'm<00:01:58.200> hoping<00:01:58.409> with<00:01:58.649> some<00:01:58.799> DLC

00:01:59.300 --> 00:01:59.310 
they're so big I'm hoping with some DLC

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:00.830 
they're so big I'm hoping with some DLC
maybe<00:01:59.579> it'll<00:01:59.759> make<00:01:59.880> some<00:02:00.060> three-lane<00:02:00.509> maps

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:00.840 
maybe it'll make some three-lane maps

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:02.810 
maybe it'll make some three-lane maps
bring<00:02:01.350> back<00:02:01.530> hard<00:02:01.799> point<00:02:02.040> and<00:02:02.219> use<00:02:02.430> them<00:02:02.610> you

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:02.820 
bring back hard point and use them you

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:05.240 
bring back hard point and use them you
know<00:02:02.969> specifically<00:02:03.570> for<00:02:03.990> these<00:02:04.920> tournaments

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:05.250 
know specifically for these tournaments

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:07.670 
know specifically for these tournaments
because<00:02:05.659> this<00:02:06.659> could<00:02:06.810> actually<00:02:06.990> be<00:02:07.290> pretty

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:07.680 
because this could actually be pretty

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:10.520 
because this could actually be pretty

00:02:29.210 --> 00:02:29.220 
complexity I mean they're not just

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:32.570 
complexity I mean they're not just
dominating<00:02:30.060> you<00:02:30.720> know<00:02:30.870> black<00:02:31.620> ops<00:02:31.860> 2<00:02:32.100> and<00:02:32.430> now

00:02:32.570 --> 00:02:32.580
