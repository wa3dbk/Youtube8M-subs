00:00:04.090 --> 00:00:10.360
 for more than 135 million years have 

00:00:08.260 --> 00:00:13.720
 been the true rulers of the 

00:00:10.360 --> 00:00:16.730
 planet since the beginning of the Jurassic and 

00:00:13.720 --> 00:00:19.189
 until the end of the Cretaceous 

00:00:16.730 --> 00:00:20.529
 although the truth is that most of 

00:00:19.189 --> 00:00:22.640
 the species became extinct 

00:00:20.529 --> 00:00:25.189
 probably by the collision of a 

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:27.829
 meteorite the truth is that even today 

00:00:25.189 --> 00:00:29.869
 species circulate among us 

00:00:27.829 --> 00:00:32.710
 directly descendants of these 

00:00:29.869 --> 00:00:32.710
 prehistoric reptiles 

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:44.190
 the movie jurassic park directed by 

00:00:40.380 --> 00:00:47.160
 steven spielberg in 1992 and based on the 

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:49.620
 michael crichton's novel posed the 

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:52.110
 possibility that from the DNA of 

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:55.199
 a fossil could consider cloning 

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:58.410
 and the consequent concern of the 

00:00:55.199 --> 00:01:01.470
 land by these creatures 

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:03.300
 the huge success of the film and the high 

00:01:01.470 --> 00:01:06.060
 verisimilitude with which the story 

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:08.100
 is raised made many people 

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:09.750
 they will ask themselves if it would truly be 

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:13.110
 possible to find again the 

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:15.330
 dinosaurs on earth or even if 

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:18.770
 this type of experiments have been 

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:18.770
 carry out secretly 

00:01:21.610 --> 00:01:26.920
 but the truth is that with technology 

00:01:24.040 --> 00:01:29.380
 Today , however, it is almost 

00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:31.210
 impossible to resurrect dinosaurs from this 

00:01:29.380 --> 00:01:33.490
 way 

00:01:31.210 --> 00:01:36.460
 a problem with the extraction method 

00:01:33.490 --> 00:01:38.830
 in amber is that DNA is degraded with the 

00:01:36.460 --> 00:01:41.350
 time for exposure to air water 

00:01:38.830 --> 00:01:43.960
 and the natural radiation doing 

00:01:41.350 --> 00:01:45.880
 unlikely that such an operation will recover 

00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:48.909
 a sufficient amount of material 

00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:51.300
 useful genetic because of the corruption of 

00:01:48.909 --> 00:01:51.300
 adn 

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:58.759
 a photo has also had relevance 

00:01:56.930 --> 00:02:01.220
 recently hung on the networks 

00:01:58.759 --> 00:02:03.439
 social networks in which the 

00:02:01.220 --> 00:02:06.300
 own Steven spielberg posing next to 

00:02:03.439 --> 00:02:08.700
 a supposed dead dinosaur 

00:02:06.300 --> 00:02:10.560
 even though it was a picture of 

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:12.510
 spielberg on the set of 'jurassic 

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:15.270
 park ' and despite the obviousness of the 

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:17.780
 situation a significant number of 

00:02:15.270 --> 00:02:20.070
 Internet users took the photo for good 

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:22.140
 forgetting that that kind of kind of 

00:02:20.070 --> 00:02:24.860
 dinosaur took millions of years 

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:24.860
 extinct 

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:33.750
 but in spite of everything yes they exist to 

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:37.140
 today certain real dinosaurs 

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:40.380
 who live among us is no more 

00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:43.590
 nor less than the birds was thomas 

00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:46.380
 Henry Huxley known as the bulldog of 

00:02:43.590 --> 00:02:49.350
 Darwin who proposed for the first time 

00:02:46.380 --> 00:02:51.630
 scientifically convincing way that 

00:02:49.350 --> 00:02:55.709
 the birds had evolved from 

00:02:51.630 --> 00:02:59.640
 of some kind of ashley dinosaur in his 

00:02:55.709 --> 00:03:02.880
 1870 report defended that the birds 

00:02:59.640 --> 00:03:06.080
 as a group they evolved from the 

00:03:02.880 --> 00:03:06.080
 small theropods 

00:03:07.890 --> 00:03:13.410
 so that you already know your domain 

00:03:11.190 --> 00:03:16.500
 corresponds to a time that goes back to 

00:03:13.410 --> 00:03:19.650
 millions of years ago but its 

00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:22.310
 legacy never came to die at all and in 

00:03:19.650 --> 00:03:25.290
 certain way is still alive today 

00:03:22.310 --> 00:03:27.570
 every time you see a brave rooster 

00:03:25.290 --> 00:03:30.510
 of corral you can check that in your 

00:03:27.570 --> 00:03:34.160
 genetic code is the essence of the most 

00:03:30.510 --> 00:03:34.160
 fierce and wild kisses
