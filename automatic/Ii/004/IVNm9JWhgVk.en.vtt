00:00:32.510 --> 00:00:32.520 
interesting in description they talk

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:34.220 
interesting in description they talk
about<00:00:32.669> twisted<00:00:33.390> and<00:00:33.570> that's<00:00:33.719> what<00:00:33.899> it's<00:00:34.020> going

00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:34.230 
about twisted and that's what it's going

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:36.440 
about twisted and that's what it's going
to<00:00:34.380> be<00:00:34.530> and<00:00:35.160> that<00:00:35.190> means<00:00:35.550> two<00:00:35.760> things<00:00:36.090> it<00:00:36.329> means

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:36.450 
to be and that means two things it means

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:38.479 
to be and that means two things it means
beauty<00:00:36.870> but<00:00:37.020> it<00:00:37.110> also<00:00:37.260> means<00:00:37.530> very<00:00:37.950> expensive

00:00:38.479 --> 00:00:38.489 
beauty but it also means very expensive

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:41.090 
beauty but it also means very expensive
because<00:00:39.180> it<00:00:39.719> is<00:00:39.780> a<00:00:39.930> very<00:00:40.320> expensive<00:00:40.710> building
