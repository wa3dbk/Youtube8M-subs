transmissions beginning to slip a
strategy<00:01:01.880> is<00:01:02.060> to<00:01:02.300> to<00:01:02.900> raise<00:01:03.260> line<00:01:03.770> pressure<00:01:04.130> to

00:01:04.810 --> 00:01:04.820 
strategy is to to raise line pressure to

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:07.510 
strategy is to to raise line pressure to
overcome<00:01:05.420> that<00:01:05.690> slip<00:01:06.140> or<00:01:06.350> to<00:01:06.710> tighten<00:01:07.160> up<00:01:07.280> on

overcome that slip or to tighten up on
the<00:01:07.760> shift<00:01:08.000> to<00:01:08.150> depth

00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:08.570 
the shift to depth

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:11.350 
the shift to depth
sometimes<00:01:09.320> that<00:01:09.590> begins<00:01:10.010> to<00:01:10.220> cause<00:01:10.460> bumpy

00:01:11.350 --> 00:01:11.360 
sometimes that begins to cause bumpy

00:01:11.360 --> 00:01:13.990 
sometimes that begins to cause bumpy

you<00:01:26.270> can<00:01:26.450> notice<00:01:26.810> those<00:01:26.990> things<00:01:27.320> with<00:01:27.530> a<00:01:27.560> gauge

00:01:27.880 --> 00:01:27.890 
you can notice those things with a gauge

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:33.250 
you can notice those things with a gauge
and<00:01:28.300> even<00:01:29.300> when<00:01:29.450> you're<00:01:29.600> driving<00:01:29.960> now<00:01:30.550> if<00:01:32.260> in

00:01:33.250 --> 00:01:33.260 
and even when you're driving now if in

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:36.760 
and even when you're driving now if in
this<00:01:33.320> particular<00:01:33.740> case<00:01:34.369> with<00:01:34.670> the<00:01:34.850> o<00:01:34.910> 9g<00:01:35.560> we<00:01:36.560> do

00:01:36.760 --> 00:01:36.770 
this particular case with the o 9g we do

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:39.370 
this particular case with the o 9g we do
not<00:01:36.950> have<00:01:37.340> a<00:01:37.369> line<00:01:37.820> pressure<00:01:38.180> tap<00:01:38.570> all<00:01:38.840> we<00:01:39.200> have

00:01:39.370 --> 00:01:39.380 
not have a line pressure tap all we have

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:42.490 
not have a line pressure tap all we have
are<00:01:39.650> clutch<00:01:40.070> pressure<00:01:40.460> taps<00:01:40.910> so<00:01:41.350> when<00:01:42.350> you're

00:01:42.490 --> 00:01:42.500 
are clutch pressure taps so when you're

00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:44.469 
are clutch pressure taps so when you're
actually<00:01:42.649> hooking<00:01:43.280> up<00:01:43.429> a<00:01:43.580> gauge<00:01:43.820> to<00:01:44.119> say<00:01:44.300> the

00:01:44.469 --> 00:01:44.479 
actually hooking up a gauge to say the

00:01:44.479 --> 00:01:47.859 
actually hooking up a gauge to say the
k1<00:01:45.020> clutch<00:01:45.500> all<00:01:46.220> you're<00:01:46.759> looking<00:01:46.940> at<00:01:47.270> is<00:01:47.600> the

00:01:47.859 --> 00:01:47.869 
k1 clutch all you're looking at is the

00:01:47.869 --> 00:01:50.529 
k1 clutch all you're looking at is the
k1<00:01:48.440> clutch<00:01:48.800> pressure<00:01:49.160> which<00:01:49.550> when<00:01:50.000> engaged

00:01:50.529 --> 00:01:50.539 
k1 clutch pressure which when engaged

00:01:50.539 --> 00:01:53.590 
k1 clutch pressure which when engaged
should<00:01:51.229> be<00:01:51.500> line<00:01:51.770> pressure<00:01:52.100> now<00:01:52.970> how<00:01:53.300> do<00:01:53.360> you

00:01:53.590 --> 00:01:53.600 
should be line pressure now how do you

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:58.359 
should be line pressure now how do you
know<00:01:53.750> if<00:01:55.240> if<00:01:56.240> that<00:01:56.600> line<00:01:56.899> pressure<00:01:57.229> is<00:01:57.530> low<00:01:58.009> is

00:01:58.359 --> 00:01:58.369 
know if if that line pressure is low is

00:01:58.369 --> 00:02:01.660 
know if if that line pressure is low is
it<00:01:59.210> because<00:01:59.660> or<00:02:00.410> should<00:02:00.679> I<00:02:00.770> say<00:02:00.950> if<00:02:01.100> the<00:02:01.250> k1

00:02:01.660 --> 00:02:01.670 
it because or should I say if the k1

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:03.400 
it because or should I say if the k1
clutch<00:02:02.000> pressure<00:02:02.330> is<00:02:02.570> low<00:02:02.869> and<00:02:03.140> does<00:02:03.289> that

00:02:03.400 --> 00:02:03.410 
clutch pressure is low and does that

00:02:03.410 --> 00:02:05.650 
clutch pressure is low and does that
mean<00:02:03.619> that<00:02:03.800> line<00:02:04.070> pressure<00:02:04.429> is<00:02:04.610> low<00:02:04.820> or<00:02:05.149> does

00:02:05.650 --> 00:02:05.660 
mean that line pressure is low or does

00:02:05.660 --> 00:02:07.600 
mean that line pressure is low or does
that<00:02:05.690> mean<00:02:05.869> we<00:02:06.140> have<00:02:06.170> a<00:02:06.319> leak<00:02:06.649> in<00:02:06.890> the<00:02:07.190> k1

00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:07.610 
that mean we have a leak in the k1

00:02:07.610 --> 00:02:09.430 
that mean we have a leak in the k1
clutch<00:02:07.940> well<00:02:08.509> the<00:02:08.630> only<00:02:08.780> way<00:02:08.990> that<00:02:09.170> you<00:02:09.259> can

00:02:09.430 --> 00:02:09.440 
clutch well the only way that you can

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:11.380 
clutch well the only way that you can
really<00:02:09.710> make<00:02:10.009> that<00:02:10.220> determination<00:02:10.460> is<00:02:11.270> you

00:02:11.380 --> 00:02:11.390 
really make that determination is you

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:13.720 
really make that determination is you
would<00:02:11.540> need<00:02:11.720> to<00:02:11.900> have<00:02:11.930> a<00:02:12.380> gauge<00:02:12.920> let's<00:02:13.310> say<00:02:13.520> on

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:13.730 
would need to have a gauge let's say on

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:16.780 
would need to have a gauge let's say on
the<00:02:13.790> k2<00:02:14.510> clutch<00:02:15.110> as<00:02:15.490> well

00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:16.790 
the k2 clutch as well

00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:19.510 
the k2 clutch as well
now<00:02:17.180> when<00:02:17.480> the<00:02:17.600> k1<00:02:18.110> and<00:02:18.290> the<00:02:18.319> k2<00:02:18.620> clutches<00:02:19.370> are

00:02:19.510 --> 00:02:19.520 
now when the k1 and the k2 clutches are

00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:23.680 
now when the k1 and the k2 clutches are
both<00:02:19.790> applied<00:02:20.210> if<00:02:20.600> they're<00:02:21.410> both<00:02:21.860> low<00:02:22.690> chances

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:23.690 
both applied if they're both low chances

00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:27.640 
both applied if they're both low chances
are<00:02:23.900> line<00:02:24.680> pressures<00:02:25.220> low<00:02:25.569> however<00:02:26.569> if<00:02:26.870> the<00:02:27.110> k1

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:27.650 
are line pressures low however if the k1

00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:30.370 
are line pressures low however if the k1
is<00:02:27.800> low<00:02:27.980> and<00:02:28.280> the<00:02:28.370> k2<00:02:28.640> is<00:02:29.030> high<00:02:29.240> now<00:02:29.990> you<00:02:30.050> know

00:02:30.370 --> 00:02:30.380 
is low and the k2 is high now you know

00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:32.530 
is low and the k2 is high now you know
that<00:02:30.530> you've<00:02:30.680> got<00:02:30.920> a<00:02:30.950> leak<00:02:31.640> in<00:02:31.819> the<00:02:32.060> k1

00:02:32.530 --> 00:02:32.540 
that you've got a leak in the k1

00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:34.840 
that you've got a leak in the k1
clutched<00:02:32.959> circuit<00:02:33.440> so<00:02:33.590> you<00:02:34.010> can<00:02:34.220> begin<00:02:34.400> to

00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:34.850 
clutched circuit so you can begin to

00:02:34.850 --> 00:02:37.840 
clutched circuit so you can begin to
identify<00:02:35.720> where<00:02:36.650> your<00:02:36.800> performance<00:02:37.490> problems

00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:37.850 
identify where your performance problems

00:02:37.850 --> 00:02:39.820 
identify where your performance problems
might<00:02:38.090> be<00:02:38.120> it<00:02:38.720> might<00:02:38.959> be<00:02:39.140> because<00:02:39.350> you've<00:02:39.650> got

00:02:39.820 --> 00:02:39.830 
might be it might be because you've got

00:02:39.830 --> 00:02:41.740 
might be it might be because you've got
a<00:02:39.860> leak<00:02:40.130> in<00:02:40.250> the<00:02:40.400> K<00:02:40.580> one<00:02:40.850> clutch<00:02:41.180> circuit

00:02:41.740 --> 00:02:41.750 
a leak in the K one clutch circuit

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:44.290 
a leak in the K one clutch circuit
everything<00:02:42.290> related<00:02:42.800> to<00:02:42.920> the<00:02:43.069> k1<00:02:43.520> clutch<00:02:43.819> so

00:02:44.290 --> 00:02:44.300 
everything related to the k1 clutch so

00:02:44.300 --> 00:02:46.600 
everything related to the k1 clutch so
using<00:02:44.750> a<00:02:44.840> pressure<00:02:45.080> gauge<00:02:45.410> will<00:02:46.010> help<00:02:46.280> to

00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:46.610 
using a pressure gauge will help to
