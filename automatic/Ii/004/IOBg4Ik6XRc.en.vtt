00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.689
 crazy from the peak and the head more 

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:33.059
 of what I am more than what this 

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:35.040
 Computer action not not go to 

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:38.940
 credit against justice guaranteed wins 

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:41.820
 and it looks like a guiri plays gt5 

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:43.710
 has managed to see it well is the creator 

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:45.780
 of jeta 5 you know that the creator order 

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:47.480
 because your beak goes through the door and I 

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:50.329
 I was looking and now I tell you more 

00:00:47.480 --> 00:00:52.860
 ever of bimonthly then wadowice 

00:00:50.329 --> 00:00:55.500
 extinguish and has gotten the creator 

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:58.190
 in the aircraft section leave the 

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:58.190
 word and dra 

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:11.270
 in the description of information 

00:01:05.120 --> 00:01:13.250
 you know this person has got 

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:14.600
 this hacker has managed to get him out 

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:16.970
 well that's the word 

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:18.410
 idrac we know that it was seen that this one that 

00:01:16.970 --> 00:01:20.240
 there was a lot of talk about what was going on 

00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:23.240
 to put in gt5 that in the end as I said 

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:24.800
 climbed earlier as he to 1.16 removed 

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:26.060
 the file of pounds was taken from the 

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:27.590
 game therefore already people thought 

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:30.590
 that they were not going to put in but now in 

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:34.000
 1.17 what is doing flow is that I'm 

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:34.000
 watching telling me it was news he said 

00:01:34.990 --> 00:01:38.930
 so then now then point you made 

00:01:37.040 --> 00:01:40.160
 have added again what I know of the 

00:01:38.930 --> 00:01:41.840
 hidden files of lyrics that is already a 

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:42.860
 video talking about it that interests you 

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:44.570
 he has described him because he is quite 

00:01:42.860 --> 00:01:46.520
 interesting as a product 

00:01:44.570 --> 00:01:48.410
 copyright hours that gave this already something a 

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:50.390
 very strong reason that he was leading 

00:01:48.410 --> 00:01:51.770
 finish fine tone jeta 5 is not 

00:01:50.390 --> 00:01:52.820
 very clear that they are going to put it but I 

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:54.620
 very clear and I have a desire 

00:01:52.820 --> 00:01:55.790
 I just hope he shoots 

00:01:54.620 --> 00:01:58.130
 be like slideshare that is not like the 

00:01:55.790 --> 00:02:00.050
 it's true that I did to him that he was very 

00:01:58.130 --> 00:02:02.240
 handsome is if above you could not buy and 

00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:03.680
 Take it as you want, how cool of 

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:05.360
 slater is that he can shoot and then the 

00:02:03.680 --> 00:02:07.220
 see it is that you can buy it then 

00:02:05.360 --> 00:02:08.479
 I'm going to be a perfect set that 

00:02:07.220 --> 00:02:09.860
 out in plan 

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:12.260
 the idea that can be bought once 

00:02:09.860 --> 00:02:14.150
 I could also shoot would be a flat 

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:16.069
 but he would be very handsome 

00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:18.260
 Well basically that was the truth 

00:02:16.069 --> 00:02:20.420
 which, as I say, is a very coherent reason 

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:21.950
 and very strong and very strong that 

00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:23.629
 another one surely puts it in the 

00:02:21.950 --> 00:02:26.030
 customization in next authorization 

00:02:23.629 --> 00:02:27.650
 of a little bit that expected slight 

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:30.340
 moment I do not know sir adhere the world 

00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:36.379
 does not have the same two ladies 

00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:39.739
 placed I can be liked by not 

00:02:36.379 --> 00:02:44.629
 have one for the case that really is 

00:02:39.739 --> 00:02:47.359
 something is happening the same to me 

00:02:44.629 --> 00:02:48.829
 case putting as if in the creator 

00:02:47.359 --> 00:02:49.579
 someone has managed to activate the word 

00:02:48.829 --> 00:02:51.049
 hydra 

00:02:49.579 --> 00:02:54.519
 they are no longer simply game files 

00:02:51.049 --> 00:02:54.519
 but you have to activate it 

00:02:56.930 --> 00:03:02.090
 The plane itself is not seen as a point 

00:02:59.690 --> 00:03:03.980
 but the plane itself does not see what 

00:03:02.090 --> 00:03:05.780
 happens if it's there because it's something 

00:03:03.980 --> 00:03:09.170
 it's going to be very clear what 

00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:10.519
 I do not know is when I think that as 

00:03:09.170 --> 00:03:11.780
 I 'm better but I think it's better 

00:03:10.519 --> 00:03:13.160
 for new generations or not 

00:03:11.780 --> 00:03:14.100
 only for her but for when 

00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:17.850
 make an update 

00:03:14.100 --> 00:03:21.420
 this generation is aware that in two 

00:03:17.850 --> 00:03:23.510
 months or so is the day of a month and peak 

00:03:21.420 --> 00:03:25.530
 it's veterans day of the 

00:03:23.510 --> 00:03:27.990
 radiation but from the military of 

00:03:25.530 --> 00:03:30.210
 America, I did not know it, oysters 

00:03:27.990 --> 00:03:31.320
 then it can be clear before him and 

00:03:30.210 --> 00:03:33.600
 after bows it reacts with the prey 

00:03:31.320 --> 00:03:37.370
 military and today is making this 

00:03:33.600 --> 00:03:37.370
 column is a column with 13 

00:03:48.090 --> 00:03:51.570
 we do not know when they will put it 

00:03:50.010 --> 00:03:53.070
 even if they are going to put it but today 

00:03:51.570 --> 00:03:54.240
 20,000 say that in the creator you see the 

00:03:53.070 --> 00:03:55.740
 word will go but you can not see the abdomen 

00:03:54.240 --> 00:03:57.180
 but on the texture well a 

00:03:55.740 --> 00:03:58.620
 basically that has been all the truth 

00:03:57.180 --> 00:04:00.420
 is that the information is the description 

00:03:58.620 --> 00:04:03.030
 if you want to take a look and it's a 

00:04:00.420 --> 00:04:04.320
 very cool information very interesting there 

00:04:03.030 --> 00:04:05.820
 one thing that fired me with lord just 

00:04:04.320 --> 00:04:07.080
 looking through the telescope and nothing anymore 

00:04:05.820 --> 00:04:09.330
 you know the favorite is programming or 

00:04:07.080 --> 00:04:11.340
 time and 2 approximate to God has been fixed 

00:04:09.330 --> 00:04:13.470
 that you see the playboy mansion from here 

00:04:11.340 --> 00:04:16.550
 with the operative one sees pounds already of 

00:04:13.470 --> 00:04:16.550
 pounds not to the playboy mansion 

00:04:19.410 --> 00:04:22.410
 and
