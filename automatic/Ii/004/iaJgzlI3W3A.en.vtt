00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:18.330
 Please excuse my lift but it 

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:18.960
 is quite spontaneous and very fast and it 

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:21.720
 is a wish 

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:23.160
 we make pina colada today 

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:25.529

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:28.320
 really warm there goes now 

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:30.060
 Every day I make pizza and then 

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:32.309
 i thought the kids colada is coming like 

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:32.730
 called and it is still there to wish 

00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:35.400
 lie 

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:37.650
 that's why I do not have any fast just all 

00:00:35.400 --> 00:00:41.670
 ingredients presented and located directly 

00:00:37.650 --> 00:00:44.269
 The recipe is out of the recipes and 

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:47.610
 I found as always in the infobox 

00:00:44.269 --> 00:00:50.489
 we need in it 300 grams 

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:52.320
 Pineapple in brackets fresh as juice or 

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:55.729
 out of the box as really take it here 

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:58.350
 out of the box and that's one of those 

00:00:55.729 --> 00:00:59.760
 drained weight 340 grams 

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:01.619
 I do not want to change anything here 

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:04.170
 I do not go away on the soft me 

00:01:01.619 --> 00:01:07.619
 do all that was needed there 

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:09.780
 Here are 120 grams of coconut milk 

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:11.909
 I also come here from a box and the 

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:14.909
 But first I have unfilled and 

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:19.859
 mixed through because you need to get rich 

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:21.689
 Robes and whipped cream and composition 

00:01:19.859 --> 00:01:24.359
 I was really lucky I was lucky 

00:01:21.689 --> 00:01:25.890
 everything there and then I have time to 

00:01:24.359 --> 00:01:28.829
 safety still a little orange juice 

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:30.869
 put down because I want to first look 

00:01:28.829 --> 00:01:35.399
 is back and how it tastes and 

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:37.439
 yes it is like that in which we directly go 

00:01:35.399 --> 00:01:40.619
 namely, all the ingredients can be put together in 

00:01:37.439 --> 00:01:45.630
 the tories when I'm three skin small 

00:01:40.619 --> 00:01:45.899
 said look like many really in it 

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:52.219
 is 

00:01:45.899 --> 00:01:52.219
 if that works well that certainly can not 

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:58.120
 590 grams 

00:01:55.810 --> 00:02:02.440
 There is even more in it than we are on it 

00:01:58.120 --> 00:02:08.130
 stands 565 stands we are 590 that 

00:02:02.440 --> 00:02:08.130
 is already so 120 km coconut milk 

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:18.430
 were quite 135 25 grams of sio 

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:26.020
 I have my belief that on the 

00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:26.860
 Kaufland Kaufmarkt somehow so me 

00:02:26.020 --> 00:02:34.200
 I meant well 

00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:34.200
 that was 35 140 grams of white rum 

00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:57.090
 you do not want to know or 250 so round 

00:02:55.200 --> 00:03:00.720
 60 grams cream I think I think so 

00:02:57.090 --> 00:03:11.640
 my foxes because so far so far 

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:13.820
 which sometimes comes out wondering 

00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:16.430
 Incidentally, here are cocktail glasses 

00:03:13.820 --> 00:03:20.250
 I do not own any funds 

00:03:16.430 --> 00:03:22.920
 that's the way it is and the whole 20 seconds 

00:03:20.250 --> 00:03:24.810
 at level 6 my other experienced 

00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:26.160
 So write that you do not agree with me 

00:03:24.810 --> 00:03:30.180
 I did not cut you either 

00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:37.440
 look and it works like this 20 

00:03:30.180 --> 00:03:39.390
 seconds 6 and go now if 

00:03:37.440 --> 00:03:47.370
 you should taste it would be yes I am 

00:03:39.390 --> 00:03:56.160
 yes and then look or man 

00:03:47.370 --> 00:03:57.420
 We really though a few pieces 

00:03:56.160 --> 00:04:07.860
 I'm even thinner here than that 

00:03:57.420 --> 00:04:12.150
 not happy but so diligent stop the 

00:04:07.860 --> 00:04:15.390
 is really good and I notice my for 

00:04:12.150 --> 00:04:17.160
 leadership was but me it's a bit 

00:04:15.390 --> 00:04:20.989
 little we are a few more people 

00:04:17.160 --> 00:04:23.490
 i have no idea izmir 

00:04:20.989 --> 00:04:26.820
 I will therefore with orange juice them 

00:04:23.490 --> 00:04:29.730
 stretch a bit or even people 

00:04:26.820 --> 00:04:31.290
 By the way, there is still a recipe for me 

00:04:29.730 --> 00:04:31.740
 I always believed that last year 

00:04:31.290 --> 00:04:36.720
 made 

00:04:31.740 --> 00:04:39.480
 one takes frozen pineapple and me 

00:04:36.720 --> 00:04:43.220
 coconut does not think so but the 

00:04:39.480 --> 00:04:43.220
 friends of course not right now 

00:04:46.040 --> 00:04:54.830
 through and I watch the same man 

00:04:52.440 --> 00:04:54.830
 other 

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:10.020
 that is and exactly the other recipe 

00:05:07.770 --> 00:05:12.090
 is a small dose of pineapple and pieces 

00:05:10.020 --> 00:05:14.130
 So the treasures would be a small dose 

00:05:12.090 --> 00:05:15.440
 then just a few means the pattern 

00:05:14.130 --> 00:05:18.690
 but be frozen 

00:05:15.440 --> 00:05:20.760
 150 grams batida de coco alternative for 

00:05:18.690 --> 00:05:23.910
 children's coconut milk and 1 liter 

00:05:20.760 --> 00:05:26.940
 orange juice and the excitement about it 

00:05:23.910 --> 00:05:34.680
 I think that now through the 

00:05:26.940 --> 00:05:36.200
 pipeline and not longer one does not 

00:05:34.680 --> 00:05:45.210
 so much reimann 

00:05:36.200 --> 00:05:47.700
 tell me breast was the organic said 

00:05:45.210 --> 00:05:50.430
 you have too much white rum perfect 

00:05:47.700 --> 00:05:52.140
 balanced because she jerks me back 

00:05:50.430 --> 00:05:53.400
 I will make you recipes 

00:05:52.140 --> 00:05:55.710
 then you can do that 

00:05:53.400 --> 00:05:57.090
 choose and I know the other one 

00:05:55.710 --> 00:05:58.860
 Tastes really delicious too 

00:05:57.090 --> 00:06:02.120
 My, that was not frozen 

00:05:58.860 --> 00:06:06.990
 That's why I did something different 

00:06:02.120 --> 00:06:08.880
 and yes cheaper I believe that 

00:06:06.990 --> 00:06:11.600
 will not take the other one 

00:06:08.880 --> 00:06:13.500
 costs money at tina dico costs money 

00:06:11.600 --> 00:06:15.570
 that does not matter, but both 

00:06:13.500 --> 00:06:19.380
 variations are really delicious 

00:06:15.570 --> 00:06:22.200
 a bit in and then I say okay 

00:06:19.380 --> 00:06:23.820
 a faster fine Chinese cabbage and me 

00:06:22.200 --> 00:06:25.650
 wish you a lot of fun 

00:06:23.820 --> 00:06:27.780
 from time to time the lottery diligently 

00:06:25.650 --> 00:06:30.030
 baked I left you again for 

00:06:27.780 --> 00:06:30.930
 I do not know and now wish 

00:06:30.030 --> 00:06:33.090
 I wish you a wonderful weekend 

00:06:30.930 --> 00:06:35.670
 because I think at the weekend would be now 

00:06:33.090 --> 00:06:37.260
 I turn and say no filmchen 

00:06:35.670 --> 00:06:39.590
