00:00:04.860 --> 00:00:11.969
 good friends today we are going to talk about the 

00:00:07.170 --> 00:00:14.760
 difference of use between as and like us and 

00:00:11.969 --> 00:00:17.760
 like are used to say what things or 

00:00:14.760 --> 00:00:20.250
 people are similar that is to say it is for 

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:22.470
 express similarity but when we use 

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:23.930
 one and when we use another that's what 

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:26.150
 we'll see 

00:00:23.930 --> 00:00:27.950
 well first of all like it 

00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:31.870
 we can use with a person that is 

00:00:27.950 --> 00:00:31.870
 for example a proper name 

00:00:32.490 --> 00:00:38.789
 or 

00:00:34.690 --> 00:00:38.789
 for example the protas 

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:45.410
 something like for example the wind 

00:00:50.410 --> 00:00:56.860
 or any other object or thing and then 

00:00:54.250 --> 00:01:00.520
 also an object pronoun also 

00:00:56.860 --> 00:01:03.060
 referred to person that can be me 

00:01:00.520 --> 00:01:03.060
 I 

00:01:05.830 --> 00:01:12.240
 etc 

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:15.600
 for example if spinks lakhmari 

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:19.370
 She talks like Mary speaks just like me 

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:22.670
 see in the same way as anyone 

00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:26.210
 for example there is your one like the wind 

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:29.140
 you run like the wind runs is the same 

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:32.340
 that the wind just as fast 

00:01:29.140 --> 00:01:34.840
 For example, passion will not go 

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:37.300
 nobody calls you like me 

00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:41.320
 in the same way that I then 

00:01:37.300 --> 00:01:43.780
 we have the first one we all like 

00:01:41.320 --> 00:01:46.180
 then the first one we have a person 

00:01:43.780 --> 00:01:47.170
 is going to be a man your brother or what 

00:01:46.180 --> 00:01:48.940
 be 

00:01:47.170 --> 00:01:51.160
 in the second we have a thing of 

00:01:48.940 --> 00:01:54.650
 weening and in the third we have a 

00:01:51.160 --> 00:01:57.580
 object pronoun for example me 

00:01:54.650 --> 00:01:59.390
 let's see now how it works 

00:01:57.580 --> 00:02:02.020
 usually carry 

00:01:59.390 --> 00:02:02.020
 a subject 

00:02:04.030 --> 00:02:12.330
 and an auxiliary 

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:16.940
 of the corresponding verb that usually 

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:16.940
 be in three in time 

00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:29.800
 as more more auxiliary subject 

00:02:27.310 --> 00:02:32.110
 that usually is usually from the present 

00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:35.790
 time let's see how this would change 

00:02:32.110 --> 00:02:38.970
 first sentence cheese picks la mer and 

00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:41.900
 she talks like mary 

00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:41.900
 what we would do would be 

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:51.480
 remove replace like by ace 

00:02:48.630 --> 00:02:54.420
 but now we need 

00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:58.019
 the subject is marilyn the mother herself and 

00:02:54.420 --> 00:03:01.670
 stays and the auxiliary presence that 

00:02:58.019 --> 00:03:06.780
 as it is third person the assistant is 2 

00:03:01.670 --> 00:03:09.750
 sparkle that is meritage she talks like 

00:03:06.780 --> 00:03:12.050
 Mary does it on how does Mary do we see 

00:03:09.750 --> 00:03:15.950
 the second 

00:03:12.050 --> 00:03:20.500
 You run like the wind because you can 

00:03:15.950 --> 00:03:20.500
 put like we can also put as 

00:03:20.660 --> 00:03:25.700
 but then we have to add the 

00:03:22.850 --> 00:03:27.890
 auxiliary of the corresponding verb in 

00:03:25.700 --> 00:03:30.200
 the time that corresponds to him brown is 

00:03:27.890 --> 00:03:33.730
 in present simple presence then 

00:03:30.200 --> 00:03:37.239
 we put also das 

00:03:33.730 --> 00:03:39.580
 jurdan as the wind das you run like the 

00:03:37.239 --> 00:03:42.610
 wind does it like the wind does 

00:03:39.580 --> 00:03:44.040
 the third sentence because we would do what 

00:03:42.610 --> 00:03:49.510
 same 

00:03:44.040 --> 00:03:51.640
 we substitute like for as and stem and not 

00:03:49.510 --> 00:03:56.560
 can be a subject so we have 

00:03:51.640 --> 00:04:00.360
 than to put something that is subject and that 

00:03:56.560 --> 00:04:06.890
 corresponds to me that is ay 

00:04:00.360 --> 00:04:06.890
 there are two because it takes hours 

00:04:07.560 --> 00:04:14.930
 nabai the option is there is nobody calls you 

00:04:11.400 --> 00:04:16.820
 how I do it as I love you 

00:04:14.930 --> 00:04:19.430
 look at the last option we have 

00:04:16.820 --> 00:04:22.970
 seen that the candle out there in songs or 

00:04:19.430 --> 00:04:28.000
 the informal language is not worth the psu like 

00:04:22.970 --> 00:04:31.940
 you instead of as well the right thing is more 

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:35.630
 not April to 2 and so there you will see like 

00:04:31.940 --> 00:04:39.380
 but like very informal language 

00:04:35.630 --> 00:04:41.479
 it says but the right thing would be more a 

00:04:39.380 --> 00:04:44.350
 time we have a prayer behind 

00:04:41.479 --> 00:04:48.849
 most auxiliary subject most auxiliary subject 

00:04:44.350 --> 00:04:50.889
 then we have to put as not light 

00:04:48.849 --> 00:04:53.889
 ok let's see two more couples of 

00:04:50.889 --> 00:04:55.360
 sentences using one with line that other 

00:04:53.889 --> 00:04:59.139
 cut we're going to start in this 

00:04:55.360 --> 00:05:02.199
 companys i speak longed for skirts you speak 

00:04:59.139 --> 00:05:03.370
 as your father does as you do it 

00:05:02.199 --> 00:05:07.030
 father 

00:05:03.370 --> 00:05:09.220
 but those contÃ¡s and with like i speak like 

00:05:07.030 --> 00:05:11.639
 and ofadac we do not put auxiliary 

00:05:09.220 --> 00:05:13.490
 simply your father 

00:05:11.639 --> 00:05:18.430
 like 

00:05:13.490 --> 00:05:22.150
 yes mosley that she moves like you 

00:05:18.430 --> 00:05:25.630
 like you a pronoun object 

00:05:22.150 --> 00:05:30.010
 but we do not put auxiliary however without 

00:05:25.630 --> 00:05:33.370
 embargo simmons to youtube she moves 

00:05:30.010 --> 00:05:39.190
 as you do it in the same way that 

00:05:33.370 --> 00:05:40.569
 you have subjected more auxiliary like by 

00:05:39.190 --> 00:05:44.469
 object name 

00:05:40.569 --> 00:05:46.620
 like person a proper name your father 

00:05:44.469 --> 00:05:48.750
 your brother and so on 

00:05:46.620 --> 00:05:52.870
