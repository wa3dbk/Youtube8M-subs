00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.730
 the b youth of psv looked up strangely then 

00:00:02.939 --> 00:00:07.740
 during the first training session of 2014 

00:00:05.730 --> 00:00:08.580
 not with the balls towards the field 

00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:10.170
 walked 

00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:13.679
 but were surprised by a visit from 

00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:15.360
 prodjuser brownie dutch and rapid errol 

00:00:13.679 --> 00:00:17.100

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:20.039
 with the b b1 and b2 

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:21.869

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:24.029

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:26.340
 the b1 and b2 and we actually have 

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:28.680
 decided to look okay so let it 

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:30.630
 think about what is a winner and well 

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:32.520
 those outcomes that go into our sales 

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:33.750
 one in there really i really hope what they do 

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:35.760
 learn that they are at least starting to think 

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:37.110
 about ok what makes me one now 

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:38.730
 winner what do I actually need 

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:41.280
 to always make my next steps 

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:42.809
 And besides, it's just about point too 

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:45.030
 to actually take up the wrap 

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:47.250
 but for the boys with their lyrics on 

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:48.960
 work could had of course first 

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:50.579
 an offer can be created 

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:52.710
 and if you dutch then brownie on the 

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:54.660
 Herdgang're walking around must happen 

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:56.430
 will be alright 

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:57.530
 this consists of several layers that 

00:00:56.430 --> 00:00:59.250
 I explained them 

00:00:57.530 --> 00:01:02.460
 for example, several different ones 

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:04.439
 instruments and I have them all one 

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:05.670
 one which let react 

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:06.930
 so in the end they have the same thing 

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:08.220
 offers made 

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:10.710
 what did you think of how they did that 

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:12.930
 in playing yes better than I expected 

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:16.650
 some have the best feeling for this mine 

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:19.140
 son and yes I thought what we would make then 

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:21.150
 well done and if not something then 

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:24.299
 the lyrics are of course finished 

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:27.030
 naturally or at least almost naturally with 

00:01:24.299 --> 00:01:31.460
 with the help of daryl the psv talents came 

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:31.460
 to some class and stripes goes a long way 

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:35.729
 in the beginning was the natural of the 

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:37.570
 mama of them no look who does what 

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:38.920
 no folders we just went 

00:01:37.570 --> 00:01:41.890
 small groups divided into the ging is just 

00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:44.710
 hard all pieces wonder what so 

00:01:41.890 --> 00:01:48.220
 had to deal with the club would have liked to win 

00:01:44.710 --> 00:01:49.900
 score you name it and clean up there 

00:01:48.220 --> 00:01:51.640
 but it went so fast 

00:01:49.900 --> 00:01:52.450
 what are things you can use them with 

00:01:51.640 --> 00:01:53.800
 help out 

00:01:52.450 --> 00:01:55.720
 yes you can occasionally help them or when 

00:01:53.800 --> 00:01:57.190
 they are stuck with rhymes 

00:01:55.720 --> 00:01:58.690
 no that have one called scraping to 

00:01:57.190 --> 00:02:01.030
 the pile and still ball of 

00:01:58.690 --> 00:02:02.619
 a professor or a howling 

00:02:01.030 --> 00:02:04.119
 so again and again what they do 

00:02:02.619 --> 00:02:06.220
 stuck with drama words or off and on 

00:02:04.119 --> 00:02:07.890
 add a sentence to it 

00:02:06.220 --> 00:02:12.910
 are therefore 1x slightly too short to slightly too long 

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:15.370
 written tough texts for the rest 

00:02:12.910 --> 00:02:17.739
 then there is only one thing left to do 

00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:19.989
 happen and that is to include the 

00:02:17.739 --> 00:02:22.030
 right and this too went after a difficult one 

00:02:19.989 --> 00:02:24.130
 start of smooth sailing 

00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:27.220
 where where to hold a little then 

00:02:24.130 --> 00:02:29.680
 a bit nervous but they are 

00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:33.190
 just pretend you're angry and with 

00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:38.050
 all the energy you have in it and me 

00:02:33.190 --> 00:02:39.640
 think this is a kind of psv i have 

00:02:38.050 --> 00:02:41.830
 had a lot of fun with my boys 

00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:43.420
 is a nice team of nice guys i like them 

00:02:41.830 --> 00:02:44.799
 also take a walk throw up once 

00:02:43.420 --> 00:02:46.780
 in agreement it's just sitting there 

00:02:44.799 --> 00:02:51.430
 good atmosphere and i enjoyed it 

00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:56.350
 think of course to french're angry 

00:02:51.430 --> 00:02:58.269
 a beast you must join 

00:02:56.350 --> 00:03:01.780
 you have to give everything 

00:02:58.269 --> 00:03:04.080
 soccer players still have to win 

00:03:01.780 --> 00:03:06.620
 to strive for you 

00:03:04.080 --> 00:03:08.330
 [Applause] 

00:03:06.620 --> 00:03:11.950
 curious about the full appetite 

00:03:08.330 --> 00:03:11.950
