Boone Jenner and Jonathan Huberdeau
specifically<00:04:37.690> because<00:04:37.960> of<00:04:38.380> the<00:04:38.500> elimination

00:04:39.300 --> 00:04:39.310 
specifically because of the elimination

00:04:39.310 --> 00:04:41.220 
specifically because of the elimination
game<00:04:39.520> last<00:04:39.760> year<00:04:39.880> against<00:04:40.240> Russia<00:04:40.510> in<00:04:40.810> which

00:04:41.220 --> 00:04:41.230 
game last year against Russia in which

00:04:41.230 --> 00:04:42.990 
game last year against Russia in which
penalty<00:04:41.770> wise<00:04:41.920> they<00:04:42.220> made<00:04:42.400> some<00:04:42.550> pretty<00:04:42.700> poor

00:04:42.990 --> 00:04:43.000 
penalty wise they made some pretty poor

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:45.030 
penalty wise they made some pretty poor
decisions<00:04:43.480> but<00:04:43.780> they're<00:04:44.230> good<00:04:44.440> players<00:04:44.650> and

00:04:45.030 --> 00:04:45.040 
decisions but they're good players and

00:04:45.040 --> 00:04:46.860 
decisions but they're good players and
the<00:04:45.460> hope<00:04:45.640> is<00:04:45.880> with<00:04:46.060> them<00:04:46.240> being<00:04:46.450> a<00:04:46.600> year<00:04:46.810> older

00:04:46.860 --> 00:04:46.870 
the hope is with them being a year older

00:04:46.870 --> 00:04:49.080 
the hope is with them being a year older
is<00:04:47.530> that<00:04:47.710> they're<00:04:47.890> you're<00:04:48.220> stronger<00:04:48.760> faster

00:04:49.080 --> 00:04:49.090 
is that they're you're stronger faster

00:04:49.090 --> 00:04:51.960 
is that they're you're stronger faster
better<00:04:49.390> and<00:04:49.950> smarter<00:04:50.950> let's<00:04:51.460> call<00:04:51.640> a<00:04:51.670> spade<00:04:51.730> a

00:04:51.960 --> 00:04:51.970 
better and smarter let's call a spade a

better and smarter let's call a spade a
spade<00:04:52.060> last<00:04:52.570> year<00:04:52.810> Russia<00:04:53.170> got<00:04:53.650> the<00:04:53.890> better<00:04:54.130> of

spade last year Russia got the better of
Canada<00:04:54.850> big<00:04:55.090> time<00:04:55.300> Canada<00:04:55.750> almost<00:04:56.110> came<00:04:56.290> back

00:04:56.460 --> 00:04:56.470 
Canada big time Canada almost came back

00:04:56.470 --> 00:04:57.990 
Canada big time Canada almost came back
in<00:04:56.620> the<00:04:56.710> third<00:04:56.920> and<00:04:57.010> it<00:04:57.100> was<00:04:57.190> really<00:04:57.430> exciting

00:04:57.990 --> 00:04:58.000 
in the third and it was really exciting

00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:00.330 
in the third and it was really exciting
and<00:04:58.060> awesome<00:04:58.570> but<00:04:59.170> if<00:04:59.410> Vin<00:04:59.710> Diesel<00:05:00.070> from<00:05:00.220> The

and awesome but if Vin Diesel from The

00:05:00.340 --> 00:05:01.350 
and awesome but if Vin Diesel from The
Fast<00:05:00.460> and<00:05:00.610> the<00:05:00.700> Furious<00:05:00.760> taught<00:05:01.150> me<00:05:01.270> anything

00:05:01.350 --> 00:05:01.360 
Fast and the Furious taught me anything

00:05:01.360 --> 00:05:04.290 
Fast and the Furious taught me anything
so<00:05:01.990> you<00:05:02.020> can't<00:05:02.470> almost<00:05:03.010> win<00:05:03.340> except<00:05:03.910> his<00:05:04.090> voice

00:05:04.290 --> 00:05:04.300 
so you can't almost win except his voice

00:05:04.300 --> 00:05:06.510 
so you can't almost win except his voice
is<00:05:04.510> like<00:05:04.660> you're<00:05:05.110> sorting<00:05:05.530> would<00:05:05.710> grow<00:05:05.890> up<00:05:06.100> a

00:05:06.510 --> 00:05:06.520 
is like you're sorting would grow up a

00:05:06.520 --> 00:05:08.370 
is like you're sorting would grow up a
little<00:05:06.700> dirt<00:05:06.940> and<00:05:07.480> I'm<00:05:07.630> predicting<00:05:08.050> it<00:05:08.170> could

00:05:08.370 --> 00:05:08.380 
little dirt and I'm predicting it could

00:05:08.380 --> 00:05:10.800 
little dirt and I'm predicting it could
come<00:05:08.650> down<00:05:08.680> to<00:05:08.890> Canada<00:05:09.520> Russia<00:05:09.730> again<00:05:10.330> which

00:05:10.800 --> 00:05:10.810 
come down to Canada Russia again which

00:05:10.810 --> 00:05:12.090 
come down to Canada Russia again which
is<00:05:10.960> why<00:05:11.110> I<00:05:11.140> want<00:05:11.380> to<00:05:11.410> emphasize<00:05:11.830> something

00:05:12.090 --> 00:05:12.100 
is why I want to emphasize something

00:05:12.100 --> 00:05:15.720 
is why I want to emphasize something
I've<00:05:12.310> said<00:05:12.520> in<00:05:12.610> the<00:05:12.640> past<00:05:13.320> Canada<00:05:14.320> plays<00:05:15.310> to

00:05:15.720 --> 00:05:15.730 
I've said in the past Canada plays to

00:05:15.730 --> 00:05:20.460 
I've said in the past Canada plays to
win<00:05:15.880> gold<00:05:16.830> rush'<00:05:17.830> plays<00:05:18.820> to<00:05:19.330> beat<00:05:19.540> canada<00:05:20.290> and

00:05:20.460 --> 00:05:20.470 
win gold rush' plays to beat canada and

00:05:20.470 --> 00:05:22.380 
win gold rush' plays to beat canada and
that<00:05:20.740> sounds<00:05:21.130> like<00:05:21.250> messed<00:05:21.490> up<00:05:21.640> logic<00:05:22.120> and<00:05:22.300> it

00:05:22.380 --> 00:05:22.390 
that sounds like messed up logic and it

00:05:22.390 --> 00:05:23.670 
that sounds like messed up logic and it
sounds<00:05:22.690> like<00:05:22.720> it<00:05:22.870> doesn't<00:05:23.020> make<00:05:23.170> sense<00:05:23.230> and<00:05:23.620> it

00:05:23.670 --> 00:05:23.680 
sounds like it doesn't make sense and it

00:05:23.680 --> 00:05:24.840 
sounds like it doesn't make sense and it
sounds<00:05:23.950> like<00:05:24.010> Canada<00:05:24.430> should<00:05:24.610> beat<00:05:24.700> them

00:05:24.840 --> 00:05:24.850 
sounds like Canada should beat them

00:05:24.850 --> 00:05:27.300 
sounds like Canada should beat them
every<00:05:25.060> time<00:05:25.240> not<00:05:25.990> the<00:05:26.170> case<00:05:26.350> because<00:05:26.650> Canada

00:05:27.300 --> 00:05:27.310 
every time not the case because Canada

00:05:27.310 --> 00:05:29.250 
every time not the case because Canada
plays<00:05:27.520> for<00:05:27.760> the<00:05:27.850> desire<00:05:28.180> to<00:05:28.210> win<00:05:28.390> and<00:05:29.140> that's

00:05:29.250 --> 00:05:29.260 
plays for the desire to win and that's

00:05:29.260 --> 00:05:30.660 
plays for the desire to win and that's
great<00:05:29.620> but<00:05:29.800> what<00:05:30.010> do<00:05:30.070> you<00:05:30.130> gotta<00:05:30.340> do<00:05:30.520> to<00:05:30.640> win

00:05:30.660 --> 00:05:30.670 
great but what do you gotta do to win

00:05:30.670 --> 00:05:33.840 
great but what do you gotta do to win
beat<00:05:31.570> you<00:05:32.260> and<00:05:32.650> that's<00:05:32.830> Russia's<00:05:33.340> mission<00:05:33.700> is

00:05:33.840 --> 00:05:33.850 
beat you and that's Russia's mission is

00:05:33.850 --> 00:05:36.090 
beat you and that's Russia's mission is
to<00:05:34.000> beat<00:05:34.240> you<00:05:34.510> more<00:05:34.870> than<00:05:35.050> win<00:05:35.290> does<00:05:35.800> that<00:05:35.920> make

00:05:36.090 --> 00:05:36.100 
to beat you more than win does that make

00:05:36.100 --> 00:05:37.440 
to beat you more than win does that make
sense<00:05:36.130> last<00:05:36.670> but<00:05:36.850> not<00:05:36.880> least<00:05:37.000> some
