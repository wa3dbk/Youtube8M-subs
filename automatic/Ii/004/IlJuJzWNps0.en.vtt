00:00:08.769 --> 00:00:11.320 

so<00:00:09.769> we're<00:00:09.920> going<00:00:10.009> to<00:00:10.070> talk<00:00:10.250> about<00:00:10.309> gluing<00:00:11.179> it's

00:00:11.320 --> 00:00:11.330 
so we're going to talk about gluing it's

00:00:11.330 --> 00:00:14.859 
so we're going to talk about gluing it's
sort<00:00:11.570> of<00:00:11.660> a<00:00:11.750> foundation<00:00:12.019> skill<00:00:13.690> here's<00:00:14.690> our

00:00:14.859 --> 00:00:14.869 
sort of a foundation skill here's our

00:00:14.869 --> 00:00:17.589 
sort of a foundation skill here's our
PVA<00:00:15.199> which<00:00:15.530> is<00:00:15.790> something<00:00:16.790> that<00:00:16.970> we<00:00:17.180> are<00:00:17.360> very

00:00:17.589 --> 00:00:17.599 
PVA which is something that we are very

00:00:17.599 --> 00:00:19.720 
PVA which is something that we are very
fond<00:00:17.990> of<00:00:18.200> it's<00:00:18.650> specially<00:00:19.099> formulated<00:00:19.400> for

00:00:19.720 --> 00:00:19.730 
fond of it's specially formulated for

00:00:19.730 --> 00:00:21.640 
fond of it's specially formulated for
paper<00:00:20.060> and<00:00:20.390> then<00:00:20.960> this<00:00:21.140> is<00:00:21.259> a<00:00:21.289> methyl

00:00:21.640 --> 00:00:21.650 
paper and then this is a methyl

00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:25.810 
paper and then this is a methyl
cellulose<00:00:22.450> which<00:00:23.920> when<00:00:24.920> you<00:00:25.010> buy<00:00:25.220> it<00:00:25.279> there's

00:00:25.810 --> 00:00:25.820 
cellulose which when you buy it there's

00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:29.830 
cellulose which when you buy it there's
some<00:00:26.179> white<00:00:26.390> powder<00:00:26.720> inside<00:00:27.529> and<00:00:28.599> you<00:00:29.599> think

00:00:29.830 --> 00:00:29.840 
some white powder inside and you think

00:00:29.840 --> 00:00:30.490 
some white powder inside and you think
huh

00:00:30.490 --> 00:00:30.500 
huh

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:33.759 
huh
is<00:00:31.310> this<00:00:31.670> a<00:00:31.699> drug<00:00:32.089> show<00:00:32.390> or<00:00:32.599> something<00:00:32.809> but<00:00:33.530> it

00:00:33.759 --> 00:00:33.769 
is this a drug show or something but it

00:00:33.769 --> 00:00:37.180 
is this a drug show or something but it
isn't<00:00:33.980> it's<00:00:34.250> just<00:00:34.339> good<00:00:34.699> old<00:00:35.379> methyl<00:00:36.379> cell<00:00:36.650> it

00:00:37.180 --> 00:00:37.190 
isn't it's just good old methyl cell it

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:40.420 
isn't it's just good old methyl cell it
we<00:00:38.089> use<00:00:38.330> it<00:00:38.540> with<00:00:38.750> the<00:00:39.019> PVA<00:00:39.410> it<00:00:39.800> extends<00:00:40.370> the

00:00:40.420 --> 00:00:40.430 
we use it with the PVA it extends the

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:42.520 
we use it with the PVA it extends the
drawing<00:00:40.760> time<00:00:41.000> and<00:00:41.180> make<00:00:41.300> it<00:00:41.329> slippier<00:00:42.140> it's

00:00:42.520 --> 00:00:42.530 
drawing time and make it slippier it's

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:44.950 
drawing time and make it slippier it's
easier<00:00:43.039> to<00:00:43.190> center<00:00:43.489> the<00:00:43.610> paper<00:00:43.850> with<00:00:44.090> it<00:00:44.239> it's

00:00:44.950 --> 00:00:44.960 
easier to center the paper with it it's

00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:47.650 
easier to center the paper with it it's
also<00:00:45.140> reversible<00:00:45.879> if<00:00:46.879> you<00:00:47.030> use<00:00:47.239> it<00:00:47.390> alone

00:00:47.650 --> 00:00:47.660 
also reversible if you use it alone

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:49.720 
also reversible if you use it alone
which<00:00:47.809> is<00:00:48.020> for<00:00:48.350> archivists<00:00:49.129> a<00:00:49.250> really<00:00:49.550> nice

00:00:49.720 --> 00:00:49.730 
which is for archivists a really nice

00:00:49.730 --> 00:00:52.150 
which is for archivists a really nice
little<00:00:49.940> feature<00:00:50.090> so<00:00:51.020> the<00:00:51.410> first<00:00:51.649> thing<00:00:51.860> you<00:00:51.980> do

00:00:52.150 --> 00:00:52.160 
little feature so the first thing you do

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:55.420 
little feature so the first thing you do
is<00:00:52.760> you<00:00:53.180> fill<00:00:53.750> it<00:00:53.930> with<00:00:53.960> hot<00:00:54.620> water<00:00:54.649> and<00:00:55.250> I've

00:00:55.420 --> 00:00:55.430 
is you fill it with hot water and I've

00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:57.549 
is you fill it with hot water and I've
gone<00:00:55.609> one<00:00:55.789> over<00:00:56.030> here<00:00:56.210> brewing<00:00:56.750> I<00:00:56.960> don't<00:00:57.500> know

00:00:57.549 --> 00:00:57.559 
gone one over here brewing I don't know

00:00:57.559 --> 00:00:58.990 
gone one over here brewing I don't know
if<00:00:57.649> you<00:00:57.710> got<00:00:57.859> it<00:00:58.100> still<00:00:58.370> hot<00:00:58.550> I<00:00:58.579> don't<00:00:58.730> know<00:00:58.940> if

00:00:58.990 --> 00:00:59.000 
if you got it still hot I don't know if

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:02.709 
if you got it still hot I don't know if
you<00:00:59.090> can<00:00:59.270> see<00:00:59.660> the<00:01:00.050> steam<00:01:00.640> but<00:01:01.640> it's<00:01:01.850> really

00:01:02.709 --> 00:01:02.719 
you can see the steam but it's really

00:01:02.719 --> 00:01:08.109 
you can see the steam but it's really
hot<00:01:02.930> and<00:01:03.879> that<00:01:04.879> is<00:01:05.180> what<00:01:05.750> them<00:01:06.880> dissolves<00:01:07.880> the

00:01:08.109 --> 00:01:08.119 
hot and that is what them dissolves the

00:01:08.119 --> 00:01:12.609 
hot and that is what them dissolves the
methyl<00:01:08.810> cell<00:01:09.050> and<00:01:09.350> then<00:01:10.190> you<00:01:10.460> add<00:01:11.229> an<00:01:12.229> equal

00:01:12.609 --> 00:01:12.619 
methyl cell and then you add an equal

00:01:12.619 --> 00:01:14.260 
methyl cell and then you add an equal
amount<00:01:12.799> of<00:01:12.950> cold<00:01:13.220> water<00:01:13.520> to<00:01:13.700> chill<00:01:14.119> it<00:01:14.240> down

00:01:14.260 --> 00:01:14.270 
amount of cold water to chill it down

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:20.520 
amount of cold water to chill it down
and<00:01:15.430> then<00:01:16.430> it<00:01:16.610> thickens<00:01:17.119> to<00:01:17.390> sort<00:01:17.630> of<00:01:17.689> a<00:01:17.840> muck

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:20.530 

00:01:20.530 --> 00:01:26.260 

it's<00:01:21.530> very<00:01:21.740> gelatinous<00:01:22.390> and<00:01:24.640> so<00:01:25.640> there's<00:01:25.939> that

00:01:26.260 --> 00:01:26.270 
it's very gelatinous and so there's that

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:28.630 
it's very gelatinous and so there's that
and<00:01:26.600> then<00:01:26.840> the<00:01:27.560> PVA<00:01:27.979> I've<00:01:28.340> already

00:01:28.630 --> 00:01:28.640 
and then the PVA I've already

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:32.640 
and then the PVA I've already
transferred<00:01:29.299> one<00:01:29.509> into<00:01:29.990> a<00:01:30.259> container<00:01:30.860> and

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:32.650 
transferred one into a container and

00:01:32.650 --> 00:01:34.780 
transferred one into a container and
putting<00:01:33.650> it<00:01:33.740> in<00:01:33.829> something<00:01:34.070> like<00:01:34.220> this<00:01:34.520> makes

00:01:34.780 --> 00:01:34.790 
putting it in something like this makes

00:01:34.790 --> 00:01:37.870 
putting it in something like this makes
gluing<00:01:35.479> really<00:01:35.930> easy<00:01:36.200> I<00:01:36.530> will<00:01:37.100> caution<00:01:37.670> you

00:01:37.870 --> 00:01:37.880 
gluing really easy I will caution you

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:41.830 
gluing really easy I will caution you
however<00:01:38.090> that<00:01:39.040> the<00:01:40.149> mixture<00:01:41.149> once<00:01:41.540> you<00:01:41.659> add

00:01:41.830 --> 00:01:41.840 
however that the mixture once you add

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:44.859 
however that the mixture once you add
this<00:01:42.049> to<00:01:42.290> it<00:01:42.409> becomes<00:01:42.920> has<00:01:43.700> a<00:01:43.729> shelf<00:01:44.149> life<00:01:44.270> so

00:01:44.859 --> 00:01:44.869 
this to it becomes has a shelf life so

00:01:44.869 --> 00:01:46.569 
this to it becomes has a shelf life so
you<00:01:44.930> don't<00:01:45.409> want<00:01:45.590> to<00:01:45.710> make<00:01:45.920> a<00:01:45.950> huge<00:01:46.340> amount

00:01:46.569 --> 00:01:46.579 
you don't want to make a huge amount

00:01:46.579 --> 00:01:48.789 
you don't want to make a huge amount
keep<00:01:47.180> this<00:01:47.420> separate<00:01:47.899> keep<00:01:48.200> this<00:01:48.380> separate

00:01:48.789 --> 00:01:48.799 
keep this separate keep this separate

00:01:48.799 --> 00:01:51.580 
keep this separate keep this separate
and<00:01:48.950> and<00:01:49.640> then<00:01:49.939> mix<00:01:50.689> it<00:01:50.810> into<00:01:50.930> here<00:01:51.170> so<00:01:51.320> here's

00:01:51.580 --> 00:01:51.590 
and and then mix it into here so here's

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:55.090 
and and then mix it into here so here's
my<00:01:51.860> PVA<00:01:52.399> which<00:01:53.149> is<00:01:53.299> 60%<00:01:53.719> of<00:01:54.259> my<00:01:54.439> mix<00:01:54.740> and<00:01:55.009> I'm

00:01:55.090 --> 00:01:55.100 
my PVA which is 60% of my mix and I'm

00:01:55.100 --> 00:02:00.039 
my PVA which is 60% of my mix and I'm
going<00:01:55.310> to<00:01:55.369> add<00:01:55.930> 40%<00:01:56.930> of<00:01:57.229> this<00:01:58.299> it's<00:01:59.299> not<00:01:59.659> it's

00:02:00.039 --> 00:02:00.049 
going to add 40% of this it's not it's

00:02:00.049 --> 00:02:02.050 
going to add 40% of this it's not it's
not<00:02:00.200> rocket<00:02:00.469> science<00:02:00.619> so<00:02:01.130> there<00:02:01.640> we<00:02:01.729> go<00:02:01.759> that's

00:02:02.050 --> 00:02:02.060 
not rocket science so there we go that's

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:05.170 
not rocket science so there we go that's
about<00:02:02.299> right<00:02:02.509> I<00:02:03.399> think<00:02:04.399> it's<00:02:04.640> I<00:02:04.789> think<00:02:04.820> it's<00:02:05.090> a

00:02:05.170 --> 00:02:05.180 
about right I think it's I think it's a

00:02:05.180 --> 00:02:11.080 
about right I think it's I think it's a
little<00:02:05.420> bit<00:02:05.600> too<00:02:05.780> much<00:02:05.960> in<00:02:06.170> but<00:02:06.409> we'll<00:02:06.680> see

00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:11.090 

00:02:11.090 --> 00:02:14.569 

you<00:02:12.090> can<00:02:12.269> always<00:02:12.719> fix<00:02:13.709> your<00:02:13.980> measurement<00:02:14.430> by

00:02:14.569 --> 00:02:14.579 
you can always fix your measurement by

00:02:14.579 --> 00:02:17.000 
you can always fix your measurement by
if<00:02:14.879> I<00:02:15.209> had<00:02:15.359> too<00:02:16.319> little

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:17.010 
if I had too little

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:19.520 
if I had too little
PVA<00:02:17.969> in<00:02:18.239> and<00:02:18.359> I<00:02:18.420> can<00:02:18.569> add<00:02:18.719> more<00:02:18.930> if<00:02:19.049> I<00:02:19.170> had<00:02:19.290> two

00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:19.530 
PVA in and I can add more if I had two

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:21.619 
PVA in and I can add more if I had two
little<00:02:19.680> metal<00:02:20.189> cell<00:02:20.549> I<00:02:20.760> can<00:02:20.790> add<00:02:21.150> more<00:02:21.390> of<00:02:21.510> that

00:02:21.619 --> 00:02:21.629 
little metal cell I can add more of that

00:02:21.629 --> 00:02:26.089 
little metal cell I can add more of that
too<00:02:21.870> so<00:02:22.590> here<00:02:22.859> we<00:02:22.980> go<00:02:23.329> the<00:02:24.329> perfect<00:02:25.099> the
