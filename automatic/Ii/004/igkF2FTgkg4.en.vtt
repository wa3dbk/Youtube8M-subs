00:00:07.070 --> 00:00:10.730
 Hello everyone I'm Marcelo I hope that 

00:00:09.260 --> 00:00:12.350
 are fine today I am going to 

00:00:10.730 --> 00:00:14.510
 show them how to make this beautiful 

00:00:12.350 --> 00:00:16.100
 hairstyle and for those who think that 

00:00:14.510 --> 00:00:17.960
 making a bond is difficult, I 'm going to 

00:00:16.100 --> 00:00:20.630
 show how to do it the most 

00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:23.030
 easy to make us perfect first 

00:00:20.630 --> 00:00:25.369
 we take a tail with all the hair and 

00:00:23.030 --> 00:00:29.140
 now let's separate a small part 

00:00:25.369 --> 00:00:31.849
 from above the tail to make the loop 

00:00:29.140 --> 00:00:37.250
 he combed it and now with a band 

00:00:31.849 --> 00:00:40.870
 elastic I'm going to take the first round 

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:40.870
 now the second 

00:00:41.500 --> 00:00:46.300
 now for the third round we are going to 

00:00:43.900 --> 00:00:49.570
 do the first half of the tie I'm going to 

00:00:46.300 --> 00:00:52.630
 combing then to be smooth 

00:00:49.570 --> 00:00:53.930
 and I'm going to pass the hair but not the 

00:00:52.630 --> 00:00:56.660
 all 

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:59.060
 here form the first half I turn to 

00:00:56.660 --> 00:01:02.000
 the bandit again the step to the other 

00:00:59.060 --> 00:01:06.350
 hand and to do the other side of the tie 

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:09.830
 I comb again and pass the hair through 

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:11.450
 the bandit without passing it all the more or 

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:13.729
 less accommodation so that the two halves 

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:16.470
 remain the same and the hair that I had left 

00:01:13.729 --> 00:01:19.930
 I pass it back 

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:22.210
 ready set the loop 

00:01:19.930 --> 00:01:24.810
 and now what I'm going to do is take a 

00:01:22.210 --> 00:01:27.570
 small part of the tail 

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:29.810
 to cover this rubber I will use the 

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:32.960
 tops and tale 

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:35.990
 I put it in the tail the hair that 

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:38.150
 I took it, I put it in the Ijalba arito 

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:42.140
 to the other side 

00:01:38.150 --> 00:01:44.870
 perfect it is super easy now the hair 

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:47.420
 that I have left over I use it to cover the 

00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:51.610
 band with which I caught the tail and subject 

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:51.610
 with hooks for hair 

00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:58.600
 super now how the subject loop is 

00:01:54.820 --> 00:02:01.659
 half with a hook I open it and do what 

00:01:58.600 --> 00:02:05.350
 same in the other half of the loop 

00:02:01.659 --> 00:02:08.410
 I arrange the tie as I need and to 

00:02:05.350 --> 00:02:10.539
 final I apply hair spray 

00:02:08.410 --> 00:02:12.180
 to control the hair that I 

00:02:10.539 --> 00:02:14.969
 remain loose 

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:17.700
 Look how beautiful it is fascinates me how 

00:02:14.969 --> 00:02:19.769
 it looks like they can leave it like that or also what 

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:22.500
 can combine with a braid that 

00:02:19.769 --> 00:02:24.359
 like I'm going to make a fish braid 

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:26.730
 that will be very simple by dividing the 

00:02:24.359 --> 00:02:29.010
 cabbage in two parts and always with a 

00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:31.829
 small part of hair on one side to 

00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:34.300
 join it with the other so I do it as 

00:02:31.829 --> 00:02:41.930
 they are seeing with the rest of the hair 

00:02:34.300 --> 00:02:45.039
 [Music] 

00:02:41.930 --> 00:02:45.039
 [Applause] 

00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:52.170
 and so the second option remains 

00:02:50.060 --> 00:02:53.130
 definitely hairstyles that are between 

00:02:52.170 --> 00:02:55.920
