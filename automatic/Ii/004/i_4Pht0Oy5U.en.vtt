your stem out set it off to the side run

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:36.440 
your stem out set it off to the side run
down<00:00:33.960> to<00:00:34.079> your<00:00:34.170> hardware<00:00:34.380> store<00:00:34.710> buy<00:00:35.640> a<00:00:35.670> 1024

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:36.450 
down to your hardware store buy a 1024

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:37.880 
down to your hardware store buy a 1024
stainless<00:00:36.989> screw<00:00:37.230> about<00:00:37.500> an<00:00:37.620> inch<00:00:37.739> and

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:37.890 
stainless screw about an inch and

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:43.729 
stainless screw about an inch and
quarter<00:00:38.040> long<00:00:39.920> on<00:00:40.920> a<00:00:40.980> 1024<00:00:41.610> screw<00:00:42.739> normally

00:00:43.729 --> 00:00:43.739 
quarter long on a 1024 screw normally

quarter long on a 1024 screw normally
the<00:00:44.010> head<00:00:44.250> will<00:00:45.059> not<00:00:45.300> fit<00:00:45.539> through<00:00:45.719> a<00:00:45.750> barrel

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:46.110 
the head will not fit through a barrel

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:47.389 
the head will not fit through a barrel
so<00:00:46.230> you're<00:00:46.350> gonna<00:00:46.469> have<00:00:46.590> to<00:00:46.710> shave<00:00:46.890> the<00:00:47.100> end<00:00:47.250> of

00:00:47.389 --> 00:00:47.399 
so you're gonna have to shave the end of

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:49.610 
so you're gonna have to shave the end of
the<00:00:47.600> screw<00:00:48.600> down<00:00:48.809> just<00:00:49.020> a<00:00:49.079> little<00:00:49.110> bit<00:00:49.320> so

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:49.620 
the screw down just a little bit so

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:50.690 
the screw down just a little bit so
it'll<00:00:49.710> go<00:00:49.860> through<00:00:50.070> the<00:00:50.129> end<00:00:50.219> of<00:00:50.340> the<00:00:50.399> barrel

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:50.700 
it'll go through the end of the barrel

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:52.459 
it'll go through the end of the barrel
you<00:00:50.820> want<00:00:51.030> to<00:00:51.120> verify<00:00:51.420> that<00:00:51.930> this<00:00:52.199> has

00:00:52.459 --> 00:00:52.469 
you want to verify that this has

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:55.279 
you want to verify that this has
happened<00:00:53.239> by<00:00:54.239> taking<00:00:54.600> the<00:00:54.690> barrel<00:00:54.989> off<00:00:55.079> and

00:00:55.279 --> 00:00:55.289 
happened by taking the barrel off and

00:00:55.289 --> 00:00:58.520 
happened by taking the barrel off and
you<00:00:55.350> stem<00:00:55.590> that<00:00:55.710> you've<00:00:55.829> purchased<00:00:57.320> make<00:00:58.320> sure

00:00:58.520 --> 00:00:58.530 
you stem that you've purchased make sure

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:00.349 
you stem that you've purchased make sure
that<00:00:58.680> screw<00:00:59.010> will<00:00:59.489> go<00:00:59.640> completely<00:00:59.850> through

00:01:00.349 --> 00:01:00.359 
that screw will go completely through

00:01:00.359 --> 00:01:01.760 
that screw will go completely through
the<00:01:00.420> barrel<00:01:00.719> if<00:01:00.840> it<00:01:00.930> hangs<00:01:01.140> up<00:01:01.320> this<00:01:01.500> trick

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:01.770 
the barrel if it hangs up this trick

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:05.539 
the barrel if it hangs up this trick
will<00:01:01.980> not<00:01:02.190> work<00:01:02.399> okay<00:01:04.400> once<00:01:05.400> you've

00:01:05.539 --> 00:01:05.549 
will not work okay once you've

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:10.640 
will not work okay once you've
determined<00:01:05.790> that<00:01:06.000> take<00:01:06.630> your<00:01:06.810> old<00:01:06.930> stem<00:01:09.650> screw

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:10.650 
determined that take your old stem screw

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:12.770 
determined that take your old stem screw
your<00:01:11.340> machine<00:01:11.670> screw<00:01:11.939> into<00:01:12.180> the<00:01:12.299> end<00:01:12.479> where

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:12.780 
your machine screw into the end where

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:15.490 
your machine screw into the end where
you<00:01:12.900> the<00:01:13.170> bib<00:01:13.350> screwed<00:01:13.680> normally<00:01:14.159> would<00:01:14.310> be

00:01:15.490 --> 00:01:15.500 
you the bib screwed normally would be

you the bib screwed normally would be
you<00:01:16.500> want<00:01:16.680> to<00:01:16.710> run<00:01:16.860> it<00:01:16.950> in<00:01:17.040> a<00:01:17.070> good<00:01:17.280> distance

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:17.580 
you want to run it in a good distance

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:19.190 
you want to run it in a good distance
because<00:01:17.790> you<00:01:17.909> do<00:01:18.180> not<00:01:18.330> want<00:01:18.600> this<00:01:18.869> screw<00:01:19.170> to

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:19.200 
because you do not want this screw to

because you do not want this screw to
Bend<00:01:19.680> while<00:01:20.100> it's<00:01:20.250> inside<00:01:20.549> your<00:01:20.700> valve<00:01:20.909> body

00:01:22.420 --> 00:01:22.430 
Bend while it's inside your valve body

00:01:22.430 --> 00:01:25.700 
Bend while it's inside your valve body
once<00:01:23.430> you<00:01:23.520> get<00:01:23.640> that<00:01:23.729> in<00:01:23.909> like<00:01:24.060> so<00:01:24.500> go<00:01:25.500> ahead
