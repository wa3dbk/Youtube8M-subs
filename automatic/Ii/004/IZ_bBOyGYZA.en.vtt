of practice is to make it weird in a
live<00:01:19.770> situation<00:01:19.979> you<00:01:20.460> don't<00:01:20.580> have<00:01:20.820> to<00:01:20.970> think

00:01:21.109 --> 00:01:21.119 
live situation you don't have to think

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:22.820 
live situation you don't have to think
about<00:01:21.270> it<00:01:21.509> you<00:01:21.990> just<00:01:22.020> do<00:01:22.350> what<00:01:22.500> you've<00:01:22.650> been

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:22.830 
about it you just do what you've been

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:25.420 
about it you just do what you've been
taught<00:01:23.040> to<00:01:23.189> do<00:01:23.340> you<00:01:23.430> do<00:01:23.580> your<00:01:23.729> job<00:01:23.970> if<00:01:24.180> you<00:01:24.210> all

00:01:25.420 --> 00:01:25.430 
taught to do you do your job if you all

00:01:25.430 --> 00:01:27.290 
taught to do you do your job if you all
when<00:01:26.430> something<00:01:26.700> like<00:01:26.730> that<00:01:26.820> happens<00:01:26.970> you

00:01:27.290 --> 00:01:27.300 
when something like that happens you

00:01:27.300 --> 00:01:29.240 
when something like that happens you
like<00:01:27.480> before<00:01:28.440> you<00:01:28.680> start<00:01:28.890> thinking<00:01:29.220> about

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:29.250 
like before you start thinking about

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:31.190 
like before you start thinking about
your<00:01:29.460> game<00:01:29.640> again<00:01:29.940> that<00:01:30.540> slows<00:01:30.810> it<00:01:30.930> down<00:01:30.960> even

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:31.200 
your game again that slows it down even

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:33.680 
your game again that slows it down even
more<00:01:31.520> put<00:01:32.520> you<00:01:32.670> on<00:01:32.730> the<00:01:32.850> defensive<00:01:32.940> and<00:01:33.570> that's

00:01:33.680 --> 00:01:33.690 
more put you on the defensive and that's

00:01:33.690 --> 00:01:35.450 
more put you on the defensive and that's
not<00:01:33.870> where<00:01:33.990> freshwater<00:01:34.290> wants<00:01:35.070> to<00:01:35.160> be<00:01:35.310> right

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:35.460 
not where freshwater wants to be right

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:38.620 
not where freshwater wants to be right
now<00:01:35.640> the<00:01:36.240> third<00:01:36.450> and<00:01:36.660> final<00:01:37.050> round

00:01:38.620 --> 00:01:38.630 
now the third and final round
