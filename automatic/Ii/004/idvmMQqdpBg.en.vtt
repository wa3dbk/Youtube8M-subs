am also using a controller I found it

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:47.810 
am also using a controller I found it
you<00:01:46.200> know<00:01:46.320> more<00:01:46.619> convenient<00:01:47.130> honestly<00:01:47.549> with

you know more convenient honestly with

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:50.539 
you know more convenient honestly with
some<00:01:48.450> games<00:01:48.720> with<00:01:49.530> third<00:01:49.770> person<00:01:50.159> games<00:01:50.369> at

00:01:50.539 --> 00:01:50.549 
some games with third person games at

00:01:50.549 --> 00:01:53.060 
some games with third person games at
least<00:01:50.670> on<00:01:50.880> the<00:01:50.970> computer<00:01:51.299> I<00:01:51.869> like<00:01:52.560> using<00:01:52.890> the

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:53.070 
least on the computer I like using the

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:54.940 
least on the computer I like using the
controller<00:01:53.159> so<00:01:53.700> that<00:01:54.030> works<00:01:54.210> out<00:01:54.360> for<00:01:54.479> me<00:01:54.540> so

00:01:54.940 --> 00:01:54.950 
controller so that works out for me so

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:57.080 
controller so that works out for me so
console<00:01:55.950> fans<00:01:56.219> I<00:01:56.369> guess<00:01:56.520> will<00:01:56.640> be<00:01:56.670> happy<00:01:57.000> about

00:01:57.080 --> 00:01:57.090

00:01:57.090 --> 00:01:59.300 
console fans I guess will be happy about
that<00:01:57.390> so<00:01:57.600> one<00:01:58.469> thing<00:01:58.619> that<00:01:58.649> I<00:01:58.829> won't<00:01:58.979> do<00:01:59.130> want

00:01:59.300 --> 00:01:59.310 
that so one thing that I won't do want

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:00.800 
that so one thing that I won't do want
to<00:01:59.340> point<00:01:59.520> out<00:01:59.670> you'll<00:01:59.880> notice<00:02:00.060> that<00:02:00.360> green

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:00.810 
to point out you'll notice that green

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:03.560 
to point out you'll notice that green
light<00:02:01.110> on<00:02:01.409> the<00:02:01.530> back<00:02:01.710> of<00:02:01.920> Sam's<00:02:02.340> back<00:02:02.790> it

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:03.570 
light on the back of Sam's back it

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:06.109 
light on the back of Sam's back it
lights<00:02:03.930> up<00:02:04.170> whenever<00:02:04.619> you're<00:02:04.890> in<00:02:05.040> the<00:02:05.490> shadows

00:02:06.109 --> 00:02:06.119 
lights up whenever you're in the shadows

00:02:06.119 --> 00:02:09.290 
lights up whenever you're in the shadows
so<00:02:06.390> if<00:02:06.869> that<00:02:07.020> light<00:02:07.290> goes<00:02:07.590> out<00:02:07.860> then<00:02:08.670> you<00:02:09.149> are

00:02:09.290 --> 00:02:09.300 
so if that light goes out then you are

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:10.969 
so if that light goes out then you are
in<00:02:09.479> the<00:02:09.629> light<00:02:09.840> and<00:02:10.140> you're<00:02:10.289> more<00:02:10.500> likely<00:02:10.890> to

00:03:34.960 --> 00:03:37.860 
so we're gonna go ahead and purchase the
tear<00:03:35.170> gas<00:03:35.200> but<00:03:35.980> now<00:03:36.130> you<00:03:36.190> see<00:03:36.610> that<00:03:36.850> we<00:03:37.600> don't

00:03:37.860 --> 00:03:37.870 
tear gas but now you see that we don't

00:03:37.870 --> 00:03:39.810 
tear gas but now you see that we don't
have<00:03:38.050> enough<00:03:38.320> money<00:03:38.590> to<00:03:39.160> get<00:03:39.280> the<00:03:39.400> sleeping

00:03:39.810 --> 00:03:39.820 
have enough money to get the sleeping

00:03:39.820 --> 00:03:42.990 
have enough money to get the sleeping
gas<00:03:40.000> so<00:03:40.660> you<00:03:41.440> can<00:03:41.620> replay<00:03:42.070> single-player

00:03:42.990 --> 00:03:43.000 
gas so you can replay single-player

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:45.360 
gas so you can replay single-player
missions<00:03:43.480> you<00:03:43.750> can<00:03:43.780> get<00:03:44.110> money<00:03:44.380> you<00:03:44.980> can<00:03:45.130> also

00:03:45.360 --> 00:03:45.370 
missions you can get money you can also

00:03:45.370 --> 00:03:47.280 
missions you can get money you can also
play<00:03:45.880> multiplayer<00:03:46.330> so<00:03:46.840> that's<00:03:47.050> what<00:03:47.260> I
