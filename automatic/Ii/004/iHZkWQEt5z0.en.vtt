00:00:03.449 --> 00:00:07.959
So the other day I was surfing the internet,
and I was like "you know what's really missing?

00:00:07.959 --> 00:00:13.530
Cats! I mean I just can't find cat-related
content ANYWHERE! It's like the internet doesn't

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:14.839
even know that cats exist!

00:00:14.839 --> 00:00:20.399
So to fix this problem, I chose today to recreate
these cat-themed socks. This photo of cat

00:00:20.399 --> 00:00:25.759
socks was sent to me by Mag Pie, and are originally
by... I don't know who. All I could find is

00:00:25.759 --> 00:00:29.700
that they're made in Korea. And, you seem
to be able to buy them on Ebay for $7. But

00:00:29.700 --> 00:00:34.480
I had some scungey old pairs of socks that
need upcycling, so let's see if I can recreate

00:00:34.480 --> 00:00:34.850
it.

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:39.360
So here are those old socks that I just mentioned.
I have one matching pair, and a single sock

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:44.510
whose partner I can’t find anywhere, so
I’m going to use this sock to make the cat’s

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:44.920
ears.

00:00:44.920 --> 00:00:48.620
To make that cat ears, the first thing that
I did was to draw 4 equal-sized triangles

00:00:48.620 --> 00:00:53.550
onto this sock, and cut each one out, cutting
through both of the layers. So I ended up

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:59.640
with 8 identical triangle pieces, paired each
one up, then sewed around each ear like this.

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:03.920
And I sewed them together using a long, wide
zig-zag stitch.

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:08.210
I trimmed off the corners and the extra seam
allowance,

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:10.359
And then I turned each ear inside out.

00:01:10.359 --> 00:01:13.060
So now I have four cat ears!

00:01:13.060 --> 00:01:16.939
I then put the other pair of socks onto my
feet to figure out where I should place the

00:01:16.939 --> 00:01:17.609
ears.

00:01:17.609 --> 00:01:22.359
And I ended up deciding to put the ears onto
the front of the sock, instead of on the side.

00:01:22.359 --> 00:01:26.569
This is because someone else also sent me
a picture of these shoes the other day, and

00:01:26.569 --> 00:01:31.630
I really liked how they looked. So the socks
that I want to make are kind of a combination

00:01:31.630 --> 00:01:34.539
between both these socks and these shoes.

00:01:34.539 --> 00:01:38.249
When I figured out a good placement for each
ear, I made a small pen mark on the inside

00:01:38.249 --> 00:01:40.639
of the sock, and on each ear.

00:01:40.639 --> 00:01:45.829
And I also pinned them into place.

00:01:45.829 --> 00:01:50.590
Then I simply top-stitched over the ear and
the sock to attach it the two together, again

00:01:50.590 --> 00:01:56.709
using a long zig-zag stitch. I also stretched
the sock as I sewed the ears on, to approximately

00:01:56.709 --> 00:02:00.219
the width of my ankle.

00:02:00.219 --> 00:02:05.169
Then, with this image as a reference, I used
a black permanent marker to draw a cat face

00:02:05.169 --> 00:02:10.380
onto the sock, in the middle of the sewn-on
ears, with something inside the sock to both

00:02:10.380 --> 00:02:15.650
stretch the sock, and to protect the other
side from the pen bleeding through. Now, google

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:20.150
told me that using a normal sharpie would
be just fine, and that the pen wouldn't run

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:25.640
when you put it in the wash, HOWEVER if you’re
super concerned about this, then get yourself

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:27.400
one of these pens.

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:31.820
Then I just repeated this on the other sock,
and I’m done!

00:02:31.820 --> 00:02:37.660

00:02:42.740 --> 00:02:45.219
So that's all I did! And my conclusion is:

00:02:45.219 --> 00:02:46.450
[scissor snipping sound effect]

00:02:46.450 --> 00:02:50.519
So they don't look exactly like the photo
that Mag Pie sent me - because I wanted to

00:02:50.519 --> 00:02:54.159
change it up a little bit, and have the cat
face at the front. But I'm still really really

00:02:54.159 --> 00:02:55.599
happy with how they turned out!

00:02:55.599 --> 00:02:59.760
And thanks to my efforts, I'm now pleased
to report that the internet has *finally*

00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:00.629
discovered cats.

00:03:00.629 --> 00:03:04.180
See you all for my next video! Bye!
