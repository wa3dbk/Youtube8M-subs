done<00:01:46.350> everything<00:01:46.770> and<00:01:46.950> you're<00:01:47.369> on<00:01:47.490> a<00:01:47.549> mac<00:01:47.759> it

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:48.000 
done everything and you're on a mac it

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:49.639 
done everything and you're on a mac it
should<00:01:48.240> look<00:01:48.390> something<00:01:48.450> like<00:01:48.750> this<00:01:48.869> it's

00:01:49.639 --> 00:01:49.649 
should look something like this it's

00:01:49.649 --> 00:01:51.980 
should look something like this it's
basically<00:01:50.009> to<00:01:50.820> manage<00:01:51.090> this<00:01:51.240> you're<00:01:51.600> going<00:01:51.840> to

00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:51.990 
basically to manage this you're going to

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:53.960 
basically to manage this you're going to
go<00:01:52.140> to<00:01:52.380> connections<00:01:53.310> in<00:01:53.460> the<00:01:53.549> upper<00:01:53.729> left<00:01:53.909> hand

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:53.970 
go to connections in the upper left hand

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:57.560 
go to connections in the upper left hand
corner<00:01:54.119> and<00:01:54.390> click<00:01:54.479> connect<00:01:55.939> then<00:01:56.939> it'll<00:01:57.390> come

00:01:57.560 --> 00:01:57.570 
corner and click connect then it'll come

00:01:57.570 --> 00:01:59.209 
corner and click connect then it'll come
up<00:01:57.630> with<00:01:57.780> you<00:01:57.899> to<00:01:58.020> dress<00:01:58.229> in<00:01:58.409> the<00:01:58.469> port<00:01:58.740> and<00:01:58.920> now

00:01:59.209 --> 00:01:59.219 
up with you to dress in the port and now

00:01:59.219 --> 00:02:00.740 
up with you to dress in the port and now
on<00:01:59.399> pc<00:02:00.030> you'll<00:02:00.180> probably<00:02:00.360> get<00:02:00.540> something

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:00.750 
on pc you'll probably get something

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:02.510 
on pc you'll probably get something
different<00:02:01.170> than<00:02:01.290> this<00:02:01.409> but<00:02:01.920> basically<00:02:02.219> it<00:02:02.399> is

00:02:02.510 --> 00:02:02.520 
different than this but basically it is

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:04.670 
different than this but basically it is
going<00:02:02.759> to<00:02:02.850> have<00:02:03.000> some<00:02:03.869> sort<00:02:03.990> of<00:02:04.110> connections

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:04.680 
going to have some sort of connections

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:06.139 
going to have some sort of connections
button<00:02:05.070> or<00:02:05.189> something<00:02:05.310> like<00:02:05.549> that<00:02:05.610> or<00:02:05.790> added

00:02:06.139 --> 00:02:06.149 
button or something like that or added

00:02:06.149 --> 00:02:08.180 
button or something like that or added
new<00:02:06.299> connection<00:02:06.770> basically<00:02:07.770> you're<00:02:07.920> going<00:02:08.099> to

00:02:08.180 --> 00:02:08.190 
new connection basically you're going to

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:10.820 
new connection basically you're going to
click<00:02:08.369> that<00:02:08.489> and<00:02:08.819> it's<00:02:09.119> and<00:02:09.390> you<00:02:09.810> will<00:02:09.989> you<00:02:10.560> may

00:02:10.820 --> 00:02:10.830 
click that and it's and you will you may

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:12.619 
click that and it's and you will you may
or<00:02:10.979> may<00:02:11.069> not<00:02:11.099> have<00:02:11.400> a<00:02:11.430> port<00:02:11.760> box<00:02:11.970> most<00:02:12.330> likely

00:02:12.619 --> 00:02:12.629 
or may not have a port box most likely

00:02:12.629 --> 00:02:13.260 
or may not have a port box most likely
not

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:13.270 
not

00:02:13.270 --> 00:02:16.350 
not
so<00:02:13.420> if<00:02:13.630> you<00:02:13.750> don't<00:02:13.990> then<00:02:14.470> just<00:02:14.500> type<00:02:15.240> here<00:02:16.240> i'll

00:02:16.350 --> 00:02:16.360 
so if you don't then just type here i'll

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:18.090 
so if you don't then just type here i'll
just<00:02:16.540> type<00:02:16.630> it<00:02:16.780> in<00:02:16.870> my<00:02:16.960> nickname<00:02:17.320> so<00:02:17.800> basically

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:18.100 
just type it in my nickname so basically

00:02:18.100 --> 00:02:23.580 
just type it in my nickname so basically
type<00:02:18.400> the<00:02:18.550> IP<00:02:18.750> just<00:02:19.750> 2<00:02:19.900> or<00:02:19.930> 3<00:02:20.140> 2<00:02:20.520> 39<00:02:21.520> 1<00:02:22.510> 149<00:02:22.990> 150

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:23.590 
type the IP just 2 or 3 2 39 1 149 150

00:02:23.590 --> 00:02:25.710 
type the IP just 2 or 3 2 39 1 149 150
and<00:02:23.830> then<00:02:24.190> just<00:02:24.370> send<00:02:24.610> me<00:02:24.640> colon<00:02:25.030> and<00:02:25.240> then<00:02:25.600> the

00:02:25.710 --> 00:02:25.720 
and then just send me colon and then the

00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:27.840 
and then just send me colon and then the
port<00:02:25.990> going<00:02:26.290> back<00:02:26.500> and<00:02:26.740> that<00:02:26.800> should<00:02:27.490> work<00:02:27.520> for

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:27.850 
port going back and that should work for

00:02:27.850 --> 00:02:35.820 
port going back and that should work for
you<00:02:27.960> but<00:02:28.960> on<00:02:29.140> max<00:02:33.660> changes<00:02:34.660> and<00:02:35.140> so<00:02:35.320> currently

00:02:35.820 --> 00:02:35.830 
you but on max changes and so currently

00:02:35.830 --> 00:02:37.260 
you but on max changes and so currently
the<00:02:36.070> password<00:02:36.430> is<00:02:36.520> blank<00:02:36.550> because<00:02:36.910> there's<00:02:37.150> no

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:37.270 
the password is blank because there's no

00:02:37.270 --> 00:02:41.160 
the password is blank because there's no
password<00:02:37.720> the<00:02:38.170> port<00:02:38.440> is<00:02:38.590> 10<00:02:39.430> 407<00:02:40.150> and<00:02:40.300> scip<00:02:40.810> and

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:41.170 
password the port is 10 407 and scip and

00:02:41.170 --> 00:02:44.130 
password the port is 10 407 and scip and
I<00:02:41.680> got<00:02:42.220> the<00:02:42.370> IP<00:02:42.520> from<00:02:43.120> right<00:02:43.600> here<00:02:43.870> the

00:02:44.130 --> 00:02:44.140 
I got the IP from right here the

00:02:44.140 --> 00:02:47.130 
I got the IP from right here the
teamspeak<00:02:44.470> address<00:02:44.920> some<00:02:45.730> reason<00:02:46.140> the

00:02:47.130 --> 00:02:47.140 
teamspeak address some reason the

00:02:47.140 --> 00:02:48.570 
teamspeak address some reason the
website<00:02:47.560> automatically<00:02:48.010> makes<00:02:48.280> it<00:02:48.400> into<00:02:48.550> a

00:02:48.570 --> 00:02:48.580 
website automatically makes it into a

00:02:48.580 --> 00:02:50.130 
website automatically makes it into a
link<00:02:48.820> but<00:02:49.000> it'll<00:02:49.240> just<00:02:49.390> take<00:02:49.480> you<00:02:49.540> to<00:02:49.720> this<00:02:49.870> and

00:02:50.130 --> 00:02:50.140 
link but it'll just take you to this and

00:02:50.140 --> 00:02:51.720 
link but it'll just take you to this and
the<00:02:50.620> IP<00:02:50.770> is<00:02:50.980> right<00:02:51.100> there<00:02:51.250> and<00:02:51.370> you<00:02:51.430> can<00:02:51.490> copy

00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:51.730 
the IP is right there and you can copy

00:02:51.730 --> 00:02:54.150 
the IP is right there and you can copy
and<00:02:51.910> paste<00:02:51.970> it<00:02:52.270> but<00:02:52.600> um<00:02:52.810> sometimes<00:02:53.680> copy<00:02:53.980> and

00:02:54.150 --> 00:02:54.160 
and paste it but um sometimes copy and

00:02:54.160 --> 00:02:55.500 
and paste it but um sometimes copy and
pasting<00:02:54.490> doesn't<00:02:54.790> work<00:02:54.910> so<00:02:55.120> you<00:02:55.210> may<00:02:55.330> have<00:02:55.360> to

00:02:55.500 --> 00:02:55.510 
pasting doesn't work so you may have to

00:02:55.510 --> 00:03:00.270 
pasting doesn't work so you may have to
type<00:02:55.750> it<00:02:55.870> in<00:02:56.020> manually<00:02:56.530> and<00:02:58.260> of<00:02:59.260> course<00:02:59.560> the

00:03:00.270 --> 00:03:00.280 
type it in manually and of course the

00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:03.990 
type it in manually and of course the
port<00:03:00.730> is<00:03:00.880> here<00:03:01.150> too<00:03:01.360> which<00:03:02.170> is<00:03:02.200> 10<00:03:03.070> 407<00:03:03.640> I<00:03:03.760> think

00:03:03.990 --> 00:03:04.000 
port is here too which is 10 407 I think

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:07.290 
port is here too which is 10 407 I think
I<00:03:04.060> already<00:03:04.090> said<00:03:04.420> that<00:03:04.600> but<00:03:05.050> uh<00:03:06.000> right<00:03:07.000> so<00:03:07.240> you

00:03:07.290 --> 00:03:07.300 
I already said that but uh right so you

00:03:07.300 --> 00:03:09.030 
I already said that but uh right so you
open<00:03:07.570> this<00:03:07.660> up<00:03:07.870> and<00:03:08.050> then<00:03:08.260> you<00:03:08.680> just<00:03:08.890> click

00:03:09.030 --> 00:03:09.040 
open this up and then you just click

00:03:09.040 --> 00:03:10.770 
open this up and then you just click
connect<00:03:09.430> same<00:03:09.880> with<00:03:10.090> PC<00:03:10.450> there<00:03:10.630> should<00:03:10.750> just

00:03:10.770 --> 00:03:10.780 
connect same with PC there should just

00:03:10.780 --> 00:03:13.650 
connect same with PC there should just
be<00:03:10.960> a<00:03:11.050> connect<00:03:11.440> button<00:03:11.640> basically<00:03:12.640> it<00:03:12.910> uh<00:03:12.970> it

00:03:13.650 --> 00:03:13.660 
be a connect button basically it uh it

00:03:13.660 --> 00:03:15.270 
be a connect button basically it uh it
should<00:03:13.720> just<00:03:14.110> bring<00:03:14.260> you<00:03:14.410> in<00:03:14.560> and<00:03:14.800> you'll<00:03:14.980> find

00:03:15.270 --> 00:03:15.280 
should just bring you in and you'll find

00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:17.850 
should just bring you in and you'll find
the<00:03:15.490> default<00:03:15.910> Channel<00:03:16.270> and<00:03:16.500> post<00:03:17.500> some<00:03:17.680> other

00:03:17.850 --> 00:03:17.860 
the default Channel and post some other

00:03:17.860 --> 00:03:19.320 
the default Channel and post some other
channels<00:03:18.280> by<00:03:18.400> the<00:03:18.459> time<00:03:18.670> I<00:03:18.700> put<00:03:19.060> this<00:03:19.180> video

00:03:19.320 --> 00:03:19.330 
channels by the time I put this video

00:03:19.330 --> 00:03:21.420 
channels by the time I put this video
out<00:03:19.510> but<00:03:20.260> basically<00:03:20.440> others<00:03:21.040> there's

00:03:21.420 --> 00:03:21.430 
out but basically others there's

00:03:21.430 --> 00:03:25.710 
out but basically others there's
currently<00:03:21.760> 40<00:03:22.180> slots<00:03:22.420> and<00:03:24.150> you<00:03:25.150> can<00:03:25.330> come<00:03:25.570> in

00:03:25.710 --> 00:03:25.720 
currently 40 slots and you can come in

00:03:25.720 --> 00:03:28.710 
currently 40 slots and you can come in
and<00:03:25.990> if<00:03:26.470> you're<00:03:27.100> i'm<00:03:27.700> going<00:03:28.150> to<00:03:28.209> set<00:03:28.390> up<00:03:28.480> brakes

00:03:28.710 --> 00:03:28.720 
and if you're i'm going to set up brakes

00:03:28.720 --> 00:03:30.960 
and if you're i'm going to set up brakes
most<00:03:29.080> likely<00:03:29.440> so<00:03:29.680> mod<00:03:30.190> pluses<00:03:30.640> a<00:03:30.670> lot<00:03:30.850> of

00:03:30.960 --> 00:03:30.970 
most likely so mod pluses a lot of

00:03:30.970 --> 00:03:32.880 
most likely so mod pluses a lot of
special<00:03:31.390> powers<00:03:31.720> and<00:03:31.930> access<00:03:32.380> to<00:03:32.410> special

00:03:32.880 --> 00:03:32.890 
special powers and access to special

00:03:32.890 --> 00:03:34.830 
special powers and access to special
channels<00:03:33.280> but<00:03:33.760> basically<00:03:34.180> that<00:03:34.480> stuff<00:03:34.750> to
