windproof ones it claims to be wind

00:00:54.539 --> 00:00:58.099 
windproof ones it claims to be wind
proof<00:00:54.750> it's<00:00:55.500> more<00:00:55.739> like<00:00:55.920> wind<00:00:56.370> resistant<00:00:57.109> this

00:00:58.099 --> 00:00:58.109 
proof it's more like wind resistant this

00:00:58.109 --> 00:01:00.170 
proof it's more like wind resistant this
one<00:00:58.350> is<00:00:58.469> in<00:00:58.649> trouble<00:00:59.039> only<00:00:59.250> lights<00:00:59.670> about<00:00:59.940> half

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:00.180 
one is in trouble only lights about half

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:05.119 
one is in trouble only lights about half
the<00:01:00.390> time<00:01:02.930> that<00:01:03.930> is<00:01:04.199> initiated<00:01:04.890> by<00:01:05.070> this

00:01:05.119 --> 00:01:05.129 
the time that is initiated by this

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:09.050 
the time that is initiated by this
mechanism<00:01:06.500> which<00:01:07.500> is<00:01:07.650> a<00:01:07.680> slider<00:01:07.979> crank<00:01:08.250> a<00:01:08.700> type

00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:09.060 
mechanism which is a slider crank a type

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:10.969 
mechanism which is a slider crank a type
of<00:01:09.090> four<00:01:09.420> bar<00:01:09.659> I've<00:01:10.229> made<00:01:10.500> this<00:01:10.680> out<00:01:10.950> of

00:01:10.969 --> 00:01:10.979 
of four bar I've made this out of

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:14.480 
of four bar I've made this out of
aluminum<00:01:11.490> by<00:01:11.670> hand<00:01:12.770> basically<00:01:13.770> just<00:01:14.100> takes<00:01:14.369> a

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:14.490 
aluminum by hand basically just takes a

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:16.760 
aluminum by hand basically just takes a
rotational<00:01:15.060> movement<00:01:15.479> of<00:01:15.570> the<00:01:15.689> wrist<00:01:15.930> turns

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:16.770 
rotational movement of the wrist turns

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:18.649 
rotational movement of the wrist turns
it<00:01:16.950> into<00:01:17.100> translational<00:01:17.939> movement<00:01:18.060> to<00:01:18.450> push

00:01:18.649 --> 00:01:18.659 
it into translational movement to push

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:23.420 
it into translational movement to push
down<00:01:18.810> on<00:01:18.869> the<00:01:19.170> trigger<00:01:20.540> so<00:01:21.540> that's<00:01:21.960> it<00:01:22.430> sounds

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:23.430 
down on the trigger so that's it sounds

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:26.090 
down on the trigger so that's it sounds
simple<00:01:23.790> not<00:01:24.240> so<00:01:24.540> simple<00:01:24.750> to<00:01:24.930> build<00:01:25.229> but<00:01:25.500> mount

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:26.100 
simple not so simple to build but mount

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:29.420 
simple not so simple to build but mount
it<00:01:26.189> on<00:01:26.280> here<00:01:26.930> you<00:01:27.930> put<00:01:28.140> it<00:01:28.229> on<00:01:28.320> your<00:01:28.500> wrist<00:01:28.650> if

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:29.430 
it on here you put it on your wrist if

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:33.750 
it on here you put it on your wrist if
your<00:01:29.610> hand<00:01:29.790> moves<00:01:30.000> back<00:01:30.439> ignites<00:01:31.439> it

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:33.760 

00:01:33.760 --> 00:01:37.899 

second<00:01:34.760> stage<00:01:34.970> is<00:01:35.390> fuel<00:01:35.870> delivery<00:01:36.790> this<00:01:37.790> is<00:01:37.880> a

00:01:37.899 --> 00:01:37.909 
second stage is fuel delivery this is a

00:01:37.909 --> 00:01:39.280 
second stage is fuel delivery this is a
more<00:01:38.150> dangerous<00:01:38.360> part

00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:39.290 
more dangerous part

00:01:39.290 --> 00:01:43.900 
more dangerous part
hence<00:01:39.590> key<00:01:40.460> switch<00:01:41.710> this<00:01:42.710> key<00:01:43.250> switch<00:01:43.550> here

00:01:43.900 --> 00:01:43.910 
hence key switch this key switch here

00:01:43.910 --> 00:01:46.870 
hence key switch this key switch here
enables<00:01:44.470> the<00:01:45.470> fuel<00:01:45.860> delivery<00:01:46.310> system<00:01:46.700> which

00:01:46.870 --> 00:01:46.880 
enables the fuel delivery system which

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:50.560 
enables the fuel delivery system which
is<00:01:47.030> electronic<00:01:47.540> so<00:01:48.850> it<00:01:49.850> can't<00:01:50.090> really<00:01:50.330> do<00:01:50.540> much

00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:50.570 
is electronic so it can't really do much

00:01:50.570 --> 00:01:54.100 
is electronic so it can't really do much
without<00:01:51.110> that<00:01:51.530> in<00:01:52.540> there<00:01:53.540> are<00:01:53.630> two<00:01:53.810> switches

00:01:54.100 --> 00:01:54.110 
without that in there are two switches

00:01:54.110 --> 00:01:56.830 
without that in there are two switches
that<00:01:54.410> initiate<00:01:54.830> fuel<00:01:55.100> delivery<00:01:55.630> one<00:01:56.630> of<00:01:56.720> them

00:01:56.830 --> 00:01:56.840 
that initiate fuel delivery one of them

00:01:56.840 --> 00:01:58.630 
that initiate fuel delivery one of them
is<00:01:56.960> a<00:01:56.990> key<00:01:57.229> switch<00:01:57.530> and<00:01:57.979> one<00:01:58.160> of<00:01:58.250> them<00:01:58.369> is<00:01:58.490> right

00:01:58.630 --> 00:01:58.640 
is a key switch and one of them is right

00:01:58.640 --> 00:02:05.740 
is a key switch and one of them is right
here<00:02:02.740> this<00:02:03.740> main<00:02:04.009> switch<00:02:04.369> to<00:02:05.119> initiate<00:02:05.479> fuel

00:02:05.740 --> 00:02:05.750 
here this main switch to initiate fuel

00:02:05.750 --> 00:02:07.900 
here this main switch to initiate fuel
delivery<00:02:06.259> is<00:02:07.009> triggered<00:02:07.399> by<00:02:07.460> the<00:02:07.580> middle

00:02:07.900 --> 00:02:07.910 
delivery is triggered by the middle

00:02:07.910 --> 00:02:12.070 
delivery is triggered by the middle
finger<00:02:09.310> the<00:02:10.310> reason<00:02:11.060> that<00:02:11.239> it<00:02:11.420> is<00:02:11.540> separate

00:02:12.070 --> 00:02:12.080 
finger the reason that it is separate

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:14.350 
finger the reason that it is separate
from<00:02:12.290> the<00:02:12.500> ignition<00:02:12.800> part<00:02:13.310> is<00:02:13.520> because<00:02:14.209> the

00:02:14.350 --> 00:02:14.360 
from the ignition part is because the

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:16.330 
from the ignition part is because the
lighter<00:02:14.570> doesn't<00:02:14.840> light<00:02:15.140> every<00:02:15.440> time<00:02:15.680> if<00:02:15.950> it

00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:16.340 
lighter doesn't light every time if it

00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:18.280 
lighter doesn't light every time if it
was<00:02:16.370> a<00:02:16.459> hundred<00:02:16.820> percent<00:02:16.850> I<00:02:17.420> just<00:02:17.930> have<00:02:18.110> the

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:18.290 
was a hundred percent I just have the

00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:20.320 
was a hundred percent I just have the
switch<00:02:18.560> since<00:02:19.310> when<00:02:19.610> the<00:02:19.640> barbecue<00:02:20.120> lighter

00:02:20.320 --> 00:02:20.330 
switch since when the barbecue lighter

00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:23.800 
switch since when the barbecue lighter
was<00:02:20.800> in<00:02:21.800> the<00:02:21.980> back<00:02:22.190> position<00:02:22.430> but<00:02:23.360> doesn't

00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:23.810 
was in the back position but doesn't

00:02:23.810 --> 00:02:25.030
