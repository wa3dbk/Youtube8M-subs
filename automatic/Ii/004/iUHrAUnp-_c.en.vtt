like<00:01:46.770> imagine<00:01:47.250> a<00:01:47.399> full<00:01:47.850> 30<00:01:48.210> player<00:01:48.509> off-road

00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:49.020 
like imagine a full 30 player off-road

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:51.440 
like imagine a full 30 player off-road
race<00:01:49.259> where<00:01:49.530> everyone's<00:01:50.009> in<00:01:50.220> these<00:01:50.450> coil

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:51.450 
race where everyone's in these coil

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:53.179 
race where everyone's in these coil
brawls<00:01:51.810> that<00:01:52.110> would<00:01:52.259> just<00:01:52.380> be<00:01:52.500> insane<00:01:52.950> that

00:01:53.179 --> 00:01:53.189 
brawls that would just be insane that

00:01:53.189 --> 00:01:54.980 
brawls that would just be insane that
would<00:01:53.280> be<00:01:53.399> so<00:01:53.610> much<00:01:53.759> fun<00:01:53.820> I<00:01:54.240> might<00:01:54.810> actually

00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:54.990 
would be so much fun I might actually

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:56.440 
would be so much fun I might actually
have<00:01:55.140> to<00:01:55.290> do<00:01:55.439> that<00:01:55.619> layer<00:01:55.829> on<00:01:55.979> one<00:01:56.189> of<00:01:56.250> my

have to do that layer on one of my
off-road<00:01:57.450> tracks<00:01:57.750> which<00:01:57.960> would<00:01:58.140> be

00:01:58.249 --> 00:01:58.259 
off-road tracks which would be

00:01:58.259 --> 00:02:00.590 
off-road tracks which would be
absolutely<00:01:58.619> insane<00:01:58.860> anyway<00:01:59.579> I<00:01:59.759> said<00:02:00.420> but

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:00.600

00:02:23.849 --> 00:02:23.859 
like I think this thing I think this one

like I think this thing I think this one
looks<00:02:23.889> a<00:02:24.129> little<00:02:24.159> more<00:02:24.519> clean<00:02:24.730> that<00:02:24.879> one<00:02:24.969> just

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:25.180 
looks a little more clean that one just

00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:26.610 
looks a little more clean that one just
looks<00:02:25.269> identical<00:02:25.989> to<00:02:26.019> what<00:02:26.200> you<00:02:26.230> get<00:02:26.469> on<00:02:26.590> the

00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:26.620 
looks identical to what you get on the

00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:28.440 
looks identical to what you get on the
dub<00:02:26.920> stir<00:02:27.159> so<00:02:27.700> we're<00:02:27.879> gonna<00:02:27.969> go<00:02:28.150> for<00:02:28.299> this<00:02:28.389> one

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:28.450 
dub stir so we're gonna go for this one

00:02:28.450 --> 00:02:31.229 
dub stir so we're gonna go for this one
for<00:02:28.749> now<00:02:28.930> and<00:02:29.310> then<00:02:30.310> for<00:02:30.519> the<00:02:30.639> bump<00:02:30.879> about<00:02:31.090> oh

00:02:31.229 --> 00:02:31.239 
for now and then for the bump about oh

00:02:31.239 --> 00:02:33.479 
for now and then for the bump about oh
we<00:02:31.480> can<00:02:31.629> get<00:02:31.750> the<00:02:31.959> spare<00:02:32.290> wheel<00:02:32.560> few<00:02:33.219> of<00:02:33.370> the

00:02:33.479 --> 00:02:33.489 
we can get the spare wheel few of the

00:02:33.489 --> 00:02:35.550 
we can get the spare wheel few of the
spare<00:02:33.730> wheel<00:02:33.939> I'm<00:02:34.599> not<00:02:34.870> feeling<00:02:35.139> this<00:02:35.200> bad<00:02:35.379> way

00:02:35.550 --> 00:02:35.560 
spare wheel I'm not feeling this bad way

00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:36.899 
spare wheel I'm not feeling this bad way
I<00:02:35.590> think<00:02:35.829> you<00:02:36.010> know<00:02:36.129> this<00:02:36.370> thing<00:02:36.609> looks<00:02:36.819> a<00:02:36.879> bit

00:02:36.899 --> 00:02:36.909 
I think you know this thing looks a bit

00:02:36.909 --> 00:02:40.050 
I think you know this thing looks a bit
more<00:02:37.180> cleaner<00:02:38.400> rollcage<00:02:39.400> obviously<00:02:39.939> we've

00:02:40.050 --> 00:02:40.060 
more cleaner rollcage obviously we've

00:02:40.060 --> 00:02:41.550 
more cleaner rollcage obviously we've
got<00:02:40.090> to<00:02:40.239> get<00:02:40.329> a<00:02:40.359> roll<00:02:40.599> cage<00:02:40.840> in<00:02:40.989> this<00:02:41.139> thing

00:02:41.550 --> 00:02:41.560 
got to get a roll cage in this thing

00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:43.349 
got to get a roll cage in this thing
we'll<00:02:41.980> get<00:02:42.099> the<00:02:42.219> engine<00:02:42.609> upgrade<00:02:42.969> we'll<00:02:43.209> leave

00:02:43.349 --> 00:02:43.359 
we'll get the engine upgrade we'll leave

00:02:43.359 --> 00:02:46.050 
we'll get the engine upgrade we'll leave
a<00:02:43.389> harness<00:02:43.629> to<00:02:43.780> fillet<00:02:44.109> er<00:02:44.349> headlights<00:02:45.219> a<00:02:45.519> neon

00:02:46.050 --> 00:02:46.060 
a harness to fillet er headlights a neon

00:02:46.060 --> 00:02:48.270 
a harness to fillet er headlights a neon
light<00:02:46.090> just<00:02:46.780> for<00:02:46.900> why<00:02:47.260> not<00:02:47.500> we'll<00:02:47.680> decide<00:02:48.010> on<00:02:48.189> a

00:02:48.270 --> 00:02:48.280 
light just for why not we'll decide on a

00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:49.979 
light just for why not we'll decide on a
color<00:02:48.459> in<00:02:49.359> a<00:02:49.450> second

00:02:49.979 --> 00:02:49.989 
color in a second

00:02:49.989 --> 00:02:53.059 
color in a second
did<00:02:50.530> the<00:02:50.650> do<00:02:51.219> the<00:02:51.310> neon<00:02:51.579> kits<00:02:51.819> even<00:02:52.120> show<00:02:52.419> oh

00:02:53.059 --> 00:02:53.069 
did the do the neon kits even show oh

00:02:53.069 --> 00:02:55.319 
did the do the neon kits even show oh
you<00:02:54.069> can<00:02:54.219> barely<00:02:54.489> see<00:02:54.819> him<00:02:54.909> just<00:02:55.030> cause<00:02:55.180> the

00:02:55.319 --> 00:02:55.329 
you can barely see him just cause the

00:02:55.329 --> 00:02:56.939 
you can barely see him just cause the
things<00:02:55.569> so<00:02:55.810> high<00:02:56.019> or<00:02:56.230> that's<00:02:56.439> crazy

00:02:56.939 --> 00:02:56.949 
things so high or that's crazy

00:02:56.949 --> 00:02:59.099 
things so high or that's crazy
might<00:02:57.430> have<00:02:57.549> to<00:02:57.730> lower<00:02:57.969> it<00:02:58.090> so<00:02:58.359> we<00:02:58.569> get<00:02:58.719> the<00:02:58.900> bit

00:02:59.099 --> 00:02:59.109 
might have to lower it so we get the bit

00:02:59.109 --> 00:03:01.280 
might have to lower it so we get the bit
more<00:02:59.290> for<00:02:59.500> the<00:02:59.560> effects<00:03:00.069> on<00:03:00.189> the<00:03:00.639> actual<00:03:00.879> neons

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:01.290 
more for the effects on the actual neons

00:03:01.290 --> 00:03:04.379 
more for the effects on the actual neons
so<00:03:02.290> we<00:03:02.409> could<00:03:02.680> go<00:03:02.889> for<00:03:03.219> like<00:03:03.459> a<00:03:03.819> really<00:03:04.239> nice

00:03:04.379 --> 00:03:04.389 
so we could go for like a really nice

00:03:04.389 --> 00:03:06.629 
so we could go for like a really nice
matte<00:03:04.780> black<00:03:05.049> I'd<00:03:05.379> stay<00:03:05.829> away<00:03:05.859> from<00:03:06.099> that

00:03:06.629 --> 00:03:06.639

the race transmission we put the turbo
on<00:04:33.220> it<00:04:33.460> and<00:04:33.670> then<00:04:34.600> we'll<00:04:34.720> go<00:04:34.840> down<00:04:35.050> to<00:04:35.200> the

on it and then we'll go down to the
wheel<00:04:35.440> so<00:04:35.680> obviously<00:04:36.100> we're<00:04:36.820> gonna<00:04:36.910> want<00:04:37.270> some

00:04:45.950 --> 00:04:45.960 
but I don't know what we watch we go for

00:04:45.960 --> 00:04:50.160 
but I don't know what we watch we go for
I<00:04:46.960> think<00:04:47.320> I<00:04:47.530> think<00:04:47.800> that's<00:04:47.950> quite<00:04:48.490> nice<00:04:49.140> may<00:04:50.140> I

00:04:50.160 --> 00:04:50.170 
I think I think that's quite nice may I

00:04:50.170 --> 00:04:52.470 
I think I think that's quite nice may I
know<00:04:50.440> just<00:04:50.680> simplistic<00:04:51.400> I<00:04:51.520> mean<00:04:51.730> even<00:04:52.030> even

00:04:52.470 --> 00:04:52.480 
know just simplistic I mean even even

00:04:52.480 --> 00:04:53.700 
know just simplistic I mean even even
something<00:04:52.720> like<00:04:52.810> this<00:04:52.930> a<00:04:52.990> simplistic<00:04:53.590> design

00:04:53.700 --> 00:04:53.710 
something like this a simplistic design

00:04:53.710 --> 00:04:56.940 
something like this a simplistic design
and<00:04:54.190> then<00:04:54.670> we'll<00:04:54.850> just<00:04:55.260> get<00:04:56.260> the<00:04:56.380> colour<00:04:56.650> and

00:04:56.940 --> 00:04:56.950 
and then we'll just get the colour and

00:04:56.950 --> 00:04:58.410 
and then we'll just get the colour and
then<00:04:57.070> I'll<00:04:57.130> black<00:04:57.370> them<00:04:57.550> out<00:04:57.670> just<00:04:58.000> so<00:04:58.150> you

00:04:58.410 --> 00:04:58.420 
then I'll black them out just so you

00:04:58.420 --> 00:05:00.960 
then I'll black them out just so you
can't<00:04:58.810> really<00:04:58.990> notice<00:04:59.230> them<00:04:59.500> too<00:04:59.710> much<00:04:59.970> but

00:05:00.960 --> 00:05:00.970 
can't really notice them too much but

00:05:00.970 --> 00:05:03.150 
can't really notice them too much but
obviously<00:05:01.360> is<00:05:01.600> that<00:05:01.870> the<00:05:02.320> off-road<00:05:02.710> kind<00:05:03.040> of

00:05:03.150 --> 00:05:03.160 
obviously is that the off-road kind of

00:05:03.160 --> 00:05:05.010 
obviously is that the off-road kind of
style<00:05:03.430> of<00:05:03.610> wheels<00:05:03.820> and<00:05:04.180> then<00:05:04.510> I<00:05:04.600> think<00:05:04.810> this

00:05:05.010 --> 00:05:05.020 
style of wheels and then I think this

00:05:05.020 --> 00:05:07.350 
style of wheels and then I think this
will<00:05:05.140> finish<00:05:05.380> off<00:05:05.650> with<00:05:06.550> the<00:05:06.820> tinted<00:05:07.270> windows

00:05:07.350 --> 00:05:07.360 
will finish off with the tinted windows

00:05:07.360 --> 00:05:10.080 
will finish off with the tinted windows
and<00:05:07.960> there<00:05:08.290> we<00:05:08.440> go<00:05:08.740> there's<00:05:09.400> our<00:05:09.610> fully

00:05:10.080 --> 00:05:10.090 
and there we go there's our fully

00:05:10.090 --> 00:05:13.080 
and there we go there's our fully
upgraded<00:05:10.750> rally<00:05:11.050> fighter<00:05:11.440> slash<00:05:12.070> coil<00:05:12.820> brawl

00:05:13.080 --> 00:05:13.090 
upgraded rally fighter slash coil brawl

00:05:13.090 --> 00:05:16.350 
upgraded rally fighter slash coil brawl
