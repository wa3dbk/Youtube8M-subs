00:00:46.459 --> 00:00:46.469 
be playing as Simon ghost Reilly so it

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:48.139 
be playing as Simon ghost Reilly so it
doesn't<00:00:46.800> seem<00:00:47.039> that<00:00:47.070> unique<00:00:47.670> it<00:00:47.820> doesn't<00:00:48.030> seem

00:00:48.139 --> 00:00:48.149 
doesn't seem that unique it doesn't seem

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:49.729 
doesn't seem that unique it doesn't seem
that<00:00:48.180> special<00:00:48.840> they<00:00:49.289> really<00:00:49.590> should<00:00:49.710> have

00:00:49.729 --> 00:00:49.739 
that special they really should have

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:51.950

made<00:00:49.950> this<00:00:50.100> a<00:00:50.160> tougher<00:00:50.789> thing<00:00:51.149> to<00:00:51.329> achieve<00:00:51.449> I

00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:51.960 
made this a tougher thing to achieve I

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:53.240 
made this a tougher thing to achieve I
don't<00:00:52.110> think<00:00:52.379> they<00:00:52.500> should<00:00:52.680> just<00:00:52.710> hand<00:00:53.039> it<00:00:53.160> out

00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:53.250 
don't think they should just hand it out

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:54.529 
don't think they should just hand it out
and<00:00:53.399> say<00:00:53.520> here<00:00:53.670> you<00:00:53.730> go<00:00:53.910> through<00:00:54.210> period<00:00:54.480> of
