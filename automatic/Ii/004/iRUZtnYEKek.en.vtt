 And of course I have your cables running 

00:03:19.810 --> 00:03:27.160
 commanded her to appreciate after a computer 

00:03:25.060 --> 00:03:28.570
 to record it I will just take the computer 

00:03:27.160 --> 00:03:30.430
 from the inside you all like that 

00:03:28.570 --> 00:03:34.030
 find the inside interesting here 

00:03:30.430 --> 00:03:36.730
 My computer will bring is 

00:03:34.030 --> 00:03:39.300
 vision it en makes me crazy you 

00:03:36.730 --> 00:03:42.550
 think nicely says rolsma established 

00:03:39.300 --> 00:03:43.360
 that's a little bit already falling 

00:03:42.550 --> 00:03:45.700
 actually with it 

00:03:43.360 --> 00:03:48.820
 broken phone it yes i can too 

00:03:45.700 --> 00:03:51.010
 just use it so yes I don't have one 

00:03:48.820 --> 00:03:53.880
 Only problem cases agree 

00:03:51.010 --> 00:03:56.500
 only one is not insured you have that too 

00:03:53.880 --> 00:04:00.160
 my playstation controller always me 

00:03:56.500 --> 00:04:02.680
 scroll a little bit more in circle 

00:04:00.160 --> 00:04:05.470
 weight free what over here I want 

00:04:02.680 --> 00:04:08.130
 of course had to control the chrome 

00:04:05.470 --> 00:04:10.989
 demand control with the black train from 

00:04:08.130 --> 00:04:12.190
 batteries because yes I was one of the 

00:04:10.989 --> 00:04:13.930
 first youtube 

00:04:12.190 --> 00:04:15.280
 the bulls so I always played master 

00:04:13.930 --> 00:04:17.019
 with the white on a black and I came 

00:04:15.280 --> 00:04:20.410
 this the store I think it is short 

00:04:17.019 --> 00:04:22.390
 because if you just have asia ripples that 

00:04:20.410 --> 00:04:23.890
 about going places all 

00:04:22.390 --> 00:04:27.040
 four choices and that is of course a lot 

00:04:23.890 --> 00:04:29.650
 finer yeah I think about Peter and Aeltie 

00:04:27.040 --> 00:04:31.210
 creativity just a bit better and buttons 

00:04:29.650 --> 00:04:33.820
 find something better that stay 

00:04:31.210 --> 00:04:36.370
 paste in and redder this from ctrl or 

00:04:33.820 --> 00:04:38.350
 in I improve and what I do 

00:04:36.370 --> 00:04:40.240
 Of course you also need is just a 

00:04:38.350 --> 00:04:42.370
 yes where i record everything and then i go 

00:04:40.240 --> 00:04:45.970
 well again as we see here one 

00:04:42.370 --> 00:04:48.580
 standard logitec keyboard 

00:04:45.970 --> 00:04:51.910

00:04:48.580 --> 00:04:53.200
 mouse also some blocks physically focus on 

00:04:51.910 --> 00:04:53.550

00:04:58.690 --> 00:05:04.800
