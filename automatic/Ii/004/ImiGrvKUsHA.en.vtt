never<00:01:42.240> seen<00:01:42.360> a<00:01:42.540> player<00:01:42.899> go<00:01:43.590> from<00:01:43.829> 56<00:01:44.520> to<00:01:44.729> our<00:01:45.530> 75

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:46.530 
never seen a player go from 56 to our 75

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:48.740 
never seen a player go from 56 to our 75
look<00:01:46.740> at<00:01:46.890> look<00:01:47.070> at<00:01:47.189> the<00:01:47.280> determination<00:01:47.570> on<00:01:48.570> his

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:48.750 
look at look at the determination on his

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:51.499 
look at look at the determination on his
face<00:01:49.020> linsanity<00:01:49.829> they<00:01:50.729> still<00:01:51.000> don't<00:01:51.090> have<00:01:51.329> the

00:01:51.499 --> 00:01:51.509 
face linsanity they still don't have the

00:01:51.509 --> 00:01:54.499 
face linsanity they still don't have the
sleeves<00:01:51.869> on<00:01:52.170> his<00:01:52.439> legs<00:01:52.770> but<00:01:53.579> let's<00:01:54.210> go<00:01:54.479> ahead

00:01:54.499 --> 00:01:54.509 
sleeves on his legs but let's go ahead

00:01:54.509 --> 00:02:06.560 
sleeves on his legs but let's go ahead
and<00:01:54.810> check<00:01:55.259> out<00:01:55.790> some<00:01:56.790> of<00:01:56.820> his<00:01:57.060> ratings

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:06.570 

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:11.440 

so<00:02:07.170> he<00:02:07.440> is<00:02:07.620> 75<00:02:08.369> inside<00:02:09.090> 79<00:02:09.840> but<00:02:10.140> let's<00:02:10.380> take<00:02:10.590> a

00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:11.450 
so he is 75 inside 79 but let's take a

00:02:11.450 --> 00:02:14.270 
so he is 75 inside 79 but let's take a
take<00:02:12.450> a<00:02:12.480> closer<00:02:12.870> look<00:02:13.020> at<00:02:13.350> the<00:02:13.530> graph<00:02:13.860> his

00:02:14.270 --> 00:02:14.280 
take a closer look at the graph his

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:16.730 
take a closer look at the graph his
graph<00:02:14.700> actually<00:02:15.300> is<00:02:15.390> an<00:02:15.450> attribute<00:02:15.740> so

00:02:16.730 --> 00:02:16.740 
graph actually is an attribute so

00:02:16.740 --> 00:02:19.760 
graph actually is an attribute so
overall<00:02:17.280> position<00:02:18.150> overall<00:02:18.660> 77<00:02:19.350> rating<00:02:19.650> is

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:19.770 
overall position overall 77 rating is

00:02:19.770 --> 00:02:24.980 
overall position overall 77 rating is
