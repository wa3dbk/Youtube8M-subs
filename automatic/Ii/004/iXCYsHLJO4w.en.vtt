00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.470
 so I'm doing my second part of my 

00:00:02.790 --> 00:00:06.509
 finished products because I have 

00:00:04.470 --> 00:00:08.220
 finished too much to do it in part 

00:00:06.509 --> 00:00:09.840
 because as I start I wanted 

00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:12.210
 really finish the most points 

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:15.330
 possible then we are for the nozzle 

00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:18.779
 mgk if his shampoos and dr barret sense 

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:20.070
 of the naked range so that's the one of 

00:00:18.779 --> 00:00:21.720
 shampoo volumes extracted from 

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:23.550
 white grapefruit and watches that is 

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:26.849
 personally i would love the smell 

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:29.490

00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:33.120
 tribute and 6 no I really like it 

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:34.320

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:37.530
 were using then he's really amused 

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:40.890
 and the other shampoo that I finished it's 

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:43.290
 that of matrix biolage hydrotherapy 

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:44.489
 it really makes me think outside of 

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:47.850
 at at Russian headdress because my 

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:49.079
 trust I used it on me there you 

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:50.610
 you're going to eat over a lot of 

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:52.829
 shampoo but it's just past 

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:56.070
 wait all starts and I know just 

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:58.320
 everything ends so yes it's very moisturizing 

00:00:56.070 --> 00:00:59.820
 I really liked it really 

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:01.230
 I love the smell if it really does 

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:05.010
 like at the hairdressing salon 

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:07.650
 so I bound the bulky shampoos 

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:09.360
 at lush so just on the test has 

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:11.430
 recently talked about a form in something 

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:14.909
 of phew but really really great 

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:16.770
 and as in Quebec it's this crisis 

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:18.659
 it's my reality lemon juice and the 

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:21.090
 transform masters I love you in one 

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:22.710
 head and fatigue full of volume make a 

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:24.630
 shampoo and stay so that's how 

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:26.640
 a texture like as an experience 

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:28.530
 and you really feel the style 

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:30.900
 so not so much the seriousness it is 

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:32.790
 magical i like the smell so much on a 

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:34.560
 100% I would like chichon for the book 

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:36.960
 really really if I finished another 

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:38.700
 shampoo and wii is the rotation of the 

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:41.189
 same frozen range can finish a little bit 

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:44.600
 but that's the recognize the blondes 

00:01:41.189 --> 00:01:48.899

 handball and a good bowl this is the 

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:08.459
 surf range so it smells great 

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:10.349
 says it's for sweet hair and 

00:02:08.459 --> 00:02:11.160
 tuning in the wind little movement 

00:02:10.349 --> 00:02:13.410
 so 

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:15.510
 I loved the poor and are really 

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:17.370
 great when I knew I was not going 

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:18.780
 but it's among the Russians did like 

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:20.760

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:22.560

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:24.150

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:29.220
 finished an exfoliator to adjust them the 

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:30.870
 last scrub to abrasives ready 

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:32.760
 doubtful origins 

00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:34.800
 sincerely it's the tube it's really 

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:36.420
 really really great for anyone 

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:39.030
 who has the sensitive skin up to date 

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:41.640

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:45.180
 exfoliating the very sweet really created 

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:49.860
 eat better than that he's really going 

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:51.480
 alright but I would buy them but I 

00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:53.430
 recently received the ocean floor of 

00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:54.900
 lodge then I really liked it 

00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:56.610
 less like those who find that 

00:02:54.900 --> 00:02:59.940
 it was a little too abrasive a 

00:02:56.610 --> 00:03:01.500
 times like the 13 % in that of the egg 

00:02:59.940 --> 00:03:03.000
 or whoever wants to 

00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:04.170
 really something to lose there or because 

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:05.940
 that very sensitive skin I you 

00:03:04.170 --> 00:03:07.380
 really recommend this one then you 

00:03:05.940 --> 00:03:09.000
 can find it at sephora sa 

00:03:07.380 --> 00:03:11.510

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:13.710

00:03:24.180 --> 00:03:28.980
 good and said himself great without being 

00:03:27.690 --> 00:03:31.050
 too abrasive 

00:03:28.980 --> 00:03:33.180
 I recommend myself on seals 

00:03:31.050 --> 00:03:36.030
 it's true we all had once 

00:03:33.180 --> 00:03:37.230

00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:42.239
 order and soon we also finished a 

00:03:39.780 --> 00:03:44.790
 small sample of shampoo volume 2 

00:03:42.239 --> 00:03:46.980

00:03:44.790 --> 00:03:47.459

 for the ages of the big and means and 

00:03:57.780 --> 00:04:01.260
 now it's more at home 

00:03:58.950 --> 00:04:06.030
 parents I see it more than that the winners 

00:04:01.260 --> 00:04:07.440
 even though these Canadians with the de 

00:04:06.030 --> 00:04:10.110
 maple so it's a cleanser 

00:04:07.440 --> 00:04:12.000
 technique it is salicylic acid from 

00:04:10.110 --> 00:04:13.500
 2% medicated solution for 

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:14.940
 treating acne treatment in its 

00:04:13.500 --> 00:04:16.380
 hypers blick and blue it's really 

00:04:14.940 --> 00:04:18.120
 liquids and that's not something 

00:04:16.380 --> 00:04:20.910
 that I could use with my skull 

00:04:18.120 --> 00:04:22.680
 and choose as two bridges then I 

00:04:20.910 --> 00:04:23.200
 massicois on my face felt after 

00:04:22.680 --> 00:04:24.190

00:04:26.770 --> 00:04:30.160
 texture be really liquid 

00:04:28.180 --> 00:04:31.870
 I finished a mask of people so 

00:04:30.160 --> 00:04:34.450
 it is this one it is a hair care 

00:04:31.870 --> 00:04:36.520
 restructuring more join the suitcases 

00:04:34.450 --> 00:04:38.320
 in depth the damaged hair so and 

00:04:36.520 --> 00:04:40.440
 like that there is the beautiful brown and the for 

00:04:38.320 --> 00:04:44.050
 bages the belgian pot success the smell is 

00:04:40.440 --> 00:04:45.880
 in the air then this one is like 

00:04:44.050 --> 00:04:47.890
 the original their personally no 

00:04:45.880 --> 00:04:50.800
 both men bother me or other 

00:04:47.890 --> 00:04:52.780
 it's the reverse then and it's like that 

00:04:50.800 --> 00:04:54.090
 since you take your hands fucking mass 

00:04:52.780 --> 00:04:56.560

00:04:54.090 --> 00:04:57.730
 wow i apply them on my hair 

00:04:56.560 --> 00:04:58.990
 then I remembered how much I 

00:04:57.730 --> 00:05:00.910
 loved that continues I did not buy 

00:04:58.990 --> 00:05:03.490
 a backup when I left this forum 

00:05:00.910 --> 00:05:06.610

 this terrible and I really feel where 

00:05:12.250 --> 00:05:14.890
 after I really advise those 

00:05:13.870 --> 00:05:16.270
 who have damaged hair 

00:05:14.890 --> 00:05:18.310

00:05:23.380 --> 00:05:30.100

00:05:41.140 --> 00:05:44.680
 as such so you took a piece 

00:05:42.610 --> 00:05:47.590

00:05:44.680 --> 00:05:49.990
 blue foam is so relaxing 

00:05:47.590 --> 00:05:52.330

00:05:52.330 --> 00:05:57.100

 the action the foam of this show that holds 

00:06:00.640 --> 00:06:03.940
 a little less time in vain that 

00:06:02.260 --> 00:06:06.610
 foam is not a song that you 

00:06:03.940 --> 00:06:09.250

00:06:06.610 --> 00:06:11.800
