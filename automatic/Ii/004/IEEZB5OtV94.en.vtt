what's your approach well you know
that's<00:03:51.689> a<00:03:51.780> great<00:03:51.900> question<00:03:52.019> my<00:03:52.620> approach<00:03:53.040> is

00:03:53.330 --> 00:03:53.340 
that's a great question my approach is

00:03:53.340 --> 00:03:55.759 
that's a great question my approach is
that<00:03:53.370> I<00:03:53.819> have<00:03:54.389> to<00:03:54.599> remind<00:03:54.989> him<00:03:55.260> that<00:03:55.500> he's<00:03:55.650> on

00:03:55.759 --> 00:03:55.769 
that I have to remind him that he's on

00:03:55.769 --> 00:03:58.069 
that I have to remind him that he's on
common<00:03:56.250> ground<00:03:56.519> he's<00:03:57.239> probably<00:03:57.480> gonna<00:03:57.720> think

00:03:58.069 --> 00:03:58.079 
common ground he's probably gonna think

00:03:58.079 --> 00:03:59.569 
common ground he's probably gonna think
he's<00:03:58.169> in<00:03:58.349> a<00:03:58.470> place<00:03:58.769> where<00:03:59.040> he's<00:03:59.159> never<00:03:59.310> been

00:03:59.569 --> 00:03:59.579 
he's in a place where he's never been

00:03:59.579 --> 00:04:02.149 
he's in a place where he's never been
before<00:03:59.819> but<00:04:00.269> hoping<00:04:00.540> we<00:04:00.659> might<00:04:00.810> hate<00:04:01.109> you<00:04:01.980> got

00:04:02.149 --> 00:04:02.159 
before but hoping we might hate you got

00:04:02.159 --> 00:04:03.860 
before but hoping we might hate you got
