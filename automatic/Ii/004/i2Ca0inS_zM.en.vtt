00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:18.930 
it that was my previous sim when I was

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:20.960 
it that was my previous sim when I was
using<00:02:19.170> it<00:02:19.410> on<00:02:19.590> go<00:02:19.950> phone<00:02:20.250> this<00:02:20.520> is<00:02:20.670> actually

00:02:20.960 --> 00:02:20.970 
using it on go phone this is actually

00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:23.840 
using it on go phone this is actually
that's<00:02:21.090> actually<00:02:21.300> a<00:02:21.600> gophone<00:02:22.140> sim<00:02:22.200> card<00:02:22.850> but

00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:23.850 
that's actually a gophone sim card but

00:02:23.850 --> 00:02:25.400 
that's actually a gophone sim card but
then<00:02:24.000> I<00:02:24.030> decided<00:02:24.420> to<00:02:24.720> switch<00:02:24.960> to<00:02:25.200> t-mobile

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:25.410 
then I decided to switch to t-mobile

00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:41.450 
then I decided to switch to t-mobile
since<00:02:25.950> its<00:02:26.160> way<00:02:26.640> better<00:02:29.540> okay

00:02:41.450 --> 00:02:41.460 

00:02:41.460 --> 00:02:43.820 

go<00:02:42.270> ahead<00:02:42.420> and<00:02:42.540> wait<00:02:42.630> for<00:02:42.870> it<00:02:42.960> to<00:02:43.230> bring<00:02:43.710> the

00:02:43.820 --> 00:02:43.830 
go ahead and wait for it to bring the

00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:48.860 
go ahead and wait for it to bring the
signal<00:02:44.250> bars<00:02:44.370> up<00:02:46.730> there<00:02:47.730> you<00:02:47.880> go<00:02:48.030> so<00:02:48.690> you<00:02:48.750> can

00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:48.870 
signal bars up there you go so you can

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:50.270 
signal bars up there you go so you can
see<00:02:49.080> I<00:02:49.110> don't<00:02:49.350> really<00:02:49.680> have<00:02:49.800> good<00:02:50.100> reception

00:02:50.270 --> 00:02:50.280 
see I don't really have good reception

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:53.090 
see I don't really have good reception
where<00:02:50.850> i<00:02:50.910> live<00:02:51.240> and<00:02:51.480> that's<00:02:52.290> also<00:02:52.470> the<00:02:52.980> main

00:02:53.090 --> 00:02:53.100 
where i live and that's also the main

00:02:53.100 --> 00:02:56.270 
where i live and that's also the main
reason<00:02:53.490> why<00:02:53.610> i<00:02:53.640> switched<00:02:53.910> to<00:02:54.180> t-mobile<00:02:55.280> okay

00:02:56.270 --> 00:02:56.280 
reason why i switched to t-mobile okay

00:02:56.280 --> 00:02:58.970 
reason why i switched to t-mobile okay
yeah<00:02:56.550> so<00:02:56.940> that<00:02:57.630> is<00:02:58.020> just<00:02:58.110> going<00:02:58.590> to<00:02:58.650> be<00:02:58.710> my

00:02:58.970 --> 00:02:58.980 
yeah so that is just going to be my

00:02:58.980 --> 00:03:00.230 
yeah so that is just going to be my
review<00:02:59.400> i'm<00:02:59.640> not<00:02:59.760> going<00:02:59.880> to<00:02:59.940> be<00:03:00.060> reviewing
