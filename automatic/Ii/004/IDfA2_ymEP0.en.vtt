simple<00:02:11.739> and<00:02:12.129> easy<00:02:12.519> so<00:02:13.419> there<00:02:14.109> go<00:02:14.290> this<00:02:14.590> is<00:02:14.799> a

00:02:14.819 --> 00:02:14.829 
simple and easy so there go this is a

00:02:14.829 --> 00:02:17.069 
simple and easy so there go this is a
white<00:02:15.129> colored<00:02:15.489> model<00:02:15.819> it<00:02:16.209> feels<00:02:16.510> slightly

00:02:17.069 --> 00:02:17.079 
white colored model it feels slightly

00:02:17.079 --> 00:02:18.559 
white colored model it feels slightly
larger<00:02:17.620> than<00:02:17.650> its<00:02:18.010> predecessor

00:02:18.559 --> 00:02:18.569 
larger than its predecessor

00:02:18.569 --> 00:02:21.289 
larger than its predecessor
so<00:02:18.689> as<00:02:18.870> you<00:02:18.900> can<00:02:19.140> see<00:02:19.379> and<00:02:19.879> here<00:02:20.879> are<00:02:20.939> the<00:02:20.999> same

00:02:55.129 --> 00:02:55.139 
and brothers alright this is also the

00:02:55.139 --> 00:02:58.339 
and brothers alright this is also the
zenfone<00:02:55.590> 5<00:02:55.889> has<00:02:56.129> m5h<00:02:56.939> display<00:02:57.419> rest<00:02:58.079> the

00:02:58.339 --> 00:02:58.349 
zenfone 5 has m5h display rest the

00:02:58.349 --> 00:03:01.339 
zenfone 5 has m5h display rest the
sample<00:02:58.769> for<00:02:59.069> the<00:02:59.280> new<00:02:59.519> one<00:02:59.760> has<00:02:59.939> a<00:03:00.000> 4.5<00:03:00.840> inch

00:03:01.339 --> 00:03:01.349 
sample for the new one has a 4.5 inch

00:03:01.349 --> 00:03:04.099 
sample for the new one has a 4.5 inch
display<00:03:01.799> so<00:03:02.400> they<00:03:02.730> are<00:03:02.790> pretty<00:03:02.969> much<00:03:03.209> that's<00:03:03.930> a

00:03:04.099 --> 00:03:04.109 
display so they are pretty much that's a

00:03:04.109 --> 00:03:06.259 
display so they are pretty much that's a
big<00:03:04.319> difference<00:03:04.439> in<00:03:04.859> terms<00:03:05.219> of<00:03:05.430> size<00:03:05.819> so<00:03:06.060> let's

00:03:06.259 --> 00:03:06.269 
big difference in terms of size so let's

00:03:06.269 --> 00:03:09.080 
big difference in terms of size so let's
put<00:03:06.480> the<00:03:06.629> zip<00:03:06.959> of<00:03:07.230> five<00:03:07.590> away<00:03:08.370> ahead<00:03:08.489> in<00:03:08.849> terms

00:03:09.080 --> 00:03:09.090 
put the zip of five away ahead in terms

00:03:09.090 --> 00:03:12.559 
put the zip of five away ahead in terms
of<00:03:09.239> thickness<00:03:09.659> yeah<00:03:10.379> is<00:03:11.060> no<00:03:12.060> the<00:03:12.329> zenfone

00:03:12.559 --> 00:03:12.569 
of thickness yeah is no the zenfone

00:03:12.569 --> 00:03:15.349 
of thickness yeah is no the zenfone
virus<00:03:12.989> is<00:03:13.079> actually<00:03:13.349> a<00:03:13.379> slimmer<00:03:13.650> so<00:03:14.579> let's<00:03:15.209> put

00:03:15.349 --> 00:03:15.359 
virus is actually a slimmer so let's put

00:03:15.359 --> 00:03:18.140 
virus is actually a slimmer so let's put
the<00:03:15.449> sample<00:03:15.810> file<00:03:15.989> away<00:03:16.319> finally<00:03:16.620> and<00:03:17.150> let's

00:03:18.140 --> 00:03:18.150 
the sample file away finally and let's

00:03:18.150 --> 00:03:21.050 
the sample file away finally and let's
pop<00:03:18.659> the<00:03:18.959> back<00:03:19.199> cover<00:03:19.469> up<00:03:19.739> I<00:03:19.980> think<00:03:20.400> is<00:03:20.849> right

00:03:21.050 --> 00:03:21.060 
pop the back cover up I think is right

here pop back up then you go it comes up
very<00:03:27.299> easily<00:03:27.949> as<00:03:28.949> usual<00:03:29.519> I<00:03:29.959> don't<00:03:30.959> know<00:03:31.019> why

00:03:31.219 --> 00:03:31.229 
very easily as usual I don't know why

00:03:31.229 --> 00:03:33.140 
very easily as usual I don't know why
the<00:03:31.290> casing<00:03:31.769> is<00:03:31.799> always<00:03:32.250> so<00:03:32.459> hot<00:03:32.669> but<00:03:32.819> it's

00:03:33.140 --> 00:03:33.150

00:03:36.379 --> 00:03:36.389 
solid and I like it so this time the

00:03:36.389 --> 00:03:38.960 
solid and I like it so this time the
battery<00:03:36.870> is<00:03:37.049> non-removable<00:03:37.939> unlike<00:03:38.939> the
