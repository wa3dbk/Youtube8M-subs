00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:43.990 
of water twist into a two strand twist
and<00:01:35.060> then<00:01:35.420> create<00:01:35.899> the<00:01:36.140> bantu<00:01:36.560> knot<00:01:43.000> alright

00:01:43.990 --> 00:01:44.000

bantu knots on the non twisted - sure

00:02:50.960 --> 00:02:53.320 
bantu knots on the non twisted - sure
and<00:02:51.050> twisted<00:02:51.680> side<00:02:51.950> of<00:02:52.250> my<00:02:52.430> head<00:02:52.700> I<00:02:52.940> can<00:02:53.120> tell

00:02:53.320 --> 00:02:53.330 
and twisted side of my head I can tell

and twisted side of my head I can tell
that<00:02:53.360> the<00:02:53.690> bantu<00:02:54.260> knots<00:02:54.470> are<00:02:54.680> tighter<00:02:55.160> and

00:02:55.510 --> 00:02:55.520 
that the bantu knots are tighter and

00:02:55.520 --> 00:02:58.090 
that the bantu knots are tighter and
more<00:02:56.180> compact<00:02:56.810> like<00:02:57.110> closer<00:02:57.350> to<00:02:57.620> my<00:02:57.740> scalp

00:02:58.090 --> 00:02:58.100 
more compact like closer to my scalp

00:02:58.100 --> 00:03:01.300 
more compact like closer to my scalp
then<00:02:58.880> the<00:02:59.270> -<00:02:59.720> sure<00:02:59.930> and<00:03:00.050> twisted<00:03:00.530> bantu<00:03:00.860> knots

00:03:01.300 --> 00:03:01.310

00:03:01.310 --> 00:03:15.940 
then the - sure and twisted bantu knots
I<00:03:13.240> let<00:03:14.240> the<00:03:14.360> bantu<00:03:14.660> knot<00:03:14.870> set<00:03:15.200> overnight<00:03:15.530> and

00:03:15.940 --> 00:03:15.950 
I let the bantu knot set overnight and

00:03:15.950 --> 00:03:18.400 
I let the bantu knot set overnight and
I'm<00:03:16.490> just<00:03:16.760> going<00:03:16.970> to<00:03:17.030> remove<00:03:17.450> them<00:03:17.750> with<00:03:18.140> a

I'm just going to remove them with a

00:03:18.410 --> 00:03:19.900 
I'm just going to remove them with a
little<00:03:18.650> bit<00:03:18.770> of<00:03:18.860> coconut<00:03:19.100> oil<00:03:19.490> on<00:03:19.730> my<00:03:19.850> fingers

little bit of coconut oil on my fingers
the<00:03:28.210> two<00:03:29.210> Shran<00:03:29.540> twisted<00:03:30.200> bantu<00:03:31.160> knots<00:03:31.400> are

00:03:31.630 --> 00:03:31.640 
the two Shran twisted bantu knots are

00:03:31.640 --> 00:04:21.580 
the two Shran twisted bantu knots are
very<00:03:32.000> easy<00:03:32.270> to<00:03:32.480> unravel<00:03:33.260> and<00:03:33.440> separate

00:04:21.580 --> 00:04:21.590 

00:04:21.590 --> 00:04:26.090 

be<00:04:22.590> just<00:04:23.130> the<00:04:23.490> non<00:04:23.880> twisted<00:04:24.660> Bantu<00:04:25.140> nuts<00:04:25.380> are<00:04:25.710> a

be just the non twisted Bantu nuts are a

00:04:26.100 --> 00:04:28.580 
be just the non twisted Bantu nuts are a
little<00:04:26.370> bit<00:04:26.640> harder<00:04:27.450> to<00:04:27.480> unravel<00:04:28.290> and<00:04:28.440> they're

00:04:28.580 --> 00:04:28.590 
little bit harder to unravel and they're

00:04:28.590 --> 00:04:31.640 
little bit harder to unravel and they're
also<00:04:28.770> still<00:04:29.400> a<00:04:29.670> little<00:04:29.850> bit<00:04:30.120> damp<00:04:30.330> when<00:04:31.050> the<00:04:31.350> -

00:04:31.640 --> 00:04:31.650 
also still a little bit damp when the -

00:04:31.650 --> 00:04:33.380 
also still a little bit damp when the -
sure<00:04:31.860> and<00:04:31.920> twisted<00:04:32.460> bantu<00:04:32.880> knots<00:04:33.120> are

00:04:33.380 --> 00:04:33.390 
sure and twisted bantu knots are

00:04:33.390 --> 00:04:39.800 
sure and twisted bantu knots are
completely<00:04:34.020> dry<00:04:37.610> so<00:04:38.610> because<00:04:39.060> my<00:04:39.390> hair<00:04:39.780> is

00:04:39.800 --> 00:04:39.810 
completely dry so because my hair is
