lightweight<00:00:32.930> basically<00:00:33.930> we<00:00:34.050> took<00:00:34.199> all<00:00:34.440> those

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:34.680 
lightweight basically we took all those

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:37.790 
lightweight basically we took all those
aspects<00:00:35.219> and<00:00:35.699> we<00:00:35.910> filled<00:00:36.420> the<00:00:37.079> aerocart<00:00:37.559> kids

00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:37.800 
aspects and we filled the aerocart kids

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:40.069 
aspects and we filled the aerocart kids
but<00:00:38.249> we<00:00:38.370> wanted<00:00:38.579> to<00:00:38.640> also<00:00:38.819> to<00:00:39.030> offer<00:00:39.179> it<00:00:39.359> to<00:00:39.420> the

00:00:40.069 --> 00:00:40.079 
but we wanted to also to offer it to the

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:42.529 
but we wanted to also to offer it to the
consumer<00:00:40.559> to<00:00:40.589> the<00:00:40.800> user<00:00:41.489> to<00:00:41.789> age<00:00:41.940> grouper<00:00:42.390> and

00:00:50.809 --> 00:00:50.819 
built in Europe car and apply it to the

00:00:50.819 --> 00:00:53.599 
built in Europe car and apply it to the
collection<00:00:51.409> basically<00:00:52.409> across<00:00:52.799> we<00:00:53.370> build

00:00:53.599 --> 00:00:53.609 
collection basically across we build

00:00:53.609 --> 00:00:55.610 
collection basically across we build
that<00:00:53.909> collection<00:00:54.539> that's<00:00:54.989> called<00:00:55.229> a<00:00:55.350> Porsche

00:00:55.610 --> 00:00:55.620 
that collection that's called a Porsche

00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:57.110 
that collection that's called a Porsche
limited<00:00:56.069> one<00:00:56.699> thing<00:00:56.879> that<00:00:56.909> is<00:00:57.030> very

00:00:57.110 --> 00:00:57.120 
limited one thing that is very

00:00:57.120 --> 00:00:58.610 
limited one thing that is very
interesting<00:00:57.329> with<00:00:57.899> the<00:00:57.929> course<00:00:58.199> collection

00:00:58.610 --> 00:00:58.620 
interesting with the course collection

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:02.360 
interesting with the course collection
is<00:00:58.829> that<00:00:59.219> it's<00:00:59.339> not<00:00:59.489> only<00:00:59.780> apparel<00:01:00.780> and<00:01:01.370> Vivian

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:14.810 
the new Robo issues that we have so it's
a<00:01:12.150> fully<00:01:12.390> integrated<00:01:12.660> collection<00:01:13.670> let<00:01:14.670> me

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:14.820 
a fully integrated collection let me

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:17.570 
a fully integrated collection let me
start<00:01:15.060> with<00:01:15.180> the<00:01:15.330> race<00:01:16.040> jersey<00:01:17.040> basically<00:01:17.460> the

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:17.580 
start with the race jersey basically the

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:19.640 
start with the race jersey basically the
Rays<00:01:17.760> Rosie<00:01:18.150> main<00:01:18.990> concern<00:01:19.380> here<00:01:19.410> is

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:19.650 
Rays Rosie main concern here is

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:22.310 
Rays Rosie main concern here is
lightweight<00:01:20.220> and<00:01:20.400> I<00:01:20.880> are<00:01:20.940> dynamic<00:01:21.420> so<00:01:21.960> as<00:01:22.170> you

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:22.320 
lightweight and I are dynamic so as you

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:25.430 
lightweight and I are dynamic so as you
can<00:01:22.440> see<00:01:22.680> fabric<00:01:23.520> as<00:01:23.700> the<00:01:24.000> mondo<00:01:24.270> fabric<00:01:24.720> super

00:01:25.430 --> 00:01:25.440 
can see fabric as the mondo fabric super

00:01:25.440 --> 00:01:27.590 
can see fabric as the mondo fabric super
light<00:01:25.620> super<00:01:26.160> aerodynamic<00:01:26.550> what<00:01:27.060> we<00:01:27.210> did<00:01:27.390> we

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:27.600 
light super aerodynamic what we did we

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:30.020 
light super aerodynamic what we did we
remove<00:01:27.930> basically<00:01:28.440> all<00:01:28.590> the<00:01:28.920> scene<00:01:29.250> on<00:01:29.520> the

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:30.030 
remove basically all the scene on the

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:32.150 
remove basically all the scene on the
jersey<00:01:30.420> as<00:01:30.810> you<00:01:31.020> can<00:01:31.170> see<00:01:31.380> the<00:01:31.530> shoulder<00:01:31.950> which

00:01:32.150 --> 00:01:32.160 
jersey as you can see the shoulder which

00:01:32.160 --> 00:01:34.460 
jersey as you can see the shoulder which
is<00:01:32.280> a<00:01:32.310> very<00:01:32.610> important<00:01:33.090> part<00:01:33.470> aerodynamically

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:34.470 
is a very important part aerodynamically

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:36.650 
is a very important part aerodynamically
we<00:01:35.040> use<00:01:35.280> a<00:01:35.460> different<00:01:35.880> fabric<00:01:36.060> that's<00:01:36.420> called

00:01:36.650 --> 00:01:36.660 
we use a different fabric that's called

00:01:36.660 --> 00:01:39.170 
we use a different fabric that's called
speed<00:01:37.020> tap<00:01:37.400> one<00:01:38.400> thing<00:01:38.580> that<00:01:38.760> you<00:01:38.790> need<00:01:39.030> to

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:39.180 
speed tap one thing that you need to

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:41.150 
speed tap one thing that you need to
retain<00:01:39.690> on<00:01:39.840> this<00:01:40.020> is<00:01:40.200> all<00:01:40.560> the<00:01:40.890> course

00:01:41.150 --> 00:01:41.160 
retain on this is all the course

00:01:41.160 --> 00:01:43.310 
retain on this is all the course
collection<00:01:41.640> the<00:01:41.790> fabric<00:01:42.270> is<00:01:42.390> called<00:01:42.840> black<00:01:43.050> so

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:43.320 
collection the fabric is called black so

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:45.260 
collection the fabric is called black so
basically<00:01:43.680> it<00:01:43.920> will<00:01:44.100> control<00:01:44.940> body

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:45.270 
basically it will control body

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:47.540 
basically it will control body
temperature<00:01:45.810> by<00:01:46.500> reducing<00:01:47.070> the<00:01:47.220> effect<00:01:47.490> of

00:01:47.540 --> 00:01:47.550 
temperature by reducing the effect of

00:01:47.550 --> 00:01:49.399 
temperature by reducing the effect of
the<00:01:47.670> Sun<00:01:47.880> on<00:01:48.030> the<00:01:48.210> body<00:01:48.390> so<00:01:48.990> everything<00:01:49.380> you

00:01:49.399 --> 00:01:49.409 
the Sun on the body so everything you

00:01:49.409 --> 00:01:51.800 
the Sun on the body so everything you
see<00:01:49.500> here<00:01:49.980> it's<00:01:50.220> called<00:01:50.760> black<00:01:50.940> beaded<00:01:51.210> top

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:51.810 
see here it's called black beaded top

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:53.470 
see here it's called black beaded top
and<00:01:52.050> bottom

00:01:53.470 --> 00:01:53.480 
and bottom

00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:55.810 
and bottom
on<00:01:53.960> the<00:01:54.140> wrist<00:01:54.350> get<00:01:54.560> main<00:01:54.920> thing<00:01:55.160> lightweight

00:01:55.810 --> 00:01:55.820 
on the wrist get main thing lightweight

00:01:55.820 --> 00:01:59.800 
on the wrist get main thing lightweight
aerodynamic<00:01:57.280> the<00:01:58.280> bib<00:01:58.580> as<00:01:59.210> you<00:01:59.420> can<00:01:59.570> see

00:01:59.800 --> 00:01:59.810 
aerodynamic the bib as you can see

00:01:59.810 --> 00:02:02.710 
aerodynamic the bib as you can see
basically<00:02:00.170> is<00:02:00.550> seamless<00:02:01.550> we<00:02:02.300> have<00:02:02.420> removed

00:02:02.710 --> 00:02:02.720 
basically is seamless we have removed

00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:05.620 
basically is seamless we have removed
all<00:02:02.930> the<00:02:03.380> seams<00:02:03.800> on<00:02:04.160> the<00:02:04.880> babe<00:02:05.150> there's<00:02:05.450> no

00:02:05.620 --> 00:02:05.630 
all the seams on the babe there's no

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:07.450 
all the seams on the babe there's no
gripper<00:02:06.200> there's<00:02:06.560> no<00:02:06.680> power<00:02:06.860> band<00:02:07.160> so<00:02:07.250> it's<00:02:07.370> a

00:02:07.450 --> 00:02:07.460 
gripper there's no power band so it's a
