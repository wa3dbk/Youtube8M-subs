00:00:01.649 --> 00:00:05.960
 among the first places in 2 seconds and a third step of the podium are the successes 

00:00:05.960 --> 00:00:10.130
 so far united by the award-winning pedersoli and roman firm involved in the trophy 

00:00:10.129 --> 00:00:11.529
 asphalt rally 

00:00:11.529 --> 00:00:15.769
 with their ford focus the vieffecorse look down and direct 

00:00:15.769 --> 00:00:19.590
 strong pursuers in the lead of the general classification with 10 points of 

00:00:19.589 --> 00:00:24.119
 advantage over the rival crew the one composed of kings and barians a margin that 

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:27.810
 it has increased with the victory in the rally of the Appennino reggiano own 

00:00:27.809 --> 00:00:29.240
 use for us 

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:31.630
 hey particularly positive in a race 

00:00:31.630 --> 00:00:36.370
 frankly, our way of doing dance was ours 

00:00:36.370 --> 00:00:40.309
 adversary test won the last two editions for which he knew a lot 

00:00:40.309 --> 00:00:44.199
 well the race for him basically the race was a new race launching the new one 

00:00:44.199 --> 00:00:45.320
 lomo 

00:00:45.320 --> 00:00:48.520
 locus amor 13 years ago for which 

00:00:48.520 --> 00:00:52.570
 we say in fact they were not eggs and instead we were able to find them immediately 

00:00:52.570 --> 00:00:57.020
 the feeling with the review car came out immediately and I got under the 

00:00:57.020 --> 00:01:01.350
 command from start to finish the only one but I'm twitter starting the attack right away 

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:05.440
 and try to go straight to the top of the rankings 

00:01:05.950 --> 00:01:11.740
 where surely the result leads us once again to believe in the 

00:01:11.740 --> 00:01:13.830
 the final result is important 

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:18.410
 for which we count this we will try to continue so it is for the next races 

00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:22.210
 and now the next appointment for the san martino di castrozza rally where 

00:01:22.210 --> 00:01:25.480
 we arrive to defend, perhaps, to improve the third position of the 

00:01:25.480 --> 00:01:26.399
 last year 

00:01:26.399 --> 00:01:29.350
 san martino di castrozza maybe for us last year 

00:01:29.350 --> 00:01:34.530
 that he had represented we say the entrance on the podium immediately after 

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:38.320
 another race where we went to the podium then a splendid third place 

00:01:38.320 --> 00:01:42.229
 in a really very beautiful race like a public frame always 

00:01:42.229 --> 00:01:43.380
 unbelievable 

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:45.710
 so we hope to be short always 

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:48.740
 king kissed by the goddess gave her luck is 

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:51.670
 baby to make a good race without any problem 

00:01:51.670 --> 00:01:55.030
 a special recommendation is addressed via enthusiasts 

00:01:55.030 --> 00:01:56.640
 what's important is that 

00:01:56.640 --> 00:02:00.970
 they follow the race closely but always in a safe position 

00:02:00.970 --> 00:02:04.290
 pay attention to what I can be among the cars' vectors 

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:08.130
 it's nice that if a show for everyone and for those who are on the road but 

00:02:08.130 --> 00:02:09.810
 also for us of current in safety
