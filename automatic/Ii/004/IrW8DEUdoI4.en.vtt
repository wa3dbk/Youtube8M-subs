00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.629
 what you just told because what 

00:00:01.469 --> 00:00:06.420
 I just said I did not know how 

00:00:03.629 --> 00:00:09.259
 tell him I took the necessary time 

00:00:06.420 --> 00:00:09.259
 to tell 

00:00:12.100 --> 00:00:14.640
 I dont know 

00:00:20.790 --> 00:00:27.400
 if we talk and not tranqui showed 

00:00:24.369 --> 00:00:30.760
 quiet but see why I ask you 

00:00:27.400 --> 00:00:33.430
 this because a girl for me I know 

00:00:30.760 --> 00:00:37.000
 saying a 19 year old babe have the 

00:00:33.430 --> 00:00:40.540
 responsibility to make the decision of 

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:42.910
 tell him or not he could have waited and 

00:00:40.540 --> 00:00:46.570
 however you made the decision to 

00:00:42.910 --> 00:00:51.130
 tell him there he had the need 

00:00:46.570 --> 00:00:53.320
 It was very strong because I did not want to but I 

00:00:51.130 --> 00:00:55.540
 I did not want that more will come because 

00:00:53.320 --> 00:00:58.120
 also just a message came to me in that 

00:00:55.540 --> 00:01:00.579
 moment a journalist then at 

00:00:58.120 --> 00:01:02.980
 second I assumed that the police had 

00:01:00.579 --> 00:01:05.530
 told me what I did not want is that 

00:01:02.980 --> 00:01:07.180
 mom will land on that visa and she 

00:01:05.530 --> 00:01:09.070
 you will find the whole panorama of the 

00:01:07.180 --> 00:01:12.460
 journalists counting the thread had 

00:01:09.070 --> 00:01:14.410
 been tremendous then I imagined 

00:01:12.460 --> 00:01:15.550
 to that situation and they said good I have 

00:01:14.410 --> 00:01:18.340
 what to tell me before so that 

00:01:15.550 --> 00:01:19.570
 prepared with what you dictate what you're going to 

00:01:18.340 --> 00:01:21.190
 live 

00:01:19.570 --> 00:01:24.520
 barbara all this involved a 

00:01:21.190 --> 00:01:26.560
 reasoning is elaborated by you alone or 

00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:29.550
 you had a reference called someone 

00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:29.550
 or consultations you 

00:01:30.670 --> 00:01:34.500
 do not relax it at that time 

00:01:34.970 --> 00:01:39.980
 we can find no one to talk 

00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:42.400
 they knew she was desperate she did not know with 

00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:42.400
 who to speak 

00:01:43.400 --> 00:01:48.770
 what family means in your life going 

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:52.090
 beyond what one sees in the 

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:52.090
 images and everything 

00:01:53.409 --> 00:01:56.009
 fabian 

00:01:57.590 --> 00:02:03.189
 It was 

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:03.189
 the person that 

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:07.460
 achievement that we will form a family 

00:02:07.480 --> 00:02:13.090
 and just to tell you that I did not banque 

00:02:10.810 --> 00:02:16.530
 my mom had a good relationship with 

00:02:13.090 --> 00:02:19.190
 daniel after lots of time 

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:19.190
 they knew 

00:02:19.240 --> 00:02:25.140
 It was 

00:02:21.130 --> 00:02:25.140
 my second father by choice 

00:02:25.630 --> 00:02:29.580
 that I loved with all my soul 

00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:42.360
 was to have in the most amazing person 

00:02:37.810 --> 00:02:42.360
 that I knew in my life 

00:02:44.020 --> 00:02:48.380
 and what you say is true and I go out to 

00:02:46.240 --> 00:02:51.140
 recognize him 

00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:54.440
 like when he saw the frank family and 

00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:56.810
 he managed to fix a theme that was almost 

00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:59.300
 impossible barbie 

00:02:56.810 --> 00:03:03.050
 from your mom with danielle we remember that 

00:02:59.300 --> 00:03:04.670
 hug when he went to look for Gonzalo 

00:03:03.050 --> 00:03:08.300
 Daniel's house and we remember that 

00:03:04.670 --> 00:03:10.280
 very affectionate hug after all the 

00:03:08.300 --> 00:03:12.410
 episode so complicated that it had been 

00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:14.920
 between them two makes me define a 

00:03:12.410 --> 00:03:19.090
 little of that relationship 

00:03:14.920 --> 00:03:23.500

00:03:31.870 --> 00:03:36.700
 for the age that you have the truth because 

00:03:33.970 --> 00:03:38.080
 You went through something very fucking that I am 

00:03:36.700 --> 00:03:42.120
 Sincere I do not know how I would not have solved 

00:03:38.080 --> 00:03:45.120
 I felt that this change 

00:03:42.120 --> 00:03:48.470
 in everything I change I gave a 360 turn 

00:03:45.120 --> 00:03:48.470
 life degrees 

00:03:48.960 --> 00:03:55.340

00:04:02.209 --> 00:04:05.360
 obviously it is super present and has 

00:04:04.010 --> 00:04:06.950
 your moments when you need to be 

00:04:05.360 --> 00:04:09.560
 alone to be able to make his flight to 

00:04:06.950 --> 00:04:12.260
