else so to start off you can simply
choose<00:00:27.150> your<00:00:27.570> file<00:00:28.439> from<00:00:28.710> there<00:00:32.329> you<00:00:33.329> can

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:33.600 
choose your file from there you can

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:38.900 
choose your file from there you can
upload<00:00:34.110> your<00:00:34.469> GPX<00:00:35.460> file<00:00:37.489> you<00:00:38.489> choose<00:00:38.730> the

possibility of Dominic many files at the
time<00:01:45.840> so<00:01:46.840> we're<00:01:47.350> gonna<00:01:47.470> start<00:01:47.860> by<00:01:48.150> uploading

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:49.150 
time so we're gonna start by uploading

00:01:49.150 --> 00:01:56.639 
time so we're gonna start by uploading
our<00:01:49.659> GPX<00:01:50.909> funds<00:01:53.790> so<00:01:54.790> this<00:01:55.060> represents<00:01:55.720> some<00:01:56.619> of

00:01:56.639 --> 00:01:56.649 
our GPX funds so this represents some of

00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:40.110 
okay so we've got our GPX files now so

00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:43.070 
okay so we've got our GPX files now so
we've<00:02:40.230> got<00:02:40.410> three<00:02:40.950> GPX<00:02:41.520> files<00:02:42.120> so<00:02:42.660> we<00:02:42.780> can<00:02:42.930> also

00:02:43.070 --> 00:02:43.080 
we've got three GPX files so we can also

00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:49.550 
we've got three GPX files so we can also
choose<00:02:43.739> to<00:02:43.800> add<00:02:43.980> more<00:02:45.980> if<00:02:46.980> we<00:02:47.220> want<00:02:48.230> the<00:02:49.230> width

trips<00:03:03.980> you<00:03:04.980> might<00:03:05.430> type<00:03:05.760> won't<00:03:06.180> be<00:03:06.360> Google

00:03:07.100 --> 00:03:07.110 
trips you might type won't be Google

00:03:07.110 --> 00:03:10.910 
trips you might type won't be Google
street<00:03:07.380> maps<00:03:07.620> we've<00:03:07.890> got<00:03:08.360> the<00:03:09.360> choice<00:03:09.890> among<00:03:10.890> a

00:03:10.910 --> 00:03:10.920 
street maps we've got the choice among a

00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:18.470 
street maps we've got the choice among a
full<00:03:11.519> range<00:03:12.060> of<00:03:12.350> background<00:03:13.350> months<00:03:16.730> and<00:03:17.730> we

00:03:18.470 --> 00:03:18.480 
full range of background months and we

00:03:18.480 --> 00:03:25.100 
full range of background months and we
will<00:03:19.850> choose<00:03:20.850> to<00:03:21.510> represent<00:03:22.440> the<00:03:22.620> day<00:03:23.989> for<00:03:24.989> the

00:03:25.100 --> 00:03:25.110 
will choose to represent the day for the

00:03:25.110 --> 00:03:27.140 
will choose to represent the day for the
elevation<00:03:25.380> so<00:03:26.010> we<00:03:26.100> can<00:03:26.310> keep<00:03:26.459> the<00:03:26.610> default

00:03:27.140 --> 00:03:27.150 
elevation so we can keep the default

00:03:27.150 --> 00:03:31.990 
elevation so we can keep the default
color<00:03:27.480> as<00:03:27.750> it<00:03:27.870> is<00:03:28.190> as<00:03:29.190> it<00:03:29.250> will<00:03:29.670> be<00:03:30.019> graduated

00:03:31.990 --> 00:03:32.000 
color as it is as it will be graduated

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:36.560 
color as it is as it will be graduated
according<00:03:33.000> to<00:03:33.269> the<00:03:33.470> elevation<00:03:34.470> of<00:03:34.760> each<00:03:35.760> GPS

00:03:36.560 --> 00:03:36.570 
according to the elevation of each GPS

00:03:36.570 --> 00:03:39.860 
according to the elevation of each GPS
coordinate<00:03:37.370> and<00:03:38.370> now<00:03:38.549> we're<00:03:38.790> ready<00:03:38.970> to<00:03:39.120> create

00:03:39.860 --> 00:03:39.870 
coordinate and now we're ready to create

00:03:39.870 --> 00:03:43.970 
coordinate and now we're ready to create
our<00:03:40.049> map<00:03:41.900> we'll<00:03:42.900> just<00:03:43.109> click<00:03:43.260> on<00:03:43.440> draw<00:03:43.590> the<00:03:43.650> map

00:03:43.970 --> 00:03:43.980 
our map we'll just click on draw the map

00:03:43.980 --> 00:03:48.470 
our map we'll just click on draw the map
so<00:03:44.370> here<00:03:44.700> we<00:03:44.820> are<00:03:45.049> this<00:03:46.049> is<00:03:46.250> the<00:03:47.250> three<00:03:47.730> GPX

00:03:48.470 --> 00:03:48.480 
so here we are this is the three GPX

00:03:48.480 --> 00:03:55.099 
so here we are this is the three GPX
