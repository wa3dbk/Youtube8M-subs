00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:10.710
 hello friends today we will learn to do 

00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:12.629
 this beautiful and simple bunny that 

00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:14.400
 does with a single balloon and good and 

00:00:12.629 --> 00:00:16.590
 we want we can add other 

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:19.710
 details as we will in this case 

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:21.900
 putting what is your carrot and 

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:23.580
 we will need a little extra balloon 

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:26.310
 that we have enlarged what is 

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:28.910
 the tip and a piece of green balloon 

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:31.250
 Well, let's start 

00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:33.020
 let's try then our balloon 

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:35.660
 White 

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:38.470
 to nine fingers without inflating and we're going to 

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:42.890
 start by making a ball first 

00:00:38.470 --> 00:00:46.329
 approximately two fingers and previously 

00:00:42.890 --> 00:00:48.460
 we leave the mouthpiece a little long 

00:00:46.329 --> 00:00:51.489
 now let's see a sausage from 

00:00:48.460 --> 00:00:56.190
 four of the approximately we do 

00:00:51.489 --> 00:00:56.190
 another one of the same size and we are going to roll them 

00:00:57.150 --> 00:01:03.000
 Now let's do before doing the 

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:06.540
 another ball we pass wind through here in 

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:08.370
 means that we do not get rid of 

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:12.390
 open this part now if we do 

00:01:08.370 --> 00:01:14.130
 another ball of the same size trying 

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:15.960
 that we are left the same as they will be 

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:17.940
 eyes and because they have to do with it 

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:20.760
 proportion 

00:01:17.940 --> 00:01:25.100
 we sin then we want equal what 

00:01:20.760 --> 00:01:25.100
 are the little balls and now we are going 

00:01:25.800 --> 00:01:28.310
 this part 

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:34.759
 and good so that the ears are not left 

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:37.700
 here in the middle 

00:01:34.759 --> 00:01:43.210
 let them derechitas and what 

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:43.210
 is that the nozzle over 

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:50.840
 and we go again to pass the mouthpiece 

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:50.840
 here and we will miss it has 

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:56.710
 and good look towards us we will remain 

00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:56.710
 completely 50 for me 

00:01:56.820 --> 00:02:04.350
 it is already fixed now and nothing else what 

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:07.280
 what we are going to do now is with a 

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:07.280
 ball again 

00:02:11.490 --> 00:02:16.190
 more or less than one or two fingers too 

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:20.840
 and we will make her happy 

00:02:22.300 --> 00:02:26.290
 Now let's make a sausage 

00:02:24.370 --> 00:02:29.140
 we travel in the air 

00:02:26.290 --> 00:02:33.090
 we make a three-finger sausage and the 

00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:33.090
 let's make a metallic 

00:02:35.490 --> 00:02:41.560
 charge us the same sausage three 

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:46.500
 previously fingers that we run from the air 

00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:46.500
 and we're going to make it a little pot too 

00:02:50.630 --> 00:02:55.390
 now we're just going to start 

00:02:52.580 --> 00:02:55.390
 our wedding 

00:03:03.630 --> 00:03:09.450
 yes 

00:03:05.700 --> 00:03:12.030
 and well look at everything already accommodated now 

00:03:09.450 --> 00:03:16.140
 nothing else you're going to do is a 

00:03:12.030 --> 00:03:19.489
 ball of approximately one 

00:03:16.140 --> 00:03:19.489
 finger for what is the neck 

00:03:21.110 --> 00:03:28.600
 now we will do 

00:03:24.140 --> 00:03:28.600
 two greetings sausages 

00:03:29.920 --> 00:03:33.760
 and let's throw 

00:03:34.340 --> 00:03:40.190
 and will remain unformed humans now 

00:03:38.030 --> 00:03:42.459
 let's make a three sausage 

00:03:40.190 --> 00:03:42.459
 fingers 

00:03:42.590 --> 00:03:46.640
 we make 

00:03:44.590 --> 00:03:49.940
 4 

00:03:46.640 --> 00:03:53.080
 another one of the same size and good the piece 

00:03:49.940 --> 00:03:53.080
 that the city offers us 

00:03:54.620 --> 00:03:59.220
 and well look, we have practically already 

00:03:57.330 --> 00:04:01.530
 here finished what is our 

00:03:59.220 --> 00:04:05.450
 Bunny and anything else they 

00:04:01.530 --> 00:04:08.730
 I mentioned the detail of the carrot 

00:04:05.450 --> 00:04:10.710
 let's stop right now let's tantito 

00:04:08.730 --> 00:04:12.690
 cut this part and we will tie 

00:04:10.710 --> 00:04:15.440
 here this piece that we have of 

00:04:12.690 --> 00:04:15.440
 excellent green 

00:04:15.550 --> 00:04:18.690
 we are going to kill 

00:04:29.020 --> 00:04:35.060
 now if we count this part and good we 

00:04:32.840 --> 00:04:37.460
 It has thus been now nothing more than 

00:04:35.060 --> 00:04:39.110
 we have to do is depending on the 

00:04:37.460 --> 00:04:40.700
 long that we will want here 

00:04:39.110 --> 00:04:43.220
 I'm going to cut this piece because it's 

00:04:40.700 --> 00:04:48.370
 very long and now we're going to start 

00:04:43.220 --> 00:04:48.370
 to cut what is the balloon in strips like this 

00:04:58.270 --> 00:05:03.910
 This is how our balloon is going 

00:05:01.270 --> 00:05:06.070
 it was already formed what is this part already 

00:05:03.910 --> 00:05:09.000
 nothing else what we have to do is 

00:05:06.070 --> 00:05:09.000
 screw up 

00:05:22.900 --> 00:05:28.730
 do not 

00:05:24.980 --> 00:05:32.550
 it fits very well and look, it's already going 

00:05:28.730 --> 00:05:35.720
 seeing a package like that 

00:05:32.550 --> 00:05:37.950
 now if we want to give it to children 

00:05:35.720 --> 00:05:40.950
 also in a wand as we can 

00:05:37.950 --> 00:05:45.380
 do it quickly we leave the mouthpiece 

00:05:40.950 --> 00:05:45.380
 long three sticks 

00:05:46.980 --> 00:05:50.030
 we are not with the left 

00:05:57.200 --> 00:06:10.840
 so with this we go to this part 

00:06:08.300 --> 00:06:10.840
 full 

00:06:11.240 --> 00:06:18.250
 let's say so good look like this 

00:06:14.270 --> 00:06:18.250
 will have already been what is our 

00:06:18.380 --> 00:06:22.700
 bunny in its base now and nothing else 

00:06:21.020 --> 00:06:25.010
 because you have to make a very decorated 

00:06:22.700 --> 00:06:27.680
 nice of your eyes so we make them 

00:06:25.010 --> 00:06:29.930
 round eyes rather oval 

00:06:27.680 --> 00:06:32.830
 great looks pretty I'm going to show you 

00:06:29.930 --> 00:06:32.830
 How I did it 

00:06:40.320 --> 00:06:44.250
 and well look, it had been very 

00:06:42.330 --> 00:06:47.810
 fast and it's very easy to decorate 

00:06:44.250 --> 00:06:47.810
 the eyes of our rabbit 

00:06:52.440 --> 00:06:56.160
 and good friends, well, whatever 

00:06:54.330 --> 00:06:58.410
 want to simply make the bunny 

00:06:56.160 --> 00:07:01.230
 well or put it in your base with your 

00:06:58.410 --> 00:07:02.610
 carrot this or another way and good 

00:07:01.230 --> 00:07:04.230
 in either of the two I think that 

00:07:02.610 --> 00:07:06.450
 The children will like it very much and I hope that 

00:07:04.230 --> 00:07:09.770
 you also good, well, see you in 

00:07:06.450 --> 00:07:09.770
 the next tutorial see you later
