would have this shot zoomed in if I were

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:52.609 
would have this shot zoomed in if I were

I've<00:01:57.119> already<00:01:57.299> do<00:01:57.719> that<00:01:58.020> I<00:01:58.259> could<00:01:58.560> create<00:01:58.829> a

00:01:58.910 --> 00:01:58.920 
I've already do that I could create a

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:00.770 
I've already do that I could create a
really<00:01:59.310> interesting<00:01:59.820> effect<00:02:00.149> here<00:02:00.420> so<00:02:00.750> I

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:00.780 
really interesting effect here so I

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:03.380 
really interesting effect here so I
could<00:02:01.079> have<00:02:01.290> the<00:02:02.219> green<00:02:02.460> box<00:02:02.700> is<00:02:03.030> where<00:02:03.240> the

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:03.390 
could have the green box is where the

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:05.179 
could have the green box is where the
camera<00:02:03.750> starts<00:02:04.229> in<00:02:04.380> the<00:02:04.469> clip<00:02:04.710> and<00:02:04.890> the<00:02:05.009> red

00:02:05.179 --> 00:02:05.189 
camera starts in the clip and the red

00:02:05.189 --> 00:02:07.850 
camera starts in the clip and the red
box<00:02:05.490> is<00:02:05.670> where<00:02:05.850> it<00:02:05.969> ends<00:02:06.600> so<00:02:07.380> I<00:02:07.469> can<00:02:07.619> actually

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:07.860 
box is where it ends so I can actually

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:11.449 
box is where it ends so I can actually
have<00:02:08.399> the<00:02:08.640> camera<00:02:09.259> move<00:02:10.259> from<00:02:10.890> the<00:02:11.009> green<00:02:11.190> box

00:02:11.449 --> 00:02:11.459 
have the camera move from the green box

00:02:11.459 --> 00:02:13.339 
have the camera move from the green box
to<00:02:11.760> the<00:02:12.060> red<00:02:12.209> box<00:02:12.450> over<00:02:12.810> the<00:02:12.900> course<00:02:13.140> of<00:02:13.260> the

00:02:13.349 --> 00:02:13.860 
to the red box over the course of the
video

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:13.870 
video

00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:17.610 
video
in<00:02:14.440> fact<00:02:14.650> actually<00:02:14.860> if<00:02:15.129> I<00:02:15.989> preview<00:02:16.989> this<00:02:17.349> right

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:17.620 
in fact actually if I preview this right

00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:19.800 
in fact actually if I preview this right
here<00:02:18.010> you<00:02:18.730> can<00:02:18.879> see<00:02:18.910> that's<00:02:19.239> what<00:02:19.510> the<00:02:19.599> video

00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:19.810 
here you can see that's what the video

00:02:19.810 --> 00:02:21.000 
here you can see that's what the video
clip<00:02:20.019> would<00:02:20.140> look<00:02:20.319> like<00:02:20.500> this<00:02:20.709> is<00:02:20.800> a<00:02:20.830> way<00:02:20.980> of

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:21.010 
clip would look like this is a way of

00:02:21.010 --> 00:02:23.190 
clip would look like this is a way of
taking<00:02:21.310> still<00:02:21.760> photos<00:02:21.790> and<00:02:22.360> making<00:02:23.080> them

00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:23.200 
taking still photos and making them

00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:27.780 
taking still photos and making them
animated<00:02:23.860> in<00:02:24.010> a<00:02:24.129> video<00:02:24.900> I<00:02:26.250> can<00:02:27.250> add<00:02:27.430> the<00:02:27.610> same

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:27.790 
animated in a video I can add the same

00:02:27.790 --> 00:02:31.940 
animated in a video I can add the same
kinds<00:02:28.060> of<00:02:28.120> transitions<00:02:28.540> but<00:02:28.950> between<00:02:29.950> between

00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:31.950 
kinds of transitions but between between

00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:34.589 
kinds of transitions but between between
clips<00:02:32.950> with<00:02:33.370> still<00:02:33.700> images<00:02:34.000> as<00:02:34.150> I<00:02:34.269> could<00:02:34.480> with

00:02:34.589 --> 00:02:34.599 
clips with still images as I could with

00:02:34.599 --> 00:02:42.750 
clips with still images as I could with
videos<00:02:35.549> in<00:02:36.549> fact<00:02:37.470> if<00:02:38.470> I<00:02:39.310> if<00:02:39.549> I<00:02:39.910> were<00:02:40.900> to<00:02:41.760> start

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:42.760 
videos in fact if I if I were to start

00:02:42.760 --> 00:02:44.430 
videos in fact if I if I were to start
looking<00:02:43.299> at<00:02:43.390> this<00:02:43.480> it<00:02:43.720> turns<00:02:44.019> out<00:02:44.200> that<00:02:44.319> I<00:02:44.410> can

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:44.440 
looking at this it turns out that I can

00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:49.440 
looking at this it turns out that I can
actually<00:02:45.299> edit<00:02:46.299> my<00:02:47.049> video<00:02:47.500> my<00:02:48.060> still<00:02:49.060> images

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:49.450 
actually edit my video my still images

00:02:49.450 --> 00:02:51.030 
actually edit my video my still images
in<00:02:49.599> much<00:02:49.810> the<00:02:49.930> same<00:02:50.049> way<00:02:50.230> as<00:02:50.349> video<00:02:50.650> clips<00:02:50.950> I

00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:51.040 
in much the same way as video clips I

00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:53.520 
in much the same way as video clips I
can<00:02:51.190> add<00:02:51.370> voiceovers<00:02:52.060> I<00:02:52.269> can<00:02:52.420> add<00:02:52.599> effects<00:02:53.349> I

can add music I can also adjust
double<00:02:58.030> click<00:02:58.299> on<00:02:58.480> a<00:02:59.640> photo<00:03:00.640> clip<00:03:00.940> I<00:03:01.180> have<00:03:01.569> an

00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:01.660 
double click on a photo clip I have an

00:03:01.660 --> 00:03:03.600 
double click on a photo clip I have an

00:03:05.039 --> 00:03:05.049 
for by default they all start up for

00:03:05.049 --> 00:03:06.780 
for by default they all start up for
three<00:03:05.200> and<00:03:05.290> a<00:03:05.349> half<00:03:05.379> seconds<00:03:05.980> but<00:03:06.519> if<00:03:06.579> I<00:03:06.640> want

00:03:06.780 --> 00:03:06.790 
three and a half seconds but if I want

00:03:06.790 --> 00:03:09.690 
three and a half seconds but if I want
to<00:03:06.879> have<00:03:06.940> a<00:03:07.019> ten-second<00:03:08.019> slow<00:03:08.440> pan<00:03:08.950> over<00:03:09.519> this

00:03:09.690 --> 00:03:09.700 
to have a ten-second slow pan over this

00:03:09.700 --> 00:03:12.089 
to have a ten-second slow pan over this
I<00:03:10.030> could<00:03:10.840> have<00:03:11.079> that<00:03:11.319> so<00:03:11.560> it<00:03:11.680> would<00:03:11.739> be<00:03:11.860> a<00:03:11.890> very

00:03:12.089 --> 00:03:12.099 
I could have that so it would be a very

00:03:12.099 --> 00:03:14.130 
I could have that so it would be a very
different<00:03:12.310> effect<00:03:12.489> right<00:03:12.970> be<00:03:13.599> moving<00:03:13.930> more

00:03:14.130 --> 00:03:14.140 
different effect right be moving more

00:03:14.140 --> 00:03:19.170 
different effect right be moving more
slowly<00:03:14.200> through<00:03:14.829> this<00:03:16.319> and<00:03:17.489> you<00:03:18.489> once<00:03:19.030> you've

00:03:19.170 --> 00:03:19.180 
slowly through this and you once you've

slowly through this and you once you've
put<00:03:19.420> still<00:03:20.319> images<00:03:20.590> in<00:03:20.739> you<00:03:20.889> can<00:03:21.069> also<00:03:21.370> if<00:03:22.120> you

00:03:22.259 --> 00:03:22.269 
put still images in you can also if you

00:03:22.269 --> 00:03:24.690 
put still images in you can also if you
