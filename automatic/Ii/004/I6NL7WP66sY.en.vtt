00:00:07.240 --> 00:00:10.929
 the painting that we have painted is the one 

00:00:09.190 --> 00:00:12.760
 we see on the screen which has 

00:00:10.929 --> 00:00:16.469
 allowed to know very procedures 

00:00:12.760 --> 00:00:16.469
 interesting of Chinese influence 

00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:24.730
 sponge painting offers infinite 

00:00:22.660 --> 00:00:27.390
 of possibilities and is ideal for 

00:00:24.730 --> 00:00:27.390
 creative exploration 

00:00:30.030 --> 00:00:34.260
 besides the sponge as an element 

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:36.210
 main we have also employed others 

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:38.600
 like the tampon the eraser and the 

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:38.600
 ink 

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:47.510
 we will start the painting by painting the clouds 

00:00:45.559 --> 00:00:50.710
 for this background we outline the 

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:50.710
 limit using a pencil 

00:00:56.870 --> 00:01:00.920
 the ink layer that we will give by 

00:00:58.879 --> 00:01:03.230
 The whole surface in principle will be very 

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:06.610
 dim that will allow to maintain the texture 

00:01:03.230 --> 00:01:06.610
 of the paper without being altered 

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:14.430
 For this we will use the sponge 

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:16.560
 coarse grain moistening it slightly 

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:20.479
 on the cap and doing some test 

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:20.479
 once in a while on a disposable paper 

00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:30.220
 in this picture it is very difficult to rectify 

00:01:28.360 --> 00:01:32.440
 so you have to plan before 

00:01:30.220 --> 00:01:35.400
 each stage because in the ink is 

00:01:32.440 --> 00:01:35.400
 very complicated to erase 

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:44.930
 it's not like the oil painting that is 

00:01:42.680 --> 00:01:46.520
 you can correct how many times you want it 

00:01:44.930 --> 00:01:48.650
 that also forces to have a certain 

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:51.550
 order overlapping the first planes 

00:01:48.650 --> 00:01:51.550
 on the background 

00:01:56.460 --> 00:02:02.570
 it would not have been consistent to paint the 

00:01:58.650 --> 00:02:02.570
 vegetation before the bottom of the picture 

00:02:04.659 --> 00:02:08.769
 we will apply the impregnated sponge 

00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:11.230
 of ink until the background is considered 

00:02:08.769 --> 00:02:12.700
 is sufficiently obscured in case of 

00:02:11.230 --> 00:02:15.069
 that there is some point left in black 

00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:19.170
 very prominent we will have as a resource 

00:02:15.069 --> 00:02:19.170
 use a white pencil rectifier 

00:02:22.150 --> 00:02:26.829
 as for the limits of the pencil not 

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:28.720
 it matters to leave something since to be clouds 

00:02:26.829 --> 00:02:31.470
 they do not have a very strictly contour 

00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:31.470
 definite 

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:40.769
 in the base we will also give a pass 

00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:42.920
 very faint to simulate the surface of the 

00:02:40.769 --> 00:02:42.920
 lake 

00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:50.770
 when the whole background of the painting is 

00:02:48.700 --> 00:02:54.390
 dry we can erase the pencil without 

00:02:50.770 --> 00:02:54.390
 problems of ink being dragged 

00:02:57.550 --> 00:03:01.360
 alluding to the theme of the painting the 

00:02:59.890 --> 00:03:05.760
 scene unfolds on the shores of a 

00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:05.760
 lake doing pelican fishing 

00:03:13.450 --> 00:03:17.890
 to draw it first we have done 

00:03:15.819 --> 00:03:20.200
 the sketch in pencil to then review what 

00:03:17.890 --> 00:03:22.390
 content, keeping in mind that the 

00:03:20.200 --> 00:03:25.410
 size of the drawing be proportional to 

00:03:22.390 --> 00:03:25.410
 the rest of elements 

00:03:31.940 --> 00:03:36.080
 Another factor to take into account is the 

00:03:34.130 --> 00:03:37.910
 position of the boat with respect to 

00:03:36.080 --> 00:03:40.870
 distance of the vegetation that we will put 

00:03:37.910 --> 00:03:40.870
 later 

00:03:44.819 --> 00:03:48.749
 when we finish painting the clouds 

00:03:46.950 --> 00:03:50.999
 from the bottom we will proceed to paint the 

00:03:48.749 --> 00:03:53.280
 vegetation on the shores of the lake for it 

00:03:50.999 --> 00:03:55.730
 previously we will outline the outline with 

00:03:53.280 --> 00:03:55.730
 a pencil 

00:04:01.770 --> 00:04:06.060
 we will paint this area with the sponge 

00:04:03.900 --> 00:04:08.310
 of coarse grain for this we will locate 

00:04:06.060 --> 00:04:10.020
 the most linear part of the sponge the 

00:04:08.310 --> 00:04:12.060
 impregnates with ink moss and we will go 

00:04:10.020 --> 00:04:14.810
 smearing horizontally on the part 

00:04:12.060 --> 00:04:14.810
 drawn in pencil 

00:04:20.660 --> 00:04:25.370
 this operation does not have much difficulty 

00:04:22.400 --> 00:04:27.110
 in order to load the sponge with ink and 

00:04:25.370 --> 00:04:30.010
 try not to go beyond the limit of 

00:04:27.110 --> 00:04:30.010
 pencil outline 

00:04:34.040 --> 00:04:37.960
 we will use an eraser to 

00:04:36.140 --> 00:04:40.130
 paint the stems of the vegetation 

00:04:37.960 --> 00:04:42.410
 previously with a half - round 

00:04:40.130 --> 00:04:44.680
 we will give curved shape like here we can 

00:04:42.410 --> 00:04:44.680
 watch 

00:04:51.380 --> 00:04:55.550
 we will do a test to see the result 

00:04:53.750 --> 00:04:57.050
 with the eraser pressing 

00:04:55.550 --> 00:04:59.380
 uneven so that the stems are 

00:04:57.050 --> 00:04:59.380
 different 

00:05:11.070 --> 00:05:15.240
 we will present the vegetation making a 

00:05:13.410 --> 00:05:16.830
 pencil sketch of the drawing 

00:05:15.240 --> 00:05:19.380
 in this way we will see if the 

00:05:16.830 --> 00:05:22.790
 distribution before applying the ink 

00:05:19.380 --> 00:05:22.790
 that she will then be final 

00:05:34.500 --> 00:05:38.580
 with the coarse grain sponge we will make 

00:05:36.510 --> 00:05:40.460
 the first strokes determining the 

00:05:38.580 --> 00:05:44.510
 amount of vegetation that we are going to put 

00:05:40.460 --> 00:05:44.510
 trying not to leave it too loaded 

00:05:55.600 --> 00:05:58.810
 just like we 've been smearing the 

00:05:57.340 --> 00:06:01.570
 sponge we will do with the eraser 

00:05:58.810 --> 00:06:05.610
 to paint the vegetation on the 

00:06:01.570 --> 00:06:05.610
 pencil strokes done previously 

00:06:17.710 --> 00:06:21.970
 we will wet the rubber in the tampon 

00:06:19.990 --> 00:06:24.400
 to then spread it carefully 

00:06:21.970 --> 00:06:27.750
 on the drawing without accenting too much 

00:06:24.400 --> 00:06:27.750
 the black part so as not to smudge 

00:06:36.270 --> 00:06:40.590
 we will finish by saying that this painting 

00:06:38.340 --> 00:06:42.380
 has hardly had difficulty following the 

00:06:40.590 --> 00:06:45.380
 mechanics and using the elements 

00:06:42.380 --> 00:06:45.380
 specified
