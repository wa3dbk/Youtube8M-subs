doesn't<00:02:21.440> actually<00:02:21.620> react<00:02:22.160> to<00:02:22.340> the<00:02:22.430> ball<00:02:22.640> and

00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:22.910 
doesn't actually react to the ball and

00:02:22.910 --> 00:02:25.810 
doesn't actually react to the ball and
for<00:02:23.120> letting<00:02:23.690> hear<00:02:24.250> that<00:02:25.250> but<00:02:25.430> if<00:02:25.519> they<00:02:25.610> might

00:02:25.810 --> 00:02:25.820 
for letting hear that but if they might

00:02:25.820 --> 00:02:28.420 
for letting hear that but if they might
also<00:02:26.030> plays<00:02:26.989> through<00:02:27.410> that's<00:02:27.769> exactly<00:02:27.980> what

00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:28.430 
also plays through that's exactly what

00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:30.960 
also plays through that's exactly what
you<00:02:28.580> do<00:02:28.760> so<00:02:29.269> two<00:02:29.330> plays<00:02:29.780> later<00:02:29.810> Kaepernick

00:02:30.960 --> 00:02:30.970 
you do so two plays later Kaepernick

00:02:30.970 --> 00:02:34.270 
you do so two plays later Kaepernick
