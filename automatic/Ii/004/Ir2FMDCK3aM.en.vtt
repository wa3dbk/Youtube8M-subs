00:02:37.660 --> 00:02:39.360 
I think I've just demonstrated for when
you<00:02:37.780> pulled<00:02:38.260> on<00:02:38.380> plug<00:02:39.100> out<00:02:39.250> of<00:02:39.280> the

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:39.370 
you pulled on plug out of the

00:02:39.370 --> 00:02:41.970 
you pulled on plug out of the
hemispherical<00:02:39.880> engine<00:02:40.150> like<00:02:40.269> this<00:02:40.799> you<00:02:41.799> want

00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:41.980 
hemispherical engine like this you want

00:02:41.980 --> 00:02:44.400 
hemispherical engine like this you want
to<00:02:42.100> when<00:02:42.940> you<00:02:43.030> pull<00:02:43.180> the<00:02:43.329> boot<00:02:43.510> off<00:02:43.810> the<00:02:44.170> spark

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:44.410 
to when you pull the boot off the spark

00:02:44.410 --> 00:02:45.930 
to when you pull the boot off the spark
plug<00:02:44.590> before<00:02:44.680> you<00:02:44.950> take<00:02:45.100> that<00:02:45.130> plug<00:02:45.489> out<00:02:45.670> use

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:45.940 
plug before you take that plug out use

00:02:45.940 --> 00:02:48.180 
plug before you take that plug out use
an<00:02:46.060> air<00:02:46.209> hose<00:02:46.390> and<00:02:46.420> blow<00:02:46.810> air<00:02:46.989> down<00:02:47.950> in<00:02:48.070> there

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:48.190 
an air hose and blow air down in there

00:02:48.190 --> 00:02:49.680 
an air hose and blow air down in there
to<00:02:48.310> get<00:02:48.459> all<00:02:48.549> the<00:02:48.700> debris<00:02:48.820> and<00:02:49.030> stuff<00:02:49.180> out<00:02:49.480> so

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:49.690 
to get all the debris and stuff out so

00:02:49.690 --> 00:02:51.569 
to get all the debris and stuff out so
it<00:02:49.840> doesn't<00:02:50.140> go<00:02:50.200> down<00:02:50.230> inside<00:02:50.590> the<00:02:50.739> engine<00:02:50.890> so

00:02:51.569 --> 00:02:51.579 
it doesn't go down inside the engine so

00:02:51.579 --> 00:02:54.500 
it doesn't go down inside the engine so
next<00:02:52.540> step<00:02:52.690> is<00:02:52.900> to<00:02:53.079> pull<00:02:53.260> plugs

00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:54.510 
next step is to pull plugs

00:02:54.510 --> 00:02:57.270 
next step is to pull plugs
well<00:02:55.510> I<00:02:55.630> change<00:02:55.870> the<00:02:56.019> coil<00:02:56.200> it<00:02:56.829> would<00:02:56.980> turn<00:02:57.130> it

00:02:57.270 --> 00:02:57.280 
well I change the coil it would turn it

00:02:57.280 --> 00:03:00.720 
well I change the coil it would turn it
to<00:02:57.370> be<00:02:57.519> this<00:02:58.329> coil<00:02:58.630> pack

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:00.730 
to be this coil pack

00:03:00.730 --> 00:03:03.040 
to be this coil pack
this<00:03:01.730> one<00:03:01.940> bond<00:03:02.120> I<00:03:02.150> normally<00:03:02.569> change<00:03:02.810> both

00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:03.050 
this one bond I normally change both

00:03:03.050 --> 00:03:04.210 
this one bond I normally change both
like<00:03:03.379> I<00:03:03.409> said<00:03:03.560> the<00:03:03.620> customer<00:03:03.920> is<00:03:03.980> trying<00:03:04.159> to

00:03:04.210 --> 00:03:04.220 
like I said the customer is trying to

00:03:04.220 --> 00:03:06.250 
like I said the customer is trying to
keep<00:03:04.310> the<00:03:04.370> cost<00:03:04.879> down

00:03:06.250 --> 00:03:06.260 
keep the cost down

00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:08.770 
keep the cost down
I<00:03:06.760> pulled<00:03:07.760> the<00:03:07.819> spark<00:03:08.060> plugs<00:03:08.269> looked<00:03:08.510> at<00:03:08.659> him

00:03:08.770 --> 00:03:08.780 
I pulled the spark plugs looked at him

00:03:08.780 --> 00:03:10.390 
I pulled the spark plugs looked at him
and<00:03:09.019> I<00:03:09.379> would<00:03:09.500> have<00:03:09.590> shown<00:03:09.799> it<00:03:09.950> but<00:03:10.069> every<00:03:10.250> one

00:03:10.390 --> 00:03:10.400 
and I would have shown it but every one

00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:11.890 
and I would have shown it but every one
of<00:03:10.430> them<00:03:10.610> looked<00:03:10.790> about<00:03:11.000> the<00:03:11.060> same<00:03:11.180> I<00:03:11.390> just<00:03:11.720> had

00:03:11.890 --> 00:03:11.900 
of them looked about the same I just had

00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:13.300 
of them looked about the same I just had
one<00:03:12.140> hint<00:03:12.470> that<00:03:12.530> they're<00:03:12.769> actually<00:03:12.920> the<00:03:13.159> one

00:03:13.300 --> 00:03:13.310 
one hint that they're actually the one

00:03:13.310 --> 00:03:14.860 
one hint that they're actually the one
the<00:03:13.549> school<00:03:13.790> over<00:03:14.000> packed<00:03:14.239> the<00:03:14.420> sits<00:03:14.629> on<00:03:14.750> top

00:03:14.860 --> 00:03:14.870 
the school over packed the sits on top

00:03:14.870 --> 00:03:18.490 
the school over packed the sits on top
of<00:03:14.930> this<00:03:15.709> was<00:03:15.890> a<00:03:15.920> little<00:03:16.250> darker<00:03:16.610> than<00:03:17.500> the

00:03:18.490 --> 00:03:18.500 
of this was a little darker than the

00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:20.020 
of this was a little darker than the
rest<00:03:18.709> of<00:03:18.890> them<00:03:19.040> but<00:03:19.280> not<00:03:19.400> enough<00:03:19.670> didn't<00:03:19.940> even

00:03:20.020 --> 00:03:20.030 
rest of them but not enough didn't even

00:03:20.030 --> 00:03:21.850 
rest of them but not enough didn't even
smell<00:03:20.239> a<00:03:20.299> gas<00:03:20.540> so<00:03:20.780> I<00:03:20.810> just<00:03:20.989> took<00:03:21.170> a<00:03:21.290> gas<00:03:21.530> and

00:03:21.850 --> 00:03:21.860 
smell a gas so I just took a gas and

00:03:21.860 --> 00:03:23.320 
smell a gas so I just took a gas and
that<00:03:21.980> was<00:03:22.099> a<00:03:22.129> warning<00:03:22.370> so<00:03:22.849> far<00:03:23.030> I<00:03:23.060> guessed

00:03:23.320 --> 00:03:23.330 
that was a warning so far I guessed

00:03:23.330 --> 00:03:26.140 
that was a warning so far I guessed
right<00:03:23.750> it's<00:03:24.709> fixed<00:03:25.040> now<00:03:25.430> it's<00:03:25.549> just<00:03:25.640> a<00:03:25.849> few

00:03:26.140 --> 00:03:26.150 
right it's fixed now it's just a few

00:03:26.150 --> 00:03:27.580 
right it's fixed now it's just a few
little<00:03:26.209> maintenance<00:03:26.629> items<00:03:26.959> like<00:03:27.110> change<00:03:27.440> oil

00:03:27.580 --> 00:03:27.590 
little maintenance items like change oil

00:03:27.590 --> 00:03:30.309 
little maintenance items like change oil
air<00:03:28.099> the<00:03:28.250> tires<00:03:28.430> and<00:03:28.670> then<00:03:28.810> this<00:03:29.810> cars<00:03:30.110> out<00:03:30.290> of

00:03:30.309 --> 00:03:30.319 
air the tires and then this cars out of

00:03:30.319 --> 00:03:32.530 
air the tires and then this cars out of
here
