00:00:16.539 --> 00:00:19.380 
of them is good so all we need to do to
start<00:00:16.630> this<00:00:16.810> is<00:00:17.610> two<00:00:18.610> repeaters<00:00:19.000> just<00:00:19.270> like

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:19.390 
start this is two repeaters just like

00:00:19.390 --> 00:00:22.080 
start this is two repeaters just like
this<00:00:19.540> redstone<00:00:20.260> dust<00:00:20.650> on<00:00:21.040> either<00:00:21.550> side<00:00:21.880> and

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:22.090 
this redstone dust on either side and

00:00:22.090 --> 00:00:23.970 
this redstone dust on either side and
right<00:00:22.390> here<00:00:22.660> we're<00:00:23.290> going<00:00:23.380> to<00:00:23.470> put<00:00:23.590> average

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:23.980 
right here we're going to put average

00:00:23.980 --> 00:00:25.650 
right here we're going to put average
don't<00:00:24.190> torch<00:00:24.430> and<00:00:24.730> we're<00:00:24.850> going<00:00:25.000> to<00:00:25.030> break<00:00:25.420> it

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:25.660 
don't torch and we're going to break it

00:00:25.660 --> 00:00:27.480

and<00:00:25.810> put<00:00:26.200> a<00:00:26.230> dust<00:00:26.590> down<00:00:26.890> so<00:00:27.190> that<00:00:27.220> we<00:00:27.370> get

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:27.490 
and put a dust down so that we get

00:00:27.490 --> 00:00:29.670 
and put a dust down so that we get
infinite<00:00:28.090> I<00:00:28.330> think<00:00:28.900> it's<00:00:28.990> called<00:00:29.170> a<00:00:29.200> clock<00:00:29.470> I'm

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:29.680
