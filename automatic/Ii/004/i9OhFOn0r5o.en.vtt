Class D this thing only pulls about 300
watts<00:01:05.460> if<00:01:05.970> you<00:01:06.090> bridge<00:01:06.299> you<00:01:06.390> to<00:01:06.479> pull<00:01:06.630> home<00:01:06.780> so

00:01:07.039 --> 00:01:07.049 
watts if you bridge you to pull home so

00:01:07.049 --> 00:01:09.080 
watts if you bridge you to pull home so
done<00:01:07.799> full<00:01:07.979> having<00:01:08.310> any<00:01:08.430> power<00:01:08.640> compared<00:01:09.060> to

these o amps right here they pull like
1500<00:01:12.360> watts<00:01:12.479> each<00:01:12.720> so<00:01:13.170> you<00:01:13.229> need<00:01:13.409> separate

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:13.770 
1500 watts each so you need separate

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:15.609 
1500 watts each so you need separate
circuits<00:01:14.490> if<00:01:14.610> you<00:01:14.670> go<00:01:14.790> to<00:01:14.880> use<00:01:15.030> them<00:01:15.150> at<00:01:15.240> a<00:01:15.270> gig

00:01:15.609 --> 00:01:15.619

00:03:02.009 --> 00:03:02.019 
right here that has a little bit trying

00:03:02.019 --> 00:03:06.449 
right here that has a little bit trying
to<00:03:02.110> filter<00:03:02.260> through<00:03:02.500> so<00:03:04.950> the<00:03:05.950> bass<00:03:06.100> is<00:03:06.250> hitting

00:03:06.449 --> 00:03:06.459 
to filter through so the bass is hitting

to filter through so the bass is hitting
right<00:03:06.489> now<00:03:06.670> I'm<00:03:06.819> going<00:03:06.940> to<00:03:07.030> crank<00:03:07.209> it<00:03:07.239> up<00:03:07.329> a

00:03:07.380 --> 00:03:07.390 
right now I'm going to crank it up a

00:03:07.390 --> 00:03:34.350 
right now I'm going to crank it up a
little<00:03:07.540> bit

00:03:34.350 --> 00:03:34.360 

00:03:34.360 --> 00:03:37.840 

first<00:03:35.360> clip<00:03:35.569> was<00:03:35.690> with<00:03:35.840> my<00:03:36.020> subs<00:03:36.290> and<00:03:36.850> you

first clip was with my subs and you

00:03:37.850 --> 00:03:39.040

this<00:03:39.140> camera<00:03:39.319> because<00:03:39.560> the<00:03:39.650> bass<00:03:39.830> was<00:03:40.040> just

00:03:40.210 --> 00:03:40.220

under<00:05:30.680> some<00:05:30.800> more<00:05:30.949> tests<00:05:31.220> on<00:05:31.340> it<00:05:31.580> as<00:05:32.240> far<00:05:32.419> as

00:05:32.499 --> 00:05:32.509 
under some more tests on it as far as

00:05:32.509 --> 00:05:33.939 
under some more tests on it as far as
cranking<00:05:32.840> these<00:05:32.930> subs<00:05:33.169> and<00:05:33.410> see<00:05:33.470> how<00:05:33.590> long<00:05:33.800> I

00:05:33.939 --> 00:05:33.949 
cranking these subs and see how long I

00:05:33.949 --> 00:05:35.800 
cranking these subs and see how long I
could<00:05:34.009> how<00:05:34.340> hard<00:05:34.580> I<00:05:34.699> can<00:05:34.729> crank<00:05:35.030> it<00:05:35.180> before<00:05:35.780> I

00:05:35.800 --> 00:05:35.810 
could how hard I can crank it before I

00:05:35.810 --> 00:05:37.210 
could how hard I can crank it before I
have<00:05:35.930> a<00:05:35.990> problem<00:05:36.320> with<00:05:36.500> anything<00:05:36.680> shuts<00:05:37.009> down

00:05:55.330 --> 00:05:55.340 
cranking my subs for about maybe three

00:05:55.340 --> 00:05:57.760 
cranking my subs for about maybe three
minutes<00:05:55.520> hard<00:05:56.330> and<00:05:56.660> here<00:05:56.780> I<00:05:56.810> mean<00:05:56.990> walls<00:05:57.229> this

00:05:57.760 --> 00:05:57.770 
minutes hard and here I mean walls this

00:05:57.770 --> 00:05:59.499 
minutes hard and here I mean walls this
stuff<00:05:57.979> was<00:05:58.130> just<00:05:58.160> coming<00:05:58.550> down<00:05:58.699> I<00:05:58.940> know<00:05:59.330> my

00:05:59.499 --> 00:05:59.509 
stuff was just coming down I know my

00:05:59.509 --> 00:06:00.790 
stuff was just coming down I know my
neighbors<00:05:59.780> got<00:05:59.930> here<00:06:00.139> next<00:06:00.440> door

00:06:00.790 --> 00:06:00.800 
neighbors got here next door

00:06:00.800 --> 00:06:03.189 
neighbors got here next door
but<00:06:01.160> uh<00:06:01.190> I<00:06:01.639> cranked<00:06:02.479> up<00:06:02.539> about<00:06:02.599> three<00:06:02.990> or<00:06:03.050> four

00:06:03.189 --> 00:06:03.199 
but uh I cranked up about three or four

00:06:03.199 --> 00:06:05.290 
but uh I cranked up about three or four
minutes<00:06:03.500> hard<00:06:03.680> and<00:06:03.919> the<00:06:04.070> fan<00:06:04.340> does<00:06:04.699> rev<00:06:05.060> up

00:06:05.290 --> 00:06:05.300 
minutes hard and the fan does rev up

00:06:05.300 --> 00:06:06.760 
minutes hard and the fan does rev up
when<00:06:05.630> the<00:06:05.690> base<00:06:05.900> hits<00:06:06.229> real<00:06:06.470> hard<00:06:06.650> it<00:06:06.740> just

00:06:06.760 --> 00:06:06.770 
when the base hits real hard it just

00:06:06.770 --> 00:06:09.520 
when the base hits real hard it just
slowly<00:06:07.250> revs<00:06:08.090> up<00:06:08.479> but<00:06:08.930> then<00:06:09.050> when<00:06:09.199> you<00:06:09.259> turn<00:06:09.410> it

00:06:09.520 --> 00:06:09.530 
slowly revs up but then when you turn it

00:06:09.530 --> 00:06:13.150 
slowly revs up but then when you turn it
down<00:06:09.710> rev<00:06:10.340> slowly<00:06:10.820> down<00:06:11.120> but<00:06:11.960> so<00:06:12.680> fine<00:06:12.889> and<00:06:13.070> get

00:06:13.150 --> 00:06:13.160 
down rev slowly down but so fine and get

00:06:13.160 --> 00:06:15.640 
down rev slowly down but so fine and get
any<00:06:13.370> clipping<00:06:13.759> or<00:06:14.090> anything<00:06:14.500> it's<00:06:15.500> not

00:06:15.640 --> 00:06:15.650 
any clipping or anything it's not

00:06:15.650 --> 00:06:16.629 
any clipping or anything it's not
pulling<00:06:15.889> that<00:06:15.919> much<00:06:16.099> power<00:06:16.280> because<00:06:16.430> my

00:06:16.629 --> 00:06:16.639 
pulling that much power because my

00:06:16.639 --> 00:06:18.730 
pulling that much power because my
lights<00:06:17.030> in<00:06:17.210> the<00:06:17.270> ceiling<00:06:17.449> will<00:06:17.660> barely<00:06:17.840> use<00:06:18.560> if

00:06:18.730 --> 00:06:18.740 
lights in the ceiling will barely use if

00:06:18.740 --> 00:06:21.460 
lights in the ceiling will barely use if
I<00:06:18.830> crank<00:06:19.070> one<00:06:19.220> of<00:06:19.280> these<00:06:19.370> other<00:06:19.520> amps<00:06:20.260> on<00:06:21.260> base

00:06:21.460 --> 00:06:21.470 
I crank one of these other amps on base

00:06:21.470 --> 00:06:23.589 
I crank one of these other amps on base
in<00:06:21.500> here<00:06:21.860> my<00:06:22.250> lights<00:06:22.490> actually<00:06:22.789> linked<00:06:23.449> with

00:06:23.589 --> 00:06:23.599 
in here my lights actually linked with

00:06:23.599 --> 00:06:25.240 
in here my lights actually linked with
the<00:06:23.690> base<00:06:23.870> because<00:06:24.050> only<00:06:24.320> 15<00:06:24.770> or<00:06:24.800> 20<00:06:25.130> amp

00:06:25.240 --> 00:06:25.250 
the base because only 15 or 20 amp

circuits<00:06:25.610> this<00:06:26.090> one<00:06:26.330> cranked<00:06:26.690> it<00:06:26.720> up<00:06:26.860> lights

00:06:27.850 --> 00:06:27.860 
circuits this one cranked it up lights

00:06:27.860 --> 00:06:30.070 
circuits this one cranked it up lights
it<00:06:28.070> even<00:06:28.310> dim<00:06:28.490> so<00:06:29.330> let<00:06:29.750> you<00:06:29.840> know<00:06:29.930> is<00:06:29.990> only

00:06:30.070 --> 00:06:30.080 
it even dim so let you know is only

00:06:30.080 --> 00:06:31.540 
it even dim so let you know is only
pulling<00:06:30.349> like<00:06:30.590> three<00:06:30.949> hundred<00:06:31.220> and<00:06:31.280> sixty

00:06:31.540 --> 00:06:31.550 
pulling like three hundred and sixty

00:06:31.550 --> 00:06:33.879 
pulling like three hundred and sixty
watts<00:06:31.760> max<00:06:31.909> and<00:06:32.389> 4<00:06:32.599> ohms<00:06:32.750> so<00:06:33.620> this<00:06:33.740> thing

00:06:33.879 --> 00:06:33.889 
watts max and 4 ohms so this thing

00:06:33.889 --> 00:06:34.870 
watts max and 4 ohms so this thing
doesn't<00:06:34.070> seem<00:06:34.250> like<00:06:34.370> it's<00:06:34.460> doing<00:06:34.580> pretty<00:06:34.639> good

00:06:34.870 --> 00:06:34.880 
doesn't seem like it's doing pretty good

00:06:34.880 --> 00:06:37.629 
doesn't seem like it's doing pretty good
I<00:06:34.940> want<00:06:35.210> to<00:06:35.270> thank<00:06:35.530> that<00:06:36.530> tally<00:06:36.800> with<00:06:37.220> on<00:06:37.340> fire
