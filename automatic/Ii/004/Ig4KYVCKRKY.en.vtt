00:00:07.509 --> 00:00:13.869
 hello girls because today I come with a video 

00:00:10.629 --> 00:00:16.720
 new that the video is to prepare the 

00:00:13.869 --> 00:00:19.510
 new acrylic brush is the first 

00:00:16.720 --> 00:00:23.349
 time I do it since we paint brushes 

00:00:19.510 --> 00:00:25.840
 of acrylic that I have had is not used do 

00:00:23.349 --> 00:00:27.460
 fatal because I did not know how to take care of them or 

00:00:25.840 --> 00:00:31.000
 how to use them because I'm starting 

00:00:27.460 --> 00:00:32.320
 so now what I'm going to teach you is 

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:35.079
 what I have learned seeing others 

00:00:32.320 --> 00:00:37.030
 videos and well then since I do it 

00:00:35.079 --> 00:00:38.370
 I teach how I do it, look how 

00:00:37.030 --> 00:00:40.600
 first of all it is to take off the hood 

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:42.879
 I understand that it is not good 

00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:46.059
 save them with a hood because if you 

00:00:42.879 --> 00:00:47.889
 you keep humid then the brush has and 

00:00:46.059 --> 00:00:51.100
 retained moisture and is not good for 

00:00:47.889 --> 00:00:53.739
 the hair so that's why we take the 

00:00:51.100 --> 00:00:55.120
 hood and we do not use it again 

00:00:53.739 --> 00:00:56.859
 that what is good is to put it in the 

00:00:55.120 --> 00:00:59.139
 tubes these once it has dried what 

00:00:56.859 --> 00:01:01.929
 we put here and it is already protected in the 

00:00:59.139 --> 00:01:03.339
 tube is good for the other hood as 

00:01:01.929 --> 00:01:05.260
 What do you want? I 'm not going to 

00:01:03.339 --> 00:01:08.170
 use vale the first thing that you have to 

00:01:05.260 --> 00:01:09.909
 to do is to catch what is the tip if 

00:01:08.170 --> 00:01:12.550
 take an encore of the new you will see that it is 

00:01:09.909 --> 00:01:13.590
 super hard is this is that in the 

00:01:12.550 --> 00:01:15.899
 process 

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:18.210
 It is very hard because the first thing 

00:01:15.899 --> 00:01:21.979
 what to do is crush your fingers 

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:25.560
 a little the bristles of the brush is worth going 

00:01:21.979 --> 00:01:28.319
 softening the little hairs well with 

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:31.380
 softness to remove dust that has 

00:01:28.319 --> 00:01:33.740
 could have been there in the manufacturing 

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:33.740
 dirt 

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:38.900
 All the product that you have is worth 

00:01:40.820 --> 00:01:47.990
 It is worth once the brush is ready 

00:01:44.409 --> 00:01:51.979
 with separate cells and so 

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:53.810
 let's see that it is already well loose 

00:01:51.979 --> 00:01:56.180
 so let's throw acrylic ideas 

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:59.270
 have my low-odor acrylic already 

00:01:56.180 --> 00:02:02.660
 I'll tell if it smells little that's worth it so 

00:01:59.270 --> 00:02:03.740
 we throw the here and with a glass but already 

00:02:02.660 --> 00:02:06.020
 I was going to throw him out and he talked 

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:08.270
 it's still worth what I 've read is that there 

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:11.660
 that throw the acrylic and that is falling 

00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:14.090
 in the brush it's worth the bristles so 

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:17.130
 separating the go and they go poking 

00:02:14.090 --> 00:02:19.020
 little by little, that's what we're going to do 

00:02:17.130 --> 00:02:21.600
 let's take you acrylic on 

00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:26.120
 brush let's throw it and go 

00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:26.120
 already falling in our container 

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:33.180
 well, slowly we are going 

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:33.180
 very well 

00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:40.420
 and now that our brush has been 

00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:42.700
 moistened little by little we wet it inside 

00:02:40.420 --> 00:02:45.340
 ok let's go down also gently 

00:02:42.700 --> 00:02:50.380
 to the puppies what I really want 

00:02:45.340 --> 00:02:52.930
 that foreigners have treated fatal 

00:02:50.380 --> 00:02:56.260
 ok then we crush it so little to 

00:02:52.930 --> 00:02:59.050
 little and we are drying our in our 

00:02:56.260 --> 00:03:02.310
 paper is good so all the sows are 

00:02:59.050 --> 00:03:02.310
 impregnated with the liquid 

00:03:02.840 --> 00:03:06.500
 and that is also taking form 

00:03:04.849 --> 00:03:08.000
 our brush 

00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:09.880
 and it is with such is the first time that what 

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:12.410
 I'm going to use at the moment it looks good 

00:03:09.880 --> 00:03:16.070
 we'll see later when I do the design 

00:03:12.410 --> 00:03:18.770
 I can tell you that the monomer smells 

00:03:16.070 --> 00:03:20.620
 very much much less than the other 

00:03:18.770 --> 00:03:22.420
 monomer he 

00:03:20.620 --> 00:03:25.780
 yes it is true that it also has a smell 

00:03:22.420 --> 00:03:28.720
 but very much much less smell 

00:03:25.780 --> 00:03:30.250
 it's a bit like for example the smell 

00:03:28.720 --> 00:03:32.950
 of acetone or lava so it's a bit 

00:03:30.250 --> 00:03:34.240
 strong but it is bearable because it is 

00:03:32.950 --> 00:03:37.480
 same 

00:03:34.240 --> 00:03:41.110
 even less annoying I think it's worth it 

00:03:37.480 --> 00:03:43.410
 that we are wetting the brush and drying the 

00:03:41.110 --> 00:03:43.410
 napkin 

00:03:43.760 --> 00:03:48.890
 it is very important not to do so with the 

00:03:46.610 --> 00:03:52.490
 brush and to cure it is worth it 

00:03:48.890 --> 00:03:54.230
 we wet one side to the other side 

00:03:52.490 --> 00:03:56.480
 but it does not do everything at once so you do not 

00:03:54.230 --> 00:03:58.670
 it spoils us, it's worth nothing in 

00:03:56.480 --> 00:04:00.680
 our brush would be ready 

00:03:58.670 --> 00:04:05.450
 prepared we could leave it like this already 

00:04:00.680 --> 00:04:07.730
 let it dry and use it when 

00:04:05.450 --> 00:04:09.110
 we want when it has dried or if 

00:04:07.730 --> 00:04:10.610
 we are going to make a design because 

00:04:09.110 --> 00:04:14.390
 can use is supposed to be already 

00:04:10.610 --> 00:04:18.070
 prepared is worth nothing we see in 

00:04:14.390 --> 00:04:18.070
 another video goodbye
