now<00:00:05.580> that<00:00:05.760> you<00:00:05.850> have<00:00:05.880> your<00:00:06.120> samples<00:00:06.600> and<00:00:06.750> their

00:00:06.830 --> 00:00:06.840 
now that you have your samples and their

00:00:06.840 --> 00:00:08.990 
now that you have your samples and their
individual<00:00:07.320> label<00:00:07.800> tubes<00:00:08.100> ready<00:00:08.640> to<00:00:08.850> begin

individual label tubes ready to begin
with<00:00:09.480> the<00:00:09.600> extraction<00:00:09.990> what<00:00:10.770> we'll<00:00:10.889> need<00:00:11.010> to

00:00:11.150 --> 00:00:11.160 
with the extraction what we'll need to

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:13.460 
with the extraction what we'll need to
do<00:00:11.280> is<00:00:11.430> add<00:00:11.610> 100<00:00:12.240> microliters<00:00:12.570> of<00:00:12.840> the<00:00:13.140> nuclei

00:00:13.460 --> 00:00:13.470 
do is add 100 microliters of the nuclei

00:00:13.470 --> 00:00:15.080 
do is add 100 microliters of the nuclei
lysis<00:00:13.860> solution<00:00:14.250> so<00:00:14.400> I'm<00:00:14.490> going<00:00:14.640> to<00:00:14.700> use<00:00:14.850> my

00:00:15.080 --> 00:00:15.090 
lysis solution so I'm going to use my

00:00:15.090 --> 00:00:18.200 
lysis solution so I'm going to use my
blue<00:00:15.300> pipette<00:00:15.920> set<00:00:16.920> to<00:00:17.070> 100<00:00:17.460> microliters<00:00:17.760> and

blue pipette set to 100 microliters and
always<00:00:19.200> I<00:00:19.439> want<00:00:19.830> to<00:00:19.890> use<00:00:19.980> a<00:00:20.010> fresh<00:00:20.310> tip<00:00:21.210> to<00:00:22.079> add

00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:22.230 
always I want to use a fresh tip to add

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:24.620 
always I want to use a fresh tip to add
the<00:00:22.590> solution<00:00:23.040> every<00:00:23.279> time<00:00:23.490> my<00:00:24.239> lysis

00:00:24.620 --> 00:00:24.630

00:01:53.890 --> 00:01:53.900 

00:01:53.900 --> 00:01:56.380 

once<00:01:54.770> you've<00:01:54.980> added<00:01:55.220> it<00:01:55.490> to<00:01:55.520> the<00:01:55.700> tube<00:01:55.970> you

00:01:56.380 --> 00:01:56.390 
once you've added it to the tube you

00:01:56.390 --> 00:01:58.600 
once you've added it to the tube you
want<00:01:56.570> to<00:01:56.660> shake<00:01:56.870> the<00:01:57.020> tube<00:01:57.200> and<00:01:57.440> then<00:01:57.980> place<00:01:58.370> it
