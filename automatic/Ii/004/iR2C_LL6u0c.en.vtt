00:01:50.399 --> 00:01:53.179 
just so realistic and she has a stripe
on<00:01:50.700> the<00:01:51.299> uniforms<00:01:51.840> that<00:01:51.960> they<00:01:52.049> have<00:01:52.200> and<00:01:52.409> her

00:01:53.179 --> 00:01:53.189 
on the uniforms that they have and her

00:01:53.189 --> 00:01:54.859 
on the uniforms that they have and her
skirt<00:01:53.490> is<00:01:53.640> actually<00:01:54.030> cloth<00:01:54.270> if<00:01:54.450> you<00:01:54.540> can<00:01:54.659> see

00:01:54.859 --> 00:01:54.869 
skirt is actually cloth if you can see

00:01:54.869 --> 00:01:58.160 
skirt is actually cloth if you can see
and<00:01:55.700> it's<00:01:56.700> sort<00:01:56.909> of<00:01:56.939> like<00:01:57.060> a<00:01:57.119> pleat<00:01:57.390> skirt<00:01:57.719> like

00:01:58.160 --> 00:01:58.170 
and it's sort of like a pleat skirt like

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:00.050 
and it's sort of like a pleat skirt like
in<00:01:58.290> the<00:01:58.380> front<00:01:58.530> probably<00:01:59.460> you<00:01:59.640> probably<00:01:59.670> don't

00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:00.060 
in the front probably you probably don't

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:01.760 
in the front probably you probably don't
know<00:02:00.180> what<00:02:00.210> that<00:02:00.450> means<00:02:00.659> here<00:02:01.020> you<00:02:01.320> guys<00:02:01.469> um

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:01.770 
know what that means here you guys um

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:03.319 
know what that means here you guys um
unless<00:02:02.159> girls<00:02:02.700> are<00:02:02.820> watching<00:02:03.180> this<00:02:03.270> you

00:02:03.319 --> 00:02:03.329 
unless girls are watching this you

00:02:03.329 --> 00:02:04.340 
unless girls are watching this you
probably<00:02:03.450> know<00:02:03.780> what<00:02:03.899> it<00:02:03.960> means

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:04.350 
probably know what it means

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:07.609 
probably know what it means
anyway<00:02:05.180> so<00:02:06.180> she<00:02:06.329> has<00:02:06.509> a<00:02:06.540> cloth<00:02:06.840> skirt<00:02:07.229> and<00:02:07.439> I

00:02:07.609 --> 00:02:07.619 
anyway so she has a cloth skirt and I

00:02:07.619 --> 00:02:08.869 
anyway so she has a cloth skirt and I
think<00:02:07.799> this<00:02:07.950> carries<00:02:08.250> a<00:02:08.310> little<00:02:08.459> bit<00:02:08.670> longer

00:02:08.869 --> 00:02:08.879 
think this carries a little bit longer

00:02:08.879 --> 00:02:10.910 
think this carries a little bit longer
than<00:02:09.179> it<00:02:09.209> should<00:02:09.330> be<00:02:09.629> like<00:02:10.289> in<00:02:10.500> the<00:02:10.590> movies

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:10.920 
than it should be like in the movies

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:13.309 
than it should be like in the movies
they're<00:02:11.129> shorter<00:02:11.550> and<00:02:12.200> her

00:02:13.309 --> 00:02:13.319 
they're shorter and her

00:02:13.319 --> 00:02:16.399 
they're shorter and her
shoes<00:02:13.560> look<00:02:14.150> totally<00:02:15.150> like<00:02:15.420> the<00:02:15.870> shoes<00:02:16.109> in<00:02:16.379> the

00:02:16.399 --> 00:02:16.409 
shoes look totally like the shoes in the

00:02:16.409 --> 00:02:18.470 
shoes look totally like the shoes in the
movie<00:02:16.799> I<00:02:17.040> think<00:02:17.249> they<00:02:17.549> did<00:02:17.700> a<00:02:17.730> great<00:02:17.909> job<00:02:18.030> on

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:18.480 
movie I think they did a great job on

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:21.110 
movie I think they did a great job on
that<00:02:18.510> and<00:02:18.989> she<00:02:19.829> has<00:02:19.950> great<00:02:20.099> articulation<00:02:20.430> and

00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:21.120 
that and she has great articulation and

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:22.849 
that and she has great articulation and
the<00:02:21.480> things<00:02:21.659> I<00:02:21.840> don't<00:02:21.900> like<00:02:22.379> about<00:02:22.530> her<00:02:22.739> I

00:02:22.849 --> 00:02:22.859 
the things I don't like about her I

00:02:22.859 --> 00:02:25.640 
the things I don't like about her I
don't<00:02:22.980> like<00:02:23.129> how<00:02:23.400> it<00:02:23.519> hurt<00:02:23.730> um<00:02:24.090> her<00:02:24.870> torso

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:25.650 
don't like how it hurt um her torso

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:28.699 
don't like how it hurt um her torso
right<00:02:26.069> here<00:02:26.400> um<00:02:26.999> it<00:02:27.239> looks<00:02:27.420> too<00:02:27.689> wide<00:02:28.290> and<00:02:28.680> just

00:02:28.699 --> 00:02:28.709 
right here um it looks too wide and just

00:02:28.709 --> 00:02:31.610 
right here um it looks too wide and just
not<00:02:29.129> like<00:02:29.519> what<00:02:30.420> a<00:02:30.450> real<00:02:30.810> person<00:02:31.319> would<00:02:31.469> look

00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:31.620 
not like what a real person would look

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:33.649 
not like what a real person would look
like<00:02:31.799> I<00:02:31.980> don't<00:02:32.040> know<00:02:32.250> I<00:02:32.489> just<00:02:32.849> think<00:02:33.030> it<00:02:33.120> goes

00:02:33.649 --> 00:02:33.659 
like I don't know I just think it goes

00:02:33.659 --> 00:02:34.970 
like I don't know I just think it goes
out<00:02:33.930> a<00:02:33.959> little<00:02:34.139> bit<00:02:34.379> too<00:02:34.500> much<00:02:34.650> I<00:02:34.739> think<00:02:34.829> they

00:02:34.970 --> 00:02:34.980 
out a little bit too much I think they

00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:35.750 
out a little bit too much I think they
should<00:02:35.129> let<00:02:35.189> me<00:02:35.310> hit<00:02:35.400> her<00:02:35.459> like<00:02:35.609> a<00:02:35.639> little

00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:35.760 
should let me hit her like a little

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:41.119 
should let me hit her like a little
thinner<00:02:36.709> and<00:02:39.019> I'll<00:02:40.019> end<00:02:40.290> your<00:02:40.620> skirt<00:02:40.889> I<00:02:40.950> don't

00:02:41.119 --> 00:02:41.129 
thinner and I'll end your skirt I don't

00:02:41.129 --> 00:02:42.619 
thinner and I'll end your skirt I don't
like<00:02:41.219> her<00:02:41.310> her<00:02:41.639> skirt<00:02:41.969> is<00:02:42.150> a<00:02:42.180> little<00:02:42.540> bit

00:02:42.619 --> 00:02:42.629 
like her her skirt is a little bit

00:02:42.629 --> 00:02:45.110 
like her her skirt is a little bit
longer<00:02:42.870> but<00:02:43.560> besides<00:02:44.010> that<00:02:44.310> I<00:02:44.340> think<00:02:44.549> that<00:02:44.909> she

00:02:45.110 --> 00:02:45.120 
longer but besides that I think that she

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:47.149 
longer but besides that I think that she
is<00:02:45.329> just<00:02:45.359> an<00:02:45.719> awesome<00:02:45.959> figure<00:02:46.379> and<00:02:46.709> I<00:02:46.739> totally
