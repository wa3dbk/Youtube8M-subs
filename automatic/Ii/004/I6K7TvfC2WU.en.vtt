00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:40.880
 the color of the car that matches this 

00:00:38.080 --> 00:00:43.520

00:00:59.360 --> 00:01:04.400
 I had no future and I'm still in the same 

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:06.890
 way knowing the world 

00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:07.729
 If it's to play well and get tattoos 

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:09.920
 journey 

00:01:07.729 --> 00:01:12.200
 I do not follow rules because rules about 

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:14.060

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:16.729

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:27.890
 disputing streak then paid paulo and today 

00:01:25.430 --> 00:01:31.399

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:46.100

00:01:55.480 --> 00:02:09.009
 that opens the way that arrived my turn 

00:01:58.240 --> 00:02:10.090
 If it were a game 7 a chess game is 

00:02:09.009 --> 00:02:11.950

00:02:11.950 --> 00:02:16.570
 the new vectra gls year and model 94 makes 

00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:18.430
 It's been a while since I've had this car. 

00:02:16.570 --> 00:02:19.600
 despite what a lot of people talk about it is a 

00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:22.720
 very good car 

00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:24.160
 liked to ride great motor great 

00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:25.989
 dirigibility 

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:27.310
 little by little I'm leaving him like me 

00:02:25.989 --> 00:02:29.860
 really like 

00:02:27.310 --> 00:02:32.170
 at the moment he has to make repair of 

00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:34.390
 painter on the front bumper in a 

00:02:32.170 --> 00:02:35.470
 general catalog on brasserie really 

00:02:34.390 --> 00:02:38.739
 little thing 

00:02:35.470 --> 00:02:41.440
 the sound is provisional and a sound that equates 

00:02:38.739 --> 00:02:43.780
 a cut I had I went through this 

00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:46.510
 car just to really enjoy 

00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:49.450
 are two magnus and rex 800 rms each 

00:02:46.510 --> 00:02:53.260
 four bugles and rms every two tweeters 

00:02:49.450 --> 00:02:55.390
 crms every two modules can be 840 and 

00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:56.500
 inside here as you could see 

00:02:55.390 --> 00:02:59.440
 on video 

00:02:56.500 --> 00:03:02.440
 I have a retractable screen dvd screen 

00:02:59.440 --> 00:03:05.709
 a 7-inch playstation 2 and a 

00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:08.370
 inverter that was hidden in the 

00:03:05.709 --> 00:03:15.150
 panel and so it does not appear in the video 

00:03:08.370 --> 00:03:15.150
 to turn on 112 and 

00:03:15.570 --> 00:03:21.340
 17-wheeler wheels and 

00:03:17.890 --> 00:03:23.560
 tires 215 40 17 

00:03:21.340 --> 00:03:25.780
 I still want to handle the suspension only. 

00:03:23.560 --> 00:03:28.120
 not yet decide whether to put the 

00:03:25.780 --> 00:03:30.280
 fixed to the organ understood why it is 

00:03:28.120 --> 00:03:34.060
 complicated for me to lay down for 

00:03:30.280 --> 00:03:38.700
 garages in a car now enters a 

00:03:34.060 --> 00:03:38.700
 very large ramp despite the Celtic car 

00:03:38.790 --> 00:03:42.269
 This is it people 

00:03:42.360 --> 00:03:49.000
 I did not like it, share the video there. 

00:03:45.820 --> 00:03:53.769
 that you have liked opinions with 

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:56.950
 certainty will be critical is normal only that 

00:03:53.769 --> 00:03:58.989
 for me to leave naked is not after life 

00:03:56.950 --> 00:04:01.680
 policy is constructive 

00:03:58.989 --> 00:04:09.500
 So tell me what you need to talk about there. 

00:04:01.680 --> 00:04:09.500
 and stayed in the galera arm and sentinel
