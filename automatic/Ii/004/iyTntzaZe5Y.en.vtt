00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.300
 good morning welcome and welcome to 

00:00:01.770 --> 00:00:04.560
 a new video of books to read in 

00:00:03.300 --> 00:00:07.020
 this case I will talk about the books 

00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:09.030
 of the month of January 2015 in the 

00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:11.700
 Well, I'll tell you the best and 

00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:14.680
 the worst reading of this month and it's already 

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:17.680
 it's worth inside 

00:00:14.680 --> 00:00:20.380
 and 

00:00:17.680 --> 00:00:22.600
 and first of all I tell you that below you 

00:00:20.380 --> 00:00:24.310
 I leave the links to the blog and aritz with the 

00:00:22.600 --> 00:00:25.450
 corresponding reviews to the books 

00:00:24.310 --> 00:00:27.220
 that I am going to teach you so you can 

00:00:25.450 --> 00:00:28.960
 take a look and well then comment 

00:00:27.220 --> 00:00:30.850
 a little to see what you think of as the 

00:00:28.960 --> 00:00:32.260
 review that you have found the novel in 

00:00:30.850 --> 00:00:33.790
 case that you have read though also 

00:00:32.260 --> 00:00:36.010
 you can comment here in the video the month 

00:00:33.790 --> 00:00:37.600
 past the best book was from choice 

00:00:36.010 --> 00:00:39.700
 of Caracas and in this case his second 

00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:41.710
 part of the lead continues with this 

00:00:39.700 --> 00:00:43.660
 best book position of the month in this 

00:00:41.710 --> 00:00:44.949
 case well and had expectations maybe 

00:00:43.660 --> 00:00:46.480
 a little bit taller than with 

00:00:44.949 --> 00:00:47.890
 selection because it is no longer that people 

00:00:46.480 --> 00:00:50.739
 he would have told me that it was a very good saga 

00:00:47.890 --> 00:00:52.570
 or very good book but apart from everything 

00:00:50.739 --> 00:00:54.340
 the hype I had from other people with 

00:00:52.570 --> 00:00:55.930
 since election the ribbon remained very 

00:00:54.340 --> 00:00:57.579
 high as for a second part 

00:00:55.930 --> 00:00:59.800
 was at the height therefore with 

00:00:57.579 --> 00:01:01.000
 delete I was in a dilemma post 

00:00:59.800 --> 00:01:03.489
 that is to go from milk I had liked 

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:05.080
 so much skin and I had to like it so much 

00:01:03.489 --> 00:01:06.220
 so that the saga was in a good 

00:01:05.080 --> 00:01:08.050
 level because in the event that I 

00:01:06.220 --> 00:01:11.950
 disappoints I know enough I think of 

00:01:08.050 --> 00:01:14.140
 selection to evaluate and its value 

00:01:11.950 --> 00:01:15.970
 let's say somehow and therefore not 

00:01:14.140 --> 00:01:18.130
 I would continue with the saga with so much strength 

00:01:15.970 --> 00:01:19.720
 come on that in the end or I'm saying 

00:01:18.130 --> 00:01:22.880
 that of him and you had very expectations 

00:01:19.720 --> 00:01:24.890
 high and he got out of trouble 

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:26.180
 is generally worth up to the book of 

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:27.619
 put also five stars as of 

00:01:26.180 --> 00:01:29.299
 selection that I will leave the link below 

00:01:27.619 --> 00:01:31.970
 so you can see the rap and it was a 

00:01:29.299 --> 00:01:33.409
 novel to which I put two thousand 577 thousand 

00:01:31.970 --> 00:01:35.960
 two hundred post-its because basically 

00:01:33.409 --> 00:01:38.149
 they did not stop happening things did not stop 

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:40.039
 of happening twists in the plot that are 

00:01:38.149 --> 00:01:41.689
 a lot better wonderful turns 

00:01:40.039 --> 00:01:43.579
 than the selection which shows that 

00:01:41.689 --> 00:01:45.259
 Caracas can build a saga with 

00:01:43.579 --> 00:01:46.490
 some characters and some pretty plots 

00:01:45.259 --> 00:01:48.140
 deeper than they seem to the 

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:49.939
 beginning so I was surprised by 

00:01:48.140 --> 00:01:51.409
 several reasons for the just for the 

00:01:49.939 --> 00:01:53.539
 characters for being deeper and 

00:01:51.409 --> 00:01:55.490
 show that not everything is what it seems and 

00:01:53.539 --> 00:01:56.899
 by also as you want home part of what 

00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:58.580
 that I felt then the plot of the novel 

00:01:56.899 --> 00:02:00.590
 we can discover little by little what 

00:01:58.580 --> 00:02:04.099
 that he does read exactly who he was and read 

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:06.380
 we go the country where Iraq lives to the 

00:02:04.099 --> 00:02:07.819
 country where the protagonist lives and thus 

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:09.619
 we can discover a bit then 

00:02:07.819 --> 00:02:11.450
 to the point at which the 

00:02:09.619 --> 00:02:13.519
 society and why it is very interesting 

00:02:11.450 --> 00:02:15.739
 It is very well carried out the 

00:02:13.519 --> 00:02:17.480
 twists in the plot are wonderful are 

00:02:15.739 --> 00:02:19.670
 that's why I had to put 5 

00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:21.650
 stars was my best reading of the month 

00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:23.510
 January that's why the plot is here 

00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:25.160
 because I did not expect anything at all 

00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:27.260
 of what happened and I did not expect the 

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:28.760
 final I did not expect him to leave that 

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:29.480
 line open for the next book and 

00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:32.090
 really 

00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:33.620
 dione everyone tells me that he's still not 

00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:36.290
 is to follow the line that is the best 

00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:37.909
 it's amazing how it really is like this I think 

00:02:36.290 --> 00:02:40.220
 that is going to be one of my trilogies 

00:02:37.909 --> 00:02:42.200
 favorite without a doubt against the worst 

00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:43.640
 book of the month I will tell you nothing a 

00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:45.409
 couple of little things because I do not have 

00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:47.090
 a lot to tell and I told everything in the 

00:02:45.409 --> 00:02:49.040
 review of the blog that as I told you 

00:02:47.090 --> 00:02:50.599
 I leave below the person of the month it comes 

00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:52.310
 of just one desire for solar gas is a 

00:02:50.599 --> 00:02:53.810
 novel that I acquired in ebook 

00:02:52.310 --> 00:02:55.819
 I'm sorry for this light that was just 

00:02:53.810 --> 00:02:57.410
 go down but there are many clouds and well 

00:02:55.819 --> 00:02:59.569
 the light changes only one desire is one 

00:02:57.410 --> 00:03:01.730
 Novel is not a good cloud if it is a novel 

00:02:59.569 --> 00:03:04.099
 short vouchers roll super short story is 

00:03:01.730 --> 00:03:06.349
 a story a little crazy but 

00:03:04.099 --> 00:03:08.260
 much sex sex that does not contribute anything to the 

00:03:06.349 --> 00:03:10.340
 plot with many song lyrics 

00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:11.900
 basically like a little to fill 

00:03:10.340 --> 00:03:13.459
 the space because it cost me one euro 

00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:16.310
 because if I really buy 

00:03:13.459 --> 00:03:18.620
 for a higher price in plan 45 euros a 

00:03:16.310 --> 00:03:21.079
 short novel where most of the time 

00:03:18.620 --> 00:03:23.810
 the protagonists go fucking or they 

00:03:21.079 --> 00:03:26.569
 they put extracts of songs that I do not 

00:03:23.810 --> 00:03:28.730
 they matter a lot, it 's like what you do 

00:03:26.569 --> 00:03:31.459
 charging me this money for this so 

00:03:28.730 --> 00:03:33.799
 in short, only one desire is a one 

00:03:31.459 --> 00:03:35.239
 I tell a short story however I want 

00:03:33.799 --> 00:03:37.579
 call that the truth is that it is 

00:03:35.239 --> 00:03:39.169
 entertaining you spend your time then 

00:03:37.579 --> 00:03:40.519
 it's fine there's already a reading that happens 

00:03:39.169 --> 00:03:43.250
 without grief or glory but of course he has 

00:03:40.519 --> 00:03:45.530
 been the worst book or a short novel of the 

00:03:43.250 --> 00:03:47.540
 month of January because then it has been without more 

00:03:45.530 --> 00:03:50.180
 and it is as yet olga salar 

00:03:47.540 --> 00:03:53.030
 have something that I do not know what it is but I 

00:03:50.180 --> 00:03:54.950
 like and seaweed salt because I like it and 

00:03:53.030 --> 00:03:56.329
 it's like it writes so I'll keep 

00:03:54.950 --> 00:03:58.010
 reading his novels I will continue reading his 

00:03:56.329 --> 00:03:59.660
 short novels or with everything that I 

00:03:58.010 --> 00:04:01.190
 I can do and I will comment on what 

00:03:59.660 --> 00:04:03.410
 Olga salar is appearing but 

00:04:01.190 --> 00:04:05.900
 basically I think what's wrong is 

00:04:03.410 --> 00:04:07.250
 as more depth not deeper than 

00:04:05.900 --> 00:04:09.139
 the story but maybe more preparation 

00:04:07.250 --> 00:04:10.819
 in history was in the stories have 

00:04:09.139 --> 00:04:12.530
 read this short story and another novel 

00:04:10.819 --> 00:04:14.419
 and I think both are missing as a 

00:04:12.530 --> 00:04:16.940
 light preparation with ones 

00:04:14.419 --> 00:04:18.229
 reasoning why this character 

00:04:16.940 --> 00:04:19.489
 is going to do this because this is 

00:04:18.229 --> 00:04:20.720
 happening all the authors go 

00:04:19.489 --> 00:04:22.729
 improving so I think things to the 

00:04:20.720 --> 00:04:25.340
 walked and I think I have nothing 

00:04:22.729 --> 00:04:27.320
 more than commenting that this has been all 

00:04:25.340 --> 00:04:30.320
 for today's video where I have spoken to you 

00:04:27.320 --> 00:04:32.300
 of elite and of only one desire and that I hope 

00:04:30.320 --> 00:04:33.500
 How good then you go through the links 

00:04:32.300 --> 00:04:35.120
 that I leave you below that as you know 

00:04:33.500 --> 00:04:36.889
 you can always find my networks 

00:04:35.120 --> 00:04:37.820
 social in the description box and 

00:04:36.889 --> 00:04:39.920
 nothing that we 're going 

00:04:37.820 --> 00:04:41.570
 in a new video I'm sorry I brought 

00:04:39.920 --> 00:04:43.100
 this video later than normal but 

00:04:41.570 --> 00:04:46.510
 well the world is against me 

00:04:43.100 --> 00:04:46.510
 thank you very much for seeing me and see you later
