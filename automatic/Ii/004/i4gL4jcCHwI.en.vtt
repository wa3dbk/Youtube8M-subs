00:00:11.480 --> 00:00:11.490 
the c220 is an old car

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:13.580 
the c220 is an old car
much<00:00:11.639> like<00:00:11.880> meryl<00:00:12.450> streep<00:00:12.599> because<00:00:13.110> it's<00:00:13.290> aged

00:00:13.580 --> 00:00:13.590 
much like meryl streep because it's aged

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:16.340 
much like meryl streep because it's aged
gracefully<00:00:14.280> and<00:00:14.880> is<00:00:15.870> awaiting<00:00:16.230> to<00:00:16.320> be

00:00:16.340 --> 00:00:16.350 
gracefully and is awaiting to be

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:17.720 
gracefully and is awaiting to be
replaced<00:00:16.740> by<00:00:16.890> the<00:00:16.949> newer<00:00:17.160> generation<00:00:17.670> of

00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:17.730 
replaced by the newer generation of

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:19.490 
replaced by the newer generation of
c-class<00:00:18.119> but<00:00:18.300> until<00:00:18.539> that<00:00:18.570> happens<00:00:18.690> it<00:00:19.260> goes

00:00:19.490 --> 00:00:19.500 
c-class but until that happens it goes

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:21.710 
c-class but until that happens it goes
up<00:00:19.740> against<00:00:20.189> the<00:00:20.340> whole<00:00:20.760> new<00:00:20.939> generation<00:00:21.119> of

00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:21.720 
up against the whole new generation of

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:27.640 
up against the whole new generation of
the<00:00:22.020> BMW<00:00:22.260> 3-series

00:00:27.640 --> 00:00:27.650 

00:00:27.650 --> 00:00:29.110 

which<00:00:27.920> is<00:00:28.040> like<00:00:28.190> Scarlett<00:00:28.580> Johansson<00:00:29.030> of

00:00:29.110 --> 00:00:29.120 
which is like Scarlett Johansson of

00:00:29.120 --> 00:00:31.150 
which is like Scarlett Johansson of
today<00:00:29.360> and<00:00:29.840> I<00:00:30.020> think<00:00:30.260> it<00:00:30.470> would<00:00:30.620> suffice<00:00:30.800> to

00:00:31.150 --> 00:00:31.160 
today and I think it would suffice to

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:32.710 
today and I think it would suffice to
say<00:00:31.190> just<00:00:31.580> this<00:00:31.880> for<00:00:32.210> the<00:00:32.300> rest<00:00:32.480> of<00:00:32.599> the

00:00:32.710 --> 00:00:32.720 
say just this for the rest of the

00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:34.540 
say just this for the rest of the
duration<00:00:33.080> of<00:00:33.140> a<00:00:33.260> video<00:00:33.560> but<00:00:33.740> hello<00:00:34.220> let's

best automatic transmission the DSG but

00:01:42.410 --> 00:01:44.290 
best automatic transmission the DSG but
as<00:01:42.530> you<00:01:42.679> see<00:01:42.890> there<00:01:43.069> is<00:01:43.160> no<00:01:43.250> DSG<00:01:43.789> lettering<00:01:44.149> on

cause it gets a multitronic CVT gearbox
and<00:01:49.300> slowly<00:01:50.300> and<00:01:50.569> eventually<00:01:51.050> you<00:01:51.200> start<00:01:51.440> to

00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:51.530 
and slowly and eventually you start to

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:53.680 
and slowly and eventually you start to
realize<00:01:51.950> why<00:01:52.220> this<00:01:52.280> car<00:01:52.789> is<00:01:52.970> the<00:01:53.149> cheapest<00:01:53.569> of

realize why this car is the cheapest of
the<00:01:53.780> lot<00:01:54.140> and<00:01:54.410> when<00:01:55.099> you<00:01:55.190> enter<00:01:55.429> the<00:01:55.520> cabin

00:01:55.719 --> 00:01:55.729 
the lot and when you enter the cabin

00:01:55.729 --> 00:01:58.240 
the lot and when you enter the cabin
with<00:01:56.179> the<00:01:56.300> same<00:01:56.479> thought<00:01:56.810> in<00:01:57.020> your<00:01:57.170> mind<00:01:57.440> it

00:01:58.240 --> 00:01:58.250 
with the same thought in your mind it

00:01:58.250 --> 00:01:59.859 
with the same thought in your mind it
now<00:01:58.580> starts<00:01:59.000> looking<00:01:59.330> like<00:01:59.569> something

00:01:59.859 --> 00:01:59.869 
now starts looking like something

00:01:59.869 --> 00:02:02.320 
now starts looking like something
designed<00:02:00.440> more<00:02:00.709> for<00:02:00.770> the<00:02:01.160> member<00:02:01.550> of<00:02:01.670> a<00:02:01.819> clergy

00:02:02.320 --> 00:02:02.330 
designed more for the member of a clergy

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:05.499 
designed more for the member of a clergy
and<00:02:03.160> hence<00:02:04.160> if<00:02:04.340> you<00:02:04.369> are<00:02:04.700> in<00:02:04.880> the<00:02:05.030> inside<00:02:05.479> of

00:02:05.499 --> 00:02:05.509 
and hence if you are in the inside of

00:02:05.509 --> 00:02:08.290 
and hence if you are in the inside of
the<00:02:05.899> a4<00:02:06.259> cabin<00:02:06.709> this<00:02:07.369> is<00:02:07.670> where<00:02:07.849> you<00:02:07.970> want<00:02:08.209> to

00:02:08.290 --> 00:02:08.300 
the a4 cabin this is where you want to

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:10.540 
the a4 cabin this is where you want to
be<00:02:08.479> chauffeured<00:02:09.380> around<00:02:09.470> by<00:02:09.770> someone<00:02:10.369> to

00:02:10.540 --> 00:02:10.550 
be chauffeured around by someone to

00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:12.520 
be chauffeured around by someone to
wherever<00:02:10.759> you<00:02:11.000> want<00:02:11.030> to<00:02:11.300> go<00:02:11.450> but<00:02:12.050> not<00:02:12.260> at<00:02:12.440> the

00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:12.530 
wherever you want to go but not at the

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:14.860 
wherever you want to go but not at the
steering<00:02:12.770> wheel<00:02:13.069> yourself<00:02:13.599> but<00:02:14.599> then<00:02:14.720> that

00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:14.870 
steering wheel yourself but then that

00:02:14.870 --> 00:02:16.390 
steering wheel yourself but then that
brings<00:02:15.050> us<00:02:15.319> to<00:02:15.470> the<00:02:15.560> question<00:02:15.709> as<00:02:16.099> to<00:02:16.130> which

00:02:16.390 --> 00:02:16.400 
brings us to the question as to which

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:18.580 
brings us to the question as to which
car<00:02:16.730> amongst<00:02:17.030> these<00:02:17.209> three<00:02:17.540> offer<00:02:17.780> the<00:02:18.440> best

00:02:18.580 --> 00:02:18.590 
car amongst these three offer the best

00:02:18.590 --> 00:02:20.710 
car amongst these three offer the best
comfort<00:02:19.010> and<00:02:19.160> space<00:02:19.520> here<00:02:20.030> at<00:02:20.209> the<00:02:20.330> back<00:02:20.480> and

00:02:20.710 --> 00:02:20.720 
comfort and space here at the back and

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:23.339 
comfort and space here at the back and
so<00:02:21.260> we<00:02:21.440> have<00:02:21.620> devised<00:02:22.280> a<00:02:22.550> new<00:02:22.819> way<00:02:23.060> a

00:02:23.339 --> 00:02:23.349 
so we have devised a new way a

00:02:23.349 --> 00:02:26.140 
so we have devised a new way a
scientific<00:02:24.349> way<00:02:24.590> to<00:02:24.800> compute<00:02:25.430> the<00:02:25.790> amount<00:02:25.940> of

00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:26.150 
scientific way to compute the amount of

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:29.050 
scientific way to compute the amount of
space<00:02:26.360> that<00:02:26.569> we<00:02:26.660> can<00:02:26.780> all<00:02:26.930> have<00:02:27.170> first<00:02:27.980> up<00:02:28.250> is<00:02:28.489> a

00:02:29.050 --> 00:02:29.060 
space that we can all have first up is a

00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:33.270 
space that we can all have first up is a
man<00:02:29.540> who<00:02:29.720> looks<00:02:29.900> much<00:02:30.140> like<00:02:30.380> a<00:02:30.410> penguin

00:02:33.270 --> 00:02:33.280 

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:36.940 

second<00:02:34.280> up<00:02:34.430> is<00:02:34.840> knee<00:02:35.840> nod<00:02:36.050> who<00:02:36.410> doesn't<00:02:36.800> have<00:02:36.860> a

00:02:36.940 --> 00:02:36.950 
second up is knee nod who doesn't have a

00:02:36.950 --> 00:02:38.560 
second up is knee nod who doesn't have a
lot<00:02:37.100> of<00:02:37.130> hair<00:02:37.460> on<00:02:37.490> his<00:02:37.760> head<00:02:37.790> and<00:02:38.000> so<00:02:38.360> should

00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:38.570 
lot of hair on his head and so should

00:02:38.570 --> 00:02:39.970 
lot of hair on his head and so should
ideally<00:02:38.930> be<00:02:39.020> getting<00:02:39.350> a<00:02:39.410> whole<00:02:39.590> lot<00:02:39.770> more

00:02:39.970 --> 00:02:39.980 
ideally be getting a whole lot more

00:02:39.980 --> 00:02:43.510 
ideally be getting a whole lot more
Headroom<00:02:41.080> third<00:02:42.080> up<00:02:42.290> is<00:02:42.530> own<00:02:42.950> car<00:02:43.340> who

00:02:43.510 --> 00:02:43.520 
Headroom third up is own car who

00:02:43.520 --> 00:02:45.010 
Headroom third up is own car who
compensates<00:02:44.120> for<00:02:44.210> the<00:02:44.360> lack<00:02:44.510> of<00:02:44.570> hair<00:02:44.900> that

00:02:45.010 --> 00:02:45.020 
compensates for the lack of hair that

00:02:45.020 --> 00:02:49.030 
compensates for the lack of hair that
need<00:02:45.170> not<00:02:45.350> have<00:02:46.120> and<00:02:47.410> that's<00:02:48.410> the<00:02:48.620> national
