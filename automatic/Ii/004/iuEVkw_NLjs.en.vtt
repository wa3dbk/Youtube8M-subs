and<00:01:24.869> when<00:01:25.020> they<00:01:25.080> come<00:01:25.229> out<00:01:25.320> with<00:01:25.409> a<00:01:25.470> new<00:01:25.710> design

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:26.040 
and when they come out with a new design

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:27.649 
and when they come out with a new design
it's<00:01:26.280> critical<00:01:26.759> that<00:01:26.909> they<00:01:27.150> have<00:01:27.299> worked<00:01:27.509> out

00:01:27.649 --> 00:01:27.659 
it's critical that they have worked out

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:29.359 
it's critical that they have worked out
all<00:01:27.869> the<00:01:28.020> manufacturing<00:01:28.680> issues<00:01:28.979> well<00:01:29.250> in

00:01:29.359 --> 00:01:29.369 
all the manufacturing issues well in

think that will clearly happen and I
