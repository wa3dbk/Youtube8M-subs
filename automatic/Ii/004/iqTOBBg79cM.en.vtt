are<00:01:48.210> identical<00:01:48.780> to<00:01:48.930> those<00:01:48.990> two<00:01:49.290> and<00:01:50.000> when<00:01:51.000> I<00:01:51.030> on

00:01:51.139 --> 00:01:51.149 
are identical to those two and when I on

are identical to those two and when I on
the<00:01:51.240> a<00:01:51.270> and<00:01:51.810> the<00:01:51.840> C<00:01:52.110> 200<00:01:52.680> and<00:01:53.420> you've<00:01:54.420> got<00:01:54.570> much

00:01:55.219 --> 00:01:55.229 
the a and the C 200 and you've got much

00:01:55.229 --> 00:01:57.830 
the a and the C 200 and you've got much
more<00:01:55.470> happening<00:01:55.710> on<00:01:55.979> the<00:01:56.100> front<00:01:56.310> panel<00:01:56.840> then

00:01:57.830 --> 00:01:57.840 
more happening on the front panel then

more happening on the front panel then
LCD<00:01:58.409> display<00:01:58.829> so<00:01:59.399> you<00:01:59.460> can<00:01:59.640> see<00:01:59.820> what's

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:00.030

and<00:02:01.450> you<00:02:02.259> have<00:02:04.350> buttons<00:02:05.350> on<00:02:05.500> the<00:02:05.560> front<00:02:05.590> panel

and you have buttons on the front panel

00:02:06.009 --> 00:02:08.790 
and you have buttons on the front panel
to<00:02:06.250> control<00:02:06.610> what's<00:02:06.850> happening<00:02:06.880> and<00:02:07.800> which

00:02:08.790 --> 00:02:08.800 
to control what's happening and which

00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:11.370 
to control what's happening and which
may<00:02:09.009> be<00:02:09.039> useful<00:02:09.310> if<00:02:09.759> the<00:02:10.149> remote<00:02:10.869> control<00:02:11.200> was

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:11.380 
may be useful if the remote control was

00:02:11.380 --> 00:02:14.520 
may be useful if the remote control was
messing<00:02:11.709> temporarily<00:02:12.450> because<00:02:13.450> with<00:02:14.380> the

messing temporarily because with the

smaller products you really need them

00:02:15.849 --> 00:02:18.509

00:02:53.699 --> 00:02:53.709 
and you do have four USB ports on the

00:02:53.709 --> 00:02:59.430 
and you do have four USB ports on the
c200<00:02:54.370> as<00:02:54.430> opposed<00:02:54.730> to<00:02:54.940> two<00:02:55.780> on<00:02:56.340> the<00:02:57.340> a<00:02:58.080> 282<00:02:59.080> 10

00:02:59.430 --> 00:02:59.440 
c200 as opposed to two on the a 282 10

00:02:59.440 --> 00:03:02.640 
c200 as opposed to two on the a 282 10
and<00:03:00.840> also<00:03:01.840> you'll<00:03:02.019> notice<00:03:02.140> there's<00:03:02.530> an

00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:02.650 
and also you'll notice there's an

00:03:02.650 --> 00:03:06.000 
and also you'll notice there's an
antenna<00:03:03.780> isn't<00:03:04.780> for<00:03:04.959> a<00:03:04.989> Wi-Fi<00:03:05.380> that<00:03:05.620> is<00:03:05.769> for

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:06.010 
antenna isn't for a Wi-Fi that is for

00:03:06.010 --> 00:03:10.800 
antenna isn't for a Wi-Fi that is for
the<00:03:06.040> RF<00:03:06.640> remote<00:03:07.570> control<00:03:08.079> and<00:03:09.390> so<00:03:10.390> this<00:03:10.510> remote

00:03:10.800 --> 00:03:10.810 
the RF remote control and so this remote

00:03:10.810 --> 00:03:12.599 
the RF remote control and so this remote
control<00:03:10.930> actually<00:03:11.440> operates<00:03:11.799> over<00:03:11.950> RF<00:03:12.400> which

00:03:12.599 --> 00:03:12.609 
control actually operates over RF which

00:03:12.609 --> 00:03:15.479 
control actually operates over RF which
is<00:03:12.840> slightly<00:03:13.840> more<00:03:14.290> convenient<00:03:14.829> than<00:03:15.010> the

00:03:15.479 --> 00:03:15.489 
is slightly more convenient than the

00:03:15.489 --> 00:03:19.680 
is slightly more convenient than the
usual<00:03:15.870> infrared<00:03:17.640> operation<00:03:18.640> of<00:03:19.060> the<00:03:19.209> standard

00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:19.690 
usual infrared operation of the standard

00:03:19.690 --> 00:03:24.390 
usual infrared operation of the standard
remote<00:03:19.810> control<00:03:21.930> so<00:03:23.069> there<00:03:24.069> are<00:03:24.100> the<00:03:24.220> members

00:03:24.390 --> 00:03:24.400 
remote control so there are the members

00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:27.330 
remote control so there are the members
of<00:03:24.549> the<00:03:24.850> popcorn<00:03:25.750> our<00:03:25.870> network<00:03:26.410> media<00:03:26.590> to<00:03:27.069> Fox

00:03:27.330 --> 00:03:27.340 
of the popcorn our network media to Fox

00:03:27.340 --> 00:03:30.870 
of the popcorn our network media to Fox
family<00:03:27.819> thank<00:03:28.720> you
