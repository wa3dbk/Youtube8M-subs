00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:33.600 
thing between of an apple that was

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:34.700 
thing between of an apple that was
really<00:01:33.840> nice<00:01:33.960> well<00:01:34.229> that<00:01:34.320> was<00:01:34.439> really<00:01:34.619> really

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:34.710 
really nice well that was really really

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:36.380 
really nice well that was really really
cool<00:01:34.950> or<00:01:35.130> not<00:01:35.220> I<00:01:35.340> felt<00:01:35.549> it<00:01:35.729> was<00:01:35.850> very<00:01:36.030> very<00:01:36.210> nice

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:36.390 
cool or not I felt it was very very nice

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:38.120 
cool or not I felt it was very very nice
smooth<00:01:37.020> in<00:01:37.229> there<00:01:37.409> as<00:01:37.530> well<00:01:37.560> I<00:01:37.710> think<00:01:37.979> it<00:01:38.040> was

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:38.130 
smooth in there as well I think it was

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:39.590 
smooth in there as well I think it was
something<00:01:38.310> really<00:01:38.490> cute<00:01:38.759> about<00:01:39.119> them<00:01:39.299> as<00:01:39.420> well

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:39.600 
something really cute about them as well

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:40.940 
something really cute about them as well
and<00:01:39.990> I<00:01:40.049> felt<00:01:40.229> like<00:01:40.350> it<00:01:40.439> was<00:01:40.530> pretty<00:01:40.680> nice

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:40.950 
and I felt like it was pretty nice

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:43.010 
and I felt like it was pretty nice
though<00:01:40.979> in<00:01:41.460> there<00:01:41.640> as<00:01:41.759> well<00:01:41.790> I<00:01:42.210> like<00:01:42.570> the<00:01:42.750> fact

00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:43.020 
though in there as well I like the fact

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:45.800 
though in there as well I like the fact
the<00:01:43.560> doctor<00:01:43.890> and<00:01:43.979> Clara's<00:01:44.659> relationship<00:01:45.659> is

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:47.120 
the doctor and Clara's relationship is
actually<00:01:46.140> looked<00:01:46.350> into<00:01:46.649> a<00:01:46.680> little<00:01:46.890> bit<00:01:46.979> more

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:47.130 
actually looked into a little bit more

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:49.580 
actually looked into a little bit more
like<00:01:47.310> Clara<00:01:48.110> questions<00:01:49.110> about<00:01:49.320> why<00:01:49.530> the

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:49.590

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:03.469 
spots and that and you'll also have a
little<00:02:02.579> bit<00:02:02.670> of<00:02:02.700> conflict<00:02:03.119> between<00:02:03.299> the

00:02:03.469 --> 00:02:03.479 
little bit of conflict between the

00:02:03.479 --> 00:02:05.240 
little bit of conflict between the
targets<00:02:03.990> and<00:02:04.140> flowers<00:02:04.439> I<00:02:04.560> found<00:02:04.770> that<00:02:04.890> quite<00:02:05.189> a

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:05.250 
targets and flowers I found that quite a

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:07.219 
targets and flowers I found that quite a
nice<00:02:05.520> because<00:02:05.820> there's<00:02:06.630> certain<00:02:06.899> points<00:02:07.110> why

00:02:07.219 --> 00:02:07.229 
nice because there's certain points why

00:02:07.229 --> 00:02:09.380 
nice because there's certain points why
the<00:02:07.290> TARDIS<00:02:07.890> doesn't<00:02:08.039> trust<00:02:08.429> clower<00:02:08.789> as<00:02:09.119> well

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:09.390 
the TARDIS doesn't trust clower as well

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:10.940 
the TARDIS doesn't trust clower as well
as<00:02:09.569> I'm<00:02:09.869> kind<00:02:10.200> of<00:02:10.229> like<00:02:10.349> really<00:02:10.560> neat<00:02:10.739> and

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:10.950 
as I'm kind of like really neat and

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:13.339 
as I'm kind of like really neat and
little<00:02:11.370> nice<00:02:11.550> though<00:02:11.790> as<00:02:11.910> well<00:02:12.090> to<00:02:12.480> me<00:02:12.660> I<00:02:12.690> did

00:02:13.339 --> 00:02:13.349 
little nice though as well to me I did

00:02:13.349 --> 00:02:13.760 
little nice though as well to me I did
feel

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:13.770 
feel

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:15.610 
feel
there<00:02:14.040> is<00:02:14.220> some<00:02:14.520> sort<00:02:14.760> of<00:02:14.790> element<00:02:15.000> of

00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:15.620 
there is some sort of element of

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:17.270 
there is some sort of element of
Ghostbusters<00:02:16.620> a<00:02:16.650> little<00:02:16.860> bit<00:02:16.980> they<00:02:17.100> did

00:02:17.270 --> 00:02:17.280 
Ghostbusters a little bit they did

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:18.470 
Ghostbusters a little bit they did
mention<00:02:17.520> that<00:02:17.670> at<00:02:17.880> the<00:02:17.970> beginning<00:02:18.120> of<00:02:18.360> the

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:18.480 
mention that at the beginning of the

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:20.990 
mention that at the beginning of the
episode<00:02:18.720> which<00:02:18.960> is<00:02:19.080> quite<00:02:19.260> nice<00:02:19.500> I<00:02:19.940> thought<00:02:20.940> I

00:02:20.990 --> 00:02:21.000 
episode which is quite nice I thought I

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:22.820 
episode which is quite nice I thought I
the<00:02:21.120> pace<00:02:21.450> of<00:02:21.720> the<00:02:21.870> episode<00:02:22.200> was<00:02:22.350> just<00:02:22.560> right

00:02:22.820 --> 00:02:22.830 
the pace of the episode was just right

00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:25.790 
the pace of the episode was just right
in<00:02:23.100> there<00:02:23.340> and<00:02:23.490> that<00:02:23.610> but<00:02:23.910> I<00:02:24.180> don't<00:02:24.780> know<00:02:24.870> from

00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:25.800 
in there and that but I don't know from

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:27.350 
in there and that but I don't know from
the<00:02:25.980> brilliant<00:02:26.370> episode<00:02:26.700> from<00:02:26.850> last<00:02:27.090> week

00:02:27.350 --> 00:02:27.360 
the brilliant episode from last week

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:29.600 
the brilliant episode from last week
from<00:02:27.480> Mark<00:02:27.660> Gatiss<00:02:27.980> to<00:02:28.980> actually<00:02:29.220> go<00:02:29.280> down<00:02:29.460> to

00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:29.610 
from Mark Gatiss to actually go down to

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:31.370 
from Mark Gatiss to actually go down to
this<00:02:29.700> I<00:02:29.850> don't<00:02:30.120> know<00:02:30.210> just<00:02:30.510> so<00:02:30.870> I<00:02:30.900> didn't<00:02:31.200> feel

00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:31.380 
this I don't know just so I didn't feel

00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:33.830 
this I don't know just so I didn't feel
right<00:02:31.650> about<00:02:31.800> this<00:02:31.950> one<00:02:32.130> I<00:02:32.460> think<00:02:33.210> the<00:02:33.300> payson

00:02:33.830 --> 00:02:33.840 
right about this one I think the payson

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:35.540 
right about this one I think the payson
was<00:02:34.020> okay<00:02:34.380> it<00:02:34.590> just<00:02:34.620> it<00:02:35.010> was<00:02:35.160> like<00:02:35.190> it<00:02:35.430> had<00:02:35.520> the

00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:35.550 
was okay it just it was like it had the

00:02:35.550 --> 00:02:38.510 
was okay it just it was like it had the
jigsaw<00:02:36.090> puzzle<00:02:36.510> there<00:02:36.720> but<00:02:37.290> it<00:02:37.380> never<00:02:37.740> fully

00:02:38.510 --> 00:02:38.520 
jigsaw puzzle there but it never fully

00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:40.280 
jigsaw puzzle there but it never fully
fit<00:02:38.790> together<00:02:39.180> straightaway<00:02:39.780> what<00:02:40.080> I<00:02:40.110> mean

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:40.290 
fit together straightaway what I mean

00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:42.200 
fit together straightaway what I mean
yeah<00:02:40.530> it<00:02:41.190> takes<00:02:41.430> a<00:02:41.520> little<00:02:41.640> bit<00:02:41.760> time<00:02:41.970> don't

00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:42.210 
yeah it takes a little bit time don't

00:02:42.210 --> 00:02:43.430 
yeah it takes a little bit time don't
you<00:02:42.300> understand<00:02:42.660> what's<00:02:42.840> actually<00:02:42.960> going<00:02:43.260> on

00:02:43.430 --> 00:02:43.440 
you understand what's actually going on

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:46.670 
you understand what's actually going on
and<00:02:43.770> I<00:02:43.890> found<00:02:44.250> site<00:02:44.730> like<00:02:45.120> mmm<00:02:46.080> what's<00:02:46.380> going

00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:46.680 
and I found site like mmm what's going

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:49.580 
and I found site like mmm what's going
on<00:02:46.800> here<00:02:47.070> and<00:02:47.220> that<00:02:47.370> and<00:02:47.780> it<00:02:48.780> was<00:02:49.140> trained<00:02:49.350> over

00:02:49.580 --> 00:02:49.590 
on here and that and it was trained over

00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:52.820 
on here and that and it was trained over
it<00:02:49.650> as<00:02:49.770> well<00:02:49.980> I<00:02:50.220> like<00:02:50.940> the<00:02:51.120> idea<00:02:51.270> of<00:02:51.930> exploring

00:02:52.820 --> 00:02:52.830 
it as well I like the idea of exploring

00:02:52.830 --> 00:02:55.010 
it as well I like the idea of exploring
like<00:02:53.220> the<00:02:53.640> different<00:02:54.090> type<00:02:54.270> of<00:02:54.300> universes

00:02:55.010 --> 00:02:55.020 
like the different type of universes

actually<00:03:26.220> it<00:03:26.490> was<00:03:26.580> not<00:03:26.760> too<00:03:27.000> bad<00:03:27.240> it<00:03:27.420> was

00:03:27.530 --> 00:03:27.540 
actually it was not too bad it was

00:03:27.540 --> 00:03:30.890 
actually it was not too bad it was
really<00:03:27.950> it<00:03:28.950> was<00:03:29.070> paced<00:03:29.490> okay<00:03:30.060> but<00:03:30.390> it's<00:03:30.660> not

00:03:30.890 --> 00:03:30.900 
really it was paced okay but it's not

really it was paced okay but it's not
the<00:03:30.930> best<00:03:31.440> direction<00:03:31.860> I've<00:03:32.070> ever<00:03:32.250> seen<00:03:32.459> it's

00:03:32.690 --> 00:03:32.700 
the best direction I've ever seen it's

00:03:32.700 --> 00:03:34.580 
the best direction I've ever seen it's
not<00:03:32.940> too<00:03:33.240> bad<00:03:33.510> though<00:03:33.870> you<00:03:34.170> know<00:03:34.260> how<00:03:34.380> he<00:03:34.440> got

00:03:34.580 --> 00:03:34.590 
not too bad though you know how he got

00:03:34.590 --> 00:03:35.840

all<00:03:34.740> the<00:03:34.830> shots<00:03:35.040> together<00:03:35.220> now<00:03:35.520> thinking

00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:35.850 
all the shots together now thinking

00:03:35.850 --> 00:03:38.420 
all the shots together now thinking
weren't<00:03:36.030> too<00:03:36.270> bad<00:03:36.450> I<00:03:36.810> mean<00:03:37.770> Neil<00:03:37.950> cross<00:03:38.220> has

00:03:38.420 --> 00:03:38.430
