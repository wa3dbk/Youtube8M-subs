today<00:00:00.780> we're<00:00:00.900> going<00:00:00.989> to<00:00:01.079> show<00:00:01.290> you<00:00:01.319> a<00:00:01.439> quick

00:00:01.730 --> 00:00:01.740 
today we're going to show you a quick

00:00:01.740 --> 00:00:03.470 
today we're going to show you a quick
tip<00:00:01.949> on<00:00:02.159> doing<00:00:02.700> something<00:00:02.970> a<00:00:03.179> little<00:00:03.210> bit

00:00:03.470 --> 00:00:03.480 
tip on doing something a little bit

00:00:03.480 --> 00:00:05.570 
tip on doing something a little bit
different<00:00:03.720> with<00:00:03.810> plastisol<00:00:04.350> ink<00:00:04.560> this<00:00:05.370> is

00:00:05.570 --> 00:00:05.580 
different with plastisol ink this is

00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:07.340 
different with plastisol ink this is
part<00:00:05.910> of<00:00:05.970> the<00:00:06.089> impressions<00:00:06.660> quick<00:00:06.930> tips<00:00:07.170> and

00:00:07.340 --> 00:00:07.350 
part of the impressions quick tips and

00:00:07.350 --> 00:00:09.020 
part of the impressions quick tips and
trips<00:00:07.560> through<00:00:07.859> the<00:00:07.980> blog<00:00:08.220> and<00:00:08.550> email

00:00:09.020 --> 00:00:09.030 
trips through the blog and email

00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:11.330 
trips through the blog and email
newsletters<00:00:09.990> so<00:00:10.590> here<00:00:10.740> we<00:00:10.860> have<00:00:10.980> an<00:00:11.070> opaque

00:00:11.330 --> 00:00:11.340 
newsletters so here we have an opaque

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:12.230 
newsletters so here we have an opaque
classist<00:00:11.910> all

00:00:12.230 --> 00:00:12.240 
classist all

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:14.749 
classist all
now<00:00:12.690> opaque<00:00:13.139> inks<00:00:13.440> especially<00:00:13.889> plastisol<00:00:14.519> are

00:00:14.749 --> 00:00:14.759 
now opaque inks especially plastisol are

00:00:14.759 --> 00:00:17.240 
now opaque inks especially plastisol are
all<00:00:15.179> going<00:00:15.450> to<00:00:15.509> be<00:00:15.630> very<00:00:15.870> thick<00:00:16.230> and<00:00:16.470> when

00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:17.250 
all going to be very thick and when

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:18.349 
all going to be very thick and when
they're<00:00:17.369> printed<00:00:17.670> on<00:00:17.730> shirt<00:00:18.000> though<00:00:18.240> they

00:00:18.349 --> 00:00:18.359 
they're printed on shirt though they

00:00:18.359 --> 00:00:19.910 
they're printed on shirt though they
might<00:00:18.510> be<00:00:18.570> brighten<00:00:18.990> opaque<00:00:19.380> you're<00:00:19.830> gonna

00:00:19.910 --> 00:00:19.920 
might be brighten opaque you're gonna

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:21.890 
might be brighten opaque you're gonna
feel<00:00:20.279> them<00:00:20.460> on<00:00:20.580> the<00:00:20.670> shirt<00:00:20.880> so<00:00:21.420> the<00:00:21.510> advantage

00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:21.900 
feel them on the shirt so the advantage

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:23.599 
feel them on the shirt so the advantage
of<00:00:22.020> doing<00:00:22.230> something<00:00:22.380> like<00:00:22.500> discharge<00:00:23.279> is

00:00:23.599 --> 00:00:23.609 
of doing something like discharge is

00:00:23.609 --> 00:00:25.970 
of doing something like discharge is
that<00:00:24.150> discharge<00:00:24.480> seeps<00:00:25.140> into<00:00:25.380> the<00:00:25.500> garment

00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:25.980 
that discharge seeps into the garment

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:28.220 
that discharge seeps into the garment
well<00:00:26.490> plastisol<00:00:27.090> is<00:00:27.180> nothing<00:00:27.599> like<00:00:27.720> discharge

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:28.230 
well plastisol is nothing like discharge

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:30.470 
well plastisol is nothing like discharge
or<00:00:28.500> is<00:00:28.920> it<00:00:29.099> with<00:00:29.609> the<00:00:29.699> type<00:00:29.880> of<00:00:29.910> additive<00:00:30.449> that

00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:30.480 
or is it with the type of additive that

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:32.150 
or is it with the type of additive that
you<00:00:30.630> can<00:00:30.750> actually<00:00:30.900> add<00:00:31.170> into<00:00:31.529> plastisol<00:00:32.130> inks

00:00:32.150 --> 00:00:32.160 
you can actually add into plastisol inks

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:34.130 
you can actually add into plastisol inks
typically<00:00:32.940> its<00:00:33.030> known<00:00:33.149> as<00:00:33.329> plastic<00:00:33.660> charge

00:00:34.130 --> 00:00:34.140 
typically its known as plastic charge

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:36.229 
typically its known as plastic charge
you<00:00:34.469> can<00:00:34.620> actually<00:00:34.860> take<00:00:35.309> a<00:00:35.340> normal<00:00:35.550> plastisol

00:00:36.229 --> 00:00:36.239 
you can actually take a normal plastisol

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:39.170 
you can actually take a normal plastisol
inks<00:00:36.270> and<00:00:36.660> make<00:00:37.440> it<00:00:37.620> a<00:00:37.739> discharge<00:00:38.100> style<00:00:38.940> of

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:39.180 
inks and make it a discharge style of

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:40.790 
inks and make it a discharge style of
ink<00:00:39.390> so<00:00:39.989> essentially<00:00:40.440> we're<00:00:40.590> kind<00:00:40.739> of

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:40.800 
ink so essentially we're kind of

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:42.350 
ink so essentially we're kind of
hydrating<00:00:41.340> the<00:00:41.430> two<00:00:41.610> which<00:00:41.760> is<00:00:41.910> really<00:00:42.149> cool

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:42.360 
hydrating the two which is really cool

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:44.869 
hydrating the two which is really cool
it<00:00:42.450> takes<00:00:42.629> this<00:00:42.780> thick<00:00:43.140> ink<00:00:43.379> usually<00:00:44.370> utilizes

00:00:44.869 --> 00:00:44.879 
it takes this thick ink usually utilizes

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:47.029 
it takes this thick ink usually utilizes
the<00:00:45.000> color<00:00:45.300> of<00:00:45.600> it<00:00:45.780> and<00:00:45.960> the<00:00:46.379> plastics<00:00:46.920> all

00:00:47.029 --> 00:00:47.039 
the color of it and the plastics all

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:48.830 
the color of it and the plastics all
properties<00:00:47.550> of<00:00:47.700> the<00:00:47.789> ink<00:00:47.969> but<00:00:48.450> then<00:00:48.600> adds

00:00:48.830 --> 00:00:48.840 
properties of the ink but then adds

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:51.139 
properties of the ink but then adds
basically<00:00:49.530> a<00:00:49.559> discharge<00:00:49.800> into<00:00:50.250> it<00:00:50.460> so<00:00:50.640> it's

00:00:51.139 --> 00:00:51.149 
basically a discharge into it so it's

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:53.689 
basically a discharge into it so it's
nice<00:00:51.390> and<00:00:51.660> soft<00:00:51.899> but<00:00:52.559> still<00:00:52.770> fairly<00:00:53.010> vibrant

00:00:53.689 --> 00:00:53.699 
nice and soft but still fairly vibrant

00:00:53.699 --> 00:00:55.779 
nice and soft but still fairly vibrant
on<00:00:53.789> the<00:00:53.910> ink<00:00:54.059> so<00:00:54.239> we<00:00:54.360> recommend<00:00:54.660> using<00:00:54.960> more

00:00:55.779 --> 00:00:55.789 
on the ink so we recommend using more

00:00:55.789 --> 00:00:58.069 
on the ink so we recommend using more
brighter<00:00:56.789> colored<00:00:57.149> inks<00:00:57.329> like<00:00:57.480> this<00:00:57.719> opaque

00:00:58.069 --> 00:00:58.079 
brighter colored inks like this opaque

00:00:58.079 --> 00:00:59.689 
brighter colored inks like this opaque
ink<00:00:58.289> works<00:00:58.469> great<00:00:58.829> for<00:00:58.859> that<00:00:59.160> because<00:00:59.219> it's

00:00:59.689 --> 00:00:59.699 
ink works great for that because it's

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:01.400 
ink works great for that because it's
got<00:00:59.820> a<00:00:59.879> lot<00:01:00.120> of<00:01:00.149> pigment<00:01:00.420> in<00:01:00.660> it<00:01:00.840> you<00:01:01.199> wouldn't

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:01.410 
got a lot of pigment in it you wouldn't

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:02.869 
got a lot of pigment in it you wouldn't
want<00:01:01.559> to<00:01:01.649> really<00:01:01.859> use<00:01:01.949> a<00:01:02.100> very<00:01:02.370> very<00:01:02.430> thinning

00:01:02.869 --> 00:01:02.879 
want to really use a very very thinning

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:04.250 
want to really use a very very thinning
because<00:01:02.969> this<00:01:03.239> is<00:01:03.359> gonna<00:01:03.480> really<00:01:03.690> thin<00:01:04.080> the

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:04.260 
because this is gonna really thin the

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:05.899 
because this is gonna really thin the
ink<00:01:04.409> down<00:01:04.589> a<00:01:04.650> lot<00:01:04.920> now<00:01:05.339> sometimes<00:01:05.729> this<00:01:05.820> is

00:01:05.899 --> 00:01:05.909 
ink down a lot now sometimes this is

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:06.980 
ink down a lot now sometimes this is
known<00:01:06.000> as<00:01:06.090> plastic<00:01:06.360> arge

00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:06.990 
known as plastic arge

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:09.740 
known as plastic arge
sometimes<00:01:07.650> it's<00:01:07.860> like<00:01:07.979> a<00:01:08.010> discharge<00:01:08.790> hybrid

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:09.750 
sometimes it's like a discharge hybrid

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:12.230 
sometimes it's like a discharge hybrid
so<00:01:10.320> in<00:01:10.979> the<00:01:11.130> industry<00:01:11.430> is<00:01:11.520> known<00:01:11.729> as<00:01:11.939> different

00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:12.240 
so in the industry is known as different

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:13.250 
so in the industry is known as different
things<00:01:12.270> but<00:01:12.540> essentially<00:01:12.810> what<00:01:12.990> we're<00:01:13.080> doing

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:13.260 
things but essentially what we're doing

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:15.380 
things but essentially what we're doing
is<00:01:13.350> we're<00:01:13.470> adding<00:01:13.500> a<00:01:13.799> discharge<00:01:14.010> base<00:01:14.490> into<00:01:14.850> a

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:15.390 
is we're adding a discharge base into a

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:17.120 
is we're adding a discharge base into a
plastic<00:01:15.600> and<00:01:16.080> if<00:01:16.170> you're<00:01:16.259> doing<00:01:16.409> that<00:01:16.680> you

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:17.130 
plastic and if you're doing that you

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:18.350 
plastic and if you're doing that you
don't<00:01:17.400> want<00:01:17.640> to<00:01:17.759> use<00:01:17.939> just<00:01:18.150> a<00:01:18.299> standard

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:18.360 
don't want to use just a standard

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:20.149 
don't want to use just a standard
discharge<00:01:18.930> because<00:01:18.990> this<00:01:19.229> is<00:01:19.380> specifically

00:01:20.149 --> 00:01:20.159 
discharge because this is specifically

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:21.859 
discharge because this is specifically
made<00:01:20.430> for<00:01:20.790> the<00:01:20.880> purpose<00:01:21.119> of<00:01:21.360> adding<00:01:21.659> into

00:01:21.859 --> 00:01:21.869 
made for the purpose of adding into

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:25.039 
made for the purpose of adding into
plastisol<00:01:22.470> so<00:01:23.070> this<00:01:23.220> mix<00:01:23.430> is<00:01:23.670> 50/50<00:01:24.570> we're

00:01:25.039 --> 00:01:25.049 
plastisol so this mix is 50/50 we're

00:01:25.049 --> 00:01:26.539 
plastisol so this mix is 50/50 we're
going<00:01:25.170> to<00:01:25.229> take<00:01:25.409> it<00:01:25.560> on<00:01:25.619> the<00:01:25.770> scale<00:01:26.070> here<00:01:26.400> and

00:01:26.539 --> 00:01:26.549 
going to take it on the scale here and

00:01:26.549 --> 00:01:29.420 
going to take it on the scale here and
mix<00:01:27.119> in<00:01:27.360> just<00:01:27.930> a<00:01:28.080> little<00:01:28.320> bit<00:01:28.470> to<00:01:28.770> demo<00:01:29.100> the<00:01:29.220> ink

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:29.430 
mix in just a little bit to demo the ink

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:31.340 
mix in just a little bit to demo the ink
we're<00:01:30.030> actually<00:01:30.150> going<00:01:30.360> to<00:01:30.450> print<00:01:30.720> this<00:01:30.869> side

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:31.350 
we're actually going to print this side

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:32.899 
we're actually going to print this side
by<00:01:31.590> side<00:01:31.619> so<00:01:32.159> you<00:01:32.250> can<00:01:32.340> see<00:01:32.549> a<00:01:32.579> really<00:01:32.880> cool

00:01:32.899 --> 00:01:32.909 
by side so you can see a really cool

00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:35.480 
by side so you can see a really cool
comparison<00:01:33.810> so<00:01:34.380> if<00:01:34.409> the<00:01:34.740> plas<00:01:34.950> is<00:01:35.189> all<00:01:35.340> in

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:35.490 
comparison so if the plas is all in

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:40.670 
comparison so if the plas is all in
first<00:01:35.759> and<00:01:37.340> that<00:01:38.340> comes<00:01:38.670> out<00:01:38.880> to<00:01:39.210> 88<00:01:39.780> grams<00:01:40.229> and

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:40.680 
first and that comes out to 88 grams and

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:44.139 
first and that comes out to 88 grams and
then<00:01:41.400> we're<00:01:41.549> going<00:01:41.670> to<00:01:41.729> put<00:01:42.360> in<00:01:42.570> 88<00:01:42.960> grams<00:01:43.409> of

00:01:44.139 --> 00:01:44.149 
then we're going to put in 88 grams of

00:01:44.149 --> 00:01:48.649 
then we're going to put in 88 grams of
the<00:01:45.979> plaster<00:01:46.979> charge<00:01:47.430> additive<00:01:48.270> now<00:01:48.479> this

00:01:48.649 --> 00:01:48.659 
the plaster charge additive now this

00:01:48.659 --> 00:01:50.600 
the plaster charge additive now this
isn't<00:01:48.990> plastic<00:01:49.170> charge<00:01:49.649> actually<00:01:49.950> but<00:01:50.369> it<00:01:50.490> is

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:50.610 
isn't plastic charge actually but it is

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:55.370 
isn't plastic charge actually but it is
the<00:01:50.790> same<00:01:51.030> style<00:01:51.860> all<00:01:52.860> right<00:01:53.070> so<00:01:53.990> another<00:01:54.990> 88

00:01:55.370 --> 00:01:55.380 
the same style all right so another 88

00:01:55.380 --> 00:02:03.000 
the same style all right so another 88
grams<00:01:55.680> it's<00:01:56.399> going<00:01:56.549> to<00:01:56.610> bring<00:01:56.700> us<00:01:56.850> up<00:01:57.000> to<00:01:58.399> 172

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:03.010 

00:02:03.010 --> 00:02:05.340 

and<00:02:03.730> this<00:02:04.390> is<00:02:04.510> gonna<00:02:04.630> make<00:02:04.840> it<00:02:04.990> you<00:02:05.080> can<00:02:05.200> see

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:05.350 
and this is gonna make it you can see

00:02:05.350 --> 00:02:06.780 
and this is gonna make it you can see
how<00:02:05.380> runny<00:02:05.710> this<00:02:05.980> stuff<00:02:06.190> is<00:02:06.340> it's<00:02:06.490> gonna<00:02:06.610> make

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:06.790 
how runny this stuff is it's gonna make

00:02:06.790 --> 00:02:12.720 
how runny this stuff is it's gonna make
it<00:02:06.820> very<00:02:06.910> runny<00:02:07.590> okay<00:02:08.590> there<00:02:09.100> we<00:02:09.310> go<00:02:10.050> and<00:02:11.730> it's

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:12.730 
it very runny okay there we go and it's

00:02:12.730 --> 00:02:17.130 
it very runny okay there we go and it's
a<00:02:12.820> little<00:02:12.970> bit<00:02:13.150> over<00:02:15.030> so<00:02:16.030> now<00:02:16.180> we'll<00:02:16.420> take<00:02:16.570> go

00:02:17.130 --> 00:02:17.140 
a little bit over so now we'll take go

00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:20.760 
a little bit over so now we'll take go
ahead<00:02:17.290> and<00:02:17.410> mix<00:02:17.590> this<00:02:17.800> up<00:02:17.860> very<00:02:18.430> very<00:02:18.520> good<00:02:19.770> so

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:20.770 
ahead and mix this up very very good so

00:02:20.770 --> 00:02:22.890 
ahead and mix this up very very good so
we're<00:02:20.860> mixing<00:02:21.010> that<00:02:21.310> up<00:02:21.370> so<00:02:22.180> it's<00:02:22.330> consistent

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:22.900 
we're mixing that up so it's consistent

00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:25.470 
we're mixing that up so it's consistent
and<00:02:23.830> that's<00:02:24.700> what<00:02:24.880> we're<00:02:25.000> looking<00:02:25.030> for<00:02:25.270> is

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:25.480 
and that's what we're looking for is

00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:27.600 
and that's what we're looking for is
consistency<00:02:25.800> now<00:02:26.800> we<00:02:26.860> are<00:02:27.220> going<00:02:27.340> to<00:02:27.400> add<00:02:27.580> a

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:27.610 
consistency now we are going to add a

00:02:27.610 --> 00:02:29.610 
consistency now we are going to add a
standard<00:02:28.030> discharged<00:02:28.750> age<00:02:28.960> of<00:02:29.230> this<00:02:29.440> to

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:29.620 
standard discharged age of this to

00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:31.290 
standard discharged age of this to
activate<00:02:30.100> it<00:02:30.220> so<00:02:30.250> it's<00:02:30.520> like<00:02:30.730> a<00:02:30.760> standard

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:31.300 
activate it so it's like a standard

00:02:31.300 --> 00:02:33.150 
activate it so it's like a standard
discharge<00:02:31.780> agent<00:02:32.260> and<00:02:32.590> we're<00:02:32.860> going<00:02:32.980> to<00:02:33.010> add

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:33.160 
discharge agent and we're going to add

00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:35.160 
discharge agent and we're going to add
that<00:02:33.310> in<00:02:33.550> or<00:02:34.120> this<00:02:34.240> particular<00:02:34.660> mixture<00:02:34.960> it's

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:35.170 
that in or this particular mixture it's

00:02:35.170 --> 00:02:37.680 
that in or this particular mixture it's
4%<00:02:35.440> now<00:02:35.920> depending<00:02:36.580> on<00:02:36.700> the<00:02:36.790> manufacturer<00:02:37.510> it

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:37.690 
4% now depending on the manufacturer it

00:02:37.690 --> 00:02:39.630 
4% now depending on the manufacturer it
might<00:02:38.200> be<00:02:38.350> a<00:02:38.380> little<00:02:38.560> bit<00:02:38.740> different<00:02:39.130> but<00:02:39.520> with

00:02:39.630 --> 00:02:39.640 
might be a little bit different but with

00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:42.600 
might be a little bit different but with
this<00:02:39.790> typical<00:02:40.480> mixture<00:02:40.960> we're<00:02:41.470> gonna<00:02:41.590> add<00:02:41.800> 4%

00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:42.610 
this typical mixture we're gonna add 4%

00:02:42.610 --> 00:02:44.430 
this typical mixture we're gonna add 4%
agent<00:02:43.090> and<00:02:43.210> then<00:02:43.630> we'll<00:02:43.780> put<00:02:43.990> it<00:02:44.080> on<00:02:44.170> press

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:44.440 
agent and then we'll put it on press

00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:46.650 
agent and then we'll put it on press
side-by-side<00:02:45.310> comparison<00:02:45.970> so<00:02:46.450> we're<00:02:46.540> taking

00:02:46.650 --> 00:02:46.660 
side-by-side comparison so we're taking

00:02:46.660 --> 00:02:48.720 
side-by-side comparison so we're taking
a<00:02:46.930> high<00:02:47.140> opacity<00:02:47.830> plastics<00:02:48.340> all<00:02:48.430> with<00:02:48.550> a<00:02:48.610> lot

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:48.730 
a high opacity plastics all with a lot

00:02:48.730 --> 00:02:51.990 
a high opacity plastics all with a lot
of<00:02:48.760> pigment<00:02:49.180> into<00:02:49.300> it<00:02:49.540> adding<00:02:50.290> in<00:02:50.470> this<00:02:51.250> act

00:02:51.990 --> 00:02:52.000 
of pigment into it adding in this act

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:54.360 
of pigment into it adding in this act
basically<00:02:52.600> this<00:02:53.020> discharge<00:02:53.380> base<00:02:54.160> this

00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:54.370 
basically this discharge base this

00:02:54.370 --> 00:02:56.520 
basically this discharge base this
discharged<00:02:54.850> classes<00:02:55.480> all<00:02:55.630> friendly<00:02:56.050> base<00:02:56.260> and

00:02:56.520 --> 00:02:56.530 
discharged classes all friendly base and

00:02:56.530 --> 00:02:58.110 
discharged classes all friendly base and
then<00:02:56.620> activating<00:02:57.310> it<00:02:57.400> so<00:02:57.580> we've<00:02:57.730> done<00:02:57.910> that

00:02:58.110 --> 00:02:58.120 
then activating it so we've done that

00:02:58.120 --> 00:03:01.230 
then activating it so we've done that
now<00:02:58.690> we're<00:02:58.810> going<00:02:58.900> to<00:02:58.960> add<00:02:59.080> 4%<00:02:59.830> agent<00:03:00.220> so<00:03:00.490> four

00:03:01.230 --> 00:03:01.240 
now we're going to add 4% agent so four

00:03:01.240 --> 00:03:07.699 
now we're going to add 4% agent so four
percent<00:03:01.540> agent<00:03:01.840> on<00:03:01.950> 170<00:03:04.350> that's<00:03:05.350> going<00:03:05.620> to<00:03:05.740> be

00:03:07.699 --> 00:03:07.709 
percent agent on 170 that's going to be

00:03:07.709 --> 00:03:15.309 
percent agent on 170 that's going to be
six<00:03:08.709> grams<00:03:09.040> here<00:03:09.600> to<00:03:10.600> 176

00:03:15.309 --> 00:03:15.319 

00:03:15.319 --> 00:03:18.910 

all<00:03:15.920> right<00:03:16.930> and<00:03:17.930> we'll<00:03:18.200> mix<00:03:18.349> that<00:03:18.469> in<00:03:18.709> let<00:03:18.890> it

00:03:18.910 --> 00:03:18.920 
all right and we'll mix that in let it

00:03:18.920 --> 00:03:20.679 
all right and we'll mix that in let it
activate<00:03:19.370> you<00:03:19.519> want<00:03:19.700> to<00:03:19.760> let<00:03:19.879> to<00:03:19.969> activate<00:03:20.510> up

00:03:20.679 --> 00:03:20.689 
activate you want to let to activate up

00:03:20.689 --> 00:03:22.330 
activate you want to let to activate up
and<00:03:20.870> this<00:03:21.230> needs<00:03:21.439> to<00:03:21.499> be<00:03:21.590> mixed<00:03:21.889> in<00:03:21.980> very

00:03:22.330 --> 00:03:22.340 
and this needs to be mixed in very

00:03:22.340 --> 00:03:24.489 
and this needs to be mixed in very
aggressively<00:03:22.849> now<00:03:22.939> because<00:03:23.359> we're<00:03:23.810> adding<00:03:24.079> an

00:03:24.489 --> 00:03:24.499 
aggressively now because we're adding an

00:03:24.499 --> 00:03:26.319 
aggressively now because we're adding an
agent<00:03:25.069> if<00:03:25.159> it's<00:03:25.280> not<00:03:25.430> mixed<00:03:25.760> in<00:03:25.849> and<00:03:25.969> wrestling

00:03:26.319 --> 00:03:26.329 
agent if it's not mixed in and wrestling

00:03:26.329 --> 00:03:28.209 
agent if it's not mixed in and wrestling
and<00:03:26.359> allowed<00:03:26.599> to<00:03:26.780> dissolve<00:03:27.170> in<00:03:27.379> ink<00:03:27.650> it<00:03:28.159> will

00:03:28.209 --> 00:03:28.219 
and allowed to dissolve in ink it will

00:03:28.219 --> 00:03:32.910 
and allowed to dissolve in ink it will
not<00:03:28.549> activate<00:03:28.879> correctly<00:03:29.980> so<00:03:30.980> while<00:03:31.189> that's

00:03:32.910 --> 00:03:32.920 
not activate correctly so while that's

00:03:32.920 --> 00:03:35.800 
not activate correctly so while that's
mixed<00:03:33.920> up<00:03:34.069> there<00:03:34.400> we'll<00:03:34.760> put<00:03:35.030> it<00:03:35.150> on<00:03:35.209> press<00:03:35.599> so

00:03:35.800 --> 00:03:35.810 
mixed up there we'll put it on press so

00:03:35.810 --> 00:03:37.000 
mixed up there we'll put it on press so
let's<00:03:35.989> go<00:03:36.109> over<00:03:36.230> to<00:03:36.290> the<00:03:36.409> press<00:03:36.590> and<00:03:36.769> see<00:03:36.859> out

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:37.010 
let's go over to the press and see out

00:03:37.010 --> 00:03:40.000 
let's go over to the press and see out
frits<00:03:37.280> okay<00:03:37.939> so<00:03:38.000> we're<00:03:38.239> on<00:03:38.269> press<00:03:38.840> now<00:03:39.049> we're

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:40.010 
frits okay so we're on press now we're

00:03:40.010 --> 00:03:41.709 
frits okay so we're on press now we're

00:03:55.449 --> 00:03:55.459 
in let's go ahead and print the PLAs us

00:03:55.459 --> 00:03:58.089 
in let's go ahead and print the PLAs us
all<00:03:55.639> first<00:03:55.939> now<00:03:56.180> obviously<00:03:57.139> printing<00:03:58.010> an

230 mesh screen we're not going to have

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:05.129 
230 mesh screen we're not going to have
the<00:04:02.449> best<00:04:02.659> result<00:04:03.049> it's<00:04:03.260> going<00:04:03.530> to<00:04:03.650> give<00:04:03.829> us<00:04:04.040> a

00:04:05.129 --> 00:04:05.139 
the best result it's going to give us a

00:04:05.139 --> 00:04:07.360 
the best result it's going to give us a
not<00:04:06.139> a<00:04:06.169> very<00:04:06.409> opaque<00:04:06.709> print<00:04:07.010> because<00:04:07.219> there's

00:04:07.360 --> 00:04:07.370 
not a very opaque print because there's

00:04:07.370 --> 00:04:08.500 
not a very opaque print because there's
a<00:04:07.400> high<00:04:07.549> mesh<00:04:07.730> screen<00:04:07.969> and<00:04:08.120> we're<00:04:08.209> not<00:04:08.329> going

00:04:08.500 --> 00:04:08.510 
a high mesh screen and we're not going

00:04:08.510 --> 00:04:10.360 
a high mesh screen and we're not going
to<00:04:08.569> be<00:04:08.629> using<00:04:08.840> a<00:04:08.900> flash<00:04:09.109> dryer<00:04:09.379> but<00:04:09.949> we<00:04:10.069> want<00:04:10.280> to

00:04:10.360 --> 00:04:10.370 
to be using a flash dryer but we want to

00:04:10.370 --> 00:04:11.740 
to be using a flash dryer but we want to
do<00:04:10.459> this<00:04:10.609> to<00:04:10.730> illustrate<00:04:11.150> the<00:04:11.269> point<00:04:11.510> of<00:04:11.629> how

00:04:11.740 --> 00:04:11.750 
do this to illustrate the point of how

00:04:11.750 --> 00:04:15.490 
do this to illustrate the point of how
it<00:04:11.870> works<00:04:12.819> so<00:04:13.819> we're<00:04:14.000> gonna<00:04:14.090> pass<00:04:14.629> this<00:04:15.049> and

00:04:15.490 --> 00:04:15.500 
it works so we're gonna pass this and

00:04:15.500 --> 00:04:18.279 
it works so we're gonna pass this and
then<00:04:16.489> we're<00:04:16.579> gonna<00:04:16.669> pass<00:04:16.970> this<00:04:17.239> again<00:04:17.630> to<00:04:18.169> make

00:04:18.279 --> 00:04:18.289 
then we're gonna pass this again to make

00:04:18.289 --> 00:04:20.830 
then we're gonna pass this again to make
sure<00:04:18.470> we<00:04:18.590> clear<00:04:18.829> the<00:04:18.949> screen<00:04:19.659> there<00:04:20.659> we<00:04:20.750> have

00:04:20.830 --> 00:04:20.840 
sure we clear the screen there we have

00:04:20.840 --> 00:04:23.050 
sure we clear the screen there we have
our<00:04:20.959> first<00:04:21.109> half<00:04:21.380> no<00:04:21.739> it's<00:04:22.009> not<00:04:22.490> very<00:04:22.789> bright

00:04:23.050 --> 00:04:23.060 
our first half no it's not very bright

00:04:23.060 --> 00:04:25.839 
our first half no it's not very bright
at<00:04:23.240> all<00:04:23.419> but<00:04:24.289> it<00:04:24.380> does<00:04:24.409> show<00:04:24.530> up<00:04:24.949> and<00:04:25.159> print<00:04:25.759> it

00:04:25.839 --> 00:04:25.849 
at all but it does show up and print it

00:04:25.849 --> 00:04:27.700 
at all but it does show up and print it
and<00:04:26.060> clear<00:04:26.330> through<00:04:26.599> this<00:04:26.750> 230<00:04:27.199> mesh<00:04:27.409> screen

00:04:27.700 --> 00:04:27.710 
and clear through this 230 mesh screen

00:04:27.710 --> 00:04:30.270 
and clear through this 230 mesh screen
so<00:04:28.400> now<00:04:28.520> let's<00:04:28.699> go<00:04:28.849> ahead<00:04:28.970> and<00:04:29.270> put<00:04:29.479> the

00:04:30.270 --> 00:04:30.280 
so now let's go ahead and put the

00:04:30.280 --> 00:04:34.330 
so now let's go ahead and put the
discharge<00:04:31.690> mixed<00:04:32.690> ink<00:04:32.990> ratio<00:04:33.770> now<00:04:34.009> this<00:04:34.190> is

00:04:34.330 --> 00:04:34.340 
discharge mixed ink ratio now this is

00:04:34.340 --> 00:04:36.129 
discharge mixed ink ratio now this is
not<00:04:34.520> standard<00:04:35.030> discharge<00:04:35.570> once<00:04:35.750> again<00:04:35.960> so<00:04:36.080> you

00:04:36.129 --> 00:04:36.139 
not standard discharge once again so you

00:04:36.139 --> 00:04:36.999 
not standard discharge once again so you
don't<00:04:36.289> want<00:04:36.409> to<00:04:36.470> go<00:04:36.560> home

00:04:36.999 --> 00:04:37.009 
don't want to go home

00:04:37.009 --> 00:04:38.589 
don't want to go home
pull<00:04:37.400> out<00:04:37.520> some<00:04:37.699> discharge<00:04:38.180> out<00:04:38.389> of<00:04:38.509> your

00:04:38.589 --> 00:04:38.599 
pull out some discharge out of your

00:04:38.599 --> 00:04:41.589 
pull out some discharge out of your
closet<00:04:38.810> or<00:04:39.680> your<00:04:39.710> in<00:04:39.919> closet<00:04:40.430> and<00:04:40.550> then<00:04:40.699> mix<00:04:41.449> it

00:04:41.589 --> 00:04:41.599 
closet or your in closet and then mix it

00:04:41.599 --> 00:04:43.420 
closet or your in closet and then mix it
into<00:04:41.750> plaster<00:04:42.530> song<00:04:42.710> that's<00:04:43.009> not<00:04:43.070> gonna<00:04:43.310> work

00:04:43.420 --> 00:04:43.430 
into plaster song that's not gonna work

00:04:43.430 --> 00:04:46.450 
into plaster song that's not gonna work
this<00:04:43.460> is<00:04:43.820> special<00:04:44.800> type<00:04:45.800> of<00:04:45.830> thing<00:04:46.070> if<00:04:46.250> you<00:04:46.340> can

00:04:46.450 --> 00:04:46.460 
this is special type of thing if you can

00:04:46.460 --> 00:04:48.370 
this is special type of thing if you can
see<00:04:46.580> this<00:04:46.729> is<00:04:46.880> a<00:04:46.909> lot<00:04:47.180> more<00:04:47.210> running<00:04:47.750> I'm<00:04:48.259> gonna

00:04:48.370 --> 00:04:48.380 
see this is a lot more running I'm gonna

00:04:48.380 --> 00:04:51.580 
see this is a lot more running I'm gonna
try<00:04:48.590> to<00:04:48.650> stay<00:04:48.919> on<00:04:48.949> the<00:04:49.220> left<00:04:49.430> side<00:04:49.610> here<00:04:50.590> and

00:04:51.580 --> 00:04:51.590 
try to stay on the left side here and

00:04:51.590 --> 00:04:56.379 
try to stay on the left side here and
then<00:04:52.370> we'll<00:04:52.490> print<00:04:52.699> that<00:04:52.849> again<00:04:55.300> so<00:04:56.300> we

00:04:56.379 --> 00:04:56.389 
then we'll print that again so we

00:04:56.389 --> 00:05:00.730 
then we'll print that again so we
printed<00:04:56.599> both<00:04:56.900> twice<00:04:58.659> now<00:04:59.659> as<00:05:00.020> you<00:05:00.380> can<00:05:00.500> see

00:05:00.730 --> 00:05:00.740 
printed both twice now as you can see

00:05:00.740 --> 00:05:04.480 
printed both twice now as you can see
here<00:05:01.360> much<00:05:02.360> duller<00:05:02.719> but<00:05:03.490> definitely

00:05:04.480 --> 00:05:04.490 
here much duller but definitely

00:05:04.490 --> 00:05:06.610 
here much duller but definitely
penetration<00:05:04.940> in<00:05:05.030> the<00:05:05.060> garment<00:05:05.479> so<00:05:06.139> let's<00:05:06.440> go

00:05:06.610 --> 00:05:06.620 
penetration in the garment so let's go

00:05:06.620 --> 00:05:08.800 
penetration in the garment so let's go
see<00:05:06.919> let's<00:05:07.099> dry<00:05:07.340> it<00:05:07.370> and<00:05:07.520> see<00:05:07.639> what<00:05:07.759> happens<00:05:08.120> so

00:05:08.800 --> 00:05:08.810 
see let's dry it and see what happens so

00:05:08.810 --> 00:05:10.360 
see let's dry it and see what happens so
right<00:05:09.020> now<00:05:09.139> that<00:05:09.380> discharged<00:05:09.979> actually

00:05:10.360 --> 00:05:10.370 
right now that discharged actually

00:05:10.370 --> 00:05:12.490 
right now that discharged actually
activating<00:05:11.120> and<00:05:11.270> basically<00:05:11.780> taking<00:05:12.409> the

00:05:12.490 --> 00:05:12.500 
activating and basically taking the

00:05:12.500 --> 00:05:14.950 
activating and basically taking the
plastics<00:05:12.919> all<00:05:13.009> pigments<00:05:13.580> and<00:05:13.729> dyeing<00:05:14.659> them

00:05:14.950 --> 00:05:14.960 
plastics all pigments and dyeing them

00:05:14.960 --> 00:05:16.300 
plastics all pigments and dyeing them
into<00:05:15.229> the<00:05:15.349> shirt<00:05:15.530> so<00:05:15.650> it's<00:05:15.800> kind<00:05:15.979> of<00:05:16.039> giving

00:05:16.300 --> 00:05:16.310 
into the shirt so it's kind of giving

00:05:16.310 --> 00:05:18.189 
into the shirt so it's kind of giving
that<00:05:16.430> cool<00:05:16.669> hybrid<00:05:17.060> effect<00:05:17.360> of<00:05:17.539> plasticizing

00:05:18.189 --> 00:05:18.199 
that cool hybrid effect of plasticizing

00:05:18.199 --> 00:05:20.050 
that cool hybrid effect of plasticizing
plus<00:05:18.770> discharge<00:05:19.280> so<00:05:19.430> you<00:05:19.520> can<00:05:19.639> do<00:05:19.729> something

00:05:20.050 --> 00:05:20.060 
plus discharge so you can do something

00:05:20.060 --> 00:05:21.969 
plus discharge so you can do something
really<00:05:20.090> cool<00:05:20.479> here<00:05:21.169> the<00:05:21.289> shirts<00:05:21.469> come<00:05:21.740> and

00:05:21.969 --> 00:05:21.979 
really cool here the shirts come and

00:05:21.979 --> 00:05:23.920 
really cool here the shirts come and
we're<00:05:22.310> gonna<00:05:22.400> see<00:05:22.699> it<00:05:22.820> change<00:05:23.180> basically<00:05:23.479> that

00:05:23.920 --> 00:05:23.930 
we're gonna see it change basically that

00:05:23.930 --> 00:05:26.409 
we're gonna see it change basically that
that<00:05:24.560> left<00:05:25.099> side<00:05:25.400> should<00:05:25.699> become<00:05:25.969> a<00:05:26.000> lot

00:05:26.409 --> 00:05:26.419 
that left side should become a lot

00:05:26.419 --> 00:05:28.349 
that left side should become a lot
brighter<00:05:26.840> than<00:05:27.199> the<00:05:27.560> right<00:05:27.740> side

00:05:28.349 --> 00:05:28.359 
brighter than the right side

00:05:28.359 --> 00:05:30.789 
brighter than the right side
all<00:05:29.359> right<00:05:29.569> so<00:05:29.719> on<00:05:29.839> the<00:05:29.929> left<00:05:30.139> side<00:05:30.379> we<00:05:30.619> have

00:05:30.789 --> 00:05:30.799 
all right so on the left side we have

00:05:30.799 --> 00:05:32.709 
all right so on the left side we have
our<00:05:30.829> plastics<00:05:31.579> all<00:05:31.669> discharged<00:05:32.119> hybrid<00:05:32.569> on

00:05:32.709 --> 00:05:32.719 
our plastics all discharged hybrid on

00:05:32.719 --> 00:05:34.509 
our plastics all discharged hybrid on
the<00:05:32.779> right<00:05:33.259> side<00:05:33.469> we<00:05:33.649> have<00:05:33.679> standard<00:05:34.249> opaque

00:05:34.509 --> 00:05:34.519

the right side we have standard opaque
plastisol<00:05:35.059> and<00:05:35.269> you<00:05:35.539> can<00:05:35.689> obviously<00:05:36.049> tell<00:05:36.139> the

00:05:36.459 --> 00:05:36.469 
plastisol and you can obviously tell the

00:05:36.469 --> 00:05:38.589 
plastisol and you can obviously tell the
difference<00:05:36.829> once<00:05:37.429> this<00:05:37.549> is<00:05:37.729> washed<00:05:38.029> this<00:05:38.419> will

00:05:38.589 --> 00:05:38.599 
difference once this is washed this will

00:05:38.599 --> 00:05:39.969 
difference once this is washed this will
continue<00:05:38.959> to<00:05:39.049> feel<00:05:39.199> like<00:05:39.349> classes<00:05:39.799> all

00:05:39.969 --> 00:05:39.979 
continue to feel like classes all

00:05:39.979 --> 00:05:42.069 
continue to feel like classes all
whereas<00:05:40.639> this<00:05:40.819> will<00:05:40.969> be<00:05:41.119> nice<00:05:41.359> and<00:05:41.389> soft<00:05:41.779> light

00:05:42.069 --> 00:05:42.079 
whereas this will be nice and soft light

00:05:42.079 --> 00:05:43.749 
whereas this will be nice and soft light
discharge<00:05:42.589> so<00:05:43.069> something<00:05:43.429> a<00:05:43.549> little

00:05:43.749 --> 00:05:43.759 
discharge so something a little

00:05:43.759 --> 00:05:45.639 
discharge so something a little
different<00:05:44.119> you<00:05:44.149> can<00:05:44.329> use<00:05:44.629> with<00:05:45.049> your<00:05:45.349> standard
