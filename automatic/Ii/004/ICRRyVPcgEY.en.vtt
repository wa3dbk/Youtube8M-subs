00:00:06.190 --> 00:00:10.809
 this is the diagram of our flash 

00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:13.270
 it works based on an integrated 

00:00:10.809 --> 00:00:16.960
 555 timer that is the one that generates 

00:00:13.270 --> 00:00:20.560
 the pulses we can control the duration 

00:00:16.960 --> 00:00:24.040
 of the pulses which will be controlled 

00:00:20.560 --> 00:00:26.740
 for this resistance r 1 and also 

00:00:24.040 --> 00:00:28.870
 we can control the frequency that is 

00:00:26.740 --> 00:00:31.750
 if we want it to go slowly or fast to 

00:00:28.870 --> 00:00:33.219
 through this potentiometer the rest 

00:00:31.750 --> 00:00:35.890
 components so we have some 

00:00:33.219 --> 00:00:38.890
 capacitors resistors diodes and a 

00:00:35.890 --> 00:00:41.350
 mosfet transistor which is the output of 

00:00:38.890 --> 00:00:44.559
 power here we have the arrangement of leds 

00:00:41.350 --> 00:00:47.469
 We have several strips of three LEDs each 

00:00:44.559 --> 00:00:49.929
 one as slow from 12 volts and the leds 

00:00:47.469 --> 00:00:53.109
 whites are approximately 3 to 3.5 

00:00:49.929 --> 00:00:54.560
 volts we can only place strips 

00:00:53.109 --> 00:00:57.050
 of 3 

00:00:54.560 --> 00:01:00.920
 but we can place several of them in 

00:00:57.050 --> 00:01:03.740
 our case we put 55 strips of 3 leds 

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:07.070
 for a total of 15 leds but we could 

00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:09.200
 put either less or more we could put 

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:12.380
 10 strips of 5 led three milk pardon 

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:14.120
 to have a total of one end of 30 

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:17.000
 leds 

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:20.770
 and well let's go now to see the circuit 

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:20.770
 assembled and its operation 

00:01:23.290 --> 00:01:28.030
 we see here the circuit already assembled in 

00:01:25.420 --> 00:01:30.550
 breadboard and let's connect it to 

00:01:28.030 --> 00:01:32.580
 our 12 volt source so that 

00:01:30.550 --> 00:01:35.480
 start working 

00:01:32.580 --> 00:01:37.730
 we have connected the potentiometer 

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:42.050
 at its end where the frequency is 

00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:46.130
 minimum and that's why the flashes will be 

00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:47.870
 long intervals now we are going to turn the 

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:50.020
 potentiometer to increase the 

00:01:47.870 --> 00:01:50.020
 frequency 

00:01:54.790 --> 00:02:03.170
 there we have it faster 

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:03.170
 and now let's put it to the fullest 

00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:10.580
 the speed is too high for the 

00:02:08.350 --> 00:02:15.970
 video camera but you can appreciate 

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:15.970
 that waiting for flash eos very quickly 

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:25.110
 and we return it 

00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:27.150
 at a low frequency 

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:30.510
 this circuit can work during a 

00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:34.160
 long time really consumption like 

00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:34.160
 it's about LEDs it 's pretty low
