00:00:12.670 --> 00:00:15.610

00:00:14.230 --> 00:00:17.620

00:00:15.610 --> 00:00:19.060
 so carry on after a little passage to the 

00:00:17.620 --> 00:00:20.980
 bathroom this moment I use the 

00:00:19.060 --> 00:00:22.780
 big shampoo the mask intense mask 

00:00:20.980 --> 00:00:24.820
 kerastase and made it the image of 

00:00:22.780 --> 00:00:26.350
 that ' I started by busy busy with 

00:00:24.820 --> 00:00:28.690
 my hair so I first apply 

00:00:26.350 --> 00:00:29.950
 him the extraordinary l'orÃ©al and 

00:00:28.690 --> 00:00:32.890
 then I had to give the total 

00:00:29.950 --> 00:00:34.750
 protect dechy then I'm fine 

00:00:32.890 --> 00:00:36.480
 to my skin by first applying a 

00:00:34.750 --> 00:00:38.830
 moisturizer that comes from svr 

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:44.290
 then I come to put my other beauty 

00:00:38.830 --> 00:00:45.640
 from caudalie and lip balm I 

00:00:44.290 --> 00:00:47.440
 then begins with my corrector who 

00:00:45.640 --> 00:00:49.540
 the oven cover of make up for ever in 

00:00:47.440 --> 00:00:51.550
 time number 4 and once I have 

00:00:49.540 --> 00:00:52.690
 finished i'm going to come apply my bottom 

00:00:51.550 --> 00:00:54.790
 of complexion so it's the super staff 

00:00:52.690 --> 00:00:57.010
 better skin of gervais pauline and that's 

00:00:54.790 --> 00:00:58.329
 frankly 1.8 darling of the moment I 

00:00:57.010 --> 00:00:59.829
 really love them the rush is 

00:00:58.329 --> 00:01:02.040
 amazing and the price is over 

00:00:59.829 --> 00:01:02.040
 affordable 

00:01:03.850 --> 00:01:06.820
 I then apply my powder to be in 

00:01:05.320 --> 00:01:08.500
 suicide from make up for ever in 

00:01:06.820 --> 00:01:09.909
 patting with a big powder brush 

00:01:08.500 --> 00:01:11.890
 to avoid messing up all the work 

00:01:09.909 --> 00:01:13.240
 that I did before if we do not shoot too much 

00:01:11.890 --> 00:01:15.550
 the material that it can remove the bottom 

00:01:13.240 --> 00:01:17.680
 complexion or tap then I go to 

00:01:15.550 --> 00:01:19.690
 eyes with my base so everything does that 

00:01:17.680 --> 00:01:22.390
 shadows in chains and I come next 

00:01:19.690 --> 00:01:23.950
 with a color tattoo 2 at gm s is 

00:01:22.390 --> 00:01:25.360
 placed the standing water and I 

00:01:23.950 --> 00:01:26.830
 apply on the entire eyelid 

00:01:25.360 --> 00:01:28.750
 if you find that the color is not 

00:01:26.830 --> 00:01:30.540
 quite intense relay with a brush to 

00:01:28.750 --> 00:01:33.549
 lips apply a little more 

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:35.080
 so once I did all that I 

00:01:33.549 --> 00:01:37.270

00:01:35.080 --> 00:01:38.860

00:01:37.270 --> 00:01:40.690
 involved with a flat brush a 

00:01:38.860 --> 00:01:42.100
 golden color only on the center 

00:01:40.690 --> 00:01:44.380
 my eyelid can give a little 

00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:46.090
 little more dimension and relief and I 

00:01:44.380 --> 00:01:47.320
 come faded a little bit on the 

00:01:46.090 --> 00:01:49.630
 eyelid to not make 

00:01:47.320 --> 00:01:52.299
