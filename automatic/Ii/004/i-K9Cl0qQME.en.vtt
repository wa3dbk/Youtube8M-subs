when they walk by that for
for<00:05:24.410> years<00:05:24.710> and<00:05:25.520> that<00:05:26.270> quote<00:05:26.810> kind<00:05:27.020> of<00:05:27.080> works

00:05:27.250 --> 00:05:27.260 
for years and that quote kind of works

00:05:27.260 --> 00:05:29.110 
for years and that quote kind of works
itself<00:05:27.440> out<00:05:27.770> and<00:05:28.010> then<00:05:28.250> that<00:05:28.670> I<00:05:28.760> became<00:05:29.060> a
