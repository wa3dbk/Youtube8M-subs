00:05:04.920 --> 00:05:04.930 
I think I think it was that I think

00:05:04.930 --> 00:05:07.170 
I think I think it was that I think
winning<00:05:05.289> once<00:05:06.100> we<00:05:06.280> weren't<00:05:06.490> we<00:05:06.669> won<00:05:06.850> there<00:05:07.060> all

winning once we weren't we won there all
windscreen<00:05:07.810> and<00:05:08.020> I<00:05:08.770> think<00:05:09.070> we<00:05:09.130> came<00:05:09.310> back<00:05:09.520> we

00:05:09.689 --> 00:05:09.699 
windscreen and I think we came back we

00:05:09.699 --> 00:05:12.420 
windscreen and I think we came back we
had<00:05:09.820> a<00:05:09.850> big<00:05:10.120> game<00:05:10.360> against<00:05:10.780> Brentford<00:05:11.050> you<00:05:11.430> and

00:05:36.010 --> 00:05:37.529 
a big game could have been it could have
gone<00:05:36.130> evil<00:05:36.460> while<00:05:36.639> we<00:05:36.940> could<00:05:37.090> have<00:05:37.180> just<00:05:37.360> taken

00:05:37.529 --> 00:05:37.539 
gone evil while we could have just taken

00:05:37.539 --> 00:05:39.960 
gone evil while we could have just taken
off<00:05:37.690> foot<00:05:37.900> off<00:05:38.080> the<00:05:38.260> pedal<00:05:38.310> but<00:05:39.310> we<00:05:39.430> didn't<00:05:39.760> we

00:05:39.960 --> 00:05:39.970 
off foot off the pedal but we didn't we

00:05:39.970 --> 00:05:41.460 
off foot off the pedal but we didn't we
went<00:05:40.150> and<00:05:40.270> beat<00:05:40.450> them<00:05:40.660> and<00:05:40.870> went<00:05:41.050> on<00:05:41.169> and<00:05:41.349> won

00:05:41.460 --> 00:05:41.470 
went and beat them and went on and won

00:05:41.470 --> 00:05:44.100 
went and beat them and went on and won
the<00:05:41.500> double<00:05:41.650> and<00:05:42.360> but<00:05:43.360> as<00:05:43.479> I<00:05:43.510> said<00:05:43.810> I<00:05:43.840> think

00:05:44.100 --> 00:05:44.110 
the double and but as I said I think

00:05:44.110 --> 00:05:45.779 
the double and but as I said I think
that<00:05:44.169> Brentwood<00:05:44.680> going<00:05:45.220> for<00:05:45.430> me<00:05:45.550> was<00:05:45.760> just

00:05:45.779 --> 00:05:45.789 
that Brentwood going for me was just

00:05:45.789 --> 00:05:49.469 
that Brentwood going for me was just
electric<00:05:46.979> calling<00:05:47.979> big<00:05:48.250> problem<00:05:48.729> with<00:05:49.270> that

00:05:49.469 --> 00:05:49.479 
electric calling big problem with that

00:05:49.479 --> 00:05:53.219 
electric calling big problem with that
is<00:05:49.750> because<00:05:50.490> the<00:05:51.490> Wembley<00:05:51.970> final<00:05:52.810> was<00:05:52.960> so

00:05:53.219 --> 00:05:53.229 
is because the Wembley final was so

00:05:53.229 --> 00:05:58.529 
is because the Wembley final was so
close<00:05:53.560> to<00:05:53.800> the<00:05:53.919> brim<00:05:54.130> food<00:05:54.490> game<00:05:57.240> you<00:05:58.240> know<00:05:58.360> the
