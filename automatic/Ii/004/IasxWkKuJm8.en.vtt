 hello everyone, kinder surprise channel 

00:00:03.689 --> 00:00:09.570
 and before your eyes a series 

00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:12.330
 velvet birds or happy birthday 

00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:15.750
 so she called abroad me 

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:19.410
 it seems we did not leave this series I 

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:21.840
 I bought a bird from a collector 

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:25.080
 really velvet and I think they 

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:25.710
 made either from ceramic or from 

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:27.720
 something 

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:32.399
 can be done so paws because 

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:35.300
 by sound they are really made of 

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:37.610
 some very very solid material 

00:00:35.300 --> 00:00:41.910
 definitely not plastic 

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:45.690
 This time in the second guys but not such 

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:48.899
 cool that bluebird is yellow orange 

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:52.379
 green and purple I would know how 

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:54.629
 Here I would like to call this series yet 

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:56.219
 just happy birthday because if 

00:00:54.629 --> 00:00:57.000

00:00:56.219 --> 00:00:59.789

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:04.170

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:06.240
 happy bird day well guys but here 

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:09.990
 for example the bird is orange but it 

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:13.200
 really sad because she hung beak 

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:13.950
 hung up the nose that is but everything is already she 

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:17.130
 sad 

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:20.759
 blue is generally a badass some hey you go 

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:24.119

00:01:20.759 --> 00:01:26.420

00:01:24.119 --> 00:01:29.939
 so here he is really happy 

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:32.790
 green happy too this here 

00:01:29.939 --> 00:01:34.770
 bird and purple does not seem to want 

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:35.250
 waste all your money because he 

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:37.470
 whistles 

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:41.990

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:45.630
 crossed all cool cool here 

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:49.170
 Here is the liner I if the series 

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:52.380
 stariy will show the liner here 

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:57.659
 liner in the back as you see everything is not on 

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:59.969
 our language is the language now burdenko this 

00:01:57.659 --> 00:02:03.390
 German is a blue liner 

00:01:59.969 --> 00:02:06.320
 For example, the bird looks exactly the same 

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:08.960
 liner and to all the rest that is 

00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:12.490
 but here's the front side like this 

00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:15.590
 shows all of the five birds and on the back 

00:02:12.490 --> 00:02:17.630
 depicts a separate birdie each well 

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:22.370
 Here, in principle, everything is such 

00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:25.970
