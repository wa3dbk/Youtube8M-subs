00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:03.909
 [Music] 

00:00:01.480 --> 00:00:05.529
 let the animals suffer the French 

00:00:03.909 --> 00:00:08.610
 first we go for them by those who 

00:00:05.529 --> 00:00:11.400
 they won and defeated nicholas 

00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:13.860
 Look at what a beautiful picture in German 

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:16.860
 with the green shirt that looks like 

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:23.240
 mexico but it 's german is waving to 

00:00:16.860 --> 00:00:23.240
 the French and tells the parties 

00:00:29.370 --> 00:00:37.720
 Like a geek, I'm very good at the end 

00:00:34.300 --> 00:00:40.810
 stood out the archer at the end son 82 86 

00:00:37.720 --> 00:00:43.030
 more December versus losing as 

00:00:40.810 --> 00:00:45.450
 you can see how it can be is bullshit 

00:00:43.030 --> 00:00:45.450
 is 

00:00:55.710 --> 00:01:01.930
 German has played a little more than 

00:00:58.900 --> 00:01:05.200
 tourist press or business 

00:01:01.930 --> 00:01:05.200
 [Music] 

00:01:12.970 --> 00:01:20.729
 as in 2010 

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:23.640
 the collective likewise but friends that 

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:26.090
 France end but lags the 

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:26.090
 match 

00:01:28.980 --> 00:01:36.380
 if we go with nothing 

00:01:36.400 --> 00:01:41.670
 [Music] 

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:46.880
 what is he talking about 

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:46.880
 Lord keep singing I like how he sings 

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:51.710
 eleven 

00:01:59.230 --> 00:02:03.009
 min 

00:02:00.700 --> 00:02:05.280
 a little scary to approach me but what 

00:02:03.009 --> 00:02:08.660
 let's try 

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:16.680
 good wave 

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:21.480
 there are many of the first three matches 

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:22.830
 of deference and we are very sad now 

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:26.550
 but 

00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:28.650
 It is also another job that the 

00:02:26.550 --> 00:02:32.250
 qualified and 

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:38.750
 we are for the planner good what 

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:38.750
 they had the embarrassment for the match of 

00:02:40.310 --> 00:02:47.500
 benzema and you need like 

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:51.010
 and that to mark and it was only the 

00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:52.870
 third there was a problem and for just 

00:02:51.010 --> 00:02:55.680
 Who do you want to be champion now? 

00:02:52.870 --> 00:02:55.680
 that is not French 

00:02:55.780 --> 00:03:04.310
 I do not know do not know why it is the first the 

00:03:01.390 --> 00:03:08.140
 first world cup that I what 

00:03:04.310 --> 00:03:08.140
 that strong teams 

00:03:08.450 --> 00:03:16.620
 do not happen 

00:03:10.470 --> 00:03:16.620
 that is very particular 

00:03:18.380 --> 00:03:24.550
 [Applause] 

00:03:19.960 --> 00:03:27.610
 German can win 

00:03:24.550 --> 00:03:30.220
 I do not know let's see now Colombia and 

00:03:27.610 --> 00:03:32.740
 Brazil now now Colombia Brazil but 

00:03:30.220 --> 00:03:34.930
 it's true what they point to me from 

00:03:32.740 --> 00:03:36.340
 the study and then the elections 

00:03:34.930 --> 00:03:37.810
 European never win 

00:03:36.340 --> 00:03:40.840
 In America 

00:03:37.810 --> 00:03:43.900
 it can never be the first time 

00:03:40.840 --> 00:03:43.900
 [Music] 

00:03:44.640 --> 00:03:51.590
 Argentina I think Argentina is going to be 

00:03:49.030 --> 00:03:53.710
 a bit difficult 

00:03:51.590 --> 00:03:56.820
 [Music] 

00:03:53.710 --> 00:03:56.820
 mouth cachito 

00:03:57.280 --> 00:04:07.120
 but as I said before the big 

00:04:02.860 --> 00:04:11.069
 teams like argentina brasil france 

00:04:07.120 --> 00:04:11.069
 it's a bit difficult for them 

00:04:11.260 --> 00:04:13.920
 in Belgium 

00:04:14.300 --> 00:04:22.150
 yes of course yes lukaku for example but 

00:04:17.299 --> 00:04:25.590
 he's going to score like carlos gol I think 

00:04:22.150 --> 00:04:25.590
 let's hope that three months 

00:04:26.350 --> 00:04:30.010
 the player 

00:04:32.170 --> 00:04:38.210
 yes thank you but people 

00:04:35.390 --> 00:04:42.580
 has only one month and the rest of the team does not 

00:04:38.210 --> 00:04:42.580
 has a collectively 

00:04:43.969 --> 00:04:47.679
 for all three at once 

00:04:52.329 --> 00:04:58.939
 but it does not have the exact emotional charge 

00:04:57.259 --> 00:05:01.249
 the journalistic exercise that says yesterday 

00:04:58.939 --> 00:05:04.029
 on the table to erase the names and 

00:05:01.249 --> 00:05:04.029
 leave reality 

00:05:06.860 --> 00:05:14.390
 I think we accept it as we are well 

00:05:11.389 --> 00:05:18.250
 let's suffer 

00:05:14.390 --> 00:05:18.250
 that is, the strengths 

00:05:18.310 --> 00:05:23.500
 in German or French
