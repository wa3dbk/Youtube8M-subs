00:03:06.759 --> 00:03:06.769 
couple hours but yeah it's whatever you

00:03:06.769 --> 00:03:09.819 
couple hours but yeah it's whatever you
want<00:03:06.920> to<00:03:06.980> do<00:03:07.100> so<00:03:07.400> there<00:03:08.299> it<00:03:08.420> is<00:03:08.600> it's<00:03:09.170> a<00:03:09.500> cooking

00:03:09.819 --> 00:03:09.829 
want to do so there it is it's a cooking

00:03:09.829 --> 00:03:12.009 
want to do so there it is it's a cooking
now<00:03:10.519> the<00:03:10.579> ninja<00:03:11.060> does<00:03:11.239> cook<00:03:11.480> a<00:03:11.510> little<00:03:11.810> bit

00:03:12.009 --> 00:03:12.019 
now the ninja does cook a little bit

00:03:12.019 --> 00:03:17.020 
now the ninja does cook a little bit
hotter<00:03:12.430> just<00:03:13.430> because<00:03:13.730> of<00:03:14.000> the<00:03:15.790> pot<00:03:16.790> being

00:03:17.020 --> 00:03:17.030 
hotter just because of the pot being

00:03:17.030 --> 00:03:20.050 
hotter just because of the pot being
metal<00:03:17.810> versus<00:03:18.200> this<00:03:18.350> traditional<00:03:19.100> crock<00:03:19.340> so

00:03:20.050 --> 00:03:20.060 
metal versus this traditional crock so

00:03:20.060 --> 00:03:22.569 
metal versus this traditional crock so
this<00:03:20.959> would<00:03:21.139> probably<00:03:21.170> be<00:03:21.470> done<00:03:21.709> I<00:03:22.100> would

00:03:22.569 --> 00:03:22.579 
this would probably be done I would

00:03:22.579 --> 00:03:25.259 
this would probably be done I would
imagine<00:03:23.000> it<00:03:23.269> about<00:03:23.480> six<00:03:23.810> and<00:03:23.900> a<00:03:23.989> half<00:03:24.019> hours

00:03:25.259 --> 00:03:25.269 
imagine it about six and a half hours

00:03:25.269 --> 00:03:27.490 
imagine it about six and a half hours
traditional<00:03:26.269> Crockett<00:03:26.660> I'd<00:03:26.930> let<00:03:27.109> it<00:03:27.139> go<00:03:27.230> for

00:03:27.490 --> 00:03:27.500

00:05:29.530 --> 00:05:31.050 
little bit too buttery so I would
definitely<00:05:29.650> make<00:05:29.950> it<00:05:29.980> again<00:05:30.310> but<00:05:30.640> I<00:05:30.880> would

00:05:31.050 --> 00:05:31.060 
definitely make it again but I would

00:05:31.060 --> 00:05:35.370 
definitely make it again but I would
probably<00:05:32.160> cut<00:05:33.160> the<00:05:33.370> butter<00:05:33.850> in<00:05:34.210> half<00:05:34.900> and<00:05:35.200> only

00:05:35.370 --> 00:05:35.380 
probably cut the butter in half and only

00:05:35.380 --> 00:05:37.700 
probably cut the butter in half and only
use<00:05:35.470> 1/2<00:05:35.650> a<00:05:35.830> stick<00:05:35.890> instead<00:05:36.370> of<00:05:36.460> a<00:05:36.520> whole<00:05:36.640> stick

00:05:37.700 --> 00:05:37.710 
use 1/2 a stick instead of a whole stick

00:05:37.710 --> 00:05:40.980 
use 1/2 a stick instead of a whole stick
other<00:05:38.710> than<00:05:38.830> that<00:05:38.950> we<00:05:39.850> added<00:05:40.030> some<00:05:40.420> carrots

00:05:40.980 --> 00:05:40.990 
other than that we added some carrots

00:05:40.990 --> 00:05:44.760 
other than that we added some carrots
and<00:05:41.170> potatoes<00:05:41.590> and<00:05:42.010> they<00:05:43.140> were<00:05:44.140> delicious<00:05:44.500> as

00:05:44.760 --> 00:05:44.770 
and potatoes and they were delicious as

00:05:44.770 --> 00:05:47.190 
and potatoes and they were delicious as
well<00:05:44.940> so<00:05:45.940> we<00:05:46.300> added<00:05:46.570> them<00:05:46.690> in<00:05:46.840> a<00:05:46.870> little<00:05:47.050> bit

00:05:47.190 --> 00:05:47.200 
well so we added them in a little bit

00:05:47.200 --> 00:05:49.860 
well so we added them in a little bit
late<00:05:47.500> so<00:05:47.980> they<00:05:48.700> could<00:05:48.940> have<00:05:49.030> probably<00:05:49.180> went<00:05:49.750> in

00:05:49.860 --> 00:05:49.870 
late so they could have probably went in

00:05:49.870 --> 00:05:53.310 
late so they could have probably went in
a<00:05:49.900> little<00:05:49.990> bit<00:05:50.320> earlier<00:05:50.650> but<00:05:51.400> um<00:05:52.320> everything

00:05:53.310 --> 00:05:53.320 
a little bit earlier but um everything

00:05:53.320 --> 00:05:55.290 
a little bit earlier but um everything
