00:00:06.210 --> 00:00:15.090
 Hello Today's photo's announcer Pakso 

00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:17.400
 Kim Hyo-jung is the main event of the 2014 Brazil World Cup featured today 

00:00:15.090 --> 00:00:22.800
 I want to talk about the highlight . 

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:26.400
 It was seven o'clock today . Japan and Greece were unfolded . 

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:31.470
 Japan has virtually no advance in the Round of 16 

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:33.150
 4 Tickets for the 16th round. As far as tickets go, 

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:39.390
 I showed him the game. 

00:00:33.150 --> 00:00:43.950
 Japan is only late in the second half of the 404, but easily showing a surprising pattern 

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:45.570
 Share and show and showed a pass success rate of game r 0 0 

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:49.050
 It's finished. 

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:53.190
 So what happens to the overall score in group c when this happens? 

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:57.719
 4 Colombia took 6 points because they played 2 consecutive wins. 

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:58.710
 Cote d'Ivoire win points and Japan and Greece each score 1 point 

00:00:57.719 --> 00:01:03.090
 I brought it. 

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:05.910
 Yes, there is still one qualifying match, but Colombia and Ivory Coast 

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:09.570
 We are sure to advance 

00:01:05.910 --> 00:01:14.100
 What kind of keyword can you summarize this game against Japan and Greece ? 

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:14.790
 Yesterday I thought it might be a retirement of a war criminal and Ichikuranis 

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:18.659
 That's it. 

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:23.100
 If you are an Adeck player, you are a player 

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:27.869
 Why do not you remember the armistice right? 2010 South Africa World Cup 

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:33.150
 Now during the match against Korea, I now have a coupe with my own football 5 

00:01:27.869 --> 00:01:35.579
 The grass is looking at the grass Now I sit down on the spot and pound the grass Toddak Then 

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:39.990
 I showed you that kind of manners I covered. 

00:01:35.579 --> 00:01:44.100
 Yeah. That was a lot of parody with some pictures. Right. 

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:48.259
 For those four manners were the M car chyuah Nice quiet player is sent off 

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:53.369
 Neka is also the Greek captain of the 27-minute 

00:01:48.259 --> 00:01:57.720
 Okubo has now been warned for a foul foul. 

00:01:53.369 --> 00:01:59.640
 After 11 minutes , he tried another tackle of another 

00:01:57.720 --> 00:02:03.119
 I got a warning again. 

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:07.770
 Eventually, I was dismissed as a cumulative warning. 

00:02:03.119 --> 00:02:12.030
 In fact, Korea is also ahead of the game against Algeria, 

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:14.459
 You three players received a yellow card yes yes Run accumulated in oral 

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:19.260
 Chairman of the others are not worth 

00:02:14.459 --> 00:02:20.790
 Ten facts in the fact that the Neka Nike player's retirement 

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:25.620
 The game is in progress. 

00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:27.989
 Nevertheless, Japan did not score, so the fans' 

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:31.319
 I heard it was a big deal. 

00:02:27.989 --> 00:02:34.319
 Yes, but I think the hairpins should get their fans too. 

00:02:31.319 --> 00:02:39.989
 The camera's electrical sound was taken. 

00:02:34.319 --> 00:02:44.459
 In the first half of the 4th game, the stadium relay camera hit the stands. 

00:02:39.989 --> 00:02:45.540
 A full-scale crime scene on the whole face and the appearance of a Japanese football fan cheering 

00:02:44.459 --> 00:02:48.000
 That's it. 

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:52.470
 Another crowd wore a full-scale weapon on their shoulders 

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:55.470
 It seems that they showed the unfolding of today. 

00:02:52.470 --> 00:03:00.390
 The announcer says you have a tidy one. 

00:02:55.470 --> 00:03:05.310
 I watched all of you cool. Yes , 

00:03:00.390 --> 00:03:09.330
 The draw is that something like a soccer ticket is a waste of money. 

00:03:05.310 --> 00:03:14.490
 He said he had to put a dead sea on the football field. 

00:03:09.330 --> 00:03:18.390
 At that time, the announcer is now an independant activist and a national meritor 

00:03:14.490 --> 00:03:22.110
 It's known as a grandson, and it's creating a bigger topic. 

00:03:18.390 --> 00:03:23.220
 4 Every time there is a game in Japan, 

00:03:22.110 --> 00:03:26.430
 Yes, it is. 

00:03:23.220 --> 00:03:32.310
 I do not know what the idea is to keep this record going. 

00:03:26.430 --> 00:03:37.110
 I'm looking right neighbors 16 finals in the country for almost 10 Japanese jyeotdago weak 

00:03:32.310 --> 00:03:40.910
 The more this time, the more the players are in good condition 

00:03:37.110 --> 00:03:40.910
 I wish I could taste the victory now.
