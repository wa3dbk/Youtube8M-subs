just makes four of these and two of

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:26.920 
just makes four of these and two of
these<00:01:25.250> and<00:01:25.670> then<00:01:25.759> pour<00:01:26.060> these<00:01:26.300> into<00:01:26.600> these

into<00:01:27.229> these<00:01:27.440> you<00:01:27.860> started<00:01:28.190> off<00:01:28.310> thinking

00:01:28.510 --> 00:01:28.520 
into these you started off thinking

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:30.880 
into these you started off thinking
you're<00:01:28.850> only<00:01:29.000> making<00:01:29.240> a<00:01:29.509> part<00:01:29.780> and<00:01:30.080> then<00:01:30.770> he

00:01:33.130 --> 00:01:33.140 
realized that you're making it a huge

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:37.899
