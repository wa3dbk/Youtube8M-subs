time when I was to say it and I played
it<00:01:54.140> like<00:01:54.229> hell<00:01:55.869> now<00:01:56.869> you<00:01:57.200> want<00:01:57.380> out<00:01:57.530> like<00:01:57.740> a

sheer<00:01:58.189> so<00:01:58.369> we<00:01:58.429> can<00:01:58.579> get<00:01:58.759> the<00:01:59.240> this<00:01:59.719> song<00:02:01.090> since

00:02:02.080 --> 00:02:02.090 
sheer so we can get the this song since

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:05.279 
sheer so we can get the this song since
the<00:02:02.360> gong<00:02:02.539> to<00:02:02.689> work<00:02:02.840> 50<00:02:03.170> rings<00:02:03.409> it's<00:02:03.740> very<00:02:04.009> well

00:02:05.279 --> 00:02:05.289 
the gong to work 50 rings it's very well

00:02:05.289 --> 00:02:11.050 
the gong to work 50 rings it's very well
and<00:02:06.520> since<00:02:07.520> you<00:02:07.729> only<00:02:07.849> take<00:02:08.299> out<00:02:09.429> when<00:02:10.429> you<00:02:10.610> get

00:02:11.050 --> 00:02:11.060 
and since you only take out when you get

00:02:11.060 --> 00:02:12.970

hit<00:02:11.239> the<00:02:11.720> only<00:02:11.959> sin<00:02:12.170> ring<00:02:12.380> so<00:02:12.620> we<00:02:12.650> have<00:02:12.829> not

00:02:12.970 --> 00:02:12.980 
hit the only sin ring so we have not

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:14.289 
hit the only sin ring so we have not
much<00:02:13.040> to<00:02:13.190> worry<00:02:13.340> about<00:02:13.400> in<00:02:13.640> this<00:02:13.700> mission<00:02:13.940> it's

00:02:14.289 --> 00:02:14.299 
much to worry about in this mission it's

00:02:14.299 --> 00:02:16.300 
much to worry about in this mission it's
much<00:02:14.510> more<00:02:14.690> forgiving<00:02:15.079> than<00:02:15.110> you<00:02:15.290> my<00:02:15.860> finger

00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:16.310 
much more forgiving than you my finger

00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:22.010 
much more forgiving than you my finger
is

00:02:22.010 --> 00:02:22.020 

00:02:22.020 --> 00:02:24.140 

this<00:02:22.470> little<00:02:22.650> kind<00:02:22.800> of<00:02:22.890> proves<00:02:23.160> that<00:02:23.310> the<00:02:23.970> guns

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:24.150 
this little kind of proves that the guns

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:28.010 
this little kind of proves that the guns
aren't<00:02:24.360> all<00:02:24.630> bad<00:02:24.900> in<00:02:25.140> this<00:02:25.200> game<00:02:25.320> and<00:02:26.690> then<00:02:27.690> we

00:02:28.010 --> 00:02:28.020 
aren't all bad in this game and then we

00:02:28.020 --> 00:02:33.650 
aren't all bad in this game and then we
can<00:02:28.140> use<00:02:28.320> the<00:02:28.440> size<00:02:28.680> of<00:02:28.860> instruction<00:02:32.660> however

00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:33.660 
can use the size of instruction however

00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:35.450 
can use the size of instruction however
it's<00:02:33.780> actually<00:02:33.900> I've<00:02:34.440> got<00:02:34.680> almost<00:02:34.980> actually<00:02:35.190> a

00:02:35.450 --> 00:02:35.460 
it's actually I've got almost actually a

00:02:35.460 --> 00:02:38.120 
it's actually I've got almost actually a
fourth<00:02:35.760> already<00:02:36.120> now<00:02:36.960> for<00:02:37.110> this<00:02:37.170> minigame<00:02:37.470> red

00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:38.130 
fourth already now for this minigame red

00:02:38.130 --> 00:02:40.240 
fourth already now for this minigame red
balloons<00:02:38.370> would<00:02:38.460> work<00:02:38.640> like<00:02:38.850> one<00:02:39.120> point<00:02:39.390> yo<00:02:39.870> or

00:02:40.240 --> 00:02:40.250 
balloons would work like one point yo or

00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:43.280 
balloons would work like one point yo or
double<00:02:41.250> so<00:02:41.940> yo<00:02:42.180> are<00:02:42.360> your<00:02:42.480> top<00:02:42.600> priority<00:02:42.900> but

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:43.290 
double so yo are your top priority but

00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:45.260 
double so yo are your top priority but
don't<00:02:43.530> hit<00:02:43.650> the<00:02:43.740> purple<00:02:44.100> cuz<00:02:44.280> they<00:02:45.030> have<00:02:45.120> big

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:45.270 
don't hit the purple cuz they have big

00:02:45.270 --> 00:02:46.400 
don't hit the purple cuz they have big
mitts<00:02:45.450> face<00:02:45.630> and<00:02:45.840> they'll<00:02:45.930> cause<00:02:46.080> you<00:02:46.200> to<00:02:46.290> lose

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:46.410 
mitts face and they'll cause you to lose

00:02:46.410 --> 00:02:51.410 
mitts face and they'll cause you to lose
points<00:02:46.590> I<00:02:49.070> think<00:02:50.070> it's<00:02:50.190> like<00:02:50.340> that<00:02:50.580> Hedgehog

00:02:51.410 --> 00:02:51.420 
points I think it's like that Hedgehog

00:02:51.420 --> 00:03:00.620 
points I think it's like that Hedgehog
