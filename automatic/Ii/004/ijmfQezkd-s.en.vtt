00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:06.320 
hi I'm back to teach you how to digitize
a<00:00:03.659> daffodil<00:00:04.259> in<00:00:04.500> in<00:00:04.890> the<00:00:05.250> studio<00:00:05.730> but<00:00:06.000> before

draw<00:00:07.950> your<00:00:08.099> daffodil<00:00:08.490> to<00:00:08.639> start<00:00:08.910> with<00:00:09.120> I'm

00:00:09.650 --> 00:00:09.660 
draw your daffodil to start with I'm

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:11.870 
draw your daffodil to start with I'm
using<00:00:09.990> designer<00:00:10.500> draw<00:00:10.830> 3<00:00:11.219> which<00:00:11.400> is<00:00:11.519> the<00:00:11.639> free

00:00:11.870 --> 00:00:11.880 
using designer draw 3 which is the free

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:15.650 
using designer draw 3 which is the free
version<00:00:11.910> of<00:00:12.450> zone<00:00:12.960> a<00:00:12.990> draw<00:00:14.089> okay<00:00:15.089> now<00:00:15.360> as<00:00:15.509> you

00:00:15.650 --> 00:00:15.660 
version of zone a draw okay now as you

00:00:17.330 --> 00:00:17.340 
can see I have all the parts to my

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:20.359 
can see I have all the parts to my
daffodil<00:00:17.880> I<00:00:18.320> started<00:00:19.320> off<00:00:19.470> with<00:00:19.800> this<00:00:20.039> part

00:00:20.359 --> 00:00:20.369 
daffodil I started off with this part

00:00:20.369 --> 00:00:24.800 
daffodil I started off with this part
and<00:00:22.220> just<00:00:23.220> to<00:00:23.640> get<00:00:23.789> a<00:00:23.820> shape<00:00:24.119> like<00:00:24.420> a<00:00:24.449> leaf

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:24.810 
and just to get a shape like a leaf

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:27.250 
and just to get a shape like a leaf
which<00:00:25.289> is<00:00:25.529> going<00:00:25.769> to<00:00:25.859> go<00:00:26.099> on<00:00:26.310> to<00:00:26.430> the<00:00:26.550> Oval<00:00:26.970> tool

00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:21.240 
was the first leaf that I did then I did

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:23.929 
was the first leaf that I did then I did
a<00:01:21.299> control<00:01:21.750> D<00:01:22.049> to<00:01:22.259> duplicate<00:01:22.799> it<00:01:23.040> and<00:01:23.280> then<00:01:23.640> I

00:01:23.929 --> 00:01:23.939 
a control D to duplicate it and then I

00:01:23.939 --> 00:01:26.179 
a control D to duplicate it and then I
went<00:01:24.150> up<00:01:24.360> and<00:01:24.540> flipped<00:01:25.170> it<00:01:25.380> using<00:01:25.770> this<00:01:25.890> tool

00:01:26.179 --> 00:01:26.189 
went up and flipped it using this tool

00:01:26.189 --> 00:01:29.440 
went up and flipped it using this tool
here<00:01:26.549> and<00:01:26.700> that<00:01:27.540> gave<00:01:27.810> us<00:01:28.080> the<00:01:28.740> second<00:01:29.159> leaf

00:01:29.440 --> 00:01:29.450 
here and that gave us the second leaf

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:35.330 
here and that gave us the second leaf
which<00:01:30.450> was<00:01:30.659> this<00:01:30.810> one<00:01:33.650> okay<00:01:34.650> so<00:01:34.710> I<00:01:34.979> move<00:01:35.220> that

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:35.340 
which was this one okay so I move that

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:39.620 
which was this one okay so I move that
one<00:01:35.460> into<00:01:35.640> place<00:01:36.710> again<00:01:37.710> I<00:01:38.159> duplicated<00:01:39.000> will

00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:39.630 
one into place again I duplicated will

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:41.899 
one into place again I duplicated will
just<00:01:39.810> sit<00:01:39.990> down<00:01:40.020> in<00:01:40.350> size<00:01:40.619> and<00:01:41.400> that<00:01:41.640> gave<00:01:41.880> me

00:01:41.899 --> 00:01:41.909 
just sit down in size and that gave me

00:01:41.909 --> 00:01:44.960 
just sit down in size and that gave me
the<00:01:42.030> third<00:01:42.329> one<00:01:43.670> again

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:44.970 
the third one again

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:48.649 
the third one again
I<00:01:45.000> just<00:01:45.710> duplicated<00:01:46.710> it<00:01:47.000> change<00:01:48.000> the<00:01:48.180> size<00:01:48.450> of

00:01:48.649 --> 00:01:48.659 
I just duplicated it change the size of

00:01:48.659 --> 00:01:52.569 
I just duplicated it change the size of
it<00:01:48.950> and<00:01:49.950> that's<00:01:50.070> giving<00:01:50.430> me<00:01:50.540> my<00:01:51.540> fourth<00:01:51.840> leaf

00:01:52.569 --> 00:01:52.579
