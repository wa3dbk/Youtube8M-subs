using<00:01:48.270> dark<00:01:49.229> RP<00:01:49.590> it<00:01:50.369> just<00:01:50.640> doesn't<00:01:50.939> like<00:01:51.060> that

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:51.270 
using dark RP it just doesn't like that

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:53.870 
using dark RP it just doesn't like that
because<00:01:51.659> when<00:01:52.619> you're<00:01:52.770> coding<00:01:53.159> what<00:01:53.490> happens

00:01:53.870 --> 00:01:53.880 
because when you're coding what happens

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:58.190 
because when you're coding what happens
is<00:01:54.500> the<00:01:56.600> letters<00:01:57.600> and<00:01:57.780> everything<00:01:58.079> that

that type of a notepad it combines it
all<00:02:05.189> and<00:02:05.460> flattens<00:02:05.939> it<00:02:06.149> and<00:02:06.479> the<00:02:06.810> server

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:07.140 
all and flattens it and the server

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:08.859 
all and flattens it and the server
doesn't<00:02:07.409> know<00:02:07.590> how<00:02:07.710> to<00:02:07.799> read<00:02:08.039> it

00:02:08.859 --> 00:02:08.869

start it won't function correctly and

00:02:12.769 --> 00:02:15.970 
start it won't function correctly and
stuff<00:02:13.489> like<00:02:13.610> that<00:02:13.819> but<00:02:14.480> notepad<00:02:14.930> plus<00:02:15.200> plus<00:02:15.230> is
