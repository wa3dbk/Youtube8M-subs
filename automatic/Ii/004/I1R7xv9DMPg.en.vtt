00:00:16.420 --> 00:00:19.870

00:00:21.700 --> 00:00:26.130
 lately it 's because we have the new 

00:00:23.860 --> 00:00:29.080

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:31.090
 spring / summer 2013 let's talk a 

00:00:29.080 --> 00:00:32.579
 little of the trend that this 

00:00:31.090 --> 00:00:35.219
 collection 

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:37.620
 something that you can not miss in your 

00:00:35.219 --> 00:00:39.780
 closet let's talk about mainly 

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:42.210
 of blouses that are very fashionable in this 

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:44.699
 season as we know is summer what 

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:47.010
 most important to look and you're cool 

00:00:44.699 --> 00:00:49.710
 that look modern and that look very 

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:52.799
 well in them right now in this season 

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:55.649
 it is very fashionable what is white and 

00:00:52.799 --> 00:00:57.780
 the black let's see this blouse the 

00:00:55.649 --> 00:00:59.939
 combination of black and white is very 

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:02.189
 very very fashionable in this collection and 

00:00:59.939 --> 00:01:04.530
 we see how we can combine so much in 

00:01:02.189 --> 00:01:07.259
 lace as we can combine it in 

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:09.630
 prints but always contrasting the 

00:01:07.259 --> 00:01:11.250
 the black and white we will see very very 

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:14.069
 predominant in this season 

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:16.229
 another thing that we're going to see a lot is the 

00:01:14.069 --> 00:01:17.819
 stamped I know that there are many women who 

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:20.970
 we do not like the pattern but I 

00:01:17.819 --> 00:01:23.399
 I invite you to take the chance to try 

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:25.679
 the prints in this case we can see 

00:01:23.399 --> 00:01:28.590
 prints of a single background as is this 

00:01:25.679 --> 00:01:30.840
 yellow and prints that with play 

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:32.789
 forms like flowers that in this case 

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:35.039
 conjugates the yellow with the fuchsia but 

00:01:32.789 --> 00:01:36.960
 It looks very cute because it contrasts 

00:01:35.039 --> 00:01:39.270
 quite are very own colors 

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:42.280
 of the summer because they are strong colors and 

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:44.380
 they make us look spectacular 

00:01:42.280 --> 00:01:47.229
 another piece that is also going to have 

00:01:44.380 --> 00:01:49.869
 quite predominance in this collection 

00:01:47.229 --> 00:01:51.430
 is the white color the white color what 

00:01:49.869 --> 00:01:53.979
 we have to always have in our 

00:01:51.430 --> 00:01:56.080
 blouse I already said it in pants and in 

00:01:53.979 --> 00:01:58.360
 any accessory as we can see 

00:01:56.080 --> 00:02:00.340
 White blouses are going to predominate because 

00:01:58.360 --> 00:02:03.490
 now it's also being used a lot like 

00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:05.770
 we already know the colorful pants and 

00:02:03.490 --> 00:02:08.050
 as the best way we can 

00:02:05.770 --> 00:02:09.280
 combine is with a neutral blouse in the 

00:02:08.050 --> 00:02:11.200
 top part 

00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:13.600
 in this case a white blouse would look 

00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:15.430
 spectacular with mint pants with 

00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:17.860
 a red pants with blue pants 

00:02:15.430 --> 00:02:21.130
 that are also very fashionable then 

00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:23.410
 do not forget we can have several several 

00:02:21.130 --> 00:02:25.390
 white pieces in our closet and 

00:02:23.410 --> 00:02:27.430
 we are always going to look super smart 

00:02:25.390 --> 00:02:31.080
 because white is a color that we 

00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:31.080
 It makes it look very very elegant 

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:36.890
 something also very fashionable is the 

00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:38.750
 lace the lace not necessarily what 

00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:41.450
 we have to use it completely in a 

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:43.610
 blouse but it can be in details like 

00:02:41.450 --> 00:02:46.010
 that this blouse that has the detail of 

00:02:43.610 --> 00:02:49.220
 up nothing else and from the back 

00:02:46.010 --> 00:02:51.020
 that makes it look very delicate not 

00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:54.050
 necessarily generalized but without 

00:02:51.020 --> 00:02:55.700
 focused on certain parts also what 

00:02:54.050 --> 00:02:58.280
 let's see 

00:02:55.700 --> 00:03:01.280
 let's say in this piece that is all the 

00:02:58.280 --> 00:03:03.800
 back of lace and if you are 

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:05.269
 look spectacular you put on a top 

00:03:03.800 --> 00:03:08.900
 true because obviously it's not going to walk 

00:03:05.269 --> 00:03:11.860
 looking everything but you will shine 

00:03:08.900 --> 00:03:14.920
 using the lace 

00:03:11.860 --> 00:03:16.870
 we also have something that has been already 

00:03:14.920 --> 00:03:19.420
 fashion but it will continue to be fashionable in this 

00:03:16.870 --> 00:03:21.700
 season which is the peplum or 

00:03:19.420 --> 00:03:24.100
 known as this little skirt that the 

00:03:21.700 --> 00:03:25.810
 we could see charlize theron in this 

00:03:24.100 --> 00:03:28.360
 delivery of the oscars wearing this 

00:03:25.810 --> 00:03:30.310
 skirt and it looked spectacular today 

00:03:28.360 --> 00:03:32.950
 let's combine with the lace that already 

00:03:30.310 --> 00:03:35.240
 we speak that it looks super nice and 

00:03:32.950 --> 00:03:37.550
 also in black 

00:03:35.240 --> 00:03:40.100
 this highlights our waist and 

00:03:37.550 --> 00:03:41.319
 It will be very fashionable for still a lot 

00:03:40.100 --> 00:03:44.439
 weather 

00:03:41.319 --> 00:03:47.499
 and something that is very very predominant in 

00:03:44.439 --> 00:03:50.620
 this collection is pastel colors 

00:03:47.499 --> 00:03:54.459

00:03:50.620 --> 00:03:56.500

00:04:02.200 --> 00:04:06.340
 that predominate in this collection and 

00:04:04.600 --> 00:04:08.500
 that you definitely have to have 

00:04:06.340 --> 00:04:10.960

00:04:08.500 --> 00:04:13.360
 another trend that also goes for 

00:04:10.960 --> 00:04:16.690
 close but it's very fashionable is that of 

00:04:13.360 --> 00:04:20.079

00:04:16.690 --> 00:04:22.720
 see this cut is perfectly cut 

00:04:20.079 --> 00:04:24.850
 because it's been laser cut and it's 

00:04:22.720 --> 00:04:27.130
 here combined in a body that looks 

00:04:24.850 --> 00:04:29.680
 spectacular but we will also see it 

00:04:27.130 --> 00:04:33.840
 in other types of fabrics such as chiffon 

00:04:29.680 --> 00:04:37.020

00:04:37.020 --> 00:04:42.530

 we also have something that has also 

00:04:42.530 --> 00:04:46.460
 been fashionable in recent months but 

00:04:44.240 --> 00:04:49.700
 that will also go out of fashion and are the 

00:04:46.460 --> 00:04:51.770
 stops or tacks that are these details 

00:04:49.700 --> 00:04:54.050
 that we are going to see them also located 

00:04:51.770 --> 00:04:56.450
 in certain parts not in certain places 

00:04:54.050 --> 00:04:59.300
 of the pieces as in the neck that in

00:04:59.300 --> 00:05:02.330
 striking and you can not use it alone 

00:05:01.070 --> 00:05:04.130
 at night but it is something that also 

00:05:02.330 --> 00:05:07.030
