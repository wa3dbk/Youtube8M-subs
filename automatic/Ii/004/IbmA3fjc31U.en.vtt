it over here these are the easy ones to

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:51.440 
it over here these are the easy ones to
get<00:01:48.960> off<00:01:49.140> you<00:01:49.829> can<00:01:49.979> start<00:01:50.189> working<00:01:50.640> it<00:01:50.820> all<00:01:51.180> the

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:51.450 
get off you can start working it all the

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:53.060 
get off you can start working it all the
way<00:01:51.509> along<00:01:51.780> and<00:01:52.020> then<00:01:52.110> these<00:01:52.380> ones<00:01:52.740> are<00:01:52.979> the

way along and then these ones are the

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:54.980 
way along and then these ones are the
ones<00:01:53.220> that<00:01:53.340> are<00:01:53.490> tough<00:01:53.790> to<00:01:53.970> get<00:01:54.090> off<00:01:54.240> and<00:01:54.869> you

00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:54.990 
ones that are tough to get off and you

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:56.929 
ones that are tough to get off and you
can<00:01:55.079> actually<00:01:55.170> use<00:01:55.409> finger<00:01:55.770> pressure<00:01:56.040> to<00:01:56.640> pop

00:01:56.929 --> 00:01:56.939 
can actually use finger pressure to pop

00:01:56.939 --> 00:01:59.120 
can actually use finger pressure to pop
them<00:01:57.149> and<00:01:57.329> not<00:01:57.780> start<00:01:58.320> digging<00:01:58.680> into<00:01:58.799> this

00:01:59.120 --> 00:01:59.130 
them and not start digging into this

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:01.910 
them and not start digging into this
right<00:01:59.369> here<00:01:59.909> so<00:02:00.810> once<00:02:00.990> you<00:02:01.079> get<00:02:01.200> it<00:02:01.320> out<00:02:01.439> so<00:02:01.649> far

00:02:01.910 --> 00:02:01.920 
right here so once you get it out so far

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:03.709 
right here so once you get it out so far
going<00:02:02.130> to<00:02:02.219> want<00:02:02.369> to<00:02:02.430> pull<00:02:02.640> the<00:02:03.149> handle<00:02:03.540> like<00:02:03.659> so

00:02:03.709 --> 00:02:03.719 
going to want to pull the handle like so

00:02:03.719 --> 00:02:06.560 
going to want to pull the handle like so
and<00:02:04.259> then<00:02:04.860> pull<00:02:05.130> this<00:02:05.310> out<00:02:05.549> and<00:02:06.299> get<00:02:06.479> this

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:06.570 
and then pull this out and get this

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:08.240 
and then pull this out and get this
whole<00:02:06.750> thing<00:02:06.780> all<00:02:07.049> the<00:02:07.140> way<00:02:07.290> and<00:02:07.560> you<00:02:08.039> can<00:02:08.099> see

00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:08.250 
whole thing all the way and you can see

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:09.559 
whole thing all the way and you can see
in<00:02:08.310> the<00:02:08.369> backside<00:02:08.819> here<00:02:08.849> these<00:02:09.119> are<00:02:09.270> two<00:02:09.300> that

00:02:09.559 --> 00:02:09.569 
in the backside here these are two that

00:02:09.569 --> 00:02:12.020 
in the backside here these are two that
push<00:02:09.750> in<00:02:09.959> and<00:02:10.200> down<00:02:10.800> here<00:02:11.310> and<00:02:11.459> these<00:02:11.790> won't

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:12.030 
push in and down here and these won't

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:13.670 
push in and down here and these won't
they<00:02:12.120> start<00:02:12.390> off<00:02:12.629> with<00:02:12.930> that<00:02:13.110> are<00:02:13.230> easier<00:02:13.500> to

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:13.680 
they start off with that are easier to

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:16.580 
they start off with that are easier to
get<00:02:13.769> out<00:02:14.150> now<00:02:15.150> if<00:02:15.510> you<00:02:15.569> the<00:02:15.900> catclaw<00:02:16.260> or<00:02:16.409> not

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:16.590 
get out now if you the catclaw or not

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:18.830 
get out now if you the catclaw or not
you<00:02:16.799> can<00:02:16.950> easily<00:02:17.219> pull<00:02:18.000> up<00:02:18.150> on<00:02:18.359> this

00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:18.840 
you can easily pull up on this

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:21.349 
you can easily pull up on this
you'd<00:02:19.739> be<00:02:19.829> amazed<00:02:20.159> how<00:02:20.370> easy<00:02:20.640> these<00:02:20.879> pop<00:02:21.150> up

00:02:21.349 --> 00:02:21.359 
you'd be amazed how easy these pop up

00:02:21.359 --> 00:02:23.330 
you'd be amazed how easy these pop up
and<00:02:21.569> off<00:02:21.659> here<00:02:21.930> it<00:02:21.989> makes<00:02:22.200> it<00:02:22.379> very<00:02:22.590> very<00:02:22.980> easy

00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:23.340 
and off here it makes it very very easy

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:26.839 
and off here it makes it very very easy
to<00:02:23.640> do<00:02:24.950> next<00:02:25.950> thing<00:02:26.099> you<00:02:26.189> want<00:02:26.340> to<00:02:26.430> do<00:02:26.609> is

00:02:26.839 --> 00:02:26.849 
to do next thing you want to do is

00:02:26.849 --> 00:02:28.880 
to do next thing you want to do is
depending<00:02:27.540> on<00:02:27.569> what<00:02:27.750> kind<00:02:27.870> of<00:02:28.019> connections

00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:28.890 
depending on what kind of connections

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:31.990 
depending on what kind of connections
you<00:02:29.040> have<00:02:29.069> on<00:02:29.340> here<00:02:29.579> for<00:02:30.389> your<00:02:30.480> mirrors<00:02:31.049> or

00:02:31.990 --> 00:02:32.000 
you have on here for your mirrors or

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:34.099 
you have on here for your mirrors or
door<00:02:33.000> locks<00:02:33.389> of<00:02:33.599> course<00:02:33.780> you're<00:02:33.930> going<00:02:34.049> to

00:02:34.099 --> 00:02:34.109 
door locks of course you're going to

00:02:34.109 --> 00:02:36.530 
door locks of course you're going to
have<00:02:34.170> this<00:02:34.709> one<00:02:34.920> unclip<00:02:35.400> them<00:02:35.549> all<00:02:35.730> and<00:02:36.060> then

00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:36.540 
have this one unclip them all and then

00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:39.289 
have this one unclip them all and then
of<00:02:36.659> course<00:02:36.689> your<00:02:37.500> two<00:02:37.709> wires<00:02:38.090> which<00:02:39.090> are<00:02:39.209> going

00:02:39.289 --> 00:02:39.299 
of course your two wires which are going

00:02:39.299 --> 00:02:42.349 
of course your two wires which are going
to<00:02:39.389> be<00:02:39.450> heavy-duty<00:02:40.849> for<00:02:41.849> your<00:02:41.969> window<00:02:42.180> switch

00:02:42.349 --> 00:02:42.359 
to be heavy-duty for your window switch

00:02:42.359 --> 00:02:45.170 
to be heavy-duty for your window switch
itself<00:02:42.829> and<00:02:43.829> it's<00:02:44.189> best<00:02:44.400> for<00:02:44.609> these<00:02:44.819> these

00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:45.180 
itself and it's best for these these

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:46.789 
itself and it's best for these these
heavy-duty<00:02:45.480> ones<00:02:45.840> with<00:02:46.109> the<00:02:46.230> wires<00:02:46.470> and<00:02:46.709> all

00:02:46.789 --> 00:02:46.799 
heavy-duty ones with the wires and all

00:02:46.799 --> 00:02:48.259 
heavy-duty ones with the wires and all
that<00:02:47.010> they're<00:02:47.519> going<00:02:47.669> to<00:02:47.730> a<00:02:47.760> lot<00:02:47.939> of<00:02:48.030> spring

00:02:48.259 --> 00:02:48.269 
that they're going to a lot of spring

00:02:48.269 --> 00:02:50.059 
that they're going to a lot of spring
tension<00:02:48.720> on<00:02:48.930> those<00:02:49.109> on<00:02:49.349> those<00:02:49.379> tension<00:02:49.950> and

00:02:50.059 --> 00:02:50.069 
tension on those on those tension and

00:02:50.069 --> 00:02:52.250 
tension on those on those tension and
those<00:02:50.220> terminals<00:02:50.909> in<00:02:51.030> there<00:02:51.209> which<00:02:51.959> one<00:02:52.139> I<00:02:52.169> do

00:02:52.250 --> 00:02:52.260 
those terminals in there which one I do

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:54.679 
those terminals in there which one I do
is<00:02:52.500> push<00:02:52.769> in<00:02:52.950> on<00:02:53.159> the<00:02:53.250> connector<00:02:53.700> release<00:02:54.450> it

00:02:54.679 --> 00:02:54.689 
is push in on the connector release it

00:02:54.689 --> 00:02:57.020 
is push in on the connector release it
right<00:02:54.810> here<00:02:55.049> push<00:02:55.260> in<00:02:55.470> that<00:02:55.680> and<00:02:55.859> then<00:02:56.579> pull<00:02:56.909> it

00:02:57.020 --> 00:02:57.030 
right here push in that and then pull it

00:02:57.030 --> 00:02:59.890 
right here push in that and then pull it
off<00:02:57.209> something<00:02:57.750> like<00:02:57.870> this<00:02:58.430> push<00:02:59.430> it<00:02:59.609> in

00:02:59.890 --> 00:02:59.900 
off something like this push it in

00:02:59.900 --> 00:03:08.659 
off something like this push it in
release<00:03:00.900> tension<00:03:01.409> and<00:03:06.620> get<00:03:07.620> it<00:03:07.709> off<00:03:07.859> it's<00:03:08.400> kind

00:03:08.659 --> 00:03:08.669 
release tension and get it off it's kind

00:03:08.669 --> 00:03:10.369 
release tension and get it off it's kind
of<00:03:08.730> hard<00:03:08.909> to<00:03:08.939> do<00:03:09.150> because<00:03:09.659> there's<00:03:09.959> so<00:03:10.230> many

00:03:10.369 --> 00:03:10.379 
of hard to do because there's so many

00:03:10.379 --> 00:03:12.530 
of hard to do because there's so many
terminals<00:03:10.709> inside<00:03:11.280> of<00:03:11.459> here<00:03:11.760> and<00:03:11.879> your

00:03:12.530 --> 00:03:12.540 
terminals inside of here and your

00:03:12.540 --> 00:03:14.479 
terminals inside of here and your
thicker<00:03:12.840> gauge<00:03:13.079> wire<00:03:13.409> so<00:03:13.739> it<00:03:13.799> like<00:03:13.950> sticks<00:03:14.310> in

00:03:14.479 --> 00:03:14.489 
thicker gauge wire so it like sticks in

00:03:14.489 --> 00:03:16.550 
thicker gauge wire so it like sticks in
there<00:03:14.700> okay<00:03:15.629> so<00:03:15.689> let's<00:03:15.900> get<00:03:15.989> this<00:03:16.109> trim<00:03:16.349> panel

00:03:16.550 --> 00:03:16.560 
there okay so let's get this trim panel

00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:19.129 
there okay so let's get this trim panel
and<00:03:16.950> switch<00:03:17.280> away<00:03:17.699> from<00:03:17.879> the<00:03:18.090> door<00:03:18.389> we<00:03:18.989> can

00:03:19.129 --> 00:03:19.139 
and switch away from the door we can

00:03:19.139 --> 00:03:20.449 
and switch away from the door we can
start<00:03:19.349> working<00:03:19.500> on<00:03:19.650> getting<00:03:19.949> it<00:03:20.040> out<00:03:20.220> of<00:03:20.370> here

00:03:20.449 --> 00:03:20.459 
start working on getting it out of here

00:03:20.459 --> 00:03:21.920 
start working on getting it out of here
and<00:03:20.549> separating<00:03:21.090> it<00:03:21.180> from<00:03:21.209> the<00:03:21.479> trim<00:03:21.780> panel

00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:21.930 
and separating it from the trim panel

00:03:21.930 --> 00:03:23.539 
and separating it from the trim panel
we're<00:03:22.440> going<00:03:22.560> to<00:03:22.650> everything<00:03:23.310> from<00:03:23.459> the

00:03:23.539 --> 00:03:23.549 
we're going to everything from the

00:03:23.549 --> 00:03:26.000 
we're going to everything from the
backside<00:03:24.030> here<00:03:24.060> and<00:03:24.569> keep<00:03:25.409> the<00:03:25.530> front<00:03:25.739> from

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:26.010 
backside here and keep the front from

00:03:26.010 --> 00:03:26.869 
backside here and keep the front from
getting<00:03:26.310> damaged

now<00:03:27.389> there's<00:03:27.659> four<00:03:28.069> points<00:03:29.069> on<00:03:29.189> here<00:03:29.430> where<00:03:29.639> it

00:03:29.719 --> 00:03:29.729 
now there's four points on here where it

00:03:29.729 --> 00:03:31.729 
now there's four points on here where it
actually<00:03:29.879> clips<00:03:30.449> in<00:03:30.659> it<00:03:30.810> there<00:03:30.989> that's<00:03:31.470> all<00:03:31.650> it

I'm out here and once you get all four

00:04:31.980 --> 00:04:34.100 
I'm out here and once you get all four
of<00:04:32.010> them<00:04:32.250> release<00:04:32.850> like<00:04:33.120> that<00:04:33.390> you<00:04:34.080> just

00:04:34.100 --> 00:04:34.110 
of them release like that you just

00:04:34.110 --> 00:04:37.550 
of them release like that you just
simply<00:04:34.680> press<00:04:34.980> through<00:04:35.660> pull<00:04:36.660> through<00:04:36.690> and<00:04:37.260> it

00:04:37.550 --> 00:04:37.560 
simply press through pull through and it

00:04:37.560 --> 00:04:40.660 
simply press through pull through and it
comes<00:04:37.770> right<00:04:37.950> out<00:04:38.420> it's<00:04:39.420> that<00:04:39.660> simple

00:04:40.660 --> 00:04:40.670 
comes right out it's that simple

00:04:40.670 --> 00:04:42.830 
comes right out it's that simple
you<00:04:41.670> just<00:04:41.850> don't<00:04:42.030> want<00:04:42.150> to<00:04:42.180> pry<00:04:42.360> too<00:04:42.420> much

00:04:42.830 --> 00:04:42.840 
you just don't want to pry too much

00:04:42.840 --> 00:04:43.970 
you just don't want to pry too much
because<00:04:43.110> they<00:04:43.230> might<00:04:43.350> start<00:04:43.530> breaking<00:04:43.920> these

00:04:43.970 --> 00:04:43.980 
because they might start breaking these

00:04:43.980 --> 00:04:46.190 
because they might start breaking these
off<00:04:44.220> on<00:04:44.460> here<00:04:44.730> and<00:04:45.060> we'll<00:04:45.390> clip<00:04:45.660> in<00:04:45.810> nice<00:04:45.990> and

00:04:46.190 --> 00:04:46.200 
off on here and we'll clip in nice and

00:04:46.200 --> 00:04:48.350 
off on here and we'll clip in nice and
tight<00:04:46.260> whereas<00:04:47.070> right<00:04:47.220> now<00:04:47.280> now<00:04:48.060> these<00:04:48.210> are

00:04:48.350 --> 00:04:48.360 
tight whereas right now now these are

00:04:48.360 --> 00:04:50.540 
tight whereas right now now these are
broken<00:04:48.480> and<00:04:48.840> always<00:04:49.470> aligning<00:04:49.800> tabs<00:04:50.130> are<00:04:50.310> in

00:04:50.540 --> 00:04:50.550 
broken and always aligning tabs are in

00:04:50.550 --> 00:04:52.640 
broken and always aligning tabs are in
place<00:04:50.880> so<00:04:51.480> it'll<00:04:51.690> snap<00:04:51.900> in<00:04:51.960> nice<00:04:52.230> and<00:04:52.440> tight

00:04:52.640 --> 00:04:52.650 
place so it'll snap in nice and tight

00:04:52.650 --> 00:04:54.710 
place so it'll snap in nice and tight
my<00:04:53.430> wife<00:04:53.610> clean<00:04:53.850> this<00:04:53.940> area<00:04:54.270> here<00:04:54.450> a<00:04:54.480> little

bit<00:04:54.870> it<00:04:55.860> has<00:04:55.920> a<00:04:56.010> lot<00:04:56.190> of<00:04:56.220> Brianna<00:04:56.640> usually<00:04:57.090> from

00:04:57.290 --> 00:04:57.300 
bit it has a lot of Brianna usually from

00:04:57.300 --> 00:04:59.810 
bit it has a lot of Brianna usually from
the<00:04:57.360> old<00:04:57.570> one<00:04:57.720> and<00:04:58.400> then<00:04:59.400> your<00:04:59.520> new<00:04:59.640> one

00:04:59.820 --> 00:05:02.030 
the old one and then your new one
obviously<00:05:00.570> just<00:05:01.200> snaps<00:05:01.560> right<00:05:01.710> into<00:05:01.980> place

00:05:02.030 --> 00:05:02.040 
obviously just snaps right into place

00:05:02.040 --> 00:05:06.190 
obviously just snaps right into place
when<00:05:02.940> it<00:05:03.030> goes<00:05:03.180> one<00:05:03.450> way<00:05:04.550> goes<00:05:05.550> in<00:05:05.730> like<00:05:05.880> that

00:05:06.190 --> 00:05:06.200 
when it goes one way goes in like that

00:05:06.200 --> 00:05:09.280 
when it goes one way goes in like that
and<00:05:07.200> I<00:05:07.500> go<00:05:07.590> from<00:05:07.740> I<00:05:07.950> go<00:05:08.070> from<00:05:08.250> top<00:05:08.430> and<00:05:08.460> bottom

00:05:09.280 --> 00:05:09.290 
and I go from I go from top and bottom

00:05:09.290 --> 00:05:12.290 
and I go from I go from top and bottom
squeeze<00:05:10.290> evenly<00:05:10.740> and<00:05:11.400> I'll<00:05:11.550> pop<00:05:11.760> in<00:05:12.000> just<00:05:12.120> like

00:05:12.290 --> 00:05:12.300 
squeeze evenly and I'll pop in just like

00:05:12.300 --> 00:05:16.490 
squeeze evenly and I'll pop in just like
that<00:05:12.360> all<00:05:12.750> for<00:05:13.130> not<00:05:14.130> a<00:05:14.160> problem<00:05:15.170> now<00:05:16.170> going

00:05:16.490 --> 00:05:16.500 
that all for not a problem now going

00:05:18.580 --> 00:05:18.590 
back together its reversal of removal

00:05:18.590 --> 00:05:21.460 
back together its reversal of removal
whereas<00:05:19.590> I<00:05:19.710> put<00:05:19.860> all<00:05:19.950> our<00:05:19.980> connectors<00:05:20.490> back<00:05:20.790> in

00:05:21.460 --> 00:05:21.470 
whereas I put all our connectors back in

00:05:21.470 --> 00:05:26.090 
whereas I put all our connectors back in
until<00:05:22.470> they<00:05:22.560> clip<00:05:22.830> like<00:05:23.040> that<00:05:24.650> and<00:05:25.650> you<00:05:25.740> listen

00:05:26.090 --> 00:05:26.100 
until they clip like that and you listen

00:05:26.100 --> 00:05:28.280 
until they clip like that and you listen
for<00:05:26.280> that<00:05:26.400> feel<00:05:26.760> for<00:05:27.060> it<00:05:27.210> so<00:05:27.990> we<00:05:28.050> know<00:05:28.170> they

00:05:28.280 --> 00:05:28.290 
for that feel for it so we know they

00:05:28.290 --> 00:05:33.410 
for that feel for it so we know they
won't<00:05:28.380> come<00:05:28.560> out<00:05:28.680> in<00:05:28.770> the<00:05:28.830> future<00:05:30.740> and<00:05:32.300> then<00:05:33.300> it

00:05:33.410 --> 00:05:33.420 
won't come out in the future and then it

00:05:33.420 --> 00:05:36.100 
won't come out in the future and then it
should<00:05:33.540> all<00:05:33.720> just<00:05:34.200> lay<00:05:34.500> right<00:05:34.770> back<00:05:35.010> down<00:05:35.280> here

00:05:36.100 --> 00:05:36.110 
should all just lay right back down here

00:05:36.110 --> 00:05:41.420 
should all just lay right back down here
perfectly<00:05:38.300> it's<00:05:39.300> like<00:05:39.510> that<00:05:40.010> and<00:05:41.010> the<00:05:41.220> same

00:05:41.420 --> 00:05:41.430 
perfectly it's like that and the same

00:05:41.430 --> 00:05:42.980 
perfectly it's like that and the same
thing<00:05:41.580> with<00:05:41.700> this<00:05:41.910> we're<00:05:42.600> going<00:05:42.720> to<00:05:42.810> open<00:05:42.870> our

00:05:42.980 --> 00:05:42.990 
thing with this we're going to open our

00:05:42.990 --> 00:05:44.810 
thing with this we're going to open our
door<00:05:43.200> handle<00:05:43.590> we're<00:05:44.160> going<00:05:44.310> to<00:05:44.400> slide<00:05:44.700> it

00:05:44.810 --> 00:05:44.820 
door handle we're going to slide it

00:05:44.820 --> 00:05:48.260 
door handle we're going to slide it
through<00:05:44.850> and<00:05:45.620> let<00:05:46.620> go<00:05:46.770> of<00:05:46.920> that<00:05:47.070> where<00:05:47.970> I<00:05:48.000> start

00:05:48.260 --> 00:05:48.270 
through and let go of that where I start

00:05:48.270 --> 00:05:51.010 
through and let go of that where I start
from<00:05:48.360> back<00:05:48.540> here<00:05:48.960> and<00:05:49.140> work<00:05:49.410> our<00:05:49.530> way<00:05:49.620> forward

00:05:51.010 --> 00:05:51.020 
from back here and work our way forward

00:05:51.020 --> 00:05:54.650 
from back here and work our way forward
pretty<00:05:52.020> much<00:05:52.230> once<00:05:52.920> it's<00:05:53.130> in<00:05:53.280> there<00:05:53.540> it<00:05:54.540> all

00:05:54.650 --> 00:05:54.660 
pretty much once it's in there it all

00:05:54.660 --> 00:05:58.760 
pretty much once it's in there it all
self<00:05:55.020> aligns<00:05:55.410> just<00:05:56.070> go<00:05:56.250> over<00:05:57.290> real<00:05:58.290> quick<00:05:58.560> make

00:05:58.760 --> 00:05:58.770 
self aligns just go over real quick make

00:05:58.770 --> 00:06:01.010 
self aligns just go over real quick make
sure<00:05:58.890> it's<00:05:58.980> all<00:05:59.070> back<00:05:59.190> together<00:05:59.370> and<00:05:59.820> then<00:06:00.420> we

00:06:01.010 --> 00:06:01.020 
sure it's all back together and then we

00:06:01.020 --> 00:06:03.350 
sure it's all back together and then we
can<00:06:01.170> turn<00:06:01.410> the<00:06:01.740> ignition<00:06:01.980> on<00:06:02.430> and<00:06:02.700> the<00:06:03.150> lights

00:06:03.350 --> 00:06:03.360 
can turn the ignition on and the lights

00:06:03.360 --> 00:06:05.840 
can turn the ignition on and the lights
on<00:06:03.600> and<00:06:03.960> we<00:06:04.230> can<00:06:04.380> check<00:06:04.710> and<00:06:05.010> make<00:06:05.490> sure<00:06:05.520> all

00:06:05.840 --> 00:06:05.850 
on and we can check and make sure all

00:06:05.850 --> 00:06:09.680 
on and we can check and make sure all
these<00:06:06.090> light<00:06:06.330> back<00:06:06.540> up<00:06:06.750> and<00:06:07.760> there<00:06:08.760> it<00:06:08.880> is<00:06:09.090> our

00:06:09.680 --> 00:06:09.690 
these light back up and there it is our

00:06:09.690 --> 00:06:11.330 
these light back up and there it is our
backlighting<00:06:10.290> on<00:06:10.350> a<00:06:10.440> switch<00:06:10.710> works<00:06:10.950> once

00:06:11.330 --> 00:06:11.340 
backlighting on a switch works once

00:06:11.340 --> 00:06:13.850 
backlighting on a switch works once
again<00:06:11.700> you<00:06:12.660> mean<00:06:12.810> I<00:06:12.930> realize<00:06:13.350> how<00:06:13.530> much<00:06:13.650> this

00:06:13.850 --> 00:06:13.860 
again you mean I realize how much this

00:06:13.860 --> 00:06:15.230 
again you mean I realize how much this
actually<00:06:14.040> helps<00:06:14.580> when<00:06:14.850> you're<00:06:14.970> trying<00:06:15.120> to

00:06:15.230 --> 00:06:15.240 
actually helps when you're trying to

00:06:15.240 --> 00:06:16.760 
actually helps when you're trying to
find<00:06:15.420> that<00:06:15.630> switch<00:06:15.900> and<00:06:16.080> a<00:06:16.140> dark<00:06:16.350> one<00:06:16.530> on<00:06:16.680> the

00:06:16.760 --> 00:06:16.770 
find that switch and a dark one on the

00:06:16.770 --> 00:06:19.040 
find that switch and a dark one on the
road<00:06:16.980> once<00:06:17.910> it<00:06:18.030> goes<00:06:18.150> out<00:06:18.390> you<00:06:18.510> realize<00:06:19.020> just

00:06:19.040 --> 00:06:19.050 
road once it goes out you realize just

00:06:19.050 --> 00:06:21.440 
road once it goes out you realize just
how<00:06:19.530> nice<00:06:19.980> it<00:06:20.220> is<00:06:20.310> have<00:06:20.610> that<00:06:20.730> backlighting<00:06:21.360> in

00:06:21.440 --> 00:06:21.450 
how nice it is have that backlighting in

00:06:21.450 --> 00:06:23.210 
how nice it is have that backlighting in
there

00:06:23.210 --> 00:06:23.220 
there

00:06:23.220 --> 00:06:24.410 
there
all<00:06:23.280> right<00:06:23.400> so<00:06:23.490> hopefully<00:06:23.790> you're<00:06:23.940> about<00:06:24.210> just

00:06:26.420 --> 00:06:26.430 
as well as mine did this is a very

00:06:26.430 --> 00:06:28.250 
as well as mine did this is a very
simple<00:06:26.880> process<00:06:27.210> but<00:06:27.540> may<00:06:27.750> look<00:06:27.960> intimidating

00:06:28.250 --> 00:06:28.260 
simple process but may look intimidating

00:06:28.260 --> 00:06:29.990 
simple process but may look intimidating
especially<00:06:28.860> because<00:06:29.490> you<00:06:29.670> don't<00:06:29.790> want<00:06:29.910> to
