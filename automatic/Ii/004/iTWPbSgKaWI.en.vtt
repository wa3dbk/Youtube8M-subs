to<00:04:11.500> warm<00:04:11.769> up<00:04:12.189> I'll<00:04:12.250> campus<00:04:12.819> up<00:04:13.000> and<00:04:13.209> down<00:04:13.329> a<00:04:13.360> few

00:04:13.649 --> 00:04:13.659 
to warm up I'll campus up and down a few

00:04:13.659 --> 00:04:24.300 
to warm up I'll campus up and down a few
times<00:04:13.900> with<00:04:14.409> that<00:04:14.560> matching<00:04:22.710> then<00:04:23.710> a<00:04:24.009> movie

00:04:24.300 --> 00:04:24.310 
times with that matching then a movie

00:04:24.310 --> 00:04:28.010 
times with that matching then a movie
Qian<00:04:24.729> up<00:04:24.970> and<00:04:25.180> down<00:04:25.360> while<00:04:25.780> skipping<00:04:26.050> a<00:04:26.289> run

00:04:28.010 --> 00:04:28.020 
Qian up and down while skipping a run

00:04:28.020 --> 00:04:32.760 
Qian up and down while skipping a run
but<00:04:29.020> my<00:04:29.199> favorite<00:04:29.650> are<00:04:29.889> the<00:04:30.130> lock<00:04:30.340> off<00:04:31.770> you

00:04:32.760 --> 00:04:32.770 
but my favorite are the lock off you

00:04:32.770 --> 00:04:34.980 
but my favorite are the lock off you
bump<00:04:33.009> one<00:04:33.280> hand<00:04:33.520> up<00:04:33.729> and<00:04:33.970> so<00:04:34.210> you<00:04:34.330> can't<00:04:34.570> go<00:04:34.780> any

00:04:34.980 --> 00:04:34.990 
bump one hand up and so you can't go any

00:04:34.990 --> 00:04:39.659 
bump one hand up and so you can't go any
higher<00:04:35.080> then<00:04:35.830> come<00:04:36.070> back<00:04:36.100> down<00:04:38.280> when<00:04:39.280> our<00:04:39.430> gym

00:04:39.659 --> 00:04:39.669 
higher then come back down when our gym

00:04:39.669 --> 00:04:41.490 
higher then come back down when our gym
put<00:04:39.850> up<00:04:40.000> the<00:04:40.150> campus<00:04:40.509> board<00:04:40.750> a<00:04:40.900> few<00:04:41.050> months<00:04:41.380> ago

00:04:41.490 --> 00:04:41.500 
put up the campus board a few months ago

00:04:41.500 --> 00:04:45.560 
put up the campus board a few months ago
I<00:04:41.889> can't<00:04:42.220> do<00:04:42.639> a<00:04:42.669> single<00:04:43.150> double<00:04:43.330> clutch<00:04:43.750> I

00:04:45.560 --> 00:04:45.570 
I can't do a single double clutch I

00:04:45.570 --> 00:04:47.640 
I can't do a single double clutch I
guess<00:04:46.570> there<00:04:46.780> must<00:04:46.900> be<00:04:47.110> a<00:04:47.139> pretty<00:04:47.440> big

00:04:47.640 --> 00:04:47.650 
guess there must be a pretty big

00:04:47.650 --> 00:04:49.680 
guess there must be a pretty big
learning<00:04:48.070> curve<00:04:48.100> because<00:04:48.760> I<00:04:49.000> was<00:04:49.120> able<00:04:49.270> to<00:04:49.419> do

00:04:49.680 --> 00:04:49.690 
learning curve because I was able to do

00:04:49.690 --> 00:05:13.379 
learning curve because I was able to do
five<00:04:49.960> by<00:04:50.289> then<00:04:50.500> in<00:04:50.650> my<00:04:50.770> fourth<00:04:51.070> session
