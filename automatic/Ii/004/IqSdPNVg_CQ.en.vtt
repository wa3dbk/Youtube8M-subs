00:02:11.290 --> 00:02:12.780 
works now the speaker doesn't actually
have<00:02:11.590> volume<00:02:11.920> control<00:02:12.010> on<00:02:12.250> its<00:02:12.459> own<00:02:12.549> so<00:02:12.670> you

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:12.790 
have volume control on its own so you

00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:14.220 
have volume control on its own so you
actually<00:02:12.970> have<00:02:13.120> to<00:02:13.239> use<00:02:13.269> the<00:02:13.480> device<00:02:13.780> to

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:14.230 
actually have to use the device to

00:02:14.230 --> 00:02:16.170 
actually have to use the device to
control<00:02:14.410> the<00:02:14.709> volume<00:02:14.860> itself<00:02:15.340> that's<00:02:15.970> not<00:02:16.150> a

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:16.180 
control the volume itself that's not a

00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:17.670 
control the volume itself that's not a
problem<00:02:16.269> because<00:02:16.629> most<00:02:16.989> portable<00:02:17.349> devices

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:17.680 
problem because most portable devices

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:20.190 
problem because most portable devices
have<00:02:17.950> its<00:02:18.069> own<00:02:18.160> body<00:02:18.430> control<00:02:18.900> now<00:02:19.900> it<00:02:20.080> is<00:02:20.170> a

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:20.200 
have its own body control now it is a

00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:22.170 
have its own body control now it is a
portable<00:02:20.620> speaker<00:02:21.040> so<00:02:21.280> the<00:02:21.519> sound<00:02:21.700> quality<00:02:21.910> is

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:22.180 
portable speaker so the sound quality is

00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:24.509 
portable speaker so the sound quality is
going<00:02:22.360> to<00:02:22.420> be<00:02:22.480> that<00:02:22.870> great<00:02:23.140> but<00:02:23.680> compared<00:02:24.310> to<00:02:24.489> a

00:02:24.509 --> 00:02:24.519 
going to be that great but compared to a

00:02:24.519 --> 00:02:26.580 
going to be that great but compared to a
regular<00:02:24.580> laptop<00:02:25.060> speaker<00:02:25.720> this<00:02:26.110> is<00:02:26.260> actually

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:26.590 
regular laptop speaker this is actually

00:02:26.590 --> 00:02:28.350 
regular laptop speaker this is actually
pretty<00:02:26.769> good<00:02:27.010> it<00:02:27.700> doesn't<00:02:28.030> have<00:02:28.120> a<00:02:28.150> lot<00:02:28.330> of

00:02:28.350 --> 00:02:28.360 
pretty good it doesn't have a lot of

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:30.869 
pretty good it doesn't have a lot of
bass<00:02:28.660> and<00:02:28.989> it<00:02:29.440> has<00:02:29.590> a<00:02:29.620> little<00:02:30.099> bit<00:02:30.430> of<00:02:30.489> a<00:02:30.640> tinny

00:02:30.869 --> 00:02:30.879 
bass and it has a little bit of a tinny

00:02:30.879 --> 00:02:32.910 
bass and it has a little bit of a tinny
sound<00:02:30.970> but<00:02:31.480> it's<00:02:31.930> probably<00:02:32.200> better<00:02:32.500> than<00:02:32.680> the

00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:32.920 
sound but it's probably better than the

00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:35.400 
sound but it's probably better than the
majority<00:02:32.980> of<00:02:33.400> laptop<00:02:33.879> speakers<00:02:34.329> and<00:02:34.540> since

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:35.410 
majority of laptop speakers and since

00:02:35.410 --> 00:02:37.710 
majority of laptop speakers and since
it's<00:02:35.530> so<00:02:35.650> portable<00:02:36.299> fits<00:02:37.299> right<00:02:37.510> into<00:02:37.660> a

00:02:37.710 --> 00:02:37.720 
it's so portable fits right into a

00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:40.319 
it's so portable fits right into a
laptop<00:02:38.140> bag<00:02:38.379> see<00:02:38.739> how<00:02:38.829> thin<00:02:39.099> it<00:02:39.190> is<00:02:39.329> it's

00:02:40.319 --> 00:02:40.329 
laptop bag see how thin it is it's

00:02:40.329 --> 00:02:42.059 
laptop bag see how thin it is it's
pretty<00:02:40.599> good<00:02:40.810> speaker<00:02:41.170> to<00:02:41.290> carry<00:02:41.530> with<00:02:41.739> you<00:02:41.920> in

00:02:42.059 --> 00:02:42.069 
pretty good speaker to carry with you in

00:02:42.069 --> 00:02:43.589 
pretty good speaker to carry with you in
addition<00:02:42.489> to<00:02:42.610> the<00:02:42.700> ones<00:02:42.910> on<00:02:43.060> your<00:02:43.209> laptop

00:02:43.589 --> 00:02:43.599 
addition to the ones on your laptop

00:02:43.599 --> 00:02:46.589 
addition to the ones on your laptop
already<00:02:44.069> once<00:02:45.069> you're<00:02:45.220> done<00:02:45.459> with<00:02:45.519> the<00:02:46.030> audio

00:02:46.589 --> 00:02:46.599 
already once you're done with the audio

00:02:46.599 --> 00:02:49.050 
already once you're done with the audio
cable<00:02:47.049> you<00:02:47.170> just<00:02:47.500> wrap<00:02:47.799> it<00:02:48.010> back<00:02:48.190> inside<00:02:48.819> the

00:02:49.050 --> 00:02:49.060 
cable you just wrap it back inside the

00:02:49.060 --> 00:02:52.830 
cable you just wrap it back inside the
unit<00:02:49.569> itself<00:02:49.690> and<00:02:50.349> it<00:02:51.099> locks<00:02:51.370> into<00:02:51.670> place<00:02:51.910> so

00:02:52.830 --> 00:02:52.840 
unit itself and it locks into place so

00:02:52.840 --> 00:02:55.349 
unit itself and it locks into place so
it<00:02:52.959> stores<00:02:53.200> very<00:02:53.500> easily<00:02:53.769> like<00:02:54.459> so<00:02:54.790> you<00:02:55.269> can

00:02:55.349 --> 00:02:55.359 
it stores very easily like so you can

00:02:55.359 --> 00:02:57.449 
it stores very easily like so you can
see<00:02:55.599> here<00:02:56.230> and<00:02:56.440> it<00:02:56.530> wraps<00:02:56.769> around<00:02:56.920> the<00:02:57.250> edges

00:02:57.449 --> 00:02:57.459 
see here and it wraps around the edges

00:02:57.459 --> 00:03:00.690 
see here and it wraps around the edges
right<00:02:57.849> here<00:02:58.379> so<00:02:59.379> that's<00:02:59.590> that<00:02:59.799> so<00:03:00.160> it<00:03:00.459> stores

00:03:00.690 --> 00:03:00.700 
right here so that's that so it stores

00:03:00.700 --> 00:03:02.880 
right here so that's that so it stores
very<00:03:01.000> easily<00:03:01.239> and<00:03:01.480> it's<00:03:02.019> very<00:03:02.230> portable<00:03:02.620> as

00:03:02.880 --> 00:03:02.890 
very easily and it's very portable as

00:03:02.890 --> 00:03:05.099 
very easily and it's very portable as
well<00:03:03.099> now<00:03:03.730> some<00:03:04.000> people<00:03:04.150> might<00:03:04.329> balk<00:03:04.780> at<00:03:04.989> the

00:03:05.099 --> 00:03:05.109 
well now some people might balk at the

00:03:05.109 --> 00:03:08.610 
well now some people might balk at the
$25<00:03:05.889> MSRP<00:03:06.400> of<00:03:06.639> this<00:03:07.090> device<00:03:07.389> but<00:03:07.810> if<00:03:08.079> you<00:03:08.380> need

00:03:08.610 --> 00:03:08.620 
$25 MSRP of this device but if you need

00:03:08.620 --> 00:03:10.770 
$25 MSRP of this device but if you need
portable<00:03:09.040> speakers<00:03:09.579> this<00:03:10.060> is<00:03:10.239> a<00:03:10.269> pretty<00:03:10.540> good

00:03:10.770 --> 00:03:10.780 
portable speakers this is a pretty good

00:03:10.780 --> 00:03:13.800 
portable speakers this is a pretty good
kit<00:03:11.079> it's<00:03:11.620> $25<00:03:12.459> MSRP<00:03:12.849> which<00:03:13.150> means<00:03:13.359> the<00:03:13.480> retail

00:03:13.800 --> 00:03:13.810 
kit it's $25 MSRP which means the retail

00:03:13.810 --> 00:03:15.240 
kit it's $25 MSRP which means the retail
should<00:03:13.989> be<00:03:14.079> a<00:03:14.109> little<00:03:14.380> bit<00:03:14.530> cheaper<00:03:14.889> than<00:03:15.010> that

00:03:15.240 --> 00:03:15.250 
should be a little bit cheaper than that

00:03:15.250 --> 00:03:18.089 
should be a little bit cheaper than that
but<00:03:16.060> majority<00:03:16.660> users<00:03:17.260> probably<00:03:17.650> won't<00:03:17.889> bother

00:03:18.089 --> 00:03:18.099 
but majority users probably won't bother

00:03:18.099 --> 00:03:19.440 
but majority users probably won't bother
getting<00:03:18.400> something<00:03:18.730> like<00:03:18.910> this<00:03:19.030> because<00:03:19.209> the
