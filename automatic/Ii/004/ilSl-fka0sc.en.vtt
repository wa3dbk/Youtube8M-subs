at<00:03:49.510> it

00:03:49.890 --> 00:03:49.900 
at it

00:03:49.900 --> 00:03:52.800 
at it
and<00:03:50.560> she'll<00:03:50.799> do<00:03:51.099> like<00:03:51.760> you<00:03:52.120> know<00:03:52.269> almost<00:03:52.659> like

00:03:52.800 --> 00:03:52.810 
and she'll do like you know almost like

00:03:52.810 --> 00:03:56.009 
and she'll do like you know almost like
a<00:03:52.840> like<00:03:53.319> jagged<00:03:53.980> edges<00:03:54.310> you<00:03:55.120> know<00:03:55.269> not<00:03:55.690> the

00:03:56.009 --> 00:03:56.019 
a like jagged edges you know not the

00:03:56.019 --> 00:03:58.289 
a like jagged edges you know not the
lunch<00:03:56.260> not<00:03:56.530> straight<00:03:57.069> it's<00:03:57.580> more<00:03:57.819> like<00:03:58.000> jagged
