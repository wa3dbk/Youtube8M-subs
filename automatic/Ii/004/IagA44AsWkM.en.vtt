because<00:01:19.140> a<00:01:19.260> lot<00:01:19.440> of<00:01:19.470> these<00:01:19.620> girls<00:01:19.830> are<00:01:20.100> just

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:20.280 
because a lot of these girls are just

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:22.820 
because a lot of these girls are just
like<00:01:20.610> either<00:01:20.940> just<00:01:21.270> technical<00:01:21.780> or<00:01:22.080> they're

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:22.830 
like either just technical or they're

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:24.500 
like either just technical or they're
used<00:01:23.010> to<00:01:23.100> one<00:01:23.280> style<00:01:23.549> and<00:01:23.820> this<00:01:24.000> intensive

00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:24.510 
used to one style and this intensive

00:01:24.510 --> 00:01:26.539 
used to one style and this intensive
allows<00:01:24.900> us<00:01:25.110> to<00:01:25.260> get<00:01:25.409> dip<00:01:25.920> into<00:01:26.100> a<00:01:26.250> little<00:01:26.460> bit

00:01:26.539 --> 00:01:26.549 
allows us to get dip into a little bit

00:01:26.549 --> 00:01:27.680 
allows us to get dip into a little bit
of<00:01:26.640> each<00:01:26.760> style<00:01:26.970> I<00:01:27.180> think<00:01:27.210> that's<00:01:27.479> really

00:01:27.680 --> 00:01:27.690 
of each style I think that's really

00:01:27.690 --> 00:01:28.660 
of each style I think that's really
great

00:01:28.660 --> 00:01:28.670 
great

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:31.070 
great
each<00:01:29.670> Coast<00:01:30.060> is<00:01:30.270> doing<00:01:30.479> something<00:01:30.659> different

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:34.310 
the Midwest is doing something
completely<00:01:33.000> different<00:01:33.690> and<00:01:33.869> I<00:01:33.930> think<00:01:33.990> that

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:34.320 
completely different and I think that

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:35.780 
completely different and I think that
that<00:01:34.530> is<00:01:34.710> how<00:01:34.860> you<00:01:34.920> make<00:01:35.250> our<00:01:35.520> really

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:35.790 
that is how you make our really

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:37.490
