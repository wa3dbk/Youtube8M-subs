this that's all I have to do once I save

00:06:07.040 --> 00:06:08.260 
this that's all I have to do once I save
it<00:06:07.220> you<00:06:07.400> probably<00:06:07.670> noticed<00:06:07.970> that<00:06:08.120> it's

00:06:08.260 --> 00:06:08.270 
it you probably noticed that it's

00:06:08.270 --> 00:06:10.180 
it you probably noticed that it's
actually<00:06:08.600> saving<00:06:08.900> it<00:06:09.170> into<00:06:09.650> the<00:06:09.770> library

00:06:10.180 --> 00:06:10.190 
actually saving it into the library

00:06:10.190 --> 00:06:12.250 
actually saving it into the library
directly<00:06:10.640> I<00:06:10.910> don't<00:06:11.300> need<00:06:11.390> to<00:06:11.480> save<00:06:11.690> it<00:06:11.720> locally

00:06:12.250 --> 00:06:12.260 
directly I don't need to save it locally

00:06:12.260 --> 00:06:18.460 
directly I don't need to save it locally
anywhere<00:06:13.480> close<00:06:14.480> it<00:06:15.760> now<00:06:16.780> when<00:06:17.780> I<00:06:17.810> go<00:06:18.080> back<00:06:18.230> as

00:06:23.560 --> 00:06:23.570 
slide deck the presentation click on

00:06:23.570 --> 00:06:25.510 
slide deck the presentation click on
check<00:06:23.930> right<00:06:24.200> before<00:06:24.470> my<00:06:24.560> presentation<00:06:24.650> is

00:06:25.510 --> 00:06:25.520 
check right before my presentation is

00:06:25.520 --> 00:06:27.190 
check right before my presentation is
supposed<00:06:25.880> to<00:06:25.940> happen<00:06:26.120> I'll<00:06:26.390> do<00:06:26.540> a<00:06:26.570> check<00:06:26.960> here

00:06:27.190 --> 00:06:27.200 
supposed to happen I'll do a check here

00:06:27.200 --> 00:06:29.050 
supposed to happen I'll do a check here
and<00:06:27.350> then<00:06:27.950> I'll<00:06:28.070> see<00:06:28.250> that<00:06:28.280> sara<00:06:28.670> has<00:06:28.850> made

00:06:29.050 --> 00:06:29.060 
and then I'll see that sara has made

00:06:29.060 --> 00:06:31.720 
and then I'll see that sara has made
some<00:06:29.360> changes<00:06:29.750> to<00:06:29.990> other<00:06:30.260> slides<00:06:30.650> I'll<00:06:31.520> say

00:06:31.720 --> 00:06:31.730 
some changes to other slides I'll say

00:06:31.730 --> 00:06:33.640 
some changes to other slides I'll say
yes<00:06:31.970> I<00:06:32.120> do<00:06:32.390> want<00:06:32.510> those<00:06:32.840> changes<00:06:33.290> to<00:06:33.440> be

00:06:33.640 --> 00:06:33.650 
yes I do want those changes to be

00:06:33.650 --> 00:06:35.080 
yes I do want those changes to be
incorporated<00:06:34.160> into<00:06:34.250> my<00:06:34.460> slide<00:06:34.700> deck<00:06:34.730> I'll

00:06:35.080 --> 00:06:35.090 
incorporated into my slide deck I'll

00:06:35.090 --> 00:06:40.330 
incorporated into my slide deck I'll
click<00:06:35.240> on<00:06:35.360> yes<00:06:35.630> to<00:06:35.870> replace<00:06:37.360> and<00:06:38.860> there<00:06:39.860> you<00:06:39.980> go

00:06:40.330 --> 00:06:40.340 
click on yes to replace and there you go

00:06:40.340 --> 00:06:42.850 
click on yes to replace and there you go
so<00:06:41.030> the<00:06:41.420> new<00:06:41.540> changes<00:06:41.870> that<00:06:42.020> have<00:06:42.140> the<00:06:42.590> my<00:06:42.710> team

00:06:42.850 --> 00:06:42.860 
so the new changes that have the my team

00:06:42.860 --> 00:06:44.140 
so the new changes that have the my team
have<00:06:43.010> been<00:06:43.130> working<00:06:43.400> on<00:06:43.580> have<00:06:43.850> all<00:06:44.000> been

00:06:44.140 --> 00:06:44.150 
have been working on have all been

00:06:44.150 --> 00:06:46.270 
have been working on have all been
incorporated<00:06:44.660> at<00:06:44.750> this<00:06:44.900> time<00:06:45.110> into<00:06:45.950> the<00:06:46.040> slide

00:06:46.270 --> 00:06:46.280 
incorporated at this time into the slide

00:06:46.280 --> 00:06:49.810 
incorporated at this time into the slide
deck<00:06:46.490> I'll<00:06:46.670> go<00:06:46.790> ahead<00:06:46.910> and<00:06:47.030> save<00:06:47.180> it<00:06:47.330> now<00:06:48.820> so

00:06:49.810 --> 00:06:49.820 
deck I'll go ahead and save it now so

00:06:49.820 --> 00:06:52.030 
deck I'll go ahead and save it now so
this<00:06:50.000> is<00:06:50.120> how<00:06:50.240> you<00:06:50.300> can<00:06:50.510> use<00:06:50.540> a<00:06:50.840> slide<00:06:51.410> library

00:06:52.030 --> 00:06:52.040 
this is how you can use a slide library

00:06:52.040 --> 00:06:55.060 
this is how you can use a slide library
in<00:06:52.310> PowerPoint<00:06:53.240> 2007<00:06:53.630> together<00:06:54.320> to<00:06:54.830> your

00:06:58.460 --> 00:07:01.930 
benefit store the actual library store
the<00:06:58.900> deck<00:06:59.900> and<00:07:00.230> also<00:07:00.680> do<00:07:00.920> slides<00:07:01.310> from<00:07:01.760> the

00:07:01.930 --> 00:07:01.940 
the deck and also do slides from the

00:07:01.940 --> 00:07:03.910 
the deck and also do slides from the
library<00:07:02.390> from<00:07:02.990> the<00:07:03.110> presentation<00:07:03.620> directly

00:07:08.500 --> 00:07:08.510 
library go ahead and manage the

00:07:08.510 --> 00:07:10.810 
library go ahead and manage the
information<00:07:09.020> so<00:07:09.410> it's<00:07:09.560> all<00:07:09.710> searchable<00:07:10.160> it's

00:07:10.810 --> 00:07:10.820 
information so it's all searchable it's

00:07:10.820 --> 00:07:14.230 
information so it's all searchable it's
all<00:07:11.000> indexed<00:07:11.600> completely<00:07:12.200> it<00:07:13.130> is<00:07:13.460> manageable

00:07:17.410 --> 00:07:17.420 
before you can build on these things as

00:07:17.420 --> 00:07:19.540 
before you can build on these things as
well<00:07:17.570> you<00:07:17.810> can<00:07:17.960> subscribe<00:07:18.320> to<00:07:18.350> alerts<00:07:18.710> by

00:07:19.540 --> 00:07:19.550 
well you can subscribe to alerts by

00:07:19.550 --> 00:07:21.850 
well you can subscribe to alerts by
going<00:07:19.790> to<00:07:19.880> actions<00:07:20.270> and<00:07:20.480> alert<00:07:20.930> me<00:07:21.110> so<00:07:21.770> many

00:07:21.850 --> 00:07:21.860 
going to actions and alert me so many

00:07:21.860 --> 00:07:22.810 
going to actions and alert me so many
different<00:07:22.130> things<00:07:22.190> you<00:07:22.280> can<00:07:22.430> do<00:07:22.550> with<00:07:22.700> it

00:07:22.810 --> 00:07:22.820 
different things you can do with it

00:07:22.820 --> 00:07:24.550 
different things you can do with it
because<00:07:22.910> all<00:07:23.180> centered<00:07:23.810> in<00:07:23.930> SharePoint<00:07:24.410> and
