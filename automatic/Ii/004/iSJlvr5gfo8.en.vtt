sacrificing<00:01:07.500> an<00:01:07.619> attachment<00:01:08.369> like<00:01:08.729> a<00:01:08.760> oh<00:01:09.229> of

00:01:10.219 --> 00:01:10.229 
sacrificing an attachment like a oh of

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:12.850 
sacrificing an attachment like a oh of
course<00:01:10.260> ask<00:01:10.710> the<00:01:10.830> land<00:01:11.040> on<00:01:11.159> me<00:01:11.280> doesn't<00:01:11.580> it

00:01:15.859 --> 00:01:15.869 
you're also sacrificing a scope if you

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:17.480 
you're also sacrificing a scope if you
want<00:01:16.020> to<00:01:16.080> use<00:01:16.200> that<00:01:16.229> or<00:01:16.590> a<00:01:16.650> bayonet<00:01:17.310> which

00:01:32.720 --> 00:01:32.730 
and also are they really that different

00:01:32.730 --> 00:01:38.870 
and also are they really that different
from<00:01:34.430> the<00:01:35.430> Sayer<00:01:35.700> bazookas<00:01:36.630> or<00:01:37.880> primary

from the Sayer bazookas or primary
grenades<00:01:39.180> times<00:01:39.450> to<00:01:39.690> you<00:01:40.260> know<00:01:40.380> what's<00:01:40.890> the

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:41.070 
grenades times to you know what's the

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:44.720 
grenades times to you know what's the
real<00:01:41.280> difference<00:01:42.890> still<00:01:43.890> explosives<00:01:44.550> the

00:01:44.720 --> 00:01:44.730 
real difference still explosives the

00:01:44.730 --> 00:01:46.040 
real difference still explosives the
probably<00:01:45.030> still<00:01:45.210> is<00:01:45.360> powerful<00:01:45.810> just

00:01:46.040 --> 00:01:46.050 
probably still is powerful just

00:01:46.050 --> 00:01:51.080 
probably still is powerful just
different<00:01:46.740> types<00:01:46.920> of<00:01:47.040> explosives<00:01:49.280> and<00:01:50.280> you

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:51.090 
different types of explosives and you

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:53.810 
different types of explosives and you
know<00:01:51.180> rifle<00:01:51.540> grenades<00:01:51.810> do<00:01:52.430> jack-shit<00:01:53.430> the

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:53.820 
know rifle grenades do jack-shit the

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:55.910 
know rifle grenades do jack-shit the
tanks<00:01:54.270> so<00:01:54.480> they're<00:01:55.230> only<00:01:55.350> useful<00:01:55.560> against

00:01:55.910 --> 00:01:55.920 
tanks so they're only useful against

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:59.060 
tanks so they're only useful against
players<00:01:57.230> all<00:01:58.230> right<00:01:58.350> so<00:01:58.440> i<00:01:58.500> put<00:01:58.680> my<00:01:58.800> artillery

forties<00:02:30.740> I<00:02:34.250> lost<00:02:35.250> my<00:02:35.390> lost<00:02:36.390> my<00:02:36.930> train<00:02:37.110> of

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:37.170 
forties I lost my lost my train of

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:43.460 
forties I lost my lost my train of
thought<00:02:37.230> there<00:02:38.030> um<00:02:39.030> oh<00:02:40.940> yeah<00:02:42.020> with<00:02:43.020> all<00:02:43.320> the

00:02:43.460 --> 00:02:43.470 
thought there um oh yeah with all the

00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:47.420 
thought there um oh yeah with all the
bolt<00:02:43.650> actions<00:02:44.100> except<00:02:44.459> the<00:02:44.520> ptrs<00:02:46.430> they

00:02:47.420 --> 00:02:47.430 
bolt actions except the ptrs they

00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:49.280 
bolt actions except the ptrs they
actually<00:02:47.730> have<00:02:47.880> like<00:02:48.180> the<00:02:48.360> same<00:02:48.390> damage<00:02:48.900> each

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:49.290 
actually have like the same damage each

00:02:49.290 --> 00:02:54.110 
actually have like the same damage each
so<00:02:49.709> I<00:02:50.720> figured<00:02:51.720> the<00:02:51.810> best<00:02:52.290> way<00:02:52.410> to<00:02:52.850> to<00:02:53.850> choose

00:02:54.110 --> 00:02:54.120 
so I figured the best way to to choose

00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:57.650 
so I figured the best way to to choose
which<00:02:54.330> one<00:02:54.540> to<00:02:54.570> use<00:02:54.690> is<00:02:55.790> which<00:02:56.790> iron<00:02:57.180> sights<00:02:57.450> do

00:02:57.650 --> 00:02:57.660 
which one to use is which iron sights do

00:02:57.660 --> 00:03:03.650 
which one to use is which iron sights do

sights<00:03:06.720> I<00:03:07.050> tend<00:03:07.590> to<00:03:07.650> find<00:03:07.830> that<00:03:07.950> the<00:03:08.520> car<00:03:08.790> is

00:03:08.960 --> 00:03:08.970 
sights I tend to find that the car is

00:03:08.970 --> 00:03:11.479 
sights I tend to find that the car is
the<00:03:09.120> best<00:03:09.360> I<00:03:09.739> don't<00:03:10.739> know<00:03:10.800> why<00:03:10.950> that<00:03:10.980> it<00:03:11.280> just

00:03:11.479 --> 00:03:11.489 
the best I don't know why that it just

00:03:11.489 --> 00:03:13.130 
the best I don't know why that it just
seems<00:03:11.670> the<00:03:11.820> most<00:03:11.940> accurate<00:03:12.450> and<00:03:12.510> most<00:03:12.570> easy<00:03:12.900> to

00:03:13.130 --> 00:03:13.140 
seems the most accurate and most easy to

00:03:13.140 --> 00:03:22.090 
seems the most accurate and most easy to
use<00:03:13.260> I<00:03:15.920> kind<00:03:16.920> of<00:03:17.010> like<00:03:17.160> the<00:03:17.280> eris<00:03:17.489> a<00:03:17.700> case

00:03:22.090 --> 00:03:22.100 

00:03:22.100 --> 00:03:24.010 

but<00:03:22.670> no<00:03:22.820> these<00:03:23.030> seem<00:03:23.270> to<00:03:23.300> what<00:03:23.510> the<00:03:23.630> best<00:03:23.780> move

00:03:24.010 --> 00:03:24.020 
but no these seem to what the best move

00:03:24.020 --> 00:03:26.050 
but no these seem to what the best move
some<00:03:24.260> reason<00:03:24.530> the<00:03:24.620> cars<00:03:24.890> and<00:03:25.220> I<00:03:25.460> I<00:03:25.700> don't<00:03:26.000> know

00:03:26.050 --> 00:03:26.060 
some reason the cars and I I don't know

00:03:26.060 --> 00:03:28.600 
some reason the cars and I I don't know
why<00:03:26.240> because<00:03:26.450> I<00:03:26.570> hardly<00:03:27.530> ever<00:03:27.620> use<00:03:27.920> the<00:03:28.100> car<00:03:28.310> so

00:03:28.600 --> 00:03:28.610 
why because I hardly ever use the car so

00:03:28.610 --> 00:03:30.460 
why because I hardly ever use the car so
you<00:03:28.640> think<00:03:29.300> I'd<00:03:29.450> have<00:03:29.630> not<00:03:29.930> much<00:03:30.050> practice

00:03:30.460 --> 00:03:30.470 
you think I'd have not much practice

00:03:30.470 --> 00:03:33.940 
you think I'd have not much practice
with<00:03:30.590> it<00:03:31.840> but<00:03:32.840> this<00:03:32.900> was<00:03:33.080> pretty<00:03:33.290> good<00:03:33.440> I<00:03:33.680> mean

00:03:33.940 --> 00:03:33.950 
with it but this was pretty good I mean

00:03:33.950 --> 00:03:37.060 
with it but this was pretty good I mean
I<00:03:34.130> guess<00:03:34.310> I'm<00:03:34.430> pretty<00:03:35.230> some<00:03:36.230> decent<00:03:36.590> sniping

00:03:37.060 --> 00:03:37.070 
I guess I'm pretty some decent sniping

00:03:37.070 --> 00:03:44.140 
I guess I'm pretty some decent sniping
