own<00:00:30.880> and<00:00:31.230> I<00:00:32.230> didn't<00:00:32.650> play<00:00:32.770> it<00:00:32.860> that<00:00:32.950> much<00:00:33.010> back

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:33.430 
own and I didn't play it that much back

00:00:33.430 --> 00:00:34.770 
own and I didn't play it that much back
in<00:00:33.610> the<00:00:33.730> day<00:00:33.880> when<00:00:34.000> I<00:00:34.060> first<00:00:34.270> got<00:00:34.480> it<00:00:34.660> I<00:00:34.720> think

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:34.780 
in the day when I first got it I think

00:00:34.780 --> 00:00:36.390 
in the day when I first got it I think
it<00:00:34.960> came<00:00:35.050> out<00:00:35.200> around<00:00:35.650> two<00:00:35.950> thousand<00:00:36.310> eleven

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:36.400 
it came out around two thousand eleven

00:00:36.400 --> 00:00:38.880 
it came out around two thousand eleven
of<00:00:37.000> November<00:00:37.600> yeah<00:00:37.810> that's<00:00:38.230> when<00:00:38.440> black<00:00:38.680> ops<00:00:38.710> 1

00:00:38.880 --> 00:00:38.890 
of November yeah that's when black ops 1

00:00:38.890 --> 00:00:41.160 
of November yeah that's when black ops 1
first<00:00:39.160> came<00:00:39.370> out<00:00:39.520> when<00:00:40.090> I<00:00:40.120> got<00:00:40.420> it<00:00:40.600> it<00:00:40.780> didn't

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:41.170 
first came out when I got it it didn't

00:00:41.170 --> 00:00:42.420 
first came out when I got it it didn't
run<00:00:41.260> very<00:00:41.470> well<00:00:41.500> on<00:00:41.740> the<00:00:41.830> computer<00:00:42.250> because

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:42.430 
run very well on the computer because

00:00:42.430 --> 00:00:44.490 
run very well on the computer because
for<00:00:43.120> two<00:00:43.210> reasons<00:00:43.420> number<00:00:43.810> one<00:00:43.930> my<00:00:44.200> computer

00:00:44.490 --> 00:00:44.500 
for two reasons number one my computer

00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:45.630 
for two reasons number one my computer
wasn't<00:00:44.650> strong<00:00:44.860> enough<00:00:44.920> it<00:00:45.340> was<00:00:45.460> only<00:00:45.550> a

00:00:45.630 --> 00:00:45.640 
wasn't strong enough it was only a

00:00:45.640 --> 00:00:48.000 
wasn't strong enough it was only a
dual-core<00:00:46.150> CPU<00:00:46.540> at<00:00:46.630> the<00:00:46.690> time<00:00:46.900> so<00:00:47.140> I<00:00:47.380> only<00:00:47.860> got

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:48.010 
dual-core CPU at the time so I only got

00:00:48.010 --> 00:00:51.120 
dual-core CPU at the time so I only got
like<00:00:48.130> 10<00:00:48.310> to<00:00:48.400> 20<00:00:48.610> 55<00:00:49.090> FPS<00:00:49.330> on<00:00:49.750> it<00:00:49.870> and<00:00:50.020> I<00:00:50.800> blamed

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:51.130 
like 10 to 20 55 FPS on it and I blamed

00:00:51.130 --> 00:00:53.610 
like 10 to 20 55 FPS on it and I blamed
it<00:00:51.250> on<00:00:51.370> the<00:00:51.550> game<00:00:51.760> Herbie<00:00:52.630> unoptimized<00:00:52.960> but<00:00:53.440> I

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:53.620 
it on the game Herbie unoptimized but I

00:00:53.620 --> 00:00:55.830 
it on the game Herbie unoptimized but I
was<00:00:54.010> only<00:00:54.220> half<00:00:54.370> right<00:00:54.610> the<00:00:55.180> other<00:00:55.300> reason<00:00:55.720> was

00:00:55.830 --> 00:00:55.840 
was only half right the other reason was

00:00:55.840 --> 00:00:57.450 
was only half right the other reason was
because<00:00:56.050> my<00:00:56.440> CP<00:00:56.710> wasn't<00:00:56.950> strong<00:00:57.070> enough<00:00:57.130> but

00:00:57.450 --> 00:00:57.460 
because my CP wasn't strong enough but

00:00:57.460 --> 00:00:59.760 
because my CP wasn't strong enough but
yeah<00:00:57.940> it<00:00:58.150> was<00:00:58.300> very<00:00:58.390> unoptimized<00:00:58.780> and<00:00:59.320> even

00:00:59.760 --> 00:00:59.770 
yeah it was very unoptimized and even

00:00:59.770 --> 00:01:02.130 
yeah it was very unoptimized and even
when<00:00:59.860> I<00:00:59.920> had<00:01:00.040> a<00:01:00.100> quad<00:01:00.430> core<00:01:00.670> I<00:01:00.940> was<00:01:01.720> still<00:01:01.960> only

00:01:02.130 --> 00:01:02.140 
when I had a quad core I was still only

00:01:02.140 --> 00:01:04.829 
when I had a quad core I was still only
getting<00:01:02.650> very<00:01:03.100> mediocre<00:01:03.460> frames<00:01:04.000> like<00:01:04.269> in<00:01:04.539> the

00:01:04.829 --> 00:01:04.839 
getting very mediocre frames like in the

00:01:04.839 --> 00:01:08.039 
getting very mediocre frames like in the
ballpark<00:01:05.320> of<00:01:05.469> 45<00:01:06.130> to<00:01:06.369> 50<00:01:06.850> it<00:01:07.030> just<00:01:07.240> wasn't<00:01:07.869> good

00:01:08.039 --> 00:01:08.049 
ballpark of 45 to 50 it just wasn't good

00:01:08.049 --> 00:01:10.800 
ballpark of 45 to 50 it just wasn't good
I<00:01:08.289> fully<00:01:09.159> expected<00:01:09.640> something<00:01:09.880> around<00:01:10.329> 82

00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:10.810 
I fully expected something around 82

00:01:10.810 --> 00:01:13.649 
I fully expected something around 82
over<00:01:11.530> 120<00:01:12.399> you<00:01:12.789> know<00:01:12.880> kind<00:01:13.359> of<00:01:13.390> like<00:01:13.450> what<00:01:13.630> I

00:01:13.649 --> 00:01:13.659 
over 120 you know kind of like what I

00:01:13.659 --> 00:01:16.109 
over 120 you know kind of like what I
would<00:01:14.109> get<00:01:14.320> in<00:01:14.530> modern<00:01:14.859> warfare<00:01:15.009> 3<00:01:15.189> and<00:01:15.670> black

00:01:16.109 --> 00:01:16.119 
would get in modern warfare 3 and black

00:01:16.119 --> 00:01:20.069 
would get in modern warfare 3 and black
ops<00:01:16.359> 2<00:01:16.600> and<00:01:16.899> also<00:01:17.740> cod4<00:01:18.310> so<00:01:19.299> you<00:01:19.840> can<00:01:19.990> imagine

00:01:20.069 --> 00:01:20.079 
ops 2 and also cod4 so you can imagine

00:01:20.079 --> 00:01:22.440 
ops 2 and also cod4 so you can imagine
my<00:01:20.350> disappointment<00:01:20.590> like<00:01:21.219> I<00:01:21.429> guess<00:01:22.179> the<00:01:22.420> main

00:01:22.440 --> 00:01:22.450 
my disappointment like I guess the main

00:01:22.450 --> 00:01:24.239 
my disappointment like I guess the main
reason<00:01:22.630> why<00:01:23.079> black<00:01:23.499> ops<00:01:23.710> 1<00:01:23.770> was<00:01:24.009> so

00:01:24.239 --> 00:01:24.249 
reason why black ops 1 was so

00:01:24.249 --> 00:01:26.880 
reason why black ops 1 was so
unoptimized<00:01:24.609> on<00:01:25.210> PC<00:01:25.749> was<00:01:25.990> because<00:01:26.320> treyarch

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:26.890 
unoptimized on PC was because treyarch

00:01:26.890 --> 00:01:28.919 
unoptimized on PC was because treyarch
it<00:01:27.729> was<00:01:27.850> the<00:01:27.969> first<00:01:28.179> time<00:01:28.329> that<00:01:28.390> treyarch<00:01:28.840> I

00:01:28.919 --> 00:01:28.929 
it was the first time that treyarch I

00:01:28.929 --> 00:01:30.630 
it was the first time that treyarch I
decided<00:01:29.259> to<00:01:29.409> take<00:01:29.590> on<00:01:29.829> a<00:01:29.859> call<00:01:30.130> duty<00:01:30.369> game

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:30.640 
decided to take on a call duty game

00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:33.989 
decided to take on a call duty game
right<00:01:31.240> after<00:01:31.420> modern<00:01:32.319> warfare<00:01:32.530> 2<00:01:33.219> was<00:01:33.729> having

00:01:33.989 --> 00:01:33.999 
right after modern warfare 2 was having

00:01:33.999 --> 00:01:36.029 
right after modern warfare 2 was having
its<00:01:34.119> Fiasco<00:01:34.630> with<00:01:34.840> the<00:01:34.899> Infinity<00:01:35.409> Ward<00:01:35.649> people

00:01:36.029 --> 00:01:36.039 
its Fiasco with the Infinity Ward people

00:01:36.039 --> 00:01:39.029 
its Fiasco with the Infinity Ward people
being<00:01:36.249> kicked<00:01:36.460> out<00:01:36.640> and<00:01:37.319> they<00:01:38.319> just<00:01:38.499> weren't

00:01:39.029 --> 00:01:39.039 
being kicked out and they just weren't

00:01:39.039 --> 00:01:41.099 
being kicked out and they just weren't
familiar<00:01:39.219> with<00:01:39.520> the<00:01:39.909> infrastructure<00:01:40.569> of<00:01:40.749> the

00:01:41.099 --> 00:01:41.109 
familiar with the infrastructure of the

00:01:41.109 --> 00:01:43.620 
familiar with the infrastructure of the
cot<00:01:41.289> engines<00:01:41.679> so<00:01:42.179> that's<00:01:43.179> probably<00:01:43.389> it

00:01:43.620 --> 00:01:43.630 
cot engines so that's probably it

00:01:43.630 --> 00:01:45.510 
cot engines so that's probably it
luckily<00:01:44.530> I<00:01:44.619> don't<00:01:44.770> think<00:01:45.039> we<00:01:45.159> have<00:01:45.310> to<00:01:45.490> worry

00:01:45.510 --> 00:01:45.520 
luckily I don't think we have to worry

they<00:01:56.570> decided<00:01:56.869> to<00:01:57.020> remove<00:01:57.229> theater<00:01:57.619> mode

00:01:57.730 --> 00:01:57.740 
they decided to remove theater mode

00:01:57.740 --> 00:01:59.380 
they decided to remove theater mode
which<00:01:58.009> in<00:01:58.189> my<00:01:58.280> opinion<00:01:58.340> was<00:01:58.700> a<00:01:58.729> very<00:01:59.030> good<00:01:59.180> move

00:01:59.380 --> 00:01:59.390 
which in my opinion was a very good move

00:01:59.390 --> 00:02:00.999 
which in my opinion was a very good move
because<00:01:59.600> even<00:02:00.079> though<00:02:00.229> it<00:02:00.469> was<00:02:00.590> really<00:02:00.829> good

00:02:00.999 --> 00:02:01.009 
because even though it was really good

00:02:01.009 --> 00:02:02.889 
because even though it was really good
for<00:02:01.310> people<00:02:01.610> who<00:02:01.820> wanted<00:02:02.000> to<00:02:02.180> make<00:02:02.360> their

00:02:18.009 --> 00:02:18.019 
like they tried to improve it every year

00:02:18.019 --> 00:02:20.710 
like they tried to improve it every year
but<00:02:18.769> it<00:02:18.860> can<00:02:18.980> only<00:02:19.040> do<00:02:19.280> so<00:02:19.310> much<00:02:19.730> and<00:02:20.030> when<00:02:20.660> you

00:02:20.710 --> 00:02:20.720 
but it can only do so much and when you

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:22.300 
but it can only do so much and when you
have<00:02:20.750> the<00:02:20.900> theater<00:02:21.050> mode<00:02:21.349> up<00:02:21.500> all<00:02:21.680> it<00:02:21.800> does<00:02:22.040> is

00:02:22.300 --> 00:02:22.310 
have the theater mode up all it does is

00:02:22.310 --> 00:02:24.479 
have the theater mode up all it does is
not<00:02:23.060> only<00:02:23.180> doesn't<00:02:23.360> have<00:02:23.510> to<00:02:23.569> calculate<00:02:23.810> the

00:02:24.479 --> 00:02:24.489 
not only doesn't have to calculate the

not only doesn't have to calculate the

the bullet trajectories and everything
all<00:02:29.090> the<00:02:29.420> data<00:02:29.660> going<00:02:30.110> on<00:02:30.230> in<00:02:30.319> the<00:02:30.410> game<00:02:30.500> it

00:02:30.610 --> 00:02:30.620 
all the data going on in the game it

00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:33.070 
all the data going on in the game it
also<00:02:30.860> has<00:02:30.950> to<00:02:31.069> record<00:02:31.519> everything<00:02:31.880> within<00:02:32.750> its

00:02:33.070 --> 00:02:33.080 
also has to record everything within its

00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:36.520 
also has to record everything within its
unique<00:02:33.890> system<00:02:34.250> and<00:02:34.670> I<00:02:35.599> think<00:02:36.110> this<00:02:36.230> is<00:02:36.290> what

00:02:36.520 --> 00:02:36.530 
unique system and I think this is what

00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:38.620 
unique system and I think this is what
caused<00:02:36.739> a<00:02:36.950> lag<00:02:37.130> in<00:02:37.160> the<00:02:37.340> first<00:02:37.610> place<00:02:37.790> that<00:02:38.390> and

00:02:38.620 --> 00:02:38.630 
caused a lag in the first place that and

00:02:38.630 --> 00:02:40.720 
caused a lag in the first place that and
also<00:02:38.780> taking<00:02:39.260> into<00:02:39.319> account<00:02:39.500> that<00:02:40.099> the<00:02:40.160> xbox

what I mean guys battlefield is the type
of<00:04:44.270> game<00:04:44.539> that<00:04:44.840> instills<00:04:45.770> creativity<00:04:46.460> and

00:04:46.570 --> 00:04:46.580 
of game that instills creativity and

00:04:46.580 --> 00:04:48.850 
of game that instills creativity and
people<00:04:46.970> it<00:04:47.210> really<00:04:47.810> stimulates<00:04:48.410> the<00:04:48.530> creative

00:04:48.850 --> 00:04:48.860 
people it really stimulates the creative

00:04:48.860 --> 00:04:50.860 
people it really stimulates the creative
side<00:04:49.010> of<00:04:49.160> me<00:04:49.310> it<00:04:49.490> makes<00:04:49.639> me<00:04:49.760> think<00:04:50.030> of<00:04:50.180> unique

00:04:50.860 --> 00:04:50.870 
side of me it makes me think of unique

00:04:50.870 --> 00:04:53.890 
side of me it makes me think of unique
ways<00:04:51.139> to<00:04:51.560> dispose<00:04:52.370> of<00:04:52.430> opponents<00:04:53.120> and<00:04:53.300> I<00:04:53.720> guess

00:04:53.890 --> 00:04:53.900 
ways to dispose of opponents and I guess

00:04:53.900 --> 00:04:55.150 
ways to dispose of opponents and I guess
that's<00:04:54.110> the<00:04:54.139> exact<00:04:54.440> same<00:04:54.590> reason<00:04:54.889> why<00:04:54.979> I<00:04:55.010> want

00:04:55.150 --> 00:04:55.160 
that's the exact same reason why I want

that's the exact same reason why I want
to<00:04:55.220> get<00:04:55.340> caught<00:04:55.550> goes<00:04:55.789> to<00:04:56.030> because<00:04:56.330> now<00:04:56.479> that

00:04:56.500 --> 00:04:56.510 
to get caught goes to because now that

00:04:56.510 --> 00:04:58.210 
to get caught goes to because now that
they<00:04:56.720> have<00:04:56.750> their<00:04:56.870> own<00:04:57.139> little<00:04:57.289> type<00:04:58.099> of

they have their own little type of
destruction<00:04:58.760> in<00:04:58.880> the<00:04:58.970> game<00:04:59.120> too<00:04:59.360> it's<00:04:59.690> not

00:04:59.770 --> 00:04:59.780
