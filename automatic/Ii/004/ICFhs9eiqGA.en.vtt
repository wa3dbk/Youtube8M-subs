00:05:25.430 --> 00:05:25.440 
problem so like I said I'm gonna take

00:05:25.440 --> 00:05:26.870 
problem so like I said I'm gonna take
these<00:05:25.590> back<00:05:25.860> out<00:05:26.130> and<00:05:26.370> touch<00:05:26.520> up<00:05:26.730> the<00:05:26.850> paint

these back out and touch up the paint
but<00:05:27.650> that's<00:05:28.650> how<00:05:28.830> you<00:05:28.890> replaced<00:05:29.400> it<00:05:29.580> a<00:05:29.640> little

00:05:29.780 --> 00:05:29.790 
but that's how you replaced it a little

00:05:29.790 --> 00:05:31.730 
but that's how you replaced it a little
grommets<00:05:30.300> that<00:05:30.450> hold<00:05:30.660> on<00:05:30.840> your<00:05:31.020> side<00:05:31.230> covers

00:05:31.730 --> 00:05:31.740 
grommets that hold on your side covers

00:05:31.740 --> 00:05:34.100 
grommets that hold on your side covers
and<00:05:31.950> there<00:05:32.160> is<00:05:32.310> one<00:05:32.580> on<00:05:32.880> this<00:05:33.060> bike<00:05:33.330> get<00:05:33.690> up<00:05:33.960> in

00:05:34.100 --> 00:05:34.110 
and there is one on this bike get up in

00:05:34.110 --> 00:05:40.800 
and there is one on this bike get up in
the<00:05:34.230> headlight<00:05:34.590> bucket

00:05:42.330 --> 00:05:42.340 
it's the difference between you side

00:05:42.340 --> 00:05:44.550 
it's the difference between you side
covers<00:05:42.760> staying<00:05:43.060> on<00:05:43.360> or<00:05:43.390> being<00:05:43.840> easy<00:05:44.080> to<00:05:44.350> take

00:05:44.550 --> 00:05:44.560
