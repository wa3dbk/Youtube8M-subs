00:00:15.560 --> 00:00:20.640
 grandma without but after dad none 

00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:22.710
 I sow in my mother's belly 

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:25.079
 what happens well my dear you have to 

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:27.329
 to know that at that precise moment he has 

00:00:25.079 --> 00:00:30.269
 start a great adventure and venture 

00:00:27.329 --> 00:00:32.009
 tells how I told you in the 

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:34.740
 sperm what you call guys 

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:37.110
 even the seeds swim very many 

00:00:34.740 --> 00:00:40.770
 tiny gerini known by the name of 

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:42.470
 spermatozoa are about 180 million on 

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:47.220
 starting line 

00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:49.590
 ejaculation starts the race with 

00:00:47.220 --> 00:00:51.780
 their long tail shaking strongly 

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:55.020
 the spermatozoa must go back up into the 

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:55.530
 body of the future mother through the 

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:59.040
 vagina 

00:00:55.530 --> 00:01:03.680
 then in the luther then in the tubes up to the 

00:00:59.040 --> 00:01:03.680
 region of the ovaries to the right or left 

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:07.979
 if there is nothing inside the tube 

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:10.710
 this whole race will be of no use e 

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:12.450
 spermatozoa will be eliminated 

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:14.820
 but if that is the moment when the grandmother 

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:17.460
 and fruitful if the nodule the product from 

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:19.319
 ovary then the final prize of the 

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:23.759
 race is special 

00:01:19.319 --> 00:01:26.700
 you can develop a child but first 

00:01:23.759 --> 00:01:28.439
 each spermatozoon will have to swim to change 

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:32.609
 swim with all your strength to get there 

00:01:28.439 --> 00:01:34.319
 first conquer the egg and if you do a 

00:01:32.609 --> 00:01:36.719
 comparison with human beings 

00:01:34.319 --> 00:01:38.670
 i can tell you my dear boys that one 

00:01:36.719 --> 00:01:40.229
 spermatozoon swims twice more 

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:44.009
 hurry of the swimming world champion 

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:45.899
 of all categories and travels 

00:01:44.009 --> 00:01:50.119
 the equivalent of six kilometers per 

00:01:45.899 --> 00:01:53.389
 reach the goal here they arrive 

00:01:50.119 --> 00:01:56.700
 some tired stop too soon 

00:01:53.389 --> 00:01:59.719
 others lose or go up the tube 

00:01:56.700 --> 00:02:02.549
 wrong after this long marathon 

00:01:59.719 --> 00:02:02.990
 only a few hundred comes close 

00:02:02.549 --> 00:02:07.270
 Mr 

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:07.270
 in a small welcoming environment 

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:13.430
 at that point the egg starts to turn 

00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:15.739
 on himself very slowly and 

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:20.209
 sperm happy to have reached the 

00:02:15.739 --> 00:02:22.810
 gather around to dance is 

00:02:20.209 --> 00:02:22.810
 a party 

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:29.630
 then all together and put a substance 

00:02:28.099 --> 00:02:34.000
 detail that melts the shell 

00:02:29.630 --> 00:02:34.000
 of the egg in order to open a passage 

00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:39.920
 it's a wonderful group work 

00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:42.980
 spermatozoa have a strong sense of 

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:45.019
 solidarity and when finally one of 

00:02:42.980 --> 00:02:46.930
 they manage to enter the rest of the 

00:02:45.019 --> 00:02:49.730
 group is happy for him 

00:02:46.930 --> 00:02:51.650
 meanwhile inside the egg the nucleus 

00:02:49.730 --> 00:02:53.150
 awaits the arrival of the spermatozoon which 

00:02:51.650 --> 00:02:56.060
 he left his tail in the wardrobe 

00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:58.160
 like a scarf the egg and it 

00:02:56.060 --> 00:03:00.680
 spermatozoon approach and merge 

00:02:58.160 --> 00:03:02.569
 into one another to form an egg e 

00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:05.000
 this egg is different from all the others 

00:03:02.569 --> 00:03:08.480
 that will split and grow in the belly 

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:11.900
 of the mother to give birth to a 

00:03:08.480 --> 00:03:14.950
 baby or girl but fat group 

00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:17.420
 with white yellow or black skin 

00:03:14.950 --> 00:03:18.900
 as he has inherited from his own 

00:03:17.420 --> 00:03:21.120

00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:24.540

00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:26.250

 who knows how but that brings us into the world 

00:03:40.700 --> 00:03:47.210
 what factory will be and then how to do it 

00:03:43.850 --> 00:03:50.030

00:03:50.030 --> 00:03:59.510
