00:02:43.590 --> 00:02:43.600 
microwave well this is - Lila it's a

00:02:43.600 --> 00:02:51.070 
microwave well this is - Lila it's a
micro<00:02:43.930> fridge<00:02:44.220> it<00:02:45.220> sucks

00:02:51.070 --> 00:02:51.080 

00:02:51.080 --> 00:03:05.100 

so<00:02:51.740> far<00:02:51.980> no<00:02:52.270> explosions<00:02:53.410> person<00:02:54.410> to<00:02:54.500> plan

00:03:05.100 --> 00:03:05.110 

00:03:05.110 --> 00:03:07.200 

seems<00:03:05.680> to<00:03:05.740> be<00:03:05.830> cooking<00:03:06.640> quite<00:03:06.970> nicely

00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:07.210 
seems to be cooking quite nicely

00:03:07.210 --> 00:03:15.990 
seems to be cooking quite nicely
actually

00:03:15.990 --> 00:03:16.000 

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:21.559 

wow<00:03:16.890> this<00:03:17.890> is<00:03:18.070> pretty<00:03:18.220> lame

00:03:21.559 --> 00:03:21.569 

00:03:21.569 --> 00:03:24.679 

so<00:03:22.170> far<00:03:22.409> the<00:03:22.530> only<00:03:22.560> action<00:03:23.069> is<00:03:23.220> paper<00:03:23.909> folding

00:03:24.679 --> 00:03:24.689 
so far the only action is paper folding

00:03:24.689 --> 00:03:28.850 
so far the only action is paper folding
up<00:03:24.780> on<00:03:24.900> the<00:03:24.989> sides<00:03:25.200> of<00:03:25.319> the<00:03:25.409> microwave<00:03:27.739> so<00:03:28.739> I'm

00:03:28.850 --> 00:03:28.860 
up on the sides of the microwave so I'm

00:03:28.860 --> 00:03:30.740 
up on the sides of the microwave so I'm
just<00:03:29.010> gonna<00:03:29.099> end<00:03:29.189> this<00:03:29.430> early<00:03:29.790> and<00:03:30.030> just<00:03:30.569> say

00:03:30.740 --> 00:03:30.750 
just gonna end this early and just say

00:03:30.750 --> 00:03:33.559 
just gonna end this early and just say
that<00:03:30.989> it's<00:03:31.739> a<00:03:31.860> good<00:03:32.430> idea<00:03:32.640> I<00:03:32.939> mean<00:03:33.239> you<00:03:33.480> don't

00:03:33.559 --> 00:03:33.569

00:03:33.569 --> 00:03:34.880 
that it's a good idea I mean you don't
have<00:03:33.720> a<00:03:33.810> paper<00:03:33.989> towel<00:03:34.230> you<00:03:34.409> got<00:03:34.560> some<00:03:34.680> friend

00:03:39.710 --> 00:03:39.720 
just don't go sitting around watching it

00:03:39.720 --> 00:03:41.750 
just don't go sitting around watching it
because<00:03:39.959> it's<00:03:40.079> cleaned<00:03:40.680> up<00:03:40.890> okay

00:03:41.750 --> 00:03:41.760
