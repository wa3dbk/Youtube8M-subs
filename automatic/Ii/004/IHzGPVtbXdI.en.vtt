00:06:28.909 --> 00:06:28.919 
any of the other claws if they have

backup<00:06:29.819> and<00:06:29.939> redo<00:06:30.269> them<00:06:31.550> then<00:06:32.550> even<00:06:33.269> out<00:06:33.449> your

00:06:34.339 --> 00:06:34.349 
backup and redo them then even out your

00:06:34.349 --> 00:06:37.790 
backup and redo them then even out your
excess<00:06:35.569> so<00:06:36.569> that<00:06:36.599> the<00:06:36.869> rubber<00:06:37.080> and<00:06:37.289> rails<00:06:37.529> are

00:06:37.790 --> 00:06:37.800 
excess so that the rubber and rails are

00:06:37.800 --> 00:06:42.559 
excess so that the rubber and rails are
evenly<00:06:38.219> distributed<00:06:38.929> along<00:06:39.929> the<00:06:39.989> blade<00:06:41.569> then

00:06:42.559 --> 00:06:42.569 
evenly distributed along the blade then

00:06:42.569 --> 00:06:47.809 
evenly distributed along the blade then
you<00:06:42.779> just<00:06:43.339> reinstall<00:06:44.339> the<00:06:44.489> wiper<00:06:44.699> arm<00:06:46.819> and

00:06:47.809 --> 00:06:47.819 
you just reinstall the wiper arm and

00:06:47.819 --> 00:06:50.139 
you just reinstall the wiper arm and
you're<00:06:47.939> done

00:06:50.139 --> 00:06:50.149 
you're done

00:06:50.149 --> 00:06:53.059 
you're done
if<00:06:51.149> you<00:06:51.659> do<00:06:51.809> need<00:06:52.019> to<00:06:52.139> use<00:06:52.169> the<00:06:52.349> metal<00:06:52.860> rails

00:06:53.059 --> 00:06:53.069 
if you do need to use the metal rails

00:06:53.069 --> 00:06:55.879 
if you do need to use the metal rails
that<00:06:53.369> come<00:06:53.579> with<00:06:53.789> the<00:06:53.909> refill<00:06:54.529> cut<00:06:55.529> the<00:06:55.649> rails

00:06:55.879 --> 00:06:55.889 
that come with the refill cut the rails

00:06:55.889 --> 00:06:58.429 
that come with the refill cut the rails
to<00:06:56.309> a<00:06:56.339> length<00:06:56.639> so<00:06:57.419> they<00:06:57.569> can't<00:06:57.809> work<00:06:58.019> free<00:06:58.319> on

00:06:58.429 --> 00:06:58.439 
to a length so they can't work free on

00:06:58.439 --> 00:07:01.069 
to a length so they can't work free on
their<00:06:58.559> own<00:06:58.939> but<00:06:59.939> they're<00:07:00.089> easy<00:07:00.360> to<00:07:00.569> get<00:07:00.719> free

00:07:01.069 --> 00:07:01.079 
their own but they're easy to get free

00:07:01.079 --> 00:07:05.179 
their own but they're easy to get free
when<00:07:01.709> you<00:07:01.889> bow<00:07:02.579> the<00:07:02.789> center<00:07:03.089> out<00:07:03.269> if<00:07:03.949> you<00:07:04.949> pull

00:07:05.179 --> 00:07:05.189 
when you bow the center out if you pull

00:07:05.189 --> 00:07:08.269 
when you bow the center out if you pull
all<00:07:05.429> the<00:07:05.610> slack<00:07:05.729> to<00:07:06.089> one<00:07:06.269> end<00:07:06.919> cut<00:07:07.919> the<00:07:08.039> rails

00:07:08.269 --> 00:07:08.279 
all the slack to one end cut the rails

00:07:08.279 --> 00:07:11.299 
all the slack to one end cut the rails
so<00:07:08.579> they<00:07:08.729> stick<00:07:08.999> beyond<00:07:09.329> the<00:07:09.509> last<00:07:09.749> claw<00:07:10.309> about

00:07:11.299 --> 00:07:11.309 
so they stick beyond the last claw about

00:07:11.309 --> 00:07:15.979 
so they stick beyond the last claw about
an<00:07:11.519> eighth<00:07:11.759> of<00:07:12.089> an<00:07:12.209> inch<00:07:14.389> they<00:07:15.389> usually<00:07:15.749> break

00:07:15.979 --> 00:07:15.989 
an eighth of an inch they usually break

00:07:15.989 --> 00:07:18.649 
an eighth of an inch they usually break
pretty<00:07:16.289> easy<00:07:16.529> if<00:07:17.009> you<00:07:17.909> use<00:07:17.939> a<00:07:18.089> pair<00:07:18.419> of<00:07:18.449> pliers

00:07:18.649 --> 00:07:18.659 
pretty easy if you use a pair of pliers

00:07:18.659 --> 00:07:21.259 
pretty easy if you use a pair of pliers
and<00:07:19.079> just<00:07:19.860> bend<00:07:20.009> them<00:07:20.309> slightly<00:07:20.639> back<00:07:21.059> and

00:07:21.259 --> 00:07:21.269 
and just bend them slightly back and

00:07:21.269 --> 00:07:31.800 
and just bend them slightly back and
forth<00:07:21.509> a<00:07:21.779> few<00:07:22.379> times

00:07:31.800 --> 00:07:31.810 

00:07:31.810 --> 00:07:36.930 

they'll<00:07:32.320> break<00:07:32.530> pretty<00:07:32.860> clean<00:07:35.760> some<00:07:36.760> of<00:07:36.790> the

00:07:36.930 --> 00:07:36.940 
they'll break pretty clean some of the

00:07:36.940 --> 00:07:40.200 
they'll break pretty clean some of the
refills<00:07:37.360> have<00:07:37.600> barbed<00:07:38.020> rails<00:07:38.260> if<00:07:39.250> you<00:07:39.940> want<00:07:40.120> to

00:07:40.200 --> 00:07:40.210 
refills have barbed rails if you want to

00:07:40.210 --> 00:07:42.120 
refills have barbed rails if you want to
use<00:07:40.390> this<00:07:40.600> method<00:07:41.050> to<00:07:41.080> get<00:07:41.230> the<00:07:41.410> refill<00:07:41.800> in<00:07:41.980> and

00:07:42.120 --> 00:07:42.130 
use this method to get the refill in and

00:07:42.130 --> 00:07:44.760 
use this method to get the refill in and
out<00:07:42.250> it's<00:07:42.940> easier<00:07:43.510> if<00:07:43.780> the<00:07:43.930> rails<00:07:44.140> don't<00:07:44.500> have

00:07:44.760 --> 00:07:44.770 
out it's easier if the rails don't have

00:07:44.770 --> 00:07:47.250 
out it's easier if the rails don't have
the<00:07:44.950> barbs<00:07:45.340> so<00:07:46.300> you<00:07:46.390> can<00:07:46.630> break<00:07:46.870> the<00:07:47.020> barbed

00:07:47.250 --> 00:07:47.260 
the barbs so you can break the barbed

00:07:47.260 --> 00:07:49.740 
the barbs so you can break the barbed
section<00:07:47.860> off<00:07:48.040> then<00:07:48.820> make<00:07:49.090> the<00:07:49.210> rest<00:07:49.420> of<00:07:49.540> the
