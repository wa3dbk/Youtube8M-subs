00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.480
 Hello and welcome 

00:00:01.650 --> 00:00:05.279
 love to be friends my name is - and 

00:00:03.480 --> 00:00:08.040
 that here are the daily news with today 

00:00:05.279 --> 00:00:12.080
 themes like gta mortal kombat witcher 3 

00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:12.080
 and what we will still come up with 

00:00:13.969 --> 00:00:18.390
 So first question directly in advance to you 

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:20.250
 on the topic of daily news I have that yes 

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:22.380
 last weeks twice a week makes 

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:23.850
 on Wednesdays and Sundays now 

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:25.740
 but I notice that just the Wednesdays 

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:27.449
 Follow the call pay relatively 

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:28.920
 depends heavily on you so you have 

00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:30.660
 Bock on it that I twice 

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:31.920
 the week makes if you could 

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:33.469
 now give the thumbs up 

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:38.160
 or in the comments 

00:00:33.469 --> 00:00:40.379
 comment on short numbers and facts 

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:42.180
 check to gta and indeed has been 

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:45.719
 announce that gta 5 

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:48.660
 now over 45 million times 

00:00:45.719 --> 00:00:50.730
 Oh my god has sold it alone 

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:52.949
 Ten million times out of the xbox man 

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:55.860
 or the playstation 4 and in total 

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:58.469
 have 24 million players 

00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:59.940
 meanwhile in the online mode of gta 

00:00:58.469 --> 00:01:01.410
 5 found 

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:03.600
 I think that's a great idea 

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:05.880
 number is probably would have even more if 

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:08.510
 ye times we finally pc player with 

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:11.250
 could take into account 

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:13.170
 more news about gta is easy 

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:14.820
 that's really about gta right now 

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:17.549
 think six and that even 

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:19.200
 publicly admit so that with so 

00:01:17.549 --> 00:01:21.299
 a series always comes a part 

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:24.090
 if that's so many millions of times 

00:01:21.299 --> 00:01:25.890
 sold and so is an enormous cash cow 

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:27.000
 So yes that brings money and coal for 

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:29.430
 rockstar without end 

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:31.439
 I feel it really as 

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:33.990
 insolence towards the pc players 

00:01:31.439 --> 00:01:35.759
 now from gta to six publicly 

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:37.470
 while he does not even speak it 

00:01:35.759 --> 00:01:39.990
 have made you go for the open 

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:42.869
 to releasen pc and therefore there's of 

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:44.720
 Unfortunately for me the thumb of the day 

00:01:42.869 --> 00:01:46.950
 downward 

00:01:44.720 --> 00:01:48.780
 since at least since the last one 

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:49.950
 tomb raider again real lara croft 

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:51.210
 I became a friend today 

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:53.909
 tomorrow especially pleased that the 

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:55.799
 Gameinformer rausgehauen following video 

00:01:53.909 --> 00:01:58.920
 In which one also has a few new ones 

00:01:55.799 --> 00:02:01.159
 artworks to the upcoming tomb raider rise 

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:04.500
 of the tomb raider that's what I think 

00:02:01.159 --> 00:02:06.479
 shows and that would be mine now 

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:10.310
 you my tip of the day is so far 

00:02:06.479 --> 00:02:10.310
 keep croft friends 

00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:20.070
 mortal kombat including Finnish the 

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:21.870
 It's kind of a series I have 

00:02:20.070 --> 00:02:23.520
 felt played 20 years ago 

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:24.750
 and it still amazes me that 

00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:27.150
 the same game over and over again 

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:29.190
 rauskommt the graphics looks better 

00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:30.900
 and there was a new one too 

00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:33.150
 trailer me would be easy 

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:34.980
 Are you interested in whether you think so 

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:36.390
 That's enough 

00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:38.280
 just to do the same again and again 

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:40.440
 to polish up the graphic so okay there is 

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:42.630
 new the stages are partial 

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:44.580
 variable the fights are action packed 

00:02:42.630 --> 00:02:46.410
 the movement and so in the reason 

00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:52.830
 it is still unchanged 

00:02:46.410 --> 00:02:54.120
 same game or not yes and then 

00:02:52.830 --> 00:02:56.640
 Again a short invention of me 

00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:58.650
 Battlefield 4 Murder Battlefield Hotline 

00:02:56.640 --> 00:03:00.240
 Of course, it's now up to date as beta 

00:02:58.650 --> 00:03:02.459
 available if I'm not mistaken 

00:03:00.240 --> 00:03:03.930
 a total of five days from the third 

00:03:02.459 --> 00:03:05.670
 february to the 8th i have the whole thing 

00:03:03.930 --> 00:03:07.950
 already downloaded there are three 

00:03:05.670 --> 00:03:09.810
 game modes and three cards are playing 

00:03:07.950 --> 00:03:11.370
 I also have a lot of variety now 

00:03:09.810 --> 00:03:13.080
 but honestly confesses looks after 

00:03:11.370 --> 00:03:17.269
 as before, of course, like the graphics 

00:03:13.080 --> 00:03:19.560
 a modification of battlefield 4 

00:03:17.269 --> 00:03:21.030
 Lackovic 3 you could actually anyone 

00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:22.860
 daily news what to say to be exact 

00:03:21.030 --> 00:03:25.050
 there is actually day by day witcher 3 

00:03:22.860 --> 00:03:27.239
 news and it probably will too 

00:03:25.050 --> 00:03:28.920
 do not change until the release I have 

00:03:27.239 --> 00:03:30.690
 currently the feeling it is always 

00:03:28.920 --> 00:03:32.760
 still so small but a fun fact 

00:03:30.690 --> 00:03:36.540
 Maybe that would be the cd 

00:03:32.760 --> 00:03:39.000
 project a total of 16 hours sex 

00:03:36.540 --> 00:03:41.160
 material on the roman furger 3 so 

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:43.110
 will soon be found too 

00:03:41.160 --> 00:03:46.170
 youporn with the best ten 

00:03:43.110 --> 00:03:47.940
 the gerald the witcher with jennifer and ko 

00:03:46.170 --> 00:03:50.040
 but in fact they will have it 

00:03:47.940 --> 00:03:51.510
 said that they are not the complete 16 

00:03:50.040 --> 00:03:52.980
 hours have written to play purely 

00:03:51.510 --> 00:03:53.970
 of course I ask myself dear 

00:03:52.980 --> 00:03:57.600
 developer friends why do you have 

00:03:53.970 --> 00:03:59.400
 that's what so many people are recording 

00:03:57.600 --> 00:04:00.810
 new call of duty announced the old one 

00:03:59.400 --> 00:04:03.510
 call of duty is not too long 

00:04:00.810 --> 00:04:06.299
 but sad there are the developers 

00:04:03.510 --> 00:04:08.190
 from black place and also the first time the 

00:04:06.299 --> 00:04:10.290
 zombie mode in call of duty led 

00:04:08.190 --> 00:04:14.100
 have tweeted or have now 

00:04:10.290 --> 00:04:16.620
 Started a countdown and with the 

00:04:14.100 --> 00:04:18.959
 hashtag zombies and there it turns 

00:04:16.620 --> 00:04:21.299
 of course the question already announce 

00:04:18.959 --> 00:04:21.750
 the new call of duty black ops to what 

00:04:21.299 --> 00:04:23.160
 the 

00:04:21.750 --> 00:04:24.930
 possibly develop for november 

00:04:23.160 --> 00:04:26.820
 but that would usually be too 

00:04:24.930 --> 00:04:29.610
 that is usually always early 

00:04:26.820 --> 00:04:31.470
 so my opinion may june announced 

00:04:29.610 --> 00:04:33.180
 So it was about a call of duty 

00:04:31.470 --> 00:04:35.010
 appears half a year later comes the 

00:04:33.180 --> 00:04:36.390
 Announcement for the next half year 

00:04:35.010 --> 00:04:37.770
 later the thing is back and that 

00:04:36.390 --> 00:04:39.300
 they've been doing it for years 

00:04:37.770 --> 00:04:41.520
 that's why it would be surprising now 

00:04:39.300 --> 00:04:42.990
 that you already announce in january 

00:04:41.520 --> 00:04:44.490
 could 

00:04:42.990 --> 00:04:46.260
 but now it could be that the 

00:04:44.490 --> 00:04:48.900
 in fact, maybe your own 

00:04:46.260 --> 00:04:50.970
 rows in the call of duty zombie litter 

00:04:48.900 --> 00:04:52.980
 So what would that do? 

00:04:50.970 --> 00:04:54.660
 prevent call of duty series like that 

00:04:52.980 --> 00:04:56.580
 it makes battlefield with battlefield 3 

00:04:54.660 --> 00:04:58.320
 again completely independent game too 

00:04:56.580 --> 00:05:02.419
 make and I would honestly a 

00:04:58.320 --> 00:05:07.100
 pure call of duty zombies mega free 

00:05:02.419 --> 00:05:08.730
 short update to the ubisoft far cry 4 key 

00:05:07.100 --> 00:05:10.169
 scandal story so say that 

00:05:08.730 --> 00:05:11.460
 at least a relatively large number of you 

00:05:10.169 --> 00:05:13.640
 I have recommended in the last one 

00:05:11.460 --> 00:05:16.230
 week reported that ubisoft 

00:05:13.640 --> 00:05:19.169
 various keys have the lock over 

00:05:16.230 --> 00:05:22.200
 key stores such as g2 bought 

00:05:19.169 --> 00:05:25.020
 since this gravel as well as ubisoft says 

00:05:22.200 --> 00:05:27.660
 illegal by credit card fraud from the 

00:05:25.020 --> 00:05:29.640
 origins gate bought by electronic arts 

00:05:27.660 --> 00:05:30.840
 Steal anyway , so live in 

00:05:29.640 --> 00:05:33.300
 it really did that there 

00:05:30.840 --> 00:05:35.280
 ubisoft and collaborate and one in 

00:05:33.300 --> 00:05:37.860
 ea store gets games from ubisoft 

00:05:35.280 --> 00:05:39.390
 just like the other way around 

00:05:37.860 --> 00:05:41.430
 ubisoft then first said that they 

00:05:39.390 --> 00:05:43.020
 really that is by fraudulent 

00:05:41.430 --> 00:05:44.160
 methods credit card fraud just 

00:05:43.020 --> 00:05:46.290
 and then bought 

00:05:44.160 --> 00:05:49.080
 resold were locked at 

00:05:46.290 --> 00:05:51.240
 user that gave a wave of indignation and 

00:05:49.080 --> 00:05:54.030
 now there is just the update to that 

00:05:51.240 --> 00:05:56.610
 ubisoft obviously this gravel yet 

00:05:54.030 --> 00:05:58.860
 and reactivated attention once again 

00:05:56.610 --> 00:06:00.900
 that's really the game of yours 

00:05:58.860 --> 00:06:03.270
 already started and activated and 

00:06:00.900 --> 00:06:03.510
 was registered and played what knows 

00:06:03.270 --> 00:06:05.310
 I 

00:06:03.510 --> 00:06:08.310
 it looks apparently different but at 

00:06:05.310 --> 00:06:10.380
 play with those stolen gravel 

00:06:08.310 --> 00:06:12.540
 should be restarted now 

00:06:10.380 --> 00:06:14.100
 probably directly restarted prevented 

00:06:12.540 --> 00:06:15.750
 but stay if you can 

00:06:14.100 --> 00:06:16.470
 just should have bought me 

00:06:15.750 --> 00:06:18.990
 sometimes interested 

00:06:16.470 --> 00:06:22.260
 away from the big scream who was 

00:06:18.990 --> 00:06:24.580
 really affected by you 

00:06:22.260 --> 00:06:28.000
 short update there was one more time 

00:06:24.580 --> 00:06:29.800
 to the zombie spectacle of techland there him 

00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:31.210
 I am sorry for myself, too 

00:06:29.800 --> 00:06:32.110
 have played far and gone and me 

00:06:31.210 --> 00:06:33.550
 really like it 

00:06:32.110 --> 00:06:35.020
 and there have been in recent days too 

00:06:33.550 --> 00:06:36.940
 so a bit cry out the modding 

00:06:35.020 --> 00:06:39.220
 community and allegedly was with the 

00:06:36.940 --> 00:06:41.110
 last patch that kills as well as 

00:06:39.220 --> 00:06:43.780
 impossible and should indeed 

00:06:41.110 --> 00:06:45.040
 also different effects like the 

00:06:43.780 --> 00:06:47.380
 Griesel filter that you turn off 

00:06:45.040 --> 00:06:49.480
 could as mod that supposedly out 

00:06:47.380 --> 00:06:50.740
 have been removed from the network and 

00:06:49.480 --> 00:06:52.630
 techland has now this again 

00:06:50.740 --> 00:06:53.920
 apologized and said that would be 

00:06:52.630 --> 00:06:55.650
 not your intention was the mod 

00:06:53.920 --> 00:06:57.790
 Community yes somehow slow down 

00:06:55.650 --> 00:07:00.010
 but only the last one should 

00:06:57.790 --> 00:07:02.380
 patch cause that in this zombie 

00:07:00.010 --> 00:07:04.090
 versus mode as there are not any 

00:07:02.380 --> 00:07:07.390
 create illegal benefits 

00:07:04.090 --> 00:07:08.290
 against other players so they 

00:07:07.390 --> 00:07:10.570
 but then said basically 

00:07:08.290 --> 00:07:11.680
 thumbs up for the mod community 

00:07:10.570 --> 00:07:14.530
 I always think I'm curious 

00:07:11.680 --> 00:07:17.260
 out when we update it with even 

00:07:14.530 --> 00:07:21.970
 bloodier and even better textured 

00:07:17.260 --> 00:07:23.410
 zombies are getting so that was it 

00:07:21.970 --> 00:07:24.910
 also again with the daily news on 

00:07:23.410 --> 00:07:26.170
 Wednesday and as I said if you 

00:07:24.910 --> 00:07:27.490
 continue to have it on that 

00:07:26.170 --> 00:07:29.050
 format twice a week then comes 

00:07:27.490 --> 00:07:30.340
 thumb up now I just need 

00:07:29.050 --> 00:07:32.380
 any support from you i 

00:07:30.340 --> 00:07:34.720
 can receive quite cordial
