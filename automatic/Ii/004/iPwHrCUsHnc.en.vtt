 It is said that 1.4 out of 10 new cars sold as of this year hit. 

00:00:33.040 --> 00:00:43.160
 It is the highest level ever since the opening of the market in 1987 

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:44.330
 Among the 27 imported car brands in Korea, Audi is especially eye-

00:00:54.440 --> 00:01:01.880
 Audi Folia's thunderstorm report board 

00:00:58.280 --> 00:01:06.800

 The yearly sales volume of last year was over 500c. 

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:28.210
 Audi is a high performance model that boasts powerful driving performance and striking design. 

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:34.450
 At its heart is a7 55 pdi to introduce today 

00:01:28.210 --> 00:01:36.130
 Audi Korea launched the domestic high-performance diesel model i7 55 key 

00:01:34.450 --> 00:01:38.770
 Dia. 

00:01:36.130 --> 00:01:43.079
 But the name is unusual to suffer 

00:01:38.770 --> 00:01:43.079
 What does the number 15 mean? 

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:51.290
 a7 55 tdi is the vehicle acceleration performance value 

00:01:49.909 --> 00:01:55.090
 Utilize and destroy 

00:01:51.290 --> 00:01:55.090
 This is a model with dynamic lift . 

00:01:55.100 --> 00:02:02.869
 The acceleration performance of this vehicle is 55 when the gravitational acceleration is 100 per week . 

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:09.080
 It means to reach. 

00:02:02.869 --> 00:02:11.870
 4 It's very difficult. Simply stated, the engine output is pulled up to accelerate 

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:18.019
 Maximize it. 

00:02:11.870 --> 00:02:22.700
 Indeed a7 55 tbi than the engine of the existing a7 3.0 tdi 

00:02:18.019 --> 00:02:25.519
 Boasts 68 hp and 313 hp 

00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:28.549
 The 3,000cc engine displacement is the same. 

00:02:25.519 --> 00:02:33.650
 Performance is much better 

00:02:28.549 --> 00:02:36.680
 So we look into the difficult formula of gravitational acceleration, not engine displacement. 

00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:39.470
 I have named it 

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:44.209
 So let's look at the design now. 

00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:50.030
 Audi models with odd numbers behind like a7 and a5 

00:02:44.209 --> 00:02:53.120
 The mod Ford off-farm looks soft and sleek 

00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:58.599
 The first thing that comes to your eyes. 

00:02:53.120 --> 00:03:01.370
 The headlamps of the impressive impression are Audi's first full- 

00:02:58.599 --> 00:03:04.159
 Headlight applied. 

00:03:01.370 --> 00:03:08.540
 I feel my strength in the presence full of 

00:03:04.159 --> 00:03:14.180
 Tail lamps on the rear also bear the 4t arm 

00:03:08.540 --> 00:03:17.510
 The rear spoiler's automatically going up by more than a key poison 130km 

00:03:14.180 --> 00:03:22.549
 The interior seems to emphasize elegance. 

00:03:17.510 --> 00:03:26.329
 The wooden dÃ©cor applied to the dashboard and center fesia cried especially 

00:03:22.549 --> 00:03:28.730
 Aegis has a good mix of analog and digital 

00:03:26.329 --> 00:03:33.620
 The center tunnel touchpad 

00:03:28.730 --> 00:03:35.650
 Although a little practice is needed, it will be useful for navigation and searching . 

00:03:33.620 --> 00:03:42.340
 The same 

00:03:35.650 --> 00:03:47.250
 Ted One Piece Play-D Look . 

00:03:42.340 --> 00:03:47.250
 I'll start it now. 

00:03:48.180 --> 00:03:58.010
 Not undergo the color is not greater than anticipated 

00:03:53.050 --> 00:04:02.780
 Secrets Sounds unique but soft and quiet 

00:03:58.010 --> 00:04:05.900
 This is also thanks to the engine i7 55 tdi engine 

00:04:02.780 --> 00:04:09.470
 Rated the quietest of vision engines 

00:04:05.900 --> 00:04:14.470
 Audi v6 is 3,000cc &amp; 

00:04:09.470 --> 00:04:14.470
 I installed two towers here to boost the output. 

00:04:15.490 --> 00:04:24.040
 a7 50 yuan pdi is running all over 

00:04:20.049 --> 00:04:28.480
 There are things to be aware of when a train starts two lines 

00:04:24.040 --> 00:04:34.360
 You should not be surprised at the momentary acceleration of more than you expect. 

00:04:28.480 --> 00:04:37.420
 The maximum torque of the i7 woo tdi is 66.3 kg and 4 

00:04:34.360 --> 00:04:40.510
 Once the average portable waterfall of medium-sized 

00:04:37.420 --> 00:04:47.060
 25kg 2 marks are hidden 

00:04:40.510 --> 00:04:52.550
 I imagined how the car would react when I gave the power of Del Lita. 

00:04:47.060 --> 00:04:55.180
 The maximum torque of the foreign country is calculated from the previous engine, rp , 

00:04:52.550 --> 00:04:55.180
 Appears 

00:04:55.340 --> 00:05:01.560
 Even with a little force on the frame 

00:04:57.470 --> 00:05:05.849
 The tongue reacts like it bounces. 

00:05:01.560 --> 00:05:08.999
 However, it is such a bad acceleration accelerating squeeze. 

00:05:05.849 --> 00:05:14.219
 Im just that easy all the time pushing strong 

00:05:08.999 --> 00:05:17.879
 The feeling was posted in straight-running at a speed 

00:05:14.219 --> 00:05:24.270
 My knight 4 is about to rise. 

00:05:17.879 --> 00:05:27.590
 Zero back of the train, the time from stop to reaching 100km 

00:05:24.270 --> 00:05:27.590
 5 points is enough 

00:05:27.629 --> 00:05:34.430
 It literally speeds up the time but does not feel the shock of the transmission almost 

00:05:34.469 --> 00:05:43.080
 8-Woven Tiptronic automatic transmission with manual and automatic throttle 

00:05:38.819 --> 00:05:45.389
 It's a moment of proud performance. 

00:05:43.080 --> 00:05:49.650
 The car met the new government. 

00:05:45.389 --> 00:05:54.360
 a7 Neighbors confirmed donor ring performance of sub tbi 

00:05:49.650 --> 00:05:56.689
 This car, too, is an all-4-wheel drive system that Audi is proud of . 

00:05:54.360 --> 00:06:01.250
 Let's 

00:05:56.689 --> 00:06:06.650
 Audi is trying to get the most out of the output of the model, not the tote . 

00:06:01.250 --> 00:06:12.620
 It might be just a quatro. 

00:06:06.650 --> 00:06:18.379
 It is said that the driver's passion for speed is unknown to all four wheels . 

00:06:12.620 --> 00:06:24.409
 Here was a strong national strength in context to give up social toktok one of the demonstrations that 

00:06:18.379 --> 00:06:27.190
 It is a pleasure to enforce Dunn knitting reliable driving on any huroring 

00:06:24.409 --> 00:06:30.879
 It's all over. 

00:06:27.190 --> 00:06:36.180

00:06:30.879 --> 00:06:36.180
 No fashion in Alatan adds fun to driving 

00:06:36.250 --> 00:06:44.510
 Given the performance, fuel economy is a passing point. 

00:06:39.550 --> 00:06:47.210
 Complex expensive your father comes and 7km Tae time 

00:06:44.510 --> 00:06:50.210
