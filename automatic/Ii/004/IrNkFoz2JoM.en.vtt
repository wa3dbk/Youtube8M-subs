that I use English courts differed to

to shed off it similar to a road the
problem<00:00:41.469> with<00:00:41.620> this<00:00:41.710> open<00:00:42.070> tension<00:00:42.460> material

00:00:42.959 --> 00:00:42.969 
problem with this open tension material

00:00:42.969 --> 00:00:45.240 
problem with this open tension material
is<00:00:43.390> that<00:00:43.600> only<00:00:43.809> the<00:00:44.140> individual<00:00:44.649> grains<00:00:44.949> of

00:00:45.240 --> 00:00:45.250 
is that only the individual grains of

00:00:45.250 --> 00:00:47.639 
is that only the individual grains of
asphalt<00:00:45.609> are<00:00:45.940> coated<00:00:46.269> in<00:00:46.390> bitumen<00:00:46.719> and<00:00:46.989> they

00:00:47.639 --> 00:00:47.649 
asphalt are coated in bitumen and they

00:00:47.649 --> 00:00:49.560 
asphalt are coated in bitumen and they
are<00:00:47.710> deer<00:00:47.949> together<00:00:48.339> only<00:00:49.089> where<00:00:49.239> they<00:00:49.359> touch

00:00:49.560 --> 00:00:49.570 
are deer together only where they touch

00:00:49.570 --> 00:00:52.740 
are deer together only where they touch
each<00:00:49.780> other<00:00:50.789> the<00:00:51.789> gaps<00:00:52.030> between<00:00:52.239> the<00:00:52.510> grains

00:00:52.740 --> 00:00:52.750 
each other the gaps between the grains

00:00:52.750 --> 00:00:54.569 
each other the gaps between the grains
therefore<00:00:53.350> become<00:00:53.649> a<00:00:53.679> perfect<00:00:54.160> place<00:00:54.339> for

00:00:54.569 --> 00:00:54.579 
therefore become a perfect place for

00:00:54.579 --> 00:00:57.779 
therefore become a perfect place for
moss<00:00:55.030> to<00:00:55.239> grow<00:00:55.269> and<00:00:55.980> also<00:00:56.980> grass<00:00:57.190> seeds<00:00:57.519> that

00:00:57.779 --> 00:00:57.789 
moss to grow and also grass seeds that

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:03.190 
the wind with time the bitumen oxidizes

00:01:03.190 --> 00:01:05.130 
the wind with time the bitumen oxidizes
and<00:01:03.699> the<00:01:03.850> grains<00:01:04.120> lose<00:01:04.420> their<00:01:04.629> hold<00:01:04.809> on<00:01:04.960> each

00:01:05.130 --> 00:01:05.140 
and the grains lose their hold on each

00:01:05.140 --> 00:01:08.310 
and the grains lose their hold on each
other<00:01:05.409> as<00:01:05.620> can<00:01:05.920> be<00:01:06.010> shown<00:01:06.190> here<00:01:06.580> a<00:01:07.320> combination

of this oxidation and the moss will

00:01:10.390 --> 00:01:11.880 
of this oxidation and the moss will
eventually<00:01:10.810> start<00:01:11.110> to<00:01:11.200> lift<00:01:11.440> out<00:01:11.620> those

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:11.890 
eventually start to lift out those

00:01:11.890 --> 00:01:14.340 
eventually start to lift out those
individual<00:01:12.550> grains<00:01:12.880> and<00:01:13.240> de-stressing<00:01:14.230> of

the court starts occurring it is

00:01:16.810 --> 00:01:18.960 
the court starts occurring it is
therefore<00:01:17.140> essential<00:01:17.410> that<00:01:18.310> the<00:01:18.490> courts<00:01:18.850> are

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:18.970 
therefore essential that the courts are

00:01:18.970 --> 00:01:21.600 
therefore essential that the courts are
kept<00:01:19.180> clean<00:01:19.510> moss<00:01:20.320> removed<00:01:20.740> and<00:01:21.010> the<00:01:21.340> court

kept clean moss removed and the court

00:01:21.610 --> 00:01:23.820 
kept clean moss removed and the court
painted<00:01:22.150> to<00:01:22.480> slow<00:01:22.750> down<00:01:23.050> the<00:01:23.380> oxidation
