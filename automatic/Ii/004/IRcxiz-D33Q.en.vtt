00:00:09.040 --> 00:00:09.050 
this is my exhibition the places we live

00:00:09.050 --> 00:00:11.450 
this is my exhibition the places we live
yeah<00:00:10.050> of<00:00:10.440> all<00:00:10.590> the<00:00:10.710> projects<00:00:11.099> I've<00:00:11.219> done<00:00:11.429> I

yeah of all the projects I've done I

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:13.789 
yeah of all the projects I've done I
think<00:00:11.639> this<00:00:11.880> one<00:00:12.059> was<00:00:12.210> the<00:00:12.240> easiest<00:00:12.900> in<00:00:13.469> terms

00:00:13.789 --> 00:00:13.799 
think this one was the easiest in terms

00:00:13.799 --> 00:00:16.939 
think this one was the easiest in terms
of<00:00:14.040> getting<00:00:14.580> access<00:00:14.880> to<00:00:15.330> to<00:00:15.870> families<00:00:16.440> getting

00:00:16.939 --> 00:00:16.949 
of getting access to to families getting

00:00:16.949 --> 00:00:22.970 
of getting access to to families getting
access<00:00:17.550> to<00:00:17.730> people's<00:00:18.029> homes<00:00:21.470> basically<00:00:22.470> it's

00:00:22.970 --> 00:00:22.980 
access to people's homes basically it's

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:27.439 
access to people's homes basically it's
a<00:00:23.189> very<00:00:23.400> interactive<00:00:23.760> project<00:00:26.300> here<00:00:27.300> I'm

project I think if people sort of caught

00:00:56.940 --> 00:00:59.689 
project I think if people sort of caught
up<00:00:57.149> on<00:00:57.300> that<00:00:57.510> and<00:00:57.780> and<00:00:57.930> I<00:00:58.440> found<00:00:59.190> people<00:00:59.340> very
