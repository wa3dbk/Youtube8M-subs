00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:11.010 
realize at the surface that sounds so

00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:14.360 
realize at the surface that sounds so
simple<00:00:11.700> but<00:00:12.330> in<00:00:12.509> today's<00:00:12.840> complex<00:00:13.679> lifestyle

00:00:14.360 --> 00:00:14.370 
simple but in today's complex lifestyle

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:17.180 
simple but in today's complex lifestyle
and<00:00:14.880> societal<00:00:15.509> expectations<00:00:16.440> it<00:00:16.680> is<00:00:16.740> a<00:00:16.859> very

00:00:17.180 --> 00:00:17.190 
and societal expectations it is a very

and societal expectations it is a very
very<00:00:17.600> difficult<00:00:18.600> thing<00:00:18.900> to<00:00:19.109> do<00:00:19.380> because<00:00:19.500> we're

00:00:19.730 --> 00:00:19.740 
very difficult thing to do because we're

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:22.279 
very difficult thing to do because we're
so<00:00:20.100> plugged<00:00:20.430> into<00:00:20.670> culture<00:00:21.330> expectations<00:00:22.080> of

00:00:22.279 --> 00:00:22.289 
so plugged into culture expectations of

00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:24.859 
so plugged into culture expectations of
thinness<00:00:22.769> and<00:00:23.220> this<00:00:23.369> idea<00:00:23.760> that<00:00:24.060> you<00:00:24.600> know<00:00:24.720> we

00:00:24.859 --> 00:00:24.869 
thinness and this idea that you know we

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:26.509 
thinness and this idea that you know we
can<00:00:24.990> drop<00:00:25.170> weight<00:00:25.410> any<00:00:25.619> way<00:00:25.769> we<00:00:25.859> want<00:00:26.010> to<00:00:26.130> and

00:00:26.509 --> 00:00:26.519 
can drop weight any way we want to and

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:28.790 
can drop weight any way we want to and
sculpt<00:00:26.820> our<00:00:27.000> bodies<00:00:27.390> and<00:00:27.720> yet<00:00:27.930> over<00:00:28.140> and<00:00:28.590> over

00:00:28.790 --> 00:00:28.800 
sculpt our bodies and yet over and over

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:30.169 
sculpt our bodies and yet over and over
and<00:00:28.920> over<00:00:29.039> again<00:00:29.279> the<00:00:29.609> research<00:00:29.910> keeps

00:00:30.169 --> 00:00:30.179 
and over again the research keeps

00:00:30.179 --> 00:00:32.209 
and over again the research keeps
showing<00:00:30.599> us<00:00:30.750> that<00:00:30.990> this<00:00:31.199> does<00:00:31.710> not<00:00:31.740> work

00:00:32.209 --> 00:00:32.219 
showing us that this does not work

00:00:32.219 --> 00:00:34.670 
showing us that this does not work
dieting<00:00:32.910> does<00:00:33.180> not<00:00:33.360> work<00:00:33.540> and<00:00:33.719> furthermore<00:00:34.020> it

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:34.680 
dieting does not work and furthermore it

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:37.850 
dieting does not work and furthermore it
can<00:00:34.710> really<00:00:34.980> cause<00:00:35.219> a<00:00:35.579> lot<00:00:35.730> of<00:00:35.760> harm<00:00:36.860> certainly

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:37.860 
can really cause a lot of harm certainly

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:40.430 
can really cause a lot of harm certainly
can<00:00:38.329> but<00:00:39.329> do<00:00:39.690> you<00:00:39.809> think<00:00:40.050> it's<00:00:40.170> really

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:40.440 
can but do you think it's really

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:43.459 
can but do you think it's really
possible<00:00:40.739> to<00:00:41.700> eat<00:00:41.879> intuitively<00:00:42.480> in<00:00:43.079> our

I I do and I've been asked that question

many times and there's been some

you know portion sizes that are you know
triple<00:01:07.590> and<00:01:07.740> quadruple<00:01:07.920> what<00:01:08.250> we'd<00:01:08.369> ever

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:08.520 
triple and quadruple what we'd ever

thought<00:01:08.700> that<00:01:08.909> would<00:01:09.030> be<00:01:09.060> and<00:01:09.720> my<00:01:10.140> answer<00:01:10.560> is

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:10.590 
thought that would be and my answer is

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:13.370 
thought that would be and my answer is
yes<00:01:11.070> it's<00:01:11.700> possible<00:01:11.970> to<00:01:12.450> eat<00:01:12.630> intuitively<00:01:13.140> in

00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:13.380 
yes it's possible to eat intuitively in

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:16.130 
yes it's possible to eat intuitively in
this<00:01:13.500> environment<00:01:14.030> however<00:01:15.030> it<00:01:15.540> takes<00:01:15.900> an

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:16.140 
this environment however it takes an

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:18.289 
this environment however it takes an
extra<00:01:16.560> level<00:01:16.770> of<00:01:17.009> mindfulness<00:01:17.610> than<00:01:18.119> it

00:01:18.289 --> 00:01:18.299 
extra level of mindfulness than it

00:01:18.299 --> 00:01:20.330 
extra level of mindfulness than it
didn't<00:01:18.659> what<00:01:18.780> it<00:01:18.900> used<00:01:19.080> to<00:01:19.200> do<00:01:19.439> and<00:01:19.920> frankly

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:20.340 
didn't what it used to do and frankly

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:22.100 
didn't what it used to do and frankly
you<00:01:20.729> know<00:01:20.820> we<00:01:20.939> hear<00:01:21.180> all<00:01:21.299> this<00:01:21.450> stuff<00:01:21.689> about<00:01:21.840> oh

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:22.110 
you know we hear all this stuff about oh

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:24.140 
you know we hear all this stuff about oh
my<00:01:22.259> gosh<00:01:22.500> the<00:01:22.950> portions<00:01:23.369> are<00:01:23.460> so<00:01:23.670> panicked

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:24.150 
my gosh the portions are so panicked

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:25.550 
my gosh the portions are so panicked
that's<00:01:24.390> why<00:01:24.479> we're<00:01:24.630> having<00:01:24.750> weight<00:01:25.080> problems

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:25.560 
that's why we're having weight problems

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:28.370 
that's why we're having weight problems
but<00:01:25.950> the<00:01:26.100> truth<00:01:26.400> is<00:01:26.700> if<00:01:27.299> we<00:01:27.360> were<00:01:27.630> really<00:01:27.990> cute

00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:28.380 
but the truth is if we were really cute

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:30.440 
but the truth is if we were really cute
in<00:01:28.530> to<00:01:28.799> hunger<00:01:29.159> and<00:01:29.280> fullness<00:01:29.490> and<00:01:30.000> we<00:01:30.119> knew<00:01:30.299> we

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:30.450 
in to hunger and fullness and we knew we

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:32.210 
in to hunger and fullness and we knew we
can<00:01:30.570> have<00:01:30.689> food<00:01:30.810> whenever<00:01:30.990> we<00:01:31.229> want<00:01:31.500> to<00:01:31.740> it

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:32.220 
can have food whenever we want to it

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:33.380 
can have food whenever we want to it
wouldn't<00:01:32.549> matter<00:01:32.700> if<00:01:32.790> they<00:01:32.939> served<00:01:33.210> you<00:01:33.360> a

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:33.390 
wouldn't matter if they served you a

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:35.929 
wouldn't matter if they served you a
20-pound<00:01:33.960> steak<00:01:34.320> or<00:01:34.619> a<00:01:34.650> 10<00:01:35.100> ounce<00:01:35.280> steak<00:01:35.610> you

00:01:35.929 --> 00:01:35.939 
20-pound steak or a 10 ounce steak you

00:01:35.939 --> 00:01:37.310 
20-pound steak or a 10 ounce steak you
would<00:01:36.090> still<00:01:36.360> stop<00:01:36.720> when<00:01:36.930> you're<00:01:37.049> full<00:01:37.079> and

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:37.320 
would still stop when you're full and

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:38.870 
would still stop when you're full and
the<00:01:37.590> rest<00:01:37.799> would<00:01:37.890> be<00:01:38.040> left<00:01:38.250> for<00:01:38.460> you<00:01:38.759> know

00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:38.880 
the rest would be left for you know

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:43.569 
the rest would be left for you know
another<00:01:39.210> time<00:01:39.689> yeah<00:01:40.500> that<00:01:41.009> is<00:01:41.220> so<00:01:41.549> true<00:01:42.350> indeed

00:01:43.569 --> 00:01:43.579 
another time yeah that is so true indeed

00:01:43.579 --> 00:01:46.370 
another time yeah that is so true indeed
but<00:01:44.579> what's<00:01:44.790> the<00:01:44.970> harm<00:01:45.119> in<00:01:45.299> dieting<00:01:45.630> well

00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:46.380 
but what's the harm in dieting well

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:49.130 
but what's the harm in dieting well
there<00:01:47.159> are<00:01:47.340> so<00:01:47.610> many<00:01:47.850> levels<00:01:48.149> of<00:01:48.479> harm<00:01:48.750> and

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:49.140 
there are so many levels of harm and

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:52.670 
there are so many levels of harm and
gosh<00:01:50.130> from<00:01:50.610> the<00:01:51.060> number<00:01:51.420> one<00:01:51.450> fact<00:01:51.780> is<00:01:52.049> that<00:01:52.530> it

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:52.680 
gosh from the number one fact is that it

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:54.109 
gosh from the number one fact is that it
doesn't<00:01:53.040> work<00:01:53.159> you<00:01:53.369> know<00:01:53.430> and<00:01:53.520> you<00:01:53.880> might<00:01:54.000> be

00:01:54.109 --> 00:01:54.119 
doesn't work you know and you might be

00:01:54.119 --> 00:01:55.550 
doesn't work you know and you might be
thinking<00:01:54.149> well<00:01:54.450> gosh<00:01:54.479> we<00:01:54.930> here<00:01:55.079> studying<00:01:55.350> all

00:01:55.550 --> 00:01:55.560 
thinking well gosh we here studying all

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:57.050 
thinking well gosh we here studying all
the<00:01:55.680> time<00:01:55.710> saying<00:01:56.189> well<00:01:56.340> these<00:01:56.640> people<00:01:56.909> follow

00:01:57.050 --> 00:01:57.060 
the time saying well these people follow

00:01:57.060 --> 00:01:58.670 
the time saying well these people follow
this<00:01:57.210> diet<00:01:57.450> they<00:01:57.689> lost<00:01:57.899> X<00:01:58.170> amount<00:01:58.380> of<00:01:58.500> pounds

00:01:58.670 --> 00:01:58.680 
this diet they lost X amount of pounds

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:01.100 
this diet they lost X amount of pounds
and<00:01:59.189> one<00:01:59.640> of<00:01:59.729> the<00:01:59.790> gold<00:02:00.060> standards<00:02:00.210> any<00:02:00.840> time

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:01.110 
and one of the gold standards any time

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:03.120 
and one of the gold standards any time
we<00:02:01.229> see<00:02:01.259> research<00:02:01.829> coming<00:02:02.100> in<00:02:02.280> on<00:02:02.490> weight

00:02:03.120 --> 00:02:03.130 
we see research coming in on weight

00:02:03.130 --> 00:02:05.490 
we see research coming in on weight
diets<00:02:03.610> or<00:02:04.149> weight<00:02:04.329> loss<00:02:04.509> of<00:02:04.689> any<00:02:04.840> kind<00:02:05.110> of<00:02:05.170> sort

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:05.500 
diets or weight loss of any kind of sort

00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:07.620 
diets or weight loss of any kind of sort
of<00:02:05.560> management<00:02:06.009> it's<00:02:06.369> how<00:02:06.640> long<00:02:06.700> did<00:02:07.509> this

00:02:07.620 --> 00:02:07.630 
of management it's how long did this

00:02:07.630 --> 00:02:09.210 
of management it's how long did this
take<00:02:07.899> place<00:02:07.930> and<00:02:08.440> how<00:02:08.530> long<00:02:08.800> could<00:02:09.069> they

00:02:09.210 --> 00:02:09.220 
take place and how long could they

00:02:09.220 --> 00:02:12.030 
take place and how long could they
sustain<00:02:09.759> this<00:02:10.390> so-called<00:02:10.810> weight<00:02:11.020> loss<00:02:11.260> and

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:12.040 
sustain this so-called weight loss and

00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:14.309 
sustain this so-called weight loss and
the<00:02:12.220> real<00:02:12.430> benchmark<00:02:13.090> is<00:02:13.330> a<00:02:13.540> two<00:02:13.900> and<00:02:14.050> a<00:02:14.110> half

00:02:14.309 --> 00:02:14.319 
the real benchmark is a two and a half

00:02:14.319 --> 00:02:16.350 
the real benchmark is a two and a half
years<00:02:14.769> and<00:02:15.130> the<00:02:15.610> studies<00:02:15.880> that<00:02:16.060> usually<00:02:16.300> are

00:02:16.350 --> 00:02:16.360 
years and the studies that usually are

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:18.150 
years and the studies that usually are
coming<00:02:16.660> out<00:02:16.780> have<00:02:17.170> been<00:02:17.200> you<00:02:17.590> know<00:02:17.680> go<00:02:17.860> on<00:02:17.890> for

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:18.160 
coming out have been you know go on for

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:19.680 
coming out have been you know go on for
it<00:02:18.220> maybe<00:02:18.430> six<00:02:18.640> months<00:02:18.970> or<00:02:19.150> maybe<00:02:19.300> for<00:02:19.599> a<00:02:19.630> year

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:19.690 
it maybe six months or maybe for a year

00:02:19.690 --> 00:02:23.400 
it maybe six months or maybe for a year
so<00:02:20.590> it's<00:02:20.739> not<00:02:20.860> really<00:02:21.280> good<00:02:22.269> hallmark<00:02:22.810> the

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:23.410 
so it's not really good hallmark the

00:02:23.410 --> 00:02:25.650 
so it's not really good hallmark the
thing<00:02:23.620> that<00:02:23.769> really<00:02:24.099> concerns<00:02:24.459> me<00:02:25.060> is<00:02:25.330> all<00:02:25.510> the

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:25.660 
thing that really concerns me is all the

00:02:25.660 --> 00:02:27.509 
thing that really concerns me is all the
new<00:02:25.810> research<00:02:25.959> coming<00:02:26.410> out<00:02:26.590> on<00:02:26.739> teenagers<00:02:27.370> and

00:02:27.509 --> 00:02:27.519 
new research coming out on teenagers and

00:02:27.519 --> 00:02:29.640 
new research coming out on teenagers and
children<00:02:27.580> and<00:02:28.330> what<00:02:28.540> happens<00:02:28.900> to<00:02:29.050> them<00:02:29.230> if

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:29.650 
children and what happens to them if

00:02:29.650 --> 00:02:32.370 
children and what happens to them if
they<00:02:30.130> begin<00:02:30.400> a<00:02:30.550> diet<00:02:30.910> and<00:02:31.239> what<00:02:32.050> the<00:02:32.110> studies

00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:32.380 
they begin a diet and what the studies

00:02:32.380 --> 00:02:33.960 
they begin a diet and what the studies
have<00:02:32.470> shown<00:02:32.709> is<00:02:33.069> they<00:02:33.280> can<00:02:33.430> start<00:02:33.700> a<00:02:33.760> diet

00:02:33.960 --> 00:02:33.970 
have shown is they can start a diet

00:02:33.970 --> 00:02:35.370 
have shown is they can start a diet
let's<00:02:34.180> say<00:02:34.300> when<00:02:34.450> they're<00:02:34.599> a<00:02:34.630> freshman<00:02:35.170> and

00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:35.380 
let's say when they're a freshman and

00:02:35.380 --> 00:02:36.960 
let's say when they're a freshman and
when<00:02:35.860> the<00:02:35.980> researchers<00:02:36.310> go<00:02:36.459> back<00:02:36.640> and<00:02:36.819> follow

00:02:36.960 --> 00:02:36.970 
when the researchers go back and follow

00:02:36.970 --> 00:02:38.130 
when the researchers go back and follow
up<00:02:37.180> and<00:02:37.269> see<00:02:37.390> what's<00:02:37.540> happening<00:02:37.870> when<00:02:37.989> they're

00:02:38.130 --> 00:02:38.140 
up and see what's happening when they're

00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:40.680 
up and see what's happening when they're
a<00:02:38.170> senior<00:02:38.680> they<00:02:39.250> find<00:02:39.580> out<00:02:39.849> that<00:02:40.239> the<00:02:40.390> kids

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:40.690 
a senior they find out that the kids

00:02:40.690 --> 00:02:43.229 
a senior they find out that the kids
that<00:02:40.989> started<00:02:41.470> dieting<00:02:41.769> those<00:02:42.700> are<00:02:42.910> the<00:02:43.000> kids

00:02:43.229 --> 00:02:43.239 
that started dieting those are the kids

00:02:43.239 --> 00:02:44.880 
that started dieting those are the kids
that<00:02:43.599> are<00:02:43.840> gonna<00:02:43.900> be<00:02:44.049> more<00:02:44.260> likely<00:02:44.530> having

00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:44.890 
that are gonna be more likely having

00:02:44.890 --> 00:02:46.949 
that are gonna be more likely having
binge<00:02:45.370> problems<00:02:45.970> they<00:02:46.480> will<00:02:46.630> most<00:02:46.780> likely

00:02:46.949 --> 00:02:46.959 
binge problems they will most likely

00:02:46.959 --> 00:02:49.020 
binge problems they will most likely
have<00:02:47.470> weight<00:02:47.769> problems<00:02:48.340> and<00:02:48.549> what<00:02:48.640> they<00:02:48.730> found

00:02:49.020 --> 00:02:49.030 
have weight problems and what they found

00:02:49.030 --> 00:02:51.570 
have weight problems and what they found
and<00:02:49.180> this<00:02:49.239> astounds<00:02:49.930> me<00:02:50.110> is<00:02:50.410> that<00:02:50.830> dieting

00:02:51.570 --> 00:02:51.580 
and this astounds me is that dieting

00:02:51.580 --> 00:02:54.479 
and this astounds me is that dieting
predicts<00:02:52.330> weight<00:02:52.810> gain<00:02:53.349> and<00:02:53.860> these<00:02:54.220> weren't

00:02:54.479 --> 00:02:54.489 
predicts weight gain and these weren't

00:02:54.489 --> 00:02:56.190 
predicts weight gain and these weren't
kids<00:02:54.790> they<00:02:54.940> were<00:02:55.000> overweight<00:02:55.420> to<00:02:55.599> begin<00:02:55.930> with

00:02:56.190 --> 00:02:56.200 
kids they were overweight to begin with

00:02:56.200 --> 00:02:57.839 
kids they were overweight to begin with
and<00:02:56.500> I<00:02:56.560> just<00:02:56.829> wish<00:02:57.310> there<00:02:57.519> was<00:02:57.579> like<00:02:57.670> this

00:02:57.839 --> 00:02:57.849 
and I just wish there was like this

00:02:57.849 --> 00:03:00.210 
and I just wish there was like this
public<00:02:58.410> knowledge<00:02:59.410> or<00:02:59.799> health<00:03:00.040> information

00:03:00.210 --> 00:03:00.220 
public knowledge or health information

00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:02.460 
public knowledge or health information
that<00:03:00.730> you<00:03:00.940> know<00:03:01.060> what<00:03:01.239> if<00:03:01.390> you<00:03:01.510> diet<00:03:01.870> you<00:03:02.319> have

00:03:02.460 --> 00:03:02.470 
that you know what if you diet you have

00:03:02.470 --> 00:03:04.920 
that you know what if you diet you have
a<00:03:02.530> high<00:03:02.739> risk<00:03:02.980> of<00:03:03.099> becoming<00:03:03.250> overweight<00:03:04.000> and<00:03:04.690> I

00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:04.930 
a high risk of becoming overweight and I

00:03:04.930 --> 00:03:06.390 
a high risk of becoming overweight and I
think<00:03:05.260> it<00:03:05.590> would<00:03:05.739> make<00:03:05.920> people<00:03:06.069> at<00:03:06.250> least

00:03:06.390 --> 00:03:06.400 
think it would make people at least

00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:08.220 
think it would make people at least
think<00:03:06.670> twice<00:03:07.030> before<00:03:07.450> embarking<00:03:07.810> on

00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:08.230 
think twice before embarking on

00:03:08.230 --> 00:03:09.090 
think twice before embarking on
something<00:03:08.500> like<00:03:08.799> that

00:03:09.090 --> 00:03:09.100 
something like that

00:03:09.100 --> 00:03:11.460 
something like that
and<00:03:09.459> you<00:03:10.209> know<00:03:10.299> it's<00:03:10.450> when<00:03:10.540> I<00:03:10.600> see<00:03:10.900> these

00:03:11.460 --> 00:03:11.470 
and you know it's when I see these

00:03:11.470 --> 00:03:13.530 
and you know it's when I see these
patients<00:03:12.040> in<00:03:12.160> my<00:03:12.280> office<00:03:12.519> as<00:03:12.880> adults<00:03:13.209> and

00:03:13.530 --> 00:03:13.540 
patients in my office as adults and

00:03:13.540 --> 00:03:16.140 
patients in my office as adults and
there's<00:03:13.690> 30s<00:03:14.079> 40s<00:03:14.260> 50s<00:03:14.500> and<00:03:14.920> all<00:03:15.790> the<00:03:15.940> harm

00:03:16.140 --> 00:03:16.150 
there's 30s 40s 50s and all the harm

00:03:16.150 --> 00:03:17.729 
there's 30s 40s 50s and all the harm
that<00:03:16.209> hiding<00:03:16.630> causes<00:03:17.049> they<00:03:17.170> get<00:03:17.350> to<00:03:17.500> a<00:03:17.530> point

00:03:17.729 --> 00:03:17.739 
that hiding causes they get to a point

00:03:17.739 --> 00:03:20.490
