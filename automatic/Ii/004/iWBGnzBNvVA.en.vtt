may be crazy right now and I'm kind of

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:55.850 
may be crazy right now and I'm kind of
one<00:00:54.120> of<00:00:54.300> them<00:00:54.420> until<00:00:54.600> I<00:00:54.690> saw<00:00:54.870> the<00:00:54.930> product<00:00:55.410> and

00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:55.860 
one of them until I saw the product and

00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:57.950 
one of them until I saw the product and
what<00:00:55.980> I<00:00:56.040> mean<00:00:56.280> is<00:00:56.430> crazy<00:00:56.700> because<00:00:56.970> we<00:00:57.780> need

00:00:57.950 --> 00:00:57.960 
what I mean is crazy because we need

00:00:57.960 --> 00:00:59.690 
what I mean is crazy because we need
another<00:00:58.200> broad<00:00:58.530> head<00:00:58.800> in<00:00:58.980> this<00:00:59.160> business<00:00:59.400> like

00:00:59.690 --> 00:00:59.700 
another broad head in this business like

00:00:59.700 --> 00:01:02.090 
another broad head in this business like
I<00:00:59.879> think<00:00:59.940> we<00:01:00.150> needed<00:01:00.330> tax<00:01:00.690> increase<00:01:01.140> but<00:01:01.380> Terry

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:02.100 
I think we needed tax increase but Terry

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:03.680 
I think we needed tax increase but Terry
has<00:01:02.310> come<00:01:02.520> up<00:01:02.640> with<00:01:02.790> a<00:01:02.820> new<00:01:03.000> broad<00:01:03.270> head<00:01:03.480> and<00:01:03.630> I

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:03.690 
has come up with a new broad head and I

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:05.240 
has come up with a new broad head and I
mean<00:01:03.870> it's<00:01:04.020> truly<00:01:04.320> new<00:01:04.589> and<00:01:04.800> I<00:01:04.860> want<00:01:05.040> him<00:01:05.160> to

00:01:05.240 --> 00:01:05.250 
mean it's truly new and I want him to

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:07.490 
mean it's truly new and I want him to
tell<00:01:05.400> you<00:01:05.520> about<00:01:05.550> it<00:01:05.880> what<00:01:06.479> I<00:01:06.509> did<00:01:06.750> is<00:01:07.080> a<00:01:07.170> design

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:07.500 
tell you about it what I did is a design

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:09.710 
tell you about it what I did is a design
new<00:01:07.740> broad<00:01:08.009> ed<00:01:08.220> system<00:01:08.759> reason<00:01:09.240> I<00:01:09.300> call<00:01:09.479> it<00:01:09.509> a

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:09.720 
new broad ed system reason I call it a

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:12.109 
new broad ed system reason I call it a
system<00:01:10.110> design<00:01:11.009> the<00:01:11.190> solid<00:01:11.580> stainless<00:01:11.820> steel

00:01:12.109 --> 00:01:12.119 
system design the solid stainless steel

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:14.180 
system design the solid stainless steel
ferrule<00:01:12.390> I've<00:01:13.170> got<00:01:13.320> five<00:01:13.590> different<00:01:13.740> styles

00:01:14.180 --> 00:01:14.190 
ferrule I've got five different styles

00:01:14.190 --> 00:01:15.350 
ferrule I've got five different styles
of<00:01:14.250> blades<00:01:14.490> that<00:01:14.610> are<00:01:14.759> all<00:01:14.820> interchange<00:01:15.240> on

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:15.360 
of blades that are all interchange on

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:18.200 
of blades that are all interchange on
the<00:01:15.479> same<00:01:15.690> body<00:01:16.160> so<00:01:17.160> when<00:01:17.369> I<00:01:17.400> designed<00:01:17.820> it<00:01:18.000> I

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:18.210 
the same body so when I designed it I

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:19.700 
the same body so when I designed it I
figured<00:01:18.660> out<00:01:18.780> that<00:01:18.990> if<00:01:19.200> you<00:01:19.290> design<00:01:19.440> your

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:19.710 
figured out that if you design your

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:21.560 
figured out that if you design your
ferrule<00:01:20.009> to<00:01:20.070> fly<00:01:20.250> like<00:01:20.369> a<00:01:20.430> feel<00:01:20.700> point<00:01:20.970> it

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:21.570 
ferrule to fly like a feel point it

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:22.910 
ferrule to fly like a feel point it
allows<00:01:21.810> you<00:01:21.869> to<00:01:21.899> put<00:01:22.080> any<00:01:22.259> blade<00:01:22.470> style<00:01:22.770> you

00:01:22.910 --> 00:01:22.920 
allows you to put any blade style you

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:24.310 
allows you to put any blade style you
want<00:01:23.130> without<00:01:23.369> change<00:01:23.700> the<00:01:23.790> point<00:01:23.970> of<00:01:24.030> impact

00:01:24.310 --> 00:01:24.320 
want without change the point of impact

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:26.450 
want without change the point of impact
also<00:01:25.320> two<00:01:25.470> of<00:01:25.530> my<00:01:25.649> styles<00:01:26.009> you<00:01:26.100> can<00:01:26.220> shoot<00:01:26.369> them

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:26.460 
also two of my styles you can shoot them

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:28.100 
also two of my styles you can shoot them
once<00:01:26.670> to<00:01:26.790> take<00:01:26.910> the<00:01:27.060> blades<00:01:27.300> out<00:01:27.479> flip<00:01:27.960> them

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:28.110 
once to take the blades out flip them

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:29.990 
once to take the blades out flip them
over<00:01:28.229> tighten<00:01:29.040> it<00:01:29.070> up<00:01:29.220> you<00:01:29.550> got<00:01:29.700> a<00:01:29.729> brand-new

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:30.000 
over tighten it up you got a brand-new

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:32.660 
over tighten it up you got a brand-new
blade<00:01:30.270> they're<00:01:30.450> sharp<00:01:30.750> on<00:01:30.869> both<00:01:31.050> sides<00:01:31.670> pretty

00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:32.670 
blade they're sharp on both sides pretty

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:34.520 
blade they're sharp on both sides pretty
unique<00:01:32.970> deal<00:01:33.179> and<00:01:33.509> they<00:01:33.630> truly<00:01:33.929> do<00:01:34.140> fly<00:01:34.319> like<00:01:34.500> a

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:34.530 
unique deal and they truly do fly like a

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:37.190 
unique deal and they truly do fly like a
hunter<00:01:34.800> Anchor<00:01:35.130> Point<00:01:35.660> Ferro<00:01:36.660> why<00:01:36.929> is<00:01:36.990> it

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:37.200 
hunter Anchor Point Ferro why is it

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:39.169 
hunter Anchor Point Ferro why is it
shaped<00:01:37.440> like<00:01:37.679> that<00:01:37.890> it's<00:01:38.700> actually<00:01:38.970> a<00:01:39.030> couple

00:01:39.169 --> 00:01:39.179 
shaped like that it's actually a couple

00:01:39.179 --> 00:01:40.700 
shaped like that it's actually a couple
reasons<00:01:39.450> I<00:01:39.630> designed<00:01:39.960> to<00:01:40.050> feel<00:01:40.259> the<00:01:40.440> way<00:01:40.560> I<00:01:40.590> did

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:40.710 
reasons I designed to feel the way I did

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:43.790 
reasons I designed to feel the way I did
here<00:01:41.130> one<00:01:41.850> reason<00:01:42.240> is<00:01:42.450> if<00:01:42.960> you<00:01:43.020> look<00:01:43.350> how<00:01:43.590> deep

00:01:43.790 --> 00:01:43.800 
here one reason is if you look how deep

00:01:43.800 --> 00:01:45.169 
here one reason is if you look how deep
the<00:01:43.979> blood<00:01:44.190> grooves<00:01:44.459> are<00:01:44.670> when<00:01:44.819> it<00:01:44.940> gets<00:01:45.060> to

00:01:45.169 --> 00:01:45.179 
the blood grooves are when it gets to

00:01:45.179 --> 00:01:46.910 
the blood grooves are when it gets to
the<00:01:45.270> back<00:01:45.450> kind<00:01:45.750> of<00:01:45.840> ramps<00:01:46.259> up<00:01:46.410> kind<00:01:46.679> of<00:01:46.709> like<00:01:46.800> a

00:01:46.910 --> 00:01:46.920 
the back kind of ramps up kind of like a

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:48.770 
the back kind of ramps up kind of like a
snow<00:01:47.190> plow<00:01:47.429> so<00:01:48.060> when<00:01:48.209> you<00:01:48.300> shoot<00:01:48.479> an<00:01:48.600> animal

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:48.780 
snow plow so when you shoot an animal

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:50.330 
snow plow so when you shoot an animal
instead<00:01:49.289> of<00:01:49.380> just<00:01:49.500> poking<00:01:49.860> a<00:01:49.920> hole<00:01:50.069> through

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:50.340 
instead of just poking a hole through

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:52.760 
instead of just poking a hole through
and<00:01:50.520> it<00:01:50.970> actually<00:01:51.209> builds<00:01:51.959> up<00:01:52.200> pressure<00:01:52.229> like

00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:52.770 
and it actually builds up pressure like

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:54.440 
and it actually builds up pressure like
a<00:01:52.800> hydraulics<00:01:53.520> using<00:01:53.850> your<00:01:53.940> blood<00:01:54.119> and<00:01:54.330> stuff

00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:54.450 
a hydraulics using your blood and stuff

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:56.480 
a hydraulics using your blood and stuff
like<00:01:54.630> a<00:01:54.660> hydraulic<00:01:54.990> it<00:01:55.770> hits<00:01:55.920> the<00:01:56.100> back<00:01:56.280> it

00:01:56.480 --> 00:01:56.490 
like a hydraulic it hits the back it

00:01:56.490 --> 00:01:57.590 
like a hydraulic it hits the back it
doesn't<00:01:56.670> just<00:01:56.880> slide<00:01:56.970> on<00:01:57.090> the<00:01:57.330> arrow<00:01:57.450> it

00:01:57.590 --> 00:01:57.600 
doesn't just slide on the arrow it

00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:00.260 
doesn't just slide on the arrow it
actually<00:01:57.869> throws<00:01:58.080> a<00:01:58.110> spray<00:01:58.590> the<00:01:59.310> faster<00:01:59.880> the

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:12.300 
of the ramp your skin actually expands

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:14.180 
of the ramp your skin actually expands
as<00:02:12.750> your<00:02:13.020> old<00:02:13.170> goes<00:02:13.319> through<00:02:13.590> that<00:02:13.860> a<00:02:13.920> way<00:02:14.099> it

whole shot as arrow passes through so

00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:19.309 
whole shot as arrow passes through so
you<00:02:18.000> get<00:02:18.150> a<00:02:18.180> lot<00:02:18.390> quicker<00:02:18.599> blood<00:02:18.930> trail<00:02:19.200> on

lot of boneheads have big exit holes but

00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:33.110 
lot of boneheads have big exit holes but
the<00:02:31.590> entrance<00:02:32.010> hole<00:02:32.250> is<00:02:32.430> what's<00:02:32.610> blowing<00:02:32.970> my

00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:33.120 
the entrance hole is what's blowing my

me

00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:36.670 
me

00:02:36.670 --> 00:02:38.640 
me
and<00:02:37.060> I<00:02:37.120> guess<00:02:37.390> it's<00:02:37.569> because<00:02:37.689> of<00:02:38.019> that<00:02:38.140> ferrule

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:38.650 
and I guess it's because of that ferrule

00:02:38.650 --> 00:02:41.069 
and I guess it's because of that ferrule
and<00:02:38.829> that<00:02:39.189> there's<00:02:39.640> a<00:02:39.700> little<00:02:40.540> blood<00:02:40.780> grooves

00:02:41.069 --> 00:02:41.079 
and that there's a little blood grooves

00:02:41.079 --> 00:02:43.140 
and that there's a little blood grooves
on<00:02:41.290> it<00:02:41.439> so<00:02:41.650> that<00:02:42.010> this<00:02:42.280> broad<00:02:42.639> head<00:02:42.909> the

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:43.150 
on it so that this broad head the

00:02:43.150 --> 00:02:45.149 
on it so that this broad head the
ferrule<00:02:43.540> has<00:02:43.689> got<00:02:43.870> a<00:02:43.900> lifetime<00:02:44.139> warranty<00:02:44.859> on
