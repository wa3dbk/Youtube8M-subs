00:04:35.980 --> 00:04:35.990 
yeah I think other than going and

00:04:35.990 --> 00:04:37.630 
yeah I think other than going and
searching<00:04:36.380> on<00:04:36.470> the<00:04:36.560> city<00:04:36.800> for<00:04:37.070> some<00:04:37.190> parts

00:04:37.630 --> 00:04:37.640 
searching on the city for some parts

00:04:37.640 --> 00:04:39.370 
searching on the city for some parts
there's<00:04:38.390> not<00:04:38.540> much<00:04:38.720> else<00:04:38.930> we<00:04:39.020> can<00:04:39.110> do<00:04:39.350> right

00:04:39.370 --> 00:04:39.380 
there's not much else we can do right

00:04:39.380 --> 00:04:50.080 
there's not much else we can do right
now<00:04:39.590> to<00:04:41.020> think<00:04:42.020> there<00:04:42.200> isn't

00:04:50.080 --> 00:04:50.090 

00:04:50.090 --> 00:04:51.760 

yeah<00:04:50.690> I'm<00:04:50.840> pretty<00:04:50.990> sure<00:04:51.230> there's<00:04:51.410> nothing<00:04:51.530> we

00:04:51.760 --> 00:04:51.770 
yeah I'm pretty sure there's nothing we

00:04:51.770 --> 00:04:55.210 
yeah I'm pretty sure there's nothing we
can<00:04:51.919> do<00:04:52.040> right<00:04:52.190> now<00:04:52.250> so<00:04:53.620> do<00:04:54.620> it<00:04:54.710> in<00:04:54.800> next<00:04:54.949> time

00:04:55.210 --> 00:04:55.220 
can do right now so do it in next time

can do right now so do it in next time
folks<00:04:55.580> where<00:04:56.150> we<00:04:56.360> will<00:04:56.510> be<00:04:57.040> going<00:04:58.040> to<00:04:58.250> the

00:04:58.330 --> 00:04:58.340 
folks where we will be going to the

00:04:58.340 --> 00:05:00.610 
folks where we will be going to the
first<00:04:58.550> set<00:04:58.760> of<00:04:58.820> ruins<00:04:58.970> I<00:04:59.419> think<00:05:00.020> unless<00:05:00.290> I<00:05:00.470> find

00:05:00.610 --> 00:05:00.620 
first set of ruins I think unless I find

00:05:00.620 --> 00:05:01.659 
first set of ruins I think unless I find
out<00:05:00.740> that<00:05:00.800> something<00:05:01.100> else<00:05:01.310> we<00:05:01.400> can<00:05:01.430> do<00:05:01.639> right

00:05:01.659 --> 00:05:01.669 
out that something else we can do right

00:05:01.669 --> 00:05:05.650 
out that something else we can do right
now<00:05:01.850> anyway<00:05:02.449> until<00:05:03.260> then<00:05:03.440> later
