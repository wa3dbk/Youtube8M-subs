demonstration<00:02:27.170> of<00:02:27.380> the<00:02:27.830> compost<00:02:28.370> and<00:02:28.700> dirt

00:02:29.290 --> 00:02:29.300 
demonstration of the compost and dirt

00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:41.700 
demonstration of the compost and dirt
sifter<00:02:33.880> all<00:02:34.880> this<00:02:35.060> is<00:02:35.240> now<00:02:35.390> quarter-inch<00:02:35.900> -

00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:41.710 

00:02:41.710 --> 00:02:50.590 

this<00:02:42.710> is<00:02:42.800> our<00:02:42.920> life<00:02:43.100> particle<00:02:47.590> it<00:02:48.590> is<00:02:49.480> got<00:02:50.480> the

00:02:50.590 --> 00:02:50.600 
this is our life particle it is got the

00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:53.140 
this is our life particle it is got the
quarter<00:02:50.840> inch<00:02:50.960> screen<00:02:51.260> on<00:02:51.410> it<00:02:51.530> now<00:02:51.710> we<00:02:52.150> can

00:02:53.140 --> 00:02:53.150 
quarter inch screen on it now we can

00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:54.550 
quarter inch screen on it now we can
change<00:02:53.360> that<00:02:53.600> out<00:02:53.810> for<00:02:54.170> an<00:02:54.380> eighth<00:02:54.530> inch

00:02:54.550 --> 00:02:54.560 
change that out for an eighth inch

00:02:54.560 --> 00:02:59.380 
change that out for an eighth inch
screen<00:02:55.100> and<00:02:55.990> screen<00:02:56.990> even<00:02:57.830> finer<00:02:58.370> down<00:02:59.030> to<00:02:59.150> 1/8

00:02:59.380 --> 00:02:59.390 
screen and screen even finer down to 1/8

00:02:59.390 --> 00:03:05.860 
screen and screen even finer down to 1/8
inch<00:02:59.630> -<00:03:00.640> you<00:03:01.640> basically<00:03:02.030> have<00:03:02.360> a<00:03:04.870> connecting

00:03:05.860 --> 00:03:05.870 
inch - you basically have a connecting

00:03:05.870 --> 00:03:09.220 
inch - you basically have a connecting
rod<00:03:05.900> here<00:03:07.270> geometry<00:03:08.270> of<00:03:08.300> that<00:03:08.510> is<00:03:08.780> just<00:03:08.810> such

00:03:09.220 --> 00:03:09.230 
rod here geometry of that is just such

00:03:09.230 --> 00:03:12.280 
rod here geometry of that is just such
that<00:03:09.470> when<00:03:09.590> it<00:03:09.710> rotates<00:03:10.600> move<00:03:11.600> the<00:03:11.810> tray<00:03:12.050> back

00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:12.290 
that when it rotates move the tray back

00:03:12.290 --> 00:03:15.280 
that when it rotates move the tray back
and<00:03:12.500> forth<00:03:13.600> we<00:03:14.600> have<00:03:14.630> a<00:03:14.780> slight<00:03:15.020> gear

00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:15.290 
and forth we have a slight gear

00:03:15.290 --> 00:03:17.320 
and forth we have a slight gear
reduction<00:03:15.770> I<00:03:15.950> don't<00:03:16.340> know<00:03:16.430> what<00:03:16.640> exactly<00:03:16.760> I'm

00:03:17.320 --> 00:03:17.330 
reduction I don't know what exactly I'm

00:03:17.330 --> 00:03:19.390 
reduction I don't know what exactly I'm
guessing<00:03:17.660> about<00:03:17.780> 2<00:03:18.350> to<00:03:18.500> 1<00:03:18.680> gear<00:03:18.890> reduction

00:03:19.390 --> 00:03:19.400 
guessing about 2 to 1 gear reduction

00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:22.720 
guessing about 2 to 1 gear reduction
that's<00:03:20.360> probably<00:03:20.690> about<00:03:20.840> a<00:03:21.250> two<00:03:22.250> and<00:03:22.490> a<00:03:22.550> half

00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:22.730 
that's probably about a two and a half

00:03:22.730 --> 00:03:25.120 
that's probably about a two and a half
from<00:03:22.910> the<00:03:23.060> 3<00:03:23.300> inch<00:03:23.420> diameter<00:03:23.930> and<00:03:24.110> on<00:03:25.040> the

00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:25.130 
from the 3 inch diameter and on the

00:03:25.130 --> 00:03:27.640 
from the 3 inch diameter and on the
motor<00:03:25.310> end<00:03:25.580> we're<00:03:25.760> using<00:03:25.910> about<00:03:26.209> a<00:03:26.410> inch<00:03:27.410> and<00:03:27.530> a

00:03:27.640 --> 00:03:27.650 
motor end we're using about a inch and a

00:03:27.650 --> 00:03:33.400 
motor end we're using about a inch and a
half<00:03:27.680> maybe<00:03:27.820> and<00:03:29.440> the<00:03:30.440> whole<00:03:30.590> tray<00:03:32.200> rides<00:03:33.200> back

00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:33.410 
half maybe and the whole tray rides back

00:03:33.410 --> 00:03:37.710 
half maybe and the whole tray rides back
and<00:03:33.590> forth<00:03:33.830> on<00:03:34.070> four<00:03:34.730> little<00:03:34.940> Castor's<00:03:36.190> so

00:03:37.710 --> 00:03:37.720 
and forth on four little Castor's so

00:03:37.720 --> 00:03:41.760 
and forth on four little Castor's so
that<00:03:38.720> is<00:03:39.260> the<00:03:39.740> homemade<00:03:40.480> sifter<00:03:41.480> and

00:03:41.760 --> 00:03:41.770 
that is the homemade sifter and

00:03:41.770 --> 00:03:45.310 
that is the homemade sifter and
classifier<00:03:43.000> it<00:03:44.000> works<00:03:44.180> great<00:03:44.450> thanks<00:03:45.290> for

00:03:45.310 --> 00:03:45.320 
classifier it works great thanks for

00:03:45.320 --> 00:03:47.620 
classifier it works great thanks for
watching
