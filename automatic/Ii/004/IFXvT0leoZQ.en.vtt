00:00:07.799 --> 00:00:13.889
 often at least for them on my instagram 

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:16.460
 looks and completely different as if i am 

00:00:13.889 --> 00:00:19.199
 I find something all the time somewhere I buy and 

00:00:16.460 --> 00:00:22.279
 order food then there is no i cook very 

00:00:19.199 --> 00:00:28.470
 often today we'll make sauce 

00:00:22.279 --> 00:00:30.359
 until hummus this vegetable water many salad 

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:31.949
 think it's some kind of pasta for 

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:34.710
 smearing somewhere we have it 

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:38.480
 full salad and eat it even 

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:41.340
 separate without all the sense without there 

00:00:38.480 --> 00:00:43.530
 some kind of extra side dish or 

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:47.420
 something just eat hummus as the main 

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:47.420
 the dish looks like this 

00:00:48.559 --> 00:00:55.050
 add there anything you want and 

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:58.350
 roast minced meat and mushrooms and 

00:00:55.050 --> 00:01:02.850
 different vegetables and eat sleeps and and more often 

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:05.659
 This, too, us and with onions with salty 

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:07.650
 cucumber force so sharp 

00:01:05.659 --> 00:01:10.250
 so what I want to say about 

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:12.479
 hummus is made from such 

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:14.760
 chickpeas are planted which 

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:17.820
 called not we also called 

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:20.240
 just grain holmes we have a label like well then 

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:22.710
 there is she there is but in Israel she is not 

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:26.729
 use and not on the move it is called 

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:31.530
 hummus grains and hummus lettuce 

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:34.380
 things here this is not exactly Israeli at all 

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:36.869
 This is specifically Arabian dishes but she 

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:39.799
 long ago became part of our israeli 

00:01:36.869 --> 00:01:42.570
 everyday you by everyday kitchen 

00:01:39.799 --> 00:01:44.430
 Here is the situation I will make a separate 

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:47.700
 by the way the video will tell you what 

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:49.590
 in my opinion the Israeli cuisine in them 

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:51.899
 November scouts avila or paradise 

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:53.850
 the kitchen from where that goes and somehow 

00:01:51.899 --> 00:01:56.850
 global see because you are a situation 

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:59.299
 accounts to interesting but let's move on to 

00:01:56.850 --> 00:01:59.299
 recipe 

00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:18.150
 and that's how my looks he chickpeas 

00:02:15.990 --> 00:02:20.610
 stood up to water was tortured not he already 

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:23.610
 so soft it looks like this here 

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:26.190
 half a kilo of soaked peas 

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:29.850
 and let's look at our spices I 

00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:33.390
 there add two kinds of pepper this 

00:02:29.850 --> 00:02:36.090
 the usual black pepper like this 

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:40.290
 looks so small and fragrant black 

00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:43.740
 pepper still now I could show it too 

00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:46.260
 gives more such flavor here look 

00:02:43.740 --> 00:02:48.770
 what I add there mulled wine and all 

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:56.460
 such things that it was such 

00:02:48.770 --> 00:02:58.170
 pepper scented pleasant aroma here 

00:02:56.460 --> 00:03:02.910
 see what is the difference between one and 

00:02:58.170 --> 00:03:06.270
 Of course it is desirable for others to use 

00:03:02.910 --> 00:03:07.680
 such a mesh or basket where the pepper 

00:03:06.270 --> 00:03:11.490
 I don't have this one, that's why 

00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:13.530
 boil it all together so boil it 

00:03:11.490 --> 00:03:15.660
 a very, very long time somewhere 5-6 hours 

00:03:13.530 --> 00:03:18.690
 because the road is falling apart very much 

00:03:15.660 --> 00:03:21.090
 slowly and we need exactly very very 

00:03:18.690 --> 00:03:25.740
 well wreck and of course we add 

00:03:21.090 --> 00:03:29.880
 salt like this it looks like when it 

00:03:25.740 --> 00:03:31.590
 fell stir stir now i'm 

00:03:29.880 --> 00:03:34.830

00:03:34.830 --> 00:03:41.250
 I 'm lying in the sun 

00:03:36.980 --> 00:03:43.020
 Here is such a trick Well, by the way, very 

00:03:41.250 --> 00:03:45.360
 delicious by itself so here you take 

00:03:43.020 --> 00:03:47.400
 on hand he kneads he easy to warm up and 

00:03:45.360 --> 00:03:49.160
 turn on these like so finished 

00:03:47.400 --> 00:03:51.690
 boiled potatoes actors 

00:03:49.160 --> 00:03:54.930

00:03:51.690 --> 00:03:56.850
 a salad without the same grew ottira and I 

00:03:54.930 --> 00:03:58.890
 I stretch it all here is such a window 

00:03:56.850 --> 00:04:00.810
 for potatoes because I don't like that 

00:03:58.890 --> 00:04:03.150
 classic hummus to you should be like 

00:04:00.810 --> 00:04:05.340
 mashed potatoes so fluffy soft 

00:04:03.150 --> 00:04:08.340

00:04:05.340 --> 00:04:09.690
 hinu when by the way and the matter is thanks 

00:04:08.340 --> 00:04:11.460
 I can't control it 

00:04:09.690 --> 00:04:14.250
 it turns out too shallow so i do 

00:04:11.460 --> 00:04:18.799
 it is so clear and by the way possible without 

00:04:14.250 --> 00:04:18.799
 Thinu now squeeze half a lemon there 

00:04:18.950 --> 00:04:23.970
 cinema who does not know this sesame seed 

00:04:21.480 --> 00:04:27.180
 grated such is sesame oil 

00:04:23.970 --> 00:04:28.389

 hummus grains to steal 

00:04:41.080 --> 00:04:45.189
