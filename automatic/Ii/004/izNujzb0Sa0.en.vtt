TRUCKING<00:00:05.310> is<00:00:05.399> really<00:00:05.670> the<00:00:05.819> lifeblood<00:00:06.330> of<00:00:06.630> the

TRUCKING is really the lifeblood of the

TRUCKING is really the lifeblood of the
US<00:00:07.109> economy<00:00:07.260> there's<00:00:07.830> a<00:00:07.859> great<00:00:08.040> saying<00:00:08.280> in<00:00:08.460> the

00:00:08.509 --> 00:00:08.519 
US economy there's a great saying in the

00:00:08.519 --> 00:00:10.520 
US economy there's a great saying in the
trucking<00:00:08.849> industry<00:00:08.880> if<00:00:09.599> you<00:00:09.840> bought<00:00:10.110> it<00:00:10.139> a

00:00:10.520 --> 00:00:10.530 
trucking industry if you bought it a

00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:12.470 
trucking industry if you bought it a
truck<00:00:10.799> brought<00:00:11.190> it<00:00:11.370> you<00:00:11.759> know<00:00:12.030> everything<00:00:12.360> we

00:00:12.470 --> 00:00:12.480 
truck brought it you know everything we

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:18.310 
truck brought it you know everything we
use<00:00:12.660> is<00:00:12.870> pretty<00:00:13.650> much<00:00:13.829> is<00:00:14.070> brought<00:00:14.280> by<00:00:14.459> trucks

00:00:18.310 --> 00:00:18.320 

00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:20.929 

we're<00:00:19.320> developing<00:00:19.679> the<00:00:19.769> system<00:00:20.189> to<00:00:20.550> improve

00:00:20.929 --> 00:00:20.939 
we're developing the system to improve

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:22.790 
we're developing the system to improve
safety<00:00:21.119> and<00:00:21.330> efficiency<00:00:21.689> of<00:00:21.900> trucks<00:00:22.259> by<00:00:22.590> using

00:00:22.790 --> 00:00:22.800 
safety and efficiency of trucks by using

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:25.310 
safety and efficiency of trucks by using
advanced<00:00:23.369> sensing<00:00:23.910> and<00:00:24.179> communications<00:00:24.929> you

00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:25.320 
advanced sensing and communications you

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:26.660 
advanced sensing and communications you
can<00:00:25.470> think<00:00:25.650> of<00:00:25.740> it<00:00:25.800> a<00:00:25.859> little<00:00:26.070> bit<00:00:26.189> like<00:00:26.369> cruise

00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:26.670 
can think of it a little bit like cruise

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:29.060 
can think of it a little bit like cruise
control<00:00:26.699> in<00:00:27.330> your<00:00:27.480> car<00:00:27.750> and<00:00:28.439> then<00:00:28.619> we<00:00:28.710> control

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:29.070 
control in your car and then we control

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:31.070 
control in your car and then we control
the<00:00:29.220> gas<00:00:29.400> in<00:00:29.640> the<00:00:29.730> brake<00:00:29.970> but<00:00:30.300> we<00:00:30.449> do<00:00:30.630> it<00:00:30.779> for<00:00:31.019> a

00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:31.080 
the gas in the brake but we do it for a

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:33.200 
the gas in the brake but we do it for a
pair<00:00:31.470> of<00:00:31.499> trucks<00:00:31.919> using<00:00:32.730> a<00:00:32.910> direct

pair of trucks using a direct

00:00:37.130 --> 00:00:37.140 
so as the driver of the rear truck you

trucks<00:00:40.710> we're<00:00:41.010> just<00:00:41.160> adding<00:00:41.399> to<00:00:41.670> the<00:00:41.789> ability

of the drivers on the front truck

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:48.319 
of the drivers on the front truck
there's<00:00:46.590> a<00:00:46.649> radar<00:00:46.920> sensor<00:00:47.309> looking<00:00:47.699> 800<00:00:47.940> feet

00:00:48.319 --> 00:00:48.329

there's a radar sensor looking 800 feet
down<00:00:48.539> the<00:00:48.719> road<00:00:48.750> sensing<00:00:49.620> any<00:00:49.739> obstacle<00:00:50.309> it

00:00:50.569 --> 00:00:50.579 
down the road sensing any obstacle it

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:52.130 
down the road sensing any obstacle it
detects<00:00:51.000> that<00:00:51.120> and<00:00:51.449> it<00:00:51.570> automatically

00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:52.140 
detects that and it automatically

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:55.009 
detects that and it automatically
applies<00:00:52.440> the<00:00:52.649> brakes<00:00:52.920> in<00:00:53.550> both<00:00:53.940> trucks<00:00:54.269> the

00:00:55.009 --> 00:00:55.019 
applies the brakes in both trucks the

00:00:55.019 --> 00:00:56.689 
applies the brakes in both trucks the
radar<00:00:55.320> sensor<00:00:55.680> can<00:00:55.890> see<00:00:56.100> farther<00:00:56.370> than<00:00:56.640> a

00:01:01.939 --> 00:01:01.949 
do it every time a human driver

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:03.950 
do it every time a human driver
typically<00:01:02.519> takes<00:01:02.760> one<00:01:03.059> to<00:01:03.179> two<00:01:03.329> seconds<00:01:03.809> to

can do it in about a hundredth of a
second<00:01:08.750> inside<00:01:09.750> the<00:01:09.930> truck<00:01:10.229> we<00:01:10.740> try<00:01:10.950> to<00:01:11.009> change

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:11.340 
second inside the truck we try to change

the drivers experience as little as

the drivers experience as little as
possible<00:01:13.380> we<00:01:13.979> add<00:01:14.189> you<00:01:14.490> know<00:01:14.580> a<00:01:14.610> video<00:01:14.850> display

possible we add you know a video display

possible we add you know a video display
on<00:01:15.570> the<00:01:15.659> windshield<00:01:16.080> that<00:01:16.470> shows<00:01:16.770> you<00:01:16.920> the

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:17.070 
on the windshield that shows you the

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:19.429 
on the windshield that shows you the
view<00:01:17.250> from<00:01:17.460> the<00:01:17.670> other<00:01:17.700> truck<00:01:18.150> control<00:01:19.140> to

00:01:19.429 --> 00:01:19.439 
view from the other truck control to

00:01:19.439 --> 00:01:21.620 
view from the other truck control to
engage<00:01:19.829> and<00:01:20.130> disengage<00:01:20.220> the<00:01:20.670> system<00:01:21.030> but

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:21.630 
engage and disengage the system but

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:23.060 
engage and disengage the system but
fundamentally<00:01:22.200> you're<00:01:22.350> just<00:01:22.560> driving<00:01:22.950> your

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:23.070 
fundamentally you're just driving your

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:25.370 
fundamentally you're just driving your
truck

00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:25.380 

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:27.840 

certainly<00:01:26.380> you<00:01:26.650> know<00:01:26.740> fuel<00:01:27.160> is<00:01:27.400> the<00:01:27.550> biggest

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:27.850 
certainly you know fuel is the biggest

00:01:27.850 --> 00:01:30.600 
certainly you know fuel is the biggest
expense<00:01:28.240> for<00:01:28.930> fleets<00:01:29.230> it's<00:01:29.470> about<00:01:29.650> 40%<00:01:30.370> of<00:01:30.490> the

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:30.610 
expense for fleets it's about 40% of the

00:01:30.610 --> 00:01:33.530 
expense for fleets it's about 40% of the
operating<00:01:31.030> expense<00:01:31.420> of<00:01:31.570> a<00:01:31.900> typical<00:01:32.170> fleet

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:33.540 
operating expense of a typical fleet

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:35.870 
operating expense of a typical fleet
these<00:01:34.540> trucks<00:01:34.840> typically<00:01:35.350> spend<00:01:35.650> about

00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:35.880 
these trucks typically spend about

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:41.060 
these trucks typically spend about
$100,000<00:01:36.880> a<00:01:36.940> year<00:01:37.060> on<00:01:37.510> diesel<00:01:37.750> fuel<00:01:37.870> per<00:01:38.380> truck

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:41.070 

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:43.650 

the<00:01:42.070> efficiency<00:01:42.610> comes<00:01:42.910> from<00:01:43.270> the<00:01:43.360> fact<00:01:43.570> that

00:01:43.650 --> 00:01:43.660 
the efficiency comes from the fact that

00:01:43.660 --> 00:01:45.240 
the efficiency comes from the fact that
we<00:01:43.810> can<00:01:43.990> safely<00:01:44.260> put<00:01:44.590> the<00:01:44.710> trucks<00:01:44.950> closer

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:45.250 
we can safely put the trucks closer

00:01:45.250 --> 00:01:46.830 
we can safely put the trucks closer
together<00:01:45.550> than<00:01:46.119> what's<00:01:46.330> safe<00:01:46.540> when<00:01:46.720> you're

00:01:46.830 --> 00:01:46.840 
together than what's safe when you're

00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:48.930 
together than what's safe when you're
manually<00:01:47.140> driving<00:01:47.619> and<00:01:47.800> from<00:01:48.250> air<00:01:48.400> dynamics

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:48.940 
manually driving and from air dynamics

00:01:48.940 --> 00:01:51.390 
manually driving and from air dynamics
so<00:01:49.150> reducing<00:01:49.540> wind<00:01:49.780> resistance<00:01:50.290> we<00:01:50.890> save<00:01:51.130> fuel

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:51.400 
so reducing wind resistance we save fuel

00:01:51.400 --> 00:01:59.999 
so reducing wind resistance we save fuel
for<00:01:51.640> both<00:01:51.790> trucks<00:01:58.110> we've<00:01:59.110> tested<00:01:59.350> the<00:01:59.680> system

00:01:59.999 --> 00:02:00.009 
for both trucks we've tested the system

00:02:00.009 --> 00:02:02.670
