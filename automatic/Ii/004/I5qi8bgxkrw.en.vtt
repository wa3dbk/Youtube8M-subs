is<00:01:50.399> the<00:01:50.520> arm<00:01:50.790> that<00:01:51.780> pivots<00:01:52.290> to<00:01:52.850> lock<00:01:53.850> down<00:01:54.149> your

00:01:55.569 --> 00:01:55.579 
is the arm that pivots to lock down your

okay<00:01:59.159> that's<00:01:59.399> all<00:01:59.670> this<00:02:00.000> lock<00:02:00.299> cylinder<00:02:00.750> is

00:02:00.889 --> 00:02:00.899 
okay that's all this lock cylinder is

00:02:00.899 --> 00:02:02.990 
okay that's all this lock cylinder is
doing<00:02:01.229> it's<00:02:01.380> just<00:02:01.530> pivoting<00:02:01.979> and<00:02:02.189> turning

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:03.000 
doing it's just pivoting and turning

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:05.749 
doing it's just pivoting and turning

bit<00:05:04.270> and<00:05:04.509> you<00:05:04.599> have<00:05:04.629> to<00:05:04.870> drill<00:05:05.169> them<00:05:05.349> out<00:05:05.469> and

fine<00:05:09.310> I<00:05:09.639> mean<00:05:09.699> it<00:05:10.000> makes<00:05:10.210> absolutely<00:05:10.599> no

00:05:10.649 --> 00:05:10.659
