00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:44.790 
a two-tone version I think most people

in fact I think most people are going to
go<00:01:47.939> with<00:01:48.060> a<00:01:48.149> steel<00:01:48.390> version<00:01:48.869> on<00:01:49.049> the<00:01:49.259> steel

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:52.039 
go with a steel version on the steel
bracelet<00:01:49.979> which<00:01:50.880> has<00:01:51.119> kind<00:01:51.479> of<00:01:51.570> that<00:01:51.720> black

and steel Rolex Submariner look which i

00:01:54.659 --> 00:01:56.149 
and steel Rolex Submariner look which i
think<00:01:54.720> is<00:01:54.960> which<00:01:55.320> is<00:01:55.470> very<00:01:55.649> very<00:01:55.860> appealing

00:01:56.149 --> 00:01:56.159 
think is which is very very appealing

00:01:56.159 --> 00:01:58.429 
think is which is very very appealing
and<00:01:56.909> I've<00:01:57.360> seen<00:01:57.570> those<00:01:57.689> watch<00:01:57.930> as<00:01:58.110> I<00:01:58.170> put<00:01:58.320> them

00:01:58.429 --> 00:01:58.439 
and I've seen those watch as I put them

00:01:58.439 --> 00:02:00.020 
and I've seen those watch as I put them
on<00:01:58.560> they<00:01:58.680> look<00:01:58.829> quite<00:01:58.950> nice<00:01:59.159> but<00:01:59.460> I<00:01:59.640> thought

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:00.030 
on they look quite nice but I thought

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:01.880 
on they look quite nice but I thought
what<00:02:00.240> the<00:02:00.270> hell<00:02:00.509> let's<00:02:01.110> review<00:02:01.380> the<00:02:01.500> gold<00:02:01.710> one

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:01.890 
what the hell let's review the gold one

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:03.080 
what the hell let's review the gold one
and<00:02:01.920> when<00:02:02.159> the<00:02:02.250> reasons<00:02:02.520> I<00:02:02.579> like<00:02:02.729> the<00:02:02.909> gold

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:03.090 
and when the reasons I like the gold

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:05.060 
and when the reasons I like the gold
ones<00:02:03.299> I<00:02:03.390> happen<00:02:03.689> to<00:02:03.719> like<00:02:03.899> the<00:02:04.049> look<00:02:04.229> of<00:02:04.350> gold

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:05.070 
ones I happen to like the look of gold

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:07.310 
ones I happen to like the look of gold
mixed<00:02:05.579> with<00:02:05.729> black<00:02:05.969> now<00:02:06.600> it<00:02:06.780> has<00:02:06.899> a<00:02:06.930> really

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:07.320 
mixed with black now it has a really

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:09.199 
mixed with black now it has a really
nice<00:02:07.590> rubber<00:02:08.099> strap<00:02:08.550> that<00:02:08.729> has<00:02:08.819> a<00:02:08.849> sort<00:02:09.179> of

00:02:09.199 --> 00:02:09.209 
nice rubber strap that has a sort of

00:02:09.209 --> 00:02:12.320 
nice rubber strap that has a sort of
custom<00:02:09.860> texture<00:02:10.860> as<00:02:10.950> you<00:02:11.099> can<00:02:11.220> see<00:02:11.430> here<00:02:11.730> but

00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:12.330 
custom texture as you can see here but

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:13.190 
custom texture as you can see here but
again<00:02:12.540> it<00:02:12.690> is<00:02:12.810> it

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:13.200 
again it is it

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:15.050 
again it is it
I gotta<00:02:13.560> admit<00:02:13.650> it<00:02:13.890> is<00:02:14.129> a<00:02:14.160> little<00:02:14.220> strange<00:02:14.640> I'm

00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:15.060 
I gotta admit it is a little strange I'm

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:19.400 
I gotta admit it is a little strange I'm
wearing<00:02:16.020> a<00:02:16.230> a<00:02:16.709> Cartier<00:02:17.459> watch<00:02:17.519> a<00:02:18.180> large<00:02:19.019> cardi

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:19.410 
wearing a a Cartier watch a large cardi

00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:20.990 
wearing a a Cartier watch a large cardi
watch<00:02:19.590> of<00:02:19.769> that<00:02:19.860> matter<00:02:20.069> on<00:02:20.310> a<00:02:20.370> rubber<00:02:20.760> strap

00:02:20.990 --> 00:02:21.000 
watch of that matter on a rubber strap

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:22.610 
watch of that matter on a rubber strap
but<00:02:21.120> again<00:02:21.300> this<00:02:21.420> is<00:02:21.569> not<00:02:21.599> the<00:02:21.870> only<00:02:22.019> Cartier

00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:22.620 
but again this is not the only Cartier

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:24.650 
but again this is not the only Cartier
watch<00:02:22.800> which<00:02:23.010> has<00:02:23.160> come<00:02:23.400> on<00:02:24.030> a<00:02:24.060> strap<00:02:24.420> there

00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:24.660 
watch which has come on a strap there

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:28.190 
watch which has come on a strap there
was<00:02:24.810> a<00:02:24.840> version<00:02:25.140> of<00:02:26.690> remember<00:02:27.690> the<00:02:27.810> name<00:02:27.989> of<00:02:28.019> it

00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:28.200 
was a version of remember the name of it

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:29.570 
was a version of remember the name of it
but<00:02:28.319> there's<00:02:28.470> a<00:02:28.560> logic<00:02:28.860> I<00:02:28.980> reviewed<00:02:29.370> a<00:02:29.430> couple

00:02:29.570 --> 00:02:29.580 
but there's a logic I reviewed a couple

00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:33.350 
but there's a logic I reviewed a couple
years<00:02:29.910> ago<00:02:30.060> which<00:02:30.390> was<00:02:30.599> a<00:02:30.660> kind<00:02:31.560> of<00:02:31.680> sporty<00:02:32.360> but

00:02:33.350 --> 00:02:33.360 
years ago which was a kind of sporty but

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:36.290 
years ago which was a kind of sporty but
but<00:02:33.660> nothing<00:02:33.959> like<00:02:34.110> this<00:02:34.380> now<00:02:34.700> again<00:02:35.700> the

00:02:36.290 --> 00:02:36.300 
but nothing like this now again the

00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:38.630 
but nothing like this now again the
cleave<00:02:36.660> is<00:02:36.959> a<00:02:37.260> watch<00:02:37.470> devotion<00:02:38.250> to<00:02:38.370> be<00:02:38.459> very

00:02:38.630 --> 00:02:38.640 
cleave is a watch devotion to be very

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:40.039 
cleave is a watch devotion to be very
attracted<00:02:39.180> since<00:02:39.360> it's<00:02:39.510> really<00:02:39.720> several

00:02:40.039 --> 00:02:40.049 
attracted since it's really several

00:02:40.049 --> 00:02:43.699 
attracted since it's really several
years<00:02:40.230> ago<00:02:40.530> this<00:02:41.130> was<00:02:41.989> actually<00:02:42.989> the<00:02:43.319> first

00:02:43.699 --> 00:02:43.709 
years ago this was actually the first

00:02:43.709 --> 00:02:47.330 
years ago this was actually the first
ever<00:02:44.540> watch<00:02:45.540> from<00:02:46.049> Cartier<00:02:46.680> with<00:02:46.950> sort<00:02:47.160> of<00:02:47.190> a

00:02:47.330 --> 00:02:47.340 
ever watch from Cartier with sort of a

00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:51.080 
ever watch from Cartier with sort of a
more<00:02:48.330> high<00:02:48.989> volume<00:02:49.680> compared<00:02:50.549> to<00:02:50.610> its<00:02:50.819> very

00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:51.090 
more high volume compared to its very

00:02:51.090 --> 00:02:52.640 
more high volume compared to its very
high-end<00:02:51.540> collection<00:02:51.959> of<00:02:52.079> in-house<00:02:52.410> made

00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:52.650 
high-end collection of in-house made

00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:54.500 
high-end collection of in-house made
movements<00:02:53.099> so<00:02:53.160> when<00:02:53.280> the<00:02:53.370> cleave<00:02:53.610> was

00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:54.510 
movements so when the cleave was

00:02:54.510 --> 00:02:57.589 
movements so when the cleave was
released<00:02:54.900> it<00:02:55.440> also<00:02:55.620> had<00:02:55.950> the<00:02:56.099> 1904<00:02:56.970> M<00:02:57.180> C<00:02:57.450> in

00:02:57.589 --> 00:02:57.599 
released it also had the 1904 M C in

00:02:57.599 --> 00:02:59.420 
released it also had the 1904 M C in
house<00:02:57.780> made<00:02:58.049> movement<00:02:58.500> which<00:02:58.920> of<00:02:59.069> course<00:02:59.099> is

00:02:59.420 --> 00:02:59.430 
house made movement which of course is

00:02:59.430 --> 00:03:00.800 
house made movement which of course is
the<00:02:59.549> movement<00:02:59.880> inside<00:03:00.090> of<00:03:00.209> this<00:03:00.329> watch<00:03:00.569> and

00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:00.810 
the movement inside of this watch and

00:03:00.810 --> 00:03:02.720 
the movement inside of this watch and
that's<00:03:00.930> been<00:03:01.140> a<00:03:01.170> base<00:03:01.410> movement<00:03:01.920> which<00:03:02.340> kardia

00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:02.730 
that's been a base movement which kardia

00:03:02.730 --> 00:03:04.729 
that's been a base movement which kardia
is<00:03:02.880> used<00:03:03.090> to<00:03:03.239> build<00:03:03.420> on<00:03:03.660> other<00:03:03.930> complications

00:03:04.729 --> 00:03:04.739 
is used to build on other complications

00:03:04.739 --> 00:03:07.430 
is used to build on other complications
such<00:03:05.459> as<00:03:05.489> a<00:03:05.610> chronograph<00:03:06.060> which<00:03:06.599> also<00:03:06.930> exists

00:03:07.430 --> 00:03:07.440 
such as a chronograph which also exists

00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:08.809 
such as a chronograph which also exists
in<00:03:07.500> the<00:03:07.620> clip<00:03:07.829> collection<00:03:08.010> but<00:03:08.400> not<00:03:08.489> the<00:03:08.610> diver

00:03:08.809 --> 00:03:08.819 
in the clip collection but not the diver

00:03:08.819 --> 00:03:11.180 
in the clip collection but not the diver
now<00:03:09.540> what<00:03:09.840> does<00:03:09.959> the<00:03:10.079> diver<00:03:10.380> have<00:03:10.650> over<00:03:11.069> the

00:03:11.180 --> 00:03:11.190 
now what does the diver have over the

00:03:11.190 --> 00:03:13.580 
now what does the diver have over the
normal<00:03:11.690> column<00:03:12.690> now<00:03:12.900> that's<00:03:13.079> a<00:03:13.170> really<00:03:13.470> good

00:03:13.580 --> 00:03:13.590 
normal column now that's a really good

00:03:13.590 --> 00:03:14.870 
normal column now that's a really good
question<00:03:13.829> and<00:03:14.220> something<00:03:14.310> that<00:03:14.579> I've<00:03:14.730> written

00:03:14.870 --> 00:03:14.880 
question and something that I've written

00:03:14.880 --> 00:03:16.850 
question and something that I've written
a<00:03:15.030> lot<00:03:15.180> about<00:03:15.480> in<00:03:15.720> the<00:03:15.750> written<00:03:16.319> review<00:03:16.500> that

00:03:16.850 --> 00:03:16.860 
a lot about in the written review that

00:03:16.860 --> 00:03:20.300 
a lot about in the written review that
hopefully<00:03:17.250> you<00:03:17.370> will<00:03:17.459> be<00:03:17.519> reading<00:03:17.930> now<00:03:19.310> in

00:03:20.300 --> 00:03:20.310 
hopefully you will be reading now in

00:03:20.310 --> 00:03:23.120 
hopefully you will be reading now in
some<00:03:20.970> ways<00:03:21.000> I<00:03:21.209> feel<00:03:21.630> that<00:03:21.810> the<00:03:21.930> diver<00:03:22.170> is<00:03:22.590> a

00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:23.130 
some ways I feel that the diver is a

00:03:23.130 --> 00:03:25.819 
some ways I feel that the diver is a
better<00:03:23.459> watch<00:03:23.730> I<00:03:24.090> think<00:03:24.450> that<00:03:24.630> it's<00:03:24.840> it's<00:03:25.109> it's

00:03:25.819 --> 00:03:25.829 
better watch I think that it's it's it's

00:03:25.829 --> 00:03:27.559 
better watch I think that it's it's it's
not<00:03:25.920> that<00:03:26.069> much<00:03:26.430> more<00:03:26.639> expensive<00:03:26.850> that<00:03:27.389> the

00:03:27.559 --> 00:03:27.569 
not that much more expensive that the

00:03:27.569 --> 00:03:30.530 
not that much more expensive that the
premium<00:03:28.019> is<00:03:28.170> is<00:03:28.400> justified<00:03:29.400> and<00:03:29.700> there's<00:03:30.450> a

00:03:30.530 --> 00:03:30.540 
premium is is justified and there's a

00:03:30.540 --> 00:03:32.030 
premium is is justified and there's a
couple<00:03:30.720> things<00:03:30.870> about<00:03:31.200> that<00:03:31.350> like<00:03:31.680> now<00:03:31.829> first

00:03:32.030 --> 00:03:32.040 
couple things about that like now first

00:03:37.019 --> 00:03:39.740 
have a rotating divers bezel so you can
see<00:03:37.230> it<00:03:37.470> turns<00:03:38.310> around<00:03:38.489> there<00:03:38.910> and<00:03:39.120> it's<00:03:39.540> very

nicely loomed as well you'll see some
nice<00:03:41.489> loom<00:03:41.790> shots<00:03:42.060> in<00:03:42.239> there

00:03:42.949 --> 00:03:42.959 
nice loom shots in there

00:03:42.959 --> 00:03:44.690 
nice loom shots in there
of<00:03:43.200> course<00:03:43.500> the<00:03:43.620> normal<00:03:43.889> cleave<00:03:44.340> does<00:03:44.519> not

00:03:44.690 --> 00:03:44.700 
of course the normal cleave does not

00:03:44.700 --> 00:03:46.160 
of course the normal cleave does not
have<00:03:44.910> a<00:03:44.940> rotating<00:03:45.389> divers<00:03:45.690> bezel<00:03:45.959> and<00:03:46.019> that's

one<00:03:46.319> of<00:03:46.380> the<00:03:46.470> major<00:03:46.709> major<00:03:47.010> differences<00:03:47.609> the

00:03:48.080 --> 00:03:48.090 
one of the major major differences the

00:03:48.090 --> 00:03:51.129 
one of the major major differences the
dials<00:03:48.600> are<00:03:48.840> very<00:03:49.500> similar<00:03:50.010> to<00:03:50.340> one<00:03:50.489> another

00:03:51.129 --> 00:03:51.139 
dials are very similar to one another

dials are very similar to one another
there<00:03:52.139> are<00:03:52.170> is<00:03:52.500> a<00:03:52.530> little<00:03:52.859> bit<00:03:52.950> of<00:03:53.040> extra<00:03:53.220> loom

00:03:53.539 --> 00:03:53.549 
there are is a little bit of extra loom

the subsidiary second style on the diver

00:03:55.799 --> 00:03:58.640 
the subsidiary second style on the diver
is<00:03:56.040> different<00:03:56.549> but<00:03:57.359> overall<00:03:57.750> they're<00:03:58.349> very

00:03:58.640 --> 00:03:58.650 
is different but overall they're very

00:03:58.650 --> 00:04:00.319 
is different but overall they're very
very<00:03:58.920> similar<00:03:59.250> and<00:03:59.519> if<00:03:59.760> you<00:03:59.849> look<00:04:00.030> at<00:04:00.180> them

00:04:00.319 --> 00:04:00.329 
very similar and if you look at them

00:04:00.329 --> 00:04:02.210 
very similar and if you look at them
side-by-side<00:04:00.569> you'll<00:04:01.530> tell<00:04:01.739> the<00:04:01.829> difference

00:04:02.210 --> 00:04:02.220 
side-by-side you'll tell the difference

00:04:02.220 --> 00:04:04.430 
side-by-side you'll tell the difference
but<00:04:02.400> if<00:04:03.180> you<00:04:03.359> just<00:04:03.599> saw<00:04:03.780> this<00:04:03.989> one<00:04:04.200> for<00:04:04.380> example

like very thin profile dive watches this
is<00:04:33.050> the<00:04:33.110> dive<00:04:33.290> watch<00:04:33.500> you<00:04:33.650> could<00:04:33.770> easily<00:04:33.950> wear

and it could go under a shirt sleeve
without<00:04:36.650> any<00:04:37.040> problems<00:04:37.580> now<00:04:38.210> what's

00:04:38.440 --> 00:04:38.450 
without any problems now what's

00:04:38.450 --> 00:04:41.080 
without any problems now what's
interesting<00:04:38.600> is<00:04:39.080> that<00:04:39.140> the<00:04:40.070> normal<00:04:40.670> colleague

00:04:41.080 --> 00:04:41.090 
interesting is that the normal colleague

00:04:41.090 --> 00:04:43.330 
interesting is that the normal colleague
is<00:04:41.300> only<00:04:41.540> water<00:04:41.840> resistant<00:04:42.470> to<00:04:42.590> 30<00:04:42.890> meters

00:04:43.330 --> 00:04:43.340 
is only water resistant to 30 meters

00:04:43.340 --> 00:04:45.940 
is only water resistant to 30 meters
this<00:04:43.880> one<00:04:44.120> is<00:04:44.330> 300<00:04:45.200> meters<00:04:45.320> now<00:04:45.650> you<00:04:45.710> might

00:04:45.940 --> 00:04:45.950 
this one is 300 meters now you might

00:04:45.950 --> 00:04:48.610 
this one is 300 meters now you might
want<00:04:46.130> to<00:04:46.190> think<00:04:46.400> about<00:04:46.520> how<00:04:47.150> much<00:04:47.420> bigger<00:04:47.900> this

00:04:48.610 --> 00:04:48.620 
want to think about how much bigger this

00:04:48.620 --> 00:04:51.460 
want to think about how much bigger this
is<00:04:48.920> compared<00:04:49.460> to<00:04:49.670> the<00:04:50.030> normal<00:04:50.390> clip<00:04:50.660> it's<00:04:50.900> only

00:04:51.460 --> 00:04:51.470 
is compared to the normal clip it's only

00:04:51.470 --> 00:04:53.980 
is compared to the normal clip it's only
one<00:04:51.860> millimeter<00:04:52.280> thicker<00:04:52.880> now<00:04:53.510> that<00:04:53.780> means

00:04:53.980 --> 00:04:53.990 
one millimeter thicker now that means

00:04:53.990 --> 00:04:55.720 
one millimeter thicker now that means
they've<00:04:54.260> increased<00:04:54.680> the<00:04:54.950> water<00:04:55.130> assistance

00:04:55.720 --> 00:04:55.730 
they've increased the water assistance

00:04:55.730 --> 00:04:59.320 
they've increased the water assistance
to<00:04:56.030> 300<00:04:56.810> meters<00:04:57.110> from<00:04:57.320> 30<00:04:57.950> meters<00:04:58.160> but<00:04:59.120> with

00:04:59.320 --> 00:04:59.330 
to 300 meters from 30 meters but with

00:04:59.330 --> 00:05:01.060 
to 300 meters from 30 meters but with
just<00:04:59.480> one<00:04:59.570> millimeter<00:05:00.169> and<00:05:00.320> that's<00:05:00.500> kind<00:05:00.860> of<00:05:00.950> a

00:05:01.060 --> 00:05:01.070 
just one millimeter and that's kind of a

00:05:01.070 --> 00:05:04.210 
just one millimeter and that's kind of a
big<00:05:01.280> deal<00:05:01.520> 30<00:05:02.120> meters<00:05:02.360> is<00:05:02.870> like<00:05:03.380> you<00:05:03.800> can<00:05:03.980> wash

can dive with this and there's very few

00:05:12.440 --> 00:05:14.350 
can dive with this and there's very few
people<00:05:12.710> are<00:05:13.010> going<00:05:13.130> anywhere<00:05:13.640> near<00:05:13.880> 300

00:05:14.350 --> 00:05:14.360 
people are going anywhere near 300

00:05:14.360 --> 00:05:16.630 
people are going anywhere near 300
meters<00:05:14.570> but<00:05:15.050> it<00:05:15.200> also<00:05:15.350> means<00:05:15.650> that<00:05:15.830> this<00:05:16.430> is<00:05:16.490> a

00:05:16.630 --> 00:05:16.640 
meters but it also means that this is a

00:05:16.640 --> 00:05:18.640 
meters but it also means that this is a
more<00:05:16.940> durable<00:05:17.240> timepiece<00:05:17.930> so<00:05:18.080> for<00:05:18.320> a<00:05:18.350> little

00:05:18.640 --> 00:05:18.650 
more durable timepiece so for a little

00:05:18.650 --> 00:05:21.370 
more durable timepiece so for a little
bit<00:05:18.770> of<00:05:18.860> a<00:05:18.919> premium<00:05:19.370> you<00:05:20.360> are<00:05:20.540> getting<00:05:21.020> a<00:05:21.140> watch

00:05:21.370 --> 00:05:21.380 
bit of a premium you are getting a watch

00:05:21.380 --> 00:05:23.260 
bit of a premium you are getting a watch
which<00:05:21.680> is<00:05:21.710> essentially<00:05:22.400> much<00:05:22.580> more<00:05:22.820> durable

00:05:23.260 --> 00:05:23.270 
which is essentially much more durable

00:05:23.270 --> 00:05:24.670 
which is essentially much more durable
and<00:05:23.480> that's<00:05:23.840> something<00:05:24.110> which<00:05:24.320> I<00:05:24.440> don't<00:05:24.500> think

00:05:24.670 --> 00:05:24.680 
and that's something which I don't think

00:05:24.680 --> 00:05:27.670 
and that's something which I don't think
that<00:05:25.010> you<00:05:25.130> can<00:05:25.400> sort<00:05:26.000> of<00:05:26.320> overshadow<00:05:27.320> with

00:05:27.670 --> 00:05:27.680 
that you can sort of overshadow with

00:05:27.680 --> 00:05:29.470 
that you can sort of overshadow with
with<00:05:28.040> anything<00:05:28.280> else<00:05:28.580> so<00:05:28.760> you<00:05:28.820> might<00:05:29.090> like<00:05:29.300> the

00:05:29.470 --> 00:05:29.480 
with anything else so you might like the

00:05:29.480 --> 00:05:31.810 
with anything else so you might like the
style<00:05:29.840> of<00:05:30.140> the<00:05:30.290> kaliba<00:05:30.650> but<00:05:31.190> if<00:05:31.400> you<00:05:31.640> are

00:05:31.810 --> 00:05:31.820 
style of the kaliba but if you are

00:05:31.820 --> 00:05:33.159 
style of the kaliba but if you are
someone<00:05:32.419> who's<00:05:32.570> going<00:05:32.750> to<00:05:32.810> use<00:05:32.930> it<00:05:32.960> for

00:05:33.159 --> 00:05:33.169 
someone who's going to use it for

00:05:33.169 --> 00:05:35.020 
someone who's going to use it for
anything<00:05:33.380> sporty<00:05:33.979> and<00:05:34.160> want<00:05:34.580> that<00:05:34.729> extra

00:05:35.020 --> 00:05:35.030 
anything sporty and want that extra

00:05:35.030 --> 00:05:36.880 
anything sporty and want that extra
water<00:05:35.240> resistance<00:05:35.840> I<00:05:36.020> think<00:05:36.500> you<00:05:36.620> can't

00:05:36.880 --> 00:05:36.890 
water resistance I think you can't

00:05:36.890 --> 00:05:40.360 
water resistance I think you can't
overlook<00:05:37.220> the<00:05:37.430> diving<00:05:38.390> version<00:05:39.160> again<00:05:40.160> let's

00:05:40.360 --> 00:05:40.370 
overlook the diving version again let's

00:05:40.370 --> 00:05:41.740 
overlook the diving version again let's
just<00:05:40.460> put<00:05:40.729> this<00:05:40.820> back<00:05:41.000> on<00:05:41.180> the<00:05:41.210> wrist<00:05:41.510> and<00:05:41.660> I

00:05:41.740 --> 00:05:41.750 
just put this back on the wrist and I

00:05:41.750 --> 00:05:43.950 
just put this back on the wrist and I
want<00:05:41.930> you<00:05:42.020> to<00:05:42.140> imagine<00:05:42.350> for<00:05:42.800> a<00:05:43.160> moment<00:05:43.460> this<00:05:43.580> on

00:05:43.950 --> 00:05:43.960 
want you to imagine for a moment this on

00:05:43.960 --> 00:05:46.810 
want you to imagine for a moment this on
the<00:05:44.960> metal<00:05:45.260> bracelet<00:05:45.650> and<00:05:45.890> steel<00:05:46.160> it<00:05:46.490> looks

00:05:46.810 --> 00:05:46.820 
the metal bracelet and steel it looks

00:05:46.820 --> 00:05:48.550 
the metal bracelet and steel it looks
really<00:05:47.180> really<00:05:47.210> nice

00:05:48.550 --> 00:05:48.560 
really really nice

00:05:48.560 --> 00:05:51.159 
really really nice
you<00:05:49.040> know<00:05:49.160> it's<00:05:50.120> a<00:05:50.210> good<00:05:50.390> question<00:05:50.600> is<00:05:50.960> it<00:05:51.110> a

00:05:51.159 --> 00:05:51.169 
you know it's a good question is it a

00:05:51.169 --> 00:05:54.460 
you know it's a good question is it a
competitor<00:05:51.740> of<00:05:51.910> the<00:05:52.910> Rolex<00:05:53.330> and<00:05:53.660> I<00:05:54.080> think<00:05:54.320> I

00:05:54.460 --> 00:05:54.470 
competitor of the Rolex and I think I

00:05:54.470 --> 00:05:57.370 
competitor of the Rolex and I think I
think<00:05:54.500> in<00:05:54.830> a<00:05:54.919> sense<00:05:55.130> it<00:05:55.340> is<00:05:55.870> they're<00:05:56.870> very<00:05:57.169> very

00:05:57.370 --> 00:05:57.380 
think in a sense it is they're very very

00:05:57.380 --> 00:05:59.620 
think in a sense it is they're very very
different<00:05:57.650> watches<00:05:58.340> but<00:05:58.550> I<00:05:58.790> think<00:05:59.330> the<00:05:59.450> type

00:05:59.620 --> 00:05:59.630 
different watches but I think the type

00:05:59.630 --> 00:06:01.510 
different watches but I think the type
of<00:05:59.660> person<00:06:00.169> who's<00:06:00.320> going<00:06:00.680> after<00:06:00.830> what<00:06:01.250> I<00:06:01.280> call

00:06:01.510 --> 00:06:01.520 
of person who's going after what I call

00:06:01.520 --> 00:06:04.230 
of person who's going after what I call
a<00:06:01.550> status<00:06:02.090> diver<00:06:02.360> has<00:06:02.960> only<00:06:03.200> a<00:06:03.320> couple<00:06:03.650> options

00:06:04.230 --> 00:06:04.240 
a status diver has only a couple options

00:06:04.240 --> 00:06:06.880 
a status diver has only a couple options
and<00:06:05.240> if<00:06:05.510> you're<00:06:05.630> not<00:06:05.810> if<00:06:05.990> you<00:06:06.169> want<00:06:06.500> something

00:06:06.880 --> 00:06:06.890 
and if you're not if you want something

00:06:06.890 --> 00:06:08.530 
and if you're not if you want something
else<00:06:07.100> other<00:06:07.400> than<00:06:07.610> the<00:06:07.729> Rolex<00:06:08.000> Submariner<00:06:08.330> I

00:06:08.530 --> 00:06:08.540 
else other than the Rolex Submariner I

00:06:08.540 --> 00:06:10.630 
else other than the Rolex Submariner I
think<00:06:08.870> something<00:06:09.110> like<00:06:09.200> the<00:06:09.680> Cartier<00:06:10.160> collie

00:06:10.630 --> 00:06:10.640 
think something like the Cartier collie

00:06:10.640 --> 00:06:11.980 
think something like the Cartier collie
diver<00:06:10.910> is<00:06:11.150> a<00:06:11.180> place<00:06:11.479> where<00:06:11.600> you<00:06:11.690> going<00:06:11.810> to<00:06:11.900> go

00:06:11.980 --> 00:06:11.990 
diver is a place where you going to go

00:06:11.990 --> 00:06:14.260 
diver is a place where you going to go
one<00:06:12.740> interesting<00:06:13.160> element<00:06:13.490> is<00:06:13.580> the<00:06:13.760> bezel<00:06:14.180> and

00:06:14.260 --> 00:06:14.270 
one interesting element is the bezel and

00:06:14.270 --> 00:06:16.380 
one interesting element is the bezel and
it's<00:06:14.450> slightly<00:06:14.960> angled<00:06:15.500> inwards<00:06:15.979> there

00:06:16.380 --> 00:06:16.390 
it's slightly angled inwards there

00:06:16.390 --> 00:06:19.270 
it's slightly angled inwards there
unlike<00:06:17.390> the<00:06:17.660> Rolex<00:06:18.110> it's<00:06:18.320> not<00:06:18.470> ceramic<00:06:19.100> it's

00:06:19.270 --> 00:06:19.280 
unlike the Rolex it's not ceramic it's

00:06:19.280 --> 00:06:21.969 
unlike the Rolex it's not ceramic it's
my<00:06:19.729> belief<00:06:19.910> steel<00:06:20.360> with<00:06:20.930> an<00:06:21.050> a<00:06:21.229> dlc<00:06:21.740> coating

00:06:21.969 --> 00:06:21.979 
my belief steel with an a dlc coating

00:06:21.979 --> 00:06:24.780 
my belief steel with an a dlc coating
and<00:06:22.310> that<00:06:22.370> makes<00:06:22.640> it<00:06:22.850> a<00:06:23.000> little<00:06:23.479> bit<00:06:23.750> glossy<00:06:23.990> i

00:06:24.780 --> 00:06:24.790 
and that makes it a little bit glossy i

00:06:24.790 --> 00:06:26.950 
and that makes it a little bit glossy i
think<00:06:25.790> it<00:06:25.850> has<00:06:25.970> a<00:06:26.000> nice<00:06:26.240> look<00:06:26.510> to<00:06:26.540> it<00:06:26.690> I<00:06:26.930> mean

00:06:26.950 --> 00:06:26.960 
think it has a nice look to it I mean

00:06:26.960 --> 00:06:28.420 
think it has a nice look to it I mean
it's<00:06:27.169> overall<00:06:27.500> very<00:06:27.710> attractive<00:06:28.160> watch<00:06:28.280> if

00:06:28.420 --> 00:06:28.430 
it's overall very attractive watch if

00:06:28.430 --> 00:06:29.770 
it's overall very attractive watch if
there's<00:06:28.610> anything<00:06:28.850> I<00:06:29.090> would<00:06:29.210> change<00:06:29.450> it<00:06:29.630> might

00:06:29.770 --> 00:06:29.780 
there's anything I would change it might

00:06:29.780 --> 00:06:32.080 
there's anything I would change it might
be<00:06:29.900> the<00:06:30.050> hands<00:06:30.470> I<00:06:31.280> think<00:06:31.760> that<00:06:31.910> they<00:06:32.030> could

00:06:32.080 --> 00:06:32.090 
be the hands I think that they could

00:06:32.090 --> 00:06:35.140 
be the hands I think that they could
have<00:06:32.270> been<00:06:32.390> just<00:06:32.930> a<00:06:33.050> little<00:06:33.080> bit<00:06:34.000> expanded<00:06:35.000> in

00:06:35.140 --> 00:06:35.150 
have been just a little bit expanded in

00:06:35.150 --> 00:06:37.570 
have been just a little bit expanded in
terms<00:06:35.450> of<00:06:35.630> their<00:06:35.900> a<00:06:36.050> size<00:06:36.590> they<00:06:36.919> they're

00:06:37.570 --> 00:06:37.580 
terms of their a size they they're

00:06:37.580 --> 00:06:39.370 
terms of their a size they they're
definitely<00:06:37.760> long<00:06:38.180> enough<00:06:38.570> I<00:06:38.780> just<00:06:38.840> feel<00:06:39.260> like

00:06:39.370 --> 00:06:39.380 
definitely long enough I just feel like

00:06:39.380 --> 00:06:39.970 
definitely long enough I just feel like
they<00:06:39.530> could<00:06:39.680> be<00:06:39.710> like

00:06:39.970 --> 00:06:39.980 
they could be like

00:06:39.980 --> 00:06:41.440 
they could be like
a<00:06:40.010> little<00:06:40.310> fatter<00:06:40.610> or<00:06:40.970> something<00:06:41.300> like<00:06:41.390> that

00:06:41.440 --> 00:06:41.450 
a little fatter or something like that

00:06:41.450 --> 00:06:44.080 
a little fatter or something like that
one<00:06:42.080> suggestion<00:06:42.530> I<00:06:42.770> had<00:06:42.980> for<00:06:43.310> Cartier<00:06:43.700> was<00:06:43.910> as

00:06:44.080 --> 00:06:44.090 
one suggestion I had for Cartier was as

00:06:44.090 --> 00:06:46.030 
one suggestion I had for Cartier was as
you<00:06:44.510> can<00:06:44.660> see<00:06:44.810> the<00:06:44.960> hands<00:06:45.350> especially<00:06:45.830> here

00:06:46.030 --> 00:06:46.040 
you can see the hands especially here

00:06:46.040 --> 00:06:47.680 
you can see the hands especially here
there<00:06:46.430> loomed<00:06:46.730> in<00:06:46.910> the<00:06:47.030> center<00:06:47.390> but<00:06:47.660> then

00:06:47.680 --> 00:06:47.690 
there loomed in the center but then

00:06:47.690 --> 00:06:49.600 
there loomed in the center but then
they're<00:06:48.260> basically<00:06:48.410> bordered<00:06:49.190> with<00:06:49.220> gold

00:06:49.600 --> 00:06:49.610 
they're basically bordered with gold

00:06:49.610 --> 00:06:52.240
