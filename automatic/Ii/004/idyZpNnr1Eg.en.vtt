okay<00:00:05.510> so<00:00:05.570> we're<00:00:05.750> going<00:00:05.840> to<00:00:05.900> talk<00:00:06.050> today<00:00:06.260> about

00:00:06.420 --> 00:00:06.430 
okay so we're going to talk today about

00:00:06.430 --> 00:00:08.680 
okay so we're going to talk today about
some<00:00:07.430> of<00:00:07.490> the<00:00:07.550> questions<00:00:07.940> that<00:00:08.059> we<00:00:08.240> get<00:00:08.420> at

00:00:08.680 --> 00:00:08.690 
some of the questions that we get at

00:00:08.690 --> 00:00:10.240 
some of the questions that we get at
shows<00:00:09.170> or<00:00:09.530> four<00:00:09.800> on<00:00:09.889> the<00:00:09.950> phone<00:00:10.130> with

shows or four on the phone with
customers<00:00:10.730> people<00:00:11.090> generally<00:00:11.450> asking<00:00:11.990> why

customers people generally asking why

00:00:12.980 --> 00:00:14.350 
customers people generally asking why
we're<00:00:13.160> all<00:00:13.219> cream<00:00:13.490> level<00:00:13.760> you<00:00:14.059> know<00:00:14.150> what's

00:00:14.350 --> 00:00:14.360 
we're all cream level you know what's

00:00:14.360 --> 00:00:16.270 
we're all cream level you know what's
special<00:00:14.840> and<00:00:15.650> probably<00:00:15.920> the<00:00:15.980> first<00:00:16.160> thing

00:00:16.270 --> 00:00:16.280 
special and probably the first thing

00:00:16.280 --> 00:00:18.130 
special and probably the first thing
they're<00:00:16.369> going<00:00:16.460> to<00:00:16.520> ask<00:00:16.610> is<00:00:16.940> see<00:00:17.690> you<00:00:17.780> guys<00:00:17.930> do

00:00:18.130 --> 00:00:18.140 
they're going to ask is see you guys do

00:00:18.140 --> 00:00:20.860 
they're going to ask is see you guys do
pairs<00:00:18.440> folks<00:00:18.789> what<00:00:19.789> is<00:00:19.910> it<00:00:20.090> why<00:00:20.539> do<00:00:20.600> you<00:00:20.660> do<00:00:20.840> it

00:00:20.860 --> 00:00:20.870 
pairs folks what is it why do you do it

00:00:20.870 --> 00:00:22.570 
pairs folks what is it why do you do it
and<00:00:21.500> if<00:00:21.860> it's<00:00:21.980> so<00:00:22.100> good

00:00:22.570 --> 00:00:22.580 
and if it's so good

00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:24.760 
and if it's so good
how<00:00:22.730> clever<00:00:22.910> else<00:00:23.210> doesn't<00:00:23.390> do<00:00:23.600> it<00:00:23.780> that<00:00:24.620> last

00:00:24.760 --> 00:00:24.770 
how clever else doesn't do it that last

00:00:24.770 --> 00:00:26.770 
how clever else doesn't do it that last
one<00:00:24.950> is<00:00:25.010> an<00:00:25.100> easy<00:00:25.250> one<00:00:25.460> we<00:00:26.030> have<00:00:26.120> a<00:00:26.180> patent<00:00:26.570> on

00:00:26.770 --> 00:00:26.780 
one is an easy one we have a patent on

00:00:26.780 --> 00:00:29.530 
one is an easy one we have a patent on
pairing<00:00:27.590> the<00:00:27.680> spokes<00:00:28.180> so<00:00:29.180> one<00:00:29.300> of<00:00:29.330> the<00:00:29.420> things

00:00:29.530 --> 00:00:29.540 
pairing the spokes so one of the things

00:00:29.540 --> 00:00:32.560 
pairing the spokes so one of the things
you'll<00:00:29.720> notice<00:00:29.900> on<00:00:30.710> this<00:00:31.460> wheel<00:00:31.730> is<00:00:32.029> that<00:00:32.480> this

00:00:32.560 --> 00:00:32.570 
you'll notice on this wheel is that this

00:00:32.570 --> 00:00:33.790 
you'll notice on this wheel is that this
cloaks<00:00:32.840> come<00:00:33.079> from<00:00:33.230> the<00:00:33.320> right<00:00:33.440> side<00:00:33.649> of<00:00:33.710> the

00:00:33.790 --> 00:00:33.800 
cloaks come from the right side of the

00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:35.350 
cloaks come from the right side of the
hub<00:00:33.980> and<00:00:34.219> the<00:00:34.309> left<00:00:34.520> side<00:00:34.730> of<00:00:34.850> the<00:00:34.910> hub<00:00:35.090> so

00:00:35.350 --> 00:00:35.360 
hub and the left side of the hub so

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:38.800 
hub and the left side of the hub so
these<00:00:36.200> folks<00:00:36.559> as<00:00:36.890> you<00:00:37.070> tighten<00:00:37.340> them<00:00:37.810> take

00:00:38.800 --> 00:00:38.810 
these folks as you tighten them take

00:00:38.810 --> 00:00:40.600 
these folks as you tighten them take
this<00:00:38.960> red<00:00:39.200> spoke<00:00:39.530> it's<00:00:40.130> going<00:00:40.280> to<00:00:40.340> pull<00:00:40.520> the

00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:40.610 
this red spoke it's going to pull the

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:42.550 
this red spoke it's going to pull the
rim<00:00:40.760> to<00:00:40.880> the<00:00:40.970> right<00:00:41.180> if<00:00:41.900> you<00:00:41.990> take<00:00:42.200> this<00:00:42.320> less

00:00:42.550 --> 00:00:42.560 
rim to the right if you take this less

00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:43.870 
rim to the right if you take this less
boat<00:00:42.829> it's<00:00:43.040> going<00:00:43.190> to<00:00:43.250> pull<00:00:43.430> them<00:00:43.550> into<00:00:43.730> the

00:00:43.870 --> 00:00:43.880 
boat it's going to pull them into the

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:44.380 
boat it's going to pull them into the
left

00:00:44.380 --> 00:00:44.390 
left

00:00:44.390 --> 00:00:46.990 
left
so<00:00:44.930> these<00:00:45.079> spokes<00:00:45.680> are<00:00:45.829> evenly<00:00:46.250> spaced<00:00:46.670> about

00:00:46.990 --> 00:00:47.000 
so these spokes are evenly spaced about

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:48.880 
so these spokes are evenly spaced about
the<00:00:47.180> rim<00:00:47.390> the<00:00:48.050> rims<00:00:48.230> going<00:00:48.410> to<00:00:48.470> go<00:00:48.560> we're<00:00:48.770> going

00:00:48.880 --> 00:00:48.890 
the rim the rims going to go we're going

00:00:48.890 --> 00:00:52.270 
the rim the rims going to go we're going
to<00:00:48.950> go<00:00:49.010> right<00:00:49.489> and<00:00:49.760> in<00:00:50.270> left<00:00:50.570> and<00:00:50.899> right<00:00:51.320> left

00:00:52.270 --> 00:00:52.280 
to go right and in left and right left

00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:54.850 
to go right and in left and right left
kind<00:00:52.940> of<00:00:53.090> a<00:00:53.149> sneaking<00:00:53.450> pattern<00:00:54.020> as<00:00:54.800> you

00:00:54.850 --> 00:00:54.860 
kind of a sneaking pattern as you

00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:57.040 
kind of a sneaking pattern as you
increased<00:00:55.460> spoke<00:00:55.700> tension<00:00:55.910> that's<00:00:56.690> because

00:00:57.040 --> 00:00:57.050 
increased spoke tension that's because

00:00:57.050 --> 00:00:58.720 
increased spoke tension that's because
those<00:00:57.200> lateral<00:00:57.559> forces<00:00:57.890> are<00:00:58.070> pulling<00:00:58.399> the<00:00:58.520> rim

00:00:58.720 --> 00:00:58.730 
those lateral forces are pulling the rim

00:00:58.730 --> 00:01:02.380 
those lateral forces are pulling the rim
if<00:00:59.450> you<00:00:59.570> prepare<00:00:59.899> the<00:01:00.590> spokes<00:01:00.920> at<00:01:01.160> the<00:01:01.340> rim<00:01:01.579> the

00:01:02.380 --> 00:01:02.390 
if you prepare the spokes at the rim the

00:01:02.390 --> 00:01:04.509 
if you prepare the spokes at the rim the
right<00:01:02.660> force<00:01:02.960> is<00:01:03.440> counteracted<00:01:03.890> by<00:01:04.129> the<00:01:04.219> left

00:01:04.509 --> 00:01:04.519 
right force is counteracted by the left

00:01:04.519 --> 00:01:06.370 
right force is counteracted by the left
forces<00:01:04.909> so<00:01:05.329> you<00:01:05.360> can<00:01:05.570> tighten<00:01:05.750> the<00:01:05.930> rice<00:01:06.079> book

00:01:06.370 --> 00:01:06.380 
forces so you can tighten the rice book

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:08.260 
forces so you can tighten the rice book
in<00:01:06.890> the<00:01:07.009> West<00:01:07.189> boat<00:01:07.430> depending<00:01:07.969> the<00:01:08.090> same

00:01:08.260 --> 00:01:08.270 
in the West boat depending the same

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:10.539 
in the West boat depending the same
amount<00:01:08.570> the<00:01:09.110> rims<00:01:09.320> staying<00:01:10.010> dead<00:01:10.190> straight

00:01:10.539 --> 00:01:10.549 
amount the rims staying dead straight

00:01:10.549 --> 00:01:13.060 
amount the rims staying dead straight
that's<00:01:11.090> the<00:01:11.299> real<00:01:11.450> benefit<00:01:11.930> to<00:01:12.409> pairing<00:01:12.979> the

00:01:13.060 --> 00:01:13.070 
that's the real benefit to pairing the

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:16.390 
that's the real benefit to pairing the
spokes<00:01:13.370> of<00:01:13.490> the<00:01:13.549> rim<00:01:15.130> typically<00:01:16.130> if<00:01:16.250> you've

00:01:16.390 --> 00:01:16.400 
spokes of the rim typically if you've

00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:19.539 
spokes of the rim typically if you've
got<00:01:16.610> a<00:01:17.140> you<00:01:18.140> know<00:01:18.200> say<00:01:18.380> this<00:01:18.500> exact<00:01:18.770> same<00:01:18.979> take

00:01:19.539 --> 00:01:19.549 
got a you know say this exact same take

00:01:19.549 --> 00:01:21.219 
got a you know say this exact same take
this<00:01:19.670> exact<00:01:19.909> same<00:01:20.060> rhythm<00:01:20.270> you<00:01:20.869> want<00:01:21.020> to<00:01:21.080> blow

00:01:21.219 --> 00:01:21.229 
this exact same rhythm you want to blow

00:01:21.229 --> 00:01:23.760 
this exact same rhythm you want to blow
the<00:01:21.290> 16<00:01:21.740> spoons<00:01:22.100> but<00:01:22.790> you<00:01:22.880> space<00:01:23.150> them<00:01:23.180> evenly

00:01:23.760 --> 00:01:23.770 
the 16 spoons but you space them evenly

00:01:23.770 --> 00:01:26.890 
the 16 spoons but you space them evenly
as<00:01:24.770> you<00:01:24.830> bring<00:01:25.280> spoke<00:01:25.549> tension<00:01:25.760> up<00:01:26.119> you're

00:01:26.890 --> 00:01:26.900 
as you bring spoke tension up you're

00:01:26.900 --> 00:01:28.660 
as you bring spoke tension up you're
going<00:01:26.990> to<00:01:27.049> have<00:01:27.110> that<00:01:27.350> that<00:01:27.830> issue<00:01:28.250> with<00:01:28.549> the

00:01:28.660 --> 00:01:28.670 
going to have that that issue with the

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:29.890 
going to have that that issue with the
spoke<00:01:28.909> so<00:01:29.030> it's<00:01:29.119> going<00:01:29.210> to<00:01:29.299> pull<00:01:29.420> right<00:01:29.450> then

00:01:29.890 --> 00:01:29.900 
spoke so it's going to pull right then

00:01:29.900 --> 00:01:32.260 
spoke so it's going to pull right then
left<00:01:30.080> and<00:01:30.290> right<00:01:30.470> the<00:01:30.560> left<00:01:30.740> does<00:01:31.070> this<00:01:31.280> so

00:01:32.260 --> 00:01:32.270 
left and right the left does this so

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:35.289 
left and right the left does this so
what<00:01:32.420> do<00:01:32.479> you<00:01:32.570> do<00:01:33.460> some<00:01:34.460> manufacturers<00:01:35.060> bring

00:01:35.289 --> 00:01:35.299 
what do you do some manufacturers bring

00:01:35.299 --> 00:01:37.240 
what do you do some manufacturers bring
spoke<00:01:35.570> tension<00:01:35.810> down<00:01:36.170> if<00:01:36.740> you<00:01:36.799> bring<00:01:36.950> spoke

00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:37.250 
spoke tension down if you bring spoke

00:01:37.250 --> 00:01:39.760 
spoke tension down if you bring spoke
tension<00:01:37.460> down<00:01:38.110> well<00:01:39.110> then<00:01:39.200> it<00:01:39.350> doesn't<00:01:39.619> pull

00:01:39.760 --> 00:01:39.770 
tension down well then it doesn't pull

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:43.120 
tension down well then it doesn't pull
so<00:01:39.950> hard<00:01:39.979> left<00:01:40.520> or<00:01:40.700> right<00:01:40.880> so<00:01:41.710> essentially<00:01:42.710> you

00:01:43.120 --> 00:01:43.130 
so hard left or right so essentially you

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:45.039 
so hard left or right so essentially you
can<00:01:43.250> get<00:01:43.430> rid<00:01:43.580> of<00:01:43.640> the<00:01:43.760> problem<00:01:44.060> that<00:01:44.090> way<00:01:44.360> but

00:01:45.039 --> 00:01:45.049 
can get rid of the problem that way but

00:01:45.049 --> 00:01:46.240 
can get rid of the problem that way but
then<00:01:45.170> the<00:01:45.260> wheels<00:01:45.439> kind<00:01:45.619> of<00:01:45.680> spongy<00:01:46.130> it

00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:46.250 
then the wheels kind of spongy it

00:01:46.250 --> 00:01:48.249 
then the wheels kind of spongy it
doesn't<00:01:46.610> feel<00:01:46.850> real<00:01:47.570> snappy<00:01:47.930> when<00:01:48.170> you're

00:01:48.249 --> 00:01:48.259 
doesn't feel real snappy when you're

00:01:48.259 --> 00:01:50.109 
doesn't feel real snappy when you're
coming<00:01:48.500> up<00:01:48.590> a<00:01:48.650> corner<00:01:49.040> or<00:01:49.369> when<00:01:49.580> you<00:01:49.640> stand<00:01:49.909> up

00:01:50.109 --> 00:01:50.119 
coming up a corner or when you stand up

00:01:50.119 --> 00:01:52.270 
coming up a corner or when you stand up
to<00:01:50.330> it's<00:01:50.720> a<00:01:50.780> pedal<00:01:50.990> hard<00:01:51.259> up<00:01:51.380> a<00:01:51.439> hill<00:01:51.619> or<00:01:51.770> spring

00:01:52.270 --> 00:01:52.280 
to it's a pedal hard up a hill or spring

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:56.260 
to it's a pedal hard up a hill or spring
you<00:01:53.270> could<00:01:53.689> also<00:01:53.810> have<00:01:54.049> more<00:01:54.290> spokes<00:01:54.640> and<00:01:55.640> some

00:01:56.260 --> 00:01:56.270 
you could also have more spokes and some

00:01:56.270 --> 00:01:58.390 
you could also have more spokes and some
people<00:01:56.570> do<00:01:56.689> that<00:01:56.869> and<00:01:57.140> what<00:01:57.920> that<00:01:57.950> does<00:01:58.189> is<00:01:58.340> the

00:01:58.390 --> 00:01:58.400 
people do that and what that does is the

00:01:58.400 --> 00:01:59.920 
people do that and what that does is the
best<00:01:58.580> is<00:01:58.729> more<00:01:58.880> weight<00:01:59.119> and<00:01:59.360> it's<00:01:59.750> less

00:01:59.920 --> 00:01:59.930 
best is more weight and it's less

00:01:59.930 --> 00:02:00.719 
best is more weight and it's less
aerodynamic

00:02:00.719 --> 00:02:00.729 
aerodynamic

00:02:00.729 --> 00:02:02.530 
aerodynamic
the<00:02:01.729> other<00:02:01.850> thing<00:02:02.000> to<00:02:02.090> do<00:02:02.180> is<00:02:02.270> make<00:02:02.420> the

00:02:02.530 --> 00:02:02.540 
the other thing to do is make the

00:02:02.540 --> 00:02:03.999 
the other thing to do is make the
revving<00:02:02.840> heavier<00:02:03.170> if<00:02:03.530> you<00:02:03.650> make<00:02:03.770> the<00:02:03.890> rim

00:02:03.999 --> 00:02:04.009 
revving heavier if you make the rim

00:02:04.009 --> 00:02:06.550 
revving heavier if you make the rim
heavier<00:02:04.460> of<00:02:04.640> this<00:02:04.790> dipper<00:02:05.229> it'll<00:02:06.229> resist

00:02:06.550 --> 00:02:06.560 
heavier of this dipper it'll resist

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:10.210

these<00:02:06.740> sideways<00:02:07.549> pulls<00:02:08.000> a<00:02:08.329> little<00:02:08.569> better<00:02:09.220> but

00:02:10.210 --> 00:02:10.220 
these sideways pulls a little better but

00:02:10.220 --> 00:02:10.960 
these sideways pulls a little better but
the<00:02:10.280> nice<00:02:10.399> thing<00:02:10.519> about<00:02:10.549> repairing<00:02:10.849> the

00:02:10.960 --> 00:02:10.970 
the nice thing about repairing the

00:02:10.970 --> 00:02:12.550 
the nice thing about repairing the
spokes<00:02:11.269> is<00:02:11.599> that<00:02:11.720> we<00:02:11.810> don't<00:02:11.959> have<00:02:12.110> to<00:02:12.230> do<00:02:12.379> that

00:02:12.550 --> 00:02:12.560 
spokes is that we don't have to do that

00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:15.040 
spokes is that we don't have to do that
we<00:02:12.709> pretty<00:02:12.950> much<00:02:13.040> can<00:02:13.400> take<00:02:13.720> that<00:02:14.720> essentially

00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:15.050 
we pretty much can take that essentially

00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:17.350 
we pretty much can take that essentially
almost<00:02:15.200> any<00:02:15.440> rim<00:02:15.770> and<00:02:16.670> we<00:02:16.849> can<00:02:17.000> choose<00:02:17.239> the

00:02:17.350 --> 00:02:17.360 
almost any rim and we can choose the

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:18.270 
almost any rim and we can choose the
number<00:02:17.450> suppose

00:02:18.270 --> 00:02:18.280 
number suppose

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:20.550 
number suppose
we<00:02:18.340> can<00:02:18.490> set<00:02:18.670> the<00:02:18.760> spoke<00:02:19.030> tension<00:02:19.319> we<00:02:20.319> can<00:02:20.440> get

00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:20.560 
we can set the spoke tension we can get

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:22.380 
we can set the spoke tension we can get
the<00:02:20.650> spokes<00:02:20.980> to<00:02:21.069> be<00:02:21.220> exactly<00:02:21.970> in<00:02:22.060> the<00:02:22.150> sweet

00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:22.390 
the spokes to be exactly in the sweet

00:02:22.390 --> 00:02:24.540 
the spokes to be exactly in the sweet
spot<00:02:22.510> for<00:02:22.690> tension<00:02:23.410> because<00:02:23.709> each<00:02:23.980> spoke<00:02:24.220> does

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:24.550 
spot for tension because each spoke does

00:02:24.550 --> 00:02:27.330 
spot for tension because each spoke does
have<00:02:24.850> a<00:02:25.209> specific<00:02:25.930> tension<00:02:26.350> range<00:02:26.590> that

00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:27.340 
have a specific tension range that

00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:29.580 
have a specific tension range that
wishes<00:02:27.670> it<00:02:28.060> makes<00:02:28.330> the<00:02:28.420> wheel<00:02:28.569> -<00:02:28.720> stiffness<00:02:29.140> if

00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:29.590 
wishes it makes the wheel - stiffness if

00:02:29.590 --> 00:02:31.110 
wishes it makes the wheel - stiffness if
you<00:02:29.680> don't<00:02:29.830> tighten<00:02:30.010> it<00:02:30.130> enough<00:02:30.400> the<00:02:30.819> wheels

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:31.120 
you don't tighten it enough the wheels

00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:33.030 
you don't tighten it enough the wheels
pretty<00:02:31.450> soft<00:02:31.660> and<00:02:31.900> spongy<00:02:32.110> if<00:02:32.620> you<00:02:32.709> take<00:02:32.890> it

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:33.040 
pretty soft and spongy if you take it

00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:35.670 
pretty soft and spongy if you take it
too<00:02:33.220> much<00:02:33.459> they<00:02:34.180> actually<00:02:34.300> can<00:02:34.600> also<00:02:34.930> be<00:02:35.290> not

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:35.680 
too much they actually can also be not

00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:38.250 
too much they actually can also be not
stiff<00:02:36.010> so<00:02:36.670> the<00:02:36.819> really<00:02:37.239> specific<00:02:37.780> range<00:02:38.020> for

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:38.260 
stiff so the really specific range for

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:40.699 
stiff so the really specific range for
each<00:02:38.410> spoke<00:02:38.770> that<00:02:39.550> you<00:02:39.640> want<00:02:39.850> to<00:02:39.940> stay<00:02:40.120> within

00:02:40.699 --> 00:02:40.709 
each spoke that you want to stay within

00:02:40.709 --> 00:02:43.830 
each spoke that you want to stay within
because<00:02:41.709> we<00:02:41.980> pair<00:02:42.190> the<00:02:42.310> spokes<00:02:42.690> we<00:02:43.690> don't

00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:43.840 
because we pair the spokes we don't

00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:45.090 
because we pair the spokes we don't
really<00:02:43.930> have<00:02:44.080> to<00:02:44.170> worry<00:02:44.350> about<00:02:44.440> those<00:02:44.680> lateral

00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:45.100 
really have to worry about those lateral

00:02:45.100 --> 00:02:46.890 
really have to worry about those lateral
forces<00:02:45.400> because<00:02:45.700> they're<00:02:45.850> offset<00:02:46.030> here<00:02:46.780> in

00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:46.900 
forces because they're offset here in

00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:49.110 
forces because they're offset here in
that<00:02:47.110> ramp<00:02:47.410> so<00:02:48.400> we<00:02:48.430> can<00:02:48.550> set<00:02:48.790> the<00:02:48.880> spoke

00:02:49.110 --> 00:02:49.120 
that ramp so we can set the spoke

00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:50.880 
that ramp so we can set the spoke
tension<00:02:49.300> to<00:02:49.510> be<00:02:49.600> dead<00:02:50.020> middle<00:02:50.350> the<00:02:50.410> sweet<00:02:50.620> spot

00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:50.890 
tension to be dead middle the sweet spot

00:02:50.890 --> 00:02:52.110 
tension to be dead middle the sweet spot
which<00:02:51.040> is<00:02:51.160> pretty<00:02:51.430> much<00:02:51.550> we<00:02:51.700> do<00:02:51.850> for

00:02:52.110 --> 00:02:52.120 
which is pretty much we do for

00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:54.570 
which is pretty much we do for
everything<00:02:52.650> that's<00:02:53.650> so<00:02:53.830> that<00:02:54.100> does<00:02:54.280> a<00:02:54.310> real

00:02:54.570 --> 00:02:54.580 
everything that's so that does a real

00:02:54.580 --> 00:02:56.400 
everything that's so that does a real
advantage<00:02:55.150> that<00:02:55.600> we<00:02:55.750> have<00:02:55.780> that<00:02:56.140> everyone

00:02:56.400 --> 00:02:56.410 
advantage that we have that everyone

00:02:56.410 --> 00:02:58.890 
advantage that we have that everyone
can't<00:02:56.650> do<00:02:57.209> probably<00:02:58.209> the<00:02:58.360> big<00:02:58.570> day<00:02:58.720> you<00:02:58.750> know

00:02:58.890 --> 00:02:58.900 
can't do probably the big day you know

00:02:58.900 --> 00:02:59.970 
can't do probably the big day you know
another<00:02:59.110> advantage<00:02:59.500> it's<00:02:59.620> not<00:02:59.769> just<00:02:59.920> the

00:02:59.970 --> 00:02:59.980 
another advantage it's not just the

00:02:59.980 --> 00:03:01.620 
another advantage it's not just the
technology<00:03:00.519> the<00:03:00.610> technology<00:03:00.670> is<00:03:01.180> quite<00:03:01.390> a<00:03:01.420> bit

00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:01.630 
technology the technology is quite a bit

00:03:01.630 --> 00:03:03.420 
technology the technology is quite a bit
but<00:03:01.810> if<00:03:01.930> you<00:03:02.050> have<00:03:02.170> a<00:03:02.200> great<00:03:02.590> idea<00:03:02.860> but<00:03:03.190> you

00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:03.430 
but if you have a great idea but you

00:03:03.430 --> 00:03:04.680 
but if you have a great idea but you
don't<00:03:03.580> build<00:03:03.760> it<00:03:03.940> well<00:03:04.090> then<00:03:04.269> it<00:03:04.360> doesn't

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:04.690 
don't build it well then it doesn't

00:03:04.690 --> 00:03:07.290 
don't build it well then it doesn't
really<00:03:04.720> matter<00:03:05.610> one<00:03:06.610> of<00:03:06.700> things<00:03:06.819> we<00:03:06.970> did<00:03:07.000> we

00:03:07.290 --> 00:03:07.300 
really matter one of things we did we

00:03:07.300 --> 00:03:09.150 
really matter one of things we did we
build<00:03:07.510> 100<00:03:07.810> percent<00:03:08.380> of<00:03:08.440> our<00:03:08.590> wheels<00:03:08.769> here<00:03:08.920> in

00:03:09.150 --> 00:03:09.160 
build 100 percent of our wheels here in

00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:12.330 
build 100 percent of our wheels here in
Eugene<00:03:09.430> Oregon<00:03:09.610> so<00:03:10.680> what<00:03:11.680> that<00:03:11.769> means<00:03:12.010> for<00:03:12.160> us

00:03:12.330 --> 00:03:12.340 
Eugene Oregon so what that means for us

00:03:12.340 --> 00:03:14.610 
Eugene Oregon so what that means for us
is<00:03:12.610> not<00:03:13.150> to<00:03:13.209> say<00:03:13.450> you<00:03:13.480> can<00:03:13.810> build<00:03:14.170> a<00:03:14.260> wheel<00:03:14.380> by

00:03:14.610 --> 00:03:14.620 
is not to say you can build a wheel by
