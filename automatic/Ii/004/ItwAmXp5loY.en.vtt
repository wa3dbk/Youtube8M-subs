 Queimada Grande This island has the honor 

00:00:20.040 --> 00:00:25.349
 of being the most dangerous island on the planet 

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:27.419
 the reason for that distinction has to be 

00:00:25.349 --> 00:00:30.420
 see with some terrible and dangerous 

00:00:27.419 --> 00:00:33.629

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:49.879
 about 4000 snakes 

00:00:47.220 --> 00:00:52.769
 concretely vipers to which 

00:00:49.879 --> 00:00:54.390
 due to the proportions of the island and 

00:00:52.769 --> 00:00:57.780
 the large number of snakes that the 

00:00:54.390 --> 00:01:00.390
 they inhabit would touch about four 

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:02.909
 vipers per square meter the poison of 

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:06.390
 those snakes is lethal in few 

00:01:02.909 --> 00:01:09.659
 minutes and the island located 90 km from sao 

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:12.240
 Paul would not have time to receive 

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:14.549
 necessary medical care account 

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:16.830
 people who know this island that a 

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:17.490
 fisherman came to that island to look 

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:20.070
 silver 

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:22.979
 the next day this man was 

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:25.979
 found dead in his boat full of 

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:28.350
 blood with hundreds of bites 

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:33.119
 these snakes all over his body from 

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:35.610
 1909 up in 1920 people who lived 

00:01:33.119 --> 00:01:38.280
 on that island with the goal of building 

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:40.759
 a lighthouse that guides the ships the history 

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:43.679
 account that the last keeper of that island 

00:01:40.759 --> 00:01:45.840
 with his family died in the 

00:01:43.679 --> 00:01:48.060
 inside the lighthouse because of the 

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:50.640
 bites of these snakes the 

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:53.130
 which managed to enter the interior of 

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:55.220
 lighthouse through the windows and 

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:57.750
 doors it is believed that those snakes 

00:01:55.220 --> 00:02:00.110
 they were put there by some pirates 

00:01:57.750 --> 00:02:02.789
 to protect your gold these snakes 

00:02:00.110 --> 00:02:05.819
 have evolved throughout the 

00:02:02.789 --> 00:02:08.910
 centuries without help or intervention 

00:02:05.819 --> 00:02:11.640
 human being 11 thousand years ago when 

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:14.130
 sea levels rose is believed to be 

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:17.130
 the island was separated from the continent and 

00:02:14.130 --> 00:02:18.930
 therefore it is also believed that hundreds of 

00:02:17.130 --> 00:02:20.160
 snakes were trapped without 

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:22.680
 nothing big 

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:25.440
 which have been evolving more 

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:28.170
 lethally that the same of its kind 

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:32.160
 who inhabit the continent their poison 

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:34.980
 is around 3 or 4 times more lethal than 

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:37.320
 the one of a snake of its same species 

00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:40.320
 his evolution has gotten that sum of 

00:02:37.320 --> 00:02:43.050
 poison these snakes with only one 

00:02:40.320 --> 00:02:46.080
 bite they manage to kill practically 

00:02:43.050 --> 00:02:48.950
 instantly to any person or animal 

00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:52.050
 that they would chop a tiny island 

00:02:48.950 --> 00:02:54.150
 infected with some 4000 sharp vipers 

00:02:52.050 --> 00:02:56.790
 of golden spear there nobody would survive 

00:02:54.150 --> 00:03:00.300
 for a long time they would bite you 

00:02:56.790 --> 00:03:02.700
 and you would be the food of vipers without 

00:03:00.300 --> 00:03:05.630
 doubt are few who dare to 

00:03:02.700 --> 00:03:08.580
 visiting this island only inhabit it 

00:03:05.630 --> 00:03:11.400
 the illegal snake traffickers 

00:03:08.580 --> 00:03:13.950
 which they hunt and sell in the market 

00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:16.800
 black these snakes for a big 

00:03:13.950 --> 00:03:19.470
 sum amount of money and only members 

00:03:16.800 --> 00:03:22.200
 of the Brazilian Navy usually go once 

00:03:19.470 --> 00:03:24.780
 per year for maintenance 

00:03:22.200 --> 00:03:27.120
 lighthouse you would go a few days of vacation to 

00:03:24.780 --> 00:03:28.850
 this island sleep and asen 

00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:31.850
 between vipers 

00:03:28.850 --> 00:03:37.390
 I do not think anyone would like to be 

00:03:31.850 --> 00:03:37.390
 the snakes' meal until soon
