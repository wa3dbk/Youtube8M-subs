it<00:01:36.659> is<00:01:36.750> really<00:01:36.960> nice<00:01:37.229> because<00:01:37.470> of<00:01:37.770> the<00:01:37.890> woven

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:38.130 
it is really nice because of the woven

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:41.690 
it is really nice because of the woven
icons<00:01:38.700> which<00:01:39.299> are<00:01:39.509> really<00:01:40.110> quite<00:01:40.500> nice<00:01:40.710> but<00:01:41.369> it

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:41.700 
icons which are really quite nice but it

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:43.700 
icons which are really quite nice but it
is<00:01:42.030> kind<00:01:42.420> of<00:01:42.540> ruined<00:01:42.840> by<00:01:43.020> the<00:01:43.079> fact<00:01:43.380> that<00:01:43.500> it

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:43.710 
is kind of ruined by the fact that it

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:47.810 
is kind of ruined by the fact that it
has<00:01:44.009> very<00:01:44.460> few<00:01:44.939> icons<00:01:45.210> and<00:01:46.310> it<00:01:47.310> doesn't<00:01:47.670> have

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:47.820 
has very few icons and it doesn't have

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:49.819 
has very few icons and it doesn't have
any<00:01:48.030> other<00:01:48.270> than<00:01:48.540> just<00:01:48.750> like<00:01:48.960> the<00:01:49.140> basic<00:01:49.590> ones

00:01:49.819 --> 00:01:49.829 
any other than just like the basic ones

00:01:49.829 --> 00:01:52.940 
any other than just like the basic ones
so<00:01:50.549> you<00:01:50.610> won't<00:01:50.880> get<00:01:51.090> facebook<00:01:51.329> even<00:01:52.200> and<00:01:52.710> stuff

00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:52.950 
so you won't get facebook even and stuff

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:55.160 
so you won't get facebook even and stuff
like<00:01:53.100> that<00:01:53.159> and<00:01:53.520> that<00:01:54.270> just<00:01:54.509> kind<00:01:54.720> of<00:01:54.780> rooms<00:01:55.020> it

00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:55.170 
like that and that just kind of rooms it

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:57.380 
like that and that just kind of rooms it
because<00:01:55.500> they<00:01:55.680> look<00:01:55.890> too<00:01:56.189> out<00:01:56.369> of<00:01:56.399> place<00:01:56.520> but

00:01:57.380 --> 00:01:57.390 
because they look too out of place but

00:01:57.390 --> 00:02:01.459 
because they look too out of place but

00:04:56.670 --> 00:04:59.000 
quite a few i console and rearranged
mine<00:04:56.850> so<00:04:57.090> you<00:04:57.150> just<00:04:57.480> see<00:04:57.750> what<00:04:58.380> it<00:04:58.500> has<00:04:58.650> because

00:04:59.000 --> 00:04:59.010 
mine so you just see what it has because

00:04:59.010 --> 00:05:00.530 
mine so you just see what it has because
i<00:04:59.100> think<00:04:59.160> it's<00:04:59.430> missing<00:04:59.730> like<00:04:59.880> music<00:05:00.360> and

00:05:00.530 --> 00:05:00.540 
i think it's missing like music and

00:05:00.540 --> 00:05:04.250 
i think it's missing like music and
stuff<00:05:01.010> but<00:05:02.010> it<00:05:02.220> has<00:05:02.460> like<00:05:03.420> even<00:05:04.050> the

00:05:07.760 --> 00:05:07.770 
notifications are little labels and so

00:05:07.770 --> 00:05:11.230 
notifications are little labels and so
they<00:05:07.950> look<00:05:08.250> really<00:05:08.520> nice<00:05:08.820> so<00:05:09.480> this<00:05:09.660> is<00:05:09.690> labeled

00:05:11.230 --> 00:05:11.240
