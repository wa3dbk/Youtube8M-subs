00:01:49.649 --> 00:01:53.179 
coming gynecologist but the pap smear is
where<00:01:50.460> you<00:01:50.759> check<00:01:51.299> the<00:01:51.630> sales<00:01:52.110> of<00:01:52.439> the<00:01:52.590> cervix

00:01:53.179 --> 00:01:53.189 
where you check the sales of the cervix

00:01:53.189 --> 00:01:55.580 
where you check the sales of the cervix
ok<00:01:53.670> and<00:01:53.820> the<00:01:53.970> cervix<00:01:54.570> is<00:01:54.750> the<00:01:54.960> mouth<00:01:55.259> of<00:01:55.530> the

00:01:55.580 --> 00:01:55.590 
ok and the cervix is the mouth of the

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:59.149 
ok and the cervix is the mouth of the
uterus<00:01:56.219> so<00:01:56.850> during<00:01:57.180> a<00:01:57.500> gynecological<00:01:58.500> exam<00:01:58.829> we

uterus so during a gynecological exam we

00:01:59.159 --> 00:02:02.840 
uterus so during a gynecological exam we
can<00:01:59.310> actually<00:01:59.520> swab<00:02:00.240> or<00:02:00.719> obtain<00:02:01.200> cells<00:02:01.850> from

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:02.850 
can actually swab or obtain cells from

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:04.580 
can actually swab or obtain cells from
the<00:02:02.909> cervix<00:02:03.540> that<00:02:03.780> are<00:02:03.930> red<00:02:04.200> under<00:02:04.500> the

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:04.590 
the cervix that are red under the

the cervix that are red under the
microscope

00:02:06.010 --> 00:02:06.020 
microscope

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:09.130 
microscope
cells<00:02:06.560> can<00:02:07.159> be<00:02:07.430> normal<00:02:08.300> or<00:02:08.360> abnormal<00:02:08.479> what's

00:02:09.130 --> 00:02:09.140 
cells can be normal or abnormal what's

00:02:09.140 --> 00:02:11.559 
cells can be normal or abnormal what's
interesting<00:02:09.470> there's<00:02:09.890> a<00:02:09.950> virus<00:02:10.489> you<00:02:11.450> know

00:02:11.559 --> 00:02:11.569 
interesting there's a virus you know

00:02:11.569 --> 00:02:15.400 
interesting there's a virus you know
viruses<00:02:12.110> are<00:02:12.260> common<00:02:13.810> conditions<00:02:14.810> that<00:02:15.170> cause

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:15.410 
viruses are common conditions that cause

00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:17.770 
viruses are common conditions that cause
diseases<00:02:15.980> in<00:02:16.400> us<00:02:16.550> right<00:02:16.819> so<00:02:17.269> there's<00:02:17.450> a<00:02:17.510> virus

00:02:17.770 --> 00:02:17.780 
diseases in us right so there's a virus

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:21.040 
diseases in us right so there's a virus
called<00:02:18.110> HPV<00:02:18.800> human<00:02:19.300> papilloma<00:02:20.300> virus<00:02:20.840> and<00:02:21.019> the

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:21.050 
called HPV human papilloma virus and the

00:02:21.050 --> 00:02:24.850 
called HPV human papilloma virus and the
pap<00:02:21.709> smear<00:02:22.190> not<00:02:22.879> only<00:02:23.150> can<00:02:23.900> detect<00:02:24.260> normal

00:02:24.850 --> 00:02:24.860 
pap smear not only can detect normal

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:27.970 
pap smear not only can detect normal
cells<00:02:25.160> but<00:02:25.849> abnormal<00:02:26.629> cells<00:02:26.959> either<00:02:27.470> from<00:02:27.860> an

00:02:27.970 --> 00:02:27.980 
cells but abnormal cells either from an

00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:31.150 
cells but abnormal cells either from an
infection<00:02:28.370> or<00:02:29.049> precancerous<00:02:30.049> changes<00:02:30.349> or

00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:31.160 
infection or precancerous changes or

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:33.729 
infection or precancerous changes or
even<00:02:31.730> cancer<00:02:32.299> so<00:02:32.599> that's<00:02:32.810> the<00:02:33.049> importance<00:02:33.620> of

00:02:33.729 --> 00:02:33.739 
even cancer so that's the importance of

00:02:33.739 --> 00:02:35.289 
even cancer so that's the importance of
having<00:02:33.890> that<00:02:34.040> pap<00:02:34.370> smear<00:02:34.730> all<00:02:35.000> right<00:02:35.150> let's

00:02:35.289 --> 00:02:35.299 
having that pap smear all right let's

00:02:35.299 --> 00:02:36.880 
having that pap smear all right let's
talk<00:02:35.510> HPV<00:02:36.019> because<00:02:36.260> we've<00:02:36.379> been<00:02:36.410> hearing<00:02:36.680> for

00:03:13.830 --> 00:03:13.840 
most common one that we use because

00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:17.259 
most common one that we use because
gardasil<00:03:14.840> will<00:03:15.260> prevent<00:03:15.829> viral<00:03:16.579> types<00:03:17.000> that

gardasil will prevent viral types that
cause<00:03:17.480> cervical<00:03:17.930> cancer<00:03:18.889> but<00:03:19.430> viruses<00:03:20.030> also

00:03:20.530 --> 00:03:20.540 
cause cervical cancer but viruses also

00:03:20.540 --> 00:03:23.590 
cause cervical cancer but viruses also
cause<00:03:20.900> venereal<00:03:21.560> warts<00:03:21.769> or<00:03:22.250> tumors<00:03:23.239> that<00:03:23.420> can

00:03:23.590 --> 00:03:23.600 
cause venereal warts or tumors that can

00:03:23.600 --> 00:03:26.259
