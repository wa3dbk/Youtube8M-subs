00:00:00.079 --> 00:00:04.680
 hello everyone again circle tv 

00:00:02.399 --> 00:00:08.429
 today talk about how vk 

00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:10.530
 4502 and and talk about how to act 

00:00:08.429 --> 00:00:13.440
 at low levels when you tosses 

00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:15.900
 we got into battle 10 

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:18.210
 level against us two tens for us two 

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:20.100
 tens so there are nine pretty much 

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:22.320
 Eight and we, too, on the eight in 

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:24.390
 the very top list itself what is on it 

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:28.890
 do well first of all it's hard 

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:31.740
 tank shouts 42 4502 h and 

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:33.809
 this is a good tank can say we have 

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:36.450
 royal tiger cannon 

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:39.239
 occasionally 6 7 note 2 and 8 may be 

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:41.370
 not the best indicators but damage and 

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:44.219
 armor penetration is quite normal 400 

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:46.020
 damage 203 gold breakdown 240 breakdown 

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:46.620
 quite enough to deal with 

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:48.930
 8th 

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:51.020
 ninth level that is, dozens too 

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:53.730
 enough to fight you need gold shells 

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:55.890
 how to act in such battles 

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:57.750
 let's talk a bit about tactics 

00:00:55.890 --> 00:01:00.210
 maybe not all of course vitamin o 

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:02.910
 tactics but still it is useful to all 

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:04.769
 will be useful with 10 levels climb at all 

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:06.960
 not worth it even if its so heavy 

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:09.210
 armored car like 

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:11.070
 because for a dozen breaking through 

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:14.340
 she is purely nominally they are always everything 

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:16.590
 punches almost always and almost everyone but 

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:18.450
 it's all pretty good bottom armor 

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:19.020
 bridget cardboard but the top 

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:20.220
 bronelist 

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:22.680
 and the forehead of the tower 

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:23.910
 there are even dozens of glory 

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:26.940
 god so here them 

00:01:23.910 --> 00:01:29.010
 downright forehead brow and not worth it yet 

00:01:26.940 --> 00:01:29.760
 one rule to avoid meeting with 

00:01:29.010 --> 00:01:32.940
 dozens 

00:01:29.760 --> 00:01:35.190
 if you met the top ten straight in the forehead 

00:01:32.940 --> 00:01:37.230
 then either try to hide it so you 

00:01:35.190 --> 00:01:39.300
 don't hang or try somehow 

00:01:37.230 --> 00:01:40.290
 maneuver and live longer until you 

00:01:39.300 --> 00:01:42.150
 help allies 

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:44.700
 otherwise the chances of you will of course remain 

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:46.260
 Iâ€™ll say very little right now that 

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:48.840
 this battle results will be very, very 

00:01:46.260 --> 00:01:50.940
 not outstanding but just to be the most 

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:53.040
 plain as rude how to act 

00:01:50.940 --> 00:01:55.170
 After such a difficult situation, and 

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:56.940
 quite a few opponents could 

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:59.490
 climb that stone to shoot 

00:01:56.940 --> 00:02:03.290
 it was more convenient but I did not do it 

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:06.300
 why are there still quite a few enemies left 

00:02:03.290 --> 00:02:08.100
 t28 on the right there are also enemies if i 

00:02:06.300 --> 00:02:09.600
 I'll drive up under a rock and me can just 

00:02:08.100 --> 00:02:11.760
 shoot from both sides i don't even 

00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:12.390
 noticed I do not have time to notice me 

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:15.480
 will kill 

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:16.290
 he t-55 there still drives right Ferdinand a 

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:18.360
 if i am now 

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:20.580
 the commandments doing stuffed pasan 

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:23.160
 tomatoes that's why you should always think 

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:24.989
 before you go of course it concerns 

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:27.120
 In general, in general, any tank of any 

00:02:24.989 --> 00:02:30.209
 level but with dozens when you fall 

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:32.519
 on low level especially 6 7 such as 

00:02:30.209 --> 00:02:35.100
 Okay order in the zone here they have to 

00:02:32.519 --> 00:02:37.350
 play just be extremely careful how are you 

00:02:35.100 --> 00:02:38.660
 You can understand us six Xenu he 

00:02:37.350 --> 00:02:40.430
 generally can not on 

00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:43.340
 normal so rival more or less 

00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:44.330
 strong and they kill us just 

00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:46.790
 for a sweet soul 

00:02:44.330 --> 00:02:48.380
 release for them free water also as 

00:02:46.790 --> 00:02:49.460
 principle is not I probably for some 

00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:51.440
 t-55 

00:02:49.460 --> 00:02:53.360
 but we act as allies and 

00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:55.880
 so while sous-152 i 

00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:56.750
 distracting your enemies and let's start 

00:02:55.880 --> 00:02:59.360
 shoot them 

00:02:56.750 --> 00:03:02.420
 t28 flying ass can not so painfully 

00:02:59.360 --> 00:03:04.940
 here is t-55 aspiring minus barrel you 

00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:08.480
 case a dozen are derived from the game and 

00:03:04.940 --> 00:03:10.610
 remains t28 cornered and panthers 

00:03:08.480 --> 00:03:12.650
 who are now also killed by our allies 

00:03:10.610 --> 00:03:13.310
 in this battle did not behave quite 

00:03:12.650 --> 00:03:15.350
 not bad 

00:03:13.310 --> 00:03:17.510
 and this optics me very well so 

00:03:15.350 --> 00:03:19.520
 delighted here do not break into Bochin 

00:03:17.510 --> 00:03:22.820
 t28 and the machine but firmly 

00:03:19.520 --> 00:03:26.030
 but what cons lpt shot down the caterpillar and all 

00:03:22.820 --> 00:03:27.980
 she can not do anything but then 

00:03:26.030 --> 00:03:30.620
 Of course, the Allies immediately approach and 

00:03:27.980 --> 00:03:33.110
 help 0 0 finally gives time 

00:03:30.620 --> 00:03:35.090
 this nasty on the stand straight such 

00:03:33.110 --> 00:03:37.670
 turret at close distances on them 

00:03:35.090 --> 00:03:39.860
 water is not very why so here I am 

00:03:37.670 --> 00:03:41.600
 happens Well Well it was a pretty 

00:03:39.860 --> 00:03:43.700
 now do not fight can look 

00:03:41.600 --> 00:03:45.770
 results so how is it with a car she 

00:03:43.700 --> 00:03:48.830
 even a good fight fight would not 

00:03:45.770 --> 00:03:51.980
 outstanding but we got quite a lot 

00:03:48.830 --> 00:03:54.140
 money as you see 50 thousand silver for 

00:03:51.980 --> 00:03:55.790
 fight well with you there was a circle then you 

00:03:54.140 --> 00:03:58.720
 can see the results 

00:03:55.790 --> 00:03:58.720
 see you soon
