in<00:00:54.050> Mac<00:00:54.320> OS<00:00:54.769> 10<00:00:54.800> would<00:00:55.219> be<00:00:55.399> to<00:00:55.760> position<00:00:56.059> the

00:00:56.229 --> 00:00:56.239 
in Mac OS 10 would be to position the

00:00:56.239 --> 00:00:59.200 
in Mac OS 10 would be to position the
window<00:00:56.390> then<00:00:57.230> stretch<00:00:57.769> yeah<00:00:58.100> using<00:00:58.579> little

00:00:59.200 --> 00:00:59.210 
window then stretch yeah using little

00:00:59.210 --> 00:01:01.569 
window then stretch yeah using little
tab<00:00:59.390> down<00:00:59.539> here<00:00:59.600> and<00:01:00.170> once<00:01:01.129> you've<00:01:01.339> done<00:01:01.429> that

00:01:01.569 --> 00:01:01.579 
tab down here and once you've done that

00:01:01.579 --> 00:01:04.299 
tab down here and once you've done that
it<00:01:02.359> stays<00:01:02.719> like<00:01:02.870> that<00:01:02.929> default<00:01:03.499> permanently

00:01:04.299 --> 00:01:04.309 
it stays like that default permanently

00:01:04.309 --> 00:01:05.500 
it stays like that default permanently
basically<00:01:04.730> so<00:01:04.850> even<00:01:05.030> when<00:01:05.120> I<00:01:05.150> close<00:01:05.300> this

00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:05.510 
basically so even when I close this

00:01:05.510 --> 00:01:07.230 
basically so even when I close this
application<00:01:06.230> now<00:01:06.260> restart<00:01:06.830> the<00:01:06.890> computer

00:01:07.230 --> 00:01:07.240 
application now restart the computer

00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:09.160 
application now restart the computer
when<00:01:08.240> I<00:01:08.270> come<00:01:08.510> back<00:01:08.660> to<00:01:08.720> using<00:01:09.080> this

00:01:09.160 --> 00:01:09.170 
when I come back to using this

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:11.620 
when I come back to using this
application<00:01:09.460> or<00:01:10.460> Safari<00:01:11.030> or<00:01:11.180> whatever<00:01:11.420> it<00:01:11.540> is

00:01:11.620 --> 00:01:11.630 
application or Safari or whatever it is

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:14.230 
application or Safari or whatever it is
and<00:01:11.870> all<00:01:12.770> the<00:01:12.800> window<00:01:13.130> will<00:01:13.310> be<00:01:13.340> the<00:01:13.820> same<00:01:14.000> size

00:01:14.230 --> 00:01:14.240 
and all the window will be the same size

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:15.880 
and all the window will be the same size
which<00:01:14.480> is<00:01:14.630> good<00:01:14.840> but<00:01:15.410> you<00:01:15.590> have<00:01:15.680> to<00:01:15.770> believe

00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:15.890 
which is good but you have to believe

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:20.410 
which is good but you have to believe
every<00:01:16.250> application<00:01:16.640> and<00:01:16.970> stuff<00:01:17.300> and<00:01:19.420> really

00:01:20.410 --> 00:01:20.420 
every application and stuff and really

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:23.860 
every application and stuff and really
what<00:01:20.570> we're<00:01:20.810> cinch<00:01:21.140> comes<00:01:21.380> into<00:01:21.650> it<00:01:21.770> is<00:01:22.870> you

00:01:23.860 --> 00:01:23.870 
what we're cinch comes into it is you

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:25.690 
what we're cinch comes into it is you
have<00:01:23.960> it<00:01:24.050> running<00:01:24.200> in<00:01:24.350> your<00:01:24.890> menu<00:01:25.070> bar<00:01:25.340> you<00:01:25.550> can

00:01:25.690 --> 00:01:25.700 
have it running in your menu bar you can

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:27.190 
have it running in your menu bar you can
actually<00:01:25.850> hide<00:01:26.150> it<00:01:26.360> so<00:01:26.480> it's<00:01:26.600> not<00:01:26.720> actually<00:01:27.110> in

00:01:27.190 --> 00:01:27.200 
actually hide it so it's not actually in

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:28.690 
actually hide it so it's not actually in
the<00:01:27.230> menu<00:01:27.500> bar<00:01:27.530> because<00:01:28.190> it<00:01:28.280> doesn't<00:01:28.520> need<00:01:28.580> to

00:01:28.690 --> 00:01:28.700 
the menu bar because it doesn't need to

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:31.870 
the menu bar because it doesn't need to
be<00:01:28.790> seen<00:01:29.060> but<00:01:29.600> what<00:01:29.750> basically<00:01:30.170> since<00:01:30.440> does<00:01:30.880> is

00:01:31.870 --> 00:01:31.880 
be seen but what basically since does is

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:34.720 
be seen but what basically since does is
if<00:01:32.030> you<00:01:32.060> drag<00:01:32.840> your<00:01:33.140> window<00:01:33.530> to<00:01:34.400> the<00:01:34.490> top<00:01:34.640> of

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:40.010 
someone money

00:03:40.010 --> 00:03:42.949 
someone money
but<00:03:41.010> obviously<00:03:41.370> I<00:03:41.489> think<00:03:41.790> it's<00:03:42.569> not<00:03:42.720> like<00:03:42.870> the

00:03:42.949 --> 00:03:42.959 
but obviously I think it's not like the

00:03:42.959 --> 00:03:44.509 
but obviously I think it's not like the
most<00:03:43.079> original<00:03:43.380> application<00:03:44.190> in<00:03:44.280> the<00:03:44.370> world

00:03:44.509 --> 00:03:44.519 
most original application in the world

00:03:44.519 --> 00:03:46.009 
most original application in the world
because<00:03:44.940> obviously<00:03:45.180> we've<00:03:45.569> seen<00:03:45.720> a<00:03:45.780> lot<00:03:45.989> of

00:03:46.009 --> 00:03:46.019 
because obviously we've seen a lot of

00:03:46.019 --> 00:03:48.860 
because obviously we've seen a lot of
these<00:03:46.170> features<00:03:46.739> in<00:03:47.430> Opera<00:03:47.970> over<00:03:48.359> operating

00:03:48.860 --> 00:03:48.870 
these features in Opera over operating

00:03:48.870 --> 00:03:52.160 
these features in Opera over operating
systems<00:03:49.290> but<00:03:49.950> what<00:03:50.579> it<00:03:50.700> is<00:03:50.730> is<00:03:51.269> really<00:03:51.660> worked

00:03:52.160 --> 00:03:52.170 
systems but what it is is really worked

00:03:52.170 --> 00:03:53.990 
systems but what it is is really worked
really<00:03:52.470> well<00:03:52.590> and<00:03:52.980> it<00:03:53.100> was<00:03:53.220> exactly<00:03:53.639> how<00:03:53.819> you'd

00:03:53.990 --> 00:03:54.000 
really well and it was exactly how you'd

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:56.720 
really well and it was exactly how you'd
want<00:03:54.269> it<00:03:54.329> to<00:03:54.450> work<00:03:54.630> it's<00:03:55.380> not<00:03:55.500> buggy<00:03:55.889> at<00:03:56.400> least

00:03:56.720 --> 00:03:56.730 
want it to work it's not buggy at least

00:03:56.730 --> 00:03:58.190 
want it to work it's not buggy at least
I<00:03:56.790> haven't<00:03:56.970> found<00:03:57.180> it<00:03:57.239> to<00:03:57.329> be<00:03:57.359> buggy<00:03:57.600> and<00:03:58.019> just

00:03:58.190 --> 00:03:58.200 
I haven't found it to be buggy and just

00:03:58.200 --> 00:04:00.500 
I haven't found it to be buggy and just
works<00:03:58.350> perfectly<00:03:58.440> all<00:03:59.040> time<00:03:59.340> and<00:03:59.639> it<00:04:00.269> is<00:04:00.389> an

00:04:00.500 --> 00:04:00.510 
works perfectly all time and it is an

00:04:00.510 --> 00:04:02.180 
works perfectly all time and it is an
application<00:04:00.900> you're<00:04:01.470> gonna<00:04:01.590> be<00:04:01.739> using<00:04:01.920> I

00:04:02.180 --> 00:04:02.190 
application you're gonna be using I

00:04:02.190 --> 00:04:04.729 
application you're gonna be using I
would<00:04:02.220> say<00:04:02.670> I'm<00:04:02.819> daily<00:04:03.180> basis<00:04:03.739> constantly

00:04:04.729 --> 00:04:04.739 
would say I'm daily basis constantly

00:04:04.739 --> 00:04:06.140 
would say I'm daily basis constantly
using<00:04:05.040> it<00:04:05.130> and<00:04:05.400> if<00:04:05.819> it's<00:04:05.970> an<00:04:06.030> application

00:04:06.140 --> 00:04:06.150 
using it and if it's an application

00:04:06.150 --> 00:04:07.910 
using it and if it's an application
you're<00:04:06.510> gonna<00:04:06.600> for<00:04:06.810> a<00:04:06.870> number<00:04:07.109> of<00:04:07.230> years<00:04:07.470> it's

00:04:07.910 --> 00:04:07.920 
you're gonna for a number of years it's

00:04:07.920 --> 00:04:09.530 
you're gonna for a number of years it's
probably<00:04:08.040> gonna<00:04:08.280> be<00:04:08.340> worth<00:04:08.519> worth<00:04:09.120> or<00:04:09.299> seven

00:04:09.530 --> 00:04:09.540 
probably gonna be worth worth or seven

00:04:09.540 --> 00:04:10.910 
probably gonna be worth worth or seven
dollars<00:04:09.840> and<00:04:10.230> long<00:04:10.440> term

00:04:10.910 --> 00:04:10.920 
dollars and long term

00:04:10.920 --> 00:04:15.530 
dollars and long term
so<00:04:11.910> yeah<00:04:12.780> it's<00:04:12.959> seven<00:04:13.200> dollars<00:04:13.290> and<00:04:14.359> it<00:04:15.359> works

00:04:15.530 --> 00:04:15.540 
so yeah it's seven dollars and it works

00:04:15.540 --> 00:04:19.279 
so yeah it's seven dollars and it works
on<00:04:15.780> Mac<00:04:16.139> OS<00:04:16.530> 10<00:04:16.910> leopard<00:04:17.910> or<00:04:18.150> Snow<00:04:18.209> Leopard

on Mac OS 10 leopard or Snow Leopard

00:04:19.289 --> 00:04:20.990 
on Mac OS 10 leopard or Snow Leopard
I<00:04:19.320> don't<00:04:19.709> not<00:04:19.799> believe<00:04:19.919> it<00:04:20.190> with<00:04:20.340> some<00:04:20.519> tiger

00:04:20.990 --> 00:04:21.000 
I don't not believe it with some tiger

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:22.460 
I don't not believe it with some tiger
but<00:04:21.479> you<00:04:21.690> might<00:04:21.840> have<00:04:21.930> to<00:04:22.019> check<00:04:22.200> that<00:04:22.289> out<00:04:22.440> on

00:04:22.460 --> 00:04:22.470 
but you might have to check that out on

00:04:22.470 --> 00:04:24.800 
but you might have to check that out on
the<00:04:22.710> website<00:04:22.860> look<00:04:23.820> into<00:04:24.060> a<00:04:24.090> bit<00:04:24.300> more<00:04:24.330> detail

00:04:24.800 --> 00:04:24.810 
the website look into a bit more detail

00:04:24.810 --> 00:04:27.170 
the website look into a bit more detail
but<00:04:25.260> I<00:04:25.950> know<00:04:26.070> it<00:04:26.280> definitely<00:04:26.400> does<00:04:26.760> work<00:04:26.789> on

00:04:27.170 --> 00:04:27.180 
but I know it definitely does work on

00:04:27.180 --> 00:04:28.540 
but I know it definitely does work on
Snow<00:04:27.570> Leopard<00:04:27.630> and

00:04:28.540 --> 00:04:28.550 
Snow Leopard and

00:04:28.550 --> 00:04:30.310 
Snow Leopard and
but<00:04:28.670> because<00:04:29.000> I<00:04:29.090> use<00:04:29.210> it<00:04:29.300> on<00:04:29.450> my<00:04:29.510> both<00:04:30.050> of<00:04:30.200> my

00:04:30.310 --> 00:04:30.320 
but because I use it on my both of my

00:04:30.320 --> 00:04:33.760 
but because I use it on my both of my
own<00:04:30.500> computers<00:04:31.250> and<00:04:32.000> it's<00:04:32.660> a<00:04:32.840> really<00:04:33.530> cool

00:04:33.760 --> 00:04:33.770 
own computers and it's a really cool

00:04:33.770 --> 00:04:36.130 
own computers and it's a really cool
useful<00:04:34.220> application<00:04:34.790> but<00:04:35.510> I<00:04:35.540> would<00:04:35.720> say<00:04:35.930> is

00:04:36.130 --> 00:04:36.140 
useful application but I would say is

00:04:36.140 --> 00:04:38.110 
useful application but I would say is
I've<00:04:36.410> seen<00:04:36.620> a<00:04:36.650> few<00:04:36.830> other<00:04:36.980> applications<00:04:37.130> what

00:04:38.110 --> 00:04:38.120 
I've seen a few other applications what

00:04:38.120 --> 00:04:41.380 
I've seen a few other applications what
does<00:04:38.300> similar<00:04:38.840> job<00:04:39.530> at<00:04:39.740> resizing<00:04:40.460> windows<00:04:41.120> and

00:04:41.380 --> 00:04:41.390 
does similar job at resizing windows and

00:04:41.390 --> 00:04:44.530 
does similar job at resizing windows and
stuff<00:04:41.570> and<00:04:41.810> they<00:04:42.590> normally<00:04:42.920> use<00:04:43.100> short<00:04:43.880> key<00:04:44.120> so

00:04:44.530 --> 00:04:44.540 
stuff and they normally use short key so

00:04:44.540 --> 00:04:46.570 
stuff and they normally use short key so
he<00:04:45.020> would<00:04:45.140> use<00:04:45.290> command<00:04:45.710> and<00:04:46.040> a<00:04:46.340> number

00:04:46.570 --> 00:04:46.580 
he would use command and a number

00:04:46.580 --> 00:04:50.290 
he would use command and a number
however<00:04:47.060> and<00:04:48.640> normally<00:04:49.640> I'm<00:04:49.850> a<00:04:49.880> big<00:04:50.060> fan<00:04:50.270> of

00:04:50.290 --> 00:04:50.300 
however and normally I'm a big fan of

00:04:50.300 --> 00:04:51.670 
however and normally I'm a big fan of
short<00:04:50.600> keys<00:04:50.810> and<00:04:51.020> I<00:04:51.050> think<00:04:51.230> it's<00:04:51.380> a<00:04:51.410> lot<00:04:51.530> better

00:04:51.670 --> 00:04:51.680 
short keys and I think it's a lot better

00:04:51.680 --> 00:04:53.260 
short keys and I think it's a lot better
than<00:04:51.890> using<00:04:52.010> the<00:04:52.220> mouse<00:04:52.430> but<00:04:53.060> in<00:04:53.180> this

00:04:53.260 --> 00:04:53.270 
than using the mouse but in this

00:04:53.270 --> 00:04:55.450 
than using the mouse but in this
situation<00:04:53.570> I<00:04:54.290> just<00:04:54.590> think<00:04:54.830> using<00:04:55.070> the<00:04:55.280> mouse

00:04:55.450 --> 00:04:55.460 
situation I just think using the mouse

00:04:55.460 --> 00:04:57.790 
situation I just think using the mouse
to<00:04:55.790> control<00:04:56.210> the<00:04:56.300> windows<00:04:56.660> it's<00:04:57.110> the<00:04:57.230> best<00:04:57.650> way

00:04:57.790 --> 00:04:57.800 
to control the windows it's the best way

00:04:57.800 --> 00:04:59.770 
to control the windows it's the best way
to<00:04:57.830> do<00:04:58.100> it<00:04:58.250> so<00:04:58.460> you<00:04:59.060> got<00:04:59.180> a<00:04:59.210> great<00:04:59.480> little

00:04:59.770 --> 00:04:59.780 
to do it so you got a great little

00:04:59.780 --> 00:05:02.230 
to do it so you got a great little
application<00:05:00.590> I'd<00:05:00.860> recommend<00:05:01.550> it<00:05:01.760> and<00:05:02.030> like<00:05:02.210> I

00:05:02.230 --> 00:05:02.240 
application I'd recommend it and like I

00:05:02.240 --> 00:05:03.370 
application I'd recommend it and like I
