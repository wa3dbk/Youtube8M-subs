really wish that Lego would have made

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:55.670 
really wish that Lego would have made
them<00:00:54.360> with<00:00:54.510> their<00:00:54.690> legs<00:00:54.960> that<00:00:55.260> could<00:00:55.440> move

00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:55.680 
them with their legs that could move

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:57.439

00:00:57.439 --> 00:00:57.449 
other than other than that though I

00:00:57.449 --> 00:00:58.400 
other than other than that though I
think<00:00:57.719> they<00:00:57.809> did<00:00:57.960> a<00:00:57.989> really<00:00:58.050> good<00:00:58.350> job

00:00:58.400 --> 00:00:58.410

designing<00:00:59.039> these<00:00:59.280> creepers<00:01:00.059> I<00:01:00.270> think<00:01:00.480> they

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:00.600 
designing these creepers I think they

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:02.360
