00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:11.969
 Welcome to Tutopolis TV, today a tutorial for our Samsung fans. 

00:00:11.969 --> 00:00:16.770
 I'll show you how to fix the glass of a Samsung Galaxy S3 for a maximum of $ 20, 

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:20.740
 However, you need a lot of time and above all patience, because the repair, if you to 

00:00:20.740 --> 00:00:23.539
 first time, it can take over an hour. 

00:00:23.539 --> 00:00:30.539
 First, we turn off the Samsung, remove the back cover and get the battery out. 

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:52.670
 And we can start with the repair directly. Now we take a hair dryer and 

00:00:52.510 --> 00:00:57.050
 heat the disc to make it easier to remove. With a blunt knife 

00:00:57.050 --> 00:01:01.210
 Let's go under the glass and gradually remove the broken glass, keep repeating 

00:01:01.210 --> 00:01:06.390
 the hair dryer on it, be very careful so that you do not damage the LCD. You're welcome 

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:10.360
 Be sure to start repairing at the top because there are flex cables down below 

00:01:10.360 --> 00:01:13.360
 accidentally destroy. 

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:35.360
 So, now carefully separate the touch sensors from the glass. 

00:03:09.220 --> 00:03:12.220
 Then, when the glass is completely off, we remove the black double-sided 

00:03:13.519 --> 00:03:18.180
 Tape all around and gently clean the LCD from the whole with a plastic tool 

00:03:18.180 --> 00:03:21.180
 Glass splinters and glue residues. 

00:03:54.269 --> 00:03:58.189
 Once everything is clean, the double-sided tape comes into play. Unfortunately I still have 

00:03:58.189 --> 00:04:02.510
 No adhesive tape found that fits the S3 perfectly, so we need the 

00:04:02.510 --> 00:04:06.299
 Take adhesive tape from the iphone 3G and trim it in painstaking detail 

00:04:06.299 --> 00:04:09.299
 cut and attach. 

00:04:23.260 --> 00:04:30.260
 Then we attach adhesive strips underneath the touch sensors and attach them to them. 

00:04:40.250 --> 00:04:45.450
 It should look like this once everything is done! Then the film of the 

00:04:45.450 --> 00:04:46.550
 Remove adhesive strip. 

00:04:54.550 --> 00:04:57.550
 Now we clean the LCD again with a microfibre cloth and bring the new one 

00:04:57.890 --> 00:05:00.250
 Glass on. 

00:05:32.250 --> 00:05:36.250
 We apply light pressure on it now and heat the glass again with the hair dryer 

00:05:36.660 --> 00:05:40.300
 a good bond between glass and glue is created. 

00:05:57.300 --> 00:06:02.300
 Then install the battery and the backcouver and your Samsung looks like new. 

00:06:34.290 --> 00:06:39.290
 Yes people I hope I could help you, there are more Samsung tutorials coming soon, 

00:06:39.220 --> 00:06:42.600
