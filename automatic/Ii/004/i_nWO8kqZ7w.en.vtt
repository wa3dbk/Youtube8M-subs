00:02:21.960 --> 00:02:24.470 
centers as magnetics these point out and
identify<00:02:22.920> where<00:02:23.160> volcanic<00:02:23.760> centers<00:02:23.970> occur

00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:24.480 
identify where volcanic centers occur

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:27.230 
identify where volcanic centers occur
and<00:02:24.840> this<00:02:25.410> is<00:02:25.620> what<00:02:25.860> we<00:02:26.040> look<00:02:26.400> forward<00:02:26.730> to<00:02:27.060> go

00:02:27.230 --> 00:02:27.240 
and this is what we look forward to go

00:02:27.240 --> 00:02:32.180 
and this is what we look forward to go
and<00:02:27.450> find<00:02:27.750> gold<00:02:28.320> centers<00:02:30.350> we<00:02:31.350> use<00:02:31.620> this

00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:32.190 
and find gold centers we use this

00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:34.310 
and find gold centers we use this
geophysical<00:02:32.970> technique<00:02:33.720> along<00:02:34.140> with

00:02:34.310 --> 00:02:34.320 
geophysical technique along with

00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:37.280 
geophysical technique along with
geological<00:02:34.980> mapping<00:02:35.220> to<00:02:35.700> identify<00:02:36.240> and<00:02:36.570> focus

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:37.290 
geological mapping to identify and focus

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:40.790 
geological mapping to identify and focus
about<00:02:37.790> major<00:02:38.790> exploration<00:02:39.510> targets<00:02:39.780> we<00:02:40.680> have

00:02:40.790 --> 00:02:40.800 
about major exploration targets we have

00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:43.100 
about major exploration targets we have
identified<00:02:41.280> over<00:02:41.310> 40<00:02:41.940> and<00:02:42.480> we<00:02:42.630> believe<00:02:42.930> that

00:02:43.100 --> 00:02:43.110 
identified over 40 and we believe that

00:02:43.110 --> 00:02:45.199 
identified over 40 and we believe that
these<00:02:43.290> were<00:02:43.740> people<00:02:44.010> Kings<00:02:44.400> are<00:02:44.610> going<00:02:44.970> for

00:02:45.199 --> 00:02:45.209 
these were people Kings are going for

00:02:45.209 --> 00:02:48.230 
these were people Kings are going for
the<00:02:45.300> next<00:02:45.330> many<00:02:45.930> years
