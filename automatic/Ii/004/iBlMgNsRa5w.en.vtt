that they use for stage shows and such
to<00:00:34.590> rubberize<00:00:34.829> surfaces<00:00:35.489> so<00:00:36.270> you<00:00:36.360> can<00:00:36.480> get<00:00:36.570> it

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:36.690 
to rubberize surfaces so you can get it

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:39.680

I<00:00:39.780> just<00:00:39.960> discard<00:00:40.290> it<00:00:40.610> it's<00:00:41.610> actually<00:00:41.820> can

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:42.300 
I just discard it it's actually can

accurate on the bottom here because well

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:46.279 
accurate on the bottom here because well
you<00:00:45.000> got<00:00:45.120> to<00:00:45.210> put<00:00:45.360> something<00:00:45.660> there<00:00:45.809> so<00:00:46.170> it

00:00:46.279 --> 00:00:46.289 
you got to put something there so it

00:00:46.289 --> 00:00:48.049 
you got to put something there so it
might<00:00:46.410> as<00:00:46.530> well<00:00:46.559> be<00:00:46.800> accurate<00:00:47.219> gotten<00:00:47.789> blown

smoothen<00:01:09.990> and<00:01:10.200> etc<00:01:10.880> there<00:01:11.880> are<00:01:11.909> probably<00:01:12.600> a

00:01:13.039 --> 00:01:13.049 
smoothen and etc there are probably a

00:01:13.049 --> 00:01:17.120 
smoothen and etc there are probably a
lot<00:01:13.790> easier<00:01:14.790> ways<00:01:15.600> to<00:01:15.930> do<00:01:16.350> it<00:01:16.470> so<00:01:16.979> I<00:01:17.009> don't

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:17.130 
lot easier ways to do it so I don't

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:20.469 
lot easier ways to do it so I don't
necessarily<00:01:17.820> recommend<00:01:17.939> that<00:01:18.470> but<00:01:19.470> you<00:01:20.220> know

00:01:20.469 --> 00:01:20.479 
necessarily recommend that but you know

00:01:20.479 --> 00:01:22.310 
necessarily recommend that but you know

of them are fixed on in place some of
them<00:02:10.410> actually<00:02:10.619> just<00:02:10.950> have<00:02:11.039> little<00:02:11.129> holes<00:02:11.400> at

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:11.640 
them actually just have little holes at

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:13.080 
them actually just have little holes at
the<00:02:11.700> bottom<00:02:11.730> which<00:02:12.390> the<00:02:12.599> screw<00:02:12.780> goes

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:13.090 
the bottom which the screw goes

00:02:13.090 --> 00:02:18.509 
the bottom which the screw goes
through<00:02:13.300> so<00:02:13.569> that<00:02:13.599> pulls<00:02:14.470> double-duty<00:02:17.519> around

00:02:18.509 --> 00:02:18.519

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:39.160 
high you can kind of squish it and get

00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:40.619 
high you can kind of squish it and get
it<00:02:39.190> all<00:02:39.489> in<00:02:39.700> the<00:02:39.819> grave<00:02:40.000> and<00:02:40.030> it<00:02:40.299> should<00:02:40.420> stay

00:02:40.619 --> 00:02:40.629 
it all in the grave and it should stay

00:02:40.629 --> 00:02:45.589 
it all in the grave and it should stay
fine<00:02:41.129> allows<00:02:42.129> a<00:02:42.299> ankle<00:02:43.299> a<00:02:43.330> lot<00:02:43.480> of<00:02:43.569> flexibility

inside<00:02:46.680> the<00:02:47.680> rubber<00:02:47.890> here<00:02:48.269> we've<00:02:49.269> mounted<00:02:49.510> a

00:02:49.890 --> 00:02:49.900 
inside the rubber here we've mounted a

00:02:49.900 --> 00:02:53.550 
inside the rubber here we've mounted a
very<00:02:50.170> old<00:02:50.410> boot<00:02:50.739> and<00:02:50.980> the<00:02:51.010> entire<00:02:51.849> this<00:02:52.569> the

00:02:53.550 --> 00:02:53.560 
very old boot and the entire this the

00:02:53.560 --> 00:02:55.319 
very old boot and the entire this the
larger<00:02:54.010> costume<00:02:54.370> boot<00:02:54.549> is<00:02:54.760> actually<00:02:55.120> built

00:02:55.319 --> 00:02:55.329 
larger costume boot is actually built

00:02:55.329 --> 00:03:00.720 
larger costume boot is actually built
around<00:02:55.860> this<00:02:56.860> old<00:02:57.190> boot<00:02:58.030> here<00:02:59.549> so<00:03:00.549> you<00:03:00.610> can

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:00.730 
around this old boot here so you can

00:03:00.730 --> 00:03:02.819 
around this old boot here so you can
kind<00:03:00.910> of<00:03:00.940> just<00:03:01.000> lace<00:03:01.420> it<00:03:01.569> up<00:03:01.629> in<00:03:01.780> here<00:03:01.810> it's<00:03:02.620> a

00:03:02.819 --> 00:03:02.829 
kind of just lace it up in here it's a

00:03:02.829 --> 00:03:04.800 
kind of just lace it up in here it's a
little<00:03:03.040> hard<00:03:03.220> to<00:03:03.340> get<00:03:03.459> into<00:03:03.579> obviously<00:03:04.420> but

00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:04.810 
little hard to get into obviously but

00:03:04.810 --> 00:03:06.449 
little hard to get into obviously but
that's<00:03:05.260> also<00:03:05.470> why<00:03:05.739> we<00:03:05.890> added<00:03:06.280> this<00:03:06.400> little

00:03:06.449 --> 00:03:06.459 
that's also why we added this little

00:03:06.459 --> 00:03:09.270 
that's also why we added this little
nylon<00:03:06.849> strap<00:03:07.480> here<00:03:07.720> to<00:03:07.840> the<00:03:07.930> back<00:03:08.129> this<00:03:09.129> is

00:03:09.270 --> 00:03:09.280 
nylon strap here to the back this is

00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:10.350 
nylon strap here to the back this is
something<00:03:09.549> you<00:03:09.640> can<00:03:09.790> use<00:03:09.819> a<00:03:09.940> little<00:03:10.090> like<00:03:10.329> a

00:03:10.350 --> 00:03:10.360 
something you can use a little like a

00:03:10.360 --> 00:03:12.780 
something you can use a little like a
shoehorn<00:03:10.660> you<00:03:11.049> can<00:03:11.200> grab<00:03:12.010> this<00:03:12.250> and<00:03:12.459> use<00:03:12.640> it

00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:12.790 
shoehorn you can grab this and use it

00:03:12.790 --> 00:03:14.430 
shoehorn you can grab this and use it
for<00:03:13.030> leverage<00:03:13.450> as<00:03:13.780> you're<00:03:13.900> pushing<00:03:14.170> your<00:03:14.379> foot

00:03:14.430 --> 00:03:14.440 
for leverage as you're pushing your foot

00:03:14.440 --> 00:03:18.479 
for leverage as you're pushing your foot
down<00:03:14.799> into<00:03:15.040> this<00:03:15.190> boot<00:03:16.769> once<00:03:17.769> you<00:03:18.280> have<00:03:18.459> that

00:03:18.479 --> 00:03:18.489 
down into this boot once you have that

00:03:18.489 --> 00:03:24.870 
down into this boot once you have that
on<00:03:18.910> you<00:03:19.600> can<00:03:19.720> just<00:03:21.569> with<00:03:22.569> some<00:03:22.780> effort<00:03:23.880> push

00:03:24.870 --> 00:03:24.880 
on you can just with some effort push

00:03:24.880 --> 00:03:26.309 
on you can just with some effort push
the<00:03:25.060> rubber<00:03:25.150> back<00:03:25.480> around<00:03:25.810> and<00:03:26.019> get<00:03:26.139> it<00:03:26.230> all

00:03:26.309 --> 00:03:26.319 
the rubber back around and get it all

00:03:26.319 --> 00:03:28.860 
the rubber back around and get it all
sealed<00:03:26.650> up<00:03:26.799> here<00:03:27.100> and<00:03:27.250> then<00:03:27.340> the<00:03:28.060> Greve<00:03:28.299> closes

00:03:28.860 --> 00:03:28.870 
sealed up here and then the Greve closes

00:03:28.870 --> 00:03:30.599 
sealed up here and then the Greve closes
over<00:03:29.079> the<00:03:29.200> top<00:03:29.380> and<00:03:29.620> nobody<00:03:30.010> really<00:03:30.250> notices

00:03:30.599 --> 00:03:30.609 
over the top and nobody really notices

00:03:30.609 --> 00:03:38.490 
over the top and nobody really notices
the<00:03:30.760> difference<00:03:35.609> so<00:03:36.609> I<00:03:36.959> suppose<00:03:37.959> that<00:03:38.349> would

00:03:38.490 --> 00:03:38.500 
the difference so I suppose that would

00:03:38.500 --> 00:03:40.740 
the difference so I suppose that would
be<00:03:38.530> it<00:03:38.829> for<00:03:39.010> the<00:03:39.099> boots<00:03:39.280> I<00:03:39.609> plan<00:03:40.450> on<00:03:40.569> wearing

these over at pax I should also stress

00:03:43.930 --> 00:03:46.050 
these over at pax I should also stress
that<00:03:43.959> making<00:03:44.560> boots<00:03:44.769> this<00:03:45.040> manner<00:03:45.280> makes<00:03:45.819> them

that making boots this manner makes them

00:03:46.060 --> 00:03:50.970
