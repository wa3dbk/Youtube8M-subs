 if Kai Kelly 

00:00:08.119 --> 00:00:09.969
 Schicksalstag 

00:00:09.969 --> 00:00:13.169
 by Michelle Med Fateful Day is the last day 

00:00:15.729 --> 00:00:17.669
 the libraries 

00:00:17.669 --> 00:00:20.489
 there is no such thing as there is 

00:00:20.489 --> 00:00:23.619
 Bucher the land of history 

00:00:23.619 --> 00:00:25.300
 first project 

00:00:25.300 --> 00:00:28.619
 Of course this is also empty and certain others are censored 

00:00:29.249 --> 00:00:32.249
 but it's just not possible any more and recognize how human who is 

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:36.350
 with the ideas and the others 

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:39.089
 but I can be in Sexten 

00:00:39.089 --> 00:00:40.750
 actually only recommend 

00:00:40.750 --> 00:00:43.360
 because the report is also pretty good 

00:00:43.360 --> 00:00:44.930
 1 

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:47.390
 Of course, it's still very energetic 

00:00:47.390 --> 00:00:50.390
 Load and speed in the topic session 

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:56.910
 and you just can not believe who the killer is 

00:00:58.150 --> 00:00:59.950
 that believes in me 

00:00:59.950 --> 00:01:02.070
 you have to blow the fan 

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:05.070
 if you say it then my heart is shocked 

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:08.060
 I was also pretty shocked 

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:10.450
 I could not believe it 

00:01:10.450 --> 00:01:13.670
 and I do not say anything meant that hears in the background then asked 

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:16.380
 me for Saturday night and today 

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:19.380
 the Saturday night here always because of bottlenecks 

00:01:23.830 --> 00:01:25.150
 I found percent 

00:01:25.150 --> 00:01:28.350
 Michelle Met actually has a pretty nice end to the night 

00:01:31.410 --> 00:01:33.940
 I can only say 

00:01:33.940 --> 00:01:36.390
 thanks for this great week 

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:37.590

 I would have the swr4 a teacher and little hearing thanks finally no real 

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:44.500
 not knowing 

00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:47.630
 and these eggs have been damaged to the greatest extent 

00:01:49.960 --> 00:01:51.670
 and I thank you for that 

00:01:51.670 --> 00:01:53.120
 a break-in 

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:55.690
 Aldi I've ever done 

00:01:55.690 --> 00:01:58.940
 and I wish you a lot of fun reading sixth part 

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:03.400
