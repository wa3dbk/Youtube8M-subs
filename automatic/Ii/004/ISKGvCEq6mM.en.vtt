00:00:08.769 --> 00:00:14.009
 I dont know 

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:16.560
 well, 50 years old is already 50 

00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:18.770
 years the ford mustang a vehicle that 

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:21.449
 born in 1900 younger 

00:00:18.770 --> 00:00:23.579
 963 a vehicle of which we can 

00:00:21.449 --> 00:00:25.890
 talk a lot about a vehicle that 

00:00:23.579 --> 00:00:27.599
 somehow it became iconic for the 

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:30.029
 American automotive industry in 

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:32.400
 sportsmanship terms a vehicle that 

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:34.320
 he created great legends like the lord 

00:00:32.400 --> 00:00:37.860
 shelby carroll a gentleman who of some 

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:40.769
 way he was hired in exprofeso to 

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:43.110
 Do the honors to the Ferrari brand 

00:00:40.769 --> 00:00:45.270
 because he did not want to sell but he did not 

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:48.360
 wanted to sell himself with the oval group 

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:50.879
 blue not good then now in this 50 

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:53.160
 anniversary the ford brand is launching 

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:54.780
 the new ford mustang a vehicle that 

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:56.910
 it looks completely different in the part 

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:58.859
 outside a vehicle that resembles 

00:00:56.910 --> 00:01:01.109
 completely to what we have today with 

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:03.539
 the ford fussion with a big mouth in the 

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:05.550
 part on the front very stylish 

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:08.160
 aston martin who has been questioned a lot 

00:01:05.550 --> 00:01:10.200
 the ford fussion design with respect 

00:01:08.160 --> 00:01:12.149
 to this to this development these two 

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:14.640
 big lips and with this great grill 

00:01:12.149 --> 00:01:16.979
 that has the fiction good ford very 

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:17.550
 similar is nowadays being hosted for 

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:19.290
 the 

00:01:17.550 --> 00:01:20.730
 ford mustang also something very 

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:22.800
 interesting is that it breaks the 

00:01:20.730 --> 00:01:25.170
 headlight design now just a little 

00:01:22.800 --> 00:01:27.330
 light thin elongated with 

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:28.920
 led technology that will also give you good 

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:30.720
 a physiognomy completely to a like 

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:33.150
 that was previously like it was more eyes 

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:35.580
 it was much more robust in the part 

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:37.560
 frontal not with the theme of the eyes 

00:01:35.580 --> 00:01:39.690
 the chest has some design lines 

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:42.450
 that completely break with this chest 

00:01:39.690 --> 00:01:44.340
 long and pronounced yes and the fall of 

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:46.110
 everything is also a little more pronounced 

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:48.660
 towards the back what makes you 

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:50.280
 somehow focus on a greater 

00:01:48.660 --> 00:01:51.300
 aerodynamic on the inside 

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:53.700
 there is also a very important relationship 

00:01:51.300 --> 00:01:54.780
 of the new Ford Mustang we are seeing 

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:57.120
 also incorporation of new 

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:59.220
 materials a completely new design 

00:01:57.120 --> 00:02:00.240
 inside something very similar to what 

00:01:59.220 --> 00:02:03.300
 they were doing the others 

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:05.280
 American both the chevrolet brand 

00:02:03.300 --> 00:02:07.170
 with sting way with the corvette as 

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:09.119
 that is also doing srt with by 

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:11.100
 pair putting much more luxury in the 

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:12.870
 inside doing much more case of the 

00:02:11.100 --> 00:02:14.850
 driver's needs in terms of 

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:16.560
 new materials new elements of 

00:02:14.850 --> 00:02:18.570
 infotainment a vehicle that goes to 

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:20.490
 have the latest generation of ford zinc 

00:02:18.570 --> 00:02:22.530
 and myford touch now something also 

00:02:20.490 --> 00:02:23.680
 very important is the proposal of 

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:26.709
 key engines 

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:29.969
 you have imagined a ford mustang of four 

00:02:26.709 --> 00:02:32.349
 turbocharged cylinders was not 

00:02:29.969 --> 00:02:34.870
 paradoxical because it went against 

00:02:32.349 --> 00:02:36.640
 all the precepts of a motokar not like that 

00:02:34.870 --> 00:02:38.349
 it's good today next season 

00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:40.629
 of formula 1 we will be facing 

00:02:38.349 --> 00:02:43.030
 Six- core engines and the v6 engines 

00:02:40.629 --> 00:02:44.049
 turbocharged the ford mustang is good 

00:02:43.030 --> 00:02:47.079
 will come in three engines 

00:02:44.049 --> 00:02:49.840
 different the first will be a 2.3 liter 

00:02:47.079 --> 00:02:51.430
 with technology ecoboost a technology 

00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:55.269
 ecoboost that is going to be giving us more or 

00:02:51.430 --> 00:02:59.349
 minus 305 horsepower with 300 

00:02:55.269 --> 00:03:01.419
 pound foot of interesting torque in the 

00:02:59.349 --> 00:03:04.870
 equation not here is completely broken 

00:03:01.419 --> 00:03:06.790
 it is already to those motor paradigms 

00:03:04.870 --> 00:03:09.010
 big robust strong by motors 

00:03:06.790 --> 00:03:11.620
 efficient but not for that reason they stop 

00:03:09.010 --> 00:03:12.909
 be powerful the 300 300 horses 

00:03:11.620 --> 00:03:14.709
 horsepower and 300 free 

00:03:12.909 --> 00:03:16.510
 projector than a second motor that goes to 

00:03:14.709 --> 00:03:20.200
 be mounted on the platform of six 

00:03:16.510 --> 00:03:22.480
 will be a 3.7 yes it will be generating 

00:03:20.200 --> 00:03:25.090
 and where neither the nothing despicable if 

00:03:22.480 --> 00:03:28.569
 amount of 300 horsepower yes 

00:03:25.090 --> 00:03:30.939
 but with 270 pounds foot of good torque 

00:03:28.569 --> 00:03:33.159
 and we're going to the most powerful version 

00:03:30.939 --> 00:03:36.459
 of the ford mustang that's going to be 15 

00:03:33.159 --> 00:03:40.569
 v8 cylinders of nothing more and nothing less 

00:03:36.459 --> 00:03:42.459
 that 420 horsepower and 396 

00:03:40.569 --> 00:03:44.319
 foot-pounds of torque these three 

00:03:42.459 --> 00:03:46.329
 motorizations will be configured in 

00:03:44.319 --> 00:03:48.159
 an automatic manual box of six 

00:03:46.329 --> 00:03:51.159
 speeds here the interesting thing is to see 

00:03:48.159 --> 00:03:53.469
 as the ford brand has broken some 

00:03:51.159 --> 00:03:56.439
 form the trend that revived this 

00:03:53.469 --> 00:03:59.409
 mustang that revived after a long 

00:03:56.439 --> 00:04:02.379
 lethargy and you regained this image of 

00:03:59.409 --> 00:04:03.730
 retouch to relive the glories of the 

00:04:02.379 --> 00:04:05.260
 60s 

00:04:03.730 --> 00:04:09.010
 this new mustang that is of some 

00:04:05.260 --> 00:04:11.620
 way blurring that musculature that 

00:04:09.010 --> 00:04:13.930
 characterized for a long time this 

00:04:11.620 --> 00:04:17.769
 of mosul car and is granting it then 

00:04:13.930 --> 00:04:20.349
 as you well comment one more image 

00:04:17.769 --> 00:04:22.150
 aligned with the image of all the rest 

00:04:20.349 --> 00:04:24.280
 from the ford family that looks a lot like 

00:04:22.150 --> 00:04:26.500
 more to fission as you well comment but 

00:04:24.280 --> 00:04:29.860
 he's also picking up some of these 

00:04:26.500 --> 00:04:31.389
 touches that put ecosport something of 

00:04:29.860 --> 00:04:33.909
 what we are seeing in skype something of 

00:04:31.389 --> 00:04:35.249
 what we saw in the conceptual generation 

00:04:33.909 --> 00:04:37.619
 of this one 

00:04:35.249 --> 00:04:39.629
 et that was recently presented there 

00:04:37.619 --> 00:04:42.779
 in the auto show of the angels and you are 

00:04:39.629 --> 00:04:45.329
 aligning to a new corporate image 

00:04:42.779 --> 00:04:47.129
 that from my point of view had left 

00:04:45.329 --> 00:04:49.439
 a little aside we're letting go 

00:04:47.129 --> 00:04:51.569
 renewing after 50 years a car 

00:04:49.439 --> 00:04:53.339
 iconic not only for the oval mark 

00:04:51.569 --> 00:04:55.139
 blue but for the whole industry 

00:04:53.339 --> 00:04:57.599
 American automotive because it has 

00:04:55.139 --> 00:05:01.379
 gone through any amount of 

00:04:57.599 --> 00:05:03.959
 reforms of strategies of tendencies of 

00:05:01.379 --> 00:05:05.969
 engine designs we can talk 

00:05:03.959 --> 00:05:08.309
 that just a few years ago I struck out 

00:05:05.969 --> 00:05:11.039
 I think you some some your first 

00:05:08.309 --> 00:05:13.019
 vehicles were compared with these 

00:05:11.039 --> 00:05:15.059
 engines of just 90 and so many horses 

00:05:13.019 --> 00:05:17.039
 of strength that these came to be 

00:05:15.059 --> 00:05:20.399
 mounted on the like and now we see how 

00:05:17.039 --> 00:05:22.499
 there is a totally oriented renovation 

00:05:20.399 --> 00:05:24.689
 towards energy efficiency and makes 

00:05:22.499 --> 00:05:27.659
 a new era of infotainment of 

00:05:24.689 --> 00:05:29.549
 ex and then aerospace to whatever 

00:05:27.659 --> 00:05:31.499
 publish will bring as all the 

00:05:29.549 --> 00:05:33.149
 mustang with a rear-wheel drive and something 

00:05:31.499 --> 00:05:35.219
 very important and we must emphasize good 

00:05:33.149 --> 00:05:37.409
 the mark of the star oval by god is 

00:05:35.219 --> 00:05:38.849
 being congruent congruent with what 

00:05:37.409 --> 00:05:41.189
 has been raised for some years now 

00:05:38.849 --> 00:05:41.610
 The UN launches this new strategy in 

00:05:41.189 --> 00:05:42.810
 where it says 

00:05:41.610 --> 00:05:45.889
 to work in four very pillars 

00:05:42.810 --> 00:05:45.889
 important one of them 

00:05:47.509 --> 00:05:52.050
 one of them is the use of new 

00:05:50.879 --> 00:05:53.939
 new proposal engines 

00:05:52.050 --> 00:05:55.889
 technological as is this case of four 

00:05:53.939 --> 00:05:58.560
 eco-bus cylinders of 305 horses 

00:05:55.889 --> 00:06:02.000
 force on the other hand an exterior design 

00:05:58.560 --> 00:06:04.439
 much more sportier more current more 

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:06.360
 searched in terms of lines of 

00:06:04.439 --> 00:06:08.009
 look for a differentiating proposal like this 

00:06:06.360 --> 00:06:09.930
 what they are doing today they are 

00:06:08.009 --> 00:06:12.210
 doing very well number three terms 

00:06:09.930 --> 00:06:13.800
 terms of security that have not 

00:06:12.210 --> 00:06:15.779
 left aside and finally also 

00:06:13.800 --> 00:06:16.710
 something very important is the design and 

00:06:15.779 --> 00:06:18.750
 comfort systems e 

00:06:16.710 --> 00:06:20.219
 infoentretenimiento all that we're going to 

00:06:18.750 --> 00:06:22.830
 see reflected in this we are seeing 

00:06:20.219 --> 00:06:25.500
 the embodied well this ford 50 mustang 

00:06:22.830 --> 00:06:28.020
 years you just have to wait for the version 

00:06:25.500 --> 00:06:31.110
 more powerful than it would be in honor action 

00:06:28.020 --> 00:06:32.729
 shelby carroll the elvis 7 I do not know how to 

00:06:31.110 --> 00:06:33.900
 now going to call it can be to 

00:06:32.729 --> 00:06:36.810
 better a vehicle that can be 

00:06:33.900 --> 00:06:38.219
 relaxed the 640 horses that were the 

00:06:36.810 --> 00:06:41.930
 last delivery where he left the ribbon 

00:06:38.219 --> 00:06:41.930
 the ancestor thus is
