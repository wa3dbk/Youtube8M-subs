00:00:24.470 --> 00:00:27.170 

all<00:00:25.470> right<00:00:25.650> this<00:00:25.830> is<00:00:25.980> a<00:00:26.010> classic<00:00:26.580> example<00:00:26.670> of<00:00:27.090> a

00:00:27.170 --> 00:00:27.180 
all right this is a classic example of a

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:29.000 
all right this is a classic example of a
parallelism<00:00:27.720> question<00:00:28.470> it's<00:00:28.710> one<00:00:28.770> of<00:00:28.950> the

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:29.010 
parallelism question it's one of the

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:31.280 
parallelism question it's one of the
easier<00:00:29.310> ones<00:00:29.520> but<00:00:30.270> we'll<00:00:30.360> go<00:00:30.480> through<00:00:30.690> it<00:00:30.840> of

00:00:31.280 --> 00:00:31.290 
easier ones but we'll go through it of

00:00:31.290 --> 00:00:33.530 
easier ones but we'll go through it of
the<00:00:31.770> hundreds<00:00:32.130> of<00:00:32.250> warm<00:00:32.520> water<00:00:32.820> coral<00:00:33.240> species

only<00:00:34.410> a<00:00:34.440> few<00:00:34.830> are<00:00:35.070> highly<00:00:35.520> prized<00:00:35.850> for<00:00:36.150> use<00:00:36.360> in

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:36.540 
only a few are highly prized for use in

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:39.050 
only a few are highly prized for use in
jewelry<00:00:36.750> because<00:00:37.590> of<00:00:37.710> their<00:00:37.860> beauty<00:00:38.370> luster

alright this one says it is far easier
to<00:01:31.280> ride<00:01:31.460> a<00:01:31.490> bicycle<00:01:31.760> than<00:01:32.480> explaining<00:01:32.990> in

00:01:33.190 --> 00:01:33.200 
to ride a bicycle than explaining in

and what you want to notice in this
question<00:01:38.090> is<00:01:38.300> that<00:01:38.570> were<00:01:38.780> once<00:01:39.350> again

00:01:39.490 --> 00:01:39.500 
question is that were once again

comparing things not a serial list here

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:45.790 
comparing things not a serial list here
but<00:01:42.460> we've<00:01:43.460> got<00:01:43.700> it<00:01:43.970> is<00:01:44.240> far<00:01:44.510> easier<00:01:44.720> to<00:01:45.500> ride

00:01:45.790 --> 00:01:45.800 
but we've got it is far easier to ride

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:48.340 
but we've got it is far easier to ride
we've<00:01:46.670> got<00:01:46.850> the<00:01:47.000> infinitive<00:01:47.570> form<00:01:47.870> and<00:01:48.230> that

00:01:48.340 --> 00:01:48.350 
we've got the infinitive form and that

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:52.060 
we've got the infinitive form and that
just<00:01:48.620> means<00:01:48.770> to<00:01:49.100> ride<00:01:49.310> to<00:01:49.670> grow<00:01:49.940> to<00:01:50.420> race<00:01:51.070> to

00:01:52.060 --> 00:01:52.070 
just means to ride to grow to race to

00:01:52.070 --> 00:01:56.190 
just means to ride to grow to race to
swim<00:01:52.370> to<00:01:53.240> whatever<00:01:53.560> to<00:01:54.560> ride<00:01:54.740> a<00:01:54.770> bicycle<00:01:55.010> then

00:01:56.190 --> 00:01:56.200 
swim to whatever to ride a bicycle then

00:02:18.580 --> 00:02:18.590 

00:02:18.590 --> 00:02:21.350 

all<00:02:19.590> right<00:02:19.769> this<00:02:19.920> question<00:02:20.340> says<00:02:20.610> driving

00:02:21.350 --> 00:02:21.360 
all right this question says driving

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:23.030 
all right this question says driving
less<00:02:21.510> frequently<00:02:22.079> is<00:02:22.290> one<00:02:22.500> way<00:02:22.680> to<00:02:22.709> save

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:23.040 
less frequently is one way to save

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:25.429 
less frequently is one way to save
energy<00:02:23.459> to<00:02:24.000> turn<00:02:24.180> off<00:02:24.390> appliances<00:02:25.049> when<00:02:25.319> they

00:02:25.429 --> 00:02:25.439 
energy to turn off appliances when they

00:02:25.439 --> 00:02:28.099 
energy to turn off appliances when they
are<00:02:25.500> not<00:02:25.739> being<00:02:25.950> used<00:02:26.040> is<00:02:26.640> another<00:02:27.060> so<00:02:27.989> what

00:02:28.099 --> 00:02:28.109 
are not being used is another so what

00:02:28.109 --> 00:02:29.330 
are not being used is another so what
you<00:02:28.200> want<00:02:28.319> to<00:02:28.349> notice<00:02:28.620> in<00:02:28.739> this<00:02:28.859> question<00:02:29.250> is

00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:29.340 
you want to notice in this question is

00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:30.410 
you want to notice in this question is
that<00:02:29.489> we're<00:02:29.640> comparing<00:02:30.060> two<00:02:30.390> different

00:02:30.410 --> 00:02:30.420 
that we're comparing two different

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:34.069 
that we're comparing two different
things<00:02:30.959> and<00:02:31.290> those<00:02:31.560> two<00:02:31.829> things<00:02:31.859> are<00:02:33.079> driving

00:02:34.069 --> 00:02:34.079 
things and those two things are driving

00:02:34.079 --> 00:02:38.030 
things and those two things are driving
with<00:02:35.069> an<00:02:35.220> ing<00:02:35.930> so<00:02:36.930> driving<00:02:37.379> less<00:02:37.530> frequently

00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:38.040 
with an ing so driving less frequently

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:41.720 
with an ing so driving less frequently
is<00:02:38.310> one<00:02:38.549> way<00:02:38.670> to<00:02:38.700> save<00:02:39.030> energy<00:02:39.829> turning<00:02:40.829> you

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:41.730 
is one way to save energy turning you

00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:43.309 
is one way to save energy turning you
should<00:02:41.939> hear<00:02:42.150> that<00:02:42.180> in<00:02:42.390> your<00:02:42.540> head<00:02:42.780> turning

00:02:43.309 --> 00:02:43.319 
should hear that in your head turning

00:02:43.319 --> 00:02:46.069 
should hear that in your head turning
off<00:02:44.299> appliances<00:02:45.299> when<00:02:45.569> they're<00:02:45.689> not<00:02:45.900> being

00:02:46.069 --> 00:02:46.079 
off appliances when they're not being

00:02:46.079 --> 00:02:48.500 
off appliances when they're not being
used<00:02:46.439> is<00:02:46.650> another<00:02:46.920> okay<00:02:47.670> so<00:02:48.090> the<00:02:48.180> main<00:02:48.329> thing

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:48.510 
used is another okay so the main thing

00:02:48.510 --> 00:02:50.809 
used is another okay so the main thing
is<00:02:48.629> that<00:02:48.659> when<00:02:48.900> you<00:02:48.989> have<00:02:49.079> ing<00:02:49.799> the<00:02:50.459> other<00:02:50.609> ones

00:02:50.809 --> 00:02:50.819 
is that when you have ing the other ones

00:02:50.819 --> 00:02:54.679 
is that when you have ing the other ones
got<00:02:51.030> to<00:02:51.150> have<00:02:51.299> ing<00:02:51.930> if<00:02:52.379> we<00:02:53.069> had<00:02:53.310> to<00:02:54.060> drive<00:02:54.389> less

00:02:54.679 --> 00:02:54.689 
got to have ing if we had to drive less

00:02:54.689 --> 00:02:56.960 
got to have ing if we had to drive less
frequently<00:02:55.170> then<00:02:55.560> we<00:02:55.709> could<00:02:55.950> use<00:02:56.159> to<00:02:56.519> turn<00:02:56.760> off

00:02:56.960 --> 00:02:56.970 
frequently then we could use to turn off

00:02:56.970 --> 00:03:02.240 
frequently then we could use to turn off
so<00:02:57.689> ing<00:02:58.260> goes<00:02:58.709> with<00:02:58.859> ing<00:02:59.239> to<00:03:00.239> drive<00:03:00.540> to<00:03:01.169> turn<00:03:01.409> so

00:03:02.240 --> 00:03:02.250 
so ing goes with ing to drive to turn so

00:03:02.250 --> 00:03:03.920 
so ing goes with ing to drive to turn so
the<00:03:02.280> key<00:03:02.730> thing<00:03:02.970> with<00:03:03.000> these<00:03:03.239> questions<00:03:03.750> if

00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:03.930 
the key thing with these questions if

00:03:03.930 --> 00:03:05.330 
the key thing with these questions if
you<00:03:04.049> want<00:03:04.139> to<00:03:04.290> get<00:03:04.409> points<00:03:04.680> is<00:03:05.069> make<00:03:05.310> sure

00:03:05.330 --> 00:03:05.340 
you want to get points is make sure

00:03:05.340 --> 00:03:08.750 
you want to get points is make sure
you're<00:03:05.760> always<00:03:05.939> keeping<00:03:06.329> the<00:03:06.840> same<00:03:07.680> form<00:03:08.220> and

you're always keeping the same form and

00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:18.180 
you're always keeping the same form and
I'll<00:03:08.909> get<00:03:09.090> your<00:03:09.239> points<00:03:09.569> on<00:03:09.659> the<00:03:09.750> SAT
