non-lethal<00:02:06.540> now<00:02:07.540> that<00:02:07.750> he's<00:02:07.960> out<00:02:08.110> of<00:02:08.289> the<00:02:08.350> way

00:02:08.460 --> 00:02:08.470 
non-lethal now that he's out of the way

00:02:08.470 --> 00:02:10.080 
non-lethal now that he's out of the way
let's<00:02:08.679> see<00:02:09.130> what<00:02:09.280> speaking<00:02:09.670> around<00:02:09.880> that

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:10.090 
let's see what speaking around that

00:02:10.090 --> 00:02:16.680 
let's see what speaking around that
corner<00:02:14.880> obviously<00:02:15.880> we<00:02:16.000> have<00:02:16.120> a<00:02:16.150> few<00:02:16.420> enemies

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:16.690 
corner obviously we have a few enemies

00:02:16.690 --> 00:02:18.840 
corner obviously we have a few enemies
to<00:02:17.080> get<00:02:17.230> rid<00:02:17.380> of<00:02:17.410> and<00:02:17.800> we<00:02:18.340> might<00:02:18.490> need<00:02:18.670> a<00:02:18.700> bit

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:18.850 
to get rid of and we might need a bit

00:02:18.850 --> 00:02:20.780 
to get rid of and we might need a bit
more<00:02:18.910> animal<00:02:19.420> to<00:02:19.510> do<00:02:19.690> it<00:02:19.840> so<00:02:19.989> let's<00:02:20.200> get<00:02:20.440> some

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:20.790 
more animal to do it so let's get some

00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:22.830 
more animal to do it so let's get some
all<00:02:21.790> right<00:02:21.970> I<00:02:22.000> think<00:02:22.120> we're<00:02:22.420> good<00:02:22.540> to<00:02:22.630> start

00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:22.840 
all right I think we're good to start

00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:34.000 
all right I think we're good to start
our<00:02:22.959> assault

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:34.010 

00:02:34.010 --> 00:02:47.210 

huh

00:02:47.210 --> 00:02:47.220 

00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:50.160 

so<00:02:48.220> this<00:02:48.460> was<00:02:48.640> a<00:02:48.670> purely<00:02:48.970> combat<00:02:49.630> of<00:02:49.810> approach

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:50.170 
so this was a purely combat of approach

00:02:50.170 --> 00:02:51.870 
so this was a purely combat of approach
something<00:02:50.800> you<00:02:50.890> can<00:02:51.040> employ<00:02:51.250> throughout<00:02:51.640> the

00:02:51.870 --> 00:02:51.880 
something you can employ throughout the

00:02:51.880 --> 00:02:53.730 
something you can employ throughout the
game<00:02:52.030> you<00:02:52.600> can<00:02:52.690> also<00:02:52.840> mix<00:02:53.110> it<00:02:53.260> with<00:02:53.380> stealth

00:02:53.730 --> 00:02:53.740 
game you can also mix it with stealth

00:02:53.740 --> 00:02:55.520 
game you can also mix it with stealth
which<00:02:54.040> we'll<00:02:54.250> see<00:02:54.280> in<00:02:54.460> this<00:02:54.700> next<00:02:54.940> playthrough

00:02:55.520 --> 00:02:55.530 
which we'll see in this next playthrough

00:02:55.530 --> 00:03:02.370 
which we'll see in this next playthrough
Richard<00:02:56.530> I'm<00:02:56.950> in<00:03:00.450> since<00:03:01.450> this<00:03:01.690> is<00:03:01.900> a<00:03:01.930> stealth

00:03:02.370 --> 00:03:02.380 
Richard I'm in since this is a stealth

00:03:02.380 --> 00:03:04.590 
Richard I'm in since this is a stealth
approach<00:03:02.560> will<00:03:03.460> use<00:03:03.640> a<00:03:03.670> non-lethal<00:03:04.240> takedown

00:03:04.590 --> 00:03:04.600 
approach will use a non-lethal takedown

00:03:04.600 --> 00:03:14.740 
approach will use a non-lethal takedown
on<00:03:04.810> this<00:03:05.110> first<00:03:05.380> enemy

00:03:14.740 --> 00:03:14.750 

00:03:14.750 --> 00:03:17.240 

we<00:03:15.750> want<00:03:15.959> to<00:03:16.080> be<00:03:16.170> stealthy<00:03:16.650> so<00:03:16.860> let's<00:03:17.069> also

00:03:17.240 --> 00:03:17.250 
we want to be stealthy so let's also

00:03:17.250 --> 00:03:29.220 
we want to be stealthy so let's also
hide<00:03:17.580> the<00:03:17.700> body<00:03:17.909> and<00:03:18.239> loot<00:03:19.110> it<00:03:19.260> just<00:03:19.620> for<00:03:19.769> fun

00:03:29.220 --> 00:03:29.230 

00:03:29.230 --> 00:03:31.450 

now<00:03:30.230> we<00:03:30.290> have<00:03:30.500> to<00:03:30.650> find<00:03:30.860> a<00:03:30.950> way<00:03:31.100> to<00:03:31.160> get<00:03:31.370> around

00:03:31.450 --> 00:03:31.460 
now we have to find a way to get around

00:03:31.460 --> 00:03:34.000 
now we have to find a way to get around
these<00:03:31.910> enemies<00:03:32.240> without<00:03:32.510> being<00:03:32.960> seen<00:03:33.230> the

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:34.010 
these enemies without being seen the

00:03:34.010 --> 00:03:35.830 
these enemies without being seen the
best<00:03:34.220> way<00:03:34.370> to<00:03:34.430> go<00:03:34.610> about<00:03:34.640> this<00:03:34.880> is<00:03:35.270> to<00:03:35.300> explore

00:03:35.830 --> 00:03:35.840 
best way to go about this is to explore

00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:37.690 
best way to go about this is to explore
so<00:03:36.320> let's<00:03:36.530> backtrack<00:03:36.800> and<00:03:37.190> see<00:03:37.400> what<00:03:37.550> was

00:03:37.690 --> 00:03:37.700 
so let's backtrack and see what was

00:03:37.700 --> 00:03:40.960 
so let's backtrack and see what was
hiding<00:03:38.060> in<00:03:38.150> that<00:03:38.180> room<00:03:39.010> when<00:03:40.010> you<00:03:40.190> explore<00:03:40.610> you

00:03:40.960 --> 00:03:40.970 
hiding in that room when you explore you

00:03:40.970 --> 00:03:42.820 
hiding in that room when you explore you
can<00:03:41.180> discover<00:03:41.510> alternate<00:03:42.200> paths<00:03:42.410> that<00:03:42.620> help

00:03:42.820 --> 00:03:42.830 
can discover alternate paths that help

00:03:42.830 --> 00:03:45.370 
can discover alternate paths that help
you<00:03:42.950> go<00:03:43.130> around<00:03:43.220> major<00:03:43.670> obstacles<00:03:44.330> since<00:03:45.080> the

00:03:45.370 --> 00:03:45.380 
you go around major obstacles since the

00:03:45.380 --> 00:03:46.960 
you go around major obstacles since the
level<00:03:45.650> design<00:03:45.770> in<00:03:46.160> Deus<00:03:46.400> Ex<00:03:46.640> Human<00:03:46.820> Revolution

00:03:46.960 --> 00:03:46.970 
level design in Deus Ex Human Revolution

00:03:46.970 --> 00:03:56.620 
level design in Deus Ex Human Revolution
supports<00:03:47.840> many<00:03:48.080> different<00:03:48.470> approaches

00:03:56.620 --> 00:03:56.630 

00:03:56.630 --> 00:03:59.270 

now<00:03:57.630> let's<00:03:57.900> use<00:03:58.110> the<00:03:58.290> cover<00:03:58.530> system<00:03:58.800> to<00:03:59.070> hide

00:03:59.270 --> 00:03:59.280 
now let's use the cover system to hide

00:03:59.280 --> 00:04:01.400 
now let's use the cover system to hide
from<00:03:59.490> these<00:03:59.730> guys<00:03:59.940> well<00:04:00.810> wait<00:04:00.990> until<00:04:01.290> they

00:04:01.400 --> 00:04:01.410 
from these guys well wait until they

00:04:01.410 --> 00:04:03.110 
from these guys well wait until they
finish<00:04:01.680> their<00:04:01.830> patrol<00:04:02.250> and<00:04:02.490> we<00:04:02.820> can<00:04:03.000> gain

00:04:03.110 --> 00:04:03.120 
finish their patrol and we can gain

00:04:03.120 --> 00:04:04.790 
finish their patrol and we can gain
access<00:04:03.360> to<00:04:03.630> the<00:04:03.780> warehouse<00:04:04.020> without<00:04:04.530> being

00:04:04.790 --> 00:04:04.800 
access to the warehouse without being

00:04:04.800 --> 00:04:14.600 
access to the warehouse without being
seen<00:04:12.380> notice<00:04:13.380> that<00:04:13.410> the<00:04:13.590> coverage<00:04:14.010> system<00:04:14.400> is

00:04:14.600 --> 00:04:14.610 
seen notice that the coverage system is

00:04:14.610 --> 00:04:17.180 
seen notice that the coverage system is
used<00:04:14.850> in<00:04:15.030> two<00:04:15.270> ways<00:04:15.510> first<00:04:16.260> to<00:04:16.680> survey<00:04:17.040> your

00:04:17.180 --> 00:04:17.190 
used in two ways first to survey your

00:04:17.190 --> 00:04:19.280 
used in two ways first to survey your
surroundings<00:04:17.760> and<00:04:17.910> plan<00:04:18.150> your<00:04:18.180> approach<00:04:18.690> then

00:04:19.280 --> 00:04:19.290 
surroundings and plan your approach then

00:04:19.290 --> 00:04:21.050 
surroundings and plan your approach then
second<00:04:19.799> to<00:04:19.890> physically<00:04:20.340> hide<00:04:20.579> yourself<00:04:21.000> from

00:04:21.050 --> 00:04:21.060 
second to physically hide yourself from

second to physically hide yourself from
your<00:04:21.329> enemies<00:04:21.510> this<00:04:22.290> is<00:04:22.470> entirely<00:04:22.800> optional

00:04:23.030 --> 00:04:23.040 
your enemies this is entirely optional

00:04:23.040 --> 00:04:40.040 
your enemies this is entirely optional
but<00:04:23.760> very<00:04:24.060> useful

00:04:40.040 --> 00:04:40.050 

00:04:40.050 --> 00:04:44.520

revolution also rewards you for taking
the<00:04:50.590> time<00:04:50.740> to<00:04:50.920> explore<00:04:51.310> and<00:04:51.370> discover

00:04:51.690 --> 00:04:51.700 
the time to explore and discover

00:04:51.700 --> 00:04:54.270 
the time to explore and discover
alternate<00:04:52.570> paths<00:04:52.830> Pritchard<00:04:53.830> mentioned<00:04:54.220> a

00:04:54.270 --> 00:04:54.280 
alternate paths Pritchard mentioned a

00:04:54.280 --> 00:04:56.670 
alternate paths Pritchard mentioned a
roof<00:04:54.490> access<00:04:54.700> in<00:04:55.120> his<00:04:55.270> briefing<00:04:55.720> let's<00:04:56.380> try<00:04:56.560> to

00:04:56.670 --> 00:04:56.680 
roof access in his briefing let's try to

00:04:56.680 --> 00:05:04.560 
roof access in his briefing let's try to
get<00:04:56.860> insight<00:04:57.310> using<00:04:57.760> it

00:05:04.560 --> 00:05:04.570 

00:05:04.570 --> 00:05:06.640 

again<00:05:05.570> we'll<00:05:05.810> need<00:05:05.960> to<00:05:06.110> take<00:05:06.290> care<00:05:06.470> of<00:05:06.530> that

00:05:06.640 --> 00:05:06.650 
again we'll need to take care of that

00:05:06.650 --> 00:05:18.870 
again we'll need to take care of that
century<00:05:07.070> so<00:05:07.700> we'll<00:05:07.850> use<00:05:08.030> another<00:05:08.330> takedown

00:05:18.870 --> 00:05:18.880 

00:05:18.880 --> 00:05:21.220 

let's<00:05:19.880> hide<00:05:20.090> it<00:05:20.210> more<00:05:20.420> carefully<00:05:20.660> this<00:05:21.170> time

00:05:21.220 --> 00:05:21.230 
let's hide it more carefully this time

00:05:21.230 --> 00:05:46.980 
let's hide it more carefully this time
just<00:05:21.830> for<00:05:22.040> fun

00:05:46.980 --> 00:05:46.990 

00:05:46.990 --> 00:05:49.590 

the<00:05:47.590> layout<00:05:47.950> is<00:05:47.980> the<00:05:48.280> same<00:05:48.460> as<00:05:48.610> before<00:05:49.030> but<00:05:49.480> if

00:05:49.590 --> 00:05:49.600 
the layout is the same as before but if

00:05:49.600 --> 00:05:51.570 
the layout is the same as before but if
you<00:05:49.720> look<00:05:49.960> carefully<00:05:50.200> you<00:05:50.860> might<00:05:50.890> find<00:05:51.400> a
