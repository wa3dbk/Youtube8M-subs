00:01:00.139 --> 00:01:00.149 
going to do is you're going to flip it

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:01.700 
going to do is you're going to flip it
over<00:01:00.300> and<00:01:00.539> give<00:01:01.170> me<00:01:01.199> something<00:01:01.500> called<00:01:01.649> a

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:12.750 
do so you're going to take the side

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:14.600 
do so you're going to take the side
closest<00:01:13.229> to<00:01:13.229> you<00:01:13.439> you're<00:01:14.130> going<00:01:14.250> to<00:01:14.310> fold<00:01:14.460> it

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:14.610 
closest to you you're going to fold it

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:18.130 
closest to you you're going to fold it
under<00:01:15.259> top<00:01:16.259> side<00:01:16.500> just<00:01:16.740> like<00:01:16.799> this<00:01:17.040> slide<00:01:17.909> them

00:01:18.130 --> 00:01:18.140 
under top side just like this slide them

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:20.300

00:01:29.569 --> 00:01:29.579 
do is you're going to take two top left

00:01:29.579 --> 00:01:31.749 
do is you're going to take two top left
once<00:01:29.820> and<00:01:30.180> you're<00:01:30.299> just<00:01:30.420> going<00:01:30.600> to<00:01:30.689> pull<00:01:30.930> up

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:52.190 
same side they just opened it up to do a
verse<00:01:48.750> again<00:01:50.119> okay<00:01:51.119> just<00:01:51.780> come<00:01:51.960> out<00:01:52.079> to

00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:52.200 
verse again okay just come out to

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:53.090 
verse again okay just come out to
something<00:01:52.439> different<00:01:52.740> and<00:01:52.829> then<00:01:52.950> you're<00:01:53.070> just

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:53.100 
something different and then you're just

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:56.749 
something different and then you're just
going<00:01:53.310> to<00:01:53.399> flip<00:01:53.490> it<00:01:53.670> over<00:01:53.820> and<00:01:54.799> you<00:01:55.799> come<00:01:56.610> up<00:01:56.729> to

00:01:56.749 --> 00:01:56.759 
going to flip it over and you come up to

00:01:56.759 --> 00:01:58.969 
going to flip it over and you come up to
something<00:01:57.060> like<00:01:57.119> this<00:01:57.290> pattern<00:01:58.290> like<00:01:58.439> this<00:01:58.469> if

00:01:58.969 --> 00:01:58.979 
something like this pattern like this if

00:01:58.979 --> 00:02:01.310 
something like this pattern like this if
you<00:01:59.549> do<00:01:59.759> which<00:02:00.570> I'm<00:02:00.719> just<00:02:00.899> going<00:02:01.020> to<00:02:01.079> do<00:02:01.140> it<00:02:01.229> for

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:01.320 
you do which I'm just going to do it for

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:03.139 
you do which I'm just going to do it for
time<00:02:01.469> purposes<00:02:01.680> you're<00:02:02.640> just<00:02:02.729> going<00:02:02.939> to<00:02:03.000> do<00:02:03.119> a

00:02:03.139 --> 00:02:03.149 
time purposes you're just going to do a

00:02:03.149 --> 00:02:06.940 
time purposes you're just going to do a
roll<00:02:03.479> and<00:02:03.750> then<00:02:04.530> one<00:02:04.770> block<00:02:05.009> over

00:02:06.940 --> 00:02:06.950 
roll and then one block over

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:09.040 
roll and then one block over
and<00:02:07.399> open<00:02:07.579> it<00:02:07.789> back<00:02:07.880> up<00:02:08.060> you<00:02:08.780> should<00:02:08.929> come<00:02:08.989> up

00:02:09.040 --> 00:02:09.050 
and open it back up you should come up

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:12.130 
and open it back up you should come up
to<00:02:09.229> something<00:02:09.440> like<00:02:09.530> this<00:02:09.739> and<00:02:10.610> do<00:02:11.000> a<00:02:11.300> reverse

00:02:12.130 --> 00:02:12.140 
to something like this and do a reverse

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:15.220 
to something like this and do a reverse
and<00:02:13.040> open<00:02:13.510> and<00:02:14.510> you<00:02:14.780> get<00:02:14.900> three<00:02:15.050> floating

00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:15.230 
and open and you get three floating

00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:17.020 
and open and you get three floating
rings<00:02:15.560> but<00:02:16.280> if<00:02:16.430> you<00:02:16.519> don't<00:02:16.700> get<00:02:16.819> something

00:02:17.020 --> 00:02:17.030 
rings but if you don't get something

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:18.100 
rings but if you don't get something
like<00:02:17.180> that<00:02:17.360> all<00:02:17.480> you<00:02:17.599> have<00:02:17.690> to<00:02:17.780> do<00:02:17.930> is<00:02:18.080> just

00:02:18.100 --> 00:02:18.110 
like that all you have to do is just

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:21.160 
like that all you have to do is just
keep<00:02:18.379> doing<00:02:18.739> reverses<00:02:19.690> flipping<00:02:20.690> over<00:02:20.840> for<00:02:21.140> a

00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:21.170 
keep doing reverses flipping over for a

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:24.100 
keep doing reverses flipping over for a
reversed<00:02:21.560> and<00:02:21.800> a<00:02:21.890> wall<00:02:22.069> effect<00:02:22.250> again<00:02:23.110> oops

00:02:24.100 --> 00:02:24.110 
reversed and a wall effect again oops

00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:26.320 
reversed and a wall effect again oops
and<00:02:24.500> then<00:02:24.560> stay<00:02:25.459> the<00:02:25.580> same<00:02:25.730> side<00:02:25.970> for<00:02:26.150> walk

00:02:26.320 --> 00:02:26.330 
and then stay the same side for walk

00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:28.600 
and then stay the same side for walk
back<00:02:26.360> to<00:02:26.630> reverse<00:02:27.080> again<00:02:27.440> and<00:02:27.739> just<00:02:28.430> keep

00:02:28.600 --> 00:02:28.610 
back to reverse again and just keep

00:02:28.610 --> 00:02:31.390 
back to reverse again and just keep
going<00:02:28.880> until<00:02:28.970> you<00:02:29.209> get<00:02:29.800> the<00:02:30.800> full<00:02:31.190> three

00:02:31.390 --> 00:02:31.400 
going until you get the full three

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:36.340 
going until you get the full three
floating<00:02:31.610> rings<00:02:31.970> and<00:02:33.069> that's<00:02:34.069> it
