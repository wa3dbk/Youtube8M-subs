00:00:04.690 --> 00:00:07.179 

when<00:00:05.690> I<00:00:05.720> toe<00:00:05.840> there's<00:00:06.440> only<00:00:06.590> a<00:00:06.710> handful<00:00:07.130> of

00:00:07.179 --> 00:00:07.189 
when I toe there's only a handful of

00:00:07.189 --> 00:00:10.840 
when I toe there's only a handful of
things<00:00:07.399> that<00:00:07.609> I<00:00:07.640> do<00:00:07.759> I<00:00:08.210> actually<00:00:09.850> velcroed

00:00:10.840 --> 00:00:10.850 
things that I do I actually velcroed

00:00:10.850 --> 00:00:12.580 
things that I do I actually velcroed
these<00:00:11.090> because<00:00:11.420> I<00:00:11.510> found<00:00:11.780> that<00:00:12.049> even<00:00:12.290> the

00:00:12.580 --> 00:00:12.590 
these because I found that even the

00:00:12.590 --> 00:00:14.499 
these because I found that even the
little<00:00:12.950> latch<00:00:13.130> they<00:00:13.490> had<00:00:13.700> it<00:00:13.940> still<00:00:14.179> can<00:00:14.360> pop

00:00:14.499 --> 00:00:14.509 
little latch they had it still can pop

00:00:14.509 --> 00:00:17.650 
little latch they had it still can pop
open<00:00:14.690> so<00:00:15.440> all<00:00:15.620> those<00:00:15.799> are<00:00:16.009> velcroed<00:00:16.480> the<00:00:17.480> stuff

00:00:17.650 --> 00:00:17.660 
open so all those are velcroed the stuff

00:00:17.660 --> 00:00:19.630 
open so all those are velcroed the stuff
right<00:00:17.840> there<00:00:17.869> basically<00:00:18.560> moves<00:00:18.950> into<00:00:19.550> the

00:00:19.630 --> 00:00:19.640 
right there basically moves into the

00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:22.900 
right there basically moves into the
sink<00:00:20.529> these<00:00:21.529> seats<00:00:21.859> are<00:00:22.100> great<00:00:22.460> because

00:00:22.900 --> 00:00:22.910 
sink these seats are great because

00:00:22.910 --> 00:00:24.849 
sink these seats are great because
nothing<00:00:23.420> moves<00:00:23.720> when<00:00:23.960> you<00:00:24.050> put<00:00:24.230> them<00:00:24.350> on<00:00:24.500> my

00:00:24.849 --> 00:00:24.859 
nothing moves when you put them on my

00:00:24.859 --> 00:00:27.490 
nothing moves when you put them on my
computer<00:00:24.890> it's<00:00:25.550> all<00:00:25.730> on<00:00:26.000> a<00:00:26.109> little<00:00:27.109> it's<00:00:27.349> on<00:00:27.470> a

a<00:01:44.329> relative<00:01:44.780> term<00:01:45.049> for<00:01:45.619> sure<00:01:46.390> but<00:01:47.390> i<00:01:47.780> thought<00:01:48.110> i

00:01:48.160 --> 00:01:48.170 
a relative term for sure but i thought i

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:51.760 
a relative term for sure but i thought i
would<00:01:48.350> share<00:01:48.740> how<00:01:49.310> much<00:01:49.640> i<00:01:50.000> love<00:01:50.689> a<00:01:51.170> couple

00:01:53.710 --> 00:01:53.720 
things about it and i think this is

really<00:01:53.869> the<00:01:54.140> northeast<00:01:54.560> so<00:01:54.709> those<00:01:54.890> of<00:01:54.920> you

00:01:55.090 --> 00:01:55.100 
really the northeast so those of you

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:57.160 
really the northeast so those of you
from<00:01:55.280> the<00:01:55.369> Northeast<00:01:55.880> you'll<00:01:56.090> can<00:01:56.720> attest<00:01:57.049> to

from the Northeast you'll can attest to
this<00:01:57.380> one<00:01:58.310> thing<00:01:58.549> and<00:01:58.700> Ashley<00:01:59.030> I<00:01:59.060> think<00:01:59.270> this

00:01:59.350 --> 00:01:59.360 
this one thing and Ashley I think this

00:01:59.360 --> 00:02:03.130 
this one thing and Ashley I think this
is<00:01:59.420> the<00:01:59.569> MIDI<00:01:59.840> Midwest<00:02:00.439> to<00:02:01.119> one<00:02:02.119> thing<00:02:02.360> that<00:02:02.959> is

is the MIDI Midwest to one thing that is

00:02:03.140 --> 00:02:06.080 
is the MIDI Midwest to one thing that is
different<00:02:03.170> than<00:02:03.709> the

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:06.090 

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:08.749 

West<00:02:06.840> Coast<00:02:06.960> and<00:02:07.439> I'm<00:02:07.530> used<00:02:07.770> to<00:02:07.950> as<00:02:08.220> census

00:02:08.749 --> 00:02:08.759 
West Coast and I'm used to as census

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:12.080 
West Coast and I'm used to as census
people<00:02:09.539> really<00:02:10.019> don't<00:02:10.410> have<00:02:10.830> fences<00:02:11.489> here<00:02:11.790> or

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:12.090 
people really don't have fences here or

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:14.059 
people really don't have fences here or
they<00:02:12.569> do<00:02:12.629> I<00:02:13.110> mean<00:02:13.349> that's<00:02:13.530> every

00:02:14.059 --> 00:02:14.069 
they do I mean that's every

00:02:14.069 --> 00:02:16.130 
they do I mean that's every
generalization<00:02:14.730> there's<00:02:14.940> exceptions<00:02:15.239> but

00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:16.140 
generalization there's exceptions but

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:17.809 
generalization there's exceptions but
there's<00:02:16.319> not<00:02:16.470> as<00:02:16.650> many<00:02:16.860> and<00:02:17.250> so<00:02:17.430> everything

00:02:17.809 --> 00:02:17.819 
there's not as many and so everything

00:02:17.819 --> 00:02:22.550 
there's not as many and so everything
feels<00:02:18.300> so<00:02:18.480> open<00:02:18.959> and<00:02:19.819> large<00:02:20.819> and<00:02:21.440> granted<00:02:22.440> it

00:02:22.550 --> 00:02:22.560 
feels so open and large and granted it

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:25.160 
feels so open and large and granted it
is<00:02:22.739> I<00:02:23.069> mean<00:02:23.519> it's<00:02:23.790> a<00:02:24.090> really<00:02:24.269> special<00:02:24.629> place

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:25.170 
is I mean it's a really special place

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:28.160 
is I mean it's a really special place
here<00:02:25.500> and<00:02:25.680> then<00:02:26.280> the<00:02:26.400> other<00:02:26.549> thing<00:02:26.670> that<00:02:27.360> I

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:28.170 
here and then the other thing that I

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:32.030 
here and then the other thing that I
really<00:02:28.349> love<00:02:28.739> is<00:02:29.129> the<00:02:29.700> little<00:02:29.910> townships<00:02:31.040> so

00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:32.040 
really love is the little townships so

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:36.559 
really love is the little townships so
within<00:02:33.230> blocks<00:02:34.250> there's<00:02:35.250> little<00:02:35.790> townships<00:02:36.390> I

00:02:36.559 --> 00:02:36.569 
within blocks there's little townships I

00:02:36.569 --> 00:02:38.180 
within blocks there's little townships I
mean<00:02:36.720> it's<00:02:36.930> kind<00:02:37.470> of<00:02:37.500> hard<00:02:37.680> to<00:02:37.739> keep<00:02:37.890> track<00:02:37.950> of

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:38.190 
mean it's kind of hard to keep track of

00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:40.009 
mean it's kind of hard to keep track of
all<00:02:38.430> the<00:02:38.579> different<00:02:38.849> places<00:02:39.060> and<00:02:39.450> where<00:02:39.630> I<00:02:39.660> am

00:02:40.009 --> 00:02:40.019 
all the different places and where I am

00:02:40.019 --> 00:02:43.190 
all the different places and where I am
and<00:02:40.230> what's<00:02:40.410> close<00:02:40.730> but<00:02:41.730> it<00:02:42.180> sure<00:02:42.540> makes<00:02:42.750> for

00:02:43.190 --> 00:02:43.200 
and what's close but it sure makes for

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:46.220 
and what's close but it sure makes for
really<00:02:44.010> nice<00:02:44.340> small<00:02:44.819> community<00:02:45.420> because

00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:46.230 
really nice small community because

00:02:46.230 --> 00:02:48.559 
really nice small community because
everybody's<00:02:46.860> got<00:02:47.099> this<00:02:47.459> little<00:02:47.730> town<00:02:48.090> center

00:02:48.559 --> 00:02:48.569 
everybody's got this little town center

00:02:48.569 --> 00:02:51.350 
everybody's got this little town center
and<00:02:48.750> obviously<00:02:49.110> this<00:02:49.349> is<00:02:49.590> how<00:02:50.489> it<00:02:50.700> was<00:02:50.879> back<00:02:51.180> in

00:02:51.350 --> 00:02:51.360 
and obviously this is how it was back in

00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:53.420 
and obviously this is how it was back in
the<00:02:51.390> day<00:02:51.660> when<00:02:51.959> we<00:02:52.140> didn't<00:02:52.349> have<00:02:52.530> cars<00:02:52.920> and<00:02:53.160> we
