series of discoveries when it was first
found<00:00:42.750> it<00:00:43.750> was<00:00:43.870> a<00:00:43.900> difficult<00:00:44.140> fossil<00:00:44.650> to

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:44.710 
found it was a difficult fossil to

00:00:44.710 --> 00:00:46.229 
found it was a difficult fossil to
interpret<00:00:45.160> the<00:00:45.370> bones<00:00:45.550> were<00:00:45.730> still<00:00:46.090> covered

00:00:46.229 --> 00:00:46.239 
interpret the bones were still covered

00:00:46.239 --> 00:00:49.139 
interpret the bones were still covered
in<00:00:46.450> sediment<00:00:47.200> and<00:00:47.440> I've<00:00:48.040> been<00:00:48.399> the<00:00:48.670> person<00:00:48.940> who

00:00:49.139 --> 00:00:49.149 
in sediment and I've been the person who

00:00:49.149 --> 00:00:50.600 
in sediment and I've been the person who
discovered<00:00:49.600> it<00:00:49.660> Don<00:00:49.809> and<00:00:49.960> Jay<00:00:50.050> Mojave

interpreted that we had eggs and we had

00:00:53.770 --> 00:00:55.889 
interpreted that we had eggs and we had
bones<00:00:54.039> of<00:00:54.460> some<00:00:54.969> animal<00:00:55.300> and<00:00:55.480> he<00:00:55.570> interpret

that animal to be a dinosaur in fact
some<00:00:58.270> of<00:00:58.300> the<00:00:58.420> bones<00:00:58.570> were<00:00:58.780> bones<00:00:59.050> of

00:00:59.220 --> 00:00:59.230 
some of the bones were bones of

00:00:59.230 --> 00:01:01.200 
some of the bones were bones of
dinosaurs<00:00:59.460> but<00:01:00.460> some<00:01:00.640> of<00:01:00.730> the<00:01:00.820> other<00:01:00.940> bones

dinosaurs but some of the other bones
were<00:01:01.480> bones<00:01:01.930> of<00:01:02.050> a<00:01:02.110> different<00:01:02.410> animal<00:01:02.680> and<00:01:02.829> it

wasn't<00:01:03.190> recognized<00:01:03.839> until<00:01:04.839> I<00:01:05.320> visited<00:01:05.830> the

00:01:06.359 --> 00:01:06.369 
wasn't recognized until I visited the

00:01:06.369 --> 00:01:08.520 
wasn't recognized until I visited the
collections<00:01:06.789> of<00:01:07.360> Don<00:01:07.570> of<00:01:07.780> Dhananjay<00:01:08.140> Mojave

00:01:08.530 --> 00:01:12.719 
collections of Don of Dhananjay Mojave
in<00:01:08.649> 2001<00:01:09.280> and<00:01:10.200> when<00:01:11.200> I<00:01:11.229> went<00:01:11.470> to<00:01:11.530> his<00:01:11.649> lab<00:01:11.860> I<00:01:12.340> had

00:01:12.719 --> 00:01:12.729 
in 2001 and when I went to his lab I had

00:01:12.729 --> 00:01:14.160 
in 2001 and when I went to his lab I had
asked<00:01:12.940> to<00:01:13.030> see<00:01:13.090> this<00:01:13.390> specimen<00:01:13.720> because<00:01:13.930> I<00:01:14.050> was

00:01:14.160 --> 00:01:14.170 
asked to see this specimen because I was

00:01:14.170 --> 00:01:15.240 
asked to see this specimen because I was
interested<00:01:14.320> in<00:01:14.500> seeing<00:01:14.649> this<00:01:14.800> dinosaur

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:15.250 
interested in seeing this dinosaur

00:01:15.250 --> 00:01:17.850 
interested in seeing this dinosaur
hatchling<00:01:15.820> with<00:01:15.970> the<00:01:16.149> eggs<00:01:16.300> and<00:01:16.830> when<00:01:17.830> I

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:17.860 
hatchling with the eggs and when I

00:01:17.860 --> 00:01:19.859 
hatchling with the eggs and when I
looked<00:01:18.099> at<00:01:18.190> it<00:01:18.250> I<00:01:18.610> have<00:01:18.880> a<00:01:18.910> stunned<00:01:19.270> because<00:01:19.660> I

00:01:19.859 --> 00:01:19.869 
looked at it I have a stunned because I

00:01:19.869 --> 00:01:22.020 
looked at it I have a stunned because I
recognized<00:01:20.349> that<00:01:20.530> some<00:01:21.369> of<00:01:21.490> the<00:01:21.580> bones<00:01:21.700> that

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:22.030 
recognized that some of the bones that

00:01:22.030 --> 00:01:23.730 
recognized that some of the bones that
were<00:01:22.119> interpreted<00:01:22.420> as<00:01:22.690> maybe<00:01:22.990> being<00:01:23.080> dinosaur

00:01:23.730 --> 00:01:23.740 
were interpreted as maybe being dinosaur

00:01:23.740 --> 00:01:26.070 
were interpreted as maybe being dinosaur
bones<00:01:23.950> were<00:01:24.130> in<00:01:24.250> fact<00:01:24.520> the<00:01:25.390> bones<00:01:25.599> of<00:01:25.750> a<00:01:25.810> snake

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:26.080 
bones were in fact the bones of a snake

00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:28.499 
bones were in fact the bones of a snake
and<00:01:26.380> we<00:01:27.280> could<00:01:27.429> recognize<00:01:27.610> those<00:01:28.060> bones<00:01:28.330> as

00:01:28.499 --> 00:01:28.509 
and we could recognize those bones as

00:01:28.509 --> 00:01:30.020 
and we could recognize those bones as
being<00:01:28.720> snake<00:01:28.959> bones<00:01:29.200> because<00:01:29.590> they<00:01:29.740> have

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:30.030 
being snake bones because they have

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:32.669 
being snake bones because they have
characteristic<00:01:31.030> articulations<00:01:31.599> that<00:01:32.020> lock

00:01:32.669 --> 00:01:32.679 
characteristic articulations that lock

00:01:32.679 --> 00:01:34.980 
characteristic articulations that lock
the<00:01:32.920> bone<00:01:33.069> so<00:01:33.340> snakes<00:01:33.670> have<00:01:33.880> very<00:01:34.539> twisty

00:01:34.980 --> 00:01:34.990 
the bone so snakes have very twisty

00:01:34.990 --> 00:01:37.559 
the bone so snakes have very twisty
bodies<00:01:35.349> but<00:01:36.099> in<00:01:36.250> fact<00:01:36.490> they<00:01:37.090> have<00:01:37.209> very<00:01:37.420> little

00:01:37.559 --> 00:01:37.569 
bodies but in fact they have very little

00:01:37.569 --> 00:01:39.719 
bodies but in fact they have very little
mobility<00:01:37.869> between<00:01:38.229> vertebrae<00:01:39.099> a<00:01:39.399> lot<00:01:39.640> of

00:01:39.719 --> 00:01:39.729 
mobility between vertebrae a lot of

00:01:39.729 --> 00:01:41.130 
mobility between vertebrae a lot of
their<00:01:39.819> mobility<00:01:40.060> is<00:01:40.300> because<00:01:40.569> they<00:01:40.720> have<00:01:40.869> a

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:41.140 
their mobility is because they have a

00:01:41.140 --> 00:01:42.930 
their mobility is because they have a
little<00:01:41.530> bit<00:01:41.679> of<00:01:41.800> freedom<00:01:42.009> in<00:01:42.340> between

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:42.940 
little bit of freedom in between

00:01:42.940 --> 00:01:46.290 
little bit of freedom in between
hundreds<00:01:43.420> of<00:01:43.539> vertebrae<00:01:43.929> so<00:01:44.590> in<00:01:45.160> about<00:01:45.640> 2001

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:46.300 
hundreds of vertebrae so in about 2001

00:01:46.300 --> 00:01:48.150 
hundreds of vertebrae so in about 2001
we<00:01:46.899> figured<00:01:47.229> out<00:01:47.349> that<00:01:47.380> this<00:01:47.679> is<00:01:47.830> a<00:01:47.860> really

00:01:48.150 --> 00:01:48.160 
we figured out that this is a really

00:01:48.160 --> 00:01:49.919 
we figured out that this is a really
exceptional<00:01:48.610> fossil<00:01:49.239> because<00:01:49.450> snakes<00:01:49.750> are

00:01:49.919 --> 00:01:49.929 
exceptional fossil because snakes are

00:01:49.929 --> 00:01:51.719 
exceptional fossil because snakes are
extraordinarily<00:01:50.470> rare<00:01:50.830> during<00:01:51.220> the<00:01:51.369> dinosaur

00:01:51.719 --> 00:01:51.729 
extraordinarily rare during the dinosaur

00:01:51.729 --> 00:01:54.630 
extraordinarily rare during the dinosaur
era<00:01:51.880> we<00:01:52.720> have<00:01:52.899> probably<00:01:53.289> a<00:01:53.560> half<00:01:53.860> dozen<00:01:54.099> snakes

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:54.640 
era we have probably a half dozen snakes

00:01:54.640 --> 00:01:57.029 
era we have probably a half dozen snakes
that<00:01:54.910> are<00:01:55.000> known<00:01:55.149> with<00:01:55.300> skulls<00:01:55.660> and<00:01:55.989> bodies<00:01:56.500> we

00:01:57.029 --> 00:01:57.039 
that are known with skulls and bodies we

00:01:57.039 --> 00:01:58.469 
that are known with skulls and bodies we
have<00:01:57.069> lots<00:01:57.310> of<00:01:57.399> snakes<00:01:57.640> in<00:01:57.789> other<00:01:57.910> places<00:01:58.179> but

00:01:58.469 --> 00:01:58.479 
have lots of snakes in other places but

00:01:58.479 --> 00:02:00.210 
have lots of snakes in other places but
the<00:01:58.810> ones<00:01:58.959> that<00:01:59.080> have<00:01:59.200> skulls<00:01:59.770> and<00:01:59.950> bodies

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:00.220 
the ones that have skulls and bodies

00:02:00.220 --> 00:02:02.160 
the ones that have skulls and bodies
ones<00:02:00.429> that<00:02:00.520> are<00:02:00.610> really<00:02:00.819> good<00:02:01.179> specimens<00:02:01.720> come

00:02:02.160 --> 00:02:02.170 
ones that are really good specimens come

00:02:02.170 --> 00:02:04.169 
ones that are really good specimens come
from<00:02:02.380> a<00:02:02.440> couple<00:02:02.619> of<00:02:02.739> different<00:02:02.860> areas<00:02:03.190> and<00:02:03.580> so

00:02:04.169 --> 00:02:04.179 
from a couple of different areas and so

00:02:04.179 --> 00:02:06.749 
from a couple of different areas and so
far<00:02:04.420> none<00:02:04.750> had<00:02:05.020> come<00:02:05.200> from<00:02:05.410> India<00:02:05.649> so<00:02:06.550> I<00:02:06.580> knew

00:02:06.749 --> 00:02:06.759 
far none had come from India so I knew

00:02:06.759 --> 00:02:08.070 
far none had come from India so I knew
that<00:02:06.910> it<00:02:07.000> was<00:02:07.090> an<00:02:07.149> important<00:02:07.479> fossil<00:02:07.599> and<00:02:08.020> the

00:02:08.070 --> 00:02:08.080 
that it was an important fossil and the

00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:10.440 
that it was an important fossil and the
fact<00:02:08.289> that<00:02:08.380> this<00:02:08.560> snake<00:02:08.860> was<00:02:09.179> sitting<00:02:10.179> next<00:02:10.300> to

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:10.450 
fact that this snake was sitting next to

00:02:10.450 --> 00:02:12.210 
fact that this snake was sitting next to
dinosaur<00:02:10.899> eggs<00:02:11.080> and<00:02:11.319> perhaps<00:02:11.470> next<00:02:12.069> to

00:02:12.210 --> 00:02:12.220 
dinosaur eggs and perhaps next to

00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:13.680 
dinosaur eggs and perhaps next to
dinosaur<00:02:12.580> bones<00:02:12.819> meant<00:02:13.209> that<00:02:13.390> there<00:02:13.540> was

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:13.690 
dinosaur bones meant that there was

00:02:13.690 --> 00:02:15.390 
dinosaur bones meant that there was
perhaps<00:02:13.890> something<00:02:14.890> else<00:02:15.040> that<00:02:15.190> we<00:02:15.280> could

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:15.400 
perhaps something else that we could

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:17.729 
perhaps something else that we could
find<00:02:15.700> from<00:02:16.060> this<00:02:16.180> fossil<00:02:16.599> so<00:02:16.870> that<00:02:17.080> began<00:02:17.440> kind

00:02:17.729 --> 00:02:17.739 
find from this fossil so that began kind

00:02:17.739 --> 00:02:20.760 
find from this fossil so that began kind
of<00:02:17.800> a<00:02:17.890> long<00:02:18.069> Odyssey<00:02:18.640> from<00:02:19.420> 2001<00:02:19.959> so<00:02:20.290> here<00:02:20.650> we

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:20.770 
of a long Odyssey from 2001 so here we

00:02:20.770 --> 00:02:23.550 
of a long Odyssey from 2001 so here we
are<00:02:20.800> in<00:02:21.010> 2010<00:02:21.640> where<00:02:22.600> Don<00:02:23.140> and<00:02:23.320> Jay<00:02:23.410> and<00:02:23.500> I

00:02:23.550 --> 00:02:23.560 
are in 2010 where Don and Jay and I

00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:25.410 
are in 2010 where Don and Jay and I
worked<00:02:23.740> together<00:02:23.890> I<00:02:24.370> immediately<00:02:24.700> told<00:02:25.150> him

00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:25.420 
worked together I immediately told him

00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:26.820 
worked together I immediately told him
that<00:02:25.780> I<00:02:25.810> thought<00:02:26.020> it<00:02:26.110> was<00:02:26.200> a<00:02:26.230> snake<00:02:26.350> and<00:02:26.650> it<00:02:26.710> was

00:02:26.820 --> 00:02:26.830 
that I thought it was a snake and it was

00:02:26.830 --> 00:02:27.240 
that I thought it was a snake and it was
important

00:02:27.240 --> 00:02:27.250 
important

00:02:27.250 --> 00:02:28.650 
important
and<00:02:27.340> he<00:02:27.430> said<00:02:27.640> let's<00:02:27.850> do<00:02:28.060> something<00:02:28.360> with<00:02:28.450> it

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:28.660 
and he said let's do something with it

00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:30.660 
and he said let's do something with it
he<00:02:28.810> then<00:02:28.960> sort<00:02:29.200> of<00:02:29.260> waiting<00:02:29.560> for<00:02:29.710> someone<00:02:29.890> to

00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:30.670 
he then sort of waiting for someone to

00:02:30.670 --> 00:02:33.150 
he then sort of waiting for someone to
take<00:02:30.940> interest<00:02:31.270> in<00:02:31.360> the<00:02:31.450> specimen<00:02:31.870> we<00:02:32.830> spent

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:33.160 
take interest in the specimen we spent

00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:34.950 
take interest in the specimen we spent
probably<00:02:33.880> three<00:02:34.360> or<00:02:34.390> four<00:02:34.510> years<00:02:34.780> getting

00:02:34.950 --> 00:02:34.960 
probably three or four years getting

00:02:34.960 --> 00:02:36.240 
probably three or four years getting

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:38.770 
to borrow the specimen and we got

00:02:38.770 --> 00:02:40.170 
to borrow the specimen and we got
permission<00:02:38.920> we<00:02:39.310> brought<00:02:39.550> that's<00:02:39.790> but<00:02:39.970> this

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:40.180 
permission we brought that's but this

00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:41.700 
permission we brought that's but this

specimen to University of Michigan where

00:02:41.710 --> 00:02:43.440 
specimen to University of Michigan where
it<00:02:41.860> was<00:02:41.980> clean<00:02:42.310> painstakingly<00:02:43.060> over<00:02:43.330> the

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:43.450 
it was clean painstakingly over the

00:02:43.450 --> 00:02:45.780 
it was clean painstakingly over the
course<00:02:43.630> of<00:02:43.870> a<00:02:43.930> year<00:02:43.959> with<00:02:44.860> needles<00:02:45.340> taking

00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:45.790 
course of a year with needles taking

00:02:45.790 --> 00:02:48.000 
course of a year with needles taking
grain<00:02:46.000> by<00:02:46.180> grain<00:02:46.209> off<00:02:46.810> of<00:02:47.140> the<00:02:47.200> specimen<00:02:47.650> and

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:48.010 
grain by grain off of the specimen and

00:02:48.010 --> 00:02:50.910 
grain by grain off of the specimen and
when<00:02:48.970> the<00:02:49.090> specimen<00:02:49.480> was<00:02:49.630> clean<00:02:49.930> it<00:02:50.500> revealed

00:02:50.910 --> 00:02:50.920 
when the specimen was clean it revealed

00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:53.760 
when the specimen was clean it revealed
an<00:02:51.220> extraordinary<00:02:52.090> fossil<00:02:52.570> that<00:02:52.600> I<00:02:53.020> had<00:02:53.530> no

00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:53.770 
an extraordinary fossil that I had no

00:02:53.770 --> 00:02:56.130 
an extraordinary fossil that I had no
idea<00:02:54.130> was<00:02:54.280> going<00:02:54.340> to<00:02:54.550> be<00:02:54.750> underneath<00:02:55.750> some<00:02:56.050> of

00:02:56.130 --> 00:02:56.140 
idea was going to be underneath some of

00:02:56.140 --> 00:02:59.040 
idea was going to be underneath some of
the<00:02:56.200> sediment<00:02:56.650> so<00:02:56.770> we<00:02:56.890> found<00:02:57.160> a<00:02:57.430> skull<00:02:58.050> we

00:02:59.040 --> 00:02:59.050 
the sediment so we found a skull we

00:02:59.050 --> 00:03:01.670 
the sediment so we found a skull we
found<00:02:59.350> a<00:02:59.650> body<00:03:00.100> of<00:03:00.370> a<00:03:00.459> snake<00:03:00.520> that<00:03:01.030> was<00:03:01.150> coiled

00:03:01.670 --> 00:03:01.680 
found a body of a snake that was coiled

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:04.170 
found a body of a snake that was coiled
so<00:03:02.680> the<00:03:02.860> skull<00:03:03.100> was<00:03:03.250> sitting<00:03:03.520> on<00:03:03.640> top<00:03:03.850> of<00:03:04.090> the

00:03:04.170 --> 00:03:04.180 
so the skull was sitting on top of the

00:03:04.180 --> 00:03:06.479 
so the skull was sitting on top of the
coil<00:03:04.420> and<00:03:04.690> inside<00:03:05.620> the<00:03:05.800> coil<00:03:06.010> of<00:03:06.160> the<00:03:06.220> snake

00:03:06.479 --> 00:03:06.489 
coil and inside the coil of the snake

00:03:06.489 --> 00:03:10.080 
coil and inside the coil of the snake
was<00:03:07.420> a<00:03:07.780> set<00:03:08.320> of<00:03:08.440> fragmented<00:03:09.370> eggshells<00:03:09.790> that

00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:10.090 
was a set of fragmented eggshells that

00:03:10.090 --> 00:03:12.030 
was a set of fragmented eggshells that
you<00:03:10.180> see<00:03:10.360> here<00:03:10.660> and<00:03:10.840> as<00:03:11.320> it<00:03:11.470> turns<00:03:11.650> out<00:03:11.860> there

00:03:12.030 --> 00:03:12.040 
you see here and as it turns out there

00:03:12.040 --> 00:03:14.400 
you see here and as it turns out there
are<00:03:12.130> two<00:03:12.160> other<00:03:12.489> eggs<00:03:12.760> this<00:03:13.480> one<00:03:13.690> and<00:03:13.959> this<00:03:14.170> one

00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:14.410 
are two other eggs this one and this one

00:03:14.410 --> 00:03:17.520 
are two other eggs this one and this one
from<00:03:15.070> the<00:03:15.220> same<00:03:15.430> site<00:03:15.760> that<00:03:16.420> were<00:03:16.510> intact<00:03:16.900> so

00:03:17.520 --> 00:03:17.530 
from the same site that were intact so

00:03:17.530 --> 00:03:18.600 
from the same site that were intact so
they<00:03:17.650> weren't<00:03:17.830> crushed<00:03:18.070> at<00:03:18.250> all

00:03:18.600 --> 00:03:18.610 
they weren't crushed at all

00:03:18.610 --> 00:03:20.520 
they weren't crushed at all
and<00:03:18.700> so<00:03:19.360> something<00:03:19.690> must<00:03:19.810> have<00:03:19.959> crushed<00:03:20.230> this

00:03:20.520 --> 00:03:20.530 
and so something must have crushed this

00:03:20.530 --> 00:03:23.850 
and so something must have crushed this
egg<00:03:20.770> and<00:03:21.100> we<00:03:21.730> later<00:03:21.940> learned<00:03:22.350> on<00:03:23.350> the<00:03:23.440> basis<00:03:23.770> of

00:03:23.850 --> 00:03:23.860 
egg and we later learned on the basis of

00:03:23.860 --> 00:03:24.990 
egg and we later learned on the basis of
the<00:03:23.980> presence<00:03:24.310> of<00:03:24.370> a<00:03:24.459> hatchling

00:03:24.990 --> 00:03:25.000 
the presence of a hatchling

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:27.210 
the presence of a hatchling
that<00:03:25.780> we<00:03:25.840> saw<00:03:25.989> right<00:03:26.200> next<00:03:26.440> to<00:03:26.500> it<00:03:26.620> that<00:03:27.070> this

00:03:27.210 --> 00:03:27.220 
that we saw right next to it that this

00:03:27.220 --> 00:03:29.040 
that we saw right next to it that this
was<00:03:27.370> probably<00:03:27.520> an<00:03:27.760> egg<00:03:27.910> that<00:03:28.540> was<00:03:28.690> recently

00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:29.050 
was probably an egg that was recently

00:03:29.050 --> 00:03:31.770 
was probably an egg that was recently
hatched<00:03:29.290> and<00:03:29.650> it's<00:03:30.370> crushed<00:03:30.670> because<00:03:30.940> the

00:03:31.770 --> 00:03:31.780 
hatched and it's crushed because the

00:03:31.780 --> 00:03:33.960 
hatched and it's crushed because the
animal<00:03:32.140> that<00:03:32.230> left<00:03:32.470> the<00:03:32.620> egg<00:03:32.769> left<00:03:33.760> the<00:03:33.880> egg

00:03:33.960 --> 00:03:33.970 
animal that left the egg left the egg

00:03:33.970 --> 00:03:36.060 
animal that left the egg left the egg
fragmented<00:03:34.540> and<00:03:35.140> the<00:03:35.290> snake<00:03:35.530> probably<00:03:35.950> was

00:03:36.060 --> 00:03:36.070 
fragmented and the snake probably was

00:03:36.070 --> 00:03:40.110 
fragmented and the snake probably was
attracted<00:03:36.549> to<00:03:37.830> this<00:03:38.830> egg<00:03:39.220> that<00:03:39.459> was<00:03:39.610> moving<00:03:39.970> in

00:03:40.110 --> 00:03:40.120 
attracted to this egg that was moving in

00:03:40.120 --> 00:03:41.520 
attracted to this egg that was moving in
the<00:03:40.150> hatchling<00:03:40.420> that<00:03:40.630> was<00:03:40.780> coming<00:03:41.200> out<00:03:41.320> of<00:03:41.410> it

00:03:41.520 --> 00:03:41.530 
the hatchling that was coming out of it

00:03:41.530 --> 00:03:44.280 
the hatchling that was coming out of it
and<00:03:42.150> the<00:03:43.150> moment<00:03:43.330> we<00:03:43.540> see<00:03:43.720> captured<00:03:44.110> here<00:03:44.230> in

00:03:44.280 --> 00:03:44.290 
and the moment we see captured here in

00:03:44.290 --> 00:03:45.780 
and the moment we see captured here in
the<00:03:44.380> sculpture<00:03:44.830> is<00:03:45.010> the<00:03:45.160> moment<00:03:45.340> prior<00:03:45.610> to

00:03:45.780 --> 00:03:45.790 
the sculpture is the moment prior to

00:03:45.790 --> 00:03:47.490 
the sculpture is the moment prior to
President<00:03:46.209> to<00:03:46.360> preservation<00:03:47.140> in<00:03:47.230> the<00:03:47.290> fossil

00:03:47.490 --> 00:03:47.500 
President to preservation in the fossil

00:03:47.500 --> 00:03:50.009 
President to preservation in the fossil
record<00:03:47.739> so<00:03:48.430> it's<00:03:48.580> the<00:03:48.730> moment<00:03:48.850> right<00:03:49.269> before<00:03:49.720> a

00:03:50.009 --> 00:03:50.019 
record so it's the moment right before a

00:03:50.019 --> 00:03:52.590 
record so it's the moment right before a
big<00:03:50.709> plug<00:03:51.310> of<00:03:51.519> wet<00:03:51.940> sediment<00:03:52.390> would<00:03:52.510> have

00:03:52.590 --> 00:03:52.600 
big plug of wet sediment would have

00:03:52.600 --> 00:03:55.590 
big plug of wet sediment would have
covered<00:03:52.780> this<00:03:53.019> up<00:03:53.200> and<00:03:53.549> frozen<00:03:54.549> this<00:03:54.970> instant

00:03:55.590 --> 00:03:55.600 
covered this up and frozen this instant

00:03:55.600 --> 00:03:59.009 
covered this up and frozen this instant
in<00:03:55.720> time<00:03:55.750> for<00:03:56.739> the<00:03:57.070> rest<00:03:57.220> of<00:03:57.430> us<00:03:58.209> to<00:03:58.450> enjoy<00:03:58.750> in

in time for the rest of us to enjoy in
the<00:03:59.140> 21st<00:03:59.799> century<00:04:00.209> the<00:04:01.209> fossils<00:04:01.690> of<00:04:01.959> sahajiya

and the sauropod and the eggs are now in

00:04:05.650 --> 00:04:07.380 
and the sauropod and the eggs are now in
India<00:04:05.920> we<00:04:06.130> had<00:04:06.250> a<00:04:06.280> short<00:04:06.579> term<00:04:06.760> agreement<00:04:07.239> to

the facility to go to India to study a
pretty<00:04:23.470> good<00:04:23.620> cast<00:04:23.860> of<00:04:24.220> the<00:04:24.370> specimen<00:04:24.820> here<00:04:25.000> at

00:04:25.080 --> 00:04:25.090 
pretty good cast of the specimen here at

00:04:25.090 --> 00:04:26.580 
pretty good cast of the specimen here at
Michigan<00:04:25.479> and<00:04:25.720> so<00:04:25.930> it's<00:04:26.050> really<00:04:26.350> an

incredibly<00:04:27.010> rewarding<00:04:27.310> fossil<00:04:28.150> and<00:04:28.740> it's

00:04:29.730 --> 00:04:29.740 
incredibly rewarding fossil and it's

00:04:29.740 --> 00:04:31.320 
incredibly rewarding fossil and it's
even<00:04:29.979> more<00:04:30.130> rewarding<00:04:30.280> because<00:04:30.640> how<00:04:31.000> long<00:04:31.030> it

00:04:31.320 --> 00:04:31.330 
even more rewarding because how long it

00:04:31.330 --> 00:04:34.050 
even more rewarding because how long it
took<00:04:31.450> to<00:04:31.510> find<00:04:31.750> it<00:04:31.990> and<00:04:32.229> to<00:04:32.790> to<00:04:33.790> actually

00:04:34.050 --> 00:04:34.060 
took to find it and to to actually

00:04:34.060 --> 00:04:36.330 
took to find it and to to actually
describe<00:04:34.450> it<00:04:34.630> and<00:04:34.780> so<00:04:35.020> I'm<00:04:35.560> happy<00:04:35.800> that<00:04:36.070> at<00:04:36.220> the
