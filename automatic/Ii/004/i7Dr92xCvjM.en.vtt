00:00:16.480 --> 00:00:20.340
 You can practice us a bit about 

00:00:18.430 --> 00:00:23.970
 that matter 

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:26.520
 hello I am happy to greet ago 

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:29.189
 a lot that I did not see you and much pleasure 

00:00:26.520 --> 00:00:31.560
 greet them to the general public for me 

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:33.780
 It is an honor to be with you in this 

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:36.059
 program and let me tell you that 

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:38.250
 I would really like to be president 

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:40.470
 of the republic but for a simple 

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:45.030
 I would like very much to help the 

00:00:40.470 --> 00:00:48.600
 citizens with their family with their work 

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:50.640
 with your life projects and my actions 

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:54.300
 of all life has always been the 

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:56.820
 help then is for that reason I 

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:58.560
 would love to be one day the president 

00:00:56.820 --> 00:01:00.300
 from this country 

00:00:58.560 --> 00:01:01.650
 very good then how interesting but 

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:03.990
 they talk a little bit like that 

00:01:01.650 --> 00:01:06.390
 life experiences or what things you've done 

00:01:03.990 --> 00:01:08.100
 past have motivated you to this apart from 

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:09.750
 that if you do not mention that you like to help and 

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:12.630
 all that aspect but tell us a 

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:14.010
 little bit more because I say this because we have 

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:17.850
 traveled to different parts of the 

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:19.290
 republic to cover many aspects about 

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:21.260
 the magazine that 

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:24.420
 for that reason I had the opportunity 

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:27.930
 to have conversations with a lot 

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:30.720
 people and it gives me great pleasure to listen to 

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:32.310
 people listen to what they think and in 

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:34.979
 base 

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:37.670
 what they tell me is to say that 

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:41.640
 they want more work they want more 

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:44.730
 quality of life for your family because it is 

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:47.850
 what I want to focus my government 

00:01:44.730 --> 00:01:49.890
 very well and more or less like what plans 

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:52.700
 you would have to be able to achieve all this that 

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:56.040
 you tell us the axis of my government 

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:58.730
 would base on five points the first would be 

00:01:56.040 --> 00:02:02.000
 the honesty 

00:01:58.730 --> 00:02:05.780
 because any action that should be 

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:07.580
 take from having a total responsibility 

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:09.470
 towards citizenship 

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:13.190
 the second point would be the 

00:02:09.470 --> 00:02:17.210
 responsibility because you have to have in 

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:21.050
 clear the very defined goals to be able 

00:02:17.210 --> 00:02:25.510
 get to them third point in the 

00:02:21.050 --> 00:02:27.920
 knowledge because we have many 

00:02:25.510 --> 00:02:29.930
 many many challenges that you have to 

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:31.819
 face and the only way to 

00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:34.040
 make them 

00:02:31.819 --> 00:02:36.680
 and being able to face them is with the 

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:39.260
 knowledge the fourth experience 

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:40.550
 which is very important you have to have in 

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:44.120
 Clear 

00:02:40.550 --> 00:02:47.890
 from the business vision from the 

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:51.310
 political vision how to be able to carry out 

00:02:47.890 --> 00:02:53.440
 the different actions you want 

00:02:51.310 --> 00:02:55.120
 take and the fifth point and the most 

00:02:53.440 --> 00:02:57.730
 important 

00:02:55.120 --> 00:03:01.330
 that you have a motive a motive of power 

00:02:57.730 --> 00:03:03.730
 why have the actions in this 

00:03:01.330 --> 00:03:06.370
 case my motive would be people to see it 

00:03:03.730 --> 00:03:08.830
 smile when you see them grow when you see them 

00:03:06.370 --> 00:03:12.159
 smile I think it's the most 

00:03:08.830 --> 00:03:13.400
 important to any people in this 

00:03:12.159 --> 00:03:15.829
 lifetime 

00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:17.780
 very well to life that says I smile 

00:03:15.829 --> 00:03:18.829
 I also agree with you that in 

00:03:17.780 --> 00:03:21.500
 the smile is one of the most 

00:03:18.829 --> 00:03:25.790
 important but tell me what do you think it is 

00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:29.120
 a smile full a smile full 

00:03:25.790 --> 00:03:31.760
 I think it's the one I see every day in 

00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:34.819
 this case when he sees you 

00:03:31.760 --> 00:03:36.620
 we can notice an impeccable laugh and 

00:03:34.819 --> 00:03:38.530
 it means that it is not fake and 

00:03:36.620 --> 00:03:41.989
 it really is what I want to enact 

00:03:38.530 --> 00:03:44.659
 that the smile is true that 

00:03:41.989 --> 00:03:47.310
 really people be happy that not only 

00:03:44.659 --> 00:03:50.310
 be pure visual aspects 

00:03:47.310 --> 00:03:53.160
 really what I want I want to focus 

00:03:50.310 --> 00:03:54.780
 in this in this next government that 

00:03:53.160 --> 00:03:57.540
 I am convinced that we are going to 

00:03:54.780 --> 00:04:00.330
 so well to achieve the noj to which 

00:03:57.540 --> 00:04:04.769
 may be very successful and therefore 

00:04:00.330 --> 00:04:07.080
 congratulations for this vision so 

00:04:04.769 --> 00:04:09.330
