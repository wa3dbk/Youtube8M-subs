most likely gonna go most of the way as
well<00:00:59.969> so<00:01:00.510> do<00:01:00.780> you<00:01:00.840> think<00:01:00.899> DK<00:01:01.620> is<00:01:01.680> going<00:01:01.890> to

00:01:01.939 --> 00:01:01.949

they<00:01:07.409> made<00:01:07.560> like<00:01:07.710> some<00:01:07.920> little<00:01:08.040> mistakes

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:08.970 
they made like some little mistakes

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:10.490 
they made like some little mistakes
which<00:01:09.210> they<00:01:09.450> should<00:01:09.479> not<00:01:09.900> have<00:01:10.049> done<00:01:10.290> before

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:10.500 
which they should not have done before

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:12.679
