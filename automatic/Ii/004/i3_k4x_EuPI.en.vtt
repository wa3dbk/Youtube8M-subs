like<00:01:48.659> a<00:01:48.720> baby<00:01:49.079> a<00:01:49.229> little<00:01:49.439> bit<00:01:49.649> in<00:01:49.829> I<00:01:50.610> think<00:01:50.970> I

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:51.600 
like a baby a little bit in I think I

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:53.539 
like a baby a little bit in I think I
think<00:01:52.500> it<00:01:52.560> would<00:01:52.649> only<00:01:52.740> be<00:01:53.040> like<00:01:53.250> if<00:01:53.460> you

00:01:53.539 --> 00:01:53.549 
think it would only be like if you

00:01:53.549 --> 00:01:55.130 
think it would only be like if you
measured<00:01:54.090> it's<00:01:54.240> like<00:01:54.390> maybe<00:01:54.659> two<00:01:54.930> tablespoons

00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:02.190 
wanted to tone it before I did that I

00:03:02.190 --> 00:03:04.220 
wanted to tone it before I did that I
was<00:03:02.520> going<00:03:02.700> to<00:03:02.790> die<00:03:02.910> right<00:03:02.970> over<00:03:03.420> it<00:03:03.540> but<00:03:03.780> this

00:03:08.600 --> 00:03:08.610 
going to be purple so the purple over
