feeling<00:03:39.599> too<00:03:39.989> soft<00:03:40.290> especially<00:03:40.829> when<00:03:41.489> you<00:03:41.579> go

00:03:41.780 --> 00:03:41.790 
feeling too soft especially when you go

00:03:41.790 --> 00:03:43.759 
feeling too soft especially when you go
over<00:03:41.969> Rumblers<00:03:42.450> where<00:03:43.019> you<00:03:43.109> get<00:03:43.260> a<00:03:43.290> fair<00:03:43.620> bit

00:03:43.759 --> 00:03:43.769 
over Rumblers where you get a fair bit

00:03:46.220 --> 00:03:46.230 
of movement and as a result the car even

00:03:46.230 --> 00:03:48.589 
of movement and as a result the car even
bottoms<00:03:46.739> out<00:03:46.950> when<00:03:47.430> you<00:03:47.549> go<00:03:47.760> over<00:03:48.060> the<00:03:48.090> end<00:03:48.450> of

a rumble it does get better in sport but

00:03:53.159 --> 00:03:55.220 
a rumble it does get better in sport but
you<00:03:53.489> still<00:03:53.879> have<00:03:54.150> the<00:03:54.329> movement<00:03:54.780> because<00:03:55.139> the

00:03:55.220 --> 00:03:55.230 
you still have the movement because the

00:04:42.820 --> 00:04:42.830 
now if you're sitting in that back seat

00:04:42.830 --> 00:04:44.529 
now if you're sitting in that back seat
comfortably<00:04:43.460> and<00:04:43.669> you<00:04:43.759> ask<00:04:43.940> the<00:04:44.120> driver<00:04:44.330> to

00:04:46.540 --> 00:04:46.550 
step on it be a little careful because

00:04:46.550 --> 00:04:49.809 
step on it be a little careful because
it's<00:04:47.030> a<00:04:47.120> punchy<00:04:47.690> engine<00:04:48.080> it's<00:04:48.319> quick<00:04:48.860> but<00:04:49.610> it

00:04:49.809 --> 00:04:49.819 
it's a punchy engine it's quick but it

00:04:49.819 --> 00:04:52.210 
it's a punchy engine it's quick but it
must<00:04:50.240> the<00:04:50.569> power<00:04:50.810> so<00:04:51.259> well<00:04:51.530> it<00:04:51.740> does<00:04:51.949> it<00:04:52.099> in<00:04:52.190> a

00:04:52.210 --> 00:04:52.220 
must the power so well it does it in a

must the power so well it does it in a
very<00:04:52.400> graceful<00:04:52.880> linear<00:04:53.780> manner<00:04:54.080> that<00:04:54.919> often

00:04:55.450 --> 00:04:55.460 
very graceful linear manner that often

00:04:55.460 --> 00:04:57.540 
very graceful linear manner that often
you<00:04:55.580> won't<00:04:55.819> know<00:04:55.940> how<00:04:56.270> quick<00:04:56.599> he<00:04:56.840> is<00:04:56.870> going

00:04:57.540 --> 00:04:57.550 
you won't know how quick he is going

00:04:57.550 --> 00:05:00.159 
you won't know how quick he is going
there's<00:04:58.550> a<00:04:58.610> nice<00:04:58.940> surge<00:04:59.300> of<00:04:59.449> power<00:04:59.660> that<00:04:59.930> comes
