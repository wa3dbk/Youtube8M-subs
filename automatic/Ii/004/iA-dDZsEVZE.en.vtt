00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:03.470 

I've<00:00:00.750> had<00:00:00.900> a<00:00:00.930> couple<00:00:01.079> requests<00:00:02.000> to<00:00:03.000> show<00:00:03.210> how<00:00:03.449> I

00:00:03.470 --> 00:00:03.480 
I've had a couple requests to show how I

00:00:03.480 --> 00:00:06.320 
I've had a couple requests to show how I
set<00:00:03.959> up<00:00:03.990> my<00:00:04.110> CB<00:00:04.620> antennas<00:00:05.160> you<00:00:05.910> can<00:00:06.060> see<00:00:06.210> I've

00:00:06.320 --> 00:00:06.330 
set up my CB antennas you can see I've

00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:08.120 
set up my CB antennas you can see I've
got<00:00:06.450> dual<00:00:06.750> whips<00:00:07.080> one<00:00:07.379> right<00:00:07.589> there<00:00:07.830> on<00:00:07.980> the

00:00:08.120 --> 00:00:08.130 
got dual whips one right there on the

00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:09.530 
got dual whips one right there on the
passenger<00:00:08.580> side<00:00:08.730> and<00:00:08.849> one<00:00:08.970> right<00:00:09.120> there<00:00:09.330> over

00:00:09.530 --> 00:00:09.540 
passenger side and one right there over

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:11.810 
passenger side and one right there over
on<00:00:09.599> the<00:00:09.719> driver's<00:00:10.050> side<00:00:10.309> right<00:00:11.309> now<00:00:11.429> only<00:00:11.639> the

00:00:11.810 --> 00:00:11.820 
on the driver's side right now only the

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:13.850 
on the driver's side right now only the
one<00:00:12.030> over<00:00:12.269> here<00:00:12.509> on<00:00:12.660> the<00:00:13.230> passenger<00:00:13.620> side<00:00:13.769> is

00:00:13.850 --> 00:00:13.860 
one over here on the passenger side is

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:16.760 
one over here on the passenger side is
hooked<00:00:14.040> up<00:00:14.160> I<00:00:14.400> didn't<00:00:15.210> buy<00:00:15.330> the<00:00:15.389> the<00:00:15.929> coax<00:00:16.529> it

00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:16.770 
hooked up I didn't buy the the coax it

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:18.590 
hooked up I didn't buy the the coax it
was<00:00:16.859> more<00:00:17.010> expensive<00:00:17.250> for<00:00:17.789> a<00:00:17.820> dual<00:00:18.000> setup<00:00:18.390> and

00:00:18.590 --> 00:00:18.600 
was more expensive for a dual setup and

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:20.599 
was more expensive for a dual setup and
really<00:00:19.260> I<00:00:19.289> don't<00:00:19.410> need<00:00:19.710> it<00:00:19.890> um<00:00:20.010> the<00:00:20.490> only

00:00:20.599 --> 00:00:20.609 
really I don't need it um the only

00:00:20.609 --> 00:00:23.000 
really I don't need it um the only
reason<00:00:21.000> that<00:00:21.210> you<00:00:22.050> see<00:00:22.260> like<00:00:22.410> the<00:00:22.560> big<00:00:22.710> trucks

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:23.010 
reason that you see like the big trucks

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:25.009 
reason that you see like the big trucks
out<00:00:23.250> on<00:00:23.279> the<00:00:23.490> highway<00:00:23.789> with<00:00:24.029> dual<00:00:24.480> whips<00:00:24.810> is

00:00:25.009 --> 00:00:25.019 
out on the highway with dual whips is

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:28.339 
out on the highway with dual whips is
because<00:00:25.350> the<00:00:26.300> the<00:00:27.300> top<00:00:27.480> of<00:00:27.630> the<00:00:27.689> cab<00:00:27.900> actually

00:00:28.339 --> 00:00:28.349 
because the the top of the cab actually

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:30.050 
because the the top of the cab actually
goes<00:00:28.470> above<00:00:28.830> the<00:00:29.189> tip<00:00:29.400> of<00:00:29.519> the<00:00:29.609> antenna<00:00:29.939> and

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:30.060 
goes above the tip of the antenna and

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:32.690 
goes above the tip of the antenna and
that<00:00:30.179> restricts<00:00:30.859> your<00:00:31.859> broadcast<00:00:32.309> range<00:00:32.520> it

00:00:32.690 --> 00:00:32.700 
that restricts your broadcast range it

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:34.729 
that restricts your broadcast range it
won't<00:00:32.910> it<00:00:33.120> won't<00:00:33.300> broadcast<00:00:33.870> side-to-side<00:00:34.410> it

00:00:34.729 --> 00:00:34.739 
won't it won't broadcast side-to-side it

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:36.830 
won't it won't broadcast side-to-side it
will<00:00:34.829> only<00:00:34.920> go<00:00:35.130> forwards<00:00:35.579> if<00:00:35.850> the<00:00:36.510> top<00:00:36.660> of<00:00:36.780> the

00:00:36.830 --> 00:00:36.840 
will only go forwards if the top of the

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:38.420 
will only go forwards if the top of the
truck<00:00:37.050> is<00:00:37.200> actually<00:00:37.590> blocking<00:00:37.800> the<00:00:38.129> tip<00:00:38.309> of

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:38.430 
truck is actually blocking the tip of

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:43.459 
truck is actually blocking the tip of
the<00:00:38.579> antenna<00:00:39.360> it<00:00:40.320> just<00:00:41.070> restricts<00:00:41.520> the<00:00:42.469> radio

00:00:43.459 --> 00:00:43.469 
the antenna it just restricts the radio

00:00:43.469 --> 00:00:46.670 
the antenna it just restricts the radio
signal<00:00:44.870> so<00:00:45.870> come<00:00:46.050> over<00:00:46.079> here<00:00:46.410> I'll<00:00:46.500> show<00:00:46.530> you

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:46.680 
signal so come over here I'll show you

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:50.060 
signal so come over here I'll show you
how<00:00:46.800> I<00:00:46.920> hook<00:00:47.670> this<00:00:47.879> up<00:00:48.079> like<00:00:49.079> I<00:00:49.230> said<00:00:49.469> only<00:00:49.980> the

00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:50.070 
how I hook this up like I said only the

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:52.010 
how I hook this up like I said only the
one<00:00:50.219> over<00:00:50.520> here<00:00:50.789> on<00:00:50.969> the<00:00:51.180> passenger<00:00:51.660> side<00:00:51.870> is

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:52.020 
one over here on the passenger side is

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:53.930 
one over here on the passenger side is
actually<00:00:52.199> hooked<00:00:52.469> up<00:00:52.620> that<00:00:53.340> one<00:00:53.520> over<00:00:53.699> there

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:53.940 
actually hooked up that one over there

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:56.869 
actually hooked up that one over there
Oh<00:00:54.110> sounds<00:00:55.110> kind<00:00:55.320> of<00:00:55.379> glaring<00:00:55.980> it<00:00:56.219> out<00:00:56.340> that

00:00:56.869 --> 00:00:56.879 
Oh sounds kind of glaring it out that

00:00:56.879 --> 00:00:58.099 
Oh sounds kind of glaring it out that
one<00:00:57.000> over<00:00:57.180> here<00:00:57.360> on<00:00:57.449> the<00:00:57.539> driver<00:00:57.750> side<00:00:57.840> is

00:00:58.099 --> 00:00:58.109 
one over here on the driver side is

00:00:58.109 --> 00:01:01.819 
one over here on the driver side is
really<00:00:58.350> there<00:00:58.500> just<00:00:58.800> for<00:00:58.920> looks<00:00:59.329> I<00:01:00.680> could<00:01:01.680> take

00:01:01.819 --> 00:01:01.829 
really there just for looks I could take

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:04.369 
really there just for looks I could take
it<00:01:01.859> off<00:01:02.010> if<00:01:02.160> I<00:01:02.219> wanted<00:01:02.489> to<00:01:02.670> but<00:01:03.480> I<00:01:03.719> like<00:01:04.199> the

00:01:04.369 --> 00:01:04.379 
it off if I wanted to but I like the

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:05.899 
it off if I wanted to but I like the
look<00:01:04.530> of<00:01:04.650> duel<00:01:04.830> whips<00:01:05.129> I<00:01:05.369> think<00:01:05.610> it<00:01:05.700> makes<00:01:05.790> the

00:01:05.899 --> 00:01:05.909 
look of duel whips I think it makes the

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:10.340 
look of duel whips I think it makes the
truck<00:01:06.090> look<00:01:06.270> a<00:01:06.330> little<00:01:06.450> meaner<00:01:08.900> so<00:01:09.900> all<00:01:10.080> I<00:01:10.110> did

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:10.350 
truck look a little meaner so all I did

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:14.620 
truck look a little meaner so all I did
let's<00:01:11.010> see<00:01:11.130> I<00:01:11.159> can<00:01:11.340> get<00:01:11.430> this<00:01:11.640> the<00:01:12.270> cover<00:01:12.630> here

I<00:01:20.100> just<00:01:20.130> took<00:01:20.400> the<00:01:20.549> mount<00:01:20.759> drilled<00:01:21.479> two<00:01:21.659> holes

00:01:21.940 --> 00:01:21.950 
I just took the mount drilled two holes

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:25.600 
I just took the mount drilled two holes
straight<00:01:22.950> into<00:01:23.280> the<00:01:23.430> top<00:01:24.240> of<00:01:24.270> the<00:01:24.420> box<00:01:24.630> here

00:01:28.999 --> 00:01:29.009 
that they don't want to be drilling

00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:30.410 
that they don't want to be drilling
permanent<00:01:29.400> holes<00:01:29.520> in<00:01:29.640> their<00:01:29.729> trucks<00:01:29.970> I<00:01:30.150> didn't

00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:30.420 
permanent holes in their trucks I didn't

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:32.450 
permanent holes in their trucks I didn't
really<00:01:30.600> care<00:01:30.810> I<00:01:31.049> just<00:01:31.890> drilled<00:01:32.250> two<00:01:32.430> holes

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:32.460 
really care I just drilled two holes

time<00:03:56.769> I<00:03:56.799> use<00:03:57.040> it<00:03:57.069> but<00:03:57.370> I<00:03:57.750> haven't<00:03:58.750> had<00:03:58.840> any

SWR<00:04:01.150> is<00:04:01.269> too<00:04:01.419> awful<00:04:01.750> bad<00:04:01.900> with<00:04:02.680> this<00:04:02.859> setup<00:04:03.900> but

00:04:04.890 --> 00:04:04.900 
SWR is too awful bad with this setup but

00:04:04.900 --> 00:04:07.630
