00:00:11.429 --> 00:00:15.080
 locker rooms go there for only a second 

00:00:15.830 --> 00:00:22.140
 it is the salad in the background people 

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:23.789
 People are loading 

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:25.529

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:27.330
 speak or hear i want you 

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:29.070

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:45.809
 had hung up that he was the same 

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:47.160
 but that is not necessary 

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:49.230
 However, that is necessary, I will be very happy 

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:50.610
 much calmer what are you telling there 

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:52.920

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:56.730
 Much time will pass tomorrow 

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:58.469
 let me see it was almost not not 

00:00:56.730 --> 00:00:59.730
 to ok it is important not to touch 

00:00:58.469 --> 00:01:01.710
 I'm a dancer that's normal 

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:03.629
 I know where that comes from, I have mine 

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:07.129
 The ankle often sprained when 

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:07.129
 playing football as apply 

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:16.550
 and who is the pain after I have 

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:16.550
 I know that from me 

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:22.540

 So see no no go please good then 

00:01:25.570 --> 00:01:28.000
 I'll go but before I want to 

00:01:26.710 --> 00:01:30.960
 is to know why you did this accident 

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:33.490
 How did this happen 

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:34.690
 I have seen me with leon if you 

00:01:33.490 --> 00:01:36.250
 seen me you have you ask 

00:01:34.690 --> 00:01:38.830
 physically wants to know if you like me 

00:01:36.250 --> 00:01:40.150
 I did not lied to that 

00:01:38.830 --> 00:01:41.670
 talking to leon does a lot more here 

00:01:40.150 --> 00:01:43.810
 would be as the foot believes that at least 

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:44.440
 I know what you had was something 

00:01:43.810 --> 00:01:46.510
 special 

00:01:44.440 --> 00:01:47.680
 you said that right what we did 

00:01:46.510 --> 00:01:49.030
 and I do not feel well 

00:01:47.680 --> 00:01:50.500
 if i ask about the past 

00:01:49.030 --> 00:01:51.850
 violet you can not allow that 

00:01:50.500 --> 00:01:53.800
 he hurts you that she does not 

00:01:51.850 --> 00:01:55.530
 I fell over with my foot 

00:01:53.800 --> 00:01:59.940
 that was an accident that was an accident 

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:59.940
 And you were also an accident 

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:09.789
 is violetta what is comforting you have 

00:02:08.619 --> 00:02:11.380
 I want to know that I do not know 

00:02:09.789 --> 00:02:12.910
 I did not do anything that was 

00:02:11.380 --> 00:02:14.200
 All the leons are guilty they have become 

00:02:12.910 --> 00:02:15.850
 she argues and she is down the stairs 

00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:16.570
 I like it but I have absolutely nothing 

00:02:15.850 --> 00:02:18.610
 to do with 

00:02:16.570 --> 00:02:24.070
 Violetta has learned that leon one 

00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:29.709
 new girlfriend has how are you nothing 

00:02:24.070 --> 00:02:30.730
 Thank you to bring home 

00:02:29.709 --> 00:02:33.190
 Thanks a lot for being my enemies 

00:02:30.730 --> 00:02:34.120
 helped to slowly say its slow 

00:02:33.190 --> 00:02:38.200
 slowly 

00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:39.640

00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:41.350
 not a really good year i am 

00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:42.489
 bitterly afterwards no one is telling me 

00:02:41.350 --> 00:02:43.570
 but I'm worried violet 

00:02:42.489 --> 00:02:45.519
 Worry when I see that it is not 

00:02:43.570 --> 00:02:48.880
 well and you are sad what is going on 

00:02:45.519 --> 00:02:52.880
 Well, I 'm not talking to you 

00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:54.830
 That's it about innovation 

00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:59.660
 whatever it is you can do me 

00:02:54.830 --> 00:03:01.700
 trust what's going on has a new one 

00:02:59.660 --> 00:03:04.150
 girlfriend 

00:03:01.700 --> 00:03:05.930
 spring 

00:03:04.150 --> 00:03:10.050
 Yes 

00:03:05.930 --> 00:03:11.910
 formerly there was only him and me 

00:03:10.050 --> 00:03:14.060
 how should I explain that it has become 

00:03:11.910 --> 00:03:15.330
 felt like in love the 

00:03:14.060 --> 00:03:17.220
 was unique 

00:03:15.330 --> 00:03:19.290
 if nothing can us and nobody 

00:03:17.220 --> 00:03:21.690
 can suddenly break apart 

00:03:19.290 --> 00:03:23.130
 he had to argue with me 

00:03:21.690 --> 00:03:24.750
 It's the best we know each other 

00:03:23.130 --> 00:03:26.970
 disconnect and as is closed 

00:03:24.750 --> 00:03:28.020
 I also realized that he was 

00:03:26.970 --> 00:03:29.190
 maybe in another girl 

00:03:28.020 --> 00:03:31.580
 in love but I never thought 

00:03:29.190 --> 00:03:36.330
 that's the way to do it 

00:03:31.580 --> 00:03:37.170
 yes yes i know how i understand this 

00:03:36.330 --> 00:03:38.580
 is strange 

00:03:37.170 --> 00:03:40.530
 I do not know why I give you all this 

00:03:38.580 --> 00:03:42.840
 but tell me I am your dad I have 

00:03:40.530 --> 00:03:44.070
 always an open ear for you me 

00:03:42.840 --> 00:03:46.220
 i wish i could do something that the 

00:03:44.070 --> 00:03:49.710
 helping to get over it though 

00:03:46.220 --> 00:03:51.360
 That's an experience that had to do 

00:03:49.710 --> 00:03:58.100
 good is that I'm behind me 

00:03:51.360 --> 00:03:58.100
