he's got 90 strength he is mighty is my
favorite<00:00:37.380> strike<00:00:37.680> or<00:00:37.890> I've<00:00:38.010> used<00:00:38.250> on<00:00:38.489> this

favorite strike or I've used on this

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:40.700 
favorite strike or I've used on this
game<00:00:38.910> I<00:00:39.120> would<00:00:39.239> follow<00:00:39.600> recommend<00:00:40.230> trying<00:00:40.500> him

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:40.710 
game I would follow recommend trying him

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:42.410 
game I would follow recommend trying him
out<00:00:40.860> or<00:00:41.100> you<00:00:41.190> probably<00:00:41.520> even<00:00:41.670> have<00:00:41.969> tried<00:00:42.180> him

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:42.420 
out or you probably even have tried him

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:44.630 
out or you probably even have tried him
out<00:00:42.510> already<00:00:42.660> as<00:00:43.469> the<00:00:43.649> second<00:00:44.070> striker<00:00:44.370> then

00:00:44.630 --> 00:00:44.640 
out already as the second striker then

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:47.479 
out already as the second striker then
you<00:00:44.789> probably<00:00:45.059> seen<00:00:45.390> we<00:00:45.719> got<00:00:45.899> Lukaku<00:00:46.559> purely

00:00:47.479 --> 00:00:47.489 
you probably seen we got Lukaku purely

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:49.369 
you probably seen we got Lukaku purely
because<00:00:47.670> of<00:00:47.850> the<00:00:48.000> chemistry<00:00:48.629> and<00:00:48.809> they<00:00:49.200> used

00:00:49.369 --> 00:00:49.379 
because of the chemistry and they used

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:52.130 
because of the chemistry and they used
them<00:00:49.680> before<00:00:50.210> and<00:00:51.210> I<00:00:51.300> didn't<00:00:51.539> really<00:00:51.570> like<00:00:51.930> him

00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:52.140 
them before and I didn't really like him

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:53.630 
them before and I didn't really like him
so<00:00:52.320> I<00:00:52.350> wanted<00:00:52.620> give<00:00:52.800> him<00:00:52.949> another<00:00:53.160> go<00:00:53.399> and<00:00:53.550> he

00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:53.640 
so I wanted give him another go and he

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:55.639 
so I wanted give him another go and he
has<00:00:53.760> actually<00:00:54.360> improved<00:00:54.480> a<00:00:54.989> bit<00:00:55.020> it's<00:00:55.500> good

00:00:55.639 --> 00:00:55.649 
has actually improved a bit it's good

00:00:55.649 --> 00:00:58.220 
has actually improved a bit it's good

I<00:01:02.280> don't<00:01:02.489> know<00:01:02.579> where<00:01:02.760> he's<00:01:03.000> going<00:01:03.149> to<00:01:03.300> go<00:01:03.420> up

00:01:03.529 --> 00:01:03.539 
I don't know where he's going to go up

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:05.450 
I don't know where he's going to go up
these<00:01:03.809> non<00:01:04.049> packs<00:01:04.350> at<00:01:04.589> the<00:01:04.619> moment<00:01:05.040> it's

00:01:05.450 --> 00:01:05.460 
these non packs at the moment it's

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:08.210 
these non packs at the moment it's
informed<00:01:06.060> car<00:01:06.270> days<00:01:06.479> but<00:01:07.320> I<00:01:07.470> bought<00:01:07.770> a<00:01:07.799> few<00:01:08.100> of

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:08.220 
informed car days but I bought a few of

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:09.710 
informed car days but I bought a few of
them<00:01:08.369> to<00:01:08.549> invest<00:01:08.670> and<00:01:09.150> probably<00:01:09.479> should<00:01:09.659> have

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:09.720 
them to invest and probably should have

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:11.240 
them to invest and probably should have
sold<00:01:09.930> them<00:01:10.110> yesterday<00:01:10.320> when<00:01:10.740> they<00:01:10.890> were<00:01:10.920> going

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:11.250 
sold them yesterday when they were going

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:13.190 
sold them yesterday when they were going
for<00:01:11.280> loads<00:01:11.610> but<00:01:11.880> my<00:01:12.119> mistake<00:01:12.630> I<00:01:12.840> didn't

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:13.200 
for loads but my mistake I didn't

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:15.200 
for loads but my mistake I didn't
hopefully<00:01:13.470> they<00:01:13.799> go<00:01:13.950> up<00:01:14.070> this<00:01:14.640> quick<00:01:14.939> look<00:01:15.090> at

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:15.210 
hopefully they go up this quick look at

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:18.050 
hopefully they go up this quick look at
Ben<00:01:15.360> take<00:01:15.570> his<00:01:15.750> price<00:01:15.990> he<00:01:16.229> cast<00:01:16.710> me<00:01:16.799> 16.5<00:01:17.790> k

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:18.060 
Ben take his price he cast me 16.5 k

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:21.200 
Ben take his price he cast me 16.5 k
folly<00:01:18.360> were<00:01:18.540> kind<00:01:18.960> to<00:01:19.080> my<00:01:19.290> opinion<00:01:19.680> as<00:01:19.860> a<00:01:20.210> cam

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:21.210 
folly were kind to my opinion as a cam

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:23.450 
folly were kind to my opinion as a cam
now<00:01:21.479> we<00:01:22.259> have<00:01:22.409> Cuttino<00:01:22.890> i<00:01:22.920> could<00:01:23.189> have<00:01:23.280> gone

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:23.460 
now we have Cuttino i could have gone

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:25.850 
now we have Cuttino i could have gone
with<00:01:23.700> Oscar<00:01:24.540> but<00:01:24.720> purely<00:01:25.049> chose<00:01:25.470> Katina

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:25.860 
with Oscar but purely chose Katina

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:28.730 
with Oscar but purely chose Katina
because<00:01:26.220> he's<00:01:26.450> stronger<00:01:27.450> and<00:01:27.720> he's<00:01:28.470> got

00:01:28.730 --> 00:01:28.740 
because he's stronger and he's got

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:30.920 
because he's stronger and he's got
really<00:01:29.009> good<00:01:29.189> stats<00:01:29.640> 83<00:01:30.270> piece<00:01:30.509> of<00:01:30.659> ink<00:01:30.810> it's

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:30.930 
really good stats 83 piece of ink it's

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:33.499 
really good stats 83 piece of ink it's
got<00:01:31.079> something<00:01:31.259> like<00:01:31.409> 90<00:01:31.860> acceleration<00:01:32.579> 69<00:01:33.240> 2

00:01:33.499 --> 00:01:33.509 
got something like 90 acceleration 69 2

00:01:33.509 --> 00:01:36.679 
got something like 90 acceleration 69 2
and<00:01:33.720> seems<00:01:33.900> much<00:01:34.170> higher<00:01:34.439> 78<00:01:35.400> passing<00:01:35.909> an<00:01:36.119> 88

00:01:36.679 --> 00:01:36.689 
and seems much higher 78 passing an 88

00:01:36.689 --> 00:01:39.080 
and seems much higher 78 passing an 88
dribbling<00:01:37.200> he's<00:01:37.920> also<00:01:38.159> for<00:01:38.549> such<00:01:38.820> skill<00:01:39.060> I

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:39.090 
dribbling he's also for such skill I

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:41.030 
dribbling he's also for such skill I
think<00:01:39.390> he's<00:01:39.479> got<00:01:39.630> a<00:01:39.689> full<00:01:39.930> star<00:01:40.229> week<00:01:40.439> but<00:01:40.710> he

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:41.040 
think he's got a full star week but he

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:42.499 
think he's got a full star week but he
cost<00:01:41.280> me<00:01:41.400> twelve<00:01:41.729> thousand<00:01:42.180> seven<00:01:42.450> hundred

00:01:42.499 --> 00:01:42.509 
cost me twelve thousand seven hundred

00:01:42.509 --> 00:01:44.359 
cost me twelve thousand seven hundred
fifty<00:01:42.869> coins<00:01:43.290> for<00:01:43.500> a<00:01:43.530> thing<00:01:43.740> he's<00:01:43.920> gone<00:01:44.130> down

00:01:44.359 --> 00:01:44.369 
fifty coins for a thing he's gone down

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:47.270 
fifty coins for a thing he's gone down
