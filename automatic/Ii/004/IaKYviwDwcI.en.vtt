00:01:22.149 --> 00:01:28.522
I've found you my dad, a statue that lies here

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:34.861
The world gone mad, and everyone were without peace

00:01:34.862 --> 00:01:41.368
I will continue, the chaos you wanted to created

00:01:41.668 --> 00:01:52.913
You are my dad Discord, and I am just like you

00:02:06.693 --> 00:02:13.066
Don't cry my love, your father hasn't lost his furore

00:02:13.166 --> 00:02:19.506
And when I escape, we can create more terror

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:26.113
There won't be salvation, in my sweet flood

00:02:26.413 --> 00:02:38.091
I am your dad Discord, and I am just like you

00:02:51.505 --> 00:02:58.011
Remember that one time, the game we went to see

00:02:58.012 --> 00:03:00.947
I got my mark...

00:03:01.214 --> 00:03:04.351
...And this I remember quite well.

00:03:04.484 --> 00:03:10.891
Pitches from beyond, no one was left from the normals

00:03:10.957 --> 00:03:23.136
I am your dad Discord, and I am just like you

00:03:36.483 --> 00:03:42.656
How is good to see you, my daughter I won't forget you

00:03:42.689 --> 00:03:45.492
Stay close to me...

00:03:45.859 --> 00:03:49.162
...Doesn't matter what will be the end

00:03:49.229 --> 00:03:55.769
With imagination, we will make destruction

00:03:55.836 --> 00:04:08.415
You are my daughter Screwball, and I'm getting out of here
