leap<00:03:10.420> that<00:03:10.720> um<00:03:11.020> it's<00:03:11.950> pretty<00:03:12.220> cool<00:03:12.400> I<00:03:12.640> must<00:03:12.970> say

00:03:13.550 --> 00:03:13.560 
leap that um it's pretty cool I must say

00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:15.840 
leap that um it's pretty cool I must say
so<00:03:14.560> going<00:03:14.860> back<00:03:15.040> into<00:03:15.250> the<00:03:15.400> faded

00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:15.850 
so going back into the faded

00:03:15.850 --> 00:03:18.270 
so going back into the faded
illumination<00:03:16.480> we<00:03:16.690> now<00:03:16.840> have<00:03:17.110> 50<00:03:17.680> members<00:03:17.860> so<00:03:18.250> I

00:03:18.270 --> 00:03:18.280 
illumination we now have 50 members so I

00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:22.410 
illumination we now have 50 members so I
