00:03:47.230 --> 00:03:48.630 
a narrow glass to support it and if it's
too<00:03:47.440> soft<00:03:47.709> either<00:03:47.950> you<00:03:48.130> can<00:03:48.280> show<00:03:48.489> the

00:03:48.630 --> 00:03:48.640 
too soft either you can show the

00:03:48.640 --> 00:03:51.890 
too soft either you can show the
buttercream<00:03:49.060> or<00:03:49.450> you<00:03:49.720> can<00:03:49.870> chill<00:03:50.049> your<00:03:50.230> hand

00:03:51.890 --> 00:03:51.900 
buttercream or you can chill your hand

00:03:51.900 --> 00:03:55.740 
buttercream or you can chill your hand
so<00:03:52.900> the<00:03:53.860> first<00:03:54.130> thing<00:03:54.340> to<00:03:54.370> make<00:03:54.640> sure<00:03:54.910> is<00:03:55.690> that

00:03:55.740 --> 00:03:55.750 
so the first thing to make sure is that

00:03:55.750 --> 00:03:58.229 
so the first thing to make sure is that
I<00:03:56.320> used<00:03:56.860> my<00:03:57.010> bench<00:03:57.220> scraper<00:03:57.459> for<00:03:57.700> this<00:03:58.000> but<00:03:58.209> you

00:03:58.229 --> 00:03:58.239 
I used my bench scraper for this but you

00:03:58.239 --> 00:04:00.860 
I used my bench scraper for this but you
can<00:03:58.299> use<00:03:58.570> the<00:03:58.690> side<00:03:58.900> of<00:03:58.930> your<00:03:59.079> hand<00:03:59.410> as<00:03:59.590> well

00:04:00.860 --> 00:04:00.870 
can use the side of your hand as well

00:04:00.870 --> 00:04:03.449 
can use the side of your hand as well
make<00:04:01.870> sure<00:04:02.079> that<00:04:02.320> all<00:04:02.560> the<00:04:02.739> frosting<00:04:03.220> all<00:04:03.370> the

00:04:03.449 --> 00:04:03.459 
make sure that all the frosting all the

00:04:03.459 --> 00:04:06.780 
make sure that all the frosting all the
buttercream<00:04:03.850> is<00:04:04.739> down<00:04:05.739> toward<00:04:06.220> the<00:04:06.310> front<00:04:06.609> of

00:04:06.780 --> 00:04:06.790 
buttercream is down toward the front of

00:04:06.790 --> 00:04:09.780 
buttercream is down toward the front of
the<00:04:06.910> tube<00:04:07.950> because<00:04:08.950> otherwise<00:04:09.340> you're<00:04:09.640> in<00:04:09.670> the

00:04:09.780 --> 00:04:09.790 
the tube because otherwise you're in the

00:04:09.790 --> 00:04:11.130 
the tube because otherwise you're in the
middle<00:04:09.970> of<00:04:10.000> piping<00:04:10.269> a<00:04:10.420> beautiful<00:04:10.780> design<00:04:11.109> and

00:04:11.130 --> 00:04:11.140 
middle of piping a beautiful design and

00:04:11.140 --> 00:04:13.710 
middle of piping a beautiful design and
poof<00:04:11.590> the<00:04:11.859> air<00:04:12.010> that<00:04:12.370> in<00:04:12.489> the<00:04:12.579> middle<00:04:12.850> makes<00:04:13.630> a

00:04:13.710 --> 00:04:13.720 
poof the air that in the middle makes a

00:04:13.720 --> 00:04:16.229 
poof the air that in the middle makes a
big<00:04:13.900> hole<00:04:14.140> it's<00:04:14.859> hard<00:04:15.160> to<00:04:15.280> remove<00:04:15.519> once<00:04:15.940> you<00:04:16.060> do

00:04:16.229 --> 00:04:16.239 
big hole it's hard to remove once you do

00:04:16.239 --> 00:04:19.830 
big hole it's hard to remove once you do
it<00:04:16.390> and<00:04:17.400> then<00:04:18.400> I<00:04:18.669> take<00:04:18.880> it<00:04:19.030> between<00:04:19.180> my<00:04:19.510> thumb

00:04:19.830 --> 00:04:19.840 
it and then I take it between my thumb

00:04:19.840 --> 00:04:21.449 
it and then I take it between my thumb
and<00:04:20.080> the<00:04:20.530> rest<00:04:20.680> of<00:04:20.830> my<00:04:20.950> finger<00:04:21.250> like<00:04:21.430> a

00:04:21.449 --> 00:04:21.459 
and the rest of my finger like a

00:04:21.459 --> 00:04:23.879 
and the rest of my finger like a
pinching<00:04:22.060> motion<00:04:22.120> and<00:04:22.810> twist<00:04:23.380> it

00:04:23.879 --> 00:04:23.889 
pinching motion and twist it

00:04:23.889 --> 00:04:24.960 
pinching motion and twist it
because<00:04:24.129> you<00:04:24.250> know<00:04:24.340> what<00:04:24.460> happens<00:04:24.789> if<00:04:24.939> you

00:04:24.960 --> 00:04:24.970 
because you know what happens if you

00:04:24.970 --> 00:04:27.149 
because you know what happens if you
don't<00:04:25.210> do<00:04:25.389> it<00:04:25.720> it<00:04:25.960> all<00:04:26.110> starts<00:04:26.590> coming<00:04:26.860> up<00:04:27.009> so

00:04:27.149 --> 00:04:27.159 
don't do it it all starts coming up so

00:04:27.159 --> 00:04:28.350 
don't do it it all starts coming up so
you're<00:04:27.280> piping<00:04:27.669> down<00:04:27.879> and<00:04:28.180> all<00:04:28.240> of<00:04:28.300> a<00:04:28.330> sudden

00:04:28.350 --> 00:04:28.360 
you're piping down and all of a sudden

00:04:28.360 --> 00:04:31.770 
you're piping down and all of a sudden
you<00:04:28.629> see<00:04:28.840> the<00:04:29.409> top<00:04:29.860> of<00:04:29.889> it<00:04:30.189> is<00:04:30.310> coming<00:04:30.490> up<00:04:30.819> keep

00:04:31.770 --> 00:04:31.780 
you see the top of it is coming up keep

00:04:31.780 --> 00:04:34.409 
you see the top of it is coming up keep
piping<00:04:32.319> I<00:04:32.560> do<00:04:33.250> it<00:04:33.460> right<00:04:33.580> on<00:04:33.610> my<00:04:33.699> spatula<00:04:34.300> to

00:04:34.409 --> 00:04:34.419 
piping I do it right on my spatula to

00:04:34.419 --> 00:04:35.999 
piping I do it right on my spatula to
see<00:04:34.569> how<00:04:34.689> it's<00:04:34.840> gonna<00:04:34.900> come<00:04:35.020> out<00:04:35.349> and<00:04:35.530> now<00:04:35.979> I

00:04:35.999 --> 00:04:36.009 
see how it's gonna come out and now I

00:04:36.009 --> 00:04:37.439 
see how it's gonna come out and now I
have<00:04:36.310> I<00:04:36.460> know<00:04:36.520> I<00:04:36.639> have<00:04:36.879> a<00:04:36.909> really<00:04:37.210> nice

00:04:37.439 --> 00:04:37.449 
have I know I have a really nice

00:04:37.449 --> 00:04:41.339 
have I know I have a really nice
consistency<00:04:38.370> so<00:04:39.370> I<00:04:39.639> use<00:04:40.210> a<00:04:40.240> fairly<00:04:40.599> large<00:04:40.900> star

00:04:41.339 --> 00:04:41.349 
consistency so I use a fairly large star

00:04:41.349 --> 00:04:43.770 
consistency so I use a fairly large star
tip<00:04:41.550> because<00:04:42.550> it's<00:04:42.729> a<00:04:42.789> large<00:04:43.030> cake<00:04:43.419> and<00:04:43.719> the

00:04:43.770 --> 00:04:43.780 
tip because it's a large cake and the

00:04:43.780 --> 00:04:46.770 
tip because it's a large cake and the
nuts<00:04:44.020> are<00:04:44.259> coarse<00:04:44.710> and<00:04:45.069> i'm<00:04:45.969> chilling<00:04:46.360> down<00:04:46.509> my

00:04:46.770 --> 00:04:46.780 
nuts are coarse and i'm chilling down my

00:04:46.780 --> 00:04:49.260 
nuts are coarse and i'm chilling down my
hand<00:04:47.080> just<00:04:48.009> for<00:04:48.189> a<00:04:48.250> few<00:04:48.370> seconds<00:04:48.819> and<00:04:49.060> if<00:04:49.180> I'm

00:04:49.260 --> 00:04:49.270 
hand just for a few seconds and if I'm

00:04:49.270 --> 00:04:51.300 
hand just for a few seconds and if I'm
doing<00:04:49.389> something<00:04:49.689> really<00:04:49.960> elaborate<00:04:50.590> I<00:04:50.770> keep

00:04:51.300 --> 00:04:51.310 
doing something really elaborate I keep

00:04:51.310 --> 00:04:53.129 
doing something really elaborate I keep
chilling<00:04:51.699> at<00:04:51.789> every<00:04:52.060> few<00:04:52.300> decorations<00:04:52.780> that

00:04:53.129 --> 00:04:53.139 
chilling at every few decorations that

00:04:53.139 --> 00:04:54.779 
chilling at every few decorations that
lasts<00:04:53.530> for<00:04:53.740> a<00:04:53.770> while<00:04:53.979> that<00:04:54.159> makes<00:04:54.280> a<00:04:54.430> huge

00:04:54.779 --> 00:04:54.789 
lasts for a while that makes a huge

00:04:54.789 --> 00:04:56.520 
lasts for a while that makes a huge
difference<00:04:54.849> especially<00:04:55.780> if<00:04:56.139> you<00:04:56.199> have<00:04:56.289> warm

00:04:56.520 --> 00:04:56.530 
difference especially if you have warm

00:04:56.530 --> 00:04:59.520 
difference especially if you have warm
hands<00:04:56.830> the<00:04:57.759> easiest<00:04:58.240> kind<00:04:58.509> of<00:04:58.659> decoration<00:04:59.110> is

00:04:59.520 --> 00:04:59.530 
hands the easiest kind of decoration is

00:04:59.530 --> 00:05:03.270 
hands the easiest kind of decoration is
by<00:05:00.370> squeezing<00:05:01.210> out<00:05:01.719> a<00:05:02.080> little<00:05:02.680> bit<00:05:02.919> of<00:05:02.949> the

00:05:03.270 --> 00:05:03.280 
by squeezing out a little bit of the

00:05:03.280 --> 00:05:05.189 
by squeezing out a little bit of the
icing<00:05:03.699> then<00:05:03.909> stop<00:05:04.300> squeezing<00:05:04.960> and<00:05:05.169> lifting

00:05:05.189 --> 00:05:05.199 
icing then stop squeezing and lifting

00:05:05.199 --> 00:05:07.890 
icing then stop squeezing and lifting
and<00:05:06.099> you<00:05:06.129> get<00:05:06.909> that<00:05:07.030> beautiful<00:05:07.270> star

00:05:07.890 --> 00:05:07.900 
and you get that beautiful star

00:05:07.900 --> 00:05:10.050 
and you get that beautiful star
decoration<00:05:08.620> if<00:05:08.830> you<00:05:09.250> don't<00:05:09.430> stop<00:05:09.669> squeezing

00:05:10.050 --> 00:05:10.060 
decoration if you don't stop squeezing

00:05:10.060 --> 00:05:12.240 
decoration if you don't stop squeezing
when<00:05:10.419> you<00:05:10.509> lift<00:05:10.719> away<00:05:10.990> you<00:05:11.050> get<00:05:11.409> a<00:05:11.469> long<00:05:11.860> peak

00:05:12.240 --> 00:05:12.250 
when you lift away you get a long peak

00:05:12.250 --> 00:05:15.059 
when you lift away you get a long peak
that's<00:05:12.580> how<00:05:12.729> that<00:05:12.789> happens<00:05:13.440> when<00:05:14.440> you<00:05:14.560> wet

00:05:15.059 --> 00:05:15.069 
that's how that happens when you wet

00:05:15.069 --> 00:05:16.559 
that's how that happens when you wet
your<00:05:15.219> hand<00:05:15.490> be<00:05:15.669> sure<00:05:15.819> and<00:05:15.969> dry<00:05:16.210> it<00:05:16.270> because<00:05:16.509> it

00:05:16.559 --> 00:05:16.569 
your hand be sure and dry it because it

00:05:16.569 --> 00:05:18.260 
your hand be sure and dry it because it
was<00:05:16.659> getting<00:05:16.960> a<00:05:17.020> little<00:05:17.080> slippery<00:05:17.529> on<00:05:17.650> the<00:05:17.740> bag

00:05:18.260 --> 00:05:18.270 
was getting a little slippery on the bag

00:05:18.270 --> 00:05:21.059 
was getting a little slippery on the bag
you<00:05:19.270> can<00:05:19.300> do<00:05:19.599> rosettes<00:05:20.110> which<00:05:20.469> is<00:05:20.650> the<00:05:20.800> same

00:05:21.059 --> 00:05:21.069 
you can do rosettes which is the same

00:05:21.069 --> 00:05:24.510 
you can do rosettes which is the same
basic<00:05:21.610> thing<00:05:21.879> only<00:05:22.360> I'm<00:05:23.349> going<00:05:23.560> around<00:05:24.009> in<00:05:24.460> a

00:05:24.510 --> 00:05:24.520 
basic thing only I'm going around in a

00:05:24.520 --> 00:05:28.320 
basic thing only I'm going around in a
little<00:05:24.699> circle<00:05:26.099> stop<00:05:27.099> squeezing<00:05:27.490> and<00:05:27.969> lift

00:05:28.320 --> 00:05:28.330 
little circle stop squeezing and lift

00:05:28.330 --> 00:05:29.969 
little circle stop squeezing and lift
off<00:05:28.569> and<00:05:28.840> you<00:05:28.930> can<00:05:29.050> just<00:05:29.080> do<00:05:29.440> a<00:05:29.469> few<00:05:29.740> of<00:05:29.860> those

00:05:29.969 --> 00:05:29.979 
off and you can just do a few of those

00:05:29.979 --> 00:05:32.760 
off and you can just do a few of those
and<00:05:30.190> stick<00:05:30.699> birthday<00:05:31.090> candles<00:05:31.539> right<00:05:31.719> in<00:05:31.930> but

00:05:38.580 --> 00:05:38.590 
the shell border that can be done just

00:05:38.590 --> 00:05:40.860 
the shell border that can be done just
straight<00:05:39.099> like<00:05:39.279> a<00:05:39.310> little<00:05:39.550> snail<00:05:39.879> or<00:05:40.210> sideways

straight like a little snail or sideways

00:05:40.870 --> 00:05:43.379 
straight like a little snail or sideways
like<00:05:41.080> a<00:05:41.139> semi<00:05:41.500> rosette<00:05:42.009> but<00:05:42.789> the<00:05:42.909> easiest<00:05:43.180> way

00:05:43.379 --> 00:05:43.389 
like a semi rosette but the easiest way

00:05:43.389 --> 00:05:45.089 
like a semi rosette but the easiest way
is<00:05:43.539> to<00:05:43.690> do<00:05:43.960> the<00:05:44.080> straight<00:05:44.440> where<00:05:44.680> you<00:05:44.770> start

00:05:45.089 --> 00:05:45.099 
is to do the straight where you start

00:05:45.099 --> 00:05:47.430 
is to do the straight where you start
piping<00:05:45.339> and<00:05:45.849> then<00:05:46.000> back<00:05:46.389> away<00:05:46.719> gradually

00:05:47.430 --> 00:05:47.440 
piping and then back away gradually

00:05:47.440 --> 00:05:51.540 
piping and then back away gradually
releasing<00:05:48.430> and<00:05:48.669> then<00:05:49.360> lift<00:05:49.629> away<00:05:50.159> then<00:05:51.159> start

00:05:51.540 --> 00:05:51.550 
releasing and then lift away then start

00:05:51.550 --> 00:05:53.249

00:07:10.720 --> 00:07:10.730 
the most perfect decorations and as you

00:07:10.730 --> 00:07:12.520 
the most perfect decorations and as you
start<00:07:11.030> using<00:07:11.240> up<00:07:11.510> the<00:07:11.660> buttercream<00:07:12.050> just<00:07:12.140> keep

00:07:12.520 --> 00:07:12.530 
start using up the buttercream just keep

00:07:12.530 --> 00:07:14.410

twisting<00:07:13.070> I've<00:07:13.220> never<00:07:13.400> unlocked<00:07:13.820> my<00:07:14.000> fingers

00:07:14.410 --> 00:07:14.420 
twisting I've never unlocked my fingers

00:07:14.420 --> 00:07:16.870 
twisting I've never unlocked my fingers
because<00:07:14.840> the<00:07:15.110> nono<00:07:15.470> of<00:07:15.770> piping<00:07:16.280> is<00:07:16.460> to<00:07:16.640> have<00:07:16.760> it

00:07:16.870 --> 00:07:16.880 
because the nono of piping is to have it

00:07:16.880 --> 00:07:18.670 
because the nono of piping is to have it
come<00:07:17.030> up<00:07:17.150> the<00:07:17.300> top<00:07:17.510> that's<00:07:17.960> why<00:07:18.200> when<00:07:18.410> you<00:07:18.500> use

00:07:18.670 --> 00:07:18.680 
come up the top that's why when you use

00:07:18.680 --> 00:07:21.130 
come up the top that's why when you use
a<00:07:18.710> zip<00:07:19.100> seal<00:07:19.340> bag<00:07:19.640> it's<00:07:20.240> closed<00:07:20.660> so<00:07:20.840> when<00:07:21.050> you

00:07:21.130 --> 00:07:21.140 
a zip seal bag it's closed so when you

00:07:21.140 --> 00:07:23.170 
a zip seal bag it's closed so when you
let<00:07:21.290> kids<00:07:21.530> do<00:07:21.800> that<00:07:21.980> you<00:07:22.670> don't<00:07:22.730> have<00:07:22.820> to<00:07:22.970> worry

00:07:23.170 --> 00:07:23.180 
let kids do that you don't have to worry

00:07:23.180 --> 00:07:24.640 
let kids do that you don't have to worry
about<00:07:23.270> it<00:07:23.510> coming<00:07:23.780> out<00:07:23.840> anywhere<00:07:24.290> but<00:07:24.530> the

about it coming out anywhere but the
front<00:07:24.950> it<00:07:25.130> will<00:07:25.280> still<00:07:25.520> get<00:07:25.730> all<00:07:25.880> over

00:07:26.080 --> 00:07:26.090
