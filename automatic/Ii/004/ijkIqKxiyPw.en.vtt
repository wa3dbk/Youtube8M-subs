00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.149
 hello my name is pablo villaça the critic 

00:00:01.860 --> 00:00:05.730
 of cinema director of the cinema portal in 

00:00:03.149 --> 00:00:06.899
 scene and I saw the spectacular spider man 

00:00:05.730 --> 00:00:09.210
 2 

00:00:06.899 --> 00:00:10.679
 the threat of electronics that I 

00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:13.559
 obtained in the subtitle only exists in 

00:00:10.679 --> 00:00:15.740
 Portuguese created and this title is 

00:00:13.559 --> 00:00:19.260
 immense 

00:00:15.740 --> 00:00:22.680
 I did not like the movie, it's past. 

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:24.779
 several reasons first that it is a mere 

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:27.869
 repetition of a technology that 

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:31.189
 ended only a few years doing 

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:34.140
 He calls reboots are so soon 

00:00:31.189 --> 00:00:36.480
 little bit so soon after the 

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:38.309
 closure of the original trilogy is 

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:40.590
 mainly something was caused by the 

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:41.730
 failure in the third finally 

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:44.250
 terms of box office but we have to 

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:48.350
 reception of the public and criticism is a 

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:51.680
 film that deeply flawed man and 

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:55.350
 then a little dispensable 

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:58.440
 especially considering that one more 

00:00:55.350 --> 00:01:01.739
 time the story of the character 's origin 

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:08.040
 that hurt a lot 

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:10.580
 This was not only the irregular direction I 

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:18.360
 I wrote about the movie I said in detail 

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:19.470
 that it was converted is 13 to say the 

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:21.240
 same 

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:22.530
 not that the 3d of the new movie is 

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:26.580
 particularly good that it is not too 

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:31.710
 indispensable but problematic 

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:35.490
 the development of Garfield's tone 

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:37.950
 narrative in every way the movie 

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:39.990
 past was the movie deeply 

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:41.310
 disappointed which is a shame because it's 

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:43.740
 a character I particularly like 

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:46.220
 A lot is a super hero that has to deal 

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:48.260
 with problems that are problems 

00:01:46.220 --> 00:01:50.510
 a year of many people not only because it is a 

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:54.200
 young person with financial difficulties has 

00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:56.660
 to get money to support 

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:59.870
 right way but whatever course has 

00:01:56.660 --> 00:02:02.540
 old cliché playoff 80 but he's a hero 

00:01:59.870 --> 00:02:05.600
 with which it is easier to identify 

00:02:02.540 --> 00:02:08.810
 with multi-billionaire how they have or how 

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:10.670
 an alien like clapper is then 

00:02:08.810 --> 00:02:14.480
 it was really a shame 

00:02:10.670 --> 00:02:15.920
 both the popular 34 and 16 man the 

00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:18.170
 Spectacular spider man and if the 

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:20.930
 Spectacular Spiderman 2 

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:24.590
 In contrast, it is a movie where 

00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:26.690
 Aide erred and if it succeeds, it's aaa 

00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:28.850
 main difficulty of the previous one 

00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:31.640
 find a tone that narrative 

00:02:28.850 --> 00:02:34.190
 This new movie draws a letter from one thing 

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:36.830
 amazing how the movie succeeds 

00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:38.270
 same time find a man with humor 

00:02:36.830 --> 00:02:41.420
 spider and it's something that I missed 

00:02:38.270 --> 00:02:43.040
 in the Spider-Man do not take guay or even 

00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:45.260
 the best five same number two that 

00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:47.030
 still the favorite is really 

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:50.090
 that movie was a bit lacking in 

00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:51.709
 dear that irreverent humor of the 

00:02:50.090 --> 00:02:54.260
 Spiderman in this movie is 

00:02:51.709 --> 00:02:56.450
 present from the beginning is the people 

00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:57.920
 people realize that it is a first that has 

00:02:56.450 --> 00:03:00.920
 pleasure in what he's doing has 

00:02:57.920 --> 00:03:03.980
 nice to be a spider man and he has 

00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:06.140
 one faces the world in a way 

00:03:03.980 --> 00:03:09.410
 fun despite the problems that 

00:03:06.140 --> 00:03:10.610
 facing this, but at the same time 

00:03:09.410 --> 00:03:12.380
 time the film can be quite 

00:03:10.610 --> 00:03:15.200
 time consuming and there are fun times 

00:03:12.380 --> 00:03:17.330
 movie the movie manages to find 

00:03:15.200 --> 00:03:19.549
 dramatic elements of using these 

00:03:17.330 --> 00:03:22.010
 dramatic elements in a very 

00:03:19.549 --> 00:03:24.200
 efficient is the third act without choice 

00:03:22.010 --> 00:03:27.260
 clear but it must have its act in which the 

00:03:24.200 --> 00:03:29.299
 plot not only personal peter dramas 

00:03:27.260 --> 00:03:32.780
 park but the drama of the villains too 

00:03:29.299 --> 00:03:35.870
 do in a moment they stood up 

00:03:32.780 --> 00:03:38.870
 benefiting from the lightness that came before 

00:03:35.870 --> 00:03:40.310
 this is this counterpoint works great 

00:03:38.870 --> 00:03:40.700
 well then the time to show is very 

00:03:40.310 --> 00:03:43.130
 good 

00:03:40.700 --> 00:03:44.570
 the pt pa that works much better play 

00:03:43.130 --> 00:03:46.700
 football obviously much more at ease 

00:03:44.570 --> 00:03:49.580
 and can also oscillate between moments 

00:03:46.700 --> 00:03:52.250
 of humor and drama is a story the actress 

00:03:49.580 --> 00:03:54.110
 always very lovely then create a url 

00:03:52.250 --> 00:03:55.760
 stacey that people understand why the 

00:03:54.110 --> 00:03:57.950
 peter parker at the same time as 

00:03:55.760 --> 00:03:58.769
 preserve there he can not stay 

00:03:57.950 --> 00:04:01.930
 away from her 

00:03:58.769 --> 00:04:03.489
 the villains are interesting villains 

00:04:01.930 --> 00:04:06.459
 I think the fox team got one thing 

00:04:03.489 --> 00:04:07.540
 which is a feat that is in some 

00:04:06.459 --> 00:04:09.280
 moments the first act of the movie 

00:04:07.540 --> 00:04:10.870
 including the use of the trail that is the 

00:04:09.280 --> 00:04:13.930
 first point is very weak of this 

00:04:10.870 --> 00:04:16.780
 movie is exists has a middle character 

00:04:13.930 --> 00:04:20.349
 hot in that reminds even those 

00:04:16.780 --> 00:04:23.139
 batman until it was hit by r 60 and the 

00:04:20.349 --> 00:04:25.120
 batman the last two batman and jorge 

00:04:23.139 --> 00:04:28.410
 macchi which is an attempt to make a 

00:04:25.120 --> 00:04:30.759
 humor that is a very hot man with a 

00:04:28.410 --> 00:04:33.550
 character whose grace is absolutely 

00:04:30.759 --> 00:04:36.340
 caricature but he makes a transition 

00:04:33.550 --> 00:04:37.810
 caricatures and using 

00:04:36.340 --> 00:04:39.639
 this gap with the starting point 

00:04:37.810 --> 00:04:40.990
 for villainy and this film transition 

00:04:39.639 --> 00:04:46.780
 with two very well of the day in forks 

00:04:40.990 --> 00:04:48.789
 leads very well and becomes the villain who 

00:04:46.780 --> 00:04:51.669
 It was never one of my favorite movies. 

00:04:48.789 --> 00:04:53.710
 not that he has become but he has 

00:04:51.669 --> 00:04:59.770
 motivations more complex than in the 

00:04:53.710 --> 00:05:01.150
 technology and new relationship 

00:04:59.770 --> 00:05:04.030
 badly resolved with the country there are 

00:05:01.150 --> 00:05:06.520
 personal issues of new spoiler that 

00:05:04.030 --> 00:05:07.659
 which makes the character more 

00:05:06.520 --> 00:05:09.460
 multifaceted 

00:05:07.659 --> 00:05:14.229
 following action'm fine 

00:05:09.460 --> 00:05:15.400
 conducted is the division of the 

00:05:14.229 --> 00:05:17.770
 movie works very well 

00:05:15.400 --> 00:05:19.570
 2 that condemned remains the favorite 

00:05:17.770 --> 00:05:21.880
 but he had structural problems 

00:05:19.570 --> 00:05:24.490
 works for example the sequence of the subway is 

00:05:21.880 --> 00:05:25.960
 with the top is the climax of the film but is 

00:05:24.490 --> 00:05:28.539
 in the middle of the movie is this sign going 

00:05:25.960 --> 00:05:32.220
 creating were growing until the climate 

00:05:28.539 --> 00:05:32.220
 that really works like a climax 

00:05:32.610 --> 00:05:37.630
 So I said it's not perfect, there are some. 

00:05:36.159 --> 00:05:41.050
 problems to target unbearable 

00:05:37.630 --> 00:05:43.150
 she makes a point of commenting on the whole movie 

00:05:41.050 --> 00:05:46.570
 It's one of the most dramatic moments of joy. 

00:05:43.150 --> 00:05:48.550
 to the moments of humor and the joy of the 

00:05:46.570 --> 00:05:50.320
 friends when the defendant meets Peter 

00:05:48.550 --> 00:05:51.909
 everton is a track that really she 

00:05:50.320 --> 00:05:53.940
 chews all the feelings that the 

00:05:51.909 --> 00:05:56.860
 viewer must feel from start to finish 

00:05:53.940 --> 00:05:59.110
 and digital effects mainly 

00:05:56.860 --> 00:06:00.880
 used to create a mere irregular 

00:05:59.110 --> 00:06:02.919
 if later you will and it will be over 

00:06:00.880 --> 00:06:04.539
 getting used to the beginning of the movie 

00:06:02.919 --> 00:06:07.210
 in the sequence involving a strong car 

00:06:04.539 --> 00:06:08.979
 and it almost seems that the animation is as if 

00:06:07.210 --> 00:06:09.910
 actually had the design of the 

00:06:08.979 --> 00:06:13.150
 no man 

00:06:09.910 --> 00:06:14.950
 ivete and this clearly impairs the suspension 

00:06:13.150 --> 00:06:16.870
 disbelief is compromised because the 

00:06:14.950 --> 00:06:19.660
 people dangle from their own live action 

00:06:16.870 --> 00:06:21.850
 person with an animation but it's a movie 

00:06:19.660 --> 00:06:25.840
 As I said, I am immensely pleased. 

00:06:21.850 --> 00:06:27.040
 writing on it is for me it's the second 

00:06:25.840 --> 00:06:28.180
 best of all movies 

00:06:27.040 --> 00:06:30.190
 Spiderman produced until now that 

00:06:28.180 --> 00:06:33.310
 really only back for the third time a 

00:06:30.190 --> 00:06:35.170
 spiderman fan 2 is but was not what 

00:06:33.310 --> 00:06:37.300
 I loved it funny, the movie has a 

00:06:35.170 --> 00:06:39.340
 Very good pace is two and twenty 

00:06:37.300 --> 00:06:41.650
 But you do not feel the pass, so he has. 

00:06:39.340 --> 00:06:44.380
 one stitches the rhythm of the 

00:06:41.650 --> 00:06:46.450
 narrative and how to know how to 

00:06:44.380 --> 00:06:47.860
 between the moments of action really go 

00:06:46.450 --> 00:06:49.450
 to the one in which Peter Park is more 

00:06:47.860 --> 00:06:52.630
 calm with him 

00:06:49.450 --> 00:06:54.720
 I really liked a big hug of good ones. 

00:06:52.630 --> 00:06:54.720
 movies
