00:00:05.689 --> 00:00:09.150
 selection of ajax gathered 

00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:09.990
 Monday tomorrow for the future for one 

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:12.150
 walkout training 

00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:14.070
 the morning after the defeat against vitesse 

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:15.420
 was all about recovery and it 

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:16.830
 licking the wounds 

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:19.020
 the blow that the Amsterdammer in Sunday 

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:21.720
 arnhem still fully coped with thumps 

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:24.200
 how is the mood 

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:24.200
 yes gloomy 

00:00:24.260 --> 00:00:30.980
 we have the universe together 

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:33.600
 spoken and yes made a good appointment 

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:35.790
 and see what 

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:37.530
 what we have to do light is a tip 

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:39.270
 from the veil on how does something like that go 

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:40.559
 discuss people 

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:43.739
 we just come with all together 

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:47.670
 and then one takes the lead 

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:49.890
 to take the floor and yes he says that 

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:51.840
 what he saw yeast from the bank and 

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:53.370
 what he thinks about it 

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:56.129
 and then yes then he asks the most 

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:58.409
 supplier another most important 

00:00:56.129 --> 00:01:00.839
 players in our team what they think of it 

00:00:58.409 --> 00:01:02.190
 find what the better should be and yes so go 

00:01:00.839 --> 00:01:04.379
 further 

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:05.790
 the will be harder 

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:09.210
 no that of course should not be one 

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:11.960
 solution and of course yes that one 

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:14.729
 is just very angry and it comes with 

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:17.670
 words that we believe are just 

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:20.909
 that just belongs and learned from it 

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:24.350
 we only and yes he just has 

00:01:20.909 --> 00:01:27.689
 things said that we just have 

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:28.890
 heard and then discussed 

00:01:27.689 --> 00:01:30.479
 those are the results of that 

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:33.420
 talk about the dots you have 

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:36.149
 indicated dots that should be better 

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:37.890
 we have to go back to the basics that there 

00:01:36.149 --> 00:01:39.090
 just 

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:41.640
 something together should something 

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:43.020
 invent what works and how we do it 

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:46.350
 will come out here as soon as possible and 

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:47.280
 to be able to look up again and 

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:49.140
 points that they take 

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:51.270
 most important thing and that starts again 

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:52.770
 at the base 

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:54.509
 and how do you do what that is, say 

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:55.560
 but the basis where do you go to 

00:01:54.509 --> 00:01:59.039
 back 

00:01:55.560 --> 00:02:01.619
 yes we are ajax and we are always one 

00:01:59.039 --> 00:02:04.470
 solve all pledged football team hours 

00:02:01.619 --> 00:02:07.170
 and from there we always want yes 

00:02:04.470 --> 00:02:10.049
 combination playing football and forward 

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:12.930
 play 60 7 percent have possession of the 

00:02:10.049 --> 00:02:15.420
 hell of the opponent and chances 

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:17.370
 they created most important but difficult 

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:19.390
 it now for a while not then 

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:22.060
 yes teams 

00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:23.890
 know how we play 

00:02:22.060 --> 00:02:25.959
 Peter gave a good answer to that and 

00:02:23.890 --> 00:02:27.219
 then put good pressure and then we know 

00:02:25.959 --> 00:02:28.659
 it is no more than we sweden the 

00:02:27.219 --> 00:02:30.659
 long ball or we just do not come out 

00:02:28.659 --> 00:02:32.859
 and we have to come up with something 

00:02:30.659 --> 00:02:36.340
 backlog is now 9 points 

00:02:32.859 --> 00:02:37.780
 psv is now all lost or not yet 

00:02:36.340 --> 00:02:40.840
 I think that's about it now 

00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:42.340
 I think we just talk to ourselves 

00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:43.450
 and we just have to look hard 

00:02:42.340 --> 00:02:44.680
 have to work that that is the one too 

00:02:43.450 --> 00:02:47.260
 indicated 

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:50.109
 hard work and then what we are good at 

00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:51.280
 so hold position play and possession and 

00:02:50.109 --> 00:02:52.629
 maybe we can go from there again 

00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:55.060
 look up but I think we are now 

00:02:52.629 --> 00:02:55.780
 just our game should play better 

00:02:55.060 --> 00:02:57.879
 have to play 

00:02:55.780 --> 00:02:59.349
 we just have a lot of quality it 

00:02:57.879 --> 00:03:01.030
 is n't coming out yet 

00:02:59.349 --> 00:03:03.750
 but i have the fox trust it 

00:03:01.030 --> 00:03:03.750
 good will come
