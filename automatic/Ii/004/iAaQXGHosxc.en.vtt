00:00:00.610 --> 00:00:06.340
 today we are going to show how to put together 

00:00:03.130 --> 00:00:10.809
 a wooden base must receive its base 

00:00:06.340 --> 00:00:14.230
 of wood with 3 2-meter-long 

00:00:10.809 --> 00:00:17.940
 which 1 in the center is marked 

00:00:14.230 --> 00:00:22.310
 on one side with the number 1 

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:22.310
 and on the other side 

00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:25.360
 with the number 2 

00:00:27.620 --> 00:00:32.050
 you will also receive 2 hardware 

00:00:32.470 --> 00:00:38.530
 of metal that is marked with the number 

00:00:35.650 --> 00:00:41.160
 one and one side of the left side and 

00:00:38.530 --> 00:00:41.160
 the right 

00:00:44.350 --> 00:00:49.239
 the other ironwork that is marked with the 

00:00:47.140 --> 00:00:52.120
 number 2 on the bottom e 

00:00:49.239 --> 00:00:54.329
 equally beats and the one on the right 

00:00:52.120 --> 00:00:54.329
 left 

00:00:56.900 --> 00:01:00.580
 will come with four legs 

00:01:00.820 --> 00:01:06.700
 of 70 centimeters each that come 

00:01:04.300 --> 00:01:09.820
 marked with the number 1 that means 

00:01:06.700 --> 00:01:13.680
 that goes in the hardware 1 and with the 

00:01:09.820 --> 00:01:13.680
 abbreviation of left and right 

00:01:17.890 --> 00:01:22.420
 the same with the other two legs that 

00:01:20.440 --> 00:01:26.909
 comes marked with the number two with the 

00:01:22.420 --> 00:01:26.909
 same abbreviation right left 

00:01:30.940 --> 00:01:38.620
 six screws come 

00:01:34.270 --> 00:01:40.430
 with two rounds and two nuts 

00:01:38.620 --> 00:01:44.290
 of 9 

00:01:40.430 --> 00:01:47.030
 of 9 mm 

00:01:44.290 --> 00:01:49.340
 and finally 

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:53.179
 two layers 

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:55.130
 caps that will be put on the skids in 

00:01:53.179 --> 00:01:57.200
 the top part that will serve as 

00:01:55.130 --> 00:02:00.219
 hook 1 

00:01:57.200 --> 00:02:00.219
 and number 2 

00:02:01.260 --> 00:02:05.120
 good let's go to put it together 

00:02:10.390 --> 00:02:17.870
 first you take the number one ironwork 

00:02:14.510 --> 00:02:23.049
 and on the side that says have 

00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:23.049
 it is inserted in one of the fittings 

00:02:31.319 --> 00:02:36.540
 the screw is put leaving one of 

00:02:34.049 --> 00:02:39.560
 the rounds at the top 

00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:39.560
 the other in the part 

00:02:59.790 --> 00:03:07.250
 the same with the left leg is done 

00:03:03.599 --> 00:03:07.250
 the same about all the skids 

00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:17.810
 probably enough with your hand 

00:03:14.950 --> 00:03:20.800
 but he's always good scared with a 

00:03:17.810 --> 00:03:20.800
 Spanish Key 

00:03:24.140 --> 00:03:26.980
 and a lot 

00:03:42.510 --> 00:03:47.579
 after this step the bar is put 

00:03:45.330 --> 00:03:50.269
 from the center that is marked with the 

00:03:47.579 --> 00:03:50.269
 number 1 

00:03:50.319 --> 00:03:55.590
 is introduced into the hardware of the same 

00:03:53.170 --> 00:03:55.590
 number 

00:03:57.250 --> 00:04:03.430
 it may be that for some reason the 

00:04:00.880 --> 00:04:06.490
 holes are not a matter of 

00:04:03.430 --> 00:04:08.860
 find the exact point is to move it from 

00:04:06.490 --> 00:04:11.200
 certain way in a certain way to 

00:04:08.860 --> 00:04:14.370
 find 

00:04:11.200 --> 00:04:14.370
 a center of wood 

00:04:15.220 --> 00:04:18.780
 and follow the same process 

00:04:34.630 --> 00:04:40.570
 It is normal that when you receive grape 

00:04:36.760 --> 00:04:42.910
 look a little bit scraped the part that 

00:04:40.570 --> 00:04:46.420
 enter this is normal this part is not 

00:04:42.910 --> 00:04:49.600
 You will see in the visible part of the base 

00:04:46.420 --> 00:04:51.870
 simply bending the metal with the 

00:04:49.600 --> 00:04:51.870
 wood 

00:04:52.440 --> 00:04:57.060
 here the side 2 mate already armed 

00:04:55.380 --> 00:04:58.470
 it must be exactly the same 

00:04:57.060 --> 00:05:04.130
 way 

00:04:58.470 --> 00:05:04.130
 and the last step is to put the 2 polynes 

00:05:11.370 --> 00:05:18.090
 without insurance they simply enter with the 

00:05:14.699 --> 00:05:20.750
 same gravity just drop 

00:05:18.090 --> 00:05:20.750
 and ready 

00:05:21.270 --> 00:05:25.380
 they do not have any position and they are 

00:05:23.370 --> 00:05:27.720
 different 

00:05:25.380 --> 00:05:30.270
 as it means that the one that we put here 

00:05:27.720 --> 00:05:33.000
 could go the other way and they can go 

00:05:30.270 --> 00:05:34.980
 finally up or down 

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:37.320
 the helmets 

00:05:34.980 --> 00:05:40.400
 It is used as a hook without any insurance 

00:05:37.320 --> 00:05:40.400
 just settle 

00:05:48.950 --> 00:05:54.220
 well the base is ready we settle 

00:05:51.380 --> 00:05:54.220
 now a brand 

00:05:57.689 --> 00:06:01.879
 This is a luxury American cot 

00:06:02.090 --> 00:06:09.010
 of sale in www to marks merida point 

00:06:06.260 --> 00:06:09.010
 com.mx 

00:06:29.340 --> 00:06:34.050
 the base is adjusted to the height what 

00:06:32.550 --> 00:06:36.350
 normal is to hang a little more 

00:06:34.050 --> 00:06:36.350
 high 

00:06:39.320 --> 00:06:44.110
 and well the maca is ready to 

00:06:41.660 --> 00:06:44.110
 prove 

00:06:45.740 --> 00:06:50.139
 first, it is advisable that 

00:06:47.569 --> 00:06:54.139
 he put it to be that he tries himself sitting down 

00:06:50.139 --> 00:06:56.320
 carefully and then it goes according to the 

00:06:54.139 --> 00:06:59.580
 what is the hammock 

00:06:56.320 --> 00:07:03.420
 it is accommodating in this case it was fine 

00:06:59.580 --> 00:07:03.420
 maybe a little bit taller 

00:07:11.680 --> 00:07:18.419
 It is always advisable to put a 

00:07:13.720 --> 00:07:18.419
 little bit higher for it to yield 

00:07:18.440 --> 00:07:26.340
 and ready the hammock is ready to be used 

00:07:22.449 --> 00:07:26.340
 and resist up to two people
