00:00:09.580 --> 00:00:14.200

00:00:12.130 --> 00:00:16.120

00:00:14.200 --> 00:00:17.290
 I am very sorry for that 

00:00:16.120 --> 00:00:19.180

00:00:17.290 --> 00:00:20.590

00:00:19.180 --> 00:00:23.350
 unfortunately there was no time for that 

00:00:20.590 --> 00:00:25.450

00:00:30.130 --> 00:00:32.800

00:00:31.210 --> 00:00:34.390
 So now I am a show of my own 

00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:35.560

00:00:34.390 --> 00:00:37.360
 Of course, I still invite mine 

00:00:35.560 --> 00:00:38.770
 movie projects are high and it certainly will 

00:00:37.360 --> 00:00:40.480
 sometimes something else , even if you 

00:00:38.770 --> 00:00:41.770

00:00:41.770 --> 00:00:45.160
 It is very important for us to follow this 

00:00:43.360 --> 00:00:46.810

00:00:52.780 --> 00:00:55.840

00:00:55.840 --> 00:00:58.660

00:00:57.280 --> 00:01:00.399
 I do not speak every Tuesday 

00:00:58.660 --> 00:01:02.290
 a new game here is also about 

00:01:00.399 --> 00:01:03.520
 you are also about apps 

00:01:02.290 --> 00:01:05.379
 Of course I'm talking about the 

00:01:03.520 --> 00:01:07.270
 latest technology trends and above all and 

00:01:05.379 --> 00:01:08.830
 the new console generation where we 

00:01:07.270 --> 00:01:10.090
 since the theme would be a few ago 

00:01:08.830 --> 00:01:10.870
 weeks was the playstation 4 

00:01:10.090 --> 00:01:12.970
 presented 

00:01:10.870 --> 00:01:15.340
 I'm yakuza playstation fans has 

00:01:12.970 --> 00:01:17.260
 at that time started with the playstation 1 

00:01:15.340 --> 00:01:18.729
 At that time I used to live with Kugel 

00:01:17.260 --> 00:01:20.890
 evil gambled and my first own 

00:01:18.729 --> 00:01:22.990
 console was then the playstation 2 one 

00:01:20.890 --> 00:01:24.240
 The mac's fantasy was intense 

00:01:22.990 --> 00:01:26.920
 control 

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:28.299
 that is infected you may even 

00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:29.950
 I will not talk about it 

00:01:28.299 --> 00:01:31.240
 anyway because on the channel I may 

00:01:29.950 --> 00:01:33.700
 Everything and I think it does not take long 

00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:35.590
 lasted 2005 the psp came out and the 

00:01:33.700 --> 00:01:37.299
 playstation modemobil the next big one 

00:01:35.590 --> 00:01:39.040
 thing was of course the playstation 3 

00:01:37.299 --> 00:01:40.869
 Not only did I playstation myself though 

00:01:39.040 --> 00:01:42.850
 had me synonymous left party 60 bought 

00:01:40.869 --> 00:01:45.729
 and you but him as the playstation 3 

00:01:42.850 --> 00:01:46.450
 House came to sell the xbox and this 

00:01:45.729 --> 00:01:47.920
 also stow away 

00:01:46.450 --> 00:01:49.780
 Of course, all consoles are right 

00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:51.880
 cool but I'm such a small 

00:01:49.780 --> 00:01:52.480
 playstation fanboy but as I said today 

00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:55.630
 applies 

00:01:52.480 --> 00:01:57.720
 the new station 4 sony has little 

00:01:55.630 --> 00:01:59.590
 revealed to the controller 

00:01:57.720 --> 00:02:00.790
 system components and what they are 

00:01:59.590 --> 00:02:02.710
 introduce with the playstation video 

00:02:00.790 --> 00:02:05.020
 but the few trailer the shown 

00:02:02.710 --> 00:02:06.610
 have swept me away the new cool 

00:02:05.020 --> 00:02:09.430
 such a box tops 

00:02:06.610 --> 00:02:11.770
 the down you have a trailer watched 

00:02:09.430 --> 00:02:14.350
 When I finally look at you finally 

00:02:11.770 --> 00:02:16.360
 finally really escola de with 60 frames 

00:02:14.350 --> 00:02:18.070
 the foresight and the graphic details 

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:20.920
 flew over the city were really 

00:02:18.070 --> 00:02:22.420
 blatant or hot hot stocks seen when 

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:22.840
 I do not know any external 

00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:24.280
 more 

00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:26.260
 Imagine the drain and the 

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:28.390
 Graphics and I have to say like matrix 

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:30.670
 world in which everything is networked 

00:02:28.390 --> 00:02:31.480
 happy to chop it into any life can do it 

00:02:30.670 --> 00:02:33.340
 just great 

00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:34.960
 I love those action adventures and 

00:02:33.340 --> 00:02:36.760
 I think that's better if 

00:02:34.960 --> 00:02:38.560
 Assassin's creed or do you have the deep 

00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:40.840
 down trailer from capcom I am 

00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:42.610
 great fan of skyrim and demand service 

00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:44.350
 and this guy was about these details 

00:02:42.610 --> 00:02:46.300
 they have been celebrating there since only men 

00:02:44.350 --> 00:02:48.040
 none as a reward to the knight with fire 

00:02:46.300 --> 00:02:49.900
 Spit has smelled literally 

00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:50.560
 burns again and I believe that 

00:02:49.900 --> 00:02:52.090
 really good 

00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:53.830
 Of course a hater will say it again 

00:02:52.090 --> 00:02:55.990
 roman corti and the playstation not 

00:02:53.830 --> 00:02:57.670
 shown to be clear because the 3d 

00:02:55.990 --> 00:02:59.350
 show that and ultimately is 

00:02:57.670 --> 00:03:01.150
 it shit wii console looks like 

00:02:59.350 --> 00:03:03.040
 main thing the games and cool I mean 

00:03:01.150 --> 00:03:04.930
 Playstation 30 out with a big breed box 

00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:06.760
 I am so happy that we are the first 

00:03:04.930 --> 00:03:08.860
 I can see the next material 

00:03:06.760 --> 00:03:11.140
 my xbox is already out since 2005 and 

00:03:08.860 --> 00:03:12.520
 I have the playstation since 2006 

00:03:11.140 --> 00:03:14.320
 I think and it will be easy now 

00:03:12.520 --> 00:03:15.970
 time that we get new hardware I 

00:03:14.320 --> 00:03:17.560
 believe the next exercise is then what 

00:03:15.970 --> 00:03:19.209
 about the new xbox I'm natural 

00:03:17.560 --> 00:03:21.610
 means to all news from the gaming world 

00:03:19.209 --> 00:03:23.320
 and I think 2013 could be awesome 

00:03:21.610 --> 00:03:24.760
 year will be so people that 's it too 

00:03:23.320 --> 00:03:26.050
 that was the first consequence 

00:03:24.760 --> 00:03:27.820
 next time I have so much on 

00:03:26.050 --> 00:03:29.230
 beginning but completely to point so 

00:03:27.820 --> 00:03:31.000

00:03:29.230 --> 00:03:32.860
