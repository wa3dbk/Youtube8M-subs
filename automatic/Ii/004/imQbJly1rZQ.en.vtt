00:03:34.959 --> 00:03:38.180 
going to start straightening the back
there's<00:03:35.650> my<00:03:35.830> heat<00:03:36.040> protectant<00:03:36.550> spray<00:03:36.610> again

00:03:38.190 --> 00:03:40.800 
there's my heat protectant spray again
so<00:03:39.190> the<00:03:39.730> reason<00:03:40.090> I'm<00:03:40.209> specifically

00:03:40.800 --> 00:03:40.810 
so the reason I'm specifically

00:03:40.810 --> 00:03:42.660 
so the reason I'm specifically
suctioning<00:03:41.470> this<00:03:41.620> part<00:03:41.860> of<00:03:41.950> my<00:03:42.069> hair<00:03:42.280> off<00:03:42.430> and

00:03:42.660 --> 00:03:42.670 
suctioning this part of my hair off and

00:03:42.670 --> 00:03:44.550 
suctioning this part of my hair off and
using<00:03:42.910> the<00:03:43.120> brush<00:03:43.269> and<00:03:43.660> all<00:03:43.750> that<00:03:43.930> jazz<00:03:44.170> is

00:03:44.550 --> 00:03:44.560 
using the brush and all that jazz is

00:03:44.560 --> 00:03:46.229 
using the brush and all that jazz is
because<00:03:45.040> I<00:03:45.069> want<00:03:45.400> some<00:03:45.580> roots<00:03:45.819> in<00:03:45.970> the<00:03:46.060> back

00:03:46.229 --> 00:03:46.239 
because I want some roots in the back

00:03:46.239 --> 00:03:48.690 
because I want some roots in the back
for<00:03:46.480> the<00:03:46.569> extra<00:03:46.900> straight<00:03:47.200> also<00:03:48.100> because<00:03:48.549> it's

00:03:48.690 --> 00:03:48.700 
for the extra straight also because it's

00:03:48.700 --> 00:03:50.729 
for the extra straight also because it's
part<00:03:48.940> of<00:03:49.030> my<00:03:49.150> hair<00:03:49.330> does<00:03:49.510> not<00:03:49.660> stay<00:03:50.019> straight

00:03:50.729 --> 00:03:50.739 
part of my hair does not stay straight

00:03:50.739 --> 00:03:52.470 
part of my hair does not stay straight
as<00:03:50.920> long<00:03:51.250> as<00:03:51.430> the<00:03:51.519> other<00:03:51.670> pieces<00:03:51.940> of<00:03:52.180> my<00:03:52.299> hair
