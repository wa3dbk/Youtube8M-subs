00:00:02.430 --> 00:00:07.650
 and our program nowadays already for the cassia region of the coconut trees we are going 

00:00:07.649 --> 00:00:08.989
 to know 

00:00:08.989 --> 00:00:13.330
 enchanted valley of light-producing property 

00:00:13.330 --> 00:00:15.919
 day to dentist surgeon 

00:00:15.919 --> 00:00:17.460
 I have a passion 

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:20.809
 the world of bees and of course the preservation of the environment 

00:00:32.270 --> 00:00:36.510
 the doctor Ana is looking for a suitable place for an apiary 

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:38.239
 reached nine months 

00:00:38.239 --> 00:00:39.590
 but it was worth it 

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:41.050
 It was really worth it. 

00:00:41.050 --> 00:00:44.460
 the place has privileged by nature 

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:47.460
 to direct the eyes 

00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:51.080
 clear 

00:01:03.520 --> 00:01:06.460
 this region of hills in native forest 

00:01:06.460 --> 00:01:10.260
 presents special characteristics that flora and brother 

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:13.610
 until now allied to the Africanized battery presence 

00:01:13.610 --> 00:01:16.890
 and confers a fabulous potential for Abner's debt 

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:21.130
 beekeeping 

00:01:21.130 --> 00:01:26.600
 is one of the activities capable of causing positive social and 

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:27.770
 economic 

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:29.330
 besides contributing 

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:32.780
 for the maintenance and preservation of existing ecosystems 

00:01:48.230 --> 00:01:52.610
 is a nutrient as it has a high concentration of 

00:01:52.610 --> 00:01:55.249
 carbohydrates lipids proteins 

00:01:55.249 --> 00:01:58.079
 there is less data besides minerals 

00:01:58.079 --> 00:02:02.050
 vitamins for delicate heifer complex 

00:02:02.050 --> 00:02:03.240
 for Ana 

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:06.280
 we have a lot to learn from the key 

00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:10.460
 we began our conversation by asking about the interest of a 

00:02:10.459 --> 00:02:12.940
 dental professional 

00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:15.569
 so the universe of bees 

00:02:15.569 --> 00:02:17.629
 You know that we live in cities. 

00:02:17.629 --> 00:02:20.980
 enclosed dances the houses fleeing violence 

00:02:22.089 --> 00:02:25.510
 It is with that noise of the year with traffic 

00:02:25.510 --> 00:02:29.530
 imagine me in my area of ​​27 years adopted day 

00:02:29.530 --> 00:02:30.840
 enclosed in which 

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:35.069
 four walls dealing with mouth disease illness 

00:02:35.969 --> 00:02:40.539
 then you discover with life that life is not desolate to work 

00:02:40.539 --> 00:02:45.329
 that we have to do something not only for ourselves but also 

00:02:45.329 --> 00:02:46.919
 responsibility 

00:02:46.919 --> 00:02:48.449
 and we all have 

00:02:48.449 --> 00:02:50.889
 with regard to environmental preservation 

00:02:50.889 --> 00:02:55.649
 so I discovered and since very early I liked nature there I stayed 

00:02:55.649 --> 00:02:58.439
 nine months brings something that has 

00:02:58.439 --> 00:03:01.439
 the topography I wanted is a rugged topography 

00:03:02.269 --> 00:03:04.729
 the area with many springs 

00:03:04.729 --> 00:03:09.069
 and the very preserved area for discs outside 

00:03:09.069 --> 00:03:13.339
 so who needs not give up that 90% of them are the native forest 

00:03:14.299 --> 00:03:18.400
 and then it gave me the idea that I could contribute even more 

00:03:19.059 --> 00:03:25.749
 creating here wild animals bee the actress she is not only the ps but she already 

00:03:25.749 --> 00:03:30.259
 is being classified currently has been revised that classification given as 

00:03:30.259 --> 00:03:34.309
 animal and family feel genes that are native to Brazil 

00:03:34.929 --> 00:03:39.350
 like any time you do you have here tubular artist 

00:03:39.350 --> 00:03:44.160
 I have there because it is she is called the correction of the correct name is 

00:03:44.160 --> 00:03:46.080
 africanized thing 

00:03:46.080 --> 00:03:47.189
 what is a television 

00:03:47.189 --> 00:03:51.329
 The fact is that we have a different way of producing large amounts of 

00:03:51.329 --> 00:03:53.360
 of honey but she also 

00:03:53.360 --> 00:03:58.829
 so many large amounts of doing this get loose in the shoot does not 

00:03:58.829 --> 00:04:02.509
 morita that we have several indigenous native chains 

00:04:03.200 --> 00:04:05.609
 some that I do not even know the name is still small 

00:04:05.609 --> 00:04:10.039
 not only of the area not only biologist I did not learn but some that I obtained 

00:04:10.039 --> 00:04:13.039
 bring the tubing into a piece of tree 

00:04:14.379 --> 00:04:20.120
 to be burned in the ipes portal in the river, she is there to ihara jataí who 

00:04:20.120 --> 00:04:24.199
 I got her to keep the collection right here on the site and a magnificent one 

00:04:24.199 --> 00:04:29.600
 also questions marmalade but sharia and other species that I do not 

00:04:29.599 --> 00:04:30.669
 I do not know the name 

00:04:30.669 --> 00:04:33.990
 It was these benesse péricles that are 

00:04:33.990 --> 00:04:35.660
 toilets as 

00:04:35.660 --> 00:04:40.260
 bee pollinating passion fruit and other species that I do not know but I 

00:04:40.260 --> 00:04:41.740
 I know you are lonely 

00:04:41.740 --> 00:04:47.729
 moreover, as a grated nature lover there are other peculiarities of 

00:04:47.729 --> 00:04:49.219
 example she 

00:04:49.219 --> 00:04:52.680
 avail yourself needy 

00:04:52.680 --> 00:04:53.460
 it was a game 

00:04:53.460 --> 00:04:55.849
 ratton shooting for one reason or another 

00:04:55.849 --> 00:04:58.529
 houben broke the bank 

00:04:58.529 --> 00:05:01.629
 produces some other roads that are very interesting 

00:05:03.300 --> 00:05:07.190
 this is my motivation also the issue of candle produced with mats 

00:05:07.190 --> 00:05:08.460
 from aveiro 

00:05:08.460 --> 00:05:11.949
 so here on the site we have to try to do 

00:05:11.949 --> 00:05:15.960
 and it's for everything we need that we have to try to reproduce here 

00:05:15.960 --> 00:05:16.610
 same 

00:05:16.610 --> 00:05:18.629
 for example the hill sculptures 

00:05:18.629 --> 00:05:23.089
 I would not normally commit these branches here because they are branches of 

00:05:23.089 --> 00:05:28.129
 trees that were burned cut because the tree that rot 

00:05:28.129 --> 00:05:32.639
 naturally it does not produce beautiful sculpture if it cuts then the ones I 

00:05:32.639 --> 00:05:36.139
 usually the same raids on the neighbors 

00:05:36.759 --> 00:05:40.610
 that if one is destroyed trees are deforested areas is another of these 

00:05:40.610 --> 00:05:41.749
 sculptures 

00:05:41.749 --> 00:05:45.199
 to sensitize the people who receive them 

00:05:45.199 --> 00:05:50.069
 why does your commitment take on at least a more sensitive look at the 

00:05:50.069 --> 00:05:54.339
 our commitment in the interest of the Basque the trees they have in hand produce 

00:05:54.339 --> 00:05:57.339
 a lot of things for our livelihood 

00:05:57.900 --> 00:06:02.349
 bolongongo logo soon larger valletta patient at the party 

00:06:02.349 --> 00:06:04.560
 even the altitude that helping 

00:06:04.560 --> 00:06:09.410
 follows directly from the rouanet law the secretary are about 122 thousand 

00:06:09.410 --> 00:06:10.849
 How are we? 

00:06:10.849 --> 00:06:14.009
 Of course it's the days when we have rain 

00:06:14.009 --> 00:06:17.469
 the book will increase technical activity 

00:06:18.249 --> 00:06:21.249
 I do not have much rainy weather that had happened 

00:06:23.159 --> 00:06:24.989
 and show you with copy
