00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:55.530 
X and I think V and n so like some of

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:57.109 
X and I think V and n so like some of
the<00:01:55.649> most<00:01:55.799> important<00:01:56.250> buttons<00:01:56.520> for<00:01:56.700> me<00:01:56.909> are

the most important buttons for me are

00:01:57.119 --> 00:02:00.490 
the most important buttons for me are
not<00:01:57.930> functional

00:02:00.490 --> 00:02:00.500 
not functional

00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:03.460 
not functional
and<00:02:01.240> that<00:02:02.240> makes<00:02:02.420> it<00:02:02.540> hard<00:02:02.840> because<00:02:03.080> I<00:02:03.230> had<00:02:03.350> to

00:02:03.460 --> 00:02:03.470 
and that makes it hard because I had to

00:02:03.470 --> 00:02:06.190 
and that makes it hard because I had to
rebind<00:02:03.740> them<00:02:03.980> I<00:02:04.160> rebound<00:02:04.910> to<00:02:05.150> get<00:02:05.360> two<00:02:05.630> keys<00:02:05.870> to

00:05:06.370 --> 00:05:06.380 
go if you go without steady aim it is

00:05:06.380 --> 00:05:08.650 
go if you go without steady aim it is
actually<00:05:06.830> a<00:05:06.950> sensible<00:05:07.550> thing<00:05:07.970> is<00:05:08.150> you<00:05:08.480> should

00:05:08.650 --> 00:05:08.660 
actually a sensible thing is you should

00:05:08.660 --> 00:05:12.490 
actually a sensible thing is you should
go<00:05:08.750> practice<00:05:09.020> the<00:05:09.590> 80s<00:05:10.460> retort<00:05:10.880> because<00:05:11.500> you

00:05:12.490 --> 00:05:12.500 
go practice the 80s retort because you

00:05:12.500 --> 00:05:15.220 
go practice the 80s retort because you
