00:00:07.370 --> 00:00:11.790
 hey my dear friends and welcome 

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:13.889
 We o'brien to a new round 

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:16.170
 play on the map engine pluto and 

00:00:13.889 --> 00:00:17.520
 we'll be up here soon because 

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:20.880
 I redeemed a nice pass again 

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:25.350
 I still have five passports with them 

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:28.140
 then yes four o'brien can be and 

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:31.710
 then I will never be on this again 

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:33.059
 play server because oh I do not know 

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:36.270
 how to be so rude to someone 

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:37.770
 so it can help those who are 

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:40.469
 just so friendly to me 

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:41.100
 and I can just as well 

00:00:40.469 --> 00:00:43.410
 do not understand 

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:44.640
 In any case, I would like that from 25 to 25 

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:45.210
 a server then not more 

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:47.010
 support 

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:47.850
 That's why there are the 54 o'brien 

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:50.129
 round and maybe a few more 

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:51.989
 Round as if it was but about it 

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:53.430
 it should not work so that's it 

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:55.050
 I should go but we want here 

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:57.840
 kill the whole server 

00:00:55.050 --> 00:01:01.379
 and there for you first of all this guy 

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:04.350
 her noah, whatever his name is 

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:06.270
 will die first and I have none 

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:09.030
 I know where the damage is 

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:11.040
 I only know that somewhere a sport 

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:13.320
 and that I kill the Chad carrier 

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:15.630
 so i should definitely go for it 

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:18.330
 Of course, everyone should kill here as well 

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:21.780
 kill so and what's he doing up there 

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:23.220
 has been trend so offside is there 

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:26.040
 the back maybe the pity we 

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:27.330
 of course very interesting but looks 

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:30.900
 not as if the city is here 

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:33.689
 or who is you here o'brien 

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:35.549
 So here should be actually there 

00:01:33.689 --> 00:01:37.439
 So I where the start is then the 

00:01:35.549 --> 00:01:39.479
 people of it absolutely the darling too 

00:01:37.439 --> 00:01:43.350
 ketchup or even the city first 

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:44.549
 but well now I will 

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:46.530
 just look at these players here 

00:01:44.549 --> 00:01:49.159
 they stay a bit off the map 

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:49.159
 run around 

00:01:52.820 --> 00:01:55.740
 then I want to say I'm leaving 

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:59.759
 but rather from the players of this 

00:01:55.740 --> 00:02:01.979
 Expiration and the dog that's the evil 

00:01:59.759 --> 00:02:03.210
 I will destroy it first 

00:02:01.979 --> 00:02:06.060
 now he thinks he has to go that height 

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:07.290
 china guest jurors will be finished now 

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:08.819
 can not cope in his life of 

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:10.950
 ddr does not know what to do anymore 

00:02:08.819 --> 00:02:12.450
 that is why he is now then I take 

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:13.560
 take the decision also he knows 

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:14.700
 not what he should do 

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:15.959
 but do not even think about it anymore 

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:16.980
 he should do that you in here in the 

00:02:15.959 --> 00:02:18.780
 space was your biggest mistake 

00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:19.650
 because that only damages you 

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:21.319
 we'll probably get it now 

00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:23.730
 to die 

00:02:21.319 --> 00:02:30.690
 It does not help to run back 

00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:32.250
 and wales are really strong 

00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:34.260
 but they did not help him now 

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:35.790
 so now I wonder too where is that 

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:40.019
 scold or where are the people the 

00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:46.950
 city Ketzin want it is still a 

00:02:40.019 --> 00:02:50.269
 Let's wait and see 

00:02:46.950 --> 00:02:52.769
 maybe someone here a flash 

00:02:50.269 --> 00:02:54.620
 urgent everything is so calm has 

00:02:52.769 --> 00:02:58.349
 to be precise 

00:02:54.620 --> 00:03:05.370
 so here are some people but they have 

00:02:58.349 --> 00:03:06.660
 they do not hurt but also if you the 

00:03:05.370 --> 00:03:07.860
 chance or not is not important 

00:03:06.660 --> 00:03:09.630
 I will die anyway 

00:03:07.860 --> 00:03:11.880
 you still pose a danger to me 

00:03:09.630 --> 00:03:13.590
 there and yes it is true really quiet 

00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:16.590
 no player ran past that 

00:03:13.590 --> 00:03:18.570
 fire crackled and yes otherwise 

00:03:16.590 --> 00:03:20.820
 do not really know what and you die 

00:03:18.570 --> 00:03:24.359
 now there is one for all times 

00:03:20.820 --> 00:03:26.010
 thanks and you too die so me 

00:03:24.359 --> 00:03:27.450
 I also get very little damage and 

00:03:26.010 --> 00:03:28.950
 regenerate me quickly because stop that 

00:03:27.450 --> 00:03:31.739
 city has not yet been fought 

00:03:28.950 --> 00:03:33.359
 first and the survivor so the 

00:03:31.739 --> 00:03:35.400
 actually do not survive at all 

00:03:33.359 --> 00:03:36.690
 can do really harm the 

00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:37.799
 survivor survive then we can 

00:03:36.690 --> 00:03:39.390
 nothing at all if i'm honest 

00:03:37.799 --> 00:03:40.950
 'm just you're going to have any 

00:03:39.390 --> 00:03:42.769
 mitkicken aids but otherwise we are 

00:03:40.950 --> 00:03:45.810
 completely powerless if I'm honest 

00:03:42.769 --> 00:03:48.180
 and now really sad that 

00:03:45.810 --> 00:03:49.680
 her little the city ​​captured because so 

00:03:48.180 --> 00:03:54.000
 that is way too easy for 

00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:59.980
 me if there is only one left you want 

00:03:54.000 --> 00:04:02.980
 again this silence of yes but 

00:03:59.980 --> 00:04:07.769
 no idea i have my item from us 

00:04:02.980 --> 00:04:07.769
 used and then he is already the last 

00:04:07.890 --> 00:04:16.780
 will play with or where did he come from? 

00:04:10.450 --> 00:04:18.519
 poison stink no no it goes away 

00:04:16.780 --> 00:04:19.329
 without god oh my god who is the white 

00:04:18.519 --> 00:04:21.699
 not what he should do 

00:04:19.329 --> 00:04:25.389
 he cares for himself in panic and then comes 

00:04:21.699 --> 00:04:28.150
 the bdp a cult piece no what he do 

00:04:25.389 --> 00:04:32.010
 online.de wm exploded on those 

00:04:28.150 --> 00:04:35.949
 an adolescent new motto, well 

00:04:32.010 --> 00:04:37.960
 somehow that was too easy 

00:04:35.949 --> 00:04:39.310
 I would say that was not 

00:04:37.960 --> 00:04:41.289
 long round we'll see you again soon 

00:04:39.310 --> 00:04:43.300
 in a role as a survivor until 

00:04:41.289 --> 00:04:46.770
 then we would already be in 

00:04:43.300 --> 00:04:51.310
 the round as a survivor on the map 

00:04:46.770 --> 00:04:52.570
 Of course, I 'm not over retreating 

00:04:51.310 --> 00:04:55.810
 i searched brian world when i went through 

00:04:52.570 --> 00:04:57.460
 random would have been simplistic and what 

00:04:55.810 --> 00:04:57.870
 Julian is right at the beginning where is he 

00:04:57.460 --> 00:05:02.169
 because 

00:04:57.870 --> 00:05:04.120
 no no the problem is yes the fans 

00:05:02.169 --> 00:05:08.229
 can also kill emails 

00:05:04.120 --> 00:05:09.550
 that's just the problem and volvo came 

00:05:08.229 --> 00:05:11.260
 the bedburger I'm like me 

00:05:09.550 --> 00:05:13.479
 no idea whence o'brien is 

00:05:11.260 --> 00:05:14.919
 I just barely see any particles here 

00:05:13.479 --> 00:05:16.479
 but here it must be somewhere 

00:05:14.919 --> 00:05:17.680
 In any case, I would say strike 

00:05:16.479 --> 00:05:20.910
 I'm no longer using humor in rom 

00:05:17.680 --> 00:05:24.240
 I go directly to a start of place 

00:05:20.910 --> 00:05:27.970
 so the city might be curious 

00:05:24.240 --> 00:05:29.260
 the sharks point I'll go down that 

00:05:27.970 --> 00:05:32.740
 is the only thing I'm doing 

00:05:29.260 --> 00:05:36.030
 I must first down here so and 

00:05:32.740 --> 00:05:39.570
 Now I have to see where the city is 

00:05:36.030 --> 00:05:39.570
 maybe here 

00:05:41.740 --> 00:05:48.400
 down here or now I clean people 

00:05:44.800 --> 00:05:49.569
 I have the start and I would say so 

00:05:48.400 --> 00:05:50.289
 Give me a break here 

00:05:49.569 --> 00:05:52.389
 up 

00:05:50.289 --> 00:05:55.330
 Thank you for coming to me immediately or 

00:05:52.389 --> 00:05:56.590
 that you supported me speedrun 

00:05:55.330 --> 00:06:01.380
 I'm a little faster with that 

00:05:56.590 --> 00:06:05.319
 am and sprint now what the stuff holds 

00:06:01.380 --> 00:06:09.550
 Sprint and jump somehow with it 

00:06:05.319 --> 00:06:12.610
 we win the victory so stone works 

00:06:09.550 --> 00:06:14.770
 I can capture you in the name speed 

00:06:12.610 --> 00:06:16.810
 ranking the more active drank too 

00:06:14.770 --> 00:06:18.340
 got so and now must now 

00:06:16.810 --> 00:06:19.900
 we need it to take care people fit 

00:06:18.340 --> 00:06:20.680
 we are not many anymore we are 

00:06:19.900 --> 00:06:22.979
 not many anymore 

00:06:20.680 --> 00:06:27.930
 we have to stay together nicely 

00:06:22.979 --> 00:06:32.169
 The guests always nice assembly 

00:06:27.930 --> 00:06:34.949
 want to stay together like that and yes with it 

00:06:32.169 --> 00:06:34.949
 we are still dead here 

00:06:35.009 --> 00:06:39.340
 wonderfully good then I would at this 

00:06:37.419 --> 00:06:40.599
 tell them what you follow them 

00:06:39.340 --> 00:06:42.550
 here at the rhine I just hope that 

00:06:40.599 --> 00:06:44.800
 you the round as only one and also the 

00:06:42.550 --> 00:06:47.110
 Round as a survivor also liked 

00:06:44.800 --> 00:06:48.639
 if the round as survival still there 

00:06:47.110 --> 00:06:50.139
 shorter because it's the wound than the pure 

00:06:48.639 --> 00:06:51.669
 In any case, I have it anyway 

00:06:50.139 --> 00:06:53.080
 that you liked me thank you 

00:06:51.669 --> 00:06:57.690

00:06:53.080 --> 00:06:57.690
 say people until next time
