00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.720
 welcome when the classes 12 

00:00:01.979 --> 00:00:05.250
 and once again we look at the 

00:00:03.720 --> 00:00:07.919
 rc quadrocopter on 

00:00:05.250 --> 00:00:09.360
 however, this will be my last here today 

00:00:07.919 --> 00:00:09.780
 at least in this low price 

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:14.400
 class 

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:17.190
 today I see myself the jj rc jj 600 b 

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:20.310
 threaten to which around the 50 to 60 euro 

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:22.980
 Cost however has at goal.com this 

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:24.000
 currently this video is no longer on 

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:25.859
 their website 

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.990
 but there are very similar to theirs 

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:30.000
 So thank you at gold.com for that 

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:37.020
 send this last rc quadrocopter 

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:38.610
 it at the test report in the box 

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:40.469
 Of course, there is the quadrocopter 

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:43.530
 finally a Swiss 

00:00:40.469 --> 00:00:45.870
 transmitter the usb charging cable and two 

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:48.570
 spare propeller is attending a 

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:50.910
 small usb micro sd card reader also 

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:53.039
 Card reader with an attached 

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:54.899
 micro sd card with a capacity of 

00:00:53.039 --> 00:00:57.600
 512 megabytes 

00:00:54.899 --> 00:00:59.879
 that's huge no, I'm just kidding 

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:01.890
 actually that is pretty small and too 

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:04.110
 Good last a guide in English 

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:06.030
 So look good on the very first look 

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:08.100
 This quadrocopter looks really good, though 

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:10.020
 then I touch them and have to 

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:12.119
 notice that the plastic is very thin 

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:14.640
 and the quality is really not good 

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:16.409
 but at least that's the missing one 

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:18.600
 kind of plastic so this should be 

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:20.130
 Do not break that too fast 

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:22.080
 but thin plastic also has one 

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:24.030
 advantage and that would be the weight 

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:26.220
 it is obviously very easy what 

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:27.720
 means that less power is needed 

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:29.490
 it's going to be in the air around that head 

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:31.380
 but on the other hand it will get one 

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:33.090
 little difficult this copter in 

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:33.840
 windy conditions stable in the 

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:35.850
 to keep air 

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:37.619
 However, because of the low weight as 

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:39.869
 Beginners should not drone at 

00:01:37.619 --> 00:01:41.280
 In such circumstances, the axes fly 

00:01:39.869 --> 00:01:42.960
 but are relatively stable 

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:44.490
 and the same goes for the propellers 

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:46.290
 wing that will probably be the reason 

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:47.939
 be that only two as 

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:49.439
 propeller instead of four included 

00:01:47.939 --> 00:01:52.079
 when we look at the bottom 

00:01:49.439 --> 00:01:53.549
 this quadrocopter sun now see this 

00:01:52.079 --> 00:01:55.409
 does not look good 

00:01:53.549 --> 00:01:58.049
 a little happy and cheap if you like me 

00:01:55.409 --> 00:02:00.119
 but hey asks the price is also low 

00:01:58.049 --> 00:02:03.149
 nevertheless, I drone on all of them 

00:02:00.119 --> 00:02:05.549
 so far, this jj has 600 b 

00:02:03.149 --> 00:02:07.110
 here the best functionality for 

00:02:05.549 --> 00:02:08.819
 example, there is no nice here 

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:09.899
 battery cover or so which one 

00:02:08.819 --> 00:02:11.600
 probably not anymore anyway 

00:02:09.899 --> 00:02:13.130
 could get and close 

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:15.440
 instead, the battery will be here 

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:17.360
 wedged in between and keeps it that way 

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:20.180
 in the square with the help of these plastic ducks 

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:22.100
 on both sides of this 

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:24.110
 quadrocopter is with a 380 

00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:24.860
 milli-hour lithium polymer battery 

00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:26.480
 fitted 

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:28.460
 This should be for a flight of 

00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:30.290
 about five minutes or to reach 

00:02:28.460 --> 00:02:31.850
 To turn on this drone you climb 

00:02:30.290 --> 00:02:33.620
 simply the battery in this connection 

00:02:31.850 --> 00:02:35.210
 one in front here he is one by the way 

00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:37.430
 camera with this one should 

00:02:35.210 --> 00:02:39.050
 can photograph and film the 

00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:41.120
 quality I show you a little bit 

00:02:39.050 --> 00:02:42.950
 later the footage will be on the 

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:43.910
 micro sd card saved the 

00:02:42.950 --> 00:02:45.800
 is included 

00:02:43.910 --> 00:02:47.270
 there is the card slot in which one the 

00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:48.920
 microsd card installed 

00:02:47.270 --> 00:02:50.420
 Unfortunately, I have no idea what 

00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:51.980
 this connection is behind here 

00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:54.020
 probably for such a kind of module 

00:02:51.980 --> 00:02:56.090
 for different quadrocopter models 

00:02:54.020 --> 00:02:58.610
 as soon as the drone hits the top ten for the first time 

00:02:56.090 --> 00:03:00.500
 red and blue colors could therefore be 

00:02:58.610 --> 00:03:04.120
 you can fly with it in the dark , too 

00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:04.120
 now the volume 

00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:15.269
 yes that would be it for the drone I think 

00:03:12.989 --> 00:03:17.400
 The transmitter is finally black 

00:03:15.269 --> 00:03:20.310
 but is still relatively simple, the 

00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:22.530
 means four channels and 2.4 ghz the 

00:03:20.310 --> 00:03:24.390
 proportion of flats are opened and the 

00:03:22.530 --> 00:03:25.830
 throttle is on the left side 

00:03:24.390 --> 00:03:28.709
 this time for here for example 

00:03:25.830 --> 00:03:30.569
 are the photo and video buttons for photos 

00:03:28.709 --> 00:03:31.170
 and videos with the quadrocopter camera 

00:03:30.569 --> 00:03:33.239
 take 

00:03:31.170 --> 00:03:34.920
 the transmitter needs four doppler 

00:03:33.239 --> 00:03:36.629
 Batteries we now fly this 

00:03:34.920 --> 00:03:38.340
 I always bought as usual 

00:03:36.629 --> 00:03:40.680
 bad at flying such things though 

00:03:38.340 --> 00:03:42.299
 So I have to say this to a beginner 

00:03:40.680 --> 00:03:42.900
 is the easiest drone to date 

00:03:42.299 --> 00:03:44.519
 fly 

00:03:42.900 --> 00:03:46.319
 I would love to have some extremis 

00:03:44.519 --> 00:03:48.569
 want to try dance but I want 

00:03:46.319 --> 00:03:50.549
 not that the drone breaks because of me 

00:03:48.569 --> 00:03:52.590
 have no experience and not 

00:03:50.549 --> 00:03:54.810
 I want to crash immediately 

00:03:52.590 --> 00:03:56.370
 just avoid them and fly them safely 

00:03:54.810 --> 00:03:57.720
 Camera quality is surprisingly 

00:03:56.370 --> 00:03:59.459
 not so bad 

00:03:57.720 --> 00:04:01.440
 Generally, the quality can be considered as 

00:03:59.459 --> 00:04:03.989
 bad but at least 

00:04:01.440 --> 00:04:05.700
 you can still recognize the objects and 

00:04:03.989 --> 00:04:07.140
 The frame rate is good and stable 

00:04:05.700 --> 00:04:09.090
 So I would say the footage 

00:04:07.140 --> 00:04:11.519
 is usable as long as you do not 

00:04:09.090 --> 00:04:13.260
 high quality needs and yes what can I 

00:04:11.519 --> 00:04:16.019
 say here for the price of around 

00:04:13.260 --> 00:04:17.820
 50 to 60 euros not bad the 

00:04:16.019 --> 00:04:19.380
 Propeller wings are about protected 

00:04:17.820 --> 00:04:20.970
 and this drone cares 

00:04:19.380 --> 00:04:22.979
 surprisingly much better than that 

00:04:20.970 --> 00:04:23.669
 last quadrocopter so tested you 

00:04:22.979 --> 00:04:25.560
 have 

00:04:23.669 --> 00:04:27.750
 the flight time is okay the 

00:04:25.560 --> 00:04:29.460
 quality of course, super cheap but it 

00:04:27.750 --> 00:04:33.120
 everything works for a beginner 

00:04:29.460 --> 00:04:35.130
 rc quadrocopter i want this jrc jj 

00:04:33.120 --> 00:04:37.800
 600 b, in fact, to try 

00:04:35.130 --> 00:04:39.900
 recommend again thank you your gold.com 

00:04:37.800 --> 00:04:42.000
 for that to be this product for the 

00:04:39.900 --> 00:04:44.250
 partly report thanks for watching 

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:46.919
 do not forget to subscribe and visit 

00:04:44.250 --> 00:04:48.990
 the class of sex.com and there videos 

00:04:46.919 --> 00:04:51.240
 seen on youtube also said no to 

00:04:48.990 --> 00:04:53.130
 block a to support me and um
