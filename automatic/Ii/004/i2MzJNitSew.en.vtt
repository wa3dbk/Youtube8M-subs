y'all in a little bit after i put the
second<00:01:41.689> one<00:01:41.840> on<00:01:41.869> it's<00:01:42.380> actually<00:01:42.890> kind<00:01:43.070> of

00:01:43.149 --> 00:01:43.159 
second one on it's actually kind of

00:01:43.159 --> 00:01:45.309 
second one on it's actually kind of
bending<00:01:43.579> to<00:01:43.850> fit<00:01:44.119> the<00:01:44.270> case<00:01:44.509> which<00:01:44.899> is<00:01:45.079> really

00:01:45.309 --> 00:01:45.319 
bending to fit the case which is really

00:01:45.319 --> 00:01:47.529 
bending to fit the case which is really
good<00:01:45.530> at<00:01:45.619> dutch<00:01:45.770> an<00:01:45.920> overlap<00:01:46.579> or<00:01:46.850> anything

00:01:47.529 --> 00:01:47.539 
good at dutch an overlap or anything

00:01:47.539 --> 00:01:49.600 
good at dutch an overlap or anything
which<00:01:48.109> really<00:01:48.560> makes<00:01:48.829> me<00:01:49.069> happy<00:01:49.189> because<00:01:49.429> i

00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:49.610 
which really makes me happy because i

00:01:49.610 --> 00:01:51.669 
which really makes me happy because i
really<00:01:49.969> didn't<00:01:50.179> want<00:01:50.329> it<00:01:50.420> to<00:01:50.509> do<00:01:50.679> go

00:01:51.669 --> 00:01:51.679 
really didn't want it to do go

00:01:51.679 --> 00:01:54.969 
really didn't want it to do go
overlapping<00:01:52.340> so<00:01:53.060> there's<00:01:54.020> a<00:01:54.140> big<00:01:54.439> plus<00:01:54.740> guy

00:01:54.969 --> 00:01:54.979 
overlapping so there's a big plus guy

00:01:54.979 --> 00:01:56.679 
overlapping so there's a big plus guy
that<00:01:55.159> I<00:01:55.189> mean<00:01:55.429> it<00:01:55.520> kind<00:01:55.729> of<00:01:55.789> overlaps<00:01:56.240> just<00:01:56.600> a

00:01:56.679 --> 00:01:56.689 
that I mean it kind of overlaps just a

00:01:56.689 --> 00:01:58.389 
that I mean it kind of overlaps just a
little<00:01:56.959> bit<00:01:57.079> there<00:01:57.259> but<00:01:57.409> I<00:01:57.469> can't<00:01:57.799> peel<00:01:58.069> it<00:01:58.250> off

00:01:58.389 --> 00:01:58.399 
little bit there but I can't peel it off

00:01:58.399 --> 00:02:00.639 
little bit there but I can't peel it off
because<00:01:58.969> it<00:01:59.090> actually<00:01:59.390> goes<00:01:59.780> on<00:01:59.959> to<00:02:00.200> the<00:02:00.289> up

00:02:00.639 --> 00:02:00.649 
because it actually goes on to the up

00:02:00.649 --> 00:02:03.850 
because it actually goes on to the up
for<00:02:01.549> the<00:02:01.869> backside<00:02:02.869> of<00:02:02.899> the<00:02:03.140> case<00:02:03.380> so<00:02:03.709> I'm

00:02:03.850 --> 00:02:03.860 
for the backside of the case so I'm

00:02:03.860 --> 00:02:06.580 
for the backside of the case so I'm
gonna<00:02:04.009> put<00:02:04.250> this<00:02:04.310> realtree<00:02:05.119> one<00:02:05.450> on<00:02:05.630> love

00:02:06.580 --> 00:02:06.590 
gonna put this realtree one on love

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:08.410 
gonna put this realtree one on love
realtree<00:02:07.280> outfitters<00:02:07.849> but<00:02:08.149> i'm<00:02:08.209> not<00:02:08.360> really

00:02:08.410 --> 00:02:08.420

where<00:02:11.660> i<00:02:11.690> can<00:02:11.989> actually<00:02:12.019> fit<00:02:12.860> this<00:02:13.160> before<00:02:13.940> i

00:02:14.289 --> 00:02:14.299 
where i can actually fit this before i

00:02:14.299 --> 00:02:16.720 
where i can actually fit this before i
put<00:02:15.110> it<00:02:15.200> on<00:02:15.319> so<00:02:15.560> it<00:02:15.709> can't<00:02:15.980> go<00:02:16.160> there<00:02:16.430> obviously

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:16.730 
put it on so it can't go there obviously

00:02:16.730 --> 00:02:21.400 
put it on so it can't go there obviously
good<00:02:17.510> job<00:02:17.750> so<00:02:18.560> i<00:02:19.480> think<00:02:20.480> i<00:02:20.690> can<00:02:20.900> fit<00:02:21.110> it<00:02:21.230> right

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:21.410 
good job so i think i can fit it right

00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:27.009 
good job so i think i can fit it right
