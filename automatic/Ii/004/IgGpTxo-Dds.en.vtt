00:00:02.090 --> 00:00:04.700 

there<00:00:03.090> are<00:00:03.240> three<00:00:03.480> fly-tying<00:00:03.929> skills<00:00:04.410> that

00:00:04.700 --> 00:00:04.710 
there are three fly-tying skills that

00:00:04.710 --> 00:00:06.380 
there are three fly-tying skills that
are<00:00:04.799> common<00:00:05.190> to<00:00:05.310> every<00:00:05.339> fly<00:00:05.940> that<00:00:06.150> you'll<00:00:06.270> ever

00:00:06.380 --> 00:00:06.390 
are common to every fly that you'll ever

00:00:06.390 --> 00:00:08.330 
are common to every fly that you'll ever
tie<00:00:06.690> and<00:00:06.990> there<00:00:07.680> are<00:00:07.770> skills<00:00:08.040> that<00:00:08.220> you're

00:00:08.330 --> 00:00:08.340 
tie and there are skills that you're

00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:10.250 
tie and there are skills that you're
going<00:00:08.610> to<00:00:08.730> want<00:00:08.910> to<00:00:08.970> master<00:00:09.480> in<00:00:09.719> order<00:00:09.870> to<00:00:10.110> tie

00:00:10.250 --> 00:00:10.260 
going to want to master in order to tie

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:13.280 
going to want to master in order to tie
effective<00:00:10.740> flies<00:00:11.389> the<00:00:12.389> three<00:00:12.630> skills<00:00:12.900> are<00:00:13.139> the

00:00:13.280 --> 00:00:13.290 
effective flies the three skills are the

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:16.519 
effective flies the three skills are the
jam<00:00:13.530> not<00:00:13.849> the<00:00:14.849> pinch<00:00:15.120> wrap<00:00:15.389> and<00:00:15.660> the<00:00:16.379> whip

00:00:16.519 --> 00:00:16.529 
jam not the pinch wrap and the whip

00:00:16.529 --> 00:00:19.370 
jam not the pinch wrap and the whip
finish<00:00:16.920> and<00:00:17.190> they<00:00:18.150> basically<00:00:18.359> correspond<00:00:19.140> to

00:00:19.370 --> 00:00:19.380 
finish and they basically correspond to

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:22.880 
finish and they basically correspond to
as<00:00:20.010> I<00:00:20.699> said<00:00:20.760> the<00:00:21.060> three<00:00:21.350> steps<00:00:22.350> of<00:00:22.560> the<00:00:22.619> fly

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:22.890 
as I said the three steps of the fly

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:25.939 
as I said the three steps of the fly
that<00:00:23.550> are<00:00:23.640> common<00:00:23.910> to<00:00:24.029> every<00:00:24.060> fly<00:00:24.510> one<00:00:25.380> you

00:00:25.939 --> 00:00:25.949 
that are common to every fly one you

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:27.439 
that are common to every fly one you
need<00:00:26.130> to<00:00:26.220> attach<00:00:26.490> the<00:00:26.670> thread<00:00:26.910> to<00:00:27.240> the<00:00:27.269> hook

00:00:27.439 --> 00:00:27.449 
need to attach the thread to the hook

00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:31.429 
need to attach the thread to the hook
and<00:00:27.779> that's<00:00:28.590> done<00:00:29.279> using<00:00:29.460> a<00:00:29.640> jam<00:00:29.880> not<00:00:30.170> two<00:00:31.170> you

00:00:31.429 --> 00:00:31.439 
and that's done using a jam not two you

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:33.290 
and that's done using a jam not two you
need<00:00:31.590> to<00:00:31.650> attach<00:00:31.980> material<00:00:32.669> to<00:00:32.820> the<00:00:32.940> hook<00:00:33.090> and

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:33.300 
need to attach material to the hook and

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:35.810 
need to attach material to the hook and
that's<00:00:33.989> done<00:00:34.290> primarily<00:00:34.710> using<00:00:35.309> a<00:00:35.370> pinch<00:00:35.610> wrap

00:00:35.810 --> 00:00:35.820 
that's done primarily using a pinch wrap

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:40.160 
that's done primarily using a pinch wrap
and<00:00:36.710> three<00:00:37.910> when<00:00:38.910> your<00:00:39.059> fly<00:00:39.239> is<00:00:39.270> finished<00:00:39.840> you

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:40.170 
and three when your fly is finished you

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:42.020 
and three when your fly is finished you
need<00:00:40.320> to<00:00:40.530> secure<00:00:41.040> your<00:00:41.250> thread<00:00:41.489> to<00:00:41.520> the<00:00:41.730> hook

00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:42.030 
need to secure your thread to the hook

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:43.700 
need to secure your thread to the hook
before<00:00:42.239> clipping<00:00:42.780> the<00:00:42.870> thread<00:00:43.110> off<00:00:43.350> and

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:43.710 
before clipping the thread off and

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:46.610 
before clipping the thread off and
that's<00:00:44.370> done<00:00:44.610> with<00:00:44.820> a<00:00:44.850> whip<00:00:45.059> finish<00:00:45.440> so<00:00:46.440> let's

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:46.620 
that's done with a whip finish so let's

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:49.250 
that's done with a whip finish so let's
go<00:00:46.770> through<00:00:46.980> these<00:00:47.100> one<00:00:47.160> by<00:00:47.370> one<00:00:48.170> let's<00:00:49.170> start

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:49.260 
go through these one by one let's start

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:51.500 
go through these one by one let's start
with<00:00:49.530> the<00:00:49.620> jam<00:00:49.860> knot<00:00:50.100> which<00:00:50.850> is<00:00:51.000> used<00:00:51.210> for

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:51.510 
with the jam knot which is used for

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:54.529 
with the jam knot which is used for
attaching<00:00:51.840> your<00:00:52.110> thread<00:00:52.410> to<00:00:52.620> the<00:00:52.649> hook<00:00:53.390> to<00:00:54.390> tie

00:00:54.529 --> 00:00:54.539 
attaching your thread to the hook to tie

00:00:54.539 --> 00:00:57.470 
attaching your thread to the hook to tie
a<00:00:54.570> jam<00:00:54.930> knot<00:00:55.670> or<00:00:56.670> to<00:00:56.820> start<00:00:57.030> your<00:00:57.090> thread<00:00:57.360> on

00:00:57.470 --> 00:00:57.480

let go your bobbin and your thread is
now<00:01:26.009> attached<00:01:26.369> to<00:01:26.549> the<00:01:26.640> hook<00:01:28.070> so<00:01:29.070> that's<00:01:29.250> how

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:29.400 
now attached to the hook so that's how

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:33.410 
now attached to the hook so that's how
to<00:01:29.430> complete<00:01:29.790> a<00:01:29.820> jam<00:01:30.119> knot<00:01:31.939> now<00:01:32.939> let's<00:01:33.210> clip

00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:33.420 
to complete a jam knot now let's clip

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:38.450 
to complete a jam knot now let's clip
this<00:01:33.570> tag<00:01:33.810> end<00:01:34.049> off<00:01:34.229> and<00:01:36.229> let's<00:01:37.250> show<00:01:38.250> how<00:01:38.400> to

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:38.460 
this tag end off and let's show how to

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:41.899 
this tag end off and let's show how to
do<00:01:38.610> a<00:01:38.640> pinch<00:01:38.909> wrap<00:01:39.150> a<00:01:39.390> pinch<00:01:40.259> wrap<00:01:40.470> is<00:01:41.400> used<00:01:41.759> to

00:01:41.899 --> 00:01:41.909 
do a pinch wrap a pinch wrap is used to

00:01:41.909 --> 00:01:44.179 
do a pinch wrap a pinch wrap is used to
secure<00:01:42.090> material<00:01:42.450> to<00:01:42.930> the<00:01:43.079> hook<00:01:43.229> there<00:01:44.070> are

00:01:44.179 --> 00:01:44.189 
secure material to the hook there are

00:01:44.189 --> 00:01:46.069 
secure material to the hook there are
many<00:01:44.369> different<00:01:44.850> techniques<00:01:45.180> to<00:01:45.479> apply

00:01:46.069 --> 00:01:46.079 
many different techniques to apply

00:01:46.079 --> 00:01:47.719 
many different techniques to apply
materials<00:01:46.649> to<00:01:46.770> the<00:01:46.860> hook<00:01:46.979> the<00:01:47.100> jam<00:01:47.310> knot<00:01:47.549> I'm

00:01:47.719 --> 00:01:47.729 
materials to the hook the jam knot I'm

00:01:47.729 --> 00:01:49.850 
materials to the hook the jam knot I'm
sorry<00:01:48.060> the<00:01:48.210> pinch<00:01:48.869> wrap<00:01:49.049> is<00:01:49.259> the<00:01:49.439> basic

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:49.860 
sorry the pinch wrap is the basic

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:52.550 
sorry the pinch wrap is the basic
technique<00:01:50.899> so<00:01:51.899> we're<00:01:52.079> going<00:01:52.200> to<00:01:52.259> take<00:01:52.439> this

00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:52.560 
technique so we're going to take this

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:54.920 
technique so we're going to take this
grizzly<00:01:52.950> feather<00:01:53.270> and<00:01:54.270> we<00:01:54.479> want<00:01:54.630> to<00:01:54.689> attach

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:54.930 
grizzly feather and we want to attach

00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:59.450 
grizzly feather and we want to attach
this<00:01:55.259> material<00:01:56.100> to<00:01:56.340> the<00:01:56.490> hook<00:01:58.100> so<00:01:59.100> you<00:01:59.159> start

00:01:59.450 --> 00:01:59.460 
this material to the hook so you start

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:00.859 
this material to the hook so you start
by<00:01:59.490> positioning<00:02:00.060> the<00:02:00.119> material<00:02:00.630> where<00:02:00.750> you'd

00:02:00.859 --> 00:02:00.869 
by positioning the material where you'd

00:02:00.869 --> 00:02:01.450 
by positioning the material where you'd
like<00:02:01.020> it<00:02:01.170> to<00:02:01.259> be

00:02:01.450 --> 00:02:01.460 
like it to be

00:02:01.460 --> 00:02:03.980 
like it to be
I'd<00:02:02.460> like<00:02:02.640> this<00:02:02.790> feather<00:02:03.030> to<00:02:03.479> lie<00:02:03.630> along<00:02:03.750> the

00:02:03.980 --> 00:02:03.990

we're going to repeat that one or two
more<00:02:50.040> times<00:02:55.370> and<00:02:56.370> when<00:02:56.490> we<00:02:56.610> let<00:02:56.760> go<00:02:58.220> we<00:02:59.220> see<00:02:59.400> we

00:02:59.510 --> 00:02:59.520 
more times and when we let go we see we

00:02:59.520 --> 00:03:01.940 
more times and when we let go we see we
have<00:02:59.670> that<00:02:59.910> feather<00:03:00.270> attached<00:03:00.900> exactly<00:03:01.800> where

00:03:05.240 --> 00:03:05.250 
we want it to be using the pinch raft

00:03:05.250 --> 00:03:09.350 
we want it to be using the pinch raft
technique<00:03:07.520> now<00:03:08.520> let's<00:03:08.730> remove<00:03:08.970> the<00:03:09.150> feather

00:03:09.350 --> 00:03:09.360 
technique now let's remove the feather

00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:14.380 
technique now let's remove the feather
and<00:03:11.090> let's<00:03:12.090> talk<00:03:12.270> about<00:03:12.420> doing<00:03:12.840> a<00:03:12.930> whip<00:03:13.080> finish

00:03:14.380 --> 00:03:14.390 
and let's talk about doing a whip finish

00:03:14.390 --> 00:03:17.030 
and let's talk about doing a whip finish
now<00:03:15.390> a<00:03:15.420> whip<00:03:15.750> finish<00:03:16.050> takes<00:03:16.290> some<00:03:16.440> practice<00:03:16.620> to

00:03:17.030 --> 00:03:17.040 
now a whip finish takes some practice to

00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:23.600 
now a whip finish takes some practice to
do<00:03:18.500> but<00:03:19.500> as<00:03:19.650> I<00:03:19.770> said<00:03:19.830> in<00:03:20.190> a<00:03:20.450> prior<00:03:21.450> segment<00:03:22.610> it's

00:03:23.600 --> 00:03:23.610 
do but as I said in a prior segment it's

00:03:23.610 --> 00:03:24.980 
do but as I said in a prior segment it's
like<00:03:23.820> riding<00:03:24.090> a<00:03:24.120> bike<00:03:24.240> once<00:03:24.510> you<00:03:24.600> get<00:03:24.750> it<00:03:24.870> you

00:03:24.980 --> 00:03:24.990 
like riding a bike once you get it you

00:03:24.990 --> 00:03:27.470 
like riding a bike once you get it you
get<00:03:25.110> it<00:03:25.850> we're<00:03:26.850> going<00:03:26.940> to<00:03:27.000> use<00:03:27.060> our<00:03:27.300> whip

00:03:27.470 --> 00:03:27.480 
get it we're going to use our whip

00:03:27.480 --> 00:03:29.590 
get it we're going to use our whip
finish<00:03:27.840> tool<00:03:28.310> okay

now<00:03:30.600> this<00:03:31.110> tool<00:03:32.810> is<00:03:33.810> basically<00:03:34.440> the<00:03:34.800> metal

00:03:35.150 --> 00:03:35.160 
now this tool is basically the metal

00:03:35.160 --> 00:03:37.370 
now this tool is basically the metal
shank<00:03:35.459> here<00:03:35.640> this<00:03:35.820> is<00:03:35.940> a<00:03:35.970> tube<00:03:36.300> here<00:03:36.570> upon

00:03:37.370 --> 00:03:37.380 
shank here this is a tube here upon

shank here this is a tube here upon
which<00:03:37.590> the<00:03:38.250> rest<00:03:38.459> of<00:03:38.610> this<00:03:38.760> will<00:03:38.940> spin<00:03:39.240> so<00:03:40.050> what

00:03:40.160 --> 00:03:40.170 
which the rest of this will spin so what

00:03:40.170 --> 00:03:41.270 
which the rest of this will spin so what
you<00:03:40.290> want<00:03:40.440> to<00:03:40.500> do<00:03:40.590> is<00:03:40.709> you<00:03:40.800> want<00:03:40.950> to<00:03:41.010> kind<00:03:41.220> of

four now the idea here this will leave
you<00:04:18.030> with<00:04:18.180> a<00:04:18.239> horizontal<00:04:18.690> piece<00:04:19.200> of<00:04:19.380> thread

00:04:19.580 --> 00:04:19.590 
you with a horizontal piece of thread

00:04:19.590 --> 00:04:23.150 
you with a horizontal piece of thread
and<00:04:19.830> a<00:04:20.520> vertical<00:04:20.730> piece<00:04:21.090> of<00:04:21.330> thread<00:04:21.539> and<00:04:22.160> what

00:04:23.150 --> 00:04:23.160 
and a vertical piece of thread and what

00:04:23.160 --> 00:04:25.250 
and a vertical piece of thread and what
you<00:04:23.280> want<00:04:23.430> to<00:04:23.490> do<00:04:23.610> is<00:04:23.850> take<00:04:24.510> this<00:04:24.660> horizontal

00:04:25.250 --> 00:04:25.260 
you want to do is take this horizontal

00:04:25.260 --> 00:04:26.510 
you want to do is take this horizontal
piece<00:04:25.410> of<00:04:25.560> thread<00:04:25.800> and

00:04:26.510 --> 00:04:26.520 
piece of thread and

00:04:26.520 --> 00:04:29.150 
piece of thread and
Hinch<00:04:26.639> it<00:04:27.080> against<00:04:28.080> the<00:04:28.169> hook<00:04:28.349> shank<00:04:28.560> with

00:04:29.150 --> 00:04:29.160 
Hinch it against the hook shank with

00:04:29.160 --> 00:04:31.100 
Hinch it against the hook shank with
successive<00:04:29.550> wraps<00:04:29.940> and<00:04:30.300> that<00:04:30.449> in<00:04:30.629> essence<00:04:30.960> is

00:04:31.100 --> 00:04:31.110 
successive wraps and that in essence is

00:04:31.110 --> 00:04:34.999 
successive wraps and that in essence is
a<00:04:31.139> whip<00:04:31.319> finish<00:04:32.539> so<00:04:33.539> we're<00:04:34.289> going<00:04:34.470> to<00:04:34.620> do<00:04:34.830> that

00:04:34.999 --> 00:04:35.009 
a whip finish so we're going to do that

00:04:35.009 --> 00:04:36.379 
a whip finish so we're going to do that
we're<00:04:35.159> going<00:04:35.250> to<00:04:35.310> manipulate<00:04:35.879> this<00:04:36.060> thread

00:04:36.379 --> 00:04:36.389 
we're going to manipulate this thread

00:04:36.389 --> 00:04:38.839 
we're going to manipulate this thread
kind<00:04:36.659> of<00:04:36.750> let<00:04:36.870> it<00:04:36.900> slide<00:04:37.229> back<00:04:37.560> to<00:04:37.860> where<00:04:38.729> the

00:04:38.839 --> 00:04:38.849 
kind of let it slide back to where the

00:04:38.849 --> 00:04:40.040 
kind of let it slide back to where the
threads<00:04:39.090> lying<00:04:39.330> along<00:04:39.569> the<00:04:39.690> shank<00:04:39.900> of<00:04:39.990> the

00:05:27.680 --> 00:05:27.690 
created a whip finish let's demonstrate

00:05:27.690 --> 00:05:31.580 
created a whip finish let's demonstrate
that<00:05:28.050> again<00:05:29.419> because<00:05:30.419> it<00:05:30.719> is<00:05:30.750> a<00:05:30.870> difficult<00:05:31.139> not

00:05:31.580 --> 00:05:31.590 
that again because it is a difficult not

00:05:31.590 --> 00:05:35.990 
that again because it is a difficult not
to<00:05:31.800> master<00:05:33.680> hold<00:05:34.680> your<00:05:34.860> whip<00:05:34.979> finisher<00:05:35.430> hold

00:05:35.990 --> 00:05:36.000 
to master hold your whip finisher hold

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:37.399 
to master hold your whip finisher hold

00:05:37.399 --> 00:05:37.409 
the ball of the whip finisher so it

00:05:37.409 --> 00:05:40.490 
the ball of the whip finisher so it
doesn't<00:05:37.680> swivel<00:05:38.810> catch<00:05:39.810> the<00:05:40.020> thread<00:05:40.259> in<00:05:40.409> the
