00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:22.990 
going to sew it and I'm just going to do

00:02:22.990 --> 00:02:26.670 
going to sew it and I'm just going to do
a<00:02:23.020> little<00:02:23.290> tiny<00:02:23.590> X<00:02:24.690> just<00:02:25.690> to<00:02:25.840> keep<00:02:26.050> it<00:02:26.260> in<00:02:26.380> place

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:26.680 
a little tiny X just to keep it in place

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:28.860 
a little tiny X just to keep it in place
and<00:02:27.280> I'm<00:02:27.459> using<00:02:27.640> white<00:02:27.970> thread<00:02:28.330> so<00:02:28.630> that<00:02:28.660> it

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:28.870 
and I'm using white thread so that it

00:02:28.870 --> 00:02:32.280 
and I'm using white thread so that it
doesn't<00:02:29.260> show<00:02:30.540> through<00:02:31.540> black<00:02:31.930> on<00:02:32.140> the<00:02:32.260> other

00:02:42.590 --> 00:02:42.600 
so that's what it looks like when it's

00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:50.490 
so that's what it looks like when it's
finished

00:02:50.490 --> 00:02:50.500 

00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:52.470

00:03:02.190 --> 00:03:02.200 
to trim these pieces so we don't want

00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:13.619
