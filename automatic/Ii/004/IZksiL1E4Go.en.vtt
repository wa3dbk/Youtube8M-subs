00:00:00.570 --> 00:00:03.689
 very good kids here we are a 

00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:06.390
 new video is everything I'll show you a 

00:00:03.689 --> 00:00:08.130
 little bit what is the quick scope and how 

00:00:06.390 --> 00:00:09.809
 and kiti the ends to use to 

00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:12.269
 it's good we're in private first thing 

00:00:09.809 --> 00:00:14.309
 and let's do the classes we go to the 

00:00:12.269 --> 00:00:15.749
 classes fret today here prepared fixes 

00:00:14.309 --> 00:00:17.189
 well a little first I'm just going to 

00:00:15.749 --> 00:00:19.769
 teach if first and then ask 

00:00:17.189 --> 00:00:21.480
 little by little the two weapons that can be 

00:00:19.769 --> 00:00:25.199
 use well to do will scope are 

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:27.119
 usb and l11 5 ok 

00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:29.539
 these two weapons are the only ones that do 

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:32.780
 what tax because then it is 

00:00:29.539 --> 00:00:34.699
 and then there are these two here who are 

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:36.170
 very heavy and I do not like them for 

00:00:34.699 --> 00:00:38.480
 nothing and you either you will like 

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:40.790
 and these are the most agile and the best 

00:00:38.480 --> 00:00:43.250
 I believe so we go the first class 

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:45.680
 we have to put the usb with chargers 

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:48.110
 great because this weapon is almost 

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:49.699
 always killed by a bullet is very good 

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:53.089
 although you do not have tiny life though 

00:00:49.699 --> 00:00:56.149
 is not extreme either and then for 

00:00:53.089 --> 00:00:58.339
 secondary I put you the p of w vale 

00:00:56.149 --> 00:01:00.110
 because because it has a burst of 3 and 

00:00:58.339 --> 00:01:03.439
 so if you give a hit marker now to 

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:05.630
 12 give him a blast and you kill him is a 

00:01:03.439 --> 00:01:07.400
 advantage that you have is this weapon that by 

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:09.049
 example is a hit marker or you have a 

00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:11.330
 unexpectedly unexpected and you have to 

00:01:09.049 --> 00:01:12.830
 get it out quickly with a flurry or two 

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:15.500
 You already have him dead, and you do not have to 

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:17.030
 give many times to the button to the euro then 

00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:19.970
 of lethal because this you have to choose 

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:21.259
 you always put such a lethal and 

00:01:19.970 --> 00:01:23.780
 to me the people that I do not like in this 

00:01:21.259 --> 00:01:25.369
 game I always use fragmentation and 

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:27.680
 then tactical has shocked now 

00:01:25.369 --> 00:01:31.070
 It's worth after advantage is very important 

00:01:27.680 --> 00:01:31.430
 catch precipitation but seriously said 

00:01:31.070 --> 00:01:34.400
 wrong 

00:01:31.430 --> 00:01:36.030
 then hunter and quick-drawn 

00:01:34.400 --> 00:01:39.240
 these three are indispensable 

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:41.159
 to make a perfect quick choke like this or 

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:42.930
 be very good to be very comfortable and 

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:44.759
 then the next class is the same 

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:47.460
 practice between it with the same 

00:01:44.759 --> 00:01:49.979
 advantages but with this weapon with the l11 5 

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:52.440
 it is the same I do not always put 

00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:54.509
 extended chargers because it's not that 

00:01:52.440 --> 00:01:56.909
 I'm worth putting the thermals neither 

00:01:54.509 --> 00:01:59.220
 some do not zoom because they're not going to do 

00:01:56.909 --> 00:02:02.130
 scott are not going to aim and this and 

00:01:59.220 --> 00:02:03.960
 these weapons have the viewer very close 

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:06.330
 towards him or she has a lot of blue so 

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:07.860
 it is not necessary and well you have already seen this 

00:02:06.330 --> 00:02:09.840
 let's move on to another part 

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:12.120
 now let's move on to theme bots vale 

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:13.920
 to start handling the quick a bit 

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:15.750
 scope if you do not have much idea of others 

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:17.550
 call of duty none of that first thing you 

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:19.620
 you should put a few bots 

00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:21.870
 against you to start taking a 

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:24.810
 little game with the controller and with it 

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:26.940
 with the game it's worth it and well you put it in 

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:29.700
 recruit so that you do not have 

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:32.790
 problems of none and good you take the 

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:35.040
 smaller I have chosen this and you already give it 

00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:36.660
 start and well then we continue with the 

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:39.209
 tutorial and now I'm going to show you a 

00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:41.280
 little both the two options that 

00:02:39.209 --> 00:02:42.510
 you have the first one let's go 

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:45.660
 the sensitivity that is very important 

00:02:42.510 --> 00:02:48.090
 you have to put the very high you have to 

00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:51.959
 control it I have it at 12 in the most 

00:02:48.090 --> 00:02:54.330
 high is 10 to 20 I have it 12 

00:02:51.959 --> 00:02:56.580
 neither is it too excessive to do it 

00:02:54.330 --> 00:02:58.380
 very high but good to 12 is very good 

00:02:56.580 --> 00:02:59.760
 I use it and it works well for me 

00:02:58.380 --> 00:03:02.580
 that I'm not going to explain now two 

00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:04.560
 important steps that are the quisco that 

00:03:02.580 --> 00:03:06.480
 you know what it is that is very easy as 

00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:08.250
 You see there is no crosshead if this time in this 

00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:09.930
 The way to the crosshead is that there 

00:03:08.250 --> 00:03:12.480
 in the middle then what you have to 

00:03:09.930 --> 00:03:14.070
 to make the club is that it does not look fair or 

00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:16.590
 be that the enemy is seen but that 

00:03:14.070 --> 00:03:20.670
 see the peephole then the quisco that 

00:03:16.590 --> 00:03:23.730
 would this be worth that will be the pisco is 

00:03:20.670 --> 00:03:26.250
 kill him without more know point a shot off 

00:03:23.730 --> 00:03:28.410
 ok and now let's see the drasko that 

00:03:26.250 --> 00:03:30.510
 It's another good thing, because the Drac Scope is 

00:03:28.410 --> 00:03:32.519
 another thing another modality of the quiz cop 

00:03:30.510 --> 00:03:34.920
 what is different is the enemy 

00:03:32.519 --> 00:03:36.090
 when it is not stopped that all 

00:03:34.920 --> 00:03:39.239
 enemies in online are moving 

00:03:36.090 --> 00:03:40.800
 all the time as you know it is to aim 

00:03:39.239 --> 00:03:42.540
 to the side and move the valuable peephole 

00:03:40.800 --> 00:03:45.329
 point and move the peephole towards the 

00:03:42.540 --> 00:03:47.190
 enemy that serves for well how to be 

00:03:45.329 --> 00:03:49.290
 on the move have a greater greater 

00:03:47.190 --> 00:03:51.209
 hit on the enemy then when 

00:03:49.290 --> 00:03:55.350
 the enemy is in motion you take and 

00:03:51.209 --> 00:03:58.680
 he makes one and they strike him worth it would be 

00:03:55.350 --> 00:04:00.630
 well in fact prioritize that is to move the 

00:03:58.680 --> 00:04:02.040
 peep towards the enemy when he's in 

00:04:00.630 --> 00:04:03.540
 movement is worth all the enemies 

00:04:02.040 --> 00:04:05.370
 they are always in motion then they 

00:04:03.540 --> 00:04:07.440
 do that with help and work I'm going to 

00:04:05.370 --> 00:04:08.910
 make another example is worth it when it is like this 

00:04:07.440 --> 00:04:10.350
 it would be the same 

00:04:08.910 --> 00:04:12.690
 you take it from the side this is very good 

00:04:10.350 --> 00:04:15.090
 you move the villa towards the enemy 

00:04:12.690 --> 00:04:16.650
 from one side from the other side is 

00:04:15.090 --> 00:04:18.660
 towards the middle where this enemy is worth 

00:04:16.650 --> 00:04:20.489
 well it would be the drasko is one of those who 

00:04:18.660 --> 00:04:25.280
 more are used for the online mode and 

00:04:20.489 --> 00:04:25.280
 all the modes that are here 

00:04:29.190 --> 00:04:35.670
 when will bring the exhibition 

00:04:44.190 --> 00:04:47.889
 good as a personal opinion for 

00:04:46.300 --> 00:04:50.229
 finalize the video I'll tell you what 

00:04:47.889 --> 00:04:51.940
 I do to do the quick scouts and 

00:04:50.229 --> 00:04:54.280
 well you have a game down in what 

00:04:51.940 --> 00:04:55.810
 what I tell you all this so that if 

00:04:54.280 --> 00:04:57.699
 you want to see how I play a little bit with the 

00:04:55.810 --> 00:04:59.860
 sniper you have the game below 

00:04:57.699 --> 00:05:02.199
 and good in the most important thing that I 

00:04:59.860 --> 00:05:04.419
 I do the following whenever I stopped 

00:05:02.199 --> 00:05:07.389
 play the call of duty I get against 

00:05:04.419 --> 00:05:09.580
 bots in a private game and tried 

00:05:07.389 --> 00:05:11.349
 make me 23 games against bots for 

00:05:09.580 --> 00:05:13.660
 take the trick to the command the 

00:05:11.349 --> 00:05:15.849
 sensitivity of everything to thus have 

00:05:13.660 --> 00:05:17.530
 then in the online a precision 

00:05:15.849 --> 00:05:19.300
 awesome you catch a lot 

00:05:17.530 --> 00:05:22.570
 precision that's what I say to science 

00:05:19.300 --> 00:05:25.050
 true and good the following is something else 

00:05:22.570 --> 00:05:27.550
 what do I use that is when I left l1 

00:05:25.050 --> 00:05:29.169
 keep your breath ok I do not know if 

00:05:27.550 --> 00:05:32.259
 today is what holds your breath 

00:05:29.169 --> 00:05:34.330
 the good player because you are at l1 and at 

00:05:32.259 --> 00:05:36.340
 make the quiz hold your breath and 

00:05:34.330 --> 00:05:39.280
 there, the peephole remains 

00:05:36.340 --> 00:05:40.659
 would be this worth it would be to endure the 

00:05:39.280 --> 00:05:43.330
 breath when more with because 

00:05:40.659 --> 00:05:44.949
 there are many times that you can not stand it and 

00:05:43.330 --> 00:05:46.870
 they go the shots to the sides as you see 

00:05:44.949 --> 00:05:47.680
 here they do not go straight because that's better 

00:05:46.870 --> 00:05:50.289
 endure the 

00:05:47.680 --> 00:05:51.880
 and it goes right to the enemy and as you know no 

00:05:50.289 --> 00:05:53.680
 There is a crosshead as I say and it is more 

00:05:51.880 --> 00:05:55.539
 complicated so you have to have a 

00:05:53.680 --> 00:05:58.360
 notion more or less of the screen of 

00:05:55.539 --> 00:06:01.360
 where is the medium and where can you 

00:05:58.360 --> 00:06:05.979
 approach the shot more than anything and as you see 

00:06:01.360 --> 00:06:07.600
 the the gun point of the gun goes more 

00:06:05.979 --> 00:06:09.639
 or less when you fence them in the middle like this 

00:06:07.600 --> 00:06:12.070
 that you have an option that is to look at 

00:06:09.639 --> 00:06:14.830
 gun cannon and so have more more 

00:06:12.070 --> 00:06:17.620
 precision in this of the call of duty 

00:06:14.830 --> 00:06:19.389
 black or the call of duty cost forgiveness and 

00:06:17.620 --> 00:06:21.910
 nothing else those would be my opinions 

00:06:19.389 --> 00:06:22.990
 personal which is what I use and 

00:06:21.910 --> 00:06:25.539
 that would be I hope you liked it 

00:06:22.990 --> 00:06:27.520
 this video that supports it by removing a like 

00:06:25.539 --> 00:06:30.759
 favorites as I said you have below 

00:06:27.520 --> 00:06:32.710
 no link of the channel and the game that I have 

00:06:30.759 --> 00:06:34.599
 said before so you can see how I play 

00:06:32.710 --> 00:06:36.610
 more or less to the sniper and nothing else 

00:06:34.599 --> 00:06:40.590
 that would be everything so I say goodbye 

00:06:36.610 --> 00:06:40.590
 greeting and see you in the next goodbye
