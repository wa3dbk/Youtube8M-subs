desired temperature this is a gas and
electric<00:04:41.840> machine<00:04:42.260> with<00:04:42.590> infrared<00:04:43.070> panels<00:04:43.669> so

00:04:44.379 --> 00:04:44.389 
electric machine with infrared panels so

00:04:44.389 --> 00:04:47.320 
electric machine with infrared panels so
it<00:04:44.539> regulates<00:04:45.139> the<00:04:45.320> drum<00:04:45.770> which<00:04:46.580> rotates<00:04:47.060> in

00:04:47.320 --> 00:04:47.330 
it regulates the drum which rotates in

00:04:47.330 --> 00:04:49.750 
it regulates the drum which rotates in
here<00:04:47.660> I'll<00:04:48.260> drop<00:04:48.470> the<00:04:48.650> green<00:04:48.860> beans<00:04:49.190> in<00:04:49.580> and

here I'll drop the green beans in and

00:04:49.760 --> 00:04:53.680 
here I'll drop the green beans in and
it's<00:04:49.880> about<00:04:51.070> it<00:04:52.070> takes<00:04:52.370> as<00:04:52.729> long<00:04:53.120> as<00:04:53.360> 20

00:04:53.680 --> 00:04:53.690 
it's about it takes as long as 20

00:04:53.690 --> 00:04:56.980 
it's about it takes as long as 20
minutes<00:04:53.990> to<00:04:54.229> roast<00:04:54.410> a<00:04:54.650> desired<00:04:55.610> me<00:04:55.910> so<00:04:56.630> what<00:04:56.840> we
