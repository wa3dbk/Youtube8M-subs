are they doing this but now I'm like

00:03:36.949 --> 00:03:40.399 
are they doing this but now I'm like
this<00:03:37.949> could<00:03:38.190> probably<00:03:38.519> work<00:03:39.000> now<00:03:39.690> I<00:03:39.720> do<00:03:39.930> wish

00:03:40.399 --> 00:03:40.409 
this could probably work now I do wish

00:03:40.409 --> 00:03:42.170 
this could probably work now I do wish
that<00:03:40.440> they<00:03:40.799> did<00:03:41.040> at<00:03:41.190> a<00:03:41.220> character<00:03:41.699> in<00:03:41.849> some<00:03:42.030> kid

icarus<00:03:42.329> uprising<00:03:42.540> for<00:03:43.500> those<00:03:43.620> people<00:03:43.769> who

00:03:43.939 --> 00:03:43.949 
icarus uprising for those people who

00:03:43.949 --> 00:03:46.430 
icarus uprising for those people who
don't<00:03:44.220> know<00:03:44.340> his<00:03:44.579> name<00:03:44.730> is<00:03:44.940> Magnus<00:03:45.440> that

00:03:46.430 --> 00:03:46.440 
don't know his name is Magnus that

00:03:46.440 --> 00:03:49.039 
don't know his name is Magnus that
pretty<00:03:46.979> much<00:03:47.190> probably<00:03:47.579> could<00:03:48.090> play<00:03:48.389> as<00:03:48.720> Ike

00:03:49.039 --> 00:03:49.049 
pretty much probably could play as Ike

00:03:49.049 --> 00:03:51.289 
pretty much probably could play as Ike
in<00:03:49.379> the<00:03:50.099> next<00:03:50.340> match<00:03:50.459> with<00:03:50.729> game<00:03:50.909> it's<00:03:51.150> off

00:03:51.289 --> 00:03:51.299 
in the next match with game it's off

00:03:51.299 --> 00:03:52.879 
in the next match with game it's off
hard<00:03:51.540> this<00:03:51.720> size<00:03:51.930> can<00:03:52.169> add<00:03:52.349> another<00:03:52.650> get<00:03:52.859> a

00:03:52.879 --> 00:03:52.889 
hard this size can add another get a

00:03:52.889 --> 00:03:55.390 
hard this size can add another get a
grip<00:03:53.340> but<00:03:53.909> knowing<00:03:54.209> him<00:03:54.359> is<00:03:54.540> probably<00:03:54.840> palette

00:03:55.390 --> 00:03:55.400 
grip but knowing him is probably palette

00:03:55.400 --> 00:03:57.759 
grip but knowing him is probably palette
which<00:03:56.390> I<00:03:56.629> could<00:03:56.840> make<00:03:56.989> so<00:03:57.110> much<00:03:57.260> sense<00:03:57.290> by<00:03:57.709> the

00:03:57.759 --> 00:03:57.769 
which I could make so much sense by the

00:03:57.769 --> 00:04:01.360 
which I could make so much sense by the
way<00:03:57.980> but<00:03:58.489> that's<00:03:59.239> besides<00:03:59.689> the<00:03:59.780> point<00:04:00.370> talking

00:04:01.360 --> 00:04:01.370 
way but that's besides the point talking

00:04:01.370 --> 00:04:04.270 
way but that's besides the point talking
about<00:04:01.610> Ike<00:04:01.760> right<00:04:02.030> now<00:04:02.209> Mike<00:04:03.110> looks<00:04:03.739> so
