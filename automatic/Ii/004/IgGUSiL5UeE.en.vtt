00:00:07.751 --> 00:00:15.100
Centuries ago four prison ships from Earth veered off course and journeyed deep into the remote Koprulu Sector.

00:00:15.100 --> 00:00:24.508
There they crash-landed on the planets of Tarsonis, Moria, and Umoja.

00:00:24.508 --> 00:00:35.649
Cut off from Earth, the survivors established colonies throughout the sector.

00:00:35.649 --> 00:00:42.949
The largest, Tarsonis, was founded by a powerful yet increasingly oppressive government called the Confederacy.

00:00:42.949 --> 00:00:51.365
Spurred by the terrible acts of this government, Arcturus Mengsk formed the Sons of Korhal.

00:00:51.365 --> 00:00:57.053
This rebel army fought to overthrow the Confederacy and liberate the Koprulu Sector.

00:00:57.053 --> 00:01:05.234
Even as Mengsk and his resistance fighters fought to overthrow the corrupt Confederacy, a much greater threat confronted the Terrans.

00:01:05.234 --> 00:01:12.916
Without warning, massive alien warships appeared and surrounded the Confederate planet of Chau Sara.

00:01:12.916 --> 00:01:23.719
Calling themselves the Protoss, the aliens incinerated the planet’s surface and then mysteriously withdrew.

00:01:23.719 --> 00:01:31.203
The planet had been infested by another type of alien: the Zerg.

00:01:31.203 --> 00:01:40.164
These monstrous creatures threatened to overwhelm Terran space, and the Protoss sought to eradicate them before they spread.

00:01:40.164 --> 00:01:53.357
The Zerg had already reached the neighboring planet, Mara Sara, and Marshal Jim Raynor fought to save the terrified colonists as the Confederate government abandoned them to the alien menace.

00:01:53.357 --> 00:02:03.085
The Sons of Korhal intervened, saving thousands of lives from the rampaging Zerg and enigmatic Protoss.

00:02:03.085 --> 00:02:12.765
Disgusted by the Confederacy, Raynor joined the rebels and met Sarah Kerrigan.

00:02:12.765 --> 00:02:23.188
Kerrigan was a former Confederate Ghost operative, and she shared Raynor’s desire for a liberated Koprulu Sector.

00:02:23.188 --> 00:02:29.340
They grew close as the battle with the Confederacy escalated.

00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:36.575
But Mengsk went too far in his hatred and ambition.

00:02:36.575 --> 00:02:45.702
He ordered devices placed on the Confederate capital world of Tarsonis to lure the Zerg and annihilate the population.

00:02:45.702 --> 00:02:57.120
The Protoss, led by Executor Tassadar, decided to help the Terrans defeat the Zerg instead of purging the planet of life.

00:02:57.120 --> 00:03:02.390
Mengsk sent Kerrigan to stop Tassadar’s interference.

00:03:02.390 --> 00:03:09.294
With Kerrigan battling the Protoss, the Zerg overwhelmed Tarsonis and decimated the population.

00:03:09.294 --> 00:03:17.705
Having achieved his goals, Mengsk left the planet and abandoned Kerrigan to the aliens.

00:03:17.705 --> 00:03:21.831
Sickened by Mengsk’s treachery, Raynor quit the Sons of Korhal.

00:03:21.831 --> 00:03:29.563
He raced to the planet’s surface to save Kerrigan, but was too late: No trace of her remained.
