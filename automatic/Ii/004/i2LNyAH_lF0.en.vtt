00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:01.060
 Hello 

00:00:01.060 --> 00:00:03.009
 with you again romanchenko anton and 

00:00:03.009 --> 00:00:06.390
 how to learn perm 15 kilometers rate 1 

00:00:06.390 --> 00:00:09.629
 I train one section of the track 

00:00:09.629 --> 00:00:10.789
 Today 

00:00:10.789 --> 00:00:13.079
 i talked cold is important enough for 

00:00:13.079 --> 00:00:15.569
 beginners 5 thousand especially five girls 

00:00:15.569 --> 00:00:16.619
 business 

00:00:16.619 --> 00:00:18.070
 like on the way 

00:00:18.070 --> 00:00:20.210
 with the help of ancestors 

00:00:20.210 --> 00:00:22.000
 there are two parameters that we are with 

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:23.650
 we can nicely 

00:00:23.650 --> 00:00:25.089
 during custody 

00:00:25.089 --> 00:00:26.569
 long baking 

00:00:26.569 --> 00:00:27.929
 light intensity 

00:00:27.929 --> 00:00:29.710
 accordingly the questions that we 

00:00:29.710 --> 00:00:31.210
 must take away 

00:00:31.210 --> 00:00:33.379
 what should be the duration and 

00:00:33.379 --> 00:00:35.320
 deacon intensity to induce 

00:00:35.320 --> 00:00:37.290
 using him 

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:39.310
 let's turn biochemistry physics 

00:00:39.310 --> 00:00:40.280
 namely 

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:43.140
 energy production mechanism in art children 

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:45.510
 fall mechanism is a crossroads 

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:46.079
 reader 

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:48.000
 using molecules translation 

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:50.930
 correspondence with sulfur molecules 

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:53.060
 peripheral mechanism is fast 

00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:55.290
 mechanism it turns on at first 

00:00:55.290 --> 00:00:57.370
 Yak minutes and three third rescue 

00:00:57.370 --> 00:01:00.370
 now living creatures for this deputy 

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:03.540
 at the same time the costs of this molecule ruble year 

00:01:03.540 --> 00:01:05.430
 being in our muscles 

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:07.490
 and in our songs 

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:09.759
 lipid mechanisms slower he 

00:01:09.759 --> 00:01:11.200
 turns on 

00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:12.980
 some time after the start 

00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:15.880
 physical activity when it is already and costs 

00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:17.290
 dream which number of molecules 

00:01:17.290 --> 00:01:19.700
 public of the year 

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:22.149
 and it turns on 3 i these 

00:01:22.149 --> 00:01:23.539
 speed average 

00:01:23.539 --> 00:01:25.940
 and if 

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:28.070
 the exhibition is spent first 

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:29.220
 kindergartens 

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:32.030
 the person is in our thoughts 

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:34.450
 and then fats are consumed 

00:01:34.450 --> 00:01:37.130
 located above our hypodermic tissue 

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:38.760
 in other words 

00:01:38.760 --> 00:01:39.729
 this 

00:01:39.729 --> 00:01:41.090
 here are those places 

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:44.090
 which we need 

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:48.570
 what will be from all of the above 

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:50.960
 the fact that he is for weight loss I have to 

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:53.240
 be long enough 

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:54.900
 not less 

00:01:54.900 --> 00:01:56.810
 37 5 kopecks 

00:01:56.810 --> 00:01:59.750
 up and repeat i must be not by rank 

00:01:59.750 --> 00:02:00.640
 fast 

00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:02.930
 with moderate speed then the most 

00:02:02.930 --> 00:02:05.340
 effectively expected 

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:07.750
 your cheeses 

00:02:07.750 --> 00:02:10.459
 up so sure with a corr 

00:02:10.459 --> 00:02:12.510
 this is about that speed gave it 

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:15.219
 write the percentage of the muscles do not seem to get tired 

00:02:15.219 --> 00:02:15.920
 still 

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:18.530
 breathing is normal but that is what it is today 

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:20.860
 increase your speed and dyspnea will begin and 

00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:24.560
 however its holding water is fast for 

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:27.069
 whole body poor 

00:02:27.069 --> 00:02:29.489
 another sign this market is sport 

00:02:29.489 --> 00:02:30.659
 is Putin 

00:02:30.659 --> 00:02:33.639
 in the region of 150 deputies a minute 

00:02:33.639 --> 00:02:35.709
 with this track poland 

00:02:35.709 --> 00:02:38.709
 at the same time purity of heart rate 

00:02:40.299 --> 00:02:42.719
 tenge this is considered moderate 

00:02:42.719 --> 00:02:45.079
 so choose your drunk and your 

00:02:45.079 --> 00:02:47.419
 long lasting 

00:02:47.419 --> 00:02:49.889
 but it must be at least thirty minutes 

00:02:49.889 --> 00:02:52.889
 reside other dollars 5 

00:02:53.769 --> 00:02:55.559
 becker road 

00:02:55.559 --> 00:02:57.849
 5th anniversary for the beauty of your body 

00:02:57.849 --> 00:02:59.429
 and all will be well 

00:02:59.429 --> 00:03:00.639
 bavaria was romanchenko 

00:03:00.639 --> 00:03:02.979
 Tarkovsky how to learn 9 15 

00:03:02.979 --> 00:03:05.359
 kilometers in one month I train on 

00:03:05.359 --> 00:03:07.439
 under the roof especially ways 

00:03:07.439 --> 00:03:09.329
 be on was a public page 

00:03:09.329 --> 00:03:12.650
