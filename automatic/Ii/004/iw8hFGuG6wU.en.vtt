 who liked the fact of the fact or who found 

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:28.560

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:32.600
 Thank you very much indeed, thank you. 

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:35.970
 for your feedback and we got to the end né 

00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:38.580
 if you watched since the first video 

00:00:35.970 --> 00:00:41.700
 knows that he had missions there that 

00:00:38.580 --> 00:00:43.710
 resurrected missions that preceded 

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:46.590
 even the missions that 

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:48.840
 rescued some friends of jackson in the 

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:52.020
 if I am not redeeming here 

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:55.260
 friend and yes the brother of the fast 

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:58.920
 highly and as it would be a very 

00:00:55.260 --> 00:01:01.680
 long is to get to that point where 

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:05.189
 I 'm here I'd have to go through 

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:07.500
 some other parts of the mission until 

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:10.549
 even there a confrontation a head-to-head 

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:14.670
 with roy tiné ​​who is the final boss 

00:01:10.549 --> 00:01:17.310
 together with the Basque rock was another 

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:20.249
 also the game's villain and we would have 

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:23.070
 human to human with it after a game 

00:01:20.249 --> 00:01:25.049
 of poker but how great would it be 

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:28.380
 Mission I already bring you here for 

00:01:25.049 --> 00:01:28.859
 airport that is where the high 

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:30.810
 line 

00:01:28.859 --> 00:01:33.119
 a detail of this video I'm not 

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:36.270
 making comments live I've had 

00:01:33.119 --> 00:01:38.069
 and a problem with my network 7 draws only 

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:41.909
 What am I going to do here? 

00:01:38.069 --> 00:01:43.530
 I almost ended up killing myself the rpg him but 

00:01:41.909 --> 00:01:45.509
 worked because I ended up killing the 

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:49.350
 face with flamethrower, right? 

00:01:45.509 --> 00:01:51.329
 but beauty that already is the shed where 

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:56.009
 Find the ray he's in that door. 

00:01:51.329 --> 00:01:57.149
 here and we will open here beauty then I 

00:01:56.009 --> 00:01:59.009
 I was telling you that this 

00:01:57.149 --> 00:02:01.380
 comment that he was not live is 

00:01:59.009 --> 00:02:03.990
 sorry unfortunately i had a 

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:07.049
 problem with my set networks and there i 

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:10.860
 I had to end up buying the other one. 

00:02:07.049 --> 00:02:12.630
 headset and how I wanted to do it already 

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:13.960
 had captured né 

00:02:12.630 --> 00:02:17.200
 I wanted to finish this series. 

00:02:13.960 --> 00:02:19.060
 soon because I have other games there to 

00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:21.850
 do too so I wanted to finish 

00:02:19.060 --> 00:02:23.890
 so I already captured the image I left 

00:02:21.850 --> 00:02:25.270
 to make the comments on top is with 

00:02:23.890 --> 00:02:27.580
 catchers here already ordered to make a 

00:02:25.270 --> 00:02:30.880
 I mess up there and that's what I bet you 

00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:32.530
 Ray rescues you can not leave there 

00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:34.720
 ago it was how I did I stayed 

00:02:32.530 --> 00:02:36.310
 doing his coverage there and now the 

00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:38.320
 people take the helicopter there we go 

00:02:36.310 --> 00:02:42.640
 destroy everything now let's destroy everything 

00:02:38.320 --> 00:02:46.390
 and the rescue missions of the 

00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:49.090
 friends of jason rescue né were 

00:02:46.390 --> 00:02:52.330
 more or less similar and the rescue of the 

00:02:49.090 --> 00:02:55.030
 hi lo and it is also always we ride in 

00:02:52.330 --> 00:03:01.390
 some vehicle in the case here is a 

00:02:55.030 --> 00:03:03.340
 aircraft and the helicopter but the missions 

00:03:01.390 --> 00:03:06.040
 they are very similar mechanics 

00:03:03.340 --> 00:03:08.830
 the missions are just like you in the 

00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:12.520
 We had the jeep right. 

00:03:08.830 --> 00:03:15.130
 already in oliver's mission we had a 

00:03:12.520 --> 00:03:17.170
 boat is and here in the mission of the ray the people 

00:03:15.130 --> 00:03:19.750
 There's the helicopter here. 

00:03:17.170 --> 00:03:22.060
 controlling the machine gun and let's do 

00:03:19.750 --> 00:03:24.970
 A watering this is a very difficult part. 

00:03:22.060 --> 00:03:27.340
 I'll be honest with you, I'm done. 

00:03:24.970 --> 00:03:29.560
 playing was a three times is not because 

00:03:27.340 --> 00:03:31.870
 I let you have it already. 

00:03:29.560 --> 00:03:33.010
 noting to relieve the energy bar of the 

00:03:31.870 --> 00:03:34.780
 helicopter, right? 

00:03:33.010 --> 00:03:38.050
 I find it unnecessary to have these 

00:03:34.780 --> 00:03:40.000
 bars beauty investigations and has many 

00:03:38.050 --> 00:03:42.520
 caresses here with rpg also that 

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:44.770
 get in the way and if you get a 

00:03:42.520 --> 00:03:47.470
 bit off certainly the guys will 

00:03:44.770 --> 00:03:50.770
 you with a rpg and will cause 

00:03:47.470 --> 00:03:52.480
 enough damage and here is the one that went 

00:03:50.770 --> 00:03:55.690
 The third time that I'm not mistaken is that 

00:03:52.480 --> 00:03:58.270
 capturing and playing this song 

00:03:55.690 --> 00:03:59.830
 Funny, I will not be able to leave it there. 

00:03:58.270 --> 00:04:01.990
 obviously because otherwise I'll take 

00:03:59.830 --> 00:04:04.620
 some notification here from youtube that 

00:04:01.990 --> 00:04:06.910
 It's not the intention this is not mine. 

00:04:04.620 --> 00:04:08.440
 Real interest already comes the caresses 

00:04:06.910 --> 00:04:10.120
 shooting with rpg 

00:04:08.440 --> 00:04:11.770
 I think I hesitated a little bit. 

00:04:10.120 --> 00:04:13.980
 only here but like the guys too 

00:04:11.770 --> 00:04:17.850
 are passing underneath with 

00:04:13.980 --> 00:04:19.680
 with cars and boats I just took and the 

00:04:17.850 --> 00:04:21.209
 The screen turns a little red right. 

00:04:19.680 --> 00:04:23.580
 You have to take special care. 

00:04:21.209 --> 00:04:25.800
 here but this part that went well 

00:04:23.580 --> 00:04:28.889
 interesting because the music she 

00:04:25.800 --> 00:04:31.500
 contributed greatly to the destruction and 

00:04:28.889 --> 00:04:34.380
 no far cry, it's too cool for you to destroy 

00:04:31.500 --> 00:04:36.720
 It's me, I especially liked the 

00:04:34.380 --> 00:04:38.310
 far cry destruction gets excited 

00:04:36.720 --> 00:04:40.910
 so especially when you handle 

00:04:38.310 --> 00:04:44.580
 a weapon mounted in the case of the helicopter 

00:04:40.910 --> 00:04:46.590
 It's really cool to walk though the scale 

00:04:44.580 --> 00:04:48.630
 enough has that bar 

00:04:46.590 --> 00:04:52.139
 overheating there too but it's okay 

00:04:48.630 --> 00:04:54.389
 cool to use I faltered because there in the 

00:04:52.139 --> 00:04:59.690
 skills we could put 

00:04:54.389 --> 00:05:02.580
 a skill there would reduce it is oo 

00:04:59.690 --> 00:05:05.430
 overheating then you 

00:05:02.580 --> 00:05:07.860
 I could take it a lot more but I just 

00:05:05.430 --> 00:05:10.530
 forgetting that I was already well at 

00:05:07.860 --> 00:05:13.199
 Game end even wanting terminal 

00:05:10.530 --> 00:05:14.370
 Not that I did not like 

00:05:13.199 --> 00:05:17.639
 do but like I said earlier 

00:05:14.370 --> 00:05:20.849
 for you I have other games to there 

00:05:17.639 --> 00:05:24.330
 do have a personal asking there are games 

00:05:20.849 --> 00:05:26.190
 new ones too and I trying to attend there in 

00:05:24.330 --> 00:05:28.560
 As far as possible I wanted to finish 

00:05:26.190 --> 00:05:30.060
 because it's been a week since I 

00:05:28.560 --> 00:05:31.830
 do not record a video for the channel 

00:05:30.060 --> 00:05:34.889
 I said I 'm going to finish here with the far 

00:05:31.830 --> 00:05:37.889
 cry 3 is with the last video there I would not even go 

00:05:34.889 --> 00:05:40.380
 bring this from here by redeeming ray but I 

00:05:37.889 --> 00:05:43.229
 I found the mission very good so it's there I 

00:05:40.380 --> 00:05:45.570
 I hope you are enjoying it okay 

00:05:43.229 --> 00:05:48.870
 reaching the end 

00:05:45.570 --> 00:05:51.389
 only connect had a rpg face 

00:05:48.870 --> 00:05:53.849
 down there the second time in the first and 

00:05:51.389 --> 00:05:55.289
 The second time I ended up losing the mission. 

00:05:53.849 --> 00:05:57.840
 because of him he is there in that 

00:05:55.289 --> 00:06:00.599
 tree but I killed him now but he pulls 

00:05:57.840 --> 00:06:03.930
 only connect the power cord of the 

00:06:00.599 --> 00:06:05.310
 helicopter is the past a shit is 

00:06:03.930 --> 00:06:08.700
 because now three helicopters will come 

00:06:05.310 --> 00:06:11.430
 and funny that the game gave a 

00:06:08.700 --> 00:06:13.410
 cooperated for me there because the only 

00:06:11.430 --> 00:06:16.770
 helicopter that shot me is this 

00:06:13.410 --> 00:06:19.680
 of the yoki that just fell on him did not 

00:06:16.770 --> 00:06:21.150
 fell down will not fall now is and was the only 

00:06:19.680 --> 00:06:23.550
 helicopter that shot me at the time 

00:06:21.150 --> 00:06:27.000
 who fell without actually falling another 

00:06:23.550 --> 00:06:30.900
 now and what 's left over there 

00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:32.910
 4 white it very hard to fall I do not know 

00:06:30.900 --> 00:06:35.340
 What happened to the two others who 

00:06:32.910 --> 00:06:37.350
 They threw me fell so easy this 

00:06:35.340 --> 00:06:40.170
 Then you do not do anything. 

00:06:37.350 --> 00:06:42.420
 He did not even shoot me, it took a lot. 

00:06:40.170 --> 00:06:45.300
 to fall but that's it now he went to 

00:06:42.420 --> 00:06:46.830
 ditch and taf is coming to the end of 

00:06:45.300 --> 00:06:49.020
 video there I hope you have 

00:06:46.830 --> 00:06:50.760
 liked and that's it now I count on 

00:06:49.020 --> 00:06:53.280
 you there in the evaluation of this video if 

00:06:50.760 --> 00:06:56.280
 Did you like your favorite like your favorite? 

00:06:53.280 --> 00:06:58.470
 and we see each other in another video 

00:06:56.280 --> 00:07:00.900
 now of far cry 3 because the clasp is 

00:06:58.470 --> 00:07:04.520
 series there but we see each other 

00:07:00.900 --> 00:07:04.520
 videos there because I went
