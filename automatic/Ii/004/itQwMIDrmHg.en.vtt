00:00:06.130 --> 00:00:12.730
 there is where it started in the normal rate 

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:14.440
 also not be limited to people who are 

00:00:12.730 --> 00:00:16.660
 in the debut program so with a 

00:00:14.440 --> 00:00:19.240
 little anxiety to make the goal 

00:00:16.660 --> 00:00:21.689
 the victory and now I do on Sunday in 

00:00:19.240 --> 00:00:24.250
 São Paulo is being excellent difficult 

00:00:21.689 --> 00:00:27.070
 to understand, for example, that he delivered 

00:00:24.250 --> 00:00:30.369
 a player who was unknown in a 

00:00:27.070 --> 00:00:34.899
 national level so it gets there it was good 

00:00:30.369 --> 00:00:38.110
 service I'm going to make beautiful matches is 

00:00:34.899 --> 00:00:40.300
 that another agent of the highest level but 

00:00:38.110 --> 00:00:42.310
 most of the time i believe in movie 

00:00:40.300 --> 00:00:45.220
 also usually give a lot of work and 

00:00:42.310 --> 00:00:46.690
 you spoke to motions setbacks right goals 

00:00:45.220 --> 00:00:49.870
 it matters 

00:00:46.690 --> 00:00:51.940
 I hope to help a lot of money robbed 

00:00:49.870 --> 00:00:54.040
 everybody arrived 

00:00:51.940 --> 00:00:56.590
 Since we arrived, people say that the 

00:00:54.040 --> 00:00:58.930
 group such're very strong is not 

00:00:56.590 --> 00:01:00.880
 forming the fantasy that everyone is 

00:00:58.930 --> 00:01:02.920
 wanting titles everyone thinking 

00:01:00.880 --> 00:01:04.390
 so I think it does not leave us 

00:01:02.920 --> 00:01:07.450
 these two of peace is football thing 

00:01:04.390 --> 00:01:09.640
 same happens in the second already fight not 

00:01:07.450 --> 00:01:11.530
 It was here and every game we were going 

00:01:09.640 --> 00:01:13.270
 on top of the guys that I'm sure 

00:01:11.530 --> 00:01:15.939
 that results still listen to our team 

00:01:13.270 --> 00:01:18.999
 have confidence even then to agree 

00:01:15.939 --> 00:01:20.530
 basis of this adaptation phase because 

00:01:18.999 --> 00:01:22.420
 São Paulo title when we started 

00:01:20.530 --> 00:01:24.729
 we also won the first one already 

00:01:22.420 --> 00:01:26.740
 lost two in a row has not yet started 

00:01:24.729 --> 00:01:28.749
 distrust the people there also still 

00:01:26.740 --> 00:01:30.939
 take care of the second defeat, we were the 

00:01:28.749 --> 00:01:32.469
 engine has started to grow as the 

00:01:30.939 --> 00:01:34.509
 our favor 

00:01:32.469 --> 00:01:36.549
 the Brazilian also has this because the 

00:01:34.509 --> 00:01:41.049
 the championship is different the board took 

00:01:36.549 --> 00:01:43.569
 the level is completely different but 

00:01:41.049 --> 00:01:45.609
 I do not know if they have this adaptation. 

00:01:43.569 --> 00:01:47.139
 be adjusted in the course of matches in 

00:01:45.609 --> 00:01:49.719
 year championship account 

00:01:47.139 --> 00:01:51.369
 so for us it is important because type 

00:01:49.719 --> 00:01:52.490
 I could not keep up with all the work. 

00:01:51.369 --> 00:01:54.470
 professional 

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:57.079
 the goal but surely have already passed through 

00:01:54.470 --> 00:01:59.869
 many situations of all the links 

00:01:57.079 --> 00:02:01.850
 of good situations with common bonds in 

00:01:59.869 --> 00:02:04.490
 bad situations he knows the profile of 

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:07.610
 each as canon react due 

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:10.220
 I think I have to know the 

00:02:07.610 --> 00:02:12.200
 players get easier it knows that 

00:02:10.220 --> 00:02:14.300
 this moment the pressure if it is thing 

00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:16.700
 squeeze and can not handle 

00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:19.660
 I think this helps a lot and 

00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:22.580
 differences he does not lack 

00:02:19.660 --> 00:02:25.010
 May experience has a footprint 

00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:30.290
 Otherwise I will not open a berg machine 

00:02:25.010 --> 00:02:32.120
 but it is is different he is catching client 

00:02:30.290 --> 00:02:36.739
 now we really need it for us now 

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:38.510
 is to help but 

00:02:36.739 --> 00:02:42.680
 know that he stayed out of these three 

00:02:38.510 --> 00:02:46.220
 now because he had the flu guy who 

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:49.370
 likes to stay 4 20 year on the day of 

00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:50.269
 I even play thesee hotel author on 

00:02:49.370 --> 00:02:54.799
 Hill 

00:02:50.269 --> 00:02:57.079
 It's really makeup, but it can happen. 

00:02:54.799 --> 00:03:00.320
 a little later neither he nor he 

00:02:57.079 --> 00:03:02.959
 the andrey the kelvin they felt yesterday 

00:03:00.320 --> 00:03:04.910
 the day before yesterday they came feeling there I 

00:03:02.959 --> 00:03:06.769
 I wanted it after two but it will come back 

00:03:04.910 --> 00:03:10.609
 but today there are already many people already 

00:03:06.769 --> 00:03:12.650
 We're going to know what 's important. 

00:03:10.609 --> 00:03:16.579
 too much ours too much 

00:03:12.650 --> 00:03:20.630
 I did not come here and I'm eating here 

00:03:16.579 --> 00:03:24.579
 with too much truth I live for 23 

00:03:20.630 --> 00:03:29.930
 days domain be so because our 

00:03:24.579 --> 00:03:32.590
 Look I want a nervous day, yes. But 

00:03:29.930 --> 00:03:32.590
 joking right? 

00:03:32.700 --> 00:03:42.870
 the country imports each is so much good 

00:03:40.800 --> 00:03:45.959
 I get very nervous when I'm 

00:03:42.870 --> 00:03:49.019
 It's okay when it's dawn with scissors. 

00:03:45.959 --> 00:03:51.750
 final defeat as soon as it touches the 

00:03:49.019 --> 00:03:57.930
 People, but I gave up much after the week. 

00:03:51.750 --> 00:03:59.310
 just leaving can stay after then me 

00:03:57.930 --> 00:04:01.500
 I think that today and tomorrow we will 

00:03:59.310 --> 00:04:03.660
 accept the videos because it was 

00:04:01.500 --> 00:04:06.150
 the videos make you see the points 

00:04:03.660 --> 00:04:08.000
 them to start studying and 

00:04:06.150 --> 00:04:11.010
 Do you know who knows anything? 

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:13.980
 neutralize conca from there in 

00:04:11.010 --> 00:04:15.810
 yesterday I see this boy in these 

00:04:13.980 --> 00:04:18.930
 rounds is not good, right? 

00:04:15.810 --> 00:04:20.760
 bruno then player who makes two goals 

00:04:18.930 --> 00:04:23.190
 before you sure have to take a lot 

00:04:20.760 --> 00:04:24.830
 be careful with them and we'll study the 

00:04:23.190 --> 00:04:28.169
 team yet and I'm sure 

00:04:24.830 --> 00:04:30.060
 Let's work on power and not 

00:04:28.169 --> 00:04:32.490
 already lacked the strongest of Brazil one of the 

00:04:30.060 --> 00:04:34.139
 central points of our giant has 

00:04:32.490 --> 00:04:38.220
 This is drowning us. 

00:04:34.139 --> 00:04:40.860
 so then here in training do not know 

00:04:38.220 --> 00:04:43.410
 We also talk at home 

00:04:40.860 --> 00:04:45.570
 focus even direct talk between people 

00:04:43.410 --> 00:04:47.729
 have to earn that pressure is up 

00:04:45.570 --> 00:04:50.070
 We're getting people from us. 

00:04:47.729 --> 00:04:52.229
 balance things there with 

00:04:50.070 --> 00:04:56.729
 Tranquility She 'll Come Say The Card 

00:04:52.229 --> 00:04:59.190
 Direct was too much 

00:04:56.729 --> 00:05:00.930
 I left here in Brazil as an entrepreneur 

00:04:59.190 --> 00:05:02.010
 have a snack and we usually do 

00:05:00.930 --> 00:05:03.960
 18 years 

00:05:02.010 --> 00:05:05.910
 During the week we catch a day. 

00:05:03.960 --> 00:05:13.590
 after taking place the catch up and 

00:05:05.910 --> 00:05:15.510
 also save 

00:05:13.590 --> 00:05:17.610
 then they scored me my wife 

00:05:15.510 --> 00:05:21.690
 winding up of energy in each 

00:05:17.610 --> 00:05:24.720
 surprise of the paraná 

00:05:21.690 --> 00:05:27.270
 the father to the mother years my brother's relative 

00:05:24.720 --> 00:05:30.289
 that was all there in the parana 

00:05:27.270 --> 00:05:41.849
 Yesterday even today's favor 

00:05:30.289 --> 00:05:43.140
 opinion although our group is now 

00:05:41.849 --> 00:05:48.030
 very strong 

00:05:43.140 --> 00:05:51.659
 every player wants this but it's okay 

00:05:48.030 --> 00:05:54.000
 coming in any situation is fine 

00:05:51.659 --> 00:05:55.950
 best when in a position of 

00:05:54.000 --> 00:06:00.810
 players coming and going very far 

00:05:55.950 --> 00:06:04.890
 in this championship well yes one of the things 

00:06:00.810 --> 00:06:07.590
 to which I come here is another level of play and 

00:06:04.890 --> 00:06:10.860
 It's like big team has to know how to play. 

00:06:07.590 --> 00:06:12.240
 Can not stay just help as I said 

00:06:10.860 --> 00:06:14.430
 in my speech to mass in my 

00:06:12.240 --> 00:06:16.979
 presentation is on the left side of the 

00:06:14.430 --> 00:06:19.169
 calico on the 11th of nadal 

00:06:16.979 --> 00:06:20.909
 This is good too at a certain point, but 

00:06:19.169 --> 00:06:23.099
 have the same have to play and so 

00:06:20.909 --> 00:06:25.500
 is buying enough of the results 

00:06:23.099 --> 00:06:27.870
 is asking who goes out to play when 

00:06:25.500 --> 00:06:29.460
 because you have to touch the ball too. 

00:06:27.870 --> 00:06:32.280
 keep possession of the ball with us 

00:06:29.460 --> 00:06:34.500
 because they are bought joseph happens 

00:06:32.280 --> 00:06:38.780
 people keep singing to them they 

00:06:34.500 --> 00:06:38.780
 Colmata, people have to deal with matter.
