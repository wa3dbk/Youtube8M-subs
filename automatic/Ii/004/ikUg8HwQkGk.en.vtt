here<00:01:43.649> and<00:01:43.860> of<00:01:44.520> course<00:01:44.759> he<00:01:45.659> knows<00:01:45.990> the<00:01:46.470> reaction

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:46.950 
here and of course he knows the reaction

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:48.050 
here and of course he knows the reaction
that<00:01:47.100> he<00:01:47.310> will<00:01:47.460> have<00:01:47.610> from<00:01:47.790> the<00:01:47.909> Muslim

00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:48.060 
that he will have from the Muslim

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:52.280 
that he will have from the Muslim
humanity<00:01:48.659> by<00:01:49.470> making<00:01:50.130> the<00:01:50.549> soundings<00:01:51.119> and<00:01:51.290> it

humanity by making the soundings and it
is<00:01:52.439> very<00:01:52.649> sad<00:01:52.950> I<00:01:53.340> mean<00:01:53.579> you<00:01:54.119> know<00:01:54.299> we<00:01:55.020> believe

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:55.350 
is very sad I mean you know we believe

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:56.959 
is very sad I mean you know we believe
and<00:01:55.619> I<00:01:55.770> think<00:01:55.979> all<00:01:56.159> the<00:01:56.490> world<00:01:56.820> religions

00:01:56.959 --> 00:01:56.969 
and I think all the world religions

00:01:56.969 --> 00:01:59.600 
and I think all the world religions
believe<00:01:57.390> that<00:01:58.290> everyone<00:01:58.740> scriptures<00:01:59.490> are

00:01:59.600 --> 00:01:59.610 
believe that everyone scriptures are

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:05.289 
believe that everyone scriptures are
sacred<00:01:59.850> and<00:02:00.320> to<00:02:01.320> burn<00:02:02.030> his<00:02:03.030> sacred<00:02:03.899> scriptures

00:02:05.289 --> 00:02:05.299 
sacred and to burn his sacred scriptures

00:02:05.299 --> 00:02:10.639 
sacred and to burn his sacred scriptures
even<00:02:06.299> by<00:02:06.509> his<00:02:06.659> own<00:02:07.099> faith<00:02:08.209> is<00:02:09.349> incorrect<00:02:10.349> and

00:02:10.639 --> 00:02:10.649 
even by his own faith is incorrect and

00:02:10.649 --> 00:02:13.400 
even by his own faith is incorrect and
therefore<00:02:11.580> we're<00:02:11.879> not<00:02:12.000> quite<00:02:12.270> sure

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:13.410 
therefore we're not quite sure

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:15.950 
therefore we're not quite sure
it's<00:02:13.680> not<00:02:13.890> a<00:02:13.950> religious<00:02:14.460> thing<00:02:14.490> he<00:02:15.180> just<00:02:15.690> was

00:02:15.950 --> 00:02:15.960 
it's not a religious thing he just was

00:02:15.960 --> 00:02:18.800 
it's not a religious thing he just was
trying<00:02:16.140> to<00:02:16.350> create<00:02:16.560> a<00:02:16.650> media<00:02:16.860> circus<00:02:17.250> and<00:02:17.810> this

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:18.810 
trying to create a media circus and this

that<00:03:21.860> instead<00:03:22.860> of<00:03:22.920> dividing<00:03:23.670> people<00:03:24.120> pastor

00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:24.690 
that instead of dividing people pastor

00:03:24.690 --> 00:03:25.850 
that instead of dividing people pastor
Jones's<00:03:25.020> actually<00:03:25.290> may<00:03:25.350> actually<00:03:25.500> bring

the United States and we are very

00:03:51.600 --> 00:03:53.180 
the United States and we are very
hopeful<00:03:52.200> that<00:03:52.260> this<00:03:52.620> is<00:03:52.800> bringing
