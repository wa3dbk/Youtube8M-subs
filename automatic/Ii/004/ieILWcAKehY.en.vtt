editors<00:00:27.599> with<00:00:28.079> it<00:00:28.230> and<00:00:29.390> decided<00:00:30.390> to<00:00:30.419> do<00:00:31.200> a

00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:31.230 
editors with it and decided to do a

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:34.510 
editors with it and decided to do a
quick<00:00:31.500> video<00:00:31.829> showing<00:00:32.270> how<00:00:33.270> it<00:00:33.420> sounds<00:00:33.840> and

00:00:34.510 --> 00:00:34.520 
quick video showing how it sounds and

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:37.910 
quick video showing how it sounds and
guess<00:00:35.520> a<00:00:35.550> quick<00:00:35.880> review<00:00:36.270> on<00:00:36.590> what<00:00:37.590> it<00:00:37.680> took<00:00:37.860> to

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:37.920 
guess a quick review on what it took to

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:41.330 
guess a quick review on what it took to
install<00:00:38.730> it<00:00:39.859> installation<00:00:40.859> was<00:00:41.010> pretty

00:00:41.330 --> 00:00:41.340 
install it installation was pretty

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:45.410 
install it installation was pretty
straightforward<00:00:43.940> basically<00:00:44.940> the<00:00:45.090> hardest

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:45.420 
straightforward basically the hardest

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:47.750 
straightforward basically the hardest
part<00:00:45.660> was<00:00:45.719> just<00:00:46.170> removing<00:00:46.890> the<00:00:47.070> fairings<00:00:47.489> and

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:47.760 
part was just removing the fairings and

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:50.119 
part was just removing the fairings and
getting<00:00:48.420> the<00:00:48.510> old<00:00:48.660> exhaust<00:00:49.019> off<00:00:49.350> and<00:00:49.710> then

00:00:50.119 --> 00:00:50.129 
getting the old exhaust off and then

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:52.509 
getting the old exhaust off and then
after<00:00:50.550> that<00:00:50.640> it<00:00:50.879> was<00:00:51.000> pretty<00:00:51.269> much<00:00:51.629> just

00:00:52.509 --> 00:00:52.519 
after that it was pretty much just

00:00:52.519 --> 00:00:56.779 
after that it was pretty much just
Bolton<00:00:53.519> the<00:00:53.730> new<00:00:54.539> exhaust<00:00:54.899> and<00:00:55.579> the<00:00:56.579> new

00:00:56.779 --> 00:00:56.789 
Bolton the new exhaust and the new

00:00:56.789 --> 00:01:00.169 
Bolton the new exhaust and the new
headers<00:00:57.059> on<00:00:58.160> the<00:00:59.160> only<00:00:59.280> problems<00:00:59.789> I<00:00:59.940> really

00:01:00.169 --> 00:01:00.179 
headers on the only problems I really

00:01:00.179 --> 00:01:05.150 
headers on the only problems I really
ran<00:01:00.359> into<00:01:00.780> were<00:01:01.670> in<00:01:02.670> a<00:01:02.789> couple<00:01:03.179> places<00:01:03.230> the<00:01:04.230> new

00:01:05.150 --> 00:01:05.160 
ran into were in a couple places the new

00:01:05.160 --> 00:01:07.580 
ran into were in a couple places the new
headers<00:01:05.489> were<00:01:05.760> touching<00:01:06.450> the<00:01:06.690> fairings<00:01:07.080> and

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:07.590 
headers were touching the fairings and

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:09.590 
headers were touching the fairings and
kind<00:01:08.340> of<00:01:08.430> melted<00:01:08.790> it<00:01:08.910> on<00:01:09.060> the<00:01:09.150> bottom<00:01:09.480> a<00:01:09.510> little

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:09.600 
kind of melted it on the bottom a little

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:14.719 
kind of melted it on the bottom a little
bit<00:01:10.010> but<00:01:11.010> uh<00:01:11.040> I<00:01:11.780> used<00:01:12.780> some<00:01:13.310> aluminum<00:01:14.310> exhaust

00:01:14.719 --> 00:01:14.729 
bit but uh I used some aluminum exhaust

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:16.940 
bit but uh I used some aluminum exhaust
repair<00:01:15.180> tape<00:01:15.420> and<00:01:15.720> just<00:01:15.750> double<00:01:16.500> layered<00:01:16.680> it

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:16.950 
repair tape and just double layered it

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:20.780 
repair tape and just double layered it
wherever<00:01:17.189> it<00:01:17.729> was<00:01:18.570> touching<00:01:18.869> underneath<00:01:19.790> and

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:20.790 
wherever it was touching underneath and

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:23.859 
wherever it was touching underneath and
so<00:01:21.780> far<00:01:22.049> and<00:01:22.350> then<00:01:22.500> had<00:01:22.770> any<00:01:22.979> more<00:01:23.130> problems

00:01:23.859 --> 00:01:23.869 
so far and then had any more problems

00:01:23.869 --> 00:01:26.300 
so far and then had any more problems
another<00:01:24.869> problem<00:01:25.290> that's<00:01:25.409> been<00:01:25.590> reported<00:01:26.130> by

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:26.310 
another problem that's been reported by

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:28.819 
another problem that's been reported by
other<00:01:26.939> people<00:01:27.329> that<00:01:27.450> have<00:01:27.570> done<00:01:27.720> it<00:01:27.780> is<00:01:28.470> that

00:01:28.819 --> 00:01:28.829 
other people that have done it is that

00:01:28.829 --> 00:01:34.130 
other people that have done it is that
the<00:01:29.689> exhaust<00:01:30.689> the<00:01:32.270> second<00:01:33.270> runner<00:01:33.450> there<00:01:33.780> is<00:01:34.079> a

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:34.140 
the exhaust the second runner there is a

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:35.899 
the exhaust the second runner there is a
little<00:01:34.439> bit<00:01:34.560> closer<00:01:34.799> than<00:01:35.159> the<00:01:35.280> old<00:01:35.430> one<00:01:35.670> to

00:01:35.899 --> 00:01:35.909 
little bit closer than the old one to

00:01:35.909 --> 00:01:40.039 
little bit closer than the old one to
the<00:01:36.060> air<00:01:36.240> oil<00:01:36.630> filter<00:01:37.310> so<00:01:38.780> I'm<00:01:39.780> not<00:01:39.899> really

00:01:40.039 --> 00:01:40.049 
the air oil filter so I'm not really

00:01:40.049 --> 00:01:41.690 
the air oil filter so I'm not really
sure<00:01:40.200> if<00:01:40.439> I'll<00:01:40.560> have<00:01:40.710> any<00:01:40.860> problems<00:01:41.280> removing

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:41.700 
sure if I'll have any problems removing

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:44.090 
sure if I'll have any problems removing
it<00:01:41.820> when<00:01:41.909> I<00:01:41.939> do<00:01:42.060> my<00:01:42.270> oil<00:01:42.540> change<00:01:42.810> it<00:01:43.110> but<00:01:43.409> if<00:01:43.920> I

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:44.100 
it when I do my oil change it but if I

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:46.190 
it when I do my oil change it but if I
do<00:01:44.159> then<00:01:44.579> I<00:01:44.909> guess<00:01:45.450> I'll<00:01:45.659> deal<00:01:45.869> with<00:01:45.930> it<00:01:46.140> when

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:46.200 
do then I guess I'll deal with it when

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:51.730 
do then I guess I'll deal with it when
the<00:01:47.159> time<00:01:47.340> comes<00:01:48.020> but<00:01:49.219> that's<00:01:50.219> pretty<00:01:50.549> much<00:01:50.670> it

00:01:51.730 --> 00:01:51.740 
the time comes but that's pretty much it

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:55.929 
the time comes but that's pretty much it
the<00:01:52.740> sound<00:01:53.009> I<00:01:53.310> would<00:01:53.490> say<00:01:53.729> is<00:01:54.000> probably<00:01:54.360> I

00:01:55.929 --> 00:01:55.939 
the sound I would say is probably I

00:01:55.939 --> 00:01:59.420 
the sound I would say is probably I
think<00:01:56.939> 10<00:01:57.119> times<00:01:57.149> better<00:01:57.539> than<00:01:57.869> the<00:01:58.140> yoshi<00:01:58.590> rs3

00:01:59.420 --> 00:01:59.430 
think 10 times better than the yoshi rs3

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:02.779 
think 10 times better than the yoshi rs3
that<00:01:59.579> I<00:01:59.610> had<00:01:59.820> on<00:01:59.969> it<00:02:00.170> it's<00:02:01.170> probably<00:02:01.680> a<00:02:02.039> little

00:02:02.779 --> 00:02:02.789 
that I had on it it's probably a little

00:02:02.789 --> 00:02:04.120 
that I had on it it's probably a little
bit<00:02:02.939> louder<00:02:03.270> than

00:02:04.120 --> 00:02:04.130 
bit louder than

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:05.770 
bit louder than
three<00:02:04.460> not<00:02:04.820> as<00:02:04.969> well<00:02:05.149> as<00:02:05.270> I<00:02:05.360> thought<00:02:05.540> it<00:02:05.689> would

00:02:05.770 --> 00:02:05.780 
three not as well as I thought it would

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:10.690 
three not as well as I thought it would
be<00:02:07.630> but<00:02:08.630> yes<00:02:09.050> I'm<00:02:09.530> pretty<00:02:09.800> pleased<00:02:10.099> with<00:02:10.130> it<00:02:10.429> so

00:02:10.690 --> 00:02:10.700 
be but yes I'm pretty pleased with it so

00:02:10.700 --> 00:02:14.050 
be but yes I'm pretty pleased with it so
I<00:02:11.200> don't<00:02:12.200> have<00:02:12.410> a<00:02:12.470> GoPro<00:02:12.980> yet<00:02:13.190> I<00:02:13.430> hope<00:02:13.760> to<00:02:13.940> have

00:02:14.050 --> 00:02:14.060 
I don't have a GoPro yet I hope to have

00:02:14.060 --> 00:02:16.750 
I don't have a GoPro yet I hope to have
one<00:02:14.120> in<00:02:14.480> about<00:02:14.599> three<00:02:15.560> weeks<00:02:15.590> maybe<00:02:16.430> four

00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:16.760 
one in about three weeks maybe four

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:20.290 
one in about three weeks maybe four
weeks<00:02:17.000> and<00:02:17.300> then<00:02:17.560> I'll<00:02:18.560> get<00:02:19.489> some<00:02:19.700> video<00:02:19.970> of

00:02:20.290 --> 00:02:20.300 
weeks and then I'll get some video of

00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:23.199 
weeks and then I'll get some video of
how<00:02:20.870> it<00:02:21.019> sounds<00:02:21.380> on<00:02:21.500> the<00:02:21.620> bike<00:02:21.800> but<00:02:22.760> for<00:02:23.090> now

00:02:23.199 --> 00:02:23.209 
how it sounds on the bike but for now

00:02:23.209 --> 00:02:25.960 
how it sounds on the bike but for now
I'll<00:02:23.450> probably<00:02:23.660> just<00:02:24.110> do<00:02:24.709> a<00:02:24.739> drive-by<00:02:25.519> of<00:02:25.849> the

00:02:25.960 --> 00:02:25.970 
I'll probably just do a drive-by of the

00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:29.890 
I'll probably just do a drive-by of the
camera<00:02:26.360> maybe<00:02:27.319> second<00:02:27.950> or<00:02:28.040> third<00:02:28.250> gear<00:02:28.489> and<00:02:28.940> I

00:02:29.890 --> 00:02:29.900 
camera maybe second or third gear and I

00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:33.280 
camera maybe second or third gear and I
guess<00:02:30.530> I'll<00:02:30.739> have<00:02:30.980> to<00:02:31.130> do<00:02:31.250> for<00:02:31.400> half<00:02:31.580> so<00:02:32.290> I'm

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:33.290 
guess I'll have to do for half so I'm

00:02:33.290 --> 00:02:35.110 
guess I'll have to do for half so I'm
going<00:02:33.440> to<00:02:33.470> go<00:02:33.590> out<00:02:33.739> and<00:02:33.980> film<00:02:34.580> that<00:02:34.760> and<00:02:34.940> then

00:02:35.110 --> 00:02:35.120 
going to go out and film that and then

00:02:35.120 --> 00:05:10.790 
going to go out and film that and then
