00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:25.510 
difference well the difference between
the<00:02:22.280> two<00:02:22.520> is<00:02:22.790> that<00:02:23.150> this<00:02:23.740> takes<00:02:24.740> me<00:02:25.070> about<00:02:25.280> an

00:02:25.510 --> 00:02:25.520 
the two is that this takes me about an

00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:27.970 
the two is that this takes me about an
hour<00:02:25.760> and<00:02:26.030> a<00:02:26.090> half<00:02:26.360> to<00:02:26.780> put<00:02:27.170> throughout<00:02:27.800> my

00:02:27.970 --> 00:02:27.980 
hour and a half to put throughout my

00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:32.230 
hour and a half to put throughout my
whole<00:02:28.190> hair<00:02:28.520> and<00:02:28.880> pull<00:02:29.660> with<00:02:30.290> the<00:02:30.410> comb<00:02:30.650> ah<00:02:31.240> and

00:02:32.230 --> 00:02:32.240 
whole hair and pull with the comb ah and

00:02:32.240 --> 00:02:35.470 
whole hair and pull with the comb ah and
it<00:02:32.990> takes<00:02:33.200> a<00:02:33.290> while<00:02:33.320> for<00:02:33.500> it<00:02:33.740> to<00:02:33.800> activate<00:02:34.480> with

00:02:35.470 --> 00:02:35.480 
it takes a while for it to activate with

00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:40.330 
it takes a while for it to activate with
the<00:02:35.660> extra<00:02:36.110> strength<00:02:36.500> what<00:02:37.460> I've<00:02:37.640> noticed<00:02:39.340> yes

00:02:40.330 --> 00:02:40.340 
the extra strength what I've noticed yes

00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:43.690 
the extra strength what I've noticed yes
go<00:02:40.520> what<00:02:41.210> I've<00:02:41.330> noticed<00:02:41.630> is<00:02:42.020> that<00:02:42.440> the<00:02:43.220> minute

00:02:43.690 --> 00:02:43.700 
go what I've noticed is that the minute

00:02:43.700 --> 00:02:46.300 
go what I've noticed is that the minute
I<00:02:43.880> start<00:02:44.180> applying<00:02:44.510> it<00:02:44.780> boom<00:02:45.470> it<00:02:45.800> starts

00:02:46.300 --> 00:02:46.310 
I start applying it boom it starts

00:02:46.310 --> 00:02:48.970 
I start applying it boom it starts
working<00:02:46.700> now<00:02:47.690> I<00:02:47.990> thought<00:02:48.410> I<00:02:48.650> was<00:02:48.800> going<00:02:48.890> to

00:02:48.970 --> 00:02:48.980

00:02:58.330 --> 00:02:58.340 
to happen so after the extra strength

00:02:58.340 --> 00:03:00.880 
to happen so after the extra strength
that<00:02:58.880> I<00:02:59.180> kept<00:02:59.720> in<00:02:59.810> my<00:02:59.930> hair<00:03:00.080> for<00:03:00.230> about<00:03:00.260> 40

00:03:20.590 --> 00:03:20.600 
out and the whole time I thought oh my

00:03:20.600 --> 00:03:23.080 
out and the whole time I thought oh my
gosh<00:03:20.810> I<00:03:21.020> hope<00:03:21.260> I<00:03:21.380> didn't<00:03:21.650> pull<00:03:21.890> too<00:03:22.580> much<00:03:22.760> with

00:03:23.080 --> 00:03:23.090 
gosh I hope I didn't pull too much with

00:03:23.090 --> 00:03:26.470 
gosh I hope I didn't pull too much with
the<00:03:23.210> comb<00:03:23.420> and<00:03:23.750> I<00:03:24.560> pull<00:03:25.220> with<00:03:25.520> a<00:03:25.730> fine-tooth

00:03:26.470 --> 00:03:26.480 
the comb and I pull with a fine-tooth

00:03:26.480 --> 00:03:28.410 
the comb and I pull with a fine-tooth
comb<00:03:26.690> and<00:03:27.230> when<00:03:27.410> another<00:03:27.620> cold<00:03:27.830> it's<00:03:28.100> whiter

00:03:28.410 --> 00:03:28.420 
comb and when another cold it's whiter

00:03:28.420 --> 00:03:32.380 
comb and when another cold it's whiter
whiter<00:03:29.420> tooth<00:03:29.690> and<00:03:29.950> I<00:03:30.950> thought<00:03:31.490> I<00:03:31.880> don't<00:03:32.210> want

00:03:32.380 --> 00:03:32.390 
whiter tooth and I thought I don't want

00:03:32.390 --> 00:03:34.060 
whiter tooth and I thought I don't want
my<00:03:32.630> hair<00:03:32.840> to<00:03:32.960> be<00:03:32.990> completely<00:03:33.560> bone<00:03:33.740> straight

00:03:34.060 --> 00:03:34.070 
my hair to be completely bone straight

00:03:34.070 --> 00:03:35.560 
my hair to be completely bone straight
well<00:03:34.340> turns<00:03:34.610> out<00:03:34.730> that<00:03:34.790> it's<00:03:35.060> not<00:03:35.150> bone

00:03:35.560 --> 00:03:35.570 
well turns out that it's not bone

00:03:35.570 --> 00:03:37.360 
well turns out that it's not bone
straight<00:03:35.870> and<00:03:36.080> I<00:03:36.140> think<00:03:36.680> it's<00:03:36.860> ever<00:03:37.070> going<00:03:37.280> to

00:03:37.360 --> 00:03:37.370 
straight and I think it's ever going to

00:03:37.370 --> 00:03:39.670 
straight and I think it's ever going to
be<00:03:37.430> bone<00:03:37.670> straight<00:03:37.940> however<00:03:38.870> with<00:03:39.110> the<00:03:39.230> extra

00:03:39.670 --> 00:03:39.680 
be bone straight however with the extra

00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:41.950 
be bone straight however with the extra
strength<00:03:40.100> the<00:03:40.730> advantage<00:03:41.180> is<00:03:41.330> that<00:03:41.360> it<00:03:41.540> works

00:03:41.950 --> 00:03:41.960 
strength the advantage is that it works

00:03:41.960 --> 00:03:45.340 
strength the advantage is that it works
faster<00:03:42.710> I<00:03:42.980> don't<00:03:43.670> have<00:03:43.850> to<00:03:44.030> pull<00:03:44.390> as<00:03:44.690> much<00:03:45.020> so

00:03:45.340 --> 00:03:45.350 
faster I don't have to pull as much so

00:03:45.350 --> 00:03:47.290 
faster I don't have to pull as much so
it's<00:03:45.530> much<00:03:45.920> healthier<00:03:46.160> for<00:03:46.640> my<00:03:46.760> hair<00:03:47.000> because

00:03:47.290 --> 00:03:47.300 
it's much healthier for my hair because

00:03:47.300 --> 00:03:52.270 
it's much healthier for my hair because
before<00:03:47.780> with<00:03:48.470> the<00:03:48.740> UM<00:03:49.570> the<00:03:50.570> normal<00:03:51.440> I<00:03:51.650> have<00:03:52.130> to

00:03:52.270 --> 00:03:52.280 
before with the UM the normal I have to

00:03:52.280 --> 00:03:53.950 
before with the UM the normal I have to
pull<00:03:52.520> and<00:03:52.760> pull<00:03:52.940> and<00:03:52.970> pull<00:03:53.150> and<00:03:53.330> pull<00:03:53.540> and<00:03:53.750> pull

00:03:53.950 --> 00:03:53.960 
pull and pull and pull and pull and pull

00:03:53.960 --> 00:03:56.170 
pull and pull and pull and pull and pull

00:03:56.170 --> 00:03:56.180 
and pull and pull and pull it my

00:03:56.180 --> 00:03:58.750 
and pull and pull and pull it my
straightening<00:03:56.990> it<00:03:57.110> smooths<00:03:57.470> it<00:03:57.950> down<00:03:58.370> with<00:03:58.640> my

00:03:58.750 --> 00:03:58.760 
straightening it smooths it down with my

00:03:58.760 --> 00:04:00.460 
straightening it smooths it down with my
fingers<00:03:59.240> that<00:03:59.360> pull<00:03:59.630> with<00:03:59.750> the<00:03:59.870> Komen<00:04:00.290> it's

00:04:00.460 --> 00:04:00.470 
fingers that pull with the Komen it's

00:04:00.470 --> 00:04:02.440 
fingers that pull with the Komen it's
just<00:04:00.770> I<00:04:00.980> don't<00:04:01.070> think<00:04:01.340> in<00:04:01.670> the<00:04:01.760> long<00:04:01.940> term<00:04:02.180> all

00:04:02.440 --> 00:04:02.450 
just I don't think in the long term all

00:04:02.450 --> 00:04:04.840 
just I don't think in the long term all
that<00:04:02.750> good<00:04:03.020> but<00:04:03.680> with<00:04:03.830> the<00:04:03.980> extra<00:04:04.310> strength<00:04:04.610> I

00:04:04.840 --> 00:04:04.850 
that good but with the extra strength I

00:04:04.850 --> 00:04:05.770 
that good but with the extra strength I
don't<00:04:05.120> have<00:04:05.240> to<00:04:05.390> do<00:04:05.480> that

00:04:05.770 --> 00:04:05.780 
don't have to do that

00:04:05.780 --> 00:04:08.080 
don't have to do that
the<00:04:05.870> other<00:04:06.050> advantage<00:04:06.620> that<00:04:06.770> I<00:04:06.800> can<00:04:07.010> see<00:04:07.250> as<00:04:07.460> my

00:04:08.080 --> 00:04:08.090 
the other advantage that I can see as my

00:04:08.090 --> 00:04:09.910 
the other advantage that I can see as my
hair<00:04:08.300> starts<00:04:08.720> growing<00:04:08.750> longer

00:04:09.910 --> 00:04:09.920 
hair starts growing longer

00:04:09.920 --> 00:04:11.980 
hair starts growing longer
I<00:04:09.950> can't<00:04:10.580> wait<00:04:10.850> and<00:04:11.450> I'm<00:04:11.540> going<00:04:11.720> to<00:04:11.780> show<00:04:11.960> you

00:04:50.410 --> 00:04:50.420 
be careful because if my scalp is very

00:04:50.420 --> 00:04:53.690 
be careful because if my scalp is very
delicate<00:04:51.420> then<00:04:51.930> the<00:04:52.050> extra<00:04:52.470> strength<00:04:52.920> might

00:04:53.690 --> 00:04:53.700 
delicate then the extra strength might

00:04:53.700 --> 00:04:56.030 
delicate then the extra strength might
burn<00:04:53.970> but<00:04:54.270> my<00:04:54.540> scalp<00:04:54.870> is<00:04:55.050> very<00:04:55.380> resistant
