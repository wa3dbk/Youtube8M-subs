 called canon 700d 

00:00:13.340 --> 00:00:24.779
 open the box and see I got my 

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:26.820
 I bought a camera from me 

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:30.000
 without a lens because I have a lens 

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:32.540
 It was a camera and a microphone too 

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:35.480
 buy this carcass separately 

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:40.410
 I have instructions in Russian and 

00:00:35.480 --> 00:00:41.730
 instruction in Kazakh on disk 

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:45.300
 installation 

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:47.100
 the battery goes further 

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:49.530
 charger with wire and 

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:51.660
 the charger then we see here 

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:55.199
 such wires yusbi through which we 

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:56.309
 see our camera connect the computer and 

00:00:55.199 --> 00:00:59.520
 last thing 

00:00:56.309 --> 00:01:04.350
 what i'm wearing my camera now 

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:07.729
 this is a wire holder branded canon 

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:11.580
 at first you are not this little ponytail 

00:01:07.729 --> 00:01:12.479
 take out 1 part of the tail from the stub and 

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:16.380
 plug 

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:22.790
 leave down then we will sell the tail 

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:24.770
 ear and tip sell in the cap 

00:01:22.790 --> 00:01:27.950
 remaining small tip 

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:32.939
 about his day back inside the clip 

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:33.680
 as he was originally Well, that's 

00:01:32.939 --> 00:01:36.930
 everything 

00:01:33.680 --> 00:01:40.530
 digital canon 700d 

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:43.890
 This is an entry-level SLR for those 

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:44.850
 who wants to try yourself in photography 

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:48.630
 video filming 

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:50.670
 this is not a very expensive camera but with this 

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:53.250
 cameras you can get cool 

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:54.930
 image as photo and video i am this 

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:58.110
 Camera chose to shoot 

00:01:54.930 --> 00:02:01.229
 videos on youtube and on your 

00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:02.790
 The characteristics of this camera is very cool 

00:02:01.229 --> 00:02:04.950
 it suits me because I want 

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:08.759
 quality picture that 

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:11.489
 full hd and accordingly you can set 

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:13.379
 different lenses that give different 

00:02:11.489 --> 00:02:16.230
 depth of field that is it will be possible 

00:02:13.379 --> 00:02:19.290
 blur background for beauty video well 

00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:21.650
 or shoot at infinite distance 

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:25.140
 that is, on the street and or in some other 

00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:26.930
 conditions I bought myself a carcass but here 

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:31.980
 any lenses fit 

00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:34.980
 which and ef-s series that is more 

00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:37.170
 cool lenses for professional 

00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:40.310
 court cameras are no longer suitable in principle 

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:42.480
 can this DSLR be called even 

00:02:40.310 --> 00:02:45.120
 semi-professional protection 

00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:47.549
 some features but i would advise 

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:49.680
 choose those who have not yet had a story 

00:02:47.549 --> 00:02:52.680
 with his hands a DSLR that shoots 

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:56.130
 the video is quite claim to be 

00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:57.150
 Excellent version of the first SLR with 

00:02:56.130 --> 00:03:00.000
 video features 

00:02:57.150 --> 00:03:02.640
 this camera has one big 

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:04.680
 only advantage from which I drew 

00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:07.230
 attention is on her this flip 

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:10.319
 swivel screen that allows with it 

00:03:07.230 --> 00:03:13.410
 very very convenient to shoot video format 

00:03:10.319 --> 00:03:16.950
 beauty you can see yourself and you can 

00:03:13.410 --> 00:03:19.590
 see what you shoot further with this 

00:03:16.950 --> 00:03:22.739
 cameras are all possible manual 

00:03:19.590 --> 00:03:25.380
 settings meaning you can put m 

00:03:22.739 --> 00:03:27.709
 yes it will be completely menu and then you 

00:03:25.380 --> 00:03:30.510
 can install 

00:03:27.709 --> 00:03:32.579
 aperture shutter speed all by hand 

00:03:30.510 --> 00:03:34.470
 here you can also customize the button 

00:03:32.579 --> 00:03:37.109
 can customize exposes 

00:03:34.470 --> 00:03:40.350
 what you need from a generally functional 

00:03:37.109 --> 00:03:42.630
 very similar to any SLR camera 

00:03:40.350 --> 00:03:47.010
 Here is this segment I have before this 

00:03:42.630 --> 00:03:49.920
 was the nikon d40 exactly the camera and up 

00:03:47.010 --> 00:03:53.849
 this one was also another canon 

00:03:49.920 --> 00:03:55.440
 models are all very similar functions 

00:03:53.849 --> 00:03:57.720
 control i mean i won't be now 

00:03:55.440 --> 00:03:59.070
 tell in detail 

00:03:57.720 --> 00:04:00.720
 to compare technical 

00:03:59.070 --> 00:04:01.230
 characteristics you can do on 

00:04:00.720 --> 00:04:04.170
 the site 

00:04:01.230 --> 00:04:09.590
 what I want to point out especially while this 

00:04:04.170 --> 00:04:11.610
 cameras have the ability to focus 

00:04:09.590 --> 00:04:13.920
 use lenses which 

00:04:11.610 --> 00:04:17.160
 automatically focus it very 

00:04:13.920 --> 00:04:20.370
 cool as well here is all the more good 

00:04:17.160 --> 00:04:22.860
 option to focus than to eat 

00:04:20.370 --> 00:04:25.620
 650d that is, if you have for example already 

00:04:22.860 --> 00:04:28.350
 there is 650d canon of course you do not make sense 

00:04:25.620 --> 00:04:30.390
 buy 700 before it's obvious but if u 

00:04:28.350 --> 00:04:32.820
 you have no camera which 

00:04:30.390 --> 00:04:36.390
 shoots video then this 

00:04:32.820 --> 00:04:39.500
 700d for you super cool suit that 

00:04:36.390 --> 00:04:40.650
 I would also note there is a way out for 

00:04:39.500 --> 00:04:43.470
 microphone 

00:04:40.650 --> 00:04:45.660
 it is very important because your own 

00:04:43.470 --> 00:04:47.280
 microphone is located here somewhere here 

00:04:45.660 --> 00:04:50.520
 above here are these two holes 

00:04:47.280 --> 00:04:52.740
 which I don't know what they can catch 

00:04:50.520 --> 00:04:54.330
 I read a lot of reviews that 

00:04:52.740 --> 00:04:56.490
 evidence that is necessary 

00:04:54.330 --> 00:04:58.200
 buy a portable microphone you can 

00:04:56.490 --> 00:05:01.470
 buy naturally what we want here 

00:04:58.200 --> 00:05:04.050
 here bought this one naturally 

00:05:01.470 --> 00:05:06.240
 choose between kid &amp; body I would give you 

00:05:04.050 --> 00:05:08.730
 advised to take the whale if you do not 

00:05:06.240 --> 00:05:10.560
 their lenses but it’s natural to take 

00:05:08.730 --> 00:05:12.660
 body if we simply return the teams there 

00:05:10.560 --> 00:05:15.540
 we have our own lenses so we 

00:05:12.660 --> 00:05:18.450
 take yourself will be one usually if you 

00:05:15.540 --> 00:05:21.090
 buy this whale is cheaper 

00:05:18.450 --> 00:05:22.800
 if you separately buy the gods separate 

00:05:21.090 --> 00:05:26.160
 the lens is therefore daisy 

00:05:22.800 --> 00:05:29.910
 there is no lens note at all but in principle 

00:05:26.160 --> 00:05:32.130
 here it is my new camera I am very pleased with 

00:05:29.910 --> 00:05:34.620
 you will learn from acquisitions 

00:05:32.130 --> 00:05:41.040
 shoot a video format on it 

00:05:34.620 --> 00:05:42.990
 it turns out move shoots 25 frames and you 

00:05:41.040 --> 00:05:45.300
 you can have a huge amount here 

00:05:42.990 --> 00:05:47.100
 Preset settings I mean, honestly 

00:05:45.300 --> 00:05:47.430
 I didn’t even understand how to 

00:05:47.100 --> 00:05:49.530
 what 

00:05:47.430 --> 00:05:52.500
 but with the mind is very simple here 

00:05:49.530 --> 00:05:55.919
 There is a video button that turns on and 

00:05:52.500 --> 00:05:57.169
 start shooting sd memory cards better 

00:05:55.919 --> 00:05:59.870
 take 

00:05:57.169 --> 00:06:01.759
 higher speed cards that is 

00:05:59.870 --> 00:06:03.710
 if you buy some primitive 

00:06:01.759 --> 00:06:08.090
 sd card on it may be bad 

00:06:03.710 --> 00:06:10.189
 video will be recorded but will be lost until 

00:06:08.090 --> 00:06:12.639
 information so take as much as possible 

00:06:10.189 --> 00:06:16.039
 speed cards with d 

00:06:12.639 --> 00:06:17.930
 battery 1 and I think that will have 

00:06:16.039 --> 00:06:20.029
 buy one more battery after all 

00:06:17.930 --> 00:06:23.270
 it is such a sheep even quickly 

00:06:20.029 --> 00:06:25.400
 ends before and file 1 video is 

00:06:23.270 --> 00:06:27.229
 four gigabytes after that it creates 

00:06:25.400 --> 00:06:30.409
 new file i mean you average 

00:06:27.229 --> 00:06:32.779
 write somewhere don't know if good 

00:06:30.409 --> 00:06:36.199
 the quality is there for 20-30 minutes and then 

00:06:32.779 --> 00:06:38.629
 the next file is created and so i 

00:06:36.199 --> 00:06:40.249
 advised to take a card for more and 

00:06:38.629 --> 00:06:42.830
 larger because files 

00:06:40.249 --> 00:06:44.870
 turn out heavy one this whole 

00:06:42.830 --> 00:06:46.610
 my first impression is my first 

00:06:44.870 --> 00:06:50.689
 some thoughts i hope you too 

00:06:46.610 --> 00:06:53.930
 share your comments and yours 

00:06:50.689 --> 00:06:56.689

 plan video please photo i understand 

00:06:56.689 --> 00:07:01.610

 I hope that everything worked out for me 

00:07:22.250 --> 00:07:30.669
 I set the shutter speed correctly at 5050 

00:07:26.469 --> 00:07:34.520
 aperture 40 and iso 400 if you 

00:07:30.669 --> 00:07:37.879
 move on like this an hour a little under 

00:07:34.520 --> 00:07:40.189
 We focus beautiful very cool 

00:07:37.879 --> 00:07:44.620
 picture you can match previous 

00:07:40.189 --> 00:07:48.500
