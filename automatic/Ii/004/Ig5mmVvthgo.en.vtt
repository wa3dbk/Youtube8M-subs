00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:35.070
 apricots 

00:00:33.149 --> 00:00:37.440
 we begin to prepare our cake 

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:40.440
 we take the preparation for madeira e 

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:43.050
 we pour into our bowl we take 

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:45.660
 the eggs we also put the butter in the 

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:46.969
 terrine and add our own 

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:49.350
 lemon spoon 

00:00:46.969 --> 00:00:52.079
 we mix with our planetary for 

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:57.180
 five minutes at high speed and la 

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:59.160
 our base for madeira is ready ok 

00:00:57.180 --> 00:01:01.500
 we can safely transfer it 

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:04.710
 in the square pan previously 

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:08.130
 buttered and floured and then baked 

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:09.930
 at 160 degrees in an electric oven for 70 

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:11.460
 minutes while the cakes in the oven 

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:13.380
 prepare the butter cream for the 

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:14.670
 our glaze put it first 

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:16.439
 icing sugar in the bowl 

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:18.659
 add our butter 

00:01:16.439 --> 00:01:20.400
 previously softened we start with 

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:23.909
 a low speed and then increase 

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:26.610
 gradually our matera is ready 

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:28.530
 we must first remove the 

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:30.780
 surface of the cake of course 

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:32.970
 surface will not be thrown away but we can 

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:35.430
 use it to make cake boxes 

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:37.170
 at this point we turn our cake e 

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:37.619
 let's go on to the icing with the cream 

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:39.659

00:01:37.619 --> 00:01:41.490
 let's remember to frost even a 

00:01:39.659 --> 00:01:43.170
 little the tray because the cream to 

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:44.070
 butter will serve us as a glue for the 

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:45.840
 sugar paste 

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:48.450

00:01:54.760 --> 00:01:58.869
