install<00:01:12.510> a<00:01:12.570> piece<00:01:12.840> of<00:01:12.869> code<00:01:13.800> on<00:01:14.010> every<00:01:14.130> on

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:14.460 
install a piece of code on every on

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:16.490 
install a piece of code on every on
every<00:01:14.820> video<00:01:15.000> was<00:01:15.240> it<00:01:15.390> literally<00:01:16.320> a

00:01:54.559 --> 00:01:54.569 
it's a simple JavaScript now that's all

00:01:54.569 --> 00:01:57.050

with video promotion this way um it's

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:06.740 
with video promotion this way um it's
the<00:02:04.770> same<00:02:04.979> as<00:02:05.160> most<00:02:05.700> affiliate<00:02:06.390> programs

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:06.750 
the same as most affiliate programs

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:08.960 
the same as most affiliate programs
where<00:02:07.009> the<00:02:08.009> best<00:02:08.190> products<00:02:08.550> usually<00:02:08.670> are<00:02:08.910> the

00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:08.970 
where the best products usually are the

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:11.210 
where the best products usually are the
ones<00:02:09.119> that<00:02:09.179> convert<00:02:09.539> the<00:02:09.660> best<00:02:09.869> so<00:02:10.590> leads<00:02:11.009> do

00:02:11.210 --> 00:02:11.220 
ones that convert the best so leads do

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:13.430 
ones that convert the best so leads do
really<00:02:11.490> well<00:02:11.640> in<00:02:11.700> the<00:02:12.000> program<00:02:12.390> because<00:02:13.290> they

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:13.440 
really well in the program because they

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:14.960 
really well in the program because they
convert<00:02:13.800> really<00:02:14.040> well<00:02:14.220> and<00:02:14.370> so<00:02:14.520> you<00:02:14.580> just<00:02:14.760> get

00:02:14.960 --> 00:02:14.970 
convert really well and so you just get

00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:16.970 
convert really well and so you just get
that<00:02:15.150> video<00:02:15.330> up<00:02:15.600> there<00:02:15.870> you<00:02:16.530> get<00:02:16.680> people

00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:16.980 
that video up there you get people
