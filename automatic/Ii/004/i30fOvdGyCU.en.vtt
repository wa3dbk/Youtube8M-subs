00:00:02.649 --> 00:00:07.640
 Today in Cochabamba the 

00:00:05.060 --> 00:00:10.270
 presentation of a giant project 

00:00:07.640 --> 00:00:12.680
 culture that seeks beyond 

00:00:10.270 --> 00:00:15.230
 organize an international festival in 

00:00:12.680 --> 00:00:17.570
 cochabamba bolivia parallel and better 

00:00:15.230 --> 00:00:19.670
 in quotes much better than 

00:00:17.570 --> 00:00:21.890
 ViÃ±a del Mar festival because it pretends to be 

00:00:19.670 --> 00:00:24.650
 a stage for many other mega 

00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:26.720
 events we tell you next 

00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:28.430
 different institutions started the 

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:30.410
 last year the project with a single purpose 

00:00:28.430 --> 00:00:32.150
 show Bolivia and the world the 

00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:34.790
 diversity of folklore of our country 

00:00:32.150 --> 00:00:37.100
 a goal the construction of a theater at 

00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:38.270
 outdoors with capacity for more than 20 

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:39.829
 Thousand spectators 

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:42.530
 family letters because it 's a 

00:00:39.829 --> 00:00:44.720
 almost almost fierce detachment of 

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:45.800
 affection of feelings cochabamba and 

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:47.989
 we have done in his 

00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:50.420
 opportunity simply to carry with 

00:00:47.989 --> 00:00:51.949
 some agreements because we have 

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:54.680
 determined as authorities of that 

00:00:51.949 --> 00:00:57.170
 moment like our caracas brothers and 

00:00:54.680 --> 00:01:00.320
 the architecture students more together 

00:00:57.170 --> 00:01:01.879
 some teachers and he and the director of 

00:01:00.320 --> 00:01:03.229
 that I'm going to allow myself more 

00:01:01.879 --> 00:01:05.510
 humiliating our Bolivian artists 

00:01:03.229 --> 00:01:07.250
 third-year students in the career of 

00:01:05.510 --> 00:01:09.770
 architecture of san major university 

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:12.140
 Simon took the challenge to the contest 

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:14.479
 presented more than 30 three projects 

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:16.850
 were the preselected ones since 

00:01:14.479 --> 00:01:18.890
 our architects and the young 

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:21.950
 architects are the best dreamers 

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:24.320
 the best designers we made a great 

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:26.780
 contest like this because everything starts to 

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:29.050
 white had more something of 20 

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:32.410
 Projects 

00:01:29.050 --> 00:01:34.210
 we choose three are the three here the 

00:01:32.410 --> 00:01:37.620
 three that we're going to see that they have 

00:01:34.210 --> 00:01:40.660
 different qualities different tapie 

00:01:37.620 --> 00:01:42.490
 visions of how it can be a 

00:01:40.660 --> 00:01:44.410
 structure Bolivian artists of 

00:01:42.490 --> 00:01:46.270
 recognized prestige at the national level and 

00:01:44.410 --> 00:01:48.010
 International met in Cochabamba 

00:01:46.270 --> 00:01:50.070
 to receive the news of the 

00:01:48.010 --> 00:01:52.990
 national and departmental authorities 

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:54.930
 have a unique scenario in the country with 

00:01:52.990 --> 00:01:56.800
 international characteristics 

00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:58.390
 He definitely needed the 

00:01:56.800 --> 00:01:59.830
 we make pilgrimages and suffer 

00:01:58.390 --> 00:02:02.110
 very much when we want to do 

00:01:59.830 --> 00:02:04.660
 concerts in stadiums in curve we take 

00:02:02.110 --> 00:02:07.270
 months to find a curve that 

00:02:04.660 --> 00:02:09.010
 It is free because there are no parties 

00:02:07.270 --> 00:02:11.590
 international concerts then 

00:02:09.010 --> 00:02:13.900
 we suffer a lot for big spaces and 

00:02:11.590 --> 00:02:16.000
 I think that this space needed 

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:18.310
 bolivia and to the general art I think that a 

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:21.310
 fantastic idea all artists 

00:02:18.310 --> 00:02:25.390
 we are summoned to be able to support 

00:02:21.310 --> 00:02:28.210
 this project that is urgent and necessary 

00:02:25.390 --> 00:02:30.850
 a space where national production 

00:02:28.210 --> 00:02:33.250
 our music can be disseminated to 

00:02:30.850 --> 00:02:35.650
 world music is the universal language 

00:02:33.250 --> 00:02:36.069
 par excellence and artists of different 

00:02:35.650 --> 00:02:38.049
 gender 

00:02:36.069 --> 00:02:40.060
 applaud the willingness to do 

00:02:38.049 --> 00:02:42.430
 reality one of his greatest dreams 

00:02:40.060 --> 00:02:45.069
 a scenario that allows performances in 

00:02:42.430 --> 00:02:48.999
 I live with quality and cutting-edge technology 

00:02:45.069 --> 00:02:51.790
 It's something historic and good because I think 

00:02:48.999 --> 00:02:53.889
 that all artists should support him 

00:02:51.790 --> 00:02:55.780
 and endorse it because it's going to be a 

00:02:53.889 --> 00:02:58.180
 scenario where we can show everything 

00:02:55.780 --> 00:03:00.310
 all the artistic talent all the power 

00:02:58.180 --> 00:03:03.489
 and artistic that has bolivia I think 

00:03:00.310 --> 00:03:05.290
 that bolivia is not only a power 

00:03:03.489 --> 00:03:08.829
 culturally in what is exposed to the 

00:03:05.290 --> 00:03:10.180
 andean culture but that is a hotbed 

00:03:08.829 --> 00:03:12.579
 of artists in all their genres 

00:03:10.180 --> 00:03:15.099
 safe musicals that also have to 

00:03:12.579 --> 00:03:18.310
 be a kind of a cultural watercolor 

00:03:15.099 --> 00:03:19.780
 where can we find or be a space 

00:03:18.310 --> 00:03:24.730
 where you can share besides the 

00:03:19.780 --> 00:03:26.739
 music the dance food a model a 

00:03:24.730 --> 00:03:27.909
 architectural project and commitment 

00:03:26.739 --> 00:03:30.250
 to provide support to artists 

00:03:27.909 --> 00:03:32.199
 nationals in addition to the invitation 

00:03:30.250 --> 00:03:34.719
 open for international musicians 

00:03:32.199 --> 00:03:36.579
 to the municipality of tiquipaya that the 

00:03:34.719 --> 00:03:38.139
 wait with natural landscapes that already 

00:03:36.579 --> 00:03:40.419
 they were the delight of visitors 

00:03:38.139 --> 00:03:44.250
 foreigners in different summits and 

00:03:40.419 --> 00:03:44.250
