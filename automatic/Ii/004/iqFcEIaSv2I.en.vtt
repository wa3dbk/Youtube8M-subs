00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.119 

so<00:00:00.420> now<00:00:00.570> in<00:00:00.810> this<00:00:01.020> rhythm<00:00:01.560> changing<00:00:01.920> we<00:00:01.979> just

00:00:02.119 --> 00:00:02.129 
so now in this rhythm changing we just

00:00:02.129 --> 00:00:05.050 
so now in this rhythm changing we just
looked<00:00:02.280> at<00:00:02.370> the<00:00:02.460> first<00:00:02.610> time<00:00:02.879> this<00:00:03.030> 1625

00:00:05.050 --> 00:00:05.060 
looked at the first time this 1625

00:00:05.060 --> 00:00:20.769 
looked at the first time this 1625
there's<00:00:06.060> the<00:00:06.359> second<00:00:06.720> half<00:00:06.870> which<00:00:07.170> goes<00:00:15.949> dd7

00:00:20.769 --> 00:00:20.779 

00:00:20.779 --> 00:00:27.320 

g-d<00:00:21.949> hey<00:00:22.949> seven<00:00:23.369> whoa

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:27.330 

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:34.350 

and<00:00:30.180> before<00:00:31.180> I<00:00:31.360> talk<00:00:31.630> about<00:00:33.120> concepts<00:00:34.120> about

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:34.360 
and before I talk about concepts about

00:00:34.360 --> 00:00:36.840 
and before I talk about concepts about
how<00:00:34.630> this<00:00:34.840> works<00:00:35.200> I<00:00:35.560> might<00:00:36.280> as<00:00:36.370> well<00:00:36.520> just<00:00:36.670> show

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:36.850 
how this works I might as well just show

00:00:36.850 --> 00:00:38.070 
how this works I might as well just show
you<00:00:36.910> a<00:00:37.030> few<00:00:37.210> licks<00:00:37.450> because<00:00:37.750> it's<00:00:37.900> another

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:38.080 
you a few licks because it's another

00:00:38.080 --> 00:00:39.870 
you a few licks because it's another
common<00:00:38.440> progression<00:00:38.890> I<00:00:39.070> mean<00:00:39.430> we<00:00:39.520> saw<00:00:39.700> this

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:39.880 
common progression I mean we saw this

00:00:39.880 --> 00:00:48.660 
common progression I mean we saw this
already<00:00:44.070> major<00:00:45.070> to<00:00:45.340> minor<00:00:46.980> we<00:00:47.980> saw<00:00:48.190> this<00:00:48.400> and

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:48.670 
already major to minor we saw this and

00:00:48.670 --> 00:00:55.770 
already major to minor we saw this and
over<00:00:49.330> this<00:00:49.510> progression<00:00:54.600> the<00:00:55.600> only

00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:55.780 
over this progression the only

00:00:55.780 --> 00:00:58.369 
over this progression the only
difference<00:00:55.989> now<00:00:56.230> is<00:00:56.350> that<00:00:56.530> the<00:00:56.950> duration<00:00:57.670> is

00:00:58.369 --> 00:00:58.379 
difference now is that the duration is

00:00:58.379 --> 00:01:06.149 
difference now is that the duration is
cut<00:00:59.379> in<00:00:59.500> half<00:00:59.530> to<00:01:00.489> be<00:01:00.670> th<00:01:01.030> only<00:01:04.320> so<00:01:05.320> why<00:01:05.980> don't<00:01:06.130> I

00:01:06.149 --> 00:01:06.159 
cut in half to be th only so why don't I

00:01:06.159 --> 00:01:08.430 
cut in half to be th only so why don't I
show<00:01:06.190> you<00:01:06.370> a<00:01:06.460> few<00:01:06.730> lines<00:01:07.659> and<00:01:08.020> I'll<00:01:08.170> explain

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:08.440 
show you a few lines and I'll explain

00:01:08.440 --> 00:01:10.470 
show you a few lines and I'll explain
how<00:01:08.740> each<00:01:08.980> of<00:01:09.010> them<00:01:09.280> works<00:01:09.490> here's<00:01:10.150> the<00:01:10.270> first

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:10.480 
how each of them works here's the first

00:01:10.480 --> 00:01:22.380 
how each of them works here's the first
leg<00:01:15.780> again<00:01:20.729> and<00:01:21.729> it's<00:01:21.909> something<00:01:22.120> that<00:01:22.360> just

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:22.390 
leg again and it's something that just

00:01:22.390 --> 00:01:27.530 
leg again and it's something that just
based<00:01:22.780> off<00:01:22.960> a<00:01:23.020> D<00:01:23.320> major<00:01:23.530> chord<00:01:24.930> this<00:01:25.930> this<00:01:26.680> run

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:27.540 
based off a D major chord this this run

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:29.550 
based off a D major chord this this run
even<00:01:28.540> though<00:01:28.570> I'm<00:01:28.750> showing<00:01:29.020> it<00:01:29.140> to<00:01:29.260> you<00:01:29.380> for

00:01:29.550 --> 00:01:29.560 
even though I'm showing it to you for

00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:33.359 
even though I'm showing it to you for
this<00:01:29.890> progression<00:01:30.340> it<00:01:31.030> works<00:01:31.360> over<00:01:32.369> worked

00:01:33.359 --> 00:01:33.369 
this progression it works over worked

00:01:33.369 --> 00:01:36.780 
this progression it works over worked
over<00:01:33.579> them<00:01:34.469> or<00:01:35.469> just<00:01:35.530> a<00:01:35.890> plain<00:01:36.189> D<00:01:36.430> major<00:01:36.610> chord

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:36.790 
over them or just a plain D major chord

00:01:36.790 --> 00:01:38.789 
over them or just a plain D major chord
let's<00:01:37.750> try<00:01:37.869> with<00:01:38.079> the<00:01:38.140> rhythm<00:01:38.290> section<00:01:38.409> now

00:01:38.789 --> 00:01:38.799 
let's try with the rhythm section now

00:01:38.799 --> 00:01:48.859 
let's try with the rhythm section now
one<00:01:39.189> two<00:01:40.090> one<00:01:41.049> two<00:01:41.110> three<00:01:42.040> four

00:01:48.859 --> 00:01:48.869 

00:01:48.869 --> 00:01:51.330 

so<00:01:49.869> you<00:01:49.930> see<00:01:50.140> it's<00:01:50.259> completely<00:01:50.830> addition<00:01:51.250> it

00:01:51.330 --> 00:01:51.340 
so you see it's completely addition it

00:01:51.340 --> 00:01:54.270 
so you see it's completely addition it
has<00:01:51.369> no<00:01:51.850> it<00:01:52.630> has<00:01:52.750> no<00:01:53.020> respect<00:01:53.500> shame<00:01:53.740> on<00:01:53.920> it<00:01:54.070> for

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:54.280 
has no it has no respect shame on it for

00:01:54.280 --> 00:01:56.010 
has no it has no respect shame on it for
what<00:01:54.520> the<00:01:54.640> guy<00:01:54.790> the<00:01:55.060> rhythm<00:01:55.330> player<00:01:55.509> is<00:01:55.689> doing

00:01:56.010 --> 00:01:56.020 
what the guy the rhythm player is doing

00:01:56.020 --> 00:01:59.789 
what the guy the rhythm player is doing
but<00:01:56.920> again<00:01:57.040> it's<00:01:57.369> all<00:01:57.549> about<00:01:57.820> a<00:01:57.880> sense<00:01:58.210> of<00:01:58.799> it's

00:01:59.789 --> 00:01:59.799 
but again it's all about a sense of it's

00:01:59.799 --> 00:02:01.649 
but again it's all about a sense of it's
all<00:01:59.950> about<00:02:00.130> tension<00:02:00.580> and<00:02:00.700> release<00:02:00.909> me<00:02:00.970> at<00:02:01.540> the

00:02:01.649 --> 00:02:01.659 
all about tension and release me at the

00:02:01.659 --> 00:02:06.870 
all about tension and release me at the
end<00:02:01.780> we<00:02:01.960> resolve<00:02:02.289> the<00:02:05.430> resolution<00:02:06.430> that's

00:02:06.870 --> 00:02:06.880 
end we resolve the resolution that's

00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:13.080 
end we resolve the resolution that's
dissonance<00:02:07.390> is<00:02:07.509> here<00:02:10.410> one<00:02:11.410> two<00:02:11.980> one<00:02:12.489> two<00:02:12.550> three

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:13.090 
dissonance is here one two one two three

00:02:13.090 --> 00:02:21.750 
dissonance is here one two one two three
four<00:02:17.640> okay<00:02:19.680> let<00:02:20.680> me<00:02:20.769> just<00:02:20.800> slow<00:02:21.340> that<00:02:21.550> down<00:02:21.580> for

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:21.760 
four okay let me just slow that down for

00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:42.680 
four okay let me just slow that down for
you<00:02:30.120> even<00:02:31.120> slower<00:02:31.360> just<00:02:31.569> a<00:02:31.660> note

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:42.690 

00:02:42.690 --> 00:03:05.420 

just<00:02:43.690> the<00:02:43.780> notes<00:02:43.959> now

00:03:05.420 --> 00:03:05.430 

00:03:05.430 --> 00:03:22.410 

again<00:03:06.430> fast<00:03:09.569> use<00:03:10.569> a<00:03:10.599> variation<00:03:20.670> and<00:03:21.670> if<00:03:22.299> you

00:03:22.410 --> 00:03:22.420 
again fast use a variation and if you

00:03:22.420 --> 00:03:23.910 
again fast use a variation and if you
remember<00:03:22.750> from<00:03:22.780> the<00:03:23.019> first<00:03:23.049> DVD<00:03:23.560> instead<00:03:23.680> of

00:03:23.910 --> 00:03:23.920 
remember from the first DVD instead of

00:03:23.920 --> 00:03:26.160 
remember from the first DVD instead of
doing<00:03:24.129> this<00:03:24.310> this<00:03:24.760> kind<00:03:25.000> of<00:03:25.060> we<00:03:25.930> could<00:03:26.049> have

00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:26.170 
doing this this kind of we could have

00:03:26.170 --> 00:03:28.289 
doing this this kind of we could have
done<00:03:26.349> just<00:03:27.010> started<00:03:27.459> with<00:03:27.579> this<00:03:27.670> not<00:03:28.090> here

00:03:28.289 --> 00:03:28.299 
done just started with this not here

00:03:28.299 --> 00:03:32.699 
done just started with this not here
starting<00:03:29.290> with<00:03:29.349> an<00:03:29.470> upstroke<00:03:31.290> let's<00:03:32.290> try<00:03:32.439> both

00:03:32.699 --> 00:03:32.709 
starting with an upstroke let's try both

00:03:32.709 --> 00:03:35.970 
starting with an upstroke let's try both
and<00:03:32.889> let's<00:03:33.340> do<00:03:33.459> it<00:03:33.579> the<00:03:33.670> way<00:03:33.760> I<00:03:33.790> showed<00:03:34.030> you<00:03:34.980> I'm

00:03:35.970 --> 00:03:35.980 
and let's do it the way I showed you I'm

00:03:35.980 --> 00:03:39.000 
and let's do it the way I showed you I'm
sorry<00:03:36.189> and<00:03:36.849> another<00:03:37.150> way<00:03:37.359> let's<00:03:37.959> do<00:03:38.109> it<00:03:38.170> one

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:39.010 
sorry and another way let's do it one

00:03:39.010 --> 00:03:48.839 
sorry and another way let's do it one
two<00:03:39.849> one<00:03:40.689> two<00:03:40.750> three<00:03:41.650> four<00:03:47.310> let's<00:03:48.310> try<00:03:48.549> it<00:03:48.609> the

00:03:48.839 --> 00:03:48.849 
two one two three four let's try it the

00:03:48.849 --> 00:03:50.149 
two one two three four let's try it the
other<00:03:48.879> way<00:03:49.120> which<00:03:49.389> gives<00:03:49.659> a<00:03:49.810> little<00:03:49.959> more

00:03:50.149 --> 00:03:50.159 
other way which gives a little more

00:03:50.159 --> 00:03:53.610 
other way which gives a little more
character<00:03:51.159> to<00:03:51.489> the<00:03:51.700> phrasing<00:03:52.379> 12<00:03:53.379> in<00:03:53.500> this

00:03:53.610 --> 00:03:53.620 
character to the phrasing 12 in this

00:03:53.620 --> 00:03:55.409 
character to the phrasing 12 in this
time<00:03:53.829> and<00:03:53.980> we'd<00:03:54.069> start<00:03:54.370> we<00:03:54.879> talked<00:03:55.090> about<00:03:55.180> this

00:03:55.409 --> 00:03:55.419 
time and we'd start we talked about this

00:03:55.419 --> 00:03:57.000 
time and we'd start we talked about this
before<00:03:55.569> but<00:03:55.900> this<00:03:55.989> time<00:03:56.049> we<00:03:56.409> start<00:03:56.680> on<00:03:56.829> the

00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:57.010 
before but this time we start on the

00:03:57.010 --> 00:03:58.349 
before but this time we start on the
offbeat<00:03:57.400> whereas<00:03:57.639> the<00:03:57.760> other<00:03:57.790> one<00:03:58.060> started

00:03:58.349 --> 00:03:58.359 
offbeat whereas the other one started

00:03:58.359 --> 00:04:04.980 
offbeat whereas the other one started
straight<00:03:59.049> on<00:03:59.169> the<00:03:59.260> beat<00:03:59.439> 1<00:04:00.069> a<00:04:00.340> 2<00:04:00.730> and<00:04:01.569> 1<00:04:01.840> 2<00:04:02.230> 3<00:04:02.530> 4
