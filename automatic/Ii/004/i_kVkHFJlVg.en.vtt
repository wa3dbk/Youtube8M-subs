so<00:02:13.239> this<00:02:14.239> is<00:02:14.390> basically<00:02:14.690> what<00:02:15.440> the<00:02:15.470> game<00:02:15.709> does

00:02:15.729 --> 00:02:15.739 
so this is basically what the game does

00:02:15.739 --> 00:02:19.900 
so this is basically what the game does
it<00:02:16.340> alters<00:02:16.700> the<00:02:16.760> mechanics<00:02:17.269> of<00:02:17.360> your<00:02:18.579> of<00:02:19.579> items

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:19.910 
it alters the mechanics of your of items

00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:22.090 
it alters the mechanics of your of items
in<00:02:20.030> Minecraft<00:02:20.420> so<00:02:20.629> for<00:02:21.290> example<00:02:21.680> this<00:02:21.859> feather

00:02:22.090 --> 00:02:22.100 
in Minecraft so for example this feather

00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:23.710 
in Minecraft so for example this feather
will<00:02:22.340> give<00:02:22.489> me<00:02:22.579> a<00:02:22.639> ten<00:02:22.850> second<00:02:23.209> speed<00:02:23.480> boost

00:02:23.710 --> 00:02:23.720 
will give me a ten second speed boost

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:26.740 
will give me a ten second speed boost
but<00:02:24.260> you'll<00:02:24.380> notice<00:02:24.590> that<00:02:24.920> well<00:02:25.819> I'm<00:02:26.120> oh<00:02:26.450> yeah

00:02:26.740 --> 00:02:26.750 
but you'll notice that well I'm oh yeah

00:06:49.309 --> 00:06:49.319 
and I can use our queue to reload and

00:06:49.319 --> 00:06:52.790 
and I can use our queue to reload and
now<00:06:49.860> I<00:06:49.889> can<00:06:50.069> shoot<00:06:50.370> that<00:06:50.550> TNT<00:06:51.060> and<00:06:51.529> now<00:06:52.529> it'll

00:06:52.790 --> 00:06:52.800 
now I can shoot that TNT and now it'll

00:06:52.800 --> 00:06:56.240 
now I can shoot that TNT and now it'll
cause<00:06:52.919> block<00:06:53.219> damage<00:06:53.550> so<00:06:54.650> the<00:06:55.650> last<00:06:55.830> thing<00:06:56.069> is

00:06:56.240 --> 00:06:56.250 
cause block damage so the last thing is

00:06:56.250 --> 00:06:58.999 
cause block damage so the last thing is
a<00:06:56.849> bow<00:06:57.270> that<00:06:57.900> basically<00:06:58.289> does<00:06:58.529> the<00:06:58.560> same<00:06:58.650> thing

00:06:58.999 --> 00:06:59.009 
a bow that basically does the same thing

00:06:59.009 --> 00:07:02.329 
a bow that basically does the same thing
as<00:06:59.219> the<00:06:59.460> TNT<00:06:59.900> I<00:07:00.900> might<00:07:01.469> change<00:07:01.710> the<00:07:01.919> mechanics

00:07:02.329 --> 00:07:02.339 
as the TNT I might change the mechanics

00:07:02.339 --> 00:07:04.249 
as the TNT I might change the mechanics
of<00:07:02.430> this<00:07:02.580> though<00:07:02.819> because<00:07:03.360> you<00:07:03.719> cannot<00:07:03.960> dot

00:07:04.249 --> 00:07:04.259 
of this though because you cannot dot

00:07:04.259 --> 00:07:07.339 
of this though because you cannot dot
