00:00:41.650 --> 00:00:41.660 

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:50.400 

sides<00:00:44.090> here's<00:00:45.090> how<00:00:45.360> the<00:00:45.860> top<00:00:46.860> looks

00:00:50.400 --> 00:00:50.410 

00:00:50.410 --> 00:00:57.430 

we<00:00:51.410> are<00:00:51.470> using<00:00:54.160> dr.<00:00:55.160> pepper<00:00:56.020> plastic<00:00:57.020> model

00:00:57.430 --> 00:00:57.440 
we are using dr. pepper plastic model

00:00:57.440 --> 00:01:01.930 
we are using dr. pepper plastic model
and<00:00:57.710> it<00:00:58.640> accepts<00:00:59.300> a<00:00:59.510> Pritchard<00:01:00.110> nipple<00:01:00.940> this

00:01:01.930 --> 00:01:01.940 
and it accepts a Pritchard nipple this

00:01:01.940 --> 00:01:05.049 
and it accepts a Pritchard nipple this
does<00:01:02.780> not<00:01:03.020> fit<00:01:03.320> exactly<00:01:03.470> in<00:01:04.309> the<00:01:04.550> slots<00:01:04.850> that

00:01:05.049 --> 00:01:05.059 
does not fit exactly in the slots that

00:01:05.059 --> 00:01:07.060 
does not fit exactly in the slots that
the<00:01:05.540> person<00:01:05.870> made<00:01:06.050> they<00:01:06.320> had<00:01:06.530> a<00:01:06.560> different

00:01:07.060 --> 00:01:07.070 
the person made they had a different

the person made they had a different
kind<00:01:07.190> of<00:01:07.310> a<00:01:07.460> plastic<00:01:08.270> bottle<00:01:08.479> we<00:01:08.720> used<00:01:08.930> at<00:01:09.080> that

00:01:09.130 --> 00:01:09.140 
kind of a plastic bottle we used at that

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:13.360 
kind of a plastic bottle we used at that
time<00:01:09.260> so<00:01:09.830> you<00:01:10.580> would<00:01:10.729> need<00:01:10.910> to<00:01:11.150> make<00:01:12.370> these

00:01:13.360 --> 00:01:13.370 
time so you would need to make these

00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:15.490 
time so you would need to make these
slots<00:01:13.820> according<00:01:14.720> to<00:01:14.810> what<00:01:14.960> kind<00:01:15.140> of<00:01:15.170> bottle

00:01:15.490 --> 00:01:15.500 
slots according to what kind of bottle

00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:17.830 
slots according to what kind of bottle
you're<00:01:15.650> going<00:01:15.680> to<00:01:15.860> be<00:01:16.010> even<00:01:16.310> here<00:01:16.700> for<00:01:17.660> the

00:01:17.830 --> 00:01:17.840 
you're going to be even here for the

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:22.060 
you're going to be even here for the
this<00:01:18.229> one<00:01:18.470> there<00:01:19.160> was<00:01:19.400> a<00:01:20.200> 2x4<00:01:21.200> they<00:01:21.860> went

00:01:22.060 --> 00:01:22.070 
this one there was a 2x4 they went

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:25.240 
this one there was a 2x4 they went
across<00:01:22.280> this<00:01:22.610> and<00:01:22.820> that<00:01:22.960> kept<00:01:23.960> these<00:01:24.770> bottles

00:01:25.240 --> 00:01:25.250 
across this and that kept these bottles

00:01:25.250 --> 00:01:27.700 
across this and that kept these bottles
from<00:01:25.400> being<00:01:25.670> pushed<00:01:25.910> upwards<00:01:26.420> you<00:01:27.380> can<00:01:27.470> see<00:01:27.590> on

00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:27.710 
from being pushed upwards you can see on

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:34.420 
from being pushed upwards you can see on
this<00:01:29.110> these<00:01:30.110> bottles<00:01:31.390> move<00:01:32.390> around<00:01:33.100> if<00:01:34.100> I<00:01:34.250> was

00:01:34.420 --> 00:01:34.430 
this these bottles move around if I was

00:01:34.430 --> 00:01:37.630 
this these bottles move around if I was
doing<00:01:34.759> it<00:01:34.940> I<00:01:35.180> would<00:01:35.960> have<00:01:36.170> something<00:01:36.470> to<00:01:36.649> lay

00:01:37.630 --> 00:01:37.640 
doing it I would have something to lay

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:39.969 
doing it I would have something to lay
down<00:01:37.910> on<00:01:38.270> this<00:01:38.570> to<00:01:38.720> hold<00:01:38.930> these<00:01:39.140> in<00:01:39.200> place<00:01:39.680> so

00:01:39.969 --> 00:01:39.979 
down on this to hold these in place so

00:01:39.979 --> 00:01:42.820 
down on this to hold these in place so
that<00:01:40.009> they<00:01:40.310> don't<00:01:40.910> flop<00:01:41.300> around<00:01:41.590> and<00:01:42.590> show<00:01:42.770> you

00:01:42.820 --> 00:01:42.830 
that they don't flop around and show you

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:49.870 
that they don't flop around and show you
what<00:01:43.100> the<00:01:43.250> back<00:01:43.940> of<00:01:44.149> it<00:01:44.270> looks<00:01:44.300> like<00:01:48.009> and<00:01:49.009> it's

00:01:49.870 --> 00:01:49.880 
what the back of it looks like and it's

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:57.340 
what the back of it looks like and it's
just<00:01:49.970> one<00:01:51.399> board<00:01:53.590> goes<00:01:54.590> across<00:01:54.979> that<00:01:56.350> the

00:01:57.340 --> 00:01:57.350 
just one board goes across that the

00:01:57.350 --> 00:01:59.500 
just one board goes across that the
other<00:01:57.470> thing<00:01:57.740> I<00:01:57.890> would<00:01:57.950> do<00:01:58.280> that<00:01:58.940> was<00:01:59.090> not<00:01:59.270> done

00:01:59.500 --> 00:01:59.510 
other thing I would do that was not done

00:01:59.510 --> 00:02:04.660 
other thing I would do that was not done
here<00:01:59.960> I<00:02:00.970> would<00:02:01.970> take<00:02:02.210> and<00:02:03.049> take<00:02:03.799> a<00:02:03.860> board

00:02:04.660 --> 00:02:04.670 
here I would take and take a board

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:07.719 
here I would take and take a board
across<00:02:04.820> this<00:02:05.330> feather<00:02:05.659> to<00:02:06.650> keep<00:02:06.860> them<00:02:07.159> from

00:02:07.719 --> 00:02:07.729 
across this feather to keep them from

00:02:07.729 --> 00:02:09.759 
across this feather to keep them from
being<00:02:07.940> able<00:02:08.119> to<00:02:08.269> move<00:02:08.780> this<00:02:08.929> around<00:02:09.140> so<00:02:09.530> easy

00:02:09.759 --> 00:02:09.769 
being able to move this around so easy

00:02:09.769 --> 00:02:12.130 
being able to move this around so easy
it<00:02:09.979> needs<00:02:10.190> more<00:02:10.459> stability<00:02:10.820> on<00:02:11.330> that<00:02:11.720> bottom

00:02:12.130 --> 00:02:12.140 
it needs more stability on that bottom

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:16.060 
it needs more stability on that bottom
but<00:02:13.070> this<00:02:13.220> is<00:02:13.430> fairly<00:02:13.640> easy<00:02:13.820> to<00:02:14.630> make<00:02:15.290> if<00:02:15.680> you

00:02:16.060 --> 00:02:16.070 
but this is fairly easy to make if you

00:02:16.070 --> 00:02:18.880 
but this is fairly easy to make if you
do<00:02:16.480> woodworking<00:02:17.480> type<00:02:17.989> of<00:02:18.200> stuff<00:02:18.500> which<00:02:18.739> I

00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:18.890 
do woodworking type of stuff which I

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:22.240 
do woodworking type of stuff which I
don't<00:02:19.130> do<00:02:19.340> and<00:02:20.019> it's<00:02:21.019> very<00:02:21.290> nice<00:02:21.530> this<00:02:21.890> one<00:02:22.070> has

00:02:22.240 --> 00:02:22.250 
don't do and it's very nice this one has

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:27.070 
don't do and it's very nice this one has
six<00:02:22.549> slots<00:02:23.000> and<00:02:24.519> when<00:02:25.519> we<00:02:25.700> need<00:02:25.910> it<00:02:25.940> it's<00:02:26.810> very

00:02:27.070 --> 00:02:27.080 
six slots and when we need it it's very

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:29.050 
six slots and when we need it it's very
handy<00:02:27.500> instead<00:02:27.860> of<00:02:27.950> trying<00:02:28.160> to<00:02:28.220> do<00:02:28.400> each<00:02:28.790> of

00:02:29.050 --> 00:02:29.060 
handy instead of trying to do each of

00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:34.299 
handy instead of trying to do each of
the<00:02:29.239> kids<00:02:29.480> separately<00:02:30.730> hope<00:02:31.730> this<00:02:31.910> helps
