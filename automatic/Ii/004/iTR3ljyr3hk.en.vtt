00:05:12.210 --> 00:05:13.879 
good what I've done but I've done
individual<00:05:12.810> ones<00:05:12.960> so<00:05:13.229> as<00:05:13.319> you<00:05:13.439> can<00:05:13.500> see<00:05:13.560> like

00:05:13.879 --> 00:05:13.889 
individual ones so as you can see like

00:05:13.889 --> 00:05:16.010 
individual ones so as you can see like
I've<00:05:14.580> told<00:05:14.789> the<00:05:14.939> team's<00:05:15.120> very<00:05:15.270> short<00:05:15.569> passing

00:05:16.010 --> 00:05:16.020 
I've told the team's very short passing

00:05:16.020 --> 00:05:17.839 
I've told the team's very short passing
but<00:05:16.349> realistically<00:05:16.919> no<00:05:17.279> player<00:05:17.610> on<00:05:17.699> my<00:05:17.729> team

00:05:17.839 --> 00:05:17.849 
but realistically no player on my team

00:05:17.849 --> 00:05:21.860 
but realistically no player on my team
for<00:05:18.360> example<00:05:18.889> let's<00:05:19.889> go<00:05:19.979> to<00:05:20.629> calling<00:05:21.629> home

00:05:21.860 --> 00:05:21.870 
for example let's go to calling home

00:05:21.870 --> 00:05:24.499 
for example let's go to calling home
jinx<00:05:22.259> I've<00:05:22.439> told<00:05:22.710> him<00:05:22.860> playing<00:05:23.099> mixed<00:05:23.460> so<00:05:24.360> that

00:05:24.499 --> 00:05:24.509 
jinx I've told him playing mixed so that

00:05:24.509 --> 00:05:25.999 
jinx I've told him playing mixed so that
it's<00:05:24.659> not<00:05:24.810> really<00:05:25.050> gonna<00:05:25.169> affect<00:05:25.319> individual

00:05:25.999 --> 00:05:26.009 
it's not really gonna affect individual

00:05:26.009 --> 00:05:27.439 
it's not really gonna affect individual
is<00:05:26.129> where<00:05:26.310> it<00:05:26.400> is<00:05:26.520> at<00:05:26.699> the<00:05:26.759> moment<00:05:26.879> the<00:05:27.389> only

00:05:27.439 --> 00:05:27.449 
is where it is at the moment the only

00:05:27.449 --> 00:05:28.519 
is where it is at the moment the only
thing<00:05:27.569> that's<00:05:27.779> really<00:05:27.870> gonna<00:05:28.020> affect<00:05:28.199> the

00:05:28.519 --> 00:05:28.529 
thing that's really gonna affect the

00:05:28.529 --> 00:05:29.809 
thing that's really gonna affect the
team<00:05:28.650> will<00:05:28.860> be<00:05:28.949> these<00:05:29.129> attractions<00:05:29.550> here

00:05:29.809 --> 00:05:29.819 
team will be these attractions here

00:05:29.819 --> 00:05:31.760 
team will be these attractions here
which<00:05:30.449> looking<00:05:30.719> for<00:05:30.870> defensive<00:05:31.259> line<00:05:31.409> normal

00:05:31.760 --> 00:05:31.770 
which looking for defensive line normal

00:05:31.770 --> 00:05:34.219 
which looking for defensive line normal
with<00:05:31.979> normal<00:05:32.400> and<00:05:32.580> tempo<00:05:32.879> quick<00:05:33.229> so

00:05:34.219 --> 00:05:34.229 
with normal and tempo quick so

00:05:34.229 --> 00:05:35.450 
with normal and tempo quick so
everything<00:05:34.500> else<00:05:34.620> is<00:05:34.740> basically<00:05:35.039> relative

00:05:35.450 --> 00:05:35.460 
everything else is basically relative

00:05:35.460 --> 00:05:36.920 
everything else is basically relative
and<00:05:35.789> it's<00:05:35.969> gonna<00:05:36.089> just<00:05:36.479> go<00:05:36.599> individually

00:05:36.920 --> 00:05:36.930 
and it's gonna just go individually

00:05:36.930 --> 00:05:39.740 
and it's gonna just go individually
individual<00:05:37.650> interruptions<00:05:38.069> basically<00:05:38.750> but

00:05:39.740 --> 00:05:39.750 
individual interruptions basically but

00:05:39.750 --> 00:05:42.679 
individual interruptions basically but

I<00:05:53.909> live<00:05:54.750> in<00:05:54.870> a<00:05:54.990> team<00:05:55.139> who<00:05:55.289> goes<00:05:55.439> down<00:05:55.469> from

00:05:55.939 --> 00:05:55.949 
I live in a team who goes down from

00:05:55.949 --> 00:05:57.230 
I live in a team who goes down from
friendships<00:05:56.310> that<00:05:56.430> team<00:05:56.639> goes<00:05:56.819> straight<00:05:57.089> into

00:05:57.230 --> 00:05:57.240 
friendships that team goes straight into

00:05:57.240 --> 00:05:59.899 
friendships that team goes straight into
the<00:05:57.419> playoff<00:05:57.659> against<00:05:57.930> you<00:05:58.789> don't<00:05:59.789> we

00:05:59.899 --> 00:05:59.909 
the playoff against you don't we

00:05:59.909 --> 00:06:01.189 
the playoff against you don't we
understand<00:06:00.240> they're<00:06:00.389> necessary<00:06:00.719> expand<00:06:00.990> the

00:06:01.189 --> 00:06:01.199 
understand they're necessary expand the

00:06:01.199 --> 00:06:02.300 
understand they're necessary expand the
league<00:06:01.349> but<00:06:01.529> I<00:06:01.620> suppose<00:06:01.800> would<00:06:01.949> get<00:06:02.069> to<00:06:02.189> know

00:06:02.300 --> 00:06:02.310 
league but I suppose would get to know

00:06:02.310 --> 00:06:05.679 
league but I suppose would get to know
it<00:06:02.460> as<00:06:02.580> we<00:06:02.729> go<00:06:02.819> along<00:06:03.080> so<00:06:04.080> that<00:06:04.379> will<00:06:04.710> be<00:06:04.830> cool

00:06:05.679 --> 00:06:05.689 
it as we go along so that will be cool

00:06:05.689 --> 00:06:07.909 
it as we go along so that will be cool
as<00:06:06.689> I<00:06:06.750> said<00:06:06.930> though<00:06:07.050> we're<00:06:07.199> gonna<00:06:07.289> take<00:06:07.560> as<00:06:07.770> it

00:06:07.909 --> 00:06:07.919 
as I said though we're gonna take as it

00:06:07.919 --> 00:06:10.129 
as I said though we're gonna take as it
goes<00:06:08.069> like<00:06:08.699> obviously<00:06:09.000> try<00:06:09.810> and<00:06:09.930> get<00:06:10.020> them

00:06:10.129 --> 00:06:10.139 
goes like obviously try and get them
