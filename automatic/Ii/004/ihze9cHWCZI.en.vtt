00:00:03.200 --> 00:00:09.809
 andrÃ© guy we're inside a 

00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:11.719
 difficult year with little water there the 

00:00:09.809 --> 00:00:14.700
 rosebushes are beautiful very flowery 

00:00:11.719 --> 00:00:16.440
 how does it resist drought? 

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:16.949
 how are they going to resist the 

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:19.260
 drought 

00:00:16.949 --> 00:00:20.550
 and how are we going to help them 

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:22.980
 resist drought 

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:24.359
 so if you plant the most derogate 

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:26.849
 currently employs it's going to have to 

00:00:24.359 --> 00:00:28.439
 water and practically departure times by 

00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:31.850
 week once a week 

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:34.220
 currently yes because the 

00:00:31.850 --> 00:00:37.700
 the rose bush before its roots plunge 

00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:40.640
 in the soil actually goes the rest and that's 

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:43.160
 stayed in the mound and it's this fashion 

00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:45.320
 dries faster than the ground at 

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:48.320
 turn so he'll have to really take 

00:00:45.320 --> 00:00:51.379
 departure care and that's why 

00:00:48.320 --> 00:00:53.180
 we really got to people who have 

00:00:51.379 --> 00:00:55.820
 country houses that are not going 

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:58.570
 very often in their house to plant 

00:00:55.820 --> 00:01:01.640
 earlier in the fall like this and 

00:00:58.570 --> 00:01:02.960
 the most winter watering goes on 

00:01:01.640 --> 00:01:06.710
 and the rose bushes can get by 

00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:08.990
 no problem next spring how 

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:14.180
 do we see that a rose tree is starting to fail 

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:19.010
 of water we notice that a rose bush is missing 

00:01:14.180 --> 00:01:22.580
 water first by the ends 

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:25.040
 it's a bit like we're cold 

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:26.360
 the fingers vinify them and well for 

00:01:25.040 --> 00:01:30.890
 the hÃ©rault is the same peduncles 

00:01:26.360 --> 00:01:34.430
 begins to bend and there must be 

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:37.610
 also intervene the foliage yellows 

00:01:34.430 --> 00:01:40.100
 the jo ni evenly so that's the 

00:01:37.610 --> 00:01:41.799
 distinguishes from other diseases or other 

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:44.329
 symptoms 

00:01:41.799 --> 00:01:45.920
 it's pretty characteristic is there there 

00:01:44.329 --> 00:01:48.560
 have to water it abundantly 

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:51.290
 what are your tips for 

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:53.119
 in view of a future drought how 

00:01:51.290 --> 00:01:55.610
 can we act today to limit 

00:01:53.119 --> 00:01:57.560
 watering and make sure that our 

00:01:55.610 --> 00:02:00.200
 rosie suffer less from lack of water 

00:01:57.560 --> 00:02:02.509
 so first of all first years of life 

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:04.939
 of the rosebush the first two years there 

00:02:02.509 --> 00:02:07.690
 must water from passes happened from that 

00:02:04.939 --> 00:02:11.060
 after we do not have to do it 

00:02:07.690 --> 00:02:13.670
 but if we do not do we will have less 

00:02:11.060 --> 00:02:16.310
 flowers in the fall and we will especially - 

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:18.319
 new stems that will go so 

00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:20.900
 for me watered it is essential 

00:02:18.319 --> 00:02:23.060
 then to limit watering it is worth 

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:25.489
 better water once a week 

00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:27.860
 to force the roots to dive in 

00:02:25.489 --> 00:02:31.370
 depth every bottle and then 

00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:32.660
 also put a basket that will evoke 

00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:36.050
 t d 

00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:39.370
 d operations and therefore allow to 

00:02:36.050 --> 00:02:39.370
 limit watering
