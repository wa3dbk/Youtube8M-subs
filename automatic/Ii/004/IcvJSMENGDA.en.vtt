that rounds up the zombie aspect from
there<00:01:55.179> we<00:01:55.359> are<00:01:55.479> playing<00:01:55.749> to<00:01:56.350> math<00:01:56.799> chameleons

00:01:57.449 --> 00:01:57.459 
there we are playing to math chameleons

00:01:57.459 --> 00:02:01.020 
there we are playing to math chameleons
and<00:01:57.759> three<00:01:58.359> copies<00:01:58.569> of<00:01:58.950> kagetokage<00:01:59.950> a<00:02:00.369> mass

and three copies of kagetokage a mass

00:02:01.030 --> 00:02:02.789 
and three copies of kagetokage a mass
chameleon<00:02:01.450> is<00:02:01.569> a<00:02:01.600> really<00:02:02.049> cool<00:02:02.200> card<00:02:02.469> it<00:02:02.619> kind

00:02:02.789 --> 00:02:02.799 
chameleon is a really cool card it kind

00:02:02.799 --> 00:02:04.410 
chameleon is a really cool card it kind
of<00:02:02.829> works<00:02:03.009> the<00:02:03.130> same<00:02:03.280> way<00:02:03.490> as<00:02:03.670> go-go-go<00:02:04.389> giant

00:02:04.410 --> 00:02:04.420 
of works the same way as go-go-go giant
