so I will explain you and we go we will
go<00:00:24.520> through<00:00:26.669> different<00:00:27.669> parts<00:00:27.849> from<00:00:28.779> the

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:29.680 
go through different parts from the

00:00:29.680 --> 00:00:32.970 
go through different parts from the
cockpit<00:00:29.950> of<00:00:30.189> the<00:00:30.250> car<00:00:30.360> first<00:00:31.360> thing<00:00:31.599> and<00:00:31.980> the

00:00:32.970 --> 00:00:32.980 
cockpit of the car first thing and the

00:00:32.980 --> 00:00:36.209 
cockpit of the car first thing and the
most<00:00:33.100> important<00:00:33.670> is<00:00:33.820> a<00:00:33.850> safety<00:00:34.510> you<00:00:34.719> know<00:00:35.219> the

00:00:36.209 --> 00:00:36.219 
most important is a safety you know the

00:00:36.219 --> 00:00:38.790 
most important is a safety you know the
difference<00:00:36.550> between<00:00:36.609> the<00:00:37.079> road<00:00:38.079> car<00:00:38.320> and<00:00:38.559> a

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:38.800 
difference between the road car and a

00:00:38.800 --> 00:00:41.250 
difference between the road car and a
racing<00:00:39.219> car<00:00:39.399> is<00:00:39.579> that<00:00:39.640> the<00:00:40.120> seatbelt<00:00:40.539> we<00:00:40.899> have

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:41.260 
racing car is that the seatbelt we have

00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:44.549 
racing car is that the seatbelt we have
it<00:00:41.410> from<00:00:41.890> six<00:00:42.249> points<00:00:42.780> six<00:00:43.780> points<00:00:44.140> means<00:00:44.320> that

00:00:44.549 --> 00:00:44.559 
it from six points six points means that

00:00:44.559 --> 00:00:46.229 
it from six points six points means that
we<00:00:44.949> have<00:00:45.100> two<00:00:45.550> on<00:00:45.760> the<00:00:45.879> legs

00:00:46.229 --> 00:00:46.239 
we have two on the legs

00:00:46.239 --> 00:00:48.479 
we have two on the legs
-<00:00:46.899> on<00:00:47.050> the<00:00:47.140> hips<00:00:47.350> and<00:00:47.530> two<00:00:47.949> coming<00:00:48.249> from<00:00:48.370> the

00:00:48.479 --> 00:00:48.489 
- on the hips and two coming from the

00:00:48.489 --> 00:00:52.049 
- on the hips and two coming from the
shoulders<00:00:50.219> with<00:00:51.219> this<00:00:51.399> we<00:00:51.609> have<00:00:51.789> full

00:00:52.049 --> 00:00:52.059 
shoulders with this we have full

00:00:52.059 --> 00:00:54.389 
shoulders with this we have full
protection<00:00:52.379> just<00:00:53.379> in<00:00:53.559> case<00:00:53.739> in<00:00:53.920> an<00:00:54.039> impact

00:00:54.389 --> 00:00:54.399 
protection just in case in an impact

00:00:54.399 --> 00:00:57.930 
protection just in case in an impact
from<00:00:55.390> sides<00:00:55.719> and<00:00:56.050> front<00:00:56.440> for<00:00:57.190> the<00:00:57.280> side<00:00:57.489> side

00:00:57.930 --> 00:00:57.940 
from sides and front for the side side

00:00:57.940 --> 00:01:02.660 
from sides and front for the side side
the<00:00:58.179> impact<00:00:58.690> also<00:00:58.960> we<00:00:59.409> have<00:00:59.640> this<00:01:00.640> fishnet

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:02.670 
the impact also we have this fishnet

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:05.670 
the impact also we have this fishnet
which<00:01:03.670> is<00:01:03.909> it<00:01:04.390> doesn't<00:01:04.720> really<00:01:05.110> look<00:01:05.320> too<00:01:05.379> much

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:05.680 
which is it doesn't really look too much

00:01:05.680 --> 00:01:08.970 
which is it doesn't really look too much
but<00:01:05.920> it's<00:01:06.100> very<00:01:06.190> important<00:01:06.729> because<00:01:07.830> when<00:01:08.830> we

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:08.980 
but it's very important because when we

00:01:08.980 --> 00:01:11.160 
but it's very important because when we
get<00:01:09.100> hit<00:01:09.340> from<00:01:09.610> the<00:01:09.910> size<00:01:10.090> we<00:01:10.360> normally<00:01:10.930> tend

00:01:11.160 --> 00:01:11.170 
get hit from the size we normally tend

00:01:11.170 --> 00:01:12.960 
get hit from the size we normally tend
to<00:01:11.350> you<00:01:12.130> know<00:01:12.160> lose<00:01:12.460> the<00:01:12.640> hand

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:12.970 
to you know lose the hand

00:01:12.970 --> 00:01:15.870 
to you know lose the hand
so<00:01:13.480> this<00:01:13.690> protect<00:01:14.110> us<00:01:14.260> to<00:01:14.470> keep<00:01:14.650> ourselves<00:01:15.100> in

00:01:15.870 --> 00:01:15.880 
so this protect us to keep ourselves in

00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:19.080 
so this protect us to keep ourselves in
in<00:01:16.540> the<00:01:16.720> in<00:01:16.990> the<00:01:17.110> safety<00:01:17.320> area<00:01:17.680> on<00:01:18.070> the<00:01:18.580> car<00:01:18.760> and

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:19.090 
in the in the safety area on the car and

00:01:19.090 --> 00:01:23.190 
in the in the safety area on the car and
then<00:01:19.690> of<00:01:19.900> course<00:01:19.960> we<00:01:20.290> have<00:01:20.470> a<00:01:21.120> the<00:01:22.120> the<00:01:23.020> door

00:01:23.190 --> 00:01:23.200 
then of course we have a the the door

00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:25.940 
then of course we have a the the door
that<00:01:23.410> also<00:01:23.800> opens<00:01:24.130> really<00:01:24.670> really<00:01:25.150> quickly

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:25.950 
that also opens really really quickly

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:30.330 
that also opens really really quickly
also<00:01:26.950> for<00:01:27.280> the<00:01:27.400> safety<00:01:28.260> we<00:01:29.260> have<00:01:29.440> a<00:01:29.470> cooling

00:01:30.330 --> 00:01:30.340 
also for the safety we have a cooling

00:01:30.340 --> 00:01:34.830 
also for the safety we have a cooling
system<00:01:30.520> which<00:01:31.240> because<00:01:31.630> one<00:01:31.930> of<00:01:31.960> the<00:01:33.840> most

00:01:34.830 --> 00:01:34.840 
system which because one of the most

00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:37.380 
system which because one of the most
common<00:01:35.370> problem<00:01:36.370> that<00:01:36.400> we<00:01:36.700> have<00:01:36.910> during<00:01:37.270> the

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:37.390 
common problem that we have during the

00:01:37.390 --> 00:01:39.690 
common problem that we have during the
race<00:01:37.510> is<00:01:37.810> the<00:01:37.960> heat<00:01:38.170> that<00:01:38.590> we<00:01:38.860> get<00:01:39.070> from<00:01:39.580> the

00:01:39.690 --> 00:01:39.700 
race is the heat that we get from the

00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:43.350 
race is the heat that we get from the
car<00:01:40.290> normally<00:01:41.290> gets<00:01:41.680> 250<00:01:42.340> maybe<00:01:42.640> could<00:01:42.880> be<00:01:42.910> 60

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:43.360 
car normally gets 250 maybe could be 60

00:01:43.360 --> 00:01:45.960 
car normally gets 250 maybe could be 60
depending<00:01:43.750> on<00:01:43.900> animals<00:01:44.470> here<00:01:44.650> but<00:01:45.610> it's<00:01:45.760> very

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:45.970 
depending on animals here but it's very

00:01:45.970 --> 00:01:48.090 
depending on animals here but it's very
hot<00:01:46.240> so<00:01:46.480> it's<00:01:46.990> very<00:01:47.080> important<00:01:47.560> to<00:01:47.650> us<00:01:47.770> to<00:01:47.950> keep

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:48.100 
hot so it's very important to us to keep

00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:53.040 
hot so it's very important to us to keep
our<00:01:48.670> body<00:01:49.710> cold<00:01:50.710> and<00:01:51.700> you<00:01:52.480> know<00:01:52.570> that's<00:01:52.840> much

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:53.050 
our body cold and you know that's much

00:01:53.050 --> 00:01:55.200 
our body cold and you know that's much
easier<00:01:53.440> for<00:01:53.650> ourselves<00:01:54.130> to<00:01:54.640> man<00:01:54.790> as<00:01:54.910> the<00:01:55.030> race

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:55.210 
easier for ourselves to man as the race

00:01:55.210 --> 00:01:58.320 
easier for ourselves to man as the race
so<00:01:56.110> we<00:01:56.380> got<00:01:56.620> a<00:01:56.980> boat<00:01:57.220> on<00:01:57.400> in<00:01:57.490> the<00:01:57.580> city<00:01:57.790> which<00:01:58.120> we

00:01:58.320 --> 00:01:58.330 
so we got a boat on in the city which we

00:01:58.330 --> 00:02:00.870 
so we got a boat on in the city which we
put<00:01:58.540> it<00:01:58.690> on<00:01:58.810> and<00:01:59.050> then<00:01:59.260> we<00:01:59.290> get<00:01:59.680> air<00:01:59.920> from<00:02:00.280> from

00:02:00.870 --> 00:02:00.880 
put it on and then we get air from from

00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:03.090 
put it on and then we get air from from
the<00:02:01.030> back<00:02:01.180> and<00:02:01.870> also<00:02:02.050> there<00:02:02.530> is<00:02:02.620> one<00:02:02.860> pipe

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:03.100 
the back and also there is one pipe

00:02:03.100 --> 00:02:06.780 
the back and also there is one pipe
coming<00:02:03.400> from<00:02:03.670> ups<00:02:04.980> which<00:02:05.980> goes<00:02:06.220> in<00:02:06.400> the<00:02:06.490> helmet

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:06.790 
coming from ups which goes in the helmet

00:02:06.790 --> 00:02:12.920 
coming from ups which goes in the helmet
so<00:02:06.970> for<00:02:07.600> for<00:02:07.840> us<00:02:07.960> is<00:02:08.819> quite<00:02:09.819> useful<00:02:11.640> system

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:12.930 
so for for us is quite useful system

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:15.660 
so for for us is quite useful system
also<00:02:13.930> what<00:02:14.109> we<00:02:14.230> have<00:02:14.379> in<00:02:14.499> the<00:02:14.560> car<00:02:14.739> which<00:02:15.640> is

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:15.670 
also what we have in the car which is

00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:17.640 
also what we have in the car which is
quite<00:02:16.329> important<00:02:16.780> is<00:02:16.900> the<00:02:17.019> main<00:02:17.200> part<00:02:17.379> in<00:02:17.590> the

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:17.650 
quite important is the main part in the

00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:19.110 
quite important is the main part in the
main

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:19.120 
main

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:23.009 
main
from<00:02:19.780> here<00:02:20.019> we<00:02:20.200> will<00:02:20.230> control<00:02:20.829> the<00:02:21.750> the<00:02:22.750> power

00:02:23.009 --> 00:02:23.019 
from here we will control the the power

00:02:23.019 --> 00:02:24.869 
from here we will control the the power
of<00:02:23.170> the<00:02:23.409> car<00:02:23.560> of<00:02:23.680> course<00:02:23.709> but<00:02:24.189> we<00:02:24.400> also<00:02:24.549> have

00:02:24.869 --> 00:02:24.879 
of the car of course but we also have

00:02:24.879 --> 00:02:27.839

during<00:03:38.530> the<00:03:39.299> the<00:03:40.299> run<00:03:40.510> but<00:03:40.780> we<00:03:41.560> use<00:03:41.769> it

00:03:41.789 --> 00:03:41.799 
during the the run but we use it

00:03:41.799 --> 00:03:43.979 
during the the run but we use it
especially<00:03:42.040> for<00:03:42.579> the<00:03:42.729> start<00:03:43.030> and<00:03:43.419> normally

00:03:51.780 --> 00:03:51.790 
you can put first gear and the car tends

00:03:51.790 --> 00:03:54.030 
you can put first gear and the car tends
to<00:03:52.000> move<00:03:52.120> so<00:03:52.629> it's<00:03:53.199> very<00:03:53.319> important<00:03:53.799> to<00:03:53.889> us<00:03:54.010> to

00:03:54.030 --> 00:03:54.040 
to move so it's very important to us to

00:03:54.040 --> 00:03:58.080 
to move so it's very important to us to
have<00:03:54.280> a<00:03:54.340> handbrake<00:03:54.790> to<00:03:55.030> keep<00:03:55.239> the<00:03:55.359> car<00:03:57.090> stop

and avoid any penalty gearbox shift
which<00:04:02.620> is<00:04:02.829> a<00:04:02.859> normal<00:04:03.220> and<00:04:03.549> is<00:04:04.269> sequential<00:04:04.689> then

00:04:05.250 --> 00:04:05.260 
which is a normal and is sequential then

00:04:05.260 --> 00:04:07.949 
which is a normal and is sequential then

00:04:14.909 --> 00:04:14.919 
imperative of the engines so view is

00:04:14.919 --> 00:04:16.770 
imperative of the engines so view is
very<00:04:15.040> important<00:04:15.579> -<00:04:15.729> also<00:04:16.030> of<00:04:16.299> course<00:04:16.479> you<00:04:16.659> know
