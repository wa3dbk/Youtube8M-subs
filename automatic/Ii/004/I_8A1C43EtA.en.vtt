00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.230
 in this episode of hart liver tv 

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.230
 the sonos playbar 

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:16.689
 welcome to heart wafer tv show los in 

00:00:14.590 --> 00:00:18.759
 a new device that is part of 

00:00:16.689 --> 00:00:20.110
 their baby products to wireless music 

00:00:18.759 --> 00:00:22.300
 being able to listen 

00:00:20.110 --> 00:00:24.610
 the device is the playbar and the name 

00:00:22.300 --> 00:00:26.260
 it already betrays it a bit 

00:00:24.610 --> 00:00:28.240
 I'm actually a bit of a samba 

00:00:26.260 --> 00:00:30.220
 server that do know of more brands 

00:00:28.240 --> 00:00:32.439
 intended to hang under the TV 

00:00:30.220 --> 00:00:33.519
 yes under a tv or the to put it 

00:00:32.439 --> 00:00:35.559
 doesn't really matter with it 

00:00:33.519 --> 00:00:37.570
 production can also tilt it, so then 

00:00:35.559 --> 00:00:39.250
 they can also put it right and then you can 

00:00:37.570 --> 00:00:40.590
 your mouth under the TV hang 

00:00:39.250 --> 00:00:43.149
 moves also have a nice keep for 

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:45.160
 I indeed particularly rich that 

00:00:43.149 --> 00:00:46.960
 like here but also the step to the home 

00:00:45.160 --> 00:00:47.440
 cinema makes you look but actually you were 

00:00:46.960 --> 00:00:49.539
 a 

00:00:47.440 --> 00:00:51.399
 a brand that mainly focuses on audio 

00:00:49.539 --> 00:00:52.930
 target with this product 

00:00:51.399 --> 00:00:54.430
 this is really just home cinema world 

00:00:52.930 --> 00:00:56.170
 boarding yes what a step back 

00:00:54.430 --> 00:00:58.110
 we have more often content we have tv 

00:00:56.170 --> 00:00:59.980
 had solos it is a system with 

00:00:58.110 --> 00:01:02.170
 different speakers that you can buy 

00:00:59.980 --> 00:01:04.119
 with which you can play your music wirelessly 

00:01:02.170 --> 00:01:06.539
 stream from example an appointment 

00:01:04.119 --> 00:01:08.619
 all pins an iphone or one 

00:01:06.539 --> 00:01:10.270
 radio services etcetera etcetera and 

00:01:08.619 --> 00:01:12.310
 actually the story was always before 

00:01:10.270 --> 00:01:14.289
 things like home cinema or connect to 

00:01:12.310 --> 00:01:16.179
 the TV is simply not suitable 

00:01:14.289 --> 00:01:18.130
 because it all looks like they grate through 

00:01:16.179 --> 00:01:18.819
 the network so it's always something of a 

00:01:18.130 --> 00:01:21.220
 who learn 

00:01:18.819 --> 00:01:24.280
 well a few and milliseconds or 

00:01:21.220 --> 00:01:25.660
 seconds dile of for music like that 

00:01:24.280 --> 00:01:26.259
 you make the sale to the spacers 

00:01:25.660 --> 00:01:28.209
 it up to you 

00:01:26.259 --> 00:01:31.270
 snakes but synchronized is only 

00:01:28.209 --> 00:01:32.709
 if the image and sound have to be psycho 

00:01:31.270 --> 00:01:34.060
 then it is not possible 

00:01:32.709 --> 00:01:35.709
 So that problem must have been solved 

00:01:34.060 --> 00:01:37.270
 well that is right and we have them whole 

00:01:35.709 --> 00:01:38.890
 much time i stopped chorus for about 2 years 

00:01:37.270 --> 00:01:41.349
 I hear rumors that they are working on this 

00:01:38.890 --> 00:01:42.789
 are reasonable so it actually says 

00:01:41.349 --> 00:01:44.500
 for finally for us 

00:01:42.789 --> 00:01:46.869
 yes and the trick is so heavy to containment 

00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:49.100
 through this this the optical cable on you 

00:01:46.869 --> 00:01:50.720
 television 

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:52.070
 there is also not much more than others 

00:01:50.720 --> 00:01:52.909
 connection to the seat is two more one 

00:01:52.070 --> 00:01:54.320
 network connection a 

00:01:52.909 --> 00:01:56.479
 power connection on 

00:01:54.320 --> 00:01:58.640
 and then it works special than that 

00:01:56.479 --> 00:02:00.590
 would say you can use it separately if 

00:01:58.640 --> 00:02:01.640
 speaker for your television or for music 

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:02.930
 to stream to 

00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:05.000
 my special is that he is also with others 

00:02:02.930 --> 00:02:06.979
 sonos products can work together you can 

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:08.929
 combine with these small ones are the play 

00:02:06.979 --> 00:02:11.090
 dries that ike that you are loose 

00:02:08.929 --> 00:02:12.830
 speakers that are also individually or 

00:02:11.090 --> 00:02:14.480
 together in the so-called stereo pair 

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:16.400
 but you can also use them 

00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:18.770
 like as rear speakers for this one 

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:20.420
 soundbar but then for the riots child 

00:02:18.770 --> 00:02:22.489
 what here cut him four are optical 

00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:24.200
 cable on the TV yes that is ticking 

00:02:22.489 --> 00:02:25.730
 direct connection is nothing 

00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:27.350
 network has to do with that 

00:02:25.730 --> 00:02:29.569
 sound synchronously running the TV 

00:02:27.350 --> 00:02:32.090
 bag not so special but the fact 

00:02:29.569 --> 00:02:34.430
 that you are the other who play 3 speakers 

00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:36.560
 can let him help and so that he 

00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:37.880
 actually be connected wirelessly 

00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:38.989
 and actually with no center 

00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:41.030
 worth mentioning 

00:02:38.989 --> 00:02:42.170
 fillet it will be able to leave the sound 

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:43.850
 hear that is special 

00:02:42.170 --> 00:02:46.430
 look and they also have some what 

00:02:43.850 --> 00:02:48.769
 tricks for it would have to be one 

00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:51.080
 themselves so use their own 

00:02:48.769 --> 00:02:54.560
 WiFi channel and technology that when they 

00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:56.360
 sonosnet and that that is independent 

00:02:54.560 --> 00:02:58.220
 from your own wireless network to 

00:02:56.360 --> 00:02:59.690
 With that they can take care of all that 

00:02:58.220 --> 00:03:01.310
 devices in your house because you can 

00:02:59.690 --> 00:03:02.660
 multiple rooms can set it up 

00:03:01.310 --> 00:03:04.519
 all can work well together 

00:03:02.660 --> 00:03:06.019
 without being dependent on you 8 

00:03:04.519 --> 00:03:08.120
 and 12 and where you might also find the 

00:03:06.019 --> 00:03:10.459
 pumping other data over it 

00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:12.410
 after they do so to both of them 

00:03:10.459 --> 00:03:16.220
 possibility is that 

00:03:12.410 --> 00:03:17.720
 I would say between this and the place 

00:03:16.220 --> 00:03:19.070
 then also becomes an extra network 

00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:21.530
 made and the makers use the 5 

00:03:19.070 --> 00:03:23.870
 gigahertz technology and in the ordinary 

00:03:21.530 --> 00:03:25.640
 sonosnet technology is from 2.4 

00:03:23.870 --> 00:03:27.500
 use gigahertz but for the relic 

00:03:25.640 --> 00:03:28.940
 it you have extensively tested yes you 

00:03:27.500 --> 00:03:31.100
 can reason 

00:03:28.940 --> 00:03:33.590
 and go wireless network traffic 

00:03:31.100 --> 00:03:35.780
 this unit after those two loose so there must be 

00:03:33.590 --> 00:03:37.489
 technically something from one that read its yes 

00:03:35.780 --> 00:03:38.780
 you hear it so absolutely do not hear anything 

00:03:37.489 --> 00:03:40.160
 don't you have to take a look 

00:03:38.780 --> 00:03:42.859
 it is nowadays with digital 

00:03:40.160 --> 00:03:44.120
 Television is true that you yes but 

00:03:42.859 --> 00:03:45.079
 you can see that in everything 

00:03:44.120 --> 00:03:47.390
 little that you occasionally have a little bit 

00:03:45.079 --> 00:03:48.739
 side 5 or it is completely lip-synch 

00:03:47.390 --> 00:03:49.970
 I have to say it is it 

00:03:48.739 --> 00:03:52.220
 similar to my receiver that 

00:03:49.970 --> 00:03:53.209
 use and I also get it occasionally 

00:03:52.220 --> 00:03:54.220
 a little bit on the whole 

00:03:53.209 --> 00:03:56.740
 lip synch and that 

00:03:54.220 --> 00:03:59.530
 a modern sony officer for so yes 

00:03:56.740 --> 00:04:01.390
 that that that that yes you always see it 

00:03:59.530 --> 00:04:03.280
 a little bit but it is awful 

00:04:01.390 --> 00:04:04.540
 well basically what they what they are that for 

00:04:03.280 --> 00:04:05.740
 get together with the system because is 

00:04:04.540 --> 00:04:08.110
 just equal to what you see with one 

00:04:05.740 --> 00:04:10.330
 with normal home cinema system yes and also 

00:04:08.110 --> 00:04:12.460
 the playbar actually becomes just like 

00:04:10.330 --> 00:04:13.330
 these types of speakers without a subwoofer 

00:04:12.460 --> 00:04:14.620
 delivered 

00:04:13.330 --> 00:04:16.239
 yes and sometimes it does have a subwoofer 

00:04:14.620 --> 00:04:18.160
 Always have a tile that you just want TV 

00:04:16.239 --> 00:04:19.450
 just link to it but it is not 

00:04:18.160 --> 00:04:20.650
 needed to use it even without 

00:04:19.450 --> 00:04:22.360
 subwoofer can actually bring out 

00:04:20.650 --> 00:04:24.190
 the feet yes it is of course always me 

00:04:22.360 --> 00:04:25.960
 where the question of yes sounds good 

00:04:24.190 --> 00:04:27.760
 something like this actually looks like the sit 

00:04:25.960 --> 00:04:29.500
 ie 9 speakers in total 

00:04:27.760 --> 00:04:31.240
 well i have to learn to say yes for one 

00:04:29.500 --> 00:04:32.890
 soundbar that sounds incredibly good with it 

00:04:31.240 --> 00:04:35.560
 it's a soundbar then watch again 

00:04:32.890 --> 00:04:37.240
 these speakers thereby combine 

00:04:35.560 --> 00:04:38.830
 it sounds richer and if you 

00:04:37.240 --> 00:04:40.840
 such a subwoofer adds yes then 

00:04:38.830 --> 00:04:42.520
 does it sound richer again, yes you can 

00:04:40.840 --> 00:04:44.110
 do you have your strong basses because yes 

00:04:42.520 --> 00:04:46.870
 look who is sitting here is a good one 

00:04:44.110 --> 00:04:48.250
 bassim super or need I can for 

00:04:46.870 --> 00:04:50.140
 provide was even more 

00:04:48.250 --> 00:04:52.330
 and if you don't like singles yet 

00:04:50.140 --> 00:04:54.250
 yes then this would actually be a whole 

00:04:52.330 --> 00:04:55.000
 suitable state first the device can 

00:04:54.250 --> 00:04:56.590
 are and 

00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:59.050
 I only want to get started with this thing 

00:04:56.590 --> 00:05:00.700
 with you a new sound via TV and all 

00:04:59.050 --> 00:05:02.500
 you get rid of those streaming options 

00:05:00.700 --> 00:05:03.310
 an on smoke spotify and I trade you 

00:05:02.500 --> 00:05:05.950
 get started right away 

00:05:03.310 --> 00:05:09.040
 yes that's right and whatever 

00:05:05.950 --> 00:05:10.690
 is nice is that if you choose this venue 

00:05:09.040 --> 00:05:12.190
 is that you indeed as 

00:05:10.690 --> 00:05:14.020
 can use starting point with with on with 

00:05:12.190 --> 00:05:15.850
 all those other devices so you can 

00:05:14.020 --> 00:05:16.540
 also connect s5 star to et 

00:05:15.850 --> 00:05:18.760
 cetera et cetera 

00:05:16.540 --> 00:05:20.229
 what I noticed is that if you say well 

00:05:18.760 --> 00:05:21.460
 from well i want to play my sound 

00:05:20.229 --> 00:05:22.900
 from the television 

00:05:21.460 --> 00:05:24.400
 and you will combine it all and 

00:05:22.900 --> 00:05:25.840
 you also notice all those other devices 

00:05:24.400 --> 00:05:26.169
 that a small person can take out a loan 

00:05:25.840 --> 00:05:27.790
 to sit 

00:05:26.169 --> 00:05:29.800
 but if you just put it within this set 

00:05:27.790 --> 00:05:31.660
 then it just goes well with and 

00:05:29.800 --> 00:05:33.340
 but for to bloom i suffered that's like you 

00:05:31.660 --> 00:05:35.500
 not only these three but also you 

00:05:33.340 --> 00:05:37.180
 andre-louis have left the after a year 

00:05:35.500 --> 00:05:38.860
 but if you also subwoofer our times s5 

00:05:37.180 --> 00:05:40.390
 fabric for play whisper at that are what 

00:05:38.860 --> 00:05:41.020
 larger of that device or if you still have 

00:05:40.390 --> 00:05:42.790
 more 

00:05:41.020 --> 00:05:45.280
 have an adapter on your phone 

00:05:42.790 --> 00:05:46.479
 you can connect to massive then 

00:05:45.280 --> 00:05:48.610
 you can be sure that this one gets to it 

00:05:46.479 --> 00:05:50.680
 listen to television if you just 

00:05:48.610 --> 00:05:51.880
 sound spray plays well then it sounds 

00:05:50.680 --> 00:05:54.250
 it just fantastic it is so pretty 

00:05:51.880 --> 00:05:56.140
 that they manage to get all those 

00:05:54.250 --> 00:05:57.490
 to run devices synchronously 

00:05:56.140 --> 00:05:59.890
 but still the clarity 

00:05:57.490 --> 00:06:02.680
 television they do playbar 

00:05:59.890 --> 00:06:04.240
 2 play dries as if and I as behind 

00:06:02.680 --> 00:06:05.830
 speakers and a subwoofer 

00:06:04.240 --> 00:06:07.120
 that just goes well yes it goes 

00:06:05.830 --> 00:06:07.550
 totally good and what 's funny 

00:06:07.120 --> 00:06:09.320
 is the 

00:06:07.550 --> 00:06:10.340
 the moment you put it in for music 

00:06:09.320 --> 00:06:11.270
 used and also set the 

00:06:10.340 --> 00:06:12.650
 rear speakers 

00:06:11.270 --> 00:06:14.360
 and then you make a kind of year because 

00:06:12.650 --> 00:06:16.190
 stereo landscapes and you can do 

00:06:14.360 --> 00:06:18.470
 suggest that it is pure to say yes 

00:06:16.190 --> 00:06:20.660
 that that that is not entirely okay look 

00:06:18.470 --> 00:06:21.500
 then you better go to standard stereo 

00:06:20.660 --> 00:06:22.850
 solution 

00:06:21.500 --> 00:06:24.560
 yes i must honestly say if i have it too 

00:06:22.850 --> 00:06:26.510
