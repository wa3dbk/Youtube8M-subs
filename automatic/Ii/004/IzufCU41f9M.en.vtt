might be someone he actually killed

00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:22.460 
might be someone he actually killed
personally<00:03:21.120> now<00:03:21.510> that<00:03:21.750> we<00:03:21.870> see<00:03:22.049> that<00:03:22.200> you<00:03:22.290> know

she knows friend is not death gun or you

00:03:24.209 --> 00:03:26.569 
she knows friend is not death gun or you

00:03:26.569 --> 00:03:26.579 
know supposedly not death done I kind of

00:03:26.579 --> 00:03:28.250 
know supposedly not death done I kind of
feel<00:03:26.790> like<00:03:26.849> that<00:03:27.120> person<00:03:27.359> in<00:03:27.569> Sao<00:03:27.870> that<00:03:28.139> had

00:03:28.250 --> 00:03:28.260 
feel like that person in Sao that had

00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:30.379 
feel like that person in Sao that had
the<00:03:28.379> mask<00:03:28.620> I<00:03:28.889> feel<00:03:29.400> like<00:03:29.579> that<00:03:29.760> is<00:03:29.970> death<00:03:30.180> come

00:03:30.379 --> 00:03:30.389 
the mask I feel like that is death come

00:03:30.389 --> 00:03:31.879 
the mask I feel like that is death come
back<00:03:30.540> I<00:03:30.690> feel<00:03:30.900> like<00:03:30.989> that's<00:03:31.139> him<00:03:31.379> that's<00:03:31.739> just

00:03:31.879 --> 00:03:31.889 
back I feel like that's him that's just

00:03:31.889 --> 00:03:33.589 
back I feel like that's him that's just
like<00:03:32.040> another<00:03:32.340> speculation<00:03:33.030> but<00:03:33.209> we<00:03:33.359> see

00:03:33.589 --> 00:03:33.599 
like another speculation but we see

00:03:33.599 --> 00:03:35.839 
like another speculation but we see
through<00:03:33.989> all<00:03:34.019> this<00:03:34.470> we<00:03:34.799> actually<00:03:35.010> get<00:03:35.459> to<00:03:35.489> see

00:03:35.839 --> 00:03:35.849 
through all this we actually get to see

00:03:35.849 --> 00:03:39.470 
through all this we actually get to see
that<00:03:36.449> scene<00:03:36.900> on<00:03:37.139> and<00:03:37.410> key<00:03:38.340> nieto<00:03:38.669> are<00:03:38.940> able<00:03:39.329> to

00:03:39.470 --> 00:03:39.480 
that scene on and key nieto are able to

00:03:39.480 --> 00:03:41.569 
that scene on and key nieto are able to
bond<00:03:39.780> over<00:03:39.989> this<00:03:40.199> because<00:03:40.410> they<00:03:40.680> have<00:03:40.919> similar

00:03:41.569 --> 00:03:41.579 
bond over this because they have similar

00:03:41.579 --> 00:03:43.849 
bond over this because they have similar
situations<00:03:42.449> see<00:03:42.930> no<00:03:43.109> to<00:03:43.169> kill<00:03:43.410> that<00:03:43.560> robber

00:03:43.849 --> 00:03:43.859 
situations see no to kill that robber

00:03:43.859 --> 00:03:46.220 
situations see no to kill that robber
with<00:03:44.069> a<00:03:44.129> gun<00:03:44.250> at<00:03:44.639> a<00:03:44.669> very<00:03:44.940> young<00:03:45.000> age<00:03:45.090> and<00:03:45.629> Quito

00:03:46.220 --> 00:03:46.230 
with a gun at a very young age and Quito

00:03:46.230 --> 00:03:48.319 
with a gun at a very young age and Quito
killed<00:03:46.560> people<00:03:46.949> in<00:03:46.980> a<00:03:47.370> game<00:03:47.609> but<00:03:48.060> they're<00:03:48.209> not

00:03:48.319 --> 00:03:48.329 
killed people in a game but they're not

00:03:48.329 --> 00:03:49.849 
killed people in a game but they're not
coming<00:03:48.599> back<00:03:48.690> at<00:03:48.750> all<00:03:48.989> now<00:03:49.260> because<00:03:49.620> of<00:03:49.650> those

00:03:49.849 --> 00:03:49.859 
coming back at all now because of those

00:03:49.859 --> 00:03:51.110 
coming back at all now because of those
two<00:03:49.919> scenes<00:03:50.400> and<00:03:50.639> because<00:03:50.879> of<00:03:50.910> those<00:03:51.060> two

00:03:51.110 --> 00:03:51.120 
two scenes and because of those two

00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:52.789 
two scenes and because of those two
similarities<00:03:51.840> that<00:03:52.019> connect<00:03:52.260> though<00:03:52.440> and<00:03:52.650> see

00:03:52.789 --> 00:03:52.799 
similarities that connect though and see

00:03:52.799 --> 00:03:54.589 
similarities that connect though and see
don't<00:03:53.010> have<00:03:53.220> they're<00:03:53.669> able<00:03:53.879> to<00:03:54.120> bond<00:03:54.419> over

00:03:54.589 --> 00:03:54.599 
don't have they're able to bond over

00:03:54.599 --> 00:03:56.930 
don't have they're able to bond over
them<00:03:54.900> become<00:03:55.290> closer<00:03:55.590> so<00:03:56.010> that<00:03:56.040> whole<00:03:56.609> scene

00:03:56.930 --> 00:03:56.940 
them become closer so that whole scene

00:03:56.940 --> 00:03:58.610
