on BBC world with CNN saying how great
it<00:06:45.670> is<00:06:45.880> even<00:06:46.360> though<00:06:46.420> there's<00:06:46.810> a<00:06:46.870> bit<00:06:47.020> of<00:06:47.110> that

going<00:06:47.500> on<00:06:47.590> anyway<00:06:47.950> I<00:06:48.160> think<00:06:48.550> what<00:06:48.790> needs<00:06:48.820> to

00:06:48.960 --> 00:06:48.970 
going on anyway I think what needs to

00:06:48.970 --> 00:06:51.150 
going on anyway I think what needs to
happen<00:06:49.030> is<00:06:49.360> people<00:06:49.390> need<00:06:49.780> to<00:06:49.870> see<00:06:49.990> a<00:06:50.020> plan<00:06:50.320> if

00:06:51.150 --> 00:06:51.160 
happen is people need to see a plan if

00:06:51.160 --> 00:06:53.130 
happen is people need to see a plan if

you look at I think an international
investor<00:06:53.560> community<00:06:53.950> I<00:06:54.250> think<00:06:54.520> they<00:06:54.640> want<00:06:54.820> to

00:06:54.870 --> 00:06:54.880 
investor community I think they want to

00:06:54.880 --> 00:06:56.880

00:07:02.340 --> 00:07:02.350 
going to set if a semiconductor plant I

00:07:02.350 --> 00:07:03.810 
going to set if a semiconductor plant I
want<00:07:02.860> to<00:07:02.950> make<00:07:03.100> sure<00:07:03.130> there's<00:07:03.430> a<00:07:03.490> trained

workforce<00:07:04.420> here<00:07:04.930> and<00:07:05.110> I<00:07:05.140> think<00:07:05.290> you<00:07:05.350> only<00:07:05.440> have

00:07:05.580 --> 00:07:05.590 
workforce here and I think you only have

00:07:05.590 --> 00:07:07.260 
workforce here and I think you only have
to<00:07:05.680> look<00:07:05.770> at<00:07:05.890> this<00:07:05.980> country<00:07:06.310> versus<00:07:06.610> Germany<00:07:06.850> I

00:07:07.260 --> 00:07:07.270 
to look at this country versus Germany I

00:07:07.270 --> 00:07:10.260 
to look at this country versus Germany I
think<00:07:07.480> I<00:07:07.840> think<00:07:08.230> business<00:07:08.650> our<00:07:09.100> peers<00:07:09.550> want<00:07:10.090> to

00:07:10.260 --> 00:07:10.270 
think I think business our peers want to

00:07:10.270 --> 00:07:11.940 
think I think business our peers want to
see<00:07:10.420> a<00:07:10.450> plan<00:07:10.900> we<00:07:11.380> haven't<00:07:11.560> heard<00:07:11.710> that<00:07:11.830> this

00:07:11.940 --> 00:07:11.950 
see a plan we haven't heard that this
