00:00:07.350 --> 00:00:14.700
 well I started as a coach in the 

00:00:11.240 --> 00:00:16.740
 2003 2004 in a third team 

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:20.039
 argentine edition 

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:22.220
 and we left champions and ascended after 

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:25.150
 I went 

00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:27.640
 with the Galician tolo 

00:00:25.150 --> 00:00:31.539
 and we left champions of the same year in 

00:00:27.640 --> 00:00:36.220
 June a championship in December we had 

00:00:31.539 --> 00:00:38.190
 the luck of another after all with him 

00:00:36.220 --> 00:00:40.649
 I also in toluca 

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:43.680
 and then I called to open the way 

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:45.829
 again just to choose new the sip 

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:51.050
 vision argentina san martÃ­n de san juan 

00:00:45.829 --> 00:00:51.050
 then to chile audax italiano 

00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:55.360
 from audax to jaguars 

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:59.130
 then again I went back to audax 

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:01.980
 Italian 

00:00:59.130 --> 00:01:05.309
 the previous step by a promotion club 

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:11.460
 united youth of san luis 

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:15.979
 later to atlante miners of zacatecas 

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:15.979
 in the middle of all that pachuca 

00:01:17.680 --> 00:01:24.610
 with the global participation of clubs and 

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:28.600
 dust on the miners the last team 

00:01:24.610 --> 00:01:32.440
 that was the style that one always tries 

00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:35.190
 to propose and to be reflected 

00:01:32.440 --> 00:01:39.040
 within the field is that a team is 

00:01:35.190 --> 00:01:41.430
 offensive that is aggressive but in turn 

00:01:39.040 --> 00:01:45.340
 Try to be balanced teams 

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:47.740
 let them make power many times 

00:01:45.340 --> 00:01:50.829
 most of the time other plasma 

00:01:47.740 --> 00:01:53.469
 always not, but the intention is always 

00:01:50.829 --> 00:01:57.509
 that of providing a good show in 

00:01:53.469 --> 00:02:00.520
 principle we are in very shape 

00:01:57.509 --> 00:02:04.630
 coincident with the project that we 

00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:07.179
 he presented both president and 

00:02:04.630 --> 00:02:10.569
 sports director the fundamental idea 

00:02:07.179 --> 00:02:14.410
 today the priority is this first 

00:02:10.569 --> 00:02:17.049
 tournament where we want all 

00:02:14.410 --> 00:02:20.349
 balance those percentage accounts 

00:02:17.049 --> 00:02:22.110
 those numbers so it would imply for 

00:02:20.349 --> 00:02:26.170
 us a very important goal 

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:28.630
 qualify god through a group that 

00:02:26.170 --> 00:02:31.200
 It has not been possible for many years 

00:02:28.630 --> 00:02:33.330
 have that 

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:35.700
 of that possibility of enjoying what 

00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:38.160
 is a Mexican soccer league and 

00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:40.700
 then if you just think about what 

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:43.950
 means the liberators cup before not 

00:02:40.700 --> 00:02:47.680
 rate the league like this 

00:02:43.950 --> 00:02:50.950
 from as simple and as complicated as 

00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:53.650
 it is to qualify but I think that it is 

00:02:50.950 --> 00:02:55.500
 forming a very good campus with 

00:02:53.650 --> 00:02:57.940
 a lot of effort on the part of the board 

00:02:55.500 --> 00:03:00.640
 as for 

00:02:57.940 --> 00:03:02.380
 have that internal competence that we 

00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:05.950
 allow each of the players 

00:03:02.380 --> 00:03:08.220
 render in its maximum expression which is the 

00:03:05.950 --> 00:03:08.220
 message 

00:03:08.700 --> 00:03:13.590
 really continue to support as 

00:03:10.980 --> 00:03:17.489
 they always did because one is reflected 

00:03:13.590 --> 00:03:19.910
 who played several times against the 

00:03:17.489 --> 00:03:19.910
 village 

00:03:20.010 --> 00:03:26.700
 faithfulness you have with the team 

00:03:23.970 --> 00:03:29.099
 fans really fill the stadium 

00:03:26.700 --> 00:03:30.930
 it's a big team and that really 

00:03:29.099 --> 00:03:34.349
 continue to maintain that support as 

00:03:30.930 --> 00:03:37.260
 we are going to need and have the 

00:03:34.349 --> 00:03:39.810
 hope and confidence in all this new 

00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:42.659
 project that he heads and in all this 

00:03:39.810 --> 00:03:44.930
 technical body to perform with whom 

00:03:42.659 --> 00:03:47.530
 phrase would define 

00:03:44.930 --> 00:03:49.959
 or a word like I would define 

00:03:47.530 --> 00:03:52.440
 what the village will look like 

00:03:49.959 --> 00:03:56.030
 translate it into the field 

00:03:52.440 --> 00:03:56.030
 we are much more than 11
