even though i think the rav4 is coming
up<00:00:35.190> for<00:00:35.670> I<00:00:36.270> think<00:00:36.750> about<00:00:37.110> 12<00:00:37.469> years<00:00:37.620> old<00:00:37.860> now

00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:38.070 
up for I think about 12 years old now

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:40.580 
up for I think about 12 years old now
we've<00:00:38.219> had<00:00:38.340> it<00:00:38.460> since<00:00:38.670> new<00:00:39.120> but<00:00:40.110> we've<00:00:40.260> always

00:00:40.580 --> 00:00:40.590 
we've had it since new but we've always

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:43.819 
we've had it since new but we've always
really<00:00:41.219> looked<00:00:41.399> after<00:00:41.610> it<00:00:42.030> so<00:00:42.960> the<00:00:43.440> the<00:00:43.710> only

00:00:43.819 --> 00:00:43.829 
really looked after it so the the only

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:45.350 
really looked after it so the the only
thing<00:00:44.190> that<00:00:44.309> we<00:00:44.399> were<00:00:44.579> annoyed<00:00:44.850> about<00:00:45.000> was

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:45.360 
thing that we were annoyed about was

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:47.750 
thing that we were annoyed about was
when<00:00:45.899> we<00:00:46.050> had<00:00:46.200> the<00:00:46.260> brakes<00:00:46.590> done<00:00:46.800> about<00:00:47.010> 23

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:47.760 
when we had the brakes done about 23

when we had the brakes done about 23
years<00:00:48.000> ago<00:00:48.270> they<00:00:48.989> continually<00:00:49.559> squeaked<00:00:50.129> and

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:50.370 
years ago they continually squeaked and

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:52.700 
years ago they continually squeaked and
we<00:00:51.030> took<00:00:51.239> it<00:00:51.390> in<00:00:51.510> on<00:00:51.629> two<00:00:51.840> occasions<00:00:52.170> to<00:00:52.559> get

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:52.710 
we took it in on two occasions to get

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:55.220 
we took it in on two occasions to get
checked<00:00:52.980> and<00:00:53.370> on<00:00:54.239> both<00:00:54.390> occasions<00:00:54.570> they

00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:55.230 
checked and on both occasions they

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:56.990 
checked and on both occasions they
couldn't<00:00:55.559> find<00:00:55.680> anything<00:00:55.980> wrong<00:00:56.129> well<00:00:56.640> lo<00:00:56.969> and

couldn't find anything wrong well lo and

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:59.119 
couldn't find anything wrong well lo and
behold<00:00:57.180> this<00:00:57.510> time<00:00:57.809> they<00:00:58.469> said<00:00:58.800> that<00:00:58.949> they

00:00:59.119 --> 00:00:59.129 
behold this time they said that they

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:01.099 
behold this time they said that they
took<00:00:59.579> the<00:00:59.730> breaks<00:00:59.969> apart<00:01:00.270> and<00:01:00.570> one<00:01:00.930> of<00:01:01.020> the

00:01:01.099 --> 00:01:01.109 
took the breaks apart and one of the

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:03.830 
took the breaks apart and one of the
calipers<00:01:01.620> was<00:01:01.980> stuck<00:01:02.670> or<00:01:03.000> the<00:01:03.149> pin<00:01:03.390> was<00:01:03.570> stuck

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:06.540 
or something and that had caused the

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:09.560 
or something and that had caused the
brakes<00:01:06.780> to<00:01:07.049> wear<00:01:07.260> unevenly<00:01:07.909> so<00:01:08.909> not<00:01:09.240> only<00:01:09.360> did

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:09.570 
brakes to wear unevenly so not only did

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:11.210 
brakes to wear unevenly so not only did
they<00:01:09.750> fix<00:01:09.930> the<00:01:10.110> caliper<00:01:10.530> but<00:01:10.860> they<00:01:11.010> also

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:11.220 
they fix the caliper but they also

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:13.820 
they fix the caliper but they also
actually<00:01:12.150> changed<00:01:12.540> the<00:01:12.600> front<00:01:12.930> brake<00:01:13.260> pads<00:01:13.290> as

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:13.830 
actually changed the front brake pads as

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:15.649 
actually changed the front brake pads as

was sort of similar but engaging

00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:30.350 
was sort of similar but engaging
nonetheless<00:02:29.010> I'm<00:02:29.460> not<00:02:29.610> going<00:02:29.790> to<00:02:29.850> say<00:02:30.030> any

on<00:02:40.800> the<00:02:41.310> samsung<00:02:41.910> gear<00:02:42.150> fit<00:02:42.600> really<00:02:43.380> enjoying

00:02:43.820 --> 00:02:43.830 
on the samsung gear fit really enjoying

00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:44.990 
on the samsung gear fit really enjoying
this<00:02:44.040> and<00:02:44.280> I<00:02:44.310> found<00:02:44.490> that<00:02:44.640> you<00:02:44.730> could<00:02:44.820> actually

00:02:44.990 --> 00:02:45.000 
this and I found that you could actually

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:48.080 
this and I found that you could actually
change<00:02:45.540> the<00:02:45.960> orientation<00:02:46.620> of<00:02:47.370> the<00:02:47.430> display

00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:48.090 
change the orientation of the display

00:02:48.090 --> 00:02:50.000 
change the orientation of the display
around<00:02:48.690> to<00:02:49.050> this<00:02:49.140> sort<00:02:49.410> of<00:02:49.440> vertical

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:50.010 
around to this sort of vertical

00:02:50.010 --> 00:02:52.460 
around to this sort of vertical
orientation<00:02:50.570> so<00:02:51.570> when<00:02:51.780> it's<00:02:51.930> on<00:02:52.050> your<00:02:52.140> wrist

00:02:52.460 --> 00:02:52.470 
orientation so when it's on your wrist

00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:54.860 
orientation so when it's on your wrist
at<00:02:52.770> least<00:02:52.980> it's<00:02:53.250> a<00:02:53.400> lot<00:02:53.580> easier<00:02:53.610> to<00:02:53.940> read<00:02:54.330> I'm

00:02:54.860 --> 00:02:54.870 
at least it's a lot easier to read I'm

00:02:54.870 --> 00:02:57.199 
at least it's a lot easier to read I'm
really<00:02:55.230> sort<00:02:55.800> of<00:02:55.890> enjoying<00:02:56.190> it<00:02:56.430> it<00:02:56.760> got<00:02:57.000> very

00:02:57.199 --> 00:02:57.209 
really sort of enjoying it it got very

00:02:57.209 --> 00:02:59.090 
really sort of enjoying it it got very

00:03:01.100 --> 00:03:01.110 
impressed with it and even without

00:03:01.110 --> 00:03:04.970

one of the other galaxy devices it could

one of the other galaxy devices it could

still function separately as sort of a

00:03:10.590 --> 00:03:12.350 
still function separately as sort of a
SmartWatch<00:03:11.130> you<00:03:11.370> would<00:03:11.550> have<00:03:11.700> limited<00:03:12.090> source

00:03:12.350 --> 00:03:12.360 
SmartWatch you would have limited source

00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:14.690 
SmartWatch you would have limited source
synchronization<00:03:13.230> obviously<00:03:13.770> but<00:03:14.280> I'm<00:03:14.370> hoping

00:03:14.690 --> 00:03:14.700 
synchronization obviously but I'm hoping

00:03:14.700 --> 00:03:16.460 
synchronization obviously but I'm hoping
that<00:03:14.880> somebody<00:03:15.060> actually<00:03:15.209> cracks<00:03:15.810> this<00:03:16.080> and

00:03:16.460 --> 00:03:16.470 
that somebody actually cracks this and

00:03:16.470 --> 00:03:17.960 
that somebody actually cracks this and
gives<00:03:16.709> us<00:03:16.860> some<00:03:17.100> way<00:03:17.250> of<00:03:17.370> connecting<00:03:17.610> this<00:03:17.910> to

00:03:17.960 --> 00:03:17.970 
gives us some way of connecting this to

00:03:17.970 --> 00:03:20.210 
gives us some way of connecting this to
the<00:03:18.209> iphone<00:03:18.630> that<00:03:19.200> would<00:03:19.350> be<00:03:19.440> absolutely<00:03:19.890> epic

00:03:20.210 --> 00:03:20.220 
the iphone that would be absolutely epic

00:03:20.220 --> 00:03:23.030 
the iphone that would be absolutely epic
so<00:03:20.640> any<00:03:20.790> clever<00:03:21.480> coders<00:03:22.050> out<00:03:22.200> there<00:03:22.440> there's<00:03:22.980> a

00:03:23.030 --> 00:03:23.040 
so any clever coders out there there's a

00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:25.040 
so any clever coders out there there's a
little<00:03:23.280> challenge<00:03:23.670> for<00:03:24.000> you<00:03:24.150> see<00:03:24.720> if<00:03:24.780> you<00:03:24.900> can
