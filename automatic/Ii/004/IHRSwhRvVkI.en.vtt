00:00:09.560 --> 00:00:12.560
 adversary 

00:00:13.239 --> 00:00:15.369
 to create a putter like and capable 

00:00:15.369 --> 00:00:16.800
 repel such a gift requires huge

00:00:27.279 --> 00:00:29.710
 a thousand two hundred years ago and used to play 

00:00:29.710 --> 00:00:32.710
 in arlington some kind of what rules 

00:00:35.860 --> 00:00:37.530
 in the seventeenth century the american indians 

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:39.780
 used curved clubs in the game which 

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:40.990
 not called 

00:00:40.990 --> 00:00:43.990
 brother say so 

00:00:44.950 --> 00:00:47.290
 habitual for our idea which appeared in 

00:00:47.290 --> 00:00:50.470
 1885 in kingston ontario where 

00:00:50.470 --> 00:00:51.970
 british soldier from behind this game

00:00:56.650 --> 00:00:59.650
 Well 

00:01:01.390 --> 00:01:03.740
 ii 

00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:05.970
 boiler rooms are made of 

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:07.320
 several layers of wood and 

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:10.010
 fiberglass all these crumbs hiccups and sticks 

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:12.880
 great hockey players 

00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:16.010
 to make a suit only 

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:17.440
 that this country is being pasted 

00:01:17.440 --> 00:01:20.860

 Action for now in the region 

00:01:27.070 --> 00:01:30.920
 so why is it many years of view of Belarus 

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:32.990
 same business in April before 

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:35.450
 so much merit 

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:37.270

 everywhere drivers for which 

00:01:51.910 --> 00:01:53.570
 fasten is worth the problem was solved 

00:01:53.570 --> 00:01:54.470

00:02:06.610 --> 00:02:08.069
 m 

00:02:08.069 --> 00:02:09.530
 then the club goes to

 crank wooden blocks along to 

00:02:45.619 --> 00:02:47.529
 it was possible to put a spatula

 PC 

00:03:25.109 --> 00:03:27.639
 there is difficult now the spatula need 

00:03:27.639 --> 00:03:29.919
 immediately and withstand a passport in 

00:03:29.919 --> 00:03:31.839

00:04:22.509 --> 00:04:26.309
 Circle surface is smoothed to 

00:04:26.309 --> 00:04:27.990
 take the bubbles placed in the oven for
