00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:19.560 
anime studio version 5 I have seven so

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:21.560 
anime studio version 5 I have seven so
i'm<00:00:19.710> not<00:00:19.830> sure<00:00:19.890> if<00:00:20.160> it<00:00:20.279> the<00:00:20.820> masking<00:00:21.300> is<00:00:21.420> the

00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:21.570 
i'm not sure if it the masking is the

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:24.679 
i'm not sure if it the masking is the
same<00:00:21.980> what<00:00:22.980> I'm<00:00:23.100> going<00:00:23.220> to<00:00:23.279> do<00:00:23.460> is<00:00:23.730> I'm<00:00:24.330> going

00:00:24.679 --> 00:00:24.689 
same what I'm going to do is I'm going

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:29.120 
same what I'm going to do is I'm going
to<00:00:24.750> import<00:00:25.380> an<00:00:25.680> image<00:00:27.140> and<00:00:28.140> this<00:00:28.410> is<00:00:28.529> just<00:00:28.740> some

00:00:29.120 --> 00:00:29.130 
to import an image and this is just some

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:30.859 
to import an image and this is just some
picture<00:00:29.429> I<00:00:29.490> found<00:00:29.519> of<00:00:29.820> a<00:00:29.939> kid<00:00:30.119> on<00:00:30.330> the<00:00:30.359> internet

00:00:30.859 --> 00:00:30.869 
picture I found of a kid on the internet

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:33.319 
picture I found of a kid on the internet
I<00:00:31.759> just<00:00:32.759> thought<00:00:32.850> it<00:00:32.969> would<00:00:33.030> be<00:00:33.090> a<00:00:33.180> good

00:00:33.319 --> 00:00:33.329 
I just thought it would be a good

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:34.430 
I just thought it would be a good
example<00:00:33.450> because<00:00:33.809> he<00:00:34.020> has<00:00:34.110> a<00:00:34.140> background

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:34.440 
example because he has a background

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:39.880 
example because he has a background
behind<00:00:34.860> them<00:00:35.570> my<00:00:36.570> import<00:00:36.989> that<00:00:37.140> image<00:00:37.530> and

00:00:39.880 --> 00:00:39.890 

00:00:39.890 --> 00:00:43.850 

just<00:00:40.890> shrunk<00:00:41.100> it<00:00:41.250> down<00:00:41.280> now<00:00:42.200> over<00:00:43.200> here<00:00:43.649> in

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:43.860 
just shrunk it down now over here in

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:46.549 
just shrunk it down now over here in
your<00:00:44.190> layers<00:00:44.399> palette<00:00:45.110> i'm<00:00:46.110> going<00:00:46.260> to<00:00:46.350> create

00:00:46.549 --> 00:00:46.559 
your layers palette i'm going to create

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:49.400 
your layers palette i'm going to create
a<00:00:46.649> group<00:00:46.890> layer<00:00:47.129> and<00:00:47.610> I'm<00:00:48.390> going<00:00:48.450> to<00:00:48.600> put<00:00:48.870> that

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:49.410 
a group layer and I'm going to put that

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:55.250 
a group layer and I'm going to put that
picture<00:00:49.820> and<00:00:50.820> the<00:00:51.690> default<00:00:52.649> layer<00:00:53.129> one<00:00:53.489> in<00:00:54.260> the

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:55.260 
picture and the default layer one in the

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:57.229 
picture and the default layer one in the
in<00:00:55.920> that<00:00:56.250> group<00:00:56.430> also<00:00:56.610> i'm<00:00:56.850> going<00:00:57.000> to<00:00:57.059> put<00:00:57.149> it

00:00:57.229 --> 00:00:57.239 
in that group also i'm going to put it

00:00:57.239 --> 00:00:59.330 
in that group also i'm going to put it
on<00:00:57.329> the<00:00:57.449> bottom<00:00:57.809> and<00:00:58.020> you'll<00:00:59.010> see<00:00:59.160> what<00:00:59.250> i'm

00:00:59.330 --> 00:00:59.340 
on the bottom and you'll see what i'm

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:02.060 
on the bottom and you'll see what i'm
doing<00:00:59.399> that<00:00:59.579> here<00:00:59.879> in<00:00:59.940> a<00:01:00.030> second<00:01:00.920> with<00:01:01.920> the

00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:02.070 
doing that here in a second with the

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:03.979 
doing that here in a second with the
layers<00:01:02.309> one<00:01:03.059> selected<00:01:03.510> I'm<00:01:03.629> going<00:01:03.660> to<00:01:03.840> create

00:01:03.979 --> 00:01:03.989 
layers one selected I'm going to create

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:05.929 
layers one selected I'm going to create
a<00:01:04.080> new<00:01:04.110> vector<00:01:04.500> and<00:01:04.949> you<00:01:05.519> can<00:01:05.640> see<00:01:05.820> I<00:01:05.850> already

00:01:05.929 --> 00:01:05.939 
a new vector and you can see I already

00:01:05.939 --> 00:01:07.789 
a new vector and you can see I already
have<00:01:06.299> a<00:01:06.330> auto<00:01:06.600> fill<00:01:06.930> and<00:01:07.140> auto<00:01:07.350> stroke

00:01:07.789 --> 00:01:07.799 
have a auto fill and auto stroke

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:11.210 
have a auto fill and auto stroke
selected<00:01:08.369> so<00:01:08.909> it's<00:01:09.060> got<00:01:09.299> a<00:01:09.330> white<00:01:09.710> fill<00:01:10.710> in<00:01:10.950> it

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:11.220 
selected so it's got a white fill in it

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:14.450 
selected so it's got a white fill in it
already<00:01:11.369> and<00:01:11.700> I'm<00:01:12.570> putting<00:01:12.869> it<00:01:12.990> behind<00:01:13.680> the

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:14.460 
already and I'm putting it behind the

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:17.450 
already and I'm putting it behind the
picture<00:01:14.990> because<00:01:15.990> I<00:01:16.290> haven't<00:01:16.500> quite<00:01:17.009> mastered

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:17.460 
picture because I haven't quite mastered

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:21.920 
picture because I haven't quite mastered
or<00:01:18.150> figured<00:01:19.140> out<00:01:19.290> how<00:01:20.360> masking<00:01:21.360> works<00:01:21.570> but<00:01:21.900> I

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:21.930 
or figured out how masking works but I

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:25.550 
or figured out how masking works but I
know<00:01:22.020> that<00:01:22.140> the<00:01:22.500> bottom<00:01:22.799> layer<00:01:23.090> when<00:01:24.560> you

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:25.560 
know that the bottom layer when you

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:29.179 
know that the bottom layer when you
select<00:01:25.770> it<00:01:26.159> and<00:01:26.340> go<00:01:27.180> into<00:01:27.360> the<00:01:28.020> group<00:01:28.950> layer

00:01:29.179 --> 00:01:29.189 
select it and go into the group layer

00:01:29.189 --> 00:01:34.039 
select it and go into the group layer
here<00:01:29.640> and<00:01:29.880> do<00:01:30.450> masking<00:01:30.990> hi<00:01:31.200> doll<00:01:32.659> now<00:01:33.659> that

00:01:34.039 --> 00:01:34.049 
here and do masking hi doll now that

00:01:34.049 --> 00:01:37.640 
here and do masking hi doll now that
circle<00:01:34.979> has<00:01:35.130> become<00:01:35.520> the<00:01:36.479> mask<00:01:36.750> or<00:01:37.079> what<00:01:37.320> what

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:37.650 
circle has become the mask or what what

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:43.700 
circle has become the mask or what what
you<00:01:37.770> can<00:01:37.920> see<00:01:38.930> so<00:01:39.930> if<00:01:40.079> I<00:01:40.259> select<00:01:41.000> that<00:01:42.710> circle

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:43.710 
you can see so if I select that circle

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:47.420 
you can see so if I select that circle
the<00:01:44.180> vector<00:01:45.180> layer<00:01:45.390> and<00:01:45.750> then<00:01:45.899> go<00:01:46.140> in<00:01:46.380> and<00:01:46.649> add

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:47.430 
the vector layer and then go in and add

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:50.600 
the vector layer and then go in and add
points<00:01:48.259> and<00:01:49.259> then<00:01:49.500> you<00:01:49.649> can<00:01:50.009> really<00:01:50.159> refine

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:50.610 
points and then you can really refine

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:53.660 
points and then you can really refine
this<00:01:51.200> you<00:01:52.200> know<00:01:52.350> so<00:01:52.979> it<00:01:53.070> looks<00:01:53.100> really<00:01:53.430> good

00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:53.670 
this you know so it looks really good

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:55.100 
this you know so it looks really good
i'm<00:01:53.909> just<00:01:54.090> doing<00:01:54.299> this<00:01:54.360> really<00:01:54.600> fast<00:01:54.780> so<00:01:54.990> you

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:55.110 
i'm just doing this really fast so you

00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:58.940 
i'm just doing this really fast so you
can<00:01:55.229> see<00:01:55.409> what<00:01:55.530> i'm<00:01:55.590> talking<00:01:55.680> about<00:01:57.560> so<00:01:58.560> let's

00:01:58.940 --> 00:01:58.950 
can see what i'm talking about so let's

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:00.649 
can see what i'm talking about so let's
just<00:01:59.130> say<00:01:59.250> i<00:01:59.280> cut<00:01:59.610> its<00:01:59.759> head<00:01:59.880> out<00:02:00.119> really<00:02:00.479> good

00:02:00.649 --> 00:02:00.659 
just say i cut its head out really good

00:02:00.659 --> 00:02:05.870 
just say i cut its head out really good
i'm<00:02:01.229> also<00:02:01.439> going<00:02:01.799> to<00:02:03.890> do<00:02:04.890> the<00:02:05.189> technique<00:02:05.460> that

00:02:05.870 --> 00:02:05.880 
i'm also going to do the technique that

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:10.880 
i'm also going to do the technique that
JibJab<00:02:06.780> uses<00:02:07.200> on<00:02:07.380> their<00:02:07.530> website<00:02:07.920> and<00:02:09.890> i'm

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:10.890 
JibJab uses on their website and i'm

00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:13.430 
JibJab uses on their website and i'm
going<00:02:11.069> to<00:02:11.129> add<00:02:11.760> some<00:02:11.790> more<00:02:12.330> points<00:02:12.599> and

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:13.440 
going to add some more points and

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:18.320 
going to add some more points and
actually<00:02:13.800> take<00:02:14.010> out<00:02:14.160> his<00:02:14.310> bottom<00:02:14.700> jaw<00:02:17.330> adding

00:02:18.320 --> 00:02:18.330 
actually take out his bottom jaw adding

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:22.940 
actually take out his bottom jaw adding
some<00:02:18.510> more<00:02:18.630> points<00:02:20.180> moving<00:02:21.180> this<00:02:21.270> around<00:02:21.950> so

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:22.950 
some more points moving this around so

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:25.490 
some more points moving this around so
I'm<00:02:23.100> asking<00:02:23.280> out<00:02:23.670> his<00:02:23.850> bottom<00:02:24.180> jaw<00:02:24.390> now<00:02:25.050> since

00:02:25.490 --> 00:02:25.500 
I'm asking out his bottom jaw now since

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:27.890 
I'm asking out his bottom jaw now since
you<00:02:25.680> already<00:02:25.860> have<00:02:26.190> all<00:02:26.550> of<00:02:26.850> this<00:02:27.000> in<00:02:27.180> a<00:02:27.570> group

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:27.900 
you already have all of this in a group

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:30.970 
you already have all of this in a group
layer<00:02:28.110> you<00:02:28.980> can<00:02:29.010> select<00:02:29.430> the<00:02:30.090> group

00:02:30.970 --> 00:02:30.980 
layer you can select the group

00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:36.430 
layer you can select the group
duplicated<00:02:31.980> and<00:02:32.540> then<00:02:33.540> on<00:02:33.960> the<00:02:34.410> bottom<00:02:35.060> the

00:02:36.430 --> 00:02:36.440 
duplicated and then on the bottom the

00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:40.550 
duplicated and then on the bottom the
bottom<00:02:37.440> group<00:02:37.950> layer<00:02:38.210> I'm<00:02:39.210> going<00:02:39.270> to<00:02:39.870> select

00:02:40.550 --> 00:02:40.560 
bottom group layer I'm going to select

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:43.190 
bottom group layer I'm going to select
the<00:02:41.070> shape<00:02:41.280> again<00:02:41.670> and<00:02:42.030> now<00:02:42.690> i'm<00:02:42.750> actually

00:02:43.190 --> 00:02:43.200 
the shape again and now i'm actually

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:48.470 
the shape again and now i'm actually
going<00:02:43.590> to<00:02:44.060> delete<00:02:45.060> it<00:02:45.350> oops<00:02:47.360> select<00:02:48.360> the

00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:48.480 
going to delete it oops select the

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:57.020 
going to delete it oops select the
bottom<00:02:48.780> layer<00:02:50.390> whereas<00:02:51.500> oh<00:02:53.510> it<00:02:54.510> was<00:02:56.030> deleted

00:02:57.020 --> 00:02:57.030 
bottom layer whereas oh it was deleted

00:02:57.030 --> 00:03:00.350 
bottom layer whereas oh it was deleted
you<00:02:57.780> know<00:02:57.900> there's<00:02:58.170> the<00:02:58.650> original<00:02:59.300> this<00:03:00.300> is

00:03:00.350 --> 00:03:00.360 
you know there's the original this is

00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:02.030 
you know there's the original this is
the<00:03:00.690> new<00:03:00.840> one<00:03:00.990> and<00:03:01.230> now<00:03:01.470> that<00:03:01.650> I've<00:03:01.770> deleted

00:03:02.030 --> 00:03:02.040 
the new one and now that I've deleted

00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:05.180 
the new one and now that I've deleted
the<00:03:02.280> vector<00:03:03.380> layer<00:03:04.380> you<00:03:04.560> can't<00:03:04.770> see<00:03:04.920> anything

00:03:05.180 --> 00:03:05.190 
the vector layer you can't see anything

00:03:05.190 --> 00:03:08.600 
the vector layer you can't see anything
so<00:03:05.400> I'm<00:03:05.460> going<00:03:05.580> to<00:03:05.640> redraw<00:03:05.940> a<00:03:06.800> shape<00:03:07.800> I'll<00:03:08.250> just

00:03:08.600 --> 00:03:08.610 
so I'm going to redraw a shape I'll just

00:03:08.610 --> 00:03:13.550 
so I'm going to redraw a shape I'll just
use<00:03:08.790> the<00:03:09.620> rectangle<00:03:12.200> going<00:03:13.200> to<00:03:13.260> move<00:03:13.410> the

00:03:13.550 --> 00:03:13.560 
use the rectangle going to move the

00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:16.220 
use the rectangle going to move the
vertices<00:03:13.710> to<00:03:14.700> the<00:03:15.150> bottom<00:03:15.450> jaw<00:03:15.630> what<00:03:15.930> we<00:03:16.020> cut

00:03:16.220 --> 00:03:16.230 
vertices to the bottom jaw what we cut

00:03:16.230 --> 00:03:21.140 
vertices to the bottom jaw what we cut
out<00:03:16.410> of<00:03:16.620> the<00:03:17.040> first<00:03:17.310> one<00:03:19.580> like<00:03:20.580> I<00:03:20.700> said<00:03:20.760> this<00:03:21.090> is

00:03:21.140 --> 00:03:21.150 
out of the first one like I said this is

00:03:21.150 --> 00:03:25.070 
out of the first one like I said this is
real<00:03:21.570> real<00:03:22.020> rough<00:03:22.970> not<00:03:23.970> I<00:03:24.270> don't<00:03:24.780> want<00:03:24.900> to<00:03:24.959> take

00:03:25.070 --> 00:03:25.080 
real real rough not I don't want to take

00:03:25.080 --> 00:03:29.410 
real real rough not I don't want to take
a<00:03:25.110> lot<00:03:25.350> of<00:03:25.410> time<00:03:26.000> but<00:03:27.000> now<00:03:27.239> now<00:03:27.720> that<00:03:27.780> I<00:03:27.930> have<00:03:28.230> a

00:03:29.410 --> 00:03:29.420 
a lot of time but now now that I have a

00:03:29.420 --> 00:03:32.390 
a lot of time but now now that I have a
bottom<00:03:30.420> his<00:03:30.690> bottom<00:03:30.989> jaw<00:03:31.170> and<00:03:31.440> in<00:03:31.890> this<00:03:32.160> group

00:03:32.390 --> 00:03:32.400 
bottom his bottom jaw and in this group

00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:36.830 
bottom his bottom jaw and in this group
layer<00:03:32.610> and<00:03:34.370> his<00:03:35.370> face<00:03:35.610> in<00:03:35.820> the<00:03:35.880> top<00:03:36.090> layer<00:03:36.330> now

00:03:36.830 --> 00:03:36.840 
layer and his face in the top layer now

00:03:36.840 --> 00:03:38.360 
layer and his face in the top layer now
I<00:03:36.870> can<00:03:37.170> actually<00:03:37.320> just<00:03:37.709> start<00:03:37.980> animating

00:03:38.360 --> 00:03:38.370 
I can actually just start animating

00:03:38.370 --> 00:03:41.000 
I can actually just start animating
because<00:03:39.180> there<00:03:39.480> are<00:03:39.570> separate<00:03:39.840> layers<00:03:40.080> so<00:03:40.860> if

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:41.010 
because there are separate layers so if

00:03:41.010 --> 00:03:44.720 
because there are separate layers so if
I<00:03:41.130> go<00:03:41.690> into<00:03:42.690> the<00:03:43.110> timeline<00:03:43.350> and<00:03:43.860> just<00:03:44.340> move<00:03:44.550> the

00:03:44.720 --> 00:03:44.730 
I go into the timeline and just move the

00:03:44.730 --> 00:03:51.590 
I go into the timeline and just move the
jaw<00:03:45.320> down<00:03:46.970> back<00:03:47.970> up<00:03:49.910> i'll<00:03:50.910> just<00:03:51.150> copy<00:03:51.330> i'm

00:03:51.590 --> 00:03:51.600 
jaw down back up i'll just copy i'm

00:03:51.600 --> 00:03:54.320 
jaw down back up i'll just copy i'm
going<00:03:51.720> to<00:03:51.780> copy<00:03:51.989> these<00:03:52.290> frames<00:03:52.769> and<00:03:53.330> just

00:03:54.320 --> 00:03:54.330 
going to copy these frames and just

00:03:54.330 --> 00:03:58.910 
going to copy these frames and just
paste<00:03:54.570> them<00:03:55.160> and<00:03:56.160> copy<00:03:56.519> them<00:03:56.700> again<00:03:57.920> paste

00:03:58.910 --> 00:03:58.920 
paste them and copy them again paste

00:03:58.920 --> 00:04:00.650 
paste them and copy them again paste
them<00:03:59.100> again<00:03:59.370> now<00:03:59.910> you<00:03:59.970> can<00:04:00.180> see<00:04:00.330> I<00:04:00.360> cannot

00:04:00.650 --> 00:04:00.660 
them again now you can see I cannot

00:04:00.660 --> 00:04:06.020 
them again now you can see I cannot
already<00:04:01.080> start<00:04:01.380> animating<00:04:01.680> a<00:04:02.100> mouth<00:04:02.340> and<00:04:05.030> you

00:04:06.020 --> 00:04:06.030 
already start animating a mouth and you

00:04:06.030 --> 00:04:07.790 
already start animating a mouth and you
can<00:04:06.209> go<00:04:06.330> even<00:04:06.510> further<00:04:06.810> and<00:04:07.200> make<00:04:07.470> another

00:04:07.790 --> 00:04:07.800 
can go even further and make another

00:04:07.800 --> 00:04:11.470 
can go even further and make another
group<00:04:08.190> layer<00:04:08.489> go<00:04:09.030> back<00:04:09.209> to<00:04:09.390> frame<00:04:09.600> 0<00:04:09.900> of<00:04:10.470> course

00:04:11.470 --> 00:04:11.480 
group layer go back to frame 0 of course

00:04:11.480 --> 00:04:16.300 
group layer go back to frame 0 of course
group<00:04:12.480> layer<00:04:12.780> and<00:04:13.170> say<00:04:13.380> this<00:04:13.650> is<00:04:13.709> his<00:04:14.130> head<00:04:14.489> I

00:04:16.300 --> 00:04:16.310 
group layer and say this is his head I

00:04:16.310 --> 00:04:18.380 
group layer and say this is his head I
should<00:04:17.310> be<00:04:17.430> naming<00:04:17.730> all<00:04:17.880> of<00:04:18.000> these<00:04:18.120> but<00:04:18.299> I'm

00:04:18.380 --> 00:04:18.390 
should be naming all of these but I'm

00:04:18.390 --> 00:04:20.690 
should be naming all of these but I'm
just<00:04:18.600> doing<00:04:18.870> this<00:04:18.900> really<00:04:19.260> fast<00:04:19.530> so<00:04:20.310> now<00:04:20.519> this

00:04:20.690 --> 00:04:20.700 
just doing this really fast so now this

00:04:20.700 --> 00:04:25.080 
just doing this really fast so now this
is<00:04:20.760> the<00:04:20.940> head<00:04:21.239> layer<00:04:21.890> so

00:04:25.080 --> 00:04:25.090 

00:04:25.090 --> 00:04:28.750 

I'm<00:04:26.090> going<00:04:26.510> to<00:04:26.690> select<00:04:27.100> the<00:04:28.100> jaw<00:04:28.340> and<00:04:28.640> the

00:04:28.750 --> 00:04:28.760 
I'm going to select the jaw and the

00:04:28.760 --> 00:04:31.390 
I'm going to select the jaw and the
mouth<00:04:29.030> layers<00:04:29.390> put<00:04:30.110> it<00:04:30.230> into<00:04:30.830> the<00:04:30.860> head<00:04:31.190> layer

00:04:31.390 --> 00:04:31.400 
mouth layers put it into the head layer

00:04:31.400 --> 00:04:34.270 
mouth layers put it into the head layer
the<00:04:31.880> reason<00:04:32.120> I'm<00:04:32.240> doing<00:04:32.390> this<00:04:32.540> now<00:04:32.870> is<00:04:33.170> so<00:04:33.380> even

00:04:34.270 --> 00:04:34.280 
the reason I'm doing this now is so even

00:04:34.280 --> 00:04:39.130 
the reason I'm doing this now is so even
though<00:04:34.400> I<00:04:34.430> can<00:04:36.520> animate<00:04:37.520> the<00:04:37.910> mouth<00:04:38.090> now<00:04:38.780> that

00:04:39.130 --> 00:04:39.140 
though I can animate the mouth now that

00:04:39.140 --> 00:04:41.200 
though I can animate the mouth now that
I<00:04:39.320> can<00:04:39.530> select<00:04:39.710> the<00:04:40.070> head<00:04:40.520> layer<00:04:40.700> and<00:04:41.000> do<00:04:41.180> a

00:04:41.200 --> 00:04:41.210 
I can select the head layer and do a

00:04:41.210 --> 00:04:51.450 
I can select the head layer and do a
little<00:04:41.510> bit<00:04:41.720> more<00:04:41.930> and<00:04:42.230> I<00:04:42.740> can<00:04:42.920> rotate<00:04:45.820> and

00:04:51.450 --> 00:04:51.460 

00:04:51.460 --> 00:04:56.430 

do<00:04:52.060> all<00:04:52.180> this<00:04:52.300> kind<00:04:52.539> of<00:04:52.600> other<00:04:52.780> side<00:04:54.900> so<00:04:55.900> I<00:04:56.229> hope

00:04:56.430 --> 00:04:56.440 
do all this kind of other side so I hope

00:04:56.440 --> 00:04:57.659 
do all this kind of other side so I hope
that<00:04:56.530> helps<00:04:56.680> if<00:04:57.250> you<00:04:57.400> have<00:04:57.460> any<00:04:57.639> other

00:04:57.659 --> 00:04:57.669 
that helps if you have any other

00:04:57.669 --> 00:05:01.590 
that helps if you have any other
questions<00:04:58.210> is<00:04:58.419> right<00:04:58.600> back<00:04:58.750> all<00:04:59.289> right<00:04:59.380> thank
