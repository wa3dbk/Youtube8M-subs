and the analysts and they've been

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:48.619 
and the analysts and they've been
throwing<00:00:47.190> around<00:00:47.340> Ames<00:00:47.700> like<00:00:47.940> Dustin

Byfuglien might be traded you know and
it<00:00:51.329> does<00:00:51.510> seem<00:00:51.809> like<00:00:51.840> the<00:00:52.110> Winnipeg<00:00:52.320> Jets

00:00:52.569 --> 00:00:52.579

00:00:52.579 --> 00:00:55.220 
it does seem like the Winnipeg Jets
maybe<00:00:53.579> should<00:00:53.910> do<00:00:54.059> a<00:00:54.090> rebuild<00:00:54.570> I<00:00:54.750> think<00:00:55.140> you
