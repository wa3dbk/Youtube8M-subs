00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:52.670 
but we felt by doing something digital
we<00:00:51.180> would<00:00:51.300> draw<00:00:51.690> special<00:00:52.050> attention<00:00:52.440> to<00:00:52.530> it

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:52.680 
we would draw special attention to it

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:55.069

00:01:05.090 --> 00:01:05.100 
mean it really depends on the length of

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:07.399 
mean it really depends on the length of
material<00:01:05.729> but<00:01:06.060> a<00:01:06.119> lot<00:01:06.540> of<00:01:06.630> times<00:01:06.780> the<00:01:07.020> digital

00:01:07.399 --> 00:01:07.409 
material but a lot of times the digital

one<00:01:08.010> of<00:01:08.369> the<00:01:08.460> other<00:01:08.549> things<00:01:08.610> we<00:01:09.060> want<00:01:09.299> to<00:01:09.360> do

00:01:09.469 --> 00:01:09.479 
one of the other things we want to do

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:11.179 
one of the other things we want to do
digitally<00:01:09.930> is<00:01:10.049> stuff<00:01:10.470> that<00:01:10.500> we<00:01:10.740> couldn't<00:01:11.040> do

00:01:11.179 --> 00:01:11.189 
digitally is stuff that we couldn't do

00:01:11.189 --> 00:01:14.210 
digitally is stuff that we couldn't do
in<00:01:11.369> print<00:01:11.700> right<00:01:12.060> so<00:01:12.450> doing<00:01:13.229> a<00:01:13.260> 99<00:01:13.619> cent<00:01:13.650> comics

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:16.399 
in print right so doing a 99 cent comics
very<00:01:14.430> tough<00:01:14.610> to<00:01:14.729> do<00:01:14.850> in<00:01:15.000> print<00:01:15.320> because<00:01:16.320> you're

00:01:16.399 --> 00:01:16.409 
very tough to do in print because you're

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:17.570 
very tough to do in print because you're
not<00:01:16.530> going<00:01:16.650> to<00:01:16.710> having<00:01:16.950> a<00:01:16.979> lot<00:01:17.070> of<00:01:17.100> material

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:17.580 
not going to having a lot of material

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:18.800 
not going to having a lot of material
and<00:01:17.700> the<00:01:17.759> comic<00:01:18.060> book<00:01:18.090> itself<00:01:18.420> will<00:01:18.600> be<00:01:18.659> too

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:18.810 
and the comic book itself will be too

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:20.780 
and the comic book itself will be too
thin<00:01:19.049> and<00:01:19.080> fall<00:01:19.350> over<00:01:19.590> on<00:01:19.619> the<00:01:19.799> racks<00:01:19.979> but

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:20.790 
thin and fall over on the racks but

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:22.730 
thin and fall over on the racks but
digitally<00:01:21.450> you<00:01:21.540> can<00:01:21.659> do<00:01:21.750> it<00:01:21.869> 99<00:01:22.200> cents<00:01:22.530> and<00:01:22.680> in

00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:22.740 
digitally you can do it 99 cents and in

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:24.590 
digitally you can do it 99 cents and in
fact<00:01:22.920> I<00:01:23.040> would<00:01:23.159> say<00:01:23.280> most<00:01:23.430> consumers<00:01:24.180> that<00:01:24.390> buy

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:24.600 
fact I would say most consumers that buy

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:26.450 
fact I would say most consumers that buy
things<00:01:24.900> on<00:01:25.049> their<00:01:25.200> phones<00:01:25.409> love<00:01:26.100> that<00:01:26.220> price

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:26.460 
things on their phones love that price

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:28.160 
things on their phones love that price
point<00:01:26.490> so<00:01:27.060> we<00:01:27.240> thought<00:01:27.360> hey<00:01:27.509> this<00:01:27.659> is<00:01:27.810> perfect

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:28.170 
point so we thought hey this is perfect

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:29.840 
point so we thought hey this is perfect
for<00:01:28.320> a<00:01:28.350> digital<00:01:28.500> comic<00:01:29.009> and<00:01:29.159> that's<00:01:29.549> why<00:01:29.670> we

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:29.850 
for a digital comic and that's why we

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:31.670 
for a digital comic and that's why we
went<00:01:30.119> out<00:01:30.210> there<00:01:30.299> and<00:01:30.390> did<00:01:30.479> that<00:01:30.689> all<00:01:31.560> right

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:31.680 
went out there and did that all right

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:33.140 
went out there and did that all right
we're<00:01:31.799> about<00:01:31.950> to<00:01:32.130> see<00:01:32.310> a<00:01:32.700> bunch<00:01:32.850> of<00:01:33.000> hard

00:03:05.030 --> 00:03:05.040 
third wave if we're going to be making

00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:06.920 
third wave if we're going to be making
change<00:03:05.490> of<00:03:05.610> the<00:03:05.670> third<00:03:05.850> wave<00:03:06.060> it'd<00:03:06.630> be<00:03:06.750> more

change of the third wave it'd be more

00:03:06.930 --> 00:03:08.210 
change of the third wave it'd be more
reflective<00:03:07.080> of<00:03:07.470> what<00:03:07.650> we<00:03:07.740> think<00:03:07.770> the<00:03:08.040> books

00:03:08.210 --> 00:03:08.220 
reflective of what we think the books

00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:11.000 
reflective of what we think the books
are<00:03:08.370> working<00:03:08.640> or<00:03:08.760> not<00:03:09.050> creatively<00:03:10.050> because<00:03:10.770> we

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:11.010 
are working or not creatively because we

00:03:11.010 --> 00:03:12.560 
are working or not creatively because we
have<00:03:11.100> another<00:03:11.250> series<00:03:11.730> that<00:03:11.850> have<00:03:12.000> made<00:03:12.300> some

00:03:12.560 --> 00:03:12.570 
have another series that have made some

00:03:12.570 --> 00:03:13.880 
have another series that have made some
strong<00:03:12.870> creative<00:03:13.080> changes<00:03:13.470> we<00:03:13.560> want<00:03:13.680> to<00:03:13.800> give

00:03:13.880 --> 00:03:13.890 
strong creative changes we want to give

00:03:13.890 --> 00:03:15.260 
strong creative changes we want to give
a<00:03:13.920> chance<00:03:14.070> for<00:03:14.220> them<00:03:14.430> see<00:03:14.880> if<00:03:14.940> they<00:03:15.030> can<00:03:15.180> get

00:03:15.260 --> 00:03:15.270 
a chance for them see if they can get

00:03:15.270 --> 00:03:16.880 
a chance for them see if they can get
hold<00:03:15.510> but<00:03:16.050> we<00:03:16.170> feel<00:03:16.320> if<00:03:16.440> the<00:03:16.530> books<00:03:16.739> not

00:03:16.880 --> 00:03:16.890 
hold but we feel if the books not

00:03:16.890 --> 00:03:18.680 
hold but we feel if the books not
working<00:03:17.130> creatively<00:03:17.250> all<00:03:17.700> the<00:03:17.850> sales<00:03:18.060> are<00:03:18.269> two

00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:18.690
