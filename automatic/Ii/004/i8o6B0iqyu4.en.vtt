00:02:25.319 --> 00:02:27.140 
tomorrow I would have lost some more
weight<00:02:25.380> as<00:02:25.890> she<00:02:26.130> learns<00:02:26.280> to<00:02:26.430> also<00:02:26.819> more<00:02:27.000> weight

00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:27.150

tomorrow<00:02:27.540> because<00:02:27.780> obviously<00:02:27.930> if<00:02:28.530> I<00:02:28.709> am

00:02:28.820 --> 00:02:28.830 
tomorrow because obviously if I am

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:30.740 
tomorrow because obviously if I am
burning<00:02:29.130> energy<00:02:29.459> and<00:02:29.940> i'm<00:02:30.420> not<00:02:30.600> actually

00:02:30.740 --> 00:02:30.750 
burning energy and i'm not actually

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:34.340 
burning energy and i'm not actually
eating<00:02:31.290> anything<00:02:31.560> I<00:02:32.360> actually<00:02:33.360> some<00:02:33.989> kind<00:02:34.290> of

00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:34.350 
eating anything I actually some kind of

00:02:34.350 --> 00:02:40.280 
eating anything I actually some kind of
weight<00:02:34.590> and<00:02:37.790> what<00:02:38.790> I<00:02:38.819> would<00:02:38.970> say<00:02:39.360> is<00:02:39.720> that<00:02:39.989> i

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:40.290 
weight and what I would say is that i

00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:42.920 
weight and what I would say is that i
think<00:02:40.709> this<00:02:40.980> dials<00:02:41.310> definitely<00:02:41.670> worth<00:02:41.930> doing

00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:42.930 
think this dials definitely worth doing
