00:03:57.190 --> 00:03:57.200 
more clear and I removed the skin a

00:03:57.200 --> 00:04:00.599 
more clear and I removed the skin a
little<00:03:57.440> bit<00:03:57.560> but<00:03:58.099> I<00:03:58.750> started<00:03:59.750> to<00:03:59.930> notice<00:04:00.079> that

00:04:00.599 --> 00:04:00.609 
little bit but I started to notice that

00:04:00.609 --> 00:04:02.470 
little bit but I started to notice that
some<00:04:01.609> of<00:04:01.639> the<00:04:01.910> roots

00:04:02.470 --> 00:04:02.480 
some of the roots

00:04:02.480 --> 00:04:06.490 
some of the roots
we're<00:04:03.139> actually<00:04:03.680> attached<00:04:04.280> to<00:04:04.879> the<00:04:05.209> skin<00:04:05.720> so<00:04:06.260> I

we're actually attached to the skin so I

00:04:06.500 --> 00:04:09.430 
we're actually attached to the skin so I
think<00:04:06.739> it<00:04:06.889> is<00:04:07.040> feeding<00:04:07.790> from<00:04:08.720> the<00:04:08.870> skin<00:04:09.230> so<00:04:09.410> I

00:04:09.430 --> 00:04:09.440 
think it is feeding from the skin so I

00:04:09.440 --> 00:04:13.720 
think it is feeding from the skin so I
didn't<00:04:09.769> want<00:04:09.980> it<00:04:10.099> to<00:04:11.109> remove<00:04:12.109> the<00:04:13.099> skins<00:04:13.459> that

00:04:15.580 --> 00:04:15.590 
were attached to some of the roots so I

00:04:15.590 --> 00:04:20.009 
were attached to some of the roots so I
just<00:04:15.949> removed<00:04:16.599> the<00:04:17.599> top<00:04:18.440> of<00:04:18.769> the<00:04:19.160> avocado<00:04:19.280> and

but the top hasn't grown much and that

00:05:34.770 --> 00:05:38.890 
but the top hasn't grown much and that
is<00:05:35.300> partly<00:05:36.300> my<00:05:36.420> fault<00:05:36.630> because<00:05:37.020> I<00:05:37.440> was<00:05:38.070> using

00:05:38.890 --> 00:05:38.900 
is partly my fault because I was using

00:05:38.900 --> 00:05:42.380 
is partly my fault because I was using
tap<00:05:39.900> water<00:05:39.930> and<00:05:40.920> the<00:05:41.130> tablet<00:05:41.610> was<00:05:41.820> really

00:05:42.380 --> 00:05:42.390 
tap water and the tablet was really

00:05:42.390 --> 00:05:47.920 
tap water and the tablet was really
heavy<00:05:42.690> and<00:05:43.130> it<00:05:44.840> left<00:05:45.840> a<00:05:46.140> white<00:05:46.890> powdery

00:05:47.920 --> 00:05:47.930 
heavy and it left a white powdery

00:05:47.930 --> 00:05:49.490 
heavy and it left a white powdery
substance

00:05:49.490 --> 00:05:49.500 
substance

00:05:49.500 --> 00:05:53.060 
substance
maybe<00:05:49.890> it's<00:05:50.250> calcium<00:05:50.640> or<00:05:51.210> salt<00:05:51.510> on<00:05:51.750> the<00:05:52.710> little

00:05:53.060 --> 00:05:53.070 
maybe it's calcium or salt on the little

00:05:53.070 --> 00:05:53.570 
maybe it's calcium or salt on the little
avocado

00:05:53.570 --> 00:05:53.580 
avocado

00:05:53.580 --> 00:05:56.390 
avocado
spouse<00:05:54.000> and<00:05:54.300> so<00:05:54.810> that<00:05:54.990> stunt<00:05:55.530> the<00:05:55.950> growth<00:05:55.980> a

00:05:56.390 --> 00:05:56.400 
spouse and so that stunt the growth a

00:05:56.400 --> 00:05:59.420 
spouse and so that stunt the growth a
little<00:05:56.580> bit<00:05:56.850> so<00:05:57.000> I<00:05:57.030> suggest<00:05:57.540> not<00:05:57.720> to<00:05:57.990> use<00:05:58.430> tap

00:05:59.420 --> 00:05:59.430 
little bit so I suggest not to use tap

00:05:59.430 --> 00:06:01.460 
little bit so I suggest not to use tap
water<00:05:59.460> at<00:05:59.820> all<00:06:00.000> maybe<00:06:00.330> spring<00:06:01.140> water<00:06:01.350> or

00:06:01.460 --> 00:06:01.470 
water at all maybe spring water or

00:06:01.470 --> 00:06:04.520 
water at all maybe spring water or
distilled<00:06:01.950> water<00:06:02.400> or<00:06:02.840> rain<00:06:03.840> water<00:06:03.870> or<00:06:04.380> even

00:06:04.520 --> 00:06:04.530 
distilled water or rain water or even

00:06:04.530 --> 00:06:09.560 
distilled water or rain water or even
snow<00:06:05.400> water<00:06:06.360> then<00:06:07.050> that<00:06:07.590> I<00:06:07.620> used<00:06:08.070> so<00:06:09.030> I<00:06:09.060> changed

00:06:09.560 --> 00:06:09.570 
snow water then that I used so I changed

00:06:09.570 --> 00:06:14.810 
snow water then that I used so I changed
the<00:06:09.720> water<00:06:09.870> and<00:06:10.700> and<00:06:11.810> I<00:06:12.810> am<00:06:13.440> going<00:06:13.710> to<00:06:13.830> grow

00:06:14.810 --> 00:06:14.820 
the water and and I am going to grow

00:06:14.820 --> 00:06:17.840 
the water and and I am going to grow
this<00:06:15.200> apparently<00:06:16.200> because<00:06:17.160> I<00:06:17.370> already<00:06:17.520> has<00:06:17.820> a

00:06:17.840 --> 00:06:17.850 
this apparently because I already has a

00:06:17.850 --> 00:06:21.790 
this apparently because I already has a
root<00:06:18.180> and<00:06:18.390> it<00:06:18.540> is<00:06:18.660> look<00:06:19.140> at<00:06:19.230> this<00:06:19.400> compared<00:06:20.400> to

00:06:21.790 --> 00:06:21.800 
root and it is look at this compared to

00:06:21.800 --> 00:06:27.250 
root and it is look at this compared to
the<00:06:22.800> size<00:06:23.100> of<00:06:24.650> my<00:06:25.650> two<00:06:25.710> small<00:06:25.980> avocado<00:06:26.400> this<00:06:26.940> is

00:06:27.250 --> 00:06:27.260 
the size of my two small avocado this is

00:06:27.260 --> 00:06:29.420 
the size of my two small avocado this is
humongous<00:06:28.260> and<00:06:28.440> it's<00:06:28.680> going<00:06:28.830> to<00:06:28.980> get<00:06:29.100> a<00:06:29.160> lot

00:06:29.420 --> 00:06:29.430 
humongous and it's going to get a lot

00:06:29.430 --> 00:06:33.230 
humongous and it's going to get a lot
bigger<00:06:29.640> once<00:06:30.630> it<00:06:30.870> soaks<00:06:31.080> up<00:06:31.380> the<00:06:31.590> water<00:06:32.240> these

00:06:33.230 --> 00:06:33.240 
bigger once it soaks up the water these

00:06:33.240 --> 00:06:36.950 
bigger once it soaks up the water these
-<00:06:33.570> avocados<00:06:33.690> bar<00:06:34.410> the<00:06:35.280> land<00:06:36.030> ha<00:06:36.330> they're

00:06:36.950 --> 00:06:36.960 
- avocados bar the land ha they're

00:06:36.960 --> 00:06:38.210 
- avocados bar the land ha they're
different<00:06:37.200> from<00:06:37.530> the<00:06:37.650> Haas

00:06:38.210 --> 00:06:38.220 
different from the Haas

00:06:38.220 --> 00:06:40.250 
different from the Haas
they<00:06:38.670> are<00:06:38.820> the<00:06:39.000> lamphouse<00:06:39.330> so<00:06:39.810> their<00:06:40.020> seeds

00:06:40.250 --> 00:06:40.260 
they are the lamphouse so their seeds

00:06:40.260 --> 00:06:42.800 
they are the lamphouse so their seeds
are<00:06:40.440> a<00:06:40.470> lot<00:06:40.590> smaller<00:06:40.830> but<00:06:41.160> the<00:06:41.430> plant<00:06:42.330> itself

00:06:42.800 --> 00:06:42.810 
are a lot smaller but the plant itself

00:06:42.810 --> 00:06:46.460 
are a lot smaller but the plant itself
is<00:06:43.170> supposedly<00:06:44.130> a<00:06:44.610> lot<00:06:44.970> harder<00:06:45.510> so<00:06:46.230> if<00:06:46.290> you're

00:06:46.460 --> 00:06:46.470 
is supposedly a lot harder so if you're

00:06:46.470 --> 00:06:49.370 
is supposedly a lot harder so if you're
in<00:06:46.650> the<00:06:46.800> northern<00:06:47.070> region<00:06:47.640> you<00:06:48.390> can<00:06:48.600> grow<00:06:48.900> lamp

00:06:49.370 --> 00:06:49.380 
in the northern region you can grow lamp

00:06:49.380 --> 00:06:52.850 
in the northern region you can grow lamp
off<00:06:49.620> energy<00:06:50.070> honestly<00:06:50.790> a<00:06:51.170> much<00:06:52.170> harder<00:06:52.650> year

00:06:52.850 --> 00:06:52.860 
off energy honestly a much harder year

00:06:52.860 --> 00:06:57.710 
off energy honestly a much harder year
variety<00:06:53.550> than<00:06:54.390> other<00:06:54.750> avocados<00:06:55.620> and<00:06:56.600> but<00:06:57.600> look

00:06:57.710 --> 00:06:57.720 
variety than other avocados and but look

00:06:57.720 --> 00:06:59.670 
variety than other avocados and but look
at<00:06:57.870> that<00:06:58.020> check<00:06:58.740> that<00:06:59.040> out

00:06:59.670 --> 00:06:59.680 
at that check that out

00:06:59.680 --> 00:07:01.950 
at that check that out
check<00:06:59.830> out<00:06:59.979> the<00:07:00.130> roots<00:07:00.340> that<00:07:00.520> are<00:07:00.960> growing

00:07:01.950 --> 00:07:01.960 
check out the roots that are growing

00:07:01.960 --> 00:07:03.719 
check out the roots that are growing
already<00:07:02.380> that's<00:07:02.590> just<00:07:02.770> amazing

00:07:03.719 --> 00:07:03.729 
already that's just amazing

00:07:03.729 --> 00:07:07.170 
already that's just amazing
so<00:07:04.300> I<00:07:04.330> will<00:07:04.840> grow<00:07:05.380> this<00:07:05.919> in<00:07:06.430> a<00:07:06.460> container<00:07:07.000> if

00:07:07.170 --> 00:07:07.180 
so I will grow this in a container if

00:07:07.180 --> 00:07:08.999 
so I will grow this in a container if
I'm<00:07:07.270> not<00:07:07.419> very<00:07:07.570> patient<00:07:07.870> with<00:07:08.169> avocado<00:07:08.710> but<00:07:08.979> I

00:07:08.999 --> 00:07:09.009 
I'm not very patient with avocado but I

00:07:09.009 --> 00:07:10.260 
I'm not very patient with avocado but I
will<00:07:09.250> give<00:07:09.430> it<00:07:09.550> a<00:07:09.610> try

00:07:10.260 --> 00:07:10.270 
will give it a try

00:07:10.270 --> 00:07:13.740 
will give it a try
talk<00:07:10.780> to<00:07:10.930> you<00:07:11.050> guys<00:07:11.139> later<00:07:11.380> bye
