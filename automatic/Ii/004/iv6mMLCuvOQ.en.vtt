00:00:06.299 --> 00:00:11.650
 Huawei has since this month a very 

00:00:08.590 --> 00:00:12.759
 interesting telephone at the honor 6 

00:00:11.650 --> 00:00:14.769
 they want to offer an alternative 

00:00:12.759 --> 00:00:16.960
 for the most expensive smartphones from 

00:00:14.769 --> 00:00:18.910
 this costs me 300 euros 

00:00:16.960 --> 00:00:20.380
 it in between demands on paper specifications 

00:00:18.910 --> 00:00:22.450
 that you expect new top model from 

00:00:20.380 --> 00:00:25.320
 for example samsung but he has so 

00:00:22.450 --> 00:00:25.320
 the price of the middle class 

00:00:28.600 --> 00:00:32.200
 the design of the honor 6 is not very good 

00:00:30.460 --> 00:00:33.460
 special looks like a mix of others 

00:00:32.200 --> 00:00:34.990
 smartphones 

00:00:33.460 --> 00:00:37.360
 so the rounded corners have something away 

00:00:34.990 --> 00:00:40.150
 from the iphone 5s and does the edge 

00:00:37.360 --> 00:00:41.920
 think of the sony xperia z2 

00:00:40.150 --> 00:00:43.870
 the screen edges are small making it 

00:00:41.920 --> 00:00:45.280
 device is still compact and there are none 

00:00:43.870 --> 00:00:47.079
 sharp edges that make the device 

00:00:45.280 --> 00:00:48.850
 fits comfortably in your hand 

00:00:47.079 --> 00:00:51.750
 the device is also wonderfully light and 

00:00:48.850 --> 00:00:51.750
 weighs only 130 grams 

00:00:52.150 --> 00:00:57.610
 the device has a nice 5 inch full 

00:00:54.010 --> 00:00:59.950
 hd screen with 445 pixels per inch is it 

00:00:57.610 --> 00:01:01.810
 screen very sharp and even sharper than 

00:00:59.950 --> 00:01:05.229
 many a top smartphone such as the samsung 

00:01:01.810 --> 00:01:06.909
 galaxy s5 and the iphone 6 

00:01:05.229 --> 00:01:09.760
 the screen is beautiful and realistic 

00:01:06.909 --> 00:01:11.650
 colors but your eyes are a little cool 

00:01:09.760 --> 00:01:13.510
 you can happily adjust this yourself with 

00:01:11.650 --> 00:01:15.040
 the color temperature 

00:01:13.510 --> 00:01:16.870
 the viewing angle and the contrast are good 

00:01:15.040 --> 00:01:18.370
 but not as good as that of others 

00:01:16.870 --> 00:01:20.049
 smartphones 

00:01:18.370 --> 00:01:23.490
 the screen is pretty clear and that 

00:01:20.049 --> 00:01:23.490
 helps again with reading in sunlight 

00:01:23.550 --> 00:01:27.600
 Underneath the screen is a very fast one 

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:30.480
 processor so-called picks a core 

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:31.500
 processor with 4 powerful calculation cores 

00:01:30.480 --> 00:01:33.120
 as my heavy duty 

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:36.150
 carried out and also 4 energy efficient 

00:01:33.120 --> 00:01:37.500
 calculation cores and they work as 

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:39.960
 you famous only go my text message 

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:41.970
 Steer that way is your battery 

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:42.780
 saved but the device is very bad 

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:44.910
 fast 

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:46.950
 you do not suffer from hitches apps 

00:01:44.910 --> 00:01:49.010
 open quickly and multitask none 

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:49.010
 issue 

00:01:49.260 --> 00:01:54.270
 the cameras have a 13 megapixel camera with 

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:56.790
 double LED flash auto focus and hdr 

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:58.260
 possibility and photos are rich 

00:01:56.790 --> 00:01:59.640
 to detail and to the good ones 

00:01:58.260 --> 00:02:02.010
 lighting conditions will be beautiful 

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:04.350
 Unrolling images really seems like one 

00:02:02.010 --> 00:02:06.000
 light in the camera or is it dark 

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:08.280
 the camera performs less well and go 

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:10.170
 the cameras lost details 

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:13.200
 top smartphones perform on those points 

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:13.770
 much better but for the price of 300 

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:16.610
 euros 

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:16.610
 this is just a great camera 

00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:20.130
 The minus about 6 is that it is 

00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:22.070
 device not on android 4 point four 

00:02:20.130 --> 00:02:24.060
 only runs on four point four point two 

00:02:22.070 --> 00:02:26.520
 He now also has Google Android 

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:29.459
 500 released and probably to 

00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:30.870
 this version also to the honor 6 

00:02:29.459 --> 00:02:33.270
 the painter is over it too 

00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:35.010
 noted it is a good looking and 

00:02:33.270 --> 00:02:36.270
 user-friendly skin 

00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:38.520
 because institutions are logically arranged 

00:02:36.270 --> 00:02:40.140
 And there are countless options around you 

00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:41.910
 device 

00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:43.739
 do miss the button on the device for all 

00:02:41.910 --> 00:02:45.540
 your apps and all apps that are installed 

00:02:43.739 --> 00:02:49.980
 end up on the different 

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:52.470
 Home screens under 6 has a very 

00:02:49.980 --> 00:02:53.790
 large battery of 3100 i amps 

00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:56.040
 but you can't get it out of the phone 

00:02:53.790 --> 00:02:58.110
 pick up how we we say ourselves 

00:02:56.040 --> 00:03:00.480
 with normal use about 2 days with that 

00:02:58.110 --> 00:03:02.100
 battery does but with intensive use 

00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:03.209
 we rather think of a day or 

00:03:02.100 --> 00:03:07.520
 day and a half as realistic 

00:03:03.209 --> 00:03:10.230
 usage time but that is also very good 

00:03:07.520 --> 00:03:10.920
 the honor 6 offers top performance for one 

00:03:10.230 --> 00:03:12.780
 fair price 

00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:15.480
 at the moment you can only access it 

00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:17.280
 buy bol.com for 300 euros 

00:03:15.480 --> 00:03:19.950
 do not want to touch the pocket too deeply 

00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:21.360
 then the honor 6 is an excellent deal 

00:03:19.950 --> 00:03:23.190
 top smartphones still offer it 

00:03:21.360 --> 00:03:25.980
 best of the best but with this device 

00:03:23.190 --> 00:03:27.600
 will certainly entertain you 

00:03:25.980 --> 00:03:28.440
 you want to know everything about this and others 

00:03:27.600 --> 00:03:31.370

00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:31.370
