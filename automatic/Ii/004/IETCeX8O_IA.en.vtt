00:00:01.379 --> 00:00:04.379
 TV broadcast is partly made possible by van CZ 

00:00:05.150 --> 00:00:07.270
 in addition 

00:00:07.270 --> 00:00:11.880
 all commitment as gatekeeper technicians, he is a smartlapt choir institute 

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:15.360
 Tuesday because the parquet sends Mitchell the Japanese Suzuki strike 

00:00:18.650 --> 00:00:20.060
 little different 

00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:23.060
 destiny experience 

00:00:31.749 --> 00:00:35.710
 that comes with had of course we are going to talk about the problem this week 

00:00:35.710 --> 00:00:38.340
 around the intel sandy bridge platform 

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:41.740
 we have very special TV of no less than 7,000 euros 

00:00:41.740 --> 00:00:45.230
 We start with the new trainer being used digital SLR 

00:00:45.230 --> 00:00:46.420
 photo camera 

00:00:46.420 --> 00:00:49.800
 for recording video my head does not like a colleague eric van 

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:50.499
 burgundy 

00:00:50.499 --> 00:00:53.389
 After a few years ago you probably didn't realize that 

00:00:53.389 --> 00:00:56.920
 anyone who is a little serious about kospi land is busy with that 

00:00:56.920 --> 00:00:59.979
 here and that nowadays we film with the name and slr cameras 

00:00:59.979 --> 00:01:03.010
 did not use the video card at the umpteenth time in the car 

00:01:03.009 --> 00:01:04.040
 if offered i mean 

00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:07.070
 these types of devices are useful for taking photos 

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:10.910
 but indeed didierdidier who those filmmakers who do you have something justice 

00:01:10.909 --> 00:01:13.229
 could not be found with video cameras 

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:16.130
 yes and that has everything to do with depth of field sharpness doesn't say much 

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:19.649
 about things that are close by and both have a sharp focus there is another big one 

00:01:19.649 --> 00:01:23.850
 depth of field or that just a point stronger the spanish union film 

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:25.920
 losing says sharper to the background 

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:28.890
 he shows himself that is basically filmmakers want because then 

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:29.810
 can you do the 

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:33.579
 the audience can oblige you to look at a certain subject 

00:01:33.579 --> 00:01:37.649
 yes there is the attention to draw therefore not everyone who this 

00:01:37.649 --> 00:01:40.830
 not the mobile unit went there to operate but also pay close attention 

00:01:40.829 --> 00:01:41.800
 the film 

00:01:41.800 --> 00:01:43.370
 to make matters worse 

00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:47.280
 its character the characters what the talking is generally very 

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:50.920
 sharp and the rest of mind and weapons, however, is the basis and nice but 

00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:54.270
 you have to look at that person he has everything to do with the big catch 

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:57.190
 and we will again be dealing with aperture settings that have a technical failure 

00:01:57.190 --> 00:02:00.380
 but the horse actually comes down to is that how small the sensor, how big the 

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:02.289
 depth of field so a very small center 

00:02:02.289 --> 00:02:05.169
 like everything from start to finish snipers for the consumer market 

00:02:05.169 --> 00:02:08.470
 ideal because you just get yourself and the baby is filming 

00:02:08.470 --> 00:02:12.190
 the teacher did not think about it now I have a stork sharp or 11 cm 

00:02:12.190 --> 00:02:14.249
 or they get it 

00:02:14.249 --> 00:02:18.430
 and, for the sake of clarity, in and out of a compact photo camera 

00:02:18.429 --> 00:02:19.269
 everything 

00:02:19.269 --> 00:02:23.209
 Just before the future with Digid is obvion that sitting is so small and there 

00:02:23.209 --> 00:02:26.799
 It has been a long time since they are sure that is smaller than this one 

00:02:26.799 --> 00:02:28.489
 door a bit much smaller 

00:02:28.489 --> 00:02:32.269
 that's the device a little big sensor we have four models here 

00:02:32.269 --> 00:02:35.760
 of knowledge of a show full of strange if we want to say I am 35 50 

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:38.340
 36 millimeters wide and others here for three hours 

00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:43.129
 they are after psv sensors that are 22 millimeters wide that is all and right huge 

00:02:43.129 --> 00:02:46.590
 much larger than the numbers that are found in normal compact cameras, yes 

00:02:46.590 --> 00:02:49.160
 And the advantage of that is that you definitely like it when you have a fun race 

00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:52.120
 she used is very nice with depth of field can play yes what had 

00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:55.100
 can prevent with photos the purpose there is the headline figured out yes 

00:02:55.100 --> 00:02:58.479
 before that played to ensure that they go to water 

00:02:58.479 --> 00:03:02.059
 in the zoo static the penguin to pay attention and well now 

00:03:02.059 --> 00:03:04.709
 by now, according to journalists portrait stand here a lot of the cheap 

00:03:04.709 --> 00:03:08.129
 This competition then ensures that no animals are known for it soon 

00:03:08.129 --> 00:03:09.950
 sharper and behind a nice but moderate 

00:03:09.950 --> 00:03:12.319
 of course you can also set all manually 

00:03:12.319 --> 00:03:15.559
 And the other benefit of and there will be video is that and then you should if I have to 

00:03:15.559 --> 00:03:18.669
 well at saying that if you good match even less sensitive person that 

00:03:18.669 --> 00:03:22.019
 can also be super good with a dark film you have a lot of good light sensitivity and 

00:03:22.019 --> 00:03:24.930
 yes that is with the with most consumer camcorders not it either 

00:03:24.930 --> 00:03:25.719
 case 

00:03:25.719 --> 00:03:27.510
 but why 

00:03:27.510 --> 00:03:30.510
 then that a lot of people now use this, it is the sls 

00:03:31.069 --> 00:03:33.109
 mainly a lot cheaper than 

00:03:33.109 --> 00:03:34.909
 video cameras would not think so 

00:03:34.909 --> 00:03:37.569
 we have been and that is a little understand its actually little video 

00:03:37.569 --> 00:03:40.790
 camera seldom shoots that did pay attention to the nex vg10 a while ago 

00:03:40.790 --> 00:03:43.429
 from sony also becomes a psv film camera 

00:03:43.429 --> 00:03:46.189
 but there was again the problem that you have few but new settings 

00:03:46.189 --> 00:03:49.659
 suicide is the device you can pretty much set 4 and 

00:03:49.659 --> 00:03:52.999
 the point is that of course also just a very good photo camera so much 

00:03:52.999 --> 00:03:56.569
 People buy it for when most families also got it to be commercial 

00:03:56.569 --> 00:03:59.050
 for example with these types of cameras nowadays being shot because 

00:03:59.050 --> 00:04:02.480
 the alternative that they are actually very expensive professional cameras through the 

00:04:02.480 --> 00:04:05.190
 youth, that is not the case, but it was a lot of sense to cry 

00:04:05.190 --> 00:04:09.270
 of the pain still to book many thousands of hundreds of thousands of euros and still 

00:04:09.270 --> 00:04:11.800
 much expensive would like the ret cameras to be made for films 

00:04:11.800 --> 00:04:15.260
 If you have a complete set of cheaper loans there is negotiable 

00:04:15.260 --> 00:04:17.820
 You are here there are some models of Kenneth Starr can not 

00:04:17.820 --> 00:04:21.329
 that he fifty members 7days stb and the 5d mark 2 

00:04:21.329 --> 00:04:25.639
 after benefit for the bonus manifestations of a small 700 euros to reactor one 

00:04:25.639 --> 00:04:29.509
 fat 2010 look only so can me go crazy can you still easily rarely 

00:04:29.509 --> 00:04:33.780
 bump into the dibi field that cheapest that 5 15 demo crimes that 

00:04:33.780 --> 00:04:36.809
 the cheapest knowing and screenwriter can now video 

00:04:36.809 --> 00:04:40.709
 even that I can so in that regard video can actually be no for this kind 

00:04:40.709 --> 00:04:44.929
 effect is more alarming than that more affordable video camera than that to cluster 

00:04:44.929 --> 00:04:47.839
 depth of field anyway an ode to the sensitivity of the judgment of the 

00:04:47.839 --> 00:04:49.180
 Swedish bank seb as good as 

00:04:49.180 --> 00:04:53.030
 and these three people in the prices and robberies in addition to the pvv 

00:04:53.030 --> 00:04:55.699
 fifteen hundred euros saved by a factor of two difference is m 

00:04:55.699 --> 00:05:01.069
 the chord is so different this these two meters and westbork this magnesium 

00:05:01.069 --> 00:05:05.469
 and this room much faster than the two york where videos and these 3 actually 

00:05:05.469 --> 00:05:08.710
 more or less equal to clean up the bub setting options on the 

00:05:08.710 --> 00:05:10.919
 This world has its best 

00:05:10.919 --> 00:05:14.499
 but I am sixty you than I think the self-expressed cameramen in between 

00:05:14.499 --> 00:05:17.440
 them at the moment because that is the only one with a screen if you can 

00:05:17.440 --> 00:05:20.700
 it is possible to rotate with video that is ideal because you have to be on your screen 

00:05:20.700 --> 00:05:22.229
 watch as you record videos 

00:05:22.229 --> 00:05:25.800
 yes and keep this choice on zoom only and still look good on the screen if you 

00:05:25.800 --> 00:05:28.969
 hold above you which can also be useful and still see the screen well 

00:05:28.969 --> 00:05:32.379
 none of those have greece here 

00:05:32.379 --> 00:05:35.669
 That is the most important thing that drives tickets are that we are the largest 

00:05:35.669 --> 00:05:37.979
 Census can automatically take the most 

00:05:37.979 --> 00:05:40.509
 the study is for that matter feel how 

00:05:40.509 --> 00:05:43.689
 Of course I hope for a quality that he is the best 

00:05:43.689 --> 00:05:44.900
 just a few hours before 

00:05:44.900 --> 00:05:48.670
 on the other hand reconnaissance tip line also as one as a balm the as one as one 

00:05:48.669 --> 00:05:52.000
 surprise that people are going to use a camera for and 

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:53.340
 yes i have a little bit 

00:05:53.340 --> 00:05:56.780
 how would we try to help those opponents think a little bit? 

00:05:56.780 --> 00:06:00.760
 So it was one of the first cameras from the list for the vvd and apparently one of the first 

00:06:00.760 --> 00:06:04.070
 people really top sport still come out for the video option but he comes 

00:06:04.070 --> 00:06:05.349
 not so much experience free 

00:06:05.349 --> 00:06:09.240
 Concrete support was given and Stern has released some further and there are 

00:06:09.240 --> 00:06:12.180
 also a kind of hit company with which even more newspaper 

00:06:12.180 --> 00:06:16.120
 but sees duijts and actually the first generation sls with videos that 

00:06:16.120 --> 00:06:18.439
 let's just go a little bit with your whining 

00:06:18.439 --> 00:06:21.919
 next generations will of course watch more video fun shopping years 

00:06:21.919 --> 00:06:25.009
 the practices of the suburb do not do it much for those who do have one 

00:06:25.009 --> 00:06:28.440
 a duration of the panic mood of connecting but 

00:06:28.440 --> 00:06:31.810
 also the strengths in advance strong students we are not that great so those are 

00:06:31.810 --> 00:06:34.980
 things that will undoubtedly change, yes, among the younger generations 

00:06:34.980 --> 00:06:39.200
 Great opportunities to sleep can make a new live announce that it is still watching 

00:06:39.200 --> 00:06:40.490
 thought better about it 

00:06:40.490 --> 00:06:45.009
 The only goal that these devices make them look like is the other of Fortis 

00:06:45.009 --> 00:06:47.650
 thought how to hold it more conveniently for the stable 

00:06:47.650 --> 00:06:51.420
 this is not directly the ideal for social purpose to shoot 2 and 

00:06:51.419 --> 00:06:54.520
 whatever should say none of these cameras and as thanks and things are too 

00:06:54.520 --> 00:06:57.910
 a16 could, but none of these rooms could film it like that 

00:06:57.910 --> 00:06:59.259
 and therefore not always manually 

00:06:59.259 --> 00:07:00.300
 according to do 

00:07:00.300 --> 00:07:03.630
 that is a drawback but that as a real form factor is just not ideal for that 

00:07:03.629 --> 00:07:06.539
 video and yes there are all companies that jump there again because you 

00:07:06.539 --> 00:07:07.029
 is possible 

00:07:07.029 --> 00:07:09.909
 complete range sale because they mount the device on the shoulder 

00:07:09.909 --> 00:07:13.199
 under a glacier at 5 0 as you see, the best is also one 

00:07:13.199 --> 00:07:16.599
 sharp pins a movie that can still see what is on your screen 

00:07:16.599 --> 00:07:19.889
 happened yes and for this week the site would be pretty simple but the 

00:07:19.889 --> 00:07:22.619
 starting days at a few hundred euros you can still save a few thousand 

00:07:22.619 --> 00:07:23.719
 break it up 

00:07:23.719 --> 00:07:27.049
 yes if you do not give it that expensive they make up and for clarity this 

00:07:27.049 --> 00:07:29.610
 is really no joke at his own home 

00:07:29.610 --> 00:07:33.949
 recorded tv commercials from which I am tired of being with you 

00:07:33.949 --> 00:07:37.660
 If you like arthouse movies this is all happening right now with this 

00:07:37.659 --> 00:07:40.840
 kind of camera yes it is crazy not yet they still have real hobby atmosphere because there is 

00:07:40.840 --> 00:07:42.610
 only have limitations 

00:07:42.610 --> 00:07:45.909
 but out of thousands per kilometer per hour at the place of opportunity
