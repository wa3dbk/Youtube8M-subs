00:00:01.939 --> 00:00:06.180
 A super athlete should be as easy as 

00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:08.820
 to be possible 

00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:11.580
 That's why McLaren's engineers targeted 

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:14.599
 a few small bumps of the 650 it 

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:16.139
 the result of the abspeckkur is the 

00:00:14.599 --> 00:00:19.980
 675 lt 

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:23.279
 It weighs 100 kilos less than the 1429 

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:28.529
 kilo light 650 it and brings 

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:31.109
 additional 25 ps the body of the 675th 

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:33.600
 lt is off the b should be completely off 

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:35.489
 carbon the exhaust of the optional 

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:38.280
 roll bar and even the wheel bolts 

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:40.350
 made of titanium the upper wishbones 

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:41.399
 aluminum the rear window 

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:43.469
 polycarbonate 

00:00:41.399 --> 00:00:45.329
 even the rather break so the 

00:00:43.469 --> 00:00:46.890
 rear wing drs with my brakes off 

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:49.680
 high speeds in the wind 

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:53.100
 places where easier though he and 50 

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:55.350
 percent larger fails than the 650 it 

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:57.870
 the big root is at the same time 

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:59.940
 name long tail call him the 

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:05.040
 short technician 

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:07.229
 t with finished 1330 kilo buzzing mclarens 

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:09.680
 top model like a go kart over the grand 

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:12.720
 prix course of silverstone the 

00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:15.210
 standard semi slicks show as well 

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:17.759
 like the ceramic brakes round by round 

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:19.920
 an unshakeable stamina 

00:01:17.759 --> 00:01:22.049
 the enormous grip of the sport should mature 

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:24.899
 give the driver the necessary confidence 

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:28.649
 to protect oneself in the border areas 

00:01:24.899 --> 00:01:32.850
 from the 650 it known 3 8 liter v8 with 

00:01:28.649 --> 00:01:35.369
 turbocharging makes the lte 6175 ps 

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:37.649
 the maximum torque is included 

00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:40.950
 smooth 700 newton meters 

00:01:37.649 --> 00:01:45.420
 the 675 lte accelerates from the stand 

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:48.060
 according to mclaren in 219 1 100 at the spurt of 

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:48.990
 0 to 200 pass only 7.9 

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:51.530
 seconds 

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:55.530
 The controlled dive ends at 

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:57.929
 330 hours kilometers with which the 675 lt 

00:01:55.530 --> 00:02:01.229
 an hour-kilometer is faster than 

00:01:57.929 --> 00:02:03.750
 the 650 it despite this race car 

00:02:01.229 --> 00:02:05.520
 The landing gear should also be on the 

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:07.979
 road be very sensitive 

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:09.869
 Hardly any other supercar should 

00:02:07.979 --> 00:02:12.030
 such a good suspension comfort 

00:02:09.869 --> 00:02:14.849
 offer is also fast on the 

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:19.230
 race track good manners on the street 

00:02:14.849 --> 00:02:21.690
 in the price of 300 9750 euro plays 

00:02:19.230 --> 00:02:26.900
 actually no role because the pad 

00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:26.900
 sold out of 500 copies long ago
