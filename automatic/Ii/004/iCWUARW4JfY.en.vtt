00:00:09.890 --> 00:00:13.910
 emotion on the bench after being 

00:00:12.020 --> 00:00:16.400
 replaced javier 'chicharito' hernández 

00:00:13.910 --> 00:00:19.160

 to be able to collaborate again with a goal 

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:28.490

00:00:40.550 --> 00:00:44.359
 opportunities had to come not 

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:46.010
