00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.400
 Here's how to get your bathroom in order. 

00:00:02.669 --> 00:00:11.969
 and renovated gives a new look 

00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:14.309
 amaro antiguinho o and scenery I already in 

00:00:11.969 --> 00:00:16.560
 champion long ago with the paper contact 

00:00:14.309 --> 00:00:19.710
 it was all white 

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:23.279
 only that the accident that drugs home and 

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:26.130
 last drawer and a drawer that had 

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:30.869
 this mark this was no more 

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:32.910
 drawer where the drawer here in the background I 

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:34.680
 I used Styrofoam to interrupt a contact 

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:35.910
 to give the impression that the 

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:40.140
 no way 

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:43.739
 I used paper contact stylus pen 

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:47.760
 I took measurements one centimeter and one 

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:50.129
 Styrofoam and only for it is fine but it is super 

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:52.500
 Sturdy I've used it before 

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:55.579
 cut to make the markings and zopone 

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:59.250
 cut with the pope with the stylus 

00:00:55.579 --> 00:01:02.789
 the contact from the back already has the 

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:07.619
 stripes it's easy to take the measurements now 

00:01:02.789 --> 00:01:09.570
 to paste the contact paper in styrofoam here 

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:12.090
 I'll show you the technique to 

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:13.770
 paste the contact without bubbles is going 

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:17.310
 serve for all other times 

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:20.009
 you apply paper contact and do 

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:22.110
 this double in the film behind 

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:24.450
 then start applying 

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:29.909
 or ruler or picks up a tissue from the 

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:33.600
 fabric that has remained a bubble will hit the 

00:01:29.909 --> 00:01:37.979
 hand to this bubble of trois right there 

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:41.820
 How I'm doing now and going with the 

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:49.250
 rule help is getting neighbor has 

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:52.380
 no bubble is as it has already been applied to 

00:01:49.250 --> 00:01:55.189
 I've already cut the side 

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:58.369
 measure and in the same way to apply 

00:01:55.189 --> 00:02:00.360
 It's just a little bit of the film behind. 

00:01:58.369 --> 00:02:03.619
 It's going bad 

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:03.619
 the side 

00:02:10.760 --> 00:02:25.250
 by hand and pulling the 

00:02:15.960 --> 00:02:25.250
 total of 31 a new face 

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:35.790
 there is take away access will continue law 

00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:40.730
 be careful not to ruin the paper 

00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:40.730
 contact that has already pasted on the right side 

00:02:41.870 --> 00:02:44.870
 caution 

00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:52.430
 ready 

00:02:52.980 --> 00:03:07.280
 the bottom of the ruler had not 

00:03:02.730 --> 00:03:09.870
 also only taking the excess always makes the 

00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:11.640
 cut to size a little bigger there 

00:03:09.870 --> 00:03:13.650
 you take away the excess you make 

00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:16.790
 measure is in danger of becoming 

00:03:13.650 --> 00:03:21.750
 little as it turned out 

00:03:16.790 --> 00:03:24.480
 I took it and checkmark pasted and any 

00:03:21.750 --> 00:03:25.920
 a holder for the hair dryer one 

00:03:24.480 --> 00:03:32.480
 also the underside of the 

00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:32.480
 hooded and was a nice way 

00:03:34.960 --> 00:03:40.900
 it's in that little box 

00:03:38.230 --> 00:03:45.010
 I put the little pots that I take in 

00:03:40.900 --> 00:03:48.280
 travel shampoo swab toothbrush 

00:03:45.010 --> 00:03:53.410
 So instead of the drawer I left this 

00:03:48.280 --> 00:03:56.610
 little box with pots the first 

00:03:53.410 --> 00:04:01.600
 drawer I decided to make a partition with 

00:03:56.610 --> 00:04:04.000
 ops in kp a double sided tape 

00:04:01.600 --> 00:04:11.500
 and I only had the wide one but then I cut it there 

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:16.380
 in the middle it became thin and 

00:04:11.500 --> 00:04:16.380
 with the double-sided tape 

00:04:23.220 --> 00:04:29.850
 there, just fit 

00:04:26.280 --> 00:04:31.880
 and she is super tough this tape a lot 

00:04:29.850 --> 00:04:34.950
 good 

00:04:31.880 --> 00:04:38.490
 on one side I put soap with the 

00:04:34.950 --> 00:04:42.180
 things other tooth brush toothpaste 

00:04:38.490 --> 00:04:44.520
 fundamental reserve for not 

00:04:42.180 --> 00:04:47.910
 mix because the smell of the soap 

00:04:44.520 --> 00:04:54.500
 to avoid contact with the 

00:04:47.910 --> 00:04:54.500
 easter with cute brush 

00:04:54.870 --> 00:05:02.370
 The second time I did not partition 

00:04:56.850 --> 00:05:05.190
 But we'll organize it here. 

00:05:02.370 --> 00:05:07.080
 a box to store the 

00:05:05.190 --> 00:05:08.550
 absorbent material that is cold in the 

00:05:07.080 --> 00:05:11.150
 saving money in the box is not 

00:05:08.550 --> 00:05:11.150
 scattered 

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:16.200
