Apple now I was 8.2 also carries into

Apple now I was 8.2 also carries into
the<00:02:28.850> system<00:02:29.270> optimization<00:02:29.660> so<00:02:30.440> especially<00:02:30.710> on

00:02:30.940 --> 00:02:30.950 
the system optimization so especially on

00:02:30.950 --> 00:02:33.370 
the system optimization so especially on
older<00:02:31.310> devices<00:02:31.340> you'll<00:02:32.270> notice<00:02:32.720> that<00:02:32.960> the

00:02:33.370 --> 00:02:33.380 
older devices you'll notice that the

00:02:33.380 --> 00:02:35.530 
older devices you'll notice that the
system<00:02:33.650> takes<00:02:34.430> less<00:02:34.820> memory<00:02:35.330> or<00:02:35.510> the

00:02:35.530 --> 00:02:35.540 
system takes less memory or the

00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:38.140 
system takes less memory or the
operating<00:02:36.380> system<00:02:36.650> takes<00:02:36.830> less<00:02:37.160> memory<00:02:37.670> to

operating system takes less memory to
install<00:02:38.480> on<00:02:38.630> your<00:02:38.660> device<00:02:39.020> so<00:02:39.290> you'll<00:02:39.410> have

00:02:39.580 --> 00:02:39.590 
install on your device so you'll have

00:02:39.590 --> 00:02:41.410 
install on your device so you'll have
more<00:02:39.800> free<00:02:40.070> memory<00:02:40.250> for<00:02:40.580> music<00:02:40.940> for<00:02:41.150> videos
