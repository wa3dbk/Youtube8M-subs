00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.470
 To be hello and welcome 

00:00:02.370 --> 00:00:08.690
 I turn my keyboard in a jiffy 

00:00:04.470 --> 00:00:14.790
 even you need vacuum cleaner 

00:00:08.690 --> 00:00:17.640
 screwdriver detergent and a 

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:21.830
 rags best with cotton underpants 

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:25.529
 an old best on would have washed 

00:00:21.830 --> 00:00:27.779
 whether you have a gaming keyboard or 

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:29.250
 a normal keyboard has the 

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:31.859
 Cleaning is pretty much always the way 

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:33.870
 same in this video we work 

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:36.390
 only on the front keyboard 

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:38.480
 and open the device does not lead 

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:41.309
 namely to extinguish the guarantee 

00:00:38.480 --> 00:00:43.320
 Let's start with step 1 power 

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:44.910
 you s.besten a photo of abo keyboard 

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:46.430
 and later again all keys in the 

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:49.110
 hide correct position 

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:51.090
 step number 2 and offers you that 

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:52.640
 her everything has sink vacuum cleaner 

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:56.160
 screwdrivers and the rag 

00:00:52.640 --> 00:00:57.719
 step number three forget the 

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:58.949
 keyboard to stick out or the 

00:00:57.719 --> 00:01:00.870
 exclude batteries 

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:03.270
 For this model must be here 

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:04.309
 see and of course the usb plug 

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:07.680
 pull 

00:01:04.309 --> 00:01:09.000
 Step 4 now opens the 

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:11.909
 different buttons with the 

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:12.540
 screwdrivers start here and pull 

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:15.299
 up 

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:17.759
 It's easy if you do not want to 

00:01:15.299 --> 00:01:19.229
 your keyboard will scratch you if you could 

00:01:17.759 --> 00:01:22.049
 wrap in the rag and 

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:25.920
 screwdriver and thus damaged 

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:27.180
 not you are the best way to work that way 

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:28.880
 slowly upwards 

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:32.790
 until you get the complete keyboard 

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:34.860
 has liberated special keys for me 

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:36.689
 the screwdriver amec proves its worth 

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:37.220
 press the button and then up 

00:01:36.689 --> 00:01:41.520
 to do 

00:01:37.220 --> 00:01:43.470
 so this is very simple from step 

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:45.689
 number five the keyboard operates completely 

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:47.060
 open it carefully if you do not break it 

00:01:45.689 --> 00:01:49.409
 make but only clean 

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:52.439
 Step 6, the suction of the 

00:01:49.409 --> 00:01:54.090
 keyboard you know eventual cola right 

00:01:52.439 --> 00:01:56.369
 are not to be found with me 

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:59.040
 but here you can with a wet 

00:01:56.369 --> 00:02:01.710
 rag and some detergent folding tables 

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:04.829
 otherwise it is completely enough in the 

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:07.320
 Vacuum cleaner over to say I have one 

00:02:04.829 --> 00:02:08.819
 Keyboard now completely sucked it out 

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:10.530
 but still the cola 

00:02:08.819 --> 00:02:11.160
 right and different crumbs is not 

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:13.230
 cancel 

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:16.380
 I'm going with a wet 

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:17.580
 rag and some detergent last around 

00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:19.500
 the coal rights also completely 

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:22.230
 got away with me one 

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:24.570
 Toothbrush worth the conti everywhere 

00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:26.480
 and just need something boston best 

00:02:24.570 --> 00:02:29.610
 Are not you taking your current one? 

00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:31.110
 If that has done so far then take care 

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:33.540
 The keyboard again and she must 

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:35.490
 then so be to the actual 

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:36.900
 let that could with a damp 

00:02:35.490 --> 00:02:38.730
 Wipe cloth and then 

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:40.170
 let dry when dry where 

00:02:38.730 --> 00:02:43.950
 Just put it back in the keyboard 

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:46.130
 One step number eight buttons 

00:02:43.950 --> 00:02:48.180
 after they are dry reinstall 

00:02:46.130 --> 00:02:50.100
 while you help your photo he 

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:51.840
 Of course you have done with it 

00:02:50.100 --> 00:02:54.390
 know where the keys again accordingly 

00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:56.370
 otherwise look for you in the 

00:02:54.390 --> 00:02:58.230
 home another keyboard or google 

00:02:56.370 --> 00:03:02.760
 The whole thing just with a cell phone too 

00:02:58.230 --> 00:03:04.350
 Handy have questions like the end 

00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:06.420
 I keep my keyboard still 

00:03:04.350 --> 00:03:08.520
 Just wear one in front of it 

00:03:06.420 --> 00:03:12.330
 wash and not ponder so much 

00:03:08.520 --> 00:03:14.700
 which chips and cakes or how many times 

00:03:12.330 --> 00:03:18.330
 i should give my keyboard some once 

00:03:14.700 --> 00:03:21.270
 in the year should be enough yes that's it 

00:03:18.330 --> 00:03:24.360
 I hope it was fun when I 

00:03:21.270 --> 00:03:26.280
 I wish you much fun cleaning there 

00:03:24.360 --> 00:03:28.410
 Certainly some of you are heinis 

00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:30.480
 you forgot to take a picture 

00:03:28.410 --> 00:03:33.080
 that's why I let it happen 

00:03:30.480 --> 00:03:35.280
 again so you can pass the video 

00:03:33.080 --> 00:03:37.910
 and then I have the corresponding button 

00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:37.910
 where they go
