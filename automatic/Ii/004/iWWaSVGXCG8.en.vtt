00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:47.610 
sonic things that we could fool around

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:49.850 
sonic things that we could fool around
with<00:01:48.000> and<00:01:48.210> have<00:01:48.330> fun<00:01:48.570> with<00:01:48.840> playing<00:01:49.680> the

you<00:02:01.170> saxophone<00:02:01.740> teachers<00:02:02.159> will<00:02:02.340> probably

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:02.820 
you saxophone teachers will probably

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:04.520 
you saxophone teachers will probably
know<00:02:03.000> exactly<00:02:03.450> what<00:02:03.600> I'm<00:02:03.720> talking<00:02:03.750> about<00:02:04.140> like

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:04.530

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:07.160 
know exactly what I'm talking about like
a<00:02:04.560> lot<00:02:04.770> of<00:02:04.950> times<00:02:05.159> people<00:02:05.400> will<00:02:06.020> turn<00:02:07.020> the

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:07.170 
a lot of times people will turn the

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:09.259 
a lot of times people will turn the
saxophone<00:02:07.759> incorrectly<00:02:08.759> because<00:02:08.970> the

00:02:09.259 --> 00:02:09.269 
saxophone incorrectly because the

00:02:09.269 --> 00:02:11.840 
saxophone incorrectly because the
saxophone<00:02:09.750> goes<00:02:10.050> in<00:02:10.379> the<00:02:10.500> mouth

00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:11.850 
saxophone goes in the mouth

00:02:11.850 --> 00:02:13.700 
saxophone goes in the mouth
straight<00:02:12.510> as<00:02:12.750> opposed<00:02:13.170> to<00:02:13.350> a<00:02:13.380> clam

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:13.710 
straight as opposed to a clam

00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:16.670 
straight as opposed to a clam
which<00:02:14.130> is<00:02:14.310> like<00:02:14.670> this<00:02:14.970> and<00:02:15.330> so<00:02:15.720> Clara<00:02:16.500> dead

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:16.680 
which is like this and so Clara dead

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:19.570 
which is like this and so Clara dead
guys<00:02:16.890> usually<00:02:17.190> don't<00:02:17.490> have<00:02:17.730> the<00:02:17.970> problem<00:02:18.390> of

overt onion sciatic I had a friend of
mine<00:02:32.070> in<00:02:32.310> high<00:02:32.430> school<00:02:32.700> used<00:02:32.820> to<00:02:33.000> do<00:02:33.150> that<00:02:33.300> all

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:33.450

mine in high school used to do that all
the<00:02:33.480> time<00:02:33.600> and<00:02:34.430> coincidentally<00:02:35.430> that's<00:02:35.790> how<00:02:35.940> I

00:02:35.960 --> 00:02:35.970 
the time and coincidentally that's how I

00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:37.430 
the time and coincidentally that's how I
actually<00:02:36.210> learned<00:02:36.630> how<00:02:36.720> to<00:02:36.840> slap<00:02:37.110> done

00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:37.440 
actually learned how to slap done

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:38.510 
actually learned how to slap done
because<00:02:37.620> I<00:02:37.680> used<00:02:37.860> to<00:02:37.920> make<00:02:38.100> fun<00:02:38.310> of<00:02:38.340> the<00:02:38.490> way

00:02:38.510 --> 00:02:38.520

00:02:45.740 --> 00:02:45.750 
teacher I'd sit there two of us guys

00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:49.490 
teacher I'd sit there two of us guys
actually<00:02:46.080> doing<00:02:46.470> that<00:02:46.710> stuff<00:02:47.070> but<00:02:47.820> I<00:02:48.500> learned

00:02:49.490 --> 00:02:49.500 
actually doing that stuff but I learned

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:53.210 
actually doing that stuff but I learned
by<00:02:50.310> doing<00:02:50.340> that<00:02:51.170> that<00:02:52.170> if<00:02:52.530> you<00:02:52.770> don't<00:02:53.010> allow

00:02:53.210 --> 00:02:53.220 
by doing that that if you don't allow

00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:58.520 
by doing that that if you don't allow
the<00:02:53.280> air<00:02:53.930> to<00:02:54.930> pass<00:02:55.170> through<00:02:55.590> the<00:02:55.770> saxophone<00:02:57.530> so

00:02:58.520 --> 00:02:58.530 
the air to pass through the saxophone so

00:02:58.530 --> 00:03:00.140 
the air to pass through the saxophone so
that<00:02:58.710> the<00:02:58.830> reed<00:02:59.040> vibrates<00:02:59.070> you<00:03:00.000> could

00:03:00.140 --> 00:03:00.150 
that the reed vibrates you could

00:03:00.150 --> 00:03:13.640 
that the reed vibrates you could
actually<00:03:00.360> make<00:03:00.690> make<00:03:01.050> the<00:03:01.200> reed<00:03:01.380> slap<00:03:12.650> not

00:03:13.640 --> 00:03:13.650 
actually make make the reed slap not

00:03:13.650 --> 00:03:15.380 
actually make make the reed slap not
allowing<00:03:14.010> the<00:03:14.130> air<00:03:14.280> to<00:03:14.310> come<00:03:14.760> over<00:03:14.970> telling

00:03:15.380 --> 00:03:15.390 
allowing the air to come over telling

00:03:15.390 --> 00:03:17.480 
allowing the air to come over telling
