00:01:31.260 --> 00:01:31.270 
wolverine he had to put on a lot of

00:01:31.270 --> 00:01:33.389 
wolverine he had to put on a lot of
prosthetics<00:01:31.840> but<00:01:32.020> he<00:01:32.770> did<00:01:32.950> play<00:01:33.039> the<00:01:33.190> blog

00:01:33.389 --> 00:01:33.399 
prosthetics but he did play the blog

00:01:33.399 --> 00:01:35.400 
prosthetics but he did play the blog
he's<00:01:33.670> pretty<00:01:33.880> big<00:01:34.090> guy<00:01:34.330> I<00:01:34.630> think<00:01:35.050> he's<00:01:35.170> over

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:35.410 
he's pretty big guy I think he's over

00:01:35.410 --> 00:01:38.520 
he's pretty big guy I think he's over
six<00:01:35.440> foot<00:01:35.860> six<00:01:36.190> something<00:01:36.640> and<00:01:37.259> probably<00:01:38.259> over

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:38.530 
six foot six something and probably over

00:01:38.530 --> 00:01:40.109 
six foot six something and probably over
200<00:01:38.679> pounds<00:01:38.979> so<00:01:39.220> that's<00:01:39.340> pretty<00:01:39.520> cool<00:01:39.610> or

00:01:40.109 --> 00:01:40.119 
200 pounds so that's pretty cool or

00:01:40.119 --> 00:01:42.930 
200 pounds so that's pretty cool or
somewhere<00:01:40.450> around<00:01:40.509> there<00:01:40.720> anyway<00:01:41.020> so<00:01:41.940> he

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:42.940 
somewhere around there anyway so he

00:01:42.940 --> 00:01:44.760 
somewhere around there anyway so he
definitely<00:01:43.060> has<00:01:43.390> the<00:01:43.420> physical<00:01:43.750> prowess<00:01:44.349> and

00:01:44.760 --> 00:01:44.770 
definitely has the physical prowess and

00:01:44.770 --> 00:01:46.620

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:18.430 
comedy in the joking part is more

00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:22.589 
comedy in the joking part is more
important<00:02:19.030> than<00:02:19.780> the<00:02:20.640> physicality<00:02:21.640> part<00:02:22.209> so

00:02:22.589 --> 00:02:22.599 
important than the physicality part so

00:02:22.599 --> 00:02:25.380 
important than the physicality part so
even<00:02:23.349> though<00:02:23.379> Kevin<00:02:24.340> Duran<00:02:24.610> looks<00:02:25.030> the<00:02:25.239> part

00:02:25.380 --> 00:02:25.390 
even though Kevin Duran looks the part

00:02:25.390 --> 00:02:27.210 
even though Kevin Duran looks the part
looks<00:02:25.690> very<00:02:26.020> close<00:02:26.260> to<00:02:26.440> negan<00:02:26.739> and<00:02:26.920> I<00:02:26.980> would<00:02:27.129> be

00:02:27.210 --> 00:02:27.220

yeah i think evan is a great choice but

00:03:40.930 --> 00:03:42.810 
yeah i think evan is a great choice but
the<00:03:41.590> comedy<00:03:42.010> side<00:03:42.160> of<00:03:42.340> it<00:03:42.430> I'm<00:03:42.550> a<00:03:42.580> little

00:03:42.810 --> 00:03:42.820 
the comedy side of it I'm a little

00:03:42.820 --> 00:03:44.850 
the comedy side of it I'm a little
worried<00:03:43.060> about<00:03:43.210> so<00:03:43.510> because<00:03:44.260> i<00:03:44.350> haven't<00:03:44.530> seen

00:03:44.850 --> 00:03:44.860 
worried about so because i haven't seen

00:03:44.860 --> 00:03:47.280 
worried about so because i haven't seen
Kevin<00:03:45.400> in<00:03:45.580> a<00:03:45.670> role<00:03:45.880> where<00:03:46.090> he's<00:03:46.300> you<00:03:46.660> know<00:03:46.690> in<00:03:47.020> a

00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:47.290 
Kevin in a role where he's you know in a

00:03:47.290 --> 00:03:50.580 
Kevin in a role where he's you know in a
comedy<00:03:47.740> type<00:03:47.980> roles<00:03:48.310> so<00:03:49.020> negan<00:03:50.020> is<00:03:50.080> a<00:03:50.170> tough<00:03:50.380> a

00:03:50.580 --> 00:03:50.590 
comedy type roles so negan is a tough a

00:03:50.590 --> 00:03:52.770 
comedy type roles so negan is a tough a
tough<00:03:50.790> character<00:03:51.790> to<00:03:52.000> cast<00:03:52.270> for<00:03:52.600> I<00:03:52.630> think

00:03:52.770 --> 00:03:52.780 
tough character to cast for I think

00:03:52.780 --> 00:03:55.170 
tough character to cast for I think
because<00:03:53.320> he's<00:03:54.070> one<00:03:54.400> that<00:03:54.580> you<00:03:54.670> have<00:03:54.850> to<00:03:55.030> have

00:03:55.170 --> 00:03:55.180 
because he's one that you have to have

00:03:55.180 --> 00:03:57.090 
because he's one that you have to have
those<00:03:55.390> two<00:03:55.630> sides<00:03:55.930> to<00:03:56.350> them<00:03:56.560> you<00:03:56.710> got<00:03:56.890> to<00:03:56.980> have

00:03:57.090 --> 00:03:57.100 
those two sides to them you got to have

00:03:57.100 --> 00:03:59.790 
those two sides to them you got to have
that<00:03:57.180> intimidating<00:03:58.180> physical<00:03:58.660> leader<00:03:59.320> type

00:03:59.790 --> 00:03:59.800 
that intimidating physical leader type

00:03:59.800 --> 00:04:01.560 
that intimidating physical leader type
side<00:04:00.100> then<00:04:00.610> you<00:04:00.730> have<00:04:00.850> to<00:04:01.000> have<00:04:01.120> the<00:04:01.300> joking

00:04:01.560 --> 00:04:01.570 
side then you have to have the joking

00:04:01.570 --> 00:04:05.250 
side then you have to have the joking
funny<00:04:02.050> a<00:04:02.350> black<00:04:02.890> humor<00:04:03.580> dark<00:04:03.910> humor<00:04:04.360> type<00:04:04.930> side

00:04:05.250 --> 00:04:05.260 
funny a black humor dark humor type side

00:04:05.260 --> 00:04:09.660 
funny a black humor dark humor type side
as<00:04:05.560> well<00:04:05.800> too<00:04:06.220> so<00:04:06.580> um<00:04:06.990> yeah<00:04:07.990> I<00:04:08.020> mean<00:04:08.410> not<00:04:09.400> a<00:04:09.430> bad

00:04:09.670 --> 00:04:11.040 
as well too so um yeah I mean not a bad

this<00:04:37.630> one<00:04:37.810> not<00:04:37.990> a<00:04:38.020> bad<00:04:38.230> choice<00:04:38.440> but<00:04:39.370> I<00:04:39.400> think

00:04:39.720 --> 00:04:39.730 
this one not a bad choice but I think

00:04:39.730 --> 00:04:41.490 
this one not a bad choice but I think
maybe<00:04:40.270> we<00:04:40.510> could<00:04:40.660> get<00:04:40.780> a<00:04:41.020> better<00:04:41.170> choice<00:04:41.440> i

00:04:41.490 --> 00:04:41.500 
maybe we could get a better choice i

00:04:41.500 --> 00:04:42.540 
maybe we could get a better choice i
think<00:04:41.740> there's<00:04:41.860> better<00:04:42.010> choices<00:04:42.250> out<00:04:42.520> there

00:04:42.540 --> 00:04:42.550 
think there's better choices out there

think there's better choices out there
so<00:04:43.000> if<00:04:43.540> you<00:04:43.690> want<00:04:43.840> to<00:04:43.870> see<00:04:44.020> who<00:04:44.200> watch<00:04:44.560> my<00:04:44.770> video
