00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:28.300 
pretty certain that those were fathered

00:02:28.300 --> 00:02:33.780 
pretty certain that those were fathered
by<00:02:29.459> the<00:02:30.750> double<00:02:31.750> Hetal<00:02:32.140> otherwise<00:02:32.860> they<00:02:33.640> would

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:33.790 
by the double Hetal otherwise they would

00:02:33.790 --> 00:02:37.470 
by the double Hetal otherwise they would
have<00:02:33.820> ended<00:02:34.060> up<00:02:34.150> being<00:02:34.360> cinnamons<00:02:36.300> so<00:02:37.300> what
