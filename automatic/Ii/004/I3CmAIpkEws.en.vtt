00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.770
 this we see in the bike more 

00:00:01.800 --> 00:00:08.550
 light of the cannon of the supersix ad 

00:00:04.770 --> 00:00:11.160
 high module in black ink version as well 

00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:12.960
 as he had mounted on and around 

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:16.170
 six pounds the weight of the bicycle 

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:18.150
 whole is not just the best frame 

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:21.390
 of cannon del but also what 

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:24.840
 uses a carbon from the module 

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:28.560
 very different from the high modulus 

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:31.460
 standard in quotes but with a type 

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:35.160
 carbon that has 

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:36.090
 nanotechnology to be to train i 

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:39.120
 tubes 

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:45.330
 this allows to contain the weight of the 

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:46.739
 finished frame at 650 670 grams depending 

00:00:45.330 --> 00:00:49.830
 the extent that we 

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:52.800
 tried for example is a 52 of the gods 

00:00:49.830 --> 00:00:54.660
 eight measures produced the details 

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:57.390
 the technological ones are the typical ones 

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:59.430
 of the supersix hm model 

00:00:57.390 --> 00:01:01.680
 then the head tube by a thumb a 

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:04.680
 eighth and a half inch maybe it's the 

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:06.930
 full carbon furka with fork tips 

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:09.570
 also made of carbon dig at 

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:12.510
 bb30 movement that in this case so 

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:15.720
 as on all the supersix and very high 

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:18.360
 range mounts a crankset that does not come from 

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:20.430
 oil graham sls l2 

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:22.500
 with this spider structure that is 

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:24.350
 really very light 

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:27.270
 the advantage of this bicycle 

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:32.850
 particular is unique for this version 

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:34.890
 for the supersix hm black ink combines a 

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:37.649
 complete mechanical shimano group where 

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:41.130
 he lived at 11 exclusive speeds 

00:01:37.649 --> 00:01:45.380
 wheels in medium profile for tubular 

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:46.850
 with chris king hubs 

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:48.890
 scorrevolissimi 

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:53.119
 really efficient even from the point of 

00:01:48.890 --> 00:01:55.250
 view of durability andy mark 

00:01:53.119 --> 00:01:57.530
 American that in this case provides the 

00:01:55.250 --> 00:02:03.140
 circuses here 

00:01:57.530 --> 00:02:06.920
 also provides for the 27.2 mm bed 

00:02:03.140 --> 00:02:10.039
 to the driving group with stem 

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:12.950
 with this very massive and curved shape 

00:02:10.039 --> 00:02:15.470
 from the compact morphology both in 

00:02:12.950 --> 00:02:21.489
 carbon whole bike price as well 

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:21.489
 as we see without the pedals 10,999 euros
