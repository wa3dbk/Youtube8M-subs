00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:29.170 
it a very kind of ethereal quality or
didn't<00:02:28.040> sound<00:02:28.190> like<00:02:28.250> it<00:02:28.370> was<00:02:28.459> in<00:02:28.580> a<00:02:28.670> big<00:02:28.879> hall

00:02:29.170 --> 00:02:29.180 
didn't sound like it was in a big hall

00:02:29.180 --> 00:03:01.650 
didn't sound like it was in a big hall
and<00:02:29.450> I'm<00:02:29.540> gonna<00:02:29.660> play<00:02:29.900> a<00:02:29.930> little<00:02:30.019> bit<00:02:30.440> drier

00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:01.660 

00:03:01.660 --> 00:03:04.300 

and<00:03:02.660> then<00:03:02.780> I<00:03:02.810> came<00:03:02.870> in<00:03:03.020> dried<00:03:03.770> up<00:03:03.920> a<00:03:04.010> little<00:03:04.190> bit

00:03:04.300 --> 00:03:04.310 
and then I came in dried up a little bit

00:03:04.310 --> 00:03:05.470 
and then I came in dried up a little bit
more<00:03:04.459> now<00:03:04.610> again<00:03:04.850> you're<00:03:05.030> probably<00:03:05.180> there's

00:03:05.470 --> 00:03:05.480 
more now again you're probably there's

00:03:05.480 --> 00:03:06.640 
more now again you're probably there's
some<00:03:05.510> distortion<00:03:06.080> here<00:03:06.200> because<00:03:06.410> I'm<00:03:06.470> really

00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:06.650 
some distortion here because I'm really

00:03:06.650 --> 00:03:07.660 
some distortion here because I'm really
gonna<00:03:06.770> kind<00:03:06.980> of<00:03:07.010> push<00:03:07.190> it<00:03:07.310> a<00:03:07.370> little<00:03:07.400> bit

00:03:07.660 --> 00:03:07.670 
gonna kind of push it a little bit

00:03:07.670 --> 00:03:09.310 
gonna kind of push it a little bit
harder<00:03:07.970> the<00:03:08.270> distortion<00:03:08.810> is<00:03:08.930> not<00:03:09.140> on<00:03:09.260> the

00:03:09.310 --> 00:03:09.320 
harder the distortion is not on the

00:03:09.320 --> 00:03:10.930 
harder the distortion is not on the
piano<00:03:09.650> itself<00:03:09.950> the<00:03:10.130> distortion<00:03:10.610> is<00:03:10.700> because

00:03:10.930 --> 00:03:10.940 
piano itself the distortion is because

00:03:10.940 --> 00:03:13.330 
piano itself the distortion is because
I'm<00:03:11.030> recording<00:03:11.420> on<00:03:11.510> an<00:03:11.630> iPad<00:03:12.050> and<00:03:12.500> I<00:03:13.040> really

00:03:13.330 --> 00:03:13.340 
I'm recording on an iPad and I really

00:03:13.340 --> 00:03:38.710 
I'm recording on an iPad and I really
can't<00:03:13.580> handle<00:03:13.850> that<00:03:14.120> so

00:03:38.710 --> 00:03:38.720 

00:03:38.720 --> 00:03:41.330 

so<00:03:39.720> you<00:03:39.810> get<00:03:39.900> the<00:03:40.020> idea<00:03:40.080> again<00:03:40.770> an<00:03:40.980> instrument

00:03:41.330 --> 00:03:41.340 
so you get the idea again an instrument

00:03:41.340 --> 00:03:42.950 
so you get the idea again an instrument
that<00:03:41.400> I<00:03:41.460> really<00:03:41.970> really<00:03:42.180> enjoy<00:03:42.210> playing<00:03:42.690> a

00:03:42.950 --> 00:03:42.960 
that I really really enjoy playing a

00:03:42.960 --> 00:03:45.380 
that I really really enjoy playing a
great<00:03:43.170> deal<00:03:43.410> one<00:03:44.340> that<00:03:44.490> I'd<00:03:44.580> love<00:03:44.790> to<00:03:44.940> own<00:03:45.090> but

00:03:45.380 --> 00:03:45.390 
great deal one that I'd love to own but

00:03:45.390 --> 00:03:47.060 
great deal one that I'd love to own but
frankly<00:03:45.810> I<00:03:45.870> have<00:03:46.020> seven<00:03:46.320> pianos<00:03:46.650> in<00:03:46.770> my<00:03:46.860> house

00:03:47.060 --> 00:03:47.070 
frankly I have seven pianos in my house

00:03:47.070 --> 00:03:48.470 
frankly I have seven pianos in my house
and<00:03:47.250> my<00:03:47.370> wife<00:03:47.550> wants<00:03:47.790> me<00:03:47.850> to<00:03:47.910> get<00:03:48.060> rid<00:03:48.210> of<00:03:48.270> some

00:03:48.470 --> 00:03:48.480 
and my wife wants me to get rid of some

00:03:48.480 --> 00:03:50.540 
and my wife wants me to get rid of some
of<00:03:48.510> them<00:03:48.690> so<00:03:48.930> this<00:03:49.470> one<00:03:49.680> I<00:03:49.710> think<00:03:49.890> I'd<00:03:50.190> love<00:03:50.370> for

00:03:50.540 --> 00:03:50.550 
of them so this one I think I'd love for

00:03:50.550 --> 00:03:51.800 
of them so this one I think I'd love for
a<00:03:50.610> number<00:03:50.880> of<00:03:50.910> reasons<00:03:51.090> when<00:03:51.420> it's<00:03:51.570> very

00:03:51.800 --> 00:03:51.810 
a number of reasons when it's very

00:03:51.810 --> 00:03:54.770 
a number of reasons when it's very
responsive<00:03:52.490> -<00:03:53.490> you<00:03:53.640> can<00:03:53.790> record<00:03:54.210> on<00:03:54.450> it<00:03:54.600> and

00:03:54.770 --> 00:03:54.780 
responsive - you can record on it and

00:03:54.780 --> 00:03:56.900 
responsive - you can record on it and
use<00:03:54.900> all<00:03:55.170> these<00:03:55.380> sounds<00:03:55.980> that<00:03:56.010> come<00:03:56.400> with<00:03:56.760> the

00:03:56.900 --> 00:03:56.910 
use all these sounds that come with the

00:03:56.910 --> 00:03:58.790 
use all these sounds that come with the
instrument<00:03:57.360> over<00:03:57.480> 700<00:03:57.990> sounds<00:03:58.320> in<00:03:58.440> here<00:03:58.620> all

00:03:58.790 --> 00:03:58.800 
instrument over 700 sounds in here all

00:03:58.800 --> 00:04:00.830 
instrument over 700 sounds in here all
together<00:03:58.890> and<00:03:59.430> then<00:04:00.030> I'm<00:04:00.210> also<00:04:00.480> another

00:04:00.830 --> 00:04:00.840 
together and then I'm also another

00:04:00.840 --> 00:04:02.150 
together and then I'm also another
reason<00:04:01.080> why<00:04:01.320> I<00:04:01.350> would<00:04:01.560> really<00:04:01.740> love<00:04:01.950> it<00:04:02.070> is

00:04:02.150 --> 00:04:02.160 
reason why I would really love it is

00:04:02.160 --> 00:04:04.430 
reason why I would really love it is
that<00:04:02.340> it<00:04:02.400> has<00:04:02.460> the<00:04:02.670> headphone<00:04:03.090> jacks<00:04:03.570> so

00:04:04.430 --> 00:04:04.440 
that it has the headphone jacks so

00:04:04.440 --> 00:04:06.230 
that it has the headphone jacks so
there's<00:04:04.710> two<00:04:04.950> actual<00:04:05.460> headphone<00:04:05.790> jacks<00:04:06.090> that

00:04:06.230 --> 00:04:06.240 
there's two actual headphone jacks that

00:04:06.240 --> 00:04:07.910 
there's two actual headphone jacks that
you<00:04:06.420> could<00:04:06.600> use<00:04:06.750> for<00:04:06.780> a<00:04:06.990> teaching<00:04:07.290> situation

00:04:07.910 --> 00:04:07.920 
you could use for a teaching situation

00:04:07.920 --> 00:04:10.040 
you could use for a teaching situation
or<00:04:08.070> just<00:04:08.250> to<00:04:08.340> practice<00:04:08.760> alone<00:04:09.060> silently

00:04:10.040 --> 00:04:10.050 
or just to practice alone silently

00:04:10.050 --> 00:04:11.930 
or just to practice alone silently
