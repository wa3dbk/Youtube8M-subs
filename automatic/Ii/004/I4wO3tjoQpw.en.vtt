before<00:00:12.150> we<00:00:12.300> begin<00:00:12.630> I<00:00:12.900> suggest<00:00:13.799> that<00:00:13.920> you<00:00:14.099> watch

00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:14.250 
before we begin I suggest that you watch

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:17.359 
before we begin I suggest that you watch
my<00:00:14.549> first<00:00:14.820> video<00:00:15.210> on<00:00:15.680> how<00:00:16.680> to<00:00:16.710> make<00:00:16.920> a<00:00:17.100> heat

00:00:17.359 --> 00:00:17.369 
my first video on how to make a heat

00:00:17.369 --> 00:00:20.960 
my first video on how to make a heat
exchanger<00:00:17.940> I<00:00:18.529> will<00:00:19.529> be<00:00:19.650> skipping<00:00:20.310> a<00:00:20.490> few<00:00:20.640> steps

00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:20.970 
exchanger I will be skipping a few steps

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:24.740 
exchanger I will be skipping a few steps
in<00:00:21.210> this<00:00:21.420> video<00:00:22.519> basically<00:00:23.519> do<00:00:24.000> a<00:00:24.029> time<00:00:24.420> if<00:00:24.689> you

00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:24.750 
in this video basically do a time if you

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:26.779 
in this video basically do a time if you
want<00:00:25.080> to<00:00:25.350> learn<00:00:25.470> how<00:00:25.710> to<00:00:25.740> prepare<00:00:26.220> the<00:00:26.369> copper

00:00:26.779 --> 00:00:26.789 
want to learn how to prepare the copper

since<00:01:14.610> we're<00:01:14.850> dealing<00:01:15.060> with<00:01:15.240> domestic

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:15.900 
since we're dealing with domestic

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:19.640 
since we're dealing with domestic
pressure<00:01:16.170> this<00:01:16.409> is<00:01:16.470> type<00:01:16.799> M<00:01:17.070> and<00:01:18.259> this<00:01:19.259> is<00:01:19.439> type

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:19.650 
pressure this is type M and this is type

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:24.140 
pressure this is type M and this is type
M<00:01:19.860> also<00:01:20.280> now<00:01:21.270> see<00:01:21.630> that<00:01:21.840> edge<00:01:22.880> stamped<00:01:23.880> around

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:24.150 
M also now see that edge stamped around

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:26.420 
M also now see that edge stamped around
the<00:01:24.360> middle<00:01:24.630> of<00:01:24.840> the<00:01:25.049> bushing<00:01:25.500> we<00:01:26.130> need<00:01:26.310> to

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:26.430 
the middle of the bushing we need to

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:29.240 
the middle of the bushing we need to
remove<00:01:26.729> that<00:01:27.030> we<00:01:27.479> do<00:01:27.630> that<00:01:27.869> by<00:01:28.110> using<00:01:28.140> a<00:01:28.680> dremel

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:29.250 
remove that we do that by using a dremel

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:40.080 
remove that we do that by using a dremel
tool<00:01:29.720> this

00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:40.090 

00:01:40.090 --> 00:01:51.700 

you

00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:51.710 

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:53.899 

so<00:01:52.710> you<00:01:52.799> know<00:01:52.950> I<00:01:52.979> don't<00:01:53.189> know<00:01:53.369> if<00:01:53.460> you<00:01:53.520> can<00:01:53.700> see

00:01:53.899 --> 00:01:53.909 
so you know I don't know if you can see

00:01:53.909 --> 00:01:59.660 
so you know I don't know if you can see
the<00:01:54.090> inside<00:01:54.600> of<00:01:54.630> that<00:01:54.930> but<00:01:57.200> there<00:01:58.200> see<00:01:58.670> that's

00:01:59.660 --> 00:01:59.670 
the inside of that but there see that's

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:01.580 
the inside of that but there see that's
what<00:01:59.909> you<00:02:00.030> want<00:02:00.210> you<00:02:00.360> want<00:02:00.479> the<00:02:00.780> pipe<00:02:01.140> to<00:02:01.320> slide

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:01.590 
what you want you want the pipe to slide

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:11.280 
what you want you want the pipe to slide
nicely<00:02:01.920> over<00:02:02.460> top<00:02:02.670> like<00:02:02.700> that

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:11.290 

00:02:11.290 --> 00:02:39.400 

you

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:39.410 

00:02:39.410 --> 00:02:43.910 

now<00:02:40.410> Here<00:02:40.710> I<00:02:40.740> am<00:02:42.140> checking<00:02:43.140> to<00:02:43.380> see<00:02:43.590> what

00:02:43.910 --> 00:02:43.920 
now Here I am checking to see what

00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:46.900 
now Here I am checking to see what
length<00:02:44.580> of<00:02:44.850> pipe<00:02:45.090> I<00:02:45.330> need<00:02:45.510> for<00:02:45.810> my<00:02:46.110> surrounding

00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:46.910 
length of pipe I need for my surrounding

00:02:46.910 --> 00:02:50.390 
length of pipe I need for my surrounding
shroud<00:02:48.020> you<00:02:49.020> want<00:02:49.230> to<00:02:49.320> make<00:02:49.440> this<00:02:49.560> as<00:02:49.770> long<00:02:50.040> as

00:02:50.390 --> 00:02:50.400 
shroud you want to make this as long as

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:51.170

I<00:02:51.709> was<00:02:52.709> suggest<00:02:53.100> somewhere<00:02:53.490> in<00:02:53.580> the<00:02:53.730> area<00:02:53.850> of

00:02:54.050 --> 00:02:54.060 
I was suggest somewhere in the area of

00:02:54.060 --> 00:02:55.850 
I was suggest somewhere in the area of
four<00:02:54.390> and<00:02:54.540> a<00:02:54.570> half<00:02:54.600> to<00:02:55.140> five<00:02:55.380> feet<00:02:55.620> long

depending on your local code from your
p-trap<00:02:59.760> to<00:03:00.180> your<00:03:00.330> vent<00:03:00.600> that<00:03:01.050> is<00:03:01.200> the<00:03:01.380> length

00:03:01.520 --> 00:03:01.530 
p-trap to your vent that is the length

00:03:01.530 --> 00:03:12.010 
p-trap to your vent that is the length
of<00:03:01.800> your<00:03:01.920> exchanger

00:03:12.010 --> 00:03:12.020 

00:03:12.020 --> 00:03:16.570 

first<00:03:12.470> you<00:03:12.820> slide<00:03:13.820> your<00:03:14.830> two<00:03:15.830> inch<00:03:16.040> over<00:03:16.550> the

00:03:16.570 --> 00:03:16.580 
first you slide your two inch over the

00:03:16.580 --> 00:03:24.640 
first you slide your two inch over the
years<00:03:16.820> and<00:03:16.970> a<00:03:17.030> half<00:03:18.340> now<00:03:22.510> just<00:03:23.510> like<00:03:23.750> your<00:03:24.020> knee

00:03:24.640 --> 00:03:24.650 
years and a half now just like your knee

00:03:24.650 --> 00:03:29.590 
years and a half now just like your knee
over<00:03:24.920> top<00:03:27.640> now<00:03:28.640> this<00:03:28.850> is<00:03:29.000> basically<00:03:29.360> what

00:03:29.590 --> 00:03:29.600 
over top now this is basically what

00:03:29.600 --> 00:03:31.180 
over top now this is basically what
we're<00:03:29.720> doing<00:03:29.750> then<00:03:30.080> this<00:03:30.440> two<00:03:30.710> inch<00:03:30.890> is<00:03:30.980> going

00:03:31.180 --> 00:03:31.190 
we're doing then this two inch is going

00:03:31.190 --> 00:03:33.750 
we're doing then this two inch is going
to<00:03:31.310> be<00:03:31.430> the<00:03:31.580> outer<00:03:31.820> casing<00:03:32.360> of<00:03:32.780> the<00:03:32.810> chamber

00:03:33.750 --> 00:03:33.760 
to be the outer casing of the chamber

00:03:33.760 --> 00:03:37.750 
to be the outer casing of the chamber
this<00:03:34.760> is<00:03:35.120> your<00:03:35.990> surface<00:03:36.440> area<00:03:36.620> this<00:03:36.920> pipe<00:03:37.580> is

00:03:37.750 --> 00:03:37.760 
this is your surface area this pipe is

00:03:37.760 --> 00:03:46.210 
this is your surface area this pipe is
