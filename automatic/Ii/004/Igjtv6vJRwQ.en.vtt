00:00:00.900 --> 00:00:03.389
 b that becomes a today a rightful one 

00:00:03.030 --> 00:00:05.879
 rash 

00:00:03.389 --> 00:00:06.540
 yes I think you assume that 

00:00:05.879 --> 00:00:08.700
 with that 

00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:10.200
 very disappointed yes because i think 

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:12.120
 that you have to be home from ns so win 

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:13.380
 that is why we are indeed disappointed 

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:15.389
 if you have seen the match then find 

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:16.350
 I being a modern them here 

00:00:15.389 --> 00:00:18.390
 rightly makes a point 

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:21.960
 think in-house with the supporters 

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:23.910
 find out you are doing good top 10 when 

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:26.189
 the competition and a second half bottle 

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:27.449
 they come back 

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:29.310
 yes only we are actually the only one 

00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:30.539
 weather go play football and we create 

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:33.840
 chance 

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:35.520
 identical now per best game but what a 

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:37.739
 quality work sorry he is to to win 

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:40.559
 and operated by something if so those seconds 

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:42.329
 he says we start well that's right 

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:44.190
 their first half are the dominant ones 

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:45.930
 opportunities created 

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:49.110
 we thought yes well this is what i am 

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:50.879
 but some had expected first half 

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:53.309
 we can not put them under pressure quickly 

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:54.809
 lower in the only opportunities they 

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:56.460
 were created by our own mistake and 

00:00:54.809 --> 00:00:58.859
 with changes in game resumes but so 

00:00:56.460 --> 00:01:02.370
 a lot of dangerous their second half 

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:04.199
 what optimistic I think and they grab 

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:06.990
 many the second ball and therefore came 

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:08.130
 no more just playing football with more 

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:10.710
 martial soccer 

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:12.840
 as your first half for a moment as the first 

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:14.130
 in a furrow then I find vitesse de 

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:17.220
 better team rightly the one how 

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:19.799
 you thought it was a head start 

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:21.299
 you and I liked it that it 

00:01:19.799 --> 00:01:22.530
 that is coming but i also thought we were the 

00:01:21.299 --> 00:01:26.070
 first half not our normal level 

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:27.630
 port and mine that we know that normal 

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:29.549
 level then I would also earlier 

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:31.079
 make that second and it happened 

00:01:29.549 --> 00:01:32.729
 nothing and then you know a match 

00:01:31.079 --> 00:01:35.100
 that guys at some point anyway 

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:36.570
 what become anxious and yes it stands out 

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:39.390
 start with the one that depends then what 

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:41.280
 in the air and that is a pity 

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:43.229
 frame becomes the one saw afterwards 

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:48.299
 we got some grip on what happened 

00:01:43.229 --> 00:01:50.159
 then making you control no me again 

00:01:48.299 --> 00:01:53.759
 we just think it will be for the 

00:01:50.159 --> 00:01:56.040
 two went and had a lot of possession 

00:01:53.759 --> 00:01:57.899
 long-term and got create we will 

00:01:56.040 --> 00:02:00.329
 certainly in the last 5 minutes many opportunities 

00:01:57.899 --> 00:02:02.610
 Well your keeper picked up fantastic fantastic pains 

00:02:00.329 --> 00:02:03.719
 building in the old remains the one I found 

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:05.610
 that he did not do well 

00:02:03.719 --> 00:02:06.960
 today first not at all but it 

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:09.750
 second team not at all 

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:10.920
 And yes then to the one one then each other there 

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:12.420
 There are still some great opportunities out there 

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:14.910
 at also had so what that it 

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:19.230
 theater tie I can live with 

00:02:14.910 --> 00:02:22.200
 short your first legal yes you have that 

00:02:19.230 --> 00:02:24.510
 myth bonus for wood block what a 

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:28.160
 restorer and at score and the teams u 

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:28.160
