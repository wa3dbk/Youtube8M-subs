00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:04.370
 This week, there are holidays for healthy salmon attacks, our vital drinking water 

00:00:04.370 --> 00:00:08.250
 and the most embarrassing situations on earth, and first of all a wonderful good day 

00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:11.360
 dear people, the hacki here, welcome to the 51. 

00:00:11.360 --> 00:00:15.330
 Follow nonsense calendar! 

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:22.790
 After a weekend full of steaks and blowjobs and the "all-you-think-it-is-wrong-day" 

00:00:22.790 --> 00:00:25.090
 we start this week appropriately on 16. 

00:00:25.090 --> 00:00:27.800
 March with the "all-you-do-it-is-right-day". 

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:30.660
 Do not worry, something is going wrong today, that's all, you can not 

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:31.660
 to be wrong. 

00:00:31.660 --> 00:00:34.710
 Although I want to limit that so far that it is not a free ticket, your teacher 

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:38.350
 to show the middle finger and tell him that he is a deviated whore son. 

00:00:38.350 --> 00:00:40.750
 No, that would not be right at all. 

00:00:40.750 --> 00:00:41.750
 It continues on 17. 

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:42.750
 March with the "St. 

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:44.740
 Patrick's Day, Ireland's national holiday. 

00:00:44.740 --> 00:00:48.589
 This folk festival actually celebrates the first Christian missionary of Ireland, Bishop Patrick 

00:00:48.589 --> 00:00:50.739
 and it is therefore originally a church feast. 

00:00:50.739 --> 00:00:53.260
 But under the motto "Everybody's Irish on St. 

00:00:53.260 --> 00:00:56.579
 Patrick's Day "is attracted to green around the world in solidarity with Ireland 

00:00:56.579 --> 00:01:00.210
 and - of course, also in connection with Ireland - the head drunk away. 

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:04.360
 And so there are parades and parties in many cities around the world, the Irish national hero 

00:01:04.360 --> 00:01:05.360
 St. 

00:01:05.360 --> 00:01:06.360
 Patrick to celebrate. 

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:07.360
 Who the next morning on 18. 

00:01:07.360 --> 00:01:10.710
 March completely hangover next to an unknown person wakes up, can directly "Awkward 

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:13.160
 Moments Day ", freely translated" Embarrassing moments day "celebration. 

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:16.300
 Life is full of moments where one wishes oneself to open the ground and one 

00:01:16.300 --> 00:01:17.300
 sinking into it. 

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:20.320
 For example, if you introduce a new colleague to the company employees and you 

00:01:20.320 --> 00:01:23.420
 Does not know names of people with whom one chats daily for years. 

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:26.281
 Or this typical situation in the city, when one runs to a person, and 

00:01:26.281 --> 00:01:29.470
 you always dodge at the same time to the left and right, only to then against each other 

00:01:29.470 --> 00:01:30.470
 to run. 

00:01:30.470 --> 00:01:33.460
 What happened to you when you wanted to break yourself in the air with embarrassment 

00:01:33.460 --> 00:01:34.460
 would have? 

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:36.730
 Write me your most unpleasant story in The Comments. 

00:01:36.730 --> 00:01:39.570
 Most of the time, after a short while you can already smile about such things, and fittingly 

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:40.570
 this is on 19. 

00:01:40.570 --> 00:01:42.320
 March the "Lass-us-laugh-day". 

00:01:42.320 --> 00:01:45.220
 It's no secret, laughter is healthy, and on this day you can be with one 

00:01:45.220 --> 00:01:47.420
 Extra portion of laughter for your well-being. 

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:50.960
 And to make my contribution to having something to laugh about: here is a selfie 

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:52.390
 from a stoned monkey. 

00:01:52.390 --> 00:01:53.390
 It continues on the 20th. 

00:01:53.390 --> 00:01:55.180
 March with the international "Day of Happiness". 

00:01:55.180 --> 00:01:58.590
 Happiness is so important to man that this day of action is from the United Nations 

00:01:58.590 --> 00:01:59.620
 was decided. 

00:01:59.620 --> 00:02:02.170
 However, this is about happiness in the sense of well-being, not about that 

00:02:02.170 --> 00:02:05.950
 Random luck playing the lottery, with a lottery win in turn also for well-being 

00:02:05.950 --> 00:02:06.950
 contributes. 

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:10.700
 Hmmm ... Well, no matter: in each of us is a little lucky guy, so seek 

00:02:10.700 --> 00:02:12.250
 your goals to be happy! 

00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:13.250
 On the 21st 

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:16.730
 March is so damn busy in terms of holidays, so it was really hard for me to decide 

00:02:16.730 --> 00:02:17.920
 which is probably the most important here. 

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:21.030
 But after a short consideration, it should be clear to everyone that the "Corn Dog Day" 

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:22.760
 most absolutely significant. 

00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:23.760
 I mean hello? 

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:27.599
 This is a sausage in an outside crispy and inside soft pastry on a stem. 

00:02:27.599 --> 00:02:31.700
 I really do not know what to focus on that dayeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee 

00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:36.159
 Let's come to another important topic because on 22. 

00:02:36.159 --> 00:02:37.709
 March is the "World Water Day". 

00:02:37.709 --> 00:02:41.349
 This day introduced by the UN should point out that nearly 1 billion people 

00:02:41.349 --> 00:02:43.799
 in the world has no access to clean drinking water. 

00:02:43.799 --> 00:02:46.340
 This fact must be melted on the tongue. 

00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:49.349
 The most normal thing in the world for us, that we only have to make a gesture around 

00:02:49.349 --> 00:02:52.139
 Unfortunately, getting fluent water is not that common everywhere. 

00:02:52.139 --> 00:02:55.810
 There are many events and actions on this day to work on this grievance 

00:02:55.810 --> 00:02:59.459
 and the least we can do is to save some water ourselves, not so 

00:02:59.459 --> 00:03:02.430
 15 minutes under the shower and the toilet flushing whenever possible 

00:03:02.430 --> 00:03:03.620
 Press the economy button. 

00:03:03.620 --> 00:03:06.540
 Tell that to as many people as possible, and to get rid of them right away, that's the episode 

00:03:06.540 --> 00:03:07.540
 over here too! 

00:03:07.540 --> 00:03:10.529
 If you liked it, leave me a nice review and a comment. 

00:03:10.529 --> 00:03:13.690
 Right you come to the last episode Quatschkalender and left for all who's missed so far 

00:03:13.690 --> 00:03:15.939
 have an info video about the hackishirts. 

00:03:15.939 --> 00:03:19.430
 Follow me on Twitter, Instagram and Facebook to miss anything and joa, then 

00:03:19.430 --> 00:03:23.269
 I would say we'll meet again next week, at the last regular episode of 

00:03:23.269 --> 00:03:24.269
 Calendar nonsense! 

00:03:24.269 --> 00:03:25.540
 Hauter in, your hacki!
