00:00:03.200 --> 00:00:09.240
 Marie introduced the p 8 leit today 

00:00:07.109 --> 00:00:11.519
 Here again in comparison to the p8 as the 

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:12.780
 name is easy to guess it is 

00:00:11.519 --> 00:00:15.179
 of course a little stripped down 

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:17.490
 version being small now not really 

00:00:15.179 --> 00:00:21.119
 in terms of size they are 

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:24.420
 really almost identical good with 77 

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:28.170
 instead of 64 millimeters slightly thicker and 

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:29.490
 above all things 131 city ​​144 grams 

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:30.750
 So a little easier 

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:33.030
 You already notice that a bit 

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:34.710
 that has good reason because we have 

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:38.129
 Do not hold this aluminum unibody here 

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:40.770
 as with the g8 but package marks relatively 

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:43.829
 regular size with the metal frame 

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:45.360
 around the back it could be 

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:46.230
 not explain it here now but me 

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:48.180
 I'm pretty sure it 

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:50.280
 probably plastic is and 

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:52.920
 only metallic look because 

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:54.510
 where else should this serious 

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:55.350
 difference in weight now here 

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:57.239
 come from somewhere 

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:59.039
 So we start from plastic 

00:00:57.239 --> 00:01:00.719
 Of course it is a bit too 

00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:02.670
 slimmed down completely clear you can see that 

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:05.280
 already here, for example, no back 

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:08.390
 two colored LEDs but only one white 

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:10.380
 LED also no optical 

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:12.689
 Bildstabilisator I am already 

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:14.880
 closer to this here at the p8 

00:01:12.689 --> 00:01:17.159
 this falls away, but identical 

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:19.939
 resolution so 3 10 megapixel photos 

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:23.070
 videos in full hd and the front camera 

00:01:19.939 --> 00:01:25.710
 videos also in full hd and photos 

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:27.840
 with five megapixels that's still the 

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:29.759
 small difference the 8 megapixel 

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:31.860
 but that's what I think now 

00:01:29.759 --> 00:01:33.990
 even the prices live completely 

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:34.650
 other is because I'm at the end again 

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:37.229
 it a 

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:40.920
 it is also a slightly smaller display 

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:42.899
 now 5 inches instead of 5.2 inches with it 

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:46.079
 We are here again, so to speak 

00:01:42.899 --> 00:01:48.390
 times that p7 to that also has 5 inches 

00:01:46.079 --> 00:01:50.159
 You see, that's the same smaller now 

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:53.909
 difference here with the flaggschiffs 

00:01:50.159 --> 00:01:57.990
 So p7 p8 full hd here in the middle 

00:01:53.909 --> 00:01:59.610
 midrange device 720 x 1280 pixels 

00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:01.200
 that is there but already a small 

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:04.440
 Did I make a difference here? 

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:05.610
 settings in or the 

00:02:04.440 --> 00:02:07.200
 Write here a bit 

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:09.060
 we can do different things here 

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:10.680
 so scroll through the menu pages 

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:12.390
 that looks like you are not involved now 

00:02:10.680 --> 00:02:13.920
 bare eyes so gigantic 

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:15.930
 difference as we sometimes from the 

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:18.030
 pay close to the pixie density 

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:19.860
 I think so you can already do that 

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:20.910
 really live as I said come price 

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:23.700
 we speak the same again on 

00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:25.080
 yes p7 body lying away what is 

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:27.060
 otherwise the difference in the 

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:30.630
 Comparison to the big flagship model 

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:33.270
 It's also an ips display, too 

00:02:30.630 --> 00:02:34.290
 a bit darker I succeeded 

00:02:33.270 --> 00:02:36.090
 could someone in the example 

00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:39.240
 call the browser then you can see it 

00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:41.540
 even with a naked eye 357 candela per 

00:02:39.240 --> 00:02:44.190
 square meter I measured here 468 

00:02:41.540 --> 00:02:45.750
 So a difference you also 

00:02:44.190 --> 00:02:47.820
 with a naked eye but now also 

00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:49.560
 not so dramatic 

00:02:47.820 --> 00:02:52.710
 Of course, there is another 

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:56.400
 processor in it is now the kirn 620 

00:02:52.710 --> 00:02:59.250
 here as I know 930 know who has here 

00:02:56.400 --> 00:03:02.190
 although eight cores also 64 bit 

00:02:59.250 --> 00:03:04.440
 support, however, all 18 with 1.2 

00:03:02.190 --> 00:03:10.320
 gigahertz clocked remember you here 

00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:12.000
 four times 204 x 154 8 x 1.2 gigahertz so 

00:03:10.320 --> 00:03:13.709
 that's another price class 

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:16.170
 especially since I also have two gigabytes 

00:03:13.709 --> 00:03:18.390
 Memory instead of three I have 

00:03:16.170 --> 00:03:20.370
 very firmly believe that in the 

00:03:18.390 --> 00:03:22.020
 benchmark already clearer 

00:03:20.370 --> 00:03:24.690
 difference will be felt so 

00:03:22.020 --> 00:03:27.930
 gamers are therefore certainly the p8 

00:03:24.690 --> 00:03:29.940
 not only do otto normal users tend 

00:03:27.930 --> 00:03:31.950
 phoning sms a bit and surfing 

00:03:29.940 --> 00:03:35.040
 so on will probably with 

00:03:31.950 --> 00:03:37.950
 the p8 night certainly come to trade 

00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:40.380
 Another difference is here in the 

00:03:37.950 --> 00:03:43.110
 edge to notice in these two 

00:03:40.380 --> 00:03:45.959
 Slots are identical in principle 

00:03:43.110 --> 00:03:47.550
 But in some countries, so too 

00:03:45.959 --> 00:03:49.980
 in germany two different models 

00:03:47.550 --> 00:03:52.350
 down here is the sim card again 

00:03:49.980 --> 00:03:54.180
 in this case a micro sim and up here 

00:03:52.350 --> 00:03:56.040
 I then have the models in the 

00:03:54.180 --> 00:03:56.720
 free trade provided 

00:03:56.040 --> 00:03:59.489
 become 

00:03:56.720 --> 00:04:01.530
 the choice if I either the sd 

00:03:59.489 --> 00:04:04.200
 card purely pack here, however 

00:04:01.530 --> 00:04:06.840
 officially remembered only with up to 32 gb 

00:04:04.200 --> 00:04:10.440
 you guys at the big time then officially 128 

00:04:06.840 --> 00:04:12.960
 or I can also choose a small one 

00:04:10.440 --> 00:04:14.910
 nanos lying in the lower transverse rhine 

00:04:12.960 --> 00:04:17.880
 that means in that case I would have 

00:04:14.910 --> 00:04:18.900
 sim will do that as I said then 

00:04:17.880 --> 00:04:20.489
 probably not with the providers 

00:04:18.900 --> 00:04:23.040
 the case will be that we know yes 

00:04:20.489 --> 00:04:24.780
 already this problem was told me 

00:04:23.040 --> 00:04:26.040
 with all probably with 

00:04:24.780 --> 00:04:28.680
 becomes the greatest probability 

00:04:26.040 --> 00:04:30.330
 also this duel in the model in 

00:04:28.680 --> 00:04:31.860
 Germany available in free trade 

00:04:30.330 --> 00:04:33.260
 that's a good one 

00:04:31.860 --> 00:04:36.960
 message 

00:04:33.260 --> 00:04:39.380
 otherwise lte and so on as the g8 

00:04:36.960 --> 00:04:43.070
 that means with all advantages and disadvantages 

00:04:39.380 --> 00:04:46.080
 150 megabits per second download hspa 

00:04:43.070 --> 00:04:48.720
 nfc but not 5 gigahertz band 

00:04:46.080 --> 00:04:51.030
 support with wireless lan so too 

00:04:48.720 --> 00:04:53.130
 no wireless lan ac that one has like 

00:04:51.030 --> 00:04:55.050
 you said already cleared surface 

00:04:53.130 --> 00:04:57.570
 chased principle is identical both 

00:04:55.050 --> 00:04:59.160
 android five both is emotion july 

00:04:57.570 --> 00:05:01.110
 even if the icons of course 

00:04:59.160 --> 00:05:03.170
 look a little different around here too 

00:05:01.110 --> 00:05:05.220
 again so luxury model 

00:05:03.170 --> 00:05:07.560
 to demonstrate, however, mid-size model 

00:05:05.220 --> 00:05:10.770
 the service is of course to that effect 

00:05:07.560 --> 00:05:12.510
 identical also the p8 night should in may 

00:05:10.770 --> 00:05:15.000
 so be available too 

00:05:12.510 --> 00:05:16.620
 come along with the p8 like that and now 

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:20.280
 the price is unfriendly 

00:05:16.620 --> 00:05:23.640
 Price without contract 249 euro 

00:05:20.280 --> 00:05:24.900
 someone very dramatic 

00:05:23.640 --> 00:05:26.190
 you have to be different 

00:05:24.900 --> 00:05:27.780
 there will probably already the 

00:05:26.190 --> 00:05:29.430
 I need one or two superior ones 

00:05:27.780 --> 00:05:31.740
 Now this super luxury is really great 

00:05:29.430 --> 00:05:32.960
 i need a duper processor over here 

00:05:31.740 --> 00:05:35.700
 really this optical 

00:05:32.960 --> 00:05:38.250
 image stabilizer and I need 

00:05:35.700 --> 00:05:40.290
 really in display with full hd or 

00:05:38.250 --> 00:05:43.640
 maybe synonymous 720p 

00:05:40.290 --> 00:05:46.080
 now you have the agony of choice what 

00:05:43.640 --> 00:05:48.240
 Battery affects it in both cases 

00:05:46.080 --> 00:05:49.680
 firmly installed here 2200 

00:05:48.240 --> 00:05:52.890
 milliahole mah lithium polymer 

00:05:49.680 --> 00:05:53.490
 over here also lithium polymer 26 

00:05:52.890 --> 00:05:54.840
 80 

00:05:53.490 --> 00:05:56.580
 that means I already have one 

00:05:54.840 --> 00:05:58.290
 difference but I have that too 

00:05:56.580 --> 00:06:00.570
 smaller display that is from the 

00:05:58.290 --> 00:06:01.770
 term now without a gun must 

00:06:00.570 --> 00:06:04.080
 Of course, everything is always in the first place 

00:06:01.770 --> 00:06:06.090
 final state test completely clear though 

00:06:04.080 --> 00:06:08.130
 one would guess that one would thumb 

00:06:06.090 --> 00:06:08.610
 say half is equal with both 

00:06:08.130 --> 00:06:10.260
 his 

00:06:08.610 --> 00:06:12.630
 yes, you should already have that 

00:06:10.260 --> 00:06:14.820
 have been the first impression of the p 8 

00:06:12.630 --> 00:06:18.560
 leit many thanks in comparison to the p8 

00:06:14.820 --> 00:06:18.560
 It will be good to see you soon
