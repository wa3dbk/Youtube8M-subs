the<00:00:35.340> Fed<00:00:35.550> did<00:00:35.730> not<00:00:35.940> announce<00:00:36.329> at<00:00:37.170> least<00:00:37.440> a

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:37.620 
the Fed did not announce at least a

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:39.830 
the Fed did not announce at least a
degree<00:00:38.100> of<00:00:38.129> tapering<00:00:39.090> of<00:00:39.239> its<00:00:39.329> monetary

degree of tapering of its monetary

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:43.100 
degree of tapering of its monetary
policy<00:00:40.530> I<00:00:41.129> think<00:00:41.700> the<00:00:41.820> surprise<00:00:41.969> to<00:00:42.600> the<00:00:42.780> Fed

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:43.110 
policy I think the surprise to the Fed

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:47.750 
policy I think the surprise to the Fed
is<00:00:43.500> the<00:00:44.340> fact<00:00:44.640> that<00:00:45.200> the<00:00:46.200> US<00:00:46.559> economy<00:00:46.590> just<00:00:47.579> has

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:47.760 
is the fact that the US economy just has

not<00:00:47.969> shown<00:00:48.420> the<00:00:48.450> sustained<00:00:49.260> growth<00:00:50.100> that<00:00:50.489> it

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:50.670 
not shown the sustained growth that it

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:53.270 
not shown the sustained growth that it
