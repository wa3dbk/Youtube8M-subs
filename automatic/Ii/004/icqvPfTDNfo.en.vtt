coloured tip okay let's talk about the

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:02.799 
coloured tip okay let's talk about the
symptoms<00:01:00.539> well<00:01:01.289> the<00:01:01.410> major<00:01:01.620> symptom<00:01:02.219> is<00:01:02.370> the

00:01:02.799 --> 00:01:02.809 
symptoms well the major symptom is the

00:01:02.809 --> 00:01:05.420 
symptoms well the major symptom is the
door<00:01:03.809> lock<00:01:03.989> light<00:01:04.260> does<00:01:04.470> not<00:01:04.500> come<00:01:04.680> on<00:01:04.890> when<00:01:05.250> it

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:05.430 
door lock light does not come on when it

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:07.160 
door lock light does not come on when it
should<00:01:05.640> be<00:01:05.670> in<00:01:05.909> the<00:01:06.000> high<00:01:06.150> speed<00:01:06.210> spin<00:01:06.659> cycle

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:07.170 
should be in the high speed spin cycle

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:09.380 
should be in the high speed spin cycle
and<00:01:07.350> because<00:01:07.740> of<00:01:07.770> that<00:01:08.030> the<00:01:09.030> clothes<00:01:09.360> are

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:09.390 
and because of that the clothes are

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:13.810 
and because of that the clothes are
soaking<00:01:09.869> wet<00:01:10.049> when<00:01:10.530> the<00:01:10.650> cycle<00:01:11.070> is<00:01:11.189> finished
