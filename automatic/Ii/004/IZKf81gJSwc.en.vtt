00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.480
 hello dear viewers and welcome to this 

00:00:01.890 --> 00:00:05.730
 new spot this is a squad 

00:00:03.480 --> 00:00:07.170
 images of around 500 k so something 

00:00:05.730 --> 00:00:08.460
 more expensive than normal so we will have to 

00:00:07.170 --> 00:00:10.260
 the start and at the google 

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:12.330
 salvatori series q 

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:14.130
 city you are known berry good keeper 

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:15.660
 And you have often shown that one 

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:16.500
 few good reasons that made such 

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:18.330
 you can see here 

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:20.369
 even though it was the head forces of 

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:22.109
 Charlie is a little absent but I did 

00:00:20.369 --> 00:00:24.240
 a few very easy balls against late 

00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:26.400
 and the god's only sin first 

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:27.810
 key neighborhood is david luiz everyone knows 

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:29.760
 that louis is then i don't really have 

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:31.590
 say a clip of him 

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:33.180
 To one I already say I would PSG 

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:34.739
 version doesn't like it , play it like 

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:36.210
 the chelsea version but that will be one 

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:37.770
 something mental are probably smiling 

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:39.450
 not for me but I found this day 

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:41.010
 Smith didn't play so well in this team 

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:42.180
 we move on to the second stand 

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:43.230
 thereby canary chiny 

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:45.239
 I first had a team of the season 

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:47.579
 version of chiny I don't want that very much 

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:49.110
 very fantastic this guest is a lot 

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:49.500
 better it a problem that i am with him 

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:50.670
 had 

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:52.170
 is actually that it can have bad 

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:53.760
 I think I had shown that with the 

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:55.620
 clip of syria but for the rest i am 

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:58.170
 is talking about the defensive 

00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:59.070
 qualities of celi or kiellinie i will 

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:00.660
 do not know how to pronounce 

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:02.219
 but someone will do it in the comments 

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:03.480
 say the may also be the last 

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:05.309
 thereby me who am nazi yes 

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:07.200
 probably my favorite channel 

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:08.580
 I really liked it and also city 

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:10.049
 exactly how far they've had but I think 

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:12.659
 its regular version finer 

00:01:10.049 --> 00:01:15.360
 he could really buy fantastic 566 co2 

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:17.009
 Adwords of that I really need and fine with 

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:18.509
 far the best close to Kuyt I think 

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:20.220
 I thought he was fantastic he 

00:01:18.509 --> 00:01:21.960
 basically everyone and I go for him 

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:24.119
 now on to the left more to the first 

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:25.500
 in shape I have bought on the left for and 

00:01:24.119 --> 00:01:26.939
 it's just cuadrado 

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:28.860
 the more in shape shot so I have 

00:01:26.939 --> 00:01:30.630
 I think his second forum is deniz van 

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:32.100
 the second in full on the left for but 

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:33.329
 I thought it was pretty nice 

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:34.890
 this problem i had with him was that 

00:01:33.329 --> 00:01:35.909
 he doesn't play as 5 volts as crazy 

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:38.280
 blacksmith position 

00:01:35.909 --> 00:01:39.930
 he was just a little clumsy alone 

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:41.430
 this kind of finished off until that cub evening 

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:42.329
 promotions that are fun in itself 

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:43.560
 see it once 

00:01:42.329 --> 00:01:45.030
 but excellent not really very much 

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:46.530
 bags so I'm not going to buy it 

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:48.479
 because I didn't like it on a species 

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:50.250
 personally find the regular version of 

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:51.540
 its the nicest in the middle of crazy 

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:53.130
 on an initiative to see pleated 

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:55.259
 I must use that but we go 

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:56.610
 to the second in forum or from the 

00:01:55.259 --> 00:01:58.500
 First team to see I have to say and 

00:01:56.610 --> 00:02:00.180
 that is danielle daryl see you the 

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:00.899
 Rossi has extreme how the defensive 

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:02.189
 stats 

00:02:00.899 --> 00:02:04.079
 timmy problem because i had had it 

00:02:02.189 --> 00:02:05.850
 that I was the position very often and 

00:02:04.079 --> 00:02:07.740
 tallow occurred are good qualities 

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:09.119
 that time well off the bus but for the 

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:11.099
 rest he is very good has one 

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:12.120
 fantastic god though he has undergone 

00:02:11.099 --> 00:02:13.470
 spotted me 

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:15.240
 well bake heard the posts 

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:16.770
 yes he has little real for the rest 

00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:18.300
 well done 

00:02:16.770 --> 00:02:19.650
 I have or that your moths would 

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:20.940
 maybe I should be at the weakest 

00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:21.840
 switch but I actually thought it was fine 

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:23.340
 nice 

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:25.080
 One problem is if you have no powers 

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:26.700
 gets a he toy from that at every 

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:28.950
 how lost but I shoot well oh 

00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:29.970
 defending the guy well and he's alone 

00:02:28.950 --> 00:02:31.110
 something very fast 

00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:32.790
 for the rest i think best 

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:34.980
 would be fine back on more defensive with 

00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:36.270
 but for that price he is certainly good and 

00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:37.710
 definitely worth the money 

00:02:36.270 --> 00:02:39.660
 about a crazy middle and and we lucas 

00:02:37.710 --> 00:02:41.040
 you can stand the info folder but I think 

00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:42.750
 its regular version is fine 

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:44.160
 its 100k more expensive in forest so i can 

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:46.020
 yes then I know the regular version 

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:48.270
 great the snow for the player he is 

00:02:46.020 --> 00:02:50.190
 very far as if saying so agile 

00:02:48.270 --> 00:02:51.600
 own good shooting and I feel tired or 

00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:53.280
 generally really new to the middle right 

00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:54.810
 he was already a very professional position and is 

00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:56.400
 blanket for nothing very much I 

00:02:54.810 --> 00:02:58.830
 we are talking about the the team gram 

00:02:56.400 --> 00:03:00.450
 escort rikus really the goal boys like me 

00:02:58.830 --> 00:03:02.400
 a pk and um to he is me anyway 

00:03:00.450 --> 00:03:04.680
 simply dribbling is fantastic 

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:06.330
 Magnificent will do see this clip too 

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:07.800
 he then shuffled with every defend and 

00:03:06.330 --> 00:03:09.930
 paul it can still be put to 

00:03:07.800 --> 00:03:11.490
 his shot is really fantastic too 

00:03:09.930 --> 00:03:13.260
 shoot almost everything and everything when you get up 

00:03:11.490 --> 00:03:15.209
 his left foot comes and he is with 

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:16.980
 further best period 10 I think it's real 

00:03:15.209 --> 00:03:18.630
 fantastic and I recommend everyone to 

00:03:16.980 --> 00:03:20.910
 You do n't have to buy it 

00:03:18.630 --> 00:03:23.100
 to pick up this player on this version 

00:03:20.910 --> 00:03:24.780
 Driemond k is a cheaper and I think 

00:03:23.100 --> 00:03:26.730
 it sure the money where just has 6 

00:03:24.780 --> 00:03:27.720
 goals god and sevens is given 

00:03:26.730 --> 00:03:29.970
 transfer I think he is really one 

00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:30.930
 fantastic player so definitely costs ziggo 

00:03:29.970 --> 00:03:32.910
 have money 

00:03:30.930 --> 00:03:34.380
 the first pointed this team I already first 

00:03:32.910 --> 00:03:35.940
 I also got the team scene version 

00:03:34.380 --> 00:03:37.350
 actually replace it with inhabit 

00:03:35.940 --> 00:03:38.730
 this is also the martinus hatching 

00:03:37.350 --> 00:03:40.709
 colombia which I just leave 

00:03:38.730 --> 00:03:42.090
 put that is good for me you were 

00:03:40.709 --> 00:03:43.680
 an i say this is really a lot 

00:03:42.090 --> 00:03:45.930
 played less but it will be better 

00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:47.400
 to be something mental but I thought 

00:03:45.930 --> 00:03:48.959
 not play him as well as often 

00:03:47.400 --> 00:03:51.030
 position but if you came one on one 

00:03:48.959 --> 00:03:53.100
 types very simply everything he is 

00:03:51.030 --> 00:03:54.209
 fast he can finish well and buy them 

00:03:53.100 --> 00:03:56.100
 say fantastic 

00:03:54.209 --> 00:03:57.959
 he jumps 500 meters in the air like the 

00:03:56.100 --> 00:03:59.730
 gets a chance and jumps almost every one 

00:03:57.959 --> 00:04:00.930
 defend by actually already out and me 

00:03:59.730 --> 00:04:02.430
 think it is really very good 4 

00:04:00.930 --> 00:04:04.170
 star week foot and 4 star skill 

00:04:02.430 --> 00:04:05.280
 Boosting made love your brother great 

00:04:04.170 --> 00:04:07.110
 mobile is a lot better 

00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:08.280
 but then we move on to the all 

00:04:07.110 --> 00:04:09.540
 let play from the team 

00:04:08.280 --> 00:04:11.700
 I can probably guess it is 

00:04:09.540 --> 00:04:12.930
 of course all pitfall or pitfall 

00:04:11.700 --> 00:04:13.230
 is just what you want to emphasize 

00:04:12.930 --> 00:04:15.570
 to lay 

00:04:13.230 --> 00:04:17.340
 he is 9 in general and I am ridiculed as 9 

00:04:15.570 --> 00:04:19.200
 generally he is also 1 of the neighborhood 

00:04:17.340 --> 00:04:20.760
 the team played 15 goals and 10 

00:04:19.200 --> 00:04:22.680
 assist and he just stands on a good one 

00:04:20.760 --> 00:04:24.510
 place but it also a good force and 

00:04:22.680 --> 00:04:25.210
 Despite its length, of course one can 

00:04:24.510 --> 00:04:27.669
 Have 90 

00:04:25.210 --> 00:04:29.199
 just beat fantastic as the opportunity 

00:04:27.669 --> 00:04:30.729
 stands still yet that very often 

00:04:29.199 --> 00:04:32.800
 defend himself and he really is how 

00:04:30.729 --> 00:04:34.360
 fantastic just buy don't be afraid 

00:04:32.800 --> 00:04:36.099
 to them he suddenly my doctor espace 

00:04:34.360 --> 00:04:37.810
 he really is the best for a while 

00:04:36.099 --> 00:04:39.370
 peak I have ever used 

00:04:37.810 --> 00:04:41.259
 and he simply by fantastic me 

00:04:39.370 --> 00:04:43.300
 funny for around as never used to 

00:04:41.259 --> 00:04:44.620
 buy once or is why I am for it 

00:04:43.300 --> 00:04:46.419
 unfortunately the Visschere skill moves 

00:04:44.620 --> 00:04:48.250
 not 5 stars more than once again 

00:04:46.419 --> 00:04:50.349
 just really the roland and this is it 

00:04:48.250 --> 00:04:51.759
 end of team or end of the review 

00:04:50.349 --> 00:04:53.349
 oh must i say that despite me 

00:04:51.759 --> 00:04:55.660
 I said a lot of positive points 

00:04:53.349 --> 00:04:56.919
 I found this not too nice 

00:04:55.660 --> 00:04:58.360
 just the regular version of the tar 

00:04:56.919 --> 00:05:00.699
 very always someone's it is a lot 

00:04:58.360 --> 00:05:01.780
 play nicer and give 7 out of 10 

00:05:00.699 --> 00:05:03.699
 because it just has some 

00:05:01.780 --> 00:05:04.930
 points for improvement but this is the end of it 

00:05:03.699 --> 00:05:06.580
 the virus coach liked him 

00:05:04.930 --> 00:05:08.380
 find it not and longer to load because 

00:05:06.580 --> 00:05:10.330
 culm huge march to you could're looking 

00:05:08.380 --> 00:05:12.729
