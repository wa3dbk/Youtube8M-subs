buzzer<00:00:14.759> this<00:00:15.450> is<00:00:15.660> a<00:00:15.690> relatively<00:00:16.170> easy<00:00:16.289> pattern

00:00:16.849 --> 00:00:16.859 
buzzer this is a relatively easy pattern

00:00:16.859 --> 00:00:19.340 
buzzer this is a relatively easy pattern
to<00:00:17.010> tie<00:00:17.279> and<00:00:17.609> I<00:00:18.240> think<00:00:18.480> you<00:00:18.570> will<00:00:18.720> find<00:00:18.900> it<00:00:19.140> as<00:00:19.260> a

00:00:19.340 --> 00:00:19.350 
to tie and I think you will find it as a

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:21.710 
to tie and I think you will find it as a
useful<00:00:19.560> addition<00:00:19.920> to<00:00:20.369> your<00:00:20.430> fly<00:00:20.640> box<00:00:21.000> so<00:00:21.689> let's

00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:21.720 
useful addition to your fly box so let's

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:24.250 
useful addition to your fly box so let's
crack<00:00:22.350> on<00:00:22.380> with<00:00:22.560> it

00:00:24.250 --> 00:00:24.260 
crack on with it

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:35.790 
mr. shipment I think back in the 70s or

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:41.389 
mr. shipment I think back in the 70s or
early<00:00:36.120> 80s<00:00:36.559> to<00:00:38.000> imitate<00:00:39.000> the<00:00:39.620> buzzer<00:00:40.620> as<00:00:41.190> it

00:00:41.389 --> 00:00:41.399 
early 80s to imitate the buzzer as it

00:00:41.399 --> 00:00:44.840 
early 80s to imitate the buzzer as it
emerged<00:00:41.760> and<00:00:42.120> was<00:00:42.780> temporarily<00:00:43.550> suspended<00:00:44.550> in

just do another pinch sales fell for the
thorax<00:02:34.920> you<00:02:35.920> can<00:02:36.100> use<00:02:36.310> a<00:02:36.900> different<00:02:37.900> color

00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:47.980 
through dye in front of it just to make

00:02:47.980 --> 00:02:56.850 
through dye in front of it just to make
the<00:02:48.510> front<00:02:49.510> part<00:02:49.840> lift<00:02:50.170> up<00:02:50.350> a<00:02:50.440> little<00:02:55.830> we<00:02:56.830> can

00:02:56.850 --> 00:02:56.860 
the front part lift up a little we can

00:02:56.860 --> 00:03:27.869 
the front part lift up a little we can
finish<00:02:57.220> it<00:02:57.459> off<00:02:58.380> with<00:02:59.380> a<00:02:59.440> couple<00:02:59.860> of

00:03:27.869 --> 00:03:27.879 

00:03:27.879 --> 00:03:30.729 

well<00:03:28.879> we<00:03:29.000> do<00:03:29.120> it<00:03:29.209> the<00:03:29.300> stages<00:03:29.750> then<00:03:29.930> cut<00:03:30.650> them

00:03:30.729 --> 00:03:30.739 
well we do it the stages then cut them
