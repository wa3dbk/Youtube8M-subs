00:02:17.114 --> 00:02:20.644
Soldier: The bell... I can hear the bell from everywhere...!

00:02:20.744 --> 00:02:29.609
Ah, calm down! Don't worry about the bell sound! Sou Moutoku-sama is past us!

00:02:29.709 --> 00:02:37.189
Everyone, stop the enemy without worrying for your lives!
We must protect Karin-sama no matter what!

00:02:37.289 --> 00:02:52.887
...That said, this place is already filled with Kan banners...
Rin-chan, we should fall back to the rear and regroup.

00:02:53.087 --> 00:02:55.922
But!

00:02:56.022 --> 00:03:13.412
Calm down. We might be of use in a battle of solider against solider, but if 
our ranks fall that much, we must avoid any harm done to the officers.

00:03:13.512 --> 00:03:23.712
We should meet up with Shunran-sama and Shuuran-sama, 
as they retreat and prepare both officers and soldiers.

00:03:23.812 --> 00:03:28.375
...You're as calm as always, Fuu.
(Fuu is their best strategist, I wonder why she's not the main one)

00:03:28.475 --> 00:03:34.498
It's because my best friend gets easily excited.
(Keifa's nowhere near good at strategy and she's the main strategist of Gi...)

00:03:34.598 --> 00:03:40.369
...Heh. Sorry for all the times. You've opened my eyes.

00:03:40.469 --> 00:03:46.474
Don't worry about that... well then, let's fall back.

00:03:46.574 --> 00:03:48.957
Yeah!

00:03:53.846 --> 00:03:56.695
Soldier: Enemy army is retreating!

00:03:56.795 --> 00:04:07.073
Good! Now's our chance! Renfa-sama, give the 
assault order to the main force... ugh! Guh!

00:04:07.173 --> 00:04:09.661
Kazuto: Meirin!?

00:04:09.761 --> 00:04:17.356
Don't come here, Hongou! Focus on victory instead of me right now!

00:04:17.456 --> 00:04:22.078
Coughing out blood, Meirin leaned against the wall to avoid falling and kept talking.

00:04:22.178 --> 00:04:28.131
Renfa-sama, quickly! Give your assault order quickly... !

00:04:28.231 --> 00:04:31.108
But...!

00:04:31.308 --> 00:04:42.625
Renfa-sama! You're the king! When you have to act, 
do what you have to for Go! Never forget that...!

00:04:42.825 --> 00:04:46.136
...Fine.
(That was fast. Renfa has grown, I guess)

00:04:46.236 --> 00:04:54.842
Meirin... watch from over there. The moment we win against Sousou...

00:04:54.942 --> 00:05:01.803
Yeah... I'll take that sight with me to the afterlife.

00:05:01.903 --> 00:05:06.020
Turning away from Meirin, who muttered in a weak voice, 
Renfa took out her sword and gave her speech to the army.

00:05:06.827 --> 00:05:13.132
Hear me! Soldiers of Go! My comrades!

00:05:13.332 --> 00:05:20.101
We're going to assault the main camp of Gi now!

00:05:20.201 --> 00:05:26.134
Let's win this war and end the warring times!

00:05:26.234 --> 00:05:29.614
Soldiers: Yeah!

00:05:29.714 --> 00:05:36.127
Defeat the conqueror Sousou under our gallant banners!
(Translating without internet with one offline program and my brains alone is hard...)

00:05:36.227 --> 00:05:41.963
Troops... assault!

00:05:46.313 --> 00:05:53.428
That's right... that's good, Renfa-sama...

00:05:53.528 --> 00:06:01.611
Grasp victory. A glory for Go...
