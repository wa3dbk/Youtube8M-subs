00:00:16.670 --> 00:00:16.680 
doing today since I came through and

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:19.370 
doing today since I came through and

raked<00:00:19.590> half<00:00:19.770> of<00:00:19.890> it<00:00:19.980> because<00:00:20.130> there's<00:00:20.460> so<00:00:20.609> much

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:20.730 
raked half of it because there's so much

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:21.950 
raked half of it because there's so much
hay<00:00:20.910> down<00:00:21.060> here<00:00:21.300> that<00:00:21.449> we<00:00:21.510> figured<00:00:21.810> we

00:00:21.950 --> 00:00:21.960 
hay down here that we figured we

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:23.150 
hay down here that we figured we
wouldn't<00:00:22.170> be<00:00:22.289> able<00:00:22.350> to<00:00:22.500> get<00:00:22.619> all<00:00:22.710> that<00:00:22.740> done<00:00:23.010> in

one<00:00:23.310> day<00:00:23.460> so<00:00:23.699> we<00:00:24.269> figured<00:00:24.660> that<00:00:24.869> we'd<00:00:25.410> only

00:00:25.429 --> 00:00:25.439 
one day so we figured that we'd only

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:27.650 
one day so we figured that we'd only
break<00:00:25.890> half<00:00:26.160> of<00:00:26.310> it<00:00:26.430> and<00:00:26.580> then<00:00:26.730> let<00:00:27.359> the<00:00:27.480> rest

00:00:27.650 --> 00:00:27.660 
break half of it and then let the rest

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:29.089 
break half of it and then let the rest
set<00:00:27.840> for<00:00:28.019> another<00:00:28.109> day<00:00:28.410> and<00:00:28.590> then<00:00:28.859> come

00:00:29.089 --> 00:00:29.099 
set for another day and then come

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:33.130

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:14.090 
rig to pick up so what I'm going to do

00:02:14.090 --> 00:02:16.000 
rig to pick up so what I'm going to do
is<00:02:14.450> now<00:02:14.810> the<00:02:14.870> traps<00:02:15.170> has<00:02:15.380> gone<00:02:15.530> over<00:02:15.830> it<00:02:15.920> the

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:16.010 
is now the traps has gone over it the

00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:17.620 
is now the traps has gone over it the
first<00:02:16.190> time<00:02:16.430> I'm<00:02:17.000> going<00:02:17.120> to<00:02:17.180> take<00:02:17.299> the<00:02:17.450> rake

00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:17.630 
first time I'm going to take the rake

first time I'm going to take the rake
and<00:02:17.930> kind<00:02:18.230> of<00:02:18.349> zigzag<00:02:19.280> back<00:02:19.700> and<00:02:19.760> forth<00:02:19.940> I

00:02:20.289 --> 00:02:20.299 
and kind of zigzag back and forth I

00:02:20.299 --> 00:02:22.690 
and kind of zigzag back and forth I
guess<00:02:20.480> to<00:02:21.410> clean<00:02:21.769> up<00:02:21.890> any<00:02:22.040> of<00:02:22.099> the<00:02:22.190> spots<00:02:22.489> that

00:02:22.690 --> 00:02:22.700 
guess to clean up any of the spots that

00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:27.009 
guess to clean up any of the spots that
hadn't<00:02:23.599> picked<00:02:23.780> up<00:02:23.900> before<00:02:24.049> because<00:02:25.900> it<00:02:26.900> had

00:02:27.009 --> 00:02:27.019 
hadn't picked up before because it had

00:02:27.019 --> 00:02:28.660 
hadn't picked up before because it had
been<00:02:27.200> so<00:02:27.380> thick<00:02:27.650> that<00:02:27.680> the<00:02:28.489> wreck<00:02:28.640> just

00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:28.670 
been so thick that the wreck just

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:30.339 
been so thick that the wreck just
couldn't<00:02:29.060> get<00:02:29.180> to<00:02:29.299> it<00:02:29.329> but<00:02:29.569> now<00:02:29.690> that<00:02:29.720> he's

00:02:30.339 --> 00:02:30.349 
couldn't get to it but now that he's

00:02:30.349 --> 00:02:32.080 
couldn't get to it but now that he's
bailed<00:02:30.590> out<00:02:30.739> most<00:02:30.980> of<00:02:31.069> it<00:02:31.220> I<00:02:31.430> should<00:02:31.940> be<00:02:32.030> able

00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:32.090 
bailed out most of it I should be able

00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:34.539 
bailed out most of it I should be able
to<00:02:32.239> get<00:02:32.329> most<00:02:32.510> of<00:02:32.840> I<00:02:33.190> should<00:02:34.190> be<00:02:34.250> able<00:02:34.310> to<00:02:34.400> pick

00:02:34.539 --> 00:02:34.549

up most say with with a reasonable

00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:40.449 
up most say with with a reasonable
amount<00:02:36.590> of<00:02:36.709> time<00:02:36.920> I<00:02:37.190> think<00:02:38.060> I<00:02:38.420> should<00:02:39.280> get<00:02:40.280> what

I'm not totally sure if I can back this
into<00:07:11.240> the<00:07:11.300> shed<00:07:11.510> because<00:07:11.930> it<00:07:12.860> has<00:07:12.980> a<00:07:13.010> really

00:07:13.240 --> 00:07:13.250 
into the shed because it has a really

00:07:13.250 --> 00:07:16.830 
into the shed because it has a really
short<00:07:13.340> tongue<00:07:14.020> and<00:07:15.020> it's<00:07:15.140> really<00:07:15.410> heavy<00:07:15.710> so

00:07:16.830 --> 00:07:16.840 
short tongue and it's really heavy so

00:07:16.840 --> 00:07:19.630 
short tongue and it's really heavy so
I'm<00:07:17.840> just<00:07:17.930> gonna<00:07:18.050> try<00:07:18.410> and<00:07:18.440> see<00:07:19.250> what<00:07:19.340> comes<00:07:19.520> a

00:07:19.630 --> 00:07:19.640 
I'm just gonna try and see what comes a

00:07:19.640 --> 00:07:21.810 
I'm just gonna try and see what comes a
bit

00:07:21.810 --> 00:07:21.820 

00:07:21.820 --> 00:07:38.970 

looking<00:07:22.480> good<00:07:22.570> so<00:07:22.630> far

00:07:38.970 --> 00:07:38.980 

00:07:38.980 --> 00:07:42.180 

that<00:07:39.550> was<00:07:39.640> kind<00:07:39.820> of<00:07:39.880> surprising
