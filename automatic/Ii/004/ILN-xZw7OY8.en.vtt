00:00:06.210 --> 00:00:10.350
 well we started the tutorial for the 

00:00:08.670 --> 00:00:11.969
 installation of the patch as I had 

00:00:10.350 --> 00:00:14.040
 mentioned is very similar to the way 

00:00:11.969 --> 00:00:16.260
 How to install a file option 

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:19.290
 equipment to import putting that not 

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:21.919
 we know these things or we will get a 

00:00:19.290 --> 00:00:24.360
 usb to configure it here in the xbox 

00:00:21.919 --> 00:00:26.669
 let's be the three boxes and put our 

00:00:24.360 --> 00:00:30.290
 usb and we go to the optimal option of 

00:00:26.669 --> 00:00:33.870
 configuration in storage systems 

00:00:30.290 --> 00:00:36.630
 and it will detect our memory there 

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:38.160
 going to say external memory unit we 

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:43.350
 we go to this one and we give it to him with the button 

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:46.019
 yellow to configure us the new 

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:47.960
 usb that we just put there will come out 

00:00:46.019 --> 00:00:49.940
 the configure option 

00:00:47.960 --> 00:00:53.180
 after this I advise you to look for your 

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:54.800
 profile to copy it to usb we are going to 

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:57.050
 where they have them saved either in 

00:00:54.800 --> 00:00:59.239
 internal memory unit of the xbox or 

00:00:57.050 --> 00:01:02.059
 on the hard disk in this case in the 

00:00:59.239 --> 00:01:04.309
 hard disk in profiles is already through 

00:01:02.059 --> 00:01:06.000
 with the yellow button does not light me 

00:01:04.309 --> 00:01:10.200
 options 

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:13.830
 copy delete or move in this case the 

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:16.830
 we copy the usb already in the pcm we have 

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:18.930
 our usb and I recommend you download the 

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:21.570
 hobby program are to put the 

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:23.400
 patch files or even others 

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:25.200
 box files or is this useful 

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:27.810
 tool and you have installed the 

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:29.520
 tool we go to the option says 

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:32.520
 up there where the arrow is 

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:35.670
 injected file 

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:38.009
 to put the files of the pair is going to 

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:40.049
 leave the folder where you have 

00:01:38.009 --> 00:01:42.630
 extracted looks for it in the folder where 

00:01:40.049 --> 00:01:44.060
 you had extracted the archives of 

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:47.210
 patch 

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:49.909
 Once this is done we will direct the 

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:51.860
 files to put in there was going to be a 

00:01:49.909 --> 00:01:54.350
 point that I want to mention in having 

00:01:51.860 --> 00:01:57.530
 account for the installation to be of 

00:01:54.350 --> 00:02:01.159
 the correct way and the option will come out 

00:01:57.530 --> 00:02:03.740
 use this profile or skip this step to 

00:02:01.159 --> 00:02:06.409
 all files except the edit 

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:08.420
 point bin listened to exception of the edit 

00:02:06.409 --> 00:02:11.150
 point well you get skipped this step 

00:02:08.420 --> 00:02:14.569
 for the edith point bin get in 

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:17.000
 use this profile as it is useful so that 

00:02:14.569 --> 00:02:21.030
 are the installation correct form if not 

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:23.910
 they do it like this they will not read the patch 

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:27.390
 the fish is going to be as if they did not have it 

00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:30.600
 It is necessary that you follow these steps to 

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:33.690
 the letter so that the reading of the 

00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:36.390
 Fish patch is correct 

00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:39.940
 and he has done this after we go to 

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:43.030
 the xbox metanse usb to xbox 

00:02:39.940 --> 00:02:45.160
 and we're going to go there to the hard drive I'm going to 

00:02:43.030 --> 00:02:47.860
 show them that they have to first 

00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:51.970
 nothing delete their files and they already have 

00:02:47.860 --> 00:02:54.640
 another patch if not then obviously not 

00:02:51.970 --> 00:02:56.710
 is going to say that over write if not but 

00:02:54.640 --> 00:02:58.180
 If so, I recommend you save your 

00:02:56.710 --> 00:03:02.960
 old patches 

00:02:58.180 --> 00:03:05.480
 for example the add-on patch wolves 

00:03:02.960 --> 00:03:09.290
 and another interesting point is that what 

00:03:05.480 --> 00:03:11.900
 yes they have all is a the cap that is a 

00:03:09.290 --> 00:03:14.840
 very small file that weighs 

00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:17.180
 kb does not even get this if they delete it 

00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:21.069
 whatever the patch they go to 

00:03:17.180 --> 00:03:24.099
 install it delete it get delete 

00:03:21.069 --> 00:03:27.159
 and I'm not going to do it so you say 

00:03:24.099 --> 00:03:29.139
 when installing the pass they give you delete already 

00:03:27.159 --> 00:03:32.139
 that they have done these steps 

00:03:29.139 --> 00:03:36.519
 eliminate the important payment tata we 

00:03:32.139 --> 00:03:39.000
 we direct to the usb and logically what 

00:03:36.519 --> 00:03:42.969
 they imagine we are going to copy the files 

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:44.920
 one by one the led and came to edit 

00:03:42.969 --> 00:03:47.409
 data I did not say that they deleted it because that 

00:03:44.920 --> 00:03:49.450
 if nothing happens like that what about write if 

00:03:47.409 --> 00:03:52.180
 they give copy to that is and about which I have 

00:03:49.450 --> 00:03:55.419
 seen data and the set and everything else if the 

00:03:52.180 --> 00:03:58.419
 they make good this is all 

00:03:55.419 --> 00:04:00.250
 maybe I missed something I do not remember but if 

00:03:58.419 --> 00:04:04.560
 that 's if it did not work for them they can leave 

00:04:00.250 --> 00:04:04.560
 your comments we'll see you next time
