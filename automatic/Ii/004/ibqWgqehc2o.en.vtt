and there's the like I don't think
that's<00:03:34.660> Gigabit<00:03:35.200> Ethernet<00:03:35.670> again<00:03:36.670> someone

00:03:36.900 --> 00:03:36.910 
that's Gigabit Ethernet again someone

00:03:36.910 --> 00:03:41.430 
that's Gigabit Ethernet again someone
before<00:03:37.030> that<00:03:37.620> power<00:03:38.620> cord<00:03:40.019> all<00:03:41.019> that<00:03:41.140> stuff

00:03:41.430 --> 00:03:41.440 
before that power cord all that stuff

00:03:41.440 --> 00:03:47.100 
before that power cord all that stuff
for<00:03:42.130> controllers<00:03:42.610> I<00:03:43.769> was<00:03:44.769> in<00:03:44.860> a<00:03:44.890> power<00:03:45.160> but<00:03:46.110> man

00:03:47.100 --> 00:03:47.110 
for controllers I was in a power but man

00:03:47.110 --> 00:03:49.650 
for controllers I was in a power but man
this<00:03:47.380> thing<00:03:47.560> is<00:03:47.680> heavy<00:03:48.030> this<00:03:49.030> thing's<00:03:49.269> heavy

00:03:49.650 --> 00:03:49.660

I<00:03:50.700> mean<00:03:51.700> I<00:03:51.790> think<00:03:51.970> game<00:03:52.209> consoles<00:03:52.750> so<00:03:52.930> much

00:03:53.100 --> 00:03:53.110 
I mean I think game consoles so much

00:03:53.110 --> 00:04:02.699 
I mean I think game consoles so much
smaller<00:03:53.680> now<00:03:58.920> okay<00:04:01.470> yeah

00:04:02.699 --> 00:04:02.709 
smaller now okay yeah

00:04:02.709 --> 00:04:08.280 
smaller now okay yeah
looks<00:04:02.890> fine<00:04:03.250> to<00:04:03.310> me<00:04:04.440> and<00:04:06.330> this<00:04:07.330> thing<00:04:07.569> is<00:04:07.600> IDE

00:04:08.280 --> 00:04:08.290 
looks fine to me and this thing is IDE

00:04:08.290 --> 00:04:10.920 
looks fine to me and this thing is IDE
which<00:04:09.069> some<00:04:10.060> of<00:04:10.090> you<00:04:10.269> may<00:04:10.450> not<00:04:10.570> even<00:04:10.720> know<00:04:10.900> what

00:04:10.920 --> 00:04:10.930 
which some of you may not even know what

00:04:10.930 --> 00:04:14.180 
which some of you may not even know what
that<00:04:11.110> is<00:04:11.320> it's<00:04:12.010> before<00:04:12.610> SATA<00:04:13.180> on<00:04:13.390> hard<00:04:13.690> drives

00:04:14.180 --> 00:04:14.190 
that is it's before SATA on hard drives

00:04:14.190 --> 00:04:17.219 
that is it's before SATA on hard drives
and<00:04:15.190> ask<00:04:15.610> you're<00:04:15.790> one<00:04:15.910> of<00:04:15.970> the<00:04:16.060> slowest<00:04:16.600> has<00:04:17.049> to

00:04:17.219 --> 00:04:17.229 
and ask you're one of the slowest has to

00:04:17.229 --> 00:04:21.930 
and ask you're one of the slowest has to
be<00:04:17.290> the<00:04:17.380> slowest<00:04:18.030> data<00:04:19.030> transfer<00:04:19.630> cables<00:04:20.940> that

00:04:21.930 --> 00:04:21.940 
be the slowest data transfer cables that

00:04:21.940 --> 00:04:25.050 
be the slowest data transfer cables that
is<00:04:22.260> to<00:04:23.260> this<00:04:23.380> day<00:04:23.590> now<00:04:23.800> but<00:04:24.520> that's<00:04:24.729> what<00:04:24.910> this

00:04:25.050 --> 00:04:25.060 
is to this day now but that's what this

00:04:25.060 --> 00:04:28.440 
is to this day now but that's what this
is<00:04:25.240> off<00:04:25.590> than<00:04:26.590> it<00:04:26.740> was<00:04:26.890> I<00:04:27.400> think<00:04:27.640> was<00:04:27.820> SATA<00:04:28.150> on

00:04:28.440 --> 00:04:28.450 
is off than it was I think was SATA on

00:04:28.450 --> 00:04:31.620 
is off than it was I think was SATA on
the<00:04:28.810> 316<00:04:29.440> then<00:04:29.650> I<00:04:30.030> mean<00:04:31.030> this<00:04:31.120> is<00:04:31.240> one<00:04:31.360> of<00:04:31.450> last

00:04:31.620 --> 00:04:31.630 
the 316 then I mean this is one of last

00:04:31.630 --> 00:04:33.960 
the 316 then I mean this is one of last
councils<00:04:32.140> to<00:04:32.229> have<00:04:32.350> IDE<00:04:32.890> ports<00:04:33.280> so<00:04:33.460> I<00:04:33.669> think

00:04:33.960 --> 00:04:33.970 
councils to have IDE ports so I think

00:04:33.970 --> 00:04:36.719 
councils to have IDE ports so I think
I'm<00:04:34.090> gonna<00:04:34.180> buy<00:04:34.419> a<00:04:34.740> 500<00:04:35.740> gig<00:04:35.950> hard<00:04:35.979> drive<00:04:36.280> and

00:04:36.719 --> 00:04:36.729 
I'm gonna buy a 500 gig hard drive and

00:04:36.729 --> 00:04:42.120 
I'm gonna buy a 500 gig hard drive and
just<00:04:38.310> put<00:04:39.310> a<00:04:39.340> ton<00:04:39.700> of<00:04:39.729> stuff<00:04:40.000> on<00:04:40.150> it<00:04:40.330> but<00:04:41.320> that

00:04:42.120 --> 00:04:42.130 
just put a ton of stuff on it but that

00:04:42.130 --> 00:04:43.940 
just put a ton of stuff on it but that
grid<00:04:42.400> videos<00:04:42.789> would<00:04:42.970> be<00:04:43.060> coming<00:04:43.210> soon<00:04:43.510> and

00:04:43.940 --> 00:04:43.950 
grid videos would be coming soon and
