00:00:06.620 --> 00:00:10.799
 last hack photo we already 

00:00:08.850 --> 00:00:12.660
 talked about how to shoot macro without 

00:00:10.799 --> 00:00:14.280
 special lenses cost only 

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:16.170
 fasten the macro ring 

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:18.599
 but you can shoot the microcosm and using 

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:20.790
 special light filters large lens 

00:00:18.599 --> 00:00:21.810
 plan or as they are called filter 

00:00:20.790 --> 00:00:23.490
 close up 

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:25.050
 This is a special kind of light filter which 

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:25.710
 winding up in front of the front lens 

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:28.650
 lens 

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:30.600
 in fact, this is a common magnifying principle. 

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:32.790
 magnifying such glass is quite simple 

00:00:30.600 --> 00:00:34.710
 macro filter reduces effective 

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:36.540
 focal length of any lens 

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:38.670
 therefore increase 

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:40.320
 labeling grows accordingly 

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:42.000
 These filters are standard for 

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:42.660
 magnifying glasses indicated in 

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:44.460
 diopters 

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:47.129
 those most used in 

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:48.780
 ophthalmology microscopy and other diode 

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:50.670
 when is equal to the multiplication factor 

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:52.440
 lens magnification 

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:54.960
 standard macro has 

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:57.239
 marking from 2 to 5 diopters with a mark 

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:58.800
 plus of course you can use more 

00:00:57.239 --> 00:01:01.079
 light filters to increase 

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:02.969
 coefficient but first itâ€™s worth remembering 

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:04.649
 what is the increase in diopter 

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:07.320
 the light filter significantly reduces 

00:01:04.649 --> 00:01:09.810
 picture quality 56 units perfectly 

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:12.000
 For the most time in the second if the macro ring 

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:13.799
 provided greater increase with briefly 

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:14.430
 focal lenses then everything 

00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:16.590
 vice versa 

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:17.880
 TV and will give a larger picture 

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:20.580
 ok standard focal lens 

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:21.299
 a distance of 50 millimeters and an increase 

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:23.400
 015 

00:01:21.299 --> 00:01:25.680
 x3 filters with a value of 5 diopters 

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:28.680
 get effective focal length 

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:30.630
 40 millimeters and magnification 0 44 x 

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:33.119
 a telephoto with a focal length of 200 

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:35.250
 millimeters and an increase of 0 15 x at 

00:01:33.119 --> 00:01:38.310
 using 53 different filters already 

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:40.530
 get an increase of 132 x and effective 

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:42.630
 focal length 100 millimeters to that 

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:44.520
 the opportunity will be a huge plus 

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:46.380
 focus on distant objects yes 

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:49.020
 and no change in aperture too 

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:51.030
 cool f-28 will skip so much 

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:53.340
 how much light and should but there is 

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:55.740
 several drawbacks for example buying 

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:57.540
 filter for lenses to diameter 77 

00:01:55.740 --> 00:02:00.119
 millimeters u will not be able to take off 

00:01:57.540 --> 00:02:01.619
 lens diameter of 50 millimeters in 

00:02:00.119 --> 00:02:03.210
 second, these lenses change little 

00:02:01.619 --> 00:02:05.729
 zoom lenses with focal 

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:07.710
 distance below 80 millimeters so 

00:02:05.729 --> 00:02:09.450
 despite the compactness will have to drag 

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:11.340
 for not a small TV well and 

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:12.840
 the rest is optional optical 

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:14.640
 element unless of course it is multi 

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:16.709
 coated glass does not add 

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:17.240
 higher image quality 

00:02:16.709 --> 00:02:19.070
 the cost 

00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:20.870
 difference from the same rings impossibility 

00:02:19.070 --> 00:02:23.270
 install some other filters 

00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:25.070
 instances will have to choose but if 

00:02:23.270 --> 00:02:27.290
 all this does not stop you to shoot 

00:02:25.070 --> 00:02:28.400
 macro really want a macro ring you 

00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:30.230
 something does not suit 

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:32.270
 and buying a special macro lens 

00:02:30.230 --> 00:02:35.920
 until your plans come in then 

00:02:32.270 --> 00:02:35.920
 macro filter exactly for you
