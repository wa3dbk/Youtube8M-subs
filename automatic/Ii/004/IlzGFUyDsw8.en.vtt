00:02:30.580 --> 00:02:30.590 
taken out of it hey Jake see at first I

00:02:30.590 --> 00:02:32.890 
taken out of it hey Jake see at first I
just<00:02:30.620> had<00:02:31.070> one<00:02:31.280> set<00:02:31.640> of<00:02:31.790> gates<00:02:32.030> separating<00:02:32.780> the

00:02:32.890 --> 00:02:32.900 
just had one set of gates separating the

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:35.590 
just had one set of gates separating the
two<00:02:33.110> dogs<00:02:33.340> but<00:02:34.340> they<00:02:34.580> managed<00:02:35.030> to<00:02:35.299> fight

00:02:35.590 --> 00:02:35.600 
two dogs but they managed to fight

00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:38.110 
two dogs but they managed to fight
through<00:02:36.110> the<00:02:36.320> gates<00:02:36.560> and<00:02:36.920> they<00:02:37.130> actually<00:02:37.760> got

00:02:38.110 --> 00:02:38.120 
through the gates and they actually got

00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:40.360 
through the gates and they actually got
ahold<00:02:38.480> of<00:02:38.750> one<00:02:38.810> another<00:02:39.290> through<00:02:39.920> the<00:02:39.950> little

00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:40.370 
ahold of one another through the little

00:02:40.370 --> 00:02:44.050 
ahold of one another through the little
slots<00:02:40.850> here<00:02:41.630> so<00:02:42.200> now<00:02:42.440> I<00:02:42.470> keep<00:02:43.100> two<00:02:43.579> sets<00:02:43.910> of

00:02:44.050 --> 00:02:44.060 
slots here so now I keep two sets of

00:02:44.060 --> 00:02:47.880 
slots here so now I keep two sets of
gates<00:02:44.680> my<00:02:45.680> life<00:02:46.010> is<00:02:46.310> spent<00:02:46.549> thinking<00:02:46.760> about

00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:47.890 
gates my life is spent thinking about

00:02:47.890 --> 00:02:52.600 
gates my life is spent thinking about

00:02:52.600 --> 00:02:52.610

I<00:03:03.500> would<00:03:04.250> think<00:03:04.489> Oh<00:03:04.580> enough<00:03:05.000> times<00:03:05.269> past<00:03:05.599> I'm

00:03:05.830 --> 00:03:05.840 
I would think Oh enough times past I'm

00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:08.470 
I would think Oh enough times past I'm
sure<00:03:05.870> they're<00:03:06.349> over<00:03:06.860> there<00:03:07.099> issues<00:03:07.730> the<00:03:08.269> guard

00:03:08.470 --> 00:03:08.480 
sure they're over there issues the guard

00:03:08.480 --> 00:03:11.710 
sure they're over there issues the guard
goes<00:03:08.690> down<00:03:08.959> the<00:03:09.650> dogs<00:03:09.890> go<00:03:10.099> at<00:03:10.280> it<00:03:10.540> I'm<00:03:11.540> afraid

00:03:11.710 --> 00:03:11.720 
goes down the dogs go at it I'm afraid

00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:13.600 
goes down the dogs go at it I'm afraid
they're<00:03:11.959> gonna<00:03:12.019> kill<00:03:12.290> each<00:03:12.319> other<00:03:12.590> it<00:03:13.370> would

00:03:13.600 --> 00:03:13.610 
they're gonna kill each other it would

00:03:13.610 --> 00:03:15.910 
they're gonna kill each other it would
happen<00:03:13.879> this<00:03:14.299> isn't<00:03:14.959> about<00:03:15.049> winning<00:03:15.349> it's

about killing the other one that is the

about killing the other one that is the
