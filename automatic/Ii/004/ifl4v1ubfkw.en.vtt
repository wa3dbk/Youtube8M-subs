00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:36.300 
and like there's no way to be completely

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:37.819 
and like there's no way to be completely
prepared<00:00:36.690> for<00:00:36.809> the<00:00:36.960> responsibility<00:00:37.649> until

00:00:37.819 --> 00:00:37.829 
prepared for the responsibility until

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:42.150 
prepared for the responsibility until
you<00:00:37.980> take<00:00:38.160> it<00:00:38.280> on<00:00:38.370> as<00:00:38.579> hurts<00:00:38.730> muddle<00:00:39.059> through

00:00:42.150 --> 00:00:42.160 

00:00:42.160 --> 00:00:44.550 

it<00:00:42.820> can<00:00:43.120> add<00:00:43.420> up<00:00:43.600> having<00:00:43.900> a<00:00:43.960> dog<00:00:44.140> if<00:00:44.350> you<00:00:44.440> have<00:00:44.530> a

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:44.560 
it can add up having a dog if you have a

00:00:44.560 --> 00:00:46.590 
it can add up having a dog if you have a
dog<00:00:44.770> like<00:00:45.310> pure<00:00:45.610> breed<00:00:45.820> dogs<00:00:46.030> lots<00:00:46.270> of<00:00:46.390> times

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:46.600 
dog like pure breed dogs lots of times

00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:48.000 
dog like pure breed dogs lots of times
can<00:00:46.840> have<00:00:46.989> health<00:00:47.200> problems<00:00:47.260> and<00:00:47.860> so<00:00:47.950> you

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:48.010 
can have health problems and so you

00:00:48.010 --> 00:00:49.740 
can have health problems and so you
requires<00:00:48.580> a<00:00:48.670> lot<00:00:48.820> more<00:00:48.850> visits<00:00:49.210> to<00:00:49.270> the<00:00:49.420> vet<00:00:49.540> it

00:00:49.740 --> 00:00:49.750 
requires a lot more visits to the vet it

00:00:49.750 --> 00:00:51.930 
requires a lot more visits to the vet it
really<00:00:50.230> completely<00:00:50.620> ranges<00:00:51.100> what<00:00:51.700> I<00:00:51.730> would

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:51.940 
really completely ranges what I would

00:00:51.940 --> 00:00:53.160 
really completely ranges what I would
suggest<00:00:52.090> doing<00:00:52.330> is<00:00:52.660> that<00:00:52.780> if<00:00:52.870> you're<00:00:52.960> thinking

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:53.170 
suggest doing is that if you're thinking

00:00:53.170 --> 00:00:54.299 
suggest doing is that if you're thinking
about<00:00:53.230> getting<00:00:53.410> a<00:00:53.590> pet<00:00:53.739> or<00:00:53.920> getting<00:00:54.070> a<00:00:54.160> dog

00:00:54.299 --> 00:00:54.309 
about getting a pet or getting a dog

00:00:54.309 --> 00:00:56.580 
about getting a pet or getting a dog
look<00:00:55.270> into<00:00:55.540> the<00:00:55.660> different<00:00:55.930> kinds<00:00:56.200> of<00:00:56.260> breeds

00:00:56.580 --> 00:00:56.590 
look into the different kinds of breeds

00:00:56.590 --> 00:00:57.810 
look into the different kinds of breeds
which<00:00:56.890> ones<00:00:57.129> tend<00:00:57.489> to<00:00:57.550> have<00:00:57.640> more<00:00:57.760> health

00:00:57.810 --> 00:00:57.820 
which ones tend to have more health

00:00:57.820 --> 00:01:00.380 
which ones tend to have more health
problems<00:00:58.269> which<00:00:58.330> don't<00:00:58.690> I<00:00:59.040> personally<00:01:00.040> think

00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:00.390 
problems which don't I personally think

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:02.939 
problems which don't I personally think
adopting<00:01:01.390> mud<00:01:01.660> is<00:01:02.080> the<00:01:02.230> best<00:01:02.440> because<00:01:02.680> they

00:01:02.939 --> 00:01:02.949 
adopting mud is the best because they

00:01:02.949 --> 00:01:07.290 
adopting mud is the best because they
are<00:01:03.129> saving<00:01:03.460> and<00:01:03.699> adorable<00:01:04.410> Laurie<00:01:05.410> and<00:01:06.300> they

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:07.300 
are saving and adorable Laurie and they

00:01:07.300 --> 00:01:11.090 
are saving and adorable Laurie and they
tend<00:01:07.510> to<00:01:07.540> be<00:01:07.660> healthier

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:11.100 

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:13.969 

I<00:01:11.159> don't<00:01:11.939> know<00:01:12.030> if<00:01:12.119> you<00:01:12.180> can<00:01:12.330> see<00:01:12.900> here<00:01:13.229> with

00:01:13.969 --> 00:01:13.979 
I don't know if you can see here with

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:15.679 
I don't know if you can see here with
Luca<00:01:14.400> it's<00:01:14.820> pretty<00:01:15.119> difficult

00:01:15.679 --> 00:01:15.689 
Luca it's pretty difficult

00:01:15.689 --> 00:01:17.719 
Luca it's pretty difficult
I<00:01:15.720> could<00:01:16.229> easily<00:01:16.380> vacuum<00:01:16.979> every<00:01:17.310> single<00:01:17.610> day

00:01:17.719 --> 00:01:17.729 
I could easily vacuum every single day

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:21.499 
I could easily vacuum every single day
Luca<00:01:18.090> sheds<00:01:18.830> like<00:01:19.830> a<00:01:20.100> mofo<00:01:20.580> she's<00:01:21.000> a<00:01:21.119> very

00:01:21.499 --> 00:01:21.509 
Luca sheds like a mofo she's a very

00:01:21.509 --> 00:01:24.050 
Luca sheds like a mofo she's a very
thick<00:01:21.840> undercoat<00:01:22.200> that<00:01:22.409> just<00:01:22.830> comes<00:01:23.520> off<00:01:23.729> all

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:24.060 
thick undercoat that just comes off all

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:24.800 
thick undercoat that just comes off all
over<00:01:24.119> you

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:24.810 
over you

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:29.660 
over you
so<00:01:25.200> I'm<00:01:25.409> covered<00:01:25.979> right<00:01:26.250> now

00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:29.670 

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:31.679 

if<00:01:30.670> anything<00:01:31.000> I<00:01:31.090> think<00:01:31.149> getting<00:01:31.390> a<00:01:31.509> pet

00:01:31.679 --> 00:01:31.689 
if anything I think getting a pet

00:01:31.689 --> 00:01:33.660 
if anything I think getting a pet
actually<00:01:32.140> is<00:01:32.320> great<00:01:32.799> for<00:01:32.979> a<00:01:33.009> relationship<00:01:33.429> if

00:01:33.660 --> 00:01:33.670 
actually is great for a relationship if

00:01:33.670 --> 00:01:34.440 
actually is great for a relationship if
you're<00:01:33.789> really<00:01:33.909> meant<00:01:34.149> to<00:01:34.210> be<00:01:34.299> together

00:01:34.440 --> 00:01:34.450 
you're really meant to be together

00:01:34.450 --> 00:01:36.810 
you're really meant to be together
because<00:01:34.780> it's<00:01:35.469> sort<00:01:35.679> of<00:01:35.770> the<00:01:35.829> first<00:01:36.159> step<00:01:36.490> to

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:36.820 
because it's sort of the first step to

00:01:36.820 --> 00:01:38.520 
because it's sort of the first step to
seeing<00:01:37.119> whether<00:01:37.270> or<00:01:37.420> not<00:01:37.570> maybe<00:01:38.200> you<00:01:38.350> want

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:38.530 
seeing whether or not maybe you want

00:01:38.530 --> 00:01:41.459 
seeing whether or not maybe you want
kids<00:01:38.859> and<00:01:39.670> seeing<00:01:40.509> how<00:01:40.630> you<00:01:40.689> take<00:01:40.960> care<00:01:41.200> of<00:01:41.229> a

00:01:41.459 --> 00:01:41.469 
kids and seeing how you take care of a

00:01:41.469 --> 00:01:43.859 
kids and seeing how you take care of a
like<00:01:42.250> an<00:01:42.819> animal<00:01:43.119> together<00:01:43.390> and<00:01:43.539> how<00:01:43.600> you<00:01:43.659> take

00:01:43.859 --> 00:01:43.869 
like an animal together and how you take

00:01:43.869 --> 00:01:45.660 
like an animal together and how you take
care<00:01:44.079> of<00:01:44.170> like<00:01:44.380> take<00:01:44.770> on<00:01:44.890> the<00:01:44.979> responsibility

00:01:45.660 --> 00:01:45.670 
care of like take on the responsibility

00:01:45.670 --> 00:01:47.760 
care of like take on the responsibility
and<00:01:45.789> how<00:01:45.880> well<00:01:46.090> you<00:01:46.240> split<00:01:46.600> the<00:01:46.840> the<00:01:47.110> different

00:01:47.760 --> 00:01:47.770 
and how well you split the the different

00:01:47.770 --> 00:01:49.109 
and how well you split the the different
duties<00:01:48.069> and<00:01:48.280> stuff<00:01:48.490> like<00:01:48.670> that<00:01:48.819> I<00:01:48.850> think<00:01:48.909> it

00:01:49.109 --> 00:01:49.119 
duties and stuff like that I think it

00:01:49.119 --> 00:01:50.190 
duties and stuff like that I think it
can<00:01:49.240> illuminate<00:01:49.689> things<00:01:49.959> in<00:01:50.110> your

00:01:50.190 --> 00:01:50.200 
can illuminate things in your

00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:52.139 
can illuminate things in your
relationship<00:01:50.429> so<00:01:51.429> I<00:01:51.700> think<00:01:51.880> it<00:01:52.060> actually
