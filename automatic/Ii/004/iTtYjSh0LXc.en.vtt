PVC or something he fuses has it fused

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:11.570 
PVC or something he fuses has it fused
together<00:01:09.659> so<00:01:10.290> that<00:01:10.320> the<00:01:10.530> seams<00:01:10.830> don't<00:01:11.159> split

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:11.580 
together so that the seams don't split

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:14.390 
together so that the seams don't split
they<00:01:12.270> don't<00:01:12.479> rip<00:01:12.720> open<00:01:12.930> you<00:01:13.380> can't<00:01:13.650> really

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:14.400 
they don't rip open you can't really

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:16.370 
they don't rip open you can't really
damaged<00:01:14.880> it<00:01:15.030> and<00:01:15.180> it<00:01:15.270> really<00:01:15.450> strengthens<00:01:15.930> the

00:01:16.370 --> 00:01:16.380 
damaged it and it really strengthens the

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:18.289 
damaged it and it really strengthens the
bag<00:01:16.590> so<00:01:16.890> you've<00:01:17.009> got<00:01:17.040> two<00:01:17.340> pieces<00:01:17.790> together

00:01:18.289 --> 00:01:18.299

00:01:18.299 --> 00:01:21.410 
bag so you've got two pieces together
stitched<00:01:19.170> and<00:01:19.500> then<00:01:20.130> it's<00:01:20.310> fused<00:01:20.790> or<00:01:21.090> sealed

00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:21.420

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:25.190 
stitched and then it's fused or sealed
heat-sealed<00:01:22.200> somehow<00:01:22.770> and<00:01:23.100> it's<00:01:23.850> a<00:01:24.200> really

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:25.200 
heat-sealed somehow and it's a really

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:27.050 
heat-sealed somehow and it's a really
really<00:01:25.470> good<00:01:25.740> quality<00:01:26.310> like<00:01:26.670> I<00:01:26.820> said<00:01:26.880> I
