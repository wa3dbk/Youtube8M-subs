benchmarking skills this isn't quite a
good<00:00:40.860> comparison<00:00:41.219> because<00:00:41.489> you've<00:00:42.030> got<00:00:42.090> a<00:00:42.149> 1.7

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:43.110

00:00:45.979 --> 00:00:45.989 
gigahertz processor in the HTC one

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:50.240 
gigahertz processor in the HTC one
against<00:00:46.559> the<00:00:46.710> Apple<00:00:47.370> iPhone<00:00:47.520> which<00:00:48.030> is<00:00:48.300> a<00:00:49.250> 1.3

00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:50.250

against the Apple iPhone which is a 1.3
Gertz<00:00:50.730> processor<00:00:51.270> but<00:00:51.719> this<00:00:51.989> is<00:00:52.199> a<00:00:52.230> great

00:00:52.490 --> 00:00:52.500 
Gertz processor but this is a great

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:54.290 
Gertz processor but this is a great
comparison<00:00:52.860> so<00:00:53.219> you<00:00:53.430> can<00:00:53.579> see<00:00:53.820> the<00:00:53.969> difference

00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:54.300 
comparison so you can see the difference

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:56.779 
comparison so you can see the difference
between<00:00:54.719> the<00:00:54.840> two<00:00:54.989> and<00:00:55.230> how<00:00:55.949> they<00:00:56.160> compete<00:00:56.610> and

between the two and how they compete and

00:00:56.789 --> 00:00:58.369 
between the two and how they compete and
maybe<00:00:57.210> which<00:00:57.480> phone<00:00:57.719> you<00:00:57.750> might<00:00:57.989> want<00:00:58.170> to<00:00:58.260> pick

00:00:58.369 --> 00:00:58.379 
maybe which phone you might want to pick

00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:20.670 
run some benchmarks between these two

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:23.899 
run some benchmarks between these two
devices<00:01:20.880> now<00:01:21.630> like<00:01:21.810> I<00:01:21.930> said<00:01:21.960> given<00:01:22.950> obviously

the<00:01:24.060> faster<00:01:24.540> processor<00:01:25.110> is<00:01:25.439> going<00:01:26.189> to<00:01:26.490> win

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:26.970 
the faster processor is going to win

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:29.600

this<00:01:27.360> sort<00:01:27.720> of<00:01:27.780> race<00:01:28.080> one<00:01:28.799> thing<00:01:29.460> that's

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:29.610 
this sort of race one thing that's

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:31.700 
this sort of race one thing that's
interesting<00:01:29.759> is<00:01:30.119> the<00:01:30.299> HTC<00:01:30.659> is<00:01:31.140> a<00:01:31.170> brand<00:01:31.530> new

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:31.710 
interesting is the HTC is a brand new

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:33.920 
interesting is the HTC is a brand new
phone<00:01:31.950> just<00:01:31.979> newly<00:01:32.340> to<00:01:32.610> the<00:01:32.700> market<00:01:33.060> probably

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:33.930 
phone just newly to the market probably

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:37.850 
phone just newly to the market probably
thin<00:01:34.110> the<00:01:34.950> next<00:01:35.250> for<00:01:35.729> six<00:01:36.030> months<00:01:36.360> maybe<00:01:37.170> 22<00:01:37.530> I

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:37.860 
thin the next for six months maybe 22 I

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:39.399 
thin the next for six months maybe 22 I
should<00:01:38.310> probably<00:01:38.400> say<00:01:38.640> two<00:01:38.850> to<00:01:38.880> six<00:01:39.180> months

00:01:39.399 --> 00:01:39.409 
should probably say two to six months

00:01:39.409 --> 00:01:42.980 
should probably say two to six months
the<00:01:40.520> Apple<00:01:41.520> iPhone<00:01:41.670> will<00:01:42.299> be<00:01:42.420> updated<00:01:42.899> with

00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:42.990 
the Apple iPhone will be updated with

whatever they decide to call it and
hopefully<00:01:48.030> it<00:01:48.240> will<00:01:48.299> be<00:01:48.450> faster<00:01:48.990> given<00:01:49.770> where

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:50.340 
hopefully it will be faster given where

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:51.950 
hopefully it will be faster given where
it's<00:01:50.520> at<00:01:50.729> in<00:01:50.939> some<00:01:51.180> of<00:01:51.270> its<00:01:51.360> benchmarking

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:51.960 
it's at in some of its benchmarking
