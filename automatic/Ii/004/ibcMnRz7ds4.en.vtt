00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:28.429
 Shedding avalanches are dramatic 

00:00:26.689 --> 00:00:28.910
 You do not experience events for a lifetime 

00:00:28.429 --> 00:00:32.119
 forgets 

00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:34.399
 despite panic, you have to be afraid and stress 

00:00:32.119 --> 00:00:35.899
 still only preserve peace then you can 

00:00:34.399 --> 00:00:36.980
 the vital right ones 

00:00:35.899 --> 00:00:39.260
 make decisions 

00:00:36.980 --> 00:00:41.809
 the top priority in every case is the 

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:44.149
 safety of the rescuer avalanche danger or 

00:00:41.809 --> 00:00:44.570
 the danger of after avalanches has to be considered 

00:00:44.149 --> 00:00:46.730
 become 

00:00:44.570 --> 00:00:48.909
 in the tower terrain may no 

00:00:46.730 --> 00:00:51.350
 increased risk 

00:00:48.909 --> 00:00:53.360
 the serious one the biggest 

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:55.940
 Competence has taken over the complete 

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:57.920
 Organization of all rescuers is important 

00:00:55.940 --> 00:00:59.570
 that all did not immediately spill her 

00:00:57.920 --> 00:01:01.039
 lvs device look around 

00:00:59.570 --> 00:01:03.050
 otherwise the search will be the 

00:01:01.039 --> 00:01:05.390
 actual spills made difficult 

00:01:03.050 --> 00:01:07.550
 a group member immediately sets the 

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:09.679
 call off if your situation is possible 

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:11.390
 and then supports the or 

00:01:09.679 --> 00:01:14.210
 the other savior with but looks 

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:15.619
 if I'm not lucky 

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:18.409
 snowboard was captured 

00:01:15.619 --> 00:01:20.360
 then i watch my partner and 

00:01:18.409 --> 00:01:22.670
 I notice as far as possible in disappearing point 

00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:25.399
 At this point I start the search 

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:26.840
 down so only a few mostly one 

00:01:25.399 --> 00:01:29.630
 Do not compare and then I am amazed 

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:31.759
 down in the spout area together and ever 

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:32.950
 after terrain is then autobereich those 

00:01:31.759 --> 00:01:35.689
 search first 

00:01:32.950 --> 00:01:38.030
 when i am alone i am looking for the field 

00:01:35.689 --> 00:01:38.509
 in the form of me another 20 meters 

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:42.170
 distance 

00:01:38.509 --> 00:01:45.020
 I hold the device horizontally from 

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:47.710
 body at the same time I smell have 

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:49.490
 hear screams and see if I am 

00:01:47.710 --> 00:01:50.990
 equipment or body parts 

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:52.850
 out of the snow lake 

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:55.070
 Of course I have to go and 

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:56.869
 look if the spilled eventually 

00:01:55.070 --> 00:01:59.270
 the student ski pole directly still there 

00:01:56.869 --> 00:02:01.969
 Should hang two or more people 

00:01:59.270 --> 00:02:05.600
 looking for when I called the so-called parallel 

00:02:01.969 --> 00:02:08.000
 technicians here, too, is the distance 

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:11.060
 of 20 meters between the saviors and 

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:12.890
 ten meters to the avalanche edge 

00:02:11.060 --> 00:02:14.780
 the club seeking starts where you have a 

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:16.340
 signal has a clue of 

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:17.690
 Just follow the instructions of the 

00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:19.310
 device he should not be surprised 

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:21.230
 that one arched the 

00:02:19.310 --> 00:02:22.790
 spilled approaching is quite rare 

00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:29.090
 that you really straightforward on it 

00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:30.260
 approaches try from about five meters can 

00:02:29.090 --> 00:02:32.870
 I move quickly 

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:35.390
 after that I have to work slowly and 

00:02:32.870 --> 00:02:38.030
 The device will be handled very carefully 

00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:39.470
 not guided over the snow surface 

00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:40.760
 more moved and no longer out of the 

00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:43.430
 antenna direction broken 

00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:45.970
 the first axle parks me with one 

00:02:43.430 --> 00:02:48.650
 Skistock I'm looking for the smallest 

00:02:45.970 --> 00:02:50.239
 will spill over this value go 

00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:51.769
 I'm about a meter beyond 

00:02:50.239 --> 00:02:54.140
 to make sure I really 

00:02:51.769 --> 00:02:57.069
 even the smallest one will have achieved 

00:02:54.140 --> 00:02:59.870
 then I'll go back to the smallest 

00:02:57.069 --> 00:03:02.090
 right and left out and 

00:02:59.870 --> 00:03:04.099
 determine the suspected lying point 

00:03:02.090 --> 00:03:06.640
 I then mark these points with 

00:03:04.099 --> 00:03:06.640
 a shovel 

00:03:07.670 --> 00:03:12.180
 on average it takes about 20 minutes 

00:03:10.620 --> 00:03:14.310
 until the mountain rescue on the lavigne 

00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:16.170
 it can be a meeting in ski resorts 

00:03:14.310 --> 00:03:18.150
 go much faster already in the 

00:03:16.170 --> 00:03:20.010
 Approach becomes from the helicopter one 

00:03:18.150 --> 00:03:22.290
 lvs search performed and also one 

00:03:20.010 --> 00:03:24.599
 usually looking for when you get a signal 

00:03:22.290 --> 00:03:26.610
 a buoy is dropped and on the ground 

00:03:24.599 --> 00:03:28.650
 pinpoint location 

00:03:26.610 --> 00:03:30.540
 for reasons of time one should never 

00:03:28.650 --> 00:03:33.269
 wait for the organized rescue 

00:03:30.540 --> 00:03:34.079
 but always immediately with the mates 

00:03:33.269 --> 00:03:36.540
 to begin rescue 

00:03:34.079 --> 00:03:38.700
 No emergency equipment in the world offers 

00:03:36.540 --> 00:03:40.829
 100 percent safety only you alone 

00:03:38.700 --> 00:03:44.120
 can with your personal behavior 

00:03:40.829 --> 00:03:44.120
 reduce a risk
