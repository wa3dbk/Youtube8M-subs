00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.520
 and everyone I hope you 

00:00:01.260 --> 00:00:03.689
 go all very well today I 

00:00:02.520 --> 00:00:05.730
 come back with a video that will be a 

00:00:03.689 --> 00:00:06.750
 minimum is asked on facebook 

00:00:05.730 --> 00:00:08.189
 what video do you want to see this 

00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:10.740
 week and the majority I had 

00:00:08.189 --> 00:00:11.940
 responded to mineola I have not much to 

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:12.900
 to show you I have a little bit of 

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:14.730
 clothes a little bit of makeup 

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:16.710
 so I decided to gather the two 

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:18.060
 in a video to be able to show you 

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:20.789
 all this I'll start with the 

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:22.380
 makeup so first of all I got 

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:24.630
 bought the perfect match foundation 

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:26.580
 from l'oréal who were on specials 

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:29.099
 leclerc then I do not know does video on 

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:30.990
 the botelho clear promos because we have 

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:32.250
 had so much and then it was at each 

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:33.570
 times the same products we buy all 

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:35.190
 Shower gels of both big ones etc 

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:37.140
 I did not find very interesting about you 

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:38.550
 do it so I bought it anyway 

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:40.469
 some little makeup that I'm going 

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:41.790
 show you my but that's all so 

00:00:40.469 --> 00:00:43.890
 sir price so this foundation that 

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:45.390
 was a little worried the perfect deal 

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:46.829
 I never tried I heard 

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:47.070
 a lot a lot of good these last 

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:48.780
 time 

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:51.120
 so here I am told that I was going 

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:52.860
 to test it is the achievement of the four 

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:55.050
 natural golden I think I should have 

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:58.109
 maybe take a shade below 

00:00:55.050 --> 00:01:00.120
 land a half hue darker 

00:00:58.109 --> 00:01:01.980
 than me but I think a day at 

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:03.870
 sun and it will do it but I 

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:05.700
 have brought no problem it covers 

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:06.960
 well and race that also needs 

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:08.490
 did not want the buttons either but 

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:10.710
 but frankly it's really not bad 

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:12.060
 it hides the redness and so on and 

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:13.110
 especially there is no button so that 

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:14.400
 it's still pretty cool so 

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:16.110
 frankly I like them a lot and for 

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:17.820
 the real price is on sale at 7 euros 

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:19.049
 56 seems to me 

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:20.700
 instead of a dozen euros to little 

00:01:19.049 --> 00:01:21.900
 close so it was really worth it and 

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:23.280
 frankly if you're looking for a background of 

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:25.290
 complexion of large surfaces near not very 

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:26.610
 very dear the winners are really 

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:28.500
 well and this one I like them a lot 

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:30.000
 my mom gave me a mascara during 

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:32.460
 the botello clear promos it's the miss 

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:33.810
 manga from l'oréal was not there 

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:34.860
 a lot of opinions on it I was seeing a 

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:36.630
 little bit on youtube etc 

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:38.670
 I did not think much 

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:39.780
 on it but in the end I still 

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:41.159
 found a blogger who said that he 

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:42.630
 was really not bad and I did it at 

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:44.610
 about a week ago that I that I 

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:45.780
 the open ai and that I test it amount 

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:47.939
 mascaras I do not need to test it 

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:49.200
 for a week and the first time 

00:01:47.939 --> 00:01:50.280
 in general I know it's a tale come 

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:50.700
 or not and frankly he is really 

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:52.470
 not bad 

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:53.340
 besides there listen not very expensive but to 

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:54.509
 the base it seems to me that it's a 

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:56.520
 mascara that cost less than 10 euros 

00:01:54.509 --> 00:01:57.810
 so frankly for the price I find 

00:01:56.520 --> 00:01:59.640
 that it is still not bad that then 

00:01:57.810 --> 00:02:01.590
 I know I am offered me I 

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:02.820
 am offered for everything I have is 

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:04.530
 loudly I offered myself two products 

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:05.729
 with the -20% so first of all I 

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:07.350
 am taking the terracotta scent of 

00:02:05.729 --> 00:02:08.690
 guerlain they come out it seems to me 

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:10.160
 for 30 years 

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:11.870
 to celebrate the 30th anniversary of the hen 

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:13.670
 terracotta is not stupid 

00:02:11.870 --> 00:02:15.140
 for those who might think he 

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:16.580
 feel monoi me personally I find 

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:18.230
 that he does not really feel that it smells like 

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:21.170
 closure and coconut milk and so on 

00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:23.630
 but center still pretty hot 

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:25.280
 it smells like coconut milk with vanilla and 

00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:27.380
 everything but I do not know if I could 

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:28.580
 wear in full summer period in 

00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:29.600
 full month of August when it's super 

00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:31.400
 hot because the smell is still 

00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:33.770
 already hot enough but has for example 

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:35.420
 for the season it's really perfect 

00:02:33.770 --> 00:02:36.950
 and then, after that, it smells so good 

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:39.050
 smells hot sand and all these 

00:02:36.950 --> 00:02:40.430
 odors a little like that even if we go 

00:02:39.050 --> 00:02:42.830
 to say that hot sand does not really 

00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:44.630
 smell it really feels like the holidays 

00:02:42.830 --> 00:02:45.830
 what there are some who do not have 

00:02:44.630 --> 00:02:47.270
 loved the smell me personally i the 

00:02:45.830 --> 00:02:49.430
 bought without light you felt so 

00:02:47.270 --> 00:02:50.810
 that's when I saw the notes on the 

00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:51.890
 site sephora I told myself he 

00:02:50.810 --> 00:02:53.870
 we needed to have to 

00:02:51.890 --> 00:02:55.490
 buy it and frankly I did well 

00:02:53.870 --> 00:02:55.910
 because I'm the kind of guy that 

00:02:55.490 --> 00:02:57.830
 I just love it 

00:02:55.910 --> 00:02:59.240
 I have already used quite a lot 

00:02:57.830 --> 00:03:01.010
 then the bottle I'd like you want it 

00:02:59.240 --> 00:03:03.500
 the packaging of three years super pretty 

00:03:01.010 --> 00:03:05.720
 so here I am taking a powder 

00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:07.160
 from dior in general I'm heading 

00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:08.660
 always terracotta valley from 

00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:11.780
 guerlain I never tested the powders 

00:03:08.660 --> 00:03:14.150
 from dior and there I took one 

00:03:11.780 --> 00:03:15.200
 so that's a novelty I think 

00:03:14.150 --> 00:03:17.090
 that she is still available on 

00:03:15.200 --> 00:03:18.980
 sephora and she is really beautiful 

00:03:17.090 --> 00:03:19.940
 alley not at all tidy to warm 

00:03:18.980 --> 00:03:21.830
 the complexion I think it's really 

00:03:19.940 --> 00:03:22.160
 perfect I find it really great 

00:03:21.830 --> 00:03:23.810
 rebel 

00:03:22.160 --> 00:03:25.040
 she has little elysées inside 

00:03:23.810 --> 00:03:26.510
 but when we called him on the faces 

00:03:25.040 --> 00:03:28.489
 we do not see them that makes a rendering 

00:03:26.510 --> 00:03:29.480
 really very bright and frankly 

00:03:28.489 --> 00:03:31.520
 the gorgeous I really wanted 

00:03:29.480 --> 00:03:33.170
 to test a powder from dior and 

00:03:31.520 --> 00:03:35.150
 then I came back very happy and 

00:03:33.170 --> 00:03:37.430
 there with the -20% it was still worth 

00:03:35.150 --> 00:03:38.750
 the shot so really darling too who 

00:03:37.430 --> 00:03:41.209
 had made an order on sephora 

00:03:38.750 --> 00:03:44.269
 who took me the flamingo lipstick 

00:03:41.209 --> 00:03:46.220
 from the collection of yves aka llosa de 

00:03:44.269 --> 00:03:47.570
 at sephora so I wanted to show 

00:03:46.220 --> 00:03:49.130
 in my favorites anyway so 

00:03:47.570 --> 00:03:51.920
 you've seen my video it's a color 

00:03:49.130 --> 00:03:53.780
 hyper summer really beautiful very 

00:03:51.920 --> 00:03:54.890
 very beautiful here is the color speaks 

00:03:53.780 --> 00:03:56.510
 of itself I think that when we are 

00:03:54.890 --> 00:03:58.820
 tanned it must really beautiful 

00:03:56.510 --> 00:03:59.840
 ga tanned already just for that because 

00:03:58.820 --> 00:04:01.070
 that when we put lipsticks 

00:03:59.840 --> 00:04:04.310
 like that on a matte skin 

00:04:01.070 --> 00:04:05.989
 it's just perfect for summer and 

00:04:04.310 --> 00:04:07.430
 anyway they are great they are good 

00:04:05.989 --> 00:04:08.360
 creamy and very very pigmented so 

00:04:07.430 --> 00:04:11.209
 I am very happy 

00:04:08.360 --> 00:04:13.040
 he had ordered the men ted fuchsia 

00:04:11.209 --> 00:04:14.319
 from both home to fight yes I 

00:04:13.040 --> 00:04:16.579
 do not know I was going to say anything 

00:04:14.319 --> 00:04:17.780
 so mail as fuchsia at all 

00:04:16.579 --> 00:04:19.010
 to do it frankly it's a color 

00:04:17.780 --> 00:04:20.090
 beautiful I did you a review on 

00:04:19.010 --> 00:04:22.010
 the product so I'm not going to you in 

00:04:20.090 --> 00:04:23.120
 speak for a thousand years I will put you 

00:04:22.010 --> 00:04:24.740
 the link in info bar is a 

00:04:23.120 --> 00:04:26.389
 product that is great and that I love 

00:04:24.740 --> 00:04:27.020
 so I was really very excited about 

00:04:26.389 --> 00:04:28.490
 view 

00:04:27.020 --> 00:04:29.630
 and that's all for the beauty part 

00:04:28.490 --> 00:04:30.800
 cosmetic so I want to go to 

00:04:29.630 --> 00:04:32.990
 clothes I do not have much to you 

00:04:30.800 --> 00:04:35.419
 to show no more at h &amp; m first 

00:04:32.990 --> 00:04:36.650
 I took this little top there 

00:04:35.419 --> 00:04:38.330
 looks a little bit like the top of the 

00:04:36.650 --> 00:04:39.560
 miranda kerr collection at you know 

00:04:38.330 --> 00:04:40.190
 with the ruffles coming down and a 

00:04:39.560 --> 00:04:42.410
 a little bit lower 

00:04:40.190 --> 00:04:44.210
 so here it is a top in the same 

00:04:42.410 --> 00:04:45.500
 style it is not transparent so that 

00:04:44.210 --> 00:04:48.200
 it's pretty cool and then we never 

00:04:45.500 --> 00:04:49.280
 enough white top and that's with the 

00:04:48.200 --> 00:04:51.470
 thin straps etc 

00:04:49.280 --> 00:04:53.660
 he is really cute and for the price 

00:04:51.470 --> 00:04:55.340
 listen they will not do 95 so that's 

00:04:53.660 --> 00:04:57.050
 really not much I also 

00:04:55.340 --> 00:04:58.850
 bought the black I wear on me 

00:04:57.050 --> 00:05:01.190
 currently so they are really 

00:04:58.850 --> 00:05:03.710
 all cute and not very expensive side so 

00:05:01.190 --> 00:05:05.830
 So here at h &amp; m I took a top 

00:05:03.710 --> 00:05:07.910
 really simple basic white 

00:05:05.830 --> 00:05:10.160
 since everything but basic white was 

00:05:07.910 --> 00:05:12.320
 more very white just whose you there 

00:05:10.160 --> 00:05:14.000
 find that one 7 euros 95 it is not 

00:05:12.320 --> 00:05:15.350
 too short not too long it wets well 

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:17.390
 she really is he really is 

00:05:15.350 --> 00:05:17.960
 perfect so that's after my shopping 

00:05:17.390 --> 00:05:19.940
 at zara 

00:05:17.960 --> 00:05:21.850
 I bought myself so that makes it a 

00:05:19.940 --> 00:05:23.780
 little moment it's been at least two months 

00:05:21.850 --> 00:05:25.700
 that I will buy but I had you 

00:05:23.780 --> 00:05:27.680
 not show it's the zara la blouse 

00:05:25.700 --> 00:05:30.350
 famous dahra blouse we heard 

00:05:27.680 --> 00:05:32.750
 talk about everywhere right now finally 

00:05:30.350 --> 00:05:33.919
 lately that personally 

00:05:32.750 --> 00:05:35.419
 I find really beautiful I 

00:05:33.919 --> 00:05:37.060
 finds very very pretty wore she does 

00:05:35.419 --> 00:05:38.690
 very classy very classy etc 

00:05:37.060 --> 00:05:39.919
 personally I do not find it too 

00:05:38.690 --> 00:05:42.470
 short I really like the facts that 

00:05:39.919 --> 00:05:44.180
 that it does not need 

00:05:42.470 --> 00:05:45.620
 have a big chest for the m I 

00:05:44.180 --> 00:05:46.520
 think that's why 

00:05:45.620 --> 00:05:48.590
 many did not buy 

00:05:46.520 --> 00:05:49.880
 I take them in size m since 

00:05:48.590 --> 00:05:50.450
 I saw that everyone preached it a 

00:05:49.880 --> 00:05:53.150
 size above 

00:05:50.450 --> 00:05:54.830
 so I present them ayem and I think 

00:05:53.150 --> 00:05:57.260
 that size would have been more than enough 

00:05:54.830 --> 00:05:58.669
 but hey it still suits me well 

00:05:57.260 --> 00:06:01.820
 serves well at the shoulders and it's 

00:05:58.669 --> 00:06:03.050
 my case no problem but here it is 

00:06:01.820 --> 00:06:05.180
 is still available anyway 

00:06:03.050 --> 00:06:08.120
 then I found myself a little top 

00:06:05.180 --> 00:06:10.070
 that I had spotted on repeated that 

00:06:08.120 --> 00:06:12.350
 I had spotted on a German on 

00:06:10.070 --> 00:06:15.350
 instagram that I found manifest 

00:06:12.350 --> 00:06:17.150
 ic and on the sahara point fr he was 

00:06:15.350 --> 00:06:18.200
 not so I was really disgusted and 

00:06:17.150 --> 00:06:20.240
 a few days later I went 

00:06:18.200 --> 00:06:21.470
 at zara and I found them directly 

00:06:20.240 --> 00:06:23.660
 at the entrance so I was really too 

00:06:21.470 --> 00:06:25.400
 so that's the one I'm giving you 

00:06:23.660 --> 00:06:27.320
 have posted anyway on integrity but 

00:06:25.400 --> 00:06:28.850
 on facebook it seems to me it's a top 

00:06:27.320 --> 00:06:31.130
 that I showed you in my last 

00:06:28.850 --> 00:06:34.670
 to the mode in beige and not out 

00:06:31.130 --> 00:06:36.260
 so in red coral pretty bright that I 

00:06:34.670 --> 00:06:36.710
 find beautiful I already adored in 

00:06:36.260 --> 00:06:39.080
 beige 

00:06:36.710 --> 00:06:40.610
 there are also white and gold there I 

00:06:39.080 --> 00:06:43.160
 finds that this offers really makes 

00:06:40.610 --> 00:06:44.930
 very very classy very chic and that with a 

00:06:43.160 --> 00:06:48.110
 black pants etc 

00:06:44.930 --> 00:06:49.790
 he is really beautiful I am 

00:06:48.110 --> 00:06:51.530
 fall it is really beautiful and I do not know 

00:06:49.790 --> 00:06:53.300
 if they put now on the sahara 

00:06:51.530 --> 00:06:55.250
 point fr I do not believe but in any case 

00:06:53.300 --> 00:06:57.290
 case they are available in shop 

00:06:55.250 --> 00:06:58.700
 I was already not much when I 

00:06:57.290 --> 00:07:00.380
 arrived it was at the front entrance 

00:06:58.700 --> 00:07:01.490
 stay three or four so I got 

00:07:00.380 --> 00:07:03.140
 thrown on happily there was 

00:07:01.490 --> 00:07:04.610
 still size because I believe that 

00:07:03.140 --> 00:07:06.890
 otherwise I would have been disgusted but now 

00:07:04.610 --> 00:07:09.380
 they listen to 29 euros trains 15 the 

00:07:06.890 --> 00:07:10.790
 price in size s and it's perfect so 

00:07:09.380 --> 00:07:14.000
 I'm really happy with it and 

00:07:10.790 --> 00:07:15.740
 to finish i got hold i got 

00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:16.820
 taken I caught myself I say no matter 

00:07:15.740 --> 00:07:18.530
 what is it in this 

00:07:16.820 --> 00:07:20.000
 video so small flat sandals 

00:07:18.530 --> 00:07:22.160
 or flip flops I do not know how you 

00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:24.920
 call it the same I had spotted it on 

00:07:22.160 --> 00:07:26.060
 the site in fuchsia and white but 

00:07:24.920 --> 00:07:27.740
 I wanted them at all costs from this 

00:07:26.060 --> 00:07:29.330
 color I took them a size at 

00:07:27.740 --> 00:07:31.310
 above my usual size and then 

00:07:29.330 --> 00:07:32.840
 I really like the retro color 

00:07:31.310 --> 00:07:35.300
 really super pretty I really liked 

00:07:32.840 --> 00:07:37.400
 it's very summery and traveling finds 

00:07:35.300 --> 00:07:40.070
 perfect for this summer so here and 

00:07:37.400 --> 00:07:42.500
 they cost me 19 euros 95 so 

00:07:40.070 --> 00:07:44.120
 rather reasonable I find for 

00:07:42.500 --> 00:07:45.680
 chance here are the movies in small hall is 

00:07:44.120 --> 00:07:47.510

00:07:47.510 --> 00:07:51.700
 full of kisses and I tell you see you soon
