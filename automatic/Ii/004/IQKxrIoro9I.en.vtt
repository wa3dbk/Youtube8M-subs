00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:47.880
 Heard as part part of the head that say this Knights of which Billy Joe possibly 

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:49.930
 I think that there are some people, and this work is actually composed by Beethoven 

00:00:47.880 --> 00:00:54.620
 Piano sonata eighth 

00:00:49.930 --> 00:01:00.430
 It is the head of the second movement of the delusion 

00:00:54.620 --> 00:01:00.430
 Then please listen to how the 1st movement of this work starts 

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:04.940

00:01:40.210 --> 00:01:44.880
 Do 

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:54.360
 Beethoven 

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:56.700
 It is a composer of 10 generators , but speaking of 10 generators 

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:58.440
 Well classic 

00:01:56.700 --> 00:02:03.420
 I'm such 

00:01:58.440 --> 00:02:09.860
 Beethoven himself is also there just this classic that was alive Well the late 18th century 

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:17.130
 There I it was a like a bridge from the school towards the I 19 century Romantics of the next era 

00:02:09.860 --> 00:02:21.140
 In the classical school, the rules are so strict that in the world of music and in the world of other arts 

00:02:17.130 --> 00:02:24.270
 The same is true in the world of literature, but for example music 

00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:29.410
 When writing a composition song 

00:02:24.270 --> 00:02:34.810
 There are a lot of rules such as how to arrange early to build, and so on 

00:02:29.410 --> 00:02:39.420
 Beethoven follows the rules, but more to the music for the next romantic 

00:02:34.810 --> 00:02:45.810
 I 'm going to write more emotions 

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:46.620
 This sorrow sonata is also a work full of emotions with very positive meaning as the title 

00:02:45.810 --> 00:02:51.830
 is 

00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:51.830
 Please listen by all songs somewhere by all means if you also have the opportunity
