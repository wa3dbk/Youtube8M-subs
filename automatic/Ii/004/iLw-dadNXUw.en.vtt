00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.740
 Hello dear friends Swami banner 

00:00:02.760 --> 00:00:06.779
 and now we are not in the forest 

00:00:04.740 --> 00:00:08.719
 and in a computer program which 

00:00:06.779 --> 00:00:10.889
 accuracy repeats the starry sky 

00:00:08.719 --> 00:00:12.480
 well or at least trying it 

00:00:10.889 --> 00:00:14.429
 do now i will show you how you can 

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:16.619
 navigate night time with 

00:00:14.429 --> 00:00:19.350
 using stars to determine sides 

00:00:16.619 --> 00:00:19.980
 light we are in about areas 

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:22.109
 Moscow 

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:23.970
 Here on such coordinates 

00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:26.730
 it turns out to the north pole to 

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:29.699
 navigate to determine sides 

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:31.730
 light in the northern hemisphere we need 

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:33.270
 find one star which is called 

00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:35.309
 polar star 

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:37.790
 the polar star is located right 

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:39.960
 practically over the north pole 

00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:41.489
 that is, a small error all the same 

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:45.360
 have if you don't have any 

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:47.789
 from instruments to determine sides 

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:50.250
 light such as a compass, it is quite possible 

00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:51.750
 navigate and at night by stars like 

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:54.449
 to find the polar star we need 

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:58.530
 find some stars in the sky 

00:00:54.449 --> 00:01:02.090
 constellations such as big dipper 

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:06.320
 Now we are here in the form of stars Bucket 

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:08.790
 Ursa Minor now all stars 

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:11.270
 because all the constellations that we need it 

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:15.950
 dachshund everywhere cassiopeia 

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:20.860
 And finally, here it is the constellation of Orion 

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:23.230
 now I will probably turn on the grid 

00:01:20.860 --> 00:01:25.150
 well or not constellations and the name of the constellations 

00:01:23.230 --> 00:01:28.260
 and so here's a big bear 

00:01:25.150 --> 00:01:31.690
 we need from it only this bucket 

00:01:28.260 --> 00:01:35.140
 consisting of three stars is bucket revenue 

00:01:31.690 --> 00:01:38.440
 bucket and well suppose of course and here 

00:01:35.140 --> 00:01:39.310
 such a dipper itself we take two extreme 

00:01:38.440 --> 00:01:42.760
 star bucket 

00:01:39.310 --> 00:01:43.780
 and this one is called a yardstick and 

00:01:42.760 --> 00:01:46.540
 dubha 

00:01:43.780 --> 00:01:49.780
 two stars and spend between them 

00:01:46.540 --> 00:01:52.150
 imaginary line through them more precisely 

00:01:49.780 --> 00:01:53.619
 let's go through the imaginary line now 

00:01:52.150 --> 00:01:56.590
 take this big segment and 

00:01:53.619 --> 00:02:00.369
 padded five times this side so 

00:01:56.590 --> 00:02:02.490
 we will fall on the polar star all the stars 

00:02:00.369 --> 00:02:04.840
 spinning around the polar star 

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:05.790
 Now I will show it narrowly and slightly 

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:08.580
 time 

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:11.260
 Soon you see a little bit of time. 

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:12.970
 polar star maintain its position 

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:14.250
 and all the other stars around her 

00:02:12.970 --> 00:02:16.590
 is spinning 

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:19.260
 that is, not the stars spinning naturally I 

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:24.570
 just a star is located above us 

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:28.920
 north and so i will disconnect by this point i 

00:02:24.570 --> 00:02:31.770
 I want to return the time, let's return the title 

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:33.959
 so let it be evening if muscari 

00:02:31.770 --> 00:02:36.690
 based on time q and so if you have everything 

00:02:33.959 --> 00:02:38.180
 the same big bear turned out to be 

00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:41.130
 clouds that is, it is not visible 

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:43.470
 there is a second way with cassiopeia 

00:02:41.130 --> 00:02:47.510
 the constellation Cassiopeia is located here 

00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:50.370
 here it looks like the letter w 

00:02:47.510 --> 00:02:51.840
 take these two extreme points 

00:02:50.370 --> 00:02:54.300
 draw between them 

00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:56.580
 imaginary line through them generated 

00:02:54.300 --> 00:02:58.260
 lines so take these two points 

00:02:56.580 --> 00:03:02.160
 we will also draw an imaginary through them 

00:02:58.260 --> 00:03:06.120
 line where it is us these lines intersect 

00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:09.270
 put an imaginary point in z. 

00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:13.220
 and this one is a super name and this one 

00:03:09.270 --> 00:03:16.190
 here's a star we draw a line 

00:03:13.220 --> 00:03:21.010
 and extend and and further and pineapple 

00:03:16.190 --> 00:03:24.590
 will cross the polar star 

00:03:21.010 --> 00:03:26.330
 But if all the same everywhere in Cassiopeia 

00:03:24.590 --> 00:03:30.260
 you turned out to be behind the clouds 

00:03:26.330 --> 00:03:32.870
 then you can determine where is 

00:03:30.260 --> 00:03:35.030
 polar star and using the constellation 

00:03:32.870 --> 00:03:37.280
 Orion develop using this constellation 

00:03:35.030 --> 00:03:40.550
 harder harder to detect 

00:03:37.280 --> 00:03:42.470
 where is the polar star immediately 

00:03:40.550 --> 00:03:44.060
 i'm sorry i stumble or 

00:03:42.470 --> 00:03:48.230
 bristles like this all write one 

00:03:44.060 --> 00:03:50.690
 a piece I will not cut anything so take 

00:03:48.230 --> 00:03:52.580
 in Orion's belt in general is a constellation 

00:03:50.690 --> 00:03:54.650
 located close to the equator that is 

00:03:52.580 --> 00:04:00.680
 she is and that is you can see 

00:03:54.650 --> 00:04:02.570
 and on the southern hemisphere well here help 

00:04:00.680 --> 00:04:04.910
 it can still be defined where 

00:04:02.570 --> 00:04:08.930
 is the polestar so take here 

00:04:04.910 --> 00:04:13.670
 this central star from orion belt and 

00:04:08.930 --> 00:04:17.750
 This is the top of the head 

00:04:13.670 --> 00:04:22.130
 them straight imaginary line now i'm 

00:04:17.750 --> 00:04:25.130
 probably turn on the grid so here so 

00:04:22.130 --> 00:04:30.720
 draw a line and this line will be 

00:04:25.130 --> 00:04:31.849
 extend further across the sky in a straight line 

00:04:30.720 --> 00:04:35.260
 here 

00:04:31.849 --> 00:04:37.960
 and we will get to the polar star 

00:04:35.260 --> 00:04:41.820
 This is also possible 

00:04:37.960 --> 00:04:45.130
 determine where we are north 

00:04:41.820 --> 00:04:47.350
 now Iâ€™ll go away of course 

00:04:45.130 --> 00:04:51.970
 you can also determine the direction of the world 

00:04:47.350 --> 00:04:53.620
 is if you get up and hope everything 

00:04:51.970 --> 00:04:57.550
 know it perfectly well if you get up 

00:04:53.620 --> 00:05:00.790
 facing north then you right side 

00:04:57.550 --> 00:05:05.560
 you will be east with your left west and behind 

00:05:00.790 --> 00:05:07.720
 south well and vice versa so now we 

00:05:05.560 --> 00:05:11.290
 let's go to the southern hemisphere and try 

00:05:07.720 --> 00:05:13.480
 there define the sides of the world and so we 

00:05:11.290 --> 00:05:15.790
 continue now we are somewhere 

00:05:13.480 --> 00:05:19.230
 near Madagascar, this is southern 

00:05:15.790 --> 00:05:21.610
 hemisphere among the ocean at some fee 

00:05:19.230 --> 00:05:24.790
 we need to determine where is 

00:05:21.610 --> 00:05:26.670
 south pole over the south pole no 

00:05:24.790 --> 00:05:29.800
 no steady stars which 

00:05:26.670 --> 00:05:32.530
 strictly pointed to the south that's why 

00:05:29.800 --> 00:05:34.780
 you can determine where is the south with 

00:05:32.530 --> 00:05:37.000
 using one constellation which 

00:05:34.780 --> 00:05:40.120
 called and already 

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:41.920
 southern cross well actually here she find 

00:05:40.120 --> 00:05:44.560
 it may still seem pretty 

00:05:41.920 --> 00:05:47.560
 difficult at first but if you have clear skies 

00:05:44.560 --> 00:05:49.630
 you see the milky way then find here 

00:05:47.560 --> 00:05:52.590
 such a nebula which is called 

00:05:49.630 --> 00:05:55.510
 coal bag if not mistaken here 

00:05:52.590 --> 00:05:59.320
 near this coal bag is located 

00:05:55.510 --> 00:06:01.360
 five stars here they are pretty bright 5 

00:05:59.320 --> 00:06:02.040
 stars that are southern 

00:06:01.360 --> 00:06:05.380
 cross 

00:06:02.040 --> 00:06:06.750
 oh my gosh it's all included so here 

00:06:05.380 --> 00:06:09.520
 South Cross 

00:06:06.750 --> 00:06:12.100
 there are some simple crisst but 

00:06:09.520 --> 00:06:14.050
 determine that this cross is the one that 

00:06:12.100 --> 00:06:17.220
 we need we can with the help of these 

00:06:14.050 --> 00:06:20.470
 here are two stars indicators so let's call them 

00:06:17.220 --> 00:06:23.230
 if they are they show us on 

00:06:20.470 --> 00:06:24.850
 southern cross and so using this southern 

00:06:23.230 --> 00:06:27.070
 cross can determine where is 

00:06:24.850 --> 00:06:29.830
 the south pole will do it as follows 

00:06:27.070 --> 00:06:34.330
 way we take and draw an imaginary 

00:06:29.830 --> 00:06:35.010
 line through these two stars like that 

00:06:34.330 --> 00:06:37.180
 way 

00:06:35.010 --> 00:06:38.249
 hold in now take this one 

00:06:37.180 --> 00:06:41.189
 section 

00:06:38.249 --> 00:06:42.599
 and pave it this way four with 

00:06:41.189 --> 00:06:52.949
 half times that is , take about 

00:06:42.599 --> 00:06:56.189
 Now two or three 4 5 somewhere here often 

00:06:52.949 --> 00:06:57.089
 see decrease less here somewhere here i'm 

00:06:56.189 --> 00:07:00.919
 forgot to turn on 

00:06:57.089 --> 00:07:08.129
 side of the world here's south then see 

00:07:00.919 --> 00:07:10.799
 take the padded 4 1 1 1 1 2 3 4 

00:07:08.129 --> 00:07:14.149
 there is a half and he will spend 

00:07:10.799 --> 00:07:16.649
 perpendicular to the horizontal that is and 

00:07:14.149 --> 00:07:19.289
 get south direction 

00:07:16.649 --> 00:07:20.909
 that is, you find yourself at sea in the south 

00:07:19.289 --> 00:07:22.549
 hemisphere please can you 

00:07:20.909 --> 00:07:26.189
 determine where you are south with 

00:07:22.549 --> 00:07:27.989
 using stars I hope you never 

00:07:26.189 --> 00:07:30.389
 come in handy but still if you hit 

00:07:27.989 --> 00:07:32.099
 extreme situation you can quite 

00:07:30.389 --> 00:07:35.909
 navigate through the stars with 

00:07:32.099 --> 00:07:37.409
 of these methods here and if you are on 

00:07:35.909 --> 00:07:40.109
 some kind of hard surface for example 

00:07:37.409 --> 00:07:41.669
 are then recommend you when you 

00:07:40.109 --> 00:07:43.799
 watched the night sky 

00:07:41.669 --> 00:07:46.499
 determine where the sides of the world stick 

00:07:43.799 --> 00:07:48.659
 yourself a stick in this direction on not yourself 

00:07:46.499 --> 00:07:50.909
 stick into the ground in roll away and stick and you 

00:07:48.659 --> 00:07:52.649
 will be able to determine in the morning get up and 

00:07:50.909 --> 00:07:55.589
 you can determine where the north is and 

00:07:52.649 --> 00:07:57.539
 south there housework so thank you all with you 

00:07:55.589 --> 00:08:01.369
