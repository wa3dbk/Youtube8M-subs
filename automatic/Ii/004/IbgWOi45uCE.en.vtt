00:01:29.179 --> 00:01:29.189 
one here is just for damage it will

00:01:29.189 --> 00:01:30.859 
one here is just for damage it will
probably<00:01:29.430> do<00:01:29.700> the<00:01:29.880> most<00:01:30.119> damage<00:01:30.390> and<00:01:30.780> is

really<00:01:31.200> easy<00:01:31.350> to<00:01:31.619> pull<00:01:31.770> off<00:01:31.799> so<00:01:32.220> you<00:01:32.280> go<00:01:32.520> as

00:01:32.719 --> 00:01:32.729

00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:19.350 
it's how amazing the worid is at that

00:02:19.350 --> 00:02:21.980 
it's how amazing the worid is at that
and<00:02:19.560> how<00:02:19.890> to<00:02:20.400> use<00:02:20.550> mix-ups<00:02:21.090> okay<00:02:21.600> so<00:02:21.660> as<00:02:21.840> you

and how to use mix-ups okay so as you

00:02:21.990 --> 00:02:24.230 
and how to use mix-ups okay so as you
see<00:02:22.140> there<00:02:22.380> I<00:02:22.590> hit<00:02:22.770> a<00:02:22.830> low<00:02:23.130> and<00:02:23.460> then<00:02:23.940> a<00:02:23.970> bug

00:02:24.230 --> 00:02:24.240 
see there I hit a low and then a bug

00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:26.450 
see there I hit a low and then a bug
spray<00:02:24.510> if<00:02:24.810> someone<00:02:25.410> is<00:02:25.530> blocking<00:02:25.710> up<00:02:26.070> that's

00:02:26.450 --> 00:02:26.460 
spray if someone is blocking up that's

00:02:26.460 --> 00:02:27.890 
spray if someone is blocking up that's
what<00:02:26.640> you<00:02:26.730> should<00:02:26.910> do<00:02:27.090> because<00:02:27.270> if<00:02:27.690> they're

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:27.900 
what you should do because if they're

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:29.510 
what you should do because if they're
blocking<00:02:28.140> up<00:02:28.440> and<00:02:28.710> you're<00:02:29.070> hitting<00:02:29.280> a<00:02:29.340> low

00:02:29.510 --> 00:02:29.520 
blocking up and you're hitting a low

00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:32.120 
blocking up and you're hitting a low
their<00:02:30.300> block<00:02:30.570> is<00:02:30.810> ineffective<00:02:31.500> and<00:02:31.740> it's<00:02:31.920> free

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:32.130 
their block is ineffective and it's free

00:02:32.130 --> 00:02:33.680 
their block is ineffective and it's free
after<00:02:32.370> that<00:02:32.520> I<00:02:32.550> use<00:02:32.760> the<00:02:32.880> bug<00:02:33.090> spray<00:02:33.210> to<00:02:33.420> keep

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:33.690 
after that I use the bug spray to keep

00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:35.510 
after that I use the bug spray to keep
up<00:02:33.870> the<00:02:33.990> pressure<00:02:34.170> and<00:02:34.620> there's<00:02:34.980> free<00:02:35.220> after

00:02:35.510 --> 00:02:35.520 
up the pressure and there's free after

00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:37.790 
up the pressure and there's free after
that<00:02:35.700> I<00:02:35.940> did<00:02:36.150> the<00:02:36.270> forward<00:02:36.720> -<00:02:37.080> -<00:02:37.380> which<00:02:37.590> is<00:02:37.710> the

00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:37.800 
that I did the forward - - which is the

00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:39.680 
that I did the forward - - which is the
overhead<00:02:38.310> now<00:02:38.670> you<00:02:38.730> might<00:02:39.060> see<00:02:39.300> what's<00:02:39.480> going

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:39.690 
overhead now you might see what's going

00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:41.390 
overhead now you might see what's going
on<00:02:39.810> here<00:02:40.020> first<00:02:40.410> I'll<00:02:40.680> start<00:02:40.740> off<00:02:41.010> the<00:02:41.160> low

00:02:41.390 --> 00:02:41.400 
on here first I'll start off the low

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:43.910 
on here first I'll start off the low
then<00:02:42.060> the<00:02:42.180> medium<00:02:42.540> with<00:02:42.660> the<00:02:42.750> bug<00:02:42.990> spray<00:02:43.140> then

00:02:43.910 --> 00:02:43.920 
then the medium with the bug spray then

00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:45.650 
then the medium with the bug spray then
I<00:02:43.950> followed<00:02:44.340> the<00:02:44.430> upwind<00:02:44.700> an<00:02:44.880> overhead<00:02:45.390> and

00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:45.660 
I followed the upwind an overhead and

00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:47.000 
I followed the upwind an overhead and
then<00:02:45.930> after<00:02:46.170> that<00:02:46.260> I<00:02:46.320> can<00:02:46.470> keep<00:02:46.620> the<00:02:46.680> pressure

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:47.010 
then after that I can keep the pressure

00:02:47.010 --> 00:02:49.460 
then after that I can keep the pressure
going<00:02:47.340> mix<00:02:47.850> it<00:02:47.970> up<00:02:48.090> a<00:02:48.210> bit<00:02:48.240> maybe<00:02:49.050> go<00:02:49.290> for

00:02:49.460 --> 00:02:49.470 
going mix it up a bit maybe go for

00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:52.580 
going mix it up a bit maybe go for
overhead<00:02:49.980> again<00:02:50.160> then<00:02:51.120> for<00:02:51.330> a<00:02:51.360> low<00:02:51.630> and<00:02:52.020> the

00:02:52.580 --> 00:02:52.590 
overhead again then for a low and the

00:02:52.590 --> 00:02:54.080 
overhead again then for a low and the
bug<00:02:52.740> spray<00:02:52.860> is<00:02:53.100> always<00:02:53.310> gonna<00:02:53.460> be<00:02:53.550> the<00:02:53.760> medium

00:02:54.080 --> 00:02:54.090 
bug spray is always gonna be the medium

00:02:54.090 --> 00:02:55.940 
bug spray is always gonna be the medium
the<00:02:54.390> bug<00:02:54.540> spray<00:02:54.660> will<00:02:54.900> always<00:02:55.170> be<00:02:55.350> there<00:02:55.560> to

00:02:55.940 --> 00:02:55.950 
the bug spray will always be there to

00:02:55.950 --> 00:02:58.220 
the bug spray will always be there to
piss<00:02:56.130> them<00:02:56.280> off<00:02:56.430> you<00:02:57.390> can<00:02:57.450> hold<00:02:57.750> the<00:02:57.900> bug<00:02:58.080> spray

00:02:58.220 --> 00:02:58.230 
piss them off you can hold the bug spray

heads<00:03:57.540> another<00:03:57.810> variation<00:03:58.110> which<00:03:58.440> is<00:03:58.560> exactly

00:03:59.150 --> 00:03:59.160 
heads another variation which is exactly

00:03:59.160 --> 00:04:01.070 
heads another variation which is exactly
the<00:03:59.370> same<00:03:59.580> that<00:03:59.850> starts<00:04:00.180> off<00:04:00.300> with<00:04:00.450> four<00:04:00.780> four

00:04:01.070 --> 00:04:01.080 
the same that starts off with four four

00:04:01.080 --> 00:04:03.470 
the same that starts off with four four
four<00:04:01.290> is<00:04:01.320> ten<00:04:01.650> so<00:04:02.250> it's<00:04:02.430> four<00:04:02.640> four<00:04:02.910> four<00:04:03.180> first

00:04:03.470 --> 00:04:03.480 
four is ten so it's four four four first

00:04:03.480 --> 00:04:06.380 
four is ten so it's four four four first
then<00:04:04.380> forward<00:04:04.770> three<00:04:04.980> four<00:04:05.250> then<00:04:05.970> the<00:04:06.000> grab

00:04:06.380 --> 00:04:06.390 
then forward three four then the grab

00:04:06.390 --> 00:04:08.870 
then forward three four then the grab
one<00:04:06.960> plus<00:04:07.230> free<00:04:07.500> or<00:04:07.710> lb<00:04:08.070> depending<00:04:08.550> on<00:04:08.670> what

one plus free or lb depending on what

00:04:08.880 --> 00:04:10.850 
one plus free or lb depending on what
you're<00:04:09.030> using<00:04:09.270> which<00:04:09.810> does<00:04:10.020> more<00:04:10.350> damage<00:04:10.380> in

00:04:10.850 --> 00:04:10.860 
you're using which does more damage in

00:04:10.860 --> 00:04:13.070 
you're using which does more damage in
the<00:04:10.950> first<00:04:11.220> variation<00:04:11.610> but<00:04:12.420> you've<00:04:12.660> got<00:04:12.930> to

00:04:13.070 --> 00:04:13.080 
the first variation but you've got to

00:04:13.080 --> 00:04:15.710 
the first variation but you've got to
remember<00:04:13.290> the<00:04:13.980> two<00:04:14.280> one<00:04:14.520> two<00:04:14.730> is<00:04:14.940> a<00:04:14.970> lot<00:04:15.300> faster

00:04:15.710 --> 00:04:15.720 
remember the two one two is a lot faster

00:04:15.720 --> 00:04:17.180 
remember the two one two is a lot faster
and<00:04:15.780> a<00:04:15.870> lot<00:04:16.049> easier<00:04:16.350> to<00:04:16.500> hit<00:04:16.650> than<00:04:16.859> the<00:04:16.980> four

00:04:17.180 --> 00:04:17.190 
and a lot easier to hit than the four

00:04:17.190 --> 00:04:19.520 
and a lot easier to hit than the four
for<00:04:17.460> the<00:04:17.880> four<00:04:18.150> four<00:04:18.480> is<00:04:18.510> a<00:04:18.690> bit<00:04:19.109> harder<00:04:19.500> to

00:04:19.520 --> 00:04:19.530 
for the four four is a bit harder to

00:04:19.530 --> 00:04:21.349 
for the four four is a bit harder to
pull<00:04:19.830> off<00:04:19.950> because<00:04:20.100> it<00:04:20.370> is<00:04:20.549> slower<00:04:20.850> but<00:04:21.299> more

00:04:21.349 --> 00:04:21.359 
pull off because it is slower but more

00:04:21.359 --> 00:04:23.570 
pull off because it is slower but more
rewarding<00:04:22.049> just<00:04:22.470> bear<00:04:22.740> that<00:04:22.770> in<00:04:22.950> mind<00:04:23.010> also

00:04:23.570 --> 00:04:23.580 
rewarding just bear that in mind also

rewarding just bear that in mind also
bear<00:04:24.060> in<00:04:24.090> mind<00:04:24.240> that<00:04:24.480> both<00:04:24.750> of<00:04:24.780> these<00:04:24.990> combos

00:04:25.310 --> 00:04:25.320 
bear in mind that both of these combos

00:04:25.320 --> 00:04:27.440 
bear in mind that both of these combos
can<00:04:25.650> be<00:04:25.830> ended<00:04:26.160> with<00:04:26.310> the<00:04:26.460> down<00:04:26.730> two<00:04:27.060> instead

00:04:27.440 --> 00:04:27.450 
can be ended with the down two instead

00:04:27.450 --> 00:04:29.270 
can be ended with the down two instead
of<00:04:27.600> the<00:04:27.720> grab<00:04:27.960> which<00:04:28.290> actually<00:04:28.590> does<00:04:28.800> do<00:04:29.010> more

00:04:29.270 --> 00:04:29.280 
of the grab which actually does do more

00:04:29.280 --> 00:04:30.420 
of the grab which actually does do more
damage<00:04:29.460> and<00:04:29.820> you<00:04:29.940> can't

00:04:30.420 --> 00:04:30.430 
damage and you can't

00:04:30.430 --> 00:04:32.700 
damage and you can't
the<00:04:30.790> combo<00:04:31.180> he<00:04:31.570> could<00:04:31.720> also<00:04:31.840> just<00:04:32.200> do<00:04:32.350> the<00:04:32.470> four

00:04:32.700 --> 00:04:32.710 
the combo he could also just do the four

0.9 you would be expecting it goes up to
1.3<00:05:23.980> 4<00:05:24.610> which<00:05:24.820> is<00:05:24.970> over<00:05:25.420> 0.4%<00:05:26.260> and<00:05:26.890> the<00:05:27.160> great

00:05:27.360 --> 00:05:27.370 
1.3 4 which is over 0.4% and the great

00:05:27.370 --> 00:05:29.160 
1.3 4 which is over 0.4% and the great
thing<00:05:27.610> about<00:05:27.700> the<00:05:27.970> poison<00:05:28.390> damage<00:05:28.510> is<00:05:28.810> that<00:05:29.050> it

00:05:29.160 --> 00:05:29.170 
thing about the poison damage is that it

00:05:29.170 --> 00:05:31.290 
thing about the poison damage is that it
hits<00:05:29.380> five<00:05:29.860> times<00:05:30.280> so<00:05:30.520> be<00:05:30.700> one<00:05:30.910> point<00:05:31.150> three

00:05:33.210 --> 00:05:33.220 
four times by five another thing I

00:05:33.220 --> 00:05:35.010 
four times by five another thing I
