00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.230
 Hello you and welcome 

00:00:02.070 --> 00:00:06.990
 to play a new video of the 

00:00:04.230 --> 00:00:10.429
 children's toys I have for you today 

00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:13.049
 the course remained if maker of chi course 

00:00:10.429 --> 00:00:14.219
 suitable for children over three years and 

00:00:13.049 --> 00:00:15.389
 I also had dinner with him 

00:00:14.219 --> 00:00:17.160
 manufacturer wondered 

00:00:15.389 --> 00:00:19.859
 Actually we thought we were going to be a play 

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:22.439
 ordered by toys but that 

00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:25.410
 seems to be imitating something like that now 

00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:26.939
 be a plagiarism may if you look 

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:28.470
 namely the packaging looks from 

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:30.210
 a real play with toys 

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:32.219
 then you notice that even the 

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:35.670
 packaging is pretty similar and also 

00:00:32.219 --> 00:00:37.230
 maybe after made so there we are 

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:41.100
 maybe a dodger at 

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:41.489
 Amazon finally thought 

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:44.460
 we 

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:48.809
 so what another great toy 

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:49.950
 which rollsis and ice lollies 

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:53.940
 can prepare 

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:56.250
 I'm kneading with five doses of gags 

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:58.050
 I almost said doh play and I would 

00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:59.520
 say we just look at it all 

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:00.600
 take a closer look and maybe I'll do it 

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:03.390
 also a small comparison 

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:08.430
 between a player set and the g 

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:11.479
 Crystal remained ob maker first look 

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:11.479
 we are all there 

00:01:16.220 --> 00:01:30.410
 here a background for the games and 

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:33.860
 a few more then the 

00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:35.630
 knead that orange now pretty much 

00:01:33.860 --> 00:01:38.330
 simple packed so not extra now 

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:40.750
 still somehow the brand name on it 

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:40.750
 printed 

00:01:44.170 --> 00:01:47.480
 then I have another one here 

00:01:46.910 --> 00:01:49.670
 can 

00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:51.830
 However, it already has its cover 

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:54.680
 that's why the kneading is lost 

00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:58.640
 relatively dry that is natural 

00:01:54.680 --> 00:02:00.770
 really not so optimal here we 

00:01:58.640 --> 00:02:15.770
 then another press with different ones 

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:16.940
 granule another dose I knead 

00:02:15.770 --> 00:02:18.530
 But I am surprised that the 

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:20.120
 Packages already more or less up 

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:22.519
 as we have that too 

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:26.300
 The cardboard also looks relative 

00:02:22.519 --> 00:02:29.150
 he forbids this after second 

00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:32.209
 and or so out though the kneading is still in 

00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:41.030
 its original form here have 

00:02:32.209 --> 00:02:45.700
 now pinkl kneading and white kneading with 

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:45.700
 so a grayish Stichert 

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:54.249
 each still the lid of the red 

00:02:51.099 --> 00:02:57.280
 he knocks us unfortunately is at 

00:02:54.249 --> 00:03:03.269
 transport and once light blue 

00:02:57.280 --> 00:03:03.269
 kneel that was it corner tong is according 

00:03:06.959 --> 00:03:12.010
 then we build the lollipop maker once 

00:03:09.639 --> 00:03:14.430
 fast on here our underground 

00:03:12.010 --> 00:03:16.989
 which I also missed a bit 

00:03:14.430 --> 00:03:18.669
 is an instruction so neither 

00:03:16.989 --> 00:03:21.430
 Warnhinweise still if you the whole 

00:03:18.669 --> 00:03:24.790
 builds together even if that is easy 

00:03:21.430 --> 00:03:32.280
 I would always have a guide anyway 

00:03:24.790 --> 00:03:36.340
 like to have ours here now 

00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:39.340
 machine okay if you press up here 

00:03:36.340 --> 00:03:41.530
 then these two arms are squeezing here 

00:03:39.340 --> 00:03:43.780
 together and there we will be 

00:03:41.530 --> 00:03:45.449
 probably our form 

00:03:43.780 --> 00:03:48.579
 harness 

00:03:45.449 --> 00:03:59.650
 We'll just catch the ice 

00:03:48.579 --> 00:04:01.439
 lolly the other ever to 

00:03:59.650 --> 00:04:05.409
 function 

00:04:01.439 --> 00:04:09.159
 then we have another one here 

00:04:05.409 --> 00:04:12.370
 Forms for the lollies 

00:04:09.159 --> 00:04:16.479
 work just as different 

00:04:12.370 --> 00:04:19.169
 colors as silence in turquoise pink yellow 

00:04:16.479 --> 00:04:19.169
 and blue 

00:04:19.229 --> 00:04:25.199
 and of course our knead 

00:04:27.090 --> 00:04:30.680
 where the red is probably not 

00:04:29.250 --> 00:04:34.080
 to use more 

00:04:30.680 --> 00:04:36.780
 This is already totally upwards 

00:04:34.080 --> 00:04:40.620
 crystalline so here it seems 

00:04:36.780 --> 00:04:43.560
 correctly sold 

00:04:40.620 --> 00:04:46.500
 and down she was still relatively the but 

00:04:43.560 --> 00:04:48.479
 also pretty tough and above all 

00:04:46.500 --> 00:04:52.260
 also brittle so no longer elastic 

00:04:48.479 --> 00:04:53.760
 but totally crumbly we will 

00:04:52.260 --> 00:04:56.370
 I probably can not use it 

00:04:53.760 --> 00:04:58.650
 I think maybe I'll be a red 

00:04:56.370 --> 00:05:03.090
 play doh use play doh 

00:04:58.650 --> 00:05:09.060
 I find the smell relatively intense 

00:05:03.090 --> 00:05:10.770
 but also first a typical smell and then 

00:05:09.060 --> 00:05:12.870
 we have a white knelt here 

00:05:10.770 --> 00:05:14.580
 I would say in the next video 

00:05:12.870 --> 00:05:15.930
 We then together once ran the course 

00:05:14.580 --> 00:05:18.000
 Try the maker 

00:05:15.930 --> 00:05:19.380
 I hope you liked my video 

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:21.450
 give me a thumbs up 

00:05:19.380 --> 00:05:23.100
 leave her nice comments and 

00:05:21.450 --> 00:05:23.789
 Of course, do not forget the channel too 

00:05:23.100 --> 00:05:25.199
 subscribe to 

00:05:23.789 --> 00:05:27.740
 See you next time 

00:05:25.199 --> 00:05:27.740
 bye
