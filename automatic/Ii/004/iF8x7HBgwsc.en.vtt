00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:37.950 
ships in you can get these a u-haul I

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:39.560 
ships in you can get these a u-haul I
think<00:01:38.280> they<00:01:38.340> call<00:01:38.549> them<00:01:38.610> ear<00:01:38.880> boxes<00:01:39.360> and

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:39.570 
think they call them ear boxes and

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:43.520 
think they call them ear boxes and
they're<00:01:39.720> relatively<00:01:40.170> economical<00:01:40.909> and<00:01:42.110> so<00:01:43.110> one

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:43.530 
they're relatively economical and so one

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:45.980 
they're relatively economical and so one
one<00:01:43.890> nice<00:01:44.070> box<00:01:44.340> like<00:01:44.610> that<00:01:44.780> sometimes<00:01:45.780> you<00:01:45.810> can

00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:47.520 
double box but the foam core really

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:49.789 
double box but the foam core really
obviates<00:01:48.090> the<00:01:48.210> need<00:01:48.270> for<00:01:48.450> a<00:01:48.689> second<00:01:48.990> box<00:01:49.170> and

00:02:19.240 --> 00:02:19.250 
cut to get this size right and you can

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:21.369 
cut to get this size right and you can
do<00:02:19.370> that<00:02:19.549> with<00:02:19.790> your<00:02:20.030> with<00:02:20.959> your<00:02:21.110> utility

your edges and get a little overhang
that's<00:02:48.379> kind<00:02:48.590> of<00:02:48.620> nice<00:02:48.799> and<00:02:49.160> then<00:02:49.760> here's<00:02:50.000> the

00:02:50.050 --> 00:02:50.060 
that's kind of nice and then here's the

00:02:50.060 --> 00:02:52.119 
that's kind of nice and then here's the
other<00:02:50.239> board<00:02:50.510> on<00:02:50.629> top<00:02:50.660> and<00:02:51.560> then<00:02:51.950> we're<00:02:52.040> going

00:02:52.119 --> 00:02:52.129 
other board on top and then we're going

00:02:52.129 --> 00:02:54.280 
other board on top and then we're going
to<00:02:52.190> take<00:02:52.370> this<00:02:52.489> vinyl<00:02:52.879> wrap<00:02:53.090> I'm<00:02:54.049> going<00:02:54.230> to

00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:54.290 
to take this vinyl wrap I'm going to

00:02:54.290 --> 00:02:56.110 
to take this vinyl wrap I'm going to
show<00:02:54.410> you<00:02:54.470> how<00:02:54.680> this<00:02:54.829> works<00:02:55.040> because<00:02:55.370> it's<00:02:55.519> I

00:02:56.110 --> 00:02:56.120 
show you how this works because it's I

00:02:56.120 --> 00:02:57.819 
show you how this works because it's I
guess<00:02:56.269> it's<00:02:56.450> not<00:02:56.540> totally<00:02:56.959> intuitive<00:02:57.290> but<00:02:57.620> you

00:02:57.819 --> 00:02:57.829 
guess it's not totally intuitive but you

00:02:57.829 --> 00:02:59.530 
guess it's not totally intuitive but you
can<00:02:58.010> make<00:02:58.160> one<00:02:58.400> continuous<00:02:59.030> loop<00:02:59.209> with<00:02:59.420> this

00:02:59.530 --> 00:02:59.540 
can make one continuous loop with this

00:02:59.540 --> 00:03:02.110 
can make one continuous loop with this
stuff<00:02:59.870> because<00:03:00.530> it's<00:03:00.650> self<00:03:00.859> adhering<00:03:01.220> so<00:03:02.060> you

00:03:02.110 --> 00:03:02.120 
stuff because it's self adhering so you

00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:04.569 
stuff because it's self adhering so you
get<00:03:02.299> it<00:03:02.390> started<00:03:02.930> you<00:03:03.799> have<00:03:03.950> to<00:03:04.069> adhere<00:03:04.220> it<00:03:04.519> to

00:03:04.569 --> 00:03:04.579 
get it started you have to adhere it to

00:03:04.579 --> 00:03:06.430 
get it started you have to adhere it to
itself<00:03:04.970> once<00:03:05.209> it<00:03:05.269> grabs<00:03:05.540> itself<00:03:06.049> now<00:03:06.260> that's

00:03:06.430 --> 00:03:06.440 
itself once it grabs itself now that's

00:03:06.440 --> 00:03:08.259 
itself once it grabs itself now that's
been<00:03:06.560> around<00:03:06.769> one<00:03:06.920> whole<00:03:07.099> lap<00:03:07.310> you're<00:03:08.060> good<00:03:08.180> to

00:03:08.259 --> 00:03:08.269 
been around one whole lap you're good to

00:03:08.269 --> 00:03:10.569 
been around one whole lap you're good to
go<00:03:08.329> and<00:03:08.569> you<00:03:08.660> can<00:03:08.690> remove<00:03:09.590> with<00:03:09.799> impunity<00:03:10.190> with

00:03:10.569 --> 00:03:10.579 
go and you can remove with impunity with

00:03:10.579 --> 00:03:13.690 
go and you can remove with impunity with
it<00:03:10.730> so<00:03:11.180> you<00:03:11.870> be<00:03:12.290> your<00:03:12.380> corners<00:03:12.799> same<00:03:13.400> sort<00:03:13.670> of

00:03:13.690 --> 00:03:13.700 
it so you be your corners same sort of

00:03:13.700 --> 00:03:19.180 
it so you be your corners same sort of
deal<00:03:13.940> you<00:03:14.269> can<00:03:14.780> just<00:03:14.989> turn<00:03:15.500> on<00:03:15.769> itself<00:03:16.160> so<00:03:18.190> I

00:03:19.180 --> 00:03:19.190 
deal you can just turn on itself so I

00:03:19.190 --> 00:03:21.159 
deal you can just turn on itself so I
can<00:03:19.400> get<00:03:19.609> I<00:03:19.790> can<00:03:20.000> get<00:03:20.150> two<00:03:20.329> sides<00:03:20.630> of<00:03:20.810> this<00:03:20.930> done

00:03:21.159 --> 00:03:21.169 
can get I can get two sides of this done

00:03:21.169 --> 00:03:25.360 
can get I can get two sides of this done
and<00:03:21.500> then<00:03:21.650> I<00:03:21.739> just<00:03:21.980> flip<00:03:22.579> the<00:03:22.900> big<00:03:23.900> mass<00:03:24.590> 180

00:03:25.360 --> 00:03:25.370 
and then I just flip the big mass 180

00:03:25.370 --> 00:03:28.330 
and then I just flip the big mass 180
degrees<00:03:25.790> that's<00:03:26.269> right<00:03:27.010> and<00:03:28.010> I'm<00:03:28.130> going<00:03:28.280> to

00:03:28.330 --> 00:03:28.340 
degrees that's right and I'm going to

00:03:28.340 --> 00:03:30.099 
degrees that's right and I'm going to
turn<00:03:28.549> the<00:03:28.639> corner<00:03:28.849> again<00:03:29.180> so<00:03:29.540> I<00:03:29.569> just<00:03:29.780> turn<00:03:30.019> it

00:03:30.099 --> 00:03:30.109 
turn the corner again so I just turn it

00:03:30.109 --> 00:03:33.129 
turn the corner again so I just turn it
on<00:03:30.169> itself<00:03:30.700> it's<00:03:31.700> a<00:03:31.819> little<00:03:32.060> bit<00:03:32.209> ad<00:03:32.419> hoc<00:03:32.780> or

00:03:33.129 --> 00:03:33.139 
on itself it's a little bit ad hoc or

00:03:33.139 --> 00:03:37.379 
on itself it's a little bit ad hoc or
improvised<00:03:34.130> but<00:03:34.579> it<00:03:34.840> works<00:03:35.840> great<00:03:36.139> and<00:03:36.380> then

00:03:37.379 --> 00:03:37.389 
improvised but it works great and then

00:03:37.389 --> 00:03:40.990 
improvised but it works great and then
say<00:03:38.389> deal<00:03:38.690> here<00:03:39.250> so<00:03:40.250> now<00:03:40.370> we<00:03:40.400> have<00:03:40.609> a<00:03:40.669> cave

00:03:40.990 --> 00:03:41.000 
say deal here so now we have a cave

00:03:51.580 --> 00:03:51.590 
had no tape or anything in the mix so

00:03:51.590 --> 00:03:54.309 
had no tape or anything in the mix so
the<00:03:51.769> next<00:03:51.950> step<00:03:52.220> is<00:03:53.000> really<00:03:53.060> to<00:03:53.630> get<00:03:54.049> it<00:03:54.139> in<00:03:54.230> the

00:03:54.309 --> 00:03:54.319 
the next step is really to get it in the

00:03:54.319 --> 00:03:58.990 
the next step is really to get it in the
box<00:03:54.700> so<00:03:55.700> what<00:03:55.790> I<00:03:55.849> do<00:03:55.970> usually<00:03:57.579> you<00:03:58.579> can<00:03:58.790> mean

00:03:58.990 --> 00:03:59.000 
box so what I do usually you can mean

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:01.089 
box so what I do usually you can mean
other<00:03:59.150> options<00:03:59.720> in<00:03:59.900> terms<00:04:00.109> of<00:04:00.260> units<00:04:00.889> aren't

00:04:01.089 --> 00:04:01.099 
other options in terms of units aren't

00:04:01.099 --> 00:04:02.660 
other options in terms of units aren't

00:04:04.880 --> 00:04:04.890 
time and every day we will achieve but

00:04:04.890 --> 00:04:07.520 
time and every day we will achieve but

bubble<00:04:07.860> wrap<00:04:07.890> it's<00:04:08.730> easier<00:04:09.060> for<00:04:09.120> the<00:04:09.330> end<00:04:09.510> user

00:04:09.710 --> 00:04:09.720 
bubble wrap it's easier for the end user

00:04:09.720 --> 00:04:12.770 
bubble wrap it's easier for the end user
because<00:04:10.349> up<00:04:10.830> is<00:04:11.370> always<00:04:11.790> stupid<00:04:12.239> peanuts<00:04:12.599> with

00:05:02.700 --> 00:05:02.710 
ton I'm going to kind of move the

00:05:02.710 --> 00:05:06.210 
ton I'm going to kind of move the
painting<00:05:03.220> around<00:05:03.360> so<00:05:04.360> the<00:05:04.419> peanuts<00:05:04.949> fill<00:05:05.949> both

00:05:06.210 --> 00:05:06.220 
painting around so the peanuts fill both

00:05:06.220 --> 00:05:13.529 
painting around so the peanuts fill both
sides<00:05:06.550> of<00:05:06.850> it<00:05:11.910> apart<00:05:12.910> we<00:05:13.090> might<00:05:13.270> going<00:05:13.419> to<00:05:13.479> go

00:05:13.529 --> 00:05:13.539 
sides of it apart we might going to go

00:05:13.539 --> 00:05:17.250 
sides of it apart we might going to go
make<00:05:13.720> popcorn<00:05:13.770> yeah<00:05:15.660> and<00:05:16.660> the<00:05:16.960> painting

00:05:17.250 --> 00:05:17.260 
make popcorn yeah and the painting

00:05:17.260 --> 00:05:18.659 
make popcorn yeah and the painting
create<00:05:17.500> takes<00:05:17.800> up<00:05:17.949> a<00:05:18.010> fair<00:05:18.220> amount<00:05:18.310> of<00:05:18.460> space

00:05:18.659 --> 00:05:18.669 
create takes up a fair amount of space

00:05:18.669 --> 00:05:20.879 
create takes up a fair amount of space
inside<00:05:19.210> the<00:05:19.360> box<00:05:19.690> and<00:05:19.870> prepare<00:05:20.199> TFTP<00:05:20.800> know

00:05:20.879 --> 00:05:20.889 
inside the box and prepare TFTP know

00:05:20.889 --> 00:05:34.619 
inside the box and prepare TFTP know
from<00:05:21.070> the<00:05:21.130> bottom<00:05:21.490> the<00:05:21.580> center<00:05:21.820> etc

00:05:34.619 --> 00:05:34.629 

00:05:34.629 --> 00:05:38.409 

so<00:05:35.629> carefully<00:05:36.590> sort<00:05:37.009> of<00:05:37.099> making<00:05:37.970> sure<00:05:38.389> that

00:05:38.409 --> 00:05:38.419 
so carefully sort of making sure that

00:05:38.419 --> 00:05:41.950 
so carefully sort of making sure that
all<00:05:38.810> the<00:05:38.960> cavities<00:05:39.789> get<00:05:40.789> filled<00:05:41.120> one<00:05:41.599> little

00:05:41.950 --> 00:05:41.960 
all the cavities get filled one little

00:05:41.960 --> 00:05:43.570 
all the cavities get filled one little
trick<00:05:42.259> is<00:05:42.440> you<00:05:42.530> can<00:05:42.680> sort<00:05:42.800> of<00:05:42.919> bow<00:05:43.099> the<00:05:43.310> sides

00:05:43.570 --> 00:05:43.580 
trick is you can sort of bow the sides

00:05:43.580 --> 00:05:45.309 
trick is you can sort of bow the sides
out<00:05:43.849> like<00:05:44.120> I<00:05:44.240> was<00:05:44.360> just<00:05:44.569> doing<00:05:44.870> you<00:05:44.900> know<00:05:45.110> just

the<00:06:11.150> top<00:06:12.430> then<00:06:13.430> that's<00:06:13.909> when<00:06:14.060> the<00:06:14.120> tape<00:06:14.300> comes

00:06:14.529 --> 00:06:14.539 
the top then that's when the tape comes

00:06:14.539 --> 00:06:16.290 
the top then that's when the tape comes
in<00:06:14.720> we<00:06:14.840> don't<00:06:15.020> use<00:06:15.139> the<00:06:15.259> tape<00:06:15.440> until<00:06:15.770> the<00:06:15.860> end

00:06:16.290 --> 00:06:16.300 
in we don't use the tape until the end

00:06:16.300 --> 00:06:18.930 
in we don't use the tape until the end
and<00:06:17.300> it's<00:06:17.479> just<00:06:17.509> to<00:06:17.750> seal<00:06:17.930> the<00:06:18.050> box<00:06:18.229> shell<00:06:18.530> and
