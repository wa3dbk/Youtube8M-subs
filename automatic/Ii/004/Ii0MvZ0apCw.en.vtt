 Kozyrev 

00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:14.250
 the third quarter came to an end than he 

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:16.230
 was significant for building 

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:18.480
 market Petersburg what were the demand and 

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:20.220
 suggestions talk to the head 

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:20.789
 consulting center Petersburg 

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:23.119

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:25.800
 Olga cable Hello Olga 

00:00:23.119 --> 00:00:27.840
 please tell me here are the fall trends 

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:30.810
 in the primary market that is in one of 

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:32.579
 summer programs you said that in the fall 

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:33.630
 apartment prices can rise by 

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:37.800
 ten percent 

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:41.489
 Whether this happened, we talked in 2014 

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:43.680
 forecast in general, yes for the year if we talk 

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:46.260
 sum up 9 months 

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:48.930
 then the average prices rose by 

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:50.580
 St. Petersburg in the mass segment 

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:52.680
 by 6 6 percent that basically 

00:00:50.580 --> 00:00:54.930
 corresponds to inflation 

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:57.300
 St. Petersburg in the suburban area 

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:59.760
 growth is somewhat lower due to active 

00:00:57.300 --> 00:01:00.300
 the construction of housing is mass 

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:03.030
 segment 

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:05.489
 including an economy class of two and nine 

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:06.030
 percent connect rose over 9 

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:09.270
 months 

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:11.810
 if we talk about the results of the summer autumn 

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:14.070
 period where the third quarter then 

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:16.800
 fluctuations were also positive on 

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:17.520
 a few percent also price 

00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:20.100
 rose 

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:21.780
 but if prices continue to rise by 

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:23.759
 Your opinion is affected by a number of factors. 

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:25.759
 yes including the activity there and 

00:01:23.759 --> 00:01:27.570
 the emergence of new projects also 

00:01:25.759 --> 00:01:30.180
 construction readiness of which 

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:32.759
 rises at a number of objects and we 

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:35.790
 we predict that the average height 

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:37.770
 for 2014 will be somewhere at 

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:40.640
 inflation is in principle still ahead 

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:43.590
 fourth quarter trend will continue 

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:46.200
 small slight adjustment in 

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:46.640
 up side of the floor 

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:50.759
 this 

00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:53.010
 a few tenths there a month and here 

00:01:50.759 --> 00:01:54.930
 such a rapid growth of the euro he 

00:01:53.010 --> 00:01:58.200
 may affect the price increase 

00:01:54.930 --> 00:02:01.590
 somehow jumps or jumps all the same not 

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:03.659
 will actually the real estate market 

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:06.960
 behaves quite steadily that is 

00:02:03.659 --> 00:02:09.690
 in respect and demand dynamics stable 

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:11.340
 sales developers are actively 

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:14.310
 working on the market, bringing new projects 

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:17.220
 and in principle demand activity she and 

00:02:14.310 --> 00:02:20.820
 dictates including the reaction and yes 

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:23.580
 movements on prices say exactly what we are 

00:02:20.820 --> 00:02:26.370
 now see the effects of fluctuations there 

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:30.209
 course prices I can't say so 

00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:32.160
 yes, that is simply an increase in essence 

00:02:30.209 --> 00:02:35.070
 pricing associated with certain factors 

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:36.720
 a number of objects present in the market 

00:02:35.070 --> 00:02:37.739
 a number of objects are rising prices are displayed 

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:39.870
 including some objects 

00:02:37.739 --> 00:02:42.750
 comfort class which also structure 

00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:44.640
 affects the overall average price we say 

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:45.840
 about average indicators average prices price 

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:48.450
 offers 

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:50.340
 if you look at the objects separately 

00:02:48.450 --> 00:02:51.930
 situations may be different somewhere 

00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:53.790
 more somewhere increase the price is enough 

00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:56.519
 stable ie it depends on 

00:02:53.790 --> 00:02:58.500
 property developers policies in some way 

00:02:56.519 --> 00:02:59.370
 the offer is changing due to 

00:02:58.500 --> 00:03:01.980
 boost 

00:02:59.370 --> 00:03:05.250
 at the end of 14 years both in principle 

00:03:01.980 --> 00:03:07.680
 In recent years, the market has been active 

00:03:05.250 --> 00:03:11.519
 construction is the same residential construction and 

00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:13.019
 volumes of emerging new projects and not 

00:03:11.519 --> 00:03:15.690
 at the level of us absolutely millions 

00:03:13.019 --> 00:03:17.220
 Treasure Quarter Hosts New Objects But 

00:03:15.690 --> 00:03:18.900
 this corresponds to the prevailing 

00:03:17.220 --> 00:03:21.120
 formed last again 

00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:23.370
 periods by demand volume because 

00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:25.950
 summing up again the 3 quarter volume 

00:03:23.370 --> 00:03:28.500
 demand exceeded about one million 

00:03:25.950 --> 00:03:30.510
 square meters it was realized that in 

00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:32.250
 principle corresponds to certain 

00:03:30.510 --> 00:03:34.349
 the volume that formed the last 

00:03:32.250 --> 00:03:36.299
 time that is at the level of a million little 

00:03:34.349 --> 00:03:37.140
 more yes that is in the implementation quarter 

00:03:36.299 --> 00:03:40.590
 housing 

00:03:37.140 --> 00:03:43.980
 what else new trends have appeared 

00:03:40.590 --> 00:03:47.430
 on the market here for the time being summing up 

00:03:43.980 --> 00:03:49.500
 results we can say that the demand for 14 year 

00:03:47.430 --> 00:03:52.140
 Now we can say yes there is still 

00:03:49.500 --> 00:03:54.480
 fourth quarter will increase by 

00:03:52.140 --> 00:03:57.030
 in relation to the 13th year in the range of 20 

00:03:54.480 --> 00:03:59.220
 percent that says about activity 

00:03:57.030 --> 00:04:02.430
 significant and purchasing on that 

00:03:59.220 --> 00:04:03.870
 including developers are now actively 

00:04:02.430 --> 00:04:05.819
 withdraw new projects 

00:04:03.870 --> 00:04:07.980
 actively developing continues 

00:04:05.819 --> 00:04:11.130
 develop suburban area with 

00:04:07.980 --> 00:04:12.840
 offer in certain areas of the 

00:04:11.130 --> 00:04:15.329
 there Vsevolozhsky district he replenished 

00:04:12.840 --> 00:04:17.039
 leading in volume but including 

00:04:15.329 --> 00:04:19.109
 this year a lot has started 

00:04:17.039 --> 00:04:21.239
 interesting new large-scale projects 

00:04:19.109 --> 00:04:22.830
 large-scale areas, you can probably do it 

00:04:21.239 --> 00:04:25.039
 note including possible in the south 

00:04:22.830 --> 00:04:27.210
 note there is a sunny city too 

00:04:25.039 --> 00:04:30.180
 one million square meters there 

00:04:27.210 --> 00:04:32.070
 it will probably be built here 

00:04:30.180 --> 00:04:34.020
 to celebrate such a large period 

00:04:32.070 --> 00:04:35.460
 large-scale projects that are exactly on 

00:04:34.020 --> 00:04:37.199
 the territory of St. Petersburg will be 

00:04:35.460 --> 00:04:39.210
 develop beyond already 

00:04:37.199 --> 00:04:42.110
 existing territories there is an integrated 

00:04:39.210 --> 00:04:43.849
 mastering means supply is increasing 

00:04:42.110 --> 00:04:47.430
 demand 

00:04:43.849 --> 00:04:49.169
 it does not decrease due to unstable 

00:04:47.430 --> 00:04:51.260
 such a situation or vice versa becomes 

00:04:49.169 --> 00:04:55.010
 above that is, people all ran to buy 

00:04:51.260 --> 00:04:57.449
 housing to invest 

00:04:55.010 --> 00:04:58.380
 Again, I stress that in our 

00:04:57.449 --> 00:04:59.940
 projected 

00:04:58.380 --> 00:05:02.610
 20 percent increase in demand 

00:04:59.940 --> 00:05:05.100
 on the basis of 14 years compared to dtsat 

00:05:02.610 --> 00:05:07.380
 we see and note the activity in demand 

00:05:05.100 --> 00:05:08.940
 we as if demand leaders remain 

00:05:07.380 --> 00:05:11.670
 small apartments of this studio 

00:05:08.940 --> 00:05:13.950
 one-bedroom apartments budget 

00:05:11.670 --> 00:05:15.540
 certain options yes there zones there 

00:05:13.950 --> 00:05:17.460
 suburban area act 

00:05:15.540 --> 00:05:19.520
 increased demand lately there 

00:05:17.460 --> 00:05:24.570
 demand share in excess of thirty percent 

00:05:19.520 --> 00:05:25.920
 sales are concentrated but in general 

00:05:24.570 --> 00:05:28.440
 therefore it may be noted that 

00:05:25.920 --> 00:05:30.150
 purchasing power has long been accustomed 

00:05:28.440 --> 00:05:33.080
 of course in a certain budget yes I 

00:05:30.150 --> 00:05:34.800
 shopping but nonetheless we see 

00:05:33.080 --> 00:05:36.600
 positive in this trend 

00:05:34.800 --> 00:05:38.250
 certainly the activity of developers she 

00:05:36.600 --> 00:05:40.650
 leads simply to high competitive 

00:05:38.250 --> 00:05:41.040
 market and this is a plus for the buyer because 

00:05:40.650 --> 00:05:43.260
 what 

00:05:41.040 --> 00:05:45.630
 strive for quality before offer 

00:05:43.260 --> 00:05:48.810
 interesting some additions yes there 

00:05:45.630 --> 00:05:51.720
 architecture either it is there input groups 

00:05:48.810 --> 00:05:54.330
 even in the now mass segment are paying 

00:05:51.720 --> 00:05:55.440
 a lot of attention and a number of others there 

00:05:54.330 --> 00:05:57.330
 apartment renovation 

00:05:55.440 --> 00:06:01.380
 so for buyer here only 

00:05:57.330 --> 00:06:02.340
 The pros of the real estate market are demand for 

00:06:01.380 --> 00:06:05.510
 real estate market 

00:06:02.340 --> 00:06:08.610
 it somehow depends on seasonality 

00:06:05.510 --> 00:06:11.160
 certainly but in recent years with 

00:06:08.610 --> 00:06:12.960
 on demand activity yes we don't even not 

00:06:11.160 --> 00:06:15.270
 have seen such significant drops in a 

00:06:12.960 --> 00:06:18.840
 rise only yes it was the thirteenth 

00:06:15.270 --> 00:06:20.010
 year 12 now in the summertime was 

00:06:18.840 --> 00:06:23.560
 marked by nicknames 

00:06:20.010 --> 00:06:26.830
 some seasonality but none the less 

00:06:23.560 --> 00:06:29.680
 the end again august-september showed 

00:06:26.830 --> 00:06:32.680
 this is a certain growth and stable demand 

00:06:29.680 --> 00:06:36.960
 and what it is connected with and what exactly 

00:06:32.680 --> 00:06:39.970
 august-september demand increased in summer 

00:06:36.960 --> 00:06:42.250
 took everything where then surely there is 

00:06:39.970 --> 00:06:45.220
 holiday period there are some periods 

00:06:42.250 --> 00:06:47.470
 when in this celebration we have this and this 

00:06:45.220 --> 00:06:49.360
 reflected yes there if it 's New Year's 

00:06:47.470 --> 00:06:52.740
 whether this may holidays 

00:06:49.360 --> 00:06:56.320
 there on the volumes of transactions there it is reflected 

00:06:52.740 --> 00:06:57.790
 so the principle of the earlier market is always this 

00:06:56.320 --> 00:07:00.000
 felt but here was the rise 

00:06:57.790 --> 00:07:03.280
 certain period of this several years 

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:05.650
 after the tenth year when the market volume 

00:07:03.280 --> 00:07:07.450
 when times have become much even this 

00:07:05.650 --> 00:07:09.360
 factor we did not observe yes now we 

00:07:07.450 --> 00:07:11.830
 just back to the nike stable 

00:07:09.360 --> 00:07:13.720
 classic development when this factor 

00:07:11.830 --> 00:07:15.880
 of course it has an effect on 

00:07:13.720 --> 00:07:18.270
 certain periods but nonetheless 

00:07:15.880 --> 00:07:21.580
 overall volume of demand will grow 

00:07:18.270 --> 00:07:23.760
 despite some fluctuations thanks 

00:07:21.580 --> 00:07:26.140
 I wish you all the best 

00:07:23.760 --> 00:07:27.580
 remind guest studio today was
