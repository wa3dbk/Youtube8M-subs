00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:54.390 
incredibly exciting challenge to to try

incredibly exciting challenge to to try
something<00:00:54.840> like<00:00:55.050> this<00:00:55.260> where<00:00:55.590> not<00:00:56.489> only<00:00:56.520> it

00:00:56.779 --> 00:00:56.789 
something like this where not only it

00:00:56.789 --> 00:00:59.180 
something like this where not only it
was<00:00:56.910> a<00:00:56.940> character<00:00:57.600> so<00:00:57.780> unique<00:00:58.140> to<00:00:58.410> me<00:00:58.559> but<00:00:58.800> but

00:00:59.180 --> 00:00:59.190 
was a character so unique to me but but

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:02.709 
was a character so unique to me but but
just<00:00:59.879> the<00:01:00.000> making<00:01:00.149> of<00:01:00.390> the<00:01:00.480> film<00:01:00.660> was

00:01:02.709 --> 00:01:02.719 
just the making of the film was

00:01:02.719 --> 00:01:05.000 
just the making of the film was
incomprehensible<00:01:03.719> to<00:01:04.199> me<00:01:04.320> really<00:01:04.530> and<00:01:04.860> then

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:05.010 
incomprehensible to me really and then

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:06.830 
incomprehensible to me really and then
and<00:01:05.400> then<00:01:05.610> all<00:01:05.760> of<00:01:05.790> a<00:01:05.880> sudden<00:01:05.909> it<00:01:06.330> started<00:01:06.659> to

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:06.840 
and then all of a sudden it started to

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:10.399 
and then all of a sudden it started to
sort<00:01:07.049> of<00:01:07.110> I<00:01:08.420> started<00:01:09.420> to<00:01:09.510> really<00:01:09.659> fall<00:01:09.990> into<00:01:10.200> it

00:01:10.399 --> 00:01:10.409 
sort of I started to really fall into it

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:13.440 
sort of I started to really fall into it
in<00:01:10.680> a<00:01:10.830> way<00:01:10.979> that<00:01:11.010> really

00:01:13.440 --> 00:01:13.450 
in a way that really

00:01:13.450 --> 00:01:15.749 
in a way that really
just<00:01:14.200> from<00:01:14.289> doing<00:01:14.560> it<00:01:14.680> just<00:01:15.189> jumping<00:01:15.460> in<00:01:15.579> you

00:01:15.749 --> 00:01:15.759
