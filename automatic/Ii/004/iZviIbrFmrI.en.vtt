guides<00:00:10.080> where<00:00:10.740> we<00:00:10.860> look<00:00:11.040> at<00:00:11.160> each<00:00:11.429> piece<00:00:11.820> of

00:00:12.020 --> 00:00:12.030 
guides where we look at each piece of

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:14.330 
guides where we look at each piece of
exotic<00:00:12.480> armor<00:00:12.840> in<00:00:12.990> depth<00:00:13.320> compare<00:00:14.130> them<00:00:14.309> to

exotic armor in depth compare them to

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:16.490 
exotic armor in depth compare them to
other<00:00:14.549> exotics<00:00:15.330> within<00:00:15.660> the<00:00:15.750> same<00:00:15.960> category

00:00:16.490 --> 00:00:16.500 
other exotics within the same category

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:18.290 
other exotics within the same category
and<00:00:16.710> come<00:00:17.340> to<00:00:17.490> a<00:00:17.520> conclusion<00:00:17.609> you<00:00:18.180> know

00:00:18.290 --> 00:00:18.300 
and come to a conclusion you know

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:20.840 
and come to a conclusion you know
because<00:00:18.570> we<00:00:18.690> can<00:00:18.810> only<00:00:19.020> equip<00:00:20.010> one<00:00:20.400> piece<00:00:20.670> of

00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:20.850 
because we can only equip one piece of

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:22.370 
because we can only equip one piece of
exotic<00:00:21.240> armor<00:00:21.539> at<00:00:21.630> a<00:00:21.689> time<00:00:21.900> so<00:00:22.109> it's<00:00:22.230> really

00:00:22.370 --> 00:00:22.380 
exotic armor at a time so it's really

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:24.170 
exotic armor at a time so it's really
important<00:00:22.980> to<00:00:23.100> weigh<00:00:23.310> the<00:00:23.340> options<00:00:23.699> you<00:00:24.060> know

00:00:24.170 --> 00:00:24.180 
important to weigh the options you know

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:27.200 
important to weigh the options you know
is<00:00:24.330> this<00:00:24.510> piece<00:00:24.810> good<00:00:25.050> in<00:00:25.170> pvp<00:00:25.769> or<00:00:25.980> PVE<00:00:26.279> and

00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:27.210 
is this piece good in pvp or PVE and

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:29.810 
is this piece good in pvp or PVE and
which<00:00:27.990> subclass<00:00:28.529> is<00:00:28.800> the<00:00:28.920> best<00:00:29.130> to<00:00:29.310> use<00:00:29.519> with

00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:29.820 
which subclass is the best to use with

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:32.120 
which subclass is the best to use with
each<00:00:30.090> piece<00:00:30.449> of<00:00:30.480> armor<00:00:30.869> so<00:00:31.529> this<00:00:31.679> time<00:00:31.920> our

00:00:32.120 --> 00:00:32.130 
each piece of armor so this time our

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:34.130 
each piece of armor so this time our
focus<00:00:32.460> is<00:00:32.610> on<00:00:32.730> the<00:00:32.910> helm<00:00:33.180> of<00:00:33.390> in<00:00:33.570> most<00:00:33.840> light

00:00:34.130 --> 00:00:34.140 
focus is on the helm of in most light

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:37.010 
focus is on the helm of in most light
which<00:00:34.440> is<00:00:34.590> a<00:00:34.620> Titan<00:00:35.160> only<00:00:35.640> helmet<00:00:36.090> the<00:00:36.690> only

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:37.020 
which is a Titan only helmet the only

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:38.720 
which is a Titan only helmet the only
armor<00:00:37.440> stat<00:00:37.710> we<00:00:37.890> have<00:00:37.920> on<00:00:38.280> the<00:00:38.399> helm<00:00:38.610> of

00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:38.730 
armor stat we have on the helm of

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:40.459 
armor stat we have on the helm of
endless<00:00:39.000> light<00:00:39.360> is<00:00:39.570> strength<00:00:40.200> and<00:00:40.440> that

00:00:40.459 --> 00:00:40.469 
endless light is strength and that

00:00:40.469 --> 00:00:42.979 
endless light is strength and that
reduces<00:00:41.190> the<00:00:41.550> cooldown<00:00:41.879> of<00:00:42.329> our<00:00:42.570> melee

00:00:42.979 --> 00:00:42.989 
reduces the cooldown of our melee

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:45.350 
reduces the cooldown of our melee
ability<00:00:43.469> so<00:00:44.010> if<00:00:44.100> you're<00:00:44.219> running<00:00:44.309> striker<00:00:44.850> you

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:45.360 
ability so if you're running striker you

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:47.360 
ability so if you're running striker you
will<00:00:45.480> have<00:00:45.719> the<00:00:45.960> storm<00:00:46.350> fist<00:00:46.649> melee<00:00:47.160> and

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:47.370 
will have the storm fist melee and

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:50.840 
will have the storm fist melee and
defender<00:00:48.239> will<00:00:48.780> have<00:00:49.190> disintegrate<00:00:50.190> so<00:00:50.579> in

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:50.850 
defender will have disintegrate so in

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:53.840 
defender will have disintegrate so in
terms<00:00:51.390> of<00:00:51.570> subclasses<00:00:52.469> the<00:00:52.980> hell<00:00:53.460> of<00:00:53.579> a<00:00:53.670> most

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:53.850 
terms of subclasses the hell of a most

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:56.150 
terms of subclasses the hell of a most
light<00:00:54.030> is<00:00:54.180> great<00:00:54.719> it<00:00:54.930> is<00:00:54.960> superb<00:00:55.710> for<00:00:56.070> the

00:00:56.150 --> 00:00:56.160 
light is great it is superb for the

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:58.520 
light is great it is superb for the
striker<00:00:56.460> and<00:00:56.789> it's<00:00:57.329> pretty<00:00:57.600> sub-par<00:00:57.960> middle

00:00:58.520 --> 00:00:58.530 
striker and it's pretty sub-par middle

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:00.380 
striker and it's pretty sub-par middle
of<00:00:58.620> the<00:00:58.739> road<00:00:58.920> for<00:00:59.160> the<00:00:59.250> defender<00:00:59.670> and<00:00:59.820> I'm

00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:00.390 
of the road for the defender and I'm

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:02.389 
of the road for the defender and I'm
going<00:01:00.539> to<00:01:00.570> illustrate<00:01:00.809> exactly<00:01:01.410> why<00:01:01.980> this<00:01:02.039> is

00:01:02.389 --> 00:01:02.399 
going to illustrate exactly why this is

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:04.100 
going to illustrate exactly why this is
the<00:01:02.430> case<00:01:02.550> by<00:01:03.090> going<00:01:03.329> over<00:01:03.570> the<00:01:03.870> three

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:04.110 
the case by going over the three

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:06.320 
the case by going over the three
modifiers<00:01:04.650> that<00:01:04.769> are<00:01:04.979> available<00:01:05.100> on<00:01:05.700> this

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:06.330 
modifiers that are available on this

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:09.380 
modifiers that are available on this
helmet<00:01:06.659> the<00:01:07.170> first<00:01:07.409> one<00:01:07.619> is<00:01:07.650> rain<00:01:08.250> blows<00:01:08.700> which

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:09.390 
helmet the first one is rain blows which

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:11.570 
helmet the first one is rain blows which
increases<00:01:09.900> melee<00:01:10.380> attack<00:01:10.710> speed<00:01:11.040> and<00:01:11.280> you

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:11.580 
increases melee attack speed and you

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:14.359 
increases melee attack speed and you
know<00:01:11.700> that's<00:01:11.880> really<00:01:12.180> useful<00:01:12.930> on<00:01:13.500> you<00:01:14.280> know

00:01:14.359 --> 00:01:14.369 
know that's really useful on you know

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:16.910 
know that's really useful on you know
whichever<00:01:14.760> subclass<00:01:15.720> you<00:01:16.049> are<00:01:16.200> running<00:01:16.439> it's

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:16.920 
whichever subclass you are running it's

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:18.230 
whichever subclass you are running it's
not<00:01:17.100> really<00:01:17.250> specific<00:01:17.820> I<00:01:17.909> guess<00:01:18.090> you<00:01:18.210> could

00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:18.240 
not really specific I guess you could

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:20.450 
not really specific I guess you could
say<00:01:18.570> that<00:01:18.600> the<00:01:19.200> striker<00:01:19.560> is<00:01:19.740> more<00:01:19.979> offense

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:20.460 
say that the striker is more offense

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:22.700 
say that the striker is more offense
based<00:01:20.850> and<00:01:21.119> the<00:01:21.450> defender<00:01:21.930> is<00:01:21.960> more<00:01:22.229> defensive

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:22.710 
based and the defender is more defensive

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:24.890 
based and the defender is more defensive
and<00:01:22.890> you<00:01:23.820> can<00:01:23.970> make<00:01:24.090> a<00:01:24.119> case<00:01:24.360> that<00:01:24.390> it's<00:01:24.689> better

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:24.900 
and you can make a case that it's better

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:26.300 
and you can make a case that it's better
for<00:01:25.170> strikers<00:01:25.590> but<00:01:25.770> I<00:01:25.799> think<00:01:26.009> it's<00:01:26.100> really

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:26.310 
for strikers but I think it's really

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:29.569 
for strikers but I think it's really
useful<00:01:26.549> all<00:01:27.000> around<00:01:27.420> for<00:01:27.840> each<00:01:28.500> sub<00:01:28.890> class<00:01:29.100> the

00:01:29.569 --> 00:01:29.579 
useful all around for each sub class the

00:01:29.579 --> 00:01:32.240 
useful all around for each sub class the
next<00:01:29.610> modifier<00:01:30.360> is<00:01:30.829> invigoration<00:01:31.829> which

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:32.250 
next modifier is invigoration which

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:34.190 
next modifier is invigoration which
reduces<00:01:32.759> melee<00:01:33.150> cool<00:01:33.390> down<00:01:33.540> each<00:01:33.840> time<00:01:34.140> you

00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:34.200 
reduces melee cool down each time you

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:37.490 
reduces melee cool down each time you
pick<00:01:34.530> up<00:01:34.680> an<00:01:34.799> orb<00:01:35.009> of<00:01:35.130> light<00:01:35.390> now<00:01:36.390> this<00:01:37.079> is<00:01:37.290> also

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:37.500 
pick up an orb of light now this is also

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:39.620 
pick up an orb of light now this is also
useful<00:01:37.829> for<00:01:38.040> both<00:01:38.340> subclasses<00:01:38.970> because<00:01:39.360> the

00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:39.630 
useful for both subclasses because the

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:41.270 
useful for both subclasses because the
striker<00:01:39.960> and<00:01:40.229> offender<00:01:40.590> they<00:01:40.740> both<00:01:40.979> have

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:41.280 
striker and offender they both have

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:44.090 
striker and offender they both have
really<00:01:41.939> effective<00:01:42.479> ways<00:01:42.720> to<00:01:42.750> produce<00:01:43.200> orbs<00:01:43.979> of

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:44.100 
really effective ways to produce orbs of

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:46.819 
really effective ways to produce orbs of
light<00:01:44.159> and<00:01:44.610> so<00:01:45.390> you<00:01:45.659> know<00:01:45.689> for<00:01:46.259> example<00:01:46.619> the

and there's a defender I think ward of

and there's a defender I think ward of
dawn<00:02:05.820> modifier<00:02:06.600> that<00:02:06.960> actually<00:02:07.409> increases

the orbs of light that are produced by
putting<00:02:10.950> up<00:02:11.039> a<00:02:11.129> bubble<00:02:11.489> and<00:02:11.670> if<00:02:11.940> that

00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:12.280 
putting up a bubble and if that

00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:14.940 
putting up a bubble and if that
you<00:02:12.640> know<00:02:12.730> gets<00:02:13.569> damaged<00:02:14.140> then<00:02:14.620> it<00:02:14.800> will

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:14.950 
you know gets damaged then it will

00:02:14.950 --> 00:02:17.160 
you know gets damaged then it will
increase<00:02:15.220> it<00:02:15.640> will<00:02:15.850> produce<00:02:16.090> more<00:02:16.569> orbs<00:02:17.080> of

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:21.730 
class right there and then the final

00:02:21.730 --> 00:02:24.150 
class right there and then the final

00:03:09.090 --> 00:03:09.100 
are only in the striker subclass so this

00:03:09.100 --> 00:03:11.520

00:03:16.860 --> 00:03:16.870

00:05:11.219 --> 00:05:11.229 
are you not one shotted and so you know

00:05:11.229 --> 00:05:13.230 
are you not one shotted and so you know
striker<00:05:11.740> gets<00:05:12.009> you<00:05:12.129> into<00:05:12.279> more<00:05:12.580> melee

00:05:13.230 --> 00:05:13.240 
striker gets you into more melee

00:05:13.240 --> 00:05:16.469 
striker gets you into more melee
scenarios<00:05:14.020> than<00:05:14.639> defender<00:05:15.639> does<00:05:15.819> in<00:05:16.060> general

00:05:16.469 --> 00:05:16.479 
scenarios than defender does in general

00:05:16.479 --> 00:05:18.899 
scenarios than defender does in general
that's<00:05:16.659> just<00:05:16.900> my<00:05:17.139> observation<00:05:17.439> and<00:05:18.219> so<00:05:18.699> that's

00:05:18.899 --> 00:05:18.909 
that's just my observation and so that's

00:05:18.909 --> 00:05:21.269 
that's just my observation and so that's
why<00:05:19.180> I<00:05:19.210> say<00:05:19.419> this<00:05:19.779> is<00:05:19.930> an<00:05:20.050> okay<00:05:20.409> helmet<00:05:20.800> for<00:05:20.949> PvE

00:05:21.269 --> 00:05:21.279 
why I say this is an okay helmet for PvE

00:05:21.279 --> 00:05:23.939 
why I say this is an okay helmet for PvE
but<00:05:21.610> it's<00:05:21.729> great<00:05:22.180> for<00:05:22.479> PvP<00:05:22.990> and<00:05:23.139> you
