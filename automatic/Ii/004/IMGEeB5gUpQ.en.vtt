colors and so in this saber and most of

00:01:01.329 --> 00:01:03.989 
colors and so in this saber and most of
my<00:01:01.420> savers<00:01:01.749> I've<00:01:01.870> got<00:01:02.019> a<00:01:02.050> a<00:01:02.350> 10<00:01:02.800> color<00:01:03.160> preset

00:01:05.789 --> 00:01:05.799 
that follows the the patterns of the

00:01:05.799 --> 00:01:07.260 
that follows the the patterns of the
spectrum<00:01:06.250> so<00:01:06.400> the<00:01:06.520> color<00:01:06.729> shifts<00:01:07.060> may<00:01:07.210> be

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:07.270 
spectrum so the color shifts may be

00:01:07.270 --> 00:01:09.179 
spectrum so the color shifts may be
subtle<00:01:07.630> but<00:01:08.140> each<00:01:08.290> time<00:01:08.500> you<00:01:08.590> hear<00:01:08.710> that<00:01:08.860> swing

00:01:09.179 --> 00:01:09.189 
subtle but each time you hear that swing

00:01:09.189 --> 00:01:11.819 
subtle but each time you hear that swing

00:02:01.060 --> 00:02:03.149 
that has that that sound in it or you
could<00:02:01.240> rename<00:02:01.630> any<00:02:01.840> of<00:02:01.990> the<00:02:02.079> sounds<00:02:02.320> color<00:02:02.920> dot

00:02:03.149 --> 00:02:03.159 
could rename any of the sounds color dot

00:02:03.159 --> 00:02:04.380 
could rename any of the sounds color dot
wave<00:02:03.340> and<00:02:03.520> it's<00:02:03.640> gonna<00:02:03.729> function<00:02:04.000> the<00:02:04.240> same

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:04.390 
wave and it's gonna function the same

00:02:04.390 --> 00:02:08.160 
wave and it's gonna function the same
way<00:02:04.920> there's<00:02:05.920> we<00:02:06.009> can<00:02:06.159> get<00:02:06.659> of<00:02:07.659> course<00:02:07.750> i<00:02:07.930> start

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:08.170 
way there's we can get of course i start

00:02:08.170 --> 00:02:09.300 
way there's we can get of course i start
with<00:02:08.259> the<00:02:08.350> green

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:09.310 
with the green

00:02:09.310 --> 00:02:10.859 
with the green
hold<00:02:09.580> Mallik<00:02:09.849> sorry<00:02:10.060> button<00:02:10.330> down<00:02:10.479> and<00:02:10.690> tap

the<00:02:11.290> activation<00:02:11.860> button<00:02:12.099> I<00:02:13.319> got<00:02:14.319> a<00:02:14.349> special

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:14.650 
the activation button I got a special

00:02:14.650 --> 00:02:16.500 
the activation button I got a special
sound<00:02:14.980> it's<00:02:15.520> a<00:02:15.640> little<00:02:15.819> bit<00:02:15.940> slower<00:02:16.270> and

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:16.510 
sound it's a little bit slower and

00:02:16.510 --> 00:02:18.540 
sound it's a little bit slower and
you'll<00:02:16.840> notice<00:02:17.080> that<00:02:17.170> the<00:02:17.349> shifting<00:02:18.310> of<00:02:18.430> the

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:18.550 
you'll notice that the shifting of the

00:02:18.550 --> 00:02:20.220 
you'll notice that the shifting of the
colors<00:02:18.880> actually<00:02:19.390> takes<00:02:19.870> a<00:02:19.959> little<00:02:20.080> bit

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:20.230 
colors actually takes a little bit

00:02:20.230 --> 00:02:21.540 
colors actually takes a little bit
longer<00:02:20.410> because<00:02:20.650> it<00:02:20.890> coincides<00:02:21.310> with<00:02:21.430> the

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:21.550 
longer because it coincides with the

00:02:21.550 --> 00:02:23.610 
longer because it coincides with the
sound<00:02:21.910> of<00:02:22.239> course<00:02:22.569> you<00:02:22.690> can<00:02:22.840> program<00:02:23.020> that<00:02:23.349> set

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:23.620 
sound of course you can program that set

00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:25.260 
sound of course you can program that set
that<00:02:23.830> change<00:02:24.160> that<00:02:24.430> as<00:02:24.819> you<00:02:24.970> can<00:02:25.150> with

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:25.270 
that change that as you can with

00:02:25.270 --> 00:02:26.880 
that change that as you can with
