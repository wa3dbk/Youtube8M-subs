00:00:19.130 --> 00:00:19.140 
nails you don't need much to create this

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:21.260 
nails you don't need much to create this
design<00:00:19.590> and<00:00:19.859> most<00:00:20.070> of<00:00:20.310> the<00:00:20.430> items<00:00:20.760> come<00:00:21.060> in<00:00:21.090> the

nail strips each package has eight so

00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:28.820 
nail strips each package has eight so
you'll<00:00:26.849> have<00:00:26.970> sixteen<00:00:27.510> strips<00:00:27.840> totals<00:00:28.320> then

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:28.830 
you'll have sixteen strips totals then

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:30.980 
you'll have sixteen strips totals then
you'll<00:00:29.010> get<00:00:29.189> a<00:00:29.429> a<00:00:29.460> small<00:00:29.730> buffer<00:00:30.119> and<00:00:30.660> an

you'll get a a small buffer and an

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:32.540 
you'll get a a small buffer and an
orange<00:00:31.289> wood<00:00:31.529> stick<00:00:31.560> along<00:00:32.219> with<00:00:32.279> the

orange wood stick along with the
instructions<00:00:32.850> which<00:00:33.300> are<00:00:33.450> really<00:00:33.660> easy<00:00:33.750> to

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:34.170 
instructions which are really easy to

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:36.830 
instructions which are really easy to
follow<00:00:34.820> then<00:00:35.820> like<00:00:36.030> always<00:00:36.450> we'll<00:00:36.690> need<00:00:36.780> a

00:00:36.830 --> 00:00:36.840 
follow then like always we'll need a

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:39.200 
follow then like always we'll need a
base<00:00:37.079> and<00:00:37.350> topcoat<00:00:37.770> the<00:00:38.250> instructions<00:00:38.940> don't

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:39.210 
base and topcoat the instructions don't

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:41.119 
base and topcoat the instructions don't
say<00:00:39.420> that<00:00:39.600> this<00:00:39.780> is<00:00:39.930> necessary<00:00:40.530> to<00:00:40.620> apply<00:00:41.070> the

00:00:41.119 --> 00:00:41.129 
say that this is necessary to apply the

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:43.220 
say that this is necessary to apply the
strips<00:00:41.550> but<00:00:41.850> I<00:00:42.030> find<00:00:42.329> it<00:00:42.480> helps<00:00:42.690> them<00:00:42.840> stay<00:00:43.110> on

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:43.230 
strips but I find it helps them stay on

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:46.069 
strips but I find it helps them stay on
longer<00:00:43.520> first<00:00:44.520> step<00:00:44.820> in<00:00:45.030> preparation<00:00:45.719> for<00:00:45.750> the

00:00:46.069 --> 00:00:46.079 
longer first step in preparation for the

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:47.900 
longer first step in preparation for the
application<00:00:46.800> we're<00:00:46.980> gonna<00:00:47.100> open<00:00:47.340> up<00:00:47.610> one

00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:47.910 
application we're gonna open up one

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:51.709 
application we're gonna open up one
package<00:00:48.420> and<00:00:48.629> just<00:00:49.230> size<00:00:49.739> out<00:00:50.039> which<00:00:50.719> fingers

00:00:51.709 --> 00:00:51.719 
package and just size out which fingers

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:53.990 
package and just size out which fingers
the<00:00:51.989> strip's<00:00:52.289> will<00:00:52.500> fit<00:00:52.829> on<00:00:52.949> each<00:00:53.520> package

00:00:53.990 --> 00:00:54.000 
the strip's will fit on each package

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:55.369 
the strip's will fit on each package
come<00:00:54.270> so<00:00:54.510> it's<00:00:54.629> eight<00:00:54.840> so<00:00:55.110> you'll<00:00:55.260> have

00:00:55.369 --> 00:00:55.379 
come so it's eight so you'll have

00:00:55.379 --> 00:00:57.350 
come so it's eight so you'll have
sixteen<00:00:55.949> total<00:00:56.190> so<00:00:56.579> obviously<00:00:57.059> you<00:00:57.210> won't

00:00:57.350 --> 00:00:57.360 
sixteen total so obviously you won't

00:00:57.360 --> 00:00:59.479 
sixteen total so obviously you won't
need<00:00:57.570> all<00:00:57.600> of<00:00:57.809> them<00:00:58.079> so<00:00:58.680> just<00:00:58.920> pick<00:00:59.160> and<00:00:59.340> choose

00:00:59.479 --> 00:00:59.489 
need all of them so just pick and choose

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:03.200 
need all of them so just pick and choose
which<00:00:59.760> ones<00:00:59.789> fit<00:01:00.359> your<00:01:00.510> nails<00:01:00.719> best<00:01:02.090> you<00:01:03.090> have
