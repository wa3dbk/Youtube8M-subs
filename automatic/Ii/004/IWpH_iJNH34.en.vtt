00:00:08.030 --> 00:00:08.040 
those home improvement television shows

00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:09.890 
those home improvement television shows
the<00:00:08.760> ones<00:00:08.970> where<00:00:09.150> they<00:00:09.240> show<00:00:09.420> you<00:00:09.480> how<00:00:09.570> easy

00:00:09.890 --> 00:00:09.900 
the ones where they show you how easy

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:12.680 
the ones where they show you how easy
things<00:00:10.200> are<00:00:10.440> to<00:00:10.590> do<00:00:10.740> especially<00:00:11.690> plumbing

00:00:12.680 --> 00:00:12.690 
things are to do especially plumbing

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:14.750 
things are to do especially plumbing
well<00:00:12.990> that<00:00:13.440> may<00:00:13.680> not<00:00:13.830> be<00:00:14.010> the<00:00:14.130> case<00:00:14.370> especially

00:00:14.750 --> 00:00:14.760 
well that may not be the case especially

00:00:14.760 --> 00:00:17.150 
well that may not be the case especially
when<00:00:15.180> you're<00:00:15.330> working<00:00:15.480> with<00:00:15.660> PVC<00:00:16.170> it's<00:00:16.890> just

00:00:17.150 --> 00:00:17.160 
when you're working with PVC it's just

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:19.099 
when you're working with PVC it's just
not<00:00:17.339> as<00:00:17.460> simple<00:00:17.669> as<00:00:17.999> gluing<00:00:18.779> them<00:00:18.900> together

00:00:19.099 --> 00:00:19.109 
not as simple as gluing them together

00:00:19.109 --> 00:00:20.989 
not as simple as gluing them together
there's<00:00:19.589> some<00:00:19.740> things<00:00:19.980> you<00:00:20.070> need<00:00:20.099> to<00:00:20.310> know<00:00:20.490> to

00:00:20.989 --> 00:00:20.999 
there's some things you need to know to

00:00:20.999 --> 00:00:22.970 
there's some things you need to know to
make<00:00:21.179> sure<00:00:21.329> each<00:00:21.660> and<00:00:21.779> every<00:00:21.990> joint<00:00:22.320> you<00:00:22.650> do

00:00:22.970 --> 00:00:22.980 
make sure each and every joint you do

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:25.999 
make sure each and every joint you do
will<00:00:23.310> indeed<00:00:23.789> be<00:00:24.029> leak<00:00:24.419> proof<00:00:24.659> for<00:00:25.470> example

00:00:25.999 --> 00:00:26.009 
will indeed be leak proof for example

00:00:26.009 --> 00:00:27.979 
will indeed be leak proof for example
did<00:00:26.460> you<00:00:26.490> know<00:00:26.640> that<00:00:27.089> the<00:00:27.210> fittings<00:00:27.659> that<00:00:27.869> you

00:00:27.979 --> 00:00:27.989 
did you know that the fittings that you

00:00:27.989 --> 00:00:30.470 
did you know that the fittings that you
work<00:00:28.230> with<00:00:28.439> are<00:00:28.679> not<00:00:28.939> completely<00:00:29.939> symmetrical

00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:30.480 
work with are not completely symmetrical

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:32.840 
work with are not completely symmetrical
now<00:00:31.230> what<00:00:31.380> I<00:00:31.409> mean<00:00:31.679> by<00:00:31.739> that<00:00:32.070> is<00:00:32.310> that<00:00:32.700> they're

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:32.850 
now what I mean by that is that they're

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:35.360 
now what I mean by that is that they're
actually<00:00:33.060> wider<00:00:33.660> at<00:00:33.989> the<00:00:34.050> top<00:00:34.170> than<00:00:34.440> they<00:00:35.160> are

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:35.370 
actually wider at the top than they are

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:37.760 
actually wider at the top than they are
at<00:00:35.789> the<00:00:35.940> bottom<00:00:36.149> of<00:00:36.420> the<00:00:36.539> socket<00:00:37.050> why<00:00:37.559> is<00:00:37.620> that

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:37.770 
at the bottom of the socket why is that

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:39.740 
at the bottom of the socket why is that
well<00:00:38.460> they<00:00:38.609> do<00:00:38.670> that<00:00:38.760> on<00:00:39.059> purpose<00:00:39.090> so<00:00:39.570> that<00:00:39.600> the

00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:39.750 
well they do that on purpose so that the

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:42.290 
well they do that on purpose so that the
pipe<00:00:40.230> really<00:00:40.949> sits<00:00:41.219> tightly<00:00:41.519> when<00:00:42.059> it<00:00:42.180> goes

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:42.300 
pipe really sits tightly when it goes

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:44.420 
pipe really sits tightly when it goes
deep<00:00:42.660> into<00:00:42.930> the<00:00:43.050> joint<00:00:43.320> but<00:00:43.800> that<00:00:43.949> can<00:00:44.100> work<00:00:44.280> to

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:44.430 
deep into the joint but that can work to

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:46.009 
deep into the joint but that can work to
your<00:00:44.460> disadvantage<00:00:45.269> when<00:00:45.420> you<00:00:45.539> glue<00:00:45.750> because

00:00:46.009 --> 00:00:46.019 
your disadvantage when you glue because

00:00:46.019 --> 00:00:48.259 
your disadvantage when you glue because
if<00:00:46.140> you<00:00:46.260> glue<00:00:46.559> and<00:00:46.859> slide<00:00:47.370> the<00:00:47.550> joint<00:00:47.820> on<00:00:48.000> and

00:00:48.259 --> 00:00:48.269 
if you glue and slide the joint on and

00:00:48.269 --> 00:00:50.240 
if you glue and slide the joint on and
turn<00:00:48.660> your<00:00:48.870> head<00:00:49.079> it<00:00:49.379> actually<00:00:49.649> can<00:00:49.920> slide

00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:50.250 
turn your head it actually can slide

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:52.310 
turn your head it actually can slide
back<00:00:50.460> off<00:00:50.730> again<00:00:50.910> don't<00:00:51.719> let<00:00:51.870> that<00:00:51.989> happen<00:00:52.109> to

00:00:52.310 --> 00:00:52.320 
back off again don't let that happen to

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:54.290 
back off again don't let that happen to
you<00:00:52.500> the<00:00:52.949> fittings<00:00:53.339> also<00:00:53.640> have<00:00:53.789> important

00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:54.300 
you the fittings also have important

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:55.639 
you the fittings also have important
markings<00:00:54.660> on<00:00:54.809> them<00:00:54.960> that<00:00:55.050> will<00:00:55.230> help<00:00:55.260> you

00:00:55.639 --> 00:00:55.649 
markings on them that will help you

00:00:55.649 --> 00:00:57.889 
markings on them that will help you
orient<00:00:55.920> the<00:00:56.370> fittings<00:00:56.730> on<00:00:56.969> the<00:00:57.179> pipe<00:00:57.390> for

00:00:57.889 --> 00:00:57.899 
orient the fittings on the pipe for

00:00:57.899 --> 00:00:59.689 
orient the fittings on the pipe for
example<00:00:58.320> look<00:00:58.469> at<00:00:58.530> this<00:00:58.679> number<00:00:58.829> two<00:00:59.129> it<00:00:59.399> tells

00:00:59.689 --> 00:00:59.699 
example look at this number two it tells

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:01.489 
example look at this number two it tells
you<00:00:59.820> it's<00:00:59.969> a<00:00:59.999> two<00:01:00.210> inch<00:01:00.359> fitting<00:01:00.749> that<00:01:01.050> goes<00:01:01.289> on

00:01:01.489 --> 00:01:01.499 
you it's a two inch fitting that goes on

00:01:01.499 --> 00:01:03.799 
you it's a two inch fitting that goes on
two<00:01:01.769> inch<00:01:01.980> PVC<00:01:02.190> pipe<00:01:02.699> but<00:01:03.179> see<00:01:03.390> this<00:01:03.510> little

successfully glue PVC pipe and fittings

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:25.819 
successfully glue PVC pipe and fittings
together<00:01:23.909> you<00:01:24.329> need<00:01:24.509> primer<00:01:24.899> and<00:01:25.200> you<00:01:25.619> need

00:01:25.819 --> 00:01:25.829 
together you need primer and you need

00:01:25.829 --> 00:01:28.340 
together you need primer and you need
cement<00:01:26.250> the<00:01:26.610> PVC<00:01:27.119> primer<00:01:27.329> is<00:01:27.750> really<00:01:28.200> an

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:28.350 
cement the PVC primer is really an

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:30.859 
cement the PVC primer is really an
important<00:01:28.829> step<00:01:29.070> the<00:01:29.310> primer<00:01:29.750> dissolves<00:01:30.750> the

00:01:30.859 --> 00:01:30.869 
important step the primer dissolves the

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:32.300 
important step the primer dissolves the
printing<00:01:31.229> on<00:01:31.350> the<00:01:31.380> pipe<00:01:31.680> so<00:01:31.860> you<00:01:31.920> know<00:01:32.130> that

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:32.310 
printing on the pipe so you know that

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:33.950 
printing on the pipe so you know that
you've<00:01:32.430> primed<00:01:32.729> it<00:01:32.880> and<00:01:33.030> also<00:01:33.210> as<00:01:33.540> the<00:01:33.570> primer

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:33.960 
you've primed it and also as the primer

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:36.530 
you've primed it and also as the primer
dries<00:01:34.350> it<00:01:35.040> will<00:01:35.280> remove<00:01:35.549> the<00:01:35.759> gloss<00:01:36.090> from<00:01:36.360> the

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:36.540 
dries it will remove the gloss from the

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:38.450 
dries it will remove the gloss from the
pipe<00:01:36.750> the<00:01:37.020> process<00:01:37.469> for<00:01:37.649> priming<00:01:37.920> the<00:01:38.189> fitting

pipe the process for priming the fitting

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:40.340
