 refers to the frequency in which the 

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:19.770
 body produces and consumes energy and 

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:22.320

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:24.539
 to a person's metabolism such as 

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:26.220
 the amount of muscle tissue the 

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:29.220
 frequency in which the 

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:31.859
 food genetic issues system 

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:34.079
 digestive stress levels diet 

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:37.260

 can increase your metabolism 

00:00:41.990 --> 00:00:48.530
 1 breakfast many people ignore the 

00:00:46.640 --> 00:00:51.410
 fact that breakfast is the food 

00:00:48.530 --> 00:00:53.900
 most important of the day even if it seems 

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:55.460
 strange people who eat breakfast are 

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:58.190
 thinner than those that do not 

00:00:55.460 --> 00:01:00.470
 they make the metabolism can become more 

00:00:58.190 --> 00:01:02.720
 slow if breakfast is taken at half 

00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:07.550
 tomorrow or if you wait until noon 

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:10.190
 to eat something 2 avoid the sugar 

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:12.710
 sugar allows the body to store 

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:14.420
 fat it is recommended that a person 

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:16.900
 consume foods that help maintain 

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:19.940
 a normal level of blood sugar 

00:01:16.900 --> 00:01:22.070
 I also exercise two or three times at 

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:24.640
 week to have stable the level of 

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:24.640
 blood sugar 

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:29.640
 consume spicy dishes these 

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:35.100
 spicy dishes help increase 

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:37.200
 Metabolism 4 sleep more according to 

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:39.540
 an investigation people who do not 

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:42.090
 get enough sleep are more likely 

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:43.590
 to gain weight also the muscles are 

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:48.000
 regenerate during this time of 

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:51.120
 inactivity 5 take more water 

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:53.760
 water discards toxins from the body 

00:01:51.120 --> 00:01:56.850
 that occur every time the body 

00:01:53.760 --> 00:01:59.250
 Fat burning most functions 

00:01:56.850 --> 00:02:01.380
 of the body requires water and the lack 

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:03.810
 of water in the body makes this one 

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:06.270
 lower your speed in the functions and you 

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:10.259
 produce the undesirable stress as 

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:13.230
 result 6 detoxify the system 

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:15.600
 digestive a clean digestive system and 

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:18.420
 healthy not only helps the body to 

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:20.910
 operate more efficiently also you 

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:22.650
 provides energy in addition to having a 

00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:24.630
 clean digestive system we can 

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:27.390
 take better advantage of the nutrients of the 

00:02:24.630 --> 00:02:30.180
 food a program that I recommend in 

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:33.010
 the theme is that of the doctor susan the 

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:37.510
 which you can find on your right 

00:02:33.010 --> 00:02:40.329
 7 comma plus little is recommended to consume 

00:02:37.510 --> 00:02:43.090
 from 4 to 6 small meals during the day 

00:02:40.329 --> 00:02:47.290
 Allowing 2 to 3 hours to pass between each 

00:02:43.090 --> 00:02:49.329
 18 never skip meals 

00:02:47.290 --> 00:02:52.180
 people tend to skip meals 

00:02:49.329 --> 00:02:54.730
 hoping to lose weight so 

00:02:52.180 --> 00:02:56.620
 which is a big mistake since this makes 

00:02:54.730 --> 00:02:58.890
 that the metabolism becomes even more 

00:02:56.620 --> 00:03:01.680
 slow 

00:02:58.890 --> 00:03:04.079
 meal plans in detail 

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:08.430
 always prepare the exact amount of 

00:03:04.079 --> 00:03:12.329
 food that will consume 10 get rid of 

00:03:08.430 --> 00:03:14.430
 stress whether physical or emotional this 

00:03:12.329 --> 00:03:16.819
 it tends to release a steroid called 

00:03:14.430 --> 00:03:19.590
 cortisol which affects the metabolism 

00:03:16.819 --> 00:03:22.410
 It is also proven that people 

00:03:19.590 --> 00:03:26.880
 they eat more when they are stressed 

00:03:22.410 --> 00:03:29.700
 11 consume green tea can be used as 

00:03:26.880 --> 00:03:31.710
 coffee substitute green tea has the 

00:03:29.700 --> 00:03:33.960
 ability to stimulate metabolism and 

00:03:31.710 --> 00:03:35.400
 unlike coffee has no effect 

00:03:33.960 --> 00:03:37.860
 side effects when taken with 

00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:41.130
 frequency during the day 

00:03:37.860 --> 00:03:44.420
 12 included more meals that give energy 

00:03:41.130 --> 00:03:47.600
 in your diet such as vegetable fruits 

00:03:44.420 --> 00:03:50.690
 beans and whole foods 

00:03:47.600 --> 00:03:53.330
 Obtaining the desired body is not something 

00:03:50.690 --> 00:03:55.010
 impossible if you have the determination and 

00:03:53.330 --> 00:03:57.860
 patience needed to stabilize 

00:03:55.010 --> 00:03:59.810
 our metabolism which plays a 

00:03:57.860 --> 00:04:02.870
 very important role in the loss of 

00:03:59.810 --> 00:04:05.690
 weight people need to realize 

00:04:02.870 --> 00:04:08.750
 that eating well and exercising is 

00:04:05.690 --> 00:04:11.270
 a lifestyle and not a luxury the 

00:04:08.750 --> 00:04:13.610
 resist cravings is very difficult 

00:04:11.270 --> 00:04:16.250
 for many of us something great 

00:04:13.610 --> 00:04:18.380
 help and what I recommend is usually the 

00:04:16.250 --> 00:04:20.510
 Doctor's program susan good a cost 

00:04:18.380 --> 00:04:23.200
