then also to keeping yourself going in
the<00:01:34.880> correct<00:01:35.210> direction<00:01:35.270> so<00:01:35.929> you<00:01:35.990> use<00:01:36.259> it<00:01:36.410> for

00:01:36.609 --> 00:01:36.619 
the correct direction so you use it for

00:01:36.619 --> 00:01:39.279 
the correct direction so you use it for
steering<00:01:36.860> as<00:01:37.100> well<00:01:37.280> a<00:01:37.550> wave<00:01:38.330> it's<00:01:38.840> much<00:01:39.080> more

00:01:39.279 --> 00:01:39.289 
steering as well a wave it's much more

00:01:39.289 --> 00:01:41.380 
steering as well a wave it's much more
like<00:01:39.530> classic<00:01:40.100> surfing<00:01:40.580> but<00:01:40.940> the<00:01:41.030> paddle

00:01:41.380 --> 00:01:41.390 
like classic surfing but the paddle

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:42.760 
like classic surfing but the paddle
offers<00:01:41.810> a<00:01:41.899> lot<00:01:42.080> of<00:01:42.110> different<00:01:42.560> advantages

00:01:42.760 --> 00:01:42.770 
offers a lot of different advantages

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:44.560 
offers a lot of different advantages
that<00:01:43.160> you<00:01:43.460> don't<00:01:43.640> have<00:01:43.850> in<00:01:43.910> traditional

00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:44.570 
that you don't have in traditional

00:01:44.570 --> 00:01:47.320 
that you don't have in traditional
surface<00:01:45.130> whereas<00:01:46.130> you<00:01:46.340> can<00:01:46.520> lean<00:01:46.700> much<00:01:46.940> harder

00:01:47.320 --> 00:01:47.330 
surface whereas you can lean much harder

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:49.330 
surface whereas you can lean much harder
on<00:01:47.479> the<00:01:47.630> paddle<00:01:48.080> then<00:01:48.500> you<00:01:48.679> could<00:01:48.950> on<00:01:49.280> a

00:01:49.330 --> 00:01:49.340 
on the paddle then you could on a

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:51.760 
on the paddle then you could on a
regular<00:01:49.729> surfboard<00:01:50.570> so<00:01:51.289> that's<00:01:51.500> a<00:01:51.590> big

00:01:51.760 --> 00:01:51.770 
regular surfboard so that's a big

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:53.499 
regular surfboard so that's a big
advantage<00:01:51.920> because<00:01:52.729> we're<00:01:53.030> talking<00:01:53.390> about

00:01:53.499 --> 00:01:53.509 
advantage because we're talking about

00:01:53.509 --> 00:01:55.899 
advantage because we're talking about
typically<00:01:54.170> larger<00:01:54.649> board<00:01:54.950> and<00:01:55.280> to<00:01:55.700> make<00:01:55.880> a

00:01:55.899 --> 00:01:55.909 
typically larger board and to make a

00:01:55.909 --> 00:01:57.730 
typically larger board and to make a
board<00:01:56.210> of<00:01:56.300> that<00:01:56.420> size<00:01:56.720> move<00:01:57.170> and<00:01:57.590> a

00:01:57.730 --> 00:01:57.740 
board of that size move and a

00:01:57.740 --> 00:01:59.889 
board of that size move and a
progressive<00:01:58.340> pronounced<00:01:58.850> manner<00:01:59.119> you<00:01:59.720> need

00:01:59.889 --> 00:01:59.899 
progressive pronounced manner you need

00:01:59.899 --> 00:02:01.479 
progressive pronounced manner you need
something<00:02:00.380> for<00:02:00.560> a<00:02:00.619> little<00:02:00.800> bit<00:02:01.009> of<00:02:01.160> assistance

00:02:01.479 --> 00:02:01.489 
something for a little bit of assistance

00:02:01.489 --> 00:02:03.580 
something for a little bit of assistance
