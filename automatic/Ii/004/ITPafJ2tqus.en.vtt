00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:20.230 
and there's not so much at stake in a
different<00:02:19.310> way<00:02:19.460> you<00:02:19.880> know<00:02:19.910> but<00:02:20.150> I<00:02:20.210> think

00:02:20.230 --> 00:02:20.240 
different way you know but I think

00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:22.060 
different way you know but I think
mostly<00:02:20.720> is<00:02:20.900> the<00:02:21.020> artistic<00:02:21.290> freedom<00:02:21.650> because

00:02:22.060 --> 00:02:22.070 
mostly is the artistic freedom because

00:02:22.070 --> 00:02:24.160 
mostly is the artistic freedom because
you<00:02:22.430> can<00:02:22.580> really<00:02:22.760> do<00:02:22.910> whatever<00:02:23.180> you<00:02:23.330> want<00:02:23.600> in<00:02:23.870> a
