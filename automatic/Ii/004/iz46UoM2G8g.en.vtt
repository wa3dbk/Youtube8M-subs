00:02:00.580 --> 00:02:03.180 
around the southern part of the Rockies
and<00:02:00.610> I<00:02:01.000> find<00:02:01.450> that<00:02:01.630> now<00:02:01.870> with<00:02:02.590> the<00:02:02.770> Eclipse

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:03.190 
and I find that now with the Eclipse

00:02:03.190 --> 00:02:06.060 
and I find that now with the Eclipse
that<00:02:04.060> those<00:02:04.330> worries<00:02:05.050> a<00:02:05.080> lot<00:02:05.650> of<00:02:05.830> them<00:02:05.950> are

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:06.070 
that those worries a lot of them are

00:02:06.070 --> 00:02:08.279 
that those worries a lot of them are
just<00:02:06.880> gone<00:02:07.090> I<00:02:07.450> mean<00:02:07.480> the<00:02:07.690> aircraft<00:02:08.020> is<00:02:08.140> so

00:02:08.279 --> 00:02:08.289 
just gone I mean the aircraft is so

00:02:08.289 --> 00:02:10.859 
just gone I mean the aircraft is so
capable<00:02:08.590> in<00:02:09.099> terms<00:02:09.640> of<00:02:09.879> handling<00:02:10.450> weather

00:02:10.859 --> 00:02:10.869
