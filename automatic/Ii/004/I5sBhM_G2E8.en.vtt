00:00:01.580 --> 00:00:05.500
 here 

00:00:03.020 --> 00:00:05.500
 ah 

00:00:06.140 --> 00:00:12.340
 hello clippers here you see me saving the 

00:00:09.440 --> 00:00:12.340
 life of some peas 

00:00:16.900 --> 00:00:22.599
 and meanwhile I in the box and me 

00:00:19.840 --> 00:00:24.880
 who gets me good now I leave but 

00:00:22.599 --> 00:00:28.570
 before I will say what I have my box 

00:00:24.880 --> 00:00:31.960
 of unboxing I am the sony xperia z 1 

00:00:28.570 --> 00:00:34.330
 here I have the sony xperia z 1 mother 

00:00:31.960 --> 00:00:36.940
 how is September that of 

00:00:34.330 --> 00:00:38.949
 releases that are new and 

00:00:36.940 --> 00:00:40.629
 example besides having launched the 

00:00:38.949 --> 00:00:42.070
 camera objectives of which we also 

00:00:40.629 --> 00:00:44.769
 we will talk in the corresponding 

00:00:42.070 --> 00:00:47.800
 videogram then launches the ultra zeta 

00:00:44.769 --> 00:00:50.560
 also launches its smart watch 2 but this 

00:00:47.800 --> 00:00:53.380
 is what I have here today 

00:00:50.560 --> 00:00:55.870
 this is the box here we have the team 

00:00:53.380 --> 00:00:57.550
 a clear picture so we know what 

00:00:55.870 --> 00:00:59.650
 is what we are going to find 

00:00:57.550 --> 00:01:01.810
 and a detail the profile in which it is seen 

00:00:59.650 --> 00:01:04.449
 the classic aluminum button already of the 

00:01:01.810 --> 00:01:05.950
 xperia and if we use the return we see the 

00:01:04.449 --> 00:01:08.890
 three colors in which it is available 

00:01:05.950 --> 00:01:10.060
 in this color violet to purple I 

00:01:08.890 --> 00:01:12.370
 either that he understands a lot about 

00:01:10.060 --> 00:01:14.830
 colors such true you have said the 

00:01:12.370 --> 00:01:16.780
 white and black and then some of the 

00:01:14.830 --> 00:01:19.840
 technical characteristics of course 

00:01:16.780 --> 00:01:23.560
 that has android also that has 

00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:27.130
 a sensor to hold on all of 20 7 

00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:28.990
 megapixels but here the important thing is not 

00:01:27.130 --> 00:01:31.390
 it's only in the resolution but 

00:01:28.990 --> 00:01:33.490
 besides having the processor the 

00:01:31.390 --> 00:01:35.860
 smartphone on the one hand has a 

00:01:33.490 --> 00:01:40.730
 independent processor that is for the 

00:01:35.860 --> 00:01:44.350
 camera this is the bionz processor 

00:01:40.730 --> 00:01:44.350
 come let's open it 

00:01:46.270 --> 00:01:52.890
 here is good plastic 

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:56.160
 I'll leave it here and let's see what 

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:59.270
 there's more in the box then cardboard over here 

00:01:56.160 --> 00:02:00.859
 we have the charger 

00:01:59.270 --> 00:02:04.240
 the charger that goes to the current 

00:02:00.859 --> 00:02:04.240
 electric of course 

00:02:04.980 --> 00:02:10.590
 that has a lot of plastic sony 

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:12.870
 this is the european and that will go 

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:16.800
 accompanied with this cable which is the 

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:19.380
 usb micro usb cable the truth is that the 

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:22.590
 news would be that I did not wear it 

00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:25.500
 but it is clear as all usb cable 

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:28.400
 micro usb but that is what takes us 

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:28.400
 does not wear headphones 

00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:32.580
 but it takes a lot of papers but 

00:02:30.989 --> 00:02:35.180
 let's go for the smartphone which is what 

00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:35.180
 we are interested 

00:02:35.870 --> 00:02:38.739
 so we have it 

00:02:41.510 --> 00:02:46.310
 and remove the plastic front for 

00:02:43.879 --> 00:02:49.069
 uncover your screen 5 

00:02:46.310 --> 00:02:51.260
 inch that has a full resolution 

00:02:49.069 --> 00:02:53.569
 hd and bright tree technology that 

00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:56.810
 This technology is what it is because 

00:02:53.569 --> 00:02:58.489
 to improve the range of colors is 

00:02:56.810 --> 00:03:01.069
 say how many colors it is 

00:02:58.489 --> 00:03:03.079
 able to show the screen in this 

00:03:01.069 --> 00:03:05.090
 case for example three luminous makes 

00:03:03.079 --> 00:03:06.799
 that the red colors look better and 

00:03:05.090 --> 00:03:08.000
 green and that we turn around before 

00:03:06.799 --> 00:03:10.129
 remove the plastic we see that in the 

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:11.900
 plastic there are companies a series of 

00:03:10.129 --> 00:03:14.000
 instructions that would suit 

00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:16.370
 supposed to see them before removing it here 

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:18.739
 up there is a little symbol where he says 

00:03:16.370 --> 00:03:21.019
 do not insert a screwdriver 

00:03:18.739 --> 00:03:23.359
 slot here because if there's one here 

00:03:21.019 --> 00:03:25.459
 slot that is that I already know that you are about 

00:03:23.359 --> 00:03:26.750
 false letters and clear as soon as you see a 

00:03:25.459 --> 00:03:28.069
 network one says know what's below that 

00:03:26.750 --> 00:03:30.109
 there is below then here if there is the 

00:03:28.069 --> 00:03:33.109
 what is below surely or you want it 

00:03:30.109 --> 00:03:35.269
 What else is here, here is 

00:03:33.109 --> 00:03:37.099
 indications of how to put the card 

00:03:35.269 --> 00:03:38.870
 microsim that you have to take out then a 

00:03:37.099 --> 00:03:41.569
 kind of adapter but once you already 

00:03:38.870 --> 00:03:45.170
 we have seen this let's remove it 

00:03:41.569 --> 00:03:47.870
 glass glass in front and glass by 

00:03:45.170 --> 00:03:49.659
 that's why you do not have to put the 

00:03:47.870 --> 00:03:53.349
 screwdriver that I'm telling you 

00:03:49.659 --> 00:03:56.989
 symbol of nfc because it has nfc 

00:03:53.349 --> 00:04:00.469
 here we have the led flash and here we have 

00:03:56.989 --> 00:04:02.870
 the camera with lenses and in fact it's more 

00:04:00.469 --> 00:04:04.400
 not only indicates the amount of 

00:04:02.870 --> 00:04:05.810
 megapixels it has but it does 

00:04:04.400 --> 00:04:07.340
 We also strongly emphasize the size of the 

00:04:05.810 --> 00:04:09.859
 sensor because of the size of the sensor 

00:04:07.340 --> 00:04:12.079
 it is important the size matters how much 

00:04:09.859 --> 00:04:14.540
 bigger better better captures light and 

00:04:12.079 --> 00:04:16.549
 our images are better so 

00:04:14.540 --> 00:04:19.880
 here we have a sensor size 1 

00:04:16.549 --> 00:04:21.410
 match 2,3 this could be the sensor 

00:04:19.880 --> 00:04:23.180
 that they would use for example the 

00:04:21.410 --> 00:04:24.710
 compact cameras a compact camera 

00:04:23.180 --> 00:04:27.289
 normal and it's not talking about a 

00:04:24.710 --> 00:04:29.660
 premium plan sony x 100 that has 

00:04:27.289 --> 00:04:31.820
 largest sensor for example would be the 

00:04:29.660 --> 00:04:33.620
 same sensor that has the galaxy camera 

00:04:31.820 --> 00:04:35.030
 to give you an idea, we are going to 

00:04:33.620 --> 00:04:38.449
 take a look at the laterals know 

00:04:35.030 --> 00:04:40.510
 So, here is a little cap uy 

00:04:38.449 --> 00:04:42.430
 who took it off 

00:04:40.510 --> 00:04:44.470
 it uncovers the adapter 

00:04:42.430 --> 00:04:47.140
 to put the microsim card that is 

00:04:44.470 --> 00:04:49.660
 this adapter here we have the button 

00:04:47.140 --> 00:04:53.590
 hesperia aluminum here we have the 

00:04:49.660 --> 00:04:55.420
 Volume control and camera button 

00:04:53.590 --> 00:04:57.670
 the camera button that they have recovered 

00:04:55.420 --> 00:04:58.780
 because in hesperia z they had 

00:04:57.670 --> 00:05:00.130
 taken away and the truth that a 

00:04:58.780 --> 00:05:01.660
 little bit of everything especially if you wanted 

00:05:00.130 --> 00:05:03.430
 take a picture like that suddenly under the 

00:05:01.660 --> 00:05:05.200
 water this is much more comfortable because 

00:05:03.430 --> 00:05:06.730
 you know that touch screens with 

00:05:05.200 --> 00:05:08.230
 the water does not get along especially well 

00:05:06.730 --> 00:05:11.080
 what more things do you have out here 

00:05:08.230 --> 00:05:13.240
 we have speakers over here we have a few 

00:05:11.080 --> 00:05:17.840
 connectors that will be used to use it 

00:05:13.240 --> 00:05:20.600
 with dokins and here we have some caps 

00:05:17.840 --> 00:05:23.630
 these caps expose the 

00:05:20.600 --> 00:05:26.690
 microusb connection and the slot for 

00:05:23.630 --> 00:05:29.270
 microsd cards and in this part of here 

00:05:26.690 --> 00:05:30.770
 we have the good minijack connector already 

00:05:29.270 --> 00:05:32.780
 you know imagined that when you were 

00:05:30.770 --> 00:05:34.910
 saying when I was submerging is the 

00:05:32.780 --> 00:05:37.850
 phone underwater the photos and such is 

00:05:34.910 --> 00:05:40.360
 that the xperia z1 is also submersible and 

00:05:37.850 --> 00:05:43.010
 it admits splashes etcetera etcetera 

00:05:40.360 --> 00:05:46.160
 how is it possible that I have the mini jack 

00:05:43.010 --> 00:05:48.380
 uncovered because it is hydrophobic 

00:05:46.160 --> 00:05:49.610
 that is, it does not let the water pass or 

00:05:48.380 --> 00:05:51.979
 dry you can put the headphones 

00:05:49.610 --> 00:05:55.190
 perfectly and it's a pretty solution 

00:05:51.979 --> 00:05:56.990
 More elegant than the solution to remove 

00:05:55.190 --> 00:05:58.580
 the cap insert the headphones and 

00:05:56.990 --> 00:06:01.310
 the cap was hanging and it was a bit 

00:05:58.580 --> 00:06:03.530
 ugly that way it's very rich and while 

00:06:01.310 --> 00:06:06.800
 I light the z1 I tell you that inside 

00:06:03.530 --> 00:06:09.919
 It has a quad-core processor to 22 

00:06:06.800 --> 00:06:11.630
 gigahertz and a ram of 2 gb the 

00:06:09.919 --> 00:06:16.160
 Internal storage capacity is 

00:06:11.630 --> 00:06:18.320
 16 GB expandable by cards 

00:06:16.160 --> 00:06:21.919
 microsd that I taught you before until 

00:06:18.320 --> 00:06:23.479
 64 gb by the way the screen has 

00:06:21.919 --> 00:06:24.400
 a density of pixels per inch 

00:06:23.479 --> 00:06:28.220
 adequate 

00:06:24.400 --> 00:06:30.170
 141 Let's see that the battery looks great 

00:06:28.220 --> 00:06:31.970
 is 3000 milliamps and we'll see 

00:06:30.170 --> 00:06:34.070
 how do you respond though I can go 

00:06:31.970 --> 00:06:36.590
 advancing that in the tests that I have 

00:06:34.070 --> 00:06:37.520
 could not do with another team is not 

00:06:36.590 --> 00:06:40.700
 because this one was completely 

00:06:37.520 --> 00:06:42.890
 presented as he has responded quite 

00:06:40.700 --> 00:06:45.290
 quite pretty well very much better 

00:06:42.890 --> 00:06:46.730
 that the hesperia z and the truth is that 

00:06:45.290 --> 00:06:48.020
 above the average of smartphones 

00:06:46.730 --> 00:06:49.520
 that right now in the market and for 

00:06:48.020 --> 00:06:51.110
 Certain other thing that we mentioned before 

00:06:49.520 --> 00:06:52.850
 when they talked about design and everything 

00:06:51.110 --> 00:06:55.760
 what the laterals had is that their 

00:06:52.850 --> 00:06:58.490
 omni balance design is now different 

00:06:55.760 --> 00:07:00.660
 that hesperia zy is that he has a 

00:06:58.490 --> 00:07:03.360
 aluminium frame 

00:07:00.660 --> 00:07:09.400
 which is combined with the video part its 

00:07:03.360 --> 00:07:13.350
 price is 689 euros and do not miss 

00:07:09.400 --> 00:07:13.350
 the corresponding diagram 

00:07:13.440 --> 00:07:17.450
 goodbye limits uy
