00:02:59.339 --> 00:02:59.349 

00:02:59.349 --> 00:03:03.309 

so<00:03:00.349> this<00:03:01.310> is<00:03:01.340> basically<00:03:01.610> Surrey<00:03:02.480> at<00:03:02.959> its<00:03:03.170> best

00:03:03.309 --> 00:03:03.319 
so this is basically Surrey at its best

00:03:03.319 --> 00:03:05.199 
so this is basically Surrey at its best
I<00:03:03.530> mean<00:03:03.650> simple<00:03:03.980> things<00:03:04.040> it'll<00:03:04.430> work<00:03:04.640> basic

00:03:05.199 --> 00:03:05.209 
I mean simple things it'll work basic

00:03:05.209 --> 00:03:09.190 
I mean simple things it'll work basic
tests<00:03:05.660> but<00:03:06.560> kind<00:03:07.190> of<00:03:07.810> questions<00:03:08.810> where<00:03:09.079> you

00:03:09.190 --> 00:03:09.200 
tests but kind of questions where you

00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:11.470 
tests but kind of questions where you
speak<00:03:09.470> more<00:03:09.680> naturally<00:03:10.280> and<00:03:10.760> you<00:03:11.060> know<00:03:11.150> where

00:03:11.470 --> 00:03:11.480 
speak more naturally and you know where

00:03:11.480 --> 00:03:14.170 
speak more naturally and you know where

00:03:41.500 --> 00:03:41.510 
would think over time they're going to

00:03:41.510 --> 00:03:43.750 
would think over time they're going to
build<00:03:41.630> it<00:03:41.840> i<00:03:42.019> mean<00:03:42.290> because<00:03:42.349> if<00:03:42.590> i<00:03:42.919> was<00:03:43.489> able<00:03:43.639> to

00:03:43.750 --> 00:03:43.760 
build it i mean because if i was able to

00:03:43.760 --> 00:03:45.550 
build it i mean because if i was able to
get<00:03:43.849> these<00:03:43.970> stupid<00:03:44.389> answers<00:03:44.750> right<00:03:45.319> now<00:03:45.380> i

00:03:45.550 --> 00:03:45.560 
get these stupid answers right now i

00:03:45.560 --> 00:03:47.229 
get these stupid answers right now i
meant<00:03:46.040> that<00:03:46.220> they<00:03:46.340> probably<00:03:46.579> thought<00:03:46.940> about

00:03:47.229 --> 00:03:47.239 
meant that they probably thought about

00:03:47.239 --> 00:03:50.050 
meant that they probably thought about
it<00:03:47.480> just<00:03:47.750> they<00:03:47.989> didn't<00:03:48.579> program<00:03:49.579> it<00:03:49.940> in

00:03:50.050 --> 00:03:50.060 
it just they didn't program it in

00:03:50.060 --> 00:03:52.180 
it just they didn't program it in
actually<00:03:50.419> on<00:03:50.569> how<00:03:50.750> to<00:03:50.810> answer<00:03:51.049> so<00:03:51.560> over<00:03:51.919> time

00:03:52.180 --> 00:03:52.190 
actually on how to answer so over time

00:03:52.190 --> 00:03:56.039 
actually on how to answer so over time
this<00:03:52.910> will<00:03:52.970> definitely<00:03:53.389> get<00:03:53.959> better<00:03:54.200> i'm<00:03:54.380> sure

00:03:56.039 --> 00:03:56.049 
this will definitely get better i'm sure

00:03:56.049 --> 00:03:59.289 
this will definitely get better i'm sure
you<00:03:57.049> know<00:03:57.169> so<00:03:57.560> a<00:03:57.829> pro<00:03:58.190> would<00:03:58.220> be<00:03:58.639> that<00:03:59.090> it's

00:03:59.289 --> 00:03:59.299 
you know so a pro would be that it's

00:03:59.299 --> 00:04:00.849 
you know so a pro would be that it's
just<00:03:59.599> something<00:04:00.049> you<00:04:00.230> know<00:04:00.319> it<00:04:00.500> only<00:04:00.650> took

00:04:00.849 --> 00:04:00.859 
just something you know it only took

00:04:00.859 --> 00:04:02.349 
just something you know it only took
them<00:04:01.010> eight<00:04:01.160> hours<00:04:01.430> to<00:04:01.519> develop<00:04:01.970> and<00:04:02.180> it's

00:04:02.349 --> 00:04:02.359 
them eight hours to develop and it's

00:04:02.359 --> 00:04:03.970 
them eight hours to develop and it's
it's<00:04:03.139> not<00:04:03.260> the<00:04:03.380> worst<00:04:03.590> thing<00:04:03.709> in<00:04:03.889> the<00:04:03.950> world

00:04:03.970 --> 00:04:03.980 
it's not the worst thing in the world

00:04:03.980 --> 00:04:05.710 
it's not the worst thing in the world
that<00:04:04.250> common<00:04:04.730> would<00:04:04.819> be<00:04:04.940> that<00:04:05.150> you<00:04:05.359> could<00:04:05.510> tell

00:04:05.710 --> 00:04:05.720 
that common would be that you could tell

00:04:05.720 --> 00:04:07.539 
that common would be that you could tell
it<00:04:05.959> only<00:04:06.230> took<00:04:06.440> eight<00:04:06.620> hours<00:04:06.919> to<00:04:07.040> develop<00:04:07.400> and

00:04:07.539 --> 00:04:07.549 
it only took eight hours to develop and

00:04:07.549 --> 00:04:09.699 
it only took eight hours to develop and
you<00:04:08.359> know<00:04:08.480> in<00:04:08.690> certain<00:04:08.870> sense<00:04:09.260> is<00:04:09.380> because<00:04:09.410> it

00:04:09.699 --> 00:04:09.709 
you know in certain sense is because it

00:04:09.709 --> 00:04:12.659 
you know in certain sense is because it
can't<00:04:09.919> answer<00:04:10.130> certain<00:04:11.030> specific<00:04:11.569> questions

00:04:12.659 --> 00:04:12.669 
can't answer certain specific questions

00:04:12.669 --> 00:04:15.550 
can't answer certain specific questions
overall<00:04:13.669> I'd<00:04:13.849> give<00:04:13.880> it<00:04:14.090> a<00:04:14.389> four<00:04:15.019> for<00:04:15.230> effort

00:04:15.550 --> 00:04:15.560 
overall I'd give it a four for effort

00:04:15.560 --> 00:04:17.300 
overall I'd give it a four for effort
just<00:04:15.799> because<00:04:16.250> of
