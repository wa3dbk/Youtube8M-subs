well saying as I really just made a deck
on<00:05:12.690> a<00:05:12.840> whim<00:05:13.050> and<00:05:13.289> I<00:05:14.210> played<00:05:15.210> it<00:05:15.360> a<00:05:15.389> few<00:05:15.419> times<00:05:15.599> on

00:05:16.040 --> 00:05:16.050 
on a whim and I played it a few times on

00:05:16.050 --> 00:05:18.559 
on a whim and I played it a few times on
during<00:05:16.560> the<00:05:16.650> network<00:05:17.039> and<00:05:17.430> it<00:05:18.030> probably<00:05:18.240> lost

00:05:18.559 --> 00:05:18.569 
during the network and it probably lost

00:05:18.569 --> 00:05:23.360 
during the network and it probably lost
like<00:05:18.840> twice<00:05:20.990> but<00:05:21.990> that<00:05:22.139> was<00:05:22.259> I<00:05:22.530> mainly<00:05:22.889> made<00:05:23.219> it

00:05:23.360 --> 00:05:23.370 
like twice but that was I mainly made it

00:05:23.370 --> 00:05:27.740 
like twice but that was I mainly made it
a<00:05:23.400> week<00:05:23.729> or<00:05:24.060> two<00:05:24.569> ahead<00:05:24.990> of<00:05:25.380> now<00:05:26.479> ahead<00:05:27.479> of<00:05:27.630> the

00:05:27.740 --> 00:05:27.750 
a week or two ahead of now ahead of the

00:05:27.750 --> 00:05:31.809 
a week or two ahead of now ahead of the
tech<00:05:27.990> a<00:05:28.020> head<00:05:28.560> of<00:05:28.680> norcross<00:05:28.979> so<00:05:29.370> I<00:05:29.930> mean<00:05:30.930> I

00:05:31.809 --> 00:05:31.819 
tech a head of norcross so I mean I

00:05:31.819 --> 00:05:34.760 
tech a head of norcross so I mean I
guess<00:05:32.819> I<00:05:33.090> made<00:05:33.240> up<00:05:33.360> some<00:05:33.569> right<00:05:33.750> calls<00:05:34.020> on<00:05:34.319> what

00:05:34.760 --> 00:05:34.770 
guess I made up some right calls on what

00:05:34.770 --> 00:05:41.300 
guess I made up some right calls on what
to<00:05:34.889> play<00:05:36.020> I<00:05:38.599> have<00:05:39.599> a<00:05:39.630> slightly<00:05:40.620> different

00:05:41.300 --> 00:05:41.310 
to play I have a slightly different

00:05:41.310 --> 00:05:45.499 
to play I have a slightly different
version<00:05:41.520> but<00:05:43.909> this<00:05:44.909> was<00:05:45.090> the<00:05:45.180> version<00:05:45.479> that

00:05:45.499 --> 00:05:45.509 
version but this was the version that

00:05:45.509 --> 00:05:52.759 
version but this was the version that
one<00:05:45.750> no<00:05:45.960> across<00:05:46.259> so<00:05:49.759> well
