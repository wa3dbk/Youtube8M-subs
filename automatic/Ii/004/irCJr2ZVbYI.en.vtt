third fret on the d-string so we have
this<00:02:14.050> all<00:02:14.260> together

00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:21.030 

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:34.910 

startled

00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:34.920 

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:37.520 

now<00:02:35.910> when<00:02:36.150> you<00:02:36.210> play<00:02:36.330> this<00:02:36.569> at<00:02:36.870> the<00:02:37.050> very<00:02:37.230> right

00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:37.530 
now when you play this at the very right

00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:39.559 
now when you play this at the very right
before<00:02:37.860> the<00:02:37.980> very<00:02:38.190> last<00:02:38.430> chorus<00:02:38.940> he<00:02:39.450> has<00:02:39.540> a

00:02:39.559 --> 00:02:39.569 
before the very last chorus he has a

00:02:39.569 --> 00:02:41.270 
before the very last chorus he has a
slight<00:02:39.900> variation<00:02:40.560> on<00:02:40.680> it<00:02:40.709> I<00:02:40.860> think<00:02:41.100> he<00:02:41.160> does

00:02:41.270 --> 00:02:41.280 
slight variation on it I think he does

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:42.770 
slight variation on it I think he does
it<00:02:41.370> one<00:02:41.490> more<00:02:41.610> time<00:02:41.730> within<00:02:41.970> the<00:02:42.120> song<00:02:42.330> too<00:02:42.600> so

00:02:42.770 --> 00:02:42.780 
it one more time within the song too so

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:44.480 
it one more time within the song too so
just<00:02:42.930> listen<00:02:43.170> not<00:02:43.260> for<00:02:43.410> this<00:02:43.470> part<00:02:43.740> it<00:02:44.190> sounds

00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:44.490 
just listen not for this part it sounds

00:02:44.490 --> 00:02:48.920 
just listen not for this part it sounds
like<00:02:44.580> this

00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:48.930 

00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:51.080 

all<00:02:49.620> right<00:02:49.739> so<00:02:49.920> basically<00:02:50.069> he<00:02:50.579> just<00:02:50.609> kind<00:02:51.030> of

00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:51.090 
all right so basically he just kind of

00:02:51.090 --> 00:02:53.000 
all right so basically he just kind of
held<00:02:51.659> him<00:02:51.780> that<00:02:51.930> third<00:02:52.170> fret<00:02:52.650> a<00:02:52.680> little<00:02:52.920> bit

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:53.010 
held him that third fret a little bit

00:02:53.010 --> 00:02:59.220 
held him that third fret a little bit
there<00:02:53.129> so<00:02:53.310> at<00:02:53.489> the<00:02:53.579> very<00:02:53.790> end

00:02:59.220 --> 00:02:59.230 

00:02:59.230 --> 00:03:00.720 

so<00:02:59.800> you<00:02:59.860> just<00:02:59.980> pick<00:03:00.099> up<00:03:00.160> that<00:03:00.250> bird<00:03:00.459> friend

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:00.730 
so you just pick up that bird friend

00:03:00.730 --> 00:03:02.910 
so you just pick up that bird friend
again<00:03:00.970> and<00:03:01.630> then<00:03:02.080> hammering<00:03:02.380> on<00:03:02.530> three<00:03:02.860> to

00:03:02.910 --> 00:03:02.920 
again and then hammering on three to
