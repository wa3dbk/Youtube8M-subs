you the epson workforce alm 300 series
this<00:00:11.070> is<00:00:11.309> the<00:00:11.610> fully<00:00:11.790> configured<00:00:12.209> DTN<00:00:12.749> model

00:00:13.039 --> 00:00:13.049 
this is the fully configured DTN model

00:00:13.049 --> 00:00:15.680 
this is the fully configured DTN model
that<00:00:13.139> we<00:00:13.230> have<00:00:13.410> here<00:00:13.650> but<00:00:14.339> you<00:00:14.759> can<00:00:15.059> also<00:00:15.299> go

00:00:15.680 --> 00:00:15.690 
that we have here but you can also go

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:19.400 
that we have here but you can also go
for<00:00:15.900> the<00:00:16.049> D<00:00:16.470> or<00:00:16.770> the<00:00:16.830> DN<00:00:17.780> the<00:00:18.780> difference<00:00:19.230> would

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:19.410 
for the D or the DN the difference would

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:20.810 
for the D or the DN the difference would
be<00:00:19.470> that<00:00:19.620> you<00:00:19.830> won't<00:00:20.040> have<00:00:20.250> this<00:00:20.430> additional

00:00:20.810 --> 00:00:20.820 
be that you won't have this additional

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:23.030 
be that you won't have this additional
tray<00:00:21.300> and<00:00:21.570> if<00:00:21.630> you<00:00:21.690> go<00:00:21.810> for<00:00:22.050> the<00:00:22.110> D<00:00:22.350> you'll<00:00:22.860> also

00:00:23.030 --> 00:00:23.040 
tray and if you go for the D you'll also

00:00:23.040 --> 00:00:25.910 
tray and if you go for the D you'll also
not<00:00:23.400> have<00:00:23.610> network<00:00:24.090> capability<00:00:24.840> so<00:00:25.440> first<00:00:25.770> of

00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:25.920 
not have network capability so first of

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:27.620 
not have network capability so first of
all<00:00:26.010> I<00:00:26.040> want<00:00:26.340> to<00:00:26.460> show<00:00:26.610> you<00:00:26.670> how<00:00:27.030> quickly<00:00:27.360> this

00:00:27.620 --> 00:00:27.630 
all I want to show you how quickly this

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:30.680 
all I want to show you how quickly this
machine<00:00:27.990> prints<00:00:28.530> from<00:00:29.100> sleep<00:00:29.580> so<00:00:30.240> here<00:00:30.480> we<00:00:30.570> go

00:00:30.680 --> 00:00:30.690 
machine prints from sleep so here we go

00:00:30.690 --> 00:00:35.329 
machine prints from sleep so here we go
five<00:00:31.050> pages<00:00:33.649> supposedly<00:00:34.649> it's<00:00:34.890> pretty<00:00:35.160> much

00:00:35.329 --> 00:00:35.339 
five pages supposedly it's pretty much

00:00:35.339 --> 00:00:38.119 
five pages supposedly it's pretty much
an<00:00:35.489> instant<00:00:35.699> warm-up<00:00:36.449> fuser<00:00:36.780> so<00:00:37.649> we'll<00:00:37.890> see

00:00:38.119 --> 00:00:38.129 
an instant warm-up fuser so we'll see

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:40.149 
an instant warm-up fuser so we'll see
I'm<00:00:38.640> going<00:00:38.820> to<00:00:38.879> extend<00:00:39.359> the<00:00:39.510> output<00:00:39.870> tray

00:00:40.149 --> 00:00:40.159 
I'm going to extend the output tray

00:00:40.159 --> 00:00:44.989 
I'm going to extend the output tray
while<00:00:41.159> we<00:00:41.309> wait<00:00:42.739> look<00:00:43.739> at<00:00:43.890> that<00:00:44.100> how<00:00:44.280> quick<00:00:44.640> was

00:00:44.989 --> 00:00:44.999 
while we wait look at that how quick was

00:00:44.999 --> 00:00:51.090 
while we wait look at that how quick was
that<00:00:45.059> that<00:00:45.510> was<00:00:45.629> really<00:00:45.899> impressive

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:51.100 

00:00:51.100 --> 00:00:53.200 

and<00:00:52.100> there<00:00:52.280> we<00:00:52.339> go<00:00:52.429> the<00:00:52.550> print<00:00:52.789> quality<00:00:53.000> is

00:00:53.200 --> 00:00:53.210 
and there we go the print quality is

00:00:53.210 --> 00:00:54.990 
and there we go the print quality is
very<00:00:53.390> good<00:00:53.600> as<00:00:53.750> well

00:00:54.990 --> 00:00:55.000 
very good as well

00:00:55.000 --> 00:01:00.099 
very good as well
okay<00:00:56.000> so<00:00:56.469> let's<00:00:57.469> turn<00:00:58.100> the<00:00:58.309> thing<00:00:58.519> off<00:00:59.109> unplug

00:01:00.099 --> 00:01:00.109 
okay so let's turn the thing off unplug

00:01:00.109 --> 00:01:02.110 
okay so let's turn the thing off unplug
the<00:01:00.320> cables<00:01:00.859> and<00:01:01.250> then<00:01:01.460> we<00:01:01.579> can<00:01:01.760> have<00:01:01.909> a<00:01:01.940> look

00:01:02.110 --> 00:01:02.120 
the cables and then we can have a look

00:01:02.120 --> 00:01:04.570 
the cables and then we can have a look
around<00:01:02.329> so<00:01:03.289> first<00:01:03.800> of<00:01:03.979> all<00:01:04.040> let's<00:01:04.250> look<00:01:04.339> at<00:01:04.519> the

00:01:04.570 --> 00:01:04.580 
around so first of all let's look at the

00:01:04.580 --> 00:01:06.190 
around so first of all let's look at the
front<00:01:04.909> so<00:01:05.119> we've<00:01:05.299> got<00:01:05.509> the<00:01:05.750> 50<00:01:06.020> seat

00:01:06.190 --> 00:01:06.200 
front so we've got the 50 seat

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:09.249 
front so we've got the 50 seat
multi-purpose<00:01:06.500> here<00:01:07.100> and<00:01:07.690> you<00:01:08.690> can<00:01:08.990> actually

00:01:09.249 --> 00:01:09.259

00:01:09.259 --> 00:01:12.760 
multi-purpose here and you can actually
load<00:01:09.950> the<00:01:10.340> paper<00:01:10.549> in<00:01:10.880> but<00:01:11.750> you<00:01:11.899> can<00:01:12.440> pull<00:01:12.649> the

00:01:12.760 --> 00:01:12.770 
load the paper in but you can pull the

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:14.230 
load the paper in but you can pull the
whole<00:01:13.039> thing<00:01:13.070> out<00:01:13.520> if<00:01:13.700> you<00:01:13.820> need<00:01:13.970> to<00:01:14.119> adjust

is the 250 sheet tray that you get as

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:25.510 
is the 250 sheet tray that you get as
standard<00:01:22.759> now<00:01:23.300> when<00:01:23.659> you<00:01:23.899> get<00:01:24.200> the<00:01:24.619> DTN<00:01:25.190> model

00:01:25.510 --> 00:01:25.520 
standard now when you get the DTN model

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:27.340 
standard now when you get the DTN model
you<00:01:25.789> will<00:01:26.000> have<00:01:26.210> to<00:01:26.330> add<00:01:26.479> this<00:01:26.750> extra<00:01:26.810> trait

00:01:27.340 --> 00:01:27.350 
you will have to add this extra trait

00:01:29.080 --> 00:01:29.090 
very very easy to do but there are two

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:32.559 
very very easy to do but there are two
screws<00:01:29.649> inside<00:01:30.649> there<00:01:31.220> and<00:01:31.460> once<00:01:32.360> you've

photo conductor unit and the fuser are

00:02:24.349 --> 00:02:27.550 
photo conductor unit and the fuser are
both<00:02:24.560> rated<00:02:24.830> at<00:02:25.099> 100,000<00:02:25.940> pages<00:02:26.180> so<00:02:27.170> you're

00:02:27.550 --> 00:02:27.560 
both rated at 100,000 pages so you're

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:29.830 
both rated at 100,000 pages so you're
not<00:02:27.650> going<00:02:27.769> to<00:02:27.830> be<00:02:27.920> replacing<00:02:28.280> those<00:02:28.840> very

00:02:29.830 --> 00:02:29.840 
not going to be replacing those very

00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:32.860 
not going to be replacing those very
often<00:02:30.080> the<00:02:30.680> toners<00:02:31.160> are<00:02:31.540> something<00:02:32.540> that<00:02:32.690> you

00:02:32.860 --> 00:02:32.870 
often the toners are something that you

00:02:32.870 --> 00:02:34.240 
often the toners are something that you
will<00:02:33.110> be<00:02:33.260> replacing<00:02:33.590> a<00:02:33.769> little<00:02:33.980> bit<00:02:34.099> more

00:02:34.240 --> 00:02:34.250 
will be replacing a little bit more

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:35.800 
will be replacing a little bit more
frequently<00:02:34.790> because<00:02:34.940> they're<00:02:35.239> rated<00:02:35.659> at

00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:35.810

off and lets you add additional memory
here<00:03:06.210> I<00:03:06.860> thought<00:03:07.860> that<00:03:08.010> you'll<00:03:08.130> need<00:03:08.280> to<00:03:08.580> to<00:03:08.760> be

00:03:08.780 --> 00:03:08.790 
here I thought that you'll need to to be

00:03:08.790 --> 00:03:10.970 
here I thought that you'll need to to be
honest<00:03:09.090> with<00:03:09.240> you<00:03:09.330> but<00:03:09.510> it's<00:03:10.380> always<00:03:10.830> an

00:03:10.970 --> 00:03:10.980 
honest with you but it's always an

00:03:10.980 --> 00:03:14.120 
honest with you but it's always an
option<00:03:11.160> if<00:03:11.490> you<00:03:11.700> want<00:03:12.690> to<00:03:13.020> add<00:03:13.200> up<00:03:13.440> to<00:03:13.650> an<00:03:13.860> extra

00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:14.130 
option if you want to add up to an extra

00:03:14.130 --> 00:03:17.840 
option if you want to add up to an extra
gig<00:03:14.340> of<00:03:14.460> memory<00:03:15.320> ok<00:03:16.320> so<00:03:16.380> at<00:03:16.980> the<00:03:17.190> back<00:03:17.400> we've

00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:17.850 
gig of memory ok so at the back we've

00:03:17.850 --> 00:03:19.940 
gig of memory ok so at the back we've
got<00:03:17.970> a<00:03:18.000> handle<00:03:18.420> and<00:03:18.690> this<00:03:19.470> gives<00:03:19.680> you<00:03:19.800> access

00:03:19.940 --> 00:03:19.950 
got a handle and this gives you access

00:03:19.950 --> 00:03:22.250 
got a handle and this gives you access
to<00:03:20.190> the<00:03:20.610> fuser<00:03:20.940> this<00:03:21.300> gets<00:03:21.540> hot<00:03:21.780> so<00:03:21.990> just<00:03:22.020> be

00:03:22.250 --> 00:03:22.260 
to the fuser this gets hot so just be

00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:25.220 
to the fuser this gets hot so just be
careful<00:03:22.440> and<00:03:23.030> if<00:03:24.030> you<00:03:24.120> do<00:03:24.240> get<00:03:24.390> any<00:03:24.570> paper<00:03:24.810> jams

00:03:25.220 --> 00:03:25.230 
careful and if you do get any paper jams

00:03:25.230 --> 00:03:27.230 
careful and if you do get any paper jams
you<00:03:25.710> just<00:03:25.920> use<00:03:26.100> these<00:03:26.250> green<00:03:26.580> levers<00:03:27.030> here

00:03:27.230 --> 00:03:27.240 
you just use these green levers here

00:03:27.240 --> 00:03:29.540 
you just use these green levers here
just<00:03:27.510> to<00:03:27.660> release<00:03:28.020> the<00:03:28.710> paper<00:03:28.950> from<00:03:29.250> between

00:03:29.540 --> 00:03:29.550 
just to release the paper from between

00:03:29.550 --> 00:03:34.010 
just to release the paper from between
the<00:03:30.030> fuser<00:03:30.300> rollers<00:03:30.750> and<00:03:32.630> nothing<00:03:33.630> to<00:03:33.750> lock<00:03:33.900> it

00:03:34.010 --> 00:03:34.020 
the fuser rollers and nothing to lock it

00:03:34.020 --> 00:03:36.710 
the fuser rollers and nothing to lock it
on<00:03:34.050> this<00:03:34.290> side<00:03:34.560> so<00:03:35.070> I<00:03:35.310> think<00:03:35.850> that's<00:03:36.180> about<00:03:36.330> it

00:03:36.710 --> 00:03:36.720
