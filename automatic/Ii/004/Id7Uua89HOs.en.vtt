Droid RAZR MAXX here supports flash so

00:03:54.370 --> 00:03:56.070 
Droid RAZR MAXX here supports flash so
it's<00:03:54.880> probably<00:03:55.240> going<00:03:55.390> to<00:03:55.450> take<00:03:55.540> a<00:03:55.660> little<00:03:55.900> bit

00:03:56.070 --> 00:03:56.080 
it's probably going to take a little bit

00:03:56.080 --> 00:03:58.230 
it's probably going to take a little bit
longer<00:03:56.350> to<00:03:56.740> load<00:03:56.920> on<00:03:57.160> the<00:03:57.580> Droid<00:03:57.820> RAZR<00:03:58.060> MAXX

longer to load on the Droid RAZR MAXX

00:03:58.240 --> 00:04:18.420 
longer to load on the Droid RAZR MAXX
because<00:03:58.990> of<00:03:59.110> that

see about how long it takes for that to
load

00:05:04.390 --> 00:05:04.400

right around the same time on that

00:05:10.759 --> 00:05:13.840 
right around the same time on that
particular<00:05:11.300> page<00:05:12.100> bring<00:05:13.100> up<00:05:13.280> another<00:05:13.430> one

00:05:37.830 --> 00:05:37.840 
Motorola so as you can see there's a few

00:05:37.840 --> 00:05:40.080 
Motorola so as you can see there's a few
seconds<00:05:38.350> difference<00:05:38.740> here<00:05:39.070> and<00:05:39.310> now<00:05:39.640> loading
