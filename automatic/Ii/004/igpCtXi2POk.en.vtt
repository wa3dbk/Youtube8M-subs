00:00:03.800 --> 00:00:08.580
 At this year's ADAC child seat test, 40 models from all 

00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:12.420
 Weight classes examined for safety and comfort 

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:14.299
 performance characteristics 

00:00:14.299 --> 00:00:17.690
 although all seats comply with the current regulatory law here 

00:00:17.689 --> 00:00:21.130
 The results range from very good to poor 

00:00:21.130 --> 00:00:25.800
 Unfortunately, registration does not require a side impact test until now 

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:28.800
 the second most expensive accident is action 

00:00:29.409 --> 00:00:34.699
 In any case, the child seat should be the current standard medicine r4 and 40 04 

00:00:34.699 --> 00:00:35.580
 correspond 

00:00:35.580 --> 00:00:39.880
 since this year, children are allowed to have sets that have met the CIA 44 02 

00:00:39.880 --> 00:00:41.310
 no longer be used 

00:00:41.310 --> 00:00:44.550
 these are Skinner sitting in which ideas are ten years and older 

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:52.270
 the most common mistakes are made when transporting larger children than 

00:00:52.270 --> 00:00:55.320
 Belts and airbags were constructed four adults 

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:59.790
 Children should not be as shown here but it is secured in the child seat 

00:00:59.790 --> 00:01:00.660
 become 

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:05.059
 because the child would simply slip out of the belt and heaviest 

00:01:05.059 --> 00:01:08.059
 Get injured 

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:11.410
 the pelvis is still made up of different bones in children 

00:01:11.410 --> 00:01:13.510
 the cents move against each other 

00:01:13.510 --> 00:01:17.140
 that is, so if this child is strapped to the normal vehicle and 

00:01:17.140 --> 00:01:20.730
 Bends the pelvic bones of the belt can over the bone in the abdomen 

00:01:20.730 --> 00:01:21.289
 slip 

00:01:21.289 --> 00:01:24.460
 only good recovery serious internal injuries 

00:01:24.460 --> 00:01:28.280
 just a customized child seat with back and showed support offers 

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:29.790
 adequate protection 

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:32.060
 The child works together 

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:35.060
 but will be safe and without strangulation Seifert salary 

00:01:36.340 --> 00:01:39.430
 important is that all children sitting need side impact protection 

00:01:40.630 --> 00:01:42.870
 older children need that 

00:01:42.870 --> 00:01:47.110
 Such simple looks at higher without lateral support are at one 

00:01:47.110 --> 00:01:51.430
 Side impact not sufficient even if a head airbag is high 

00:01:54.500 --> 00:01:55.590
 for the older ones 

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:58.950
 Think you can forgo a certain because your vehicle with 

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:01.260
 is growing 

00:02:01.260 --> 00:02:04.780
 However, head airbag usually only reaches up to the door's original cantonal butter 

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:09.009
 but the child's head beats underneath the door 

00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:13.109
 Chest is unprotected 

00:02:13.109 --> 00:02:16.779
 measured values ​​compared to the biomechanical limit values 

00:02:16.779 --> 00:02:17.660
 since we are in 

00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:20.539
 Not all of this report 

00:02:20.539 --> 00:02:23.599
 We limit ourselves to the best and worst results 

00:02:24.329 --> 00:02:28.779
 the Roman baby safe Plus II so fix was absolute front runner with the 

00:02:28.779 --> 00:02:31.779
 adac judgment very good 

00:02:33.919 --> 00:02:35.809
 cut particularly well this year 

00:02:35.809 --> 00:02:39.099
 as well as the rear-facing child seats last year 

00:02:39.099 --> 00:02:42.189
 in this construction, the head becomes 

00:02:42.189 --> 00:02:43.269
 the post 

00:02:43.269 --> 00:02:45.429
 completely crashed »when rolling up 

00:02:45.429 --> 00:02:48.719
 That's why the strain on the head and neck is very high 

00:02:48.719 --> 00:02:49.549
 low 

00:02:49.549 --> 00:02:54.169
 the air could not convince the kids he as the name says from air cushions 

00:02:54.169 --> 00:02:57.169
 exists and was rated poorly 

00:02:58.859 --> 00:03:02.729
 the faulty frontal impact was placed in the basket on the way 

00:03:03.719 --> 00:03:06.819
 striking is the big incident concede 

00:03:06.819 --> 00:03:09.819
 triggered by the bay is height adjustable 

00:03:10.919 --> 00:03:13.919
 here were performance Angeles 

00:03:14.639 --> 00:03:18.090
 while trying to walk still head and armrests broke 

00:03:18.090 --> 00:03:21.150
 There was also a deficiency only at the Co 2 

00:03:22.059 --> 00:03:23.719
 Michelin cockpit 

00:03:23.719 --> 00:03:26.979
 does not withstand the burdens 

00:03:26.979 --> 00:03:31.019
 Short guides break off both in the pelvic area and in the neck area 

00:03:31.019 --> 00:03:34.549
 this leads to devaluation and finally to a poor grade 

00:03:34.549 --> 00:03:37.939
 Of course, the legislator should take care of that as soon as possible 

00:03:37.939 --> 00:03:41.409
 a sign on blood tests is integrated into the approval 

00:03:41.409 --> 00:03:44.419
 and in advance, of course, the manufacturer Steller can already ensure 

00:03:44.419 --> 00:03:47.699
 that they voluntarily pass the side impact test a back support 

00:03:47.699 --> 00:03:50.559
 Mount on the child seats 

00:03:50.559 --> 00:03:51.669
 are the parents the best possible
