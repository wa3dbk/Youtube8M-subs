keep those eyes moving all the time and

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:53.149 
keep those eyes moving all the time and
I<00:01:51.420> would<00:01:52.049> say<00:01:52.259> that<00:01:52.470> that's<00:01:52.649> the<00:01:52.979> most

00:01:53.149 --> 00:01:53.159 
I would say that that's the most

00:01:53.159 --> 00:01:55.609 
I would say that that's the most
important<00:01:53.759> part<00:01:53.790> of<00:01:54.180> driving<00:01:54.869> is<00:01:55.290> the

00:01:55.609 --> 00:01:55.619 
important part of driving is the

00:01:55.619 --> 00:01:57.770 
important part of driving is the
scanning<00:01:55.950> because<00:01:56.460> basically<00:01:57.060> that's<00:01:57.390> what's

00:01:57.770 --> 00:01:57.780 
scanning because basically that's what's

00:01:57.780 --> 00:02:00.390 
scanning because basically that's what's
going<00:01:57.930> to<00:01:58.020> save<00:01:58.200> your<00:01:58.409> life
