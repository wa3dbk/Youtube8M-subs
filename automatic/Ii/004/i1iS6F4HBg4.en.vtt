00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.790
 plus 

00:00:00.580 --> 00:00:02.790
 [Music] 

00:00:09.160 --> 00:00:16.779
 hi friends today we are going to learn to play 

00:00:11.969 --> 00:00:19.660
 moon, you like the idea, let's go to it 

00:00:16.779 --> 00:00:21.099
 this is a very simple song ideal 

00:00:19.660 --> 00:00:23.050
 for those who are learning to 

00:00:21.099 --> 00:00:25.420
 play the guitar because only 

00:00:23.050 --> 00:00:28.330
 uses three chords and a pretty rhythm 

00:00:25.420 --> 00:00:31.230
 simple so nothing let's start 

00:00:28.330 --> 00:00:38.520
 watching the intro that sounds like this 

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:38.520
 [Music] 

00:00:40.870 --> 00:00:45.699
 and here the first chord that we 

00:00:42.760 --> 00:00:48.430
 we find this is a seventh major fa 

00:00:45.699 --> 00:00:51.760
 to put it we will leave first agreement to 

00:00:48.430 --> 00:00:54.519
 air then we will put index on fret 

00:00:51.760 --> 00:00:56.890
 one of second rope finger heart in 

00:00:54.519 --> 00:01:00.010
 fret two of the third and cancel in 

00:00:56.890 --> 00:01:02.230
 fret three of the fourth string fa major 

00:01:00.010 --> 00:01:04.420
 seventh 

00:01:02.230 --> 00:01:07.510
 the last two fifth and sixth strings 

00:01:04.420 --> 00:01:09.580
 the next chord should not sound 

00:01:07.510 --> 00:01:11.500
 that we will put is a sixth sun that 

00:01:09.580 --> 00:01:14.979
 it is simply to move this position 

00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:16.510
 two frets up 1 and 2 

00:01:14.979 --> 00:01:17.130
 here is sixth sun 

00:01:16.510 --> 00:01:19.170
 [Music] 

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:21.479
 [Applause] 

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:25.420
 and the third agreed that we will use is 

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:28.360
 a the less than sure you already know him 

00:01:25.420 --> 00:01:30.460
 the one of a lifetime and those are the three 

00:01:28.360 --> 00:01:32.020
 chords that he uses all the time and the 

00:01:30.460 --> 00:01:34.650
 progression that he does is is first with 

00:01:32.020 --> 00:01:34.650
 the greatest fa 

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:40.040
 after the sun 

00:01:37.050 --> 00:01:43.780
 now the minor 

00:01:40.040 --> 00:01:46.280
 and again the sun and I would start again 

00:01:43.780 --> 00:01:49.890
 now that we have the chords we're going to 

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:52.880
 see how does the rhythm that is like that look 

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:53.780
 [Music] 

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:58.040
 [Applause] 

00:01:53.780 --> 00:02:00.420
 [Music] 

00:01:58.040 --> 00:02:02.729
 [Applause] 

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:05.159
 let's put the seventh major fa and 

00:02:02.729 --> 00:02:07.610
 let's start giving up down 

00:02:05.159 --> 00:02:07.610
 A) Yes 

00:02:08.090 --> 00:02:15.390
 and now we do faster is attached 

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:16.860
 upstairs upstairs is cultured and that's 

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:19.020
 last blow we take it for 

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:23.040
 change to the next agreed and we do 

00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:24.630
 same down up and down and now the 

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:28.890
 xunta 

00:02:24.630 --> 00:02:31.910
 the minor down up down 

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:31.910
 and another is sun 

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:43.220
 you have to get in your head so so so 

00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:46.750
 so so so so so let's touch them very 

00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:46.750
 slowly to see if it does not come out 

00:02:46.960 --> 00:02:53.219
 [Applause] 

00:02:48.300 --> 00:02:53.219
 [Music] 

00:02:54.990 --> 00:03:01.220
 is already finished 

00:02:58.400 --> 00:03:03.000
 [Applause] 

00:03:01.220 --> 00:03:04.700
 data 

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:08.420
 do not 

00:03:04.700 --> 00:03:08.590
 so so so 

00:03:08.420 --> 00:03:11.170
 [Music] 

00:03:08.590 --> 00:03:13.880
 [Applause] 

00:03:11.170 --> 00:03:15.910
 [Music] 

00:03:13.880 --> 00:03:19.420
 here it is 

00:03:15.910 --> 00:03:21.760
 that would be again and again and it's already 

00:03:19.420 --> 00:03:23.500
 question of what I practiced and good 

00:03:21.760 --> 00:03:25.150
 what to tell you that since we have the intro 

00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:27.580
 is in the link intro several times 

00:03:25.150 --> 00:03:29.760
 we get to the verse and the verse and 

00:03:27.580 --> 00:03:32.500
 good news because it's exactly 

00:03:29.760 --> 00:03:35.080
 exactly like the intro in fact 

00:03:32.500 --> 00:03:36.820
 if you think it's okay, we'll play again 

00:03:35.080 --> 00:03:38.710
 what do we just do and 

00:03:36.820 --> 00:03:40.500
 we tried to know how it would sound with the 

00:03:38.710 --> 00:03:42.520
 stanza 

00:03:40.500 --> 00:04:12.949
 m 

00:03:42.520 --> 00:04:12.949
 [Music] 

00:04:13.800 --> 00:04:16.160
 two 

00:04:16.239 --> 00:04:21.280
 after this first stanza I would go back 

00:04:18.819 --> 00:04:23.770
 to repeat would do the intro again and 

00:04:21.280 --> 00:04:26.229
 stanza and after the second stanza 

00:04:23.770 --> 00:04:28.599
 we come to the chorus and the chorus 

00:04:26.229 --> 00:04:30.880
 even simpler than everything we have 

00:04:28.599 --> 00:04:33.880
 learned so far because it 's the same 

00:04:30.880 --> 00:04:36.539
 rhythm and only two chords the fa 

00:04:33.880 --> 00:04:36.539
 seventh largest 

00:04:37.930 --> 00:04:43.379
 and the sun 

00:04:40.860 --> 00:04:46.169
 always makes the biggest seventh and the sun 

00:04:43.379 --> 00:04:49.500
 sixth again and again only here is 

00:04:46.169 --> 00:04:51.180
 two times in each chord is okay but it's 

00:04:49.500 --> 00:04:53.669
 the same rhythm only that two times in 

00:04:51.180 --> 00:04:57.169
 every chord let's go let's treat it 

00:04:53.669 --> 00:04:57.169
 slowly to see how we are left 

00:04:59.840 --> 00:05:21.310
 [Music] 

00:05:22.460 --> 00:05:34.050
 I will know 

00:05:25.090 --> 00:05:34.050
 [Music] 

00:05:34.860 --> 00:05:39.430
 good friends we already have the song 

00:05:37.420 --> 00:05:41.440
 complete because that's what we just 

00:05:39.430 --> 00:05:43.780
 learning does not have any more mystery 

00:05:41.440 --> 00:05:45.430
 Now what I recommend is that what 

00:05:43.780 --> 00:05:48.130
 Touch is together with the video demonstration 

00:05:45.430 --> 00:05:50.680
 where you can practice it with the artist 

00:05:48.130 --> 00:05:53.470
 and you'll also get lyrics and chords 

00:05:50.680 --> 00:05:55.810
 I leave the link here below see you 

00:05:53.470 --> 00:05:58.620
 in the next live guitar video 

00:05:55.810 --> 00:05:58.620
 see you later
