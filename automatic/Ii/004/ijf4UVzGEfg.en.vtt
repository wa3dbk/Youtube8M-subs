00:00:04.840 --> 00:00:09.639
 good morning to all the friends of the world 

00:00:06.850 --> 00:00:12.040
 apple in this tutorial we will see how 

00:00:09.639 --> 00:00:17.740
 display the imei code in an instant 

00:00:12.040 --> 00:00:19.330
 and yes yes you have the code imei acronym 

00:00:17.740 --> 00:00:22.840
 of international mobile equipment 

00:00:19.330 --> 00:00:25.420
 identity is a code composed of 15 

00:00:22.840 --> 00:00:28.570
 digits to identify in 

00:00:25.420 --> 00:00:30.850
 unambiguous way mobile phones is 

00:00:28.570 --> 00:00:33.580
 useful if you lose your phone 

00:00:30.850 --> 00:00:35.590
 it will be stolen because it can be 

00:00:33.580 --> 00:00:38.350
 used to report the theft of the 

00:00:35.590 --> 00:00:40.600
 device and then request to the 

00:00:38.350 --> 00:00:42.280
 own telephone operator to block 

00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:46.590
 network access by 

00:00:42.280 --> 00:00:50.430
 the latter the code is yes of 

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:54.700
 acronym of integrated circuits car a ed 

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:57.670
 is a unique 19-digit code 

00:00:54.700 --> 00:01:01.539
 which is assigned to each single sim 

00:00:57.670 --> 00:01:04.360
 produced and released in the market serves 

00:01:01.539 --> 00:01:07.509
 to identify the sim chip e 

00:01:04.360 --> 00:01:08.950
 subsequently the user associated with 

00:01:07.509 --> 00:01:13.780
 that sim card 

00:01:08.950 --> 00:01:15.780
 this code is used to replace one 

00:01:13.780 --> 00:01:19.509
 sim not working or expired a 

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:22.149
 replace the format of a sim then 

00:01:19.509 --> 00:01:24.700
 from normal to micro a year sim e 

00:01:22.149 --> 00:01:27.459
 vice versa to change operator 

00:01:24.700 --> 00:01:30.399
 keeping the same phone number 

00:01:27.459 --> 00:01:35.319
 so portability we see together 

00:01:30.399 --> 00:01:38.440
 how to trace these codes through the 

00:01:35.319 --> 00:01:41.229
 our iphone and our mac because 

00:01:38.440 --> 00:01:43.390
 this can be done by different people 

00:01:41.229 --> 00:01:46.810
 seats 

00:01:43.390 --> 00:01:48.399
 let's see them together if he still owns the 

00:01:46.810 --> 00:01:51.640
 original packaging of the device 

00:01:48.399 --> 00:01:55.420
 you can find the serial number and the one 

00:01:51.640 --> 00:01:57.849
 that mei is printed 

00:01:55.420 --> 00:02:00.459
 on the barcode label 

00:01:57.849 --> 00:02:05.170
 in my case I took the picture of you 

00:02:00.459 --> 00:02:08.950
 of my box where I could 

00:02:05.170 --> 00:02:10.599
 find this information 

00:02:08.950 --> 00:02:13.170
 and these are what you see that I am 

00:02:10.599 --> 00:02:13.170
 reporting 

00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:25.880
 we can also see it via itunes 

00:02:21.770 --> 00:02:28.910
 on the computer or connect the iPhone 

00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:35.560
 to the computer and click on the panel 

00:02:28.910 --> 00:02:39.350
 summary is obviously we open itunes 

00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:43.930
 click on our phone 

00:02:39.350 --> 00:02:43.930
 click on summary 

00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:59.120
 and in this section we see our own 

00:02:52.760 --> 00:03:02.960
 codes we see it here in the third line e 

00:02:59.120 --> 00:03:09.560
 clicking on it automatically 

00:03:02.960 --> 00:03:14.380
 he flips them all if I press 

00:03:09.560 --> 00:03:16.970
 right copy I can copy the code e 

00:03:14.380 --> 00:03:19.160
 paste it very simply and 

00:03:16.970 --> 00:03:22.490
 quick on the registration forms 

00:03:19.160 --> 00:03:24.380
 apple for online service evenings or for 

00:03:22.490 --> 00:03:28.640
 contact apple support 

00:03:24.380 --> 00:03:35.030
 let's see how for example serial number 

00:03:28.640 --> 00:03:39.680
 right click on the copy number and then 

00:03:35.030 --> 00:03:41.680
 I can copy it on the forms of 

00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:46.130
 recordings quickly and easily 

00:03:41.680 --> 00:03:49.220
 without the possibility of being wrong 

00:03:46.130 --> 00:03:51.950
 I also advise you to save yourself the 

00:03:49.220 --> 00:03:55.730
 imei code of yours in yours 

00:03:51.950 --> 00:03:58.690
 mac keychain as it is a given 

00:03:55.730 --> 00:04:02.270
 very important as we have seen 

00:03:58.690 --> 00:04:05.870
 while the code i is i can of it 

00:04:02.270 --> 00:04:08.870
 find also on the sim card that inside 

00:04:05.870 --> 00:04:11.090
 to our phone in case the 

00:04:08.870 --> 00:04:14.800
 our iphone has been lost 

00:04:11.090 --> 00:04:17.800
 then open itunes go in 

00:04:14.800 --> 00:04:17.800
 preferences 

00:04:24.490 --> 00:04:34.700
 what we are interested in is found 

00:04:27.820 --> 00:04:37.390
 in the device panel that if 

00:04:34.700 --> 00:04:40.280
 we keep the mouse on a backup 

00:04:37.390 --> 00:04:43.430
 we can view the serial number 

00:04:40.280 --> 00:04:45.410
 of that device will also come 

00:04:43.430 --> 00:04:53.860
 also displayed e-mail numbers e 

00:04:45.410 --> 00:05:00.800
 numbers and yes and how you can see 

00:04:53.860 --> 00:05:09.260
 our codes appear we do a 

00:05:00.800 --> 00:05:13.390
 nothing on the iphone instead the codes li 

00:05:09.260 --> 00:05:13.390
 we find in settings 

00:05:14.270 --> 00:05:24.370
 we scroll down and click on general and 

00:05:21.919 --> 00:05:24.370
 info 

00:05:26.570 --> 00:05:37.880
 scroll down where we will find the 

00:05:32.630 --> 00:05:41.360
 model number the serial number 

00:05:37.880 --> 00:05:43.600
 the imei code and the code and yes 

00:05:41.360 --> 00:05:43.600
