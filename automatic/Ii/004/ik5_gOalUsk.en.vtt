another machine comes along and picks
them<00:01:50.920> up<00:01:51.009> and<00:01:51.280> dumps<00:01:51.640> them<00:01:51.759> into<00:01:52.000> a<00:01:52.030> 4x4<00:01:52.360> tote

00:01:52.960 --> 00:01:55.470 
them up and dumps them into a 4x4 tote
okay<00:01:53.740> and<00:01:53.950> that<00:01:54.190> tote<00:01:54.460> is<00:01:54.670> then<00:01:54.940> dumped<00:01:55.330> into

00:01:55.470 --> 00:01:55.480 
okay and that tote is then dumped into

00:01:55.480 --> 00:01:58.410 
okay and that tote is then dumped into
the<00:01:55.870> bin<00:01:56.620> that<00:01:56.650> you<00:01:56.860> see<00:01:57.580> over<00:01:57.850> here<00:01:57.880> after<00:01:58.210> a

00:01:58.410 --> 00:01:58.420 
the bin that you see over here after a

00:01:58.420 --> 00:01:59.430 
the bin that you see over here after a
bit<00:01:58.630> okay

00:01:59.430 --> 00:01:59.440 
bit okay

00:01:59.440 --> 00:02:01.590 
bit okay
so<00:01:59.710> when<00:02:00.159> you're<00:02:00.370> like<00:02:00.700> I've<00:02:00.880> also<00:02:01.180> heard

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:01.600 
so when you're like I've also heard

00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:03.420 
so when you're like I've also heard
people<00:02:01.659> actually<00:02:02.140> shaking<00:02:02.800> the<00:02:02.920> trees<00:02:03.190> is

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:03.430 
people actually shaking the trees is

00:02:03.430 --> 00:02:05.010 
people actually shaking the trees is
that<00:02:03.490> is<00:02:03.820> that<00:02:03.850> a<00:02:03.970> common<00:02:04.330> factor<00:02:04.690> well<00:02:04.990> I

00:02:05.010 --> 00:02:05.020 
that is that a common factor well I

00:02:05.020 --> 00:02:06.660 
that is that a common factor well I
haven't<00:02:05.409> quite<00:02:05.740> figured<00:02:05.979> out<00:02:06.159> how<00:02:06.220> to<00:02:06.340> do<00:02:06.550> that

00:02:06.660 --> 00:02:06.670 
haven't quite figured out how to do that

00:02:06.670 --> 00:02:08.940 
haven't quite figured out how to do that
because<00:02:06.880> that's<00:02:07.720> all<00:02:07.990> over<00:02:08.260> the<00:02:08.350> ground<00:02:08.560> and

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:08.950 
because that's all over the ground and

00:02:08.950 --> 00:02:11.009 
because that's all over the ground and
to<00:02:09.190> drive<00:02:09.489> in<00:02:09.880> the<00:02:10.030> field<00:02:10.330> with<00:02:10.600> a<00:02:10.630> machine

00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:11.019 
to drive in the field with a machine

00:02:11.019 --> 00:02:13.170 
to drive in the field with a machine
that'll<00:02:11.230> shake<00:02:11.440> the<00:02:11.620> tree<00:02:11.860> so<00:02:12.100> I<00:02:12.130> do<00:02:12.610> shake<00:02:13.060> the

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:13.180 
that'll shake the tree so I do shake the

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:16.740 
that'll shake the tree so I do shake the
trees<00:02:13.420> but<00:02:13.690> by<00:02:13.900> hand<00:02:14.140> okay<00:02:14.769> yeah

00:02:16.740 --> 00:02:16.750 
trees but by hand okay yeah

00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:19.530 
trees but by hand okay yeah
just<00:02:17.739> I<00:02:17.980> try<00:02:18.430> to<00:02:18.489> wait<00:02:18.700> for<00:02:18.940> the<00:02:19.060> good<00:02:19.299> weather

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:19.540 
just I try to wait for the good weather

00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:21.210 
just I try to wait for the good weather
and<00:02:19.900> it<00:02:20.019> looks<00:02:20.320> like<00:02:20.380> it's<00:02:20.590> gonna<00:02:20.680> rain<00:02:20.769> we

00:02:21.210 --> 00:02:21.220 
and it looks like it's gonna rain we

00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:23.940 
and it looks like it's gonna rain we
will<00:02:21.430> shake<00:02:21.820> few<00:02:22.090> trees<00:02:22.390> and<00:02:22.780> try<00:02:23.709> and<00:02:23.860> get

00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:23.950 
will shake few trees and try and get

00:02:23.950 --> 00:02:25.020 
will shake few trees and try and get
most<00:02:24.190> of<00:02:24.370> them<00:02:24.519> on<00:02:24.580> the<00:02:24.700> ground

00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:25.030 
most of them on the ground

00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:27.630 
most of them on the ground
perfect<00:02:25.570> now<00:02:25.930> I<00:02:26.230> was<00:02:26.709> here<00:02:26.950> earlier<00:02:27.400> and<00:02:27.549> you

00:02:27.630 --> 00:02:27.640 
perfect now I was here earlier and you

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:29.100 
perfect now I was here earlier and you
had<00:02:27.820> your<00:02:27.940> machinery<00:02:28.330> working<00:02:28.930> and<00:02:29.019> you've

00:02:29.100 --> 00:02:29.110 
had your machinery working and you've

00:02:29.110 --> 00:02:31.320 
had your machinery working and you've
got<00:02:29.350> a<00:02:29.590> really<00:02:30.040> neat<00:02:30.400> machine<00:02:30.880> that<00:02:31.120> I<00:02:31.150> guess

00:02:31.320 --> 00:02:31.330 
got a really neat machine that I guess

00:02:31.330 --> 00:02:33.840 
got a really neat machine that I guess
takes<00:02:31.630> them<00:02:31.810> from<00:02:31.989> what<00:02:32.590> you<00:02:32.709> you<00:02:33.160> scoop<00:02:33.670> them

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:33.850 
takes them from what you you scoop them

00:02:33.850 --> 00:02:35.580 
takes them from what you you scoop them
up<00:02:33.910> in<00:02:34.090> the<00:02:34.180> field<00:02:34.450> and<00:02:34.690> then<00:02:35.170> I<00:02:35.290> guess<00:02:35.440> you

00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:35.590 
up in the field and then I guess you

00:02:35.590 --> 00:02:36.930 
up in the field and then I guess you
wash<00:02:35.830> them<00:02:36.070> and<00:02:36.250> sort<00:02:36.430> them<00:02:36.519> how<00:02:36.670> does<00:02:36.820> that

00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:36.940 
wash them and sort them how does that

00:02:36.940 --> 00:02:38.729 
wash them and sort them how does that
work<00:02:37.150> what's<00:02:37.390> autosense<00:02:37.900> there<00:02:38.200> we<00:02:38.440> have<00:02:38.590> to

00:02:38.729 --> 00:02:38.739 
work what's autosense there we have to

00:02:38.739 --> 00:02:40.320 
work what's autosense there we have to
run<00:02:38.890> them<00:02:39.010> through<00:02:39.040> a<00:02:39.250> cleaning<00:02:39.700> line<00:02:39.880> because

00:02:40.320 --> 00:02:40.330 
run them through a cleaning line because

00:02:40.330 --> 00:02:42.000 
run them through a cleaning line because
when<00:02:40.690> you<00:02:40.780> harvest<00:02:40.989> with<00:02:41.200> machinery<00:02:41.680> it<00:02:41.830> picks

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:42.010 
when you harvest with machinery it picks

00:02:42.010 --> 00:02:46.020 
when you harvest with machinery it picks
everything<00:02:42.280> up<00:02:42.489> rocks<00:02:42.970> stick<00:02:44.549> mostly<00:02:45.549> nuts

00:02:46.020 --> 00:02:46.030 
everything up rocks stick mostly nuts

00:02:46.030 --> 00:02:48.080 
everything up rocks stick mostly nuts
you<00:02:46.269> know<00:02:46.390> he<00:02:47.049> hope<00:02:47.260> yeah<00:02:47.470> and

00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:48.090 
you know he hope yeah and

00:02:48.090 --> 00:02:50.240 
you know he hope yeah and
and<00:02:48.180> they<00:02:48.390> go<00:02:48.660> through<00:02:48.930> a<00:02:48.959> washer<00:02:49.590> and<00:02:49.920> the

00:02:50.240 --> 00:02:50.250 
and they go through a washer and the

00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:52.790 
and they go through a washer and the
deed<00:02:51.060> rocker<00:02:51.360> okay<00:02:52.230> and<00:02:52.440> then<00:02:52.530> you<00:02:52.650> go<00:02:52.770> through

00:02:52.790 --> 00:02:52.800 
deed rocker okay and then you go through

00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:55.850 
deed rocker okay and then you go through
a<00:02:53.040> final<00:02:53.310> cleaning<00:02:53.730> final<00:02:54.510> washer<00:02:54.930> and<00:02:55.410> from

00:02:55.850 --> 00:02:55.860 
a final cleaning final washer and from

00:02:55.860 --> 00:02:57.949 
a final cleaning final washer and from
there<00:02:56.040> they<00:02:56.190> go<00:02:56.340> into<00:02:56.520> a<00:02:56.640> kiln<00:02:57.000> can<00:02:57.750> they're

00:02:57.949 --> 00:02:57.959 
there they go into a kiln can they're

00:02:57.959 --> 00:03:00.350 
there they go into a kiln can they're
dried<00:02:58.290> just<00:02:59.160> enough<00:02:59.430> moisture<00:02:59.640> often<00:03:00.209> that

00:03:00.350 --> 00:03:00.360 
dried just enough moisture often that

00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:01.309 
dried just enough moisture often that
they're<00:03:00.540> still<00:03:00.750> fresh

00:03:01.309 --> 00:03:01.319 
they're still fresh

00:03:01.319 --> 00:03:03.470 
they're still fresh
right<00:03:01.680> and<00:03:02.069> they<00:03:02.190> come<00:03:02.370> out<00:03:02.459> of<00:03:02.520> the<00:03:02.730> kiln<00:03:03.270> they

00:03:03.470 --> 00:03:03.480 
right and they come out of the kiln they

00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:06.229 
right and they come out of the kiln they
go<00:03:03.660> through<00:03:03.989> a<00:03:04.160> tumbler<00:03:05.160> that<00:03:05.190> sizes<00:03:06.030> them

00:03:06.229 --> 00:03:06.239 
go through a tumbler that sizes them

00:03:06.239 --> 00:03:09.740 
go through a tumbler that sizes them
right<00:03:06.900> and<00:03:07.560> then<00:03:07.800> we<00:03:07.980> put<00:03:08.190> them<00:03:08.340> through<00:03:08.750> a

00:03:09.740 --> 00:03:09.750 
right and then we put them through a

00:03:09.750 --> 00:03:12.140 
right and then we put them through a
suction<00:03:10.470> system<00:03:10.890> that<00:03:11.280> folds<00:03:11.580> all<00:03:11.730> the<00:03:11.819> blanks

00:03:12.140 --> 00:03:12.150 
suction system that folds all the blanks

00:03:12.150 --> 00:03:15.110 
suction system that folds all the blanks
of<00:03:12.300> because<00:03:12.660> there<00:03:13.440> are<00:03:13.860> always<00:03:14.160> blanks<00:03:14.940> in

00:03:15.110 --> 00:03:15.120 
of because there are always blanks in

00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:17.330 
of because there are always blanks in
hazelnuts<00:03:15.690> and<00:03:15.870> you<00:03:15.989> can't<00:03:16.230> sell<00:03:16.530> that<00:03:16.560> yeah

00:03:17.330 --> 00:03:17.340 
hazelnuts and you can't sell that yeah

00:03:17.340 --> 00:03:19.460 
hazelnuts and you can't sell that yeah
that<00:03:17.580> to<00:03:17.730> the<00:03:17.849> Pope<00:03:18.000> oh<00:03:18.030> yeah<00:03:18.720> you<00:03:19.140> don't<00:03:19.260> taste

as<00:03:19.650> good<00:03:19.800> again<00:03:20.069> and<00:03:20.459> they<00:03:20.880> know<00:03:21.360> when<00:03:22.019> they

00:03:22.190 --> 00:03:22.200 
as good again and they know when they

00:03:22.200 --> 00:03:25.910 
as good again and they know when they
come<00:03:22.500> out<00:03:22.560> of<00:03:22.709> the<00:03:22.950> that<00:03:23.940> line<00:03:24.870> through<00:03:25.440> the

00:03:25.910 --> 00:03:25.920 
come out of the that line through the

00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:28.430 
come out of the that line through the
tumbler<00:03:26.670> and<00:03:26.700> the<00:03:27.030> suction<00:03:27.510> thing<00:03:28.140> is

00:03:28.430 --> 00:03:28.440 
tumbler and the suction thing is

00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:32.650 
tumbler and the suction thing is
probably<00:03:28.950> 95<00:03:29.370> to<00:03:29.549> 98%<00:03:29.970> they're<00:03:30.600> full<00:03:30.959> and

00:03:32.650 --> 00:03:32.660 
probably 95 to 98% they're full and

00:03:32.660 --> 00:03:35.210 
probably 95 to 98% they're full and
they're<00:03:33.660> ready<00:03:33.840> to<00:03:33.930> bag<00:03:34.260> up<00:03:34.410> and<00:03:34.560> sell<00:03:34.799> and

00:03:35.210 --> 00:03:35.220 
they're ready to bag up and sell and

00:03:44.539 --> 00:03:44.549 
need to do to the tree to to produce

00:03:44.549 --> 00:03:46.479 
need to do to the tree to to produce
it's<00:03:44.880> going<00:03:45.060> to<00:03:45.150> get<00:03:45.239> a<00:03:45.269> great<00:03:45.989> problem

it's going to get a great problem
fertilizing<00:03:47.489> fertilizing<00:03:48.420> is<00:03:48.630> important

00:03:49.370 --> 00:03:49.380 
fertilizing fertilizing is important

it's worked very well for us okay the
trees<00:04:06.430> are<00:04:06.670> just<00:04:06.940> loving<00:04:07.209> what<00:04:07.600> about<00:04:08.140> pruning

00:04:08.430 --> 00:04:08.440 
trees are just loving what about pruning

00:04:08.440 --> 00:04:10.110 
trees are just loving what about pruning
I<00:04:08.650> mean<00:04:08.830> I<00:04:08.920> when<00:04:09.130> I<00:04:09.160> was<00:04:09.400> growing<00:04:09.760> up<00:04:09.880> in

00:04:10.110 --> 00:04:10.120 
I mean I when I was growing up in

00:04:10.120 --> 00:04:12.750 
I mean I when I was growing up in
Chilliwack<00:04:10.870> they<00:04:11.290> had<00:04:11.560> the<00:04:12.160> orchards<00:04:12.640> I

00:04:12.750 --> 00:04:12.760 
Chilliwack they had the orchards I

00:04:12.760 --> 00:04:15.540 
Chilliwack they had the orchards I
remember<00:04:13.209> they<00:04:13.330> had<00:04:13.530> multi-step<00:04:14.550> hazelnuts

00:04:15.540 --> 00:04:15.550 
remember they had multi-step hazelnuts

00:04:15.550 --> 00:04:17.039 
remember they had multi-step hazelnuts
and<00:04:15.730> you<00:04:15.790> can<00:04:15.940> barely<00:04:16.120> walk<00:04:16.299> through<00:04:16.840> but

00:04:17.039 --> 00:04:17.049 
and you can barely walk through but

00:04:17.049 --> 00:04:18.330 
and you can barely walk through but
we've<00:04:17.380> got<00:04:17.530> a<00:04:17.560> fair<00:04:17.799> amount<00:04:17.829> of<00:04:18.010> space<00:04:18.160> here

00:04:18.330 --> 00:04:18.340 
we've got a fair amount of space here

00:04:18.340 --> 00:04:20.640 
we've got a fair amount of space here
and<00:04:18.700> they're<00:04:18.880> all<00:04:19.000> single<00:04:19.299> stems<00:04:19.720> is<00:04:19.989> that<00:04:20.139> is

00:04:20.640 --> 00:04:20.650 
and they're all single stems is that is

00:04:20.650 --> 00:04:22.530 
and they're all single stems is that is
that<00:04:20.889> a<00:04:20.919> just<00:04:21.370> a<00:04:21.489> style<00:04:21.910> that<00:04:22.240> you're<00:04:22.360> using

00:04:22.530 --> 00:04:22.540 
that a just a style that you're using

00:04:22.540 --> 00:04:25.409 
that a just a style that you're using
orizari<00:04:23.290> it<00:04:23.410> is<00:04:23.560> the<00:04:24.250> his<00:04:24.430> on<00:04:24.669> tree<00:04:24.910> wants<00:04:25.120> to

00:04:25.409 --> 00:04:25.419 
orizari it is the his on tree wants to

00:04:25.419 --> 00:04:28.530 
orizari it is the his on tree wants to
grow<00:04:25.600> as<00:04:25.840> a<00:04:25.870> bush<00:04:26.320> and<00:04:27.120> train<00:04:28.120> them<00:04:28.300> into<00:04:28.510> a

00:04:28.530 --> 00:04:28.540 
grow as a bush and train them into a

00:04:28.540 --> 00:04:30.000 
grow as a bush and train them into a
single<00:04:28.810> stem<00:04:29.200> because<00:04:29.380> it's<00:04:29.650> just<00:04:29.800> much

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:30.010 
single stem because it's just much

00:04:30.010 --> 00:04:32.430 
single stem because it's just much
easier<00:04:30.040> to<00:04:30.640> manage<00:04:30.970> the<00:04:31.390> orchard<00:04:31.750> with

00:04:32.430 --> 00:04:32.440 
easier to manage the orchard with

00:04:32.440 --> 00:04:35.640 
easier to manage the orchard with
equipment<00:04:32.830> and<00:04:33.220> yeah<00:04:33.850> so<00:04:34.510> we've<00:04:35.230> pruned<00:04:35.530> the

00:04:35.640 --> 00:04:35.650 
equipment and yeah so we've pruned the

00:04:35.650 --> 00:04:37.710 
equipment and yeah so we've pruned the
suckers<00:04:36.040> to<00:04:36.220> both<00:04:36.370> the<00:04:36.730> two<00:04:37.180> or<00:04:37.300> three<00:04:37.330> times

00:04:37.710 --> 00:04:37.720 
suckers to both the two or three times

00:04:37.720 --> 00:04:41.400 
suckers to both the two or three times
during<00:04:38.380> the<00:04:38.560> year<00:04:38.590> okay<00:04:39.460> keep<00:04:40.060> some<00:04:40.330> keep<00:04:41.140> some

00:04:41.400 --> 00:04:41.410 
during the year okay keep some keep some

00:04:41.410 --> 00:04:43.980 
during the year okay keep some keep some
back<00:04:41.830> you<00:04:42.250> know<00:04:42.340> but<00:04:42.700> you<00:04:42.880> could<00:04:43.090> you<00:04:43.810> could

00:04:43.980 --> 00:04:43.990 
back you know but you could you could

00:04:43.990 --> 00:04:47.040 
back you know but you could you could
cut<00:04:44.230> the<00:04:44.650> tree<00:04:44.950> off<00:04:45.160> in<00:04:45.850> a<00:04:45.970> very<00:04:46.270> versatile

00:04:47.040 --> 00:04:47.050 
cut the tree off in a very versatile

00:04:47.050 --> 00:04:50.010 
cut the tree off in a very versatile
tree<00:04:47.440> at<00:04:47.979> the<00:04:48.160> ground<00:04:48.490> yeah<00:04:49.090> they'll<00:04:49.720> grow

00:04:50.010 --> 00:04:50.020 
tree at the ground yeah they'll grow

00:04:50.020 --> 00:04:51.630 
tree at the ground yeah they'll grow
again<00:04:50.440> because<00:04:50.800> of<00:04:50.830> all<00:04:51.040> the<00:04:51.160> suckers<00:04:51.370> that

00:04:51.630 --> 00:04:51.640 
again because of all the suckers that

00:04:51.640 --> 00:04:54.300 
again because of all the suckers that
wanna<00:04:51.940> come<00:04:52.030> on<00:04:52.300> okay<00:04:52.930> well<00:04:53.650> I<00:04:53.680> was<00:04:53.860> gonna<00:04:54.010> that

00:04:57.780 --> 00:04:57.790 
was my next question and they can't

00:04:57.790 --> 00:04:59.430 
was my next question and they can't
afford<00:04:57.910> to<00:04:58.180> have<00:04:58.270> a<00:04:58.390> large<00:04:58.780> tree<00:04:59.050> even<00:04:59.320> though

00:04:59.430 --> 00:04:59.440 
afford to have a large tree even though

00:04:59.440 --> 00:05:01.380 
afford to have a large tree even though
these<00:04:59.680> are<00:04:59.860> quite<00:05:00.250> a<00:05:00.310> small<00:05:00.669> tree<00:05:00.940> if<00:05:01.150> you

00:05:01.380 --> 00:05:01.390 
these are quite a small tree if you

00:05:01.390 --> 00:05:03.570 
these are quite a small tree if you
wanted<00:05:01.750> to<00:05:01.870> keep<00:05:02.020> it<00:05:02.229> at<00:05:02.320> a<00:05:02.350> very<00:05:02.950> small<00:05:03.040> bush

00:05:03.570 --> 00:05:03.580 
wanted to keep it at a very small bush

00:05:03.580 --> 00:05:06.120 
wanted to keep it at a very small bush
level<00:05:04.000> maybe<00:05:04.210> is<00:05:04.479> you<00:05:04.960> know<00:05:05.140> six<00:05:05.470> to<00:05:05.560> ten<00:05:05.830> feet

00:05:06.120 --> 00:05:06.130 
level maybe is you know six to ten feet

00:05:06.130 --> 00:05:08.610 
level maybe is you know six to ten feet
high<00:05:06.430> could<00:05:07.060> you<00:05:07.150> still<00:05:07.419> do<00:05:07.780> that<00:05:07.960> and<00:05:08.020> and<00:05:08.440> get

00:05:08.610 --> 00:05:08.620 
high could you still do that and and get

00:05:08.620 --> 00:05:11.340 
high could you still do that and and get
some<00:05:08.770> fruit<00:05:09.010> off<00:05:09.130> of<00:05:09.340> it<00:05:09.490> oh<00:05:09.700> yes<00:05:10.300> yeah<00:05:11.050> you

00:05:11.340 --> 00:05:11.350 
some fruit off of it oh yes yeah you

00:05:11.350 --> 00:05:12.810 
some fruit off of it oh yes yeah you
could<00:05:11.500> let<00:05:11.680> them<00:05:11.800> grow<00:05:12.010> as<00:05:12.190> a<00:05:12.220> bush<00:05:12.490> and<00:05:12.700> that's

00:05:12.810 --> 00:05:12.820 
could let them grow as a bush and that's

00:05:12.820 --> 00:05:15.029 
could let them grow as a bush and that's
what<00:05:13.030> most<00:05:13.210> people<00:05:13.570> do<00:05:13.720> when<00:05:13.930> a<00:05:14.140> but<00:05:14.440> for<00:05:14.860> their

backyard
yeah<00:05:16.330> let's<00:05:17.080> grow<00:05:17.350> and<00:05:17.680> you<00:05:17.800> can<00:05:17.979> prune<00:05:18.280> out

00:05:19.019 --> 00:05:19.029 
yeah let's grow and you can prune out

00:05:19.029 --> 00:05:21.600 
yeah let's grow and you can prune out
every<00:05:19.509> second<00:05:20.469> year<00:05:20.649> you<00:05:20.829> can<00:05:20.979> take<00:05:21.219> out<00:05:21.369> some

00:05:21.600 --> 00:05:21.610 
every second year you can take out some

00:05:21.610 --> 00:05:24.569 
every second year you can take out some
of<00:05:21.699> the<00:05:21.759> oldest<00:05:22.119> stem<00:05:22.360> that's<00:05:23.019> like<00:05:23.619> to<00:05:23.829> grow

00:05:24.569 --> 00:05:24.579 
of the oldest stem that's like to grow

00:05:24.579 --> 00:05:27.809 
of the oldest stem that's like to grow
on<00:05:24.999> one<00:05:25.569> and<00:05:25.869> two<00:05:25.959> year<00:05:26.319> old<00:05:26.499> wood<00:05:26.829> yeah<00:05:27.339> so

00:05:27.809 --> 00:05:27.819 
on one and two year old wood yeah so
