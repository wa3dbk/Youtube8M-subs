00:01:47.409 --> 00:01:49.440 
turns into a milk this is soy milk so
this<00:01:47.619> is<00:01:47.770> an<00:01:47.860> ingredient<00:01:48.369> in<00:01:48.430> our<00:01:48.579> mousse<00:01:48.970> but

00:01:49.440 --> 00:01:49.450 
this is an ingredient in our mousse but

00:01:49.450 --> 00:01:51.569 
this is an ingredient in our mousse but
this<00:01:49.600> is<00:01:49.750> also<00:01:49.930> what<00:01:50.200> tofu<00:01:50.650> is<00:01:50.770> made<00:01:51.009> out<00:01:51.159> of<00:01:51.189> so

00:01:51.569 --> 00:01:51.579 
this is also what tofu is made out of so

00:01:51.579 --> 00:01:55.200 
this is also what tofu is made out of so
soy<00:01:52.150> milk<00:01:52.540> is<00:01:52.720> turned<00:01:53.500> into<00:01:53.829> a<00:01:54.310> cheese<00:01:54.880> just

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:55.210 
soy milk is turned into a cheese just

00:01:55.210 --> 00:01:57.359 
soy milk is turned into a cheese just
similar<00:01:55.960> to<00:01:56.140> how<00:01:56.259> Dairy<00:01:56.619> Milk<00:01:56.860> is<00:01:57.009> turned<00:01:57.250> into

00:01:57.359 --> 00:01:57.369 
similar to how Dairy Milk is turned into

00:01:57.369 --> 00:01:59.730 
similar to how Dairy Milk is turned into
cheese<00:01:57.670> and<00:01:57.939> so<00:01:58.060> soy<00:01:58.360> milk<00:01:58.689> will<00:01:59.229> be<00:01:59.259> turned

00:01:59.730 --> 00:01:59.740 
cheese and so soy milk will be turned

00:01:59.740 --> 00:02:03.510 
cheese and so soy milk will be turned
into<00:02:00.149> tofu<00:02:01.149> this<00:02:01.390> is<00:02:01.600> tofu<00:02:02.020> right<00:02:02.259> here<00:02:02.649> and<00:02:02.860> so

00:02:03.510 --> 00:02:03.520 
into tofu this is tofu right here and so

00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:05.550 
into tofu this is tofu right here and so
this<00:02:03.729> is<00:02:03.939> our<00:02:04.270> chief<00:02:04.540> ingredient<00:02:04.869> and<00:02:05.290> I

00:02:05.550 --> 00:02:05.560 
this is our chief ingredient and I

00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:07.499 
this is our chief ingredient and I
always<00:02:05.740> tell<00:02:05.979> my<00:02:06.100> students<00:02:06.490> to<00:02:06.640> think<00:02:06.820> of<00:02:07.000> tofu

00:02:07.499 --> 00:02:07.509 
always tell my students to think of tofu

00:02:07.509 --> 00:02:10.050
