00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.799
 hello friends are you chicken well too 

00:00:02.129 --> 00:00:06.870
 man me too and on this occasion I 

00:00:04.799 --> 00:00:09.090
 I will bring how to put the color 

00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:11.759
 pearly in any type of painting and 

00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:14.849
 be matt chrome and so on the truth that 

00:00:11.759 --> 00:00:17.550
 today I think it 's the day of the tricks 

00:00:14.849 --> 00:00:20.880
 old because this trick too 

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:22.619
 quite old but good as the one in the 

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:24.869
 first person and while he is in my 

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:27.359
 channel and all of that and also well can 

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:28.800
 that there are people who do not know and 

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:31.980
 what we have to do is buy a 

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:34.079
 matte color like those seen and we have 

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:36.660
 to get into the metallized move a 

00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:38.850
 little crosshead get out not get into 

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:41.730
 wheel accessories compare a smoke 

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:44.760
 leave no and no again to paint and 

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:46.320
 we can have the pearl if you have 

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:47.730
 lost because he spoke very fast to 

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:49.260
 take back because the truth that I 

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:52.079
 I also lost a bit when commenting 

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:56.910
 but if this is the same as always, the process 

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:58.620
 truth without guilt and that because the truth 

00:00:56.910 --> 00:01:01.559
 that is pretty good we can get him 

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:03.480
 the pearly color to any painting and 

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:06.290
 what is said either mate 

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:09.390
 metallic such as gold color 

00:01:06.290 --> 00:01:12.119
 whether chromed what happens that the 

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:15.540
 chrome is not distinguished very well but if 

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:17.340
 there is a slight change and good with this 

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:20.300
 and the myriad of colors that you 

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:20.300
 can put a car 

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:27.420
 a lot of truth because if before 

00:01:23.939 --> 00:01:31.430
 could with the metallic and he 

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:34.820
 and the pearly was now with the mate and 

00:01:31.430 --> 00:01:36.770
 another and the other colors because already virtue 

00:01:34.820 --> 00:01:40.550
 so good as you are here watching the 

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:42.650
 blue in mate that looks pretty cool and 

00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:45.470
 well the secondary colander do not have 

00:01:42.650 --> 00:01:47.690
 clarified sometimes I tried to put it and 

00:01:45.470 --> 00:01:50.479
 there is green some curious fact is that the 

00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:53.990
 secondary color is so finished too 

00:01:50.479 --> 00:01:57.650
 it's weird here as you see I do not know if what 

00:01:53.990 --> 00:02:00.860
 you will come to appreciate it is like changing 

00:01:57.650 --> 00:02:02.840
 and I do not know if it's weird the truth is weird 

00:02:00.860 --> 00:02:04.790
 later later in some sheets what 

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:08.270
 I will show that the secondary color is 

00:02:04.790 --> 00:02:10.070
 as in clarified and good then the truth 

00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:12.830
 is that it's pretty good here as you see 

00:02:10.070 --> 00:02:15.770
 I'll try it now with him with the 

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:18.800
 aluminum I think a little bit in steel yes with 

00:02:15.770 --> 00:02:21.410
 steel is an actor with zero and you see that 

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:23.300
 it does not leave me pearly then then here 

00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:25.010
 I forgot to give it to metallic and go to 

00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:28.250
 see how they do not come out 

00:02:25.010 --> 00:02:30.110
 and as a dance I give painting and it does not come out 

00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:31.040
 because I forget about the metallic 

00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:32.569
 then what you have to do 

00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:35.269
 Metallized move the crosshead a little 

00:02:32.569 --> 00:02:37.610
 leave is said to wheels 

00:02:35.269 --> 00:02:39.290
 buy a smoke if we already have a like 

00:02:37.610 --> 00:02:42.319
 Buy for wrapping select 

00:02:39.290 --> 00:02:44.269
 we are going to lock up painting and have finished 

00:02:42.319 --> 00:02:47.329
 and it does not leave us anymore and it leaves us like 

00:02:44.269 --> 00:02:50.390
 that is seeing the truth that in steel 

00:02:47.329 --> 00:02:53.329
 the pearl is very well as you can see 

00:02:50.390 --> 00:02:56.510
 note quite and here all the colors 

00:02:53.329 --> 00:02:58.489
 what can be done and especially look at 

00:02:56.510 --> 00:03:01.670
 blue I do not know why but I do love in 

00:02:58.489 --> 00:03:05.329
 Steel in steel with blue is to keep 

00:03:01.670 --> 00:03:07.670
 It's a pass and then nothing, I'm going to 

00:03:05.329 --> 00:03:09.200
 leave a few of cris for here is worth 

00:03:07.670 --> 00:03:12.769
 so you take a look at the 

00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:15.079
 different combinations that can be 

00:03:12.769 --> 00:03:17.450
 can do with this trick and nothing else 

00:03:15.079 --> 00:03:21.010
 I hope you liked it and a greeting 

00:03:17.450 --> 00:03:21.010
 and until the next video 

00:03:21.210 --> 00:03:26.680

00:03:23.990 --> 00:03:26.680
 Y 

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:13.000
 Y 

00:04:35.940 --> 00:04:38.510
 two
