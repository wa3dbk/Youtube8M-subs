tiro<00:00:17.890> today's<00:00:18.730> tutorial<00:00:19.090> Thursday<00:00:19.390> is<00:00:19.960> going

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:20.020 
tiro today's tutorial Thursday is going

00:00:20.020 --> 00:00:23.249 
tiro today's tutorial Thursday is going
to<00:00:20.200> be<00:00:20.320> on<00:00:20.529> a<00:00:20.560> concept<00:00:21.160> called<00:00:21.730> catchin<00:00:22.540> wave

00:00:23.249 --> 00:00:23.259 
to be on a concept called catchin wave

00:00:23.259 --> 00:00:25.710 
to be on a concept called catchin wave
so<00:00:23.770> something<00:00:24.490> really<00:00:24.520> quick<00:00:24.970> really<00:00:25.390> easy

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:25.720 
so something really quick really easy

00:00:25.720 --> 00:00:28.380 
so something really quick really easy
but<00:00:26.439> can<00:00:26.740> be<00:00:26.830> applied<00:00:27.189> in<00:00:27.430> multiple<00:00:28.180> ways<00:00:28.359> of

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:28.390 
but can be applied in multiple ways of

00:00:28.390 --> 00:00:30.120 
but can be applied in multiple ways of
your<00:00:28.660> freestyle<00:00:29.109> to<00:00:29.260> make<00:00:29.439> it<00:00:29.560> really<00:00:29.890> cool

00:00:30.120 --> 00:00:30.130 
your freestyle to make it really cool

00:00:30.130 --> 00:00:32.339 
your freestyle to make it really cool
and<00:00:30.340> diverse<00:00:31.000> so<00:00:31.390> this<00:00:31.539> freestyle<00:00:31.990> is<00:00:32.140> under

00:00:32.339 --> 00:00:32.349 
and diverse so this freestyle is under

00:00:32.349 --> 00:00:33.990 
and diverse so this freestyle is under
the<00:00:32.439> assumption<00:00:32.830> you<00:00:32.890> know<00:00:33.040> how<00:00:33.220> to<00:00:33.280> wave<00:00:33.610> and

00:00:33.990 --> 00:00:34.000 
the assumption you know how to wave and

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:35.460 
the assumption you know how to wave and
today<00:00:34.300> we're<00:00:34.510> just<00:00:34.629> going<00:00:34.780> to<00:00:34.840> use<00:00:34.900> examples

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:35.470 
today we're just going to use examples

00:00:35.470 --> 00:00:38.100 
today we're just going to use examples
of<00:00:35.680> simple<00:00:36.489> kind<00:00:36.730> of<00:00:36.820> arm<00:00:37.150> waves<00:00:37.420> and<00:00:37.780> body

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:38.110 
of simple kind of arm waves and body

00:00:38.110 --> 00:00:41.220 
of simple kind of arm waves and body
waves<00:00:38.530> so<00:00:39.190> the<00:00:39.309> concept<00:00:39.850> is<00:00:39.970> you<00:00:40.480> have<00:00:40.900> this

00:00:41.220 --> 00:00:41.230 
waves so the concept is you have this

00:00:41.230 --> 00:00:45.270 
waves so the concept is you have this
ball<00:00:41.710> this<00:00:42.399> ball<00:00:42.700> of<00:00:42.969> energy<00:00:43.620> and<00:00:44.620> right<00:00:45.100> when

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:45.280 
ball this ball of energy and right when

00:00:45.280 --> 00:00:46.860 
ball this ball of energy and right when
it<00:00:45.370> flows<00:00:45.610> through<00:00:45.640> your<00:00:45.910> body<00:00:45.969> it's<00:00:46.629> going<00:00:46.809> to

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:46.870 
it flows through your body it's going to

00:00:46.870 --> 00:00:49.790 
it flows through your body it's going to
wave<00:00:47.110> so<00:00:47.559> for<00:00:48.309> example<00:00:48.789> if<00:00:48.910> I'm<00:00:49.090> holding<00:00:49.480> my

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:49.800 
wave so for example if I'm holding my

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:52.049 
wave so for example if I'm holding my
waving<00:00:50.800> ball<00:00:51.010> of<00:00:51.190> energy<00:00:51.550> right<00:00:51.700> here<00:00:51.789> I'm

00:00:52.049 --> 00:00:52.059 
waving ball of energy right here I'm

00:00:52.059 --> 00:00:54.720 
waving ball of energy right here I'm
going<00:00:52.180> to<00:00:52.239> toss<00:00:52.510> it<00:00:52.719> up<00:00:52.809> in<00:00:53.530> the<00:00:54.219> air<00:00:54.340> and<00:00:54.550> I'm

00:00:54.720 --> 00:00:54.730 
going to toss it up in the air and I'm

00:00:54.730 --> 00:00:56.100 
going to toss it up in the air and I'm
going<00:00:54.940> to<00:00:54.969> actually<00:00:55.239> look<00:00:55.449> it<00:00:55.629> up<00:00:55.719> it<00:00:56.020> creates

00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:56.110 
going to actually look it up it creates

00:00:56.110 --> 00:00:58.889 
going to actually look it up it creates
the<00:00:56.350> animation<00:00:56.920> effect<00:00:57.250> that's<00:00:58.090> up<00:00:58.300> there<00:00:58.539> I'm

00:00:58.889 --> 00:00:58.899 
the animation effect that's up there I'm

00:00:58.899 --> 00:01:01.250 
the animation effect that's up there I'm
gonna<00:00:59.140> do<00:00:59.199> a<00:00:59.230> quick<00:00:59.590> grab<00:00:59.860> my<00:01:00.100> left<00:01:00.309> hand<00:01:00.640> pop

effect what we're going to do is we're
going<00:01:19.060> to<00:01:19.149> hit<00:01:19.420> after<00:01:20.050> we<00:01:20.800> end<00:01:21.069> that<00:01:21.399> way<00:01:21.729> so

00:01:21.779 --> 00:01:21.789 
going to hit after we end that way so

00:01:21.789 --> 00:01:25.589 
going to hit after we end that way so
for<00:01:22.479> example<00:01:22.990> toss<00:01:23.800> that<00:01:24.039> up<00:01:24.250> grab<00:01:25.000> I'm<00:01:25.450> going
