is<00:00:32.730> not<00:00:32.850> what<00:00:32.910> I'm<00:00:33.270> going<00:00:33.480> to<00:00:33.540> do<00:00:33.690> I<00:00:33.870> heard<00:00:34.530> a

00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:34.800 
is not what I'm going to do I heard a

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:36.799 
is not what I'm going to do I heard a
technique<00:00:35.399> about<00:00:35.700> where<00:00:36.000> people<00:00:36.270> use<00:00:36.420> a<00:00:36.450> pen

00:00:36.799 --> 00:00:36.809 
technique about where people use a pen

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:40.340 
technique about where people use a pen
to<00:00:37.530> impression<00:00:38.399> the<00:00:38.760> lock<00:00:38.969> and<00:00:39.120> open<00:00:39.270> it<00:00:39.600> and<00:00:40.230> I

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:40.350 
to impression the lock and open it and I

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:41.840 
to impression the lock and open it and I
tried<00:00:40.379> it<00:00:40.800> with<00:00:40.950> a<00:00:40.980> few<00:00:41.190> pens<00:00:41.430> and<00:00:41.610> I<00:00:41.670> couldn't

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:41.850 
tried it with a few pens and I couldn't

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:44.030 
tried it with a few pens and I couldn't
get<00:00:41.969> it<00:00:42.120> to<00:00:42.210> open<00:00:42.270> so<00:00:43.230> I<00:00:43.260> was<00:00:43.559> thinking<00:00:43.739> of

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:44.040 
get it to open so I was thinking of

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:45.889 
get it to open so I was thinking of
another<00:00:44.219> way<00:00:44.430> to<00:00:44.489> do<00:00:44.730> it<00:00:44.910> and<00:00:45.090> I<00:00:45.539> fiddled

00:00:45.889 --> 00:00:45.899 
another way to do it and I fiddled

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:47.450 
another way to do it and I fiddled
around<00:00:46.079> with<00:00:46.289> it<00:00:46.469> for<00:00:46.500> two<00:00:46.770> hours<00:00:46.950> and<00:00:47.309> then<00:00:47.370> I

00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:47.460 
around with it for two hours and then I

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:49.670 
around with it for two hours and then I
came<00:00:47.700> up<00:00:47.879> with<00:00:47.910> the<00:00:48.809> right<00:00:48.960> solution<00:00:49.500> and<00:00:49.649> that

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:49.680 
came up with the right solution and that

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:53.750 
came up with the right solution and that
is<00:00:49.890> use<00:00:50.460> the<00:00:50.940> cartoon<00:00:51.660> of<00:00:51.870> a<00:00:52.350> roll<00:00:52.829> of<00:00:52.980> toilet

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:53.760 
is use the cartoon of a roll of toilet

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:57.110 
is use the cartoon of a roll of toilet
paper<00:00:53.969> as<00:00:54.600> a<00:00:55.260> tool<00:00:55.559> so<00:00:56.340> what<00:00:56.489> you<00:00:56.610> actually<00:00:56.760> do

00:00:57.110 --> 00:00:57.120 
paper as a tool so what you actually do

00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:12.200 
paper as a tool so what you actually do
is<00:00:57.329> you<00:00:58.520> you<00:00:59.520> cut<00:00:59.789> out<00:00:59.820> a<00:00:59.940> piece<00:01:00.149> of<00:01:00.329> this<00:01:00.600> part

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:12.210 

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:15.090 

then<00:01:13.210> you<00:01:13.420> roll<00:01:13.780> it<00:01:13.930> around<00:01:14.050> a<00:01:14.560> pen<00:01:14.920> or

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:15.100 
then you roll it around a pen or

00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:16.560 
then you roll it around a pen or
something<00:01:15.460> around<00:01:15.550> so<00:01:16.030> that<00:01:16.060> you<00:01:16.210> get<00:01:16.420> this

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:16.570 
something around so that you get this

00:01:16.570 --> 00:01:20.580 
something around so that you get this
nice<00:01:16.840> actually<00:01:17.800> your<00:01:18.130> miniaturizing<00:01:19.590> the

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:20.590 
nice actually your miniaturizing the

00:01:20.590 --> 00:01:23.550 
nice actually your miniaturizing the
roll<00:01:20.770> of<00:01:20.800> toilet<00:01:21.070> paper<00:01:22.140> so<00:01:23.140> you<00:01:23.170> turn<00:01:23.440> it

00:01:23.550 --> 00:01:23.560 
roll of toilet paper so you turn it

00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:26.100 
roll of toilet paper so you turn it
around<00:01:23.650> a<00:01:23.890> pen<00:01:24.130> then<00:01:24.910> what<00:01:25.360> you<00:01:25.510> do<00:01:25.630> is<00:01:25.660> you

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:26.110 
around a pen then what you do is you

00:01:26.110 --> 00:01:28.740 
around a pen then what you do is you
keep<00:01:26.350> it<00:01:26.440> in<00:01:26.500> place<00:01:26.770> with<00:01:27.190> some<00:01:27.490> tape<00:01:27.730> and<00:01:28.000> for
