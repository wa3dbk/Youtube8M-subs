00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:50.160 
start off I think this is just around a

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:52.160 
start off I think this is just around a
minor<00:00:50.430> or<00:00:50.850> G<00:00:51.059> major<00:00:51.270> whatever<00:00:51.690> mode<00:00:51.870> you<00:00:52.020> want

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:52.170 
minor or G major whatever mode you want

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:59.150 
minor or G major whatever mode you want
to<00:00:52.260> call<00:00:54.050> then<00:00:55.050> it<00:00:55.170> goes<00:00:55.350> into<00:00:57.260> the<00:00:58.260> triplet
