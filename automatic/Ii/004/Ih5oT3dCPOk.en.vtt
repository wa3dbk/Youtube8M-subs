00:00:04.900 --> 00:00:09.790
 Hello everyone, today we visit my 

00:00:07.630 --> 00:00:11.080
 brother alexander during his last visit 

00:00:09.790 --> 00:00:13.690
 taught me to cook 

00:00:11.080 --> 00:00:15.760
 leaven for homemade bread and run out 

00:00:13.690 --> 00:00:18.369
 homemade bread met by art 

00:00:15.760 --> 00:00:22.599
 homemade cookies than you will please us 

00:00:18.369 --> 00:00:25.929
 this year this year probably I will please 

00:00:22.599 --> 00:00:29.109
 so that I will teach you to cook some 

00:00:25.929 --> 00:00:31.150
 Asian dishes but they will be so 

00:00:29.109 --> 00:00:34.510
 a little europe zero van and probably 

00:00:31.150 --> 00:00:36.579
 taste but still founds asian 

00:00:34.510 --> 00:00:39.370
 well, except for Asian something 

00:00:36.579 --> 00:00:41.740
 Oleg will be interesting, well, you know, we 

00:00:39.370 --> 00:00:44.350
 we live in a city in which virtually no 

00:00:41.740 --> 00:00:46.390
 time no matter what the last time me 

00:00:44.350 --> 00:00:49.120
 began to interest dishes that 

00:00:46.390 --> 00:00:52.750
 prepare so to speak with a minimum 

00:00:49.120 --> 00:00:56.560
 the participation of the cook that is put forgot on 

00:00:52.750 --> 00:00:59.140
 some time later came back yes and goals 

00:00:56.560 --> 00:01:02.590
 ate let's try to cook 

00:00:59.140 --> 00:01:06.280
 potato pillow dish is prepared 

00:01:02.590 --> 00:01:08.740
 thus it has taken it as a bow 

00:01:06.280 --> 00:01:12.040
 will fulfill our role 

00:01:08.740 --> 00:01:12.640
 pillow dish is cooked to a minimum 

00:01:12.040 --> 00:01:16.090
 on fire 

00:01:12.640 --> 00:01:17.460
 that is, every master or mistress is not 

00:01:16.090 --> 00:01:19.990
 I know. 

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:23.040
 the minimum of which can be cooked then 

00:01:19.990 --> 00:01:25.450
 I have my brother's one there 

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:28.000
 probably dvoechka will be because he 

00:01:25.450 --> 00:01:33.000
 we will prepare many divisions on 

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:35.470
 cast iron pan because it is better and for 

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:38.280
 heat capacity why is it like 

00:01:35.470 --> 00:01:40.180
 volume will give us warmth around 

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:43.300
 basically not cast iron 

00:01:40.180 --> 00:01:47.350
 dishes like panicking dishes set 

00:01:43.300 --> 00:01:49.480
 I put the fire on the dyadochku that is to us 

00:01:47.350 --> 00:01:51.670
 not even necessarily there especially 

00:01:49.480 --> 00:01:54.340
 heat the oil so that it is ours there 

00:01:51.670 --> 00:01:56.770
 tucked in there or did something to the prism 

00:01:54.340 --> 00:01:57.490
 just iced up with oil pan just 

00:01:56.770 --> 00:02:02.080
 laid 

00:01:57.490 --> 00:02:07.450
 pillow and sound is what we will have and flavor 

00:02:02.080 --> 00:02:10.810
 and some such laying here we are 

00:02:07.450 --> 00:02:14.500
 take potatoes for silence like this 

00:02:10.810 --> 00:02:19.570
 the spirit but I liked the fact that this dish 

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:20.770
 you can cook as I said without such 

00:02:19.570 --> 00:02:25.090
 active participation 

00:02:20.770 --> 00:02:27.970
 that is, our task is to put a close and 

00:02:25.090 --> 00:02:30.160
 on a small fire this dish will be 

00:02:27.970 --> 00:02:33.090
 get ready for about half an hour there 

00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:35.739
 is 40 minutes, even I think that 

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:37.870
 more time for this dish 

00:02:35.739 --> 00:02:40.239
 don't fly that is she is preparing on 

00:02:37.870 --> 00:02:42.870
 little fire and it turns out so very 

00:02:40.239 --> 00:02:45.430
 fragrantly steamed 

00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:51.610
 potatoes with onion, that is, it will not 

00:02:45.430 --> 00:02:54.160
 fried pain more pro guy this dish 

00:02:51.610 --> 00:02:55.420
 it turns out very tasty we put 

00:02:54.160 --> 00:02:58.239
 potatoes on top 

00:02:55.420 --> 00:03:00.700
 onions we will add a little bit a bit and but 

00:02:58.239 --> 00:03:03.100
 This is done for every taste and it may 

00:03:00.700 --> 00:03:05.709
 add if anyone wants peppers there 

00:03:03.100 --> 00:03:08.230
 it tastes and close the lid then 

00:03:05.709 --> 00:03:09.910
 there is a close and leave just 

00:03:08.230 --> 00:03:12.910
 forget about this product 

00:03:09.910 --> 00:03:14.799
 when the product will pull you with the scent 

00:03:12.910 --> 00:03:15.400
 cooked dishes you can to him 

00:03:14.799 --> 00:03:18.690
 return 

00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:21.840
 Well, that's what we got apparently 

00:03:18.690 --> 00:03:24.640
 the cushion was soft and I slept longer 

00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:27.220
 necessary but 

00:03:24.640 --> 00:03:29.410
 in principle, we have not burned anything for 

00:03:27.220 --> 00:03:31.959
 this time, on the contrary, turned out funny 

00:03:29.410 --> 00:03:39.180
 What kind of gifts I think not whose 

00:03:31.959 --> 00:03:39.180
 may even like it delicious
