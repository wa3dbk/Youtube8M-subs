00:00:47.019 --> 00:00:50.019
 liquid 

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:50.140
 we have our mold ready 

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:58.670
 we cut the muffins into pieces 

00:01:54.950 --> 00:02:02.800
 finite and with them we will cover the 

00:01:58.670 --> 00:02:02.800
 mold of our calatrava bread 

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:12.910
 we put the cut cupcakes on 

00:02:09.650 --> 00:02:16.900
 the bottom of the caramelized mold 

00:02:12.910 --> 00:02:20.680
 pressing well to compact 

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:24.340
 and trying to cover the entire background 

00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:27.200
 share with a spoon 

00:02:24.340 --> 00:02:30.400
 with very clean hands 

00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:30.400
 covering over him 

00:02:33.580 --> 00:02:37.320
 and filling in the spaces 

00:02:47.319 --> 00:02:53.099
 next we jump the eggs 

00:03:08.870 --> 00:03:13.239
 and 5 large eggs and cats 

00:03:15.060 --> 00:03:19.260
 we can use some rods to 

00:03:17.130 --> 00:03:21.950
 explained 

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:21.950
 a manual 

00:03:26.600 --> 00:03:30.350
 and we keep beating 

00:03:36.340 --> 00:03:40.909
 daddy 

00:03:38.430 --> 00:03:40.909
 fondly 

00:03:43.480 --> 00:03:51.849
 200 grams of sugar as well we had 

00:03:45.909 --> 00:03:53.720
 said when we add the liquid a 

00:03:51.849 --> 00:03:56.530
 trickle 

00:03:53.720 --> 00:04:00.030
 another trickle 

00:03:56.530 --> 00:04:00.030
 we mix some rods 

00:04:01.300 --> 00:04:06.660
 and then pour the milk 

00:04:07.670 --> 00:04:12.510
 mixing 

00:04:10.060 --> 00:04:12.510
 cautious 

00:04:17.950 --> 00:04:25.370
 natural healthy traditional 

00:04:22.460 --> 00:04:28.880
 and very very very easy to reach 

00:04:25.370 --> 00:04:32.500
 everyone that's why I like it 

00:04:28.880 --> 00:04:35.770
 of anyone with all the ingredients 

00:04:32.500 --> 00:04:38.530
 affordable we have a daily fridge 

00:04:35.770 --> 00:04:40.260

00:04:38.530 --> 00:04:43.800
 delicious 

00:04:40.260 --> 00:04:46.770
 the mix when we see that everything is 

00:04:43.800 --> 00:04:49.400
 well integrated it would be ready to pour 

00:04:46.770 --> 00:04:52.270

00:04:52.330 --> 00:04:58.379
 and pour the mixture obtained in the 

00:04:54.939 --> 00:04:58.379
 caramelized mold 

00:05:05.540 --> 00:05:13.840
 We put the mold in our bathroom Mary 

00:05:08.300 --> 00:05:13.840
 with the oven preheated to 180 degrees 

00:05:43.600 --> 00:05:46.920
 and we already have our 

00:06:04.520 --> 00:06:09.160

00:06:06.400 --> 00:06:12.000
