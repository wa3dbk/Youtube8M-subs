at this thing it is a modded sword and

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:28.670 
at this thing it is a modded sword and
you<00:01:27.450> could<00:01:27.600> probably<00:01:27.780> take<00:01:28.170> this<00:01:28.380> ender

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:28.680 
you could probably take this ender

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:30.679 
you could probably take this ender
dragon<00:01:29.040> out<00:01:29.130> and<00:01:29.400> probably<00:01:29.640> like<00:01:30.000> 10<00:01:30.390> minutes

00:01:30.679 --> 00:01:30.689 
dragon out and probably like 10 minutes

00:01:30.689 --> 00:01:32.359 
dragon out and probably like 10 minutes
or<00:01:30.810> less<00:01:31.020> maybe<00:01:31.560> even<00:01:31.920> less<00:01:32.070> than<00:01:32.189> that

00:01:32.359 --> 00:01:32.369 
or less maybe even less than that

00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:33.380 
or less maybe even less than that
because<00:01:32.460> you<00:01:32.549> could<00:01:32.790> probably<00:01:33.000> take<00:01:33.240> the

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:33.390 
because you could probably take the

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:34.850 
because you could probably take the
normal<00:01:33.689> one<00:01:33.780> out<00:01:33.930> in<00:01:34.020> ten<00:01:34.200> minutes<00:01:34.229> to<00:01:34.530> life

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:34.860 
normal one out in ten minutes to life

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:36.859 
normal one out in ten minutes to life
so<00:01:35.130> basically<00:01:35.579> this<00:01:35.939> one<00:01:36.180> could<00:01:36.360> probably<00:01:36.630> be

00:01:36.859 --> 00:01:36.869 
so basically this one could probably be

00:01:36.869 --> 00:01:38.749 
so basically this one could probably be
done<00:01:37.049> in<00:01:37.200> maybe<00:01:37.380> like<00:01:37.619> five<00:01:38.009> minutes<00:01:38.280> or<00:01:38.490> so<00:01:38.670> if

00:01:38.749 --> 00:01:38.759 
done in maybe like five minutes or so if

00:01:38.759 --> 00:01:40.550 
done in maybe like five minutes or so if
you're<00:01:38.909> really<00:01:39.210> rushing<00:01:39.630> to<00:01:39.720> do<00:01:39.869> it<00:01:39.990> but<00:01:40.380> as

00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:40.560 
you're really rushing to do it but as

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:41.960 
you're really rushing to do it but as
you<00:01:40.710> can<00:01:40.829> tell<00:01:40.890> we<00:01:41.189> are<00:01:41.280> literally<00:01:41.579> about<00:01:41.820> to

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:41.970 
you can tell we are literally about to

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:43.490 
you can tell we are literally about to
slay<00:01:42.149> this<00:01:42.299> thing<00:01:42.509> one<00:01:42.869> more<00:01:43.079> trip<00:01:43.290> down<00:01:43.470> here

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:43.500 
slay this thing one more trip down here

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:45.380 
slay this thing one more trip down here
yeah<00:01:44.100> we<00:01:44.280> should<00:01:44.490> probably<00:01:44.820> take<00:01:45.149> him<00:01:45.240> out

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:45.390 
yeah we should probably take him out

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:46.910 
yeah we should probably take him out
right<00:01:45.570> here<00:01:45.750> we're<00:01:46.110> to<00:01:46.170> go<00:01:46.259> ahead<00:01:46.439> hit<00:01:46.740> him<00:01:46.860> a

00:01:46.910 --> 00:01:46.920 
right here we're to go ahead hit him a

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:48.620 
right here we're to go ahead hit him a
few<00:01:47.100> more<00:01:47.189> times<00:01:47.250> dismiss<00:01:47.969> the<00:01:48.060> few<00:01:48.240> hits<00:01:48.390> and

00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:48.630 
few more times dismiss the few hits and

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:52.340 
few more times dismiss the few hits and
here<00:01:49.409> we<00:01:49.530> go<00:01:49.740> boom<00:01:50.460> just<00:01:50.969> like<00:01:51.149> that<00:01:51.540> the<00:01:51.780> cool

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:54.570
