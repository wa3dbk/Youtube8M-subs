kind<00:01:09.060> of<00:01:09.119> pry<00:01:09.330> it<00:01:09.390> into<00:01:09.630> position<00:01:09.750> and<00:01:10.670> we<00:01:11.670> want

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:11.850 
kind of pry it into position and we want

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:13.310 
kind of pry it into position and we want
to<00:01:11.909> make<00:01:12.000> that<00:01:12.119> setup<00:01:12.479> for<00:01:12.720> both<00:01:12.750> sides<00:01:13.080> of<00:01:13.260> the

00:01:13.789 --> 00:01:13.799 
vehicle

00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:15.469 
vehicle
and<00:01:14.100> then<00:01:14.909> we<00:01:14.970> can<00:01:15.060> go<00:01:15.119> ahead<00:01:15.180> and<00:01:15.330> put<00:01:15.420> the

00:01:15.469 --> 00:01:15.479 
and then we can go ahead and put the

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:17.090 
and then we can go ahead and put the
hitch<00:01:15.570> up<00:01:15.630> into<00:01:15.900> place<00:01:16.080> it's<00:01:16.740> probably<00:01:16.979> going

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:17.100 
hitch up into place it's probably going

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:18.649 
hitch up into place it's probably going
to<00:01:17.159> take<00:01:17.250> a<00:01:17.280> second<00:01:17.610> set<00:01:17.729> of<00:01:17.759> hands<00:01:17.970> somebody's

00:01:18.649 --> 00:01:18.659 
to take a second set of hands somebody's

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:19.789 
to take a second set of hands somebody's
going<00:01:18.780> to<00:01:18.810> need<00:01:18.869> to<00:01:19.049> hold<00:01:19.200> the<00:01:19.380> handle<00:01:19.680> that

00:01:19.789 --> 00:01:19.799 
going to need to hold the handle that

00:01:19.799 --> 00:01:21.620 
going to need to hold the handle that
into<00:01:19.979> position<00:01:20.100> another<00:01:21.090> person<00:01:21.420> will<00:01:21.509> need

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:21.630 
into position another person will need

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:22.969 
into position another person will need
to<00:01:21.750> put<00:01:22.049> the<00:01:22.110> hitch<00:01:22.229> up<00:01:22.409> and<00:01:22.530> thread<00:01:22.740> them<00:01:22.830> in

00:01:22.969 --> 00:01:22.979 
to put the hitch up and thread them in

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:24.920 
to put the hitch up and thread them in
the<00:01:23.430> next<00:01:23.640> step<00:01:23.820> is<00:01:23.970> going<00:01:24.090> to<00:01:24.150> be<00:01:24.240> to<00:01:24.540> swing

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:24.930 
the next step is going to be to swing

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:27.170 
the next step is going to be to swing
the<00:01:25.020> hitch<00:01:25.140> up<00:01:25.350> into<00:01:25.470> position<00:01:26.189> basically

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:27.180 
the hitch up into position basically

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:28.580 
the hitch up into position basically
where<00:01:27.270> it<00:01:27.360> looks<00:01:27.540> level<00:01:27.810> on<00:01:27.900> the<00:01:27.990> vehicle<00:01:28.350> in

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:28.590 
where it looks level on the vehicle in

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:30.530 
where it looks level on the vehicle in
some<00:01:28.860> instances<00:01:29.340> the<00:01:29.520> exhaust<00:01:30.060> will<00:01:30.270> actually

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:30.540 
some instances the exhaust will actually

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:32.210 
some instances the exhaust will actually
prevent<00:01:31.229> you<00:01:31.290> from<00:01:31.439> getting<00:01:31.770> it<00:01:31.860> perfectly

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:32.220 
prevent you from getting it perfectly

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:34.310 
prevent you from getting it perfectly
level<00:01:32.390> so<00:01:33.390> what<00:01:33.540> we're<00:01:33.659> going<00:01:33.750> to<00:01:33.810> do<00:01:33.960> is<00:01:34.110> to<00:01:34.200> go

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:34.320 
level so what we're going to do is to go

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:37.249 
level so what we're going to do is to go
ahead<00:01:34.380> and<00:01:34.710> loosen<00:01:35.700> the<00:01:35.970> two<00:01:36.450> bolts<00:01:36.659> here<00:01:37.110> on

ahead and loosen the two bolts here on

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:39.289 
ahead and loosen the two bolts here on
the<00:01:37.650> exhaust<00:01:37.920> and<00:01:38.250> that'll<00:01:38.790> allow<00:01:38.820> us<00:01:38.970> to<00:01:39.180> have

00:01:39.289 --> 00:01:39.299 
the exhaust and that'll allow us to have

00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:41.510 
the exhaust and that'll allow us to have
a<00:01:39.329> little<00:01:39.540> more<00:01:39.630> room<00:01:39.900> there<00:01:40.079> to<00:01:40.290> move<00:01:40.740> that<00:01:40.979> we

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:41.520 
a little more room there to move that we

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:43.100 
a little more room there to move that we
can<00:01:41.670> go<00:01:41.759> ahead<00:01:41.850> swing<00:01:42.570> the<00:01:42.689> hitch<00:01:42.810> up<00:01:42.960> into
