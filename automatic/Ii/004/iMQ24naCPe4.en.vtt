00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:21.680 
thickness is okay so what happens when a

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:29.830 
thickness is okay so what happens when a
fish<00:02:21.950> bites<00:02:23.860> hook<00:02:24.860> this<00:02:25.040> up<00:02:25.220> real<00:02:25.430> quick<00:02:28.840> it's

00:02:29.830 --> 00:02:29.840 
fish bites hook this up real quick it's

00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:32.520 
fish bites hook this up real quick it's
hard<00:02:30.020> to<00:02:30.080> do<00:02:30.230> on<00:02:30.380> the<00:02:30.470> dry<00:02:30.650> worm<00:02:30.920> I'm<00:02:31.190> dry<00:02:31.400> tube

00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:32.530 
hard to do on the dry worm I'm dry tube

00:02:32.530 --> 00:02:35.740 
hard to do on the dry worm I'm dry tube
anyway<00:02:33.790> so<00:02:34.790> what<00:02:34.910> happens<00:02:35.209> when<00:02:35.330> a<00:02:35.360> fish<00:02:35.720> bites

00:02:35.740 --> 00:02:35.750 
anyway so what happens when a fish bites

00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:39.430 
anyway so what happens when a fish bites
on<00:02:36.290> this<00:02:36.650> tube<00:02:36.980> on<00:02:37.250> any<00:02:37.610> worm<00:02:37.910> is<00:02:38.570> it<00:02:38.840> bites<00:02:39.110> and

00:02:39.430 --> 00:02:39.440 
on this tube on any worm is it bites and

00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:40.900 
on this tube on any worm is it bites and
that<00:02:39.709> tube<00:02:39.980> has<00:02:40.160> got<00:02:40.310> to<00:02:40.430> get<00:02:40.550> out<00:02:40.670> of<00:02:40.760> the<00:02:40.820> way

00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:40.910 
that tube has got to get out of the way

00:02:40.910 --> 00:02:42.280 
that tube has got to get out of the way
the<00:02:41.120> worms<00:02:41.390> got<00:02:41.600> to<00:02:41.720> get<00:02:41.840> out<00:02:41.959> of<00:02:42.050> the<00:02:42.140> way<00:02:42.230> and

00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:42.290 
the worms got to get out of the way and

00:02:42.290 --> 00:02:43.870 
the worms got to get out of the way and
you've<00:02:42.470> got<00:02:42.650> to<00:02:42.770> have<00:02:42.950> a<00:02:43.190> business<00:02:43.370> end<00:02:43.730> of<00:02:43.819> the

00:02:43.870 --> 00:02:43.880 
you've got to have a business end of the

00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:49.680 
you've got to have a business end of the
point<00:02:44.150> if<00:02:44.570> you<00:02:44.630> use<00:02:44.840> too<00:02:45.020> small<00:02:45.320> of<00:02:45.350> a<00:02:45.530> hook

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:49.690 

00:02:49.690 --> 00:02:52.900

00:02:52.900 --> 00:02:52.910 
say for instance a to hook this is all

00:02:52.910 --> 00:02:54.640 
say for instance a to hook this is all
this<00:02:53.150> is<00:02:53.300> also<00:02:53.450> a<00:02:53.630> wide<00:02:53.870> gap<00:02:54.110> but<00:02:54.290> it's<00:02:54.410> a<00:02:54.500> too

00:02:54.640 --> 00:02:54.650 
this is also a wide gap but it's a too

00:02:54.650 --> 00:03:04.780 
this is also a wide gap but it's a too
wide<00:02:55.040> yet<00:02:57.250> okay<00:03:02.950> not<00:03:03.950> a<00:03:03.980> whole<00:03:04.280> lot<00:03:04.489> of<00:03:04.519> bite

00:03:11.860 --> 00:03:11.870 
to use a two on hook for that thick worm

00:03:11.870 --> 00:03:19.690 
to use a two on hook for that thick worm
I'm<00:03:12.320> not<00:03:12.739> going<00:03:12.980> to<00:03:13.040> use<00:03:13.310> a<00:03:18.220> I'm<00:03:19.220> not<00:03:19.459> going<00:03:19.640> to

I'm not going to use a I'm not going to

00:03:19.700 --> 00:03:24.720 
I'm not going to use a I'm not going to
use<00:03:19.820> an<00:03:19.940> offset<00:03:20.120> hook<00:03:20.570> for<00:03:20.810> the<00:03:20.900> same<00:03:21.110> reason

00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:24.730 

00:03:24.730 --> 00:03:27.069 

the<00:03:25.730> same<00:03:25.760> reason<00:03:26.000> I'm<00:03:26.480> looking<00:03:26.750> to<00:03:26.810> use<00:03:26.930> that

00:03:27.069 --> 00:03:27.079 
the same reason I'm looking to use that

00:03:27.079 --> 00:03:29.440 
the same reason I'm looking to use that
offset<00:03:27.670> squishes<00:03:28.670> down<00:03:28.850> there's<00:03:29.090> not<00:03:29.239> gonna

00:03:29.440 --> 00:03:29.450 
offset squishes down there's not gonna

00:03:29.450 --> 00:03:46.780 
offset squishes down there's not gonna
be<00:03:29.540> a<00:03:29.660> lot<00:03:30.049> of<00:03:30.079> room<00:03:30.290> you<00:03:30.650> know<00:03:44.380> super<00:03:45.790> super

00:03:46.780 --> 00:03:46.790 
be a lot of room you know super super

00:03:46.790 --> 00:03:49.780 
be a lot of room you know super super
fluke<00:03:47.000> has<00:03:47.150> this<00:03:47.329> nice<00:03:47.630> little<00:03:47.660> slip<00:03:48.260> okay<00:03:49.220> so

00:03:49.780 --> 00:03:49.790 
fluke has this nice little slip okay so

00:03:49.790 --> 00:03:52.030 
fluke has this nice little slip okay so
in<00:03:49.940> essence<00:03:50.360> the<00:03:50.959> thickness<00:03:51.410> of<00:03:51.560> that<00:03:51.739> soft

00:03:52.030 --> 00:03:52.040 
in essence the thickness of that soft

00:03:52.040 --> 00:03:54.130 
in essence the thickness of that soft
plastic<00:03:52.579> is<00:03:52.940> only<00:03:53.180> as<00:03:53.360> thick<00:03:53.600> as<00:03:53.780> from<00:03:53.989> the

00:03:54.130 --> 00:03:54.140 
plastic is only as thick as from the

00:03:54.140 --> 00:03:56.949 
plastic is only as thick as from the
very<00:03:55.040> inside<00:03:55.610> of<00:03:55.730> that<00:03:55.820> slit<00:03:56.209> to<00:03:56.420> the<00:03:56.510> back<00:03:56.690> so

00:03:56.949 --> 00:03:56.959 
very inside of that slit to the back so

00:03:56.959 --> 00:04:00.520 
very inside of that slit to the back so
it's<00:03:57.110> only<00:03:57.230> about<00:03:57.380> and<00:03:59.019> so<00:04:00.019> when<00:04:00.200> you<00:04:00.320> run<00:04:00.500> a

00:04:00.520 --> 00:04:00.530 
it's only about and so when you run a

00:04:00.530 --> 00:04:06.150 
it's only about and so when you run a
hook<00:04:00.829> into<00:04:01.070> it

00:04:06.150 --> 00:04:06.160 

00:04:06.160 --> 00:04:11.200 

and<00:04:07.160> the<00:04:07.460> fish<00:04:07.670> bites<00:04:09.700> that's<00:04:10.700> how<00:04:10.850> much<00:04:11.000> bite

00:04:11.200 --> 00:04:11.210 
and the fish bites that's how much bite

00:04:11.210 --> 00:04:14.740 
and the fish bites that's how much bite
you<00:04:11.390> have<00:04:11.570> okay<00:04:12.340> that's<00:04:13.340> plenty<00:04:13.610> that's<00:04:14.480> why<00:04:14.720> I

00:04:14.740 --> 00:04:14.750 
you have okay that's plenty that's why I

00:04:14.750 --> 00:04:17.410 
you have okay that's plenty that's why I
use<00:04:15.110> a<00:04:15.140> wide<00:04:15.459> bin<00:04:16.459> because<00:04:16.670> I<00:04:16.850> get<00:04:16.970> a<00:04:17.000> better<00:04:17.209> or

00:04:17.410 --> 00:04:17.420 
use a wide bin because I get a better or

00:04:17.420 --> 00:04:19.330 
use a wide bin because I get a better or
I'm<00:04:17.660> bad<00:04:17.840> offset<00:04:18.260> because<00:04:18.709> I<00:04:18.950> get<00:04:19.100> a<00:04:19.130> better

00:04:19.330 --> 00:04:19.340 
I'm bad offset because I get a better

00:04:19.340 --> 00:04:22.950 
I'm bad offset because I get a better
hook<00:04:19.519> set<00:04:20.920> um

00:04:22.950 --> 00:04:22.960 
hook set um

00:04:22.960 --> 00:04:26.410

but it worked see got that much bite now
a<00:05:32.990> whole<00:05:33.200> lot<00:05:33.380> of<00:05:33.470> bite<00:05:33.650> is<00:05:33.980> a<00:05:34.010> little<00:05:34.280> risky

00:05:35.610 --> 00:05:35.620 
a whole lot of bite is a little risky

a whole lot of bite is a little risky
smaller<00:05:36.620> the<00:05:36.800> hook<00:05:37.120> the<00:05:38.120> more<00:05:38.390> action<00:05:39.260> you<00:05:39.350> get

00:05:39.520 --> 00:05:39.530 
smaller the hook the more action you get

00:05:39.530 --> 00:05:43.810 
smaller the hook the more action you get
now<00:05:40.160> you<00:05:40.730> got<00:05:40.880> to<00:05:40.970> also<00:05:41.120> consider<00:05:42.280> the<00:05:43.280> the

00:05:43.810 --> 00:05:43.820 
now you got to also consider the the

00:05:43.820 --> 00:05:45.250 
now you got to also consider the the
gauge<00:05:44.030> of<00:05:44.180> the<00:05:44.240> wire<00:05:44.300> that<00:05:44.690> the<00:05:44.780> hook<00:05:44.930> is<00:05:45.050> made

00:05:45.250 --> 00:05:45.260 
gauge of the wire that the hook is made

00:05:45.260 --> 00:05:46.650 
gauge of the wire that the hook is made
out<00:05:45.440> of

00:05:46.650 --> 00:05:46.660 
out of

00:05:46.660 --> 00:06:01.869 
out of
for<00:05:47.660> instance<00:05:48.020> my<00:05:48.740> two<00:05:48.800> hook<00:05:54.370> hook

00:06:01.869 --> 00:06:01.879 

00:06:01.879 --> 00:06:04.029 

before<00:06:02.689> a<00:06:02.719> hook<00:06:02.929> is<00:06:03.080> considerably<00:06:03.679> thicker

00:06:04.029 --> 00:06:04.039 
before a hook is considerably thicker

00:06:04.039 --> 00:06:06.790 
before a hook is considerably thicker
engaged<00:06:04.610> wire<00:06:05.149> gauge<00:06:05.479> than<00:06:05.899> that<00:06:06.139> to<00:06:06.319> on<00:06:06.529> hook

00:06:57.820 --> 00:06:57.830 
wire hook I'm gonna go with a medium

00:06:57.830 --> 00:07:02.469 
wire hook I'm gonna go with a medium
action<00:06:58.219> rod<00:06:58.929> and<00:06:59.929> and<00:07:00.919> you<00:07:01.819> know<00:07:01.939> and<00:07:02.149> then

action rod and and you know and then

00:07:02.479 --> 00:07:03.699 
action rod and and you know and then
with<00:07:02.629> that<00:07:02.719> medium<00:07:02.990> action<00:07:03.139> rod<00:07:03.409> I'm<00:07:03.529> gonna<00:07:03.649> go

00:07:03.709 --> 00:07:05.169 
with that medium action rod I'm gonna go
with<00:07:03.860> lighter<00:07:04.039> line<00:07:04.279> because<00:07:04.519> it's<00:07:04.669> just<00:07:04.819> the

00:07:05.169 --> 00:07:05.179 
with lighter line because it's just the

00:07:05.179 --> 00:07:08.199 
with lighter line because it's just the
line<00:07:05.360> matches<00:07:05.779> the<00:07:05.899> rod<00:07:06.050> anyway<00:07:06.939> that's<00:07:07.939> it

00:07:08.199 --> 00:07:08.209 
line matches the rod anyway that's it

00:07:08.209 --> 00:07:11.939 
line matches the rod anyway that's it
that's<00:07:09.079> a<00:07:09.379> that's<00:07:09.949> how<00:07:10.099> I<00:07:10.219> choose<00:07:10.689> you<00:07:11.689> know
