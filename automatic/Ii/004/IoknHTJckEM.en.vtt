science<00:00:28.160> is<00:00:28.340> magic<00:00:28.730> what<00:00:28.880> we<00:00:29.000> learned<00:00:29.240> how<00:00:29.390> to

00:00:29.410 --> 00:00:29.420 
science is magic what we learned how to

duplicate<00:00:29.960> magic<00:00:30.830> is<00:00:30.949> science<00:00:31.130> but<00:00:31.490> still<00:00:31.730> has

00:00:31.960 --> 00:00:31.970 
duplicate magic is science but still has

00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:33.370 
duplicate magic is science but still has
two<00:00:32.180> mystery<00:00:32.540> that<00:00:32.810> is<00:00:32.840> the<00:00:32.960> only<00:00:33.170> difference

releasing a string mixing the

00:02:20.570 --> 00:02:21.820 
releasing a string mixing the
ingredients<00:02:20.600> we<00:02:21.230> have<00:02:21.260> what<00:02:21.470> we<00:02:21.560> call<00:02:21.680> the

00:02:21.820 --> 00:02:21.830 
ingredients we have what we call the

00:02:21.830 --> 00:02:22.990 
ingredients we have what we call the
exothermic<00:02:22.340> reaction

00:02:22.990 --> 00:02:23.000 
exothermic reaction

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:29.590 
exothermic reaction
everyone<00:02:23.450> say<00:02:23.600> exothermic<00:02:24.260> reaction<00:02:28.330> hot

00:02:29.590 --> 00:02:29.600 
everyone say exothermic reaction hot

00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:31.450 
everyone say exothermic reaction hot
this<00:02:30.170> makes<00:02:30.410> the<00:02:30.470> smoking<00:02:30.830> no<00:02:30.950> steaming<00:02:31.310> but

00:02:31.450 --> 00:02:31.460 
this makes the smoking no steaming but

00:02:31.460 --> 00:02:33.220 
this makes the smoking no steaming but
we<00:02:31.580> call<00:02:31.700> a<00:02:31.730> genie<00:02:31.970> now<00:02:32.330> many<00:02:32.570> years<00:02:32.660> ago<00:02:32.990> a<00:02:33.020> man
