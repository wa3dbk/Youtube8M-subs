down so I'll make this one come down to

00:01:45.299 --> 00:01:47.569 
down so I'll make this one come down to
this<00:01:45.899> line<00:01:46.140> kind<00:01:46.409> of<00:01:46.470> goes<00:01:46.619> up<00:01:46.829> so<00:01:47.340> I'll<00:01:47.460> make

00:01:47.569 --> 00:01:47.579 
this line kind of goes up so I'll make

00:01:47.579 --> 00:01:48.899 
this line kind of goes up so I'll make
this<00:01:47.759> one<00:01:47.939> go<00:01:48.149> up<00:01:48.360> a<00:01:48.509> bit

00:03:46.860 --> 00:03:49.340 
this way and it's gonna come just
twisting<00:03:47.310> around<00:03:47.430> your<00:03:48.150> tree<00:03:48.570> can<00:03:48.930> look<00:03:49.110> any

00:03:49.340 --> 00:03:49.350 
twisting around your tree can look any

00:03:49.350 --> 00:03:52.130 
twisting around your tree can look any
way<00:03:49.830> at<00:03:50.010> all<00:03:50.130> because<00:03:50.880> that's<00:03:51.210> the<00:03:51.840> beauty<00:03:52.110> of

00:03:52.130 --> 00:03:52.140 
way at all because that's the beauty of

00:03:52.140 --> 00:03:54.680 
way at all because that's the beauty of
a<00:03:52.260> tree<00:03:52.640> but<00:03:53.640> the<00:03:53.760> idea<00:03:54.060> is<00:03:54.150> that<00:03:54.240> it<00:03:54.510> gets

00:03:54.680 --> 00:03:54.690 
a tree but the idea is that it gets

00:03:54.690 --> 00:03:57.470 
a tree but the idea is that it gets
skinny<00:03:54.990> at<00:03:55.170> the<00:03:55.350> ends<00:03:55.650> and<00:03:55.860> as<00:03:56.760> it<00:03:57.000> comes<00:03:57.210> back

00:03:57.470 --> 00:03:57.480 
skinny at the ends and as it comes back

00:03:57.480 --> 00:03:59.720 
skinny at the ends and as it comes back
in<00:03:57.750> towards<00:03:58.320> the<00:03:58.410> trunk<00:03:58.770> it's<00:03:59.250> a<00:03:59.370> little<00:03:59.580> bit

00:03:59.720 --> 00:03:59.730 
in towards the trunk it's a little bit

00:03:59.730 --> 00:04:02.420 
in towards the trunk it's a little bit
thicker<00:04:00.000> and<00:04:00.840> another<00:04:01.530> branch<00:04:01.860> here<00:04:02.280> this

00:04:02.420 --> 00:04:02.430 
thicker and another branch here this

00:04:02.430 --> 00:04:04.240 
thicker and another branch here this
one's<00:04:02.610> going<00:04:02.760> to<00:04:02.850> go<00:04:03.030> behind<00:04:03.240> the<00:04:03.600> house<00:04:03.840> a<00:04:03.870> bit

00:04:04.240 --> 00:04:04.250 
one's going to go behind the house a bit

00:04:04.250 --> 00:04:06.650 
one's going to go behind the house a bit
since<00:04:05.250> it's<00:04:05.490> growing<00:04:05.880> in<00:04:06.000> this<00:04:06.150> direction

00:04:06.650 --> 00:04:06.660 
since it's growing in this direction

00:04:06.660 --> 00:04:09.830 
since it's growing in this direction
here<00:04:07.110> and<00:04:07.340> another<00:04:08.340> branch<00:04:08.760> again<00:04:09.360> coming<00:04:09.750> in

00:04:09.830 --> 00:04:09.840 
here and another branch again coming in

00:04:09.840 --> 00:04:12.620 
here and another branch again coming in
behind<00:04:10.170> the<00:04:10.350> house<00:04:10.530> and<00:04:11.180> make<00:04:12.180> some<00:04:12.450> little

00:04:12.620 --> 00:04:12.630 
behind the house and make some little

00:04:12.630 --> 00:04:15.440 
behind the house and make some little
branches<00:04:13.170> coming<00:04:13.530> up<00:04:13.700> if<00:04:14.700> you<00:04:15.090> find<00:04:15.300> them

00:04:15.440 --> 00:04:15.450 
branches coming up if you find them

00:04:15.450 --> 00:04:16.460 
branches coming up if you find them
going<00:04:15.630> too<00:04:15.870> fast

00:04:16.460 --> 00:04:16.470 
going too fast

00:04:16.470 --> 00:04:19.370 
going too fast
the<00:04:16.650> best<00:04:16.950> thing<00:04:17.130> to<00:04:17.160> do<00:04:17.489> is<00:04:17.730> just<00:04:18.330> pause<00:04:19.200> the

00:04:19.370 --> 00:04:19.380 
the best thing to do is just pause the

00:04:19.380 --> 00:04:23.150 
the best thing to do is just pause the
video<00:04:20.000> or<00:04:21.000> turn<00:04:21.450> the<00:04:21.600> sound<00:04:21.780> off<00:04:22.019> and<00:04:22.410> choose

00:04:23.150 --> 00:04:23.160 
video or turn the sound off and choose

00:04:23.160 --> 00:04:25.160 
video or turn the sound off and choose
the<00:04:23.400> slow<00:04:23.610> down<00:04:23.730> feature<00:04:24.000> because<00:04:24.750> YouTube

00:04:25.160 --> 00:04:25.170 
the slow down feature because YouTube

00:04:25.170 --> 00:04:26.690 
the slow down feature because YouTube
has<00:04:25.200> this<00:04:25.650> feature<00:04:25.890> where<00:04:26.130> you<00:04:26.220> can<00:04:26.370> slow

00:04:26.690 --> 00:04:26.700 
has this feature where you can slow

00:04:26.700 --> 00:04:28.790 
has this feature where you can slow
things<00:04:26.970> down<00:04:27.090> and<00:04:27.540> then<00:04:28.290> you<00:04:28.410> don't<00:04:28.560> have<00:04:28.740> to

00:04:28.790 --> 00:04:28.800 
things down and then you don't have to

00:04:28.800 --> 00:04:32.330 
things down and then you don't have to
go<00:04:29.040> as<00:04:29.190> fast<00:04:29.520> as<00:04:29.700> I'm<00:04:29.850> going<00:04:31.040> but<00:04:32.040> it's<00:04:32.160> a<00:04:32.190> good

00:04:32.330 --> 00:04:32.340 
go as fast as I'm going but it's a good

00:04:32.340 --> 00:04:34.040 
go as fast as I'm going but it's a good
idea<00:04:32.460> to<00:04:32.700> watch<00:04:32.850> the<00:04:33.120> whole<00:04:33.270> video<00:04:33.390> first<00:04:33.840> and

00:04:34.040 --> 00:04:34.050 
idea to watch the whole video first and

00:04:34.050 --> 00:04:36.070 
idea to watch the whole video first and
then<00:04:34.200> come<00:04:34.440> back<00:04:34.470> and<00:04:34.919> draw<00:04:35.310> along<00:04:35.610> with<00:04:35.790> me

00:04:36.070 --> 00:04:36.080 
then come back and draw along with me

00:04:36.080 --> 00:04:38.810 
then come back and draw along with me
alright<00:04:37.080> so<00:04:37.290> here<00:04:37.500> I<00:04:37.530> have<00:04:37.620> my<00:04:37.950> creepy<00:04:38.310> tree<00:04:38.460> my

00:04:43.909 --> 00:04:43.919 
wanted you could also put maybe a

00:04:43.919 --> 00:04:45.500

jack-o'-lantern down here I have a

00:04:45.510 --> 00:04:47.600 
jack-o'-lantern down here I have a
tutorial<00:04:45.960> on<00:04:46.380> how<00:04:46.500> to<00:04:46.530> draw<00:04:46.770> jack-o'-lanterns

tutorial on how to draw jack-o'-lanterns

00:04:47.610 --> 00:04:49.130 
tutorial on how to draw jack-o'-lanterns
but<00:04:47.790> I'm<00:04:48.000> just<00:04:48.150> going<00:04:48.360> to<00:04:48.390> draw<00:04:48.600> a<00:04:48.630> very<00:04:48.840> basic

00:04:49.130 --> 00:04:49.140 
but I'm just going to draw a very basic

00:04:49.140 --> 00:04:51.620 
but I'm just going to draw a very basic
one<00:04:49.500> here<00:04:49.919> which<00:04:50.340> is<00:04:50.490> just<00:04:50.880> going<00:04:51.090> to<00:04:51.210> be<00:04:51.360> a

00:04:51.620 --> 00:04:51.630 
one here which is just going to be a

00:04:51.630 --> 00:04:53.960 
one here which is just going to be a
pumpkin<00:04:52.410> shape<00:04:52.650> which<00:04:52.890> is<00:04:52.919> kind<00:04:53.700> of<00:04:53.790> like<00:04:53.940> a

00:04:53.960 --> 00:04:53.970 
pumpkin shape which is kind of like a

00:04:53.970 --> 00:04:56.930 
pumpkin shape which is kind of like a
heart<00:04:54.270> and<00:04:54.570> then<00:04:55.440> I'll<00:04:55.860> put<00:04:56.100> in<00:04:56.280> some<00:04:56.760> eyes

00:04:56.930 --> 00:04:56.940 
heart and then I'll put in some eyes

00:04:56.940 --> 00:05:02.030 
heart and then I'll put in some eyes
here<00:04:57.900> and<00:04:58.580> maybe<00:04:59.580> an<00:04:59.790> open<00:05:00.210> round<00:05:00.360> mouth<00:05:01.040> and

00:05:02.030 --> 00:05:02.040 
here and maybe an open round mouth and

00:05:02.040 --> 00:05:03.210 
here and maybe an open round mouth and
the<00:05:02.190> top

00:05:03.210 --> 00:05:03.220 
the top

00:05:03.220 --> 00:05:05.190 
the top
and<00:05:03.340> if<00:05:04.030> you<00:05:04.120> also<00:05:04.300> wanted<00:05:04.720> you<00:05:04.870> could<00:05:05.020> draw

00:05:05.190 --> 00:05:05.200 
and if you also wanted you could draw

00:05:05.200 --> 00:05:08.160 
and if you also wanted you could draw
some<00:05:05.530> bats<00:05:05.890> going<00:05:06.220> across<00:05:06.550> the<00:05:06.880> moon<00:05:07.060> so<00:05:07.750> to

00:05:08.160 --> 00:05:08.170 
some bats going across the moon so to

00:05:08.170 --> 00:05:10.080 
some bats going across the moon so to
make<00:05:08.290> a<00:05:08.320> bet<00:05:08.620> you're<00:05:09.280> just<00:05:09.520> going<00:05:09.760> to<00:05:09.790> draw

00:05:10.080 --> 00:05:10.090 
make a bet you're just going to draw

00:05:10.090 --> 00:05:12.540 
make a bet you're just going to draw
sort<00:05:10.480> of<00:05:10.600> the<00:05:10.900> shape<00:05:11.350> of<00:05:11.380> a<00:05:11.620> cat's<00:05:11.890> head<00:05:12.250> like

00:05:12.540 --> 00:05:12.550 
sort of the shape of a cat's head like

00:05:12.550 --> 00:05:16.110 
sort of the shape of a cat's head like
this<00:05:12.880> and<00:05:13.300> then<00:05:14.230> some<00:05:14.530> wings<00:05:14.860> that<00:05:15.430> would<00:05:15.640> flop

00:05:16.110 --> 00:05:16.120 
this and then some wings that would flop

00:05:16.120 --> 00:05:19.200 
this and then some wings that would flop
it<00:05:16.330> like<00:05:16.540> this<00:05:16.810> and<00:05:17.550> then<00:05:18.550> of<00:05:18.670> course<00:05:18.700> bats

00:05:19.200 --> 00:05:19.210 
it like this and then of course bats

00:05:19.210 --> 00:05:23.430 
it like this and then of course bats
wings<00:05:19.540> have<00:05:21.030> points<00:05:22.030> at<00:05:22.150> the<00:05:22.240> bottom<00:05:22.440> like

00:05:23.430 --> 00:05:23.440 
wings have points at the bottom like

00:05:23.440 --> 00:05:26.880 
wings have points at the bottom like
this<00:05:23.710> and<00:05:24.070> then<00:05:24.250> a<00:05:24.280> bat<00:05:24.550> body<00:05:24.880> on<00:05:25.330> the<00:05:25.540> top<00:05:25.890> so

00:05:26.880 --> 00:05:26.890 
this and then a bat body on the top so

00:05:26.890 --> 00:05:28.800 
this and then a bat body on the top so
that's<00:05:27.640> all<00:05:27.880> you<00:05:28.000> really<00:05:28.210> need<00:05:28.450> to<00:05:28.480> draw<00:05:28.750> a

00:05:28.800 --> 00:05:28.810 
that's all you really need to draw a

00:05:28.810 --> 00:05:30.810 
that's all you really need to draw a
haunted<00:05:29.320> house<00:05:29.500> and<00:05:29.800> what<00:05:30.400> we're<00:05:30.490> going<00:05:30.580> to<00:05:30.640> do

00:05:30.810 --> 00:05:30.820 
haunted house and what we're going to do

00:05:30.820 --> 00:05:32.580 
haunted house and what we're going to do
now<00:05:30.970> is<00:05:31.240> outline<00:05:31.690> the<00:05:31.840> whole<00:05:32.050> thing<00:05:32.290> in<00:05:32.410> black

00:05:32.580 --> 00:05:32.590 
now is outline the whole thing in black

00:05:32.590 --> 00:05:35.130 
now is outline the whole thing in black
and<00:05:33.130> we're<00:05:33.940> going<00:05:34.060> to<00:05:34.090> color<00:05:34.300> in<00:05:34.540> most<00:05:34.780> of<00:05:34.960> this

00:05:35.130 --> 00:05:35.140 
and we're going to color in most of this

00:05:35.140 --> 00:05:37.890 
and we're going to color in most of this
in<00:05:35.410> black<00:05:36.100> the<00:05:36.430> bat<00:05:36.670> and<00:05:37.030> the<00:05:37.480> house<00:05:37.690> itself
