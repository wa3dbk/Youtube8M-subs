 You can market it because it's

 find more on their own if you 're not going to 

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:23.609

00:00:29.850 --> 00:00:33.720
 good the ingredients as to occupy 

00:00:31.770 --> 00:00:37.170
 to make yourself more and more butter 

00:00:33.720 --> 00:00:39.780
 cocoa almond oil I have 

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:41.370
 vegetable oil each occupies the one 

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:43.500
 have available and that is better 

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:46.230
 quality better benefits 

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:48.180
 I know one that is a macerated that says of 

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:50.580
 carrot with his passion is to have this the 

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:53.040
 recipe that has apart lots of of 

00:00:50.580 --> 00:00:55.050
 determined properties etc too 

00:00:53.040 --> 00:00:56.820
 let's occupy honey optional vitamin e 

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:58.410
 and to give it the color we will occupy 

00:00:56.820 --> 00:01:01.500
 dye are left in the store 

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:03.870
 pastries that are to give color to 

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:06.300
 chocolate these are going to dissolve in the 

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:08.280
 in the oil the dyes of 

00:01:06.300 --> 00:01:11.250
 that they sell in supermarkets to 

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:12.720
 color the cookies the process is 

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:15.390
 very simple first thing we're going to do 

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:19.770
 is to grab all the parts thanks to the 

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:22.890
 cocoa butter wax bees those three 

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:25.590
 components and we will take it to bathroom 

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:29.490
 Mary this has to be removed and if 

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:32.729
 has to unify the bathroom very well 

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:35.310
 marÃ­a simmered so that of 

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:37.649
 suddenly do not splash water from the pot 

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:41.270
 inside the product once it is said 

00:01:37.649 --> 00:01:44.299
 shipping completely what we do is 

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:47.210
 add our teaspoon of honey and 

00:01:44.299 --> 00:01:49.570
 we started to stir until it 

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:52.729
 unifique are going to look like a few droplets 

00:01:49.570 --> 00:01:57.229
 but as they are cooling you go 

00:01:52.729 --> 00:01:58.729
 As a genizar, everyone has to 

00:01:57.229 --> 00:02:02.600
 remove it from the fire so that it 

00:01:58.729 --> 00:02:05.060
 cool a little bit and when it was used 

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:08.000
 well already directly if we are going to 

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:10.580
 occupy without color directly what 

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:13.459
 We place in the container of our 

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:15.110
 lip balm this recipe is for 

00:02:13.459 --> 00:02:17.540
 make the bars you do not have to have 

00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:20.299
 this type of packaging because if they occupy 

00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:24.290
 three pot-type containers are not going to 

00:02:20.299 --> 00:02:26.920
 spend very difficult to get it good in the 

00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:29.870
 if you want to add color 

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:32.780
 simply to the same base that has 

00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:34.489
 to be melted you add a little 

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:37.220
 of the coloring you want 

00:02:34.489 --> 00:02:39.110
 a little red the truth that the idea is 

00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:43.069
 that is not to say do not overdo it anymore 

00:02:39.110 --> 00:02:45.709
 over 10% with the color and the other 

00:02:43.069 --> 00:02:47.280
 that the oil have to be careful 

00:02:45.709 --> 00:02:49.350
 of not heating the microwave 

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:50.819
 the base because also what is going on 

00:02:49.350 --> 00:02:52.590
 time will be studied then if 

00:02:50.819 --> 00:02:54.840
 they have to reheat the always to the bathroom 

00:02:52.590 --> 00:02:58.620
 Maria, because that's where you can 

00:02:54.840 --> 00:03:00.270
 suddenly boil almost the oil and let's 

00:02:58.620 --> 00:03:03.060
 have the problem even with the containers 

00:03:00.270 --> 00:03:05.819
 that can deform us and well that 's 

00:03:03.060 --> 00:03:07.770
 the recipe I hope you enjoy it and that 

00:03:05.819 --> 00:03:10.880
 explain them so we'll see each other in the 

00:03:07.770 --> 00:03:10.880
 probability that is very good
