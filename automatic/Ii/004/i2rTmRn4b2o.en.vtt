 jorge barrÃ³n cepeda lechera guadalajara 

00:00:03.210 --> 00:00:08.370
 and he held the position of general manager is 

00:00:06.809 --> 00:00:11.940
 very important is vital for us 

00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:14.700
 have a good service a service 

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:16.619
 quality towards the consumer and we try 

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:18.330
 always have a chance to get there 

00:00:16.619 --> 00:00:19.859
 to the market in the times in which 

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:21.720
 is requiring the product because 

00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:24.300
 we must give security to our 

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:26.910
 distribution as I said to get 

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:29.939
 in a timely manner to the centers 

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:33.030
 distribution that is a safe vehicle 

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:35.300
 that is also responding to our 

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:38.440
 needs of people charged 

00:00:35.300 --> 00:00:41.210
 and have an operation economically 

00:00:38.440 --> 00:00:43.550
 party or have we been the course of 

00:00:41.210 --> 00:00:45.559
 time buying buying trucks 

00:00:43.550 --> 00:00:48.410
 different capacities that has been 

00:00:45.559 --> 00:00:50.360
 difficult at the time to adapt to 

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:53.059
 growth to the development of routes and 

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:55.220
 with the isuzu we have met 

00:00:53.059 --> 00:00:58.489
 that the capabilities they are offering 

00:00:55.220 --> 00:01:00.930
 They adapt very well for each stage of the 

00:00:58.489 --> 00:01:04.460
 development that we are taking 

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:04.460
 and our work routes 

00:01:04.909 --> 00:01:08.569
 well we had references that it is a 

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:11.749
 vehicle that precisely adapts to 

00:01:08.569 --> 00:01:15.439
 the load needs of companies 

00:01:11.749 --> 00:01:17.869
 and that you have a very good response 

00:01:15.439 --> 00:01:21.380
 find the maintenance masters 

00:01:17.869 --> 00:01:24.109
 of parts and parts after having 

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:25.700
 an isuzu vehicle to test we were 

00:01:24.109 --> 00:01:28.880
 analyzing their yields 

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:31.039
 fuel their maneuvers in the city 

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:33.979
 in the distribution centers in the 

00:01:31.039 --> 00:01:36.020
 points of sale and we saw that it was very 

00:01:33.979 --> 00:01:38.030
 reliable the vehicle that fitted 

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:39.950
 very good for our needs and 

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:42.200
 also the operators feel very 

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:44.539
 happy because it allows them in 

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:47.000
 narrow streets makes a few maneuvers with 

00:01:44.539 --> 00:01:48.970
 ease they plan their 

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:51.280
 tours 

00:01:48.970 --> 00:01:53.350
 They give a very good visibility to 

00:01:51.280 --> 00:01:57.010
 driver at the time of being circulating 

00:01:53.350 --> 00:01:58.810
 when we have had failures that imply 

00:01:57.010 --> 00:02:01.900
 that the truck arrives late to its routes to 

00:01:58.810 --> 00:02:03.610
 their destinations and that is already a 

00:02:01.900 --> 00:02:05.560
 satisfaction the guarantee that they will 

00:02:03.610 --> 00:02:06.850
 be always arriving in the workers in 

00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:10.479
 what is required to do our 

00:02:06.850 --> 00:02:12.460
 work is trusted and you want 

00:02:10.479 --> 00:02:16.090
 get security to give a good 

00:02:12.460 --> 00:02:19.120
 service to customers 

00:02:16.090 --> 00:02:22.209
 It is the best alternative because 

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:23.130
 economically it represents a very good 

00:02:22.209 --> 00:02:26.300
 option 

00:02:23.130 --> 00:02:29.640
 make a profitable job 

00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:32.060
 definitely if I would recommend them to 

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:32.060
 the walkers
