00:04:35.129 --> 00:04:35.139 
there it is a bit more tumbled you know

00:04:35.139 --> 00:04:36.779 
there it is a bit more tumbled you know
if<00:04:35.229> anything<00:04:35.470> that<00:04:35.830> these<00:04:36.070> these<00:04:36.400> shoes<00:04:36.610> they

00:04:36.779 --> 00:04:36.789 
if anything that these these shoes they

00:04:36.789 --> 00:04:38.400 
if anything that these these shoes they
they<00:04:37.120> probably<00:04:37.330> resemble<00:04:37.840> the<00:04:37.930> most<00:04:38.139> out<00:04:38.380> of

00:04:38.400 --> 00:04:38.410 
they probably resemble the most out of

00:04:38.410 --> 00:04:39.659 
they probably resemble the most out of
all<00:04:38.560> the<00:04:38.680> other<00:04:38.860> Jordan<00:04:39.160> fibers<00:04:39.400> that<00:04:39.490> are<00:04:39.610> out

00:04:39.659 --> 00:04:39.669 
all the other Jordan fibers that are out

00:04:39.669 --> 00:04:45.830 
all the other Jordan fibers that are out
there<00:04:43.830> actually<00:04:44.830> move<00:04:44.950> these<00:04:45.130> out<00:04:45.370> the<00:04:45.520> weight

00:04:45.830 --> 00:04:45.840 
there actually move these out the weight

00:04:45.840 --> 00:04:48.480 
there actually move these out the weight
so<00:04:46.840> in<00:04:47.200> my<00:04:47.320> opinion<00:04:47.740> I<00:04:47.889> think<00:04:47.919> this<00:04:48.190> shoe<00:04:48.340> is<00:04:48.400> a

00:04:48.480 --> 00:04:48.490 
so in my opinion I think this shoe is a

00:04:48.490 --> 00:04:51.300 
so in my opinion I think this shoe is a
good<00:04:48.849> cop<00:04:49.120> if<00:04:49.360> you<00:04:49.539> can<00:04:49.720> get<00:04:49.900> them<00:04:50.020> for<00:04:50.380> less

00:04:51.300 --> 00:04:51.310 
good cop if you can get them for less

00:04:51.310 --> 00:04:54.180
