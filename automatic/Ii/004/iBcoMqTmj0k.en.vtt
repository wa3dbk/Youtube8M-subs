this is what the bottles say your hair
starting<00:01:42.210> point<00:01:42.450> is<00:01:42.600> curly<00:01:42.990> so<00:01:43.940> the<00:01:44.940> way<00:01:45.120> the

00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:45.510 
starting point is curly so the way the

00:01:45.510 --> 00:01:47.810 
starting point is curly so the way the
curly<00:01:45.750> hair<00:01:45.870> grows<00:01:46.380> it<00:01:46.650> twists<00:01:47.190> and<00:01:47.310> turns<00:01:47.520> so

curly hair grows it twists and turns so

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:49.400 
curly hair grows it twists and turns so
it<00:01:48.060> makes<00:01:48.240> it<00:01:48.360> difficult<00:01:48.570> to<00:01:48.990> tame<00:01:49.230> and

it makes it difficult to tame and
straighten<00:01:50.030> and<00:01:51.030> this<00:01:51.570> has<00:01:51.840> a<00:01:51.870> micro

00:01:52.730 --> 00:01:52.740

like this you know but I honestly I

00:03:39.150 --> 00:03:40.310 
like this you know but I honestly I
think<00:03:39.270> that<00:03:39.600> you<00:03:39.660> could<00:03:39.810> just<00:03:39.989> buy<00:03:40.110> a<00:03:40.140> regular

Pantene<00:03:40.920> you<00:03:41.040> probably<00:03:41.340> do<00:03:41.550> the<00:03:41.670> same<00:03:41.880> thing

00:03:42.110 --> 00:03:42.120 
Pantene you probably do the same thing

00:03:42.120 --> 00:03:44.540 
Pantene you probably do the same thing
because<00:03:42.780> they<00:03:43.080> think<00:03:43.290> their<00:03:43.739> products<00:03:44.250> are

00:03:44.540 --> 00:03:44.550 
because they think their products are

00:03:44.550 --> 00:03:47.599 
because they think their products are
pretty<00:03:45.320> much<00:03:46.320> the<00:03:46.560> same<00:03:46.590> I<00:03:47.040> really<00:03:47.459> don't

00:03:47.599 --> 00:03:47.609 
pretty much the same I really don't

00:03:47.609 --> 00:03:49.069 
pretty much the same I really don't
think<00:03:47.670> there's<00:03:47.940> anything<00:03:48.150> I<00:03:48.420> really<00:03:48.780> should

00:03:49.069 --> 00:03:49.079 
think there's anything I really should

00:03:49.079 --> 00:03:51.140 
think there's anything I really should
look<00:03:49.769> at<00:03:49.920> the<00:03:50.040> ingredients<00:03:50.609> I<00:03:50.700> don't<00:03:50.910> have<00:03:51.030> the

00:03:51.140 --> 00:03:51.150 
look at the ingredients I don't have the

00:03:51.150 --> 00:03:53.090 
look at the ingredients I don't have the
regular<00:03:51.510> Pantene<00:03:51.930> bottle<00:03:52.350> but<00:03:52.530> if<00:03:52.620> I<00:03:52.739> did<00:03:52.950> I'd

00:03:53.090 --> 00:03:53.100 
regular Pantene bottle but if I did I'd

00:03:53.100 --> 00:03:55.130 
regular Pantene bottle but if I did I'd
probably<00:03:53.310> compare<00:03:53.820> the<00:03:53.940> ingredients<00:03:54.540> just<00:03:54.660> to

00:03:55.130 --> 00:03:55.140 
probably compare the ingredients just to

00:03:55.140 --> 00:03:57.680 
probably compare the ingredients just to
see<00:03:55.670> that's<00:03:56.670> what<00:03:56.820> I<00:03:56.850> would<00:03:57.090> do<00:03:57.180> if<00:03:57.299> I<00:03:57.420> were<00:03:57.570> you

00:03:57.680 --> 00:03:57.690 
see that's what I would do if I were you

00:03:57.690 --> 00:03:59.630 
see that's what I would do if I were you
I<00:03:57.870> would<00:03:58.230> go<00:03:58.380> to<00:03:58.440> the<00:03:58.650> store<00:03:58.859> and<00:03:59.070> just<00:03:59.250> take<00:03:59.459> a

00:03:59.630 --> 00:03:59.640 
I would go to the store and just take a

00:03:59.640 --> 00:04:02.270 
I would go to the store and just take a
regular<00:03:59.850> Pantene<00:04:00.510> you<00:04:00.810> know<00:04:00.930> bottle<00:04:01.920> and<00:04:02.070> then

00:04:02.270 --> 00:04:02.280 
regular Pantene you know bottle and then

00:04:02.280 --> 00:04:04.160 
regular Pantene you know bottle and then
take<00:04:02.579> this<00:04:02.790> curly<00:04:03.150> hair<00:04:03.299> series<00:04:03.690> bottle<00:04:03.989> and

00:04:04.160 --> 00:04:04.170 
take this curly hair series bottle and

00:04:04.170 --> 00:04:05.690 
take this curly hair series bottle and
see<00:04:04.320> if<00:04:04.410> there's<00:04:04.590> anything<00:04:04.799> different<00:04:05.070> which

00:04:05.690 --> 00:04:05.700 
see if there's anything different which

00:04:05.700 --> 00:04:11.080 
see if there's anything different which
I<00:04:05.850> didn't<00:04:06.120> do<00:04:06.320> but<00:04:07.320> it<00:04:07.500> feels<00:04:07.799> to<00:04:08.220> me<00:04:08.370> the<00:04:08.549> same

00:04:11.080 --> 00:04:11.090 

00:04:11.090 --> 00:04:13.640 

yep<00:04:12.090> that's<00:04:12.540> about<00:04:12.720> it

00:04:13.640 --> 00:04:13.650
