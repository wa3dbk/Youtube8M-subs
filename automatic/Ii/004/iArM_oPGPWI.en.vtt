00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:30.650

00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:33.080 
and I'm just securing it with some bobby
pins<00:02:30.870> I<00:02:31.410> like<00:02:31.920> to<00:02:32.070> place<00:02:32.280> them<00:02:32.520> in<00:02:32.700> an<00:02:32.820> X

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:35.630 
pins I like to place them in an X
because<00:02:33.600> I<00:02:33.630> just<00:02:33.900> find<00:02:34.170> this<00:02:34.920> is<00:02:35.100> the<00:02:35.220> best<00:02:35.430> way

00:02:35.630 --> 00:02:35.640 
because I just find this is the best way

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:48.839
