00:00:13.130 --> 00:00:15.800
 another video of the little fratti series 

00:00:15.170 --> 00:00:19.340
 liars 

00:00:15.800 --> 00:00:21.500
 I then always let myself see this is 

00:00:19.340 --> 00:00:24.410
 your ashley benson cro 

00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:25.760

00:00:24.410 --> 00:00:28.970

00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:37.070
 and in the info box the video of his look is 

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:40.430
 practically a susanna is a lover like 

00:00:37.070 --> 00:00:43.909
 me of this show that I already have you 

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:48.019
 spoken or the other has not even anything about it 

00:00:43.909 --> 00:00:50.120
 we love we love both so madly 

00:00:48.019 --> 00:00:51.110
 we decided to continue this 

00:00:50.120 --> 00:00:52.820
 collaboration together 

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:54.409
 I only regret the first video 

00:00:52.820 --> 00:00:57.729
 I did n't do it in collaboration with 

00:00:54.409 --> 00:00:59.989
 abroad okay now went to see the 

00:00:57.729 --> 00:01:01.670
 video inspired to give her makeup is 

00:00:59.989 --> 00:01:04.100
 blew out and let it be his make-up e 

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:07.750
 hoped I can assure you that a girl 

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:10.490
 tremendously sweet funny witty 

00:01:07.750 --> 00:01:13.190
 solar and is beautiful but I think that already 

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:16.070
 all of you know it and not the 

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:19.070
 this mind I'll make an ashley look 

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:21.560
 benson and find another look 10 

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:23.750
 benson maybe different from mine for not 

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:24.800
 do the same thing and repeat that 

00:01:23.750 --> 00:01:28.250
 look 

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:30.860
 the point is that I found that 

00:01:28.250 --> 00:01:33.170
 however all four ligas or not 

00:01:30.860 --> 00:01:37.190
 They are practically rigged or the year 

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:39.890
 smokey so sorry if it will be a while 

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:42.500
 repetitive I try to find some 

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:44.840
 the looking bit unusual a little different 

00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:48.320
 in addition to black brown or not to have 

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:50.180
 nothing is not that they are rigged then 

00:01:48.320 --> 00:01:51.920
 I tried to find a make up that is 

00:01:50.180 --> 00:01:54.740
 different from the one I made of 

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:57.380
 area in fact I made a smokey this 

00:01:54.740 --> 00:02:01.540
 that to me that photo that I put you both 

00:01:57.380 --> 00:02:01.540
 in the intro and I'll put you now 

00:02:04.550 --> 00:02:10.979
 I don't know if you can appreciate it though 

00:02:07.050 --> 00:02:12.510
 however there is from purple in make up like 

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:18.440
 usual fake these here are 

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:20.970
 namely that stand out are beautiful 

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:23.940
 I think my parents are very excited about it 

00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:26.310
 brown eyes so not seen to say 

00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:29.430
 how the heck is beautiful the confusions 

00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:31.350
 a boy's rhinestones is fantastic that between 

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:34.280
 the other I don't want to talk too much 

00:02:31.350 --> 00:02:36.390
 even though I'm doing it I know him from 

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:39.330
 when she was the daughter of one of the 

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:41.640
 cheap and chic but eastwick witches 

00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:43.230
 the freak and witches of eastwick don't know if 

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:45.000
 I've never seen the anyway I already 

00:02:43.230 --> 00:02:48.120

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:51.720
 huge change in Italy meadows 

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:54.810

00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:57.870

00:02:54.810 --> 00:02:59.100

00:03:10.830 --> 00:03:15.900
 we don't want them to be videos 

00:03:12.630 --> 00:03:18.470
 fao starts by applying a premier on 

00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:18.470
 the whole eyelid 

00:03:20.110 --> 00:03:25.250

00:03:25.250 --> 00:03:27.700
 mobile eyelid 

00:03:32.960 --> 00:03:40.490

00:03:59.040 --> 00:04:06.120
 above the gray to secure it well to the 

00:04:01.890 --> 00:04:09.770
 black pencil and we don't create bent then 

00:04:06.120 --> 00:04:09.770

 I take the purple and apply it below 

00:04:26.570 --> 00:04:28.750
