00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:23.560
 because I was going here - give me your meat and 

00:00:21.009 --> 00:00:26.189
 I want to ask that change with the rest 

00:00:23.560 --> 00:00:26.189
 here we go 

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:37.580
 the state council of the republic of 

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:39.470
 Cuba has decreed official duel with 

00:00:37.580 --> 00:00:41.800
 reason for the death of the partner 

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:41.800
 kimi 

00:00:44.310 --> 00:00:47.810
 and imagine days 

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:58.980
 will not only pass to the partner the time of 

00:00:51.809 --> 00:01:01.470
 There's plenty of time that goes by in this house here 

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:03.660
 it's not happening I was here I lowered the 

00:01:01.470 --> 00:01:05.670
 arepa the amount and with all that is for 

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:07.290
 I had to go fix your tastes good 

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:08.850
 that this thing will one day change the 

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:11.400
 my brother advances story and you can not 

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:13.200
 nothing is eternal stop forever nothing 

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:16.369
 will never last think well that suits you 

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:16.369
 do not go messing 

00:01:20.909 --> 00:01:26.869
 I think it would be the not to think when 

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:29.700
 form the drop if they send me to shoot for 

00:01:26.869 --> 00:01:31.950
 out there those simple agents normal 

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:32.939
 what is in the fight and trying to 

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:35.609
 escape 

00:01:32.939 --> 00:01:38.579
 also think well that here you lose 

00:01:35.609 --> 00:01:41.219
 also she from above sending our 

00:01:38.579 --> 00:01:43.259
 work goes down or will live by force to 

00:01:41.219 --> 00:01:46.079
 a town that is separated from all 

00:01:43.259 --> 00:01:48.030
 that's what I resist if 

00:01:46.079 --> 00:01:50.599
 they wanted more messes to leave for 

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:50.599
 avenge 

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:14.340
 and where does that face come from? 

00:02:11.530 --> 00:02:16.940
 You really hope old 

00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:16.940
 of that
