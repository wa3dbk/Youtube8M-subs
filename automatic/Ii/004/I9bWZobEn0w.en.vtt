 change a few things and the publisher has 

00:02:22.239 --> 00:02:29.079
 decided to move the release date 

00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:31.959
 of my manga at lucca cosplay 2015 

00:02:29.079 --> 00:02:33.700
 so I do not present a rimini comix 

00:02:31.959 --> 00:02:36.549
 this year that it would be in July 

00:02:33.700 --> 00:02:39.370

00:02:39.370 --> 00:02:43.359
 end of November 

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:46.420
 however I will always have my stand at 

00:02:43.359 --> 00:02:48.400
 mix of but I'll find myself in the 

00:02:46.420 --> 00:02:51.340
 senpai manga stand to do 

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:54.129
 obviously the signatures and some dedications 

00:02:51.340 --> 00:02:56.620
 then draw for all those pastries 

00:02:54.129 --> 00:02:59.200
 who ask me if my mango will come out 

00:02:56.620 --> 00:03:00.940
 also in comics and newsstands 

00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:04.989
 unfortunately in these times the comics shops 

00:03:00.940 --> 00:03:07.959
 Italians tend to snub badly i 

00:03:04.989 --> 00:03:11.230
 manga designed to the point by us Italians 

00:03:07.959 --> 00:03:14.049
 not considering it to be technical 

00:03:11.230 --> 00:03:17.739
 come on stage to you if my manga 

00:03:14.049 --> 00:03:20.739
 will receive many many pre-orders 

00:03:17.739 --> 00:03:23.919
 we will have a chance to succeed at 

00:03:20.739 --> 00:03:25.209
 get it into the comics too 

00:03:23.919 --> 00:03:27.599
 Italian 

00:03:25.209 --> 00:03:30.819
 so now my beloved pastries 

00:03:27.599 --> 00:03:33.430
 all depends on you I recommend 

00:03:30.819 --> 00:03:36.069
 let me hear my volume preordered 

00:03:33.430 --> 00:03:38.079
 if you like it of course or go 

00:03:36.069 --> 00:03:40.930
 in the comics requesting the volumes of 

00:03:38.079 --> 00:03:43.419
 manga sempai because the guys are here 

00:03:40.930 --> 00:03:45.599
 we too and that is not why we are 

00:03:43.419 --> 00:03:48.760
 Italians are not capable of drawing 

00:03:45.599 --> 00:03:51.609
 indeed there are a lot of artists and 

00:03:48.760 --> 00:03:53.980
 talented artists who design mangoes 

00:03:51.609 --> 00:03:55.870
 Italians therefore we must try to 

00:03:53.980 --> 00:03:59.799
 unlock the mentality of these 

00:03:55.870 --> 00:04:01.840
 comics to make them open to the world of gods 

00:03:59.799 --> 00:04:03.340
 Italian manga because we are here 

00:04:01.840 --> 00:04:05.470
 we want to be heard 

00:04:03.340 --> 00:04:08.290
