that and my lesson was just like
everybody<00:01:25.439> else<00:01:25.860> but<00:01:26.610> in<00:01:26.759> hindsight<00:01:27.360> that's

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:28.200 
everybody else but in hindsight that's

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:31.880 
everybody else but in hindsight that's
the<00:01:28.619> secret<00:01:29.159> the<00:01:29.670> secret<00:01:29.700> is<00:01:30.450> to<00:01:31.200> treat<00:01:31.650> your

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:31.890 
the secret the secret is to treat your

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:33.910 
the secret the secret is to treat your
children<00:01:32.400> like<00:01:32.610> every<00:01:33.299> other<00:01:33.450> student

00:01:33.910 --> 00:01:33.920 
children like every other student

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:35.990 
children like every other student
because<00:01:34.920> if<00:01:35.159> you<00:01:35.280> try<00:01:35.520> to<00:01:35.579> give<00:01:35.880> them

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:36.000 
because if you try to give them

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:38.840 
because if you try to give them
preferential<00:01:36.479> treatment<00:01:37.110> in<00:01:37.200> any<00:01:37.470> way<00:01:37.850> then

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:38.850 
preferential treatment in any way then

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:41.030 
preferential treatment in any way then
it<00:01:39.090> becomes<00:01:39.390> very<00:01:39.450> difficult<00:01:39.960> to<00:01:40.049> maintain<00:01:40.200> a

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:41.040 
it becomes very difficult to maintain a

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:43.280 
it becomes very difficult to maintain a
unique<00:01:41.579> situation<00:01:41.960> now<00:01:42.960> there<00:01:43.110> could<00:01:43.259> be

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:43.290 
unique situation now there could be

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:45.499 
unique situation now there could be
exceptions<00:01:43.409> to<00:01:44.040> this<00:01:44.159> for<00:01:44.460> example<00:01:44.490> if<00:01:45.299> you

00:01:45.499 --> 00:01:45.509 
exceptions to this for example if you

00:01:45.509 --> 00:01:47.539 
exceptions to this for example if you
have<00:01:45.630> taken<00:01:45.869> the<00:01:46.500> bull<00:01:46.740> by<00:01:46.770> the<00:01:46.920> horns<00:01:47.399> with

00:01:47.539 --> 00:01:47.549 
have taken the bull by the horns with

00:01:47.549 --> 00:01:49.700 
have taken the bull by the horns with
your<00:01:47.670> children<00:01:48.060> and<00:01:48.240> you<00:01:48.540> do<00:01:49.020> homeschooling

structured under your control
maybe<00:01:53.430> indeed<00:01:53.820> you<00:01:53.970> can<00:01:54.210> teach<00:01:54.420> the<00:01:54.630> music<00:01:54.720> if

00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:55.140 
maybe indeed you can teach the music if

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:58.429 
maybe indeed you can teach the music if
it's<00:01:55.590> in<00:01:55.920> your<00:01:56.070> realm<00:01:56.549> of<00:01:56.790> expertise<00:01:57.360> but<00:01:58.259> for

specializing<00:02:27.000> in<00:02:27.030> other<00:02:27.180> instruments

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:27.810 
specializing in other instruments

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:29.360 
specializing in other instruments
although<00:02:28.080> they<00:02:28.560> are<00:02:28.740> both<00:02:28.950> somewhat

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:29.370 
although they are both somewhat

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:31.640 
although they are both somewhat
accomplished<00:02:29.940> on<00:02:30.180> piano<00:02:30.540> but<00:02:31.140> it's<00:02:31.320> not<00:02:31.470> their

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:31.650 
accomplished on piano but it's not their

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:34.550 
accomplished on piano but it's not their
primary<00:02:32.340> instrument<00:02:33.060> and<00:02:33.240> I<00:02:33.630> realized<00:02:34.140> the

00:02:34.550 --> 00:02:34.560 
primary instrument and I realized the

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:36.440 
primary instrument and I realized the
reason<00:02:34.590> was<00:02:35.100> I<00:02:35.340> didn't<00:02:35.790> just<00:02:35.940> structure<00:02:36.360> it

00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:36.450 
reason was I didn't just structure it

00:02:36.450 --> 00:02:38.450 
reason was I didn't just structure it
why<00:02:36.660> did<00:02:36.870> I<00:02:36.990> learn<00:02:37.200> for<00:02:37.410> my<00:02:37.530> father<00:02:37.800> I<00:02:37.950> just<00:02:38.250> I

00:02:38.450 --> 00:02:38.460 
why did I learn for my father I just I

00:02:38.460 --> 00:02:42.500 
why did I learn for my father I just I
didn't<00:02:38.940> understand<00:02:39.660> how<00:02:40.590> the<00:02:41.240> dynamic<00:02:42.240> of<00:02:42.390> how

00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:42.510 
didn't understand how the dynamic of how

00:02:42.510 --> 00:02:45.199 
didn't understand how the dynamic of how
the<00:02:42.960> lessons<00:02:43.350> we<00:02:43.470> had<00:02:43.709> regularly<00:02:44.670> scheduled

00:02:45.199 --> 00:02:45.209 
the lessons we had regularly scheduled

00:02:45.209 --> 00:02:47.570 
the lessons we had regularly scheduled
like<00:02:45.360> everyone<00:02:45.900> else<00:02:46.080> can<00:02:46.380> work<00:02:46.590> so<00:02:47.250> that's

00:02:47.570 --> 00:02:47.580 
like everyone else can work so that's

00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:50.240 
like everyone else can work so that's
the<00:02:47.790> secret<00:02:48.120> now<00:02:48.660> in<00:02:48.900> our<00:02:49.110> household<00:02:49.740> also

00:02:50.240 --> 00:02:50.250 
the secret now in our household also

00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:52.100 
the secret now in our household also
another<00:02:50.550> thing<00:02:50.790> was<00:02:50.970> my<00:02:51.180> father<00:02:51.480> gave<00:02:51.750> me<00:02:51.810> the

00:02:52.100 --> 00:02:52.110 
another thing was my father gave me the

00:02:52.110 --> 00:02:54.920 
another thing was my father gave me the
lessons<00:02:52.670> but<00:02:53.670> my<00:02:53.880> mother<00:02:54.240> was<00:02:54.450> the<00:02:54.600> one<00:02:54.750> who

00:02:54.920 --> 00:02:54.930 
lessons but my mother was the one who

00:02:54.930 --> 00:02:57.110 
lessons but my mother was the one who
you<00:02:55.380> know<00:02:55.410> kind<00:02:55.800> of<00:02:55.890> watched<00:02:56.340> over<00:02:56.610> us<00:02:56.790> and

00:02:57.110 --> 00:02:57.120 
you know kind of watched over us and

00:02:57.120 --> 00:02:58.430 
you know kind of watched over us and
made<00:02:57.270> sure<00:02:57.300> we<00:02:57.450> practiced<00:02:58.080> and<00:02:58.230> all<00:02:58.290> of<00:02:58.410> that

00:02:58.430 --> 00:02:58.440 
made sure we practiced and all of that

00:02:58.440 --> 00:03:00.680 
made sure we practiced and all of that
so<00:02:58.980> my<00:02:59.100> father<00:02:59.310> was<00:02:59.520> completely<00:03:00.390> uninvolved

00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:00.690 
so my father was completely uninvolved

00:03:00.690 --> 00:03:03.110 
so my father was completely uninvolved
in<00:03:01.170> our<00:03:01.260> practicing<00:03:01.920> which<00:03:02.070> is<00:03:02.220> smart<00:03:02.610> because

00:03:03.110 --> 00:03:03.120 
in our practicing which is smart because

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:04.640 
in our practicing which is smart because
if<00:03:03.390> he<00:03:03.510> was<00:03:03.630> right<00:03:03.840> there<00:03:04.020> listening<00:03:04.320> all<00:03:04.620> the

00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:04.650 
if he was right there listening all the

00:03:04.650 --> 00:03:06.620 
if he was right there listening all the
time<00:03:04.800> and<00:03:05.310> giving<00:03:05.580> us<00:03:05.700> the<00:03:05.820> lessons<00:03:06.180> it<00:03:06.510> could

00:03:06.620 --> 00:03:06.630 
time and giving us the lessons it could

00:03:06.630 --> 00:03:07.880 
time and giving us the lessons it could
be<00:03:06.720> a<00:03:06.750> little<00:03:06.959> bit<00:03:07.050> intimidating<00:03:07.709> and

00:03:07.880 --> 00:03:07.890 
be a little bit intimidating and

00:03:07.890 --> 00:03:09.020 
be a little bit intimidating and
difficult<00:03:08.370> and<00:03:08.550> where<00:03:08.700> do<00:03:08.760> you<00:03:08.850> draw<00:03:09.000> that

00:03:09.020 --> 00:03:09.030 
difficult and where do you draw that

00:03:09.030 --> 00:03:11.510 
difficult and where do you draw that
line<00:03:09.510> and<00:03:09.540> when<00:03:10.380> does<00:03:10.530> he<00:03:10.680> get<00:03:10.800> ever<00:03:10.920> get<00:03:11.100> free

00:03:11.510 --> 00:03:11.520 
line and when does he get ever get free

00:03:11.520 --> 00:03:13.580 
line and when does he get ever get free
from<00:03:11.820> us<00:03:12.000> because<00:03:12.450> we<00:03:12.570> live<00:03:12.900> in<00:03:13.020> the<00:03:13.110> house<00:03:13.290> and

00:03:16.970 --> 00:03:16.980 
we can move two of us so that's another

00:03:16.980 --> 00:03:18.470 
we can move two of us so that's another
thing<00:03:17.100> to<00:03:17.280> keep<00:03:17.459> in<00:03:17.610> mind<00:03:17.880> if<00:03:18.090> you're<00:03:18.180> teaching
