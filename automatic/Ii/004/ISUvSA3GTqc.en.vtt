00:00:16.010 --> 00:00:19.199
 hello hello welcome to all and 

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:20.520
 all on cocktail is today a 

00:00:19.199 --> 00:00:23.519
 new introductory video that carries 

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:25.529
 on a smartphone the huawei p-81 

00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:27.359
 clearly high-end phone that 

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:28.740
 arrives in a very beautiful little box 

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:30.330
 with a beautiful packaging in which we go 

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:33.690
 find a helmet to load a year father 

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:36.300
 a cable a micro usb 

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:38.010
 everything is very very well presented and 

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:39.719
 you'll see the phone is not 

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:42.239
 not far from it with a 

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:43.739
 finish is really at the withers 

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:46.440
 rediscover everyone at this party it's 

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:48.780
 now it's sure that at the tv club as 

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:50.820
 always we start this video with 

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:51.570
 a comparison with different sizes 

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:53.610
 telephone 

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:56.399
 here we have the huawei we pay fast 

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:58.199
 so with a 5.2 inch screen we see 

00:00:56.399 --> 00:00:59.879
 that the slab is really very very 

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:03.030
 close to the edges then we have a 

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:07.950
 iphone 5s in case of thumb is finally here 

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:09.270
 we have a discomfort in 5.5 inches she 

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:10.860
 without further ado we discover this ep 

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:16.009
 quickly we start with the dimensions 

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:21.689
 we are on 144 9 mm high by at 71 

00:01:16.009 --> 00:01:24.270
 8 mm wide and 6 4 mm high 

00:01:21.689 --> 00:01:28.500
 all for a weight of 140 4 grams 

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:30.270
 what for a phone in 5.2 inches 

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:32.790
 is really not bad 

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:36.000
 the phone is really extra-fine 

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:36.990
 is rather very light in hand on the 

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:38.460
 tube is pretty classic 

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:43.350
 our brightness sensor the top 

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:46.860
 the apn Apn worried at the fort in 

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:48.119
 will have 8 mp in the front we also have here 

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:49.259
 a diode system can not have it 

00:01:48.119 --> 00:01:50.610
 but for example when you load the 

00:01:49.259 --> 00:01:51.960
 phone a little green diode that 

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:52.170
 lights up and all that is rather not 

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:54.149
 wrong 

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:58.170
 then we have the slab so the slab 

00:01:54.149 --> 00:01:59.990
 it's a 5.2 inches in full HD with 

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:03.719
 two beds ps neo 

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:05.549
 we are very very close to the edges so 

00:02:03.719 --> 00:02:08.640
 it really gives a great impression 

00:02:05.549 --> 00:02:09.660
 on the phone at the bottom we have a 

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:11.730
 finishing in 

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:14.130
 and so it's pretty nice about 

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:16.110
 sides we see it is entirely in 

00:02:14.130 --> 00:02:19.620
 aluminum on the tent we will find the 

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:23.760
 power button the most the month for the 

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:28.170
 volume the two drawers to tidy the 

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:31.080
 micro SD card or sim cards in the 

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:36.450
 we're at the party for m 

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:39.660
 the 3.5 inch jack a little mic the 

00:02:36.450 --> 00:02:41.970
 left side is it totally smooth and 

00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:46.110
 below we have the speakers with 

00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:50.280
 here the input for the usb plug to 

00:02:46.110 --> 00:02:52.110
 the rear one to the full aluminum here a 

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:54.450
 part that is similar to the one we 

00:02:52.110 --> 00:02:58.140
 found at the front we have the logo or 

00:02:54.450 --> 00:03:01.100
 huawei and we will find a device in 

00:02:58.140 --> 00:03:03.300
 13th peace with his flash 

00:03:01.100 --> 00:03:05.610
 it has already been said at the level of finishing 

00:03:03.300 --> 00:03:08.520
 has nothing to say or complain 

00:03:05.610 --> 00:03:10.710
 from this phone which is just very very 

00:03:08.520 --> 00:03:14.580
 do well we see it on the back here we 

00:03:10.710 --> 00:03:16.970
 is on a pretty assembly quality 

00:03:14.580 --> 00:03:21.840
 close to this plu can provide a samsung 

00:03:16.970 --> 00:03:23.670
 or an apple while we're going to leave the 

00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:29.430
 phone start so we press the 

00:03:23.670 --> 00:03:31.500
 power while we're going to let the 

00:03:29.430 --> 00:03:33.060
 phone started we will talk to you about being 

00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:34.080
 technical characteristics at the end 

00:03:33.060 --> 00:03:36.000
 of the hardware part that links to 

00:03:34.080 --> 00:03:39.600
 inside know that we are just under 

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:43.410
 android 5.0 with an overlay emotion 

00:03:39.600 --> 00:03:45.600
 three points on layer that is 

00:03:43.410 --> 00:03:46.920
 nice but a bit dated 

00:03:45.600 --> 00:03:49.920
 in our opinion in the choice of colors 

00:03:46.920 --> 00:03:52.140
 of all those things, it's still 

00:03:49.920 --> 00:03:53.510
 all very well done there is no problem 

00:03:52.140 --> 00:03:55.110
 at this level 

00:03:53.510 --> 00:03:56.850
 so then at the level of 

00:03:55.110 --> 00:03:59.400
 technical characteristics we are on 

00:03:56.850 --> 00:04:03.150
 a 64-bit octo cores base with a 

00:03:59.400 --> 00:04:06.930
 quine ring 930 so we have four hearts to 

00:04:03.150 --> 00:04:09.420
 53 to 1.5 gigahertz and four hearts to 53 

00:04:06.930 --> 00:04:10.740
 case launched at two gigas so when we have 

00:04:09.420 --> 00:04:12.150
 need for performance we use the 

00:04:10.740 --> 00:04:16.140
 four that are giguÃ¨re otherwise 

00:04:12.150 --> 00:04:17.880
 use the four that are at 1.5 

00:04:16.140 --> 00:04:18.540
 gigahertz which actually allows to win 

00:04:17.880 --> 00:04:22.020
 autonomy 

00:04:18.540 --> 00:04:25.440
 simply then we will have 3 

00:04:22.020 --> 00:04:28.140
 gig of ram 16 or 64 gigabytes of storage there 

00:04:25.440 --> 00:04:29.880
 we are on the version 16 giga we have a 

00:04:28.140 --> 00:04:32.730
 micro SD hosting cards 

00:04:29.880 --> 00:04:35.940
 up to 128 giga the cameras on 

00:04:32.730 --> 00:04:40.350
 said it to 1.13 mp in opening f 2.0 

00:04:35.940 --> 00:04:43.080
 and an 8 mp opening f 2.4 we have 

00:04:40.350 --> 00:04:48.260
 sure the wifi n the bluetooth the nfc 

00:04:43.080 --> 00:04:51.240
 the gps the quest glt e and a battery of 

00:04:48.260 --> 00:04:53.880
 2680 min in pair eur aud level of the 

00:04:51.240 --> 00:04:55.940
 battery to you will get about a 

00:04:53.880 --> 00:04:58.400
 day a little more than a day 

00:04:55.940 --> 00:04:59.550
 of autonomy in use relatively 

00:04:58.400 --> 00:05:01.410
 intensive 

00:04:59.550 --> 00:05:03.030
 after at the phone level itself 

00:05:01.410 --> 00:05:06.270
 as we said we have an overlay 

00:05:03.030 --> 00:05:08.130
 which is a little bit out of fashion 

00:05:06.270 --> 00:05:10.740
 shall we say but after that it's just 

00:05:08.130 --> 00:05:12.450
 a question of aesthetics we like or 

00:05:10.740 --> 00:05:14.820
 we do not like after at the phone 

00:05:12.450 --> 00:05:18.860
 it has nothing to say or complain 

00:05:14.820 --> 00:05:21.870
 on use since everything works 

00:05:18.860 --> 00:05:25.080
 really well we have a part 

00:05:21.870 --> 00:05:28.770
 photo which is rather which is rather 

00:05:25.080 --> 00:05:29.640
 nice with a device that gets 

00:05:28.770 --> 00:05:32.850
 always show relatively 

00:05:29.640 --> 00:05:34.590
 this is not a problem we have 

00:05:32.850 --> 00:05:37.520
 also a photo part that is good 

00:05:34.590 --> 00:05:40.770
 worked with many different effects 

00:05:37.520 --> 00:05:45.480
 we have the video where you see the time 

00:05:40.770 --> 00:05:47.040
 lapse the photos we can embellish them 

00:05:45.480 --> 00:05:50.090
 then there are different modes for example 

00:05:47.040 --> 00:05:52.370
 for captious captured for example 

00:05:50.090 --> 00:05:54.620
 the water so we take a picture and then 

00:05:52.370 --> 00:05:56.240
 we will capture the water where we can capture 

00:05:54.620 --> 00:05:58.250
 the headlights of cars so that's 

00:05:56.240 --> 00:06:00.410
 rather well done so no button 

00:05:58.250 --> 00:06:02.000
 touch buttons girl in the bar 

00:06:00.410 --> 00:06:03.740
 they are integrated directly on the screen 

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:04.100
 we see it on the screen takes a lot of 

00:06:03.740 --> 00:06:07.460
 square 

00:06:04.100 --> 00:06:08.900
 so that's super nice because we 

00:06:07.460 --> 00:06:11.479
 really feels like a screen 

00:06:08.900 --> 00:06:13.160
 which more extensive than on a majority 

00:06:11.479 --> 00:06:14.419
 other phones 

00:06:13.160 --> 00:06:17.150
 it almost feels like 

00:06:14.419 --> 00:06:19.610
 borderless but there is still a one 

00:06:17.150 --> 00:06:21.680
 small small millimeters there on the 

00:06:19.610 --> 00:06:22.729
 black edge so it's done well because 

00:06:21.680 --> 00:06:24.139
 that with the hour markers we have 

00:06:22.729 --> 00:06:25.820
 the impression of pushing back a little bit 

00:06:24.139 --> 00:06:29.210
 more screen but it is not necessarily 

00:06:25.820 --> 00:06:31.070
 a truth after we see it a whole is 

00:06:29.210 --> 00:06:33.350
 fluid at the menu level it's 

00:06:31.070 --> 00:06:34.639
 will move fairly quickly we will check 

00:06:33.350 --> 00:06:36.910
 performance in a comprehensive test 

00:06:34.639 --> 00:06:39.919
 to be very soon what will give 

00:06:36.910 --> 00:06:42.820
 which will give you more 

00:06:39.919 --> 00:06:46.070
 details on the performance of this quine 

00:06:42.820 --> 00:06:48.380
 so after that we can change all 

00:06:46.070 --> 00:06:49.669
 over layers finally all 

00:06:48.380 --> 00:06:51.979
 overlay we can change the effects 

00:06:49.669 --> 00:06:54.680
 story of having something of a 

00:06:51.979 --> 00:06:56.479
 little less dated as we talked about 

00:06:54.680 --> 00:06:57.490
 just now so many topics 

00:06:56.479 --> 00:06:59.450
 different 

00:06:57.490 --> 00:07:01.039
 so that's a good thing if 

00:06:59.450 --> 00:07:03.950
 it's nice to see her 

00:07:01.039 --> 00:07:06.380
 we also have a lot of tools so with 

00:07:03.950 --> 00:07:08.450
 the updates after we have as on 

00:07:06.380 --> 00:07:10.460
 many other phones the possibility 

00:07:08.450 --> 00:07:14.930
 to activate for example the lamp or the 

00:07:10.460 --> 00:07:18.430
 things like that so we'll come back 

00:07:14.930 --> 00:07:21.590
 now on the tariff of this country 8 

00:07:18.430 --> 00:07:24.580
 we are on a base of 499 euros when 

00:07:21.590 --> 00:07:27.080
 even what is very high for a 

00:07:24.580 --> 00:07:29.300
 smartphone finally another opinion this 

00:07:27.080 --> 00:07:32.330
 remains very high but we really 

00:07:29.300 --> 00:07:34.760
 a phone that is very very good 

00:07:32.330 --> 00:07:36.770
 quality and very good bill 

00:07:34.760 --> 00:07:38.840
 then we will give you a definitive opinion 

00:07:36.770 --> 00:07:41.180
 and complete on this last township will be 

00:07:38.840 --> 00:07:44.150
 leaned on the hardware tests in order to 

00:07:41.180 --> 00:07:45.979
 know what's worth what ruins 930 on 

00:07:44.150 --> 00:07:47.240
 what are you saying very soon on rococo 

00:07:45.979 --> 00:07:48.320
 full of points as for our tests is 

00:07:47.240 --> 00:07:50.530
 sure call for our next tv 

00:07:48.320 --> 00:07:50.530
 videos
