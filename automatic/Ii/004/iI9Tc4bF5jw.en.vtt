alright<00:00:37.469> so<00:00:38.040> in<00:00:38.280> the<00:00:38.399> first<00:00:38.579> step<00:00:38.850> we<00:00:39.090> need<00:00:39.120> to

00:00:39.229 --> 00:00:39.239 
alright so in the first step we need to

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:41.660 
alright so in the first step we need to
do<00:00:39.390> the<00:00:39.540> most<00:00:39.719> boring<00:00:40.350> job<00:00:40.379> cut<00:00:41.309> out<00:00:41.340> the

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:41.670 
do the most boring job cut out the

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:44.440 
do the most boring job cut out the
actual<00:00:42.090> skin<00:00:42.510> from<00:00:42.750> the<00:00:42.809> paper

00:00:44.440 --> 00:00:44.450 
actual skin from the paper

00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:47.029 
actual skin from the paper
this<00:00:45.450> can<00:00:45.660> take<00:00:45.809> couple<00:00:46.170> of<00:00:46.289> minutes<00:00:46.649> just

00:00:47.029 --> 00:00:47.039 
this can take couple of minutes just

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:48.950 
this can take couple of minutes just
make<00:00:47.399> sure<00:00:47.670> that<00:00:47.700> you<00:00:48.030> are<00:00:48.120> doing<00:00:48.300> nice<00:00:48.600> and

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:48.960 
make sure that you are doing nice and

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:51.709 
make sure that you are doing nice and
precise<00:00:49.440> cuts<00:00:49.800> you<00:00:50.700> don't<00:00:50.910> want<00:00:51.090> your<00:00:51.180> cube<00:00:51.539> to

00:00:51.709 --> 00:00:51.719 
precise cuts you don't want your cube to

00:00:51.719 --> 00:01:11.149 
precise cuts you don't want your cube to
look<00:00:51.870> messed<00:00:52.110> up

00:01:11.149 --> 00:01:11.159 

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:13.710 

next<00:01:12.159> step<00:01:12.399> is<00:01:12.580> cutting<00:01:13.090> the<00:01:13.210> holes<00:01:13.450> to

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:13.720 
next step is cutting the holes to

00:01:13.720 --> 00:01:16.289 
next step is cutting the holes to
connect<00:01:14.020> the<00:01:14.110> elements<00:01:14.640> find<00:01:15.640> a<00:01:15.880> useless

00:01:16.289 --> 00:01:16.299 
connect the elements find a useless

00:01:16.299 --> 00:01:18.480 
connect the elements find a useless
piece<00:01:16.630> of<00:01:16.659> cobble<00:01:17.200> or<00:01:17.380> anything<00:01:18.100> else<00:01:18.369> you

00:01:18.480 --> 00:01:18.490 
piece of cobble or anything else you

00:01:18.490 --> 00:01:20.370 
piece of cobble or anything else you
don't<00:01:18.610> need<00:01:18.850> so<00:01:19.119> you<00:01:19.240> can<00:01:19.420> count<00:01:19.689> the<00:01:19.810> paper<00:01:20.049> on

00:01:20.370 --> 00:01:20.380 
don't need so you can count the paper on

00:01:20.380 --> 00:01:22.080 
don't need so you can count the paper on
it<00:01:20.590> without<00:01:20.830> being<00:01:21.130> afraid<00:01:21.399> to<00:01:21.520> cut<00:01:21.880> your

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:22.090 
it without being afraid to cut your

00:01:22.090 --> 00:01:25.320 
it without being afraid to cut your
table<00:01:22.920> just<00:01:23.920> look<00:01:24.130> for<00:01:24.340> the<00:01:24.460> white<00:01:24.580> stripes<00:01:25.090> on

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:25.330 
table just look for the white stripes on

00:01:25.330 --> 00:01:27.359 
table just look for the white stripes on
the<00:01:25.570> connecting<00:01:25.990> elements<00:01:26.530> and<00:01:26.710> make<00:01:27.039> nice

00:01:27.359 --> 00:01:27.369 
the connecting elements and make nice

00:01:27.369 --> 00:01:31.680 
the connecting elements and make nice
precise<00:01:28.030> cuts<00:01:28.420> on<00:01:28.659> top<00:01:28.929> of<00:01:29.050> them<00:01:30.450> try<00:01:31.450> to<00:01:31.479> make

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:31.690 
precise cuts on top of them try to make

00:01:31.690 --> 00:01:35.580 
precise cuts on top of them try to make
cuts<00:01:32.020> closer<00:01:32.470> to<00:01:32.830> the<00:01:32.920> block<00:01:33.130> texture<00:01:34.319> as<00:01:35.319> soon

00:01:35.580 --> 00:01:35.590 
cuts closer to the block texture as soon

00:01:35.590 --> 00:01:37.200 
cuts closer to the block texture as soon
as<00:01:35.710> you<00:01:35.860> finish<00:01:36.190> cutting<00:01:36.460> the<00:01:36.640> holes<00:01:36.880> it's

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:37.210 
as you finish cutting the holes it's

00:01:37.210 --> 00:01:39.809 
as you finish cutting the holes it's
time<00:01:37.569> to<00:01:37.869> fold<00:01:38.170> this<00:01:38.409> inside<00:01:39.009> like<00:01:39.340> it's<00:01:39.520> shown

00:01:39.809 --> 00:01:39.819 
time to fold this inside like it's shown

00:01:39.819 --> 00:01:43.020 
time to fold this inside like it's shown
on<00:01:40.030> the<00:01:40.270> video<00:01:41.340> connection<00:01:42.340> elements<00:01:42.819> will

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:43.030 
on the video connection elements will

00:01:43.030 --> 00:01:45.870 
on the video connection elements will
fall<00:01:43.299> nicely<00:01:43.569> thanks<00:01:44.289> to<00:01:44.440> our<00:01:44.470> cuts<00:01:44.890> but<00:01:45.700> to

00:01:45.870 --> 00:01:45.880 
fall nicely thanks to our cuts but to

00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:47.999 
fall nicely thanks to our cuts but to
fold<00:01:46.090> the<00:01:46.209> blocks<00:01:46.450> texture<00:01:46.959> parts<00:01:47.319> you<00:01:47.830> need

00:01:47.999 --> 00:01:48.009 
fold the blocks texture parts you need

00:01:48.009 --> 00:01:50.249 
fold the blocks texture parts you need
to<00:01:48.069> use<00:01:48.310> a<00:01:48.490> ruler<00:01:48.819> or<00:01:49.000> anything<00:01:49.750> you'll<00:01:49.929> find

00:01:50.249 --> 00:01:50.259 
to use a ruler or anything you'll find

00:01:50.259 --> 00:02:05.640 
to use a ruler or anything you'll find
appropriate<00:01:50.649> to<00:01:51.130> make<00:01:51.280> nice<00:01:51.580> straight<00:01:52.119> vaults

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:05.650 

00:02:05.650 --> 00:02:07.800 

as<00:02:06.160> soon<00:02:06.460> as<00:02:06.490> you<00:02:06.700> finish<00:02:06.880> folding<00:02:07.450> you<00:02:07.600> can

00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:07.810 
as soon as you finish folding you can

00:02:07.810 --> 00:02:10.290 
as soon as you finish folding you can
start<00:02:08.170> assembling<00:02:08.380> the<00:02:08.890> cube<00:02:09.250> the<00:02:09.759> numbers<00:02:10.119> on

00:02:10.290 --> 00:02:10.300 
start assembling the cube the numbers on

00:02:10.300 --> 00:02:11.910 
start assembling the cube the numbers on
the<00:02:10.420> connecting<00:02:10.869> elements<00:02:11.350> do<00:02:11.530> not<00:02:11.560> determine

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:11.920 
the connecting elements do not determine

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:14.790 
the connecting elements do not determine
the<00:02:12.220> sequence<00:02:12.490> of<00:02:12.940> assembly<00:02:13.630> they<00:02:14.290> just<00:02:14.560> mark

00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:14.800 
the sequence of assembly they just mark

00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:16.920 
the sequence of assembly they just mark
the<00:02:15.010> elements<00:02:15.580> that<00:02:15.790> need<00:02:15.850> to<00:02:16.240> be<00:02:16.270> connected

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:16.930 
the elements that need to be connected

00:02:16.930 --> 00:02:19.980 
the elements that need to be connected
you<00:02:17.800> can<00:02:17.830> assemble<00:02:18.280> it<00:02:18.610> in<00:02:18.880> any<00:02:19.180> way<00:02:19.480> for

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:19.990 
you can assemble it in any way for

00:02:19.990 --> 00:02:34.200 
you can assemble it in any way for
example<00:02:20.380> like<00:02:20.650> I<00:02:20.860> did<00:02:21.100> in<00:02:21.220> video<00:02:21.670> and<00:02:33.000> here<00:02:34.000> we

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:34.210 
example like I did in video and here we

00:02:34.210 --> 00:02:37.050 
example like I did in video and here we
go<00:02:34.450> guys<00:02:34.690> we<00:02:35.170> have<00:02:35.380> our<00:02:35.410> own<00:02:35.740> diamond<00:02:36.370> or<00:02:36.520> cube

00:02:37.050 --> 00:02:37.060 
go guys we have our own diamond or cube

00:02:37.060 --> 00:02:39.240 
go guys we have our own diamond or cube
from<00:02:37.300> minecraft<00:02:37.959> but<00:02:38.740> I<00:02:38.800> think<00:02:39.070> that

00:02:39.240 --> 00:02:39.250 
from minecraft but I think that

00:02:39.250 --> 00:02:42.810 
from minecraft but I think that
something<00:02:39.970> is<00:02:40.270> missing<00:02:40.690> of<00:02:41.530> course<00:02:42.280> it's<00:02:42.580> the

00:02:42.810 --> 00:02:42.820 
something is missing of course it's the

00:02:42.820 --> 00:02:47.820 
something is missing of course it's the
pickaxe<00:02:45.450> so<00:02:46.450> that's<00:02:46.720> it<00:02:46.900> guys<00:02:47.140> hope<00:02:47.470> you<00:02:47.650> liked

00:02:47.820 --> 00:02:47.830 
pickaxe so that's it guys hope you liked

00:02:47.830 --> 00:02:49.920 
pickaxe so that's it guys hope you liked
