00:00:04.550 --> 00:00:04.560 
hi this is John Boehner we have a couple

00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:08.810 
hi this is John Boehner we have a couple
questions<00:00:05.100> on<00:00:06.410> how<00:00:07.410> these<00:00:07.649> injectors<00:00:08.040> work<00:00:08.550> as

00:00:08.810 --> 00:00:08.820 
questions on how these injectors work as

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:13.910 
questions on how these injectors work as
far<00:00:09.090> as<00:00:09.240> our<00:00:09.420> custom<00:00:10.290> series<00:00:10.650> I<00:00:12.679> just<00:00:13.679> wanted

00:00:13.910 --> 00:00:13.920 
far as our custom series I just wanted

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:16.490 
far as our custom series I just wanted
to<00:00:13.980> show<00:00:14.160> you<00:00:14.190> a<00:00:14.370> couple<00:00:14.519> things<00:00:14.700> first<00:00:15.500> the

00:00:16.490 --> 00:00:16.500 
to show you a couple things first the

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:18.380 
to show you a couple things first the
injector<00:00:17.010> this<00:00:17.160> is<00:00:17.310> the<00:00:17.400> way<00:00:17.520> it<00:00:17.640> comes<00:00:17.910> this

00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:18.390 
injector this is the way it comes this

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:21.740 
injector this is the way it comes this
is<00:00:18.570> a<00:00:19.400> core<00:00:20.400> that's<00:00:20.670> going<00:00:20.820> to<00:00:20.880> go<00:00:21.029> in<00:00:21.119> and<00:00:21.210> l98

00:00:21.740 --> 00:00:21.750 
is a core that's going to go in and l98

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:24.679 
is a core that's going to go in and l98
hasn't<00:00:22.710> been<00:00:22.830> touched<00:00:23.010> yet<00:00:23.250> or<00:00:23.760> modified<00:00:24.359> or

00:00:24.679 --> 00:00:24.689 
hasn't been touched yet or modified or

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:26.920 
hasn't been touched yet or modified or
anything<00:00:25.199> it's<00:00:25.890> just<00:00:25.980> the<00:00:26.220> way<00:00:26.340> we<00:00:26.519> get<00:00:26.670> them

00:00:26.920 --> 00:00:26.930 
anything it's just the way we get them

00:00:26.930 --> 00:00:29.929 
anything it's just the way we get them
okay<00:00:27.930> now<00:00:28.500> a<00:00:28.710> lot<00:00:28.890> of<00:00:29.010> guys<00:00:29.189> think<00:00:29.550> that<00:00:29.760> these

00:00:29.929 --> 00:00:29.939 
okay now a lot of guys think that these

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:33.560 
okay now a lot of guys think that these
are<00:00:30.179> a<00:00:30.570> solid<00:00:31.380> plastic<00:00:32.160> and<00:00:32.399> objector<00:00:32.820> okay

00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:33.570 
are a solid plastic and objector okay

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:36.340 
are a solid plastic and objector okay
i'm<00:00:34.410> going<00:00:34.620> to<00:00:34.710> show<00:00:34.890> you<00:00:34.920> one<00:00:35.280> crosscut<00:00:35.940> i

00:00:36.340 --> 00:00:36.350 
i'm going to show you one crosscut i

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:40.160 
i'm going to show you one crosscut i
opened<00:00:37.350> it<00:00:37.410> up<00:00:38.270> this<00:00:39.270> is<00:00:39.450> what<00:00:39.570> the<00:00:39.690> inside<00:00:40.020> the

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:40.170 
opened it up this is what the inside the

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:42.500 
opened it up this is what the inside the
injector<00:00:40.620> looks<00:00:40.860> like<00:00:41.100> and<00:00:41.370> as<00:00:42.180> you<00:00:42.329> can<00:00:42.480> see

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:42.510 
injector looks like and as you can see

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:45.470 
injector looks like and as you can see
the<00:00:42.840> plastic<00:00:43.440> is<00:00:43.680> nothing<00:00:44.550> more<00:00:44.760> than<00:00:44.820> a<00:00:45.090> cover

00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:45.480 
the plastic is nothing more than a cover

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:51.170 
the plastic is nothing more than a cover
over<00:00:46.430> a<00:00:47.430> stainless<00:00:48.270> steel<00:00:48.300> body<00:00:49.760> with<00:00:50.760> a<00:00:50.789> coil

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:51.180 
over a stainless steel body with a coil

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:56.380 
over a stainless steel body with a coil
on<00:00:51.360> top<00:00:52.129> okay<00:00:53.129> now<00:00:53.340> inside<00:00:54.379> there<00:00:55.379> it<00:00:55.500> is<00:00:55.649> again

00:00:56.380 --> 00:00:56.390 
on top okay now inside there it is again

00:00:56.390 --> 00:00:58.849 
on top okay now inside there it is again
right<00:00:57.390> that's<00:00:57.780> that's<00:00:58.320> the<00:00:58.649> bosch<00:00:58.829> three

00:00:58.849 --> 00:00:58.859 
right that's that's the bosch three

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:02.150 
right that's that's the bosch three
injector<00:00:59.640> see<00:01:00.570> if<00:01:00.719> it's<00:01:01.050> highly<00:01:01.710> machined

00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:02.160 
injector see if it's highly machined

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:05.870 
injector see if it's highly machined
it's<00:01:02.520> all<00:01:02.820> stainless<00:01:03.239> steel<00:01:03.480> and<00:01:04.519> the<00:01:05.519> pintle

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:05.880 
it's all stainless steel and the pintle

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:09.100 
it's all stainless steel and the pintle
valve<00:01:06.060> is<00:01:06.650> inside<00:01:07.650> the<00:01:07.950> injector<00:01:08.460> right<00:01:08.700> here

00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:09.110 
valve is inside the injector right here

00:01:09.110 --> 00:01:12.770 
valve is inside the injector right here
okay<00:01:10.110> and<00:01:10.430> the<00:01:11.430> coil<00:01:11.729> which<00:01:12.030> is<00:01:12.180> mounted<00:01:12.330> above

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:12.780 
okay and the coil which is mounted above

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:16.850 
okay and the coil which is mounted above
it<00:01:12.960> is<00:01:13.950> surrounded<00:01:14.640> by<00:01:14.670> the<00:01:15.200> vanilla<00:01:16.200> plastic

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:16.860 
it is surrounded by the vanilla plastic

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:20.660 
it is surrounded by the vanilla plastic
and<00:01:17.210> the<00:01:18.210> plastic<00:01:18.420> also<00:01:19.020> gives<00:01:19.290> the<00:01:19.670> bosses

00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:20.670 
and the plastic also gives the bosses

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:24.070 
and the plastic also gives the bosses
for<00:01:20.850> the<00:01:20.970> o-ring<00:01:21.299> seals<00:01:21.630> and<00:01:21.990> etc<00:01:22.860> and<00:01:23.310> the

to<00:02:19.010> compare<00:02:19.430> the<00:02:20.150> 32<00:02:21.049> and<00:02:21.319> a<00:02:21.380> 42<00:02:21.830> to<00:02:22.130> a<00:02:22.160> brand

00:02:22.449 --> 00:02:22.459 
to compare the 32 and a 42 to a brand

00:02:22.459 --> 00:02:25.809 
to compare the 32 and a 42 to a brand
new<00:02:22.640> one<00:02:22.760> right<00:02:23.000> next<00:02:23.209> to<00:02:23.420> it<00:02:23.650> okay<00:02:24.700> we'll<00:02:25.700> see

00:02:25.809 --> 00:02:25.819 
new one right next to it okay we'll see

00:02:25.819 --> 00:02:29.680 
new one right next to it okay we'll see
you<00:02:25.880> in<00:02:25.940> a<00:02:26.000> few<00:02:26.230> okay<00:02:27.230> the<00:02:27.739> for<00:02:28.310> stock<00:02:28.580> 24s<00:02:29.510> are

00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:29.690 
you in a few okay the for stock 24s are

00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:31.449 
you in a few okay the for stock 24s are
on<00:02:29.810> the<00:02:29.959> rail<00:02:30.140> and<00:02:30.410> I'm<00:02:30.830> going<00:02:31.010> to<00:02:31.069> just<00:02:31.250> flow

00:02:31.449 --> 00:02:31.459 
on the rail and I'm going to just flow

00:02:31.459 --> 00:02:33.280 
on the rail and I'm going to just flow
them<00:02:31.730> so<00:02:31.910> you<00:02:32.000> see<00:02:32.269> what<00:02:32.390> the<00:02:32.510> volume<00:02:32.870> is<00:02:33.019> right

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:33.290 
them so you see what the volume is right

00:02:33.290 --> 00:02:36.220 
them so you see what the volume is right
now<00:02:33.940> we're<00:02:34.940> going<00:02:35.030> to<00:02:35.120> do<00:02:35.209> it<00:02:35.330> for<00:02:35.360> 20<00:02:35.750> seconds

00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:36.230 
now we're going to do it for 20 seconds

00:02:36.230 --> 00:02:37.900 
now we're going to do it for 20 seconds
and<00:02:36.470> then<00:02:36.530> we'll<00:02:36.709> multiply<00:02:36.860> it<00:02:37.190> out<00:02:37.400> give<00:02:37.880> you

00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:37.910 
and then we'll multiply it out give you

00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:41.470 
and then we'll multiply it out give you
the<00:02:38.090> pounds<00:02:38.420> per<00:02:38.569> hour<00:02:39.970> this<00:02:40.970> has<00:02:41.150> done<00:02:41.329> it

00:02:41.470 --> 00:02:41.480 
the pounds per hour this has done it

00:02:41.480 --> 00:03:03.809 
the pounds per hour this has done it
static<00:02:41.930> flow

00:03:03.809 --> 00:03:03.819 

00:03:03.819 --> 00:03:08.410 

okay<00:03:04.819> 85cc<00:03:05.720> is<00:03:06.110> for<00:03:06.290> 20<00:03:06.620> seconds<00:03:07.120> ich<00:03:08.120> waits

00:03:08.410 --> 00:03:08.420 
okay 85cc is for 20 seconds ich waits

00:03:08.420 --> 00:03:10.390 
okay 85cc is for 20 seconds ich waits
out<00:03:08.659> you'd<00:03:08.870> multiply<00:03:09.079> that<00:03:09.470> times<00:03:09.739> 3<00:03:10.159> and

00:03:10.390 --> 00:03:10.400 
out you'd multiply that times 3 and

00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:13.059 
out you'd multiply that times 3 and
divide<00:03:10.489> it<00:03:10.670> by<00:03:10.879> 10<00:03:11.090> point<00:03:11.420> for<00:03:11.750> roughly<00:03:12.620> twenty

00:03:13.059 --> 00:03:13.069 
divide it by 10 point for roughly twenty

00:03:13.069 --> 00:03:16.000 
divide it by 10 point for roughly twenty
four<00:03:13.280> point<00:03:13.579> seven<00:03:14.030> pounds<00:03:14.870> per<00:03:15.019> hour<00:03:15.230> so

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:16.010 
four point seven pounds per hour so

00:03:16.010 --> 00:03:17.199 
four point seven pounds per hour so
that's<00:03:16.159> what<00:03:16.340> all<00:03:16.370> of<00:03:16.519> these<00:03:16.730> flow<00:03:17.000> their

00:03:17.199 --> 00:03:17.209 
that's what all of these flow their

00:03:17.209 --> 00:03:19.929 
that's what all of these flow their
unmatched<00:03:17.569> up<00:03:17.900> so<00:03:18.230> I<00:03:18.260> I<00:03:18.680> can<00:03:19.310> give<00:03:19.489> the<00:03:19.670> next

00:03:19.929 --> 00:03:19.939 
unmatched up so I I can give the next

00:03:19.939 --> 00:03:22.420 
unmatched up so I I can give the next
test<00:03:20.299> is<00:03:20.510> going<00:03:20.720> to<00:03:20.810> show<00:03:20.989> with<00:03:21.829> the<00:03:21.980> new<00:03:22.129> sizes

00:03:22.420 --> 00:03:22.430 
test is going to show with the new sizes

00:03:22.430 --> 00:03:28.000 
test is going to show with the new sizes
that<00:03:22.879> we<00:03:22.909> produced<00:03:24.189> okay<00:03:25.189> now<00:03:25.400> i<00:03:25.459> have<00:03:25.909> a<00:03:27.010> brand

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:28.010 
that we produced okay now i have a brand

00:03:28.010 --> 00:03:32.170 
that we produced okay now i have a brand
new<00:03:28.250> 42<00:03:28.790> Bosch<00:03:29.060> that's<00:03:29.390> a<00:03:29.480> green<00:03:29.689> top<00:03:29.930> a<00:03:31.180> 26

00:03:32.170 --> 00:03:32.180 
new 42 Bosch that's a green top a 26

00:03:32.180 --> 00:03:37.240 
new 42 Bosch that's a green top a 26
excel<00:03:32.780> and<00:03:33.400> a<00:03:34.400> 30-pound<00:03:35.000> bosch<00:03:35.239> red<00:03:35.989> top<00:03:36.250> so

00:03:37.240 --> 00:03:37.250 
excel and a 30-pound bosch red top so

00:03:37.250 --> 00:03:39.479 
excel and a 30-pound bosch red top so
what<00:03:37.370> we're<00:03:37.459> going<00:03:37.549> to<00:03:37.639> do<00:03:37.760> is<00:03:38.120> make<00:03:38.599> these

00:03:39.479 --> 00:03:39.489 
what we're going to do is make these

00:03:39.489 --> 00:03:42.430 
what we're going to do is make these
custom<00:03:40.489> ones<00:03:40.670> flo<00:03:41.090> exactly<00:03:41.750> the<00:03:42.019> same<00:03:42.260> as

00:03:42.430 --> 00:03:42.440 
custom ones flo exactly the same as

00:03:42.440 --> 00:03:44.680 
custom ones flo exactly the same as
these<00:03:42.650> and<00:03:43.010> then<00:03:43.159> we'll<00:03:43.310> have<00:03:43.519> sets<00:03:44.299> of<00:03:44.510> those

00:03:44.680 --> 00:03:44.690 
these and then we'll have sets of those

00:03:44.690 --> 00:03:47.530 
these and then we'll have sets of those
corresponding<00:03:45.409> sizes<00:03:45.920> so<00:03:46.579> here's<00:03:46.849> here's<00:03:47.359> the

00:03:47.530 --> 00:03:47.540 
corresponding sizes so here's here's the

00:03:47.540 --> 00:04:02.940 
corresponding sizes so here's here's the
flow<00:03:47.750> date<00:03:47.959> on<00:03:48.139> these

00:04:02.940 --> 00:04:02.950 

00:04:02.950 --> 00:04:06.370 

okay<00:04:04.270> so<00:04:05.270> there's<00:04:05.510> your<00:04:05.569> flow<00:04:05.870> data<00:04:06.080> you've

00:04:06.370 --> 00:04:06.380 
okay so there's your flow data you've

00:04:06.380 --> 00:04:11.920 
okay so there's your flow data you've
got<00:04:06.560> 10<00:04:06.980> seconds<00:04:07.459> at<00:04:07.580> 75<00:04:09.370> for<00:04:10.370> the<00:04:10.670> 42<00:04:11.480> so<00:04:11.810> your

00:04:11.920 --> 00:04:11.930 
got 10 seconds at 75 for the 42 so your

00:04:11.930 --> 00:04:15.580 
got 10 seconds at 75 for the 42 so your
time's<00:04:12.170> up<00:04:12.350> by<00:04:12.560> six<00:04:13.690> that's<00:04:14.690> a<00:04:14.840> 42<00:04:15.319> in

00:04:15.580 --> 00:04:15.590 
time's up by six that's a 42 in

00:04:15.590 --> 00:04:17.259 
time's up by six that's a 42 in
corresponding<00:04:16.310> you<00:04:16.400> don't<00:04:16.549> need<00:04:16.669> to<00:04:16.760> math<00:04:16.970> but

00:04:17.259 --> 00:04:17.269 
corresponding you don't need to math but

00:04:17.269 --> 00:04:19.390 
corresponding you don't need to math but
we're<00:04:17.570> going<00:04:17.690> to<00:04:17.750> match<00:04:17.959> these<00:04:18.260> up<00:04:18.320> so<00:04:18.590> it's<00:04:19.100> it

00:04:19.390 --> 00:04:19.400 
we're going to match these up so it's it

00:04:19.400 --> 00:04:21.190 
we're going to match these up so it's it
really<00:04:19.459> doesn't<00:04:20.090> matter<00:04:20.150> what<00:04:20.510> they<00:04:20.660> flow<00:04:20.930> for

00:04:21.190 --> 00:04:21.200 
really doesn't matter what they flow for

00:04:21.200 --> 00:04:23.409 
really doesn't matter what they flow for
how<00:04:21.320> much<00:04:21.470> time<00:04:21.709> or<00:04:21.950> whatever<00:04:22.070> as<00:04:22.790> long<00:04:22.880> as<00:04:23.300> the

00:04:23.409 --> 00:04:23.419 
how much time or whatever as long as the

00:04:23.419 --> 00:04:25.420 
how much time or whatever as long as the
next<00:04:23.750> test<00:04:23.930> when<00:04:24.230> the<00:04:24.410> new<00:04:24.980> ones<00:04:25.250> are

00:04:25.420 --> 00:04:25.430 
next test when the new ones are

00:04:25.430 --> 00:04:27.580 
next test when the new ones are
side-by-side<00:04:25.730> or<00:04:26.630> the<00:04:27.110> ones<00:04:27.260> i<00:04:27.380> make

00:04:27.580 --> 00:04:27.590 
side-by-side or the ones i make

00:04:27.590 --> 00:04:30.280 
side-by-side or the ones i make
side-by-side<00:04:28.430> with<00:04:28.820> these<00:04:29.090> injectors<00:04:29.510> you'll

00:04:30.280 --> 00:04:30.290 
side-by-side with these injectors you'll

00:04:30.290 --> 00:04:33.280 
side-by-side with these injectors you'll
see<00:04:30.500> they<00:04:30.680> flow<00:04:30.889> the<00:04:31.070> same<00:04:31.840> okay<00:04:32.840> well<00:04:32.990> back<00:04:33.139> at

00:04:33.280 --> 00:04:33.290 
see they flow the same okay well back at

00:04:33.290 --> 00:04:36.040 
see they flow the same okay well back at
the<00:04:33.320> flow<00:04:33.620> bench<00:04:33.860> and<00:04:34.669> all<00:04:35.450> the<00:04:35.600> injectors<00:04:36.020> are

00:04:36.040 --> 00:04:36.050 
the flow bench and all the injectors are

00:04:36.050 --> 00:04:38.140 
the flow bench and all the injectors are
matched<00:04:36.410> up<00:04:36.650> next<00:04:36.950> to<00:04:37.010> each<00:04:37.130> other<00:04:37.310> on<00:04:37.669> the

00:04:38.140 --> 00:04:38.150
