00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.220
 it can not be said that the launch of the 

00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:07.020
 has been a failure but a lot of 

00:00:05.220 --> 00:00:08.429
 people stood with one foot behind when he saw 

00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:10.860
 car price 

00:00:08.429 --> 00:00:13.290
 if you are one of these the test today is 

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:16.080
 for you a more account version of 

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:17.460
 modern popular volkswagen the act two 

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:19.529
 doors 

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:22.260
 You're the type that usually walks. 

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:24.990
 alone in the car does not like to ride 

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:26.010
 and likes two-door cars 

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:28.710
 I think I have an option 

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:31.560
 interesting for you I'm talking about 

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:33.899
 volkswagen up two doors up 

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:36.570
 to the market with the price a little less 

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:38.760
 salty than the four - door and 

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:41.270
 mission to occupy the space left by the 

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:41.270
 gol g4 

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:53.380
 the new compact hatch option of the brand 

00:00:51.370 --> 00:00:55.630
 maintains the main 

00:00:53.380 --> 00:00:58.360
 characteristics that exposes modernity 

00:00:55.630 --> 00:01:00.220
 of the project as the body that guarantees 

00:00:58.360 --> 00:01:02.739
 safety of occupants in the event of 

00:01:00.220 --> 00:01:05.830
 collision an efficient mechanical assembly 

00:01:02.739 --> 00:01:08.920
 but with two doors the visual of the op mute 

00:01:05.830 --> 00:01:11.470
 a little less family and younger 

00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:13.930
 the side of the car has changed since the 

00:01:11.470 --> 00:01:16.210
 doors are large and do not seem to have the 

00:01:13.930 --> 00:01:18.640
 columns further expanding the area 

00:01:16.210 --> 00:01:22.030
 glazing, favoring visibility 

00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:24.580
 for driver and passengers and door 

00:01:22.030 --> 00:01:26.649
 great also this name of easy access 

00:01:24.580 --> 00:01:27.550
 but only for those who go to the banks 

00:01:26.649 --> 00:01:30.399
 front 

00:01:27.550 --> 00:01:32.590
 they have the easy entry system that 

00:01:30.399 --> 00:01:34.630
 facilitates folding of the backrest to 

00:01:32.590 --> 00:01:37.030
 rear seat access 

00:01:34.630 --> 00:01:41.800
 but only the driver has the 

00:01:37.030 --> 00:01:44.259
 memory and returns to the original position 

00:01:41.800 --> 00:01:46.090
 front passenger has to be adjusted 

00:01:44.259 --> 00:01:48.420
 every time someone accesses the database 

00:01:46.090 --> 00:01:48.420
 back 

00:01:53.540 --> 00:01:58.190
 and it is necessary to position the seats 

00:01:56.090 --> 00:02:00.620
 properly so as not to damage the 

00:01:58.190 --> 00:02:03.170
 compromise the space of those who go behind 

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:05.630
 there two people settle with 

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:07.100
 relative comfort since the space in the 

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:09.679
 medium is limited 

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:10.610
 not to mention that the central belt is climbing 

00:02:09.679 --> 00:02:12.860
 abdominal 

00:02:10.610 --> 00:02:15.260
 driver and front passenger as well. 

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:17.570
 are well-placed on the banks of 

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:20.720
 anatomical shape and with height adjustment 

00:02:17.570 --> 00:02:22.810
 it is easy to find the best position 

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:22.810
 to drive 

00:02:27.020 --> 00:02:33.030
 the big door problem 

00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:36.630
 is that access to the belt 

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:38.340
 It gets a little bad. Another detail is the 

00:02:36.630 --> 00:02:41.069
 steering wheel that could be a little bit 

00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:43.290
 thicker to improve the handle by it 

00:02:41.069 --> 00:02:45.420
 with height adjustment as well as the 

00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:47.670
 the driver 's seat but the belts 

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:50.400
 security not the interior has finished 

00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:52.860
 good quality but with lots of plastic 

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:55.620
 hard on the dashboard and doors and benches 

00:02:52.860 --> 00:02:57.989
 coated with tissue of type t ha 

00:02:55.620 --> 00:02:59.430
 the instrument panel has easy 

00:02:57.989 --> 00:03:02.220
 visualization 

00:02:59.430 --> 00:03:04.769
 but the big cheap of the model is the maps 

00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:07.550
 the entertainment system and 

00:03:04.769 --> 00:03:10.530
 navigation that with touch screen 

00:03:07.550 --> 00:03:14.519
 allows access to computer sound from 

00:03:10.530 --> 00:03:16.680
 board and the GPS is optional in luck 

00:03:14.519 --> 00:03:19.620
 panel the driver also has the 

00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:23.220
 gearshift indicator helping 

00:03:19.620 --> 00:03:25.830
 in the most economical production and economy and 

00:03:23.220 --> 00:03:29.519
 good performance are strengths of this 

00:03:25.830 --> 00:03:31.680
 small volkswagen the efficient engine 1.0 

00:03:29.519 --> 00:03:33.870
 three-cylinder engine ensures 

00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:36.150
 impressive performance for the 

00:03:33.870 --> 00:03:38.459
 hatch with starts and resumes of 

00:03:36.150 --> 00:03:41.070
 very efficient speed 

00:03:38.459 --> 00:03:43.950
 the good touch contributes to the answers 

00:03:41.070 --> 00:03:45.120
 fast and with ethanol the performance is 

00:03:43.950 --> 00:03:46.920
 even better 

00:03:45.120 --> 00:03:49.769
 and it is worth remembering that he does not have the 

00:03:46.920 --> 00:03:52.170
 not known 

00:03:49.769 --> 00:03:54.570
 five-speed manual gearbox helps 

00:03:52.170 --> 00:03:57.000
 in good performance since they have relations 

00:03:54.570 --> 00:03:59.250
 well staggered with the first and 

00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:01.350
 second shorter 

00:03:59.250 --> 00:04:03.570
 the cart is very smart but in 

00:04:01.350 --> 00:04:06.600
 certain moments it is necessary to 

00:04:03.570 --> 00:04:08.220
 acceleration that cyber screams both in 

00:04:06.600 --> 00:04:11.040
 city ​​and on the road 

00:04:08.220 --> 00:04:12.690
 the happy two doors walks well and presents 

00:04:11.040 --> 00:04:15.329
 average consumption figures 

00:04:12.690 --> 00:04:17.130
 are much better than the 

00:04:15.329 --> 00:04:19.829
 competition 

00:04:17.130 --> 00:04:21.510
 no wonder it's rated aaa 

00:04:19.829 --> 00:04:24.900
 in the Brazilian labeling program 

00:04:21.510 --> 00:04:27.510
 the vehicular inmetro and he also appeals 

00:04:24.900 --> 00:04:30.090
 calibration of the steering and 

00:04:27.510 --> 00:04:33.110
 suspensions that ensure good stability 

00:04:30.090 --> 00:04:33.110
 in curves 

00:04:33.739 --> 00:04:39.419
 op is sold only on the 

00:04:36.809 --> 00:04:41.939
 versions have cap and beginners that was what 

00:04:39.419 --> 00:05:07.740
 we tested it has a list of items from 

00:04:41.939 --> 00:05:10.529
 reasonable series but items like direction 

00:05:07.740 --> 00:05:12.629
 with mechanical power assistance and air 

00:05:10.529 --> 00:05:15.449
 conditioning are in a Relationship 

00:05:12.629 --> 00:05:18.929
 optional is a compact hatch as well 

00:05:15.449 --> 00:05:23.689
 equipped and economical and still costs 2 thousand 

00:05:18.929 --> 00:05:23.689
 unless 14 cuts is not interesting 

00:05:27.110 --> 00:05:32.400
 because it's the two-door apl is sold on 

00:05:30.210 --> 00:05:35.100
 the entry version has twenty-six 

00:05:32.400 --> 00:05:36.420
 one thousand nine hundred reais is the most 

00:05:35.100 --> 00:05:38.430
 cheap line 

00:05:36.420 --> 00:05:41.270
 the version tested by brum with exchange 

00:05:38.430 --> 00:05:46.500
 manual is the glove with prices ranging from 

00:05:41.270 --> 00:05:49.620
 28,890 to 38,807 with automated exchange 

00:05:46.500 --> 00:05:51.990
 i-motion reach 40 thousand five hundred and 

00:05:49.620 --> 00:05:54.840
 seventy-two reais can be expensive, right? 

00:05:51.990 --> 00:05:58.050
 but the notes in the bulletin of the air until good 

00:05:54.840 --> 00:06:00.390
 It begins with 18 in performance and only me logo 

00:05:58.050 --> 00:06:02.490
 for a deserved 10 in the consumption ne 

00:06:00.390 --> 00:06:05.430
 then comes a sequence of eight for the 

00:06:02.490 --> 00:06:07.320
 safety and stability finish 

00:06:05.430 --> 00:06:10.590
 the internal space gained 17 in the 

00:06:07.320 --> 00:06:12.900
 trunk 8 closing the account after two 

00:06:10.590 --> 00:06:14.400
 doors won a 7th note on cost 

00:06:12.900 --> 00:06:15.870
 because with the equipment 

00:06:14.400 --> 00:06:19.520
 essential 

00:06:15.870 --> 00:06:19.520
 it becomes expensive
