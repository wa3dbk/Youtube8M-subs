00:00:00.949 --> 00:00:08.940
 we here will show epe and da 

00:00:04.650 --> 00:00:11.190
 law rouanet tech rp 10 a true 

00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:13.110
 which has already been launched for some years 

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:14.820
 an excellent pedalboard has several 

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:20.640
 functions have a processor well 

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:23.010
 24-bit advanced and puts all 

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:24.060
 basic effects and some more 

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:26.490
 advanced 

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:29.160
 she has 25 banks that you choose 

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:31.410
 through the one you later have 

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:33.260
 five schedules in each bank and still 

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:36.450
 count a programmed can turn off 

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:39.510
 or connect effects of this pressure from above 

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:41.820
 are supports are totally avoidable 

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:44.129
 crankset is also outgoing media is 

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:45.660
 need to make a connection to the 

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:48.360
 computer program 

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:50.370
 she has come out of the stereo and mono too 

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:52.289
 has a headset series then 

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:54.840
 training is nice at home does not need 

00:00:52.289 --> 00:00:57.770
 the amplifier to show that it is a 

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:57.770
 clean sound 

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:08.000
 Do you want to change, let's go around here? 

00:01:05.720 --> 00:01:12.460
 within the same bank the effect 4 that the 

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:19.930
 effect has some opinion of expression 

00:01:12.460 --> 00:01:19.930
 and type like this here oh 

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:39.619
 or am 

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:42.670
 or the absorption is not very heavy thing in 

00:01:39.619 --> 00:01:42.670
 car that had 

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:54.070
 I 'm going to change, I'll choose the bench ball. 

00:01:50.020 --> 00:02:00.250
 four then dispersion that I like and 

00:01:54.070 --> 00:02:03.929
 no more style and the fifth is revoked 

00:02:00.250 --> 00:02:03.929
 smaller expression already arrived at me 

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:26.220
 gum 

00:02:21.370 --> 00:02:26.220
 the cool absorption 

00:02:36.590 --> 00:02:42.209
 squid 

00:02:39.049 --> 00:02:47.909
 and good is better the effect more events 

00:02:42.209 --> 00:02:51.780
 crazy is made of all these with reveal 

00:02:47.909 --> 00:02:56.129
 an Englishman a good among several off the 

00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:58.980
 Legend is so cool I think it's worth it 

00:02:56.129 --> 00:03:02.639
 who will not recognize it is very 

00:02:58.980 --> 00:03:09.109
 very versatile also you let the 

00:03:02.639 --> 00:03:09.109
 The way you want it and only there
