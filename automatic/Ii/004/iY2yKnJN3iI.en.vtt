00:00:39.979 --> 00:00:39.989 
this one looks in the back and I don't

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:41.689

have<00:00:40.080> nothing<00:00:40.260> like<00:00:40.590> it<00:00:40.800> so<00:00:41.070> I<00:00:41.280> thought<00:00:41.580> was

00:00:41.689 --> 00:00:41.699 
have nothing like it so I thought was

00:00:41.699 --> 00:00:45.979 
have nothing like it so I thought was
really<00:00:41.850> cute<00:00:42.680> so<00:00:43.680> that's<00:00:43.890> the<00:00:44.040> bag<00:00:44.360> and<00:00:45.360> then

00:00:45.979 --> 00:00:45.989 
really cute so that's the bag and then

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:57.729 
really cute so that's the bag and then
she<00:00:46.199> want<00:00:46.379> another<00:00:46.710> one<00:00:49.489> which<00:00:50.489> is<00:00:50.520> this<00:00:50.880> one

00:00:57.729 --> 00:00:57.739 

00:00:57.739 --> 00:01:02.660 

because<00:00:58.739> it<00:00:58.950> matches<00:00:59.130> my<00:00:59.399> shoes<00:00:59.670> and<00:01:01.670> it's

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:02.670 
because it matches my shoes and it's

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:10.610 
because it matches my shoes and it's
different<00:01:05.899> so<00:01:06.899> this<00:01:07.080> is<00:01:07.110> how<00:01:07.290> it<00:01:07.470> looks

and I also the one that you saw him over

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:15.380 
and I also the one that you saw him over
