kit for the price I paid so I bought
last<00:01:17.670> year<00:01:18.030> around<00:01:18.299> I<00:01:19.080> think<00:01:19.500> it<00:01:19.619> was<00:01:19.710> 99<00:01:20.220> pound

00:01:20.539 --> 00:01:20.549 
last year around I think it was 99 pound

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:24.710 
last year around I think it was 99 pound
from<00:01:21.390> Argos<00:01:21.990> and<00:01:22.880> to<00:01:23.880> be<00:01:23.970> honest<00:01:24.270> I<00:01:24.390> think<00:01:24.540> it

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:24.720 
from Argos and to be honest I think it

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:26.690 
from Argos and to be honest I think it
compares<00:01:25.080> with<00:01:25.140> the<00:01:25.409> beats<00:01:26.130> by<00:01:26.369> dre

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:26.700 
compares with the beats by dre

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:31.010 
compares with the beats by dre
the<00:01:27.299> Hufford<00:01:27.659> the<00:01:28.470> dry<00:01:29.360> iPod<00:01:30.360> dock<00:01:30.600> cuz<00:01:30.930> I've
