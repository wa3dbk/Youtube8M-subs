all those newfangled stuff coming out
but<00:00:21.689> I<00:00:21.750> figured<00:00:21.869> well<00:00:22.260> you<00:00:22.380> know<00:00:22.500> what<00:00:22.680> an<00:00:22.800> Xbox

00:00:23.179 --> 00:00:23.189 
but I figured well you know what an Xbox

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:25.340 
but I figured well you know what an Xbox
I<00:00:23.369> could<00:00:23.519> probably<00:00:23.699> make<00:00:23.850> one<00:00:24.180> of<00:00:24.300> those<00:00:24.420> can

00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:25.350 
I could probably make one of those can

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:27.620 
I could probably make one of those can
it<00:00:25.439> be<00:00:25.560> that<00:00:25.590> hard<00:00:26.130> to<00:00:26.369> do<00:00:26.640> you<00:00:27.269> know<00:00:27.420> I<00:00:27.449> don't

00:00:27.620 --> 00:00:27.630 
it be that hard to do you know I don't

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:28.970 
it be that hard to do you know I don't

00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:28.980 
exactly know what it is but what the

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:30.950 
exactly know what it is but what the

00:01:23.149 --> 00:01:23.159 
that'll be the top in the bottom of the

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:37.550 
that'll be the top in the bottom of the
X<00:01:23.310> Box<00:01:35.600> okay<00:01:36.600> next<00:01:36.869> we<00:01:37.020> cut<00:01:37.170> yourself<00:01:37.530> some

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:37.560 
X Box okay next we cut yourself some

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:40.340 
X Box okay next we cut yourself some
3-inch<00:01:38.189> thick<00:01:38.490> strips<00:01:39.119> these<00:01:39.960> would<00:01:40.140> be<00:01:40.229> the

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:40.350 
3-inch thick strips these would be the

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:42.800 
3-inch thick strips these would be the
size<00:01:40.619> of<00:01:40.860> the<00:01:40.979> box<00:01:41.329> like<00:01:42.329> that<00:01:42.390> you'll<00:01:42.780> be

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:42.810 
size of the box like that you'll be

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:45.050 
size of the box like that you'll be
assembling<00:01:43.320> this<00:01:43.590> like<00:01:43.740> this<00:01:43.920> so<00:01:44.610> put<00:01:44.820> a<00:01:44.850> bunch

00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:45.060 
assembling this like this so put a bunch

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:48.370 
assembling this like this so put a bunch
of<00:01:45.180> those<00:01:45.329> and<00:01:45.390> then<00:01:46.490> tape<00:01:47.490> them<00:01:47.579> together

00:01:48.370 --> 00:01:48.380 
of those and then tape them together

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:52.130 
of those and then tape them together
that<00:01:49.380> made<00:01:49.590> three<00:01:49.829> inch<00:01:50.329> strips<00:01:51.329> and<00:01:51.600> then<00:01:52.079> I

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:52.140 
that made three inch strips and then I

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:53.389 
that made three inch strips and then I
taped<00:01:52.380> them<00:01:52.560> all<00:01:52.680> the<00:01:52.740> way<00:01:52.799> around<00:01:53.100> and<00:01:53.250> what<00:01:53.369> I

00:01:53.389 --> 00:01:53.399 
taped them all the way around and what I

00:01:53.399 --> 00:01:55.310 
taped them all the way around and what I
did<00:01:53.670> was<00:01:53.790> I<00:01:53.850> actually<00:01:54.420> taped<00:01:54.869> these<00:01:55.020> strips

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:55.320 
did was I actually taped these strips

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:56.990 
did was I actually taped these strips
all<00:01:55.500> together<00:01:55.829> to<00:01:56.070> make<00:01:56.189> one<00:01:56.369> long<00:01:56.579> strip<00:01:56.850> and

00:01:56.990 --> 00:01:57.000 
all together to make one long strip and

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:58.429 
all together to make one long strip and
then<00:01:57.090> wrapped<00:01:57.270> it<00:01:57.420> around<00:01:57.450> they<00:01:58.049> have<00:01:58.170> to<00:01:58.290> cut

00:01:58.429 --> 00:01:58.439 
then wrapped it around they have to cut

00:01:58.439 --> 00:02:00.649 
then wrapped it around they have to cut
each<00:01:58.560> piece<00:01:58.860> individually<00:01:59.299> because<00:02:00.299> unless

00:02:00.649 --> 00:02:00.659 
each piece individually because unless

00:02:00.659 --> 00:02:03.200 
each piece individually because unless
your<00:02:00.930> X<00:02:01.079> is<00:02:01.170> exactly<00:02:01.740> symmetrical<00:02:02.310> so<00:02:02.939> now<00:02:03.090> all

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:03.210 
your X is exactly symmetrical so now all

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:05.050 
your X is exactly symmetrical so now all
I<00:02:03.299> have<00:02:03.450> to<00:02:03.509> do<00:02:03.600> is<00:02:03.689> put<00:02:03.840> the<00:02:03.930> cover<00:02:04.140> on<00:02:04.200> it

00:02:05.050 --> 00:02:05.060 
I have to do is put the cover on it

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:11.980 
I have to do is put the cover on it
take<00:02:06.060> the<00:02:06.149> cover<00:02:06.360> down<00:02:06.570> and<00:02:07.110> my<00:02:07.290> xbox<00:02:07.829> is<00:02:08.179> done
