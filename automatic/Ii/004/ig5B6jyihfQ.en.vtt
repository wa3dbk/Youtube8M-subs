that I was on some questions on but that

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:56.660 
that I was on some questions on but that
just<00:01:55.259> allowed<00:01:55.470> me<00:01:55.619> to<00:01:55.649> think<00:01:55.770> on<00:01:56.100> my<00:01:56.250> feet<00:01:56.280> and

00:01:56.660 --> 00:01:56.670 
just allowed me to think on my feet and

00:01:56.670 --> 00:01:58.700 
just allowed me to think on my feet and
only<00:01:57.210> found<00:01:57.450> that<00:01:57.719> incredibly<00:01:57.960> enjoyable<00:01:58.350> and

00:01:58.700 --> 00:01:58.710 
only found that incredibly enjoyable and

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:00.469 
only found that incredibly enjoyable and
two<00:01:59.280> of<00:01:59.369> my<00:01:59.460> old<00:01:59.610> friends<00:01:59.850> actually<00:01:59.969> how<00:02:00.329> we're

00:02:00.469 --> 00:02:00.479 
two of my old friends actually how we're

00:02:00.479 --> 00:02:01.730 
two of my old friends actually how we're
in<00:02:00.570> similar<00:02:00.750> predicaments<00:02:01.350> and<00:02:01.439> when<00:02:01.530> we<00:02:01.619> came

00:02:01.730 --> 00:02:01.740 
in similar predicaments and when we came

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:05.020 
in similar predicaments and when we came
out<00:02:01.920> we<00:02:02.549> both<00:02:02.700> we<00:02:03.119> were<00:02:03.180> both<00:02:03.329> like<00:02:03.540> yeah<00:02:04.409> I

00:02:05.020 --> 00:02:05.030 
out we both we were both like yeah I

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:08.600 
out we both we were both like yeah I
wasn't<00:02:06.030> it<00:02:06.360> was<00:02:06.420> an<00:02:06.570> ideal<00:02:06.899> but<00:02:07.710> uh<00:02:07.740> it<00:02:08.160> was<00:02:08.250> fun

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:08.610 
wasn't it was an ideal but uh it was fun

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:10.369 
wasn't it was an ideal but uh it was fun
and<00:02:09.000> I<00:02:09.149> suppose<00:02:09.300> that's<00:02:09.450> the<00:02:09.599> point<00:02:09.720> of<00:02:09.989> doing

00:02:10.369 --> 00:02:10.379 
and I suppose that's the point of doing

00:02:10.379 --> 00:02:12.589 
and I suppose that's the point of doing
an<00:02:10.590> exam<00:02:10.830> for<00:02:11.250> fun<00:02:11.520> so<00:02:11.970> upon<00:02:12.120> having<00:02:12.209> that<00:02:12.420> fun

00:02:12.589 --> 00:02:12.599 
an exam for fun so upon having that fun

00:02:12.599 --> 00:02:13.570 
an exam for fun so upon having that fun
there<00:02:12.780> was<00:02:12.870> absolutely<00:02:13.230> no

00:02:13.570 --> 00:02:13.580 
there was absolutely no

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:15.460 
there was absolutely no
because<00:02:13.970> the<00:02:14.120> next<00:02:14.480> the<00:02:14.870> next<00:02:15.110> day<00:02:15.230> I<00:02:15.260> had

00:02:15.460 --> 00:02:15.470 
because the next the next day I had

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:17.470 
because the next the next day I had
Chinese<00:02:16.160> politics<00:02:16.790> in<00:02:16.940> comparative

government in the other order

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:21.580 
government in the other order
comparative<00:02:20.210> government<00:02:20.570> could<00:02:21.290> be<00:02:21.320> two

00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:21.590 
comparative government could be two

00:02:21.590 --> 00:02:23.260 
comparative government could be two
papers<00:02:21.950> the<00:02:22.370> amount<00:02:22.580> of<00:02:22.670> material<00:02:23.090> that<00:02:23.120> you

papers the amount of material that you
need<00:02:23.300> to<00:02:23.540> know<00:02:23.660> is<00:02:23.900> quite<00:02:24.260> ridiculous<00:02:24.680> and<00:02:25.040> the

00:02:25.810 --> 00:02:25.820 
need to know is quite ridiculous and the

amount<00:02:26.000> that<00:02:26.030> you<00:02:26.150> need<00:02:26.270> to<00:02:26.360> know<00:02:26.450> for<00:02:26.540> China

00:02:26.740 --> 00:02:26.750 
amount that you need to know for China

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:28.750
