00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:50.190 
there's 50 seconds left in this quarter

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:52.670 
there's 50 seconds left in this quarter
really<00:00:51.180> i've<00:00:51.329> just<00:00:51.570> had<00:00:51.719> to<00:00:51.899> sit<00:00:52.140> here<00:00:52.410> well

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:52.680 
really i've just had to sit here well

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:55.880 
really i've just had to sit here well
these<00:00:52.980> two<00:00:53.210> pairs<00:00:54.210> of<00:00:54.329> shorts<00:00:54.809> just<00:00:55.140> grind<00:00:55.620> on

00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:55.890 
these two pairs of shorts just grind on

00:00:55.890 --> 00:00:57.920 
these two pairs of shorts just grind on
each<00:00:55.920> other<00:00:56.340> so<00:00:56.699> it<00:00:56.789> was<00:00:56.850> kind<00:00:57.149> of<00:00:57.270> awkward<00:00:57.449> but

00:00:57.920 --> 00:00:57.930 
each other so it was kind of awkward but

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:01.099 
each other so it was kind of awkward but
I'm<00:00:58.170> figuring<00:00:58.559> that<00:00:59.070> this<00:00:59.570> glitch<00:01:00.570> will<00:01:00.930> be

00:01:01.099 --> 00:01:01.109 
I'm figuring that this glitch will be

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:02.869 
I'm figuring that this glitch will be
over<00:01:01.559> here<00:01:01.920> at<00:01:02.039> the<00:01:02.160> end<00:01:02.280> of<00:01:02.370> the<00:01:02.460> quarter

00:01:02.869 --> 00:01:02.879 
over here at the end of the quarter

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:05.960 
over here at the end of the quarter
although<00:01:03.300> my<00:01:03.830> stats<00:01:04.830> really<00:01:05.519> missed<00:01:05.820> the

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:05.970 
although my stats really missed the

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:07.910 
although my stats really missed the
chance<00:01:06.180> to<00:01:06.420> build<00:01:06.600> them<00:01:06.810> up<00:01:06.840> but<00:01:07.320> I<00:01:07.680> really

00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:07.920 
chance to build them up but I really

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:10.730 
chance to build them up but I really
wanted<00:01:08.250> to<00:01:08.549> stick<00:01:08.790> around<00:01:08.820> to<00:01:09.240> see<00:01:09.479> what<00:01:09.740> would

00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:10.740 
wanted to stick around to see what would

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:14.710 
wanted to stick around to see what would
happen<00:01:10.799> here<00:01:11.549> so<00:01:12.180> I<00:01:12.210> got<00:01:12.420> 25<00:01:12.900> seconds<00:01:13.500> left

00:01:14.710 --> 00:01:14.720 
happen here so I got 25 seconds left

00:01:14.720 --> 00:01:17.120 
happen here so I got 25 seconds left
overall<00:01:15.720> like<00:01:15.960> I<00:01:16.110> said<00:01:16.320> impressions<00:01:16.860> of<00:01:16.979> the

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:17.130 
overall like I said impressions of the

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:19.609 
overall like I said impressions of the
game<00:01:17.310> are<00:01:17.490> pretty<00:01:17.759> good<00:01:18.110> had<00:01:19.110> a<00:01:19.140> lot<00:01:19.350> of<00:01:19.380> online

issues<00:01:20.460> already<00:01:21.080> but<00:01:22.080> they<00:01:22.170> have<00:01:22.320> changed<00:01:22.619> a

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:22.950 
issues already but they have changed a

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:24.830 
issues already but they have changed a
lot<00:01:23.130> of<00:01:23.340> things<00:01:23.580> as<00:01:23.970> far<00:01:24.210> as<00:01:24.360> it's<00:01:24.540> a<00:01:24.630> lot

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:24.840 
lot of things as far as it's a lot

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:26.690 
lot of things as far as it's a lot
harder<00:01:25.020> to<00:01:25.290> pass<00:01:25.470> i'm<00:01:25.860> sure<00:01:26.040> a<00:01:26.070> lot<00:01:26.220> of<00:01:26.280> you<00:01:26.490> saw

harder to pass i'm sure a lot of you saw

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:28.550 
harder to pass i'm sure a lot of you saw
that<00:01:26.909> in<00:01:27.090> the<00:01:27.119> demo<00:01:27.450> you<00:01:28.170> have<00:01:28.290> to<00:01:28.409> be<00:01:28.530> very

00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:28.560 
that in the demo you have to be very

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:30.289 
that in the demo you have to be very
smart<00:01:29.009> about<00:01:29.159> your<00:01:29.430> passes<00:01:29.850> don't<00:01:30.119> make

00:01:30.289 --> 00:01:30.299 
smart about your passes don't make

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:33.020 
smart about your passes don't make
cross-court<00:01:30.900> passes<00:01:31.460> you<00:01:32.460> can't<00:01:32.670> you<00:01:32.909> buy

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:33.030 
cross-court passes you can't you buy

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:34.789 
cross-court passes you can't you buy
with<00:01:33.210> that<00:01:33.329> kind<00:01:33.570> of<00:01:33.630> stuff<00:01:33.900> the<00:01:34.200> computer

00:01:34.789 --> 00:01:34.799 
with that kind of stuff the computer

00:01:34.799 --> 00:01:38.539 
with that kind of stuff the computer
stops<00:01:35.070> the<00:01:35.340> baseline<00:01:35.850> spam<00:01:37.100> those<00:01:38.100> are<00:01:38.250> just<00:01:38.340> a

00:01:38.539 --> 00:01:38.549 
stops the baseline spam those are just a

00:01:38.549 --> 00:01:41.510 
stops the baseline spam those are just a
few<00:01:38.880> quick<00:01:39.390> observations<00:01:40.229> alright<00:01:40.799> as<00:01:40.950> we<00:01:41.340> can

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:41.520 
few quick observations alright as we can

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:45.649 
few quick observations alright as we can
see<00:01:41.700> the<00:01:41.850> quarters<00:01:42.240> ended<00:01:42.329> here<00:01:44.509> shorts<00:01:45.509> guy

00:01:45.649 --> 00:01:45.659 
see the quarters ended here shorts guy

00:01:45.659 --> 00:01:48.830 
see the quarters ended here shorts guy
is<00:01:45.720> still<00:01:46.110> running<00:01:46.380> around

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:48.840 

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:50.749 

and<00:01:48.960> doesn't<00:01:49.740> look<00:01:50.100> like<00:01:50.340> we're<00:01:50.579> going

00:01:50.749 --> 00:01:50.759 
and doesn't look like we're going

00:01:50.759 --> 00:01:58.190 
and doesn't look like we're going
anywhere<00:01:51.030> so<00:01:53.509> i<00:01:54.710> guess<00:01:55.710> i<00:01:56.250> will<00:01:56.579> see<00:01:57.450> i<00:01:57.899> will

00:01:58.190 --> 00:01:58.200 
anywhere so i guess i will see i will

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:00.050 
anywhere so i guess i will see i will
save<00:01:58.679> an<00:01:58.829> exit<00:01:59.189> game<00:01:59.369> actually<00:01:59.579> not<00:01:59.819> letting

00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:00.060 
save an exit game actually not letting

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:02.929 
save an exit game actually not letting
me<00:02:00.149> so<00:02:00.750> the<00:02:01.079> only<00:02:01.200> option<00:02:01.289> is<00:02:01.530> to<00:02:01.590> quit<00:02:01.770> game<00:02:01.950> so

00:02:02.929 --> 00:02:02.939 
me so the only option is to quit game so

00:02:02.939 --> 00:02:04.099 
me so the only option is to quit game so
i<00:02:02.969> have<00:02:03.179> to<00:02:03.299> start<00:02:03.479> out<00:02:03.569> one<00:02:03.659> over<00:02:03.810> and<00:02:03.899> it<00:02:03.990> was

00:02:04.099 --> 00:02:04.109 
i have to start out one over and it was

00:02:04.109 --> 00:02:06.319 
i have to start out one over and it was
in<00:02:04.409> the<00:02:04.530> middle<00:02:04.710> of<00:02:04.799> the<00:02:04.860> third<00:02:05.100> but<00:02:05.280> it<00:02:06.179> is

00:02:06.319 --> 00:02:06.329 
in the middle of the third but it is

00:02:06.329 --> 00:02:07.999 
in the middle of the third but it is
