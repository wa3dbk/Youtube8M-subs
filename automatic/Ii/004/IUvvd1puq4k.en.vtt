hi guys this is my first world of
warcraft<00:00:07.820> 3d<00:00:08.820> fingerprint<00:00:09.830> it's<00:00:10.830> and<00:00:11.099> wharf

00:00:11.860 --> 00:00:11.870 
warcraft 3d fingerprint it's and wharf

warcraft 3d fingerprint it's and wharf
warrior<00:00:13.130> and<00:00:15.680> let<00:00:16.680> me<00:00:16.890> just<00:00:17.160> say<00:00:17.490> that<00:00:18.180> the

00:00:18.590 --> 00:00:18.600 
warrior and let me just say that the

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:20.300 
warrior and let me just say that the
reason<00:00:18.869> one<00:00:19.470> of<00:00:19.590> the<00:00:19.710> reasons<00:00:20.070> that<00:00:20.100> I'm

00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:20.310 
reason one of the reasons that I'm

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:24.130 
reason one of the reasons that I'm
printing<00:00:20.640> these<00:00:21.050> 3d<00:00:22.050> models<00:00:22.529> it's<00:00:22.800> because

00:00:24.130 --> 00:00:24.140 
printing these 3d models it's because

00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:27.349 
printing these 3d models it's because
fingerprints<00:00:25.279> doesn't<00:00:26.279> ship<00:00:26.580> to<00:00:26.789> my<00:00:26.939> country

00:00:27.349 --> 00:00:27.359 
fingerprints doesn't ship to my country

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:29.599 
fingerprints doesn't ship to my country
with<00:00:27.510> your<00:00:27.630> Cypress<00:00:28.199> so<00:00:28.439> in<00:00:28.619> a<00:00:28.710> way<00:00:28.890> I'm<00:00:29.039> forced

00:00:29.599 --> 00:00:29.609 
with your Cypress so in a way I'm forced

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:31.490 
with your Cypress so in a way I'm forced
to<00:00:29.779> print<00:00:30.779> them<00:00:30.929> myself

00:00:31.490 --> 00:00:31.500 
to print them myself

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:33.380 
to print them myself
otherwise<00:00:31.980> I<00:00:32.219> would<00:00:32.399> have<00:00:32.550> bought<00:00:32.759> several

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:33.390 
otherwise I would have bought several

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:38.500 
otherwise I would have bought several

from their website of course some
printing<00:00:39.510> them<00:00:39.660> myself<00:00:39.899> it's<00:00:40.290> an<00:00:40.410> interesting

00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:40.890 
printing them myself it's an interesting

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:42.889 
printing them myself it's an interesting

order to in order for the software that

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:03.200 
order to in order for the software that
is<00:01:00.270> linked<00:01:00.539> to<00:01:00.660> the<00:01:00.840> 3d<00:01:01.289> printer<00:01:01.680> to<00:01:02.210> actually

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:03.210 
is linked to the 3d printer to actually

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:05.270 
is linked to the 3d printer to actually
recognize<00:01:03.420> a<00:01:03.780> 3d<00:01:04.229> model<00:01:04.530> and<00:01:04.680> print<00:01:05.040> it

00:01:05.270 --> 00:01:05.280 
recognize a 3d model and print it

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:09.260 
recognize a 3d model and print it
correctly<00:01:07.189> the<00:01:08.189> other<00:01:08.340> reason<00:01:08.970> that<00:01:09.000> I'm

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:09.270 
correctly the other reason that I'm

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:12.679 
correctly the other reason that I'm
printing<00:01:09.510> them<00:01:09.750> myself<00:01:10.049> it's<00:01:10.830> because<00:01:11.729> figure

00:01:12.679 --> 00:01:12.689 
printing them myself it's because figure

00:01:12.689 --> 00:01:17.120 
printing them myself it's because figure
prints<00:01:13.080> will<00:01:13.229> not<00:01:13.710> print<00:01:14.070> them<00:01:15.259> in<00:01:16.259> a<00:01:16.740> low

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:17.130 
prints will not print them in a low

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:19.880 
prints will not print them in a low
polygon<00:01:17.790> format<00:01:18.570> which<00:01:18.840> is<00:01:18.869> the<00:01:19.140> format<00:01:19.320> that

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:19.890 
polygon format which is the format that

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:25.090 
polygon format which is the format that
the<00:01:20.610> World<00:01:21.240> of<00:01:21.390> Warcraft<00:01:22.220> game<00:01:23.220> models<00:01:23.700> come

00:01:25.090 --> 00:01:25.100 
the World of Warcraft game models come

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:27.649 
the World of Warcraft game models come
they<00:01:26.100> will<00:01:26.280> actually<00:01:27.000> increase<00:01:27.330> their

00:01:27.649 --> 00:01:27.659 
they will actually increase their

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:30.260 
they will actually increase their
polygon<00:01:28.350> counts<00:01:29.009> so<00:01:29.310> they<00:01:29.520> can<00:01:29.759> give<00:01:30.060> their

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:30.270 
polygon counts so they can give their

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:35.109 
polygon counts so they can give their
models<00:01:30.659> a<00:01:30.780> more<00:01:31.020> roundish<00:01:31.680> a<00:01:31.950> more<00:01:32.579> realistic

00:01:35.109 --> 00:01:35.119 

00:01:35.119 --> 00:01:40.310 

final<00:01:36.119> touch<00:01:36.450> effect<00:01:37.229> whereas<00:01:38.220> I<00:01:39.150> really<00:01:40.049> like

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:40.320 
final touch effect whereas I really like

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:43.819 
final touch effect whereas I really like
this<00:01:41.030> hard<00:01:42.030> touch<00:01:42.390> low<00:01:42.720> polygon<00:01:43.200> effect<00:01:43.649> that

00:01:43.819 --> 00:01:43.829 
this hard touch low polygon effect that

00:01:43.829 --> 00:01:47.749 
this hard touch low polygon effect that
the<00:01:43.950> models<00:01:44.340> have<00:01:44.549> so<00:01:45.240> I<00:01:46.170> chose<00:01:47.040> to<00:01:47.369> predict

00:01:47.749 --> 00:01:47.759 
the models have so I chose to predict

00:01:47.759 --> 00:01:53.120 
the models have so I chose to predict
what<00:01:48.210> to<00:01:48.360> print<00:01:48.570> them<00:01:49.759> exactly<00:01:50.759> as<00:01:51.229> they<00:01:52.229> come

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:53.130 
what to print them exactly as they come

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:57.109 
what to print them exactly as they come
out<00:01:53.159> from<00:01:53.490> the<00:01:53.899> from<00:01:54.899> the<00:01:55.020> game<00:01:55.259> and<00:01:55.909> if<00:01:56.909> you

00:01:57.109 --> 00:01:57.119 
out from the from the game and if you

00:01:57.119 --> 00:02:00.170 
out from the from the game and if you
are<00:01:57.180> going<00:01:57.390> to<00:01:57.570> check<00:01:57.899> my<00:01:58.680> previous<00:01:59.460> videos<00:01:59.850> on

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:00.180 
are going to check my previous videos on

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:04.969 
are going to check my previous videos on
my<00:02:00.630> 3d<00:02:01.619> model<00:02:02.930> prints<00:02:03.930> are<00:02:04.079> going<00:02:04.290> to<00:02:04.469> see<00:02:04.680> that

00:02:04.969 --> 00:02:04.979 
my 3d model prints are going to see that

00:02:04.979 --> 00:02:07.190 
my 3d model prints are going to see that
they<00:02:05.399> are<00:02:05.640> printed<00:02:06.119> on<00:02:06.240> the<00:02:06.299> same<00:02:06.479> principle

00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:07.200 
they are printed on the same principle

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:08.840 
they are printed on the same principle
and<00:02:07.320> on<00:02:07.439> the<00:02:07.590> same

00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:08.850 
and on the same

00:02:08.850 --> 00:02:14.550 
and on the same
philosophy<00:02:11.310> so<00:02:12.310> this<00:02:13.030> is<00:02:13.210> my<00:02:13.420> first<00:02:13.810> World<00:02:14.410> of

00:02:14.550 --> 00:02:14.560 
philosophy so this is my first World of

00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:16.740 
philosophy so this is my first World of
Warcraft<00:02:15.070> freedom<00:02:15.760> model<00:02:15.910> I<00:02:16.180> hope<00:02:16.420> you
