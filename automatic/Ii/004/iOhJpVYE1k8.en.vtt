00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:53.150
 2013 new model technology from distrust Come code banksy shape 

00:00:48.859 --> 00:00:58.580
 Category is Oran series model name is loop 

00:00:53.150 --> 00:01:01.550
 Orlando series Justice is proposed in the Japanese beach briefs splits flakes 

00:00:58.580 --> 00:01:04.659
 Can also demonstrate its performance firmly 

00:01:01.550 --> 00:01:10.420
 It is an all-in-one universal model 

00:01:04.659 --> 00:01:13.070
 Follow your head from the waves of the knees and hips and its performance with delicate jinging tailored to individual levels 

00:01:10.420 --> 00:01:19.650
 Demonstrate full 

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:24.530
 Outline made a line which gave the bulge as a whole a little left straight 

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:29.390
 Tax payment Lya made wide point a bit wider 

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:30.630
 a 8 is put a kick in much can be seen from one stroke taking advantage of the characteristics of the round squash 

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:36.990
 Was 

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:40.009
 Soli Lockers, which are important in Sanford's performance, are generally aligned with beach breaks 

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:40.009
 I felt a drop 

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:46.850
 Another important factor in the performance of the meeting mode is the gold cape 20 cm from the nose 

00:01:46.040 --> 00:01:50.450
 Up to 

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:58.370
 Be aware of the flow of water by digging into the Rippon cape 

00:01:50.450 --> 00:02:03.350
 We made a unique kick to have a rotation of digging the site over the regular command 

00:01:58.370 --> 00:02:05.909
 This loop with a size of about 5 eleven, as in the case of the normal all-round model 

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:10.560
 Model will also be used 

00:02:05.909 --> 00:02:15.330
 This time I was conscious of the standard that anyone could get on my model 

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:17.700
 This model, which upgraded the current in home model, is a Japanese beach 

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:23.340
 Set the standard completely to the break 

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:25.930
 Focus on the flow and softness of the water and create a clean , no-outline outline curve 

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:33.170
 And from the deep single rhizome 

00:02:25.930 --> 00:02:39.489
 It is one of the features that feels like sticking to the shape push-up legs in Asai silent root cape 

00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:45.410
 Depending on the rider, this model can be run at 10 o'clock and can be faithfully controlled to his own intention. 

00:02:39.489 --> 00:02:48.020
 Approach to a wide range of people depending on the size of course with content and chin 

00:02:45.410 --> 00:02:52.520
 All-in-one model 

00:02:48.020 --> 00:02:59.740
 I think that it will definitely be active in the competition scene 

00:02:52.520 --> 00:02:59.740
 Also this one can also recommended for those who are seeking, such as the future of the step-up
