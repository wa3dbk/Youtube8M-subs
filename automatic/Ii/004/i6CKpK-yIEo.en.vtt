00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:09.809
 quick 

00:00:08.309 --> 00:00:11.880
 today we are going to make the recipe 

00:00:09.809 --> 00:00:14.759
 combed to the Coconut go 

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:16.500
 cooking is gone for the recipe of 

00:00:14.759 --> 00:00:18.900
 our coconut donuts he goes 

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:20.689
 we need two whole eggs of 10 g 

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:24.090
 melted butter 

00:00:20.689 --> 00:00:27.240
 100 g caster sugar a spoon 

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:30.060
 liquid vanilla soup 200 g walnuts 

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:33.450
 grated coconut and oil for our 

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:39.719
 frying we will start there our 

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:41.719
 contest we will put the sugar on 

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:44.820
 melted butter 

00:00:41.719 --> 00:00:47.160
 there I will break but 2nd in a 

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:49.640
 container to have to avoid putting 

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:49.640
 Shells 

00:00:53.760 --> 00:01:00.809
 so I put my tablespoon of 

00:00:56.429 --> 00:01:03.800
 liquid vanilla and so I will mix 

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:03.800
 to get a paste 

00:01:04.399 --> 00:01:14.490
 this is our paw to deform so we 

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:18.600
 get to the ball so m if you 

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:19.860
 see that the dough does not form a mold 

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:22.890
 you can always add a little 

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:24.210
 little more coconut up 

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:27.390
 to have this consistency 

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:32.250
 So that's what we're going to do 

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:34.560
 put them in the same shape and we 

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:35.850
 will then put them in the fridge during 

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:37.319
 about half an hour or so at 

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:41.330
 freezer for a quarter of an hour 

00:01:37.319 --> 00:01:41.330
 for them to firm up properly 

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:47.030
 we're going to put them now at 

00:01:44.750 --> 00:01:49.510
 freezer for about 15 

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:49.510
 minutes 

00:01:50.380 --> 00:01:56.330
 so our donut dough so good 

00:01:53.870 --> 00:02:00.740
 cooled I warmed up so my 

00:01:56.330 --> 00:02:03.950
 oil at its 70 170 degrees was worth by 

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:06.550
 3 and as soon as it colors in them we 

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:06.550
 remove right away huh 

00:02:10.519 --> 00:02:18.000
 so there it really takes some 

00:02:12.629 --> 00:02:22.170
 seconds that's one gets a beautiful 

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:24.409
 coloring and so I plunged them 

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:24.409

00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:37.890
