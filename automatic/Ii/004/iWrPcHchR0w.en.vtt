let's<00:04:17.829> go<00:04:17.979> out<00:04:18.099> to<00:04:18.160> one<00:04:18.250> of<00:04:18.310> the<00:04:18.430> variants<00:04:18.989> this

00:04:19.979 --> 00:04:19.989 
let's go out to one of the variants this

00:04:19.989 --> 00:04:22.249 
let's go out to one of the variants this
is<00:04:20.199> the<00:04:20.410> green<00:04:20.859> and<00:04:20.979> yellow<00:04:21.070> version<00:04:21.579> of<00:04:21.699> Vega

00:04:22.249 --> 00:04:22.259 
is the green and yellow version of Vega

00:04:22.259 --> 00:04:24.839 
is the green and yellow version of Vega
the<00:04:23.259> only<00:04:23.770> difference<00:04:24.160> for<00:04:24.280> this<00:04:24.430> figure<00:04:24.729> is

00:04:24.839 --> 00:04:24.849 
the only difference for this figure is

00:04:24.849 --> 00:04:26.879 
the only difference for this figure is
the<00:04:25.000> alternate<00:04:25.360> head<00:04:25.539> the<00:04:25.690> unmasked<00:04:26.259> head<00:04:26.440> has

00:04:26.879 --> 00:04:26.889 
the alternate head the unmasked head has

00:04:26.889 --> 00:04:29.969 
the alternate head the unmasked head has
a<00:04:26.919> variant<00:04:27.490> head<00:04:27.759> with<00:04:28.750> or<00:04:29.289> is<00:04:29.500> a<00:04:29.530> variant<00:04:29.949> that

00:04:29.969 --> 00:04:29.979 
a variant head with or is a variant that

00:04:29.979 --> 00:04:31.620 
a variant head with or is a variant that
I<00:04:30.099> should<00:04:30.310> say<00:04:30.490> which<00:04:30.699> has<00:04:30.729> him<00:04:31.090> with<00:04:31.509> his

00:04:31.620 --> 00:04:31.630 
I should say which has him with his

00:04:31.630 --> 00:04:34.969 
I should say which has him with his
tongue<00:04:31.840> out<00:04:31.990> looking<00:04:32.410> his<00:04:32.440> lips

00:04:34.969 --> 00:04:34.979 

00:04:34.979 --> 00:04:39.360 

kind<00:04:35.979> of<00:04:36.039> cool<00:04:36.220> well<00:04:36.729> it's<00:04:37.090> just<00:04:37.150> unique<00:04:38.039> so<00:04:39.039> I

00:04:39.360 --> 00:04:39.370 
kind of cool well it's just unique so I

00:04:39.370 --> 00:04:41.430 
kind of cool well it's just unique so I
display<00:04:39.820> this<00:04:40.000> one<00:04:40.210> with<00:04:40.570> the<00:04:40.720> unmasked<00:04:41.289> head

00:04:41.430 --> 00:04:41.440 
display this one with the unmasked head

00:04:41.440 --> 00:04:42.510 
display this one with the unmasked head
just<00:04:41.620> because<00:04:41.740> it's<00:04:42.010> different<00:04:42.190> than<00:04:42.370> the

00:04:42.510 --> 00:04:42.520 
just because it's different than the

00:04:42.520 --> 00:04:47.010 
just because it's different than the
other<00:04:42.669> one<00:04:43.919> and<00:04:45.389> other<00:04:46.389> than<00:04:46.599> that<00:04:46.659> he's<00:04:46.930> the

00:04:47.010 --> 00:04:47.020 
other one and other than that he's the

00:04:47.020 --> 00:04:48.360 
other one and other than that he's the
same<00:04:47.169> figure<00:04:47.500> he's<00:04:47.650> got<00:04:47.770> the<00:04:47.860> green<00:04:48.070> pants

00:04:48.360 --> 00:04:48.370 
same figure he's got the green pants

00:04:48.370 --> 00:04:49.980 
same figure he's got the green pants
with<00:04:48.550> the<00:04:48.639> yellow<00:04:48.880> stripe<00:04:49.180> the<00:04:49.479> green<00:04:49.659> snake

00:04:49.980 --> 00:04:49.990 
with the yellow stripe the green snake

00:04:49.990 --> 00:04:52.589 
with the yellow stripe the green snake
and<00:04:50.229> the<00:04:50.590> alternate<00:04:51.039> head<00:04:51.190> has<00:04:51.400> the<00:04:51.669> green

00:04:52.589 --> 00:04:52.599 
and the alternate head has the green

00:04:52.599 --> 00:04:55.170 
and the alternate head has the green
detail<00:04:53.020> on<00:04:53.169> the<00:04:53.260> mask<00:04:53.550> so<00:04:54.550> that's<00:04:54.880> a<00:04:54.970> cool

00:04:55.170 --> 00:04:55.180 
detail on the mask so that's a cool

00:04:55.180 --> 00:04:57.480 
detail on the mask so that's a cool
version<00:04:55.419> a<00:04:55.840> lot<00:04:56.800> of<00:04:56.889> people<00:04:57.070> think<00:04:57.280> that<00:04:57.340> the

00:04:57.480 --> 00:04:57.490 
version a lot of people think that the

00:04:57.490 --> 00:04:59.010 
version a lot of people think that the
green<00:04:57.669> version<00:04:57.970> is<00:04:58.240> two<00:04:58.360> player<00:04:58.539> one<00:04:58.780> color

00:04:59.010 --> 00:04:59.020 
green version is two player one color

00:04:59.020 --> 00:05:01.020 
green version is two player one color
but<00:04:59.229> it's<00:04:59.349> not<00:04:59.550> that<00:05:00.550> guy<00:05:00.639> supposed<00:05:00.880> to<00:05:00.909> be

00:05:01.020 --> 00:05:01.030 
but it's not that guy supposed to be

00:05:01.030 --> 00:05:02.909 
but it's not that guy supposed to be
purple<00:05:01.300> and<00:05:01.360> yellow<00:05:01.539> the<00:05:02.020> green<00:05:02.229> is<00:05:02.409> player<00:05:02.680> 2

00:05:02.909 --> 00:05:02.919 
purple and yellow the green is player 2

00:05:02.919 --> 00:05:05.700 
purple and yellow the green is player 2
then<00:05:03.159> we<00:05:04.060> have<00:05:04.270> the<00:05:04.599> black<00:05:05.349> and<00:05:05.590> yellow

00:05:05.700 --> 00:05:05.710 
then we have the black and yellow

00:05:05.710 --> 00:05:07.409 
then we have the black and yellow
version<00:05:06.250> or<00:05:06.400> dark<00:05:06.639> grey<00:05:06.820> I<00:05:06.849> guess<00:05:07.150> I<00:05:07.240> should

00:05:07.409 --> 00:05:07.419 
version or dark grey I guess I should

00:05:07.419 --> 00:05:10.589 
version or dark grey I guess I should
say<00:05:08.130> same<00:05:09.130> exact<00:05:09.430> figure<00:05:09.729> is<00:05:09.789> player<00:05:10.120> 1<00:05:10.360> just

00:05:10.589 --> 00:05:10.599 
say same exact figure is player 1 just

00:05:10.599 --> 00:05:13.260 
say same exact figure is player 1 just
different<00:05:10.870> color<00:05:11.020> pants<00:05:11.440> and<00:05:12.039> snake<00:05:12.370> and<00:05:12.639> face

00:05:13.270 --> 00:05:15.480 
different color pants and snake and face

00:05:15.480 --> 00:05:15.490 
mask so then just have them in a little

00:05:15.490 --> 00:05:18.540 
mask so then just have them in a little
poke<00:05:15.729> so<00:05:15.940> you<00:05:16.030> can<00:05:16.180> see<00:05:16.770> very<00:05:17.770> dynamic<00:05:18.280> looking

00:05:18.540 --> 00:05:18.550 
poke so you can see very dynamic looking

00:05:18.550 --> 00:05:21.390 
poke so you can see very dynamic looking
figure<00:05:19.050> pretty<00:05:20.050> cool<00:05:20.259> I<00:05:20.470> like<00:05:20.710> having<00:05:21.190> him<00:05:21.280> in

00:05:21.390 --> 00:05:21.400 
figure pretty cool I like having him in

00:05:21.400 --> 00:05:23.219 
figure pretty cool I like having him in
some<00:05:21.580> different<00:05:21.880> poses<00:05:22.060> especially<00:05:23.020> with<00:05:23.139> the

00:05:23.219 --> 00:05:23.229 
some different poses especially with the

00:05:23.229 --> 00:05:23.870 
some different poses especially with the
claw

00:05:23.870 --> 00:05:23.880 
claw

00:05:23.880 --> 00:05:27.930 
claw
there's<00:05:24.880> the<00:05:25.210> gray<00:05:25.720> version<00:05:26.460> and<00:05:27.460> finally<00:05:27.789> we

00:05:27.930 --> 00:05:27.940 
there's the gray version and finally we

00:05:27.940 --> 00:05:32.330 
there's the gray version and finally we
have<00:05:28.090> the<00:05:28.300> red<00:05:28.570> GameStop<00:05:29.440> exclusive<00:05:30.220> version

00:05:35.520 --> 00:05:35.530 
again everything is all the same the

00:05:35.530 --> 00:05:37.890 
again everything is all the same the
only<00:05:35.590> difference<00:05:35.740> is<00:05:36.159> the<00:05:36.340> color<00:05:36.610> the<00:05:37.389> red<00:05:37.599> on

00:05:37.890 --> 00:05:37.900 
only difference is the color the red on

00:05:42.089 --> 00:05:42.099 
mask so there you have it there's the

00:05:42.099 --> 00:05:44.459 
mask so there you have it there's the
GameStop<00:05:42.729> exclusive<00:05:43.419> Vega<00:05:43.810> pretty<00:05:44.139> hard<00:05:44.380> to

come back nice looking figure I would

00:05:46.539 --> 00:05:49.200 
come back nice looking figure I would
say<00:05:47.130> let's<00:05:48.130> get<00:05:48.370> a<00:05:48.400> group<00:05:48.610> shot<00:05:48.849> of<00:05:49.029> all<00:05:49.180> the
