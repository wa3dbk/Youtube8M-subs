 well here just representing all the 

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:18.869
 Latin people I have American blood 

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:22.500
 here I am I feel that as told my 

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:25.140
 family jellyfish theme starting the end is 

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:28.470
 business because it's complicated for 

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:30.570
 want wright cupcake papers dress in 

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:33.920
 webcam tips because there's nothing 

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:33.920
 it will be complicated 

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:48.270
 my plans are to have a plan the plan 

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:50.010
 for sounds complicate are I have and if 

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:54.020
 before 

00:01:50.010 --> 00:01:57.020
 business gardens in different good 

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:57.020
 monsters 

00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:39.220
 no no no 

00:02:33.740 --> 00:02:39.220
 I do not know what 

00:02:39.730 --> 00:02:42.730
 tacos 

00:02:47.230 --> 00:02:51.280
 in masters 

00:02:58.390 --> 00:03:03.950
 nothing more to finish in a little 

00:03:00.820 --> 00:03:06.410
 about the cars how much the tires measure 

00:03:03.950 --> 00:03:08.360
 what speed they reach and before going to 

00:03:06.410 --> 00:03:11.060
 see it then as in form there is no in the 

00:03:08.360 --> 00:03:16.460
 track because a monster truck has the 

00:03:11.060 --> 00:03:21.320
 wheels are more than like a thousand pounds of 

00:03:16.460 --> 00:03:24.500
 weight so high makes the whole machine 

00:03:21.320 --> 00:03:27.800
 weighs more than 10,000 pounds has more than 

00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:31.610
 1,050 horsepower at what speed 

00:03:27.800 --> 00:03:34.790
 come that's more of a clear f1 and this 

00:03:31.610 --> 00:03:38.030
 is the only sport I all of 

00:03:34.790 --> 00:03:38.660
 autonomic or as mobile that you can 

00:03:38.030 --> 00:03:42.470
 run 

00:03:38.660 --> 00:03:45.440
 inside a flour the only fact is 

00:03:42.470 --> 00:03:49.190
 something for the whole family you can divide 

00:03:45.440 --> 00:03:52.490
 and to tell the truth the drugs 

00:03:49.190 --> 00:03:55.130
 monsters is a crazy thing to see in people 

00:03:52.490 --> 00:03:59.210
 so well let's go up and see a 

00:03:55.130 --> 00:04:02.800
 self onwards from inside and then 

00:03:59.210 --> 00:04:02.800
 let's see it in practice 

00:04:11.910 --> 00:04:15.270
 I do not know how many people have had the 

00:04:13.860 --> 00:04:16.690
 opportunity to be inside the bull 

00:04:15.270 --> 00:04:19.660
 crazy 

00:04:16.690 --> 00:04:23.050
 if from below it looks spectacular from here 

00:04:19.660 --> 00:04:25.120
 you see much more tubular cannon I 

00:04:23.050 --> 00:04:29.940
 imagine security belt 

00:04:25.120 --> 00:04:32.100
 security here is a turbo lever 

00:04:29.940 --> 00:04:33.840
 are in the tests at the ignition of 

00:04:32.100 --> 00:04:39.450
 the cars here is the bull's wheel 

00:04:33.840 --> 00:04:42.050
 crazy speedometer there are like liters here 

00:04:39.450 --> 00:04:46.670
 to put brake accelerator speed 

00:04:42.050 --> 00:04:46.670
 and obviously he 

00:04:46.960 --> 00:04:51.370
 the extinguisher is not important that there 

00:04:49.539 --> 00:04:52.419
 an extinguisher because if you see that here 

00:04:51.370 --> 00:04:54.970
 anything 

00:04:52.419 --> 00:04:57.069
 they are so big that if it's dangerous 

00:04:54.970 --> 00:04:58.840
 as the pilots do not say it is not something 

00:04:57.069 --> 00:05:00.819
 that anyone can do is 

00:04:58.840 --> 00:05:02.740
 spectacular to be up here from 

00:05:00.819 --> 00:05:05.889
 inside I think it's time for you to 

00:05:02.740 --> 00:05:08.199
 let's start to handle these are techniques 

00:05:05.889 --> 00:05:10.560
 driving a master track with 

00:05:08.199 --> 00:05:10.560
 Facebook 

00:05:49.020 --> 00:05:53.310
 and if they suddenly go on the road, 

00:05:50.789 --> 00:05:55.500
 worry when you think that some of these 

00:05:53.310 --> 00:05:56.910
 trucks of these monster trucks come 

00:05:55.500 --> 00:05:58.710
 towards the event and may bump into 

00:05:56.910 --> 00:06:01.530
 one of those have an accident because at 

00:05:58.710 --> 00:06:03.840
 traveling travel in these trailers and with 

00:06:01.530 --> 00:06:05.520
 these rims yes because he walks the 

00:06:03.840 --> 00:06:07.949
 transporting with those tires is 

00:06:05.520 --> 00:06:09.509
 until dangerous not and these trailers to 

00:06:07.949 --> 00:06:11.250
 get to the event end up being the 

00:06:09.509 --> 00:06:12.750
 workshop are equipped with everything 

00:06:11.250 --> 00:06:17.000
 necessary to meet any 

00:06:12.750 --> 00:06:17.000
 anomaly that happens with the master touch
