00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.680
 well we are following 

00:00:01.290 --> 00:00:09.390
 minecraft 1.8 let's make a mod a 

00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:11.280
 mod that adds little things to sell dogs 

00:00:09.390 --> 00:00:12.780
 and the odd one that's pretty 

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:15.270
 interesting let's see first the 

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:18.029
 torch of understanding torch is rare 

00:00:15.270 --> 00:00:20.630
 to hide from a stick and one of 

00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:22.310
 coal or char which give us 6 

00:00:20.630 --> 00:00:24.340
 and this is simply to put 

00:00:22.310 --> 00:00:27.550
 torch wait distance 

00:00:24.340 --> 00:00:35.010
 let's try it where we try it 

00:00:27.550 --> 00:00:37.380
 also the problem with this is that a 

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:39.690
 time 

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:41.990
 man for the tests is not that you 

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:41.990
 find 

00:00:42.980 --> 00:00:48.440
 with the grass does not work does not understand 

00:00:45.990 --> 00:00:51.500
 very well because here they do not fix you 

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:53.780
 the trunk if it can be can be 

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:55.260
 pretty useful especially in rabbis for 

00:00:53.780 --> 00:00:57.870
 example 

00:00:55.260 --> 00:01:01.140
 can place them like that on the other side of the 

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:02.070
 canyon by saying some rules can 

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:05.750
 be quite useful 

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:05.750
 then the underwater 

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:13.560
 and one ice we do two of these is 

00:01:10.909 --> 00:01:16.200
 good to see - use what I do not know 

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:17.900
 happens is spent on all this was spent 

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:21.470
 scream and creative 

00:01:17.900 --> 00:01:27.080
 and this did not see him so much use that 

00:01:21.470 --> 00:01:30.550
 now we do not launch the view and we create 

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:30.550
 water we do not create in cascade 

00:01:32.760 --> 00:01:41.070
 if the water 

00:01:38.020 --> 00:01:41.070
 but man for Ã¡lava 

00:01:41.680 --> 00:01:44.220
 do not 

00:01:44.830 --> 00:01:51.490
 because a valera 

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:53.350
 It's a bit weird, but I did not finish 

00:01:51.490 --> 00:01:55.760
 find it a very clear utility 

00:01:53.350 --> 00:01:59.390
 apart from this of lava for example 

00:01:55.760 --> 00:02:01.580
 I do not quite see it is the snow ndr 

00:01:59.390 --> 00:02:04.310
 is that it is with an ander but a little ball 

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:06.700
 of ice ice we make four and this 

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:09.190
 part of putting snow like that 

00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:10.929
 this and this can be done as normal 

00:02:09.190 --> 00:02:12.069
 you need the ball of this fact here 

00:02:10.929 --> 00:02:13.959
 is 

00:02:12.069 --> 00:02:15.700
 but now apart from doing this what 

00:02:13.959 --> 00:02:19.250
 yes what it does is that if we throw it in the 

00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:22.210
 ice does or is in the water they make ice 

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:22.210
 here it's worth 

00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:29.230
 as you can see, we can create ice that 

00:02:26.020 --> 00:02:33.550
 annoying and the good thing is that you spend one of 

00:02:29.230 --> 00:02:36.250
 ice an independent and they give us 4 

00:02:33.550 --> 00:02:39.400
 then we can and can do 

00:02:36.250 --> 00:02:41.260
 with an ice we make 4 ice which 

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:42.340
 No, it's not bad if you want to decorate and 

00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:44.550
 such 

00:02:42.340 --> 00:02:50.760
 but it is not good that if 

00:02:44.550 --> 00:02:50.760
 this can accumulate true let's go here 

00:02:52.780 --> 00:02:59.430
 How good to practice as I say 

00:02:57.569 --> 00:03:01.379
 but what he liked the most about creating 

00:02:59.430 --> 00:03:03.799
 ice really worth now let's see 

00:03:01.379 --> 00:03:03.799
 is here 

00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:12.740
 seeds and wheat we make four of these 

00:03:08.219 --> 00:03:15.260
 and this serves for this 

00:03:12.740 --> 00:03:17.450
 as you can see what it does not take away all of us 

00:03:15.260 --> 00:03:20.210
 and that's an operative what it does is 

00:03:17.450 --> 00:03:23.620
 catch all the wheat and seeds and the 

00:03:20.210 --> 00:03:25.739
 replanta give us four of this 

00:03:23.620 --> 00:03:28.420
 and that works a little weird that follows 

00:03:25.739 --> 00:03:30.280
 follow 

00:03:28.420 --> 00:03:32.010
 can be pretty cool in fact of what 

00:03:30.280 --> 00:03:33.420
 What I like most about the mod 

00:03:32.010 --> 00:03:34.830
 because they catch you all the wheat that 

00:03:33.420 --> 00:03:37.769
 stake out 3 and you have very plantations 

00:03:34.830 --> 00:03:39.060
 big even bigger than this you 

00:03:37.769 --> 00:03:41.819
 you do a few of these in the series 

00:03:39.060 --> 00:03:43.610
 besides for example I have to pour is 

00:03:41.819 --> 00:03:45.230
 to happen 

00:03:43.610 --> 00:03:49.310
 then this can work a lot 

00:03:45.230 --> 00:03:51.170
 cool guy, I'm cool 

00:03:49.310 --> 00:03:52.880
 and as you can see , everything is so different 

00:03:51.170 --> 00:03:54.739
 super cool and finally here is the 

00:03:52.880 --> 00:03:56.830
 leander lighting that is deeply 

00:03:54.739 --> 00:04:01.030
 hair a tear 

00:03:56.830 --> 00:04:01.030
 and this is simply lightning 

00:04:02.170 --> 00:04:09.269
 we do not just make one for each graphic 

00:04:07.620 --> 00:04:11.610
 how can it be fine if you want to have 

00:04:09.269 --> 00:04:13.830
 of pet a kripper to the pigs that 

00:04:11.610 --> 00:04:15.450
 they transform 

00:04:13.830 --> 00:04:17.850
 because this time if you want to have 

00:04:15.450 --> 00:04:20.209
 pet a kripper loaded there as if 

00:04:17.850 --> 00:04:23.419
 you had a show 

00:04:20.209 --> 00:04:24.770
 but in general this the ray me man to 

00:04:23.419 --> 00:04:28.300
 the best to hurt some bug 

00:04:24.770 --> 00:04:28.300
 but I do not see it very 

00:04:28.900 --> 00:04:32.740
 I do not see it as very useful, but 

00:04:31.240 --> 00:04:36.190
 good is says the mantle of his most curious 

00:04:32.740 --> 00:04:38.590
 I know what bothers me the most 

00:04:36.190 --> 00:04:40.180
 uncle to get food a button cool 

00:04:38.590 --> 00:04:41.740
 ruiz and to get food and 

00:04:40.180 --> 00:04:44.520
 rethinking it also works not only with 

00:04:41.740 --> 00:04:44.520
 this will also fulfill 

00:04:45.080 --> 00:04:51.400
 with carrot potato and with any 

00:04:47.470 --> 00:04:54.530
 This pileup that does not come out of mods 

00:04:51.400 --> 00:04:58.219
 which it is pretty good but good 

00:04:54.530 --> 00:05:00.669
 description will be 1.8 if the contra is 

00:04:58.219 --> 00:05:00.669
 as usual 

00:05:02.680 --> 00:05:05.680
 Show
