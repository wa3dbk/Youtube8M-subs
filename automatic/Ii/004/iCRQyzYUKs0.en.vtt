00:00:09.860 --> 00:00:09.870 
know I've talked about it before but I

00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:13.339 
know I've talked about it before but I
just<00:00:10.349> built<00:00:10.559> my<00:00:10.800> first<00:00:11.580> pc<00:00:12.420> but<00:00:12.960> graded<00:00:13.290> the

00:00:13.339 --> 00:00:13.349 
just built my first pc but graded the

00:00:13.349 --> 00:00:14.390 
just built my first pc but graded the
one<00:00:13.469> that<00:00:13.620> passed<00:00:13.830> we<00:00:14.040> want<00:00:14.190> a<00:00:14.219> size

00:00:14.390 --> 00:00:14.400 
one that passed we want a size

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:17.599 
one that passed we want a size
comparison<00:00:14.900> there's<00:00:15.900> that<00:00:16.170> one<00:00:16.410> but<00:00:17.220> this<00:00:17.490> is

00:00:17.599 --> 00:00:17.609 
comparison there's that one but this is

00:00:17.609 --> 00:00:19.450 
comparison there's that one but this is
the<00:00:17.699> first<00:00:17.730> one<00:00:18.029> I've<00:00:18.119> actually<00:00:18.270> built<00:00:18.690> so

00:00:19.450 --> 00:00:19.460 
the first one I've actually built so

00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:22.790 
the first one I've actually built so
it's<00:00:20.460> huge<00:00:20.910> it's<00:00:21.480> just<00:00:21.660> as<00:00:21.750> big<00:00:21.960> as<00:00:22.109> that<00:00:22.260> 24

00:00:22.790 --> 00:00:22.800 
it's huge it's just as big as that 24

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:24.230 
it's huge it's just as big as that 24
inch<00:00:22.920> monitor<00:00:23.010> and<00:00:23.519> it's<00:00:23.670> almost<00:00:23.910> as<00:00:24.029> big<00:00:24.210> as

00:00:24.230 --> 00:00:24.240 
inch monitor and it's almost as big as

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:27.500 
inch monitor and it's almost as big as
both<00:00:24.539> so<00:00:24.930> it's<00:00:25.500> pretty<00:00:25.619> crazy<00:00:25.890> let's<00:00:26.699> walk

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:27.510 
both so it's pretty crazy let's walk

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:29.990 
both so it's pretty crazy let's walk
around<00:00:27.570> and<00:00:28.410> I<00:00:29.130> just<00:00:29.369> want<00:00:29.519> to<00:00:29.580> give<00:00:29.760> you<00:00:29.789> kind

00:00:29.990 --> 00:00:30.000 
around and I just want to give you kind

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.049 
around and I just want to give you kind
of<00:00:30.090> a<00:00:30.349> build<00:00:31.349> log<00:00:31.700> because<00:00:32.700> I'm<00:00:32.850> going<00:00:32.940> to<00:00:33.000> be

00:00:33.049 --> 00:00:33.059 
of a build log because I'm going to be

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:36.590 
of a build log because I'm going to be
upgrading<00:00:33.600> in<00:00:34.050> the<00:00:34.320> future<00:00:34.770> and<00:00:35.360> yeah<00:00:36.360> thought

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:36.600 
upgrading in the future and yeah thought

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:39.650 
upgrading in the future and yeah thought

review<00:01:21.030> on<00:01:21.090> this<00:01:21.270> card<00:01:21.540> because<00:01:21.840> it's<00:01:22.470> kind<00:01:22.680> of

00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:22.740 
review on this card because it's kind of

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:25.490 
review on this card because it's kind of
insane<00:01:23.150> for<00:01:24.150> the<00:01:24.240> money<00:01:24.509> this<00:01:25.290> is<00:01:25.470> a

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:25.500 
insane for the money this is a

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:28.399 
insane for the money this is a
powerhouse<00:01:26.040> so<00:01:26.700> I<00:01:26.729> was<00:01:26.970> playing<00:01:27.299> metro<00:01:28.229> last

00:01:28.399 --> 00:01:28.409 
powerhouse so I was playing metro last

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:31.789 
powerhouse so I was playing metro last
light<00:01:28.619> at<00:01:29.810> mote<00:01:30.810> all<00:01:30.990> the<00:01:31.170> settings<00:01:31.439> turned<00:01:31.650> up

00:01:31.789 --> 00:01:31.799 
light at mote all the settings turned up

00:01:31.799 --> 00:01:36.170 
light at mote all the settings turned up
besides<00:01:32.189> advanced<00:01:32.939> physics<00:01:33.780> and<00:01:34.049> ssao<00:01:34.710> uh<00:01:35.180> and

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:36.180 
besides advanced physics and ssao uh and

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:39.170 
besides advanced physics and ssao uh and
but<00:01:36.810> we<00:01:36.930> were<00:01:37.020> downscaling<00:01:37.560> from<00:01:37.770> 2560<00:01:38.490> x<00:01:38.759> 1440

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:39.180 
but we were downscaling from 2560 x 1440

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:42.260 
but we were downscaling from 2560 x 1440
and<00:01:39.689> it<00:01:40.290> ran<00:01:40.619> well<00:01:41.159> over<00:01:41.430> 30<00:01:41.610> frames<00:01:41.820> a<00:01:41.939> second

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:42.270 
and it ran well over 30 frames a second

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:46.010 
and it ran well over 30 frames a second
mostly<00:01:43.049> up<00:01:43.350> upper<00:01:44.340> 60s<00:01:44.549> oh<00:01:45.000> it<00:01:45.240> was<00:01:45.360> doing

00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:46.020 
mostly up upper 60s oh it was doing

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:48.139 
mostly up upper 60s oh it was doing
really<00:01:46.140> well<00:01:46.380> we<00:01:47.040> have<00:01:47.159> 10<00:01:47.399> gigabytes<00:01:47.850> of<00:01:47.939> ram

00:01:48.139 --> 00:01:48.149 
really well we have 10 gigabytes of ram

00:01:48.149 --> 00:01:49.639 
really well we have 10 gigabytes of ram
i'll<00:01:48.420> be<00:01:48.540> upgrading<00:01:48.659> this<00:01:48.960> later<00:01:49.200> it<00:01:49.320> is<00:01:49.500> not

00:01:49.639 --> 00:01:49.649 
i'll be upgrading this later it is not

00:01:49.649 --> 00:01:53.960 
i'll be upgrading this later it is not
very<00:01:49.680> fast<00:01:50.070> just<00:01:50.490> stock<00:01:50.700> ram<00:01:52.280> as<00:01:53.280> you<00:01:53.640> can<00:01:53.790> read

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:53.970 
very fast just stock ram as you can read

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:57.380 
very fast just stock ram as you can read
that<00:01:54.210> coarser<00:01:54.659> CX<00:01:55.020> 600m<00:01:55.649> power<00:01:56.490> supply<00:01:56.939> we

00:01:57.380 --> 00:01:57.390 
that coarser CX 600m power supply we

00:01:57.390 --> 00:02:00.980 
that coarser CX 600m power supply we
have<00:01:57.509> one<00:01:57.719> terabyte<00:01:58.310> hitachi<00:01:59.310> drive<00:01:59.790> and<00:02:00.210> a

00:02:00.980 --> 00:02:00.990 
have one terabyte hitachi drive and a

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:04.249 
have one terabyte hitachi drive and a
DVD<00:02:01.710> Drive<00:02:02.040> so<00:02:02.850> the<00:02:03.540> reason<00:02:03.689> I<00:02:03.869> was<00:02:03.990> making

00:02:04.249 --> 00:02:04.259 
DVD Drive so the reason I was making

00:02:04.259 --> 00:02:06.429 
DVD Drive so the reason I was making
this<00:02:04.350> video<00:02:04.530> is<00:02:04.710> because<00:02:04.860> I<00:02:05.250> just<00:02:05.369> wanted<00:02:05.820> to

00:02:06.429 --> 00:02:06.439 
this video is because I just wanted to

00:02:06.439 --> 00:02:09.229 
this video is because I just wanted to
do<00:02:07.439> like<00:02:07.979> a<00:02:08.039> build<00:02:08.310> log<00:02:08.489> like<00:02:08.670> I<00:02:08.700> just<00:02:08.879> said<00:02:09.060> um

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:09.239 
do like a build log like I just said um

00:02:09.239 --> 00:02:12.830 
do like a build log like I just said um
cuz<00:02:10.170> it's<00:02:10.739> pretty<00:02:11.700> cool<00:02:11.910> to<00:02:11.970> me<00:02:12.090> to<00:02:12.690> be

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:12.840 
cuz it's pretty cool to me to be

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:13.800
