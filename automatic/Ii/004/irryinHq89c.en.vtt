cool<00:03:01.110> I<00:03:01.170> think<00:03:01.290> adds<00:03:01.620> a<00:03:01.739> lot<00:03:01.830> of<00:03:01.890> life<00:03:02.100> to<00:03:02.250> the

cool I think adds a lot of life to the

00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:03.530 
cool I think adds a lot of life to the
game<00:03:02.489> and<00:03:02.610> it<00:03:02.700> really<00:03:02.880> makes<00:03:03.090> the<00:03:03.180> game<00:03:03.330> just

00:03:03.530 --> 00:03:03.540 
game and it really makes the game just

00:03:03.540 --> 00:03:06.410 
game and it really makes the game just
just<00:03:03.900> a<00:03:04.019> little<00:03:04.319> bit<00:03:04.470> more<00:03:04.709> a<00:03:05.069> lot<00:03:05.850> long
