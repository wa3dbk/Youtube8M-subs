00:00:02.590 --> 00:00:10.700
 hello everyone with you again cool YouTube 

00:00:06.950 --> 00:00:12.500
 Today we'll tell you about how to ski 

00:00:10.700 --> 00:00:14.330
 skateboard ride an apron on 

00:00:12.500 --> 00:00:17.810
 rear wheels 

00:00:14.330 --> 00:00:20.689
 Also we today I will tell Polish 

00:00:17.810 --> 00:00:27.830
 skateboarder on my favorite edwards 

00:00:20.689 --> 00:00:31.250
 who is not withers and so at 40 cm and ride 

00:00:27.830 --> 00:00:34.820
 it was hard for me on wheels 

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:39.080
 because good is needed here 

00:00:34.820 --> 00:00:41.510
 balance and so first I will give you 

00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:42.290
 several exercises to do this 

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:46.850
 equilibrium 

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:50.860
 how to create a beginning we just can 

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:57.500
 stand on the rear wheels need to change a 

00:00:50.860 --> 00:01:00.040
 also we can rotate so can 

00:00:57.500 --> 00:01:03.229
 do on infinity eat a by morning 

00:01:00.040 --> 00:01:05.810
 360 hail is when you're on deck 

00:01:03.229 --> 00:01:09.850
 Werth advice revolves around you 

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:14.550
 I am so sorry and so 

00:01:09.850 --> 00:01:17.430
 to do to ride us 

00:01:14.550 --> 00:01:20.970
 flight we need to get up directly 

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:25.380
 the board can be sorted out slowly 

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:31.440
 you can accelerate with such a mad 

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:35.850
 speed is something that will be very difficult when 

00:01:31.440 --> 00:01:39.450
 will also not be very good on 

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:42.020
 front wheels will not be the same 

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:42.020
 easy to roll 

00:01:57.490 --> 00:02:05.810
 when we are with you 

00:01:59.149 --> 00:02:07.670
 we brake and so to say flies paint on 

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:11.709
 in fact, if you have a pot of stains 

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:13.940
 no big deal but if we are big 

00:02:11.709 --> 00:02:17.150
 high speed accelerates 

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:23.060
 and here it is so slow you can crumple it 

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:29.209
 nipples and a very strong blow by yourself when 

00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:35.959
 we roll the wheels almost the same 

00:02:29.209 --> 00:02:37.910
 when we are slowing down than we can hit luck 

00:02:35.959 --> 00:02:41.300
 all topic 

00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:41.870
 like it were front and rear 

00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:46.910
 wheels 

00:02:41.870 --> 00:02:51.320
 now we have learned to ride on the side 

00:02:46.910 --> 00:02:57.560
 in fact it is even easier than we 

00:02:51.320 --> 00:02:59.660
 we rest but when we do it we 

00:02:57.560 --> 00:03:04.319
 can turn either right or winds 

00:02:59.660 --> 00:03:06.420
 addition we can do 

00:03:04.319 --> 00:03:09.980
 we can make hands 

00:03:06.420 --> 00:03:09.980
 anyone as you like 

00:03:10.170 --> 00:03:14.520

00:03:12.030 --> 00:03:15.120

00:03:14.520 --> 00:03:22.090
 wheels 

00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:24.270
 And now a little garbage 3g 

00:03:22.090 --> 00:03:26.250

00:03:24.270 --> 00:03:28.800
 we are very late 

00:03:26.250 --> 00:03:30.690

00:03:28.800 --> 00:03:34.410

00:03:30.690 --> 00:03:38.820
