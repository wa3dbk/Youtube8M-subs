a-plus also controls the controls are a

00:04:29.370 --> 00:04:31.850 
a-plus also controls the controls are a
bit<00:04:29.550> finicky<00:04:29.940> and<00:04:30.240> can<00:04:30.780> be<00:04:30.930> somewhat<00:04:31.350> hard<00:04:31.680> to

00:04:31.850 --> 00:04:31.860 
bit finicky and can be somewhat hard to

00:04:31.860 --> 00:04:34.730 
bit finicky and can be somewhat hard to
pick<00:04:32.039> up<00:04:32.190> and<00:04:32.370> play<00:04:32.639> from<00:04:33.530> everything<00:04:34.530> else

00:04:34.730 --> 00:04:34.740 
pick up and play from everything else

00:04:34.740 --> 00:04:37.640

but<00:04:35.430> it's<00:04:35.729> not<00:04:36.060> that<00:04:36.300> bad<00:04:36.510> it's<00:04:36.960> easy<00:04:37.139> to<00:04:37.410> jump

00:04:37.640 --> 00:04:37.650 
but it's not that bad it's easy to jump

00:04:37.650 --> 00:04:40.790 
but it's not that bad it's easy to jump
into<00:04:37.889> and<00:04:38.360> after<00:04:39.360> a<00:04:39.389> while<00:04:39.630> you<00:04:39.960> can<00:04:40.110> pretty

00:04:40.790 --> 00:04:40.800 
into and after a while you can pretty

00:04:40.800 --> 00:04:43.990 
into and after a while you can pretty
much<00:04:40.919> master<00:04:41.699> the<00:04:41.910> controls<00:04:42.300> very<00:04:42.750> easily
