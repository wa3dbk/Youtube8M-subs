00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:52.560
 is to paint on the rubber so they can see 

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:56.100
 that the mordant the grip is perfect 

00:00:52.560 --> 00:00:58.350
 on this surface Well needless 

00:00:56.100 --> 00:01:01.440
 no primer only that the 

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:03.809
 footwear be clean mind well fine 

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:05.820
 Clean to work, you have to 

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:08.000
 room and start working around how 

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:10.920
 start we need the glazes 

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:14.070
 water acrylics and fiber brushes 

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:17.430
 Synthetic and the support to work 

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:19.290
 well I tell you here I have as 

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:23.250
 I told them it's a jack in which I put 

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:26.100
 let's recycle and I sketched with a pencil 

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:29.250
 more or less the drawings that I have in the 

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:32.009
 in the finished project without frame with 

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:35.700
 the pencil gently in different 

00:01:32.009 --> 00:01:39.330
 places where I'm going to change the 

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:42.360
 colors this is an easy way to 

00:01:39.330 --> 00:01:43.979
 mark and to get an idea of ​​how and 

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:47.310
 I will go repeating the color 

00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:49.649
 I usually start with the one that most 

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:52.200
 like it and I will interspersed once 

00:01:49.649 --> 00:01:54.299
 I complied with the whole cycle of colors 

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:56.979
 I come back with him 

00:01:54.299 --> 00:01:59.500
 in this case I have good my brush of 

00:01:56.979 --> 00:02:01.690
 synthetic fiber I'm going to moisten you 

00:01:59.500 --> 00:02:04.430
 I remove the excess water I will work 

00:02:01.690 --> 00:02:08.630
 with the color sand bayón 

00:02:04.430 --> 00:02:11.630
 the enamel to acrylic water water is 

00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:14.840
 of high healing power, notice that 

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:17.510
 It costs a little bit to slip because 

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:22.220
 super on the surface that is pretty 

00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:24.770
 porous is just absorbing this 

00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:27.230
 product and will allow it to dry 

00:02:24.770 --> 00:02:30.300
 Quick 

00:02:27.230 --> 00:02:32.940
 super curitiba 

00:02:30.300 --> 00:02:36.330
 I do not need to take the piece to base 

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:38.460
 white note that this is a gray if 

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:40.830
 it was black no problem remember 

00:02:38.460 --> 00:02:42.800
 when I made the fabrics the defeats 

00:02:40.830 --> 00:02:46.190
 precious 

00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:50.460
 there was no need to take the target once 

00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:52.920
 I finish this color I let it dry 

00:02:50.460 --> 00:02:55.320
 and change of tone in this case I'm going to 

00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:58.560
 change brush simply to 

00:02:55.320 --> 00:03:00.510
 speed up work a little 

00:02:58.560 --> 00:03:02.700
 good because so that they do not become contaminated 

00:03:00.510 --> 00:03:06.870
 the settlers and agree faster is more 

00:03:02.700 --> 00:03:10.230
 fast if we have a group of brushes 

00:03:06.870 --> 00:03:12.900
 It will not help me right here 

00:03:10.230 --> 00:03:15.450
 we can work without problems and 

00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:17.549
 changing brush and good color in 

00:03:15.450 --> 00:03:19.709
 the case of the drops was a surface 

00:03:17.549 --> 00:03:23.250
 totally waterproof the state 

00:03:19.709 --> 00:03:25.409
 perfect and this one is quite porous and 

00:03:23.250 --> 00:03:27.510
 also perfectly grip the paint 

00:03:25.409 --> 00:03:30.390
 it grabs perfectly and this once 

00:03:27.510 --> 00:03:33.720
 dry and cured that happens at 72 hours 

00:03:30.390 --> 00:03:35.900
 the ojota I can wash it perfectly and 

00:03:33.720 --> 00:03:38.790
 the painting does not go 

00:03:35.900 --> 00:03:40.920
 remember that one of the proposals is 

00:03:38.790 --> 00:03:44.190
 just that they try this product 

00:03:40.920 --> 00:03:48.480
 and see the properties that provides that 

00:03:44.190 --> 00:03:51.989
 within them is the high strength 

00:03:48.480 --> 00:03:56.489
 colors are super strong and vibrant and 

00:03:51.989 --> 00:03:56.970
 High power to cover tivo and resistance 

00:03:56.489 --> 00:03:59.519
 to the sun 

00:03:56.970 --> 00:04:01.700
 they do not change color they do not change color 

00:03:59.519 --> 00:04:04.670
 this is very important 

00:04:01.700 --> 00:04:10.430
 it is very important unalterable in the subject 

00:04:04.670 --> 00:04:13.180
 of when the sun gives them, let's also say 

00:04:10.430 --> 00:04:16.539
 more notice that this is fast 

00:04:13.180 --> 00:04:18.989
 while you continue with the sacks 

00:04:16.539 --> 00:04:22.330
 that hurt 

00:04:18.989 --> 00:04:25.330
 in a next look for a number that is 

00:04:22.330 --> 00:04:27.550
 the biggest one is very difficult we are going to 

00:04:25.330 --> 00:04:30.250
 remember that they have the white magazine 

00:04:27.550 --> 00:04:34.800
 magazine in the best artistic of 

00:04:30.250 --> 00:04:34.800
 the whole country is they know they have everything 

00:04:35.689 --> 00:04:41.899
 look to see if I find for example 

00:04:38.449 --> 00:04:44.180
 have all the classes explained step 

00:04:41.899 --> 00:04:47.840
 Step 

00:04:44.180 --> 00:04:51.440
 they have examples of how to get to 

00:04:47.840 --> 00:04:53.930
 finished after they have interviews 

00:04:51.440 --> 00:04:56.600
 also if they are very interested but 

00:04:53.930 --> 00:04:58.900
 very interesting and good things have 

00:04:56.600 --> 00:05:01.960
 all surfaces 

00:04:58.900 --> 00:05:05.680
 good a lot of things to learn 

00:05:01.960 --> 00:05:08.440
 to investigate to encourage me so 

00:05:05.680 --> 00:05:09.460
 you know they go to the lord of the bookstore and 

00:05:08.440 --> 00:05:11.740
 if they do not have it, they can ask 

00:05:09.460 --> 00:05:13.840
 really and they are for sale all the 

00:05:11.740 --> 00:05:16.060
 numbers all the numbers are added and 

00:05:13.840 --> 00:05:18.610
 so we all come to find them 

00:05:16.060 --> 00:05:20.740
 good can send a mail me have 

00:05:18.610 --> 00:05:23.320
 fear and they will tell you where they can 

00:05:20.740 --> 00:05:25.419
 get here are all the numbers 

00:05:23.320 --> 00:05:28.389
 that you can find from the first 

00:05:25.419 --> 00:05:30.759
 until the last and in one of these are 

00:05:28.389 --> 00:05:32.009
 your boots are macarena number two 

00:05:30.759 --> 00:05:34.469
 I think 

00:05:32.009 --> 00:05:38.659
 very well so good they approach the 

00:05:34.469 --> 00:05:42.059
 bookstore and the van they ask for them because 

00:05:38.659 --> 00:05:45.809
 they are totally separate triggers 

00:05:42.059 --> 00:05:47.789
 triggers of the idea is of ideas is 

00:05:45.809 --> 00:05:50.969
 a great motivation to get to 

00:05:47.789 --> 00:05:53.699
 work propose and that each one good 

00:05:50.969 --> 00:05:55.319
 hence the emergence of a project we 

00:05:53.699 --> 00:05:57.270
 we throw an idea and everyone can 

00:05:55.319 --> 00:05:58.860
 then unfold it inside the 

00:05:57.270 --> 00:06:02.430
 surface or inside what you want 

00:05:58.860 --> 00:06:04.680
 work well this once it dries if 

00:06:02.430 --> 00:06:06.270
 you see that it is necessary to apply a 

00:06:04.680 --> 00:06:08.699
 second layer, notice that this is from 

00:06:06.270 --> 00:06:10.559
 high to cover I put a single one not 

00:06:08.699 --> 00:06:13.110
 you need a second price you 

00:06:10.559 --> 00:06:15.360
 they're more interested in what they can do 

00:06:13.110 --> 00:06:17.639
 once you drink to two hours or three 

00:06:15.360 --> 00:06:20.370
 that can already repeat a second 

00:06:17.639 --> 00:06:23.419
 application this dark totally to the 

00:06:20.370 --> 00:06:23.419
 72 hours
