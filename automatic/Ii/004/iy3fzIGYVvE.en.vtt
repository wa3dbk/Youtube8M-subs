let's<00:01:21.689> uh<00:01:22.369> let's<00:01:23.369> get<00:01:23.580> right<00:01:23.790> down<00:01:23.909> to<00:01:23.970> the

00:01:24.109 --> 00:01:24.119 
let's uh let's get right down to the

00:01:24.119 --> 00:01:26.990 
let's uh let's get right down to the
articulation<00:01:24.890> okay<00:01:25.890> so<00:01:25.950> since<00:01:26.640> this<00:01:26.790> is<00:01:26.850> a

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:27.000 
articulation okay so since this is a

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:30.200 
articulation okay so since this is a
figma<00:01:27.420> he<00:01:27.869> is<00:01:28.020> very<00:01:28.350> highly<00:01:28.710> articulated<00:01:29.460> so<00:01:30.180> I

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:30.210 
figma he is very highly articulated so I

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:31.490 
figma he is very highly articulated so I

00:03:18.860 --> 00:03:18.870 
joint it basically does the job of a

00:03:18.870 --> 00:03:22.789 
joint it basically does the job of a
double<00:03:19.139> joint<00:03:20.000> but<00:03:21.000> you<00:03:21.120> know<00:03:21.470> it's<00:03:22.470> got<00:03:22.620> this

00:03:25.309 --> 00:03:25.319 
little ball thing here so it kind of

00:03:25.319 --> 00:03:27.170 
little ball thing here so it kind of
ruins<00:03:25.650> the<00:03:25.769> scope<00:03:26.010> a<00:03:26.099> little<00:03:26.310> bit<00:03:26.459> but<00:03:26.760> it's<00:03:27.060> a

00:03:27.170 --> 00:03:27.180 
ruins the scope a little bit but it's a

00:03:27.180 --> 00:03:29.689 
ruins the scope a little bit but it's a
figma<00:03:27.510> I<00:03:27.750> can<00:03:28.169> deal<00:03:28.319> with<00:03:28.349> it<00:03:28.590> and<00:03:28.769> on<00:03:29.459> the<00:03:29.549> feet

00:03:29.689 --> 00:03:29.699 
figma I can deal with it and on the feet

00:03:29.699 --> 00:03:32.899 
figma I can deal with it and on the feet
you<00:03:30.599> can<00:03:30.780> go<00:03:30.930> side<00:03:31.530> to<00:03:31.560> side<00:03:31.859> up<00:03:32.280> and<00:03:32.370> down<00:03:32.489> and
