00:00:01.070 --> 00:00:06.140
 hello today i will show you how 

00:00:03.689 --> 00:00:09.630
 fast and quality stripped pike on yourself 

00:00:06.140 --> 00:00:12.509
 we need a professional transfer 

00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:13.460
 serial fork and pike itself itself is not 

00:00:12.509 --> 00:00:19.400
 cleaned up 

00:00:13.460 --> 00:00:19.400
 I did pre-gut begin 

00:00:55.980 --> 00:01:08.470
 here we get a piece of fillet with ribs and 

00:00:59.500 --> 00:01:10.740
 while with skin and let it separate the fly 

00:01:08.470 --> 00:01:10.740
 ribs 

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:29.550
 we receive a thin film with ribs 

00:01:26.720 --> 00:01:33.300
 let 's do the same thing with the second 

00:01:29.550 --> 00:01:34.560
 a piece of the left spine on 

00:01:33.300 --> 00:01:36.890
 this piece is why there is absolutely 

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:36.890
 a little bit 

00:01:44.940 --> 00:01:48.330
 remove pectoral fins 

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:52.080
 will have to twist 

00:02:08.890 --> 00:02:14.620
 now separate the fillets from the skins 

00:02:27.020 --> 00:02:35.820
 we get a piece of skin clean and pieces 

00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:52.680
 chicken meat do the same with 

00:02:35.820 --> 00:02:53.520
 the second start-up here are 2 such carts pieces 

00:02:52.680 --> 00:03:21.960
 now we are beautiful 

00:02:53.520 --> 00:03:25.220
