00:00:05.660 --> 00:00:09.410
 jong ajax is working on a series of good ones 

00:00:07.640 --> 00:00:10.760
 competitions this weekend it plays 

00:00:09.410 --> 00:00:13.130
 team from fons groenendijk for the 

00:00:10.760 --> 00:00:14.509
 competition at almere city 

00:00:13.130 --> 00:00:16.070
 but until then the eyes will 

00:00:14.509 --> 00:00:18.259
 probably mainly on the 

00:00:16.070 --> 00:00:20.060
 trainer are self-focused in Groenendijk 

00:00:18.259 --> 00:00:21.439
 namely announced on Thursday the 

00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:24.619
 end of the season 

00:00:21.439 --> 00:00:26.210
 as a coach of young ajax and that is one 

00:00:24.619 --> 00:00:28.369
 informed decision by one 

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:32.920
 49 year old trainer 

00:00:28.369 --> 00:00:32.920
 why well that is not so difficult 

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:39.769
 I have now reached the age of yes 

00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:41.420
 that I should not do this too long either 

00:00:39.769 --> 00:00:44.180
 in this position I am of course too 

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:46.129
 four head coaches have already been one 

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:51.229
 yes the situation is not easy again 

00:00:46.129 --> 00:00:54.170
 with young ajax is quite difficult with 

00:00:51.229 --> 00:00:58.489
 so many changes 

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:59.540
 in order that ultimately that good 

00:00:58.489 --> 00:01:02.980
 way 

00:00:59.540 --> 00:01:06.110
 really satisfying to fill in yes then 

00:01:02.980 --> 00:01:08.210
 then I think I will 

00:01:06.110 --> 00:01:11.120
 they pass someone looking for one 

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:12.440
 another on the right 

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:13.640
 composition of his half that this 

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:15.800
 season not only with his 

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:17.750
 own preferences but also with those of the 

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:19.340
 staff of the first of ajax 

00:01:17.750 --> 00:01:21.050
 That meant he rarely met 

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:21.979
 the same eleven in the next match 

00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:23.960
 could start 

00:01:21.979 --> 00:01:25.310
 that was known in advance but set the 

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:26.990
 groenendijk several times for one 

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:28.729
 quite a challenge 

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:30.229
 yes it is tricky if you are natural 

00:01:28.729 --> 00:01:33.259
 something in your head for the weekend and 

00:01:30.229 --> 00:01:34.520
 the goes by four five six names 

00:01:33.259 --> 00:01:37.070
 a cross 

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:39.080
 well that makes it difficult and so yes me 

00:01:37.070 --> 00:01:42.729
 I especially like the two words that I use 

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:45.380
 I have used a lot and improvise 

00:01:42.729 --> 00:01:48.200
 be flexible and those are the things 

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:50.330
 which I particularly need to learn myself 

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:51.950
 yes it was sure it was definitely one 

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:54.619
 interesting year for me 

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:56.570
 and it's all baggage that doesn't mean anything 

00:01:54.619 --> 00:01:57.979
 I want to win every game are 

00:01:56.570 --> 00:01:59.539
 competitions this season have been you 

00:01:57.979 --> 00:02:03.229
 could not beat me 

00:01:59.539 --> 00:02:06.469
 I had trouble with that, she is correct 

00:02:03.229 --> 00:02:08.599
 Her gillis goes and you can almost feel it 

00:02:06.469 --> 00:02:10.009
 not putting together a team from earlier times 

00:02:08.599 --> 00:02:12.319
 going this season 

00:02:10.009 --> 00:02:14.000
 yes then I have difficulty with that 

00:02:12.319 --> 00:02:15.230
 yes then you naturally go for that 

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:18.500
 put yourself in a row 

00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:21.650
 are you going to make decisions do you want this 

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:24.380
 then another year it is 

00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:28.310
 in this same way I have 

00:02:24.380 --> 00:02:30.110
 said ok that don't do it 

00:02:28.310 --> 00:02:31.849
 with young ajax the emphasis is even more 

00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:34.250
 then on the performance especially on the 

00:02:31.849 --> 00:02:35.599
 individual development of players and 

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:37.880
 Groenendijk has this in this area 

00:02:35.599 --> 00:02:41.269
 season definitely seen improvement 

00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:42.950
 mentally we are going to fight grown up 

00:02:41.269 --> 00:02:45.799
 for you want to measure we still play one 

00:02:42.950 --> 00:02:46.940
 we have 5 a juniors in the weekly 

00:02:45.799 --> 00:02:50.150
 base 

00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:52.310
 boys of 17 years who nevertheless who 

00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:53.720
 grow and I think we will certainly take steps 

00:02:52.310 --> 00:02:56.030
 have made see 

00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:58.430
 ricardo recently chosen after that just yet 

00:02:56.030 --> 00:02:59.200
 appearing in the tub with those are things 

00:02:58.430 --> 00:03:01.750
 That 

00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:04.000
 as trainers we all find one 

00:03:01.750 --> 00:03:05.800
 little hit make good dyke remember 

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:07.900
 not where he will be his trainer career 

00:03:05.800 --> 00:03:09.640
 The decision nevertheless dates from 

00:03:07.900 --> 00:03:10.330
 his departure from Ajax for a while 

00:03:09.640 --> 00:03:12.370
 ago 

00:03:10.330 --> 00:03:14.709
 i have a january with wim jonk and 

00:03:12.370 --> 00:03:15.940
 Dennis Bergkamp already talked about that 

00:03:14.709 --> 00:03:18.550
 so that was a while ago 

00:03:15.940 --> 00:03:22.300
 they knew how I thought 

00:03:18.550 --> 00:03:24.160
 The also understand so yes then before 

00:03:22.300 --> 00:03:26.019
 you are about a possible extension 

00:03:24.160 --> 00:03:28.150
 to talk 

00:03:26.019 --> 00:03:31.510
 yes I have indicated that I am anyway 

00:03:28.150 --> 00:03:33.549
 also prefer as head coach 

00:03:31.510 --> 00:03:35.110
 are active and that therefore my 

00:03:33.549 --> 00:03:37.959
 ambitions 

00:03:35.110 --> 00:03:40.390
 so we'll see yes and if it's like that 

00:03:37.959 --> 00:03:44.410
 not comes along then yes that's a shame 

00:03:40.390 --> 00:03:45.910
 but I can't train at every club 

00:03:44.410 --> 00:03:51.190
 you prefer that you have something in you 

00:03:45.910 --> 00:03:54.010
 head no no I never felt a day or 

00:03:51.190 --> 00:03:56.440
 a second busy for the future 

00:03:54.010 --> 00:03:59.920
 And then I don't do it and I know 

00:03:56.440 --> 00:04:01.900
 sure it will be fine again and yes 

00:03:59.920 --> 00:04:02.829
 I am always positive about that 

00:04:01.900 --> 00:04:05.470
 towards the future 

00:04:02.829 --> 00:04:07.209
 so it won't be a problem Saturday 

00:04:05.470 --> 00:04:09.220
 plays boy has out at almere city 

00:04:07.209 --> 00:04:11.019
 groenendijk then hope to build on 

00:04:09.220 --> 00:04:12.400
 the strong series of the past weeks 

00:04:11.019 --> 00:04:15.130
 and really want that line 

00:04:12.400 --> 00:04:17.620
 extend the last time 

00:04:15.130 --> 00:04:20.530
 and that means that we perform well 

00:04:17.620 --> 00:04:21.820
 with the very nice football with good 

00:04:20.530 --> 00:04:24.100
 Set up 

00:04:21.820 --> 00:04:26.380
 I think a place in the left row 

00:04:24.100 --> 00:04:27.880
 still possible 

00:04:26.380 --> 00:04:29.590
 think that there is a nice challenge 

00:04:27.880 --> 00:04:31.510
 but not to lose sight of it 

00:04:29.590 --> 00:04:34.420
 that we also just want good 

00:04:31.510 --> 00:04:36.610
 and we play football that last 

00:04:34.420 --> 00:04:38.890
 also monitored and 

00:04:36.610 --> 00:04:39.580
 development of this nice ending 

00:04:38.890 --> 00:04:43.120
 birthday 

00:04:39.580 --> 00:04:47.760
 yes every match I have come for 

00:04:43.120 --> 00:04:47.760
 on her beautiful pots that come together
