00:01:34.039 --> 00:01:34.049 
obviously enter the jungle temple first

00:01:34.049 --> 00:01:35.929 
obviously enter the jungle temple first
now<00:01:34.380> I<00:01:34.409> think<00:01:34.770> this<00:01:34.860> jungle<00:01:35.159> temples<00:01:35.520> a<00:01:35.670> little

00:01:35.929 --> 00:01:35.939 
now I think this jungle temples a little

00:01:35.939 --> 00:01:37.280 
now I think this jungle temples a little
bit<00:01:36.030> different<00:01:36.360> compared<00:01:36.689> to<00:01:36.750> the<00:01:36.840> normal<00:01:37.170> one

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:37.290 
bit different compared to the normal one

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:39.260 
bit different compared to the normal one
that<00:01:37.439> I've<00:01:37.530> done<00:01:37.770> I<00:01:37.920> think<00:01:37.950> the<00:01:38.670> buttons<00:01:39.060> will

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:39.270 
that I've done I think the buttons will

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:41.450 
that I've done I think the buttons will
be<00:01:39.390> on<00:01:39.509> the<00:01:39.659> right<00:01:40.110> well<00:01:40.500> on<00:01:40.710> the<00:01:41.009> left<00:01:41.220> hand

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:41.460 
be on the right well on the left hand

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:44.179 
be on the right well on the left hand
side<00:01:41.670> as<00:01:41.850> it<00:01:41.970> is<00:01:42.090> so<00:01:43.020> yeah<00:01:43.470> let's<00:01:43.740> quickly

00:01:44.179 --> 00:01:44.189 
side as it is so yeah let's quickly

00:01:44.189 --> 00:01:46.789 
side as it is so yeah let's quickly
flicked<00:01:44.610> them<00:01:44.850> down<00:01:45.090> and<00:01:45.329> I<00:01:46.200> do<00:01:46.259> believe<00:01:46.560> I

00:01:46.789 --> 00:01:46.799 
flicked them down and I do believe I

00:01:46.799 --> 00:01:48.230 
flicked them down and I do believe I
flick<00:01:47.070> them<00:01:47.250> back<00:01:47.460> up<00:01:47.670> and<00:01:47.700> then<00:01:48.000> click<00:01:48.210> that

of did oh well there you go close enough
and<00:01:56.070> and<00:01:56.880> in<00:01:57.210> here<00:01:57.540> is<00:01:57.750> obviously<00:01:57.960> two

00:01:58.700 --> 00:01:58.710 
and and in here is obviously two

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:01.039 
and and in here is obviously two
diamonds<00:01:59.310> and<00:01:59.610> some<00:02:00.299> rotten<00:02:00.509> flesh<00:02:00.689> I<00:02:00.869> think

00:02:01.039 --> 00:02:01.049 
diamonds and some rotten flesh I think

00:02:01.049 --> 00:02:02.450 
diamonds and some rotten flesh I think
you<00:02:01.110> get<00:02:01.229> an<00:02:01.320> achievement<00:02:01.380> for<00:02:01.799> eating<00:02:02.100> rotten

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:02.460 
you get an achievement for eating rotten

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:04.130 
you get an achievement for eating rotten
flesh<00:02:02.670> but<00:02:02.909> I'm<00:02:02.969> not<00:02:03.090> too<00:02:03.270> sure<00:02:03.299> a<00:02:03.659> few<00:02:03.899> bones

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:04.140 
flesh but I'm not too sure a few bones

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:05.600 
flesh but I'm not too sure a few bones
so<00:02:04.380> that's<00:02:04.530> not<00:02:04.799> too<00:02:04.950> bad<00:02:05.100> and<00:02:05.280> obviously<00:02:05.490> you

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:05.610 
so that's not too bad and obviously you

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:07.490 
so that's not too bad and obviously you
can<00:02:05.759> take<00:02:05.969> these<00:02:06.420> sticky<00:02:06.750> pistons<00:02:07.170> because

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:07.500 
can take these sticky pistons because

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:09.400 
can take these sticky pistons because
slimes<00:02:07.829> are<00:02:08.009> quite<00:02:08.190> hard<00:02:08.369> to<00:02:08.489> come<00:02:08.670> by<00:02:08.819> so<00:02:09.119> yeah

00:02:09.400 --> 00:02:09.410 
slimes are quite hard to come by so yeah

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:12.050

00:03:06.600 --> 00:03:08.810 
do believe we are going to get ourselves
the<00:03:07.080> ravine<00:03:07.410> so<00:03:07.709> I<00:03:07.740> keep<00:03:08.040> on<00:03:08.190> putting<00:03:08.459> torches

00:03:08.810 --> 00:03:08.820 
the ravine so I keep on putting torches

00:03:08.820 --> 00:03:10.760 
the ravine so I keep on putting torches
down<00:03:09.000> because<00:03:09.270> I<00:03:09.360> know<00:03:09.390> like<00:03:09.780> it's<00:03:10.590> gonna<00:03:10.680> be

00:03:10.760 --> 00:03:10.770 
down because I know like it's gonna be

00:03:10.770 --> 00:03:13.910 
down because I know like it's gonna be
quite<00:03:10.920> hard<00:03:11.070> to<00:03:11.160> you<00:03:11.220> guys<00:03:11.370> to<00:03:11.520> see<00:03:12.320> so<00:03:13.320> yeah<00:03:13.740> we

00:03:13.910 --> 00:03:13.920 
quite hard to you guys to see so yeah we

00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:15.620 
quite hard to you guys to see so yeah we
should<00:03:14.130> end<00:03:14.370> up<00:03:14.459> hitting<00:03:14.640> a<00:03:14.970> cave<00:03:15.240> and<00:03:15.480> then

00:03:15.620 --> 00:03:15.630 
should end up hitting a cave and then

00:03:15.630 --> 00:03:18.020 
should end up hitting a cave and then
buy<00:03:15.900> that<00:03:16.080> cave<00:03:16.320> there<00:03:16.980> is<00:03:17.220> just<00:03:17.519> the<00:03:17.610> ravine

00:03:18.020 --> 00:03:18.030 
buy that cave there is just the ravine

00:03:18.030 --> 00:03:19.280 
buy that cave there is just the ravine
yeah<00:03:18.150> there<00:03:18.390> you<00:03:18.420> go<00:03:18.480> so<00:03:18.810> we're<00:03:18.930> inside<00:03:19.170> the

00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:20.730 
cave now there's a bit of gold already

00:03:20.730 --> 00:03:23.570 
cave now there's a bit of gold already
up<00:03:21.720> here<00:03:21.780> I'm<00:03:22.350> not<00:03:22.650> too<00:03:22.800> sure<00:03:23.010> what<00:03:23.310> he's

00:03:23.570 --> 00:03:23.580 
up here I'm not too sure what he's

00:03:23.580 --> 00:03:24.979 
up here I'm not too sure what he's
around<00:03:23.790> here<00:03:24.000> I<00:03:24.030> never<00:03:24.120> really<00:03:24.480> looked<00:03:24.600> others

00:03:24.979 --> 00:03:24.989 
around here I never really looked others

00:03:24.989 --> 00:03:26.840 
around here I never really looked others
more<00:03:25.140> focused<00:03:25.470> on<00:03:25.530> the<00:03:25.590> ravine<00:03:25.860> yeah<00:03:26.580> as<00:03:26.700> you

00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:26.850 
more focused on the ravine yeah as you

00:03:26.850 --> 00:03:29.690 
more focused on the ravine yeah as you
can<00:03:26.940> see<00:03:27.090> it's<00:03:27.420> just<00:03:27.510> a<00:03:27.840> bit<00:03:28.140> of<00:03:28.370> extra<00:03:29.370> cave

00:03:29.690 --> 00:03:29.700 
can see it's just a bit of extra cave

00:03:29.700 --> 00:03:31.880 
can see it's just a bit of extra cave
and<00:03:30.030> nothing<00:03:30.330> too<00:03:30.540> fancy<00:03:30.810> but<00:03:31.410> if<00:03:31.530> you<00:03:31.620> go<00:03:31.739> back

and nothing too fancy but if you go back
round<00:03:32.160> here<00:03:32.430> where<00:03:32.670> we<00:03:32.940> just<00:03:33.150> came<00:03:33.330> out<00:03:33.600> it's

00:03:33.949 --> 00:03:33.959 
round here where we just came out it's

00:03:33.959 --> 00:03:37.040 
round here where we just came out it's
gold<00:03:34.170> on<00:03:34.290> the<00:03:34.350> floor<00:03:34.620> bit<00:03:35.370> more<00:03:35.550> gold<00:03:35.820> and<00:03:36.540> up

00:03:37.040 --> 00:03:37.050 
gold on the floor bit more gold and up

00:03:37.050 --> 00:03:38.750 
gold on the floor bit more gold and up
here's<00:03:37.440> obviously<00:03:37.860> lava<00:03:38.040> so<00:03:38.280> you<00:03:38.370> can<00:03:38.519> get

00:03:38.750 --> 00:03:38.760 
here's obviously lava so you can get

00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:40.910 
here's obviously lava so you can get
your<00:03:38.910> lava<00:03:39.060> bucket<00:03:39.540> for<00:03:39.720> smelting<00:03:40.170> stuff<00:03:40.739> with

00:03:40.910 --> 00:03:40.920 
your lava bucket for smelting stuff with

00:03:40.920 --> 00:03:42.890 
your lava bucket for smelting stuff with
a<00:03:40.980> furnace<00:03:41.310> and<00:03:41.519> here<00:03:41.730> we<00:03:41.850> go<00:03:42.000> we<00:03:42.239> are<00:03:42.269> inside

00:03:42.890 --> 00:03:42.900 
a furnace and here we go we are inside

00:03:42.900 --> 00:03:45.380 
a furnace and here we go we are inside
the<00:03:43.230> ravine<00:03:43.799> I<00:03:43.830> think<00:03:44.160> it's<00:03:44.280> a<00:03:44.489> little<00:03:45.150> tiny

00:03:45.380 --> 00:03:45.390 
the ravine I think it's a little tiny

00:03:45.390 --> 00:03:47.120 
the ravine I think it's a little tiny
ravine<00:03:45.690> on<00:03:45.840> some<00:03:46.049> sides<00:03:46.320> well<00:03:46.890> it's<00:03:47.040> a

00:03:47.120 --> 00:03:47.130 
ravine on some sides well it's a

00:03:47.130 --> 00:03:48.740 
ravine on some sides well it's a
multiple<00:03:47.519> split<00:03:47.850> ravine<00:03:48.299> as<00:03:48.480> you<00:03:48.570> can<00:03:48.660> see

00:03:48.740 --> 00:03:48.750 
multiple split ravine as you can see

00:03:48.750 --> 00:03:52.580 
multiple split ravine as you can see
more<00:03:48.930> gold<00:03:49.200> again<00:03:49.730> lapis<00:03:50.730> lazuli<00:03:50.850> and<00:03:51.590> let's

00:03:52.580 --> 00:03:52.590 
more gold again lapis lazuli and let's

00:03:52.590 --> 00:03:55.009 
more gold again lapis lazuli and let's
keep<00:03:52.739> going<00:03:53.070> I<00:03:53.390> don't<00:03:54.390> really<00:03:54.630> know<00:03:54.750> how<00:03:54.959> long

00:03:55.009 --> 00:03:55.019 
keep going I don't really know how long

00:03:55.019 --> 00:03:56.660 
keep going I don't really know how long
this<00:03:55.290> ravine<00:03:55.590> is<00:03:55.769> I<00:03:55.830> didn't<00:03:56.220> fully<00:03:56.340> have<00:03:56.640> a

00:03:56.660 --> 00:03:56.670 
this ravine is I didn't fully have a

00:03:56.670 --> 00:03:58.880 
this ravine is I didn't fully have a
look<00:03:56.880> so<00:03:57.390> that's<00:03:57.690> just<00:03:57.870> a<00:03:58.049> little<00:03:58.200> side<00:03:58.530> ravine

00:03:58.880 --> 00:03:58.890 
look so that's just a little side ravine

00:03:58.890 --> 00:04:00.979 
look so that's just a little side ravine
they've<00:03:59.070> got<00:03:59.280> going<00:03:59.549> on<00:03:59.760> there<00:04:00.060> if<00:04:00.540> I<00:04:00.660> go<00:04:00.810> back

00:04:00.979 --> 00:04:00.989 
they've got going on there if I go back

00:04:00.989 --> 00:04:03.229 
they've got going on there if I go back
round<00:04:01.290> here<00:04:01.530> there<00:04:01.739> should<00:04:01.769> be<00:04:02.130> a<00:04:02.370> another

00:04:03.229 --> 00:04:03.239 
round here there should be a another

00:04:03.239 --> 00:04:05.750 
round here there should be a another
bigger<00:04:03.540> ravine<00:04:04.110> there<00:04:04.410> we<00:04:04.500> go<00:04:04.650> so<00:04:05.130> the<00:04:05.610> main

00:04:05.750 --> 00:04:05.760 
bigger ravine there we go so the main

00:04:05.760 --> 00:04:07.400 
bigger ravine there we go so the main
feature<00:04:06.030> around<00:04:06.239> here<00:04:06.510> is<00:04:06.630> in<00:04:06.780> multiple<00:04:06.959> cave

00:04:07.400 --> 00:04:07.410 
feature around here is in multiple cave

00:04:07.410 --> 00:04:09.740 
feature around here is in multiple cave
systems<00:04:07.890> nearby<00:04:08.310> and<00:04:08.580> obviously<00:04:09.420> there<00:04:09.630> is<00:04:09.720> a

00:04:09.740 --> 00:04:09.750 
systems nearby and obviously there is a

00:04:09.750 --> 00:04:11.060 
systems nearby and obviously there is a
decent<00:04:10.320> amount<00:04:10.440> of<00:04:10.650> ores

00:04:11.060 --> 00:04:11.070 
decent amount of ores

00:04:11.070 --> 00:04:13.580 
decent amount of ores
around<00:04:12.030> obviously<00:04:12.630> there's<00:04:12.989> a<00:04:13.049> lot<00:04:13.320> of<00:04:13.380> lava

00:04:13.580 --> 00:04:13.590 
around obviously there's a lot of lava

00:04:13.590 --> 00:04:15.080 
around obviously there's a lot of lava
so<00:04:13.769> you<00:04:13.860> can<00:04:13.980> use<00:04:14.130> a<00:04:14.160> larva<00:04:14.459> to<00:04:14.580> advantage<00:04:14.970> as

00:04:15.080 --> 00:04:15.090 
so you can use a larva to advantage as

00:04:15.090 --> 00:04:17.599 
so you can use a larva to advantage as
well<00:04:15.269> as<00:04:15.390> water<00:04:15.709> unskilled<00:04:16.709> look<00:04:16.890> bonus<00:04:17.340> caves

00:04:17.599 --> 00:04:17.609 
well as water unskilled look bonus caves

00:04:17.609 --> 00:04:21.380 
well as water unskilled look bonus caves
but<00:04:18.450> I<00:04:18.510> continue<00:04:19.140> to<00:04:19.290> go<00:04:19.410> through<00:04:20.390> there's

00:04:21.380 --> 00:04:21.390 
but I continue to go through there's

00:04:21.390 --> 00:04:23.390 
but I continue to go through there's
more<00:04:21.780> love<00:04:21.989> over<00:04:22.320> there<00:04:22.470> I<00:04:22.530> do<00:04:22.710> believe<00:04:23.070> yep

00:04:25.760 --> 00:04:25.770 
but there's a massive lava pit so it's a

00:04:25.770 --> 00:04:27.470 
but there's a massive lava pit so it's a
pretty<00:04:26.310> big<00:04:26.460> cave<00:04:26.700> for<00:04:26.910> you<00:04:27.000> guys<00:04:27.180> too

but<00:04:35.580> ya<00:04:35.900> fro<00:04:36.900> here<00:04:37.110> there's<00:04:37.260> another<00:04:37.350> little

but ya fro here there's another little
water<00:04:37.950> bit<00:04:38.250> so<00:04:38.400> this<00:04:38.940> cave<00:04:39.240> is<00:04:39.420> probably

00:04:39.650 --> 00:04:39.660 
water bit so this cave is probably

00:04:39.660 --> 00:04:41.690 
water bit so this cave is probably
featuring<00:04:40.170> more<00:04:40.380> ravines<00:04:40.770> hidden<00:04:41.160> around<00:04:41.490> as

you<00:04:42.270> can<00:04:42.420> see<00:04:42.600> this<00:04:42.810> is<00:04:43.110> just<00:04:43.170> a<00:04:43.650> pretty<00:04:44.040> big

00:04:44.390 --> 00:04:44.400 
you can see this is just a pretty big

00:04:44.400 --> 00:04:46.970 
you can see this is just a pretty big
ravine<00:04:44.760> not<00:04:45.570> massive<00:04:46.350> but<00:04:46.380> as<00:04:46.680> you<00:04:46.830> can<00:04:46.920> see

00:04:46.970 --> 00:04:46.980 
ravine not massive but as you can see

00:04:46.980 --> 00:04:48.920 
ravine not massive but as you can see
there's<00:04:47.580> a<00:04:47.670> lot<00:04:48.000> of<00:04:48.090> others<00:04:48.330> around<00:04:48.540> as<00:04:48.780> well
