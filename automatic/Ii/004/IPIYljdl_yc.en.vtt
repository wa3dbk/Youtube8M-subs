 15 years 

00:00:03.810 --> 00:00:06.810
 on the stage we have students and Russian speakers 

00:00:07.390 --> 00:00:10.540
 and from families who want children 

00:00:10.540 --> 00:00:12.120
 preserved the Russian language could not 

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:13.499
 enjoy 

00:00:13.499 --> 00:00:16.119
 treasures of Russian culture 

00:00:16.119 --> 00:00:17.810
 only when th 

00:00:17.810 --> 00:00:20.369
 in this school I know my native language better 

00:00:20.369 --> 00:00:22.179
 parents 1 st 

00:00:22.179 --> 00:00:23.019

00:00:23.019 --> 00:00:25.289
 I want to apologize 

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:27.800
 speak Russian 

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:29.650
 but we do not belong to the study of Russian 

00:00:29.650 --> 00:00:31.010
 language formally 

00:00:31.010 --> 00:00:33.700
 we want our children to love and appreciate 

00:00:33.700 --> 00:00:35.860
 amazing wealth of russian 

00:00:35.860 --> 00:00:38.340
 language and culture 

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:41.000

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:42.760
 lot 

00:00:42.760 --> 00:00:45.760
 whole 

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:47.920
 city 

00:00:47.920 --> 00:00:49.500

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:52.500

 All last year we did not receive 

00:00:56.749 --> 00:00:58.300
 Pushkin 

00:00:58.300 --> 00:01:01.770

 said they make presents then I will give 

00:01:13.189 --> 00:01:16.189
 There is a shade of course more 

00:01:18.580 --> 00:01:20.670
 significant attention 

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:22.620
 third time 

00:01:22.620 --> 00:01:24.080
 and I 

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:25.960
 informs 

00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:28.000
 all this is necessary 

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:30.130
 I hope that she 

00:01:30.130 --> 00:01:32.210
 ten years we have not seen 

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:35.210

00:01:36.790 --> 00:01:39.470
 jur 

00:01:39.470 --> 00:01:40.760
 like this 

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:43.070

 I came here two years ago and 

00:01:52.750 --> 00:01:54.280
 of course reading 

00:01:54.280 --> 00:01:57.119
 not bypassed I don't know her american school 

00:01:57.119 --> 00:01:59.760
 Belarusian school I'm sure that I have 

00:01:59.760 --> 00:02:01.650
 there is much more opportunity to achieve 

00:02:01.650 --> 00:02:04.520
 all i want is russian championship 

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:07.520

00:02:25.159 --> 00:02:27.769

00:02:27.769 --> 00:02:30.469
 i know what i will do in this part i 

00:02:30.469 --> 00:02:33.719
 was signed 

00:02:33.719 --> 00:02:34.909
 Further

00:02:37.459 --> 00:02:40.459
 Thais Rosspirtprom 

00:02:41.059 --> 00:02:42.359
 although 

00:02:42.359 --> 00:02:44.629
 there were many children through managed 

00:02:44.629 --> 00:02:46.649
 much higher level of education 

00:02:46.649 --> 00:02:49.189
 I made many friends and generally here 

00:02:49.189 --> 00:02:50.849
 interesting political forces 

00:02:50.849 --> 00:02:51.929
 interests 

00:02:51.929 --> 00:02:54.189
 alone 

00:02:54.189 --> 00:02:56.649
 correspondent percentage 

00:02:56.649 --> 00:02:58.939
 that's all man 

00:02:58.939 --> 00:03:00.939
 hill here if 

00:03:00.939 --> 00:03:04.109
 with this bankruptcy procedure for this 

00:03:04.109 --> 00:03:07.109
 need to live hard to read in Russian 

00:03:08.929 --> 00:03:11.659
 in politics is not some kind of Russian word though 

00:03:11.659 --> 00:03:13.559
 still very important to teach them good 

00:03:13.559 --> 00:03:15.899
 English or see one of the personal 

00:03:15.899 --> 00:03:17.699
 hygiene year 

00:03:17.699 --> 00:03:19.529
 which nation is ordinary 

00:03:19.529 --> 00:03:21.089
 american shishkova 

00:03:21.089 --> 00:03:24.039
 but with an accelerated model learning 

00:03:24.039 --> 00:03:26.019
 our children after the eighth grade 

00:03:26.019 --> 00:03:29.499
 Do you get the best American higher 

00:03:29.499 --> 00:03:30.779
 schools 

00:03:30.779 --> 00:03:32.979
 and by the age of eighteen gets 

00:03:32.979 --> 00:03:35.309
 bachelor degree 

00:03:35.309 --> 00:03:37.139
 shakes a row I finished luxury 

00:03:37.139 --> 00:03:39.590
 Chamber UAH up to 18 and graduated 

00:03:39.590 --> 00:03:41.769
 in Europe fear in the field 

00:03:41.769 --> 00:03:43.999
 of course one year left will close everything you have 

00:03:43.999 --> 00:03:47.269
 was the easiest one of the most item 

00:03:47.269 --> 00:03:49.809
 the latter covers this 25 

00:03:49.809 --> 00:03:52.809
 enterprise shares 

00:03:53.449 --> 00:03:55.909
 I'm 13 half years over 

00:03:55.909 --> 00:03:57.359
 this is high school 

00:03:57.359 --> 00:04:00.959
 now the coin is clear as i reported 

00:04:00.959 --> 00:04:04.129
 we just need to give practice to repair 

00:04:04.129 --> 00:04:05.320
 we want very much 

00:04:05.320 --> 00:04:08.380
 so that the language of Pushkin and Fat stayed with 

00:04:08.380 --> 00:04:10.260
 our children for life
