 South American of more lots bought in

 the moon is a crawling problem 

00:01:03.659 --> 00:01:07.770
 from very young because this when I go to 

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:09.450

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:15.560
 study did not go well the thing that is 

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:17.280
 the biggest one is on the moon here it swells you 

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:19.890
 So what's up 

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:21.840
 the resentful remained angry about that and

 silver I'll buy on the moon 

00:01:29.750 --> 00:01:36.650
 it's clear as an emotional residue of 

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:39.860
 our childhood and adolescence that 

00:01:36.650 --> 00:01:42.260
 have crushed us so much with that 

00:01:39.860 --> 00:01:47.210
 until today comes to live arrives 

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:50.330
 I live and one even gives the possibility of 

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:53.800
 specify it no more than 2,000 Argentines 

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:53.800
 they bought a lot on the moon 

00:01:54.370 --> 00:02:00.460
 in Youtube 

00:01:56.710 --> 00:02:02.080
 a large one in a house that stagnated 

00:02:00.460 --> 00:02:05.560
 have to realize 

00:02:02.080 --> 00:02:07.180

 -clear tankan entendés 

00:02:11.709 --> 00:02:15.190
 and I've also read a lot about 

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:17.170
 internet that on the shores of the ocean 

00:02:15.190 --> 00:02:18.850
 have found many cadets 

00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:20.890
 because that's what happens 

00:02:18.850 --> 00:02:22.989
 you buy you talk to the office of 

00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:24.790
 there is 100 I do not know how many 

00:02:22.989 --> 00:02:26.620
 Speak numbers send you in the cadet 

00:02:24.790 --> 00:02:28.209
 when it enters the atmosphere with the 

00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:30.459
 writing in the fridge box that 

00:02:28.209 --> 00:02:31.989
 has a refrigerator that is saved but the 

00:02:30.459 --> 00:02:34.269
 Cadet catches fire by friction 

00:02:31.989 --> 00:02:35.890
 poplars like apollo 13 and the zanella falls 

00:02:34.269 --> 00:02:38.230
 to the water and the kids well afterwards with the 

00:02:35.890 --> 00:02:40.870
 same tide brings them to the leads to the 

00:02:38.230 --> 00:02:43.209
 Clear clear coast can carry from two 

00:02:40.870 --> 00:02:45.220
 pizzas up to a kilo of ice cream at the same 

00:02:43.209 --> 00:02:46.930
 time brings us to bring brings in this 

00:02:45.220 --> 00:02:48.190
 case for the writer go many are 

00:02:46.930 --> 00:02:51.130

00:02:48.190 --> 00:02:52.510
 order and send them but once in the 

00:02:51.130 --> 00:02:53.980
 nobody specific also in the 

00:02:52.510 --> 00:02:55.450
 conditions that will deliver that 

00:02:53.980 --> 00:03:00.489
 ground 

00:02:55.450 --> 00:03:02.780

 sewer lighting crater and if you get a 

00:03:06.319 --> 00:03:19.580
 crater of a crater and after a 

00:03:15.770 --> 00:03:22.460
