you can get whatever now we have 100

00:01:57.259 --> 00:02:03.499 
you can get whatever now we have 100
each<00:01:58.259> units<00:01:59.869> we're<00:02:00.869> going<00:02:01.170> to<00:02:01.409> put<00:02:01.880> our<00:02:02.880> blast

00:02:03.499 --> 00:02:03.509 
each units we're going to put our blast

00:02:03.509 --> 00:02:07.609 
each units we're going to put our blast
furnace<00:02:03.990> just<00:02:04.890> like<00:02:05.159> this<00:02:06.350> otherwise<00:02:07.350> it

00:02:07.609 --> 00:02:07.619 
furnace just like this otherwise it

00:02:07.619 --> 00:02:12.080 
furnace just like this otherwise it
won't<00:02:07.829> work<00:02:08.479> so<00:02:10.250> you're<00:02:11.250> going<00:02:11.519> to<00:02:11.549> have<00:02:11.850> to

these or in Dutch or initiative because
that's<00:02:25.200> all<00:02:25.650> the<00:02:26.069> heat<00:02:26.370> transfers<00:02:28.250> you<00:02:29.250> know

00:02:29.449 --> 00:02:29.459 
that's all the heat transfers you know

00:02:29.459 --> 00:02:34.190 
that's all the heat transfers you know
how<00:02:31.220> you're<00:02:32.220> going<00:02:32.489> to<00:02:32.819> graph<00:02:33.630> your

how you're going to graph your
compressed<00:02:34.739> air<00:02:34.920> cells<00:02:36.530> and<00:02:37.940> your<00:02:38.940> blast

00:02:39.650 --> 00:02:39.660 
compressed air cells and your blast

00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:43.729 
compressed air cells and your blast
furnace<00:02:40.140> will<00:02:40.380> kneel<00:02:41.269> six<00:02:42.269> ourselves<00:02:42.930> for<00:02:43.530> one

00:02:43.729 --> 00:02:43.739 
furnace will kneel six ourselves for one

00:02:43.739 --> 00:02:50.470 
furnace will kneel six ourselves for one
