00:00:12.410 --> 00:00:17.460
 hello I am pedro benvindo another 

00:00:14.969 --> 00:00:20.400
 tutorial in this video lesson today I'm going 

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:23.130
 teach you how to free the memory of 

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:25.829
 your smartphone or tablet to your 

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:29.099
 SD card 

00:00:25.829 --> 00:00:32.669
 let's use a system manager 

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:36.360
 android application the application comes 50 

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:39.090
 pretty face is homogeneous 

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:44.160
 then to the system already 

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:47.519
 load the application only you connect the 

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:53.730
 device to your computer is either 

00:00:47.519 --> 00:01:10.080
 notebook smartphone through usb cable 

00:00:53.730 --> 00:01:49.049
 here on my notebook will load the 

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:52.469
 smartphone iphone so it does here in the 

00:01:49.049 --> 00:01:57.450
 scan your smartphone screen 

00:01:52.469 --> 00:02:00.780
 or tablet already on the smartphone screen 

00:01:57.450 --> 00:02:03.689
 now draws the 

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:05.909
 percentage of battery charging and 

00:02:03.689 --> 00:02:09.560
 brings the supercade option I want 

00:02:05.909 --> 00:02:09.560
 click here to speed up but still 

00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:20.020
 has a vantage point but the focus is 

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:24.340
 this notes that there is internal memory 

00:02:20.020 --> 00:02:27.340
 of my 3 thousand smartphone that is very 

00:02:24.340 --> 00:02:30.250
 small 16 2.3 mega and who is small 

00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:32.260
 even though it has smaller ones 

00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:37.180
 but this one is very much my memory of him 

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:40.960
 very little below the card that is 

00:02:37.180 --> 00:02:44.530
 connected him the memory card that 

00:02:40.960 --> 00:02:47.080
 People call card sd card is 8 

00:02:44.530 --> 00:02:50.940
 giga it provides some for the 

00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:59.860
 system and that this part here is the 

00:02:50.940 --> 00:03:02.140
 book here then we'll carry 

00:02:59.860 --> 00:03:05.650
 all the projects that I have in my 

00:03:02.140 --> 00:03:08.050
 whether it is in the internal memory or 

00:03:05.650 --> 00:03:09.850
 be on the card 

00:03:08.050 --> 00:03:13.590
 everything that is installed here it goes 

00:03:09.850 --> 00:03:29.890
 submit so far I'll wait 

00:03:13.590 --> 00:03:32.640
 loaded on install systems are 

00:03:29.890 --> 00:03:38.940
 those that cause the device 

00:03:32.640 --> 00:03:41.410
 works in functions and made it for you 

00:03:38.940 --> 00:03:43.660
 interacting with the appliance 

00:03:41.410 --> 00:03:47.620
 for example that google is a browser 

00:03:43.660 --> 00:03:48.280
 nÃ© facebook and other skype and other more 

00:03:47.620 --> 00:03:50.290
 Right? 

00:03:48.280 --> 00:03:53.440
 are appliances that you are pleased to 

00:03:50.290 --> 00:03:55.350
 some young people on your device in other 

00:03:53.440 --> 00:03:59.050
 States 

00:03:55.350 --> 00:04:05.010
 the security it no longer brings forth to 

00:03:59.050 --> 00:04:05.010
 not run the risk of the functionality 

00:04:13.230 --> 00:04:27.750
 that installed in memory 

00:04:23.650 --> 00:04:27.750
 it's not just on my card 

00:04:31.370 --> 00:04:36.080
 the same and only here that is in the 

00:04:33.740 --> 00:04:40.250
 internal memory of my smartphone 

00:04:36.080 --> 00:04:46.610
 if I want to transfer to my 

00:04:40.250 --> 00:04:51.020
 memory card as an example I'll stay 

00:04:46.610 --> 00:05:00.290
 here promoted the size of it is 4 52 

00:04:51.020 --> 00:05:15.199
 We are going to see the autarchy here and have 6 

00:05:00.290 --> 00:05:18.740
 91 Then the memory was on my card 

00:05:15.199 --> 00:05:28.639
 never again on the right handset so you 

00:05:18.740 --> 00:05:30.710
 you will see that your memory has increased in your 

00:05:28.639 --> 00:05:34.419
 internal memory betray why this 

00:05:30.710 --> 00:05:36.740
 to avoid that neighbor message of 

00:05:34.419 --> 00:05:38.570
 storage space and then you do not 

00:05:36.740 --> 00:05:44.330
 You can do anything 

00:05:38.570 --> 00:05:47.210
 the device some will start to lock the 

00:05:44.330 --> 00:05:52.370
 Then the message is passed. 

00:05:47.210 --> 00:05:55.450
 In the future I'll show you how 

00:05:52.370 --> 00:05:55.450
 once and for all 

00:06:00.160 --> 00:06:06.229
 so I 'll show you how 

00:06:03.470 --> 00:06:09.410
 transfer picks up this part of the 

00:06:06.229 --> 00:06:12.380
 your memory card will one half 

00:06:09.410 --> 00:06:15.349
 more or less and play here 

00:06:12.380 --> 00:06:20.000
 you will increase a lot in 1862 in my 

00:06:15.349 --> 00:06:21.080
 here goes to what there 23 gigs some 

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:23.120
 gray thing 

00:06:21.080 --> 00:06:25.729
 so I'm the one who determines what I want 

00:06:23.120 --> 00:06:30.260
 have here on the card here so they are 

00:06:25.729 --> 00:06:32.180
 procedures to be done right and I will 

00:06:30.260 --> 00:06:34.520
 explain step by step and in the 

00:06:32.180 --> 00:06:38.240
 tutorials so I hope I have helped 

00:06:34.520 --> 00:06:40.610
 initially in five months detail the 

00:06:38.240 --> 00:06:43.270
 procedure staying here until the 

00:06:40.610 --> 00:06:43.270
 next to the capital
