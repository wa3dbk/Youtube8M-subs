00:03:44.879 --> 00:03:47.119 
enjoyed the approach the game took to
telling<00:03:45.180> the<00:03:45.269> story<00:03:45.569> although<00:03:46.379> some<00:03:46.980> people

00:03:47.119 --> 00:03:47.129 
telling the story although some people

00:03:47.129 --> 00:03:49.069 
telling the story although some people
may<00:03:47.400> find<00:03:47.669> a<00:03:47.790> narrator<00:03:48.209> to<00:03:48.450> be<00:03:48.599> really

00:03:49.069 --> 00:03:49.079 
may find a narrator to be really

00:03:49.079 --> 00:03:51.080 
may find a narrator to be really
annoying<00:03:49.349> as<00:03:49.769> he<00:03:50.099> will<00:03:50.340> repeat<00:03:50.700> the<00:03:50.849> same

00:03:51.080 --> 00:03:51.090 
annoying as he will repeat the same

00:03:51.090 --> 00:03:53.089 
annoying as he will repeat the same
lines<00:03:51.389> until<00:03:51.810> we<00:03:51.930> advance<00:03:52.230> the<00:03:52.469> story<00:03:52.530> you

00:03:53.089 --> 00:03:53.099 
lines until we advance the story you

00:03:53.099 --> 00:03:55.220 
lines until we advance the story you
find<00:03:53.459> the<00:03:53.760> message<00:03:54.150> he<00:03:54.389> penned<00:03:54.659> on<00:03:54.900> the<00:03:55.019> desk

00:03:55.220 --> 00:03:55.230 
find the message he penned on the desk

00:03:55.230 --> 00:03:57.500 
find the message he penned on the desk
