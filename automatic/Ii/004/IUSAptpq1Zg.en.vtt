 here I have all the craft is not very 

00:02:42.370 --> 00:02:53.590
 is not very big so it's really 

00:02:47.420 --> 00:02:56.720
 I think that already we have invested 0 kama 

00:02:53.590 --> 00:02:58.790
 I go to the tailors workshop I 

00:02:56.720 --> 00:03:03.160
 I'm also level 65 

00:02:58.790 --> 00:03:03.160
 I think I can 

00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:21.170
 I had everything I had friends 

00:03:14.330 --> 00:03:25.160
 because for the tutorial so ears here 

00:03:21.170 --> 00:03:28.370
 would have doha bits just that's it 

00:03:25.160 --> 00:03:30.730
 ears of the web it merge and that's it 

00:03:28.370 --> 00:03:34.430
 we have the ears of the web it 

00:03:30.730 --> 00:03:34.900
 so as you see the gene is not 

00:03:34.430 --> 00:03:38.230
 top 

00:03:34.900 --> 00:03:41.720
 so we're going to go easy 

00:03:38.230 --> 00:03:44.680
 you take runes so went through the 

00:03:41.720 --> 00:03:47.840
 passage runes think I have on me 

00:03:44.680 --> 00:03:49.850
 that 's what we go for that we go directly 

00:03:47.840 --> 00:03:54.069
 see 

00:03:49.850 --> 00:03:54.069
 no I do not have but I have it in the bank 

00:03:56.790 --> 00:04:07.900
 so we go fm the ears to 40 wisdom 

00:04:04.860 --> 00:04:11.500
 so if you're not just pictures 

00:04:07.900 --> 00:04:14.410
 which will make savary 10 to 15000 kama 

00:04:11.500 --> 00:04:17.169
 to have almost for free for 

00:04:14.410 --> 00:04:19.600
 would there be seen there too you see 

00:04:17.169 --> 00:04:20.950
 that a lot of people take the 

00:04:19.600 --> 00:04:24.100
 ears of the web it so it's going 

00:04:20.950 --> 00:04:27.090
 directly from that it's me who you 

00:04:24.100 --> 00:04:27.090
 so say it 

00:04:27.150 --> 00:04:34.260
 damn I dad that I can his balls 

00:04:35.490 --> 00:04:42.639
 sorry so we'll see how much it costs 

00:04:40.540 --> 00:04:45.060
 almost not that's not very 

00:04:42.639 --> 00:04:45.060
 very expensive 

00:04:50.980 --> 00:04:56.480
 so leave to ask a tax collector like 

00:04:54.440 --> 00:04:59.389
 I wanted to say to the first map of 

00:04:56.480 --> 00:05:01.790
 lille where lives then bah you harvest 

00:04:59.389 --> 00:05:05.840
 your tax collector well after or downright 

00:05:01.790 --> 00:05:08.300
 you recruit for europe and 

00:05:05.840 --> 00:05:10.580
 resources needed so that's 8000 

00:05:08.300 --> 00:05:12.880
 kamal and without with 100 normally I 

00:05:10.580 --> 00:05:12.880
 enough 

00:05:20.129 --> 00:05:26.999
 we're going here we go fm it's very 

00:05:23.789 --> 00:05:30.259
 simple just pass pass them 

00:05:26.999 --> 00:05:38.580
 other stages of the ears we do not care 

00:05:30.259 --> 00:05:41.959
 we really do not care so that's it 

00:05:38.580 --> 00:05:49.069
 pretty boring because I'm stumbling on 39 

00:05:41.959 --> 00:05:49.069
 and I want 40 more than one 

00:05:49.580 --> 00:06:00.899
 Come on, let's put a rune of 

00:05:53.429 --> 00:06:03.040
 signature by the cocos last one to the 

00:06:00.899 --> 00:06:06.040
 place 

00:06:03.040 --> 00:06:10.570
 that's forty so you have you'll have 

00:06:06.040 --> 00:06:13.120
 from the web it to 40 wisdom then you go 

00:06:10.570 --> 00:06:19.330
 simply resell them on hdv 

00:06:13.120 --> 00:06:25.210
 tailors I'm going to put it at 399 milk 

00:06:19.330 --> 00:06:26.620
 hama and that's it so I have four hundred 

00:06:25.210 --> 00:06:30.340
 a thousand camatte in my pocket 

00:06:26.620 --> 00:06:31.150
 in five minutes I bought no 

00:06:30.340 --> 00:06:34.930
 resource 

00:06:31.150 --> 00:06:38.200
 so even by posing a tax collector and ben 

00:06:34.930 --> 00:06:38.800
 it's really pure profit and 

00:06:38.200 --> 00:06:43.000
 simple 

00:06:38.800 --> 00:06:45.910
 my 400 kama miles and we'll put them 

00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:50.400
 to 380 thousand 

00:06:45.910 --> 00:06:50.400
 if you want his share directly 

00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:57.760
 380000 so here's the tutorial ends here 

00:06:55.270 --> 00:07:01.270
 I hope this technique 

00:06:57.760 --> 00:07:03.520
 will work for you I invite you to
