00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:34.300 
hope that I'll play a better target and

00:02:34.300 --> 00:02:37.420 
hope that I'll play a better target and
then<00:02:35.300> he<00:02:35.840> can<00:02:36.050> big<00:02:36.290> blast<00:02:36.470> bad<00:02:36.680> so<00:02:36.860> it's<00:02:37.070> one

00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:37.430 
then he can big blast bad so it's one

00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:39.850 
then he can big blast bad so it's one
free<00:02:37.610> damage<00:02:38.020> but<00:02:39.020> it<00:02:39.350> doesn't<00:02:39.590> really<00:02:39.710> matter

00:02:39.850 --> 00:02:39.860 
free damage but it doesn't really matter

00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:42.100 
free damage but it doesn't really matter
the<00:02:40.100> big<00:02:40.310> the<00:02:40.760> important<00:02:41.420> part<00:02:41.600> of<00:02:41.660> this<00:02:41.810> turn

00:02:42.100 --> 00:02:42.110 
the big the important part of this turn

00:02:42.110 --> 00:02:43.810 
the big the important part of this turn
is<00:02:42.320> that<00:02:42.620> I<00:02:42.650> played<00:02:42.890> firewalker<00:02:43.310> instead<00:02:43.730> of

colonnade<00:03:09.230> there<00:03:09.410> is<00:03:09.530> fine<00:03:12.640> so<00:03:13.640> he<00:03:13.820> he<00:03:14.150> doesn't

00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:14.270 
colonnade there is fine so he he doesn't

00:03:14.270 --> 00:03:16.030

00:03:32.770 --> 00:03:32.780 
that he obviously Drury would cast at

00:03:32.780 --> 00:03:37.690 
that he obviously Drury would cast at
Western<00:03:34.300> he<00:03:35.300> doesn't<00:03:35.660> block<00:03:36.100> which<00:03:37.100> why<00:03:37.520> would

00:03:37.690 --> 00:03:37.700 
Western he doesn't block which why would

00:03:37.700 --> 00:03:40.780 
Western he doesn't block which why would
he<00:03:37.760> cast<00:03:38.090> it<00:03:38.300> if<00:03:38.480> he's<00:03:38.720> not<00:03:39.080> gonna<00:03:39.350> block<00:03:39.790> with

he cast it if he's not gonna block with

00:03:40.790 --> 00:03:44.770 
he cast it if he's not gonna block with
it<00:03:40.970> and<00:03:41.350> the<00:03:42.350> answer<00:03:42.590> is<00:03:42.620> serkan<00:03:43.100> which<00:03:43.970> is

00:03:44.770 --> 00:03:44.780 
it and the answer is serkan which is

00:03:44.780 --> 00:03:47.040 
it and the answer is serkan which is
actually<00:03:44.959> not<00:03:45.200> much<00:03:45.380> we<00:03:45.650> can<00:03:45.680> do<00:03:45.890> about<00:03:45.980> but

00:03:47.040 --> 00:03:47.050 
actually not much we can do about but

00:03:47.050 --> 00:03:49.330 
actually not much we can do about but
you<00:03:48.050> know<00:03:48.170> if<00:03:48.290> you<00:03:48.350> if<00:03:48.470> you<00:03:48.739> pay<00:03:48.890> attention<00:03:49.010> you

you know if you if you pay attention you

00:03:49.340 --> 00:03:52.600 
you know if you if you pay attention you
can<00:03:49.489> kind<00:03:49.730> of<00:03:49.790> tell<00:03:49.970> what's<00:03:50.150> coming<00:03:50.480> I<00:03:51.610> just

make another guy with Elspeth instead of

00:03:54.080 --> 00:03:57.750 
make another guy with Elspeth instead of
jumping<00:03:54.260> one<00:03:54.500> of<00:03:54.590> these<00:03:54.709> things<00:03:54.920> because<00:03:55.220> if

00:03:57.750 --> 00:03:57.760 

00:03:57.760 --> 00:04:01.630 

he's<00:03:58.760> going<00:03:59.000> to<00:03:59.060> pulse<00:04:00.100> then<00:04:01.100> he's<00:04:01.489> going<00:04:01.580> to

00:04:01.630 --> 00:04:01.640 
he's going to pulse then he's going to

mean<00:04:27.740> pretty<00:04:28.160> obvious<00:04:29.680> but<00:04:30.680> we<00:04:30.770> can<00:04:32.650> there<00:04:33.650> are

00:04:33.700 --> 00:04:33.710 
mean pretty obvious but we can there are

00:04:33.710 --> 00:04:35.469 
mean pretty obvious but we can there are
a<00:04:33.740> few<00:04:33.889> ways<00:04:34.009> to<00:04:34.070> handle<00:04:34.370> this<00:04:34.610> like<00:04:35.090> we<00:04:35.270> can

00:04:35.469 --> 00:04:35.479 
a few ways to handle this like we can

00:04:35.479 --> 00:04:37.240 
a few ways to handle this like we can
activate<00:04:35.930> the<00:04:36.050> colonnade<00:04:36.440> and<00:04:36.470> make<00:04:36.889> sure<00:04:36.919> the

00:04:37.240 --> 00:04:37.250 
activate the colonnade and make sure the

00:04:37.250 --> 00:04:45.580 
activate the colonnade and make sure the
serkan<00:04:37.669> dies<00:04:37.960> or<00:04:39.039> i<00:04:40.570> can<00:04:41.570> pump<00:04:42.199> and<00:04:44.590> attack

00:04:45.580 --> 00:04:45.590 
serkan dies or i can pump and attack

00:04:45.590 --> 00:04:47.920 
serkan dies or i can pump and attack
then<00:04:46.130> ether<00:04:46.370> serkan<00:04:46.789> or<00:04:47.000> the<00:04:47.090> dragon<00:04:47.300> dies<00:04:47.599> and

00:04:47.920 --> 00:04:47.930 
then ether serkan or the dragon dies and

00:04:47.930 --> 00:04:51.430 
then ether serkan or the dragon dies and
he<00:04:48.800> lets<00:04:49.039> the<00:04:49.160> second<00:04:49.520> i<00:04:49.610> then<00:04:49.910> i<00:04:50.210> can<00:04:50.960> jump<00:04:51.320> up

00:04:51.430 --> 00:04:51.440 
he lets the second i then i can jump up

00:04:51.440 --> 00:04:53.700 
he lets the second i then i can jump up
the<00:04:51.560> colonnade<00:04:51.949> to<00:04:52.099> protect<00:04:52.370> i'll<00:04:52.520> spit<00:04:52.789> on

00:04:53.700 --> 00:04:53.710 
the colonnade to protect i'll spit on

00:04:53.710 --> 00:04:58.420 
the colonnade to protect i'll spit on
and<00:04:54.710> i<00:04:54.919> choose<00:04:55.130> to<00:04:55.280> do<00:04:55.370> it<00:04:55.460> that<00:04:55.639> way<00:04:55.789> and<00:04:57.430> he

00:04:58.420 --> 00:04:58.430 
and i choose to do it that way and he

00:04:58.430 --> 00:05:00.040 
and i choose to do it that way and he
does<00:04:58.580> jump<00:04:58.880> to<00:04:59.000> protect<00:04:59.330> serkan<00:04:59.750> then

00:05:00.040 --> 00:05:00.050 
does jump to protect serkan then

00:05:00.050 --> 00:05:01.480 
does jump to protect serkan then
obviously<00:05:00.259> i<00:05:00.530> play<00:05:00.740> my<00:05:00.889> war<00:05:01.099> mark<00:05:01.280> here
