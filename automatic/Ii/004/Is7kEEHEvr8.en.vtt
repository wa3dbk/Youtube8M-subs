00:00:17.230 --> 00:00:21.070
 good morning today we will learn added marked in a photograph 

00:00:22.869 --> 00:00:25.970
 This trick is very easy and allows us to unleash your imagination 

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:32.309
 once we have our photography open what we are going to do is going to be 

00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:34.950
 check that we have the image or regions 

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:38.410
 for this we will go to image in a way pierre fabre 

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:43.130
 Now what we are going to do is to select this tool to create 

00:00:43.130 --> 00:00:44.450
 the frame 

00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:47.990
 and we will select the most appropriate in our case it will be squared 

00:00:48.820 --> 00:00:52.910
 now to draw the frame let's keep the mouse pressed while 

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:55.910
 eye we draw the frame 

00:00:58.310 --> 00:01:02.240
 there is the possibility of creating laws to make it easier for them to work 

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:05.220
 you have to drag the mouse from the numbers to where we want to place the 

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:05.910
 line 

00:01:05.910 --> 00:01:09.870
 the numbers appear to us only we must go sight wants the matter 

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:14.770
 if we click on this tool we will be able to drag the stripes 

00:01:14.770 --> 00:01:17.770
 the numbers and remove the media lines so they do not disturb 

00:01:18.580 --> 00:01:22.360
 so we click on the square and draw the frame 

00:01:22.360 --> 00:01:25.810
 but we are reserved to create a mask by clicking on this icon 

00:01:25.810 --> 00:01:30.830
 now we should see the image in this way with the frame painted red 

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:36.119
 and we only have to beat this to the frame for it, we are going to go making 

00:01:36.119 --> 00:01:40.049
 choose the one that we like most we have chosen center the strokes of 

00:01:40.049 --> 00:01:42.150
 brush and splashes 

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:45.980
 a screen will appear as they are where we are going to be able to choose the radio and 

00:01:45.980 --> 00:01:49.700
 he has been designed to get the frame that we like most by moving the 

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:52.790
 lines to water down we will find the most suitable midpoint 

00:01:53.860 --> 00:01:57.159
 Now let's remove the mask by clicking on the same button 

00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:00.960
 and we will go this selection invest 

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:05.990
 let's change the color yearning by clicking on the predesigned colors all 

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:09.320
 well double-clicking on the front color we were going to choose the color that 

00:02:09.319 --> 00:02:11.629
 more we like 

00:02:11.629 --> 00:02:15.280
 we will select to pray ambienta the brush to paint the frame 

00:02:16.489 --> 00:02:20.319
 As we can see if we go over the line, nothing happens because it was thought that 

00:02:20.319 --> 00:02:23.319
 only allows them to paint within the selection 

00:02:23.929 --> 00:02:26.929
 what is the framework 

00:02:27.559 --> 00:02:30.919
 and now once we have the painted frame 

00:02:30.919 --> 00:02:33.919
 what we will do is go to selection 

00:02:35.459 --> 00:02:38.389
 to select 

00:02:38.389 --> 00:02:41.389
 This is the final result 

00:02:46.119 --> 00:02:49.949
 we can let our imagination fly by seeing a filter and try not all 

00:02:49.949 --> 00:02:53.169
 cites that is spoken is offered up against the one we like the most
