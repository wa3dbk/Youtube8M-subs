00:00:05.870 --> 00:00:10.980
 what makes walter marty check different 

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:14.429
 from other painters his canvases 

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:17.310
 move before it starts 

00:00:14.429 --> 00:00:22.650
 he needs colors templates and club 

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:25.519
 his canvas challenge is with 

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:28.220
 color brush and possibly with latex 

00:00:25.519 --> 00:00:31.859
 then dare to create beings 

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:34.559
 to totally transform the models 

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:38.010
 and then you can start with the body 

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:39.570
 painting walter manoschek has a good 20 

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:41.910
 years in his art bargaining 

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:45.030
 bodypainting colors bought and you 

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:47.809
 even tried it out in the 

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:52.890
 Art on the body can not stop 

00:00:47.809 --> 00:00:54.570
 special feature of this body painting just 

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:55.219
 times has a lively people in front 

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:58.289
 yourself 

00:00:55.219 --> 00:01:02.090
 He is not like painting on canvas 

00:00:58.289 --> 00:01:04.080
 hiding in the home kÃ¤mmerchen 

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:07.409
 opened alone was the place 

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:11.159
 communication and of course more 

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:13.530
 his paintings on the body of the model 

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:14.700
 matenchek continues to support paten 

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:17.130
 today from udo scholl 

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:19.650
 he is twice world champion in the 

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:21.840
 category airbrush walter matuschek 

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:24.500
 himself is a specialist with brushes and 

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:27.119
 sponge highest difference between 

00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:30.210
 airbrush technique and brush and sponge 

00:01:27.119 --> 00:01:32.610
 especially the one at air france 

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:33.680
 sent the color in layers 

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:36.869
 is discharged 

00:01:33.680 --> 00:01:38.640
 that means it will also surface 

00:01:36.869 --> 00:01:40.049
 applied at air france with 

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:43.880
 delicacies come with time 

00:01:40.049 --> 00:01:48.149
 more and more to the pictures while already 

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:51.600
 at least tragic at first the subtleties 

00:01:48.149 --> 00:01:53.549
 The first is technically difficult 

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:56.219
 penning and then comes the 

00:01:53.549 --> 00:01:59.940
 background that ge already has 

00:01:56.219 --> 00:02:03.760
 Experience as a bodypainting model 

00:01:59.940 --> 00:02:07.030
 orders so messe performance calendar 

00:02:03.760 --> 00:02:10.240
 and have times challenged me and thereby 

00:02:07.030 --> 00:02:11.920
 caused me contact causing her 

00:02:10.240 --> 00:02:13.480
 looking so effortless is in reality 

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:16.330
 not easy 

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:19.300
 that comes just discipline to the quiet 

00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:21.310
 Stand here you have to get in there first 

00:02:19.300 --> 00:02:24.060
 but so hard for that but it 

00:02:21.310 --> 00:02:26.550
 is a lot of fun when we had to 

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:29.020
 since 2007 the world bodypainting 

00:02:26.550 --> 00:02:34.210
 festival took place was on 

00:02:29.020 --> 00:02:36.070
 matuschek every time with it one 

00:02:34.210 --> 00:02:39.480
 my favorite pennings arose before 

00:02:36.070 --> 00:02:43.330
 a year and a half were the pending 

00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:46.720
 festival is everything 

00:02:43.330 --> 00:02:48.700
 renaissance my assistant and me 

00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:51.460
 we decided 

00:02:48.700 --> 00:02:53.020
 as the famous paintings in it is too 

00:02:51.460 --> 00:02:57.880
 perpetuate on the body 

00:02:53.020 --> 00:02:59.500
 the venus of botticelli and is us 

00:02:57.880 --> 00:03:02.320
 I think that's pretty well done 

00:02:59.500 --> 00:03:03.310
 for saskia and the two painter goes 

00:03:02.320 --> 00:03:06.820
 it in the final spurt 

00:03:03.310 --> 00:03:09.130
 every bodypainting is different 

00:03:06.820 --> 00:03:13.239
 has to be very flexible 

00:03:09.130 --> 00:03:14.709
 can also set up his model and 

00:03:13.239 --> 00:03:17.260
 Above all, it's really fun 

00:03:14.709 --> 00:03:21.300
 contact with living people is 

00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:21.300
 actually the statements 

00:03:27.090 --> 00:03:32.290
 the gardens literally from head to toe 

00:03:30.640 --> 00:03:35.680
 get a second skin 

00:03:32.290 --> 00:03:37.180
 the result can be seen 

00:03:35.680 --> 00:03:40.049
 Indian goddess Shiva on the 

00:03:37.180 --> 00:03:42.640
 front side ganesha on the back 

00:03:40.049 --> 00:03:44.470
 unfortunately there is something else that 

00:03:42.640 --> 00:03:46.930
 makes bodypainting so unique 

00:03:44.470 --> 00:03:51.450
 in the end, not only the artist has to be 

00:03:46.930 --> 00:03:51.450
 but also wash the canvas
