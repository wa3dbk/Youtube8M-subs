00:03:41.930 --> 00:03:45.610 
right there so I'll probably try to do
one<00:03:42.140> more<00:03:42.170> just<00:03:42.730> even<00:03:43.730> that<00:03:43.880> out<00:03:44.470> all<00:03:45.470> right<00:03:45.590> I

00:03:45.610 --> 00:03:45.620 
one more just even that out all right I

00:03:45.620 --> 00:03:48.280 
one more just even that out all right I
just<00:03:45.709> try<00:03:46.070> to<00:03:46.130> do<00:03:46.340> my<00:03:46.489> fifth<00:03:46.790> coat<00:03:47.090> and<00:03:47.360> forgot

00:03:48.280 --> 00:03:48.290 
just try to do my fifth coat and forgot

00:03:48.290 --> 00:03:49.990 
just try to do my fifth coat and forgot
to<00:03:48.320> clean<00:03:48.650> the<00:03:48.799> nozzle<00:03:49.010> so<00:03:49.430> I<00:03:49.519> put<00:03:49.970> one

00:03:49.990 --> 00:03:50.000 
to clean the nozzle so I put one

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:54.190 
to clean the nozzle so I put one
straight<00:03:51.459> little<00:03:52.459> line<00:03:52.670> across<00:03:52.880> there<00:03:53.420> anyway

00:03:54.190 --> 00:03:54.200 
straight little line across there anyway

00:03:54.200 --> 00:03:57.250 
straight little line across there anyway
I'll<00:03:54.799> go<00:03:54.920> ahead<00:03:55.010> with<00:03:55.130> my<00:03:55.280> fifth<00:03:55.549> coat<00:03:56.260> really

00:03:57.250 --> 00:03:57.260 
I'll go ahead with my fifth coat really

00:03:57.260 --> 00:03:59.250 
I'll go ahead with my fifth coat really
I<00:03:57.290> could<00:03:57.500> probably<00:03:57.680> get<00:03:57.890> away<00:03:57.980> with<00:03:58.100> this

00:03:59.250 --> 00:03:59.260 
I could probably get away with this

00:03:59.260 --> 00:04:02.530 
I could probably get away with this
fourth<00:04:00.260> coat<00:04:00.590> it<00:04:00.769> really<00:04:01.239> didn't<00:04:02.239> look<00:04:02.269> too

00:04:02.530 --> 00:04:02.540 
fourth coat it really didn't look too

00:04:02.540 --> 00:04:10.720 
fourth coat it really didn't look too
