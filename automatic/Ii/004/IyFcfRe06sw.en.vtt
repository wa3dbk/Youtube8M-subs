00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:07.990
 even though today is a beautiful day in 

00:00:06.520 --> 00:00:09.820
 my city I have many things to say 

00:00:07.990 --> 00:00:11.409
 about her good goats welcome 

00:00:09.820 --> 00:00:12.820
 of incoherent marc today I will say my 

00:00:11.409 --> 00:00:14.379
 opinion about my city also that 

00:00:12.820 --> 00:00:15.759
 you do not share with her everyone has her 

00:00:14.379 --> 00:00:16.869
 own vision of things and in the end 

00:00:15.759 --> 00:00:18.220
 is in my videos should I say what 

00:00:16.869 --> 00:00:19.870
 you want while you do not insult others 

00:00:18.220 --> 00:00:21.190
 when I can not anymore if everything I hope 

00:00:19.870 --> 00:00:22.960
 have a chance to give it very well 

00:00:21.190 --> 00:00:24.430
 let's start chile metropolitan region 

00:00:22.960 --> 00:00:25.960
 santiago santiago is a very 

00:00:24.430 --> 00:00:27.070
 cute if you think there are many people 

00:00:25.960 --> 00:00:28.780
 foreigner who comes here for his 

00:00:27.070 --> 00:00:30.250
 vacation they do not complain I think expensive 

00:00:28.780 --> 00:00:31.660
 because it does not happen every day every day 

00:00:30.250 --> 00:00:32.980
 because something that happens to you very often and 

00:00:31.660 --> 00:00:34.629
 transform into routine you may 

00:00:32.980 --> 00:00:36.309
 bother but santiago bothers by itself 

00:00:34.629 --> 00:00:37.839
 there are only good things and bad things 

00:00:36.309 --> 00:00:39.280
 I'll start with good things that there is not 

00:00:37.839 --> 00:00:40.420
 a lot to say maybe a good part 

00:00:39.280 --> 00:00:42.129
 of my city is that it's all 

00:00:40.420 --> 00:00:43.989
 centralized here everything is within reach 

00:00:42.129 --> 00:00:45.429
 from his hand he wants his supermarket and what 

00:00:43.989 --> 00:00:47.289
 has there jobs how difficult is 

00:00:45.429 --> 00:00:49.300
 find it on the other hand generally 

00:00:47.289 --> 00:00:51.159
 the events that take place in the country 

00:00:49.300 --> 00:00:52.899
 they concentrate in the capital and the capital is 

00:00:51.159 --> 00:00:54.339
 santiago in the city that I live by 

00:00:52.899 --> 00:00:55.960
 so anything you want 

00:00:54.339 --> 00:00:57.339
 go will be here if one feels to see 

00:00:55.960 --> 00:00:58.870
 television what you will find in 

00:00:57.339 --> 00:01:00.579
 the news is going to relate the 

00:00:58.870 --> 00:01:02.109
 most almón santiago actually this 

00:01:00.579 --> 00:01:03.339
 would happen to be the bad part so the 

00:01:02.109 --> 00:01:04.570
 list of good things is finished 

00:01:03.339 --> 00:01:06.280
 inside bad things dogs 

00:01:04.570 --> 00:01:06.690
 evil street of those who carry the 

00:01:06.280 --> 00:01:07.980
 dogs 

00:01:06.690 --> 00:01:09.750
 I ride a lot and the 

00:01:07.980 --> 00:01:11.340
 damn they always chase me past in 

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:13.080
 the area in the morning are attentive to 

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:14.400
 any cyclist are put in the middle of 

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:15.720
 the street for us is enough 

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:17.310
 finally a place with eight laps 

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:18.930
 to enter the house the people very 

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:20.550
 responsible and leaves their dogs outside more 

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:22.140
 the number of stray dogs 

00:01:20.550 --> 00:01:24.030
 more I should bet there are more pigeons 

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:25.710
 and dogs that people in santiago something else 

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:27.360
 What I do not like about Santiago is the smog 

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:28.260
 curses that have been smelling 

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:30.270
 good that people are used to 

00:01:28.260 --> 00:01:31.890
 God is good care come out some 

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:33.960
 any street will be last of 

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:37.380
 oak already done I know how to differentiate the 

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:38.580
 how many 93 octane or 95 is that impute me 

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:40.050
 be the only part that is that for 

00:01:38.580 --> 00:01:41.700
 stop with damn smells are the 

00:01:40.050 --> 00:01:43.440
 lucky places with Santiago there are many 

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:44.970
 green areas above all providence in 

00:01:43.440 --> 00:01:46.530
 the upper part sadly like me 

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:48.150
 I am poor alive, the lower part remains 

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:49.560
 an hour and a half of coffee and I can not 

00:01:48.150 --> 00:01:50.940
 To complain a lot and you have to walk by bike 

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:52.470
 at least some good since I'm not 

00:01:50.940 --> 00:01:54.210
 doing a wrong buying me another car 

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:55.380
 to pollute the city something else that 

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:57.330
 I can not stand Santiago is the 

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:59.010
 overpopulation I spent 20 years of my life 

00:01:57.330 --> 00:02:00.690
 walking collective locomotion and I know what 

00:01:59.010 --> 00:02:02.610
 it feels to walk on the puntometer or on the 

00:02:00.690 --> 00:02:04.260
 black at the peak hours code first 

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:05.940
 the heat is unbearable the second whole 

00:02:04.260 --> 00:02:08.100
 people walk and wave with so much third 

00:02:05.940 --> 00:02:09.780
 You have how to move, it's as if you are deprived 

00:02:08.100 --> 00:02:11.610
 of fourth freedom the people are very 

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:12.700
 Stressed the roses unintentionally and 

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:14.709
 they annoy you 

00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:16.330
 you get annoyed you ask the time unintentionally and 

00:02:14.709 --> 00:02:17.530
 it bothers you is that you see so many people 

00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:19.120
 accumulated in the same place is 

00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:20.920
 Stressful in the center of Santiago 

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:22.599
 where you walk there is a grave that is 

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:24.099
 living against you can not be 

00:02:22.599 --> 00:02:25.720
 relaxed unless you leave the 

00:02:24.099 --> 00:02:27.430
 paths the streets do not stay either 

00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:28.540
 out there are too many cars I know that a 

00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:30.280
 more than one of you has touched 

00:02:28.540 --> 00:02:31.900
 to be has a giant cue in which 

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:33.550
 you would like to get out of the micro because 

00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:35.110
 you know that walking would get you more 

00:02:33.550 --> 00:02:36.610
 early because of this I bought myself a 

00:02:35.110 --> 00:02:38.170
 vision that thinks about it well you save yourself from 

00:02:36.610 --> 00:02:39.940
 all those problems and also not 

00:02:38.170 --> 00:02:41.739
 you contaminate me I take even less 

00:02:39.940 --> 00:02:43.030
 traveling by bicycle that traveling micro 

00:02:41.739 --> 00:02:44.590
 everyone has things of what 

00:02:43.030 --> 00:02:46.030
 complain about the place where he lives is 

00:02:44.590 --> 00:02:47.500
 one of them a lot of people who live in 

00:02:46.030 --> 00:02:49.150
 regions has told me today that to me 

00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:50.890
 love santiago if I could go there 

00:02:49.150 --> 00:02:52.180
 would be the happiest person in the world is 

00:02:50.890 --> 00:02:53.950
 who say that the regions are very 

00:02:52.180 --> 00:02:55.959
 boring everything happen santiago and in 

00:02:53.950 --> 00:02:57.640
 actually if a lot of things happen here is 

00:02:55.959 --> 00:02:59.290
 full of nightclubs is full of peace 

00:02:57.640 --> 00:03:01.510
 is full of museums is full of 

00:02:59.290 --> 00:03:03.670
 cultural spaces is full of theater 

00:03:01.510 --> 00:03:05.530
 is fantasyland there are many centers 

00:03:03.670 --> 00:03:07.030
 commercials etcetera on the other hand people 

00:03:05.530 --> 00:03:08.680
 de santiago the only thing he wants is to leave 

00:03:07.030 --> 00:03:10.269
 to vacation in some other region of the 

00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:12.040
 chile since in those places life is 

00:03:10.269 --> 00:03:13.750
 quieter things so relaxed the 

00:03:12.040 --> 00:03:15.459
 people are kinder and all the people are 

00:03:13.750 --> 00:03:17.290
 know at home since things are more 

00:03:15.459 --> 00:03:18.390
 cheap there is not so much crime for the 

00:03:17.290 --> 00:03:20.160
 fact of having less 

00:03:18.390 --> 00:03:21.480
 and less things than stealing it since if 

00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:23.430
 you will live in a region instead of 

00:03:21.480 --> 00:03:24.959
 santiago would prefer to be in santiago 

00:03:23.430 --> 00:03:26.670
 there are many people who love their region 

00:03:24.959 --> 00:03:28.110
 how do you like a video those people the 

00:03:26.670 --> 00:03:29.730
 I really like Santiago and I do not 

00:03:28.110 --> 00:03:31.110
 I would like to leave here for a long time 

00:03:29.730 --> 00:03:32.490
 done when I go to regions I feel 

00:03:31.110 --> 00:03:33.870
 not at home as I would be of 

00:03:32.490 --> 00:03:35.340
 back here quiet but good so 

00:03:33.870 --> 00:03:36.959
 life like this are things sometimes the 

00:03:35.340 --> 00:03:38.220
 we call sometimes we hate each other and if 

00:03:36.959 --> 00:03:40.170
 I had to give a percentage that 

00:03:38.220 --> 00:03:41.850
 will indicate how much I like santiago del 1 

00:03:40.170 --> 00:03:44.010
 at 100 I would say that I city I like the 

00:03:41.850 --> 00:03:46.050
 60% I know there are many bad things and 

00:03:44.010 --> 00:03:47.700
 done this video it was almost about hating 

00:03:46.050 --> 00:03:49.410
 to my city however I already move in 

00:03:47.700 --> 00:03:51.060
 this world here I have met very people 

00:03:49.410 --> 00:03:52.590
 valuable and also I'm used to 

00:03:51.060 --> 00:03:54.450
 think about what does not kill you makes you more 

00:03:52.590 --> 00:03:56.459
 strong and if you look at it from that point of 

00:03:54.450 --> 00:03:58.170
 View in Santiago makes you a beast 

00:03:56.459 --> 00:03:59.730
 well let's go now I would like to know what 

00:03:58.170 --> 00:04:01.110
 do you think your city leaves the 

00:03:59.730 --> 00:04:02.700
 comments what do you like the most? 

00:04:01.110 --> 00:04:04.170
 of your city and what you least like and 

00:04:02.700 --> 00:04:05.580
 the last one ends up giving a percentage 

00:04:04.170 --> 00:04:07.350
 I am sea ​​well remember that you are in the 

00:04:05.580 --> 00:04:09.030

 be anything and of course I will 

00:04:12.360 --> 00:04:15.690
 your comment in the next video is very 

00:04:14.190 --> 00:04:17.400
 valuable to give your opinion is the way that 

00:04:15.690 --> 00:04:19.320
 I have to download so in this channel 

00:04:17.400 --> 00:04:20.880
 I know you will find very little criticism 

00:04:19.320 --> 00:04:22.470
 constructive but good that they are very 

00:04:20.880 --> 00:04:25.050
 well see you in a next video not 

00:04:22.470 --> 00:04:28.379
 we went here we see a machine 

00:04:25.050 --> 00:04:31.190
 to the floor of santiago but that contaminates 

00:04:28.379 --> 00:04:31.190
 the air of santiago 

00:04:31.520 --> 00:04:34.900
 we are geniuses
