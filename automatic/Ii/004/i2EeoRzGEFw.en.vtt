00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.279
 you tell me stiff hair I do not know 

00:00:04.380 --> 00:00:07.279
 how I feel 

00:00:11.100 --> 00:00:15.930
 and I felt that 2014 was a year of test 

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:17.880
 a lot of new things that I never 

00:00:15.930 --> 00:00:19.740
 I had dared to try and others that 

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:21.840
 I had tried before but that 

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:23.820
 I just had forgotten you're 

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:26.220
 using I had already made them a video 

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:28.500
 complete about all the shampoos that 

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:30.720
 I love to use and they are the best 

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:32.460
 for my hair and the dj's you want and 

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:34.559
 organic are at the top of my list 

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:36.660
 because they are organic do not contain 

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:38.760
 sulfate and are the products less 

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:41.309
 harmful I have found in the 

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:43.739
 supermarkets in terms of repairers 

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:46.559
 hair and the tips and those things 

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:48.059
 it's less likely that if you use them when 

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:50.460
 you do not have the problem they are going to help you 

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:52.559
 very much and the first is this eva in 

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:53.729
 wise and continence and argan tea 

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:55.890
 moisturize your hair 

00:00:53.729 --> 00:00:58.620
 incredibly I make them very many 

00:00:55.890 --> 00:01:00.540
 oils that promise wonders for you 

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:02.940
 hair and I just felt that I 

00:01:00.540 --> 00:01:05.760
 they left on a camel I do not know greasy and 

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:08.040
 that was all I did not feel that really my 

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:10.140
 hair was absorbing what more 

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:11.760
 I like it is that you can use it as a 

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:13.560
 heat shield received when 

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:16.290
 finish bathing the first thing I do 

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:19.140
 is to put a little bit of this in the 

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:21.150
 at hand and I spend it for everything 

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:23.490
 are the tips or what is from here of 

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:26.580
 the ears down this one really 

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:28.710
 this mega recommended and maintains is a 

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:30.900
 brand of which I fell in love again this 

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:33.600
 last year I do not know why I was throwing 

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:36.030
 very much in Mexico and I was fascinated 

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:38.280
 You also use this one after bathing 

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:40.170
 I have done all your hair if you know 

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:42.390
 that you are going to cancel does not leave your hair 

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:45.240
 sticky for nothing you leave it super 

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:46.860
 hydrated and your hair is wavy 

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:49.650
 I really recommend it apart from that 

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:52.050
 removes the frizz and protects it and this is the 

00:01:49.650 --> 00:01:55.140
 next hall of bread dni here has a few 

00:01:52.050 --> 00:01:58.170
 numbers says 1 2 3 4 that is the level 

00:01:55.140 --> 00:02:00.030
 of fixed that gives you this is number 1 

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:02.040
 and how can you realize what 

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:04.890
 tango put right now it's not like my 

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:06.979
 hair will look if super 10 this I used it 

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:09.929
 a lot during the summer of last year 

00:02:06.979 --> 00:02:12.090
 but sincerely already as for the 

00:02:09.929 --> 00:02:14.580
 This winter I did not like it much 

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:17.310
 because give your hair is that 

00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:18.900
 finished as beach and for summer 

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:20.730
 It's fine but already like for winter 

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:22.830
 it does not look very good 

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:24.569
 they are rather like to give it a texture 

00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:26.459
 a little thicker to my hair than my 

00:02:24.569 --> 00:02:28.110
 hair is already thick because when I 

00:02:26.459 --> 00:02:30.569
 It makes my hair feel like I have left 

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:33.000
 too much I do not know how crushed as 

00:02:30.569 --> 00:02:35.250
 too drained but this product 

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:37.319
 It helps me to texture my hair and 

00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:39.540
 give it a little more volume never had 

00:02:37.319 --> 00:02:42.360
 had a dryer that would leave my 

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:44.790
 hair much better after before 

00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:46.590
 dry it the technology that is used is 

00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:48.660
 like ion I think that that's also 

00:02:46.590 --> 00:02:51.030
 part of the reason why he is now 

00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:52.950
 much healthier even when I already 

00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:54.510
 I made the wicks and you are looking for a 

00:02:52.950 --> 00:02:56.910
 dryer and I'm not talking about that 

00:02:54.510 --> 00:02:59.430
 buy this but look for one that has 

00:02:56.910 --> 00:03:00.989
 this ion technology I thought that 

00:02:59.430 --> 00:03:03.239
 that was pure jet 

00:03:00.989 --> 00:03:05.310
 the truth but I already verified that no I 

00:03:03.239 --> 00:03:08.459
 had one that supposedly had the 

00:03:05.310 --> 00:03:10.590
 same technology and it was not for nothing 

00:03:08.459 --> 00:03:13.019
 I left my hair super I do not know super 

00:03:10.590 --> 00:03:15.150
 I dry up that and I always 

00:03:13.019 --> 00:03:17.819
 they ask what I do that is what 

00:03:15.150 --> 00:03:19.560
 that I use because I told them everything 

00:03:17.819 --> 00:03:21.690
 I use everything I do to curl the 

00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:24.060
 hair but I have to give a lot of credit 

00:03:21.690 --> 00:03:26.760
 this is heated very quickly to more than 

00:03:24.060 --> 00:03:30.120
 400 degrees of temperature with the same 

00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:31.590
 does not have a pincer here for I do not know for 

00:03:30.120 --> 00:03:33.659
 squeeze the hair I feel that I 

00:03:31.590 --> 00:03:36.209
 mistreats hair much less 

00:03:33.659 --> 00:03:38.370
 because that also warmed me the 

00:03:36.209 --> 00:03:39.810
 hair very much in which they had like this 

00:03:38.370 --> 00:03:43.049
 those with the pincer that opens and 

00:03:39.810 --> 00:03:44.819
 closes are definitely less 

00:03:43.049 --> 00:03:46.739
 harmful that if we conclude these 

00:03:44.819 --> 00:03:48.780
 my baby hair favorites if you have 

00:03:46.739 --> 00:03:50.970
 any recommendation for me leave me the 

00:03:48.780 --> 00:03:53.629
 in the comments I love them and 

00:03:50.970 --> 00:03:53.629
 I send kisses
