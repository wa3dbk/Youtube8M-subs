played pocket god on my ipad i realized
it<00:03:42.760> wasn't<00:03:42.970> really<00:03:43.239> necessary<00:03:44.820> the<00:03:45.820> graphics

00:03:46.050 --> 00:03:46.060 
it wasn't really necessary the graphics

00:03:46.060 --> 00:03:47.729 
it wasn't really necessary the graphics
still<00:03:46.450> looks<00:03:46.660> really<00:03:46.989> good<00:03:47.109> the<00:03:47.290> sound<00:03:47.590> is

00:03:47.729 --> 00:03:47.739

really<00:03:47.890> great<00:03:48.190> so<00:03:48.880> even<00:03:49.150> if<00:03:49.239> they<00:03:49.329> come<00:03:49.480> out

00:03:49.590 --> 00:03:49.600 
really great so even if they come out

00:03:49.600 --> 00:03:51.300 
really great so even if they come out
with<00:03:49.630> one<00:03:49.959> for<00:03:50.109> the<00:03:50.170> ipad<00:03:50.470> unless<00:03:50.980> it<00:03:51.130> has
