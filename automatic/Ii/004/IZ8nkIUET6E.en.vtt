00:00:07.480 --> 00:00:12.799
 and 

00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:15.469
 a couple of months ago we tried here in tn 

00:00:12.799 --> 00:00:17.630
 cars the new toyota corolla we chose 

00:00:15.469 --> 00:00:20.270
 for that first evaluation a unit 

00:00:17.630 --> 00:00:22.279
 with the new automatic cbt box 

00:00:20.270 --> 00:00:25.160
 continuous drive that showed a 

00:00:22.279 --> 00:00:26.899
 efficient functioning today in change 

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:29.599
 we went to the conventional version 

00:00:26.899 --> 00:00:31.340
 with 6-speed manual gearbox all 

00:00:29.599 --> 00:00:34.820
 Corolla sold in the country has 

00:00:31.340 --> 00:00:36.739
 the gasoline engine 1.8 of 140 horses and 

00:00:34.820 --> 00:00:40.010
 the unit that we tested has a level of 

00:00:36.739 --> 00:00:43.130
 equipment x pack only surpassed by the 

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:45.980
 full that axis that was already reached by the 

00:00:43.130 --> 00:00:48.079
 automotive tax but what else we 

00:00:45.980 --> 00:00:50.090
 interested in this opportunity is how 

00:00:48.079 --> 00:00:52.400
 renders this mechanics with the manual box 

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:55.730
 that has a change selector very 

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:57.860
 accurate and fast in addition to soft 

00:00:55.730 --> 00:00:59.540
 likewise the relations of boxes are 

00:00:57.860 --> 00:01:01.790
 appropriate with the first gears 

00:00:59.540 --> 00:01:03.829
 short to give you agility in the city 

00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:06.229
 and a long sixth that lowers the 

00:01:03.829 --> 00:01:08.240
 revolutions of the engine en route is 

00:01:06.229 --> 00:01:10.909
 as at 130 kilometers per hour 

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:13.009
 rotates at just 3300 revolutions per 

00:01:10.909 --> 00:01:16.100
 minutes favoring the consumption that 

00:01:13.009 --> 00:01:18.770
 that speed is 76 liters per 100 

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:20.840
 kilometers in the city the expense amounts to 

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:23.750
 10 liters which is also not bad for 

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:26.050
 its power and the 1,300 kilos of this 

00:01:23.750 --> 00:01:26.050
 bodywork 

00:01:26.890 --> 00:01:30.659
 in consumption there are almost no differences 

00:01:29.140 --> 00:01:33.490
 Regarding the automatic version 

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:35.140
 neither in the acceleration since zero 

00:01:33.490 --> 00:01:38.380
 at one hundred kilometers per hour the manual 

00:01:35.140 --> 00:01:40.810
 it takes the same 92 seconds that per 

00:01:38.380 --> 00:01:42.250
 true is a good figure for your 140 

00:01:40.810 --> 00:01:44.320
 horses 

00:01:42.250 --> 00:01:46.270
 that is the maximum speed where the 

00:01:44.320 --> 00:01:49.170
 manual is imposed as it exceeds the 

00:01:46.270 --> 00:01:52.600
 Automatic 7 kilometers reaching 

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:54.850
 207 kilometers per hour apparently with 

00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:57.010
 This mechanical manual gearbox also 

00:01:54.850 --> 00:01:58.979
 has shown very efficient standing out 

00:01:57.010 --> 00:02:01.840
 also for its smoothness of operation 

00:01:58.979 --> 00:02:04.210
 something that adds points especially in the 

00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:06.100
 city where corolla offers a nice 

00:02:04.210 --> 00:02:08.479
 ride comfort and a very good 

00:02:06.100 --> 00:02:10.670
 address 

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:12.260
 the criticizable points of this chorus the 

00:02:10.670 --> 00:02:14.569
 hand are similar to those of 

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:16.599
 automatic on the security side 

00:02:14.569 --> 00:02:19.549
 the lack of stability control 

00:02:16.599 --> 00:02:22.370
 We also point out equipment to 

00:02:19.549 --> 00:02:25.910
 just that it shows certain missing and 

00:02:22.370 --> 00:02:27.920
 of course the price costs 242 thousand 

00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:30.110
 weights is to say that it is on the edge of 

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:32.390
 tax although it is known that in some 

00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:36.260
 dealers already offer it to more than 

00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:38.540
 300 thousand the best of the corolla is the 

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:40.450
 efficiency of your engine and how well you 

00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:43.700
 feel the six-speed manual gearbox 

00:02:40.450 --> 00:02:45.799
 its benefits and consumption are also 

00:02:43.700 --> 00:02:48.650
 points in favor as well as the comfort of 

00:02:45.799 --> 00:02:51.200
 marches the spaciousness of the carrier and still 

00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:53.989
 without control stability some aspects 

00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:55.970
 of safety like its five airbags the 

00:02:53.989 --> 00:02:58.069
 efficient deformation of the body 

00:02:55.970 --> 00:03:00.200
 the brakes that stop the car in 

00:02:58.069 --> 00:03:03.230
 Exhausted distances and low lights 

00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:06.019
 with LED technology has known is that the 

00:03:03.230 --> 00:03:08.720
 Corolla does not awaken passions even with a 

00:03:06.019 --> 00:03:11.359
 New design more attractive is a sedan 

00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:14.080
 conventional whose arguments are the 

00:03:11.359 --> 00:03:16.930
 efficiency and reliability 

00:03:14.080 --> 00:03:19.030
 or those premises plus what is read is the car 

00:03:16.930 --> 00:03:23.250
 best-selling story and its purchase 

00:03:19.030 --> 00:03:23.250
 it is always a good investment
