00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:14.000
 hello world and and today 

00:00:11.590 --> 00:00:18.170
 agenda 

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:20.270
 you new technology force 15 16 let's 

00:00:18.170 --> 00:00:22.160
 tell you what it is about 

00:00:20.270 --> 00:00:24.110
 because to understand this as 

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:27.790
 always what usual bottle is impossible 

00:00:24.110 --> 00:00:27.790
 in fact everything is simple and 

00:00:28.270 --> 00:00:35.260
 many promises to both called 4d 

00:00:32.920 --> 00:00:36.879
 This is a recent 3d scott like that 

00:00:35.260 --> 00:00:40.539
 Lazovic invoice added 

00:00:36.879 --> 00:00:43.149
 before x4 . mean so 1 to this 

00:00:40.539 --> 00:00:45.550
 classic anti-hero line into the camera and 

00:00:43.149 --> 00:00:47.890
 from the outside have already figured out how to 

00:00:45.550 --> 00:00:50.310
 Our rush year were glad more like as 

00:00:47.890 --> 00:00:54.660
 then grown together 

00:00:50.310 --> 00:00:56.670
 we can not now added bend i 

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:57.000
 I do not know how to say the cross is that it is 

00:00:56.670 --> 00:00:59.370
 there is 

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:02.480
 essay rocker sold it now here 

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:06.510
 there is also a transverse lion 

00:01:02.480 --> 00:01:08.880
 it turns out that the sock and heel are bent and 

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:12.930
 which tooth convex made in different 

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:18.020
 parties toe convex upward as a couple 

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:21.170
 garden on the contrary made many as it were 

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:23.509
 boats on a spoon to sliding 

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:25.520
 the surface here is naturally smooth but 

00:01:23.509 --> 00:01:27.170
 entrails they are like that 

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:30.950
 that is due to this 

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:33.500
 due to this commodity part of us to you 

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:35.509
 one turn to wear becomes 

00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:37.610
 a little tighter and pressure 

00:01:35.509 --> 00:01:39.580
 go to the inside tap which 

00:01:37.610 --> 00:01:42.610
 charging 

00:01:39.580 --> 00:01:45.120
 due to curved sti backs another 

00:01:42.610 --> 00:01:47.190
 side well should be happening 

00:01:45.120 --> 00:01:49.200
 calmer way out of the turn can 

00:01:47.190 --> 00:01:50.880
 be even softer there 

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:53.520
 slipping 

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:55.710
 in general tourlan in some models there 

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:58.020
 There were words of Ustinov soft side 

00:01:55.710 --> 00:01:59.610
 slip here there is hope that 

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:03.110
 it will not be as though 

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:05.530
 well, plus that's technology here 

00:02:03.110 --> 00:02:08.960
 you will ask to be fulfilled more and 

00:02:05.530 --> 00:02:11.990
 bent technology would create fatter 

00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:15.470
 bti that is it fixes the bent 

00:02:11.990 --> 00:02:16.600
 original due to this leads to 30 

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:18.720
 percent 

00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:21.330
 decrease 

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:24.000
 1 and the nasal , I do not know how to calculate 

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:26.280
 what exactly 30 percent is like 

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:28.320
 I do not really know who is trying to dog 

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:32.550
 food say they got even better 

00:02:28.320 --> 00:02:34.590
 so here it is worth believing but in any 

00:02:32.550 --> 00:02:36.390
 case like all the ring and the wife then thousand all 

00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:38.790
 again we need to test 

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:40.650
 speak only technology further we 

00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:43.110
 let's go along the rulers and I will tell 

00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:45.720
 what exactly is skiing and technology 

00:02:43.110 --> 00:02:48.210
 applied because ivan him all skis 

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:50.400
 stuck it 4d such a single line 

00:02:48.210 --> 00:02:52.320
 so not to miss the video already 

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:53.650
 specifically they are not so signed 

00:02:52.320 --> 00:02:55.959
 channel 

00:02:53.650 --> 00:02:57.640
 we'll go make out every strongly-strongly 

00:02:55.959 --> 00:02:59.260
 just what a lot of 

00:02:57.640 --> 00:03:01.330
 plans and above 

00:02:59.260 --> 00:03:04.590
 have such a long signed channel 

00:03:01.330 --> 00:03:04.590
 put the video like this for now
