00:00:00.999 --> 00:00:02.840
 now let's see 

00:00:02.840 --> 00:00:04.190
 how to program 

00:00:04.190 --> 00:00:06.470
 moscufo with vertical display 

00:00:06.470 --> 00:00:09.710
 approval for automatic switching on and off 

00:00:15.389 --> 00:00:18.630
 these three quarters are the ones that start to program his 

00:00:19.349 --> 00:00:21.859
 the others do not touch them 

00:00:21.859 --> 00:00:25.109
 because one thing must be entered in the appropriate menu 

00:00:25.109 --> 00:00:29.130
 to do business that jumps exhausted many times until the small light comes on 

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:31.829
 green above this clock 

00:00:31.829 --> 00:00:33.149
 I recommend this 

00:00:33.149 --> 00:00:35.050
 not that other one this q 

00:00:35.050 --> 00:00:36.840
 nutcracker mirror 

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:37.970
 and turned on 

00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:42.200
 selva dorado will pass by joking this can come out to start to water 

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:46.140
 facebook madagascar 

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:49.860
 the first item of this menu is the stove of whom day is today as it is 

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:51.480
 putty you have to suffer 

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:53.450
 current day and time for which 

00:00:53.450 --> 00:00:57.270
 used as a reference for the automatic shutdown sale I will make 

00:00:59.200 --> 00:01:00.990
 through these two keys 

00:01:00.990 --> 00:01:03.990
 we don't move the days of the week 

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:06.840
 office uses ours 

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:10.450
 sccop means that we basically don't want to use the programmer 

00:01:10.450 --> 00:01:13.810
 weekly the other days we need precisely 

00:01:13.810 --> 00:01:16.390
 to say what day it is today 

00:01:16.390 --> 00:01:20.330
 no monday tuesday will accept but riccione mum 

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:23.780
 let's say no coding in which there is gods one morning of the 7th 

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:27.740
 where for a lecturer on the first day of the week so you don't see 

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:30.770
 and so until the weekend when Sunday evening 

00:01:32.350 --> 00:01:36.270
 then of the 1d Monday of the two Tuesdays Bentel Wednesday dry feet 

00:01:37.660 --> 00:01:41.340
 today is Saturday for example then or I must say vasco concerto spears testo il 

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:43.890
 day of the week you are always 

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:46.969
 done this press this button to pass at least 2 

00:01:47.950 --> 00:01:50.950
 in 2002 asked what time it is now 

00:01:51.890 --> 00:01:56.500
 so now it's 15 and 30 challenge us I eat a lot but I write for you how 

00:01:56.500 --> 00:01:58.970
 a digital alarm clock 

00:01:58.970 --> 00:02:02.680
 the new man presses the button to pass me hotmail and has not asked for bismarck 

00:02:02.680 --> 00:02:07.470
 xheystyles of course with these two keys various data as you have seen 

00:02:07.470 --> 00:02:10.470
 and with this confirmation I pass the next item 

00:02:11.309 --> 00:02:14.829
 the 4q item is not taken into consideration because a parameter for 

00:02:14.829 --> 00:02:18.149
 the technicians passed from outside to item 5 

00:02:18.149 --> 00:02:21.539
 item 5 is asked for the time of the first ignition 

00:02:22.589 --> 00:02:26.129
 My name is, let's not talk about people, the stucco leaves at 7am 

00:02:26.839 --> 00:02:30.129
 through these two keys we simulate 

00:02:30.129 --> 00:02:34.619
 ea * 10pt how are we now claudia but I'll call you 7 in the morning 

00:02:35.669 --> 00:02:39.079
 after which the castel del monte voice jokes in this passage 

00:02:40.039 --> 00:02:42.299
 and I'm asked 

00:02:42.299 --> 00:02:45.950
 the time of the first shutdown we put that we need the 10 a 

00:02:45.949 --> 00:02:47.769
 star stove systems then 

00:02:47.769 --> 00:02:50.379
 same thing happened to one of those buttons 

00:02:50.379 --> 00:02:53.379
 written that at 10e30 the stove goes out 

00:02:54.029 --> 00:02:55.599
 new confirmations 

00:02:55.599 --> 00:02:57.900
 in parameter 7 I am asked 

00:02:57.900 --> 00:03:00.900
 this thing a little more complicated to understand 

00:03:01.429 --> 00:03:05.589
 when I want this power-down ignition to be done during the 

00:03:05.589 --> 00:03:08.699
 week so on which days of the week I want this to happen 

00:03:09.939 --> 00:03:11.919
 what will happen the writing 

00:03:11.919 --> 00:03:14.000
 off one I had to say that Monday 

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:18.580
 the stove does nothing through this '' ask vucinic button if this days of 

00:03:18.580 --> 00:03:21.049
 vip week that i am 

00:03:21.049 --> 00:03:25.109
 xena day of these I want you to do this ignition so well said by the 

00:03:25.109 --> 00:03:28.809
 7 to 10:30 I have to put it we allow kennedy 

00:03:28.809 --> 00:03:34.559
 I go to work so I want to click on Tuesday as even Wednesday 20 add 

00:03:34.559 --> 00:03:35.209
 also 

00:03:35.209 --> 00:03:38.209
 midi karaoke Saturday and Sunday I don't care 

00:03:39.189 --> 00:03:40.599
 step forward 

00:03:40.599 --> 00:03:43.609
 he asks me about the second ignition time 

00:03:45.659 --> 00:03:47.759
 my name is that 

00:03:47.759 --> 00:03:52.069
 first home to eat at 13 poles class to caritas caxxx 

00:03:54.789 --> 00:03:57.479
 I confirm tour pass parameter 9 

00:03:57.479 --> 00:04:00.279
 he asked me for the time 

00:04:00.279 --> 00:04:03.529
 on the second shutdown we say that I leave home at 15e30 

00:04:07.019 --> 00:04:10.019
 crack 

00:04:11.039 --> 00:04:13.729
 same thing is asked of you 

00:04:13.729 --> 00:04:16.779
 to the parameter tell us what days I want this to happen 

00:04:16.779 --> 00:04:21.669
 my name is simps as the first true that the babysitter mars there is jacket with xp 

00:04:21.669 --> 00:04:22.949
 *Yes 

00:04:22.949 --> 00:04:24.340
 refrain 

00:04:24.340 --> 00:04:27.940
 Saturday and Sunday not because I am at home for example I manage it 

00:04:30.169 --> 00:04:34.969
 in the old stoves with the old microprocessor there were only two 

00:04:36.900 --> 00:04:41.430
 There are 2 despini mention ignitions to these new microprocessor stew 

00:04:41.430 --> 00:04:42.800
 of the 4 

00:04:42.800 --> 00:04:45.139
 access en-el4 spinning 

00:04:45.139 --> 00:04:49.509
 say that the same thing will be asked twice more, so just repeat it or 

00:04:49.509 --> 00:04:50.990
 schedule 

00:04:50.990 --> 00:04:53.669
 furthermore there are moral born shutting down 

00:04:53.669 --> 00:04:57.319
 the days when this of a future is again the same thing 

00:04:57.319 --> 00:05:00.770
 when the programming ended when I finished programming it 

00:05:00.770 --> 00:05:03.129
 I tax this way 

00:05:03.129 --> 00:05:06.430
 you see that this little light under the clock is hanging 

00:05:06.430 --> 00:05:10.770
 what this means means that the pellet stove mode programmed 

00:05:10.770 --> 00:05:13.009
 then a stove will start to go out 

00:05:13.009 --> 00:05:15.059
 then we also said 

00:05:15.059 --> 00:05:17.229
 in the days we have of 

00:05:17.229 --> 00:05:20.800
 if for some reason we don't need to use the programmer 

00:05:21.339 --> 00:05:26.080
 to disable it, just go back to the first item I taught you that magic 

00:05:26.080 --> 00:05:29.969
 press button 7 until the small light above this clock lights up 

00:05:30.689 --> 00:05:33.689
 instead of the current day according to the right contribution 

00:05:34.520 --> 00:05:38.560
 and without needing to redo everything as immediately as possible with this face 

00:05:39.360 --> 00:05:44.409
 as you can see the light has gone here means that the stove sprogramma that 

00:05:44.409 --> 00:05:46.400
 the stove all memory 

00:05:46.400 --> 00:05:49.319
 current time 

00:05:49.319 --> 00:05:51.020
 and also memory 

00:05:51.020 --> 00:05:55.129
 children switching on and off norms about memories what day is for us today 

00:05:55.129 --> 00:05:56.699
 he has no day 

00:05:56.699 --> 00:06:00.840
 if we want to rehabilitate chrome it will be enough to re-enter the first kennel 

00:06:00.840 --> 00:06:02.759
 crucible j rock 

00:06:02.759 --> 00:06:06.270
 as I said at the beginning of the green light above the clock and at the 

00:06:06.270 --> 00:06:10.039
 place of the foxprice writing of the day today so let's say that this end 

00:06:10.039 --> 00:06:13.360
 week they gave the programmer but from a Tunisian in polystyrene 

00:06:13.930 --> 00:06:17.949
 tunisia I will write to you on the first day of the week pirastu cableway 

00:06:17.949 --> 00:06:18.979
 Gemini 

00:06:18.979 --> 00:06:22.169
 and there is no need to redo everything because the other data on 

00:06:22.169 --> 00:06:25.240
 memory therefore it will be enough to exit conciato of the ignition 

00:06:25.240 --> 00:06:27.830
 she stewed planned 

00:06:27.830 --> 00:06:29.480
 quite simple sleep.
