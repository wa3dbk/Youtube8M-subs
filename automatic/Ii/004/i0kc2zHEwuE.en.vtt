we<00:00:26.910> all<00:00:26.939> thought<00:00:27.210> it<00:00:27.269> was<00:00:27.480> done<00:00:27.630> and<00:00:27.779> dusted

00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:27.930 
we all thought it was done and dusted

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:31.189 
we all thought it was done and dusted
but<00:00:28.529> EA<00:00:28.740> have<00:00:29.189> come<00:00:29.519> up<00:00:29.730> with<00:00:30.240> one<00:00:30.570> last<00:00:30.900> final

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:34.110 
that's the final one and they've given

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:35.840 
that's the final one and they've given

and<00:01:13.409> then<00:01:13.500> we<00:01:13.560> got<00:01:13.680> obviously<00:01:13.860> came<00:01:14.340> there<00:01:14.580> and

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:14.610 
and then we got obviously came there and

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:17.570 
and then we got obviously came there and
the<00:01:14.939> 88<00:01:15.689> rated<00:01:16.229> Defoe<00:01:16.619> I<00:01:16.890> believe<00:01:17.310> that<00:01:17.430> it's

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:17.580 
the 88 rated Defoe I believe that it's

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:19.130 
the 88 rated Defoe I believe that it's
the<00:01:17.640> highest<00:01:17.880> rated<00:01:18.450> out<00:01:18.540> any<00:01:18.840> of<00:01:19.020> these

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:19.140 
the highest rated out any of these

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:21.499 
the highest rated out any of these
players<00:01:19.409> I<00:01:19.710> and<00:01:20.580> the<00:01:20.640> reason<00:01:20.759> for<00:01:21.000> that<00:01:21.270> is

00:01:21.499 --> 00:01:21.509 
players I and the reason for that is

00:01:21.509 --> 00:01:22.850 
players I and the reason for that is
because<00:01:21.570> he's<00:01:21.900> actually<00:01:22.049> had<00:01:22.290> two<00:01:22.530> previous

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:22.860 
because he's actually had two previous

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:25.899 
because he's actually had two previous
informs<00:01:23.790> and<00:01:24.060> so<00:01:24.810> it's<00:01:24.960> really<00:01:24.990> made<00:01:25.500> his

00:01:25.899 --> 00:01:25.909 
informs and so it's really made his

00:01:25.909 --> 00:01:28.789 
informs and so it's really made his
player<00:01:26.909> rating<00:01:27.390> was<00:01:27.720> super<00:01:28.110> high<00:01:28.259> and<00:01:28.560> eighty

00:01:28.789 --> 00:01:28.799 
player rating was super high and eighty

00:01:28.799 --> 00:01:30.499 
player rating was super high and eighty

don't don what are we gonna have in this

00:02:20.849 --> 00:02:22.580 
don't don what are we gonna have in this
one<00:02:21.150> we've<00:02:21.329> got<00:02:21.420> ourselves<00:02:21.659> always<00:02:22.409> at<00:02:22.560> a

00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:22.590 
one we've got ourselves always at a

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:26.330 
one we've got ourselves always at a
surrogate<00:02:23.180> a4<00:02:24.180> rate<00:02:24.389> but<00:02:24.689> still<00:02:25.019> a<00:02:25.290> poor<00:02:26.099> pack

00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:26.340 
surrogate a4 rate but still a poor pack

00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:28.309 
surrogate a4 rate but still a poor pack
and<00:02:26.519> it<00:02:26.609> looks<00:02:26.760> like<00:02:26.819> Daniel<00:02:27.420> Agger<00:02:27.810> could<00:02:28.079> be

00:02:28.309 --> 00:02:28.319 
and it looks like Daniel Agger could be

00:02:28.319 --> 00:02:30.289 
and it looks like Daniel Agger could be
on<00:02:28.409> his<00:02:28.439> way<00:02:28.590> out<00:02:28.769> of<00:02:28.920> Liverpool<00:02:29.639> this<00:02:29.849> season
