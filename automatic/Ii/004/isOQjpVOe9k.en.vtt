00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:08.760
 I present galaxy that blue is the new 

00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:10.639
 hybrid of samsung ahead is a 

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:13.799
 smartphone screen 4.8 inches 

00:00:10.639 --> 00:00:15.690
 super amoled hd and if we turn it over 

00:00:13.799 --> 00:00:18.630
 we have as if it were a camera 

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:20.640
 professional a sensor a lens of 10 

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:23.100
 increases and 20 megapixel layers 

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:25.769
 sensor bs and back side illumination for 

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:27.210
 take pictures with less luminosity and a 

00:00:25.769 --> 00:00:29.430
 flash of xenon that good then that we 

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:31.380
 allows to increase the flash power and 

00:00:29.430 --> 00:00:34.460
 make everything much more natural if we 

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:37.530
 we focus on the functions of the camera 

00:00:34.460 --> 00:00:39.000
 the interface that we currently have is 

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:40.769
 pretty simple where we can 

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:42.120
 configure shortcuts here and 

00:00:40.769 --> 00:00:46.190
 good the things in which we want 

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:49.229
 center is the zoom of 10 magnification of 

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:51.390
 photograph something that is worth it we can 

00:00:49.229 --> 00:00:53.750
 increase up to 10 times only with the 

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:53.750
 optical zoom 

00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:01.410
 and well, we do not have to need 

00:00:59.580 --> 00:01:02.580
 use that digital zoom to do the 

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:03.930
 photos that we would then have more 

00:01:02.580 --> 00:01:05.700
 grenades all this that we have here is 

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:08.340
 an optician who doing zoom magnifications 

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:09.420
 digital because really yes that is going to 

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:11.940
 distort a little but good 

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:14.300
 we know how we could see a photo 

00:01:11.940 --> 00:01:16.280
 that an object that was very far 

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:18.500
 another very interesting mode is the mode 

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:20.920
 prose and in which you are going to photograph 

00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:23.790
 an object a landscape what you want 

00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:25.640
 feeling for back 

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:28.410
 is pressing the shutter halfway 

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:31.020
 he is going to offer me a series of filters 

00:01:28.410 --> 00:01:32.850
 depending on what has been detected that 

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:37.410
 this object because maybe you think that 

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:39.660
 I want to praise the colors or good what 

00:01:37.410 --> 00:01:40.860
 we take this filter warm colors voucher 

00:01:39.660 --> 00:01:42.330
 we would make the photo that the effect that we 

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:44.640
 we hope in a landscape because maybe 

00:01:42.330 --> 00:01:46.680
 suggest us sunset or another kind of 

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:48.690
 filters so much of coluna is that I have 

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:51.240
 these pictures are worth before sharing 

00:01:48.690 --> 00:01:53.760
 we will go through our study 

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:55.979
 photographic where we will be able to edit 

00:01:53.760 --> 00:01:56.910
 the photos in a very simple way without 

00:01:55.979 --> 00:01:59.640
 need to load an application 

00:01:56.910 --> 00:02:01.130
 external is worth for example this same 

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:02.689
 Photo 

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:04.630
 ok, we have here all the 

00:02:02.689 --> 00:02:06.710
 options to edit them from 

00:02:04.630 --> 00:02:10.009
 crop them change is rotate size 

00:02:06.710 --> 00:02:12.560
 all the tone settings of 

00:02:10.009 --> 00:02:13.640
 change the contrasts those that edit 

00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:15.080
 The colors are worth a very 

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:17.510
 simple by simply sliding towards a 

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:19.130
 side to the other we will be able to play 

00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:21.560
 with these values ​​without needing to be 

00:02:19.130 --> 00:02:23.720
 a professional in him 

00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:25.700
 in this world it is worth then let's say the 

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:28.610
 live result and we will be able to 

00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:30.920
 well move as if we were 

00:02:28.610 --> 00:02:33.190
 Authentic professionals is worth here 

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:35.480
 we have all the different filters 

00:02:33.190 --> 00:02:37.190
 come many pre installed and we could 

00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:39.459
 even download manual everything in a way 

00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:39.459
 free 

00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:44.909
 if we want to make a collage of photos 

00:02:43.890 --> 00:02:46.830
 that is also very fashionable 

00:02:44.909 --> 00:02:49.260
 well, we could select 

00:02:46.830 --> 00:02:52.480
 different photos is worth so that the same 

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:53.500
 do not make us a collage 

00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:56.500
 randomly or that we 

00:02:53.500 --> 00:02:57.879
 let's be the ones that interact with this 

00:02:56.500 --> 00:03:01.239
 collage and we put it in the way that 

00:02:57.879 --> 00:03:03.430
 that we like the bigger edges 

00:03:01.239 --> 00:03:05.530
 smaller plus margin minus margin 

00:03:03.430 --> 00:03:06.670
 Once we have this photo, it is not 

00:03:05.530 --> 00:03:07.900
 we could share our beings 

00:03:06.670 --> 00:03:10.019
 dear ones or publish it where we 

00:03:07.900 --> 00:03:10.019
 we want
