rarely attached onto this thing you can

00:02:39.310 --> 00:02:41.009 
rarely attached onto this thing you can
easily<00:02:39.670> take<00:02:39.790> it<00:02:39.940> off<00:02:40.060> you<00:02:40.450> can<00:02:40.569> see<00:02:40.690> some<00:02:40.870> nice

00:02:41.009 --> 00:02:41.019 
easily take it off you can see some nice

00:02:41.019 --> 00:02:42.660 
easily take it off you can see some nice
little<00:02:41.260> grief<00:02:41.530> Lee<00:02:41.709> details<00:02:42.099> underneath

00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:42.670 
little grief Lee details underneath

00:02:42.670 --> 00:02:44.520 
little grief Lee details underneath
there<00:02:43.030> but<00:02:43.420> for<00:02:43.569> some<00:02:43.720> reason<00:02:44.019> they<00:02:44.109> randomly

00:02:44.520 --> 00:02:44.530 
there but for some reason they randomly

00:02:44.530 --> 00:02:46.080 
there but for some reason they randomly
just<00:02:44.739> cover<00:02:44.980> up<00:02:45.099> some<00:02:45.370> nice<00:02:45.489> details<00:02:45.879> maybe

00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:46.090 
just cover up some nice details maybe

00:02:46.090 --> 00:02:47.339 
just cover up some nice details maybe
that's<00:02:46.329> a<00:02:46.420> part<00:02:46.450> of<00:02:46.659> the<00:02:46.750> movie<00:02:47.019> maybe<00:02:47.170> they

00:02:47.339 --> 00:02:47.349 
that's a part of the movie maybe they

00:02:47.349 --> 00:02:49.830 
that's a part of the movie maybe they
like<00:02:47.470> do<00:02:47.620> repairs<00:02:48.040> on<00:02:48.250> this<00:02:48.849> specific<00:02:49.060> ship<00:02:49.599> or

00:02:49.830 --> 00:02:49.840 
like do repairs on this specific ship or

00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:51.030 
like do repairs on this specific ship or
something<00:02:50.170> but<00:02:50.319> I<00:02:50.470> really<00:02:50.709> just<00:02:50.950> don't

00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:51.040 
something but I really just don't

00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:52.920 
something but I really just don't
understand<00:02:51.579> that<00:02:51.700> at<00:02:51.849> all<00:02:51.970> you<00:02:52.569> can<00:02:52.690> see<00:02:52.810> the

00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:52.930 
understand that at all you can see the

00:02:52.930 --> 00:02:54.300 
understand that at all you can see the
back<00:02:53.139> of<00:02:53.349> the<00:02:53.440> escape<00:02:53.709> out<00:02:53.859> here<00:02:54.010> has<00:02:54.159> some

00:02:54.300 --> 00:02:54.310 
back of the escape out here has some

00:02:54.310 --> 00:02:55.710 
back of the escape out here has some
really<00:02:54.549> cool<00:02:54.760> looking<00:02:55.000> engines<00:02:55.389> I<00:02:55.480> kind<00:02:55.690> of

00:02:55.710 --> 00:02:55.720 
really cool looking engines I kind of

00:02:55.720 --> 00:02:56.789 
really cool looking engines I kind of
wish<00:02:55.870> I<00:02:55.959> chose<00:02:56.139> a<00:02:56.170> different<00:02:56.319> color<00:02:56.709> than

00:02:56.789 --> 00:02:56.799 
wish I chose a different color than

00:02:56.799 --> 00:02:58.530 
wish I chose a different color than
green<00:02:57.220> but<00:02:57.459> obviously<00:02:57.879> if<00:02:58.000> it's<00:02:58.120> accurate<00:02:58.329> to

00:02:58.530 --> 00:02:58.540 
green but obviously if it's accurate to

00:02:58.540 --> 00:03:00.210 
green but obviously if it's accurate to
the<00:02:58.599> movie<00:02:58.959> I<00:02:58.989> understand<00:02:59.440> why<00:02:59.620> and<00:02:59.920> they<00:03:00.159> do

00:03:00.210 --> 00:03:00.220 
the movie I understand why and they do

00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:01.979 
the movie I understand why and they do
look<00:03:00.459> really<00:03:00.609> cool<00:03:00.909> I'm<00:03:01.150> the<00:03:01.359> escape<00:03:01.629> pod<00:03:01.810> has

00:03:01.979 --> 00:03:01.989 
look really cool I'm the escape pod has

00:03:01.989 --> 00:03:03.539 
look really cool I'm the escape pod has
some<00:03:02.139> of<00:03:02.200> those<00:03:02.260> alien<00:03:02.739> conquest<00:03:03.069> guns<00:03:03.400> which

00:03:03.539 --> 00:03:03.549 
some of those alien conquest guns which

00:03:03.549 --> 00:03:05.430 
some of those alien conquest guns which
are<00:03:03.670> pretty<00:03:03.790> cool<00:03:04.030> a<00:03:04.269> problem<00:03:04.900> here<00:03:05.139> is<00:03:05.170> at<00:03:05.319> the

00:03:05.430 --> 00:03:05.440 
are pretty cool a problem here is at the

00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:06.809 
are pretty cool a problem here is at the
bottom<00:03:05.590> the<00:03:05.829> escape<00:03:06.069> pod<00:03:06.280> since<00:03:06.459> the<00:03:06.609> way<00:03:06.700> is

00:03:06.809 --> 00:03:06.819 
bottom the escape pod since the way is

00:03:06.819 --> 00:03:08.250 
bottom the escape pod since the way is
designed<00:03:07.180> it<00:03:07.329> actually<00:03:07.569> can't<00:03:07.780> really<00:03:07.989> stick

00:03:08.250 --> 00:03:08.260 
designed it actually can't really stick

00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:10.170 
designed it actually can't really stick
into<00:03:08.409> any<00:03:08.650> studs<00:03:09.010> unless<00:03:09.310> it's<00:03:09.489> only<00:03:09.760> about<00:03:09.849> 2

00:03:10.170 --> 00:03:10.180 
into any studs unless it's only about 2

00:03:10.180 --> 00:03:11.520 
into any studs unless it's only about 2
wide<00:03:10.450> so<00:03:10.930> that's<00:03:11.079> a<00:03:11.170> really<00:03:11.200> unfortunate

00:03:11.520 --> 00:03:11.530 
wide so that's a really unfortunate

00:03:11.530 --> 00:03:13.589 
wide so that's a really unfortunate
thing<00:03:12.159> the<00:03:12.549> cockpit<00:03:12.940> piece<00:03:13.090> for<00:03:13.239> the<00:03:13.329> set<00:03:13.510> is

00:03:13.589 --> 00:03:13.599 
thing the cockpit piece for the set is

00:03:13.599 --> 00:03:15.089 
thing the cockpit piece for the set is
that<00:03:13.750> really<00:03:13.959> nice<00:03:14.109> v<00:03:14.379> wing<00:03:14.799> better<00:03:14.980> you

00:03:15.089 --> 00:03:15.099 
that really nice v wing better you

00:03:15.099 --> 00:03:16.170 
that really nice v wing better you
can<00:03:15.190> actually<00:03:15.340> fold<00:03:15.700> down<00:03:15.909> you<00:03:16.030> can<00:03:16.150> see

00:03:16.170 --> 00:03:16.180 
can actually fold down you can see

00:03:16.180 --> 00:03:17.610 
can actually fold down you can see
there's<00:03:16.389> a<00:03:16.450> chair<00:03:16.659> inside<00:03:16.959> there<00:03:17.260> that<00:03:17.530> you

00:03:17.610 --> 00:03:17.620 
there's a chair inside there that you

00:03:17.620 --> 00:03:19.349 
there's a chair inside there that you
can<00:03:17.739> easily<00:03:17.980> stick<00:03:18.340> closely<00:03:18.609> on<00:03:18.940> and<00:03:19.090> the<00:03:19.150> cool

00:03:19.349 --> 00:03:19.359 
can easily stick closely on and the cool

00:03:19.359 --> 00:03:20.670 
can easily stick closely on and the cool
thing<00:03:19.389> is<00:03:19.599> actually<00:03:19.959> this<00:03:20.049> chair<00:03:20.319> moves<00:03:20.530> up

00:03:20.670 --> 00:03:20.680 
thing is actually this chair moves up

00:03:20.680 --> 00:03:21.960 
thing is actually this chair moves up
and<00:03:20.799> down<00:03:20.859> which<00:03:21.129> is<00:03:21.160> a<00:03:21.280> pretty<00:03:21.489> nice<00:03:21.699> little

00:03:21.960 --> 00:03:21.970 
and down which is a pretty nice little

00:03:21.970 --> 00:03:23.670 
and down which is a pretty nice little
feature<00:03:22.139> unfortunately<00:03:23.139> if<00:03:23.290> this<00:03:23.410> thing<00:03:23.590> is

00:03:23.670 --> 00:03:23.680 
feature unfortunately if this thing is

00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:25.559 
feature unfortunately if this thing is
coming<00:03:23.949> out<00:03:24.040> of<00:03:24.190> space<00:03:24.370> Lolan<00:03:24.849> is<00:03:25.030> going<00:03:25.419> to

00:03:25.559 --> 00:03:25.569 
coming out of space Lolan is going to

00:03:25.569 --> 00:03:27.390 
coming out of space Lolan is going to
die<00:03:25.780> because<00:03:25.810> of<00:03:26.260> some<00:03:26.530> giant<00:03:26.949> gaps<00:03:27.160> right

00:03:27.390 --> 00:03:27.400 
die because of some giant gaps right

00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:29.159 
die because of some giant gaps right
there<00:03:27.609> and<00:03:27.790> the<00:03:28.090> top<00:03:28.299> of<00:03:28.449> this<00:03:28.510> escape<00:03:28.840> pod<00:03:29.019> to

00:03:29.159 --> 00:03:29.169 
there and the top of this escape pod to

00:03:29.169 --> 00:03:30.720 
there and the top of this escape pod to
me<00:03:29.290> and<00:03:29.440> my<00:03:29.560> opinion<00:03:29.889> is<00:03:29.980> just<00:03:30.010> really<00:03:30.519> ugly

00:03:30.720 --> 00:03:30.730 
me and my opinion is just really ugly

00:03:30.730 --> 00:03:32.849 
me and my opinion is just really ugly
looks<00:03:31.090> jagged<00:03:31.569> and<00:03:31.690> strange<00:03:32.139> now<00:03:32.620> if<00:03:32.739> it's

00:03:32.849 --> 00:03:32.859 
looks jagged and strange now if it's

00:03:32.859 --> 00:03:34.020 
looks jagged and strange now if it's
accurate<00:03:33.040> understand<00:03:33.639> why<00:03:33.760> they<00:03:33.879> did<00:03:34.000> that

00:03:34.020 --> 00:03:34.030 
accurate understand why they did that

00:03:34.030 --> 00:03:35.849 
accurate understand why they did that
way<00:03:34.359> but<00:03:34.419> I'm<00:03:34.720> my<00:03:34.989> personal<00:03:35.440> opinion<00:03:35.709> it's

00:03:35.849 --> 00:03:35.859 
way but I'm my personal opinion it's

00:03:35.859 --> 00:03:37.470 
way but I'm my personal opinion it's
just<00:03:35.980> really<00:03:36.129> ugly<00:03:36.400> the<00:03:36.849> second<00:03:37.150> part<00:03:37.359> of<00:03:37.389> the

00:03:37.470 --> 00:03:37.480 
just really ugly the second part of the

00:03:37.480 --> 00:03:38.670 
just really ugly the second part of the
set<00:03:37.629> here<00:03:37.840> actually<00:03:38.019> do<00:03:38.230> like<00:03:38.410> a<00:03:38.440> lot<00:03:38.650> more

00:03:38.670 --> 00:03:38.680 
set here actually do like a lot more

00:03:38.680 --> 00:03:40.170 
set here actually do like a lot more
than<00:03:39.040> the<00:03:39.129> escape<00:03:39.430> but<00:03:39.609> it's<00:03:39.639> not<00:03:39.879> great<00:03:40.150> but

00:03:40.170 --> 00:03:40.180 
than the escape but it's not great but

00:03:40.180 --> 00:03:41.879 
than the escape but it's not great but
it's<00:03:40.329> cool<00:03:40.599> little<00:03:40.870> tiny<00:03:41.199> base<00:03:41.560> which<00:03:41.859> is

00:03:41.879 --> 00:03:41.889 
it's cool little tiny base which is

00:03:41.889 --> 00:03:43.890 
it's cool little tiny base which is
pretty<00:03:42.160> decent<00:03:42.370> see<00:03:43.030> some<00:03:43.239> cool<00:03:43.449> details

00:03:51.819 --> 00:03:53.879 
walkway right here which I guess is what
I'm<00:03:52.180> assuming<00:03:52.510> is<00:03:52.780> how<00:03:52.989> they<00:03:53.169> get<00:03:53.379> into<00:03:53.769> the

00:03:53.879 --> 00:03:53.889 
I'm assuming is how they get into the

00:03:53.889 --> 00:03:55.349 
I'm assuming is how they get into the
escape<00:03:54.160> pods<00:03:54.370> you<00:03:54.579> could<00:03:54.699> put<00:03:54.819> the<00:03:54.910> escape<00:03:55.180> out

00:03:55.349 --> 00:03:55.359 
escape pods you could put the escape out

00:03:55.359 --> 00:03:56.520 
escape pods you could put the escape out
in<00:03:55.449> front<00:03:55.599> of<00:03:55.690> it<00:03:55.780> like<00:03:55.900> that<00:03:55.930> which<00:03:56.230> is<00:03:56.260> kind

00:03:56.520 --> 00:03:56.530 
in front of it like that which is kind

00:03:56.530 --> 00:03:58.379 
in front of it like that which is kind
of<00:03:56.560> cool<00:03:56.620> it's<00:03:57.280> a<00:03:57.340> small<00:03:57.669> little<00:03:57.699> area<00:03:58.120> we<00:03:58.239> can

00:03:58.379 --> 00:03:58.389 
of cool it's a small little area we can

00:03:58.389 --> 00:03:59.759 
of cool it's a small little area we can
definitely<00:03:58.569> stand<00:03:58.930> a<00:03:59.079> minifigure<00:03:59.470> and<00:03:59.620> if<00:03:59.680> i

00:03:59.759 --> 00:03:59.769 
definitely stand a minifigure and if i

00:03:59.769 --> 00:04:00.780 
definitely stand a minifigure and if i
zoom<00:03:59.799> in<00:04:00.129> right<00:04:00.280> here<00:04:00.489> you<00:04:00.549> can<00:04:00.639> see<00:04:00.760> that

00:04:00.780 --> 00:04:00.790 
zoom in right here you can see that

00:04:00.790 --> 00:04:02.369 
zoom in right here you can see that
sticker<00:04:01.209> which<00:04:01.419> is<00:04:01.569> really<00:04:01.780> cool<00:04:01.989> has<00:04:02.230> the

00:04:02.369 --> 00:04:02.379 
sticker which is really cool has the

00:04:02.379 --> 00:04:03.780 
sticker which is really cool has the
escape<00:04:02.680> pod<00:04:02.889> on<00:04:03.010> it<00:04:03.129> which<00:04:03.220> I'm<00:04:03.340> assuming<00:04:03.489> is

00:04:03.780 --> 00:04:03.790 
escape pod on it which I'm assuming is

00:04:03.790 --> 00:04:05.159 
escape pod on it which I'm assuming is
like<00:04:03.909> the<00:04:04.000> controls<00:04:04.419> to<00:04:04.540> launch<00:04:04.810> the<00:04:04.959> escape

00:04:05.159 --> 00:04:05.169 
like the controls to launch the escape

00:04:05.169 --> 00:04:07.020 
like the controls to launch the escape
pod<00:04:05.319> so<00:04:05.409> that's<00:04:05.590> pretty<00:04:05.769> nice<00:04:05.949> the<00:04:06.579> gray<00:04:06.790> piece

00:04:07.020 --> 00:04:07.030 
pod so that's pretty nice the gray piece

00:04:07.030 --> 00:04:07.979 
pod so that's pretty nice the gray piece
right<00:04:07.209> here<00:04:07.239> is<00:04:07.419> actually<00:04:07.510> one<00:04:07.870> of<00:04:07.900> my

00:04:07.979 --> 00:04:07.989 
right here is actually one of my

00:04:07.989 --> 00:04:09.390 
right here is actually one of my
favorite<00:04:08.349> parts<00:04:08.560> about<00:04:08.590> the<00:04:08.769> set<00:04:08.919> this<00:04:09.010> is<00:04:09.220> a

00:04:09.390 --> 00:04:09.400 
favorite parts about the set this is a

00:04:09.400 --> 00:04:11.069 
favorite parts about the set this is a
door<00:04:09.790> which<00:04:10.030> is<00:04:10.150> a<00:04:10.180> pretty<00:04:10.510> cool<00:04:10.780> feature

00:04:11.069 --> 00:04:11.079 
door which is a pretty cool feature

00:04:11.079 --> 00:04:12.750 
door which is a pretty cool feature
actually<00:04:11.680> the<00:04:11.919> door<00:04:12.099> if<00:04:12.250> you<00:04:12.340> basically<00:04:12.609> you

00:04:12.750 --> 00:04:12.760 
actually the door if you basically you

00:04:12.760 --> 00:04:14.399 
actually the door if you basically you
just<00:04:12.819> push<00:04:13.120> it<00:04:13.150> it<00:04:13.419> does<00:04:13.659> open<00:04:13.870> which<00:04:14.290> is

00:04:14.399 --> 00:04:14.409 
just push it it does open which is

00:04:14.409 --> 00:04:16.170 
just push it it does open which is
really<00:04:14.829> really<00:04:15.040> nice<00:04:15.280> there's<00:04:15.849> a<00:04:15.909> look<00:04:16.030> at<00:04:16.120> the

00:04:16.170 --> 00:04:16.180 
really really nice there's a look at the

00:04:16.180 --> 00:04:17.610 
really really nice there's a look at the
door<00:04:16.359> from<00:04:16.570> the<00:04:16.659> back<00:04:16.840> unfortunately<00:04:17.079> it's

00:04:17.610 --> 00:04:17.620 
door from the back unfortunately it's

00:04:17.620 --> 00:04:19.529 
door from the back unfortunately it's
not<00:04:17.650> a<00:04:17.739> very<00:04:18.039> big<00:04:18.099> walkway<00:04:18.579> and<00:04:18.820> it's<00:04:19.030> kind<00:04:19.479> of

00:04:19.529 --> 00:04:19.539 
not a very big walkway and it's kind of

00:04:19.539 --> 00:04:21.209 
not a very big walkway and it's kind of
a<00:04:19.810> tight<00:04:20.109> fit<00:04:20.409> for<00:04:20.590> general<00:04:20.829> zod<00:04:20.979> to<00:04:21.099> get

00:04:21.209 --> 00:04:21.219 
a tight fit for general zod to get

00:04:21.219 --> 00:04:22.409 
a tight fit for general zod to get
through<00:04:21.400> that<00:04:21.489> but<00:04:21.700> it's<00:04:21.820> still<00:04:21.940> pretty<00:04:22.120> cool

00:04:22.409 --> 00:04:22.419 
through that but it's still pretty cool

00:04:22.419 --> 00:04:24.029 
through that but it's still pretty cool
the<00:04:22.870> last<00:04:23.110> part<00:04:23.260> about<00:04:23.409> that's<00:04:23.530> it<00:04:23.710> is<00:04:23.860> the

00:04:24.029 --> 00:04:24.039 
the last part about that's it is the

00:04:24.039 --> 00:04:25.500 
the last part about that's it is the
flick<00:04:24.250> fire<00:04:24.430> missiles<00:04:24.760> which<00:04:24.880> they<00:04:25.090> did<00:04:25.240> puts

00:04:25.500 --> 00:04:25.510 
flick fire missiles which they did puts

00:04:25.510 --> 00:04:26.340 
flick fire missiles which they did puts
a<00:04:25.659> little<00:04:25.840> bit<00:04:26.050> more

00:04:26.340 --> 00:04:26.350 
a little bit more

00:04:26.350 --> 00:04:28.200 
a little bit more
effort<00:04:26.620> into<00:04:26.920> which<00:04:27.100> I<00:04:27.220> do<00:04:27.280> appreciate<00:04:27.640> kinda

00:04:28.200 --> 00:04:28.210 
effort into which I do appreciate kinda

00:04:28.210 --> 00:04:29.940 
effort into which I do appreciate kinda
like<00:04:28.360> the<00:04:28.480> iron<00:04:28.660> man<00:04:28.960> 3<00:04:29.230> seaport<00:04:29.620> battle<00:04:29.860> it's

00:04:29.940 --> 00:04:29.950 
like the iron man 3 seaport battle it's

00:04:29.950 --> 00:04:31.410 
like the iron man 3 seaport battle it's
not<00:04:30.100> as<00:04:30.220> good<00:04:30.370> as<00:04:30.490> that<00:04:30.520> but<00:04:31.090> it<00:04:31.150> is<00:04:31.240> pretty

00:04:31.410 --> 00:04:31.420 
not as good as that but it is pretty

00:04:31.420 --> 00:04:33.270 
not as good as that but it is pretty
cool<00:04:31.660> basically<00:04:32.230> what<00:04:32.380> you<00:04:32.500> do<00:04:32.650> if<00:04:32.890> you<00:04:33.010> pull

00:04:33.270 --> 00:04:33.280 
cool basically what you do if you pull

00:04:33.280 --> 00:04:35.100 
cool basically what you do if you pull
on<00:04:33.490> this<00:04:33.850> piece<00:04:34.120> right<00:04:34.240> back<00:04:34.570> here<00:04:34.840> it<00:04:34.960> has<00:04:35.080> a

00:04:35.100 --> 00:04:35.110 
on this piece right back here it has a

00:04:35.110 --> 00:04:36.360 
on this piece right back here it has a
little<00:04:35.230> rubber<00:04:35.470> piece<00:04:35.710> and<00:04:35.890> you<00:04:35.950> pull<00:04:36.130> on<00:04:36.160> that

00:04:36.360 --> 00:04:36.370 
little rubber piece and you pull on that

00:04:36.370 --> 00:04:38.010 
little rubber piece and you pull on that
it<00:04:36.760> will<00:04:36.940> launch<00:04:37.090> the<00:04:37.240> missiles<00:04:37.600> pretty<00:04:37.810> well

00:04:38.010 --> 00:04:38.020 
it will launch the missiles pretty well

00:04:38.020 --> 00:04:39.020 
it will launch the missiles pretty well
which<00:04:38.140> is<00:04:38.260> a<00:04:38.290> nice<00:04:38.440> little<00:04:38.620> feature

00:04:39.020 --> 00:04:39.030 
which is a nice little feature

00:04:39.030 --> 00:04:41.250 
which is a nice little feature
unfortunately<00:04:40.030> there<00:04:40.210> they<00:04:40.330> use<00:04:40.510> the<00:04:40.780> hero

00:04:41.250 --> 00:04:41.260 
unfortunately there they use the hero

00:04:41.260 --> 00:04:43.890 
unfortunately there they use the hero
factory<00:04:41.500> size<00:04:41.860> bionicle<00:04:42.490> pins<00:04:42.790> as<00:04:43.030> the<00:04:43.630> actual

00:04:43.890 --> 00:04:43.900 
factory size bionicle pins as the actual

00:04:43.900 --> 00:04:45.660 
factory size bionicle pins as the actual
missile<00:04:44.140> tops<00:04:44.500> so<00:04:44.920> that's<00:04:45.100> not<00:04:45.310> a<00:04:45.370> very<00:04:45.550> good

00:04:45.660 --> 00:04:45.670 
missile tops so that's not a very good

00:04:45.670 --> 00:04:47.160 
missile tops so that's not a very good
thing<00:04:45.880> because<00:04:46.090> if<00:04:46.450> this<00:04:46.570> thing<00:04:46.780> flips<00:04:47.020> upside

00:04:47.160 --> 00:04:47.170 
thing because if this thing flips upside

00:04:47.170 --> 00:04:48.390 
thing because if this thing flips upside
down<00:04:47.410> the<00:04:47.560> missiles<00:04:47.830> will<00:04:47.980> just<00:04:48.190> fall<00:04:48.370> out

00:04:48.390 --> 00:04:48.400 
down the missiles will just fall out

00:04:48.400 --> 00:04:49.770 
down the missiles will just fall out
which<00:04:48.670> is<00:04:48.790> kind<00:04:48.970> of<00:04:49.000> unfortunate<00:04:49.150> i<00:04:49.630> wish

00:04:49.770 --> 00:04:49.780 
which is kind of unfortunate i wish

00:04:49.780 --> 00:04:50.790 
which is kind of unfortunate i wish
they'd<00:04:49.930> use<00:04:50.080> use<00:04:50.230> the<00:04:50.320> non<00:04:50.470> flow<00:04:50.650> fire

00:04:50.790 --> 00:04:50.800 
they'd use use the non flow fire

00:04:50.800 --> 00:04:51.930 
they'd use use the non flow fire
missiles<00:04:51.100> but<00:04:51.190> it<00:04:51.310> probably<00:04:51.520> wouldn't<00:04:51.790> have

00:04:51.930 --> 00:04:51.940 
missiles but it probably wouldn't have

00:04:51.940 --> 00:04:53.400 
missiles but it probably wouldn't have
worked<00:04:52.120> as<00:04:52.300> well<00:04:52.450> if<00:04:52.630> they<00:04:52.750> use<00:04:53.020> those<00:04:53.230> pieces

00:04:53.400 --> 00:04:53.410 
worked as well if they use those pieces

00:04:53.410 --> 00:04:54.960 
worked as well if they use those pieces
compared<00:04:53.920> to<00:04:54.010> these<00:04:54.130> ones<00:04:54.430> but<00:04:54.730> it's<00:04:54.880> still

00:04:54.960 --> 00:04:54.970 
compared to these ones but it's still

00:04:54.970 --> 00:04:56.730 
compared to these ones but it's still
pretty<00:04:55.030> cool<00:04:55.450> alright<00:04:55.720> guys<00:04:55.870> followers<00:04:56.470> here

on the black zero escape this is a
pretty<00:04:58.690> okay<00:04:59.350> mana<00:04:59.950> steel<00:05:00.310> said<00:05:00.550> i<00:05:00.730> like<00:05:00.940> half

00:05:01.200 --> 00:05:01.210 
pretty okay mana steel said i like half

00:05:01.210 --> 00:05:02.820 
pretty okay mana steel said i like half
of<00:05:01.360> it<00:05:01.510> i<00:05:01.600> really<00:05:01.930> like<00:05:02.080> the<00:05:02.170> superman<00:05:02.500> figure
