00:01:57.200 --> 00:01:57.210 
skin like the rind of an orange so

00:01:57.210 --> 00:01:58.969 
skin like the rind of an orange so
there's<00:01:57.360> always<00:01:57.569> that<00:01:57.720> that<00:01:58.080> element<00:01:58.560> of<00:01:58.619> you

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:00.810 
are not alone in this moment that we're

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:02.990 
are not alone in this moment that we're
all<00:02:00.960> participating<00:02:01.740> in<00:02:01.800> community<00:02:02.000> together

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:07.309 
all participating in community together
here<00:02:03.569> right<00:02:03.840> now<00:02:04.080> I<00:02:05.899> think<00:02:06.899> that<00:02:07.020> when<00:02:07.170> the

00:02:07.309 --> 00:02:07.319 
here right now I think that when the

00:02:07.319 --> 00:02:09.919 
here right now I think that when the
audience<00:02:07.770> is<00:02:08.190> able<00:02:08.729> to<00:02:09.060> recognize<00:02:09.630> something

00:02:09.919 --> 00:02:09.929 
audience is able to recognize something

00:02:09.929 --> 00:02:11.990 
audience is able to recognize something
in<00:02:10.200> your<00:02:10.440> work<00:02:10.710> within<00:02:11.039> their<00:02:11.310> own<00:02:11.490> lives<00:02:11.760> it

00:02:11.990 --> 00:02:12.000 
in your work within their own lives it

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:13.910 
in your work within their own lives it
creates<00:02:12.300> a<00:02:12.390> conversation<00:02:13.230> they've<00:02:13.650> been

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:13.920 
creates a conversation they've been
