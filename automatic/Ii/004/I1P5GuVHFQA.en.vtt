than<00:01:37.619> the<00:01:37.770> pieces<00:01:38.579> that<00:01:38.729> were<00:01:38.909> welding<00:01:40.100> now

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:41.100 
than the pieces that were welding now

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:43.130 
than the pieces that were welding now
we'll<00:01:41.310> start<00:01:41.549> by<00:01:41.700> putting<00:01:41.909> a<00:01:42.270> tack<00:01:42.570> weld<00:01:42.899> on

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:43.140 
we'll start by putting a tack weld on

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:49.580 
we'll start by putting a tack weld on
each<00:01:43.560> corner<00:01:47.869> next<00:01:48.869> we're<00:01:49.140> going<00:01:49.259> to<00:01:49.350> go<00:01:49.470> ahead

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:49.590 
each corner next we're going to go ahead

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:52.010 
each corner next we're going to go ahead
and<00:01:49.890> tack<00:01:50.100> these<00:01:50.310> pieces<00:01:50.640> together<00:01:51.020> I've

00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:52.020 
and tack these pieces together I've

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:54.139 
and tack these pieces together I've
decided<00:01:52.380> to<00:01:52.530> use<00:01:52.710> a<00:01:52.740> sixty<00:01:53.250> ten<00:01:53.490> electrode<00:01:54.000> to

00:01:54.139 --> 00:01:54.149 
decided to use a sixty ten electrode to

00:01:54.149 --> 00:01:57.620 
decided to use a sixty ten electrode to
tack<00:01:54.390> these<00:01:54.930> pieces<00:01:55.320> up<00:01:55.740> because<00:01:56.460> they<00:01:56.790> tend

00:01:57.620 --> 00:01:57.630 
tack these pieces up because they tend

00:01:57.630 --> 00:02:00.649 
tack these pieces up because they tend
to<00:01:57.829> burn<00:01:58.829> a<00:01:58.890> little<00:01:59.070> bit<00:01:59.310> quicker<00:01:59.549> and<00:01:59.820> start<00:02:00.630> a

00:02:00.649 --> 00:02:00.659 
to burn a little bit quicker and start a

00:02:00.659 --> 00:02:39.920 
to burn a little bit quicker and start a
little<00:02:00.780> bit<00:02:00.990> easier

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:39.930 

00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:41.880

after tacking your pieces together
you're<00:02:42.490> going<00:02:42.670> to<00:02:42.760> want<00:02:42.940> to<00:02:43.000> go<00:02:43.150> ahead<00:02:43.270> and

00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:43.480 
you're going to want to go ahead and

00:02:43.480 --> 00:02:47.100 
you're going to want to go ahead and
remove<00:02:43.600> the<00:02:43.900> slag<00:02:44.850> from<00:02:45.850> the<00:02:46.000> tak<00:02:46.210> loads<00:02:46.480> so

00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:47.110 
remove the slag from the tak loads so

00:02:47.110 --> 00:02:49.770 
remove the slag from the tak loads so
that<00:02:47.260> they<00:02:47.380> don't<00:02:47.530> become<00:02:48.030> entrapped<00:02:49.030> in<00:02:49.300> the

00:02:49.770 --> 00:02:49.780 
that they don't become entrapped in the
