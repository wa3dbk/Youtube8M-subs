classic defenses that there is what I
mean<00:00:45.090> by<00:00:45.149> classic<00:00:45.809> is<00:00:46.020> based<00:00:46.530> on<00:00:47.210> very<00:00:48.260> general

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:49.260 
mean by classic is based on very general

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:53.209

and<00:00:50.149> proven<00:00:51.149> opening<00:00:51.840> principles<00:00:52.410> things

00:00:53.209 --> 00:00:53.219 
and proven opening principles things

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:56.779 
and proven opening principles things
like<00:00:53.750> controlling<00:00:54.750> the<00:00:55.110> center<00:00:55.789> developing

00:00:56.779 --> 00:00:56.789 
like controlling the center developing

00:00:56.789 --> 00:00:59.139 
like controlling the center developing
pieces<00:00:57.329> quickly<00:00:57.840> and<00:00:58.079> efficiently<00:00:58.530> and

00:00:59.139 --> 00:00:59.149 
pieces quickly and efficiently and

00:00:59.149 --> 00:01:02.240 
pieces quickly and efficiently and
castling<00:01:00.149> as<00:01:00.329> soon<00:01:00.539> as<00:01:00.750> possible<00:01:01.320> so<00:01:02.100> why

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:02.250 
castling as soon as possible so why

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:04.070 
castling as soon as possible so why
should<00:01:02.520> also<00:01:02.730> be<00:01:03.090> developing<00:01:03.660> their<00:01:03.840> pieces

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:04.080 
should also be developing their pieces

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:10.880 
should also be developing their pieces
in<00:01:04.530> the<00:01:04.650> center<00:01:04.860> and<00:01:05.960> Bishop<00:01:06.960> e7<00:01:09.619> now<00:01:10.619> Bishop

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:10.890 
in the center and Bishop e7 now Bishop

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:13.550 
in the center and Bishop e7 now Bishop
g5<00:01:11.490> it's<00:01:12.330> important<00:01:12.869> for<00:01:12.990> white<00:01:13.170> to<00:01:13.380> play

00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:13.560 
g5 it's important for white to play

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:16.760 
g5 it's important for white to play
Bishop<00:01:14.159> g5<00:01:14.490> before<00:01:15.090> he<00:01:15.210> plays<00:01:15.450> III<00:01:16.020> said<00:01:16.650> he

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:16.770 
Bishop g5 before he plays III said he

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:21.200 
Bishop g5 before he plays III said he
doesn't<00:01:16.979> block<00:01:17.310> his<00:01:17.580> Bishop<00:01:17.939> in<00:01:18.530> castles<00:01:20.210> III

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:21.210 
doesn't block his Bishop in castles III

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:26.840 
doesn't block his Bishop in castles III
and<00:01:22.110> now<00:01:22.619> h6<00:01:24.680> this<00:01:25.680> is<00:01:25.890> an<00:01:26.100> important<00:01:26.670> move

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:26.850 
and now h6 this is an important move

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:30.319 
and now h6 this is an important move
because<00:01:27.420> it's<00:01:28.290> what<00:01:28.560> we<00:01:28.799> call<00:01:29.150> putting<00:01:30.150> a

00:01:30.319 --> 00:01:30.329 
because it's what we call putting a

00:01:30.329 --> 00:01:32.990 
because it's what we call putting a
question<00:01:30.840> to<00:01:31.020> the<00:01:31.170> bishop<00:01:31.560> now<00:01:32.430> White<00:01:32.700> has<00:01:32.729> to

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:33.000 
question to the bishop now White has to

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:33.770 
question to the bishop now White has to
make<00:01:33.150> a<00:01:33.180> decision

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:33.780 
make a decision

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:36.740 
make a decision
he<00:01:34.560> either<00:01:34.710> gives<00:01:35.220> this<00:01:35.369> bishop<00:01:35.759> up<00:01:35.909> and<00:01:36.180> takes

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:36.750 
he either gives this bishop up and takes

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:39.020 
he either gives this bishop up and takes
your<00:01:36.960> knight<00:01:37.170> he<00:01:37.799> moves<00:01:38.040> his<00:01:38.159> Bishop<00:01:38.549> back<00:01:38.790> to

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:39.030 
your knight he moves his Bishop back to

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:40.819 
your knight he moves his Bishop back to
f4<00:01:39.479> which<00:01:39.720> means<00:01:39.960> that<00:01:40.170> there's<00:01:40.439> no<00:01:40.590> longer

00:01:40.819 --> 00:01:40.829 
f4 which means that there's no longer

00:01:40.829 --> 00:01:44.480 
f4 which means that there's no longer
this<00:01:41.070> pressure<00:01:41.400> here<00:01:41.579> on<00:01:41.790> g5<00:01:42.329> or<00:01:43.310> the<00:01:44.310> bishop

00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:44.490 
this pressure here on g5 or the bishop

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:47.630 
this pressure here on g5 or the bishop
goes<00:01:44.880> back<00:01:45.119> to<00:01:45.390> h4<00:01:45.930> which<00:01:46.560> means<00:01:46.920> that<00:01:47.250> the

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:47.640 
goes back to h4 which means that the

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:50.179 
goes back to h4 which means that the
bishop<00:01:47.970> can<00:01:48.119> never<00:01:48.390> return<00:01:48.689> on<00:01:49.259> this<00:01:49.799> diagonal

00:01:50.179 --> 00:01:50.189 
bishop can never return on this diagonal

00:01:50.189 --> 00:01:52.760 
bishop can never return on this diagonal
so<00:01:50.850> after<00:01:51.090> Bishop<00:01:51.240> h4<00:01:51.869> I<00:01:51.899> think<00:01:52.259> black<00:01:52.470> can

00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:52.770 
so after Bishop h4 I think black can

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:57.410 
so after Bishop h4 I think black can
play<00:01:52.799> b6<00:01:54.829> there's<00:01:55.829> another<00:01:56.159> move<00:01:56.460> here<00:01:56.729> 94

00:01:57.410 --> 00:01:57.420 
play b6 there's another move here 94

00:01:57.420 --> 00:02:00.440 
play b6 there's another move here 94
this<00:01:57.990> is<00:01:58.170> known<00:01:58.350> as<00:01:58.380> the<00:01:58.740> Alaska<00:01:59.399> defense<00:02:00.149> of

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:00.450 
this is known as the Alaska defense of

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:03.469 
this is known as the Alaska defense of
the<00:02:00.689> Queens<00:02:00.990> gambit<00:02:01.380> declined<00:02:01.530> and<00:02:02.479> basically

00:02:03.469 --> 00:02:03.479 
the Queens gambit declined and basically

00:02:03.479 --> 00:02:06.230 
the Queens gambit declined and basically
black<00:02:03.899> in<00:02:04.200> trade<00:02:04.950> some<00:02:05.189> pieces<00:02:05.430> right<00:02:05.909> away

00:02:06.230 --> 00:02:06.240 
black in trade some pieces right away

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:10.100 
black in trade some pieces right away
something<00:02:06.810> like<00:02:06.990> Bishop<00:02:07.500> e7<00:02:07.860> Queen<00:02:08.429> e7<00:02:09.110> Rick

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:13.860 
c1 c6 and this variation is

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:16.430 
c1 c6 and this variation is
very<00:02:14.040> solid<00:02:14.370> for<00:02:14.760> black<00:02:15.000> he's<00:02:15.780> going<00:02:16.110> to<00:02:16.230> play

00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:16.440 
very solid for black he's going to play

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:20.840 
very solid for black he's going to play
97<00:02:17.360> b6<00:02:18.360> there<00:02:19.080> should<00:02:19.260> be<00:02:19.410> seven<00:02:19.710> at<00:02:20.040> some

on c3 he'll play rook C a rook d8 and
he'll<00:02:27.480> play<00:02:27.690> for<00:02:27.780> the<00:02:28.170> c5<00:02:28.680> break<00:02:29.040> which<00:02:30.000> as

00:02:30.290 --> 00:02:30.300 
he'll play for the c5 break which as

00:02:30.300 --> 00:02:33.440 
he'll play for the c5 break which as
you'll<00:02:30.480> see<00:02:30.720> later<00:02:30.750> on<00:02:31.230> is<00:02:31.410> very<00:02:31.650> common<00:02:32.450> the

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:33.450 
you'll see later on is very common the

00:02:33.450 --> 00:02:35.330 
you'll see later on is very common the
other<00:02:33.600> option<00:02:34.080> here<00:02:34.230> for<00:02:34.440> black<00:02:34.650> which<00:02:34.920> is<00:02:35.130> I

00:02:35.330 --> 00:02:35.340 
other option here for black which is I

00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:40.699 
other option here for black which is I
think<00:02:35.880> slightly<00:02:36.720> more<00:02:36.960> popular<00:02:37.650> is<00:02:38.360> b6<00:02:39.360> and<00:02:39.780> I

00:02:40.699 --> 00:02:40.709 
think slightly more popular is b6 and I

00:02:40.709 --> 00:02:42.290 
think slightly more popular is b6 and I
think<00:02:40.920> the<00:02:41.040> reason<00:02:41.340> this<00:02:41.430> is<00:02:41.490> more<00:02:41.790> popular<00:02:42.240> is

00:02:42.290 --> 00:02:42.300 
think the reason this is more popular is

00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:44.330 
think the reason this is more popular is
because<00:02:42.390> you<00:02:42.810> don't<00:02:42.900> trade<00:02:43.260> so<00:02:43.890> many<00:02:44.070> pieces

00:02:44.330 --> 00:02:44.340 
because you don't trade so many pieces

00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:46.670 
because you don't trade so many pieces
right<00:02:44.760> away<00:02:45.060> which<00:02:45.660> usually<00:02:45.870> makes<00:02:46.260> the<00:02:46.440> game

00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:46.680 
right away which usually makes the game

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:49.760 
right away which usually makes the game
more<00:02:46.890> interesting<00:02:48.050> both<00:02:49.050> lines<00:02:49.380> are<00:02:49.560> very

00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:49.770 
more interesting both lines are very

00:02:49.770 --> 00:02:52.670 
more interesting both lines are very
solid<00:02:50.070> for<00:02:50.400> black<00:02:50.640> what<00:02:51.030> that<00:02:51.209> means<00:02:51.450> is<00:02:51.870> why

00:02:52.670 --> 00:02:52.680 
solid for black what that means is why

00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:55.160 
solid for black what that means is why
it's<00:02:52.860> going<00:02:53.010> to<00:02:53.190> have<00:02:53.340> to<00:02:53.550> take<00:02:54.209> a<00:02:54.270> lot<00:02:54.660> of<00:02:54.840> risk

00:02:55.160 --> 00:02:55.170 
it's going to have to take a lot of risk

00:02:55.170 --> 00:02:57.890 
it's going to have to take a lot of risk
and<00:02:55.560> when<00:02:56.400> white<00:02:56.610> creates<00:02:57.090> risk<00:02:57.390> that<00:02:57.630> means

00:02:57.890 --> 00:02:57.900 
and when white creates risk that means

00:02:57.900 --> 00:03:02.420 
and when white creates risk that means
black<00:02:58.290> gets<00:02:58.560> winning<00:02:58.830> chances<00:02:59.070> to<00:03:00.560> Lefter<00:03:01.560> b6y

00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:02.430 
black gets winning chances to Lefter b6y

black gets winning chances to Lefter b6y

castles and now black can take on c4
it's<00:03:14.580> important<00:03:15.150> that<00:03:15.180> you<00:03:15.570> don't<00:03:15.870> take<00:03:16.170> on<00:03:16.320> c4

00:03:17.199 --> 00:03:17.209 
it's important that you don't take on c4

00:03:17.209 --> 00:03:19.820 
it's important that you don't take on c4
before<00:03:18.209> white<00:03:18.600> developed<00:03:19.200> suspicions

before white developed suspicions

because<00:03:20.549> that<00:03:20.790> would<00:03:20.940> be<00:03:21.060> wasting<00:03:21.450> time<00:03:21.590> after

his bishop once and then if you take on
c4<00:03:28.019> that<00:03:28.290> means<00:03:29.220> why<00:03:29.370> does<00:03:29.519> the<00:03:29.640> move<00:03:29.790> his

00:03:29.900 --> 00:03:29.910

c4 that means why does the move his
Bishop<00:03:30.239> again<00:03:30.540> to<00:03:30.720> recapture<00:03:31.170> the<00:03:31.440> pawn<00:03:31.650> and

Bishop again to recapture the pawn and

Bishop again to recapture the pawn and
the<00:03:34.290> point<00:03:34.590> of<00:03:34.650> taking<00:03:34.830> on<00:03:35.100> c4<00:03:35.519> is<00:03:35.670> now<00:03:35.850> our

00:03:35.990 --> 00:03:36.000 
the point of taking on c4 is now our

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:39.020 
the point of taking on c4 is now our
bishop<00:03:36.360> has<00:03:36.540> this<00:03:36.870> great<00:03:37.200> diagonal<00:03:37.860> and<00:03:38.070> black

to play c5 next and challenge white
centre-right<00:03:46.500> then<00:03:46.739> you<00:03:46.830> can<00:03:47.010> support<00:03:47.400> this

00:03:47.630 --> 00:03:47.640 
centre-right then you can support this

00:03:47.640 --> 00:03:51.350 
centre-right then you can support this
with<00:03:47.910> moves<00:03:48.150> like<00:03:48.269> rook<00:03:48.630> c8<00:03:48.900> Queen<00:03:49.860> c7<00:03:50.360> bring
