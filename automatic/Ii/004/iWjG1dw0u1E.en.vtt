okay<00:00:04.020> the<00:00:04.169> first<00:00:04.350> thing<00:00:04.620> we're<00:00:04.770> gonna<00:00:04.859> do<00:00:05.129> is

00:00:05.780 --> 00:00:05.790 
okay the first thing we're gonna do is

00:00:05.790 --> 00:00:09.320 
okay the first thing we're gonna do is
we<00:00:06.209> are<00:00:06.240> gonna<00:00:06.540> focus<00:00:06.930> in<00:00:07.410> on<00:00:08.040> kind<00:00:08.969> of<00:00:09.120> some

00:00:09.320 --> 00:00:09.330 
we are gonna focus in on kind of some

00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:11.450 
we are gonna focus in on kind of some
backwards<00:00:09.900> type<00:00:10.230> problems<00:00:10.710> I'm<00:00:11.219> going<00:00:11.400> to

00:00:11.450 --> 00:00:11.460 
backwards type problems I'm going to

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:12.890 
backwards type problems I'm going to
give<00:00:11.610> you<00:00:11.730> information<00:00:11.940> that<00:00:12.480> we<00:00:12.660> have<00:00:12.809> to

00:00:12.890 --> 00:00:12.900 
give you information that we have to

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:14.150 
give you information that we have to
work<00:00:13.080> backwards<00:00:13.349> and<00:00:13.799> you<00:00:13.919> use<00:00:14.129> that

00:00:14.150 --> 00:00:14.160 
work backwards and you use that

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:16.160 
work backwards and you use that
information<00:00:14.460> to<00:00:14.940> go<00:00:15.179> forward<00:00:15.629> so<00:00:15.780> we're<00:00:15.929> kind

00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:16.170 
information to go forward so we're kind

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:18.470 
information to go forward so we're kind
of<00:00:16.260> reviewing<00:00:16.860> a<00:00:17.100> little<00:00:17.370> bit<00:00:17.520> okay

00:00:18.470 --> 00:00:18.480 
of reviewing a little bit okay

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:21.080 
of reviewing a little bit okay
let's<00:00:18.870> say<00:00:19.140> that<00:00:19.350> we<00:00:19.530> have<00:00:19.800> the<00:00:20.040> area<00:00:20.550> and<00:00:20.880> this

00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:21.090 
let's say that we have the area and this

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:22.970 
let's say that we have the area and this
time<00:00:21.360> we're<00:00:21.510> going<00:00:21.600> to<00:00:21.660> say<00:00:21.990> these<00:00:22.530> are<00:00:22.740> all

00:00:22.970 --> 00:00:22.980 
time we're going to say these are all

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:27.080 
time we're going to say these are all
spheres<00:00:23.630> so<00:00:24.630> this<00:00:24.840> is<00:00:25.050> the<00:00:25.200> area<00:00:25.620> of<00:00:25.860> a<00:00:26.370> sphere

00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:27.090 
spheres so this is the area of a sphere

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:31.940 
spheres so this is the area of a sphere
and<00:00:27.750> we<00:00:28.760> need<00:00:29.760> to<00:00:29.970> find<00:00:30.240> the<00:00:30.990> volume<00:00:31.350> the

00:00:31.940 --> 00:00:31.950 
and we need to find the volume the

00:00:31.950 --> 00:00:34.279 
and we need to find the volume the
radius<00:00:32.309> and<00:00:32.550> the<00:00:32.730> diameter<00:00:33.149> okay

00:00:34.279 --> 00:00:34.289 
radius and the diameter okay

00:00:34.289 --> 00:00:36.799 
radius and the diameter okay
so<00:00:34.710> we're<00:00:35.010> given<00:00:35.370> a<00:00:35.579> problem<00:00:35.969> where<00:00:36.329> we've<00:00:36.570> got

00:00:36.799 --> 00:00:36.809 
so we're given a problem where we've got

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:41.799 
so we're given a problem where we've got
a<00:00:36.839> sphere<00:00:37.260> has<00:00:37.760> an<00:00:38.760> area<00:00:39.570> of<00:00:39.920> 24<00:00:40.920> square<00:00:41.190> inches

00:00:41.799 --> 00:00:41.809 
a sphere has an area of 24 square inches

00:00:41.809 --> 00:00:44.930 
a sphere has an area of 24 square inches
we're<00:00:42.809> going<00:00:42.989> to<00:00:43.050> first<00:00:43.350> have<00:00:43.620> to<00:00:43.800> find<00:00:44.219> the

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:44.940 
we're going to first have to find the

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:46.549 
we're going to first have to find the
radius<00:00:45.329> and<00:00:45.570> the<00:00:45.629> diameter<00:00:46.019> and<00:00:46.350> we're<00:00:46.440> going

00:00:46.549 --> 00:00:46.559 
radius and the diameter and we're going

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:49.310 
radius and the diameter and we're going
to<00:00:46.589> do<00:00:46.829> that<00:00:47.010> by<00:00:47.190> using<00:00:47.249> the<00:00:47.879> area<00:00:48.269> formula<00:00:48.570> so

00:00:49.310 --> 00:00:49.320 
to do that by using the area formula so

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:52.729 
to do that by using the area formula so
the<00:00:49.409> area<00:00:49.769> formula<00:00:50.010> is<00:00:50.489> equal<00:00:50.909> to<00:00:51.120> 4<00:00:51.600> PI<00:00:52.319> R

00:00:52.729 --> 00:00:52.739 
the area formula is equal to 4 PI R

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:55.700 
the area formula is equal to 4 PI R
squared<00:00:53.399> so<00:00:54.089> I'm<00:00:54.239> going<00:00:54.420> to<00:00:54.480> plug<00:00:54.690> in<00:00:54.899> my<00:00:55.019> 24

00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:55.710 
squared so I'm going to plug in my 24

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:57.290 
squared so I'm going to plug in my 24
right<00:00:55.890> here<00:00:56.159> for<00:00:56.339> the<00:00:56.429> area<00:00:56.730> cuz<00:00:56.940> that's<00:00:57.120> what

00:00:57.290 --> 00:00:57.300 
right here for the area cuz that's what

00:00:57.300 --> 00:01:02.000 
right here for the area cuz that's what
I<00:00:57.329> know<00:00:57.449> so<00:00:57.979> 24<00:00:58.979> is<00:00:59.219> equal<00:00:59.460> to<00:00:59.699> 4<00:00:59.999> PI<00:01:00.719> R<00:01:01.109> squared

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:02.010 
I know so 24 is equal to 4 PI R squared

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:04.520 
I know so 24 is equal to 4 PI R squared
and<00:01:02.280> then<00:01:03.030> I've<00:01:03.239> just<00:01:03.269> got<00:01:03.629> to<00:01:03.749> solve<00:01:03.989> that<00:01:04.200> so

00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:04.530 
and then I've just got to solve that so

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:08.560 
and then I've just got to solve that so
to<00:01:04.590> solve<00:01:04.890> it<00:01:05.040> I'm<00:01:05.220> gonna<00:01:05.370> divide<00:01:05.900> by<00:01:06.900> 4<00:01:07.410> and

00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:08.570 
to solve it I'm gonna divide by 4 and

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:11.300 
to solve it I'm gonna divide by 4 and
I'm<00:01:09.570> also<00:01:09.840> going<00:01:10.110> to<00:01:10.170> divide<00:01:10.470> by<00:01:10.650> PI<00:01:10.920> because

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:11.310 
I'm also going to divide by PI because

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:14.800 
I'm also going to divide by PI because
if<00:01:11.490> you<00:01:11.610> remember<00:01:11.910> pi<00:01:12.360> is<00:01:12.840> just<00:01:13.770> a<00:01:13.890> constant

00:01:14.800 --> 00:01:14.810 
if you remember pi is just a constant

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:17.690 
if you remember pi is just a constant
3.1415<00:01:15.810> okay<00:01:16.560> so<00:01:16.680> now<00:01:16.980> watch<00:01:17.250> how<00:01:17.430> I'm<00:01:17.520> gonna

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:17.700 
3.1415 okay so now watch how I'm gonna

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:20.180 
3.1415 okay so now watch how I'm gonna
put<00:01:17.880> this<00:01:17.970> in<00:01:18.030> my<00:01:18.240> calculator<00:01:18.740> I'm<00:01:19.740> gonna<00:01:19.920> take

00:01:20.180 --> 00:01:20.190 
put this in my calculator I'm gonna take

00:01:20.190 --> 00:01:23.810 
put this in my calculator I'm gonna take
24<00:01:20.850> and<00:01:21.210> I'm<00:01:21.600> gonna<00:01:21.930> divide<00:01:22.290> it<00:01:22.350> by<00:01:22.800> both<00:01:23.430> of

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:23.820 
24 and I'm gonna divide it by both of

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:25.910 
24 and I'm gonna divide it by both of
those<00:01:24.090> terms<00:01:24.390> so<00:01:24.690> to<00:01:24.750> tell<00:01:25.080> the<00:01:25.170> calculator<00:01:25.350> to

00:01:25.910 --> 00:01:25.920 
those terms so to tell the calculator to

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:27.380 
those terms so to tell the calculator to
do<00:01:26.040> that<00:01:26.190> I'm<00:01:26.370> actually<00:01:26.580> going<00:01:26.910> to<00:01:27.000> open<00:01:27.090> my

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:27.390 
do that I'm actually going to open my

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:31.420 
do that I'm actually going to open my
parentheses<00:01:27.800> and<00:01:28.800> I'm<00:01:28.950> gonna<00:01:29.160> put<00:01:29.400> 4<00:01:29.670> PI<00:01:30.030> in

00:01:31.420 --> 00:01:31.430 
parentheses and I'm gonna put 4 PI in

00:01:31.430 --> 00:01:35.900 
parentheses and I'm gonna put 4 PI in
parentheses<00:01:32.430> underneath<00:01:33.060> the<00:01:34.220> 24<00:01:35.220> so<00:01:35.460> 24

00:01:35.900 --> 00:01:35.910 
parentheses underneath the 24 so 24

00:01:35.910 --> 00:01:38.390 
parentheses underneath the 24 so 24
divided<00:01:36.360> by<00:01:36.470> parentheses<00:01:37.470> 4<00:01:37.830> pi<00:01:38.040> close

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:38.400 
divided by parentheses 4 pi close

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:42.020 
divided by parentheses 4 pi close
parentheses<00:01:39.030> and<00:01:39.330> that<00:01:40.080> gives<00:01:40.920> me<00:01:41.250> my<00:01:41.820> R

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:42.030 
parentheses and that gives me my R

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:46.400 
parentheses and that gives me my R
squared<00:01:42.570> so<00:01:43.110> I<00:01:43.170> have<00:01:43.350> one<00:01:43.590> point<00:01:44.210> nine<00:01:45.210> one<00:01:45.690> so

00:01:46.400 --> 00:01:46.410 
squared so I have one point nine one so

00:01:46.410 --> 00:01:47.990 
squared so I have one point nine one so
we<00:01:46.500> always<00:01:46.650> want<00:01:46.740> to<00:01:47.070> round<00:01:47.220> to<00:01:47.370> two

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:48.000 
we always want to round to two

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:50.210 
we always want to round to two
hundredths<00:01:48.510> so<00:01:48.990> one<00:01:49.170> point<00:01:49.440> nine<00:01:49.620> one<00:01:49.980> is

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:50.220 
hundredths so one point nine one is

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:53.900 
hundredths so one point nine one is
equal<00:01:50.610> to<00:01:50.850> R<00:01:51.500> squared<00:01:52.500> and<00:01:52.800> always<00:01:53.340> to<00:01:53.520> undo<00:01:53.880> a

00:01:53.900 --> 00:01:53.910 
equal to R squared and always to undo a

00:01:53.910 --> 00:01:56.390 
equal to R squared and always to undo a
square<00:01:54.270> we<00:01:55.230> can<00:01:55.410> take<00:01:55.590> the<00:01:55.740> square<00:01:55.860> root<00:01:56.160> so

00:01:56.390 --> 00:01:56.400 
square we can take the square root so

00:01:56.400 --> 00:01:59.020 
square we can take the square root so
now<00:01:56.550> I'm<00:01:56.670> going<00:01:56.820> to<00:01:56.880> take<00:01:57.150> the<00:01:57.840> square<00:01:58.110> root<00:01:58.500> of

00:01:59.020 --> 00:01:59.030 
now I'm going to take the square root of

00:01:59.030 --> 00:02:03.860 
now I'm going to take the square root of
that<00:02:00.030> number<00:02:00.090> and<00:02:01.340> I<00:02:02.340> get<00:02:02.400> one<00:02:02.880> point<00:02:03.330> three

00:02:03.860 --> 00:02:03.870 
that number and I get one point three

00:02:03.870 --> 00:02:07.190 
that number and I get one point three
eight<00:02:04.130> so<00:02:05.130> that<00:02:05.160> is<00:02:05.640> my<00:02:05.880> radius

00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:07.200 
eight so that is my radius

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:10.680 
eight so that is my radius
okay<00:02:08.200> so<00:02:08.259> I'll<00:02:08.560> fill<00:02:08.950> that<00:02:09.130> in<00:02:09.310> up<00:02:09.460> here<00:02:09.700> 1.38

00:02:10.680 --> 00:02:10.690 
okay so I'll fill that in up here 1.38

00:02:10.690 --> 00:02:14.220 
okay so I'll fill that in up here 1.38
is<00:02:11.380> my<00:02:11.710> radius<00:02:12.160> now<00:02:12.970> how<00:02:13.600> do<00:02:13.660> I<00:02:13.810> find<00:02:14.080> the

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:14.230 
is my radius now how do I find the

00:02:14.230 --> 00:02:16.410 
is my radius now how do I find the
diameter<00:02:14.800> I<00:02:14.980> just<00:02:15.580> double<00:02:15.910> that<00:02:15.940> so<00:02:16.240> I'm<00:02:16.300> going

00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:16.420 
diameter I just double that so I'm going

00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:18.360 
diameter I just double that so I'm going
to<00:02:16.480> take<00:02:16.690> my<00:02:16.930> rounded<00:02:17.560> answer<00:02:17.740> one<00:02:18.070> point

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:18.370 
to take my rounded answer one point

00:02:18.370 --> 00:02:22.610 
to take my rounded answer one point
three<00:02:18.670> eight<00:02:18.700> times<00:02:19.330> two<00:02:19.720> so<00:02:20.620> my<00:02:20.770> diameter<00:02:21.310> is

00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:22.620 
three eight times two so my diameter is

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:27.720 
three eight times two so my diameter is
2.76<00:02:25.230> okay<00:02:26.230> and<00:02:26.500> I've<00:02:26.770> got<00:02:27.040> that<00:02:27.250> part<00:02:27.490> done

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:27.730 
2.76 okay and I've got that part done

00:02:27.730 --> 00:02:30.660 
2.76 okay and I've got that part done
now<00:02:28.120> we<00:02:28.180> need<00:02:28.630> to<00:02:28.720> find<00:02:28.900> the<00:02:29.050> volume<00:02:29.610> okay<00:02:30.610> so

00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:30.670 
now we need to find the volume okay so

00:02:30.670 --> 00:02:32.730 
now we need to find the volume okay so
for<00:02:31.180> the<00:02:31.270> volume<00:02:31.750> formula<00:02:32.020> I've<00:02:32.230> jotted<00:02:32.500> it

00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:32.740 
for the volume formula I've jotted it

00:02:32.740 --> 00:02:37.410 
for the volume formula I've jotted it
down<00:02:32.800> here<00:02:33.280> it's<00:02:33.490> 4/3<00:02:34.360> pi<00:02:35.290> times<00:02:35.980> radius<00:02:36.420> cubed

00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:37.420 
down here it's 4/3 pi times radius cubed

00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:39.810 
down here it's 4/3 pi times radius cubed
remember<00:02:37.990> to<00:02:38.080> cube<00:02:38.380> it<00:02:38.500> okay<00:02:39.280> so<00:02:39.340> we<00:02:39.550> need<00:02:39.730> the

00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:39.820 
remember to cube it okay so we need the

00:02:39.820 --> 00:02:41.430 
remember to cube it okay so we need the
radius<00:02:40.120> so<00:02:40.330> let's<00:02:40.510> go<00:02:40.660> back<00:02:40.840> over<00:02:40.959> here<00:02:41.110> and

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:41.440 
radius so let's go back over here and

00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:44.340 
radius so let's go back over here and
plug<00:02:41.709> in<00:02:42.070> our<00:02:42.310> radius<00:02:43.300> so<00:02:44.080> we're<00:02:44.200> going<00:02:44.290> to

00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:44.350 
plug in our radius so we're going to

00:02:44.350 --> 00:02:50.699 
plug in our radius so we're going to
take<00:02:44.700> 4/3<00:02:45.780> times<00:02:46.780> pi<00:02:47.260> we're<00:02:48.130> gonna<00:02:48.280> times<00:02:49.709> 1.38

00:02:50.699 --> 00:02:50.709 
take 4/3 times pi we're gonna times 1.38

00:02:50.709 --> 00:02:53.040 
take 4/3 times pi we're gonna times 1.38
quantity<00:02:51.610> cubed<00:02:52.180> and<00:02:52.390> I<00:02:52.450> can<00:02:52.660> just<00:02:52.780> put<00:02:52.989> that

00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:53.050 
quantity cubed and I can just put that

00:02:53.050 --> 00:02:55.860 
quantity cubed and I can just put that
all<00:02:53.230> in<00:02:53.709> the<00:02:53.830> calculator<00:02:54.370> at<00:02:54.520> one<00:02:54.700> time<00:02:54.970> so<00:02:55.780> I'm

00:02:55.860 --> 00:02:55.870 
all in the calculator at one time so I'm

00:02:55.870 --> 00:02:59.430 
all in the calculator at one time so I'm
going<00:02:56.020> to<00:02:56.050> do<00:02:56.640> 4/3<00:02:57.640> I<00:02:58.000> don't<00:02:58.959> need<00:02:59.140> a<00:02:59.170> bracket

00:02:59.430 --> 00:02:59.440 
going to do 4/3 I don't need a bracket

00:02:59.440 --> 00:03:00.750 
going to do 4/3 I don't need a bracket
because<00:02:59.770> I<00:02:59.860> don't<00:03:00.040> need<00:03:00.220> the<00:03:00.340> PI<00:03:00.520> on<00:03:00.580> the

00:03:00.750 --> 00:03:00.760 
because I don't need the PI on the

00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:05.430 
because I don't need the PI on the
bottom<00:03:01.090> so<00:03:01.840> times<00:03:02.170> pi<00:03:02.650> times<00:03:03.810> and<00:03:04.810> I'm<00:03:05.230> going

00:03:05.430 --> 00:03:05.440 
bottom so times pi times and I'm going

00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:07.140 
bottom so times pi times and I'm going
to<00:03:05.500> put<00:03:05.680> this<00:03:05.860> in<00:03:06.130> a<00:03:06.220> bracket<00:03:06.610> just<00:03:06.640> to<00:03:06.970> make

00:03:07.140 --> 00:03:07.150 
to put this in a bracket just to make

00:03:07.150 --> 00:03:09.800 
to put this in a bracket just to make
sure<00:03:07.180> it<00:03:07.540> cubes<00:03:07.900> it<00:03:08.110> correctly<00:03:08.470> one<00:03:09.310> point

00:03:09.800 --> 00:03:09.810 
sure it cubes it correctly one point

00:03:09.810 --> 00:03:13.229 
sure it cubes it correctly one point
three<00:03:10.810> eight<00:03:11.049> and<00:03:11.680> then<00:03:12.640> I'm<00:03:12.850> going<00:03:13.030> to<00:03:13.090> use

00:03:13.229 --> 00:03:13.239 
three eight and then I'm going to use

00:03:13.239 --> 00:03:17.850 
three eight and then I'm going to use
math<00:03:13.480> three<00:03:13.870> to<00:03:14.019> get<00:03:14.110> my<00:03:14.260> cube<00:03:16.350> okay<00:03:17.350> so<00:03:17.410> this

00:03:17.850 --> 00:03:17.860 
math three to get my cube okay so this

00:03:17.860 --> 00:03:19.320 
math three to get my cube okay so this
is<00:03:18.040> what<00:03:18.220> it<00:03:18.340> should<00:03:18.370> look<00:03:18.580> like<00:03:18.850> on<00:03:19.209> your

00:03:19.320 --> 00:03:19.330 
is what it should look like on your

00:03:19.330 --> 00:03:22.620 
is what it should look like on your
screen<00:03:19.720> 4/3<00:03:20.650> times<00:03:21.100> pi<00:03:21.370> times<00:03:21.700> one<00:03:22.450> point

00:03:22.620 --> 00:03:22.630 
screen 4/3 times pi times one point

00:03:22.630 --> 00:03:27.199 
screen 4/3 times pi times one point
three<00:03:22.870> eight<00:03:22.959> quantity<00:03:23.769> cubed<00:03:24.340> and<00:03:25.049> you<00:03:26.049> get

00:03:27.199 --> 00:03:27.209 
three eight quantity cubed and you get

00:03:27.209 --> 00:03:30.479 
three eight quantity cubed and you get
11.00<00:03:28.209> eight<00:03:28.630> or<00:03:29.110> eleven<00:03:29.590> point<00:03:29.830> zero<00:03:30.100> one

00:03:30.479 --> 00:03:30.489 
11.00 eight or eleven point zero one

00:03:30.489 --> 00:03:33.020 
11.00 eight or eleven point zero one
because<00:03:30.850> that<00:03:30.880> would<00:03:31.150> round<00:03:31.299> up<00:03:31.510> so<00:03:32.470> I<00:03:32.500> get

00:03:33.020 --> 00:03:33.030 
because that would round up so I get

00:03:33.030 --> 00:03:38.130 
because that would round up so I get
eleven<00:03:34.030> point<00:03:34.330> zero<00:03:35.459> one<00:03:36.459> and<00:03:36.820> this<00:03:37.660> would<00:03:37.930> be

00:03:38.130 --> 00:03:38.140 
eleven point zero one and this would be

00:03:38.140 --> 00:03:42.810 
eleven point zero one and this would be
in<00:03:38.560> inches<00:03:39.630> cubed<00:03:40.860> so<00:03:41.860> that<00:03:41.890> is<00:03:42.280> how<00:03:42.430> I<00:03:42.459> find

00:03:42.810 --> 00:03:42.820 
in inches cubed so that is how I find

00:03:42.820 --> 00:03:44.190 
in inches cubed so that is how I find
the<00:03:42.880> volume<00:03:43.180> so<00:03:43.450> you've<00:03:43.600> got<00:03:43.840> kind<00:03:44.019> of<00:03:44.110> a

00:03:44.190 --> 00:03:44.200 
the volume so you've got kind of a

00:03:44.200 --> 00:03:46.110 
the volume so you've got kind of a
backwards<00:03:44.410> to<00:03:44.739> see<00:03:44.920> a<00:03:44.950> problem<00:03:45.220> where<00:03:45.970> we're

00:03:46.110 --> 00:03:46.120 
backwards to see a problem where we're

00:03:46.120 --> 00:03:49.080 
backwards to see a problem where we're
working<00:03:46.299> from<00:03:46.930> the<00:03:47.260> area<00:03:47.680> back<00:03:48.280> to<00:03:48.340> the<00:03:48.670> radius

00:03:49.080 --> 00:03:49.090 
working from the area back to the radius

00:03:49.090 --> 00:03:51.090 
working from the area back to the radius
and<00:03:49.299> the<00:03:49.360> diameter<00:03:49.660> and<00:03:50.079> then<00:03:50.560> using<00:03:50.920> that<00:03:50.950> to

00:03:51.090 --> 00:03:51.100 
and the diameter and then using that to

00:03:51.100 --> 00:03:53.520 
and the diameter and then using that to
find<00:03:51.370> the<00:03:51.489> volume<00:03:51.670> okay<00:03:52.390> so<00:03:52.900> the<00:03:53.079> key<00:03:53.290> is

00:03:53.520 --> 00:03:53.530 
find the volume okay so the key is

00:03:53.530 --> 00:03:55.350 
find the volume okay so the key is
you're<00:03:54.190> always<00:03:54.370> going<00:03:54.579> to<00:03:54.730> want<00:03:54.910> to<00:03:55.030> work<00:03:55.150> from

you're always going to want to work from

00:03:55.360 --> 00:03:57.150 
you're always going to want to work from

measurement and linear measurement to a

00:03:58.750 --> 00:04:02.130 
measurement and linear measurement to a
cube<00:03:59.170> okay<00:04:00.000> now<00:04:01.000> let's<00:04:01.630> look<00:04:01.690> at<00:04:01.900> the<00:04:01.989> word

00:04:02.130 --> 00:04:02.140 
cube okay now let's look at the word

00:04:02.140 --> 00:04:03.900 
cube okay now let's look at the word
problems<00:04:02.650> here<00:04:02.890> let's<00:04:03.160> see<00:04:03.310> how<00:04:03.430> we<00:04:03.489> can<00:04:03.760> do

00:04:03.900 --> 00:04:03.910 
problems here let's see how we can do

00:04:03.910 --> 00:04:05.310 
problems here let's see how we can do
and<00:04:04.090> these<00:04:04.540> are<00:04:04.600> nice<00:04:04.900> because<00:04:04.930> they're

00:04:05.310 --> 00:04:05.320 
and these are nice because they're

00:04:05.320 --> 00:04:08.160 
and these are nice because they're
multiple<00:04:05.769> choice<00:04:05.980> okay<00:04:06.790> a<00:04:06.820> bowling<00:04:07.269> ball<00:04:07.480> has
