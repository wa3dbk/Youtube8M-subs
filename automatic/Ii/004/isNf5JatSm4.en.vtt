like sent off as well i'm gonna i'm
ordering<00:03:04.840> parts<00:03:05.080> for<00:03:05.970> doing<00:03:06.970> those<00:03:07.180> colors

00:03:08.479 --> 00:03:08.489 
ordering parts for doing those colors

00:03:08.489 --> 00:03:11.820 
ordering parts for doing those colors
sand<00:03:09.489> green<00:03:09.760> torso<00:03:10.360> and<00:03:10.570> those<00:03:11.140> colored<00:03:11.560> legs

so basically these are the colors i'm

00:03:14.290 --> 00:03:17.960 
so basically these are the colors i'm
doing<00:03:14.680> next<00:03:14.920> and<00:03:15.280> then<00:03:16.269> i'll<00:03:16.510> probably<00:03:16.840> go<00:03:17.230> to

00:03:17.960 --> 00:03:17.970 
doing next and then i'll probably go to

00:03:17.970 --> 00:03:22.110 
doing next and then i'll probably go to
these<00:03:18.970> colors<00:03:19.720> up<00:03:19.930> here<00:03:20.260> and<00:03:20.880> i'll<00:03:21.880> probably

00:03:22.110 --> 00:03:22.120 
these colors up here and i'll probably

00:03:22.120 --> 00:03:23.460 
these colors up here and i'll probably
do<00:03:22.330> these<00:03:22.480> in<00:03:22.630> ways<00:03:22.810> but<00:03:23.140> these<00:03:23.260> are<00:03:23.410> just
