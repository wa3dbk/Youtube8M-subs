00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:45.360 
just like that right so I do that and I

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:47.600 
just like that right so I do that and I
do<00:01:45.420> that<00:01:45.710> and<00:01:46.710> that's<00:01:46.979> how<00:01:47.070> you<00:01:47.130> make<00:01:47.310> a<00:01:47.340> card

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:47.610 
do that and that's how you make a card

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:48.800 
do that and that's how you make a card
appear<00:01:47.850> out<00:01:47.970> of<00:01:48.060> nowhere<00:01:48.210> now<00:01:48.509> to<00:01:48.570> make<00:01:48.780> it

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:48.810 
appear out of nowhere now to make it

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:51.649 
appear out of nowhere now to make it
disappear<00:01:49.220> it's<00:01:50.220> basically<00:01:50.820> the<00:01:51.000> same<00:01:51.210> motion

00:01:51.649 --> 00:01:51.659 
disappear it's basically the same motion

00:01:51.659 --> 00:01:53.929 
disappear it's basically the same motion
but<00:01:51.840> in<00:01:51.960> Reverse<00:01:52.259> right<00:01:52.409> I<00:01:52.740> start<00:01:53.399> here<00:01:53.670> three

00:01:53.929 --> 00:01:53.939 
but in Reverse right I start here three

00:01:53.939 --> 00:01:55.280 
but in Reverse right I start here three
fingers<00:01:54.210> on<00:01:54.360> the<00:01:54.420> back<00:01:54.540> thumb<00:01:54.840> right<00:01:55.049> there

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:55.290 
fingers on the back thumb right there

00:01:55.290 --> 00:01:58.069 
fingers on the back thumb right there
and<00:01:55.439> what<00:01:56.340> I<00:01:56.369> do<00:01:56.490> is<00:01:56.700> as<00:01:56.820> I<00:01:57.030> curl<00:01:57.420> these<00:01:57.780> two

00:01:58.069 --> 00:01:58.079 
and what I do is as I curl these two

00:01:58.079 --> 00:01:59.990 
and what I do is as I curl these two
fingers<00:01:58.500> in<00:01:58.649> kind<00:01:59.009> of<00:01:59.070> like<00:01:59.189> spider-man<00:01:59.610> doing

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:00.000 
fingers in kind of like spider-man doing

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:02.389 
fingers in kind of like spider-man doing
the<00:02:00.119> web-slinging<00:02:00.600> thing<00:02:01.020> right<00:02:01.320> as<00:02:01.439> I<00:02:02.100> curl

00:02:02.389 --> 00:02:02.399 
the web-slinging thing right as I curl

00:02:02.399 --> 00:02:04.459 
the web-slinging thing right as I curl
these<00:02:02.969> fingers<00:02:03.420> in<00:02:03.540> I'm<00:02:03.659> actually<00:02:03.840> pinching

00:02:04.459 --> 00:02:04.469 
these fingers in I'm actually pinching

00:02:04.469 --> 00:02:07.550 
these fingers in I'm actually pinching
it<00:02:04.880> with<00:02:05.880> my<00:02:06.030> pinky<00:02:06.420> and<00:02:06.450> my<00:02:06.689> index

00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:07.560 
it with my pinky and my index

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:10.609 
it with my pinky and my index
maybe<00:02:08.280> I<00:02:08.399> can<00:02:08.670> hold<00:02:08.850> the<00:02:08.970> card<00:02:09.209> just<00:02:10.170> like<00:02:10.350> that

00:02:10.609 --> 00:02:10.619 
maybe I can hold the card just like that

00:02:10.619 --> 00:02:13.760 
maybe I can hold the card just like that
right<00:02:11.430> so<00:02:11.780> that<00:02:12.780> all<00:02:12.990> I'm<00:02:13.140> doing<00:02:13.440> right<00:02:13.590> from

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:13.770 
right so that all I'm doing right from

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:16.370 
right so that all I'm doing right from
here<00:02:14.180> it's<00:02:15.180> just<00:02:15.330> that<00:02:15.630> it's<00:02:16.020> really<00:02:16.110> just

00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:16.380 
here it's just that it's really just

00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:19.250 
here it's just that it's really just
that<00:02:16.830> simple<00:02:17.150> this<00:02:18.150> move<00:02:18.360> requires<00:02:18.510> a<00:02:18.840> lot<00:02:19.230> of

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:19.260 
that simple this move requires a lot of

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:22.490 
that simple this move requires a lot of
practice<00:02:20.120> go<00:02:21.120> slow<00:02:21.780> when<00:02:22.050> you're<00:02:22.200> starting

00:02:22.490 --> 00:02:22.500 
practice go slow when you're starting

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:24.640 
practice go slow when you're starting
out<00:02:22.650> you<00:02:22.800> don't<00:02:23.040> need<00:02:23.370> to<00:02:23.520> do<00:02:23.670> it<00:02:23.700> fast<00:02:24.000> right

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:24.650 
out you don't need to do it fast right

00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:27.320 
out you don't need to do it fast right
you<00:02:25.650> guys<00:02:25.800> know<00:02:25.980> that<00:02:26.300> practice<00:02:27.300> makes

00:02:27.320 --> 00:02:27.330 
you guys know that practice makes

00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:28.940 
you guys know that practice makes
perfect<00:02:27.720> you<00:02:27.989> know<00:02:28.080> but<00:02:28.230> practice<00:02:28.590> it's<00:02:28.739> slow

00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:28.950 
perfect you know but practice it's slow

00:02:28.950 --> 00:02:30.559 
perfect you know but practice it's slow
so<00:02:29.130> that<00:02:29.160> you<00:02:29.310> can<00:02:29.430> get<00:02:29.550> the<00:02:29.640> hang<00:02:29.790> of<00:02:29.940> it<00:02:30.060> all
