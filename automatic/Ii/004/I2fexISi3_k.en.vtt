foot<00:03:11.400> 2<00:03:11.610> so<00:03:11.910> it's<00:03:12.360> obviously<00:03:12.600> going<00:03:12.720> to<00:03:12.810> get

00:03:12.920 --> 00:03:12.930 
foot 2 so it's obviously going to get

is<00:03:39.360> a<00:03:39.390> pretty<00:03:39.750> decent<00:03:40.440> record<00:03:40.709> with<00:03:41.040> Thierry

00:03:41.330 --> 00:03:41.340 
is a pretty decent record with Thierry

00:03:41.340 --> 00:03:43.069 
is a pretty decent record with Thierry
Henry<00:03:41.430> and<00:03:42.030> because<00:03:42.360> it's<00:03:42.480> not<00:03:42.570> exactly<00:03:42.930> the
