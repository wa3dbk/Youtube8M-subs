sneaks let's start with the kt8 which is
just<00:00:14.610> an<00:00:14.759> early<00:00:15.240> look<00:00:15.389> so<00:00:15.599> don't<00:00:15.839> form<00:00:16.080> too

00:00:16.310 --> 00:00:16.320 
just an early look so don't form too

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:18.050 
just an early look so don't form too
many<00:00:16.560> opinions<00:00:16.680> about<00:00:17.039> the<00:00:17.160> shoe<00:00:17.430> just<00:00:17.730> yet<00:00:17.940> it

00:00:18.050 --> 00:00:18.060 
many opinions about the shoe just yet it

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:19.640 
many opinions about the shoe just yet it
looks<00:00:18.090> a<00:00:18.300> lot<00:00:18.449> like<00:00:18.630> an<00:00:18.779> air<00:00:18.960> max<00:00:19.170> runner<00:00:19.439> but

00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:19.650 
looks a lot like an air max runner but

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:21.890 
looks a lot like an air max runner but
then<00:00:19.740> again<00:00:19.859> this<00:00:20.400> is<00:00:20.640> an<00:00:20.880> early<00:00:21.090> look<00:00:21.390> from

00:00:23.359 --> 00:00:23.369 
the image of the outsole I'm thinking it

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:25.160
