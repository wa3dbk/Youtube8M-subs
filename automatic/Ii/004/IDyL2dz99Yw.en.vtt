another Pocket Edition video and I'm
going<00:00:09.330> to<00:00:09.450> do<00:00:09.630> a<00:00:11.300> what<00:00:12.300> how<00:00:12.509> to<00:00:12.570> find<00:00:13.049> out<00:00:13.200> if

00:00:13.370 --> 00:00:13.380 
going to do a what how to find out if

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:18.620 
going to do a what how to find out if
her<00:00:13.559> brain<00:00:13.799> is<00:00:13.980> on<00:00:14.160> your<00:00:14.370> world<00:00:14.960> so<00:00:16.789> one<00:00:17.789> it

00:00:18.620 --> 00:00:18.630 
her brain is on your world so one it

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:21.470 
her brain is on your world so one it
would<00:00:18.779> be<00:00:18.810> a<00:00:18.930> path<00:00:19.680> of<00:00:20.189> flowers<00:00:20.580> leading<00:00:21.240> to

00:00:21.470 --> 00:00:21.480 
would be a path of flowers leading to

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:24.679 
would be a path of flowers leading to
some<00:00:21.810> direction<00:00:23.000> some<00:00:24.000> random<00:00:24.539> direction

00:00:24.679 --> 00:00:24.689 
some direction some random direction

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:26.170 
some direction some random direction
anywhere<00:00:25.500> actually

00:00:26.170 --> 00:00:26.180 
anywhere actually

00:00:26.180 --> 00:00:32.330 
anywhere actually
there<00:00:27.180> would<00:00:27.359> be<00:00:27.920> let's<00:00:28.920> see<00:00:30.800> floating<00:00:31.800> blocks

00:00:32.330 --> 00:00:32.340 
there would be let's see floating blocks

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:35.750 
there would be let's see floating blocks
in<00:00:32.790> the<00:00:32.940> air<00:00:33.090> like<00:00:33.630> that<00:00:33.870> one<00:00:34.460> I<00:00:35.460> don't<00:00:35.579> know

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:35.760 
in the air like that one I don't know

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:40.190 
in the air like that one I don't know
how<00:00:35.940> that<00:00:36.000> even<00:00:36.420> got<00:00:36.690> up<00:00:36.870> there<00:00:38.300> um<00:00:39.300> what<00:00:40.170> else

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:40.200 
how that even got up there um what else

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:43.030 
how that even got up there um what else
there<00:00:41.160> would<00:00:41.280> be<00:00:41.309> random<00:00:41.700> ages<00:00:42.420> everywhere

00:00:43.030 --> 00:00:43.040 
there would be random ages everywhere

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:46.760 
there would be random ages everywhere
like<00:00:44.040> for<00:00:44.489> instance<00:00:44.640> one<00:00:45.180> there<00:00:45.450> I<00:00:45.690> don't<00:00:46.590> know

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:46.770 
like for instance one there I don't know

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:49.069 
like for instance one there I don't know

one away is a black sheep more black

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:39.830 
one away is a black sheep more black
sheep<00:01:35.640> than<00:01:36.060> white<00:01:36.299> cheap<00:01:37.880> honor<00:01:38.880> the<00:01:39.390> way<00:01:39.509> is

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:39.840 
sheep than white cheap honor the way is

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:47.270 
sheep than white cheap honor the way is
um<00:01:42.259> what<00:01:43.259> is<00:01:43.409> it<00:01:43.590> the<00:01:43.680> other<00:01:43.740> way<00:01:43.890> that<00:01:45.049> um<00:01:46.280> what

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:47.280 
um what is it the other way that um what

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:49.880 
um what is it the other way that um what
was<00:01:47.520> that<00:01:48.329> there<00:01:48.780> would<00:01:48.899> be<00:01:48.930> rent<00:01:49.380> that<00:01:49.710> the

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:49.890 
was that there would be rent that the

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:52.429 
was that there would be rent that the
sand<00:01:50.250> wouldn't<00:01:50.790> fall<00:01:51.119> when<00:01:51.540> you<00:01:51.960> delete<00:01:52.320> a

00:01:52.429 --> 00:01:52.439 
sand wouldn't fall when you delete a

00:01:52.439 --> 00:01:56.780 
sand wouldn't fall when you delete a
block<00:01:52.920> underneath<00:01:53.430> it<00:01:55.070> another<00:01:56.070> way<00:01:56.310> is<00:01:56.610> that

00:01:56.780 --> 00:01:56.790 
block underneath it another way is that

00:01:56.790 --> 00:01:59.859 
block underneath it another way is that
skeletons<00:01:57.390> will<00:01:57.659> hit<00:01:57.899> you<00:01:58.100> repeatedly<00:01:59.100> and

00:01:59.859 --> 00:01:59.869 
skeletons will hit you repeatedly and

00:01:59.869 --> 00:02:03.740 
skeletons will hit you repeatedly and
trees<00:02:00.869> would<00:02:01.640> wouldn't<00:02:02.640> have<00:02:03.000> leaves<00:02:03.299> so<00:02:03.570> it's

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:03.750 
trees would wouldn't have leaves so it's

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:06.709 
trees would wouldn't have leaves so it's
just<00:02:03.930> a<00:02:04.110> big<00:02:04.560> wood<00:02:05.009> pillar<00:02:05.600> there<00:02:06.600> would<00:02:06.689> be

00:02:06.709 --> 00:02:06.719 
just a big wood pillar there would be

00:02:06.719 --> 00:02:10.880 
just a big wood pillar there would be
random<00:02:06.960> craters<00:02:07.680> in<00:02:07.950> the<00:02:08.069> world<00:02:08.280> um<00:02:09.890> there

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:10.890 
random craters in the world um there

00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:14.230 
random craters in the world um there
would<00:02:11.039> be<00:02:11.160> random<00:02:11.370> holes<00:02:11.970> too

00:02:14.230 --> 00:02:14.240 
would be random holes too

00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:20.420 
would be random holes too
and<00:02:15.240> all<00:02:15.360> that<00:02:15.570> crap<00:02:15.960> oh<00:02:19.040> yeah<00:02:20.040> I<00:02:20.070> was<00:02:20.310> in<00:02:20.340> the
