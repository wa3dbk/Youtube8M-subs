sun<00:02:00.119> power<00:02:00.299> cells<00:02:00.600> are<00:02:00.750> fundamentally

00:02:01.399 --> 00:02:01.409 
sun power cells are fundamentally

00:02:01.409 --> 00:02:03.740 
sun power cells are fundamentally
different<00:02:01.829> than<00:02:02.159> conventional<00:02:02.790> cells<00:02:03.030> you

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:03.750 
different than conventional cells you

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:05.450 
different than conventional cells you
notice<00:02:04.020> all<00:02:04.200> the<00:02:04.320> metal<00:02:04.530> is<00:02:04.649> on<00:02:04.770> the<00:02:04.860> back<00:02:05.070> and

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:05.460 
notice all the metal is on the back and

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:08.330 
notice all the metal is on the back and
this<00:02:06.390> allows<00:02:06.659> us<00:02:06.689> to<00:02:07.530> use<00:02:07.560> that<00:02:07.920> metal<00:02:08.220> on<00:02:08.310> the

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:08.340 
this allows us to use that metal on the

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:10.969 
this allows us to use that metal on the
back<00:02:08.610> as<00:02:08.879> the<00:02:09.390> foundational<00:02:10.080> support<00:02:10.560> of<00:02:10.770> the

00:02:10.969 --> 00:02:10.979 
back as the foundational support of the

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:11.990 
back as the foundational support of the
cell

00:02:11.990 --> 00:02:12.000 
cell

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:13.580 
cell
it<00:02:12.480> means<00:02:12.720> we<00:02:12.840> can<00:02:12.960> also<00:02:13.080> make<00:02:13.290> the<00:02:13.410> filling

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:13.590 
it means we can also make the filling

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:16.100 
it means we can also make the filling
the<00:02:13.860> silicon<00:02:14.370> much<00:02:14.550> thinner<00:02:14.880> meaning<00:02:15.870> that<00:02:15.990> it

00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:16.110 
the silicon much thinner meaning that it

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:17.930 
the silicon much thinner meaning that it
is<00:02:16.260> actually<00:02:16.650> allowed<00:02:16.980> to<00:02:17.130> flex<00:02:17.430> a<00:02:17.550> little<00:02:17.670> bit

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:17.940 
is actually allowed to flex a little bit

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:20.720 
is actually allowed to flex a little bit
and<00:02:18.180> as<00:02:18.840> you<00:02:18.960> can<00:02:19.140> see<00:02:19.220> we've<00:02:20.220> got<00:02:20.250> a<00:02:20.430> curved

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:20.730 
and as you can see we've got a curved

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:22.790 
and as you can see we've got a curved
glass<00:02:21.240> surface<00:02:21.840> we've<00:02:22.020> got<00:02:22.200> to<00:02:22.290> match<00:02:22.440> up<00:02:22.620> to

00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:22.800 
glass surface we've got to match up to

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:25.790 
glass surface we've got to match up to
here<00:02:23.070> so<00:02:23.850> the<00:02:23.940> ability<00:02:24.300> to<00:02:24.450> bend<00:02:24.720> is<00:02:24.960> is<00:02:25.650> very

00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:25.800 
here so the ability to bend is is very

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:29.300 
here so the ability to bend is is very
good<00:02:27.110> additionally<00:02:28.110> we<00:02:28.770> have<00:02:28.890> much<00:02:29.100> higher

00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:29.310 
good additionally we have much higher

00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:32.540 
good additionally we have much higher
power<00:02:29.640> density<00:02:29.930> than<00:02:30.930> conventional<00:02:31.500> cells<00:02:31.740> so

00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:32.550 
power density than conventional cells so

00:02:32.550 --> 00:02:34.250 
power density than conventional cells so
that<00:02:32.580> means<00:02:32.910> out<00:02:33.060> of<00:02:33.090> out<00:02:33.690> of<00:02:33.870> the<00:02:33.990> same

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:34.260 
that means out of out of the same

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:36.800 
that means out of out of the same
space-constrained<00:02:35.190> area<00:02:35.820> we<00:02:36.480> can<00:02:36.630> actually

00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:36.810 
space-constrained area we can actually

00:02:36.810 --> 00:02:38.840 
space-constrained area we can actually
harvest<00:02:37.380> fifty<00:02:37.830> percent<00:02:38.130> more<00:02:38.340> energy<00:02:38.730> than

00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:38.850 
harvest fifty percent more energy than

00:02:38.850 --> 00:02:41.090 
harvest fifty percent more energy than
conventional<00:02:38.910> cells<00:02:39.690> could<00:02:39.959> I'm<00:02:40.920> actually

00:02:41.090 --> 00:02:41.100 
conventional cells could I'm actually

00:02:41.100 --> 00:02:42.500 
conventional cells could I'm actually
quite<00:02:41.370> excited<00:02:41.520> to<00:02:41.880> work<00:02:41.970> on<00:02:42.120> this<00:02:42.180> project

00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:42.510 
quite excited to work on this project

00:02:42.510 --> 00:02:45.260 
quite excited to work on this project
because<00:02:43.260> when<00:02:43.530> I<00:02:43.560> was<00:02:43.740> a<00:02:43.770> kid<00:02:43.860> all<00:02:44.340> we<00:02:45.150> would

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:45.270 
because when I was a kid all we would

00:02:45.270 --> 00:02:48.500 
because when I was a kid all we would
ever<00:02:45.390> see<00:02:45.510> when<00:02:46.260> you<00:02:46.380> mix<00:02:46.530> solar<00:02:46.950> and<00:02:47.250> cars<00:02:47.580> was

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:48.510 
ever see when you mix solar and cars was

00:02:48.510 --> 00:02:51.560 
ever see when you mix solar and cars was
these<00:02:48.690> small<00:02:49.100> very<00:02:50.100> impractical<00:02:50.459> cars<00:02:51.120> that

00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:51.570 
these small very impractical cars that

00:02:51.570 --> 00:02:53.960 
these small very impractical cars that
flew<00:02:51.780> across<00:02:51.989> the<00:02:52.110> Australian<00:02:52.770> desert<00:02:52.970> this

00:02:53.960 --> 00:02:53.970 
flew across the Australian desert this

00:02:53.970 --> 00:02:55.670 
flew across the Australian desert this
project<00:02:54.390> is<00:02:54.480> extremely<00:02:55.020> exciting<00:02:55.470> because

00:02:55.670 --> 00:02:55.680 
project is extremely exciting because

00:02:55.680 --> 00:02:57.979 
project is extremely exciting because
here<00:02:56.070> we're<00:02:56.220> actually<00:02:56.400> taking<00:02:56.760> real<00:02:57.720> solar

00:02:57.979 --> 00:02:57.989 
here we're actually taking real solar

00:02:57.989 --> 00:03:01.699 
here we're actually taking real solar
panels<00:02:58.440> and<00:02:59.090> we're<00:03:00.090> adapting<00:03:00.360> them<00:03:00.750> to<00:03:00.780> fit<00:03:01.620> on

00:03:01.699 --> 00:03:01.709 
panels and we're adapting them to fit on

00:03:01.709 --> 00:03:04.100 
panels and we're adapting them to fit on
top<00:03:01.739> of<00:03:02.070> a<00:03:02.130> car<00:03:02.370> but<00:03:03.209> it's<00:03:03.330> not<00:03:03.510> a<00:03:03.780> lightweight

car that's going to fly across the
Australian<00:03:06.360> outback<00:03:06.560> it's<00:03:07.560> an<00:03:07.800> everyday<00:03:08.040> car

00:03:08.180 --> 00:03:08.190 
Australian outback it's an everyday car

00:03:08.190 --> 00:03:09.530 
Australian outback it's an everyday car
that<00:03:08.610> we<00:03:08.700> could<00:03:08.850> expect<00:03:09.120> to<00:03:09.209> see<00:03:09.390> in<00:03:09.480> the

00:03:09.530 --> 00:03:09.540 
that we could expect to see in the

00:03:09.540 --> 00:03:11.479 
that we could expect to see in the
cities<00:03:09.840> and<00:03:09.870> on<00:03:10.110> the<00:03:10.200> highways<00:03:10.590> this<00:03:11.100> solution

00:03:11.479 --> 00:03:11.489 
cities and on the highways this solution

00:03:11.489 --> 00:03:13.280 
cities and on the highways this solution
where<00:03:11.940> you<00:03:12.030> couple<00:03:12.360> the<00:03:12.480> infrastructure<00:03:12.989> with

00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:13.290 
where you couple the infrastructure with

00:03:13.290 --> 00:03:15.470 
where you couple the infrastructure with
the<00:03:13.410> solar<00:03:13.650> on<00:03:13.860> the<00:03:13.920> vehicle<00:03:14.480> essentially

00:03:15.470 --> 00:03:15.480 
the solar on the vehicle essentially

00:03:15.480 --> 00:03:18.470 
the solar on the vehicle essentially
isn't<00:03:16.290> reliant<00:03:16.620> on<00:03:16.890> a<00:03:16.950> grid<00:03:17.280> anymore<00:03:17.700> and<00:03:17.910> so

00:03:18.470 --> 00:03:18.480 
isn't reliant on a grid anymore and so

00:03:18.480 --> 00:03:20.979 
isn't reliant on a grid anymore and so
if<00:03:18.690> you're<00:03:18.900> in<00:03:19.049> an<00:03:19.680> area<00:03:19.920> that<00:03:20.070> doesn't<00:03:20.730> have
