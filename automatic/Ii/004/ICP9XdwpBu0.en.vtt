there he didn't know where he was and he

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:20.720 
there he didn't know where he was and he
cried<00:02:18.360> out<00:02:18.390> for<00:02:18.750> help<00:02:19.280> and<00:02:20.280> he<00:02:20.400> was<00:02:20.519> very

cried out for help and he was very

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:23.780 
cried out for help and he was very
frightened<00:02:21.329> he<00:02:22.170> couldn't<00:02:22.530> see<00:02:22.799> how<00:02:23.459> it<00:02:23.640> got

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:23.790 
frightened he couldn't see how it got

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:26.510 
frightened he couldn't see how it got
there<00:02:24.060> he<00:02:24.599> just<00:02:24.629> knew<00:02:25.020> he<00:02:25.200> was<00:02:25.230> there<00:02:25.680> he

00:02:26.510 --> 00:02:26.520 
there he just knew he was there he

00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:30.680 
there he just knew he was there he
to<00:02:27.030> wander<00:02:27.450> around<00:02:28.100> finally<00:02:29.100> he<00:02:30.060> came<00:02:30.270> upon<00:02:30.450> a

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:30.690 
to wander around finally he came upon a

00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:33.770 
to wander around finally he came upon a
place<00:02:31.080> a<00:02:31.410> house<00:02:31.680> with<00:02:32.130> other<00:02:32.280> people<00:02:32.820> and<00:02:33.510> I

00:02:33.770 --> 00:02:33.780 
place a house with other people and I

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:35.300 
place a house with other people and I
guess<00:02:33.990> eventually<00:02:34.140> he<00:02:34.560> was<00:02:34.680> able<00:02:34.830> to<00:02:35.040> just

00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:35.310 
guess eventually he was able to just

00:02:35.310 --> 00:02:38.030 
guess eventually he was able to just
move<00:02:35.490> in<00:02:35.730> with<00:02:35.880> them<00:02:36.230> he'd<00:02:37.230> been<00:02:37.440> there<00:02:37.740> in

00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:38.040 
move in with them he'd been there in

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:41.900 
move in with them he'd been there in
that<00:02:38.190> world<00:02:38.460> for<00:02:38.970> a<00:02:39.030> very<00:02:39.450> long<00:02:40.110> time<00:02:40.910> the

00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:41.910 
that world for a very long time the

00:02:41.910 --> 00:02:45.260 
that world for a very long time the
