gear the benchmade griptilian in black
and<00:00:17.130> sand<00:00:17.369> I<00:00:18.439> feel<00:00:19.439> like<00:00:19.590> I've<00:00:19.800> somewhat

00:00:20.420 --> 00:00:20.430 
and sand I feel like I've somewhat

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:22.550 
and sand I feel like I've somewhat
splurged<00:00:20.820> on<00:00:21.150> this<00:00:21.359> knife<00:00:21.570> but<00:00:21.990> not<00:00:22.260> really

00:00:22.550 --> 00:00:22.560 
splurged on this knife but not really

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:23.990 
splurged on this knife but not really
because<00:00:22.769> I<00:00:22.920> think<00:00:23.039> it's<00:00:23.279> worthwhile<00:00:23.460> in<00:00:23.850> fact

00:00:23.990 --> 00:00:24.000 
because I think it's worthwhile in fact

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:25.700 
because I think it's worthwhile in fact
I<00:00:24.150> calculated<00:00:24.630> that<00:00:24.750> if<00:00:24.930> i<00:00:25.019> use<00:00:25.199> it<00:00:25.320> for<00:00:25.350> six

00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:25.710 
I calculated that if i use it for six

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:27.470 
I calculated that if i use it for six
years<00:00:25.980> daily<00:00:26.430> that's<00:00:26.699> three<00:00:26.970> cents<00:00:27.210> a<00:00:27.269> day

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:27.480 
years daily that's three cents a day

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:30.169 
years daily that's three cents a day
which<00:00:27.990> is<00:00:28.080> not<00:00:28.230> bad<00:00:28.279> here's<00:00:29.279> a<00:00:29.369> knife<00:00:29.609> for

00:00:30.169 --> 00:00:30.179 
which is not bad here's a knife for

00:00:30.179 --> 00:00:31.730 
which is not bad here's a knife for
those<00:00:30.330> who<00:00:30.630> have<00:00:30.900> been<00:00:31.019> waiting<00:00:31.320> to<00:00:31.439> see<00:00:31.650> it

those who have been waiting to see it

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:32.690

00:00:43.150 --> 00:00:43.160 
a in line lock uses a kind of piston

place when the Pistons pulled down the

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:52.729 
place when the Pistons pulled down the
blade<00:00:48.510> has<00:00:48.750> free<00:00:49.050> movement<00:00:49.350> and<00:00:50.570> as<00:00:51.570> such<00:00:52.079> it's

00:00:52.729 --> 00:00:52.739 
blade has free movement and as such it's

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:54.860 
blade has free movement and as such it's
very<00:00:52.860> easy<00:00:53.250> to<00:00:53.430> open<00:00:53.699> ambidextrous<00:00:54.390> leave

00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:54.870 
very easy to open ambidextrous leave

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:58.970 
very easy to open ambidextrous leave
whether<00:00:55.320> with<00:00:55.530> left<00:00:55.860> hand<00:00:56.129> or<00:00:56.789> with<00:00:57.239> the<00:00:58.140> right

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:01.490 
whether with left hand or with the right
hand<00:00:59.250> it's<00:00:59.730> very<00:00:59.940> quick<00:01:00.270> out<00:01:00.449> of<00:01:00.480> the<00:01:00.570> box<00:01:00.750> also

00:01:01.490 --> 00:01:01.500 
hand it's very quick out of the box also

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:05.000 
hand it's very quick out of the box also
it<00:01:01.800> uses<00:01:02.129> a<00:01:02.660> 154cm<00:01:03.660> blade<00:01:04.260> steel<00:01:04.589> which<00:01:04.860> is

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:05.010 
it uses a 154cm blade steel which is

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:07.730 
it uses a 154cm blade steel which is
hard<00:01:05.280> wearing<00:01:05.580> but<00:01:06.240> it's<00:01:06.390> uh<00:01:06.659> it's<00:01:06.900> not<00:01:07.619> as

00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:07.740 
hard wearing but it's uh it's not as

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:10.580 
hard wearing but it's uh it's not as
hard<00:01:07.950> as<00:01:08.040> d2<00:01:08.430> tool<00:01:09.030> steel<00:01:09.360> but<00:01:10.049> that<00:01:10.200> makes<00:01:10.380> it

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:10.590 
hard as d2 tool steel but that makes it

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:14.240 
hard as d2 tool steel but that makes it
easier<00:01:10.920> for<00:01:11.250> a<00:01:11.810> amateur<00:01:12.810> to<00:01:13.049> touch<00:01:13.439> up<00:01:13.680> so

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:14.250 
easier for a amateur to touch up so

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:16.640 
easier for a amateur to touch up so
that's<00:01:14.369> a<00:01:14.640> nice<00:01:15.030> thing<00:01:15.270> about<00:01:15.330> it<00:01:15.720> the<00:01:16.290> black

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:16.650 
that's a nice thing about it the black

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:19.219 
that's a nice thing about it the black
is<00:01:16.920> not<00:01:17.070> just<00:01:17.400> for<00:01:17.460> cool<00:01:17.759> I<00:01:18.119> there's<00:01:18.810> also<00:01:19.080> a

00:01:19.219 --> 00:01:19.229 
is not just for cool I there's also a

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:21.649 
is not just for cool I there's also a
satin<00:01:19.740> version<00:01:20.070> but<00:01:20.189> black<00:01:20.850> is<00:01:20.880> one<00:01:21.330> it's<00:01:21.540> not

00:01:21.649 --> 00:01:21.659 
satin version but black is one it's not

00:01:21.659 --> 00:01:23.960 
satin version but black is one it's not
going<00:01:21.750> to<00:01:21.840> be<00:01:21.930> so<00:01:22.049> reflective<00:01:22.729> if<00:01:23.729> that

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:23.970 
going to be so reflective if that

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:26.359 
going to be so reflective if that
matters<00:01:24.299> too<00:01:24.540> but<00:01:25.049> more<00:01:25.500> realistically<00:01:25.710> it's

00:01:26.359 --> 00:01:26.369 
matters too but more realistically it's

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:28.330 
matters too but more realistically it's
more<00:01:26.640> rust<00:01:26.939> resistant<00:01:27.540> than<00:01:27.630> a<00:01:27.720> satin<00:01:28.049> finish

00:01:28.330 --> 00:01:28.340 
more rust resistant than a satin finish

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:31.700 
more rust resistant than a satin finish
