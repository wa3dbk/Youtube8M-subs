00:00:00.649 --> 00:00:03.649
 that's a kind of world 

00:00:04.730 --> 00:00:07.760
 because he had the luck on his side the ee for 

00:00:07.760 --> 00:00:10.559
 because her mother glass eric m 

00:00:10.559 --> 00:00:12.989
 but because he was ambitious 

00:00:12.989 --> 00:00:15.989
 to do this 

00:00:27.199 --> 00:00:28.150
 for the future 

00:00:28.150 --> 00:00:31.150
 the latter continues 

00:01:15.580 --> 00:01:17.330
 pay attention 

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:20.530
 yes but nice as he is so I would sometimes be different about it 

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:31.940
 this year 

00:01:46.220 --> 00:01:49.220
 63 

00:02:01.620 --> 00:02:02.680
 to this 

00:02:02.680 --> 00:02:05.680
 therefore not functioning 

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:09.469
 it is not easy to read those rules 

00:02:09.469 --> 00:02:13.069
 You would say I would be very nice if I were the first time in six weeks 

00:02:15.949 --> 00:02:18.949
 it can be done differently 

00:02:34.009 --> 00:02:37.009
 Thursday treats 

00:02:38.149 --> 00:02:41.149
 the Swiss 

00:02:41.819 --> 00:02:44.819
 what i was missing 

00:02:56.229 --> 00:02:59.229
 because all entrants 

00:03:25.899 --> 00:03:27.349
 which I like this about 

00:03:27.349 --> 00:03:30.349
 harvard 

00:03:34.859 --> 00:03:37.859
 sss 

00:03:41.859 --> 00:03:42.459
 that's part of it
