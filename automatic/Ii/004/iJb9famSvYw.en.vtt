00:00:09.880 --> 00:00:14.060
 So I wish you all good health, and we 

00:00:12.140 --> 00:00:14.750
 viewers and today we play tanks 

00:00:14.060 --> 00:00:19.340
 online 

00:00:14.750 --> 00:00:27.010
 and I'm back in the garage and I think today 

00:00:19.340 --> 00:00:27.010
 play on you mud vaspozhigiga 

00:00:27.130 --> 00:00:34.190
 so but let's go to the battle 

00:00:30.070 --> 00:00:37.180
 so I chose the silence card I stay with that 

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:37.180
 same combination and 

00:00:37.480 --> 00:00:45.260
 well on keels yes we already win that is 

00:00:41.920 --> 00:00:48.250
 61 although I have not made any because 

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:48.250
 that was just starting to shoot 

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:55.019
 here we see isida which is seen on 

00:00:50.969 --> 00:01:00.260
 recharge and it self destructs here 

00:00:55.019 --> 00:01:03.260
 another one of or is i killing the frieze 

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:03.260
 killed by 

00:01:03.940 --> 00:01:10.530
 and we lose nuclear power so 

00:01:06.700 --> 00:01:10.530
 say simple verka 

00:01:12.760 --> 00:01:15.960
 one more and worth 

00:01:23.010 --> 00:01:26.450
 try to kill me 

00:01:27.070 --> 00:01:35.040
 and down also burns out 

00:01:30.490 --> 00:01:37.350
 I'm in second place to 1 not far cool 

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:40.350
 destroyed four shot down once 

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:40.350
 cool 

00:01:40.690 --> 00:01:47.760
 so 

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:49.659
 aisha aisha bw this is his powerful 

00:01:47.760 --> 00:01:53.490
 combination 

00:01:49.659 --> 00:01:53.490
 Isis could receive medical treatment even now 

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:56.810
 yes no its types 

00:01:57.130 --> 00:02:02.219
 and there are 2 of which treats 

00:02:00.820 --> 00:02:05.350
 first captivity 

00:02:02.219 --> 00:02:08.220
 you can get confused easily 

00:02:05.350 --> 00:02:08.220
 found by ear 

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:17.010
 so we are not the second and not the first 

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:20.910
 guys i'm sorry i got sick so the voice 

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:23.160
 I will have a little different and in general 

00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:28.130
 as it will be other thoughts do not know well 

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:31.470
 in another way Iâ€™ll just say everything and 

00:02:28.130 --> 00:02:35.130
 I am here cleans the rails 0 

00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:38.060
 hornet m0 with a little call because 

00:02:35.130 --> 00:02:38.060
 I had a little hp 

00:02:40.460 --> 00:02:45.490
 Yes, she is worth it not to reach 

00:02:48.970 --> 00:02:54.010
 Well, let's shoot 

00:02:51.319 --> 00:02:54.010
 didn't kill 

00:02:54.520 --> 00:03:01.450
 Oh no 

00:02:56.990 --> 00:03:06.580
 I rolled over and I'm 4 in fourth place 

00:03:01.450 --> 00:03:12.370
 no in the third yes I'm in the third place and 

00:03:06.580 --> 00:03:18.790
 up to 2 not far from up to 3 years 1 

00:03:12.370 --> 00:03:18.790
 far as not much 

00:03:19.160 --> 00:03:22.090
 so here 

00:03:22.460 --> 00:03:26.140
 inadvertently throwing away isis 

00:03:27.870 --> 00:03:34.970
 and look here the rail is worth and shaft 

00:03:32.010 --> 00:03:34.970
 whose recharge 

00:03:37.120 --> 00:03:44.230
 but no, he is killing me and he is hardly ready 

00:03:40.720 --> 00:03:45.879
 It burns out because it will finish on I 

00:03:44.230 --> 00:03:50.709
 first place this is great this is me 

00:03:45.879 --> 00:03:51.780
 like so with this combination i'm bad 

00:03:50.709 --> 00:03:54.790
 playing 

00:03:51.780 --> 00:03:58.379
 well, bad enough so you don't 

00:03:54.790 --> 00:04:00.819
 Imagine soon how many duplicates 

00:03:58.379 --> 00:04:03.360
 because re-shoot re-shoot 

00:04:00.819 --> 00:04:03.360
 retake 

00:04:04.319 --> 00:04:12.780
 No, I was killed right now, I'm not the first but the second 

00:04:08.489 --> 00:04:15.230
 and accuracy is probably the third stan 

00:04:12.780 --> 00:04:15.230
 and ok 

00:04:15.360 --> 00:04:28.050
 we'll go do keels account with us 

00:04:20.609 --> 00:04:36.230
 cool 43 34 not already 44 34 and here 

00:04:28.050 --> 00:04:36.230
 shot we lightly set fire to the body 

00:04:36.320 --> 00:04:45.170
 so everyone finished off him more precisely we killed yeah 

00:04:47.650 --> 00:04:53.639
 well, well, let me treat me 

00:04:49.570 --> 00:04:53.639
 you will not work 

00:04:53.790 --> 00:04:59.940
 but sense she got cured of 

00:04:55.680 --> 00:05:04.680
 but not long since April from the rail 

00:04:59.940 --> 00:05:08.360
 rails kill rail about what here 

00:05:04.680 --> 00:05:12.879
 powerful titanium 

00:05:08.360 --> 00:05:12.879
 and everything is great for him 

00:05:14.139 --> 00:05:16.860
 i am 2 

00:05:17.139 --> 00:05:24.460
 and it would be nice if prezi then 

00:05:19.150 --> 00:05:28.259
 cure but then the rails killed me there 

00:05:24.460 --> 00:05:28.259
 crystals lying around ok 

00:05:29.070 --> 00:05:35.520
 I'll probably pick them up now 

00:05:32.080 --> 00:05:35.520
 yes i choose them 

00:05:35.710 --> 00:05:43.690
 30 crystals normally 3 drawers 

00:05:40.560 --> 00:05:46.230
 the game has just begun and almost 

00:05:43.690 --> 00:05:49.940
 ends and even increased background you 

00:05:46.230 --> 00:05:52.430
 only 500 more crystals 

00:05:49.940 --> 00:05:54.850
 632 crystals 

00:05:52.430 --> 00:05:54.850
 the fund 

00:05:54.980 --> 00:06:02.240
 So 

00:05:56.639 --> 00:06:02.240
 and over there shaft thunder gram shaft all 

00:06:06.750 --> 00:06:12.860
 so we all finish off his izida no, we are no longer 

00:06:10.410 --> 00:06:16.490
 we have time to find the mind 

00:06:12.860 --> 00:06:16.490
 him in second place 

00:06:17.920 --> 00:06:20.580
 tags 

00:06:21.950 --> 00:06:27.440
 the whole end was and we were given 103 crystals 

00:06:24.850 --> 00:06:31.790
 I said that the fights will be short but 

00:06:27.440 --> 00:06:34.400
 this one is too short ok yantru 

00:06:31.790 --> 00:06:38.120
 as you saw in the previous series I 

00:06:34.400 --> 00:06:40.850
 I will try to change so well who does not 

00:06:38.120 --> 00:06:41.360
 knows the intro is like starting 

00:06:40.850 --> 00:06:44.360
 a rabbit 

00:06:41.360 --> 00:06:46.600
 that started the rabbit sorry start 

00:06:44.360 --> 00:06:46.600
 roller 

00:06:46.610 --> 00:06:52.370
 here 

00:06:47.840 --> 00:06:55.699
 so I think you liked it was 

00:06:52.370 --> 00:06:58.400
 short but i think it was the last one 

00:06:55.699 --> 00:07:02.139
 short fight sign up 

00:06:58.400 --> 00:07:02.139
