00:01:30.929 --> 00:01:30.939 
composition and the base layout we have

00:01:30.939 --> 00:01:33.899 
composition and the base layout we have
a<00:01:30.969> really<00:01:31.359> low<00:01:31.689> base<00:01:32.020> it<00:01:32.350> has<00:01:32.560> gold<00:01:32.979> walls

00:01:33.899 --> 00:01:33.909 
a really low base it has gold walls

00:01:33.909 --> 00:01:37.109 
a really low base it has gold walls
which<00:01:34.689> shouldn't<00:01:35.499> be<00:01:35.560> much<00:01:36.219> of<00:01:36.280> a<00:01:36.520> problem<00:01:36.549> he

00:01:37.109 --> 00:01:37.119 
which shouldn't be much of a problem he

00:01:37.119 --> 00:01:39.389 
which shouldn't be much of a problem he
has<00:01:37.270> some<00:01:37.509> Giants<00:01:38.049> and<00:01:38.229> resets<00:01:38.710> all<00:01:38.890> level<00:01:39.249> two

00:01:39.389 --> 00:01:39.399 
has some Giants and resets all level two

00:01:39.399 --> 00:01:42.419 
has some Giants and resets all level two
he<00:01:39.969> could<00:01:40.240> easily<00:01:40.450> go<00:01:41.020> in<00:01:41.170> on<00:01:41.350> to<00:01:41.679> star<00:01:42.039> if<00:01:42.219> not

00:01:42.419 --> 00:01:42.429 
he could easily go in on to star if not

00:01:42.429 --> 00:01:45.389 
he could easily go in on to star if not
three<00:01:42.850> started<00:01:43.389> base<00:01:43.630> I<00:01:43.990> guess<00:01:44.710> everyone

00:01:45.389 --> 00:01:45.399 
three started base I guess everyone

00:01:45.399 --> 00:01:48.510 
three started base I guess everyone
knows<00:01:45.670> how<00:01:45.909> to<00:01:45.939> attack<00:01:46.359> this<00:01:46.539> space<00:01:46.799> but<00:01:47.799> what

00:01:48.510 --> 00:01:48.520 
knows how to attack this space but what

00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:50.730 
knows how to attack this space but what
happened<00:01:48.969> he<00:01:49.090> got<00:01:49.240> three<00:01:49.509> percent<00:01:49.990> so<00:01:50.259> let's

00:01:50.730 --> 00:01:50.740 
happened he got three percent so let's

00:01:50.740 --> 00:01:56.399 
happened he got three percent so let's
