which you could traverse the environment
you<00:01:09.689> been<00:01:09.840> able<00:01:09.990> to<00:01:10.140> sort<00:01:10.500> of<00:01:10.590> tweak<00:01:11.159> the

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:11.310 
you been able to sort of tweak the

you been able to sort of tweak the
gameplay<00:01:11.729> or<00:01:11.760> expand<00:01:12.390> the<00:01:12.540> gameplay<00:01:12.930> because

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:13.200 
gameplay or expand the gameplay because

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:14.690 
gameplay or expand the gameplay because
you<00:01:13.500> have<00:01:13.890> a<00:01:13.920> lot<00:01:14.100> more<00:01:14.189> power<00:01:14.400> under<00:01:14.580> the

00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:14.700 
you have a lot more power under the

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:18.950 
you have a lot more power under the
under<00:01:15.360> the<00:01:15.450> hood<00:01:15.630> well<00:01:15.930> it<00:01:16.140> helps<00:01:16.830> us<00:01:17.960> really

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:18.960 
under the hood well it helps us really

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:21.170 
under the hood well it helps us really
adapt<00:01:19.320> where<00:01:20.280> you're<00:01:20.430> going<00:01:20.729> and<00:01:20.970> how<00:01:21.119> you

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:21.180 
adapt where you're going and how you

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:22.580 
adapt where you're going and how you
move<00:01:21.420> through<00:01:21.540> the<00:01:21.659> environment<00:01:22.259> because<00:01:22.500> we

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:22.590 
move through the environment because we

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:24.980 
move through the environment because we
can<00:01:22.740> actually<00:01:22.950> track<00:01:23.939> the<00:01:23.970> actual<00:01:24.570> physics<00:01:24.869> of

00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:24.990 
can actually track the actual physics of

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:27.170 
can actually track the actual physics of
the<00:01:25.080> environment<00:01:25.650> so<00:01:25.860> when<00:01:26.610> when<00:01:26.939> you<00:01:26.970> play

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:27.180 
the environment so when when you play

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:28.819 
the environment so when when you play
with<00:01:27.330> the<00:01:27.570> with<00:01:27.960> the<00:01:28.170> movement<00:01:28.380> in<00:01:28.619> the<00:01:28.680> game

00:01:28.819 --> 00:01:28.829 
with the with the movement in the game

00:01:28.829 --> 00:01:30.260 
with the with the movement in the game
whether<00:01:29.009> it's<00:01:29.250> a<00:01:29.369> smoke<00:01:29.640> dash<00:01:29.850> that<00:01:30.090> we've

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:30.270 
whether it's a smoke dash that we've

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:32.539 
whether it's a smoke dash that we've
been<00:01:30.390> showing<00:01:30.630> a<00:01:30.840> lot<00:01:31.020> of<00:01:31.079> that<00:01:32.070> actually<00:01:32.250> is

00:01:32.539 --> 00:01:32.549 
been showing a lot of that actually is

00:01:32.549 --> 00:01:34.219 
been showing a lot of that actually is
based<00:01:32.759> on<00:01:32.939> the<00:01:33.270> physics<00:01:33.570> of<00:01:33.659> the<00:01:33.780> game<00:01:33.960> we<00:01:34.110> can

00:01:34.219 --> 00:01:34.229 
based on the physics of the game we can

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:36.080 
based on the physics of the game we can
actually<00:01:34.530> analyze<00:01:34.740> it<00:01:35.220> in<00:01:35.250> real<00:01:35.549> time<00:01:35.579> and

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:36.090 
actually analyze it in real time and

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:37.940 
actually analyze it in real time and
have<00:01:36.270> you<00:01:36.509> move<00:01:36.780> over<00:01:37.020> things<00:01:37.439> or<00:01:37.740> through

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:37.950 
have you move over things or through

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:39.830 
have you move over things or through
things<00:01:38.250> again<00:01:39.000> would<00:01:39.210> have<00:01:39.299> been<00:01:39.390> hard<00:01:39.570> for<00:01:39.659> us

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:39.840 
things again would have been hard for us

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:40.730 
things again would have been hard for us
to<00:01:39.869> do<00:01:40.110> that<00:01:40.200> we<00:01:40.320> just<00:01:40.350> didn't<00:01:40.590> have<00:01:40.619> enough

00:01:40.730 --> 00:01:40.740 
to do that we just didn't have enough

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:42.289 
to do that we just didn't have enough
processing<00:01:41.040> power<00:01:41.369> to<00:01:41.640> do<00:01:41.729> that<00:01:41.759> on<00:01:42.000> ps3

00:01:42.289 --> 00:01:42.299 
processing power to do that on ps3

00:01:42.299 --> 00:01:44.210 
processing power to do that on ps3
obviously<00:01:43.079> things<00:01:43.200> fall<00:01:43.470> apart<00:01:43.500> in<00:01:43.950> the<00:01:43.979> game

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:44.220 
obviously things fall apart in the game

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:45.590 
obviously things fall apart in the game
as<00:01:44.369> well<00:01:44.549> and<00:01:44.820> I<00:01:44.880> you<00:01:45.090> can<00:01:45.240> see<00:01:45.360> there's<00:01:45.540> a

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:45.600 
as well and I you can see there's a

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:47.210 
as well and I you can see there's a
temptation<00:01:45.840> like<00:01:46.290> let's<00:01:46.680> make<00:01:46.740> everything<00:01:47.040> to

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:47.220 
temptation like let's make everything to

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:48.440 
temptation like let's make everything to
struggle<00:01:47.549> it's<00:01:47.670> how<00:01:47.729> much<00:01:47.970> bigger<00:01:48.210> map

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:48.450 
struggle it's how much bigger map

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:50.840 
struggle it's how much bigger map
because<00:01:48.990> you<00:01:49.170> can<00:01:49.470> but<00:01:49.740> what's<00:01:50.340> the<00:01:50.490> process

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:50.850 
because you can but what's the process

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:52.069 
because you can but what's the process
of<00:01:50.939> trying<00:01:51.149> to<00:01:51.240> find<00:01:51.450> that<00:01:51.570> sweet<00:01:51.750> spot<00:01:51.899> of

00:01:52.069 --> 00:01:52.079 
of trying to find that sweet spot of

00:01:52.079 --> 00:01:53.840 
of trying to find that sweet spot of
balance<00:01:52.710> so<00:01:52.860> you<00:01:52.920> can<00:01:53.070> impress<00:01:53.340> the<00:01:53.490> player<00:01:53.670> by

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:53.850 
balance so you can impress the player by

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:55.100 
balance so you can impress the player by
having<00:01:54.090> new<00:01:54.210> shiny<00:01:54.479> things<00:01:54.780> and<00:01:54.869> bigger

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:55.110 
having new shiny things and bigger

00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:57.170 
having new shiny things and bigger
things<00:01:55.439> yeah<00:01:55.710> but<00:01:56.100> not<00:01:56.280> make<00:01:56.549> it<00:01:56.729> so<00:01:57.000> much<00:01:57.119> so

00:01:57.170 --> 00:01:57.180 
things yeah but not make it so much so

00:01:57.180 --> 00:01:58.340 
things yeah but not make it so much so
that<00:01:57.329> actually<00:01:57.780> isn't<00:01:57.899> fun<00:01:58.140> to<00:01:58.229> play

00:01:58.340 --> 00:01:58.350 
that actually isn't fun to play

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:00.800 
that actually isn't fun to play
absolutely<00:01:59.100> and<00:01:59.490> for<00:01:59.579> us<00:01:59.939> I<00:02:00.119> think<00:02:00.149> particle

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:00.810 
absolutely and for us I think particle

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:02.719 
absolutely and for us I think particle
is<00:02:00.899> branding<00:02:01.350> really<00:02:01.740> when<00:02:02.280> you<00:02:02.399> look<00:02:02.430> in<00:02:02.640> the

00:02:02.719 --> 00:02:02.729 
is branding really when you look in the

00:02:02.729 --> 00:02:04.370 
is branding really when you look in the
game<00:02:02.939> a<00:02:03.210> lot<00:02:03.719> of<00:02:03.869> the<00:02:03.960> stuff<00:02:04.170> that's

00:02:04.370 --> 00:02:04.380 
game a lot of the stuff that's

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:07.010 
game a lot of the stuff that's
destructible<00:02:05.009> it<00:02:05.880> has<00:02:06.299> been<00:02:06.450> put<00:02:06.630> there<00:02:06.810> it's

00:02:07.010 --> 00:02:07.020 
destructible it has been put there it's

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:08.869 
destructible it has been put there it's
been<00:02:07.200> added<00:02:07.680> on<00:02:07.799> to<00:02:08.009> Seattle<00:02:08.220> scale<00:02:08.580> has<00:02:08.759> been

00:02:08.869 --> 00:02:08.879 
been added on to Seattle scale has been

00:02:08.879 --> 00:02:10.800 
been added on to Seattle scale has been
kind<00:02:09.060> of<00:02:09.179> turned<00:02:09.390> into<00:02:09.660> an<00:02:09.750> armed<00:02:10.050> camp<00:02:10.110> by<00:02:10.619> the

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:10.810 
kind of turned into an armed camp by the

00:02:10.810 --> 00:02:12.300 
kind of turned into an armed camp by the
government<00:02:11.230> agency<00:02:11.680> is<00:02:11.800> trying<00:02:11.830> to<00:02:12.099> track

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:12.310 
government agency is trying to track

00:02:12.310 --> 00:02:13.830 
government agency is trying to track
down<00:02:12.340> all<00:02:12.670> the<00:02:12.760> people<00:02:13.000> with<00:02:13.120> superpowers<00:02:13.270> and

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:13.840 
down all the people with superpowers and

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:15.930 
down all the people with superpowers and
their<00:02:14.470> stuff<00:02:14.709> tends<00:02:15.040> to<00:02:15.099> be<00:02:15.250> destructible<00:02:15.819> so

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:15.940 
their stuff tends to be destructible so

00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:17.460 
their stuff tends to be destructible so
as<00:02:16.060> the<00:02:16.209> player<00:02:16.390> it's<00:02:16.540> very<00:02:16.690> predictable<00:02:17.260> when

00:02:17.460 --> 00:02:17.470 
as the player it's very predictable when

00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:18.540 
as the player it's very predictable when
you<00:02:17.560> look<00:02:17.680> through<00:02:17.800> the<00:02:17.950> city<00:02:18.160> if<00:02:18.280> you<00:02:18.370> see

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:18.550 
you look through the city if you see

00:02:18.550 --> 00:02:20.250 
you look through the city if you see
stuff<00:02:18.819> that<00:02:18.970> has<00:02:19.120> this<00:02:19.330> sort<00:02:19.510> of<00:02:19.630> gray<00:02:19.989> and

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:20.260 
stuff that has this sort of gray and

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:22.500 
stuff that has this sort of gray and
yellow<00:02:20.500> branding<00:02:21.430> on<00:02:21.580> it<00:02:21.760> you<00:02:22.209> know<00:02:22.330> you're

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:22.510 
yellow branding on it you know you're

00:02:22.510 --> 00:02:23.820 
yellow branding on it you know you're
gonna<00:02:22.569> be<00:02:22.690> able<00:02:22.810> to<00:02:22.930> knock<00:02:23.110> that<00:02:23.140> down<00:02:23.500> and<00:02:23.709> if

00:02:23.820 --> 00:02:23.830 
gonna be able to knock that down and if

00:02:23.830 --> 00:02:25.110 
gonna be able to knock that down and if
one<00:02:23.950> of<00:02:23.980> the<00:02:24.099> bad<00:02:24.220> guys<00:02:24.250> is<00:02:24.580> dumb<00:02:24.790> enough<00:02:24.819> to

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:25.120 
one of the bad guys is dumb enough to

00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:26.970 
one of the bad guys is dumb enough to
stand<00:02:25.330> on<00:02:25.480> top<00:02:25.690> well<00:02:25.989> that's<00:02:26.470> easy<00:02:26.650> way<00:02:26.920> to

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:26.980 
stand on top well that's easy way to

00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:29.400 
stand on top well that's easy way to
take<00:02:27.220> them<00:02:27.340> out<00:02:27.459> um<00:02:27.819> obviously<00:02:28.720> it<00:02:29.140> being<00:02:29.319> an

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:29.410 
take them out um obviously it being an

00:02:29.410 --> 00:02:31.380 
take them out um obviously it being an
infamous<00:02:29.709> game<00:02:29.890> you<00:02:30.220> can<00:02:30.400> be<00:02:30.550> a<00:02:30.730> good<00:02:30.970> guy<00:02:31.120> that

00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:31.390 
infamous game you can be a good guy that

00:02:31.390 --> 00:02:34.320 
infamous game you can be a good guy that
would<00:02:31.750> be<00:02:31.870> far<00:02:32.590> less<00:02:32.620> than<00:02:32.890> a<00:02:32.980> good<00:02:33.130> guy<00:02:33.280> um<00:02:33.550> how

00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:34.330 
would be far less than a good guy um how

00:02:34.330 --> 00:02:35.850 
would be far less than a good guy um how
have<00:02:34.480> you<00:02:34.569> started<00:02:34.810> to<00:02:34.989> play<00:02:35.260> with<00:02:35.500> that<00:02:35.650> I

00:02:35.850 --> 00:02:35.860 
have you started to play with that I

00:02:35.860 --> 00:02:37.860 
have you started to play with that I
would<00:02:35.950> see<00:02:36.040> that<00:02:36.190> that<00:02:36.519> kind<00:02:36.730> of<00:02:36.819> binary<00:02:37.450> good

00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:37.870 
would see that that kind of binary good

00:02:37.870 --> 00:02:39.690 
would see that that kind of binary good
bad<00:02:38.080> you<00:02:38.709> guys<00:02:38.860> were<00:02:39.010> one<00:02:39.190> of<00:02:39.220> the<00:02:39.370> first<00:02:39.489> ones

00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:39.700 
bad you guys were one of the first ones

00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:41.400 
bad you guys were one of the first ones
out<00:02:39.760> of<00:02:39.910> the<00:02:39.970> gate<00:02:40.120> doing<00:02:40.420> that<00:02:40.599> it<00:02:41.260> is<00:02:41.380> a

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:41.410 
out of the gate doing that it is a

00:02:41.410 --> 00:02:44.400 
out of the gate doing that it is a
fairly<00:02:42.390> unremarkable<00:02:43.390> aspect<00:02:44.110> a<00:02:44.170> lot<00:02:44.200> of

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:44.410 
fairly unremarkable aspect a lot of

00:02:44.410 --> 00:02:45.690

there I think there's more after that as

00:05:19.229 --> 00:05:21.440 
there I think there's more after that as
well<00:05:19.410> as<00:05:20.100> a<00:05:20.160> player<00:05:20.400> you<00:05:20.580> get<00:05:20.700> experience<00:05:21.300> out

00:05:21.450 --> 00:05:23.450 
well as a player you get experience out
a<00:05:21.870> bunch<00:05:22.200> of<00:05:22.350> different<00:05:22.650> playstyles<00:05:22.860> as<00:05:23.340> you

00:05:23.450 --> 00:05:23.460 
a bunch of different playstyles as you

00:05:23.460 --> 00:05:25.580 
a bunch of different playstyles as you
move<00:05:23.610> from<00:05:23.760> power<00:05:24.000> set<00:05:24.270> to<00:05:24.389> power<00:05:24.570> set<00:05:24.810> is<00:05:25.020> the

00:05:25.580 --> 00:05:25.590 
move from power set to power set is the

00:05:25.590 --> 00:05:26.840 
move from power set to power set is the
idea<00:05:25.800> that<00:05:25.860> would<00:05:26.040> you<00:05:26.160> require<00:05:26.370> power<00:05:26.639> you

it a game like infamous where it's got

00:06:01.889 --> 00:06:04.610

00:06:04.610 --> 00:06:04.620 
this open feel to it and yet it has this

00:06:04.620 --> 00:06:06.800 
this open feel to it and yet it has this
really<00:06:04.860> high<00:06:05.220> quality<00:06:05.250> linear<00:06:06.180> experience<00:06:06.510> at

00:06:06.800 --> 00:06:06.810 
really high quality linear experience at

00:06:06.810 --> 00:06:08.210

the same time and that's a challenge

00:06:08.220 --> 00:06:10.190 
the same time and that's a challenge
because<00:06:08.729> the<00:06:09.479> players<00:06:09.660> aren't<00:06:09.960> predictable

00:06:10.190 --> 00:06:10.200
