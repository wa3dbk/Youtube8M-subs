00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:38.250 
are the things that I look for I've got

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:40.670 
are the things that I look for I've got
some<00:00:38.430> cabbage<00:00:38.640> here<00:00:39.059> a<00:00:39.270> head<00:00:39.840> of<00:00:40.050> cabbage<00:00:40.290> I

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:40.680 
some cabbage here a head of cabbage I

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:43.190 
some cabbage here a head of cabbage I
should<00:00:40.890> say<00:00:41.070> and<00:00:41.340> I<00:00:41.399> have<00:00:41.579> 1/2<00:00:41.850> and<00:00:42.149> 1/4<00:00:42.420> and<00:00:42.930> we

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:43.200 
should say and I have 1/2 and 1/4 and we

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:45.560 
should say and I have 1/2 and 1/4 and we
Illustrated<00:00:43.829> to<00:00:44.040> you<00:00:44.070> are<00:00:44.700> demonstrated<00:00:45.450> in

00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:45.570 
Illustrated to you are demonstrated in

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:48.740 
Illustrated to you are demonstrated in
another<00:00:45.870> video<00:00:46.200> of<00:00:46.590> how<00:00:47.520> to<00:00:47.579> remove<00:00:48.270> the<00:00:48.480> core

00:00:48.740 --> 00:00:48.750 
another video of how to remove the core

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:51.340 
another video of how to remove the core
so<00:00:49.500> this<00:00:49.649> is<00:00:49.829> the<00:00:49.950> half<00:00:50.190> and<00:00:50.550> we<00:00:50.700> cut<00:00:50.940> obviously

00:00:51.340 --> 00:00:51.350 
so this is the half and we cut obviously

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:54.200 
so this is the half and we cut obviously
the<00:00:52.350> 1/2<00:00:52.559> into<00:00:53.309> another<00:00:53.579> half<00:00:53.820> and<00:00:54.090> got<00:00:54.149> a

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:54.210 
the 1/2 into another half and got a

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:54.740 
the 1/2 into another half and got a
quarter

00:00:54.740 --> 00:00:54.750 
quarter

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:57.619 
quarter
so<00:00:55.289> we've<00:00:55.440> exposed<00:00:55.860> the<00:00:56.070> the<00:00:56.640> core<00:00:56.910> here<00:00:57.149> and

00:00:57.619 --> 00:00:57.629 
so we've exposed the the core here and

00:00:57.629 --> 00:00:59.119 
so we've exposed the the core here and
I'm<00:00:57.840> going<00:00:57.989> to<00:00:58.020> go<00:00:58.170> ahead<00:00:58.410> and<00:00:58.530> take<00:00:58.710> this<00:00:58.920> out

00:00:59.119 --> 00:00:59.129 
I'm going to go ahead and take this out

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:01.790 
I'm going to go ahead and take this out
and<00:01:00.120> I<00:01:00.180> like<00:01:00.359> just<00:01:00.390> making<00:01:00.930> a<00:01:01.020> V<00:01:01.199> cut<00:01:01.469> on<00:01:01.620> each

00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:01.800 
and I like just making a V cut on each

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:11.870 
and I like just making a V cut on each
side<00:01:03.439> to<00:01:04.439> remove<00:01:04.769> this<00:01:09.560> so<00:01:10.560> that's<00:01:10.740> that<00:01:10.979> all

00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:11.880 
side to remove this so that's that all

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:15.710 
side to remove this so that's that all
gone<00:01:13.130> and<00:01:14.130> I've<00:01:14.310> already<00:01:14.520> adjusted<00:01:15.210> my<00:01:15.360> blade

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:15.720 
gone and I've already adjusted my blade

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:22.550 
gone and I've already adjusted my blade
on<00:01:16.110> the<00:01:17.390> mandolin<00:01:20.570> and<00:01:21.570> the<00:01:22.110> blade<00:01:22.320> that<00:01:22.439> I'm

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:22.560 
on the mandolin and the blade that I'm

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:24.950 
on the mandolin and the blade that I'm
talking<00:01:23.009> about<00:01:23.130> is<00:01:23.490> right<00:01:23.790> here<00:01:24.390> and<00:01:24.570> you

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:24.960 
talking about is right here and you

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:26.690 
talking about is right here and you
adjust<00:01:25.290> the<00:01:25.470> height<00:01:25.650> of<00:01:25.920> it<00:01:26.070> based<00:01:26.250> on<00:01:26.460> how

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:26.700 
adjust the height of it based on how

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:29.120 
adjust the height of it based on how
thin<00:01:27.180> or<00:01:27.450> thick<00:01:27.479> you<00:01:28.049> want<00:01:28.200> your<00:01:28.350> cuts<00:01:28.710> to<00:01:28.979> be

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:29.130 
thin or thick you want your cuts to be

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:31.039 
thin or thick you want your cuts to be
and<00:01:29.490> you<00:01:29.610> use<00:01:29.820> to<00:01:30.060> this<00:01:30.180> machine<00:01:30.780> for<00:01:30.930> all

00:01:31.039 --> 00:01:31.049 
and you use to this machine for all

00:01:31.049 --> 00:01:32.960 
and you use to this machine for all
different<00:01:31.409> kinds<00:01:31.650> of<00:01:31.770> vegetables<00:01:32.220> so<00:01:32.400> I've

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:32.970 
different kinds of vegetables so I've

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:35.359 
different kinds of vegetables so I've
got<00:01:33.119> a<00:01:33.150> really<00:01:33.479> shallow<00:01:33.950> setting<00:01:34.950> on<00:01:35.130> the

00:01:35.359 --> 00:01:35.369 
got a really shallow setting on the

00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:37.340 
got a really shallow setting on the
knife<00:01:35.549> and<00:01:35.790> this<00:01:36.240> is<00:01:36.420> the<00:01:36.509> ramp<00:01:36.750> that<00:01:36.869> the<00:01:37.110> food

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:37.350 
knife and this is the ramp that the food

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:39.080 
knife and this is the ramp that the food
will<00:01:37.530> be<00:01:37.650> fed<00:01:37.890> down<00:01:38.130> onto<00:01:38.579> and<00:01:38.820> just<00:01:38.970> be

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:39.090 
will be fed down onto and just be

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:41.719 
will be fed down onto and just be
careful<00:01:39.270> with<00:01:39.509> your<00:01:39.659> fingers<00:01:40.490> heading<00:01:41.490> toward

00:01:41.719 --> 00:01:41.729 
careful with your fingers heading toward

00:01:41.729 --> 00:01:44.090 
careful with your fingers heading toward
that<00:01:41.850> open<00:01:42.180> blade<00:01:42.560> so<00:01:43.560> again<00:01:43.799> I've<00:01:43.890> got<00:01:44.040> a

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:44.100 
that open blade so again I've got a

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:46.069 
that open blade so again I've got a
really<00:01:44.310> shallow<00:01:44.640> setting<00:01:45.210> so<00:01:45.689> that<00:01:45.720> we<00:01:45.930> can

00:01:46.069 --> 00:01:46.079 
really shallow setting so that we can

00:01:46.079 --> 00:01:47.899 
really shallow setting so that we can
just<00:01:46.229> get<00:01:46.380> a<00:01:46.439> nice<00:01:46.710> fine<00:01:47.009> shred<00:01:47.340> out<00:01:47.670> of<00:01:47.759> this

00:01:47.899 --> 00:01:47.909 
just get a nice fine shred out of this

00:01:47.909 --> 00:01:51.139 
just get a nice fine shred out of this
so<00:01:48.540> I've<00:01:48.899> got<00:01:49.320> squared<00:01:49.799> sides<00:01:50.430> on<00:01:50.759> each<00:01:50.909> side

00:01:51.139 --> 00:01:51.149 
so I've got squared sides on each side

00:01:51.149 --> 00:01:52.789 
so I've got squared sides on each side
so<00:01:51.420> it's<00:01:51.570> a<00:01:51.630> little<00:01:51.840> bit<00:01:51.960> safer<00:01:52.140> to<00:01:52.409> push<00:01:52.590> down

00:01:52.789 --> 00:01:52.799 
so it's a little bit safer to push down

00:01:52.799 --> 00:01:55.700 
so it's a little bit safer to push down
this<00:01:52.950> ramp<00:01:53.250> toward<00:01:53.579> that<00:01:53.700> sharp<00:01:54.030> knife<00:01:54.710> and

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:55.710 
this ramp toward that sharp knife and

00:01:55.710 --> 00:01:58.520 
this ramp toward that sharp knife and
I'm<00:01:55.860> just<00:01:55.890> going<00:01:56.189> to<00:01:56.689> break<00:01:57.689> it<00:01:57.840> across<00:01:58.140> there

00:01:58.520 --> 00:01:58.530 
I'm just going to break it across there

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:01.910 
I'm just going to break it across there
and<00:01:59.689> as<00:02:00.689> you<00:02:00.869> can<00:02:01.049> tell<00:02:01.259> this<00:02:01.469> is<00:02:01.649> much<00:02:01.890> faster

00:02:01.910 --> 00:02:01.920 
and as you can tell this is much faster

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:05.510 
and as you can tell this is much faster
than<00:02:02.610> using<00:02:02.790> the<00:02:03.060> knife<00:02:03.420> a<00:02:03.930> little<00:02:04.520> more

00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:05.520 
than using the knife a little more

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:09.969 
than using the knife a little more
convenient<00:02:06.119> as<00:02:06.240> far<00:02:06.450> as<00:02:06.570> that<00:02:06.719> goes<00:02:08.420> ok

00:02:09.969 --> 00:02:09.979 
convenient as far as that goes ok

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:12.400 
convenient as far as that goes ok
so<00:02:10.099> I've<00:02:10.220> just<00:02:10.250> shaved<00:02:10.670> off<00:02:10.849> a<00:02:11.209> little<00:02:12.140> and

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:12.410 
so I've just shaved off a little and

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:14.290 
so I've just shaved off a little and
I'll<00:02:12.560> move<00:02:12.800> this<00:02:13.069> off<00:02:13.310> to<00:02:13.520> the<00:02:13.610> side<00:02:13.819> and<00:02:14.090> show

00:02:14.290 --> 00:02:14.300 
I'll move this off to the side and show

00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:16.059 
I'll move this off to the side and show
you<00:02:14.360> the<00:02:14.569> finished<00:02:14.870> product<00:02:15.110> so<00:02:15.470> we've<00:02:15.860> got<00:02:16.040> a

00:02:16.059 --> 00:02:16.069

00:02:21.130 --> 00:02:21.140 
can use for coleslaw's we could braise

00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:24.430
