00:00:01.040 --> 00:00:04.040
 Klars system vehicle series 

00:00:06.850 --> 00:00:11.980
 a self-driver who has season all year round is the vehicle system 

00:00:11.980 --> 00:00:14.509
 series-a-round by Claas 

00:00:14.509 --> 00:00:19.530
 Two engines with 250 and 300 hp are available 

00:00:20.980 --> 00:00:26.750
 For the first time, the glass of its own wheel in the gearbox comes under continuous use 

00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:29.679
 Load works 

00:00:29.679 --> 00:00:34.080
 for saddling of the system constructions for booting sugar beets 

00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:39.190
 or to take a blockbuster tank piggyback consist of 3 construction and to 

00:00:39.190 --> 00:00:42.180
 disposal 

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:45.540
 The Xerion can get up to 20 tons 

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:52.210
 at the HEC Hydraulik it carries ten tons in front is relieving of 5 tons 

00:00:52.210 --> 00:00:53.760
 possible 

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:59.050
 In addition come to the movies drives on the front and rear and in addition to the toboggan 

00:00:59.050 --> 00:01:01.130
 use up 

00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:04.530
 The large matured chassis is located in front and behind 

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:07.750
 Claas 

00:01:07.750 --> 00:01:10.750
 clear stepless transmission 

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:17.410
 with the in-house developed gearbox also made it clear that 

00:01:17.410 --> 00:01:21.570
 the course towards hydrostatic mechanical Leistungsverweigerer 

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:23.240
 drives 

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:25.580
 in the system vehicle of the region 

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:29.870
 Picture the new HM drive unit the first time moving into practice 

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:35.970
 As before engine, the performance with the Bambi gear comes in an office 

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:36.759
 Slavic 

00:01:36.759 --> 00:01:39.859
 and split a mechanical power branch 

00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:44.760
 a double planetary set then guided the powertrains 

00:01:44.760 --> 00:01:46.430
 together again 

00:01:46.430 --> 00:01:51.010
 the hydraulic adjustment range and thus the data covered by the virus 

00:01:51.010 --> 00:01:54.800
 Claas Klein explains the efficiency ratio in terms of efficiency 

00:02:01.610 --> 00:02:05.880
 that was in gear is fully capable of two ways and for both directions of travel 

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:07.620
 equally usable
