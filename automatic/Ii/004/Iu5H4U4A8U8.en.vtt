display<00:00:33.780> brightness<00:00:34.770> and<00:00:35.930> brightness<00:00:36.930> so<00:00:37.770> you

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:37.860 
display brightness and brightness so you

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:39.410 
display brightness and brightness so you

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:11.310 
there is a bit of flick on the galaxy s4

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:12.350 
there is a bit of flick on the galaxy s4
and<00:01:11.430> that's<00:01:11.580> just<00:01:11.729> due<00:01:11.939> to<00:01:11.970> the<00:01:12.210> way<00:01:12.330> the

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:12.360 
and that's just due to the way the

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:14.330 
and that's just due to the way the
technologies<00:01:13.020> used<00:01:13.140> it<00:01:13.890> doesn't<00:01:14.159> like<00:01:14.250> to

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:14.340 
technologies used it doesn't like to

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:16.640 
technologies used it doesn't like to
look<00:01:14.460> like<00:01:14.670> that<00:01:14.850> in<00:01:14.970> person<00:01:15.350> again<00:01:16.350> he's

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:16.650 
look like that in person again he's

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:19.039 
look like that in person again he's
probably<00:01:16.979> a<00:01:17.100> lot<00:01:17.759> of<00:01:17.820> viewing<00:01:18.000> angles<00:01:18.299> general

00:01:19.039 --> 00:01:19.049 
probably a lot of viewing angles general

00:01:19.049 --> 00:01:21.320 
probably a lot of viewing angles general
look<00:01:19.170> a<00:01:19.290> lot<00:01:19.500> better<00:01:19.680> on<00:01:19.950> the<00:01:20.159> galaxy<00:01:20.580> s4<00:01:20.939> the

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:21.330 
look a lot better on the galaxy s4 the

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:22.460 
look a lot better on the galaxy s4 the
viewing<00:01:21.600> was<00:01:21.750> actually<00:01:21.960> on<00:01:22.020> this<00:01:22.140> far<00:01:22.320> are

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:22.470 
viewing was actually on this far are

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:24.560 
viewing was actually on this far are
pretty<00:01:22.799> damn<00:01:22.890> impressive<00:01:23.310> probably<00:01:24.270> from<00:01:24.390> oh

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:24.570 
pretty damn impressive probably from oh

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:26.740 
pretty damn impressive probably from oh
maybe<00:01:24.930> even<00:01:25.170> more<00:01:25.350> impressed<00:01:25.650> in<00:01:25.770> the<00:01:25.860> HTC<00:01:26.340> one

00:01:26.740 --> 00:01:26.750 
maybe even more impressed in the HTC one

00:01:26.750 --> 00:01:30.499 
maybe even more impressed in the HTC one
so<00:01:27.750> was<00:01:28.229> a<00:01:28.259> zoom-in<00:01:29.100> will<00:01:29.460> zoom<00:01:29.729> in<00:01:29.909> and<00:01:30.119> again

00:01:30.499 --> 00:01:30.509 
so was a zoom-in will zoom in and again

00:01:30.509 --> 00:01:32.690 
so was a zoom-in will zoom in and again
the<00:01:30.600> bonfire<00:01:31.049> at<00:01:31.170> fifty<00:01:31.470> percent<00:01:31.740> saw<00:01:31.979> now<00:01:32.640> you

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:32.700 
the bonfire at fifty percent saw now you

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:34.190 
the bonfire at fifty percent saw now you
can<00:01:32.939> tell<00:01:33.150> the<00:01:33.270> difference<00:01:33.450> between<00:01:33.630> them

00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:34.200 
can tell the difference between them

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:38.149 
can tell the difference between them
hope<00:01:34.439> fuller<00:01:35.329> there<00:01:36.329> we<00:01:36.479> go<00:01:36.710> zoom<00:01:37.710> back<00:01:37.890> out<00:01:38.040> of

00:01:38.149 --> 00:01:38.159 
hope fuller there we go zoom back out of

00:01:38.159 --> 00:01:39.859 
hope fuller there we go zoom back out of
those<00:01:38.310> two<00:01:38.579> let's<00:01:38.909> go<00:01:39.090> to<00:01:39.150> the<00:01:39.299> next<00:01:39.420> one<00:01:39.689> and

00:01:39.859 --> 00:01:39.869 
those two let's go to the next one and
