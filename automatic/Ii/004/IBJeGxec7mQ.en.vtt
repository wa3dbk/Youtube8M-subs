00:00:45.850 --> 00:00:49.900
 the green tones or the green tones 

00:00:48.250 --> 00:00:53.250

00:00:49.900 --> 00:00:55.479

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:58.449
 dark to that several greens as they can 

00:00:55.479 --> 00:01:00.519

00:01:14.259 --> 00:01:19.030
 tonality of that green with his side 

00:01:16.360 --> 00:01:21.430
