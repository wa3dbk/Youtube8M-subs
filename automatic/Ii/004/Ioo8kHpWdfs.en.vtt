 ensure a good time every day 

00:00:06.420 --> 00:00:10.270
 A freight train accident on January 6 sets again the rail traffic on the 

00:00:10.270 --> 00:00:13.109
 route 

00:00:13.109 --> 00:00:16.109
 three wagons of a 20 biker wagon have risen 

00:00:16.689 --> 00:00:20.249
 until Spain falls way and the road on the railway just before the Portaner 

00:00:20.249 --> 00:00:22.289
 Station off the track 

00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:26.369
 the train slowed down so make it decent first 

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:28.160
 migratory 

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:29.960
 he stood immediately 

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:33.290
 more still morning five-groups at the formula we 

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:34.100
 three cars 

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:36.330
 off the track 

00:00:36.330 --> 00:00:37.600
 they were on board 

00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:40.600
 my front look 

00:00:41.920 --> 00:00:44.690
 in order to have to go back to rubble 

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:46.200
 and when we go there 

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:47.940
 Well, how much milder want to be 

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:51.130
 300 meters further to stand 

00:00:51.130 --> 00:00:54.490
 only a day before it was in Warendorf circle to a similar incident 

00:00:54.490 --> 00:00:55.560
 come 

00:00:55.560 --> 00:00:58.140
 many long-distance trains and had to be diverted 

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:01.610
 There were delays of up to an hour 

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:04.500
 Here, too, the important east-west axis affected 

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:07.670
 At Mindener station there were considerable delays 

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:08.460
 how about that 

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:11.440
 Luckily, the luckiest way is so far 

00:01:11.440 --> 00:01:14.890
 to support the salvage work was the Mindener local group of the 

00:01:14.890 --> 00:01:16.960
 technical relief agency on site 

00:01:16.960 --> 00:01:20.329
 says of the German railway informed that here all 

00:01:20.329 --> 00:01:23.250
 to be accompanied by a learning culture 

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:24.470
 strongly demanded 

00:01:24.470 --> 00:01:28.620
 Under the train is on a stretch of around $ with a glass and should percent 

00:01:28.620 --> 00:01:32.650
 You also be on something our task and we will now be with 8man 4 2 1 

00:01:32.650 --> 00:01:33.290
 percent 

00:01:33.290 --> 00:01:36.490
 Today the employment agency to illuminate the means the 5 work 

00:01:36.490 --> 00:01:37.690
 wants to procure 

00:01:37.690 --> 00:01:40.690
 and that is expected to last all night until dry in the morning 

00:01:41.620 --> 00:01:46.250
 during the salvage work there were train delays and outages 

00:01:46.250 --> 00:01:49.200
 for travelers from Bielefeld direction in LÃ¶hne was over 

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:52.640
 Long-distance trains in the direction of the Ruhr area were able to pass the accident site slowly 

00:01:53.370 --> 00:01:57.470
 others were redirected to orbital information about Paderborn and Altenbeken 

00:01:57.470 --> 00:02:00.490
 how long the impairments would last was unclear
