00:00:11.030 --> 00:00:18.750
 hello everybody and everyday life 

00:00:15.619 --> 00:00:19.529
 use some kind of lighting 

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:22.769
 instrumentation 

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:26.420
 some special devices in any 

00:00:22.769 --> 00:00:30.170
 case, all these devices are powered by 

00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:33.329
 what sources are usually 

00:00:30.170 --> 00:00:34.649
 I have a battery in 

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:38.670
 everyday life constantly 

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:41.370
 as a power supply for the lantern 

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:44.520
 used for example battery forms 

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:47.989
 factor 18,650 here is such 

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:52.860
 or similar they do not use 

00:00:47.989 --> 00:00:55.460
 batteries form factor 16 li 140 

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:58.430
 for example here such here 

00:00:55.460 --> 00:01:06.470
 form factor batteries are used 

00:00:58.430 --> 00:01:08.430
 2a or as they are also called finger and 

00:01:06.470 --> 00:01:14.640
 little fingers are used 

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:17.700
 or 3 but for example here such here and 

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:20.310
 the result of all this is pretty 

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:21.600
 intensive exploitation of all these 

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:23.610
 batteries 

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:27.180
 needs naturally arise 

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:28.799
 charging since the variety of these 

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:29.820
 battery life 

00:01:28.799 --> 00:01:33.090
 significant 

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:34.950
 well then how is it that for everyone 

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:38.310
 need to have your charger 

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:41.430
 this is inconvenient and inconvenient for several 

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:43.500
 reasons for this first 

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:46.350
 the device needs to pay money and 

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:48.930
 buy it secondly all these forks 

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:50.640
 outlet chargers which 

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:51.450
 constantly confused constantly somewhere 

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:54.060
 are lost 

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:55.969
 it is not convenient in terms of exactly 

00:01:54.060 --> 00:02:00.570
 such here household logistics 

00:01:55.969 --> 00:02:02.939
 so to charge all of these 

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:05.430
 battery I bought the so -called 

00:02:02.939 --> 00:02:07.680
 universal charger here 

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:08.989
 now I wanted to show you this 

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:11.410
 such a charger 

00:02:08.989 --> 00:02:15.360
 nightcore company 

00:02:11.410 --> 00:02:18.190
 the model is called oh 4 but so let's say it 

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:21.760
 On more heaped up option there is still 

00:02:18.190 --> 00:02:23.460
 oh 2 and differs only in that in 4 

00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:25.630
 charging at the same time 

00:02:23.460 --> 00:02:27.970
 respectively four different 

00:02:25.630 --> 00:02:30.870
 battery can be these battery 

00:02:27.970 --> 00:02:35.130
 by the way heterogeneous in type 

00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:38.620
 here he is only charged in oh 2 

00:02:35.130 --> 00:02:41.320
 Here is such a charger charger 

00:02:38.620 --> 00:02:42.730
 I have already used the device 

00:02:41.320 --> 00:02:45.400
 about a year that's pretty 

00:02:42.730 --> 00:02:47.020
 little time in every way 

00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:52.560
 positive emotions from his 

00:02:47.020 --> 00:02:52.560
 use comes here 

00:02:52.710 --> 00:02:55.710
 blister 

00:02:56.250 --> 00:02:59.250
 nightcore 

00:02:59.820 --> 00:03:08.020
 charger here any inscriptions to whom 

00:03:06.100 --> 00:03:14.400
 interesting you can pause and 

00:03:08.020 --> 00:03:17.760
 read and from this side so here with 

00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:20.830
 this side here and so on this side 

00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:23.350
 yes on the spokes of the specific battery 

00:03:20.830 --> 00:03:25.770
 who charge this device 

00:03:23.350 --> 00:03:30.900
 she is pretty much 

00:03:25.770 --> 00:03:41.110
 lithium-ion batteries 26 650 22 650 

00:03:30.900 --> 00:03:47.160
 18 650 17600 7018 490 17 517 350 16 140 

00:03:41.110 --> 00:03:49.270
 and our battery is 123 14 510 440 and 

00:03:47.160 --> 00:03:51.730
 nickel metal hydride or 

00:03:49.270 --> 00:03:53.830
 nickel cadmium battery forms 

00:03:51.730 --> 00:03:57.910
 factor two and three oisi 

00:03:53.830 --> 00:04:01.330
 that is, in principle, this charger 

00:03:57.910 --> 00:04:03.150
 the device covers all my needs 

00:04:01.330 --> 00:04:06.940
 completely 

00:04:03.150 --> 00:04:09.540
 it means that here is interesting here 

00:04:06.940 --> 00:04:13.150
 here is such a point label behind 

00:04:09.540 --> 00:04:15.550
 clearly not focus here again 

00:04:13.150 --> 00:04:17.010
 list of batteries that she can 

00:04:15.550 --> 00:04:21.549
 charge 

00:04:17.010 --> 00:04:26.170
 input voltage 110 or 220 to 240 

00:04:21.549 --> 00:04:28.360
 volt 50 hertz or at the entrance we can 

00:04:26.170 --> 00:04:30.340
 have 12 volts i.e. the device can 

00:04:28.360 --> 00:04:33.490
 eat both from household outlet and from 

00:04:30.340 --> 00:04:39.060
 car battery right here 

00:04:33.490 --> 00:04:43.930
 here from the upper end here is the entrance for 

00:04:39.060 --> 00:04:46.410
 sockets for 220 and input 12 volts from 

00:04:43.930 --> 00:04:50.650
 car battery 

00:04:46.410 --> 00:04:56.800
 farther out we have a maximum of 42 

00:04:50.650 --> 00:04:59.680
 volts, plus or minus 1 per cent 1 and 48 volts 

00:04:56.800 --> 00:05:04.630
 if we allow charging little fingers 

00:04:59.680 --> 00:05:05.760
 fingers plus minus one percent and we have 

00:05:04.630 --> 00:05:09.430
 charging current 

00:05:05.760 --> 00:05:13.510
 if we charge 4 batteries 

00:05:09.430 --> 00:05:17.320
 at the same time 3-4 rather so we have 

00:05:13.510 --> 00:05:19.480
 charging current 0 375 amps if 

00:05:17.320 --> 00:05:21.340
 charge one or two batteries then 

00:05:19.480 --> 00:05:26.410
 we have 072 

00:05:21.340 --> 00:05:28.960
 075 amperes per charge channel then 

00:05:26.410 --> 00:05:32.500
 there is so here it works 

00:05:28.960 --> 00:05:37.690
 charger well let's turn on 

00:05:32.500 --> 00:05:42.540
 Let's see this is a normal plug in a normal 

00:05:37.690 --> 00:05:47.080
 plugged in lit indicator 

00:05:42.540 --> 00:05:50.580
 power supply and about blinked so let's say 

00:05:47.080 --> 00:05:52.810
 tested here all four cells 

00:05:50.580 --> 00:05:54.940
 means how is the charging process 

00:05:52.810 --> 00:06:05.910
 here we just take everything 

00:05:54.940 --> 00:06:05.910
 battery for example 18:58 to 650 

00:06:07.770 --> 00:06:13.740
 here also went the process of charging this here 

00:06:11.290 --> 00:06:16.690
 carrying a single says that 

00:06:13.740 --> 00:06:18.400
 the battery is tested and here as 

00:06:16.690 --> 00:06:20.740
 how the battery is charging but 

00:06:18.400 --> 00:06:23.939
 In this case, it is almost full 

00:06:20.740 --> 00:06:27.909
 these three sectors have filled 

00:06:23.939 --> 00:06:32.249
 need to take let's say not at the same time 

00:06:27.909 --> 00:06:35.439
 turning off let's say charging on the first cell 

00:06:32.249 --> 00:06:38.379
 in the second there or in the third so that she does not 

00:06:35.439 --> 00:06:43.349
 warming up let's say battery 16 

00:06:38.379 --> 00:06:46.809
 340 here passes the testing process and 

00:06:43.349 --> 00:06:50.349
 then the process will go directly 

00:06:46.809 --> 00:06:53.499
 battery charging what can i say 

00:06:50.349 --> 00:06:55.569
 while using this charger 

00:06:53.499 --> 00:06:56.679
 I absolutely had no device 

00:06:55.569 --> 00:06:58.689
 no failures 

00:06:56.679 --> 00:07:01.719
 absolutely had no complaints about 

00:06:58.689 --> 00:07:06.309
 his work all works very well all 

00:07:01.719 --> 00:07:08.469
 works very well that is not 

00:07:06.309 --> 00:07:10.899
 there were no outsiders smells 

00:07:08.469 --> 00:07:15.399
 God forbid everything is wonderful everything is simple 

00:07:10.899 --> 00:07:17.289
 wonderful here and of course pleased 

00:07:15.399 --> 00:07:18.909
 pleased this versatility it 

00:07:17.289 --> 00:07:21.999
 device that is in one device we 

00:07:18.909 --> 00:07:26.669
 we have several charges at the same time 

00:07:21.999 --> 00:07:26.669
 let 's let's go in still 

00:07:27.509 --> 00:07:37.719
 little finger the only thing in it 

00:07:31.389 --> 00:07:40.569
 charger would like to 

00:07:37.719 --> 00:07:42.839
 was and he's not here is a function 

00:07:40.569 --> 00:07:45.039
 battery service that is 

00:07:42.839 --> 00:07:47.860
 forced discharge here this to 

00:07:45.039 --> 00:07:49.809
 Unfortunately, no, and if we allow for 

00:07:47.860 --> 00:07:51.939
 lithium ion batteries it 

00:07:49.809 --> 00:07:52.989
 uncritically they can be delayed at any time. 

00:07:51.939 --> 00:07:55.569
 time is absolutely 

00:07:52.989 --> 00:07:57.579
 then for nickel-cadmium and 

00:07:55.569 --> 00:08:00.249
 nickel metal hydride batteries 

00:07:57.579 --> 00:08:02.699
 it is very important they can only be charged 

00:08:00.249 --> 00:08:05.169
 after complete discharge but otherwise 

00:08:02.699 --> 00:08:09.099
 device days all very high quality 

00:08:05.169 --> 00:08:11.429
 I highly recommend everyone to everyone 

00:08:09.099 --> 00:08:11.429
 until
