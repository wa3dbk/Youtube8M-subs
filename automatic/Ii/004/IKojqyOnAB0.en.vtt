00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:27.890
 never 

00:00:29.860 --> 00:00:33.430
 hello my name is markus herrmann the 

00:00:31.420 --> 00:00:35.500
 short of it is professional I spend 

00:00:33.430 --> 00:00:35.980
 my time as internet heini of circus 

00:00:35.500 --> 00:00:38.080
 halli galli 

00:00:35.980 --> 00:00:39.670
 I felt like it was ten years ago 

00:00:38.080 --> 00:00:41.770
 Float 140 seconds and got it back then 

00:00:39.670 --> 00:00:43.390
 talked about flummis from there 

00:00:41.770 --> 00:00:45.340
 find it more interesting than family planning 

00:00:43.390 --> 00:00:46.840
 because my family is not 

00:00:45.340 --> 00:00:48.910
 has ensured that it thus with the 120th 

00:00:46.840 --> 00:00:50.200
 still not the human at my 

00:00:48.910 --> 00:00:51.730
 side has with you the future 

00:00:50.200 --> 00:00:53.470
 Together, I was there 

00:00:51.730 --> 00:00:57.270
 very quiet and so everything happened 

00:00:53.470 --> 00:00:57.270
 at some point and she worked there 

00:00:58.609 --> 00:01:05.909
 I am yes and yes later you will find 

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:07.110
 Attention to me first as a small x7 

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:08.520
 become because I hold his 

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:09.780
 twitter account knew and a block 

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:11.549
 then I'll have him up someday 

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:12.990
 first time written to facebook 

00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:15.030
 bit against it meant so rinner people 

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:16.409
 he does not know that personally 

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:17.330
 I do not like that but I have one 

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:19.290
 exception made 

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:21.060
 that went very long and I believe if 

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:22.440
 you write five months and and 

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:23.759
 then it should be clear that you 

00:01:22.440 --> 00:01:25.310
 find each other good because otherwise 

00:01:23.759 --> 00:01:27.000
 that's a bit weird and 

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:28.500
 deliver accordingly well and so 

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:30.210
 so we had luckily none 

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:32.520
 big difference between between 

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:36.240
 So you say online reality and real 

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:39.360
 Reality The engagement came after one 

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:41.640
 be together after one year then because 

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:43.530
 it somehow fits for me then 

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:45.149
 as a logical next step 

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:47.190
 It's nice to be such a point 

00:01:45.149 --> 00:01:48.990
 where nothing is engaged anymore what is where you 

00:01:47.190 --> 00:01:50.399
 Fear of it, you just think it is 

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:52.080
 such a next step as that 

00:01:50.399 --> 00:01:53.159
 most important thing you realize that you one 

00:01:52.080 --> 00:01:54.659
 good relationship for the acute 

00:01:53.159 --> 00:01:56.429
 friendship is generally that one 

00:01:54.659 --> 00:01:58.790
 can be silent together and that is without 

00:01:56.429 --> 00:02:01.890
 I wanted that 

00:01:58.790 --> 00:02:04.020
 yes, if it just fits and you stop 

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:05.580
 I know that you live with that one 

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:06.780
 wants to go and not open but open 

00:02:05.580 --> 00:02:09.679
 holds perhaps one still has with other 

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:12.060
 children it fits halt just so 

00:02:09.679 --> 00:02:14.130
 so worried in my family too 

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:16.200
 Happy times were so glad now 

00:02:14.130 --> 00:02:18.180
 I will not singular 

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:20.610
 addressed and plural times me 

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:22.230
 do not do something 

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:25.380
 are totally excited but bavaria 

00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:26.580
 Born is beautiful as it is and 

00:02:25.380 --> 00:02:27.330
 feels nice and it has somehow 

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:30.390
 connected 

00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:33.160
 but my relationship must now too 

00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:36.130
 do not marry next year 

00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:38.750
 But there is the one criticism 

00:02:36.130 --> 00:02:41.120
 namely that where he comes to my type 

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:43.310
 Namely, it can never be said that she can prevent 

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:44.690
 But hunger always has an appetite for it 

00:02:43.310 --> 00:02:47.440
 However, if you want your first instructions 

00:02:44.690 --> 00:02:47.440
 everything is gone
