00:07:37.010 --> 00:07:37.020 
what I did is just like I count to 12

00:07:37.020 --> 00:07:38.719 
what I did is just like I count to 12
for<00:07:37.500> the<00:07:37.530> amount<00:07:37.770> of<00:07:37.830> times<00:07:38.039> that<00:07:38.130> it<00:07:38.310> changed

00:07:38.719 --> 00:07:38.729 
for the amount of times that it changed

00:07:38.729 --> 00:07:40.550 
for the amount of times that it changed
and<00:07:38.940> then<00:07:39.060> what<00:07:39.599> on<00:07:39.750> the<00:07:39.870> 12th<00:07:40.139> one<00:07:40.259> I<00:07:40.319> would

00:07:40.550 --> 00:07:40.560 
and then what on the 12th one I would

00:07:40.560 --> 00:07:41.749 
and then what on the 12th one I would
turn<00:07:40.740> to<00:07:40.889> the<00:07:40.979> two<00:07:41.130> ones<00:07:41.310> that<00:07:41.490> are<00:07:41.580> red

00:07:41.749 --> 00:07:41.759 
turn to the two ones that are red

00:07:41.759 --> 00:07:43.370 
turn to the two ones that are red
because<00:07:42.030> one<00:07:42.240> of<00:07:42.270> them<00:07:42.479> has<00:07:42.630> to<00:07:42.780> turn<00:07:42.900> blue<00:07:43.229> and

00:07:43.370 --> 00:07:43.380 
because one of them has to turn blue and

00:07:43.380 --> 00:07:44.930 
because one of them has to turn blue and
then<00:07:43.800> I<00:07:43.889> would<00:07:44.009> just<00:07:44.159> quick<00:07:44.400> run<00:07:44.580> into<00:07:44.819> that

00:07:44.930 --> 00:07:44.940 
then I would just quick run into that

00:07:44.940 --> 00:07:47.390 
then I would just quick run into that
one<00:07:45.120> and<00:07:45.389> that<00:07:45.419> was<00:07:45.840> how<00:07:45.930> I<00:07:45.960> did<00:07:46.229> it<00:07:46.349> so<00:07:46.919> yeah
