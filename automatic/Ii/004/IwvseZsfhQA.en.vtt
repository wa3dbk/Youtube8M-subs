actually come out with some legitimate

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:40.580 
actually come out with some legitimate
products<00:00:38.430> and<00:00:38.879> this<00:00:38.969> is<00:00:39.090> a<00:00:39.149> very<00:00:39.450> very<00:00:40.170> great

00:00:40.580 --> 00:00:40.590 
products and this is a very very great

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:43.610 
products and this is a very very great
step<00:00:40.950> towards<00:00:41.309> that<00:00:42.050> zoom<00:00:43.050> didn't<00:00:43.290> we<00:00:43.350> kind<00:00:43.559> of

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:43.620 
step towards that zoom didn't we kind of

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:46.850 
step towards that zoom didn't we kind of
saw<00:00:43.860> that<00:00:44.129> the<00:00:44.640> viewing<00:00:45.120> angle<00:00:45.600> on<00:00:46.320> the<00:00:46.500> pixel

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:46.860 
saw that the viewing angle on the pixel

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:49.369 
saw that the viewing angle on the pixel
Qi<00:00:47.100> hasn't<00:00:47.910> I<00:00:48.360> thought<00:00:48.600> it<00:00:48.750> was<00:00:48.840> kind<00:00:49.110> of<00:00:49.170> fat

00:00:49.369 --> 00:00:49.379 
Qi hasn't I thought it was kind of fat

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:51.470 
Qi hasn't I thought it was kind of fat
on<00:00:49.410> the<00:00:49.590> right<00:00:49.710> evidence<00:00:50.579> is<00:00:50.700> Bobo<00:00:51.090> better<00:00:51.300> on

00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:51.480 
on the right evidence is Bobo better on

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:53.779 
on the right evidence is Bobo better on
the<00:00:51.629> left<00:00:51.870> but<00:00:52.500> I<00:00:52.559> mean<00:00:52.770> at<00:00:52.980> least<00:00:53.010> we<00:00:53.579> saw

00:00:53.779 --> 00:00:53.789 
the left but I mean at least we saw

00:00:53.789 --> 00:00:55.069 
the left but I mean at least we saw
where<00:00:54.059> it<00:00:54.090> was<00:00:54.239> to<00:00:54.390> be<00:00:54.510> seen<00:00:54.780> an<00:00:54.930> improvement

00:00:55.069 --> 00:00:55.079 
where it was to be seen an improvement

00:00:55.079 --> 00:00:59.000 
where it was to be seen an improvement
since<00:00:55.710> CES<00:00:56.340> on<00:00:56.940> the<00:00:57.600> pixel<00:00:57.930> chief<00:00:58.140> screen<00:00:58.500> now

00:00:59.000 --> 00:00:59.010 
since CES on the pixel chief screen now

since CES on the pixel chief screen now
if<00:00:59.070> we<00:00:59.160> take<00:00:59.190> a<00:00:59.370> quick<00:00:59.579> look<00:00:59.910> around<00:01:00.030> this

00:01:00.319 --> 00:01:00.329 
if we take a quick look around this

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:03.319 
if we take a quick look around this
tablet<00:01:00.980> here<00:01:01.980> we<00:01:02.070> have<00:01:02.129> a<00:01:02.190> micro<00:01:02.579> SD<00:01:02.609> there's

00:01:03.319 --> 00:01:03.329

maybe<00:01:11.990> I'm<00:01:12.990> not<00:01:13.170> sure<00:01:13.409> what<00:01:13.530> that<00:01:13.560> button<00:01:13.860> is

00:01:13.969 --> 00:01:13.979 
maybe I'm not sure what that button is

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:14.710

bunch of mystery buttons up here but

00:01:21.650 --> 00:01:26.200 
bunch of mystery buttons up here but
this<00:01:21.770> is<00:01:21.950> a<00:01:21.980> 3g<00:01:22.490> unit<00:01:24.520> this<00:01:25.520> it<00:01:25.790> is<00:01:25.910> a<00:01:25.940> little

this is a 3g unit this it is a little

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:29.650 
this is a 3g unit this it is a little
bit<00:01:26.450> stick<00:01:26.870> but<00:01:27.820> still<00:01:28.820> put<00:01:29.030> a<00:01:29.060> nice<00:01:29.270> design

00:01:29.650 --> 00:01:29.660

around the other side we have the audio

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:33.880 
around the other side we have the audio
jacks<00:01:32.240> and<00:01:32.540> then<00:01:32.660> Rose<00:01:32.840> a<00:01:32.870> documentation<00:01:33.530> back

00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:33.890

units<00:01:39.050> actually<00:01:39.380> glued<00:01:39.680> to<00:01:39.860> the<00:01:39.950> plastic<00:01:40.580> so

00:01:40.780 --> 00:01:40.790 
units actually glued to the plastic so

00:01:40.790 --> 00:01:43.330 
units actually glued to the plastic so
we<00:01:40.910> can't<00:01:41.180> really<00:01:41.270> do<00:01:41.720> too<00:01:41.930> too<00:01:42.560> much<00:01:42.860> with<00:01:43.130> it

00:01:43.330 --> 00:01:43.340 
we can't really do too too much with it

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:48.850 
we can't really do too too much with it
around<00:01:44.330> the<00:01:44.510> back<00:01:47.110> looks<00:01:48.110> pretty<00:01:48.350> nice<00:01:48.530> they

00:01:48.850 --> 00:01:48.860 
around the back looks pretty nice they

00:01:48.860 --> 00:01:50.560 
around the back looks pretty nice they
have<00:01:49.010> a<00:01:49.040> little<00:01:49.369> bit<00:01:49.580> of<00:01:49.610> a<00:01:49.760> decal<00:01:50.240> design

00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:50.570 
have a little bit of a decal design

00:01:50.570 --> 00:01:52.859 
have a little bit of a decal design
almost<00:01:51.350> looks<00:01:51.500> like<00:01:51.560> you<00:01:51.710> can<00:01:51.860> sub<00:01:52.070> it<00:01:52.160> out<00:01:52.310> for

00:01:52.859 --> 00:01:52.869 
almost looks like you can sub it out for

00:01:52.869 --> 00:01:56.350 
almost looks like you can sub it out for
for<00:01:53.869> maybe<00:01:54.020> a<00:01:54.140> customized<00:01:54.830> back<00:01:55.250> plate<00:01:55.520> so

00:01:56.350 --> 00:01:56.360 
for maybe a customized back plate so

00:01:56.360 --> 00:01:58.120 
for maybe a customized back plate so
this<00:01:56.479> is<00:01:56.570> been<00:01:56.750> a<00:01:56.780> look<00:01:56.990> at<00:01:57.170> the<00:01:57.320> pixel<00:01:57.950> Qi

00:01:58.120 --> 00:01:58.130 
this is been a look at the pixel Qi
