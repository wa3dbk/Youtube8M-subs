00:00:06.570 --> 00:00:09.490 

Oh

00:00:09.490 --> 00:00:09.500 

00:00:09.500 --> 00:00:11.730 

this<00:00:09.590> is<00:00:09.680> my<00:00:09.800> new<00:00:09.980> m16<00:00:10.730> half-track

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:11.740 
this is my new m16 half-track

00:00:11.740 --> 00:00:15.419 
this is my new m16 half-track
a<00:00:11.910> wsn<00:00:12.910> model<00:00:13.530> well<00:00:14.530> this<00:00:14.799> is<00:00:14.920> the<00:00:15.039> controller

00:00:15.419 --> 00:00:15.429 
a wsn model well this is the controller

00:00:15.429 --> 00:00:19.380 
a wsn model well this is the controller
for<00:00:15.789> it<00:00:16.470> pretty<00:00:17.470> simple<00:00:17.890> a<00:00:18.150> lot<00:00:19.150> of<00:00:19.240> it<00:00:19.330> is

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:19.390 
for it pretty simple a lot of it is

00:00:19.390 --> 00:00:24.400 
for it pretty simple a lot of it is
backwards<00:00:19.990> like<00:00:20.980> this

00:00:24.400 --> 00:00:24.410 

00:00:24.410 --> 00:00:27.160 

but<00:00:25.039> forward<00:00:25.789> backwards<00:00:26.270> is<00:00:26.450> literally

00:00:27.160 --> 00:00:27.170 
but forward backwards is literally

00:00:27.170 --> 00:00:28.630 
but forward backwards is literally
forwarded<00:00:27.619> backwards<00:00:28.010> on<00:00:28.100> this<00:00:28.279> one

00:00:28.630 --> 00:00:28.640 
forwarded backwards on this one

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:32.019 
forwarded backwards on this one
this<00:00:29.420> one<00:00:29.630> is<00:00:29.750> the<00:00:29.869> steering<00:00:30.850> which<00:00:31.850> at<00:00:32.000> first

00:00:32.019 --> 00:00:32.029 
this one is the steering which at first

00:00:32.029 --> 00:00:34.330 
this one is the steering which at first
was<00:00:32.390> weird<00:00:32.660> you<00:00:32.989> would<00:00:33.559> turn<00:00:33.710> left<00:00:33.950> it<00:00:34.250> would

00:00:34.330 --> 00:00:34.340 
was weird you would turn left it would

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:35.860 
was weird you would turn left it would
go<00:00:34.460> ahead<00:00:34.580> at<00:00:34.879> the<00:00:34.940> same<00:00:35.120> time<00:00:35.390> and<00:00:35.720> if<00:00:35.809> you

00:00:35.860 --> 00:00:35.870 
go ahead at the same time and if you

00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:37.299 
go ahead at the same time and if you
turned<00:00:36.110> right<00:00:36.410> it<00:00:36.620> would<00:00:36.739> back<00:00:36.890> up<00:00:37.160> at<00:00:37.280> the

00:00:37.299 --> 00:00:37.309 
turned right it would back up at the

00:00:37.309 --> 00:00:39.670 
turned right it would back up at the
same<00:00:37.550> time<00:00:37.580> but<00:00:38.090> after<00:00:38.870> playing<00:00:39.020> with<00:00:39.290> it<00:00:39.440> it

00:00:39.670 --> 00:00:39.680 
same time but after playing with it it

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:42.970 
same time but after playing with it it
stopped<00:00:40.280> doing<00:00:40.550> that<00:00:40.750> this<00:00:41.860> adjusts<00:00:42.860> their

00:00:42.970 --> 00:00:42.980 
stopped doing that this adjusts their

00:00:42.980 --> 00:00:51.009 
stopped doing that this adjusts their
guns<00:00:48.280> but<00:00:49.280> as<00:00:49.400> you<00:00:49.519> can<00:00:49.580> see<00:00:49.690> one<00:00:50.690> of<00:00:50.809> them<00:00:50.900> the

00:00:51.009 --> 00:00:51.019 
guns but as you can see one of them the

00:00:51.019 --> 00:00:53.500 
guns but as you can see one of them the
game<00:00:51.170> broke<00:00:51.440> off<00:00:51.850> and<00:00:52.850> I'll<00:00:53.059> demonstrate<00:00:53.210> the

00:00:53.500 --> 00:00:53.510 
game broke off and I'll demonstrate the

00:00:53.510 --> 00:01:02.380 
game broke off and I'll demonstrate the
fire<00:01:00.129> so<00:01:01.129> unfortunately<00:01:01.760> it<00:01:01.910> means<00:01:02.000> that<00:01:02.239> also

00:01:02.380 --> 00:01:02.390 
fire so unfortunately it means that also

00:01:02.390 --> 00:01:05.310 
fire so unfortunately it means that also
that<00:01:02.600> one<00:01:03.079> of<00:01:03.170> the<00:01:03.230> LEDs<00:01:03.649> is<00:01:03.920> broke<00:01:04.190> off<00:01:04.430> and

00:01:05.310 --> 00:01:05.320 
that one of the LEDs is broke off and

00:01:05.320 --> 00:01:08.800 
that one of the LEDs is broke off and
judging<00:01:06.320> by<00:01:06.350> right<00:01:07.130> there<00:01:07.509> there<00:01:08.509> supposed<00:01:08.750> to

00:01:08.800 --> 00:01:08.810 
judging by right there there supposed to

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:11.650 
judging by right there there supposed to
be<00:01:08.869> a<00:01:08.960> board<00:01:09.740> of<00:01:09.890> some<00:01:10.039> sort<00:01:10.340> but<00:01:11.300> these<00:01:11.509> things

00:01:11.650 --> 00:01:11.660 
be a board of some sort but these things

00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:13.090 
be a board of some sort but these things
are<00:01:11.840> mounted<00:01:12.200> on<00:01:12.259> that<00:01:12.410> sticks<00:01:12.649> into<00:01:12.830> there

00:01:13.090 --> 00:01:13.100 
are mounted on that sticks into there

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:15.340 
are mounted on that sticks into there
and<00:01:13.369> so<00:01:14.360> they're<00:01:14.509> not<00:01:14.570> removable<00:01:14.990> as<00:01:15.170> most

00:01:15.340 --> 00:01:15.350 
and so they're not removable as most

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:18.910 
and so they're not removable as most
people<00:01:15.649> said<00:01:15.890> oh<00:01:17.020> yeah<00:01:18.020> you<00:01:18.619> have<00:01:18.710> a<00:01:18.770> nice

00:01:18.910 --> 00:01:18.920 
people said oh yeah you have a nice

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:21.010 
people said oh yeah you have a nice
on/off<00:01:19.369> switch<00:01:19.640> inside<00:01:20.030> which<00:01:20.300> is<00:01:20.450> easy<00:01:20.720> to

00:01:21.010 --> 00:01:21.020 
on/off switch inside which is easy to

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:23.980 
on/off switch inside which is easy to
get<00:01:21.410> to<00:01:21.710> with<00:01:22.700> a<00:01:22.729> lot<00:01:23.090> of<00:01:23.119> the<00:01:23.330> tanks<00:01:23.690> some<00:01:23.840> of

00:01:23.980 --> 00:01:23.990 
get to with a lot of the tanks some of

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:26.100 
get to with a lot of the tanks some of
them<00:01:24.110> are<00:01:24.259> underneath<00:01:24.619> there<00:01:24.890> like<00:01:25.130> that

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:26.110 
them are underneath there like that

00:01:26.110 --> 00:01:29.350 
them are underneath there like that
controllers<00:01:27.110> pretty<00:01:27.259> basic<00:01:27.470> the<00:01:28.399> trim<00:01:29.060> levels

00:01:29.350 --> 00:01:29.360 
controllers pretty basic the trim levels

00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:34.150 
controllers pretty basic the trim levels
do<00:01:29.630> actually<00:01:30.229> work<00:01:30.440> those<00:01:31.220> trims<00:01:32.830> house<00:01:33.830> for

00:01:34.150 --> 00:01:34.160 
do actually work those trims house for

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:37.120 
do actually work those trims house for
the<00:01:34.310> half-track<00:01:34.849> itself<00:01:35.259> that<00:01:36.259> is<00:01:36.500> a<00:01:36.770> rubber

00:01:37.120 --> 00:01:37.130 
the half-track itself that is a rubber

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:39.279 
the half-track itself that is a rubber
tire<00:01:37.369> it's<00:01:37.819> hard<00:01:38.000> to<00:01:38.119> tell<00:01:38.300> but<00:01:38.599> slightly

00:01:39.279 --> 00:01:39.289 
tire it's hard to tell but slightly

00:01:39.289 --> 00:01:42.419 
tire it's hard to tell but slightly
rubberized<00:01:39.770> these<00:01:40.610> treads<00:01:40.970> are<00:01:41.270> a<00:01:41.300> nice<00:01:41.690> soft

00:01:42.419 --> 00:01:42.429 
rubberized these treads are a nice soft

00:01:42.429 --> 00:01:45.669 
rubberized these treads are a nice soft
gripping<00:01:43.429> rubber<00:01:43.910> I'm<00:01:44.899> quite<00:01:45.170> surprised<00:01:45.530> I

00:01:45.669 --> 00:01:45.679 
gripping rubber I'm quite surprised I

00:01:45.679 --> 00:01:47.820 
gripping rubber I'm quite surprised I
thought<00:01:45.860> they<00:01:45.979> would<00:01:46.130> cheap<00:01:46.310> out<00:01:46.490> on<00:01:46.520> that<00:01:46.880> but

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:47.830 
thought they would cheap out on that but

00:01:47.830 --> 00:01:49.419 
thought they would cheap out on that but
no<00:01:48.830> it<00:01:48.890> seems<00:01:49.099> to<00:01:49.220> work

00:01:49.419 --> 00:01:49.429 
no it seems to work

00:01:49.429 --> 00:01:51.430 
no it seems to work
it's<00:01:49.819> not<00:01:49.970> hard<00:01:50.209> plastic<00:01:50.810> so<00:01:50.990> it<00:01:51.170> won't<00:01:51.349> have

00:01:51.430 --> 00:01:51.440 
it's not hard plastic so it won't have

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:56.130 
it's not hard plastic so it won't have
traction<00:01:51.770> problems<00:01:53.200> the<00:01:54.200> antenna

00:01:56.130 --> 00:01:56.140 
traction problems the antenna

00:01:56.140 --> 00:01:58.920 
traction problems the antenna
is<00:01:56.680> actually<00:01:57.130> scale<00:01:57.400> see<00:01:58.270> the<00:01:58.390> antenna<00:01:58.630> sorry

00:01:58.920 --> 00:01:58.930 
is actually scale see the antenna sorry

back<00:02:42.370> here<00:02:43.260> there's<00:02:44.260> giant<00:02:45.040> fuel<00:02:45.519> tanks<00:02:45.910> on

00:02:46.020 --> 00:02:46.030 
back here there's giant fuel tanks on

00:02:46.030 --> 00:02:49.890 
back here there's giant fuel tanks on
both<00:02:46.180> sides<00:02:46.650> pretty<00:02:47.650> nice<00:02:47.980> and<00:02:48.489> you<00:02:49.480> start<00:02:49.810> to

00:02:49.890 --> 00:02:49.900 
both sides pretty nice and you start to

00:02:49.900 --> 00:02:53.759 
both sides pretty nice and you start to
see<00:02:50.310> actually<00:02:51.310> is<00:02:51.459> using<00:02:51.700> real<00:02:52.180> servos<00:02:52.810> not

00:02:53.759 --> 00:02:53.769 
see actually is using real servos not

00:02:53.769 --> 00:02:56.220 
see actually is using real servos not
those<00:02:54.670> cheap<00:02:55.000> Chinese<00:02:55.390> servos<00:02:55.810> that<00:02:56.019> are

00:02:56.220 --> 00:02:56.230 
those cheap Chinese servos that are

00:02:56.230 --> 00:02:58.560 
those cheap Chinese servos that are
basically<00:02:57.160> electro<00:02:57.760> magnetics<00:02:58.300> that<00:02:58.480> are

00:02:58.560 --> 00:02:58.570 
basically electro magnetics that are

00:02:58.570 --> 00:03:00.600 
basically electro magnetics that are
full<00:02:58.780> left<00:02:59.050> full<00:02:59.380> right<00:02:59.650> that's<00:03:00.100> it

00:03:00.600 --> 00:03:00.610 
full left full right that's it

00:03:00.610 --> 00:03:04.410 
full left full right that's it
oh<00:03:00.959> this<00:03:01.959> one's<00:03:02.200> actually<00:03:02.590> pretty<00:03:02.860> good<00:03:03.420> I'll

00:03:04.410 --> 00:03:04.420 
oh this one's actually pretty good I'll

00:03:04.420 --> 00:03:14.690 
oh this one's actually pretty good I'll
stick<00:03:04.660> again<00:03:06.450> gonna<00:03:07.450> get<00:03:07.630> used<00:03:07.840> to<00:03:07.930> that

00:03:14.690 --> 00:03:14.700 

00:03:14.700 --> 00:03:17.450 

and<00:03:15.700> this<00:03:15.880> go<00:03:16.180> pretty<00:03:16.480> much<00:03:16.510> straight<00:03:16.960> up<00:03:17.140> to

00:03:17.450 --> 00:03:17.460 
and this go pretty much straight up to

00:03:17.460 --> 00:03:20.580 
and this go pretty much straight up to
that's<00:03:18.460> full<00:03:18.760> up<00:03:18.970> it<00:03:19.690> just<00:03:19.810> doesn't<00:03:20.200> go

00:03:20.580 --> 00:03:20.590 
that's full up it just doesn't go

00:03:20.590 --> 00:03:26.040 
that's full up it just doesn't go
anymore<00:03:20.770> after<00:03:20.980> that<00:03:24.330> and<00:03:25.330> pull<00:03:25.810> down

00:03:26.040 --> 00:03:26.050 
anymore after that and pull down

00:03:26.050 --> 00:03:28.200 
anymore after that and pull down
wouldn't<00:03:27.010> she<00:03:27.040> oppose<00:03:27.430> the<00:03:27.610> driver<00:03:27.910> I'd

00:03:28.200 --> 00:03:28.210 
wouldn't she oppose the driver I'd

00:03:28.210 --> 00:03:29.850 
wouldn't she oppose the driver I'd
always<00:03:28.480> keep<00:03:28.630> my<00:03:28.750> head<00:03:28.900> below<00:03:29.200> that<00:03:29.380> level<00:03:29.710> so

00:03:29.850 --> 00:03:29.860 
always keep my head below that level so

00:03:29.860 --> 00:03:33.330 
always keep my head below that level so
I<00:03:29.920> think<00:03:29.980> in<00:03:30.190> my<00:03:30.280> head<00:03:30.460> took<00:03:30.730> off<00:03:32.340> backsides

00:03:33.330 --> 00:03:33.340 
I think in my head took off backsides

00:03:33.340 --> 00:03:35.460 
I think in my head took off backsides
pretty<00:03:33.580> good<00:03:33.820> it<00:03:34.540> does<00:03:34.780> actually<00:03:35.110> have<00:03:35.440> a

00:03:35.460 --> 00:03:35.470 
pretty good it does actually have a

00:03:35.470 --> 00:03:37.050 
pretty good it does actually have a
hitch

00:03:37.050 --> 00:03:37.060 
hitch

00:03:37.060 --> 00:03:38.760 
hitch
I<00:03:37.090> don't<00:03:37.570> know<00:03:37.660> how<00:03:37.780> functional<00:03:38.410> it<00:03:38.560> is

00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:38.770 
I don't know how functional it is

00:03:38.770 --> 00:03:40.830 
I don't know how functional it is
probably<00:03:39.640> easily<00:03:40.060> replaced<00:03:40.360> with<00:03:40.570> something

00:03:40.830 --> 00:03:40.840 
probably easily replaced with something

00:03:40.840 --> 00:03:44.699 
probably easily replaced with something
off<00:03:40.930> a<00:03:40.959> garden<00:03:41.910> mud<00:03:42.910> flaps<00:03:43.209> are<00:03:43.510> solid<00:03:44.140> plastic

off a garden mud flaps are solid plastic

00:03:44.709 --> 00:03:48.390 
off a garden mud flaps are solid plastic
which<00:03:45.040> kind<00:03:45.490> of<00:03:45.580> limits<00:03:45.940> its<00:03:46.530> mobility<00:03:47.530> it's

00:03:48.390 --> 00:03:48.400 
which kind of limits its mobility it's

00:03:48.400 --> 00:03:52.760 
which kind of limits its mobility it's

00:03:52.760 --> 00:03:52.770 
that it's dead they will be upgraded

00:03:52.770 --> 00:03:57.180 
that it's dead they will be upgraded

move<00:03:57.430> though<00:03:57.730> I<00:03:58.000> saw<00:03:58.239> an<00:03:58.360> auction<00:03:58.750> on<00:03:58.810> eBay

00:03:58.979 --> 00:03:58.989 
move though I saw an auction on eBay

00:03:58.989 --> 00:04:01.260 
move though I saw an auction on eBay
where<00:03:59.530> the<00:03:59.650> guy<00:03:59.770> had<00:03:59.950> took<00:04:00.160> these<00:04:00.400> sides<00:04:00.700> and

00:04:01.260 --> 00:04:01.270 
where the guy had took these sides and

00:04:01.270 --> 00:04:03.300 
where the guy had took these sides and
made<00:04:01.870> him<00:04:01.989> so<00:04:02.110> they<00:04:02.230> were<00:04:02.440> folded<00:04:02.709> down<00:04:03.040> in

00:04:03.300 --> 00:04:03.310 
made him so they were folded down in

00:04:03.310 --> 00:04:07.199 
made him so they were folded down in
battle<00:04:03.910> position<00:04:04.739> very<00:04:05.739> nice<00:04:05.980> I<00:04:06.340> would<00:04:07.000> have

00:04:07.199 --> 00:04:07.209 
battle position very nice I would have

00:04:07.209 --> 00:04:08.820 
battle position very nice I would have
probably<00:04:07.360> been<00:04:07.690> on<00:04:07.840> it<00:04:07.959> it<00:04:08.140> was<00:04:08.260> reasonably

00:04:08.820 --> 00:04:08.830 
probably been on it it was reasonably

00:04:08.830 --> 00:04:12.979 
probably been on it it was reasonably
the<00:04:08.920> same<00:04:09.100> price<00:04:09.370> was<00:04:10.000> in<00:04:10.680> Europe<00:04:11.680> though<00:04:11.920> so

00:04:12.979 --> 00:04:12.989 
the same price was in Europe though so

00:04:12.989 --> 00:04:14.789 
the same price was in Europe though so
that<00:04:13.989> would<00:04:14.080> have<00:04:14.170> been<00:04:14.260> fun<00:04:14.440> getting<00:04:14.590> that

00:04:14.789 --> 00:04:14.799 
that would have been fun getting that

00:04:14.799 --> 00:04:17.520 
that would have been fun getting that
over<00:04:15.070> here<00:04:15.190> in<00:04:15.280> time<00:04:15.430> for<00:04:15.610> Christmas<00:04:16.410> there<00:04:17.410> is

00:04:18.930 --> 00:04:18.940 
a winch on the front it does not

00:04:18.940 --> 00:04:21.360 
a winch on the front it does not
function<00:04:19.359> but<00:04:19.810> it<00:04:19.930> does<00:04:20.140> actually<00:04:20.500> turn<00:04:21.040> I

00:04:21.360 --> 00:04:21.370 
function but it does actually turn I

00:04:21.370 --> 00:04:23.730

with another fuel tank shovel pickaxe

00:04:41.690 --> 00:04:44.400 
with another fuel tank shovel pickaxe
and<00:04:41.840> this<00:04:42.380> sides<00:04:42.560> pretty<00:04:42.800> recently<00:04:43.340> clean<00:04:43.610> too

00:04:44.400 --> 00:04:44.410

let's<00:04:45.410> see<00:04:45.560> the<00:04:45.680> fake<00:04:45.890> suspension<00:04:46.550> back<00:04:46.730> there

00:04:47.260 --> 00:04:47.270 
let's see the fake suspension back there

00:04:47.270 --> 00:04:50.110 
let's see the fake suspension back there
the<00:04:47.810> rollers<00:04:48.200> are<00:04:48.230> nice<00:04:48.500> on<00:04:48.710> this<00:04:48.890> too<00:04:49.120> they

00:04:50.110 --> 00:04:50.120 
the rollers are nice on this too they

00:04:50.120 --> 00:04:52.450 
the rollers are nice on this too they
lift<00:04:50.390> up<00:04:50.570> like<00:04:50.720> this<00:04:50.990> set<00:04:51.980> the<00:04:52.100> camera<00:04:52.430> down

00:04:52.450 --> 00:04:52.460 
lift up like this set the camera down

00:04:52.460 --> 00:04:55.330 
lift up like this set the camera down
here<00:04:53.380> but<00:04:54.380> when<00:04:54.500> you<00:04:54.560> have<00:04:54.680> this<00:04:54.830> lifted<00:04:55.220> up

00:04:55.330 --> 00:04:55.340 
here but when you have this lifted up

00:04:55.340 --> 00:04:57.430 
here but when you have this lifted up
you<00:04:55.730> can<00:04:55.880> actually<00:04:56.060> flip<00:04:56.690> the<00:04:56.900> rollers<00:04:57.200> all

00:04:57.430 --> 00:04:57.440 
you can actually flip the rollers all

00:04:57.440 --> 00:05:03.030 
you can actually flip the rollers all
the<00:04:57.530> way<00:04:57.620> around<00:04:57.890> they<00:04:58.520> just<00:04:58.700> keep<00:04:58.970> going

00:05:03.030 --> 00:05:03.040 

00:05:03.040 --> 00:05:06.670 

so<00:05:04.040> actually<00:05:04.760> has<00:05:04.910> full<00:05:05.270> rollers<00:05:05.750> and<00:05:05.990> even

00:05:06.670 --> 00:05:06.680 
so actually has full rollers and even

00:05:06.680 --> 00:05:08.950 
so actually has full rollers and even
the<00:05:06.860> little<00:05:07.460> wheels<00:05:07.670> here<00:05:08.000> are<00:05:08.210> slightly<00:05:08.630> art

00:05:08.950 --> 00:05:08.960 
the little wheels here are slightly art

00:05:08.960 --> 00:05:12.010 
the little wheels here are slightly art
yeah<00:05:09.200> there<00:05:09.440> are<00:05:09.620> arised<00:05:10.720> only<00:05:11.720> the<00:05:11.840> top

00:05:12.010 --> 00:05:12.020 
yeah there are arised only the top

00:05:12.020 --> 00:05:13.840 
yeah there are arised only the top
roller<00:05:12.530> wheels<00:05:12.770> don't<00:05:12.950> like<00:05:13.130> full<00:05:13.310> plastic

00:05:13.840 --> 00:05:13.850 
roller wheels don't like full plastic

00:05:13.850 --> 00:05:15.850 
roller wheels don't like full plastic
one<00:05:14.000> other<00:05:14.210> than<00:05:14.420> these<00:05:14.630> two<00:05:14.690> and<00:05:15.260> wheels

00:05:15.850 --> 00:05:15.860 
one other than these two and wheels

00:05:15.860 --> 00:05:19.900 
one other than these two and wheels
which<00:05:16.820> have<00:05:17.240> a<00:05:17.740> pretty<00:05:18.740> much<00:05:18.980> good<00:05:19.250> grooves<00:05:19.700> in

00:05:19.900 --> 00:05:19.910 
which have a pretty much good grooves in

00:05:19.910 --> 00:05:23.440 
which have a pretty much good grooves in
there<00:05:20.030> to<00:05:20.210> hold<00:05:20.360> on<00:05:20.570> to<00:05:20.690> the<00:05:20.780> track<00:05:21.110> just<00:05:22.450> kind

00:05:23.440 --> 00:05:23.450 
there to hold on to the track just kind

00:05:23.450 --> 00:05:26.260 
there to hold on to the track just kind
of<00:05:23.480> like<00:05:23.600> snowmobile<00:05:24.050> tracks<00:05:24.910> now<00:05:25.910> for<00:05:26.210> the

00:05:26.260 --> 00:05:26.270 
of like snowmobile tracks now for the

00:05:26.270 --> 00:05:34.570 
of like snowmobile tracks now for the
underside<00:05:30.760> well<00:05:31.810> first<00:05:32.810> glance<00:05:33.050> actual<00:05:34.040> servo

00:05:34.570 --> 00:05:34.580 
underside well first glance actual servo

00:05:34.580 --> 00:05:39.160 
underside well first glance actual servo
again<00:05:35.090> very<00:05:36.080> glad<00:05:36.410> for<00:05:36.710> that<00:05:37.300> it's<00:05:38.300> a<00:05:38.630> fake

00:05:39.160 --> 00:05:39.170 
again very glad for that it's a fake

00:05:39.170 --> 00:05:41.530 
again very glad for that it's a fake
four-wheel<00:05:39.980> drive<00:05:40.310> or<00:05:40.820> from<00:05:41.000> an<00:05:41.150> old<00:05:41.270> Drive<00:05:41.510> I

00:05:41.530 --> 00:05:41.540 
four-wheel drive or from an old Drive I

00:05:41.540 --> 00:05:45.540 
four-wheel drive or from an old Drive I
guess<00:05:41.810> I<00:05:41.930> should<00:05:42.110> say<00:05:42.340> but<00:05:43.570> I'm<00:05:44.570> happy<00:05:45.080> it

00:05:45.540 --> 00:05:45.550 
guess I should say but I'm happy it

00:05:45.550 --> 00:05:49.390 
guess I should say but I'm happy it
actually<00:05:46.550> steers<00:05:47.500> steering<00:05:48.500> bar<00:05:48.680> which<00:05:49.130> has

00:05:49.390 --> 00:05:49.400 
actually steers steering bar which has

00:05:49.400 --> 00:05:51.670 
actually steers steering bar which has
some<00:05:49.640> play<00:05:49.790> so<00:05:50.000> you<00:05:50.350> bend<00:05:51.350> it<00:05:51.470> in<00:05:51.560> you're

00:05:51.670 --> 00:05:51.680 
some play so you bend it in you're

00:05:51.680 --> 00:05:54.940 
some play so you bend it in you're
screwed<00:05:52.010> you<00:05:53.000> can<00:05:53.150> see<00:05:53.360> in<00:05:53.480> there<00:05:53.770> 360<00:05:54.770> type

00:05:54.940 --> 00:05:54.950 
screwed you can see in there 360 type

00:05:54.950 --> 00:05:58.360 
screwed you can see in there 360 type
motor<00:05:55.750> so<00:05:56.750> actually<00:05:57.410> it<00:05:57.530> drives<00:05:57.800> down<00:05:57.890> into

00:05:58.360 --> 00:05:58.370 
motor so actually it drives down into

00:05:58.370 --> 00:06:00.670 
motor so actually it drives down into
here<00:05:58.550> to<00:05:58.700> this<00:05:58.820> gearbox<00:05:59.090> full<00:06:00.080> drive<00:06:00.380> shaft

00:06:00.670 --> 00:06:00.680 
here to this gearbox full drive shaft

00:06:00.680 --> 00:06:03.190 
here to this gearbox full drive shaft
which<00:06:01.040> goes<00:06:01.280> into<00:06:01.669> this<00:06:01.970> axle<00:06:02.690> that<00:06:02.810> powers

00:06:03.190 --> 00:06:03.200 
which goes into this axle that powers

00:06:03.200 --> 00:06:07.320 
which goes into this axle that powers
the<00:06:03.440> front<00:06:03.940> which<00:06:04.940> I<00:06:05.300> hit<00:06:05.690> the<00:06:05.840> right<00:06:05.990> stick

00:06:07.320 --> 00:06:07.330 
the front which I hit the right stick

00:06:07.330 --> 00:06:16.160 
the front which I hit the right stick
Roxtec<00:06:08.330> again<00:06:09.220> to<00:06:10.220> see<00:06:10.400> it<00:06:10.490> work

00:06:16.160 --> 00:06:16.170 

00:06:16.170 --> 00:06:19.250 

very<00:06:17.170> happy<00:06:17.620> once<00:06:17.770> again<00:06:17.860> you<00:06:18.790> can<00:06:18.910> see<00:06:19.060> the

00:06:19.250 --> 00:06:19.260 
very happy once again you can see the

00:06:19.260 --> 00:06:21.600 
very happy once again you can see the
leads<00:06:20.260> for<00:06:20.500> servos<00:06:20.920> and<00:06:20.950> stuff<00:06:21.250> run<00:06:21.430> down

00:06:21.600 --> 00:06:21.610 
leads for servos and stuff run down

00:06:21.610 --> 00:06:24.390 
leads for servos and stuff run down
there<00:06:21.910> the<00:06:22.660> exhaust<00:06:22.990> which<00:06:23.410> I<00:06:23.830> don't<00:06:24.220> really

00:06:24.390 --> 00:06:24.400 
there the exhaust which I don't really

00:06:24.400 --> 00:06:27.900 
there the exhaust which I don't really
bother<00:06:24.760> with<00:06:25.090> and<00:06:26.020> this<00:06:26.860> is<00:06:26.920> the<00:06:27.220> battery<00:06:27.460> box

00:06:27.900 --> 00:06:27.910 
bother with and this is the battery box

00:06:27.910 --> 00:06:30.750 
bother with and this is the battery box
it<00:06:28.360> takes<00:06:28.840> 8<00:06:29.140> double-a<00:06:29.770> batteries<00:06:30.250> in<00:06:30.580> the

00:06:30.750 --> 00:06:30.760 
it takes 8 double-a batteries in the

00:06:30.760 --> 00:06:34.500 
it takes 8 double-a batteries in the
battery<00:06:31.240> box<00:06:31.600> which<00:06:31.960> isn't<00:06:32.890> too<00:06:33.130> bad<00:06:33.510> that's

00:06:34.500 --> 00:06:34.510 
battery box which isn't too bad that's

00:06:34.510 --> 00:06:41.070 
battery box which isn't too bad that's
the<00:06:34.690> speaker<00:06:35.050> for<00:06:35.470> that<00:06:39.390> so<00:06:40.390> all-in-all<00:06:40.720> is

00:06:41.070 --> 00:06:41.080 
the speaker for that so all-in-all is

00:06:41.080 --> 00:06:44.460 
the speaker for that so all-in-all is
pretty<00:06:41.290> good<00:06:42.060> uh<00:06:43.060> just<00:06:43.630> trying<00:06:43.990> to<00:06:44.140> see<00:06:44.380> if

00:06:44.460 --> 00:06:44.470 
pretty good uh just trying to see if

00:06:44.470 --> 00:06:45.870 
pretty good uh just trying to see if
there's<00:06:44.650> any<00:06:44.830> more<00:06:45.040> things<00:06:45.250> to<00:06:45.490> point<00:06:45.640> out

00:06:45.870 --> 00:06:45.880 
there's any more things to point out

00:06:45.880 --> 00:06:49.620 
there's any more things to point out
underneath<00:06:46.240> here<00:06:46.660> I<00:06:48.240> guess<00:06:49.240> that's<00:06:49.450> about<00:06:49.510> it

00:06:49.620 --> 00:06:49.630 
underneath here I guess that's about it

00:06:49.630 --> 00:06:51.480 
underneath here I guess that's about it
you<00:06:49.840> can<00:06:49.960> see<00:06:50.110> the<00:06:50.260> wires<00:06:50.500> for<00:06:50.800> the<00:06:50.920> lights<00:06:51.280> and

00:06:51.480 --> 00:06:51.490 
you can see the wires for the lights and

00:06:51.490 --> 00:06:53.700 
you can see the wires for the lights and
stuff<00:06:51.640> like<00:06:51.850> that<00:06:52.140> there's<00:06:53.140> still<00:06:53.320> other<00:06:53.500> way

00:06:53.700 --> 00:06:53.710 
stuff like that there's still other way

00:06:53.710 --> 00:06:58.620 
stuff like that there's still other way
so<00:06:54.420> trades<00:06:55.420> won't<00:06:55.660> grab<00:06:55.840> them<00:06:57.240> but<00:06:58.240> other<00:06:58.420> than

00:06:58.620 --> 00:06:58.630 
so trades won't grab them but other than

00:06:58.630 --> 00:07:01.650 
so trades won't grab them but other than
that<00:06:58.840> it<00:06:58.960> should<00:06:58.990> be<00:06:59.230> ok<00:07:00.180> good<00:07:01.180> upgrade<00:07:01.360> this

00:07:01.650 --> 00:07:01.660 
that it should be ok good upgrade this

00:07:01.660 --> 00:07:03.690 
that it should be ok good upgrade this
to<00:07:01.720> a<00:07:01.840> real<00:07:02.080> suspension<00:07:02.740> and<00:07:02.920> put<00:07:03.400> a<00:07:03.430> live

00:07:03.690 --> 00:07:03.700 
to a real suspension and put a live

00:07:03.700 --> 00:07:05.220 
to a real suspension and put a live
front<00:07:04.150> in<00:07:04.300> there<00:07:04.420> if<00:07:04.540> you<00:07:04.630> really<00:07:04.810> want<00:07:05.020> it<00:07:05.110> to

00:07:05.220 --> 00:07:05.230 
front in there if you really want it to

00:07:05.230 --> 00:07:06.450 
front in there if you really want it to
but<00:07:05.410> then<00:07:05.530> you'd<00:07:05.620> have<00:07:05.740> to<00:07:05.830> build<00:07:05.950> a<00:07:06.070> steering

00:07:06.450 --> 00:07:06.460 
but then you'd have to build a steering

00:07:06.460 --> 00:07:13.980 
but then you'd have to build a steering
servo<00:07:07.470> and<00:07:08.470> why<00:07:09.250> make<00:07:09.460> it<00:07:09.490> harder<00:07:12.600> so<00:07:13.600> there

00:07:13.980 --> 00:07:13.990 
servo and why make it harder so there

00:07:13.990 --> 00:07:18.480 
servo and why make it harder so there
you<00:07:14.110> go<00:07:14.580> that's<00:07:15.580> my<00:07:15.790> m16
