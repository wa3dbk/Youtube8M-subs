I<00:00:15.780> quickly<00:00:16.049> just<00:00:16.350> want<00:00:16.560> to<00:00:16.680> tell<00:00:16.830> you<00:00:16.920> guys<00:00:17.070> a

00:00:17.090 --> 00:00:17.100 
I quickly just want to tell you guys a

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:19.370 
I quickly just want to tell you guys a
little<00:00:17.279> bit<00:00:17.550> about<00:00:17.730> my<00:00:17.880> skin<00:00:18.240> so<00:00:18.660> my<00:00:19.140> skin

00:00:19.370 --> 00:00:19.380 
little bit about my skin so my skin

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:21.470 
little bit about my skin so my skin
isn't<00:00:19.619> oily<00:00:20.070> but<00:00:20.310> it<00:00:20.369> isn't<00:00:20.640> dry<00:00:20.910> like

00:00:21.470 --> 00:00:21.480 
isn't oily but it isn't dry like

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:23.090 
isn't oily but it isn't dry like
sometimes<00:00:21.869> it<00:00:21.990> has<00:00:22.140> dry<00:00:22.410> spots<00:00:22.710> and<00:00:22.980> then

00:00:23.090 --> 00:00:23.100 
sometimes it has dry spots and then

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:25.070 
sometimes it has dry spots and then
sometimes<00:00:23.490> it<00:00:23.640> gets<00:00:23.789> oily<00:00:24.269> right<00:00:24.449> here<00:00:24.630> so<00:00:24.869> I

00:00:25.070 --> 00:00:25.080 
sometimes it gets oily right here so I

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:27.019 
sometimes it gets oily right here so I
guess<00:00:25.529> I'm<00:00:25.680> kind<00:00:25.890> of<00:00:25.980> normal<00:00:26.550> but<00:00:26.849> like

00:00:27.019 --> 00:00:27.029 
guess I'm kind of normal but like

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:29.599 
guess I'm kind of normal but like
combination<00:00:27.750> at<00:00:27.840> the<00:00:27.930> same<00:00:28.140> time<00:00:28.429> so<00:00:29.429> I'm<00:00:29.490> not

00:00:29.599 --> 00:00:29.609 
combination at the same time so I'm not

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:31.910 
combination at the same time so I'm not
really<00:00:29.820> this<00:00:30.480> or<00:00:30.689> that<00:00:30.840> but<00:00:31.170> I<00:00:31.380> don't<00:00:31.529> know<00:00:31.679> and
