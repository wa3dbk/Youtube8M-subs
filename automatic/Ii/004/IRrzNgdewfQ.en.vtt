the<00:04:41.890> brake<00:04:42.550> rod<00:04:42.850> is<00:04:43.840> in<00:04:44.020> place<00:04:44.260> but<00:04:44.740> i<00:04:45.040> don't

00:04:45.330 --> 00:04:45.340 
the brake rod is in place but i don't

00:04:45.340 --> 00:04:47.220 
the brake rod is in place but i don't
know<00:04:45.520> i<00:04:45.550> don't<00:04:45.730> like<00:04:45.970> how<00:04:46.120> how<00:04:46.510> I<00:04:46.540> did<00:04:46.870> it<00:04:47.020> so<00:04:47.200> I
