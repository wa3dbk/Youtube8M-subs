 apply a little of what you have 

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:02.699

 both Mexican or American a bit of what 

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:08.010
 what I learned does not exceed 

00:01:05.730 --> 00:01:10.380
 today you are in this new adventure of 

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:12.120
 stained glass he is the executive chef there 

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:13.620
 I imagine the menu of what was before 

00:01:12.120 --> 00:01:15.480
 now it must be something else totally 

00:01:13.620 --> 00:01:18.870
 different what I try to do is a 

00:01:15.480 --> 00:01:20.970
 modern mexican cuisine with many this 

00:01:18.870 --> 00:01:23.340
 with many techniques and ingredients 

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:25.320
 other cultures to make them stand out 

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:26.730
 the following Mexican is not for 

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:28.530
 example right now then bring a salad 

00:01:26.730 --> 00:01:30.800
 of panela with a chipotle vinaigrette 

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:33.750
 and strawberry now later to see if we're going 

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:35.250
 although starting to prepare people 

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:36.480
 like the toja can do this almost 

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:38.880
 it is being possible to commercial entry 

00:01:36.480 --> 00:01:41.100
 and it 's very simple the truth is something 

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:44.840
 very fresh and very healthy this sometimes 

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:44.840
 you want to help me with everything 

00:01:45.110 --> 00:01:53.600
 prepared so that people who are a 

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:53.600
 little mustard dijon a spoonful 

00:01:56.960 --> 00:02:01.290
 a spoonful without fears and a half always 

00:01:59.760 --> 00:02:03.480
 improve with confidence and without fear well 

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:05.520
 is grabbing two tablespoons of jam 

00:02:03.480 --> 00:02:06.540
 strawberry strawberry jam to them 

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:08.310
 let's put the ingredients in the 

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:10.640
 screen two tablespoons the tablespoons or 

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:10.640
 a 

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:19.050
 and a spoon of the type of a law 

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:21.870
 It depends how much the spicy does not 

00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:24.750
 clear each one teaspoon of chipotle 

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:26.640
 there is about 2 ounces of vinegar 

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:28.410
 balsamic so he believes you so that you 

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:31.080
 Add the acidity this is what you tell me 

00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:33.510
 and at least vinegar and appointments 

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:35.010
 balsamic today that riga I'm 

00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:37.110
 imagining the fusion of flavors of this 

00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:39.810
 very tasty true of the freshness of the 

00:02:37.110 --> 00:02:42.090
 recipe not and right now with the newbie debate 

00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:44.760
 you just debate more as well as with 

00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:48.269
 the herd like chocolate granny in the 

00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:50.940
 box there is also latex and little bit 

00:02:48.269 --> 00:02:53.130
 you will be adding the oil to the oil 

00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:57.680
 since he knows thrilling beauty is 

00:02:53.130 --> 00:02:57.680
 part of the secret only yes no 

00:03:01.090 --> 00:03:05.570
 and the oil is guided and goes 

00:03:03.320 --> 00:03:08.870
 stirring as I feel in mocking like this 

00:03:05.570 --> 00:03:11.120
 it's like this is it 's basically always use 

00:03:08.870 --> 00:03:13.430
 with the amount of vinegar with oil 

00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:16.880
 use three times oil with a quantity 

00:03:13.430 --> 00:03:23.390
 of vinegar although this bed bursts 

00:03:16.880 --> 00:03:25.910
 we have little salt and I in my house a 

00:03:23.390 --> 00:03:28.660
 little bit of powder to get a grip 

00:03:25.910 --> 00:03:31.610
 little bit more flavor ok ok garlic powder salt 

00:03:28.660 --> 00:03:33.830
 mustard cheetah strawberry jam a 

00:03:31.610 --> 00:03:35.720
 proof already and with which they squared with the 

00:03:33.830 --> 00:03:37.130
 finger with the spoon like having a 

00:03:35.720 --> 00:03:39.200
 shadow with the spoon because it is in the 

00:03:37.130 --> 00:03:43.510
 tele that teaches good manners to the 

00:03:39.200 --> 00:03:43.510
 time as well as buses 

00:03:44.560 --> 00:03:49.360
 sweet i liked that well balanced 

00:03:49.990 --> 00:03:54.410
 Now he puts us a vinaigrette that already 

00:03:53.030 --> 00:03:56.180
 was our vinegar had remained 

00:03:54.410 --> 00:03:58.970
 then what are we going to do 

00:03:56.180 --> 00:04:00.860
 zorita incorporate the rest grace in the 

00:03:58.970 --> 00:04:02.330
 same not in the same bowl so no more 

00:04:00.860 --> 00:04:04.220
 15 little so it does not get wet 

00:04:02.330 --> 00:04:06.530
 too much lettuce ok we add the 

00:04:04.220 --> 00:04:08.150

00:04:06.530 --> 00:04:08.750
 Mixa lettuce is found in any 

00:04:08.150 --> 00:04:11.930

 chili flakes but here beds 

00:04:13.070 --> 00:04:16.130
 scratched the truth and fine so that it 

00:04:14.990 --> 00:04:17.480
 balances very well done in logic 

00:04:16.130 --> 00:04:21.079
 fashion yes ok 

00:04:17.480 --> 00:04:23.210

00:04:23.210 --> 00:04:26.390
 half of the panela breads that you see 

00:04:24.740 --> 00:04:28.010
 like two ounces cheese panela in squares 

00:04:26.390 --> 00:04:31.520
 rich medium that gives a lot of freshness 

00:04:28.010 --> 00:04:33.169
 forward we are there is like this one 

00:04:31.520 --> 00:04:37.100
 adif a little bit until we throw a 

00:04:33.169 --> 00:04:39.710
 little bit more to the low powder stand 

00:04:37.100 --> 00:04:42.290

00:04:49.010 --> 00:04:53.930
 we mix it the life that was the bathroom we 

00:04:51.770 --> 00:04:55.759
 we see very delicately 

00:04:53.930 --> 00:04:57.169
 and we're already adorned because we 

00:04:55.759 --> 00:05:00.590
 it stays well short with time 3 

00:04:57.169 --> 00:05:03.400
