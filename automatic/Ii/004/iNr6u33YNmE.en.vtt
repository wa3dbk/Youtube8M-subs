00:00:00.469 --> 00:00:04.920
 the coach is the portal to 

00:00:03.030 --> 00:00:07.890
 Training planning for endurance athletes in the 

00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:10.110
 Internet from your individual information 

00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:13.110
 and requirements become personal 

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:15.000
 Training plans are created behind the scenes 

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:17.359
 stuck with 30 years of experience 

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:19.590
 software- controlled training plan 

00:00:17.359 --> 00:00:21.720
 ambitious runners and triathletes 

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:24.359
 top your go regularly with go coach 

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:25.920
 best times so coach convinced since 

00:00:24.359 --> 00:00:28.490
 For many years the trade press and 

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:31.109
 Excites athletes around the world 

00:00:28.490 --> 00:00:33.600
 this movie shows you how to go with it 

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:36.559
 coach in a comfortable way her training 

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:36.559
 can optimize 

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:40.920
 for the creation of a really 

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:42.930
 individual training plan 

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:45.239
 the coach takes into account, among other things 

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:47.460
 her weight her size 

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:53.010
 state of health and if known 

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:54.600
 your rest pulse and maximum pulse so coach 

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:56.610
 Used for training planning 

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:59.420
 Runs on which they usually 

00:00:56.610 --> 00:00:59.420
 work out 

00:01:00.050 --> 00:01:04.379
 for the assessment of her 

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:06.810
 performance and purpose of the 

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:12.119
 give them their current bests and theirs 

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:14.970
 Goals how often you enter 

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:17.070
 want to train their week 

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:19.110
 assessment of the completed training 

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:20.850
 Last week influences the 

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:23.460
 training schedule for the coming week 

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:25.700
 They can be any number of times 

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:27.780
 Request repeat plans 

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:29.369
 already a few minutes after the 

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:34.290
 Request yours 

00:01:29.369 --> 00:01:36.150
 training plan by e mail as pdf for 

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:37.950
 an optimal training effect 

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:39.829
 not the training tempo crucial 

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:42.390
 but the burden 

00:01:39.829 --> 00:01:44.430
 That's why coach works with a pulse 

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:46.030
 oriented load levels and 

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:48.400
 load units 

00:01:46.030 --> 00:01:51.159
 the load levels are in the 

00:01:48.400 --> 00:01:53.400
 training plan bst called and based 

00:01:51.159 --> 00:01:56.049
 on the rest pulse and the maximum pulse 

00:01:53.400 --> 00:01:59.530
 a load level describes one 

00:01:56.049 --> 00:02:01.540
 certain pulse range the load 

00:01:59.530 --> 00:02:03.190
 units are in the training plan b 

00:02:01.540 --> 00:02:06.159
 called and reflect the 

00:02:03.190 --> 00:02:07.659
 training intensity again and 

00:02:06.159 --> 00:02:09.090
 So the same route can be in 

00:02:07.659 --> 00:02:11.040
 Dependence on the pulse rate 

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:13.060
 be valued differently 

00:02:11.040 --> 00:02:16.680
 this calculation is done automatically 

00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:19.630
 if you document your training 

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:22.120
 a special friend or coaches is 

00:02:19.630 --> 00:02:23.860
 Smiley he comments both that 

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:26.680
 scheduled training next week 

00:02:23.860 --> 00:02:29.830
 as well as the completed training of 

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:31.390
 So smiley should be red last week 

00:02:29.830 --> 00:02:33.450
 he is probably not quite start up 

00:02:31.390 --> 00:02:35.500
 happy with you 

00:02:33.450 --> 00:02:37.569
 in addition to every training plan 

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:42.160
 get individual text hints 

00:02:37.569 --> 00:02:43.870
 each graduated to their training 

00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:44.700
 training session will be online 

00:02:43.870 --> 00:02:47.290
 documented 

00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:49.239
 in addition to the required time is also the 

00:02:47.290 --> 00:02:51.790
 Average pulse registered to you 

00:02:49.239 --> 00:02:53.709
 have measured in their training the 

00:02:51.790 --> 00:02:57.060
 load level and load 

00:02:53.709 --> 00:02:59.380
 Units will determine where coach automatically 

00:02:57.060 --> 00:03:01.360
 based on the completed 

00:02:59.380 --> 00:03:04.900
 Workouts thus create coach 

00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:09.090
 Detailed weekly statistics and one 

00:03:04.900 --> 00:03:09.090
 meaningful annual statistics 

00:03:09.980 --> 00:03:14.340
 You also have the option 

00:03:11.659 --> 00:03:17.510
 special statistics with freely chosen 

00:03:14.340 --> 00:03:17.510
 to create parameters 

00:03:19.970 --> 00:03:24.930
 to control your performance 

00:03:22.370 --> 00:03:28.560
 use the innovative go coach 

00:03:24.930 --> 00:03:30.150
 precondition is that you are on 

00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:32.750
 a certain stretch several 

00:03:30.150 --> 00:03:35.489
 have completed training 

00:03:32.750 --> 00:03:37.260
 with the help of the training duration and the 

00:03:35.489 --> 00:03:39.030
 average pulse rate will be 

00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:41.040
 a graphic representation of the form 

00:03:39.030 --> 00:03:42.870
 Development created so you have 

00:03:41.040 --> 00:03:45.900
 at any time the overview of your form 

00:03:42.870 --> 00:03:47.549
 trend with the help of the shape curve you can 

00:03:45.900 --> 00:03:49.379
 For example, decide if you 

00:03:47.549 --> 00:03:50.970
 next competition only as unimportant 

00:03:49.379 --> 00:03:53.040
 Construction competition should be planned 

00:03:50.970 --> 00:03:57.840
 or if a new best time 

00:03:53.040 --> 00:03:59.760
 could jump out at go coach 

00:03:57.840 --> 00:04:01.700
 you always have the chance to compete 

00:03:59.760 --> 00:04:03.989
 on and off again 

00:04:01.700 --> 00:04:06.170
 it is between important and 

00:04:03.989 --> 00:04:08.549
 unimportant competitive differences 

00:04:06.170 --> 00:04:09.900
 unimportant competitions will be made from 

00:04:08.549 --> 00:04:12.299
 training out denied 

00:04:09.900 --> 00:04:14.459
 On the other hand, important competitions will come to an end 

00:04:12.299 --> 00:04:17.940
 all rules of the training theory and 

00:04:14.459 --> 00:04:20.280
 they have prepared a new one 

00:04:17.940 --> 00:04:22.590
 best time reached congratulations 

00:04:20.280 --> 00:04:25.729
 tell us this with go coach 

00:04:22.590 --> 00:04:25.729

00:04:26.330 --> 00:04:30.110
 use the two-week test phase for 

00:04:28.909 --> 00:04:31.759
