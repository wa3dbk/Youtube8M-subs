00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.420
 i 

00:00:03.680 --> 00:00:09.050
 Hi, I'm Alberto Rodríguez, specialist 

00:00:06.920 --> 00:00:11.830
 of products málaga 8 and we are here with 

00:00:09.050 --> 00:00:15.070
 nicole alvarez to present this 

00:00:11.830 --> 00:00:18.610
 flyer 6-4 from eastwood 

00:00:15.070 --> 00:00:20.650
 you will know him play with light with 

00:00:18.610 --> 00:00:23.210
 varnish currently on tour with the 

00:00:20.650 --> 00:00:25.039
 border a lot of years 

00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:26.530
 and in a bunch of discs is not 

00:00:25.039 --> 00:00:31.770
 collaborated 

00:00:26.530 --> 00:00:31.770
 this is a synthesis of the 60's 

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:37.820
 there are many people who think that it is a 

00:00:34.070 --> 00:00:41.390
 fashion but for the m but it is not one more 

00:00:37.820 --> 00:00:44.600
 roots comes from the unibox brand what 

00:00:41.390 --> 00:00:46.879
 first thing that jumps at sight is that 

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:49.519
 is that the shape of the cowboys is 

00:00:46.879 --> 00:00:52.579
 inverted is very typical because in the 

00:00:49.519 --> 00:00:55.100
 grinds unibox and then then to me 

00:00:52.579 --> 00:00:57.440
 personally I really like the two p 

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:59.809
 90 that they carry because because now we 

00:00:57.440 --> 00:01:02.420
 they will say and a little as it sounds and now what 

00:00:59.809 --> 00:01:03.680
 you will see but then to me you already know and 

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:05.930
 ccoo which is one of the pills that most 

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:10.610
 I like it because it's a bit of a mix 

00:01:05.930 --> 00:01:13.070
 well summarized and said as very very fast 

00:01:10.610 --> 00:01:16.250
 between the fat that has a job that 

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:17.659
 I saw and the definition and the bit about everything 

00:01:16.250 --> 00:01:22.280
 I really like the attack that has the 

00:01:17.659 --> 00:01:24.289
 single equal if pills the p 90 is 

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:26.509
 they did in principle to get more 

00:01:24.289 --> 00:01:28.970
 simple practical signs at the beginning 

00:01:26.509 --> 00:01:31.759
 there were only simple pills and what 

00:01:28.970 --> 00:01:34.970
 contains is a double amount of coil 

00:01:31.759 --> 00:01:36.200
 It has six magnets but it has like in the 

00:01:34.970 --> 00:01:39.909
 amount that would use a jamb that 

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:39.909
 deplores in copper thread 

00:01:40.480 --> 00:01:44.650
 and then what you get is having 

00:01:42.310 --> 00:01:47.650
 much more sign of salteras six weeks 

00:01:44.650 --> 00:01:49.540
 they have a lot of punch does not have so many 

00:01:47.650 --> 00:01:52.900
 you like the prawns 

00:01:49.540 --> 00:01:56.050
 to infinity the beak is more natural 

00:01:52.900 --> 00:01:59.320
 ends a natural way and has a lot 

00:01:56.050 --> 00:02:02.400
 stuck a lot pretty first signal the 

00:01:59.320 --> 00:02:06.430
 bolton was riding on increase 

00:02:02.400 --> 00:02:08.140
 but you have another white version like 

00:02:06.430 --> 00:02:10.320
 with jack with campa that is because 

00:02:08.140 --> 00:02:12.700
 really the pickup on this guitar 

00:02:10.320 --> 00:02:14.260
 it marks it as much then 

00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:18.310
 action and like the people that you like 

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:20.620
 that you really like the hide in the 

00:02:18.310 --> 00:02:22.720
 high saturations and in bras 

00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:25.870
 infinities because maybe this guitar 

00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:27.490
 It is not the best and possibly you 

00:02:25.870 --> 00:02:29.320
 will like more than the one that comes with 

00:02:27.490 --> 00:02:31.450
 Jamb kers clear only by changing the 

00:02:29.320 --> 00:02:33.700
 pills more changes totally not 

00:02:31.450 --> 00:02:35.920
 because electronics already know that here 

00:02:33.700 --> 00:02:37.630
 It influences a lot and I like it 

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:41.140
 too much the bridge is not to say how 

00:02:37.630 --> 00:02:43.060
 very very sixty but only aesthetics 

00:02:41.140 --> 00:02:44.460
 let's see it and then keep talking 

00:02:43.060 --> 00:02:47.460
 little bit 

00:02:44.460 --> 00:02:47.460
 i 

00:02:53.730 --> 00:02:56.730
 the 

00:02:58.769 --> 00:03:01.769
 Y 

00:03:08.110 --> 00:03:11.110
 what 

00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:20.160
 i 

00:03:25.790 --> 00:03:28.790
 n 

00:03:59.920 --> 00:04:04.630
 the 

00:04:02.030 --> 00:04:04.630
 live 

00:04:04.810 --> 00:04:07.380
 to me 

00:04:15.210 --> 00:04:17.780
 Y 

00:04:23.230 --> 00:04:28.330
 i 

00:04:25.430 --> 00:04:28.330
 to me 

00:04:37.160 --> 00:04:39.760
 all right 

00:04:47.340 --> 00:04:54.330
 Well, you can see that the guitar 

00:04:49.440 --> 00:04:56.520
 it works in several various fields both 

00:04:54.330 --> 00:04:58.919
 both very clean things like now the 

00:04:56.520 --> 00:05:03.060
 movie saturates a tad and sounds something 

00:04:58.919 --> 00:05:05.280
 very fair in that sound of the dry season 

00:05:03.060 --> 00:05:07.949
 delicate national of the 60s principle 

00:05:05.280 --> 00:05:09.449
 the 70s and the truth that the guitar 

00:05:07.949 --> 00:05:11.310
 it responds very well also so that the 

00:05:09.449 --> 00:05:12.660
 people see that not only three guitars 

00:05:11.310 --> 00:05:14.550
 clean sounds although we usually 

00:05:12.660 --> 00:05:16.460
 record clean content so that for 

00:05:14.550 --> 00:05:20.419
 that you see how is the 

00:05:16.460 --> 00:05:21.919
 is the sound originally say that 

00:05:20.419 --> 00:05:23.280
 everything we can expect a wait 

00:05:21.919 --> 00:05:26.520
 sale no 

00:05:23.280 --> 00:05:28.410
 very good support very as if I had 

00:05:26.520 --> 00:05:31.200
 compressor but without being a compressor 

00:05:28.410 --> 00:05:33.150
 without giving peaks in none at all 

00:05:31.200 --> 00:05:35.370
 part of the mast and the truth that very 

00:05:33.150 --> 00:05:37.050
 round the sound very warm not so much 

00:05:35.370 --> 00:05:38.760
 they exist as a commune ham barkero but 

00:05:37.050 --> 00:05:40.590
 really what student friend said 

00:05:38.760 --> 00:05:42.210
 came in the cowboy cam and I think 

00:05:40.590 --> 00:05:44.490
 even at the end a little artificial already 

00:05:42.210 --> 00:05:45.690
 almost not what does not mean that the 

00:05:44.490 --> 00:05:47.370
 cam so they do not sound good and they are 

00:05:45.690 --> 00:05:49.230
 artificial but I want to say that for 

00:05:47.370 --> 00:05:51.750
 me for my personal taste it seems to me already 

00:05:49.230 --> 00:05:54.150
 that there is a bit more samba that is 

00:05:51.750 --> 00:05:56.280
 the bases that were actually made 

00:05:54.150 --> 00:05:59.520
 for that to have an infinite bra 

00:05:56.280 --> 00:06:01.800
 well that it was not real but you 

00:05:59.520 --> 00:06:05.010
 cut it and the other pills the 

00:06:01.800 --> 00:06:06.630
 intention is that they sound like like 

00:06:05.010 --> 00:06:09.090
 be microphones with the same letters 

00:06:06.630 --> 00:06:10.980
 originals and that have a dynamic a 

00:06:09.090 --> 00:06:12.810
 little more natural and that the rope ends 

00:06:10.980 --> 00:06:14.550
 to heal when when really 

00:06:12.810 --> 00:06:16.950
 determined to vibrate that we mean 

00:06:14.550 --> 00:06:19.770
 with a little more natural really what 

00:06:16.950 --> 00:06:21.720
 says nico apart from the samba that if 

00:06:19.770 --> 00:06:24.270
 they invented to remove the amp not 

00:06:21.720 --> 00:06:26.940
 understand the noise this is why that's why 

00:06:24.270 --> 00:06:28.440
 really when today in these demos 

00:06:26.940 --> 00:06:31.050
 a little noise 

00:06:28.440 --> 00:06:32.910
 Of course it is logical and normal 

00:06:31.050 --> 00:06:38.010
 all the patients without him even 

00:06:32.910 --> 00:06:40.290
 even p 90 have attached to their 

00:06:38.010 --> 00:06:42.930
 channel that all the cells do not defend 

00:06:40.290 --> 00:06:45.300
 always all musicians know that 

00:06:42.930 --> 00:06:47.580
 the fender guitars have that that 

00:06:45.300 --> 00:06:49.200
 always characteristic background noise 

00:06:47.580 --> 00:06:51.210
 pills for itself but for 

00:06:49.200 --> 00:06:52.860
 another side is in guitars with which 

00:06:51.210 --> 00:06:54.840
 they have recorded all the records that we 

00:06:52.860 --> 00:06:57.030
 like input and leadership 

00:06:54.840 --> 00:06:58.290
 the whole history of music that we 

00:06:57.030 --> 00:07:01.290
 like they have recorded with those noises 

00:06:58.290 --> 00:07:02.760
 also since sometimes arrived at 

00:07:01.290 --> 00:07:06.139
 this point now with systems 

00:07:02.760 --> 00:07:08.840
 recording maybe we become a bit 

00:07:06.139 --> 00:07:10.090
 maniacs very well many hobbies 

00:07:08.840 --> 00:07:13.810
 computer 

00:07:10.090 --> 00:07:16.039
 so good if it's to the pills 

00:07:13.810 --> 00:07:17.120
 singles because it will always always cost 

00:07:16.039 --> 00:07:19.819
 a little bit its character a little noise 

00:07:17.120 --> 00:07:21.860
 but but it is what is apart from me 

00:07:19.819 --> 00:07:24.349
 honestly do not get upset either 

00:07:21.860 --> 00:07:25.940
 it's just the one with the guitar 

00:07:24.349 --> 00:07:29.360
 lifetime 

00:07:25.940 --> 00:07:30.620
