 I was thrown in a construction my 

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:51.840
 father went through the construction and I look 

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:54.560
 that the puppy was totally in a 

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:57.360
 rain abandoned athens and well what 

00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:59.610
 he picked it up he got his vehicle and well 

00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:01.740
 they bring us here and we all 

00:00:59.610 --> 00:01:05.760
 we adopt 

00:01:01.740 --> 00:01:08.130
 obviously its treatment 

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:11.190
 antiparasitic veterinarian is 

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:15.680
 sterilized and now is our company 

00:01:11.190 --> 00:01:15.680
 and is the spoiled of my dad of the 

00:01:17.500 --> 00:01:23.750
 this lucas was abandoned in a 

00:01:21.110 --> 00:01:25.420
 park instead my nephew who 

00:01:23.750 --> 00:01:27.460
 also has 

00:01:25.420 --> 00:01:28.790
 my nephew who also has the same 

00:01:27.460 --> 00:01:35.200
 genes 

00:01:28.790 --> 00:01:38.649
 so they know him then he is 

00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:41.229
 he is the lucas was also abandoned 

00:01:38.649 --> 00:01:43.270
 in a park my nephew who is like 

00:01:41.229 --> 00:01:46.329
 identify with our cause well what 

00:01:43.270 --> 00:01:48.210
 he picked him up himself to the bus but 

00:01:46.329 --> 00:01:50.979
 I was a little boy 

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:53.920
 and well he saved it because he was about 

00:01:50.979 --> 00:01:56.110
 to cross the street and have run over 

00:01:53.920 --> 00:01:57.549
 some vehicle brought him to the house 

00:01:56.110 --> 00:01:59.469
 since it is part of our family 

00:01:57.549 --> 00:02:03.700
 you also have to make a shelter and 

00:01:59.469 --> 00:02:07.000
 jorge that if we did this always I 

00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:10.299
 I am identified, we would say, I am an animal 

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:12.880
 but my brother who got ahead of me 

00:02:10.299 --> 00:02:16.290
 in this path of medical profession 

00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:19.510
 he also taught us a little is 

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:22.989
 this mystique of creating a refuge not 

00:02:19.510 --> 00:02:24.910
 collected from dogs and cats collected 

00:02:22.989 --> 00:02:28.180
 always is already home and as 

00:02:24.910 --> 00:02:30.670
 we are very close to the 

00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:32.950
 animals, we collect them and the 

00:02:30.670 --> 00:02:34.780
 we integrate our family as 

00:02:32.950 --> 00:02:36.880
 you can see jorge se 

00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:39.220
 find one of your prized 

00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:40.600
 animals in fact going to be bojan we are going to 

00:02:39.220 --> 00:02:42.150
 make incidents as it is one of the most 

00:02:40.600 --> 00:02:44.909
 pampered 

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:47.340
 uy look at you this project is left 

00:02:44.909 --> 00:02:50.159
 mccoy so let's ask Jorge 

00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:52.620
 tell us why the name and a 

00:02:50.159 --> 00:02:54.930
 little of the wii story that you have in 

00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:58.680
 your arms good this puppy is 

00:02:54.930 --> 00:03:00.689
 barcelonista and is a boy monkey they gave him 

00:02:58.680 --> 00:03:02.689
 in the city of guayaquil has a 

00:03:00.689 --> 00:03:05.459
 very important story for us 

00:03:02.689 --> 00:03:08.849
 because this puppy was destined 

00:03:05.459 --> 00:03:11.280
 to give him a brother of mine who does 

00:03:08.849 --> 00:03:14.879
 more than three years since he left us 

00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:17.400
 He advanced on the road and when he no longer 

00:03:14.879 --> 00:03:19.530
 he could have it because he was just born 

00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:22.200
 Well, the lady who had offered 

00:03:19.530 --> 00:03:24.959
 he came and told me and here is the puppy 

00:03:22.200 --> 00:03:26.459
 that was for him then in those 

00:03:24.959 --> 00:03:29.770
 moments of pain that we were going through 

00:03:26.459 --> 00:03:32.590
 We brought him from the city of Quito 

00:03:29.770 --> 00:03:34.990
 I thought it was a guinea pig why it was so 

00:03:32.590 --> 00:03:37.420
 little one that he gave me that he had in the 

00:03:34.990 --> 00:03:40.330
 palm of the hand told him it is a kwh and 

00:03:37.420 --> 00:03:43.420
 it does not say it's a puppy then it seemed 

00:03:40.330 --> 00:03:46.090
 those Peruvian guinea pigs but very hairy and 

00:03:43.420 --> 00:03:47.790
 there we put the name kwh and despite 

00:03:46.090 --> 00:03:50.740
 who does not live with me lives with my mom 

00:03:47.790 --> 00:03:53.890
 this follows me everywhere is a bit 

00:03:50.740 --> 00:03:56.980
 of a chemistry that we have that came 

00:03:53.890 --> 00:03:59.200
 where my mom does not detach from me and I 

00:03:56.980 --> 00:04:03.490
 I get on the car he climbs up with me 

00:03:59.200 --> 00:04:05.860
 it came out and well that's mutual the 

00:04:03.490 --> 00:04:09.730
 affection that we have, I want everyone 

00:04:05.860 --> 00:04:13.180
 my my four-legged friends but this one 

00:04:09.730 --> 00:04:15.160
 this is a little more related is the correct 

00:04:13.180 --> 00:04:23.560
 with me 

00:04:15.160 --> 00:04:27.490
 and what reasons did you give us of what 

00:04:23.560 --> 00:04:30.600
 it's the market because it 's a mosque 

00:04:27.490 --> 00:04:34.260
 some races have something of Castilian 

00:04:30.600 --> 00:04:34.260
 possibly has something of 

00:04:34.430 --> 00:04:39.560
 snow be I do not know then out there is 

00:04:37.460 --> 00:04:41.900
 mixed and you have to ask the doctor 

00:04:39.560 --> 00:04:44.960
 pet that please tell us what race 

00:04:41.900 --> 00:04:47.420
 of puppy is this moment we 

00:04:44.960 --> 00:04:49.370
 we find with pupo egg also has 

00:04:47.420 --> 00:04:51.280
 of course a story that we the 

00:04:49.370 --> 00:04:54.970
 immediately count on jorge youtube 

00:04:51.280 --> 00:04:57.980
 we lived in the center of Quito 

00:04:54.970 --> 00:05:01.070
 just in the avenue May 24 in 

00:04:57.980 --> 00:05:03.320
 sant roc and one day we went out with my 

00:05:01.070 --> 00:05:07.690
 brother and we gave this puppy 

00:05:03.320 --> 00:05:10.520
 abandoned there in the middle of the avenue and 

00:05:07.690 --> 00:05:13.880
 obviously he was entangled 

00:05:10.520 --> 00:05:16.490
 in some wires there, even 

00:05:13.880 --> 00:05:18.260
 some of barbs and he was defending himself and 

00:05:16.490 --> 00:05:22.310
 I was there abandoned 

00:05:18.260 --> 00:05:25.310
 then there my brother picked us up 

00:05:22.310 --> 00:05:28.670
 he had it at home throughout the 

00:05:25.310 --> 00:05:30.770
 time and my brother left three 

00:05:28.670 --> 00:05:34.220
 years and a half and obviously 

00:05:30.770 --> 00:05:37.220
 we keep taking care of him is the 

00:05:34.220 --> 00:05:41.000
 pet of a loved one who is no longer 

00:05:37.220 --> 00:05:43.580
 with us but at least while 

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:46.010
 with him like they relieve us a little 

00:05:43.580 --> 00:05:48.740
 that pain because the name of little he 

00:05:46.010 --> 00:05:50.320
 put my brother put him pupa I do not know such 

00:05:48.740 --> 00:05:52.760
 time for him 

00:05:50.320 --> 00:05:56.510
 we are in the navel of the world will there be 

00:05:52.760 --> 00:05:57.890
 put pupo again because he thought 

00:05:56.510 --> 00:06:01.940
 a dog of the carche if they are told 

00:05:57.890 --> 00:06:04.250
 affectionately to the carchenses friends 

00:06:01.940 --> 00:06:05.870
 well, we said goodbye to friendly friends. 

00:06:04.250 --> 00:06:07.730
 shared a very pleasant minutes 

00:06:05.870 --> 00:06:10.220
 with Jorge and one of Machado with this 

00:06:07.730 --> 00:06:11.930
 number of puppies the pets part of 

00:06:10.220 --> 00:06:13.850
 his family and with the commitment 

00:06:11.930 --> 00:06:16.150
 again that if it comes Jorge 

00:06:13.850 --> 00:06:19.160
 to the assembly as we hope it will be 

00:06:16.150 --> 00:06:20.990
 fight and work for that law of 

00:06:19.160 --> 00:06:23.060
 protection of these beings that so much 

00:06:20.990 --> 00:06:25.220
 they need and for that surely they are going to 

00:06:23.060 --> 00:06:28.130
 count on the help but it's also going to 

00:06:25.220 --> 00:06:30.470
 count on the pressure and with the 

00:06:28.130 --> 00:06:33.910
 monitoring or oversight of many who 

00:06:30.470 --> 00:06:33.910
 let's give the vote for you
