underdog<00:03:09.550> this<00:03:09.760> year<00:03:10.000> I<00:03:10.180> think<00:03:10.300> this<00:03:10.750> game

00:03:10.890 --> 00:03:10.900 
underdog this year I think this game

00:03:10.900 --> 00:03:13.229 
underdog this year I think this game
comes<00:03:11.170> down<00:03:11.470> to<00:03:11.739> rebounding<00:03:12.670> I<00:03:12.820> don't<00:03:13.000> think

00:03:13.229 --> 00:03:13.239 
comes down to rebounding I don't think

00:03:13.239 --> 00:03:15.060 
comes down to rebounding I don't think
the<00:03:13.330> Miami<00:03:13.630> Heat<00:03:13.840> measure<00:03:14.530> up<00:03:14.800> in<00:03:14.950> that

00:03:15.060 --> 00:03:15.070 
the Miami Heat measure up in that

00:03:15.070 --> 00:03:17.970 
the Miami Heat measure up in that

season-high 22 offensive rebounds in the
last<00:03:20.950> meeting<00:03:21.250> I<00:03:21.519> think<00:03:22.000> that<00:03:22.150> means<00:03:22.390> that

00:03:22.590 --> 00:03:22.600 
last meeting I think that means that

00:03:22.600 --> 00:03:24.180 
last meeting I think that means that
LeBron<00:03:22.900> James<00:03:23.200> is<00:03:23.380> gonna<00:03:23.470> have<00:03:23.650> to<00:03:23.709> spend<00:03:23.920> more

00:03:26.850 --> 00:03:26.860 
time on the defensive glass and less

00:03:26.860 --> 00:03:28.530 
time on the defensive glass and less
time<00:03:27.130> worrying<00:03:27.430> about<00:03:27.610> scoring<00:03:28.090> this<00:03:28.330> game

00:03:28.530 --> 00:03:28.540 
time worrying about scoring this game

00:03:28.540 --> 00:03:30.900 
time worrying about scoring this game
and<00:03:28.750> that's<00:03:29.080> not<00:03:29.350> a<00:03:29.410> good<00:03:29.530> thing<00:03:29.739> when<00:03:30.220> trying

00:03:30.900 --> 00:03:30.910 
and that's not a good thing when trying

00:03:30.910 --> 00:03:33.360
