00:00:23.600 --> 00:00:26.450 

okay<00:00:24.600> so<00:00:24.660> in<00:00:24.960> this<00:00:25.050> video<00:00:25.260> we<00:00:25.920> are<00:00:25.950> going<00:00:26.039> to

00:00:26.450 --> 00:00:26.460 
okay so in this video we are going to

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:31.600 
okay so in this video we are going to
set<00:00:26.820> this<00:00:27.210> one<00:00:27.480> to<00:00:28.939> 100<00:00:29.939> so<00:00:30.509> you<00:00:30.570> can<00:00:30.990> see<00:00:31.230> I

00:00:31.600 --> 00:00:31.610 
set this one to 100 so you can see I

00:00:31.610 --> 00:00:36.229 
set this one to 100 so you can see I
have<00:00:32.610> said<00:00:33.059> it<00:00:33.180> now<00:00:33.390> press<00:00:33.870> this<00:00:34.050> one<00:00:34.320> and<00:00:35.239> I'm

00:00:36.229 --> 00:00:36.239 
have said it now press this one and I'm

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:38.630 
have said it now press this one and I'm
putting<00:00:36.540> it<00:00:36.660> on<00:00:36.890> 100<00:00:37.890> which<00:00:38.160> means<00:00:38.430> we're

00:00:38.630 --> 00:00:38.640 
putting it on 100 which means we're

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:40.009 
putting it on 100 which means we're
going<00:00:38.790> to<00:00:38.850> have<00:00:38.910> much<00:00:39.210> more<00:00:39.269> sensitive

00:00:40.009 --> 00:00:40.019 
going to have much more sensitive

00:00:40.019 --> 00:00:44.090 
going to have much more sensitive
controls<00:00:40.410> and<00:00:42.260> what's<00:00:43.260> you<00:00:43.769> know<00:00:43.860> much<00:00:44.070> more

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:44.100 
controls and what's you know much more

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:46.280 
controls and what's you know much more
sensitive<00:00:44.519> controls<00:00:44.879> and<00:00:45.360> it<00:00:45.510> should<00:00:45.780> be<00:00:46.050> a

00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:46.290 
sensitive controls and it should be a

00:00:46.290 --> 00:00:49.939 
sensitive controls and it should be a
lot<00:00:46.320> more<00:00:46.620> fun<00:00:47.160> to<00:00:47.400> fly<00:00:47.670> now<00:00:47.910> actually<00:00:48.890> ok<00:00:49.890> so

00:00:49.939 --> 00:00:49.949 
lot more fun to fly now actually ok so

00:00:49.949 --> 00:00:57.020 
lot more fun to fly now actually ok so
here<00:00:50.400> we<00:00:50.489> go<00:00:50.519> how<00:00:51.059> to<00:00:51.120> see<00:00:51.420> how<00:00:51.690> it<00:00:51.839> flies<00:00:56.030> so

00:00:57.020 --> 00:00:57.030 
here we go how to see how it flies so

00:00:57.030 --> 00:01:00.340 
here we go how to see how it flies so
it's<00:00:57.239> much<00:00:57.510> more<00:00:57.539> sensitive<00:00:58.230> as<00:00:58.680> I<00:00:58.800> just<00:00:58.829> said

00:01:00.340 --> 00:01:00.350 
it's much more sensitive as I just said

00:01:00.350 --> 00:01:04.760 
it's much more sensitive as I just said
whoo<00:01:01.350> and<00:01:02.420> actually<00:01:03.420> like<00:01:03.840> this<00:01:04.110> it's<00:01:04.500> going

00:01:04.760 --> 00:01:04.770 
whoo and actually like this it's going

00:01:04.770 --> 00:01:10.930 
whoo and actually like this it's going
to<00:01:04.860> take<00:01:05.039> some<00:01:05.180> serious<00:01:06.180> spinning<00:01:06.690> you<00:01:06.930> slee

00:01:10.930 --> 00:01:10.940 

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:46.290 

everything<00:01:11.940> it<00:01:12.060> is<00:01:12.149> very<00:01:12.509> very<00:01:12.600> sensitive<00:01:13.500> now

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:46.300 

00:01:46.300 --> 00:01:52.350 

just<00:01:46.930> adjusting<00:01:47.560> the<00:01:47.680> terms<00:01:47.950> a<00:01:48.190> bit

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:52.360 

00:01:52.360 --> 00:01:54.540 

and<00:01:52.960> now<00:01:53.200> we<00:01:53.260> are<00:01:53.410> hovering<00:01:53.680> without<00:01:54.220> any

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:54.550 
and now we are hovering without any

00:01:54.550 --> 00:02:05.210 
and now we are hovering without any
radio<00:01:55.330> controls<00:01:55.900> at<00:01:56.170> all

00:02:05.210 --> 00:02:05.220 

00:02:05.220 --> 00:02:08.120 

so<00:02:05.790> considering<00:02:06.510> that<00:02:06.780> will<00:02:07.140> carry<00:02:07.410> charges

00:02:08.120 --> 00:02:08.130 
so considering that will carry charges

00:02:08.130 --> 00:02:10.219 
so considering that will carry charges
like<00:02:08.430> four<00:02:08.759> times<00:02:09.030> the<00:02:09.300> price<00:02:09.479> for<00:02:09.960> their

00:02:10.219 --> 00:02:10.229 
like four times the price for their

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:15.470 
like four times the price for their
ladybug<00:02:10.770> I<00:02:11.570> think<00:02:12.570> that<00:02:12.810> the<00:02:13.070> wltoys<00:02:14.240> v<00:02:15.240> nine

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:15.480 
ladybug I think that the wltoys v nine

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:21.460 
ladybug I think that the wltoys v nine
to<00:02:15.870> nine<00:02:16.110> is<00:02:17.360> a<00:02:18.360> much<00:02:18.660> better<00:02:18.690> choice<00:02:20.270> to<00:02:21.270> make

00:02:21.460 --> 00:02:21.470 
to nine is a much better choice to make

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:25.880 
to nine is a much better choice to make
because<00:02:22.470> it's<00:02:23.040> much<00:02:23.310> cheaper<00:02:23.340> and<00:02:24.890> the

00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:25.890 
because it's much cheaper and the

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:28.370 
because it's much cheaper and the
stability<00:02:26.160> is<00:02:26.790> awesome<00:02:27.420> and<00:02:28.020> it<00:02:28.200> does

00:02:28.370 --> 00:02:28.380 
stability is awesome and it does

00:02:28.380 --> 00:02:30.710 
stability is awesome and it does
everything<00:02:28.890> that<00:02:29.460> people<00:02:29.640> care<00:02:30.180> a<00:02:30.210> ladybird

00:02:30.710 --> 00:02:30.720 
everything that people care a ladybird

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:33.860 
everything that people care a ladybird
will<00:02:31.050> do<00:02:31.910> so<00:02:32.910> now<00:02:33.150> we've<00:02:33.330> got<00:02:33.510> much<00:02:33.690> more

00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:33.870 
will do so now we've got much more

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:38.290 
will do so now we've got much more
sensitive<00:02:34.260> controls<00:02:34.740> it's<00:02:35.190> easier<00:02:35.670> to<00:02:35.820> fly

00:02:38.290 --> 00:02:38.300 

00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:44.420 

very<00:02:39.300> sensitive<00:02:40.260> and<00:02:40.910> responsive<00:02:43.190> now<00:02:44.190> that

00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:44.430 
very sensitive and responsive now that

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:51.110 
very sensitive and responsive now that
it's<00:02:44.610> on<00:02:44.790> this<00:02:45.090> setting<00:02:49.250> the<00:02:50.250> flight<00:02:50.580> forward

00:02:51.110 --> 00:02:51.120 
it's on this setting the flight forward

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:59.690 
it's on this setting the flight forward
and<00:02:51.240> backwards<00:02:51.660> is<00:02:51.810> much<00:02:52.020> faster<00:02:52.290> now

00:02:59.690 --> 00:02:59.700 

00:02:59.700 --> 00:03:09.330 

lots<00:03:00.390> of<00:03:00.510> response<00:03:00.930> is<00:03:01.140> very<00:03:01.230> powerful

00:03:09.330 --> 00:03:09.340 

00:03:09.340 --> 00:03:12.869 

and<00:03:09.940> I<00:03:10.000> just<00:03:10.239> demonstrating<00:03:11.170> just<00:03:11.489> how<00:03:12.489> fast

00:03:12.869 --> 00:03:12.879 
and I just demonstrating just how fast

00:03:12.879 --> 00:03:16.309 
and I just demonstrating just how fast
this<00:03:13.269> one<00:03:13.510> will<00:03:13.690> actually<00:03:13.720> fly<00:03:14.470> outdoors

00:03:16.309 --> 00:03:16.319 
this one will actually fly outdoors

00:03:16.319 --> 00:03:22.229 
this one will actually fly outdoors
indoors<00:03:17.319> it<00:03:17.980> seems<00:03:18.370> very<00:03:19.200> rock<00:03:20.200> solid<00:03:20.530> and<00:03:21.239> you

00:03:22.229 --> 00:03:22.239 
indoors it seems very rock solid and you

00:03:22.239 --> 00:03:30.080 
indoors it seems very rock solid and you
can<00:03:22.390> see<00:03:23.760> very<00:03:24.760> powerful<00:03:28.140> outdoors<00:03:29.140> I'm<00:03:29.530> sure

00:03:30.080 --> 00:03:30.090 
can see very powerful outdoors I'm sure

00:03:30.090 --> 00:03:43.240 
can see very powerful outdoors I'm sure
they<00:03:31.090> will<00:03:31.209> fly<00:03:31.390> very<00:03:31.989> very<00:03:32.290> fast<00:03:35.129> blue

00:03:43.240 --> 00:03:43.250 

00:03:43.250 --> 00:03:45.760 

and<00:03:43.880> also<00:03:44.180> remember<00:03:44.840> this<00:03:44.990> is<00:03:45.230> on<00:03:45.500> the

00:03:45.760 --> 00:03:45.770 
and also remember this is on the

00:03:45.770 --> 00:03:47.950 
and also remember this is on the
flipmode<00:03:46.580> when<00:03:47.000> it's<00:03:47.150> on<00:03:47.330> one<00:03:47.600> hundred

00:03:47.950 --> 00:03:47.960 
flipmode when it's on one hundred

00:03:47.960 --> 00:03:52.000 
flipmode when it's on one hundred
percent<00:03:49.240> on<00:03:50.240> the<00:03:50.420> radio<00:03:50.720> it<00:03:51.110> actually<00:03:51.470> means

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:52.010 
percent on the radio it actually means

00:03:52.010 --> 00:03:54.850 
percent on the radio it actually means
it's<00:03:52.190> on<00:03:52.370> the<00:03:52.520> flip<00:03:52.850> mode<00:03:53.150> off<00:03:53.680> because<00:03:54.680> this

00:03:54.850 --> 00:03:54.860 
it's on the flip mode off because this

00:03:54.860 --> 00:03:57.970 
it's on the flip mode off because this
one<00:03:55.130> can<00:03:55.520> do<00:03:55.790> stunts<00:03:56.420> like<00:03:56.660> flips<00:03:57.110> and<00:03:57.470> rolls

00:03:57.970 --> 00:03:57.980 
one can do stunts like flips and rolls

00:03:57.980 --> 00:04:02.230 
one can do stunts like flips and rolls
etc<00:03:59.650> when<00:04:00.650> you<00:04:00.800> have<00:04:01.010> a<00:04:01.040> big<00:04:01.370> enough<00:04:01.610> outdoor

00:04:02.230 --> 00:04:02.240 
etc when you have a big enough outdoor

00:04:02.240 --> 00:04:15.690 
etc when you have a big enough outdoor
or<00:04:02.570> big<00:04:02.990> enough<00:04:03.200> indoor<00:04:03.650> area

00:04:15.690 --> 00:04:15.700 

00:04:15.700 --> 00:04:17.900 

I<00:04:15.790> guess<00:04:16.450> I<00:04:16.630> think<00:04:16.810> I'm<00:04:16.900> going<00:04:17.049> to<00:04:17.109> land<00:04:17.320> it

00:04:17.900 --> 00:04:17.910 
I guess I think I'm going to land it

00:04:17.910 --> 00:04:21.230 
I guess I think I'm going to land it
this<00:04:18.910> experiment<00:04:19.419> was<00:04:19.900> very<00:04:20.260> successful

00:04:21.230 --> 00:04:21.240 
this experiment was very successful

00:04:21.240 --> 00:04:23.640 
this experiment was very successful
previously<00:04:22.240> on<00:04:22.330> the<00:04:22.480> twenty<00:04:22.780> percent<00:04:23.080> I<00:04:23.380> was

00:04:23.640 --> 00:04:23.650 
previously on the twenty percent I was

00:04:23.650 --> 00:04:27.000 
previously on the twenty percent I was
thinking<00:04:24.070> how<00:04:24.340> slowly<00:04:24.880> and<00:04:25.660> unresponsive<00:04:26.590> the

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:27.010 
thinking how slowly and unresponsive the

00:04:27.010 --> 00:04:30.300 
thinking how slowly and unresponsive the
controls<00:04:27.460> were<00:04:27.700> but<00:04:28.480> now<00:04:28.510> this<00:04:29.200> thing<00:04:29.230> is<00:04:29.710> very

00:04:30.300 --> 00:04:30.310 
controls were but now this thing is very

00:04:30.310 --> 00:04:35.760 
controls were but now this thing is very
very<00:04:30.820> nice<00:04:31.780> to<00:04:32.200> fly<00:04:32.470> and<00:04:34.410> much<00:04:35.410> more

00:04:35.760 --> 00:04:35.770 
very nice to fly and much more
