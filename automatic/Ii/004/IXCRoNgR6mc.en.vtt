00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:44.430 
something along those lines obviously

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:46.280 
something along those lines obviously
probably<00:02:45.150> make<00:02:45.269> it<00:02:45.389> a<00:02:45.450> bit<00:02:45.629> more<00:02:45.659> kind<00:02:46.139> of

00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:46.290 
probably make it a bit more kind of

00:02:46.290 --> 00:02:48.020 
probably make it a bit more kind of
uplifting<00:02:46.530> than<00:02:46.680> that<00:02:46.889> but<00:02:47.099> yeah<00:02:47.310> like<00:02:47.790> I<00:02:47.819> said

00:02:58.190 --> 00:02:58.200 
continue along this vein and then when

00:02:58.200 --> 00:03:00.199 
continue along this vein and then when
it<00:02:58.319> comes<00:02:58.500> to<00:02:58.650> testing<00:02:59.069> I<00:02:59.310> can<00:02:59.519> translate<00:02:59.909> this

00:03:00.199 --> 00:03:00.209 
it comes to testing I can translate this

00:03:00.209 --> 00:03:03.440

into<00:03:00.450> a<00:03:00.750> deadlift<00:03:01.470> PR<00:03:01.950> which<00:03:02.220> would<00:03:02.430> be<00:03:02.579> so

00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:03.450 
into a deadlift PR which would be so

00:03:03.450 --> 00:03:05.569 
into a deadlift PR which would be so
good<00:03:03.689> that<00:03:03.870> is<00:03:03.959> obviously<00:03:04.260> a<00:03:04.319> set<00:03:04.650> rep<00:03:04.980> PR<00:03:05.310> but

00:03:05.569 --> 00:03:05.579
