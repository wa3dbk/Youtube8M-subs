 has a view not too much from the stage the monochrome display always rules the 

00:02:39.899 --> 00:02:43.699
 choice is better given its readable 

00:02:44.259 --> 00:02:48.690
 let's open the phone let's see how the alphanumeric keyboard is 

00:02:48.690 --> 00:02:51.539

 very large phone on the left side 

00:06:30.830 --> 00:06:35.240
 % a phone that obviously should not be judged by display for 

00:06:35.240 --> 00:06:36.300
 features 

00:06:36.300 --> 00:06:40.080

00:06:56.129 --> 00:06:57.690
 phone but because it was 

00:06:57.690 --> 00:07:00.230
 charging then large faces from 

00:07:00.230 --> 00:07:05.810
 then insert a phone that was designed not for personal use 

00:07:05.810 --> 00:07:06.860
 it works very well
