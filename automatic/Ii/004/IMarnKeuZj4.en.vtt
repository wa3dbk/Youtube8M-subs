all right so just take the rack off the
top<00:01:31.430> of<00:01:31.610> the<00:01:31.670> car<00:01:32.320> next<00:01:33.320> thing<00:01:33.560> we're<00:01:33.710> going<00:01:33.799> to

00:01:33.850 --> 00:01:33.860 
top of the car next thing we're going to

00:01:33.860 --> 00:01:36.550 
top of the car next thing we're going to
do<00:01:34.040> fill<00:01:34.460> system<00:01:34.880> most<00:01:35.330> important<00:01:35.900> you're

00:01:36.550 --> 00:01:36.560 
do fill system most important you're

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:37.990 
do fill system most important you're
going<00:01:36.680> to<00:01:36.740> want<00:01:36.860> to<00:01:36.920> put<00:01:37.070> an<00:01:37.190> additive<00:01:37.610> like<00:01:37.970> a

00:01:37.990 --> 00:01:38.000 
going to want to put an additive like a

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:39.910 
going to want to put an additive like a
stabilizer<00:01:38.600> in<00:01:38.990> there<00:01:39.229> to<00:01:39.440> prevent<00:01:39.740> it<00:01:39.890> from

00:01:39.910 --> 00:01:39.920 
stabilizer in there to prevent it from

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:42.969 
stabilizer in there to prevent it from
getting<00:01:40.130> all<00:01:40.400> gummy<00:01:40.759> or<00:01:41.440> stopping<00:01:42.440> causing

00:01:42.969 --> 00:01:42.979 
getting all gummy or stopping causing

00:01:42.979 --> 00:01:45.070 
getting all gummy or stopping causing
all<00:01:43.040> sorts<00:01:43.070> of<00:01:43.369> problems<00:01:43.430> also<00:01:44.330> your<00:01:44.659> gas<00:01:44.840> can

00:01:45.070 --> 00:01:45.080 
all sorts of problems also your gas can

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:46.690 
all sorts of problems also your gas can
go<00:01:45.229> flat<00:01:45.649> if<00:01:45.920> you<00:01:46.070> leave<00:01:46.220> it<00:01:46.310> for<00:01:46.369> a<00:01:46.520> long<00:01:46.670> time

00:01:46.690 --> 00:01:46.700 
go flat if you leave it for a long time

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:49.630 
go flat if you leave it for a long time
which<00:01:47.149> means<00:01:47.330> losing<00:01:47.810> its<00:01:47.899> octane<00:01:48.409> level<00:01:48.770> so

00:01:49.630 --> 00:01:49.640 
which means losing its octane level so

00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:52.120 
which means losing its octane level so
this<00:01:49.759> is<00:01:50.000> the<00:01:50.750> additive<00:01:51.649> we're<00:01:51.830> going<00:01:51.950> to<00:01:52.040> be

00:01:52.120 --> 00:01:52.130 
this is the additive we're going to be

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:54.160 
this is the additive we're going to be
using<00:01:52.430> Corrine<00:01:52.759> formula<00:01:53.270> stable<00:01:53.750> ethanol

00:01:54.160 --> 00:01:54.170 
using Corrine formula stable ethanol

00:01:54.170 --> 00:02:00.520 
using Corrine formula stable ethanol
treatment<00:01:55.060> treats<00:01:56.060> up<00:01:56.270> to<00:01:58.000> 320<00:01:59.000> gallons<00:01:59.530> and

00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:00.530 
treatment treats up to 320 gallons and

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:04.900 
treatment treats up to 320 gallons and
on<00:02:00.950> the<00:02:01.100> back<00:02:01.369> here<00:02:01.880> it<00:02:02.390> says<00:02:02.720> one<00:02:03.289> ounce<00:02:03.910> 310

00:02:04.900 --> 00:02:04.910 
on the back here it says one ounce 310

00:02:04.910 --> 00:02:08.380 
on the back here it says one ounce 310
gallons<00:02:05.360> or<00:02:05.600> 38<00:02:06.170> liters<00:02:06.580> so<00:02:07.580> we're<00:02:08.179> going<00:02:08.330> to

00:02:08.380 --> 00:02:08.390 
gallons or 38 liters so we're going to

00:02:08.390 --> 00:02:10.300 
gallons or 38 liters so we're going to
be<00:02:08.539> putting<00:02:08.929> in<00:02:09.019> about<00:02:09.289> an<00:02:09.530> ounce<00:02:09.800> and<00:02:10.220> a<00:02:10.280> half

00:02:10.300 --> 00:02:10.310 
be putting in about an ounce and a half

00:02:10.310 --> 00:02:17.309 
be putting in about an ounce and a half
in<00:02:10.789> here<00:02:11.060> and<00:02:12.040> the<00:02:13.040> way<00:02:13.510> that<00:02:14.510> we<00:02:14.750> measure<00:02:15.019> it

00:02:17.309 --> 00:02:17.319 
in here and the way that we measure it

00:02:17.319 --> 00:02:20.890 
in here and the way that we measure it
pretty<00:02:18.319> cool<00:02:18.650> on<00:02:18.739> this<00:02:18.860> bottle<00:02:19.340> all<00:02:19.690> you<00:02:20.690> gotta

00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:20.900

to push up with it down and we're just
going<00:03:18.780> to<00:03:18.900> be<00:03:19.020> another<00:03:19.110> half<00:03:19.530> there<00:03:19.890> another

00:03:20.270 --> 00:03:20.280 
going to be another half there another

going to be another half there another
happened<00:03:20.790> out<00:03:20.960> just<00:03:21.960> under<00:03:22.260> half<00:03:22.410> an<00:03:22.620> ounce

00:03:22.700 --> 00:03:22.710 
happened out just under half an ounce

00:03:22.710 --> 00:03:29.570 
happened out just under half an ounce
actually<00:03:25.040> in<00:03:26.040> there<00:03:26.250> and<00:03:28.340> we're<00:03:29.340> going<00:03:29.490> to

upstate
alright<00:04:42.110> the<00:04:42.740> battery<00:04:43.130> hooked<00:04:43.280> up<00:04:43.550> to<00:04:43.760> a

00:04:43.780 --> 00:04:43.790 
alright the battery hooked up to a

00:04:43.790 --> 00:04:46.630 
alright the battery hooked up to a
trickle<00:04:44.090> charger<00:04:44.630> and<00:04:45.620> what<00:04:45.740> this<00:04:45.920> does<00:04:46.160> is<00:04:46.430> it

00:04:46.630 --> 00:04:46.640 
trickle charger and what this does is it

00:04:46.640 --> 00:04:48.940 
trickle charger and what this does is it
puts<00:04:46.910> a<00:04:47.390> little<00:04:47.540> bit<00:04:47.690> of<00:04:47.810> energy<00:04:48.020> go<00:04:48.740> to<00:04:48.800> the

00:04:48.940 --> 00:04:48.950 
puts a little bit of energy go to the

00:04:48.950 --> 00:04:50.700 
puts a little bit of energy go to the
battery<00:04:49.310> over<00:04:49.550> a<00:04:49.610> long<00:04:49.790> period<00:04:50.180> of<00:04:50.210> time

00:04:50.700 --> 00:04:50.710 
battery over a long period of time

00:04:50.710 --> 00:04:52.570 
battery over a long period of time
basically<00:04:51.710> you're<00:04:51.980> going<00:04:52.100> to<00:04:52.220> leave<00:04:52.400> it<00:04:52.550> here

00:04:52.570 --> 00:04:52.580 
basically you're going to leave it here

00:04:52.580 --> 00:04:54.520 
basically you're going to leave it here
until<00:04:52.970> next<00:04:53.180> year<00:04:53.600> the<00:04:53.900> trickle<00:04:54.230> charger

00:04:54.520 --> 00:04:54.530 
until next year the trickle charger

00:04:54.530 --> 00:05:00.310 
until next year the trickle charger
we're<00:04:54.680> using<00:04:54.830> the<00:04:55.190> sea<00:04:55.550> tact<00:04:56.200> multi<00:04:57.200> u.s.<00:04:59.320> 3300

00:05:00.310 --> 00:05:00.320 
we're using the sea tact multi u.s. 3300

00:05:00.320 --> 00:05:02.800 
we're using the sea tact multi u.s. 3300
and<00:05:00.920> because<00:05:01.910> I'm<00:05:02.060> increasing<00:05:02.570> the<00:05:02.690> voltage

00:05:02.800 --> 00:05:02.810 
and because I'm increasing the voltage

00:05:02.810 --> 00:05:05.260 
and because I'm increasing the voltage
is<00:05:03.200> different<00:05:03.620> I<00:05:03.740> also<00:05:03.890> got<00:05:04.130> transformer<00:05:05.060> to

00:05:05.260 --> 00:05:05.270 
is different I also got transformer to

00:05:05.270 --> 00:05:11.410 
is different I also got transformer to
go<00:05:05.390> from<00:05:05.860> 220<00:05:06.860> to<00:05:06.950> 110<00:05:07.430> and<00:05:10.030> that's<00:05:11.030> about<00:05:11.240> it

00:05:11.410 --> 00:05:11.420 
go from 220 to 110 and that's about it

00:05:11.420 --> 00:05:13.810 
go from 220 to 110 and that's about it
for<00:05:11.600> the<00:05:11.720> battery<00:05:12.050> just<00:05:12.400> whatever<00:05:13.400> the<00:05:13.670> last

00:05:13.810 --> 00:05:13.820 
for the battery just whatever the last

00:05:13.820 --> 00:05:16.090 
for the battery just whatever the last
thing<00:05:14.030> I<00:05:14.090> did<00:05:14.300> was<00:05:14.480> put<00:05:14.750> just<00:05:15.080> plain<00:05:15.560> old<00:05:15.740> saran

00:05:16.090 --> 00:05:16.100 
thing I did was put just plain old saran

00:05:16.100 --> 00:05:18.910 
thing I did was put just plain old saran
wrap<00:05:16.310> right<00:05:16.550> here<00:05:16.730> on<00:05:16.820> the<00:05:16.910> windshield<00:05:17.470> so<00:05:18.470> the

00:05:18.910 --> 00:05:18.920 
wrap right here on the windshield so the

00:05:18.920 --> 00:05:21.010 
wrap right here on the windshield so the
windshield<00:05:19.370> wiper<00:05:19.640> blades<00:05:20.060> can<00:05:20.300> rest<00:05:20.570> on<00:05:20.840> it

00:05:21.010 --> 00:05:21.020 
windshield wiper blades can rest on it

00:05:21.020 --> 00:05:23.350 
windshield wiper blades can rest on it
so<00:05:21.440> in<00:05:21.860> case<00:05:21.890> the<00:05:22.370> rubber<00:05:22.580> comes<00:05:22.910> off<00:05:23.090> of<00:05:23.240> those

00:05:23.350 --> 00:05:23.360 
so in case the rubber comes off of those

00:05:23.360 --> 00:05:25.210
