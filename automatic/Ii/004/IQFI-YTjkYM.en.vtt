00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.940
 hello people today there is again 

00:00:02.730 --> 00:00:07.710
 hall and that lifestyle, I would 

00:00:05.940 --> 00:00:09.960
 so land things for the apartment so 

00:00:07.710 --> 00:00:11.670
 a technique gadget and a book not 

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:13.080
 many things but a few quite 

00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:14.820
 I find nice things with you 

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:17.310
 wanted to share and we'll start right away 

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:19.590
 with one of my favorite products and 

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:21.270
 Although the butler are so household 

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:24.330
 things and I am actually like that 

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:26.640
 clip document as sometimes already when it 

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:28.050
 cheesy is especially like but you 

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:30.090
 i thought i was so cool i always wanted to 

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:31.470
 so have a little old vw-bus and 

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:33.840
 It's made of metal which I really love 

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:35.850
 find it at what sale just for 

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:37.500
 5 euro instead of 10 euro also in 

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:40.079
 other colors and then one 

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:43.170
 mature on it and surfboard and the stands 

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:47.010
 for me simple model in concept of 

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:49.230
 Freedom and thus stop moderate I would 

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:50.760
 really like sometime friends so 

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:52.590
 have such a bus and with friends through 

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:55.260
 pulling the world and just music 

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:57.059
 Listen to have fun and from festival too 

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:58.260
 festival or soja that I associate 

00:00:57.059 --> 00:01:00.780
 At that time , I think that's right 

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:02.520
 well and maybe that's the way you are 

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:04.739
 you write the comments if you too 

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:06.840
 Such a fan side of the old VW buses 

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:09.510
 and dreams of that idealized and 

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:10.590
 imagine how cool that would be me 

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:12.420
 I'm a bit crazy 

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:13.860
 then I though so goes exactly by 

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:15.780
 Butlers I like to do so 

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:18.119
 different dishes things to 

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:21.119
 and broke down in paris 

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:23.340
 which is why a few new one well once 

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:25.200
 these and one more that's it 

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:27.720
 is pink I would say big 

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:29.700
 pink pietsch can be color blind at the film set 

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:31.650
 and there are such ornaments on it you can see 

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:34.079
 So keep it out moderately and the cage costs 

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:37.320
 not at all as I think 34 euros 

00:01:34.079 --> 00:01:40.860
 or so was three euros due pretty pretty 

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:44.729
 and often worn wear then 

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:46.170
 two cellar world to say and that 

00:01:44.729 --> 00:01:48.060
 I also have some of Butler's 

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:49.020
 this music seems to be taken last 

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:50.880
 Maybe you remember that 

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:53.280
 are mine or the others the 

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:55.439
 Advertisements are reduced by half 

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:56.159
 grad I believe from five euros to 52 

00:01:55.439 --> 00:01:58.170
 or something like that 

00:01:56.159 --> 00:01:59.759
 and that's just really cute with this one 

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:01.920
 rand and a bit old-fashioned 

00:01:59.759 --> 00:02:04.649
 but again modern and which me 

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:08.220
 also very nice this is dark 

00:02:04.649 --> 00:02:09.959
 purple and it looks very nice if 

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:12.270
 you touched on it but that's alright 

00:02:09.959 --> 00:02:13.100
 nothing else has so beautiful another side 

00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:15.530
 again such a moment 

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:19.490
 so swinging and I like that very much 

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:24.490
 nice of the costs a few euros too 

00:02:19.490 --> 00:02:27.470
 a book and indeed the book luck of 

00:02:24.490 --> 00:02:29.720
 dumont verlag means the world book 

00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:32.480
 of happiness there is a world formula for 

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:34.040
 luck this time before what are on it 

00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:36.230
 standing white that explains everything very well 

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:38.600
 the knowledge of 100 lux researchers 

00:02:36.230 --> 00:02:39.860
 All over the world that means 100 lucky researchers 

00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:41.870
 so somehow with the topic 

00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:44.510
 to deal with one tries in one 

00:02:41.870 --> 00:02:47.270
 certain number of 150 or 200 words in short 

00:02:44.510 --> 00:02:49.700
 to grasp how they define happiness what 

00:02:47.270 --> 00:02:54.710
 your yes your results of your work 

00:02:49.700 --> 00:02:57.140
 it is almost time is the money is 

00:02:54.710 --> 00:02:58.820
 there is such a thing as health 

00:02:57.140 --> 00:03:01.700
 generally valid rules for 

00:02:58.820 --> 00:03:03.560
 to be happy an international 

00:03:01.700 --> 00:03:05.600
 Author's director opens untold 

00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:07.810
 denkrÃ¤ume and new paths to the triggers 

00:03:05.600 --> 00:03:09.800
 of happiness, success, human closeness 

00:03:07.810 --> 00:03:12.350
 genetics and humor 

00:03:09.800 --> 00:03:14.240
 what have the chances of life and of 

00:03:12.350 --> 00:03:15.950
 free will but also pain and 

00:03:14.240 --> 00:03:18.290
 sadness to do with happiness 

00:03:15.950 --> 00:03:20.080
 this book leads the reader on the track 

00:03:18.290 --> 00:03:21.320
 without philosophical and spiritual 

00:03:20.080 --> 00:03:24.410
 speculation 

00:03:21.320 --> 00:03:26.390
 yes and that describes the mood 

00:03:24.410 --> 00:03:28.610
 Well, it costs 14 euros here and it is 

00:03:26.390 --> 00:03:31.850
 speak incredibly nicely finished 

00:03:28.610 --> 00:03:33.650
 thus illustrates photos in between and 

00:03:31.850 --> 00:03:35.210
 big headlines and then still 

00:03:33.650 --> 00:03:38.330
 divided something again in color 

00:03:35.210 --> 00:03:41.030
 deposited and one pushed so that one 

00:03:38.330 --> 00:03:42.920
 that can read very well and thereby 

00:03:41.030 --> 00:03:45.320
 that there are always such short statements 

00:03:42.920 --> 00:03:47.360
 as short thoughts are of certain 

00:03:45.320 --> 00:03:48.980
 I find that it is very nice 

00:03:47.360 --> 00:03:51.680
 if you do not have time around 

00:03:48.980 --> 00:03:53.540
 an entire book to read once just 

00:03:51.680 --> 00:03:56.510
 jagged but you can always every day 

00:03:53.540 --> 00:03:58.760
 so read three pages or two 

00:03:56.510 --> 00:04:00.650
 from a person as she defines happiness 

00:03:58.760 --> 00:04:03.410
 and there are simply food for thought and 

00:04:00.650 --> 00:04:06.950
 little nice book for me then 

00:04:03.410 --> 00:04:08.750
 a technique gadget and that for him 

00:04:06.950 --> 00:04:10.970
 I have such a small laptop 

00:04:08.750 --> 00:04:12.320
 Case bought the hot gekko something 

00:04:10.970 --> 00:04:14.060
 they also have a lot more 

00:04:12.320 --> 00:04:18.080
 different colors not transparent 

00:04:14.060 --> 00:04:19.580
 and so on because this little one is 

00:04:18.080 --> 00:04:21.150
 little laptop him here 

00:04:19.580 --> 00:04:23.250
 that does not have one 

00:04:21.150 --> 00:04:24.960
 the metal case like the big macbook 

00:04:23.250 --> 00:04:27.449
 Pros So I've already got that 

00:04:24.960 --> 00:04:28.800
 one and a half or two years for the 

00:04:27.449 --> 00:04:30.479
 work when I'm on the way 

00:04:28.800 --> 00:04:32.759
 works because it is so easy 

00:04:30.479 --> 00:04:34.110
 and very handy and it already has 

00:04:32.759 --> 00:04:36.060
 suffered a bit and has one 

00:04:34.110 --> 00:04:37.620
 or other scratches dings and now 

00:04:36.060 --> 00:04:39.810
 I have this housing brought me there 

00:04:37.620 --> 00:04:41.520
 Just stick it up and have it down 

00:04:39.810 --> 00:04:44.580
 still for the ventilation stops here so holes 

00:04:41.520 --> 00:04:46.440
 and feet I find that very practical 

00:04:44.580 --> 00:04:47.970
 Amazon I think I have 18 

00:04:46.440 --> 00:04:49.470
 paid in euros or so there is a lot of coal 

00:04:47.970 --> 00:04:52.039
 colors and I find the color too mega 

00:04:49.470 --> 00:04:55.110
 cool and I am very satisfied so far 

00:04:52.039 --> 00:04:57.330
 then the last part is a tealight 

00:04:55.110 --> 00:04:58.979
 many whole also butlers namely 

00:04:57.330 --> 00:05:01.139
 are there funnily pretty much the 

00:04:58.979 --> 00:05:03.539
 same moments as on the glasses on it 

00:05:01.139 --> 00:05:05.580
 and yes that is so silver and speckled 

00:05:03.539 --> 00:05:07.800
 and are incredibly pretty out of cost 23 

00:05:05.580 --> 00:05:09.570
 euro and looks so beautiful when 

00:05:07.800 --> 00:05:12.020
 then tealight in it is dark and 

00:05:09.570 --> 00:05:15.289
 through these small holes, the light is so 

00:05:12.020 --> 00:05:18.240
 shines out and so a beautiful 

00:05:15.289 --> 00:05:19.440
 light cone around this tealight forms and 

00:05:18.240 --> 00:05:20.990
 That's why I think that's pretty 

00:05:19.440 --> 00:05:23.370
 clean the recommend if you as well as 

00:05:20.990 --> 00:05:26.669
 lamp light at light and so peaceful 

00:05:23.370 --> 00:05:29.280
 like me and that was nice too 

00:05:26.669 --> 00:05:30.240
 Short and sweet, I would say next 

00:05:29.280 --> 00:05:31.949
 week comes with something again 

00:05:30.240 --> 00:05:32.970
 eat and so and I hope you have it 

00:05:31.949 --> 00:05:36.530

00:05:32.970 --> 00:05:36.530
