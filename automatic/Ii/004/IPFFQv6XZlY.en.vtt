harsher this particular
b-series<00:02:18.520> has<00:02:18.760> got<00:02:18.970> about<00:02:19.180> a<00:02:19.660> hundred<00:02:20.470> hours

b-series has got about a hundred hours
on<00:02:21.069> this<00:02:21.220> oil<00:02:21.370> so<00:02:21.640> it's<00:02:21.790> a<00:02:21.850> little<00:02:22.030> bit<00:02:22.209> overdue

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:22.690 
on this oil so it's a little bit overdue

00:02:22.690 --> 00:02:24.330 
on this oil so it's a little bit overdue
and<00:02:22.990> if<00:02:23.319> you<00:02:23.410> get<00:02:23.560> a<00:02:23.590> good<00:02:23.770> look<00:02:24.010> at<00:02:24.160> that

00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:24.340 
and if you get a good look at that

00:02:24.340 --> 00:02:26.550 
and if you get a good look at that
you'll<00:02:24.550> get<00:02:24.700> an<00:02:24.819> idea<00:02:25.270> of<00:02:25.390> how<00:02:25.569> dirty<00:02:25.930> that<00:02:26.200> oil

00:02:26.550 --> 00:02:26.560 
you'll get an idea of how dirty that oil

00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:28.949 
you'll get an idea of how dirty that oil
is<00:02:26.770> now<00:02:27.400> don't<00:02:27.790> let<00:02:27.970> that<00:02:28.120> worry<00:02:28.420> you<00:02:28.540> because

00:02:28.949 --> 00:02:28.959 
is now don't let that worry you because

00:02:28.959 --> 00:02:30.570 
is now don't let that worry you because
Diesel's<00:02:29.440> typically<00:02:29.920> are<00:02:30.130> a<00:02:30.160> little<00:02:30.459> bit

00:02:30.570 --> 00:02:30.580 
Diesel's typically are a little bit

00:02:30.580 --> 00:02:32.940 
Diesel's typically are a little bit
dirty<00:02:30.820> and<00:02:31.060> the<00:02:31.150> oil<00:02:31.300> side<00:02:31.660> anyway<00:02:32.080> so<00:02:32.140> it's<00:02:32.800> a

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:32.950 
dirty and the oil side anyway so it's a

00:02:32.950 --> 00:02:34.980 
dirty and the oil side anyway so it's a
good<00:02:32.980> time<00:02:33.190> to<00:02:33.400> change<00:02:33.730> that<00:02:33.880> oil<00:02:34.060> now<00:02:34.300> so

00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:34.990 
good time to change that oil now so

00:02:34.990 --> 00:02:37.020 
good time to change that oil now so
while<00:02:35.500> the<00:02:35.650> oil<00:02:35.680> is<00:02:35.950> draining<00:02:36.190> from<00:02:36.430> the<00:02:36.640> the

00:03:46.170 --> 00:03:46.180 
little bit further so that when we spin

00:04:05.069 --> 00:04:05.079 
chuck it in the garbage can that you

00:04:05.079 --> 00:04:06.660 
chuck it in the garbage can that you
actually<00:04:05.350> drain<00:04:05.590> the<00:04:05.769> residual<00:04:06.280> oil<00:04:06.370> out<00:04:06.640> of

here or right here and the reason you do

00:04:26.560 --> 00:04:27.750 
here or right here and the reason you do
that's<00:04:26.740> pretty<00:04:26.980> simple<00:04:27.250> you<00:04:27.460> want<00:04:27.610> to<00:04:27.670> keep

00:04:27.750 --> 00:04:27.760 
that's pretty simple you want to keep

00:04:27.760 --> 00:04:29.190 
that's pretty simple you want to keep
some<00:04:27.970> lubrication<00:04:28.390> on<00:04:28.600> there<00:04:28.780> so<00:04:28.960> that<00:04:28.990> when

00:04:29.190 --> 00:04:29.200 
some lubrication on there so that when

00:04:29.200 --> 00:04:31.320 
some lubrication on there so that when
you<00:04:29.350> install<00:04:30.130> it<00:04:30.310> on<00:04:30.550> to<00:04:30.700> the<00:04:30.790> engine<00:04:30.940> itself

00:04:31.320 --> 00:04:31.330 
you install it on to the engine itself

00:04:31.330 --> 00:04:33.780 
you install it on to the engine itself
and<00:04:32.140> as<00:04:32.260> the<00:04:32.620> tractor<00:04:32.860> operates<00:04:33.400> at<00:04:33.490> operating

00:04:33.780 --> 00:04:33.790 
and as the tractor operates at operating

00:04:33.790 --> 00:04:35.580 
and as the tractor operates at operating
temperature<00:04:33.880> it<00:04:34.300> doesn't<00:04:34.570> burn<00:04:34.810> itself<00:04:35.170> on<00:04:35.410> to

00:04:35.580 --> 00:04:35.590 
temperature it doesn't burn itself on to

00:04:35.590 --> 00:04:36.810 
temperature it doesn't burn itself on to
the<00:04:35.680> engine<00:04:35.920> block<00:04:36.010> and<00:04:36.130> actually<00:04:36.580> become

00:04:36.810 --> 00:04:36.820 
the engine block and actually become

00:04:36.820 --> 00:04:38.070 
the engine block and actually become
stuck<00:04:37.180> and<00:04:37.360> that's<00:04:37.420> that's<00:04:37.690> been<00:04:37.840> a<00:04:37.900> real

00:04:38.070 --> 00:04:38.080 
stuck and that's that's been a real

00:04:38.080 --> 00:04:38.400 
stuck and that's that's been a real
issue

00:04:38.400 --> 00:04:38.410 
issue

00:04:38.410 --> 00:04:41.520 
issue
so<00:04:39.220> before<00:04:39.460> you<00:04:39.550> put<00:04:39.700> it<00:04:39.790> on<00:04:40.230> make<00:04:41.230> sure<00:04:41.380> that

00:04:41.520 --> 00:04:41.530 
so before you put it on make sure that

00:04:41.530 --> 00:04:45.260 
so before you put it on make sure that
the<00:04:41.650> oil<00:04:41.680> filter<00:04:42.610> mounting<00:04:43.180> boss<00:04:43.420> is<00:04:44.100> clean

00:04:45.260 --> 00:04:45.270 
the oil filter mounting boss is clean

00:04:52.890 --> 00:04:52.900 
and I'm just going to dip my finger in

00:04:52.900 --> 00:04:56.090 
and I'm just going to dip my finger in
the<00:04:53.110> old<00:04:53.320> oil<00:04:54.090> just<00:04:55.090> get<00:04:55.270> a<00:04:55.300> little<00:04:55.480> bit<00:04:55.600> oil

00:04:56.090 --> 00:04:56.100 
the old oil just get a little bit oil

00:04:56.100 --> 00:04:59.190 
the old oil just get a little bit oil
and<00:04:57.100> just<00:04:57.250> lubricate<00:04:57.760> that<00:04:58.000> a<00:04:58.240> little<00:04:59.050> bit

00:04:59.190 --> 00:04:59.200 
and just lubricate that a little bit

00:04:59.200 --> 00:05:01.560 
and just lubricate that a little bit
just<00:04:59.410> so<00:04:59.550> it's<00:05:00.550> got<00:05:00.790> a<00:05:00.820> little<00:05:01.060> tiny<00:05:01.210> bit<00:05:01.450> of

00:05:01.560 --> 00:05:01.570 
just so it's got a little tiny bit of

00:05:01.570 --> 00:05:04.110 
just so it's got a little tiny bit of
oil<00:05:01.840> on<00:05:02.530> there<00:05:02.740> and<00:05:02.950> then<00:05:03.490> spin<00:05:03.790> the<00:05:03.910> oil

00:05:04.110 --> 00:05:04.120 
oil on there and then spin the oil

00:05:04.120 --> 00:05:09.000 
oil on there and then spin the oil
filter<00:05:04.420> on<00:05:07.050> now<00:05:08.050> we're<00:05:08.200> doing<00:05:08.290> this<00:05:08.470> in<00:05:08.620> actual

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:09.010 
filter on now we're doing this in actual

00:05:09.010 --> 00:05:11.100 
filter on now we're doing this in actual
time<00:05:09.220> so<00:05:09.520> I<00:05:09.760> think<00:05:09.880> if<00:05:10.120> you're<00:05:10.240> following

00:05:11.100 --> 00:05:11.110 
time so I think if you're following

00:05:11.110 --> 00:05:12.810 
time so I think if you're following
along<00:05:11.170> you<00:05:11.530> can<00:05:11.650> see<00:05:11.830> that<00:05:12.010> it<00:05:12.100> it<00:05:12.640> doesn't

00:05:12.810 --> 00:05:12.820 
along you can see that it it doesn't

00:05:12.820 --> 00:05:14.340 
along you can see that it it doesn't
take<00:05:13.030> a<00:05:13.060> lot<00:05:13.300> of<00:05:13.450> time<00:05:13.630> to<00:05:13.780> really<00:05:14.020> change<00:05:14.200> the

00:05:14.340 --> 00:05:14.350 
take a lot of time to really change the

00:05:14.350 --> 00:05:15.890 
take a lot of time to really change the
oil<00:05:14.470> on<00:05:14.770> your<00:05:14.920> tractor

00:05:15.890 --> 00:05:15.900 
oil on your tractor

00:05:15.900 --> 00:05:19.200 
oil on your tractor
so<00:05:16.900> with<00:05:17.050> that<00:05:17.169> filter<00:05:17.530> in<00:05:17.650> place<00:05:17.850> good<00:05:18.850> idea

00:05:19.200 --> 00:05:19.210 
so with that filter in place good idea

00:05:19.210 --> 00:05:21.480 
so with that filter in place good idea

00:05:52.290 --> 00:05:52.300 
over so we've got our new filter in

00:05:52.300 --> 00:05:55.140 
over so we've got our new filter in
place<00:05:52.440> our<00:05:53.440> oil<00:05:53.680> has<00:05:53.800> now<00:05:53.890> stopped<00:05:54.760> draining

from<00:05:55.240> the<00:05:55.390> oil<00:05:55.510> pan<00:05:55.810> so<00:05:56.530> we'll<00:05:56.800> just<00:05:57.190> take<00:05:57.310> a

00:05:57.360 --> 00:05:57.370 
from the oil pan so we'll just take a

00:05:57.370 --> 00:05:59.690 
from the oil pan so we'll just take a
quick<00:05:57.430> inspection<00:05:57.880> of<00:05:58.270> the<00:05:58.360> oil<00:05:58.510> plug<00:05:58.780> itself

00:05:59.690 --> 00:05:59.700 
quick inspection of the oil plug itself

00:05:59.700 --> 00:06:03.920 
quick inspection of the oil plug itself
maybe<00:06:00.700> we'll<00:06:00.850> plug<00:06:01.140> clean<00:06:02.140> it<00:06:02.260> up<00:06:02.350> a<00:06:02.440> little

00:06:03.920 --> 00:06:03.930 
maybe we'll plug clean it up a little

00:06:03.930 --> 00:06:07.110 
maybe we'll plug clean it up a little
there's<00:06:04.930> a<00:06:05.020> gasket<00:06:05.290> at<00:06:05.590> the<00:06:05.680> bottom<00:06:06.010> make<00:06:06.970> sure

00:06:07.110 --> 00:06:07.120 
there's a gasket at the bottom make sure

00:06:07.120 --> 00:06:18.920 
there's a gasket at the bottom make sure
it's<00:06:07.270> clean<00:06:07.570> and<00:06:07.810> back<00:06:08.680> in<00:06:08.890> place<00:06:09.100> it<00:06:09.280> goes

00:06:18.930 --> 00:06:24.360 

and<00:06:19.930> like<00:06:20.710> that<00:06:22.620> I'll<00:06:23.620> just<00:06:23.770> get<00:06:23.980> my<00:06:24.100> wrench

00:06:24.360 --> 00:06:24.370 
and like that I'll just get my wrench

00:06:24.370 --> 00:06:27.060 
and like that I'll just get my wrench
and<00:06:24.580> give<00:06:24.700> that<00:06:24.880> a<00:06:24.910> bit<00:06:25.120> of<00:06:25.150> a<00:06:25.270> snug<00:06:25.800> again<00:06:26.800> most

and give that a bit of a snug again most
of<00:06:27.190> the<00:06:27.280> b-series<00:06:27.670> take<00:06:28.000> a<00:06:28.030> 19<00:06:28.540> millimeter

00:06:29.510 --> 00:06:29.520 
of the b-series take a 19 millimeter

00:06:29.520 --> 00:06:31.100 
of the b-series take a 19 millimeter
that's<00:06:30.520> it

00:06:31.100 --> 00:06:31.110 
that's it

00:06:31.110 --> 00:06:33.510

now<00:06:32.110> you<00:06:32.170> notice<00:06:32.500> that<00:06:32.530> I<00:06:32.710> snug<00:06:33.070> that<00:06:33.100> up<00:06:33.280> just

00:06:33.510 --> 00:06:33.520 
now you notice that I snug that up just

00:06:33.520 --> 00:06:35.880 
now you notice that I snug that up just
a<00:06:33.730> bit<00:06:33.970> of<00:06:34.060> a<00:06:34.120> quarter<00:06:34.450> of<00:06:34.540> a<00:06:34.600> turn<00:06:34.840> and<00:06:35.170> also<00:06:35.770> on

a bit of a quarter of a turn and also on
the<00:06:36.010> oil<00:06:36.160> filter<00:06:36.430> I<00:06:36.610> just<00:06:36.850> made<00:06:37.000> sure<00:06:37.030> it<00:06:37.180> was

00:06:37.380 --> 00:06:37.390 
the oil filter I just made sure it was

00:06:37.390 --> 00:06:40.170 
the oil filter I just made sure it was
on<00:06:37.510> hand<00:06:37.810> tight<00:06:38.100> so<00:06:39.100> we<00:06:39.460> drop<00:06:39.700> the<00:06:39.850> old<00:06:39.970> oil

00:06:40.170 --> 00:06:40.180 
on hand tight so we drop the old oil

00:06:40.180 --> 00:06:42.870

00:06:50.850 --> 00:06:50.860 
here at the top is where our oil fill is

00:06:50.860 --> 00:06:53.460 
here at the top is where our oil fill is
going<00:06:51.040> to<00:06:51.100> go<00:06:51.190> in<00:06:51.900> I'll<00:06:52.900> clean<00:06:53.170> that<00:06:53.320> off<00:06:53.440> a

little bit set it aside puddle in there

00:06:57.250 --> 00:07:04.020 
little bit set it aside puddle in there
and<00:06:57.400> let<00:06:57.730> me<00:06:57.820> grab<00:06:58.030> our<00:06:58.210> oil<00:07:00.330> and<00:07:01.330> now<00:07:02.820> as<00:07:03.820> easy

00:07:08.790 --> 00:07:08.800 
oil in now there's a lot of debate on

00:07:08.800 --> 00:07:11.010 
oil in now there's a lot of debate on
viscosity<00:07:09.790> of<00:07:09.880> oils<00:07:10.180> and<00:07:10.450> operating

00:07:11.010 --> 00:07:11.020 
viscosity of oils and operating

00:07:11.020 --> 00:07:12.660 
viscosity of oils and operating
temperatures<00:07:11.650> and<00:07:11.890> ambient<00:07:12.250> temperatures

00:07:12.660 --> 00:07:12.670 
temperatures and ambient temperatures

00:07:12.670 --> 00:07:15.390 
temperatures and ambient temperatures
again<00:07:12.970> Kubota<00:07:13.480> has<00:07:14.040> recommendations<00:07:15.040> perhaps

00:07:15.390 --> 00:07:15.400 
again Kubota has recommendations perhaps

00:07:15.400 --> 00:07:18.420 
again Kubota has recommendations perhaps
that<00:07:15.610> are<00:07:15.700> 10w30<00:07:16.180> but<00:07:16.690> again<00:07:16.930> we're<00:07:17.110> on<00:07:17.140> 15<00:07:17.710> 15

00:07:18.420 --> 00:07:18.430 
that are 10w30 but again we're on 15 15

00:07:18.430 --> 00:07:20.580 
that are 10w30 but again we're on 15 15

40 whatever you do for your particular

00:07:20.590 --> 00:07:22.080 
40 whatever you do for your particular
tractor<00:07:21.070> just<00:07:21.100> make<00:07:21.400> sure<00:07:21.550> that<00:07:21.730> it<00:07:21.850> meets<00:07:21.970> a

00:07:22.080 --> 00:07:22.090 
tractor just make sure that it meets a

00:07:22.090 --> 00:07:24.950 
tractor just make sure that it meets a
recommendation<00:07:22.390> as<00:07:22.870> it's<00:07:23.380> going<00:07:23.590> to<00:07:23.650> be<00:07:23.770> right

00:07:24.950 --> 00:07:24.960 
recommendation as it's going to be right

00:07:24.960 --> 00:07:28.350 
recommendation as it's going to be right
so<00:07:25.960> as<00:07:26.110> you<00:07:26.230> put<00:07:26.410> the<00:07:26.500> oil<00:07:26.650> in<00:07:27.060> we'll<00:07:28.060> add<00:07:28.210> it

00:07:28.350 --> 00:07:28.360 
so as you put the oil in we'll add it

00:07:28.360 --> 00:07:30.090 
so as you put the oil in we'll add it
all<00:07:28.510> and<00:07:28.900> then<00:07:29.260> pull<00:07:29.440> the<00:07:29.530> dipstick<00:07:29.680> and<00:07:29.890> make

00:07:30.090 --> 00:07:30.100 
all and then pull the dipstick and make

00:07:30.100 --> 00:07:33.000 
all and then pull the dipstick and make
sure<00:07:30.220> that<00:07:30.340> we're<00:07:30.490> up<00:07:30.580> to<00:07:30.700> level<00:07:31.830> all<00:07:32.830> right

00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:33.010 
sure that we're up to level all right

00:07:33.010 --> 00:07:34.590 
sure that we're up to level all right
well<00:07:33.130> I<00:07:33.160> think<00:07:33.310> we've<00:07:33.400> got<00:07:33.550> as<00:07:33.670> much<00:07:33.880> oil<00:07:34.300> in

00:07:34.590 --> 00:07:34.600 
well I think we've got as much oil in

00:07:34.600 --> 00:07:36.150 
well I think we've got as much oil in
there<00:07:34.780> is<00:07:34.900> this<00:07:34.990> particular<00:07:35.530> model<00:07:35.830> is<00:07:36.010> going

00:07:36.150 --> 00:07:36.160 
there is this particular model is going

00:07:36.160 --> 00:07:38.970 
there is this particular model is going
to<00:07:36.220> take<00:07:36.900> so<00:07:37.900> what's<00:07:38.140> left<00:07:38.350> to<00:07:38.440> do<00:07:38.560> is<00:07:38.710> to<00:07:38.800> pull

00:07:38.970 --> 00:07:38.980 
to take so what's left to do is to pull

00:07:38.980 --> 00:07:40.470 
to take so what's left to do is to pull
the<00:07:39.070> dipstick<00:07:39.220> and<00:07:39.640> make<00:07:39.970> sure<00:07:40.120> that<00:07:40.270> we're<00:07:40.390> up

00:07:40.470 --> 00:07:40.480 
the dipstick and make sure that we're up

00:07:40.480 --> 00:07:41.940 
the dipstick and make sure that we're up
to<00:07:40.570> the<00:07:40.660> hash<00:07:40.870> marks<00:07:41.230> that's<00:07:41.380> indicated<00:07:41.860> on

00:07:45.390 --> 00:07:48.840 

dipstick<00:07:46.390> on<00:07:46.600> this<00:07:46.810> tractor<00:07:47.410> is<00:07:47.670> pretty<00:07:48.670> easy

00:07:48.840 --> 00:07:48.850 
dipstick on this tractor is pretty easy

00:07:48.850 --> 00:07:50.900 
dipstick on this tractor is pretty easy
to<00:07:48.910> find<00:07:49.150> on<00:07:49.360> the<00:07:49.420> side<00:07:49.600> of<00:07:49.690> the<00:07:49.750> engine<00:07:49.900> block

00:07:50.900 --> 00:07:50.910 
to find on the side of the engine block

00:07:50.910 --> 00:07:53.660 
to find on the side of the engine block
bringing<00:07:51.910> it<00:07:52.060> out<00:07:52.180> we<00:07:52.870> just<00:07:53.050> wipe<00:07:53.200> that<00:07:53.350> off

00:07:53.660 --> 00:07:53.670 
bringing it out we just wipe that off

00:07:53.670 --> 00:07:56.760 
bringing it out we just wipe that off
and<00:07:54.670> dip<00:07:54.940> it<00:07:55.060> one<00:07:55.180> more<00:07:55.360> time<00:07:55.650> it's<00:07:56.650> not

00:07:56.760 --> 00:07:56.770 
and dip it one more time it's not

00:07:56.770 --> 00:07:58.080 
and dip it one more time it's not
uncommon<00:07:57.130> to<00:07:57.340> find<00:07:57.580> that<00:07:57.790> you'll<00:07:57.910> have<00:07:58.030> a

00:07:58.080 --> 00:07:58.090 
uncommon to find that you'll have a

00:07:58.090 --> 00:07:59.880 
uncommon to find that you'll have a

inside<00:08:00.250> but<00:08:00.550> not<00:08:00.940> to<00:08:01.120> worry<00:08:01.240> about<00:08:01.660> it<00:08:01.890> that<00:08:02.890> is

00:08:03.120 --> 00:08:03.130 
inside but not to worry about it that is

00:08:03.130 --> 00:08:05.220 
inside but not to worry about it that is
fresh<00:08:03.400> oil<00:08:03.730> is<00:08:04.060> up<00:08:04.300> to<00:08:04.450> snuff<00:08:04.690> and<00:08:04.990> these

00:08:05.220 --> 00:08:05.230 
fresh oil is up to snuff and these

00:08:05.230 --> 00:08:07.350 
fresh oil is up to snuff and these
