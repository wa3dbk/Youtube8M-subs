00:04:20.770 --> 00:04:20.780 
pack right when it comes out you get a

00:04:20.780 --> 00:04:23.290 
pack right when it comes out you get a
bunch<00:04:21.020> it<00:04:21.260> goes<00:04:21.440> people<00:04:21.770> I<00:04:22.010> have<00:04:22.160> no<00:04:22.520> idea<00:04:22.970> why

00:04:23.290 --> 00:04:23.300 
bunch it goes people I have no idea why

00:04:23.300 --> 00:04:26.710 
bunch it goes people I have no idea why
I<00:04:23.600> play<00:04:23.840> my<00:04:24.530> first<00:04:24.770> first<00:04:25.490> week<00:04:25.700> actually<00:04:26.360> I<00:04:26.540> do

00:04:26.710 --> 00:04:26.720 
I play my first first week actually I do

00:04:26.720 --> 00:04:28.720 
I play my first first week actually I do
have<00:04:26.870> an<00:04:27.110> idea<00:04:27.230> well<00:04:27.620> because<00:04:27.890> they<00:04:28.040> they

00:04:28.720 --> 00:04:28.730 
have an idea well because they they

00:04:28.730 --> 00:04:32.740 
have an idea well because they they
don't<00:04:28.940> know<00:04:29.710> where<00:04:30.710> they<00:04:30.980> are<00:04:31.010> and<00:04:31.540> they<00:04:32.540> don't

00:04:32.740 --> 00:04:32.750 
don't know where they are and they don't

00:04:32.750 --> 00:04:34.570 
don't know where they are and they don't
want<00:04:32.900> you<00:04:33.140> to<00:04:33.350> know<00:04:33.500> where<00:04:33.920> they<00:04:34.040> are<00:04:34.190> either

00:04:34.570 --> 00:04:34.580 
want you to know where they are either

00:04:34.580 --> 00:04:37.450 
want you to know where they are either
so<00:04:35.360> it<00:04:35.540> gives<00:04:35.720> them<00:04:35.870> better<00:04:36.110> chances<00:04:36.500> to

00:04:37.450 --> 00:04:37.460 
so it gives them better chances to

00:04:37.460 --> 00:04:41.770 
so it gives them better chances to
stay<00:04:38.000> alive<00:04:40.340> yeah<00:04:40.520> too<00:04:40.970> bad<00:04:41.210> once<00:04:41.690> the

00:04:41.770 --> 00:04:41.780 
stay alive yeah too bad once the

00:04:41.780 --> 00:04:43.180 
stay alive yeah too bad once the
blackbird<00:04:42.139> goes<00:04:42.290> up<00:04:42.470> you're<00:04:42.650> pretty<00:04:42.949> much

00:04:43.180 --> 00:04:43.190 
blackbird goes up you're pretty much

00:04:43.190 --> 00:04:43.840 
blackbird goes up you're pretty much

00:04:43.850 --> 00:04:46.870 
screwed
so<00:04:44.750> yeah<00:04:44.900> this<00:04:45.199> map<00:04:45.410> looks<00:04:45.680> pretty<00:04:46.009> promising

00:04:46.870 --> 00:04:46.880 
so yeah this map looks pretty promising

00:04:46.880 --> 00:04:49.480 
so yeah this map looks pretty promising
from<00:04:47.720> a<00:04:47.840> competitive<00:04:48.169> standpoint<00:04:48.710> I<00:04:49.280> don't

00:04:49.480 --> 00:04:49.490 
from a competitive standpoint I don't

00:04:49.490 --> 00:04:51.719 
from a competitive standpoint I don't
know<00:04:49.759> if<00:04:49.880> we'll<00:04:50.030> be<00:04:50.060> like<00:04:50.990> in<00:04:51.020> an<00:04:51.320> MLG

00:04:51.719 --> 00:04:51.729 
know if we'll be like in an MLG

00:04:51.729 --> 00:04:54.400 
know if we'll be like in an MLG
playlists<00:04:52.729> or<00:04:52.820> anything<00:04:53.030> like<00:04:53.300> that<00:04:53.330> but<00:04:54.110> it's

00:04:54.400 --> 00:04:54.410 
playlists or anything like that but it's

00:04:54.410 --> 00:04:57.460 
playlists or anything like that but it's
it's<00:04:54.710> a<00:04:54.860> pretty<00:04:55.039> fun<00:04:55.310> map<00:04:55.550> so<00:04:56.509> far<00:04:56.840> from<00:04:57.259> what

00:04:57.460 --> 00:04:57.470 
it's a pretty fun map so far from what

00:04:57.470 --> 00:04:59.170 
it's a pretty fun map so far from what
I've<00:04:57.650> played<00:04:57.680> and<00:04:58.550> you<00:04:58.699> know<00:04:58.820> this<00:04:58.970> map

00:04:59.170 --> 00:04:59.180 
I've played and you know this map

00:04:59.180 --> 00:05:02.890 
I've played and you know this map
reminds<00:04:59.630> me<00:04:59.780> a<00:04:59.930> lot<00:05:00.139> of<00:05:00.440> Carnival<00:05:01.900> just

00:05:02.890 --> 00:05:02.900 
reminds me a lot of Carnival just

00:05:02.900 --> 00:05:05.560 
reminds me a lot of Carnival just
because<00:05:03.169> maybe<00:05:03.530> it's<00:05:03.770> it's<00:05:04.190> those<00:05:04.370> rails<00:05:05.060> that

00:05:05.560 --> 00:05:05.570 
because maybe it's it's those rails that

00:05:05.570 --> 00:05:08.409 
because maybe it's it's those rails that
you<00:05:05.930> can<00:05:06.110> see<00:05:06.259> up<00:05:06.560> top<00:05:07.180> maybe<00:05:08.180> it's<00:05:08.330> those

00:05:08.409 --> 00:05:08.419 
you can see up top maybe it's those

00:05:08.419 --> 00:05:13.379 
you can see up top maybe it's those
brick<00:05:09.340> yeah<00:05:10.340> the<00:05:10.520> walls<00:05:10.910> have<00:05:11.090> made<00:05:11.510> of<00:05:11.660> brick

00:05:13.379 --> 00:05:13.389 
brick yeah the walls have made of brick

00:05:13.389 --> 00:05:17.110 
brick yeah the walls have made of brick
but<00:05:14.389> overall<00:05:14.810> it<00:05:15.110> is<00:05:15.530> a<00:05:16.280> good<00:05:16.460> map<00:05:16.669> to<00:05:16.910> play

00:05:17.110 --> 00:05:17.120 
but overall it is a good map to play

00:05:17.120 --> 00:05:21.159
