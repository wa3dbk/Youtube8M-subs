we've got the heater on alright and that
will<00:02:17.890> lady<00:02:18.280> on<00:02:18.400> the<00:02:18.489> raffle

00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:33.090 

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:35.730 

okay<00:02:34.090> now<00:02:34.300> to<00:02:34.360> end<00:02:34.630> it<00:02:34.900> you're<00:02:35.500> going<00:02:35.620> to<00:02:35.680> take

00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:35.740 
okay now to end it you're going to take

00:02:35.740 --> 00:02:37.920 
okay now to end it you're going to take
that<00:02:36.100> loop<00:02:36.340> that<00:02:36.550> we<00:02:36.760> made<00:02:36.970> which<00:02:37.600> is<00:02:37.720> right

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:37.930 
that loop that we made which is right

00:02:37.930 --> 00:02:41.820 
that loop that we made which is right
here<00:02:38.190> going<00:02:39.190> to<00:02:39.250> lay<00:02:39.460> it<00:02:39.520> under<00:02:40.710> you're<00:02:41.710> going

00:02:41.820 --> 00:02:41.830 
here going to lay it under you're going

00:02:41.830 --> 00:02:43.320 
here going to lay it under you're going
to<00:02:41.890> hold<00:02:42.160> it<00:02:42.340> with<00:02:42.430> your<00:02:42.490> finger<00:02:42.970> with<00:02:43.180> this

00:02:43.320 --> 00:02:43.330 
to hold it with your finger with this

00:02:43.330 --> 00:02:46.200 
to hold it with your finger with this
finger<00:02:43.570> so<00:02:43.840> it<00:02:43.930> doesn't<00:02:44.260> get<00:02:44.350> loose<00:02:44.880> lay<00:02:45.880> down

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:46.210 
finger so it doesn't get loose lay down

00:02:46.210 --> 00:02:50.070 
finger so it doesn't get loose lay down
like<00:02:46.450> that<00:02:48.030> make<00:02:49.030> a<00:02:49.060> couple<00:02:49.360> turns<00:02:49.690> four<00:02:50.020> or

00:02:50.070 --> 00:02:50.080 
like that make a couple turns four or

00:02:50.080 --> 00:02:58.440 
like that make a couple turns four or
five<00:02:50.260> turns<00:02:52.080> make<00:02:53.080> a<00:02:53.110> cut<00:02:56.160> take<00:02:57.160> that<00:02:57.370> red<00:02:57.640> tag

00:02:58.440 --> 00:02:58.450 
five turns make a cut take that red tag

00:02:58.450 --> 00:03:02.040 
five turns make a cut take that red tag
end<00:02:58.780> and<00:02:59.050> put<00:03:00.010> it<00:03:00.130> through<00:03:00.280> the<00:03:00.400> loop<00:03:00.520> pull<00:03:01.050> the

00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:02.050 
end and put it through the loop pull the

00:03:02.050 --> 00:03:04.590 
end and put it through the loop pull the
loop<00:03:02.230> through<00:03:03.090> then<00:03:04.090> you're<00:03:04.240> going<00:03:04.360> to<00:03:04.450> pull

00:03:04.590 --> 00:03:04.600 
loop through then you're going to pull

00:03:04.600 --> 00:03:07.340 
loop through then you're going to pull
it<00:03:04.720> back<00:03:05.550> make<00:03:06.550> a<00:03:06.580> cut

00:03:07.340 --> 00:03:07.350 
it back make a cut

00:03:07.350 --> 00:03:12.150 
it back make a cut
there's<00:03:08.350> your<00:03:08.590> base<00:03:08.770> wrap<00:03:10.020> nice<00:03:11.020> now<00:03:11.680> what<00:03:12.010> we

00:03:12.150 --> 00:03:12.160 
there's your base wrap nice now what we

00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:16.170 
there's your base wrap nice now what we
did<00:03:12.400> is<00:03:12.610> we<00:03:12.670> had<00:03:13.360> a<00:03:13.390> I<00:03:13.720> ground<00:03:14.650> the<00:03:14.920> foot<00:03:15.220> of<00:03:15.400> the

00:03:16.170 --> 00:03:16.180 
did is we had a I ground the foot of the

00:03:16.180 --> 00:03:19.170 
did is we had a I ground the foot of the
guy<00:03:16.390> I<00:03:16.780> grounded<00:03:17.590> down<00:03:17.800> so<00:03:18.130> it's<00:03:18.340> show<00:03:18.730> up<00:03:18.850> sort

00:03:19.170 --> 00:03:19.180 
guy I grounded down so it's show up sort

00:03:19.180 --> 00:03:21.240 
guy I grounded down so it's show up sort
of<00:03:19.240> let<00:03:19.480> the<00:03:19.690> thread<00:03:20.440> will<00:03:20.620> go<00:03:20.770> up<00:03:20.950> nice<00:03:21.220> and

00:03:21.240 --> 00:03:21.250 
of let the thread will go up nice and

00:03:21.250 --> 00:03:25.590 
of let the thread will go up nice and
even<00:03:22.200> now<00:03:23.200> what<00:03:23.410> I'm<00:03:23.530> going<00:03:23.709> to<00:03:23.770> do<00:03:23.950> is<00:03:24.640> lay<00:03:25.420> the

00:03:25.590 --> 00:03:25.600 
even now what I'm going to do is lay the

00:03:25.600 --> 00:03:30.600 
even now what I'm going to do is lay the
guide<00:03:26.280> on<00:03:27.280> the<00:03:27.490> center<00:03:28.890> with<00:03:29.890> a<00:03:29.920> rubber<00:03:30.130> band

00:03:30.600 --> 00:03:30.610 
guide on the center with a rubber band

00:03:30.610 --> 00:03:35.280 
guide on the center with a rubber band
we'll<00:03:31.060> hold<00:03:31.270> it<00:03:32.100> temporary<00:03:33.100> hold<00:03:33.370> yep<00:03:34.290> then

00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:35.290 
we'll hold it temporary hold yep then

00:03:35.290 --> 00:03:37.199 
we'll hold it temporary hold yep then
going<00:03:35.440> to<00:03:35.470> take<00:03:35.560> my<00:03:35.739> calipers<00:03:36.340> just<00:03:36.640> kind<00:03:37.090> of

00:03:37.199 --> 00:03:37.209 
going to take my calipers just kind of

00:03:37.209 --> 00:03:41.460 
going to take my calipers just kind of
Center<00:03:37.480> it<00:03:38.280> somewhat<00:03:39.810> there<00:03:40.810> you<00:03:40.900> go<00:03:41.080> the

00:03:41.460 --> 00:03:41.470 
Center it somewhat there you go the

00:03:41.470 --> 00:03:44.310 
Center it somewhat there you go the
guides<00:03:41.739> in<00:03:41.950> the<00:03:42.070> center<00:03:42.660> where<00:03:43.660> it<00:03:43.780> has<00:03:43.930> to<00:03:44.140> be

00:03:44.310 --> 00:03:44.320 
guides in the center where it has to be

00:03:44.320 --> 00:03:46.680 
guides in the center where it has to be
just<00:03:44.980> it<00:03:45.220> a<00:03:45.250> little<00:03:45.459> bit<00:03:45.670> rubber<00:03:46.090> band<00:03:46.330> holds

00:03:46.680 --> 00:03:46.690 
just it a little bit rubber band holds

00:03:46.690 --> 00:03:51.259 
just it a little bit rubber band holds
it<00:03:47.489> now<00:03:48.489> I'm<00:03:48.640> going<00:03:48.760> to<00:03:48.820> put<00:03:48.970> the<00:03:49.060> over<00:03:49.360> wrap<00:03:49.540> on

00:03:51.259 --> 00:03:51.269 
it now I'm going to put the over wrap on

00:03:51.269 --> 00:03:55.020 
it now I'm going to put the over wrap on
which<00:03:52.269> I'm<00:03:52.480> going<00:03:52.630> to<00:03:52.690> use<00:03:52.750> black<00:03:53.760> so<00:03:54.760> you<00:03:54.820> can

00:03:55.020 --> 00:03:55.030 
which I'm going to use black so you can

00:03:55.030 --> 00:03:58.119 
which I'm going to use black so you can
see

00:03:58.119 --> 00:03:58.129 

00:03:58.129 --> 00:04:00.399 

I<00:03:58.159> got<00:03:58.730> to<00:03:58.819> fix<00:03:58.969> my<00:03:59.090> loop<00:03:59.390> and<00:03:59.599> this<00:04:00.049> is<00:04:00.170> called

00:04:00.399 --> 00:04:00.409 
I got to fix my loop and this is called

00:04:00.409 --> 00:04:05.530 
I got to fix my loop and this is called
the<00:04:00.499> over<00:04:00.739> wrap<00:04:00.920> this<00:04:01.249> is<00:04:01.400> the<00:04:01.519> overlap<00:04:04.540> okay

00:04:05.530 --> 00:04:05.540 
the over wrap this is the overlap okay

00:04:05.540 --> 00:04:09.949 
the over wrap this is the overlap okay
now<00:04:05.719> you're<00:04:05.900> going<00:04:06.019> to<00:04:06.109> take<00:04:06.769> that

00:04:09.949 --> 00:04:09.959 

00:04:09.959 --> 00:04:16.520 

pull<00:04:10.470> it<00:04:10.620> straighten<00:04:11.129> it

00:04:16.520 --> 00:04:16.530 

00:04:16.530 --> 00:04:22.890 

make<00:04:17.010> a<00:04:17.040> couple<00:04:17.310> turns<00:04:19.880> cut<00:04:20.880> it

00:04:22.890 --> 00:04:22.900 
make a couple turns cut it

00:04:22.900 --> 00:04:33.770 
make a couple turns cut it
now<00:04:23.900> peshitta<00:04:24.380> rap

00:04:33.770 --> 00:04:33.780 

00:04:33.780 --> 00:04:35.900 

now<00:04:34.320> you<00:04:34.380> stop<00:04:34.950> before<00:04:35.190> you<00:04:35.430> get<00:04:35.550> all<00:04:35.760> the<00:04:35.820> way

up pull the rubber band off that was

00:04:39.210 --> 00:04:42.160 
up pull the rubber band off that was
pretty<00:04:39.390> good<00:04:39.540> pop<00:04:39.920> take<00:04:40.920> your<00:04:41.130> loop<00:04:41.340> again

00:04:42.160 --> 00:04:42.170 
pretty good pop take your loop again

00:04:58.689 --> 00:04:58.699 
make a cut through the loop through the

00:04:58.699 --> 00:05:00.520 
make a cut through the loop through the
loop<00:04:58.910> now<00:04:59.539> watch<00:04:59.780> you're<00:04:59.990> going<00:05:00.110> to<00:05:00.169> pull<00:05:00.380> that
