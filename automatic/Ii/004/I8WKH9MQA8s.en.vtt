the<00:02:01.370> only<00:02:01.610> critique<00:02:01.820> I<00:02:02.120> would<00:02:02.270> have<00:02:02.480> with<00:02:02.720> this

00:02:02.890 --> 00:02:02.900 
the only critique I would have with this

00:02:02.900 --> 00:02:05.770 
the only critique I would have with this
is<00:02:03.140> that<00:02:03.290> it<00:02:03.710> was<00:02:03.830> quite<00:02:04.160> unevenly<00:02:05.150> caught<00:02:05.510> and

00:02:05.770 --> 00:02:05.780 
is that it was quite unevenly caught and

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:08.229 
is that it was quite unevenly caught and
that<00:02:06.260> is<00:02:06.410> often<00:02:06.680> even<00:02:07.550> though<00:02:07.850> it's<00:02:07.970> broken

00:02:08.229 --> 00:02:08.239

00:02:08.239 --> 00:02:11.680 
that is often even though it's broken
flake<00:02:08.959> and<00:02:09.399> not<00:02:10.399> just<00:02:10.580> a<00:02:10.670> regular<00:02:10.849> flake<00:02:11.330> like

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:11.690 
flake and not just a regular flake like

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:13.210 
flake and not just a regular flake like
for<00:02:12.020> Virginia<00:02:12.320> flake<00:02:12.530> but<00:02:12.950> that<00:02:13.100> is<00:02:13.190> a

00:02:13.210 --> 00:02:13.220 
for Virginia flake but that is a

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:13.910 
for Virginia flake but that is a

00:04:16.859 --> 00:04:18.110 
much I smoked it in very quickly and I
didn't<00:04:17.070> really<00:04:17.160> give<00:04:17.340> it<00:04:17.430> much<00:04:17.459> time<00:04:17.820> to<00:04:17.970> sit

00:04:18.110 --> 00:04:18.120 
didn't really give it much time to sit

00:04:18.120 --> 00:04:20.060 
didn't really give it much time to sit
on<00:04:18.150> a<00:04:18.239> shelf<00:04:18.329> or<00:04:18.630> dry<00:04:18.780> out<00:04:18.959> however<00:04:19.829> at<00:04:19.950> the

00:04:20.060 --> 00:04:20.070 
on a shelf or dry out however at the

00:04:20.070 --> 00:04:22.339 
on a shelf or dry out however at the
packet<00:04:20.430> plant<00:04:20.639> in<00:04:20.850> the<00:04:21.030> pound<00:04:21.299> box<00:04:21.750> for<00:04:22.320> the

00:04:22.339 --> 00:04:22.349 
packet plant in the pound box for the

00:04:22.349 --> 00:04:24.680 
packet plant in the pound box for the
bolt<00:04:22.770> blend<00:04:23.039> in<00:04:23.190> the<00:04:23.280> pound<00:04:23.490> box<00:04:23.849> I<00:04:24.090> found<00:04:24.360> was

00:04:24.680 --> 00:04:24.690 
bolt blend in the pound box I found was

00:04:24.690 --> 00:04:25.860 
bolt blend in the pound box I found was
even<00:04:24.930> nicer<00:04:25.110> because<00:04:25.349> was<00:04:25.560> a<00:04:25.650> bit

00:04:25.860 --> 00:04:25.870 
even nicer because was a bit

00:04:25.870 --> 00:04:29.100 
even nicer because was a bit
more<00:04:25.990> dried<00:04:26.229> out<00:04:26.260> and<00:04:27.330> it<00:04:28.330> was<00:04:28.389> actually<00:04:28.630> even

00:04:29.100 --> 00:04:29.110 
more dried out and it was actually even

00:04:29.110 --> 00:04:31.290 
more dried out and it was actually even
more<00:04:29.350> enjoyable<00:04:29.800> so<00:04:30.430> that's<00:04:30.790> a<00:04:30.880> bit<00:04:31.030> unique

00:04:31.290 --> 00:04:31.300 
more enjoyable so that's a bit unique

00:04:31.300 --> 00:04:33.030 
more enjoyable so that's a bit unique
sometimes<00:04:31.810> the<00:04:31.930> bulb<00:04:32.139> blends<00:04:32.410> don't<00:04:32.710> tend<00:04:32.949> to

00:04:33.030 --> 00:04:33.040 
sometimes the bulb blends don't tend to

00:04:33.040 --> 00:04:36.750 
sometimes the bulb blends don't tend to
be<00:04:33.160> as<00:04:33.250> nice<00:04:33.400> as<00:04:33.639> the<00:04:33.729> tin<00:04:33.940> blends<00:04:35.190> but<00:04:36.190> that

00:04:36.750 --> 00:04:36.760 
be as nice as the tin blends but that

00:04:36.760 --> 00:04:41.640 
be as nice as the tin blends but that
was<00:04:37.590> that<00:04:38.590> was<00:04:38.710> an<00:04:38.860> exception<00:04:40.260> now<00:04:41.260> pipe

00:05:18.360 --> 00:05:18.370 
photographs researching so yeah Cobo and

00:05:18.370 --> 00:05:21.540 
photographs researching so yeah Cobo and
they<00:05:19.030> do<00:05:19.090> have<00:05:19.300> a<00:05:19.389> very<00:05:19.570> small<00:05:19.690> tip<00:05:20.550> which

00:05:21.540 --> 00:05:21.550 
they do have a very small tip which

00:05:21.550 --> 00:05:22.980 
they do have a very small tip which
means<00:05:21.760> you<00:05:21.850> can't<00:05:22.090> quite<00:05:22.510> difficult<00:05:22.750> to

00:05:22.980 --> 00:05:22.990 
means you can't quite difficult to

00:05:22.990 --> 00:05:24.810 
means you can't quite difficult to
clench<00:05:23.289> and<00:05:23.530> also<00:05:24.130> the<00:05:24.220> fact<00:05:24.400> that<00:05:24.490> this<00:05:24.639> is

00:05:24.810 --> 00:05:24.820 
clench and also the fact that this is

00:05:24.820 --> 00:05:27.300 
clench and also the fact that this is
quite<00:05:25.000> a<00:05:25.030> fat<00:05:25.419> stem<00:05:26.350> and<00:05:26.560> it's<00:05:26.680> not<00:05:26.919> a<00:05:26.949> love<00:05:27.220> it

00:05:27.300 --> 00:05:27.310 
quite a fat stem and it's not a love it

00:05:27.310 --> 00:05:30.140 
quite a fat stem and it's not a love it
it's<00:05:27.460> not<00:05:27.610> a<00:05:27.669> saddle<00:05:28.090> bit<00:05:28.240> it's<00:05:28.539> also<00:05:28.720> quite

00:05:30.140 --> 00:05:30.150 
it's not a saddle bit it's also quite

00:05:30.150 --> 00:05:33.000 
it's not a saddle bit it's also quite
quite<00:05:31.150> difficult<00:05:31.330> to<00:05:31.539> clench<00:05:31.840> but<00:05:32.650> it's<00:05:32.889> a

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:33.010 
quite difficult to clench but it's a

00:05:33.010 --> 00:05:36.480 
quite difficult to clench but it's a
very<00:05:33.310> good<00:05:33.370> pipe<00:05:34.270> and<00:05:34.570> I<00:05:35.410> paid<00:05:35.860> very<00:05:36.160> very

00:05:36.480 --> 00:05:36.490 
very good pipe and I paid very very

00:05:36.490 --> 00:05:40.860 
very good pipe and I paid very very
little<00:05:36.700> for<00:05:37.030> it<00:05:37.180> and<00:05:38.849> it's<00:05:39.849> filter<00:05:40.240> pipe<00:05:40.450> n<00:05:40.630> and

00:05:40.860 --> 00:05:40.870 
little for it and it's filter pipe n and

00:05:40.870 --> 00:05:42.750 
little for it and it's filter pipe n and
I<00:05:40.930> don't<00:05:41.139> most<00:05:41.620> of<00:05:41.770> my<00:05:41.860> high<00:05:42.039> grade<00:05:42.370> super

but not most my hot super hydrates
aren't<00:05:56.500> filter<00:05:56.740> pipes<00:05:56.979> so<00:05:57.280> I<00:05:57.310> you<00:05:57.970> know<00:05:58.000> I

00:05:58.110 --> 00:05:58.120 
aren't filter pipes so I you know I

00:05:58.120 --> 00:05:59.730 
aren't filter pipes so I you know I
really<00:05:58.330> like<00:05:58.510> that<00:05:58.539> was<00:05:58.840> weak<00:05:59.110> cheap<00:05:59.470> price

00:05:59.730 --> 00:05:59.740 
really like that was weak cheap price
