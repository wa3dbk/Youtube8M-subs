00:00:12.740 --> 00:00:16.960
 hello girls how are you to greet and in 

00:00:14.870 --> 00:00:21.560
 today we are going to make a beautiful 

00:00:16.960 --> 00:00:25.130
 cloth plush vest as they say in 

00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:28.579
 English that is an out once this is a 

00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:33.320
 fabric like stuffed or plush cloth or 

00:00:28.579 --> 00:00:35.420
 imitation of animal skin then 

00:00:33.320 --> 00:00:38.390
 you buy the fabric that you 

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:40.879
 like this I bought this that I loved 

00:00:38.390 --> 00:00:43.580
 that fascinated me and then simply 

00:00:40.879 --> 00:00:46.460
 here already lived I saw characterized what I 

00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:50.000
 I want to do this is super simple 

00:00:46.460 --> 00:00:53.040
 to actually do this I am going to try 

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:54.930
 to do in the simplest way 

00:00:53.040 --> 00:00:57.570
 although girls we are going to place the 

00:00:54.930 --> 00:01:00.890
 fabric in double the way as you 

00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:03.800
 want the fabric to stay 

00:01:00.890 --> 00:01:05.690
 and so we're going to put our mold in 

00:01:03.800 --> 00:01:07.040
 The top 

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:08.840
 at this moment they do not realize 

00:01:07.040 --> 00:01:10.659
 I bought the fabric exactly like who 

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:12.520
 He says 

00:01:10.659 --> 00:01:14.319
 this the length is going to be the long 

00:01:12.520 --> 00:01:16.179
 you want me to give it the same 

00:01:14.319 --> 00:01:19.140
 long I have this blouse I will mark 

00:01:16.179 --> 00:01:19.140
 myself long 

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:23.420
 Shoulder fall shoulder 

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:30.720
 Casting in this post I'll mark 

00:01:27.480 --> 00:01:31.890
 my shoulder remember to make him fall 

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:34.550
 of the shoulder so that then there is no 

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:38.140
 stopped ugly but it falls well pretty 

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:40.000
 We will mark the armhole 

00:01:38.140 --> 00:01:42.580
 what we are going to consider here 

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:44.530
 when we are going to do the armhole is that 

00:01:42.580 --> 00:01:45.670
 like this to have to stay a miss 

00:01:44.530 --> 00:01:49.400
 little bit wider because logically 

00:01:45.670 --> 00:01:51.590
 down will wear a blouse 

00:01:49.400 --> 00:01:54.440
 a sweater or a shirt like you 

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:57.020
 they want to call the neck I'm going to do 

00:01:54.440 --> 00:02:00.190
 about 15 centimeters because for 

00:01:57.020 --> 00:02:00.190
 make him the fake 

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:10.110
 in the back in the video what 

00:02:06.729 --> 00:02:10.110
 let's do with about 2 centimeters 

00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:18.440
 we are going to sew it 

00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:21.710
 we are simply going to possess the shoulders 

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:25.010
 let's sew the sides 

00:02:21.710 --> 00:02:26.900
 I'm going to do with filleting let 

00:02:25.010 --> 00:02:28.640
 to try to do here is that we're going to 

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:29.660
 try the hairs to throw them for 

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:32.180
 in 

00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:35.830
 from both sides so that when you 

00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:35.830
 let's move the charterer to face 

00:02:39.770 --> 00:02:42.220
 A) Yes 

00:02:42.980 --> 00:02:48.790
 our shoulders is very important that 

00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:48.790
 the fall of the shoulder fall well pretty 

00:02:55.980 --> 00:03:01.260
 at this time so we have the vest 

00:02:58.230 --> 00:03:03.530
 I loved him up here to me 

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:06.299
 love how I put it to fall 

00:03:03.530 --> 00:03:07.560
 then this is actually optional if 

00:03:06.299 --> 00:03:10.349
 I recommend it a lot because logically 

00:03:07.560 --> 00:03:13.920
 I do not know how this will work this 

00:03:10.349 --> 00:03:15.430
 material if it is going to fray or leaves 

00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:17.799
 of barataria 

00:03:15.430 --> 00:03:20.940
 you can do two things that we can 

00:03:17.799 --> 00:03:26.010
 pass filleting all around 

00:03:20.940 --> 00:03:28.170
 and then make a little fake for 

00:03:26.010 --> 00:03:29.670
 What I 'm going to do is what I 

00:03:28.170 --> 00:03:31.200
 I'm going to do to really prevent 

00:03:29.670 --> 00:03:34.680
 because I'm not going to cover it because 

00:03:31.200 --> 00:03:37.860
 it is quite thick is this this 

00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:39.180
 it is very fashionable this can be used to 

00:03:37.860 --> 00:03:42.629
 now what is the transition of the 

00:03:39.180 --> 00:03:45.299
 winter to spring that is already 

00:03:42.629 --> 00:03:48.420
 cool but it's not so cold anymore and it looks 

00:03:45.299 --> 00:03:49.980
 very very very precious then I what 

00:03:48.420 --> 00:03:51.540
 I can do simply is that everything 

00:03:49.980 --> 00:03:54.150
 around I'm going to pass it 

00:03:51.540 --> 00:03:55.950
 fileteadora and then I will do nothing 

00:03:54.150 --> 00:03:57.480
 more as I'm going to grab the firm you 

00:03:55.950 --> 00:04:00.239
 love everything around then I will give 

00:03:57.480 --> 00:04:04.260
 a little turn and I'm going to make it 

00:04:00.239 --> 00:04:06.690
 a very nice thin hem and 

00:04:04.260 --> 00:04:10.190
 that's going to be my finish and it's back with 

00:04:06.690 --> 00:04:13.769
 photos so you can see how this looks 

00:04:10.190 --> 00:04:15.810
 beautiful plush vest then already 

00:04:13.769 --> 00:04:17.729
 this is completely finished 

00:04:15.810 --> 00:04:19.530
 vest is on the back side 

00:04:17.729 --> 00:04:22.280
 I just wanted to share with you 

00:04:19.530 --> 00:04:24.780
 how it looked nice 

00:04:22.280 --> 00:04:26.039
 how I did not put on lining or anything else 

00:04:24.780 --> 00:04:27.930
 What I did was to pass the 

00:04:26.039 --> 00:04:31.530
 filleting machine 

00:04:27.930 --> 00:04:34.169
 all around and then I catch you fake 

00:04:31.530 --> 00:04:37.470
 by hand all around 

00:04:34.169 --> 00:04:40.979
 Look, it was very beautiful and in this way 

00:04:37.470 --> 00:04:45.889
 I'm protecting the factory or my 

00:04:40.979 --> 00:04:45.889
 vest that is not owed to me 

00:04:46.220 --> 00:04:50.720
 and then this is the part of the backwards 

00:04:48.170 --> 00:04:53.480
 and it's in my part d 

00:04:50.720 --> 00:04:55.160
 to the right good girls I hope that you 

00:04:53.480 --> 00:04:58.580

00:04:55.160 --> 00:04:59.900

00:04:58.580 --> 00:05:01.580
