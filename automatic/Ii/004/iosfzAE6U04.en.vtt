00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.060
 We are still up late 

00:00:01.230 --> 00:00:04.710
 facebook about strong protagonist 

00:00:03.060 --> 00:00:07.259
 That's why there is today 

00:00:04.710 --> 00:00:09.420
 the matching list of books with 

00:00:07.259 --> 00:00:10.889
 strong protagonists for you and 

00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:12.509
 Although I start with a book to what 

00:00:10.889 --> 00:00:12.929
 many of you certainly from school 

00:00:12.509 --> 00:00:14.370
 know 

00:00:12.929 --> 00:00:15.929
 I was at that time at least in the 

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:18.029
 German lessons forced to first 

00:00:15.929 --> 00:00:19.949
 but reading was surprisingly wise 

00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:21.330
 in fact excited about the book so 

00:00:19.949 --> 00:00:22.619
 It was one of those few books 

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:24.060
 one reads in school though one 

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:24.660
 That was pretty much behind saying 

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:26.699
 cool 

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:29.699
 and that's about the island of blue 

00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:31.560
 dolphins of scott model in the book 

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:32.969
 it's about an Indian girl so of 

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:34.200
 The story comes from I think that's one 

00:00:32.969 --> 00:00:36.420
 bit like cast away 

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:38.489
 she has no accident but she stays 

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:39.480
 all alone on an island and back 

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:41.129
 must survive there 

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:42.690
 This island is surrounded by many 

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:45.539
 Do not call dolphins in the South Seas 

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:46.829
 And it really takes years to finally 

00:00:45.539 --> 00:00:48.809
 once again a human meets her 

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:49.649
 her story is told here and 

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:52.140
 that's just super interesting 

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:55.469
 made all this story as she did 

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:58.020
 Survive as you do in terms of water and food 

00:00:55.469 --> 00:00:59.850
 comes and how it sounds about and 

00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:01.739
 What she actually spent years alone on 

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:03.809
 This island is very exciting and exciting 

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:04.949
 a very strong protagonist continues 

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:06.360
 is it with a book of mine 

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:07.920
 just do not get tired of it too 

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:10.170
 recommend the everyday 

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:12.420
 Physics of the misfortune of Maria Passes in 

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:14.970
 The book is about blue, her father 

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:16.680
 University professor is and constantly 

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:18.540
 the city changes that means it has to 

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:19.979
 move with him and is somehow 

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:21.990
 always alone because you only short 

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:23.130
 time lives in a new place then has 

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:24.630
 Of course not necessarily the 

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:26.640
 Opportunity immediately new friends too 

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:28.530
 make and in this story it works 

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:30.630
 Just live around blues like these 

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:32.009
 Whole constant removes perceives how 

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:33.900
 Slowly in this whole time 

00:01:32.009 --> 00:01:35.369
 grow up and what interests 

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:37.110
 she actually has the book that way 

00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:39.570
 incredibly special because it is also very 

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:42.119
 very many references to other books 

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:43.680
 and to sing and to film one has 

00:01:42.119 --> 00:01:45.210
 there is all the time in itself 

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:47.130
 again and you have fun 

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:49.200
 Do something wrong with her 

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:50.250
 to track writing style and theirs 

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:52.140
 to read history 

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:53.790
 and on it goes with a book what 

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:56.219
 first like a children's book but weighs 

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:59.369
 which is absolutely great for adults too 

00:01:56.219 --> 00:02:01.649
 and indeed one of her came neil 

00:01:59.369 --> 00:02:03.600
 Gaiman is known as one of the fantasy 

00:02:01.649 --> 00:02:05.130
 authors at all and that absolutely too 

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:08.459
 right because he always manages to do it 

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:11.129
 super exciting super quirky and too 

00:02:08.459 --> 00:02:12.390
 totally intelligent new worlds and new ones 

00:02:11.129 --> 00:02:13.180
 to create scenarios 

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:14.829
 in the book goes 

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:16.329
 as the title suggests and corel one 

00:02:14.829 --> 00:02:18.790
 with your parents in a new house 

00:02:16.329 --> 00:02:20.349
 This house is a very gloomy draws 

00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:23.379
 very old house somehow a bit 

00:02:20.349 --> 00:02:24.879
 scary and she is also constantly 

00:02:23.379 --> 00:02:25.569
 warned that something is not in there 

00:02:24.879 --> 00:02:27.519
 order is 

00:02:25.569 --> 00:02:30.099
 and one day she finds one 

00:02:27.519 --> 00:02:31.870
 Walled door in your house and there 

00:02:30.099 --> 00:02:33.189
 strange things disappear too 

00:02:31.870 --> 00:02:35.799
 Of course, she has to shadow everything 

00:02:33.189 --> 00:02:38.109
 to track down and I'll tell you now 

00:02:35.799 --> 00:02:39.639
 not how it goes on but a great one 

00:02:38.109 --> 00:02:41.739
 book for adults and children 

00:02:39.639 --> 00:02:43.930
 equally a bit of fantasy 

00:02:41.739 --> 00:02:46.090
 a bit of a scare and above all 

00:02:43.930 --> 00:02:48.519
 strong protagonist you already know it 

00:02:46.090 --> 00:02:50.049
 I also always have a classic with 

00:02:48.519 --> 00:02:51.849
 bring in a little something for that 

00:02:50.049 --> 00:02:53.109
 Education, so to speak, and my classic 

00:02:51.849 --> 00:02:55.150
 this time with a very strong 

00:02:53.109 --> 00:02:57.400
 protagonist is the scarlet 

00:02:55.150 --> 00:02:58.950
 Letter from Nathaniel Hawthorne 

00:02:57.400 --> 00:03:02.980
 the book is a true classic 

00:02:58.950 --> 00:03:05.739
 simply because it is already very old 

00:03:02.980 --> 00:03:08.620
 is and it's about a woman named 

00:03:05.739 --> 00:03:10.419
 hester print who is an adulteress 

00:03:08.620 --> 00:03:12.489
 the whole thing is playing in boston 

00:03:10.419 --> 00:03:15.340
 seventeenth century that is to say straight 

00:03:12.489 --> 00:03:18.729
 to the beginnings of america as the whole 

00:03:15.340 --> 00:03:20.530
 Settlers there only arrived and 

00:03:18.729 --> 00:03:22.269
 yes, at that time politics was still one 

00:03:20.530 --> 00:03:24.310
 was a bit different compared to women 

00:03:22.269 --> 00:03:26.470
 behave differently and adulterers 

00:03:24.310 --> 00:03:28.359
 were punished incredibly hard 

00:03:26.470 --> 00:03:30.400
 hester will now be there for you 

00:03:28.359 --> 00:03:32.379
 Adulteress is indeed public 

00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:34.930
 branded she gets 

00:03:32.379 --> 00:03:37.629
 scarlet embroidered on hers 

00:03:34.930 --> 00:03:39.280
 clothing and thus with this shame 

00:03:37.629 --> 00:03:41.229
 she has to run around and live her now 

00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:43.479
 lead and we pursue the whole 

00:03:41.229 --> 00:03:45.909
 second he instructed if she will go again 

00:03:43.479 --> 00:03:46.540
 feet and how people are with her 

00:03:45.909 --> 00:03:48.939
 bypass 

00:03:46.540 --> 00:03:50.439
 she is a very very strong woman because 

00:03:48.939 --> 00:03:52.599
 how she acts the situation 

00:03:50.439 --> 00:03:54.519
 scary interesting written and 

00:03:52.599 --> 00:03:57.220
 also very exciting and with and before 

00:03:54.519 --> 00:03:58.840
 all moving a classic too 

00:03:57.220 --> 00:04:00.310
 I can recommend so I think he 

00:03:58.840 --> 00:04:01.599
 probably already about 8 million at 

00:04:00.310 --> 00:04:03.639
 maybe you are already filmed 

00:04:01.599 --> 00:04:06.129
 times about one of the filming encountered 

00:04:03.639 --> 00:04:09.310
 I can only recommend it goes on 

00:04:06.129 --> 00:04:12.430
 with a novel by Isabel 

00:04:09.310 --> 00:04:14.709
 allende fortunas daughters the whole is 

00:04:12.430 --> 00:04:17.680
 a somewhat multicultural book here 

00:04:14.709 --> 00:04:19.810

00:04:17.680 --> 00:04:22.029

00:04:19.810 --> 00:04:24.760
 British parents are raised this 

00:04:22.029 --> 00:04:25.770
 book now tells her story on the 

00:04:24.760 --> 00:04:28.259
 search for 

00:04:25.770 --> 00:04:30.419
 adventure and freedom and also 

00:04:28.259 --> 00:04:32.789
