00:00:02.560 --> 00:00:07.040
 a good morning to all engine lovers 

00:00:05.089 --> 00:00:10.040
 and welcome to this new installment of 

00:00:07.040 --> 00:00:11.810
 let's discover the engines today as required 

00:00:10.040 --> 00:00:14.210
 from some youtubers we will explain the 

00:00:11.810 --> 00:00:16.340
 change operation explain the 

00:00:14.210 --> 00:00:18.370
 operation of the gearbox is not simple 

00:00:16.340 --> 00:00:20.510
 the data which is composed of many parts 

00:00:18.370 --> 00:00:23.720
 however we will try to understand in a way 

00:00:20.510 --> 00:00:25.820
 intuitive how it works 

00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:28.160
 I start by saying that this part is a bit 

00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:30.260
 complicated but when we move on to three 

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:32.230
 stages of a vehicle's movement will be 

00:00:30.260 --> 00:00:34.940
 easier to understand 

00:00:32.230 --> 00:00:38.030
 let's start from the clutch a 

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:39.649
 fundamental component for spare parts 

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:42.320
 clutch is composed of a single plate 

00:00:39.649 --> 00:00:44.540
 to the crankshaft is a disc equipped with 

00:00:42.320 --> 00:00:46.370
 patti who is united with the tree in 

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:48.440
 entrance to the camp 

00:00:46.370 --> 00:00:51.739
 the latter the incoming tree of the 

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:54.079
 exchange is called the primary shaft because 

00:00:51.739 --> 00:00:56.329
 it is the part that arrow line 

00:00:54.079 --> 00:00:58.489
 has been providing movement 

00:00:56.329 --> 00:01:00.739
 to the bodies of the exchange said in a few 

00:00:58.489 --> 00:01:04.309
 words was part of the drive shaft more 

00:01:00.739 --> 00:01:06.649
 near the field on the primary tree 

00:01:04.309 --> 00:01:09.319
 in addition to the clutch discs they are keyed 

00:01:06.649 --> 00:01:11.990
 in neutral 5 different gears 

00:01:09.319 --> 00:01:14.509
 commonly called marches divided by 

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:16.869
 number of teeth and diameter which 

00:01:14.509 --> 00:01:20.090
 differentiate the length of the reports 

00:01:16.869 --> 00:01:22.009
 for keyed in crowds means to say that 

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:24.049
 between the first gear train e 

00:01:22.009 --> 00:01:26.450
 the primary tree is placed 

00:01:24.049 --> 00:01:28.969
 bearings called bronzes in forums 

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:30.950
 limits which allow the two parties 

00:01:28.969 --> 00:01:34.249
 not to be bound in the rotation 

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:36.200
 all this means mean 

00:01:34.249 --> 00:01:38.450
 that while the primary tree turns to one 

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:41.460
 certain speed the other gears 

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:46.170
 they could also move it 

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:50.159
 Let us now turn to the three phases of the phase case 

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:53.869
 1 car stops clutch was then 

00:01:50.159 --> 00:01:56.759
 pedal released shift in neutral 

00:01:53.869 --> 00:01:58.619
 the main shaft and respective sleeves 

00:01:56.759 --> 00:02:00.210
 they run at the same rotation speed 

00:01:58.619 --> 00:02:01.800
 of the engine 

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:03.300
 the crankshaft gears in 

00:02:01.800 --> 00:02:05.070
 this time they are still 

00:02:03.300 --> 00:02:06.810
 since I am a company with the tree 

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:08.160
 secondary which is connected to 

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:10.950
 wheels 

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:13.830
 let's move on to the two car stop phase 

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:18.390
 diesel clutch was therefore pedal 

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:20.190
 pressed and graft of the first albeit not 

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:22.739
 there is more rigid connection between 

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:25.530
 engine and gearbox in fact the clutch is 

00:02:22.739 --> 00:02:29.370
 defused the primary continues to 

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:31.640
 turn the driver inertia new 

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:35.220
 crosswise to the lever to the left 

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:36.870
 inserting the first this involves 

00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:38.760
 the approach of the sleeve 

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:42.830
 selected towards the teeth 

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:42.830
 of the gear of the first note 

00:02:43.020 --> 00:02:47.400
 it must be said that thanks synchronizers 

00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:49.740
 between one march and another one avoids the 

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:51.630
 famous grated which would come 

00:02:49.740 --> 00:02:54.210
 produced by the groove 

00:02:51.630 --> 00:02:56.190
 of the stationary gear that scratches against 

00:02:54.210 --> 00:02:59.280
 the natural scale of the sleeve instead in 

00:02:56.190 --> 00:03:01.500
 movement and synchronizers allow 

00:02:59.280 --> 00:03:02.940
 to slow down the sleeve before that 

00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:07.710
 make contact with the gear 

00:03:02.940 --> 00:03:11.940
 of the march avoiding the scratching phase 

00:03:07.710 --> 00:03:15.240
 iii first triggered clutch engaged e 

00:03:11.940 --> 00:03:16.890
 car moving the teeth 

00:03:15.240 --> 00:03:19.400
 of the first gear is 

00:03:16.890 --> 00:03:22.980
 perfectly firm with the sleeve 

00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:24.510
 now listen well since the movement 

00:03:22.980 --> 00:03:26.370
 before arriving at the wheels comes 

00:03:24.510 --> 00:03:30.270
 transferred to different components of the 

00:03:26.370 --> 00:03:32.520
 I change the rotation and then the 

00:03:30.270 --> 00:03:35.850
 movement moves rigidly 

00:03:32.520 --> 00:03:37.500
 from the crankshaft to the clutch la 

00:03:35.850 --> 00:03:39.870
 which transfers the movement to the 

00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:42.390
 exchange rate primary than through the 

00:03:39.870 --> 00:03:45.060
 sleeve transfers it to the gear 

00:03:42.390 --> 00:03:46.380
 of the first rigidly connected with 

00:03:45.060 --> 00:03:48.620
 the tree is secondary 

00:03:46.380 --> 00:03:51.660
 which prefers the motion to the wheels 

00:03:48.620 --> 00:03:53.910
 this procedure is the same for all 

00:03:51.660 --> 00:03:55.770
 the marches forward obviously changing 

00:03:53.910 --> 00:03:58.550
 the sleeves selected according to 

00:03:55.770 --> 00:03:58.550
 chosen gear
