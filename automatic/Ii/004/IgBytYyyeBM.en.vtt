00:00:06.410 --> 00:00:12.580
 and here we are 

00:00:09.350 --> 00:00:15.940
 so many of our pills 

00:00:12.580 --> 00:00:19.790
 maintenance and today we will talk about the 

00:00:15.940 --> 00:00:21.680
 recording of the internal change and in 

00:00:19.790 --> 00:00:24.710
 below we'll talk about those in the gearbox 

00:00:21.680 --> 00:00:28.610
 then study down videos and then 

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:31.610
 will be separated then call at 

00:00:28.610 --> 00:00:35.750
 let's talk about it and let's get to work is like 

00:00:31.610 --> 00:00:40.220
 go and register the front gearbox 

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:42.949
 so our derailleur very much 

00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:46.750
 often it happens that with mountain use 

00:00:42.949 --> 00:00:49.909
 bike or how much it has fallen can be that 

00:00:46.750 --> 00:00:54.080
 or even with the use loosens the 

00:00:49.909 --> 00:00:56.690
 son of the gear so we will notice that it is 

00:00:54.080 --> 00:01:00.519
 once the gear has changed 

00:00:56.690 --> 00:01:03.920
 the chain will crash into the 

00:01:00.519 --> 00:01:08.290
 reader as we proceed first 

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:13.270
 you have to see that there is a correct one 

00:01:08.290 --> 00:01:18.130
 differences between distance between the last 

00:01:13.270 --> 00:01:23.030
 crown and the author's own 

00:01:18.130 --> 00:01:24.799
 then proceed in this way for the 

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:27.580
 relationship has bigger 

00:01:24.799 --> 00:01:31.810
 we put the 

00:01:27.580 --> 00:01:38.250
 chain precisely in the third crown 

00:01:31.810 --> 00:01:41.800
 and we lower everything from the back 

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:45.040
 twirling go to check that 

00:01:41.800 --> 00:01:49.360
 there is a suitable distance between the 

00:01:45.040 --> 00:01:52.780
 chain and the derailleur so as not to 

00:01:49.360 --> 00:01:57.580
 hinder normal operation 

00:01:52.780 --> 00:02:01.030
 this is a measurement you get 

00:01:57.580 --> 00:02:04.600
 30 the registration of the external screw 

00:02:01.030 --> 00:02:07.390
 going to live clockwise ne 

00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:10.330
 we see that the speaker is pressing towards 

00:02:07.390 --> 00:02:13.260
 the chain this price not made 

00:02:10.330 --> 00:02:13.260
 especially when 

00:02:13.319 --> 00:02:19.530
 when it happens that raising of gear 

00:02:17.879 --> 00:02:22.889
 our rally having to push 

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:27.870
 too far off the chain by making it 

00:02:22.889 --> 00:02:29.069
 get out this pedals to carry out 

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:32.730
 so as we have previously 

00:02:29.069 --> 00:02:34.799
 said inviting this life and therefore 

00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:37.560
 squeezing it clockwise 

00:02:34.799 --> 00:02:40.079
 He is approaching the real employer to 

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:43.319
 bicycle and living in a sense 

00:02:40.079 --> 00:02:45.870
 counterclockwise instead approaches pedal 

00:02:43.319 --> 00:02:48.299
 in the regulation must be made equal to 

00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:53.909
 eye coming out there were the measures e 

00:02:48.299 --> 00:02:55.620
 the types of interferences for the crown 

00:02:53.909 --> 00:03:00.650
 instead internal 

00:02:55.620 --> 00:03:07.949
 we will have the discussion in party we leave 

00:03:00.650 --> 00:03:09.930
 both the crown and the gun put 

00:03:07.949 --> 00:03:13.620
 to the point 

00:03:09.930 --> 00:03:16.739
 bicycle person and adjusting not 

00:03:13.620 --> 00:03:18.450
 then record the screw that is more 

00:03:16.739 --> 00:03:21.540
 internal always with the same 

00:03:18.450 --> 00:03:26.310
 therefore working in a student sense 

00:03:21.540 --> 00:03:28.639
 clockwise it goes away so yes 

00:03:26.310 --> 00:03:34.920
 approaches and the inner part of the derailleur 

00:03:28.639 --> 00:03:38.310
 incentive radio runs a 

00:03:34.920 --> 00:03:40.939
 once this adjustment is made and the 

00:03:38.310 --> 00:03:44.730
 our front gearbox then ours 

00:03:40.939 --> 00:03:47.659
 of the coach will work in a way 

00:03:44.730 --> 00:03:47.659
 regular
