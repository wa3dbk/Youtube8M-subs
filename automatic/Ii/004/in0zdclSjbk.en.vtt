00:00:01.140 --> 00:00:03.140
HervÃ© Cuisine in Iceland

00:00:06.380 --> 00:00:08.380
Hey everyone, I just landed in Iceland

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:14.360
this is going to be an intense discovery trip for me

00:00:15.920 --> 00:00:17.920
cooking, culture, people...

00:00:19.120 --> 00:00:21.120
I look forward to seeing the great Icelandic landscapes

00:00:21.120 --> 00:00:23.040
and share some great moments with Icelandic chefs

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:25.160
follow me !

00:00:29.874 --> 00:00:31.874
the first thing I wanted to do

00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:34.240
a stop at the Blue Lagoon

00:00:34.780 --> 00:00:36.780
with the geothermal waters

00:00:37.420 --> 00:00:39.420
with great properties for the skin !

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:42.480
I'm going home with a great skin for sure !

00:00:42.820 --> 00:00:44.820
it's only 6Â°C outside, and I'm going to bath in the hot waters

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:47.480
and this is only 3 hours away from Paris !

00:00:47.763 --> 00:00:49.763
check this out

00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:25.920
I'm starting with a fish plant

00:01:27.714 --> 00:01:29.714
they get fresh cod every morning

00:01:29.714 --> 00:01:31.660
straight from the ocean

00:01:35.534 --> 00:01:37.534
this is a very hight tech plant

00:01:37.534 --> 00:01:38.740
that cuts the fish into filets

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:45.340
and then the filets are finished and cleaned

00:01:45.340 --> 00:01:47.335
so it's ready to cook !

00:01:47.335 --> 00:01:50.055
high quality fish that stays at 0Â°C throughout the process

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:56.840
last step the fish is weighted

00:01:57.707 --> 00:01:59.707
packaged

00:01:59.740 --> 00:02:01.740
and ready to go by plane to our markets

00:02:01.774 --> 00:02:03.774
in the US and in Europe mostly

00:02:13.013 --> 00:02:15.013
thanks so much !

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:17.280
I'm leaving with 5 kilos of great cod filets

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:20.040
so I can go cook it with a local chef !

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:28.920
I don't think I can ever find a fresher fish

00:02:34.820 --> 00:02:36.820
see you later in the kitchen

00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:44.560
Now I'm a small port

00:02:45.375 --> 00:02:47.375
I'm going to try a local lobster soup

00:02:53.540 --> 00:02:55.540
and maybe try some dessert

00:03:15.520 --> 00:03:17.520
my favorite moment

00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:20.840
it looks like a pavlova cake

00:03:21.260 --> 00:03:23.260
with meringue and cream

00:03:23.554 --> 00:03:25.554
topped with caramel and nuts

00:03:35.860 --> 00:03:37.860
I promise, I'll get the recipe for you !

00:03:52.894 --> 00:03:54.894
Next going to cook my fresh cod 

00:03:57.014 --> 00:03:59.014
this will be a next video with the full recipe !!

00:04:39.084 --> 00:04:41.084
I'm at the geothermal park now

00:04:42.214 --> 00:04:44.214
it's very funny

00:04:45.620 --> 00:04:47.620
we're going to boil an egg is the hot water spring

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:08.000
and also look

00:05:09.515 --> 00:05:11.515
they are using the heat in the ground

00:05:11.515 --> 00:05:12.720
to bake bread !

00:05:16.660 --> 00:05:18.660
it's almost caramelised like a cake they say

00:05:18.660 --> 00:05:20.590
it cooks 24 hours in the ground at low temperature

00:05:27.441 --> 00:05:29.441
Let's try it out

00:05:34.955 --> 00:05:36.955
it looks moist

00:05:43.634 --> 00:05:45.634
Hummm

00:05:45.634 --> 00:05:46.500
a small caramel taste

00:05:47.620 --> 00:05:49.620
they add some brown sugar inside

00:05:53.080 --> 00:05:55.080
baked 24 hours

00:05:56.040 --> 00:05:58.040
it almost tastes like ginger bread

00:06:04.774 --> 00:06:06.774
the next day, I'm heading to meet chef Arni

00:06:07.380 --> 00:06:09.380
to cook icelandic lamb

00:06:53.854 --> 00:06:55.854
stay tuned, 2 recipes are coming !
