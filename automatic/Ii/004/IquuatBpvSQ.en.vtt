00:00:14.330 --> 00:00:19.619
 Hello my friends my name is the tree I 

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:22.590
 invite you to travel with 

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:29.460
 me and a bunch of great colleagues 

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:31.349
 shop on the air drug voyage so the first 

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:33.420
 the city to which we will go 

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:35.700
 this is barcelona magic city in which 

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:37.350
 I unfortunately did not have it too 

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:40.079
 now have the opportunity to enjoy 

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:41.130
 these beautiful views maybe this 

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:45.379
 not the end of the world 

00:00:41.130 --> 00:00:45.379
 that's the name of the next song 

00:00:47.990 --> 00:00:51.960
 next topic is especially close to me 

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:54.210
 because i'm sure that each 

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:58.020
 singer must sing sooner or later 

00:00:54.210 --> 00:01:00.900
 a song about the pilot behind me friske not 

00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:04.079

00:01:00.900 --> 00:01:06.390
 hold on to incredibly warm 

00:01:04.079 --> 00:01:09.110
 the sun and move under the white 

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:09.110

00:01:11.399 --> 00:01:17.110
 you know what, and for someone, and transportation 

00:01:14.320 --> 00:01:19.560
 to the cottage outside the city with the near suburbs 

00:01:17.110 --> 00:01:22.270
 this is also a great journey 

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:26.560
 so now let's take a dip 

00:01:22.270 --> 00:01:29.729

 know but perry seems very cool 

00:01:39.760 --> 00:01:44.540
 because not every change will allow 

00:01:42.410 --> 00:01:47.810

00:01:44.540 --> 00:01:49.100

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:07.649
 whether the girl from russia met 

00:02:05.399 --> 00:02:10.050
 went to Iran whether our Iranian attack 

00:02:07.649 --> 00:02:12.390
 came here to us in Russia but 

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:14.489
 the trip here obviously didnâ€™t work because 

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:16.470
