construction values have been going up
so<00:04:52.990> we're<00:04:53.200> at<00:04:53.350> kind<00:04:53.830> of<00:04:53.920> historic<00:04:54.400> high<00:04:54.550> levels

00:04:54.990 --> 00:04:55.000 
so we're at kind of historic high levels

00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:59.520 
so we're at kind of historic high levels
here<00:04:55.410> now<00:04:56.410> we<00:04:56.470> also<00:04:56.770> break<00:04:57.220> things<00:04:57.580> down<00:04:58.530> by

00:04:59.520 --> 00:04:59.530 
here now we also break things down by

00:04:59.530 --> 00:05:03.270 
here now we also break things down by
segments<00:05:00.070> again<00:05:00.340> so<00:05:00.670> here<00:05:01.120> is<00:05:01.540> just<00:05:01.870> the<00:05:02.280> 100

00:05:03.270 --> 00:05:03.280 
segments again so here is just the 100

00:05:03.280 --> 00:05:06.990 
segments again so here is just the 100
horse<00:05:03.520> and<00:05:03.820> under<00:05:04.330> used<00:05:04.900> tractor<00:05:05.410> values<00:05:06.000> and

00:05:06.990 --> 00:05:07.000 
horse and under used tractor values and

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:08.730 
horse and under used tractor values and
again<00:05:07.120> you<00:05:07.360> can<00:05:07.540> see<00:05:07.780> on<00:05:07.930> my<00:05:07.960> one<00:05:08.350> to<00:05:08.530> ten

00:05:08.730 --> 00:05:08.740 
again you can see on my one to ten

00:05:08.740 --> 00:05:11.670 
again you can see on my one to ten
rating<00:05:09.160> scale<00:05:09.430> you<00:05:10.270> can<00:05:10.450> see<00:05:10.480> how<00:05:10.870> value<00:05:11.410> is<00:05:11.530> it

00:05:11.670 --> 00:05:11.680 
rating scale you can see how value is it

00:05:11.680 --> 00:05:14.490 
rating scale you can see how value is it
kind<00:05:11.860> of<00:05:11.950> been<00:05:12.040> stagnant<00:05:12.810> kind<00:05:13.810> of<00:05:13.930> in<00:05:14.050> the<00:05:14.170> six

00:05:14.490 --> 00:05:14.500 
kind of been stagnant kind of in the six

00:05:14.500 --> 00:05:15.900 
kind of been stagnant kind of in the six
range<00:05:14.800> which<00:05:15.190> is<00:05:15.220> kind<00:05:15.610> of<00:05:15.640> what<00:05:15.790> I<00:05:15.820> consider

00:05:15.900 --> 00:05:15.910 
range which is kind of what I consider

00:05:15.910 --> 00:05:18.180 
range which is kind of what I consider
average<00:05:16.570> used<00:05:17.020> equipment<00:05:17.320> values<00:05:17.770> for<00:05:17.980> a<00:05:18.010> long

00:05:18.180 --> 00:05:18.190 
average used equipment values for a long

00:05:18.190 --> 00:05:21.050 
average used equipment values for a long
time<00:05:18.490> here<00:05:18.730> basically<00:05:18.940> going<00:05:19.750> back<00:05:19.930> to<00:05:20.080> 2000

00:05:21.050 --> 00:05:21.060 
time here basically going back to 2000

00:05:21.060 --> 00:05:24.300 
time here basically going back to 2000
before<00:05:22.060> 2007<00:05:23.050> not<00:05:23.200> much<00:05:23.380> happening<00:05:23.860> but<00:05:24.100> then

00:05:24.300 --> 00:05:24.310 
before 2007 not much happening but then

00:05:24.310 --> 00:05:27.870 
before 2007 not much happening but then
we<00:05:25.240> came<00:05:25.390> to<00:05:25.560> 2011<00:05:26.560> and<00:05:26.590> used<00:05:27.130> values<00:05:27.580> on<00:05:27.760> these

00:05:27.870 --> 00:05:27.880 
we came to 2011 and used values on these

00:05:27.880 --> 00:05:29.840 
we came to 2011 and used values on these
smaller<00:05:28.240> horse<00:05:28.570> tractor<00:05:29.020> starting<00:05:29.380> to<00:05:29.500> rise

00:05:29.840 --> 00:05:29.850 
smaller horse tractor starting to rise

00:05:29.850 --> 00:05:33.570 
smaller horse tractor starting to rise
so<00:05:30.850> that's<00:05:31.150> kind<00:05:31.630> of<00:05:31.750> what<00:05:32.280> you<00:05:33.280> know<00:05:33.400> what
