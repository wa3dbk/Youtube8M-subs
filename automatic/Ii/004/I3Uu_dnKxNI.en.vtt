00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.120
 hello everyone today i finished so i don't 

00:00:04.110 --> 00:00:14.429
 I can show you how I estimate but god 

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:16.470
 This is the next video so it can still 

00:00:14.429 --> 00:00:17.779
 next week just not there 

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:21.080
 Chinaris Shaft 

00:00:17.779 --> 00:00:23.550
 it consists of two halves then this 

00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:27.210
 now it just lies here 

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:33.270
 part of it is made for easy disassembly 

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:39.870
 for storage and 2 brought this here it is 

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:43.980
 made of two pipes can still be made 

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:47.550
 from one pipe I make from two since 

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:53.820
 me he will auto pick you up 

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:55.620
 I cannot therefore wheel in here as 

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:57.930
 amar corre and that is, it is here 

00:00:55.620 --> 00:01:01.730
 the distance is calculated so that one 

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:04.379
 here to introduce the second wheel 

00:01:01.730 --> 00:01:06.770
 this car will go up at an angle 

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:11.369
 somewhere will stand like this 

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:17.400
 lift the wheels that is, it stands on 

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:21.390
 the wheels can also be two pipes under 

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:24.750
 the threshold also understood the principle is very convenient 

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:28.290
 You can also this part of the front 

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:29.070
 set for lifting is permissible for under 

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:31.619
 key jack 

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:35.970
 Well, the same principle if you need ass 

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:38.689
 raise for cooking too well everything 

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:42.360
 successful operation means connected to it 

00:01:38.689 --> 00:01:45.420
 all this part comes in here it is so 

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:47.490
 puts on muscles here to steam 

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:50.340
 fixed here this thrust in order 

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:52.210
 suffer show all so here he 

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:54.960
 looks like 

00:01:52.210 --> 00:01:54.960
 assembled 

00:01:59.159 --> 00:02:07.560
 this 

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:11.310
 ear for it clings hook day winch 

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:25.440
 for this second well, and then we raise 

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:30.150
 It means to raise it with us. 

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:36.030
 lifted up a little bit here this craving I did not 

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:48.530
 Took 10 places will be a pin with us here 

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:54.120
 inserted and holds to this part 

00:02:48.530 --> 00:02:59.730
 did not slip off while lifting lift 

00:02:54.120 --> 00:03:02.700
 it is still possible above the new one 

00:02:59.730 --> 00:03:04.610
 raised leave enough i think for 

00:03:02.700 --> 00:03:08.310
 in order to understand the working principle 

00:03:04.610 --> 00:03:09.769
 enough and this pipe is of course plump 

00:03:08.310 --> 00:03:13.709
 and 

00:03:09.769 --> 00:03:17.790
 these pipes can maza pancake 

00:03:13.709 --> 00:03:19.260
 overturns us to jump you and even in 

00:03:17.790 --> 00:03:23.489
 twice what you can do 

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:26.100
 stays on earth here with us and the forest 

00:03:23.489 --> 00:03:29.700
 just of course here you can 

00:03:26.100 --> 00:03:34.349
 put the pipe into the pipe then insert 

00:03:29.700 --> 00:03:36.480
 extend the sent group here let's say 

00:03:34.349 --> 00:03:39.900
 This is how it should be 

00:03:36.480 --> 00:03:42.480
 mount for her and here is this urban she 

00:03:39.900 --> 00:03:44.970
 of course longer should be enough to 

00:03:42.480 --> 00:03:48.299
 front to rear wheel to 

00:03:44.970 --> 00:03:50.459
 stop them this is the case 

00:03:48.299 --> 00:03:55.319
 if you're going to lift this 

00:03:50.459 --> 00:03:56.819
 let's say parts over the threshold there or under 

00:03:55.319 --> 00:03:59.569
 jack nick on it 

00:03:56.819 --> 00:04:01.079
 it is this pipe that will be 

00:03:59.569 --> 00:04:02.880
 held auto 

00:04:01.079 --> 00:04:06.450
 front wheels and rear from 

00:04:02.880 --> 00:04:09.299
 slipping here I think everything is in principle 

00:04:06.450 --> 00:04:10.889
 I understand why there is no complicated construction 

00:04:09.299 --> 00:04:12.270
 very simple everything is done very quickly 

00:04:10.889 --> 00:04:15.090
 also 

00:04:12.270 --> 00:04:18.470
 no problem no place for you 

00:04:15.090 --> 00:04:23.160
 told I can not raise you because 

00:04:18.470 --> 00:04:24.930
 not planning yet for the next 

00:04:23.160 --> 00:04:28.560
 a week I just started cooking everything 

00:04:24.930 --> 00:04:31.100
 shoot so show you how it works 

00:04:28.560 --> 00:04:31.100
 act 

00:04:39.100 --> 00:04:55.990
 this one is modern we omit and I am 

00:04:42.850 --> 00:05:01.420
 this case remains in place with us 

00:04:55.990 --> 00:05:04.870
 here when craving stands in its place they 

00:05:01.420 --> 00:05:06.970
 so does not lean on the car that is here 

00:05:04.870 --> 00:05:11.730
 let's say in this position but 

00:05:06.970 --> 00:05:15.790
 would hit it on the glass or on the door 

00:05:11.730 --> 00:05:19.390
 or on the hood there is this traction 

00:05:15.790 --> 00:05:22.840
 will say it is like this 

00:05:19.390 --> 00:05:26.770
 gives exactly this part and go down 

00:05:22.840 --> 00:05:30.970
 that is, keep it exactly like this when 

00:05:26.770 --> 00:05:34.810
 raising it would give so much 

00:05:30.970 --> 00:05:37.230
 how many slopes do you need for everyone until new 

00:05:34.810 --> 00:05:37.230
 meeting
