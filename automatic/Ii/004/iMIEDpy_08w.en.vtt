00:00:07.220 --> 00:00:11.429
 those who can not travel to Brazil 

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:13.860
 they do not have to be left without 

00:00:11.429 --> 00:00:16.049
 to live the World Cup that's why the 

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:18.420
 customers have taken the zofri in search of 

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:21.140
 huge televisions and with image of 

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:23.369
 very high quality or ultra high definition 

00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:25.439
 so much so that sales have 

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:28.740
 increased in proportion comparable to 

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:31.619
 Christmas increased by 200 800 percent 

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:33.360
 more and in fact at this minute by 

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:36.690
 example we brought televisions the 

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:39.630
 day the week day monday and we no longer have 

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:41.580
 stock and they come back to have 

00:00:39.630 --> 00:00:44.360
 this is this weekend because the 

00:00:41.580 --> 00:00:47.600
 sale electro smrtv visors 

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:50.060
 the madness from 200 thousand pesos 

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:51.830
 we can get a 40 TV 

00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:53.060
 inches and with a high image 

00:00:51.830 --> 00:00:54.500
 definition 

00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:56.750
 finally the TV now the 

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:59.510
 tendency to larger sizes or 

00:00:56.750 --> 00:01:01.820
 smart or smart TVs about 

00:00:59.510 --> 00:01:03.020
 46 inches the idea is to have a 

00:01:01.820 --> 00:01:04.130
 much bigger TV for the 

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:07.130
 global people who will not go to 

00:01:04.130 --> 00:01:09.020
 world 7 believes his the world cup at home 

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:12.020
 in high definition with the best image 

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:14.120
 however the most desired TVs 

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:16.130
 are the new curved models that 

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:18.470
 they allow a more real vision from all 

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:21.320
 the moment angles we could only 

00:01:18.470 --> 00:01:23.540
 find it in a local zofri by the 

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:27.140
 moment would be the curved oled that makes us 

00:01:23.540 --> 00:01:29.630
 get basically by its curved design 

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:33.380
 that does not lose the edges anymore 

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:35.600
 and in the sense of the moment of seeing 3d 

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:37.369
 a feeling of greater depth and 

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:38.960
 basically the television has the 

00:01:37.369 --> 00:01:41.899
 particularity that does not occupy a panel 

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:43.880
 backlit so we can therefore 

00:01:41.899 --> 00:01:45.500
 each pixel determine its own color already 

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:46.940
 can go from an absolute black to a 

00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:48.830
 brighter white 

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:50.010
 apart the television gives you the possibility 

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:52.620
 of 

00:01:50.010 --> 00:01:55.290
 have four colorful beds with only 

00:01:52.620 --> 00:01:57.780
 4.3 millimeters thick is the 

00:01:55.290 --> 00:02:01.200
 the thinnest TV in the market and 

00:01:57.780 --> 00:02:04.230
 it can be ours for three million 399 

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:06.720
 thousand pesos at the end of the week can be 

00:02:04.230 --> 00:02:08.580
 find in more local moll the 

00:02:06.720 --> 00:02:11.880

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:14.520

00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:16.410

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:21.810

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:23.790

 but if they are going to start reaching the 

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:31.020
 movies with the 4k image but one 

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:32.550
 image with higher higher resolution 

00:02:31.020 --> 00:02:34.560
 pixel ag that you notice much more the 

00:02:32.550 --> 00:02:37.530
