00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.870
 hi friends from youtube I'm from maraca 

00:00:02.159 --> 00:00:08.839
 game and I bring you a little analysis 

00:00:03.870 --> 00:00:08.839
 of the new trailer of gta 5 and 18 

00:00:09.670 --> 00:00:12.690
 one to one 

00:00:14.550 --> 00:00:17.630
 sooner 

00:00:18.190 --> 00:00:22.180
 first how can we see the house of 

00:00:20.260 --> 00:00:24.130
 michael will be very luxurious as we already 

00:00:22.180 --> 00:00:26.470
 they had taught in photos and in both 

00:00:24.130 --> 00:00:28.660
 previous trailers and your car will be the 

00:00:26.470 --> 00:00:32.040
 sentinel a car that came out in almost 

00:00:28.660 --> 00:00:32.040
 all previous gt 

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:40.340
 Y 

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:53.490
 it was speculated that we would have new 

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:56.040
 sports such as golf or tennis 

00:00:53.490 --> 00:00:58.640
 thanks to this piece of the trailer we can 

00:00:56.040 --> 00:00:58.640
 affirm it 

00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:23.000
 as I said before the golf would be 

00:01:20.930 --> 00:01:25.040
 present in the game as a mini game 

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:27.460
 which we can play in any 

00:01:25.040 --> 00:01:27.460
 moment 

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:41.360
 here we can appreciate a weapon with 

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:45.729
 remote control ammunition that sincerely 

00:01:41.360 --> 00:01:45.729
 it was time to change the weapons of the gta 

00:01:49.360 --> 00:01:55.530
 so do not have a press 

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:55.530
 brady 

00:01:56.850 --> 00:02:00.360
 baby gaga 

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:06.200
 and here the michael trailer now 

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:06.200
 touch the franklin 

00:02:09.460 --> 00:02:12.930
 peggy 18 

00:02:22.069 --> 00:02:27.349
 here we can see how franklin hits 

00:02:24.469 --> 00:02:29.150
 someone with the butt of his gun this 

00:02:27.349 --> 00:02:32.439
 it will be a blow or it will only come out 

00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:32.439
 in some cinematics 

00:02:37.659 --> 00:02:42.230
 This is the part that most disturbs me 

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:45.530
 because as we already knew, the 

00:02:42.230 --> 00:02:47.510
 gang fights but this man seems 

00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:49.579
 a member of the fence the rival gang 

00:02:47.510 --> 00:02:53.500
 of gta san andreas and on his shirt 

00:02:49.579 --> 00:02:53.500
 the initials of san andreas 

00:02:55.540 --> 00:03:00.260
 How it had to be, the races are back 

00:02:58.189 --> 00:03:03.970
 street but the police do not tell us 

00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:03.970
 It will make it easy as we will see now 

00:03:11.350 --> 00:03:16.610
 and without hesitation the prostitutes are in 

00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:19.360
 all the gta but these are good 

00:03:16.610 --> 00:03:19.360
 true xd 

00:03:24.170 --> 00:03:29.550
 and as we can see in the shotgun there 

00:03:27.360 --> 00:03:31.560
 a built-in flashlight because as 

00:03:29.550 --> 00:03:34.380
 they said in gta 5 we can customize 

00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:36.480
 our weapons plus the effect of 

00:03:34.380 --> 00:03:39.230
 Splattered with blood on the wall gives a 

00:03:36.480 --> 00:03:39.230
 touch of realism 

00:03:41.740 --> 00:03:46.920
 they play west the mirror and both 

00:03:54.840 --> 00:03:59.300
 Monsignor JosÃ© Santo 

00:04:03.490 --> 00:04:09.840
 and finally now play the trailer for 

00:04:05.980 --> 00:04:09.840
 trevor pegi 18 

00:04:14.300 --> 00:04:17.300
 Y 

00:04:18.109 --> 00:04:22.979
 I do not know what you think but I think 

00:04:21.150 --> 00:04:27.289
 this answers the question of whether 

00:04:22.979 --> 00:04:27.289
 we can go without shirt in gta 5 

00:04:30.149 --> 00:04:33.149
 i 

00:04:35.610 --> 00:04:40.810
 in this part we can appreciate two things 

00:04:38.590 --> 00:04:42.969
 the first a plane that was already in 

00:04:40.810 --> 00:04:46.020
 gta san andreas and the other grandiose 

00:04:42.969 --> 00:04:46.020
 map extension 

00:04:47.219 --> 00:04:53.270
 here you can not see much but 

00:04:50.050 --> 00:04:56.270
 I'm sure that hurts 

00:04:53.270 --> 00:04:56.270
 learn 

00:05:00.750 --> 00:05:06.050
 they have made me of the word 

00:05:09.630 --> 00:05:12.470
 at night 

00:05:14.790 --> 00:05:18.840
 in this part we can see trevor 

00:05:16.800 --> 00:05:21.090
 jump on top of a moving plane 

00:05:18.840 --> 00:05:23.969
 in a scene of chaos I hope that 

00:05:21.090 --> 00:05:26.989
 can be done when we want 

00:05:23.969 --> 00:05:26.989
 well, friend 

00:05:28.729 --> 00:05:32.930
 and finally here we can observe a 

00:05:30.919 --> 00:05:34.789
 car crashing into a train and the 

00:05:32.930 --> 00:05:36.990
 way in which the car is destroyed is 

00:05:34.789 --> 00:05:39.740
 very realistic 

00:05:36.990 --> 00:05:39.740
 rock 

00:05:44.420 --> 00:05:47.260
 they do not see it 

00:05:57.440 --> 00:06:00.440
 Y
