00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.040
 Existential riddles 

00:00:01.220 --> 00:00:04.340
 Did you ask yourself not by chance 

00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:06.400
 Who am I? 

00:00:06.880 --> 00:00:09.740
 "Does the human soul exist in reality? " 

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:14.080
 "What is the power of the mind? " 

00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:17.980
 "What is the astral body? " 

00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:22.020
 "What is the purpose of my existence? " 

00:00:23.420 --> 00:00:27.320
 In reality we are only a body in flesh and bone; 

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:30.200
 the physical body is only 

00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:35.120
 the expression vehicle of higher energies 

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:38.860
 that manifest themselves throughout life. 

00:00:39.060 --> 00:00:43.300
 Let's put an example of a candle or electric bulb 

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:49.780
 through which the electrical energy transformed into light is expressed. 

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:56.520
 The soul is a wonderful energy composed of virtues 

00:00:56.900 --> 00:01:00.000
 that ennoble all people. 

00:01:00.400 --> 00:01:03.440
 Extraordinary psychic powers 

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:06.960
 and the consciousness that allows us to know 

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:10.580
 all the good we can do in life 

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:14.640
 life and at the same time warns us not to continue to make mistakes. 

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:18.120
 Fully developed consciousness, 

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:24.460
 helps us to know our outer and inner universe 

00:01:25.220 --> 00:01:31.180
 And the knowledge of the mysteries of life and death, and God. 

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:35.800
 The power of mental strength is manifested in people 

00:01:35.800 --> 00:01:40.660
 that some philosophical schools call "mental body" 

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:46.120
 the one that allows us to plan and organize any intellectual activity 

00:01:46.120 --> 00:01:53.000
 It is one of the most powerful energies that exist in creation. 

00:01:53.320 --> 00:01:56.860
 All that exists in the world is only condensed mind. 

00:01:57.100 --> 00:02:01.740
 It is said that the universe existed first in the mind of the Creator, 

00:02:02.140 --> 00:02:07.840
 then he became a reality with the magic of the Word of the Almighty. 

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:10.860
 We are what we think. 

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:15.600
 If we want to have a happy and healthy life, 

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:20.140
 we must change the way we think about the positive pole. 

00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:24.380
 There are people who use the power of the spirit to heal, 

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:33.120
 others to invent machines, ships and all kinds of enterprises for the good of humanity. 

00:02:33.320 --> 00:02:39.440
 But on the other hand, there are also people who use the spirit to harm themselves and others. 

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:44.740
 The spirit was symbolized by ancient scholars by a donkey. 

00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:50.100
 because he sometimes behaves like a donkey. 

00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:53.780
 Recall the fable of the "Assess of Apuleius". 

00:02:54.160 --> 00:03:00.840
 Also, in the Christ Drama, the Grand Master of Masters Jesus Christ, 

00:03:01.100 --> 00:03:04.640
 entered Jerusalem mounted on a donkey 

00:03:04.960 --> 00:03:07.840
 and he was acclaimed by the multitudes. 

00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:10.680
 The teaching that the Grand Master gave to humanity was: 

00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:15.960
 "I am the master and lord of my spirit and he serves all my purposes" 

00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:19.540
 In truth, the vast majority of human beings 

00:03:19.540 --> 00:03:22.940
 wear this donkey on his shoulders. 

00:03:23.240 --> 00:03:30.180
 The mind needs a direction that could turn it into an extraordinary tool. 

00:03:30.740 --> 00:03:35.480
 This direction would be in the account of our soul. 

00:03:35.820 --> 00:03:41.340
 That's why when we are immersed in our problems, 

00:03:41.720 --> 00:03:46.080
 Spiritual guides recommend us to meditate. 

00:03:46.760 --> 00:03:58.040
 Meditation requires a good relaxation, followed by a state of mental tranquility and prayer to the gods. 

00:03:58.540 --> 00:04:06.760
 In the absence of mental contradictions, reality arises, and consciousness or soul gives us innovative ideas. 

00:04:07.020 --> 00:04:12.820
 We invite you to watch our video on Mental Relaxation and Relaxation to activate the coronary and mental chakra. 

00:04:13.120 --> 00:04:18.660
 The astral body is energetic and governs our emotions. 

00:04:18.960 --> 00:04:25.540
 It is a vehicle of the soul and also, negative values ​​that are the cause of our mistakes 

00:04:25.880 --> 00:04:28.080
 and suffering in life. 

00:04:28.240 --> 00:04:29.960
 These negative values ​​are: 

00:04:29.960 --> 00:04:37.720
 anger, laziness, pride, lust, hypocrisy, envy, among others ... 

00:04:37.720 --> 00:04:40.780
 If we learn to self-know ourselves, 

00:04:41.200 --> 00:04:45.740
 we can create the changes needed to live in harmony. 

00:04:46.220 --> 00:04:52.960
 After the death of the material body, the soul collects its positive and negative values. 

00:04:53.080 --> 00:04:57.260
 Then, she is subject to a judgment before Heavenly Justice, 

00:04:57.600 --> 00:05:04.000
 in which one determines, according to his good or bad works, his fate, 

00:05:04.460 --> 00:05:09.560
 and also, in what time and in what circumstances she will have to return 

00:05:09.814 --> 00:05:15.614
 in a new body to this material world to continue his learning or spiritual evolution. 

00:05:16.380 --> 00:05:20.900
