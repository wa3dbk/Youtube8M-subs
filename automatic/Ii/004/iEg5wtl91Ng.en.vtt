00:00:09.430 --> 00:00:11.970 

I<00:00:09.460> think<00:00:10.450> I'd<00:00:10.630> been<00:00:10.840> interested<00:00:11.110> in<00:00:11.650> writing

00:00:11.970 --> 00:00:11.980 
I think I'd been interested in writing

00:00:11.980 --> 00:00:14.580 
I think I'd been interested in writing
since<00:00:12.639> I<00:00:12.969> don't<00:00:13.210> know<00:00:13.299> I<00:00:13.540> was<00:00:13.690> 12<00:00:14.020> or<00:00:14.230> whatever

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:14.590 
since I don't know I was 12 or whatever

00:00:14.590 --> 00:00:18.140 
since I don't know I was 12 or whatever
I've<00:00:14.980> always<00:00:15.760> kept<00:00:16.090> journals<00:00:17.130> certainly

00:00:18.140 --> 00:00:18.150 
I've always kept journals certainly

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:22.620 
I've always kept journals certainly
steadily<00:00:19.150> for<00:00:19.360> the<00:00:19.420> last<00:00:19.599> 60<00:00:20.080> years<00:00:20.460> I<00:00:21.630> didn't

00:00:22.620 --> 00:00:22.630 
steadily for the last 60 years I didn't

00:00:22.630 --> 00:00:25.800 
steadily for the last 60 years I didn't
know<00:00:22.750> how<00:00:23.110> the<00:00:23.640> writing<00:00:24.640> and<00:00:24.939> science<00:00:25.630> and

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:25.810 
know how the writing and science and

00:00:25.810 --> 00:00:28.019 
know how the writing and science and
medicine<00:00:26.079> could<00:00:26.860> come<00:00:27.099> together<00:00:27.279> or<00:00:27.790> if<00:00:27.880> they

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:28.029 
medicine could come together or if they

00:00:28.029 --> 00:00:30.120 
medicine could come together or if they
would<00:00:28.180> ever<00:00:28.210> come<00:00:28.630> together<00:00:28.840> but<00:00:29.739> they<00:00:29.919> did

00:00:30.120 --> 00:00:30.130 
would ever come together but they did

00:00:30.130 --> 00:00:32.760 
would ever come together but they did
seem<00:00:30.430> to<00:00:30.460> come<00:00:30.759> together<00:00:30.910> in<00:00:31.599> the<00:00:32.259> stories<00:00:32.739> of

00:00:32.760 --> 00:00:32.770 
seem to come together in the stories of

00:00:32.770 --> 00:00:37.830 
seem to come together in the stories of
patients<00:00:33.130> and<00:00:33.640> case<00:00:33.850> histories<00:00:33.880> and<00:00:35.370> I<00:00:36.450> I<00:00:37.450> had

00:00:37.830 --> 00:00:37.840 
patients and case histories and I I had

00:00:37.840 --> 00:00:39.810 
patients and case histories and I I had
an<00:00:37.930> effect<00:00:38.200> written<00:00:38.680> my<00:00:38.950> first<00:00:38.980> book<00:00:39.610> on

00:00:39.810 --> 00:00:39.820 
an effect written my first book on

00:00:39.820 --> 00:00:42.770 
an effect written my first book on
migraine<00:00:40.780> before<00:00:41.710> I<00:00:41.739> encountered<00:00:42.550> these

00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:42.780 
migraine before I encountered these

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:47.290 
migraine before I encountered these
patients<00:00:43.780> at<00:00:43.899> Beth<00:00:44.050> Abraham

00:00:47.290 --> 00:00:47.300 

00:00:47.300 --> 00:00:50.729 

I<00:00:48.399> would<00:00:49.399> recommend<00:00:49.969> keeping<00:00:50.210> a<00:00:50.510> journal

00:00:50.729 --> 00:00:50.739 
I would recommend keeping a journal

00:00:50.739 --> 00:00:53.200 
I would recommend keeping a journal
period<00:00:51.739> I<00:00:52.010> hadn't<00:00:52.790> thought<00:00:52.970> of<00:00:53.030> it

00:00:53.200 --> 00:00:53.210 
period I hadn't thought of it

00:00:53.210 --> 00:00:55.479 
period I hadn't thought of it
particularly<00:00:53.780> as<00:00:53.930> a<00:00:54.079> happiness<00:00:54.680> producing

00:00:55.479 --> 00:00:55.489 
particularly as a happiness producing

00:00:55.489 --> 00:00:59.830 
particularly as a happiness producing
device<00:00:55.850> I<00:00:56.180> mean<00:00:56.809> I<00:00:56.930> think<00:00:56.989> for<00:00:57.260> myself<00:00:58.840> there's

00:00:59.830 --> 00:00:59.840 
device I mean I think for myself there's

00:00:59.840 --> 00:01:02.170 
device I mean I think for myself there's
always<00:01:00.170> been<00:01:00.530> a<00:01:00.559> need<00:01:00.890> to<00:01:01.340> make<00:01:01.579> some<00:01:01.850> sort<00:01:02.030> of

00:01:02.170 --> 00:01:02.180 
always been a need to make some sort of

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:04.930 
always been a need to make some sort of
narrative<00:01:03.019> sense<00:01:03.470> and<00:01:03.860> to<00:01:04.009> describe<00:01:04.580> people

00:01:04.930 --> 00:01:04.940 
narrative sense and to describe people

00:01:04.940 --> 00:01:08.050 
narrative sense and to describe people
and<00:01:05.659> events<00:01:06.110> and<00:01:06.290> situations<00:01:06.650> and<00:01:07.490> feelings

00:01:08.050 --> 00:01:08.060 
and events and situations and feelings

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:13.840 
and events and situations and feelings
and<00:01:10.180> and<00:01:11.180> I<00:01:11.570> need<00:01:11.990> to<00:01:12.229> keep<00:01:12.440> a<00:01:12.560> journal<00:01:12.850> partly

00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:13.850 
and and I need to keep a journal partly

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:16.930 
and and I need to keep a journal partly
as<00:01:14.000> a<00:01:14.030> as<00:01:14.570> an<00:01:14.720> act<00:01:14.930> of<00:01:15.140> clarification<00:01:16.100> partly

00:01:16.930 --> 00:01:16.940 
as a as an act of clarification partly

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:19.510 
as a as an act of clarification partly
also<00:01:17.119> because<00:01:17.330> it<00:01:17.720> allows<00:01:18.409> my<00:01:18.710> imagination

00:01:19.510 --> 00:01:19.520 
also because it allows my imagination

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:21.430 
also because it allows my imagination
and<00:01:19.640> fantasy<00:01:19.850> free<00:01:20.840> reign

00:01:21.430 --> 00:01:21.440 
and fantasy free reign

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:24.100 
and fantasy free reign
but<00:01:21.770> somehow<00:01:22.070> held<00:01:22.910> held<00:01:23.300> within<00:01:23.630> a<00:01:23.840> sort<00:01:24.050> of

00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:24.110 
but somehow held held within a sort of

00:01:24.110 --> 00:01:28.210 
but somehow held held within a sort of
framework<00:01:24.460> but<00:01:25.460> I<00:01:25.670> just<00:01:26.330> I<00:01:26.509> hugely<00:01:27.170> enjoy<00:01:27.649> the

00:01:28.210 --> 00:01:28.220 
framework but I just I hugely enjoy the

00:01:28.220 --> 00:01:30.999 
framework but I just I hugely enjoy the
act<00:01:28.399> of<00:01:28.640> writing<00:01:28.880> and<00:01:29.360> I<00:01:30.259> find<00:01:30.590> it<00:01:30.710> absolutely

00:01:30.999 --> 00:01:31.009 
act of writing and I find it absolutely

00:01:31.009 --> 00:01:36.040 
act of writing and I find it absolutely
necessary<00:01:32.200> and<00:01:33.520> I<00:01:34.520> am<00:01:34.820> whether<00:01:35.630> it's<00:01:35.840> keeping

00:01:36.040 --> 00:01:36.050 
necessary and I am whether it's keeping

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:39.010 
necessary and I am whether it's keeping
a<00:01:36.350> journal<00:01:36.560> or<00:01:37.030> any<00:01:38.030> other<00:01:38.270> sort<00:01:38.600> of<00:01:38.780> writing

00:01:39.010 --> 00:01:39.020 
a journal or any other sort of writing

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:41.980 
a journal or any other sort of writing
I'm<00:01:39.500> certainly<00:01:40.190> unhappy<00:01:40.850> when<00:01:41.360> I<00:01:41.390> can't<00:01:41.750> like

00:01:41.980 --> 00:01:41.990 
I'm certainly unhappy when I can't like

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:45.790 
I'm certainly unhappy when I can't like
so<00:01:42.380> for<00:01:42.649> me<00:01:43.119> writing<00:01:44.119> is<00:01:44.390> a<00:01:44.420> central<00:01:44.960> form<00:01:45.560> of

00:01:45.790 --> 00:01:45.800 
so for me writing is a central form of

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:51.639 
so for me writing is a central form of
of<00:01:47.170> of<00:01:48.170> happiness<00:01:49.570> not<00:01:50.570> specifically<00:01:51.170> keeping

00:01:51.639 --> 00:01:51.649 
of of happiness not specifically keeping

00:01:51.649 --> 00:01:53.919 
of of happiness not specifically keeping
a<00:01:51.739> journal<00:01:51.890> but<00:01:52.789> for<00:01:53.060> someone<00:01:53.360> else<00:01:53.509> that<00:01:53.720> may

00:01:53.919 --> 00:01:53.929 
a journal but for someone else that may

00:01:53.929 --> 00:01:57.999 
a journal but for someone else that may
be<00:01:53.989> sort<00:01:54.530> of<00:01:55.840> 'men<00:01:56.840> I<00:01:56.929> think<00:01:57.200> I<00:01:57.349> think<00:01:57.590> anything
