00:00:15.340 --> 00:00:17.820
 yes 

00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:21.890
 and I relive the hair in an adventure where 

00:00:20.210 --> 00:00:24.220
 everything is created as if it were 

00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:26.779
 plasticine and I saw that the rainbow brush 

00:00:24.220 --> 00:00:28.429
 if you want to know all its details and 

00:00:26.779 --> 00:00:31.269
 features you can take a look 

00:00:28.429 --> 00:00:31.269
 to our analysis 

00:00:36.370 --> 00:00:40.570
 if you take us to a peaceful day 

00:00:38.379 --> 00:00:43.449
 like any other the always animated 

00:00:40.570 --> 00:00:45.460
 civil dreamland and his friends are engaged 

00:00:43.449 --> 00:00:47.440
 to his own when suddenly man put 

00:00:45.460 --> 00:00:49.510
 returned to the mystery a portal has emerged 

00:00:47.440 --> 00:00:52.290
 to absorb all the color of oozing at 

00:00:49.510 --> 00:00:52.290
 home of kirby 

00:00:57.990 --> 00:01:01.860
 now it serves and must undertake the task of 

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:04.320
 return to dream land its beauty and 

00:01:01.860 --> 00:01:06.510
 previous glow with the help of a 

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:08.310
 magic brush known as line kirby 

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:12.110
 he jumps into the portal with a leap and 

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:12.110
 embark on another colorful adventure 

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:26.159
 its gameplay is very similar to what 

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:28.530
 seen in kill bill brush the power of 

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:30.570
 nintendo ds having to draw ropes 

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:33.149
 rainbow on the touch screen of the game 

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:35.729
 Wii pack to guide and you're aim 

00:01:33.149 --> 00:01:37.950
 these ropes allow us to make clean 

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:39.860
 avoid obstacles catapult silvio 

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:42.390
 protect it from imminent danger 

00:01:39.860 --> 00:01:43.680
 we can only draw a quantity of 

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:45.840
 rainbow strings at a time 

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:47.729
 disappearing after a while and if 

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:49.409
 our paint bar runs out 

00:01:47.729 --> 00:01:51.860
 we can trace again until it 

00:01:49.409 --> 00:01:51.860
 recharge 

00:01:57.280 --> 00:02:01.390
 not everything is to draw ropes and here it was 

00:01:59.830 --> 00:02:03.369
 and has an 'ace' of skills 

00:02:01.390 --> 00:02:06.460
 special that will help restore 

00:02:03.369 --> 00:02:08.229
 Seeing them in dreamland image thank you 

00:02:06.460 --> 00:02:10.300
 at the annular velocity we can draw 

00:02:08.229 --> 00:02:12.430
 rings that make Kirby receive a 

00:02:10.300 --> 00:02:14.170
 accelerate while with the turbo charge 

00:02:12.430 --> 00:02:16.750
 we will crush mimics and break 

00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:18.310
 blocks touching the protagonist if 

00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:20.050
 we also get 100 explains if 

00:02:18.310 --> 00:02:21.940
 we keep clicking here and we can 

00:02:20.050 --> 00:02:24.040
 perform the turbo scene with which 

00:02:21.940 --> 00:02:28.050
 destroy harder enemy blocks 

00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:28.050
 powerful or get a bigger boost 

00:02:35.950 --> 00:02:39.670
 in certain occasions to civil and touches 

00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:42.010
 transform into a series of vehicles 

00:02:39.670 --> 00:02:43.840
 to overcome obstacles using 

00:02:42.010 --> 00:02:46.480
 Rainbow rope of various shapes 

00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:47.890
 according to the transformation to kirby rocket 

00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:49.629
 we guide him by rope 

00:02:47.890 --> 00:02:51.610
 going through everything that is in 

00:02:49.629 --> 00:02:54.430
 your way and gaining momentum when going through 

00:02:51.610 --> 00:02:56.260
 the hoops with kirby so we move forward 

00:02:54.430 --> 00:02:58.150
 slowly down the path we draw 

00:02:56.260 --> 00:03:00.250
 if it shoots the place that we point out 

00:02:58.150 --> 00:03:03.160
 being able to launch a great burst of 

00:03:00.250 --> 00:03:05.140
 rockets when you get the 100 coins for 

00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:06.970
 last we have a submarine derby that 

00:03:05.140 --> 00:03:08.860
 it crosses the waters going to the 

00:03:06.970 --> 00:03:12.599
 point we touch guiding your missiles 

00:03:08.860 --> 00:03:12.599
 through the rainbow forces 

00:03:21.790 --> 00:03:25.810
 from time to time we find scattered 

00:03:23.829 --> 00:03:27.280
 for the main mode small challenges 

00:03:25.810 --> 00:03:29.280
 where we have to get the 

00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:32.049
 treasure before time runs out 

00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:34.060
 once unlocked we can play them 

00:03:32.049 --> 00:03:35.650
 as many times as we want in challenges 

00:03:34.060 --> 00:03:37.689
 to try to achieve the best 

00:03:35.650 --> 00:03:40.269
 possible score finding a total 

00:03:37.689 --> 00:03:43.739
 of 48 and each of them having a 

00:03:40.269 --> 00:03:43.739
 15 seconds duration 

00:03:48.990 --> 00:03:52.620
 each level has a series of 

00:03:50.970 --> 00:03:54.420
 treasure chests hidden by the 

00:03:52.620 --> 00:03:57.300
 scenarios being the biggest challenge of the 

00:03:54.420 --> 00:03:58.920
 game find them all can be in 

00:03:57.300 --> 00:04:01.170
 areas where you have to activate certain 

00:03:58.920 --> 00:04:02.880
 objects when traversing an area in color to 

00:04:01.170 --> 00:04:05.040
 in which we can play our door or 

00:04:02.880 --> 00:04:08.010
 when collecting all the pieces of a puzzle 

00:04:05.040 --> 00:04:09.870
 among many others these treasures we 

00:04:08.010 --> 00:04:11.940
 allow you to get different extras 

00:04:09.870 --> 00:04:14.400
 as plasticine figures of various 

00:04:11.940 --> 00:04:16.080
 characters and objects of the game music of 

00:04:14.400 --> 00:04:18.270
 previous installments of the saga and 

00:04:16.080 --> 00:04:20.970
 current game finding the all in the 

00:04:18.270 --> 00:04:22.890
 music saga at the end of each level 

00:04:20.970 --> 00:04:24.690
 we can also get pages from 

00:04:22.890 --> 00:04:28.580
 secret diary to know the history 

00:04:24.690 --> 00:04:28.580
 and more in depth characters 

00:04:34.300 --> 00:04:37.840
 There is also the challenge of getting 

00:04:36.490 --> 00:04:39.970
 Gold score for each level 

00:04:37.840 --> 00:04:42.960
 trying to get the most number of 

00:04:39.970 --> 00:04:42.960
 possible stars 

00:04:46.980 --> 00:04:50.880
 they could not miss the bosses being 

00:04:49.080 --> 00:04:52.680
 challenging and very eye-catching to see 

00:04:50.880 --> 00:04:54.720
 although it is a pity that they are quite 

00:04:52.680 --> 00:04:57.060
 scarce and repeated with the passage of 

00:04:54.720 --> 00:04:59.780
 phases increasing their difficulty a little 

00:04:57.060 --> 00:04:59.780
 of in each encounter 

00:05:03.610 --> 00:05:07.810
 the game includes a multiplayer mode 

00:05:05.439 --> 00:05:09.069
 for up to four players facing 

00:05:07.810 --> 00:05:11.770
 the adventure all together 

00:05:09.069 --> 00:05:13.300
 cooperatively only the player with the 

00:05:11.770 --> 00:05:15.729
 will you gameplay handles that and 

00:05:13.300 --> 00:05:18.009
 drawing rainbow strings embodying 

00:05:15.729 --> 00:05:20.080
 the rest of participants water the ts in 

00:05:18.009 --> 00:05:21.520
 any time either with the command of 

00:05:20.080 --> 00:05:23.979
 wii ware probe with you ' 

00:05:21.520 --> 00:05:26.259
 uader disk can travel ropes 

00:05:23.979 --> 00:05:28.360
 bow and bless collect objects attack with 

00:05:26.259 --> 00:05:30.460
 their spears and lend a hand to civilians 

00:05:28.360 --> 00:05:32.289
 being responsible for detaining 

00:05:30.460 --> 00:05:34.120
 they take and you're trying to throw the 

00:05:32.289 --> 00:05:36.659
 glove to kirk and they only appear in 

00:05:34.120 --> 00:05:36.659
 this modality 

00:05:40.210 --> 00:05:44.590
 the live figures also have their 

00:05:42.610 --> 00:05:46.720
 function in this game unlocking a 

00:05:44.590 --> 00:05:49.569
 enhancer each of the compatible 

00:05:46.720 --> 00:05:51.729
 once a day and on a single level with 

00:05:49.569 --> 00:05:53.229
 Kirby's friend we can use a turbo 

00:05:51.729 --> 00:05:55.240
 stellar at any time without 

00:05:53.229 --> 00:05:57.940
 need to gather the 100 stars of 

00:05:55.240 --> 00:05:59.860
 points king dedede places a crown 15 and 

00:05:57.940 --> 00:06:01.840
 provides you with 6 health bars in 

00:05:59.860 --> 00:06:03.639
 place of the usual four and goal 

00:06:01.840 --> 00:06:06.720
 knight gives him his famous mask for 

00:06:03.639 --> 00:06:06.720
 boost your turbo 

00:06:09.260 --> 00:06:13.010
 graphically it is very striking with 

00:06:11.270 --> 00:06:15.050
 Colorful plasticine designs and 

00:06:13.010 --> 00:06:17.150
 characters very well animated although one 

00:06:15.050 --> 00:06:18.860
 Once we are used to the fact that we do not know 

00:06:17.150 --> 00:06:21.430
 used to full advantage of such 

00:06:18.860 --> 00:06:21.430
 texture 

00:06:23.120 --> 00:06:26.810
 his soundtrack is still so good 

00:06:25.340 --> 00:06:28.150
 as in the rest of deliveries of the 

00:06:26.810 --> 00:06:30.380
 There will be with known topics 

00:06:28.150 --> 00:06:33.139
 reinterpreted and others completely 

00:06:30.380 --> 00:06:36.280
 new sound effects too 

00:06:33.139 --> 00:06:36.280
 They are very achieved 

00:06:37.540 --> 00:06:42.130
 in conclusion that I saw the rainbow is a 

00:06:40.300 --> 00:06:44.170
 platforms whose gameplay is very 

00:06:42.130 --> 00:06:46.690
 entertaining but we miss something 

00:06:44.170 --> 00:06:48.040
 more variety in their development the 

00:06:46.690 --> 00:06:49.810
 treasures and the large amount of 

00:06:48.040 --> 00:06:51.640
 collectibles to get make the 

00:06:49.810 --> 00:06:53.650
 adventure gain some difficulty and 

00:06:51.640 --> 00:06:56.230
 duration being a pretty title 

00:06:53.650 --> 00:06:58.720
 simple highlights especially its fun 

00:06:56.230 --> 00:07:00.670
 cooperative multiplayer the utility of 

00:06:58.720 --> 00:07:03.780
 the friend figures in this game we 

00:07:00.670 --> 00:07:03.780
 it seems to be good 

00:07:08.940 --> 00:07:12.810
 the design of the characters and the 

00:07:10.860 --> 00:07:15.540
 scenarios are very good although it is cast 

00:07:12.810 --> 00:07:17.370
 in lack more variety the melodies like 

00:07:15.540 --> 00:07:20.990
 always enjoy a high quality at 

00:07:17.370 --> 00:07:20.990
 just like its sound effects 

00:07:25.729 --> 00:07:29.719
 Kirby and the good of the rainbow surprises 

00:07:27.949 --> 00:07:31.759
 for his successful designs being a 

00:07:29.719 --> 00:07:35.439
 very fun and entertaining title but 

00:07:31.759 --> 00:07:35.439
 improvable in small details
