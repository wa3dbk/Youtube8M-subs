00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:05.069
 welcome to the apocalypse if this 

00:00:03.090 --> 00:00:07.700
 short video was created to give you 

00:00:05.069 --> 00:00:10.500
 a glimpse of the universe is its interface 

00:00:07.700 --> 00:00:12.630
 if you decide to register yourself 

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:14.730
 will incarnate a commander of yours from 

00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:16.410
 build his character his appearance 

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:17.010
 and his behavior according to your 

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:19.020
 preference 

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:20.970
 you will be at the head of a civilization 

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:22.920
 that you will have to forget about your image 

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:24.230
 and prosper in the concert of 

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:26.400
 other galactic peoples 

00:00:24.230 --> 00:00:28.289
 I will now introduce the 

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:30.359
 main pillars of the game through a 

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:31.650
 quick preview of its interface as 

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:32.730
 you will discover it after you are 

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:33.930
 registered 

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:36.300
 I connect to my center 

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:38.550
 command we are here in 

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:39.629
 the tab strategy this tab allows to 

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:41.370
 take a look at the map 

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:43.860
 graphic around our first 

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:46.020
 planet that appears in green 1 orange 

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:46.410
 appear the planets neutral in 

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:49.079
 red 

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:50.670
 our neighbors the other commanders 

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:52.050
 from this tab we can take 

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:53.879
 knowledge of the units we 

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:56.340
 have in our galactic system 

00:00:53.879 --> 00:00:57.780
 we can give them orders we 

00:00:56.340 --> 00:00:59.370
 can for example send our shuttles 

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:01.350
 on a mission of exploration on a planet 

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:03.539
 in order to obtain information on the 

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:06.409
 population the defenses or the 

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:06.409
 resources of this planet 

00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:11.159
 we can in the same orderly way 

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:13.170
 invasions or rallies 

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:14.909
 diplomatic and many others 

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:17.509
 orders that will appear as and when 

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:19.140
 measuring our progress 

00:01:17.509 --> 00:01:21.900
 let's move on to the tab 

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:23.630
 infrastructures in this space we 

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:26.220
 can we manage our planet 

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:28.409
 these features are presented here 

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:31.380
 number of inhabitants happiness of the 

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:34.040
 population planetary defense deposits 

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:34.040
 and resource reserves 

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:37.530
 four types of resources his foal 

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:39.119
 are usable the files are the 

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:41.520
 currency of the universe produced by the 

00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:43.649
 Taxes on the trade 

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:45.590
 metals the diamonds and the energy are 

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:48.000
 resources tap into the planets 

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:49.200
 from this tab it is possible to 

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:50.939
 build buildings as per 

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:54.240
 example a metal mine so 

00:01:50.939 --> 00:01:55.560
 to improve our production we 

00:01:54.240 --> 00:02:00.590
 can also build units 

00:01:55.560 --> 00:02:00.590
 had no exploration hunters etc 

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:04.159
 let's move on to another aspect 

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:07.819
 crucial poker that 

00:02:04.159 --> 00:02:09.440
 diplomacy from the diplomacy tab 

00:02:07.819 --> 00:02:11.870
 we receive and send messages 

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:14.209
 to others how in these messages have 

00:02:11.870 --> 00:02:15.080
 called comics it looks like we have 

00:02:14.209 --> 00:02:17.060
 detected a signal 

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:19.239
 we can get in touch with the 

00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:21.290
 commander who is at the origin 

00:02:19.239 --> 00:02:23.599
 it might be interesting to organize 

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:24.500
 peacefully life in the system and 

00:02:23.599 --> 00:02:26.840
 propose a collaboration 

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:28.010
 technology or to make him believe that 

00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:31.090
 you went from our philosophy have 

00:02:28.010 --> 00:02:33.890
 showed our true face 

00:02:31.090 --> 00:02:35.989
 he will receive the committee that he will connect 

00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:39.650
 at his command center and will choose 

00:02:35.989 --> 00:02:40.970
 then to answer us or not but the 

00:02:39.650 --> 00:02:43.099
 Diplomacy is also played out in 

00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:45.860
 assemblies gathered in the tab 

00:02:43.099 --> 00:02:47.989
 following the mythical and assembled 

00:02:45.860 --> 00:02:49.790
 galactic is located on the capital of 

00:02:47.989 --> 00:02:50.470
 the galaxy it's in the hands of the 

00:02:49.790 --> 00:02:52.870
 government 

00:02:50.470 --> 00:02:55.040
 every order can be expressed 

00:02:52.870 --> 00:02:55.670
 attention it is recommended to put it 

00:02:55.040 --> 00:02:57.410
 shapes 

00:02:55.670 --> 00:03:01.040
 it is a serious place and highly 

00:02:57.410 --> 00:03:02.060
 politics as you see from 

00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:04.640
 many debates take place at the assembly 

00:03:02.060 --> 00:03:06.250
 gala which the greatest speakers have a 

00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:08.329
 diplomatic respect therefore 

00:03:06.250 --> 00:03:09.079
 represented by a score from the votes 

00:03:08.329 --> 00:03:11.420
 from the community 

00:03:09.079 --> 00:03:14.930
 this system guarantees high quality 

00:03:11.420 --> 00:03:17.060
 in published posts but reassure 

00:03:14.930 --> 00:03:18.470
 you there are also taverns that 

00:03:17.060 --> 00:03:20.660
 each commander can host on 

00:03:18.470 --> 00:03:22.069
 one of these planets and animated as good 

00:03:20.660 --> 00:03:24.500
 it seems to him after inviting others 

00:03:22.069 --> 00:03:26.630
 some commanders are markets 

00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:28.459
 galec others pointers of pirates 

00:03:26.630 --> 00:03:29.870
 others still stand out as 

00:03:28.459 --> 00:03:31.760
 real capital of sectors 

00:03:29.870 --> 00:03:35.690
 galactic or this one of politics 

00:03:31.760 --> 00:03:36.590
 local strategy management and diplomacy 

00:03:35.690 --> 00:03:38.720
 are the three important pillars 

00:03:36.590 --> 00:03:40.730
 apocalypsis for all commanders 

00:03:38.720 --> 00:03:41.870
 but since these are two commandments 

00:03:40.730 --> 00:03:44.049
 you can also manage your 

00:03:41.870 --> 00:03:45.950
 civilization 

00:03:44.049 --> 00:03:46.549
 you will be able to choose a type of 

00:03:45.950 --> 00:03:48.260
 government 

00:03:46.549 --> 00:03:49.370
 choose public policies that 

00:03:48.260 --> 00:03:51.380
 you want to see in force in 

00:03:49.370 --> 00:03:52.579
 your civilization monitor 

00:03:51.380 --> 00:03:56.450
 evolution of the indicators of 

00:03:52.579 --> 00:03:58.220
 civilization you will also be able to do 

00:03:56.450 --> 00:03:59.359
 scientific discoveries in 

00:03:58.220 --> 00:04:01.970
 financing the researchers of your 

00:03:59.359 --> 00:04:04.540
 planetary universities technology 

00:04:01.970 --> 00:04:06.620
 plays a key role in the apocalypse if 

00:04:04.540 --> 00:04:08.090
 you can finally do many 

00:04:06.620 --> 00:04:11.450
 trade with others 

00:04:08.090 --> 00:04:13.400
 commanders apocalypsis everything is bought and 

00:04:11.450 --> 00:04:15.590
 everything is sold as long as you find the 

00:04:13.400 --> 00:04:17.419
 commander interesting the planets the 

00:04:15.590 --> 00:04:18.250
 units the technologies even the shots 

00:04:17.419 --> 00:04:20.450
 low 

00:04:18.250 --> 00:04:20.959
 it is physical ends realized 

00:04:20.450 --> 00:04:22.520
 of the universe 

00:04:20.959 --> 00:04:24.440
 I hope he has convinced you 

00:04:22.520 --> 00:04:25.880
 try the experience you will not be left 

00:04:24.440 --> 00:04:29.330
 so more than choosing one of the four 

00:04:25.880 --> 00:04:31.720
 over the game federation alliance guiding 

00:04:29.330 --> 00:04:31.720
 renegades
