in<00:02:31.650> them<00:02:31.860> but<00:02:32.640> I<00:02:32.700> do<00:02:32.819> have<00:02:33.180> some<00:02:33.480> cracks

00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:33.810 
in them but I do have some cracks

00:02:33.810 --> 00:02:39.350 
in them but I do have some cracks

00:02:39.350 --> 00:02:39.360 
starting right here that's actually from

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:41.900 
starting right here that's actually from
twine<00:02:39.989> strings<00:02:40.470> on<00:02:40.709> hay<00:02:40.920> bales<00:02:41.190> moving<00:02:41.730> them

00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:41.910 
twine strings on hay bales moving them

00:02:41.910 --> 00:02:44.690 
twine strings on hay bales moving them
around<00:02:42.530> but<00:02:43.530> they're<00:02:43.800> also<00:02:43.980> a<00:02:44.160> great<00:02:44.370> hay

00:02:44.690 --> 00:02:44.700 
around but they're also a great hay

00:02:50.930 --> 00:02:50.940 
enough dexterity to dig into the hay get

00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:53.300 
enough dexterity to dig into the hay get
under<00:02:51.180> the<00:02:51.300> string<00:02:51.600> and<00:02:51.780> lift<00:02:51.989> it<00:02:52.200> up<00:02:52.380> and

00:02:53.300 --> 00:02:53.310 
under the string and lift it up and

00:02:53.310 --> 00:02:56.690 
under the string and lift it up and
carry<00:02:53.700> it<00:02:53.790> around<00:02:54.180> very<00:02:54.360> easily<00:02:54.959> and<00:02:55.700> they

00:02:56.690 --> 00:02:56.700 
carry it around very easily and they

00:02:56.700 --> 00:02:58.729 
carry it around very easily and they
breathe<00:02:57.180> so<00:02:57.959> that<00:02:58.140> you<00:02:58.260> don't<00:02:58.440> get<00:02:58.680> that

00:02:58.729 --> 00:02:58.739 
breathe so that you don't get that

00:02:58.739 --> 00:03:01.580 
breathe so that you don't get that
leather<00:02:59.420> smell<00:03:00.420> on<00:03:00.690> the<00:03:00.840> back<00:03:01.019> of<00:03:01.200> your<00:03:01.319> hand

00:03:01.580 --> 00:03:01.590 
leather smell on the back of your hand

00:03:01.590 --> 00:03:05.650 
leather smell on the back of your hand
and<00:03:01.910> your<00:03:02.910> hands<00:03:03.180> tend<00:03:03.569> not<00:03:03.630> to<00:03:03.780> sweat<00:03:04.230> as<00:03:04.500> bad

00:03:05.650 --> 00:03:05.660 
and your hands tend not to sweat as bad

00:03:05.660 --> 00:03:10.220 
and your hands tend not to sweat as bad
and<00:03:06.660> so<00:03:07.459> long<00:03:08.459> story<00:03:08.790> short<00:03:08.940> I<00:03:09.480> love<00:03:10.019> these

00:03:10.220 --> 00:03:10.230

00:03:10.230 --> 00:03:12.650 
and so long story short I love these
gloves<00:03:10.560> but<00:03:11.430> they're<00:03:11.970> not<00:03:12.180> really

00:03:12.650 --> 00:03:12.660 
gloves but they're not really

00:03:12.660 --> 00:03:16.550 
gloves but they're not really
recommended<00:03:13.230> by<00:03:13.410> me<00:03:13.620> for<00:03:14.010> anything<00:03:14.430> under<00:03:15.560> 25

00:03:16.550 --> 00:03:16.560 
recommended by me for anything under 25

00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:19.550 
recommended by me for anything under 25
degrees<00:03:17.010> 20<00:03:17.760> degrees<00:03:17.790> is<00:03:18.329> pushing<00:03:18.750> it<00:03:18.870> because

00:03:19.550 --> 00:03:19.560 
degrees 20 degrees is pushing it because

00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:21.259 
degrees 20 degrees is pushing it because
you<00:03:19.860> need<00:03:20.040> to<00:03:20.130> take<00:03:20.220> care<00:03:20.579> of<00:03:20.610> your<00:03:20.790> fingers

00:03:21.259 --> 00:03:21.269 
you need to take care of your fingers

00:03:21.269 --> 00:03:25.120 
you need to take care of your fingers
and<00:03:21.510> they<00:03:22.200> don't<00:03:22.410> do<00:03:22.590> so<00:03:22.859> well<00:03:23.070> in<00:03:23.370> colder<00:03:23.970> wind

00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:25.130 
and they don't do so well in colder wind

00:03:25.130 --> 00:03:28.940 
and they don't do so well in colder wind
but<00:03:26.269> the<00:03:27.269> velcro<00:03:27.510> closures<00:03:28.260> tend<00:03:28.620> to<00:03:28.739> wear<00:03:28.920> out

00:03:28.940 --> 00:03:28.950 
but the velcro closures tend to wear out

00:03:28.950 --> 00:03:33.170 
but the velcro closures tend to wear out
after<00:03:29.549> a<00:03:29.579> while<00:03:31.130> but<00:03:32.130> I<00:03:32.160> really<00:03:32.730> like<00:03:32.940> the

00:03:33.170 --> 00:03:33.180 
after a while but I really like the

00:03:33.180 --> 00:03:35.380 
after a while but I really like the
ironclad<00:03:33.810> digital<00:03:34.290> woodland<00:03:34.709> gloves<00:03:35.010> and

00:03:35.380 --> 00:03:35.390 
ironclad digital woodland gloves and

00:03:35.390 --> 00:03:39.140 
ironclad digital woodland gloves and
they<00:03:36.390> haven't<00:03:36.600> let<00:03:36.900> me<00:03:37.049> down<00:03:37.079> yet<00:03:37.560> a<00:03:37.970> few<00:03:38.970> other

00:03:39.140 --> 00:03:39.150 
they haven't let me down yet a few other

00:03:39.150 --> 00:03:41.060 
they haven't let me down yet a few other
things<00:03:39.450> that<00:03:39.630> I<00:03:39.780> like<00:03:39.810> about<00:03:40.170> these<00:03:40.500> gloves<00:03:40.799> is

00:03:41.060 --> 00:03:41.070 
things that I like about these gloves is

00:03:41.070 --> 00:03:44.810 
things that I like about these gloves is
the<00:03:41.700> leather<00:03:41.910> poem<00:03:42.390> in<00:03:42.720> them<00:03:42.980> is<00:03:43.980> thin<00:03:44.790> enough

00:03:44.810 --> 00:03:44.820 
the leather poem in them is thin enough

00:03:44.820 --> 00:03:48.039 
the leather poem in them is thin enough
that<00:03:45.750> as<00:03:45.900> I<00:03:46.049> said<00:03:46.109> it<00:03:46.380> allows<00:03:46.650> you<00:03:46.829> dexterity

00:03:48.039 --> 00:03:48.049 
that as I said it allows you dexterity

00:03:48.049 --> 00:03:52.880 
that as I said it allows you dexterity
but<00:03:49.049> it's<00:03:49.890> thick<00:03:50.220> enough<00:03:50.519> that<00:03:51.410> it<00:03:52.410> protects

00:03:52.880 --> 00:03:52.890 
but it's thick enough that it protects

00:03:52.890 --> 00:03:57.710 
but it's thick enough that it protects
your<00:03:53.100> hands<00:03:53.519> from<00:03:54.359> a<00:03:54.900> hot<00:03:55.560> barrel<00:03:56.160> and<00:03:56.720> the

00:04:05.190 --> 00:04:10.069 
stopping thorns from penetrate we tested

them with hot brass and brass deflection

00:04:10.079 --> 00:04:12.259 
them with hot brass and brass deflection
