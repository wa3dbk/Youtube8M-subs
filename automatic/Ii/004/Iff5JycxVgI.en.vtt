00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:19.960
 for the twentieth edition of cartoomics 

00:00:17.650 --> 00:00:23.140
 which is the cosplay cartoon salon 

00:00:19.960 --> 00:00:24.160
 new cartoon comic classic on new 

00:00:23.140 --> 00:00:26.050
 media and book 

00:00:24.160 --> 00:00:28.869
 in short, all that is clouds 

00:00:26.050 --> 00:00:30.779
 speaking is in a new location that I was at 

00:00:28.869 --> 00:00:33.640
 fieramilano and that is also enough 

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:35.290
 suitable for celebrating the great 

00:00:33.640 --> 00:00:37.210
 celebrated this year that iron man 3 

00:00:35.290 --> 00:00:39.250
 which architecturally binds to that 

00:00:37.210 --> 00:00:43.149
 which is the armor that distinguishes 

00:00:39.250 --> 00:00:46.629
 this great ironman hero this year 

00:00:43.149 --> 00:00:48.760
 turns 50 and proves it by showing off 

00:00:46.629 --> 00:00:52.390
 an armor that is very very different from 

00:00:48.760 --> 00:00:54.489
 the one he had at the beginning is perhaps the 

00:00:52.390 --> 00:00:57.309
 why he managed to survive 

00:00:54.489 --> 00:00:58.179
 so much to become so recently 

00:00:57.309 --> 00:00:59.769
 one of the most important passages 

00:00:58.179 --> 00:01:02.050
 the universe marvels its own 

00:00:59.769 --> 00:01:05.050
 continuous updating at the beginning had 

00:01:02.050 --> 00:01:07.900
 a kind of stove box 

00:01:05.050 --> 00:01:10.329
 gray as we see in the first film is then 

00:01:07.900 --> 00:01:12.970
 went progressively following the 

00:01:10.329 --> 00:01:14.890
 mode following the technology and this is it 

00:01:12.970 --> 00:01:20.799
 what we tried to show 

00:01:14.890 --> 00:01:23.110
 within our exhibition the 

00:01:20.799 --> 00:01:24.850
 second exhibition is dedicated instead to eva 

00:01:23.110 --> 00:01:26.380
 kant who turns fifty years old 

00:01:24.850 --> 00:01:28.750
 great exhibition staged by mario gomboli 

00:01:26.380 --> 00:01:29.920
 and that like the diabolik exhibition of the year 

00:01:28.750 --> 00:01:31.780
 last will become a traveling exhibition 

00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:33.280
 for the rest of Italy 

00:01:31.780 --> 00:01:34.509
 we brought luck to that 

00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:36.760
 diabolik and we hope to bring 

00:01:34.509 --> 00:01:39.370
 just as much luck as a vacation 

00:01:36.760 --> 00:01:42.650
 we have collected original documents 

00:01:39.370 --> 00:01:44.720
 drawings of the time there is the table in which 

00:01:42.650 --> 00:01:46.160
 for the first time it appears vacant 

00:01:44.720 --> 00:01:49.790
 entering the excelsior hotel 

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:52.550
 in 63 the original table of the remake of 

00:01:49.790 --> 00:01:54.650
 ten years later it is that of dogfish 

00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:57.320
 of the last remake of last year but 

00:01:54.650 --> 00:01:58.520
 not only are there period documents 

00:01:57.320 --> 00:02:02.120
 the sister typewriter 

00:01:58.520 --> 00:02:05.240
 giussani their journalist theses there 

00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:07.070
 I'm almost a memorabilia script but 

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:09.170
 even many new things even 

00:02:07.070 --> 00:02:11.060
 prototypes of delicate objects eva kant 

00:02:09.170 --> 00:02:12.800
 which will appear only in the second 

00:02:11.060 --> 00:02:16.340
 half of this year even the year 

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:18.320
 next the third shows a big one 

00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:21.200
 tradition of cartoomics and exhibition 

00:02:18.320 --> 00:02:23.450
 dedicated to erotica is an erotica 

00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:26.180
 obviously not a hard mold but a 

00:02:23.450 --> 00:02:28.550
 accessible erotic we say above 14 

00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:31.640
 years is not vm18 and is an exhibition 

00:02:28.550 --> 00:02:34.040
 this year dedicated to how the major 

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:36.910
 Italian illustrators and do not have 

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:36.910
 represented the kamasutra 

00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:42.640
 when we think of kamasutra 

00:02:39.220 --> 00:02:44.630
 let's imagine a catalog of positions 

00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:46.610
 nothing more wrong because the 

00:02:44.630 --> 00:02:51.080
 kamasutra is a real treatise 

00:02:46.610 --> 00:02:53.770
 of civil life because it certainly explains 64 

00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:55.970
 positions however also tells us how 

00:02:53.770 --> 00:02:58.370
 women must be treated like 

00:02:55.970 --> 00:03:00.170
 find wife how to betray his wife 

00:02:58.370 --> 00:03:01.790
 don't be discovered 

00:03:00.170 --> 00:03:13.790
 is a book that has always stimulated the 

00:03:01.790 --> 00:03:15.580
 comics authors the forest area 

00:03:13.790 --> 00:03:18.769
 magic is one of the novelties of cartoomics 

00:03:15.580 --> 00:03:20.900
 2013 is an area dedicated to everything 

00:03:18.769 --> 00:03:23.750
 it has to do with fantasy then 

00:03:20.900 --> 00:03:25.970
 dwarf elf dragon knights this year e 

00:03:23.750 --> 00:03:28.100
 we dedicated it to tolkien talkin è 

00:03:25.970 --> 00:03:29.120
 the author of the lord of the rings of the 

00:03:28.100 --> 00:03:32.390
 hobbit 

00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:33.950
 everyone knows it perhaps more for the movies 

00:03:32.390 --> 00:03:37.220
 of jackson than for his books 

00:03:33.950 --> 00:03:40.940
 however he is considered the father of 

00:03:37.220 --> 00:03:43.790
 fantasy genre of the man he sought 

00:03:40.940 --> 00:03:46.150
 to rediscover and revive the Middle Ages 

00:03:43.790 --> 00:03:46.150
 fantastic 

00:03:53.620 --> 00:03:59.599
 the action area is perhaps the novelty 

00:03:56.390 --> 00:04:01.450
 cartoomics main 2013 is an area 

00:03:59.599 --> 00:04:04.220
 very particular because extremely 

00:04:01.450 --> 00:04:07.250
 contaminated here we talk about comics of 

00:04:04.220 --> 00:04:10.250
 costuming literature cinema yes 

00:04:07.250 --> 00:04:10.780
 talk about adrenaline 360 ​​adventures 

00:04:10.250 --> 00:04:14.480
 degrees 

00:04:10.780 --> 00:04:16.669
 the idea comes from the celebration of 40 

00:04:14.480 --> 00:04:19.850
 years of bruce lee's death 

00:04:16.669 --> 00:04:22.669
 The man who brought down the 

00:04:19.850 --> 00:04:26.030
 kung fu in the cinema telling heaven in 

00:04:22.669 --> 00:04:28.830
 extremely spectacular 

00:04:26.030 --> 00:04:30.960
 we are a saipan next association 

00:04:28.830 --> 00:04:31.889
 men dedicated in particular to the saga of 

00:04:30.960 --> 00:04:33.569
 resident i vol 

00:04:31.889 --> 00:04:35.840
 we represent the umbrella here 

00:04:33.569 --> 00:04:38.280
 corporation we try to rebuild 

00:04:35.840 --> 00:04:39.930
 atmospheres and environments taken from the saga 

00:04:38.280 --> 00:04:42.169
 of video game films by residents 

00:04:39.930 --> 00:04:42.169
 vol 

00:04:42.800 --> 00:04:47.340
 there is a big news concerning the 

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:49.800
 music is called Nov satisfaction 

00:04:47.340 --> 00:04:51.960
 yesterday because of the satisfaction of the 

00:04:49.800 --> 00:04:53.509
 rolling stones at yesterday's beatles 

00:04:51.960 --> 00:04:55.800
 we tried to connect two 

00:04:53.509 --> 00:04:57.900
 fifty years in short we have a little 

00:04:55.800 --> 00:05:00.240
 cheated because in reality the first album 

00:04:57.900 --> 00:05:02.820
 of the beatles and the 63 but the first 45 rpm 

00:05:00.240 --> 00:05:04.500
 to 62 while in 60 30 

00:05:02.820 --> 00:05:06.740
 information in rolling stones 

00:05:04.500 --> 00:05:09.630
 so charlie watts so we have 

00:05:06.740 --> 00:05:11.699
 invented in quotation marks two fifty years 

00:05:09.630 --> 00:05:13.919
 because to celebrate them and there is one 

00:05:11.699 --> 00:05:15.680
 great exhibition where the exhibits are exhibited 

00:05:13.919 --> 00:05:17.460
 tables of all appearances 

00:05:15.680 --> 00:05:19.699
 rolling beats comics 

00:05:17.460 --> 00:05:19.699
 stones 

00:05:23.930 --> 00:05:28.699
 the people of cartoomics a people 

00:05:25.789 --> 00:05:31.310
 really very rich and very varied 

00:05:28.699 --> 00:05:33.860
 because the boys the young ones 

00:05:31.310 --> 00:05:37.220
 oriented towards cosplay they are 

00:05:33.860 --> 00:05:39.110
 truly thousands constitute one 

00:05:37.220 --> 00:05:40.460
 slice of our audience but not the 

00:05:39.110 --> 00:05:42.350
 totality of our audience 

00:05:40.460 --> 00:05:44.060
 always remain fans of 

00:05:42.350 --> 00:05:45.770
 comics always remain 

00:05:44.060 --> 00:05:47.990
 fans of collecting that the 

00:05:45.770 --> 00:05:49.550
 the years go by however it does not yield but 

00:05:47.990 --> 00:05:51.710
 there is also a new collecting that 

00:05:49.550 --> 00:05:54.860
 it's about the comic-book manga 

00:05:51.710 --> 00:05:56.539
 more recent like rat man phenomena and then 

00:05:54.860 --> 00:05:57.199
 obviously the eternal comics 

00:05:56.539 --> 00:05:58.910
 bonelli 

00:05:57.199 --> 00:06:00.860
 what I like to think there is 

00:05:58.910 --> 00:06:03.979
 a part of the public that attracted to 

00:06:00.860 --> 00:06:05.840
 no one knows what comes from an idea 

00:06:03.979 --> 00:06:07.699
 without ever having set foot in a fair 

00:06:05.840 --> 00:06:11.229
 comics and then decide to return from 

00:06:07.699 --> 00:06:11.229
 now up to all future editions 

00:06:13.919 --> 00:06:16.919
 but
