the<00:00:08.820> tunze<00:00:09.389> protein<00:00:09.809> skimmer<00:00:10.200> that<00:00:10.380> I've<00:00:10.440> been

00:00:10.549 --> 00:00:10.559 
the tunze protein skimmer that I've been

00:00:10.559 --> 00:00:12.710 
the tunze protein skimmer that I've been
using<00:00:10.770> is<00:00:11.130> this<00:00:11.910> is<00:00:12.000> the<00:00:12.090> first<00:00:12.330> time<00:00:12.570> I'm

00:00:32.690 --> 00:00:32.700 
you can see that the the protein skimmer

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:37.459 
you can see that the the protein skimmer
does<00:00:33.090> fit<00:00:33.360> with<00:00:33.600> the<00:00:35.780> stock<00:00:36.780> lids<00:00:37.109> you<00:00:37.289> don't

00:00:37.459 --> 00:00:37.469 
does fit with the stock lids you don't

does fit with the stock lids you don't
have<00:00:37.559> to<00:00:37.680> mod<00:00:37.890> them<00:00:38.160> or<00:00:38.309> anything<00:00:38.539> the<00:00:39.539> only

00:00:39.650 --> 00:00:39.660 
have to mod them or anything the only

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:41.869 
have to mod them or anything the only
place<00:00:39.989> that<00:00:40.260> it's<00:00:40.410> modded<00:00:40.829> the<00:00:40.980> lid<00:00:41.190> is<00:00:41.430> from

00:00:41.869 --> 00:00:41.879 
place that it's modded the lid is from

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:45.049 
place that it's modded the lid is from
an<00:00:42.000> existing<00:00:42.239> one<00:00:42.890> and<00:00:43.890> it's<00:00:44.219> right<00:00:44.820> here<00:00:44.850> at

00:00:45.049 --> 00:00:45.059 
an existing one and it's right here at

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:48.080 
an existing one and it's right here at
the<00:00:45.239> corner<00:00:46.850> okay

00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:48.090 
the corner okay

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:51.410 
the corner okay
so<00:00:48.899> that<00:00:49.079> way<00:00:49.199> my<00:00:49.640> black<00:00:50.640> tubing<00:00:51.030> can<00:00:51.179> pass

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:51.420 
so that way my black tubing can pass

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:54.500 
so that way my black tubing can pass
through<00:00:52.640> let's<00:00:53.640> go<00:00:53.760> ahead<00:00:53.850> and<00:00:54.030> take<00:00:54.179> the<00:00:54.329> lid

00:00:57.369 --> 00:00:57.379 
off right here just the lid for now

00:00:57.379 --> 00:01:02.930 
off right here just the lid for now
let's<00:00:58.379> see<00:00:58.530> what<00:00:58.679> we<00:00:58.800> got<00:01:00.199> nice<00:01:01.640> foam<00:01:02.640> on<00:01:02.850> the

let's see what we got nice foam on the

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:05.060 
let's see what we got nice foam on the
lid<00:01:03.120> and<00:01:03.989> you<00:01:04.140> can<00:01:04.170> see<00:01:04.409> that's<00:01:04.559> coming<00:01:05.010> up

00:01:05.060 --> 00:01:05.070 
lid and you can see that's coming up

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:07.190 
lid and you can see that's coming up
right<00:01:05.339> there<00:01:05.610> and<00:01:05.790> it's<00:01:06.180> actually<00:01:06.390> almost<00:01:06.990> to

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:07.200 
right there and it's actually almost to

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:20.760 
right there and it's actually almost to
the<00:01:07.320> top<00:01:07.530> let<00:01:08.490> me<00:01:08.580> just<00:01:08.790> zoom<00:01:08.850> in<00:01:09.210> for<00:01:09.360> you<00:01:09.480> guys

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:27.280 
gunk that has been collecting is almost

00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:29.210 
gunk that has been collecting is almost
the<00:01:27.520> top<00:01:27.700> it<00:01:27.939> probably<00:01:28.210> has<00:01:28.329> another

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:29.220 
the top it probably has another

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:31.560 
the top it probably has another
quarter<00:01:30.220> inch<00:01:30.399> till<00:01:30.670> it<00:01:30.759> gets<00:01:30.970> there<00:01:31.180> so<00:01:31.420> what

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:31.570 
quarter inch till it gets there so what

00:01:31.570 --> 00:01:33.330 
quarter inch till it gets there so what
I'm<00:01:31.630> going<00:01:31.750> to<00:01:31.780> do<00:01:31.990> is<00:01:32.110> up<00:01:32.229> with<00:01:32.409> the<00:01:32.500> skimmer

00:01:33.330 --> 00:01:33.340 
I'm going to do is up with the skimmer

00:01:33.340 --> 00:01:49.999 
I'm going to do is up with the skimmer

the skimmer off and take out the
collection<00:01:57.610> cup<00:01:58.619> let's<00:01:59.619> go<00:02:00.220> ahead<00:02:00.340> and<00:02:00.640> lift

00:02:01.080 --> 00:02:01.090 
collection cup let's go ahead and lift

00:02:01.090 --> 00:02:06.240 
collection cup let's go ahead and lift
it<00:02:01.299> out<00:02:01.420> and<00:02:03.750> let's<00:02:04.750> get<00:02:04.929> a<00:02:04.990> good<00:02:05.679> look<00:02:05.920> at<00:02:06.069> this

can see it without me spilling but you
could<00:02:38.650> actually<00:02:38.769> see<00:02:39.190> some<00:02:39.400> stuff<00:02:40.060> floating

00:02:41.009 --> 00:02:41.019 
could actually see some stuff floating

00:02:41.019 --> 00:02:43.250 
could actually see some stuff floating
there<00:02:41.230> on<00:02:41.350> the<00:02:41.440> top<00:02:41.620> of<00:02:41.739> the<00:02:41.829> order<00:02:42.040> so<00:02:42.940> I<00:02:42.970> have

00:02:43.250 --> 00:02:43.260 
there on the top of the order so I have

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:47.430 
there on the top of the order so I have
proteins<00:02:44.519> that<00:02:45.519> used<00:02:45.910> to<00:02:46.060> collect<00:02:46.269> back<00:02:47.049> here

00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:47.440 
proteins that used to collect back here

00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:49.259 
proteins that used to collect back here
and<00:02:47.590> the<00:02:47.769> skimmer<00:02:48.070> has<00:02:48.190> pulled<00:02:48.700> it<00:02:48.820> out<00:02:48.910> so<00:02:49.150> I'm

00:02:49.259 --> 00:02:49.269 
and the skimmer has pulled it out so I'm

00:02:49.269 --> 00:02:51.990 
and the skimmer has pulled it out so I'm
gonna<00:02:49.510> go<00:02:49.630> do<00:02:49.840> now<00:02:50.019> I'm<00:02:50.980> gonna<00:02:51.130> go<00:02:51.310> dump<00:02:51.819> this

00:02:51.990 --> 00:02:52.000 
gonna go do now I'm gonna go dump this

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:53.849 
gonna go do now I'm gonna go dump this
out<00:02:52.180> cleaning<00:02:52.720> out<00:02:52.840> the<00:02:52.989> cup<00:02:53.200> and<00:02:53.500> they'll<00:02:53.709> be

00:02:53.849 --> 00:02:53.859 
out cleaning out the cup and they'll be

00:02:53.859 --> 00:02:56.849 
out cleaning out the cup and they'll be
right<00:02:53.980> back<00:02:54.250> to<00:02:54.609> show<00:02:55.140> you<00:02:56.140> how<00:02:56.319> I<00:02:56.380> put<00:02:56.620> it<00:02:56.739> back

00:02:56.849 --> 00:02:56.859 
right back to show you how I put it back

00:02:56.859 --> 00:02:59.580 
right back to show you how I put it back
on<00:02:57.100> alright<00:02:57.819> so<00:02:57.970> I've<00:02:58.030> gone<00:02:58.180> ahead<00:02:58.329> and<00:02:58.590> plug

00:02:59.580 --> 00:02:59.590 
on alright so I've gone ahead and plug

00:02:59.590 --> 00:03:02.849 
on alright so I've gone ahead and plug
the<00:02:59.829> protein<00:03:00.549> skimmer<00:03:00.670> back<00:03:01.060> in<00:03:01.299> as<00:03:01.739> you<00:03:02.739> can

00:03:02.849 --> 00:03:02.859 
the protein skimmer back in as you can

00:03:02.859 --> 00:03:05.190 
the protein skimmer back in as you can
see<00:03:03.010> it's<00:03:03.130> starting<00:03:03.670> to<00:03:03.819> foam<00:03:04.060> up<00:03:04.269> what<00:03:05.139> you

00:03:05.190 --> 00:03:05.200 
see it's starting to foam up what you

00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:06.599 
see it's starting to foam up what you
saw<00:03:05.380> before<00:03:05.530> like<00:03:05.769> I<00:03:05.859> said<00:03:06.040> was<00:03:06.190> about<00:03:06.310> three

00:03:06.599 --> 00:03:06.609 
saw before like I said was about three

00:03:06.609 --> 00:03:09.569 
saw before like I said was about three
days<00:03:06.760> of<00:03:07.000> skimming<00:03:07.859> which<00:03:08.859> gives<00:03:09.130> me<00:03:09.310> a<00:03:09.340> good

00:03:09.569 --> 00:03:09.579 
days of skimming which gives me a good

00:03:09.579 --> 00:03:12.629 
days of skimming which gives me a good
idea<00:03:09.700> of<00:03:09.970> one<00:03:10.209> to<00:03:10.450> know<00:03:10.889> when<00:03:11.889> I<00:03:11.950> have<00:03:12.220> to<00:03:12.370> empty

00:03:12.629 --> 00:03:12.639 
idea of one to know when I have to empty

00:03:12.639 --> 00:03:15.210 
idea of one to know when I have to empty
the<00:03:12.760> collection<00:03:13.209> cup<00:03:13.389> and<00:03:13.690> that<00:03:14.410> is<00:03:14.620> producing

00:03:15.210 --> 00:03:15.220 
the collection cup and that is producing

00:03:15.220 --> 00:03:17.370 
the collection cup and that is producing
some<00:03:15.489> some<00:03:16.420> good<00:03:16.690> results

00:03:17.370 --> 00:03:17.380 
some some good results

00:03:17.380 --> 00:03:20.309
