 5-strand braid is two ordinary braids 

00:00:03.720 --> 00:00:09.990
 tell me brady was brushing his hair to the side and 

00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:12.719
 we divide on the one hand about the fifth 

00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:15.540
 part of the hair and on the other hand the fifth 

00:00:12.719 --> 00:00:19.020
 part of the central strand is divided into three 

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:26.910
 pieces and make two weave normal 

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:30.359
 braids thumb hold the top 

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:34.500
 strand your head on your index finger 

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:36.570
 we will throw the lower strand and add free 

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:40.020
 strand between index and large 

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:45.200
 fingers remove the lock of index 

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:45.200
 fingers and connect with the lower strand 

00:00:49.399 --> 00:00:55.829
 thus, in both hands, two strands 

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:57.680
 now also hold your thumb 

00:00:55.829 --> 00:01:00.660
 hi head 

00:00:57.680 --> 00:01:04.739
 we will throw an extreme lock on index 

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:06.840
 we put the finger and the fifth strand between the big 

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:12.689
 and middle fingers 

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:15.229
 we connect the upper strand to the lower now 

00:01:12.689 --> 00:01:20.039
 in the left hand are three strands 

00:01:15.229 --> 00:01:25.679
 extremely strand we get under the bottom seize 

00:01:20.039 --> 00:01:32.789
 her right hand and top attach 

00:01:25.679 --> 00:01:36.390
 funnier now three strands on the extreme right 

00:01:32.789 --> 00:01:40.289
 we get a lock under a bottom we seize 

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:46.549
 fingers of the left hand and connect the top 

00:01:40.289 --> 00:01:52.849
 and the bottom strands repeat the movement on the left 

00:01:46.549 --> 00:01:56.569
 extreme under the bottom captured with the right hand 

00:01:52.849 --> 00:02:00.439
 connected upper and lower 

00:01:56.569 --> 00:02:03.799
 now we start the strand under the bottom 

00:02:00.439 --> 00:02:10.979
 grab the fingers of his left hand and 

00:02:03.799 --> 00:02:15.560
 connect the top and bottom strands and so 

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:15.560
 continue weaving along the entire hair length 

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:23.510
 notice that we weave 100 hands in 

00:02:19.950 --> 00:02:27.049
 which are three strands 

00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:44.360

00:02:44.360 --> 00:03:04.220
