 I'm going to fix mushrooms here 

00:00:07.710 --> 00:00:11.910
 There is a rich mesh sauce 

00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:13.920
 huitlacoche corazoncito irwin las a 

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:17.630
 put the buoys here also very well 

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:23.310
 Bunny and totally made this side 

00:00:17.630 --> 00:00:25.260
 Garlic garlic went down fine very well we go well and 

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:28.740
 I'm going to do it with my mom a cake 

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:30.779
 so a totana pie is the big mistake of 

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:34.130
 the peanut pastry for people who 

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:34.130
 they founded the state sisters 

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:41.190
 in toulouse de france and see what 

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:43.860
 you think that happened they forgot they work 

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:45.809
 a function a candy put some 

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:47.129
 apples but they can give absent-minded 

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:50.129
 the kitchen nothing but pressure in the 

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:51.750
 top part puff pastry and when 

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:53.010
 turned to the delicious cake was 

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:54.629
 they realize that others see the 

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:57.000
 apples because they do not have to say 

00:00:54.629 --> 00:00:59.399
 then you go out big mistakes of the 

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:01.020
 pastry was very rich very very bad 

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:06.140
 success so so 

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:06.140
 more or less than in 1800 1900 

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:11.910
 well I'm going to add mushrooms 

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:14.400
 remember that the mushroom is 

00:01:11.910 --> 00:01:16.130
 sliced ​​and the mushroom has a lot 

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:19.140
 humidity 99 percent of its 

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:21.540
 consistency is water and I need that 

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:23.290
 it's a little dry that the ok asks for that 

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:27.610
 side 

00:01:23.290 --> 00:01:30.010
 I'm going to put the huitlacoche the fungus that 

00:01:27.610 --> 00:01:31.870
 it comes out to the corn that nothing else could 

00:01:30.010 --> 00:01:35.350
 eat at the time of the Aztecs not 

00:01:31.870 --> 00:01:37.870
 can people eat now that they already 

00:01:35.350 --> 00:01:39.610
 that there were levels since then man and 

00:01:37.870 --> 00:01:42.300
 does not mean anything but also 

00:01:39.610 --> 00:01:42.300
 racists 

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:48.990
 those above and those below 

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:58.950
 I am not a pretty virgin 

00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:03.820
 they will move us 

00:02:01.930 --> 00:02:05.770
 so that they pull me out in the heart 

00:02:03.820 --> 00:02:10.390
 manuel site of all things and I have 

00:02:05.770 --> 00:02:14.260
 one to one super guest they are the 

00:02:10.390 --> 00:02:16.270
 blue angels that go is something we're going 

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:18.280
 to practice with this super event that 

00:02:16.270 --> 00:02:23.290
 they are going to fear to have a super event the 

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:25.600
 day 8 that dance with me because they have 

00:02:23.290 --> 00:02:27.340
 had many successes man and dedicate yourself 

00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:28.720
 that if they are telling that they are recording 

00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:30.400
 with the tape you just recorded with the 

00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:32.410
 5 nicest with the brigades that do not 

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:35.709
 anybody not the little heart 

00:02:32.410 --> 00:02:37.690
 and nothing else is huitlacoche if you 

00:02:35.709 --> 00:02:40.390
 you do not find this cool in the 

00:02:37.690 --> 00:02:43.030
 can replace it with can and the 

00:02:40.390 --> 00:02:46.090
 can is much cheaper many times 

00:02:43.030 --> 00:02:49.420
 many times cheaper than something is left 

00:02:46.090 --> 00:02:51.820
 very good and is the most usual and 

00:02:49.420 --> 00:02:53.200
