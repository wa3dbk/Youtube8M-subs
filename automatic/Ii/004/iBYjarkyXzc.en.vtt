 hello to all friends of tuttoandroid.net 

00:00:07.640 --> 00:00:12.320
 we are a new world congress 

00:00:09.800 --> 00:00:15.290
 this is the latest galaxy brand 

00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:16.609
 Smartphones from the mid-range of Samsung 

00:00:15.290 --> 00:00:19.880
 let's start from the technical characteristics 

00:00:16.609 --> 00:00:23.630
 we find this display very large e 

00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:28.399
 5-inch with qvga resolution ie 

00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:31.849
 800 x 480 we find inside a 

00:00:28.399 --> 00:00:33.710
 1.2 gigahertz dual core processor 

00:00:31.849 --> 00:00:35.780
 which, as you can see, manages to make 

00:00:33.710 --> 00:00:39.410
 sufficiently fluid experience 

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:42.379
 use a gigabyte of ram and a battery 

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:47.620
 since 2100 milian for eastman hour 

00:00:42.379 --> 00:00:52.609
 operating is android 4.1.2 jelly bean 

00:00:47.620 --> 00:00:56.170
 as we can see from the screen 

00:00:52.609 --> 00:00:56.170
 of android settings 

00:00:57.280 --> 00:01:01.120
 the device is quite large like 

00:00:59.289 --> 00:01:04.150
 see in my hand if we look at the 

00:01:01.120 --> 00:01:06.790
 rest of the device we find one 

00:01:04.150 --> 00:01:11.549
 8 megapixel camera with autofocus 

00:01:06.790 --> 00:01:14.680
 and the LED flash at the side is the 

00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:17.020
 the rear speaker on the side 

00:01:14.680 --> 00:01:20.320
 left we find the balance of the 

00:01:17.020 --> 00:01:24.190
 volume on the upper side we find the 

00:01:20.320 --> 00:01:27.220
 3.5mm headphone jack on the side 

00:01:24.190 --> 00:01:29.440
 right housing the power button e 

00:01:27.220 --> 00:01:33.390
 switch off while the side instead 

00:01:29.440 --> 00:01:35.530
 lower houses the micro usb port 

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:37.869
 clearly how it went to class 

00:01:35.530 --> 00:01:42.520
 samsung there are three keys including 2 soft 

00:01:37.869 --> 00:01:44.140
 touch what to say is a device that 

00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:46.140
 could have its own market at the moment 

00:01:44.140 --> 00:01:49.420
 no details were communicated to us 

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:52.000
 on marketing in Europe 

00:01:49.420 --> 00:01:54.190
 also because this device is in 

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:59.020
 this version you see dual sim 

00:01:54.190 --> 00:02:00.940
 but there is also a single version 

00:01:59.020 --> 00:02:02.560
 we do n't know yet if it will arrive in 

00:02:00.940 --> 00:02:04.840
 europa since it was not communicated 

00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:08.170
 but we hope that at least it arrives in Italy 

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:10.600
 in its single sim version for the 

00:02:08.170 --> 00:02:13.110
 moment I would say that it is all from the mobile 

00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:16.110
 world congress 2013 riccardo per 

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:16.110
