which<00:01:15.600> I'm<00:01:15.750> still<00:01:15.840> only<00:01:16.080> nailing<00:01:16.470> about<00:01:16.680> one

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:16.830 
which I'm still only nailing about one

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:21.170 
which I'm still only nailing about one
in<00:01:16.920> five<00:01:17.100> times<00:01:17.400> but<00:01:19.549> 15<00:01:20.549> is<00:01:20.700> still<00:01:20.880> something

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:21.180 
in five times but 15 is still something

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:22.820 
in five times but 15 is still something
and<00:01:21.479> I<00:01:21.540> wanted<00:01:21.750> to<00:01:21.810> at<00:01:22.020> least<00:01:22.229> like<00:01:22.560> put<00:01:22.799> a

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:22.830 
and I wanted to at least like put a

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:24.440 
and I wanted to at least like put a
video<00:01:23.040> out<00:01:23.159> there<00:01:23.340> describing<00:01:23.820> to<00:01:24.180> you<00:01:24.270> guys

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:24.450

how<00:01:24.810> I<00:01:24.840> got<00:01:25.229> that<00:01:26.070> far<00:01:26.340> which<00:01:26.909> is<00:01:26.939> to<00:01:27.210> say<00:01:27.240> that

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:27.540 
how I got that far which is to say that

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:28.850 
how I got that far which is to say that
I<00:01:27.570> actually<00:01:27.750> started<00:01:28.110> off<00:01:28.320> with<00:01:28.530> the<00:01:28.650> move

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:28.860 
I actually started off with the move

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:32.600 
I actually started off with the move
that<00:01:30.770> wouldn't<00:01:31.770> seem<00:01:31.920> it<00:01:32.070> first<00:01:32.280> like<00:01:32.460> it's

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:32.610 
that wouldn't seem it first like it's

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:35.780 
that wouldn't seem it first like it's
related<00:01:33.000> at<00:01:33.119> all<00:01:33.240> which<00:01:33.600> is<00:01:34.250> kind<00:01:35.250> of<00:01:35.400> taking

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:35.790 
related at all which is kind of taking

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:37.969 
related at all which is kind of taking
these<00:01:36.150> contact<00:01:36.750> rolls<00:01:36.960> right<00:01:37.140> here<00:01:37.470> where

00:01:37.969 --> 00:01:37.979 
these contact rolls right here where

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:39.200 
these contact rolls right here where
you're<00:01:38.130> spinning<00:01:38.400> split<00:01:38.790> time<00:01:38.970> same

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:39.210 
you're spinning split time same

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:43.280 
you're spinning split time same
direction<00:01:39.450> reverse<00:01:40.020> and<00:01:40.640> doing<00:01:41.640> that<00:01:42.000> as<00:01:42.360> a

direction reverse and doing that as a
series<00:01:43.979> of<00:01:44.009> two<00:01:44.280> tosses<00:01:45.020> the<00:01:46.020> kind<00:01:46.320> of<00:01:46.380> reverse

00:01:46.639 --> 00:01:46.649 
series of two tosses the kind of reverse

00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:49.100 
series of two tosses the kind of reverse
isolated<00:01:47.310> throw<00:01:47.579> where<00:01:47.880> you<00:01:48.360> toss<00:01:48.659> the<00:01:48.720> tether

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:49.110 
isolated throw where you toss the tether

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:55.370 
isolated throw where you toss the tether
up<00:01:49.350> rather<00:01:49.890> than<00:01:50.360> rather<00:01:51.360> than<00:01:51.600> down<00:01:52.159> and<00:01:54.380> then

00:01:55.370 --> 00:01:55.380 
up rather than rather than down and then

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:57.139 
up rather than rather than down and then
getting<00:01:55.799> the<00:01:56.009> contact<00:01:56.460> rolls<00:01:56.700> out<00:01:56.880> of<00:01:57.030> them

00:01:57.139 --> 00:01:57.149 
getting the contact rolls out of them

00:01:57.149 --> 00:01:59.450 
getting the contact rolls out of them
why<00:01:57.390> was<00:01:57.570> this<00:01:57.719> important<00:01:58.320> big<00:01:58.829> big<00:01:59.040> reason

00:01:59.450 --> 00:01:59.460 
why was this important big big reason

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:01.429 
why was this important big big reason
because<00:02:00.060> it<00:02:00.210> taught<00:02:00.450> me<00:02:00.479> how<00:02:00.750> to<00:02:00.810> do<00:02:01.110> those

00:02:01.429 --> 00:02:01.439 
because it taught me how to do those

00:02:01.439 --> 00:02:04.010 
because it taught me how to do those
cradle<00:02:02.280> catches<00:02:02.729> in<00:02:02.969> that<00:02:03.299> kind<00:02:03.540> of<00:02:03.570> 12

00:02:04.010 --> 00:02:04.020 
cradle catches in that kind of 12

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:05.630 
cradle catches in that kind of 12
fashion<00:02:04.500> and<00:02:04.740> get<00:02:04.829> the<00:02:04.950> rolls<00:02:05.159> out<00:02:05.369> of<00:02:05.520> it

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:05.640 
fashion and get the rolls out of it

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:07.429 
fashion and get the rolls out of it
right<00:02:05.670> which<00:02:06.329> is<00:02:06.450> about<00:02:06.630> half<00:02:06.689> the<00:02:07.079> work<00:02:07.229> for

00:02:07.429 --> 00:02:07.439 
right which is about half the work for

00:02:07.439 --> 00:02:10.729 
right which is about half the work for
the<00:02:07.500> other<00:02:07.619> move<00:02:08.569> and<00:02:09.569> even<00:02:10.200> as<00:02:10.319> you<00:02:10.440> can<00:02:10.560> see

00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:10.739 
the other move and even as you can see

00:02:10.739 --> 00:02:12.890 
the other move and even as you can see
here<00:02:11.190> this<00:02:11.970> one<00:02:12.180> still<00:02:12.420> isn't<00:02:12.599> a<00:02:12.629> hundred

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:12.900 
here this one still isn't a hundred

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:13.270 
here this one still isn't a hundred
percent

00:02:13.270 --> 00:02:13.280 
percent

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:15.820 
percent
but<00:02:13.819> some<00:02:14.150> it<00:02:14.630> was<00:02:15.020> at<00:02:15.170> least<00:02:15.290> an<00:02:15.560> easy

00:02:15.820 --> 00:02:15.830 
but some it was at least an easy

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:17.290 
but some it was at least an easy
training<00:02:16.280> wheels<00:02:16.459> kind<00:02:16.730> of<00:02:16.790> way<00:02:16.880> for<00:02:17.090> getting

00:02:17.290 --> 00:02:17.300 
training wheels kind of way for getting

00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:18.550 
training wheels kind of way for getting
to<00:02:17.390> the<00:02:17.450> next<00:02:17.690> step<00:02:17.840> which<00:02:17.900> of<00:02:18.170> course<00:02:18.200> is

00:02:18.550 --> 00:02:18.560 
to the next step which of course is

00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:20.860 
to the next step which of course is
trying<00:02:19.220> to<00:02:19.370> do<00:02:19.490> the<00:02:19.610> same<00:02:19.819> thing<00:02:20.209> but<00:02:20.240> throwing

00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:20.870 
trying to do the same thing but throwing

00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:22.660 
trying to do the same thing but throwing
the<00:02:21.080> poi<00:02:21.290> over<00:02:21.709> your<00:02:21.830> shoulder<00:02:22.250> this<00:02:22.370> time

00:02:22.660 --> 00:02:22.670 
the poi over your shoulder this time

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:25.960 
the poi over your shoulder this time
instead<00:02:22.970> of<00:02:24.010> doing<00:02:25.010> the<00:02:25.100> reverse<00:02:25.340> isolated

00:02:25.960 --> 00:02:25.970 
instead of doing the reverse isolated

00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:28.900 
instead of doing the reverse isolated
throw<00:02:26.530> this<00:02:27.530> one<00:02:27.560> I<00:02:28.010> will<00:02:28.459> be<00:02:28.550> the<00:02:28.640> first<00:02:28.819> to

00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:28.910 
throw this one I will be the first to

00:02:28.910 --> 00:02:32.050 
throw this one I will be the first to
admit<00:02:29.030> is<00:02:29.360> still<00:02:29.720> really<00:02:30.590> really<00:02:30.770> sketchy<00:02:31.100> but

00:02:32.050 --> 00:02:32.060 
admit is still really really sketchy but

00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:33.160 
admit is still really really sketchy but
here<00:02:32.239> are<00:02:32.330> some<00:02:32.390> things<00:02:32.630> that<00:02:32.750> are<00:02:32.840> helping

00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:33.170 
here are some things that are helping

00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:35.830 
here are some things that are helping
out<00:02:33.319> with<00:02:33.410> it<00:02:33.560> number<00:02:33.830> one<00:02:34.010> if<00:02:34.880> you<00:02:35.450> look<00:02:35.630> at

00:02:35.830 --> 00:02:35.840 
out with it number one if you look at

00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:38.080 
out with it number one if you look at
how<00:02:36.080> I'm<00:02:36.440> turning<00:02:37.040> the<00:02:37.130> poi<00:02:37.340> from<00:02:37.700> straight

00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:38.090 
how I'm turning the poi from straight

00:02:38.090 --> 00:02:40.210 
how I'm turning the poi from straight
ahead<00:02:38.319> it's<00:02:39.319> actually<00:02:39.470> kind<00:02:39.680> of<00:02:39.830> an<00:02:39.950> atomic

00:02:40.210 --> 00:02:40.220 
ahead it's actually kind of an atomic

00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:43.240 
ahead it's actually kind of an atomic
arrangement<00:02:40.910> instead<00:02:41.450> of<00:02:41.630> a<00:02:41.890> wheel<00:02:42.890> plane

00:02:43.240 --> 00:02:43.250 
arrangement instead of a wheel plane

00:02:43.250 --> 00:02:45.460 
arrangement instead of a wheel plane
arrangement<00:02:43.910> like<00:02:44.030> this<00:02:44.060> and<00:02:44.569> as<00:02:45.080> you<00:02:45.290> can<00:02:45.440> see

00:02:45.460 --> 00:02:45.470 
arrangement like this and as you can see

00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:47.910 
arrangement like this and as you can see
if<00:02:45.800> I<00:02:45.920> turn<00:02:46.070> to<00:02:46.190> the<00:02:46.280> side<00:02:46.489> wheel<00:02:46.940> plane<00:02:47.239> and

00:02:47.910 --> 00:02:47.920 
if I turn to the side wheel plane and

00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:51.070 
if I turn to the side wheel plane and
that's<00:02:48.920> kind<00:02:49.610> of<00:02:49.640> atomic<00:02:49.940> fashion<00:02:50.660> it's<00:02:50.870> it's

00:02:51.070 --> 00:02:51.080 
that's kind of atomic fashion it's it's

00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:52.720 
that's kind of atomic fashion it's it's
almost<00:02:51.320> undetectable<00:02:51.890> to<00:02:52.280> the<00:02:52.430> audience

00:02:52.720 --> 00:02:52.730 
almost undetectable to the audience

00:02:52.730 --> 00:02:54.699 
almost undetectable to the audience
right<00:02:53.030> but<00:02:53.510> here's<00:02:53.660> what<00:02:53.810> it<00:02:53.900> does<00:02:54.110> do<00:02:54.350> it

00:02:54.699 --> 00:02:54.709 
right but here's what it does do it

00:02:54.709 --> 00:02:56.560 
right but here's what it does do it
means<00:02:55.040> that<00:02:55.220> those<00:02:55.340> catches<00:02:55.880> rather<00:02:56.180> than<00:02:56.330> hat

00:02:56.560 --> 00:02:56.570 
means that those catches rather than hat

00:02:56.570 --> 00:02:58.210 
means that those catches rather than hat
bringing<00:02:56.900> out<00:02:57.080> at<00:02:57.320> the<00:02:57.470> periphery<00:02:57.769> of<00:02:58.010> my

00:02:58.210 --> 00:02:58.220 
bringing out at the periphery of my

00:02:58.220 --> 00:02:59.830 
bringing out at the periphery of my
vision<00:02:58.580> actually<00:02:59.030> happened<00:02:59.420> more<00:02:59.540> towards

00:02:59.830 --> 00:02:59.840 
vision actually happened more towards

00:02:59.840 --> 00:03:01.809 
vision actually happened more towards
the<00:02:59.959> center<00:03:00.319> of<00:03:00.380> my<00:03:00.560> vision<00:03:00.890> so<00:03:01.310> I<00:03:01.340> can<00:03:01.580> focus

00:03:01.809 --> 00:03:01.819 
the center of my vision so I can focus

00:03:01.819 --> 00:03:04.630 
the center of my vision so I can focus
on<00:03:02.120> each<00:03:02.330> one<00:03:02.569> in<00:03:02.690> parallel<00:03:03.140> as<00:03:03.290> it<00:03:03.410> happens<00:03:03.800> so

00:03:04.630 --> 00:03:04.640 
on each one in parallel as it happens so

00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:12.070 
on each one in parallel as it happens so
let's<00:03:05.239> see<00:03:05.420> how<00:03:05.510> this<00:03:05.660> goes<00:03:10.390> so<00:03:11.390> in<00:03:11.660> theory

00:03:12.070 --> 00:03:12.080 
let's see how this goes so in theory

00:03:12.080 --> 00:03:17.410 
let's see how this goes so in theory
there<00:03:12.709> we<00:03:12.890> go<00:03:13.040> almost<00:03:13.790> I<00:03:15.670> can<00:03:16.670> then<00:03:16.819> focus<00:03:17.060> on

00:03:17.410 --> 00:03:17.420 
there we go almost I can then focus on

00:03:17.420 --> 00:03:19.030 
there we go almost I can then focus on
what's<00:03:17.690> directly<00:03:18.049> in<00:03:18.290> front<00:03:18.350> of<00:03:18.680> me<00:03:18.799> rather

00:03:19.030 --> 00:03:19.040 
what's directly in front of me rather

00:03:19.040 --> 00:03:21.340 
what's directly in front of me rather
than<00:03:19.190> having<00:03:19.489> to<00:03:19.630> divide<00:03:20.630> my<00:03:20.660> attention<00:03:20.840> to

00:03:21.340 --> 00:03:21.350 
than having to divide my attention to

00:03:23.440 --> 00:03:23.450 
the periphery of my vision and like I

00:03:23.450 --> 00:03:25.600 
the periphery of my vision and like I
said<00:03:23.510> it's<00:03:24.019> still<00:03:24.140> sketchy<00:03:24.590> but<00:03:24.890> it<00:03:25.220> happens

00:03:25.600 --> 00:03:25.610 
said it's still sketchy but it happens

00:03:25.610 --> 00:03:29.110 
said it's still sketchy but it happens
every<00:03:25.850> once<00:03:25.970> in<00:03:26.150> a<00:03:26.209> while<00:03:27.880> things<00:03:28.880> that<00:03:29.000> i<00:03:29.030> have

every once in a while things that i have
found<00:03:29.420> help<00:03:30.010> in<00:03:31.010> putting<00:03:31.579> this<00:03:31.730> together

00:03:32.130 --> 00:03:32.140 
found help in putting this together

00:03:32.140 --> 00:03:34.960 
found help in putting this together
number<00:03:33.140> one<00:03:33.350> if<00:03:33.470> you<00:03:33.560> can<00:03:33.709> start<00:03:33.950> off<00:03:34.190> by

00:03:34.960 --> 00:03:34.970 
number one if you can start off by

number one if you can start off by

having that tosco hi it gives you a

00:03:37.310 --> 00:03:39.100 
having that tosco hi it gives you a
little<00:03:37.489> bit<00:03:37.610> more<00:03:37.790> time<00:03:38.060> to<00:03:38.090> get<00:03:38.660> your<00:03:38.840> hands

00:03:39.100 --> 00:03:39.110 
little bit more time to get your hands

00:03:39.110 --> 00:03:42.190 
little bit more time to get your hands
in<00:03:39.230> position<00:03:39.290> for<00:03:40.130> the<00:03:40.160> catch<00:03:40.660> and<00:03:41.660> after

00:03:42.190 --> 00:03:42.200 
in position for the catch and after

00:03:42.200 --> 00:03:43.569 
in position for the catch and after
doing<00:03:42.500> that<00:03:42.650> a<00:03:42.769> few<00:03:42.890> times<00:03:43.070> what<00:03:43.370> I<00:03:43.430> actually

00:03:43.569 --> 00:03:43.579 
doing that a few times what I actually

00:03:43.579 --> 00:03:46.720 
doing that a few times what I actually
found<00:03:43.880> help<00:03:44.180> was<00:03:44.390> to<00:03:44.959> do<00:03:45.109> the<00:03:45.320> throw<00:03:45.799> as<00:03:46.070> low<00:03:46.549> as

00:03:46.720 --> 00:03:46.730 
found help was to do the throw as low as

00:03:46.730 --> 00:03:48.130 
found help was to do the throw as low as
possible<00:03:46.790> because<00:03:47.480> then<00:03:47.840> you're<00:03:47.989> actually

00:03:48.130 --> 00:03:48.140 
possible because then you're actually

00:03:48.140 --> 00:03:50.020 
possible because then you're actually
able<00:03:48.470> to<00:03:48.650> track<00:03:49.160> the<00:03:49.310> movement<00:03:49.670> of<00:03:49.700> the<00:03:49.760> poise

00:03:50.020 --> 00:03:50.030 
able to track the movement of the poise

00:03:50.030 --> 00:03:52.500 
able to track the movement of the poise
it<00:03:50.299> goes<00:03:50.450> over<00:03:50.660> your<00:03:50.750> shoulders<00:03:51.140> completely

00:03:52.500 --> 00:03:52.510 
it goes over your shoulders completely

00:03:52.510 --> 00:03:59.410 
it goes over your shoulders completely
like<00:03:53.510> that<00:03:54.940> whew<00:03:55.940> and<00:03:56.269> then<00:03:57.049> of<00:03:57.170> course<00:03:58.420> every

00:03:59.410 --> 00:03:59.420 
like that whew and then of course every

00:03:59.420 --> 00:04:00.940 
like that whew and then of course every
once<00:03:59.630> in<00:03:59.750> a<00:03:59.780> while<00:03:59.900> they<00:04:00.079> just<00:04:00.260> go<00:04:00.380> flying<00:04:00.680> and

00:04:00.940 --> 00:04:00.950 
once in a while they just go flying and

00:04:00.950 --> 00:04:04.630 
once in a while they just go flying and
it's<00:04:01.100> just<00:04:01.430> it's<00:04:01.730> part<00:04:02.150> of<00:04:02.180> the<00:04:02.269> work<00:04:02.450> to<00:04:03.640> to

00:04:04.630 --> 00:04:04.640 
it's just it's part of the work to to

00:04:04.640 --> 00:04:05.890 
it's just it's part of the work to to
get<00:04:04.790> it<00:04:04.880> back<00:04:04.970> and<00:04:05.209> do<00:04:05.269> it<00:04:05.299> better<00:04:05.540> next<00:04:05.720> time

00:04:05.890 --> 00:04:05.900 
get it back and do it better next time

00:04:05.900 --> 00:04:12.250 
get it back and do it better next time
so<00:04:07.209> move<00:04:09.549> yeah<00:04:10.549> that<00:04:10.730> this<00:04:10.940> I'm<00:04:11.600> not<00:04:12.079> going<00:04:12.200> to

00:04:12.250 --> 00:04:12.260 
so move yeah that this I'm not going to

00:04:12.260 --> 00:04:13.630 
so move yeah that this I'm not going to
lie<00:04:12.380> this<00:04:12.410> is<00:04:12.620> probably<00:04:12.950> one<00:04:13.160> of<00:04:13.190> the<00:04:13.340> toughest

00:04:13.630 --> 00:04:13.640 
lie this is probably one of the toughest

nail<00:04:22.760> that<00:04:22.970> catch<00:04:23.270> is<00:04:23.630> you<00:04:23.690> could<00:04:24.320> and<00:04:24.830> I'm

00:04:25.360 --> 00:04:25.370 
nail that catch is you could and I'm

00:04:25.370 --> 00:04:26.860 
nail that catch is you could and I'm
starting<00:04:26.000> on<00:04:26.180> this<00:04:26.300> with<00:04:26.450> my<00:04:26.570> right

00:04:26.860 --> 00:04:26.870 
starting on this with my right

00:04:26.870 --> 00:04:29.890 
starting on this with my right
and<00:04:27.020> of<00:04:27.169> course<00:04:27.199> which<00:04:27.910> in<00:04:28.910> retrospect<00:04:29.449> was

00:04:29.890 --> 00:04:29.900 
and of course which in retrospect was

00:04:29.900 --> 00:04:34.510 
and of course which in retrospect was
kind<00:04:30.169> of<00:04:30.290> a<00:04:30.530> silly<00:04:31.100> move<00:04:31.430> on<00:04:31.610> my<00:04:31.760> part<00:04:31.790> but<00:04:33.520> the

00:04:34.510 --> 00:04:34.520 
kind of a silly move on my part but the

00:04:34.520 --> 00:04:36.370 
kind of a silly move on my part but the
reason<00:04:34.669> being<00:04:35.090> that<00:04:35.240> if<00:04:35.750> you<00:04:35.870> do<00:04:36.050> this<00:04:36.199> in

00:04:36.370 --> 00:04:36.380 
reason being that if you do this in

00:04:36.380 --> 00:04:38.710 
reason being that if you do this in
series<00:04:37.160> like<00:04:37.370> that<00:04:37.580> it<00:04:37.760> then<00:04:37.940> sets<00:04:38.330> you<00:04:38.449> up<00:04:38.479> to

00:04:38.710 --> 00:04:38.720 
series like that it then sets you up to

00:04:38.720 --> 00:04:40.480 
series like that it then sets you up to
be<00:04:38.840> able<00:04:38.930> to<00:04:39.110> do<00:04:39.260> a<00:04:39.290> folded<00:04:39.740> line<00:04:39.949> like<00:04:40.190> that

00:04:40.480 --> 00:04:40.490
