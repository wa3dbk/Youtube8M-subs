00:03:58.420 --> 00:03:58.430 
really quick it's good to use a whisk

00:03:58.430 --> 00:03:59.770 
really quick it's good to use a whisk
that<00:03:58.790> way<00:03:58.939> everything's<00:03:59.329> incorporated

00:03:59.770 --> 00:03:59.780 
that way everything's incorporated

00:03:59.780 --> 00:04:03.640 
that way everything's incorporated
really<00:04:00.470> well<00:04:00.680> and<00:04:01.060> then<00:04:02.060> to<00:04:02.269> this<00:04:02.629> because<00:04:03.560> the

00:04:03.640 --> 00:04:03.650 
really well and then to this because the

00:04:03.650 --> 00:04:06.249 
really well and then to this because the
tahini<00:04:04.069> is<00:04:04.220> a<00:04:04.340> thickener<00:04:04.909> so<00:04:05.419> it<00:04:05.540> thickens<00:04:05.989> it

00:04:06.249 --> 00:04:06.259 
tahini is a thickener so it thickens it

00:04:06.259 --> 00:04:10.179 
tahini is a thickener so it thickens it
I'm<00:04:06.829> going<00:04:07.129> to<00:04:07.159> add<00:04:07.400> some<00:04:08.090> water<00:04:08.389> just<00:04:09.189> a

00:04:10.179 --> 00:04:10.189 
I'm going to add some water just a

00:04:10.189 --> 00:04:12.009 
I'm going to add some water just a
little<00:04:10.220> bit<00:04:10.639> and<00:04:10.879> then<00:04:11.000> I'll<00:04:11.090> ask<00:04:11.239> Molly<00:04:11.599> put

00:04:12.009 --> 00:04:12.019 
little bit and then I'll ask Molly put

00:04:12.019 --> 00:04:13.680 
little bit and then I'll ask Molly put
in<00:04:12.109> the<00:04:12.199> pan

00:04:13.680 --> 00:04:13.690 
in the pan

00:04:13.690 --> 00:04:16.320 
in the pan
so<00:04:14.560> the<00:04:15.010> sauce<00:04:15.220> will<00:04:15.460> also<00:04:15.880> think<00:04:16.090> and<00:04:16.209> when

00:04:16.320 --> 00:04:16.330 
so the sauce will also think and when

00:04:16.330 --> 00:04:18.509 
so the sauce will also think and when
you<00:04:16.420> cook<00:04:16.720> it<00:04:16.930> so<00:04:17.380> you<00:04:17.440> don't<00:04:17.860> want<00:04:18.130> it<00:04:18.220> too

00:04:18.509 --> 00:04:18.519 
you cook it so you don't want it too
