00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:00.510 
pretty difficult to actually get it to

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:02.960 
pretty difficult to actually get it to
cross<00:01:00.690> up<00:01:00.870> though<00:01:01.049> yeah<00:01:01.699> that's<00:01:02.699> very<00:01:02.790> true

cross up though yeah that's very true
but<00:01:03.510> you<00:01:03.690> know<00:01:03.780> a<00:01:03.870> lot<00:01:04.080> of<00:01:04.110> people<00:01:04.170> actually

00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:04.530 
but you know a lot of people actually

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:06.740 
but you know a lot of people actually

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:15.030 
it's very unlikely that that we can

Sieg<00:01:30.960> let<00:01:31.109> us<00:01:31.200> see<00:01:31.320> I<00:01:31.530> mean<00:01:32.399> it<00:01:32.490> stands<00:01:32.670> for

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:32.850 
Sieg let us see I mean it stands for

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:34.849 
Sieg let us see I mean it stands for
chip<00:01:33.030> but<00:01:33.539> in<00:01:33.630> alpha<00:01:33.869> three<00:01:34.140> you<00:01:34.590> got<00:01:34.710> a<00:01:34.740> little

00:01:34.849 --> 00:01:34.859 
chip but in alpha three you got a little

00:01:34.859 --> 00:01:36.289 
chip but in alpha three you got a little
cheese<00:01:35.100> so<00:01:35.310> is<00:01:35.520> actually<00:01:35.909> a<00:01:35.939> block<00:01:36.149> of<00:01:36.270> cheese
