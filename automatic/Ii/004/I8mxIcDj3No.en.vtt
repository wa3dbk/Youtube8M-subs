increasing capacity and again a lot of

00:01:44.720 --> 00:01:47.260 
increasing capacity and again a lot of
the<00:01:44.780> same<00:01:44.990> technology<00:01:45.320> of<00:01:46.270> considerably

00:01:47.260 --> 00:01:47.270 
the same technology of considerably

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:49.810 
the same technology of considerably
higher<00:01:47.600> price<00:01:47.960> points<00:01:48.320> exactly<00:01:48.830> one<00:01:49.670> of<00:01:49.760> the

00:01:49.810 --> 00:01:49.820 
higher price points exactly one of the

00:01:49.820 --> 00:01:51.429 
higher price points exactly one of the
differences<00:01:50.330> here<00:01:50.360> is<00:01:50.659> that<00:01:50.810> we<00:01:51.080> have<00:01:51.200> eight

00:01:51.429 --> 00:01:51.439 
differences here is that we have eight

00:01:51.439 --> 00:01:53.620 
differences here is that we have eight
bearings<00:01:51.830> so<00:01:52.369> you<00:01:52.430> get<00:01:52.580> seven<00:01:53.060> stainless

00:01:53.620 --> 00:01:53.630 
bearings so you get seven stainless

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:55.149 
bearings so you get seven stainless
steel<00:01:53.780> ball<00:01:53.960> bearings<00:01:54.350> so<00:01:54.799> if<00:01:54.890> you<00:01:54.979> want<00:01:55.130> to

00:01:55.149 --> 00:01:55.159 
steel ball bearings so if you want to

00:01:55.159 --> 00:01:57.760 
steel ball bearings so if you want to
take<00:01:55.340> it<00:01:55.490> into<00:01:55.640> saltwater<00:01:56.390> you<00:01:56.750> can<00:01:57.409> still<00:01:57.619> do

00:01:57.760 --> 00:01:57.770 
take it into saltwater you can still do

00:01:57.770 --> 00:01:59.710 
take it into saltwater you can still do
that<00:01:57.920> and<00:01:58.310> you<00:01:58.400> know<00:01:58.490> the<00:01:58.640> the<00:01:59.090> Komodos<00:01:59.509> just

00:01:59.710 --> 00:01:59.720 
that and you know the the Komodos just

00:01:59.720 --> 00:02:01.480 
that and you know the the Komodos just
maximized<00:02:00.350> with<00:02:00.590> all<00:02:00.770> that<00:02:00.920> stainless<00:02:01.189> steel

00:02:01.480 --> 00:02:01.490 
maximized with all that stainless steel

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:03.399 
maximized with all that stainless steel
but<00:02:01.700> guys<00:02:02.420> have<00:02:02.570> been<00:02:02.659> taking<00:02:02.930> three<00:02:03.110> hundreds

00:02:03.399 --> 00:02:03.409 
but guys have been taking three hundreds

00:02:03.409 --> 00:02:05.830 
but guys have been taking three hundreds
in<00:02:03.530> salt<00:02:03.830> water<00:02:03.890> for<00:02:04.250> a<00:02:04.280> long<00:02:04.430> time<00:02:04.759> this<00:02:05.659> has

00:02:05.830 --> 00:02:05.840 
in salt water for a long time this has

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:07.539 
in salt water for a long time this has
got<00:02:05.990> very<00:02:06.020> similar<00:02:06.619> features<00:02:06.830> to<00:02:07.280> the<00:02:07.460> other

00:02:07.539 --> 00:02:07.549 
got very similar features to the other

00:02:07.549 --> 00:02:09.639 
got very similar features to the other
reels<00:02:07.790> its<00:02:07.970> competing<00:02:08.360> with<00:02:08.479> a<00:02:08.509> market<00:02:09.019> but

00:02:09.639 --> 00:02:09.649 
reels its competing with a market but

00:02:09.649 --> 00:02:11.830 
reels its competing with a market but
like<00:02:09.799> I<00:02:09.920> said<00:02:10.160> just<00:02:10.190> a<00:02:10.519> much<00:02:11.060> stronger<00:02:11.420> value

00:02:11.830 --> 00:02:11.840 
like I said just a much stronger value

00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:13.270 
like I said just a much stronger value
with<00:02:11.959> some<00:02:12.140> additional<00:02:12.530> features<00:02:12.890> like<00:02:13.100> that

00:02:13.270 --> 00:02:13.280 
with some additional features like that

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:14.650 
with some additional features like that
bait<00:02:13.489> clicker<00:02:13.790> that<00:02:13.970> you<00:02:14.090> don't<00:02:14.239> see<00:02:14.420> on<00:02:14.540> other

00:02:14.650 --> 00:02:14.660 
bait clicker that you don't see on other

00:02:14.660 --> 00:02:16.660 
bait clicker that you don't see on other
reels<00:02:14.989> right<00:02:15.350> you<00:02:15.829> got<00:02:16.010> the<00:02:16.130> eight<00:02:16.280> bearing

00:02:16.660 --> 00:02:16.670 
reels right you got the eight bearing

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:19.030 
reels right you got the eight bearing
drive<00:02:16.910> system<00:02:17.390> I<00:02:17.540> mentioned<00:02:18.290> earlier<00:02:18.980> about

00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:19.040 
drive system I mentioned earlier about

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:21.039 
drive system I mentioned earlier about
the<00:02:19.190> power<00:02:19.489> handle<00:02:19.910> or<00:02:20.060> Komodo<00:02:20.329> well<00:02:20.630> the

00:02:21.039 --> 00:02:21.049 
the power handle or Komodo well the

00:02:21.049 --> 00:02:23.050 
the power handle or Komodo well the
citrix<00:02:21.500> also<00:02:21.890> has<00:02:22.040> the<00:02:22.190> power<00:02:22.370> handle<00:02:22.730> version

00:02:23.050 --> 00:02:23.060 
citrix also has the power handle version

00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:25.330 
citrix also has the power handle version
so<00:02:23.239> you<00:02:23.299> get<00:02:23.540> it<00:02:23.660> with<00:02:24.079> the<00:02:24.230> twin<00:02:24.470> handle<00:02:24.890> or

00:02:25.330 --> 00:02:25.340 
so you get it with the twin handle or

00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:27.460 
so you get it with the twin handle or
the<00:02:25.370> power<00:02:25.760> handle<00:02:26.239> but<00:02:26.870> one<00:02:27.019> thing<00:02:27.230> that<00:02:27.260> the

00:02:27.460 --> 00:02:27.470 
the power handle but one thing that the

00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:29.319 
the power handle but one thing that the
citrix<00:02:27.860> has<00:02:28.040> that<00:02:28.310> the<00:02:28.400> Komodo<00:02:28.700> doesn't<00:02:29.180> is

00:02:29.319 --> 00:02:29.329 
citrix has that the Komodo doesn't is

00:02:29.329 --> 00:02:30.699 
citrix has that the Komodo doesn't is
that<00:02:29.360> it<00:02:29.600> offers<00:02:29.989> two<00:02:30.170> different<00:02:30.200> gear<00:02:30.590> ratios

00:02:30.699 --> 00:02:30.709 
that it offers two different gear ratios

00:02:30.709 --> 00:02:33.100 
that it offers two different gear ratios
okay<00:02:31.280> you<00:02:31.730> hit<00:02:31.880> the<00:02:32.030> standard<00:02:32.480> six<00:02:32.720> point<00:02:32.959> four

00:02:33.100 --> 00:02:33.110 
okay you hit the standard six point four

00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:35.560 
okay you hit the standard six point four
to<00:02:33.260> 1<00:02:33.380> gear<00:02:33.530> ratio<00:02:33.590> you'd<00:02:34.549> also<00:02:34.700> get<00:02:34.940> a<00:02:35.000> 5<00:02:35.299> point

00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:35.570 
to 1 gear ratio you'd also get a 5 point

00:02:35.570 --> 00:02:37.659 
to 1 gear ratio you'd also get a 5 point
4<00:02:35.780> to<00:02:35.900> 1<00:02:36.049> gear<00:02:36.230> ratio<00:02:36.260> really<00:02:37.040> cranking<00:02:37.400> so

00:02:37.659 --> 00:02:37.669 
4 to 1 gear ratio really cranking so

00:02:37.669 --> 00:02:39.370 
4 to 1 gear ratio really cranking so
there's<00:02:37.850> a<00:02:37.910> big<00:02:38.060> trend<00:02:38.419> not<00:02:38.750> just<00:02:39.049> for<00:02:39.200> fresh

00:02:39.370 --> 00:02:39.380 
there's a big trend not just for fresh

00:02:39.380 --> 00:02:41.020 
there's a big trend not just for fresh
