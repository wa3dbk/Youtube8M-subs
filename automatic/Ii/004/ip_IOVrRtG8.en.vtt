00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:38.190
 cool videos and more technical speaking 

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:40.680
 it's a brilliant thing on the part of 

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:43.230
 mainly producers of rockstar 

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:44.850
 I love this kind of thing because it does 

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:47.550
 the players stay company somebody 

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:50.579
 even after they have generated the campaign 

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:53.010
 looking game externally and easter 

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:54.390
 eggs is good for the producer and is good for 

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:57.030

 best terex inject game will go 

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:11.939
 we can find a car that does 

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:14.880
 reference to a movie back to the future 

00:01:11.939 --> 00:01:17.640
 And the cool thing is that this movie has reference 

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:21.420
 in all that is play several games do 

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:22.950
 reference to this movie and gta will if not 

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:25.409
 it's different you might be finding 

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:27.900
 a car that contains the same color and is 

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:31.140
 much like the movie car 

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:34.490
 time was really cool and with 

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:37.590
 sure a great reference to the movie 

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:40.079
 gta goes if it was released during the 

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:41.850
 Easter and rockstar did her homage to 

00:01:40.079 --> 00:01:44.640
 so if you live in this building here not 

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:47.070
 such you can find a part of the 

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:48.149
 that she is half-Bulgarian and so 

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:49.920
 What do you jump? 

00:01:48.149 --> 00:01:53.130

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:19.319
 Building throws some water, guys, this is 

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:21.989
 It's very strange to throw a 

00:02:19.319 --> 00:02:24.530
 I do not even need to say that the references 

00:02:21.989 --> 00:02:24.530

00:02:43.739 --> 00:02:48.329

00:03:30.130 --> 00:03:35.260
 in the game we can also find 

00:03:32.350 --> 00:03:37.420
 a reference to a porn actress who comes up 

00:03:35.260 --> 00:03:40.090

 person 

00:04:08.380 --> 00:04:13.180
 You do not even need to tell her what she's doing. 

00:04:09.790 --> 00:04:16.840
 and more photos of cards and strange 

00:04:13.180 --> 00:04:20.770

 Scarface if you do not see this 

00:04:26.680 --> 00:04:28.840
 home here 

00:04:27.580 --> 00:04:31.120
 from the moment you enter 

00:04:28.840 --> 00:04:33.900
 inside it and jumps in the bathroom 

00:04:31.120 --> 00:04:36.520
 You will see the reference has a 

00:04:33.900 --> 00:04:38.170
 bathtub full of blood on the wall and 

00:04:36.520 --> 00:04:40.690
 who watched the movie knows how to do 

00:04:38.170 --> 00:04:45.480
 reference to the friend of the protagonist who 

00:04:40.690 --> 00:04:47.830

 I was hidden in the studios us 

00:05:08.620 --> 00:05:12.880

00:05:11.260 --> 00:05:15.490
 treats something as if it were 

00:05:12.880 --> 00:05:17.920
