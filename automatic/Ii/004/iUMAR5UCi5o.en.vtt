00:00:05.009 --> 00:00:08.639
 little thing is to make all conversations 

00:00:07.350 --> 00:00:10.050
 from washington 

00:00:08.639 --> 00:00:13.040
 once a time is complete the 

00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:16.120
 game will appear here 

00:00:13.040 --> 00:00:16.120
 it's the side of the map 

00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:23.230
 I am wrong about the vote 

00:00:20.170 --> 00:00:25.550
 be down here in new york this 

00:00:23.230 --> 00:00:28.720
 talk to him 

00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:28.720
 says playing petanque 

00:00:29.600 --> 00:00:34.380
 and we'll see that then where we can 

00:00:32.689 --> 00:00:36.510
 find him 

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:37.830
 to be able to complete it because it does not 

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:40.730
 appears nowhere else only 

00:00:37.830 --> 00:00:44.180
 here we have to go 

00:00:40.730 --> 00:00:47.450
 also to be older than DNA we are going to 

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:49.750
 sequence 9 and we repeat the first 

00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:49.750
 mission 

00:00:51.050 --> 00:00:56.600
 because I do not know why the game made this 

00:00:54.230 --> 00:00:59.950
 I was like crazy looking for the uncle 

00:00:56.600 --> 00:01:02.880

00:00:59.950 --> 00:01:02.880
 Common 

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:32.450
 appear here 

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:32.450
 commander the scene we removed him 

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:48.310
 and well, go back to church 

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:51.020
 abandoned but we're not going to do that 

00:01:48.310 --> 00:01:54.020
 we have to go up here where he puts the 

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:56.090
 Washington and talk to him several 

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:59.360
 I have already spoken and I already have it 

00:01:56.090 --> 00:02:03.690
 but you go and talk 

00:01:59.360 --> 00:02:06.440
 with him two or three times and they will give him 

00:02:03.690 --> 00:02:06.440
 the challenge 

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:12.640
 I was looking for looking and the bastards 

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:16.240

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:18.510

00:02:16.240 --> 00:02:18.510
 with the 

00:02:22.850 --> 00:02:28.940
 commander I have failed them with there is only 

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:31.740
 to look around to see the first 

00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:34.590
 I jump because I 've seen it 

00:02:31.740 --> 00:02:37.430
 and you can start walking around here and 

00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:37.430

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:45.770
 and I will give you the challenge 

00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:50.330

00:02:45.770 --> 00:02:52.100

00:02:50.330 --> 00:02:53.480
