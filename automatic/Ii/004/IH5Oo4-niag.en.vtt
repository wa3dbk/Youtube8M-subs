 What is there aquarium people? Fishtanktv.com dustinsfishtanks brings it to you on a Friday. Gotta be a little quiet because both the girls are sleeping up the stairs but having a good time. Crushed it all week long. Found some of the people watching work. If you look at this while you are at work. Get a life! Go do something. Don't you have something to do? Do you not have to install a telephone? Anyway here is what's going on. I want to show you a little up. My husband Zac, who ordered a nice thick order of aquatic jungles, asked how to spread Amazon Sword as she was a runner. I have seven different leaves scares an Amazon Sword mother that I have received. Here's how I like to do it. Look there is no exact science. I'm just gonna tell you how I do it. For me it's all about if there is a bit of root growth there, so if this is root growth here. Roots are how plants eat, so I use dirt. I want to make sure they can eat the dirt. So I would do that I wait until they have grown. This is more than enough root growth to really plant in the bottom of a tank. This one is actually bigger, but the roots aren't that big. I will still use this. What I have done is that I just cut the stem and I don't know if the plant can actually absorb through that stem, or if I just go through that root there. But I would go ahead and plant it and this one. That little runner I'm gonna leave there. If you don't see beautiful runners with roots, you would plant that if you were desperate, but I suggest they grow and just really develop some nice roots, if they are connected to the mother plant. Here's how you do it. I am going to try and do this with one hand. This is going to be tough, but here's what we do. We just take it and grab it like this. Just the end and just some sort of let it guide down there. Just like that! Put it in there. I have no problem with having a bit of gravel over the actual leaves and a little bit like in the trunk. Because it's just making it down there. What we are going to do and what I like to do is that I like to keep an eye on things like the tinniest growth on there, and just really keep an eye on that one. For this plant my reference point is the small brown leaf in the middle there. I'm going to explain on it, if you can see that. I do it on this tank mainly because lights from this tank are so freaking bad ass. I was like daydreaming to think about how I am going to beef all these tanks. Here's what I say: if you like a very small growth. Find a specific leaf or a specific place on the plant and watch that part. I'll bring it back in another video about how that magazine does. This goes to the one in no time. That is just like how I gauge it. I want that and I've kind of got a little handiness, I think it's a good way to measure how the plant is doing. The plants tell you the story people! Just look at the plants. Many people spend a lot of time testing the water, you know "Dustin what is my pH", all these questions are the chemistry. Just look at the plants, they will tell you the story. In that regard, I want to show you what's going on here in my least sexy tank. This tank has no chance compared to those who have the better lighting on them. I don't know if I'm going high outputs of this or not just like that. But what I have done is that I float a forest of Java, because it is a very hardy plant and can handle the abuse, but I have put in some plants here that can't handle the abuse: liguigia matures. It is a no no! Don't put it in a freshly dirted tank. In some here I just have to see you sort of what is going to happen. I've done it before and I've cooked some, but I've put in some Jungle Val. Now one of the things that many rookies have commented on. It is worth noting that they will plant Jungle Fall and will like "Oh dude, it all went away", but again you need to focus on the little bit you grow. I'm going to show you here, so down here. We've got the tiny growth. That is what you want to focus on, because these leaves are made for a different tank. They are made for a different setup, so you leave them because they still probably do the plant well. If they are really ready, you would cut them off, but that new growth is a good sign. That is all you need. For me with this tank being dirted a week or so ago, that's for me going forward like adding more stronger species, so I'm going to move on a move a bunch of jungle traps here and this thing really rock. By the way check this out, I have this right here which is as amazing when it comes to refreshing water. Then I got these two here, and let's see if I can do this while on the camera. I am a sucker trap. I said it! That was bad. I have that on my mouth. Did i get it? No I don't, but still see what I do. I got the trap down here in the drain, draining and filling at the same time. It is money! So that's what's the matter. Dirt in a tank, go slowly, change your water. I'm going to do another one. I mean, I have to. Also something to watch with a dirted tank is the duckweed. Some of the kind bleached down and died, but it grew back that way. So that you can see kind of the different colors. This stuff looks healthier than the others. Duckweed is such a hardy plant. It's good for a dirted tank. I would really recommend adding a lot to your dirted tank. That's what's going on. Shout out to all the new subscribers and I got to say one more thing. I have to say rest in pieces to the original fishtanktv laptop. I'm going to miss you Gateway, $ 1,500 five years ago when I pissed money during the mortgage boom. So it finally died! We put a lot of memories in a lot of videos. Videos in principle 1 to 400 were made on that machine, so a moment of silence for my boy. Anyway, I replaced it with a thick HP for 600 $ so that's it. I got a number of sundays for you this weekend as well. Later!
