right guess what with the power of
editing<00:02:45.370> we<00:02:46.090> are<00:02:46.360> done<00:02:47.260> with<00:02:47.410> the<00:02:47.590> floor<00:02:47.920> and

00:02:48.210 --> 00:02:48.220 
editing we are done with the floor and

00:02:48.220 --> 00:02:50.790 
editing we are done with the floor and
now<00:02:48.820> we<00:02:49.239> can<00:02:49.450> start<00:02:49.570> doing<00:02:49.900> the<00:02:50.140> wall<00:02:50.350> so<00:02:50.680> now

00:02:50.790 --> 00:02:50.800 
now we can start doing the wall so now

finish off the roof going like that or

00:05:16.760 --> 00:05:20.290 
finish off the roof going like that or
you<00:05:17.750> can<00:05:17.900> just<00:05:18.020> leave<00:05:18.500> it<00:05:18.530> how<00:05:18.770> it<00:05:18.800> is<00:05:19.210> you<00:05:20.210> know

00:05:20.290 --> 00:05:20.300 
you can just leave it how it is you know

00:05:20.300 --> 00:05:24.750 
you can just leave it how it is you know
and<00:05:20.420> just<00:05:20.480> make<00:05:20.690> it<00:05:21.430> flat<00:05:22.430> on<00:05:22.790> the<00:05:23.240> roof<00:05:23.420> but

00:05:24.750 --> 00:05:24.760 
and just make it flat on the roof but

00:05:24.760 --> 00:05:28.960 
and just make it flat on the roof but
anyway<00:05:25.760> I<00:05:26.740> just<00:05:27.740> broke<00:05:28.280> a<00:05:28.340> block<00:05:28.640> I<00:05:28.670> didn't

00:05:28.960 --> 00:05:28.970 
anyway I just broke a block I didn't

00:05:28.970 --> 00:05:29.590 
anyway I just broke a block I didn't
mean<00:05:29.120> to

00:05:29.590 --> 00:05:29.600 
mean to

00:05:29.600 --> 00:05:36.030 
mean to
nope<00:05:30.320> alright<00:05:31.960> and<00:05:32.960> then<00:05:33.140> after<00:05:33.650> you<00:05:33.890> have

00:05:36.030 --> 00:05:36.040 
nope alright and then after you have

00:05:36.040 --> 00:05:43.030 
nope alright and then after you have
this<00:05:37.040> part<00:05:37.400> doing<00:05:39.730> well<00:05:40.870> this<00:05:41.870> fell<00:05:42.170> all<00:05:42.920> right

00:05:43.030 --> 00:05:43.040 
this part doing well this fell all right

00:05:43.040 --> 00:05:47.800 
this part doing well this fell all right
so<00:05:43.700> then<00:05:43.850> you<00:05:43.880> can<00:05:44.210> just<00:05:44.950> basically<00:05:46.450> just<00:05:47.450> put

00:05:47.800 --> 00:05:47.810 
so then you can just basically just put

00:05:47.810 --> 00:05:51.280 
so then you can just basically just put
everything<00:05:49.060> connecting<00:05:50.060> it<00:05:50.180> all<00:05:50.270> up<00:05:50.480> fishing

00:05:51.280 --> 00:05:51.290

00:06:28.900 --> 00:06:28.910 
as am is you know wiring of some sort

00:06:28.910 --> 00:06:30.520 
as am is you know wiring of some sort
and<00:06:29.030> it<00:06:29.180> go<00:06:29.540> like<00:06:29.750> that<00:06:30.020> and<00:06:30.230> they<00:06:30.290> go<00:06:30.410> like

00:06:32.830 --> 00:06:32.840 
that it looks pretty good

00:06:32.840 --> 00:06:35.050 
that it looks pretty good
fences<00:06:33.530> are<00:06:33.560> pretty<00:06:33.919> good<00:06:34.100> for<00:06:34.340> like<00:06:34.460> wiring

00:06:35.050 --> 00:06:35.060 
fences are pretty good for like wiring

00:06:35.060 --> 00:06:38.200 
fences are pretty good for like wiring
you<00:06:35.750> know<00:06:35.870> this<00:06:36.440> looks<00:06:36.680> pretty<00:06:36.980> nice<00:06:37.100> and<00:06:37.520> then

00:06:38.200 --> 00:06:38.210 
you know this looks pretty nice and then

00:06:38.210 --> 00:06:39.670 
you know this looks pretty nice and then
we're<00:06:38.720> not<00:06:38.840> going<00:06:39.140> to<00:06:39.200> keep

00:06:39.670 --> 00:06:39.680 
we're not going to keep

00:06:39.680 --> 00:06:42.550 
we're not going to keep
so<00:06:39.889> don't<00:06:40.100> worry<00:06:40.310> but<00:06:41.080> anyway<00:06:42.080> you're<00:06:42.500> gonna

00:06:42.550 --> 00:06:42.560 
so don't worry but anyway you're gonna

00:06:42.560 --> 00:06:46.689 
so don't worry but anyway you're gonna
put<00:06:42.830> your<00:06:42.889> fence<00:06:43.160> gates<00:06:43.630> up<00:06:44.630> top<00:06:45.110> like<00:06:45.699> that

00:06:46.689 --> 00:06:46.699 
put your fence gates up top like that

00:06:46.699 --> 00:06:51.610 
put your fence gates up top like that
close<00:06:47.660> them<00:06:47.900> and<00:06:49.539> then<00:06:50.539> presumably<00:06:50.930> this

00:06:51.610 --> 00:06:51.620 
close them and then presumably this

00:06:51.620 --> 00:06:54.879 
close them and then presumably this
would<00:06:52.130> open<00:06:52.370> it<00:06:52.639> close<00:06:52.910> and<00:06:53.380> then<00:06:54.380> you<00:06:54.410> just

00:06:54.879 --> 00:06:54.889 
would open it close and then you just

00:06:54.889 --> 00:06:59.189 
would open it close and then you just
put<00:06:55.310> these<00:06:55.810> up<00:06:57.100> doo-doo-doo

00:06:59.189 --> 00:06:59.199 
put these up doo-doo-doo

00:06:59.199 --> 00:07:05.710 
put these up doo-doo-doo
now<00:07:00.400> you<00:07:01.400> can<00:07:01.580> actually<00:07:01.729> go<00:07:02.120> like<00:07:02.300> that<00:07:04.720> now

00:07:05.710 --> 00:07:05.720 
now you can actually go like that now

00:07:05.720 --> 00:07:07.360 
now you can actually go like that now
they're<00:07:05.870> connecting<00:07:06.380> and<00:07:06.770> that<00:07:06.979> looks<00:07:07.130> good

00:07:07.360 --> 00:07:07.370 
they're connecting and that looks good

00:07:07.370 --> 00:07:10.870 
they're connecting and that looks good
so<00:07:07.580> now<00:07:09.190> now<00:07:10.190> we're<00:07:10.310> gonna<00:07:10.400> make<00:07:10.610> it<00:07:10.729> look<00:07:10.820> like

00:07:10.870 --> 00:07:10.880 
so now now we're gonna make it look like

00:07:10.880 --> 00:07:14.260 
so now now we're gonna make it look like
this<00:07:11.810> is<00:07:12.039> opening<00:07:13.039> and<00:07:13.220> closing<00:07:13.669> or<00:07:13.850> it<00:07:14.030> could

00:07:14.260 --> 00:07:14.270 
this is opening and closing or it could

00:07:14.270 --> 00:07:17.050 
this is opening and closing or it could
open<00:07:14.419> it<00:07:14.630> close<00:07:14.919> with<00:07:15.919> these<00:07:16.160> with<00:07:16.940> these

00:07:17.050 --> 00:07:17.060 
open it close with these with these

00:07:17.060 --> 00:07:24.000 
open it close with these with these
doors<00:07:18.520> that<00:07:19.520> we're<00:07:19.820> putting<00:07:20.180> down<00:07:20.300> right<00:07:20.630> now
