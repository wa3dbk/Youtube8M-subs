00:02:09.529 --> 00:02:09.539 
up this you'll have to extract all these

00:02:09.539 --> 00:02:12.140 
up this you'll have to extract all these
themes<00:02:09.780> from<00:02:10.080> the<00:02:10.170> apk<00:02:10.800> I<00:02:10.830> take<00:02:11.160> it

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:12.150 
themes from the apk I take it

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:15.530 
themes from the apk I take it
and<00:02:12.540> it<00:02:12.690> does<00:02:12.870> do<00:02:13.080> that<00:02:13.670> fairly<00:02:14.670> fast<00:02:15.030> and<00:02:15.390> then

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:15.540 
and it does do that fairly fast and then

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:16.940 
and it does do that fairly fast and then
he<00:02:15.629> can<00:02:15.750> also<00:02:15.870> download<00:02:16.230> the<00:02:16.560> full<00:02:16.769> online

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:16.950 
he can also download the full online

00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:20.690 
he can also download the full online
collection<00:02:17.670> which<00:02:18.390> is<00:02:18.569> why<00:02:18.690> I<00:02:18.720> have<00:02:18.959> done<00:02:19.700> so

00:02:20.690 --> 00:02:20.700 
collection which is why I have done so

00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:22.070 
collection which is why I have done so

00:02:43.460 --> 00:02:43.470 
see they're all seem to be very high

00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:44.930 
see they're all seem to be very high
resolution<00:02:44.280> and<00:02:44.430> they<00:02:44.549> look<00:02:44.730> great

00:02:44.930 --> 00:02:44.940 
resolution and they look great

00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:47.330 
resolution and they look great
especially<00:02:45.150> this<00:02:45.599> one<00:02:45.810> they<00:02:46.470> establish<00:02:47.220> the

00:02:47.330 --> 00:02:47.340 
especially this one they establish the

00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:50.420 
especially this one they establish the
time<00:02:47.609> to<00:02:47.940> date<00:02:48.180> the<00:02:48.870> weather<00:02:49.160> which<00:02:50.160> we<00:02:50.280> can

00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:50.430 
time to date the weather which we can

00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:53.089 
time to date the weather which we can
change<00:02:50.609> the<00:02:50.790> Fahrenheit<00:02:51.180> if<00:02:51.299> we<00:02:51.450> want<00:02:51.629> and<00:02:52.590> the

00:02:53.089 --> 00:02:53.099 
change the Fahrenheit if we want and the

00:02:53.099 --> 00:02:55.369 
change the Fahrenheit if we want and the
percentage<00:02:53.579> of<00:02:53.790> my<00:02:53.940> battery<00:02:54.180> has<00:02:54.450> left<00:02:54.690> and

00:02:55.369 --> 00:02:55.379 
percentage of my battery has left and

00:02:55.379 --> 00:02:57.470 
percentage of my battery has left and
like<00:02:55.500> I<00:02:55.680> said<00:02:55.739> the<00:02:56.069> free<00:02:56.280> version<00:02:56.730> apparently

00:02:57.470 --> 00:02:57.480 
like I said the free version apparently

00:02:57.480 --> 00:02:59.149 
like I said the free version apparently
doesn't<00:02:57.780> support<00:02:58.170> anything<00:02:58.620> over<00:02:58.980> which

00:02:59.149 --> 00:02:59.159 
doesn't support anything over which

00:02:59.159 --> 00:03:00.589 
doesn't support anything over which
decides<00:02:59.489> off<00:02:59.640> with<00:02:59.760> a<00:02:59.849> 4x2

00:03:00.589 --> 00:03:00.599 
decides off with a 4x2

00:03:00.599 --> 00:03:04.130 
decides off with a 4x2
but<00:03:01.500> the<00:03:01.620> paid<00:03:02.489> version<00:03:02.879> does<00:03:03.030> you<00:03:03.989> can

00:03:04.130 --> 00:03:04.140 
but the paid version does you can

00:03:04.140 --> 00:03:06.680 
but the paid version does you can
changes<00:03:04.739> actually<00:03:04.920> and<00:03:05.340> I<00:03:05.459> don't<00:03:05.579> know<00:03:05.730> no<00:03:06.659> no

00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:06.690 
changes actually and I don't know no no

00:03:06.690 --> 00:03:08.869 
changes actually and I don't know no no
I'm<00:03:07.079> not<00:03:07.230> promoting<00:03:07.560> this<00:03:07.829> by<00:03:08.040> he<00:03:08.310> means<00:03:08.519> put

00:03:08.869 --> 00:03:08.879 
I'm not promoting this by he means put

00:03:08.879 --> 00:03:11.690 
I'm not promoting this by he means put
on<00:03:09.030> if<00:03:09.780> you're<00:03:09.959> on<00:03:10.049> Ice<00:03:10.200> Cream<00:03:10.440> Sandwich<00:03:10.700> you

00:03:11.690 --> 00:03:11.700

00:03:11.700 --> 00:03:15.080 
on if you're on Ice Cream Sandwich you
can<00:03:12.000> resize<00:03:12.690> the<00:03:13.349> widget<00:03:13.530> anyway<00:03:14.069> and<00:03:14.250> the

00:03:15.080 --> 00:03:15.090 
can resize the widget anyway and the

00:03:15.090 --> 00:03:17.379 
can resize the widget anyway and the
widget<00:03:15.359> will<00:03:15.480> ultimately<00:03:16.049> change<00:03:16.349> size

00:03:17.379 --> 00:03:17.389 
widget will ultimately change size

00:03:17.389 --> 00:03:20.870 
widget will ultimately change size
according<00:03:18.389> to<00:03:18.419> how<00:03:18.720> big<00:03:19.040> you<00:03:20.040> you<00:03:20.669> know<00:03:20.819> you

00:03:20.870 --> 00:03:20.880 
according to how big you you know you

00:03:20.880 --> 00:03:25.640 
according to how big you you know you
changed<00:03:21.540> the<00:03:21.599> widget<00:03:22.639> so<00:03:23.639> yeah<00:03:24.630> it<00:03:25.319> seems

00:03:25.640 --> 00:03:25.650 
changed the widget so yeah it seems

00:03:25.650 --> 00:03:28.430 
changed the widget so yeah it seems
slightly<00:03:25.889> odd<00:03:26.450> but<00:03:27.450> the<00:03:27.629> saying<00:03:27.870> that<00:03:28.019> yeah

00:03:28.430 --> 00:03:28.440 
slightly odd but the saying that yeah

00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:30.199
