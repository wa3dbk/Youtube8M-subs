00:00:01.220 --> 00:00:05.520
 what are my friends and sincerely 

00:00:03.810 --> 00:00:07.319
 Welcome to the first episode 

00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:09.599
 still and today we have the theme here 

00:00:07.319 --> 00:00:11.849
 as you conditionally I say with intention 

00:00:09.599 --> 00:00:14.250
 Conditionally 1 vc course can handle 

00:00:11.849 --> 00:00:16.260
 Of course , this is about the team Vc Bahn 

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:17.970
 Of course steam is logical and everyone 

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:20.699
 the one steam account knows that one 

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:23.220
 steam vc can be banished and man 

00:00:20.699 --> 00:00:25.289
 can only be banned at special games 

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:27.150
 that is, if you just play 

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:28.590
 and decided like some of us 

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:30.929
 stop then you will either 

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:32.399
 completely account for cee banned or it 

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:34.380
 only your game will be banned 

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:36.420
 and if only your game is banned 

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:38.010
 Of course you can remedy that 

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:39.660
 and I'll be in the next five 

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:41.670
 Easily explain minutes as you do 

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:43.230
 Let's just take me as 

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:44.700
 For example, at that time I was in 

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:46.800
 black ops two spellbound because i have one 

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:47.850
 pistols script for the mouse had well 

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:49.140
 it is not really a script 

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:50.520
 but a macro I have a marco 

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:52.079
 keyboard and I just got that 

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:53.760
 set that in my options 

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:55.140
 I leave my marco button pressed and 

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:56.850
 he starts the pistol counting directly 

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:58.530
 he really is not 

00:00:56.850 --> 00:01:00.809
 send or I just have a mark 

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:02.579
 per keyboard or mouse and would like this 

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:03.149
 also use accordingly 

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:04.769
 gamble 

00:01:03.149 --> 00:01:06.299
 otherwise I would have the 100 euro for the 

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:08.010
 keyboard can save or not 

00:01:06.299 --> 00:01:10.170
 yes in any case, I was then vrc 

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:13.200
 banned in black ops 2 only in black ops 

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:14.369
 2 That means in my account is synonymous 

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:15.840
 not in it that I look at two 

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:18.360
 if I am with my mine 

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:19.740
 account log in and look up 

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:21.020
 two pulled stands then this account was 

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:23.520
 permanently locked 

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:25.500
 for marco keyboard use something like that 

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:27.450
 is handicapped or now there is one 

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:30.270
 very simple way against it my 

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:31.710
 friends and that you know yes 

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:32.430
 all determines the team familyfair 

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:34.650
 program 

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:37.020
 yes it really works at only 

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:39.630
 that works 

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:41.610
 this would have a steam family &amp; cher 

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:42.780
 Join group and that means you can 

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:45.240
 then if you are in the program 

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:47.159
 have been taken up all yours 

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:48.990
 library with five different people 

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:51.060
 sharon that is from your family your 

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:52.890
 friends or anything else and these 

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:54.570
 can then turn to another account 

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:56.610
 access your games 

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:57.750
 and now this is for some 

00:01:56.610 --> 00:01:59.130
 this works for some 

00:01:57.750 --> 00:02:00.180
 that does not work that way 

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:02.460
 just had to try it 

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:04.320
 So with me, for example, in mw3 I have 

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:06.090
 then properly hacked so for the good 

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:07.590
 i really have all the titles in the 

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:09.600
 was playing I have frozen I 

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:10.920
 killed and then I have the whole round 

00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:12.390
 made immortal and become 

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:14.160
 really fun so the players 

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:15.330
 also had a lot of fun with me though 

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:18.450
 I turned off all the titles like that 

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:19.860
 but no matter where you are turned 

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:21.990
 the circle became Shiites in black ops 2 

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:23.670
 I was spellbound so I was just about 

00:02:21.990 --> 00:02:27.140
 mp3s also spotted in my account 

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:29.880
 with a vcb black ops 2 namely not 

00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:31.080
 look at the ice only vehicles tape if 

00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:32.130
 I log into the game 

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:34.200
 then it's time to call me 

00:02:32.130 --> 00:02:35.340
 Duty is more open-minded than follow that 

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:37.200
 I want to fall in this style 

00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:38.520
 military program no thing and have with 

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:40.380
 made a new account and just got it 

00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:42.660
 shared my library with myself 

00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:43.830
 So with my new account, yes and 

00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:45.180
 then I thought at some point 

00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:46.230
 Just look at it again 

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:47.760
 you look round if you can 

00:02:46.230 --> 00:02:49.560
 I know one of the black ops 

00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:51.360
 best call of duty series for me 

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:52.709
 player for me and I have then 

00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:54.360
 and I logged it in and it 

00:02:52.709 --> 00:02:55.800
 Actually, of course, I started 

00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:57.570
 again at 1 then but I can so my 

00:02:55.800 --> 00:02:59.940
 men countess banned in black ops 2 

00:02:57.570 --> 00:03:01.290
 but the other account is not 

00:02:59.940 --> 00:03:03.170
 so I planned my new account 

00:03:01.290 --> 00:03:06.060
 with the steam familyfair program 

00:03:03.170 --> 00:03:07.980
 did not banned that means 

00:03:06.060 --> 00:03:09.450
 I can again play officially normal 

00:03:07.980 --> 00:03:11.760
 but found 11 or everything 

00:03:09.450 --> 00:03:13.500
 but that's not so bad 

00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:16.530
 the whole diaz and stuff are too 

00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:17.549
 Everything must be considered in this 

00:03:16.530 --> 00:03:19.140
 steam family scheer 

00:03:17.549 --> 00:03:20.519
 I always explain the whole thing to you like it 

00:03:19.140 --> 00:03:21.239
 works as for the people who own it 

00:03:20.519 --> 00:03:24.450
 do not know yet 

00:03:21.239 --> 00:03:26.250
 that does not mean of course now 

00:03:24.450 --> 00:03:29.880
 like crazy and then it does or something 

00:03:26.250 --> 00:03:31.500
 no hackers are all son of a bitch though 

00:03:29.880 --> 00:03:34.860
 You may call it that or yes 

00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:36.810
 Hackers are all fuckers the little one 

00:03:34.860 --> 00:03:38.700
 penis and so have their micro penis 

00:03:36.810 --> 00:03:40.769
 want to compensate complexly 

00:03:38.700 --> 00:03:42.180
 ok, I explain all the time you are looking for 

00:03:40.769 --> 00:03:44.310
 just join the team a specific group 

00:03:42.180 --> 00:03:45.780
 that means family &amp; cher if you like that 

00:03:44.310 --> 00:03:47.370
 you have made the whole group talk 

00:03:45.780 --> 00:03:50.430
 and just write in this group 

00:03:47.370 --> 00:03:52.140
 in white medleys to the stream solemnly 

00:03:50.430 --> 00:03:53.549
 is cher program or something in the art 

00:03:52.140 --> 00:03:54.870
 I'll see because there are a thousand 

00:03:53.549 --> 00:03:56.730
 Make other people on the day too 

00:03:54.870 --> 00:03:58.440
 At that time I still have two or three 

00:03:56.730 --> 00:03:59.160
 lasted days then I had my far 

00:03:58.440 --> 00:04:01.200
 by e mail 

00:03:59.160 --> 00:04:02.699
 and I could stop myself there 

00:04:01.200 --> 00:04:03.460
 I had to stephen beta client 

00:04:02.699 --> 00:04:06.010
 has downloaded 

00:04:03.460 --> 00:04:07.840
 Everything automatically done in the course 

00:04:06.010 --> 00:04:09.250
 this steam family cher e mail 

00:04:07.840 --> 00:04:11.680
 and then I could just come with me 

00:04:09.250 --> 00:04:13.300
 my other account is yours 

00:04:11.680 --> 00:04:14.170
 just with an account on the pc 

00:04:13.300 --> 00:04:15.850
 the library was logged in 

00:04:14.170 --> 00:04:18.100
 hoofed and is its own is 

00:04:15.850 --> 00:04:20.170
 skoda nasdaq another account directly in 

00:04:18.100 --> 00:04:24.040
 your settings in there and can there 

00:04:20.170 --> 00:04:25.360
 the pc released or the account if 

00:04:24.040 --> 00:04:26.920
 you then often have a new one around loks 

00:04:25.360 --> 00:04:30.490
 account and do you have all the games there 

00:04:26.920 --> 00:04:32.620
 what you do what you do before 

00:04:30.490 --> 00:04:35.470
 the team has to activate it well 

00:04:32.620 --> 00:04:37.180
 So that his order to the garden needs 

00:04:35.470 --> 00:04:39.400
 money comes there is no dream 

00:04:37.180 --> 00:04:41.320
 yes and then you can with your other 

00:04:39.400 --> 00:04:43.480
 account your whole library well 

00:04:41.320 --> 00:04:45.010
 at least almost the whole library all 

00:04:43.480 --> 00:04:48.280
 games are not integrated yet 

00:04:45.010 --> 00:04:50.230
 there is still a beta working there 

00:04:48.280 --> 00:04:52.360
 still on it but partly it works 

00:04:50.230 --> 00:04:54.280
 with a few friends who can 

00:04:52.360 --> 00:04:55.000
 do that with css if they are in css 

00:04:54.280 --> 00:04:56.560
 are banned 

00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:57.640
 on another account you can 

00:04:56.560 --> 00:04:58.060
 play again now because they are free there 

00:04:57.640 --> 00:05:00.220
 are 

00:04:58.060 --> 00:05:03.820
 it really depends on whether one 

00:05:00.220 --> 00:05:07.060
 have or hard vrc ground if its just a 

00:05:03.820 --> 00:05:07.990
 I know about the vcs game 

00:05:07.060 --> 00:05:09.760
 not if he is in any case only in the 

00:05:07.990 --> 00:05:11.050
 You are free to play this game 

00:05:09.760 --> 00:05:12.520
 Play your other account again 

00:05:11.050 --> 00:05:14.680
 if he has that on the new account 

00:05:12.520 --> 00:05:16.240
 it's not over here so to speak 

00:05:14.680 --> 00:05:17.710
 the old one log data but I have 

00:05:16.240 --> 00:05:19.240
 really new you are really new then 

00:05:17.710 --> 00:05:20.740
 is really how tell the game 

00:05:19.240 --> 00:05:23.530
 then you bought new what you to yours 

00:05:20.740 --> 00:05:25.360
 other library then plays yes and 

00:05:23.530 --> 00:05:26.500
 that was it so easy 

00:05:25.360 --> 00:05:28.870
 is that my friends 

00:05:26.500 --> 00:05:30.010
 it definitely works conditionally 

00:05:28.870 --> 00:05:31.030
 but i hope i could catch you with that 

00:05:30.010 --> 00:05:32.590
 help a little further there is yes 

00:05:31.030 --> 00:05:34.570
 really like people like me when i'm in 

00:05:32.590 --> 00:05:36.280
 look at two because of macro using it okay 

00:05:34.570 --> 00:05:38.260
 is clearly unfair advantage but me 

00:05:36.280 --> 00:05:40.300
 Got it all around, what should not I do 

00:05:38.260 --> 00:05:41.590
 Spend money on an expensive keyboard 

00:05:40.300 --> 00:05:43.570
 if I know then not used 

00:05:41.590 --> 00:05:45.340
 you are so weak so I think 

00:05:43.570 --> 00:05:46.600
 that's banned okay I can already 

00:05:45.340 --> 00:05:48.100
 Somewhere somewhere something understands 

00:05:46.600 --> 00:05:51.040
 Imperator advantage when I gamble 

00:05:48.100 --> 00:05:52.720
 had it all I think would halt 

00:05:51.040 --> 00:05:55.230
 i didnt think i was using for macro 

00:05:52.720 --> 00:05:57.220
 banned for that 

00:05:55.230 --> 00:05:58.240
 I thank you for watching my 

00:05:57.220 --> 00:05:59.500
 friends i hope i could give you one 

00:05:58.240 --> 00:06:01.240
 Help a little and enjoy the 

00:05:59.500 --> 00:06:03.870
 last seconds of the gameplay until then 

00:06:01.240 --> 00:06:03.870
 pure skin 

00:06:04.210 --> 00:06:06.690
 March 

00:06:47.620 --> 00:06:52.449
 at the end 

00:06:50.090 --> 00:06:54.719
 allied threaten 

00:06:52.449 --> 00:06:54.719
