00:00:39.790 --> 00:00:39.800 

00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:41.930 

studies<00:00:40.800> have<00:00:40.829> showed<00:00:41.190> in<00:00:41.370> all<00:00:41.520> the<00:00:41.670> research

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:41.940 
studies have showed in all the research

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:43.490 
studies have showed in all the research
that<00:00:42.120> I've<00:00:42.270> done<00:00:42.300> said<00:00:42.780> about<00:00:42.960> a<00:00:43.020> thousand

00:00:43.490 --> 00:00:43.500 
that I've done said about a thousand

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:46.569 
that I've done said about a thousand
calories<00:00:44.010> per<00:00:44.399> class<00:00:45.149> give<00:00:45.600> or<00:00:45.629> take<00:00:45.780> you<00:00:46.350> know

00:00:46.569 --> 00:00:46.579 
calories per class give or take you know

00:00:46.579 --> 00:00:49.430 
calories per class give or take you know
and<00:00:47.579> then<00:00:48.059> you<00:00:48.239> know<00:00:48.420> also<00:00:48.629> it's<00:00:48.899> a<00:00:48.960> great<00:00:49.200> time

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:49.440 
and then you know also it's a great time

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:50.930 
and then you know also it's a great time
you<00:00:49.649> know<00:00:49.680> for<00:00:49.920> your<00:00:50.010> kids<00:00:50.280> to<00:00:50.399> come<00:00:50.640> in<00:00:50.789> and

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:50.940 
you know for your kids to come in and

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:53.000 
you know for your kids to come in and

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:53.010 
jump in and play too if you want to you

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:54.380 
jump in and play too if you want to you
know<00:00:53.129> bring<00:00:53.340> them<00:00:53.489> a<00:00:53.520> lot<00:00:53.760> of<00:00:53.879> gems<00:00:54.030> require

00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:54.390 
know bring them a lot of gems require

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:55.520 
know bring them a lot of gems require
you<00:00:54.510> to<00:00:54.629> pay<00:00:54.750> an<00:00:54.840> additional<00:00:55.050> charge

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:55.530 
you to pay an additional charge

00:00:55.530 --> 00:01:00.049 
you to pay an additional charge
therefore<00:00:56.520> the<00:00:56.640> kids<00:00:57.510> membership<00:00:58.020> too<00:00:59.030> so<00:01:00.030> I

00:01:00.049 --> 00:01:00.059 
therefore the kids membership too so I

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:02.840 
therefore the kids membership too so I
think<00:01:00.570> its<00:01:00.750> intensity<00:01:01.230> the<00:01:01.469> variety<00:01:02.100> you're

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:02.850 
think its intensity the variety you're

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:11.450 
think its intensity the variety you're
gonna<00:01:02.969> put<00:01:03.180> your<00:01:03.210> your<00:01:03.930> muscles<00:01:04.860> into<00:01:05.010> a<00:01:05.159> shop

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:11.460 

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:14.190 

it's<00:01:12.460> always<00:01:12.640> something<00:01:13.120> different<00:01:13.540> like

00:01:14.190 --> 00:01:14.200 
it's always something different like

00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:15.960 
it's always something different like
next<00:01:14.500> time<00:01:14.620> we<00:01:14.740> come<00:01:14.890> we<00:01:15.070> may<00:01:15.220> not<00:01:15.370> do<00:01:15.580> like<00:01:15.790> the

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:15.970 
next time we come we may not do like the

00:01:15.970 --> 00:01:18.990 
next time we come we may not do like the
obstacle<00:01:16.690> course<00:01:16.720> you<00:01:17.290> know<00:01:17.890> we<00:01:18.610> may<00:01:18.760> focus

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:19.000 
obstacle course you know we may focus

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:20.970 
obstacle course you know we may focus
more<00:01:19.450> on<00:01:19.480> like<00:01:20.020> the<00:01:20.140> tumble<00:01:20.470> trip<00:01:20.650> will<00:01:20.890> do

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:20.980 
more on like the tumble trip will do

00:01:20.980 --> 00:01:24.930 
more on like the tumble trip will do
bear<00:01:21.220> crawls<00:01:21.550> crab<00:01:22.330> walks<00:01:23.430> you<00:01:24.430> know<00:01:24.550> walking

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:24.940 
bear crawls crab walks you know walking

00:01:24.940 --> 00:01:27.240 
bear crawls crab walks you know walking
push-ups<00:01:25.570> it's<00:01:25.870> all<00:01:26.050> different<00:01:26.380> every<00:01:26.980> single

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:27.250 
push-ups it's all different every single

00:01:27.250 --> 00:01:32.700 
push-ups it's all different every single
class<00:01:27.370> is<00:01:27.580> different<00:01:31.500> you're<00:01:32.500> working

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:32.710 
class is different you're working

00:01:32.710 --> 00:01:35.520 
class is different you're working
against<00:01:33.370> the<00:01:33.490> trampoline<00:01:34.060> so<00:01:34.810> you<00:01:35.260> know<00:01:35.350> like

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:35.530 
against the trampoline so you know like

00:01:35.530 --> 00:01:36.960 
against the trampoline so you know like
if<00:01:35.680> you<00:01:35.770> just<00:01:35.890> got<00:01:36.130> on<00:01:36.250> the<00:01:36.340> trampoline<00:01:36.790> and

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:36.970 
if you just got on the trampoline and

00:01:36.970 --> 00:01:38.940 
if you just got on the trampoline and
jumping<00:01:37.000> and<00:01:37.570> we're<00:01:37.720> bounding<00:01:38.230> up<00:01:38.440> that's

00:01:38.940 --> 00:01:38.950 
jumping and we're bounding up that's

00:01:38.950 --> 00:01:40.980 
jumping and we're bounding up that's
easy<00:01:39.220> breezy<00:01:39.610> but<00:01:39.910> it's<00:01:40.060> when<00:01:40.270> you<00:01:40.360> stop<00:01:40.720> and

you hold and you work against the

00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:44.040 
you hold and you work against the
trampoline<00:01:43.000> that<00:01:43.330> adds<00:01:43.479> the<00:01:43.690> different

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:44.050 
trampoline that adds the different

00:01:44.050 --> 00:01:47.969 
trampoline that adds the different
dynamic<00:01:44.619> to<00:01:44.650> it<00:01:45.300> you're<00:01:46.300> going<00:01:46.450> to<00:01:46.510> get<00:01:46.979> more

00:01:47.969 --> 00:01:47.979 
dynamic to it you're going to get more

00:01:47.979 --> 00:01:50.790 
dynamic to it you're going to get more
results<00:01:48.210> you<00:01:49.210> know<00:01:49.330> faster<00:01:50.080> with<00:01:50.350> a<00:01:50.380> shorter

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:50.800 
results you know faster with a shorter

00:01:50.800 --> 00:01:52.320 
results you know faster with a shorter
amount<00:01:50.830> of<00:01:51.190> time<00:01:51.250> you<00:01:51.610> don't<00:01:51.759> have<00:01:51.910> to<00:01:52.090> spend
