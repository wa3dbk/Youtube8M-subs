animated<00:00:42.360> now<00:00:43.050> this<00:00:43.469> is<00:00:43.649> kind<00:00:44.070> of<00:00:44.309> a<00:00:44.430> tweak

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:44.700 
animated now this is kind of a tweak

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:46.340 
animated now this is kind of a tweak
with<00:00:44.879> a<00:00:44.910> facade<00:00:45.390> because<00:00:45.930> it<00:00:46.050> doesn't

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:46.350 
with a facade because it doesn't

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:48.170 
with a facade because it doesn't
actually<00:00:46.530> animate<00:00:47.129> your<00:00:47.280> icons<00:00:47.789> what's

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:48.180 
actually animate your icons what's

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:50.209 
actually animate your icons what's
really<00:00:48.539> happening<00:00:49.020> here<00:00:49.320> is<00:00:49.559> there's<00:00:49.860> a<00:00:49.920> video

00:00:50.209 --> 00:00:50.219 
really happening here is there's a video

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:52.670 
really happening here is there's a video
wallpaper<00:00:50.640> on<00:00:51.180> the<00:00:51.210> background<00:00:51.930> and<00:00:52.170> all<00:00:52.469> of

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:52.680 
wallpaper on the background and all of

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:55.100 
wallpaper on the background and all of
your<00:00:52.829> icons<00:00:53.309> are<00:00:53.579> clear<00:00:54.030> so<00:00:54.510> you<00:00:54.570> basically

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:55.110 
your icons are clear so you basically

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:57.979 
your icons are clear so you basically
just<00:00:55.379> place<00:00:55.829> your<00:00:56.070> icons<00:00:56.610> on<00:00:56.940> the<00:00:57.449> video

00:00:57.979 --> 00:00:57.989 
just place your icons on the video

00:00:57.989 --> 00:00:59.779 
just place your icons on the video
wallpaper<00:00:58.289> on<00:00:58.710> the<00:00:58.859> back<00:00:59.010> to<00:00:59.280> make<00:00:59.430> it<00:00:59.579> look

00:00:59.779 --> 00:00:59.789 
wallpaper on the back to make it look

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:02.000 
wallpaper on the back to make it look
like<00:01:00.090> they're<00:01:00.329> animated<00:01:00.930> icons<00:01:01.079> but<00:01:01.890> it's

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:02.010 
like they're animated icons but it's

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:03.860 
like they're animated icons but it's
still<00:01:02.250> pretty<00:01:02.520> awesome<00:01:03.059> the<00:01:03.420> only<00:01:03.660> downside

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:03.870 
still pretty awesome the only downside

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:05.750 
still pretty awesome the only downside
to<00:01:04.379> it<00:01:04.409> is<00:01:04.650> that<00:01:04.860> you<00:01:04.949> don't<00:01:05.159> really<00:01:05.400> get<00:01:05.700> to

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:05.760 
to it is that you don't really get to

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:07.609 
to it is that you don't really get to
rearrange<00:01:06.180> your<00:01:06.570> apps<00:01:06.780> the<00:01:07.110> way<00:01:07.229> you<00:01:07.290> want

00:01:07.609 --> 00:01:07.619 
rearrange your apps the way you want

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:09.890 
rearrange your apps the way you want
them<00:01:07.710> unless<00:01:08.430> they're<00:01:08.820> other<00:01:09.210> apps<00:01:09.510> that

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:09.900 
them unless they're other apps that

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:12.260 
them unless they're other apps that
aren't<00:01:10.229> stock<00:01:10.770> apps<00:01:11.070> that<00:01:11.790> you<00:01:11.939> have<00:01:12.119> in

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:12.270 
aren't stock apps that you have in

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:14.570 
aren't stock apps that you have in
folders<00:01:12.720> or<00:01:13.020> on<00:01:13.290> other<00:01:13.320> pages<00:01:13.860> or<00:01:14.220> something

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:14.580 
folders or on other pages or something

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:16.730 
folders or on other pages or something
but<00:01:15.119> the<00:01:15.330> tweak<00:01:15.570> still<00:01:15.930> looks<00:01:16.170> great<00:01:16.350> if<00:01:16.619> you

00:01:16.730 --> 00:01:16.740 
but the tweak still looks great if you

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:19.010 
but the tweak still looks great if you
don't<00:01:16.920> mind<00:01:17.070> having<00:01:17.580> them<00:01:18.150> all<00:01:18.360> in<00:01:18.600> a<00:01:18.720> set

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:19.020 
don't mind having them all in a set

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:20.899 
don't mind having them all in a set
place<00:01:19.320> and<00:01:19.680> never<00:01:19.920> changing<00:01:20.520> until<00:01:20.670> you

00:01:20.899 --> 00:01:20.909 
place and never changing until you

00:01:20.909 --> 00:01:22.280 
place and never changing until you
change<00:01:21.180> the<00:01:21.390> tweak<00:01:21.630> or<00:01:21.780> something<00:01:22.140> like<00:01:22.229> that

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:22.290 
change the tweak or something like that

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:24.649 
change the tweak or something like that
still<00:01:23.159> is<00:01:23.310> awesome<00:01:23.790> I<00:01:23.970> really<00:01:24.360> like<00:01:24.479> the

00:01:24.649 --> 00:01:24.659 
still is awesome I really like the

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:26.899 
still is awesome I really like the
YouTube<00:01:25.049> one<00:01:25.320> where<00:01:25.560> it<00:01:25.680> just<00:01:25.890> has<00:01:26.070> the<00:01:26.520> snow

00:01:26.899 --> 00:01:26.909 
YouTube one where it just has the snow

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:29.030 
YouTube one where it just has the snow
going<00:01:27.390> in<00:01:27.509> the<00:01:27.630> back<00:01:27.780> of<00:01:27.990> the<00:01:28.140> TV<00:01:28.320> screen<00:01:28.560> and

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:29.040 
going in the back of the TV screen and

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:32.480 
going in the back of the TV screen and
the<00:01:29.970> tweak<00:01:30.689> is<00:01:30.960> pretty<00:01:31.320> easy<00:01:31.619> to<00:01:31.920> set<00:01:32.159> up<00:01:32.189> as

00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:32.490 
the tweak is pretty easy to set up as

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:34.730

like<00:02:11.039> my<00:02:11.340> ipod<00:02:11.849> app<00:02:12.150> being<00:02:12.569> right<00:02:12.900> there

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:13.260 
like my ipod app being right there

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:15.619 
like my ipod app being right there
I<00:02:13.319> liked<00:02:13.830> it<00:02:14.010> being<00:02:14.220> down<00:02:14.430> there<00:02:14.670> but<00:02:15.030> once

00:02:15.619 --> 00:02:15.629 
I liked it being down there but once

00:02:15.629 --> 00:02:17.690 
I liked it being down there but once
again<00:02:15.810> that's<00:02:16.409> the<00:02:16.709> background<00:02:16.950> and<00:02:17.459> that's

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:17.700 
again that's the background and that's

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:19.610 
again that's the background and that's
what<00:02:17.970> you<00:02:18.090> have<00:02:18.239> to<00:02:18.269> stick<00:02:18.689> with<00:02:18.720> so<00:02:19.470> it's

00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:19.620 
what you have to stick with so it's

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:21.679 
what you have to stick with so it's
still<00:02:19.829> a<00:02:19.890> great<00:02:20.250> video<00:02:20.549> wallpaper<00:02:20.970> in<00:02:21.569> the

00:02:21.679 --> 00:02:21.689 
still a great video wallpaper in the

00:02:21.689 --> 00:02:23.990 
still a great video wallpaper in the
back<00:02:21.900> and<00:02:22.170> also<00:02:22.620> theme<00:02:22.980> since<00:02:23.370> it<00:02:23.549> does<00:02:23.730> theme

00:02:23.990 --> 00:02:24.000

your<00:02:24.180> icons<00:02:24.569> to<00:02:24.720> be<00:02:24.930> clear<00:02:25.200> and<00:02:25.379> I<00:02:25.890> think<00:02:26.250> it's

00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:26.400 
your icons to be clear and I think it's

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:27.949 
your icons to be clear and I think it's
definitely<00:02:26.610> worth<00:02:27.060> the<00:02:27.329> one<00:02:27.510> dollar<00:02:27.720> and

00:02:27.949 --> 00:02:27.959 
definitely worth the one dollar and

00:02:27.959 --> 00:02:30.740 
definitely worth the one dollar and
fifty<00:02:28.290> cents<00:02:28.680> I<00:02:28.829> haven't<00:02:29.370> seen<00:02:29.610> any<00:02:29.909> real<00:02:30.390> loss
