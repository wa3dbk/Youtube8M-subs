for the eighth of november this year so
I<00:00:27.990> thought<00:00:28.320> it'd<00:00:28.470> be<00:00:28.500> pretty<00:00:28.800> cool<00:00:28.920> to<00:00:29.160> make

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:29.490 
I thought it'd be pretty cool to make

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:33.049 
I thought it'd be pretty cool to make

and<00:00:33.360> that's<00:00:34.110> not<00:00:34.230> too<00:00:34.410> bad<00:00:34.440> to<00:00:34.860> do<00:00:35.040> so<00:00:35.489> what

00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:35.880 
and that's not too bad to do so what

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:37.280 
and that's not too bad to do so what
you're<00:00:36.000> going<00:00:36.120> to<00:00:36.210> need<00:00:36.329> to<00:00:36.390> do<00:00:36.660> this<00:00:36.840> is<00:00:37.050> I<00:00:37.079> use

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:37.290 
you're going to need to do this is I use

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:39.139 
you're going to need to do this is I use
a<00:00:37.440> rounded<00:00:37.950> square<00:00:38.160> at<00:00:38.460> the<00:00:38.489> background<00:00:38.730> but

00:00:39.139 --> 00:00:39.149 
a rounded square at the background but

00:00:39.149 --> 00:00:40.280 
a rounded square at the background but
obviously<00:00:39.360> the<00:00:39.480> background<00:00:39.840> doesn't<00:00:40.020> matter

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:40.290 
obviously the background doesn't matter

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:42.260 
obviously the background doesn't matter
whatevers<00:00:40.770> black<00:00:41.070> I<00:00:41.340> just<00:00:41.550> fully<00:00:41.820> so<00:00:42.030> like

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:42.270 
whatevers black I just fully so like

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:44.600 
whatevers black I just fully so like
cover<00:00:42.510> the<00:00:42.780> background<00:00:43.200> in<00:00:43.350> black<00:00:43.620> you<00:00:44.309> need<00:00:44.579> a

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:44.610 
cover the background in black you need a

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:47.529 
cover the background in black you need a
lieutenant<00:00:45.360> times<00:00:45.629> seven<00:00:46.079> that's<00:00:46.289> on<00:00:46.440> page<00:00:46.620> 24

00:00:47.529 --> 00:00:47.539 
lieutenant times seven that's on page 24

00:00:47.539 --> 00:00:50.990 
lieutenant times seven that's on page 24
rectangle<00:00:48.539> medium<00:00:48.989> times<00:00:49.260> 3<00:00:49.559> on<00:00:49.680> page<00:00:49.710> 19<00:00:50.640> and

00:00:50.990 --> 00:00:51.000 
rectangle medium times 3 on page 19 and

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:54.770 
rectangle medium times 3 on page 19 and
a<00:00:51.360> digital<00:00:51.930> three<00:00:52.320> times<00:00:52.860> one<00:00:53.280> on<00:00:53.550> page<00:00:54.210> one

00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:54.780 
a digital three times one on page one

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:57.110 
a digital three times one on page one
now<00:00:55.410> it's<00:00:55.620> pretty<00:00:55.770> straightforward<00:00:56.160> nothing

00:00:57.110 --> 00:00:57.120 
now it's pretty straightforward nothing

00:00:57.120 --> 00:00:59.779 
now it's pretty straightforward nothing
too<00:00:57.420> dramatic<00:00:58.219> that's<00:00:59.219> just<00:00:59.309> the<00:00:59.430> case<00:00:59.640> of

00:00:59.779 --> 00:00:59.789 
too dramatic that's just the case of

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:01.790 
too dramatic that's just the case of
getting<00:01:00.030> these<00:01:00.239> sizes<00:01:00.600> right<00:01:01.020> and<00:01:01.320> getting

00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:01.800 
getting these sizes right and getting

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:03.789 
getting these sizes right and getting
the<00:01:01.980> scaling<00:01:02.430> right<00:01:02.579> because<00:01:02.879> if<00:01:02.969> you<00:01:03.059> get<00:01:03.210> the

00:01:03.789 --> 00:01:03.799 
the scaling right because if you get the

00:01:03.799 --> 00:01:06.920 
the scaling right because if you get the
MW<00:01:04.799> wrong<00:01:05.070> all<00:01:05.549> goes<00:01:06.000> to<00:01:06.210> pot<00:01:06.450> and<00:01:06.630> doesn't

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:06.930 
MW wrong all goes to pot and doesn't

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:09.380 
MW wrong all goes to pot and doesn't
look<00:01:07.049> very<00:01:07.080> good<00:01:07.350> so<00:01:07.979> took<00:01:08.850> a<00:01:08.909> little<00:01:09.150> bit<00:01:09.330> of

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:09.390 
look very good so took a little bit of

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:11.420 
look very good so took a little bit of
fiddling<00:01:09.659> about<00:01:09.990> and<00:01:10.439> getting<00:01:10.710> the<00:01:10.860> actual

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:11.430 
fiddling about and getting the actual

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:14.240 
fiddling about and getting the actual
scales<00:01:11.850> right<00:01:12.240> but<00:01:12.900> generally<00:01:13.140> it<00:01:13.650> wasn't<00:01:14.100> too

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:14.250 
scales right but generally it wasn't too

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:16.510 
scales right but generally it wasn't too
bad<00:01:14.280> it<00:01:14.909> I<00:01:15.180> had<00:01:15.390> it<00:01:15.420> done<00:01:15.570> pretty<00:01:15.960> quickly<00:01:16.259> so

00:01:16.510 --> 00:01:16.520 
bad it I had it done pretty quickly so

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:19.130 
bad it I had it done pretty quickly so

by ear and see what happens so the
images<00:01:50.939> coming<00:01:51.149> together<00:01:51.329> there<00:01:51.630> goes<00:01:51.840> you

00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:52.020 
images coming together there goes you

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:53.660 
images coming together there goes you
can<00:01:52.170> see<00:01:52.320> I've<00:01:52.439> basically<00:01:52.979> use<00:01:53.159> the<00:01:53.189> outline

00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:53.670 
can see I've basically use the outline

can see I've basically use the outline
of<00:01:53.700> the<00:01:54.030> rectangle<00:01:54.750> medium<00:01:55.140> just<00:01:55.380> to<00:01:55.500> put<00:01:55.649> the

00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:55.770 
of the rectangle medium just to put the

00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:58.550 
of the rectangle medium just to put the
lines<00:01:56.009> and<00:01:56.490> make<00:01:56.939> it<00:01:57.149> look<00:01:57.299> very<00:01:57.360> authentic<00:01:58.350> I
