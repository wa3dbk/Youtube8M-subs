00:02:02.660 --> 00:02:02.670 
to behave with instantaneous rpm shift

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:04.370 
to behave with instantaneous rpm shift
regardless<00:02:03.300> of<00:02:03.450> how<00:02:03.540> hard<00:02:03.720> you<00:02:03.870> press<00:02:04.020> down<00:02:04.320> on

the<00:02:04.560> gas<00:02:04.740> pedal<00:02:04.980> in<00:02:05.550> order<00:02:05.790> to<00:02:05.910> simulate<00:02:06.120> this

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:06.450 
the gas pedal in order to simulate this

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:08.570 
the gas pedal in order to simulate this
we<00:02:06.660> use<00:02:06.810> the<00:02:06.960> function<00:02:07.320> rpm<00:02:07.740> smooth<00:02:08.070> which

00:02:08.570 --> 00:02:08.580 
we use the function rpm smooth which

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:10.490 
we use the function rpm smooth which
works<00:02:08.850> like<00:02:08.940> a<00:02:09.090> rubber<00:02:09.330> band<00:02:09.600> around<00:02:09.840> the<00:02:10.080> rpm

00:02:10.490 --> 00:02:10.500 
works like a rubber band around the rpm

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:13.040 
works like a rubber band around the rpm
values<00:02:10.920> think<00:02:11.880> of<00:02:11.970> it<00:02:12.060> as<00:02:12.150> submerging<00:02:12.750> the<00:02:12.870> gas

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:13.050 
values think of it as submerging the gas

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:15.170 
values think of it as submerging the gas
pedal<00:02:13.500> into<00:02:13.620> viscous<00:02:14.070> liquid<00:02:14.490> and<00:02:14.670> even

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:15.180 
pedal into viscous liquid and even

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:16.430 
pedal into viscous liquid and even
though<00:02:15.300> the<00:02:15.450> game<00:02:15.690> may<00:02:15.870> press<00:02:16.170> down<00:02:16.410> really

00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:16.440 
though the game may press down really

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:18.710 
though the game may press down really
hard<00:02:16.740> the<00:02:17.280> rpm<00:02:17.730> values<00:02:18.120> that<00:02:18.270> come<00:02:18.450> out<00:02:18.600> the

00:02:18.710 --> 00:02:18.720 
hard the rpm values that come out the

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:20.630 
hard the rpm values that come out the
other<00:02:18.840> end<00:02:19.110> will<00:02:19.260> take<00:02:19.290> a<00:02:19.470> bit<00:02:19.710> of<00:02:19.740> time<00:02:19.980> before

00:02:20.630 --> 00:02:20.640 
other end will take a bit of time before

their target values reached okay here

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:25.820 
their target values reached okay here
we're<00:02:24.510> going<00:02:24.660> to<00:02:24.750> introduce<00:02:24.930> some<00:02:25.170> smoothing

00:02:25.820 --> 00:02:25.830 
we're going to introduce some smoothing

00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:34.180 
we're going to introduce some smoothing
I'm<00:02:27.110> going<00:02:28.110> to<00:02:28.200> exaggerate<00:02:28.830> the<00:02:29.010> rpm<00:02:29.490> input

00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:34.190 

00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:37.130 

a<00:02:35.190> little<00:02:35.640> more<00:02:35.849> smoothing<00:02:36.360> some<00:02:36.840> really

00:02:37.130 --> 00:02:37.140 
a little more smoothing some really

00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:43.300 
a little more smoothing some really
harsh<00:02:37.500> input<00:02:38.129> rpm<00:02:38.670> changes

00:02:43.300 --> 00:02:43.310 

00:02:43.310 --> 00:02:57.710 

but<00:02:44.270> the<00:02:44.420> output<00:02:44.900> rpm<00:02:45.349> is<00:02:45.560> smooth

00:02:57.710 --> 00:02:57.720 

00:02:57.720 --> 00:02:59.729 

okay<00:02:58.720> we'll<00:02:58.900> move<00:02:59.049> on<00:02:59.200> to<00:02:59.290> the<00:02:59.409> second

00:02:59.729 --> 00:02:59.739

affecting<00:03:11.290> the<00:03:11.409> sound<00:03:11.680> in<00:03:11.860> this<00:03:12.010> engine<00:03:12.250> patch

00:03:12.630 --> 00:03:12.640 
affecting the sound in this engine patch

00:03:12.640 --> 00:03:15.360 
affecting the sound in this engine patch
I<00:03:12.970> will<00:03:13.629> move<00:03:13.840> the<00:03:14.049> load<00:03:14.260> value<00:03:14.769> up<00:03:14.980> and<00:03:15.190> down

00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:15.370 
I will move the load value up and down

00:03:15.370 --> 00:03:17.640 
I will move the load value up and down
while<00:03:15.700> keeping<00:03:15.879> the<00:03:16.150> RPM<00:03:16.599> fixed<00:03:17.079> have<00:03:17.620> a

00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:17.650 
while keeping the RPM fixed have a

00:03:17.650 --> 00:03:32.479 
while keeping the RPM fixed have a
listen

00:03:32.479 --> 00:03:32.489 

00:03:32.489 --> 00:03:34.559 

let's<00:03:33.489> check<00:03:33.670> out<00:03:33.879> the<00:03:33.999> remaining<00:03:34.390> load

00:03:34.559 --> 00:03:34.569 
let's check out the remaining load

00:03:34.569 --> 00:03:37.170 
let's check out the remaining load
parameters<00:03:35.140> load<00:03:35.859> smooth<00:03:36.280> does<00:03:36.849> the<00:03:36.969> same

00:03:37.170 --> 00:03:37.180 
parameters load smooth does the same

00:03:37.180 --> 00:03:39.270 
parameters load smooth does the same
thing<00:03:37.389> for<00:03:37.540> a<00:03:37.599> load<00:03:37.780> as<00:03:38.019> RPM<00:03:38.469> smooth<00:03:38.829> did<00:03:39.069> for

00:03:39.270 --> 00:03:39.280 
thing for a load as RPM smooth did for

00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:41.729 
thing for a load as RPM smooth did for
rpm<00:03:39.700> so<00:03:39.999> we'll<00:03:40.120> set<00:03:40.299> it<00:03:40.420> to<00:03:40.510> a<00:03:40.540> value<00:03:40.749> of<00:03:40.959> 0.15

00:03:41.729 --> 00:03:41.739 
rpm so we'll set it to a value of 0.15

00:03:41.739 --> 00:03:43.800 
rpm so we'll set it to a value of 0.15
as<00:03:42.129> a<00:03:42.159> starting<00:03:42.519> point<00:03:42.670> let's<00:03:42.969> see<00:03:43.659> what

00:03:43.800 --> 00:03:43.810 
as a starting point let's see what

00:03:43.810 --> 00:03:45.539 
as a starting point let's see what
happens<00:03:44.139> when<00:03:44.230> we<00:03:44.379> set<00:03:44.560> load<00:03:44.799> scaled<00:03:45.129> to<00:03:45.310> 10

00:03:45.539 --> 00:03:45.549 
happens when we set load scaled to 10

00:03:45.549 --> 00:03:53.119 
happens when we set load scaled to 10
and<00:03:45.790> move<00:03:46.269> the<00:03:46.420> RPM<00:03:46.810> slider<00:03:47.139> around

00:03:53.119 --> 00:03:53.129 

00:03:53.129 --> 00:03:55.800 

so<00:03:54.129> at<00:03:54.280> value<00:03:54.670> 10<00:03:55.030> were<00:03:55.269> effectively

00:03:55.800 --> 00:03:55.810 
so at value 10 were effectively

00:03:55.810 --> 00:04:00.180 
so at value 10 were effectively
disabling<00:03:56.590> load<00:03:56.920> functionality<00:03:59.069> so<00:04:00.069> we'll

00:04:00.180 --> 00:04:00.190 
disabling load functionality so we'll

00:04:00.190 --> 00:04:02.009 
disabling load functionality so we'll
start<00:04:00.400> adding<00:04:00.519> in<00:04:00.819> a<00:04:00.910> bit<00:04:01.060> of<00:04:01.090> load<00:04:01.420> let's<00:04:01.780> try

00:04:02.009 --> 00:04:02.019 
start adding in a bit of load let's try

00:04:02.019 --> 00:04:15.530 
start adding in a bit of load let's try
a<00:04:02.050> value<00:04:02.290> of<00:04:02.560> 8<00:04:02.769> on<00:04:02.950> the<00:04:03.069> load<00:04:03.220> scale

00:04:15.530 --> 00:04:15.540 

00:04:15.540 --> 00:04:22.610 

let's<00:04:16.049> drive<00:04:16.229> around<00:04:16.410> for

00:04:22.610 --> 00:04:22.620 

00:04:22.620 --> 00:04:24.620 

let's<00:04:23.220> increase<00:04:23.370> the<00:04:23.699> load<00:04:23.880> scale<00:04:24.180> to<00:04:24.389> around

00:04:24.620 --> 00:04:24.630 
let's increase the load scale to around

00:04:24.630 --> 00:04:29.950 
let's increase the load scale to around
1

00:04:29.950 --> 00:04:29.960 

00:04:29.960 --> 00:04:32.719 

so<00:04:30.960> the<00:04:31.110> load<00:04:31.289> scale<00:04:31.590> effectively<00:04:32.250> controls

00:04:32.719 --> 00:04:32.729 
so the load scale effectively controls

00:04:32.729 --> 00:04:35.360 
so the load scale effectively controls
the<00:04:32.909> amount<00:04:33.000> of<00:04:33.419> on<00:04:33.690> load<00:04:34.139> off<00:04:34.409> load<00:04:34.830> sound

00:04:35.360 --> 00:04:35.370 
the amount of on load off load sound

00:04:35.370 --> 00:04:37.909 
the amount of on load off load sound
your<00:04:35.610> engine<00:04:35.940> will<00:04:36.090> have<00:04:36.169> when<00:04:37.169> set<00:04:37.500> to<00:04:37.650> 10

00:04:37.909 --> 00:04:37.919 
your engine will have when set to 10

00:04:37.919 --> 00:04:39.260 
your engine will have when set to 10
there<00:04:38.250> is<00:04:38.340> no<00:04:38.520> change<00:04:38.879> in<00:04:39.030> the<00:04:39.120> engine

00:04:39.260 --> 00:04:39.270 
there is no change in the engine

00:04:39.270 --> 00:04:42.800 
there is no change in the engine
behavior<00:04:39.930> with<00:04:40.740> a<00:04:40.770> load<00:04:41.039> scale<00:04:41.400> of<00:04:41.610> iran<00:04:41.879> 1.0

00:04:42.800 --> 00:04:42.810 
behavior with a load scale of iran 1.0

00:04:42.810 --> 00:04:45.369 
behavior with a load scale of iran 1.0
you<00:04:43.319> hear<00:04:43.530> a<00:04:43.560> much<00:04:43.889> more<00:04:44.069> natural<00:04:44.280> engine

00:04:45.369 --> 00:04:45.379 
you hear a much more natural engine

00:04:45.379 --> 00:04:47.600 
you hear a much more natural engine
remember<00:04:46.379> that<00:04:46.530> typically<00:04:46.860> the<00:04:47.039> engine<00:04:47.400> load

00:04:47.600 --> 00:04:47.610 
remember that typically the engine load

00:04:47.610 --> 00:04:50.330 
remember that typically the engine load
is<00:04:47.849> coming<00:04:48.330> in<00:04:48.479> from<00:04:48.900> your<00:04:49.020> game<00:04:49.259> physics<00:04:49.530> but

00:04:50.330 --> 00:04:50.340 
is coming in from your game physics but

00:04:50.340 --> 00:04:52.850 
is coming in from your game physics but
regardless<00:04:50.940> of<00:04:51.120> what<00:04:51.300> RPM<00:04:51.810> and<00:04:52.080> load<00:04:52.319> values

00:04:52.850 --> 00:04:52.860 
regardless of what RPM and load values

00:04:52.860 --> 00:04:55.249 
regardless of what RPM and load values
that<00:04:53.220> you<00:04:53.370> get<00:04:53.580> in<00:04:53.729> f<00:04:53.909> mod<00:04:54.180> some<00:04:54.750> smoothing

00:04:55.249 --> 00:04:55.259 
that you get in f mod some smoothing

00:04:55.259 --> 00:04:57.830 
that you get in f mod some smoothing
