00:00:00.639 --> 00:00:03.639
 the 

00:00:04.400 --> 00:00:08.230
 for the money grab him and buy new Opel astra with the sale for sale on the 

00:00:08.230 --> 00:00:10.659
 Second-hand market also very nice stuff 

00:00:10.659 --> 00:00:14.949
 take a look at what we have here today m mercedes c class sedan m 

00:00:14.949 --> 00:00:19.969
 audi a4 both from 2009 breed around twenty 21,000 euros 

00:00:20.669 --> 00:00:23.669
 so see which one is neither the tastiest after about four years 

00:00:24.970 --> 00:00:27.769
 to start with the outside first you look at the first one 

00:00:27.769 --> 00:00:29.399
 name with a second hand 

00:00:29.399 --> 00:00:30.460
 old woman 

00:00:30.460 --> 00:00:34.130
 ex lease cars from both states actually belong very nicely 

00:00:34.130 --> 00:00:35.770
 very tight in the paint 

00:00:35.770 --> 00:00:37.540
 a little bit more 

00:00:37.540 --> 00:00:40.720
 oxidation to serve oddly enough they have all 4 

00:00:40.720 --> 00:00:43.720
 but he is really neat it belongs too 

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:48.730
 great as the luggage room 

00:00:48.730 --> 00:00:50.430
 a little 

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:53.430
 paint damage here on the bumper 

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:57.480
 but you can count on it with the author 

00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:01.380
 yes and also who has a decent one the first owner ad he will be one one 

00:01:01.380 --> 00:01:04.530
 seen a break up close 

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:07.620
 but otherwise seriously whole by car 

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:11.340
 behind it is also just usable 

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:14.240
 and a little more points 

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:15.420
 this new 

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:18.479
 dropping a wrong choice how can points 

00:01:22.220 --> 00:01:25.650
 Well, of course you shouldn't be too difficult about that as you do 

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:28.870
 These sales that you must consider that they point 

00:01:28.870 --> 00:01:33.000
 because if you look at that a lot, for this money just a very big audi 

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:36.700
 a4 with fabulously beautiful animals 

00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:39.800
 beautiful leather upholstery 

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:42.840
 and there is also a very nice system answer 

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:46.900
 what stands out despite the fact that this may be the provider of the benefits is that it is festive 

00:01:46.900 --> 00:01:50.180
 interior still finds a very good idea 

00:01:50.180 --> 00:01:53.250
 the whole and a passenger in with the model navigation 

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:56.920
 be michael jansen 

00:01:56.920 --> 00:01:59.920
 and of course cruise control the CD changer club 

00:02:00.550 --> 00:02:02.340
 actually fully equipped 

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:05.340
 because for this price is not at all wrong 

00:02:23.679 --> 00:02:27.539
 then you crawl aboard this mission is for sure if there is then you see this model 

00:02:27.539 --> 00:02:30.569
 also a few years longer than the a4 

00:02:30.569 --> 00:02:33.339
 it still costs quite well 

00:02:33.339 --> 00:02:37.539
 but just look at the fortis tiny screen 

00:02:37.539 --> 00:02:39.339
 current standards oath 

00:02:39.339 --> 00:02:42.339
 it also only works on the basis of pelt 6 

00:02:42.339 --> 00:02:45.009
 yes then you are in that all that just a bit more luxurious 

00:02:45.009 --> 00:02:47.880
 but not to say that the rest is also good in debt 

00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:48.790
 automation 

00:02:48.790 --> 00:02:50.709
 climate control on board 

00:02:50.709 --> 00:02:53.779
 10 leather upholstery say semi-leather upholstery 

00:02:53.779 --> 00:02:58.069
 And also talking about the seats I am sitting in this seat when it is less tasty then 

00:02:58.069 --> 00:03:00.239
 in the a4 

00:03:00.239 --> 00:03:03.000
 the seats are electrically adjustable in height 

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:06.000
 the seat is quite short and fairly flat too 

00:03:06.669 --> 00:03:09.719
 I don't know I would have opted for something more luxurious sea class 

00:03:31.529 --> 00:03:35.279
 and how rich of fables audi a4 from pak m bite and four years old 

00:03:36.339 --> 00:03:39.769
 it has just over a ton on the clock 

00:03:39.769 --> 00:03:42.989
 and that feeling of it is still very solid even drunk driving these 

00:03:42.989 --> 00:03:46.199
 one suspect got a 160 hp version 

00:03:46.199 --> 00:03:49.149
 and if someone has to give up too 

00:03:49.149 --> 00:03:52.189
 point is he is linked to one 

00:03:52.189 --> 00:03:55.189
 our oldies name of course for a continuously variable transmission 

00:03:56.259 --> 00:03:58.779
 That's why I decided to die 

00:03:58.779 --> 00:04:01.779
 mainly because we have a bit of a dual nature 

00:04:01.779 --> 00:04:05.699
 in itself is not known quiet and if you are not behind the counter 

00:04:05.699 --> 00:04:09.829
 with a little effort to get going as if the first were a couple themselves 

00:04:09.829 --> 00:04:12.279
 need to build up before he gets going 

00:04:12.279 --> 00:04:15.149
 however 

00:04:15.149 --> 00:04:16.199
 Hans Schmidt 

00:04:16.199 --> 00:04:19.199
 it will never do 

00:04:20.049 --> 00:04:23.550
 after that I would choose myself for a somewhat more luxurious sea class 

00:04:24.110 --> 00:04:27.110
 but when you are on the road in this car 

00:04:27.610 --> 00:04:30.360
 people who stood up very quickly 

00:04:30.360 --> 00:04:33.530
 still this is not a very comfortable choice 

00:04:34.529 --> 00:04:37.529
 and if you compare that with the aldi then you notice doing that 

00:04:38.629 --> 00:04:43.020
 rear-wheel drive and also not placed sharp and critical look 

00:04:43.020 --> 00:04:44.889
 send in a supply 

00:04:44.889 --> 00:04:46.580
 so a little more searching 

00:04:46.580 --> 00:04:49.409
 you might not expect it on board the seats it is quite one 

00:04:49.409 --> 00:04:50.360
 sharp car 

00:04:50.360 --> 00:04:53.360
 combined with a place 

00:04:53.949 --> 00:04:55.699
 nice degree of comfort 

00:04:55.699 --> 00:04:58.699
 absolutely not 

00:05:01.059 --> 00:05:04.849
 two particularly large business middle class members for the price 

00:05:05.460 --> 00:05:07.569
 mentally a compact middle class 

00:05:07.569 --> 00:05:09.749
 that pleads after the break floppers 

00:05:09.749 --> 00:05:13.209
 but if you asked me which of these two I would take, it would be a hit 

00:05:14.319 --> 00:05:15.760
 when the food prices 

00:05:15.760 --> 00:05:18.349
 both about the same quality 

00:05:18.349 --> 00:05:20.339
 provided with lots of people 

00:05:20.339 --> 00:05:21.939
 particularly comfortable 

00:05:21.939 --> 00:05:25.039
 continue the journey if you ask me personally 

00:05:25.039 --> 00:05:28.989
 I look no more a special feeling inside beautiful stick this dim 

00:05:29.779 --> 00:05:33.180
 but they do not exclude you from any of these 2 ex ministers 

00:05:33.180 --> 00:05:34.210
 emergency yourself
