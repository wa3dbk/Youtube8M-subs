now<00:03:42.950> let's<00:03:43.159> take<00:03:43.340> a<00:03:43.370> look<00:03:43.579> here<00:03:44.060> look<00:03:44.299> at<00:03:44.390> this

00:03:44.500 --> 00:03:44.510 
now let's take a look here look at this

00:03:44.510 --> 00:03:46.720 
now let's take a look here look at this
cluster<00:03:45.200> of<00:03:45.439> thunderstorms<00:03:45.650> here<00:03:46.159> it's<00:03:46.310> not

00:03:46.720 --> 00:03:46.730 
cluster of thunderstorms here it's not

00:03:46.730 --> 00:03:48.160 
cluster of thunderstorms here it's not
just<00:03:47.000> a<00:03:47.090> line<00:03:47.329> but<00:03:47.540> it's<00:03:47.629> gotten<00:03:47.840> itself<00:03:48.079> into

00:03:48.160 --> 00:03:48.170 
just a line but it's gotten itself into

00:03:48.170 --> 00:03:50.289 
just a line but it's gotten itself into
a<00:03:48.379> c-shape<00:03:49.040> and<00:03:49.340> it<00:03:49.640> has<00:03:49.760> a<00:03:49.790> little<00:03:50.090> tail

00:03:50.289 --> 00:03:50.299 
a c-shape and it has a little tail

00:03:50.299 --> 00:03:51.990 
a c-shape and it has a little tail
coming<00:03:50.690> in<00:03:50.840> so<00:03:51.349> there's<00:03:51.560> two<00:03:51.769> of<00:03:51.799> these

00:03:51.990 --> 00:03:52.000 
coming in so there's two of these

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:54.430 
coming in so there's two of these
c-shape<00:03:53.030> there<00:03:53.359> was<00:03:53.450> a<00:03:53.480> little<00:03:53.690> comma-shaped

00:03:54.430 --> 00:03:54.440 
c-shape there was a little comma-shaped

00:03:54.440 --> 00:03:56.289 
c-shape there was a little comma-shaped
swirls<00:03:55.010> coming<00:03:55.340> east<00:03:55.519> to<00:03:55.670> here<00:03:55.849> they<00:03:56.120> take

00:03:56.289 --> 00:03:56.299 
swirls coming east to here they take

00:03:56.299 --> 00:03:58.690 
swirls coming east to here they take
that<00:03:56.510> comma<00:03:56.780> shape<00:03:57.109> because<00:03:57.859> of<00:03:58.069> the<00:03:58.190> surging

00:03:58.690 --> 00:03:58.700 
that comma shape because of the surging

00:03:58.700 --> 00:04:00.339 
that comma shape because of the surging
forward<00:03:59.030> the<00:03:59.329> west<00:03:59.540> to<00:03:59.659> east<00:03:59.690> winds<00:04:00.109> that<00:04:00.290> are

00:04:00.339 --> 00:04:00.349 
forward the west to east winds that are

00:04:00.349 --> 00:04:02.379 
forward the west to east winds that are
surging<00:04:00.769> forward<00:04:01.010> so<00:04:01.280> look<00:04:01.790> what's<00:04:02.030> in<00:04:02.180> line

00:04:02.379 --> 00:04:02.389 
surging forward so look what's in line

00:04:02.389 --> 00:04:03.819 
surging forward so look what's in line

00:04:22.120 --> 00:04:22.130 
counties under warning let's take a look

00:04:22.130 --> 00:04:23.830 
counties under warning let's take a look
at<00:04:22.220> the<00:04:22.280> velocities<00:04:22.789> with<00:04:22.970> this<00:04:23.210> I've<00:04:23.660> been

00:04:23.830 --> 00:04:23.840 
at the velocities with this I've been

00:04:23.840 --> 00:04:25.659 
at the velocities with this I've been
talking<00:04:24.169> about<00:04:24.199> the<00:04:24.470> surging<00:04:24.889> eastward<00:04:25.250> the

00:04:25.659 --> 00:04:25.669 
talking about the surging eastward the

00:04:25.669 --> 00:04:28.300 
talking about the surging eastward the
radar<00:04:26.030> is<00:04:26.270> off<00:04:26.660> to<00:04:26.930> the<00:04:26.960> east<00:04:27.050> here<00:04:27.440> at<00:04:27.530> DTX<00:04:28.070> and

00:04:28.300 --> 00:04:28.310 
radar is off to the east here at DTX and

00:04:28.310 --> 00:04:30.339 
radar is off to the east here at DTX and
so<00:04:28.400> all<00:04:28.610> these<00:04:28.820> greens<00:04:29.210> are<00:04:29.539> strong<00:04:30.050> winds

00:04:30.339 --> 00:04:30.349 
so all these greens are strong winds

00:04:30.349 --> 00:04:32.020 
so all these greens are strong winds
that<00:04:30.680> are<00:04:30.800> pushing<00:04:30.979> their<00:04:31.220> way<00:04:31.250> toward<00:04:31.760> the

00:04:32.020 --> 00:04:32.030 
that are pushing their way toward the

00:04:32.030 --> 00:04:34.120 
that are pushing their way toward the
greater<00:04:32.510> Detroit<00:04:32.720> and<00:04:33.110> Ann<00:04:33.440> Arbor<00:04:33.770> metro

greater Detroit and Ann Arbor metro

00:04:34.130 --> 00:04:35.770 
greater Detroit and Ann Arbor metro
areas<00:04:34.490> let's<00:04:34.789> switch<00:04:35.120> this<00:04:35.330> up<00:04:35.479> into<00:04:35.630> the

00:04:35.770 --> 00:04:35.780 
areas let's switch this up into the

00:04:35.780 --> 00:04:37.450 
areas let's switch this up into the
vertical<00:04:36.050> we<00:04:36.530> could<00:04:36.680> see<00:04:36.830> that<00:04:36.979> because<00:04:37.310> of

00:04:37.450 --> 00:04:37.460 
vertical we could see that because of

00:04:37.460 --> 00:04:39.490 
vertical we could see that because of
those<00:04:37.550> strong<00:04:37.849> surging<00:04:38.449> winds<00:04:38.659> the<00:04:39.289> whole

00:04:39.490 --> 00:04:39.500 
those strong surging winds the whole

00:04:39.500 --> 00:04:41.740 
those strong surging winds the whole
storm<00:04:39.919> leans<00:04:40.250> forward<00:04:40.460> with<00:04:41.360> those<00:04:41.479> very

00:04:41.740 --> 00:04:41.750 
storm leans forward with those very

00:04:41.750 --> 00:04:44.140 
storm leans forward with those very
strong<00:04:42.139> winds<00:04:42.800> down<00:04:43.130> at<00:04:43.430> low<00:04:43.639> levels<00:04:44.000> they're

00:04:44.140 --> 00:04:44.150 
strong winds down at low levels they're

00:04:44.150 --> 00:04:46.629 
strong winds down at low levels they're
just<00:04:44.360> a<00:04:44.449> few<00:04:44.599> thousand<00:04:45.320> foot<00:04:45.470> deep<00:04:45.830> or<00:04:46.010> so<00:04:46.130> it

00:04:46.629 --> 00:04:46.639 
just a few thousand foot deep or so it

00:04:46.639 --> 00:04:48.820 
just a few thousand foot deep or so it
pushes<00:04:47.030> the<00:04:47.150> whole<00:04:47.270> storm<00:04:47.630> forward<00:04:48.139> and<00:04:48.289> so<00:04:48.440> it

00:04:48.820 --> 00:04:48.830 
pushes the whole storm forward and so it

00:04:48.830 --> 00:04:51.310 
pushes the whole storm forward and so it
noses<00:04:49.400> itself<00:04:49.760> forward<00:04:50.120> they<00:04:50.630> storm<00:04:50.900> builds

00:04:51.310 --> 00:04:51.320 
noses itself forward they storm builds

00:04:51.320 --> 00:04:53.200 
noses itself forward they storm builds
