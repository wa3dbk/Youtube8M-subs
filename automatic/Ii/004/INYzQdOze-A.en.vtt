you'd like now for this I'm also going

00:01:05.019 --> 00:01:07.350 
you'd like now for this I'm also going
to<00:01:05.080> be<00:01:05.229> using<00:01:05.470> a<00:01:05.799> paper<00:01:06.190> crimper<00:01:06.850> this<00:01:07.149> is<00:01:07.330> a

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:07.360 
to be using a paper crimper this is a

00:01:07.360 --> 00:01:09.179 
to be using a paper crimper this is a
large<00:01:07.750> one<00:01:08.020> you<00:01:08.200> can<00:01:08.350> get<00:01:08.530> these<00:01:08.680> in<00:01:08.860> smaller

00:01:09.179 --> 00:01:09.189 
large one you can get these in smaller

00:01:09.189 --> 00:01:11.190 
large one you can get these in smaller
sizes<00:01:09.550> and<00:01:10.000> they're<00:01:10.090> not<00:01:10.270> that<00:01:10.509> expensive<00:01:10.899> but

00:01:11.190 --> 00:01:11.200 
sizes and they're not that expensive but

00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:14.130 
sizes and they're not that expensive but
it<00:01:11.470> is<00:01:11.500> nice<00:01:12.190> to<00:01:12.429> have<00:01:12.580> on<00:01:12.729> hand<00:01:13.060> I'm<00:01:13.960> also

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:14.140 
it is nice to have on hand I'm also

00:01:14.140 --> 00:01:16.859 
it is nice to have on hand I'm also
going<00:01:14.500> to<00:01:14.560> be<00:01:14.710> using<00:01:15.220> a<00:01:15.429> pair<00:01:15.880> of<00:01:15.909> fine<00:01:16.360> tip

00:01:16.859 --> 00:01:16.869 
going to be using a pair of fine tip

00:01:16.869 --> 00:01:21.300 
going to be using a pair of fine tip
tweezers<00:01:17.500> this<00:01:18.130> is<00:01:18.310> really<00:01:18.789> helpful<00:01:19.409> and<00:01:20.409> of

00:01:21.300 --> 00:01:21.310 
tweezers this is really helpful and of

00:01:21.310 --> 00:01:24.899 
tweezers this is really helpful and of
course<00:01:21.789> a<00:01:22.140> slotted<00:01:23.140> quilling<00:01:23.649> tool<00:01:23.759> you<00:01:24.759> can

00:01:24.899 --> 00:01:24.909 
course a slotted quilling tool you can

00:01:24.909 --> 00:01:27.300 
course a slotted quilling tool you can
also<00:01:25.060> use<00:01:25.509> a<00:01:25.539> needle<00:01:26.080> tool<00:01:26.289> if<00:01:26.500> you'd<00:01:26.649> like<00:01:26.830> but

00:01:27.300 --> 00:01:27.310 
also use a needle tool if you'd like but

00:01:27.310 --> 00:01:29.940 
also use a needle tool if you'd like but
I<00:01:27.340> find<00:01:27.729> that<00:01:27.880> the<00:01:28.149> slotted<00:01:28.720> tools<00:01:28.959> really<00:01:29.560> are

00:01:29.940 --> 00:01:29.950 
I find that the slotted tools really are

00:01:29.950 --> 00:01:31.949 
I find that the slotted tools really are
much<00:01:30.399> easier<00:01:30.459> to<00:01:30.880> use<00:01:31.149> especially<00:01:31.179> for<00:01:31.929> a

00:01:31.949 --> 00:01:31.959 
much easier to use especially for a

00:01:31.959 --> 00:01:33.930 
much easier to use especially for a
beginner<00:01:32.259> and<00:01:32.619> then<00:01:33.100> you'll<00:01:33.280> need<00:01:33.429> some<00:01:33.490> kind

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:33.940 
beginner and then you'll need some kind

00:01:33.940 --> 00:01:37.080 
beginner and then you'll need some kind
of<00:01:34.149> glue<00:01:34.390> you<00:01:35.229> always<00:01:35.830> want<00:01:36.069> to<00:01:36.130> be<00:01:36.220> sure<00:01:36.580> that

00:01:37.080 --> 00:01:37.090 
of glue you always want to be sure that

00:01:37.090 --> 00:01:40.050 
of glue you always want to be sure that
you're<00:01:37.299> using<00:01:37.539> a<00:01:37.869> clear<00:01:38.229> glue<00:01:38.560> and<00:01:39.310> that<00:01:39.340> it's

00:01:40.050 --> 00:01:40.060 
you're using a clear glue and that it's

00:01:40.060 --> 00:01:42.469 
you're using a clear glue and that it's
not<00:01:40.270> going<00:01:40.509> to<00:01:40.630> be<00:01:40.720> tacky<00:01:41.110> so<00:01:42.039> I'm<00:01:42.099> just<00:01:42.280> gonna

00:01:42.469 --> 00:01:42.479 
not going to be tacky so I'm just gonna

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:46.830 
not going to be tacky so I'm just gonna
pull<00:01:43.479> these<00:01:43.660> apart<00:01:43.920> the<00:01:44.920> paper<00:01:45.580> comes<00:01:46.060> glue

00:01:46.830 --> 00:01:46.840 
pull these apart the paper comes glue

00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:49.770 
pull these apart the paper comes glue
together<00:01:47.229> at<00:01:47.440> the<00:01:47.590> ends<00:01:48.369> in<00:01:49.000> a<00:01:49.209> pack<00:01:49.450> so<00:01:49.479> I'm

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:49.780 
together at the ends in a pack so I'm

00:01:49.780 --> 00:01:52.440 
together at the ends in a pack so I'm
going<00:01:49.899> to<00:01:49.989> pull<00:01:50.170> those<00:01:50.319> apart<00:01:50.530> on<00:01:51.340> either<00:01:52.149> end

00:01:52.440 --> 00:01:52.450 
going to pull those apart on either end

00:01:52.450 --> 00:01:54.660 
going to pull those apart on either end
and<00:01:53.019> then<00:01:53.259> I'm<00:01:53.410> going<00:01:53.530> to<00:01:53.619> clean<00:01:53.979> off<00:01:54.190> this<00:01:54.429> end

00:01:54.660 --> 00:01:54.670 
and then I'm going to clean off this end

00:01:54.670 --> 00:01:56.430 
and then I'm going to clean off this end
and<00:01:54.940> just<00:01:55.119> make<00:01:55.300> sure<00:01:55.509> that<00:01:55.629> I<00:01:55.690> don't<00:01:56.019> have<00:01:56.229> any

00:02:10.139 --> 00:02:10.149 
petals for our flower I'm using an

00:02:10.149 --> 00:02:13.320 
petals for our flower I'm using an
entire<00:02:10.629> strip<00:02:11.140> here<00:02:11.500> but<00:02:12.459> I<00:02:12.700> don't<00:02:12.819> want<00:02:13.060> it

00:02:13.320 --> 00:02:13.330 
entire strip here but I don't want it

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:16.559 
entire strip here but I don't want it
that<00:02:13.540> long<00:02:13.810> so<00:02:14.230> all<00:02:14.440> I<00:02:14.470> need<00:02:14.620> to<00:02:14.830> do<00:02:15.480> so<00:02:16.480> I'm

00:02:16.559 --> 00:02:16.569 
that long so all I need to do so I'm

00:02:16.569 --> 00:02:29.400 
that long so all I need to do so I'm
going<00:02:16.690> to<00:02:16.780> fold<00:02:17.019> this<00:02:17.230> over<00:02:20.610> into<00:02:21.610> thirds

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:29.410 

00:02:29.410 --> 00:02:33.000 

so<00:02:29.950> just<00:02:30.160> folded<00:02:30.580> it<00:02:30.730> over<00:02:31.350> into<00:02:32.350> thirds<00:02:32.650> and

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:33.010 
so just folded it over into thirds and

00:02:33.010 --> 00:02:40.380 
so just folded it over into thirds and
then<00:02:33.940> fold<00:02:34.810> it<00:02:34.960> down<00:02:38.400> come<00:02:39.400> up<00:02:39.550> here<00:02:39.910> and<00:02:40.150> just

00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:40.390 
then fold it down come up here and just

00:02:40.390 --> 00:02:43.770 
then fold it down come up here and just
crease<00:02:40.750> it<00:02:40.960> down<00:02:40.990> and<00:02:41.530> then<00:02:42.010> I<00:02:42.100> know<00:02:42.160> where<00:02:42.880> to

00:02:43.770 --> 00:02:43.780 
crease it down and then I know where to

00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:47.580 
crease it down and then I know where to
just<00:02:43.990> gently<00:02:44.730> break<00:02:45.730> it<00:02:45.910> apart<00:02:46.380> so<00:02:47.380> there's

00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:47.590 
just gently break it apart so there's

00:02:47.590 --> 00:02:52.470 
just gently break it apart so there's
one<00:02:48.100> strip<00:02:50.130> tear<00:02:51.130> it<00:02:51.340> we<00:02:51.520> never<00:02:51.730> want<00:02:52.000> to<00:02:52.090> cut

00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:52.480 
one strip tear it we never want to cut

00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:54.240 
one strip tear it we never want to cut
it<00:02:52.600> with<00:02:52.750> the<00:02:52.900> scissors<00:02:52.930> it's<00:02:53.620> much<00:02:53.830> better<00:02:54.100> to

00:02:54.240 --> 00:02:54.250 
it with the scissors it's much better to

00:02:54.250 --> 00:02:57.390 
it with the scissors it's much better to
tear<00:02:54.760> it<00:02:54.970> your<00:02:55.510> glue<00:02:55.810> will<00:02:56.800> adhere<00:02:56.950> much

00:02:57.390 --> 00:02:57.400 
tear it your glue will adhere much

00:02:57.400 --> 00:02:59.760 
tear it your glue will adhere much
easier<00:02:58.110> there<00:02:59.110> you<00:02:59.260> go

00:02:59.760 --> 00:02:59.770 
easier there you go

00:02:59.770 --> 00:03:03.150 
easier there you go
so<00:03:00.250> I<00:03:00.280> have<00:03:00.640> all<00:03:01.000> of<00:03:01.300> these<00:03:01.480> strips<00:03:02.020> in<00:03:02.470> pink<00:03:02.950> in

00:03:03.150 --> 00:03:03.160

so I have all of these strips in pink in
the<00:03:03.310> same<00:03:03.520> size<00:03:04.210> now<00:03:05.080> I'm<00:03:05.170> going<00:03:05.290> to<00:03:05.380> do<00:03:05.470> the

00:03:05.580 --> 00:03:05.590 
the same size now I'm going to do the

00:03:05.590 --> 00:03:08.520 
the same size now I'm going to do the
exact<00:03:05.980> same<00:03:06.010> thing<00:03:06.720> with<00:03:07.720> our<00:03:07.750> light<00:03:08.140> pink
