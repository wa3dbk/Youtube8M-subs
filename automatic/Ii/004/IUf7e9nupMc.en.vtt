all exact exact movements as an attack

00:01:15.659 --> 00:02:00.680

and<00:01:16.320> blogging<00:01:16.560> on<00:01:16.799> the<00:01:16.890> way<00:01:16.979> or<00:01:17.009> at<00:01:17.280> match

00:02:00.680 --> 00:02:00.690 

00:02:00.690 --> 00:02:03.660 

we<00:02:01.690> didn't<00:02:01.900> mention<00:02:02.200> earlier<00:02:02.320> is<00:02:02.950> that<00:02:03.070> Jeremy

00:02:03.660 --> 00:02:03.670 
we didn't mention earlier is that Jeremy

00:02:03.670 --> 00:02:05.160 
we didn't mention earlier is that Jeremy
is<00:02:03.700> actually<00:02:04.000> using<00:02:04.270> to<00:02:04.479> motion<00:02:04.780> controllers

00:02:05.160 --> 00:02:05.170 
is actually using to motion controllers

00:02:05.170 --> 00:02:06.870 
is actually using to motion controllers
at<00:02:05.320> once<00:02:05.500> and<00:02:05.650> I<00:02:05.710> think<00:02:05.979> that<00:02:06.130> really<00:02:06.160> adds<00:02:06.670> a

00:02:06.870 --> 00:02:06.880 
at once and I think that really adds a

00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:08.609 
at once and I think that really adds a
new<00:02:07.060> element<00:02:07.509> to<00:02:07.630> at<00:02:07.900> the<00:02:08.050> way<00:02:08.170> we're<00:02:08.350> heading

00:02:08.609 --> 00:02:08.619 
new element to at the way we're heading

00:02:08.619 --> 00:02:11.190 
new element to at the way we're heading
our<00:02:08.770> motion<00:02:09.040> control<00:02:09.280> system<00:02:09.310> as<00:02:09.790> well<00:02:10.200> the

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:11.200 
our motion control system as well the

00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:12.660 
our motion control system as well the
next<00:02:11.470> title<00:02:11.620> Jeremy<00:02:12.160> is<00:02:12.250> going<00:02:12.370> to<00:02:12.430> show<00:02:12.610> you

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:12.670 
next title Jeremy is going to show you

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:14.790 
next title Jeremy is going to show you
is<00:02:12.910> from<00:02:13.120> the<00:02:13.240> same<00:02:13.450> game<00:02:13.780> sports<00:02:14.200> champions

00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:14.800 
is from the same game sports champions

00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:17.670 
is from the same game sports champions
and<00:02:15.040> it's<00:02:15.130> the<00:02:15.250> table<00:02:15.640> tennis<00:02:16.110> plate<00:02:17.110> during

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:17.680 
and it's the table tennis plate during

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:19.770 
and it's the table tennis plate during
that<00:02:17.920> game<00:02:18.130> so<00:02:18.459> what<00:02:19.060> he's<00:02:19.209> going<00:02:19.390> to<00:02:19.420> do<00:02:19.570> is

00:02:19.770 --> 00:02:19.780 
that game so what he's going to do is

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:22.260 
that game so what he's going to do is
show<00:02:20.020> you<00:02:20.080> the<00:02:20.380> precision<00:02:21.070> that<00:02:21.250> comes<00:02:21.580> from<00:02:21.940> a

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:22.270 
show you the precision that comes from a

00:02:22.270 --> 00:02:24.510 
show you the precision that comes from a
table<00:02:22.570> tennis<00:02:22.930> game<00:02:23.230> I'm<00:02:23.739> actually<00:02:24.010> a<00:02:24.250> huge

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:24.520 
table tennis game I'm actually a huge

00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:27.360 
table tennis game I'm actually a huge
fan<00:02:24.700> of<00:02:24.730> table<00:02:25.120> tennis<00:02:25.150> myself<00:02:25.780> and<00:02:26.340> when<00:02:27.340> I

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:27.370 
fan of table tennis myself and when I

00:02:27.370 --> 00:02:29.070 
fan of table tennis myself and when I
played<00:02:27.640> previous<00:02:28.120> games<00:02:28.390> I<00:02:28.600> think<00:02:28.840> there<00:02:28.959> was

00:02:29.070 --> 00:02:29.080 
played previous games I think there was

00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:30.900 
played previous games I think there was
just<00:02:29.290> a<00:02:29.380> lot<00:02:29.410> of<00:02:29.680> shaking<00:02:30.160> my<00:02:30.250> hand<00:02:30.520> around<00:02:30.670> to

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:30.910 
just a lot of shaking my hand around to

00:02:30.910 --> 00:02:33.000 
just a lot of shaking my hand around to
get<00:02:31.120> the<00:02:31.239> reaction<00:02:31.360> on<00:02:31.720> the<00:02:31.780> screen<00:02:32.170> but<00:02:32.920> in

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:33.010 
get the reaction on the screen but in

00:02:33.010 --> 00:02:34.860 
get the reaction on the screen but in
this<00:02:33.130> game<00:02:33.400> it<00:02:33.850> really<00:02:34.030> matters<00:02:34.420> when<00:02:34.450> you<00:02:34.660> put

00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:34.870 
this game it really matters when you put

00:02:34.870 --> 00:02:36.930 
this game it really matters when you put
topspin<00:02:35.380> on<00:02:35.440> the<00:02:35.530> ball<00:02:35.620> you<00:02:36.340> can<00:02:36.550> get<00:02:36.760> you<00:02:36.910> know

00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:36.940 
topspin on the ball you can get you know

00:02:36.940 --> 00:02:38.850 
topspin on the ball you can get you know
backwards<00:02:37.630> slide<00:02:37.959> so<00:02:38.200> you<00:02:38.290> can<00:02:38.440> use<00:02:38.560> back

00:02:38.850 --> 00:02:38.860 
backwards slide so you can use back

00:02:38.860 --> 00:02:40.740 
backwards slide so you can use back

hands whatever you want to do and it's
reflected<00:02:41.320> in<00:02:41.410> the<00:02:41.530> game<00:02:41.709> and<00:02:42.070> Jeremy<00:02:42.820> is

to<00:02:54.599> start<00:02:54.810> on<00:02:54.959> the<00:02:55.109> simple<00:02:55.469> syrup<00:02:55.620> you<00:02:55.980> can<00:02:56.099> see

00:02:56.209 --> 00:02:56.219 
to start on the simple syrup you can see

00:02:56.219 --> 00:02:58.490 
to start on the simple syrup you can see
I<00:02:56.250> could<00:02:56.459> rotate<00:02:56.870> controller<00:02:57.870> end<00:02:58.109> and<00:02:58.290> she<00:02:58.439> is

00:02:58.490 --> 00:02:58.500 
I could rotate controller end and she is

00:02:58.500 --> 00:03:00.979 
I could rotate controller end and she is
working<00:02:58.739> for<00:02:58.980> direction<00:02:59.400> what<00:03:00.209> answer<00:03:00.359> by

00:03:00.979 --> 00:03:00.989 
working for direction what answer by

00:03:00.989 --> 00:03:02.360 
working for direction what answer by
