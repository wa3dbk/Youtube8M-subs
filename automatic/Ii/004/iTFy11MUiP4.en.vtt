00:00:12.550 --> 00:00:16.990
 today we are going to talk about biochemistry with 

00:00:15.130 --> 00:00:20.740
 products that we have in the fridge with 

00:00:16.990 --> 00:00:23.200
 acids and with proteins here there are very 

00:00:20.740 --> 00:00:24.460
 television the experiment that we're going to 

00:00:23.200 --> 00:00:27.310
 do next is at least 

00:00:24.460 --> 00:00:31.090
 fascinating let's make plastic to 

00:00:27.310 --> 00:00:33.790
 from milk and vinegar as with medium 

00:00:31.090 --> 00:00:36.130
 liter of milk and 20 milliliters of 

00:00:33.790 --> 00:00:39.660
 white vinegar the fire has to be 

00:00:36.130 --> 00:00:42.420
 Slowly cover 

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:45.330
 and we wait for it to be about to boil 

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:46.760
 we already have the hot milk and what 

00:00:45.330 --> 00:00:49.980
 we have to do next is 

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:51.600
 pour the vinegar what we are going to see is 

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:54.360
 that form lumps are formed 

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:56.340
 yellowish while the rest is clear 

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:58.410
 the liquid has cooled our 

00:00:56.340 --> 00:01:00.269
 mix and we will strain what we 

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:02.640
 remains of the milk we see how it has 

00:01:00.269 --> 00:01:05.640
 rinse the milk because the rest of the 

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:07.619
 protein has curdled it has the same touch 

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:09.810
 that the plastic of the keyboards of 

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:12.410
 laptop computer etc what 

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:12.410
 we can model 

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:16.550
 here we have our plastic what 

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:20.370
 we have made to build this plastic 

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:21.810
 is put vinegar in milk occurs 

00:01:20.370 --> 00:01:23.670
 milk has a series of proteins and a 

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:26.580
 of them is casein that is not soluble 

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:29.700
 in an acid medium such as vinegar and 

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:30.510
 both coagulates precipitates forming those 

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:32.190
 lumps 

00:01:30.510 --> 00:01:34.020
 what do you think if I tell you that you can 

00:01:32.190 --> 00:01:36.300
 prepare some delicious eggs 

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:37.740
 scrambled without lighting the fire and without 

00:01:36.300 --> 00:01:42.320
 use pan first thing you have to 

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:42.320
 to have at hand evidently is the egg 

00:01:46.390 --> 00:01:50.979
 once we have it well beaten 

00:01:48.150 --> 00:01:55.150
 we need alcohol and the only thing 

00:01:50.979 --> 00:01:57.659
 we do is serve it and we let it go 

00:01:55.150 --> 00:01:59.759
 curd the egg 

00:01:57.659 --> 00:02:01.710
 and once we have it set it 

00:01:59.759 --> 00:02:04.440
 The only thing we are going to do is remove the 

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:08.240
 excess of brandy 

00:02:04.440 --> 00:02:08.240
 we can wash it a little with water 

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:14.379
 And the only thing we have to do is 

00:02:10.610 --> 00:02:14.379
 eat it to your health 

00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:18.160
 to understand what has happened what 

00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:20.290
 first thing we have to know is that they are 

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:21.970
 egg proteins a protein in 

00:02:20.290 --> 00:02:23.920
 the background is a very large molecule that 

00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:25.870
 It is made of other molecules 

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:27.490
 small these proteins in the egg and 

00:02:25.870 --> 00:02:29.080
 in ourselves they are in a middle 

00:02:27.490 --> 00:02:31.120
 watery the moment we throw 

00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:32.700
 any alcoholic compound what 

00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:37.500
 they make those proteins is to collapse 

00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:37.500
 they coagulate and form the tortilla 

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:43.110
 these have been our experiments in 

00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:45.360
 biochemistry we have used egg and milk 

00:02:43.110 --> 00:02:48.840
 two sources rich in protein and then 

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:51.290
 vinegar and eau-de-vie of emitted until 

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:51.290
 the next
