dual<00:01:46.670> flow<00:01:47.030> through<00:01:47.300> exhaust<00:01:47.720> so<00:01:47.990> I<00:01:48.020> think

00:01:48.310 --> 00:01:48.320 
dual flow through exhaust so I think

00:01:48.320 --> 00:01:49.690 
dual flow through exhaust so I think
it's<00:01:48.440> got<00:01:48.590> a<00:01:48.619> terrific<00:01:48.920> look<00:01:49.460> on<00:01:49.580> the<00:01:49.670> outside
