00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:05.329
 actually it is like the society that the letter n

 uncertainty pcs May 17 

00:03:57.630 --> 00:03:59.340
 bypassing this central button 

00:03:59.340 --> 00:04:00.899
 respectively, at the holding 

00:04:00.899 --> 00:04:03.119
 gave what will happen to the dictator charging

 now we will go dad 

00:04:07.089 --> 00:04:08.339
 means to comply 

00:04:08.339 --> 00:04:10.459
 brilliant can be like a donut can 

00:04:10.459 --> 00:04:12.419
 such a position on the phone man tons 

00:04:12.419 --> 00:04:12.950
 in year 

00:04:12.950 --> 00:04:14.450
 and in books, respectively 

00:04:14.450 --> 00:04:15.169
 correspondence

00:04:18.109 --> 00:04:20.099
 news background 

00:04:20.099 --> 00:04:22.409
 during the teleconference, I find out that personal 

00:04:22.409 --> 00:04:24.419
 notes clinton this calendar book 

00:04:24.419 --> 00:04:26.459
 the shelf is made in principle no tons 

00:04:26.459 --> 00:04:29.650
 quite clearly but in a paper calendar 

00:04:29.650 --> 00:04:33.300
 cool accustomed 2008 year nuts cars on 

00:04:33.300 --> 00:04:35.029
 construction site 

00:04:35.029 --> 00:04:37.119
 idea, respectively, you can see 

00:04:37.119 --> 00:04:38.970
 device information 

00:04:38.970 --> 00:04:42.510
 it is estimated that around 1,000 are 911 megabytes 

00:04:42.510 --> 00:04:45.090
 memory of which 904 is freedom by the way 

00:04:45.090 --> 00:04:48.220
 well recall that July 4, about 400 tons 

00:04:48.220 --> 00:04:49.490
 fuel 

00:04:49.490 --> 00:04:52.120
 here we are respectively 

00:04:52.120 --> 00:04:54.349
 total couture damage is very important 

00:04:54.349 --> 00:04:57.479
 but dining for a ton but building exterior 

00:04:57.479 --> 00:05:00.879
 and the interior is a resident of Trier so yes 

00:05:00.879 --> 00:05:03.330
 and accordingly with the link here is interesting 

00:05:03.330 --> 00:05:06.059
 thing that can be cleaned here 

00:05:06.059 --> 00:05:08.469
 the movement takes that reform in general 

00:05:08.469 --> 00:05:11.490
 wants to learn better 

00:05:11.490 --> 00:05:14.490
 with porcelain is good but because 

00:05:15.279 --> 00:05:16.670
 no, but to tell yourself 

00:05:16.670 --> 00:05:19.569
 there is that is because bypassing r 

00:05:19.569 --> 00:05:22.599
 This thing is working battery very rapidly 

00:05:22.599 --> 00:05:24.879
 accordingly, there is no course 

00:05:24.879 --> 00:05:28.139
 what kind of laptop that there is no doubt because 

00:05:28.139 --> 00:05:29.189
 electronic ink technology 

00:05:29.189 --> 00:05:31.689
 it's certainly not 

00:05:31.689 --> 00:05:34.180
 tft matrix even less 

00:05:34.180 --> 00:05:37.580
 Raoul is generally enough 

00:05:37.580 --> 00:05:40.930
 I can open the energy-intensive debt to find 

00:05:40.930 --> 00:05:41.969
 acutely 

00:05:41.969 --> 00:05:44.240
 Here I open I quote 

00:05:44.240 --> 00:05:46.979
 it opens with enter 

00:05:46.979 --> 00:05:49.199
 Shot him in the hands of his father shooters 

00:05:49.199 --> 00:05:51.339
 page of them is worthy of course beauty 

00:05:51.339 --> 00:05:53.830
 the capital Komi keys in this side of the price with 

00:05:53.830 --> 00:05:55.499
 pages 

00:05:55.499 --> 00:05:58.000
 I think that a little bit of flaws 

00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:00.670
 common flaw of all electronic ink 

00:06:00.670 --> 00:06:02.610
 e-ink technology books 

00:06:02.610 --> 00:06:05.689
 Who is that flipping through 

00:06:05.689 --> 00:06:09.159
 But with this version of Krakow to regret 

00:06:09.159 --> 00:06:11.819
 it is no one about them 

00:06:11.819 --> 00:06:13.860
 can't handle it 

00:06:13.860 --> 00:06:17.180
 Well, someone prevents me from reflecting a little 

00:06:17.180 --> 00:06:19.530
 Well, otherwise, because it is all the same here with 

00:06:19.530 --> 00:06:21.430
 touch confused expired 

00:06:21.430 --> 00:06:23.789
 I do not know their opinion such a minute all 

00:06:23.789 --> 00:06:25.449
 year is reflected 

00:06:25.449 --> 00:06:26.339
 how so 

00:06:26.339 --> 00:06:29.159
 but without this, it is not necessary to reduce 

00:06:29.159 --> 00:06:31.819
 what is this gilitis warm something 

00:06:31.819 --> 00:06:34.259
 touch that's when us 

00:06:34.259 --> 00:06:36.229
 public people read books under 

00:06:36.229 --> 00:06:38.360
 Canopy they directly on Sumy this year 

00:06:38.360 --> 00:06:40.259
 will not interfere plus more contrast with 

00:06:40.259 --> 00:06:41.720
 good anyway 

00:06:41.720 --> 00:06:44.510
 still very, very clearly seen it was 

00:06:44.510 --> 00:06:46.379
 not in a 

00:06:46.379 --> 00:06:48.699
 here we match too that's him 

00:06:48.699 --> 00:06:51.089
 quality is the answer the country is worth it not at all 

00:06:51.089 --> 00:06:52.129
 It happened 

00:06:52.129 --> 00:06:54.039
 support our planet like 

00:06:54.039 --> 00:06:57.039
 ward according to residential and accordingly 

00:06:57.990 --> 00:07:00.930
 haji puppies no violin pirates 

00:07:00.930 --> 00:07:03.250
 there is copying luck the worst the reader knows 

00:07:03.250 --> 00:07:06.159
 I think successful pieces grow 

00:07:06.159 --> 00:07:07.979
 for holidaying 

00:07:07.979 --> 00:07:09.830
 weather 

00:07:09.830 --> 00:07:12.159
 I highly recommend that is not to carry with you 

00:07:12.159 --> 00:07:14.810
 tons of waste paper along however 

00:07:14.810 --> 00:07:16.399
 because establish that he 

00:07:16.399 --> 00:07:19.609
 I even like maybe I want a cube 

00:07:20.439 --> 00:07:21.879
 that is, but more often 

00:07:21.879 --> 00:07:23.669
 pike perch faces this thing 

00:07:23.669 --> 00:07:26.669
 beautiful moment 

00:07:27.830 --> 00:07:30.099
 grain producers a good product but
