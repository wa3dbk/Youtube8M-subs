iPhone<00:03:14.790> 5s<00:03:15.150> can<00:03:15.329> look<00:03:15.449> the<00:03:15.569> same<00:03:15.689> as<00:03:15.959> the

00:03:16.039 --> 00:03:16.049 
iPhone 5s can look the same as the

iPhone 5s can look the same as the

00:03:17.839 --> 00:03:17.849

release<00:03:18.060> pattern<00:03:18.419> and<00:03:18.599> it's<00:03:18.900> probably<00:03:19.169> rather

00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:19.290 
release pattern and it's probably rather

00:03:19.290 --> 00:03:20.990 
release pattern and it's probably rather
expensive<00:03:19.650> to<00:03:19.889> totally<00:03:20.189> retool<00:03:20.549> machines<00:03:20.909> to

00:03:20.990 --> 00:03:21.000 
expensive to totally retool machines to

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:22.460 
expensive to totally retool machines to
create<00:03:21.180> a<00:03:21.209> new<00:03:21.359> brand<00:03:21.659> industrial<00:03:22.169> design

every<00:03:23.040> stinking<00:03:23.489> year<00:03:23.759> solo<00:03:24.180> a<00:03:24.209> new<00:03:24.359> rumor

00:03:24.619 --> 00:03:24.629 
every stinking year solo a new rumor

Adam<00:03:24.870> kind<00:03:25.079> of<00:03:25.169> suggested<00:03:25.650> Apple<00:03:25.919> will

00:03:26.059 --> 00:03:26.069 
Adam kind of suggested Apple will

00:03:26.069 --> 00:03:27.740 
Adam kind of suggested Apple will
decrease<00:03:26.459> the<00:03:26.639> bezel<00:03:26.939> around<00:03:27.030> the<00:03:27.269> screen<00:03:27.540> so

00:03:27.740 --> 00:03:27.750 
decrease the bezel around the screen so

00:03:27.750 --> 00:03:29.479 
decrease the bezel around the screen so
that<00:03:27.870> it<00:03:27.989> fits<00:03:28.169> closer<00:03:28.530> to<00:03:28.829> the<00:03:28.919> sides<00:03:29.159> of<00:03:29.430> the

a series chip it's gonna power pretty
awesome-looking<00:04:43.310> devices<00:04:44.030> but<00:04:44.479> really<00:04:44.660> want

00:04:44.800 --> 00:04:44.810 
awesome-looking devices but really want

to see that awesome look to just skin
deep<00:04:46.310> or<00:04:46.729> could<00:04:46.880> actually<00:04:47.000> play<00:04:47.330> some<00:04:47.539> games

00:04:47.770 --> 00:04:47.780

deep or could actually play some games
let's<00:04:48.199> go<00:04:48.289> ahead<00:04:48.349> take<00:04:48.530> a<00:04:48.560> look

00:04:48.939 --> 00:04:48.949 
let's go ahead take a look

00:04:48.949 --> 00:04:50.379 
let's go ahead take a look
I<00:04:48.979> knew<00:04:49.340> we<00:04:49.430> could<00:04:49.550> handle<00:04:49.849> everything<00:04:50.060> on<00:04:50.270> the

00:04:50.379 --> 00:04:50.389 
I knew we could handle everything on the

00:04:50.389 --> 00:04:51.820 
I knew we could handle everything on the
lower<00:04:50.570> setting<00:04:51.020> so<00:04:51.229> we<00:04:51.259> thought<00:04:51.470> it'd<00:04:51.590> be<00:04:51.620> more

00:04:51.820 --> 00:04:51.830 
lower setting so we thought it'd be more

00:04:51.830 --> 00:04:53.050 
lower setting so we thought it'd be more
interesting<00:04:52.280> and<00:04:52.310> a<00:04:52.400> better<00:04:52.580> test<00:04:52.880> of<00:04:53.000> the

00:04:53.050 --> 00:04:53.060 
interesting and a better test of the

00:04:53.060 --> 00:04:55.450 
interesting and a better test of the
machines<00:04:53.330> capabilities<00:04:53.870> to<00:04:54.050> bump<00:04:54.349> it<00:04:54.560> up<00:04:54.919> so

00:04:55.450 --> 00:04:55.460 
machines capabilities to bump it up so

00:04:55.460 --> 00:04:57.310 
machines capabilities to bump it up so
we<00:04:55.550> kicked<00:04:55.729> it<00:04:55.820> up<00:04:55.940> to<00:04:56.120> 1080p<00:04:56.630> we<00:04:56.960> kept<00:04:57.199> the

00:04:57.310 --> 00:04:57.320 
we kicked it up to 1080p we kept the

00:04:57.320 --> 00:05:00.430 
we kicked it up to 1080p we kept the
film<00:04:57.620> grain<00:04:57.979> at<00:04:58.370> about<00:04:58.759> 30%<00:04:59.060> affect<00:04:59.900> detail<00:05:00.289> we

00:05:00.430 --> 00:05:00.440 
film grain at about 30% affect detail we

00:05:00.440 --> 00:05:02.499 
film grain at about 30% affect detail we
went<00:05:00.620> to<00:05:00.740> hide<00:05:00.949> the<00:05:01.340> model<00:05:01.849> texture<00:05:02.240> detail

00:05:02.499 --> 00:05:02.509 
went to hide the model texture detail

00:05:02.509 --> 00:05:04.450 
went to hide the model texture detail
also<00:05:02.720> got<00:05:02.960> kicked<00:05:03.199> up<00:05:03.289> to<00:05:03.410> high<00:05:03.560> I<00:05:03.830> wanted<00:05:04.400> to

00:05:04.450 --> 00:05:04.460 
also got kicked up to high I wanted to

00:05:04.460 --> 00:05:05.560
