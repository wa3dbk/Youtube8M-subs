it's neat to Monello I'm going to show
you<00:00:06.540> what<00:00:07.050> I<00:00:07.080> call<00:00:07.290> the<00:00:07.439> dynamic<00:00:07.649> pigeons<00:00:08.400> it's

00:00:08.629 --> 00:00:08.639 
you what I call the dynamic pigeons it's

00:00:08.639 --> 00:00:10.820 
you what I call the dynamic pigeons it's
something<00:00:09.030> that<00:00:09.180> I've<00:00:09.500> developed<00:00:10.500> as<00:00:10.800> a

00:00:10.820 --> 00:00:10.830 
something that I've developed as a

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:13.220 
something that I've developed as a
variation<00:00:11.549> a<00:00:11.669> more<00:00:11.820> of<00:00:11.910> a<00:00:11.969> dynamic<00:00:12.230> variation

00:00:13.220 --> 00:00:13.230 
variation a more of a dynamic variation

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:15.230 
variation a more of a dynamic variation
dynamic<00:00:13.740> warm-up<00:00:14.070> variation<00:00:14.580> of<00:00:14.730> the<00:00:14.879> yoga

00:00:15.230 --> 00:00:15.240 
dynamic warm-up variation of the yoga

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:18.710 
dynamic warm-up variation of the yoga
pigeon<00:00:15.690> pose<00:00:16.190> and<00:00:17.420> basically<00:00:18.420> it's<00:00:18.570> a<00:00:18.600> good

00:00:18.710 --> 00:00:18.720 
pigeon pose and basically it's a good

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:20.450 
pigeon pose and basically it's a good
hip<00:00:18.900> rotate<00:00:19.380> or<00:00:19.500> dynamic<00:00:19.950> stretch<00:00:20.130> and<00:00:20.310> hip

00:00:20.450 --> 00:00:20.460 
hip rotate or dynamic stretch and hip

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:21.980 
hip rotate or dynamic stretch and hip
rotators<00:00:20.850> so<00:00:21.030> I<00:00:21.060> got<00:00:21.240> to<00:00:21.330> face<00:00:21.480> away<00:00:21.630> from<00:00:21.900> you

00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:21.990 
rotators so I got to face away from you

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:22.490 
rotators so I got to face away from you
to<00:00:22.080> show<00:00:22.290> you

00:00:22.490 --> 00:00:22.500 
to show you

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:24.410 
to show you
so<00:00:23.310> traditionally<00:00:23.940> well<00:00:24.060> let<00:00:24.150> me<00:00:24.210> show<00:00:24.360> you

so traditionally well let me show you

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:25.880 
so traditionally well let me show you
this<00:00:24.510> first<00:00:24.660> traditionally<00:00:25.260> how<00:00:25.410> people<00:00:25.710> get

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:25.890 
this first traditionally how people get

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:27.200 
this first traditionally how people get
into<00:00:26.070> pigeon<00:00:26.250> pose<00:00:26.430> if<00:00:26.820> you're<00:00:26.940> not<00:00:27.060> familiar

00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:27.210 
into pigeon pose if you're not familiar

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:29.240 
into pigeon pose if you're not familiar
if<00:00:27.600> you<00:00:27.720> are<00:00:27.810> familiar<00:00:27.990> is<00:00:28.470> they<00:00:28.860> kind<00:00:29.040> of<00:00:29.160> get

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:29.250 
if you are familiar is they kind of get

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:30.920 
if you are familiar is they kind of get
in<00:00:29.370> this<00:00:29.460> push-up<00:00:29.700> position<00:00:29.970> and<00:00:30.390> swing<00:00:30.750> this

00:00:30.920 --> 00:00:30.930 
in this push-up position and swing this

00:00:30.930 --> 00:00:33.560 
in this push-up position and swing this
leg<00:00:30.990> in<00:00:31.380> like<00:00:31.590> this<00:00:31.770> and<00:00:31.920> then<00:00:32.009> drop<00:00:32.700> down<00:00:33.090> so

00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:33.570 
leg in like this and then drop down so

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:35.360 
leg in like this and then drop down so
what<00:00:33.690> that<00:00:33.809> looks<00:00:34.050> like<00:00:34.110> from<00:00:34.350> the<00:00:34.530> back<00:00:34.739> is

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:35.370 
what that looks like from the back is

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:37.310 
what that looks like from the back is
you're<00:00:35.579> here<00:00:35.850> this<00:00:36.179> leg<00:00:36.390> comes<00:00:36.690> across<00:00:36.929> and

00:00:37.310 --> 00:00:37.320 
you're here this leg comes across and

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:38.989 
you're here this leg comes across and
then<00:00:37.410> you<00:00:37.530> kind<00:00:37.949> of<00:00:37.980> look<00:00:38.160> like<00:00:38.190> that<00:00:38.339> to

00:00:38.989 --> 00:00:38.999 
then you kind of look like that to

00:00:38.999 --> 00:00:40.400 
then you kind of look like that to
stretch<00:00:39.210> the<00:00:39.359> hip<00:00:39.480> rotators<00:00:39.870> on<00:00:40.109> the<00:00:40.199> side

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:40.410 
stretch the hip rotators on the side

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:42.590 
stretch the hip rotators on the side
great<00:00:40.739> stretch<00:00:41.100> but<00:00:41.460> when<00:00:42.269> you're<00:00:42.420> very

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:42.600 
great stretch but when you're very

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:44.599 
great stretch but when you're very
limited<00:00:42.870> in<00:00:43.199> mobility<00:00:43.920> there<00:00:44.070> a<00:00:44.129> lot<00:00:44.429> of<00:00:44.519> us

00:00:44.599 --> 00:00:44.609 
limited in mobility there a lot of us

00:00:44.609 --> 00:00:47.720 
limited in mobility there a lot of us
are<00:00:44.789> is<00:00:45.059> it<00:00:45.899> can<00:00:46.350> be<00:00:46.530> even<00:00:46.620> tough<00:00:46.920> to<00:00:47.070> get<00:00:47.309> into

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:47.730 
are is it can be even tough to get into

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:49.399 
are is it can be even tough to get into
it<00:00:47.909> much<00:00:48.089> less<00:00:48.300> to<00:00:48.480> get<00:00:48.629> down<00:00:48.809> and<00:00:49.019> do<00:00:49.140> it<00:00:49.170> right

00:00:49.399 --> 00:00:49.409 
it much less to get down and do it right

00:00:49.409 --> 00:00:51.380 
it much less to get down and do it right
the<00:00:49.589> back<00:00:49.769> starts<00:00:50.159> to<00:00:50.309> round<00:00:50.519> so<00:00:50.670> we<00:00:51.030> start<00:00:51.269> to

00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:51.390 
the back starts to round so we start to

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:53.299 
the back starts to round so we start to
roll<00:00:51.600> all<00:00:52.140> that<00:00:52.440> stuff<00:00:52.710> so<00:00:53.010> here's<00:00:53.190> a

00:00:53.299 --> 00:00:53.309 
roll all that stuff so here's a

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:55.880 
roll all that stuff so here's a
variation<00:00:53.609> I<00:00:54.149> came<00:00:54.719> up<00:00:54.899> with<00:00:54.929> to<00:00:55.409> incorporate

00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:55.890 
variation I came up with to incorporate

00:00:55.890 --> 00:00:58.189 
variation I came up with to incorporate
this<00:00:56.069> into<00:00:56.280> type<00:00:56.550> to<00:00:56.819> a<00:00:56.850> dynamic<00:00:57.089> warm-up<00:00:57.659> and

00:00:58.189 --> 00:00:58.199 
this into type to a dynamic warm-up and

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:00.139 
this into type to a dynamic warm-up and
also<00:00:58.469> make<00:00:58.800> it<00:00:58.829> easier<00:00:59.159> to<00:00:59.309> coach<00:00:59.519> and<00:00:59.760> do<00:00:59.909> well

00:01:00.139 --> 00:01:00.149 
also make it easier to coach and do well

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:02.419 
also make it easier to coach and do well
so<00:01:00.690> facing<00:01:01.409> this<00:01:01.710> way<00:01:01.769> you<00:01:01.979> could<00:01:02.069> be<00:01:02.190> on<00:01:02.280> all

00:01:02.419 --> 00:01:02.429 
so facing this way you could be on all

00:01:02.429 --> 00:01:04.579 
so facing this way you could be on all
fours<00:01:02.569> what<00:01:03.569> I'm<00:01:03.659> going<00:01:03.809> to<00:01:03.870> do<00:01:04.019> is<00:01:04.350> I'm<00:01:04.559> going

00:01:04.579 --> 00:01:04.589 
fours what I'm going to do is I'm going

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:08.149 
fours what I'm going to do is I'm going
to<00:01:04.739> take<00:01:04.949> one<00:01:05.729> leg<00:01:05.940> across<00:01:06.720> and<00:01:07.110> back<00:01:07.259> about<00:01:07.680> 45

00:01:08.149 --> 00:01:08.159 
to take one leg across and back about 45

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:10.370 
to take one leg across and back about 45
degrees<00:01:08.549> and<00:01:08.790> then<00:01:09.390> just<00:01:09.570> say<00:01:09.719> slide<00:01:10.049> it<00:01:10.200> back

00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:10.380 
degrees and then just say slide it back

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:13.670 
degrees and then just say slide it back
about<00:01:10.619> 45<00:01:11.100> degrees<00:01:11.430> like<00:01:12.000> so<00:01:12.229> and<00:01:13.229> you<00:01:13.469> bring

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:13.680 
about 45 degrees like so and you bring

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:18.950 
about 45 degrees like so and you bring
it<00:01:13.829> home<00:01:14.009> and<00:01:14.399> you<00:01:15.299> go<00:01:15.479> to<00:01:15.990> the<00:01:16.560> other<00:01:17.280> side<00:01:17.960> so

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:18.960 
it home and you go to the other side so

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:20.480 
it home and you go to the other side so
you<00:01:19.079> one<00:01:19.229> more<00:01:19.350> rep<00:01:19.560> from<00:01:19.710> this<00:01:19.890> reel<00:01:20.100> and<00:01:20.399> then

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:20.490 
you one more rep from this reel and then

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:21.649 
you one more rep from this reel and then
I'll<00:01:20.579> turn<00:01:20.759> around<00:01:21.000> so<00:01:21.149> you<00:01:21.210> can<00:01:21.390> see<00:01:21.420> what<00:01:21.600> it

00:01:21.649 --> 00:01:21.659 
I'll turn around so you can see what it

00:01:21.659 --> 00:01:25.969 
I'll turn around so you can see what it
looks<00:01:21.810> like<00:01:21.899> familiar<00:01:22.409> view<00:01:24.200> all<00:01:25.200> right<00:01:25.439> so

00:01:25.969 --> 00:01:25.979 
looks like familiar view all right so

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:27.980 
looks like familiar view all right so
what's<00:01:26.850> happening<00:01:27.240> there<00:01:27.420> is<00:01:27.450> it<00:01:27.630> gets<00:01:27.780> me<00:01:27.930> in

00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:27.990 
what's happening there is it gets me in

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:30.289 
what's happening there is it gets me in
the<00:01:28.079> same<00:01:28.259> position<00:01:28.860> but<00:01:29.070> allows<00:01:29.789> me<00:01:29.969> to<00:01:30.090> keep

00:01:30.289 --> 00:01:30.299 
the same position but allows me to keep

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:32.270 
the same position but allows me to keep
my<00:01:30.479> technique<00:01:31.350> a<00:01:31.439> lot<00:01:31.590> better<00:01:31.799> and<00:01:32.009> get<00:01:32.159> the

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:32.280 
my technique a lot better and get the

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:33.800 
my technique a lot better and get the
movement<00:01:32.490> from<00:01:32.729> wild<00:01:33.060> one<00:01:33.240> which<00:01:33.450> is<00:01:33.570> it<00:01:33.689> may

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:33.810 
movement from wild one which is it may

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:35.510 
movement from wild one which is it may
have<00:01:33.899> rotators<00:01:34.409> so<00:01:35.070> here's<00:01:35.310> what<00:01:35.430> it<00:01:35.460> looks

00:01:35.510 --> 00:01:35.520 
have rotators so here's what it looks

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:37.010 
have rotators so here's what it looks
like<00:01:35.700> from<00:01:35.820> the<00:01:35.939> front<00:01:36.000> I<00:01:36.329> instruct<00:01:36.689> keep<00:01:36.899> your

00:01:37.010 --> 00:01:37.020 
like from the front I instruct keep your

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:38.420

as far as your hips allow do you feel a
little<00:02:08.849> mobility<00:02:09.849> there<00:02:10.119> so<00:02:10.239> we<00:02:10.330> don't<00:02:10.420> really

00:02:10.589 --> 00:02:10.599 
little mobility there so we don't really

00:02:10.599 --> 00:02:11.880 
little mobility there so we don't really
use<00:02:10.690> it<00:02:10.899> as<00:02:10.959> a<00:02:11.050> static<00:02:11.410> stretch<00:02:11.560> over<00:02:11.800> there

00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:11.890 
use it as a static stretch over there

00:02:11.890 --> 00:02:13.800 
use it as a static stretch over there
you<00:02:12.040> can<00:02:12.220> it's<00:02:12.760> something<00:02:13.090> that<00:02:13.209> we<00:02:13.450> like<00:02:13.690> to

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:13.810 
you can it's something that we like to

00:02:13.810 --> 00:02:18.150 
you can it's something that we like to
use<00:02:14.020> as<00:02:14.340> part<00:02:15.340> of<00:02:15.430> active<00:02:16.000> dynamic
