we're very excited about introducing

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:39.740 
we're very excited about introducing
programming<00:00:38.370> and<00:00:38.730> electrical<00:00:39.329> engineering

00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:39.750

2px<00:00:40.340> haha<00:00:41.340> thats<00:00:42.239> Hillary<00:00:42.510> have<00:00:42.629> to<00:00:42.719> program

00:00:42.889 --> 00:00:42.899 
2px haha thats Hillary have to program

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:45.709 
2px haha thats Hillary have to program
yourself<00:00:43.340> so<00:00:44.340> actually<00:00:44.579> yes<00:00:44.910> this<00:00:45.180> is<00:00:45.360> a<00:00:45.510> very

yourself so actually yes this is a very

00:00:45.719 --> 00:00:47.479 
yourself so actually yes this is a very
simplistic<00:00:46.289> approach<00:00:46.559> am<00:00:46.860> I<00:00:46.950> saying<00:00:47.219> okay<00:00:47.460> I

00:00:47.479 --> 00:00:47.489 
simplistic approach am I saying okay I

simplistic approach am I saying okay I
can<00:00:47.730> quickly<00:00:47.940> show<00:00:48.059> you<00:00:48.270> how<00:00:48.510> that<00:00:48.690> ok<00:00:49.260> done<00:00:49.440> ok

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:49.860 
can quickly show you how that ok done ok

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:53.209 
can quickly show you how that ok done ok
play<00:00:50.210> so<00:00:51.210> first<00:00:51.480> off<00:00:51.920> go<00:00:52.920> ahead<00:00:53.039> and<00:00:53.129> just

so<00:01:01.789> reports<00:01:02.179> voice<00:01:02.390> and<00:01:02.750> move<00:01:02.929> on<00:01:03.140> and<00:01:03.320> by

00:01:03.520 --> 00:01:03.530 
so reports voice and move on and by

00:01:03.530 --> 00:01:05.530 
so reports voice and move on and by
moving<00:01:03.739> them<00:01:04.040> you're<00:01:04.400> kind<00:01:04.729> of<00:01:04.850> laying<00:01:05.210> in

00:01:05.530 --> 00:01:05.540 
moving them you're kind of laying in

00:01:05.540 --> 00:01:07.539 
moving them you're kind of laying in
recording<00:01:06.020> ends<00:01:06.170> on<00:01:06.560> your<00:01:06.770> programming<00:01:07.430> as

00:01:07.539 --> 00:01:07.549 
recording ends on your programming as

00:01:07.549 --> 00:01:09.700 
recording ends on your programming as
you're<00:01:07.729> moving<00:01:07.850> Wow<00:01:08.330> use<00:01:08.780> your<00:01:08.900> smart<00:01:09.259> servos

00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:09.710 
you're moving Wow use your smart servos

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:11.380 
you're moving Wow use your smart servos
yeah<00:01:10.070> that's<00:01:10.369> a<00:01:10.460> quick<00:01:10.640> way<00:01:10.700> to<00:01:10.820> do<00:01:11.030> it<00:01:11.180> so<00:01:11.360> you

00:01:11.380 --> 00:01:11.390 
yeah that's a quick way to do it so you

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:13.060 
yeah that's a quick way to do it so you
don't<00:01:11.600> have<00:01:11.659> to<00:01:11.780> actually<00:01:11.930> try<00:01:12.530> to<00:01:12.590> edit<00:01:12.770> type

00:01:13.060 --> 00:01:13.070 
don't have to actually try to edit type

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:14.649 
don't have to actually try to edit type
in<00:01:13.220> the<00:01:13.280> ones<00:01:13.490> and<00:01:13.700> zeroes<00:01:14.000> right<00:01:14.030> yeah<00:01:14.450> we're

00:01:14.649 --> 00:01:14.659 
in the ones and zeroes right yeah we're

00:01:14.659 --> 00:01:16.480 
in the ones and zeroes right yeah we're
getting<00:01:14.899> away<00:01:15.020> from<00:01:15.080> you<00:01:15.320> yeah<00:01:15.710> terrific

00:01:16.480 --> 00:01:16.490 
getting away from you yeah terrific

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:27.310 
getting away from you yeah terrific
that's<00:01:17.299> all<00:01:17.450> what<00:01:17.600> is<00:01:25.840> you<00:01:26.840> can<00:01:26.990> actually<00:01:27.020> see

00:01:27.310 --> 00:01:27.320 
that's all what is you can actually see

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:29.410 
that's all what is you can actually see
guys<00:01:27.649> in<00:01:27.860> arming<00:01:27.979> animation<00:01:28.670> you<00:01:28.820> can<00:01:28.850> layer

00:01:29.410 --> 00:01:29.420 
guys in arming animation you can layer

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:31.389 
guys in arming animation you can layer
that<00:01:29.630> on<00:01:29.810> and<00:01:29.990> creep<00:01:30.380> behavior<00:01:30.590> building<00:01:31.220> so

00:01:31.389 --> 00:01:31.399 
that on and creep behavior building so

00:01:31.399 --> 00:01:33.389 
that on and creep behavior building so
you<00:01:31.460> can<00:01:31.700> even<00:01:31.820> make<00:01:32.030> them<00:01:32.180> do<00:01:32.570> a<00:01:32.600> dancer

00:01:33.389 --> 00:01:33.399 
you can even make them do a dancer

00:01:33.399 --> 00:01:35.350 
you can even make them do a dancer
exactly<00:01:34.399> exactly<00:01:34.550> actually<00:01:34.970> have<00:01:35.210> some

00:01:35.350 --> 00:01:35.360 
exactly exactly actually have some

00:01:35.360 --> 00:01:36.820 
exactly exactly actually have some
laughs<00:01:35.539> some<00:01:35.750> pre-recorded<00:01:35.990> dance<00:01:36.560> leaders

00:01:36.820 --> 00:01:36.830 
laughs some pre-recorded dance leaders

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:38.080 
laughs some pre-recorded dance leaders
if<00:01:36.950> you<00:01:37.009> want<00:01:37.159> to<00:01:37.220> go<00:01:37.310> hold<00:01:37.610> this<00:01:37.729> up<00:01:37.940> so<00:01:38.060> I

00:01:38.080 --> 00:01:38.090 
if you want to go hold this up so I

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:39.760 
if you want to go hold this up so I
could<00:01:38.149> see<00:01:38.420> that<00:01:38.569> I<00:01:38.630> can't<00:01:38.929> so<00:01:39.350> he's<00:01:39.560> done

00:01:39.760 --> 00:01:39.770 
could see that I can't so he's done

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:41.800 
could see that I can't so he's done
tablet<00:01:40.250> here<00:01:40.399> that<00:01:40.909> works<00:01:41.119> on<00:01:41.240> a<00:01:41.300> tablet<00:01:41.690> what

00:01:41.800 --> 00:01:41.810 
tablet here that works on a tablet what

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:43.719 
tablet here that works on a tablet what
else<00:01:41.990> does<00:01:42.080> that<00:01:42.200> work<00:01:42.380> on<00:01:42.590> so<00:01:43.039> this<00:01:43.220> works<00:01:43.520> on

00:01:43.719 --> 00:01:43.729 
else does that work on so this works on
