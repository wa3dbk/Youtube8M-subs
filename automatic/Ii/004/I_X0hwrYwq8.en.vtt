00:00:59.540 --> 00:00:59.550 
accessories we're going to see that in a

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:02.510 
accessories we're going to see that in a
little<00:00:59.789> bit<00:00:59.989> the<00:01:00.989> power<00:01:01.260> of<00:01:01.440> H<00:01:01.590> is<00:01:01.949> it's<00:01:02.340> got

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:02.520 
little bit the power of H is it's got

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:04.160 
little bit the power of H is it's got
infinity<00:01:03.030> support<00:01:03.449> and<00:01:03.629> that's<00:01:03.750> the<00:01:03.930> quad

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:04.170 
infinity support and that's the quad

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:06.410 
infinity support and that's the quad
quad<00:01:05.159> HD<00:01:05.369> thing<00:01:05.790> that<00:01:05.970> they're<00:01:06.090> talking<00:01:06.240> about

00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:06.420 
quad HD thing that they're talking about

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:08.210 
quad HD thing that they're talking about
so<00:01:06.689> you<00:01:06.720> can<00:01:06.810> have<00:01:07.020> 4<00:01:07.229> displays<00:01:07.680> at<00:01:07.920> the<00:01:08.010> same

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:08.220 
so you can have 4 displays at the same

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:13.070 
so you can have 4 displays at the same
time<00:01:09.979> and<00:01:10.979> all<00:01:11.640> of<00:01:11.790> this<00:01:11.880> other<00:01:12.090> stuff<00:01:12.600> which

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:13.080 
time and all of this other stuff which

toonies<00:01:17.520> play<00:01:17.850> for<00:01:18.150> so<00:01:18.360> let's<00:01:18.540> just<00:01:18.720> crack

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:18.960 
toonies play for so let's just crack

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:21.440 
toonies play for so let's just crack
this<00:01:19.140> thing<00:01:19.200> open<00:01:19.490> I'll<00:01:20.490> read<00:01:20.700> off<00:01:21.119> a<00:01:21.150> couple

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:21.450 
this thing open I'll read off a couple

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:23.060 
this thing open I'll read off a couple
specs<00:01:21.869> but<00:01:22.049> this<00:01:22.200> is<00:01:22.320> pretty<00:01:22.530> much<00:01:22.680> the<00:01:22.920> same

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:23.070 
specs but this is pretty much the same

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:24.530 
specs but this is pretty much the same
thing<00:01:23.310> as<00:01:23.400> a<00:01:23.430> reference<00:01:23.970> I've<00:01:24.090> actually<00:01:24.240> got<00:01:24.509> a

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:24.540 
thing as a reference I've actually got a

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:26.660 
thing as a reference I've actually got a
little<00:01:24.840> spec<00:01:25.650> sheet<00:01:25.920> that<00:01:26.100> I'm<00:01:26.250> looking<00:01:26.400> off

00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:26.670 
little spec sheet that I'm looking off

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:29.359 
little spec sheet that I'm looking off
of<00:01:26.850> right<00:01:27.000> here<00:01:27.180> so<00:01:27.659> it's<00:01:27.780> got<00:01:27.869> 640<00:01:28.860> stream

00:01:29.359 --> 00:01:29.369 
of right here so it's got 640 stream

00:01:29.369 --> 00:01:32.450 
of right here so it's got 640 stream
processors<00:01:30.680> which<00:01:31.680> actually<00:01:32.100> isn't<00:01:32.220> that

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:32.460 
processors which actually isn't that

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:34.730 
processors which actually isn't that
much<00:01:32.670> but<00:01:32.970> you<00:01:33.270> know<00:01:33.450> this<00:01:33.720> is<00:01:33.869> this<00:01:34.320> part<00:01:34.619> is

00:01:34.730 --> 00:01:34.740 
much but you know this is this part is

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:36.530 
much but you know this is this part is
actually<00:01:34.920> only<00:01:35.250> about<00:01:35.369> I<00:01:35.820> think<00:01:36.090> I<00:01:36.180> looked<00:01:36.420> it

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:36.540 
actually only about I think I looked it

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:38.390 
actually only about I think I looked it
up<00:01:36.630> it<00:01:36.780> was<00:01:36.840> about<00:01:37.110> 130<00:01:37.710> bucks<00:01:37.979> off<00:01:38.189> the<00:01:38.310> new

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:38.400 
up it was about 130 bucks off the new

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:40.730 
up it was about 130 bucks off the new
wave<00:01:38.579> so<00:01:39.119> it's<00:01:39.270> actually<00:01:39.420> not<00:01:39.869> too<00:01:40.200> bad<00:01:40.229> this

00:01:40.730 --> 00:01:40.740 
wave so it's actually not too bad this

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:44.200 
wave so it's actually not too bad this
is<00:01:40.890> probably<00:01:41.250> one<00:01:41.430> of<00:01:41.460> the<00:01:41.570> you<00:01:42.570> know<00:01:42.600> cheaper

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:44.210 
is probably one of the you know cheaper

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:47.569 
is probably one of the you know cheaper

got some nice low self I've got a DVI to
VGA<00:02:04.170> adapter<00:02:04.939> and<00:02:05.939> that's<00:02:06.420> pretty<00:02:06.689> much<00:02:06.780> it<00:02:07.049> so

00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:08.090 
VGA adapter and that's pretty much it so

00:02:08.090 --> 00:02:10.339 
VGA adapter and that's pretty much it so
if<00:02:09.090> there's<00:02:09.300> anything<00:02:09.479> wrong<00:02:09.690> funny<00:02:09.959> okay

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:13.710 
so on the bottom here we've got a driver

00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:19.300 
so on the bottom here we've got a driver
and<00:02:14.510> installation<00:02:15.510> guide<00:02:15.720> which<00:02:17.180> open<00:02:18.180> there

00:02:19.300 --> 00:02:19.310 
and installation guide which open there

00:02:19.310 --> 00:02:22.880 
and installation guide which open there
it's<00:02:20.310> got<00:02:20.490> the<00:02:20.610> CD<00:02:20.880> there<00:02:21.120> Scott<00:02:21.690> I<00:02:22.020> assume<00:02:22.770> an

it's got the CD there Scott I assume an

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:24.500 
it's got the CD there Scott I assume an
installation<00:02:23.520> guide<00:02:23.550> there<00:02:23.970> and<00:02:24.210> then<00:02:24.330> it's

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:24.510 
installation guide there and then it's

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:29.620 
installation guide there and then it's
got<00:02:24.750> a<00:02:24.780> little<00:02:25.620> sticker<00:02:26.120> power<00:02:27.120> power<00:02:28.110> up<00:02:28.410> cool

00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:29.630 
got a little sticker power power up cool

00:02:29.630 --> 00:02:32.470 
got a little sticker power power up cool
cool<00:02:30.630> cool<00:02:30.900> cool

it's got another CD in there and I turbo
your<00:02:38.070> graphics<00:02:38.430> assistant<00:02:38.940> so<00:02:39.570> this<00:02:39.720> probably

00:02:39.980 --> 00:02:39.990 
your graphics assistant so this probably

00:02:39.990 --> 00:02:43.420 
your graphics assistant so this probably
utility<00:02:40.650> for<00:02:40.920> overclocking<00:02:41.990> whatever<00:02:42.990> so

00:02:43.420 --> 00:02:43.430 
utility for overclocking whatever so

00:02:43.430 --> 00:02:46.850 
utility for overclocking whatever so
anyways<00:02:44.720> let's<00:02:45.720> take<00:02:45.959> a<00:02:45.990> look<00:02:46.290> at<00:02:46.530> the

00:02:46.850 --> 00:02:46.860 
anyways let's take a look at the

00:02:46.860 --> 00:02:48.680 
anyways let's take a look at the
graphics<00:02:47.310> card<00:02:47.550> itself<00:02:47.850> like<00:02:48.150> I<00:02:48.270> said<00:02:48.510> it's

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:48.690 
graphics card itself like I said it's

00:02:48.690 --> 00:02:53.000 
graphics card itself like I said it's
got<00:02:48.810> 640<00:02:49.680> strand<00:02:49.950> processors<00:02:50.550> 16<00:02:51.240> ro<00:02:51.480> keys<00:02:52.010> one

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:53.010 
got 640 strand processors 16 ro keys one

00:02:53.010 --> 00:02:57.350 
got 640 strand processors 16 ro keys one
gig<00:02:53.280> of<00:02:53.520> gddr5<00:02:54.150> and<00:02:55.520> it's<00:02:56.520> a<00:02:56.610> 1<00:02:56.790> gigahertz<00:02:56.940> core

actually<00:03:45.180> a<00:03:45.390> very<00:03:45.630> reference<00:03:46.310> board<00:03:47.310> design

00:03:47.690 --> 00:03:47.700 
actually a very reference board design

00:03:47.700 --> 00:03:49.370 
actually a very reference board design
it's<00:03:48.180> kind<00:03:48.450> of<00:03:48.510> not<00:03:48.690> you<00:03:48.959> know<00:03:49.019> it<00:03:49.230> doesn't

00:03:49.370 --> 00:03:49.380 
it's kind of not you know it doesn't

00:03:49.380 --> 00:03:51.590 
it's kind of not you know it doesn't
have<00:03:49.590> that<00:03:49.620> nice<00:03:50.100> black<00:03:50.820> color<00:03:51.180> or<00:03:51.390> anything

it's got the blue but now for the most
part<00:03:55.200> lower<00:03:55.980> end<00:03:56.250> cards<00:03:56.640> don't<00:03:56.820> really<00:03:57.150> have

00:03:57.380 --> 00:03:57.390 
part lower end cards don't really have

00:03:57.390 --> 00:03:59.390 
part lower end cards don't really have
that<00:03:57.420> and<00:03:57.810> you<00:03:57.870> know<00:03:57.989> nice<00:03:58.170> black<00:03:58.440> color<00:03:58.650> we've

00:03:59.390 --> 00:03:59.400 
that and you know nice black color we've

00:03:59.400 --> 00:04:02.750 
that and you know nice black color we've
got<00:03:59.549> these<00:03:59.700> 6<00:04:00.000> pin<00:04:00.360> power<00:04:01.290> adapter<00:04:02.100> there<00:04:02.310> so

00:04:02.750 --> 00:04:02.760 
got these 6 pin power adapter there so

00:04:02.760 --> 00:04:04.100 
got these 6 pin power adapter there so
you<00:04:02.820> got<00:04:03.060> to<00:04:03.150> plug<00:04:03.330> it<00:04:03.450> into<00:04:03.630> your<00:04:03.840> power

00:04:04.100 --> 00:04:04.110 
you got to plug it into your power

00:04:04.110 --> 00:04:06.830 
you got to plug it into your power
supply<00:04:04.580> don't<00:04:05.580> forget<00:04:05.880> that<00:04:06.060> or<00:04:06.269> computer
