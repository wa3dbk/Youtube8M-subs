00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:53.550 
believe that it is a very good program

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:56.270 
believe that it is a very good program
and<00:00:54.059> I<00:00:54.329> want<00:00:54.570> to<00:00:54.690> show<00:00:54.840> you<00:00:54.899> guys<00:00:55.110> how<00:00:55.800> easy<00:00:56.070> it

00:00:56.270 --> 00:00:56.280 
and I want to show you guys how easy it

00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:57.770 
and I want to show you guys how easy it
is<00:00:56.309> to<00:00:56.520> use<00:00:56.670> and<00:00:56.910> the<00:00:57.000> quality<00:00:57.390> that<00:00:57.420> it<00:00:57.629> kicks

00:00:57.770 --> 00:00:57.780 
is to use and the quality that it kicks

00:00:57.780 --> 00:00:59.689 
is to use and the quality that it kicks
out<00:00:57.930> so<00:00:58.199> with<00:00:58.590> that<00:00:58.649> being<00:00:58.800> said<00:00:59.039> let's<00:00:59.430> get<00:00:59.550> to

00:00:59.689 --> 00:00:59.699 
out so with that being said let's get to

00:00:59.699 --> 00:00:59.990 
out so with that being said let's get to
it

00:00:59.990 --> 00:01:00.000 
it

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.119 
it
so<00:01:00.480> right<00:01:00.809> off<00:01:00.960> the<00:01:01.050> bat<00:01:01.230> the<00:01:01.410> first<00:01:01.649> thing<00:01:02.010> I

00:01:02.119 --> 00:01:02.129 
so right off the bat the first thing I

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:03.529 
so right off the bat the first thing I
noticed<00:01:02.460> about<00:01:02.579> action<00:01:03.059> was<00:01:03.270> the<00:01:03.390> nice

00:01:03.529 --> 00:01:03.539 
noticed about action was the nice

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:05.390 
noticed about action was the nice
looking<00:01:03.780> interface<00:01:04.229> that<00:01:04.710> was<00:01:04.799> also<00:01:05.070> easy<00:01:05.220> to

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:05.400 
looking interface that was also easy to

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:07.219 
looking interface that was also easy to
use<00:01:05.489> and<00:01:05.790> navigate<00:01:05.909> it<00:01:06.750> didn't<00:01:06.960> take<00:01:07.080> me<00:01:07.200> very

00:01:07.219 --> 00:01:07.229 
use and navigate it didn't take me very

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:08.660 
use and navigate it didn't take me very
long<00:01:07.439> to<00:01:07.590> figure<00:01:07.860> out<00:01:07.979> how<00:01:08.189> to<00:01:08.220> work<00:01:08.520> the

00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:08.670 
long to figure out how to work the

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:09.920 
long to figure out how to work the
program<00:01:08.820> and<00:01:09.210> allowed<00:01:09.390> me<00:01:09.540> to<00:01:09.570> delve<00:01:09.840> right

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:09.930 
program and allowed me to delve right

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:11.929 
program and allowed me to delve right
into<00:01:10.140> doing<00:01:10.619> some<00:01:10.770> recording<00:01:11.220> and<00:01:11.369> that's<00:01:11.700> big

00:01:11.929 --> 00:01:11.939 
into doing some recording and that's big

00:01:11.939 --> 00:01:13.250 
into doing some recording and that's big
with<00:01:12.119> me<00:01:12.240> if<00:01:12.450> it<00:01:12.600> takes<00:01:12.780> me<00:01:12.900> too<00:01:13.049> long<00:01:13.200> to

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:13.260 
with me if it takes me too long to

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:15.380 
with me if it takes me too long to
figure<00:01:13.650> out<00:01:13.770> how<00:01:13.890> to<00:01:13.950> use<00:01:14.280> a<00:01:14.310> program<00:01:14.850> then

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:15.390 
figure out how to use a program then

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:16.760 
figure out how to use a program then
I've<00:01:15.540> already<00:01:15.689> begun<00:01:15.930> to<00:01:16.140> lose<00:01:16.259> interest<00:01:16.590> in

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:16.770 
I've already begun to lose interest in

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:18.800 
I've already begun to lose interest in
even<00:01:16.890> using<00:01:17.340> it<00:01:17.430> the<00:01:17.759> main<00:01:17.939> screen<00:01:18.210> of<00:01:18.330> action

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:18.810 
even using it the main screen of action

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:21.080 
even using it the main screen of action
is<00:01:18.960> the<00:01:19.110> video<00:01:19.320> recording<00:01:19.920> tab<00:01:20.159> it<00:01:20.670> allows<00:01:20.909> you

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:21.090 
is the video recording tab it allows you

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:22.429 
is the video recording tab it allows you
to<00:01:21.210> switch<00:01:21.390> between<00:01:21.450> the<00:01:21.750> three<00:01:22.110> different

00:01:22.429 --> 00:01:22.439 
to switch between the three different

00:01:22.439 --> 00:01:25.190 
to switch between the three different
modes<00:01:22.650> games<00:01:23.520> active<00:01:24.119> desktop<00:01:24.299> and<00:01:24.869> active

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:25.200 
modes games active desktop and active

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:27.200 
modes games active desktop and active
desktop<00:01:25.350> region<00:01:25.920> it<00:01:26.400> also<00:01:26.549> shows<00:01:26.880> you<00:01:27.060> your

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:27.210 
desktop region it also shows you your

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:28.760 
desktop region it also shows you your
recordings<00:01:27.689> on<00:01:27.810> the<00:01:27.840> left<00:01:28.110> and<00:01:28.320> since<00:01:28.560> it's

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:28.770 
recordings on the left and since it's

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:30.020 
recordings on the left and since it's
probably<00:01:29.189> what<00:01:29.340> most<00:01:29.549> of<00:01:29.670> you<00:01:29.759> would<00:01:29.880> use

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:30.030 
probably what most of you would use

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:31.850 
probably what most of you would use
anyways<00:01:30.450> let's<00:01:31.020> get<00:01:31.170> right<00:01:31.259> into<00:01:31.439> the<00:01:31.560> regular

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:31.860 
anyways let's get right into the regular

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:33.980 
anyways let's get right into the regular
game<00:01:32.070> overlay<00:01:32.490> recording<00:01:32.970> mode<00:01:33.119> works<00:01:33.720> pretty

00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:33.990 
game overlay recording mode works pretty

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:35.120 
game overlay recording mode works pretty
much<00:01:34.110> like<00:01:34.259> you'd<00:01:34.619> imagine

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:35.130 
much like you'd imagine

00:04:17.399 --> 00:04:17.409 
the e X Pro version that has that but I

00:04:17.409 --> 00:04:18.550 
the e X Pro version that has that but I

it<00:04:30.919> very<00:04:31.130> fast<00:04:31.460> I<00:04:31.730> suppose<00:04:32.030> you<00:04:32.180> could<00:04:32.300> even

00:04:32.409 --> 00:04:32.419 
it very fast I suppose you could even

00:04:32.419 --> 00:04:35.710 
it very fast I suppose you could even
use<00:04:32.690> the<00:04:32.930> that<00:04:33.940> export<00:04:34.940> function<00:04:35.270> on<00:04:35.360> splashy

00:04:35.710 --> 00:04:35.720 
use the that export function on splashy

00:04:35.720 --> 00:04:39.640 
use the that export function on splashy
X<00:04:35.930> Pro<00:04:36.139> to<00:04:36.700> to<00:04:37.700> even<00:04:38.090> further<00:04:38.450> compress<00:04:38.960> the

X Pro to to even further compress the
files<00:04:40.370> from<00:04:40.760> action<00:04:41.360> so<00:04:41.630> I've<00:04:41.810> never<00:04:42.020> really

00:04:42.280 --> 00:04:42.290 
files from action so I've never really

00:04:42.290 --> 00:04:43.720 
files from action so I've never really
done<00:04:42.410> that<00:04:42.470> much<00:04:42.620> but<00:04:43.040> I<00:04:43.220> figured<00:04:43.639> I'd

00:04:43.720 --> 00:04:43.730 
done that much but I figured I'd

00:04:43.730 --> 00:04:44.620 
done that much but I figured I'd
mentioned<00:04:44.030> it<00:04:44.120> to<00:04:44.180> you<00:04:44.210> guys<00:04:44.330> because<00:04:44.480> I

00:04:44.620 --> 00:04:44.630 
mentioned it to you guys because I

trying to do vlogging or maybe you just

00:04:49.070 --> 00:04:51.850 
trying to do vlogging or maybe you just
want<00:04:49.460> a<00:04:49.700> usable<00:04:50.450> format<00:04:50.810> that<00:04:51.380> works<00:04:51.560> better

00:04:51.850 --> 00:04:51.860 
want a usable format that works better

00:04:51.860 --> 00:04:54.640 
want a usable format that works better
in<00:04:52.100> video<00:04:52.340> editors<00:04:52.930> from<00:04:53.930> your<00:04:54.080> iPhone<00:04:54.410> and

00:04:54.640 --> 00:04:54.650 
in video editors from your iPhone and

00:04:54.650 --> 00:04:56.080 
in video editors from your iPhone and
that<00:04:55.040> was<00:04:55.190> the<00:04:55.280> problem<00:04:55.550> that<00:04:55.580> I<00:04:55.700> have<00:04:55.910> that

00:04:56.080 --> 00:04:56.090 
that was the problem that I have that

00:04:56.090 --> 00:04:57.879 
that was the problem that I have that
the<00:04:56.450> dot<00:04:56.630> MOV<00:04:56.870> didn't<00:04:57.260> really<00:04:57.410> work<00:04:57.560> that<00:04:57.590> well

00:04:57.879 --> 00:04:57.889 
the dot MOV didn't really work that well

00:04:57.889 --> 00:05:00.550 
the dot MOV didn't really work that well
so<00:04:58.550> yeah<00:04:59.419> that<00:04:59.750> program<00:05:00.110> does<00:05:00.260> that<00:05:00.440> really

00:05:00.550 --> 00:05:00.560 
so yeah that program does that really

00:05:00.560 --> 00:05:02.050
