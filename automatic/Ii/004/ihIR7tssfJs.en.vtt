00:02:33.310 --> 00:02:54.070 
outer tie rod as well so I'm going to
use<00:02:33.900> a<00:02:34.900> pickle<00:02:35.709> fork<00:02:35.980> to<00:02:36.280> separate

00:02:54.070 --> 00:02:54.080 

00:02:54.080 --> 00:02:56.290 

best<00:02:54.860> way<00:02:54.980> to<00:02:55.010> go<00:02:55.160> about<00:02:55.250> this<00:02:55.520> is<00:02:55.700> to<00:02:55.820> get<00:02:56.090> the

00:02:56.290 --> 00:02:56.300 
best way to go about this is to get the

00:02:56.300 --> 00:03:01.110 
best way to go about this is to get the
rent<00:02:56.480> on<00:02:56.600> from<00:02:56.870> underneath<00:02:57.170> and<00:02:57.730> then<00:02:58.730> push

00:03:01.110 --> 00:03:01.120 
rent on from underneath and then push

00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:10.990 
rent on from underneath and then push
that<00:03:02.120> should<00:03:02.570> break<00:03:03.220> free<00:03:09.700> I'm<00:03:10.700> just<00:03:10.850> going<00:03:10.970> to

00:03:10.990 --> 00:03:11.000 
that should break free I'm just going to

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:12.790 
that should break free I'm just going to
kind<00:03:11.150> of<00:03:11.180> speed<00:03:11.390> up<00:03:11.420> as<00:03:11.690> I<00:03:11.780> pull<00:03:12.050> that<00:03:12.080> out<00:03:12.230> you

00:03:12.790 --> 00:03:12.800 
kind of speed up as I pull that out you

00:03:12.800 --> 00:03:14.200 
kind of speed up as I pull that out you
want<00:03:12.980> to<00:03:13.040> make<00:03:13.160> sure<00:03:13.190> that<00:03:13.460> your<00:03:13.580> outer<00:03:13.760> tie

00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:14.210 
want to make sure that your outer tie

00:03:14.210 --> 00:03:17.920 
want to make sure that your outer tie
rod<00:03:14.240> spins<00:03:15.020> with<00:03:15.650> the<00:03:16.640> wrench<00:03:16.880> so<00:03:17.570> the<00:03:17.780> whole

00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:17.930 
rod spins with the wrench so the whole

00:03:17.930 --> 00:03:21.130 
rod spins with the wrench so the whole
assembly<00:03:18.380> spins<00:03:18.710> and<00:03:19.040> you<00:03:19.340> don't<00:03:19.960> shorten<00:03:20.960> or

00:03:21.130 --> 00:03:21.140 
assembly spins and you don't shorten or

00:03:21.140 --> 00:03:23.260 
assembly spins and you don't shorten or
lengthen<00:03:21.220> the<00:03:22.220> tie<00:03:22.430> rod<00:03:22.670> the<00:03:22.880> inner<00:03:23.060> and<00:03:23.210> outer

00:03:23.260 --> 00:03:23.270 
lengthen the tie rod the inner and outer

00:03:23.270 --> 00:03:28.309 
lengthen the tie rod the inner and outer
tie<00:03:23.600> rod<00:03:23.630> assembly

00:03:28.309 --> 00:03:28.319 

00:03:28.319 --> 00:03:34.309 

okay<00:03:29.319> so<00:03:29.909> there's<00:03:30.909> your<00:03:30.939> whole<00:03:31.150> assembly<00:03:31.599> out

00:03:34.309 --> 00:03:34.319 

00:03:34.319 --> 00:03:38.580 

okay<00:03:35.319> so<00:03:35.349> you<00:03:35.500> can<00:03:35.620> see<00:03:35.650> here<00:03:36.010> I've<00:03:36.099> got<00:03:36.129> my<00:03:37.590> old

00:03:38.580 --> 00:03:38.590 
okay so you can see here I've got my old

00:03:38.590 --> 00:03:41.099 
okay so you can see here I've got my old
assembly<00:03:39.280> inner<00:03:39.879> tie<00:03:40.090> rod<00:03:40.120> outer<00:03:40.480> tie<00:03:40.659> rod<00:03:40.689> and

00:03:41.099 --> 00:03:41.109 
assembly inner tie rod outer tie rod and

00:03:41.109 --> 00:03:43.920 
assembly inner tie rod outer tie rod and
I<00:03:41.500> want<00:03:41.680> to<00:03:41.739> measure<00:03:41.920> right<00:03:42.250> from<00:03:42.519> the<00:03:42.689> edge<00:03:43.689> of

00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:43.930 
I want to measure right from the edge of

00:03:43.930 --> 00:03:47.610 
I want to measure right from the edge of
this<00:03:44.109> surface<00:03:44.650> here<00:03:45.040> right<00:03:45.790> to<00:03:45.909> the<00:03:46.030> end<00:03:46.590> okay

00:03:47.610 --> 00:03:47.620 
this surface here right to the end okay

00:03:47.620 --> 00:03:50.309 
this surface here right to the end okay
and<00:03:48.250> I<00:03:48.310> just<00:03:48.489> taking<00:03:48.760> my<00:03:48.879> new<00:03:49.090> inner<00:03:49.959> tie<00:03:50.260> rod

00:03:50.309 --> 00:03:50.319 
and I just taking my new inner tie rod

00:03:50.319 --> 00:03:52.550 
and I just taking my new inner tie rod
now<00:03:50.680> to<00:03:50.739> tie<00:03:51.010> rod<00:03:51.220> and<00:03:51.459> I<00:03:51.640> put<00:03:51.849> them<00:03:51.939> together

00:03:52.550 --> 00:03:52.560 
now to tie rod and I put them together

00:03:52.560 --> 00:03:55.770 
now to tie rod and I put them together
just<00:03:53.560> to<00:03:53.650> compare<00:03:54.099> and<00:03:54.430> this<00:03:55.359> will<00:03:55.480> just<00:03:55.599> give

00:03:55.770 --> 00:03:55.780 
just to compare and this will just give

00:03:55.780 --> 00:03:58.979 
just to compare and this will just give
you<00:03:55.870> a<00:03:55.930> good<00:03:56.109> preliminary<00:03:56.829> alignment<00:03:57.989> will

00:03:58.979 --> 00:03:58.989 
you a good preliminary alignment will

00:03:58.989 --> 00:04:02.640 
you a good preliminary alignment will
put<00:03:59.200> this<00:03:59.349> nut<00:03:59.590> a<00:03:59.980> little<00:04:00.519> closer<00:04:00.930> and<00:04:01.930> we<00:04:02.530> can

00:04:02.640 --> 00:04:02.650 
put this nut a little closer and we can

00:04:02.650 --> 00:04:04.979 
put this nut a little closer and we can
put<00:04:02.829> it<00:04:02.920> together<00:04:03.040> now<00:04:03.430> and<00:04:03.790> it'll<00:04:04.629> be<00:04:04.689> a<00:04:04.780> good

00:04:04.979 --> 00:04:04.989 
put it together now and it'll be a good

00:04:04.989 --> 00:04:06.539 
put it together now and it'll be a good
culinary<00:04:05.200> alignment<00:04:05.859> until<00:04:06.099> you<00:04:06.159> get<00:04:06.370> your

00:04:06.539 --> 00:04:06.549 
culinary alignment until you get your

00:04:06.549 --> 00:04:08.399 
culinary alignment until you get your
feet'll<00:04:07.389> to<00:04:07.510> a<00:04:07.540> shop<00:04:07.840> where<00:04:08.049> you<00:04:08.139> can<00:04:08.260> get<00:04:08.349> a

00:04:08.399 --> 00:04:08.409 
feet'll to a shop where you can get a

00:04:08.409 --> 00:04:16.729 
feet'll to a shop where you can get a
real<00:04:08.620> line<00:04:14.760> so<00:04:15.760> I'm<00:04:15.819> just<00:04:15.970> leaving<00:04:16.180> my<00:04:16.479> nut

00:04:16.729 --> 00:04:16.739 
real line so I'm just leaving my nut

00:04:16.739 --> 00:04:21.810 
real line so I'm just leaving my nut
right<00:04:17.739> there<00:04:18.130> and<00:04:20.190> spinning<00:04:21.190> my<00:04:21.310> outer<00:04:21.489> tire

00:04:21.810 --> 00:04:21.820 
right there and spinning my outer tire

00:04:21.820 --> 00:04:25.499 
right there and spinning my outer tire
off<00:04:23.370> okay<00:04:24.370> the<00:04:24.520> nut<00:04:24.699> marks<00:04:24.970> the<00:04:25.090> place<00:04:25.300> where

00:04:25.499 --> 00:04:25.509 
off okay the nut marks the place where

00:04:25.509 --> 00:04:27.420 
off okay the nut marks the place where
your<00:04:25.630> tie<00:04:25.780> rod<00:04:25.810> was<00:04:26.199> and<00:04:26.560> then<00:04:26.949> taking<00:04:27.280> off

00:04:27.420 --> 00:04:27.430 
your tie rod was and then taking off

00:04:27.430 --> 00:04:28.980 
your tie rod was and then taking off
that<00:04:27.610> outer<00:04:27.789> tie<00:04:28.030> rod<00:04:28.060> just<00:04:28.419> makes<00:04:28.599> it<00:04:28.690> easier

00:04:28.980 --> 00:04:28.990 
that outer tie rod just makes it easier

00:04:28.990 --> 00:04:54.839 
that outer tie rod just makes it easier
to<00:04:29.020> get<00:04:29.169> the<00:04:29.229> inner<00:04:29.440> one<00:04:29.650> on<00:04:35.550> my<00:04:36.550> rod<00:04:37.300> on

00:04:54.839 --> 00:04:54.849 

00:04:54.849 --> 00:04:57.400 

speed<00:04:55.849> it<00:04:55.970> up<00:04:56.030> here<00:04:56.270> as<00:04:56.360> I<00:04:56.449> use<00:04:56.629> the<00:04:56.810> wrench<00:04:57.050> to

00:04:57.400 --> 00:04:57.410 
speed it up here as I use the wrench to

00:04:57.410 --> 00:05:18.000 
speed it up here as I use the wrench to
tighten<00:04:57.710> the<00:04:57.919> tie<00:04:58.069> rod<00:04:58.310> up

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:18.010 

00:05:18.010 --> 00:05:20.320 

and<00:05:19.010> I<00:05:19.160> can<00:05:19.310> put<00:05:19.430> my<00:05:19.520> outer<00:05:19.670> tie<00:05:19.910> rod<00:05:19.940> right

00:05:20.320 --> 00:05:20.330 
and I can put my outer tie rod right

00:05:20.330 --> 00:05:23.430 
and I can put my outer tie rod right
back<00:05:20.540> on<00:05:20.860> and<00:05:21.860> go<00:05:21.980> right<00:05:22.130> up<00:05:22.160> to<00:05:22.280> the<00:05:22.430> nut<00:05:22.700> you

00:05:23.430 --> 00:05:23.440 
back on and go right up to the nut you

00:05:23.440 --> 00:05:27.370 
back on and go right up to the nut you
know<00:05:24.440> just<00:05:24.680> fast<00:05:24.920> forward<00:05:25.220> here<00:05:25.250> as<00:05:25.670> I<00:05:26.380> put
