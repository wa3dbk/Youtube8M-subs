fat you this one you have the same
situation<00:01:06.380> but<00:01:07.380> I'm<00:01:07.590> gonna<00:01:07.830> take<00:01:08.130> the<00:01:08.250> volume

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:08.490 
situation but I'm gonna take the volume

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:15.050 
situation but I'm gonna take the volume
out<00:01:10.460> and<00:01:12.409> the<00:01:13.409> guy<00:01:13.560> stands<00:01:14.310> out<00:01:14.520> here<00:01:14.790> for<00:01:15.030> a

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:15.060 
out and the guy stands out here for a

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:17.359 
out and the guy stands out here for a
while<00:01:15.360> but<00:01:16.110> the<00:01:16.320> clouds<00:01:16.590> move<00:01:16.890> the<00:01:17.070> entire

00:01:17.359 --> 00:01:17.369 
while but the clouds move the entire

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:20.719 
while but the clouds move the entire
time<00:01:17.700> so<00:01:17.909> I'm<00:01:18.689> gonna<00:01:18.840> find<00:01:19.170> the<00:01:19.350> position<00:01:19.860> that

00:01:20.719 --> 00:01:20.729 
time so I'm gonna find the position that

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:32.250 
time so I'm gonna find the position that
he<00:01:21.330> turns<00:01:21.659> around<00:01:21.840> and<00:01:22.140> drops<00:01:22.439> the<00:01:22.680> gate

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:32.260 

00:01:32.260 --> 00:01:34.860 

okay<00:01:32.920> so<00:01:33.040> here<00:01:33.310> it's<00:01:33.460> right<00:01:33.550> here<00:01:33.820> so<00:01:34.600> I'm

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:34.870 
okay so here it's right here so I'm

00:01:34.870 --> 00:01:40.590 
okay so here it's right here so I'm
gonna<00:01:35.020> split<00:01:35.410> it<00:01:35.590> right<00:01:35.620> here<00:01:38.070> and<00:01:39.450> then<00:01:40.450> I'm

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:40.600 
gonna split it right here and then I'm

00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:44.250 
gonna split it right here and then I'm
gonna<00:01:40.780> speed<00:01:41.140> just<00:01:41.530> this<00:01:41.680> part<00:01:41.980> up<00:01:42.300> so<00:01:43.300> I'm

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:44.260 
gonna speed just this part up so I'm

00:01:44.260 --> 00:01:45.420 
gonna speed just this part up so I'm
gonna<00:01:44.380> go<00:01:44.590> one<00:01:44.740> hundred<00:01:44.950> eight<00:01:45.400> hundred

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:45.430 
gonna go one hundred eight hundred

00:01:45.430 --> 00:01:49.230 
gonna go one hundred eight hundred
percent<00:01:46.120> and<00:01:46.500> then<00:01:48.000> that'll<00:01:49.000> go<00:01:49.120> to<00:01:49.150> the

00:01:49.230 --> 00:01:49.240 
percent and then that'll go to the

00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:55.080 
percent and then that'll go to the
beginning<00:01:49.450> so<00:01:50.070> now<00:01:51.540> ii<00:01:53.520> watch<00:01:54.520> how<00:01:54.730> cool<00:01:54.880> this

00:01:55.080 --> 00:01:55.090 
beginning so now ii watch how cool this

00:01:55.090 --> 00:02:03.150 
beginning so now ii watch how cool this
looks<00:01:57.120> the<00:01:58.120> clouds<00:01:58.450> are<00:01:58.690> moving<00:02:01.080> and<00:02:02.080> you<00:02:03.010> can

00:02:03.150 --> 00:02:03.160 
looks the clouds are moving and you can

00:02:03.160 --> 00:02:05.610 
looks the clouds are moving and you can
see<00:02:03.400> it<00:02:03.550> going<00:02:04.330> over<00:02:04.570> the<00:02:04.750> mountains<00:02:04.900> but<00:02:05.440> he

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:05.620 
see it going over the mountains but he

00:02:05.620 --> 00:02:07.170 
see it going over the mountains but he
just<00:02:05.830> stand<00:02:06.130> still<00:02:06.370> and<00:02:06.430> moves<00:02:06.700> a<00:02:06.820> little<00:02:06.940> bit

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:07.180 
just stand still and moves a little bit

00:02:07.180 --> 00:02:10.550 
just stand still and moves a little bit
and<00:02:07.360> then<00:02:07.930> once<00:02:08.200> it<00:02:08.350> comes<00:02:08.590> to<00:02:08.740> race<00:02:08.920> time

00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:10.560 
and then once it comes to race time

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:16.130 
and then once it comes to race time
you'll<00:02:11.560> see<00:02:11.970> him<00:02:12.970> walk<00:02:13.300> in<00:02:13.330> and<00:02:14.230> regular<00:02:15.100> speed

00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:16.140 
you'll see him walk in and regular speed

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:20.370 
you'll see him walk in and regular speed
and<00:02:17.370> drop<00:02:18.370> the<00:02:18.520> gate<00:02:18.990> so<00:02:19.990> that's<00:02:20.170> something

00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:20.380 
and drop the gate so that's something

00:02:20.380 --> 00:02:22.770 
and drop the gate so that's something
else<00:02:20.530> you<00:02:20.680> can<00:02:20.860> do<00:02:20.980> now<00:02:21.940> I'm<00:02:22.150> gonna<00:02:22.270> cover<00:02:22.570> it

00:02:22.770 --> 00:02:22.780 
else you can do now I'm gonna cover it

00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:24.060 
else you can do now I'm gonna cover it

00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:43.930 
these and you can see how it just boosts

00:02:43.930 --> 00:02:46.620 
these and you can see how it just boosts
the<00:02:44.020> colors<00:02:44.350> but<00:02:44.980> with<00:02:45.160> this<00:02:45.310> GoPro<00:02:45.610> it's<00:02:46.390> not

00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:46.630 
the colors but with this GoPro it's not

00:02:46.630 --> 00:02:50.630 
the colors but with this GoPro it's not
the<00:02:46.780> best<00:02:46.930> you<00:02:47.140> turn<00:02:47.320> it<00:02:47.410> all<00:02:47.530> the<00:02:47.560> way<00:02:47.680> up<00:02:47.890> so

00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:53.640 

that's<00:02:51.640> what<00:02:51.880> I<00:02:51.940> think<00:02:52.209> looks<00:02:52.330> better<00:02:52.620> with<00:02:53.620> a

00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:53.650 
that's what I think looks better with a

00:02:53.650 --> 00:02:55.350 
that's what I think looks better with a
little<00:02:53.739> bit<00:02:54.160> more<00:02:54.340> red<00:02:54.610> than<00:02:54.640> everything<00:02:55.030> else

00:02:55.350 --> 00:02:55.360 
little bit more red than everything else

00:02:55.360 --> 00:02:58.229 
little bit more red than everything else
and<00:02:56.170> a<00:02:56.350> little<00:02:56.650> bit<00:02:56.800> of<00:02:56.890> blue<00:02:57.070> so<00:02:57.790> the<00:02:57.940> sun's

00:02:58.229 --> 00:02:58.239 
and a little bit of blue so the sun's

00:02:58.239 --> 00:03:00.270 
and a little bit of blue so the sun's
boosted<00:02:59.020> now<00:02:59.410> say<00:02:59.620> you<00:02:59.680> want<00:02:59.920> to<00:02:59.980> do<00:03:00.130> your

in<00:03:48.379> the<00:03:49.040> contrast<00:03:49.670> a<00:03:49.819> little<00:03:49.849> bit<00:03:50.620> it<00:03:51.620> will

00:03:51.759 --> 00:03:51.769 
in the contrast a little bit it will

00:03:51.769 --> 00:03:56.080 
in the contrast a little bit it will
only<00:03:51.920> show<00:03:52.900> really<00:03:53.900> thick<00:03:54.500> colors<00:03:55.340> like<00:03:55.610> you
