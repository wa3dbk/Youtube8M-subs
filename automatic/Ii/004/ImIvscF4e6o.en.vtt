00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.529
 hi friends today I'm going to talk about a 

00:00:02.310 --> 00:00:07.710
 monster inclusive of monsters laws is 

00:00:04.529 --> 00:00:10.139
 is about the carazo monster this mount 

00:00:07.710 --> 00:00:13.620
 Exclusive is an epic-type monster 

00:00:10.139 --> 00:00:16.080
 of the elements thunder and darkness and 

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:20.310
 was available through a part 

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:24.080
 special on April 25, 2014 by 

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:27.520
 a price of 100 gems for a while 

00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:29.650
 50 hours limit 

00:00:27.520 --> 00:00:32.830
 but you could also get it in a way 

00:00:29.650 --> 00:00:35.370
 free through the special dungeon 

00:00:32.830 --> 00:00:38.890
 demonstrable carazo footprint james mobile 

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:40.930
 if I managed to overcome all the levels 

00:00:38.890 --> 00:00:43.870
 until reaching the penultimate level of this 

00:00:40.930 --> 00:00:47.110
 more cute was given to you as a reward 

00:00:43.870 --> 00:00:49.300
 this monster exclusive this monster 

00:00:47.110 --> 00:00:52.870
 it takes to explode in just 5 

00:00:49.300 --> 00:00:56.230
 minutes and as I told you, you can only 

00:00:52.870 --> 00:00:57.760
 get in those two ways since this 

00:00:56.230 --> 00:01:01.030
 monster can not be obtained by 

00:00:57.760 --> 00:01:04.119

00:01:06.670 --> 00:01:12.850
 any of its two habitats that can 

00:01:09.850 --> 00:01:15.850
 be a habitat of the thunder element or the 

00:01:12.850 --> 00:01:20.759
 darkness element we will place 

00:01:15.850 --> 00:01:20.759
 here in this thunder element habitat 

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:25.980
 and once placed in their respective 

00:01:23.010 --> 00:01:28.140
 habitat we can feed it as 

00:01:25.980 --> 00:01:30.750

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:33.030

00:01:54.850 --> 00:01:59.860
 carazo monster in level 4 and now 

00:01:57.580 --> 00:02:02.470
 let's feed it until it reaches 

00:01:59.860 --> 00:02:05.159
 Level 7 to see the ability to be 

00:02:02.470 --> 00:02:05.159

 ability 

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:42.220

00:02:51.980 --> 00:02:58.210

00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:04.720
 ra 

00:03:08.099 --> 00:03:13.870
 at level 15 we will have to come from here to 

00:03:11.409 --> 00:03:17.520
 replace a new skill we're going to 

00:03:13.870 --> 00:03:19.980
 replace this physical skill 

00:03:17.520 --> 00:03:24.400
 if a new skill was added 

00:03:19.980 --> 00:03:26.860
 good guy called sharp edge 

00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:29.799
 now we are going to feed him until 

00:03:26.860 --> 00:03:34.470
 reach level 20 to see his last 

00:03:29.799 --> 00:03:34.470
 phase of evolution and final appearance 

00:03:37.970 --> 00:03:40.970
 Clear 

00:03:43.530 --> 00:03:46.530
 do not 

00:03:49.920 --> 00:03:56.760
 at level 20 it will have evolved by 

00:03:52.590 --> 00:03:58.950
 last time and it will acquire its adult phase and 

00:03:56.760 --> 00:04:01.050
 definitively we will also have to 

00:03:58.950 --> 00:04:04.540
 replace or discard an ability 

00:04:01.050 --> 00:04:07.000
 let's replace this skill 

00:04:04.540 --> 00:04:10.000
 and the type skill will be added 

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:12.550

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:15.520
 Katana 

00:04:12.550 --> 00:04:18.040
 good friends that's the appearance and the 

00:04:15.520 --> 00:04:20.799
 latest evolution of the carazo monster in 

00:04:18.040 --> 00:04:23.770
 level 20 that his adult phase and 

00:04:20.799 --> 00:04:27.310
 definitive and if we continue feeding it 

00:04:23.770 --> 00:04:32.710
 the only thing he will do is increase his 

00:04:27.310 --> 00:04:34.810
 power life and energy 

00:04:32.710 --> 00:04:37.690
 well this monster is no longer found 

00:04:34.810 --> 00:04:40.270
 available in monsters laws but if 

00:04:37.690 --> 00:04:43.810
 you could not get it only 

00:04:40.270 --> 00:04:46.480
 wait until it appears again in a 

00:04:43.810 --> 00:04:50.080
 special dungeon and so they can 

00:04:46.480 --> 00:04:52.090
 win for free or maybe maybe 

00:04:50.080 --> 00:04:55.330
 may appear in a special offer 

00:04:52.090 --> 00:04:58.630
