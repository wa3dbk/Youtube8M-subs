00:02:27.059 --> 00:02:27.069 
let's see and i think they're more of an

00:02:27.069 --> 00:02:33.270 
let's see and i think they're more of an
on-demand<00:02:27.430> than<00:02:27.879> a<00:02:28.000> a<00:02:28.209> live<00:02:28.629> TV<00:02:28.930> feed<00:02:32.129> it<00:02:33.129> works

00:02:33.270 --> 00:02:33.280 
on-demand than a a live TV feed it works

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:37.170 
on-demand than a a live TV feed it works
pretty<00:02:33.430> good<00:02:33.549> let's<00:02:34.120> see<00:02:34.269> if<00:02:34.450> i<00:02:34.540> turn<00:02:34.599> it<00:02:36.180> it

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:37.180 
pretty good let's see if i turn it it

00:02:37.180 --> 00:02:38.849 
pretty good let's see if i turn it it
does<00:02:37.359> recognize<00:02:37.810> the<00:02:37.840> accelerometer<00:02:38.620> so

00:02:38.849 --> 00:02:38.859 
does recognize the accelerometer so

00:02:38.859 --> 00:02:40.679 
does recognize the accelerometer so
that's<00:02:39.010> a<00:02:39.099> great<00:02:39.310> feature<00:02:39.909> to<00:02:40.060> have<00:02:40.239> so<00:02:40.480> just

00:02:40.679 --> 00:02:40.689 
that's a great feature to have so just

00:02:40.689 --> 00:02:43.589 
that's a great feature to have so just
close<00:02:41.349> out<00:02:41.590> this<00:02:41.909> will<00:02:42.909> just<00:02:43.090> go<00:02:43.390> to<00:02:43.450> the

00:02:43.589 --> 00:02:43.599 
close out this will just go to the

00:02:43.599 --> 00:02:45.690 
close out this will just go to the
sprint<00:02:43.900> radio<00:02:44.290> so<00:02:45.069> you<00:02:45.129> have<00:02:45.220> many<00:02:45.370> different

00:03:45.030 --> 00:03:45.040 
sprint based sim card it won't actually

00:03:45.040 --> 00:03:47.099 
sprint based sim card it won't actually
work<00:03:45.459> but<00:03:45.940> when<00:03:46.090> i<00:03:46.120> was<00:03:46.180> able<00:03:46.449> to<00:03:46.659> plug<00:03:46.870> in<00:03:46.989> my

00:03:47.099 --> 00:03:47.109 
work but when i was able to plug in my

00:03:47.109 --> 00:03:49.080 
work but when i was able to plug in my
AT&amp;T<00:03:47.739> sim<00:03:48.010> card<00:03:48.220> it<00:03:48.310> was<00:03:48.400> able<00:03:48.669> to<00:03:48.760> recognize

00:03:49.080 --> 00:03:49.090 
AT&amp;T sim card it was able to recognize

00:03:49.090 --> 00:03:50.849 
AT&amp;T sim card it was able to recognize
the<00:03:49.239> network<00:03:49.540> but<00:03:49.720> for<00:03:50.409> some<00:03:50.560> reason<00:03:50.829> it

00:03:50.849 --> 00:03:50.859 
the network but for some reason it

00:03:50.859 --> 00:03:52.879 
the network but for some reason it
wasn't<00:03:51.040> able<00:03:51.250> to<00:03:51.489> get<00:03:51.940> me<00:03:52.120> any<00:03:52.239> signal<00:03:52.629> so

00:03:52.879 --> 00:03:52.889 
wasn't able to get me any signal so

00:03:52.889 --> 00:03:55.830 
wasn't able to get me any signal so
maybe<00:03:53.889> it<00:03:54.040> doesn't<00:03:54.190> work<00:03:54.430> on<00:03:54.609> us<00:03:54.909> networks<00:03:55.659> or

00:03:55.830 --> 00:03:55.840 
maybe it doesn't work on us networks or

00:03:55.840 --> 00:03:57.089 
maybe it doesn't work on us networks or
something<00:03:56.139> so<00:03:56.260> i'll<00:03:56.379> just<00:03:56.409> put<00:03:56.709> it<00:03:56.799> back<00:03:56.949> to

00:03:57.089 --> 00:03:57.099 
something so i'll just put it back to

00:03:57.099 --> 00:03:59.520
