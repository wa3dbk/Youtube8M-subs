00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:01.620 
see levels are rated by a three-star

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:03.529 
see levels are rated by a three-star
system<00:01:01.649> and<00:01:02.309> you<00:01:02.520> unlock<00:01:02.789> levels<00:01:02.969> as<00:01:03.239> you<00:01:03.329> go

00:01:03.529 --> 00:01:03.539 
system and you unlock levels as you go

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:05.479 
system and you unlock levels as you go
each<00:01:04.170> level<00:01:04.409> is<00:01:04.589> a<00:01:04.650> different<00:01:04.680> pattern<00:01:05.189> which

00:01:05.479 --> 00:01:05.489 
each level is a different pattern which

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:07.160 
each level is a different pattern which
represents<00:01:05.970> a<00:01:06.000> puzzle<00:01:06.330> so<00:01:06.810> in<00:01:06.869> this<00:01:06.960> case

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:07.170 
represents a puzzle so in this case

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:09.620 
represents a puzzle so in this case
we'll<00:01:07.350> go<00:01:07.439> with<00:01:07.560> level<00:01:07.830> two<00:01:08.240> you<00:01:09.240> can<00:01:09.360> see<00:01:09.479> here

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:09.630 
we'll go with level two you can see here

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:11.210 
we'll go with level two you can see here
as<00:01:09.689> soon<00:01:09.869> as<00:01:09.960> the<00:01:10.020> game<00:01:10.140> starts<00:01:10.530> you<00:01:10.830> use<00:01:11.040> your

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:11.220 
as soon as the game starts you use your

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:13.760 
as soon as the game starts you use your
finger<00:01:11.490> to<00:01:11.520> draw<00:01:12.479> a<00:01:12.510> line<00:01:12.900> essentially<00:01:13.530> and

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:13.770 
finger to draw a line essentially and

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:17.840 
finger to draw a line essentially and
grab<00:01:14.430> a<00:01:14.880> ball<00:01:15.540> in<00:01:15.810> order<00:01:15.960> to<00:01:16.520> match<00:01:17.520> it<00:01:17.729> with

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:17.850 
grab a ball in order to match it with

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:18.980 
grab a ball in order to match it with
the<00:01:17.909> corresponding<00:01:18.119> color<00:01:18.509> so<00:01:18.689> you<00:01:18.780> can<00:01:18.869> see

00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:18.990 
the corresponding color so you can see

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:20.539 
the corresponding color so you can see
there<00:01:19.140> in<00:01:19.200> the<00:01:19.290> early<00:01:19.860> beginning<00:01:20.189> I<00:01:20.340> was<00:01:20.430> lucky

00:01:20.539 --> 00:01:20.549 
there in the early beginning I was lucky

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:22.070 
there in the early beginning I was lucky
enough<00:01:20.640> to<00:01:20.820> get<00:01:20.880> a<00:01:20.970> huge<00:01:21.210> combo<00:01:21.509> there<00:01:21.869> so

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:22.080 
enough to get a huge combo there so

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:23.749 
enough to get a huge combo there so
basically<00:01:22.590> you<00:01:22.979> want<00:01:23.040> to<00:01:23.130> match<00:01:23.280> three<00:01:23.580> of<00:01:23.670> a

00:01:23.749 --> 00:01:23.759 
basically you want to match three of a

00:01:23.759 --> 00:01:26.030 
basically you want to match three of a
kind<00:01:23.790> so<00:01:24.210> you<00:01:24.689> have<00:01:24.869> two<00:01:25.200> actions<00:01:25.619> you<00:01:25.830> have

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:26.040 
kind so you have two actions you have

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:28.370 
kind so you have two actions you have
one<00:01:26.700> option<00:01:26.850> to<00:01:27.119> retract<00:01:27.540> foe<00:01:27.840> and<00:01:28.110> then<00:01:28.259> the

00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:28.380 
one option to retract foe and then the

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:30.440
