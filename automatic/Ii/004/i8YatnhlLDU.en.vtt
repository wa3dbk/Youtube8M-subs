00:00:00.199 --> 00:00:06.509
 Welcome to the bonus videos 

00:00:03.540 --> 00:00:08.069
 or the free play videos of never 

00:00:06.509 --> 00:00:10.889
 alone the second episode 

00:00:08.069 --> 00:00:14.000
 Here begins directly with the heartbeat 

00:00:10.889 --> 00:00:14.000
 the community 

00:01:54.560 --> 00:02:01.320
 Well, I actually believe that 

00:01:57.030 --> 00:02:02.580
 the drum not only in alaska so 

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:04.670
 is common but actually in 

00:02:02.580 --> 00:02:06.960
 almost all cultures I mean you can 

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:10.470
 Then just go down and then 

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:11.940
 just the native americans themselves 

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:13.740
 Watching indians with their know-how 

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:17.280
 trolling or whatever 

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:19.200
 exactly then in all others 

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:21.120
 You will find cultures drumming everywhere 

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:24.330
 also in japan I think it depends 

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:27.570
 together that it is one of the 

00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:29.670
 easiest instruments to take stock 

00:02:27.570 --> 00:02:31.200
 where to strike and then you have 

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:33.030
 determined someday determined human 

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:34.709
 the thing is what i hit on it 

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:35.940
 somehow that kind of hole then eats 

00:02:34.709 --> 00:02:38.550
 that sounds very different 

00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:40.400
 and then that was together with the 

00:02:38.550 --> 00:02:43.620
 human voice destined to the 

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:45.780
 simplest and most common 

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:48.239
 instrument that everything else then what 

00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:50.519
 happened with epic core brushing 

00:02:48.239 --> 00:02:51.780
 or so then they say excited about it 

00:02:50.519 --> 00:02:53.040
 have and then there are really different 

00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:55.230
 sounds have been made from it 

00:02:53.040 --> 00:03:01.230
 that's all because that 's it 

00:02:55.230 --> 00:03:03.959
 high-tech the drum not not in vain 

00:03:01.230 --> 00:03:08.040
 the drummer is an important one 

00:03:03.959 --> 00:03:09.989
 part of it so we take a look 

00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:12.750
 It's up to that little folk 

00:03:09.989 --> 00:03:16.760
 This has us in the last 

00:03:12.750 --> 00:03:16.760
 followed so a bit heated 

00:04:17.870 --> 00:04:23.100
 to match thematically 

00:04:20.100 --> 00:04:25.140
 the drum and the little folk this 

00:04:23.100 --> 00:04:27.480
 this little people are also available in all 

00:04:25.140 --> 00:04:28.800
 cultures again in Germany 

00:04:27.480 --> 00:04:30.420
 yes there are the heinzelmännchen here in 

00:04:28.800 --> 00:04:33.000
 Cologne even gives a small statue 

00:04:30.420 --> 00:04:35.430
 the cathedral of cologne the history of 

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:36.810
 the little dog manages to do that 

00:04:35.430 --> 00:04:38.700
 real fairy tale where the 

00:04:36.810 --> 00:04:40.470
 hanzelmännchen always work at night 

00:04:38.700 --> 00:04:41.820
 do it and the woman is so curious 

00:04:40.470 --> 00:04:43.530
 and always looks and always wants to know 

00:04:41.820 --> 00:04:45.000
 who is doing the work there and the 

00:04:43.530 --> 00:04:46.590
 heinz girls just do not want to see 

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:50.100
 So here too, parallel to the 

00:04:46.590 --> 00:04:54.270
 what we have here is that you just that 

00:04:50.100 --> 00:04:57.510
 the little people somehow magical powers 

00:04:54.270 --> 00:04:59.310
 has been extremely busy or just here 

00:04:57.510 --> 00:05:01.890
 is especially strong and only then 

00:04:59.310 --> 00:05:04.410
 seen seen if it too 

00:05:01.890 --> 00:05:06.120
 then wants to be seen and the woman 

00:05:04.410 --> 00:05:10.830
 which he believes I peas or something 

00:05:06.120 --> 00:05:12.360
 somehow that was what I believe 

00:05:10.830 --> 00:05:14.340
 peas on the stairs and then 

00:05:12.360 --> 00:05:16.919
 wakes up and then actually 

00:05:14.340 --> 00:05:19.470
 this little little dog looks and 

00:05:16.919 --> 00:05:20.910
 but then never come back and never 

00:05:19.470 --> 00:05:23.900
 do the work again 

00:05:20.910 --> 00:05:29.270
 of course we have in ireland too 

00:05:23.900 --> 00:05:32.639
 little stories or 

00:05:29.270 --> 00:05:34.619
 Kobolde the back and forth everywhere 

00:05:32.639 --> 00:05:35.939
 Wenzel and then always so nonsense 

00:05:34.619 --> 00:05:37.889
 I think that has something to do with it 

00:05:35.939 --> 00:05:40.259
 I could do that to small children 

00:05:37.889 --> 00:05:44.430
 Imagine that something like this 

00:05:40.259 --> 00:05:46.589
 Reminder of the youth time where you 

00:05:44.430 --> 00:05:48.749
 so mischievously run after now 

00:05:46.589 --> 00:05:49.860
 the new thing is here in this culture 

00:05:48.749 --> 00:05:51.539
 actually that the superhuman 

00:05:49.860 --> 00:05:53.819
 possess powers that I know so it 

00:05:51.539 --> 00:05:57.119
 not yet I knew supernatural 

00:05:53.819 --> 00:05:59.729
 forces so you can fulfill wishes 

00:05:57.119 --> 00:06:00.990
 or you are sitting on a pot of gold 

00:05:59.729 --> 00:06:02.939
 or whatever in the 

00:06:00.990 --> 00:06:03.870
 direction but supernatural powers 

00:06:02.939 --> 00:06:07.069
 all superman 

00:06:03.870 --> 00:06:10.169
 that's actually very interesting 

00:06:07.069 --> 00:06:11.129
 then I would say is here too 

00:06:10.169 --> 00:06:12.870
 have only two films this time 

00:06:11.129 --> 00:06:14.639
 is unlocked here too 

00:06:12.870 --> 00:06:17.719
 conclusion and see you in the 

00:06:14.639 --> 00:06:17.719
 next follow until then
