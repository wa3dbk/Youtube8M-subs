00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.570
 ahead as promised Julian is with us 

00:00:01.740 --> 00:00:08.700
 at 32 16 hi Julian is not it 

00:00:03.570 --> 00:00:10.410
 possible I feel a little missed then 

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:12.210
 Julian all wanted by the polo yes 

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:13.830
 exactly so I'm going to ask a 

00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:14.460
 question to paulo on a plus or minus 

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:15.960
 have formalized 

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:17.940
 we actually got excited last year 

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:19.830
 on the 100% German league final 

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:21.330
 champions and then we still 

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:23.400
 inflamed actually on the fact that they 

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:25.949
 go to 4 top out of 4 in hen 

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:27.359
 this year and there I see that after my 

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:29.490
 findings is that to have 

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:31.050
 as the only survivor so say so 

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:33.120
 that leverkusen is already fucked 

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:34.680
 when i see dortmund had not asked 

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:37.710
 kill me the current form of borussia 

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:40.950
 I fear for them and the cottage that 

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:44.129
 confirms that all commit suicide 

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:49.140
 it's a drama that julien c according to a 

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:50.460
 big that I heard as bullshit 

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:52.170
 on German football since paris has 

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:53.340
 beaten leverkusen it's not possible that 

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:54.480
 so what's this fucking man is 

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:58.949
 overpriced that's your question 

00:00:54.480 --> 00:01:03.329
 not just finish the julien question 

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:04.890
 is not true said Julian the 

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:06.000
 hard bundesliga at the level of 

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:07.619
 performance when as a subscriber 

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:13.619
 Girondins in terms of show I you 

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:15.030
 reassures the kills overestimate beating you 

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:16.770
 realize that that's fine 

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:18.540
 last year the seven clubs 

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:20.130
 Germans engaged in European Cups 

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:22.229
 europa league as champions league 

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:23.670
 have all gone through the phase 

00:01:22.229 --> 00:01:24.960
 of direct elimination so I think that 

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:26.490
 many countries would like to have that 

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:28.470
 this season is the first time 

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:29.729
 that there are four German clubs in league 

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:31.170
 champions the cases are found in 

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:32.579
 round of 16 I think there is a lot 

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:35.990
 tickets already a great performance 

00:01:32.579 --> 00:01:35.990
 that's all in all if 

00:01:37.539 --> 00:01:44.149
 the gap between a gap between them by 

00:01:42.049 --> 00:01:45.740
 example dortmund and the bayern and the 

00:01:44.149 --> 00:01:45.979
 rest of the German clubs yes I the 

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:47.899
 thought 

00:01:45.979 --> 00:01:49.250
 you say that gold that we risk only in 

00:01:47.899 --> 00:01:51.649
 snow may jump to zenith okay 

00:01:49.250 --> 00:01:52.670
 and we'll see that young people put 

00:01:51.649 --> 00:01:54.530
 agree with maybe months 

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:57.380
 I would like just what team in europe 

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:59.270
 little on a whole season deprive oneself of 

00:01:57.380 --> 00:02:01.399
 almost half or more of the 

00:01:59.270 --> 00:02:03.349
 half of his staff type no but you 

00:02:01.399 --> 00:02:04.670
 do not talk about dortmund the wii but I 

00:02:03.349 --> 00:02:07.069
 think Julian's question was 

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:10.099
 further below bayern and dortmund 

00:02:07.069 --> 00:02:12.769
 on the average level of sam sludge and 

00:02:10.099 --> 00:02:13.940
 that's the question the question the 

00:02:12.769 --> 00:02:16.459
 question and does not make sense the question 

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:17.900
 there are four clubs in the 8th finals 

00:02:16.459 --> 00:02:19.610
 guys who all pass in europa league 

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:21.920
 right now there is this will in 

00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:24.019
 France to hang on to something 

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:25.730
 to say we are not so bad but if 

00:02:24.019 --> 00:02:28.579
 tenuous the look of the results of the clubs 

00:02:25.730 --> 00:02:30.560
 and it is urgent to see the bordeaux intra 

00:02:28.579 --> 00:02:33.109
 francfort I reassure you I am found 

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:34.790
 null and well that's why he 

00:02:33.109 --> 00:02:38.450
 must try to hang on like that 

00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:38.989
 but liked to ask a question which are me 

00:02:38.450 --> 00:02:41.150
 important 

00:02:38.989 --> 00:02:42.290
 you want you would be right my opinion 

00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:44.030
 on the problem of the europa league it is 

00:02:42.290 --> 00:02:45.349
 to say that today the real clubs 

00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:46.670
 Germans who should be the europa 

00:02:45.349 --> 00:02:48.260
 league are not there it's on the stock market and 

00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:49.370
 bremen and stuttgart which are clubs in 

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:51.620
 plus 100 million euros this figure the 

00:02:49.370 --> 00:02:53.660
 madness no but it's real problems 

00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:55.280
 that is, these clubs should 

00:02:53.660 --> 00:02:56.359
 in europa league and should make 

00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:57.440
 poles and globally in europe was going 

00:02:56.359 --> 00:02:58.700
 should go much further if 

00:02:57.440 --> 00:03:00.139
 these three clubs there should be there and at 

00:02:58.700 --> 00:03:01.190
 their level that's a truth 

00:03:00.139 --> 00:03:03.079
 now I will give you an example 

00:03:01.190 --> 00:03:04.069
 the bayer leverkusen which replaces it with 

00:03:03.079 --> 00:03:07.760
 the Olympique de marseille the olympic 

00:03:04.069 --> 00:03:09.139
 lyon two years ago leverkusen sort 

00:03:07.760 --> 00:03:10.700
 of a spell of a group where there is this one 

00:03:09.139 --> 00:03:10.970
 and valence in the same group this 

00:03:10.700 --> 00:03:13.160
 year 

00:03:10.970 --> 00:03:14.690
 there is manchester united la real sociedad 

00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:16.730
 and 

00:03:14.690 --> 00:03:18.710
 I forget a shakhtar donesk if it were 

00:03:16.730 --> 00:03:20.780
 two French clubs lyon and marseille 

00:03:18.710 --> 00:03:22.550
 you would all be inclined to the media 

00:03:20.780 --> 00:03:23.720
 French you are an all about 

00:03:22.550 --> 00:03:25.040
 korea colao 

00:03:23.720 --> 00:03:27.680
 in ten years we are the best in the world 

00:03:25.040 --> 00:03:30.080
 ah but after we can not too strong it 

00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:31.700
 is true that it broke out two years ago 

00:03:30.080 --> 00:03:33.260
 by the barca to be carried out not farms 

00:03:31.700 --> 00:03:35.150
 manchester in matters the 

00:03:33.260 --> 00:03:36.680
 returns broke out in eighths I 

00:03:35.150 --> 00:03:38.210
 find that sorry little staff 

00:03:36.680 --> 00:03:39.860
 because it's not normal that it happens 

00:03:38.210 --> 00:03:41.930
 to leverkusen like that systematically 

00:03:39.860 --> 00:03:43.250
 and who expect important to know 

00:03:41.930 --> 00:03:45.860
 it's seeing how the German media 

00:03:43.250 --> 00:03:47.540
 defend leverkusen from fractures because 

00:03:45.860 --> 00:03:48.440
 that they do not want this club to stay 

00:03:47.540 --> 00:03:49.400
 in bundesliga 

00:03:48.440 --> 00:03:50.780
 so now we can always 

00:03:49.400 --> 00:03:52.880
 hang on saying ah yeah you're nothing 

00:03:50.780 --> 00:03:53.960
 to say that she budget paulo to day 

00:03:52.880 --> 00:03:56.450
 so it depends because they are helped 

00:03:53.960 --> 00:03:57.890
 by the by the group bayard in big 

00:03:56.450 --> 00:03:59.660
 for good years it's a little more 

00:03:57.890 --> 00:04:01.340
 of 100 million but if you want on the 

00:03:59.660 --> 00:04:03.140
 100 million there are 25 million that are 

00:04:01.340 --> 00:04:05.600
 systematically given each year by 

00:04:03.140 --> 00:04:06.080
 the big mod is like lyon and 

00:04:05.600 --> 00:04:08.510
 marseille 

00:04:06.080 --> 00:04:09.890
 if it does not get hit in eighth of 

00:04:08.510 --> 00:04:13.130
 champions league final both 

00:04:09.890 --> 00:04:14.410
 others not even in dream t he 

00:04:13.130 --> 00:04:17.480
 I make a little joke at the 

00:04:14.410 --> 00:04:18.620
 design overestimate we would like to create 

00:04:17.480 --> 00:04:20.420
 an international division of labor 

00:04:18.620 --> 00:04:22.370
 of European football we would not do better 

00:04:20.420 --> 00:04:23.960
 that at this moment paris breaks out leverkusen 

00:04:22.370 --> 00:04:26.360
 who arrives bed and the real sociedad 

00:04:23.960 --> 00:04:27.530
 Real Sociedad broke Lyon 1 pump 

00:04:26.360 --> 00:04:27.890
 and to oman in the world of work that 

00:04:27.530 --> 00:04:29.450
 do what 

00:04:27.890 --> 00:04:31.490
 it's an international division of 

00:04:29.450 --> 00:04:32.630
 work so you have to go 

00:04:31.490 --> 00:04:35.480
 count of all that is a lot more 

00:04:32.630 --> 00:04:42.620
 complex what happens ok I 

00:04:35.480 --> 00:04:46.250
 finished too thanks julien went to 32 

00:04:42.620 --> 00:04:47.600
 16 and happy I am well he holds 

00:04:46.250 --> 00:04:50.360
 always his members a little question 

00:04:47.600 --> 00:04:53.060
 in the big one had jumped to the throat and 

00:04:50.360 --> 00:04:55.520
 the medal but in a week daniel 

00:04:53.060 --> 00:04:59.030
 kept everything in him and the sprouted radish 

00:04:55.520 --> 00:05:00.380
 but on libya put 4 and the guys 

00:04:59.030 --> 00:05:03.490
 what the Germans are all cans 

00:05:00.380 --> 00:05:05.690
 but was it if you are sick or what 

00:05:03.490 --> 00:05:07.550
 colossal means and was built 

00:05:05.690 --> 00:05:09.530
 a fabulous deaf team be in 

00:05:07.550 --> 00:05:10.970
 quarter-finals minimum imed 4 0 

00:05:09.530 --> 00:05:12.560
 leverkusen is then in what years but in 

00:05:10.970 --> 00:05:18.920
 what does it mean for German football but 

00:05:12.560 --> 00:05:19.970
 search but wait I'll tell you that I 

00:05:18.920 --> 00:05:22.720
 can say when Spain if there is 

00:05:19.970 --> 00:05:25.370
 a club that nobody wants to meet 

00:05:22.720 --> 00:05:26.510
 of course that I can assure you we say that 

00:05:25.370 --> 00:05:28.400
 on which you want that you want and you're in 

00:05:26.510 --> 00:05:29.690
 Cadors today is the psg and 

00:05:28.400 --> 00:05:34.310
 I know I 'm not a fan of psg 

00:05:29.690 --> 00:05:36.200
 yeah yes it's really but I know 

00:05:34.310 --> 00:05:37.910
 that I say it will go but security 

00:05:36.200 --> 00:05:41.470
 good he would have people ali and tico 

00:05:37.910 --> 00:05:41.470
 want to come across the psg in is that
