00:04:29.590 --> 00:04:29.600 
make sure it's lighting because

00:04:29.600 --> 00:04:35.820

00:05:40.520 --> 00:05:42.370 
have them so that there's nothing so if
you<00:05:40.639> store<00:05:40.940> them<00:05:41.000> vertically<00:05:41.360> they<00:05:41.990> drop<00:05:42.229> down

00:05:42.370 --> 00:05:42.380 
you store them vertically they drop down

00:05:42.380 --> 00:05:47.830 
you store them vertically they drop down
into<00:05:42.560> a<00:05:42.680> case<00:05:42.919> you<00:05:43.220> know<00:05:45.220> just<00:05:46.840> slightly

00:05:47.830 --> 00:05:47.840 
into a case you know just slightly

00:05:47.840 --> 00:05:49.420 
into a case you know just slightly
tighten<00:05:48.169> up<00:05:48.350> I<00:05:48.470> won't<00:05:48.650> go<00:05:48.800> crazy<00:05:49.070> with<00:05:49.310> new

00:05:49.420 --> 00:05:49.430 
tighten up I won't go crazy with new

00:05:49.430 --> 00:05:51.640 
tighten up I won't go crazy with new
because<00:05:49.760> they're<00:05:50.510> to<00:05:50.690> lose<00:05:50.900> your<00:05:51.289> level<00:05:51.590> of
