00:00:10.820 --> 00:00:15.960
 here sat by and do what you think 

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:20.640
 thought up of course I decided to please you 

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:22.680
 another anime review we all 

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:30.060
 ever played and heard about the game 

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:31.770
 visual novels you imagine that 

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:33.270
 you and in life have to do similar 

00:00:31.770 --> 00:00:34.680
 a choice you can't refuse and 

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:36.780
 which are pronounced in your head 

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:39.570
 In an incomprehensible voice and in the most unfortunate 

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:41.610
 for you the situation is not easy 

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:42.510
 whether to eat a sandwich for breakfast 

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:45.239
 with cheese or curry 

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:47.579
 but something like go to school naked or 

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:52.320
 run around the school two circles naked 

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:53.730
 for you to choose in these situations 

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:54.300
 overall I will not torment you and go right away 

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:56.399
 to business 

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:57.769
 new anime curse multi pick 

00:00:56.399 --> 00:01:01.230
 turned my life into hell 

00:00:57.769 --> 00:01:02.760
 will tell us just such a story 17 

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:04.530
 years not Canada amacusa is the second year 

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:06.360
 hears a strange voice that gives him 

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:09.690
 a couple of choices of which amacusa 

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:11.490
 should choose one not subordination whether 

00:01:09.690 --> 00:01:13.260
 failure lead to unbearable pain so 

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:14.970
 that our hero has long come to terms with this 

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:15.950
 problem and trying to choose the most 

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:19.880
 normal 

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:20.390
 mt but of course nothing ever goes 

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:22.009
 according to plan 

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:25.159
 i am a que se increasingly come across 

00:01:22.009 --> 00:01:26.780
 crazy options due to the fact that our 

00:01:25.159 --> 00:01:28.250
 the hero cannot tell anyone about 

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:30.530
 this phenomenon at school began to be considered 

00:01:28.250 --> 00:01:32.299
 freak and thanks to his practically 

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:37.069
 daily frills, he hit the top five 

00:01:32.299 --> 00:01:39.079
 geeks school and only 2 classmates 

00:01:37.069 --> 00:01:48.229
 okay four she considers amakusa her 

00:01:39.079 --> 00:01:49.939
 friend and real man in general, our 

00:01:48.229 --> 00:01:52.009
 the hero would have taken off for a long time 

00:01:49.939 --> 00:01:54.140
 antics if not less than king essence 

00:01:52.009 --> 00:01:56.119
 traction pull that pulls everyones 

00:01:54.140 --> 00:02:00.799
 alterations though sometimes a little 

00:01:56.119 --> 00:02:02.689
 painful ways but like this 

00:02:00.799 --> 00:02:05.869
 it happens that even willpower is not enough 

00:02:02.689 --> 00:02:09.049
 and then you interfere in the matter somehow 

00:02:05.869 --> 00:02:12.610
 thought well of course god which by the way 

00:02:09.049 --> 00:02:15.530
 communicates with our hero on a mobile phone 

00:02:12.610 --> 00:02:17.390
 well, to begin with, the Almighty sends us a 

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:19.549
 course helper pysogogruduyu blonde 

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:22.549
 sweet tooth that got from canada 

00:02:19.549 --> 00:02:25.130
 the name chocolate is evident mismatch 

00:02:22.549 --> 00:02:27.120
 for the name of the protagonist amacusa means 

00:02:25.130 --> 00:02:29.760
 sweet grass 

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:31.560
 and god talk about marcus that he 

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:33.120
 need to perform certain tasks 

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:36.959
 who will come to him on the mobile 

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:38.370
 to get rid of your curse in 

00:02:36.959 --> 00:02:40.200
 In general, we will see a lot 

00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:40.739
 funny cases of incidental situations 

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:42.870
 other things 

00:02:40.739 --> 00:02:45.480
 at the time of this writing came out 

00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:48.150
 only 5 episodes and 12 of them promise us all 

00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:50.790
 and you know what else is interesting and you know what 

00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:52.680
 still interesting that the studio diomede that 

00:02:50.790 --> 00:02:54.920
 has been releasing this by them already 

00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:56.310
 announced both episodes which will be released in 

00:02:54.920 --> 00:02:58.620
 2014 

00:02:56.310 --> 00:03:00.840
 personally, according to my evaluation criteria, I 

00:02:58.620 --> 00:03:02.579
 put this anime solid 8 out of 10 

00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:03.470
 points in the voice anchor we hope they 

00:03:02.579 --> 00:03:06.120
 must possess 

00:03:03.470 --> 00:03:07.950
 I recommend it to view all but from 

00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:09.180
 the microphone spoke a couple of 77 all lucky 

00:03:07.950 --> 00:03:11.930
 day and enjoy 

00:03:09.180 --> 00:03:11.930
 hear more 

00:03:29.580 --> 00:03:31.640
 not
