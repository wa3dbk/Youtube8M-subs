like to match the theme of the reception

00:01:41.939 --> 00:01:44.210 
like to match the theme of the reception
we<00:01:42.090> can<00:01:42.240> certainly<00:01:42.450> match<00:01:42.810> that<00:01:43.140> Natalie<00:01:44.070> how

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:44.220 
we can certainly match that Natalie how

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:45.889 
we can certainly match that Natalie how
does<00:01:44.340> one<00:01:44.490> control<00:01:44.880> the<00:01:45.000> LEDs<00:01:45.329> then<00:01:45.600> that<00:01:45.780> are

00:01:45.889 --> 00:01:45.899 
does one control the LEDs then that are

00:01:45.899 --> 00:01:48.410 
does one control the LEDs then that are

right<00:02:04.740> now<00:02:04.860> we<00:02:04.920> have<00:02:05.159> all<00:02:05.310> the<00:02:05.460> big<00:02:05.640> convention

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:06.210 
right now we have all the big convention

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:08.300 
right now we have all the big convention
lights<00:02:06.360> on<00:02:06.540> and<00:02:06.719> those<00:02:07.229> pictures<00:02:07.500> really<00:02:07.950> show

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:08.310 
lights on and those pictures really show

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:10.700 
lights on and those pictures really show
these<00:02:08.610> LEDs<00:02:09.000> making<00:02:09.599> a<00:02:09.690> glow

00:02:10.700 --> 00:02:10.710 
these LEDs making a glow

00:02:10.710 --> 00:02:13.390 
these LEDs making a glow
yes<00:02:10.860> that<00:02:11.100> is<00:02:11.220> correct<00:02:11.400> the<00:02:12.180> LEDs<00:02:12.990> are

00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:13.400 
yes that is correct the LEDs are

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:15.830 
yes that is correct the LEDs are
extremely<00:02:14.400> powerful<00:02:14.580> they<00:02:15.090> will<00:02:15.270> travel<00:02:15.510> from

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:15.840 
extremely powerful they will travel from

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:17.660 
extremely powerful they will travel from
the<00:02:16.020> bottom<00:02:16.350> all<00:02:16.560> the<00:02:16.620> way<00:02:16.830> to<00:02:16.920> the<00:02:17.100> top<00:02:17.340> and

00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:17.670 
the bottom all the way to the top and

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:19.700 
the bottom all the way to the top and
around<00:02:18.030> the<00:02:18.360> enclosure<00:02:18.540> to<00:02:18.930> illuminate<00:02:19.560> the

00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:19.710 
around the enclosure to illuminate the

around the enclosure to illuminate the
whole<00:02:19.860> cube<00:02:20.160> knitly<00:02:20.790> you<00:02:20.880> mentioned<00:02:21.210> that

00:02:21.710 --> 00:02:21.720 
whole cube knitly you mentioned that

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:23.600 
whole cube knitly you mentioned that
this<00:02:21.990> has<00:02:22.200> privacy<00:02:22.680> doors<00:02:23.040> that<00:02:23.190> can<00:02:23.340> be<00:02:23.430> used

00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:23.610 
this has privacy doors that can be used

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:25.490 
this has privacy doors that can be used
and<00:02:24.000> right<00:02:24.270> now<00:02:24.390> of<00:02:24.450> course<00:02:24.510> it's<00:02:24.780> up<00:02:24.930> so<00:02:25.110> how

00:02:25.490 --> 00:02:25.500 
and right now of course it's up so how

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:27.350 
and right now of course it's up so how
does<00:02:25.560> a<00:02:25.680> person<00:02:25.860> lower<00:02:26.460> this<00:02:26.670> and<00:02:26.940> how<00:02:27.180> does<00:02:27.240> it

00:02:27.350 --> 00:02:27.360 
does a person lower this and how does it

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:31.160 
does a person lower this and how does it
all<00:02:27.450> work<00:02:27.650> so<00:02:28.650> these<00:02:29.190> two<00:02:29.490> straps<00:02:29.880> can<00:02:30.750> be<00:02:30.930> take

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:31.170 
all work so these two straps can be take

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:36.710 
all work so these two straps can be take
can<00:02:31.620> be<00:02:31.800> taken<00:02:32.400> down<00:02:34.640> once<00:02:35.640> those<00:02:35.910> once<00:02:36.480> those

00:02:36.710 --> 00:02:36.720 
can be taken down once those once those

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:40.670 
can be taken down once those once those
are<00:02:36.930> off<00:02:37.050> it<00:02:37.530> rolls<00:02:37.860> down<00:02:38.040> and<00:02:39.320> they<00:02:40.320> can<00:02:40.530> be

00:02:40.670 --> 00:02:40.680 
are off it rolls down and they can be

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:42.260 
are off it rolls down and they can be
zipped<00:02:40.950> from<00:02:41.220> top<00:02:41.430> all<00:02:41.670> the<00:02:42.000> way<00:02:42.090> to<00:02:42.150> the

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:42.270 
zipped from top all the way to the

00:02:42.270 --> 00:02:48.230 
zipped from top all the way to the
bottom<00:02:46.340> so<00:02:47.340> once<00:02:47.490> it<00:02:47.610> zipped<00:02:47.820> if<00:02:47.970> I'm<00:02:48.090> using

00:02:48.230 --> 00:02:48.240 
bottom so once it zipped if I'm using

00:02:48.240 --> 00:02:49.640 
bottom so once it zipped if I'm using
this<00:02:48.450> at<00:02:48.630> a<00:02:48.660> high<00:02:48.810> school<00:02:49.020> dance<00:02:49.200> I<00:02:49.410> don't<00:02:49.560> have

00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:49.650 
this at a high school dance I don't have

00:02:49.650 --> 00:02:50.660 
this at a high school dance I don't have
to<00:02:49.740> worry<00:02:49.860> about<00:02:49.950> the<00:02:50.100> kids<00:02:50.310> getting<00:02:50.610> out

00:02:50.660 --> 00:02:50.670 
to worry about the kids getting out

00:02:50.670 --> 00:02:52.040 
to worry about the kids getting out
without<00:02:50.850> me<00:02:51.120> at<00:02:51.270> least<00:02:51.420> hearing<00:02:51.630> a<00:02:51.750> zipper<00:02:52.020> or

00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:52.050 
without me at least hearing a zipper or

00:02:52.050 --> 00:02:54.350 
without me at least hearing a zipper or
something<00:02:52.500> correct<00:02:53.190> that<00:02:53.760> is<00:02:53.940> a<00:02:53.970> really<00:02:54.240> nice

00:02:54.350 --> 00:02:54.360 
something correct that is a really nice

00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:56.150 
something correct that is a really nice
feature<00:02:54.660> so<00:02:55.020> with<00:02:55.410> the<00:02:55.530> poor<00:02:55.740> is<00:02:55.860> it<00:02:55.980> for

00:02:56.150 --> 00:02:56.160 
feature so with the poor is it for

00:02:56.160 --> 00:02:57.740 
feature so with the poor is it for
doorways<00:02:56.730> like<00:02:56.910> this<00:02:57.060> it<00:02:57.270> really<00:02:57.390> gives<00:02:57.630> you<00:02:57.690> a

00:02:57.740 --> 00:02:57.750 
doorways like this it really gives you a

00:02:57.750 --> 00:02:59.240 
doorways like this it really gives you a
lot<00:02:57.780> of<00:02:57.900> flexibility<00:02:58.470> on<00:02:58.560> how<00:02:58.800> you<00:02:58.860> set<00:02:59.070> this

00:02:59.240 --> 00:02:59.250 
lot of flexibility on how you set this

00:02:59.250 --> 00:03:01.070 
lot of flexibility on how you set this
up<00:02:59.430> all<00:02:59.730> four<00:03:00.210> doors<00:03:00.360> are<00:03:00.600> exactly<00:03:00.900> the<00:03:01.050> same

00:03:01.070 --> 00:03:01.080 
up all four doors are exactly the same

00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:03.110 
up all four doors are exactly the same
so<00:03:01.440> really<00:03:01.710> any<00:03:01.950> door<00:03:02.250> can<00:03:02.430> be<00:03:02.460> the<00:03:02.850> entry

00:03:03.110 --> 00:03:03.120 
so really any door can be the entry

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:05.090 
so really any door can be the entry
point<00:03:03.390> which<00:03:03.870> of<00:03:04.050> course<00:03:04.230> for<00:03:04.410> setting<00:03:04.740> up<00:03:04.860> in

00:03:05.090 --> 00:03:05.100 
point which of course for setting up in

00:03:05.100 --> 00:03:07.220 
point which of course for setting up in
a<00:03:05.220> small<00:03:05.550> confined<00:03:06.000> area<00:03:06.240> where<00:03:06.780> I<00:03:06.810> maybe<00:03:07.020> not

00:03:07.220 --> 00:03:07.230 
a small confined area where I maybe not

00:03:07.230 --> 00:03:08.480 
a small confined area where I maybe not
be<00:03:07.320> able<00:03:07.410> to<00:03:07.530> turn<00:03:07.680> it<00:03:07.800> around<00:03:07.830> back<00:03:08.250> and<00:03:08.280> forth

00:03:08.480 --> 00:03:08.490 
be able to turn it around back and forth

00:03:08.490 --> 00:03:12.020 
be able to turn it around back and forth
it's<00:03:09.120> really<00:03:09.630> a<00:03:09.660> big<00:03:10.020> advantage<00:03:10.290> yes<00:03:11.010> now<00:03:11.850> what

00:03:12.020 --> 00:03:12.030 
it's really a big advantage yes now what

00:03:12.030 --> 00:03:13.490 
it's really a big advantage yes now what
size<00:03:12.300> are<00:03:12.510> we<00:03:12.570> talking<00:03:12.930> about<00:03:12.990> now<00:03:13.230> as<00:03:13.380> we're

00:03:13.490 --> 00:03:13.500 
size are we talking about now as we're

00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:14.960 
size are we talking about now as we're
looking<00:03:13.590> at<00:03:13.800> this<00:03:13.890> because<00:03:14.100> this<00:03:14.220> is<00:03:14.280> this<00:03:14.820> is

00:03:14.960 --> 00:03:14.970 
looking at this because this is this is

00:03:14.970 --> 00:03:17.510 
looking at this because this is this is
pretty<00:03:15.150> good<00:03:15.300> size<00:03:15.650> it's<00:03:16.650> 8<00:03:16.890> feet<00:03:17.160> all<00:03:17.310> the<00:03:17.430> way

00:03:17.510 --> 00:03:17.520 
pretty good size it's 8 feet all the way

00:03:17.520 --> 00:03:19.400 
pretty good size it's 8 feet all the way
around<00:03:17.820> now<00:03:18.090> is<00:03:18.750> there<00:03:18.900> anything<00:03:19.050> we<00:03:19.200> need<00:03:19.230> to

00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:19.410 
around now is there anything we need to

00:03:19.410 --> 00:03:21.470 
around now is there anything we need to
do<00:03:19.500> special<00:03:19.800> on<00:03:20.100> the<00:03:20.340> ground<00:03:20.640> before<00:03:21.030> setting

Natalie<00:04:56.590> I<00:04:56.740> really<00:04:56.800> like<00:04:57.160> this<00:04:57.340> look<00:04:57.520> this<00:04:57.640> is

00:04:57.810 --> 00:04:57.820 
Natalie I really like this look this is

00:04:57.820 --> 00:05:00.150 
Natalie I really like this look this is
just<00:04:57.970> such<00:04:58.120> a<00:04:58.150> clean<00:04:58.630> pretty<00:04:59.050> look<00:04:59.290> it<00:04:59.650> takes

00:05:00.150 --> 00:05:00.160 
just such a clean pretty look it takes

00:05:00.160 --> 00:05:01.560 
just such a clean pretty look it takes
up<00:05:00.280> a<00:05:00.370> little<00:05:00.460> bit<00:05:00.640> of<00:05:00.730> space<00:05:00.880> how<00:05:01.090> big<00:05:01.270> is<00:05:01.419> this

00:05:01.560 --> 00:05:01.570 
up a little bit of space how big is this

00:05:01.570 --> 00:05:03.990 
up a little bit of space how big is this
it's<00:05:02.140> ten<00:05:02.380> and<00:05:02.530> a<00:05:02.560> half<00:05:02.710> feet<00:05:02.770> but<00:05:03.520> it<00:05:03.610> takes<00:05:03.790> up

00:05:03.990 --> 00:05:04.000 
it's ten and a half feet but it takes up

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:05.580 
it's ten and a half feet but it takes up
approximately<00:05:04.720> eight<00:05:04.960> feet<00:05:05.200> of<00:05:05.320> space

00:05:05.580 --> 00:05:05.590 
approximately eight feet of space

00:05:05.590 --> 00:05:07.500 
approximately eight feet of space
because<00:05:05.890> of<00:05:06.070> the<00:05:06.190> natural<00:05:06.760> curvature<00:05:07.030> of<00:05:07.270> the

00:05:07.500 --> 00:05:07.510 
because of the natural curvature of the

00:05:07.510 --> 00:05:09.300 
because of the natural curvature of the
wall<00:05:07.690> so<00:05:08.110> in<00:05:08.290> some<00:05:08.410> situations<00:05:08.919> we<00:05:09.040> may<00:05:09.160> not

00:05:09.300 --> 00:05:09.310 
wall so in some situations we may not

00:05:09.310 --> 00:05:10.800 
wall so in some situations we may not
have<00:05:09.610> you<00:05:09.970> know<00:05:10.000> that<00:05:10.210> wide<00:05:10.360> open<00:05:10.540> area<00:05:10.720> is

00:05:10.800 --> 00:05:10.810 
have you know that wide open area is

00:05:10.810 --> 00:05:12.150 
have you know that wide open area is
this<00:05:10.930> a<00:05:10.990> little<00:05:11.260> flexible<00:05:11.620> for<00:05:11.830> maybe<00:05:11.950> it's<00:05:12.130> a

00:05:12.150 --> 00:05:12.160 
this a little flexible for maybe it's a

00:05:12.160 --> 00:05:14.190

little<00:05:12.340> bit<00:05:12.430> smaller<00:05:12.640> area<00:05:12.940> yes<00:05:13.660> it<00:05:13.870> is<00:05:13.990> it's

00:05:14.190 --> 00:05:14.200 
little bit smaller area yes it is it's

00:05:14.200 --> 00:05:16.080

feet<00:05:21.460> I'm<00:05:22.060> looking<00:05:22.390> at<00:05:22.510> the<00:05:22.750> bottom<00:05:23.350> now<00:05:23.440> we

00:05:23.760 --> 00:05:23.770 
feet I'm looking at the bottom now we

00:05:23.770 --> 00:05:24.930 
feet I'm looking at the bottom now we
must<00:05:23.919> have<00:05:24.010> the<00:05:24.130> same<00:05:24.250> led<00:05:24.669> kind<00:05:24.880> of

00:05:24.930 --> 00:05:24.940 
must have the same led kind of

00:05:24.940 --> 00:05:26.250 
must have the same led kind of
configuration<00:05:25.300> as<00:05:25.600> we<00:05:25.750> did<00:05:25.960> with<00:05:26.110> the

00:05:26.250 --> 00:05:26.260 
configuration as we did with the

00:05:26.260 --> 00:05:28.020 
configuration as we did with the
enclosure<00:05:26.620> is<00:05:26.800> that<00:05:26.919> correct<00:05:27.160> yes<00:05:27.610> it<00:05:27.669> is<00:05:27.910> the

00:05:28.020 --> 00:05:28.030 
enclosure is that correct yes it is the

00:05:28.030 --> 00:05:29.970 
enclosure is that correct yes it is the
same<00:05:28.240> technology<00:05:28.600> with<00:05:29.230> the<00:05:29.320> exception<00:05:29.830> of

00:05:29.970 --> 00:05:29.980 
same technology with the exception of

00:05:29.980 --> 00:05:32.460 
same technology with the exception of
the<00:05:30.370> privacy<00:05:30.820> factor<00:05:31.300> so<00:05:31.900> with<00:05:32.020> the<00:05:32.080> enclosure

00:05:32.460 --> 00:05:32.470 
the privacy factor so with the enclosure

00:05:32.470 --> 00:05:33.810 
the privacy factor so with the enclosure
we<00:05:32.620> can<00:05:32.800> kind<00:05:32.980> of<00:05:33.010> control<00:05:33.160> things<00:05:33.669> a<00:05:33.730> little

00:05:33.810 --> 00:05:33.820 
we can kind of control things a little

00:05:33.820 --> 00:05:34.920 
we can kind of control things a little
bit<00:05:34.000> now<00:05:34.120> can<00:05:34.300> we<00:05:34.360> do<00:05:34.450> the<00:05:34.540> same<00:05:34.690> thing<00:05:34.840> with

00:05:34.920 --> 00:05:34.930 
bit now can we do the same thing with

00:05:34.930 --> 00:05:36.810 
bit now can we do the same thing with
the<00:05:35.020> wall<00:05:35.169> yes<00:05:35.950> you<00:05:36.160> can<00:05:36.310> do<00:05:36.370> the<00:05:36.490> same<00:05:36.669> thing

00:05:36.810 --> 00:05:36.820 
the wall yes you can do the same thing

00:05:36.820 --> 00:05:37.980 
the wall yes you can do the same thing
with<00:05:36.940> the<00:05:37.030> wall<00:05:37.210> there's<00:05:37.480> sixteen<00:05:37.870> different

also incorporated into the structure yes
it<00:06:13.330> is<00:06:13.449> also<00:06:13.629> embedded<00:06:14.050> in<00:06:14.289> the<00:06:14.469> structure<00:06:14.740> so

00:06:15.149 --> 00:06:15.159 
it is also embedded in the structure so

00:06:15.159 --> 00:06:16.439 
it is also embedded in the structure so
we<00:06:15.249> were<00:06:15.340> looking<00:06:15.520> at<00:06:15.610> about<00:06:15.669> 30<00:06:16.060> pounds<00:06:16.419> for

00:06:16.439 --> 00:06:16.449 
we were looking at about 30 pounds for

00:06:16.449 --> 00:06:17.700 
we were looking at about 30 pounds for
the<00:06:16.599> enclosure<00:06:16.900> what<00:06:17.139> is<00:06:17.259> the<00:06:17.349> weight<00:06:17.469> on<00:06:17.620> the
