dr.<00:00:00.750> light<00:00:00.930> how's<00:00:01.410> it<00:00:01.589> going<00:00:01.890> will<00:00:02.040> it<00:00:02.159> be<00:00:02.250> okay

00:00:03.370 --> 00:00:03.380 
dr. light how's it going will it be okay

00:00:03.380 --> 00:00:06.530 
dr. light how's it going will it be okay
I'm<00:00:04.380> almost<00:00:04.560> finished<00:00:05.029> the<00:00:06.029> battery<00:00:06.330> be

00:00:06.530 --> 00:00:06.540 
I'm almost finished the battery be

00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:10.100 
I'm almost finished the battery be
charged<00:00:06.899> in<00:00:07.080> ten<00:00:07.319> minutes<00:00:08.389> that's<00:00:09.389> good<00:00:09.690> by

00:00:10.100 --> 00:00:10.110 
charged in ten minutes that's good by

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:14.740 
charged in ten minutes that's good by
the<00:00:10.170> way<00:00:10.290> what<00:00:10.860> do<00:00:10.980> you<00:00:11.070> make<00:00:11.219> of<00:00:11.370> these<00:00:12.380> these

00:00:14.740 --> 00:00:14.750 
the way what do you make of these these

00:00:14.750 --> 00:00:20.900 
the way what do you make of these these
seems<00:00:15.750> to<00:00:15.929> be<00:00:16.049> energy<00:00:16.410> resources<00:00:19.789> but<00:00:20.789> I've

00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:20.910 
seems to be energy resources but I've

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:24.050 
seems to be energy resources but I've
never<00:00:21.240> seen<00:00:21.570> this<00:00:21.779> type<00:00:21.840> on<00:00:22.260> earth<00:00:22.439> I<00:00:23.060> don't

00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:24.060 
never seen this type on earth I don't

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:33.680 
never seen this type on earth I don't
know<00:00:24.150> where<00:00:24.330> this<00:00:24.480> energy<00:00:24.960> came<00:00:25.199> from<00:00:32.540> all<00:00:33.540> the

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:33.690 
know where this energy came from all the

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:36.979 
know where this energy came from all the
energy<00:00:34.079> of<00:00:34.110> eataly<00:00:34.530> mega<00:00:34.950> man<00:00:35.390> but<00:00:36.390> where<00:00:36.660> is

00:00:36.979 --> 00:00:36.989 
energy of eataly mega man but where is

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:40.340 
energy of eataly mega man but where is
dr.<00:00:37.410> wily<00:00:37.620> that's<00:00:38.370> a<00:00:38.520> good<00:00:38.760> question<00:00:39.270> we<00:00:40.170> may

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:40.350 
dr. wily that's a good question we may

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:42.110 
dr. wily that's a good question we may
be<00:00:40.710> able<00:00:40.800> to<00:00:41.100> locate<00:00:41.430> another<00:00:41.640> energy

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:42.120 
be able to locate another energy

emission from the radar room when we
find<00:00:44.940> that<00:00:45.149> media

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:45.690 
find that media

00:00:45.690 --> 00:01:44.600 
find that media
we'll<00:00:46.020> find<00:00:46.379> dr.<00:00:46.860> wowie

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:44.610 

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:57.020 

he<00:01:45.610> still<00:01:46.000> lives

00:02:00.719 --> 00:02:00.729 
what that Megaman you must go after him

what that Megaman you must go after him
we<00:02:01.329> don't<00:02:01.450> know<00:02:01.600> who<00:02:01.750> he<00:02:01.899> is

we don't know who he is

00:02:02.140 --> 00:02:05.969 
we don't know who he is
as<00:02:02.380> dangerous<00:02:03.159> to<00:02:03.219> leave<00:02:03.460> him<00:02:03.670> alone
