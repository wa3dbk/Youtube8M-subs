00:00:04.780 --> 00:00:08.890
 Now I would like more detail 

00:00:07.060 --> 00:00:12.250
 dwell on how you 

00:00:08.890 --> 00:00:14.740
 can find the file you need 

00:00:12.250 --> 00:00:16.930
 how can you more clearly 

00:00:14.740 --> 00:00:19.000
 set the search criteria to 

00:00:16.930 --> 00:00:19.630
 quickly find the information that you 

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:22.120
 interested in 

00:00:19.630 --> 00:00:24.640
 we all know that the name of any 

00:00:22.120 --> 00:00:26.530
 file consists of two parts is the name 

00:00:24.640 --> 00:00:28.750
 file and its extension 

00:00:26.530 --> 00:00:31.360
 if you wish, we can search for files by 

00:00:28.750 --> 00:00:33.640
 expansion for example and we need to find 

00:00:31.360 --> 00:00:36.070
 some digital photo 

00:00:33.640 --> 00:00:39.219
 cameras usually do very little 

00:00:36.070 --> 00:00:41.260
 informative file names and therefore 

00:00:39.219 --> 00:00:43.089
 a photo that was copied from 

00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:45.129
 your digital camera by 

00:00:43.089 --> 00:00:47.109
 the name you probably these are unlikely 

00:00:45.129 --> 00:00:48.879
 it turns out, but we know for example 

00:00:47.109 --> 00:00:51.489
 approximate shooting date and expansion 

00:00:48.879 --> 00:00:53.409
 the file you make you easy enough 

00:00:51.489 --> 00:00:56.170
 find this photo you need 

00:00:53.409 --> 00:01:00.489
 but of course there is one small nuance 

00:00:56.170 --> 00:01:02.260
 so that the photo was searched by date 

00:01:00.489 --> 00:01:04.570
 that is so you can find a photo 

00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:07.210
 It is for let in when this photograph 

00:01:04.570 --> 00:01:08.549
 made necessary in the settings 

00:01:07.210 --> 00:01:11.590
 your camera 

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:13.570
 the correct date was displayed then in 

00:01:11.590 --> 00:01:16.030
 this case for example if you know what 

00:01:13.570 --> 00:01:18.130
 to you right in september 2010 you were 

00:01:16.030 --> 00:01:20.020
 somewhere on vacation at sea and want to find 

00:01:18.130 --> 00:01:22.719
 the photo is from the sea 

00:01:20.020 --> 00:01:24.369
 you can search for example in 

00:01:22.719 --> 00:01:28.090
 program conductor issuing 

00:01:24.369 --> 00:01:31.600
 setting the following as a search criterion 

00:01:28.090 --> 00:01:36.159
 information ie you can in here 

00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:37.390
 first here enter the date of change and 

00:01:36.159 --> 00:01:40.869
 specify here 

00:01:37.390 --> 00:01:43.619
 Well, for example, well, let it be some 1 

00:01:40.869 --> 00:01:48.009
 October 2011 

00:01:43.619 --> 00:01:51.090
 and then we need to ask one more 

00:01:48.009 --> 00:01:54.070
 criterion this will be our file type and 

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:56.140
 now we have to enter the file type here 

00:01:54.070 --> 00:01:59.829
 which we look for their example this will be a file 

00:01:56.140 --> 00:02:03.369
 g also p. 

00:01:59.829 --> 00:02:04.600
 I do not have such files on my computer 

00:02:03.369 --> 00:02:06.729
 well let's just i delete now 

00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:09.640
 search criteria change date and just 

00:02:06.729 --> 00:02:12.220
 look for files by the type you see that 

00:02:09.640 --> 00:02:13.959
 All files are now displayed to me 

00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:15.280
 images that have an extension 

00:02:13.959 --> 00:02:18.760
 jeeps g 

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:20.440
 if you are here, respectively , well, you just 

00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:22.569
 know that you have files on your computer 

00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:26.800
 who are from your vacation ie sea beyond 

00:02:22.569 --> 00:02:28.920
 there october 2011 2010 you here still 

00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:31.390
 install another filter 

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:34.180
 For example, the date of change as I said 

00:02:31.390 --> 00:02:36.720
 and then you will have displayed in in 

00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:40.209
 search results only those files 

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:44.410
 images that were created exactly 

00:02:40.209 --> 00:02:46.510
 in october 2010 now i'm 

00:02:44.410 --> 00:02:48.070
 used the finished filter which 

00:02:46.510 --> 00:02:49.810
 there is a program guide i 

00:02:48.070 --> 00:02:51.760
 used filter type 

00:02:49.810 --> 00:02:54.040
 but you can actually produce 

00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:59.080
 search and as follows you can 

00:02:54.040 --> 00:03:03.970
 Enter the following asterisk combination. 

00:02:59.080 --> 00:03:07.209
 and then lead dpg it will be the same 

00:03:03.970 --> 00:03:09.910
 what to apply filter type and point there 

00:03:07.209 --> 00:03:12.340
 just gpg what is this character 

00:03:09.910 --> 00:03:15.060
 asterisks replace absolutely any 

00:03:12.340 --> 00:03:18.160
 characters before or before 

00:03:15.060 --> 00:03:20.140
 some characters we entered and here 

00:03:18.160 --> 00:03:23.290
 this is the record that we are with you now 

00:03:20.140 --> 00:03:24.670
 introduced means the following that on 

00:03:23.290 --> 00:03:26.890
 computer will be searched 

00:03:24.670 --> 00:03:29.769
 absolutely all files that have 

00:03:26.890 --> 00:03:30.640
 absolutely any name but have an extension 

00:03:29.769 --> 00:03:33.190
 Joe P.G. 

00:03:30.640 --> 00:03:36.340
 in such a way we are very 

00:03:33.190 --> 00:03:38.890
 we can easily find our file above it either 

00:03:36.340 --> 00:03:40.810
 we can for example ask the following we 

00:03:38.890 --> 00:03:44.190
 we can search all files on the computer 

00:03:40.810 --> 00:03:46.930
 which have txt extension 

00:03:44.190 --> 00:03:48.670
 we are now we are not really looking for everything 

00:03:46.930 --> 00:03:51.579
 files on the computer and all the files that 

00:03:48.670 --> 00:03:52.840
 we are in libraries for 

00:03:51.579 --> 00:03:54.489
 to say on the computer 

00:03:52.840 --> 00:03:57.280
 we need here here in the area 

00:03:54.489 --> 00:04:00.220
 transitions choose a computer and then 

00:03:57.280 --> 00:04:02.109
 enter our search query and then have 

00:04:00.220 --> 00:04:04.570
 we are absolutely all the files are displayed 

00:04:02.109 --> 00:04:07.180
 which have txt extension 

00:04:04.570 --> 00:04:09.910
 I can do our request for example, so I 

00:04:07.180 --> 00:04:12.760
 I want to find all the files that have 

00:04:09.910 --> 00:04:14.230
 Called whose name begins on 

00:04:12.760 --> 00:04:17.919
 letter t 

00:04:14.230 --> 00:04:21.160
 and ends for example with a letter on 

00:04:17.919 --> 00:04:23.409
 combined with t that is the text yes you see 

00:04:21.160 --> 00:04:25.539
 I have deduced that these files have 

00:04:23.409 --> 00:04:26.139
 me asterisk in this case 

00:04:25.539 --> 00:04:29.409
 banner 

00:04:26.139 --> 00:04:32.530
 the letters e and to this simple way 

00:04:29.409 --> 00:04:34.659
 you can set a so-called mask 

00:04:32.530 --> 00:04:37.469
 search because here these characters 

00:04:34.659 --> 00:04:39.639
 which are used in search in for 

00:04:37.469 --> 00:04:42.669
 forming search queries 

00:04:39.639 --> 00:04:44.499
 are called mask of these characters 

00:04:42.669 --> 00:04:46.300
 several but probably most often 

00:04:44.499 --> 00:04:48.249
 used is exactly the star symbol 

00:04:46.300 --> 00:04:49.300
 and explicitly recommend using it. 

00:04:48.249 --> 00:04:51.729
 because it is really very 

00:04:49.300 --> 00:04:54.029
 convenient ie returning to our 

00:04:51.729 --> 00:04:55.960
 photos if you want to find 

00:04:54.029 --> 00:04:58.419
 photos on the computer let's 

00:04:55.960 --> 00:04:59.819
 let's spend the whole beginning as to you 

00:04:58.419 --> 00:05:04.090
 would do 

00:04:59.819 --> 00:05:06.189
 start the explorer choose a computer 

00:05:04.090 --> 00:05:09.310
 in order to search all 

00:05:06.189 --> 00:05:11.770
 computer then go to the window 

00:05:09.310 --> 00:05:14.069
 search query and enter here 

00:05:11.770 --> 00:05:18.520
 for example the following search query 

00:05:14.069 --> 00:05:21.310
 asterisk afterwards. 

00:05:18.520 --> 00:05:24.580
 Jeff png is an extension of photos 

00:05:21.310 --> 00:05:27.069
 then we select the change date and here 

00:05:24.580 --> 00:05:29.589
 indicate that date or that date interval 

00:05:27.069 --> 00:05:33.400
 in which your photo was created 

00:05:29.589 --> 00:05:35.289
 for example let's choose a long time let's 

00:05:33.400 --> 00:05:37.509
 choose because i have on my computer 

00:05:35.289 --> 00:05:40.180
 there are photos that were taken 

00:05:37.509 --> 00:05:42.839
 for a long time and now I have chosen 

00:05:40.180 --> 00:05:45.819
 all all photos and either you or all 

00:05:42.839 --> 00:05:48.520
 image that have a joe extension 

00:05:45.819 --> 00:05:50.649
 pg and which is on my computer what 

00:05:48.520 --> 00:05:53.740
 should now be done now I go 

00:05:50.649 --> 00:05:56.500
 here and change for example the display 

00:05:53.740 --> 00:05:59.379
 on large icons now it is very easy for me 

00:05:56.500 --> 00:06:01.839
 just flipping through like this 

00:05:59.379 --> 00:06:04.240
 way all my images find that 

00:06:01.839 --> 00:06:05.889
 a photo that interests me and 

00:06:04.240 --> 00:06:08.909
 accordingly, work already 

00:06:05.889 --> 00:06:08.909
 directly with her
