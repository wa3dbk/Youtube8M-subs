00:00:09.340 --> 00:00:15.949
 so then hello I want 

00:00:12.920 --> 00:00:20.439
 show you how i was doing 

00:00:15.949 --> 00:00:24.259
 engine decapping ga16de 

00:00:20.439 --> 00:00:30.230
 car nissan almera body n 15 

00:00:24.259 --> 00:00:32.329
 99 year mileage is 320 thousand of 

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:35.030
 100 of them I am logical for myself for two s 

00:00:32.329 --> 00:00:38.500
 half a year there may be problems through 

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:42.070
 coiled but it doesn't bother me 

00:00:38.500 --> 00:00:48.340
 we will use as decoder 

00:00:42.070 --> 00:00:48.340
 I did swim because the procedure 

00:00:49.090 --> 00:00:55.940
 nothing complicated here 

00:00:50.870 --> 00:00:58.090
 Thing helps me say the price 390 

00:00:55.940 --> 00:00:58.090
 rubles 

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:05.420
 for this you first need to warm up 

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:08.060
 engine with what is necessary 

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:10.130
 warm up is not just what he worked 

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:16.450
 at least half an hour to warm everything up 

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:19.280
 completely prepare spare candles 

00:01:16.450 --> 00:01:25.430
 flushing oil is not appropriate 

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:30.729
 filter new oil to replace the beginning 

00:01:25.430 --> 00:01:30.729
 We will do the details so 

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:37.810
 in order to start once the ending 

00:01:37.960 --> 00:01:40.440
 need to cook 

00:01:41.540 --> 00:01:44.530
 buy 

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:48.290
 valar sent a letter a 

00:01:48.490 --> 00:01:51.210
 flushing oil 

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:58.399
 replaceable filter is better than 21 cheaper you 

00:01:55.490 --> 00:02:00.909
 the original turbo will go cheaper for 

00:01:58.399 --> 00:02:00.909
 flushing engine 

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:05.990
 but there is still no candle 

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:11.290
 change anyway i will use 

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:16.280
 old candles new i will take off on old year 

00:02:11.290 --> 00:02:18.510
 promo vadim means so for that to us 

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:22.080
 need to 

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:24.120
 first we twist the candles and look for 

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:28.140
 piston position so that they are on 

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:35.120
 one level is done then i take or cable 

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:35.120
 by usual dropping his candle hole and 

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:42.600
 eat you a million by pulley 

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:44.420
 even cranking looking average 

00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:48.410
 tower position 

00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:48.410
 that would rise at the same level 

00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:54.890
 then 

00:02:51.350 --> 00:03:01.240
 the viewer must be hot very well 

00:02:54.890 --> 00:03:01.240
 warmed up to the biggest 

00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:13.510
 the box has a rest bottle 

00:03:11.230 --> 00:03:15.280
 one hundred and 85 grams is enough 

00:03:13.510 --> 00:03:18.540
 it will remain but I pour everything completely 

00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:18.540
 as with the tube 

00:03:24.030 --> 00:03:31.069
 we fill up remember the guy he's here 

00:03:27.709 --> 00:03:33.909
 24 milligrams 

00:03:31.069 --> 00:03:33.909
 we pump 

00:03:37.200 --> 00:03:41.340
 crushing 

00:03:39.150 --> 00:03:43.380
 and right insert the candle hole 

00:03:41.340 --> 00:03:46.460
 tubule 

00:03:43.380 --> 00:03:46.460
 and splash out 

00:03:54.810 --> 00:03:59.560
 careful to 

00:03:56.030 --> 00:03:59.560
 got on gareta because smell 

00:04:05.210 --> 00:04:12.000
 why can hot engine why 

00:04:08.159 --> 00:04:15.400
 the liquid starts to evaporate 

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:17.739
 let us fill the fluid 

00:04:15.400 --> 00:04:20.560
 wrap all cylinders completely 

00:04:17.739 --> 00:04:22.120
 candles old grandfather morning ride to old 

00:04:20.560 --> 00:04:25.150
 before that which can change left 

00:04:22.120 --> 00:04:30.460
 only you bought what was formed there 

00:04:25.150 --> 00:04:34.389
 steam bath and the most it starts 

00:04:30.460 --> 00:04:38.470
 penetrate all corners of the body dad on on 

00:04:34.389 --> 00:04:39.820
 all by nakara happens 

00:04:38.470 --> 00:04:42.700
 soft addition decreases 

00:04:39.820 --> 00:04:45.120
 I go to the gas in my headset 

00:04:42.700 --> 00:04:48.510
 prevention is the only will not hurt 

00:04:45.120 --> 00:04:53.560
 not be worse for sure can be even better 

00:04:48.510 --> 00:04:57.010
 just need to learn sometimes I produced but not 

00:04:53.560 --> 00:05:00.400
 may I already go for it before this groove 

00:04:57.010 --> 00:05:04.410
 approximately show you all these old 

00:05:00.400 --> 00:05:07.120
 spun now doing such movements 

00:05:04.410 --> 00:05:09.070
 or he for a pulley 

00:05:07.120 --> 00:05:11.410
 i love the alternator pulley if i 

00:05:09.070 --> 00:05:13.440
 more comfortable and doing the movement here 

00:05:11.410 --> 00:05:16.000
 small slightly at all 

00:05:13.440 --> 00:05:17.190
 so that the fluid passes between the rings and 

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:21.040
 all piston grooves 

00:05:17.190 --> 00:05:25.660
 back and forth back and forth a little or podel 

00:05:21.040 --> 00:05:30.810
 all and leave at least an hour if you 

00:05:25.660 --> 00:05:32.919
 hurry ender the way 100 hours at 15 

00:05:30.810 --> 00:05:34.960

00:05:32.919 --> 00:05:42.070
 I hurry yes yes yes yes why the day the car so 

00:05:34.960 --> 00:05:45.210
 and leave you it will be important if 

00:05:42.070 --> 00:05:48.580
 your car consumes oil heavily 

00:05:45.210 --> 00:05:49.630
 Turov software does not help and distinguishes 

00:05:48.580 --> 00:05:53.160
 Only one thing you have in your machine weight 

00:05:49.630 --> 00:05:55.500
 lives means fingers 

00:05:53.160 --> 00:06:00.340
 I have a torso like when I bought 

00:05:55.500 --> 00:06:02.350
 oil consumption was just helen1 try 

00:06:00.340 --> 00:06:06.070
 told the pride helped all the rings me 

00:06:02.350 --> 00:06:09.310

00:06:06.070 --> 00:06:11.560
 220,000 sleeves 

00:06:09.310 --> 00:06:13.000
 practically not worn chamfers 

00:06:11.560 --> 00:06:15.190

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:17.950
