00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:13.030 
and

00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:15.240 
and
one<00:02:13.210> meal<00:02:13.540> I'd<00:02:13.810> say<00:02:14.080> my<00:02:14.350> record<00:02:14.800> I'm<00:02:15.070> pretty

00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:15.250 
one meal I'd say my record I'm pretty

00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:17.910 
one meal I'd say my record I'm pretty
sure<00:02:15.340> my<00:02:15.430> record<00:02:15.730> is<00:02:15.820> 21<00:02:16.630> bananas<00:02:17.260> in<00:02:17.440> one<00:02:17.680> meal

00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:17.920 
sure my record is 21 bananas in one meal

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:20.700 
sure my record is 21 bananas in one meal
and<00:02:18.160> I<00:02:18.550> show<00:02:18.820> that<00:02:19.090> in<00:02:19.240> my<00:02:19.360> 51<00:02:19.870> bananas<00:02:20.410> in<00:02:20.560> one

00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:20.710 
and I show that in my 51 bananas in one

00:02:20.710 --> 00:02:23.100 
and I show that in my 51 bananas in one
day<00:02:20.890> video<00:02:21.250> as<00:02:21.550> well<00:02:21.730> so<00:02:21.790> 21<00:02:22.540> bananas<00:02:22.990> is

00:02:23.100 --> 00:02:23.110 
day video as well so 21 bananas is

00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:25.440 
day video as well so 21 bananas is
around<00:02:23.320> 2,100<00:02:24.190> calories<00:02:24.310> that's<00:02:25.090> a<00:02:25.240> good

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:25.450 
around 2,100 calories that's a good

00:02:25.450 --> 00:02:28.140 
around 2,100 calories that's a good
effort<00:02:25.690> the<00:02:26.320> thing<00:02:26.500> is<00:02:26.620> we<00:02:26.860> are<00:02:27.100> frugivores<00:02:27.670> by

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:28.150 
effort the thing is we are frugivores by

00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:29.790 
effort the thing is we are frugivores by
design<00:02:28.570> we<00:02:28.840> are<00:02:28.930> designed<00:02:29.230> to<00:02:29.380> eat<00:02:29.530> large

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:29.800 
design we are designed to eat large

00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:31.890 
design we are designed to eat large
quantities<00:02:29.950> of<00:02:30.550> fruit<00:02:30.970> our<00:02:31.180> Natalie<00:02:31.720> our

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:31.900 
quantities of fruit our Natalie our

00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:35.010 
quantities of fruit our Natalie our
physiology<00:02:32.200> is<00:02:32.680> wired<00:02:33.190> up<00:02:33.490> that<00:02:33.850> way<00:02:34.090> so<00:02:34.450> fruit

00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:35.020 
physiology is wired up that way so fruit

00:02:35.020 --> 00:02:36.870 
physiology is wired up that way so fruit
is<00:02:35.170> relatively<00:02:35.680> low<00:02:35.920> in<00:02:36.130> calories<00:02:36.490> so<00:02:36.610> we<00:02:36.700> need

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:36.880 
is relatively low in calories so we need

00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:38.850 
is relatively low in calories so we need
to<00:02:37.000> eat<00:02:37.180> enough<00:02:37.480> of<00:02:37.660> it<00:02:37.810> to<00:02:38.200> become<00:02:38.470> satisfied

00:02:38.850 --> 00:02:38.860 
to eat enough of it to become satisfied

00:02:38.860 --> 00:02:41.460 
to eat enough of it to become satisfied
to<00:02:39.400> meet<00:02:39.640> our<00:02:39.880> needs<00:02:40.240> and<00:02:40.600> the<00:02:40.660> cool<00:02:41.140> thing<00:02:41.170> is

00:02:41.460 --> 00:02:41.470 
to meet our needs and the cool thing is

00:02:41.470 --> 00:02:43.680 
to meet our needs and the cool thing is
our<00:02:41.650> bellies<00:02:42.010> are<00:02:42.190> designed<00:02:42.520> to<00:02:42.700> stretch<00:02:43.390> to

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:43.690 
our bellies are designed to stretch to

00:02:43.690 --> 00:02:45.690 
our bellies are designed to stretch to
accommodate<00:02:43.780> large<00:02:44.620> amounts<00:02:45.160> of<00:02:45.280> fruit<00:02:45.550> and

00:02:45.690 --> 00:02:45.700 
accommodate large amounts of fruit and

00:02:45.700 --> 00:02:48.510 
accommodate large amounts of fruit and
then<00:02:46.150> go<00:02:46.420> back<00:02:46.780> to<00:02:46.810> how<00:02:47.170> they<00:02:47.200> were<00:02:47.410> hence<00:02:48.220> why

00:02:48.510 --> 00:02:48.520 
then go back to how they were hence why

00:02:48.520 --> 00:02:51.030 
then go back to how they were hence why
I<00:02:48.550> have<00:02:49.120> a<00:02:49.150> nice<00:02:49.450> flat<00:02:49.660> stomach<00:02:50.170> you<00:02:50.350> know<00:02:50.470> 95

00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:51.040 
I have a nice flat stomach you know 95

00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:52.860 
I have a nice flat stomach you know 95
percent<00:02:51.370> of<00:02:51.430> time<00:02:51.610> other<00:02:51.940> than<00:02:52.390> when<00:02:52.690> I'm

00:02:52.860 --> 00:02:52.870 
percent of time other than when I'm

00:02:52.870 --> 00:02:54.570 
percent of time other than when I'm
obviously<00:02:53.050> when<00:02:53.830> I've<00:02:53.920> had<00:02:53.950> like<00:02:54.280> a<00:02:54.310> large

00:02:54.570 --> 00:02:54.580 
obviously when I've had like a large

00:02:54.580 --> 00:02:56.370 
obviously when I've had like a large
fruit<00:02:54.910> meal<00:02:55.090> then<00:02:55.360> it<00:02:55.510> expands<00:02:56.020> but<00:02:56.140> it<00:02:56.230> goes

00:02:56.370 --> 00:02:56.380 
fruit meal then it expands but it goes

00:02:56.380 --> 00:02:58.530 
fruit meal then it expands but it goes
down<00:02:56.680> really<00:02:57.010> quickly<00:02:57.370> because<00:02:57.820> fruit<00:02:58.390> is

00:02:58.530 --> 00:02:58.540 
down really quickly because fruit is

00:02:58.540 --> 00:02:59.910 
down really quickly because fruit is
almost<00:02:58.900> all<00:02:59.170> water

00:02:59.910 --> 00:02:59.920 
almost all water

00:02:59.920 --> 00:03:02.160 
almost all water
it's<00:03:00.280> like<00:03:00.580> upwards<00:03:01.090> most<00:03:01.450> of<00:03:01.570> its<00:03:01.690> upwards<00:03:02.020> of

00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:02.170 
it's like upwards most of its upwards of

00:03:02.170 --> 00:03:05.010 
it's like upwards most of its upwards of
70%<00:03:02.709> water<00:03:03.430> so<00:03:03.820> you're<00:03:04.000> just<00:03:04.209> filling<00:03:04.900> your

00:03:05.010 --> 00:03:05.020 
70% water so you're just filling your

00:03:05.020 --> 00:03:07.979 
70% water so you're just filling your
belly<00:03:05.290> with<00:03:05.530> a<00:03:05.560> lot<00:03:05.739> of<00:03:05.770> water<00:03:06.130> and<00:03:06.580> fiber<00:03:07.330> so

00:03:07.979 --> 00:03:07.989 
belly with a lot of water and fiber so

00:03:07.989 --> 00:03:09.960 
belly with a lot of water and fiber so
after<00:03:08.290> you<00:03:08.380> have<00:03:08.440> your<00:03:08.590> meal<00:03:08.980> and<00:03:09.310> then<00:03:09.520> within

after you have your meal and then within

00:03:09.970 --> 00:03:12.330 
after you have your meal and then within
half<00:03:10.630> an<00:03:10.810> hour<00:03:10.959> an<00:03:11.290> hour<00:03:11.440> you'll<00:03:11.860> be<00:03:11.890> going<00:03:12.190> to

00:03:12.330 --> 00:03:12.340 
half an hour an hour you'll be going to

00:03:12.340 --> 00:03:13.949 
half an hour an hour you'll be going to
the<00:03:12.459> toilet<00:03:12.850> you'll<00:03:12.970> be<00:03:13.090> peeing<00:03:13.450> and<00:03:13.840> you'll

the toilet you'll be peeing and you'll

00:03:13.959 --> 00:03:16.170 
the toilet you'll be peeing and you'll
be<00:03:14.080> peeing<00:03:14.350> a<00:03:14.530> lot<00:03:14.739> of<00:03:14.920> that<00:03:15.130> water<00:03:15.489> out<00:03:15.790> from

ok so let's take a look at some facts

00:03:46.329 --> 00:03:48.120 
ok so let's take a look at some facts
about<00:03:46.510> bananas<00:03:47.230> but<00:03:47.410> not<00:03:47.530> as<00:03:47.680> a<00:03:47.709> sweet

00:03:48.120 --> 00:03:48.130 
about bananas but not as a sweet

00:03:48.130 --> 00:03:50.190 
about bananas but not as a sweet
satisfying<00:03:49.090> and<00:03:49.329> they<00:03:49.450> fill<00:03:49.690> you<00:03:49.810> up<00:03:49.840> so<00:03:50.140> you

00:03:51.810 --> 00:03:51.820 
don't want to reach for high-fat foods

00:03:51.820 --> 00:03:53.580 
don't want to reach for high-fat foods
or<00:03:52.060> animal<00:03:52.420> products<00:03:52.750> because<00:03:53.350> they're<00:03:53.500> the

00:03:53.580 --> 00:03:53.590 
or animal products because they're the

00:03:53.590 --> 00:03:56.069 
or animal products because they're the
perfect<00:03:54.070> balance<00:03:54.220> of<00:03:54.489> water<00:03:54.730> fibre<00:03:55.329> and<00:03:55.660> sugar

00:03:56.069 --> 00:03:56.079 
perfect balance of water fibre and sugar

00:03:56.079 --> 00:03:58.500 
perfect balance of water fibre and sugar
and<00:03:56.230> that<00:03:56.590> leaves<00:03:56.890> you<00:03:57.130> completely<00:03:57.549> satisfied

00:04:00.240 --> 00:04:00.250 
if you eat enough of them so let's take

00:04:00.250 --> 00:04:01.740 
if you eat enough of them so let's take
a<00:04:00.280> look<00:04:00.430> at<00:04:00.579> a<00:04:00.610> 10<00:04:00.820> banana<00:04:01.150> meal<00:04:01.420> it<00:04:01.600> has

00:04:01.740 --> 00:04:01.750 
a look at a 10 banana meal it has

00:04:01.750 --> 00:04:04.740 
a look at a 10 banana meal it has
approximately<00:04:02.100> 35<00:04:03.100> grams<00:04:03.579> of<00:04:03.820> fiber<00:04:04.090> if<00:04:04.600> you

00:04:04.740 --> 00:04:04.750 
approximately 35 grams of fiber if you

00:04:04.750 --> 00:04:08.069 
approximately 35 grams of fiber if you
can<00:04:04.870> pan<00:04:05.110> it<00:04:05.260> to<00:04:05.380> a<00:04:05.410> steak<00:04:05.739> a<00:04:05.950> steak<00:04:06.489> has<00:04:06.790> 0<00:04:07.269> 0

00:04:08.069 --> 00:04:08.079 
can pan it to a steak a steak has 0 0

00:04:08.079 --> 00:04:10.890 
can pan it to a steak a steak has 0 0
grams<00:04:08.410> of<00:04:08.590> fiber<00:04:08.799> and<00:04:09.130> 5<00:04:09.459> is<00:04:09.700> so<00:04:10.030> important<00:04:10.750> to

00:04:10.890 --> 00:04:10.900 
grams of fiber and 5 is so important to

00:04:10.900 --> 00:04:12.990 
grams of fiber and 5 is so important to
your<00:04:11.019> colon<00:04:11.440> health<00:04:11.620> and<00:04:11.950> having<00:04:12.700> a<00:04:12.730> flat

00:04:12.990 --> 00:04:13.000 
your colon health and having a flat

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:15.569 
your colon health and having a flat
belly<00:04:13.239> and<00:04:13.540> to<00:04:14.140> just<00:04:14.350> being<00:04:14.590> healthy<00:04:14.860> or<00:04:15.250> round

00:04:15.569 --> 00:04:15.579 
belly and to just being healthy or round

00:04:15.579 --> 00:04:17.370 
belly and to just being healthy or round
so<00:04:16.180> one<00:04:16.329> of<00:04:16.359> the<00:04:16.479> great<00:04:16.660> things<00:04:16.930> about<00:04:17.049> a<00:04:17.169> big

00:04:17.370 --> 00:04:17.380 
so one of the great things about a big

00:04:17.380 --> 00:04:18.840 
so one of the great things about a big
banana<00:04:17.530> meal<00:04:17.859> is<00:04:18.100> that<00:04:18.130> it's<00:04:18.400> so<00:04:18.549> good<00:04:18.700> for

00:04:18.840 --> 00:04:18.850 
banana meal is that it's so good for

00:04:18.850 --> 00:04:20.490 
banana meal is that it's so good for
your<00:04:18.910> stomach<00:04:19.030> and<00:04:19.450> your<00:04:19.690> colon<00:04:20.140> because<00:04:20.260> it

00:04:20.490 --> 00:04:20.500 
your stomach and your colon because it

00:04:20.500 --> 00:04:22.620 
your stomach and your colon because it
fills<00:04:20.859> you<00:04:21.039> up<00:04:21.070> and<00:04:21.459> then<00:04:21.880> you<00:04:21.910> are<00:04:22.120> satisfied

00:04:22.620 --> 00:04:22.630 
fills you up and then you are satisfied

00:04:22.630 --> 00:04:24.630 
fills you up and then you are satisfied
and<00:04:22.810> it<00:04:22.930> tells<00:04:23.200> your<00:04:23.380> brain<00:04:23.590> to<00:04:23.919> stop<00:04:24.340> eating

00:04:24.630 --> 00:04:24.640 
and it tells your brain to stop eating

00:04:24.640 --> 00:04:25.990 
and it tells your brain to stop eating
so<00:04:24.940> you<00:04:25.150> don't<00:04:25.539> reach

00:04:25.990 --> 00:04:26.000 
so you don't reach

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:28.210 
so you don't reach
junk<00:04:26.300> food<00:04:26.360> so<00:04:27.200> our<00:04:27.350> bodies<00:04:27.650> are<00:04:27.680> perfectly

00:04:28.210 --> 00:04:28.220 
junk food so our bodies are perfectly

00:04:28.220 --> 00:04:30.310 
junk food so our bodies are perfectly
adapted<00:04:28.370> to<00:04:28.790> eat<00:04:28.970> and<00:04:29.210> digest<00:04:29.390> sweet<00:04:30.050> fruits

00:04:30.310 --> 00:04:30.320 
adapted to eat and digest sweet fruits

00:04:30.320 --> 00:04:32.170 
adapted to eat and digest sweet fruits
like<00:04:30.470> bananas<00:04:30.890> we<00:04:31.040> have<00:04:31.190> sugar<00:04:31.460> receptors<00:04:32.000> on

00:04:32.170 --> 00:04:32.180 
like bananas we have sugar receptors on

00:04:32.180 --> 00:04:33.880 
like bananas we have sugar receptors on
our<00:04:32.210> tongue<00:04:32.360> for<00:04:32.960> a<00:04:32.990> reason<00:04:33.500> we<00:04:33.800> are

00:04:33.880 --> 00:04:33.890 
our tongue for a reason we are

00:04:33.890 --> 00:04:36.730 
our tongue for a reason we are
natural-born<00:04:34.430> fruit<00:04:35.060> eaters<00:04:35.450> one<00:04:36.200> reason<00:04:36.590> why

00:04:36.730 --> 00:04:36.740 
natural-born fruit eaters one reason why

00:04:36.740 --> 00:04:38.650 
natural-born fruit eaters one reason why
smashing<00:04:37.370> in<00:04:37.460> the<00:04:37.520> bananas<00:04:37.880> does<00:04:38.090> not<00:04:38.360> make

00:04:38.650 --> 00:04:38.660 
smashing in the bananas does not make

00:04:38.660 --> 00:04:41.830 
smashing in the bananas does not make
you<00:04:38.870> fat<00:04:39.080> is<00:04:39.380> dietary<00:04:40.010> thermogenesis<00:04:40.910> so

00:04:41.830 --> 00:04:41.840 
you fat is dietary thermogenesis so

00:04:41.840 --> 00:04:44.050 
you fat is dietary thermogenesis so
basically<00:04:42.380> put<00:04:42.650> the<00:04:43.010> heat<00:04:43.250> that<00:04:43.490> is<00:04:43.640> created

00:04:44.050 --> 00:04:44.060 
basically put the heat that is created

00:04:44.060 --> 00:04:45.640 
basically put the heat that is created
from<00:04:44.150> the<00:04:44.300> normal<00:04:44.660> functioning<00:04:45.170> of<00:04:45.290> the<00:04:45.500> body

00:04:45.640 --> 00:04:45.650 
from the normal functioning of the body

00:04:45.650 --> 00:04:47.830 
from the normal functioning of the body
such<00:04:45.980> as<00:04:46.010> digesting<00:04:46.640> food<00:04:46.880> actually<00:04:47.540> burns

00:04:47.830 --> 00:04:47.840 
such as digesting food actually burns

00:04:47.840 --> 00:04:50.920 
such as digesting food actually burns
off<00:04:48.110> any<00:04:48.500> excess<00:04:49.040> glycogen<00:04:49.760> think<00:04:50.570> of<00:04:50.660> it<00:04:50.780> like

00:04:50.920 --> 00:04:50.930 
off any excess glycogen think of it like

00:04:50.930 --> 00:04:52.870 
off any excess glycogen think of it like
a<00:04:50.990> tank<00:04:51.440> or<00:04:51.590> petrol<00:04:51.950> in<00:04:52.040> a<00:04:52.100> car<00:04:52.310> as<00:04:52.490> the<00:04:52.640> tank

00:04:52.870 --> 00:04:52.880 
a tank or petrol in a car as the tank

00:04:52.880 --> 00:04:54.790

earlier<00:04:59.360> is<00:04:59.570> 51<00:05:00.410> and<00:05:00.680> they're<00:05:00.919> obviously<00:05:01.070> not

00:05:01.630 --> 00:05:01.640 
earlier is 51 and they're obviously not

00:05:01.640 --> 00:05:04.180 
earlier is 51 and they're obviously not
making<00:05:02.150> me<00:05:02.300> fat<00:05:02.570> I've<00:05:03.080> eaten<00:05:03.350> more<00:05:03.650> bananas

00:05:04.180 --> 00:05:04.190 
making me fat I've eaten more bananas

00:05:04.190 --> 00:05:06.640 
making me fat I've eaten more bananas
than<00:05:04.430> any<00:05:04.669> other<00:05:05.060> female<00:05:05.540> on<00:05:05.930> the<00:05:05.960> planet<00:05:06.470> over

the<00:05:06.830> last<00:05:07.070> eight<00:05:07.400> years<00:05:07.810> so<00:05:08.810> if<00:05:08.900> they<00:05:09.050> really

00:05:09.220 --> 00:05:09.230 
the last eight years so if they really

00:05:09.230 --> 00:05:11.020 
the last eight years so if they really
made<00:05:09.500> you<00:05:09.590> fat<00:05:09.770> then<00:05:10.040> I<00:05:10.190> would<00:05:10.400> be<00:05:10.580> obese

00:05:11.020 --> 00:05:11.030 
made you fat then I would be obese

00:05:11.030 --> 00:05:13.630 
made you fat then I would be obese
instead<00:05:11.540> of<00:05:11.630> the<00:05:11.720> best<00:05:11.960> shape<00:05:12.230> of<00:05:12.440> my<00:05:12.500> life<00:05:12.650> so

instead of the best shape of my life so

00:05:13.640 --> 00:05:14.740 
instead of the best shape of my life so
there's<00:05:13.850> a<00:05:13.880> lot<00:05:14.000> of<00:05:14.030> people<00:05:14.270> out<00:05:14.390> there<00:05:14.600> who

00:05:14.740 --> 00:05:14.750 
there's a lot of people out there who

00:05:14.750 --> 00:05:16.450 
there's a lot of people out there who
don't<00:05:14.900> understand<00:05:15.440> that<00:05:15.710> bananas<00:05:16.250> actually

00:05:16.450 --> 00:05:16.460 
don't understand that bananas actually

00:05:16.460 --> 00:05:19.060 
don't understand that bananas actually
contain<00:05:17.030> fat<00:05:17.330> they<00:05:17.540> contain<00:05:17.930> good<00:05:18.140> fats<00:05:18.500> the

00:05:19.060 --> 00:05:19.070 
contain fat they contain good fats the

00:05:27.790 --> 00:05:27.800 
grams of carbohydrates which is awesome

00:05:27.800 --> 00:05:30.190 
grams of carbohydrates which is awesome
because<00:05:27.919> that's<00:05:28.190> like<00:05:28.340> pure<00:05:28.700> energy<00:05:29.090> so<00:05:30.020> let's

00:05:30.190 --> 00:05:30.200 
because that's like pure energy so let's

00:05:30.200 --> 00:05:31.420 
because that's like pure energy so let's
get<00:05:30.290> on<00:05:30.410> to<00:05:30.440> everybody's<00:05:31.070> favorite<00:05:31.100> subject

00:05:31.420 --> 00:05:31.430 
get on to everybody's favorite subject

00:05:31.430 --> 00:05:33.400 
get on to everybody's favorite subject
which<00:05:31.970> is<00:05:32.000> potassium<00:05:32.570> whenever<00:05:33.140> you<00:05:33.200> tell

00:05:33.400 --> 00:05:33.410 
which is potassium whenever you tell

00:05:33.410 --> 00:05:34.840 
which is potassium whenever you tell
people<00:05:33.590> you're<00:05:33.919> having<00:05:34.070> a<00:05:34.280> lot<00:05:34.400> of<00:05:34.490> bananas

00:05:34.840 --> 00:05:34.850 
people you're having a lot of bananas

00:05:34.850 --> 00:05:37.180 
people you're having a lot of bananas
they're<00:05:35.000> like<00:05:35.150> oh<00:05:35.270> my<00:05:35.300> god<00:05:35.600> the<00:05:35.780> potassium<00:05:36.190> but

00:05:37.180 --> 00:05:37.190 
they're like oh my god the potassium but

00:05:37.190 --> 00:05:38.680 
they're like oh my god the potassium but
you<00:05:37.280> don't<00:05:37.430> have<00:05:37.520> to<00:05:37.640> worry<00:05:37.820> okay<00:05:37.880> bananas<00:05:38.540> are

00:05:38.680 --> 00:05:38.690 
you don't have to worry okay bananas are

00:05:38.690 --> 00:05:40.930 
you don't have to worry okay bananas are
absolutely<00:05:39.530> fine<00:05:40.130> when<00:05:40.520> it<00:05:40.610> comes<00:05:40.790> to

00:05:40.930 --> 00:05:40.940 
absolutely fine when it comes to

00:05:40.940 --> 00:05:43.570 
absolutely fine when it comes to
potassium<00:05:41.240> and<00:05:41.810> actually<00:05:42.590> excellent<00:05:43.460> for

00:05:43.570 --> 00:05:43.580 
potassium and actually excellent for

00:05:43.580 --> 00:05:45.040 
potassium and actually excellent for
weight<00:05:43.700> loss<00:05:43.910> because<00:05:44.090> of<00:05:44.330> the<00:05:44.479> potassium<00:05:44.780> the

00:05:45.040 --> 00:05:45.050 
weight loss because of the potassium the

00:05:45.050 --> 00:05:46.780 
weight loss because of the potassium the
potassium<00:05:45.500> helps<00:05:45.650> promote<00:05:45.979> a<00:05:46.340> healthy

00:05:46.780 --> 00:05:46.790 
potassium helps promote a healthy

00:05:46.790 --> 00:05:49.450 
potassium helps promote a healthy
metabolism<00:05:46.910> which<00:05:47.840> in<00:05:48.050> turn<00:05:48.290> burns<00:05:48.650> fat<00:05:49.070> more

00:05:49.450 --> 00:05:49.460 
metabolism which in turn burns fat more

00:05:49.460 --> 00:05:51.940 
metabolism which in turn burns fat more
efficiently<00:05:49.810> so<00:05:50.810> to<00:05:50.870> get<00:05:51.020> the<00:05:51.140> lethal<00:05:51.560> dose<00:05:51.740> of

00:05:51.940 --> 00:05:51.950 
efficiently so to get the lethal dose of

00:05:51.950 --> 00:05:53.530 
efficiently so to get the lethal dose of
potassium<00:05:52.280> you<00:05:52.729> would<00:05:52.970> have<00:05:53.090> to<00:05:53.210> eat<00:05:53.360> about

00:05:53.530 --> 00:05:53.540 
potassium you would have to eat about

00:05:53.540 --> 00:05:55.900 
potassium you would have to eat about
400<00:05:54.410> bananas<00:05:54.800> in<00:05:54.919> under<00:05:55.130> 30<00:05:55.340> seconds<00:05:55.790> and

00:05:55.900 --> 00:05:55.910 
400 bananas in under 30 seconds and

00:05:55.910 --> 00:05:58.510 
400 bananas in under 30 seconds and
digest<00:05:56.390> it<00:05:56.570> so<00:05:56.930> obviously<00:05:57.410> no<00:05:57.740> one<00:05:58.040> can<00:05:58.310> do

00:05:58.510 --> 00:05:58.520 
digest it so obviously no one can do

00:05:58.520 --> 00:05:59.830 
digest it so obviously no one can do
that<00:05:58.550> on<00:05:58.910> the<00:05:59.030> planet<00:05:59.360> even<00:05:59.510> the<00:05:59.690> most

00:05:59.830 --> 00:05:59.840 
that on the planet even the most

00:05:59.840 --> 00:06:01.690 
that on the planet even the most
talented<00:06:00.410> ape<00:06:00.650> out<00:06:00.860> there<00:06:01.130> is<00:06:01.310> not<00:06:01.520> going<00:06:01.640> to
