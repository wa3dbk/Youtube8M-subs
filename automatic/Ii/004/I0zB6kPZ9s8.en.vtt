of my retroactive way of getting into

00:01:30.689 --> 00:01:32.990 
of my retroactive way of getting into
that<00:01:30.780> universe<00:01:31.259> and<00:01:31.560> I'm<00:01:31.770> I'm<00:01:32.250> catching<00:01:32.729> up<00:01:32.820> as

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:33.000 
that universe and I'm I'm catching up as

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:36.109 
that universe and I'm I'm catching up as
we<00:01:33.360> speak<00:01:33.390> I<00:01:33.900> think<00:01:34.229> that<00:01:34.439> uh<00:01:34.470> that<00:01:34.890> it<00:01:35.610> can<00:01:35.880> get

00:01:36.109 --> 00:01:36.119 
we speak I think that uh that it can get

00:01:36.119 --> 00:01:39.010 
we speak I think that uh that it can get
people<00:01:36.479> into<00:01:36.659> anime<00:01:37.079> but<00:01:37.439> um<00:01:37.710> it's<00:01:38.250> not

00:01:39.010 --> 00:01:39.020 
people into anime but um it's not

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:41.719 
people into anime but um it's not
necessarily<00:01:40.020> like<00:01:40.259> the<00:01:40.740> best<00:01:40.950> gateway<00:01:41.430> drug

00:01:41.719 --> 00:01:41.729 
necessarily like the best gateway drug

00:01:41.729 --> 00:01:43.760 
necessarily like the best gateway drug
because<00:01:41.759> its<00:01:42.180> own<00:01:42.450> thing<00:01:42.689> when<00:01:42.990> am<00:01:43.110> arabe<00:01:43.530> I've

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:43.770 
because its own thing when am arabe I've

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:45.740 
because its own thing when am arabe I've
never<00:01:44.310> heard<00:01:44.549> that<00:01:44.610> term<00:01:44.790> before<00:01:45.000> I<00:01:45.479> guess

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:45.750 
never heard that term before I guess

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:47.060 
never heard that term before I guess
what<00:01:45.869> they<00:01:45.990> mean<00:01:46.170> is<00:01:46.320> when<00:01:46.500> their<00:01:46.619> eyes<00:01:46.799> get

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:47.070 
what they mean is when their eyes get

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:48.289 
what they mean is when their eyes get
big<00:01:47.280> and<00:01:47.310> their<00:01:47.490> mouths<00:01:47.670> get<00:01:47.880> too<00:01:48.060> big<00:01:48.270> for
