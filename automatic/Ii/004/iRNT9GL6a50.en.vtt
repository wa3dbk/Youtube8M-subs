 the first 16 drive directly internet for 

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:37.980
 that 's just the cable off instead of that 

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:38.870
 is just 210 two tenths of a second 

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:42.090
 I have to really say that 

00:00:38.870 --> 00:00:44.730
 excellent I 'm sure that 

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:46.320
 vettel is already 112 3 this morning 

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:49.019
 Drove there you already have him 

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:51.089
 realistic frame of a realistic 

00:00:49.019 --> 00:00:53.760
 try sebastian 

00:00:51.089 --> 00:00:57.589
 vettel congratulations durchgefahren up in 

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:57.589
 the top ten and here we have the picture 

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:22.710
 hamilton leads in front of heidfeld and alonso 

00:01:21.149 --> 00:01:24.930
 But you know that the times are 

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:27.450
 not so relevant now you drive 

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:28.800
 still with relative in gasoline needs that 

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:31.050
 the steps 

00:01:28.800 --> 00:01:32.580
 go into the race effect 

00:01:31.050 --> 00:01:34.950
 the first few minutes is about the cars 

00:01:32.580 --> 00:01:37.080
 make it easier to make it round 

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:40.170
 to get the course and as much as possible 

00:01:37.080 --> 00:01:42.630
 then benzine will mature 

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:45.060
 changed then it's really only about 

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:47.940
 the sausage is ranked seventh for sebastian 

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:50.220
 vettel and interview space bayern cancer 

00:01:47.940 --> 00:01:51.660
 for Ralf Schumacher and the young man 

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:53.700
 who is now in our midst is completely 

00:01:51.660 --> 00:01:55.650
 also determined sebastian vettel 

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:56.900
 how was that the first time in the 

00:01:55.650 --> 00:01:58.380
 formula 1 by this 

00:01:56.900 --> 00:02:01.110
 Qualification training to have you 

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:02.250
 have it according to the specifications of her 

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:04.890
 chefs year in the lettin last 

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:08.040
 section has to be very exciting 

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:09.690
 So I say in the beginning I was actually 

00:02:08.040 --> 00:02:10.679
 relatively quiet because I knew something 

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:12.000
 I have come from the 

00:02:10.679 --> 00:02:13.980
 qualifying a bit and 

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:16.740
 a bit gathered what now 

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:18.630
 and therefore that was more 

00:02:16.740 --> 00:02:20.820
 or less still relatively light though 

00:02:18.630 --> 00:02:22.590
 Finally, heartbeat then 

00:02:20.820 --> 00:02:24.450
 a little bit more than that 

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:25.950
 It then ripened with the second set in the 

00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:27.150
 quali second was again 

00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:28.730
 but then we think well 

00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:30.720
 mastered and in the last qualifying 

00:02:28.730 --> 00:02:32.250
 would I feel I still believe a 

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:34.620
 but can get a little more 

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:35.760
 I think that driver is never 100 

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:38.540
 percent satisfied 

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:41.010
 how close it can not come if you 

00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:41.430
 mediterranean that gets it the last one 

00:02:41.010 --> 00:02:42.989
 round 

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:44.550
 I do not know what he drove 

00:02:42.989 --> 00:02:46.500
 I'm just a little bit more out of the car 

00:02:44.550 --> 00:02:49.050
 as seven tenths apart okay so from 

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:51.500
 so I think a bit more 

00:02:49.050 --> 00:02:54.570
 but I believe along as predicted 

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:56.070
 Let's see you tomorrow, too 

00:02:54.570 --> 00:02:58.960
 yet betrayed nothing but I believe 

00:02:56.070 --> 00:03:00.880
 In general, we can be satisfied with that 

00:02:58.960 --> 00:03:03.370
 Check it out tomorrow that we first 

00:03:00.880 --> 00:03:04.900
 race to the end and then how is 

00:03:03.370 --> 00:03:06.670
 it's annoying 

00:03:04.900 --> 00:03:08.080
 they have just been told one 

00:03:06.670 --> 00:03:09.250
 it gets a bit more exciting today 

00:03:08.080 --> 00:03:11.740
 quiet night you can be good 

00:03:09.250 --> 00:03:13.180
 try to sleep yes I think so 

00:03:11.740 --> 00:03:14.410
 So now first a giant stone from 

00:03:13.180 --> 00:03:15.490
 heart i believe the worst night 

00:03:14.410 --> 00:03:17.560
 I was behind me from the 

00:03:15.490 --> 00:03:18.700
 thursday on friday against it pretty much 

00:03:17.560 --> 00:03:21.460
 many things through my head 

00:03:18.700 --> 00:03:22.870
 but because the guests had a good day 

00:03:21.460 --> 00:03:25.330
 Today then again, I believe it is 

00:03:22.870 --> 00:03:26.710
 everything is a bit quieter and from 

00:03:25.330 --> 00:03:28.420
 therefore, that fits already confident 

00:03:26.710 --> 00:03:30.700
 you are growing emotional training performance 

00:03:28.420 --> 00:03:32.200
 absolutely great first use 

00:03:30.700 --> 00:03:32.770
 You can only stand in seventh place 

00:03:32.200 --> 00:03:35.230
 to congratulate 

00:03:32.770 --> 00:03:36.880
 So we congratulate and press the 

00:03:35.230 --> 00:03:38.530
 thumbs for tomorrow wishes me calm 

00:03:36.880 --> 00:03:41.050

00:03:43.240 --> 00:03:46.450
 between the two the silver 

00:03:44.650 --> 00:03:48.040
 silvery the right thing we pass 

00:03:46.450 --> 00:03:50.190
 the hard fight between hamilton and 

00:03:48.040 --> 00:03:50.190
 alonso
