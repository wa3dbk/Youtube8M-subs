00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:39.090 
let's I already installed it but it's

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:42.439 
let's I already installed it but it's
totally<00:00:39.239> it's<00:00:39.750> easily<00:00:40.080> available<00:00:41.270> by<00:00:42.270> the<00:00:42.330> way

00:00:42.439 --> 00:00:42.449

00:00:44.570 --> 00:00:44.580 
I have to make sure that your device you

00:00:44.580 --> 00:00:50.149 
I have to make sure that your device you
tried<00:00:45.140> it<00:00:46.140> on<00:00:46.379> it<00:00:46.710> supports<00:00:48.979> Bluetooth<00:00:49.979> Low

00:00:50.149 --> 00:00:50.159 
tried it on it supports Bluetooth Low

00:00:50.159 --> 00:00:56.140 
tried it on it supports Bluetooth Low
Energy<00:00:50.190> because<00:00:51.290> and<00:00:52.290> you<00:00:52.589> have<00:00:52.879> latest

00:00:56.140 --> 00:00:56.150 

00:00:56.150 --> 00:00:59.479 

Android<00:00:57.150> installed<00:00:57.600> I<00:00:57.809> try<00:00:58.769> to<00:00:58.830> older<00:00:59.190> Android

00:00:59.479 --> 00:00:59.489 
Android installed I try to older Android

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:02.270 
Android installed I try to older Android
it<00:00:59.760> did<00:00:59.940> not<00:01:00.089> work<00:01:00.330> properly<00:01:00.570> so<00:01:01.129> anyway<00:01:02.129> this

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:02.280 
it did not work properly so anyway this

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:06.860 
it did not work properly so anyway this
is<00:01:02.339> for<00:01:02.489> for<00:01:02.879> to<00:01:03.470> Android<00:01:04.470> and<00:01:05.780> supposed<00:01:06.780> to

00:01:06.860 --> 00:01:06.870 
is for for to Android and supposed to

00:01:06.870 --> 00:01:08.780 
is for for to Android and supposed to
work<00:01:07.020> here<00:01:07.290> I<00:01:07.470> think<00:01:07.860> first<00:01:08.430> of<00:01:08.490> all<00:01:08.580> have<00:01:08.729> to

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:08.790 
work here I think first of all have to

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:11.539 
work here I think first of all have to
power<00:01:09.120> the<00:01:09.420> device<00:01:09.770> so<00:01:10.770> application<00:01:11.310> called

00:01:11.539 --> 00:01:11.549 
power the device so application called

00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:15.250 
power the device so application called
ble<00:01:12.150> sensor<00:01:12.600> tag<00:01:12.979> and<00:01:13.979> also<00:01:14.340> it's<00:01:14.490> mentioned

00:01:15.250 --> 00:01:15.260 
ble sensor tag and also it's mentioned

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:17.930 
ble sensor tag and also it's mentioned
the<00:01:16.260> sensor<00:01:16.590> tag<00:01:16.770> has<00:01:17.310> sensor<00:01:17.790> tag

00:01:17.930 --> 00:01:17.940 
the sensor tag has sensor tag

00:01:17.940 --> 00:01:19.550 
the sensor tag has sensor tag
application<00:01:18.600> on<00:01:18.810> this<00:01:19.200> little<00:01:19.380> piece<00:01:19.530> of

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:19.560 
application on this little piece of

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:22.580 
application on this little piece of
paper<00:01:19.790> so<00:01:20.790> first<00:01:21.780> understand<00:01:22.140> how<00:01:22.170> to<00:01:22.350> power

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:22.590 
paper so first understand how to power

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:25.580 
paper so first understand how to power
this<00:01:22.770> thing<00:01:23.150> still<00:01:24.150> start<00:01:25.080> blinking<00:01:25.260> green

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:25.590 
this thing still start blinking green

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:28.640 
this thing still start blinking green
LED<00:01:26.070> over<00:01:26.190> here<00:01:26.490> and<00:01:26.810> I<00:01:27.810> guess<00:01:28.020> I<00:01:28.140> have<00:01:28.260> to<00:01:28.290> scan

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:28.650 
LED over here and I guess I have to scan

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:33.110 
LED over here and I guess I have to scan
all<00:01:28.890> right<00:01:29.310> we<00:01:29.490> have<00:01:30.470> we<00:01:31.470> found<00:01:31.710> our<00:01:31.890> device<00:01:32.190> ok

00:01:33.110 --> 00:01:33.120 
all right we have we found our device ok

00:01:33.120 --> 00:01:35.830 
all right we have we found our device ok
gonna<00:01:33.450> tilt<00:01:33.900> it<00:01:34.110> like<00:01:34.140> this

00:01:35.830 --> 00:01:35.840 
gonna tilt it like this

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:44.980 
gonna tilt it like this
let's<00:01:36.840> do<00:01:36.930> connect

00:01:44.980 --> 00:01:44.990 

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:46.400 

here<00:01:45.990> we<00:01:46.110> are

00:01:46.400 --> 00:01:46.410 
here we are

00:01:46.410 --> 00:01:50.180 
here we are
so<00:01:47.240> what<00:01:48.240> we<00:01:48.330> have<00:01:48.510> helped<00:01:49.080> um<00:01:49.260> the<00:01:49.410> ambient

00:01:50.180 --> 00:01:50.190 
so what we have helped um the ambient

00:01:50.190 --> 00:01:52.880 
so what we have helped um the ambient

data<00:01:53.310> pretty<00:01:53.580> cool<00:01:53.730> humidity<00:01:54.450> which<00:01:54.720> is

00:01:55.240 --> 00:01:55.250 
data pretty cool humidity which is

00:01:55.250 --> 00:01:58.160 
data pretty cool humidity which is
that's<00:01:56.250> a<00:01:56.460> zero<00:01:56.850> I<00:01:57.180> don't<00:01:57.360> believe<00:01:57.810> it

00:01:58.160 --> 00:01:58.170 
that's a zero I don't believe it

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:03.100 
that's a zero I don't believe it
cannot<00:01:58.950> be<00:01:59.100> zero<00:01:59.280> in<00:01:59.430> my<00:01:59.580> my<00:02:00.450> house<00:02:01.190> barometer

00:02:03.100 --> 00:02:03.110 
cannot be zero in my my house barometer

cannot be zero in my my house barometer
motion<00:02:04.110> data<00:02:04.320> is<00:02:04.620> nothing<00:02:05.750> looks<00:02:06.750> so<00:02:06.870> much

00:02:06.980 --> 00:02:06.990 
motion data is nothing looks so much

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:18.750 
motion data is nothing looks so much
definitely<00:02:07.530> works<00:02:08.840> yes<00:02:09.840> it<00:02:10.530> is<00:02:10.740> phones

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:18.760 

00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:21.120 

and<00:02:19.270> bring<00:02:19.540> it<00:02:19.660> closer<00:02:20.410> to<00:02:20.530> the<00:02:20.650> light<00:02:20.890> you<00:02:21.069> see

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:21.130 
and bring it closer to the light you see

00:02:21.130 --> 00:02:24.630 
and bring it closer to the light you see
increase<00:02:21.640> the<00:02:22.000> blocks<00:02:22.630> number<00:02:23.520> there<00:02:24.520> is<00:02:24.610> a

00:02:24.630 --> 00:02:24.640 
increase the blocks number there is a

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:27.240 
increase the blocks number there is a
little<00:02:24.880> button<00:02:25.060> here<00:02:25.480> you<00:02:26.380> see<00:02:26.590> it<00:02:26.650> reacts<00:02:26.980> to

00:02:27.240 --> 00:02:27.250 
little button here you see it reacts to

00:02:27.250 --> 00:02:29.180 
little button here you see it reacts to
my<00:02:27.459> presser

00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:29.190 
my presser

00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:31.740 
my presser
yeah<00:02:30.190> I'm<00:02:30.340> just<00:02:30.489> curious<00:02:30.670> what<00:02:31.000> this<00:02:31.480> thing

00:02:31.740 --> 00:02:31.750 
yeah I'm just curious what this thing

00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:38.210 
yeah I'm just curious what this thing
think<00:02:32.500> don't<00:02:32.739> work<00:02:33.280> especially<00:02:33.910> humidity<00:02:34.720> I

00:02:38.210 --> 00:02:38.220 

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:40.559 

don't<00:02:39.220> see<00:02:39.340> anything<00:02:39.610> about<00:02:39.940> digital

00:02:40.559 --> 00:02:40.569 
don't see anything about digital

00:02:40.569 --> 00:02:43.620 
don't see anything about digital
microphone<00:02:40.989> here<00:02:41.260> so<00:02:41.500> I<00:02:41.530> don't<00:02:41.950> know<00:02:42.630> where

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:43.630 
microphone here so I don't know where

00:02:43.630 --> 00:02:49.050 
microphone here so I don't know where
it's<00:02:43.750> supposed<00:02:44.050> to<00:02:44.140> be<00:02:44.319> oh<00:02:47.190> yeah<00:02:48.190> an<00:02:48.550> infrared

00:02:49.050 --> 00:02:49.060 
it's supposed to be oh yeah an infrared

00:02:49.060 --> 00:02:51.930 
it's supposed to be oh yeah an infrared
sensor<00:02:49.980> started<00:02:50.980> reading<00:02:51.190> probably<00:02:51.730> the

00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:51.940 
sensor started reading probably the

00:02:51.940 --> 00:02:53.490 
sensor started reading probably the
temperature<00:02:52.330> of<00:02:52.390> my<00:02:52.510> finger<00:02:52.750> here<00:02:52.989> which<00:02:53.260> says

00:02:53.490 --> 00:02:53.500 
temperature of my finger here which says

00:02:53.500 --> 00:02:57.330 
temperature of my finger here which says
33<00:02:54.600> well<00:02:55.600> it<00:02:55.810> definitely<00:02:55.959> increased<00:02:56.560> but<00:02:56.860> it's

00:02:57.330 --> 00:02:57.340 
33 well it definitely increased but it's

00:02:57.340 --> 00:03:03.120 
33 well it definitely increased but it's
kind<00:02:57.519> of<00:02:58.500> ballpark<00:02:59.500> values<00:03:00.250> there<00:03:01.440> hmm<00:03:02.500> my

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:03.130 
kind of ballpark values there hmm my

00:03:03.130 --> 00:03:06.870 
kind of ballpark values there hmm my
motion<00:03:03.519> data<00:03:03.670> doesn't<00:03:03.970> work<00:03:05.340> well<00:03:06.340> let<00:03:06.730> me

00:03:06.870 --> 00:03:06.880 
motion data doesn't work well let me

00:03:06.880 --> 00:03:15.970 
motion data doesn't work well let me
place<00:03:07.239> a<00:03:07.390> little<00:03:07.510> bit<00:03:07.660> more

00:03:15.970 --> 00:03:15.980 

00:03:15.980 --> 00:03:17.839 

okay<00:03:16.980> I'm<00:03:17.189> back

00:03:17.839 --> 00:03:17.849 
okay I'm back

00:03:17.849 --> 00:03:19.429 
okay I'm back
and<00:03:17.970> I<00:03:18.360> actually<00:03:18.629> figured<00:03:18.930> out<00:03:19.170> what's

00:03:19.429 --> 00:03:19.439 
and I actually figured out what's

00:03:19.439 --> 00:03:21.020 
and I actually figured out what's
happened<00:03:19.860> after<00:03:20.519> spending<00:03:20.760> some<00:03:20.970> time

00:03:21.020 --> 00:03:21.030 
happened after spending some time

00:03:21.030 --> 00:03:22.970 
happened after spending some time
figuring<00:03:21.510> out<00:03:21.659> what<00:03:22.079> is<00:03:22.230> the<00:03:22.379> problem<00:03:22.799> why

00:03:22.970 --> 00:03:22.980 
figuring out what is the problem why

00:03:22.980 --> 00:03:25.880 
figuring out what is the problem why
some<00:03:23.610> sensor<00:03:23.970> don't<00:03:24.420> work<00:03:24.659> I<00:03:24.959> thought<00:03:25.439> I<00:03:25.500> broke

00:03:25.880 --> 00:03:25.890 
some sensor don't work I thought I broke

00:03:25.890 --> 00:03:27.710 
some sensor don't work I thought I broke
something<00:03:26.189> this<00:03:26.489> device<00:03:26.760> where<00:03:27.060> I<00:03:27.090> was<00:03:27.299> poking

00:03:27.710 --> 00:03:27.720 
something this device where I was poking

00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:29.449 
something this device where I was poking
my<00:03:27.870> fingers<00:03:28.260> all<00:03:28.560> over<00:03:28.620> the<00:03:28.829> place<00:03:29.040> you<00:03:29.340> know

00:03:29.449 --> 00:03:29.459 
my fingers all over the place you know

00:03:29.459 --> 00:03:31.460 
my fingers all over the place you know
some<00:03:30.209> static<00:03:30.629> electricity<00:03:30.989> and<00:03:31.230> blah<00:03:31.440> blah

00:03:31.460 --> 00:03:31.470 
some static electricity and blah blah

00:03:31.470 --> 00:03:33.589 
some static electricity and blah blah
blah<00:03:31.650> turn<00:03:31.980> out<00:03:32.069> to<00:03:32.190> be<00:03:32.220> everything<00:03:33.150> is<00:03:33.390> so

00:03:33.589 --> 00:03:33.599 
blah turn out to be everything is so

00:03:33.599 --> 00:03:37.280 
blah turn out to be everything is so
much<00:03:33.870> more<00:03:34.079> simpler<00:03:34.560> it<00:03:35.280> just<00:03:35.549> this<00:03:36.079> so<00:03:37.079> just

00:03:37.280 --> 00:03:37.290 
much more simpler it just this so just

00:03:37.290 --> 00:03:38.990 
much more simpler it just this so just
simple<00:03:37.650> battery<00:03:38.099> so<00:03:38.310> apparently<00:03:38.760> this<00:03:38.879> is

00:03:38.990 --> 00:03:39.000 
simple battery so apparently this is

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:41.660 
simple battery so apparently this is
original<00:03:39.360> battery<00:03:39.720> and<00:03:39.900> then<00:03:40.079> kinda<00:03:40.799> low<00:03:41.220> low

00:03:41.660 --> 00:03:41.670 
original battery and then kinda low low

00:03:41.670 --> 00:03:45.289 
original battery and then kinda low low
low<00:03:41.700> so<00:03:42.480> when<00:03:43.290> they<00:03:43.379> replace<00:03:43.819> put<00:03:44.819> new<00:03:44.970> battery

00:03:45.289 --> 00:03:45.299 
low so when they replace put new battery

00:03:45.299 --> 00:03:50.740 
low so when they replace put new battery
over<00:03:45.420> here<00:03:45.659> everything<00:03:46.230> works<00:03:46.560> perfectly<00:03:49.310> so

00:03:50.740 --> 00:03:50.750 
over here everything works perfectly so

00:03:50.750 --> 00:03:56.750 
over here everything works perfectly so
we<00:03:51.750> can<00:03:51.989> see<00:03:52.340> some<00:03:54.680> much<00:03:55.680> more<00:03:55.889> data<00:03:56.129> and<00:03:56.489> all

00:03:56.750 --> 00:03:56.760 
we can see some much more data and all

00:03:56.760 --> 00:03:58.399 
we can see some much more data and all
sensors<00:03:57.150> are<00:03:57.329> properly<00:03:57.599> working<00:03:57.840> in<00:03:58.260> this

00:03:58.399 --> 00:03:58.409 
sensors are properly working in this

00:03:58.409 --> 00:04:01.039 
sensors are properly working in this
case<00:03:58.650> so<00:03:59.639> now<00:04:00.000> we<00:04:00.060> have<00:04:00.209> community<00:04:00.599> data<00:04:00.750> which

00:04:01.039 --> 00:04:01.049 
case so now we have community data which

00:04:01.049 --> 00:04:04.970 
case so now we have community data which
is<00:04:01.170> showing<00:04:02.069> 43<00:04:02.879> percent<00:04:03.859> durometer<00:04:04.859> is

00:04:04.970 --> 00:04:04.980 
is showing 43 percent durometer is

00:04:04.980 --> 00:04:07.809 
is showing 43 percent durometer is
working<00:04:05.400> and<00:04:05.579> most<00:04:05.730> interesting<00:04:06.239> thing<00:04:06.420> that

00:04:07.809 --> 00:04:07.819 
working and most interesting thing that

00:04:07.819 --> 00:04:11.000 
working and most interesting thing that
motion<00:04:08.819> data<00:04:09.269> is<00:04:09.540> working<00:04:09.959> so<00:04:10.560> now<00:04:10.590> we<00:04:10.799> have

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:11.010 
motion data is working so now we have

00:04:11.010 --> 00:04:13.640 
motion data is working so now we have
like<00:04:11.269> accelerometer<00:04:12.269> information<00:04:13.049> gyroscope

00:04:13.640 --> 00:04:13.650 
like accelerometer information gyroscope

00:04:13.650 --> 00:04:16.370 
like accelerometer information gyroscope
and<00:04:13.799> magnetometer<00:04:14.430> and<00:04:14.690> this<00:04:15.690> is<00:04:15.780> pretty<00:04:16.109> cool

00:04:16.370 --> 00:04:16.380 
and magnetometer and this is pretty cool

00:04:16.380 --> 00:04:17.870 
and magnetometer and this is pretty cool
that's<00:04:16.680> actually<00:04:16.979> why<00:04:17.130> you<00:04:17.190> know<00:04:17.489> I<00:04:17.639> want<00:04:17.820> to

00:04:17.870 --> 00:04:17.880 
that's actually why you know I want to

00:04:17.880 --> 00:04:20.589 
that's actually why you know I want to
play<00:04:18.000> these<00:04:18.709> uses<00:04:19.709> magnetometer

00:04:20.589 --> 00:04:20.599 
play these uses magnetometer

00:04:20.599 --> 00:04:23.060 
play these uses magnetometer
magnetometer<00:04:21.599> accelerometer<00:04:22.049> gyro<00:04:22.410> on<00:04:22.830> they

00:04:23.060 --> 00:04:23.070 
magnetometer accelerometer gyro on they

00:04:23.070 --> 00:04:26.870 
magnetometer accelerometer gyro on they
think<00:04:24.380> alright<00:04:25.380> I'm<00:04:25.710> just<00:04:25.770> curious<00:04:26.280> why<00:04:26.849> the

00:04:26.870 --> 00:04:26.880 
think alright I'm just curious why the

00:04:26.880 --> 00:04:29.390 
think alright I'm just curious why the
battery<00:04:27.479> died<00:04:28.020> so<00:04:28.349> quickly<00:04:28.380> unless<00:04:29.130> they<00:04:29.370> just

00:04:29.390 --> 00:04:29.400 
battery died so quickly unless they just

00:04:29.400 --> 00:04:32.510 
battery died so quickly unless they just
you<00:04:30.180> know<00:04:30.620> text<00:04:31.620> instrumental<00:04:32.190> whoever

00:04:32.510 --> 00:04:32.520 
you know text instrumental whoever

00:04:32.520 --> 00:04:34.370 
you know text instrumental whoever
distribute<00:04:32.940> these<00:04:33.090> things<00:04:33.300> put<00:04:33.630> like<00:04:33.840> you

00:04:34.370 --> 00:04:34.380 
distribute these things put like you

00:04:34.380 --> 00:04:36.350 
distribute these things put like you
know<00:04:34.410> kind<00:04:35.340> of<00:04:35.370> iffy<00:04:35.639> batteries<00:04:36.030> at<00:04:36.180> first

00:04:36.350 --> 00:04:36.360 
know kind of iffy batteries at first

00:04:36.360 --> 00:04:39.350 
know kind of iffy batteries at first
place<00:04:37.099> or<00:04:38.099> maybe<00:04:38.400> because<00:04:38.729> we<00:04:39.000> running<00:04:39.210> so

00:04:39.350 --> 00:04:39.360 
place or maybe because we running so

00:04:39.360 --> 00:04:42.129 
place or maybe because we running so
many<00:04:39.889> different<00:04:40.889> sensors<00:04:41.250> simultaneously

00:04:42.129 --> 00:04:42.139 
many different sensors simultaneously

00:04:42.139 --> 00:04:44.810 
many different sensors simultaneously
the<00:04:43.139> you<00:04:43.560> know<00:04:43.650> better<00:04:43.860> consumptions<00:04:44.430> pretty

00:04:44.810 --> 00:04:44.820 
the you know better consumptions pretty

00:04:44.820 --> 00:04:48.020 
the you know better consumptions pretty
high<00:04:45.320> that's<00:04:46.320> that's<00:04:47.130> possible<00:04:47.729> that's

00:04:48.020 --> 00:04:48.030 
high that's that's possible that's

00:04:48.030 --> 00:04:51.020 
high that's that's possible that's
possible<00:04:48.510> I<00:04:48.720> did<00:04:49.710> not<00:04:49.979> place<00:04:50.430> this<00:04:50.699> thing<00:04:50.910> at

00:04:51.020 --> 00:04:51.030 
possible I did not place this thing at

00:04:51.030 --> 00:04:53.120 
possible I did not place this thing at
all<00:04:51.210> like<00:04:51.479> it<00:04:51.690> just<00:04:52.139> was<00:04:52.380> sitting<00:04:52.530> in<00:04:52.800> the<00:04:52.889> box

00:04:53.120 --> 00:04:53.130 
all like it just was sitting in the box

00:04:53.130 --> 00:04:56.210 
all like it just was sitting in the box
with<00:04:53.789> this<00:04:53.970> little<00:04:54.240> plastic<00:04:54.360> top<00:04:54.900> in<00:04:55.860> so<00:04:56.190> I

00:04:56.210 --> 00:04:56.220 
with this little plastic top in so I

00:04:56.220 --> 00:04:57.529 
with this little plastic top in so I
assumed<00:04:56.520> it<00:04:56.639> was<00:04:56.789> not<00:04:56.970> consuming<00:04:57.419> any

00:04:57.529 --> 00:04:57.539 
assumed it was not consuming any

00:04:57.539 --> 00:04:59.960 
assumed it was not consuming any
anything<00:04:58.349> because<00:04:58.680> the<00:04:58.770> plastic<00:04:59.159> there<00:04:59.789> the

00:04:59.960 --> 00:04:59.970 
anything because the plastic there the

00:04:59.970 --> 00:05:04.709 
anything because the plastic there the
battery<00:05:00.389> was<00:05:00.510> essentially<00:05:00.900> not<00:05:01.050> connected

00:05:04.709 --> 00:05:04.719 

00:05:04.719 --> 00:05:07.350 

so<00:05:05.709> I'm<00:05:06.069> not<00:05:06.459> sure<00:05:06.610> I<00:05:06.819> have<00:05:06.999> to<00:05:07.089> do<00:05:07.209> some

00:05:07.350 --> 00:05:07.360 
so I'm not sure I have to do some

00:05:07.360 --> 00:05:09.179 
so I'm not sure I have to do some
research<00:05:07.509> and<00:05:08.139> figure<00:05:08.439> out<00:05:08.619> what<00:05:08.979> is<00:05:09.099> the

00:05:09.179 --> 00:05:09.189 
research and figure out what is the

00:05:09.189 --> 00:05:12.059 
research and figure out what is the
battery<00:05:09.519> what<00:05:09.759> is<00:05:09.909> the<00:05:10.059> consumption<00:05:11.069> standby

00:05:12.059 --> 00:05:12.069 
battery what is the consumption standby

00:05:12.069 --> 00:05:14.159 
battery what is the consumption standby
consumption<00:05:12.519> or<00:05:12.819> actually<00:05:13.299> a<00:05:13.329> operational

00:05:14.159 --> 00:05:14.169 
consumption or actually a operational

00:05:14.169 --> 00:05:16.100 
consumption or actually a operational
consumption<00:05:14.679> of<00:05:14.799> this<00:05:14.949> little<00:05:15.219> unit<00:05:15.429> here<00:05:15.489> I

00:05:16.100 --> 00:05:16.110 
consumption of this little unit here I

00:05:16.110 --> 00:05:19.519 
consumption of this little unit here I
would<00:05:17.110> like<00:05:17.259> to<00:05:17.379> know<00:05:17.469> also<00:05:17.679> how<00:05:18.579> much<00:05:18.789> cheap

00:05:19.519 --> 00:05:19.529 
would like to know also how much cheap

00:05:19.529 --> 00:05:21.359 
would like to know also how much cheap
what<00:05:20.529> is<00:05:20.619> the<00:05:20.679> cheap<00:05:20.860> consumption

00:05:21.359 --> 00:05:21.369 
what is the cheap consumption

00:05:21.369 --> 00:05:23.339 
what is the cheap consumption
consumption<00:05:21.729> itself<00:05:22.179> and<00:05:22.389> how<00:05:23.019> much<00:05:23.169> energy

00:05:23.339 --> 00:05:23.349 
consumption itself and how much energy

00:05:23.349 --> 00:05:25.559 
consumption itself and how much energy
take<00:05:23.860> each<00:05:24.369> of<00:05:24.549> those<00:05:24.669> sensor<00:05:25.089> take<00:05:25.329> because

00:05:25.559 --> 00:05:25.569 
take each of those sensor take because

00:05:25.569 --> 00:05:27.959 
take each of those sensor take because
some<00:05:25.719> of<00:05:25.749> them<00:05:25.929> are<00:05:26.049> passive<00:05:27.009> like<00:05:27.489> I<00:05:27.549> assume

00:05:27.959 --> 00:05:27.969 
some of them are passive like I assume

00:05:27.969 --> 00:05:34.889 
some of them are passive like I assume
that<00:05:27.999> for<00:05:28.449> example<00:05:32.759> durometer<00:05:33.779> could<00:05:34.779> be

00:05:34.889 --> 00:05:34.899 
that for example durometer could be

00:05:34.899 --> 00:05:36.089 
that for example durometer could be
passive

00:05:36.089 --> 00:05:36.099 
passive

00:05:36.099 --> 00:05:38.489 
passive
you<00:05:36.339> know<00:05:36.539> maybe<00:05:37.539> digital<00:05:37.959> microphone<00:05:38.259> is

00:05:38.489 --> 00:05:38.499 
you know maybe digital microphone is

00:05:38.499 --> 00:05:41.669 
you know maybe digital microphone is
passive<00:05:38.860> and<00:05:39.039> so<00:05:39.759> on<00:05:39.939> like<00:05:40.149> you<00:05:40.749> know<00:05:40.869> anyways

00:05:41.669 --> 00:05:41.679 
passive and so on like you know anyways

00:05:41.679 --> 00:05:44.429 
passive and so on like you know anyways
so<00:05:42.279> that's<00:05:42.519> something<00:05:42.759> to<00:05:43.229> investigate<00:05:44.229> by

00:05:44.429 --> 00:05:44.439 
so that's something to investigate by

00:05:44.439 --> 00:05:46.350 
so that's something to investigate by
the<00:05:44.499> way<00:05:44.619> some<00:05:44.949> of<00:05:44.979> the<00:05:45.099> sensors<00:05:45.429> can<00:05:45.550> actually

00:05:46.350 --> 00:05:46.360 
the way some of the sensors can actually

00:05:46.360 --> 00:05:50.209 
the way some of the sensors can actually
I<00:05:46.599> just<00:05:47.050> clicked<00:05:47.679> here<00:05:47.949> we<00:05:48.399> can<00:05:48.610> increase<00:05:48.789> or

00:05:50.209 --> 00:05:50.219 
I just clicked here we can increase or

00:05:50.219 --> 00:05:54.989 
I just clicked here we can increase or
decrease<00:05:51.509> period<00:05:52.509> and<00:05:52.749> you<00:05:52.899> can<00:05:53.050> see<00:05:53.169> like<00:05:53.999> you

00:05:54.989 --> 00:05:54.999 
decrease period and you can see like you

00:05:54.999 --> 00:05:57.359 
decrease period and you can see like you
know<00:05:55.149> save<00:05:55.719> the<00:05:55.869> quick<00:05:56.079> update<00:05:56.499> refresh<00:05:57.129> rate

00:05:57.359 --> 00:05:57.369 
know save the quick update refresh rate

00:05:57.369 --> 00:06:01.729 
know save the quick update refresh rate
of<00:05:57.399> the<00:05:58.149> motion<00:05:58.629> data<00:05:58.779> it<00:05:59.079> looks<00:05:59.529> pretty<00:05:59.919> cool

00:06:01.729 --> 00:06:01.739 
of the motion data it looks pretty cool

00:06:01.739 --> 00:06:04.439 
of the motion data it looks pretty cool
very<00:06:02.739> very<00:06:02.889> nice<00:06:03.159> anyways<00:06:03.759> I'm<00:06:03.999> really
