bridge the digital divide in the small
village<00:01:09.380> in<00:01:09.890> Samoa<00:01:10.550> now<00:01:11.300> please<00:01:12.020> permit<00:01:12.530> me<00:01:12.590> to

00:01:12.790 --> 00:01:12.800 
village in Samoa now please permit me to

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:14.950 
village in Samoa now please permit me to
talk<00:01:13.220> about<00:01:13.250> the<00:01:13.820> phenomenon<00:01:14.030> of<00:01:14.600> flight

00:01:14.950 --> 00:01:14.960 
talk about the phenomenon of flight

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:18.100 
talk about the phenomenon of flight
because<00:01:15.620> as<00:01:16.040> a<00:01:16.430> scientist<00:01:17.150> it<00:01:17.450> makes<00:01:17.870> me<00:01:18.080> very

00:01:18.100 --> 00:01:18.110 
because as a scientist it makes me very

00:01:18.110 --> 00:01:22.990 
because as a scientist it makes me very
excited<00:01:19.420> yeah<00:01:20.590> the<00:01:21.590> airplane<00:01:22.010> can<00:01:22.370> only<00:01:22.550> fly

00:01:22.990 --> 00:01:23.000 
excited yeah the airplane can only fly

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:27.250 
excited yeah the airplane can only fly
it's<00:01:23.420> a<00:01:23.780> wing<00:01:24.050> is<00:01:24.320> the<00:01:24.980> right<00:01:25.520> shape<00:01:26.260> the

00:01:27.250 --> 00:01:27.260 
it's a wing is the right shape the

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:30.880 
it's a wing is the right shape the
bottom<00:01:27.770> must<00:01:28.100> be<00:01:28.310> flat<00:01:28.760> on<00:01:29.090> the<00:01:30.020> top<00:01:30.260> must<00:01:30.680> be

00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:30.890 
bottom must be flat on the top must be

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:34.390 
bottom must be flat on the top must be
curved<00:01:31.420> when<00:01:32.420> the<00:01:32.720> airplane<00:01:33.350> moves<00:01:33.680> forward

00:01:34.390 --> 00:01:34.400 
curved when the airplane moves forward

00:01:34.400 --> 00:01:38.100 
curved when the airplane moves forward
the<00:01:35.330> air<00:01:35.600> particles<00:01:36.200> in<00:01:36.650> front<00:01:37.130> of<00:01:37.400> the<00:01:37.730> wing

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:38.110 
the air particles in front of the wing

00:01:38.110 --> 00:01:42.160 
the air particles in front of the wing
theyíve<00:01:39.110> ago<00:01:39.650> under<00:01:39.980> the<00:01:40.610> wing<00:01:40.880> as<00:01:41.330> I<00:01:41.390> go<00:01:41.930> over

00:01:42.160 --> 00:01:42.170 
theyíve ago under the wing as I go over

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:45.400 
theyíve ago under the wing as I go over
the<00:01:42.890> wing<00:01:43.160> if<00:01:43.460> the<00:01:43.970> air<00:01:44.210> particles<00:01:44.780> they<00:01:45.260> go

00:01:45.400 --> 00:01:45.410 
the wing if the air particles they go

00:01:45.410 --> 00:01:49.090 
the wing if the air particles they go
under<00:01:45.650> the<00:01:46.250> wing<00:01:46.460> they<00:01:47.210> go<00:01:47.420> straight<00:01:47.990> so<00:01:48.890> they

00:01:49.090 --> 00:01:49.100 
under the wing they go straight so they

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:52.660 
under the wing they go straight so they
stay<00:01:49.400> together<00:01:49.670> easy<00:01:50.380> if<00:01:51.380> the<00:01:52.010> air<00:01:52.190> particles

00:01:52.660 --> 00:01:52.670 
stay together easy if the air particles

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:55.990 
stay together easy if the air particles
I<00:01:53.060> go<00:01:53.210> over<00:01:53.450> the<00:01:53.840> wing<00:01:54.080> there<00:01:54.890> goes<00:01:55.130> a<00:01:55.160> long<00:01:55.640> way

00:01:55.990 --> 00:01:56.000 
I go over the wing there goes a long way

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:59.920 
I go over the wing there goes a long way
so<00:01:56.930> the<00:01:57.320> distance<00:01:57.890> between<00:01:58.130> the<00:01:58.880> particles<00:01:59.600> it

00:01:59.920 --> 00:01:59.930 
so the distance between the particles it

00:01:59.930 --> 00:02:04.030 
so the distance between the particles it
stretches<00:02:00.920> out<00:02:01.570> these<00:02:02.570> air<00:02:02.870> particles<00:02:03.440> they

00:02:04.030 --> 00:02:04.040 
stretches out these air particles they

00:02:04.040 --> 00:02:06.460 
stretches out these air particles they
are<00:02:04.250> happy<00:02:04.760> because<00:02:05.300> they<00:02:05.840> have<00:02:06.110> a<00:02:06.140> lot<00:02:06.440> of

00:02:06.460 --> 00:02:06.470 
are happy because they have a lot of

00:02:06.470 --> 00:02:09.070 
are happy because they have a lot of
room<00:02:06.950> just<00:02:07.430> like<00:02:07.580> with<00:02:08.000> the<00:02:08.239> first-class

00:02:09.070 --> 00:02:09.080 
room just like with the first-class

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:13.150 
room just like with the first-class
airline<00:02:09.590> ticket<00:02:10.489> yeah<00:02:11.230> these<00:02:12.230> air<00:02:12.680> particles

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:13.160 
airline ticket yeah these air particles

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:16.390 
airline ticket yeah these air particles
they<00:02:14.090> are<00:02:14.270> unhappy<00:02:15.020> because<00:02:15.230> they<00:02:15.740> have<00:02:16.160> no

00:02:16.390 --> 00:02:16.400 
they are unhappy because they have no

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:16.930 
they are unhappy because they have no
room

00:02:16.930 --> 00:02:16.940 
room

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:19.450 
room
just<00:02:17.450> like<00:02:17.660> with<00:02:17.840> the<00:02:18.020> cheap<00:02:18.380> airline<00:02:18.980> ticket

00:02:19.450 --> 00:02:19.460 
just like with the cheap airline ticket

00:02:19.460 --> 00:02:22.900 
just like with the cheap airline ticket
yeah<00:02:20.110> this<00:02:21.110> means<00:02:21.470> that<00:02:21.650> a<00:02:21.980> low<00:02:22.400> pressure

00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:22.910 
yeah this means that a low pressure

00:02:22.910 --> 00:02:25.960 
yeah this means that a low pressure
forms<00:02:23.630> above<00:02:24.050> serving<00:02:24.710> because<00:02:25.550> the

00:02:25.960 --> 00:02:25.970 
forms above serving because the

00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:29.200 
forms above serving because the
particles<00:02:26.570> are<00:02:27.200> being<00:02:27.560> pulled<00:02:27.950> further<00:02:28.520> apart

00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:29.210 
particles are being pulled further apart

00:02:29.210 --> 00:02:32.800 
particles are being pulled further apart
but<00:02:30.080> the<00:02:30.380> air<00:02:30.560> under<00:02:31.100> the<00:02:31.160> ring<00:02:31.670> stay<00:02:32.360> together

00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:32.810 
but the air under the ring stay together

00:02:32.810 --> 00:02:37.120 
but the air under the ring stay together
easy<00:02:33.790> so<00:02:34.790> the<00:02:35.000> air<00:02:35.210> undeserving<00:02:36.200> they<00:02:36.710> are<00:02:36.920> at

00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:37.130 
easy so the air undeserving they are at

00:02:37.130 --> 00:02:39.550 
easy so the air undeserving they are at
normal<00:02:37.580> pressure<00:02:37.850> but<00:02:38.600> the<00:02:38.780> air<00:02:38.960> above<00:02:39.290> the

00:02:39.550 --> 00:02:39.560 
normal pressure but the air above the

00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:41.980

wings<00:02:39.770> they<00:02:40.010> are<00:02:40.190> at<00:02:40.400> low<00:02:40.640> pressure<00:02:41.060> the

00:02:41.980 --> 00:02:41.990 
wings they are at low pressure the

00:02:41.990 --> 00:02:44.890 
wings they are at low pressure the
fastest<00:02:42.530> airplane<00:02:43.040> moves<00:02:43.670> the<00:02:44.450> faster

00:02:44.890 --> 00:02:44.900 
fastest airplane moves the faster

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:47.620

the<00:02:48.590> more<00:02:48.980> the<00:02:49.280> air<00:02:49.490> particle<00:02:50.090> above<00:02:50.480> serving

00:02:50.980 --> 00:02:50.990 
the more the air particle above serving

00:02:50.990 --> 00:02:53.800 
the more the air particle above serving
they<00:02:51.260> are<00:02:51.380> pulled<00:02:51.680> apart<00:02:51.850> so<00:02:52.850> the<00:02:53.060> faster<00:02:53.540> the

00:02:53.800 --> 00:02:53.810 
they are pulled apart so the faster the

00:02:53.810 --> 00:02:55.750 
they are pulled apart so the faster the
airplane<00:02:54.170> move<00:02:54.380> the<00:02:55.040> Leicester<00:02:55.490> pressure

00:02:55.750 --> 00:02:55.760 
airplane move the Leicester pressure

00:02:55.760 --> 00:02:58.750 
airplane move the Leicester pressure
become<00:02:56.300> above<00:02:56.690> the<00:02:56.900> wing<00:02:57.110> as<00:02:57.410> the<00:02:58.220> plane<00:02:58.490> on

00:02:58.750 --> 00:02:58.760 
become above the wing as the plane on

00:02:58.760 --> 00:03:01.630 
become above the wing as the plane on
the<00:02:58.820> runway<00:02:59.060> it<00:02:59.660> speed<00:02:59.990> increases<00:03:00.860> the<00:03:01.460> air

00:03:01.630 --> 00:03:01.640 
the runway it speed increases the air

00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:04.420 
the runway it speed increases the air
pressure<00:03:01.970> above<00:03:02.690> the<00:03:02.990> wing<00:03:03.260> it<00:03:03.500> becomes<00:03:04.010> so

00:03:04.420 --> 00:03:04.430 
pressure above the wing it becomes so

00:03:04.430 --> 00:03:10.420 
pressure above the wing it becomes so
low<00:03:04.850> that<00:03:05.240> it<00:03:05.630> literally<00:03:08.530> sucks<00:03:09.530> the<00:03:10.160> plane

00:03:10.420 --> 00:03:10.430 
low that it literally sucks the plane

00:03:10.430 --> 00:03:14.140 
low that it literally sucks the plane
into<00:03:10.760> the<00:03:11.000> air<00:03:11.890> the<00:03:12.890> only<00:03:13.280> problem<00:03:13.580> with<00:03:13.970> the

00:03:14.140 --> 00:03:14.150 
into the air the only problem with the

00:03:14.150 --> 00:03:16.360 
into the air the only problem with the
plane<00:03:14.330> going<00:03:14.720> so<00:03:14.990> fast<00:03:15.260> is<00:03:15.650> that<00:03:15.680> it<00:03:16.010> is<00:03:16.160> very

00:03:16.360 --> 00:03:16.370 
plane going so fast is that it is very

00:03:16.370 --> 00:03:20.400 
plane going so fast is that it is very
hard<00:03:16.760> for<00:03:16.970> the<00:03:17.390> plane<00:03:17.660> to<00:03:18.080> stop<00:03:18.460> like<00:03:19.460> this

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:20.410 
hard for the plane to stop like this

00:03:20.410 --> 00:03:32.500 
hard for the plane to stop like this
yeah<00:03:29.770> that<00:03:30.770> is<00:03:30.950> my<00:03:31.130> favorite<00:03:31.370> photo<00:03:32.150> NZ
