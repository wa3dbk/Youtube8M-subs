00:00:08.840 --> 00:00:12.809
 following with the coverage of the anime event 

00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:15.719
 we are here with the singer leonardo 

00:00:12.809 --> 00:00:19.080
 camilo that makes the character that in the series 

00:00:15.719 --> 00:00:21.060
 knights of the river where I wanted to know 

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:28.320
 What was the first character to do that? 

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:35.780
 known in the market the characters are 

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:35.780
 starts online there in 1988 doing 1 x 

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:42.690
 character really just happened 

00:00:40.170 --> 00:01:17.880
 the language that I consider the 

00:00:42.690 --> 00:01:20.430
 gunner was known for his 

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:23.159
 on the street in relation to this already 

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:25.640
 happened sometimes is and more 

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:32.579
 interestingly they were all in a 

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:34.229
 BBQ CearÃ¡ and suddenly we do not 

00:01:32.579 --> 00:01:37.040
 I was with what it is to be different when 

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:41.189
 Are you talking about tubing? 

00:01:37.040 --> 00:01:45.799
 someone begins to imagine what they perceived 

00:01:41.189 --> 00:01:45.799
 the voice of everything easier 

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:51.680
 talking about everything in football 

00:01:52.310 --> 00:02:01.140
 various subjects and all of a sudden a 

00:01:54.899 --> 00:02:05.149
 Little boy was playing there where bond 

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:05.149
 step stopped playing father's vehicular 

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:16.070
 the sefaz do ipa and then I became interested 

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:19.050
 I find it interesting that it is the fact that 

00:02:16.070 --> 00:02:24.810
 never talk image in lec has a 

00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:26.730
 heard and another opportunity I was in 

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:33.690
 cinema was in line and I decided to buy 

00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:38.010
 pop rock and maybe popcorn and guarana 

00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:41.130
 powder in order to protect grace 

00:02:38.010 --> 00:02:43.500
 because I went on continuously 

00:02:41.130 --> 00:02:47.220
 if the guy did not know who held the 

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:56.280
 talk and happen among these people 

00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:58.530
 has a sakineh week wine that started 

00:02:56.280 --> 00:03:07.140
 in the series as a villain and then became 

00:02:58.530 --> 00:03:09.780
 if the biggest character does not because it is the 

00:03:07.140 --> 00:03:15.390
 The work we do is independent. 

00:03:09.780 --> 00:03:18.500
 and villain or hero is the work that is 

00:03:15.390 --> 00:03:22.200
 everyday we have to do 

00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:26.160
 I like to make villains also have 

00:03:22.200 --> 00:03:29.540
 a gay to go out to work then the 

00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:29.540
 importer I think it's cool 

00:03:30.650 --> 00:03:38.670
 the series actually in the beginning I had 

00:03:35.670 --> 00:03:41.070
 I wanted my son to watch everything 

00:03:38.670 --> 00:03:48.690
 I really liked being a legend 

00:03:41.070 --> 00:03:51.090
 thing to find a little and then I went 

00:03:48.690 --> 00:03:53.220
 understanding better and such because 

00:03:51.090 --> 00:03:55.769
 initially we have a vision 

00:03:53.220 --> 00:03:58.410
 Shallow work, people do there. 

00:03:55.769 --> 00:04:01.080
 that part of the day and watch 

00:03:58.410 --> 00:04:04.230
 difficult but in knights with 

00:04:01.080 --> 00:04:06.780
 a special one in their understanding the 

00:04:04.230 --> 00:04:12.209
 more in the world of work 20 and has 

00:04:06.780 --> 00:04:14.130
 a philosophy so nothing changes the fact 

00:04:12.209 --> 00:04:15.140
 do not be continue being stay and 

00:04:14.130 --> 00:04:20.060
 keep doing 

00:04:15.140 --> 00:04:22.880
 the scent of professionalism that 

00:04:20.060 --> 00:04:24.890
 requires a work of connected people 

00:04:22.880 --> 00:04:25.520
 We're closing here to put a 

00:04:24.890 --> 00:04:28.160
 pop 

00:04:25.520 --> 00:04:30.980
