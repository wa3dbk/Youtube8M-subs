 effect tables one cup get to 

00:01:32.370 --> 00:01:36.630
 the fifth round will improve goalkeeping coach 

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:38.190
 and then extend the contract with a circus like 

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:41.640
 at least three years is clear and the contract 

00:01:38.190 --> 00:01:43.110
 watch for contracts that killed right away 

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:45.330
 I want to emphasize the game that I play on 

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:48.270
 the hardest level star can even 

00:01:45.330 --> 00:01:57.600
 now show it now just find 

00:01:48.270 --> 00:02:00.750
 where the taste is shorter, so show 

00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:03.240

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:04.860

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:07.740
 someone there win contract how 

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:10.380
 at least three years he and potter said 

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:15.900
 so we extend his contract just 

00:02:10.380 --> 00:02:20.220
 for three years so make an offer so 

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:24.000
 we all knocked down one task 

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:27.510
 have already completed the task will look here 

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:30.530
 here you see a tick 

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:34.290
 but better than your 3 m and then already done 

00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:36.269
 let's play first first 

00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:37.170
 friendly match doing some hands 

00:02:36.269 --> 00:02:43.370
 up 

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:43.370
 penalty free kick given to that 

00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:54.140
 discount Eric breaks no it turns out 

00:02:49.300 --> 00:02:57.849
 corner feed head 

00:02:54.140 --> 00:03:00.950
 and what mind 

00:02:57.849 --> 00:03:03.350
 all see replay hit rick but 

00:03:00.950 --> 00:03:08.830
 clearly got up and then we 

00:03:03.350 --> 00:03:08.830
 it turned out that we punched the head 

00:03:10.450 --> 00:03:21.019
 corner so here so ball dad 

00:03:17.269 --> 00:03:24.140
 fall into my head 

00:03:21.019 --> 00:03:26.450
 beats in years in the right that is the bottom corner 

00:03:24.140 --> 00:03:30.920
 protection does not protect the ball and return 

00:03:26.450 --> 00:03:34.519
 lapel and finishes my striker so y 

00:03:30.920 --> 00:03:36.019
 goes to attack in the selection in pressure so 

00:03:34.519 --> 00:03:39.410
 now at this very dangerous moment 

00:03:36.019 --> 00:03:41.900
 water gate but now could be very 

00:03:39.410 --> 00:03:47.680
 dangerous full opponent missed 

00:03:41.900 --> 00:03:47.680
 so there was no danger 

00:03:52.500 --> 00:03:59.550
 do you pass well there raised a hand could 

00:03:56.490 --> 00:04:03.750
 here and so do the filing filing og not 

00:03:59.550 --> 00:04:12.840
 turned canvas 

00:04:03.750 --> 00:04:17.900
 question so gets the ball to drag and no 

00:04:12.840 --> 00:04:17.900
 I can't do it okay 

00:04:26.550 --> 00:04:31.110
 so very dangerous not to break off 

00:04:28.590 --> 00:04:31.440
 now score so if my var turn 

00:04:31.110 --> 00:04:34.610
 will come out 

00:04:31.440 --> 00:04:36.930
 points good good rotary ok 

00:04:34.610 --> 00:04:38.819
 all protect could not hold back 

00:04:36.930 --> 00:04:41.430
 single striker at the gate could 

00:04:38.819 --> 00:04:42.139
 deal with it not blow so where 

00:04:41.430 --> 00:04:46.889
 in return 

00:04:42.139 --> 00:04:48.930
 a team of rivals now see how 

00:04:46.889 --> 00:04:52.710
 they fall corner this is a good interception 

00:04:48.930 --> 00:04:55.849
 What we are now a good interception in 

00:04:52.710 --> 00:04:58.889
 outweigh the dance failed oh 

00:04:55.849 --> 00:05:03.680
 so now I still have a chance to score no 

00:04:58.889 --> 00:05:07.050
 it does not work oh that's all right so 

00:05:03.680 --> 00:05:14.599
 oh so no got all good all 

00:05:07.050 --> 00:05:14.599
 okay, so I do under no, I do the flow 

00:05:15.169 --> 00:05:20.460
 Now may be a dangerous counter attack in 

00:05:18.199 --> 00:05:23.460
 rivals seem to be still yellow 

00:05:20.460 --> 00:05:23.940
 card gives my red card 

00:05:23.460 --> 00:05:27.150
 slide 

00:05:23.940 --> 00:05:31.639

00:05:27.150 --> 00:05:37.860
 accidentally hit up during the show and 

00:05:31.639 --> 00:05:41.370

00:05:54.690 --> 00:05:59.270
