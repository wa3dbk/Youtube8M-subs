00:00:08.769 --> 00:00:13.929
 hi everyone how are they going out and that there 

00:00:10.749 --> 00:00:16.299
 let's prepare the rich herick yesterday and 

00:00:13.929 --> 00:00:21.340
 these are the ingredients 

00:00:16.299 --> 00:00:24.070
 We will occupy 3 eggs a slice of cinnamon 2 

00:00:21.340 --> 00:00:28.000
 cups of milk or what would be medium 

00:00:24.070 --> 00:00:30.970
 liter half cup of sugar those are the 

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:34.300
 ingredients and what we will occupy will be a 

00:00:30.970 --> 00:00:37.600
 refractory or tray and apart they will be 

00:00:34.300 --> 00:00:41.559
 ways the first thing we're going to do is 

00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:43.060
 boil the milk together with the 

00:00:41.559 --> 00:00:46.660
 cinnamon 

00:00:43.060 --> 00:00:49.630
 Here I put cinnamon milk on fire 

00:00:46.660 --> 00:00:52.150
 and also the sugar we will wait for 

00:00:49.630 --> 00:00:55.420
 let it boil and then we're going to 

00:00:52.150 --> 00:00:58.690
 book here is not boiling we're going 

00:00:55.420 --> 00:01:01.330
 to let about 2 minutes to boil and 

00:00:58.690 --> 00:01:03.040
 constant a little cinnamon remember 

00:01:01.330 --> 00:01:05.470
 that here we have in milk the 

00:01:03.040 --> 00:01:07.450
 cinnamon and blue or milk along with 

00:01:05.470 --> 00:01:09.550
 the eggs let it cool a bit 

00:01:07.450 --> 00:01:11.510
 milk so they do not cook there 

00:01:09.550 --> 00:01:13.610
 the eggs 

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:16.010
 and here is the milk now what I'm going to 

00:01:13.610 --> 00:01:17.630
 to do is add the eggs and I'll go 

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:20.420
 to liquefy 

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:22.939
 I already liquefy it here but at the time of 

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:24.829
 liquefy made them like a lot of foam I'm going to 

00:01:22.939 --> 00:01:27.950
 wait about two minutes for it to 

00:01:24.829 --> 00:01:30.920
 rebate while I already put here the 

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:33.770
 flaneras to the container that I have here 

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:35.600
 I already put water on it and I 'm not going to 

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:37.700
 empty here I'm going to empty 

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:39.770
 approximately up to the line that you see 

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:43.189
 here on the planet has to be three 

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:46.189
 I also learned the oven 

00:01:43.189 --> 00:01:49.130
 for like 15 minutes so that already 

00:01:46.189 --> 00:01:52.599
 be hot when it comes to 

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:54.530
 introduce our our preparation 

00:01:52.599 --> 00:01:56.689
 then let's wait for about two 

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:59.149
 minutes for the foam to come down and 

00:01:56.689 --> 00:02:01.670
 right away we are going to serve you here already under 

00:01:59.149 --> 00:02:04.909
 TV then now let's 

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:08.700
 to do is let's serve there with care 

00:02:04.909 --> 00:02:11.069
 and I for watching here I see it here 

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:15.000
 then we will leave it like this three 

00:02:11.069 --> 00:02:17.910
 rooms so here I got a little cup of 

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:20.660
 glass to be able to finish the 

00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:24.269
 preparation then how can I not with 

00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:27.230
 the bed to record I'm not going to this one to put 

00:02:24.269 --> 00:02:30.780
 baked here are we going to let them 

00:02:27.230 --> 00:02:33.239
 about an hour for it to be 

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:35.970
 the preparation already when we see that it 

00:02:33.239 --> 00:02:38.580
 begins to form a little can of it is 

00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:40.410
 when they are already while we leave it as 

00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:43.650
 one hour approximately checking that 

00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:47.459
 have water here we have the jÃ©rica already 

00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:50.300
 the nasa that after more or less a 

00:02:47.459 --> 00:02:54.140
 hour and half 

00:02:50.300 --> 00:02:58.550
 here is the more you have this color 

00:02:54.140 --> 00:03:00.800
 more tasty will know as well as come here 

00:02:58.550 --> 00:03:05.420
 so I would have liked to have the 

00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:08.720
 but this one could not be done but 

00:03:05.420 --> 00:03:11.420
 be rich and so nothing else is already 

00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:14.120
 to serve we wait for them to cool and 

00:03:11.420 --> 00:03:18.080
 we put them in the refrigerator so that 

00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:21.530
 cool and so you can taste more 

00:03:18.080 --> 00:03:22.910
 good, I hope you liked it 

00:03:21.530 --> 00:03:25.420

00:03:22.910 --> 00:03:25.420
