00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:30.300
 maybe you think that none of this has anything to do with you 

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:32.200
 maybe he gave him the pib 

00:00:32.200 --> 00:00:33.730
 is the nature 

00:00:33.730 --> 00:00:37.320
 maybe when I hear is the term global warming you think about 

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:41.270
 sci-fi movies in radical environmental groups or worse yet 

00:00:42.430 --> 00:00:45.430
 many years for them to become reality 

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:48.700
 maybe they are already recovering 

00:00:48.700 --> 00:00:50.429
 this is our planet 

00:00:50.429 --> 00:00:53.470
 the layer that surrounds it is the atmosphere 

00:00:53.470 --> 00:00:55.829
 is catching some of the sun's rays 

00:00:55.829 --> 00:00:59.780
 and keep them inside the planet to maintain a temperature of 15 degrees 

00:00:59.780 --> 00:01:00.970
 centigrade 

00:01:00.970 --> 00:01:05.310
 otherwise the sun's rays would escape and our planet would fall 

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:08.440
 at a temperature of -18 degrees Celsius 

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:13.770
 this is known as the greenhouse effect and is effected by gases such as steam from 

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:17.910
 water the carbon dioxide the Mexican and others in a proper proportion 

00:01:17.910 --> 00:01:21.360
 Greenhouse gases fulfill their purpose 

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:26.370
 but you and increase your concentration the sun's rays can not escape and the 

00:01:26.370 --> 00:01:30.960
 planet's temperature rises with repercussions parties forums 

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:36.150
 this is the concentration of carbon dioxide and global average temperature of 

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:38.120
 the last 30 years 

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:41.950
 and this is the level of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere currently 

00:01:41.950 --> 00:01:44.610
 while some relation 

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:47.940
 because they increase greenhouse gases there are three factors 

00:01:47.940 --> 00:01:49.310
 fundamental 

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:51.800
 the burning of fossil fuels 

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:56.560
 the destruction of forests that absorb carbon dioxide and the increase of 

00:01:56.560 --> 00:01:59.540
 the population when it is a vicious circle 

00:01:59.540 --> 00:02:03.540
 the population of the world increases rapidly, which is a 

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:06.540
 greater demand for food, water and natural resources 

00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:11.430
 the trees absorb a large percentage of the dioxide emanations 

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:15.920
 carbon but we are currently destroying our forests and jungles 

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:19.820
 the lungs of our planet to meet the demands that lead us 

00:02:19.819 --> 00:02:22.869
 to the third point of the vicious circle 

00:02:22.869 --> 00:02:24.549
 obsolete technologies 

00:02:24.549 --> 00:02:28.739
 the human being still uses coal-based plants to generate energy 

00:02:28.739 --> 00:02:33.760
 this translates into 2 thousand 500 million tons of carbon dioxide per year 

00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:37.159
 that the excessive use of the automobile they generate is expelled into the environment 

00:02:37.819 --> 00:02:41.509
 hundreds of millions of tons of carbon dioxide that are going away 

00:02:41.509 --> 00:02:46.019
 Hector says what consequences global warming brings 

00:02:46.939 --> 00:02:50.859
 as more sun rays are trapped the temperature of the planet 

00:02:50.859 --> 00:02:54.519
 increase this causes even take out shortage of water for fires 

00:02:56.639 --> 00:03:00.409
 paradoxically, global warming also proposed rains that 

00:03:00.409 --> 00:03:03.429
 more severe floods 

00:03:03.429 --> 00:03:07.199
 the sun's rays increase the temperature of the oceans this causes 

00:03:07.199 --> 00:03:10.199
 greater evaporation and more severe rainfall 

00:03:10.799 --> 00:03:14.709
 but also when a hurricane comes into contact with warmer waters 

00:03:15.329 --> 00:03:18.409
 the worst happens 

00:03:18.409 --> 00:03:21.799
 with the temperature also occasions that the villages are thawed 

00:03:21.799 --> 00:03:26.170
 and as a result more calm fresh water this raises the level of 

00:03:26.169 --> 00:03:28.829
 oceans causing severe floods 

00:03:28.829 --> 00:03:33.980
 the problem is serious if the sea level will rise 6 meters it would happen with places 

00:03:33.979 --> 00:03:36.979
 like a flower and song in san francisco holland 

00:03:36.979 --> 00:03:41.619
 beijing shanghai a bangladesh calendar and in mexico some 

00:03:41.619 --> 00:03:44.619
 bruises in veracruz tabasco campeche 

00:03:45.649 --> 00:03:47.289
 you can feel in your own flesh 

00:03:47.289 --> 00:03:51.119
 you can keep thinking there is still time to change but that is not true 

00:03:51.119 --> 00:03:55.719
 we have to start acting now here are some simple points that you can 

00:03:55.719 --> 00:03:57.939
 adopt to help the planet 

00:03:57.939 --> 00:04:00.459
 buy energy-saving lights 

00:04:00.459 --> 00:04:03.749
 turn off electrical appliances instead of leaving them on hold 

00:04:04.299 --> 00:04:07.789
 reduces the consumption of heaters and air conditioning 

00:04:07.789 --> 00:04:11.829
 if you can buy a hybrid car with an electric motor or a 

00:04:11.829 --> 00:04:14.619
 percentage of 17 kilometers per liter 

00:04:14.619 --> 00:04:18.959
 keep the tires of your car well inflated share the car 

00:04:19.979 --> 00:04:22.559
 road bicycle 

00:04:22.559 --> 00:04:28.229
 use less hot water when failing wash clothes with cold water recycle hatch 

00:04:28.229 --> 00:04:29.990
 separate trash 

00:04:29.990 --> 00:04:33.279
 plant a tree 

00:04:33.279 --> 00:04:37.869
 We are finishing the planet this wonderful world that makes us so much 

00:04:37.869 --> 00:04:42.599
 we are still on time but we have to change our way of thinking and 

00:04:42.599 --> 00:04:44.529
 start acting now
