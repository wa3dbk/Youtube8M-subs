do it it's going to be quite fiddly so

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:29.779 
do it it's going to be quite fiddly so
the<00:00:28.170> zip<00:00:28.349> is<00:00:28.410> going<00:00:28.560> to<00:00:28.650> sit<00:00:28.800> like<00:00:28.830> this<00:00:28.980> it's

between the crocheted part and the

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:42.799 
between the crocheted part and the
actual<00:00:39.000> key<00:00:39.989> for<00:00:40.200> the<00:00:40.290> zip<00:00:41.360> so<00:00:42.360> what<00:00:42.629> you<00:00:42.690> can

00:01:35.109 --> 00:01:40.649 
the right place you have to line up both
sides<00:01:36.509> so<00:01:37.509> those<00:01:37.960> bits<00:01:38.259> line<00:01:39.069> up<00:01:39.250> and<00:01:39.659> we're

00:01:40.649 --> 00:01:40.659 
sides so those bits line up and we're

00:01:40.659 --> 00:01:41.789 
sides so those bits line up and we're
just<00:01:40.689> going<00:01:40.929> to<00:01:40.959> do<00:01:41.079> a<00:01:41.109> couple<00:01:41.439> of<00:01:41.590> stitches

00:01:48.859 --> 00:01:48.869 

00:01:48.869 --> 00:01:51.200 

so<00:01:49.500> you<00:01:49.590> just<00:01:49.859> need<00:01:50.070> about<00:01:50.820> two<00:01:51.060> or<00:01:51.149> three

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:51.210 
so you just need about two or three

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:55.130 
so you just need about two or three
would<00:01:51.509> you<00:01:52.219> doesn't<00:01:53.219> need<00:01:53.280> to<00:01:53.399> be<00:01:53.810> like<00:01:54.810> really

00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:55.140 
would you doesn't need to be like really

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:57.999 
would you doesn't need to be like really
tight<00:01:55.500> in<00:01:55.649> place<00:01:55.829> but<00:01:56.159> as<00:01:56.310> long<00:01:56.460> as<00:01:56.579> this

00:01:57.999 --> 00:01:58.009 
tight in place but as long as this

00:01:58.009 --> 00:02:04.760 
tight in place but as long as this
doesn't<00:01:59.009> air<00:01:59.670> move<00:02:00.299> around<00:02:00.509> a<00:02:00.659> lot<00:02:03.500> like<00:02:04.500> I<00:02:04.619> say

00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:04.770 
doesn't air move around a lot like I say

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:06.649 
doesn't air move around a lot like I say
just<00:02:04.950> do<00:02:05.069> some<00:02:05.250> stitches<00:02:05.670> and<00:02:05.880> then<00:02:06.060> we<00:02:06.450> can

00:02:06.649 --> 00:02:06.659 
just do some stitches and then we can

00:02:06.659 --> 00:02:10.669 
just do some stitches and then we can
stitch<00:02:07.560> the<00:02:07.890> other<00:02:08.009> side<00:02:08.250> to<00:02:08.549> the<00:02:08.670> zip<00:02:09.619> okay<00:02:10.619> so

00:02:10.669 --> 00:02:10.679 
stitch the other side to the zip okay so

00:02:10.679 --> 00:02:12.259 
stitch the other side to the zip okay so
once<00:02:10.860> you've<00:02:10.950> done<00:02:11.069> those<00:02:11.160> two<00:02:11.370> stitches<00:02:11.910> so

00:02:12.259 --> 00:02:12.269 
once you've done those two stitches so

00:02:12.269 --> 00:02:14.869 
once you've done those two stitches so
you<00:02:12.330> know<00:02:12.480> where<00:02:12.720> to<00:02:13.560> start<00:02:13.799> it<00:02:14.040> you<00:02:14.700> can<00:02:14.849> then

00:02:14.869 --> 00:02:14.879 
you know where to start it you can then

00:02:14.879 --> 00:02:17.119 
you know where to start it you can then
open<00:02:15.450> the<00:02:15.510> zip<00:02:15.720> and<00:02:16.349> it<00:02:16.440> makes<00:02:16.650> it<00:02:16.769> easier<00:02:17.069> to

00:02:17.119 --> 00:02:17.129 
open the zip and it makes it easier to

00:02:17.129 --> 00:02:20.449 
open the zip and it makes it easier to
stitch<00:02:17.459> on<00:02:17.730> this<00:02:18.150> side<00:02:19.069> so<00:02:20.069> again<00:02:20.099> you<00:02:20.370> just

00:02:20.449 --> 00:02:20.459 
stitch on this side so again you just

00:02:20.459 --> 00:02:26.170 
stitch on this side so again you just
line<00:02:20.700> it<00:02:20.730> up<00:02:20.849> and<00:02:22.340> stitch<00:02:23.340> across<00:02:24.140> the<00:02:25.140> zip

00:02:26.170 --> 00:02:26.180 
line it up and stitch across the zip

00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:29.870 
line it up and stitch across the zip
again<00:02:27.180> just<00:02:27.630> a<00:02:27.690> simple<00:02:28.019> stitch<00:02:28.760> once<00:02:29.760> you're

00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:29.880 
again just a simple stitch once you're

00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:32.470 
again just a simple stitch once you're
finished<00:02:29.970> you<00:02:30.180> look<00:02:30.390> like<00:02:30.540> this<00:02:30.690> and<00:02:31.319> you<00:02:31.380> can

00:02:32.470 --> 00:02:32.480 
finished you look like this and you can

00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:36.979 
finished you look like this and you can
zip<00:02:33.480> up<00:02:33.690> and<00:02:35.269> you<00:02:36.269> might<00:02:36.420> have<00:02:36.599> a<00:02:36.629> bit<00:02:36.900> of

00:02:36.979 --> 00:02:36.989 
zip up and you might have a bit of

00:02:36.989 --> 00:02:39.530 
zip up and you might have a bit of
excess<00:02:37.290> zip<00:02:37.560> a<00:02:37.829> little<00:02:38.430> bits<00:02:38.610> fine<00:02:38.940> if<00:02:39.480> you

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:39.540 
excess zip a little bits fine if you

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:41.690 
excess zip a little bits fine if you
don't<00:02:39.629> want<00:02:39.780> too<00:02:39.900> much<00:02:40.079> so<00:02:40.379> you<00:02:40.440> can<00:02:40.620> just<00:02:40.799> get

00:02:41.690 --> 00:02:41.700 
don't want too much so you can just get

00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:45.680 
don't want too much so you can just get
processors<00:02:42.299> and<00:02:42.510> chop<00:02:42.900> that<00:02:43.019> down<00:02:44.510> on<00:02:45.510> both

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:45.690 
processors and chop that down on both

00:02:45.690 --> 00:02:49.280 
processors and chop that down on both
ends<00:02:45.930> so<00:02:47.510> now<00:02:48.510> it's<00:02:48.629> hard<00:02:48.780> to<00:02:48.900> get<00:02:49.049> like<00:02:49.140> the

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:49.290 
ends so now it's hard to get like the

00:02:49.290 --> 00:02:51.170 
ends so now it's hard to get like the
really<00:02:49.470> tiny<00:02:49.680> sips<00:02:50.010> so<00:02:50.430> chances<00:02:50.819> are<00:02:50.940> you<00:02:51.060> can

00:02:51.170 --> 00:02:51.180 
really tiny sips so chances are you can

00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:55.930 
really tiny sips so chances are you can
have<00:02:51.329> some<00:02:51.540> zip<00:02:52.319> that<00:02:52.500> you<00:02:52.560> want<00:02:52.709> to<00:02:52.769> call

00:02:55.930 --> 00:02:55.940 

00:02:55.940 --> 00:02:58.150 

okay<00:02:56.420> so<00:02:56.510> now<00:02:56.660> the<00:02:56.720> only<00:02:56.930> thing<00:02:57.170> left<00:02:57.590> to<00:02:57.740> do<00:02:57.920> is

00:02:58.150 --> 00:02:58.160 
okay so now the only thing left to do is

00:02:58.160 --> 00:03:00.340 
okay so now the only thing left to do is
to<00:02:58.850> sew<00:02:59.390> the<00:02:59.540> wrist<00:02:59.690> fit<00:02:59.870> together

00:03:00.340 --> 00:03:00.350 
to sew the wrist fit together

00:03:00.350 --> 00:03:02.440 
to sew the wrist fit together
so<00:03:01.250> again<00:03:01.490> you're<00:03:01.640> going<00:03:01.730> to<00:03:01.790> attach<00:03:02.120> some

00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:02.450 
so again you're going to attach some

00:03:02.450 --> 00:03:06.450 
so again you're going to attach some
more<00:03:02.600> thread<00:03:02.810> to<00:03:03.050> the<00:03:03.920> end<00:03:04.100> one<00:03:04.460> of<00:03:04.490> the<00:03:04.640> zips

00:03:06.450 --> 00:03:06.460 
more thread to the end one of the zips

00:03:06.460 --> 00:03:08.980 
more thread to the end one of the zips
this<00:03:07.460> is<00:03:07.580> just<00:03:07.790> so<00:03:07.940> the<00:03:08.150> end<00:03:08.660> of<00:03:08.720> the<00:03:08.780> phrase

00:03:08.980 --> 00:03:08.990 
this is just so the end of the phrase

00:03:08.990 --> 00:03:11.610 
this is just so the end of the phrase
hidden

00:03:11.610 --> 00:03:11.620 

00:03:11.620 --> 00:03:15.030 

and<00:03:11.800> we're<00:03:12.459> going<00:03:12.580> to<00:03:12.610> line<00:03:12.790> it<00:03:12.819> up<00:03:13.800> I'm<00:03:14.800> going

00:03:15.030 --> 00:03:15.040 
and we're going to line it up I'm going

00:03:15.040 --> 00:03:16.559 
and we're going to line it up I'm going
to<00:03:15.099> get<00:03:15.220> the<00:03:15.310> thread<00:03:15.550> on<00:03:15.670> the<00:03:15.790> outside<00:03:16.120> let's

00:03:16.559 --> 00:03:16.569 
to get the thread on the outside let's

00:03:16.569 --> 00:03:20.280 
to get the thread on the outside let's
start<00:03:16.780> off<00:03:16.870> if<00:03:17.050> and<00:03:18.780> we're<00:03:19.780> just<00:03:19.870> going<00:03:20.110> to<00:03:20.170> do

00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:20.290 
start off if and we're just going to do

00:03:20.290 --> 00:03:23.130 
start off if and we're just going to do
a<00:03:20.739> simple<00:03:21.730> stitch<00:03:21.910> again<00:03:22.180> with<00:03:22.810> simple

00:03:23.130 --> 00:03:23.140 
a simple stitch again with simple

00:03:23.140 --> 00:03:25.770 
a simple stitch again with simple
stitches<00:03:23.440> just<00:03:23.730> going<00:03:24.730> in<00:03:24.879> and<00:03:25.030> out<00:03:25.090> of<00:03:25.420> each

00:03:25.770 --> 00:03:25.780 
stitches just going in and out of each

00:03:25.780 --> 00:03:31.410 
stitches just going in and out of each
side<00:03:26.050> of<00:03:26.379> the<00:03:27.310> purse

00:03:31.410 --> 00:03:31.420 

00:03:31.420 --> 00:03:34.890 

so<00:03:32.050> we<00:03:32.230> just<00:03:32.380> do<00:03:32.590> that<00:03:33.540> all<00:03:34.540> the<00:03:34.600> way<00:03:34.750> around

00:03:34.890 --> 00:03:34.900 
so we just do that all the way around

00:03:34.900 --> 00:03:37.350 
so we just do that all the way around
this<00:03:35.230> side<00:03:35.470> of<00:03:36.340> the<00:03:36.520> person<00:03:37.000> till<00:03:37.150> you<00:03:37.240> get

00:03:37.350 --> 00:03:37.360 
this side of the person till you get

00:03:37.360 --> 00:03:41.550 
this side of the person till you get
round<00:03:37.569> to<00:03:38.380> the<00:03:38.500> other<00:03:38.530> end<00:03:38.830> of<00:03:38.920> the<00:03:39.040> zip<00:03:40.560> this

00:03:41.550 --> 00:03:41.560 
round to the other end of the zip this

00:03:41.560 --> 00:03:44.340 
round to the other end of the zip this
once<00:03:41.830> you<00:03:41.920> get<00:03:42.040> to<00:03:42.160> there<00:03:42.480> again<00:03:43.480> just<00:03:43.990> have<00:03:44.200> to

00:03:44.340 --> 00:03:44.350 
once you get to there again just have to

00:03:44.350 --> 00:03:48.350 
once you get to there again just have to
tie<00:03:44.590> it<00:03:44.650> off<00:03:46.530> so<00:03:47.530> you<00:03:47.590> make<00:03:47.770> a<00:03:47.800> little<00:03:47.950> stitch

00:03:48.350 --> 00:03:48.360 
tie it off so you make a little stitch

00:03:48.360 --> 00:03:50.760 
tie it off so you make a little stitch
if<00:03:49.360> we<00:03:49.540> put<00:03:49.780> it<00:03:49.840> the<00:03:49.990> whole<00:03:50.140> way<00:03:50.290> through

00:03:50.760 --> 00:03:50.770 
if we put it the whole way through

00:03:50.770 --> 00:03:53.699 
if we put it the whole way through
you<00:03:51.310> take<00:03:51.550> the<00:03:51.700> needle<00:03:52.320> and<00:03:53.320> put<00:03:53.530> it<00:03:53.560> through

00:03:53.699 --> 00:03:53.709 
you take the needle and put it through

00:03:53.709 --> 00:03:57.300 
you take the needle and put it through
the<00:03:53.800> end<00:03:53.980> loop<00:03:54.630> and<00:03:55.630> pull<00:03:55.840> it<00:03:55.959> tight<00:03:56.310> again

00:03:57.300 --> 00:03:57.310 
the end loop and pull it tight again

00:03:57.310 --> 00:04:01.590 
the end loop and pull it tight again
just<00:03:57.520> do<00:03:57.610> a<00:03:57.640> couple<00:03:57.820> of<00:03:58.000> these<00:03:58.120> nuts<00:04:00.480> always<00:04:01.480> do

00:04:01.590 --> 00:04:01.600 
just do a couple of these nuts always do

00:04:01.600 --> 00:04:03.090 
just do a couple of these nuts always do
a<00:04:01.630> couple<00:04:01.930> just<00:04:02.050> to<00:04:02.140> make<00:04:02.290> sure<00:04:02.319> because<00:04:02.709> I<00:04:03.010> do

00:04:03.090 --> 00:04:03.100 
a couple just to make sure because I do

00:04:03.100 --> 00:04:07.170 
a couple just to make sure because I do
want<00:04:03.250> anything<00:04:03.640> common<00:04:04.180> loosed<00:04:05.160> and<00:04:06.160> then<00:04:06.670> we

00:04:07.170 --> 00:04:07.180 
want anything common loosed and then we

00:04:07.180 --> 00:04:11.340 
want anything common loosed and then we
just<00:04:07.420> hide<00:04:07.870> the<00:04:08.290> thread<00:04:08.580> by<00:04:10.260> leaving<00:04:11.260> it

00:04:11.340 --> 00:04:11.350 
just hide the thread by leaving it

00:04:11.350 --> 00:04:14.640 
just hide the thread by leaving it
through<00:04:12.010> some<00:04:12.340> of<00:04:12.400> the<00:04:12.459> stitches<00:04:13.500> and<00:04:14.500> then

00:04:14.640 --> 00:04:14.650 
through some of the stitches and then

00:04:14.650 --> 00:04:20.370 
through some of the stitches and then
cutting<00:04:15.070> off<00:04:15.280> the<00:04:15.519> excess<00:04:19.049> so<00:04:20.049> we<00:04:20.140> just<00:04:20.290> do

00:04:20.370 --> 00:04:20.380 
cutting off the excess so we just do

00:04:20.380 --> 00:04:22.620 
cutting off the excess so we just do
that<00:04:20.530> and<00:04:20.880> now<00:04:21.880> it's<00:04:22.030> going<00:04:22.180> to<00:04:22.210> be<00:04:22.300> a<00:04:22.330> bit<00:04:22.480> of<00:04:22.570> a

00:04:22.620 --> 00:04:22.630 
that and now it's going to be a bit of a

00:04:22.630 --> 00:04:24.780 
that and now it's going to be a bit of a
funky<00:04:23.320> shape<00:04:23.560> so<00:04:23.890> what<00:04:24.160> we<00:04:24.220> have<00:04:24.340> to<00:04:24.430> do<00:04:24.550> is

00:04:24.780 --> 00:04:24.790 
funky shape so what we have to do is

00:04:24.790 --> 00:04:30.659 
funky shape so what we have to do is
open<00:04:25.210> it<00:04:25.270> up<00:04:26.280> so<00:04:27.280> unzip<00:04:27.730> it<00:04:27.910> and<00:04:29.640> we're<00:04:30.640> just

00:04:30.659 --> 00:04:30.669 
open it up so unzip it and we're just

00:04:30.669 --> 00:04:36.930 
open it up so unzip it and we're just
going<00:04:30.970> to<00:04:31.260> stretch<00:04:32.260> it<00:04:32.440> out<00:04:32.500> a<00:04:32.560> bit<00:04:34.590> so<00:04:35.590> it<00:04:36.580> all

00:04:36.930 --> 00:04:36.940 
going to stretch it out a bit so it all

00:04:36.940 --> 00:04:39.000 
going to stretch it out a bit so it all
flattens<00:04:37.330> out<00:04:37.500> this<00:04:38.500> is<00:04:38.650> what<00:04:38.770> it<00:04:38.860> should<00:04:38.950> look

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:39.010 
flattens out this is what it should look
