00:00:01.489 --> 00:00:04.650
 I came in a plastic bottle 

00:00:04.650 --> 00:00:05.680
 from now on 

00:00:05.680 --> 00:00:07.020
 Compost appearance- 

00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:10.379
 It is a state of inside 

00:00:10.379 --> 00:00:13.849
 What you can see in front is the control panel of the compost bird 

00:00:13.849 --> 00:00:16.849
 We now have 

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:27.369
 ltd. 

00:00:27.369 --> 00:00:28.480
 Display method 

00:00:28.480 --> 00:00:30.199
 I think I can see 

00:00:30.199 --> 00:00:32.510
 The manufacturer finally hit 

00:00:32.510 --> 00:00:34.960
 Numbers are lined up 

00:00:34.960 --> 00:00:37.960
 This is the setting temperature of Hibari hill heater 

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:40.350
 everyone is 

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:41.960
 Wintering 

00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:43.790
 That earlier 

00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:47.170
 Explained finally issued in that 

00:00:47.170 --> 00:00:50.170
 I'm trying to get out of the temperature sensor 

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:52.710
 It is the temperature in the tank 

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:56.950
 Currently 22. I'm a little bit tired 

00:00:57.630 --> 00:00:59.270
 Each hail begins 

00:00:59.270 --> 00:01:01.240
 Finally 

00:01:01.240 --> 00:01:04.250
 If compost takes 

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:06.160
 This set temperature 

00:01:06.160 --> 00:01:09.090
 Rise to around 38 degrees 

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:13.190
 Also, because this changes with the issue button of 

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:14.490
 Unexpectedly 

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:17.490
 I will refuse only Yanai. 

00:01:18.690 --> 00:01:20.080
 44 degrees 

00:01:20.080 --> 00:01:21.480
 One from now 

00:01:21.480 --> 00:01:22.460
 During the period 

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:24.240
 It is at present 

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:25.750
 During the period 

00:01:25.750 --> 00:01:27.360
 45 degrees 

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:30.110
 It is the set temperature of the heater 

00:01:30.110 --> 00:01:33.150
 Functionally different when it comes to forty-five people 

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:36.690
 Also here 38 degrees 

00:01:36.690 --> 00:01:38.330
 In the main hall 

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:40.900
 Because it will be a day of natto 

00:01:40.900 --> 00:01:43.500
 It means that I always pulled in but did not enter 

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:46.500
 There is none 

00:01:47.580 --> 00:01:50.100
 Then here it is here 

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:53.230
 There is a green button even though this is not paying 

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:56.840
 I can secure the initiative of the event 

00:01:57.450 --> 00:02:00.910
 Now is the question 8 8 this time 8 

00:02:00.910 --> 00:02:04.630
 Automatic operation takes place at a rate of once every two and a half hours 

00:02:05.650 --> 00:02:09.960
 Discontinue nuclear disposal any time by pressing the seed button on this day 

00:02:09.960 --> 00:02:12.159
 can do 

00:02:12.159 --> 00:02:14.259
 Women are finally 

00:02:14.259 --> 00:02:15.909
 After use 

00:02:15.909 --> 00:02:18.319
 The second attack to something with Taruda 

00:02:18.319 --> 00:02:21.229
 Expected to be used 

00:02:21.229 --> 00:02:24.319
 And here-8 emergency stop devices 

00:02:25.729 --> 00:02:27.699
 This emergency stop button 

00:02:27.699 --> 00:02:30.559
 When you say something was dropped accidentally 

00:02:30.559 --> 00:02:32.069
 Use 

00:02:32.069 --> 00:02:35.069
 Especially when you are looking at expanding the sales channel 

00:02:35.679 --> 00:02:38.679
 It is a safety device that I think is effective 

00:02:46.549 --> 00:02:49.039
 From now on, it is delicious 

00:02:49.039 --> 00:02:52.039
 It is a place 

00:02:53.189 --> 00:02:56.189
 With what is used a common Western-style toilet 

00:02:56.729 --> 00:02:58.529
 Large ceiling picture 

00:02:58.529 --> 00:03:01.909
 No change 

00:03:01.909 --> 00:03:04.909
 Then we use prevention net 

00:03:07.709 --> 00:03:10.709
 So there is a big difference with flush toilets 

00:03:14.299 --> 00:03:16.899
 In this way, if you lose 

00:03:16.899 --> 00:03:18.979
 Traditional 

00:03:18.979 --> 00:03:21.979
 It is the wind of the cotton toilet 

00:03:23.569 --> 00:03:27.269
 This was that that composite / s-video was not able 

00:03:27.269 --> 00:03:28.459
 Because you can not 

00:03:28.459 --> 00:03:31.459
 In the form of long-term investment 

00:03:34.009 --> 00:03:36.929
 I explained earlier 

00:03:36.929 --> 00:03:40.079
 From the bench to 

00:03:40.079 --> 00:03:41.769
 There is air 

00:03:41.769 --> 00:03:44.769
 Branch 

00:03:45.989 --> 00:03:48.479
 Pet like this from the gap- 

00:03:48.479 --> 00:03:49.239
 Against 

00:03:49.239 --> 00:03:52.449
 New air placed in the fermenter 

00:03:52.449 --> 00:03:55.459
 And even in the fermenter to microbes 

00:03:56.099 --> 00:03:57.779
 Supply air 

00:03:57.779 --> 00:03:59.469
 outside 

00:03:59.469 --> 00:04:02.159
 It will be in the form of running away 

00:04:02.159 --> 00:04:05.039
 Because I have 130,000 on the outside 

00:04:05.039 --> 00:04:07.499
 The toilet has been broken 

00:04:07.499 --> 00:04:09.529
 I'm talking about that 

00:04:09.529 --> 00:04:12.529
 It is designed to be fed into the tank 

00:04:18.419 --> 00:04:23.090
 I think the above is easy but I will explain it outside the department 

00:04:23.090 --> 00:04:25.349
 Let me do it 

00:04:25.349 --> 00:04:28.020
 We hope for your reference 

00:04:28.020 --> 00:04:29.470
 Thank you
