00:04:00.140 --> 00:04:01.840 
side and backstage you need also act
like<00:04:00.290> a<00:04:00.350> kid<00:04:00.590> because<00:04:00.709> if<00:04:00.890> you<00:04:01.040> you<00:04:01.550> know<00:04:01.640> if

00:04:01.840 --> 00:04:01.850 
like a kid because if you you know if

00:04:01.850 --> 00:04:04.780 
like a kid because if you you know if
you<00:04:01.970> act<00:04:02.150> too<00:04:02.300> much<00:04:02.830> you<00:04:03.830> know<00:04:03.950> you<00:04:04.310> have<00:04:04.670> to

00:04:04.780 --> 00:04:04.790 
you act too much you know you have to

00:04:04.790 --> 00:04:06.430 
you act too much you know you have to
have<00:04:04.910> some<00:04:05.180> fun<00:04:05.450> and<00:04:05.630> that's<00:04:05.930> the<00:04:06.080> thing<00:04:06.260> it's

00:04:06.430 --> 00:04:06.440 
have some fun and that's the thing it's

00:04:06.440 --> 00:04:07.780 
have some fun and that's the thing it's
it's<00:04:06.620> having<00:04:06.920> fun<00:04:07.130> but<00:04:07.400> also<00:04:07.520> being

00:04:07.780 --> 00:04:07.790 
it's having fun but also being

00:04:07.790 --> 00:04:08.559 
it's having fun but also being
professional

00:04:08.559 --> 00:04:08.569 
professional

00:04:08.569 --> 00:04:10.929 
professional
so<00:04:09.260> I<00:04:09.290> think<00:04:09.650> that's<00:04:09.829> the<00:04:10.310> combination<00:04:10.909> of

00:04:10.929 --> 00:04:10.939 
so I think that's the combination of

00:04:10.939 --> 00:04:12.729 
so I think that's the combination of
that<00:04:11.180> would<00:04:11.420> be<00:04:11.450> just<00:04:11.719> it's<00:04:12.019> perfect

00:04:12.729 --> 00:04:12.739 
that would be just it's perfect

00:04:12.739 --> 00:04:14.470 
that would be just it's perfect
and<00:04:12.950> do<00:04:13.280> you<00:04:13.340> have<00:04:13.430> a<00:04:13.519> favorite<00:04:13.909> episode<00:04:14.000> of
