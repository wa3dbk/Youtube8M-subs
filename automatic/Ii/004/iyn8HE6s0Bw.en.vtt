I'm<00:03:13.340> not<00:03:13.550> sure<00:03:13.970> if<00:03:14.360> all<00:03:15.200> the<00:03:15.320> wraps<00:03:15.530> have<00:03:15.800> this

00:03:16.030 --> 00:03:16.040 
I'm not sure if all the wraps have this

00:03:16.040 --> 00:03:19.930 
I'm not sure if all the wraps have this
because<00:03:16.700> this<00:03:16.910> arena<00:03:17.180> didn't<00:03:17.540> have<00:03:17.720> it<00:03:17.930> um<00:03:18.940> I'm

00:03:19.930 --> 00:03:19.940 
because this arena didn't have it um I'm

00:03:19.940 --> 00:03:22.120 
because this arena didn't have it um I'm
much<00:03:20.209> I<00:03:20.480> think<00:03:20.570> the<00:03:21.560> one<00:03:21.739> where<00:03:21.890> you<00:03:22.010> on<00:03:22.100> the

00:03:22.120 --> 00:03:22.130 
much I think the one where you on the

00:03:22.130 --> 00:03:24.160 
much I think the one where you on the
little<00:03:22.700> bridge<00:03:22.940> where<00:03:23.420> Stryker<00:03:23.780> like

00:03:24.160 --> 00:03:24.170 
little bridge where Stryker like

00:03:24.170 --> 00:03:26.380 
little bridge where Stryker like
strikers<00:03:24.650> arena<00:03:25.070> that<00:03:25.310> one<00:03:25.550> it<00:03:25.970> removes<00:03:26.300> the

00:03:26.380 --> 00:03:26.390 
strikers arena that one it removes the

00:03:26.390 --> 00:03:28.630 
strikers arena that one it removes the
cars<00:03:26.630> I'm<00:03:26.810> pretty<00:03:26.989> sure<00:03:27.200> this<00:03:28.130> one<00:03:28.340> we<00:03:28.459> have

00:03:28.630 --> 00:03:28.640 
cars I'm pretty sure this one we have

00:03:28.640 --> 00:03:30.640 
cars I'm pretty sure this one we have
right<00:03:28.790> here<00:03:28.820> is<00:03:29.060> called<00:03:29.300> endless<00:03:29.540> combat<00:03:30.020> what

00:03:30.640 --> 00:03:30.650 
right here is called endless combat what

00:03:30.650 --> 00:03:34.150 
right here is called endless combat what
I<00:03:30.680> was<00:03:30.800> saying<00:03:30.950> before<00:03:31.070> um<00:03:32.530> both<00:03:33.530> guys<00:03:33.739> have<00:03:33.980> no

00:03:34.150 --> 00:03:34.160 
I was saying before um both guys have no

00:03:34.160 --> 00:03:36.820 
I was saying before um both guys have no
heads<00:03:34.540> it's<00:03:35.540> kind<00:03:35.750> of<00:03:35.780> funny<00:03:35.989> you<00:03:36.230> know<00:03:36.800> it's

00:03:36.820 --> 00:03:36.830 
heads it's kind of funny you know it's

00:03:36.830 --> 00:03:39.520 
heads it's kind of funny you know it's
just<00:03:37.130> it's<00:03:37.459> just<00:03:37.640> a<00:03:38.030> not<00:03:38.840> on<00:03:38.989> basically

00:03:39.520 --> 00:03:39.530 
just it's just a not on basically

00:03:39.530 --> 00:03:44.380 
just it's just a not on basically
doesn't<00:03:40.250> really<00:03:40.430> affect<00:03:40.730> the<00:03:40.850> game<00:03:41.030> our<00:03:43.390> next

00:03:44.380 --> 00:03:44.390 
doesn't really affect the game our next

00:03:44.390 --> 00:03:46.900 
doesn't really affect the game our next
one<00:03:44.480> is<00:03:44.660> health<00:03:44.989> recovery<00:03:45.290> so<00:03:46.160> basically<00:03:46.520> if

00:03:46.900 --> 00:03:46.910 
one is health recovery so basically if

00:03:46.910 --> 00:03:49.150 
one is health recovery so basically if
you<00:03:46.940> got<00:03:47.239> hit<00:03:47.480> your<00:03:47.720> health<00:03:47.959> will<00:03:48.200> gradually

00:03:49.150 --> 00:03:49.160 
you got hit your health will gradually

00:03:49.160 --> 00:03:53.590 
you got hit your health will gradually
go<00:03:50.090> up<00:03:50.120> slowly<00:03:50.660> ah<00:03:51.110> it's<00:03:51.950> not<00:03:52.160> a<00:03:52.370> big<00:03:52.940> game

00:03:53.590 --> 00:03:53.600 
go up slowly ah it's not a big game

00:03:53.600 --> 00:03:55.180 
go up slowly ah it's not a big game
difference<00:03:54.020> but<00:03:54.170> if<00:03:54.320> you're<00:03:54.560> if<00:03:55.010> you're

00:03:55.180 --> 00:03:55.190 
difference but if you're if you're

00:03:55.190 --> 00:03:57.610 
difference but if you're if you're
camping<00:03:55.790> and<00:03:55.970> blocking<00:03:56.390> like<00:03:56.540> that<00:03:56.720> it<00:03:57.320> is

00:03:57.610 --> 00:03:57.620 
camping and blocking like that it is

00:03:57.620 --> 00:03:58.900 
camping and blocking like that it is
going<00:03:57.800> to<00:03:57.890> affect<00:03:58.160> you<00:03:58.310> it's<00:03:58.520> not<00:03:58.610> going<00:03:58.820> to

00:03:58.900 --> 00:03:58.910 
going to affect you it's not going to

00:03:58.910 --> 00:04:01.780 
going to affect you it's not going to
run<00:03:59.480> around<00:03:59.570> that<00:03:59.870> easily<00:04:00.550> next<00:04:01.550> one<00:04:01.640> we<00:04:01.760> have

00:04:01.780 --> 00:04:01.790 
run around that easily next one we have

00:04:01.790 --> 00:04:03.910 
run around that easily next one we have
is<00:04:01.940> hyper<00:04:02.270> fighting<00:04:02.570> which<00:04:03.410> speeds<00:04:03.739> up<00:04:03.860> the

00:04:03.910 --> 00:04:03.920 
is hyper fighting which speeds up the

00:04:03.920 --> 00:04:07.600 
is hyper fighting which speeds up the
game<00:04:04.190> I<00:04:04.750> think<00:04:05.750> by<00:04:06.530> three<00:04:06.890> times<00:04:07.190> the<00:04:07.489> normal

00:04:07.600 --> 00:04:07.610 
game I think by three times the normal

00:04:07.610 --> 00:04:10.780 
game I think by three times the normal
speed<00:04:07.970> and<00:04:08.890> even<00:04:09.890> though<00:04:09.980> the<00:04:10.340> announcers

00:04:10.780 --> 00:04:10.790 
speed and even though the announcers

00:04:10.790 --> 00:04:14.770 
speed and even though the announcers

faster<00:04:18.320> to<00:04:18.609> invisible<00:04:19.609> combat<00:04:20.030> will<00:04:20.810> make

00:04:20.950 --> 00:04:20.960 
faster to invisible combat will make

00:04:20.960 --> 00:04:23.470 
faster to invisible combat will make
either<00:04:21.620> you<00:04:21.979> or<00:04:22.010> your<00:04:22.250> opponent<00:04:22.520> go<00:04:22.940> invisible

00:04:23.470 --> 00:04:23.480 
either you or your opponent go invisible

00:04:23.480 --> 00:04:25.630 
either you or your opponent go invisible
random<00:04:23.840> times<00:04:24.080> it'll<00:04:24.890> show<00:04:25.100> that<00:04:25.130> by<00:04:25.430> a<00:04:25.460> little

00:04:25.630 --> 00:04:25.640 
random times it'll show that by a little

00:04:25.640 --> 00:04:28.840 
random times it'll show that by a little
a<00:04:26.000> blue<00:04:26.630> ring<00:04:27.290> going<00:04:27.530> around<00:04:27.800> you<00:04:28.100> and<00:04:28.340> you

00:04:28.840 --> 00:04:28.850 
a blue ring going around you and you

00:04:28.850 --> 00:04:31.050 
a blue ring going around you and you
just<00:04:28.880> turn<00:04:29.240> invisible<00:04:29.500> completely<00:04:30.500> invisibly

00:04:31.050 --> 00:04:31.060 
just turn invisible completely invisibly

00:04:31.060 --> 00:04:33.400 
just turn invisible completely invisibly
but<00:04:32.060> if<00:04:32.150> you<00:04:32.210> notice<00:04:32.360> your<00:04:32.600> guy<00:04:32.720> will<00:04:33.050> look<00:04:33.260> at

00:04:33.400 --> 00:04:33.410 
but if you notice your guy will look at

00:04:33.410 --> 00:04:35.140 
but if you notice your guy will look at
him<00:04:33.620> the<00:04:34.130> other<00:04:34.160> opponent<00:04:34.640> will<00:04:34.730> look<00:04:34.880> at<00:04:35.000> him

00:04:35.140 --> 00:04:35.150 
him the other opponent will look at him

00:04:35.150 --> 00:04:37.090 
him the other opponent will look at him
so<00:04:35.360> you<00:04:35.420> might<00:04:35.930> have<00:04:36.050> a<00:04:36.080> little<00:04:36.350> bit<00:04:37.070> of

00:04:37.090 --> 00:04:37.100 
so you might have a little bit of

00:04:37.100 --> 00:04:39.160 
so you might have a little bit of
knowing<00:04:37.430> where<00:04:37.610> he<00:04:37.790> is<00:04:37.820> our<00:04:38.120> next<00:04:38.930> one<00:04:39.020> is

00:04:39.160 --> 00:04:39.170 
knowing where he is our next one is

00:04:39.170 --> 00:04:41.200 
knowing where he is our next one is
jumping<00:04:39.380> disabled<00:04:40.040> so<00:04:40.250> you<00:04:40.610> can't<00:04:40.850> jump<00:04:41.120> in

this one any jumping move or you want to
jump<00:04:44.780> over<00:04:44.990> them<00:04:45.140> can't<00:04:45.410> do<00:04:45.590> that<00:04:45.800> um<00:04:47.470> as<00:04:48.470> you

00:04:48.850 --> 00:04:48.860 
jump over them can't do that um as you

00:04:48.860 --> 00:04:50.320 
jump over them can't do that um as you
can<00:04:48.980> see<00:04:49.070> here<00:04:49.280> I<00:04:49.310> try<00:04:49.550> jumping<00:04:49.940> nothing

Bars<00:06:24.250> are<00:06:24.520> disabled<00:06:25.000> so<00:06:25.240> those<00:06:26.170> are<00:06:26.350> both<00:06:26.500> the

00:06:26.820 --> 00:06:26.830 
Bars are disabled so those are both the

00:06:26.830 --> 00:06:30.060
