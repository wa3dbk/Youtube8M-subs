I'll<00:02:51.940> just<00:02:52.120> start<00:02:52.780> you<00:02:52.870> off<00:02:52.960> here<00:02:53.260> by<00:02:55.110> just

00:02:56.100 --> 00:02:56.110 
I'll just start you off here by just

00:02:56.110 --> 00:03:00.900 
I'll just start you off here by just
move<00:02:56.470> this<00:02:56.620> arms<00:02:56.980> up<00:02:59.520> and<00:03:00.520> then<00:03:00.580> we'll<00:03:00.790> just

00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:00.910 
move this arms up and then we'll just

00:03:00.910 --> 00:03:02.580 
move this arms up and then we'll just
start<00:03:01.030> on<00:03:01.240> his<00:03:01.420> feet<00:03:01.840> down<00:03:02.170> here<00:03:02.230> and<00:03:02.530> I'll

00:03:02.580 --> 00:03:02.590 
start on his feet down here and I'll

00:03:02.590 --> 00:03:04.560 
start on his feet down here and I'll
work<00:03:02.950> our<00:03:03.130> way<00:03:03.250> up<00:03:03.280> and<00:03:03.730> finish<00:03:04.060> the<00:03:04.210> top<00:03:04.420> of

00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:04.570 
work our way up and finish the top of

00:03:04.570 --> 00:03:06.960 
work our way up and finish the top of
the<00:03:04.720> arm<00:03:05.020> piece<00:03:05.380> here<00:03:05.590> you<00:03:05.800> just<00:03:06.430> take<00:03:06.580> us<00:03:06.700> back

00:03:06.960 --> 00:03:06.970 
the arm piece here you just take us back

00:03:06.970 --> 00:03:09.810 
the arm piece here you just take us back
to<00:03:07.780> the<00:03:08.100> calves<00:03:09.100> here<00:03:09.370> and<00:03:09.490> just<00:03:09.610> pull<00:03:09.760> them

00:03:09.810 --> 00:03:09.820 
to the calves here and just pull them

00:03:09.820 --> 00:03:15.610 
to the calves here and just pull them
back<00:03:11.820> okay

00:03:15.610 --> 00:03:15.620 

00:03:15.620 --> 00:03:19.380 

continue<00:03:16.549> the<00:03:16.670> same<00:03:16.819> process<00:03:17.530> Yatta<00:03:18.530> Yatta

00:03:19.380 --> 00:03:19.390 
continue the same process Yatta Yatta

00:03:19.390 --> 00:03:24.729 
continue the same process Yatta Yatta
and<00:03:20.390> now<00:03:21.310> you<00:03:22.310> just<00:03:22.519> fold<00:03:23.480> these<00:03:23.599> down<00:03:23.739> and

00:03:24.729 --> 00:03:24.739 
and now you just fold these down and

00:03:24.739 --> 00:03:27.309 
and now you just fold these down and
there's<00:03:25.730> actually<00:03:26.060> a<00:03:26.090> connecting<00:03:26.540> piece<00:03:26.810> this

00:03:27.309 --> 00:03:27.319 
there's actually a connecting piece this

00:03:27.319 --> 00:03:29.140 
there's actually a connecting piece this
little<00:03:27.560> slot<00:03:27.950> here<00:03:27.980> and<00:03:28.489> that<00:03:28.700> little<00:03:28.819> peg

00:03:29.140 --> 00:03:29.150 
little slot here and that little peg

00:03:29.150 --> 00:03:35.319 
little slot here and that little peg
there<00:03:29.390> kind<00:03:30.379> of<00:03:30.470> just<00:03:33.909> snap<00:03:34.909> them<00:03:35.060> into<00:03:35.239> place

00:03:35.319 --> 00:03:35.329 
there kind of just snap them into place

00:03:35.329 --> 00:03:40.180 
there kind of just snap them into place
as<00:03:36.230> so<00:03:37.360> now<00:03:38.360> you<00:03:39.200> have<00:03:39.319> this<00:03:39.440> awesome<00:03:39.739> looking

00:04:59.830 --> 00:04:59.840 
it just looked very very well

00:04:59.840 --> 00:05:01.810 
it just looked very very well
alien-esque<00:05:00.530> of<00:05:00.890> course<00:05:01.250> you<00:05:01.460> know<00:05:01.550> that's

00:05:01.810 --> 00:05:01.820 
alien-esque of course you know that's

00:05:01.820 --> 00:05:03.850

inside of the treads there the sides

00:05:26.720 --> 00:05:29.110 
inside of the treads there the sides
here<00:05:27.170> are<00:05:27.290> a<00:05:27.320> bit<00:05:27.530> more<00:05:27.710> shinier<00:05:28.130> than<00:05:28.340> in<00:05:28.850> this
