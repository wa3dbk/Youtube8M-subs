00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:11.220 
i'll be reviewing these properly in

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:12.920 
i'll be reviewing these properly in
about<00:01:11.430> two<00:01:11.940> to<00:01:11.970> three<00:01:12.149> weeks<00:01:12.299> kind<00:01:12.720> of<00:01:12.780> use

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:12.930 
about two to three weeks kind of use

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:17.779 
about two to three weeks kind of use
them<00:01:13.200> for<00:01:13.440> a<00:01:13.500> bit<00:01:14.659> and<00:01:16.190> the<00:01:17.190> own<00:01:17.280> differences

00:01:17.779 --> 00:01:17.789 
them for a bit and the own differences

00:01:17.789 --> 00:01:20.899 
them for a bit and the own differences
between<00:01:18.289> the<00:01:19.289> vapor<00:01:19.830> and<00:01:19.920> the<00:01:19.979> miracle<00:01:20.429> i<00:01:20.550> can

00:01:20.899 --> 00:01:20.909 
between the vapor and the miracle i can

00:01:20.909 --> 00:01:26.270 
between the vapor and the miracle i can
see<00:01:21.119> is<00:01:21.990> all<00:01:22.710> glass<00:01:23.069> fiber<00:01:23.960> and<00:01:24.960> so<00:01:25.649> quiet<00:01:26.009> set

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:26.280 
see is all glass fiber and so quiet set

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:30.770 
see is all glass fiber and so quiet set
of<00:01:26.780> just<00:01:27.780> this<00:01:27.960> a<00:01:28.020> little<00:01:28.259> bit<00:01:29.780> thinner

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:30.780 
of just this a little bit thinner

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:34.850 
of just this a little bit thinner
material<00:01:31.700> but<00:01:32.700> i<00:01:32.970> think<00:01:33.960> this<00:01:34.110> is<00:01:34.319> thin<00:01:34.830> enough

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:34.860 
material but i think this is thin enough

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:37.880 
material but i think this is thin enough
think<00:01:35.399> it's<00:01:35.550> like<00:01:35.700> the<00:01:35.819> perfect<00:01:36.890> thickness

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:37.890 
think it's like the perfect thickness

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:42.289 
think it's like the perfect thickness
and<00:01:39.259> I<00:01:40.259> i'm<00:01:40.979> not<00:01:41.250> sure<00:01:41.490> but<00:01:41.520> i<00:01:41.729> think<00:01:41.759> the

00:01:42.289 --> 00:01:42.299 
and I i'm not sure but i think the

00:01:42.299 --> 00:01:45.889 
and I i'm not sure but i think the
swoosh<00:01:43.170> is<00:01:43.440> positioned<00:01:44.039> slightly<00:01:44.759> more<00:01:45.360> to

00:01:45.889 --> 00:01:45.899 
swoosh is positioned slightly more to

00:01:45.899 --> 00:01:49.669 
swoosh is positioned slightly more to
the<00:01:46.049> end<00:01:46.319> of<00:01:46.560> the<00:01:46.710> turf<00:01:46.979> not<00:01:47.700> charla<00:01:48.179> and<00:01:48.560> it<00:01:49.560> is

00:01:49.669 --> 00:01:49.679 
the end of the turf not charla and it is

00:01:49.679 --> 00:02:05.419 
the end of the turf not charla and it is
of<00:01:49.979> course<00:01:50.129> smaller<00:01:54.800> also<00:01:55.800> quickly<00:01:59.479> and<00:02:00.479> so<00:02:04.429> is

00:02:05.419 --> 00:02:05.429 
of course smaller also quickly and so is

00:02:05.429 --> 00:02:12.920 
of course smaller also quickly and so is
a<00:02:05.690> nice<00:02:06.690> install<00:02:08.179> it's<00:02:09.179> got<00:02:11.690> see-through<00:02:12.690> and

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:12.930 
a nice install it's got see-through and

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:21.369 
a nice install it's got see-through and
so<00:02:17.150> so<00:02:18.150> i<00:02:18.510> think<00:02:19.110> i'll<00:02:19.470> so<00:02:19.620> this<00:02:19.739> is<00:02:19.890> the<00:02:20.010> first

00:02:21.369 --> 00:02:21.379 
so so i think i'll so this is the first

00:02:21.379 --> 00:02:28.520 
so so i think i'll so this is the first
first<00:02:22.519> miracle<00:02:23.519> 3<00:02:24.330> on<00:02:24.920> youtube<00:02:25.920> currently<00:02:27.530> so

00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:28.530 
first miracle 3 on youtube currently so

00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:32.059 
first miracle 3 on youtube currently so
i'll<00:02:29.519> be<00:02:30.150> reviewing<00:02:30.300> these<00:02:30.720> like<00:02:31.709> seat<00:02:31.950> with
