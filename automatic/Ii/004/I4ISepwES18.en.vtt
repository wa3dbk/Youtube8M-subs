00:00:01.220 --> 00:00:05.400
 how to prevent diarrhea in your pet 

00:00:04.529 --> 00:00:10.349
 pet 

00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:13.290
 It is important that the animal be vaccinated 

00:00:10.349 --> 00:00:17.070
 because there are diseases that lead to 

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:19.980
 clinical signs of diarrhea is was okay 

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:22.170
 a guilty party videos or a distemper 

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:24.720
 or even coronavirus okay then 

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:26.789
 regularly you take the doctor 

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:29.880
 veterinarian to make the necessary 

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:32.820
 vaccinations is in the first year of life 

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:34.710
 and then annually a reinforcement is made 

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:37.800
 vaccination 

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:41.760
 second the second agent factor 

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:45.180
 preventing the animal from having diarrhea is 

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:48.600
 without having a pre-existing disease is 

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:52.410
 you keep this animal always in place 

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:55.020
 cleaned and disinfected when you take it 

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:57.559
 to walk around to prevent it from entering 

00:00:55.020 --> 00:01:01.260
 contact with the faeces of other animals 

00:00:57.559 --> 00:01:03.059
 I was eating grass that is already a sign 

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:07.790
 clinical presentation of what the animal is 

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:11.880
 gastric disorder in the case of cats is 

00:01:07.790 --> 00:01:14.610
 important you will have a bath of his 

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:17.070
 his box always clean or 

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:20.880
 preferably have more than one bath 

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:23.310
 is in the house because the animal he sees that 

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:25.740
 that 's dirty he handles it holds 

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:28.470
 this can lead to gastrointestinal 

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:31.020
 interest and another important factor is 

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:34.619
 you educate your animal to a 

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:37.110
 certain time holds food is not 

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:39.390
 it is for the ration there for example to leave the 

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:43.259
 that action over there because that 

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:45.840
 may have contact with a young woman 

00:01:43.259 --> 00:01:48.509
 ant that are worm carriers 

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:51.420
 the relative humidity of the air 

00:01:48.509 --> 00:01:53.820
 the animal's own saliva in that feed 

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:56.130
 who stays there all day 

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:59.399
 already makes that reason 

00:01:56.130 --> 00:02:01.380
 between one in the fermentation frame and 

00:01:59.399 --> 00:02:03.430
 animal then does not want to know it goes there 

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:06.340
 With me I wish he already is boiling 

00:02:03.430 --> 00:02:09.220
 giving then educates your animal so that 

00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:11.950
 the internal spent appliance is also 

00:02:09.220 --> 00:02:12.910
 educated to work in certain 

00:02:11.950 --> 00:02:16.630
 schedules 

00:02:12.910 --> 00:02:19.660
 for example in the puppy it is important you 

00:02:16.630 --> 00:02:22.090
 food several times a day 

00:02:19.660 --> 00:02:24.520
 It's preferably in the morning because of 

00:02:22.090 --> 00:02:28.570
 morning the renal supra is working 

00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:31.420
 and it is also important in the 

00:02:28.570 --> 00:02:34.930
 internal spending stays there so these are 

00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:37.120
 some tips on how you prevent 

00:02:34.930 --> 00:02:40.930
 animal presents a clinical picture 

00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:44.310
 day because the diarrhea it is 

00:02:40.930 --> 00:02:48.130
 clinical sign but it is extremely 

00:02:44.310 --> 00:02:52.270
 damage to the animal causes the animal to 

00:02:48.130 --> 00:02:55.660
 apathetic anorectic and this is 

00:02:52.270 --> 00:02:59.520
 sometimes leads to the death of the pet ok 

00:02:55.660 --> 00:02:59.520
 A hug is this
