okay<00:00:15.650> so<00:00:15.709> here<00:00:16.279> we<00:00:16.369> are<00:00:16.400> then<00:00:16.670> on<00:00:16.880> the<00:00:17.150> starting

00:00:17.620 --> 00:00:17.630 
okay so here we are then on the starting

00:00:17.630 --> 00:00:21.220 
okay so here we are then on the starting
grid<00:00:17.660> a<00:00:18.170> way<00:00:18.890> to<00:00:18.949> go<00:00:19.279> immediately<00:00:20.020> I'm<00:00:21.020> just

00:00:21.220 --> 00:00:21.230 
grid a way to go immediately I'm just

00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:22.690 
grid a way to go immediately I'm just
struck<00:00:21.560> by<00:00:21.590> it<00:00:21.830> you<00:00:22.010> know<00:00:22.070> visually<00:00:22.550> it's

00:00:22.690 --> 00:00:22.700 
struck by it you know visually it's

00:00:22.700 --> 00:00:24.580 
struck by it you know visually it's
looking<00:00:23.060> a<00:00:23.120> bit<00:00:23.150> more<00:00:23.300> bold<00:00:23.690> now<00:00:24.170> than<00:00:24.440> it<00:00:24.560> was

00:00:24.580 --> 00:00:24.590 
looking a bit more bold now than it was

00:00:24.590 --> 00:00:26.830 
looking a bit more bold now than it was
looking<00:00:24.950> early<00:00:25.190> it's<00:00:25.910> improving<00:00:26.240> piece<00:00:26.630> by

00:00:26.830 --> 00:00:26.840 
looking early it's improving piece by

00:00:26.840 --> 00:00:30.189 
looking early it's improving piece by
piece<00:00:26.869> just<00:00:27.350> very<00:00:27.650> small<00:00:27.920> details<00:00:28.960> we<00:00:29.960> really

00:00:30.189 --> 00:00:30.199 
piece just very small details we really

00:00:30.199 --> 00:00:32.860 
piece just very small details we really
nice<00:00:30.380> feeling<00:00:30.650> intensity<00:00:31.400> of<00:00:31.520> speed<00:00:31.910> I<00:00:32.180> love

00:00:32.860 --> 00:00:32.870 
nice feeling intensity of speed I love

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:34.600 
nice feeling intensity of speed I love
formula<00:00:33.170> cars<00:00:33.649> that's<00:00:33.949> the<00:00:34.070> first<00:00:34.309> thing<00:00:34.460> that

00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:34.610 
formula cars that's the first thing that

00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:36.489 
formula cars that's the first thing that
strikes<00:00:34.879> me<00:00:35.120> when<00:00:35.390> I<00:00:35.420> see<00:00:35.719> a<00:00:35.749> video<00:00:35.929> like<00:00:36.109> this

00:00:36.489 --> 00:00:36.499 
strikes me when I see a video like this

00:00:36.499 --> 00:00:40.209 
strikes me when I see a video like this
is<00:00:37.960> just<00:00:38.960> the<00:00:39.109> feeling<00:00:39.379> of<00:00:39.440> speed<00:00:39.739> the<00:00:40.010> grip

00:00:40.209 --> 00:00:40.219 
is just the feeling of speed the grip

00:00:40.219 --> 00:00:42.610 
is just the feeling of speed the grip
how<00:00:40.460> it's<00:00:40.609> working<00:00:40.819> how<00:00:41.629> the<00:00:41.690> AI<00:00:41.870> is<00:00:42.079> working

00:00:42.610 --> 00:00:42.620 
how it's working how the AI is working

00:00:42.620 --> 00:00:45.430 
how it's working how the AI is working
here<00:00:42.859> as<00:00:42.979> well<00:00:43.190> still<00:00:43.609> in<00:00:43.729> early<00:00:44.059> stage<00:00:44.409> will<00:00:45.409> a

00:00:45.430 --> 00:00:45.440 
here as well still in early stage will a

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:49.029 
here as well still in early stage will a
factor<00:00:45.979> to<00:00:46.159> ever<00:00:46.370> be<00:00:46.579> completed<00:00:47.289> well<00:00:48.289> I<00:00:48.620> think

00:00:49.029 --> 00:00:49.039 
factor to ever be completed well I think

00:00:49.039 --> 00:00:51.340 
factor to ever be completed well I think
it's<00:00:49.309> always<00:00:49.579> going<00:00:49.760> to<00:00:49.850> be<00:00:49.969> a<00:00:49.999> long<00:00:50.350> period

00:00:51.340 --> 00:00:51.350 
it's always going to be a long period

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:54.069 
it's always going to be a long period
but<00:00:51.889> ultimately<00:00:52.760> they're<00:00:53.269> working<00:00:53.629> very<00:00:53.809> hard

00:00:54.069 --> 00:00:54.079 
but ultimately they're working very hard

00:00:54.079 --> 00:00:56.500 
but ultimately they're working very hard
on<00:00:54.379> the<00:00:54.589> physics<00:00:55.100> beneath<00:00:55.489> the<00:00:55.729> surface<00:00:55.969> and

00:00:56.500 --> 00:00:56.510 
on the physics beneath the surface and

00:00:56.510 --> 00:00:58.719 
on the physics beneath the surface and
developing<00:00:57.440> those<00:00:57.620> to<00:00:57.859> the<00:00:57.949> maximum<00:00:58.399> before

00:00:58.719 --> 00:00:58.729 
developing those to the maximum before

00:00:58.729 --> 00:01:00.369 
developing those to the maximum before
really<00:00:58.969> working<00:00:59.359> on<00:00:59.479> the<00:00:59.569> graphical<00:00:59.960> details

00:01:00.369 --> 00:01:00.379 
really working on the graphical details

00:01:00.379 --> 00:01:03.840

here this isn't something I'm I'm

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:12.999 
here this isn't something I'm I'm
necessarily<00:01:11.539> too<00:01:12.020> keen<00:01:12.229> on<00:01:12.350> myself<00:01:12.590> I'm<00:01:12.979> sure

00:01:12.999 --> 00:01:13.009 
necessarily too keen on myself I'm sure

00:01:13.009 --> 00:01:15.749 
necessarily too keen on myself I'm sure
you<00:01:13.310> can<00:01:13.490> dial<00:01:13.729> that<00:01:13.939> down<00:01:14.000> in<00:01:14.390> the<00:01:14.479> options

00:01:15.749 --> 00:01:15.759 
you can dial that down in the options

00:01:15.759 --> 00:01:18.399 
you can dial that down in the options
I've<00:01:16.759> seen<00:01:16.969> that<00:01:17.060> on<00:01:17.180> a<00:01:17.210> few<00:01:17.479> videos<00:01:17.869> it's<00:01:18.229> not

00:01:18.399 --> 00:01:18.409 
I've seen that on a few videos it's not

00:01:20.050 --> 00:01:20.060 
always my bag I always like to think

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:22.179 
always my bag I always like to think
well<00:01:20.240> yes<00:01:20.509> the<00:01:20.750> car<00:01:20.960> might<00:01:21.170> be<00:01:21.200> vibrating<00:01:21.979> but

00:01:22.179 --> 00:01:22.189 
well yes the car might be vibrating but

00:01:22.189 --> 00:01:24.370 
well yes the car might be vibrating but
my<00:01:22.340> vision<00:01:22.700> is<00:01:22.820> steady<00:01:23.149> where<00:01:23.810> is<00:01:23.960> happening

00:01:24.370 --> 00:01:24.380 
my vision is steady where is happening

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:25.959 
my vision is steady where is happening
even<00:01:24.649> if<00:01:24.859> there's<00:01:25.009> a<00:01:25.070> lot<00:01:25.219> of<00:01:25.280> vibration<00:01:25.399> going

00:01:25.959 --> 00:01:25.969 
even if there's a lot of vibration going

00:01:25.969 --> 00:01:26.910 
even if there's a lot of vibration going
through<00:01:26.149> my<00:01:26.270> body

00:01:26.910 --> 00:01:26.920

00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:29.859 
through my body
coming<00:01:27.920> up<00:01:28.009> slipstreaming<00:01:28.549> I'm<00:01:29.270> able<00:01:29.600> to<00:01:29.719> make

it through on a breaking point covering
on<00:01:31.340> the<00:01:31.369> inside<00:01:31.789> the<00:01:31.969> car<00:01:32.179> in<00:01:32.240> front<00:01:32.359> they're

00:01:33.120 --> 00:01:33.130 
on the inside the car in front they're

00:01:33.130 --> 00:01:35.289 
on the inside the car in front they're
wanting<00:01:34.130> to<00:01:34.159> hit<00:01:34.369> those<00:01:34.490> apex<00:01:34.939> ease<00:01:35.090> and<00:01:35.179> get

00:01:37.930 --> 00:01:41.350 
smoothly on the power
now<00:01:38.930> big<00:01:39.650> notes<00:01:39.890> I<00:01:40.070> hear<00:01:40.370> people<00:01:40.700> mentioning

00:01:41.350 --> 00:01:41.360 
now big notes I hear people mentioning

00:01:41.360 --> 00:01:45.390 
now big notes I hear people mentioning
up<00:01:41.510> is<00:01:41.750> the<00:01:42.020> the<00:01:42.920> turbo<00:01:43.370> sound<00:01:43.780> which<00:01:44.780> is<00:01:44.810> a

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:45.400 
up is the the turbo sound which is a

00:01:45.400 --> 00:01:49.060 
up is the the turbo sound which is a
unmissable<00:01:46.960> it's<00:01:47.960> been<00:01:48.200> toned<00:01:48.470> down<00:01:48.650> a<00:01:48.980> bit

00:01:49.060 --> 00:01:49.070 
unmissable it's been toned down a bit

00:01:49.070 --> 00:01:50.710 
unmissable it's been toned down a bit
apparently<00:01:49.700> since<00:01:49.880> this<00:01:50.030> video<00:01:50.330> was<00:01:50.540> produced

00:01:50.710 --> 00:01:50.720 
apparently since this video was produced

00:01:50.720 --> 00:01:52.870 
apparently since this video was produced
because<00:01:51.560> it<00:01:51.680> is<00:01:51.770> a<00:01:51.800> little<00:01:52.280> bit<00:01:52.400> loud<00:01:52.580> the

00:01:52.870 --> 00:01:52.880 
because it is a little bit loud the

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:55.600 
because it is a little bit loud the
actual<00:01:53.150> whistle<00:01:53.600> there<00:01:53.800> as<00:01:54.800> I<00:01:54.950> saw<00:01:55.100> somebody

feeling<00:02:23.270> I<00:02:23.480> will<00:02:24.470> say<00:02:24.620> this<00:02:24.770> the<00:02:24.950> first<00:02:25.190> time

00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:25.370 
feeling I will say this the first time

00:02:25.370 --> 00:02:27.940

you<00:02:25.490> go<00:02:25.610> out<00:02:25.700> in<00:02:25.820> the<00:02:25.850> racing<00:02:26.270> car<00:02:26.560> you<00:02:27.560> go<00:02:27.710> over

00:02:27.940 --> 00:02:27.950 
you go out in the racing car you go over

00:02:27.950 --> 00:02:31.030 
you go out in the racing car you go over
that<00:02:28.070> hit<00:02:28.340> line<00:02:28.550> and<00:02:29.210> you<00:02:29.530> step<00:02:30.530> on<00:02:30.710> it<00:02:30.860> and

00:02:31.030 --> 00:02:31.040 
that hit line and you step on it and

00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:32.530 
that hit line and you step on it and
that's<00:02:31.190> the<00:02:31.580> moment<00:02:31.760> when<00:02:32.150> you<00:02:32.240> for<00:02:32.420> that

00:02:32.530 --> 00:02:32.540 
that's the moment when you for that

00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:34.180 
that's the moment when you for that
initial<00:02:33.050> acceleration<00:02:33.290> go<00:02:33.830> through<00:02:34.040> your

00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:34.190 
initial acceleration go through your

00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:36.130 
initial acceleration go through your
body<00:02:34.310> that's<00:02:35.090> the<00:02:35.150> example<00:02:35.420> I<00:02:35.660> can<00:02:35.840> give<00:02:35.960> to

00:02:36.130 --> 00:02:36.140 
body that's the example I can give to

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:38.590 
body that's the example I can give to
anyone<00:02:36.350> watching<00:02:36.830> is<00:02:36.980> if<00:02:37.460> you're<00:02:37.760> in<00:02:37.880> a<00:02:38.030> an

00:02:38.590 --> 00:02:38.600 
anyone watching is if you're in a an

00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:39.910 
anyone watching is if you're in a an
aeroplane<00:02:39.020> and<00:02:39.470> there's<00:02:39.590> some<00:02:39.740> turbulence

00:02:39.910 --> 00:02:39.920 
aeroplane and there's some turbulence

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:42.100 
aeroplane and there's some turbulence
and<00:02:40.460> the<00:02:40.520> plane<00:02:40.760> drops<00:02:41.030> a<00:02:41.240> few<00:02:41.360> thousand<00:02:41.840> feet

00:02:42.100 --> 00:02:42.110 
and the plane drops a few thousand feet

00:02:42.110 --> 00:02:44.590 
and the plane drops a few thousand feet
you<00:02:42.770> feel<00:02:43.010> that<00:02:43.160> almost<00:02:43.820> horrible<00:02:44.239> feeling

00:02:44.590 --> 00:02:44.600 
you feel that almost horrible feeling

00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:45.910 
you feel that almost horrible feeling
first<00:02:44.840> goes<00:02:45.020> through<00:02:45.260> your<00:02:45.410> body<00:02:45.590> and<00:02:45.770> that's

00:02:45.910 --> 00:02:45.920 
first goes through your body and that's

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:47.380 
first goes through your body and that's
kind<00:02:46.160> of<00:02:46.190> what<00:02:46.340> it's<00:02:46.489> like<00:02:46.610> for<00:02:46.850> the<00:02:46.940> g-force

00:02:47.380 --> 00:02:47.390 
kind of what it's like for the g-force

00:02:47.390 --> 00:02:48.820 
kind of what it's like for the g-force
the<00:02:47.540> first<00:02:47.780> time<00:02:47.989> and<00:02:48.170> feel<00:02:48.380> it<00:02:48.560> when<00:02:48.709> you

00:02:48.820 --> 00:02:48.830 
the first time and feel it when you

00:02:48.830 --> 00:02:50.620 
the first time and feel it when you
accelerate<00:02:49.100> out<00:02:49.459> the<00:02:49.610> pits<00:02:49.820> within<00:02:50.420> your<00:02:50.510> body

00:02:50.620 --> 00:02:50.630 
accelerate out the pits within your body

00:02:50.630 --> 00:02:55.440 
accelerate out the pits within your body
quickly<00:02:51.010> acclimatize<00:02:52.010> itself<00:02:52.489> to<00:02:52.700> it<00:02:54.370> so

00:02:55.440 --> 00:02:55.450 
quickly acclimatize itself to it so

00:02:55.450 --> 00:02:57.940 
quickly acclimatize itself to it so
certainly<00:02:56.450> fast<00:02:56.840> and<00:02:57.110> furious<00:02:57.530> I<00:02:57.620> love<00:02:57.800> the

00:02:57.940 --> 00:02:57.950 
certainly fast and furious I love the

00:02:57.950 --> 00:03:01.540 
certainly fast and furious I love the
fast<00:02:58.160> furious<00:02:58.459> intensity<00:02:59.270> of<00:02:59.360> it<00:02:59.480> all

00:03:01.540 --> 00:03:01.550 
fast furious intensity of it all

00:03:01.550 --> 00:03:05.050 
fast furious intensity of it all
really<00:03:02.360> nice<00:03:02.570> sort<00:03:02.810> of<00:03:02.900> feeling<00:03:03.230> of<00:03:03.290> speed<00:03:04.060> as

00:03:05.050 --> 00:03:05.060 
really nice sort of feeling of speed as

00:03:05.060 --> 00:03:06.730 
really nice sort of feeling of speed as
I<00:03:05.210> say<00:03:05.360> lots<00:03:05.540> of<00:03:05.690> little<00:03:05.900> details<00:03:06.110> here<00:03:06.560> and

00:03:06.730 --> 00:03:06.740 
I say lots of little details here and

00:03:06.740 --> 00:03:09.120 
I say lots of little details here and
there<00:03:06.890> that<00:03:07.100> are<00:03:07.190> constantly<00:03:07.640> improving<00:03:07.820> and

00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:09.130 
there that are constantly improving and

00:03:09.130 --> 00:03:12.490 
there that are constantly improving and
I<00:03:10.130> look<00:03:10.280> forward<00:03:10.610> to<00:03:10.810> I've<00:03:11.810> seen<00:03:12.110> the<00:03:12.200> videos

00:03:12.490 --> 00:03:12.500 
I look forward to I've seen the videos

00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:13.690 
I look forward to I've seen the videos
on<00:03:12.620> the<00:03:12.710> web<00:03:12.830> when<00:03:13.010> you<00:03:13.130> guys<00:03:13.310> don't<00:03:13.490> get<00:03:13.580> the

00:03:13.690 --> 00:03:13.700 
on the web when you guys don't get the

00:03:13.700 --> 00:03:15.070 
on the web when you guys don't get the
chance<00:03:13.880> for<00:03:14.090> your<00:03:14.180> hands<00:03:14.480> on<00:03:14.630> getting<00:03:14.990> a

00:03:15.070 --> 00:03:15.080 
chance for your hands on getting a

00:03:15.080 --> 00:03:18.520 
chance for your hands on getting a
feedback<00:03:15.290> on<00:03:15.620> it<00:03:15.770> I<00:03:16.300> know<00:03:17.300> I've<00:03:18.170> seen<00:03:18.350> the

00:03:18.520 --> 00:03:18.530 
feedback on it I know I've seen the

00:03:18.530 --> 00:03:20.260 
feedback on it I know I've seen the
earlier<00:03:18.800> videos<00:03:19.460> where<00:03:19.790> this<00:03:19.940> is<00:03:20.090> being

00:03:20.260 --> 00:03:20.270 
earlier videos where this is being

00:03:20.270 --> 00:03:24.040 
earlier videos where this is being
tested<00:03:20.540> in<00:03:20.870> a<00:03:20.930> simulation<00:03:22.750> drivers<00:03:23.750> giving

00:03:24.040 --> 00:03:24.050 
tested in a simulation drivers giving

00:03:24.050 --> 00:03:25.690 
tested in a simulation drivers giving
their<00:03:24.200> feedback<00:03:24.380> I<00:03:24.830> think<00:03:24.860> it's<00:03:25.100> important<00:03:25.610> to

00:03:25.690 --> 00:03:25.700 
their feedback I think it's important to

00:03:25.700 --> 00:03:27.130 
their feedback I think it's important to
have<00:03:25.790> real<00:03:26.000> driver<00:03:26.270> feedback<00:03:26.570> to<00:03:26.990> get

00:03:27.130 --> 00:03:27.140 
have real driver feedback to get

00:03:27.140 --> 00:03:29.290 
have real driver feedback to get
something<00:03:27.470> that<00:03:27.590> resembles<00:03:28.070> real-life<00:03:28.460> you

00:03:29.290 --> 00:03:29.300 
something that resembles real-life you

00:03:29.300 --> 00:03:31.090 
something that resembles real-life you
get<00:03:29.420> a<00:03:29.450> lot<00:03:29.540> of<00:03:29.660> people<00:03:29.900> play<00:03:30.050> simulations<00:03:30.770> and

00:03:31.090 --> 00:03:31.100 
get a lot of people play simulations and

00:03:31.100 --> 00:03:32.710 
get a lot of people play simulations and
they<00:03:31.190> immediately<00:03:31.580> think<00:03:31.910> someone<00:03:32.600> should

00:03:32.710 --> 00:03:32.720 
they immediately think someone should

00:03:32.720 --> 00:03:35.260 
they immediately think someone should
handle<00:03:33.110> a<00:03:33.170> certain<00:03:33.500> way<00:03:33.680> but<00:03:34.490> a<00:03:34.550> perceived

00:03:35.260 --> 00:03:35.270 
handle a certain way but a perceived

00:03:35.270 --> 00:03:36.820 
handle a certain way but a perceived
handling<00:03:35.750> is<00:03:35.870> often<00:03:36.200> different<00:03:36.530> from<00:03:36.740> the

00:03:36.820 --> 00:03:36.830 
handling is often different from the

00:03:36.830 --> 00:03:39.730 
handling is often different from the
real<00:03:36.980> thing<00:03:37.300> in<00:03:38.300> terms<00:03:38.690> of<00:03:38.930> feedback<00:03:39.140> on<00:03:39.590> the

00:03:39.730 --> 00:03:39.740 
real thing in terms of feedback on the

00:03:39.740 --> 00:03:41.380 
real thing in terms of feedback on the
wheel<00:03:39.920> and<00:03:40.430> what<00:03:40.550> you're<00:03:40.700> getting<00:03:41.000> from<00:03:41.150> the

00:03:41.380 --> 00:03:41.390 
wheel and what you're getting from the

00:03:41.390 --> 00:03:43.720 
wheel and what you're getting from the
wheel<00:03:42.230> I<00:03:42.500> think<00:03:43.160> that's<00:03:43.310> the<00:03:43.460> big<00:03:43.610> difference

00:03:43.720 --> 00:03:43.730 
wheel I think that's the big difference

00:03:43.730 --> 00:03:45.490 
wheel I think that's the big difference
really<00:03:44.180> is<00:03:44.390> that<00:03:44.570> obviously<00:03:44.900> real<00:03:45.170> racing

00:03:45.490 --> 00:03:45.500 
really is that obviously real racing

00:03:45.500 --> 00:03:47.310 
really is that obviously real racing
drivers<00:03:45.890> are<00:03:46.070> using<00:03:46.430> the<00:03:46.490> feel<00:03:46.730> of<00:03:46.760> the<00:03:46.970> car

00:03:47.310 --> 00:03:47.320 
drivers are using the feel of the car

00:03:47.320 --> 00:03:50.050 
drivers are using the feel of the car
whereas<00:03:48.320> the<00:03:48.830> playing<00:03:49.070> simulation<00:03:49.670> it's<00:03:49.910> much

00:03:50.050 --> 00:03:50.060 
whereas the playing simulation it's much

00:03:50.060 --> 00:03:51.940 
whereas the playing simulation it's much
more<00:03:50.270> visual<00:03:50.690> so<00:03:50.930> you<00:03:50.990> need<00:03:51.200> a<00:03:51.230> lot<00:03:51.470> more<00:03:51.710> back

00:03:51.940 --> 00:03:51.950 
more visual so you need a lot more back

00:03:51.950 --> 00:03:54.490 
more visual so you need a lot more back

00:04:30.480 --> 00:04:32.930 
tested on a range of circuits
and<00:04:31.350> you<00:04:31.470> see<00:04:31.680> it's<00:04:31.800> quite<00:04:31.950> a<00:04:32.070> field<00:04:32.490> there<00:04:32.820> as

and you see it's quite a field there as

00:04:32.940 --> 00:04:35.600 
and you see it's quite a field there as

the breaking has to be done and have to

00:04:55.240 --> 00:04:58.800 
the breaking has to be done and have to
come<00:04:55.390> here<00:04:55.540> that<00:04:55.720> point<00:04:57.300> hope<00:04:58.300> everybody

00:04:58.800 --> 00:04:58.810 
come here that point hope everybody

00:04:58.810 --> 00:05:04.410 
come here that point hope everybody
sensible<00:04:59.410> round<00:04:59.650> the<00:04:59.770> corner<00:05:02.760> so<00:05:03.760> obviously

00:05:04.410 --> 00:05:04.420 
sensible round the corner so obviously

00:05:04.420 --> 00:05:06.150 
sensible round the corner so obviously
it's<00:05:04.600> a<00:05:04.720> still<00:05:04.960> working<00:05:05.440> progress<00:05:05.620> version

00:05:06.150 --> 00:05:06.160 
it's a still working progress version

00:05:06.160 --> 00:05:08.400 
it's a still working progress version
still<00:05:06.370> lots<00:05:06.580> to<00:05:06.700> look<00:05:06.790> forward<00:05:06.850> to<00:05:07.240> I'll<00:05:08.200> be

00:05:08.400 --> 00:05:08.410 
still lots to look forward to I'll be

00:05:08.410 --> 00:05:10.110 
still lots to look forward to I'll be
hopefully<00:05:09.190> doing<00:05:09.340> more<00:05:09.580> and<00:05:09.760> more<00:05:09.910> on<00:05:10.030> our

00:05:10.110 --> 00:05:10.120 
hopefully doing more and more on our

00:05:10.120 --> 00:05:11.610 
hopefully doing more and more on our
factors<00:05:10.570> the<00:05:10.720> months<00:05:10.990> go<00:05:11.200> by

00:05:11.610 --> 00:05:11.620 
factors the months go by

00:05:11.620 --> 00:05:13.080 
factors the months go by
certainly<00:05:12.100> in<00:05:12.220> one<00:05:12.340> of<00:05:12.430> my<00:05:12.520> big<00:05:12.700> plans<00:05:12.970> for

00:05:13.080 --> 00:05:13.090 
certainly in one of my big plans for

00:05:13.090 --> 00:05:15.480 
certainly in one of my big plans for
2013<00:05:13.810> not<00:05:14.290> everything<00:05:14.710> planned<00:05:15.010> that<00:05:15.190> went

00:05:15.480 --> 00:05:15.490 
2013 not everything planned that went

00:05:15.490 --> 00:05:17.340 
2013 not everything planned that went
out<00:05:15.580> the<00:05:15.730> way<00:05:15.850> 2012<00:05:16.720> was<00:05:16.870> planned<00:05:17.140> but

00:05:17.340 --> 00:05:17.350 
out the way 2012 was planned but

00:05:17.350 --> 00:05:18.600 
out the way 2012 was planned but
certainly<00:05:17.800> we've<00:05:17.950> learned<00:05:18.160> a<00:05:18.250> lot<00:05:18.280> this<00:05:18.550> year

00:05:18.600 --> 00:05:18.610 
certainly we've learned a lot this year

00:05:18.610 --> 00:05:20.790 
certainly we've learned a lot this year
and<00:05:18.850> I<00:05:19.030> think<00:05:19.210> next<00:05:19.390> year<00:05:19.690> will<00:05:19.930> be<00:05:19.960> much<00:05:20.650> more

00:05:20.790 --> 00:05:20.800 
and I think next year will be much more

00:05:20.800 --> 00:05:22.290 
and I think next year will be much more

I<00:06:10.569> should<00:06:10.750> imagine<00:06:10.960> in<00:06:11.259> it<00:06:11.409> D<00:06:12.250> box<00:06:12.550> or

00:06:12.719 --> 00:06:12.729 
I should imagine in it D box or

00:06:12.729 --> 00:06:13.950 
I should imagine in it D box or
something<00:06:12.849> like<00:06:13.000> that<00:06:13.090> it<00:06:13.449> was<00:06:13.539> absolutely

00:06:13.950 --> 00:06:13.960 
something like that it was absolutely

00:06:13.960 --> 00:06:15.839 
something like that it was absolutely
amazing<00:06:14.259> but<00:06:14.620> that's<00:06:14.710> it<00:06:14.949> from<00:06:15.159> this<00:06:15.340> R<00:06:15.490> factor

00:06:15.839 --> 00:06:15.849 
amazing but that's it from this R factor

00:06:15.849 --> 00:06:17.939 
amazing but that's it from this R factor
