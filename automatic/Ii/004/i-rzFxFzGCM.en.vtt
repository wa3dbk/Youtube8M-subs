00:00:00.310 --> 00:00:04.110
 hello to all and welcome to ipadou today I propose to test you 

00:00:04.110 --> 00:00:08.590
 a musical application I propose to fire on the themes flowers 

00:00:08.590 --> 00:00:11.359
 with the ivory cubs to be studious 

00:00:11.359 --> 00:00:13.669
 that I will launch immediately 

00:00:13.669 --> 00:00:17.600
 so what about studio is an application that came out the week 

00:00:17.599 --> 00:00:18.600
 last a series 

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:21.430
 avoid any recent and as you can see right away on this 

00:00:21.430 --> 00:00:24.539
 home screen and an application that will offer you 

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:28.999
 a real dive into the world of didier 

00:00:28.999 --> 00:00:33.109
 then you have of course the two decks of two parts and other of 

00:00:33.109 --> 00:00:34.450
 this application 

00:00:34.450 --> 00:00:35.200
 Europe 

00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:39.710
 you load for discs on your turntables furthermore a potential sector 

00:00:39.710 --> 00:00:43.060
 profession that's here then either you can already have pieces that 

00:00:43.060 --> 00:00:46.410
 are pre-record that you can sort alphabetically by 

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:47.230
 duration 

00:00:47.230 --> 00:00:49.290
 or parent of pma 

00:00:49.290 --> 00:00:52.520
 or you can go directly for pieces that are 

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:56.800
 at the end of your music library to an example I'm going to 

00:00:56.800 --> 00:00:59.660
 leave on the first platinum 

00:00:59.660 --> 00:01:02.660
 pieces of tassili coffee 

00:01:04.970 --> 00:01:08.240
 so see the piece of this challenge we do not know how to defile 

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:11.400
 of indicators of the loading of the piece this is it 

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:14.870
 so when it's a piece that comes from outside of the app it's 

00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:18.440
 much longer for change and that's the small the little point 

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:19.920
 negative we will say 

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:23.430
 from this application frozen side charges and other pieces so 

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:26.200
 reflect it's already in 

00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:29.110
 in the application and that's a good way to do a lot faster we did not 

00:01:29.110 --> 00:01:32.470
 not watched by contains not ready while here you have noticed 

00:01:32.470 --> 00:01:34.440
 the visual and well there 

00:01:34.440 --> 00:01:37.860
 in the meantime we explain very quickly so here you can so 

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:40.900
 settled all that is to say what is still for you also have the 

00:01:40.900 --> 00:01:44.800
 possibility to record with the cepex key there your blender 

00:01:44.800 --> 00:01:46.390
 you can return to the menu 

00:01:46.390 --> 00:01:49.240
 then we will see a little bit earlier you have here a few 

00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:52.340
 extracts that are available sooner 

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:55.970
 you can adjust the volume of each of the two turntables europe it 

00:01:55.970 --> 00:01:58.410
 only work when I think about the disc 

00:01:58.410 --> 00:01:59.920
 that's all this allows you to 

00:01:59.920 --> 00:02:03.140
 past that's all of this which those here are allowing you to 

00:02:03.140 --> 00:02:06.619
 go from platinum to hatch so I do not want a plan this is the first 

00:02:06.619 --> 00:02:09.229
 of the two turntables the one on the right 

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:12.229
 I was running out of blood 

00:02:14.189 --> 00:02:16.149
 but in addition the disc turns then 

00:02:16.149 --> 00:02:18.729
 we can only 

00:02:18.729 --> 00:02:22.479
 put some facts and companies two loops for example 

00:02:23.589 --> 00:02:26.589
 the Greens 

00:02:28.899 --> 00:02:31.899
 we must therefore question 

00:02:34.589 --> 00:02:37.589
 so I'm going to train more the same 

00:02:38.199 --> 00:02:41.289
 why he is watched and I spend 80 companies 

00:02:47.289 --> 00:02:51.799
 then we can also read automatically synchronize the tempo of both 

00:02:51.799 --> 00:02:56.129
 pieces so see it I'm at 127 although nine of the pma 

00:02:56.129 --> 00:03:00.849
 on each of the two heats are so we accelerate we will accelerate records 

00:03:00.849 --> 00:03:03.549
 who were here 

00:03:03.549 --> 00:03:06.549
 Besides, we hear very well 

00:03:08.129 --> 00:03:09.839
 so 

00:03:09.839 --> 00:03:13.599
 what I am going to show you also that it is not bad it is this small function 

00:03:13.599 --> 00:03:16.599
 who is the little son 

00:03:18.149 --> 00:03:21.259
 see what the tempo reveals 

00:03:21.259 --> 00:03:22.489
 colvin 

00:03:22.489 --> 00:03:25.409
 the service of blood 

00:03:25.409 --> 00:03:28.409
 I have some defeats 

00:03:48.979 --> 00:03:51.979
 so that's some interesting defections 

00:04:05.059 --> 00:04:08.059
 the means fail to return like that we have nothing good for business 

00:04:08.809 --> 00:04:12.789
 it is an application that is rather rather well done rather complete 

00:04:12.789 --> 00:04:16.949
 rather interesting that would work that works pretty well too so 

00:04:16.949 --> 00:04:20.509
 I'm just going once we have a little concern or the application would be closed a 

00:04:20.509 --> 00:04:21.549
 little talent 

00:04:21.549 --> 00:04:24.650
 so it's a shame to imagine if you have a branch that is 

00:04:24.650 --> 00:04:27.069
 plugged during the application on an amp 

00:04:27.069 --> 00:04:30.809
 and that you're animating an evening that this farm know of a 

00:04:30.809 --> 00:04:32.620
 blow it can be problematic 

00:04:32.620 --> 00:04:36.190
 but you think happened once we'll say that since separated so see them 

00:04:36.190 --> 00:04:37.990
 on this moment it's them 

00:04:37.990 --> 00:04:39.660
 everything works pretty well 

00:04:39.660 --> 00:04:40.639
 then you have or 

00:04:40.639 --> 00:04:42.610
 a lot of useful features 

00:04:42.610 --> 00:04:45.620
 many things to take in hand in this application 

00:04:45.620 --> 00:04:46.930
 eyi you have 

00:04:46.930 --> 00:04:50.740
 after the draw that allows you then you know the heading of the helps 

00:04:50.740 --> 00:04:54.840
 which is very complete one that sounds spans about thirty pages which 

00:04:54.840 --> 00:04:57.610
 is well done which exactly explain to you 

00:04:57.610 --> 00:05:01.029
 how to make an app work for them 

00:05:01.029 --> 00:05:04.029
 to try to make the most of it 

00:05:04.569 --> 00:05:08.009
 you see a year on about thirty pages that we feel excluded so each of 

00:05:08.009 --> 00:05:11.080
 two functions to which the iron cross goes 

00:05:11.080 --> 00:05:14.860
 what are you doing well with as much as you I do not know if you 

00:05:14.860 --> 00:05:16.789
 see that I noticed you 

00:05:16.789 --> 00:05:20.569
 but she is in French so that's really it's really an aspect 

00:05:20.569 --> 00:05:22.240
 not negligible 

00:05:22.240 --> 00:05:23.529
 then you have 

00:05:23.529 --> 00:05:26.529
 the Malagasy case in credit 

00:05:27.569 --> 00:05:30.159
 we will say that we return 

00:05:30.159 --> 00:05:33.009
 you want to talk about it just now I forgot about the kokang boom 

00:05:33.009 --> 00:05:34.360
 actually playing 

00:05:34.360 --> 00:05:37.860
 a disc and you have each other on them on the turntable next 

00:05:37.860 --> 00:05:41.939
 you can activate this function with the headset that you see there while 

00:05:41.939 --> 00:05:44.909
 drool that I just activate that Thursday disables 

00:05:44.909 --> 00:05:47.689
 so if you allow like on a real platinum 

00:05:47.689 --> 00:05:51.099
 listened to what is being done on them one of the two disks 

00:05:51.099 --> 00:05:54.830
 while the other is in the process of two past 

00:05:54.830 --> 00:05:58.970
 which allows you to adjust the moment you started the second 

00:05:58.970 --> 00:05:59.619
 disk 

00:05:59.619 --> 00:06:02.949
 at most a very complete application very well done 

00:06:02.949 --> 00:06:04.169
 rather fluid 

00:06:04.169 --> 00:06:08.650
 % with a heading of adaltis and who was quite well thought out in French 

00:06:09.300 --> 00:06:13.400
 so we will say only small negative point sometimes the discs are a little 

00:06:13.400 --> 00:06:13.639
 long 

00:06:13.639 --> 00:06:17.030
 - you saw it when I played stanley this one compared to that 

00:06:17.030 --> 00:06:19.110
 which answers to the ProvenÃ§als which are already integrated in the application 

00:06:19.110 --> 00:06:20.990
 this one was much longer 

00:06:20.990 --> 00:06:24.169
 so sometimes the discs are a bit long to load 

00:06:24.169 --> 00:06:25.259
 I wanted to say 

00:06:25.259 --> 00:06:28.800
 I once had the crash of the application that closed a little 

00:06:28.800 --> 00:06:29.659
 alone 

00:06:29.659 --> 00:06:33.239
 but good apart from his eyes small worries that you can meet 

00:06:33.239 --> 00:06:36.520
 we are here facing a business application that is rather well done 

00:06:37.069 --> 00:06:40.339
 then the other party favors negative points that may make you tick 

00:06:40.339 --> 00:06:43.569
 it's its price since it is 15 euros 99 so you have to know when 

00:06:43.569 --> 00:06:47.199
 even blow for them applications of this type to that standard and poor's 

00:06:47.919 --> 00:06:50.810
 hard to make cheaper are applications that are well done which 

00:06:50.810 --> 00:06:54.449
 are complete and if they will even be able to serve you imagine that you 

00:06:54.449 --> 00:06:54.740
 want 

00:06:54.740 --> 00:06:58.169
 plug it in and unplug during your savings on an amp 

00:06:58.169 --> 00:07:01.830
 and for that allows you like that to animate an evening one to have in hand 

00:07:01.830 --> 00:07:05.020
 with you your stock of records in your ipad and animate the all the 

00:07:05.020 --> 00:07:05.809
 evening 

00:07:05.809 --> 00:07:10.039
 with your your stock of records and the pieces that are already present at 

00:07:10.039 --> 00:07:11.699
 within this app 

00:07:11.699 --> 00:07:14.680
 so this is an application pulls relatively well done 

00:07:14.680 --> 00:07:19.150
 so complete and that will be ten years old I think every ten years and end 

00:07:19.150 --> 00:07:22.400
 same where all 10 of the professional who do not necessarily want to 

00:07:22.400 --> 00:07:26.080
 bother to take heavy and cumbersome equipment with them 

00:07:26.080 --> 00:07:29.830
 for the range I'm not happy to have presented the most crazy 

00:07:29.830 --> 00:07:33.380
 im very very soon on ipad or for them new presentations 

00:07:33.379 --> 00:07:37.500
 of applications in the elite have had a good weekend goodbye
