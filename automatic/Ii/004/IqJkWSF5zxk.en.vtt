braid
outward<00:01:11.549> so<00:01:12.090> that<00:01:12.119> way<00:01:12.390> you<00:01:12.450> can<00:01:12.750> take<00:01:12.900> your

00:01:13.039 --> 00:01:13.049 
outward so that way you can take your

00:01:13.049 --> 00:01:16.010

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:22.350 
and it rotates out so that I can take

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:24.560 
and it rotates out so that I can take
that<00:01:22.530> index<00:01:22.979> to<00:01:23.460> grab<00:01:23.700> that<00:01:23.909> bottom<00:01:24.330> section

of hair that sticks out from your braid
now<00:02:04.320> at<00:02:04.710> the<00:02:05.070> very<00:02:05.310> ends<00:02:05.670> of<00:02:05.729> the<00:02:05.820> braids<00:02:06.180> if

00:02:06.649 --> 00:02:06.659 
now at the very ends of the braids if

00:02:06.659 --> 00:02:07.849 
now at the very ends of the braids if
you<00:02:06.810> want<00:02:06.990> to<00:02:07.049> add<00:02:07.170> curls

you want to add curls
you<00:02:08.009> want<00:02:08.190> to<00:02:08.280> use<00:02:08.429> very<00:02:08.789> small<00:02:09.000> cold<00:02:09.690> water

00:02:09.919 --> 00:02:09.929 
you want to use very small cold water

00:02:09.929 --> 00:02:12.140 
you want to use very small cold water
wave<00:02:10.289> rollers<00:02:10.679> to<00:02:10.830> do<00:02:10.950> so<00:02:11.220> the<00:02:11.670> reason<00:02:12.000> why<00:02:12.090> you

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:12.150 
wave rollers to do so the reason why you

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:13.640 
wave rollers to do so the reason why you
don't<00:02:12.360> want<00:02:12.569> to<00:02:12.660> use<00:02:12.780> sponge<00:02:13.140> rollers<00:02:13.500> is

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:13.650 
don't want to use sponge rollers is

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:15.020 
don't want to use sponge rollers is
because<00:02:13.920> as<00:02:14.069> you<00:02:14.190> pull<00:02:14.370> it<00:02:14.459> out<00:02:14.670> the<00:02:14.730> water

00:02:15.020 --> 00:02:15.030 
because as you pull it out the water

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:17.000 
because as you pull it out the water
it's<00:02:15.599> going<00:02:15.870> to<00:02:15.989> be<00:02:16.080> holding<00:02:16.290> too<00:02:16.620> much<00:02:16.800> hot

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:17.010 
it's going to be holding too much hot

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:18.110 
it's going to be holding too much hot
water<00:02:17.280> and<00:02:17.430> you<00:02:17.550> don't<00:02:17.700> want<00:02:17.940> to<00:02:18.000> burn

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:18.120 
water and you don't want to burn

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:20.479 
water and you don't want to burn
yourself<00:02:18.269> so<00:02:18.989> for<00:02:19.230> example<00:02:19.680> I've<00:02:19.860> rolled<00:02:20.220> one

00:02:20.479 --> 00:02:20.489 
yourself so for example I've rolled one

00:02:20.489 --> 00:02:22.100 
yourself so for example I've rolled one
section<00:02:20.879> of<00:02:20.970> hair<00:02:21.150> and<00:02:21.540> I'm<00:02:21.629> going<00:02:21.720> to<00:02:21.900> show

00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:22.110 
section of hair and I'm going to show

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:24.140 
section of hair and I'm going to show
you<00:02:22.170> exactly<00:02:22.590> how<00:02:22.920> you<00:02:22.980> do<00:02:23.310> this<00:02:23.580> actual

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:24.150 
you exactly how you do this actual

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:26.420 
you exactly how you do this actual
sealing<00:02:24.540> technique<00:02:24.959> so<00:02:25.560> once<00:02:25.830> you<00:02:25.980> dip<00:02:26.190> it<00:02:26.340> in

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:26.430 
sealing technique so once you dip it in

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:28.550 
sealing technique so once you dip it in
for<00:02:26.700> a<00:02:26.730> little<00:02:26.970> bit<00:02:27.150> you<00:02:27.599> take<00:02:27.870> it<00:02:28.019> out<00:02:28.140> squeeze

00:02:28.550 --> 00:02:28.560 
for a little bit you take it out squeeze

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:30.470 
for a little bit you take it out squeeze
it<00:02:28.709> dry<00:02:28.860> and<00:02:29.280> then<00:02:29.580> you're<00:02:29.819> going<00:02:30.030> to<00:02:30.120> begin

00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:30.480 
it dry and then you're going to begin

00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:33.050 
it dry and then you're going to begin
unwinding<00:02:30.750> the<00:02:31.530> hair<00:02:31.860> off<00:02:32.220> of<00:02:32.670> your<00:02:32.819> roller

00:02:33.050 --> 00:02:33.060 
unwinding the hair off of your roller

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:35.600 
unwinding the hair off of your roller
never<00:02:33.780> snatch<00:02:34.290> the<00:02:34.590> roller<00:02:34.799> from<00:02:35.069> the<00:02:35.250> curls

00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:35.610 
never snatch the roller from the curls

00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:37.130 
never snatch the roller from the curls
because<00:02:35.910> the<00:02:36.000> curls<00:02:36.239> are<00:02:36.330> still<00:02:36.629> warm<00:02:36.959> and

00:02:37.130 --> 00:02:37.140 
because the curls are still warm and

00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:38.930 
because the curls are still warm and
that's<00:02:37.530> going<00:02:37.769> to<00:02:37.830> cause<00:02:38.069> the<00:02:38.250> curls<00:02:38.610> to<00:02:38.670> break

00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:38.940 
that's going to cause the curls to break

00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:41.330 
that's going to cause the curls to break
up<00:02:39.150> or<00:02:39.299> loosen<00:02:39.450> so<00:02:40.140> as<00:02:40.380> the<00:02:40.590> hair<00:02:40.799> begins<00:02:41.130> to

00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:41.340 
up or loosen so as the hair begins to

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:43.339 
up or loosen so as the hair begins to
cool<00:02:41.549> you<00:02:41.970> can<00:02:42.120> then<00:02:42.269> separate<00:02:42.810> it<00:02:42.840> and<00:02:43.049> trim

00:02:43.339 --> 00:02:43.349 
cool you can then separate it and trim

00:02:43.349 --> 00:02:45.259 
cool you can then separate it and trim
off<00:02:43.530> the<00:02:43.709> very<00:02:43.920> ends<00:02:44.370> and<00:02:44.849> once<00:02:45.090> you're

00:02:45.259 --> 00:02:45.269 
off the very ends and once you're

00:02:45.269 --> 00:02:47.690 
off the very ends and once you're
finished<00:02:45.420> curling<00:02:45.900> all<00:02:46.290> of<00:02:46.769> your<00:02:46.950> hair<00:02:47.220> this

00:02:47.690 --> 00:02:47.700 
finished curling all of your hair this

00:02:47.700 --> 00:03:05.509 
finished curling all of your hair this
is<00:02:47.940> how<00:02:48.090> your<00:02:48.299> micro<00:02:48.690> braids<00:02:49.049> will<00:02:49.410> look<00:03:04.519> so

00:03:07.190 --> 00:03:07.200 
now at this point you can do a variety

00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:10.009 
now at this point you can do a variety
of<00:03:07.680> styles<00:03:08.040> with<00:03:08.310> your<00:03:08.519> hair<00:03:08.760> so<00:03:09.299> for<00:03:09.569> example

00:03:11.750 --> 00:03:11.760 
I'm going to be showing you how you can

00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:14.090 
I'm going to be showing you how you can
actually<00:03:12.150> do<00:03:12.540> a<00:03:12.569> twisted<00:03:13.170> design<00:03:13.500> where<00:03:13.980> you

00:03:14.090 --> 00:03:14.100 
actually do a twisted design where you

00:03:14.100 --> 00:03:15.949 
actually do a twisted design where you
twisting<00:03:14.549> small<00:03:14.850> sections<00:03:15.299> of<00:03:15.450> hair<00:03:15.510> and

00:03:15.949 --> 00:03:15.959 
twisting small sections of hair and

00:03:15.959 --> 00:03:17.990 
twisting small sections of hair and
pinning<00:03:16.500> it<00:03:16.650> along<00:03:17.010> the<00:03:17.190> way<00:03:17.340> to<00:03:17.400> create<00:03:17.970> a

00:03:17.990 --> 00:03:18.000 
pinning it along the way to create a

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:19.699 
pinning it along the way to create a
look<00:03:18.359> that<00:03:18.389> you<00:03:18.660> can<00:03:18.840> do<00:03:18.959> with<00:03:19.139> these<00:03:19.290> micro

00:03:19.699 --> 00:03:19.709

00:03:19.709 --> 00:03:21.860 
look that you can do with these micro
braids<00:03:19.980> so<00:03:20.549> after<00:03:20.970> twisting<00:03:21.420> those<00:03:21.540> three

00:03:21.860 --> 00:03:21.870 
braids so after twisting those three

00:03:21.870 --> 00:03:23.240 
braids so after twisting those three
sections<00:03:22.139> you're<00:03:22.470> then<00:03:22.650> going<00:03:22.859> to<00:03:22.920> take<00:03:23.100> the

00:03:23.240 --> 00:03:23.250 
sections you're then going to take the

00:03:23.250 --> 00:03:24.770 
sections you're then going to take the
