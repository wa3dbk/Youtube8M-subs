 here we are with the Venetian unboxing of the 

00:00:34.510 --> 00:00:37.300

00:00:35.530 --> 00:00:39.190
 I bought it now I came to 

00:00:37.300 --> 00:00:42.309
 I put the house on the bed like 

00:00:39.190 --> 00:00:45.760
 see and now we proceed to open it 

00:00:42.309 --> 00:00:48.100
 so then he should open this way 

00:00:45.760 --> 00:00:50.710
 I hate recording with one hand I am 

00:00:48.100 --> 00:00:53.379
 keeping the cameras with each other 

00:00:50.710 --> 00:00:55.210
 trying to open then once 

00:00:53.379 --> 00:00:57.790
 we have another is open we do it 

00:00:55.210 --> 00:00:59.290
 here and see how its box 

00:00:57.790 --> 00:01:01.720
 inside 

00:00:59.290 --> 00:01:03.430
 then as you see here we have the 

00:01:01.720 --> 00:01:04.030
 console that we will go to 

00:01:03.430 --> 00:01:06.430
 April after 

00:01:04.030 --> 00:01:09.730
 here we have the usual manual joypad 

00:01:06.430 --> 00:01:12.520
 of education as always very useful 

00:01:09.730 --> 00:01:14.830
 in fact I will read them sure this is the 

00:01:12.520 --> 00:01:16.360
 joypad and here is the console from now 

00:01:14.830 --> 00:01:18.040
 we will analyze a little the 

00:01:16.360 --> 00:01:21.490
 more closely 

00:01:18.040 --> 00:01:23.500
 ok well then let's start with the most part 

00:01:21.490 --> 00:01:26.350
 useful as I already told you I am 

00:01:23.500 --> 00:01:28.510
 these flyers this as you see 

00:01:26.350 --> 00:01:29.020
 with the miz erupt in ours 

00:01:28.510 --> 00:01:33.040
 tongue 

00:01:29.020 --> 00:01:36.430
 cus also a true in our language o 

00:01:33.040 --> 00:01:37.090
 introductory guide ster big evening in the 

00:01:36.430 --> 00:01:41.140
 our language 

00:01:37.090 --> 00:01:44.260
 here we have the guarantee is all 

00:01:41.140 --> 00:01:46.360
 these things and it's fine while we have here 

00:01:44.260 --> 00:01:48.790
 the safety guide that you don't 

00:01:46.360 --> 00:01:52.420
 interested we know the playstation 

00:01:48.790 --> 00:01:55.870
 now it explodes perfect then we move on to 

00:01:52.420 --> 00:01:58.870
 this cable is probably hollow 

00:01:55.870 --> 00:02:02.110
 of power then we have this the 

00:01:58.870 --> 00:02:05.620
 joypad recharge cable this time 

00:02:02.110 --> 00:02:07.430
 minimum sv and not perfect micro usb 

00:02:05.620 --> 00:02:10.369
 see a simple cable 

00:02:07.430 --> 00:02:12.890
 obviously bound then we pass to these 

00:02:10.369 --> 00:02:15.620
 here are the green faces up close 

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:18.890
 the earphones that I think are a 

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:22.580
 let's say you can build some 

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:26.209
 zotti I will not use okay and that's fine 

00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:27.800
 then finally finally let's say 

00:02:26.209 --> 00:02:30.020
 the introduction of the next gen 

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:33.050
 we had together at the console of the 

00:02:30.020 --> 00:02:35.330
 hdmi or hdmi cable as you want to call it 

00:02:33.050 --> 00:02:38.570
 calls finally won it all e 

00:02:35.330 --> 00:02:41.300
 even the xbox one just say 

00:02:38.570 --> 00:02:43.870
 this case here as how can I tell you 

00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:46.730
 as an attack on television 

00:02:43.870 --> 00:02:50.000
 this is the game I bundled 

00:02:46.730 --> 00:02:53.000
 with the ps4 infamous 6 console 

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:55.670
 now I 'll go and open it here 

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:57.260
 here you see this here we say the 

00:02:55.670 --> 00:02:59.480
 game they give you when he performed the 

00:02:57.260 --> 00:03:02.410
 console with itself bundled console then 

00:02:59.480 --> 00:03:05.090
 we finally have one of the innovations 

00:03:02.410 --> 00:03:06.980
 let's say about the next gen of fashion 4 

00:03:05.090 --> 00:03:11.450
 the new joypad 

00:03:06.980 --> 00:03:13.340
 here you see it like this and in front of it is like this 

00:03:11.450 --> 00:03:16.519
 in the back there is space for the 

00:03:13.340 --> 00:03:17.720
 lucetta but I like to say anyway 

00:03:16.519 --> 00:03:19.940
 like this cute idea 

00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:23.360
 the touchpad is all these things according to 

00:03:19.940 --> 00:03:26.150
 me is not bad and finally here we are 

00:03:23.360 --> 00:03:28.850
 left to say to the strong piece la 

00:03:26.150 --> 00:03:32.360
 real console this is the ps4 

00:03:28.850 --> 00:03:34.910
 which appears before you see in that 

00:03:32.360 --> 00:03:36.380
 We have two spaces for the USB strip 

00:03:34.910 --> 00:03:38.810
 laterally 

00:03:36.380 --> 00:03:40.670
 we have no attack while these 

00:03:38.810 --> 00:03:43.820
 here you see now are the attacks 

00:03:40.670 --> 00:03:45.380
 on the back this el hdmi 

00:03:43.820 --> 00:03:47.450
 I believe this is for the current 

00:03:45.380 --> 00:03:49.489
 I don't know what this is for 

00:03:47.450 --> 00:03:50.900
 for the power supply to this it is for no 

00:03:49.489 --> 00:03:51.230
 the feeder I don't know for that 

00:03:50.900 --> 00:03:55.130
 thing 

00:03:51.230 --> 00:03:57.380
 and this I believe is for singing 

00:03:55.130 --> 00:04:00.140
 mirage and digital a for fiber optics 

00:03:57.380 --> 00:04:02.480
 here now we talk the rules all about 

00:04:00.140 --> 00:04:05.810
 back in the other side just like 

00:04:02.480 --> 00:04:07.700
 we say of the other is also empty as 

00:04:05.810 --> 00:04:09.590
 you see this is the real console e 

00:04:07.700 --> 00:04:11.020
 right now I'll show you a little 

00:04:09.590 --> 00:04:14.020
 details present 

00:04:11.020 --> 00:04:17.709
 here you see this but this is it anyway 

00:04:14.020 --> 00:04:19.900
 the console in server always anyway 

00:04:17.709 --> 00:04:22.540

00:04:19.900 --> 00:04:23.410

00:04:22.540 --> 00:04:24.910
