00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.560
 hello and this is the dictate of I am an addiction 

00:00:05.180 --> 00:00:13.280
 this is renato 

00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:40.739
 and you're afraid of chromatic aberration 

00:00:13.280 --> 00:00:43.079
 now where are you in just as many people 

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:44.399
 you may not know for sure what aberration 

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:49.379
 chromatic 

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:53.160
 talk is this is the meaning of 

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:55.110
 side is the renato explains the agent that 

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:58.020
 What are you going to think about? 

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:59.850
 so you have is light passing through the lens 

00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:01.020
 and from that lens the light 

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:05.489
 modify it 

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:08.520
 the place rays has the issue of the glass 

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:10.110
 but this is the rays of light do not 

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:12.960
 change happens what he calls 

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:16.290
 dispersion and there are several 

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:20.939
 different frequencies of light colors 

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:24.240
 different and each frequency will end 

00:01:20.939 --> 00:01:28.080
 acting in a way after passing 

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:29.610
 the lens that calls the display just to 

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:33.090
 talk more but the way 

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:36.720
 each color will arrive the way it went 

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:39.930
 on then so is perhaps the 

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:42.780
 blue rays is stay longer in 

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:46.799
 Closer angle and each curve and act 

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:48.899
 in a way and then you'll start 

00:01:46.799 --> 00:01:52.320
 to receive the blessing layer also in the 

00:01:48.899 --> 00:01:54.780
 shape is the division of these things, right? 

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:56.460
 so it is almost common to speak of 

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:59.250
 registration error because it is an impression 

00:01:56.460 --> 00:02:02.390
 that there is agreement on the edge are 

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:02.390
 yellow or blue 

00:02:02.580 --> 00:02:07.140
 What happens if we have a glass 

00:02:04.800 --> 00:02:09.360
 straight will not have this difference because 

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:12.180
 all cases a lot on the straight is like the 

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:14.400
 You have a photographic lens is is 

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:15.750
 the rays converge to a point of this 

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:18.090
 difference 

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:20.820
 so it's nice to know that and you do not know 

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:23.220
 only what chromatic aberration when 

00:02:20.820 --> 00:02:25.140
 The kitchen is on the right side 

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:27.000
 are the streets that come from different 

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:30.480
 to fix this the manufacturers 

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:34.290
 place some of lens groups after 

00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:37.950
 one corrected is to stay all together 

00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:43.680
 It's but never one hundred percent is better. 

00:02:37.950 --> 00:02:45.300
 That's all the lenses talk about. 

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:49.590
 better than they are 

00:02:45.300 --> 00:02:51.330
 is she had a bit of santa maria not 

00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:54.630
 there is a lens that is not afraid to go there 

00:02:51.330 --> 00:02:57.540
 It is also interesting to know for example 

00:02:54.630 --> 00:03:00.120
 that exactly the reason for having a 

00:02:57.540 --> 00:03:02.040
 talk only a greater convergence 

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:04.290
 the big glories have more cameras 

00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:07.230
 automatic only thinks the following glass 

00:03:04.290 --> 00:03:11.730
 the front of the lens is more curved then 

00:03:07.230 --> 00:03:13.920
 you will have a greater difference of 

00:03:11.730 --> 00:03:16.110
 years bush and others you have much more to 

00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:19.140
 It's catching him, there's a lot more light coming in. 

00:03:16.110 --> 00:03:20.790
 so obvious what's going to have is going to have to go 

00:03:19.140 --> 00:03:22.769
 further modify the light will have another 

00:03:20.790 --> 00:03:26.250
 chromatic embrace 

00:03:22.769 --> 00:03:28.350
 but even so marks still have a 

00:03:26.250 --> 00:03:31.140
 thing that few people know is that there are 

00:03:28.350 --> 00:03:33.900
 two types of diplomatic revelations in 

00:03:31.140 --> 00:03:38.550
 bless longitudinal latitudinal or 

00:03:33.900 --> 00:03:43.200
 either sides from the top said that 

00:03:38.550 --> 00:03:46.470
 happens to the side are caused by 

00:03:43.200 --> 00:03:49.560
 a difference at the time of this conversion 

00:03:46.470 --> 00:03:52.800
 of this convergence of rays then it 

00:03:49.560 --> 00:03:54.630
 will project one larger than the other 

00:03:52.800 --> 00:03:57.090
 Let's suppose if you could split 

00:03:54.630 --> 00:03:59.250
 the image the redder zone will have 

00:03:57.090 --> 00:04:00.900
 a difference of size there some 

00:03:59.250 --> 00:04:03.030
 cases you may staff of others 

00:04:00.900 --> 00:04:06.840
 smaller than the angle changes 

00:04:03.030 --> 00:04:09.030
 in the case of longitudinal would thus 

00:04:06.840 --> 00:04:13.500
 with more up is due to the 

00:04:09.030 --> 00:04:15.960
 difference of focus is the focal point of 

00:04:13.500 --> 00:04:18.180
 each color of each light frequency 

00:04:15.960 --> 00:04:20.310
 It's different from what gives a type of injury 

00:04:18.180 --> 00:04:23.130
 It gets different better also to say that 

00:04:20.310 --> 00:04:26.040
 there is why in the housing with the 

00:04:23.130 --> 00:04:30.480
 photo it turns red blue sometimes 

00:04:26.040 --> 00:04:34.790
 pink and purple because it 's the one in the elevator it 

00:04:30.480 --> 00:04:38.370
 captures the photos in rgb yes then he is 

00:04:34.790 --> 00:04:43.260
 always take some rgb things or 

00:04:38.370 --> 00:04:44.850
 some junction of them the chuchu you are 

00:04:43.260 --> 00:04:46.350
 It's nice to know that there are a lot of people who think 

00:04:44.850 --> 00:04:48.240
 which then means that the individual 

00:04:46.350 --> 00:04:51.330
 only these three is not because the sensor 

00:04:48.240 --> 00:04:52.710
 capita or rgb in the 

00:04:51.330 --> 00:04:55.350
 nail 2 rgb 

00:04:52.710 --> 00:04:58.350
 now we have said that not even a lens 

00:04:55.350 --> 00:05:01.440
 will have zero chromatic aberration 

00:04:58.350 --> 00:05:03.510
 the good news that there are the profiles 

00:05:01.440 --> 00:05:08.220
 both on camera as programs of 

00:05:03.510 --> 00:05:10.890
 edit then you photograph rome 

00:05:08.220 --> 00:05:12.540
 jotapeg reco jotapeg will leave almost 

00:05:10.890 --> 00:05:15.240
 always chromatic reason because it's already 

00:05:12.540 --> 00:05:17.220
 right after the camera already has the 

00:05:15.240 --> 00:05:20.720
 bad campaign time processing 

00:05:17.220 --> 00:05:23.250
 of the next climatic threat in Mauritius 

00:05:20.720 --> 00:05:25.620
 definition in the photo showed a lot of 

00:05:23.250 --> 00:05:28.590
 chromatic box on the edges that 's where it goes 

00:05:25.620 --> 00:05:30.360
 give greater climate protection is who 

00:05:28.590 --> 00:05:32.910
 it seems that has no resolution has no 

00:05:30.360 --> 00:05:35.340
 definition and when you use the broker 

00:05:32.910 --> 00:05:38.970
 It seems like this but when you arrive 

00:05:35.340 --> 00:05:40.620
 until you lose focus and avoid the aberration 

00:05:38.970 --> 00:05:44.040
 only a little blessing is left 

00:05:40.620 --> 00:05:46.320
 chromatic software can engage with 

00:05:44.040 --> 00:05:49.950
 You go there and take a shower. 

00:05:46.320 --> 00:05:51.510
 It might be that it's a little bit, it 's me. 

00:05:49.950 --> 00:05:53.250
 I think nothing can ever resolve 

00:05:51.510 --> 00:05:57.750
 100% do not know you go there at 

00:05:53.250 --> 00:05:59.640
 photoshop and office or something like that 

00:05:57.750 --> 00:06:02.550
 but I also think this is very 

00:05:59.640 --> 00:06:05.250
 necessary because it will not harm your 

00:06:02.550 --> 00:06:07.050
 photo who will give a 100% zoom on your 

00:06:05.250 --> 00:06:11.670
 photo and the woman and look who has 

00:06:07.050 --> 00:06:13.350
 freak is so do not worry about the 

00:06:11.670 --> 00:06:15.660
 freak when she was big 

00:06:13.350 --> 00:06:18.840
 it is very easy to see the 

00:06:15.660 --> 00:06:21.750
 The automatic response is on tv was on 

00:06:18.840 --> 00:06:22.860
 journalism how they use varied cameras 

00:06:21.750 --> 00:06:25.169
 many times and realize the loss 

00:06:22.860 --> 00:06:27.470
 Automatic matter served him ladinho 

00:06:25.169 --> 00:06:30.650
 came the sheet all 

00:06:27.470 --> 00:06:32.210
 so it is not a theme either when 

00:06:30.650 --> 00:06:34.220
 you get very comfortable with it. 

00:06:32.210 --> 00:06:36.290
 older lenses 

00:06:34.220 --> 00:06:38.390
 they have more the blessing with forests on the left 

00:06:36.290 --> 00:06:39.470
 also has more traumatic injury and 

00:06:38.390 --> 00:06:42.260
 fixed right 

00:06:39.470 --> 00:06:44.960
 but it's nothing you can not use 

00:06:42.260 --> 00:06:49.820
 that you can not do to your 

00:06:44.960 --> 00:06:52.310
 work and is fearless now 

00:06:49.820 --> 00:06:53.870
 Afraid because who is saying that is not 

00:06:52.310 --> 00:06:55.610
 You're not afraid of the freak anymore. 

00:06:53.870 --> 00:07:00.770
 chromatic also had reaction will only 

00:06:55.610 --> 00:07:02.840
 want to never in the 70 200 shop while 

00:07:00.770 --> 00:07:04.520
 - Better but not a thing that will 

00:07:02.840 --> 00:07:06.050
 I 'm not going to buy a lens because 

00:07:04.520 --> 00:07:09.050
 she has more chromatic obligation today 

00:07:06.050 --> 00:07:11.780
 It's me, I see a lot of people say that you 

00:07:09.050 --> 00:07:12.920
 see the previous video of the agent revealed 

00:07:11.780 --> 00:07:15.020
 right here 

00:07:12.920 --> 00:07:17.720
 a lot of people say that our only one 

00:07:15.020 --> 00:07:21.169
 contact with animals as a favorite does not 

00:07:17.720 --> 00:07:22.580
 saw and also has a lot of good people that 

00:07:21.169 --> 00:07:23.750
 People say that it is good to give the same 

00:07:22.580 --> 00:07:26.919
 level and ration 

00:07:23.750 --> 00:07:31.040
 so do not go in the wave pre- 

00:07:26.919 --> 00:07:33.200
 try is the best way to know the 

00:07:31.040 --> 00:07:34.310
 who has a male who has less now 

00:07:33.200 --> 00:07:37.490
 lost your fear right? 

00:07:34.310 --> 00:07:38.900
 I hope you have lost even is the 

00:07:37.490 --> 00:07:40.010
 people will not teach like tiradentes 

00:07:38.900 --> 00:07:41.990
 automatic 

00:07:40.010 --> 00:07:44.690
 now it's just popping today and we're just going 

00:07:41.990 --> 00:07:48.140
 Teach okay, here it is. Ok, it's closed. 

00:07:44.690 --> 00:07:50.140
 So this beauty she clicked baneb our 

00:07:48.140 --> 00:07:52.790
 it's magic 

00:07:50.140 --> 00:07:54.020
 Good, I hope you have. 

00:07:52.790 --> 00:07:55.669
 liked 

00:07:54.020 --> 00:07:57.800
 we tried to make a quick program a lot 

00:07:55.669 --> 00:07:59.229
 people do not have laziness of ten fifteen
