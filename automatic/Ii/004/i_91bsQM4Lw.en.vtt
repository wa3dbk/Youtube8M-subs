graphics<00:04:17.650> card<00:04:17.950> is<00:04:18.100> an<00:04:18.220> amazing<00:04:18.760> it's<00:04:18.880> an<00:04:18.970> msi

00:04:19.380 --> 00:04:19.390 
graphics card is an amazing it's an msi

00:04:19.390 --> 00:04:22.890 
graphics card is an amazing it's an msi
but<00:04:20.700> it<00:04:21.700> looks<00:04:22.150> pretty<00:04:22.270> cool<00:04:22.390> from<00:04:22.660> idea

00:04:22.890 --> 00:04:22.900 
but it looks pretty cool from idea

00:04:22.900 --> 00:04:25.680 
but it looks pretty cool from idea
though<00:04:23.640> the<00:04:24.640> graphics<00:04:25.030> card<00:04:25.360> I<00:04:25.390> will<00:04:25.570> be

00:04:25.680 --> 00:04:25.690 
though the graphics card I will be

00:04:25.690 --> 00:04:28.050 
though the graphics card I will be
getting<00:04:25.810> now<00:04:26.080> if<00:04:26.800> this<00:04:26.979> doesn't<00:04:27.190> do<00:04:27.430> my<00:04:27.760> job
