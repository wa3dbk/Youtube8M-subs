00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:21.760 
and I guess we just play a mirror I

00:01:21.760 --> 00:01:24.850 
and I guess we just play a mirror I
could<00:01:22.760> factor<00:01:23.030> fiction<00:01:23.510> but<00:01:23.930> I<00:01:24.200> don't<00:01:24.770> feel

00:01:24.850 --> 00:01:24.860 
could factor fiction but I don't feel

00:01:24.860 --> 00:01:26.710

00:01:26.710 --> 00:01:26.720 
like the starting i'll even know what i

00:01:26.720 --> 00:01:36.880 
like the starting i'll even know what i
need<00:01:26.750> all<00:01:28.540> the<00:01:29.540> blossoms
