00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.710
 I did not know I wanted to ask a question 

00:00:02.070 --> 00:00:07.410
 everything when you grab and throw in a 

00:00:04.710 --> 00:00:09.330
 trash can a piece of newspaper 

00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:11.010
 because I do not read it any more weight of 

00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:13.139
 magazine because they already use it that the law 

00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:15.809
 is too much a piece of cardboard 

00:00:13.139 --> 00:00:18.180
 something that you bought and you leave if you come back 

00:00:15.809 --> 00:00:20.220
 to the trash can and look inside there is and 

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:22.830
 I see pieces of magazine paper and 

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:25.170
 pretty made cardboard that has yes but 

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:28.980
 there is a world in which when you go back to 

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:31.019
 look a wallet appears unclear 

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:33.110
 like that because there is a pass to where with 

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:36.600
 that material can be built 

00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:40.520
 recycled eco wallets that from 

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:40.520
 once I loved look please 

00:00:44.300 --> 00:00:51.100
 both 

00:00:48.490 --> 00:00:53.290
 Hello, we started with the workshop today 

00:00:51.100 --> 00:00:55.830
 We are going to recycle a tetra container and go 

00:00:53.290 --> 00:00:55.830
 to a wallet 

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:07.409
 the lady marked us a line in the 

00:01:03.089 --> 00:01:08.970
 box and we remember it to be given 

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:10.649
 account of how to do the shape of the 

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:12.630
 wallet is folded in half but 

00:01:10.649 --> 00:01:15.680
 being at the athletic outside or aiming 

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:15.680
 this and this part 

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:24.600
 can we cut what we are going to 

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:26.190
 paste the good paper decorate here 

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:33.030
 they have figures they can paint 

00:01:26.190 --> 00:01:35.100
 cut and paste I'm also painting 

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:41.630
 a pony and that's what I 'm going to put the 

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:49.080
 checkbook lid and initial function 

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:52.259
 and to protect the collage we are going to paste 

00:01:49.080 --> 00:01:54.600
 This self- adhesive protective paper for 

00:01:52.259 --> 00:01:56.580
 that we do not complicate hitting what we're going 

00:01:54.600 --> 00:02:00.810
 to parts first we treat them is a 

00:01:56.580 --> 00:02:02.580
 participates and we fold the paper like that 

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:05.160
 ok right the rest of what we're going to 

00:02:02.580 --> 00:02:08.060
 paste we create what school and the rest 

00:02:05.160 --> 00:02:08.060
 it is much easier 

00:02:10.219 --> 00:02:14.819
 to pass the elastic that is going to close 

00:02:13.049 --> 00:02:17.840
 the wallet we make a hole in the 

00:02:14.819 --> 00:02:17.840
 half of pita 

00:02:22.450 --> 00:02:28.490
 we decorate well we are putting ribbon 

00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:32.290
 color for the edges because it is better 

00:02:28.490 --> 00:02:32.290
 and they take all the errors 

00:02:33.210 --> 00:02:40.170
 when we finish the good all these 

00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:41.040
 appointments we make a knot like that and we had it 

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:42.590
 over here 

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:44.640
 [Music] 

00:02:42.590 --> 00:02:46.510
 the hole 

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:49.400
 [Music] 

00:02:46.510 --> 00:02:49.860
 we notice and we can put it together 

00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:51.060
 same 

00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:53.300
 [Music] 

00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:56.280
 and it stayed that way 

00:02:53.300 --> 00:02:59.370
 and we close the wallet 

00:02:56.280 --> 00:03:02.299
 to put it like that 

00:02:59.370 --> 00:03:02.299
 and I have
