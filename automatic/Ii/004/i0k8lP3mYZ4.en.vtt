00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.020
 hello they talk to you what brush in this 

00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:06.060
 I am going to show you how we can 

00:00:04.020 --> 00:00:08.490
 put our apps in style 

00:00:06.060 --> 00:00:11.370
 floating that is to say it is an idea 

00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:13.349
 basic is like samsung pop pop or 

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:15.929
 the slider and that allows us to have 

00:00:13.349 --> 00:00:17.789
 applications in the foreground even on 

00:00:15.929 --> 00:00:20.430
 the applications that we have is to say 

00:00:17.789 --> 00:00:23.189
 if we open an application and enter 

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:25.470
 either to the application menu or to the dial 

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:27.990
 the application is still one time 

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:29.939
 explained what are we going to do what 

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:31.859
 only that we will need requirement 

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:34.800
 is to have the installer ex post 

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:36.270
 installed and do not know how to install it already 

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:39.300
 that below in the description I'm going to 

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:41.850
 leave the tutorial how to install it a 

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:44.640
 is that they have the export installer go to 

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:46.680
 download the next module of equal 

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:49.170
 way and a description I will leave you 

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:51.000
 the direct link of the module and you what 

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:53.730
 can download from there and install it 

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:58.320
 manually or from the same installer 

00:00:53.730 --> 00:01:00.719
 ex post would this module excel or floyd 

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:03.840
 team windows once they have 

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:05.880
 downloaded and activated will proceed to 

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:08.159
 open it 

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:10.200
 this interface even if it comes in English 

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:11.850
 it is very intuitive to use you already 

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:14.070
 they are moving as they go 

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:16.200
 using everything is a matter of giving 

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:18.299
 be trying but let's go to what we 

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:22.530
 interesting the first step we have to 

00:01:18.299 --> 00:01:26.069
 do is go to pop pop dj board and they go to 

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:30.300
 give and they will go to the bottom and 

00:01:26.069 --> 00:01:32.400
 they are going to click on white list apps 

00:01:30.300 --> 00:01:34.650
 they will appear this message they give 

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:36.300
 remember and you decide if you want 

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:38.400
 I want this message to come back or not 

00:01:36.300 --> 00:01:41.160
 in case it is not going to give him close forever 

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:43.290
 here they will add the applications as 

00:01:41.160 --> 00:01:45.600
 the open they want it to come out in style 

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:49.040
 floating in this case then we're going to 

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:52.840
 add the most basic let's say as 

00:01:49.040 --> 00:01:52.840
 let's add the browser 

00:01:55.280 --> 00:02:01.180
 and we are going to add another application 

00:01:58.310 --> 00:02:01.180
 to add I do not know 

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:08.979
 messages let's add a third 

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:12.250
 as for example I do not know 

00:02:08.979 --> 00:02:14.590
 link to s we can add the 

00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:17.530
 applications that we want but I think that 

00:02:14.590 --> 00:02:20.290
 in a matter of open applications in 

00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:22.840
 pop pop style in the floating style 

00:02:20.290 --> 00:02:24.459
 only allows two is it a matter of cutting 

00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:27.160
 let's read let's leave these three for 

00:02:24.459 --> 00:02:29.530
 try once they have done this go 

00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:32.350
 to return 

00:02:29.530 --> 00:02:35.260
 once we have done this we are going to 

00:02:32.350 --> 00:02:37.750
 go to the option that says show apps in 

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:39.610
 recent and they are going to mark it 

00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:43.390
 return to the main menu 

00:02:39.610 --> 00:02:46.150
 let's go to mobile ball and say bold and 

00:02:43.390 --> 00:02:48.910
 let's put it in if the title the bar 

00:02:46.150 --> 00:02:51.790
 settings settings let's select what 

00:02:48.910 --> 00:02:54.940
 we were going to use the two options one 

00:02:51.790 --> 00:02:57.480
 Once this is done, we can return 

00:02:54.940 --> 00:03:00.490
 and we can leave the application 

00:02:57.480 --> 00:03:03.310
 would be the most basic adjustments of this 

00:03:00.490 --> 00:03:05.890
 application you are already moving to your 

00:03:03.310 --> 00:03:07.480
 way or to your liking let's do the 

00:03:05.890 --> 00:03:09.330
 first test we are going to open the 

00:03:07.480 --> 00:03:12.210
 browser 

00:03:09.330 --> 00:03:13.350
 and will open us in this way to that 

00:03:12.210 --> 00:03:15.900
 you may realize that the application 

00:03:13.350 --> 00:03:18.450
 opened in floating style and not in all the 

00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:20.310
 screen if we are at what 

00:03:18.450 --> 00:03:22.920
 has been our applications continues 

00:03:20.310 --> 00:03:25.830
 staying in this plane which is 

00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:29.490
 very nice to my liking 

00:03:25.830 --> 00:03:31.250
 let's show the most basic we can 

00:03:29.490 --> 00:03:35.930
 resize them without any problem 

00:03:31.250 --> 00:03:35.930
 We can move around the screen 

00:03:35.970 --> 00:03:40.380
 and we can continue interacting with the 

00:03:38.130 --> 00:03:42.450
 lower screen yes without any 

00:03:40.380 --> 00:03:44.910
 inconvenient 

00:03:42.450 --> 00:03:47.280
 I'm going to enlarge it so that it appreciates 

00:03:44.910 --> 00:03:49.050
 better another of the options you have is 

00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:51.269
 that we can blur the application in 

00:03:49.050 --> 00:03:52.890
 close-up to be able to appreciate what 

00:03:51.269 --> 00:03:55.019
 it is down without any problem 

00:03:52.890 --> 00:03:58.590
 we click on the three dots in 

00:03:55.019 --> 00:04:01.550
 transparency and there you can see how 

00:03:58.590 --> 00:04:04.220
 the application is blurring I know 

00:04:01.550 --> 00:04:07.950
 similarly in the explanation follows 

00:04:04.220 --> 00:04:10.290
 working without any problem 

00:04:07.950 --> 00:04:12.989
 and I click on images and avoided 

00:04:10.290 --> 00:04:15.569
 access to it we change to google 

00:04:12.989 --> 00:04:17.570
 images the truth because yes it is one of the 

00:04:15.569 --> 00:04:20.250
 of the modules that I liked the most 

00:04:17.570 --> 00:04:22.590
 we can also if we do not like having it 

00:04:20.250 --> 00:04:24.510
 so we can likewise put it on 

00:04:22.590 --> 00:04:27.600
 full screen by clicking on the 

00:04:24.510 --> 00:04:29.550
 little dots on the arrows in the 

00:04:27.600 --> 00:04:31.350
 up for the full screen and for 

00:04:29.550 --> 00:04:33.150
 return it to its original state only 

00:04:31.350 --> 00:04:35.220
 we click again on the arrow of 

00:04:33.150 --> 00:04:37.380
 above we click on the arrow towards 

00:04:35.220 --> 00:04:39.840
 down is minimized to our bar 

00:04:37.380 --> 00:04:41.550
 notifications the problem that I have seen 

00:04:39.840 --> 00:04:43.440
 is that after doing that I do not know 

00:04:41.550 --> 00:04:45.630
 can you restore I remind you that this 

00:04:43.440 --> 00:04:48.510
 module is in beta so therefore still 

00:04:45.630 --> 00:04:51.030
 a lot of development is missing and then in itself 

00:04:48.510 --> 00:04:53.940
 would be the most basic thing we are going to proceed to 

00:04:51.030 --> 00:04:56.340
 close it and we will open as per 

00:04:53.940 --> 00:04:58.950
 example the link to sd application that 

00:04:56.340 --> 00:05:01.409
 was one of those that we also put so that 

00:04:58.950 --> 00:05:04.129
 put themselves in this mode 

00:05:01.409 --> 00:05:08.959
 here it is 

00:05:04.129 --> 00:05:11.800
 and there it is in the floating mode that 

00:05:08.959 --> 00:05:14.830
 we can resize 

00:05:11.800 --> 00:05:17.020
 let's see if it allows us to open more than 

00:05:14.830 --> 00:05:20.520
 an application is that the truth is no longer 

00:05:17.020 --> 00:05:20.520
 I remember how many allow us 

00:05:25.540 --> 00:05:31.060
 let's open the message and poetry to 

00:05:29.080 --> 00:05:34.090
 seem to only allow us to open a 

00:05:31.060 --> 00:05:36.370
 application for the same time it may be that 

00:05:34.090 --> 00:05:38.800
 let us more is a matter of seeing it in 

00:05:36.370 --> 00:05:40.240
 the settings of the application also 

00:05:38.800 --> 00:05:41.980
 to close the application I think if 

00:05:40.240 --> 00:05:43.720
 I told them it is enough to give in the X 

00:05:41.980 --> 00:05:46.330
 because this would be all the memory that 

00:05:43.720 --> 00:05:49.090
 only requirement is to have the installer 

00:05:46.330 --> 00:05:51.250
 exposed and that the module is compatible 

00:05:49.090 --> 00:05:54.040
 with your device since many times 

00:05:51.250 --> 00:05:55.830
 Well, the Android version did not depend 

00:05:54.040 --> 00:05:59.860
 it works I've tried it from 

00:05:55.830 --> 00:06:02.170
 4.1 Asia up to 4.4 and it has worked without 

00:05:59.860 --> 00:06:04.120
 no problem I have not tried it with ice 

00:06:02.170 --> 00:06:05.950
 cream sanwich in the same way if you do not 

00:06:04.120 --> 00:06:08.440
 you can install the module is that not 

00:06:05.950 --> 00:06:10.090
 it is not compatible because on my part it would be 

00:06:08.440 --> 00:06:12.310
 everything but you liked it and more than 

00:06:10.090 --> 00:06:15.510
 nothing comes to work and see you 

00:06:12.310 --> 00:06:15.510
 until next time
