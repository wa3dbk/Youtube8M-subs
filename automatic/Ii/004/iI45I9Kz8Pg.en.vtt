00:00:04.800 --> 00:00:07.440 

lick<00:00:05.800> number<00:00:05.950> 50<00:00:06.340> is<00:00:06.400> called<00:00:06.670> linear<00:00:06.880> salute

00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:07.450 
lick number 50 is called linear salute

00:00:07.450 --> 00:00:10.080 
lick number 50 is called linear salute
and<00:00:07.630> this<00:00:08.170> is<00:00:08.380> just<00:00:08.559> taking<00:00:08.850> B<00:00:09.850> minor

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:10.090 
and this is just taking B minor

00:00:10.090 --> 00:00:12.420 
and this is just taking B minor
pentatonic<00:00:10.450> and<00:00:11.020> playing<00:00:11.469> the<00:00:11.889> notes<00:00:12.160> a

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:12.430 
pentatonic and playing the notes a

00:00:12.430 --> 00:00:15.299 
pentatonic and playing the notes a
linear<00:00:12.969> in<00:00:13.210> octaves<00:00:14.019> and<00:00:14.320> by<00:00:14.800> doing<00:00:14.860> that<00:00:15.160> it

00:00:15.299 --> 00:00:15.309 
linear in octaves and by doing that it

00:00:15.309 --> 00:00:17.730 
linear in octaves and by doing that it
really<00:00:15.730> breaks<00:00:16.059> up<00:00:16.330> the<00:00:16.360> sound<00:00:16.720> a<00:00:16.990> lot<00:00:17.140> you<00:00:17.590> can

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:17.740 
really breaks up the sound a lot you can

00:00:17.740 --> 00:00:19.560 
really breaks up the sound a lot you can
really<00:00:18.009> move<00:00:18.250> this<00:00:18.430> like<00:00:18.670> around<00:00:19.029> ascend

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:19.570 
really move this like around ascend

00:00:19.570 --> 00:00:21.749 
really move this like around ascend
ascend<00:00:20.170> and<00:00:20.439> it<00:00:20.890> can<00:00:21.040> break<00:00:21.189> you<00:00:21.340> out<00:00:21.430> of<00:00:21.550> ruts

00:00:21.749 --> 00:00:21.759 
ascend and it can break you out of ruts

00:00:21.759 --> 00:00:23.040 
ascend and it can break you out of ruts
also<00:00:22.090> because<00:00:22.329> it<00:00:22.419> gets<00:00:22.540> you<00:00:22.660> in<00:00:22.779> one<00:00:22.899> position

00:00:23.040 --> 00:00:23.050 
also because it gets you in one position

00:00:23.050 --> 00:00:25.639 
also because it gets you in one position
to<00:00:23.320> the<00:00:23.500> next<00:00:23.919> really<00:00:24.340> smooth<00:00:24.669> and<00:00:24.910> easily<00:00:25.360> and

00:00:25.639 --> 00:00:25.649 
to the next really smooth and easily and

00:00:25.649 --> 00:00:51.090 
to the next really smooth and easily and
I'll<00:00:26.649> give<00:00:26.800> that<00:00:26.980> one<00:00:27.099> a<00:00:27.130> shot

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:51.100 

00:00:51.100 --> 00:00:54.340 

this<00:00:52.100> idea<00:00:52.430> here<00:00:52.640> is<00:00:52.670> also<00:00:52.970> in<00:00:53.180> B<00:00:53.660> pentatonic

00:00:54.340 --> 00:00:54.350 
this idea here is also in B pentatonic

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:57.700 
this idea here is also in B pentatonic
and<00:00:55.870> what's<00:00:56.870> going<00:00:57.110> on<00:00:57.199> here<00:00:57.350> is<00:00:57.410> the<00:00:57.500> minor

00:00:57.700 --> 00:00:57.710 
and what's going on here is the minor

00:00:57.710 --> 00:01:01.479 
and what's going on here is the minor
pentatonic<00:00:58.750> just<00:00:59.750> basically<00:01:00.140> the<00:01:00.440> idea<00:01:01.129> is

00:01:01.479 --> 00:01:01.489 
pentatonic just basically the idea is

00:01:01.489 --> 00:01:03.250 
pentatonic just basically the idea is
simple<00:01:01.909> we're<00:01:02.059> playing<00:01:02.360> octaves<00:01:02.659> but<00:01:03.140> we're

00:01:03.250 --> 00:01:03.260 
simple we're playing octaves but we're

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:06.670 
simple we're playing octaves but we're
walking<00:01:03.680> up<00:01:03.829> linear<00:01:04.190> up<00:01:04.489> the<00:01:04.820> scale<00:01:05.089> so<00:01:05.780> we're

00:01:06.670 --> 00:01:06.680 
walking up linear up the scale so we're

00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:13.660 
walking up linear up the scale so we're
on<00:01:06.710> the<00:01:07.250> third<00:01:07.430> string<00:01:07.670> you<00:01:07.820> would<00:01:07.940> have<00:01:12.670> the

00:01:13.660 --> 00:01:13.670 
on the third string you would have the

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:20.560 
on the third string you would have the
first<00:01:13.850> string<00:01:14.119> you<00:01:14.270> would<00:01:14.390> have<00:01:18.820> and<00:01:19.820> by

00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:20.570 
first string you would have and by

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:22.960 
first string you would have and by
plucking<00:01:20.899> the<00:01:21.110> first<00:01:21.289> met<00:01:21.470> with<00:01:21.560> your<00:01:21.649> pic<00:01:21.970> and

00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:22.970 
plucking the first met with your pic and

00:01:22.970 --> 00:01:25.090 
plucking the first met with your pic and
picking<00:01:23.750> the<00:01:24.080> first<00:01:24.530> string<00:01:24.679> of<00:01:24.800> your<00:01:24.860> middle

00:01:25.090 --> 00:01:25.100 
picking the first string of your middle

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:30.910 
picking the first string of your middle
finger<00:01:25.869> you<00:01:26.869> got<00:01:27.020> this<00:01:27.140> interesting<00:01:29.740> you<00:01:30.740> by

00:01:30.910 --> 00:01:30.920 
finger you got this interesting you by

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:33.279 
finger you got this interesting you by
using<00:01:31.130> the<00:01:31.369> slide<00:01:31.700> you<00:01:32.390> can<00:01:32.570> really<00:01:32.899> make<00:01:33.140> this

00:01:33.279 --> 00:01:33.289 
using the slide you can really make this

00:01:33.289 --> 00:01:43.090 
using the slide you can really make this
thing<00:01:33.530> talk<00:01:40.270> so<00:01:41.270> we<00:01:41.390> walk<00:01:41.570> straight<00:01:41.869> up<00:01:42.020> that<00:01:42.229> B

00:01:43.090 --> 00:01:43.100 
thing talk so we walk straight up that B

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:50.859 
thing talk so we walk straight up that B
minor<00:01:43.580> pentatonic<00:01:47.649> and<00:01:49.209> you<00:01:50.209> get<00:01:50.539> up<00:01:50.660> to<00:01:50.780> the

00:01:50.859 --> 00:01:50.869 
minor pentatonic and you get up to the

00:01:50.869 --> 00:01:58.479 
minor pentatonic and you get up to the
high<00:01:51.020> high<00:01:51.440> e<00:01:51.470> there<00:01:56.170> and<00:01:57.170> I'm<00:01:58.039> just<00:01:58.220> trying<00:01:58.459> to

00:01:58.479 --> 00:01:58.489 
high high e there and I'm just trying to

00:01:58.489 --> 00:01:59.979 
high high e there and I'm just trying to
finish<00:01:58.700> off<00:01:59.000> the<00:01:59.149> phrase<00:01:59.420> with<00:01:59.630> something

00:01:59.979 --> 00:01:59.989 
finish off the phrase with something

00:01:59.989 --> 00:02:03.400 
finish off the phrase with something
that<00:02:00.160> sounds<00:02:01.160> nice<00:02:01.509> so<00:02:02.509> let's<00:02:03.080> go<00:02:03.200> up<00:02:03.289> the

00:02:03.400 --> 00:02:03.410 
that sounds nice so let's go up the

00:02:03.410 --> 00:02:12.210 
that sounds nice so let's go up the
whole<00:02:03.560> thing<00:02:05.140> really<00:02:06.140> slow

00:02:12.210 --> 00:02:12.220 

00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:18.170
