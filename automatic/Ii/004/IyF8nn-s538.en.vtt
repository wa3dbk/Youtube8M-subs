from<00:02:45.319> that<00:02:45.890> it<00:02:46.760> made<00:02:47.239> her<00:02:47.480> face<00:02:47.720> a<00:02:47.750> little<00:02:48.200> more

00:02:49.559 --> 00:02:49.569 
from that it made her face a little more

00:02:49.569 --> 00:02:52.630 
from that it made her face a little more
oblong<00:02:50.590> which<00:02:51.590> I<00:02:51.709> kind<00:02:51.980> of<00:02:52.040> like<00:02:52.220> these<00:02:52.430> ones

00:02:52.630 --> 00:02:52.640 
oblong which I kind of like these ones

00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:55.300 
oblong which I kind of like these ones
better<00:02:53.000> and<00:02:53.750> then<00:02:54.440> this<00:02:54.620> one<00:02:54.680> I<00:02:54.890> went<00:02:55.190> with

00:02:55.300 --> 00:02:55.310 
better and then this one I went with

00:02:55.310 --> 00:02:57.250 
better and then this one I went with
this<00:02:55.459> smaller<00:02:55.880> one<00:02:56.000> that<00:02:56.420> I<00:02:56.540> used<00:02:56.900> any<00:02:57.110> other

00:02:57.250 --> 00:02:57.260 
this smaller one that I used any other

00:02:57.260 --> 00:03:00.460 
this smaller one that I used any other
girls<00:02:57.709> and<00:02:58.700> I<00:02:59.510> think<00:02:59.720> that's<00:02:59.900> a<00:02:59.989> nice<00:03:00.170> size<00:03:00.410> for

00:03:00.460 --> 00:03:00.470 
girls and I think that's a nice size for

00:03:00.470 --> 00:03:03.190 
girls and I think that's a nice size for
her<00:03:01.180> except<00:03:02.180> I<00:03:02.269> have<00:03:02.420> to<00:03:02.540> stamp<00:03:02.780> it<00:03:02.930> over<00:03:03.170> a

00:03:03.190 --> 00:03:03.200 
her except I have to stamp it over a

00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:06.100 
her except I have to stamp it over a
little<00:03:03.380> bit<00:03:03.590> more<00:03:04.030> so<00:03:05.030> after<00:03:05.420> playing<00:03:05.780> around

00:03:06.100 --> 00:03:06.110 
little bit more so after playing around

00:03:06.110 --> 00:03:10.870 
little bit more so after playing around
with<00:03:06.290> them<00:03:06.579> I<00:03:07.579> decided<00:03:08.360> to<00:03:08.690> try<00:03:09.459> coloring<00:03:10.459> in

00:03:10.870 --> 00:03:10.880 
with them I decided to try coloring in

00:03:10.880 --> 00:03:13.120 
with them I decided to try coloring in
then<00:03:11.060> and<00:03:11.269> paper<00:03:11.870> pacing<00:03:12.380> and<00:03:12.560> see<00:03:12.829> how<00:03:12.950> they

00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:13.130 
then and paper pacing and see how they

00:03:13.130 --> 00:03:19.479 
then and paper pacing and see how they
looked<00:03:14.109> so<00:03:15.109> this<00:03:15.620> is<00:03:15.850> the<00:03:17.680> larger<00:03:18.680> face<00:03:18.980> which

00:03:19.479 --> 00:03:19.489 
looked so this is the larger face which

00:03:19.489 --> 00:03:24.330 
looked so this is the larger face which
is<00:03:19.700> this<00:03:19.850> one<00:03:20.060> here<00:03:20.690> this<00:03:21.639> style<00:03:22.639> of<00:03:22.940> face<00:03:23.209> and

00:03:24.330 --> 00:03:24.340 
is this one here this style of face and

00:03:24.340 --> 00:03:29.860 
is this one here this style of face and
I<00:03:25.340> believed<00:03:25.930> place<00:03:26.930> this<00:03:27.560> size<00:03:28.690> through<00:03:29.690> the

00:03:29.860 --> 00:03:29.870 
I believed place this size through the

00:03:29.870 --> 00:03:37.030 
I believed place this size through the
seven<00:03:33.220> that<00:03:34.220> stance<00:03:35.170> but<00:03:36.170> I<00:03:36.230> use<00:03:36.470> this<00:03:36.650> one<00:03:36.889> and

00:03:37.030 --> 00:03:37.040 
seven that stance but I use this one and

00:03:37.040 --> 00:03:40.920 
seven that stance but I use this one and
it<00:03:37.130> makes<00:03:37.370> her<00:03:37.609> look<00:03:37.639> like<00:03:37.850> a<00:03:38.510> little<00:03:39.410> girl<00:03:39.650> she

00:03:40.920 --> 00:03:40.930 
it makes her look like a little girl she

00:03:40.930 --> 00:03:44.590 
it makes her look like a little girl she
turned<00:03:41.930> out<00:03:42.109> pretty<00:03:42.260> cute<00:03:43.030> please<00:03:44.030> excuse<00:03:44.450> the

00:03:44.590 --> 00:03:44.600 
turned out pretty cute please excuse the

00:03:44.600 --> 00:03:46.240 
turned out pretty cute please excuse the
coloring<00:03:45.079> I'm<00:03:45.200> still<00:03:45.500> learning<00:03:45.650> on<00:03:45.950> a<00:03:45.980> color

00:03:46.240 --> 00:03:46.250 
coloring I'm still learning on a color

00:03:46.250 --> 00:03:49.479 
coloring I'm still learning on a color
in<00:03:46.519> the<00:03:46.639> hair<00:03:46.850> and<00:03:47.150> stuff<00:03:47.859> but<00:03:48.859> I<00:03:48.920> paper<00:03:49.190> pasted

00:03:49.479 --> 00:03:49.489 
in the hair and stuff but I paper pasted

00:03:49.489 --> 00:03:51.910 
in the hair and stuff but I paper pasted
her<00:03:49.639> dress<00:03:49.910> and<00:03:50.359> this<00:03:51.170> time<00:03:51.410> I<00:03:51.440> didn't<00:03:51.739> pop<00:03:51.889> up

00:03:51.910 --> 00:03:51.920 
her dress and this time I didn't pop up

00:03:51.920 --> 00:03:54.190 
her dress and this time I didn't pop up
the<00:03:52.340> pockets<00:03:52.880> I<00:03:53.030> just<00:03:53.269> placed<00:03:53.630> it<00:03:53.870> straight

00:03:54.190 --> 00:03:54.200 
the pockets I just placed it straight

00:03:54.200 --> 00:03:57.759 
the pockets I just placed it straight
down<00:03:54.609> and<00:03:55.609> then<00:03:56.540> there's<00:03:57.109> her<00:03:57.260> little<00:03:57.290> feet

00:03:57.759 --> 00:03:57.769 
down and then there's her little feet

00:03:57.769 --> 00:04:02.860 
down and then there's her little feet
put<00:03:58.489> a<00:03:58.519> bling<00:03:58.790> on<00:03:59.000> her<00:03:59.319> on<00:04:00.319> her<00:04:00.500> feet<00:04:00.709> there<00:04:01.870> and

00:04:02.860 --> 00:04:02.870 
put a bling on her on her feet there and

00:04:02.870 --> 00:04:05.020 
put a bling on her on her feet there and
so<00:04:03.349> that's<00:04:03.560> what<00:04:04.190> she<00:04:04.430> looks<00:04:04.639> like<00:04:04.730> with<00:04:05.000> a

00:04:05.020 --> 00:04:05.030 
so that's what she looks like with a

00:04:05.030 --> 00:04:09.970 
so that's what she looks like with a
face<00:04:05.359> and<00:04:07.030> I<00:04:08.030> thought<00:04:08.209> that<00:04:08.269> looked<00:04:08.690> like<00:04:08.980> you

00:04:09.970 --> 00:04:09.980 
face and I thought that looked like you

00:04:09.980 --> 00:04:14.349 
face and I thought that looked like you
know<00:04:10.099> a<00:04:10.459> preteen<00:04:11.150> or<00:04:12.280> little<00:04:13.280> girl<00:04:13.489> so<00:04:14.120> then<00:04:14.269> I

00:04:14.349 --> 00:04:14.359 
know a preteen or little girl so then I

00:04:14.359 --> 00:04:16.029 
know a preteen or little girl so then I
wanted<00:04:14.720> to<00:04:14.930> make<00:04:15.200> her<00:04:15.380> look<00:04:15.560> a<00:04:15.680> little<00:04:15.829> bit

00:04:16.029 --> 00:04:16.039 
wanted to make her look a little bit

00:04:16.039 --> 00:04:19.990 
wanted to make her look a little bit
older<00:04:16.720> so<00:04:17.720> I<00:04:17.750> used<00:04:18.019> the<00:04:18.220> older<00:04:19.220> looking<00:04:19.519> face

00:04:19.990 --> 00:04:20.000 
older so I used the older looking face

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:23.950 
older so I used the older looking face
which<00:04:20.090> was<00:04:20.299> this<00:04:20.480> one<00:04:20.750> here<00:04:21.200> and<00:04:22.240> I<00:04:23.240> decided<00:04:23.780> to

00:04:23.950 --> 00:04:23.960 
which was this one here and I decided to

00:04:23.960 --> 00:04:27.490 
which was this one here and I decided to
try<00:04:24.230> something<00:04:24.260> with<00:04:24.920> her<00:04:25.040> hair<00:04:25.310> and<00:04:26.350> make<00:04:27.350> her

00:04:27.490 --> 00:04:27.500 
try something with her hair and make her

00:04:27.500 --> 00:04:30.930 
try something with her hair and make her
look<00:04:27.680> a<00:04:27.830> lot<00:04:27.980> more<00:04:28.250> like<00:04:28.640> the<00:04:29.240> kids<00:04:29.510> today<00:04:29.750> and

00:04:30.930 --> 00:04:30.940 
look a lot more like the kids today and

00:04:30.940 --> 00:04:34.350 
look a lot more like the kids today and
so<00:04:31.940> I<00:04:31.970> added<00:04:32.270> a<00:04:32.510> little<00:04:32.540> purple<00:04:33.140> in<00:04:33.590> her<00:04:33.890> hair

00:04:34.350 --> 00:04:34.360 
so I added a little purple in her hair

00:04:34.360 --> 00:04:36.880 
so I added a little purple in her hair
some<00:04:35.360> purple<00:04:35.690> streaks<00:04:36.020> throughout<00:04:36.440> her<00:04:36.620> hair

00:04:36.880 --> 00:04:36.890 
some purple streaks throughout her hair

00:04:36.890 --> 00:04:39.850 
some purple streaks throughout her hair
and<00:04:37.670> this<00:04:38.210> is<00:04:38.390> what<00:04:38.540> she<00:04:38.570> looks<00:04:38.930> like<00:04:39.020> with

00:04:39.850 --> 00:04:39.860 
and this is what she looks like with

00:04:39.860 --> 00:04:42.850 
and this is what she looks like with
that<00:04:40.070> face<00:04:41.050> and<00:04:42.050> I<00:04:42.170> thought<00:04:42.350> she<00:04:42.530> turned<00:04:42.740> out

00:04:42.850 --> 00:04:42.860
