00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.580
 hello everyone with you daisy today I want 

00:00:03.060 --> 00:00:07.319
 make a review of manicure tools 

00:00:04.580 --> 00:00:11.340
 loyal steelx link to this company 

00:00:07.319 --> 00:00:12.900
 add in infobox under video link from 

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:14.759
 Ukraine I was 12 days 

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:18.119
 the set was packed branded package 

00:00:14.759 --> 00:00:20.520
 cardboard box loved the style 

00:00:18.119 --> 00:00:22.769
 packaging confess I think a lover 

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:25.019
 beautiful packs the thing is that 

00:00:22.769 --> 00:00:27.510
 steel they are decorated like a pattern of 

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:31.380
 a piece or scissors but this is my personal bzik 

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:33.480
 do not pay attention to boost alex 

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:34.950
 quite a large variety of colors and with 

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:37.230
 manicure set rates 

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:39.930
 so I could find one that 

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:43.550
 satisfied my taste of course it is 

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:43.550
 little flowers in the main daisies 

00:00:44.810 --> 00:00:50.440
 loved that the sets are decorated 

00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:54.290
 beautifully both outside and inside and 

00:00:50.440 --> 00:00:56.990
 Now about the composition of my glass set 

00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:59.390
 nail file beautiful neat file 

00:00:56.990 --> 00:01:01.370
 framed in pink color carefully 

00:00:59.390 --> 00:01:01.880
 Impact on the nail I did not grow it 

00:01:01.370 --> 00:01:04.610
 edge 

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:06.320
 but she is very small of course and possible 

00:01:04.610 --> 00:01:09.020
 treat as a nail file 

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:12.700
 worn in her purse but she's very fragile 

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:12.700
 for me this is definitely not an option 

00:01:18.220 --> 00:01:23.840
 further pusher has two nozzles from 

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:25.880
 stainless steel on one side this 

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:28.460
 cuticle scapula with 

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:31.970
 the other is a hatchet to remove psy riga 

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:33.740
 skin that grows to the nail all 

00:01:31.970 --> 00:01:35.900
 metal pushers that i 

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:38.420
 used before were heavy 

00:01:35.900 --> 00:01:40.610
 uncomfortable the main thing was scratching the nail 

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:43.070
 the plate therefore pushed aside 

00:01:40.610 --> 00:01:43.880
 preferably plastic with rubber 

00:01:43.070 --> 00:01:45.650
 tipped 

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:48.710
 but that was before trying it 

00:01:45.650 --> 00:01:50.090
 the pusher had no cutting edges 

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:52.340
 scratch the surface 

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:55.480
 but in spite of it cleans well 

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:55.480
 nail plate 

00:02:00.859 --> 00:02:07.140
 nail scissors fingernails i don't 

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:08.280
 I cut them off, but I willingly used them. 

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:11.459
 for toenails 

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:12.989
 blade length 22 millimeters 

00:02:11.459 --> 00:02:17.090
 fine sharpened 

00:02:12.989 --> 00:02:17.090
 good and clean length without problems 

00:02:27.350 --> 00:02:32.520
 nail scissors 

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:34.620
 many people know that I do not cut the cuticle 

00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:37.530
 so it was possible to decide that they are to me 

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:39.330
 needlessly but it's not at all the topic 

00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:41.000
 probably use more often than others 

00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:42.930
 tools from this set 

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:44.940
 high-quality tool sharpening 

00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:47.550
 allowed me to easily cut the tape 

00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:49.530
 for design left hand in front of me this 

00:02:47.550 --> 00:02:51.810
 a huge plus because earlier I 

00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:54.180
 attracted to this occupation her husband and he did not 

00:02:51.810 --> 00:02:55.560
 I love it so here are these scissors I 

00:02:54.180 --> 00:02:59.570
 I use arcy 

00:02:55.560 --> 00:02:59.570
 and now they are no substitute for me 

00:03:02.470 --> 00:03:08.620
 nagging burrs and nippers from steel 

00:03:06.130 --> 00:03:11.290
 do not pull does not catch and do not tear when 

00:03:08.620 --> 00:03:12.940
 deburring making strong 

00:03:11.290 --> 00:03:14.800
 contrast compared to my old ones 

00:03:12.940 --> 00:03:18.190
 which are in one price 

00:03:14.800 --> 00:03:20.590
 categories hand grip strength mean what 

00:03:18.190 --> 00:03:23.730
 I really like them now 

00:03:20.590 --> 00:03:23.730
 use manicure 

00:03:28.380 --> 00:03:34.270
 pliers flat professional they have 

00:03:31.600 --> 00:03:36.910
 14 long flat cutting edges 

00:03:34.270 --> 00:03:39.280
 millimeter has a very comfortable handle 

00:03:36.910 --> 00:03:42.190
 thanks to which the wire cutters sit firmly 

00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:45.130
 in hand unfortunately remove the burrs of this 

00:03:42.190 --> 00:03:48.209
 model could not make friends 

00:03:45.130 --> 00:03:48.209
 with flat edges 

00:03:54.360 --> 00:03:58.670
 we 

00:03:55.850 --> 00:04:01.550
 eyebrow tweezers straight working edges 

00:03:58.670 --> 00:04:02.840
 perfectly grab hair does not cut and 

00:04:01.550 --> 00:04:05.150
 do not scratch the skin 

00:04:02.840 --> 00:04:07.580
 I used it as a direct 

00:04:05.150 --> 00:04:08.510
 purpose of such nail art for example 

00:04:07.580 --> 00:04:12.280
 water stickers 

00:04:08.510 --> 00:04:15.350
 very handy and useful tool and 

00:04:12.280 --> 00:04:17.410
 whole set pretty at the table the most 

00:04:15.350 --> 00:04:20.390
 acceptable price-quality relationship 

00:04:17.410 --> 00:04:24.010
 so feel free to recommend it to those who do not 

00:04:20.390 --> 00:04:26.720
 doesn't care what his nails look like 

00:04:24.010 --> 00:04:29.210
