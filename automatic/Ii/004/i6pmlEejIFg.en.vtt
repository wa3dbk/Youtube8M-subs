in<00:00:36.420> my<00:00:36.450> shop<00:00:38.870> then<00:00:39.870> the<00:00:41.300> drum<00:00:42.300> is<00:00:43.399> made<00:00:44.399> out<00:00:44.610> of

00:00:44.810 --> 00:00:44.820 
in my shop then the drum is made out of

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:49.729 
in my shop then the drum is made out of
MDF<00:00:45.200> it<00:00:46.200> is<00:00:47.160> just<00:00:47.910> disc<00:00:48.270> screwed<00:00:49.110> together<00:00:49.230> and

00:00:49.729 --> 00:00:49.739 
MDF it is just disc screwed together and

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:53.000 
MDF it is just disc screwed together and
I<00:00:50.280> have<00:00:50.430> trued<00:00:50.850> up<00:00:50.940> the<00:00:51.090> drum<00:00:51.329> now<00:00:51.469> and<00:00:52.469> run<00:00:52.770> I

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:53.010 
I have trued up the drum now and run I

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:55.639 
I have trued up the drum now and run I
have<00:00:53.219> pipe<00:00:54.180> clamps<00:00:54.629> holding<00:00:54.719> it<00:00:54.989> together<00:00:55.140> and

00:00:55.639 --> 00:00:55.649 
have pipe clamps holding it together and

00:00:55.649 --> 00:00:59.599 
have pipe clamps holding it together and
I<00:00:56.550> had<00:00:56.670> a<00:00:56.809> Miller<00:00:57.809> groove<00:00:58.230> into<00:00:58.680> the<00:00:59.129> drum<00:00:59.340> so

00:00:59.599 --> 00:00:59.609 
I had a Miller groove into the drum so

00:00:59.609 --> 00:01:01.549 
I had a Miller groove into the drum so
they<00:00:59.730> could<00:00:59.969> clear<00:01:00.210> or<00:01:00.660> not<00:01:00.870> the<00:01:00.989> drum<00:01:01.199> but<00:01:01.410> the

00:01:01.549 --> 00:01:01.559 
they could clear or not the drum but the

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:07.100 
they could clear or not the drum but the
dust<00:01:01.949> dusted<00:01:02.609> and<00:01:04.700> pipe<00:01:05.700> clamps<00:01:06.180> hold<00:01:06.750> the

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:07.110 
dust dusted and pipe clamps hold the

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:11.359 
dust dusted and pipe clamps hold the
sandpaper<00:01:07.680> onto<00:01:08.130> the<00:01:08.250> drum<00:01:08.490> and<00:01:10.369> that's

00:01:11.359 --> 00:01:11.369 
sandpaper onto the drum and that's

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:13.910 
sandpaper onto the drum and that's
worked<00:01:11.580> out<00:01:11.729> pretty<00:01:11.909> well<00:01:12.030> and<00:01:12.890> originally<00:01:13.890> I

00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:13.920 
worked out pretty well and originally I

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:16.190 
worked out pretty well and originally I
did<00:01:14.220> have<00:01:14.369> clips<00:01:14.760> as<00:01:14.970> you<00:01:15.150> can<00:01:15.299> see<00:01:15.810> the<00:01:15.960> gap

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:16.200 
did have clips as you can see the gap

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:19.609 
did have clips as you can see the gap
here<00:01:16.470> now<00:01:17.060> but<00:01:18.060> the<00:01:18.299> holes<00:01:18.810> failed<00:01:19.259> because<00:01:19.530> I

00:01:19.609 --> 00:01:19.619 
here now but the holes failed because I

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:21.380 
here now but the holes failed because I
just<00:01:19.830> tapped<00:01:20.100> them<00:01:20.340> straight<00:01:20.820> into<00:01:21.090> the<00:01:21.210> wood

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:21.390 
just tapped them straight into the wood

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:29.260 
just tapped them straight into the wood
and<00:01:23.030> it<00:01:24.030> Sam's<00:01:24.540> pretty<00:01:24.840> nice<00:01:25.490> so<00:01:26.490> I<00:01:27.350> have<00:01:28.350> two

00:01:29.260 --> 00:01:29.270 
and it Sam's pretty nice so I have two

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:31.880 
and it Sam's pretty nice so I have two

one<00:01:32.490> here<00:01:32.759> and<00:01:32.970> one<00:01:33.900> here<00:01:34.070> they<00:01:35.070> are<00:01:35.460> a<00:01:35.880> 2-1

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:36.780 
one here and one here they are a 2-1

one here and one here they are a 2-1
inch<00:01:36.960> shaft<00:01:37.740> I<00:01:38.009> have<00:01:38.250> from<00:01:39.150> the<00:01:39.299> surplus

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:39.750 
inch shaft I have from the surplus

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:42.770 
inch shaft I have from the surplus
Center<00:01:40.140> and<00:01:40.579> I<00:01:41.579> would<00:01:42.150> definitely<00:01:42.570> go<00:01:42.750> with

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:42.780 
Center and I would definitely go with

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:44.090 
Center and I would definitely go with
the<00:01:42.960> one<00:01:43.710> inch

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:44.100 
the one inch

the one inch
do<00:01:44.490> not<00:01:44.700> go<00:01:45.270> less<00:01:45.540> you<00:01:45.960> will<00:01:46.170> bend<00:01:46.530> it<00:01:46.920> I<00:01:47.360> bent

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:48.360 
do not go less you will bend it I bent

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:50.240 
do not go less you will bend it I bent
it<00:01:48.450> using<00:01:48.840> pipe<00:01:49.049> clamps<00:01:49.500> I<00:01:49.619> have<00:01:49.770> over<00:01:50.070> there

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:50.250 
it using pipe clamps I have over there

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:53.210 
it using pipe clamps I have over there
and<00:01:50.520> just<00:01:51.450> whenever<00:01:51.750> I<00:01:51.990> glued<00:01:52.259> it<00:01:52.380> up<00:01:52.530> just<00:01:52.920> the

00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:53.220 
and just whenever I glued it up just the

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:55.219 
and just whenever I glued it up just the
pressure<00:01:53.520> from<00:01:53.790> the<00:01:53.970> pipe<00:01:54.149> clamps<00:01:54.600> like<00:01:54.720> bit

00:01:55.219 --> 00:01:55.229 
pressure from the pipe clamps like bit

00:01:55.229 --> 00:01:58.760 
pressure from the pipe clamps like bit
just<00:01:55.380> bent<00:01:55.619> and<00:01:55.799> that<00:01:56.299> was<00:01:57.299> a<00:01:57.329> 5/8<00:01:58.110> shaft<00:01:58.530> this

00:01:58.760 --> 00:01:58.770 
just bent and that was a 5/8 shaft this

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:03.139 
just bent and that was a 5/8 shaft this
is<00:01:58.979> my<00:01:59.399> second<00:01:59.820> drum<00:02:01.280> here<00:02:02.280> is<00:02:02.399> a<00:02:02.430> four-step

00:02:03.139 --> 00:02:03.149 
is my second drum here is a four-step

is my second drum here is a four-step
pulley<00:02:03.479> I<00:02:04.280> got<00:02:05.280> off<00:02:05.460> of<00:02:05.490> ebay<00:02:05.850> and<00:02:06.409> a<00:02:07.409> half<00:02:07.740> inch

00:02:07.999 --> 00:02:08.009 
pulley I got off of ebay and a half inch

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:10.759

the<00:02:11.769> motor<00:02:12.040> is<00:02:12.370> a<00:02:12.400> one<00:02:13.239> horsepower<00:02:13.950> 1750<00:02:14.950> rpm

00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:14.980 
the motor is a one horsepower 1750 rpm

00:02:14.980 --> 00:02:17.699 
the motor is a one horsepower 1750 rpm
and<00:02:15.610> I<00:02:15.939> have<00:02:16.060> another<00:02:16.299> four<00:02:16.870> step<00:02:17.140> pulley<00:02:17.409> I

00:02:17.699 --> 00:02:17.709 
and I have another four step pulley I

00:02:17.709 --> 00:02:21.990 
and I have another four step pulley I
probably<00:02:18.640> don't<00:02:19.120> need<00:02:19.329> to<00:02:19.510> go<00:02:19.750> with<00:02:20.019> a<00:02:21.000> four

00:02:21.990 --> 00:02:22.000 
probably don't need to go with a four

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:24.630 
probably don't need to go with a four
step<00:02:22.299> pulley<00:02:22.599> I<00:02:22.900> think<00:02:23.409> next<00:02:23.920> time<00:02:24.220> if<00:02:24.400> I<00:02:24.519> ever

00:02:24.630 --> 00:02:24.640 
step pulley I think next time if I ever

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:26.339 
step pulley I think next time if I ever
were<00:02:24.849> to<00:02:24.909> build<00:02:25.120> another<00:02:25.390> one<00:02:25.599> I<00:02:25.810> just<00:02:25.959> have

00:02:26.339 --> 00:02:26.349 
were to build another one I just have

00:02:26.349 --> 00:02:28.349 
were to build another one I just have
like<00:02:26.530> a<00:02:26.560> five<00:02:27.099> inch<00:02:27.370> pulley<00:02:27.549> on<00:02:27.760> the<00:02:27.790> top<00:02:28.090> and

00:02:28.349 --> 00:02:28.359 
like a five inch pulley on the top and

00:02:28.359 --> 00:02:32.809 
like a five inch pulley on the top and
maybe<00:02:28.959> a<00:02:29.129> two<00:02:30.129> and<00:02:30.280> a<00:02:30.310> half<00:02:30.489> on<00:02:30.730> the<00:02:30.849> bottom

00:02:32.809 --> 00:02:32.819 
maybe a two and a half on the bottom

00:02:32.819 --> 00:02:35.630 
maybe a two and a half on the bottom
that<00:02:33.819> that<00:02:34.180> is<00:02:34.359> really<00:02:34.689> what<00:02:34.870> you<00:02:34.900> need<00:02:35.170> I

00:02:35.630 --> 00:02:35.640 
that that is really what you need I

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:39.869

geared down quite a bit here to get

00:05:09.069 --> 00:05:11.730 
geared down quite a bit here to get
another<00:05:09.310> shot<00:05:10.169> probably<00:05:11.169> didn't<00:05:11.380> need<00:05:11.500> to<00:05:11.560> go

00:05:11.730 --> 00:05:11.740 
another shot probably didn't need to go

00:05:11.740 --> 00:05:14.730 
another shot probably didn't need to go
that<00:05:11.979> much<00:05:12.250> but<00:05:13.210> now<00:05:13.690> whenever<00:05:14.080> I<00:05:14.169> run<00:05:14.440> a<00:05:14.470> board

00:05:14.730 --> 00:05:14.740 
that much but now whenever I run a board

00:05:14.740 --> 00:05:17.550 
that much but now whenever I run a board
through<00:05:14.979> it<00:05:15.219> doesn't<00:05:15.669> stall<00:05:16.479> because<00:05:17.020> before

00:05:17.550 --> 00:05:17.560 
through it doesn't stall because before

00:05:17.560 --> 00:05:21.209 
through it doesn't stall because before
I'd<00:05:17.889> have<00:05:18.509> smaller<00:05:19.509> sprocket<00:05:19.960> you<00:05:20.380> know<00:05:21.159> it

00:05:21.209 --> 00:05:21.219 
I'd have smaller sprocket you know it

00:05:21.219 --> 00:05:24.600 
I'd have smaller sprocket you know it
was<00:05:21.340> about<00:05:21.879> that<00:05:22.210> size<00:05:22.509> and<00:05:22.870> it<00:05:23.740> would<00:05:23.889> just<00:05:23.949> it

00:05:24.600 --> 00:05:24.610 
was about that size and it would just it

00:05:24.610 --> 00:05:26.850 
was about that size and it would just it
would<00:05:25.270> just<00:05:25.509> basically<00:05:25.719> completely<00:05:26.469> stop

00:05:26.850 --> 00:05:26.860 
would just basically completely stop

00:05:26.860 --> 00:05:29.070 
would just basically completely stop
this<00:05:27.669> motor<00:05:28.000> at<00:05:28.180> the<00:05:28.300> slowest<00:05:28.719> settings

00:05:29.070 --> 00:05:29.080 
this motor at the slowest settings

00:05:29.080 --> 00:05:32.540 
this motor at the slowest settings
doesn't<00:05:29.530> have<00:05:29.740> the<00:05:29.979> torque<00:05:30.630> that<00:05:31.630> I<00:05:31.659> need<00:05:32.050> and

00:05:32.540 --> 00:05:32.550 
doesn't have the torque that I need and

00:05:32.550 --> 00:05:35.700 
doesn't have the torque that I need and
then<00:05:33.550> down<00:05:34.240> here<00:05:34.270> I<00:05:34.840> have<00:05:35.110> a<00:05:35.199> circuit<00:05:35.590> board

00:05:35.700 --> 00:05:35.710 
then down here I have a circuit board

00:05:35.710 --> 00:05:43.050 
then down here I have a circuit board
part<00:05:36.069> and<00:05:38.940> the<00:05:39.940> switches<00:05:41.430> these<00:05:42.430> are<00:05:42.669> -<00:05:43.029> a

00:05:43.050 --> 00:05:43.060 
part and the switches these are - a

00:05:43.060 --> 00:05:44.939 
part and the switches these are - a
replacement<00:05:43.569> switches<00:05:44.199> for<00:05:44.500> my<00:05:44.680> drill<00:05:44.919> press

00:05:44.939 --> 00:05:44.949 
replacement switches for my drill press

00:05:44.949 --> 00:05:47.719 
replacement switches for my drill press
actually<00:05:45.400> and<00:05:45.880> this<00:05:46.509> one<00:05:46.659> turns<00:05:46.900> on<00:05:47.050> the<00:05:47.169> drum

00:05:47.719 --> 00:05:47.729 
actually and this one turns on the drum

00:05:47.729 --> 00:05:51.149 
actually and this one turns on the drum
these<00:05:48.729> three<00:05:49.630> are<00:05:49.840> for<00:05:50.409> the<00:05:50.529> conveyor<00:05:50.889> this

00:05:51.149 --> 00:05:51.159 
these three are for the conveyor this

00:05:51.159 --> 00:05:53.550 
these three are for the conveyor this
sends<00:05:51.490> power<00:05:51.699> to<00:05:51.909> the<00:05:52.029> circuit<00:05:52.360> board<00:05:52.599> this

00:05:53.550 --> 00:05:53.560 
sends power to the circuit board this

00:05:53.560 --> 00:05:55.709 
sends power to the circuit board this
one<00:05:53.770> sounds<00:05:53.979> pirate<00:05:54.430> of<00:05:54.550> the<00:05:54.610> motor<00:05:54.880> and<00:05:55.150> this

00:05:55.709 --> 00:05:55.719 
one sounds pirate of the motor and this

00:05:55.719 --> 00:05:58.140 
one sounds pirate of the motor and this
is<00:05:55.900> where<00:05:56.050> you<00:05:56.199> adjust<00:05:56.319> your<00:05:56.740> speed<00:05:57.150> it's

00:05:58.140 --> 00:05:58.150 
is where you adjust your speed it's

00:05:58.150 --> 00:06:02.240 
is where you adjust your speed it's
called<00:05:58.479> a<00:05:58.569> putana<00:05:59.110> meter<00:05:59.380> I<00:05:59.469> believe<00:05:59.860> and

00:06:02.240 --> 00:06:02.250 
called a putana meter I believe and

00:06:02.250 --> 00:06:05.159 
called a putana meter I believe and
today<00:06:03.250> I'll<00:06:03.430> have<00:06:03.460> a<00:06:03.880> video<00:06:04.180> of<00:06:04.690> this<00:06:05.110> thing

00:06:05.159 --> 00:06:05.169 
today I'll have a video of this thing

00:06:05.169 --> 00:06:10.830 
today I'll have a video of this thing
actually<00:06:05.830> running<00:06:06.069> and<00:06:07.349> I<00:06:09.300> have<00:06:10.300> a<00:06:10.360> whole<00:06:10.599> list

00:06:10.830 --> 00:06:10.840 
actually running and I have a whole list

00:06:10.840 --> 00:06:12.649 
actually running and I have a whole list
over<00:06:11.139> here<00:06:11.380> of<00:06:11.440> what<00:06:11.590> I<00:06:11.620> need<00:06:11.860> to<00:06:11.949> talk<00:06:12.159> about

00:06:12.649 --> 00:06:12.659 
over here of what I need to talk about

00:06:12.659 --> 00:06:14.700 
over here of what I need to talk about
believe<00:06:13.659> I<00:06:13.779> covered<00:06:14.139> everything

00:06:14.700 --> 00:06:14.710

quite<00:06:25.690> a<00:06:25.720> number<00:06:25.930> of<00:06:26.080> problems<00:06:27.090> before<00:06:28.090> I<00:06:28.120> had

00:06:28.379 --> 00:06:28.389 
quite a number of problems before I had

00:06:28.389 --> 00:06:31.770 
quite a number of problems before I had
a<00:06:28.830> table<00:06:29.830> this<00:06:30.220> isn't<00:06:30.550> this<00:06:30.910> is<00:06:31.060> my<00:06:31.270> second

there's quite a number of drum Sanders

00:07:02.680 --> 00:07:05.820 
there's quite a number of drum Sanders
on<00:07:02.889> there<00:07:03.760> that<00:07:04.660> have<00:07:04.900> like<00:07:05.139> the<00:07:05.260> four<00:07:05.470> column

00:07:05.820 --> 00:07:05.830 
on there that have like the four column

00:07:05.830 --> 00:07:07.980 
on there that have like the four column
lifts<00:07:06.040> just<00:07:06.820> make<00:07:07.060> sure<00:07:07.240> you<00:07:07.419> have<00:07:07.600> some<00:07:07.840> kind

00:07:07.980 --> 00:07:07.990 
lifts just make sure you have some kind

00:07:07.990 --> 00:07:10.500 
lifts just make sure you have some kind
of<00:07:08.229> bearing<00:07:08.620> or<00:07:08.770> bushing<00:07:09.160> at<00:07:09.310> the<00:07:09.430> top<00:07:09.639> and<00:07:09.910> a

00:07:10.500 --> 00:07:10.510 
of bearing or bushing at the top and a

and<00:07:14.340> so<00:07:15.340> you<00:07:15.430> can<00:07:15.580> see<00:07:15.789> here<00:07:16.139> mine<00:07:17.139> is<00:07:17.669> turning

00:07:18.659 --> 00:07:18.669 
and so you can see here mine is turning

00:07:18.669 --> 00:07:22.170 
and so you can see here mine is turning
easier<00:07:19.060> now<00:07:19.270> it's<00:07:19.900> a<00:07:20.110> little<00:07:20.979> bit<00:07:21.250> hard<00:07:21.490> still

00:07:22.170 --> 00:07:22.180 
easier now it's a little bit hard still

00:07:22.180 --> 00:07:25.800 
easier now it's a little bit hard still
and<00:07:22.449> I<00:07:23.289> even<00:07:23.470> have<00:07:23.740> it<00:07:23.979> geared<00:07:24.729> down<00:07:25.090> right

00:07:25.800 --> 00:07:25.810 
and I even have it geared down right

00:07:25.810 --> 00:07:31.140 
and I even have it geared down right
hearing<00:07:26.139> right<00:07:26.289> here<00:07:27.060> so<00:07:28.950> this<00:07:29.950> was<00:07:30.370> part<00:07:30.789> one

00:07:31.140 --> 00:07:31.150 
hearing right here so this was part one
