00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.359
 Hmm, the ace 

00:00:04.410 --> 00:00:08.630
 Hello friends, I'm a war male welcome. 

00:00:06.359 --> 00:00:11.370
 to another channel video and today 

00:00:08.630 --> 00:00:13.679
 You do not want to shut up. 

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:16.080
 After all, what took my order? 

00:00:13.679 --> 00:00:22.769
 iphone drown is what we people 

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:25.320
 Now, tell me a quick summary of my 

00:00:22.769 --> 00:00:26.849
 iphone 5 s cell phone fell into the water 

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:28.830
 inside the sea water 

00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:31.050
 I tried anyway to save the 

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:32.880
 Bug, but it did not work. 

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:34.620
 I want to thank everyone who came in. 

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:35.160
 In the video they made comments trying to 

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:37.290
 to help 

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:38.820
 some comments were very helpful 

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:41.190
 others were very funny 

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:43.200
 jackson santana santos he speaks here that 

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:45.629
 I have to take apart and clean dry 

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:47.879
 with isopropyl alcohol is not simple 

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:49.590
 so open an iphone and do not have this 

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:51.510
 that other cell phones have 

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:53.520
 You open behind to exchange 

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:54.690
 battery for example he is not so he 

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:58.230
 it's all closed 

00:00:54.690 --> 00:01:00.930
 rafael chicago's tip was kamura 

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:04.439
 this is not chicago she did not fall camaro 

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:07.740
 camaro tuschi camargo tip of rafael 

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:09.240
 bought fake nokia eichman buy one 

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:11.340
 iphone 6 for me 

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:13.799
 Another interesting tip was waiting more 

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:15.600
 a little and against the iphone 6 

00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:17.009
 the detail is the plan that I have been 

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:19.350
 give a new phone 

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:22.680
 in the iphone 6 case when it's released 

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:24.390
 I have to return my iphone 5 is 

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:26.909
 received the iphone 6 

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:30.840
 so I would have to buy an iphone 5 is 

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:32.970
 same as my iphone 5 s 32 gb 

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:35.159
 zé paulo says the following if the iphone 

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:37.140
 you probably have the guarantee 

00:01:35.159 --> 00:01:38.700
 will win a new one because Apple does not 

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:40.439
 fix the iphones 

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:42.450
 this is true they are taken to 

00:01:40.439 --> 00:01:44.220
 recycling you see a new case he 

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:46.740
 I'm under warranty I think the 

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:49.079
 warranty does not cover water but I say to 

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:52.079
 You, what happened only ends here. 

00:01:49.079 --> 00:01:54.360
 dirty mouse has to take apart clean 

00:01:52.079 --> 00:01:57.119
 all with isopropyl alcohol solution 

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:57.930
 brush and put everything together again and 

00:01:57.119 --> 00:01:59.460
 ready 

00:01:57.930 --> 00:02:01.439
 As I already said the iphone does not open 

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:03.810
 like the other cell phones come the mouse 

00:02:01.439 --> 00:02:07.530
 male again and told me the following handle 

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:10.590
 the finnet and scratch the stone until it becomes 

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:12.690
 very small screwdriver so 

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:13.680
 you can remove the two 

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:15.480
 low 

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:17.640
 sure that the mouse is capable of doing something 

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:19.500
 My smartphone is the new one. 

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:22.769
 I channel my car in the pool but no 

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:24.569
 had nothing was the nokia until joão 

00:02:22.769 --> 00:02:27.090
 Carlos that he had the same problem only 

00:02:24.569 --> 00:02:29.129
 that he had 1500 photos that were from 

00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:31.200
 work and he could not lose then 

00:02:29.129 --> 00:02:33.120
 managed to recover but paid a lot 

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:34.560
 high so it was not my case 

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:37.829
 here are the people talking about each other 

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:40.859
 phones like the galaxy s 5 that do not have 

00:02:37.829 --> 00:02:43.409
 this problem that he is finally hard 

00:02:40.859 --> 00:02:45.450
 The more you put in the water it takes 

00:02:43.409 --> 00:02:48.209
 more to drown if you can save 

00:02:45.450 --> 00:02:51.540
 and anti on corner to corner to other 

00:02:48.209 --> 00:02:53.970
 Come on, but here in Brazil there is 

00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:55.560
 product called dehumidifier 

00:02:53.970 --> 00:02:56.189
 cabinets and if I liked it was that I more 

00:02:55.560 --> 00:02:58.500
 liked it 

00:02:56.189 --> 00:03:00.000
 I did not have time to use it and you will know 

00:02:58.500 --> 00:03:01.439
 Because I'm going to get there, I remember. 

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:02.189
 That in Brazil I got to use this in 

00:03:01.439 --> 00:03:03.870
 my house 

00:03:02.189 --> 00:03:05.430
 here I have not found but I 

00:03:03.870 --> 00:03:07.950
 I found when I searched, too. 

00:03:05.430 --> 00:03:11.010
 have a little elephant something like that in 

00:03:07.950 --> 00:03:14.639
 in front of the other pink boxes that were 

00:03:11.010 --> 00:03:17.069
 blues is a zum-zum-zum is a business that 

00:03:14.639 --> 00:03:19.019
 into the closet and he takes the 

00:03:17.069 --> 00:03:20.519
 moisture inside the cabinet and you see that 

00:03:19.019 --> 00:03:22.849
 The water is getting in there and I 

00:03:20.519 --> 00:03:27.180
 I figured I'd take that dehumidifier. 

00:03:22.849 --> 00:03:30.030
 put a dipp locke larger bag put 

00:03:27.180 --> 00:03:32.189
 the cell phone on top close and leave it there 

00:03:30.030 --> 00:03:34.349
 to draw water from the apparatus 

00:03:32.189 --> 00:03:36.780
 I found it cool the chance to tip the best of 

00:03:34.349 --> 00:03:39.269
 all but fortunately I did not need 

00:03:36.780 --> 00:03:42.840
 To test none of this, what happened is that 

00:03:39.269 --> 00:03:45.030
 My wife made phone insurance. 

00:03:42.840 --> 00:03:46.829
 because my wife fuck Caetano my 

00:03:45.030 --> 00:03:48.720
 woman what the fuck 

00:03:46.829 --> 00:03:51.989
 the truth is that my phone is 

00:03:48.720 --> 00:03:54.090
 They are paid in 18 installments I think 

00:03:51.989 --> 00:03:56.189
 in this leasing system when there is a 

00:03:54.090 --> 00:03:59.340
 new cell phone I have the right to change 

00:03:56.189 --> 00:04:01.349
 i should old iphone and pick up the iphone 

00:03:59.340 --> 00:04:04.699
 new so for me it's not worth 

00:04:01.349 --> 00:04:07.079
 buy iphone 5 s new because the new 

00:04:04.699 --> 00:04:09.599
 unlocked think it cost 800 dollars 

00:04:07.079 --> 00:04:13.430
 to trigger insurance we had to 

00:04:09.599 --> 00:04:17.820
 pay 145 dollars 

00:04:13.430 --> 00:04:20.220

 I know that in Brazil the insurance for a 

00:04:24.700 --> 00:04:29.020
 This phone is very expensive so the 

00:04:27.040 --> 00:04:29.980
 Best advice I can give to 

00:04:29.020 --> 00:04:32.710

 phones when even the rain 

00:04:34.690 --> 00:04:38.140
