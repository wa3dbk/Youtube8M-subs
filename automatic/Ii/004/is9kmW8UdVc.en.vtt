00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:19.570 
constructive so my friend suggested we

00:00:19.570 --> 00:00:21.330 
constructive so my friend suggested we
build<00:00:19.750> a<00:00:19.840> tree<00:00:20.080> house<00:00:20.260> which<00:00:20.590> he<00:00:21.040> used<00:00:21.220> to

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:21.340 
build a tree house which he used to

00:00:21.340 --> 00:00:23.100 
build a tree house which he used to
inspire<00:00:21.850> us<00:00:22.030> with<00:00:22.210> tales<00:00:22.510> from<00:00:22.720> winning<00:00:23.020> his

younger<00:00:23.440> of<00:00:23.740> history<00:00:24.220> has<00:00:24.370> as<00:00:24.550> we<00:00:24.700> said<00:00:24.880> well

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:25.000 
younger of history has as we said well

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:26.700 
younger of history has as we said well
why<00:00:25.090> don't<00:00:25.270> we<00:00:25.300> do<00:00:25.450> this<00:00:25.570> now<00:00:25.810> even<00:00:26.650> though

00:00:26.700 --> 00:00:26.710 
why don't we do this now even though

00:00:26.710 --> 00:00:28.410 
why don't we do this now even though
we're<00:00:26.830> older<00:00:27.220> we<00:00:27.430> might<00:00:27.730> as<00:00:27.820> well<00:00:27.880> go<00:00:28.060> for<00:00:28.300> it

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:28.420 
we're older we might as well go for it

00:00:28.420 --> 00:00:31.680 
we're older we might as well go for it
and<00:00:28.570> so<00:00:29.560> so<00:00:30.130> we<00:00:30.220> decided<00:00:30.520> to<00:00:30.640> to<00:00:31.240> build<00:00:31.420> it<00:00:31.540> and

00:00:31.680 --> 00:00:31.690 
and so so we decided to to build it and

00:00:31.690 --> 00:00:34.230 
and so so we decided to to build it and
after<00:00:32.200> a<00:00:32.230> while<00:00:32.670> someone<00:00:33.670> suggested<00:00:34.180> that

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:34.240 
after a while someone suggested that

00:00:34.240 --> 00:00:35.010 
after a while someone suggested that
maybe<00:00:34.360> we<00:00:34.570> need<00:00:34.690> planning<00:00:34.930> permission

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:35.020 
maybe we need planning permission

00:00:35.020 --> 00:00:36.870 
maybe we need planning permission
