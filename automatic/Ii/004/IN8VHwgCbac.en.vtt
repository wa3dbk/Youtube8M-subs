think what we're going to see is

00:00:52.729 --> 00:00:55.210 
think what we're going to see is
significantly<00:00:53.600> reduced<00:00:53.809> stopping<00:00:54.589> over<00:00:55.070> the

put<00:01:06.680> this<00:01:06.799> thing<00:01:06.979> through<00:01:07.159> its<00:01:07.280> paces<00:01:07.520> let's

00:01:08.109 --> 00:01:08.119 
put this thing through its paces let's

00:01:08.119 --> 00:01:20.750 
put this thing through its paces let's
do<00:01:08.299> it

it's not only performance we're after

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:49.970 
it's not only performance we're after
it's<00:01:46.230> looks<00:01:48.200> alright<00:01:49.200> we've<00:01:49.380> got<00:01:49.590> the<00:01:49.770> stock

00:01:49.970 --> 00:01:49.980

00:01:51.470 --> 00:01:51.480 
brake system off and we're ready to

00:01:51.480 --> 00:01:53.450 
brake system off and we're ready to
install<00:01:51.600> the<00:01:51.990> barre<00:01:52.350> extreme<00:01:52.860> plus<00:01:53.160> brake

system<00:01:53.850> right<00:01:54.510> away<00:01:54.570> I've<00:01:54.900> noticed<00:01:55.260> quite<00:01:55.410> a

00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:55.500 
system right away I've noticed quite a

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:57.320 
system right away I've noticed quite a
few<00:01:55.590> differences<00:01:56.190> it's<00:01:56.670> really<00:01:57.060> going<00:01:57.180> to<00:01:57.240> be

00:01:57.320 --> 00:01:57.330 
few differences it's really going to be

00:01:57.330 --> 00:01:59.090 
few differences it's really going to be
beneficial<00:01:57.480> in<00:01:58.050> decreasing<00:01:58.380> our<00:01:58.620> stopping

00:01:59.090 --> 00:01:59.100 
beneficial in decreasing our stopping

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:01.190 
beneficial in decreasing our stopping
time<00:01:59.280> as<00:01:59.730> you<00:02:00.000> can<00:02:00.150> see<00:02:00.330> with<00:02:00.540> the<00:02:00.630> stock<00:02:00.900> rotor

00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:01.200 
time as you can see with the stock rotor

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:03.980 
time as you can see with the stock rotor
it's<00:02:01.890> a<00:02:02.010> pretty<00:02:02.280> decent<00:02:02.550> size<00:02:02.810> especially<00:02:03.810> for

00:02:03.980 --> 00:02:03.990 
it's a pretty decent size especially for

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:06.170 
it's a pretty decent size especially for
stock<00:02:04.230> but<00:02:04.890> with<00:02:05.010> the<00:02:05.130> bear<00:02:05.400> you<00:02:05.670> have<00:02:05.700> much

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:06.180 
stock but with the bear you have much

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:08.630 
stock but with the bear you have much
more<00:02:06.480> mass<00:02:06.780> more<00:02:07.560> mass<00:02:07.830> means<00:02:08.430> better

00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:08.640 
more mass more mass means better

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:10.609 
more mass more mass means better

days of gender driving without heavy use
of<00:04:36.840> the<00:04:36.930> brakes<00:04:37.199> then<00:04:38.100> we<00:04:38.430> performed<00:04:38.820> a<00:04:38.910> series

00:04:39.260 --> 00:04:39.270 
of the brakes then we performed a series

00:04:39.270 --> 00:04:41.600 
of the brakes then we performed a series
of<00:04:39.300> stops<00:04:39.660> followed<00:04:40.350> by<00:04:40.500> freeway<00:04:40.979> driving<00:04:41.310> to

00:04:41.600 --> 00:04:41.610 
of stops followed by freeway driving to

00:04:41.610 --> 00:04:43.909 
of stops followed by freeway driving to
allow<00:04:41.820> the<00:04:41.880> rotors<00:04:42.330> and<00:04:42.509> pads<00:04:42.690> to<00:04:42.930> cool<00:04:43.110> the

allow the rotors and pads to cool the

00:04:43.919 --> 00:04:45.469 
allow the rotors and pads to cool the
process<00:04:44.340> was<00:04:44.520> easy<00:04:44.699> but<00:04:44.970> it<00:04:45.090> took<00:04:45.180> about<00:04:45.419> a

00:04:45.469 --> 00:04:45.479 
process was easy but it took about a

00:04:45.479 --> 00:04:47.240 
process was easy but it took about a
week<00:04:45.720> to<00:04:45.750> perform<00:04:45.960> before<00:04:46.680> we<00:04:46.800> were<00:04:46.949> really

00:04:47.240 --> 00:04:47.250
