00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:44.010
 well I'm already here at the interface in 

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:46.830
 on the desktop here from my 

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:48.510
 before starting this class. 

00:00:46.830 --> 00:00:51.180
 person would like to talk about this class 

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:54.720
 was requested by the channel subscriber 

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:58.230
 my brother daniel souza is so there 

00:00:54.720 --> 00:01:01.560
 Let's see what it's like to fix bugs in 

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:06.360
 disk is on the hard disk in our disk 

00:01:01.560 --> 00:01:11.310
 our hd hard drive in files and here 

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:13.409
 on this screen are you and here is the one directly 

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:17.220
 Here you can hit here in the botton 

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:20.280
 top of the local disk is the right button 

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:24.020
 mouse property that also gives or 

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:26.460
 so you come here on computer 

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:29.700
 documents you see on your computer 

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:32.430
 that's where're the local disk that is the 

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:35.520
 our DNA and our hard drive 

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:36.720
 well I show you how that makes this 

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:38.610
 correction the person 

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:40.740
 this sometimes sometimes differs a bit 

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:42.600
 from that operating system to the system 

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:46.619
 I'm running this 

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:48.540
 operation on windows 8 pro 17 is a 

00:01:46.619 --> 00:01:49.590
 bit different in windows xp or even 

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:52.170
 I know how it is 

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:54.869
 but you try and it's ok, but 

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:57.210
 some things can sometimes happen 

00:01:54.869 --> 00:01:59.220
 in a slightly different way is 

00:01:57.210 --> 00:02:04.710
 Another thing I was going to tell you 

00:01:59.220 --> 00:02:08.189
 Our talent hd here mine has 159 of 

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:11.459
 goose is free of 288 

00:02:08.189 --> 00:02:14.159
 The more space and I see you here. 

00:02:11.459 --> 00:02:16.150
 free people are better 

00:02:14.159 --> 00:02:19.750
 The less things I have 

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:22.239
 the hard disk hd is better for the 

00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:25.780
 performance of the computer is because 

00:02:22.239 --> 00:02:27.700
 computer when there is a lot in the 

00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:29.530
 He has to read everything. 

00:02:27.700 --> 00:02:31.689
 That thing, all right? 

00:02:29.530 --> 00:02:34.209
 finally it takes a little longer then what 

00:02:31.689 --> 00:02:35.739
 You can save it for videos. 

00:02:34.209 --> 00:02:38.739
 new suddenly you have a lot of videos on 

00:02:35.739 --> 00:02:41.140
 Your computer board account on youtube is 

00:02:38.739 --> 00:02:44.140
 upload and save your videos 

00:02:41.140 --> 00:02:46.420
 videos on youtube that is well saved 

00:02:44.140 --> 00:02:49.810
 and you want any one of them is just 

00:02:46.420 --> 00:02:51.909
 you pick up and download it low 

00:02:49.810 --> 00:02:53.409
 beyond its own channel you download it 

00:02:51.909 --> 00:02:57.760
 has videos on the channel teaching to do 

00:02:53.409 --> 00:02:59.620
 this both by the hd downloader that does 

00:02:57.760 --> 00:03:01.780
 this is perfectly the act of khat 

00:02:59.620 --> 00:03:04.840
 also low and the videos 

00:03:01.780 --> 00:03:07.329
 It's okay, but do not leave it there. 

00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:09.189
 you 'll be able to perform 

00:03:07.329 --> 00:03:11.200
 better on your computer 

00:03:09.189 --> 00:03:12.519
 but let's go do the cleaning here in 

00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:16.689
 Up you will right click 

00:03:12.519 --> 00:03:19.689
 mouse will look at property here 

00:03:16.689 --> 00:03:21.549
 in this part is where I taught to do 

00:03:19.689 --> 00:03:24.099
 disk cleaning and everything else I go 

00:03:21.549 --> 00:03:25.449
 now taught to correct where you come from 

00:03:24.099 --> 00:03:28.049
 what tools 

00:03:25.449 --> 00:03:30.730
 there is here this option here 

00:03:28.049 --> 00:03:33.159
 optimization of computer units 

00:03:30.730 --> 00:03:34.900
 can help you run more 

00:03:33.159 --> 00:03:37.000
 then you can 

00:03:34.900 --> 00:03:39.250
 use agency here the video 

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:40.959
 but what we see today this part 

00:03:39.250 --> 00:03:43.620
 here the error checking 

00:03:40.959 --> 00:03:46.750
 this option this option checks 

00:03:43.620 --> 00:03:49.690
 check whether the system error 

00:03:46.750 --> 00:03:53.760
 files on the drive and also the way 

00:03:49.690 --> 00:03:57.250
 you make repairs to your drive. 

00:03:53.760 --> 00:04:02.109
 hard drive're you click here 

00:03:57.250 --> 00:04:04.359
 check it is not necessary to check 

00:04:02.109 --> 00:04:07.419
 any unit found that you 

00:04:04.359 --> 00:04:09.489
 you can still check for errors in the 

00:04:07.419 --> 00:04:11.799
 unit if desired 

00:04:09.489 --> 00:04:14.680
 the new Windows 7 on I think not 

00:04:11.799 --> 00:04:17.829
 This message appears here. 

00:04:14.680 --> 00:04:19.329
 I can verify here weight of not having 

00:04:17.829 --> 00:04:23.190
 I'll show it up, I'll hug it here. 

00:04:19.329 --> 00:04:23.190
 to see what it's like to check 

00:04:23.330 --> 00:04:27.889
 depending on the age and disk size 

00:04:26.840 --> 00:04:30.590
 hard right 

00:04:27.889 --> 00:04:33.229
 is today's hard drive and larger 

00:04:30.590 --> 00:04:37.810
 the outer front can be delayed 

00:04:33.229 --> 00:04:40.250
 but my here, in case it's small 

00:04:37.810 --> 00:04:43.400
 288 gigabyte 

00:04:40.250 --> 00:04:46.069
 the maximum capacity of my hd 

00:04:43.400 --> 00:04:48.729
 then doing here're giving here that 

00:04:46.069 --> 00:04:51.139
 approximately 1 minute and 30 seconds 

00:04:48.729 --> 00:04:56.020
 was the following I'll give after here 

00:04:51.139 --> 00:04:59.419
 maybe the print does not get too curl 

00:04:56.020 --> 00:05:02.990
 back and when it's finished ended here 

00:04:59.419 --> 00:05:05.419
 Look, I could barely see 

00:05:02.990 --> 00:05:07.849
 It takes a break on TV is not that the 

00:05:05.419 --> 00:05:09.919
 drive checked with this windows 

00:05:07.849 --> 00:05:12.979
 verified unit correctly 

00:05:09.919 --> 00:05:15.319
 Error Found When You Have Errors Is 

00:05:12.979 --> 00:05:19.490
 it will seem here the function for you 

00:05:15.319 --> 00:05:21.199
 power is to make you operate in 

00:05:19.490 --> 00:05:22.129
 some cases you need to restart the 

00:05:21.199 --> 00:05:23.719
 computer 

00:05:22.129 --> 00:05:26.810
 there you follow in the footsteps of 

00:05:23.719 --> 00:05:29.810
 procedures which there probably the 

00:05:26.810 --> 00:05:34.340
 windows itself will be able to repair 

00:05:29.810 --> 00:05:38.360
 mistakes there that mistakes that by chance 

00:05:34.340 --> 00:05:41.509
 they will suddenly have it in their 

00:05:38.360 --> 00:05:42.139
 local disk if on your HD on your disk 

00:05:41.509 --> 00:05:44.629
 hard 

00:05:42.139 --> 00:05:46.430
 Okay, so this tip I wanted 

00:05:44.629 --> 00:05:49.009
 from today I hope you 

00:05:46.430 --> 00:05:51.620
 liked the daniel souza 

00:05:49.009 --> 00:05:53.960
 This is a mistake, I do not know if he spoke 

00:05:51.620 --> 00:05:56.389
 that he was the chip that most tries to do 

00:05:53.960 --> 00:05:58.400
 try to do because all Hindus have 

00:05:56.389 --> 00:06:01.279
 this part of verification tool 

00:05:58.400 --> 00:06:04.819
 errors tries to likely 

00:06:01.279 --> 00:06:06.919
 will be able to recover your good hd 

00:06:04.819 --> 00:06:09.080
 A hug, everyone, stay with God.

 add favorite videos because 

00:06:10.879 --> 00:06:16.129
