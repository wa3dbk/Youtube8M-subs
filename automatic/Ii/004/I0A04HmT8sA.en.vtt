00:00:04.190 --> 00:00:07.230
 today we are here for another video 

00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:09.269
 class 

00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:11.730
 My name is bigger is about your technique . 

00:00:09.269 --> 00:00:14.610
 west on team walnut team 

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:16.590
 I'm here to show you 

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:21.020
 defense technique that is not so is more 

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:21.020
 important that you defend than attack 

00:00:21.859 --> 00:00:28.349
 the colleague's input and how do I 

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:29.310
 defense came in from bologna my two 

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:31.380
 legs 

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:33.540
 the first thing I have to always 

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:36.600
 anticipate his move 

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:38.850
 so what I'm going to do I use mine 

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:40.500
 hand on head 

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:42.120
 forcing him down to him not 

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:44.969
 I can lift my head and I'll play 

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:47.789
 my whole hip down and this 

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:51.350
 My hand will go under the armpits. 

00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:54.000
 I do it this movement advocates 

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:55.079
 sure I always have to anticipate I do not 

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:58.079
 I can stop delivering completely 

00:00:55.079 --> 00:00:59.820
 my leg, he comes here, I already defended 

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:02.190
 so how will my hip ever have 

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:05.010
 who is weighing my hand is in the 

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:07.619
 his head is on the back of my neck 

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:10.020
 I will switch to under his armpit and 

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:13.080
 my other hand on the waist 

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:13.799
 I just make this move and put it on 

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:22.170
 low 

00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:23.670
 I'm holding him and hugged the detail 

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:25.770
 more importantly I can not help 

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:27.869
 hold my leg holds my leg 

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:29.400
 he has already closed the probability of the 

00:01:27.869 --> 00:01:32.400
 to defend is much smaller 

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:37.590
 so he will find it here I'll go 

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:38.939
 Waiting as a photo, I already put my 

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:40.829
 hip own back 

00:01:38.939 --> 00:01:42.960
 here I can think I can stay here 

00:01:40.829 --> 00:01:45.990
 and here I am defending head of list 

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:48.630
 just down and my arm is down 

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:51.829
 on top of it then the property of 

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:51.829
 lift it is very difficult 

00:01:54.980 --> 00:02:00.390
 I hope you have enjoyed 

00:01:57.330 --> 00:02:03.180
 I'm here as a max partner, the student is 

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:05.820
 if you are interested in wanting 

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:09.000
 learn a little more from the favor 

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:12.420
 People are here and it's not a class just for 

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:15.560
 athletes but by ordinary people so as 

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:15.560
 waiting for you team
