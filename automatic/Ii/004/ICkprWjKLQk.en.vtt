00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.069
 we are with professor maximum at a ucci 

00:00:02.669 --> 00:00:08.010
 the president of astoi and the organizer 

00:00:05.069 --> 00:00:10.219
 of this splendid event is the iv 

00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:14.190
 international congress 

00:00:10.219 --> 00:00:17.789
 we are one year after the event by 

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:20.340
 brought to the deputies' room with everything 

00:00:17.789 --> 00:00:23.550
 what we had always been 

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:25.769
 in montecitorio we are always in a 

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:28.800
 institutional environment we always have 

00:00:25.769 --> 00:00:30.090
 this year we find guests again 

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:32.880
 International 

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:34.469
 perhaps the topping of what regards 

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:38.579
 not that of the study of oncology 

00:00:34.469 --> 00:00:39.450
 integration of care 

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:42.719
 oncologic 

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:47.010
 we would like to know from the professor what it is 

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:49.980
 think of the 2012 version and you are 

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:52.350
 satisfied to be finally results 

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:55.379
 they are coming because it seems to me from 

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:59.300
 what our colleagues told us 

00:00:55.379 --> 00:01:04.799
 this is happening , meanwhile, thanks 

00:00:59.300 --> 00:01:08.670
 of your presence because always of 

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:09.540
 the more we need to have of 

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:11.549
 make yourself known 

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:13.740
 and we are true to the IV congress 

00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:16.729
 there was also international this year 

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:16.729
 about 200 people 

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:22.530
 guests and members were especially 

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:24.150
 there I will win international staff of 

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:26.790
 very high level 

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:30.140
 let's think of the professor at gavardo and that l 

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:33.270
 director of the experimental program 

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:35.850
 oncology on therapies on therapies e 

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:38.790
 the natural substances of MD anderson 

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:41.840
 cancer center let's say it's the top of those 

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:46.259
 which are the natural substances in the world 

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:48.540
 there have been many relationship reports 

00:01:46.259 --> 00:01:50.070
 internations very very interesting 

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:55.219
 regarding the year technologies 

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:59.369
 have spoken is the director of 20 to 

00:01:55.219 --> 00:02:01.259
 tomczyk and subsequently spoke the 

00:01:59.369 --> 00:02:04.020
 Dr. Molinari of the Institute 

00:02:01.259 --> 00:02:05.939
 health care these figures are 

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:09.330
 really very important and gave 

00:02:05.939 --> 00:02:11.370
 the possibility and the visibility discarded it 

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:14.489
 iettatore that is always becoming of 

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:16.560
 more a point of reference than those 

00:02:14.489 --> 00:02:19.590
 which are the various figures 

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:21.030
 professional at national level of the 

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:23.400
 integrated therapy 

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:27.690
 not only but it is precisely these 

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:30.900
 these of these hours the connection 

00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:31.980
 with the Milan Tumors Institute la 

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:33.629
 francs 

00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:36.209
 he told me he had to work with him 

00:02:33.629 --> 00:02:38.730
 la franchi is the president of meteco 

00:02:36.209 --> 00:02:41.220
 so it is a true association 

00:02:38.730 --> 00:02:44.129
 important of the umori institute in milan 

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:50.390
 not only but for the next event 

00:02:44.129 --> 00:02:54.629
 they are toy at an institutional level 

00:02:50.390 --> 00:02:56.069
 it will be in April or May then we'll do it 

00:02:54.629 --> 00:02:58.260
 know 

00:02:56.069 --> 00:03:01.290
 within the college of 

00:02:58.260 --> 00:03:04.019
 health an organization of an event of 

00:03:01.290 --> 00:03:06.900
 this genre in collaboration with art 

00:03:04.019 --> 00:03:10.260
 it certainly won't be just one of the 

00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:12.510
 present but one who organizes together 

00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:15.150
 an event to the higher institute 

00:03:12.510 --> 00:03:17.370
 of this kind therefore this for me 

00:03:15.150 --> 00:03:19.980
 for me for us because we are now 

00:03:17.370 --> 00:03:20.760
 even become about sixty 

00:03:19.980 --> 00:03:23.900
 subscribers 

00:03:20.760 --> 00:03:26.659
 within arta then associates 

00:03:23.900 --> 00:03:29.060
 so this gives me hope 

00:03:26.659 --> 00:03:31.549
 it gives happiness because we are 

00:03:29.060 --> 00:03:34.430
 organizing something serious that 

00:03:31.549 --> 00:03:36.500
 seems to be helping patients because 

00:03:34.430 --> 00:03:39.530
 then we will have to see all that again 

00:03:36.500 --> 00:03:41.989
 which is the nutritional part and therefore with 

00:03:39.530 --> 00:03:46.189
 the international workshop will be back 

00:03:41.989 --> 00:03:48.260
 present that we will see how it will end by 

00:03:46.189 --> 00:03:52.819
 this point of view professor professor 

00:03:48.260 --> 00:03:56.629
 born by bet it was born as one 

00:03:52.819 --> 00:03:58.790
 need and a desire where she did it 

00:03:56.629 --> 00:04:01.970
 president has carried out a project 

00:03:58.790 --> 00:04:04.069
 how does it feel now that the institute 

00:04:01.970 --> 00:04:06.769
 top health care takes us to 

00:04:04.069 --> 00:04:08.810
 arm and is carrying us forward is 

00:04:06.769 --> 00:04:12.170
 that's a good question to this e 

00:04:08.810 --> 00:04:14.900
 thank you because it's true he was born he was born 

00:04:12.170 --> 00:04:17.209
 by chance it was born by chance for the needs 

00:04:14.900 --> 00:04:18.889
 I don't say personal but because he had to 

00:04:17.209 --> 00:04:22.460
 come out something is also born 

00:04:18.889 --> 00:04:27.910
 thanks to other colleagues we started 

00:04:22.460 --> 00:04:32.330
 in 78 we are in 60 people in 60 members 

00:04:27.910 --> 00:04:36.199
 find yourself having requests for 

00:04:32.330 --> 00:04:37.070
 collaboration so important and not 

00:04:36.199 --> 00:04:39.830
 hope 

00:04:37.070 --> 00:04:42.500
 and it is clear that he leaves us well who leaves 

00:04:39.830 --> 00:04:44.840
 happy and tells us that it is 

00:04:42.500 --> 00:04:46.909
 basically we were right and 

00:04:44.840 --> 00:04:49.250
 so not because others had 

00:04:46.909 --> 00:04:52.789
 wrong because what we thought 

00:04:49.250 --> 00:04:56.409
 was perhaps something like forward 

00:04:52.789 --> 00:04:56.409
 as I said even when I started 

00:04:56.800 --> 00:05:03.560
 the opening by saying we must be 

00:04:59.870 --> 00:05:06.650
 the vanguard to stimulate those who 

00:05:03.560 --> 00:05:08.630
 it's the institutions that do these things 

00:05:06.650 --> 00:05:10.909
