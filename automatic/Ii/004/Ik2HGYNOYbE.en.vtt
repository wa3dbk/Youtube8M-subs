all<00:01:58.649> offseason<00:01:59.100> long<00:01:59.840> absolutely<00:02:00.840> but<00:02:00.899> it's<00:02:01.049> a

00:02:01.069 --> 00:02:01.079 
all offseason long absolutely but it's a

00:02:01.079 --> 00:02:02.569 
all offseason long absolutely but it's a

huge difference you don't think playing

00:02:04.469 --> 00:02:06.319 
huge difference you don't think playing
