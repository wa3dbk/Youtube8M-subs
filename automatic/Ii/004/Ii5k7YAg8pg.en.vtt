00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:36.930
 release of pleasant viewing 

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:38.820
 we begin today with vibro which is successful 

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:40.649
 took advantage of bird tiles 

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:42.540
 after the repurchase but specifically in this 

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:44.309
 the moment he is still alive trying to beat the towers 

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:45.989
 now trying to live in a hut 

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:48.270
 not long enough because 

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:50.190
 BKB slept and Zeus gives the ulta a few 

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:52.140
 seconds dude playing for yuri decides 

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:54.030
 if it makes sense to swim in the end come to 

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:56.579
 conclude that up meaning is redeemed 

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:58.050
 Ulta lives and dies again and 

00:00:56.579 --> 00:00:59.280
 the second time he died so fast that 

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:01.199
 I suggest to look at it in 

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:03.030
 slow motion replay at the moment he 

00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:04.920
 dead now he is bought resides 

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:06.840
 timelaps are exactly behind the curtain 

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:08.909
 spirit which has no mana and 

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:10.560
 on which the antimag is shedding 

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:13.380
 that's just amazing implemented 

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:14.939
 baybek and faith second episode for today 

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:16.920
 before you a disruptor that goes on 

00:01:14.939 --> 00:01:18.750
 fountain replenish small and hilita 

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:20.729
 and already coming to his own fountain he 

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:22.409
 saw a sign miners would all be nothing but 

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:23.970
 the fact is that in their team the minera 

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:25.950
 Well, in order to understand what 

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:28.290
 happened let's roll off the game for a couple 

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:29.790
 minutes ago about her and who is it here 

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:32.159
 hid in the bushes next to the enemy 

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:33.930
 fountain yes it's menu or which 

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:36.060
 now under the poppies will mine 

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:37.920
 this same fountain but due to the fact that 

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:40.170
 he has an aganim plate will cover him 

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:42.030
 do not need the same from vision and fountain in the end 

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:43.409
 a couple of minutes spent on mining 

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:45.210
 steam from poppies to be 

00:01:43.409 --> 00:01:46.829
 invisible to the fountain and disruptor 

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:48.479
 who was probably already thinking which one 

00:01:46.829 --> 00:01:50.189
 don't him go after he 

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:50.960
 will buy a scroll sent eventually to 

00:01:50.189 --> 00:01:52.580
 tavern 

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:54.890
 the miner who arranged it all watched 

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:56.479
 coming from the bushes nearby right 

00:01:54.890 --> 00:01:59.090
 like maniacs watching your 

00:01:56.479 --> 00:02:01.909
 victims and now the golden classics 

00:01:59.090 --> 00:02:03.740
 gorgeous pooja hooks freark slark 

00:02:01.909 --> 00:02:05.540
 banished haga devoir banish 

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:07.520
 bladicker but not in a hurry plastic 

00:02:05.540 --> 00:02:09.229
 run and throws ulta on slarks to 

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:10.610
 he did not catch up with him after which the puja 

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:12.709
 attempted apparently 

00:02:10.610 --> 00:02:14.720
 hook the board of Cyrus through the slarke 

00:02:12.709 --> 00:02:16.970
 but somehow you know did not work and in the end 

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:18.770
 slark turns into a tavern can still 

00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:20.750
 just enjoy this beautiful hook 

00:02:18.770 --> 00:02:22.640
 slow motion I don’t know what 

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:25.010
 hoping for a pooj maybe a hook 

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:26.180
 will round arc welding fall bladsikera 

00:02:25.010 --> 00:02:27.560
 and pull out as well 

00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:29.330
 or maybe the fact that it was ticker 

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:31.190
 bribing because other 

00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:33.140
 I do not see any options here, but in the end everything 

00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:35.239
 ended as ended and slark 

00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:36.709
 turned out to be in the tavern it is a pity only that 

00:02:35.239 --> 00:02:38.330
 a team with a slarka I played wing 

00:02:36.709 --> 00:02:40.910
 who would also svapnuli it after 

00:02:38.330 --> 00:02:42.440
 this wonderful hook and here we have 

00:02:40.910 --> 00:02:44.239
 was nor who walked walked by 

00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:46.670
 an enemy pouring the light suddenly came across 

00:02:44.239 --> 00:02:48.590
 to the whole enemy team and to the rescue to 

00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:50.600
 he came to drive that flew his 

00:02:48.590 --> 00:02:52.220
 tyazh fountain itself royal 

00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:54.019
 using the army of the night stalker we 

00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:56.060
 and the screech takes it with him to base a 

00:02:54.019 --> 00:02:57.709
 no, he doesn't take it in his ear nods pooj 

00:02:56.060 --> 00:02:59.269
 the opposite of puja from the past 

00:02:57.709 --> 00:03:00.890
 episode this hook can be called 

00:02:59.269 --> 00:03:02.989
 really gorgeous without any 

00:03:00.890 --> 00:03:04.940
 I don’t know sarcasm he did this 

00:03:02.989 --> 00:03:06.620
 specially but in any case the movie he his 

00:03:04.940 --> 00:03:08.630
 so much during the night 

00:03:06.620 --> 00:03:10.459
 stalker even being at the base in the end 

00:03:08.630 --> 00:03:12.560
 anyway returned to the enemy's embrace 

00:03:10.459 --> 00:03:14.720
 teams well and finish it off 20 x m not 

00:03:12.560 --> 00:03:16.820
 made no trouble here about 

00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:19.100
 somehow you need to hook well 

00:03:16.820 --> 00:03:20.600
 finally file performed by Rubik here 

00:03:19.100 --> 00:03:22.519
 you see timbersaw climb on 

00:03:20.600 --> 00:03:24.110
 hockey finds here necropos gives 

00:03:22.519 --> 00:03:26.329
 vision to your teammates and they all together 

00:03:24.110 --> 00:03:28.040
 it would seem to have a happy ending 

00:03:26.329 --> 00:03:30.320
 now sting simple rests against a tree and 

00:03:28.040 --> 00:03:31.730
 will leave from there but Rubik has other plans 

00:03:30.320 --> 00:03:33.440
 decides it would be fun to take 

00:03:31.730 --> 00:03:35.329
 enemy piper and he throw them and 

00:03:33.440 --> 00:03:36.590
 Gleb completely forgetting that there is his 

00:03:35.329 --> 00:03:38.120
 Allied tiger on low HP 

00:03:36.590 --> 00:03:39.980
 who in turn is meeting with 

00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:41.600
 viper survive could not of course it 

00:03:39.980 --> 00:03:43.070
 always great fun and great when you 

00:03:41.600 --> 00:03:44.299
 throwing your enemy sawdust 

00:03:43.070 --> 00:03:46.220
 character on x g 

00:03:44.299 --> 00:03:47.329
 usually standing there and trying to wait when 

00:03:46.220 --> 00:03:49.250
 he will bring the like 

00:03:47.329 --> 00:03:51.200
 or in St. Petersburg with teammates and knocks him down 

00:03:49.250 --> 00:03:52.880
 he can do nothing in return but in 

00:03:51.200 --> 00:03:53.720
 this time it didn’t work out that way 

00:03:52.880 --> 00:03:55.280
 as usual 

00:03:53.720 --> 00:03:57.230
 I think after what happened in 

00:03:55.280 --> 00:03:58.190
 As a result, the Rubik still regretted what he threw. 

00:03:57.230 --> 00:04:00.770
 viper on xg 

00:03:58.190 --> 00:04:02.600
 anata wo was clearly not worth it 

00:04:00.770 --> 00:04:04.640
