00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:34.950 
pigmentation they are mainly like a

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:36.440 
pigmentation they are mainly like a
satin<00:01:35.490> I<00:01:35.640> think<00:01:35.820> I<00:01:35.850> said<00:01:36.000> one<00:01:36.119> of<00:01:36.150> them<00:01:36.270> was<00:01:36.420> a

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:36.450 
satin I think I said one of them was a

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:38.420 
satin I think I said one of them was a
matte<00:01:36.689> I'm<00:01:36.840> pretty<00:01:37.079> sure<00:01:37.290> that<00:01:37.920> all<00:01:38.130> of<00:01:38.159> these

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:38.430 
matte I'm pretty sure that all of these

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:41.120 
matte I'm pretty sure that all of these
are<00:01:38.490> more<00:01:38.880> of<00:01:39.270> a<00:01:39.810> light<00:01:40.079> satin<00:01:40.590> so<00:01:40.770> mostly

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:41.130 
are more of a light satin so mostly

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:42.770 
are more of a light satin so mostly
matte<00:01:41.400> but<00:01:41.610> a<00:01:41.670> little<00:01:41.970> bit<00:01:42.150> of<00:01:42.270> shimmer<00:01:42.420> that

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:42.780 
matte but a little bit of shimmer that

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:45.649 
matte but a little bit of shimmer that
you<00:01:43.229> can't<00:01:43.500> really<00:01:43.740> see<00:01:44.220> but<00:01:44.549> really<00:01:45.210> helps<00:01:45.540> to

00:01:45.649 --> 00:01:45.659 
you can't really see but really helps to

00:01:45.659 --> 00:01:47.840 
you can't really see but really helps to
have<00:01:46.290> the<00:01:46.439> colors<00:01:46.799> blend<00:01:47.130> a<00:01:47.310> lot<00:01:47.460> nicer<00:01:47.640> than

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:47.850 
have the colors blend a lot nicer than

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:50.179 
have the colors blend a lot nicer than
sometimes<00:01:48.420> mattes<00:01:48.689> can<00:01:48.960> I<00:01:49.200> do<00:01:49.439> like<00:01:49.829> one

00:01:50.179 --> 00:01:50.189 
sometimes mattes can I do like one

00:01:50.189 --> 00:01:51.980 
sometimes mattes can I do like one

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:16.540 
I use Nick's milk jumbo eyeshadow pencil

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:19.290 
I use Nick's milk jumbo eyeshadow pencil
in<00:02:16.840> almost<00:02:17.110> every<00:02:17.350> single<00:02:17.530> video<00:02:18.210> but<00:02:19.210> this

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:19.300 
in almost every single video but this

00:02:19.300 --> 00:02:23.510 
in almost every single video but this
one<00:02:19.510> is<00:02:19.600> in<00:02:19.630> cashmere<00:02:20.560> and<00:02:20.760> it<00:02:21.760> looks<00:02:22.330> like<00:02:22.690> a

00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:23.520 
one is in cashmere and it looks like a

00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:27.360 
one is in cashmere and it looks like a
soft<00:02:24.520> gold<00:02:24.970> in<00:02:25.390> the<00:02:25.690> packaging<00:02:26.260> and<00:02:26.440> it<00:02:26.560> is<00:02:26.860> but

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:27.370 
soft gold in the packaging and it is but

00:02:27.370 --> 00:02:30.090 
soft gold in the packaging and it is but
it<00:02:27.490> does<00:02:27.700> come<00:02:28.060> off<00:02:28.270> when<00:02:28.870> you<00:02:28.990> apply<00:02:29.350> it<00:02:29.410> much

00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:30.100 
it does come off when you apply it much

00:02:30.100 --> 00:02:32.220 
it does come off when you apply it much
much<00:02:30.400> lighter<00:02:30.820> and<00:02:30.970> I<00:02:31.180> actually<00:02:31.390> really

00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:32.230 
much lighter and I actually really

00:02:32.230 --> 00:02:34.800 
much lighter and I actually really
really<00:02:32.530> like<00:02:32.860> that<00:02:33.100> it<00:02:33.580> works<00:02:33.700> so<00:02:33.940> well<00:02:34.330> as<00:02:34.780> a

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:34.810 
really like that it works so well as a

00:02:34.810 --> 00:02:36.690 
really like that it works so well as a
base<00:02:35.140> because<00:02:35.620> it<00:02:35.770> gives<00:02:35.980> you<00:02:36.160> something<00:02:36.430> for

00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:36.700 
base because it gives you something for

00:02:36.700 --> 00:02:38.310 
base because it gives you something for
the<00:02:36.760> eye<00:02:36.850> shadow<00:02:36.940> to<00:02:37.300> stick<00:02:37.420> on<00:02:37.810> without

00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:38.320 
the eye shadow to stick on without

00:02:38.320 --> 00:02:40.440 
the eye shadow to stick on without
really<00:02:38.950> changing<00:02:39.070> the<00:02:39.490> color<00:02:39.820> so<00:02:40.120> what<00:02:40.210> apply

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:40.450 
really changing the color so what apply

00:02:40.450 --> 00:02:43.380 
really changing the color so what apply
is<00:02:40.510> like<00:02:40.750> a<00:02:40.780> really<00:02:41.340> soft<00:02:42.340> cashmere<00:02:42.790> I<00:02:43.120> mean<00:02:43.300> it

00:02:43.380 --> 00:02:43.390 
is like a really soft cashmere I mean it

00:02:43.390 --> 00:02:46.040 
is like a really soft cashmere I mean it
fits<00:02:43.540> the<00:02:43.750> name<00:02:43.930> but<00:02:44.140> it's<00:02:44.260> not<00:02:44.550> overly

00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:46.050 
fits the name but it's not overly

00:02:46.050 --> 00:02:48.990 
fits the name but it's not overly
pigmented<00:02:47.050> which<00:02:47.470> I<00:02:47.740> really<00:02:48.340> really<00:02:48.370> like<00:02:48.610> the

00:02:48.990 --> 00:02:49.000 
pigmented which I really really like the

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:51.090 
pigmented which I really really like the
next<00:02:49.300> product<00:02:49.540> is<00:02:49.930> the<00:02:49.960> eye<00:02:50.110> liner<00:02:50.530> and<00:02:50.890> this

00:02:51.090 --> 00:02:51.100 
next product is the eye liner and this

00:02:51.100 --> 00:02:53.970 
next product is the eye liner and this
is<00:02:51.400> the<00:02:52.300> studio<00:02:52.660> liquid<00:02:53.080> liner<00:02:53.260> and<00:02:53.620> it<00:02:53.800> comes

00:02:53.970 --> 00:02:53.980 
is the studio liquid liner and it comes

00:02:53.980 --> 00:02:58.230 
is the studio liquid liner and it comes
in<00:02:54.160> extreme<00:02:54.700> black<00:02:55.060> so<00:02:55.780> the<00:02:56.230> brush<00:02:57.040> on<00:02:57.370> it<00:02:57.640> is<00:02:57.940> a

00:02:58.230 --> 00:02:58.240 
in extreme black so the brush on it is a

00:02:58.240 --> 00:02:59.760 
in extreme black so the brush on it is a
brush<00:02:58.450> it's<00:02:58.690> not<00:02:58.840> one<00:02:58.960> of<00:02:58.990> those<00:02:59.200> felt-tip

00:02:59.760 --> 00:02:59.770 
brush it's not one of those felt-tip

00:02:59.770 --> 00:03:02.490 
brush it's not one of those felt-tip
ones<00:03:00.040> but<00:03:00.730> I<00:03:00.910> found<00:03:01.030> the<00:03:01.210> formula<00:03:01.480> to<00:03:01.750> be<00:03:01.990> kind

00:03:02.490 --> 00:03:02.500 
ones but I found the formula to be kind

00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:05.190 
ones but I found the formula to be kind
of<00:03:02.650> it<00:03:03.130> got<00:03:03.310> dry<00:03:03.610> really<00:03:03.910> quickly<00:03:04.000> so<00:03:04.840> I<00:03:04.870> would

00:03:05.190 --> 00:03:05.200 
of it got dry really quickly so I would

00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:07.170 
of it got dry really quickly so I would
be<00:03:05.320> lining<00:03:05.620> my<00:03:05.770> eyes<00:03:05.800> and<00:03:06.400> by<00:03:06.490> the<00:03:06.550> time<00:03:06.850> I<00:03:06.880> got

00:03:07.170 --> 00:03:07.180 
be lining my eyes and by the time I got

00:03:07.180 --> 00:03:10.950 
be lining my eyes and by the time I got
to<00:03:07.510> the<00:03:08.050> wing<00:03:08.260> part<00:03:08.620> I<00:03:08.860> needed<00:03:09.340> to<00:03:09.550> reapply<00:03:10.540> and

00:03:10.950 --> 00:03:10.960 
to the wing part I needed to reapply and

00:03:10.960 --> 00:03:13.980 
to the wing part I needed to reapply and
get<00:03:11.140> more<00:03:11.320> eyeliner<00:03:11.740> onto<00:03:12.430> the<00:03:12.580> brush<00:03:12.790> and<00:03:13.570> it

00:03:13.980 --> 00:03:13.990 
get more eyeliner onto the brush and it

00:03:13.990 --> 00:03:16.950 
get more eyeliner onto the brush and it
wasn't<00:03:14.230> like<00:03:14.770> a<00:03:15.100> normal<00:03:15.730> liner<00:03:16.480> where<00:03:16.870> it

00:03:16.950 --> 00:03:16.960 
wasn't like a normal liner where it

00:03:16.960 --> 00:03:18.330 
wasn't like a normal liner where it
seems<00:03:17.170> like<00:03:17.260> it<00:03:17.350> just<00:03:17.380> runs<00:03:17.739> out<00:03:17.800> of<00:03:17.950> product

00:03:18.330 --> 00:03:18.340 
seems like it just runs out of product

00:03:18.340 --> 00:03:21.210 
seems like it just runs out of product
this<00:03:18.550> kind<00:03:18.760> of<00:03:18.790> got<00:03:18.940> sticky<00:03:19.570> so<00:03:20.290> this<00:03:20.680> is<00:03:20.860> not

00:03:21.210 --> 00:03:21.220 
this kind of got sticky so this is not

00:03:21.220 --> 00:03:24.180 
this kind of got sticky so this is not
the<00:03:21.910> formula<00:03:22.540> on<00:03:22.660> it<00:03:22.840> was<00:03:22.989> not<00:03:23.170> my<00:03:23.410> favorite<00:03:24.010> at

00:03:24.180 --> 00:03:24.190 
the formula on it was not my favorite at

00:03:24.190 --> 00:03:27.780 
the formula on it was not my favorite at
all<00:03:24.480> but<00:03:25.480> I<00:03:25.660> do<00:03:25.720> like<00:03:26.080> the<00:03:26.290> brush<00:03:26.530> I<00:03:27.040> find<00:03:27.670> that

00:03:27.780 --> 00:03:27.790 
all but I do like the brush I find that

00:03:27.790 --> 00:03:29.100 
all but I do like the brush I find that
brushes<00:03:28.090> like<00:03:28.180> that<00:03:28.330> are<00:03:28.450> easier<00:03:28.720> to<00:03:28.780> apply

00:03:29.100 --> 00:03:29.110 
brushes like that are easier to apply

00:03:29.110 --> 00:03:30.990 
brushes like that are easier to apply
for<00:03:29.560> me<00:03:29.650> personally<00:03:29.830> than<00:03:30.370> using<00:03:30.640> felt<00:03:30.820> tip

00:03:30.990 --> 00:03:31.000 
for me personally than using felt tip

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:34.020 
for me personally than using felt tip
ones<00:03:31.209> so<00:03:32.140> it's<00:03:32.800> not<00:03:32.980> the<00:03:33.130> worst<00:03:33.370> liar<00:03:33.700> in<00:03:33.880> the

00:03:34.020 --> 00:03:34.030 
ones so it's not the worst liar in the

00:03:34.030 --> 00:03:35.490 
ones so it's not the worst liar in the
world<00:03:34.060> but<00:03:34.480> it<00:03:34.570> just<00:03:34.750> seems<00:03:34.930> like<00:03:34.989> it<00:03:35.170> needed<00:03:35.320> a

00:03:35.490 --> 00:03:35.500 
world but it just seems like it needed a

00:03:35.500 --> 00:03:37.710 
world but it just seems like it needed a
little<00:03:35.739> bit<00:03:35.830> extra<00:03:36.130> work<00:03:36.220> the<00:03:36.940> mascara<00:03:37.450> is

00:03:37.710 --> 00:03:37.720 
little bit extra work the mascara is

00:03:37.720 --> 00:03:40.140 
little bit extra work the mascara is

00:03:41.970 --> 00:03:41.980 
saying that and it's a volumizing and

00:03:48.240 --> 00:03:48.250 
it's a traditional mascara brush it's

00:03:48.250 --> 00:03:50.190 
it's a traditional mascara brush it's
not<00:03:48.400> like<00:03:48.519> one<00:03:48.670> of<00:03:48.730> those<00:03:48.820> plastic<00:03:49.420> spiky

00:03:50.190 --> 00:03:50.200 
not like one of those plastic spiky

00:03:50.200 --> 00:03:53.310 
not like one of those plastic spiky
medieval<00:03:50.800> looking<00:03:51.180> brushes<00:03:52.180> and<00:03:52.450> I<00:03:53.050> found

00:03:53.310 --> 00:03:53.320 
medieval looking brushes and I found

00:03:53.320 --> 00:03:54.840 
medieval looking brushes and I found
that<00:03:53.470> even<00:03:53.680> when<00:03:53.980> I<00:03:54.010> didn't<00:03:54.459> curl<00:03:54.670> my<00:03:54.820> lashes

00:03:54.840 --> 00:03:54.850 
that even when I didn't curl my lashes

00:03:54.850 --> 00:03:58.410 
that even when I didn't curl my lashes
it<00:03:55.600> really<00:03:55.959> helped<00:03:56.920> to<00:03:57.220> do<00:03:57.820> exactly<00:03:58.120> what<00:03:58.360> I

00:03:58.410 --> 00:03:58.420 
it really helped to do exactly what I

00:03:58.420 --> 00:04:01.140 
it really helped to do exactly what I
said<00:03:58.690> lengthen<00:03:59.200> and<00:03:59.380> volumize<00:04:00.100> them<00:04:00.430> so<00:04:00.910> this

00:04:01.140 --> 00:04:01.150 
said lengthen and volumize them so this

00:04:01.150 --> 00:04:05.370 
said lengthen and volumize them so this
mascara<00:04:01.570> is<00:04:02.019> also<00:04:02.920> it's<00:04:03.610> in<00:04:04.090> black<00:04:04.540> and<00:04:04.600> I

00:04:05.370 --> 00:04:05.380 
mascara is also it's in black and I

00:04:05.380 --> 00:04:06.570 
mascara is also it's in black and I
think<00:04:05.709> that<00:04:05.800> it<00:04:05.860> works<00:04:06.040> really<00:04:06.130> really<00:04:06.370> well

00:04:06.570 --> 00:04:06.580 
think that it works really really well

00:04:06.580 --> 00:04:08.550 
think that it works really really well

itself<00:05:34.870> feels<00:05:35.230> amazing<00:05:35.920> on<00:05:35.980> the<00:05:36.100> lips<00:05:36.280> usually

matte<00:05:36.880> products<00:05:37.300> are<00:05:37.420> kind<00:05:37.630> of<00:05:37.690> drying<00:05:38.050> and

00:05:38.430 --> 00:05:38.440 
matte products are kind of drying and

00:05:38.440 --> 00:05:41.070 
matte products are kind of drying and
don't<00:05:38.620> feel<00:05:38.950> super<00:05:39.880> soft<00:05:40.120> and<00:05:40.420> lush<00:05:40.630> but<00:05:40.900> this

00:05:41.070 --> 00:05:41.080 
don't feel super soft and lush but this

00:05:41.080 --> 00:05:43.590 
don't feel super soft and lush but this
does<00:05:41.440> really<00:05:41.710> moisturizing<00:05:42.700> but<00:05:43.030> still<00:05:43.360> being

00:05:43.590 --> 00:05:43.600 
does really moisturizing but still being

00:05:43.600 --> 00:05:44.850 
does really moisturizing but still being
matte<00:05:43.930> and<00:05:44.260> that's<00:05:44.380> something<00:05:44.680> that<00:05:44.800> you

00:05:44.850 --> 00:05:44.860 
matte and that's something that you

00:05:44.860 --> 00:05:46.500 
matte and that's something that you
don't<00:05:44.950> see<00:05:45.250> very<00:05:45.400> often<00:05:45.640> so<00:05:45.880> I<00:05:45.910> do<00:05:46.000> like<00:05:46.360> the

00:05:46.500 --> 00:05:46.510 
don't see very often so I do like the

00:05:46.510 --> 00:05:47.990 
don't see very often so I do like the
product<00:05:46.900> I<00:05:46.990> just<00:05:47.170> feel<00:05:47.290> like<00:05:47.350> the<00:05:47.500> color

00:05:47.990 --> 00:05:48.000 
product I just feel like the color

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:50.850 
product I just feel like the color
doesn't<00:05:49.000> really<00:05:49.150> fit<00:05:49.570> what<00:05:49.900> it<00:05:50.050> wasn't<00:05:50.530> what<00:05:50.830> I

00:05:50.850 --> 00:05:50.860 
doesn't really fit what it wasn't what I

00:05:50.860 --> 00:05:52.830 
doesn't really fit what it wasn't what I
would<00:05:51.100> have<00:05:51.190> put<00:05:51.400> in<00:05:51.520> this<00:05:51.640> kit<00:05:51.880> so<00:05:52.210> overall<00:05:52.720> I

00:05:52.830 --> 00:05:52.840 
would have put in this kit so overall I

00:05:52.840 --> 00:05:55.500 
would have put in this kit so overall I
think<00:05:53.110> this<00:05:53.410> set<00:05:53.650> is<00:05:53.830> a<00:05:53.860> really<00:05:54.550> great<00:05:55.000> deal

00:05:55.500 --> 00:05:55.510 
think this set is a really great deal

think this set is a really great deal
