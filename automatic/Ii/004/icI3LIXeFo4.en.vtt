00:00:09.299 --> 00:00:13.270
 carolina you with children at home you will know 

00:00:11.530 --> 00:00:15.010
 a lot of dirty dishes but also of 

00:00:13.270 --> 00:00:16.449
 broken dishes or children behave well 

00:00:15.010 --> 00:00:19.000
 Well look at the truth that thanks to the 

00:00:16.449 --> 00:00:22.840
 broken dishes not at this time not 

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:25.150
 dirty dishes yes but no dishes 

00:00:22.840 --> 00:00:27.700
 we the truth is that they behave very 

00:00:25.150 --> 00:00:30.100
 well maybe some troubled carla 

00:00:27.700 --> 00:00:31.570
 I could do but it's not I do not want to 

00:00:30.100 --> 00:00:33.880
 say it but they say when you say it 

00:00:31.570 --> 00:00:36.610
 you do then but has not been 

00:00:33.880 --> 00:00:40.149
 paint a sofa or paint us a wall and 

00:00:36.610 --> 00:00:42.010
 break a plate or is it good that 

00:00:40.149 --> 00:00:44.620
 in principle, good, tell us how 

00:00:42.010 --> 00:00:46.570
 they are the piques well I'm going to 

00:00:44.620 --> 00:00:49.059
 say I'm his mother I look at threads like 

00:00:46.570 --> 00:00:51.010
 well the truth that jo carlitos is 

00:00:49.059 --> 00:00:53.200
 tremendous because he's nine months old but 

00:00:51.010 --> 00:00:54.430
 already crawls he stands up he's 

00:00:53.200 --> 00:00:56.559
 hooking the two I think he will walk 

00:00:54.430 --> 00:00:58.420
 soon and good and carla has started 

00:00:56.559 --> 00:01:01.750
 alcohol and I do not know if it 's with the uniform 

00:00:58.420 --> 00:01:05.500
 ok but suddenly the view is wrong 

00:01:01.750 --> 00:01:07.330
 but you're thinking about going for 

00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:11.020
 the third because we have not always said 

00:01:07.330 --> 00:01:14.160
 that we would like numerous family and josh 

00:01:11.020 --> 00:01:14.160
 fixed ideas the truth 

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:23.020
 with two you have work is when the 

00:01:20.860 --> 00:01:25.479
 it's really hard not to recover 

00:01:23.020 --> 00:01:28.360
 because you do not stop at all send the 

00:01:25.479 --> 00:01:30.340
 little brother no no because it's good I think 

00:01:28.360 --> 00:01:33.550
 I do not know this is my theory I think that 

00:01:30.340 --> 00:01:35.320
 As a girl, she does not enter into rivalry and 

00:01:33.550 --> 00:01:37.720
 also take it out always always very much 

00:01:35.320 --> 00:01:40.600
 very very pink pink baby bottles pink clothes 

00:01:37.720 --> 00:01:43.030
 everything that is blue is from the child then 

00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:44.560
 he does not see that his things are used then 

00:01:43.030 --> 00:01:46.509
 I do not know if this helps or not but the 

00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:49.210
 truth is that he is not jealous he is very 

00:01:46.509 --> 00:01:52.570
 madraza then also want then 

00:01:49.210 --> 00:01:53.920
 play with him give him the bottle to take care of him and 

00:01:52.570 --> 00:01:55.420
 it makes you an illusion now we are with 

00:01:53.920 --> 00:01:56.420
 that you have to go look for her at school with 

00:01:55.420 --> 00:02:00.729
 carlitos 

00:01:56.420 --> 00:02:00.729
 and if we go in the boy is an angry 

00:02:01.040 --> 00:02:04.520
 edition of your face sounds like we're not going 

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:07.520
 to see improve 

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:09.590
 that you had to give up yes good no 

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:11.989
 It has been no no no that I have resigned 

00:02:09.590 --> 00:02:13.760
 but it has been a bit I think that the 

00:02:11.989 --> 00:02:15.530
 life are given the circumstances and the 

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:18.319
 way and things do not have to be forced 

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:20.239
 nor that to force them on the one hand 

00:02:18.319 --> 00:02:21.530
 they wanted a more musical jury the one 

00:02:20.239 --> 00:02:24.620
 was composed of people for more 

00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:26.000
 singers and I on the other hand, although 

00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:27.920
 I really like the format and I was 

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:29.959
 happy to be with them and such a good 

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:31.700
 Well, I also had other projects 

00:02:29.959 --> 00:02:33.920
 and in the end sometimes when they tell you I'm 

00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:35.900
 of game you try to fight being of 

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:38.480
 another kind of another way or being of 

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:40.400
 another way or such but I was in a 

00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:42.260
 moment I am in a moment also that 

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:44.180
 with for personal matters and 

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:45.650
 professionals since traveling to 

00:02:44.180 --> 00:02:47.000
 Barcelona was also going to complicate a 

00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:50.329
 little and in the end I did is look at things 

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:52.340
 they go through something and it's like that and it's been a 

00:02:50.329 --> 00:02:54.290
 pleasure to be these years with them for sure 

00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:56.989
 that will go divinely in this 

00:02:54.290 --> 00:02:58.549
 edition because every year they are exceeded and the 

00:02:56.989 --> 00:03:01.250
 casting also this year the truth that 

00:02:58.549 --> 00:03:03.140
 it's wonderful it 's wonderful but 

00:03:01.250 --> 00:03:05.569
 I'll go to the best one day visit 

00:03:03.140 --> 00:03:07.350
 to see them from inside doors and 

00:03:05.569 --> 00:03:09.780
 harmonica 

00:03:07.350 --> 00:03:12.180
 angelia do carlos also who had 

00:03:09.780 --> 00:03:15.320
 very good relationship with them but look 

00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:15.320
 otherwise go to enjoy 

00:03:16.640 --> 00:03:21.990
 I think they're going to make a monic duo and 

00:03:19.950 --> 00:03:24.060
 divine marten because they are friends 

00:03:21.990 --> 00:03:25.680
 Marta I do not know her personally in 

00:03:24.060 --> 00:03:28.170
 a very direct treatment but yes I know that 

00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:29.730
 it's fun and it's divine 

00:03:28.170 --> 00:03:32.820
 I can guarantee you that all the 

00:03:29.730 --> 00:03:34.410
 we know that that's not a 10 it's a 12 and 

00:03:32.820 --> 00:03:37.580
 then together I think that they are going to 

00:03:34.410 --> 00:03:37.580
 give momentazos sure 

00:03:38.240 --> 00:03:46.380
 Well, there are some things that do not 

00:03:41.250 --> 00:03:49.110
 I can say I can not tell you but good 

00:03:46.380 --> 00:03:51.000
 but yes there was a good two things 

00:03:49.110 --> 00:03:54.240
 that for me are important and I wanted 

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:56.580
 give them priority during this year so 

00:03:54.240 --> 00:03:59.660
 less this winter you will know shortly 

00:03:56.580 --> 00:03:59.660
 so do not pinch me
