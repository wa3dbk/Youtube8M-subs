00:00:00.550 --> 00:00:06.760
 Hello, how are you, Jorge Lara and in the 

00:00:03.310 --> 00:00:10.390
 This week's video I want to show you 

00:00:06.760 --> 00:00:12.550
 remove skin shine those 

00:00:10.390 --> 00:00:14.860
 white glitters that suddenly we have 

00:00:12.550 --> 00:00:17.619
 on the skin either because of the use of 

00:00:14.860 --> 00:00:20.499
 Sometimes people have skin a little 

00:00:17.619 --> 00:00:22.810
 fatty and we have that reflection the 

00:00:20.499 --> 00:00:25.539
 front or on the nose normally here in 

00:00:22.810 --> 00:00:28.659
 this case well, it was a session that 

00:00:25.539 --> 00:00:31.390
 I made my natalia friend where I have 

00:00:28.659 --> 00:00:34.120
 there is a bit of flash light that you 

00:00:31.390 --> 00:00:37.960
 is hitting on the cheek then 

00:00:34.120 --> 00:00:40.420
 I have a lot of that white point there 

00:00:37.960 --> 00:00:43.000
 well sometimes it's a bit annoying about 

00:00:40.420 --> 00:00:45.820
 all because they remember that the first 

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:47.350
 eyes place to go or 

00:00:45.820 --> 00:00:49.780
 they direct their eyes when it was a picture 

00:00:47.350 --> 00:00:51.999
 he pointed brighter then to the 

00:00:49.780 --> 00:00:53.980
 points where there is more light there opens the 

00:00:51.999 --> 00:00:55.359
 eye then also where sometimes not 

00:00:53.980 --> 00:00:57.460
 I want for example here I have a 

00:00:55.359 --> 00:01:00.950
 point of light and the eyes of the viewer 

00:00:57.460 --> 00:01:02.970
 they look at carp processes 

00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:04.590
 I always worked in robberies always 

00:01:02.970 --> 00:01:05.940
 I recommend working in robbery 

00:01:04.590 --> 00:01:08.730
 that way you are going to have a 

00:01:05.940 --> 00:01:11.010
 greater range to correct these things not 

00:01:08.730 --> 00:01:14.640
 correcting will correct temperatures by 

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:17.820
 example here as a balance make it very 

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:18.810
 quality is very cold and this is because 

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:21.120
 Photos 

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:24.420
 sorry if you had it in jpg 

00:01:21.120 --> 00:01:26.850
 they would be very limited to a number 

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:28.530
 very small steps in terms of balance 

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:30.420
 of targets in terms of exposure in 

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:33.570
 how about highlights and me with the red 

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:36.180
 well I can have much this range much 

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:39.720
 to be able to modify my photography 

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:41.460
 work it without getting to break 

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:44.310
 the picture that means follow 

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:47.700
 pixelated if you get to see very very badly the 

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:49.830
 then good image then here for 

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:52.380
 example what I'm going to do to eliminate 

00:01:49.830 --> 00:01:55.979
 a little the brightness that I have here in the 

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:57.450
 face is the face I'm going to do it in 

00:01:55.979 --> 00:02:00.200
 photoshop 

00:01:57.450 --> 00:02:02.350
 in the image I'm going to put edit in 

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:05.049
 photoshop 

00:02:02.350 --> 00:02:08.850
 and aeronautics mind I will spend the 

00:02:05.049 --> 00:02:13.170
 photo here to photoshop 

00:02:08.850 --> 00:02:15.870
 then already once I have my 

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:18.870
 photograph here in photoshop what I'm going 

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:22.080
 to do is identify the areas that 

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:24.630
 I have with that overexposure that they are 

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:28.020
 burned to work on them 

00:02:24.630 --> 00:02:29.700
 then I will create a new layer in 

00:02:28.020 --> 00:02:32.160
 the part of here in this icon below 

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:33.690
 on the right side around here will create me 

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:36.770
 a new leger 

00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:39.530
 I 'm going to give him the new laws 

00:02:36.770 --> 00:02:43.040
 parker 

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:45.620
 so it is not very strong on the 

00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:47.390
 stroke that I'm going to do they lived at 

00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:50.959
 second thing we're going to do is take the 

00:02:47.390 --> 00:02:53.630
 brush and search inside the area that 

00:02:50.959 --> 00:02:56.720
 we want to touch up look around some 

00:02:53.630 --> 00:03:00.080
 tone that is more or less what we 

00:02:56.720 --> 00:03:03.110
 let's go correct not put what 

00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:05.900
 So he selected a tonito here is a 

00:03:03.110 --> 00:03:08.720
 middle intermediate tone and selected my 

00:03:05.900 --> 00:03:11.870
 brush today think I'm going to put it then 

00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:15.709
 between 60 50 percent opacity and a 

00:03:11.870 --> 00:03:17.360
 87 percent flow that depends 

00:03:15.709 --> 00:03:19.970
 already of you depends on the photography 

00:03:17.360 --> 00:03:22.580
 that have so much light have what 

00:03:19.970 --> 00:03:24.680
 that is already going to depend a lot on 

00:03:22.580 --> 00:03:26.590
 you guys but I think you try to get him 

00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:30.019
 go there experimenting to see 

00:03:26.590 --> 00:03:31.690
 how they change then I start here to 

00:03:30.019 --> 00:03:35.819
 draw 

00:03:31.690 --> 00:03:38.730
 in the area that I want to correct 

00:03:35.819 --> 00:03:41.969
 then they saw I already have here no longer 

00:03:38.730 --> 00:03:43.950
 I have that white that I had if I want 

00:03:41.969 --> 00:03:46.889
 also for example correct a bit the 

00:03:43.950 --> 00:03:48.870
 of the nose because I also take my child 

00:03:46.889 --> 00:03:50.400
 but again because they are different 

00:03:48.870 --> 00:03:53.099
 tones and to which I have here the foot 

00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:55.939
 then like again my dropper like 

00:03:53.099 --> 00:03:59.750
 strabismus and brush and begins to correct 

00:03:55.939 --> 00:03:59.750
 the same here up 

00:04:02.380 --> 00:04:06.970
 sometimes it's nice the brightness gives a little 

00:04:05.380 --> 00:04:09.070
 of volume to give a little more volume 

00:04:06.970 --> 00:04:12.940
 but good if you want to have 

00:04:09.070 --> 00:04:15.220
 maybe the bride at a wedding at an event 

00:04:12.940 --> 00:04:17.290
 are doing and the bride has white 

00:04:15.220 --> 00:04:18.910
 white the forehead or the nose because if 

00:04:17.290 --> 00:04:21.130
 it's going to look a little weird then state 

00:04:18.910 --> 00:04:23.380
 it can work very well now if 

00:04:21.130 --> 00:04:25.480
 it would be a lot if it were very exaggerated that 

00:04:23.380 --> 00:04:27.430
 look a lot would like to go down a bit 

00:04:25.480 --> 00:04:31.580
 what will be reduce the opacity of 

00:04:27.430 --> 00:04:34.240
 leger 0 

00:04:31.580 --> 00:04:37.129
 here I'm going to a 

00:04:34.240 --> 00:04:39.380
 50 more or less 

00:04:37.129 --> 00:04:43.190
 and still 100 

00:04:39.380 --> 00:04:45.650
 then I would not let it 

00:04:43.190 --> 00:04:49.850
 reach to see a little bit the brightness what 

00:04:45.650 --> 00:04:53.260
 we leave in 60 and both 70% now since 

00:04:49.850 --> 00:04:55.390
 I have that part corrected 

00:04:53.260 --> 00:04:57.150
 what I'm going to do is that I'm not going to give 

00:04:55.390 --> 00:05:00.420
 merge 

00:04:57.150 --> 00:05:02.790
 the lakers so I had 22 layers now 

00:05:00.420 --> 00:05:06.900
 fill them I have one and can return 

00:05:02.790 --> 00:05:10.540
 a photoshop lightroom sorry I'm going to 

00:05:06.900 --> 00:05:14.310
 close here the save 

00:05:10.540 --> 00:05:14.310
 and automatically it's going 

00:05:14.380 --> 00:05:20.440
 to send the photo retouched here to the iron 

00:05:18.340 --> 00:05:23.830
 then serve for example here no longer 

00:05:20.440 --> 00:05:26.280
 I have that shine that the other one has here 

00:05:23.830 --> 00:05:26.280
 is one 

00:05:26.930 --> 00:05:31.520
 about the difference and nothing in the face 

00:05:28.789 --> 00:05:33.440
 it's good this guy is very fast and very 

00:05:31.520 --> 00:05:36.860
 useful for when you have that 

00:05:33.440 --> 00:05:38.930
 skin problem in the skins in the 

00:05:36.860 --> 00:05:42.020
 face especially that they come to have a 

00:05:38.930 --> 00:05:43.729
 little bit of fat and well, you guys 

00:05:42.020 --> 00:05:45.350
 you can correct with that and you're going to see 

00:05:43.729 --> 00:05:48.350
 very good skin 

00:05:45.350 --> 00:05:51.590
 although thank you very much continue here in 

00:05:48.350 --> 00:05:53.300
 Contact and be ready for more videos 

00:05:51.590 --> 00:05:55.730

00:05:53.300 --> 00:05:57.770
 especially if they want dishes on 

00:05:55.730 --> 00:06:00.440
 something or some question that they have or 

00:05:57.770 --> 00:06:03.130
 some other tutorial write out there in 

00:06:00.440 --> 00:06:06.410
 facebook or send me messages here 

00:06:03.130 --> 00:06:08.570
 and then gladly if I have the answer or
