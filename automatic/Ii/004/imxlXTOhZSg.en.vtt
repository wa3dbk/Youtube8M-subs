00:02:25.809 --> 00:02:25.819 
can go about this we could use this tank

00:02:25.819 --> 00:02:27.400 
can go about this we could use this tank
and<00:02:26.090> we<00:02:26.150> could<00:02:26.330> cut<00:02:26.510> it<00:02:26.629> all<00:02:26.720> apart<00:02:27.050> and<00:02:27.260> cut

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:27.410 
and we could cut it all apart and cut

00:02:27.410 --> 00:02:29.530 
and we could cut it all apart and cut
the<00:02:27.560> bottom<00:02:27.890> out<00:02:28.010> of<00:02:28.069> it<00:02:28.370> and<00:02:28.580> make<00:02:29.120> all<00:02:29.300> new

00:02:29.530 --> 00:02:29.540 
the bottom out of it and make all new

00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:32.350 
the bottom out of it and make all new
mounts<00:02:29.989> and<00:02:30.230> fix<00:02:31.040> all<00:02:31.250> the<00:02:31.400> dents<00:02:31.640> and<00:02:32.000> change

the<00:02:32.569> cap<00:02:32.780> and<00:02:33.110> everything<00:02:33.709> but<00:02:33.920> in<00:02:34.489> reality<00:02:34.760> it

00:02:35.199 --> 00:02:35.209 
the cap and everything but in reality it

00:02:35.209 --> 00:02:37.390 
the cap and everything but in reality it
would<00:02:35.269> probably<00:02:35.510> be<00:02:36.200> easier<00:02:36.230> to<00:02:36.800> start<00:02:37.099> from

00:02:37.390 --> 00:02:37.400 
would probably be easier to start from

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:39.820 
would probably be easier to start from
scratch<00:02:37.790> and<00:02:38.150> make<00:02:38.599> it<00:02:38.810> the<00:02:39.170> way<00:02:39.319> we<00:02:39.500> want<00:02:39.709> it

00:02:39.820 --> 00:02:39.830 
scratch and make it the way we want it

00:02:39.830 --> 00:02:42.820 
scratch and make it the way we want it
right<00:02:40.519> from<00:02:40.730> the<00:02:40.909> get-go<00:02:41.120> so<00:02:41.930> you<00:02:42.739> know

00:02:42.820 --> 00:02:42.830 
right from the get-go so you know

00:02:42.830 --> 00:02:46.390 
right from the get-go so you know
usually<00:02:43.280> with<00:02:44.090> sheetmetal<00:02:44.450> work<00:02:45.400> you

00:02:46.390 --> 00:02:46.400 
usually with sheetmetal work you

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:49.180 
usually with sheetmetal work you
separate<00:02:46.940> your<00:02:47.180> work<00:02:47.390> into<00:02:47.629> pieces<00:02:48.290> the<00:02:48.950> work

00:02:49.180 --> 00:02:49.190 
separate your work into pieces the work

00:02:49.190 --> 00:02:51.009 
separate your work into pieces the work
is<00:02:49.370> usually<00:02:49.580> pieced<00:02:50.030> out<00:02:50.239> where<00:02:50.599> the<00:02:50.750> most

00:02:51.009 --> 00:02:51.019 
is usually pieced out where the most

00:02:51.019 --> 00:02:54.460 
is usually pieced out where the most
extreme<00:02:51.650> radius<00:02:52.159> is<00:02:52.400> so<00:02:52.790> this<00:02:53.330> curve<00:02:53.720> here<00:02:54.319> is

00:02:54.460 --> 00:02:54.470 
extreme radius is so this curve here is

00:02:54.470 --> 00:02:58.440 
extreme radius is so this curve here is
where<00:02:55.370> we<00:02:55.550> have<00:02:55.760> the<00:02:55.970> most<00:02:56.180> extreme<00:02:56.599> radius<00:02:57.110> so

00:02:58.440 --> 00:02:58.450 
where we have the most extreme radius so

00:02:58.450 --> 00:03:00.820 
where we have the most extreme radius so
what<00:02:59.450> we<00:02:59.569> should<00:02:59.750> do<00:02:59.870> is<00:03:00.050> try<00:03:00.290> to<00:03:00.349> make<00:03:00.470> some

00:03:00.820 --> 00:03:00.830 
what we should do is try to make some

00:03:00.830 --> 00:03:03.559 
what we should do is try to make some
patterns<00:03:01.310> off<00:03:01.550> of<00:03:01.760> this

00:03:03.559 --> 00:03:03.569 
patterns off of this

00:03:03.569 --> 00:03:08.599 
patterns off of this
Oh<00:03:05.420> Venus<00:03:06.420> uses<00:03:06.930> this<00:03:07.140> regular<00:03:07.620> regular

00:03:08.599 --> 00:03:08.609 
Oh Venus uses this regular regular

00:03:08.609 --> 00:03:11.119 
Oh Venus uses this regular regular
tissue<00:03:08.879> paper<00:03:09.269> and<00:03:09.599> some<00:03:09.900> magnets<00:03:10.409> it's

00:03:11.119 --> 00:03:11.129 
tissue paper and some magnets it's

00:03:11.129 --> 00:03:14.119 
tissue paper and some magnets it's
pretty<00:03:11.459> simple<00:03:12.319> now<00:03:13.319> the<00:03:13.379> tissue<00:03:13.590> paper<00:03:13.739> will

00:03:14.119 --> 00:03:14.129 
pretty simple now the tissue paper will

00:03:14.129 --> 00:03:16.280 
pretty simple now the tissue paper will
almost<00:03:14.459> use<00:03:14.670> the<00:03:15.239> same<00:03:15.510> exact<00:03:16.019> thing<00:03:16.260> that

00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:16.290 
almost use the same exact thing that

00:03:16.290 --> 00:03:18.830 
almost use the same exact thing that
metal<00:03:16.829> will<00:03:17.010> do<00:03:17.219> you<00:03:17.430> know<00:03:17.549> it'll<00:03:17.819> only<00:03:17.999> it'll

00:03:18.830 --> 00:03:18.840 
metal will do you know it'll only it'll

00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:22.490 
metal will do you know it'll only it'll
only<00:03:19.230> lay<00:03:19.469> it<00:03:20.159> flat<00:03:20.969> to<00:03:21.420> a<00:03:21.450> certain<00:03:21.840> extent<00:03:22.230> and

00:03:22.490 --> 00:03:22.500 
only lay it flat to a certain extent and

00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:24.589 
only lay it flat to a certain extent and
where<00:03:22.680> the<00:03:22.799> to<00:03:22.950> shoot<00:03:23.189> paper<00:03:23.400> wrinkles<00:03:23.939> up<00:03:24.150> or

00:03:24.589 --> 00:03:24.599 
where the to shoot paper wrinkles up or

00:03:24.599 --> 00:03:26.720 
where the to shoot paper wrinkles up or
where<00:03:24.900> it<00:03:24.989> overlaps<00:03:25.290> that's<00:03:26.040> exactly<00:03:26.579> where

00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:26.730 
where it overlaps that's exactly where

00:03:26.730 --> 00:03:28.009 
where it overlaps that's exactly where
the<00:03:26.819> metal<00:03:27.120> is<00:03:27.150> going<00:03:27.329> to<00:03:27.420> need<00:03:27.750> to<00:03:27.870> be

00:03:28.009 --> 00:03:28.019 
the metal is going to need to be

00:03:28.019 --> 00:03:30.080 
the metal is going to need to be
shrunken<00:03:28.590> or<00:03:28.739> stretch<00:03:29.099> to<00:03:29.400> fit<00:03:29.430> and<00:03:29.790> we<00:03:29.849> kind

00:03:30.080 --> 00:03:30.090 
shrunken or stretch to fit and we kind

00:03:30.090 --> 00:03:33.739 
shrunken or stretch to fit and we kind
of<00:03:30.889> manipulate<00:03:31.889> it<00:03:32.099> and<00:03:32.280> get<00:03:33.030> it<00:03:33.120> to<00:03:33.299> fold<00:03:33.540> over

00:03:33.739 --> 00:03:33.749 
of manipulate it and get it to fold over

00:03:33.749 --> 00:03:35.750 
of manipulate it and get it to fold over
and<00:03:34.499> that'll<00:03:34.829> that'll<00:03:35.040> kind<00:03:35.430> of<00:03:35.549> tell<00:03:35.730> us

00:03:35.750 --> 00:03:35.760 
and that'll that'll kind of tell us

00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:40.069 
and that'll that'll kind of tell us
later<00:03:36.180> on<00:03:36.299> where<00:03:37.099> the<00:03:38.099> metal<00:03:38.459> is<00:03:38.489> gonna<00:03:39.079> need

00:03:40.069 --> 00:03:40.079 
later on where the metal is gonna need

00:03:40.079 --> 00:03:42.920 
later on where the metal is gonna need
some<00:03:40.139> work<00:03:40.650> done<00:03:40.859> to<00:03:41.129> it<00:03:41.419> so<00:03:42.419> now<00:03:42.449> we've<00:03:42.750> got

00:03:42.920 --> 00:03:42.930 
some work done to it so now we've got

00:03:42.930 --> 00:03:46.369 
some work done to it so now we've got
the<00:03:43.109> top<00:03:43.319> it's<00:03:43.709> laid<00:03:44.040> on<00:03:44.250> pretty<00:03:44.669> flat<00:03:44.969> so<00:03:45.379> what

00:03:46.369 --> 00:03:46.379 
the top it's laid on pretty flat so what

00:03:46.379 --> 00:03:49.009 
the top it's laid on pretty flat so what
we<00:03:46.469> need<00:03:46.620> to<00:03:46.680> do<00:03:46.859> is<00:03:47.549> kind<00:03:47.969> of<00:03:48.120> simulate<00:03:48.659> where

00:03:49.009 --> 00:03:49.019 
we need to do is kind of simulate where

00:03:49.019 --> 00:03:50.720 
we need to do is kind of simulate where
we<00:03:49.260> would<00:03:49.439> want<00:03:49.469> to<00:03:49.799> weld<00:03:49.980> it<00:03:50.189> or<00:03:50.310> where<00:03:50.489> we<00:03:50.609> add

00:03:50.720 --> 00:03:50.730 
we would want to weld it or where we add

00:03:50.730 --> 00:03:53.390 
we would want to weld it or where we add
one<00:03:50.939> to<00:03:51.090> cut<00:03:51.299> the<00:03:51.449> material<00:03:51.650> leaving<00:03:52.650> probably

00:03:53.390 --> 00:03:53.400 
one to cut the material leaving probably

00:03:53.400 --> 00:03:57.050 
one to cut the material leaving probably
an<00:03:54.590> extra<00:03:55.590> inch<00:03:55.949> or<00:03:56.189> so<00:03:56.430> the<00:03:56.609> weld<00:03:56.849> will

00:03:57.050 --> 00:03:57.060 
an extra inch or so the weld will

00:03:57.060 --> 00:03:58.550 
an extra inch or so the weld will
probably<00:03:57.419> end<00:03:57.540> up<00:03:57.659> being<00:03:57.719> here<00:03:58.109> in<00:03:58.230> the<00:03:58.290> middle

00:03:58.550 --> 00:03:58.560 
probably end up being here in the middle

00:03:58.560 --> 00:04:02.059 
probably end up being here in the middle
let's<00:03:59.010> make<00:03:59.219> another<00:03:59.370> mark<00:03:59.939> on<00:04:00.209> this<00:04:01.069> pattern

00:04:02.059 --> 00:04:02.069 
let's make another mark on this pattern

00:04:02.069 --> 00:04:05.539 
let's make another mark on this pattern
that<00:04:02.760> before<00:04:03.629> the<00:04:03.870> radius<00:04:04.260> starts<00:04:04.739> you<00:04:05.430> know

00:04:05.539 --> 00:04:05.549 
that before the radius starts you know

00:04:05.549 --> 00:04:07.939 
that before the radius starts you know
before<00:04:05.939> the<00:04:06.120> metal<00:04:06.419> starts<00:04:06.719> to<00:04:06.870> curve<00:04:07.139> over<00:04:07.650> on

00:04:07.939 --> 00:04:07.949 
before the metal starts to curve over on

00:04:07.949 --> 00:04:09.589 
before the metal starts to curve over on
the<00:04:08.699> edge<00:04:08.849> of<00:04:09.030> the<00:04:09.120> tank

00:04:09.589 --> 00:04:09.599 
the edge of the tank

00:04:09.599 --> 00:04:12.020 
the edge of the tank
and<00:04:10.470> that'll<00:04:10.769> show<00:04:10.799> us<00:04:11.159> when<00:04:11.370> we're<00:04:11.519> shrinking

00:04:12.020 --> 00:04:12.030 
and that'll show us when we're shrinking

00:04:12.030 --> 00:04:14.449 
and that'll show us when we're shrinking
it<00:04:12.209> how<00:04:12.870> deep<00:04:13.199> we<00:04:13.439> need<00:04:13.590> to<00:04:13.709> go<00:04:13.889> in<00:04:14.099> with<00:04:14.129> the

00:04:14.449 --> 00:04:14.459 
it how deep we need to go in with the

00:04:14.459 --> 00:04:17.860 
it how deep we need to go in with the
dies<00:04:15.079> will<00:04:16.079> kind<00:04:16.320> of<00:04:16.380> be<00:04:16.530> our<00:04:16.709> little<00:04:17.370> guide

00:04:17.860 --> 00:04:17.870 
dies will kind of be our little guide

00:04:17.870 --> 00:04:20.539 
dies will kind of be our little guide
always<00:04:18.870> give<00:04:19.079> yourself<00:04:19.199> about<00:04:19.769> an<00:04:19.949> extra<00:04:20.310> inch

00:04:20.539 --> 00:04:20.549 
always give yourself about an extra inch

00:04:20.549 --> 00:04:21.860 
always give yourself about an extra inch
of<00:04:20.699> material<00:04:20.820> that<00:04:21.269> you<00:04:21.329> can<00:04:21.599> trim<00:04:21.840> off

00:04:21.860 --> 00:04:21.870 
of material that you can trim off

00:04:21.870 --> 00:04:23.870 
of material that you can trim off
because<00:04:22.710> a<00:04:22.740> good<00:04:22.979> part<00:04:23.220> of<00:04:23.310> the<00:04:23.400> metal<00:04:23.699> will<00:04:23.849> be

00:04:23.870 --> 00:04:23.880 
because a good part of the metal will be

00:04:23.880 --> 00:04:27.379 
because a good part of the metal will be
distorted<00:04:24.539> from<00:04:24.690> the<00:04:24.870> machines

00:04:27.379 --> 00:04:27.389 

00:04:27.389 --> 00:04:30.020 

add<00:04:28.199> an<00:04:28.500> extra<00:04:28.770> quarter<00:04:29.099> inch<00:04:29.340> into<00:04:29.759> the<00:04:29.789> width

00:04:30.020 --> 00:04:30.030 
add an extra quarter inch into the width

00:04:30.030 --> 00:04:32.439 
add an extra quarter inch into the width
of<00:04:30.180> your<00:04:30.330> design<00:04:30.689> you'll<00:04:31.289> need<00:04:31.500> it<00:04:31.650> later<00:04:31.800> on

00:04:32.439 --> 00:04:32.449 
of your design you'll need it later on

00:04:32.449 --> 00:04:40.100 
of your design you'll need it later on
so<00:04:33.449> that<00:04:33.569> should<00:04:33.750> be<00:04:33.780> our<00:04:33.960> pattern<00:04:38.930> this<00:04:39.930> is

00:04:40.100 --> 00:04:40.110 
so that should be our pattern this is

00:04:40.110 --> 00:04:45.110 
so that should be our pattern this is
just<00:04:40.729> 18<00:04:41.729> gauge<00:04:42.289> coal<00:04:43.289> rolled<00:04:43.590> steel<00:04:43.949> and<00:04:44.340> it

00:04:45.110 --> 00:04:45.120 
just 18 gauge coal rolled steel and it

00:04:45.120 --> 00:04:46.730 
just 18 gauge coal rolled steel and it
Steel's<00:04:45.449> pretty<00:04:45.780> forgiving<00:04:46.289> because<00:04:46.439> this<00:04:46.590> is

00:04:46.730 --> 00:04:46.740 
Steel's pretty forgiving because this is

00:04:46.740 --> 00:04:48.700 
Steel's pretty forgiving because this is
a<00:04:46.770> pretty<00:04:47.069> beat-up<00:04:47.430> piece<00:04:47.879> that's<00:04:48.210> had<00:04:48.360> some

00:04:48.700 --> 00:04:48.710 
a pretty beat-up piece that's had some

00:04:48.710 --> 00:04:51.140 
a pretty beat-up piece that's had some
English<00:04:49.710> wheeling<00:04:50.189> done<00:04:50.400> on<00:04:50.580> it<00:04:50.759> so<00:04:50.969> now<00:04:51.120> I

English wheeling done on it so now I

00:04:51.150 --> 00:04:52.459 
English wheeling done on it so now I
mean<00:04:51.419> the<00:04:51.780> most<00:04:51.870> important<00:04:52.229> part<00:04:52.379> is

00:04:52.459 --> 00:04:52.469 
mean the most important part is

00:04:52.469 --> 00:04:55.279 
mean the most important part is
developing<00:04:52.889> the<00:04:53.009> pattern<00:04:53.539> for<00:04:54.539> your<00:04:54.659> top<00:04:54.900> so

00:04:55.279 --> 00:04:55.289 
developing the pattern for your top so

00:04:55.289 --> 00:04:57.679 
developing the pattern for your top so
now<00:04:55.500> we<00:04:55.889> know<00:04:56.189> that<00:04:56.550> this<00:04:56.969> this<00:04:57.270> whole<00:04:57.509> edge

00:04:57.679 --> 00:04:57.689 
now we know that this this whole edge

00:04:57.689 --> 00:04:59.689 
now we know that this this whole edge
right<00:04:57.930> here<00:04:57.990> is<00:04:58.289> going<00:04:58.409> to<00:04:58.500> be<00:04:58.800> what's<00:04:59.400> needs

00:04:59.689 --> 00:04:59.699 
right here is going to be what's needs

00:04:59.699 --> 00:05:01.369 
right here is going to be what's needs
to<00:04:59.849> be<00:04:59.969> shrunk<00:05:00.330> and<00:05:00.539> this<00:05:00.719> whole<00:05:00.930> edge<00:05:01.110> right

00:05:01.369 --> 00:05:01.379 
to be shrunk and this whole edge right

00:05:01.379 --> 00:05:03.559 
to be shrunk and this whole edge right
here<00:05:01.590> is<00:05:01.710> what<00:05:01.949> needs<00:05:02.099> to<00:05:02.279> remain<00:05:02.879> relatively

00:05:03.559 --> 00:05:03.569 
here is what needs to remain relatively

00:05:03.569 --> 00:05:08.360 
here is what needs to remain relatively
flat<00:05:05.840> this<00:05:06.840> prep<00:05:07.110> may<00:05:07.319> be<00:05:07.379> boring<00:05:07.740> but<00:05:08.219> it's

flat this prep may be boring but it's

00:05:08.370 --> 00:05:10.129 
flat this prep may be boring but it's
important<00:05:08.939> so<00:05:09.150> you<00:05:09.240> don't<00:05:09.419> screw<00:05:09.719> up<00:05:09.870> later

00:05:10.129 --> 00:05:10.139 
important so you don't screw up later

00:05:10.139 --> 00:05:12.439 
important so you don't screw up later
we'll<00:05:11.039> get<00:05:11.189> into<00:05:11.370> the<00:05:11.550> cool<00:05:11.759> stuff<00:05:12.090> soon

00:05:12.439 --> 00:05:12.449 
we'll get into the cool stuff soon

00:05:12.449 --> 00:05:16.219 
we'll get into the cool stuff soon
enough<00:05:13.939> use<00:05:14.939> magnets<00:05:15.419> to<00:05:15.509> hold<00:05:15.750> your<00:05:15.900> pattern

enough use magnets to hold your pattern
in<00:05:16.379> place<00:05:16.620> then<00:05:17.580> trace<00:05:17.939> over<00:05:18.150> the<00:05:18.270> steel<00:05:18.629> I<00:05:18.900> use

00:05:19.519 --> 00:05:19.529 
in place then trace over the steel I use

00:05:19.529 --> 00:05:21.230 
in place then trace over the steel I use
the<00:05:19.770> straight<00:05:20.039> edge<00:05:20.189> of<00:05:20.310> the<00:05:20.460> pattern<00:05:20.729> lined

00:05:21.230 --> 00:05:21.240 
the straight edge of the pattern lined

00:05:21.240 --> 00:05:22.429 
the straight edge of the pattern lined
up<00:05:21.389> with<00:05:21.509> the<00:05:21.599> straight<00:05:21.870> edge<00:05:22.020> of<00:05:22.139> the<00:05:22.199> metal

00:05:22.429 --> 00:05:22.439 
up with the straight edge of the metal

00:05:22.439 --> 00:05:25.580 
up with the straight edge of the metal
to<00:05:22.919> save<00:05:23.129> cutting<00:05:23.550> time

00:05:25.580 --> 00:05:25.590 
to save cutting time

00:05:25.590 --> 00:05:28.230 
to save cutting time
for<00:05:26.590> the<00:05:26.680> inner<00:05:26.860> radius<00:05:27.100> uses<00:05:27.760> center<00:05:28.030> punch

00:05:28.230 --> 00:05:28.240 
for the inner radius uses center punch

00:05:28.240 --> 00:05:29.880 
for the inner radius uses center punch
to<00:05:28.450> mark<00:05:28.660> some<00:05:28.840> sight<00:05:29.110> lines<00:05:29.380> off<00:05:29.680> your

00:05:29.880 --> 00:05:29.890 
to mark some sight lines off your

00:05:29.890 --> 00:05:38.880 
to mark some sight lines off your
pattern<00:05:30.250> then<00:05:30.940> cut

00:05:38.880 --> 00:05:38.890 

00:05:38.890 --> 00:05:42.790 

so<00:05:39.890> our<00:05:39.980> pattern<00:05:40.750> so<00:05:41.750> here's<00:05:41.990> our<00:05:42.110> flat<00:05:42.320> spot

00:05:42.790 --> 00:05:42.800 
so our pattern so here's our flat spot

00:05:42.800 --> 00:05:44.830 
so our pattern so here's our flat spot
on<00:05:42.950> the<00:05:43.070> center<00:05:43.460> so<00:05:43.700> we<00:05:43.850> make<00:05:44.060> we're<00:05:44.720> just

00:05:44.830 --> 00:05:44.840 
on the center so we make we're just

00:05:44.840 --> 00:05:47.740 
on the center so we make we're just
gonna<00:05:44.990> set<00:05:45.320> a<00:05:45.350> little<00:05:45.650> guide<00:05:46.180> to<00:05:47.180> make<00:05:47.390> sure<00:05:47.600> we

00:05:47.740 --> 00:05:47.750 
gonna set a little guide to make sure we

00:05:47.750 --> 00:05:50.350 
gonna set a little guide to make sure we
don't<00:05:47.900> shrink<00:05:48.560> any<00:05:49.250> more<00:05:49.580> than<00:05:49.910> that

00:05:50.350 --> 00:05:50.360 
don't shrink any more than that

00:05:50.360 --> 00:05:56.890 
don't shrink any more than that
actual<00:05:52.300> distance<00:05:53.300> so

00:05:56.890 --> 00:05:56.900 

00:05:56.900 --> 00:05:59.379 

this<00:05:57.590> mark<00:05:57.919> is<00:05:58.070> your<00:05:58.250> guide<00:05:58.430> so<00:05:58.820> don't<00:05:59.060> go<00:05:59.210> past

00:05:59.379 --> 00:05:59.389 
this mark is your guide so don't go past

00:05:59.389 --> 00:06:01.540 
this mark is your guide so don't go past
it<00:05:59.660> when<00:05:59.810> you<00:05:59.900> feed<00:06:00.110> it<00:06:00.229> into<00:06:00.380> the<00:06:00.470> machines<00:06:00.889> it

00:06:01.540 --> 00:06:01.550 
it when you feed it into the machines it

00:06:01.550 --> 00:06:03.550 
it when you feed it into the machines it
keeps<00:06:01.940> it<00:06:02.150> balanced<00:06:02.600> on<00:06:02.690> both<00:06:02.720> sides<00:06:03.229> so<00:06:03.530> it

00:06:03.550 --> 00:06:03.560 
keeps it balanced on both sides so it

00:06:03.560 --> 00:06:06.310 
keeps it balanced on both sides so it
turns<00:06:03.919> out<00:06:04.100> symmetrical<00:06:05.020> what<00:06:06.020> needs<00:06:06.229> to

00:06:06.310 --> 00:06:06.320 
turns out symmetrical what needs to

00:06:06.320 --> 00:06:11.580 
turns out symmetrical what needs to
happen<00:06:07.419> this<00:06:08.419> is<00:06:08.600> our<00:06:08.750> mouth<00:06:08.930> so<00:06:09.910> this<00:06:10.910> edge

00:06:11.580 --> 00:06:11.590 
happen this is our mouth so this edge

00:06:11.590 --> 00:06:14.980 
happen this is our mouth so this edge
needs<00:06:12.590> to<00:06:12.800> be<00:06:12.919> pulled<00:06:13.220> down<00:06:13.690> because<00:06:14.690> this<00:06:14.840> is

00:06:14.980 --> 00:06:14.990 
needs to be pulled down because this is

00:06:14.990 --> 00:06:16.719 
needs to be pulled down because this is
a<00:06:15.020> shape<00:06:15.380> that's<00:06:15.590> bending<00:06:16.009> two<00:06:16.220> ways<00:06:16.430> it's

00:06:16.719 --> 00:06:16.729 
a shape that's bending two ways it's

00:06:16.729 --> 00:06:18.939 
a shape that's bending two ways it's
it's<00:06:17.060> curving<00:06:17.419> around<00:06:17.720> the<00:06:17.990> radius<00:06:18.350> and<00:06:18.590> it's

00:06:18.939 --> 00:06:18.949 
it's curving around the radius and it's

00:06:18.949 --> 00:06:21.340 
it's curving around the radius and it's
folding<00:06:19.430> over<00:06:19.759> so<00:06:20.539> we<00:06:20.660> need<00:06:20.810> to<00:06:20.900> use<00:06:21.080> some

00:06:21.340 --> 00:06:21.350 
folding over so we need to use some

00:06:21.350 --> 00:06:25.719 
folding over so we need to use some
machines<00:06:22.120> to<00:06:23.120> it<00:06:23.330> to<00:06:24.289> shape<00:06:24.530> that<00:06:24.770> so<00:06:25.100> right

00:06:25.719 --> 00:06:25.729 
machines to it to shape that so right

00:06:25.729 --> 00:06:28.450 
machines to it to shape that so right
while<00:06:26.210> we're<00:06:26.389> worried<00:06:26.630> about<00:06:26.690> is<00:06:26.870> from<00:06:27.460> where

00:06:28.450 --> 00:06:28.460 
while we're worried about is from where

00:06:28.460 --> 00:06:31.360 
while we're worried about is from where
the<00:06:28.490> turn<00:06:28.910> starts<00:06:29.770> which<00:06:30.770> is<00:06:30.800> right<00:06:31.160> about

00:06:31.360 --> 00:06:31.370 
the turn starts which is right about

00:06:31.370 --> 00:06:31.779 
the turn starts which is right about
here

00:06:31.779 --> 00:06:31.789 
here

00:06:31.789 --> 00:06:36.850 
here
so<00:06:32.780> we'll<00:06:33.460> take<00:06:34.460> that<00:06:34.669> over<00:06:35.000> to<00:06:35.030> the<00:06:35.860> little

00:06:36.850 --> 00:06:36.860 
so we'll take that over to the little

00:06:36.860 --> 00:06:40.659 
so we'll take that over to the little
Pettingill

00:06:40.659 --> 00:06:40.669 

00:06:40.669 --> 00:06:42.730 

now<00:06:41.240> that<00:06:41.389> we've<00:06:41.509> cut<00:06:41.719> our<00:06:41.840> top<00:06:42.050> piece<00:06:42.289> to<00:06:42.319> size

00:06:42.730 --> 00:06:42.740 
now that we've cut our top piece to size

00:06:42.740 --> 00:06:44.950 
now that we've cut our top piece to size
the<00:06:43.430> next<00:06:43.460> step<00:06:43.939> is<00:06:44.120> to<00:06:44.240> start<00:06:44.479> forming<00:06:44.780> the

00:06:44.950 --> 00:06:44.960 
the next step is to start forming the

00:06:44.960 --> 00:06:52.320 
the next step is to start forming the
metal<00:06:45.289> to<00:06:45.409> shape

00:06:52.320 --> 00:06:52.330 

00:06:52.330 --> 00:06:54.389
