teeth because you know dental hygiene is
important<00:02:46.550> so<00:02:46.850> I<00:02:46.880> use<00:02:47.360> the<00:02:47.620> crest<00:02:48.620> 3d<00:02:48.920> white

00:02:49.320 --> 00:02:49.330

00:02:49.330 --> 00:02:51.760 
important so I use the crest 3d white
whitening<00:02:50.330> toothpaste<00:02:50.720> and<00:02:50.930> I<00:02:51.320> think<00:02:51.680> it

00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:51.770 
whitening toothpaste and I think it

00:02:51.770 --> 00:02:53.050 
whitening toothpaste and I think it
works<00:02:51.920> pretty<00:02:52.070> well<00:02:52.190> I<00:02:52.459> don't<00:02:52.550> know<00:02:52.730> it<00:02:52.910> gets
