huge<00:00:57.140> amount<00:00:57.469> of<00:00:57.500> coverage<00:00:57.829> but<00:00:58.370> there's<00:00:58.579> a

00:00:58.630 --> 00:00:58.640 
huge amount of coverage but there's a

00:00:58.640 --> 00:01:00.939 
huge amount of coverage but there's a
loop<00:00:58.820> up<00:00:59.030> top<00:00:59.329> and<00:00:59.570> they're<00:00:59.690> designed<00:01:00.110> to<00:01:00.350> tie

00:01:00.939 --> 00:01:00.949 
loop up top and they're designed to tie

00:01:00.949 --> 00:01:05.529 
loop up top and they're designed to tie
back<00:01:00.980> like<00:01:01.520> this<00:01:02.649> all<00:01:03.649> forums<00:01:04.309> and<00:01:04.699> then<00:01:05.270> in<00:01:05.449> a

00:01:05.529 --> 00:01:05.539 
back like this all forums and then in a

00:01:05.539 --> 00:01:09.249 
back like this all forums and then in a
storm<00:01:05.869> you<00:01:06.350> can<00:01:06.560> swing<00:01:06.830> them<00:01:06.920> down<00:01:08.140> bring<00:01:09.140> them

00:01:09.249 --> 00:01:09.259 
storm you can swing them down bring them

00:01:09.259 --> 00:01:12.570 
storm you can swing them down bring them
in<00:01:09.440> and<00:01:09.740> tie<00:01:10.520> them<00:01:10.580> together<00:01:10.850> like<00:01:11.150> this<00:01:11.570> and

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:12.580 
in and tie them together like this and

00:01:12.580 --> 00:01:15.100 
in and tie them together like this and
it<00:01:13.580> closes<00:01:13.939> off<00:01:14.240> the<00:01:14.299> end<00:01:14.540> and<00:01:14.630> keeps<00:01:14.840> the<00:01:14.960> wind

00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:15.110 
it closes off the end and keeps the wind

00:01:15.110 --> 00:01:18.490 
it closes off the end and keeps the wind
