00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:28.680 
in your backpack this is what you're

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:32.120 
in your backpack this is what you're
gonna<00:01:28.799> see<00:01:29.130> so<00:01:30.350> what<00:01:31.350> we're<00:01:31.470> gonna<00:01:31.530> do<00:01:31.799> first

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:32.130 
gonna see so what we're gonna do first

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:34.039 
gonna see so what we're gonna do first
is<00:01:32.579> we're<00:01:32.790> going<00:01:32.880> to<00:01:32.939> click<00:01:33.119> on<00:01:33.270> new<00:01:33.450> weapon

00:03:30.949 --> 00:03:30.959 
oh that's because I did it before and I

00:03:30.959 --> 00:03:32.899 
oh that's because I did it before and I
found<00:03:31.620> out<00:03:31.799> I<00:03:31.829> actually<00:03:32.040> wasn't<00:03:32.340> recording

00:03:32.899 --> 00:03:32.909 
found out I actually wasn't recording

00:03:35.569 --> 00:03:35.579 
sealing me but you can see that it's

00:03:35.579 --> 00:03:38.689 
sealing me but you can see that it's
level<00:03:35.759> 26<00:03:36.479> just<00:03:36.930> like<00:03:37.109> my<00:03:37.650> character<00:03:38.370> you<00:03:38.579> can

00:03:38.689 --> 00:03:38.699 
level 26 just like my character you can

00:03:38.699 --> 00:03:41.089 
level 26 just like my character you can
see<00:03:38.849> the<00:03:38.939> damage<00:03:39.180> accuracy<00:03:39.989> fire<00:03:40.590> rate<00:03:40.919> and

00:03:41.089 --> 00:03:41.099 
see the damage accuracy fire rate and

00:03:41.099 --> 00:03:43.879 
see the damage accuracy fire rate and
the<00:03:42.030> electrocute<00:03:42.569> damage<00:03:42.930> per<00:03:43.349> second<00:03:43.769> is

00:03:43.879 --> 00:03:43.889 
the electrocute damage per second is

00:03:43.889 --> 00:03:45.679 
the electrocute damage per second is
actually<00:03:44.040> really<00:03:44.459> higher<00:03:44.790> there<00:03:45.120> there's

00:03:45.679 --> 00:03:45.689 
actually really higher there there's

00:03:45.689 --> 00:03:47.780 
actually really higher there there's
slightly<00:03:45.959> different<00:03:46.470> weapons<00:03:46.919> so<00:03:47.280> it<00:03:47.549> is<00:03:47.759> a

00:03:47.780 --> 00:03:47.790 
slightly different weapons so it is a

00:03:47.790 --> 00:03:51.050 
slightly different weapons so it is a
little<00:03:48.209> bit<00:03:48.329> random<00:03:48.569> every<00:03:48.959> time<00:03:49.729> but<00:03:50.729> you<00:03:50.909> can

00:03:51.050 --> 00:03:51.060 
little bit random every time but you can

00:03:51.060 --> 00:03:53.089 
little bit random every time but you can
