00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.799
 and everything else at the beginning I started singing 

00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:06.750
 in small events and in discos but 

00:00:04.799 --> 00:00:08.519
 I take it more seriously when I win the 

00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:12.360
 contest in the search for don omar 

00:00:08.519 --> 00:00:14.190
 Peruvian in a national urban radio 

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:16.020
 my life was urban music but I 

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:18.180
 I walked away from that because I had to earn more 

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:20.300
 money aside because my son was coming in 

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:20.300
 path 

00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:40.430
 and last chance and I'm not going to 

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:44.820
 to waste I also come from neighborhood 

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:48.390
 to become the king I am tomás 

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:51.300
 I have prepared ready that he sings worth 

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:54.590
 when you 

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:54.590
 number all 

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:06.339
 I am don omar the king 

00:01:09.460 --> 00:01:17.100
 really up 

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:21.770
 digital 

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:30.530
 so that it becomes in the headquarters 

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:30.530
 The normal thing is that it slips 

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:38.930
 to move on TV 

00:01:35.750 --> 00:01:41.870
 motivates the abnormal is that you see the 

00:01:38.930 --> 00:01:44.990
 chromatin from a corner like 

00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:47.510
 that in the end murders the end right away 

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:51.580
 dress and make up the girl 

00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:51.580
 you feel today you fall 

00:01:53.110 --> 00:01:56.110
 visit 

00:01:57.230 --> 00:02:02.020
 you do not go damme 

00:01:59.120 --> 00:02:02.020
 and dale 

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:07.220
 to move on the street 

00:02:07.870 --> 00:02:11.160
 and that we repair 

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:19.870
 to move on the street 

00:02:16.390 --> 00:02:22.150
 massive the abnormal is the one that slips 

00:02:19.870 --> 00:02:24.390
 Mom tells me that tonight touches the 

00:02:22.150 --> 00:02:24.390
 gag 

00:02:24.550 --> 00:02:29.620
 when we get back to dt 

00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:43.989
 and also loose as 

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:43.989
 I said mommy tonight 

00:02:45.100 --> 00:02:49.710
 when passing the sharp monsalvete 

00:02:52.250 --> 00:02:54.550

00:02:55.290 --> 00:02:59.430
 then I ask also loose as each 

00:02:57.659 --> 00:03:04.969

00:02:59.430 --> 00:03:04.969
 I am whistle her friend from heaven 

00:03:05.319 --> 00:03:11.800
 How hard it is that you do not like my videos 

00:03:07.930 --> 00:03:14.790
 that's why I 'm not me, I see myself now 

00:03:11.800 --> 00:03:14.790
 girlfriend is enough 

00:03:18.110 --> 00:03:22.990
 since it is corn and italy 

00:03:24.450 --> 00:03:27.560
 so they move 

00:03:28.720 --> 00:03:31.830
 that slide 

00:03:34.790 --> 00:03:38.019
 because I am very good talk 

00:03:40.670 --> 00:03:44.300

00:03:43.010 --> 00:03:46.800
 to see you 

00:03:44.300 --> 00:03:50.000

00:03:46.800 --> 00:03:50.000

00:03:51.090 --> 00:03:55.700
 to 

00:03:52.770 --> 00:03:55.700
 of death 

00:04:02.290 --> 00:04:05.459
 I will do this to you 

00:04:06.140 --> 00:04:09.370
 so much going on 

00:04:20.650 --> 00:04:25.380
 the only Czech history 

00:04:31.670 --> 00:04:34.180

00:04:59.689 --> 00:05:06.860
 Come here Mr. Frank Vega 

00:05:02.110 --> 00:05:08.509
 our gift omar knight open a 

00:05:06.860 --> 00:05:11.649
 presentation open the galas of them 

00:05:08.509 --> 00:05:11.649
 today is not easy 

00:05:11.739 --> 00:05:15.849
 you are aware of what was done well 

00:05:18.339 --> 00:05:22.249
 effectively let's see let's see the 

00:05:20.360 --> 00:05:24.319
 word with its post to our curing 

00:05:22.249 --> 00:05:26.179
 we started with the birthday girl the 

00:05:24.319 --> 00:05:28.610
 beautiful is in color and you follow 

00:05:26.179 --> 00:05:31.360
 linda castilla for him and thanks to 

00:05:28.610 --> 00:05:31.360
 said franz 

00:05:31.580 --> 00:05:36.610
 I know it's difficult is the first voice 

00:05:34.580 --> 00:05:40.069
 it can be broken and if indeed 

00:05:36.610 --> 00:05:43.460
 He lacked a little more consistency 

00:05:40.069 --> 00:05:45.500
 the voice plus weight to the sea fertilizer that 

00:05:43.460 --> 00:05:48.439
 look more you are not any imitator in 

00:05:45.500 --> 00:05:50.719
 Nomás this you have to believe the I 

00:05:48.439 --> 00:05:52.939
 I think that being the first gala is 

00:05:50.719 --> 00:05:55.610
 normal to be nervous but I hope to see 

00:05:52.939 --> 00:05:58.009
 a job here later because as 

00:05:55.610 --> 00:06:01.689
 there are so many artists and the elimination goes 

00:05:58.009 --> 00:06:01.689
 to be so drastic 

00:06:04.120 --> 00:06:11.919
 and gastric removal if not a candy 

00:06:09.349 --> 00:06:11.919
 I will not take 

00:06:16.270 --> 00:06:25.729
 this thanks then we go until 10 

00:06:20.210 --> 00:06:28.669
 of the next night is the novelon very 

00:06:25.729 --> 00:06:33.279
 ok but I think you should see this 

00:06:28.669 --> 00:06:33.279
 the video and improve the things that you've 

00:06:34.750 --> 00:06:40.389
 and thank you 

00:06:42.639 --> 00:06:46.389
 Maricarmen Marín 

00:06:46.659 --> 00:06:52.400
 to make a first presentation I 

00:06:49.729 --> 00:06:54.169
 it seems that it has come out very safe very well 

00:06:52.400 --> 00:06:56.719
 I liked what I do have to 

00:06:54.169 --> 00:06:59.180
 be careful who is going out 

00:06:56.719 --> 00:07:00.979
 energy and we need you got me 

00:06:59.180 --> 00:07:04.039
 with the energy of don omar that does not dance 

00:07:00.979 --> 00:07:06.289
 a lot of times for dancing is gone 

00:07:04.039 --> 00:07:07.849
 a little voice for the fatigue that 

00:07:06.289 --> 00:07:10.069
 control the air better but it has 

00:07:07.849 --> 00:07:11.629
 seemed like a good presentation we are going to 

00:07:10.069 --> 00:07:14.300
 polish those details and we're going to 

00:07:11.629 --> 00:07:16.099
 forward usually comment and norme ricardo 

00:07:14.300 --> 00:07:18.469
 we heard it I agree with mari carmen 

00:07:16.099 --> 00:07:20.389
 I think they have the dance and you wear 

00:07:18.469 --> 00:07:23.150
 to dance you start dancing 

00:07:20.389 --> 00:07:24.409
 frank vega no no no sea well planted in 

00:07:23.150 --> 00:07:26.360
 the stage taking the pace but not 

00:07:24.409 --> 00:07:27.889
 Dancing so much and you have passed bill 

00:07:26.360 --> 00:07:30.110
 the second half of the song had 

00:07:27.889 --> 00:07:32.000
 you had little air because you were agitated 

00:07:30.110 --> 00:07:34.009
 control that to improve imitation 

00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:35.210
 excellent comments you know to 

00:07:34.009 --> 00:07:40.180
 to get better 

00:07:35.210 --> 00:07:40.180
 for her while we remember
