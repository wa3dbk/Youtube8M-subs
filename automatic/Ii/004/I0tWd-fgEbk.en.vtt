00:00:00.329 --> 00:00:04.640
 the law is for additional night overtime in many cases the right was 

00:00:04.640 --> 00:00:09.120
 recognized in justice this was the case of a teacher enedina generals 

00:00:10.599 --> 00:00:15.689
 changing the day by night there are those who prefer to work while most people 

00:00:15.689 --> 00:00:16.529
 It's ok 

00:00:16.529 --> 00:00:21.489
 the reverse lifestyle at the end of the month guarantees a higher salary than the 

00:00:21.489 --> 00:00:24.099
 the same day 

00:00:24.099 --> 00:00:28.329
 This is because, according to the consolidation of labor laws, the 

00:00:28.329 --> 00:00:34.510
 in these cases it should be 20% over the hour worked called 

00:00:34.510 --> 00:00:39.550
 for this biologist who worked the night for five years 

00:00:39.550 --> 00:00:42.909
 I just agree that the process should receive the nightly surcharge 

00:00:43.570 --> 00:00:47.770
 utility in labor law clt is an acquired right 

00:00:48.540 --> 00:00:53.110
 this is a right acquired per person has that right that he works night 

00:00:53.110 --> 00:00:53.970
 it is day 

00:00:53.970 --> 00:00:58.060
 it was just that but it is not always so international, for example the teacher 

00:00:58.060 --> 00:01:01.310
 had to bring justice to receive the additional nightly 

00:01:01.930 --> 00:01:06.340
 the institution came to rely on the argument that there is a regulation 

00:01:06.340 --> 00:01:08.520
 category-specific 

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:12.990
 which does not provide for payment of the benefit because it considers that such 

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:17.380
 The regulation does not withdraw the right provided for in the 

00:01:17.380 --> 00:01:21.600
 labor court determined the payment of the night 

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:24.790
 teacher with interest and monetary correction 

00:01:24.790 --> 00:01:29.130
 in brasÃ­lia survey of teachers union in establishments 

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:34.590
 education reveals that of the city's 13,000 teachers, seven thousand 

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:36.530
 currently top bells' 

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:43.230
 of this total 90% work at night and although the benefit is legal some 

00:01:43.229 --> 00:01:48.230
 institutions are using maneuvers to circumvent the law I am using from 

00:01:48.229 --> 00:01:49.490
 artifice 

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:51.400
 furthermore added 

00:01:51.400 --> 00:01:57.610
 the agent, nothing at the beginning of the classes, money is needed on the river, it goes up to the 

00:01:57.610 --> 00:01:59.080
 10 hours and runs away 

00:01:59.080 --> 00:02:02.960
 to escape the payment of the nightly surcharge this is the big problem that 

00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:07.290
 has happened, said the lawyer explains that many educational institutions do not 

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:10.330
 pay the benefit based on a convention of the organization 

00:02:10.330 --> 00:02:12.320
 International Labor Organization 

00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:14.100
 of which the nocturnal additional 

00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:18.850
 is between midnight and 5 am he warns that the 

00:02:18.850 --> 00:02:22.740
 educational institution and give the benefit is subject to penalties 

00:02:22.740 --> 00:02:25.740
 Article 57 of the 

00:02:26.249 --> 00:02:28.659
 Hi, they disappoint the conditions. 

00:02:28.659 --> 00:02:31.149
 dreams 

00:02:31.149 --> 00:02:35.659
 granting some of the benefits of later evening extra ado would be one of them 

00:02:36.409 --> 00:02:40.629
 now this is exceptional for what those segments say 

00:02:40.629 --> 00:02:45.489
 professions that have incomes with the regime slides themselves and where 

00:02:45.489 --> 00:02:48.679
 night production remuneration is already contemplated 

00:02:48.679 --> 00:02:53.559
 why the rule laid down in the standard, in particular because it applies the 

00:02:53.559 --> 00:02:54.969
 general character 

00:02:54.969 --> 00:02:59.019
 so he basically will welcome people who work 

00:02:59.889 --> 00:03:01.829
 not specific regulations 

00:03:01.829 --> 00:03:03.819
 the teachers 

00:03:03.819 --> 00:03:04.959
 yesterday for example 

00:03:04.959 --> 00:03:08.459
 which is the case raises doubts years 

00:03:08.459 --> 00:03:12.439
 they have in the specific regime but in the specific regime of them lady 

00:03:12.439 --> 00:03:15.929
 night work regulations therefore 

00:03:15.929 --> 00:03:17.329
 they against the general rule
