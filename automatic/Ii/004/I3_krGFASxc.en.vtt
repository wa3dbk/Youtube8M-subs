00:00:10.250 --> 00:00:17.220
 only joy in youtube beauty that fails 

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:19.109
 unique and takes a while to ensure that 

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:20.279
 they will not bring video to the channel I'm going 

00:00:19.109 --> 00:00:21.510
 explain to you why I'm not 

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:23.730
 bringing a daily video to you 

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:25.590
 back to your normal routine but I'm just 

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:27.539
 stabilizing in schedules 

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:28.769
 I'll tell you already now the line 

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:30.000
 my first impressions of the 

00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:31.800
 Guardian but I will not be able to bring 

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.300
 video gameplay I 'm going to talk to 

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:35.579
 You're going to be kind exchange ideas with 

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:37.230
 You know to tell me what I found of you. 

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:39.090
 game for the one with the alpha version 

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:40.770
 subscribe in the comments what you found 

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:42.870
 to discuss to see this game 

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:44.280
 it's worth it to set an example for 

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:46.710
 the people who want to buy to see if 

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:48.809
 a good value for money is a good thing 

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:50.969
 who will know that you're only going to like it 

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:52.739
 play and such I speak my opinion to 

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:55.170
 guys on that video first when 

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:56.969
 I joined the character who you are. 

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:58.859
 has for several ways that 

00:00:56.969 --> 00:01:00.359
 character you think you have 33 

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:02.609
 feature to create the face of the 

00:01:00.359 --> 00:01:05.040
 character and has three carts 

00:01:02.609 --> 00:01:06.420
 blouse and pants tennis is something that 

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:08.549
 I find a negative point I think I think 

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:10.710
 that should have more is how to customize the 

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:11.820
 your character because how to customize 

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:13.770
 but because I think everything stays the same 

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:15.509
 the characters know I think it should 

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:17.970
 take those things and change the face pull 

00:01:15.509 --> 00:01:20.070
 this the mouth tea put the color of the clothes and 

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:21.659
 such but does not say an alpha version to 

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:23.729
 people do not know he can throw can 

00:01:21.659 --> 00:01:25.710
 launch a pack with a million clothes one 

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:27.570
 million heads 1 million hair 

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:29.310
 among other things then he was the 

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:31.320
 negative point for me but it was not a 

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:33.270
 negative point so great that point we 

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:36.150
 or to play the game is not a thing 

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:38.549
 basic is just a matter of character 

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:41.340
 same right and when he entered the game and 

00:01:38.549 --> 00:01:43.860
 Such a game is with some led types of law 

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:45.720
 to enter the server because the size 

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:47.759
 What bug and such are you trying to get through 

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:49.290
 serbian balzer you look for server there and 

00:01:47.759 --> 00:01:51.060
 When you were you click to 

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:51.780
 enter the server city where the 

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:53.759
 server 

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:55.710
 the server says it's crowded there you 

00:01:53.759 --> 00:01:57.119
 have to travel only in quicken joy 

00:01:55.710 --> 00:01:59.040
 for those who do not know what it is that john 

00:01:57.119 --> 00:02:00.299
 search for a server automatically 

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:02.700
 that there is a vacancy left for 

00:02:00.299 --> 00:02:04.229
 then only fit it for this day that the 

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:06.810
 people can play could not play with 

00:02:04.229 --> 00:02:09.569
 A friend of mine is playing. I warned him 

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:12.480
 Rhodium Rhythmic beetle is playing Kings 25 

00:02:09.569 --> 00:02:13.830
 is playing victor of the clan of being 

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:15.390
 playing black gaston too 

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:17.100
 Who wants to donate to be joaber? 

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:20.400
 of DNA and will also use that is what 

00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:22.560
 not only that of sweet rice for me was 

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:25.170
 one of one of the clan's fucking more than I 

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:27.030

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:30.150
 forever 

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:31.770
 Then he said something else too. 

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:33.180
 I can do for you in a matter of 

00:02:31.770 --> 00:02:34.320
 The staples issue is one of the 

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:36.120
 good thing too 

00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:38.790
 from what I saw in the ward for what they 

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:42.150
 they promised they fulfilled the graphics 

00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:44.040
 so beautiful the scenery the environment and 

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:46.290
 Inclusion, it's beautiful, you know. 

00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:48.090
 the birds to fiddle with the chief of the 

00:02:46.290 --> 00:02:50.790
 character in the shadow of the character is 

00:02:48.090 --> 00:02:51.750
 beautiful also several things so beautiful 

00:02:50.790 --> 00:02:53.760
 in the game 

00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:55.290
 the animation of the character the soundtrack 

00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:58.140
 three years ago 

00:02:55.290 --> 00:03:00.020
 the soundtrack people are very fucking 

00:02:58.140 --> 00:03:03.510
 Why are you playing like this, the song is? 

00:03:00.020 --> 00:03:05.520
 both 'tifosi' scared nothing you kind 

00:03:03.510 --> 00:03:07.709
 that even the producers did not tell you will 

00:03:05.520 --> 00:03:10.020
 feel totally in the middle of a 

00:03:07.709 --> 00:03:12.600
 zombie apocalypse so he is he they 

00:03:10.020 --> 00:03:14.640
 fulfilled they bring brought to the game 

00:03:12.600 --> 00:03:16.200
 then disney fucking very positive point 

00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:18.030
 It is very cool even if you are not a 

00:03:16.200 --> 00:03:19.590
 end does not like to hear the sound of the game 

00:03:18.030 --> 00:03:21.959
 recommends you start listening now 

00:03:19.590 --> 00:03:23.610
 because they know that they interact more with the 

00:03:21.959 --> 00:03:26.400
 game to pack plus the game is very 

00:03:23.610 --> 00:03:29.010
 fuck really and question of shot in question 

00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:30.690
 How do you pvp players 

00:03:29.010 --> 00:03:33.450
 I think the vote en because so far 

00:03:30.690 --> 00:03:36.900
 I think it was USB yesterday and it was 

00:03:33.450 --> 00:03:39.840
 playing a sbd usb flame that i got 

00:03:36.900 --> 00:03:42.239
 I killed two players hit the mountain 

00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:44.280
 running lethal from a shot only fell him 

00:03:42.239 --> 00:03:46.620
 another one a close up was carving 

00:03:44.280 --> 00:03:49.260
 and then I was on the slab and such 

00:03:46.620 --> 00:03:51.480
 I was invading a building alone there 

00:03:49.260 --> 00:03:53.489
 Dude, you said it in a friendly chat. 

00:03:51.480 --> 00:03:55.650
 I was in the city there and I thought 

00:03:53.489 --> 00:03:57.060
 It was not the same city ​​I was there. 

00:03:55.650 --> 00:03:59.130
 after a friend of mine explained to me that 

00:03:57.060 --> 00:04:01.680
 when the guy writes and they appear in 

00:03:59.130 --> 00:04:02.550
 Green the promised think it's near 

00:04:01.680 --> 00:04:03.900
 he 

00:04:02.550 --> 00:04:06.239
 He's because he 's ready so I went 

00:04:03.900 --> 00:04:08.610
 there good not care about that then giving 

00:04:06.239 --> 00:04:11.010
 so the son of coast on the guitar father in the 

00:04:08.610 --> 00:04:12.239
 my face there I fell to the ground it was crap 

00:04:11.010 --> 00:04:13.470
 old man I died mann 

00:04:12.239 --> 00:04:15.209
 so that guy who wrote was 

00:04:13.470 --> 00:04:16.620
 next to me and asked if it was 

00:04:15.209 --> 00:04:18.570
 and I did not answer anything, the guy killed me 

00:04:16.620 --> 00:04:20.609
 so it was my mistake but the question of 

00:04:18.570 --> 00:04:23.430
 pvp galheta really fuck I already killed 

00:04:20.609 --> 00:04:25.289
 two players in the flashlight as it was already 

00:04:23.430 --> 00:04:27.480
 two players in this bbb11 was that 

00:04:25.289 --> 00:04:30.540
 sculpted and the ips face of 

00:04:27.480 --> 00:04:32.100
 of 12 in the face and zombie buzzing issues 

00:04:30.540 --> 00:04:33.840
 He is with a broken truck still 

00:04:32.100 --> 00:04:36.300
 has a team standing still can not 

00:04:33.840 --> 00:04:38.490
 run on zombie that debate you get 

00:04:36.300 --> 00:04:40.080
 kill him but it's buggy thing even more 

00:04:38.490 --> 00:04:41.970
 The sumbe tap question is very fucking 

00:04:40.080 --> 00:04:44.010
 same is the customization it is with 

00:04:41.970 --> 00:04:45.930
 zombie way , it's even better that he gave it 

00:04:44.010 --> 00:04:47.700
 here the guardian is better than the 

00:04:45.930 --> 00:04:50.580
 Kiss in my opinion I think it is 

00:04:47.700 --> 00:04:52.350
 It's because dance 's best is soldiers and it's 

00:04:50.580 --> 00:04:53.730
 something that in a business that is 

00:04:52.350 --> 00:04:56.190
 upload same year gave everything 

00:04:53.730 --> 00:04:58.980
 tabulated is ripped all food in 

00:04:56.190 --> 00:05:00.300
 event was a very positive point right 

00:04:58.980 --> 00:05:01.740
 I think I said too much in this video. 

00:05:00.300 --> 00:05:03.540
 On returning I will leave the staff at 

00:05:01.740 --> 00:05:05.850
 next frame in next block channel 

00:05:03.540 --> 00:05:07.410
 That's a good video for you. 

00:05:05.850 --> 00:05:09.330
 football so I can make a list and 

00:05:07.410 --> 00:05:10.980
 Talking to you, talking to you. 

00:05:09.330 --> 00:05:12.480
 explaining more about the game worth the 

00:05:10.980 --> 00:05:13.890
 Worth not buying for those who are not 

00:05:12.480 --> 00:05:15.810

00:05:13.890 --> 00:05:19.290

00:05:45.900 --> 00:05:50.250
