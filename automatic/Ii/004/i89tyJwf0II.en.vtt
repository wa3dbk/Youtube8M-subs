00:00:00.650 --> 00:00:05.990
 the peanut is a good food for the 

00:00:03.110 --> 00:00:08.540
 diabetes can lower your risk of 

00:00:05.990 --> 00:00:10.639
 develop type 2 diabetes helps you 

00:00:08.540 --> 00:00:12.799
 control blood glucose and even to 

00:00:10.639 --> 00:00:15.199
 reduce the risk of other problems 

00:00:12.799 --> 00:00:18.199
 that often accompany cardiovascular 

00:00:15.199 --> 00:00:20.660
 this disease is about a food 

00:00:18.199 --> 00:00:24.410
 of low glycemic index rich in 

00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:27.140
 protein fiber and healthy fats the 

00:00:24.410 --> 00:00:29.089
 Peanuts are a good source of fiber 

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:32.329
 agreement with the American association 

00:00:29.089 --> 00:00:35.330
 of diabetes most adults 

00:00:32.329 --> 00:00:37.820
 should try to get between 25 and 30 

00:00:35.330 --> 00:00:40.040
 grams of fiber a day a fiber 

00:00:37.820 --> 00:00:42.410
 Adequate dietetics can also offer 

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:45.260
 to diabetics a control of sugar 

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:47.840
 in blood this fiber reduces absorption 

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:50.360
 intestinal of dietary sugars 

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:52.520
 this can help control the 

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:54.980
 blood sugar levels since 

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:56.930
 means a lower peak of glucose in 

00:00:54.980 --> 00:00:59.780
 blood and a slower increase and 

00:00:56.930 --> 00:01:01.910
 controlled the consumption of 

00:00:59.780 --> 00:01:04.400
 Peanut is associated with a lower risk of 

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:07.100
 develop diabetes according to a study 

00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:10.220
 recently published in the newspaper of the 

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:12.830
 Medical Association of the USA in 2002 

00:01:10.220 --> 00:01:17.180
 the researchers took a sample 

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:19.460
 of 83 thousand 818 women from the study of 

00:01:17.180 --> 00:01:22.189
 health of nurses covering 11 

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:24.920
 different states all women 

00:01:22.189 --> 00:01:27.399
 they were healthy without a history of diabetes 

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:31.009
 cancer or cardiovascular diseases 

00:01:27.399 --> 00:01:33.320
 they were controlled for 16 

00:01:31.009 --> 00:01:35.990
 years and tracked the consumption of peanuts and 

00:01:33.320 --> 00:01:38.090
 the incidence of diabetes at the end 

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:40.550
 of the study the researchers 

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:42.800
 concluded that the consumption of peanuts can 

00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:46.009
 potentially reduce the risk of 

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:48.409
 develop diabetes however given 

00:01:46.009 --> 00:01:51.020
 they are high in calories the peanuts 

00:01:48.409 --> 00:01:53.300
 they should be consumed as a substitute for 

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:56.860
 other protein sources raised in 

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:56.860
 fats like meat
