00:01:04.240 --> 00:01:04.250 
it changes things it makes it a more

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:07.060 
it changes things it makes it a more
dynamic<00:01:04.460> space<00:01:05.089> one<00:01:06.080> where<00:01:06.320> people<00:01:06.710> feel<00:01:07.009> free

00:01:07.060 --> 00:01:07.070 
dynamic space one where people feel free

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:09.340 
dynamic space one where people feel free
to<00:01:07.640> come<00:01:07.820> into<00:01:08.000> work<00:01:08.299> and<00:01:08.630> share<00:01:08.869> what's<00:01:09.110> going

00:01:09.340 --> 00:01:09.350 
to come into work and share what's going

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:11.560 
to come into work and share what's going
on<00:01:09.500> in<00:01:09.649> their<00:01:09.800> lives<00:01:10.009> how<00:01:10.940> they're<00:01:11.179> giving

00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:11.570 
on in their lives how they're giving

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:15.100 
on in their lives how they're giving
back<00:01:12.220> and<00:01:13.220> I<00:01:13.340> think<00:01:13.369> it<00:01:13.670> also<00:01:13.899> lets<00:01:14.899> people

00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:15.110

day and it just makes such a big
difference<00:01:39.319> and<00:01:40.039> then<00:01:40.490> you<00:01:40.700> have<00:01:40.910> a<00:01:40.940> bond

00:01:41.260 --> 00:01:41.270 
difference and then you have a bond

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:45.279 
difference and then you have a bond
outside<00:01:41.989> the<00:01:42.170> hotel<00:01:42.380> which<00:01:43.099> creates<00:01:44.289> loyalty

different departments giving us to bond
together<00:01:54.410> especially<00:01:55.039> because<00:01:55.489> we<00:01:55.670> usually

00:01:55.839 --> 00:01:55.849 
together especially because we usually

00:01:55.849 --> 00:01:57.699 
together especially because we usually
