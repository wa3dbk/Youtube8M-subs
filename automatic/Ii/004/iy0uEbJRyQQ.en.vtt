um that's the way I wall should be you
know<00:02:50.459> make<00:02:51.030> it<00:02:51.120> nice<00:02:51.269> and<00:02:51.299> tall<00:02:51.769> give<00:02:52.769> the<00:02:52.890> guy

know make it nice and tall give the guy
some<00:02:53.010> room<00:02:53.430> so<00:02:54.269> he<00:02:54.329> doesn't<00:02:54.480> have<00:02:54.599> to<00:02:54.690> worry

00:02:54.890 --> 00:02:54.900 
some room so he doesn't have to worry

00:02:54.900 --> 00:02:58.280 
some room so he doesn't have to worry
about<00:02:55.019> it<00:02:56.510> you<00:02:57.510> know<00:02:57.540> if<00:02:57.780> you're<00:02:57.930> behind<00:02:58.049> it

00:02:58.280 --> 00:02:58.290 
about it you know if you're behind it

00:02:58.290 --> 00:03:00.949 
about it you know if you're behind it
you<00:02:58.319> got<00:02:58.530> your<00:02:58.650> cover<00:02:58.799> safe<00:02:59.450> and<00:03:00.450> just<00:03:00.750> to<00:03:00.840> give

00:03:00.949 --> 00:03:00.959 
you got your cover safe and just to give

00:03:00.959 --> 00:03:03.339 
you got your cover safe and just to give
you<00:03:01.019> an<00:03:01.109> idea<00:03:01.170> of<00:03:01.440> how<00:03:01.560> tall<00:03:01.829> it<00:03:02.010> is<00:03:02.129> by<00:03:02.549> itself

00:03:03.339 --> 00:03:03.349 
you an idea of how tall it is by itself

00:03:03.349 --> 00:03:06.229 
you an idea of how tall it is by itself
and<00:03:04.349> once<00:03:04.530> again<00:03:04.650> another<00:03:05.609> one<00:03:05.730> snow<00:03:06.060> around

00:03:06.229 --> 00:03:06.239 
and once again another one snow around

00:03:06.239 --> 00:03:07.460 
and once again another one snow around
the<00:03:06.390> base<00:03:06.510> I've<00:03:06.720> got<00:03:06.840> a<00:03:06.870> little<00:03:07.049> bit<00:03:07.260> of<00:03:07.349> snow

00:03:07.460 --> 00:03:07.470 
the base I've got a little bit of snow

00:03:07.470 --> 00:03:11.870 
the base I've got a little bit of snow
actually<00:03:08.069> going<00:03:08.220> up<00:03:08.970> the<00:03:09.239> wall<00:03:10.609> spin<00:03:11.609> this<00:03:11.730> one

00:03:11.870 --> 00:03:11.880 
actually going up the wall spin this one

00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:12.979 
actually going up the wall spin this one
around<00:03:12.090> so<00:03:12.209> you<00:03:12.269> can<00:03:12.329> see<00:03:12.420> the<00:03:12.569> other<00:03:12.690> side<00:03:12.780> of

00:03:12.979 --> 00:03:12.989 
around so you can see the other side of

00:03:12.989 --> 00:03:15.650 
around so you can see the other side of
it<00:03:13.230> and<00:03:14.130> a<00:03:14.609> lot<00:03:14.790> of<00:03:14.849> snow<00:03:15.120> actually<00:03:15.480> right<00:03:15.630> in

00:03:15.650 --> 00:03:15.660 
it and a lot of snow actually right in

00:03:15.660 --> 00:03:16.970 
it and a lot of snow actually right in
here<00:03:16.049> because<00:03:16.319> that<00:03:16.470> would<00:03:16.590> be<00:03:16.709> where<00:03:16.859> it

00:03:16.970 --> 00:03:16.980 
here because that would be where it

00:03:16.980 --> 00:03:18.650 
here because that would be where it
would<00:03:17.069> normally<00:03:17.549> collect<00:03:18.090> if<00:03:18.239> you<00:03:18.329> had<00:03:18.420> wind

00:03:18.650 --> 00:03:18.660 
would normally collect if you had wind

00:03:18.660 --> 00:03:23.690 
would normally collect if you had wind
blowing<00:03:19.160> so<00:03:20.160> you<00:03:20.250> can<00:03:20.459> see<00:03:22.069> our<00:03:23.069> broad<00:03:23.310> side<00:03:23.519> is

00:03:23.690 --> 00:03:23.700 
blowing so you can see our broad side is

00:03:23.700 --> 00:03:25.940 
blowing so you can see our broad side is
pretty<00:03:24.389> well<00:03:24.540> shielded<00:03:24.870> if<00:03:25.169> we<00:03:25.319> stick<00:03:25.919> with

00:03:25.940 --> 00:03:25.950 
pretty well shielded if we stick with

00:03:25.950 --> 00:03:32.720 
pretty well shielded if we stick with
that<00:03:26.160> wall<00:03:27.319> and<00:03:29.480> just<00:03:30.480> one<00:03:30.870> more<00:03:31.459> to<00:03:32.459> make<00:03:32.519> sure

00:03:32.720 --> 00:03:32.730 
that wall and just one more to make sure

00:03:32.730 --> 00:03:33.979 
that wall and just one more to make sure
that<00:03:32.880> we<00:03:32.940> have<00:03:33.060> enough<00:03:33.090> balls<00:03:33.510> because<00:03:33.870> you

00:03:33.979 --> 00:03:33.989 
that we have enough balls because you

00:03:33.989 --> 00:03:38.870 
that we have enough balls because you
can<00:03:35.060> never<00:03:36.060> really<00:03:36.299> have<00:03:36.599> too<00:03:37.139> many<00:03:37.760> we've<00:03:38.760> got

00:03:38.870 --> 00:03:38.880 
can never really have too many we've got

00:03:38.880 --> 00:03:42.440 
can never really have too many we've got
this<00:03:39.060> guy<00:03:39.269> now<00:03:40.139> this<00:03:40.380> is<00:03:40.620> one<00:03:40.980> long<00:03:41.010> wall<00:03:41.849> in

00:03:42.440 --> 00:03:42.450 
this guy now this is one long wall in

00:03:42.450 --> 00:03:44.390 
this guy now this is one long wall in
fact<00:03:42.780> it's<00:03:42.989> a<00:03:43.200> little<00:03:43.530> bit<00:03:43.650> too<00:03:44.010> big<00:03:44.160> to<00:03:44.310> even

00:03:44.390 --> 00:03:44.400 
fact it's a little bit too big to even

00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:51.140 
fact it's a little bit too big to even
fit<00:03:45.440> inside<00:03:46.440> my<00:03:46.799> booth<00:03:49.639> so<00:03:50.639> you<00:03:50.700> can<00:03:50.849> see<00:03:51.000> from

00:03:51.140 --> 00:03:51.150 
fit inside my booth so you can see from

00:03:51.150 --> 00:03:53.920 
fit inside my booth so you can see from
one<00:03:51.389> end<00:03:51.739> all<00:03:52.739> the<00:03:53.010> way<00:03:53.099> down<00:03:53.250> to<00:03:53.370> the<00:03:53.459> other

00:03:53.920 --> 00:03:53.930 
one end all the way down to the other

00:03:53.930 --> 00:03:58.069 
one end all the way down to the other
once<00:03:54.930> again<00:03:55.340> if<00:03:56.340> you<00:03:56.430> put<00:03:56.609> your<00:03:56.870> fire<00:03:57.870> were

00:03:58.069 --> 00:03:58.079 
once again if you put your fire were

00:03:58.079 --> 00:04:00.800 
once again if you put your fire were
behind<00:03:58.440> it<00:03:59.180> he's<00:04:00.180> going<00:04:00.329> to<00:04:00.389> get<00:04:00.510> this<00:04:00.599> cover

00:04:00.800 --> 00:04:00.810 
behind it he's going to get this cover

00:04:00.810 --> 00:04:04.629 
behind it he's going to get this cover
safe<00:04:01.079> and<00:04:01.380> it's<00:04:02.280> actually<00:04:02.400> wide<00:04:02.819> enough<00:04:03.150> that

00:04:04.629 --> 00:04:04.639 
safe and it's actually wide enough that

00:04:04.639 --> 00:04:07.369 
safe and it's actually wide enough that
if<00:04:05.639> I<00:04:05.730> really<00:04:05.970> wanted<00:04:06.329> to<00:04:06.389> if<00:04:06.750> someone<00:04:07.290> was

00:04:07.369 --> 00:04:07.379 
if I really wanted to if someone was

00:04:07.379 --> 00:04:09.530 
if I really wanted to if someone was
suicidal<00:04:07.950> enough<00:04:08.220> to<00:04:08.790> stand<00:04:09.000> on<00:04:09.180> top<00:04:09.209> of<00:04:09.480> the

00:04:09.530 --> 00:04:09.540 
suicidal enough to stand on top of the

00:04:09.540 --> 00:04:13.430 
suicidal enough to stand on top of the
wall<00:04:09.690> I<00:04:10.609> mean<00:04:11.609> yes<00:04:11.819> that's<00:04:12.090> instant<00:04:12.989> death<00:04:13.200> if

00:04:13.430 --> 00:04:13.440 
wall I mean yes that's instant death if

00:04:13.440 --> 00:04:16.520 
wall I mean yes that's instant death if
you<00:04:13.530> do<00:04:13.709> it<00:04:13.859> but<00:04:14.160> they<00:04:14.989> are<00:04:15.989> wide<00:04:16.199> enough<00:04:16.350> you

00:04:16.520 --> 00:04:16.530 
you do it but they are wide enough you

00:04:16.530 --> 00:04:18.560 
you do it but they are wide enough you
could<00:04:16.650> actually<00:04:16.769> put<00:04:17.070> you<00:04:17.340> can<00:04:18.180> actually<00:04:18.299> put

00:04:18.560 --> 00:04:18.570 
could actually put you can actually put

00:04:18.570 --> 00:04:19.750 
could actually put you can actually put
figs<00:04:18.780> on<00:04:18.930> top<00:04:19.079> of<00:04:19.229> them

00:04:19.750 --> 00:04:19.760
