00:03:26.230 --> 00:03:26.240 
the same time so we were experiencing

00:03:26.240 --> 00:03:27.490

00:03:27.490 --> 00:03:27.500 
the same thing at the same time and I

00:03:27.500 --> 00:03:29.410 
the same thing at the same time and I
think<00:03:27.530> that<00:03:27.710> worked<00:03:28.010> out<00:03:28.130> well<00:03:28.340> the<00:03:29.270> other

00:03:29.410 --> 00:03:29.420 
think that worked out well the other

00:03:29.420 --> 00:03:30.940 
think that worked out well the other
thing<00:03:29.570> I<00:03:29.690> didn't<00:03:29.930> really<00:03:30.110> understand<00:03:30.560> going

00:03:30.940 --> 00:03:30.950 
thing I didn't really understand going

00:03:30.950 --> 00:03:34.390 
thing I didn't really understand going
into<00:03:31.160> it<00:03:31.280> was<00:03:31.370> how<00:03:31.520> long<00:03:32.410> these<00:03:33.410> missions<00:03:34.100> are

00:03:34.390 --> 00:03:34.400 
into it was how long these missions are

00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:36.880 
into it was how long these missions are
like<00:03:34.820> they're<00:03:35.060> extreme<00:03:36.020> they<00:03:36.260> take<00:03:36.440> a<00:03:36.470> lot<00:03:36.860> of

00:03:36.880 --> 00:03:36.890 
like they're extreme they take a lot of

00:03:36.890 --> 00:03:39.490 
like they're extreme they take a lot of
time<00:03:37.190> because<00:03:37.670> there's<00:03:37.880> prep<00:03:38.720> work<00:03:38.990> that<00:03:39.230> has

00:03:39.490 --> 00:03:39.500 
time because there's prep work that has

00:03:39.500 --> 00:03:41.680 
time because there's prep work that has
to<00:03:39.650> be<00:03:39.680> done<00:03:39.950> on<00:03:40.130> the<00:03:40.250> heist<00:03:40.430> like<00:03:40.760> multiple

heist<00:03:43.670> and<00:03:43.880> then<00:03:44.030> you<00:03:44.120> have<00:03:44.210> to<00:03:44.330> do<00:03:44.450> the<00:03:44.540> actual

00:03:44.740 --> 00:03:44.750

00:03:44.750 --> 00:03:47.680 
heist and then you have to do the actual
heist<00:03:44.990> and<00:03:45.260> every<00:03:46.130> step<00:03:46.640> of<00:03:46.730> the<00:03:46.820> way<00:03:46.850> is<00:03:47.270> kind

00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:47.690 
heist and every step of the way is kind

00:03:47.690 --> 00:03:50.500 
heist and every step of the way is kind
of<00:03:47.780> long<00:03:48.140> in<00:03:48.470> fact<00:03:48.740> we<00:03:49.580> recorded<00:03:50.150> the<00:03:50.480> first

00:03:50.500 --> 00:03:50.510 
of long in fact we recorded the first

00:03:50.510 --> 00:03:52.870 
of long in fact we recorded the first
heist<00:03:51.170> the<00:03:51.770> two<00:03:51.920> player<00:03:52.100> heist<00:03:52.370> which<00:03:52.550> is<00:03:52.700> like

00:03:52.870 --> 00:03:52.880 
heist the two player heist which is like

00:03:52.880 --> 00:03:55.300 
heist the two player heist which is like
it's<00:03:53.300> kind<00:03:53.570> of<00:03:53.600> like<00:03:53.750> a<00:03:53.780> training<00:03:54.200> heist<00:03:54.860> in<00:03:55.190> a

00:03:55.300 --> 00:03:55.310 
it's kind of like a training heist in a

00:03:55.310 --> 00:03:57.730 
it's kind of like a training heist in a
way<00:03:55.460> and<00:03:55.730> then<00:03:56.120> we<00:03:56.210> did<00:03:56.360> one<00:03:56.660> the<00:03:57.320> next<00:03:57.590> one

00:03:57.730 --> 00:03:57.740 
way and then we did one the next one

00:03:57.740 --> 00:03:59.170 
way and then we did one the next one
which<00:03:57.920> was<00:03:58.070> the<00:03:58.250> prison<00:03:58.550> break<00:03:58.670> which<00:03:59.000> is<00:03:59.030> a

which was the prison break which is a
four-player<00:04:00.020> one<00:04:00.260> and<00:04:01.540> just<00:04:02.540> doing<00:04:02.840> those<00:04:03.020> two

00:04:03.310 --> 00:04:03.320 
four-player one and just doing those two

00:04:03.320 --> 00:04:06.340 
four-player one and just doing those two
we<00:04:03.950> recorded<00:04:04.400> for<00:04:04.580> five<00:04:04.760> hours<00:04:04.790> five<00:04:05.750> hours

00:04:06.340 --> 00:04:06.350 
we recorded for five hours five hours

00:04:06.350 --> 00:04:08.860 
we recorded for five hours five hours
that<00:04:06.950> is<00:04:07.130> a<00:04:07.160> lot<00:04:07.550> of<00:04:07.790> footage<00:04:08.090> and<00:04:08.210> as<00:04:08.660> of<00:04:08.840> right

00:04:08.860 --> 00:04:08.870 
that is a lot of footage and as of right

00:04:08.870 --> 00:04:11.530 
that is a lot of footage and as of right
now<00:04:09.140> I'm<00:04:09.410> not<00:04:09.440> entirely<00:04:10.010> certain<00:04:10.460> how<00:04:10.880> I'm

00:04:11.530 --> 00:04:11.540 
now I'm not entirely certain how I'm

00:04:11.540 --> 00:04:13.690 
now I'm not entirely certain how I'm
gonna<00:04:11.720> cut<00:04:11.930> this<00:04:12.080> down<00:04:12.320> like<00:04:12.770> I<00:04:13.010> thought<00:04:13.550> it

00:04:13.690 --> 00:04:13.700 
gonna cut this down like I thought it

00:04:13.700 --> 00:04:15.730 
gonna cut this down like I thought it
would<00:04:13.820> just<00:04:13.850> be<00:04:14.030> you<00:04:14.630> know<00:04:14.750> each<00:04:14.990> heist<00:04:15.230> is<00:04:15.530> its

00:04:15.730 --> 00:04:15.740 
would just be you know each heist is its

00:04:15.740 --> 00:04:18.789 
would just be you know each heist is its
own<00:04:15.860> video<00:04:16.400> and<00:04:16.760> now<00:04:16.970> I'm<00:04:17.239> like<00:04:17.480> me<00:04:18.260> that<00:04:18.560> heist

00:04:18.789 --> 00:04:18.799 
own video and now I'm like me that heist

00:04:18.799 --> 00:04:20.830 
own video and now I'm like me that heist
might<00:04:19.010> be<00:04:19.160> two<00:04:19.340> videos<00:04:19.700> it<00:04:20.180> might<00:04:20.330> have<00:04:20.540> to<00:04:20.720> be

00:04:20.830 --> 00:04:20.840 
might be two videos it might have to be

00:04:20.840 --> 00:04:22.110 
might be two videos it might have to be
because<00:04:21.170> it's<00:04:21.320> just<00:04:21.530> gonna<00:04:21.620> be<00:04:21.739> too<00:04:21.859> much

00:04:22.110 --> 00:04:22.120 
because it's just gonna be too much

00:04:22.120 --> 00:04:24.520 
because it's just gonna be too much
unless<00:04:23.120> I<00:04:23.270> really<00:04:23.510> really<00:04:24.020> really<00:04:24.290> cut<00:04:24.440> it

00:04:24.520 --> 00:04:24.530 
unless I really really really cut it

00:04:24.530 --> 00:04:27.280 
unless I really really really cut it
down<00:04:24.650> and<00:04:24.980> I<00:04:25.940> don't<00:04:26.180> know<00:04:26.720> if<00:04:26.840> I<00:04:26.900> can<00:04:26.960> get<00:04:27.200> it

00:04:27.280 --> 00:04:27.290 
down and I don't know if I can get it

00:04:27.290 --> 00:04:29.080 
down and I don't know if I can get it
down<00:04:27.380> that<00:04:27.620> much<00:04:27.680> we'll<00:04:28.370> see<00:04:28.400> what<00:04:28.730> happens

00:04:29.080 --> 00:04:29.090 
down that much we'll see what happens

00:04:29.090 --> 00:04:31.870 
down that much we'll see what happens
but<00:04:29.360> I'm<00:04:29.630> not<00:04:30.070> I'm<00:04:31.070> not<00:04:31.460> a<00:04:31.490> hundred<00:04:31.730> percent

00:04:31.870 --> 00:04:31.880 
but I'm not I'm not a hundred percent

00:04:31.880 --> 00:04:33.820 
but I'm not I'm not a hundred percent
certain<00:04:32.300> the<00:04:32.990> other<00:04:33.110> thing<00:04:33.350> is<00:04:33.500> even<00:04:33.680> though

00:04:33.820 --> 00:04:33.830 
certain the other thing is even though

00:04:33.830 --> 00:04:35.650 
certain the other thing is even though
Heights<00:04:34.040> are<00:04:34.160> extremely<00:04:34.550> fun<00:04:34.850> they<00:04:35.240> are<00:04:35.419> very

00:04:35.650 --> 00:04:35.660 
Heights are extremely fun they are very

Heights are extremely fun they are very
fun<00:04:35.930> and<00:04:36.169> the<00:04:37.070> cool<00:04:37.250> one<00:04:37.430> of<00:04:37.520> the<00:04:37.580> cool<00:04:37.730> things

00:04:37.870 --> 00:04:37.880 
fun and the cool one of the cool things

00:04:37.880 --> 00:04:39.190 
fun and the cool one of the cool things
about<00:04:37.970> heist<00:04:38.270> is<00:04:38.390> that<00:04:38.540> there's<00:04:38.720> different

00:04:39.190 --> 00:04:39.200 
about heist is that there's different

00:04:39.200 --> 00:04:42.909 
about heist is that there's different
positions<00:04:39.830> to<00:04:40.220> be<00:04:40.250> in<00:04:40.840> and<00:04:41.840> if<00:04:42.560> you're<00:04:42.710> on<00:04:42.830> the

00:04:42.909 --> 00:04:42.919 
positions to be in and if you're on the

00:04:42.919 --> 00:04:44.200 
positions to be in and if you're on the
diff<00:04:43.070> you're<00:04:43.370> in<00:04:43.490> a<00:04:43.550> different<00:04:43.820> position<00:04:43.940> you

00:04:44.200 --> 00:04:44.210 
diff you're in a different position you

00:04:44.210 --> 00:04:45.610 
diff you're in a different position you
may<00:04:44.330> see<00:04:44.390> a<00:04:44.510> completely<00:04:44.870> different<00:04:44.990> side<00:04:45.350> of

00:04:45.610 --> 00:04:45.620 
may see a completely different side of

00:04:45.620 --> 00:04:48.940 
may see a completely different side of
the<00:04:45.830> the<00:04:46.669> stuff<00:04:46.970> the<00:04:47.330> heist<00:04:47.510> I<00:04:47.840> don't<00:04:48.710> know<00:04:48.830> if

00:04:48.940 --> 00:04:48.950 
the the stuff the heist I don't know if

00:04:48.950 --> 00:04:50.980 
the the stuff the heist I don't know if
I'm<00:04:49.010> gonna<00:04:49.130> replay<00:04:49.580> through<00:04:50.060> them<00:04:50.270> my<00:04:50.419> plan

00:04:50.980 --> 00:04:50.990 
I'm gonna replay through them my plan

00:04:50.990 --> 00:04:55.030 
I'm gonna replay through them my plan
was<00:04:51.290> originally<00:04:51.910> to<00:04:53.110> you<00:04:54.110> know<00:04:54.230> go<00:04:55.010> through

00:04:55.030 --> 00:04:55.040 
was originally to you know go through

00:04:55.040 --> 00:04:58.870 
was originally to you know go through
the<00:04:55.970> missions<00:04:56.360> with<00:04:56.750> like<00:04:57.160> this<00:04:58.160> group<00:04:58.460> Alex

00:04:58.870 --> 00:04:58.880 
the missions with like this group Alex

00:04:58.880 --> 00:05:00.940 
the missions with like this group Alex
Dane<00:04:59.090> and<00:04:59.270> Taylor<00:04:59.570> and<00:04:59.690> then<00:05:00.200> go<00:05:00.500> through<00:05:00.770> them

00:05:00.940 --> 00:05:00.950 
Dane and Taylor and then go through them

00:05:00.950 --> 00:05:03.159 
Dane and Taylor and then go through them
again<00:05:01.070> with<00:05:01.580> like<00:05:01.790> a<00:05:01.820> different<00:05:02.330> group<00:05:02.570> but<00:05:03.080> to

00:05:03.159 --> 00:05:03.169 
again with like a different group but to

00:05:03.169 --> 00:05:04.990 
again with like a different group but to
be<00:05:03.230> honest<00:05:03.530> I<00:05:03.620> don't<00:05:03.950> actually<00:05:04.250> like<00:05:04.850> they're

00:05:04.990 --> 00:05:05.000 
be honest I don't actually like they're

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:06.550 
be honest I don't actually like they're
interesting<00:05:05.570> but<00:05:05.750> I<00:05:05.840> don't<00:05:06.080> think<00:05:06.230> they<00:05:06.380> would

00:05:06.550 --> 00:05:06.560 
interesting but I don't think they would

00:05:06.560 --> 00:05:08.770 
interesting but I don't think they would
be<00:05:06.590> interesting<00:05:07.280> enough<00:05:07.370> to<00:05:07.610> see<00:05:07.880> twice<00:05:08.390> even

00:05:08.770 --> 00:05:08.780 
be interesting enough to see twice even

00:05:08.780 --> 00:05:10.720 
be interesting enough to see twice even
if<00:05:09.140> it<00:05:09.230> was<00:05:09.380> from<00:05:09.620> a<00:05:09.680> different<00:05:09.770> perspective<00:05:10.190> I

00:05:10.720 --> 00:05:10.730 
if it was from a different perspective I

00:05:10.730 --> 00:05:12.460 
if it was from a different perspective I
think<00:05:11.120> there's<00:05:11.270> too<00:05:11.480> much<00:05:11.630> that's<00:05:11.930> similar

00:05:12.460 --> 00:05:12.470 
think there's too much that's similar

00:05:12.470 --> 00:05:18.120 
think there's too much that's similar
that<00:05:13.280> it<00:05:13.880> won't<00:05:14.600> be<00:05:14.930> worth<00:05:15.940> watching<00:05:16.940> maybe

00:05:18.120 --> 00:05:18.130 
that it won't be worth watching maybe

00:05:18.130 --> 00:05:20.500 
that it won't be worth watching maybe
that's<00:05:19.130> not<00:05:19.280> to<00:05:19.430> say<00:05:19.580> GTA<00:05:19.910> online<00:05:20.090> would<00:05:20.390> be

00:05:20.500 --> 00:05:20.510 
that's not to say GTA online would be

00:05:20.510 --> 00:05:22.390 
that's not to say GTA online would be
done<00:05:20.690> it's<00:05:20.990> just<00:05:21.080> that<00:05:21.440> we<00:05:21.650> may<00:05:21.830> do<00:05:22.010> these<00:05:22.190> five

00:05:22.390 --> 00:05:22.400 
done it's just that we may do these five

00:05:22.400 --> 00:05:24.550 
done it's just that we may do these five
heists<00:05:22.790> with<00:05:23.030> Alex<00:05:23.390> Dane<00:05:23.570> and<00:05:23.750> Taylor<00:05:24.050> which

00:05:24.550 --> 00:05:24.560 
heists with Alex Dane and Taylor which

00:05:24.560 --> 00:05:26.409 
heists with Alex Dane and Taylor which
is<00:05:24.710> a<00:05:24.740> really<00:05:25.130> great<00:05:25.250> group<00:05:25.550> because<00:05:25.910> we<00:05:26.180> get

00:05:26.409 --> 00:05:26.419 
is a really great group because we get

slightly<00:07:44.520> easier<00:07:44.970> unless<00:07:45.240> it's<00:07:45.540> just<00:07:45.810> the<00:07:46.080> two

00:07:46.220 --> 00:07:46.230 
slightly easier unless it's just the two
