hi<00:00:10.040> I'm<00:00:10.310> Matt<00:00:10.520> Gallaher<00:00:10.940> and<00:00:11.090> we're<00:00:11.270> looking

00:00:11.590 --> 00:00:11.600 
hi I'm Matt Gallaher and we're looking

00:00:11.600 --> 00:00:14.860 
hi I'm Matt Gallaher and we're looking
at<00:00:11.720> the<00:00:11.840> new<00:00:11.990> Canon<00:00:12.410> EOS<00:00:12.710> 7d<00:00:13.250> camera<00:00:13.910> now<00:00:14.570> this

00:00:14.860 --> 00:00:14.870 
at the new Canon EOS 7d camera now this

00:00:14.870 --> 00:00:17.320 
at the new Canon EOS 7d camera now this
is<00:00:15.020> the<00:00:15.140> latest<00:00:15.410> digital<00:00:15.890> SLR<00:00:16.430> from<00:00:16.790> Canon<00:00:17.240> and

00:00:17.320 --> 00:00:17.330 
is the latest digital SLR from Canon and

00:00:17.330 --> 00:00:19.750 
is the latest digital SLR from Canon and
it's<00:00:18.170> actually<00:00:18.560> been<00:00:18.740> built<00:00:19.070> from<00:00:19.369> the<00:00:19.520> ground

00:00:19.750 --> 00:00:19.760 
it's actually been built from the ground

00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:22.600 
it's actually been built from the ground
up<00:00:19.970> with<00:00:20.600> lots<00:00:20.990> of<00:00:21.140> feedback<00:00:21.320> from<00:00:21.890> existing

00:00:22.600 --> 00:00:22.610 
up with lots of feedback from existing

00:00:22.610 --> 00:00:24.850 
up with lots of feedback from existing
Canon<00:00:22.880> users<00:00:23.270> to<00:00:23.779> actually<00:00:24.020> make<00:00:24.170> it<00:00:24.350> as<00:00:24.529> good

00:00:24.850 --> 00:00:24.860 
Canon users to actually make it as good

00:00:24.860 --> 00:00:27.220 
Canon users to actually make it as good
as<00:00:25.010> possible<00:00:25.189> and<00:00:25.640> make<00:00:25.970> the<00:00:26.119> handling<00:00:26.509> really

00:00:27.220 --> 00:00:27.230 
as possible and make the handling really

00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:30.700 
as possible and make the handling really
respond<00:00:28.070> for<00:00:28.310> the<00:00:28.369> users<00:00:28.759> so<00:00:28.970> this<00:00:29.900> is<00:00:30.079> a<00:00:30.290> lot

00:00:30.700 --> 00:00:30.710 
respond for the users so this is a lot

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:33.250 
respond for the users so this is a lot
of<00:00:30.800> changes<00:00:31.220> from<00:00:31.340> previous<00:00:31.579> models<00:00:32.000> so<00:00:32.900> let's

00:00:33.250 --> 00:00:33.260 
of changes from previous models so let's

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:34.840 
of changes from previous models so let's
have<00:00:33.410> a<00:00:33.470> look<00:00:33.620> at<00:00:33.770> it<00:00:33.860> on<00:00:34.070> the<00:00:34.100> closer<00:00:34.400> features

00:00:34.840 --> 00:00:34.850 
have a look at it on the closer features

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:37.240 
have a look at it on the closer features
of<00:00:34.970> this<00:00:35.060> camera<00:00:35.480> so<00:00:36.200> this<00:00:36.320> model<00:00:36.530> has<00:00:36.739> an<00:00:36.860> 18
