really nice on the paper

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:39.110 
really nice on the paper
now<00:00:37.469> you<00:00:37.530> could<00:00:37.829> stick<00:00:38.100> tinfoil<00:00:38.640> over<00:00:38.969> this

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:39.120 
now you could stick tinfoil over this

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:41.180 
now you could stick tinfoil over this
and<00:00:39.360> then<00:00:39.480> put<00:00:39.809> popsicle<00:00:40.530> sticks<00:00:40.739> to<00:00:40.860> the<00:00:40.980> top

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:43.020

easier<00:00:43.340> sticking<00:00:44.340> in<00:00:44.430> the<00:00:44.520> freezer<00:00:44.820> for<00:00:44.969> a<00:00:45.210> few

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:45.270 
easier sticking in the freezer for a few

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:47.180 
easier sticking in the freezer for a few
hours<00:00:45.719> and<00:00:46.079> it's<00:00:46.230> gonna<00:00:46.320> come<00:00:46.649> out<00:00:46.770> like<00:00:46.950> this

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:47.190
