00:00:56.200 --> 00:01:00.210
 but that's not all but this 

00:01:03.880 --> 00:01:09.010
 of passengers 

00:01:06.760 --> 00:01:12.310
 they are also adapted import plates 

00:01:09.010 --> 00:01:16.240
 also manufactured by me is totally 

00:01:12.310 --> 00:01:17.540
 sealed from metal wood also 

00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:20.270
 manufactured by me 

00:01:17.540 --> 00:01:22.609
 in the demon adaptation 

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:25.750
 This mode keeps the motive very well 

00:01:22.609 --> 00:01:28.150
 great to say muted 

00:01:25.750 --> 00:01:31.230
 so that an adaptation is made 

00:01:28.150 --> 00:01:31.230
 adaptation depends 

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:35.900
 and what removes him puts the filter 

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:38.030
 scrubber 

00:01:35.900 --> 00:01:42.410
 why a hose and you put a 9 more 

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:45.760
 small because it has perfectly and the 

00:01:42.410 --> 00:01:45.760
 change is little 

00:01:45.820 --> 00:01:48.600
 the minimum 

00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:53.800
 the adaptation of the sponges that bring 

00:01:51.790 --> 00:01:55.470
 to recent bikes this 2009 did not bring us 

00:01:53.800 --> 00:01:57.510
 stars art 

00:01:55.470 --> 00:02:00.570
 there is also the summer the original of 

00:01:57.510 --> 00:02:04.360
 she is from the recent months 

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:07.520
 anklets and the famous terara 

00:02:04.360 --> 00:02:09.410
 I am from Guatemala and here in Guatemala 

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:12.129
 very difficult to find bibs so 

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:14.470
 this factory of this milk up to 100 

00:02:12.129 --> 00:02:16.260
 made of metal 

00:02:14.470 --> 00:02:18.659
 this chest 

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:20.790
 and he stays a lot of work he stayed almost 

00:02:18.659 --> 00:02:24.450
 identical to the original 

00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:27.329
 and the expense was much less than how 

00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:29.540
 You would prefer to glass and you have left 

00:02:27.329 --> 00:02:31.219
 much more resistant 

00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:32.840
 as are all those how are 

00:02:31.219 --> 00:02:35.930
 fibers 

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:38.260
 produces a blow is great where it happens 

00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:38.260
 nothing 

00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:44.380
 very nice the bike 

00:02:41.950 --> 00:02:46.380
 very nice the bike 

00:02:44.380 --> 00:02:49.350
 this modification 

00:02:46.380 --> 00:02:52.830
 it has a high like 3500 of four thousand 

00:02:49.350 --> 00:02:55.319
 quetzales is including painting 

00:02:52.830 --> 00:02:58.769
 all modifications that have 

00:02:55.319 --> 00:03:00.499
 it is a dispose and everything else what I 

00:02:58.769 --> 00:03:03.610
 is pending to do my motorcycle 

00:03:00.499 --> 00:03:07.370
 because I still have something left to do 

00:03:03.610 --> 00:03:10.150
 it's the escape I'm going to take this escape 

00:03:07.370 --> 00:03:12.610
 and I could put you 

00:03:10.150 --> 00:03:14.860
 2 here below the tail this is left 

00:03:12.610 --> 00:03:16.350
 pending for a disc brake to the 

00:03:14.860 --> 00:03:18.870
 rear 

00:03:16.350 --> 00:03:21.150
 I'm going to put the tacos here 

00:03:18.870 --> 00:03:22.740
 that and remove these bases for what 

00:03:21.150 --> 00:03:25.160
 we want to be dynamic with what the 

00:03:22.740 --> 00:03:25.160
 line 

00:03:29.050 --> 00:03:33.730
 I'm also going to change that tenth because 

00:03:31.180 --> 00:03:35.540
 you are 2009 the rudder shared in three 

00:03:33.730 --> 00:03:37.830
 pieces 

00:03:35.540 --> 00:03:40.070
 but I'm also going to change it 

00:03:37.830 --> 00:03:44.280
 so that is to say 

00:03:40.070 --> 00:03:46.820
 If you have liked a lot, I am from 

00:03:44.280 --> 00:03:46.820
 Guatemala
