00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:07.100
 Wedig pleasing 

00:00:07.100 --> 00:00:10.159
 the 19 more 

00:00:10.159 --> 00:00:13.159
 Caron stops 

00:00:14.539 --> 00:00:16.890
 here psychic the Swedes saw services 8 

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:20.740
 It is always nice to see how seriously the modern Western countries 

00:00:20.740 --> 00:00:21.600
 world 

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:24.460
 to take their own call for democracy 

00:00:24.460 --> 00:00:28.470
 Inspired by the successes of Tunisians, people in Egypt have 

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:33.970
 after 32 years of courage found the attempt to undertake their version of 

00:00:33.970 --> 00:00:36.700
 Get rid of Erich Honecker 

00:00:36.700 --> 00:00:40.510
 listen to the jubilation in the oh so much interested in democracy countries of the 

00:00:40.510 --> 00:00:41.560
 West 

00:00:41.560 --> 00:00:43.250
 what the students worry about 

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:45.570
 what should come after Mubarak 

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:48.600
 this dictator has dominated Egypt for 30 years with the help of 

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:50.240
 state of emergency 

00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:54.320
 just like once the Honecker he democratically perpetuates every few years 

00:00:54.320 --> 00:00:56.040
 Electoral fraud world 

00:00:56.040 --> 00:01:00.270
 the difference between Homberg Ohm Oberrad is that Mubarak for 

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:02.640
 the West was and is useful 

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:06.380
 "It ensures stability in a region responsible for the energy supply 

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:09.030
 of the West is not unimportant 

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:11.539
 as the Shah of Persia made sure at that time 

00:01:11.539 --> 00:01:14.850
 that BP was able to get the Iranian oil well from Borken 

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:18.659
 The West also has no interest in a democracy in the majority 

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:21.650
 could possibly speak out for a policy that the 

00:01:21.650 --> 00:01:25.070
 economic interests of the West would harm 

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:28.870
 the Dispo Tac times less Iran is vilified and attacked WÃ¼st 

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:32.810
 but not only that Bolt is tyrannizing his people 

00:01:33.370 --> 00:01:38.060
 with that, Westender had and also had Ben Ali in Tunisia Dynamo was on 

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:41.680
 Egypt or the dynasty in Saudi Arabia never a problem 

00:01:42.480 --> 00:01:46.090
 No, the problem of Michelle's work is that he's not for that 

00:01:46.090 --> 00:01:49.220
 economic interests of the West works 

00:01:49.220 --> 00:01:52.270
 this circumstance does not make him a sympathetic man for me now 

00:01:52.870 --> 00:01:57.140
 but the democratic antagonist of Egypt's Mubarak is the West 

00:01:57.140 --> 00:01:58.810
 not well, too 

00:01:58.810 --> 00:02:03.110
 The Nobel Peace Prize laureate El Baradei Ried has once been the head of the 

00:02:03.110 --> 00:02:07.009
 international nuclear authority in the war against Hussein 

00:02:07.690 --> 00:02:12.210
 he has said to the end that the US and UK have no evidence of 

00:02:12.210 --> 00:02:14.630
 the existence of weapons of mass destruction in Iraq 

00:02:14.630 --> 00:02:16.109
 submitted 

00:02:16.109 --> 00:02:19.209
 the man has collected small wound points in the west 

00:02:19.209 --> 00:02:23.510
 The West is a cooperative that Bolt always sympathetic than a 

00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:25.179
 idiosyncratic democrat 

00:02:25.179 --> 00:02:29.279
 and just as after the fall of the Shah of Persia, the West to the end 

00:02:29.279 --> 00:02:33.189
 After all, after the fall of Mubarak, everyone supported 

00:02:33.189 --> 00:02:38.169
 Desperate questions why the Egyptians are quite democratically a government 

00:02:38.169 --> 00:02:41.859
 choose that does not correspond to the ideas of the West 

00:02:41.859 --> 00:02:44.449
 and especially before canceled in Israel 

00:02:44.449 --> 00:02:45.089
 until recently
