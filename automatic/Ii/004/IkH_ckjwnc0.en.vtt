watercolor what is you pole and why is
it<00:00:21.230> so<00:00:21.470> much<00:00:21.650> fun<00:00:21.859> you<00:00:22.759> Poe<00:00:22.970> is<00:00:23.150> a<00:00:23.179> synthetic

00:00:23.859 --> 00:00:23.869 
it so much fun you Poe is a synthetic

00:00:23.869 --> 00:00:28.509 
it so much fun you Poe is a synthetic
paper<00:00:24.109> made<00:00:24.679> out<00:00:24.859> of<00:00:25.039> polypropylene<00:00:27.279> it<00:00:28.279> is

00:00:28.509 --> 00:00:28.519 
paper made out of polypropylene it is

00:00:28.519 --> 00:00:32.170 
paper made out of polypropylene it is
plastic<00:00:29.390> and<00:00:29.949> it<00:00:30.949> has<00:00:31.039> two<00:00:31.579> main<00:00:31.999> advantages

00:00:32.170 --> 00:00:32.180 
plastic and it has two main advantages

00:00:32.180 --> 00:00:35.500 
plastic and it has two main advantages
two<00:00:32.930> advantages<00:00:33.500> that<00:00:33.620> I<00:00:33.680> really<00:00:34.190> like<00:00:34.399> one<00:00:35.060> is

00:00:35.500 --> 00:00:35.510 
two advantages that I really like one is

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:38.140 
two advantages that I really like one is
the<00:00:35.870> textural<00:00:36.350> possibilities<00:00:37.040> where<00:00:37.730> gravity

00:00:38.140 --> 00:00:38.150 
the textural possibilities where gravity

00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:41.200 
the textural possibilities where gravity
acts<00:00:38.660> on<00:00:38.960> water<00:00:39.320> and<00:00:39.650> paint<00:00:40.010> and<00:00:40.250> this<00:00:40.880> very

00:00:41.200 --> 00:00:41.210 
acts on water and paint and this very

00:00:41.210 --> 00:00:43.330 
acts on water and paint and this very
slick<00:00:41.450> paper<00:00:41.690> and<00:00:42.410> creates<00:00:42.830> textures<00:00:43.310> that

00:00:43.330 --> 00:00:43.340 
slick paper and creates textures that

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:45.360 
slick paper and creates textures that
are<00:00:43.580> really<00:00:44.060> not<00:00:44.210> achievable<00:00:44.690> any<00:00:45.020> other<00:00:45.140> way

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:45.370 
are really not achievable any other way

00:00:45.370 --> 00:00:49.210 
are really not achievable any other way
to<00:00:46.570> subtract<00:00:47.570> ability<00:00:48.080> because<00:00:48.710> it's<00:00:48.920> slick

00:00:49.210 --> 00:00:49.220 
to subtract ability because it's slick

00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:50.650 
to subtract ability because it's slick
and<00:00:49.400> the<00:00:49.460> paint<00:00:49.730> sits<00:00:50.030> up<00:00:50.150> on<00:00:50.270> the<00:00:50.330> surface

00:00:50.650 --> 00:00:50.660 
and the paint sits up on the surface

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:54.700 
and the paint sits up on the surface
it's<00:00:51.200> very<00:00:51.350> easy<00:00:51.860> to<00:00:52.160> remove<00:00:53.380> essentially<00:00:54.380> no

00:00:54.700 --> 00:00:54.710 
it's very easy to remove essentially no

00:00:54.710 --> 00:00:55.330 
it's very easy to remove essentially no

you<00:01:18.500> notice<00:01:18.770> I'm<00:01:18.890> avoiding<00:01:19.430> the<00:01:19.820> middle<00:01:20.240> of

00:01:20.410 --> 00:01:20.420 
you notice I'm avoiding the middle of

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:21.249 
you notice I'm avoiding the middle of
this<00:01:20.630> right<00:01:20.960> now

00:01:21.249 --> 00:01:21.259 
this right now

00:01:21.259 --> 00:01:24.340 
this right now
this<00:01:21.950> is<00:01:22.159> ultramarine<00:01:22.729> blue<00:01:23.049> that<00:01:24.049> I<00:01:24.170> have

00:01:24.340 --> 00:01:24.350 
this is ultramarine blue that I have

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:27.270 
this is ultramarine blue that I have
around<00:01:24.680> the<00:01:24.830> periphery<00:01:25.130> and<00:01:25.970> the<00:01:26.119> opposite<00:01:26.810> on

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:27.280 
around the periphery and the opposite on

00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:31.690 
around the periphery and the opposite on
our<00:01:28.960> color<00:01:29.960> wheel<00:01:30.049> the<00:01:30.619> opposite<00:01:31.250> color<00:01:31.430> the

00:01:31.690 --> 00:01:31.700 
our color wheel the opposite color the

our color wheel the opposite color the
complement<00:01:32.360> to<00:01:32.509> blue<00:01:32.750> is<00:01:32.930> orange<00:01:33.320> I<00:01:33.759> have<00:01:34.759> red

00:01:35.020 --> 00:01:35.030 
complement to blue is orange I have red

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:38.050 
complement to blue is orange I have red
and<00:01:35.180> yellow<00:01:35.330> right<00:01:35.750> here<00:01:35.780> and<00:01:36.320> if<00:01:37.190> I<00:01:37.399> mix<00:01:37.789> those

00:01:38.050 --> 00:01:38.060 
and yellow right here and if I mix those

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:39.760 
and yellow right here and if I mix those
together<00:01:38.330> it's<00:01:38.720> going<00:01:38.899> to<00:01:38.960> create<00:01:39.229> an<00:01:39.380> orange

00:01:39.760 --> 00:01:39.770 
together it's going to create an orange

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:42.010 
together it's going to create an orange
and<00:01:40.009> then<00:01:40.520> if<00:01:40.640> I<00:01:40.759> mixed<00:01:41.240> all<00:01:41.390> that<00:01:41.659> with<00:01:41.899> the

00:01:42.010 --> 00:01:42.020 
and then if I mixed all that with the

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:44.830 
and then if I mixed all that with the
blue<00:01:42.289> it<00:01:42.619> would<00:01:42.830> create<00:01:43.549> a<00:01:43.580> neutral<00:01:43.820> or<00:01:44.240> some

00:01:44.830 --> 00:01:44.840 
blue it would create a neutral or some

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:46.779 
blue it would create a neutral or some
kind<00:01:45.110> of<00:01:45.170> neutralized<00:01:45.770> color<00:01:46.070> because<00:01:46.610> of<00:01:46.640> the

00:01:46.779 --> 00:01:46.789 
kind of neutralized color because of the

00:01:46.789 --> 00:01:49.719 
kind of neutralized color because of the
complements<00:01:47.689> mixing<00:01:48.080> so<00:01:48.619> at<00:01:48.890> this<00:01:49.189> point<00:01:49.490> I'm

00:01:49.719 --> 00:01:49.729 
complements mixing so at this point I'm

00:01:49.729 --> 00:01:52.029 
complements mixing so at this point I'm
going<00:01:50.030> to<00:01:50.149> my<00:01:50.539> water<00:01:50.899> bucket<00:01:51.380> and<00:01:51.740> I'm<00:01:51.860> going

00:01:52.029 --> 00:01:52.039 
going to my water bucket and I'm going

00:01:52.039 --> 00:01:54.669 
going to my water bucket and I'm going

gonna<00:02:27.890> do<00:02:28.040> a<00:02:28.070> little<00:02:28.310> mixing<00:02:28.760> and<00:02:29.000> look<00:02:29.450> what

00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:29.630 
gonna do a little mixing and look what

00:02:29.630 --> 00:02:32.440
