 Bringing you another video of this 

00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:14.700
 time for the first time on the channel you 

00:00:12.059 --> 00:00:16.500
 watching mother cleide bellfield 4 

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:18.539
 you may already have had some 

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:20.970
 three gameplay serve battlefield 

00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:22.710
 their live commentary things 

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:25.050
 the personal kind ended up liking let's go 

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:27.570
 see if now also in 4 you like 

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:30.359
 but in any way personal when 

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:32.850
 released the pf code was practically 

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:35.309
 together at the end of 2013 

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:37.350
 I said I'll get the code first. 

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:39.980
 fps because I like wanting more 

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:41.940
 or is not the focus of the channel is record 

00:00:39.980 --> 00:00:43.680
 neowin koff last 

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:47.160
 but I said as soon as possible I will 

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:50.340
 taking the bf and I play code the focus of the 

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:52.500
 channel is record and I preferred code is 

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:54.660
 basically because his gameplay 

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:56.309
 if more adapts it your style of play and 

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:58.410
 understood and does not mean that I do not 

00:00:56.309 --> 00:01:00.570
 can play other games because fps in 

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:03.059
 general is a passion that I have are 

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:06.060
 games that I like a lot of my I have 

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:08.520
 I had the home front I have two more 

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:12.030
 I have now the neighborhood was 4 is the 

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:13.890
 goal was the three then I got the 

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:16.080
 code is only a game more also to me 

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:18.210
 I do not see this fanboys war that 

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:20.250
 You end up having a lot then I hope 

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:23.310
 do not have any fan talking boy 

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:24.869
 shit decod no cut boy 

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:26.729
 talking shit df 

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:28.259
 the channel is mine I bring what I want 

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:29.670
 if I'm enjoying a game if 

00:01:28.259 --> 00:01:32.549
 to bring a game if 

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:34.320
 I'm playing the game above all else. 

00:01:32.549 --> 00:01:37.259
 I will bring in the channel as was the case 

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:39.869
 appears gta5 to appear fifa 14 and 

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:42.180
 Did you like the other one I brought? 

00:01:39.869 --> 00:01:44.340
 But of course what you want is going 

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:46.500
 be a priority in the channel but do not be 

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:48.630
 I am thinking that I will not be able to tell us 

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:51.000
 diversified beauty games 

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:53.369
 then personal passing from that part and 

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:56.130
 People have to be talking unfortunately. 

00:01:53.369 --> 00:01:58.829
 about fanboys and such 

00:01:56.130 --> 00:02:00.509
 no fights then please and though there 

00:01:58.829 --> 00:02:02.219
 so for my impressions I'm 

00:02:00.509 --> 00:02:04.439
 Finding spectacular game the game is 

00:02:02.219 --> 00:02:06.869
 very cool, it 's very beautiful, I 'm 

00:02:04.439 --> 00:02:08.700
 really enjoying it, I do not see it 

00:02:06.869 --> 00:02:10.800
 This game as a simulator is very 

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:13.380
 people say that this game is a simulator that 

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:15.690
 code that was cage I do not know what is more 

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:18.030
 that I do not think the two games are 

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:19.890
 files of course he battlefield it 

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:22.590
 Pull a little closer to the simulation 

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:24.930
 But I've come to realize this with the 

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:27.000
 playing time I have on the bed does not 

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:30.210
 it becomes a personal simulator game 

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:32.070
 there is some kind of simulation yes it is not 

00:02:30.210 --> 00:02:34.290
 I remember the name now, I did not play but I 

00:02:32.070 --> 00:02:35.940
 I already saw video I 've seen friends playing not 

00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:38.040
 remember exactly name if you want 

00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:41.640
 I can leave it in the description then only 

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:42.780
 You ask but pf does not arrive. 

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:44.730
 simulator 

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:47.490
 I do not have problems with this I think 

00:02:44.730 --> 00:02:48.840
 This is more for us to name. 

00:02:47.490 --> 00:02:50.820
 a game than anything else 

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:52.470
 I think before the game simulator the 

00:02:50.820 --> 00:02:54.090
 time we have're enjoying 

00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:55.770
 playing and having fun 

00:02:54.090 --> 00:02:57.810
 unfortunately the last two codes 

00:02:55.770 --> 00:03:01.740
 were the ones who had the least fun were 

00:02:57.810 --> 00:03:02.760
 two cups 2 and the safe goal and now x 

00:03:01.740 --> 00:03:06.330
 it's rolling 

00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:07.980
 in this year but running forum are games 

00:03:06.330 --> 00:03:10.950
 that are good, understand 

00:03:07.980 --> 00:03:13.290
 none of these titles are as bad 

00:03:10.950 --> 00:03:16.050
 games independent of them and air-15 or 

00:03:13.290 --> 00:03:17.940
 simulator and good staff the graphic part 

00:03:16.050 --> 00:03:20.910
 It's a pretty game, but I have something. 

00:03:17.940 --> 00:03:23.100
 to say is the following my game he is 

00:03:20.910 --> 00:03:26.490
 download the digital media then it's on 

00:03:23.100 --> 00:03:28.530
 my hd and the following happens when I 

00:03:26.490 --> 00:03:31.380
 I enter the match when the Spanish owner 

00:03:28.530 --> 00:03:33.360
 or something like that happens 

00:03:31.380 --> 00:03:35.550
 pops that is basically things popping up 

00:03:33.360 --> 00:03:37.980
 on the screen knows loading time consuming and 

00:03:35.550 --> 00:03:40.860
 just emerging will be a stone wall 

00:03:37.980 --> 00:03:42.450
 in a wall does not appear but arrives 

00:03:40.860 --> 00:03:44.370
 to appear several things so several 

00:03:42.450 --> 00:03:46.440
 details loading map 

00:03:44.370 --> 00:03:47.850
 textures is also being delayed 

00:03:46.440 --> 00:03:48.990
 and I'm finding this is a good thing 

00:03:47.850 --> 00:03:53.520
 strange 

00:03:48.990 --> 00:03:55.830
 I think it may be because the result 

00:03:53.520 --> 00:03:57.930
 but anyway I think it may be because the 

00:03:55.830 --> 00:04:00.330
 game is downloaded 

00:03:57.930 --> 00:04:02.520
 is in my hd and if it was digital media 

00:04:00.330 --> 00:04:04.410
 physical media really excuses on cd 

00:04:02.520 --> 00:04:06.120
 would not be in this type of problem this 

00:04:04.410 --> 00:04:07.770
 kind of thing, so tell me 

00:04:06.120 --> 00:04:09.840
 comments please you who have 

00:04:07.770 --> 00:04:11.100
 low was 4 in the xbox version and 

00:04:09.840 --> 00:04:13.920
 Playstation 3 

00:04:11.100 --> 00:04:17.459
 in the case of playstation 3 is tell me there 

00:04:13.920 --> 00:04:18.989
 if this charge of 

00:04:17.459 --> 00:04:20.940
 time-consuming textures 

00:04:18.989 --> 00:04:22.530
 these things that come up on the screen because 

00:04:20.940 --> 00:04:25.169
 I find it a little strange not to 

00:04:22.530 --> 00:04:25.820
 but enough to bother if sometimes bizarre 

00:04:25.169 --> 00:04:27.860
 it's really 

00:04:25.820 --> 00:04:30.710
 a great lawyer takes quite a while 

00:04:27.860 --> 00:04:33.500
 really to load screen but then 

00:04:30.710 --> 00:04:34.610
 Leave it in the comments just for me. 

00:04:33.500 --> 00:04:36.890
 anyway the graphics also 

00:04:34.610 --> 00:04:38.630
 beautiful we still have those maps 

00:04:36.890 --> 00:04:41.420
 giants despite being playing ping 

00:04:38.630 --> 00:04:44.030
 efe met is that the pm and kills kills 

00:04:41.420 --> 00:04:46.130
 team is basically by the players of 

00:04:44.030 --> 00:04:48.650
 code that are coming to bf not 

00:04:46.130 --> 00:04:52.040
 I found it very strange net car 

00:04:48.650 --> 00:04:54.920
 has such a large map and had several 

00:04:52.040 --> 00:04:57.530
 players on the map then it ends up 

00:04:54.920 --> 00:04:59.600
 fastest frantic triennium game 

00:04:57.530 --> 00:05:02.450
 on the map opened lower than the 

00:04:59.600 --> 00:05:04.250
 normal is to attract more color gamers 

00:05:02.450 --> 00:05:06.740
 and also for anyone I like a 

00:05:04.250 --> 00:05:08.750
 game more frenzied and such but what not 

00:05:06.740 --> 00:05:12.230
 I also wanted to play for example 

00:05:08.750 --> 00:05:13.730
 conquest that is a game a modality of 

00:05:12.230 --> 00:05:16.700
 game I really enjoy is 

00:05:13.730 --> 00:05:19.310
 using vehicles and such I stayed 

00:05:16.700 --> 00:05:21.230
 knowing that there is a bike in bs-4 I wanted 

00:05:19.310 --> 00:05:23.180
 you know how easy it is to get the bike 

00:05:21.230 --> 00:05:24.980
 I searched there, I must have 

00:05:23.180 --> 00:05:26.960
 played the two did not pass conquest 

00:05:24.980 --> 00:05:29.090
 again but I've played well but 

00:05:26.960 --> 00:05:31.730
 but on these two conquest maps 

00:05:29.090 --> 00:05:33.500
 I played and I did not find the bike spoke 

00:05:31.730 --> 00:05:35.660
 Who has motorcycle in this game I wanted to see? 

00:05:33.500 --> 00:05:37.210
 I really wanted to take it, so tell me there. 

00:05:35.660 --> 00:05:39.950
 Where can I find it? 

00:05:37.210 --> 00:05:42.110
 then personal sound of the game is 

00:05:39.950 --> 00:05:44.600
 very cool graphic part also like 

00:05:42.110 --> 00:05:46.190
 Egypt and the gameplay remains the same 

00:05:44.600 --> 00:05:48.320
 that it a bit more gameplay 

00:05:46.190 --> 00:05:50.060
 slowed down just a matter of time 

00:05:48.320 --> 00:05:52.280
 usual too right 

00:05:50.060 --> 00:05:53.360
 I like playing code unit more 

00:05:52.280 --> 00:05:55.460
 I do not hide it. 

00:05:53.360 --> 00:05:56.660
 but I'm having more fun playing 

00:05:55.460 --> 00:05:58.760
 that I agree 

00:05:56.660 --> 00:06:00.440
 in these last days not 

00:05:58.760 --> 00:06:03.470
 It's been a week since I got this 

00:06:00.440 --> 00:06:06.140
 game then I think this is personal in 

00:06:03.470 --> 00:06:08.050
 Today's video was basically this sm 

00:06:06.140 --> 00:06:10.670
 play was more or less I should have done 

00:06:08.050 --> 00:06:13.130
 19/8 if I 'm not mistaken 

00:06:10.670 --> 00:06:15.590
 at the end of the game and we see I 'm 

00:06:13.130 --> 00:06:18.140
 to release some weapons there, but 

00:06:15.590 --> 00:06:20.060
 This time in this team 

00:06:18.140 --> 00:06:22.760
 12 mark that the young person released with 

00:06:20.060 --> 00:06:26.110
 snake family I think with snakes or there 

00:06:22.760 --> 00:06:29.180
 How do you say it and I call it a good one? 

00:06:26.110 --> 00:06:30.890
 You have to shoot a lot to kill the 

00:06:29.180 --> 00:06:33.230
 dude almost goes the whole comb this I 

00:06:30.890 --> 00:06:34.970
 I think it's a bizarre thing to do. 

00:06:33.230 --> 00:06:36.470
 various designers and almost needs pent 

00:06:34.970 --> 00:06:37.610
 interpret killing man this is a 

00:06:36.470 --> 00:06:39.680
 something that I do not 

00:06:37.610 --> 00:06:41.419
 I really like it, but I realize that it has 

00:06:39.680 --> 00:06:43.370
 guns that are better I do not know if 

00:06:41.419 --> 00:06:45.379
 delay to release I do not know in which 

00:06:43.370 --> 00:06:48.919
 class that is depending on the class 

00:06:45.379 --> 00:06:52.930
 that you play being is the salt in money 

00:06:48.919 --> 00:06:55.430
 and support or snip you can evolve 

00:06:52.930 --> 00:06:57.020
 class and releasing the weapons 

00:06:55.430 --> 00:06:58.939
 in that class I'm evolving more 

00:06:57.020 --> 00:07:00.830
 assault in the case because for the 

00:06:58.939 --> 00:07:03.259
 beginners is salt is what I indicate and 

00:07:00.830 --> 00:07:04.460
 Since I'm a beginner, I 'm using the 

00:07:03.259 --> 00:07:06.080
 health as we have 

00:07:04.460 --> 00:07:07.400
 the medical kits we can be 

00:07:06.080 --> 00:07:09.650
 using I also like the defibrillator 

00:07:07.400 --> 00:07:12.319
 is for us is using friends is 

00:07:09.650 --> 00:07:14.719
 always very useful especially when the 

00:07:12.319 --> 00:07:16.250
 people come and play is in group is with 

00:07:14.719 --> 00:07:17.689
 friends talking and such 

00:07:16.250 --> 00:07:19.759
 when a guy dies it's too much 

00:07:17.689 --> 00:07:21.650
 important is helping him to come back. 

00:07:19.759 --> 00:07:26.900
 but then the guys were playing with the 

00:07:21.650 --> 00:07:28.340
 every 12 with a salt class assalt 

00:07:26.900 --> 00:07:30.800
 I hope you like gameplay 

00:07:28.340 --> 00:07:34.580
 nothing much really i 'm still me 

00:07:30.800 --> 00:07:36.289
 My learning is not getting used to 

00:07:34.580 --> 00:07:38.659
 the game and that's it personal I hope you guys 

00:07:36.289 --> 00:07:40.849
 have apologized, anything is 

00:07:38.659 --> 00:07:43.009
 let a like like a video leave 

00:07:40.849 --> 00:07:45.529
 encouraging them to bring more 

00:07:43.009 --> 00:07:47.779
 disseminate the video and the channel and there personal 

00:07:45.529 --> 00:07:50.089
