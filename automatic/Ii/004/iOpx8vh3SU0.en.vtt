00:00:00.370 --> 00:00:07.269
 if all the states and this already 

00:00:05.020 --> 00:00:08.320
 you know that they are still new and that of 

00:00:07.269 --> 00:00:09.790
 today the truth is very interesting 

00:00:08.320 --> 00:00:11.830
 because look what it does looking at what 

00:00:09.790 --> 00:00:14.080
 does because it's great you remember the 

00:00:11.830 --> 00:00:15.730
 bread of the voice or of the lucky blogs or all 

00:00:14.080 --> 00:00:18.550
 the mod they do as objects 

00:00:15.730 --> 00:00:20.920
 totally random not good because this one 

00:00:18.550 --> 00:00:22.750
 what you add is this or it is worth you do not see 

00:00:20.920 --> 00:00:25.210
 that have an interrogation form that 

00:00:22.750 --> 00:00:27.520
 they are like a bunch of gems, but not in 

00:00:25.210 --> 00:00:29.950
 question form truth and in the 

00:00:27.520 --> 00:00:31.900
 diamond emerald gold such 

00:00:29.950 --> 00:00:35.079
 rest although yes lapis lazuli and so on 

00:00:31.900 --> 00:00:37.239
 etcetera you will find out there the 

00:00:35.079 --> 00:00:39.730
 question is what peak can you chop with? 

00:00:37.239 --> 00:00:42.519
 this we are going to test all the peaks for 

00:00:39.730 --> 00:00:44.079
 that you can see which ones are valid and which 

00:00:42.519 --> 00:00:47.620
 not worth 

00:00:44.079 --> 00:00:50.550
 with the stone without problem with the one of 

00:00:47.620 --> 00:00:52.539
 wood as you see looks like 

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:53.799
 annoying but let's see what we can to 

00:00:52.539 --> 00:00:57.820
 see let's see at the end all the 

00:00:53.799 --> 00:00:59.170
 we know that wood is not worth the 

00:00:57.820 --> 00:01:03.730
 gold 

00:00:59.170 --> 00:01:07.960
 neither appreciated the diamond itself and the 

00:01:03.730 --> 00:01:13.979
 Iron is also worth saying 

00:01:07.960 --> 00:01:17.590
 diamond stone iron and gold and wood no 

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:20.110
 Well this agreement has given us the gem 

00:01:17.590 --> 00:01:21.759
 totally random according what is it 

00:01:20.110 --> 00:01:23.470
 what makes this random gem good what 

00:01:21.759 --> 00:01:25.590
 first of all is to put craft tables 

00:01:23.470 --> 00:01:25.590
 Eon 

00:01:25.900 --> 00:01:31.869
 we see a table 

00:01:27.670 --> 00:01:34.720
 we can and it gives us trunk of acacia 

00:01:31.869 --> 00:01:37.909
 if we talk to the new man everything 

00:01:34.720 --> 00:01:41.210
 we do the breathing position 

00:01:37.909 --> 00:01:42.859
 if I do it again in the sponge what 

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:45.079
 you see is that the burned things totally 

00:01:42.859 --> 00:01:49.170
 erring for again this one answers but 

00:01:45.079 --> 00:01:52.650
 if I put one more an egg 

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:54.270
 sand a chainmail one with size 

00:01:52.650 --> 00:01:58.369
 it's because if he's growing it 

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:58.369
 right now a potion 

00:01:58.409 --> 00:02:04.570
 give me another case 61 I hope the village 

00:02:02.369 --> 00:02:08.380
 It is not a jingle 

00:02:04.570 --> 00:02:10.509
 there are some enchantments a needle is 

00:02:08.380 --> 00:02:14.000
 say that it is totally random to balzac 

00:02:10.509 --> 00:02:17.170
 hours for sponge another sponge 

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:18.849
 more sponges worth 

00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:20.170
 imagine you say nothing you do not want 

00:02:18.849 --> 00:02:22.740
 sponge 

00:02:20.170 --> 00:02:25.910
 we break we put 

00:02:22.740 --> 00:02:30.200
 nothing we break 

00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:32.630
 nothing and so on until you're worth 

00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:34.540
 they are usually born they have one time but 

00:02:32.630 --> 00:02:36.560
 it seems that they carry more works 

00:02:34.540 --> 00:02:38.330
 I was continuously sponged not 

00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:40.610
 I know when it has been spent in agreement if not 

00:02:38.330 --> 00:02:42.350
 you accept it will force you as you are 

00:02:40.610 --> 00:02:45.380
 seeing then in that case of doubt 

00:02:42.350 --> 00:02:48.260
 contents area I have borough that I have 

00:02:45.380 --> 00:02:51.620

00:02:54.110 --> 00:02:57.830
