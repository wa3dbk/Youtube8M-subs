00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:40.170 
all in the vapor line and these are

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:43.069 
all in the vapor line and these are
better<00:00:40.859> than<00:00:41.190> the<00:00:41.429> old<00:00:41.730> light<00:00:42.089> speeds<00:00:42.449> because

00:02:16.729 --> 00:02:16.739 

00:02:16.739 --> 00:02:21.030 

here<00:02:17.739> on<00:02:17.950> the<00:02:18.130> light<00:02:18.520> and<00:02:19.300> you<00:02:19.690> can<00:02:19.720> see<00:02:20.170> back

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:21.040 
here on the light and you can see back

here on the light and you can see back
here<00:02:21.430> you<00:02:21.670> can<00:02:21.790> see<00:02:21.849> the<00:02:22.090> difference<00:02:22.569> how

00:02:23.070 --> 00:02:23.080 
here you can see the difference how

00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:25.050 
here you can see the difference how
these<00:02:23.349> are<00:02:23.709> like<00:02:23.920> it's<00:02:24.430> kind<00:02:24.640> of<00:02:24.670> like<00:02:24.790> more<00:02:25.000> of

00:02:25.050 --> 00:02:25.060 
these are like it's kind of like more of

00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:28.320 
these are like it's kind of like more of
like<00:02:25.380> rubber<00:02:26.380> type<00:02:26.739> this<00:02:27.400> is<00:02:27.519> more<00:02:27.760> like<00:02:27.940> cloth

00:02:28.320 --> 00:02:28.330 
like rubber type this is more like cloth

00:02:28.330 --> 00:02:32.160 
like rubber type this is more like cloth
so<00:02:29.200> it's<00:02:29.380> a<00:02:29.470> lot<00:02:30.150> it's<00:02:31.150> a<00:02:31.269> lot<00:02:31.300> softer<00:02:31.720> and<00:02:31.989> it

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:32.170 
so it's a lot it's a lot softer and it

00:02:32.170 --> 00:02:34.199 
so it's a lot it's a lot softer and it
doesn't<00:02:32.470> slip<00:02:32.800> up<00:02:33.010> and<00:02:33.130> down<00:02:33.370> like<00:02:33.670> these<00:02:33.880> will

00:02:34.199 --> 00:02:34.209 
doesn't slip up and down like these will

00:02:34.209 --> 00:02:36.979 
doesn't slip up and down like these will
and<00:02:34.510> the<00:02:35.019> sleeves<00:02:35.440> are<00:02:35.800> not<00:02:36.040> that<00:02:36.250> well

00:02:36.979 --> 00:02:36.989 
and the sleeves are not that well

00:02:39.960 --> 00:02:39.970 
constructed as good as these are cuz

00:02:39.970 --> 00:02:41.610 
constructed as good as these are cuz
they<00:02:40.060> have<00:02:40.090> the<00:02:40.480> little<00:02:40.810> they<00:02:41.260> have<00:02:41.410> a<00:02:41.440> really
