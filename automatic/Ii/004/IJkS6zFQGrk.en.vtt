00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:32.310 
I'm talking about but once they once

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:34.460 
I'm talking about but once they once
these<00:01:32.460> guys<00:01:32.700> died<00:01:32.850> he<00:01:33.090> transforms<00:01:33.780> and<00:01:33.990> he

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:34.470 
these guys died he transforms and he

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:37.609 
these guys died he transforms and he
enters<00:01:34.799> phase<00:01:35.040> two<00:01:35.340> now<00:01:35.640> phase<00:01:35.970> two<00:01:36.000> is<00:01:36.619> pretty

00:01:37.609 --> 00:01:37.619 
enters phase two now phase two is pretty

00:01:37.619 --> 00:01:41.950 
enters phase two now phase two is pretty
simple<00:01:37.920> in<00:01:38.340> all<00:01:38.549> honesty<00:01:39.079> he<00:01:40.079> has<00:01:40.290> a<00:01:40.650> void<00:01:41.340> bolt

00:01:41.950 --> 00:01:41.960 
simple in all honesty he has a void bolt

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:46.100 
simple in all honesty he has a void bolt
dark<00:01:42.960> damage<00:01:43.320> he<00:01:43.950> has<00:01:43.979> a<00:01:44.299> AoE<00:01:45.299> doubt<00:01:45.659> ability

dark damage he has a AoE doubt ability

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:47.960 
dark damage he has a AoE doubt ability
so<00:01:46.619> that's<00:01:47.070> why<00:01:47.220> you<00:01:47.280> want<00:01:47.579> to<00:01:47.700> kind<00:01:47.850> of<00:01:47.880> be

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:47.970 
so that's why you want to kind of be

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:49.670 
so that's why you want to kind of be
spread<00:01:48.270> out<00:01:48.299> for<00:01:48.570> this<00:01:48.689> phase<00:01:48.899> so<00:01:49.380> as<00:01:49.470> you<00:01:49.590> can

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:49.680 
spread out for this phase so as you can

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:51.139 
spread out for this phase so as you can
see<00:01:49.860> it's<00:01:49.979> like<00:01:50.070> spread<00:01:50.399> out<00:01:50.579> and<00:01:50.880> won't<00:01:51.030> keep

00:01:51.139 --> 00:01:51.149 
see it's like spread out and won't keep

00:01:51.149 --> 00:01:53.330 
see it's like spread out and won't keep
distance<00:01:51.390> because<00:01:52.079> the<00:01:52.200> AoE<00:01:52.439> dot<00:01:52.770> so<00:01:53.250> you

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:53.340 
distance because the AoE dot so you

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:55.520 
distance because the AoE dot so you
don't<00:01:53.579> want<00:01:53.700> to<00:01:53.759> be<00:01:53.909> near<00:01:54.689> each<00:01:54.720> other<00:01:54.899> if<00:01:55.170> you

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:55.530 
don't want to be near each other if you

00:01:55.530 --> 00:02:01.580 
don't want to be near each other if you
get<00:01:55.680> that<00:01:56.930> he<00:01:57.930> also<00:01:58.079> has<00:01:58.350> a<00:02:00.200> shot<00:02:01.200> of<00:02:01.350> rage

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:01.590 
get that he also has a shot of rage

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:03.620 
get that he also has a shot of rage
point<00:02:02.250> blank<00:02:02.490> area<00:02:02.820> of<00:02:02.880> effect<00:02:03.000> it's<00:02:03.509> a

00:02:03.620 --> 00:02:03.630 
point blank area of effect it's a

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:08.719
