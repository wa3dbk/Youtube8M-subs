00:02:59.700 --> 00:02:59.710 
platform one of the things that's

00:02:59.710 --> 00:03:01.470 
platform one of the things that's
incredibly<00:03:00.190> intimidating<00:03:00.850> are<00:03:01.030> these<00:03:01.180> train

00:03:01.470 --> 00:03:01.480 
incredibly intimidating are these train

00:03:01.480 --> 00:03:03.980 
incredibly intimidating are these train
schedules<00:03:02.020> but<00:03:02.680> actually<00:03:03.100> it's<00:03:03.220> very<00:03:03.430> easy

00:03:03.980 --> 00:03:03.990 
schedules but actually it's very easy

00:03:03.990 --> 00:03:06.570 
schedules but actually it's very easy
we're<00:03:04.990> looking<00:03:05.290> at<00:03:05.470> the<00:03:05.650> train<00:03:05.890> schedule<00:03:06.400> and

00:03:06.570 --> 00:03:06.580 
we're looking at the train schedule and

00:03:06.580 --> 00:03:09.090 
we're looking at the train schedule and
we're<00:03:06.880> going<00:03:07.120> to<00:03:07.300> nagoya<00:03:07.860> hard<00:03:08.860> to<00:03:08.950> see

00:03:09.090 --> 00:03:09.100 
we're going to nagoya hard to see

00:03:09.100 --> 00:03:10.920 
we're going to nagoya hard to see
through<00:03:09.280> the<00:03:09.370> glare<00:03:09.580> there<00:03:09.820> there<00:03:10.480> it<00:03:10.540> says<00:03:10.720> -

00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:10.930 
through the glare there there it says -

00:03:10.930 --> 00:03:15.510 
through the glare there there it says -
Nagoya<00:03:11.650> and<00:03:11.920> Okazaki<00:03:13.980> so<00:03:14.980> the<00:03:15.070> question<00:03:15.400> is

00:03:15.510 --> 00:03:15.520 
Nagoya and Okazaki so the question is

00:03:15.520 --> 00:03:18.030 
Nagoya and Okazaki so the question is
which<00:03:15.700> one<00:03:15.880> do<00:03:16.030> we<00:03:16.060> take<00:03:16.300> well<00:03:17.230> what<00:03:17.530> you<00:03:17.680> do<00:03:17.830> is

00:03:21.870 --> 00:03:21.880 
you look down this column here these are

00:03:21.880 --> 00:03:25.260 
you look down this column here these are
the<00:03:21.910> times<00:03:22.270> in<00:03:22.600> 24-hour<00:03:23.530> clock<00:03:23.860> mode<00:03:24.640> for<00:03:25.180> the

00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:25.270 
the times in 24-hour clock mode for the

00:03:25.270 --> 00:03:28.200 
the times in 24-hour clock mode for the
local<00:03:25.570> time<00:03:25.720> or<00:03:26.020> starting<00:03:26.590> at<00:03:26.740> 5<00:03:27.670> a.m.<00:03:27.850> and

00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:32.170 
going down to midnight at 0 so what time

00:03:32.170 --> 00:03:34.380 
going down to midnight at 0 so what time
is<00:03:32.200> it<00:03:32.410> now<00:03:32.530> it's<00:03:33.520> 10<00:03:34.000> o'clock

00:03:34.380 --> 00:03:34.390 
is it now it's 10 o'clock

00:03:34.390 --> 00:03:37.260 
is it now it's 10 o'clock
see<00:03:35.260> it's<00:03:35.410> 10:05<00:03:35.950> local<00:03:36.340> time<00:03:36.490> so<00:03:36.790> what<00:03:36.970> we<00:03:37.090> do

00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:37.270 
see it's 10:05 local time so what we do

00:03:37.270 --> 00:03:42.090 
see it's 10:05 local time so what we do
is<00:03:37.420> we<00:03:37.570> look<00:03:37.750> here<00:03:38.200> epi<00:03:38.950> 10<00:03:39.160> o'clock<00:03:40.230> 1008<00:03:41.230> 1012

00:03:42.090 --> 00:03:42.100 
is we look here epi 10 o'clock 1008 1012

00:03:42.100 --> 00:03:46.200 
is we look here epi 10 o'clock 1008 1012
1013<00:03:42.460> 10<00:03:43.300> 23<00:03:43.780> 1026<00:03:44.500> etc<00:03:45.010> so<00:03:45.730> the<00:03:45.820> time<00:03:46.030> right

00:03:46.200 --> 00:03:46.210 
1013 10 23 1026 etc so the time right

00:03:46.210 --> 00:03:49.650 
1013 10 23 1026 etc so the time right
now<00:03:46.270> is<00:03:46.690> 10:05<00:03:47.470> so<00:03:47.890> we<00:03:48.040> could<00:03:48.370> in<00:03:49.000> theory<00:03:49.330> take

00:03:49.650 --> 00:03:49.660 
now is 10:05 so we could in theory take

00:03:49.660 --> 00:03:54.180 
now is 10:05 so we could in theory take
the<00:03:49.870> 1008<00:03:50.709> train<00:03:51.280> and<00:03:52.260> go<00:03:53.260> somewhere<00:03:53.500> but

00:03:54.180 --> 00:03:54.190 
the 1008 train and go somewhere but

00:03:54.190 --> 00:03:56.760 
the 1008 train and go somewhere but
here's<00:03:54.430> the<00:03:54.610> thing<00:03:54.790> that's<00:03:54.910> confusing<00:03:55.770> look

00:03:56.760 --> 00:03:56.770 
here's the thing that's confusing look

00:03:56.770 --> 00:03:58.230 
here's the thing that's confusing look
at<00:03:56.890> all<00:03:57.010> these<00:03:57.100> different<00:03:57.280> lines<00:03:57.670> we<00:03:57.970> have<00:03:58.000> all

00:03:58.230 --> 00:03:58.240 
at all these different lines we have all

00:03:58.240 --> 00:04:00.210 
at all these different lines we have all
these<00:03:58.330> different<00:03:58.510> options<00:03:58.890> so<00:03:59.890> what<00:04:00.070> do<00:04:00.160> you

00:04:00.210 --> 00:04:00.220 
these different options so what do you

00:04:00.220 --> 00:04:04.620 
these different options so what do you
choose<00:04:01.140> well<00:04:02.140> the<00:04:02.530> answer<00:04:02.890> is<00:04:03.100> basically<00:04:03.850> you

00:04:04.620 --> 00:04:04.630 
choose well the answer is basically you

00:04:04.630 --> 00:04:06.480 
choose well the answer is basically you
can<00:04:04.810> take<00:04:04.840> any<00:04:05.470> of<00:04:05.590> these<00:04:05.800> trains<00:04:06.160> with<00:04:06.370> the

00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:08.410 
ticket you bought except for the red one

00:04:08.410 --> 00:04:10.890 
ticket you bought except for the red one

00:04:10.890 --> 00:04:10.900 
that's the fancy reserved Department so

00:04:10.900 --> 00:04:13.080 
that's the fancy reserved Department so
just<00:04:11.110> forget<00:04:11.380> about<00:04:11.410> that<00:04:11.620> one<00:04:12.010> any<00:04:12.459> of<00:04:12.820> these

00:04:13.080 --> 00:04:13.090 
just forget about that one any of these

sorry other people needed to read the
schedule<00:04:21.140> there<00:04:21.260> anyway<00:04:22.040> the<00:04:23.000> difference<00:04:23.180> is

00:04:23.650 --> 00:04:23.660 
schedule there anyway the difference is

00:04:23.660 --> 00:04:28.120 
schedule there anyway the difference is
that<00:04:24.170> the<00:04:24.710> black<00:04:25.070> numbers<00:04:25.700> here<00:04:26.600> like<00:04:27.530> this<00:04:27.680> 13

00:04:28.120 --> 00:04:28.130 
that the black numbers here like this 13

00:04:28.130 --> 00:04:31.150 
that the black numbers here like this 13
correspond<00:04:29.060> to<00:04:29.210> the<00:04:29.420> black<00:04:29.690> track<00:04:30.290> here<00:04:30.770> which

correspond to the black track here which

00:04:31.160 --> 00:04:33.130 
correspond to the black track here which
stops<00:04:31.490> at<00:04:31.670> every<00:04:31.850> single<00:04:32.390> station<00:04:32.600> so<00:04:33.020> if

00:04:33.130 --> 00:04:33.140 
stops at every single station so if

00:04:33.140 --> 00:04:34.120 
stops at every single station so if
you're<00:04:33.290> going<00:04:33.470> somewhere<00:04:33.740> it's<00:04:33.920> going<00:04:34.070> to

you're going somewhere it's going to

you're going somewhere it's going to
take<00:04:34.280> you<00:04:34.430> longer<00:04:34.990> but<00:04:35.990> that's<00:04:36.170> okay

attention to what kind of training take

00:04:50.240 --> 00:04:52.540 
attention to what kind of training take
as<00:04:50.450> long<00:04:50.840> as<00:04:51.080> you<00:04:51.200> get<00:04:51.410> on<00:04:51.590> and<00:04:51.980> off<00:04:52.220> at<00:04:52.520> the

00:04:52.540 --> 00:04:52.550 
as long as you get on and off at the

00:04:52.550 --> 00:04:58.560 
as long as you get on and off at the
correct<00:04:52.940> station<00:04:53.530> so<00:04:55.180> to<00:04:56.180> sum<00:04:56.390> up<00:04:57.040> for<00:04:58.040> example

00:04:58.560 --> 00:04:58.570 
correct station so to sum up for example

00:04:58.570 --> 00:05:01.240 
correct station so to sum up for example
right<00:04:59.570> now<00:04:59.600> it's<00:05:00.170> moved<00:05:00.680> on<00:05:00.830> a<00:05:00.890> little<00:05:01.130> bit

00:05:01.240 --> 00:05:01.250 
right now it's moved on a little bit

00:05:01.250 --> 00:05:06.040 
right now it's moved on a little bit
it's<00:05:01.370> about<00:05:01.850> 10<00:05:02.500> 1008<00:05:03.500> or<00:05:03.680> so<00:05:03.830> so<00:05:04.520> 10<00:05:05.060> 13<00:05:05.870> would

00:05:06.040 --> 00:05:06.050 
it's about 10 1008 or so so 10 13 would

00:05:06.050 --> 00:05:07.600 
it's about 10 1008 or so so 10 13 would
make<00:05:06.230> the<00:05:06.380> best<00:05:06.560> choice<00:05:06.830> for<00:05:06.860> us<00:05:07.220> because

00:05:07.600 --> 00:05:07.610 
make the best choice for us because

00:05:07.610 --> 00:05:09.610 
make the best choice for us because
we're<00:05:08.390> not<00:05:08.420> in<00:05:08.660> a<00:05:08.690> big<00:05:08.840> hurry<00:05:08.870> to<00:05:09.080> get<00:05:09.260> anywhere

00:05:09.610 --> 00:05:09.620 
we're not in a big hurry to get anywhere

00:05:09.620 --> 00:05:11.590 
we're not in a big hurry to get anywhere
so<00:05:09.770> we<00:05:09.890> can<00:05:10.040> take<00:05:10.250> the<00:05:10.460> line<00:05:10.640> that<00:05:11.150> stops<00:05:11.450> at

00:05:11.590 --> 00:05:11.600 
so we can take the line that stops at

00:05:11.600 --> 00:05:13.810 
so we can take the line that stops at
every<00:05:11.780> station<00:05:11.990> and<00:05:12.350> the<00:05:13.130> little<00:05:13.490> number

00:05:13.810 --> 00:05:13.820 
every station and the little number

00:05:13.820 --> 00:05:17.230 
every station and the little number
there<00:05:13.930> that<00:05:14.930> number<00:05:15.260> five<00:05:15.700> indicates<00:05:16.700> track

00:05:17.230 --> 00:05:17.240 
there that number five indicates track

00:05:17.240 --> 00:05:20.830 
there that number five indicates track
five<00:05:17.660> so<00:05:18.500> when<00:05:18.680> we<00:05:18.800> go<00:05:18.950> up<00:05:19.040> on<00:05:19.190> the<00:05:19.310> platform<00:05:19.850> we

00:05:20.830 --> 00:05:20.840 
five so when we go up on the platform we

00:05:20.840 --> 00:05:25.240 
five so when we go up on the platform we
go<00:05:21.190> to<00:05:22.190> track<00:05:22.400> five<00:05:22.930> so<00:05:23.930> 10<00:05:24.260> 13<00:05:24.650> departure<00:05:25.100> from

00:05:25.240 --> 00:05:25.250 
go to track five so 10 13 departure from

00:05:25.250 --> 00:05:28.000 
go to track five so 10 13 departure from
track<00:05:25.520> five<00:05:25.790> is<00:05:26.180> the<00:05:26.660> train<00:05:26.900> will<00:05:27.080> take<00:05:27.110> we're

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:28.010 
track five is the train will take we're

00:05:28.010 --> 00:05:30.140 
track five is the train will take we're
going<00:05:28.130> to<00:05:28.190> take<00:05:28.340> a<00:05:28.370> local<00:05:28.760> train

00:05:30.140 --> 00:05:30.150 
going to take a local train

00:05:30.150 --> 00:05:32.990 
going to take a local train
and<00:05:30.270> go<00:05:30.720> to<00:05:30.780> nagoya<00:05:31.220> but<00:05:32.220> before<00:05:32.520> we<00:05:32.670> go<00:05:32.790> up<00:05:32.910> on

00:05:32.990 --> 00:05:33.000 
and go to nagoya but before we go up on

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:35.240 
and go to nagoya but before we go up on
the<00:05:33.120> platform<00:05:33.680> let's<00:05:34.680> take<00:05:34.860> a<00:05:34.890> look<00:05:35.070> at<00:05:35.190> the

00:05:35.240 --> 00:05:35.250 
the platform let's take a look at the

00:05:35.250 --> 00:05:39.640 
the platform let's take a look at the
electronic<00:05:35.730> sign

00:05:39.640 --> 00:05:39.650 

00:05:39.650 --> 00:05:44.110 

here's<00:05:40.650> a<00:05:40.740> sign

00:05:44.110 --> 00:05:44.120 

00:05:44.120 --> 00:05:46.629 

and<00:05:44.210> there<00:05:44.900> is<00:05:45.050> our<00:05:45.169> train<00:05:45.470> local<00:05:46.220> starting

00:05:46.629 --> 00:05:46.639 
and there is our train local starting

00:05:46.639 --> 00:05:50.920 
and there is our train local starting
station<00:05:47.060> 10:13<00:05:47.690> for<00:05:48.050> Okazaki<00:05:48.740> track<00:05:49.520> 5<00:05:49.930> so

00:05:50.920 --> 00:05:50.930 
station 10:13 for Okazaki track 5 so

00:05:50.930 --> 00:05:53.200 
station 10:13 for Okazaki track 5 so
that<00:05:51.050> tells<00:05:51.290> us<00:05:51.530> where<00:05:52.310> we're<00:05:52.460> going<00:05:52.490> to<00:05:52.699> go<00:05:52.790> it

00:05:53.200 --> 00:05:53.210 
that tells us where we're going to go it

00:05:53.210 --> 00:05:55.360 
that tells us where we're going to go it
flips<00:05:53.690> between<00:05:54.169> Japanese<00:05:54.710> and<00:05:54.740> English<00:05:55.010> so

00:05:55.360 --> 00:05:55.370 
flips between Japanese and English so

00:05:55.370 --> 00:05:58.659 
flips between Japanese and English so
it's<00:05:55.520> very<00:05:56.000> easy<00:05:56.210> to<00:05:56.360> see<00:05:56.960> and<00:05:57.370> in<00:05:58.370> this<00:05:58.460> case

00:05:58.659 --> 00:05:58.669 
it's very easy to see and in this case

00:05:58.669 --> 00:06:02.909 
it's very easy to see and in this case
we<00:05:58.850> want<00:05:59.030> the<00:05:59.120> Tokaido<00:05:59.419> line<00:05:59.570> for<00:06:00.050> nagoya

00:06:02.909 --> 00:06:02.919 

00:06:02.919 --> 00:06:05.830 

we've<00:06:03.919> just<00:06:04.250> stepped<00:06:04.460> up<00:06:04.699> from<00:06:04.910> the<00:06:05.150> ticket

00:06:05.830 --> 00:06:05.840 
we've just stepped up from the ticket

00:06:05.840 --> 00:06:07.719 
we've just stepped up from the ticket
gates<00:06:06.050> with<00:06:06.560> your<00:06:06.740> bit<00:06:06.919> back<00:06:07.130> there

00:06:07.719 --> 00:06:07.729 
gates with your bit back there

00:06:07.729 --> 00:06:09.820 
gates with your bit back there
we're<00:06:08.360> about<00:06:08.570> to<00:06:08.720> go<00:06:08.840> up<00:06:08.900> to<00:06:09.020> the<00:06:09.110> platform<00:06:09.650> and

00:06:09.820 --> 00:06:09.830
