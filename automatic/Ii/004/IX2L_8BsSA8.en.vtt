00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.300
 at stupid so cover for the night 

00:00:04.609 --> 00:00:12.420
 such a shoot your essay cover itself 

00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:15.599
 opens 220 the land is not cold 

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:22.340
 and it was always a warm cabbage loves 

00:00:15.599 --> 00:00:24.119
 warm still want to share one secret 

00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:28.199
 cabbage growing 

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:31.560
 if the earth is dense compacted then shoots 

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:35.160
 very bad hard to grow and germinate 

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:39.030
 so I make small ones in the ground 

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:42.390
 holes in order to permeability 

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:44.570
 air to the roots was very good and 

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:48.149
 therefore, shoots begin to grow 

00:00:44.570 --> 00:00:51.360
 then develop when you are going to pass 

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:53.059
 air flow to the roots and when the earth 

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:55.890
 loose capable 

00:00:53.059 --> 00:00:59.930
 well developed magician independently 

00:00:55.890 --> 00:00:59.930
 cabbage i don't do that 

00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:08.850
 dropped off to launch launches my rooted 

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:11.670
 and to reduce the work of watering 

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:15.810
 fewer weeds I had my cabbage 

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:18.920
