hey<00:00:00.450> everyone<00:00:00.810> this<00:00:01.079> is<00:00:01.140> a<00:00:01.290> tutorial<00:00:01.709> video

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:02.010 
hey everyone this is a tutorial video

00:00:02.010 --> 00:00:04.460 
hey everyone this is a tutorial video
for<00:00:02.399> how<00:00:02.790> to<00:00:02.820> build<00:00:03.270> the<00:00:03.480> small<00:00:03.810> tri<00:00:04.110> ambach

00:00:04.460 --> 00:00:04.470 
for how to build the small tri ambach

00:00:04.470 --> 00:00:06.559 
for how to build the small tri ambach
icosahedron<00:00:04.940> now<00:00:05.940> the<00:00:06.029> first<00:00:06.270> thing<00:00:06.450> you're

00:00:06.559 --> 00:00:06.569 
icosahedron now the first thing you're

00:00:06.569 --> 00:00:09.950 
icosahedron now the first thing you're
going<00:00:06.690> to<00:00:06.779> need<00:00:06.960> is<00:00:07.200> an<00:00:07.770> icosahedron<00:00:08.550> and<00:00:09.269> this

00:00:09.950 --> 00:00:09.960 
going to need is an icosahedron and this

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:11.900 
going to need is an icosahedron and this
is<00:00:10.110> exactly<00:00:10.679> the<00:00:10.920> same<00:00:11.130> as<00:00:11.400> the<00:00:11.550> one<00:00:11.700> that<00:00:11.730> I

00:00:11.900 --> 00:00:11.910 
is exactly the same as the one that I

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:13.669 
is exactly the same as the one that I
built<00:00:12.090> in<00:00:12.240> my<00:00:12.360> old<00:00:12.540> tutorial<00:00:13.019> video<00:00:13.259> for<00:00:13.559> this

00:00:13.669 --> 00:00:13.679 
built in my old tutorial video for this

00:00:13.679 --> 00:00:16.039 
built in my old tutorial video for this
so<00:00:14.460> I'll<00:00:14.549> post<00:00:14.790> a<00:00:14.969> link<00:00:15.000> and<00:00:15.360> you<00:00:15.540> can<00:00:15.719> see<00:00:15.929> how

00:00:16.039 --> 00:00:16.049 
so I'll post a link and you can see how

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:17.930 
so I'll post a link and you can see how
to<00:00:16.109> make<00:00:16.289> it<00:00:16.470> although<00:00:17.250> I<00:00:17.490> guess<00:00:17.609> I<00:00:17.820> should

00:00:17.930 --> 00:00:17.940 
to make it although I guess I should

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:20.000 
to make it although I guess I should
have<00:00:17.970> said<00:00:18.119> exactly<00:00:18.270> the<00:00:18.690> same<00:00:18.810> it's<00:00:19.529> the<00:00:19.650> same

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:20.010 
have said exactly the same it's the same

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:22.849 
have said exactly the same it's the same
size<00:00:20.369> but<00:00:21.330> one<00:00:21.600> small<00:00:21.840> difference<00:00:22.140> that<00:00:22.560> I<00:00:22.590> did

00:00:22.849 --> 00:00:22.859 
size but one small difference that I did

00:00:22.859 --> 00:00:26.210 
size but one small difference that I did
for<00:00:23.070> this<00:00:23.220> shape<00:00:23.519> is<00:00:23.730> that<00:00:24.269> I<00:00:24.539> put<00:00:25.289> individual

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:26.220 
for this shape is that I put individual

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:30.320 
for this shape is that I put individual
Pentagon's<00:00:26.820> on<00:00:27.240> the<00:00:27.539> inside<00:00:28.140> corners<00:00:28.769> of<00:00:29.330> this

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:30.330 
Pentagon's on the inside corners of this

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:33.350 
Pentagon's on the inside corners of this
to<00:00:31.050> reinforce<00:00:31.619> a<00:00:31.769> little<00:00:31.980> bit<00:00:32.099> more<00:00:32.309> and<00:00:32.579> I

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:33.360 
to reinforce a little bit more and I

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:35.510 
to reinforce a little bit more and I
don't<00:00:33.510> think<00:00:33.690> that's<00:00:33.899> perfectly<00:00:34.739> necessary

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:35.520 
don't think that's perfectly necessary

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:37.430 
don't think that's perfectly necessary
but<00:00:35.850> it<00:00:35.969> helps<00:00:36.420> so<00:00:36.989> if<00:00:37.050> you<00:00:37.140> want<00:00:37.260> to<00:00:37.290> save

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:37.440 
but it helps so if you want to save

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:39.440 
but it helps so if you want to save
yourself<00:00:37.590> 60<00:00:38.160> magnets<00:00:38.579> you<00:00:38.730> can<00:00:38.910> skip<00:00:39.270> that

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:39.450 
yourself 60 magnets you can skip that

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:41.060 
yourself 60 magnets you can skip that
and<00:00:39.629> then<00:00:39.870> it<00:00:39.989> would<00:00:40.110> be<00:00:40.200> exactly<00:00:40.559> like<00:00:40.920> in<00:00:41.040> the

00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:41.070 
and then it would be exactly like in the

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:43.220 
and then it would be exactly like in the
video<00:00:41.510> the<00:00:42.510> other<00:00:42.660> thing<00:00:42.899> you're<00:00:43.020> going<00:00:43.170> to

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:43.230 
video the other thing you're going to

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:48.740 
video the other thing you're going to
need<00:00:43.410> are<00:00:44.329> 20<00:00:45.329> of<00:00:45.570> these<00:00:46.440> subunits<00:00:47.660> the<00:00:48.660> way

00:00:48.740 --> 00:00:48.750 
need are 20 of these subunits the way

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:50.240 
need are 20 of these subunits the way
that<00:00:48.899> you<00:00:48.960> make<00:00:49.140> those<00:00:49.379> is<00:00:49.710> you<00:00:49.829> start<00:00:50.160> off

00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:50.250 
that you make those is you start off

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:54.709 
that you make those is you start off
with<00:00:50.309> 6<00:00:50.850> stacked<00:00:51.600> rings<00:00:51.989> of<00:00:52.910> 16<00:00:53.910> magnets<00:00:54.449> per

00:00:54.709 --> 00:00:54.719 
with 6 stacked rings of 16 magnets per

00:00:54.719 --> 00:00:57.380 
with 6 stacked rings of 16 magnets per
ring<00:00:54.930> you<00:00:55.590> flatten<00:00:56.010> them<00:00:56.160> out<00:00:56.280> cut<00:00:57.180> them<00:00:57.300> up

00:00:57.380 --> 00:00:57.390 
ring you flatten them out cut them up

00:00:57.390 --> 00:01:01.400 
ring you flatten them out cut them up
into<00:00:57.539> edge<00:00:57.750> pieces<00:00:59.750> you<00:01:00.750> attach<00:01:01.050> the<00:01:01.289> edge

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:01.410 
into edge pieces you attach the edge

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:05.990 
into edge pieces you attach the edge
pieces<00:01:01.739> together<00:01:02.190> at<00:01:02.670> the<00:01:02.969> corners<00:01:03.210> and<00:01:05.000> then

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:06.000 
pieces together at the corners and then

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:08.210 
pieces together at the corners and then
bend<00:01:06.390> them<00:01:06.540> around<00:01:06.840> until<00:01:07.200> they<00:01:07.560> all<00:01:07.590> touch

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:08.220 
bend them around until they all touch

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:12.200 
bend them around until they all touch
together<00:01:08.479> then<00:01:09.479> you<00:01:09.570> bend<00:01:09.780> them<00:01:09.900> up<00:01:10.140> and<00:01:11.210> then

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:12.210 
together then you bend them up and then

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:14.990 
together then you bend them up and then
you<00:01:12.570> can<00:01:12.750> take<00:01:12.900> a<00:01:12.960> chain<00:01:13.350> and<00:01:13.680> you<00:01:14.430> see<00:01:14.729> the

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:15.000 
you can take a chain and you see the

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:17.090 
you can take a chain and you see the
three<00:01:15.299> magnets<00:01:15.509> that<00:01:15.930> form<00:01:16.110> a<00:01:16.200> small<00:01:16.500> triangle

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:17.100 
three magnets that form a small triangle

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:21.580 
three magnets that form a small triangle
there<00:01:17.310> you<00:01:18.180> can<00:01:18.390> remove<00:01:18.720> them<00:01:19.080> carefully<00:01:19.939> and

00:01:21.580 --> 00:01:21.590 
there you can remove them carefully and

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:26.149 
there you can remove them carefully and
you<00:01:22.590> are<00:01:22.740> left<00:01:23.009> with<00:01:23.700> this<00:01:24.600> and<00:01:25.049> then<00:01:25.860> you<00:01:25.979> want

00:01:26.149 --> 00:01:26.159 
you are left with this and then you want

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:28.819 
you are left with this and then you want
to<00:01:26.220> slide<00:01:26.700> one<00:01:27.090> of<00:01:27.210> these<00:01:27.390> over<00:01:27.750> so<00:01:28.470> that<00:01:28.680> it

00:01:28.819 --> 00:01:28.829 
to slide one of these over so that it

00:01:28.829 --> 00:01:33.410 
to slide one of these over so that it
does<00:01:29.130> that<00:01:29.460> and<00:01:30.380> then<00:01:31.380> you<00:01:32.340> want<00:01:32.579> to<00:01:32.820> bend<00:01:33.210> the

00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:33.420 
does that and then you want to bend the

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:36.560 
does that and then you want to bend the
legs<00:01:33.659> down<00:01:34.500> until<00:01:35.159> you<00:01:35.909> see<00:01:35.939> these<00:01:36.270> three

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:36.570 
legs down until you see these three

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:40.520 
legs down until you see these three
magnets<00:01:37.020> here<00:01:37.320> on<00:01:37.409> the<00:01:37.530> underside<00:01:39.350> until<00:01:40.350> they

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:40.530 
magnets here on the underside until they

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:43.010 
magnets here on the underside until they
click<00:01:40.799> together<00:01:41.009> like<00:01:41.430> that<00:01:41.460> and<00:01:41.930> that's<00:01:42.930> how

00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:43.020 
click together like that and that's how

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:47.450 
click together like that and that's how
far<00:01:43.290> you<00:01:43.439> want<00:01:43.590> to<00:01:43.680> bend<00:01:43.860> it<00:01:45.890> then<00:01:46.890> there'll<00:01:47.369> be

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:47.460 
far you want to bend it then there'll be

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:49.310 
far you want to bend it then there'll be
three<00:01:47.850> uneven<00:01:48.240> legs<00:01:48.360> so<00:01:48.630> if<00:01:48.720> you<00:01:48.810> a<00:01:48.840> short<00:01:49.110> one

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:49.320 
three uneven legs so if you a short one

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:52.429 
three uneven legs so if you a short one
a<00:01:49.590> medium<00:01:50.460> one<00:01:50.670> and<00:01:50.880> a<00:01:51.000> long<00:01:51.180> one<00:01:51.450> from<00:01:52.290> the

00:01:52.429 --> 00:01:52.439 
a medium one and a long one from the

00:01:52.439 --> 00:01:54.590 
a medium one and a long one from the
medium<00:01:52.860> leg<00:01:53.070> you<00:01:53.369> want<00:01:53.490> to<00:01:53.610> just<00:01:53.880> remove<00:01:54.210> two

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:54.600 
medium leg you want to just remove two

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:58.760 
medium leg you want to just remove two
magnets<00:01:55.079> and<00:01:56.329> from<00:01:57.329> the<00:01:57.479> long<00:01:57.719> leg<00:01:58.020> you<00:01:58.530> want

magnets and from the long leg you want
to<00:01:58.979> remove<00:01:59.509> four<00:02:00.509> magnets<00:02:01.460> then<00:02:02.460> all<00:02:02.820> the<00:02:02.939> legs

00:02:03.139 --> 00:02:03.149 
to remove four magnets then all the legs

00:02:03.149 --> 00:02:05.270 
to remove four magnets then all the legs
will<00:02:03.270> be<00:02:03.390> even<00:02:03.719> and<00:02:03.899> that's<00:02:04.890> how<00:02:05.040> you<00:02:05.100> make

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:05.280 
will be even and that's how you make

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:07.810 
will be even and that's how you make
those<00:02:05.490> you<00:02:05.820> need<00:02:05.939> 20<00:02:06.299> of<00:02:06.329> them

00:02:07.810 --> 00:02:07.820 
those you need 20 of them

00:02:07.820 --> 00:02:12.370 
those you need 20 of them
and<00:02:08.860> now<00:02:09.860> really<00:02:10.610> all<00:02:10.759> that<00:02:11.060> remains<00:02:11.480> is<00:02:11.870> to

00:02:12.370 --> 00:02:12.380 
and now really all that remains is to

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:16.660 
and now really all that remains is to
attach<00:02:12.890> these<00:02:13.190> to<00:02:14.180> the<00:02:14.420> icosahedron<00:02:14.810> and<00:02:15.670> the

00:02:16.660 --> 00:02:16.670 
attach these to the icosahedron and the

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:19.180 
attach these to the icosahedron and the
way<00:02:16.910> that<00:02:17.090> you<00:02:17.180> do<00:02:17.300> that<00:02:17.480> is<00:02:17.810> you<00:02:18.680> take<00:02:18.710> them

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:19.190 
way that you do that is you take them

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:22.360 
way that you do that is you take them
and<00:02:19.370> these<00:02:20.150> just<00:02:20.660> fit<00:02:21.230> nice<00:02:21.830> and<00:02:22.070> easy

00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:22.370 
and these just fit nice and easy

00:02:22.370 --> 00:02:26.410 
and these just fit nice and easy
into<00:02:23.090> the<00:02:23.180> inside<00:02:23.600> corners<00:02:24.170> of<00:02:25.420> the

00:02:26.410 --> 00:02:26.420 
into the inside corners of the

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:31.720 
into the inside corners of the
triangular<00:02:27.290> faces<00:02:27.880> just<00:02:28.880> like<00:02:29.030> that<00:02:29.270> and<00:02:30.730> so

00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:31.730 
triangular faces just like that and so

00:02:31.730 --> 00:02:36.040 
triangular faces just like that and so
you<00:02:32.270> want<00:02:32.450> to<00:02:32.540> go<00:02:32.750> ahead<00:02:32.900> and<00:02:33.380> do<00:02:34.310> that<00:02:34.690> to<00:02:35.690> all

00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:36.050 
you want to go ahead and do that to all

00:02:36.050 --> 00:02:45.790 
you want to go ahead and do that to all
five<00:02:36.530> of<00:02:36.560> them<00:02:36.890> around<00:02:37.160> one<00:02:37.370> corner

00:02:45.790 --> 00:02:45.800 

00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:50.020 

you

00:02:50.020 --> 00:02:50.030 

00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:53.270 

okay<00:02:51.030> now<00:02:51.540> once<00:02:51.810> you've<00:02:52.019> completed<00:02:52.530> five

00:02:53.270 --> 00:02:53.280 
okay now once you've completed five

00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:55.610 
okay now once you've completed five
phases<00:02:54.000> that<00:02:54.540> are<00:02:54.719> all<00:02:54.840> surrounding<00:02:55.439> one

00:02:55.610 --> 00:02:55.620 
phases that are all surrounding one

00:02:55.620 --> 00:02:58.099 
phases that are all surrounding one
corner<00:02:56.099> you<00:02:56.790> want<00:02:56.969> to<00:02:57.060> stop<00:02:57.390> for<00:02:57.719> just<00:02:57.780> a

00:02:58.099 --> 00:02:58.109 
corner you want to stop for just a

00:02:58.109 --> 00:03:02.059 
corner you want to stop for just a
second<00:02:58.530> because<00:02:59.129> you<00:02:59.400> need<00:02:59.790> to<00:03:00.439> do<00:03:01.439> something

00:03:02.059 --> 00:03:02.069 
second because you need to do something

00:03:02.069 --> 00:03:04.459 
second because you need to do something
special<00:03:02.609> just<00:03:03.060> to<00:03:03.120> these<00:03:03.359> five<00:03:03.750> to<00:03:04.140> create<00:03:04.409> a

00:03:04.459 --> 00:03:04.469 
special just to these five to create a

00:03:04.469 --> 00:03:06.199 
special just to these five to create a
flat<00:03:04.709> surface<00:03:05.129> for<00:03:05.159> this<00:03:05.400> to<00:03:05.549> stand<00:03:05.849> on<00:03:06.030> when

00:03:06.199 --> 00:03:06.209 
flat surface for this to stand on when

00:03:06.209 --> 00:03:10.420 
flat surface for this to stand on when
it's<00:03:06.329> done<00:03:06.599> and<00:03:07.079> all<00:03:07.739> you<00:03:07.890> need<00:03:08.069> to<00:03:08.189> do<00:03:08.370> is<00:03:09.019> make

00:03:10.420 --> 00:03:10.430 
it's done and all you need to do is make

00:03:10.430 --> 00:03:15.020 
it's done and all you need to do is make
rings<00:03:11.430> of<00:03:11.819> nine<00:03:12.720> magnets<00:03:13.409> and<00:03:14.040> you<00:03:14.370> need<00:03:14.519> five

00:03:15.020 --> 00:03:15.030 
rings of nine magnets and you need five

00:03:15.030 --> 00:03:18.300 
rings of nine magnets and you need five
of<00:03:15.269> those<00:03:15.420> rings

00:03:18.300 --> 00:03:18.310 

00:03:18.310 --> 00:03:22.590 

and<00:03:18.810> then<00:03:19.810> you<00:03:19.959> take<00:03:20.200> them<00:03:20.500> and<00:03:20.940> you<00:03:21.940> want<00:03:22.120> to

00:03:22.590 --> 00:03:22.600 
and then you take them and you want to

00:03:22.600 --> 00:03:27.390 
and then you take them and you want to
set<00:03:23.380> them<00:03:24.030> attach<00:03:25.030> them<00:03:25.360> to<00:03:25.870> the<00:03:26.680> legs<00:03:27.010> of

00:03:27.390 --> 00:03:27.400 
set them attach them to the legs of

00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:30.240 
set them attach them to the legs of
these<00:03:27.790> three-sided<00:03:28.690> points<00:03:29.110> the<00:03:29.800> leg<00:03:30.010> that's

00:03:30.240 --> 00:03:30.250 
these three-sided points the leg that's

00:03:30.250 --> 00:03:33.690 
these three-sided points the leg that's
pointing<00:03:30.910> in<00:03:31.060> towards<00:03:31.300> this<00:03:31.840> corner<00:03:32.380> so<00:03:33.250> the

00:03:33.690 --> 00:03:33.700 
pointing in towards this corner so the

00:03:33.700 --> 00:03:36.870 
pointing in towards this corner so the
way<00:03:33.819> you<00:03:33.880> want<00:03:34.090> to<00:03:34.180> do<00:03:34.330> it<00:03:35.459> and<00:03:36.459> see<00:03:36.700> how<00:03:36.760> that

00:03:36.870 --> 00:03:36.880 
way you want to do it and see how that

00:03:36.880 --> 00:03:39.690 
way you want to do it and see how that
polarity<00:03:37.239> backwards<00:03:37.980> you<00:03:38.980> want<00:03:39.130> them<00:03:39.370> to<00:03:39.520> kind

00:03:39.690 --> 00:03:39.700 
polarity backwards you want them to kind

00:03:39.700 --> 00:03:44.690 
polarity backwards you want them to kind
of<00:03:39.760> interlock<00:03:40.330> in<00:03:40.950> on<00:03:41.950> top<00:03:43.290> just<00:03:44.290> like<00:03:44.440> that

00:03:44.690 --> 00:03:44.700 
of interlock in on top just like that

00:03:44.700 --> 00:03:47.729 
of interlock in on top just like that
and<00:03:45.700> you<00:03:45.850> want<00:03:45.970> to<00:03:46.090> do<00:03:46.209> that<00:03:46.390> to<00:03:46.810> all<00:03:47.140> five<00:03:47.709> of

00:03:47.729 --> 00:03:47.739 
and you want to do that to all five of

00:03:47.739 --> 00:03:56.100 
and you want to do that to all five of
these

00:03:56.100 --> 00:03:56.110 

00:03:56.110 --> 00:03:57.690 

okay<00:03:57.110> and<00:03:57.290> now

00:03:57.690 --> 00:03:57.700 
okay and now

00:03:57.700 --> 00:03:59.970 
okay and now
done<00:03:57.910> that<00:03:58.150> you<00:03:58.930> can<00:03:59.140> go<00:03:59.290> ahead<00:03:59.349> and<00:03:59.470> flip<00:03:59.709> this

00:03:59.970 --> 00:03:59.980 
done that you can go ahead and flip this

00:03:59.980 --> 00:04:03.000 
done that you can go ahead and flip this
over<00:04:00.250> on<00:04:00.580> to<00:04:01.060> those<00:04:01.330> and<00:04:01.810> there<00:04:02.620> should<00:04:02.860> be<00:04:02.890> a

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:03.010 
over on to those and there should be a

00:04:03.010 --> 00:04:05.369 
over on to those and there should be a
nice<00:04:03.280> nice<00:04:03.849> flat<00:04:04.300> surface<00:04:04.810> for<00:04:04.840> it<00:04:05.019> to<00:04:05.140> sit<00:04:05.349> on

00:04:05.369 --> 00:04:05.379 
nice nice flat surface for it to sit on

00:04:05.379 --> 00:04:07.770 
nice nice flat surface for it to sit on
and<00:04:06.220> now<00:04:06.519> the<00:04:06.550> only<00:04:06.849> thing<00:04:07.090> left<00:04:07.120> is<00:04:07.510> you<00:04:07.629> just

00:04:07.770 --> 00:04:07.780 
and now the only thing left is you just

00:04:07.780 --> 00:04:09.720 
and now the only thing left is you just
attach<00:04:08.170> all<00:04:08.440> the<00:04:08.500> rest<00:04:08.860> of<00:04:09.010> these<00:04:09.099> to<00:04:09.400> all<00:04:09.519> the

00:04:09.720 --> 00:04:09.730 
attach all the rest of these to all the

00:04:09.730 --> 00:04:19.580 
attach all the rest of these to all the
rest<00:04:09.910> of<00:04:10.060> the<00:04:10.150> triangular<00:04:10.690> faces

00:04:19.580 --> 00:04:19.590 

00:04:19.590 --> 00:04:34.930 

you

00:04:34.930 --> 00:04:34.940 

00:04:34.940 --> 00:04:37.559 

and<00:04:35.940> there<00:04:36.240> you<00:04:36.360> go<00:04:36.540> that

00:04:37.559 --> 00:04:37.569 
and there you go that

00:04:37.569 --> 00:04:41.669 
and there you go that
the<00:04:37.749> small<00:04:38.229> tri<00:04:38.710> ambach<00:04:39.129> icosahedron<00:04:40.679> pretty

00:04:41.669 --> 00:04:41.679 
the small tri ambach icosahedron pretty

00:04:41.679 --> 00:04:45.019 
the small tri ambach icosahedron pretty
simple<00:04:42.009> to<00:04:42.069> make<00:04:42.219> as<00:04:42.399> far<00:04:42.639> as<00:04:42.849> my<00:04:43.599> tutorials<00:04:44.169> go

00:04:45.019 --> 00:04:45.029 
simple to make as far as my tutorials go

00:04:45.029 --> 00:04:50.189 
simple to make as far as my tutorials go
and<00:04:46.860> that's<00:04:47.860> all<00:04:47.979> there<00:04:48.129> is<00:04:48.159> to<00:04:48.399> it<00:04:48.629> so<00:04:49.629> I<00:04:49.659> guess

00:04:50.189 --> 00:04:50.199 
and that's all there is to it so I guess

00:04:50.199 --> 00:04:53.039 
and that's all there is to it so I guess
I<00:04:50.349> will<00:04:50.409> smash<00:04:50.740> it<00:04:50.889> now
