remember<00:00:12.630> this<00:00:12.660> big<00:00:13.019> old<00:00:13.230> echeveria<00:00:13.679> in<00:00:14.040> it<00:00:14.160> it

00:00:14.570 --> 00:00:14.580 
remember this big old echeveria in it it

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:16.640 
remember this big old echeveria in it it
was<00:00:14.759> huge<00:00:15.150> and<00:00:15.660> what<00:00:15.839> was<00:00:15.960> happening<00:00:16.410> it<00:00:16.529> was

00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:16.650 
was huge and what was happening it was

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:18.859 
was huge and what was happening it was
just<00:00:16.859> so<00:00:17.490> heavy<00:00:17.760> and<00:00:18.029> it<00:00:18.150> was<00:00:18.210> weighing<00:00:18.570> it

00:00:18.859 --> 00:00:18.869 
just so heavy and it was weighing it

00:00:18.869 --> 00:00:21.380 
just so heavy and it was weighing it
down<00:00:18.900> so<00:00:19.439> I<00:00:19.470> cut<00:00:19.830> it<00:00:19.980> and<00:00:20.160> that's<00:00:20.760> healing<00:00:21.060> off

00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:21.390 
down so I cut it and that's healing off

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:22.939 
down so I cut it and that's healing off
and<00:00:21.689> I'm<00:00:22.050> not<00:00:22.199> going<00:00:22.380> to<00:00:22.439> put<00:00:22.560> it<00:00:22.619> back<00:00:22.769> in

00:00:22.939 --> 00:00:22.949 
and I'm not going to put it back in

00:00:22.949 --> 00:00:24.950 
and I'm not going to put it back in
because<00:00:23.130> it's<00:00:23.310> a<00:00:23.340> pretty<00:00:23.699> big<00:00:23.910> one<00:00:24.060> and<00:00:24.330> here's

00:00:24.950 --> 00:00:24.960 
because it's a pretty big one and here's

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:29.630 
because it's a pretty big one and here's
the<00:00:25.140> stem<00:00:25.380> to<00:00:25.619> it<00:00:25.769> I'm<00:00:26.090> going<00:00:27.090> to<00:00:28.310> put<00:00:29.310> this<00:00:29.340> in

00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:29.640 
the stem to it I'm going to put this in

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:31.849 
the stem to it I'm going to put this in
some<00:00:29.880> cactus<00:00:30.539> mimics<00:00:31.080> and<00:00:31.260> see<00:00:31.380> if<00:00:31.470> I<00:00:31.560> can<00:00:31.769> get

00:00:31.849 --> 00:00:31.859 
some cactus mimics and see if I can get

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:33.860 
some cactus mimics and see if I can get
some<00:00:31.920> sprouting<00:00:32.669> some<00:00:33.149> new<00:00:33.300> growth<00:00:33.540> out<00:00:33.719> of

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:33.870 
some sprouting some new growth out of

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:35.950 
some sprouting some new growth out of
that<00:00:34.020> and<00:00:34.800> I<00:00:34.890> think<00:00:34.920> I'm<00:00:35.250> going<00:00:35.399> to<00:00:35.460> do<00:00:35.640> this

00:00:35.950 --> 00:00:35.960 
that and I think I'm going to do this

00:00:35.960 --> 00:00:39.170 
that and I think I'm going to do this
echeveria<00:00:36.960> here<00:00:37.700> because<00:00:38.700> it<00:00:38.820> goes<00:00:38.969> so<00:00:39.000> well

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:39.180 
echeveria here because it goes so well

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:42.410 
echeveria here because it goes so well
with<00:00:39.420> the<00:00:39.840> prick<00:00:40.020> campus<00:00:40.530> I<00:00:41.149> think<00:00:42.149> I'm<00:00:42.270> going

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:42.420 
with the prick campus I think I'm going

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:43.880 
with the prick campus I think I'm going
to<00:00:42.480> do<00:00:42.600> that<00:00:42.750> one<00:00:42.809> right<00:00:43.110> there<00:00:43.379> and<00:00:43.649> then<00:00:43.770> I'm

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:43.890 
to do that one right there and then I'm

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:47.139 
to do that one right there and then I'm
going<00:00:43.980> to<00:00:44.100> this<00:00:44.190> other<00:00:44.480> echeveria<00:00:45.480> right<00:00:45.899> here

00:00:47.139 --> 00:00:47.149 
going to this other echeveria right here

00:00:47.149 --> 00:00:50.810 
going to this other echeveria right here
just<00:00:48.149> for<00:00:48.390> a<00:00:48.450> little<00:00:48.840> contrast<00:00:49.469> in<00:00:49.890> there<00:00:50.550> and

00:00:50.810 --> 00:00:50.820 
just for a little contrast in there and

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:53.209 
just for a little contrast in there and
then<00:00:51.449> they<00:00:51.629> can<00:00:51.899> grow<00:00:52.559> in<00:00:52.829> and<00:00:53.100> they're

00:00:53.209 --> 00:00:53.219 
then they can grow in and they're

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:56.720 
then they can grow in and they're
definitely<00:00:53.430> not<00:00:53.699> going<00:00:54.120> to<00:00:54.239> grow<00:00:54.449> as<00:00:55.730> much

00:00:56.720 --> 00:00:56.730 
definitely not going to grow as much

00:00:56.730 --> 00:00:59.000 
definitely not going to grow as much
right<00:00:57.120> away<00:00:57.149> anyway<00:00:57.840> as<00:00:58.050> these<00:00:58.289> so<00:00:58.770> I'm<00:00:58.890> going

00:00:59.000 --> 00:00:59.010 
right away anyway as these so I'm going

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:00.580 
right away anyway as these so I'm going
to<00:00:59.039> just<00:00:59.129> dig<00:00:59.489> a<00:00:59.520> little<00:00:59.699> hole<00:00:59.820> it's<00:01:00.329> this

00:01:00.580 --> 00:01:00.590 
to just dig a little hole it's this

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:03.590 
to just dig a little hole it's this
cactus<00:01:01.590> mix<00:01:01.949> right<00:01:02.190> in<00:01:02.340> here<00:01:02.550> it's<00:01:03.149> a<00:01:03.300> very
