00:00:24.970 --> 00:00:32.000
 hello and welcome to a new one 

00:00:27.770 --> 00:00:33.590
 acoustics you can use all this 

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:35.540
 for pieces in e minor 

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:37.520
 even if a bit harder rock 

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:39.680
 Ballads are a great fit 

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:41.530
 little bit with soft acoustic guitars 

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:43.520
 to start apache 

00:00:41.530 --> 00:00:45.550
 let us look away from this as 

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:48.530
 first time the chords 

00:00:45.550 --> 00:00:50.809
 the whole is based on power courts 

00:00:48.530 --> 00:00:54.620
 Ground tone on the a-side off you go 

00:00:50.809 --> 00:00:57.730
 an e 5 keychain first finger page 

00:00:54.620 --> 00:00:57.730
 seventh bunch 

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:07.400
 grab her in the familiar power court 

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:11.280
 grip with the fingers 134 frets 797 

00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:14.300
 in addition comes the empty two upper ones 

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:14.300
 pages b and e 

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:20.070
 so from now it is quite simple you 

00:01:17.760 --> 00:01:24.350
 push around this handle two frets 

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:24.350
 deeper to the power corp 

00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:31.790
 two volumes down to the c 

00:01:32.590 --> 00:01:39.060
 be empty 

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:39.060
 and finally doubt with deeper to b 

00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:48.640
 ok so the power corp 

00:01:46.430 --> 00:01:48.640
 d 

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:51.020
 c 

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:53.500
 b 

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:57.900
 Let's look at the work of the stop 

00:01:57.150 --> 00:02:00.030
 hand on 

00:01:57.900 --> 00:02:02.460
 we play with black and here 

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:04.080
 is crucial as we are for the apache 

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:06.750
 choose directions 

00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:10.140
 Personally, I prefer to play with it 

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:11.940
 a style sweep peking that means me 

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:18.210
 start with that I complete with 

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:20.820
 tee off games to the b side and 

00:02:18.210 --> 00:02:23.810
 then play back from the high e string 

00:02:20.820 --> 00:02:23.810
 me with serves 

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:27.320
 so 

00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:36.709
 set up the deductions four 

00:02:34.519 --> 00:02:39.409
 that gives me that i say that 

00:02:36.709 --> 00:02:42.709
 most natural feel for the apache 

00:02:39.409 --> 00:02:44.989
 in that direction I have the 

00:02:42.709 --> 00:02:48.819
 whole chord sequence with this stop 

00:02:44.989 --> 00:02:48.819
 pattern slow pace 

00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:15.130
 try to play along we play it 

00:03:10.670 --> 00:03:15.130
 a little faster three and four 

00:03:24.790 --> 00:03:27.180
 b 

00:03:37.280 --> 00:03:43.790
 still a tooth too fast 

00:03:39.810 --> 00:03:46.790
 Looks like I could already play 

00:03:43.790 --> 00:03:46.790
 134 

00:04:04.230 --> 00:04:09.489
 thanks for your attention i 

00:04:06.489 --> 00:04:11.980
 Hope this acoustics lay with up action 

00:04:09.489 --> 00:04:13.950
 and power shortly did you like him 

00:04:11.980 --> 00:04:15.750
 finds a good musical 

00:04:13.950 --> 00:04:18.489
 possibility of using these ideas 

00:04:15.750 --> 00:04:21.340
 the decisive factor here was exactly 

00:04:18.489 --> 00:04:24.040
 checked out the stop direction for 

00:04:21.340 --> 00:04:25.800
 they do it with the pick and not 

00:04:24.040 --> 00:04:28.510
 be struck in china steel 

00:04:25.800 --> 00:04:31.020
 want material from this view 

00:04:28.510 --> 00:04:33.610
 please have a look at ours 

00:04:31.020 --> 00:04:35.740
 acoustic guitar tutoring course 

00:04:33.610 --> 00:04:37.690
 the video distance instruction acoustic guitar 

00:04:35.740 --> 00:04:40.150
 the new music academy 

00:04:37.690 --> 00:04:41.560
 there is material in this style and 

00:04:40.150 --> 00:04:43.810
 degree of difficulty in hull and abundance 

00:04:41.560 --> 00:04:48.180
 I would be happy if we join 

00:04:43.810 --> 00:04:48.180
