00:00:01.250 --> 00:00:04.480
 whenever I can 

00:00:10.900 --> 00:00:16.660
 Hi, I'm a former administrator of Harvad 

00:00:14.259 --> 00:00:19.779
 This is a small message for 

00:00:16.660 --> 00:00:22.509
 the bulldogs and new worlds first that 

00:00:19.779 --> 00:00:24.699
 nothing we have seen before as 

00:00:22.509 --> 00:00:27.369
 the new income explained the money 

00:00:24.699 --> 00:00:28.779
 the first weeks in the cafeteria such 

00:00:27.369 --> 00:00:30.610
 time because they are not used to 

00:00:28.779 --> 00:00:33.310
 certain schools 

00:00:30.610 --> 00:00:35.800
 the problem here is that apart from mud 

00:00:33.310 --> 00:00:38.080
 flat in the recess have very little 

00:00:35.800 --> 00:00:39.210
 ecological culture and they throw their maximum 

00:00:38.080 --> 00:00:41.800
 everywhere 

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:43.990
 we practically see that at 11 o'clock 

00:00:41.800 --> 00:00:45.380
 tomorrow the prepaid is converted into a 

00:00:43.990 --> 00:00:48.950
 dump 

00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:51.620
 If you enter this next semester, do not 

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:54.320
 it costs nothing to put in its place its of its 

00:00:51.620 --> 00:00:56.780
 rubbish there are trash cans for 

00:00:54.320 --> 00:00:57.950
 everywhere in high school and if they see 

00:00:56.780 --> 00:01:01.060
 someone who is making his fishing ground 

00:00:57.950 --> 00:01:03.830
 tell him not to nurse and pick him up 

00:01:01.060 --> 00:01:07.640
 surely he will respond with bad 

00:01:03.830 --> 00:01:09.650
 face that not because they explode part of 

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:11.780
 doing wrong has the nerve to say that 

00:01:09.650 --> 00:01:13.250
 parasitize the intendants and all that 

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:15.740
 kind of things 

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:17.990
 you have to understand that the intendants 

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:20.180
 are to clean the stains that 

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:24.500
 we would leave and if they would not be a drink 

00:01:20.180 --> 00:01:27.860
 etcetera but throw wrappings and 

00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:30.630
 bottles all that kind of stuff is something 

00:01:27.860 --> 00:01:33.000
 that we can all do 

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:35.140
 the next point is maybe a little 

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:37.659
 more important 

00:01:35.140 --> 00:01:39.670
 as a student community we are 

00:01:37.659 --> 00:01:42.490
 allowing some to be committed 

00:01:39.670 --> 00:01:45.520
 injustices such is the case of the great 

00:01:42.490 --> 00:01:47.890
 price increase in the cafeteria the 

00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:50.770
 which they transformed, so to speak, into a 

00:01:47.890 --> 00:01:52.720
 monopoly for something removed the eight 

00:01:50.770 --> 00:01:54.070
 for something the students do not 

00:01:52.720 --> 00:01:56.470
 allow to sell food within the 

00:01:54.070 --> 00:01:59.140
 preparatory for something they got that excuse 

00:01:56.470 --> 00:02:01.960
 absurd that they would not let us out 

00:01:59.140 --> 00:02:04.270
 before class club time because 

00:02:01.960 --> 00:02:07.600
 many went to buy tacos and did not use 

00:02:04.270 --> 00:02:09.039
 the patron bridge please if someone 

00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:11.680
 do not use the pedestrian bridge to go to 

00:02:09.039 --> 00:02:13.720
 buying tacos will not use it to 

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:17.290
 enter the school and when it leaves the 

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:18.640
 school neither at night nor ever 

00:02:17.290 --> 00:02:20.260
 we already showed once that we can 

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:23.470
 achieve great things as students 

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:26.410
 such is the case of the Chinese garden in the 

00:02:23.470 --> 00:02:28.870
 which had great support and despite 

00:02:26.410 --> 00:02:31.269
 that many were punished and even 

00:02:28.870 --> 00:02:33.760
 some were suspended and despite 

00:02:31.269 --> 00:02:38.200
 that will be carried patrols and the 

00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:39.940
 field with the mine nobody backed down and 

00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:42.670
 we managed to be the first harlem check 

00:02:39.940 --> 00:02:45.310
 organized from all the high schools and 

00:02:42.670 --> 00:02:48.280
 faculties of the autonomous university of 

00:02:45.310 --> 00:02:50.180
 new lion and most likely the best 

00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:53.359
 of all 

00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:55.939
 it was no is motivating but when 

00:02:53.359 --> 00:02:58.690
 We ask for support to stop buying the 

00:02:55.939 --> 00:03:01.650
 cafeteria for a few days 

00:02:58.690 --> 00:03:05.230
 and achieve that they will lower their prices 

00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:09.150
 We received a very good response even though 

00:03:05.230 --> 00:03:09.150
 we have not trained much less 

00:03:14.220 --> 00:03:20.850
 Finally as you have already seen this is 

00:03:17.730 --> 00:03:22.920
 our last semester and for the same and 

00:03:20.850 --> 00:03:25.440
 we are going to close álvaro obregón for 

00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:28.500
 our surprise and last minute a 

00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:31.710
 Fallas ball are artists achieved gta 

00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:34.170
 it is absurd to see how they transform a medium 

00:03:31.710 --> 00:03:37.430
 of expression of students to a 

00:03:34.170 --> 00:03:37.430
 cheap entertainment 

00:03:37.790 --> 00:03:42.480
 we really expected to see that so 

00:03:40.860 --> 00:03:44.160
 call it the next move 

00:03:42.480 --> 00:03:46.590
 student that had the opportunity 

00:03:44.160 --> 00:03:49.110
 to reach everyone who was better 

00:03:46.590 --> 00:03:51.270
 unfortunately focused what seems 

00:03:49.110 --> 00:03:54.540
 In the beginning, they are paid by the state 

00:03:51.270 --> 00:03:57.060
 sun they argue that we abandon the 

00:03:54.540 --> 00:03:58.800
 middle part and we abandon something that 

00:03:57.060 --> 00:04:02.380
 supposed 

00:03:58.800 --> 00:04:05.560
 because it says the page of all of you 

00:04:02.380 --> 00:04:08.290
 when you really need the page is 

00:04:05.560 --> 00:04:12.110
 for you what is of all 

00:04:08.290 --> 00:04:14.780
 we are our manna alvaro obregón 

00:04:12.110 --> 00:04:16.190
 and there will always be your fail like these and 

00:04:14.780 --> 00:04:17.910
 the body secret that we managed to do 

00:04:16.190 --> 00:04:20.910
 apart 

00:04:17.910 --> 00:04:24.660
 when what we really need 

00:04:20.910 --> 00:04:27.360
 is someone who listens we wait 

00:04:24.660 --> 00:04:29.580
 have left them something with all this for 

00:04:27.360 --> 00:04:31.990
 some time we will continue watching videos 

00:04:29.580 --> 00:04:35.520
 this channel from time to time 

00:04:31.990 --> 00:04:35.520
 thanks for all your support
