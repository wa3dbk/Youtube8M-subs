00:03:53.710 --> 00:03:53.720 
to tell you about this vinyl is that

to tell you about this vinyl is that
it's<00:03:53.959> got<00:03:54.170> the<00:03:54.560> best<00:03:54.769> class<00:03:55.130> of<00:03:55.430> them<00:03:55.820> all<00:03:56.030> when

00:03:56.949 --> 00:03:56.959 
it's got the best class of them all when

00:03:56.959 --> 00:03:58.720 
it's got the best class of them all when
it<00:03:57.049> comes<00:03:57.260> to<00:03:57.440> all-day<00:03:57.830> visibility<00:03:58.489> or

00:03:58.720 --> 00:03:58.730 
it comes to all-day visibility or

00:03:58.730 --> 00:04:00.729 
it comes to all-day visibility or
low-light<00:03:59.269> you're<00:03:59.930> really<00:04:00.320> not<00:04:00.440> going<00:04:00.650> to

00:04:00.729 --> 00:04:00.739 
low-light you're really not going to

00:04:00.739 --> 00:04:02.740 
low-light you're really not going to
beat<00:04:00.920> the<00:04:01.280> clarity<00:04:01.700> of<00:04:01.730> the<00:04:01.910> Swarovski<00:04:02.540> at

beat the clarity of the Swarovski at

00:04:02.750 --> 00:04:05.080 
beat the clarity of the Swarovski at
least<00:04:02.989> in<00:04:03.140> my<00:04:03.290> opinion<00:04:03.739> now<00:04:04.700> the<00:04:04.760> laser

00:04:05.080 --> 00:04:05.090

in<00:06:08.790> my<00:06:09.000> opinion<00:06:09.330> the<00:06:09.930> Leica<00:06:10.170> offers<00:06:10.740> better

00:06:11.450 --> 00:06:11.460 
in my opinion the Leica offers better

00:06:11.460 --> 00:06:14.210 
in my opinion the Leica offers better
ergonomics<00:06:12.020> it<00:06:13.020> can<00:06:13.230> range<00:06:13.470> farther<00:06:13.860> and<00:06:14.070> it's

00:06:14.210 --> 00:06:14.220 
ergonomics it can range farther and it's

00:06:14.220 --> 00:06:15.410 
ergonomics it can range farther and it's
got<00:06:14.370> way<00:06:14.640> more<00:06:14.670> ballistic<00:06:15.120> information

got way more ballistic information
built-in<00:06:16.260> I'd<00:06:16.560> say<00:06:16.800> the<00:06:16.920> glass<00:06:17.160> is<00:06:17.900> comparable

00:06:18.890 --> 00:06:18.900

and for the human eye you're probably

00:06:20.430 --> 00:06:21.320
