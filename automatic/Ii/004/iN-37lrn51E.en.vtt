Chris this is what we got so here's the
computer<00:00:03.510> room<00:00:04.130> and<00:00:06.859> so<00:00:07.859> here's<00:00:08.250> the<00:00:08.550> doorway

00:00:09.470 --> 00:00:09.480 
computer room and so here's the doorway

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:16.310 
computer room and so here's the doorway
here<00:00:10.280> if<00:00:11.280> we<00:00:11.519> look<00:00:11.750> kind<00:00:12.750> of<00:00:12.840> straight<00:00:13.259> on<00:00:15.320> this

00:00:16.310 --> 00:00:16.320 
here if we look kind of straight on this

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:19.700 
here if we look kind of straight on this
wall<00:00:16.710> is<00:00:16.740> actually<00:00:17.670> a<00:00:17.699> little<00:00:18.060> bit<00:00:18.300> out<00:00:18.710> from

00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:19.710 
wall is actually a little bit out from

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:21.920 
wall is actually a little bit out from
so<00:00:20.189> that<00:00:20.369> wall<00:00:20.580> that<00:00:21.240> we<00:00:21.330> want<00:00:21.539> to<00:00:21.600> take<00:00:21.720> down

00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:21.930 
so that wall that we want to take down

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:25.099 
so that wall that we want to take down
it's<00:00:22.260> a<00:00:22.350> little<00:00:22.529> bit<00:00:22.619> out<00:00:22.800> for<00:00:23.130> this<00:00:23.279> well<00:00:24.109> what

00:00:25.099 --> 00:00:25.109 
it's a little bit out for this well what

00:00:25.109 --> 00:00:28.820 
it's a little bit out for this well what
I'd<00:00:25.230> like<00:00:25.260> to<00:00:25.470> do<00:00:25.800> if<00:00:26.400> we<00:00:26.609> could<00:00:27.439> is<00:00:28.439> when<00:00:28.740> we

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:28.830 
I'd like to do if we could is when we

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:31.730 
I'd like to do if we could is when we
put<00:00:29.099> this<00:00:29.400> beam<00:00:29.789> in<00:00:30.060> bring<00:00:31.050> it<00:00:31.199> a<00:00:31.230> little<00:00:31.380> bit

00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:31.740 
put this beam in bring it a little bit

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:35.780 
put this beam in bring it a little bit
this<00:00:31.920> way<00:00:32.189> to<00:00:32.250> line<00:00:32.610> up<00:00:32.790> with<00:00:33.329> the<00:00:34.430> wall<00:00:35.430> behind

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:35.790 
this way to line up with the wall behind

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:39.770 
this way to line up with the wall behind
me<00:00:36.530> so<00:00:37.530> if<00:00:37.710> you<00:00:37.829> look<00:00:37.980> at<00:00:38.129> the<00:00:38.280> ceiling<00:00:38.820> you<00:00:39.600> can

00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:39.780 
me so if you look at the ceiling you can

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:42.889 
me so if you look at the ceiling you can
see<00:00:40.110> the<00:00:40.610> joists<00:00:41.610> that<00:00:41.640> come<00:00:42.149> from<00:00:42.420> the<00:00:42.629> seller

00:00:42.889 --> 00:00:42.899 
see the joists that come from the seller

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:46.540 
see the joists that come from the seller
I'll<00:00:43.829> line<00:00:44.070> up<00:00:44.100> kind<00:00:44.760> of<00:00:44.820> even<00:00:45.180> with<00:00:45.329> that

00:00:46.540 --> 00:00:46.550 
I'll line up kind of even with that

00:00:46.550 --> 00:00:49.790 
I'll line up kind of even with that
these<00:00:47.550> guys<00:00:47.879> extend<00:00:48.539> pretty<00:00:48.989> far<00:00:49.320> into<00:00:49.530> this

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:49.800 
these guys extend pretty far into this

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:55.549 
these guys extend pretty far into this
room<00:00:50.780> to<00:00:51.780> that<00:00:52.730> set<00:00:53.730> of<00:00:53.940> 2<00:00:54.360> by<00:00:54.510> 8<00:00:54.690> again<00:00:55.199> start

00:00:55.549 --> 00:00:55.559 
room to that set of 2 by 8 again start

00:00:55.559 --> 00:01:00.080 
room to that set of 2 by 8 again start
to<00:00:55.680> buy<00:00:55.800> tents<00:00:58.039> and<00:00:59.039> then<00:00:59.280> when<00:00:59.579> we<00:00:59.609> look<00:00:59.879> in

00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:00.090 
to buy tents and then when we look in

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:05.380 
to buy tents and then when we look in
here<00:01:00.390> you<00:01:00.690> can<00:01:00.870> also<00:01:01.050> see<00:01:02.239> that<00:01:03.239> these<00:01:03.510> guys

00:01:05.380 --> 00:01:05.390 
here you can also see that these guys

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:09.760 
here you can also see that these guys
extend<00:01:06.390> over<00:01:06.780> the<00:01:06.930> wall<00:01:07.140> as<00:01:07.470> well<00:01:08.479> and

00:01:09.760 --> 00:01:09.770 
extend over the wall as well and

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:14.210 
extend over the wall as well and
similarly<00:01:10.770> you<00:01:11.010> can<00:01:11.220> see<00:01:12.320> stuff<00:01:13.320> in<00:01:13.500> here<00:01:14.010> you

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:14.220 
similarly you can see stuff in here you

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:18.890 
similarly you can see stuff in here you
might<00:01:14.460> be<00:01:14.640> able<00:01:14.700> to<00:01:14.909> see<00:01:15.119> him<00:01:17.360> those<00:01:18.360> guys<00:01:18.630> that

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:18.900 
might be able to see him those guys that

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:22.219 
might be able to see him those guys that
come<00:01:19.080> right<00:01:19.259> across<00:01:20.330> well<00:01:21.330> you<00:01:21.810> can<00:01:21.990> add<00:01:22.110> it

00:01:22.219 --> 00:01:22.229 
come right across well you can add it

00:01:22.229 --> 00:01:27.980 
come right across well you can add it
from<00:01:22.470> this<00:01:22.680> direction<00:01:26.509> that's<00:01:27.509> what<00:01:27.720> we<00:01:27.780> want

00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:27.990 
from this direction that's what we want

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:39.620 
from this direction that's what we want
to<00:01:28.080> do<00:01:30.619> so<00:01:31.619> I<00:01:35.600> think<00:01:37.670> we<00:01:38.670> can<00:01:38.909> get<00:01:39.060> away<00:01:39.119> with

00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:39.630 
to do so I think we can get away with

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:42.140 
to do so I think we can get away with
having<00:01:39.840> one<00:01:40.229> beam<00:01:40.439> come<00:01:40.770> across<00:01:41.159> and<00:01:41.670> on<00:01:42.030> the

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:42.150 
having one beam come across and on the

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:44.499 
having one beam come across and on the
far<00:01:42.360> side<00:01:42.689> we<00:01:43.200> have<00:01:43.229> a<00:01:43.350> support<00:01:43.829> beam<00:01:44.040> there

00:01:44.499 --> 00:01:44.509 
far side we have a support beam there

00:01:44.509 --> 00:01:48.620 
far side we have a support beam there
bring<00:01:45.509> the<00:01:45.659> LVL<00:01:46.079> over<00:01:46.530> to<00:01:46.619> here<00:01:47.130> and<00:01:47.600> have<00:01:48.600> a

00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:48.630 
bring the LVL over to here and have a

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:53.240 
bring the LVL over to here and have a
support<00:01:49.110> beam<00:01:49.350> here<00:01:49.979> and<00:01:51.290> kick<00:01:52.290> it<00:01:52.470> out<00:01:52.590> just<00:01:53.130> a

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:53.250 
support beam here and kick it out just a

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:56.870 
support beam here and kick it out just a
few<00:01:53.430> inches<00:01:53.960> this<00:01:54.960> way<00:01:55.399> that's<00:01:56.399> my<00:01:56.640> question

00:01:56.870 --> 00:01:56.880 
few inches this way that's my question

00:01:56.880 --> 00:02:03.149 
few inches this way that's my question
so<00:01:57.719> let<00:01:57.990> me<00:01:58.049> know<00:01:58.140> what<00:01:58.259> you<00:01:58.439> think

00:02:03.149 --> 00:02:03.159 

00:02:03.159 --> 00:02:05.849 

I<00:02:03.329> don't<00:02:04.329> think<00:02:04.420> we<00:02:05.020> need<00:02:05.170> anything<00:02:05.469> coming

00:02:05.849 --> 00:02:05.859 
I don't think we need anything coming

00:02:05.859 --> 00:02:08.490 
I don't think we need anything coming
across<00:02:06.159> this<00:02:06.579> way<00:02:06.899> but<00:02:07.899> it<00:02:08.170> wouldn't<00:02:08.410> really

00:02:08.490 --> 00:02:08.500 
across this way but it wouldn't really

00:02:08.500 --> 00:02:14.580 
across this way but it wouldn't really
support<00:02:09.039> much<00:02:11.760> it's<00:02:12.760> about<00:02:12.879> it<00:02:13.590> they're

00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:14.590 
support much it's about it they're

00:02:14.590 --> 00:02:17.220 
support much it's about it they're
making<00:02:14.890> pizza
