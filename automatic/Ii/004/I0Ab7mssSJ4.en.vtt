00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:01.040 

so<00:00:00.210> I<00:00:00.240> thought<00:00:00.359> what<00:00:00.480> this<00:00:00.630> week's<00:00:00.840> chapter

00:00:01.040 --> 00:00:01.050 
so I thought what this week's chapter

00:00:01.050 --> 00:00:02.450 
so I thought what this week's chapter
fairytale<00:00:01.620> it<00:00:01.829> was<00:00:01.920> slightly<00:00:02.190> more

00:00:02.450 --> 00:00:02.460 
fairytale it was slightly more

00:00:02.460 --> 00:00:04.670 
fairytale it was slightly more
insightful<00:00:02.879> than<00:00:03.090> last<00:00:03.449> week's<00:00:03.750> chapter<00:00:04.020> up

00:00:04.670 --> 00:00:04.680 
insightful than last week's chapter up

00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:06.619 
insightful than last week's chapter up
the<00:00:04.799> ante<00:00:05.160> with<00:00:05.310> suspense<00:00:05.790> had<00:00:06.270> a<00:00:06.299> little

00:00:06.619 --> 00:00:06.629 
the ante with suspense had a little

00:00:06.629 --> 00:00:08.179 
the ante with suspense had a little
dabble<00:00:06.990> of<00:00:07.080> action<00:00:07.470> but<00:00:07.620> it<00:00:07.710> was<00:00:07.799> very<00:00:07.919> basic

00:00:08.179 --> 00:00:08.189 
dabble of action but it was very basic

00:00:08.189 --> 00:00:10.280 
dabble of action but it was very basic
at<00:00:08.490> the<00:00:08.610> same<00:00:08.790> time<00:00:09.059> because<00:00:09.210> not<00:00:09.870> too<00:00:10.139> many

00:00:10.280 --> 00:00:10.290 
at the same time because not too many

00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:12.259 
at the same time because not too many
events<00:00:10.469> happens<00:00:11.070> in<00:00:11.219> the<00:00:11.340> actual<00:00:11.700> chapter<00:00:11.940> not

00:00:12.259 --> 00:00:12.269 
events happens in the actual chapter not

00:00:12.269 --> 00:00:13.970 
events happens in the actual chapter not
so<00:00:12.509> in<00:00:12.630> grey<00:00:12.840> met<00:00:13.080> up<00:00:13.170> with<00:00:13.230> Lucy<00:00:13.679> grey

00:00:16.099 --> 00:00:16.109 
bringing along that giant bird we had a

00:00:16.109 --> 00:00:17.660 
bringing along that giant bird we had a
little<00:00:16.289> action<00:00:16.740> we're<00:00:16.859> not<00:00:17.010> so<00:00:17.220> in<00:00:17.279> the<00:00:17.400> bird

00:00:17.660 --> 00:00:17.670

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:19.609 
little action we're not so in the bird
and<00:00:17.970> then<00:00:18.420> we<00:00:18.539> find<00:00:18.810> out<00:00:18.990> regarding<00:00:19.500> the

00:00:19.609 --> 00:00:19.619 
and then we find out regarding the

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:21.019 
and then we find out regarding the
mountain<00:00:20.039> that<00:00:20.160> it's<00:00:20.340> actually<00:00:20.670> the<00:00:20.789> flame

00:00:21.019 --> 00:00:21.029 
mountain that it's actually the flame

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:23.390 
mountain that it's actually the flame
and<00:00:21.359> grey<00:00:21.930> makes<00:00:22.170> the<00:00:22.380> flame<00:00:22.619> disappear<00:00:23.250> the

00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:23.400 
and grey makes the flame disappear the

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:25.310 
and grey makes the flame disappear the
mountain<00:00:23.789> flame<00:00:24.000> disappeared<00:00:24.630> so<00:00:24.990> it<00:00:25.199> was

00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:25.320 
mountain flame disappeared so it was

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:27.290 
mountain flame disappeared so it was
very<00:00:25.500> basic<00:00:25.680> in<00:00:25.980> that<00:00:26.010> aspect<00:00:26.310> but<00:00:26.760> I<00:00:26.939> still

00:00:27.290 --> 00:00:27.300 
very basic in that aspect but I still

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:29.000 
very basic in that aspect but I still
felt<00:00:27.570> as<00:00:27.689> though<00:00:27.869> as<00:00:28.080> far<00:00:28.260> as<00:00:28.349> like<00:00:28.439> it<00:00:28.650> up<00:00:28.830> the

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:29.010 
felt as though as far as like it up the

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:31.099 
felt as though as far as like it up the
ante<00:00:29.490> with<00:00:30.000> the<00:00:30.150> whole<00:00:30.330> suspense<00:00:30.750> because

00:00:31.099 --> 00:00:31.109 
ante with the whole suspense because

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:33.290 
ante with the whole suspense because
like<00:00:31.320> what<00:00:31.949> the<00:00:32.099> hell<00:00:32.250> exactly<00:00:32.820> happened<00:00:33.210> at

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:33.300 
like what the hell exactly happened at

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:34.729 
like what the hell exactly happened at
the<00:00:33.420> end<00:00:33.540> when<00:00:33.750> grey<00:00:33.960> was<00:00:34.140> pretty<00:00:34.320> much<00:00:34.440> using

00:00:34.729 --> 00:00:34.739 
the end when grey was pretty much using

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:37.580 
the end when grey was pretty much using
his<00:00:34.829> magic<00:00:35.219> it<00:00:35.489> feels<00:00:36.270> like<00:00:36.630> from<00:00:37.170> the<00:00:37.320> ending

00:00:37.580 --> 00:00:37.590 
his magic it feels like from the ending

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:39.049 
his magic it feels like from the ending
judging<00:00:37.920> from<00:00:38.040> the<00:00:38.160> way<00:00:38.250> the<00:00:38.550> like<00:00:38.850> you<00:00:38.969> know

you know disappear from the flames then
the<00:00:54.750> actual<00:00:55.050> flames<00:00:55.320> would<00:00:55.500> disappear<00:00:55.829> to

00:00:55.970 --> 00:00:55.980 
the actual flames would disappear to

00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:57.319 
the actual flames would disappear to
another<00:00:56.190> place<00:00:56.370> maybe<00:00:56.520> a<00:00:56.670> spell<00:00:56.940> or

another place maybe a spell or

00:00:57.329 --> 00:00:59.330 
another place maybe a spell or
somebody's<00:00:57.719> nearby<00:00:58.140> and<00:00:58.530> that's<00:00:59.129> definitely

00:00:59.330 --> 00:00:59.340 
somebody's nearby and that's definitely

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:00.740 
somebody's nearby and that's definitely
what<00:00:59.609> my<00:00:59.699> whole<00:00:59.850> take<00:01:00.059> on<00:01:00.149> that<00:01:00.300> particular

00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:00.750 
what my whole take on that particular

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:02.029 
what my whole take on that particular
thing<00:01:00.780> as<00:01:01.050> far<00:01:01.230> as<00:01:01.320> mystery<00:01:01.680> goes<00:01:01.859> because

00:01:02.029 --> 00:01:02.039 
thing as far as mystery goes because

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:03.740 
thing as far as mystery goes because
there's<00:01:02.640> definitely<00:01:02.969> somebody<00:01:03.120> behind<00:01:03.420> us

00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:03.750 
there's definitely somebody behind us

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:05.119 
there's definitely somebody behind us
and<00:01:03.870> I<00:01:03.960> think<00:01:04.170> it<00:01:04.229> has<00:01:04.320> more<00:01:04.559> to<00:01:04.619> do<00:01:04.799> again<00:01:05.040> with

00:01:05.119 --> 00:01:05.129 
and I think it has more to do again with

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:07.370 
and I think it has more to do again with
Tartarus<00:01:05.610> and<00:01:05.729> whatnot<00:01:06.150> so<00:01:06.659> that<00:01:07.200> was<00:01:07.350> a

00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:07.380 
Tartarus and whatnot so that was a

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:09.530 
Tartarus and whatnot so that was a
little<00:01:07.560> bit<00:01:07.740> interesting<00:01:08.250> and<00:01:08.430> also<00:01:09.030> like<00:01:09.420> I

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:09.540 
little bit interesting and also like I

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:10.609 
little bit interesting and also like I
said<00:01:09.720> you<00:01:09.810> know<00:01:09.869> finding<00:01:10.229> out<00:01:10.350> that<00:01:10.470> the

00:01:10.609 --> 00:01:10.619 
said you know finding out that the

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:12.380 
said you know finding out that the
mountain<00:01:10.920> was<00:01:11.040> the<00:01:11.070> flame<00:01:11.340> which<00:01:11.520> I<00:01:11.729> think<00:01:12.270> I

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:12.390 
mountain was the flame which I think I

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:14.240 
mountain was the flame which I think I
predicted<00:01:12.840> that<00:01:12.900> earlier<00:01:13.350> you<00:01:13.439> know<00:01:13.740> previous

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:14.250 
predicted that earlier you know previous

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:15.679 
predicted that earlier you know previous
chapter<00:01:14.820> as<00:01:14.880> well<00:01:15.060> so<00:01:15.390> it<00:01:15.450> wasn't<00:01:15.659> really

00:01:15.679 --> 00:01:15.689 
chapter as well so it wasn't really

00:01:15.689 --> 00:01:18.260 
chapter as well so it wasn't really
unpredictable<00:01:16.200> or<00:01:16.650> you<00:01:17.610> know<00:01:17.729> like<00:01:18.000> a<00:01:18.030> big

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:18.270 
unpredictable or you know like a big

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:19.700 
unpredictable or you know like a big
mystery<00:01:18.630> with<00:01:18.840> that<00:01:18.990> so<00:01:19.200> to<00:01:19.259> speak<00:01:19.470> I<00:01:19.530> feel

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:19.710 
mystery with that so to speak I feel

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:21.200 
mystery with that so to speak I feel
like<00:01:19.830> the<00:01:20.009> flame<00:01:20.250> was<00:01:20.430> around<00:01:20.700> there<00:01:20.939> for<00:01:21.119> the

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:21.210 
like the flame was around there for the

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:23.450 
like the flame was around there for the
most<00:01:21.360> part<00:01:21.630> so<00:01:22.080> it<00:01:22.770> was<00:01:22.890> still<00:01:23.100> like<00:01:23.280> we

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:23.460 
most part so it was still like we

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:25.130 
most part so it was still like we
learned<00:01:23.729> it<00:01:23.970> but<00:01:24.150> it<00:01:24.450> was<00:01:24.600> like<00:01:24.720> whatever<00:01:24.900> and

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:25.140

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:26.600 
learned it but it was like whatever and
that<00:01:25.320> bird<00:01:25.530> I<00:01:25.710> actually<00:01:25.860> thought<00:01:26.250> was<00:01:26.400> pretty

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:26.610

that bird I actually thought was pretty
sick<00:01:26.939> and<00:01:26.970> I<00:01:27.150> thought<00:01:27.330> it<00:01:27.420> was<00:01:27.540> like<00:01:27.659> some

00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:27.990 
sick and I thought it was like some

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:29.749 
sick and I thought it was like some
strong<00:01:28.229> bird<00:01:28.500> because<00:01:28.860> in<00:01:29.070> the<00:01:29.189> last<00:01:29.369> chapter

00:01:29.749 --> 00:01:29.759 
strong bird because in the last chapter

00:01:29.759 --> 00:01:31.580 
strong bird because in the last chapter
you<00:01:29.820> know<00:01:29.909> it<00:01:30.030> just<00:01:30.180> started<00:01:30.450> gobbling<00:01:31.320> down

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:31.590

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:33.830 
you know it just started gobbling down
on<00:01:31.890> the<00:01:32.159> freakin<00:01:32.700> demon<00:01:33.090> guy<00:01:33.240> so<00:01:33.509> I<00:01:33.540> was<00:01:33.630> like

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:33.840 
on the freakin demon guy so I was like

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:35.090 
on the freakin demon guy so I was like
okay<00:01:34.079> you<00:01:34.380> know<00:01:34.470> this<00:01:34.560> bird<00:01:34.710> might<00:01:34.950> be

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:35.100 
okay you know this bird might be

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:36.560 
okay you know this bird might be
something<00:01:35.520> but<00:01:35.670> looks<00:01:36.060> like<00:01:36.090> knots<00:01:36.360> would

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:36.570 
something but looks like knots would

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:38.870 
something but looks like knots would
just<00:01:36.750> beat<00:01:36.869> the<00:01:36.990> fuck<00:01:37.200> out<00:01:37.320> of<00:01:37.380> it<00:01:37.619> so<00:01:38.040> it<00:01:38.460> can't

00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:38.880 
just beat the fuck out of it so it can't

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:40.640

00:02:43.399 --> 00:02:43.409 
overall just it was it was like okay

00:02:43.409 --> 00:02:45.410 
overall just it was it was like okay
type<00:02:43.709> of<00:02:43.829> chapter<00:02:44.129> like<00:02:44.280> it<00:02:44.549> was<00:02:44.730> fine<00:02:45.060> it

00:02:45.410 --> 00:02:45.420 
type of chapter like it was fine it

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:47.300 
type of chapter like it was fine it
wasn't<00:02:45.599> like<00:02:45.900> great<00:02:46.620> or<00:02:46.650> anything<00:02:47.040> like<00:02:47.250> that

00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:47.310 
wasn't like great or anything like that

00:02:47.310 --> 00:02:49.819 
wasn't like great or anything like that
I<00:02:47.489> just<00:02:47.640> it<00:02:48.329> was<00:02:48.390> like<00:02:48.569> kind<00:02:49.140> of<00:02:49.230> enjoyable<00:02:49.739> but

00:02:49.819 --> 00:02:49.829 
I just it was like kind of enjoyable but

00:02:49.829 --> 00:02:51.379 
I just it was like kind of enjoyable but
at<00:02:49.950> times<00:02:50.190> it<00:02:50.310> was<00:02:50.459> slow<00:02:50.670> and<00:02:50.940> I<00:02:51.090> think<00:02:51.239> that's

00:02:51.379 --> 00:02:51.389 
at times it was slow and I think that's

00:02:51.389 --> 00:02:53.000 
at times it was slow and I think that's
just<00:02:51.480> like<00:02:51.629> overall<00:02:52.079> this<00:02:52.200> arc<00:02:52.440> has<00:02:52.590> been<00:02:52.829> like

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:53.010 
just like overall this arc has been like

00:02:53.010 --> 00:02:55.039 
just like overall this arc has been like
the<00:02:53.549> the<00:02:53.849> different<00:02:54.239> thing<00:02:54.389> about<00:02:54.540> this<00:02:54.780> arc

00:02:55.039 --> 00:02:55.049 
the the different thing about this arc

00:02:55.049 --> 00:02:56.690 
the the different thing about this arc
upholster<00:02:55.590> like<00:02:55.739> any<00:02:55.920> other<00:02:56.099> fairy<00:02:56.310> tale<00:02:56.489> arc

00:02:56.690 --> 00:02:56.700 
upholster like any other fairy tale arc

00:02:56.700 --> 00:02:59.240 
upholster like any other fairy tale arc
is<00:02:56.879> the<00:02:57.329> pacing<00:02:57.840> and<00:02:57.989> like<00:02:58.620> chapters<00:02:59.159> like

00:02:59.240 --> 00:02:59.250 
is the pacing and like chapters like

00:02:59.250 --> 00:03:00.740 
is the pacing and like chapters like
this<00:02:59.430> once<00:02:59.609> again<00:02:59.700> display<00:03:00.090> that<00:03:00.299> like<00:03:00.599> the

00:03:00.740 --> 00:03:00.750 
this once again display that like the

00:03:00.750 --> 00:03:02.660 
this once again display that like the
pacing<00:03:01.139> has<00:03:01.290> gone<00:03:01.530> very<00:03:01.889> slow<00:03:02.190> compared<00:03:02.609> to

00:03:02.660 --> 00:03:02.670 
pacing has gone very slow compared to

00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:04.160 
pacing has gone very slow compared to
previous<00:03:03.090> events<00:03:03.420> how<00:03:03.510> things<00:03:03.959> would<00:03:04.139> just

00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:04.170 
previous events how things would just

00:03:04.170 --> 00:03:05.930 
previous events how things would just
you<00:03:04.379> know<00:03:04.409> blaze<00:03:04.859> through<00:03:05.190> and<00:03:05.370> stuff<00:03:05.579> so<00:03:05.909> I

00:03:05.930 --> 00:03:05.940 
you know blaze through and stuff so I

00:03:05.940 --> 00:03:07.190 
you know blaze through and stuff so I
definitely<00:03:06.120> said<00:03:06.420> I<00:03:06.480> got<00:03:06.659> again<00:03:06.930> with<00:03:07.079> this

00:03:07.190 --> 00:03:07.200 
definitely said I got again with this

00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:09.110 
definitely said I got again with this
chapter<00:03:07.590> as<00:03:07.680> well<00:03:07.799> the<00:03:08.250> pacing<00:03:08.730> is<00:03:08.849> for<00:03:09.060> the

00:03:09.110 --> 00:03:09.120 
chapter as well the pacing is for the

00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:11.210 
chapter as well the pacing is for the
most<00:03:09.269> part<00:03:09.389> what<00:03:10.139> feels<00:03:10.440> like<00:03:10.560> slower<00:03:11.010> like

00:03:11.210 --> 00:03:11.220 
most part what feels like slower like

00:03:11.220 --> 00:03:13.339 
most part what feels like slower like
events<00:03:11.609> are<00:03:11.730> happening<00:03:12.090> a<00:03:12.150> lot<00:03:12.269> slower<00:03:12.569> and<00:03:12.900> I

00:03:13.339 --> 00:03:13.349 
events are happening a lot slower and I

00:03:13.349 --> 00:03:14.539 
events are happening a lot slower and I
don't<00:03:13.409> know<00:03:13.560> if<00:03:13.620> that's<00:03:13.769> purposely<00:03:14.220> on<00:03:14.370> hero

00:03:14.539 --> 00:03:14.549 
don't know if that's purposely on hero

00:03:14.549 --> 00:03:16.460 
don't know if that's purposely on hero
mass<00:03:14.790> the<00:03:14.940> most<00:03:15.150> part<00:03:15.359> or<00:03:15.750> whatnot<00:03:16.109> but<00:03:16.290> it

00:03:16.460 --> 00:03:16.470 
mass the most part or whatnot but it

00:03:16.470 --> 00:03:17.599 
mass the most part or whatnot but it
definitely<00:03:16.769> felt<00:03:16.889> you<00:03:17.069> could<00:03:17.220> feel<00:03:17.400> it<00:03:17.549> in

00:03:17.599 --> 00:03:17.609 
definitely felt you could feel it in

00:03:17.609 --> 00:03:19.729 
definitely felt you could feel it in
this<00:03:17.699> chapter<00:03:17.940> and<00:03:18.209> many<00:03:18.690> chapters<00:03:19.199> prior<00:03:19.560> to

00:03:19.729 --> 00:03:19.739 
this chapter and many chapters prior to

00:03:19.739 --> 00:03:21.470 
this chapter and many chapters prior to
this<00:03:19.859> one<00:03:20.069> that<00:03:20.489> the<00:03:20.819> patient<00:03:21.180> is<00:03:21.239> a<00:03:21.269> lot

00:03:21.470 --> 00:03:21.480 
this one that the patient is a lot

00:03:21.480 --> 00:03:24.349 
this one that the patient is a lot
slower<00:03:21.629> but<00:03:22.139> still<00:03:22.199> basic<00:03:23.190> I<00:03:23.340> think<00:03:24.209> it<00:03:24.269> was

00:03:24.349 --> 00:03:24.359 
slower but still basic I think it was

00:03:24.359 --> 00:03:25.490 
slower but still basic I think it was
better<00:03:24.540> than<00:03:24.660> last<00:03:24.810> week's<00:03:25.079> chapter<00:03:25.379> because

00:03:25.490 --> 00:03:25.500 
better than last week's chapter because

00:03:25.500 --> 00:03:26.900 
better than last week's chapter because
last<00:03:25.739> week<00:03:25.889> it<00:03:26.099> was<00:03:26.129> just<00:03:26.250> you<00:03:26.430> know<00:03:26.489> the<00:03:26.609> fight

00:03:26.900 --> 00:03:26.910 
last week it was just you know the fight

00:03:26.910 --> 00:03:29.270 
last week it was just you know the fight
with<00:03:27.090> grey<00:03:27.299> and<00:03:27.599> I<00:03:28.410> wasn't<00:03:28.859> too<00:03:28.949> particularly

00:03:29.270 --> 00:03:29.280 
with grey and I wasn't too particularly

00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:31.250 
with grey and I wasn't too particularly
fond<00:03:29.730> of<00:03:29.849> that<00:03:29.910> I<00:03:30.120> didn't<00:03:30.750> think<00:03:30.840> it<00:03:30.989> was<00:03:31.049> done

00:03:31.250 --> 00:03:31.260 
fond of that I didn't think it was done

00:03:31.260 --> 00:03:32.750 
fond of that I didn't think it was done
properly<00:03:31.769> but<00:03:32.099> this<00:03:32.280> one<00:03:32.459> it<00:03:32.609> was<00:03:32.699> like

00:03:32.750 --> 00:03:32.760 
properly but this one it was like

00:03:32.760 --> 00:03:34.430 
properly but this one it was like
whatever<00:03:33.180> the<00:03:33.299> bird<00:03:33.480> got<00:03:33.629> his<00:03:33.780> ass<00:03:33.930> kicked<00:03:33.959> and

00:03:34.430 --> 00:03:34.440 
whatever the bird got his ass kicked and

00:03:34.440 --> 00:03:36.020 
whatever the bird got his ass kicked and
he's<00:03:34.919> probably<00:03:35.040> not<00:03:35.220> giving<00:03:35.699> back<00:03:35.849> any

00:03:36.020 --> 00:03:36.030 
he's probably not giving back any

00:03:36.030 --> 00:03:38.030 
he's probably not giving back any
information<00:03:36.569> anymore<00:03:36.780> so<00:03:37.079> I'm<00:03:37.709> gonna<00:03:37.829> give

00:03:38.030 --> 00:03:38.040 
information anymore so I'm gonna give

00:03:38.040 --> 00:03:40.039 
information anymore so I'm gonna give
this<00:03:38.190> one<00:03:38.400> six<00:03:38.849> out<00:03:39.060> of<00:03:39.120> ten<00:03:39.480> it<00:03:39.660> was<00:03:39.750> fine

00:03:40.039 --> 00:03:40.049 
this one six out of ten it was fine

00:03:40.049 --> 00:03:41.449 
this one six out of ten it was fine
better<00:03:40.379> than<00:03:40.560> last<00:03:40.739> week's<00:03:41.040> but<00:03:41.220> still

00:03:41.449 --> 00:03:41.459 
better than last week's but still

00:03:41.459 --> 00:03:43.250 
better than last week's but still
nothing<00:03:41.879> great<00:03:42.359> let's<00:03:42.569> see<00:03:42.750> things<00:03:43.019> move<00:03:43.230> a

00:03:43.250 --> 00:03:43.260 
nothing great let's see things move a

00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:44.780 
nothing great let's see things move a
bit<00:03:43.530> faster<00:03:43.980> never<00:03:44.310> know<00:03:44.400> what<00:03:44.519> you<00:03:44.609> think

00:03:44.780 --> 00:03:44.790 
bit faster never know what you think

00:03:44.790 --> 00:03:46.189 
bit faster never know what you think
first<00:03:45.030> of<00:03:45.090> all<00:03:45.180> that<00:03:45.239> bird<00:03:45.599> wasn't<00:03:45.870> giving

00:03:46.189 --> 00:03:46.199 
first of all that bird wasn't giving

00:03:46.199 --> 00:03:47.990 
first of all that bird wasn't giving
insight<00:03:46.620> back<00:03:46.859> to<00:03:47.099> whoever<00:03:47.459> is<00:03:47.639> doing<00:03:47.760> this

00:03:47.990 --> 00:03:48.000 
insight back to whoever is doing this

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:49.970 
insight back to whoever is doing this
and<00:03:48.150> who<00:03:48.269> do<00:03:48.359> you<00:03:48.419> think<00:03:48.690> is<00:03:48.870> in<00:03:49.139> charge<00:03:49.769> of

00:03:49.970 --> 00:03:49.980 
and who do you think is in charge of

00:03:49.980 --> 00:03:51.110 
and who do you think is in charge of
doing<00:03:50.099> all<00:03:50.370> this<00:03:50.549> you<00:03:50.609> know<00:03:50.730> who's<00:03:50.940> pulling

00:03:51.110 --> 00:03:51.120 
doing all this you know who's pulling

00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:52.159 
doing all this you know who's pulling
the<00:03:51.329> strings<00:03:51.540> behind<00:03:51.690> this

00:03:52.159 --> 00:03:52.169 
the strings behind this

00:03:52.169 --> 00:03:53.869 
the strings behind this
I'd<00:03:52.530> imagine<00:03:52.620> has<00:03:53.010> something<00:03:53.340> to<00:03:53.370> possibly

00:03:53.869 --> 00:03:53.879 
I'd imagine has something to possibly

00:03:53.879 --> 00:03:56.420 
I'd imagine has something to possibly
with<00:03:54.000> Tartarus<00:03:54.389> or<00:03:54.569> maybe<00:03:55.169> even<00:03:55.470> zero<00:03:56.129> force

00:03:56.420 --> 00:03:56.430 
with Tartarus or maybe even zero force

00:03:56.430 --> 00:03:57.710 
with Tartarus or maybe even zero force
or<00:03:56.669> something<00:03:57.060> like<00:03:57.120> that<00:03:57.209> even<00:03:57.510> though<00:03:57.690> I

00:03:57.710 --> 00:03:57.720 
or something like that even though I

00:03:57.720 --> 00:03:59.599 
or something like that even though I
don't<00:03:57.930> think<00:03:58.079> syrup<00:03:58.590> would<00:03:58.709> necessarily<00:03:58.889> spy

00:03:59.599 --> 00:03:59.609 
don't think syrup would necessarily spy

00:03:59.609 --> 00:04:01.430 
don't think syrup would necessarily spy
from<00:03:59.879> a<00:03:59.970> distance<00:04:00.359> because<00:04:00.599> you<00:04:00.720> just<00:04:01.079> will

00:04:01.430 --> 00:04:01.440 
from a distance because you just will

00:04:01.440 --> 00:04:02.990 
from a distance because you just will
come<00:04:01.650> out<00:04:01.769> and<00:04:01.919> do<00:04:02.010> shit<00:04:02.220> himself<00:04:02.340> so<00:04:02.699> after

00:04:02.990 --> 00:04:03.000 
come out and do shit himself so after

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:04.220
