00:02:00.680 --> 00:02:00.690 
throughout the year and for two

00:02:00.690 --> 00:02:04.850 
throughout the year and for two
different<00:02:00.990> reasons<00:02:02.870> first<00:02:03.870> because<00:02:04.140> of<00:02:04.710> its

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:04.860 
different reasons first because of its

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:07.760 
different reasons first because of its
orbit<00:02:05.280> is<00:02:05.430> an<00:02:05.610> ellipse<00:02:05.970> and<00:02:06.120> not<00:02:06.480> a<00:02:06.510> circle<00:02:07.050> the

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:07.770 
orbit is an ellipse and not a circle the

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:10.070 
orbit is an ellipse and not a circle the
Earth<00:02:07.950> moves<00:02:08.340> faster<00:02:08.940> when<00:02:09.479> it<00:02:09.600> is<00:02:09.720> near<00:02:09.960> the

00:02:10.070 --> 00:02:10.080 
Earth moves faster when it is near the

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:12.950 
Earth moves faster when it is near the
Sun<00:02:10.350> and<00:02:10.649> slower<00:02:11.640> when<00:02:12.270> it<00:02:12.390> is<00:02:12.510> further<00:02:12.870> from

00:02:12.950 --> 00:02:12.960 
Sun and slower when it is further from

00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:16.820 
Sun and slower when it is further from
the<00:02:13.290> Sun<00:02:14.720> so<00:02:15.720> the<00:02:15.870> little<00:02:16.140> extra<00:02:16.560> amount<00:02:16.740> of

00:02:16.820 --> 00:02:16.830 
the Sun so the little extra amount of

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:19.790 
the Sun so the little extra amount of
rotation<00:02:17.459> that<00:02:18.030> the<00:02:18.270> earth<00:02:18.480> needs<00:02:18.780> to<00:02:19.020> do<00:02:19.260> to

00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:19.800 
rotation that the earth needs to do to

00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:22.520 
rotation that the earth needs to do to
get<00:02:19.950> from<00:02:20.160> noon<00:02:20.430> to<00:02:20.640> noon<00:02:21.170> changes<00:02:22.170> throughout

00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:22.530 
get from noon to noon changes throughout

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:27.570 
get from noon to noon changes throughout
the<00:02:22.709> year

00:02:27.570 --> 00:02:27.580 

00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:30.700 

second<00:02:28.580> because<00:02:29.480> the<00:02:29.630> earth<00:02:29.840> is<00:02:30.080> tilted<00:02:30.380> on

00:02:30.700 --> 00:02:30.710 
second because the earth is tilted on

00:02:30.710 --> 00:02:34.000 
second because the earth is tilted on
its<00:02:30.770> axis<00:02:31.240> the<00:02:32.240> little<00:02:32.570> extra<00:02:32.990> rotation<00:02:33.650> to

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:34.010 
its axis the little extra rotation to

00:02:34.010 --> 00:02:36.670 
its axis the little extra rotation to
get<00:02:34.160> from<00:02:34.430> noon<00:02:34.670> to<00:02:34.940> noon<00:02:35.150> is<00:02:35.450> largest<00:02:36.200> at<00:02:36.500> the

00:02:36.670 --> 00:02:36.680 
get from noon to noon is largest at the

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:40.140 
get from noon to noon is largest at the
solstices<00:02:37.400> and<00:02:37.750> smallest<00:02:38.750> at<00:02:38.960> the<00:02:39.080> equinoxes

00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:40.150 
solstices and smallest at the equinoxes

00:02:40.150 --> 00:02:43.600 
solstices and smallest at the equinoxes
so<00:02:41.150> solar<00:02:41.510> days<00:02:41.900> grow<00:02:42.470> progressively<00:02:43.280> longer

00:02:43.600 --> 00:02:43.610
