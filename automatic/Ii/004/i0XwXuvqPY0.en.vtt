Hi it’s Steve from PartSelect.

00:00:01.369 --> 00:00:05.600
Today, we are going to show you how to change
the door gasket on your dishwasher and it’s

00:00:05.600 --> 00:00:06.810
a really easy job.

00:00:06.810 --> 00:00:08.250
You won’t need any tools.

00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:09.880
Let me show you how we do it.

00:00:09.880 --> 00:00:14.929
Now to do this repair, we are going to open
the dishwasher door, and then we will just

00:00:14.929 --> 00:00:24.180
grasp the old gasket in any powder and then
just peel it completely out of the opening.

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:32.500
It’s just a friction fit, and we will set
that aside and we will take the new gasket

00:00:32.500 --> 00:00:35.980
and note the profile of it.

00:00:35.980 --> 00:00:40.840
That will help you orientate which way to
put the gasket in.

00:00:40.840 --> 00:00:45.250
There is a ribbed side that will face towards
the inside of the opening.

00:00:45.250 --> 00:00:52.260
So I will start in one end and inspect all
the way around to make sure that there is

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:53.780
no crud build-up in there.

00:00:53.780 --> 00:00:59.420
You can just take a flat blade screwdriver
and just clean any of that out of there and

00:00:59.420 --> 00:01:04.920
anything that might prevent you from getting
a nice tight flip.

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:20.790
Pay particular attention to the bottom of
the corners and you just push the gasket into

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:38.729
that channel, just loosely to begin with,
and use caution not to pull it or stretch

00:01:38.729 --> 00:01:39.930
it.

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:54.970
They are at pre-cut lengths, so there shouldn’t
be any need to trim any off and tuck the other

00:01:54.970 --> 00:01:56.780
end in.

00:01:56.780 --> 00:02:16.590
Make sure that we haven’t stretched it anywhere,
and then go all the way around until it is

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:38.099
fully seated 

00:02:38.099 --> 00:02:50.989
and check the door closure to make sure that
we have a good fit and our repair is complete.

00:02:50.989 --> 00:02:53.090
I told you it was an easy job.

00:02:53.090 --> 00:02:55.469
Thanks for watching and good luck with your
repair.
