fighting three or fatal fury this one is
very<00:01:06.340> rigid<00:01:06.850> in<00:01:07.299> its<00:01:07.780> gameplay<00:01:08.229> it's<00:01:08.650> a<00:01:08.740> lot

00:01:08.940 --> 00:01:08.950 
very rigid in its gameplay it's a lot

00:01:08.950 --> 00:01:11.480 
very rigid in its gameplay it's a lot
like<00:01:09.130> Mortal<00:01:09.580> Kombat<00:01:10.270> not<00:01:10.570> stylistically

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:11.490 
like Mortal Kombat not stylistically

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:14.370 
like Mortal Kombat not stylistically
they're<00:01:12.490> obviously<00:01:13.090> very<00:01:13.180> very<00:01:13.840> different

00:01:14.370 --> 00:01:14.380 
they're obviously very very different

00:01:14.380 --> 00:01:16.440 
they're obviously very very different
but<00:01:14.799> like<00:01:15.009> Mortal<00:01:15.369> Kombat<00:01:15.790> it's<00:01:15.970> just<00:01:16.270> not

00:01:16.440 --> 00:01:16.450 
but like Mortal Kombat it's just not

00:01:16.450 --> 00:01:18.960
