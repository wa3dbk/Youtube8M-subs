a six frame candle animation by slightly
moving<00:00:27.269> and<00:00:27.449> modifying<00:00:27.960> the<00:00:28.140> flame<00:00:28.470> and

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:28.740 
moving and modifying the flame and

moving and modifying the flame and
illumination<00:00:29.340> layers<00:00:29.580> I<00:00:31.669> can<00:00:32.669> check<00:00:32.850> the

00:00:32.959 --> 00:00:32.969 
illumination layers I can check the

00:00:32.969 --> 00:00:34.850 
illumination layers I can check the
animation<00:00:33.149> in<00:00:33.660> Photoshop<00:00:34.230> and<00:00:34.440> try<00:00:34.829> a

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:34.860 
animation in Photoshop and try a

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:36.470

different<00:00:35.040> background<00:00:35.370> layers<00:00:35.760> to<00:00:36.149> check<00:00:36.329> the

00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:36.480 
different background layers to check the

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:48.440 
different background layers to check the
transparency<00:00:37.170> of<00:00:37.320> my<00:00:37.469> tile<00:00:37.710> set<00:00:47.329> once<00:00:48.329> I've

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:48.450 
transparency of my tile set once I've

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:50.090 
transparency of my tile set once I've
gotten<00:00:48.690> the<00:00:48.780> animation<00:00:49.320> the<00:00:49.440> way<00:00:49.559> I<00:00:49.590> want<00:00:49.950> it

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:50.100 
gotten the animation the way I want it

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:51.290 
gotten the animation the way I want it
I'll<00:00:50.280> make<00:00:50.489> the<00:00:50.610> background<00:00:50.820> layers

00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:51.300 
I'll make the background layers

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:53.479 
I'll make the background layers
invisible<00:00:51.930> so<00:00:52.289> that<00:00:52.469> it<00:00:52.559> will<00:00:52.649> be<00:00:52.800> transparent

00:00:53.479 --> 00:00:53.489 
invisible so that it will be transparent

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:56.600 
invisible so that it will be transparent
and<00:00:53.670> I<00:00:53.910> save<00:00:54.120> each<00:00:54.390> frame<00:00:54.719> as<00:00:54.989> a<00:00:55.050> PNG<00:00:55.530> file<00:00:55.980> but

00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:56.610 
and I save each frame as a PNG file but

00:00:56.610 --> 00:00:59.930 
and I save each frame as a PNG file but
you<00:00:56.730> will<00:00:56.879> have<00:00:57.000> to<00:00:57.149> save<00:00:57.360> as<00:00:57.510> a<00:00:57.600> copy<00:00:58.579> say<00:00:59.579> ok

00:00:59.930 --> 00:00:59.940 
you will have to save as a copy say ok

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:02.119 
you will have to save as a copy say ok
and<00:01:00.210> number<00:01:00.780> each<00:01:00.960> file<00:01:01.289> to<00:01:01.710> match<00:01:01.859> its

00:01:02.119 --> 00:01:02.129 
and number each file to match its

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:16.220 
and number each file to match its
appropriate<00:01:02.670> frame

00:01:16.220 --> 00:01:16.230 

00:01:16.230 --> 00:01:19.230
