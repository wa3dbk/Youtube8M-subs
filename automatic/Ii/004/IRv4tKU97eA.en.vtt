00:01:12.250 --> 00:01:18.200
 she gets ready in 2 minutes 30 seconds 

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:19.630
 I did in 30 seconds because when 

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:28.189
 I do not speak fast enough 

00:01:19.630 --> 00:01:32.600

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:39.640
 pay to make a line there is one to 

00:01:37.369 --> 00:01:39.640
 dish 

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:51.140
 not paradoxical so much so that this is 

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:56.120
 only after I want to show 

00:01:51.140 --> 00:01:58.970
 like that you go the starter pillar 

00:01:56.120 --> 00:02:04.310

00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:28.520
 not until the end until the little trill 

00:02:20.510 --> 00:02:35.900
 gold since little laugh has not there so that 

00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:38.660
 go that aside so that's nacala 

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:43.000
 after that was going to pass as long as you 

00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:46.400

 I use the departures be because 

00:02:52.010 --> 00:02:55.790
 it's easier 

00:02:52.610 --> 00:02:59.420
