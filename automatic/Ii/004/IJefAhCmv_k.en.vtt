00:06:28.140 --> 00:06:28.150 
one would have saw through my

00:06:28.150 --> 00:06:31.230 
one would have saw through my
impenetrable<00:06:28.600> lines<00:06:29.289> of<00:06:29.500> defense<00:06:29.830> if<00:06:30.240> it

00:06:31.230 --> 00:06:31.240 
impenetrable lines of defense if it

00:06:31.240 --> 00:06:33.029 
impenetrable lines of defense if it
weren't<00:06:31.450> for<00:06:31.539> the<00:06:31.750> way<00:06:31.870> that<00:06:32.080> I<00:06:32.110> walked<00:06:32.500> which

00:06:33.029 --> 00:06:33.039 
weren't for the way that I walked which

00:06:33.039 --> 00:06:35.820 
weren't for the way that I walked which
looked<00:06:33.909> looked<00:06:34.330> absolutely<00:06:34.539> nothing<00:06:35.020> like<00:06:35.409> a

00:06:35.820 --> 00:06:35.830 
looked looked absolutely nothing like a

00:06:35.830 --> 00:06:38.480 
looked looked absolutely nothing like a
normal<00:06:36.159> human<00:06:36.280> walk

00:06:38.480 --> 00:06:38.490 
normal human walk

00:06:38.490 --> 00:06:43.170 
normal human walk
it<00:06:39.490> was<00:06:39.640> more<00:06:39.850> like<00:06:39.880> a<00:06:40.110> backwards<00:06:41.110> ass<00:06:42.180> crab

00:06:43.170 --> 00:06:43.180 
it was more like a backwards ass crab

00:06:43.180 --> 00:06:45.810 
it was more like a backwards ass crab
sprint<00:06:44.020> by<00:06:44.380> this<00:06:44.440> time<00:06:44.860> I<00:06:45.130> knew<00:06:45.160> I<00:06:45.340> had<00:06:45.520> already

00:06:45.810 --> 00:06:45.820 
sprint by this time I knew I had already

00:06:45.820 --> 00:06:48.660 
sprint by this time I knew I had already
fucked<00:06:46.240> up<00:06:46.450> bad<00:06:46.960> enough<00:06:47.410> so<00:06:47.830> I<00:06:47.860> just<00:06:48.310> put<00:06:48.520> down

00:06:48.660 --> 00:06:48.670 
fucked up bad enough so I just put down

00:06:48.670 --> 00:06:50.610 
fucked up bad enough so I just put down
the<00:06:48.880> first<00:06:49.060> logical<00:06:49.780> thing<00:06:50.020> on<00:06:50.260> the<00:06:50.380> board

00:06:50.610 --> 00:06:50.620 
the first logical thing on the board

00:06:50.620 --> 00:06:52.770 
the first logical thing on the board
that<00:06:50.830> looked<00:06:51.040> like<00:06:51.130> a<00:06:51.280> number<00:06:51.780> which

00:06:52.770 --> 00:06:52.780 
that looked like a number which

00:06:52.780 --> 00:06:54.330 
that looked like a number which
according<00:06:53.350> to<00:06:53.410> the<00:06:53.560> rest<00:06:53.740> of<00:06:53.860> the<00:06:53.950> students

00:06:54.330 --> 00:06:54.340 
according to the rest of the students

00:06:54.340 --> 00:06:56.100 
according to the rest of the students
look<00:06:54.520> like<00:06:54.700> some<00:06:54.940> type<00:06:55.120> of<00:06:55.150> aborted<00:06:55.600> hybrid

00:06:56.100 --> 00:06:56.110 
look like some type of aborted hybrid

00:06:56.110 --> 00:06:58.680 
look like some type of aborted hybrid
between<00:06:56.260> a<00:06:56.440> 9<00:06:56.650> and<00:06:56.890> a<00:06:56.950> 3<00:06:57.250> I<00:06:57.460> I<00:06:57.580> guess<00:06:58.060> I<00:06:58.210> was<00:06:58.420> so

00:06:58.680 --> 00:06:58.690 
between a 9 and a 3 I I guess I was so

00:06:58.690 --> 00:07:00.540 
between a 9 and a 3 I I guess I was so
caught<00:06:59.110> up<00:06:59.140> in<00:06:59.380> the<00:06:59.470> moment<00:06:59.620> I<00:06:59.920> just<00:06:59.950> ended<00:07:00.490> up

00:07:00.540 --> 00:07:00.550 
caught up in the moment I just ended up

00:07:00.550 --> 00:07:02.250 
caught up in the moment I just ended up
drawing<00:07:00.940> a<00:07:01.150> fucking<00:07:01.510> hieroglyphic<00:07:02.140> or

00:07:02.250 --> 00:07:02.260 
drawing a fucking hieroglyphic or

00:07:02.260 --> 00:07:04.830 
drawing a fucking hieroglyphic or
something<00:07:02.620> and<00:07:02.890> I<00:07:03.070> just<00:07:03.460> I<00:07:03.610> just<00:07:03.760> ran<00:07:04.240> back<00:07:04.480> to

00:07:04.830 --> 00:07:04.840 
something and I just I just ran back to

00:07:04.840 --> 00:07:07.890 
something and I just I just ran back to
my<00:07:04.960> seat<00:07:05.170> as<00:07:05.350> fast<00:07:05.560> as<00:07:05.710> I<00:07:05.800> could<00:07:05.860> I<00:07:06.630> just<00:07:07.630> acted

00:07:07.890 --> 00:07:07.900 
my seat as fast as I could I just acted

00:07:07.900 --> 00:07:08.790 
my seat as fast as I could I just acted
like<00:07:07.930> nothing<00:07:08.200> happened

00:07:08.790 --> 00:07:08.800 
like nothing happened

00:07:08.800 --> 00:07:11.280 
like nothing happened
so<00:07:09.010> I<00:07:09.370> I<00:07:09.460> guess<00:07:09.940> the<00:07:10.090> moral<00:07:10.300> of<00:07:10.390> the<00:07:10.510> story<00:07:10.540> of

00:07:11.280 --> 00:07:11.290 
so I I guess the moral of the story of

00:07:11.290 --> 00:07:15.060 
so I I guess the moral of the story of
what<00:07:11.470> I'm<00:07:11.560> trying<00:07:11.800> to<00:07:11.830> say<00:07:12.040> here<00:07:12.340> is<00:07:14.070> don't

00:07:15.060 --> 00:07:15.070 
what I'm trying to say here is don't

00:07:15.070 --> 00:07:17.880 
what I'm trying to say here is don't
drink<00:07:15.400> chocolate<00:07:15.610> milk
