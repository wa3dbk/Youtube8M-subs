00:00:04.450 --> 00:00:09.160
 chance we will learn how to download 

00:00:06.690 --> 00:00:11.799
 microsoft office professional plus 2010 

00:00:09.160 --> 00:00:14.019
 since in my previous life 

00:00:11.799 --> 00:00:17.260
 all my links were megaupload but 

00:00:14.019 --> 00:00:19.230
 as you know right now in 2012 I 

00:00:17.260 --> 00:00:21.090
 Cloud has died 

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:23.430
 well the first thing we have to do 

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:26.340
 is to go to the links that I will leave in 

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:29.910
 the description of the video since they have 

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:31.949
 downloaded everything all the links are going to 

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:35.309
 where they kept them in my case I already 

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:38.940
 I burned a civilian and he left me 

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:40.980
 all these folders good what 

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:44.370
 you have to do is just give 

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:46.800
 Right click on this icon and you are given 

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:49.920
 run with an administrator in case of 

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:52.350

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:56.480

00:00:53.480 --> 00:00:58.640
 to run as administrator and 

00:00:56.480 --> 00:01:01.700
 we wait 

00:00:58.640 --> 00:01:03.739

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:06.650
 open in the installation window 

00:01:03.739 --> 00:01:09.470
 but since I already have it installed I 

00:01:06.650 --> 00:01:12.070
 gives me the option to repair remove or 

00:01:09.470 --> 00:01:14.560
 write a product key 

00:01:12.070 --> 00:01:16.409
 talking about key product 

00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:19.090
