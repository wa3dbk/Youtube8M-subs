today I'm going to be going over how to

00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:24.909 
today I'm going to be going over how to
use<00:00:23.000> natural<00:00:23.270> materials<00:00:23.990> to<00:00:24.439> make<00:00:24.619> cordage

00:00:24.909 --> 00:00:24.919 
use natural materials to make cordage

00:00:24.919 --> 00:00:27.749 
use natural materials to make cordage
with<00:00:25.250> and<00:00:25.550> this<00:00:26.509> is<00:00:26.570> a<00:00:26.750> very<00:00:27.230> valuable

00:00:27.749 --> 00:00:27.759 
with and this is a very valuable

00:00:27.759 --> 00:00:30.190 
with and this is a very valuable
survival<00:00:28.759> skill<00:00:29.119> you<00:00:29.300> know<00:00:29.419> it's<00:00:29.869> borderline

00:00:30.190 --> 00:00:30.200 
survival skill you know it's borderline

00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:33.130 
survival skill you know it's borderline
primitive<00:00:30.800> survival<00:00:31.480> but<00:00:32.480> you<00:00:32.809> know<00:00:32.930> I<00:00:32.960> think

00:00:33.130 --> 00:00:33.140 
primitive survival but you know I think

00:00:33.140 --> 00:00:34.930 
primitive survival but you know I think
also<00:00:33.620> modern<00:00:33.980> survivalist<00:00:34.580> should<00:00:34.699> know<00:00:34.790> how

00:00:34.930 --> 00:00:34.940 
also modern survivalist should know how

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:36.880 
also modern survivalist should know how
to<00:00:35.000> do<00:00:35.180> it<00:00:35.269> as<00:00:35.390> well<00:00:35.540> just<00:00:35.600> because<00:00:36.019> cordage<00:00:36.710> is

00:00:36.880 --> 00:00:36.890 
to do it as well just because cordage is

00:00:36.890 --> 00:00:39.400 
to do it as well just because cordage is

off<00:01:57.680> you<00:01:57.979> know<00:01:58.100> when<00:01:58.219> you're<00:01:58.340> using<00:01:58.520> some<00:01:58.850> kind

00:01:58.929 --> 00:01:58.939 
off you know when you're using some kind

00:01:58.939 --> 00:02:00.340 
off you know when you're using some kind
of<00:01:59.060> bark<00:01:59.299> like<00:01:59.509> this<00:01:59.570> you're<00:01:59.990> going<00:02:00.110> to<00:02:00.200> want

00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:00.350 
of bark like this you're going to want

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:02.440 
of bark like this you're going to want
it<00:02:00.469> you<00:02:00.890> know<00:02:01.070> somewhat<00:02:01.549> wet<00:02:01.820> so<00:02:02.180> just<00:02:02.360> you

00:02:02.440 --> 00:02:02.450 
it you know somewhat wet so just you

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:04.030 
it you know somewhat wet so just you
know<00:02:02.540> damp<00:02:02.899> it<00:02:03.079> up<00:02:03.200> just<00:02:03.380> to<00:02:03.500> make<00:02:03.680> it<00:02:03.829> workable

00:02:04.030 --> 00:02:04.040 
know damp it up just to make it workable

00:02:04.040 --> 00:02:07.990 
know damp it up just to make it workable
and<00:02:05.079> then<00:02:06.079> uh<00:02:06.159> this<00:02:07.159> is<00:02:07.340> like<00:02:07.490> I<00:02:07.579> said<00:02:07.759> this<00:02:07.850> is

00:02:07.990 --> 00:02:08.000 
and then uh this is like I said this is

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:10.990 
and then uh this is like I said this is
tulip<00:02:08.299> poplar<00:02:08.660> bark<00:02:09.489> you<00:02:10.489> just<00:02:10.670> want<00:02:10.789> to<00:02:10.850> kind

00:02:10.990 --> 00:02:11.000 
tulip poplar bark you just want to kind

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:13.720 
tulip poplar bark you just want to kind
of<00:02:11.120> get<00:02:11.299> it<00:02:11.420> good<00:02:11.720> and<00:02:11.780> wet<00:02:12.140> or<00:02:12.530> damp<00:02:13.280> I<00:02:13.519> should

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:13.730 
of get it good and wet or damp I should

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:17.640 
of get it good and wet or damp I should
say<00:02:14.140> you<00:02:15.140> don't<00:02:15.260> want<00:02:15.470> it<00:02:15.560> really<00:02:15.709> soaking

00:06:32.700 --> 00:06:32.710 
it into to give it that strength so you

00:06:32.710 --> 00:06:34.980 
it into to give it that strength so you
can<00:06:33.010> see<00:06:33.250> my<00:06:33.760> new<00:06:33.940> quarter<00:06:34.360> starts<00:06:34.659> from
