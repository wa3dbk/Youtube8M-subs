00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:41.640 
turn by rotating or open and then she's

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:43.490 
turn by rotating or open and then she's
gonna<00:01:41.759> take<00:01:41.970> four<00:01:42.360> steps<00:01:42.630> during<00:01:43.110> the<00:01:43.229> turn

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:43.500 
gonna take four steps during the turn

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:45.260 
gonna take four steps during the turn
not<00:01:44.070> counting<00:01:44.250> the<00:01:44.460> rock<00:01:44.700> steps<00:01:45.000> so<00:01:45.149> we're

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:45.270 
not counting the rock steps so we're

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:49.069 
not counting the rock steps so we're
gonna<00:01:45.360> go<00:01:45.540> rock<00:01:46.320> step<00:01:46.649> turn<00:01:47.460> turn<00:01:48.119> turn<00:01:48.479> and

00:01:49.069 --> 00:01:49.079 
gonna go rock step turn turn turn and

00:01:49.079 --> 00:01:50.539 
gonna go rock step turn turn turn and
step<00:01:49.350> back<00:01:49.560> at<00:01:49.799> the<00:01:49.890> end<00:01:50.070> to<00:01:50.250> kill<00:01:50.460> the

00:01:50.539 --> 00:01:50.549 
step back at the end to kill the

00:01:50.549 --> 00:01:52.580 
step back at the end to kill the
momentum<00:01:50.790> okay<00:01:51.659> so<00:01:51.720> she's<00:01:52.049> just<00:01:52.229> gonna<00:01:52.380> take

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:52.590 
momentum okay so she's just gonna take

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:54.469 
momentum okay so she's just gonna take
four<00:01:52.829> this<00:01:52.950> time<00:01:53.009> she's<00:01:53.700> gonna<00:01:53.820> keep<00:01:53.970> it<00:01:54.149> focus

00:01:54.469 --> 00:01:54.479 
four this time she's gonna keep it focus

00:01:54.479 --> 00:01:55.730 
four this time she's gonna keep it focus
on<00:01:54.600> you<00:01:54.750> which<00:01:54.899> will<00:01:54.990> help<00:01:55.110> her<00:01:55.259> not<00:01:55.409> over

on you which will help her not over

00:01:55.740 --> 00:02:01.730 
on you which will help her not over
rotate<00:01:56.130> in<00:01:56.340> one<00:01:56.930> two<00:01:57.930> three<00:01:58.649> four<00:01:59.689> one<00:02:00.689> two<00:02:01.170> one

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:07.280 
rotate in one two three four one two one
two<00:02:02.040> three<00:02:02.579> four<00:02:03.420> okay<00:02:05.780> so<00:02:06.780> at<00:02:06.930> the<00:02:07.020> beginning

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:07.290 
two three four okay so at the beginning

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:08.719 
two three four okay so at the beginning
you<00:02:07.439> might<00:02:07.500> over<00:02:07.829> rotate<00:02:08.129> you<00:02:08.250> might<00:02:08.429> take<00:02:08.580> two

00:02:08.719 --> 00:02:08.729 
you might over rotate you might take two

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:10.070 
you might over rotate you might take two
bigger<00:02:08.940> steps<00:02:09.149> that's<00:02:09.390> all<00:02:09.539> common<00:02:09.959> and

00:02:10.070 --> 00:02:10.080 
bigger steps that's all common and

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:10.400 
bigger steps that's all common and
normal

00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:10.410

arms around so that was really good okay
you<00:02:18.900> came<00:02:19.050> out<00:02:19.140> looking<00:02:19.379> at<00:02:19.500> me<00:02:19.590> again<00:02:19.680> the

00:02:20.449 --> 00:02:20.459 
you came out looking at me again the

00:02:20.459 --> 00:02:22.940 
you came out looking at me again the
second<00:02:20.760> place<00:02:20.910> that<00:02:21.090> we<00:02:21.209> use<00:02:21.360> that<00:02:21.569> is<00:02:22.530> any

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:22.950 
second place that we use that is any

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:25.729 
second place that we use that is any
time<00:02:22.980> I<00:02:23.370> let<00:02:23.610> her<00:02:23.879> go<00:02:24.120> in<00:02:24.510> a<00:02:24.959> free<00:02:25.230> spin<00:02:25.530> which

00:02:25.729 --> 00:02:25.739 
time I let her go in a free spin which

00:02:25.739 --> 00:02:27.559 
time I let her go in a free spin which
means<00:02:25.950> not<00:02:26.129> touching<00:02:26.550> she<00:02:27.090> does<00:02:27.270> those<00:02:27.540> two

00:02:27.559 --> 00:02:27.569 
means not touching she does those two

00:02:27.569 --> 00:02:29.710 
means not touching she does those two
terms<00:02:28.080> now<00:02:28.290> this<00:02:28.530> time<00:02:28.709> she's<00:02:28.920> going<00:02:29.069> to<00:02:29.190> turn

00:02:29.710 --> 00:02:29.720 
terms now this time she's going to turn

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:33.050 
terms now this time she's going to turn
to<00:02:30.720> her<00:02:30.840> left<00:02:31.140> as<00:02:31.440> well<00:02:31.739> so<00:02:32.340> he<00:02:32.580> or<00:02:32.640> she's<00:02:32.849> gonna

00:02:36.949 --> 00:02:36.959 
go one two in a turn turn turn and then

00:02:36.959 --> 00:02:38.300

00:02:51.209 --> 00:02:52.910 
you can see Lisa did the Genie pose in
the<00:02:51.269> middle<00:02:51.510> which<00:02:51.690> is<00:02:51.720> great<00:02:52.050> another<00:02:52.650> part

00:02:52.910 --> 00:02:52.920 
the middle which is great another part

00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:54.199 
the middle which is great another part
that<00:02:53.040> we<00:02:53.160> wanted<00:02:53.430> to<00:02:53.489> make<00:02:53.730> sure<00:02:53.760> that<00:02:53.940> we

00:02:54.199 --> 00:02:54.209 
that we wanted to make sure that we

00:02:54.209 --> 00:02:55.790 
that we wanted to make sure that we
included<00:02:54.540> in<00:02:54.629> here<00:02:54.810> it's<00:02:55.200> getting<00:02:55.349> back<00:02:55.650> at

00:02:55.790 --> 00:02:55.800 
included in here it's getting back at

00:02:55.800 --> 00:02:57.259 
included in here it's getting back at
the<00:02:55.860> closed<00:02:56.069> position<00:02:56.250> so<00:02:56.760> when<00:02:56.970> the<00:02:57.060> leader

00:02:57.259 --> 00:02:57.269 
the closed position so when the leader

00:02:57.269 --> 00:02:59.869 
the closed position so when the leader
puts<00:02:57.510> his<00:02:57.629> hand<00:02:57.870> on<00:02:58.110> the<00:02:58.530> back<00:02:58.860> of<00:02:59.069> your<00:02:59.190> back

00:02:59.869 --> 00:02:59.879 
puts his hand on the back of your back

00:02:59.879 --> 00:03:02.420 
puts his hand on the back of your back
on<00:03:00.540> the<00:03:00.659> back<00:03:00.810> your<00:03:01.050> back<00:03:01.260> that's<00:03:02.069> your<00:03:02.220> clue

00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:02.430 
on the back your back that's your clue

00:03:02.430 --> 00:03:03.619 
on the back your back that's your clue
that<00:03:02.610> would<00:03:02.700> want<00:03:02.879> to<00:03:02.940> go<00:03:03.030> to<00:03:03.060> closed<00:03:03.269> position

00:03:03.619 --> 00:03:03.629 
that would want to go to closed position

00:03:03.629 --> 00:03:05.570 
that would want to go to closed position
so<00:03:03.780> you<00:03:03.870> can<00:03:03.900> start<00:03:04.230> to<00:03:04.409> raise<00:03:04.950> the<00:03:05.129> hand<00:03:05.400> up

00:03:05.570 --> 00:03:05.580 
so you can start to raise the hand up

00:03:05.580 --> 00:03:07.850 
so you can start to raise the hand up
right<00:03:05.879> you<00:03:06.750> can<00:03:06.840> turn<00:03:07.050> right<00:03:07.319> in<00:03:07.440> there<00:03:07.620> right

00:03:07.850 --> 00:03:07.860 
right you can turn right in there right

00:03:07.860 --> 00:03:10.040 
right you can turn right in there right
ideally<00:03:08.670> she'll<00:03:08.909> raise<00:03:09.120> the<00:03:09.300> elbow<00:03:09.629> up<00:03:09.810> first

00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:10.050 
ideally she'll raise the elbow up first

00:03:10.050 --> 00:03:13.660 
ideally she'll raise the elbow up first
and<00:03:10.349> then

00:03:13.660 --> 00:03:13.670 

00:03:13.670 --> 00:03:15.430 

so<00:03:14.209> that<00:03:14.540> looks<00:03:14.750> like<00:03:14.810> this<00:03:15.020> one<00:03:15.260> we<00:03:15.350> were
