this is anybody know why does anybody
know<00:00:21.029> why<00:00:21.210> some<00:00:21.539> people<00:00:27.890> go<00:00:28.890> guys<00:00:29.160> who<00:00:29.400> have

00:00:29.540 --> 00:00:29.550 
know why some people go guys who have

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:34.370 
know why some people go guys who have
inks<00:00:30.060> we<00:00:30.420> got<00:00:30.630> what<00:00:32.000> dyes<00:00:33.000> and<00:00:33.510> blues<00:00:33.809> anything

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:34.380 
inks we got what dyes and blues anything

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:38.420 
inks we got what dyes and blues anything
else<00:00:36.230> so<00:00:37.230> it<00:00:37.320> turns<00:00:37.590> out<00:00:37.860> that<00:00:37.920> in<00:00:38.190> order<00:00:38.399> to

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:38.430 
else so it turns out that in order to

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:40.389 
else so it turns out that in order to
make<00:00:38.640> paper<00:00:38.879> there's<00:00:39.180> two<00:00:39.390> processes<00:00:40.110> and

00:00:40.389 --> 00:00:40.399 
make paper there's two processes and

00:00:40.399 --> 00:00:42.530 
make paper there's two processes and
basically<00:00:41.399> cardboard<00:00:41.969> is<00:00:42.059> nothing<00:00:42.390> but

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:42.540 
basically cardboard is nothing but

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:45.260 
basically cardboard is nothing but
layers<00:00:43.350> layers<00:00:43.680> of<00:00:43.800> paper<00:00:43.980> this<00:00:44.190> way<00:00:44.430> and<00:00:44.760> then

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:45.270 
layers layers of paper this way and then

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:47.090 
layers layers of paper this way and then
more<00:00:45.510> layers<00:00:45.719> layer<00:00:45.989> it<00:00:46.140> this<00:00:46.260> way<00:00:46.500> and<00:00:46.739> then

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:47.100 
more layers layer it this way and then

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:49.250 
more layers layer it this way and then
the<00:00:47.250> corrugation<00:00:47.940> going<00:00:48.120> like<00:00:48.329> this<00:00:48.600> and<00:00:48.870> then

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:49.260 
the corrugation going like this and then

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:51.950 
the corrugation going like this and then
they're<00:00:49.410> glued<00:00:49.649> together<00:00:50.660> there's<00:00:51.660> two<00:00:51.809> ways

00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:51.960 
they're glued together there's two ways

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:55.100 
they're glued together there's two ways
of<00:00:52.140> ink<00:00:52.350> paper<00:00:53.270> there's<00:00:54.270> a<00:00:54.360> mechanical<00:00:54.660> wave

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:55.110 
of ink paper there's a mechanical wave

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:57.650 
of ink paper there's a mechanical wave
which<00:00:55.350> is<00:00:55.559> fairly<00:00:56.309> organic<00:00:56.940> they<00:00:57.480> don't

00:00:57.650 --> 00:00:57.660 
which is fairly organic they don't

00:00:57.660 --> 00:00:59.180 
which is fairly organic they don't
really<00:00:57.750> add<00:00:58.020> a<00:00:58.050> lot<00:00:58.230> to<00:00:58.379> it<00:00:58.620> the<00:00:58.739> lateness<00:00:59.010> of

00:00:59.180 --> 00:00:59.190 
really add a lot to it the lateness of

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:01.490 
really add a lot to it the lateness of
the<00:00:59.430> would<00:00:59.730> break<00:01:00.000> down<00:01:00.210> that<00:01:00.989> bond

00:01:01.490 --> 00:01:01.500 
the would break down that bond

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:03.170 
the would break down that bond
everything<00:01:01.829> to<00:01:01.949> get<00:01:02.129> in<00:01:02.280> the<00:01:02.370> school<00:01:02.430> but<00:01:03.090> the

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:03.180 
everything to get in the school but the

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:05.509 
everything to get in the school but the

00:01:05.509 --> 00:01:05.519 
more common light is a chemical process

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:08.810 
more common light is a chemical process

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:08.820 
to get the lightness the most chemicals

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:11.060 
to get the lightness the most chemicals
are<00:01:08.970> a<00:01:09.000> little<00:01:09.150> bit<00:01:09.360> spoon<00:01:09.659> some<00:01:10.500> qualities<00:01:11.040> of

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:11.070 
are a little bit spoon some qualities of

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:19.510 
are a little bit spoon some qualities of
papers<00:01:11.640> are<00:01:12.180> like<00:01:12.390> a<00:01:12.500> higher<00:01:13.700> quality<00:01:14.700> and

00:01:19.510 --> 00:01:19.520 

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:22.810 

then<00:01:20.520> with<00:01:21.210> the<00:01:21.600> cardboard

00:01:22.810 --> 00:01:22.820 
then with the cardboard

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:24.760 
then with the cardboard
got<00:01:23.030> your<00:01:23.210> corrugation<00:01:23.900> there<00:01:24.170> and<00:01:24.470> there's<00:01:24.650> a

00:01:24.760 --> 00:01:24.770 
got your corrugation there and there's a

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:27.160 
got your corrugation there and there's a
blue<00:01:24.950> line<00:01:24.979> but<00:01:25.460> a<00:01:25.490> blue<00:01:25.850> is<00:01:26.270> mostly

00:01:27.160 --> 00:01:27.170 
blue line but a blue is mostly

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:32.740 
blue line but a blue is mostly
cornstarch<00:01:28.210> so<00:01:29.210> thinking<00:01:29.659> oh<00:01:29.900> well<00:01:30.350> that<00:01:31.750> for

00:01:32.740 --> 00:01:32.750 
cornstarch so thinking oh well that for

00:01:32.750 --> 00:01:34.840 
cornstarch so thinking oh well that for
its<00:01:32.960> GMO<00:01:33.560> base<00:01:33.770> but<00:01:34.040> sorry<00:01:34.280> but<00:01:34.729> that's

00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:34.850 
its GMO base but sorry but that's

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:36.790 
its GMO base but sorry but that's
freedom<00:01:35.120> on<00:01:35.570> top<00:01:35.810> real<00:01:36.110> problem<00:01:36.440> is<00:01:36.560> is<00:01:36.770> that

00:01:36.790 --> 00:01:36.800 
freedom on top real problem is is that

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:46.690 
freedom on top real problem is is that
it's<00:01:37.220> not<00:01:37.460> only<00:01:37.690> cornstarch<00:01:43.479> so<00:01:45.520> then<00:01:46.520> there's

00:01:46.690 --> 00:01:46.700 
it's not only cornstarch so then there's

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:48.310 
it's not only cornstarch so then there's
all<00:01:46.850> the<00:01:46.970> tapes<00:01:47.270> that<00:01:47.509> we<00:01:47.660> usually<00:01:47.780> start<00:01:48.170> on

00:01:48.310 --> 00:01:48.320 
all the tapes that we usually start on

00:01:48.320 --> 00:01:49.660 
all the tapes that we usually start on
the<00:01:48.380> park<00:01:48.680> board<00:01:48.830> so<00:01:48.950> a<00:01:49.100> lot<00:01:49.280> of<00:01:49.310> people<00:01:49.400> be

00:01:49.660 --> 00:01:49.670 
the park board so a lot of people be

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:52.510 
the park board so a lot of people be
like<00:01:49.850> peeling<00:01:50.780> off<00:01:51.110> all<00:01:51.350> this<00:01:51.590> tape<00:01:51.979> and<00:01:52.220> stuff

00:01:52.510 --> 00:01:52.520 
like peeling off all this tape and stuff

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:53.980 
like peeling off all this tape and stuff
in<00:01:52.700> order<00:01:52.820> to<00:01:52.940> be<00:01:53.000> able<00:01:53.090> to<00:01:53.180> use<00:01:53.360> the<00:01:53.509> cardboard

00:01:53.980 --> 00:01:53.990 
in order to be able to use the cardboard

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:56.320 
in order to be able to use the cardboard
to<00:01:54.500> make<00:01:54.530> different<00:01:55.039> kinds<00:01:55.280> of<00:01:55.340> racism<00:01:55.940> but<00:01:56.090> it

00:01:56.320 --> 00:01:56.330 
to make different kinds of racism but it

00:01:56.330 --> 00:01:58.029 
to make different kinds of racism but it
gets

00:01:58.029 --> 00:01:58.039

00:02:04.480 --> 00:02:04.490 
big people in the permaculture world

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:07.389 
big people in the permaculture world
there<00:02:05.090> they're<00:02:05.630> happy<00:02:06.140> to<00:02:06.380> use<00:02:06.560> cardboard<00:02:07.100> and

00:02:07.389 --> 00:02:07.399 
there they're happy to use cardboard and

00:02:07.399 --> 00:02:09.940 
there they're happy to use cardboard and
paper<00:02:07.550> newspaper<00:02:08.239> as<00:02:08.899> part<00:02:09.200> of<00:02:09.229> this<00:02:09.320> I<00:02:09.560> have

00:02:09.940 --> 00:02:09.950 
paper newspaper as part of this I have

00:02:09.950 --> 00:02:12.520 
paper newspaper as part of this I have
been<00:02:10.009> to<00:02:10.340> sites<00:02:10.580> where<00:02:11.270> sometimes<00:02:12.140> like<00:02:12.380> all

00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:12.530 
been to sites where sometimes like all

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:13.960 
been to sites where sometimes like all
this<00:02:12.680> tree<00:02:12.920> is<00:02:13.070> really<00:02:13.100> sick<00:02:13.520> I<00:02:13.640> don't<00:02:13.700> know

00:02:13.960 --> 00:02:13.970 
this tree is really sick I don't know

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:15.670 
this tree is really sick I don't know
why<00:02:14.180> and<00:02:14.510> I'm<00:02:14.570> looking<00:02:14.870> at<00:02:14.989> it<00:02:15.080> I<00:02:15.170> think<00:02:15.230> it

00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:15.680 
why and I'm looking at it I think it

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:16.830 
why and I'm looking at it I think it
seems<00:02:15.860> like<00:02:16.010> it's<00:02:16.130> not<00:02:16.250> getting<00:02:16.459> enough<00:02:16.550> water

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:16.840 
seems like it's not getting enough water
