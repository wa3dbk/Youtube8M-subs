I<00:03:21.330> think<00:03:21.870> it's<00:03:22.019> almost<00:03:22.320> a<00:03:22.739> little<00:03:22.799> bit<00:03:23.489> like<00:03:23.610> a

00:03:23.720 --> 00:03:23.730 
I think it's almost a little bit like a

00:03:23.730 --> 00:03:27.140 
I think it's almost a little bit like a
smidge<00:03:24.290> lighter<00:03:25.290> then<00:03:26.100> the<00:03:26.519> prep<00:03:26.730> and<00:03:26.940> prime

00:03:27.140 --> 00:03:27.150 
smidge lighter then the prep and prime

00:03:27.150 --> 00:03:28.400 
smidge lighter then the prep and prime
but<00:03:27.450> it<00:03:27.600> just<00:03:27.870> works

00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:28.410 
but it just works

00:03:28.410 --> 00:03:31.630 
but it just works
so<00:03:28.860> so<00:03:29.130> well<00:03:29.400> in<00:03:29.640> my<00:03:29.790> favor<00:03:30.150> if<00:03:30.600> you<00:03:31.110> are

so so well in my favor if you are

00:03:31.640 --> 00:03:34.610 
so so well in my favor if you are
towards<00:03:32.640> the<00:03:32.820> lighter<00:03:33.180> end<00:03:33.540> of<00:03:33.870> the<00:03:34.380> color

00:03:34.610 --> 00:03:34.620 
towards the lighter end of the color

00:03:34.620 --> 00:03:37.100 
towards the lighter end of the color
spectrum<00:03:34.950> I'm<00:03:35.489> not<00:03:35.850> exactly<00:03:36.269> sure<00:03:36.480> if<00:03:36.930> you'll

00:03:37.100 --> 00:03:37.110
