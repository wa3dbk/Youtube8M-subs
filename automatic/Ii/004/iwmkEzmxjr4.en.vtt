00:00:01.829 --> 00:00:03.340
 The new enforcement rights 

00:00:03.340 --> 00:00:06.340
 In recent years, 

00:00:07.050 --> 00:00:10.159
 There are a few ways to stand out from the inconvenience 

00:00:10.159 --> 00:00:12.819
 I will explain. 

00:00:12.819 --> 00:00:16.769
 For example, Abu Takahada 

00:00:16.769 --> 00:00:20.339
 I have not been blessed since then. 

00:00:20.969 --> 00:00:23.210
 It's a setting. 

00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:27.060
 We do not have a confrontation situation. 

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:29.960
 Buried marker or vip and target 

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:33.020
 When you do that you have to take your opponent's mistake to draw on the floor 

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:34.330
 When you bring 

00:00:34.330 --> 00:00:35.770
 Move 

00:00:35.770 --> 00:00:38.780
 So that it falls to the floor and 

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:40.990
 There are not many prospects. In this case 

00:00:40.990 --> 00:00:44.730
 Enter the option setting and enter the direction setting. 

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:47.730
 Would you like to receive Glavine on the left 

00:00:48.520 --> 00:00:51.040
 But this option 

00:00:51.040 --> 00:00:54.440
 However, if you are normally moving with full back to the left 

00:00:54.440 --> 00:00:55.880
 The back side 

00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:58.930
 Hamlet setting up tax chamber lending growth 

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:03.190
 I can not just leave it like that, 

00:01:03.190 --> 00:01:03.989
 However, 

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:07.440
 At the same time, 

00:01:07.440 --> 00:01:10.420
 Triple punishment 

00:01:10.420 --> 00:01:11.200
 Have 

00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:14.670
 Or maybe you have more than Chocolate. Pull it out again 

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:18.130
 The game being so stylish as to draw us 

00:01:18.130 --> 00:01:20.900
 While playing, the sovereignty mistakenly lit from the light 

00:01:20.900 --> 00:01:23.070
 Do you have to move forward? 

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:26.070
 To prevent this from happening 

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:30.430
 Preferences 

00:01:30.430 --> 00:01:33.150
 Basically there is a paper left click on the mouse 

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:35.230
 Parasitic attack and execution 

00:01:35.230 --> 00:01:38.450
 I want you to turn this off. 

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:41.950
 Market &amp; Trends No matter how many times we double-click to improve 

00:01:45.010 --> 00:01:49.600
 When there are no natural problems, I can easily find them and make mistakes 

00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:51.260
 Falling 

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:53.250
 Can I get away with the situation? 

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:54.750
 Contrary 

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:57.780
 When each of us hit the pole of the left goal 

00:01:57.780 --> 00:02:01.180
 I stand, but there are those who love it. 

00:02:01.180 --> 00:02:04.990
 Mouse left click to attack Click to put the bow 

00:02:04.990 --> 00:02:07.400
 You can prove it as if you let it go. 

00:02:07.400 --> 00:02:09.829
 Press gerald. 

00:02:09.829 --> 00:02:11.249
 this time 

00:02:11.249 --> 00:02:14.349
 Unlike anything else, if you click 

00:02:14.349 --> 00:02:17.189
 Place a click with a right click 

00:02:17.189 --> 00:02:19.919
 Is it 

00:02:19.919 --> 00:02:22.169
 Slightly uncomfortable 

00:02:22.169 --> 00:02:26.209
 Even though there is a tough point because this message comes out, 

00:02:26.209 --> 00:02:28.339
 If you do not move, 3.27
