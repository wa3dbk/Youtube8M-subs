alright<00:00:01.810> hey<00:00:01.930> everyone<00:00:02.379> i'm<00:00:02.590> just

00:00:03.890 --> 00:00:03.900 
alright hey everyone i'm just

00:00:03.900 --> 00:00:06.720 
alright hey everyone i'm just
experimenting<00:00:04.900> with<00:00:05.410> my<00:00:05.770> little<00:00:06.160> stirling

00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:06.730 
experimenting with my little stirling

00:00:06.730 --> 00:00:09.030 
experimenting with my little stirling
engine<00:00:07.300> it's<00:00:07.840> been<00:00:07.990> a<00:00:08.019> while<00:00:08.230> since<00:00:08.499> I<00:00:08.740> played

00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:09.040 
engine it's been a while since I played

00:00:09.040 --> 00:00:11.489 
engine it's been a while since I played
with<00:00:09.519> that<00:00:09.700> little<00:00:10.480> more<00:00:10.719> but<00:00:11.049> it's<00:00:11.169> a<00:00:11.320> neat

00:00:11.489 --> 00:00:11.499 
with that little more but it's a neat

00:00:11.499 --> 00:00:14.180 
with that little more but it's a neat
little<00:00:12.099> more<00:00:12.370> that<00:00:12.579> I've<00:00:12.700> ordered<00:00:12.910> from<00:00:13.360> ebay

00:00:14.180 --> 00:00:14.190 
little more that I've ordered from ebay

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:18.269 
little more that I've ordered from ebay
last<00:00:15.190> year<00:00:15.700> and<00:00:16.109> the<00:00:17.109> interesting<00:00:17.710> part<00:00:17.920> it<00:00:18.099> it

00:00:18.269 --> 00:00:18.279 
last year and the interesting part it it

00:00:18.279 --> 00:00:20.730 
last year and the interesting part it it
has<00:00:18.460> a<00:00:18.490> little<00:00:18.730> DC<00:00:19.509> motor<00:00:19.750> which<00:00:20.080> actually<00:00:20.289> act

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:20.740 
has a little DC motor which actually act

00:00:20.740 --> 00:00:23.970 
has a little DC motor which actually act
act<00:00:21.099> like<00:00:21.580> a<00:00:21.609> generator<00:00:22.390> so<00:00:23.170> it<00:00:23.619> has<00:00:23.650> an

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:23.980 
act like a generator so it has an

00:00:23.980 --> 00:00:28.380 
act like a generator so it has an
internal<00:00:24.810> RGB<00:00:25.810> LED<00:00:26.230> which<00:00:26.470> phase<00:00:27.070> and<00:00:27.490> stuff

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:28.390 
internal RGB LED which phase and stuff

00:00:28.390 --> 00:00:30.329 
internal RGB LED which phase and stuff
like<00:00:28.539> that<00:00:28.599> but<00:00:28.779> that's<00:00:29.410> not<00:00:29.769> the<00:00:30.039> interesting

00:00:30.329 --> 00:00:30.339 
like that but that's not the interesting

00:00:30.339 --> 00:00:33.029 
like that but that's not the interesting
part<00:00:30.730> what<00:00:31.720> I'm<00:00:31.810> actually<00:00:31.990> interested<00:00:32.379> it's

00:00:33.029 --> 00:00:33.039 
part what I'm actually interested it's

00:00:33.039 --> 00:00:35.779 
part what I'm actually interested it's
in<00:00:33.250> the<00:00:33.520> generating<00:00:34.180> part<00:00:34.420> and<00:00:34.660> here<00:00:35.289> you<00:00:35.469> see

00:00:35.779 --> 00:00:35.789 
in the generating part and here you see

00:00:35.789 --> 00:00:39.240 
in the generating part and here you see
the<00:00:36.789> voltage<00:00:37.149> will<00:00:37.719> vary<00:00:38.170> according<00:00:38.980> to<00:00:39.010> the

00:00:39.240 --> 00:00:39.250 
the voltage will vary according to the

00:00:39.250 --> 00:00:42.869 
the voltage will vary according to the
speed<00:00:39.969> of<00:00:40.120> the<00:00:40.149> engine<00:00:40.690> so<00:00:41.500> no<00:00:42.010> load<00:00:42.280> I<00:00:42.550> have

00:00:42.869 --> 00:00:42.879 
speed of the engine so no load I have

00:00:42.879 --> 00:00:45.900 
speed of the engine so no load I have
three<00:00:43.300> point<00:00:43.660> four<00:00:44.469> three<00:00:45.219> point<00:00:45.460> three<00:00:45.550> nine

00:00:45.900 --> 00:00:45.910 
three point four three point three nine

00:00:45.910 --> 00:00:50.010 
three point four three point three nine
volts<00:00:46.690> here<00:00:46.989> and<00:00:47.850> this<00:00:48.850> is<00:00:48.910> a<00:00:49.120> little<00:00:49.359> circuit

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:50.020 
volts here and this is a little circuit

00:00:50.020 --> 00:00:51.720 
volts here and this is a little circuit
that<00:00:50.140> I've<00:00:50.260> been<00:00:50.410> playing<00:00:50.710> around<00:00:51.039> here<00:00:51.489> it's

00:00:51.720 --> 00:00:51.730 
that I've been playing around here it's

00:00:51.730 --> 00:00:54.720 
that I've been playing around here it's
quite<00:00:52.690> popular<00:00:53.260> on<00:00:53.680> the<00:00:53.800> internet<00:00:54.340> and

00:00:54.720 --> 00:00:54.730 
quite popular on the internet and

00:00:54.730 --> 00:00:57.090 
quite popular on the internet and
actually<00:00:55.660> for<00:00:55.899> those<00:00:56.050> who<00:00:56.320> actually<00:00:56.590> want<00:00:57.010> to

00:00:57.090 --> 00:00:57.100 
actually for those who actually want to

00:00:57.100 --> 00:00:59.549 
actually for those who actually want to
see<00:00:57.430> the<00:00:57.579> schematic<00:00:58.120> let<00:00:58.629> me<00:00:58.929> pull<00:00:59.289> it<00:00:59.410> out

00:00:59.549 --> 00:00:59.559 
see the schematic let me pull it out

00:00:59.559 --> 00:01:07.020 
see the schematic let me pull it out
here

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:07.030 

00:01:07.030 --> 00:01:12.630 

it<00:01:07.510> is<00:01:07.720> actually<00:01:08.020> this<00:01:08.650> one<00:01:09.990> the<00:01:10.990> value<00:01:11.470> of<00:01:11.979> the

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:12.640 
it is actually this one the value of the

00:01:12.640 --> 00:01:16.170 
it is actually this one the value of the
capacitor<00:01:13.500> right<00:01:14.500> here<00:01:14.799> is<00:01:15.010> not<00:01:15.250> correct<00:01:15.700> I'm

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:16.180 
capacitor right here is not correct I'm

00:01:16.180 --> 00:01:22.620 
capacitor right here is not correct I'm
actually<00:01:16.450> using<00:01:16.990> a<00:01:18.600> 151<00:01:20.220> pico<00:01:21.220> farad<00:01:21.700> the

00:01:22.620 --> 00:01:22.630 
actually using a 151 pico farad the

00:01:22.630 --> 00:01:25.560 
actually using a 151 pico farad the
resistor<00:01:23.320> and<00:01:23.490> stuff<00:01:24.490> like<00:01:24.670> that<00:01:24.729> or<00:01:25.090> actually

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:25.570 
resistor and stuff like that or actually

00:01:25.570 --> 00:01:28.680 
resistor and stuff like that or actually
the<00:01:26.470> resistor<00:01:27.250> here<00:01:27.460> is<00:01:27.640> not<00:01:27.850> correct<00:01:28.210> i<00:01:28.450> use

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:28.690 
the resistor here is not correct i use

00:01:28.690 --> 00:01:32.520 
the resistor here is not correct i use
an<00:01:28.869> LED<00:01:29.020> for<00:01:29.649> voltage<00:01:30.220> regulating<00:01:30.880> and<00:01:31.530> but

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:32.530 
an LED for voltage regulating and but

00:01:32.530 --> 00:01:41.969 
an LED for voltage regulating and but
you<00:01:33.460> basically<00:01:33.940> get<00:01:34.240> the<00:01:34.420> idea<00:01:35.430> and<00:01:40.830> here<00:01:41.830> is

00:01:41.969 --> 00:01:41.979 
you basically get the idea and here is

00:01:41.979 --> 00:01:44.639 
you basically get the idea and here is
the<00:01:42.190> circuit<00:01:42.630> working<00:01:43.630> of<00:01:43.780> course<00:01:43.810> under<00:01:44.470> load

00:01:44.639 --> 00:01:44.649 
the circuit working of course under load

00:01:44.649 --> 00:01:47.999 
the circuit working of course under load
the<00:01:44.890> motor<00:01:45.130> actually<00:01:45.759> come<00:01:46.539> to<00:01:46.810> a<00:01:47.350> fairly<00:01:47.830> low

00:01:47.999 --> 00:01:48.009 
the motor actually come to a fairly low

00:01:48.009 --> 00:01:53.880 
the motor actually come to a fairly low
rpm<00:01:48.550> and<00:01:48.850> I<00:01:49.600> have<00:01:49.750> a<00:01:50.190> 1.6<00:01:51.190> T<00:01:51.369> 1<00:01:51.520> volt<00:01:52.770> kind<00:01:53.770> of

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:53.890 
rpm and I have a 1.6 T 1 volt kind of

00:01:53.890 --> 00:01:56.040 
rpm and I have a 1.6 T 1 volt kind of
fairly<00:01:54.250> stable<00:01:54.580> and<00:01:54.970> I've<00:01:55.090> bet<00:01:55.360> this<00:01:55.659> engine

00:01:56.040 --> 00:01:56.050 
fairly stable and I've bet this engine

00:01:56.050 --> 00:01:58.710 
fairly stable and I've bet this engine
has<00:01:56.080> been<00:01:56.440> running<00:01:56.800> for<00:01:57.039> about<00:01:57.210> 20<00:01:58.210> minutes<00:01:58.390> so

00:01:58.710 --> 00:01:58.720 
has been running for about 20 minutes so

00:01:58.720 --> 00:02:02.490 
has been running for about 20 minutes so
far<00:01:58.770> and<00:01:59.770> I'm<00:02:00.759> still<00:02:01.030> having<00:02:01.300> plenty<00:02:02.080> of<00:02:02.229> fuel

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:02.500 
far and I'm still having plenty of fuel

00:02:02.500 --> 00:02:05.820 
far and I'm still having plenty of fuel
in<00:02:02.710> there<00:02:02.920> and<00:02:03.509> this<00:02:04.509> is<00:02:04.780> the<00:02:04.929> lighthouse<00:02:05.289> the

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:05.830 
in there and this is the lighthouse the

00:02:05.830 --> 00:02:09.359 
in there and this is the lighthouse the
light<00:02:06.069> output<00:02:06.340> they<00:02:06.940> actually<00:02:07.149> have<00:02:08.369> with

00:02:09.359 --> 00:02:09.369 
light output they actually have with

00:02:09.369 --> 00:02:12.750 
light output they actually have with
that<00:02:09.519> much<00:02:09.789> voltage<00:02:10.739> it<00:02:11.739> is<00:02:11.920> still<00:02:12.220> quite

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:12.760 
that much voltage it is still quite

00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:15.360 
that much voltage it is still quite
bright<00:02:13.540> in<00:02:13.780> here<00:02:13.810> I<00:02:14.079> can<00:02:14.440> still<00:02:14.709> see<00:02:14.980> the<00:02:15.130> Sun

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:15.370 
bright in here I can still see the Sun

00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:21.420 
bright in here I can still see the Sun
but<00:02:16.799> those<00:02:17.799> are<00:02:18.280> actually<00:02:18.970> two<00:02:19.299> what<00:02:19.950> a<00:02:20.950> super

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:21.430 
but those are actually two what a super

00:02:21.430 --> 00:02:26.220 
but those are actually two what a super
bright<00:02:21.970> LED<00:02:22.269> that<00:02:23.110> I<00:02:23.140> got<00:02:23.500> from<00:02:24.280> me<00:02:24.610> a<00:02:25.230> little

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:26.230 
bright LED that I got from me a little

00:02:26.230 --> 00:02:29.699 
bright LED that I got from me a little
12<00:02:27.010> volt<00:02:27.310> light<00:02:28.180> that<00:02:28.480> actually<00:02:28.930> i<00:02:28.959> dismantle

00:02:29.699 --> 00:02:29.709 
12 volt light that actually i dismantle

00:02:29.709 --> 00:02:32.670 
12 volt light that actually i dismantle
it<00:02:29.829> and<00:02:29.980> I<00:02:30.610> took<00:02:30.670> the<00:02:31.060> LED<00:02:31.510> the<00:02:31.810> LED<00:02:32.260> the<00:02:32.530> two

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:32.680 
it and I took the LED the LED the two

00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:35.220 
it and I took the LED the LED the two
LEDs<00:02:33.100> are<00:02:33.400> occur<00:02:33.700> are<00:02:33.940> connected<00:02:34.660> in<00:02:34.780> series

00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:35.230 
LEDs are occur are connected in series

00:02:35.230 --> 00:02:39.979 
LEDs are occur are connected in series
and<00:02:36.959> these<00:02:37.959> at<00:02:38.290> hope<00:02:38.500> our<00:02:38.739> actually<00:02:39.340> consume

00:02:39.979 --> 00:02:39.989 
and these at hope our actually consume

00:02:39.989 --> 00:02:44.580 
and these at hope our actually consume
roughly<00:02:40.989> 300<00:02:41.560> milliamps<00:02:42.570> so<00:02:43.570> it<00:02:43.930> is<00:02:44.380> quite

00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:44.590 
roughly 300 milliamps so it is quite

00:02:44.590 --> 00:02:47.580 
roughly 300 milliamps so it is quite
powerful<00:02:45.280> and<00:02:45.400> the<00:02:46.239> two<00:02:46.420> LED<00:02:46.840> that<00:02:47.200> are<00:02:47.320> right

00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:47.590 
powerful and the two LED that are right

00:02:47.590 --> 00:02:49.979 
powerful and the two LED that are right
right<00:02:48.010> there<00:02:48.250> are<00:02:48.519> actually<00:02:49.090> for<00:02:49.480> the<00:02:49.510> voltage

00:02:49.979 --> 00:02:49.989 
right there are actually for the voltage

00:02:49.989 --> 00:02:54.090 
right there are actually for the voltage
regulating<00:02:51.540> so<00:02:52.540> as<00:02:53.290> you<00:02:53.440> can<00:02:53.560> hear<00:02:53.829> now<00:02:54.040> the

00:02:54.090 --> 00:02:54.100 
regulating so as you can hear now the

00:02:54.100 --> 00:02:57.720 
regulating so as you can hear now the
motor<00:02:54.459> is<00:02:54.670> getting<00:02:55.030> picked<00:02:55.510> up<00:02:55.690> and<00:02:56.489> 3.3<00:02:57.489> volt

00:02:57.720 --> 00:02:57.730 
motor is getting picked up and 3.3 volt

00:02:57.730 --> 00:03:00.509 
motor is getting picked up and 3.3 volt
back<00:02:57.970> again<00:02:58.269> actually<00:02:59.230> now<00:02:59.410> the<00:03:00.100> motor<00:03:00.340> is

00:03:00.509 --> 00:03:00.519 
back again actually now the motor is

00:03:00.519 --> 00:03:03.090 
back again actually now the motor is
considered<00:03:01.000> no<00:03:01.209> load<00:03:01.450> because<00:03:02.440> those<00:03:02.799> two

00:03:03.090 --> 00:03:03.100 
considered no load because those two

00:03:03.100 --> 00:03:06.539 
considered no load because those two
dials<00:03:03.549> here<00:03:03.910> this<00:03:04.480> one<00:03:04.690> is<00:03:04.720> a<00:03:04.840> 1.5<00:03:05.620> volt<00:03:06.100> red

00:03:06.539 --> 00:03:06.549 
dials here this one is a 1.5 volt red

00:03:06.549 --> 00:03:11.640 
dials here this one is a 1.5 volt red
LED<00:03:07.060> and<00:03:07.329> it's<00:03:07.780> a<00:03:08.970> two-point<00:03:09.970> something<00:03:10.650> green

00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:11.650 
LED and it's a two-point something green

00:03:11.650 --> 00:03:14.220 
LED and it's a two-point something green
one<00:03:11.920> and<00:03:12.130> what<00:03:12.670> actually<00:03:12.880> did<00:03:13.329> do<00:03:13.660> it's<00:03:14.019> it

00:03:14.220 --> 00:03:14.230 
one and what actually did do it's it

00:03:14.230 --> 00:03:15.670 
one and what actually did do it's it
feeds<00:03:14.500> back<00:03:14.739> to<00:03:15.010> the

00:03:15.670 --> 00:03:15.680 
feeds back to the

00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:18.640 
feeds back to the
p<00:03:15.920> transistor<00:03:16.609> and<00:03:16.819> actually<00:03:17.239> shut<00:03:17.599> down<00:03:17.870> the

00:03:18.640 --> 00:03:18.650 
p transistor and actually shut down the

00:03:18.650 --> 00:03:21.880 
p transistor and actually shut down the
completes<00:03:19.099> circuit<00:03:19.760> here<00:03:20.230> and<00:03:21.230> as<00:03:21.349> soon<00:03:21.620> as<00:03:21.799> i

00:03:21.880 --> 00:03:21.890 
completes circuit here and as soon as i

00:03:21.890 --> 00:03:25.740 
completes circuit here and as soon as i
connect<00:03:22.959> you<00:03:23.959> here<00:03:24.230> at<00:03:24.349> loading<00:03:25.129> again<00:03:25.430> and

00:03:25.740 --> 00:03:25.750 
connect you here at loading again and

00:03:25.750 --> 00:03:29.289 
connect you here at loading again and
bright<00:03:26.750> light<00:03:26.959> i<00:03:26.989> have<00:03:27.519> so<00:03:28.519> for<00:03:28.879> the<00:03:29.030> little

00:03:29.289 --> 00:03:29.299 
bright light i have so for the little

00:03:29.299 --> 00:03:33.819 
bright light i have so for the little
flame<00:03:29.659> that<00:03:29.840> I<00:03:29.900> have<00:03:30.140> there<00:03:31.569> which<00:03:32.569> is<00:03:32.829> fairly

00:03:33.819 --> 00:03:33.829 
flame that I have there which is fairly

00:03:33.829 --> 00:03:36.690 
flame that I have there which is fairly
hot<00:03:34.129> but<00:03:34.819> does<00:03:35.030> not<00:03:35.209> produce<00:03:35.420> any<00:03:35.810> light<00:03:36.049> I

00:03:36.690 --> 00:03:36.700 
hot but does not produce any light I

00:03:36.700 --> 00:03:42.069 
hot but does not produce any light I
have<00:03:37.700> this<00:03:37.939> I<00:03:40.030> find<00:03:41.030> that<00:03:41.150> I<00:03:41.389> found<00:03:41.659> it<00:03:41.810> it's

00:03:42.069 --> 00:03:42.079 
have this I find that I found it it's

00:03:42.079 --> 00:03:46.869 
have this I find that I found it it's
interesting<00:03:42.889> so<00:03:44.950> might<00:03:45.950> show<00:03:46.219> it<00:03:46.250> to<00:03:46.489> everyone

00:03:46.869 --> 00:03:46.879 
interesting so might show it to everyone

00:03:46.879 --> 00:03:50.049 
interesting so might show it to everyone
all<00:03:47.450> right<00:03:47.599> have<00:03:47.780> a<00:03:47.810> good<00:03:47.989> day
