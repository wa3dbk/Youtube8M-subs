00:00:14.539 --> 00:00:14.549 
in an environment kind of like this but

00:00:14.549 --> 00:00:16.390 
in an environment kind of like this but
what<00:00:14.730> if<00:00:14.820> we<00:00:14.969> could<00:00:15.120> do<00:00:15.269> this<00:00:15.420> differently

what if we could do this differently
let's<00:00:17.400> face<00:00:17.640> it<00:00:17.840> modern<00:00:18.840> farming<00:00:19.289> is<00:00:19.800> hard<00:00:19.859> on

00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:20.250 
let's face it modern farming is hard on

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:23.000 
let's face it modern farming is hard on
the<00:00:20.369> earth<00:00:20.550> it's<00:00:21.180> hard<00:00:21.449> on<00:00:21.510> animals<00:00:22.109> and<00:00:22.859> it's

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:23.010 
the earth it's hard on animals and it's

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:25.490 
the earth it's hard on animals and it's

heavy on chemicals what if we could meet
our<00:00:25.710> protein<00:00:26.160> needs<00:00:26.460> in<00:00:26.880> a<00:00:27.029> totally<00:00:27.599> different

00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:27.900 
our protein needs in a totally different

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:31.580 
our protein needs in a totally different
way<00:00:28.019> on<00:00:28.910> average<00:00:29.910> for<00:00:30.599> every<00:00:30.630> 1<00:00:31.050> pound<00:00:31.320> of

00:00:31.580 --> 00:00:31.590 
way on average for every 1 pound of

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:34.220 
way on average for every 1 pound of
animal<00:00:31.980> protein<00:00:32.480> livestock<00:00:33.480> are<00:00:33.660> fed<00:00:33.840> 6

animal protein livestock are fed 6

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:36.620 
animal protein livestock are fed 6
pounds<00:00:34.620> of<00:00:34.680> plant<00:00:35.010> protein<00:00:35.430> and<00:00:35.730> that's<00:00:36.270> even

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:36.630 
pounds of plant protein and that's even

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:38.569 
pounds of plant protein and that's even
kind<00:00:36.870> of<00:00:36.930> a<00:00:37.020> starvation<00:00:37.410> diet<00:00:37.649> let's<00:00:38.190> be<00:00:38.370> real

00:00:38.569 --> 00:00:38.579 
kind of a starvation diet let's be real

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:41.150 
kind of a starvation diet let's be real
so<00:00:39.239> that's<00:00:39.420> two<00:00:39.719> and<00:00:39.750> a<00:00:39.870> half<00:00:40.050> pounds<00:00:40.649> for<00:00:40.980> 1

00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:41.160 
so that's two and a half pounds for 1

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:43.910 
so that's two and a half pounds for 1
pound<00:00:41.370> chicken<00:00:41.850> 5<00:00:42.540> pounds<00:00:43.110> for<00:00:43.290> 1<00:00:43.500> pound<00:00:43.710> of

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:43.920 
pound chicken 5 pounds for 1 pound of

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:46.520 
pound chicken 5 pounds for 1 pound of
pork<00:00:44.160> and<00:00:44.370> 10<00:00:44.730> pounds<00:00:45.300> for<00:00:45.420> one<00:00:45.930> pound<00:00:46.200> of<00:00:46.320> beef

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:46.530 
pork and 10 pounds for one pound of beef

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:50.000 
pork and 10 pounds for one pound of beef
isn't<00:00:47.460> it<00:00:47.789> a<00:00:47.820> little<00:00:47.969> wasteful<00:00:48.680> say<00:00:49.680> hey<00:00:49.950> to

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:50.010 
isn't it a little wasteful say hey to

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:50.650 
isn't it a little wasteful say hey to

what's rad is that insects are just out
in<00:00:53.670> the<00:00:53.730> world<00:00:54.059> there<00:00:54.420> are<00:00:54.539> so<00:00:54.899> many<00:00:55.050> bugs<00:00:55.379> in

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:55.530 
in the world there are so many bugs in

in the world there are so many bugs in
the<00:00:55.680> world<00:00:56.329> 80%<00:00:57.329> of<00:00:57.420> this<00:00:57.510> cricket<00:00:57.780> is<00:00:58.109> edible

00:00:58.549 --> 00:00:58.559 
the world 80% of this cricket is edible

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:02.389 
the world 80% of this cricket is edible
and<00:00:58.859> digestible<00:00:59.989> that's<00:01:00.989> compared<00:01:01.350> to<00:01:01.379> 55%<00:01:01.980> of

flower<00:01:47.720> go<00:01:48.720> bugs<00:01:48.990> I<00:01:49.320> think<00:01:49.860> that's<00:01:50.009> a<00:01:50.130> pretty

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:50.310 
flower go bugs I think that's a pretty

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:53.890 
flower go bugs I think that's a pretty
resounding<00:01:50.759> conclusion<00:01:51.720> don't<00:01:52.020> you

00:01:53.890 --> 00:01:53.900 
resounding conclusion don't you

00:01:53.900 --> 00:01:56.740 
resounding conclusion don't you
so<00:01:54.500> just<00:01:54.770> to<00:01:54.920> get<00:01:55.010> this<00:01:55.190> straight<00:01:55.750> globally

00:01:56.740 --> 00:01:56.750 
so just to get this straight globally

00:01:56.750 --> 00:01:59.260 
so just to get this straight globally
people<00:01:57.470> are<00:01:57.590> already<00:01:58.130> eating<00:01:58.340> bugs<00:01:58.700> and<00:01:59.060> it's

00:01:59.260 --> 00:01:59.270 
people are already eating bugs and it's

00:01:59.270 --> 00:02:02.260 
people are already eating bugs and it's
totally<00:01:59.600> not<00:01:59.960> weird<00:02:00.310> insects<00:02:01.310> have<00:02:01.520> a<00:02:01.550> super

00:02:02.260 --> 00:02:02.270 
totally not weird insects have a super

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:05.050 
totally not weird insects have a super
low<00:02:02.450> carbon<00:02:02.960> footprint<00:02:03.410> and<00:02:03.880> they're<00:02:04.880> not

00:02:05.050 --> 00:02:05.060 
low carbon footprint and they're not

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:07.690 
low carbon footprint and they're not
really<00:02:05.300> that<00:02:05.540> close<00:02:05.750> man<00:02:06.160> so<00:02:07.160> what<00:02:07.340> do<00:02:07.400> you<00:02:07.490> say

00:02:07.690 --> 00:02:07.700 
really that close man so what do you say

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:11.800 
really that close man so what do you say
are<00:02:08.330> you<00:02:08.450> ready<00:02:08.630> to<00:02:08.780> be<00:02:08.869> a<00:02:08.900> badass<00:02:09.140> come<00:02:09.680> on
