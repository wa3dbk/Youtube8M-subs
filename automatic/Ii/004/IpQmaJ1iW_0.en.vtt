00:05:08.050 --> 00:05:08.060 
mechanics of it it looks like a regular

00:05:08.060 --> 00:05:09.670 
mechanics of it it looks like a regular
bike<00:05:08.389> so<00:05:08.539> that<00:05:08.659> they're<00:05:08.780> not<00:05:08.900> put<00:05:09.289> off<00:05:09.409> by<00:05:09.620> it

00:05:09.670 --> 00:05:09.680 
bike so that they're not put off by it

00:05:09.680 --> 00:05:11.409 
bike so that they're not put off by it
and<00:05:09.919> they<00:05:10.430> can<00:05:10.580> just<00:05:10.610> hop<00:05:10.849> on<00:05:11.030> it<00:05:11.180> and<00:05:11.210> then

00:05:11.409 --> 00:05:11.419 
and they can just hop on it and then

00:05:11.419 --> 00:05:14.379 
and they can just hop on it and then
they<00:05:11.570> get<00:05:12.110> that<00:05:12.169> surprise<00:05:12.680> added<00:05:13.190> bonus<00:05:13.789> of<00:05:13.970> a

00:05:14.379 --> 00:05:14.389 
they get that surprise added bonus of a

00:05:14.389 --> 00:05:18.100 
they get that surprise added bonus of a
boost<00:05:14.900> as<00:05:15.770> a<00:05:16.039> 36<00:05:16.639> volt<00:05:16.789> battery<00:05:17.120> and<00:05:17.300> a<00:05:17.479> 350

00:05:18.100 --> 00:05:18.110 
boost as a 36 volt battery and a 350

00:05:18.110 --> 00:05:21.350 
boost as a 36 volt battery and a 350
watt<00:05:18.139> motor

00:05:21.350 --> 00:05:21.360 

00:05:21.360 --> 00:05:25.409 

also<00:05:22.360> has<00:05:22.570> the<00:05:23.110> pedal<00:05:23.979> assist<00:05:24.310> and<00:05:24.639> throttle

00:05:25.409 --> 00:05:25.419 
also has the pedal assist and throttle

00:05:25.419 --> 00:05:26.969 
also has the pedal assist and throttle
so<00:05:25.960> once<00:05:26.110> you<00:05:26.199> get<00:05:26.290> up<00:05:26.410> to<00:05:26.500> speed<00:05:26.680> you<00:05:26.770> can<00:05:26.860> just

00:05:26.969 --> 00:05:26.979 
so once you get up to speed you can just

00:05:26.979 --> 00:05:28.320 
so once you get up to speed you can just
throw<00:05:27.130> on<00:05:27.160> the<00:05:27.280> throttle<00:05:27.610> it's<00:05:27.729> essentially<00:05:28.300> a

00:05:28.320 --> 00:05:28.330 
throw on the throttle it's essentially a

00:05:28.330 --> 00:05:29.879 
throw on the throttle it's essentially a
cruise<00:05:28.540> control<00:05:28.870> for<00:05:29.020> you<00:05:29.139> real<00:05:29.470> easy<00:05:29.500> to<00:05:29.770> ride

00:05:29.879 --> 00:05:29.889
