and you know this is what I get annoyed
at<00:01:24.600> and<00:01:25.280> now<00:01:26.280> the<00:01:27.180> warranty<00:01:28.110> it's<00:01:29.070> a<00:01:29.220> limited

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:29.400 
at and now the warranty it's a limited

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:32.090 
at and now the warranty it's a limited
warranty<00:01:30.030> so<00:01:30.270> it's<00:01:30.390> only<00:01:30.509> unlimited<00:01:31.100> things

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:32.100

warranty so it's only unlimited things
and<00:01:32.549> this<00:01:32.790> probably<00:01:33.150> is<00:01:33.329> not<00:01:33.509> covered<00:01:34.049> by<00:01:34.259> the

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:38.420 
and this probably is not covered by the
warranty<00:01:36.110> but<00:01:37.110> in<00:01:37.350> my<00:01:37.530> opinion<00:01:37.650> just<00:01:38.159> don't

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:38.430
