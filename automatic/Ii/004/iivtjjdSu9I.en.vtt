00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.908
 What I want to show you in this video is how to extract numbers in a new way that is different from the way you regroup. 

00:00:06.908 --> 00:00:10.069
 This is actually close to what I do in my mind. 

00:00:10.069 --> 00:00:14.060
 This may not be the way you use at school, so be careful. 

00:00:14.060 --> 00:00:17.825
 Some people would not fully agree with what I'm going to show you. 

00:00:17.825 --> 00:00:22.595
 But the reason I'm showing you this is to see that there are other ways of subtraction. 

00:00:22.595 --> 00:00:27.017
 As you understand and follow the basic principles - what these numbers are - 

00:00:27.017 --> 00:00:30.439
 and doing things that make sense, you will do it. 

00:00:30.439 --> 00:00:32.685
 The good thing about this technique is that there is no need for regrouping. 

00:00:32.685 --> 00:00:36.005
 We will start from the place of the hundreds and continue on. 

00:00:36.005 --> 00:00:45.405
 So, for example, if we get 301, and first out of 300 deduct 100, we get 200. 

00:00:45.405 --> 00:00:49.693
 Now I have to get 60. And now I can think of the question "What is 20?" 

00:00:49.693 --> 00:00:55.268
 Two-zero minus six. So, it actually says, "What is 200 - 60?" 

00:00:55.268 --> 00:00:58.951
 20 - 6 = 14. 

00:00:58.951 --> 00:01:02.202
 So I just get out, then I'm left with 14. 

00:01:02.202 --> 00:01:06.287
 So the task brings us to 141-9. 

00:01:06.287 --> 00:01:12.051
 Now we just have to think about how much 141 - 9 is. 

00:01:12.051 --> 00:01:21.202
 141 - (and this will be a bit more mental comparing than what you may be accustomed to). But 141 - 9 = 132. 

00:01:21.202 --> 00:01:27.018
 We stayed with 132. 

00:01:27.018 --> 00:01:28.458
 Let's solve this too. The same way. 

00:01:28.458 --> 00:01:32.472
 I advise you to stop the video and try to solve the problem yourself using the same way. 

00:01:32.472 --> 00:01:37.940
 9 - 2 is really 900 - 200. You will stay with 700. 

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:42.044
 Then 71-8. 

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:48.137
 Let's see. 11 - 8 is 3. You are left with 63. 

00:01:48.137 --> 00:01:52.670
 Now we have to draw: 633-6. 

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:56.617
 13 - 6 is 7. This will be 627. 

00:01:59.208 --> 00:02:02.535
 Once again, stop the video and try to solve it yourself. 

00:02:02.535 --> 00:02:07.005
 I have no hundreds to take out, so I can go straight to 72-8 

00:02:07.005 --> 00:02:09.202
 which is the same as 720-80. 

00:02:09.202 --> 00:02:12.071
 But let's use 72-8. 

00:02:12.071 --> 00:02:19.328
 12 - 8 is 4. Then 72 - 8 is 64. 

00:02:19.328 --> 00:02:23.443
 This is the same thing as 641-8. 

00:02:23.443 --> 00:02:28.195
 41 - 8 is 33. 

00:02:28.195 --> 00:02:30.862
 Here I have to do a little mental calculation. 

00:02:30.862 --> 00:02:36.691
 So we get 633.
