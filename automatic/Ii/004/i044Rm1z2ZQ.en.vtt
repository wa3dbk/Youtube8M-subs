00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.799
 the ford's new identity will gradually go 

00:00:02.700 --> 00:00:05.549
 taking care of the family and with something to 

00:00:04.799 --> 00:00:07.940
 more 

00:00:05.549 --> 00:00:10.440
 md tested a new model of the new party 

00:00:07.940 --> 00:00:13.320
 shows the changes that go beyond 

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:15.740
 new face design and 

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:19.890
 new birth is the new model party 

00:00:15.740 --> 00:00:22.260
 2014 more friendly and now national more 

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:24.840
 knows what is better in being a project 

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:27.119
 overall it's just like the ones done there 

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:29.070
 out do you think any car 

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:32.750
 compact that can be equipped with the 

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:35.040
 assistant at ramp abs 

00:00:32.750 --> 00:00:38.370
 electronic traction controls and 

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:40.200
 stability and up to seven airbags being one 

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:42.090
 to the driver's knees 

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:44.370
 so you can not understand why not 

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:46.710
 has a head support and a three-belt 

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:49.170
 points for those who try here in between 

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:52.199
 always, do not slip off the chair and 

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:54.149
 ford new fiesta 2014 has become 

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:57.149
 reference for the compact segment 

00:00:54.149 --> 00:00:58.949
 in brazil besides safety in mechanics 

00:00:57.149 --> 00:01:01.739
 can be equipped with an exchange 

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:04.729
 powershift that allows even performance 

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:06.960
 of the manual but forget the pedal I hope 

00:01:04.729 --> 00:01:10.290
 with double clutch and six 

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:13.110
 marches is the same as eco sport does 

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:16.140
 Automatically switches the mode 

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:18.540
 with still in the sequential manual 

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:19.439
 that by means of this chinfrim button 

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:21.390
 here o 

00:01:19.439 --> 00:01:24.090
 seemed to be pure letters behind the 

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:24.869
 steering wheel or at least the 

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:27.840
 exchange right 

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:30.299
 the engine is the same 1.6 sigma but had 

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:32.430
 several improvements with commands 

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:34.860
 of variable valves a system of 

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:37.049
 electronic cold start for those who are 

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:39.810
 supplied with ethanol that eliminates 

00:01:37.049 --> 00:01:42.110
 gasoline and provides 15 

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:44.820
 more horses compared to the interior 

00:01:42.110 --> 00:01:47.700
 has the characteristic of good torque in 

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:50.009
 low speeds in partnership with the exchange 

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:52.229
 automation allows accelerations and 

00:01:50.009 --> 00:01:54.960
 resets appropriate to the 

00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:57.570
 car or add up well but could be 

00:01:54.960 --> 00:02:00.329
 better in our test circuit than 

00:01:57.570 --> 00:02:03.600
 half city half road made average 

00:02:00.329 --> 00:02:06.470
 of 6.8 kilometers per liter of ethanol and 

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:07.940
 9.6 case 

00:02:06.470 --> 00:02:08.210
 the old model 

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:09.560
 [Applause] 

00:02:08.210 --> 00:02:11.690
 [Music] 

00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:14.930
 electric power steering and the 

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:16.700
 efficient brakes convey safety 

00:02:14.930 --> 00:02:18.410
 on the other side the rear visibility 

00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:20.930
 error 

00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:23.750
 At least it has reverse sensors that help 

00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:25.280
 at the time of indoor parking 

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:28.400
 practically did not change 

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:31.190
 it is nice and the finish well done the 

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:33.310
 leather seats help but exaggerates 

00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:36.680
 use of hard plastic in the coating 

00:02:33.310 --> 00:02:39.320
 trio electric digital air conditioning and 

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:41.300
 add - on-board computer 

00:02:39.320 --> 00:02:42.260
 space is good for four adults and one 

00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:44.870
 kid 

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:45.830
 the trunk like almost all cars 

00:02:44.870 --> 00:02:48.380
 that the hatch 

00:02:45.830 --> 00:02:50.420
 capacity is limited but you can 

00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:52.910
 rebate the rear seat backrest 

00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:55.520
 abstention is fine and privileges 

00:02:52.910 --> 00:03:00.130
 stability at the same time is not 

00:02:55.520 --> 00:03:00.130
 match and is very enjoyable to drive 

00:03:02.050 --> 00:03:07.150
 besides the good position for the driver is 

00:03:04.600 --> 00:03:08.880
 internally quiet even when 

00:03:07.150 --> 00:03:11.400
 wheel on bad floors 

00:03:08.880 --> 00:03:14.290
 interesting the multimedia system as 

00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:16.510
 controls cellular sound and several 

00:03:14.290 --> 00:03:19.990
 car settings also by 

00:03:16.510 --> 00:03:22.630
 voice command is not one of the most intuitive 

00:03:19.990 --> 00:03:24.580
 but the biggest sin is not offering gps 

00:03:22.630 --> 00:03:27.040
 common today 

00:03:24.580 --> 00:03:29.890
 well equipped mainly in this version 

00:03:27.040 --> 00:03:32.230
 titanium the new fiesta justifies the price 

00:03:29.890 --> 00:03:35.140
 and will make his competitors run 

00:03:32.230 --> 00:03:43.490
 back to equalize good for us right 

00:03:35.140 --> 00:03:44.610
 [Music] 

00:03:43.490 --> 00:03:47.230
 [Applause] 

00:03:44.610 --> 00:03:48.730
 the new fiesta hatch is only sold in 

00:03:47.230 --> 00:03:51.340
 closed catalogs 

00:03:48.730 --> 00:03:55.870
 the cheapest version comes with 1.5 and 

00:03:51.340 --> 00:03:57.460
 It costs 39 1890 to have a 1.6 engine the 

00:03:55.870 --> 00:04:00.010
 computer will have to pay for the 

00:03:57.460 --> 00:04:03.340
 minus 46 thousand three hundred and forty reais 

00:04:00.010 --> 00:04:06.730
 by new fiesta rs is but there are still two 

00:04:03.340 --> 00:04:10.450
 more complete titanium versions of 52 

00:04:06.730 --> 00:04:15.070
 and 340 thousand equal to titanium powershift 

00:04:10.450 --> 00:04:17.380
 movie just tested that it costs 56,840 

00:04:15.070 --> 00:04:20.620
 but enough talk time nec notes 

00:04:17.380 --> 00:04:23.520
 and this Ford had a compliance bulletin 

00:04:20.620 --> 00:04:26.410
 the date with 8 consumption performance 

00:04:23.520 --> 00:04:29.020
 security takes nine stability 

00:04:26.410 --> 00:04:32.020
 finish plus two notes 8 the space 

00:04:29.020 --> 00:04:36.480
 internal 7 trunk other seven 

00:04:32.020 --> 00:04:36.480
