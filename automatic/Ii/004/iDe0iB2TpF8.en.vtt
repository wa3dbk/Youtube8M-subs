00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:17.490 
one that I picked up when it was really

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:19.249 
one that I picked up when it was really
really<00:01:17.610> cheap<00:01:17.850> it<00:01:18.030> still<00:01:18.240> is<00:01:18.420> very<00:01:18.509> very<00:01:18.990> cheap

00:01:19.249 --> 00:01:19.259 
really cheap it still is very very cheap

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:21.230 
really cheap it still is very very cheap
now<00:01:19.740> it<00:01:19.890> came<00:01:20.100> out<00:01:20.310> as<00:01:20.460> a<00:01:20.490> super<00:01:20.880> rare<00:01:21.000> in

00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:21.240

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:23.630 
now it came out as a super rare in
crimson<00:01:21.540> crisis<00:01:22.229> so<00:01:22.890> it's<00:01:23.130> not<00:01:23.310> exactly

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:23.640 
crimson crisis so it's not exactly

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:25.399 
crimson crisis so it's not exactly
difficult<00:01:23.759> to<00:01:24.240> pick<00:01:24.420> up<00:01:24.570> because<00:01:24.810> that<00:01:25.080> set

00:01:25.399 --> 00:01:25.409 
difficult to pick up because that set

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:27.440 
difficult to pick up because that set
wasn't<00:01:25.950> the<00:01:26.189> greatest<00:01:26.430> from<00:01:27.000> what<00:01:27.210> I<00:01:27.240> remember

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:27.450 
wasn't the greatest from what I remember

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:30.289 
wasn't the greatest from what I remember
it's<00:01:28.290> not<00:01:28.500> like<00:01:28.650> Star<00:01:28.860> Trek<00:01:28.890> blaster<00:01:29.700> it's

00:01:30.289 --> 00:01:30.299 
it's not like Star Trek blaster it's

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:31.340 
it's not like Star Trek blaster it's
just<00:01:30.630> brutal

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:31.350 
just brutal

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:33.050 
just brutal
now<00:01:31.500> everything's<00:01:32.159> expensive<00:01:32.430> if<00:01:32.759> we<00:01:32.880> just

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:33.060 
now everything's expensive if we just

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:34.940 
now everything's expensive if we just
talk<00:01:33.240> about<00:01:33.509> the<00:01:33.600> card<00:01:33.840> itself<00:01:34.290> and<00:01:34.619> how<00:01:34.770> it

talk about the card itself and how it

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:37.550 
talk about the card itself and how it
can<00:01:35.159> combo<00:01:35.640> up<00:01:35.850> and<00:01:36.119> how<00:01:36.570> it<00:01:36.750> can<00:01:36.900> really<00:01:36.960> hurt

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:37.560 
can combo up and how it can really hurt

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:40.219 
can combo up and how it can really hurt
some<00:01:37.920> of<00:01:38.040> those<00:01:38.130> decks<00:01:38.490> it<00:01:38.909> might<00:01:39.750> change<00:01:40.110> your

lot of cards that are utilized like for

00:02:32.830 --> 00:02:34.380 
lot of cards that are utilized like for
example<00:02:32.920> banishing<00:02:33.580> the<00:02:33.640> radiance<00:02:34.030> have

quite<00:02:34.750> low<00:02:35.140> attack<00:02:35.590> I<00:02:35.620> think<00:02:35.770> banishes<00:02:36.330> 1300

00:02:37.320 --> 00:02:37.330 
quite low attack I think banishes 1300

00:02:37.330 --> 00:02:39.840 
quite low attack I think banishes 1300
attack<00:02:37.600> and<00:02:37.870> it<00:02:38.560> suffers<00:02:39.280> from<00:02:39.400> being<00:02:39.640> able<00:02:39.730> to

00:02:43.020 --> 00:02:43.030 
be punched over quite easily with 1,700

sending everything to the grave which a
shuttle<00:03:20.980> Fusion<00:03:21.489> sends<00:03:21.880> in<00:03:21.970> one<00:03:22.150> from<00:03:22.360> the

00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:22.450 
shuttle Fusion sends in one from the

00:03:22.450 --> 00:03:24.509 
shuttle Fusion sends in one from the
deck<00:03:22.630> for<00:03:22.750> example<00:03:23.200> they<00:03:23.560> can't<00:03:23.830> do<00:03:24.070> that<00:03:24.280> so

00:03:24.509 --> 00:03:24.519 
deck for example they can't do that so

00:03:24.519 --> 00:03:26.310 
deck for example they can't do that so
they<00:03:24.610> can't<00:03:24.820> actually<00:03:25.420> fulfill<00:03:25.930> the

00:03:26.310 --> 00:03:26.320 
they can't actually fulfill the

00:03:26.320 --> 00:03:28.740 
they can't actually fulfill the
requirements<00:03:27.130> so<00:03:27.730> you<00:03:27.760> can<00:03:27.970> stop<00:03:28.239> them<00:03:28.420> summon

00:03:28.740 --> 00:03:28.750 
requirements so you can stop them summon

00:03:28.750 --> 00:03:30.509 
requirements so you can stop them summon
in<00:03:28.870> their<00:03:29.019> window<00:03:29.380> or<00:03:29.560> their<00:03:29.769> constructs<00:03:30.280> and

00:03:30.509 --> 00:03:30.519 
in their window or their constructs and

00:03:30.519 --> 00:03:32.940 
in their window or their constructs and
it's<00:03:30.910> quite<00:03:31.090> an<00:03:31.180> interesting<00:03:31.269> card<00:03:31.959> it's<00:03:32.650> one

00:03:32.940 --> 00:03:32.950 
it's quite an interesting card it's one

00:03:32.950 --> 00:03:34.470 
it's quite an interesting card it's one
that<00:03:33.070> has<00:03:33.160> flown<00:03:33.459> under<00:03:33.610> the<00:03:33.790> radar<00:03:33.880> and<00:03:34.420> you

00:03:34.470 --> 00:03:34.480 
that has flown under the radar and you

00:03:34.480 --> 00:03:35.729 
that has flown under the radar and you
might<00:03:34.750> think<00:03:34.780> it's<00:03:35.140> flown<00:03:35.380> under<00:03:35.530> the<00:03:35.650> radar

00:03:35.729 --> 00:03:35.739 
might think it's flown under the radar

00:03:35.739 --> 00:03:37.740 
might think it's flown under the radar
for<00:03:36.010> good<00:03:36.250> reason<00:03:36.610> because<00:03:36.730> it's<00:03:37.000> jammed<00:03:37.269> you

00:03:37.740 --> 00:03:37.750 
for good reason because it's jammed you

00:03:37.750 --> 00:03:39.570 
for good reason because it's jammed you
might<00:03:37.900> think<00:03:38.200> it's<00:03:38.470> just<00:03:38.560> not<00:03:38.920> worth<00:03:39.130> it

00:03:39.570 --> 00:03:39.580 
might think it's just not worth it

00:03:39.580 --> 00:03:40.860 
might think it's just not worth it
it<00:03:39.700> gives<00:03:39.910> up<00:03:40.030> your<00:03:40.180> normal<00:03:40.480> summon<00:03:40.660> which

00:03:40.860 --> 00:03:40.870 
it gives up your normal summon which

00:03:40.870 --> 00:03:42.479 
it gives up your normal summon which
makes<00:03:41.110> it<00:03:41.260> a<00:03:41.320> problem<00:03:41.530> because<00:03:41.890> you<00:03:42.100> can't<00:03:42.340> get

00:03:42.479 --> 00:03:42.489 
makes it a problem because you can't get

00:03:42.489 --> 00:03:44.490 
makes it a problem because you can't get
rolling<00:03:42.940> with<00:03:42.970> certain<00:03:43.420> decks<00:03:43.690> that<00:03:44.230> might

00:03:44.490 --> 00:03:44.500 
rolling with certain decks that might

00:03:44.500 --> 00:03:46.920 
rolling with certain decks that might
need<00:03:44.769> to<00:03:44.950> keep<00:03:45.130> their<00:03:45.340> normal<00:03:45.700> summon<00:03:45.970> and<00:03:46.239> you

00:03:46.920 --> 00:03:46.930 
need to keep their normal summon and you

00:03:46.930 --> 00:03:48.990 
need to keep their normal summon and you
might<00:03:47.110> feel<00:03:47.350> more<00:03:47.470> safe<00:03:47.920> with<00:03:47.980> spell<00:03:48.640> of<00:03:48.730> traps

00:03:48.990 --> 00:03:49.000 
might feel more safe with spell of traps

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:51.060 
might feel more safe with spell of traps
because<00:03:49.510> it<00:03:49.959> doesn't<00:03:50.260> really<00:03:50.380> take<00:03:50.680> up<00:03:50.890> that

00:03:51.060 --> 00:03:51.070 
because it doesn't really take up that

00:03:51.070 --> 00:03:52.920 
because it doesn't really take up that
much<00:03:51.430> room<00:03:51.670> because<00:03:52.480> it<00:03:52.600> doesn't<00:03:52.840> really

00:03:52.920 --> 00:03:52.930 
much room because it doesn't really

00:03:52.930 --> 00:03:54.630 
much room because it doesn't really
impede<00:03:53.290> as<00:03:53.500> I<00:03:53.620> said<00:03:53.800> on<00:03:53.920> your<00:03:54.040> normal<00:03:54.220> summer

00:03:54.630 --> 00:03:54.640 
impede as I said on your normal summer

00:03:54.640 --> 00:03:56.610 
impede as I said on your normal summer
but<00:03:55.150> it's<00:03:55.269> one<00:03:55.480> card<00:03:55.750> that<00:03:55.810> I<00:03:55.930> think<00:03:56.260> everyone

00:03:56.610 --> 00:03:56.620 
but it's one card that I think everyone

00:03:56.620 --> 00:03:59.150 
but it's one card that I think everyone
should<00:03:56.650> really<00:03:57.070> consider<00:03:57.250> and<00:03:57.850> one<00:03:58.570> that<00:03:58.840> I

00:03:59.150 --> 00:03:59.160 
should really consider and one that I

00:03:59.160 --> 00:04:02.580 
should really consider and one that I
you<00:04:00.160> know<00:04:00.190> quite<00:04:00.790> interested<00:04:01.510> and<00:04:01.690> in<00:04:01.989> testing

00:04:02.580 --> 00:04:02.590 
you know quite interested and in testing

00:04:02.590 --> 00:04:05.640 
you know quite interested and in testing
just<00:04:02.830> in<00:04:03.010> some<00:04:03.250> games<00:04:03.519> it's<00:04:04.150> actually<00:04:04.650> proving

00:04:05.640 --> 00:04:05.650 
just in some games it's actually proving

00:04:05.650 --> 00:04:07.410 
just in some games it's actually proving
to<00:04:05.830> be<00:04:05.860> a<00:04:05.950> little<00:04:06.220> bit<00:04:06.400> of<00:04:06.489> a<00:04:06.580> bothersome<00:04:07.150> card

00:04:07.410 --> 00:04:07.420 
to be a little bit of a bothersome card

00:04:07.420 --> 00:04:09.539 
to be a little bit of a bothersome card
for<00:04:07.630> a<00:04:07.660> lot<00:04:07.810> of<00:04:07.900> decks<00:04:08.110> as<00:04:08.350> I<00:04:08.799> said<00:04:08.980> life<00:04:09.220> swans

00:04:09.539 --> 00:04:09.549 
for a lot of decks as I said life swans

00:04:09.549 --> 00:04:11.130 
for a lot of decks as I said life swans
do<00:04:09.790> struggle<00:04:10.090> against<00:04:10.570> it<00:04:10.690> if<00:04:10.780> they<00:04:10.930> don't

00:04:11.130 --> 00:04:11.140 
do struggle against it if they don't

00:04:11.140 --> 00:04:12.900 
do struggle against it if they don't
have<00:04:11.320> their<00:04:11.470> outs<00:04:11.709> if<00:04:12.100> I<00:04:12.280> can<00:04:12.459> protect<00:04:12.820> that

00:04:12.900 --> 00:04:12.910 
have their outs if I can protect that

00:04:12.910 --> 00:04:15.930 
have their outs if I can protect that
card<00:04:13.299> it<00:04:13.840> does<00:04:14.170> win<00:04:14.500> me<00:04:14.709> some<00:04:14.739> games<00:04:15.459> obviously

00:04:15.930 --> 00:04:15.940 
card it does win me some games obviously

00:04:15.940 --> 00:04:18.900 
card it does win me some games obviously
it's<00:04:16.540> a<00:04:16.630> lot<00:04:16.780> more<00:04:16.959> useful<00:04:17.440> early<00:04:17.590> game<00:04:18.340> for

00:04:18.900 --> 00:04:18.910 
it's a lot more useful early game for

00:04:18.910 --> 00:04:20.240 
it's a lot more useful early game for
example<00:04:19.000> life<00:04:19.390> swans<00:04:19.750> get

00:04:20.240 --> 00:04:20.250 
example life swans get

00:04:20.250 --> 00:04:22.340 
example life swans get
then<00:04:20.910> they<00:04:21.239> already<00:04:21.480> have<00:04:21.750> the<00:04:21.870> names<00:04:22.110> in<00:04:22.260> the

00:04:23.810 --> 00:04:23.820 
grape for JD they already have

00:04:23.820 --> 00:04:26.000 
grape for JD they already have
attributes<00:04:24.390> for<00:04:24.570> the<00:04:24.630> BLS<00:04:25.020> the<00:04:25.260> cow<00:04:25.440> sorceress

or<00:04:26.220> whatever<00:04:26.640> it's<00:04:27.300> just<00:04:27.690> something<00:04:28.230> that<00:04:28.260> I

00:04:28.400 --> 00:04:28.410 
or whatever it's just something that I

00:04:28.410 --> 00:04:30.710 
or whatever it's just something that I
feel<00:04:28.740> is<00:04:29.040> one<00:04:29.460> that<00:04:29.820> should<00:04:30.270> be<00:04:30.540> really

00:04:30.710 --> 00:04:30.720 
feel is one that should be really

00:04:30.720 --> 00:04:32.690 
feel is one that should be really
considered<00:04:31.350> so<00:04:31.890> I<00:04:31.920> don't<00:04:32.220> know<00:04:32.280> what<00:04:32.430> you<00:04:32.550> guys

00:04:32.690 --> 00:04:32.700 
considered so I don't know what you guys

00:04:32.700 --> 00:04:34.370 
considered so I don't know what you guys
think<00:04:32.940> of<00:04:33.090> the<00:04:33.180> card<00:04:33.360> is<00:04:33.540> this<00:04:33.750> one<00:04:33.990> card<00:04:34.230> that

00:04:34.370 --> 00:04:34.380 
think of the card is this one card that

00:04:35.840 --> 00:04:35.850 
you've thought about before

00:04:35.850 --> 00:04:37.820 
you've thought about before
have<00:04:36.450> you<00:04:36.660> always<00:04:36.960> been<00:04:37.140> running<00:04:37.410> this<00:04:37.560> card
