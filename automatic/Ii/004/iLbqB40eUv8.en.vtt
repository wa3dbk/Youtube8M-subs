game<00:00:37.350> taking<00:00:37.770> the<00:00:37.920> turret<00:00:38.160> so<00:00:38.309> quickly<00:00:38.670> and

00:00:38.810 --> 00:00:38.820 
game taking the turret so quickly and

before<00:00:43.590> hunter<00:00:43.950> even<00:00:44.070> gets<00:00:44.340> up<00:00:44.489> there<00:00:44.640> and

00:00:44.779 --> 00:00:44.789 
before hunter even gets up there and

00:00:44.789 --> 00:00:46.520 
before hunter even gets up there and
then<00:00:45.239> shove<00:00:45.570> it<00:00:45.660> all<00:00:45.780> the<00:00:45.870> way<00:00:45.930> to<00:00:45.960> the<00:00:46.140> second

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:46.530 
then shove it all the way to the second

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:49.010 
then shove it all the way to the second
turret<00:00:47.370> there<00:00:47.640> what<00:00:47.940> that<00:00:48.120> does<00:00:48.390> is<00:00:48.600> create

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:49.020 
turret there what that does is create

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:50.240 
turret there what that does is create
pressure<00:00:49.170> on<00:00:49.350> the<00:00:49.440> opposite<00:00:49.770> side<00:00:49.980> of<00:00:50.039> the<00:00:50.129> map

00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:50.250 
pressure on the opposite side of the map

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:52.250 
pressure on the opposite side of the map
because<00:00:50.399> there's<00:00:50.730> a<00:00:50.789> triple<00:00:51.449> wave<00:00:51.660> stack<00:00:52.079> that

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:52.260 
because there's a triple wave stack that

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:54.139 
because there's a triple wave stack that
your<00:00:52.379> secondary<00:00:52.770> turret<00:00:53.160> presents<00:00:53.850> gravity

your secondary turret presents gravity

00:00:54.149 --> 00:00:56.569 
your secondary turret presents gravity

dying turret in the bottom lane and lose

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:02.360 
dying turret in the bottom lane and lose
three<00:01:00.870> waves<00:01:01.079> top<00:01:01.350> or<00:01:01.530> they<00:01:01.890> leave<00:01:02.039> them<00:01:02.190> top

three waves top or they leave them top

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:03.830 
three waves top or they leave them top
and<00:01:02.520> they<00:01:02.579> give<00:01:02.730> up<00:01:02.850> another<00:01:03.120> turret<00:01:03.570> which

00:01:03.830 --> 00:01:03.840 
and they give up another turret which

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:05.870 
and they give up another turret which
TSM<00:01:04.229> used<00:01:04.439> to<00:01:04.559> chain<00:01:04.830> through<00:01:05.250> the<00:01:05.430> early<00:01:05.549> game

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:05.880 
TSM used to chain through the early game

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:07.520 
TSM used to chain through the early game
then<00:01:06.240> their<00:01:06.420> mid<00:01:06.570> game<00:01:06.720> hand<00:01:07.049> off<00:01:07.200> after<00:01:07.500> that

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:07.530 
then their mid game hand off after that

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:09.140 
then their mid game hand off after that
was<00:01:07.740> a<00:01:07.770> little<00:01:07.890> bit<00:01:08.070> shaky<00:01:08.430> but<00:01:08.610> the<00:01:08.760> opening

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:09.150 
was a little bit shaky but the opening

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:10.490 
was a little bit shaky but the opening
was<00:01:09.270> really<00:01:09.510> good<00:01:09.659> yeah<00:01:09.990> there's<00:01:10.229> actually<00:01:10.470> a

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:10.500 
was really good yeah there's actually a

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:11.840 
was really good yeah there's actually a
bunch<00:01:10.650> of<00:01:10.770> interesting<00:01:10.950> theoretic<00:01:11.490> saan<00:01:11.820> the

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:11.850 
bunch of interesting theoretic saan the

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:14.480 
bunch of interesting theoretic saan the
the<00:01:12.390> Olaf<00:01:12.780> push<00:01:13.080> that<00:01:13.229> came<00:01:13.439> down<00:01:13.680> because<00:01:14.070> you

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:14.490 
the Olaf push that came down because you

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:15.950 
the Olaf push that came down because you
have<00:01:14.610> an<00:01:14.700> over<00:01:14.970> Senate<00:01:15.299> top<00:01:15.479> laner<00:01:15.689> without

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:15.960 
have an over Senate top laner without

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:17.960 
have an over Senate top laner without
flash<00:01:16.320> like<00:01:16.799> I<00:01:17.009> guess<00:01:17.159> his<00:01:17.340> teleport<00:01:17.790> might've

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:17.970 
flash like I guess his teleport might've

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:19.039 
flash like I guess his teleport might've
been<00:01:18.030> up<00:01:18.119> I<00:01:18.180> don't<00:01:18.240> member<00:01:18.479> at<00:01:18.570> the<00:01:18.600> time<00:01:18.840> but

00:01:19.039 --> 00:01:19.049 
been up I don't member at the time but

00:01:19.049 --> 00:01:21.320 
been up I don't member at the time but
like<00:01:19.430> pushing<00:01:20.430> really<00:01:20.580> far<00:01:20.820> down<00:01:20.850> like<00:01:21.180> that's

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:21.330 
like pushing really far down like that's

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:22.520 
like pushing really far down like that's
a<00:01:21.390> chant<00:01:21.659> that<00:01:21.720> can<00:01:21.869> be<00:01:21.930> gank<00:01:22.110> and<00:01:22.229> he<00:01:22.290> had<00:01:22.380> no

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:22.530 
a chant that can be gank and he had no

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:24.380 
a chant that can be gank and he had no
backup<00:01:22.860> from<00:01:22.979> Pearson<00:01:23.310> no<00:01:23.430> beggar<00:01:23.610> Santorin<00:01:24.270> I

backup from Pearson no beggar Santorin I

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:27.109 
backup from Pearson no beggar Santorin I
knocked<00:01:24.780> something<00:01:24.960> over<00:01:25.790> we're<00:01:26.790> good<00:01:26.970> though

00:01:27.109 --> 00:01:27.119 
knocked something over we're good though

00:01:27.119 --> 00:01:28.880 
knocked something over we're good though
uh<00:01:27.479> yeah<00:01:27.810> hit<00:01:28.020> nobody<00:01:28.170> from<00:01:28.439> his<00:01:28.530> team<00:01:28.680> but

only<00:02:52.260> Olaf<00:02:52.709> then<00:02:52.890> there<00:02:53.010> you<00:02:53.069> go<00:02:53.160> BAM<00:02:53.790> one<00:02:54.090> band

00:02:54.259 --> 00:02:54.269 
only Olaf then there you go BAM one band

00:02:54.269 --> 00:02:56.330 
only Olaf then there you go BAM one band
One<00:02:54.359> pick<00:02:54.599> that<00:02:54.959> is<00:02:55.109> one<00:02:55.319> option<00:02:55.530> I<00:02:55.890> think<00:02:56.129> that

00:02:56.330 --> 00:02:56.340 
One pick that is one option I think that

00:02:56.340 --> 00:02:58.789 
One pick that is one option I think that
even<00:02:56.670> if<00:02:57.060> they<00:02:57.180> do<00:02:57.239> decide<00:02:57.420> to<00:02:58.200> address<00:02:58.530> it<00:02:58.709> in

00:02:58.789 --> 00:02:58.799 
even if they do decide to address it in

00:02:58.799 --> 00:03:00.949 
even if they do decide to address it in
champ<00:02:59.040> select<00:02:59.370> you<00:02:59.700> have<00:02:59.910> to<00:03:00.090> address<00:03:00.329> the

00:03:00.949 --> 00:03:00.959 
champ select you have to address the

00:03:00.959 --> 00:03:03.199 
champ select you have to address the
lane<00:03:01.170> swap<00:03:01.440> advantage<00:03:02.310> that<00:03:02.430> I<00:03:02.489> got<00:03:02.819> because

00:03:03.199 --> 00:03:03.209 
lane swap advantage that I got because

00:03:03.209 --> 00:03:05.479 
lane swap advantage that I got because
whatever<00:03:04.109> champion<00:03:04.620> is<00:03:04.709> on<00:03:04.859> with<00:03:05.099> that<00:03:05.250> sort

00:03:05.479 --> 00:03:05.489 
whatever champion is on with that sort

00:03:05.489 --> 00:03:06.710 
whatever champion is on with that sort
of<00:03:05.549> advantage<00:03:05.819> it's<00:03:06.180> going<00:03:06.359> to<00:03:06.420> make<00:03:06.540> the

00:03:06.710 --> 00:03:06.720 
of advantage it's going to make the

00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:08.360 
of advantage it's going to make the
matchup<00:03:07.049> a<00:03:07.140> rough<00:03:07.290> for<00:03:07.530> Han<00:03:07.709> sir<00:03:07.920> and<00:03:08.099> two

00:03:08.360 --> 00:03:08.370 
matchup a rough for Han sir and two

00:03:08.370 --> 00:03:10.430 
matchup a rough for Han sir and two
honchos<00:03:08.700> credit<00:03:09.030> he<00:03:09.120> even<00:03:09.450> did<00:03:09.690> yeah<00:03:10.109> all

00:03:10.430 --> 00:03:10.440 
honchos credit he even did yeah all

00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:12.500 
honchos credit he even did yeah all
right<00:03:10.859> you<00:03:11.280> know<00:03:11.459> with<00:03:11.730> the<00:03:11.760> disadvantage

00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:12.510 
right you know with the disadvantage

00:03:12.510 --> 00:03:14.720 
right you know with the disadvantage
that<00:03:12.540> he<00:03:12.870> was<00:03:13.109> forced<00:03:13.620> to<00:03:13.769> eat<00:03:14.040> coming<00:03:14.549> out<00:03:14.700> of

00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:14.730 
that he was forced to eat coming out of

00:03:14.730 --> 00:03:17.240 
that he was forced to eat coming out of
the<00:03:14.940> lane<00:03:15.120> swap<00:03:15.390> he<00:03:15.840> still<00:03:16.260> was<00:03:16.829> able<00:03:16.950> to<00:03:17.129> do

00:03:17.240 --> 00:03:17.250 
the lane swap he still was able to do

00:03:17.250 --> 00:03:18.559 
the lane swap he still was able to do
Shen<00:03:17.459> things<00:03:17.730> yeah<00:03:17.970> you<00:03:18.030> know<00:03:18.209> we've<00:03:18.389> hammered

00:03:18.559 --> 00:03:18.569 
Shen things yeah you know we've hammered

00:03:18.569 --> 00:03:20.390 
Shen things yeah you know we've hammered
home<00:03:18.870> the<00:03:18.930> idea<00:03:19.440> that<00:03:19.500> both<00:03:19.829> of<00:03:19.859> these<00:03:20.099> teams

00:03:20.390 --> 00:03:20.400 
home the idea that both of these teams

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:22.490 
home the idea that both of these teams
are<00:03:20.669> looking<00:03:20.970> to<00:03:21.090> return<00:03:21.419> to<00:03:21.690> form<00:03:22.049> right<00:03:22.290> at

00:03:22.490 --> 00:03:22.500 
are looking to return to form right at

00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:24.229 
are looking to return to form right at
one<00:03:22.709> point<00:03:22.980> they<00:03:23.310> were<00:03:23.370> at<00:03:23.700> the<00:03:23.819> top<00:03:24.000> of<00:03:24.060> the

00:03:24.229 --> 00:03:24.239 
one point they were at the top of the

00:03:24.239 --> 00:03:26.960 
one point they were at the top of the
table<00:03:24.450> no<00:03:25.049> longer<00:03:25.500> for<00:03:25.709> gravity<00:03:26.190> what<00:03:26.730> that

00:03:26.960 --> 00:03:26.970 
table no longer for gravity what that

00:03:26.970 --> 00:03:30.050 
table no longer for gravity what that
was<00:03:27.269> was<00:03:27.500> really<00:03:28.549> innovative<00:03:29.549> champion<00:03:29.849> pics

00:03:30.050 --> 00:03:30.060 
was was really innovative champion pics

00:03:30.060 --> 00:03:31.729 
was was really innovative champion pics
or<00:03:30.299> out<00:03:30.480> of<00:03:30.569> the<00:03:30.630> box<00:03:30.840> champion<00:03:31.200> pics<00:03:31.410> and

00:03:31.729 --> 00:03:31.739 
or out of the box champion pics and

00:03:31.739 --> 00:03:34.520 
or out of the box champion pics and
innovative<00:03:32.489> early<00:03:32.970> game<00:03:33.150> strategy<00:03:33.720> well<00:03:34.139> here

00:03:34.520 --> 00:03:34.530 
innovative early game strategy well here

00:03:34.530 --> 00:03:36.140 
innovative early game strategy well here
they<00:03:34.560> got<00:03:34.829> beat<00:03:35.099> in<00:03:35.130> the<00:03:35.400> early<00:03:35.700> game<00:03:35.880> so<00:03:36.030> the

00:03:36.140 --> 00:03:36.150 
they got beat in the early game so the

00:03:36.150 --> 00:03:37.819 
they got beat in the early game so the
question<00:03:36.569> is<00:03:36.750> where<00:03:37.319> does<00:03:37.440> that<00:03:37.590> come<00:03:37.650> from

00:03:37.819 --> 00:03:37.829 
question is where does that come from

00:03:37.829 --> 00:03:39.710 
question is where does that come from
cop<00:03:38.250> is<00:03:38.459> that<00:03:38.730> something<00:03:39.180> that<00:03:39.209> they're<00:03:39.510> not

00:03:39.710 --> 00:03:39.720 
cop is that something that they're not

00:03:39.720 --> 00:03:42.680 
cop is that something that they're not
doing<00:03:40.019> pre<00:03:40.889> game<00:03:41.130> or<00:03:41.370> are<00:03:41.430> they<00:03:41.819> not<00:03:42.000> adjusting

00:03:42.680 --> 00:03:42.690 
doing pre game or are they not adjusting

00:03:42.690 --> 00:03:45.349 
doing pre game or are they not adjusting
well<00:03:42.720> to<00:03:43.139> the<00:03:43.889> circumstances<00:03:44.220> when<00:03:44.910> presented

00:03:45.349 --> 00:03:45.359 
well to the circumstances when presented

00:03:45.359 --> 00:03:46.819 
well to the circumstances when presented
with them<00:03:45.690> I<00:03:45.870> really<00:03:46.260> think<00:03:46.319> its<00:03:46.470> gravity<00:03:46.709> not

00:03:46.819 --> 00:03:46.829 
with them I really think its gravity not

00:03:46.829 --> 00:03:48.530 
with them I really think its gravity not
adjusting<00:03:47.340> to<00:03:47.519> what<00:03:47.849> their<00:03:48.030> team<00:03:48.209> is<00:03:48.359> like

00:03:48.530 --> 00:03:48.540 
adjusting to what their team is like

00:03:48.540 --> 00:03:51.650 
adjusting to what their team is like
right<00:03:48.750> now<00:03:48.900> for<00:03:49.079> example<00:03:49.250> TSM<00:03:50.269> return<00:03:51.269> to<00:03:51.450> form

00:03:51.650 --> 00:03:51.660 
right now for example TSM return to form

00:03:51.660 --> 00:03:53.110 
right now for example TSM return to form
by<00:03:51.750> being<00:03:52.019> good<00:03:52.049> but<00:03:52.410> what<00:03:52.500> they<00:03:52.560> did<00:03:52.709> was<00:03:52.829> they

00:03:53.110 --> 00:03:53.120 
by being good but what they did was they

00:03:53.120 --> 00:03:55.879 
by being good but what they did was they
gave<00:03:54.120> priority<00:03:54.540> to<00:03:54.840> dyrus<00:03:55.410> they<00:03:55.590> gave<00:03:55.739> him<00:03:55.829> a

00:03:55.879 --> 00:03:55.889 
gave priority to dyrus they gave him a

00:03:55.889 --> 00:03:57.289 
gave priority to dyrus they gave him a
champion<00:03:56.069> that<00:03:56.250> deserves<00:03:56.579> priority<00:03:57.000> gave<00:03:57.180> him

00:03:57.289 --> 00:03:57.299 
champion that deserves priority gave him

00:03:57.299 --> 00:03:59.539 
champion that deserves priority gave him
priority<00:03:57.750> he<00:03:58.079> does<00:03:58.260> well<00:03:58.470> TSM<00:03:58.859> reinvented

00:03:59.539 --> 00:03:59.549 
priority he does well TSM reinvented

00:03:59.549 --> 00:04:02.360 
priority he does well TSM reinvented
honestly<00:04:00.419> and<00:04:00.599> in<00:04:00.930> some<00:04:01.169> way<00:04:01.349> and<00:04:01.530> became<00:04:02.129> good

00:04:02.360 --> 00:04:02.370 
honestly and in some way and became good

00:04:02.370 --> 00:04:03.710 
honestly and in some way and became good
again<00:04:02.579> gravity<00:04:02.970> I<00:04:03.120> don't<00:04:03.480> think<00:04:03.510> I've

00:04:03.710 --> 00:04:03.720 
again gravity I don't think I've

00:04:03.720 --> 00:04:04.819 
again gravity I don't think I've
realized<00:04:04.109> that<00:04:04.319> they're<00:04:04.500> not<00:04:04.560> doing<00:04:04.769> very

00:04:04.819 --> 00:04:04.829 
realized that they're not doing very

00:04:04.829 --> 00:04:06.710 
realized that they're not doing very
well<00:04:05.040> anymore<00:04:05.250> like<00:04:05.819> I<00:04:05.940> don't<00:04:06.209> like<00:04:06.299> tristana

00:04:06.710 --> 00:04:06.720 
well anymore like I don't like tristana

00:04:06.720 --> 00:04:09.500 
well anymore like I don't like tristana
