00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.080
 hi guys next wanted to talk to 

00:00:01.650 --> 00:00:06.210
 you about preparing your car for the winter 

00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:08.960
 Well, what should I first turn to ? 

00:00:06.210 --> 00:00:12.389
 attention first you need to check your 

00:00:08.960 --> 00:00:14.549
 then battery seams do not count 

00:00:12.389 --> 00:00:18.480
 check how much your generator gives 

00:00:14.549 --> 00:00:18.930
 no load and full load and since 

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:22.350
 you see 

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:25.769
 well for that we need and connected here 

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:29.699
 and so here is a multimeter I have both 

00:00:25.769 --> 00:00:32.009
 because he is already 1288 is just fine but 

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:33.960
 he should like this more than his face value 

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:35.250
 Now we will start the cars 

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:37.050
 how much do we have this generator 

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:40.110
 generator immediately say yes you need to give 

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:42.360
 with a good charge of not less than 13 6 here 

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:44.780
 if less then this is already necessary 

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:47.280
 watch alternator replace brushes or 

00:00:44.780 --> 00:00:51.350
 something else but there I am different to him 

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:51.350
 little things with and so all start the car 

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:06.049
 and as you see in the wound up car 

00:01:03.089 --> 00:01:09.060
 I get a generator 14 1 

00:01:06.049 --> 00:01:13.250
 now we take and turn on the heating 

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:15.659
 rear window headlights front 

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:18.810
 fog light who has dipped 

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:21.799
 headlights and fan stove for full 

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:21.799
 power 

00:01:34.220 --> 00:01:42.590
 So to answer as yes, I turned it all on 

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:45.410
 me on my generator went charging well 

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:47.300
 norms and 13 6 is just norms plus 

00:01:45.410 --> 00:01:49.520
 turnover fell by 900 if turnover 

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:51.170
 will boost then the generator will issue 

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:56.120
 more charging but nothing is 

00:01:51.170 --> 00:02:00.050
 problem so look further on 

00:01:56.120 --> 00:02:03.080
 need to change the cooling system 

00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:06.020
 liquid well I pour antifreeze like this 

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:08.000
 here it is not our diluted it one to 

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:11.150
 if one is seen it stands 

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:13.459
 -35 degrees frost more than 20 

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:15.560
 degrees are not and this antifreeze and 

00:02:13.459 --> 00:02:17.540
 hugged him last year to change it is desirable 

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:19.670
 once every three years it is even more 

00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:22.640
 withstand the norm he will continue 

00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:24.590
 but it is necessary to keep it three times faster 

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:25.970
 change ambassador, I do not know no antifreeze 

00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:28.120
 users immediately had me with him 

00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:32.860
 problems if I contact further 

00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:36.350
 at the same time you can look at your 

00:02:32.860 --> 00:02:38.810
 gearbox what's your oil but nazim 

00:02:36.350 --> 00:02:40.700
 if you have a region, then we have a frost 

00:02:38.810 --> 00:02:44.480
 more than 30 degrees 35 and 

00:02:40.700 --> 00:02:47.030
 Well, even 20 is already better to put in the box 

00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:50.150
 butter is good so that it is bright with him 

00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:53.989
 it was like to tell you that in the winter she did not 

00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:55.880
 it was put not froze you were not 

00:02:53.989 --> 00:02:59.600
 difficult to include the transfer for this you need 

00:02:55.880 --> 00:03:01.400
 there were pure synthetics and good firms not 

00:02:59.600 --> 00:03:05.239
 contact our firms I would not 

00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:06.500
 He advised with domestic oil 

00:03:05.239 --> 00:03:09.019
 advertising only 

00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:10.700
 frost them it does not stand to tell you 

00:03:09.019 --> 00:03:14.480
 immediately familiar with this oil 

00:03:10.700 --> 00:03:16.400
 the problem is further well motor oil I personally 

00:03:14.480 --> 00:03:18.170
 pour semi-synthetics because we have a 

00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:20.540
 like i said over 20 play not 

00:03:18.170 --> 00:03:23.570
 It is cold here is such oil is 

00:03:20.540 --> 00:03:26.180
 Polish oil firm will tell you right away 

00:03:23.570 --> 00:03:28.489
 monk dollar for good and bad butter 

00:03:26.180 --> 00:03:31.100
 but if he will be very strong frost 

00:03:28.489 --> 00:03:34.880
 in order not to be rude to the motor better 

00:03:31.100 --> 00:03:36.850
 Pour the full synthetic is 5 to 45-50 35 

00:03:34.880 --> 00:03:39.470
 up to 40 is a very good butter but 

00:03:36.850 --> 00:03:41.750
 best quality oil but it is not 

00:03:39.470 --> 00:03:43.490
 advertising is ma bell Yeshe 

00:03:41.750 --> 00:03:44.810
 these are two firms that produce 

00:03:43.490 --> 00:03:50.420
 pretty good as well 

00:03:44.810 --> 00:03:53.060
 But such further if you have to 

00:03:50.420 --> 00:03:55.940
 your motor was playing faster 

00:03:53.060 --> 00:03:58.400
 just shut the grille well 

00:03:55.940 --> 00:04:00.380
 put or link the paper or the middle 

00:03:58.400 --> 00:04:02.510
 but the middle if will leave paper and 

00:04:00.380 --> 00:04:04.310
 it is not necessary to cover the entire radiator 

00:04:02.510 --> 00:04:06.680
 there is enough two thirds of the radiator 

00:04:04.310 --> 00:04:08.180
 one third and leave open and on 

00:04:06.680 --> 00:04:10.280
 if these give up here paper then 

00:04:08.180 --> 00:04:12.319
 close to the radiator and stand between 

00:04:10.280 --> 00:04:13.910
 radiator and paper you 

00:04:12.319 --> 00:04:15.349
 put under the grill should be 

00:04:13.910 --> 00:04:17.870
 space as if will not 

00:04:15.349 --> 00:04:19.729
 space or take a stub 

00:04:17.870 --> 00:04:21.709
 fully radiator then you can 

00:04:19.729 --> 00:04:22.940
 turn out so you overheat the motor 

00:04:21.709 --> 00:04:26.810
 just kill him 

00:04:22.940 --> 00:04:28.550
 but it is undesirable to do this and even such 

00:04:26.810 --> 00:04:30.650
 important fact you see my hood 

00:04:28.550 --> 00:04:32.270
 without insulation Iâ€™m not going to warm it 

00:04:30.650 --> 00:04:32.930
 since I had no problems in the winter 

00:04:32.270 --> 00:04:36.410
 a machine 

00:04:32.930 --> 00:04:39.950
 but at the same time you can insulate yourself a hood and 

00:04:36.410 --> 00:04:41.900
 put insulation and plus without Shumka 

00:04:39.950 --> 00:04:43.820
 we are from a very good thing I will tell you right away 

00:04:41.900 --> 00:04:46.970
 on an old car I had it all 

00:04:43.820 --> 00:04:49.280
 Well, the motor was in winter faster 

00:04:46.970 --> 00:04:51.050
 warms up and does not cool so quickly 

00:04:49.280 --> 00:04:52.640
 but on this machine I do not have but put 

00:04:51.050 --> 00:04:54.880
 I'm not going as we have 

00:04:52.640 --> 00:04:57.950
 there is no strong frost here all around 

00:04:54.880 --> 00:05:00.560
 it makes no sense my car 

00:04:57.950 --> 00:05:04.510
 but this winter was minus 10 not more 

00:05:00.560 --> 00:05:07.789
 so you see there is no point but these are 

00:05:04.510 --> 00:05:10.780
 important well what are the main aspects on 

00:05:07.789 --> 00:05:14.840
 which should pay attention in the winter 

00:05:10.780 --> 00:05:15.500
 when are you going to prepare the car 

00:05:14.840 --> 00:05:18.139
 for winter 

00:05:15.500 --> 00:05:20.139
 these are the main aspects that I tell you 

00:05:18.139 --> 00:05:22.970
 told if someone will that something 

00:05:20.139 --> 00:05:25.910
 incomprehensibly ask answer all your 

00:05:22.970 --> 00:05:27.350
 questions subscribe to my channel 

00:05:25.910 --> 00:05:31.150
 leave your comments put 

00:05:27.350 --> 00:05:31.150
 thumbs up all while you were with you
