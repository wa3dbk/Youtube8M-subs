00:01:36.689 --> 00:01:38.719 
their family over the course of about 50
years<00:01:36.990> I<00:01:37.259> won't<00:01:37.500> say<00:01:37.740> very<00:01:38.100> much<00:01:38.189> more<00:01:38.549> than

00:01:38.719 --> 00:01:38.729 
years I won't say very much more than

00:01:38.729 --> 00:01:40.520 
years I won't say very much more than
that<00:01:38.909> because<00:01:39.270> I<00:01:39.540> think<00:01:39.600> some<00:01:40.079> of<00:01:40.170> the<00:01:40.229> events

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:40.530 
that because I think some of the events

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:42.230 
that because I think some of the events
that<00:01:40.680> transpire<00:01:41.250> over<00:01:41.729> the<00:01:41.820> course<00:01:42.030> of<00:01:42.119> this

00:01:42.230 --> 00:01:42.240 
that transpire over the course of this

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:44.389 
that transpire over the course of this
book<00:01:42.299> are<00:01:42.750> quite<00:01:43.439> surprising<00:01:44.009> or<00:01:44.189> at<00:01:44.280> least

00:01:44.389 --> 00:01:44.399 
book are quite surprising or at least

00:01:44.399 --> 00:01:45.950 
book are quite surprising or at least
they<00:01:44.549> were<00:01:44.700> surprising<00:01:45.210> to<00:01:45.299> me<00:01:45.450> as<00:01:45.630> someone

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:45.960 
they were surprising to me as someone

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:47.480 
they were surprising to me as someone
who<00:01:46.110> didn't<00:01:46.439> really<00:01:46.649> know<00:01:46.829> much<00:01:47.130> more<00:01:47.310> than

very<00:02:27.239> often<00:02:27.569> in<00:02:27.689> books<00:02:27.930> so<00:02:28.260> that<00:02:28.409> being<00:02:28.590> said<00:02:28.680> I

00:02:28.849 --> 00:02:28.859 
very often in books so that being said I

00:02:28.859 --> 00:02:31.069 
very often in books so that being said I
had<00:02:29.189> a<00:02:29.219> very<00:02:29.489> high<00:02:29.730> expectation<00:02:30.540> going<00:02:30.750> into

00:02:31.069 --> 00:02:31.079 
had a very high expectation going into

had a very high expectation going into
this<00:02:31.200> book<00:02:31.500> and<00:02:31.799> part<00:02:32.040> of<00:02:32.159> me<00:02:32.280> also<00:02:32.459> knew<00:02:32.849> that

00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:33.150 
this book and part of me also knew that

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:34.490 
this book and part of me also knew that
this<00:02:33.299> book<00:02:33.510> could<00:02:33.689> never<00:02:33.870> really<00:02:34.079> live<00:02:34.349> up<00:02:34.469> to

00:02:34.490 --> 00:02:34.500

this book could never really live up to
the<00:02:34.709> expectations<00:02:35.400> that<00:02:35.459> I<00:02:35.549> had<00:02:35.819> so<00:02:36.329> I<00:02:36.359> think

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:36.510 
the expectations that I had so I think

00:02:36.510 --> 00:02:38.720 
the expectations that I had so I think
that<00:02:36.840> conflict<00:02:37.709> sort<00:02:37.950> of<00:02:38.040> influenced<00:02:38.519> the<00:02:38.609> way

00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:38.730 
that conflict sort of influenced the way

00:02:38.730 --> 00:02:40.970 
that conflict sort of influenced the way
I<00:02:38.760> read<00:02:39.329> this<00:02:39.480> book<00:02:39.719> I<00:02:39.989> will<00:02:40.319> say<00:02:40.499> I<00:02:40.530> really

00:03:14.479 --> 00:03:14.489 
will say that this is a story that isn't

00:03:14.489 --> 00:03:16.309 
will say that this is a story that isn't
really<00:03:14.879> like<00:03:14.909> super<00:03:15.659> action-packed

00:03:16.309 --> 00:03:16.319

obviously there are things that happen
but<00:03:19.859> this<00:03:20.310> doesn't<00:03:20.489> really<00:03:20.699> apply<00:03:20.909> driven

00:03:21.770 --> 00:03:21.780

00:03:49.039 --> 00:03:49.049 
Subash and sometimes you're seeing it

00:03:49.049 --> 00:03:50.300 
Subash and sometimes you're seeing it
happen<00:03:49.319> to<00:03:49.439> his<00:03:49.560> parents<00:03:50.009> and<00:03:50.069> sometimes

happen to his parents and sometimes

00:03:50.310 --> 00:03:52.009 
happen to his parents and sometimes
you're<00:03:50.579> seeing<00:03:50.819> it<00:03:50.909> from<00:03:51.030> Buddha<00:03:51.269> and<00:03:51.810> all

00:03:52.009 --> 00:03:52.019 
you're seeing it from Buddha and all

00:03:52.019 --> 00:03:53.659 
you're seeing it from Buddha and all
these<00:03:52.229> different<00:03:52.709> characters<00:03:53.189> you're<00:03:53.459> never

00:03:53.659 --> 00:03:53.669 
these different characters you're never

00:03:53.669 --> 00:03:56.179 
these different characters you're never
really<00:03:53.819> speaking<00:03:54.329> to<00:03:54.449> one<00:03:54.540> character<00:03:55.049> I<00:03:55.319> never

00:03:56.179 --> 00:03:56.189 
really speaking to one character I never

00:03:56.189 --> 00:03:59.240 
really speaking to one character I never
really<00:03:56.790> tend<00:03:57.090> to<00:03:57.299> love<00:03:57.599> that<00:03:58.259> writing<00:03:58.919> style

00:03:59.240 --> 00:03:59.250 
really tend to love that writing style

00:03:59.250 --> 00:04:01.099 
really tend to love that writing style
so<00:03:59.669> I<00:03:59.699> think<00:04:00.090> that<00:04:00.209> is<00:04:00.359> also<00:04:00.509> just<00:04:00.780> something

00:04:01.099 --> 00:04:01.109 
so I think that is also just something

00:04:01.109 --> 00:04:03.319 
so I think that is also just something
that<00:04:01.139> hindered<00:04:01.469> me<00:04:01.650> from<00:04:01.849> completely<00:04:02.849> loving

00:04:03.319 --> 00:04:03.329 
that hindered me from completely loving

00:04:03.329 --> 00:04:05.119 
that hindered me from completely loving
this<00:04:03.479> book<00:04:03.780> in<00:04:04.109> the<00:04:04.409> end<00:04:04.560> I<00:04:04.680> gave<00:04:04.769> this<00:04:04.919> book<00:04:05.069> a

00:04:05.119 --> 00:04:05.129 
this book in the end I gave this book a

00:04:05.129 --> 00:04:06.409 
this book in the end I gave this book a
three<00:04:05.340> and<00:04:05.430> a<00:04:05.489> half<00:04:05.639> out<00:04:05.790> of<00:04:05.819> five<00:04:05.909> stars<00:04:06.060> I

00:04:06.409 --> 00:04:06.419 
three and a half out of five stars I

00:04:06.419 --> 00:04:08.959 
three and a half out of five stars I
feel<00:04:06.629> like<00:04:06.959> reading<00:04:07.349> Jhumpa<00:04:07.739> Lahiri<00:04:08.069> is<00:04:08.159> still

00:04:08.959 --> 00:04:08.969 
feel like reading Jhumpa Lahiri is still

00:04:08.969 --> 00:04:11.809 
feel like reading Jhumpa Lahiri is still
worth<00:04:09.840> it<00:04:10.169> I<00:04:10.379> would<00:04:10.530> never<00:04:10.620> say<00:04:10.949> to<00:04:10.979> skip<00:04:11.549> any

00:04:11.809 --> 00:04:11.819 
worth it I would never say to skip any

00:04:11.819 --> 00:04:13.309 
worth it I would never say to skip any
of<00:04:11.909> the<00:04:12.030> books<00:04:12.299> and<00:04:12.599> I<00:04:12.840> definitely<00:04:13.049> don't

00:04:13.309 --> 00:04:13.319 
of the books and I definitely don't

00:04:13.319 --> 00:04:15.469 
of the books and I definitely don't
think<00:04:13.469> you<00:04:13.739> should<00:04:13.889> skip<00:04:14.099> this<00:04:14.310> one<00:04:14.370> but<00:04:15.060> again

00:04:15.469 --> 00:04:15.479 
think you should skip this one but again

00:04:15.479 --> 00:04:16.879 
think you should skip this one but again
if<00:04:15.689> you<00:04:15.810> haven't<00:04:16.079> read<00:04:16.349> any<00:04:16.560> of<00:04:16.590> her<00:04:16.739> books

00:04:16.879 --> 00:04:16.889 
if you haven't read any of her books

00:04:16.889 --> 00:04:18.409 
if you haven't read any of her books
before<00:04:17.159> I<00:04:17.340> wouldn't<00:04:17.849> recommend<00:04:18.060> starting

before I wouldn't recommend starting

00:04:18.419 --> 00:04:20.060 
before I wouldn't recommend starting
with<00:04:18.570> this<00:04:18.690> one<00:04:18.750> if<00:04:19.109> you<00:04:19.469> have<00:04:19.500> read<00:04:19.769> her<00:04:19.889> other

00:04:20.060 --> 00:04:20.070 
with this one if you have read her other

00:04:20.070 --> 00:04:21.030 
with this one if you have read her other
stuff<00:04:20.370> and<00:04:20.579> you<00:04:20.669> love
