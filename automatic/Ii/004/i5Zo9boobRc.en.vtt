00:00:10.300 --> 00:00:14.600
 hello hello with you axon and 

00:00:12.590 --> 00:00:16.880
 this issue evening for the world of tanks 

00:00:14.600 --> 00:00:19.820
 will be dedicated to such a premium tank 

00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:22.009
 level eight average t-54 first 

00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:24.230
 sample eighth level soviet union 

00:00:22.009 --> 00:00:26.840
 average so how long have everyone been waiting for this 

00:00:24.230 --> 00:00:28.610
 I didn't really expect that much 

00:00:26.840 --> 00:00:32.029
 I already had premium averages 

00:00:28.610 --> 00:00:33.890
 soviet union dvd mother tanks d4ea 

00:00:32.029 --> 00:00:37.790
 32 great cars 

00:00:33.890 --> 00:00:39.710
 A-32 is a great car here of course I bet 

00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:42.079
 no but matilda was terrible and here 

00:00:39.710 --> 00:00:43.489
 t-54 first sample appears first 

00:00:42.079 --> 00:00:46.609
 regular pis fours in itself 

00:00:43.489 --> 00:00:48.920
 nice tank and here she is also take on 

00:00:46.609 --> 00:00:51.769
 nothing like when something long 

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:53.359
 long ago we had this 54th on the eighth 

00:00:51.769 --> 00:00:56.809
 level she was premium she was 

00:00:53.359 --> 00:00:58.879
 narrow-eyed Chinese I mean type 59 

00:00:56.809 --> 00:01:00.260
 and than he then stood out correctly 100 

00:00:58.879 --> 00:01:03.230
 millimeters water 

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:05.750
 and nld and his strong spherical tower 

00:01:03.230 --> 00:01:08.240
 then nobody punched the gold was and 

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:10.340
 all that stuff and look write 

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:12.890
 the four that we have and especially 

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:14.450
 the first sample is 120 millimeters when i 

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:16.790
 saw the characteristics of this tank i 

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:19.370
 I realized that you need to take the tower 

00:01:16.790 --> 00:01:21.890
 by the way 160 millimeters in the mask punch 

00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:23.810
 not so just of scots and impossible 

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:26.330
 in general, therefore, in the frontal projection 

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:29.840
 this tank is a little vulnerable you understand now 

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:31.820
 goes out gradually not preferential and in a hurry 

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:34.160
 premium eighth level panther out 

00:01:31.820 --> 00:01:36.740
 88 and maxi 10 ct2 

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:38.660
 and t-54 the first sample of them of course 

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:40.700
 panther many may like but i dont 

00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:42.220
 I bought because it is not interesting to me 

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:45.080
 he has nothing unique gameplay 

00:01:42.220 --> 00:01:48.110
 mx cdc mad dynamics possesses i 

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:48.630
 bought a st2 piece smart just about shit 

00:01:48.110 --> 00:01:50.549
 maybe 

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:53.490
 but he's better a little bit of course than 

00:01:50.549 --> 00:01:55.680
 referral Tanchik here but still he 

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:57.869
 crap t-54 first sample and i bought 

00:01:55.680 --> 00:02:01.619
 just to talk because 

00:01:57.869 --> 00:02:03.990
 That t-54 ordinary 9 level 8 lesson tank 

00:02:01.619 --> 00:02:05.520
 okay and a tank of the eighth level well, if 

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:07.259
 he meets with eights forehead forehead 

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:09.750
 especially with benefits like challenge 

00:02:07.259 --> 00:02:12.030
 any or yonder stands jagdtiger 

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:14.040
 he just tanks them all instructor 

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:16.500
 punch armor 120 millimeters can 

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:18.480
 only on top of it is completely lucky even 

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:21.090
 podkalibera not necessarily breaks 

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:23.069
 this armor is just the forehead - podkaliber 

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:24.870
 destructor i.e. minor levels this 

00:02:23.069 --> 00:02:27.150
 the tank is just divinely tanchik and not 

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:28.890
 be sure to look very fine I 

00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:30.660
 I leave for a bunch of trunks here is true 

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:32.970
 artillery bad prokidykivat the place where 

00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:35.130
 standing house closes cards the same 

00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:38.099
 the bellhop remembered a bouquet just from everyone 

00:02:35.130 --> 00:02:40.260
 trunks and nothing else on the other hand 

00:02:38.099 --> 00:02:42.780
 this tank gun has almost the same 

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:44.610
 dpm like u like the usual 44 tower 

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:46.650
 rotate quickly Israel will turn away 

00:02:44.610 --> 00:02:49.860
 because it is obvious to me in the side of the tower here 

00:02:46.650 --> 00:02:52.380
 same damned but it's not about that 

00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:54.810
 the fact that dpm at the tank normal gun 175 

00:02:52.380 --> 00:02:56.640
 penetration of course the tank is slow but 

00:02:54.810 --> 00:02:59.190
 the secret first is the sabot shells 

00:02:56.640 --> 00:03:02.160
 if you really quite a strong opponent well 

00:02:59.190 --> 00:03:04.560
 if you like you can not strong butterfly 

00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:06.930
 worry about punching that is quite 

00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:08.760
 normal haircut on it can catch 

00:03:06.930 --> 00:03:10.829
 it is slower than type 59 

00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:13.109
 I have 59 on another account 

00:03:10.829 --> 00:03:14.910
 Of course slower but better dance 

00:03:13.109 --> 00:03:16.739
 certainly simply by interpretations 

00:03:14.910 --> 00:03:19.170
 really wanted a bunch of you in a hurry 

00:03:16.739 --> 00:03:21.090
 and not at the ninth level at 10 

00:03:19.170 --> 00:03:22.769
 seventh level because here still 

00:03:21.090 --> 00:03:24.210
 You can get to the six for them in 

00:03:22.769 --> 00:03:25.770
 principle not taken away 

00:03:24.210 --> 00:03:27.720
 that is, as you already understood, probably in 

00:03:25.770 --> 00:03:29.910
 top the machine is very good and for me 

00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:32.310
 from top to bottom pierces in order . good veins 

00:03:29.910 --> 00:03:33.990
 he doesn't twist the rod 

00:03:32.310 --> 00:03:35.880
 and there it is almost vertical for him 

00:03:33.990 --> 00:03:37.620
 servant to consider it is not always 

00:03:35.880 --> 00:03:39.030
 breaks though it annoys me 

00:03:37.620 --> 00:03:42.510
 a little bit but still it is not 

00:03:39.030 --> 00:03:44.130
 scary like this us 1300 plus tank 

00:03:42.510 --> 00:03:46.560
 Of course, if you hit 

00:03:44.130 --> 00:03:48.390
 farme if on goldie then of course he's in 

00:03:46.560 --> 00:03:50.490
 minus just wo n't go away even though I uploaded 

00:03:48.390 --> 00:03:52.260
 ammunition in half with dozens 

00:03:50.490 --> 00:03:55.530
 surely this tank is very hard 

00:03:52.260 --> 00:03:57.330
 play but on the other hand first these 

00:03:55.530 --> 00:03:59.370
 fights you can just squander forget how 

00:03:57.330 --> 00:04:00.780
 nightmare and secondly if you even 

00:03:59.370 --> 00:04:02.490
 there is someone for the tank and the type of someone 

00:04:00.780 --> 00:04:03.960
 cause damage too will be cool on 

00:04:02.490 --> 00:04:05.820
 in fact this is one of those tanks 

00:04:03.960 --> 00:04:08.970
 who are you playing in order to 

00:04:05.820 --> 00:04:11.550
 get into the top know it like pc 2g and he 

00:04:08.970 --> 00:04:14.100
 bends just anally pina 3 yells everyone 

00:04:11.550 --> 00:04:14.730
 triples but with fours it is useless 

00:04:14.100 --> 00:04:16.950
 here 

00:04:14.730 --> 00:04:19.410
 Well, not that straight at all useless 

00:04:16.950 --> 00:04:22.170
 damage can scribble 250 damage 

00:04:19.410 --> 00:04:24.630
 not the saddest dpm so mediocre 

00:04:22.170 --> 00:04:27.210
 quite for information stabilization him 

00:04:24.630 --> 00:04:29.640
 podrichtoval module world top of how to 

00:04:27.210 --> 00:04:31.320
 would you take great damage your 

00:04:29.640 --> 00:04:33.390
 armor for a dozen is not something 

00:04:31.320 --> 00:04:34.890
 ultimatum but if you can go 

00:04:33.390 --> 00:04:37.410
 on st direction you will meet there 

00:04:34.890 --> 00:04:40.050
 any other of 108 or even t8 

00:04:37.410 --> 00:04:42.960
 probably well of course t-34 does not count 

00:04:40.050 --> 00:04:44.460
 then you can scatter them in the studio us 

00:04:42.960 --> 00:04:46.260
 but i'm really just not afraid of 

00:04:44.460 --> 00:04:48.000
 I would make blueberries we fly unless 

00:04:46.260 --> 00:04:49.560
 can punch but no longer shoots 

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:52.410
 cumulative, he thinks I'm just like that 

00:04:49.560 --> 00:04:53.720
 normal tank and break through it 170 penetration 

00:04:52.410 --> 00:04:56.390
 basically enough moment 

00:04:53.720 --> 00:04:58.820
 I see the maenads fired 

00:04:56.390 --> 00:05:01.130
 you can go into the board the tank accelerates with 

00:04:58.820 --> 00:05:03.260
 mountains anyway he has more 

00:05:01.130 --> 00:05:04.760
 some advantages terrain that is, how 

00:05:03.260 --> 00:05:06.500
 really pleasant many will say that 

00:05:04.760 --> 00:05:09.050
 it is complicated and I agree because right away 

00:05:06.500 --> 00:05:10.820
 will be throwing all the time to tanks 10 

00:05:09.050 --> 00:05:12.980
 level naturally among them bend 

00:05:10.820 --> 00:05:14.900
 it will be extremely difficult but when you get 

00:05:12.980 --> 00:05:16.880
 eight probably it's just songs and 

00:05:14.900 --> 00:05:18.290
 fairy tale plus very little what farm and 

00:05:16.880 --> 00:05:19.970
 but it's not what I farm 

00:05:18.290 --> 00:05:22.700
 I ran out of armor piercing here 

00:05:19.970 --> 00:05:24.230
 shells very went sabot on 

00:05:22.700 --> 00:05:26.900
 this form and ends but he sleep 

00:05:24.230 --> 00:05:28.850
 dug 2,600 almost did not take damage well 

00:05:26.900 --> 00:05:32.180
 there a couple of random punch that me 

00:05:28.850 --> 00:05:33.080
 on top struck the Jagtigr in the side of the tower and this 

00:05:32.180 --> 00:05:35.030
 nld shot 

00:05:33.080 --> 00:05:36.710
 the royal tiger and he stood below 

00:05:35.030 --> 00:05:39.080
 so you know me, meldy was 

00:05:36.710 --> 00:05:40.790
 pretty open for him in general 

00:05:39.080 --> 00:05:42.260
 would look tank squat and average 

00:05:40.790 --> 00:05:44.150
 tank again from artillery no way 

00:05:42.260 --> 00:05:46.190
 suffers in order probably not much on 

00:05:44.150 --> 00:05:48.620
 her suffering, in principle, but not the essence and 

00:05:46.190 --> 00:05:53.300
 crush a trifle see what's left 

00:05:48.620 --> 00:05:55.669
 mxm 445 my gosh kv-85 what are you saying to me 

00:05:53.300 --> 00:05:57.530
 will heketh my god if he's not on 

00:05:55.669 --> 00:05:59.570
 his head and no chance at all yes 

00:05:57.530 --> 00:06:01.760
 and gold can not penetrate know the body 

00:05:59.570 --> 00:06:04.220
 54 this is the kind of thing i used to be on the test 

00:06:01.760 --> 00:06:06.860
 I rolled several times in a row case 50 

00:06:04.220 --> 00:06:09.710
 Fours did not break 130 with warm gold 

00:06:06.860 --> 00:06:12.200
 of course by the way here he threw a landmine 

00:06:09.710 --> 00:06:14.419
 I struck a pawn that's fuck you 

00:06:12.200 --> 00:06:16.400
 hrenovin to I did not understand where I have 

00:06:14.419 --> 00:06:17.120
 not worth any decals but me somewhere 

00:06:16.400 --> 00:06:20.060
 on the gap 

00:06:17.120 --> 00:06:22.070
 hellcat struck me somewhere but ok it 

00:06:20.060 --> 00:06:23.090
 Apparently let's say he can be random 

00:06:22.070 --> 00:06:25.250
 priests some very upright 

00:06:23.090 --> 00:06:27.200
 I did not notice the participant chorial gap 

00:06:25.250 --> 00:06:29.180
 the bottom line is that the tank is tanking 

00:06:27.200 --> 00:06:31.190
 man can poke at close range 

00:06:29.180 --> 00:06:33.440
 hull and tilt angle what else 

00:06:31.190 --> 00:06:35.960
 more will increase your chances of chances 

00:06:33.440 --> 00:06:38.900
 survival. Of course the Soviet inaccurate 

00:06:35.960 --> 00:06:41.270
 review let's say not so hot about what 

00:06:38.900 --> 00:06:43.190
 with 3 which hints us exactly that 

00:06:41.270 --> 00:06:45.770
 the tank must fight exclusively 

00:06:43.190 --> 00:06:47.840
 melee well it's obviously a warrior me 

00:06:45.770 --> 00:06:49.850
 here no one has 3400 damage it 

00:06:47.840 --> 00:06:51.740
 for some reason, our master did not have a tank 

00:06:49.850 --> 00:06:53.210
 too popular but he's good at 

00:06:51.740 --> 00:06:55.790
 In principle, probably not many with me 

00:06:53.210 --> 00:06:58.370
 agree it is not advertising straight tank 

00:06:55.790 --> 00:07:00.229
 honestly you can just count me 

00:06:58.370 --> 00:07:02.000
 freak who buys weird right on 

00:07:00.229 --> 00:07:03.740
 bought you for a unique gameplay and 

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:06.650
 Now I can clearly say that to me 

00:07:03.740 --> 00:07:08.599
 need type 59 to feel like you 

00:07:06.650 --> 00:07:10.940
 dancing on ice-t on the eighth level 

00:07:08.599 --> 00:07:12.979
 no, no, why do I have this one 

00:07:10.940 --> 00:07:15.710
 wonderful thing and I'll be on it 

00:07:12.979 --> 00:07:17.539
 fan purely for fan is not for farm and I 

00:07:15.710 --> 00:07:19.910
 I think you understand if you want 

00:07:17.539 --> 00:07:20.810
 pofarmit and if you say something rukasty 

00:07:19.910 --> 00:07:22.820
 mx cdc 

00:07:20.810 --> 00:07:26.300
 or fcm while he is still selling bedtime just 

00:07:22.820 --> 00:07:27.680
 more expensive and it just took off just 

00:07:26.300 --> 00:07:28.910
 video because i had a master with 

00:07:27.680 --> 00:07:30.710
 the other side if you liked that 

00:07:28.910 --> 00:07:32.479
