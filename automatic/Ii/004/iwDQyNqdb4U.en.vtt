00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.040
 educate tina the seal of education number 

00:00:02.730 --> 00:00:07.500
 one of Latin America let's continue 

00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:11.550
 practicing in this video the method for 

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:13.380
 move from decimal number to binary number 

00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:16.949
 in this case we are going to work with the 

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:21.050
 number 798 that we're going to want 

00:00:16.949 --> 00:00:21.050
 convert it from decimal 

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:25.070
 a binary 

00:00:27.020 --> 00:00:32.990
 for that we said that the method is to go 

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:34.520
 dividing the number by 2 

00:00:32.990 --> 00:00:37.160
 original as to each of the 

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:42.460
 results that we are getting in this 

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:46.970
 case 798 divided let's see that 7/2 

00:00:42.460 --> 00:00:54.170
 is we are going to use this color 7 and 22 stress 

00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:57.980
 we have 1 left we go down 9 19/2 is 9 we 

00:00:54.170 --> 00:01:02.320
 it remains 1 we went down the 8 and 18 it divided 2 

00:00:57.980 --> 00:01:04.940
 again it is 9 and we have 0 of the rest 

00:01:02.320 --> 00:01:12.710
 so well 

00:01:04.940 --> 00:01:16.390
 728 divided 2 is 399 with a rest 0 

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:20.360
 we divide now the 399 we divide it by 

00:01:16.390 --> 00:01:24.310
 23 divided is 1 we have 1 left down 

00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:28.050
 move 19 divided 29 

00:01:24.310 --> 00:01:32.590
 we are left 1 we lower the other 9 

00:01:28.050 --> 00:01:39.939
 and 19 divided again 9 we have 1 

00:01:32.590 --> 00:01:42.130
 finally 399 divided 2 is 199 with a 

00:01:39.939 --> 00:01:46.780
 unity 

00:01:42.130 --> 00:01:47.770
 well we keep dividing 199 divided 219 

00:01:46.780 --> 00:01:50.970
 divided 

00:01:47.770 --> 00:01:55.360
 it's 9 sorry 

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:58.120
 1919 I have one under 9 again 9 

00:01:55.360 --> 00:02:01.150
 here we are one we are pretty 

00:01:58.120 --> 00:02:04.890
 similar with all the numbers 199 

00:02:01.150 --> 00:02:10.350
 divided 2 is 99 with 1 of the rest 

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:11.710
 now 99 divided let's see that 9 

00:02:10.350 --> 00:02:19.810
 divided 2 

00:02:11.710 --> 00:02:22.069
 is 4 we are over 119/2 again is 9 and 

00:02:19.810 --> 00:02:25.489
 we have one of the rest 

00:02:22.069 --> 00:02:30.000
 we get then that 99 divided two is 

00:02:25.489 --> 00:02:33.480
 49 with 1 rest 

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:34.930
 we continue working in this case 49 

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:37.970
 divided 

00:02:34.930 --> 00:02:40.970
 4 of God 2 

00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:44.690
 we do not have anything left down the 99 

00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:47.930
 divided into 4 and we have one remaining 

00:02:44.690 --> 00:02:52.280
 we are already getting much more numbers 

00:02:47.930 --> 00:02:56.630
 nice 49 divided is 24 with 1 of 

00:02:52.280 --> 00:03:01.240
 rest and now yes 24 divided we know 

00:02:56.630 --> 00:03:01.240
 very good that is 12 with 0 of the rest 

00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:12.370
 now 12/26 also with 0 of the rest 

00:03:09.910 --> 00:03:17.750
 6 lived this are already much more accounts 

00:03:12.370 --> 00:03:22.700
 easy is 3 with zero of rest 

00:03:17.750 --> 00:03:26.330
 and 3/2 is one to put them in red is 

00:03:22.700 --> 00:03:31.550
 one with one of rest we do not have then 

00:03:26.330 --> 00:03:33.470
 that our binary number is in the 

00:03:31.550 --> 00:03:36.920
 indicated order that is from the 

00:03:33.470 --> 00:03:41.209
 result that we got to the last of 

00:03:36.920 --> 00:03:47.110
 way up we're going to have the 1 1 0 

00:03:41.209 --> 00:03:47.110
 0 0 1 1 1 

00:03:47.930 --> 00:03:57.710
 10 

00:03:50.860 --> 00:04:01.510
 in binary form that is going to be the 798 

00:03:57.710 --> 00:04:01.510
 in decimal form 

00:04:02.110 --> 00:04:08.470
 educational I recommend the following 

00:04:04.400 --> 00:04:08.470
 videos so you can keep learning
