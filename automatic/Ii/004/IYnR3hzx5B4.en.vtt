Montague it's a nineteen thousand BTU

00:03:08.409 --> 00:03:10.839 
Montague it's a nineteen thousand BTU
which<00:03:09.409> gives<00:03:09.680> it<00:03:09.799> plenty<00:03:10.040> of<00:03:10.129> firepower<00:03:10.430> to

00:03:10.839 --> 00:03:10.849 
which gives it plenty of firepower to

00:03:10.849 --> 00:03:13.660 
which gives it plenty of firepower to
get<00:03:10.970> a<00:03:11.000> nice<00:03:11.209> sear<00:03:11.569> on<00:03:11.750> the<00:03:11.870> steak

00:03:15.700 --> 00:03:15.710 
and I'm gonna cook this on each side for

00:03:15.710 --> 00:03:17.680 
and I'm gonna cook this on each side for
probably<00:03:15.980> three<00:03:16.250> or<00:03:16.280> four<00:03:16.370> minutes<00:03:16.940> the

00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:17.690 
probably three or four minutes the

00:03:17.690 --> 00:03:20.050
