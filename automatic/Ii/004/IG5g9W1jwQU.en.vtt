00:00:00.550 --> 00:00:01.486
 - Hey! 

00:00:01.207 --> 00:00:04.923
 - You know what? I'm in a "counting" mood today so ... 

00:00:05.666 --> 00:00:07.848
 - So ... I think I'll convert what I can. 

00:00:08.609 --> 00:00:10.495
 - Let me start with this box with COOKIES! 

00:00:10.544 --> 00:00:12.817
 - One box of cookies. 

00:00:14.526 --> 00:00:15.279
 - Yyy ... Ernie? 

00:00:15.139 --> 00:00:15.782
 -Yes? 

00:00:15.882 --> 00:00:19.830
 - I'm sorry, I've been going here and I've noticed that you said the word: 

00:00:19.876 --> 00:00:20.898
 COOKIES 

00:00:21.688 --> 00:00:25.031
 - That's right, I just said the word COOKIE because I just miscalculated this box of cookies. 

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:27.811
 - One box of cookies. 

00:00:27.594 --> 00:00:28.421
 - Mhm. And ... Ernie? 

00:00:29.257 --> 00:00:34.040
 - And now what are you going to do with this one box of cookies? 

00:00:35.469 --> 00:00:37.895
 - Well, I thought he would open it and count the cookies that are inside. 

00:00:38.220 --> 00:00:39.845
 - Oh ... And what then? 

00:00:40.821 --> 00:00:41.332
 - What's next...? 

00:00:41.332 --> 00:00:45.976
 - Yes yes ... what then ... What will you do when you have already converted cookies from the box? 

00:00:46.393 --> 00:00:49.319
 - Oh my ... I do not know! Do you have any ideas? 

00:00:49.319 --> 00:00:53.870
 - You mock me! Of course I have an idea! 

00:00:53.870 --> 00:00:58.654
 - I, Cookie Monster! I eat cookies from the box! Please! Please! Please! 

00:00:59.927 --> 00:01:01.161
 - Oh ... I had a feeling that you were going to say that. 

00:01:01.394 --> 00:01:04.923
 - Yes Yes. Please, Ernie, count the cookies so that I can eat cookies, please hurry up, hurry up! 

00:01:05.499 --> 00:01:06.734
 - OKAY. Let's count cookies. 

00:01:06.734 --> 00:01:07.477
 - Yes Yes Yes Yes! 

00:01:10.264 --> 00:01:11.378
 - Yes Yes Yes... 

00:01:11.378 --> 00:01:12.818
 - Oops. 

00:01:13.282 --> 00:01:16.765
 - What "Ups"? I hear somewhere "ups"? Who said "Oops"? Why? 

00:01:16.765 --> 00:01:17.694
 - I said "Oops." 

00:01:18.019 --> 00:01:18.809
 - Why? You? Why? 

00:01:18.994 --> 00:01:24.381
 - Well ... I just counted the cookies and the box is zero cookies. 

00:01:25.357 --> 00:01:26.750
 - Zero cookies in a box. 

00:01:27.028 --> 00:01:27.554
 - Yes. 

00:01:27.554 --> 00:01:29.490
 - Ok, that means you finished counting them, right? 

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:30.976
 - Yes, I finished counting. 

00:01:30.976 --> 00:01:34.598
 - Nice. Well. Thanks. Now I eat cookies, a box of cookies. 

00:01:34.877 --> 00:01:36.316
 - We start and ... 

00:01:39.056 --> 00:01:43.700
 - Wait ... wait ... Inside there are no cookies! Something's wrong here. 

00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:45.600
 - I know, Cookie Monster. 

00:01:46.208 --> 00:01:51.460
 - But Ernie ... You said that inside there is ZERO cookies in a box but there is NO cookies in the box! 

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:54.940
 - But it just means zero cookies. That means: there are no cookies. 

00:01:56.183 --> 00:02:05.710
 - Ya ... No cookies? It means that the box is ZERO cookies or NO cookies in the box, it means that ZERO or NO cookies in the belly of the cookie monster! 

00:02:06.502 --> 00:02:08.870
 - What do we do now? 

00:02:09.289 --> 00:02:10.680
 - Wait a moment, Cookie Monster ... just ... 

00:02:10.682 --> 00:02:11.840
 - It's a catastrophe! 

00:02:12.029 --> 00:02:13.560
 - No, no ... Calm down, calm down. 

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:14.910
 - There's something we can do about it. 

00:02:15.837 --> 00:02:17.230
 - Here is another box of cookies. 

00:02:17.601 --> 00:02:18.160
 - Oh! 

00:02:18.716 --> 00:02:22.060
 - So now we have: One ... Two boxes of cookies. 

00:02:22.524 --> 00:02:24.850
 - Ohoho ... O-open the box! Fast! Open! 

00:02:25.357 --> 00:02:25.590
 - OKAY. 

00:02:25.589 --> 00:02:26.470
 - I eat cookies from inside. 

00:02:28.004 --> 00:02:28.520
 - Oops. 

00:02:29.351 --> 00:02:32.280
 - Again, "Oops?" Why "Oops?" Last time it was a bad "Oops"! 

00:02:32.694 --> 00:02:33.620
 - Well ... so ... 

00:02:34.366 --> 00:02:34.830
 - No, not again ... 

00:02:35.574 --> 00:02:37.990
 - This box also has zero cookies inside, Cookie Monster. 

00:02:38.267 --> 00:02:40.310
 - No no no! Can not be! After-wait ... 

00:02:41.286 --> 00:02:41.940
 - Ernie! 

00:02:42.586 --> 00:02:43.840
 - No no no. After-wait a moment. 

00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:47.460
 - This box - has zero or no cookies inside ... 

00:02:47.648 --> 00:02:50.250
 - And this box - it has zero or ... 

00:02:50.249 --> 00:02:51.410
 ... no cookies inside. 

00:02:52.431 --> 00:02:55.640
 - Oh, Ernie! Do something quickly! I start going crazy. 

00:02:55.729 --> 00:02:57.730
 - Wait a second! Wait a moment, Cookie Monster! 

00:02:57.726 --> 00:02:58.240
 - I start going crazy! 

00:02:58.236 --> 00:02:59.440
 - I'm just remembering! 

00:02:59.630 --> 00:03:00.330
 - I start going crazy! 

00:03:00.326 --> 00:03:01.020
 - Do not start going crazy! 

00:03:01.301 --> 00:03:06.460
 - Wait a second! I took all the cookies from the boxes and put them in ... 

00:03:06.874 --> 00:03:07.520
 - This jar for cookies! 

00:03:07.524 --> 00:03:09.340
 - That's what I remembered, Cookie Monster. 

00:03:09.986 --> 00:03:10.260
 - So now... 

00:03:10.589 --> 00:03:13.560
 - All cookies are inside and I can count them! 

00:03:14.351 --> 00:03:15.190
 - Let's see ... I have ... 

00:03:15.698 --> 00:03:15.930
 - One! 

00:03:16.719 --> 00:03:17.560
 - One cookie ... 

00:03:17.880 --> 00:03:25.920
 - OM NOM NOM NOM! 

00:03:27.911 --> 00:03:28.890
 - Ccc-cookie Potworze? 

00:03:29.351 --> 00:03:30.650
 - I wanted to convert these cookies! 

00:03:30.977 --> 00:03:33.440
 - I am very sorry, Ernie, but I could not wait. 

00:03:33.856 --> 00:03:35.200
 - You can now convert these cookies. 

00:03:35.203 --> 00:03:36.040
 - Thanks. For now! 

00:03:36.828 --> 00:03:38.310

00:03:38.639 --> 00:03:40.780
 - So now ZERO cookies are really here. 

00:03:41.240 --> 00:03:42.220
 - You're wrong, Ernie! Bad, Bad. 

00:03:42.494 --> 00:03:43.380
 - I can see one more here. 

00:03:44.816 --> 00:03:45.700
 - Great! 

00:03:46.859 --> 00:03:49.090
