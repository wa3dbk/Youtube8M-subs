00:00:09.080 --> 00:00:09.090 
my name is David Lee Hoffman and I'm

00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:12.440 
my name is David Lee Hoffman and I'm
going<00:00:09.480> to<00:00:09.510> demonstrate<00:00:09.960> the<00:00:10.650> use<00:00:10.860> of<00:00:11.219> a<00:00:12.210> poor

00:00:12.440 --> 00:00:12.450 
going to demonstrate the use of a poor

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:16.599 
going to demonstrate the use of a poor
knife<00:00:13.370> the<00:00:14.370> pereire<00:00:14.759> knife<00:00:15.030> is<00:00:15.420> used<00:00:15.960> to

00:00:16.599 --> 00:00:16.609 
knife the pereire knife is used to

00:00:16.609 --> 00:00:19.550 
knife the pereire knife is used to
separate<00:00:17.609> the<00:00:17.670> leaves<00:00:18.060> from<00:00:18.359> the<00:00:19.050> compressed

00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:19.560 
separate the leaves from the compressed

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:23.480 
separate the leaves from the compressed
tea<00:00:19.859> to<00:00:20.490> make<00:00:20.670> them<00:00:20.850> easily<00:00:22.160> available<00:00:23.160> for

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:23.490 
tea to make them easily available for

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:28.939 
tea to make them easily available for
steeping<00:00:25.189> you<00:00:26.189> could<00:00:26.750> physically<00:00:27.750> break<00:00:28.650> off

00:00:28.939 --> 00:00:28.949 
steeping you could physically break off

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:32.120 
steeping you could physically break off
a<00:00:28.980> chunk<00:00:29.250> of<00:00:29.699> the<00:00:29.849> tea<00:00:30.090> in<00:00:30.539> many<00:00:30.810> cases<00:00:31.439> but

00:00:32.120 --> 00:00:32.130 
a chunk of the tea in many cases but

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:34.060 
a chunk of the tea in many cases but
what<00:00:32.309> they<00:00:32.489> like<00:00:32.669> to<00:00:32.700> do<00:00:33.000> in<00:00:33.149> China<00:00:33.480> is

00:00:34.060 --> 00:00:34.070 
what they like to do in China is

00:00:34.070 --> 00:00:36.440 
what they like to do in China is
separate<00:00:35.070> the<00:00:35.309> leaves<00:00:35.579> as<00:00:35.940> gently<00:00:36.329> as

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:36.450 
separate the leaves as gently as

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:39.020 
separate the leaves as gently as
possible<00:00:36.800> so<00:00:37.800> you're<00:00:38.010> not<00:00:38.160> really<00:00:38.520> breaking

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:39.030 
possible so you're not really breaking

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:42.350 
possible so you're not really breaking
the<00:00:39.390> leaves<00:00:39.629> you<00:00:40.079> are<00:00:40.550> separating<00:00:41.550> them<00:00:41.760> so

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:42.360 
the leaves you are separating them so

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:44.000 
the leaves you are separating them so
when<00:00:42.719> you<00:00:42.870> steep<00:00:43.200> them<00:00:43.469> you<00:00:43.649> could<00:00:43.800> actually

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:44.010 
when you steep them you could actually

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:47.690 
when you steep them you could actually
see<00:00:44.910> the<00:00:45.239> Leafs<00:00:45.780> in<00:00:46.200> in<00:00:46.559> the<00:00:46.710> cup<00:00:46.920> not<00:00:47.250> a<00:00:47.309> lot<00:00:47.550> of

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:47.700 
see the Leafs in in the cup not a lot of

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:50.630 
see the Leafs in in the cup not a lot of
broken<00:00:48.059> pieces<00:00:48.350> so<00:00:49.350> that's<00:00:49.559> why<00:00:49.829> you<00:00:50.460> never

00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:50.640 
broken pieces so that's why you never

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:53.689 
broken pieces so that's why you never
jab<00:00:51.539> at<00:00:51.870> it<00:00:51.899> like<00:00:52.289> this<00:00:52.590> to<00:00:52.829> break<00:00:53.039> it<00:00:53.250> up<00:00:53.399> but

00:00:53.689 --> 00:00:53.699 
jab at it like this to break it up but

00:00:53.699 --> 00:00:57.080 
jab at it like this to break it up but
you<00:00:54.420> try<00:00:54.719> and<00:00:54.870> work<00:00:55.140> in<00:00:55.559> from<00:00:56.160> the<00:00:56.190> edge<00:00:56.489> to

00:00:57.080 --> 00:00:57.090 
you try and work in from the edge to

00:00:57.090 --> 00:01:00.560 
you try and work in from the edge to
separate<00:00:57.750> the<00:00:57.989> leaves<00:00:58.280> so<00:00:59.280> it<00:00:59.699> does<00:01:00.120> less

00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:00.570 
separate the leaves so it does less

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:05.840 
separate the leaves so it does less
damage<00:01:00.600> to<00:01:01.500> the<00:01:01.620> leaf<00:01:01.829> itself<00:01:02.870> the<00:01:04.549> first<00:01:05.549> one

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:05.850 
damage to the leaf itself the first one

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:10.300 
damage to the leaf itself the first one
will<00:01:06.150> be<00:01:06.180> a<00:01:06.830> bamboo<00:01:07.830> fragrance<00:01:08.430> puer<00:01:08.990> and

00:01:10.300 --> 00:01:10.310 
will be a bamboo fragrance puer and

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:14.420 
will be a bamboo fragrance puer and
there's<00:01:11.310> actually<00:01:11.810> three<00:01:12.810> ways<00:01:12.840> of<00:01:13.530> removing

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:14.430 
there's actually three ways of removing

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:16.550 
there's actually three ways of removing
the<00:01:14.790> tea<00:01:14.970> from<00:01:15.330> this<00:01:15.540> there's<00:01:16.049> probably<00:01:16.350> more

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:16.560 
the tea from this there's probably more

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:19.370 
the tea from this there's probably more
ways<00:01:16.830> but<00:01:17.130> I<00:01:17.159> could<00:01:17.400> think<00:01:17.549> of<00:01:17.729> three<00:01:18.380> the

00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:19.380 
ways but I could think of three the

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:23.780 
ways but I could think of three the
first<00:01:19.650> is<00:01:19.979> to<00:01:20.369> tap<00:01:21.299> it<00:01:21.479> down<00:01:21.689> on<00:01:22.400> a<00:01:23.400> hard

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:23.790 
first is to tap it down on a hard

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:27.350 
first is to tap it down on a hard
surface<00:01:24.119> and<00:01:24.689> try<00:01:24.900> and<00:01:25.080> move<00:01:25.409> the<00:01:26.070> tea<00:01:26.310> down<00:01:27.030> to

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:27.360 
surface and try and move the tea down to

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:31.870 
surface and try and move the tea down to
the<00:01:27.479> end<00:01:27.750> and<00:01:28.049> then<00:01:28.710> work<00:01:29.670> it<00:01:29.850> out<00:01:30.030> this<00:01:30.810> way

00:01:31.870 --> 00:01:31.880 
the end and then work it out this way

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:35.719 
the end and then work it out this way
that<00:01:32.880> is<00:01:33.119> nice<00:01:33.420> because<00:01:33.840> you<00:01:34.290> could<00:01:34.500> keep<00:01:35.070> the

00:01:35.719 --> 00:01:35.729 
that is nice because you could keep the

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:38.749 
that is nice because you could keep the
bamboo<00:01:36.150> container<00:01:36.900> intact<00:01:37.650> but<00:01:38.369> you<00:01:38.520> can't

00:01:38.749 --> 00:01:38.759 
bamboo container intact but you can't

00:01:38.759 --> 00:01:41.420 
bamboo container intact but you can't
always<00:01:38.939> do<00:01:39.540> it<00:01:39.570> that<00:01:39.869> way<00:01:40.110> what<00:01:40.860> they<00:01:40.979> do<00:01:41.040> more

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:41.430 
always do it that way what they do more

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:45.499 
always do it that way what they do more
often<00:01:41.880> in<00:01:42.060> China<00:01:42.420> is<00:01:42.750> to<00:01:43.250> take<00:01:44.250> a<00:01:44.579> knife<00:01:45.149> or<00:01:45.479> a

00:01:45.499 --> 00:01:45.509 
often in China is to take a knife or a

00:01:45.509 --> 00:01:46.280 
often in China is to take a knife or a
cleaver

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:46.290 
cleaver

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:51.010 
cleaver
I've<00:01:46.860> got<00:01:47.159> a<00:01:47.189> Japanese<00:01:48.000> cleaver<00:01:48.420> here<00:01:48.810> and<00:01:49.610> I

00:01:51.010 --> 00:01:51.020 
I've got a Japanese cleaver here and I

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:53.749 
I've got a Japanese cleaver here and I
might<00:01:52.020> be<00:01:52.170> able<00:01:52.259> to<00:01:52.409> do<00:01:52.710> it<00:01:52.890> on<00:01:53.070> the<00:01:53.280> table

00:01:53.749 --> 00:01:53.759 
might be able to do it on the table

00:01:53.759 --> 00:01:55.819 
might be able to do it on the table
haribol<00:01:54.210> I'm<00:01:54.689> going<00:01:54.840> to<00:01:54.899> try<00:01:55.140> without<00:01:55.350> trying

00:01:55.819 --> 00:01:55.829 
haribol I'm going to try without trying

00:01:55.829 --> 00:02:00.529 
haribol I'm going to try without trying
to<00:01:56.009> break<00:01:56.880> up<00:01:57.439> too<00:01:58.439> much

00:02:00.529 --> 00:02:00.539 
to break up too much

00:02:00.539 --> 00:02:05.160 
to break up too much
so<00:02:01.539> I'm<00:02:01.810> going<00:02:02.110> to<00:02:02.369> put<00:02:03.369> it<00:02:03.600> well<00:02:04.600> I'll<00:02:04.810> put<00:02:05.049> it

00:02:05.160 --> 00:02:05.170 
so I'm going to put it well I'll put it

00:02:05.170 --> 00:02:07.020 
so I'm going to put it well I'll put it
halfway<00:02:05.500> through<00:02:05.770> there's<00:02:06.369> another<00:02:06.640> way<00:02:06.880> of

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:07.030 
halfway through there's another way of

00:02:07.030 --> 00:02:09.210 
halfway through there's another way of
doing<00:02:07.240> it<00:02:07.509> where<00:02:07.750> you<00:02:07.899> can<00:02:08.080> take<00:02:08.379> a<00:02:08.410> saw<00:02:08.860> and

00:02:09.210 --> 00:02:09.220 
doing it where you can take a saw and

00:02:09.220 --> 00:02:12.900 
doing it where you can take a saw and
cut<00:02:10.260> about<00:02:11.260> a<00:02:11.290> third<00:02:11.739> of<00:02:11.890> the<00:02:12.010> way<00:02:12.190> through<00:02:12.220> the

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:12.910 
cut about a third of the way through the

00:02:12.910 --> 00:02:17.300 
cut about a third of the way through the
bamboo<00:02:13.120> and<00:02:13.780> then<00:02:14.500> you<00:02:14.769> split<00:02:15.610> the<00:02:15.879> edge<00:02:16.150> and

00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:17.310 
bamboo and then you split the edge and

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:21.059 
bamboo and then you split the edge and
just<00:02:18.310> that<00:02:18.640> one<00:02:18.880> section<00:02:19.750> will<00:02:20.260> remove<00:02:20.709> and

00:02:21.059 --> 00:02:21.069 
just that one section will remove and

00:02:21.069 --> 00:02:24.890 
just that one section will remove and
then<00:02:21.489> you<00:02:21.640> have<00:02:21.790> access<00:02:22.450> to<00:02:22.480> the<00:02:22.810> tea<00:02:23.019> in<00:02:23.140> there

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:24.900 
then you have access to the tea in there

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:34.589 
then you have access to the tea in there
so<00:02:25.900> I<00:02:26.230> will<00:02:26.519> try<00:02:27.519> and<00:02:27.760> do<00:02:27.940> it<00:02:28.090> about<00:02:28.330> half<00:02:33.599> okay

00:02:34.589 --> 00:02:34.599 
so I will try and do it about half okay

00:02:34.599 --> 00:02:35.729 
so I will try and do it about half okay
we<00:02:34.810> made<00:02:35.049> the<00:02:35.200> cut

00:02:35.729 --> 00:02:35.739 
we made the cut

00:02:35.739 --> 00:02:41.160 
we made the cut
I'm<00:02:36.040> going<00:02:36.400> to<00:02:36.610> twist<00:02:37.000> it<00:02:37.299> and<00:02:39.750> now<00:02:40.750> you<00:02:40.810> can

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:41.170 
I'm going to twist it and now you can

00:02:41.170 --> 00:02:47.160 
I'm going to twist it and now you can
see<00:02:41.440> we<00:02:41.709> can<00:02:42.209> separate<00:02:44.970> the<00:02:45.970> two<00:02:46.299> halves<00:02:46.750> quite

00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:47.170 
see we can separate the two halves quite

00:02:47.170 --> 00:02:50.930 
see we can separate the two halves quite
easily<00:02:48.030> now<00:02:49.030> once<00:02:49.599> you're<00:02:49.900> at<00:02:50.230> this<00:02:50.470> point

00:02:50.930 --> 00:02:50.940 
easily now once you're at this point

00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:53.789 
easily now once you're at this point
then<00:02:51.940> it<00:02:52.120> becomes<00:02:52.510> quite<00:02:52.870> easy<00:02:53.140> and<00:02:53.410> you<00:02:53.590> could

00:02:53.789 --> 00:02:53.799 
then it becomes quite easy and you could

00:02:53.799 --> 00:02:57.300 
then it becomes quite easy and you could
see<00:02:54.099> when<00:02:55.060> they<00:02:55.450> pack<00:02:56.349> the<00:02:56.590> tea<00:02:56.799> when<00:02:57.130> it's

00:02:57.300 --> 00:02:57.310 
see when they pack the tea when it's

00:02:57.310 --> 00:03:01.680 
see when they pack the tea when it's
fresh<00:02:57.670> the<00:02:58.390> bamboo<00:02:59.019> is<00:02:59.380> green<00:02:59.890> and<00:03:00.329> very<00:03:01.329> fresh

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:01.690 
fresh the bamboo is green and very fresh

00:03:01.690 --> 00:03:05.699 
fresh the bamboo is green and very fresh
so<00:03:02.470> the<00:03:02.829> bamboo<00:03:03.519> itself<00:03:03.940> imparts<00:03:04.810> a<00:03:05.049> fragrance

00:03:05.699 --> 00:03:05.709 
so the bamboo itself imparts a fragrance

00:03:05.709 --> 00:03:07.650 
so the bamboo itself imparts a fragrance
to<00:03:05.859> the<00:03:06.010> tea<00:03:06.310> that's<00:03:06.940> why<00:03:07.150> they<00:03:07.299> call<00:03:07.480> this

00:03:07.650 --> 00:03:07.660 
to the tea that's why they call this

00:03:07.660 --> 00:03:12.360 
to the tea that's why they call this
bamboo<00:03:08.190> fragrant<00:03:09.190> spore<00:03:09.959> so<00:03:10.980> okay<00:03:11.980> now<00:03:12.010> we've

00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:12.370 
bamboo fragrant spore so okay now we've

00:03:12.370 --> 00:03:15.509 
bamboo fragrant spore so okay now we've
got<00:03:12.609> the<00:03:12.819> tea<00:03:13.090> separated<00:03:13.959> and<00:03:14.109> again<00:03:14.950> the<00:03:15.250> leaf

00:03:15.509 --> 00:03:15.519 
got the tea separated and again the leaf

00:03:15.519 --> 00:03:18.960 
got the tea separated and again the leaf
is<00:03:15.819> compressed<00:03:16.540> this<00:03:17.109> way<00:03:17.380> so<00:03:18.250> I'm<00:03:18.489> going<00:03:18.819> to

00:03:18.960 --> 00:03:18.970 
is compressed this way so I'm going to

00:03:18.970 --> 00:03:22.680 
is compressed this way so I'm going to
go<00:03:19.150> over<00:03:19.180> here<00:03:19.780> and<00:03:20.220> break<00:03:21.220> out<00:03:21.489> about<00:03:22.209> five

00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:22.690

grams<00:03:23.170> of<00:03:23.560> tea<00:03:23.799> just<00:03:24.190> loosen<00:03:24.880> it<00:03:24.910> up<00:03:25.120> a<00:03:25.329> little

00:03:25.500 --> 00:03:25.510 
grams of tea just loosen it up a little

00:03:25.510 --> 00:03:29.759 
grams of tea just loosen it up a little
bit<00:03:25.780> and<00:03:26.709> now<00:03:27.579> I'm<00:03:27.700> going<00:03:28.030> to<00:03:28.239> place<00:03:29.049> it<00:03:29.350> in<00:03:29.590> the

00:03:29.759 --> 00:03:29.769 
bit and now I'm going to place it in the

00:03:29.769 --> 00:03:37.620 
bit and now I'm going to place it in the
guy<00:03:29.950> one<00:03:30.540> will<00:03:31.540> do<00:03:31.750> a<00:03:31.780> little<00:03:32.139> bit<00:03:32.380> more<00:03:36.630> okay
