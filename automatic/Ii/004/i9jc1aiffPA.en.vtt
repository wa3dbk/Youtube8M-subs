what when you're using you know using a

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:05.539 
what when you're using you know using a

00:02:08.089 --> 00:02:08.099 
better audio quality so that is how you

00:02:08.099 --> 00:02:12.050 
better audio quality so that is how you
use<00:02:08.220> a<00:02:08.489> microphone<00:02:09.090> with<00:02:09.509> a<00:02:09.690> video<00:02:09.989> camera
