answers<00:00:54.510> that<00:00:54.930> question<00:00:55.170> and<00:00:55.710> actually<00:00:56.370> I

00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:56.610 
answers that question and actually I

00:00:56.610 --> 00:01:00.229 
answers that question and actually I
think<00:00:56.730> that<00:00:57.059> there<00:00:57.300> are<00:00:57.449> five<00:00:58.430> five<00:00:59.430> points

00:01:00.229 --> 00:01:00.239 
think that there are five five points

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:03.439 
think that there are five five points
that<00:01:00.270> we<00:01:00.660> can<00:01:01.309> put<00:01:02.309> down<00:01:02.489> in<00:01:02.670> our<00:01:02.820> mind<00:01:03.180> that

00:01:03.439 --> 00:01:03.449 
that we can put down in our mind that

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:07.160 
that we can put down in our mind that
will<00:01:04.320> tell<00:01:04.949> us<00:01:05.159> when<00:01:06.090> this<00:01:06.240> event<00:01:06.630> will<00:01:06.960> take

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:07.170 
will tell us when this event will take

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:09.219 
will tell us when this event will take
place<00:01:07.229> and<00:01:07.770> whether<00:01:08.130> or<00:01:08.340> not<00:01:08.490> we<00:01:08.909> will

00:01:09.219 --> 00:01:09.229 
place and whether or not we will

00:01:09.229 --> 00:01:12.770 
place and whether or not we will
experience<00:01:10.430> the<00:01:11.430> wrath<00:01:11.640> of<00:01:11.880> God<00:01:12.119> and<00:01:12.390> the

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:12.780 
experience the wrath of God and the

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:15.740 
experience the wrath of God and the
