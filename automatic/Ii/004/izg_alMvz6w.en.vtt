because<00:00:02.370> because<00:00:02.610> plastic<00:00:02.879> is<00:00:03.179> made<00:00:03.360> up<00:00:03.510> of

00:00:03.530 --> 00:00:03.540 
because because plastic is made up of

00:00:03.540 --> 00:00:06.289 
because because plastic is made up of
these<00:00:03.720> chain<00:00:04.319> like<00:00:04.620> very<00:00:05.100> very<00:00:05.400> low<00:00:05.670> molecules

00:00:06.289 --> 00:00:06.299 
these chain like very very low molecules

00:00:06.299 --> 00:00:08.629 
these chain like very very low molecules
which<00:00:06.450> all<00:00:06.600> kind<00:00:06.870> of<00:00:06.930> intermingle<00:00:07.639> imagine

00:00:08.629 --> 00:00:08.639 
which all kind of intermingle imagine

00:00:08.639 --> 00:00:10.370 
which all kind of intermingle imagine
something<00:00:08.849> like<00:00:08.970> really<00:00:09.780> long<00:00:10.080> hair<00:00:10.349> that

00:00:10.370 --> 00:00:10.380 
something like really long hair that

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:12.499 
something like really long hair that
gets<00:00:10.650> bit<00:00:10.920> sort<00:00:11.130> of<00:00:11.160> matted<00:00:11.730> and<00:00:11.820> tangled<00:00:11.910> it's

00:00:12.499 --> 00:00:12.509 
gets bit sort of matted and tangled it's

00:00:12.509 --> 00:00:14.450 
gets bit sort of matted and tangled it's
very<00:00:12.719> very<00:00:12.900> difficult<00:00:13.139> to<00:00:13.440> separate<00:00:13.830> and

00:00:14.450 --> 00:00:14.460 
very very difficult to separate and

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:15.530 
very very difficult to separate and
that's<00:00:14.580> a<00:00:14.670> bit<00:00:14.790> like<00:00:14.849> the<00:00:14.969> plastic<00:00:15.389> and<00:00:15.480> the

00:00:15.530 --> 00:00:15.540 
that's a bit like the plastic and the

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:17.120 
that's a bit like the plastic and the
problem<00:00:15.870> is<00:00:15.990> there's<00:00:16.230> nothing<00:00:16.379> that's

00:00:17.120 --> 00:00:17.130 
problem is there's nothing that's

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:18.740 
problem is there's nothing that's
actually<00:00:17.430> evolved<00:00:17.940> it<00:00:18.060> can<00:00:18.180> break<00:00:18.449> these

00:00:18.740 --> 00:00:18.750 
actually evolved it can break these

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:20.540 
actually evolved it can break these
molecules<00:00:19.289> down<00:00:19.590> so<00:00:20.279> it<00:00:20.400> all<00:00:20.520> just

00:00:20.540 --> 00:00:20.550 
molecules down so it all just

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:23.210 
molecules down so it all just
accumulates<00:00:21.539> much<00:00:22.170> of<00:00:22.350> it<00:00:22.470> ending<00:00:22.859> up<00:00:22.949> in<00:00:23.070> our

00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:23.220 
accumulates much of it ending up in our

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:26.359 
accumulates much of it ending up in our
oceans<00:00:23.670> in<00:00:24.420> fact<00:00:24.720> there<00:00:25.019> are<00:00:25.140> over<00:00:25.369> 40,000

00:00:26.359 --> 00:00:26.369 
oceans in fact there are over 40,000

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:28.429 
oceans in fact there are over 40,000
bits<00:00:26.550> of<00:00:26.699> plastic<00:00:27.090> or<00:00:27.390> a<00:00:27.449> square<00:00:27.810> mile

00:00:28.429 --> 00:00:28.439 
bits of plastic or a square mile

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:30.589 
bits of plastic or a square mile
this<00:00:29.039> holds<00:00:29.369> water<00:00:29.550> the<00:00:29.820> Pacific<00:00:30.300> you<00:00:30.420> look

00:00:30.589 --> 00:00:30.599 
this holds water the Pacific you look

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:32.630 
this holds water the Pacific you look
like<00:00:30.779> a<00:00:30.810> sort<00:00:31.019> of<00:00:31.080> plastic<00:00:31.590> seat<00:00:31.830> because<00:00:32.520> it

00:00:32.630 --> 00:00:32.640 
like a sort of plastic seat because it

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:34.370 
like a sort of plastic seat because it
is<00:00:32.759> big<00:00:33.030> bits<00:00:33.300> obviously<00:00:33.719> but<00:00:33.870> most<00:00:34.079> of<00:00:34.170> its

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:34.380 
is big bits obviously but most of its

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:36.500 
is big bits obviously but most of its
microscopic<00:00:35.040> but<00:00:35.880> even<00:00:36.030> these<00:00:36.090> big<00:00:36.329> better

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:36.510 
microscopic but even these big better

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:38.090 
microscopic but even these big better
going<00:00:36.690> to<00:00:36.750> break<00:00:36.960> down<00:00:36.989> smaller<00:00:37.620> and<00:00:37.800> smaller

00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:38.100 
going to break down smaller and smaller

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:39.889 
going to break down smaller and smaller
but<00:00:38.550> the<00:00:38.640> thing<00:00:38.850> is<00:00:38.879> they<00:00:39.270> never<00:00:39.540> break<00:00:39.870> down

00:00:39.889 --> 00:00:39.899 
but the thing is they never break down

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:41.540 
but the thing is they never break down
Kathleen<00:00:40.469> that's<00:00:40.770> always<00:00:40.980> going<00:00:41.280> to<00:00:41.309> be<00:00:41.370> that

fallen off a container ship a couple of

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:19.940 
weeks previously but you'd be wrong
because<00:01:18.960> they<00:01:19.170> actually<00:01:19.290> fell<00:01:19.710> off<00:01:19.830> the

around<00:01:36.280> here<00:01:36.640> you<00:01:37.330> labor<00:01:37.570> in<00:01:37.690> Japan<00:01:38.080> around

00:01:38.760 --> 00:01:38.770 
around here you labor in Japan around

00:01:38.770 --> 00:01:41.370 
around here you labor in Japan around
there<00:01:39.119> and<00:01:40.119> some<00:01:40.420> that<00:01:40.600> actually<00:01:40.930> got<00:01:41.080> stuck

00:01:41.370 --> 00:01:41.380 
there and some that actually got stuck

00:01:41.380 --> 00:01:44.250 
there and some that actually got stuck
in<00:01:41.950> the<00:01:42.250> Arctic<00:01:42.610> ice<00:01:42.760> they<00:01:43.119> were<00:01:43.180> carried<00:01:43.659> all

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:44.260 
in the Arctic ice they were carried all

00:01:44.260 --> 00:01:46.740 
in the Arctic ice they were carried all
around<00:01:44.710> the<00:01:45.040> Arctic<00:01:45.310> in<00:01:45.490> the<00:01:45.520> ice<00:01:45.700> and<00:01:46.600> then

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:46.750 
around the Arctic in the ice and then

00:01:46.750 --> 00:01:48.060 
around the Arctic in the ice and then
gradually<00:01:47.229> made<00:01:47.440> their<00:01:47.619> way<00:01:47.740> down<00:01:47.950> to<00:01:47.979> the

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:48.070 
gradually made their way down to the

00:01:48.070 --> 00:01:50.969 
gradually made their way down to the
Caribbean<00:01:48.700> and<00:01:49.450> then<00:01:49.600> caught<00:01:49.869> a<00:01:49.900> lift<00:01:50.200> on<00:01:50.530> the

00:01:50.969 --> 00:01:50.979 
Caribbean and then caught a lift on the

00:01:50.979 --> 00:01:53.510 
Caribbean and then caught a lift on the
North<00:01:51.190> Atlantic<00:01:51.310> drift<00:01:51.790> and<00:01:52.750> ended<00:01:53.020> up<00:01:53.110> in

00:01:53.510 --> 00:01:53.520 
North Atlantic drift and ended up in

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:57.870 
North Atlantic drift and ended up in
Cornwall<00:01:55.890> soundies<00:01:56.890> can<00:01:57.070> only<00:01:57.159> survive<00:01:57.580> for

00:01:57.870 --> 00:01:57.880 
Cornwall soundies can only survive for

00:01:57.880 --> 00:02:00.120 
Cornwall soundies can only survive for
so<00:01:58.090> long<00:01:58.330> was<00:01:58.990> because<00:01:59.020> plastic<00:01:59.500> is<00:01:59.800> made<00:01:59.979> up

00:02:00.120 --> 00:02:00.130 
so long was because plastic is made up

00:02:00.130 --> 00:02:02.310 
so long was because plastic is made up
of<00:02:00.220> these<00:02:00.310> chain<00:02:00.940> like<00:02:01.210> very<00:02:01.720> very<00:02:02.020> long

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:02.320 
of these chain like very very long

00:02:02.320 --> 00:02:03.990 
of these chain like very very long
molecules<00:02:02.920> which<00:02:03.070> all<00:02:03.220> kind<00:02:03.490> of<00:02:03.520> intermingle

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:04.000

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:06.690 
molecules which all kind of intermingle
you<00:02:04.990> mentioned<00:02:05.289> something<00:02:05.440> like<00:02:05.680> really<00:02:06.399> long

00:02:06.690 --> 00:02:06.700 
you mentioned something like really long

00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:08.490 
you mentioned something like really long
hair<00:02:06.729> that<00:02:07.000> gets<00:02:07.330> a<00:02:07.390> bit<00:02:07.420> too<00:02:07.690> massive<00:02:08.320> and

00:02:08.490 --> 00:02:08.500 
hair that gets a bit too massive and

00:02:08.500 --> 00:02:09.990 
hair that gets a bit too massive and
tangled<00:02:09.009> it's<00:02:09.160> very<00:02:09.310> very<00:02:09.519> difficult<00:02:09.729> to

00:02:09.990 --> 00:02:10.000 
tangled it's very very difficult to

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:11.580 
tangled it's very very difficult to
separate<00:02:10.450> and<00:02:11.080> that's<00:02:11.200> a<00:02:11.260> bit<00:02:11.380> like<00:02:11.470> the

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:11.590 
separate and that's a bit like the

00:02:11.590 --> 00:02:12.810 
separate and that's a bit like the
plastic<00:02:11.769> but<00:02:12.100> the<00:02:12.160> problem<00:02:12.489> is<00:02:12.610> there's

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:12.820 
plastic but the problem is there's

00:02:12.820 --> 00:02:14.759 
plastic but the problem is there's
nothing<00:02:13.000> has<00:02:13.690> actually<00:02:14.050> evolved<00:02:14.560> that<00:02:14.680> can

00:02:14.759 --> 00:02:14.769 
nothing has actually evolved that can

00:02:14.769 --> 00:02:17.100 
nothing has actually evolved that can
break<00:02:15.040> these<00:02:15.370> molecules<00:02:15.910> down<00:02:16.180> so<00:02:16.900> it<00:02:17.019> all

00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:17.110 
break these molecules down so it all

00:02:17.110 --> 00:02:19.680 
break these molecules down so it all
just<00:02:17.140> accumulates<00:02:18.130> much<00:02:18.790> of<00:02:18.970> it<00:02:19.090> ending<00:02:19.480> up<00:02:19.600> in

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:19.690 
just accumulates much of it ending up in

00:02:19.690 --> 00:02:22.410 
just accumulates much of it ending up in
our<00:02:19.810> oceans<00:02:20.260> in<00:02:21.040> fact<00:02:21.310> there<00:02:21.640> are<00:02:21.730> over<00:02:21.880> funky

00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:22.420 
our oceans in fact there are over funky

00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:24.900 
our oceans in fact there are over funky
bands<00:02:22.720> in<00:02:22.959> bits<00:02:23.170> of<00:02:23.290> plastic<00:02:23.709> per<00:02:24.040> square<00:02:24.430> mile

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:24.910 
bands in bits of plastic per square mile

00:02:24.910 --> 00:02:27.210 
bands in bits of plastic per square mile
this<00:02:25.660> holds<00:02:26.019> water<00:02:26.170> the<00:02:26.440> Pacific<00:02:26.920> you<00:02:27.040> look

00:02:27.210 --> 00:02:27.220 
this holds water the Pacific you look

00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:29.250 
this holds water the Pacific you look
like<00:02:27.400> a<00:02:27.430> sort<00:02:27.640> of<00:02:27.670> plastic<00:02:27.940> seat<00:02:28.450> because<00:02:29.110> it

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:29.260 
like a sort of plastic seat because it

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:31.070 
like a sort of plastic seat because it
is<00:02:29.380> big<00:02:29.650> bits<00:02:29.890> obviously<00:02:30.310> but<00:02:30.459> most<00:02:30.700> of<00:02:30.790> its

00:02:31.070 --> 00:02:31.080 
is big bits obviously but most of its

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:33.330

breakdown<00:02:33.790> smaller<00:02:34.239> and<00:02:34.420> smaller<00:02:34.720> but<00:02:35.140> the

00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:35.260 
breakdown smaller and smaller but the

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:37.080
