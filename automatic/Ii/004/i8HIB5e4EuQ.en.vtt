00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:06.589
 so first of all have to find a blade 

00:00:02.490 --> 00:00:09.179
 I recovered an old flat keys 

00:00:06.589 --> 00:00:10.710
 I cut off both ends of a 

00:00:09.179 --> 00:00:12.389
 hacksaw to have a man 

00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:14.400
 then you have to take a piece of wood 

00:00:12.389 --> 00:00:17.220
 for what will be the market here I think 

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:19.380
 that it must have been a wood chisel 

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:22.619
 we will create the space where we will receive the 

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:25.439
 blade and then we will work the 

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:28.170
 famous ilham on a grindstone to give a 

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:29.189
 minimum cutting edge so here a little 

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:31.590
 assembly test 

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:32.880
 it seems to work then we have 

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:33.239
 the part long enough but very 

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:35.399
 pleasant 

00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:37.200
 so we heat up the blade at 

00:00:35.399 --> 00:00:41.370
 torch to come and then twist it to 

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:42.870
 using netto and a hammer this is what 

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:44.489
 that it gives the two parts so there we 

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:45.800
 just make two small holes to see 

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:47.969
 two small screws to hold it 

00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:50.329
 that's what it looks like after game 

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:52.590
 for the story little head for the hand 

00:00:50.329 --> 00:00:54.690
 so traditionally enough of a 

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:57.329
 knife a young american normally the 

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:58.620
 market long enough so here I tested 

00:00:57.329 --> 00:01:01.649
 but I preferred more brave the 

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:03.960
 shorten then here is the blade without 

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:06.450
 polishing nor anything of a small job 

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:08.220
 still to do so here I shortened the 

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:11.070
 match it's a lot more convenient for 

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:12.869
 use it then big work of 

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:16.070
 sanding which I start at 50 for 

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:19.680
 roughing and increasingly small and 

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:21.689
 more and more done to finish on the 

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:24.390
 320 we presume not surprising enough we 

00:01:21.689 --> 00:01:24.900
 look like in plastic where a horn that 

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:26.490
 it's nice 

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:29.640
 then it remains more than sticking a 

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:30.150
 little piece of leather to finish a little 

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:32.159
 all 

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:35.100
 lalande its context a little to link done 

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:37.710
 nice I take good work on the 

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:39.979
 blade a little ghz and a little polish 

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:44.340
 to make it finished 

00:01:39.979 --> 00:01:46.500
 so here is the expensive ended so the 

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:48.380
 grinds is inside has like 

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:51.240
 traditionally on motorcycles win 

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:53.880
 so it's a bit boring to achieve 

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:55.290
 actually on the word at 164 that's at 

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:58.110
 the outside is a lot more 

00:01:55.290 --> 00:02:01.049
 practice so there must be sharpened with 

00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:02.640
 sandpaper rotate around them 

00:02:01.049 --> 00:02:03.290
 a little stick you that's more 

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:05.280
 effective 

00:02:03.290 --> 00:02:08.789
 so I'm biting it to myself 

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:10.409
 especially for decorating and more 

00:02:08.789 --> 00:02:13.109
 starting from a flat key it's not 

00:02:10.409 --> 00:02:15.319
 superb steel but it could 

00:02:13.109 --> 00:02:15.319
 walk
