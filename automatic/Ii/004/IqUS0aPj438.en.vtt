00:00:24.620 --> 00:00:24.630 
people out they would have actually

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:27.589 
people out they would have actually
heard<00:00:24.930> of<00:00:25.140> this<00:00:25.230> show<00:00:25.439> um<00:00:26.269> when<00:00:27.269> they<00:00:27.390> should

00:02:11.210 --> 00:02:11.220 
you have to basically do a technical

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:13.460 
you have to basically do a technical
challenge<00:02:11.250> where<00:02:11.790> you<00:02:11.910> basically<00:02:12.120> follow

00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:13.470 
challenge where you basically follow

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:17.210 
challenge where you basically follow
recipe<00:02:14.010> a<00:02:14.250> very<00:02:15.410> strict<00:02:16.410> recipe<00:02:16.890> that's<00:02:16.980> very

00:02:17.210 --> 00:02:17.220 
recipe a very strict recipe that's very

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:19.010 
recipe a very strict recipe that's very
very<00:02:17.310> limited<00:02:17.550> and<00:02:17.910> basically<00:02:18.630> you've<00:02:18.810> got<00:02:18.930> to

00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:19.020 
very limited and basically you've got to

00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:20.660 
very limited and basically you've got to
try<00:02:19.170> and<00:02:19.320> make<00:02:19.500> something<00:02:20.250> that's<00:02:20.490> quite

00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:20.670 
try and make something that's quite

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:23.330 
try and make something that's quite
common<00:02:20.910> in<00:02:21.270> that<00:02:21.750> sense<00:02:21.990> so<00:02:22.140> like<00:02:22.320> in<00:02:23.220> the

00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:23.340 
common in that sense so like in the

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:27.440 
common in that sense so like in the
biscuits<00:02:23.790> they<00:02:24.210> had<00:02:24.420> to<00:02:24.570> make<00:02:24.780> a<00:02:26.180> brandy<00:02:27.180> snap

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:27.450 
biscuits they had to make a brandy snap

00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:29.780 
biscuits they had to make a brandy snap
which<00:02:27.720> is<00:02:27.870> probably<00:02:28.080> it's<00:02:28.380> very<00:02:28.560> very<00:02:28.890> hard<00:02:29.550> to

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:29.790 
which is probably it's very very hard to

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:32.270 
which is probably it's very very hard to
make<00:02:29.820> a<00:02:30.180> very<00:02:30.390> very<00:02:30.660> common<00:02:31.130> biscuit<00:02:32.130> and<00:02:32.220> so

00:02:32.270 --> 00:02:32.280 
make a very very common biscuit and so

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:33.710 
make a very very common biscuit and so
it's<00:02:32.430> quite<00:02:32.700> things<00:02:33.090> that<00:02:33.300> basically<00:02:33.540> people

00:02:33.710 --> 00:02:33.720 
it's quite things that basically people

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:35.690 
it's quite things that basically people
should<00:02:34.110> be<00:02:34.140> able<00:02:34.290> to<00:02:34.590> make<00:02:34.710> but<00:02:34.920> very<00:02:35.220> hard<00:02:35.490> to

00:02:35.690 --> 00:02:35.700 
should be able to make but very hard to

00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:37.640 
should be able to make but very hard to
do<00:02:35.820> correctly<00:02:36.360> and<00:02:36.690> then<00:02:37.290> in<00:02:37.440> the<00:02:37.500> final

00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:37.650 
do correctly and then in the final

00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:40.040 
do correctly and then in the final
stages<00:02:38.070> of<00:02:38.220> the<00:02:38.400> program<00:02:38.820> you<00:02:39.660> then<00:02:39.840> have<00:02:40.020> to

00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:40.050 
stages of the program you then have to

00:02:40.050 --> 00:02:41.510 
stages of the program you then have to
basically<00:02:40.260> make<00:02:40.560> your<00:02:40.770> masterpiece<00:02:41.340> where

00:02:41.510 --> 00:02:41.520 
basically make your masterpiece where

00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:43.040 
basically make your masterpiece where

00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:43.050 
you get five hours to basically make

00:02:43.050 --> 00:02:44.600 
you get five hours to basically make
something<00:02:43.320> completely<00:02:43.860> new<00:02:43.890> and<00:02:44.010> better<00:02:44.310> show
