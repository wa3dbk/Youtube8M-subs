00:00:16.620 --> 00:00:20.920
Hello and welcome! It's special episode of 'Pojechani'. We are

00:00:20.920 --> 00:00:22.320
Sebastian Piekarz aaaand

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:23.040
Pawel Olszowik

00:00:23.520 --> 00:00:27.260
Today we are at gokart track Elikart M!

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:32.320
We are wearing special sporty colors, but we will explain that later.

00:00:32.320 --> 00:00:37.980
Gokart track is the place where most of professional drivers began their adventure with motosport.

00:00:38.220 --> 00:00:40.600
Karting is a sport for everyone.

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:45.760
It is simple. If you want to race, leave the streets, come here and do it safe.

00:00:45.760 --> 00:00:50.740
But this episode is special because we've invited someone who knows his job.

00:00:51.220 --> 00:00:55.120
Our todays guest is karting expert, Marcin...

00:00:55.580 --> 00:00:59.280
Back to the studio. Halo halo Marcin can you hear us?

00:01:00.140 --> 00:01:04.920
Hi! I'm  Marcin Mysliwiec. I'm karting coach on Eikart M track.

00:01:05.380 --> 00:01:08.080
I run karting school and private lessons.

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:15.040
Karting is a sport for evrybody, no matter what age.

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:24.700
Hall karting is not expesive. You can feel the adrenaline for the cinema tickets price!

00:01:25.440 --> 00:01:31.420
Believe me, it is way better than any movie and gives you more fun!

00:01:32.140 --> 00:01:42.700
It is safe. Every driver wears a racing helmet so it is almost impossible to get hurt.

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:50.660
Before the race, everybody is instructed. We are explaining the rules and the meaning of the flags.

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:56.920
If you follow those rules the risk of dangerous accident is close to zero!

00:01:57.120 --> 00:02:02.120
What about the power? Engine has 9 bhp. Top speed around 60 km/h.

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:07.100
We have those 9 bhp go-carts and they are the fastest in Cracow and Poland!

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:12.040
Lap time is measured with a digital precision to 0,001 of a second.

00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:19.760
Thanks to a chip, that is mounted to every go-cart, we are able to check our laps time.

00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:26.080
Skills? You can improve them with ease by taking individual lessons. Those are for young and adult as well.

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:37.040
You can learn how to perfect every corner, how to work with acceleration and how to time breaking.

00:02:37.460 --> 00:02:40.420
There are also tournaments that you can participate.

00:02:40.580 --> 00:02:51.120
To be a professional go-cart driver you need to have  an imagination, petrol in your veins and practice, practice and practice!

00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:55.460
Halo halo Marcin... Thank you very much for your precious advices.

00:02:56.220 --> 00:03:01.240
We had a theoretical lecture, so now it's for practical part!

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:03.280
And that's a good idea!

00:03:03.580 --> 00:03:04.220
Let's go!

00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:25.860
While they are trying to do best laps, I will show you how to master the corners!

00:03:26.460 --> 00:03:30.240
When there is a straight bit we should drive with maximum speed.

00:03:30.240 --> 00:03:32.208
Enter the corner widely.

00:03:35.300 --> 00:03:37.300
Break before the corner.

00:03:37.666 --> 00:03:39.666
Take it slowly.

00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:44.240
Then turn the steering wheel and go as close as possible to the bounds.

00:03:45.600 --> 00:03:49.100
If there will be a little bit of understeer, it's ok.

00:03:49.100 --> 00:03:51.026
The most important thing is to leave the corner quickly.

00:03:55.460 --> 00:03:57.780
At this point, reduce some speed.

00:03:58.140 --> 00:04:00.140
And at the top of the corner - full power!

00:04:00.920 --> 00:04:02.766
For quicker leaving it.

00:04:14.280 --> 00:04:18.820
Well... As I see guys even don't know flags... I will show you.

00:04:19.500 --> 00:04:24.040
Blue flag. It means someone behind you is quicker so you have to  let him overtake you.

00:04:24.400 --> 00:04:30.420
Yellow flag is a warning flag. Someone has drove into the tires, so you need to slow down and be cautious.

00:04:30.760 --> 00:04:36.060
Red flag means end of the race. We need to stop there where the crew tells us.

00:04:36.320 --> 00:04:39.160
And the checker, black and white, means that we have one last lap.

00:04:39.180 --> 00:04:41.380
And then stop at the red flag.

00:05:09.220 --> 00:05:13.560
In the end we have a very special contest for you. You can win this t-shirt...

00:05:13.560 --> 00:05:15.120
... or this t-shirt!

00:05:15.420 --> 00:05:19.940
