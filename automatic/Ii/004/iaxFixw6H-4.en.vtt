so<00:01:53.490> you<00:01:53.549> can<00:01:53.729> actually<00:01:53.880> fix<00:01:54.329> so<00:01:54.869> you<00:01:54.930> can

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:55.110 
so you can actually fix so you can

00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:56.630 
so you can actually fix so you can
actually<00:01:55.170> have<00:01:55.439> a<00:01:55.500> direct<00:01:55.799> paint<00:01:56.009> blowing

00:02:03.719 --> 00:02:05.959 
running out of the systems of course you
actually<00:02:04.110> have<00:02:04.229> I<00:02:04.259> oshio<00:02:04.770> with<00:02:05.250> host<00:02:05.610> so<00:02:05.909> you

00:02:05.959 --> 00:02:05.969 
actually have I oshio with host so you

00:02:05.969 --> 00:02:08.240 
actually have I oshio with host so you
can<00:02:06.210> actually<00:02:06.360> run<00:02:06.630> the<00:02:06.659> arrows<00:02:07.020> out<00:02:07.200> yeah<00:02:07.710> so

00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:08.250 
can actually run the arrows out yeah so

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:11.130 
can actually run the arrows out yeah so
Jack<00:02:08.550> obviously<00:02:09.060> callings<00:02:09.539> a<00:02:09.750> big<00:02:09.989> big

00:02:11.130 --> 00:02:11.140 
Jack obviously callings a big big

00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:13.860 
Jack obviously callings a big big
the<00:02:11.319> necessary<00:02:12.100> to<00:02:12.340> next<00:02:13.030> generation<00:02:13.480> but

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:13.870 
the necessary to next generation but

00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:15.570 
the necessary to next generation but
what<00:02:14.290> are<00:02:14.440> some<00:02:14.650> other<00:02:14.770> features<00:02:15.010> of<00:02:15.280> this

00:02:15.570 --> 00:02:15.580 
what are some other features of this

00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:17.250 
what are some other features of this
motherboard<00:02:15.940> ok<00:02:16.660> this<00:02:16.780> might<00:02:16.959> be<00:02:17.050> but<00:02:17.170> also

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:17.260 
motherboard ok this might be but also

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:20.370 
motherboard ok this might be but also
also<00:02:17.920> pinches<00:02:18.459> the<00:02:18.490> generic<00:02:19.150> peaches<00:02:19.630> Oh<00:02:19.810> what

00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:20.380 
also pinches the generic peaches Oh what

00:02:20.380 --> 00:02:23.070 
also pinches the generic peaches Oh what
we<00:02:20.500> actually<00:02:20.680> have<00:02:21.550> down<00:02:21.760> our<00:02:21.910> our<00:02:22.540> new<00:02:22.810> pad

a cpu vico plus VCC sa basically is the

00:03:00.509 --> 00:03:00.519 
to be able to deliver a much more

00:03:00.519 --> 00:03:02.520 
to be able to deliver a much more
precise<00:03:00.820> control<00:03:01.239> and<00:03:01.420> also<00:03:01.780> of<00:03:01.989> course

00:03:02.520 --> 00:03:02.530 
precise control and also of course

00:03:02.530 --> 00:03:06.600 
precise control and also of course
mostly<00:03:03.070> ability<00:03:03.580> and<00:03:04.530> then<00:03:05.530> I<00:03:05.739> come<00:03:06.250> till<00:03:06.459> it

00:03:06.600 --> 00:03:06.610 
mostly ability and then I come till it

00:03:06.610 --> 00:03:08.880 
mostly ability and then I come till it
to<00:03:07.540> the<00:03:07.630> south<00:03:07.810> side<00:03:08.019> of<00:03:08.080> the<00:03:08.260> system<00:03:08.440> we<00:03:08.769> can

00:03:08.880 --> 00:03:08.890 
to the south side of the system we can

00:03:08.890 --> 00:03:10.949 
to the south side of the system we can
actually<00:03:09.220> find<00:03:09.430> our<00:03:09.730> SSD<00:03:10.090> caching<00:03:10.420> ok

00:03:10.949 --> 00:03:10.959 
actually find our SSD caching ok

00:03:10.959 --> 00:03:14.070 
actually find our SSD caching ok
basically<00:03:11.190> SSD<00:03:12.190> caching<00:03:12.400> is<00:03:12.670> faced<00:03:13.000> ok<00:03:13.840> it's

00:03:14.070 --> 00:03:14.080 
basically SSD caching is faced ok it's

00:03:14.080 --> 00:03:17.160 
basically SSD caching is faced ok it's
based<00:03:14.320> on<00:03:14.500> the<00:03:14.680> mobile<00:03:14.860> solution<00:03:15.370> ok<00:03:16.030> as<00:03:16.239> we

00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:17.170 
based on the mobile solution ok as we

00:03:17.170 --> 00:03:19.650 
based on the mobile solution ok as we
all<00:03:17.290> know<00:03:17.320> mafia<00:03:17.650> solution<00:03:18.280> has<00:03:18.579> pesca<00:03:19.510> with

00:03:19.650 --> 00:03:19.660 
all know mafia solution has pesca with

00:03:19.660 --> 00:03:22.410 
all know mafia solution has pesca with
Holly<00:03:19.959> so<00:03:20.170> called<00:03:20.470> hyper<00:03:20.739> deal<00:03:21.070> ok<00:03:21.910> where<00:03:22.150> you

00:03:22.410 --> 00:03:22.420 
Holly so called hyper deal ok where you

00:03:22.420 --> 00:03:24.900 
Holly so called hyper deal ok where you
will<00:03:22.630> be<00:03:22.780> able<00:03:22.900> to<00:03:23.079> use<00:03:23.829> when<00:03:24.100> SSD<00:03:24.549> and<00:03:24.579> one

00:03:24.900 --> 00:03:24.910 
will be able to use when SSD and one

00:03:24.910 --> 00:03:27.030 
will be able to use when SSD and one
hard<00:03:25.150> drive<00:03:25.239> and<00:03:25.570> actually<00:03:26.470> incorporate<00:03:26.920> this

00:03:27.030 --> 00:03:27.040 
hard drive and actually incorporate this

00:03:27.040 --> 00:03:30.960 
hard drive and actually incorporate this
to<00:03:27.310> perform<00:03:28.060> either<00:03:28.299> secure<00:03:28.900> oh<00:03:29.140> the<00:03:29.470> boost<00:03:29.970> ok

00:03:30.960 --> 00:03:30.970 
to perform either secure oh the boost ok

00:03:30.970 --> 00:03:33.180 
to perform either secure oh the boost ok
so<00:03:31.030> Jack<00:03:31.900> this<00:03:32.049> is<00:03:32.230> pretty<00:03:32.440> similar<00:03:32.680> to<00:03:32.860> the

00:03:33.180 --> 00:03:33.190 
so Jack this is pretty similar to the

00:03:33.190 --> 00:03:39.479 
so Jack this is pretty similar to the
intel<00:03:34.860> SSD<00:03:35.860> caching<00:03:36.489> solution<00:03:38.010> but<00:03:39.010> we<00:03:39.220> saw<00:03:39.400> in

00:03:39.479 --> 00:03:39.489 
intel SSD caching solution but we saw in

00:03:39.489 --> 00:03:42.330 
intel SSD caching solution but we saw in
the<00:03:39.519> presentation<00:03:40.150> that<00:03:40.709> this<00:03:41.709> this<00:03:42.040> solution

00:03:42.330 --> 00:03:42.340 
the presentation that this this solution

00:03:42.340 --> 00:03:45.509 
the presentation that this this solution
is<00:03:42.549> actually<00:03:43.420> much<00:03:43.540> easier<00:03:43.600> and<00:03:44.130> simpler<00:03:45.130> to

00:03:45.509 --> 00:03:45.519 
is actually much easier and simpler to

00:03:45.519 --> 00:03:48.330 
is actually much easier and simpler to
set<00:03:45.790> up<00:03:45.940> yes<00:03:46.329> correct<00:03:46.930> ok<00:03:47.560> the<00:03:48.010> people's

00:03:48.330 --> 00:03:48.340 
set up yes correct ok the people's

00:03:48.340 --> 00:03:51.030 
set up yes correct ok the people's
between<00:03:48.700> our<00:03:49.079> between<00:03:50.079> the<00:03:50.320> peoples<00:03:50.829> we<00:03:50.920> know

00:03:51.030 --> 00:03:51.040 
between our between the peoples we know

00:03:51.040 --> 00:03:53.250 
between our between the peoples we know
it<00:03:51.190> is<00:03:51.280> education<00:03:51.820> and<00:03:52.030> also<00:03:52.329> the<00:03:52.540> SR<00:03:52.900> he<00:03:53.079> is

00:03:53.250 --> 00:03:53.260 
it is education and also the SR he is

00:03:53.260 --> 00:03:55.470 
it is education and also the SR he is
the<00:03:53.470> fact<00:03:53.680> that<00:03:53.769> you<00:03:54.220> can<00:03:54.459> only<00:03:54.610> you<00:03:55.000> can<00:03:55.150> just

00:03:55.470 --> 00:03:55.480 
the fact that you can only you can just

00:03:55.480 --> 00:03:57.420 
the fact that you can only you can just
connect<00:03:55.989> your<00:03:56.140> SSD<00:03:56.590> after<00:03:57.280> the<00:03:57.400> installation

00:03:57.420 --> 00:03:57.430 
connect your SSD after the installation

00:03:57.430 --> 00:03:59.819 
connect your SSD after the installation
of<00:03:57.910> OS<00:03:58.180> onto<00:03:58.540> the<00:03:58.660> harddrive<00:03:58.900> you<00:03:59.380> can<00:03:59.500> just<00:03:59.709> in

00:03:59.819 --> 00:03:59.829 
of OS onto the harddrive you can just in

00:03:59.829 --> 00:04:01.740 
of OS onto the harddrive you can just in
