00:04:46.250 --> 00:04:47.920 
bit more normal cadence i don't think i
would<00:04:46.310> have<00:04:46.460> minded<00:04:46.699> him<00:04:47.090> as<00:04:47.240> much<00:04:47.479> but

00:04:47.920 --> 00:04:47.930 
would have minded him as much but

00:04:47.930 --> 00:04:50.080 
would have minded him as much but
anytime<00:04:48.139> you<00:04:48.289> get<00:04:48.469> all<00:04:48.650> like<00:04:48.919> I<00:04:49.159> am<00:04:49.340> I<00:04:49.520> thien<00:04:49.789> or

00:04:50.080 --> 00:04:50.090 
anytime you get all like I am I thien or

00:04:50.090 --> 00:04:51.459 
anytime you get all like I am I thien or
not<00:04:50.300> why<00:04:50.419> any<00:04:50.539> high<00:04:50.689> invest<00:04:51.050> and<00:04:51.289> super

00:04:51.459 --> 00:04:51.469 
not why any high invest and super

00:04:51.469 --> 00:04:52.450 
not why any high invest and super
jittery<00:04:51.650> and<00:04:51.860> something<00:04:52.069> like<00:04:52.159> that<00:04:52.310> he<00:04:52.430> just

00:04:52.450 --> 00:04:52.460 
jittery and something like that he just

00:04:52.460 --> 00:04:55.089 
jittery and something like that he just
sounded<00:04:52.849> so<00:04:52.939> freaking<00:04:53.659> annoying<00:04:53.780> so<00:04:54.590> uh<00:04:54.620> yeah

00:04:55.089 --> 00:04:55.099 
sounded so freaking annoying so uh yeah

00:04:55.099 --> 00:04:57.219 
sounded so freaking annoying so uh yeah
the<00:04:55.280> voice<00:04:55.520> acting<00:04:56.060> really<00:04:56.210> bothered<00:04:57.110> me<00:04:57.139> I

00:04:57.219 --> 00:04:57.229 
the voice acting really bothered me I

00:04:57.229 --> 00:04:58.600 
the voice acting really bothered me I
think<00:04:57.349> if<00:04:57.560> they<00:04:57.650> got<00:04:57.949> with<00:04:58.099> nolan<00:04:58.430> north

00:04:58.600 --> 00:04:58.610 
think if they got with nolan north

00:04:58.610 --> 00:05:00.820 
think if they got with nolan north
obviously<00:04:59.180> it<00:04:59.300> would<00:04:59.419> have<00:04:59.449> sounded<00:05:00.199> better

00:05:00.820 --> 00:05:00.830 
obviously it would have sounded better

00:05:00.830 --> 00:05:04.269 
obviously it would have sounded better
but<00:05:01.370> i<00:05:01.699> don't<00:05:02.240> found<00:05:03.020> no<00:05:03.169> no<00:05:03.349> nolan<00:05:04.069> north

00:05:04.269 --> 00:05:04.279 
but i don't found no no nolan north

00:05:04.279 --> 00:05:06.850 
but i don't found no no nolan north
better<00:05:04.849> it<00:05:05.060> kind<00:05:05.330> of<00:05:05.560> slowing<00:05:06.560> down<00:05:06.680> and

00:05:06.850 --> 00:05:06.860 
better it kind of slowing down and

00:05:06.860 --> 00:05:08.170 
better it kind of slowing down and
making<00:05:07.009> this<00:05:07.189> conversation<00:05:07.819> see<00:05:07.969> more

00:05:08.170 --> 00:05:08.180 
making this conversation see more

00:05:08.180 --> 00:05:10.360 
making this conversation see more
natural<00:05:08.860> so<00:05:09.860> I<00:05:09.889> don't<00:05:10.009> know<00:05:10.069> they<00:05:10.189> couldn't

00:05:10.360 --> 00:05:10.370 
natural so I don't know they couldn't

00:05:10.370 --> 00:05:11.559 
natural so I don't know they couldn't
pull<00:05:10.520> it<00:05:10.550> off<00:05:10.699> hell<00:05:10.909> they<00:05:11.060> could<00:05:11.210> have<00:05:11.300> always

00:05:11.559 --> 00:05:11.569 
pull it off hell they could have always

00:05:11.569 --> 00:05:13.300 
pull it off hell they could have always
called<00:05:11.779> me<00:05:12.050> though<00:05:12.259> I<00:05:12.500> would<00:05:12.889> have<00:05:13.009> done<00:05:13.129> it
