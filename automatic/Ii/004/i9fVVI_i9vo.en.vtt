hi<00:00:06.390> in<00:00:06.540> this<00:00:06.569> video<00:00:06.839> let<00:00:07.140> me<00:00:07.200> introduce<00:00:07.350> how<00:00:07.710> to

00:00:07.760 --> 00:00:07.770 
hi in this video let me introduce how to

00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:09.799 
hi in this video let me introduce how to
explore<00:00:08.370> the<00:00:08.429> limit<00:00:08.790> cache<00:00:09.000> throws<00:00:09.599> the

00:00:09.799 --> 00:00:09.809 
explore the limit cache throws the

00:00:09.809 --> 00:00:14.030 
explore the limit cache throws the
midwifery<00:00:10.380> point<00:00:10.650> O<00:00:10.800> and<00:00:11.660> the<00:00:12.660> firstly<00:00:13.110> we

00:00:14.030 --> 00:00:14.040 
midwifery point O and the firstly we

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:15.980 
midwifery point O and the firstly we
have<00:00:14.070> to<00:00:14.250> make<00:00:14.580> sure<00:00:14.790> your<00:00:15.150> my<00:00:15.330> version<00:00:15.690> is

00:00:15.980 --> 00:00:15.990 
have to make sure your my version is

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:18.320 
have to make sure your my version is
higher<00:00:16.379> than<00:00:17.090> 2012

00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:18.330 
higher than 2012

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:23.109 
higher than 2012
it<00:00:18.630> must<00:00:18.930> be<00:00:19.460> 2013<00:00:20.460> or<00:00:21.029> 2014

00:00:23.109 --> 00:00:23.119 
it must be 2013 or 2014

00:00:23.119 --> 00:00:29.210 
it must be 2013 or 2014
firstly<00:00:24.119> it's<00:00:24.570> open<00:00:25.939> sample<00:00:26.939> file<00:00:27.199> the<00:00:28.220> render

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:29.220 
firstly it's open sample file the render

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:38.510 
firstly it's open sample file the render
the<00:00:29.760> sample<00:00:30.150> 48<00:00:34.910> and<00:00:37.010> the<00:00:38.010> step<00:00:38.280> is<00:00:38.489> very

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:38.520 
the sample 48 and the step is very

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:40.760 
the sample 48 and the step is very
simple<00:00:39.120> firstly<00:00:39.570> in<00:00:39.719> the<00:00:39.840> open<00:00:40.050> the<00:00:40.140> occasion

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:40.770 
simple firstly in the open the occasion

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:50.779 
simple firstly in the open the occasion
cache<00:00:47.899> and<00:00:48.899> then<00:00:49.200> let's<00:00:49.649> create<00:00:49.860> our<00:00:50.250> mesh<00:00:50.579> by

00:00:50.779 --> 00:00:50.789 
cache and then let's create our mesh by

00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:54.500 
cache and then let's create our mesh by
frequent<00:00:51.270> no<00:00:51.360> cache<00:00:52.280> here<00:00:53.280> is<00:00:53.489> this<00:00:53.670> passed<00:00:54.090> D

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:54.510 
frequent no cache here is this passed D

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:56.990 
frequent no cache here is this passed D
Drive<00:00:54.809> ABC<00:00:55.260> and<00:00:55.500> empty<00:00:55.890> three<00:00:56.160> test<00:00:56.430> two<00:00:56.730> and

00:00:56.990 --> 00:00:57.000 
Drive ABC and empty three test two and

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:01.510 
Drive ABC and empty three test two and
at<00:00:57.960> endless<00:00:58.230> export<00:00:58.949> day

00:01:01.510 --> 00:01:01.520 

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:06.280 

the<00:01:02.360> mister<00:01:02.660> I<00:01:02.720> frequent<00:01:03.200> no<00:01:03.290> cash<00:01:03.590> in<00:01:05.290> after

00:01:06.280 --> 00:01:06.290 
the mister I frequent no cash in after

00:01:06.290 --> 00:01:08.770 
the mister I frequent no cash in after
that<00:01:06.640> D<00:01:07.640> policeman<00:01:08.090> agent<00:01:08.480> and<00:01:08.690> the

00:01:08.770 --> 00:01:08.780 
that D policeman agent and the

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:10.600 
that D policeman agent and the
duplicated<00:01:09.290> meshes<00:01:09.770> and<00:01:10.010> the<00:01:10.220> randomized

00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:10.610 
duplicated meshes and the randomized

00:01:10.610 --> 00:01:13.620 
duplicated meshes and the randomized
texture<00:01:11.110> because<00:01:12.110> we<00:01:12.290> are<00:01:12.440> going<00:01:12.650> to<00:01:12.800> expose

00:01:13.620 --> 00:01:13.630 
texture because we are going to expose

00:01:13.630 --> 00:01:16.510 
texture because we are going to expose
the<00:01:14.630> limbic<00:01:14.930> cache<00:01:15.170> you<00:01:15.470> can<00:01:15.710> just<00:01:16.370> ignore

00:01:16.510 --> 00:01:16.520 
the limbic cache you can just ignore

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:20.320 
the limbic cache you can just ignore
this<00:01:17.000> step<00:01:17.979> it's<00:01:18.979> nothing<00:01:19.370> it's<00:01:19.790> nothing<00:01:20.030> to

00:01:20.320 --> 00:01:20.330 
this step it's nothing it's nothing to

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:23.320 
this step it's nothing it's nothing to
do<00:01:20.479> with<00:01:20.810> the<00:01:21.110> texture<00:01:21.830> and<00:01:22.090> enable<00:01:23.090> image

00:01:23.320 --> 00:01:23.330 
do with the texture and enable image

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:29.950 
do with the texture and enable image
drive<00:01:26.830> in<00:01:27.830> it<00:01:27.979> then<00:01:28.180> you<00:01:29.180> can<00:01:29.360> select<00:01:29.720> all<00:01:29.930> of

00:01:29.950 --> 00:01:29.960 
drive in it then you can select all of

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:35.170 
drive in it then you can select all of
this<00:01:30.790> geometries<00:01:33.550> so<00:01:34.550> that<00:01:34.670> all<00:01:34.880> of<00:01:35.030> this

00:01:35.170 --> 00:01:35.180 
this geometries so that all of this

00:01:35.180 --> 00:01:41.650 
this geometries so that all of this
geometry<00:01:35.750> and<00:01:35.900> export<00:01:36.350> the<00:01:36.590> limbic<00:01:37.460> -<00:01:40.660> limba

will<00:01:57.950> export<00:01:58.310> one<00:01:58.550> by<00:01:58.729> one<00:01:58.910> frame<00:01:59.180> where<00:01:59.479> it's

00:01:59.560 --> 00:01:59.570 
will export one by one frame where it's

00:01:59.570 --> 00:02:06.030 
will export one by one frame where it's

00:02:06.040 --> 00:02:16.970 

the<00:02:06.760> speed<00:02:07.030> is<00:02:07.240> pretty<00:02:07.570> okay<00:02:12.090> and<00:02:13.090> after<00:02:13.270> that

00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:16.980 

00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:21.660 

it's<00:02:17.980> clear<00:02:18.340> all<00:02:18.730> of<00:02:19.000> this<00:02:19.210> contents<00:02:19.780> and<00:02:20.680> then

00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:21.670 
it's clear all of this contents and then

00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:23.880 
it's clear all of this contents and then
you<00:02:21.850> can<00:02:22.030> just<00:02:22.270> inside<00:02:23.170> of<00:02:23.200> the<00:02:23.320> totally

00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:23.890 
you can just inside of the totally

00:02:23.890 --> 00:02:27.920 
you can just inside of the totally
brand-new<00:02:24.250> file<00:02:24.730> and<00:02:26.160> the<00:02:27.160> pipeline<00:02:27.430> cache

file<00:02:31.710> and<00:02:33.510> everything<00:02:34.510> will<00:02:34.840> be<00:02:34.870> alright

00:02:41.510 --> 00:02:41.520 

00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:43.790 

at<00:02:41.580> this<00:02:42.360> time<00:02:42.630> you<00:02:42.840> can<00:02:43.020> render<00:02:43.260> your<00:02:43.500> scene

00:02:43.790 --> 00:02:43.800 
at this time you can render your scene

00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:45.650 
at this time you can render your scene
with<00:02:44.100> all<00:02:44.370> of<00:02:44.550> the<00:02:44.730> renderer<00:02:45.030> whatever<00:02:45.480> you
