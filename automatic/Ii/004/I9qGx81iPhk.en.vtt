00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:19.619
 feeder din 

00:00:15.980 --> 00:00:21.470
 go van and made up to drink for 

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:25.980
 make a loop 

00:00:21.470 --> 00:00:28.710
 one tap is made so that we 

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:31.189
 could tighten it on our main 

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:31.189
 basis 

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:39.559
 you and trim material 

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:48.199
 but when we only got it 

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:48.199
 then 

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:52.219
 put on sleep 

00:00:58.700 --> 00:01:09.170

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:56.750
 the design is securely fixed on us 

00:01:51.900 --> 00:02:02.300

00:01:56.750 --> 00:02:02.300
 ship he was below our feeder 

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:16.549
 doing a loop and works 

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:23.620
 and then so that the knot is well drawn 

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:33.750
 extra tip is required 

00:02:38.650 --> 00:02:44.530
 and now we have found there 

00:02:42.129 --> 00:02:47.920
 we add cadmus because we will 

00:02:44.530 --> 00:02:50.500
 tie through the clasp this for 

00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:55.319
 so that in time you can change the stick 

00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:55.319
 feeders for again weights old
