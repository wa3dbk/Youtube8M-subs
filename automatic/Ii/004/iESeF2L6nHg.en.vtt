00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:54.120 
nice pass from Chris mom to like I said

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:56.420 
nice pass from Chris mom to like I said
he<00:00:54.780> just<00:00:55.050> runs<00:00:55.350> past<00:00:55.590> my<00:00:55.800> goalkeeper<00:00:56.399> and

00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:56.430 
he just runs past my goalkeeper and

00:00:56.430 --> 00:00:58.220 
he just runs past my goalkeeper and
those<00:00:56.670> kind<00:00:56.940> of<00:00:57.000> girls<00:00:57.180> are<00:00:57.420> so<00:00:57.780> annoying<00:00:58.079> to

00:00:58.220 --> 00:00:58.230 
those kind of girls are so annoying to

00:00:58.230 --> 00:00:59.599 
those kind of girls are so annoying to
concede<00:00:58.680> because<00:00:58.980> you<00:00:59.100> can't<00:00:59.280> really<00:00:59.430> do

00:00:59.599 --> 00:00:59.609 
concede because you can't really do

00:00:59.609 --> 00:01:01.580 
concede because you can't really do
anything<00:00:59.850> apart<00:01:00.449> from<00:01:00.750> maybe<00:01:01.020> not<00:01:01.320> letting

00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:01.590 
anything apart from maybe not letting

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:03.799 
anything apart from maybe not letting
your<00:01:01.710> goalkeeper<00:01:01.949> come<00:01:02.430> out<00:01:02.579> but<00:01:02.879> I<00:01:02.940> think<00:01:03.570> how

00:01:03.799 --> 00:01:03.809 
your goalkeeper come out but I think how

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:05.899 
your goalkeeper come out but I think how
at<00:01:04.140> that<00:01:04.290> point<00:01:04.589> actually<00:01:04.830> did<00:01:05.159> it<00:01:05.189> himself<00:01:05.400> so

00:01:05.899 --> 00:01:05.909 
at that point actually did it himself so

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:07.730 
at that point actually did it himself so
it<00:01:05.970> was<00:01:06.090> pretty<00:01:06.270> annoying<00:01:06.600> but<00:01:06.840> still<00:01:07.080> it<00:01:07.530> was

00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:07.740 
it was pretty annoying but still it was

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:10.039 
it was pretty annoying but still it was
only<00:01:07.979> 11<00:01:08.189> so<00:01:08.580> it<00:01:08.729> was<00:01:08.880> a<00:01:08.909> really<00:01:09.119> dead<00:01:09.420> bet<00:01:09.720> but

00:01:10.039 --> 00:01:10.049 
only 11 so it was a really dead bet but

00:01:10.049 --> 00:01:11.690 
only 11 so it was a really dead bet but
surprisingly<00:01:10.770> that<00:01:11.010> is<00:01:11.100> how<00:01:11.189> the<00:01:11.250> whole<00:01:11.460> game

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:11.700 
surprisingly that is how the whole game

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:13.520 
surprisingly that is how the whole game
ended<00:01:12.060> at<00:01:12.360> least<00:01:12.570> for<00:01:12.810> the<00:01:12.869> 90<00:01:13.200> minutes

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:13.530 
ended at least for the 90 minutes

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:15.679 
ended at least for the 90 minutes
because<00:01:13.650> we<00:01:13.950> had<00:01:14.070> to<00:01:14.189> go<00:01:14.340> into<00:01:14.580> extra<00:01:15.150> time<00:01:15.450> and

00:01:15.679 --> 00:01:15.689 
because we had to go into extra time and

00:01:15.689 --> 00:01:17.420 
because we had to go into extra time and
overall<00:01:16.500> it<00:01:16.619> was<00:01:16.740> not<00:01:16.920> really<00:01:17.130> the<00:01:17.250> most

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:17.430 
overall it was not really the most

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:18.920 
overall it was not really the most
exciting<00:01:17.970> game<00:01:18.000> we<00:01:18.270> both<00:01:18.509> didn't<00:01:18.810> already

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:18.930 
exciting game we both didn't already

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:20.929 
exciting game we both didn't already
create<00:01:19.290> that<00:01:19.409> many<00:01:19.650> chances<00:01:19.950> you<00:01:20.729> got<00:01:20.850> his

00:01:20.929 --> 00:01:20.939 
create that many chances you got his

00:01:20.939 --> 00:01:22.640 
create that many chances you got his
first<00:01:21.090> gen<00:01:21.299> so<00:01:21.450> in<00:01:21.570> the<00:01:21.659> first<00:01:21.869> off<00:01:22.110> XO<00:01:22.500> time

is how the game ended towards the end of

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:54.950 
is how the game ended towards the end of
the<00:01:53.970> game<00:01:54.030> he<00:01:54.299> probably<00:01:54.479> could<00:01:54.720> have<00:01:54.750> seen

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:54.960 
the game he probably could have seen

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:56.719 
the game he probably could have seen
from<00:01:55.170> the<00:01:55.290> stats<00:01:55.530> stats<00:01:55.920> were<00:01:56.130> in<00:01:56.340> our<00:01:56.490> favor

00:01:56.719 --> 00:01:56.729 
from the stats stats were in our favor

00:01:56.729 --> 00:01:58.429 
from the stats stats were in our favor
so<00:01:57.030> it<00:01:57.090> was<00:01:57.270> what's<00:01:57.689> more<00:01:57.810> than<00:01:57.990> deserve<00:01:58.140> to

00:01:58.429 --> 00:01:58.439 
so it was what's more than deserve to

00:01:58.439 --> 00:02:00.410 
so it was what's more than deserve to
win<00:01:58.560> for<00:01:58.619> us<00:01:58.860> that<00:01:59.790> we<00:01:59.880> moving<00:02:00.149> into<00:02:00.329> the

in the past with ronaldinho then I in

00:02:36.960 --> 00:02:38.660

chance I came out with Howard which I

00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:42.020 
chance I came out with Howard which I
probably<00:02:41.100> shouldn't<00:02:41.490> have<00:02:41.520> done<00:02:41.730> because

00:02:42.020 --> 00:02:42.030 
probably shouldn't have done because

00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:43.910 
probably shouldn't have done because

00:04:06.800 --> 00:04:06.810 
just those random slide tackles I don't

00:04:06.810 --> 00:04:08.480 
just those random slide tackles I don't
know<00:04:06.959> what<00:04:07.350> he<00:04:07.440> was<00:04:07.560> doing<00:04:07.890> but<00:04:07.920> that<00:04:08.340> is<00:04:08.459> just

00:04:08.480 --> 00:04:08.490 
know what he was doing but that is just

00:04:08.490 --> 00:04:10.220 
know what he was doing but that is just
what<00:04:08.940> he<00:04:09.030> did<00:04:09.209> the<00:04:09.390> whole<00:04:09.420> game<00:04:09.840> long<00:04:10.050> which

00:04:10.220 --> 00:04:10.230 
what he did the whole game long which

00:04:10.230 --> 00:04:12.260 
what he did the whole game long which
was<00:04:10.380> kind<00:04:10.590> of<00:04:10.650> annoying<00:04:10.860> because<00:04:11.100> it<00:04:11.489> sort<00:04:12.120> of

00:04:12.260 --> 00:04:12.270 
was kind of annoying because it sort of

00:04:12.270 --> 00:04:15.110 
was kind of annoying because it sort of
kind<00:04:12.630> of<00:04:12.780> messes<00:04:13.590> up<00:04:13.709> your<00:04:13.739> skill<00:04:14.670> run<00:04:14.820> because

00:04:15.110 --> 00:04:15.120 
kind of messes up your skill run because

00:04:15.120 --> 00:04:16.430 
kind of messes up your skill run because
it<00:04:15.239> just<00:04:15.390> looks<00:04:15.630> really<00:04:15.900> really<00:04:16.080> dumb<00:04:16.260> when

00:04:16.430 --> 00:04:16.440 
it just looks really really dumb when

00:04:16.440 --> 00:04:18.740 
it just looks really really dumb when
your<00:04:16.560> opponent<00:04:16.950> does<00:04:17.070> it<00:04:17.220> but<00:04:17.340> anyway<00:04:17.750> 56

00:04:18.740 --> 00:04:18.750 
your opponent does it but anyway 56

00:04:18.750 --> 00:04:20.000 
your opponent does it but anyway 56
minutes<00:04:18.930> we<00:04:19.049> beat<00:04:19.290> the<00:04:19.410> goalkeeper<00:04:19.590> there

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:20.010

with a roulette again I was trying to go

00:04:21.840 --> 00:04:23.600 
with a roulette again I was trying to go
for<00:04:22.049> a<00:04:22.109> fancy<00:04:22.530> shot<00:04:22.740> but<00:04:22.890> for<00:04:23.070> some<00:04:23.220> reason

00:04:23.600 --> 00:04:23.610 
for a fancy shot but for some reason

00:04:23.610 --> 00:04:25.969 
for a fancy shot but for some reason
liat<00:04:24.570> a<00:04:24.690> wasn't<00:04:25.050> be<00:04:25.110> able<00:04:25.290> to<00:04:25.380> do<00:04:25.500> it<00:04:25.530> for<00:04:25.800> some

liat a wasn't be able to do it for some

00:04:25.979 --> 00:04:27.200 
liat a wasn't be able to do it for some
reason<00:04:26.010> which<00:04:26.340> was<00:04:26.490> weird<00:04:26.700> but<00:04:26.970> I

00:04:27.200 --> 00:04:27.210 
reason which was weird but I

00:04:27.210 --> 00:04:28.760 
reason which was weird but I

00:04:28.760 --> 00:04:28.770 
yeah we make it 6-2 it was definitely

00:04:28.770 --> 00:04:31.159 
yeah we make it 6-2 it was definitely
game<00:04:29.190> over<00:04:29.520> you<00:04:29.610> can<00:04:29.789> see<00:04:29.819> again<00:04:30.240> doing<00:04:30.930> those

00:04:31.159 --> 00:04:31.169 
game over you can see again doing those

00:04:31.169 --> 00:04:33.140 
game over you can see again doing those
random<00:04:31.470> slight<00:04:31.680> echoes<00:04:32.069> we<00:04:32.460> got<00:04:32.639> past<00:04:32.850> all<00:04:33.090> of

00:04:33.140 --> 00:04:33.150 
random slight echoes we got past all of

00:04:33.150 --> 00:04:34.820 
random slight echoes we got past all of
them<00:04:33.360> though<00:04:33.509> including<00:04:34.139> the<00:04:34.199> goalkeeper<00:04:34.800> and

00:04:34.820 --> 00:04:34.830 
them though including the goalkeeper and

00:04:34.830 --> 00:04:36.499 
them though including the goalkeeper and
we<00:04:35.039> finish<00:04:35.400> it<00:04:35.520> off<00:04:35.639> with<00:04:35.669> a<00:04:35.880> really<00:04:36.389> really

00:04:36.499 --> 00:04:36.509 
we finish it off with a really really

00:04:36.509 --> 00:04:38.749 
we finish it off with a really really
nice<00:04:36.690> shot<00:04:36.990> there<00:04:37.020> from<00:04:37.400> ronaldinho<00:04:38.400> to<00:04:38.580> make

00:04:38.749 --> 00:04:38.759 
nice shot there from ronaldinho to make

00:04:38.759 --> 00:04:41.150 
nice shot there from ronaldinho to make
it<00:04:38.940> 72<00:04:39.389> you<00:04:39.870> can<00:04:40.020> see<00:04:40.229> from<00:04:40.380> the<00:04:40.530> replay<00:04:40.949> like

00:04:41.150 --> 00:04:41.160 
it 72 you can see from the replay like

00:04:41.160 --> 00:04:42.860 
it 72 you can see from the replay like
four<00:04:41.520> players<00:04:41.819> at<00:04:41.970> the<00:04:42.030> same<00:04:42.270> time<00:04:42.479> doing<00:04:42.810> a

00:04:42.860 --> 00:04:42.870 
four players at the same time doing a

00:04:42.870 --> 00:04:45.080 
four players at the same time doing a
slide<00:04:43.080> tackle<00:04:43.470> it<00:04:43.949> looks<00:04:44.220> so<00:04:44.370> dumb<00:04:44.610> but<00:04:44.880> I'm

00:04:45.080 --> 00:04:45.090 
slide tackle it looks so dumb but I'm

00:04:45.090 --> 00:04:46.969 
slide tackle it looks so dumb but I'm
still<00:04:45.389> a<00:04:45.419> pretty<00:04:45.660> sweet<00:04:45.900> goal<00:04:46.139> I<00:04:46.169> guess<00:04:46.440> then<00:04:46.949> a

00:04:46.969 --> 00:04:46.979 
still a pretty sweet goal I guess then a

00:04:46.979 --> 00:04:49.100 
still a pretty sweet goal I guess then a
66<00:04:47.819> minute<00:04:48.060> again<00:04:48.300> ronaldinho<00:04:48.840> on<00:04:48.900> the<00:04:48.990> ball

00:04:49.100 --> 00:04:49.110 
66 minute again ronaldinho on the ball

00:04:49.110 --> 00:04:50.450 
66 minute again ronaldinho on the ball
he<00:04:49.259> went<00:04:49.410> with<00:04:49.560> a<00:04:49.620> slide<00:04:49.919> tackle<00:04:50.280> where<00:04:50.370> we

00:04:50.450 --> 00:04:50.460 
he went with a slide tackle where we

00:04:50.460 --> 00:04:53.059 
he went with a slide tackle where we
actually<00:04:50.639> hit<00:04:50.940> I<00:04:51.000> think<00:04:51.389> Alex<00:04:51.840> xsarahx<00:04:52.259> who

00:04:53.059 --> 00:04:53.069 
actually hit I think Alex xsarahx who

00:04:53.069 --> 00:04:54.290 
actually hit I think Alex xsarahx who
was<00:04:53.190> not<00:04:53.370> controlling<00:04:53.849> the<00:04:53.940> ball<00:04:54.060> and

00:04:54.290 --> 00:04:54.300 
was not controlling the ball and

00:04:54.300 --> 00:04:55.640 
was not controlling the ball and
therefore<00:04:54.720> he<00:04:54.840> actually<00:04:54.960> picked<00:04:55.289> up<00:04:55.470> base

00:04:55.640 --> 00:04:55.650 
therefore he actually picked up base

00:04:55.650 --> 00:04:57.770 
therefore he actually picked up base
second<00:04:56.310> breath<00:04:56.490> guard<00:04:56.729> and<00:04:57.060> from<00:04:57.569> that<00:04:57.720> point

00:04:57.770 --> 00:04:57.780 
second breath guard and from that point

00:04:57.780 --> 00:05:00.770 
second breath guard and from that point
he<00:04:58.349> just<00:04:58.680> started<00:04:59.280> picking<00:04:59.610> up<00:04:59.729> red<00:05:00.419> guards

00:05:00.770 --> 00:05:00.780 
he just started picking up red guards

00:05:00.780 --> 00:05:02.330 
he just started picking up red guards
left<00:05:00.960> right<00:05:01.169> and<00:05:01.320> center<00:05:01.620> because<00:05:01.800> again<00:05:02.190> we

00:05:02.330 --> 00:05:02.340 
left right and center because again we

00:05:02.340 --> 00:05:03.830 
left right and center because again we
got<00:05:02.460> through<00:05:02.669> this<00:05:02.699> time<00:05:02.880> with<00:05:03.060> Leah<00:05:03.300> he<00:05:03.630> went

00:05:03.830 --> 00:05:03.840 
got through this time with Leah he went

00:05:03.840 --> 00:05:05.930 
got through this time with Leah he went

00:05:05.930 --> 00:05:05.940 
with another tackle and he picked up his

00:05:05.940 --> 00:05:08.930 
with another tackle and he picked up his
third<00:05:06.570> red<00:05:06.990> cart<00:05:07.320> of<00:05:07.470> the<00:05:07.620> game<00:05:07.830> and<00:05:08.039> I<00:05:08.759> don't

00:05:10.520 --> 00:05:10.530 
know if that was a red card but still it

00:05:10.530 --> 00:05:12.080 
know if that was a red card but still it
was<00:05:10.650> a<00:05:10.680> third<00:05:10.949> one<00:05:11.160> he<00:05:11.310> picked<00:05:11.460> up<00:05:11.580> a<00:05:11.669> penalty

the<00:05:29.400> time<00:05:29.430> that<00:05:29.849> the<00:05:30.330> first<00:05:30.569> one<00:05:30.780> would<00:05:31.020> have

00:05:31.159 --> 00:05:31.169 
the time that the first one would have

00:05:31.169 --> 00:05:32.420 
the time that the first one would have
meant<00:05:31.349> that<00:05:31.470> we<00:05:31.590> actually<00:05:31.740> had<00:05:31.979> to<00:05:32.070> leave<00:05:32.250> the

00:05:32.420 --> 00:05:32.430 
meant that we actually had to leave the

00:05:32.430 --> 00:05:34.010 
meant that we actually had to leave the
game<00:05:32.460> which<00:05:32.789> never<00:05:33.030> happened<00:05:33.389> before<00:05:33.690> for<00:05:33.900> me

00:05:34.010 --> 00:05:34.020 
game which never happened before for me

00:05:34.020 --> 00:05:36.080 
game which never happened before for me
in<00:05:34.229> an<00:05:34.560> online<00:05:34.710> game<00:05:34.919> anyway<00:05:35.490> but<00:05:35.759> luckily

00:05:36.080 --> 00:05:36.090 
in an online game anyway but luckily

00:05:36.090 --> 00:05:38.270 
in an online game anyway but luckily
enough<00:05:36.360> that<00:05:36.539> didn't<00:05:36.810> happen<00:05:37.050> then<00:05:37.590> 84th

00:05:38.270 --> 00:05:38.280 
enough that didn't happen then 84th

00:05:38.280 --> 00:05:39.649 
enough that didn't happen then 84th

from<00:05:41.550> ronaldinho<00:05:42.090> to<00:05:42.270> Alex<00:05:42.570> xsarahx<00:05:42.930> I

00:05:43.129 --> 00:05:43.139 
from ronaldinho to Alex xsarahx I

00:05:43.139 --> 00:05:44.629 
from ronaldinho to Alex xsarahx I
probably<00:05:43.500> should<00:05:43.680> have<00:05:43.830> taken<00:05:44.039> a<00:05:44.219> shot<00:05:44.370> right

00:05:44.629 --> 00:05:44.639 
probably should have taken a shot right

00:05:44.639 --> 00:05:46.969 
probably should have taken a shot right
there<00:05:44.669> I<00:05:45.060> took<00:05:45.240> way<00:05:45.990> too<00:05:46.020> much<00:05:46.380> time<00:05:46.650> which<00:05:46.860> was

00:05:46.969 --> 00:05:46.979 
there I took way too much time which was

00:05:46.979 --> 00:05:48.499 
there I took way too much time which was
so<00:05:47.250> dumb<00:05:47.520> because<00:05:47.669> what<00:05:48.090> it<00:05:48.180> would<00:05:48.360> have<00:05:48.389> been

00:05:48.499 --> 00:05:48.509 
so dumb because what it would have been

00:05:48.509 --> 00:05:50.180 
so dumb because what it would have been
a<00:05:48.630> great<00:05:48.810> opportunity<00:05:48.930> to<00:05:49.500> actually<00:05:49.710> get<00:05:50.009> that

00:05:50.180 --> 00:05:50.190 
a great opportunity to actually get that

00:05:50.190 --> 00:05:52.279 
a great opportunity to actually get that
goal<00:05:50.400> but<00:05:50.610> I<00:05:50.789> completely<00:05:51.270> filled<00:05:51.810> it<00:05:51.990> then

00:05:52.279 --> 00:05:52.289 
goal but I completely filled it then

00:05:52.289 --> 00:05:54.260 
goal but I completely filled it then
88th<00:05:52.860> minute<00:05:52.889> I<00:05:53.280> tried<00:05:53.610> to<00:05:53.789> a<00:05:53.820> rainbow<00:05:54.210> flag

00:05:54.260 --> 00:05:54.270 
88th minute I tried to a rainbow flag

00:05:54.270 --> 00:05:56.270 
88th minute I tried to a rainbow flag
the<00:05:54.509> goalkeeper<00:05:55.020> I<00:05:55.050> also<00:05:55.229> feel<00:05:55.680> that<00:05:55.710> that<00:05:56.039> but

00:05:56.270 --> 00:05:56.280 
the goalkeeper I also feel that that but

00:05:56.280 --> 00:05:58.399 
the goalkeeper I also feel that that but
still<00:05:56.550> we<00:05:57.120> picked<00:05:57.389> up<00:05:57.449> another<00:05:57.750> penalty<00:05:58.139> the

00:05:58.399 --> 00:05:58.409

time<00:06:02.310> the<00:06:02.639> goalkeeper<00:06:03.090> saves<00:06:03.270> it<00:06:03.479> once<00:06:03.750> again

00:06:03.920 --> 00:06:03.930

00:06:25.969 --> 00:06:25.979 
Greece one you might notice it from the

00:06:25.979 --> 00:06:27.620 
Greece one you might notice it from the
gameplay<00:06:26.340> like<00:06:26.580> there<00:06:26.820> was<00:06:26.969> a<00:06:27.000> little<00:06:27.449> bit<00:06:27.539> of

00:06:27.620 --> 00:06:27.630 
gameplay like there was a little bit of

00:06:27.630 --> 00:06:30.050 
gameplay like there was a little bit of
lag<00:06:27.900> and<00:06:28.139> that<00:06:28.680> was<00:06:28.860> just<00:06:29.070> so<00:06:29.610> annoyed<00:06:29.940> you

00:06:30.050 --> 00:06:30.060 
lag and that was just so annoyed you

00:06:30.060 --> 00:06:32.450 
lag and that was just so annoyed you
play<00:06:30.270> that<00:06:30.419> this<00:06:30.630> game<00:06:30.870> also<00:06:31.139> was<00:06:31.469> just<00:06:31.710> so<00:06:32.159> so

00:06:32.450 --> 00:06:32.460 
play that this game also was just so so

00:06:32.460 --> 00:06:34.670 
play that this game also was just so so
boring<00:06:32.880> just<00:06:32.909> like<00:06:33.210> the<00:06:33.330> first<00:06:33.360> one<00:06:33.780> not<00:06:34.500> a<00:06:34.560> lot

00:06:34.670 --> 00:06:34.680 
boring just like the first one not a lot

00:06:34.680 --> 00:06:36.050 
boring just like the first one not a lot
of<00:06:34.710> stuff<00:06:35.009> happens<00:06:35.370> my<00:06:35.490> opponent<00:06:35.849> got<00:06:35.940> the

defender I wasn't really able to do skin
was<00:06:43.470> much<00:06:43.710> since<00:06:44.130> it<00:06:44.220> was<00:06:44.340> just<00:06:44.580> so

00:06:44.810 --> 00:06:44.820 
was much since it was just so

00:06:44.820 --> 00:06:46.460

frustrating<00:06:45.330> to<00:06:45.360> play<00:06:45.600> what<00:06:45.840> sort<00:06:46.080> of<00:06:46.170> blood

00:06:46.460 --> 00:06:46.470 
frustrating to play what sort of blood

from<00:06:48.390> the<00:06:48.540> gameplay<00:06:48.900> slightly<00:06:49.380> but<00:06:49.590> we<00:06:50.010> make

00:06:50.180 --> 00:06:50.190 
from the gameplay slightly but we make

00:06:50.190 --> 00:06:51.620

00:07:13.280 --> 00:07:13.290 
only one little victory for us as I said

00:07:13.290 --> 00:07:15.470 
only one little victory for us as I said
before<00:07:13.320> not<00:07:13.800> the<00:07:13.920> most<00:07:14.100> exciting<00:07:14.310> game<00:07:14.700> mainly

00:07:15.470 --> 00:07:15.480 
before not the most exciting game mainly

00:07:15.480 --> 00:07:17.240 
before not the most exciting game mainly
because<00:07:15.720> of<00:07:15.870> the<00:07:15.990> lag<00:07:16.260> it<00:07:16.470> which<00:07:16.620> it<00:07:16.890> is<00:07:17.040> just

00:07:17.240 --> 00:07:17.250 
because of the lag it which it is just

00:07:17.250 --> 00:07:18.590 
because of the lag it which it is just
really<00:07:17.550> really<00:07:17.640> annoying<00:07:18.000> to<00:07:18.030> actually<00:07:18.360> pull

00:07:18.590 --> 00:07:18.600 
really really annoying to actually pull

00:07:18.600 --> 00:07:20.360 
really really annoying to actually pull
off<00:07:18.690> skill<00:07:18.990> moves<00:07:19.230> when<00:07:19.560> when<00:07:19.980> the<00:07:20.100> game<00:07:20.250> is

00:07:20.360 --> 00:07:20.370 
off skill moves when when the game is

00:07:20.370 --> 00:07:21.800 
off skill moves when when the game is
really<00:07:20.640> really<00:07:20.790> lucky<00:07:21.090> because<00:07:21.270> it<00:07:21.600> is<00:07:21.690> all

00:07:21.800 --> 00:07:21.810 
really really lucky because it is all

00:07:21.810 --> 00:07:23.870 
really really lucky because it is all
about<00:07:21.900> timing<00:07:22.200> and<00:07:22.560> when<00:07:23.130> there's<00:07:23.310> like<00:07:23.580> it<00:07:23.790> is

00:07:23.870 --> 00:07:23.880 
about timing and when there's like it is

00:07:23.880 --> 00:07:25.520 
about timing and when there's like it is
simply<00:07:24.390> impossible<00:07:24.420> to<00:07:25.110> actually<00:07:25.200> time

00:07:25.520 --> 00:07:25.530 
simply impossible to actually time

00:07:25.530 --> 00:07:27.530 
simply impossible to actually time
something<00:07:25.950> right<00:07:26.100> but<00:07:26.640> anyway<00:07:26.880> that<00:07:27.150> is<00:07:27.180> so<00:07:27.390> it

00:07:27.530 --> 00:07:27.540 
something right but anyway that is so it

00:07:27.540 --> 00:07:28.940 
something right but anyway that is so it
all<00:07:27.660> and<00:07:27.840> as<00:07:27.930> we<00:07:28.050> move<00:07:28.200> it<00:07:28.320> to<00:07:28.380> the<00:07:28.500> scale<00:07:28.740> us<00:07:28.830> up

00:07:28.940 --> 00:07:28.950 
all and as we move it to the scale us up

00:07:28.950 --> 00:07:30.620 
all and as we move it to the scale us up
you<00:07:29.070> can<00:07:29.250> see<00:07:29.460> we're<00:07:29.940> currently<00:07:30.060> on<00:07:30.240> seven

00:07:30.620 --> 00:07:30.630
