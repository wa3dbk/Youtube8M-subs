everything is pre-installed so we've got

00:00:53.539 --> 00:00:54.880 
everything is pre-installed so we've got
the<00:00:53.629> speed<00:00:53.840> control<00:00:54.140> electronics<00:00:54.739> being

00:00:54.880 --> 00:00:54.890 
the speed control electronics being

00:00:54.890 --> 00:00:57.099 
the speed control electronics being
control<00:00:55.129> at<00:00:55.250> the<00:00:55.340> top<00:00:55.519> here<00:00:55.760> the<00:00:56.750> battery<00:00:56.929> is

00:00:57.099 --> 00:00:57.109 
control at the top here the battery is

00:00:57.109 --> 00:00:59.139 
control at the top here the battery is
already<00:00:57.230> in<00:00:57.500> here<00:00:57.769> this<00:00:57.980> use<00:00:58.399> the<00:00:58.609> easy<00:00:58.940> three

00:00:59.139 --> 00:00:59.149 
already in here this use the easy three

00:00:59.149 --> 00:01:01.000 
already in here this use the easy three
connectors<00:00:59.570> I'm<00:01:00.320> just<00:01:00.649> a<00:01:00.679> nickel<00:01:00.949> metal

connectors I'm just a nickel metal
hydride<00:01:01.190> 7.2<00:01:02.059> volt<00:01:02.329> but<00:01:02.600> that's<00:01:02.750> um

00:01:03.310 --> 00:01:03.320 
hydride 7.2 volt but that's um

00:01:03.320 --> 00:01:05.070 
hydride 7.2 volt but that's um
plenty<00:01:03.980> enough<00:01:04.040> for<00:01:04.310> this<00:01:04.400> style<00:01:04.610> of<00:01:04.820> vehicle

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:05.080 
plenty enough for this style of vehicle

00:01:05.080 --> 00:01:08.110 
plenty enough for this style of vehicle

00:01:08.110 --> 00:01:08.120 
at the back here we've got a brushed 15

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:10.090 
at the back here we've got a brushed 15
turn<00:01:08.390> motor<00:01:08.660> so<00:01:09.050> that<00:01:09.140> runs<00:01:09.320> the<00:01:09.470> gearbox<00:01:09.830> and

00:01:10.090 --> 00:01:10.100 
turn motor so that runs the gearbox and

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:11.710 
turn motor so that runs the gearbox and
this<00:01:10.490> vehicle<00:01:10.700> being<00:01:10.970> rear<00:01:11.180> wheel<00:01:11.270> drive<00:01:11.450> runs

00:01:11.710 --> 00:01:11.720 
this vehicle being rear wheel drive runs

00:01:11.720 --> 00:01:15.910 
this vehicle being rear wheel drive runs
the<00:01:11.930> backs<00:01:12.110> work<00:01:12.320> back<00:01:12.560> wheels<00:01:12.800> so<00:01:13.790> again<00:01:14.920> nice

00:01:15.910 --> 00:01:15.920 
the backs work back wheels so again nice

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:18.400 
the backs work back wheels so again nice
people<00:01:16.220> to<00:01:16.310> have<00:01:16.400> heaps<00:01:16.580> of<00:01:16.700> fun<00:01:16.850> with<00:01:17.350> one<00:01:18.350> of

00:01:18.400 --> 00:01:18.410 
people to have heaps of fun with one of

00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:19.570 
people to have heaps of fun with one of
the<00:01:18.470> great<00:01:18.650> things<00:01:18.830> about<00:01:18.890> the<00:01:19.100> torment<00:01:19.460> is

00:01:19.570 --> 00:01:19.580 
the great things about the torment is

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:21.280 
the great things about the torment is
you've<00:01:19.790> got<00:01:19.970> these<00:01:20.090> big<00:01:20.420> I<00:01:20.690> suppose<00:01:21.080> you<00:01:21.170> could

00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:21.290 
you've got these big I suppose you could

00:01:21.290 --> 00:01:23.590 
you've got these big I suppose you could
say<00:01:21.410> ball<00:01:21.620> bar<00:01:21.800> or<00:01:21.950> bash<00:01:22.160> guards<00:01:22.640> so<00:01:23.240> this<00:01:23.450> will

00:01:23.590 --> 00:01:23.600 
say ball bar or bash guards so this will

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:24.880 
say ball bar or bash guards so this will
also<00:01:23.720> reduce<00:01:23.960> damage<00:01:24.500> if<00:01:24.650> you're<00:01:24.740> just

00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:24.890 
also reduce damage if you're just

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:26.950 
also reduce damage if you're just
running<00:01:25.040> around<00:01:25.190> in<00:01:25.550> let's<00:01:26.360> say<00:01:26.510> paddocks

00:01:26.950 --> 00:01:26.960 
running around in let's say paddocks

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:29.770 
running around in let's say paddocks
backyards<00:01:27.620> around<00:01:28.400> trees<00:01:28.730> rather<00:01:29.600> than

00:01:29.770 --> 00:01:29.780 
backyards around trees rather than

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:31.270 
backyards around trees rather than
taking<00:01:29.990> off<00:01:30.170> a<00:01:30.260> suspension<00:01:30.650> arm<00:01:30.950> you<00:01:31.040> sort<00:01:31.250> of

00:01:31.270 --> 00:01:31.280 
taking off a suspension arm you sort of

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:32.710 
taking off a suspension arm you sort of
bump<00:01:31.490> this<00:01:31.610> into<00:01:31.880> it<00:01:32.000> and<00:01:32.120> that'll<00:01:32.300> save<00:01:32.510> it

00:01:32.710 --> 00:01:32.720 
bump this into it and that'll save it

00:01:32.720 --> 00:01:35.350 
bump this into it and that'll save it
and<00:01:33.080> again<00:01:33.560> the<00:01:33.680> same<00:01:33.890> thing<00:01:34.100> on<00:01:34.220> the<00:01:34.310> back<00:01:34.460> so

00:01:35.350 --> 00:01:35.360 
and again the same thing on the back so

00:01:35.360 --> 00:01:37.510 
and again the same thing on the back so
this<00:01:35.690> makes<00:01:35.900> it<00:01:36.050> a<00:01:36.110> very<00:01:36.200> strong<00:01:36.380> car<00:01:36.800> and<00:01:37.130> very

00:01:37.510 --> 00:01:37.520 
this makes it a very strong car and very

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:38.170 
this makes it a very strong car and very
durable

00:01:38.170 --> 00:01:38.180 
durable

00:01:38.180 --> 00:01:39.580 
durable
another<00:01:38.690> thing<00:01:38.870> that'll<00:01:39.110> make<00:01:39.230> this<00:01:39.320> car

00:01:39.580 --> 00:01:39.590 
another thing that'll make this car

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:41.440 
another thing that'll make this car
handle<00:01:39.920> really<00:01:40.220> good<00:01:40.460> on<00:01:40.550> rough<00:01:40.730> terrain<00:01:41.090> and

00:01:41.440 --> 00:01:41.450 
handle really good on rough terrain and

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:43.510 
handle really good on rough terrain and
the<00:01:42.290> shock<00:01:42.500> absorbers<00:01:42.920> that<00:01:42.950> are<00:01:43.100> included<00:01:43.490> so

00:01:43.510 --> 00:01:43.520 
the shock absorbers that are included so

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:45.580 
the shock absorbers that are included so
these<00:01:43.850> here<00:01:44.090> long<00:01:44.630> travel<00:01:45.020> and<00:01:45.260> their<00:01:45.560> oil

00:01:45.580 --> 00:01:45.590 
these here long travel and their oil

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:47.320 
these here long travel and their oil
field<00:01:46.010> as<00:01:46.160> well<00:01:46.280> so<00:01:46.610> they<00:01:46.730> do<00:01:46.790> a<00:01:46.910> really<00:01:47.150> good

00:01:47.320 --> 00:01:47.330
