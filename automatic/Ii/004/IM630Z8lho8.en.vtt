00:00:00.149 --> 00:00:00.649
 Imagine you think the land is flat for the first 18 years of your life. 

00:00:03.370 --> 00:00:06.960
 Through your elementary and even high school studies you hear about the 

00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:10.759
 Flat land on which we live and you solve the dull flat land duties. Then (if you're lucky) 

00:00:10.759 --> 00:00:14.129
 Go to the university and be surprised! For the first time in your life you see it spherical 

00:00:14.129 --> 00:00:17.119
 They tell you: I'm sorry to lie to you, the earth is spherical in fact. 

00:00:17.119 --> 00:00:19.970
 This is unfortunately 

00:00:19.970 --> 00:00:21.029

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:23.880
 1. Gravity. Mostly, I learned that objects are attracted to each other 

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:27.630
 Depending on their mass, therefore you arise and you calculate that light can not 

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:32.630
 Be affected by gravity because light does not block it. I thought so. Expect what. 

00:00:32.630 --> 00:00:38.290
 The source of gravity is not mass but energy and momentum, both possessed by light. (Of course the natural mass also has) 

00:00:38.290 --> 00:00:42.710
 So the light does not just deviate from the star, planet or black hole 

00:00:42.710 --> 00:00:47.000
 And even attracts the planet and the star and the black hole in return. 

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:51.280
 Certainly this quantity is very small. But even small quantities are not zero. 

00:00:51.280 --> 00:00:54.980
 Anyway, the point is that Newton's laws of gravity are just a good enough approximation 

00:00:54.980 --> 00:00:58.170
 Let us reach the moon but not complete. General relativity is better. 

00:00:58.170 --> 00:00:59.120
 2) Theory of Relativity. 

00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:03.210
 Speaking of the moon, I have often learned that a lamb moves at 2 mph (3.2 km / h) 

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:07.190
 For the train, the train moves at 2 mph (3.2 km / h) to the ground and in the same direction as the lamb 

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:14.190
 Means that the lamb moves at 4 mph relative to the Earth. 2 miles \ x 2 miles \ x = 4 miles \ o, right? Error. 

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:18.190
 Experiments in special relativity have shown that velocities do not simply combine 

00:01:18.190 --> 00:01:22.940
 The lamb will actually move just under 4 mph 

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:26.820
 Ratio of land. The equation predicts the difference from 

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:33.820
 The combination of velocities is: (v1 * v2 / c ^ 2) +1) / (v1 + v2)) has no significant effect, but 

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:36.040
 The earth looks flat, does not it? 

00:01:36.040 --> 00:01:41.640
 But the ground is not flat. If I walked 10,000 kilometers from my cat and you walk 

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:48.640
 10,000 extra kilometers, you are not 20,000 km from my cat, you are 12.750 km away. In fact 

00:01:48.799 --> 00:01:55.159
 The farthest distance you can get away from the stuff on the ground is 12,750 km. It is "the limit of the earthly dimension." 

00:01:55.159 --> 00:01:59.420
 But we call it Earth. So similar, when you try 

00:01:59.420 --> 00:02:05.000
 Collecting two speeds together, there is a "cosmic speed limit" of 300,000,000 meters per second. 

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:05.900
 It is the speed of light. 

00:02:05.900 --> 00:02:10.149
 So, just because our eyes see the earth flat and the speeds seem to be simply grouped together 

00:02:10.149 --> 00:02:13.519
 And the light seems to be not attractive, this is an excuse 

00:02:13.519 --> 00:02:20.519
 To lie to ourselves and to our children about the nature of things? No
