blood worms into the fish tank when you

00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:18.539 
blood worms into the fish tank when you
have<00:02:16.019> creditor<00:02:17.019> fish<00:02:17.200> in<00:02:17.350> there<00:02:17.590> they<00:02:18.400> usually

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:22.480 
get a taste of our eating meat and then

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:29.789 
get a taste of our eating meat and then
may<00:02:23.220> for<00:02:24.220> example<00:02:25.080> the<00:02:26.080> black<00:02:26.290> Oscars<00:02:26.860> or<00:02:28.799> the
