killed by that but the problem is if you
don't<00:01:36.659> have<00:01:36.750> a<00:01:36.810> lot<00:01:36.840> of<00:01:37.110> ammo<00:01:37.610> so<00:01:38.610> we<00:01:39.320> we<00:01:40.320> gotta

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:40.530 
don't have a lot of ammo so we we gotta

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:41.870 
don't have a lot of ammo so we we gotta
start<00:01:40.799> setting<00:01:41.130> traps<00:01:41.310> and<00:01:41.640> trying<00:01:41.790> to

00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:41.880 
start setting traps and trying to

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:43.520 
start setting traps and trying to
conserve<00:01:42.150> as<00:01:42.360> much<00:01:42.390> ammo<00:01:42.750> as<00:01:42.840> we<00:01:43.079> can<00:01:43.290> because

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:43.530 
conserve as much ammo as we can because

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:45.649 
conserve as much ammo as we can because
going<00:01:44.430> into<00:01:44.640> the<00:01:44.729> later<00:01:44.909> rounds<00:01:45.149> it<00:01:45.509> gets

00:01:45.649 --> 00:01:45.659 
going into the later rounds it gets

00:01:45.659 --> 00:01:48.050 
going into the later rounds it gets
really<00:01:45.840> difficult<00:01:46.079> with<00:01:46.530> that<00:01:46.710> because<00:01:47.060> you

00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:48.060 
really difficult with that because you

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:50.810 
really difficult with that because you
gotta<00:01:48.240> use<00:01:48.450> almost<00:01:48.920> your<00:01:49.920> entire<00:01:49.950> guns<00:01:50.549> worth

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:50.820 
gotta use almost your entire guns worth

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:52.429 
gotta use almost your entire guns worth
every<00:01:51.149> round<00:01:51.360> to<00:01:51.630> get<00:01:51.780> through<00:01:51.960> the<00:01:52.079> zombies

get ten shot you get ten points per
bullet<00:03:35.870> so<00:03:36.170> if<00:03:36.430> you<00:03:37.430> turn<00:03:37.670> on<00:03:37.820> a<00:03:37.850> trap<00:03:38.209> and

spray into the trap you can make

00:03:39.910 --> 00:03:46.330 
spray into the trap you can make
thousands<00:03:40.910> of<00:03:41.120> points<00:03:42.190> really<00:03:43.190> fast<00:03:45.160> so<00:03:46.160> right

00:03:46.330 --> 00:03:46.340 
thousands of points really fast so right

00:03:46.340 --> 00:03:48.160 
thousands of points really fast so right

00:03:54.550 --> 00:03:54.560 
really really good tip that that really

00:03:54.560 --> 00:03:56.590 
really really good tip that that really
makes<00:03:54.739> things<00:03:54.980> a<00:03:55.070> lot<00:03:55.160> easier<00:03:55.220> is<00:03:55.760> once<00:03:56.480> you

00:03:56.590 --> 00:03:56.600 
makes things a lot easier is once you

00:03:56.600 --> 00:04:00.910 
makes things a lot easier is once you
get<00:03:56.780> past<00:03:56.810> about<00:03:57.290> level<00:03:57.880> 23<00:03:59.410> all<00:04:00.410> the<00:04:00.739> zombies

trying to do is as you can see I'm

00:04:07.519 --> 00:04:11.170 
trying to do is as you can see I'm
always<00:04:07.760> shooting<00:04:08.150> at<00:04:09.019> the<00:04:09.260> ground<00:04:09.730> there<00:04:10.730> is

00:04:11.170 --> 00:04:11.180 
always shooting at the ground there is

00:04:11.180 --> 00:04:12.759 
always shooting at the ground there is
going<00:04:11.510> to<00:04:11.600> be<00:04:11.630> crawling<00:04:12.019> with<00:04:12.079> the<00:04:12.230> ground<00:04:12.470> and

00:04:12.759 --> 00:04:12.769 
going to be crawling with the ground and

00:04:12.769 --> 00:04:14.349 
going to be crawling with the ground and
also<00:04:13.130> if<00:04:13.250> you<00:04:13.370> shoot<00:04:13.579> the<00:04:13.790> zombies<00:04:14.150> in<00:04:14.269> the

00:04:14.349 --> 00:04:14.359 
also if you shoot the zombies in the

00:04:14.359 --> 00:04:17.199 
also if you shoot the zombies in the
legs<00:04:14.630> they<00:04:15.049> turn<00:04:15.470> into<00:04:15.650> crawler<00:04:16.040> so<00:04:16.430> a<00:04:16.699> lot

00:04:17.199 --> 00:04:17.209 
legs they turn into crawler so a lot

00:04:17.209 --> 00:04:19.120 
legs they turn into crawler so a lot
easy<00:04:17.449> to<00:04:17.660> manage<00:04:18.040> the

00:04:19.120 --> 00:04:19.130 
easy to manage the

00:04:19.130 --> 00:04:21.100 
easy to manage the
really<00:04:19.459> slow<00:04:19.790> and<00:04:20.060> and<00:04:20.360> it's<00:04:20.540> usually<00:04:20.930> one<00:04:21.050> or

00:04:21.100 --> 00:04:21.110 
really slow and and it's usually one or

00:04:21.110 --> 00:04:23.470 
really slow and and it's usually one or
two<00:04:21.320> shots<00:04:21.560> from<00:04:21.709> there<00:04:21.890> anyways<00:04:22.280> so<00:04:23.000> you<00:04:23.060> just

00:04:23.470 --> 00:04:23.480 
two shots from there anyways so you just

00:04:23.480 --> 00:04:25.030 
two shots from there anyways so you just
have<00:04:23.630> a<00:04:23.660> lot<00:04:23.810> more<00:04:23.960> time<00:04:24.170> to<00:04:24.290> run<00:04:24.470> around<00:04:24.590> and<00:04:25.010> a

00:04:25.030 --> 00:04:25.040 
have a lot more time to run around and a

00:04:25.040 --> 00:04:28.630 
have a lot more time to run around and a
lot<00:04:25.340> more<00:04:26.050> ways<00:04:27.050> to<00:04:27.080> maneuver<00:04:27.680> and<00:04:28.250> as<00:04:28.400> you<00:04:28.520> can

00:04:28.630 --> 00:04:28.640 
lot more ways to maneuver and as you can

00:04:28.640 --> 00:04:30.610 
lot more ways to maneuver and as you can
see<00:04:28.670> there<00:04:28.910> I<00:04:28.940> ran<00:04:29.240> past<00:04:29.510> maybe<00:04:29.780> 20<00:04:30.200> zombies

00:05:00.430 --> 00:05:00.440 
especially for for is definitely the

00:05:00.440 --> 00:05:02.980 
especially for for is definitely the

00:05:02.980 --> 00:05:02.990 
most difficult play to play zombies

00:05:02.990 --> 00:05:06.010 
most difficult play to play zombies
which<00:05:03.890> was<00:05:04.160> what<00:05:04.670> this<00:05:05.150> was<00:05:05.210> as<00:05:05.660> you<00:05:05.780> can<00:05:05.900> see

00:05:06.010 --> 00:05:06.020 
which was what this was as you can see

00:05:06.020 --> 00:05:07.990 
which was what this was as you can see
have<00:05:06.110> 36<00:05:06.710> revives<00:05:07.070> and<00:05:07.370> with<00:05:07.520> the<00:05:07.610> ball<00:05:07.760> knife

have 36 revives and with the ball knife

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:10.570 
have 36 revives and with the ball knife
so<00:05:08.360> you<00:05:09.320> can<00:05:09.530> see<00:05:09.680> that<00:05:09.800> we<00:05:09.890> struggled<00:05:10.340> at<00:05:10.460> the

00:05:10.570 --> 00:05:10.580 
so you can see that we struggled at the

00:05:10.580 --> 00:05:11.860 
so you can see that we struggled at the
beginning<00:05:10.820> but<00:05:10.940> because<00:05:11.420> I<00:05:11.450> have<00:05:11.630> the<00:05:11.720> ball

00:05:11.860 --> 00:05:11.870 
beginning but because I have the ball

00:05:11.870 --> 00:05:15.490 
beginning but because I have the ball
neck<00:05:12.110> we<00:05:12.710> made<00:05:13.550> it<00:05:13.580> through<00:05:13.700> it<00:05:13.990> but<00:05:14.990> you

00:05:15.490 --> 00:05:15.500 
neck we made it through it but you

00:05:15.500 --> 00:05:19.660 
neck we made it through it but you
cannot<00:05:15.920> lose<00:05:17.290> somebody<00:05:18.290> you<00:05:18.680> can't<00:05:19.460> leave

00:05:19.660 --> 00:05:19.670 
cannot lose somebody you can't leave

00:05:19.670 --> 00:05:21.400 
cannot lose somebody you can't leave
them<00:05:19.820> revived<00:05:20.210> and<00:05:20.480> died<00:05:20.930> for<00:05:20.960> the<00:05:21.260> round

00:05:21.400 --> 00:05:21.410 
them revived and died for the round

00:05:21.410 --> 00:05:23.170 
them revived and died for the round
because<00:05:21.590> the<00:05:21.800> box<00:05:21.980> isn't<00:05:22.250> very<00:05:22.550> forgiving<00:05:23.030> so

00:05:23.170 --> 00:05:23.180 
because the box isn't very forgiving so

00:05:23.180 --> 00:05:24.840 
because the box isn't very forgiving so
once<00:05:23.360> they<00:05:23.510> go<00:05:23.630> down<00:05:23.750> and<00:05:23.990> lose<00:05:24.140> their<00:05:24.290> weapons

00:05:24.840 --> 00:05:24.850 
once they go down and lose their weapons

00:05:24.850 --> 00:05:27.220 
once they go down and lose their weapons
they're<00:05:25.850> usually<00:05:26.060> just<00:05:26.450> a<00:05:26.570> pile<00:05:26.780> on<00:05:26.990> for<00:05:27.170> the

00:05:27.220 --> 00:05:27.230 
they're usually just a pile on for the

00:05:27.230 --> 00:05:31.000 
they're usually just a pile on for the
rest<00:05:27.380> of<00:05:27.500> the<00:05:27.590> game<00:05:27.770> and<00:05:28.150> and<00:05:29.740> yeah<00:05:30.740> they're

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:31.010 
rest of the game and and yeah they're

00:05:31.010 --> 00:05:32.560 
rest of the game and and yeah they're
basically<00:05:31.310> useless<00:05:31.580> and<00:05:32.030> now<00:05:32.120> it<00:05:32.450> was

00:05:32.560 --> 00:05:32.570 
basically useless and now it was

00:05:32.570 --> 00:05:34.630 
basically useless and now it was
severely<00:05:33.020> short<00:05:33.320> in<00:05:33.410> your<00:05:33.530> game<00:05:33.680> so<00:05:33.950> what<00:05:34.550> you
