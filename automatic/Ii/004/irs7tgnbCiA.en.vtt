00:00:08.930 --> 00:00:08.940 
focusing on plane stance as a lot of

00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:11.749 
focusing on plane stance as a lot of
people<00:00:09.210> I<00:00:09.300> requested<00:00:09.809> that<00:00:10.040> so<00:00:11.040> planes<00:00:11.400> dance

00:00:11.749 --> 00:00:11.759 
people I requested that so planes dance

00:00:11.759 --> 00:00:13.640 
people I requested that so planes dance
well<00:00:12.090> the<00:00:12.269> first<00:00:12.509> type<00:00:12.719> of<00:00:12.750> stunts<00:00:13.139> I<00:00:13.259> did<00:00:13.500> do

00:00:13.640 --> 00:00:13.650 
well the first type of stunts I did do

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:15.829 
well the first type of stunts I did do
in<00:00:13.769> this<00:00:13.860> game<00:00:13.980> and<00:00:14.610> this<00:00:15.000> is<00:00:15.120> the<00:00:15.240> location<00:00:15.599> of

00:00:15.829 --> 00:00:15.839 
in this game and this is the location of

00:00:15.839 --> 00:00:17.840 
in this game and this is the location of
the<00:00:15.900> first<00:00:16.199> stunt<00:00:16.410> I<00:00:16.590> we<00:00:16.800> did<00:00:16.980> which<00:00:17.820> was

00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:17.850 
the first stunt I we did which was

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:20.689 
the first stunt I we did which was
through<00:00:18.300> this<00:00:18.480> tunnel<00:00:19.010> now<00:00:20.010> the<00:00:20.070> reason<00:00:20.400> for

00:00:20.689 --> 00:00:20.699 
through this tunnel now the reason for

00:00:20.699 --> 00:00:22.400 
through this tunnel now the reason for
using<00:00:20.820> content<00:00:21.270> creator<00:00:21.570> here<00:00:21.750> is<00:00:22.020> unlike

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:22.410 
using content creator here is unlike

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:23.750 
using content creator here is unlike
story<00:00:22.740> mode<00:00:22.980> you<00:00:23.100> won't<00:00:23.250> have<00:00:23.340> to<00:00:23.490> wait<00:00:23.640> about

00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:23.760 
story mode you won't have to wait about

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:26.029 
story mode you won't have to wait about
a<00:00:23.910> minute<00:00:23.939> for<00:00:24.359> a<00:00:24.390> respawn<00:00:24.869> so<00:00:25.680> it's<00:00:25.830> a<00:00:25.890> lot

00:00:26.029 --> 00:00:26.039 
a minute for a respawn so it's a lot

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:27.710 
a minute for a respawn so it's a lot
quicker<00:00:26.279> you<00:00:26.789> know<00:00:26.849> you<00:00:27.060> can<00:00:27.180> do<00:00:27.300> a<00:00:27.330> lot<00:00:27.570> better

00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:27.720 
quicker you know you can do a lot better

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:30.650 
quicker you know you can do a lot better
stunts<00:00:28.080> this<00:00:28.289> way<00:00:28.580> so<00:00:29.580> I<00:00:29.609> like<00:00:29.939> to<00:00:30.090> place<00:00:30.359> my

00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:30.660 
stunts this way so I like to place my

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:34.220 
stunts this way so I like to place my
trigger<00:00:31.590> quite<00:00:31.890> far<00:00:32.130> behind<00:00:32.600> the<00:00:33.600> actual<00:00:33.989> spot

00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:34.230 
trigger quite far behind the actual spot

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:35.900 
trigger quite far behind the actual spot
along<00:00:34.559> with<00:00:34.710> my<00:00:34.860> checkpoint<00:00:35.370> and<00:00:35.520> I<00:00:35.610> like<00:00:35.760> to

00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:35.910 
along with my checkpoint and I like to

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:38.119 
along with my checkpoint and I like to
place<00:00:36.239> a<00:00:36.270> checkpoint<00:00:36.719> quite<00:00:36.989> high<00:00:37.170> as<00:00:37.380> you

00:00:38.119 --> 00:00:38.129 
place a checkpoint quite high as you

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:41.060 
place a checkpoint quite high as you
notice<00:00:38.430> idea<00:00:38.640> about<00:00:38.879> 400<00:00:39.420> for<00:00:39.629> the<00:00:40.530> reason<00:00:40.860> for

00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:41.070 
notice idea about 400 for the reason for

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:43.010 
notice idea about 400 for the reason for
this<00:00:41.190> is<00:00:41.460> that<00:00:41.520> sometimes<00:00:42.420> the<00:00:42.570> spawns<00:00:42.870> are

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:43.020 
this is that sometimes the spawns are

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:46.190 
this is that sometimes the spawns are
delayed<00:00:43.430> so<00:00:44.430> although<00:00:44.969> your<00:00:45.450> plane<00:00:45.660> has<00:00:45.899> done

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:46.200 
delayed so although your plane has done

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:48.319 
delayed so although your plane has done
has<00:00:46.440> spawned<00:00:46.920> you<00:00:47.219> won't<00:00:47.579> see<00:00:47.820> until<00:00:48.090> it's

00:00:48.319 --> 00:00:48.329 
has spawned you won't see until it's

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:50.270 
has spawned you won't see until it's
already<00:00:48.629> crashed<00:00:48.870> into<00:00:49.050> the<00:00:49.200> ground<00:00:49.440> so<00:00:50.100> this

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:50.280 
already crashed into the ground so this

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:51.650 
already crashed into the ground so this
way<00:00:50.430> if<00:00:50.520> you<00:00:50.579> do<00:00:50.730> spawn<00:00:51.030> and<00:00:51.239> it<00:00:51.329> does<00:00:51.510> get

00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:51.660 
way if you do spawn and it does get

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:53.720 
way if you do spawn and it does get
delayed<00:00:51.989> you<00:00:52.710> can<00:00:52.890> easily<00:00:53.070> recover<00:00:53.550> and

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:53.730 
delayed you can easily recover and

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:56.330 
delayed you can easily recover and
continue<00:00:54.120> your<00:00:54.149> stunt<00:00:54.570> as<00:00:54.829> for<00:00:55.829> the<00:00:55.860> second

00:00:56.330 --> 00:00:56.340 
continue your stunt as for the second

00:00:56.340 --> 00:00:57.709 
continue your stunt as for the second
checkpoint<00:00:56.460> I<00:00:56.789> like<00:00:56.940> to<00:00:57.059> place<00:00:57.239> it<00:00:57.420> behind<00:00:57.539> a

00:00:57.709 --> 00:00:57.719 
checkpoint I like to place it behind a

00:00:57.719 --> 00:01:00.920 
checkpoint I like to place it behind a
high<00:00:57.840> object<00:00:58.260> and<00:00:58.440> that<00:00:58.760> way<00:00:59.760> no<00:01:00.270> one<00:01:00.300> can<00:01:00.480> see

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:00.930 
high object and that way no one can see

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:03.799 
high object and that way no one can see
and<00:01:01.340> it<00:01:02.340> makes<00:01:02.579> if<00:01:02.850> you<00:01:02.940> use<00:01:03.120> in<00:01:03.270> a<00:01:03.359> montage<00:01:03.690> he

00:01:03.799 --> 00:01:03.809 
and it makes if you use in a montage he

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:06.560 
and it makes if you use in a montage he
looks<00:01:03.989> a<00:01:04.080> lot<00:01:04.170> cleaner<00:01:04.939> so<00:01:05.939> there's<00:01:06.240> not<00:01:06.330> a<00:01:06.390> lot

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:06.570 
looks a lot cleaner so there's not a lot

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:08.450 
looks a lot cleaner so there's not a lot
to<00:01:06.600> say<00:01:06.810> there's<00:01:07.020> only<00:01:07.110> a<00:01:07.290> few<00:01:07.500> pointers<00:01:08.159> often

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:08.460 
to say there's only a few pointers often

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:11.359 
to say there's only a few pointers often
give<00:01:08.640> to<00:01:08.850> you<00:01:08.909> I<00:01:09.119> was<00:01:10.110> trying<00:01:10.350> to<00:01:10.409> show<00:01:10.710> that<00:01:10.740> if

00:01:11.359 --> 00:01:11.369 
give to you I was trying to show that if

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:14.600 
give to you I was trying to show that if
you<00:01:11.880> crush<00:01:12.180> your<00:01:12.420> plane<00:01:13.340> he'll<00:01:14.340> spawn

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:14.610 
you crush your plane he'll spawn

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:16.370 
you crush your plane he'll spawn
instantly<00:01:15.210> however<00:01:15.780> if<00:01:16.020> you<00:01:16.110> hold<00:01:16.290> down

00:01:16.370 --> 00:01:16.380 
instantly however if you hold down

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:18.080 
instantly however if you hold down
triangle<00:01:16.710> it's<00:01:17.130> delayed<00:01:17.490> although<00:01:17.820> I<00:01:17.850> never

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:18.090 
triangle it's delayed although I never

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:21.440 
triangle it's delayed although I never
wear<00:01:18.360> but<00:01:19.110> generally<00:01:19.530> that<00:01:19.710> is<00:01:19.799> why<00:01:19.950> fine<00:01:20.450> so

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:21.450 
wear but generally that is why fine so

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:23.780 
wear but generally that is why fine so
the<00:01:21.810> first<00:01:22.049> then<00:01:22.530> probably<00:01:22.950> the<00:01:23.159> main<00:01:23.369> tip<00:01:23.640> i'm

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:23.790 
the first then probably the main tip i'm

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:27.170 
the first then probably the main tip i'm
going<00:01:24.000> to<00:01:24.180> show<00:01:24.540> you<00:01:24.799> is<00:01:25.799> how<00:01:25.860> to<00:01:26.250> fly<00:01:26.610> inverted

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:27.180 
going to show you is how to fly inverted

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:29.090 
going to show you is how to fly inverted
now<00:01:27.479> a<00:01:27.509> lot<00:01:27.840> of<00:01:27.869> people<00:01:27.990> who<00:01:28.619> wait<00:01:28.799> till<00:01:28.979> the

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:29.100 
now a lot of people who wait till the

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:31.050 
now a lot of people who wait till the
plane<00:01:29.220> drops<00:01:29.579> down<00:01:29.790> to<00:01:29.850> the<00:01:30.030> ground

00:01:31.050 --> 00:01:31.060 
plane drops down to the ground

00:01:31.060 --> 00:01:34.170 
plane drops down to the ground
like<00:01:31.810> so<00:01:32.229> and<00:01:32.500> then<00:01:32.530> press<00:01:32.829> up<00:01:33.009> and<00:01:33.189> it<00:01:33.850> doesn't

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:34.180 
like so and then press up and it doesn't

00:01:34.180 --> 00:01:35.670 
like so and then press up and it doesn't
look<00:01:34.210> clean<00:01:34.420> your<00:01:34.780> plane<00:01:34.990> kind<00:01:35.229> of<00:01:35.320> Bob's<00:01:35.500> up

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:35.680 
look clean your plane kind of Bob's up

00:01:35.680 --> 00:01:37.920 
look clean your plane kind of Bob's up
four<00:01:35.829> Non<00:01:35.920> constantly<00:01:36.490> and<00:01:36.820> I<00:01:37.750> would

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:37.930 
four Non constantly and I would

00:01:37.930 --> 00:01:40.620 
four Non constantly and I would
recommend<00:01:38.140> that<00:01:38.530> makes<00:01:39.460> it<00:01:39.640> harder<00:01:40.180> even<00:01:40.299> as

00:01:40.620 --> 00:01:40.630 
recommend that makes it harder even as

00:01:40.630 --> 00:01:42.090 
recommend that makes it harder even as
well<00:01:40.780> because<00:01:41.079> you're<00:01:41.229> kind<00:01:41.350> of<00:01:41.500> panicking<00:01:41.920> at

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:42.100 
well because you're kind of panicking at

00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:44.700 
well because you're kind of panicking at
suddenly<00:01:42.460> Prescott<00:01:42.930> what<00:01:43.930> I<00:01:43.960> found<00:01:44.259> works<00:01:44.530> a

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:44.710 
suddenly Prescott what I found works a

00:01:44.710 --> 00:01:48.210 
suddenly Prescott what I found works a
lot<00:01:44.799> better<00:01:44.860> is<00:01:45.340> to<00:01:45.399> constantly<00:01:45.970> tap<00:01:47.220> cancel

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:48.220 
lot better is to constantly tap cancel

00:01:48.220 --> 00:01:51.230 
lot better is to constantly tap cancel
constantly<00:01:48.970> talk<00:01:49.179> up<00:01:49.390> on<00:01:49.600> the<00:01:49.840> analog<00:01:50.770> stick

00:01:51.230 --> 00:01:51.240 
constantly talk up on the analog stick

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:53.969 
constantly talk up on the analog stick
so<00:01:52.240> only<00:01:52.630> slightly<00:01:52.990> and<00:01:53.350> you<00:01:53.380> have<00:01:53.590> to<00:01:53.710> get<00:01:53.829> the

00:01:53.969 --> 00:01:53.979 
so only slightly and you have to get the

00:01:53.979 --> 00:01:55.410 
so only slightly and you have to get the
FK<00:01:54.100> used<00:01:54.429> to<00:01:54.549> the<00:01:54.640> time<00:01:54.789> you<00:01:54.850> have<00:01:55.090> to<00:01:55.270> figure

00:01:55.410 --> 00:01:55.420 
FK used to the time you have to figure

00:01:55.420 --> 00:01:57.510 
FK used to the time you have to figure
out<00:01:55.570> but<00:01:56.380> he<00:01:56.470> kind<00:01:56.710> of<00:01:56.829> looks<00:01:57.009> like<00:01:57.070> the<00:01:57.310> plane

00:01:57.510 --> 00:01:57.520 
out but he kind of looks like the plane

00:01:57.520 --> 00:01:59.760 
out but he kind of looks like the plane
is<00:01:57.759> just<00:01:58.030> easily<00:01:58.929> flying<00:01:59.229> in<00:01:59.380> a<00:01:59.470> straight<00:01:59.530> line

00:01:59.760 --> 00:01:59.770 
is just easily flying in a straight line

00:01:59.770 --> 00:02:01.590 
is just easily flying in a straight line
inverted<00:02:00.610> and<00:02:00.729> it's<00:02:00.850> not<00:02:00.970> dropping<00:02:01.210> towards

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:01.600 
inverted and it's not dropping towards

00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:02.440 
inverted and it's not dropping towards

00:02:02.440 --> 00:02:02.450

so<00:02:03.170> as<00:02:03.530> you<00:02:03.770> can<00:02:03.890> see<00:02:04.130> here<00:02:04.579> once<00:02:05.360> I<00:02:05.509> recovered

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:06.430 
so as you can see here once I recovered

00:02:06.430 --> 00:02:09.940 
so as you can see here once I recovered
that's<00:02:07.430> why<00:02:07.640> I<00:02:07.670> decided<00:02:07.880> to<00:02:08.209> do<00:02:08.679> so<00:02:09.679> in<00:02:09.920> the

00:02:09.940 --> 00:02:09.950 
that's why I decided to do so in the

00:02:09.950 --> 00:02:11.380 
that's why I decided to do so in the
background<00:02:10.399> now<00:02:10.550> you<00:02:10.729> will<00:02:10.910> see<00:02:10.940> me

00:02:11.380 --> 00:02:11.390 
background now you will see me

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:13.600 
background now you will see me
constantly<00:02:12.379> doing<00:02:12.560> the<00:02:12.709> tunnel<00:02:13.069> using<00:02:13.280> duct

00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:13.610 
constantly doing the tunnel using duct

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:15.940 
constantly doing the tunnel using duct
tape<00:02:13.640> other<00:02:14.599> than<00:02:14.810> that<00:02:14.870> I<00:02:15.050> would<00:02:15.260> say<00:02:15.530> try<00:02:15.860> not

00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:15.950 
tape other than that I would say try not

00:02:15.950 --> 00:02:19.750 
tape other than that I would say try not
to<00:02:16.129> hold<00:02:16.310> down<00:02:16.580> our<00:02:16.819> to<00:02:17.030> too<00:02:17.239> much<00:02:17.450> as<00:02:18.489> it<00:02:19.489> just

00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:19.760 
to hold down our to too much as it just

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:21.009 
to hold down our to too much as it just
speeds<00:02:19.970> up<00:02:20.150> your<00:02:20.180> plane<00:02:20.480> and<00:02:20.599> it<00:02:20.720> makes<00:02:20.870> it

00:02:21.009 --> 00:02:21.019 
speeds up your plane and it makes it

00:02:21.019 --> 00:02:23.229 
speeds up your plane and it makes it
more<00:02:21.200> difficult<00:02:21.380> to<00:02:21.769> make<00:02:22.010> the<00:02:22.160> tail<00:02:22.370> so

00:02:23.229 --> 00:02:23.239 
more difficult to make the tail so

00:02:23.239 --> 00:02:25.960 
more difficult to make the tail so
generally<00:02:23.780> tap<00:02:24.050> up<00:02:24.349> and<00:02:24.680> try<00:02:25.370> not<00:02:25.519> to<00:02:25.640> hold<00:02:25.730> or

00:02:25.960 --> 00:02:25.970 
generally tap up and try not to hold or

00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:28.240 
generally tap up and try not to hold or
two<00:02:26.150> unless<00:02:26.300> you<00:02:26.569> need<00:02:26.720> it<00:02:26.900> so<00:02:27.739> for<00:02:27.920> example<00:02:27.980> if

00:02:28.240 --> 00:02:28.250 
two unless you need it so for example if

00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:29.470 
two unless you need it so for example if
you're<00:02:28.370> trying<00:02:28.459> to<00:02:28.549> do<00:02:28.700> a<00:02:28.730> role<00:02:28.970> in<00:02:29.150> a<00:02:29.239> tunnel

00:02:29.470 --> 00:02:29.480 
you're trying to do a role in a tunnel

00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:31.059 
you're trying to do a role in a tunnel
you<00:02:29.690> will<00:02:29.870> need<00:02:30.019> are<00:02:30.200> two<00:02:30.230> but<00:02:30.620> generally<00:02:31.040> I

00:02:31.059 --> 00:02:31.069 
you will need are two but generally I

00:02:31.069 --> 00:02:34.690 
you will need are two but generally I
would<00:02:31.130> be<00:02:31.340> easy<00:02:31.580> and<00:02:31.910> I<00:02:32.840> aim<00:02:33.170> to<00:02:33.200> use<00:02:33.560> R<00:02:33.920> 1<00:02:34.160> and<00:02:34.370> N

00:02:34.690 --> 00:02:34.700 
would be easy and I aim to use R 1 and N

00:02:34.700 --> 00:02:37.539 
would be easy and I aim to use R 1 and N
1<00:02:35.170> i'm<00:02:36.170> not<00:02:36.349> sure<00:02:36.500> what<00:02:36.590> that<00:02:36.650> is<00:02:36.830> on<00:02:37.010> the<00:02:37.130> xbox

00:02:37.539 --> 00:02:37.549 
1 i'm not sure what that is on the xbox

00:02:37.549 --> 00:02:39.670 
1 i'm not sure what that is on the xbox
but<00:02:38.000> that's<00:02:38.299> why<00:02:38.450> i<00:02:38.480> use<00:02:38.720> to<00:02:38.989> turn<00:02:39.319> that<00:02:39.500> the

00:02:39.670 --> 00:02:39.680 
but that's why i use to turn that the

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:43.000 
but that's why i use to turn that the
night<00:02:39.860> here<00:02:40.130> colonel<00:02:41.440> other<00:02:42.440> than<00:02:42.620> now<00:02:42.799> also

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:43.010 
night here colonel other than now also

00:02:43.010 --> 00:02:44.589 
night here colonel other than now also
wanted<00:02:43.370> to<00:02:43.400> cover<00:02:43.640> night<00:02:43.940> flights<00:02:44.239> as<00:02:44.540> I

00:02:44.589 --> 00:02:44.599 
wanted to cover night flights as I

00:02:44.599 --> 00:02:48.729 
wanted to cover night flights as I
recently<00:02:45.280> learned<00:02:46.280> how<00:02:46.579> to<00:02:47.170> do<00:02:48.170> night<00:02:48.470> flights

00:02:48.729 --> 00:02:48.739 
recently learned how to do night flights

00:02:48.739 --> 00:02:50.860 
recently learned how to do night flights
not<00:02:48.950> there<00:02:49.190> now<00:02:49.910> because<00:02:50.299> when<00:02:50.450> you<00:02:50.569> diverse

00:02:50.860 --> 00:02:50.870 
not there now because when you diverse

00:02:50.870 --> 00:02:53.350 
not there now because when you diverse
to<00:02:51.019> a<00:02:51.079> life<00:02:51.290> like<00:02:51.530> the<00:02:51.680> plane<00:02:51.920> drops<00:02:52.250> I<00:02:52.579> found

00:02:53.350 --> 00:02:53.360 
to a life like the plane drops I found

00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:55.000 
to a life like the plane drops I found
its<00:02:53.569> best<00:02:53.840> to<00:02:54.110> move<00:02:54.319> in<00:02:54.530> an<00:02:54.650> upward<00:02:54.829> direction

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:55.010 
its best to move in an upward direction

00:02:55.010 --> 00:02:58.660 
its best to move in an upward direction
first<00:02:55.819> as<00:02:56.120> you'll<00:02:56.930> see<00:02:56.989> now<00:02:57.410> and<00:02:57.680> then<00:02:58.400> do<00:02:58.549> an

00:02:58.660 --> 00:02:58.670 
first as you'll see now and then do an

00:02:58.670 --> 00:03:00.490 
first as you'll see now and then do an
eye<00:02:58.790> flight<00:02:59.090> that<00:02:59.329> way<00:02:59.480> when<00:02:59.870> the<00:02:59.959> plane<00:03:00.170> drops

00:03:00.490 --> 00:03:00.500 
eye flight that way when the plane drops

00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:03.190 
eye flight that way when the plane drops
it<00:03:01.400> won't<00:03:01.670> be<00:03:01.790> as<00:03:01.910> much<00:03:02.120> anymore<00:03:02.360> roomiest<00:03:02.989> and

00:03:03.190 --> 00:03:03.200 
it won't be as much anymore roomiest and

00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:04.300 
it won't be as much anymore roomiest and
so<00:03:03.319> you<00:03:03.380> can<00:03:03.470> kind<00:03:03.680> of<00:03:03.739> go<00:03:03.890> in<00:03:03.950> a<00:03:04.040> straight<00:03:04.190> line

00:03:04.300 --> 00:03:04.310 
so you can kind of go in a straight line

00:03:04.310 --> 00:03:07.000 
so you can kind of go in a straight line
as<00:03:04.670> its<00:03:04.819> dropping<00:03:05.000> so<00:03:05.870> as<00:03:05.959> you<00:03:06.019> see<00:03:06.200> I<00:03:06.230> move<00:03:06.799> off

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:07.010 
as its dropping so as you see I move off

00:03:07.010 --> 00:03:09.280 
as its dropping so as you see I move off
before<00:03:07.370> I<00:03:07.400> actually<00:03:07.549> do<00:03:07.880> the<00:03:08.030> night<00:03:08.180> flight<00:03:08.480> so

00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:09.290 
before I actually do the night flight so

00:03:09.290 --> 00:03:10.599 
before I actually do the night flight so
that's<00:03:09.470> pretty<00:03:09.650> much<00:03:09.739> all<00:03:10.010> there<00:03:10.190> is<00:03:10.250> to<00:03:10.519> it

00:03:10.599 --> 00:03:10.609 
that's pretty much all there is to it

00:03:10.609 --> 00:03:13.569 
that's pretty much all there is to it
landside<00:03:11.299> practice<00:03:11.889> so<00:03:12.889> I<00:03:12.920> hope<00:03:13.130> you<00:03:13.340> enjoyed

00:03:13.569 --> 00:03:13.579 
landside practice so I hope you enjoyed
