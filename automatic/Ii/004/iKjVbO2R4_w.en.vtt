with an umbrella on the top of that

00:01:16.150 --> 00:01:17.789 
with an umbrella on the top of that
shaft<00:01:16.570> and<00:01:16.780> then<00:01:16.930> hanging<00:01:17.140> from<00:01:17.380> the<00:01:17.500> outside

00:01:17.789 --> 00:01:17.799 
shaft and then hanging from the outside

00:01:17.799 --> 00:01:19.410 
shaft and then hanging from the outside
edge<00:01:18.010> of<00:01:18.190> that<00:01:18.280> umbrella<00:01:18.700> would<00:01:19.210> have<00:01:19.299> been<00:01:19.390> a

00:01:19.410 --> 00:01:19.420 
edge of that umbrella would have been a

00:01:19.420 --> 00:01:22.050 
edge of that umbrella would have been a
series<00:01:19.810> of<00:01:19.840> bangles<00:01:20.530> also<00:01:21.490> on<00:01:21.610> the<00:01:21.729> front<00:01:21.970> if
