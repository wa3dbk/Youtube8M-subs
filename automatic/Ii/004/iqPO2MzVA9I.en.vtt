00:02:51.609 --> 00:02:53.849 
to the tip your finger which is the most
sensitive<00:02:52.030> part<00:02:52.299> of<00:02:52.390> your<00:02:52.480> hand<00:02:52.690> by<00:02:53.470> combining

00:02:53.849 --> 00:02:53.859 
sensitive part of your hand by combining

00:02:53.859 --> 00:02:55.559 
sensitive part of your hand by combining
these<00:02:54.160> two<00:02:54.220> extra<00:02:54.700> motors<00:02:55.000> with<00:02:55.209> the<00:02:55.359> current

00:02:55.559 --> 00:02:55.569 
these two extra motors with the current

00:02:55.569 --> 00:02:57.479 
these two extra motors with the current
Rumble<00:02:55.989> motors<00:02:56.109> that<00:02:56.500> we<00:02:56.620> had<00:02:56.799> in<00:02:57.069> the

00:02:57.479 --> 00:02:57.489 
Rumble motors that we had in the

00:02:57.489 --> 00:02:59.250 
Rumble motors that we had in the
previous<00:02:57.640> generation<00:02:57.849> we<00:02:58.569> can<00:02:58.690> now<00:02:58.780> create

00:02:59.250 --> 00:02:59.260 
previous generation we can now create

00:02:59.260 --> 00:03:00.960 
previous generation we can now create
richer<00:02:59.859> haptic<00:03:00.430> effects<00:03:00.790> that<00:03:00.910> have

00:03:00.960 --> 00:03:00.970 
richer haptic effects that have

00:03:00.970 --> 00:03:02.849 
richer haptic effects that have
directionality<00:03:01.629> to<00:03:02.019> them<00:03:02.230> so<00:03:02.709> you<00:03:02.769> can

00:03:02.849 --> 00:03:02.859 
directionality to them so you can

00:03:02.859 --> 00:03:04.559 
directionality to them so you can
communicate<00:03:03.099> forward<00:03:03.670> back<00:03:03.819> left<00:03:04.090> right

00:03:04.559 --> 00:03:04.569 
communicate forward back left right

00:03:04.569 --> 00:03:06.630 
communicate forward back left right
really<00:03:05.140> subtle<00:03:05.650> effect<00:03:05.950> could<00:03:06.129> be<00:03:06.190> that<00:03:06.489> when

00:03:06.630 --> 00:03:06.640 
really subtle effect could be that when

00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:07.920 
really subtle effect could be that when
you<00:03:06.760> run<00:03:06.910> out<00:03:06.940> of<00:03:07.090> bullets<00:03:07.209> you<00:03:07.480> feel<00:03:07.720> the

00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:07.930 
you run out of bullets you feel the

00:03:07.930 --> 00:03:10.199 
you run out of bullets you feel the
empty<00:03:08.799> chamber<00:03:09.220> right<00:03:09.670> so<00:03:09.940> you<00:03:10.000> know

00:03:10.199 --> 00:03:10.209 
empty chamber right so you know

00:03:10.209 --> 00:03:11.339 
empty chamber right so you know
immediately<00:03:10.540> that<00:03:11.019> you've<00:03:11.109> run<00:03:11.230> out<00:03:11.290> of

00:03:11.339 --> 00:03:11.349 
immediately that you've run out of

00:03:11.349 --> 00:03:12.660 
immediately that you've run out of
bullets<00:03:11.500> and<00:03:11.890> the<00:03:12.040> next<00:03:12.190> thing<00:03:12.280> you<00:03:12.370> got<00:03:12.489> to<00:03:12.519> do

00:03:12.660 --> 00:03:12.670 
bullets and the next thing you got to do

00:03:12.670 --> 00:03:14.670 
bullets and the next thing you got to do
is<00:03:12.790> reload<00:03:13.120> so<00:03:13.810> another<00:03:14.019> big<00:03:14.200> one<00:03:14.319> is<00:03:14.500> the

00:03:14.670 --> 00:03:14.680 
is reload so another big one is the

00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:16.410 
is reload so another big one is the
magnetic<00:03:15.069> trigger<00:03:15.430> sensor<00:03:15.819> we've<00:03:16.209> eliminated

00:03:16.410 --> 00:03:16.420 
magnetic trigger sensor we've eliminated

00:03:16.420 --> 00:03:18.599 
magnetic trigger sensor we've eliminated
all<00:03:16.930> the<00:03:17.049> mechanical<00:03:17.650> parts<00:03:17.680> that<00:03:18.130> used<00:03:18.340> to<00:03:18.489> be

00:03:18.599 --> 00:03:18.609 
all the mechanical parts that used to be

00:03:18.609 --> 00:03:20.309 
all the mechanical parts that used to be
in<00:03:18.639> the<00:03:18.910> old<00:03:19.090> controller<00:03:19.510> and<00:03:19.780> replaced<00:03:20.200> it

00:03:20.309 --> 00:03:20.319 
in the old controller and replaced it

00:03:20.319 --> 00:03:22.349 
in the old controller and replaced it
with<00:03:20.380> a<00:03:20.500> mechanical<00:03:20.680> digital<00:03:21.519> sensor<00:03:22.090> so<00:03:22.329> it

00:03:22.349 --> 00:03:22.359 
with a mechanical digital sensor so it

00:03:22.359 --> 00:03:24.569 
with a mechanical digital sensor so it
means<00:03:22.900> that<00:03:23.109> it's<00:03:23.260> twice<00:03:23.680> as<00:03:23.709> sensitive<00:03:24.069> as<00:03:24.430> it

00:03:24.569 --> 00:03:24.579 
means that it's twice as sensitive as it

00:03:24.579 --> 00:03:26.339 
means that it's twice as sensitive as it
ever<00:03:24.639> was<00:03:24.849> before<00:03:24.910> so<00:03:25.630> in<00:03:25.750> fort<00:03:26.079> so<00:03:26.169> when

00:03:26.339 --> 00:03:26.349 
ever was before so in fort so when

00:03:26.349 --> 00:03:27.509 
ever was before so in fort so when
you're<00:03:26.470> trying<00:03:26.560> to<00:03:26.650> feather<00:03:26.859> the<00:03:27.040> gas<00:03:27.069> you'll

00:03:27.509 --> 00:03:27.519 
you're trying to feather the gas you'll

00:03:27.519 --> 00:03:29.400 
you're trying to feather the gas you'll
have<00:03:27.669> that<00:03:27.880> much<00:03:27.940> more<00:03:28.150> control<00:03:28.720> over<00:03:28.959> that

00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:29.410 
have that much more control over that

00:03:29.410 --> 00:03:31.319 
have that much more control over that
gas<00:03:29.650> pedal<00:03:30.040> and<00:03:30.190> let's<00:03:30.519> talk<00:03:30.669> about<00:03:30.790> this<00:03:30.970> D

00:03:31.319 --> 00:03:31.329 
gas pedal and let's talk about this D

00:03:31.329 --> 00:03:32.280 
gas pedal and let's talk about this D
pod<00:03:31.540> as<00:03:31.690> well<00:03:31.840> because<00:03:31.989> it's<00:03:32.109> pretty

00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:32.290 
pod as well because it's pretty

00:03:32.290 --> 00:03:34.349 
pod as well because it's pretty
significant<00:03:32.739> changes<00:03:33.099> here<00:03:33.400> right<00:03:33.639> the<00:03:34.000> pivot

00:03:34.349 --> 00:03:34.359 
significant changes here right the pivot

00:03:34.359 --> 00:03:35.909 
significant changes here right the pivot
point<00:03:34.599> for<00:03:34.780> the<00:03:34.870> d-pad<00:03:35.169> itself<00:03:35.440> had<00:03:35.620> to<00:03:35.709> be<00:03:35.799> as

00:03:35.909 --> 00:03:35.919 
point for the d-pad itself had to be as

00:03:35.919 --> 00:03:37.860 
point for the d-pad itself had to be as
high<00:03:36.160> as<00:03:36.190> possible<00:03:36.430> by<00:03:37.150> moving<00:03:37.389> that<00:03:37.480> pivot

00:03:37.860 --> 00:03:37.870 
high as possible by moving that pivot

00:03:37.870 --> 00:03:40.379 
high as possible by moving that pivot
point<00:03:38.049> up<00:03:38.169> we<00:03:38.349> get<00:03:38.500> really<00:03:38.700> nimble<00:03:39.700> action

00:03:40.379 --> 00:03:40.389 
point up we get really nimble action

00:03:40.389 --> 00:03:42.750 
point up we get really nimble action
we've<00:03:41.139> combined<00:03:41.530> that<00:03:41.709> nimble<00:03:42.040> action<00:03:42.310> with<00:03:42.519> a

00:03:42.750 --> 00:03:42.760 
we've combined that nimble action with a

00:03:42.760 --> 00:03:45.120 
we've combined that nimble action with a
new<00:03:43.030> type<00:03:43.239> of<00:03:43.269> switch<00:03:43.690> under<00:03:44.650> the<00:03:44.829> d-pad

00:03:45.120 --> 00:03:45.130 
new type of switch under the d-pad

00:03:45.130 --> 00:03:47.670 
new type of switch under the d-pad
itself<00:03:45.489> it's<00:03:45.760> got<00:03:45.970> really<00:03:46.359> crisp<00:03:46.690> feedback<00:03:47.349> so

00:03:47.670 --> 00:03:47.680 
itself it's got really crisp feedback so

00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:49.259 
itself it's got really crisp feedback so
you<00:03:47.919> know<00:03:48.010> immediately<00:03:48.340> once<00:03:48.849> you've<00:03:49.030> pressed

00:03:49.259 --> 00:03:49.269 
you know immediately once you've pressed

00:03:49.269 --> 00:03:50.550 
you know immediately once you've pressed
it<00:03:49.540> alright<00:03:49.930> let's<00:03:50.079> talk<00:03:50.230> about<00:03:50.349> the

00:03:50.550 --> 00:03:50.560 
it alright let's talk about the

00:03:50.560 --> 00:03:52.170 
it alright let's talk about the
thumbsticks<00:03:51.130> as<00:03:51.340> well<00:03:51.459> write<00:03:51.639> something<00:03:52.030> that

00:03:52.170 --> 00:03:52.180 
thumbsticks as well write something that

00:03:52.180 --> 00:03:53.009 
thumbsticks as well write something that
when<00:03:52.269> you're<00:03:52.389> playing<00:03:52.569> games<00:03:52.870> you're

00:03:53.009 --> 00:03:53.019 
when you're playing games you're

00:03:53.019 --> 00:03:54.599 
when you're playing games you're
connected<00:03:53.620> to<00:03:53.769> the<00:03:53.919> whole<00:03:54.069> time<00:03:54.310> the

00:03:54.599 --> 00:03:54.609 
connected to the whole time the

00:03:54.609 --> 00:03:55.860 
connected to the whole time the
thumbsticks<00:03:55.120> we<00:03:55.239> made<00:03:55.389> them<00:03:55.540> slightly

00:03:55.860 --> 00:03:55.870 
thumbsticks we made them slightly

00:03:55.870 --> 00:03:57.479 
thumbsticks we made them slightly
smaller<00:03:56.290> in<00:03:56.440> diameter<00:03:56.590> I'm<00:03:57.099> making<00:03:57.400> them

00:03:57.479 --> 00:03:57.489 
smaller in diameter I'm making them

00:03:57.489 --> 00:03:59.250 
smaller in diameter I'm making them
smaller<00:03:57.609> your<00:03:57.970> thumbs<00:03:58.239> closer<00:03:58.599> to<00:03:58.810> the<00:03:58.930> center

00:03:59.250 --> 00:03:59.260 
smaller your thumbs closer to the center

00:03:59.260 --> 00:04:01.259 
smaller your thumbs closer to the center
we've<00:03:59.560> maintained<00:04:00.069> the<00:04:00.310> the<00:04:00.669> ridge<00:04:00.849> that<00:04:01.150> was

00:04:01.259 --> 00:04:01.269 
we've maintained the the ridge that was

00:04:01.269 --> 00:04:03.720 
we've maintained the the ridge that was
so<00:04:01.450> characteristic<00:04:02.049> of<00:04:02.169> the<00:04:02.379> xbox<00:04:02.980> 360

00:04:03.720 --> 00:04:03.730 
so characteristic of the xbox 360

00:04:03.730 --> 00:04:05.729 
so characteristic of the xbox 360
controller<00:04:03.940> which<00:04:04.780> is<00:04:04.930> a<00:04:04.959> great<00:04:05.290> feature<00:04:05.560> for

00:04:05.729 --> 00:04:05.739 
controller which is a great feature for

00:04:05.739 --> 00:04:08.670 
controller which is a great feature for
for<00:04:06.430> pulling<00:04:06.730> back<00:04:06.910> and<00:04:07.180> added<00:04:08.019> texture<00:04:08.410> to

00:04:08.670 --> 00:04:08.680 
for pulling back and added texture to

00:04:08.680 --> 00:04:09.930 
for pulling back and added texture to
the<00:04:08.769> outside<00:04:09.069> so<00:04:09.250> that<00:04:09.280> when<00:04:09.579> you're<00:04:09.699> pushing

00:04:09.930 --> 00:04:09.940 
the outside so that when you're pushing

00:04:09.940 --> 00:04:12.420 
the outside so that when you're pushing
you<00:04:10.180> can<00:04:10.389> get<00:04:10.540> really<00:04:10.840> good<00:04:11.019> grip<00:04:11.590> so<00:04:12.099> the

00:04:12.420 --> 00:04:12.430 
you can get really good grip so the

00:04:12.430 --> 00:04:13.920 
you can get really good grip so the
other<00:04:12.609> improvement<00:04:13.150> that<00:04:13.269> we<00:04:13.389> made<00:04:13.599> was<00:04:13.810> we

00:04:13.920 --> 00:04:13.930 
other improvement that we made was we

00:04:13.930 --> 00:04:15.509 
other improvement that we made was we
were<00:04:14.019> able<00:04:14.139> to<00:04:14.349> dramatically<00:04:15.040> reduce<00:04:15.280> the

00:04:15.509 --> 00:04:15.519 
were able to dramatically reduce the

00:04:15.519 --> 00:04:17.699 
were able to dramatically reduce the
dead<00:04:15.879> zone<00:04:15.910> in<00:04:16.299> the<00:04:16.599> stick<00:04:16.900> itself<00:04:17.199> by

00:04:17.699 --> 00:04:17.709 
dead zone in the stick itself by

00:04:17.709 --> 00:04:19.229 
dead zone in the stick itself by
reducing<00:04:18.039> the<00:04:18.160> dead<00:04:18.459> zone<00:04:18.489> with<00:04:18.849> increased

00:04:19.229 --> 00:04:19.239

00:04:28.320 --> 00:04:28.330 
worried then this is going to be

00:04:28.330 --> 00:04:29.670 
worried then this is going to be
slightly<00:04:28.570> different<00:04:28.780> we've<00:04:29.230> been<00:04:29.380> working<00:04:29.530> on

00:04:29.670 --> 00:04:29.680 
slightly different we've been working on

slightly different we've been working on
this<00:04:29.770> for<00:04:29.830> two<00:04:30.100> years<00:04:30.130> and<00:04:30.610> our<00:04:30.850> main<00:04:31.270> goal<00:04:31.540> was

00:04:31.800 --> 00:04:31.810 
this for two years and our main goal was

00:04:31.810 --> 00:04:33.840 
this for two years and our main goal was
to<00:04:32.050> make<00:04:32.080> sure<00:04:32.440> that<00:04:32.650> the<00:04:32.980> xbox<00:04:33.610> one

00:04:33.840 --> 00:04:33.850 
to make sure that the xbox one

00:04:33.850 --> 00:04:35.790 
to make sure that the xbox one
controller<00:04:34.270> was<00:04:34.480> familiar<00:04:34.900> and<00:04:35.110> we<00:04:35.620> talked

00:04:35.790 --> 00:04:35.800 
controller was familiar and we talked

00:04:35.800 --> 00:04:37.470 
controller was familiar and we talked
about<00:04:35.950> the<00:04:36.190> 40<00:04:36.490> improvements<00:04:37.030> and<00:04:37.180> most<00:04:37.330> of

00:04:37.470 --> 00:04:37.480 
about the 40 improvements and most of

00:04:37.480 --> 00:04:39.930 
about the 40 improvements and most of
those<00:04:37.600> are<00:04:37.660> fairly<00:04:38.620> small<00:04:38.980> things<00:04:39.310> when<00:04:39.850> you

00:04:39.930 --> 00:04:39.940 
those are fairly small things when you

00:04:39.940 --> 00:04:41.310 
those are fairly small things when you
pick<00:04:40.090> it<00:04:40.240> up<00:04:40.330> it<00:04:40.510> doesn't<00:04:40.870> feel<00:04:41.050> like<00:04:41.110> a

00:04:41.310 --> 00:04:41.320 
pick it up it doesn't feel like a

00:04:41.320 --> 00:04:43.200 
pick it up it doesn't feel like a
totally<00:04:41.680> different<00:04:41.740> controller<00:04:42.340> it<00:04:43.030> feels

00:04:43.200 --> 00:04:43.210 
totally different controller it feels

00:04:43.210 --> 00:04:45.300 
totally different controller it feels
like<00:04:43.270> a<00:04:43.390> better<00:04:43.630> controller<00:04:44.110> our<00:04:44.890> design<00:04:45.280> team
