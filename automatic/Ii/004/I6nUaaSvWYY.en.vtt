well
jacked<00:02:02.890> up<00:02:03.130> so<00:02:03.550> all<00:02:03.940> the<00:02:04.120> weight<00:02:04.410> is<00:02:05.410> off<00:02:05.680> the

00:02:05.970 --> 00:02:05.980 
jacked up so all the weight is off the

00:02:05.980 --> 00:02:09.630 
jacked up so all the weight is off the
leaf<00:02:06.130> springs<00:02:06.550> so<00:02:07.090> now<00:02:07.270> we<00:02:07.330> can<00:02:08.490> take<00:02:09.490> the

00:02:09.630 --> 00:02:09.640 
leaf springs so now we can take the

00:02:09.640 --> 00:02:11.910 
leaf springs so now we can take the
Leafs<00:02:09.880> in<00:02:10.149> Harran<00:02:10.630> so<00:02:10.960> they're<00:02:11.260> back<00:02:11.440> in<00:02:11.680> line

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:11.920 
Leafs in Harran so they're back in line

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:15.900 
Leafs in Harran so they're back in line
like<00:02:12.640> they<00:02:12.820> should<00:02:13.030> have<00:02:13.150> been<00:02:13.240> before<00:02:14.910> the

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:15.910 
like they should have been before the

00:02:15.910 --> 00:02:18.720 
like they should have been before the
Leafs<00:02:16.180> wouldn't<00:02:16.660> separate<00:02:17.400> due<00:02:18.400> to<00:02:18.580> these

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:18.730 
Leafs wouldn't separate due to these

00:02:18.730 --> 00:02:22.830 
Leafs wouldn't separate due to these
bands<00:02:19.510> so<00:02:20.080> we<00:02:20.730> simply<00:02:21.730> took<00:02:21.940> a<00:02:22.000> torch<00:02:22.570> and

00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:22.840
