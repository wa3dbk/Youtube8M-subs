00:00:12.850 --> 00:00:17.129
 of the philosophical principle of no 

00:00:14.680 --> 00:00:17.129
 contradiction 

00:00:17.539 --> 00:00:21.970
 as well as error entries 

00:00:23.650 --> 00:00:30.730

00:00:26.770 --> 00:00:32.920

00:00:30.730 --> 00:00:36.370

 to meet me and have fun that they have to 

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:56.460
 to participate is very easy 

00:00:54.629 --> 00:00:58.230
 that simply go to my official facebook 

00:00:56.460 --> 00:00:59.520
 is in the description of this video go 

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:01.170
 above all there is going to be a 

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:02.670
 publication of the event and more are going to 

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:04.589
 give account is also going to be marked 

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:06.930
 up everything more formal and get confused 

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:09.750
 we are going to like you have to comment 

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:11.310
 I'll gam if that's going to be up in the 

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:13.650
 publication to be copied europe in 

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:15.380
 there are no errors and share the image 

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:17.670
 they are simply already participating 

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:19.289
 It has to be from Buenos Aires- 

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:20.660
 obviously with the possibility of traveling 

00:01:19.289 --> 00:01:22.979
 because this is in federal capital 

00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:24.509
 now everything is going to be there in the 

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:26.520
 image in the description of the image 

00:01:24.509 --> 00:01:28.320
 so that they are guided and do not 

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:30.780
 confuse the same is not complicated anymore 

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:33.450
 we have done it several times before the 

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:36.509
 I'm going to do it on Saturday at the 

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:38.550
 night yes Saturday 10 at 10 pm 

00:01:36.509 --> 00:01:40.679
 let's do it by streaming as always 

00:01:38.550 --> 00:01:42.240
 so that they see that there is not no 

00:01:40.679 --> 00:01:43.890
 trap that there's nothing after we're going to 

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:45.690
 throw a fair with subscribers that 

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:47.160
 is always wrapped up why do I do the 

00:01:45.690 --> 00:01:49.080
 draw on Saturday because I go on 

00:01:47.160 --> 00:01:51.180
 Sunday and those who follow in the tickets 

00:01:49.080 --> 00:01:54.570
 I would be cool to go 

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:56.700
 that's why, as you know, I'm infinitely 

00:01:54.570 --> 00:02:00.710
 grateful for everything they do for me 

00:01:56.700 --> 00:02:04.020
 watch video give it and share subscribe 

00:02:00.710 --> 00:02:06.990
 do everything they do for me images 

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:08.700
 and they always send me the mail or I 

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:11.190
 go to twitter ua facebook page 

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:13.050
 and I think this is one of the best 

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:15.300
 ways to give back to you with 

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:17.490
 free tickets and that kind of thing is 

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:19.200
 a kind of vicious circle you 

00:02:17.490 --> 00:02:21.750
 subscribe they make the channel big 

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:24.959
 they invite you to places and I get tickets 

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:27.450
 to take them to you busy that and not 

00:02:24.959 --> 00:02:28.950
 much more has much more to say to them 

00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:32.450
 I appreciate everything and it is very good 

00:02:28.950 --> 00:02:32.450
 the next video that is not 

00:02:33.850 --> 00:02:36.480
 try 

00:02:48.770 --> 00:02:52.670
 It is very easy
