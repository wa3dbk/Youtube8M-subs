00:01:10.180 --> 00:01:10.190 
when you add it and mix it together it's

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:12.490 
when you add it and mix it together it's
really<00:01:10.400> pretty<00:01:11.000> pink<00:01:11.360> so<00:01:11.810> I<00:01:11.840> don't<00:01:12.260> know<00:01:12.350> maybe

00:01:12.490 --> 00:01:12.500 
really pretty pink so I don't know maybe

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:13.840 
really pretty pink so I don't know maybe
the<00:01:12.650> mechanics<00:01:13.070> wouldn't<00:01:13.340> like<00:01:13.430> it<00:01:13.580> as<00:01:13.670> well

00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:13.850 
the mechanics wouldn't like it as well

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:15.340 
the mechanics wouldn't like it as well
you<00:01:14.060> could<00:01:14.240> use<00:01:14.390> the<00:01:14.540> blue<00:01:14.720> for<00:01:14.990> that<00:01:15.020> and<00:01:15.260> be

00:01:15.340 --> 00:01:15.350 
you could use the blue for that and be

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:18.070 
you could use the blue for that and be
more<00:01:15.380> manly<00:01:15.880> and<00:01:16.880> then<00:01:17.330> all<00:01:17.420> you<00:01:17.540> do<00:01:17.630> is<00:01:17.780> add

00:01:18.070 --> 00:01:18.080 
more manly and then all you do is add

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:21.220 
more manly and then all you do is add
the<00:01:18.860> liquid<00:01:19.730> until<00:01:19.940> it<00:01:20.300> reaches<00:01:20.750> about<00:01:20.990> the

00:01:21.220 --> 00:01:21.230 
the liquid until it reaches about the

00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:24.100 
the liquid until it reaches about the
bottom<00:01:21.650> of<00:01:21.950> the<00:01:22.220> mouth<00:01:22.400> of<00:01:22.580> your<00:01:22.700> jar<00:01:22.940> and<00:01:23.690> then

00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:24.110 
bottom of the mouth of your jar and then

00:01:24.110 --> 00:01:27.580 
bottom of the mouth of your jar and then
you<00:01:24.260> just<00:01:24.440> give<00:01:24.680> it<00:01:24.830> a<00:01:25.010> stir<00:01:26.050> with<00:01:27.050> your<00:01:27.290> spoon

00:01:27.580 --> 00:01:27.590 
you just give it a stir with your spoon

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:30.430 
you just give it a stir with your spoon
and<00:01:27.890> it's<00:01:28.130> super<00:01:28.850> easy<00:01:29.030> now

00:01:30.430 --> 00:01:30.440 
and it's super easy now

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:34.180 
and it's super easy now
this<00:01:30.980> one<00:01:31.360> looks<00:01:32.360> like<00:01:32.630> it's<00:01:32.930> a<00:01:33.140> little<00:01:33.650> bit

00:01:34.180 --> 00:01:34.190 
this one looks like it's a little bit

00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:36.520 
this one looks like it's a little bit
thin<00:01:34.790> so<00:01:35.420> I'm<00:01:35.480> just<00:01:35.630> gonna<00:01:35.720> add<00:01:35.900> a<00:01:35.930> little<00:01:36.140> bit

00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:36.530 
thin so I'm just gonna add a little bit

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:38.860 
thin so I'm just gonna add a little bit
more<00:01:36.650> sugar<00:01:37.120> because<00:01:38.120> we<00:01:38.210> want<00:01:38.360> it<00:01:38.450> kind<00:01:38.690> of<00:01:38.780> a

00:01:38.860 --> 00:01:38.870 
more sugar because we want it kind of a

00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:45.850 
more sugar because we want it kind of a
scrub<00:01:39.290> consistency<00:01:43.720> and<00:01:44.720> as<00:01:45.050> it<00:01:45.230> sits<00:01:45.560> for<00:01:45.830> a

00:01:45.850 --> 00:01:45.860 
scrub consistency and as it sits for a

00:01:45.860 --> 00:01:47.170 
scrub consistency and as it sits for a
minute<00:01:46.070> it<00:01:46.190> will<00:01:46.340> thicken<00:01:46.520> up<00:01:46.700> a<00:01:46.850> little<00:01:47.000> bit

00:01:47.170 --> 00:01:47.180 
minute it will thicken up a little bit

00:01:47.180 --> 00:01:49.300 
minute it will thicken up a little bit
also<00:01:47.390> so<00:01:47.810> there<00:01:48.020> you<00:01:48.110> go<00:01:48.260> it's<00:01:48.440> kind<00:01:48.680> of<00:01:48.830> a

00:01:49.300 --> 00:01:49.310 
also so there you go it's kind of a

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:51.100 
also so there you go it's kind of a
scrub<00:01:49.670> consistency<00:01:50.420> you<00:01:50.630> might<00:01:50.750> even<00:01:50.870> add<00:01:51.080> a

00:01:51.100 --> 00:01:51.110 
scrub consistency you might even add a

00:01:51.110 --> 00:01:53.200 
scrub consistency you might even add a
little<00:01:51.200> bit<00:01:51.560> more<00:01:51.680> sugar<00:01:51.860> let's<00:01:52.730> do<00:01:52.880> this<00:01:53.000> one

00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:53.210 
little bit more sugar let's do this one

00:01:53.210 --> 00:02:03.430 
little bit more sugar let's do this one
