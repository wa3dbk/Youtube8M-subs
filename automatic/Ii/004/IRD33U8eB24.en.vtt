00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.819
 hi everybody is cooking with luca di 

00:00:02.460 --> 00:00:09.240
 this is Japan your address book 

00:00:05.819 --> 00:00:11.940
 Japanese culinary favorite today 

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:13.710
 we prepare one of the most recipes 

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:16.320
 important culinary culture 

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:21.560
 Japanese or miso soup I have 

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:24.960
 put I put shihui or whatever it is 

00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:27.029
 what it is about is the most famous soup 

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:29.849
 as I said, in fact , Japan comes 

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:32.219
 consumed both breakfast and in meals 

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:36.710
 let's complete a little from everyone today let's try 

00:00:32.219 --> 00:00:40.739
 to do it in two versions, that is from zero and 

00:00:36.710 --> 00:00:48.239
 lyophilized that fatigue after the initials vi 

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:51.750
 I show everything first we cut 

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:53.129
 diagonally a polo shirt or a spring onion in 

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:55.199
 this way 

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:58.350
 now let's take some tofu and cut it into a 

00:00:55.199 --> 00:00:59.940
 third in small cubes of about one centimeter e 

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:01.890
 let's set aside like we did with 

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:04.680
 the leek now take a sheet of the seaweed 

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:07.020
 nori cut them in four and put it on 

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:08.010
 and no glass of water for a couple of 

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:10.080
 minutes 

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:12.270
 now we squeeze and cut the 

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:13.890
 strips and also let's put them from 

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:16.200
 part that has no pot with a liter 

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:19.380
 of water we add half a tablespoon of 

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:21.150
 tap and 4 tablespoons of miso passes now 

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:23.189
 let's light a beautiful flame and do it 

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:28.200
 melt our miso pasta with 

00:01:23.189 --> 00:01:29.670
 the ski mixing well now that it boils 

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:31.530
 we can lower the flame e 

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:34.920
 let's add to burn five 

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:41.220
 minutes our leek 

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:41.220
 the seaweed and finally the tofu 

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:46.979
 Now let's mix gently so as not to 

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:48.300
 destroy the tofu before turning off 

00:01:46.979 --> 00:01:50.520
 we also put in a spoonful of 

00:01:48.300 --> 00:01:53.080
 Sesame seeds 

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:55.210
 now we can put our soup in 

00:01:53.080 --> 00:01:57.370
 a bowl and here is no 

00:01:55.210 --> 00:02:00.540
 miso hot and steaming 

00:01:57.370 --> 00:02:00.540
 let's go immediately to taste it 

00:02:05.150 --> 00:02:07.870
 very good 

00:02:11.450 --> 00:02:16.700
 the statute was soft so it melts 

00:02:14.810 --> 00:02:18.470
 right in the mouth now that it's hot 

00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:25.580
 now instead we do the other kind of 

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:27.410
 soup when instantaneous us open 

00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:29.540
 santana is the one most used in 

00:02:27.410 --> 00:02:31.310
 japan and here is one example 

00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:31.849
 sachet should also be much simpler to 

00:02:31.310 --> 00:02:34.040
 prepare 

00:02:31.849 --> 00:02:37.130
 not that the manual version is 

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:41.330
 difficult though we know this is much more 

00:02:37.130 --> 00:02:43.250
 fast what a packet of m da is needed 

00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:48.069
 pour directly into the cup e 

00:02:43.250 --> 00:02:51.410
 obviously 170 cc of boiling water 

00:02:48.069 --> 00:02:52.610
 about a cup now mixes with 

00:02:51.410 --> 00:02:54.260
 time a couple of minutes and i 

00:02:52.610 --> 00:02:56.630
 freeze-dried ingredients melt 

00:02:54.260 --> 00:03:00.890
 well and is ready and we still test 

00:02:56.630 --> 00:03:02.900
 this time the mouse is used 

00:03:00.890 --> 00:03:05.420
 a little spongy obvious doesn't hold the 

00:03:02.900 --> 00:03:08.840
 comparison with the one prepared at home 

00:03:05.420 --> 00:03:09.349
 the challenge is won by the miso soup made 

00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:12.319
 in home 

00:03:09.349 --> 00:03:15.530
 however if you want to redo it below 

00:03:12.319 --> 00:03:16.790
 in the info box I leave the book from 

00:03:15.530 --> 00:03:19.430
 the one inspired by the kitchen 

00:03:16.790 --> 00:03:20.989
 Japanese with manga and also the two sites 

00:03:19.430 --> 00:03:22.790
 of online shopping 

00:03:20.989 --> 00:03:28.459
 Sino Japanese and see you which one 

00:03:22.790 --> 00:03:29.980
 you want to use but which one I did from 

00:03:28.459 --> 00:03:35.200
 zero and definitely better 

00:03:29.980 --> 00:03:35.200
 ah well this is the rest here 

00:03:35.580 --> 00:03:42.220
 but serious and nothing 

00:03:39.700 --> 00:03:42.940
 the video ends here see you there 

00:03:42.220 --> 00:03:44.319
 next time 

00:03:42.940 --> 00:03:46.989
 below in the info boss I leave you 

00:03:44.319 --> 00:03:48.780
 also link to my facebook page where 

00:03:46.989 --> 00:03:52.180
 you can buy my shirts 

00:03:48.780 --> 00:03:53.140
 smooth lips and we see each other there 

00:03:52.180 --> 00:03:55.709
 next time 

00:03:53.140 --> 00:03:55.709
 but agree
