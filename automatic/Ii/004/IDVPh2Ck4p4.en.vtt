squeeze the first squeeze of the coconut
and<00:01:16.970> then<00:01:17.970> we<00:01:18.150> add<00:01:18.299> some<00:01:18.350> kaffir<00:01:19.350> lime<00:01:19.560> leaf

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:19.770 
and then we add some kaffir lime leaf

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:21.980 
and then we add some kaffir lime leaf
chiffonade<00:01:20.580> which<00:01:20.610> means<00:01:21.030> really<00:01:21.420> finely

sliced kaffir lime leaf is quite tough
and<00:01:24.900> if<00:01:25.320> you<00:01:25.409> don't<00:01:25.650> cut<00:01:25.890> it<00:01:26.009> thin<00:01:26.310> you'll<00:01:26.549> be

00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:26.670 
and if you don't cut it thin you'll be

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:32.950 
and if you don't cut it thin you'll be
chewing<00:01:27.060> the<00:01:27.180> whole<00:01:27.420> way<00:01:27.540> through<00:01:27.570> the<00:01:27.900> dish

00:01:32.950 --> 00:01:32.960 

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:36.740 

okay<00:01:33.960> that's<00:01:34.439> it<00:01:34.650> for<00:01:34.680> the<00:01:34.890> custard<00:01:35.220> now<00:01:35.970> to

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:36.750 
okay that's it for the custard now to

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:38.630 
okay that's it for the custard now to
make<00:01:36.930> the<00:01:37.079> little<00:01:37.229> boat<00:01:37.650> the<00:01:38.220> little<00:01:38.430> dish

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:38.640 
make the little boat the little dish

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:40.880 
make the little boat the little dish
that<00:01:38.790> we<00:01:38.880> cook<00:01:39.090> it<00:01:39.210> in<00:01:39.299> we<00:01:39.840> use<00:01:40.049> banana<00:01:40.619> leaves

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:40.890 
that we cook it in we use banana leaves

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:43.370 
that we cook it in we use banana leaves
so<00:01:41.820> we've<00:01:41.970> got<00:01:42.090> two<00:01:42.299> circles<00:01:42.810> from<00:01:42.960> the<00:01:43.110> banana

00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:43.380 
so we've got two circles from the banana

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:45.350 
so we've got two circles from the banana
leaf<00:01:43.590> and<00:01:43.770> they've<00:01:44.490> got<00:01:44.640> the<00:01:44.759> lines<00:01:45.000> running

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:45.360 
leaf and they've got the lines running

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:48.139 
leaf and they've got the lines running
down<00:01:45.479> there<00:01:45.930> just<00:01:46.740> cross<00:01:46.979> them<00:01:47.189> over<00:01:47.490> so

00:01:48.139 --> 00:01:48.149 
down there just cross them over so

00:01:48.149 --> 00:01:49.880 
down there just cross them over so
you've<00:01:48.299> got<00:01:48.420> lines<00:01:48.750> going<00:01:49.020> both<00:01:49.320> way<00:01:49.530> to<00:01:49.590> give

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:49.890 
you've got lines going both way to give

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:53.600 
you've got lines going both way to give
the<00:01:50.009> banana<00:01:50.280> more<00:01:50.790> strength<00:01:51.180> then<00:01:52.369> fold<00:01:53.369> it<00:01:53.490> in

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:53.610 
the banana more strength then fold it in

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:58.940 
the banana more strength then fold it in
and<00:01:54.079> then<00:01:55.079> staple<00:01:55.439> it<00:01:55.710> on<00:01:56.700> the<00:01:57.240> edge<00:01:57.390> and<00:01:57.950> then

00:01:58.940 --> 00:01:58.950 
and then staple it on the edge and then

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:00.679 
and then staple it on the edge and then
we<00:01:59.219> turn<00:01:59.490> it<00:01:59.610> around<00:01:59.700> directly<00:02:00.360> to<00:02:00.509> the<00:02:00.600> other

00:02:00.679 --> 00:02:00.689 
we turn it around directly to the other

00:02:00.689 --> 00:02:02.840 
we turn it around directly to the other
side<00:02:01.020> and<00:02:01.290> it's<00:02:01.770> very<00:02:02.070> important<00:02:02.640> for<00:02:02.759> the

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:02.850 
side and it's very important for the

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:06.050 
side and it's very important for the
strength<00:02:03.210> of<00:02:03.360> this<00:02:03.450> cup<00:02:03.750> to<00:02:03.990> fold<00:02:04.680> it<00:02:05.060> against

00:02:06.050 --> 00:02:06.060 
strength of this cup to fold it against

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:08.630 
strength of this cup to fold it against
so<00:02:06.479> this<00:02:06.659> is<00:02:06.810> the<00:02:06.899> opposite<00:02:07.409> way<00:02:07.649> to<00:02:08.250> this<00:02:08.369> side

00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:08.640 
so this is the opposite way to this side

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:10.910 
so this is the opposite way to this side
here<00:02:08.970> otherwise<00:02:09.629> the<00:02:10.050> boat<00:02:10.229> will<00:02:10.379> fall<00:02:10.590> apart

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:10.920 
here otherwise the boat will fall apart

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:12.510 
here otherwise the boat will fall apart
while<00:02:11.129> it's<00:02:11.280> cooking

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:12.520 
while it's cooking

00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:15.220 
while it's cooking
turn<00:02:13.520> it<00:02:13.640> to<00:02:13.790> its<00:02:13.940> side<00:02:14.120> and<00:02:14.420> then<00:02:14.810> repeat<00:02:14.960> the

00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:15.230 
turn it to its side and then repeat the

00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:25.390 
turn it to its side and then repeat the
process<00:02:15.440> a<00:02:23.770> little<00:02:24.770> bit<00:02:24.920> of<00:02:25.070> manipulation

00:02:25.390 --> 00:02:25.400 
process a little bit of manipulation

00:04:36.610 --> 00:04:36.620 
that is to use a toothpick or a skewer

00:04:36.620 --> 00:04:38.500 
that is to use a toothpick or a skewer
and<00:04:37.100> put<00:04:37.580> it<00:04:37.699> into<00:04:37.940> the<00:04:38.060> center<00:04:38.360> of<00:04:38.419> the
