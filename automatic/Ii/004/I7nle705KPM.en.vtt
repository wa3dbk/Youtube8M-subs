00:00:00.360 --> 00:00:02.100
 Hello everyone, I am RXSFAI. 

00:00:02.600 --> 00:00:06.640
 In the last Friday, I still didn't update the video. 

00:00:06.680 --> 00:00:09.940
 I am sorry to everyone here. 

00:00:10.060 --> 00:00:15.540
 The reason I can't update is because I don't have much time to cut the video every day. 

00:00:15.700 --> 00:00:22.080
 So in the coming Friday, those about the introduction of equipment are still updated from time to time. 

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:27.360
 The equipment series video will be unchanged on Tuesdays and will be updated every week. 

00:00:27.580 --> 00:00:32.180
 If you have equipment, I want to try it out and make a test. 

00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:34.140
 Can leave a message here or on my Facebook page 

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:38.660
 I will randomly select the video for the next week. 

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:43.080
 This time the equipment was provided by the AudiGTR100. 

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:45.160
 The main weapon is AWS 

00:00:45.280 --> 00:00:51.620
 Accessories use full-image scope, magnifying glass, R2 silencer, upright grip 

00:00:51.940 --> 00:00:54.380
 Pistol using M1911 

00:00:54.740 --> 00:01:00.940
 Accessories use sight [3X], green point laser sight, QSW-06 silencer 

00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:04.340
 Equipment is equipped with one: missile shield / M224 mortar 

00:01:04.340 --> 00:01:06.680
 Equipped with two ammunition boxes 

00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:09.480
 Grenade selection RGO grenades 

00:01:10.220 --> 00:01:13.600
 There is also a BJ-2 saber, skill [ghost] 

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:17.280
 The full name of AWS is Ares Defense Shrike 

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:20.780
 The official name of the gun is Ares Shrike 5.56 

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:24.900
 AWS is a modified version of the M16 series gun. 

00:01:25.220 --> 00:01:28.620
 Internally modified parts using light machine guns 

00:01:28.900 --> 00:01:31.860
 Turned the M16 into a light machine gun 

00:01:32.260 --> 00:01:37.060
 So all aspects of AWS performance is very close to M16A4 

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:41.060
 Some people may have found my data on the map 

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:44.080
 The rate of fire is written to shoot 780 rounds per minute instead of 800 

00:01:44.360 --> 00:01:48.000
 You are not mistaken, but I am not wrong. 

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:50.700
 Because after the left fall patch update 

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:53.680
 AWS's rate of fire is weakened to 780 

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:56.400
 Just the battlelog does not update the number 

00:01:56.400 --> 00:02:00.820
 Although 20 RPM is missing, you still feel the same as the M16A4. 

00:02:01.120 --> 00:02:04.020
 However, AWS is still different from M16A4. 

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:08.420
 In addition to being not semi-automatic, there are more bullets in AWS. 

00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:11.340
 And the 100 rounds of bullets are carried by bombs. 

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:15.380
 So compared to most light machine guns, the speed of changing the bomb is faster. 

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:18.560
 AWS takes 3.5 seconds to change 

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:20.400
 Because it is using a drum 

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:24.960
 Therefore, it is necessary to change the bomb after using the photon bullet. 

00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:28.480
 Make the change time longer to 4.85 seconds 

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:30.960
 So after each fire 

00:02:30.960 --> 00:02:33.660
 Keep an eye out for the rest of your bullets. 

00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:35.460
 On the recoil 

00:02:35.460 --> 00:02:38.980
 AWS is lower than other light machine guns 

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:44.700
 Attacking enemies within 100m, you can't feel much recoil when you press it tightly. 

00:02:45.020 --> 00:02:48.800
 If you put a fire cap on the barrel fittings 

00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:52.540
 It's easier to control the recoil of AWS 

00:02:52.840 --> 00:02:57.140
 However, when the fire cap is installed, the diffusion value will become higher. 

00:02:57.300 --> 00:03:00.180
 It makes you seem to hit 20 rounds before hitting 1 round. 

00:03:00.520 --> 00:03:03.600
 So if you are a habit to play a little farther away 

00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:06.500
 I recommend using a heavy barrel. 

00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:10.200
 Using a silencer is also a good choice 

00:03:10.210 --> 00:03:14.170
 Because AWS has a large number of bullets, the bombing time is also very short. 

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:21.170
 These features are paired with a silencer that will make you very useful when attacking 

00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:23.000
 On the choice of grip 

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:26.240
 Because AWS opened the first shot, the recoil is not very big. 

00:03:26.240 --> 00:03:29.200
 So I don't think about choosing a right angle grip. 

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:34.280
 Get used to suppressing shooting enemies while walking, you can choose comfortable grip 

00:03:34.580 --> 00:03:40.210
 I am used to shooting, I want to play far and accurate, you can choose a wide grip. 

00:03:40.700 --> 00:03:45.100
 AWS is a gun that is easy to master and control. 

00:03:46.020 --> 00:03:49.090
 Due to low recoil and high accuracy 

00:03:49.090 --> 00:03:52.240
 So even if you launch by real, you can easily kill the enemy. 

00:03:52.240 --> 00:03:57.300
 Have a very fast rate of fire in a light machine gun 

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:01.130
 There will be certain advantages when communicating at close range 

00:04:01.130 --> 00:04:05.080
 In addition, since you are a support soldier, you don't have to worry about missing bullets. 

00:04:05.080 --> 00:04:10.270
 So AWS can be considered to be the strongest light machine gun to some extent. 

00:04:11.100 --> 00:04:17.500
 Finally, compare the other two more common light machine guns: M249 and MG4 

00:04:17.900 --> 00:04:23.190
 In terms of performance, AWS's rebound speed is faster and accuracy is better. 

00:04:23.190 --> 00:04:30.200
 The attack power of the three light machine guns is the same, with a maximum damage of 24 and a minimum of 18 

00:04:30.200 --> 00:04:32.700
 After comparing multiple performances 

00:04:32.180 --> 00:04:38.140
 Many players with Navy Storm or Premium membership also use AWS. 

00:04:38.760 --> 00:04:43.140
 AWS gives me the feeling that it is the machine gun version of ACE23. 

00:04:43.140 --> 00:04:47.200
 Because their rate of fire and recoil are similar 

00:04:47.200 --> 00:04:51.760
 It feels the same on the hand 

00:04:51.760 --> 00:04:55.000
 I will think of AWS as an ACE23 with 100 bullets. 

00:04:55.000 --> 00:05:00.020
 And this is why I won’t use this gun any more. 

00:05:00.100 --> 00:05:03.020
 AWS is of course a good gun 

00:05:03.020 --> 00:05:05.170
 But use this gun for too long 

00:05:05.170 --> 00:05:08.020
 Will become difficult to improve their technology 

00:05:08.020 --> 00:05:11.040
 Make yourself a gun performance 

00:05:11.040 --> 00:05:14.070
 Instead of using your own technology to win every game 

00:05:14.090 --> 00:05:17.210
 So if it’s not the enemy’s technology, 

00:05:17.210 --> 00:05:21.240
 I should not use this gun any more. 

00:05:22.070 --> 00:05:25.110
 If you are a rookie, you can’t kill too many enemies. 

00:05:25.120 --> 00:05:29.090
 Using AWS should make you pick up your confidence 

00:05:29.180 --> 00:05:33.030
 However, if you already have some experience and strength 

00:05:33.060 --> 00:05:36.220
 I suggest you try to use other guns. 

00:05:36.220 --> 00:05:39.160
 Continue to improve your technology 

00:05:39.200 --> 00:05:42.000
 I said it this time. 

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:45.270
