00:00:05.549 --> 00:00:09.450
 last af series of the last recording moment 

00:00:07.799 --> 00:00:10.320

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:13.650
 all sorts of 

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:16.619
 various interesting things first of 

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:18.690
 which guys is the demolition of a huge mountain 

00:00:16.619 --> 00:00:19.770
 here was a huge mountain who remembers that 

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:21.630
 watched the last series 

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:23.609
 he must remember her who did not look 

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:25.680
 be sure to look and make sure that I 

00:00:23.609 --> 00:00:28.050
 telling the truth here was a huge mountain i 

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:31.650
 Carried them in manual mode with a pickaxe 

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:33.719
 lighthouse and great diligence 4 article abrupt 

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:34.890
 hours demanded to carry 

00:00:33.719 --> 00:00:37.770
 completely this mountain 

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:40.590
 Yes, guys, this is a big deal 

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:42.690
 but I still did it and in principle 

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:45.300
 I really like the result now here 

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:47.039
 everything is perfectly patched wonderful 

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:50.520
 grass under 7 4 height 

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:53.070
 here came the wonderful red sheep 

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:54.570
 sheep which i also required for 

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:56.670
 building my fence 

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:58.800
 we need them here for this 

00:00:56.670 --> 00:01:00.420
 carpet see you see red 

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:02.520
 carpet and this is your own fence 

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:04.049
 the kingdom is inside the fence guys up to many 

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:06.420
 something people think that this castle 

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:09.270
 of course it looks very much like a lock on 

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:12.840
 in fact, guys are not a castle, but an ordinary one 

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:15.090
 the fence gave a little big yes ok he 

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:17.970
 big it looks like a medieval castle 

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:20.909
 but still this fence I call it 

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:23.790
 fence let this fence be here with us 

00:01:20.909 --> 00:01:26.460
 there are times tower 2 tower three towers and there 

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:28.710
 4 more towers already four towers ready and not 

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:32.460
 big spans are also ready think to 

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:34.890
 to the moment of the new year yes here is the wind I am so 

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:38.070
 I say once there is no record next 

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:39.780
 Series A by the time of the new year 2016 

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:43.140
 all the same I will be able to build this 

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:45.299
 wonderful fence around the circumference 

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:46.229
 my wonderful manor but I don't know 

00:01:45.299 --> 00:01:48.630
 whether it will work or not 

00:01:46.229 --> 00:01:51.689
 make one tower and a couple of spans 

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:53.700
 about an hour of time guys and this is very 

00:01:51.689 --> 00:01:56.250
 sad and lesson so long for him not 

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:57.990
 I can sit I leave the poison of this place 

00:01:56.250 --> 00:02:00.119
 I am leaving and cannot build everything for a long time 

00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:02.700
 near my warehouse also appeared 

00:02:00.119 --> 00:02:04.969
 the inscription is not even near the guys and right in 

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:07.439
 stock inscription appeared by the way oh 

00:02:04.969 --> 00:02:09.420
 the wheat has ripened it very well and 

00:02:07.439 --> 00:02:12.780
 probably many of you have already asked 

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:13.560
 questions or I immediately had firms 

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:16.290
 smoking 

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:17.280
 prices where did they go and I'll tell you they 

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:21.750
 don't go anywhere 

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:25.260
 they were here I took it and moved it 

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:28.410
 here put the sound of a chicken so here they are 

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:30.440
 my chicken coop here it is my company 

00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:33.330
 Chicken is a huge chicken farm 

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:36.030
 the air there are many eggs are rushing all 

00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:37.830
 everything works cool cool fashion 

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:40.200
 stylish youth like this 

00:02:37.830 --> 00:02:42.209
 goes the gutter see the pipe goes goes goes and 

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:45.060
 also gets into the sorting so here 

00:02:42.209 --> 00:02:47.160
 everything is automated and food as I have already and 

00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:49.739
 spoke me enough for long long 

00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:51.510
 for many centuries probably even another three 

00:02:49.739 --> 00:02:54.900
 generations ahead have enough food that I 

00:02:51.510 --> 00:02:57.720
 procured and here it is the most blink 

00:02:54.900 --> 00:03:00.140
 left inscription in this world krauzer here 

00:02:57.720 --> 00:03:02.790
 she is a huge huge inscription 

00:03:00.140 --> 00:03:04.650
 this inscription guys i built today on 

00:03:02.790 --> 00:03:06.239
 stirrup basically strollo enough and and 

00:03:04.650 --> 00:03:08.670
 long because I don't have the skill 

00:03:06.239 --> 00:03:11.090
 will remain in such large inscriptions in 

00:03:08.670 --> 00:03:13.799
 principle, if a little bit to adapt 

00:03:11.090 --> 00:03:15.299
 can be built fast enough after 

00:03:13.799 --> 00:03:17.099
 This inscription there will be a small such 

00:03:15.299 --> 00:03:19.079
 dash and it will be written Krauser 

00:03:17.099 --> 00:03:21.150
 youtube is an inscription Hollywood in America 

00:03:19.079 --> 00:03:22.950
 here we also have youtube's krauser 

00:03:21.150 --> 00:03:26.040
 In principle, it seems quite good even 

00:03:22.950 --> 00:03:28.320
 My idea is my next 

00:03:26.040 --> 00:03:29.970
 find in this world for hours first show 

00:03:28.320 --> 00:03:30.989
 what i built from this find 

00:03:29.970 --> 00:03:34.109
 then I'll show you where I am 

00:03:30.989 --> 00:03:36.630
 saw and so i built from this 

00:03:34.109 --> 00:03:38.940
 wonderful finds here such 

00:03:36.630 --> 00:03:40.500
 stock to guys drop dead green 

00:03:38.940 --> 00:03:42.660
 cool color now I have 

00:03:40.500 --> 00:03:44.370
 any kind of poisonous shit is kept 

00:03:42.660 --> 00:03:46.799
 potato pile of gold type balls 

00:03:44.370 --> 00:03:48.720
 trashcan green dark green such 

00:03:46.799 --> 00:03:51.540
 marine color is now show you where 

00:03:48.720 --> 00:03:53.730
 I found them I found them in even actually 

00:03:51.540 --> 00:03:56.040
 speaking basically genius spawn it 

00:03:53.730 --> 00:03:57.750
 even called sea fortress also in 

00:03:56.040 --> 00:03:59.670
 this dungeon i will tell you now that i 

00:03:57.750 --> 00:04:01.260
 i found i also found sponges in it 

00:03:59.670 --> 00:04:03.750
 only I don't remember where I put them here 

00:04:01.260 --> 00:04:05.639
 they are sponge guys i basically went 

00:04:03.750 --> 00:04:07.319
 why did I go to look for these sponges ? 

00:04:05.639 --> 00:04:09.120
 I needed to dry something there I 

00:04:07.319 --> 00:04:10.970
 I do not remember that I need something 

00:04:09.120 --> 00:04:12.989
 dry and I realized that the best way 

00:04:10.970 --> 00:04:15.120
 draining the surface 

00:04:12.989 --> 00:04:17.789
 using sponges so i went them 

00:04:15.120 --> 00:04:19.979
 search and actually I found taj 

00:04:17.789 --> 00:04:21.659
 This dina went on and in principle I 

00:04:19.979 --> 00:04:23.400
 really freaked out that he found 

00:04:21.659 --> 00:04:26.400
 like this, in principle, the sponge removes water 

00:04:23.400 --> 00:04:27.180
 then it gets wet here and so 

00:04:26.400 --> 00:04:29.220
 here she is very 

00:04:27.180 --> 00:04:32.430
 asna land and then you just take this 

00:04:29.220 --> 00:04:34.979
 you put a wet sponge in the stove and she 

00:04:32.430 --> 00:04:37.289
 it dries using charcoal without a furnace 

00:04:34.979 --> 00:04:39.419
 burning bugs the sponge and everything 

00:04:37.289 --> 00:04:41.490
 it turns back such a sponge is dry who 

00:04:39.419 --> 00:04:42.840
 can work again and is ready for business 

00:04:41.490 --> 00:04:45.030
 in short they are reusable 

00:04:42.840 --> 00:04:47.280
 which is also cool first went to look 

00:04:45.030 --> 00:04:49.530
 this one is further to find a sponge I 

00:04:47.280 --> 00:04:53.100
 came found then by the way quickly found 

00:04:49.530 --> 00:04:56.660
 enough but what trouble happened when 

00:04:53.100 --> 00:04:59.490
 I found here even began to explore it and 

00:04:56.660 --> 00:05:01.680
 It turned out that I did not find one 

00:04:59.490 --> 00:05:04.259
 sponges began to me immediately in the chat to write on 

00:05:01.680 --> 00:05:06.900
 Stream heat Ilha da pancake there is not all the same 

00:05:04.259 --> 00:05:09.660
 and even they are different in sponges 

00:05:06.900 --> 00:05:12.150
 sponges are not in all the data and you 

00:05:09.660 --> 00:05:15.539
 need to find another yes he should be in 

00:05:12.150 --> 00:05:17.759
 Ocean names and all that I have such a short 

00:05:15.539 --> 00:05:19.919
 I think maybe yes I climbed on mycraft 

00:05:17.759 --> 00:05:22.560
 wiki and actually there in mykraft 

00:05:19.919 --> 00:05:26.580
 Wiki wrote that all the same further 

00:05:22.560 --> 00:05:28.740
 I think about this and all the dungeons are the same 

00:05:26.580 --> 00:05:30.539
 then you need to look further I started 

00:05:28.740 --> 00:05:32.310
 disassemble the same with the help of lighthouse picks 

00:05:30.539 --> 00:05:34.139
 just started swimming like this 

00:05:32.310 --> 00:05:35.520
 water and disassemble it dan live here 

00:05:34.139 --> 00:05:37.050
 dofiga already dismantled was actually 

00:05:35.520 --> 00:05:39.570
 heights up to the court from here he was 

00:05:37.050 --> 00:05:41.159
 the heights of the guys here are these two blocks 

00:05:39.570 --> 00:05:42.210
 exactly stood on this dungeon present 

00:05:41.159 --> 00:05:44.880
 what a garden he was and how much I already 

00:05:42.210 --> 00:05:46.800
 I disassembled and so I began to disassemble it and 

00:05:44.880 --> 00:05:50.130
 just show now where the cadets are here 

00:05:46.800 --> 00:05:52.800
 here yes here here I am somewhere somewhere here in 

00:05:50.130 --> 00:05:56.130
 this hole is shorter i stumbled upon these 

00:05:52.800 --> 00:05:59.250
 wet sponge and then immediately around 

00:05:56.130 --> 00:06:04.289
 This place I still found 8 guys 

00:05:59.250 --> 00:06:05.849
 think about 8 blocks of gold but in short I 

00:06:04.289 --> 00:06:07.949
 generally wanted to find it all by 

00:06:05.849 --> 00:06:10.259
 photos there were photos where 

00:06:07.949 --> 00:06:13.770
 are located these 

00:06:10.259 --> 00:06:15.300
 wonderful so to speak sponges and angry and 

00:06:13.770 --> 00:06:17.430
 troubles and has 100 it was written that 

00:06:15.300 --> 00:06:18.659
 they are located in the center actually 

00:06:17.430 --> 00:06:21.150
 I found them not in the center seems to me 

00:06:18.659 --> 00:06:22.650
 little can be right here well short 

00:06:21.150 --> 00:06:26.070
 now he showed somewhere places here center 

00:06:22.650 --> 00:06:28.440
 toms show a little to the right they did not find 

00:06:26.070 --> 00:06:31.159
 I know guys, maybe I just have kaidash 

00:06:28.440 --> 00:06:33.630
 some strange got and maybe 

00:06:31.159 --> 00:06:35.070
 generation is not everywhere in one place I do not know 

00:06:33.630 --> 00:06:37.050
 maybe this is the center maybe 

00:06:35.070 --> 00:06:38.969
 just somehow I looked wrong but in 

00:06:37.050 --> 00:06:40.710
 general himself was found that all the collected heap 

00:06:38.969 --> 00:06:42.960
 blocks and the principle of having a bunch of blog 

00:06:40.710 --> 00:06:45.000
 u still even had a bunch of it 

00:06:42.960 --> 00:06:46.290
 blocks so i think that if i 

00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:47.790
 still want to build something from these 

00:06:46.290 --> 00:06:49.860
 beautiful blocks prismarine here 

00:06:47.790 --> 00:06:52.440
 all sorts of cool green blocks 

00:06:49.860 --> 00:06:54.990
 then I will just turn to this place 

00:06:52.440 --> 00:06:56.700
 drop some more blocks and I'll be sitting on 

00:06:54.990 --> 00:06:58.320
 very happy to see and then there 

00:06:56.700 --> 00:07:00.600
 I have my own 

00:06:58.320 --> 00:07:02.820
 parse on the blog, in principle, all the guys
