00:00:13.430 --> 00:00:19.680
 so people and welcome back 

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:23.640
 in angeles city and that means again 

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:25.470
 back in titan full yes a little bit 

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:28.410
 time has already passed again 

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:29.970
 last i share about full and 

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:32.730
 the first impressions spoken 

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:37.559
 I would like to talk about the topic today 

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:39.120
 titan full without titans is a topic where 

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:42.420
 I honestly thought too 

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:45.000
 did it because this game 

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:47.460
 just very very call of duty is funny 

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:48.239
 and you notice the influence of course 

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:50.340
 extreme 

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:54.690
 and of course I'm wondering in this one 

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:57.120
 form would you a title without titans 

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:59.129
 buy and I have to say quite honestly 

00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:01.350
 I would even prefer it if there is one 

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:03.449
 give game mode where you would have no times 

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:06.149
 then of course you can be extreme 

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:09.569
 Focus on that only 

00:01:06.149 --> 00:01:12.240
 Objective goes and says you even try 

00:01:09.569 --> 00:01:14.580
 he does not go to these titles because 

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:16.380
 Have you ever tried playing? 

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:18.750
 a complete round without the 

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:21.390
 That means you rock 

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:22.170
 or better puts yourself in question says 

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:25.410
 you squat down 

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:27.929
 take a titan with your choice 

00:01:25.410 --> 00:01:29.369
 and then he just says good I play 

00:01:27.929 --> 00:01:31.890
 just without the title 

00:01:29.369 --> 00:01:33.330
 Just look at what's going on without 

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:35.520
 give the title what you want for 

00:01:33.330 --> 00:01:37.410
 possibilities with that I am 

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:40.289
 personally a very big friend 

00:01:37.410 --> 00:01:42.959
 of playing without titan because I then 

00:01:40.289 --> 00:01:44.729
 definitely play more objective 

00:01:42.959 --> 00:01:46.319
 You can then more on the 

00:01:44.729 --> 00:01:48.270
 fight against the infantrymen 

00:01:46.319 --> 00:01:50.300
 Of course you have to focus on that 

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:52.590
 The place sometimes say that this 

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:54.630
 infantryman versus infantryman fight 

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:57.840
 this, of course, extremely in the 

00:01:54.630 --> 00:02:00.989
 foreground has slipped when the 

00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:02.399
 titan omits as a little tip here 

00:02:00.989 --> 00:02:04.560
 I also do a lot of jobs 

00:02:02.399 --> 00:02:06.660
 also seen that many use the 

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:08.580
 Take the dough with you and do this 

00:02:06.660 --> 00:02:10.560
 car mode of the title to that is the 

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:12.900
 title then runs accordingly 

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:15.569
 protect yourself with it a bit 

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:16.230
 have a little buffer and to that effect 

00:02:15.569 --> 00:02:18.330
 is 

00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:20.220
 also important that currently a bit 

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:22.200
 What does I have my title here 

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:24.349
 Called now let's first 

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:28.170
 should stand around with that 

00:02:24.349 --> 00:02:29.700
 sack of that I grabbed and if 

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:32.549
 then died himself and he was is 

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:33.900
 ran after me and well, happened 

00:02:32.549 --> 00:02:36.780
 sometimes decide that one 

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:38.580
 is somehow killed around the corner and 

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:40.739
 not heard the opponent or 

00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:41.989
 not the opponent hears it 

00:02:40.739 --> 00:02:43.799
 just a story 

00:02:41.989 --> 00:02:47.519
 Now we'll see this again 

00:02:43.799 --> 00:02:48.690
 second mode so i like sharing 

00:02:47.519 --> 00:02:50.280
 little sales here 

00:02:48.690 --> 00:02:52.829
 as I said you have to stop altogether 

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:56.160
 honestly think I do not may 

00:02:52.829 --> 00:02:58.980
 call of duty that really a kink 

00:02:56.160 --> 00:02:59.549
 got replaced by actions full 

00:02:58.980 --> 00:03:01.950
 become 

00:02:59.549 --> 00:03:04.019
 I have to say honestly no me 

00:03:01.950 --> 00:03:06.750
 Do not believe it because call is on duty 

00:03:04.019 --> 00:03:09.980
 just a franchise that is so blatant 

00:03:06.750 --> 00:03:12.180
 has now established it is also 

00:03:09.980 --> 00:03:15.120
 really not what it used to be 

00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:17.190
 Of course that's just the way you have to 

00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:19.620
 meanwhile it will be enough for that 

00:03:17.190 --> 00:03:23.130
 German community done in call of duty 

00:03:19.620 --> 00:03:25.590
 You try as much as you can 

00:03:23.130 --> 00:03:27.329
 goes to the user wishes to enter 

00:03:25.590 --> 00:03:29.400
 so if I look at what the 

00:03:27.329 --> 00:03:31.560
 German community manager for the people 

00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:33.750
 I'll do that out there 

00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:35.400
 say really good and I like it 

00:03:33.750 --> 00:03:37.709
 a shame that you out there that then 

00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:40.440
 also does not use because there is someone 

00:03:37.709 --> 00:03:43.049
 the one who takes care of all this 

00:03:40.440 --> 00:03:44.250
 thematics that means that makes you one 

00:03:43.049 --> 00:03:47.069
 livestream for example we have 

00:03:44.250 --> 00:03:48.720
 recently streamed together with the 

00:03:47.069 --> 00:03:51.180
 people from sk gaming together 

00:03:48.720 --> 00:03:53.160
 there was the possibility in the 

00:03:51.180 --> 00:03:54.750
 ask live stream directly to the 

00:03:53.160 --> 00:03:55.470
 developer or has too 

00:03:54.750 --> 00:03:57.060
 improvements 

00:03:55.470 --> 00:03:59.849
 Of course he will continue right away 

00:03:57.060 --> 00:04:02.819
 Guided and that has things too 

00:03:59.849 --> 00:04:07.739
 because I asked myself why so little 

00:04:02.819 --> 00:04:10.650
 people apologize 

00:04:07.739 --> 00:04:11.730
 I beg me really I swallowed 

00:04:10.650 --> 00:04:13.379
 then really ask me why look 

00:04:11.730 --> 00:04:13.739
 so few people watch this live stream 

00:04:13.379 --> 00:04:16.380
 on 

00:04:13.739 --> 00:04:18.449
 there you have the possibility just once 

00:04:16.380 --> 00:04:18.989
 something to say or something under it 

00:04:18.449 --> 00:04:21.539
 write 

00:04:18.989 --> 00:04:22.860
 Well that means we put it there 

00:04:21.539 --> 00:04:24.150
 play so primarily want a little 

00:04:22.860 --> 00:04:26.460
 what about sharing full talk 

00:04:24.150 --> 00:04:27.550
 it's not long before we dispute it 

00:04:26.460 --> 00:04:30.590
 manages 

00:04:27.550 --> 00:04:33.020
 So you have enough time in the beta 

00:04:30.590 --> 00:04:35.600
 to make his impression of 

00:04:33.020 --> 00:04:38.210
 the game and I think you have some 

00:04:35.600 --> 00:04:39.890
 get points right and can do it 

00:04:38.210 --> 00:04:41.270
 you definitely build and me 

00:04:39.890 --> 00:04:43.240
 think other developers should 

00:04:41.270 --> 00:04:47.030
 take an example 

00:04:43.240 --> 00:04:48.380
 such open beta for me it was not 

00:04:47.030 --> 00:04:49.840
 monastery somehow you your invitation 

00:04:48.380 --> 00:04:53.570
 but do not care 

00:04:49.840 --> 00:04:54.980
 take an example so that speaks 

00:04:53.570 --> 00:04:58.910
 now directly to the developers 

00:04:54.980 --> 00:05:01.220
 really take an example completely 

00:04:58.910 --> 00:05:04.040
 here is really this appeal to the call 

00:05:01.220 --> 00:05:06.590
 of duty developer invites people to visit 

00:05:04.040 --> 00:05:08.900
 Let the test this time it was also 

00:05:06.590 --> 00:05:10.310
 a closed beta the people should 

00:05:08.900 --> 00:05:11.690
 I want to play a little feedback 

00:05:10.310 --> 00:05:13.880
 to give up arms and not only 

00:05:11.690 --> 00:05:14.870
 23 days because then you can be clear 

00:05:13.880 --> 00:05:16.400
 you can make a judgment about it 

00:05:14.870 --> 00:05:18.380
 but then most of it is already from 

00:05:16.400 --> 00:05:20.210
 I think it would be better if you could 

00:05:18.380 --> 00:05:21.880
 says you have the possibility of the game 

00:05:20.210 --> 00:05:23.780
 intensive times to test 

00:05:21.880 --> 00:05:26.660
 because he does not believe that people 

00:05:23.780 --> 00:05:28.730
 who are now working on call of duty yet 

00:05:26.660 --> 00:05:31.430
 not finished but it will be 

00:05:28.730 --> 00:05:33.950
 certainly already something project give 

00:05:31.430 --> 00:05:35.120
 not playable yes you have to stop it 

00:05:33.950 --> 00:05:37.190
 always a bit superior but you 

00:05:35.120 --> 00:05:39.669
 Of course you should also like people 

00:05:37.190 --> 00:05:42.140
 the community in such concepts or in 

00:05:39.669 --> 00:05:44.540
 I think there is work involved 

00:05:42.140 --> 00:05:47.570
 and I think it's great very well done 

00:05:44.540 --> 00:05:49.940
 Of course these have these titans in the 

00:05:47.570 --> 00:05:52.310
 moved foreground and that is 

00:05:49.940 --> 00:05:54.979
 actually the foreground of this 

00:05:52.310 --> 00:05:57.979
 whole game but that's mine too 

00:05:54.979 --> 00:06:00.530
 Criticism of sharing the problem 

00:05:57.979 --> 00:06:02.180
 contain the full titans are mine 

00:06:00.530 --> 00:06:05.690
 for being in the foreground 

00:06:02.180 --> 00:06:08.660
 of the whole are far too easy 

00:06:05.690 --> 00:06:10.729
 that means you have to keep calling and 

00:06:08.660 --> 00:06:12.860
 then fight it's nothing 

00:06:10.729 --> 00:06:13.729
 tactical one can indeed dodge one 

00:06:12.860 --> 00:06:15.560
 can not jump 

00:06:13.729 --> 00:06:17.090
 you can move a bit and 

00:06:15.560 --> 00:06:19.130
 that was it actually has one 

00:06:17.090 --> 00:06:20.990
 couple of perks in quotation marks at 

00:06:19.130 --> 00:06:23.330
 but his tactics were really tactical 

00:06:20.990 --> 00:06:24.500
 possibilities one did not have it there 

00:06:23.330 --> 00:06:26.820
 much more blatant in the past 

00:06:24.500 --> 00:06:29.820
 mechwarrior games where you 

00:06:26.820 --> 00:06:32.940
 definitely on tactics in this area 

00:06:29.820 --> 00:06:34.860
 gone on can split it up fully 

00:06:32.940 --> 00:06:36.770
 every case still construction there I find synonymous 

00:06:34.860 --> 00:06:39.030
 is shared a bit before 

00:06:36.770 --> 00:06:41.880
 technology that existed from before 

00:06:39.030 --> 00:06:42.780
 because I think so I think so 

00:06:41.880 --> 00:06:44.750
 is my opinion 

00:06:42.780 --> 00:06:47.070
 was there really? 

00:06:44.750 --> 00:06:48.750
 more professional things though 

00:06:47.070 --> 00:06:50.250
 Nonetheless, there are no plans for me 

00:06:48.750 --> 00:06:52.260
 have known a game for a long time 

00:06:50.250 --> 00:06:54.390
 again I did not move on 

00:06:52.260 --> 00:06:55.740
 a card to watch in the game but 

00:06:54.390 --> 00:06:58.740
 Just enjoy the game too 

00:06:55.740 --> 00:07:01.560
 play and say no matter I have one 

00:06:58.740 --> 00:07:02.730
 Round with 10 to ten where interested him 

00:07:01.560 --> 00:07:04.290
 Two nobody looks at the card 

00:07:02.730 --> 00:07:06.300
 still bothered to run over 

00:07:04.290 --> 00:07:08.610
 to jump the houses and that's what 

00:07:06.300 --> 00:07:09.780
 what I find cool if a game that 

00:07:08.610 --> 00:07:13.110
 can also embody 

00:07:09.780 --> 00:07:18.000
 This joy in the game and I think so 

00:07:13.110 --> 00:07:21.720
 really top I think so 

00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:24.630
 and that's why I'm curious if 

00:07:21.720 --> 00:07:26.100
 Titan also has a full mode without 

00:07:24.630 --> 00:07:27.240
 second, because that's what it is 

00:07:26.100 --> 00:07:29.660
 I personally wish that still 

00:07:27.240 --> 00:07:31.650
 more on the subjectively can and 

00:07:29.660 --> 00:07:33.630
 it's your turn now 

00:07:31.650 --> 00:07:35.670
 Write me something below you 

00:07:33.630 --> 00:07:38.130
 at the titan vorbeter until now am 

00:07:35.670 --> 00:07:40.980
 liked best and what you guys 

00:07:38.130 --> 00:07:41.900
 maybe what you want to change 

00:07:40.980 --> 00:07:45.540
 would 

00:07:41.900 --> 00:07:47.310
 I think you should leave a lot 

00:07:45.540 --> 00:07:49.020
 I heard what would change 

00:07:47.310 --> 00:07:51.800
 and I'll do it for sure, I still have it 

00:07:49.020 --> 00:07:53.820
 two three videos on the box before the 

00:07:51.800 --> 00:07:55.560
 player determined i will definitely go again 

00:07:53.820 --> 00:07:57.390
 but currently only on the weekend I 

00:07:55.560 --> 00:07:58.890
 I just have enough work to do 

00:07:57.390 --> 00:08:01.400
 and that 's why I'm at the 

00:07:58.890 --> 00:08:01.400
 put out
