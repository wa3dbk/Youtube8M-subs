00:00:00.410 --> 00:00:04.700
 We continue to study the market of finished jelly 

00:00:03.130 --> 00:00:07.939
 today's instance 

00:00:04.700 --> 00:00:11.330
 Cherry in jelly from Rosagroexport worth 

00:00:07.939 --> 00:00:13.370
 Here we look so much composition as 

00:00:11.330 --> 00:00:16.789
 gelling agent is not used here 

00:00:13.370 --> 00:00:20.330
 gelatin and respected Kara sofa or 

00:00:16.789 --> 00:00:22.070
 scientifically e 407 is a thickener 

00:00:20.330 --> 00:00:23.840
 derived from algae 

00:00:22.070 --> 00:00:26.060
 which the chinese use when 

00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:30.050
 cooking already one and a half thousand 

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:33.469
 years that is it is not chemistry fuck however in 

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:35.989
 2004 Carrageenan banned in Europe 

00:00:33.469 --> 00:00:38.629
 how did it happen five thousand five hundred 

00:00:35.989 --> 00:00:40.730
 years ago no gamma with chemistry and in 

00:00:38.629 --> 00:00:42.559
 Mention was not mined him from 

00:00:40.730 --> 00:00:44.420
 seaweed they are green 

00:00:42.559 --> 00:00:47.480
 and if something is green then she is 

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:49.340
 This is a very useful Chinese as a 

00:00:47.480 --> 00:00:51.199
 multiply despite the fact that 

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:53.059
 one and a half thousand years eat carrageenan 

00:00:51.199 --> 00:00:54.920
 and here it is enough to call 

00:00:53.059 --> 00:00:56.719
 substance on the letter e and she immediately 

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:58.579
 becomes a scarecrow for the townsfolk 

00:00:56.719 --> 00:01:00.980
 turns banned 

00:00:58.579 --> 00:01:03.350
 not because it is harmful to adults 

00:01:00.980 --> 00:01:06.950
 because babies began to choke 

00:01:03.350 --> 00:01:09.440
 well if the parents are so stupid and give 

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:12.350
 small children jelly then with the same success 

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:15.080
 you can ban bread which can also 

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:17.720
 choke and die of choking if he 

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:19.760
 I get into the wrong throat, I think 

00:01:17.720 --> 00:01:21.770
 it's time to stop banning anything 

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:25.580
 just because there is a world 

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:28.580
 stupid people it touches everything from food and 

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:31.010
 music to religion and weapons oh well 

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:33.680
 taste the jelly nice and 

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:35.870
 like a frozen compote although no 

00:01:33.680 --> 00:01:38.900
 grandma's cherry compote smells than 

00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:41.690
 besides cherries , it is taste here 

00:01:38.900 --> 00:01:43.460
 fresh cherry and it is caused by flavoring 

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:45.740
 identical to natural 

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:48.920
 do you think they put him there because 

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:51.020
 what the fuck you want no at all in 

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:52.640
 first on the planet just is not so much 

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:54.830
 cherries to each 

00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:56.990
 most seedy tent itself 

00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:59.330
 zadrivannogo town could buy 

00:01:56.990 --> 00:02:01.790
 natural cherry juice jam or and 

00:01:59.330 --> 00:02:03.620
 cakes with cherries and most importantly 

00:02:01.790 --> 00:02:06.400
 heat treated ie during 

00:02:03.620 --> 00:02:09.619
 cooking berries and fruits completely 

00:02:06.400 --> 00:02:13.400
 lose their taste or change it to 

00:02:09.619 --> 00:02:16.189
 unrecognizable grandmother's main trouble 

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:19.480
 compote that it only boiling sugar 

00:02:16.189 --> 00:02:23.540
 water and berries and no chemistry at all 

00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:26.090
 so it tastes like shit so strawberries 

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:28.879
 rubbed with sugar and eaten right away 

00:02:26.090 --> 00:02:31.609
 tubers you still smell and harvested on 

00:02:28.879 --> 00:02:33.590
 five-minute winter from the same strawberry already 

00:02:31.609 --> 00:02:35.780
 no so manufacturers are forced 

00:02:33.590 --> 00:02:36.980
 add to pastries and other sweets 

00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:39.049
 flavors 

00:02:36.980 --> 00:02:41.629
 to firstly reduce consumption 

00:02:39.049 --> 00:02:42.769
 raw materials and secondly give the right and 

00:02:41.629 --> 00:02:45.379
 habitual taste 

00:02:42.769 --> 00:02:48.920
 All the more in this jelly already twenty seven 

00:02:45.379 --> 00:02:51.379
 percent of berries as for texture so 

00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:53.629
 the original does not give that rubberiness and 

00:02:51.379 --> 00:02:57.109
 which i like so much in gelatin 

00:02:53.629 --> 00:03:01.329
 jelly verdict is possible but cheap 

00:02:57.109 --> 00:03:01.329
 rubber jelly gives more buzz
