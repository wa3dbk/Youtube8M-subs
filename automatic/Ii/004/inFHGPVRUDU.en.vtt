00:00:11.219 --> 00:00:18.300

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:20.490

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:21.539
 I can not you, you know I can not do it 

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:23.400

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:25.260
 I just found out one more way 

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:26.970
 and reset w 

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:29.820
 I search on various websites 

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:32.210
 search multiple videos on youtube and 

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:34.160

00:00:32.210 --> 00:00:37.710
 procedure and called the lenovo 

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:41.610
 I tried 300 million procedures until 

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:44.309
 find this procedure on the site 

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:46.140
 American who ended up functioning more 

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:48.090
 This has nothing in Portuguese then. 

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:50.910
 a lot of people are lost 

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:53.190
 I'll give a quick idea for you to 

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:58.980
 how to reset the motherboard of the 

00:00:53.190 --> 00:01:02.100
 bios of lenovo x200 x220 is same and 

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:05.430
 I 'm ready with machines already assembled 

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:06.299
 I'll show you here where you are and 

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:09.479

 where are you going to do a reset and how 

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:13.350
 You're going to do that, so let 's 

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:15.570
 your machine is locked in this exact 

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:16.979
 Now you've dismantled the machine. 

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:19.380
 already opened the machine 

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:21.600
 the top of the machine you do not 

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:25.590
 need to remove the motherboard or keyboard 

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:30.210
 nothing and you have the motherboard 

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:36.630
 with the plate open let's go then this is 

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:40.759
 the x 200 users asked by the actor with the 

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:50.729
 board is unplugged from the outlet 

00:01:40.759 --> 00:01:52.770
 keyboard will open the hot keyboard 

00:01:50.729 --> 00:01:55.500

00:01:58.649 --> 00:02:03.630
 The battery is plugged. I understand. 

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:06.600
 I tried to leave the battery out of the 

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:08.879
 24- hour motherboard and try to connect 

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:13.200
