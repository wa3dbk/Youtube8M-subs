more<00:00:04.980> than<00:00:05.100> protecting<00:00:05.759> the<00:00:05.940> hair<00:00:08.059> the<00:00:09.059> hair

00:00:09.080 --> 00:00:09.090 
more than protecting the hair the hair

00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:15.799 
more than protecting the hair the hair
is<00:00:09.780> very<00:00:10.320> much<00:00:10.530> like<00:00:10.830> a<00:00:12.740> circuitry<00:00:13.740> and<00:00:14.809> when

00:00:15.799 --> 00:00:15.809 
is very much like a circuitry and when

00:00:15.809 --> 00:00:18.290 
is very much like a circuitry and when
in<00:00:16.410> a<00:00:16.560> circuitry<00:00:17.220> you<00:00:17.430> one<00:00:17.850> thing<00:00:18.060> you<00:00:18.180> don't

00:00:18.290 --> 00:00:18.300 
in a circuitry you one thing you don't

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:19.790 
in a circuitry you one thing you don't
want<00:00:18.420> to<00:00:18.570> have<00:00:18.720> in<00:00:18.930> all<00:00:19.050> of<00:00:19.170> the<00:00:19.260> equipment<00:00:19.529> we

00:00:19.790 --> 00:00:19.800 
want to have in all of the equipment we

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:21.529 
want to have in all of the equipment we
use<00:00:19.830> in<00:00:20.130> our<00:00:20.189> life<00:00:20.430> and<00:00:20.640> the<00:00:20.730> computers<00:00:21.270> and

the automobiles and all of that you know
the<00:00:24.359> circuits<00:00:24.869> have<00:00:24.930> to<00:00:25.230> be<00:00:25.380> really<00:00:25.619> clear

00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:25.830 
the circuits have to be really clear

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:28.189 
the circuits have to be really clear
when<00:00:26.010> the<00:00:26.099> wires<00:00:26.310> cross<00:00:26.730> you<00:00:27.720> get<00:00:27.900> short

00:00:28.189 --> 00:00:28.199 
when the wires cross you get short

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:30.400 
when the wires cross you get short
circuits<00:00:28.650> right<00:00:28.830> you<00:00:29.039> get<00:00:29.189> malfunctions

00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:30.410 
circuits right you get malfunctions

00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:33.920 
circuits right you get malfunctions
there's<00:00:31.410> subtle<00:00:31.710> malfunctions<00:00:32.750> it's<00:00:33.750> not

is<00:00:49.170> to<00:00:49.500> keep<00:00:49.739> the<00:00:50.010> hairs<00:00:50.480> from<00:00:51.480> tangling<00:00:52.050> from

00:00:52.459 --> 00:00:52.469 
is to keep the hairs from tangling from

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:57.680 
is to keep the hairs from tangling from
crossing<00:00:53.129> from<00:00:53.430> being<00:00:53.640> too<00:00:53.879> jumbled<00:00:54.420> and<00:00:56.690> that

is the way in which we're protecting the

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:05.870 
is the way in which we're protecting the
hair<00:01:02.780> oftentimes<00:01:03.780> in<00:01:04.019> India<00:01:04.350> you<00:01:04.530> see<00:01:04.769> men<00:01:05.670> and

00:01:29.929 --> 00:01:29.939 
today because of our lack of nutrition

00:01:29.939 --> 00:01:32.149 
today because of our lack of nutrition
in<00:01:30.060> the<00:01:30.180> soil<00:01:30.210> in<00:01:30.720> the<00:01:30.750> world<00:01:31.079> today<00:01:31.409> need<00:01:32.130> to

00:01:32.149 --> 00:01:32.159 
in the soil in the world today need to

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:35.300 
in the soil in the world today need to
take<00:01:32.460> supplements<00:01:33.380> just<00:01:34.380> because<00:01:34.799> we're<00:01:35.189> not

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:35.310 
take supplements just because we're not

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:38.649 
take supplements just because we're not
getting<00:01:35.820> the<00:01:35.970> supplements<00:01:36.570> out<00:01:36.750> of<00:01:36.990> the<00:01:37.340> food

00:01:38.649 --> 00:01:38.659 
getting the supplements out of the food

00:01:38.659 --> 00:01:41.780 
getting the supplements out of the food
but<00:01:39.659> we<00:01:39.810> need<00:01:40.290> to<00:01:40.619> we<00:01:40.950> need<00:01:40.979> to<00:01:41.189> do<00:01:41.520> the<00:01:41.759> things

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:41.790 
but we need to we need to do the things

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:45.770 
but we need to we need to do the things
that<00:01:42.329> will<00:01:42.720> give<00:01:42.990> us<00:01:43.170> that<00:01:43.500> vitamin<00:01:44.460> vitamin<00:01:45.270> D

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:45.780 
that will give us that vitamin vitamin D

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:48.830 
that will give us that vitamin vitamin D
now<00:01:46.399> it's<00:01:47.399> not<00:01:47.549> just<00:01:47.610> the<00:01:47.820> hair<00:01:48.090> that<00:01:48.329> absorbs

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:48.840 
now it's not just the hair that absorbs

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:51.710 
now it's not just the hair that absorbs
the<00:01:48.960> vitamin<00:01:49.320> D<00:01:49.439> the<00:01:49.590> skin<00:01:49.890> does<00:01:50.130> too<00:01:50.430> and<00:01:50.720> so

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:51.720 
the vitamin D the skin does too and so

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:53.510 
the vitamin D the skin does too and so
there's<00:01:51.930> a<00:01:51.990> actually<00:01:52.439> even<00:01:53.189> a<00:01:53.250> further

00:01:53.510 --> 00:01:53.520 
there's a actually even a further

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:58.300 
there's a actually even a further
problem<00:01:54.119> and<00:01:54.750> all<00:01:54.930> of<00:01:55.110> this<00:01:56.689> sunblock<00:01:57.689> is

00:01:58.300 --> 00:01:58.310 
problem and all of this sunblock is

00:01:58.310 --> 00:02:00.270 
problem and all of this sunblock is
blocking<00:01:59.310> vitamin<00:01:59.790> D

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:00.280 
blocking vitamin D

00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:02.850 
blocking vitamin D
goodbye<00:02:00.940> I<00:02:01.240> just<00:02:01.480> think<00:02:01.660> yeah<00:02:02.080> so<00:02:02.110> the<00:02:02.470> sub<00:02:02.710> has

goodbye I just think yeah so the sub has

00:02:02.860 --> 00:02:04.980 
goodbye I just think yeah so the sub has
gotten<00:02:03.190> a<00:02:03.250> really<00:02:03.400> bad<00:02:03.670> rap<00:02:03.780> reputation<00:02:04.780> over

00:02:04.980 --> 00:02:04.990 
gotten a really bad rap reputation over

00:02:04.990 --> 00:02:10.680 
gotten a really bad rap reputation over
the<00:02:05.080> last<00:02:05.460> few<00:02:06.460> years<00:02:06.850> and<00:02:08.850> so<00:02:09.850> vitamin<00:02:10.179> D<00:02:10.450> by

00:02:10.680 --> 00:02:10.690 
the last few years and so vitamin D by

00:02:10.690 --> 00:02:14.550 
the last few years and so vitamin D by
the<00:02:10.720> way<00:02:10.960> is<00:02:11.200> is<00:02:11.710> a<00:02:11.770> deficiency<00:02:13.170> all<00:02:14.170> around

00:02:14.550 --> 00:02:14.560 
the way is is a deficiency all around

00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:16.770 
the way is is a deficiency all around
the<00:02:14.680> world<00:02:15.060> because<00:02:16.060> so<00:02:16.090> many<00:02:16.330> people<00:02:16.450> are

protecting themselves from sunlight to
such<00:02:19.090> a<00:02:19.120> degree<00:02:19.890> but<00:02:20.890> yes<00:02:21.160> the<00:02:21.580> the<00:02:21.690> human<00:02:22.690> hair

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:23.050 
such a degree but yes the the human hair

00:02:23.050 --> 00:02:26.880 
such a degree but yes the the human hair
needs<00:02:23.470> to<00:02:23.620> have<00:02:23.890> contact<00:02:24.580> with<00:02:24.910> the<00:02:25.630> air<00:02:25.900> with
