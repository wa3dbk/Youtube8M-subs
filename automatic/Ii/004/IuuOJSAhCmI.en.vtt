00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:39.090 
ounces of dates and make sure they're

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:43.310 
ounces of dates and make sure they're
pitted<00:01:41.689> how<00:01:42.689> do<00:01:42.750> you<00:01:42.869> know<00:01:42.960> when<00:01:43.049> it's<00:01:43.170> ready

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:43.320 
pitted how do you know when it's ready

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:45.350 
pitted how do you know when it's ready
so<00:01:43.740> this<00:01:43.920> is<00:01:44.070> the<00:01:44.189> thing<00:01:44.340> this<00:01:44.490> is<00:01:44.700> a<00:01:44.729> textural

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:45.360 
so this is the thing this is a textural

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:47.319 
so this is the thing this is a textural
thing<00:01:45.390> so<00:01:45.720> what<00:01:45.869> we're<00:01:46.020> looking<00:01:46.320> for<00:01:46.350> now<00:01:46.799> is

00:01:47.319 --> 00:01:47.329 
thing so what we're looking for now is

00:01:47.329 --> 00:01:50.179 
thing so what we're looking for now is
that<00:01:48.329> it<00:01:48.450> sticks<00:01:48.659> together<00:01:48.869> like<00:01:49.799> this<00:01:49.979> and

00:01:50.179 --> 00:01:50.189 
that it sticks together like this and

00:01:50.189 --> 00:01:51.560 
that it sticks together like this and
then<00:01:50.280> we<00:01:50.399> know<00:01:50.549> we<00:01:50.670> have<00:01:50.700> enough<00:01:51.060> dates<00:01:51.270> if<00:01:51.450> it

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:51.570 
then we know we have enough dates if it

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:53.030 
then we know we have enough dates if it
didn't<00:01:51.869> then<00:01:52.079> i<00:01:52.200> would<00:01:52.320> add<00:01:52.439> a<00:01:52.470> few<00:01:52.649> more<00:01:52.710> dates

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:53.040 
didn't then i would add a few more dates

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:54.350 
didn't then i would add a few more dates
and<00:01:53.369> what<00:01:53.549> I<00:01:53.579> look<00:01:53.790> for<00:01:53.939> is<00:01:54.030> something<00:01:54.180> called

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:54.360 
and what I look for is something called

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:55.819 
and what I look for is something called
the<00:01:54.540> break<00:01:54.750> point<00:01:54.990> so<00:01:55.200> I<00:01:55.229> want<00:01:55.470> to<00:01:55.560> make<00:01:55.680> it

00:01:55.819 --> 00:01:55.829 
the break point so I want to make it

00:01:55.829 --> 00:01:57.380 
the break point so I want to make it
into<00:01:56.100> a<00:01:56.130> little<00:01:56.189> ball<00:01:56.490> but<00:01:57.030> I<00:01:57.090> want<00:01:57.240> to<00:01:57.270> make

00:01:57.380 --> 00:01:57.390 
into a little ball but I want to make

00:01:57.390 --> 00:01:59.149 
into a little ball but I want to make
sure<00:01:57.420> that<00:01:57.719> when<00:01:57.840> I<00:01:57.869> go<00:01:58.200> like<00:01:58.380> this<00:01:58.560> it<00:01:58.829> doesn't

00:01:59.149 --> 00:01:59.159 
sure that when I go like this it doesn't

00:01:59.159 --> 00:02:00.620 
sure that when I go like this it doesn't
crumble<00:01:59.340> so<00:01:59.549> this<00:01:59.700> is<00:01:59.820> perfect<00:02:00.030> I'm<00:02:00.420> going<00:02:00.570> to

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:00.630 
crumble so this is perfect I'm going to

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:02.690 
crumble so this is perfect I'm going to
a<00:02:00.659> little<00:02:00.930> vanilla<00:02:01.049> now<00:02:01.409> I<00:02:01.619> like<00:02:01.979> alcohol<00:02:02.460> free

00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:02.700 
a little vanilla now I like alcohol free

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:04.190 
a little vanilla now I like alcohol free
I<00:02:02.729> just<00:02:03.090> think<00:02:03.240> it<00:02:03.329> tastes<00:02:03.509> better<00:02:03.750> desert

00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:04.200 
I just think it tastes better desert

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:05.359 
I just think it tastes better desert
islands<00:02:04.500> that<00:02:04.680> are<00:02:04.710> right<00:02:04.890> instead<00:02:05.219> of<00:02:05.250> the

00:02:05.359 --> 00:02:05.369 
islands that are right instead of the

00:02:05.369 --> 00:02:07.580 
islands that are right instead of the
alcohol<00:02:05.520> but<00:02:06.180> only<00:02:06.479> add<00:02:06.600> your<00:02:06.780> vanilla<00:02:06.899> after

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:07.590 
alcohol but only add your vanilla after

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:09.710 
alcohol but only add your vanilla after
it's<00:02:08.069> at<00:02:08.520> the<00:02:08.700> point<00:02:08.879> you<00:02:09.030> like<00:02:09.209> the<00:02:09.360> texture

00:02:09.710 --> 00:02:09.720 
it's at the point you like the texture

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:10.919 
it's at the point you like the texture
so<00:02:10.530> now

00:02:10.919 --> 00:02:10.929 
so now

00:02:10.929 --> 00:02:13.110 
so now
the<00:02:10.989> filling<00:02:11.349> I<00:02:11.439> have<00:02:11.829> six<00:02:12.250> ounces<00:02:12.549> of<00:02:12.730> walnuts

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:13.120 
the filling I have six ounces of walnuts

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:15.240 
the filling I have six ounces of walnuts
and<00:02:13.450> so<00:02:14.170> this<00:02:14.290> is<00:02:14.439> where<00:02:14.680> we<00:02:14.799> get<00:02:14.920> our<00:02:14.980> good

00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:15.250 
and so this is where we get our good

00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:16.679 
and so this is where we get our good
fats<00:02:15.519> we<00:02:15.760> don't<00:02:15.939> need<00:02:16.090> to<00:02:16.150> use<00:02:16.269> butter<00:02:16.510> we

00:02:16.679 --> 00:02:16.689 
fats we don't need to use butter we

00:02:16.689 --> 00:02:18.750 
fats we don't need to use butter we
don't<00:02:16.870> need<00:02:17.019> to<00:02:17.079> use<00:02:17.500> cream<00:02:17.769> we<00:02:17.920> don't<00:02:18.519> need<00:02:18.670> to

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:18.760 
don't need to use cream we don't need to

00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:20.970 
don't need to use cream we don't need to
use<00:02:18.909> egg<00:02:19.060> so<00:02:19.239> now<00:02:19.659> when<00:02:20.079> I<00:02:20.109> made<00:02:20.409> the<00:02:20.439> crust<00:02:20.739> I

00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:20.980 
use egg so now when I made the crust I

00:02:20.980 --> 00:02:22.830 
use egg so now when I made the crust I
process<00:02:21.549> it<00:02:21.700> very<00:02:21.909> briefly<00:02:22.090> because<00:02:22.450> I<00:02:22.540> wanted

00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:22.840 
process it very briefly because I wanted

00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:24.660 
process it very briefly because I wanted
a<00:02:22.959> flower<00:02:23.170> like<00:02:23.319> consistency<00:02:23.769> but<00:02:24.400> for<00:02:24.549> this

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:24.670 
a flower like consistency but for this

00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:26.160 
a flower like consistency but for this
I'm<00:02:24.879> going<00:02:25.120> to<00:02:25.209> let<00:02:25.299> it<00:02:25.390> run<00:02:25.569> for<00:02:25.780> a<00:02:25.989> few

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:26.170 
I'm going to let it run for a few

00:02:26.170 --> 00:02:27.420 
I'm going to let it run for a few
minutes<00:02:26.319> I'm<00:02:26.560> actually<00:02:26.829> going<00:02:27.040> to<00:02:27.099> turn<00:02:27.280> this

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:27.430 
minutes I'm actually going to turn this

00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:29.369 
minutes I'm actually going to turn this
into<00:02:27.670> a<00:02:27.849> walnut<00:02:28.299> butter<00:02:28.510> you<00:02:28.900> can<00:02:29.170> buy<00:02:29.349> a

00:02:29.369 --> 00:02:29.379 
into a walnut butter you can buy a

00:02:29.379 --> 00:02:31.440 
into a walnut butter you can buy a
premade<00:02:29.769> walnut<00:02:30.159> butter<00:02:30.310> but<00:02:30.760> it's<00:02:30.909> much<00:02:31.090> less

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:31.450 
premade walnut butter but it's much less

00:02:31.450 --> 00:02:34.619 
premade walnut butter but it's much less
expensive<00:02:31.750> if<00:02:32.109> you<00:02:32.200> just<00:02:32.439> do<00:02:32.530> it<00:02:32.560> yourself<00:02:33.629> so

00:02:34.619 --> 00:02:34.629 
expensive if you just do it yourself so

00:02:34.629 --> 00:02:36.720 
expensive if you just do it yourself so
now<00:02:34.780> you<00:02:34.840> can<00:02:35.079> see<00:02:35.319> that<00:02:35.889> this<00:02:36.040> is<00:02:36.219> a<00:02:36.250> totally

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:36.730 
now you can see that this is a totally

00:02:36.730 --> 00:02:38.819 
now you can see that this is a totally
different<00:02:37.090> texture<00:02:37.540> than<00:02:37.569> the<00:02:37.900> crust<00:02:38.170> because

00:02:38.819 --> 00:02:38.829 
different texture than the crust because

00:02:38.829 --> 00:02:41.099 
different texture than the crust because
I<00:02:39.040> bring<00:02:39.219> me<00:02:39.370> into<00:02:39.670> an<00:02:39.879> a<00:02:40.030> creamy<00:02:40.450> nut<00:02:40.780> butter

00:02:41.099 --> 00:02:41.109 
I bring me into an a creamy nut butter

00:02:41.109 --> 00:02:43.589 
I bring me into an a creamy nut butter
without<00:02:41.469> any<00:02:41.769> added<00:02:42.099> oil<00:02:42.340> or<00:02:42.579> salt<00:02:42.849> so<00:02:43.389> now<00:02:43.510> I'm

00:02:43.589 --> 00:02:43.599 
without any added oil or salt so now I'm

00:02:43.599 --> 00:02:46.110

00:02:55.050 --> 00:02:55.060 
learning how to cook is that I know

00:02:55.060 --> 00:02:57.000 
learning how to cook is that I know
exactly<00:02:55.389> everything<00:02:56.019> that's<00:02:56.319> in<00:02:56.409> there<00:02:56.439> right

and you can go recognize exactly and

00:02:59.139 --> 00:03:00.479 
and you can go recognize exactly and
they're<00:02:59.260> words<00:02:59.469> that<00:02:59.620> a<00:02:59.739> fifth<00:02:59.950> grader<00:03:00.250> can
