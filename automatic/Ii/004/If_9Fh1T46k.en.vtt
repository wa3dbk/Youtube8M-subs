isolates by himself and it's my turn and

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:13.280 
isolates by himself and it's my turn and
they<00:01:10.890> activate<00:01:11.310> invite<00:01:11.790> fit<00:01:12.180> they<00:01:13.050> have<00:01:13.170> to

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:13.290 
they activate invite fit they have to

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:14.630 
they activate invite fit they have to
stay<00:01:13.470> within<00:01:13.619> three<00:01:13.860> inches<00:01:14.160> of<00:01:14.250> each<00:01:14.430> other

stay within three inches of each other

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:16.040 
stay within three inches of each other
but<00:01:15.090> they<00:01:15.210> don't<00:01:15.360> have<00:01:15.390> to<00:01:15.570> be<00:01:15.660> in<00:01:15.750> a<00:01:15.810> comp

00:01:16.040 --> 00:01:16.050 
but they don't have to be in a comp

00:01:16.050 --> 00:01:17.960 
but they don't have to be in a comp
right<00:01:16.890> I'll<00:01:17.010> just<00:01:17.100> take<00:01:17.190> a<00:01:17.310> daisy<00:01:17.520> chain<00:01:17.670> of

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:17.970 
right I'll just take a daisy chain of

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:20.120 
right I'll just take a daisy chain of
all<00:01:18.090> you<00:01:18.210> want<00:01:18.390> and<00:01:18.810> you<00:01:18.869> can<00:01:19.260> add<00:01:19.410> lots<00:01:19.680> on<00:01:19.979> the

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:20.130 
all you want and you can add lots on the

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:22.219 
all you want and you can add lots on the
past<00:01:20.399> point<00:01:20.700> so<00:01:20.880> this<00:01:21.119> is<00:01:21.240> a<00:01:21.270> balance<00:01:21.690> I<00:01:21.930> think

00:01:22.219 --> 00:01:22.229 
past point so this is a balance I think

00:01:22.229 --> 00:01:24.740 
past point so this is a balance I think
it's<00:01:22.380> like<00:01:22.530> 160<00:01:23.520> or<00:01:23.729> something<00:01:24.060> is<00:01:24.600> that

resolution is this very assignment based
we<00:02:58.700> do<00:02:58.880> a<00:02:58.910> lot<00:02:59.030> of<00:02:59.240> hacking<00:02:59.750> assignments<00:03:00.410> a<00:03:00.800> lot

00:03:01.420 --> 00:03:01.430 
we do a lot of hacking assignments a lot

00:03:01.430 --> 00:03:03.430 
we do a lot of hacking assignments a lot
of<00:03:01.550> get<00:03:01.730> in<00:03:01.910> get<00:03:02.120> out<00:03:02.180> as<00:03:02.480> much<00:03:02.660> as<00:03:03.050> fast<00:03:03.200> as<00:03:03.410> you

can type assignments
we<00:03:06.829> do

00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:07.930 
we do

00:03:07.930 --> 00:03:10.349 
we do
have<00:03:08.219> straight<00:03:09.219> up<00:03:09.250> firefights<00:03:09.790> you<00:03:10.239> know

00:03:10.359 --> 00:03:13.120 
have straight up firefights you know
where<00:03:10.569> it's<00:03:10.689> just<00:03:10.900> the<00:03:10.989> army<00:03:11.230> vs<00:03:11.530> army

00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:13.130 
where it's just the army vs army

00:03:13.130 --> 00:03:15.580 
where it's just the army vs army
and<00:03:13.450> even<00:03:14.450> in<00:03:14.600> a<00:03:14.690> larger<00:03:15.020> game<00:03:15.320> like<00:03:15.560> a

00:03:15.580 --> 00:03:15.590 
and even in a larger game like a

00:03:15.590 --> 00:03:18.100 
and even in a larger game like a
500-point<00:03:16.280> game<00:03:17.060> it's<00:03:17.330> the<00:03:17.510> only<00:03:17.750> about<00:03:17.870> ten

00:03:18.100 --> 00:03:18.110 
500-point game it's the only about ten

00:03:18.110 --> 00:03:24.460 
500-point game it's the only about ten
models

00:03:24.460 --> 00:03:24.470 

00:03:24.470 --> 00:03:26.990 

so<00:03:25.470> that's<00:03:25.980> that's<00:03:26.220> resolution<00:03:26.850> in<00:03:26.940> a

00:03:26.990 --> 00:03:27.000 
so that's that's resolution in a

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:29.090 
so that's that's resolution in a
nutshell<00:03:27.180> nice<00:03:27.690> it's<00:03:28.530> what<00:03:28.680> do<00:03:28.740> you<00:03:28.800> got<00:03:28.920> when

00:03:29.090 --> 00:03:29.100 
nutshell nice it's what do you got when

00:03:29.100 --> 00:03:31.820 
nutshell nice it's what do you got when
he<00:03:29.130> got<00:03:29.250> new<00:03:29.460> for<00:03:30.030> resolution<00:03:30.680> right<00:03:31.680> now

00:03:31.820 --> 00:03:31.830 
he got new for resolution right now

00:03:31.830 --> 00:03:36.750 
he got new for resolution right now
we're<00:03:32.010> showcasing

00:03:36.750 --> 00:03:36.760 

00:03:36.760 --> 00:03:39.070

00:03:43.520 --> 00:03:46.180 

that's<00:03:44.060> our<00:03:44.240> units<00:03:44.540> i<00:03:44.690> never<00:03:44.900> have<00:03:45.080> a<00:03:45.110> fun<00:03:45.380> time

00:03:46.180 --> 00:03:46.190 
that's our units i never have a fun time

00:03:46.190 --> 00:03:51.010 
that's our units i never have a fun time
