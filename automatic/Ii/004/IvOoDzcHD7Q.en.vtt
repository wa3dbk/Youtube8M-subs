00:01:24.179 --> 00:01:24.189 
make sure that the line is wound on

00:01:24.189 --> 00:01:26.310 
make sure that the line is wound on
under<00:01:24.520> tension<00:01:24.790> very<00:01:25.330> important<00:01:25.930> to<00:01:26.080> get<00:01:26.229> it

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:26.320 
under tension very important to get it

00:01:26.320 --> 00:01:28.050 
under tension very important to get it
on<00:01:26.409> there<00:01:26.590> nice<00:01:26.770> and<00:01:26.830> tight<00:01:27.100> not<00:01:27.430> winching<00:01:27.759> it

00:01:28.050 --> 00:01:28.060 
on there nice and tight not winching it

00:01:28.060 --> 00:01:30.749 
on there nice and tight not winching it
on<00:01:28.210> but<00:01:28.720> you'll<00:01:28.869> see<00:01:29.020> how<00:01:29.110> we<00:01:29.140> go<00:01:29.409> so<00:01:29.799> hold<00:01:30.610> the

00:01:30.749 --> 00:01:30.759 
on but you'll see how we go so hold the

00:01:30.759 --> 00:01:32.219 
on but you'll see how we go so hold the
rod<00:01:30.880> firmly<00:01:31.150> between<00:01:31.600> my<00:01:31.750> knees<00:01:31.930> like<00:01:31.960> that

00:01:33.899 --> 00:01:33.909 
and then we're just going to start

00:01:33.909 --> 00:01:36.330 
and then we're just going to start
winding<00:01:34.590> try<00:01:35.590> and<00:01:35.740> get<00:01:35.829> the<00:01:35.920> butt<00:01:36.100> ring

00:01:36.330 --> 00:01:36.340 
winding try and get the butt ring

00:01:36.340 --> 00:01:40.700 
winding try and get the butt ring
directly<00:01:36.820> over<00:01:37.090> the<00:01:37.180> spool<00:01:37.509> and<00:01:38.939> then<00:01:39.939> start

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:40.710 
directly over the spool and then start

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:45.539 
directly over the spool and then start
winding<00:01:41.710> the<00:01:42.040> line<00:01:42.189> on<00:01:42.430> like<00:01:42.640> that<00:01:42.909> now<00:01:44.490> how<00:01:45.490> do

00:01:45.539 --> 00:01:45.549 
winding the line on like that now how do

00:01:45.549 --> 00:01:47.819 
winding the line on like that now how do
you<00:01:45.759> know<00:01:45.880> the<00:01:46.030> lines<00:01:46.240> not<00:01:46.479> twisting<00:01:47.049> this<00:01:47.649> is

00:01:47.819 --> 00:01:47.829 
you know the lines not twisting this is

00:01:47.829 --> 00:01:49.920 
you know the lines not twisting this is
the<00:01:47.979> point<00:01:48.220> that<00:01:48.759> you<00:01:48.880> can<00:01:49.090> prevent<00:01:49.509> twists

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:49.930 
the point that you can prevent twists

00:01:49.930 --> 00:01:52.830 
the point that you can prevent twists
and<00:01:50.290> the<00:01:51.189> easiest<00:01:51.520> way<00:01:51.729> to<00:01:51.759> tell<00:01:52.180> is<00:01:52.450> if<00:01:52.689> you

00:01:52.830 --> 00:01:52.840 
and the easiest way to tell is if you

00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:54.719 
and the easiest way to tell is if you
can<00:01:53.020> see<00:01:53.229> there<00:01:53.470> the<00:01:53.619> line<00:01:53.860> is<00:01:54.100> coming<00:01:54.310> off<00:01:54.549> the

00:01:54.719 --> 00:01:54.729 
can see there the line is coming off the

00:01:54.729 --> 00:01:56.700 
can see there the line is coming off the
butt<00:01:54.939> ring<00:01:55.180> absolutely<00:01:55.590> perfectly<00:01:56.590> it's

00:01:56.700 --> 00:01:56.710 
butt ring absolutely perfectly it's

00:01:56.710 --> 00:01:58.710 
butt ring absolutely perfectly it's
running<00:01:56.979> through<00:01:57.189> my<00:01:57.340> fingers<00:01:57.759> over<00:01:57.939> the<00:01:58.509> lip

00:01:58.710 --> 00:01:58.720 
running through my fingers over the lip

00:01:58.720 --> 00:02:00.719 
running through my fingers over the lip
of<00:01:58.869> the<00:01:58.899> butt<00:01:59.170> ring<00:01:59.380> and<00:01:59.590> then<00:01:59.979> down<00:02:00.310> into<00:02:00.579> the

00:02:00.719 --> 00:02:00.729 
of the butt ring and then down into the

00:02:00.729 --> 00:02:02.399 
of the butt ring and then down into the
container<00:02:01.060> with<00:02:01.540> water<00:02:01.750> in<00:02:02.049> the<00:02:02.140> spool<00:02:02.380> of

00:02:02.399 --> 00:02:02.409 
container with water in the spool of

00:02:02.409 --> 00:02:04.830 
container with water in the spool of
line<00:02:02.710> the<00:02:03.399> line<00:02:03.579> was<00:02:03.790> twisted<00:02:04.270> it<00:02:04.509> would<00:02:04.659> twist

00:02:04.830 --> 00:02:04.840 
line the line was twisted it would twist

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:06.870 
line the line was twisted it would twist
once<00:02:05.229> or<00:02:05.439> twice<00:02:05.619> around<00:02:06.040> that<00:02:06.250> ring<00:02:06.460> so<00:02:06.700> when

00:02:06.870 --> 00:02:06.880 
once or twice around that ring so when

00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:09.300 
once or twice around that ring so when
you're<00:02:07.000> loading<00:02:07.450> stop<00:02:08.229> winding<00:02:08.470> after<00:02:08.979> a<00:02:09.009> few

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:09.310 
you're loading stop winding after a few

00:02:09.310 --> 00:02:11.340 
you're loading stop winding after a few
turns<00:02:09.610> and<00:02:09.820> check<00:02:10.479> to<00:02:10.750> see<00:02:10.780> whether<00:02:11.140> it's

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:11.350 
turns and check to see whether it's

00:02:11.350 --> 00:02:12.900 
turns and check to see whether it's
twisted<00:02:11.709> around<00:02:11.980> the<00:02:12.070> butt<00:02:12.250> ring<00:02:12.459> if<00:02:12.640> it<00:02:12.730> looks

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:12.910 
twisted around the butt ring if it looks

00:02:12.910 --> 00:02:15.210 
twisted around the butt ring if it looks
like<00:02:12.970> that<00:02:13.300> carry<00:02:13.690> on<00:02:13.870> if<00:02:14.080> it's<00:02:14.410> twisted<00:02:14.950> all

00:02:15.210 --> 00:02:15.220 
like that carry on if it's twisted all

00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:17.280 
like that carry on if it's twisted all
you<00:02:15.550> need<00:02:15.760> to<00:02:15.879> do<00:02:16.030> is<00:02:16.180> turn<00:02:16.390> the<00:02:16.599> spool<00:02:16.870> over

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:17.290 
you need to do is turn the spool over

00:02:17.290 --> 00:02:18.600 
you need to do is turn the spool over
the<00:02:17.410> other<00:02:17.560> way

00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:18.610 
the other way

00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:20.910 
the other way
Drina<00:02:18.910> line<00:02:19.150> is<00:02:19.360> spoiled<00:02:19.660> so<00:02:20.170> that<00:02:20.350> the<00:02:20.470> label

00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:20.920 
Drina line is spoiled so that the label

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:23.370 
Drina line is spoiled so that the label
side<00:02:21.190> the<00:02:21.550> uppermost<00:02:21.880> side<00:02:22.330> is<00:02:22.570> the<00:02:22.960> right<00:02:23.140> way

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:23.380 
side the uppermost side is the right way

00:02:23.380 --> 00:02:25.140 
side the uppermost side is the right way
to<00:02:23.440> load<00:02:23.800> it<00:02:24.040> but<00:02:24.430> if<00:02:24.520> you're<00:02:24.670> ever<00:02:24.760> loading

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:25.150 
to load it but if you're ever loading

00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:27.210 
to load it but if you're ever loading
any<00:02:25.240> kind<00:02:25.570> of<00:02:25.690> line<00:02:25.900> it's<00:02:26.170> a<00:02:26.320> good<00:02:26.560> general

00:02:27.210 --> 00:02:27.220 
any kind of line it's a good general

00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:28.560 
any kind of line it's a good general
rule<00:02:27.400> just<00:02:27.850> to<00:02:27.880> check<00:02:28.120> that<00:02:28.300> you're<00:02:28.420> not

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:28.570 
rule just to check that you're not

00:02:28.570 --> 00:02:30.600 
rule just to check that you're not
winding<00:02:28.780> twisted<00:02:29.320> line<00:02:29.500> onto<00:02:29.710> your<00:02:29.890> reel<00:02:30.070> so

00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:30.610 
winding twisted line onto your reel so

00:02:30.610 --> 00:02:32.160 
winding twisted line onto your reel so
we<00:02:30.730> can<00:02:30.850> see<00:02:31.000> that<00:02:31.150> it's<00:02:31.270> okay<00:02:31.570> so<00:02:31.930> we're<00:02:32.080> going

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:32.170 
we can see that it's okay so we're going

00:02:32.170 --> 00:02:35.190 
we can see that it's okay so we're going
to<00:02:32.230> carry<00:02:32.440> on<00:02:32.530> loading<00:02:33.210> now<00:02:34.210> to<00:02:34.270> make<00:02:34.600> the<00:02:34.810> the

00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:35.200 
to carry on loading now to make the the

00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:37.170 
to carry on loading now to make the the
job<00:02:35.410> of<00:02:35.560> loading<00:02:35.980> line<00:02:36.190> easier<00:02:36.760> and<00:02:36.880> to<00:02:36.970> take

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:37.180 
job of loading line easier and to take

00:02:37.180 --> 00:02:39.180 
job of loading line easier and to take
some<00:02:37.420> of<00:02:37.510> the<00:02:37.570> guesswork<00:02:37.900> out<00:02:38.040> what<00:02:39.040> we've

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:39.190 
some of the guesswork out what we've

00:02:39.190 --> 00:02:40.740 
some of the guesswork out what we've
done<00:02:39.370> there<00:02:39.670> it<00:02:39.790> is<00:02:39.910> there's<00:02:40.150> the<00:02:40.270> first<00:02:40.450> one

00:02:40.740 --> 00:02:40.750 
done there it is there's the first one

00:02:40.750 --> 00:02:43.710 
done there it is there's the first one
now<00:02:41.080> you<00:02:41.740> can<00:02:41.890> see<00:02:42.100> that<00:02:42.340> little<00:02:43.060> note<00:02:43.240> label

00:02:43.710 --> 00:02:43.720 
now you can see that little note label

00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:45.600 
now you can see that little note label
this<00:02:43.840> is<00:02:44.080> 750<00:02:45.070> meters

00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:45.610 
this is 750 meters

00:02:45.610 --> 00:02:47.100 
this is 750 meters
now<00:02:46.000> we've<00:02:46.150> got<00:02:46.240> three<00:02:46.420> labels<00:02:46.959> on<00:02:47.080> each

00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:47.110 
now we've got three labels on each

00:02:47.110 --> 00:02:49.530 
now we've got three labels on each
thousand<00:02:47.740> meter<00:02:47.920> spool<00:02:48.280> of<00:02:48.400> line<00:02:48.610> and<00:02:48.880> they're

00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:49.540 
thousand meter spool of line and they're

00:02:49.540 --> 00:02:52.110 
thousand meter spool of line and they're
placed<00:02:49.780> intermediately<00:02:50.590> at<00:02:50.800> 250<00:02:51.610> meters<00:02:51.940> so

00:02:52.110 --> 00:02:52.120 
placed intermediately at 250 meters so

00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:53.850 
placed intermediately at 250 meters so
that<00:02:52.150> you<00:02:52.420> know<00:02:52.600> how<00:02:52.840> much<00:02:53.020> line<00:02:53.260> is<00:02:53.440> left<00:02:53.680> on

00:02:53.850 --> 00:02:53.860 
that you know how much line is left on

00:02:53.860 --> 00:02:55.980 
that you know how much line is left on
that<00:02:54.040> spool<00:02:54.370> it's<00:02:54.550> not<00:02:54.730> guesswork<00:02:55.180> so<00:02:55.750> now<00:02:55.930> we

00:02:55.980 --> 00:02:55.990 
that spool it's not guesswork so now we

00:02:55.990 --> 00:02:58.170 
that spool it's not guesswork so now we
know<00:02:56.230> that's<00:02:56.410> there<00:02:56.650> 750<00:02:57.310> so<00:02:57.489> we've<00:02:57.640> got<00:02:57.790> 250

00:02:58.170 --> 00:02:58.180 
know that's there 750 so we've got 250

00:02:58.180 --> 00:03:00.150 
know that's there 750 so we've got 250
already<00:02:58.690> in<00:02:58.870> place<00:02:59.110> it's<00:02:59.709> going<00:02:59.890> to<00:02:59.950> take<00:03:00.130> a

00:03:00.150 --> 00:03:00.160 
already in place it's going to take a

00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:02.190 
already in place it's going to take a
little<00:03:00.459> bit<00:03:00.640> more<00:03:00.700> but<00:03:01.450> when<00:03:01.600> you<00:03:01.690> go<00:03:01.840> to<00:03:01.870> load

00:03:02.190 --> 00:03:02.200 
little bit more but when you go to load

00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:03.390 
little bit more but when you go to load
your<00:03:02.350> other<00:03:02.500> reels<00:03:02.800> you're<00:03:03.010> going<00:03:03.160> to<00:03:03.220> have<00:03:03.340> a

00:03:03.390 --> 00:03:03.400 
your other reels you're going to have a

00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:05.340 
your other reels you're going to have a
rough<00:03:03.640> idea<00:03:03.880> of<00:03:04.120> what<00:03:04.330> you've<00:03:04.510> got<00:03:04.720> left<00:03:04.989> so

00:03:05.340 --> 00:03:05.350 
rough idea of what you've got left so

00:03:05.350 --> 00:03:07.080 
rough idea of what you've got left so
you're<00:03:05.530> not<00:03:05.650> halfway<00:03:06.459> through<00:03:06.670> loading<00:03:07.030> a

00:03:07.080 --> 00:03:07.090 
you're not halfway through loading a

00:03:07.090 --> 00:03:08.520 
you're not halfway through loading a
spool<00:03:07.360> and<00:03:07.450> then<00:03:07.600> suddenly<00:03:07.810> running<00:03:08.230> out<00:03:08.350> of

00:03:08.520 --> 00:03:08.530 
spool and then suddenly running out of

00:03:08.530 --> 00:03:10.350 
spool and then suddenly running out of
line<00:03:08.709> so<00:03:09.400> I'm<00:03:09.459> gonna<00:03:09.550> pull<00:03:09.730> this<00:03:09.850> label<00:03:10.239> off

00:03:10.350 --> 00:03:10.360 
line so I'm gonna pull this label off

00:03:10.360 --> 00:03:14.760 
line so I'm gonna pull this label off
and<00:03:12.660> continue<00:03:13.660> loading<00:03:14.050> the<00:03:14.140> last<00:03:14.290> bit<00:03:14.590> now

00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:14.770 
and continue loading the last bit now

00:03:14.770 --> 00:03:17.940 
and continue loading the last bit now
we're<00:03:14.920> nearly<00:03:15.070> there<00:03:15.340> now<00:03:16.440> okay<00:03:17.440> so<00:03:17.500> when<00:03:17.830> you

00:03:17.940 --> 00:03:17.950 
we're nearly there now okay so when you

00:03:17.950 --> 00:03:19.650 
we're nearly there now okay so when you
finish<00:03:18.130> loading<00:03:18.430> your<00:03:18.730> line<00:03:18.910> it's<00:03:19.120> very<00:03:19.180> very

00:03:19.650 --> 00:03:19.660 
finish loading your line it's very very

00:03:19.660 --> 00:03:22.110 
finish loading your line it's very very
important<00:03:20.140> to<00:03:20.170> bed<00:03:20.440> it<00:03:20.590> in<00:03:20.739> properly<00:03:21.220> and<00:03:21.459> I<00:03:21.910> do

00:03:22.110 --> 00:03:22.120 
important to bed it in properly and I do

00:03:35.759 --> 00:03:35.769 
newly loaded spool of line you're going

00:03:35.769 --> 00:03:37.740 
newly loaded spool of line you're going
to<00:03:35.830> have<00:03:35.980> a<00:03:36.010> disaster<00:03:36.640> so<00:03:37.000> get<00:03:37.209> the<00:03:37.299> line<00:03:37.450> wet

00:03:37.740 --> 00:03:37.750 
to have a disaster so get the line wet

00:03:37.750 --> 00:03:39.420 
to have a disaster so get the line wet
get<00:03:38.049> the<00:03:38.170> tip<00:03:38.350> down<00:03:38.530> in<00:03:38.739> the<00:03:38.830> wall<00:03:38.980> to<00:03:39.190> get<00:03:39.340> the

00:03:39.420 --> 00:03:39.430 
get the tip down in the wall to get the

00:03:39.430 --> 00:03:41.370 
get the tip down in the wall to get the
line<00:03:39.610> nice<00:03:39.820> and<00:03:40.090> wet<00:03:40.269> and<00:03:40.630> get<00:03:40.810> it<00:03:40.930> wound<00:03:41.140> on

00:03:41.370 --> 00:03:41.380 
line nice and wet and get it wound on

00:03:41.380 --> 00:03:42.720 
line nice and wet and get it wound on
under<00:03:41.650> the<00:03:41.739> weight<00:03:41.920> of<00:03:41.950> the<00:03:42.160> lead<00:03:42.340> during

under the weight of the lead during

00:03:42.730 --> 00:03:44.729 
under the weight of the lead during
retrieval<00:03:43.299> and<00:03:43.420> then<00:03:43.840> the<00:03:43.989> line<00:03:44.140> is<00:03:44.320> ready<00:03:44.530> to

00:03:44.729 --> 00:03:44.739 
retrieval and then the line is ready to

00:03:44.739 --> 00:03:46.320 
retrieval and then the line is ready to
use<00:03:44.769> and<00:03:45.250> you'll<00:03:45.459> also<00:03:45.610> find<00:03:45.970> that<00:03:46.120> it<00:03:46.239> will

use and you'll also find that it will

00:03:46.330 --> 00:03:48.210 
use and you'll also find that it will
come<00:03:46.510> back<00:03:46.690> down<00:03:46.989> level<00:03:47.680> with<00:03:47.769> the<00:03:47.860> lip<00:03:48.010> of<00:03:48.130> the

00:03:48.210 --> 00:03:48.220 
come back down level with the lip of the

00:03:48.220 --> 00:03:50.699 
come back down level with the lip of the
spool<00:03:49.000> because<00:03:49.450> we<00:03:49.570> slightly<00:03:49.780> overloaded<00:03:50.590> it

00:03:50.699 --> 00:03:50.709 
spool because we slightly overloaded it
