00:00:05.009 --> 00:00:08.910

00:00:07.109 --> 00:00:10.740
 funk if you are watching the videos of alex and 

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:13.679
 capo and I said why not this video nobody 

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:16.560
 what I know nobody reads is an installation and 

00:00:13.679 --> 00:00:18.690
 so we will support ourselves 1.5 

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:20.940
 point 2 to enter is percentage 

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:23.010
 percentage appdata we are having the 

00:00:20.940 --> 00:00:25.170
 abdel market and without any other way 

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:28.619
 installed for now true 

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:31.950
 the 11th and if there were not then in the data 

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:37.890
 roaming point minecraft 

00:00:31.950 --> 00:00:39.120
 progress well when opening with winrar archiver 

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:41.410
 or any other program of your 

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:44.440
 preference and it can be 

00:00:41.410 --> 00:00:47.050
 because it is not said for example that many 

00:00:44.440 --> 00:00:49.090
 people use it now we open the funk 

00:00:47.050 --> 00:00:51.100
 I am still in anita forge 

00:00:49.090 --> 00:00:52.390
 pretty weird and good we copy all this 

00:00:51.100 --> 00:00:53.890
 from here simply because it's going to change 

00:00:52.390 --> 00:00:55.989
 what is the body all this here 

00:00:53.890 --> 00:00:57.879
 you obviously can not change is 

00:00:55.989 --> 00:01:01.269
 a fairly easy way not really from 

00:00:57.879 --> 00:01:03.810
 create because at least I was 

00:01:01.269 --> 00:01:08.480
 It makes it pretty easy d 

00:01:03.810 --> 00:01:11.460
 to make create the mod 

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:13.830
 so well then this is all the 

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:18.230
 installation we see it in the morro vivo to 

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:18.230
 then there are apologies and see you 

00:01:19.420 --> 00:01:23.110
 very good these guys here we are your 

00:01:21.250 --> 00:01:24.549
 fans and club I do not think there would be any 

00:01:23.110 --> 00:01:26.530
 problem in the installation so good 

00:01:24.549 --> 00:01:29.140
 here we are and place is a pretty 

00:01:26.530 --> 00:01:32.229
 good the fact of this here of how 

00:01:29.140 --> 00:01:35.110
 you see I really love it so 

00:01:32.229 --> 00:01:38.240
 now kibble compared that however what 

00:01:35.110 --> 00:01:40.340
 I understand here upstairs well in the version 

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:41.720
 down here come the creators who 

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:44.180
 give a movement that actually 

00:01:41.720 --> 00:01:46.700
 they should put an interface and so 

00:01:44.180 --> 00:01:48.799
 the language comes here 

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:51.130
 As you can see there is enough water 

00:01:48.799 --> 00:01:51.130
 to choose 

00:01:51.159 --> 00:01:56.930
 options new options texts 

00:01:54.159 --> 00:02:00.380
 packs and it's faster 

00:01:56.930 --> 00:02:02.360
 here is in the friends game to have 

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:04.640
 friends I need to face by law 

00:02:02.360 --> 00:02:06.260
 which is a way also to add 

00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:09.530
 friends 

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:12.380

00:02:09.530 --> 00:02:15.310
 here we have the player there is a server 

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:18.320
 edit the server direct connect adserver 

00:02:15.310 --> 00:02:20.300
 cancel fraser and very handsome actually 

00:02:18.320 --> 00:02:22.550
 I like that the background is seen and that 

00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:25.010
 add anything else a little connect 

00:02:22.550 --> 00:02:27.770
 we still do not know what works and connect 

00:02:25.010 --> 00:02:29.630
 without culture go to create another mode and 

00:02:27.770 --> 00:02:32.250
 here I have my and hardcore mod that is the 

00:02:29.630 --> 00:02:34.050
 new series that I'm going to create 

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:36.030
 an episode I feel like I'm going to record 

00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:39.060
 finishing this video so for that 

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:41.490
 have more continuous meditating to do 

00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:45.600
 contains what it does is that it returns us 

00:02:41.490 --> 00:02:47.700
 in our favor so it returns us to 

00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:49.320
 our initial world be the state 

00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:53.250
 playing before we return to that 

00:02:49.320 --> 00:02:56.610
 so this is francisco guys here 

00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:58.920
 They can continue by giving esq open 

00:02:56.610 --> 00:03:02.970
