00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:09.890 
could possibly open the vlog panting
slowly<00:00:07.259> backwards<00:00:07.910> to<00:00:08.910> reveal<00:00:09.210> a<00:00:09.480> cup<00:00:09.809> of

00:00:09.890 --> 00:00:09.900 
slowly backwards to reveal a cup of

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:13.100 
slowly backwards to reveal a cup of
coffee<00:00:10.490> which<00:00:11.490> is<00:00:11.639> a<00:00:11.670> very<00:00:12.000> strange<00:00:12.509> addition

coffee which is a very strange addition
to<00:00:13.259> raspberries<00:00:13.920> but<00:00:14.219> when<00:00:14.429> we<00:00:14.610> pull<00:00:14.849> back

00:00:14.870 --> 00:00:14.880 
to raspberries but when we pull back

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:19.220 
to raspberries but when we pull back
even<00:00:15.360> further<00:00:15.570> we<00:00:16.560> reveal<00:00:16.949> excite<00:00:17.960> which<00:00:18.960> then

00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:19.230 
even further we reveal excite which then

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:21.230 
even further we reveal excite which then
makes<00:00:19.439> the<00:00:19.650> coffee<00:00:19.830> make<00:00:20.220> a<00:00:20.250> lot<00:00:20.580> more<00:00:20.609> sense

00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:21.240
