00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:37.000 
the dial setting here for the power of

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:39.630 
the dial setting here for the power of
the<00:01:37.510> flesh<00:01:37.840> now<00:01:38.470> this<00:01:38.680> can<00:01:38.860> be<00:01:38.890> set<00:01:39.190> step

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:39.640 
the flesh now this can be set step

00:01:39.640 --> 00:01:42.360 
the flesh now this can be set step
lessly<00:01:40.030> between<00:01:40.720> full<00:01:41.110> power<00:01:41.380> and<00:01:41.680> right<00:01:42.280> the

this<00:02:18.130> is<00:02:18.250> the<00:02:18.310> way<00:02:18.400> I<00:02:18.430> like<00:02:18.730> to<00:02:18.850> do<00:02:18.940> things<00:02:19.120> if

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:19.270 
this is the way I like to do things if

00:02:19.270 --> 00:02:21.570 
this is the way I like to do things if
I'm<00:02:19.390> using<00:02:19.750> more<00:02:19.960> than<00:02:20.140> one<00:02:20.200> flash<00:02:20.710> hit<00:02:21.010> now

00:02:21.570 --> 00:02:21.580 
I'm using more than one flash hit now

00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:23.280 
I'm using more than one flash hit now
the<00:02:21.640> way<00:02:21.790> this<00:02:21.970> works<00:02:22.240> is<00:02:22.360> dead<00:02:22.390> easy<00:02:22.690> you<00:02:23.140> need

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:23.290 
the way this works is dead easy you need

00:02:23.290 --> 00:02:25.560 
the way this works is dead easy you need
another<00:02:23.560> flash<00:02:23.860> unit<00:02:24.250> when<00:02:24.670> that<00:02:24.970> flash<00:02:25.240> unit

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:25.570 
another flash unit when that flash unit

00:02:25.570 --> 00:02:28.200 
another flash unit when that flash unit
fires<00:02:25.780> this<00:02:26.530> flash<00:02:26.800> unit<00:02:27.130> will<00:02:27.250> trigger<00:02:27.640> when

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:28.210 
fires this flash unit will trigger when

00:02:28.210 --> 00:02:31.350 
fires this flash unit will trigger when
it<00:02:28.330> senses<00:02:28.660> the<00:02:29.080> flash<00:02:29.320> of<00:02:29.590> light<00:02:30.270> but<00:02:31.270> the

00:02:31.350 --> 00:02:31.360 
it senses the flash of light but the

00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:32.940 
it senses the flash of light but the
last<00:02:31.540> way<00:02:31.750> is<00:02:31.810> the<00:02:31.960> way<00:02:32.050> I<00:02:32.080> like<00:02:32.410> to<00:02:32.560> work<00:02:32.740> which

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:32.950 
last way is the way I like to work which

00:02:32.950 --> 00:02:35.760 
last way is the way I like to work which
is<00:02:32.980> again<00:02:33.490> using<00:02:33.760> the<00:02:34.120> sync<00:02:34.570> socket<00:02:35.140> here<00:02:35.410> but

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:35.770 
is again using the sync socket here but

00:02:35.770 --> 00:02:38.730 
is again using the sync socket here but
plugging<00:02:36.280> in<00:02:36.430> a<00:02:36.640> radio<00:02:37.270> trigger<00:02:37.840> that<00:02:38.500> means

00:02:38.730 --> 00:02:38.740 
plugging in a radio trigger that means

00:02:38.740 --> 00:02:40.200 
plugging in a radio trigger that means
you<00:02:38.860> have<00:02:38.980> a<00:02:39.010> radio<00:02:39.340> trigger<00:02:39.610> in<00:02:39.820> the<00:02:39.940> flash

00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:42.550 
you have a transceiver on the camera and

00:02:42.550 --> 00:02:45.240 
you have a transceiver on the camera and
when<00:02:42.910> you<00:02:43.030> fire<00:02:43.300> the<00:02:43.630> camera<00:02:43.990> the<00:02:44.590> signal<00:02:45.130> gets

00:02:45.240 --> 00:02:45.250 
when you fire the camera the signal gets

00:02:45.250 --> 00:02:46.710 
when you fire the camera the signal gets
sent<00:02:45.460> to<00:02:45.490> the<00:02:45.610> flash<00:02:45.820> and<00:02:46.060> fires<00:02:46.330> the<00:02:46.480> flash

00:02:46.710 --> 00:02:46.720 
sent to the flash and fires the flash

00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:48.330 
sent to the flash and fires the flash
the<00:02:47.140> beauty<00:02:47.650> of<00:02:47.680> that<00:02:47.830> is<00:02:47.890> there<00:02:48.220> are<00:02:48.310> no

00:02:48.330 --> 00:02:48.340 
the beauty of that is there are no

00:02:48.340 --> 00:02:50.520 
the beauty of that is there are no
cables<00:02:49.060> for<00:02:49.150> you<00:02:49.240> to<00:02:49.360> trip<00:02:49.540> over<00:02:49.660> making<00:02:50.290> your

00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:52.810 
working area a lot safer now you can get

00:02:52.810 --> 00:02:54.840 
working area a lot safer now you can get

sure<00:03:06.730> next<00:03:07.600> one<00:03:07.810> though<00:03:07.930> is<00:03:08.050> the<00:03:08.140> modeling

00:03:08.490 --> 00:03:08.500 
sure next one though is the modeling

00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:09.750 
sure next one though is the modeling
lamp<00:03:08.680> and<00:03:08.920> this<00:03:08.980> is<00:03:09.190> interesting<00:03:09.400> because<00:03:09.610> it

00:03:09.750 --> 00:03:09.760 
lamp and this is interesting because it

00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:12.180 
lamp and this is interesting because it
has<00:03:09.850> three<00:03:10.600> possible<00:03:10.780> settings<00:03:11.380> setting

00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:12.190 
has three possible settings setting

00:03:12.190 --> 00:03:14.250 
has three possible settings setting
number<00:03:12.430> one<00:03:12.670> is<00:03:12.910> where<00:03:13.120> I<00:03:13.150> keep<00:03:13.450> mine<00:03:13.780> most<00:03:14.050> of

00:03:14.250 --> 00:03:14.260 
number one is where I keep mine most of

00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:16.500 
number one is where I keep mine most of
the<00:03:14.350> time<00:03:14.560> that<00:03:15.250> is<00:03:15.490> where<00:03:15.880> the<00:03:16.060> modeling<00:03:16.330> lamp

00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:16.510 
the time that is where the modeling lamp

00:03:16.510 --> 00:03:19.260 
the time that is where the modeling lamp
is<00:03:16.720> turned<00:03:16.750> on<00:03:17.320> but<00:03:17.920> it's<00:03:18.070> in<00:03:18.280> a<00:03:18.430> variable

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:19.270 
is turned on but it's in a variable

00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:25.570 
the flash your modeling light will get

00:03:25.570 --> 00:03:27.810 
the flash your modeling light will get
brighter<00:03:25.840> and<00:03:26.200> darker<00:03:26.620> to<00:03:27.100> correspond<00:03:27.700> with

the flash output the next button along

00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:32.610 
the flash output the next button along
is<00:03:30.610> the<00:03:30.820> dim<00:03:31.150> switch<00:03:31.630> now<00:03:32.170> this<00:03:32.290> is<00:03:32.380> quite<00:03:32.530> a

00:03:32.610 --> 00:03:32.620 
is the dim switch now this is quite a

00:03:32.620 --> 00:03:34.830 
is the dim switch now this is quite a
useful<00:03:32.800> function<00:03:33.300> see<00:03:34.300> the<00:03:34.420> problem<00:03:34.660> is<00:03:34.720> this

00:03:34.830 --> 00:03:34.840 
useful function see the problem is this

00:03:34.840 --> 00:03:36.990 
useful function see the problem is this
when<00:03:35.290> you<00:03:35.380> take<00:03:35.530> a<00:03:35.560> picture<00:03:35.770> this<00:03:36.340> flash<00:03:36.670> unit

00:03:36.990 --> 00:03:37.000 
when you take a picture this flash unit

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:39.150 
when you take a picture this flash unit
has<00:03:37.180> to<00:03:37.360> recharge<00:03:38.050> before<00:03:38.620> it<00:03:38.830> gets<00:03:38.980> back<00:03:39.130> to

00:03:39.150 --> 00:03:39.160 
has to recharge before it gets back to

00:03:39.160 --> 00:03:40.770 
has to recharge before it gets back to
full<00:03:39.459> power<00:03:39.700> and<00:03:39.940> that<00:03:40.209> can<00:03:40.360> be<00:03:40.450> anything<00:03:40.660> from

00:03:40.770 --> 00:03:40.780 
full power and that can be anything from

00:03:40.780 --> 00:03:43.380 
full power and that can be anything from
half<00:03:41.230> a<00:03:41.410> second<00:03:41.770> to<00:03:42.100> one<00:03:42.430> and<00:03:42.580> a<00:03:42.610> half<00:03:42.790> seconds

00:03:43.380 --> 00:03:43.390 
half a second to one and a half seconds

00:03:43.390 --> 00:03:45.660 
half a second to one and a half seconds
now<00:03:43.840> that's<00:03:44.050> actually<00:03:44.350> very<00:03:44.680> very<00:03:45.010> fast<00:03:45.340> for<00:03:45.610> a

00:03:45.660 --> 00:03:45.670 
now that's actually very very fast for a

00:03:45.670 --> 00:03:48.210 
now that's actually very very fast for a
flash<00:03:46.000> unit<00:03:46.420> but<00:03:46.840> even<00:03:47.110> so<00:03:47.350> you<00:03:47.620> don't<00:03:48.040> want<00:03:48.160> to

00:03:48.210 --> 00:03:48.220 
flash unit but even so you don't want to

00:03:48.220 --> 00:03:50.010 
flash unit but even so you don't want to
be<00:03:48.280> taking<00:03:48.580> any<00:03:48.850> pictures<00:03:49.120> whilst<00:03:49.630> the<00:03:49.810> flash

00:03:50.010 --> 00:03:50.020 
be taking any pictures whilst the flash

00:03:50.020 --> 00:03:51.840 
be taking any pictures whilst the flash
units<00:03:50.350> recharging<00:03:50.980> otherwise<00:03:51.340> you<00:03:51.520> won't<00:03:51.670> get

00:03:51.840 --> 00:03:51.850 
units recharging otherwise you won't get

00:03:51.850 --> 00:03:54.120 
units recharging otherwise you won't get
the<00:03:51.970> full<00:03:52.000> brightness<00:03:52.630> of<00:03:52.780> light<00:03:52.860> well<00:03:53.860> if<00:03:54.040> you

00:03:54.120 --> 00:03:54.130 
the full brightness of light well if you

00:03:54.130 --> 00:03:56.160 
the full brightness of light well if you
have<00:03:54.280> the<00:03:54.370> dim<00:03:54.640> switch<00:03:54.970> turned<00:03:55.300> on<00:03:55.540> what<00:03:56.050> will

00:03:56.160 --> 00:03:56.170 
have the dim switch turned on what will

00:03:56.170 --> 00:03:58.560 
have the dim switch turned on what will
happen<00:03:56.500> is<00:03:56.650> whilst<00:03:57.250> the<00:03:57.430> flash<00:03:57.640> is<00:03:57.820> recharging

00:03:58.560 --> 00:03:58.570 
happen is whilst the flash is recharging

00:03:58.570 --> 00:04:01.020 
happen is whilst the flash is recharging
the<00:03:58.990> modeling<00:03:59.380> lamp<00:03:59.560> will<00:03:59.950> turn<00:04:00.190> off<00:04:00.370> so<00:04:00.910> if

00:04:01.020 --> 00:04:01.030 
the modeling lamp will turn off so if

00:04:01.030 --> 00:04:02.550 
the modeling lamp will turn off so if
you<00:04:01.120> can't<00:04:01.330> see<00:04:01.450> the<00:04:01.540> modeling<00:04:01.810> lamp<00:04:01.990> you<00:04:02.290> know

00:04:02.550 --> 00:04:02.560 
you can't see the modeling lamp you know

00:04:02.560 --> 00:04:04.740 
you can't see the modeling lamp you know
not<00:04:02.950> to<00:04:03.070> take<00:04:03.220> a<00:04:03.250> picture<00:04:03.570> now<00:04:04.570> there's

00:04:04.740 --> 00:04:04.750 
not to take a picture now there's

00:04:04.750 --> 00:04:06.030 
not to take a picture now there's
another<00:04:04.930> way<00:04:05.080> you<00:04:05.140> can<00:04:05.290> do<00:04:05.440> more<00:04:05.680> or<00:04:05.740> less<00:04:05.830> the

00:04:06.030 --> 00:04:06.040 
another way you can do more or less the

00:04:06.040 --> 00:04:07.710 
another way you can do more or less the
same<00:04:06.190> thing<00:04:06.520> and<00:04:06.760> that's<00:04:07.000> the<00:04:07.209> next<00:04:07.510> button

00:04:07.710 --> 00:04:07.720 
same thing and that's the next button

00:04:07.720 --> 00:04:10.170 
same thing and that's the next button
along<00:04:07.990> the<00:04:08.380> beeper<00:04:08.860> button<00:04:09.190> now<00:04:09.760> this<00:04:09.940> works

00:04:10.170 --> 00:04:10.180 
along the beeper button now this works

00:04:10.180 --> 00:04:12.750 
along the beeper button now this works
slightly<00:04:10.660> differently<00:04:11.190> this<00:04:12.190> works<00:04:12.430> by

00:04:12.750 --> 00:04:12.760 
slightly differently this works by

00:04:12.760 --> 00:04:15.449 
slightly differently this works by
giving<00:04:13.239> a<00:04:13.450> small<00:04:13.480> audio<00:04:14.260> beep<00:04:14.680> when<00:04:15.340> your

00:04:15.449 --> 00:04:15.459 
giving a small audio beep when your

00:04:15.459 --> 00:04:17.760 
giving a small audio beep when your
flash<00:04:15.670> has<00:04:15.940> fully<00:04:16.330> charged<00:04:16.840> up<00:04:17.080> so<00:04:17.560> when<00:04:17.680> you

00:04:17.760 --> 00:04:17.770 
flash has fully charged up so when you

00:04:17.770 --> 00:04:18.990 
flash has fully charged up so when you
hear<00:04:17.919> the<00:04:18.010> beep<00:04:18.160> you're<00:04:18.520> ready<00:04:18.700> to<00:04:18.850> take

00:04:18.990 --> 00:04:19.000 
hear the beep you're ready to take

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:20.849 
hear the beep you're ready to take
another<00:04:19.239> picture<00:04:19.450> now<00:04:20.260> you<00:04:20.320> can<00:04:20.560> use<00:04:20.680> the

00:04:20.849 --> 00:04:20.859 
another picture now you can use the

00:04:20.859 --> 00:04:23.070 
another picture now you can use the
beeper<00:04:21.250> and<00:04:21.370> the<00:04:21.850> dim<00:04:22.060> switch<00:04:22.450> together<00:04:22.870> so

00:04:23.070 --> 00:04:23.080 
beeper and the dim switch together so

00:04:23.080 --> 00:04:24.570 
beeper and the dim switch together so
you<00:04:23.169> can<00:04:23.260> have<00:04:23.350> them<00:04:23.470> both<00:04:23.620> turned<00:04:23.979> on<00:04:24.160> you<00:04:24.550> can

00:04:24.570 --> 00:04:24.580 
you can have them both turned on you can

00:04:24.580 --> 00:04:26.790 
you can have them both turned on you can
have<00:04:24.790> one<00:04:25.120> or<00:04:25.390> the<00:04:25.840> other<00:04:25.990> turned<00:04:26.380> on

00:04:26.790 --> 00:04:26.800 
have one or the other turned on

00:04:26.800 --> 00:04:28.320 
have one or the other turned on
or<00:04:27.039> you<00:04:27.129> have<00:04:27.250> them<00:04:27.340> both<00:04:27.520> turned<00:04:27.849> off<00:04:28.030> if<00:04:28.210> you

00:04:28.320 --> 00:04:28.330 
or you have them both turned off if you

00:04:28.330 --> 00:04:29.670 
or you have them both turned off if you
wish<00:04:28.539> there's<00:04:28.990> plenty<00:04:29.259> of<00:04:29.289> things<00:04:29.410> you<00:04:29.560> can

00:04:29.670 --> 00:04:29.680 
wish there's plenty of things you can

00:04:29.680 --> 00:04:32.550 
wish there's plenty of things you can
customize<00:04:30.190> on<00:04:30.430> the<00:04:30.520> back<00:04:30.669> of<00:04:30.849> the<00:04:30.910> flash<00:04:31.560> final

00:04:32.550 --> 00:04:32.560 
customize on the back of the flash final

00:04:32.560 --> 00:04:35.100 
customize on the back of the flash final
button<00:04:32.800> is<00:04:33.039> the<00:04:33.430> flash<00:04:33.970> test<00:04:34.330> button<00:04:34.569> press

00:04:35.100 --> 00:04:35.110 
button is the flash test button press

00:04:35.110 --> 00:04:38.040 
button is the flash test button press
that<00:04:35.289> and<00:04:35.500> it'll<00:04:35.710> fire<00:04:36.009> the<00:04:36.340> flash<00:04:36.580> hit<00:04:37.050> okay

00:04:38.040 --> 00:04:38.050 
that and it'll fire the flash hit okay

00:04:38.050 --> 00:04:39.360 
that and it'll fire the flash hit okay
so<00:04:38.110> that's<00:04:38.349> the<00:04:38.470> basic<00:04:38.500> buttons<00:04:39.039> you've<00:04:39.190> got

00:04:39.360 --> 00:04:39.370 
so that's the basic buttons you've got

00:04:39.370 --> 00:04:40.589 
so that's the basic buttons you've got
there<00:04:39.550> let's<00:04:39.940> have<00:04:40.000> a<00:04:40.120> look<00:04:40.210> at<00:04:40.300> some<00:04:40.449> of<00:04:40.539> the

00:04:40.589 --> 00:04:40.599 
there let's have a look at some of the

00:04:40.599 --> 00:04:41.969 
there let's have a look at some of the
attachments<00:04:41.110> you<00:04:41.199> can<00:04:41.229> put<00:04:41.440> on<00:04:41.530> the<00:04:41.650> front<00:04:41.830> of

00:04:41.969 --> 00:04:41.979 
attachments you can put on the front of

00:04:41.979 --> 00:04:45.180 
attachments you can put on the front of
the<00:04:42.039> flash<00:04:42.250> head<00:04:43.560> so<00:04:44.560> just<00:04:44.590> below<00:04:45.039> the

00:04:45.180 --> 00:04:45.190 
the flash head so just below the

00:04:45.190 --> 00:04:47.760 
the flash head so just below the
reflector<00:04:45.669> is<00:04:45.819> a<00:04:45.849> small<00:04:46.270> slot<00:04:46.840> and<00:04:47.169> that's

00:04:47.760 --> 00:04:47.770 
reflector is a small slot and that's

00:04:47.770 --> 00:04:49.469 
reflector is a small slot and that's
there<00:04:48.009> to<00:04:48.129> allow<00:04:48.310> you<00:04:48.370> to<00:04:48.550> attach<00:04:48.879> things<00:04:49.240> like
