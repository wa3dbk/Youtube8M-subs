a pretty good cake the the coloring when
it<00:01:19.570> broke<00:01:19.750> i<00:01:19.960> thought<00:01:20.140> the<00:01:20.259> the<00:01:20.590> blue<00:01:20.770> was

00:01:20.910 --> 00:01:20.920

00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:23.910 
it broke i thought the the blue was
really<00:01:21.190> bright<00:01:21.399> the<00:01:22.119> actual<00:01:22.450> reports<00:01:23.020> they

00:01:23.910 --> 00:01:23.920 
really bright the actual reports they

00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:25.499 
really bright the actual reports they
were<00:01:23.979> pretty<00:01:24.130> good<00:01:24.369> as<00:01:24.490> well<00:01:24.520> hopefully<00:01:25.000> both

00:01:25.499 --> 00:01:25.509 
were pretty good as well hopefully both

00:01:25.509 --> 00:01:27.810
