 car 

00:00:22.270 --> 00:00:29.160
 Gin seeks to ensure that the metal's is the mall 

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:37.250
 The metal ball is now heated enough for experimental gas 

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:46.030
 The metal ball of the pane will not pass through the large metal 

00:00:50.829 --> 00:00:57.179
 Then cool the metal ball thoroughly with water 

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:06.379
 The metal ball after healing passes through the large metal one again 

00:01:09.220 --> 00:01:18.930
 Metal ball you can see that the volume expands upon heating is increased by this thing 

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:25.729
 Guin's request does not go through small metal's 

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:35.749
 The temperature is sufficiently heated with a small gas stove on a laboratory gas stove 

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:42.910
 Metal balls pass through small metal after heating 

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:55.060
 The next smaller metal is chilled enough with water 

00:01:56.340 --> 00:02:03.469
 Metal balls do not freeze small metal after cooling 

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:16.960
 You can see that the hole increases in inflation to mother heating of smaller metal to Ono 

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:31.110
 Check if the weight of the heated and expanded metal ball changes 

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:37.790
 Anetsu the weight of the front of the metal ball and measure only spring 

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:37.790
 The metal ball is now heated enough for experimental gas 

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:45.880
 The weight of the metal ball and measure only spring after Ane' 

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:57.049
 You can see that the metal does not change in weight when heated and expanded
