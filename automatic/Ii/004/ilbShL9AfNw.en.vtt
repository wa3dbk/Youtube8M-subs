00:00:00.639 --> 00:00:03.639
 kouemaha 

00:00:04.540 --> 00:00:07.540
 hahahahahaha 

00:00:08.279 --> 00:00:11.169
 wouters 

00:00:11.169 --> 00:00:13.829
 the researchers are so happy that you are watching 

00:00:13.829 --> 00:00:16.999
 the proceeds very welcome a super ten are being scooped out 

00:00:16.999 --> 00:00:20.410
 markelo but thanks for this in delft, today is becoming very healthy again 

00:00:20.410 --> 00:00:22.699
 movie because that is about sound 

00:00:22.699 --> 00:00:26.949
 and what I often hear we see on the doing can fall is that people with 

00:00:26.949 --> 00:00:30.189
 a usury policy concluded how often they are very difficult to understand 

00:00:30.189 --> 00:00:34.399
 maybe that rightly recognizes that you just have to give some tips to 

00:00:34.399 --> 00:00:35.070
 look 

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:38.860
 whether we are wonderful to hear what is walking afterwards or you might like the sound 

00:00:38.860 --> 00:00:43.300
 from the microphone of petercam at the bottom of the video you can see on the left as yes 

00:00:43.300 --> 00:00:46.410
 you click on it very fresh from the right but you can sort of 

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:50.260
 two buy the sound card that you connect via a free music decort 

00:00:50.260 --> 00:00:53.830
 only then the advantage of there are very many people who connect the microphone 

00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:57.350
 the prince montjuich by means of a melted jacket 

00:00:57.350 --> 00:01:01.150
 it's a pretty tricky thing to actually become a very small club 

00:01:01.150 --> 00:01:02.330
 connect 

00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:05.550
 directly into your PC in the sound card that counts as standard with your PC 

00:01:06.110 --> 00:01:10.710
 after that, gross smolt jack is connected at the time that you do this 

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:14.120
 record sound without being thought out you also record the sound on one 

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:17.790
 the fans that also run on your motherboard so say the 

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:21.960
 fan running on your processor since then that sound no longer on 

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:24.900
 And then you need some kind of wolves or some kind of eclipse 

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:29.540
 yes you buy after such a book the link polder is much to give criticism 

00:01:29.540 --> 00:01:32.840
 to look but the court was nothing at all it is gentlemen free 

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:34.040
 simple 

00:01:34.040 --> 00:01:37.660
 to close the sleeve booklet but then let your cooperation 

00:01:37.660 --> 00:01:39.690
 So put your microphone on it 

00:01:39.690 --> 00:01:44.280
 this way you prevent the sound of the annual meeting 

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:47.740
 process video card fans the area is also on the ribbon 

00:01:48.430 --> 00:01:49.920
 if you can do it safely 

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:53.909
 the written drive click through to the right, some noise peaks ran like this 

00:01:53.909 --> 00:01:57.540
 travel around the world speaker excuse right mouse button on the future a lot 

00:01:57.540 --> 00:01:58.820
 devices 

00:01:58.820 --> 00:02:01.590
 bad news for the fans of the here 

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:05.910
 four times i got it so it was blood he did 7 in church with right on you 

00:02:05.910 --> 00:02:07.450
 microphone we are going to win 

00:02:07.450 --> 00:02:08.709
 properties 

00:02:08.709 --> 00:02:10.559
 how do you go to levels 

00:02:10.559 --> 00:02:13.639
 six of them drew the microphone in hand 

00:02:14.939 --> 00:02:19.469
 9 out of 10 times you have to work by hand is the fourth time his vision 

00:02:19.469 --> 00:02:22.659
 restarted bye you won't do that again 

00:02:22.659 --> 00:02:26.599
 this amplifies the sound that they caught on alleged friend Jimmy 

00:02:28.579 --> 00:02:33.409
 yes the more there is not to add this is it so I can not 

00:02:33.409 --> 00:02:37.150
 make more of it so this time it is a very short instruction but one that 

00:02:37.150 --> 00:02:39.810
 but actually many people have asked for how do you get the 

00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:40.810
 noise barrier 

00:02:40.810 --> 00:02:44.540
 he succeeded outside of the fact that I managed to get a note which is really a very good one 

00:02:44.540 --> 00:02:46.599
 microphone is 

00:02:46.599 --> 00:02:50.239
 yes I always did this with a headset and a compliment 

00:02:50.239 --> 00:02:51.949
 weeks out of five 

00:02:51.949 --> 00:02:55.789
 in my previous headset the rider of skil series and diesel can be viewed via 

00:02:55.789 --> 00:02:57.859
 a melted jacket 

00:02:57.859 --> 00:03:02.709
 a port somewhere along with the number 3 victory according to the bus I have you myself 

00:03:02.709 --> 00:03:06.549
 also very nice but yes with the problems of police chief how do I get 

00:03:06.549 --> 00:03:10.150
 well sound a lot better and therefore other brinkhuis found that out 

00:03:10.149 --> 00:03:13.419
 so that includes the sound of your motherboard and takagi the series 

00:03:13.419 --> 00:03:14.099
 from son 

00:03:14.099 --> 00:03:17.650
 it also on twitter blog that block and then my sound was for sure 80 to 

00:03:17.650 --> 00:03:22.279
 90 percent a lot but really a whole lot better so I hope 

00:03:22.279 --> 00:03:25.279
 that yes until my chickens can help you with this 

00:03:25.999 --> 00:03:28.929
 let you know what you think I am very curious about your reactions and I 

00:03:28.929 --> 00:03:32.529
 wish you every success the next time a few hours of cloth that
