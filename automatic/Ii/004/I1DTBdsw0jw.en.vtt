00:00:00.470 --> 00:00:18.390
 We have prepared a 9-week program to become a 3-program program. 

00:00:08.100 --> 00:00:19.710
 The program consists of four blocks of Kyushu from one week to three weeks 4 to 6 weeks 7 

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:23.890
 I will 

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:32.650
 The content is different for each block 

00:00:23.890 --> 00:00:36.500
 For example, one week accustomed to training program 4 to 6 weeks a recent topic 

00:00:32.650 --> 00:00:44.090
 It's like doing a training method 

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:52.680
 What kind of item in the program and in what order and how often it is performed weekly 

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:55.740
 It has easy-to-understand explanations sprinkled person in your points or notes of the form of various eye 

00:00:52.680 --> 00:01:01.490
 Here is an example of parrot introduction 

00:00:55.740 --> 00:01:07.770
 Introducing Tri-Sep Extension which makes your arms thicker 

00:01:01.490 --> 00:01:10.799
 When I ask for a thick arm, I imagine a bicep with a bicep 

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:13.510
 Biceps are difficult to train 

00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:20.110
 It is hard to get fat 

00:01:13.510 --> 00:01:26.890
 In contrast to the biceps, the triceps brachii on the back of the arm 

00:01:20.110 --> 00:01:32.190
 More muscle mass and easier to develop than biceps 

00:01:26.890 --> 00:01:36.640
 Train your upper triceps and aim for a thicker arm 

00:01:32.190 --> 00:01:41.860
 Train arm muscles triceps 

00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:45.620
 Sleep on the floor and perform Lambert Lycep Extension 

00:01:41.860 --> 00:01:47.740
 Prepare a dumbbell next to one body 

00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:54.080
 Please sleep on the floor 

00:01:47.740 --> 00:01:56.590
 When you lie on the floor, bend both feet and put your feet firmly on the floor 

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:59.020
 Take the right hand as an example 

00:01:56.590 --> 00:02:00.840
 Holding a dumbbell in his right hand 

00:01:59.020 --> 00:02:07.030
 Bending arms 

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:11.420
 Please hold the dumbbell so that the elbow comes on the forehead 

00:02:07.030 --> 00:02:19.350
 Stretch your arms slowly while exhaling 

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:20.500
 If the elbow is 90% extended, hold the arm for 1 second and breathe slowly while bending your arm 

00:02:19.350 --> 00:02:25.960
 important point 

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:29.700
 Do not move the position of the elbow during movement 

00:02:25.960 --> 00:02:29.700
 I will do my best 

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:57.510
 It seems like you are taking a private lesson at home as you explain various eyes in detail like this 

00:02:52.030 --> 00:02:57.510
 I can do training in the sense
