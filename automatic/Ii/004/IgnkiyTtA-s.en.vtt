it's<00:02:07.380> even<00:02:07.740> fatter<00:02:07.979> than<00:02:08.190> the<00:02:08.250> touch<00:02:08.459> pro2

which is a bulky phone on its own accord
it's<00:02:12.420> not<00:02:12.660> the<00:02:12.810> heaviest<00:02:13.110> phone

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:13.620 
it's not the heaviest phone

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:15.050 
it's not the heaviest phone
and<00:02:13.739> in<00:02:13.830> my<00:02:13.950> hands<00:02:14.159> but<00:02:14.400> it's<00:02:14.610> definitely<00:02:14.940> not

00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:15.060 
and in my hands but it's definitely not

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:16.970 
and in my hands but it's definitely not
a<00:02:15.120> featherweight<00:02:15.599> and<00:02:15.720> why<00:02:16.260> the<00:02:16.319> phone<00:02:16.620> is<00:02:16.799> fat

00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:16.980 
a featherweight and why the phone is fat

00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:18.649 
a featherweight and why the phone is fat
and<00:02:17.159> heavy<00:02:17.310> I'm<00:02:17.640> pretty<00:02:18.000> sure<00:02:18.150> this<00:02:18.360> is<00:02:18.599> the

00:02:18.649 --> 00:02:18.659 
and heavy I'm pretty sure this is the

00:02:18.659 --> 00:02:21.410 
and heavy I'm pretty sure this is the
reason<00:02:19.110> the<00:02:19.769> n900<00:02:20.220> has<00:02:20.730> a<00:02:20.760> three<00:02:21.030> row<00:02:21.180> QWERTY

00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:21.420 
reason the n900 has a three row QWERTY

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:23.210 
reason the n900 has a three row QWERTY
keyboard<00:02:21.810> that<00:02:21.959> pops<00:02:22.140> out<00:02:22.290> with<00:02:22.470> a<00:02:22.500> bang<00:02:22.709> the

00:02:23.210 --> 00:02:23.220 
keyboard that pops out with a bang the

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:25.250 
keyboard that pops out with a bang the
mechanism<00:02:23.730> itself<00:02:23.819> is<00:02:24.180> very<00:02:24.450> solid<00:02:24.780> but<00:02:25.140> it

00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:25.260 
mechanism itself is very solid but it

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:26.899 
mechanism itself is very solid but it
leaves<00:02:25.470> very<00:02:25.590> little<00:02:26.040> space<00:02:26.220> for<00:02:26.459> the<00:02:26.519> actual

00:02:26.899 --> 00:02:26.909 
leaves very little space for the actual

00:02:26.909 --> 00:02:28.970 
leaves very little space for the actual
keys<00:02:27.180> there's<00:02:27.599> only<00:02:27.870> three<00:02:28.200> rows<00:02:28.379> of<00:02:28.409> keys<00:02:28.709> so

00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:28.980 
keys there's only three rows of keys so

00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:30.740 
keys there's only three rows of keys so
no<00:02:29.190> dedicated<00:02:29.370> row<00:02:29.790> of<00:02:29.909> keys<00:02:30.090> for<00:02:30.299> the<00:02:30.390> numbers

00:02:30.740 --> 00:02:30.750 
no dedicated row of keys for the numbers

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:32.569 
no dedicated row of keys for the numbers
which<00:02:31.230> is<00:02:31.409> a<00:02:31.440> slight<00:02:31.769> disappointment

00:02:32.569 --> 00:02:32.579 
which is a slight disappointment

00:02:32.579 --> 00:02:34.670 
which is a slight disappointment
luckily<00:02:33.030> the<00:02:33.329> keys<00:02:33.510> do<00:02:33.780> have<00:02:33.959> a<00:02:33.989> nice<00:02:34.260> feel<00:02:34.500> to

00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:34.680 
luckily the keys do have a nice feel to

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:35.960 
luckily the keys do have a nice feel to
them<00:02:34.799> they're<00:02:35.069> nice<00:02:35.250> and<00:02:35.459> raised<00:02:35.700> and

00:02:35.960 --> 00:02:35.970 
them they're nice and raised and

00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:37.789 
them they're nice and raised and
pressing<00:02:36.299> the<00:02:36.390> keys<00:02:36.569> has<00:02:36.750> a<00:02:36.780> nice<00:02:36.959> feedback<00:02:37.200> so

00:02:37.789 --> 00:02:37.799 
pressing the keys has a nice feedback so

00:02:37.799 --> 00:02:39.559 
pressing the keys has a nice feedback so
it<00:02:38.069> is<00:02:38.190> a<00:02:38.220> nice<00:02:38.459> keypad<00:02:38.970> but<00:02:39.180> I<00:02:39.209> would<00:02:39.480> have

00:02:39.559 --> 00:02:39.569 
it is a nice keypad but I would have

00:02:39.569 --> 00:02:40.850 
it is a nice keypad but I would have
liked<00:02:39.690> to<00:02:39.720> seem<00:02:40.019> some<00:02:40.230> more<00:02:40.409> space<00:02:40.680> between

00:02:40.850 --> 00:02:40.860 
liked to seem some more space between

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:43.460 
liked to seem some more space between
the<00:02:41.159> keys<00:02:41.370> and<00:02:41.610> the<00:02:42.239> edges<00:02:42.569> because<00:02:42.720> with<00:02:43.200> fat

00:02:43.460 --> 00:02:43.470 
the keys and the edges because with fat

the keys and the edges because with fat
thumbs<00:02:43.860> like<00:02:43.950> mine<00:02:44.310> it<00:02:44.489> all<00:02:44.610> feels<00:02:44.879> a<00:02:45.030> bit

not as well built as the hd2 I reviewed

00:03:34.859 --> 00:03:36.860 
not as well built as the hd2 I reviewed
last<00:03:35.040> week<00:03:35.370> but<00:03:35.910> I<00:03:35.940> would<00:03:36.239> say<00:03:36.419> that<00:03:36.569> the<00:03:36.660> build

00:03:36.860 --> 00:03:36.870 
last week but I would say that the build

00:03:36.870 --> 00:03:38.330 
last week but I would say that the build
quality<00:03:37.079> is<00:03:37.379> pretty<00:03:37.620> much<00:03:37.739> similar<00:03:38.099> to<00:03:38.129> the

quality is pretty much similar to the

00:03:38.340 --> 00:03:40.759 
quality is pretty much similar to the
touch<00:03:38.549> pro2<00:03:38.700> so<00:03:39.690> I'd<00:03:39.840> say<00:03:40.049> build<00:03:40.290> quality<00:03:40.500> is

00:03:40.759 --> 00:03:40.769 
touch pro2 so I'd say build quality is

00:03:40.769 --> 00:03:44.539 
touch pro2 so I'd say build quality is

widgets on one pane and contacts on

00:05:51.900 --> 00:05:53.960 
widgets on one pane and contacts on
another<00:05:52.200> it's<00:05:52.830> simple<00:05:53.160> enough<00:05:53.250> but<00:05:53.580> I<00:05:53.610> have<00:05:53.820> to

00:05:53.960 --> 00:05:53.970 
another it's simple enough but I have to

00:05:53.970 --> 00:05:55.340 
another it's simple enough but I have to
mention<00:05:54.150> that<00:05:54.390> the<00:05:54.510> shortcuts<00:05:54.960> are<00:05:55.080> a<00:05:55.140> bit

00:05:55.340 --> 00:05:55.350 
mention that the shortcuts are a bit

00:05:55.350 --> 00:05:56.720 
mention that the shortcuts are a bit
small<00:05:55.680> for<00:05:55.710> dragging<00:05:56.190> around<00:05:56.280> with<00:05:56.610> your

00:05:56.720 --> 00:05:56.730 
small for dragging around with your

small for dragging around with your
finger<00:05:57.090> I<00:05:57.210> sometimes<00:05:57.900> ended<00:05:58.470> up<00:05:58.590> holding<00:05:58.800> the

00:05:59.000 --> 00:05:59.010 
finger I sometimes ended up holding the

00:05:59.010 --> 00:06:01.159

note<00:06:23.820> about<00:06:23.850> the<00:06:24.240> n900<00:06:24.570> is<00:06:25.020> the<00:06:25.290> fact<00:06:25.530> that

00:06:25.670 --> 00:06:25.680 
note about the n900 is the fact that

00:06:25.680 --> 00:06:28.580 
note about the n900 is the fact that
it's<00:06:26.160> a<00:06:26.280> landscape<00:06:26.610> only<00:06:26.910> device<00:06:27.590> meaning

00:06:28.580 --> 00:06:28.590 
it's a landscape only device meaning

00:06:28.590 --> 00:06:30.440 
it's a landscape only device meaning
there's<00:06:29.040> no<00:06:29.130> portrait<00:06:29.700> mode<00:06:29.850> for<00:06:30.090> the<00:06:30.180> device

there's no portrait mode for the device

there's no portrait mode for the device
so<00:06:31.020> if<00:06:31.200> you<00:06:31.320> rotate<00:06:31.680> the<00:06:31.710> device<00:06:31.950> into<00:06:32.310> a

00:06:32.360 --> 00:06:32.370 
so if you rotate the device into a

00:06:32.370 --> 00:06:34.190 
so if you rotate the device into a
vertical<00:06:32.730> position<00:06:32.880> don't<00:06:33.660> expect<00:06:34.080> the

vertical position don't expect the
