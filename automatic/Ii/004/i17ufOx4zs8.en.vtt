00:00:01.370 --> 00:00:06.140
 Greetings today we will solve an error 

00:00:03.710 --> 00:00:07.900
 mathematical in a certain chapter of the 

00:00:06.140 --> 00:00:10.210
 simpson 

00:00:07.900 --> 00:00:12.190
 in that chapter homero simpson 

00:00:10.210 --> 00:00:15.549
 Find some lenses inside a 

00:00:12.190 --> 00:00:17.950
 toilet puts them on and says the following 

00:00:15.549 --> 00:00:19.869
 the sum of the square roots of two 

00:00:17.950 --> 00:00:23.820
 sides of an isosceles triangle is equal 

00:00:19.869 --> 00:00:23.820
 to the square root of remaining side 

00:00:23.940 --> 00:00:28.770
 immediately after supposedly 

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:31.140
 corrected by a guy who is in the 

00:00:28.770 --> 00:00:33.750
 toilet alluding to the triangle 

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:37.040
 equilateral instead of the triangle 

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:41.240
 isosceles as I had said before 

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:44.270
 as we see on the screen these are a 

00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:48.950
 equilateral triangle and a triangle 

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:51.370
 isosceles colorful from left to right 

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:55.270
 the equilateral is characterized by having 

00:00:51.370 --> 00:00:58.610
 many will know all its equal sides 

00:00:55.270 --> 00:01:01.880
 while the isosceles is characterized 

00:00:58.610 --> 00:01:05.760
 for having only two equal sides and for 

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:09.480
 both a different in magnitude 

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:12.750
 we change the equilateral we change the 

00:01:09.480 --> 00:01:15.030
 equilateral word for isosceles in the 

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:17.220
 phrase of homero simpson according to the 

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:20.490
 supposed correction of the type that is in 

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:22.200
 the toilet and we have the sum of the 

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:25.050
 square roots of two sides of a 

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:29.290
 equilateral triangle is equal to the root 

00:01:25.050 --> 00:01:32.230
 square of the radius of the remaining side 

00:01:29.290 --> 00:01:33.610
 if we replace the values ​​in two of the 

00:01:32.230 --> 00:01:36.310
 legs are sides of the triangle 

00:01:33.610 --> 00:01:39.940
 equilateral we can get the value of 

00:01:36.310 --> 00:01:41.740
 his third side knowing then that the 

00:01:39.940 --> 00:01:45.040
 three equal the three sides should be 

00:01:41.740 --> 00:01:47.090
 same in this case we use the 

00:01:45.040 --> 00:01:50.600
 number four 

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:55.200
 for both legs and we do the 

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:59.539
 respective operations and will give us 

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:59.539
 that is the same 

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:06.340
 4 squared 

00:02:02.140 --> 00:02:09.819
 this is equal to equal to 16 so without 

00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:14.140
 have we have that is equal to 4 and the side 

00:02:09.819 --> 00:02:16.750
 b is equal to 4 but it gave us that 12 is 

00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:19.240
 equal to 16 the condition for a 

00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:21.959
 triangle is alky but is that all 

00:02:19.240 --> 00:02:27.120
 its sides are the same as we well know 

00:02:21.959 --> 00:02:27.120
 that is to equals ab equals ac 

00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:32.140
 as we see the above does not meet the 

00:02:29.349 --> 00:02:33.730
 condition of the equilateral triangle by 

00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:36.010
 such a motive the type that is in one 

00:02:33.730 --> 00:02:38.040
 truly is 

00:02:36.010 --> 00:02:41.209
 and target and ando 

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:43.920
 final notes the Pythagorean theorem 

00:02:41.209 --> 00:02:45.480
 it tells us that in every triangle 

00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:48.689
 rectangle the square of the hypotenuse 

00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:50.720
 is equal to the sum of the squares of 

00:02:48.689 --> 00:02:53.060
 the legs 

00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:55.640
 this theorem is correctly signaled 

00:02:53.060 --> 00:02:58.940
 both in the translation of this chapter 

00:02:55.640 --> 00:03:00.470
 of the Simpsons in Spanish from Spain 

00:02:58.940 --> 00:03:02.780
 The original English of the United States 

00:03:00.470 --> 00:03:05.270
 just confusing the kind of 

00:03:02.780 --> 00:03:07.190
 triangle by German grouper so 

00:03:05.270 --> 00:03:09.710
 intentional in the dialogue to make it 

00:03:07.190 --> 00:03:11.600
 obviously a comedy is to say instead 

00:03:09.710 --> 00:03:14.030
 to say rectangle homero says 

00:03:11.600 --> 00:03:17.580
 isosceles and is corrected immediately 

00:03:14.030 --> 00:03:20.700
 by the guy who is in the toilet 

00:03:17.580 --> 00:03:24.170
 instead in the audio made by 

00:03:20.700 --> 00:03:27.720
 mexico usually called Latin audio 

00:03:24.170 --> 00:03:31.680
 homero mentions a theorem similar to 

00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:35.040
 of Pythagoras which is precisely what 

00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:38.430
 the one that we analyzed in this video and 

00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:42.300
 is badly corrected by way of such irony 

00:03:38.430 --> 00:03:44.070
 again by the toilet guy another 

00:03:42.300 --> 00:03:46.580
 interesting feature of the 

00:03:44.070 --> 00:03:50.310
 differences between different audios 

00:03:46.580 --> 00:03:53.340
 in this chapter is that in Spain they omit 

00:03:50.310 --> 00:03:56.040
 the idiot word which is in the 

00:03:53.340 --> 00:03:57.590
 original audio in English and in the audio 

00:03:56.040 --> 00:04:00.110
 Mexican 

00:03:57.590 --> 00:04:02.720
 Finally it should be noted that in that 

00:04:00.110 --> 00:04:08.620
 then the voice actor of the audio 

00:04:02.720 --> 00:04:08.620
 mexican was the talented humberto best
