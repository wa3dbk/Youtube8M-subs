 Hi guys 

00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:12.269
 I'll show you now how 

00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:15.089
 use the right thermo-vinyl 

00:00:12.269 --> 00:00:17.880
 is the vinyl that we use in fabric 

00:00:15.089 --> 00:00:19.710
 First I cut into mine. 

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:21.150
 clicking which you can use by clicking 

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:25.109
 help at 

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:30.900
 That's right, the image I wanted to 

00:00:25.109 --> 00:00:35.579
 mirror shape is obeying 

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:38.280
 blade pressure specification 

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:43.160
 It 's important to see how new it is. 

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:47.010
 do not cut that plastic coming behind you 

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:50.090
 that show you're seeing has this 

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:52.320
 plastic and even vinyl that will stick on the 

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:55.739
 in the fabric 

00:00:52.320 --> 00:01:04.039
 Okay, so I cut the image and I'm going to take it. 

00:00:55.739 --> 00:01:04.039
 now the rest of the vinyl 

00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:54.679
 so stay put if you notice that you did not cut 

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:56.509
 Plastic cut only vinyl tanak 

00:01:54.679 --> 00:01:59.630
 field usually we use the pressure 

00:01:56.509 --> 00:02:01.970
 two number two 

00:01:59.630 --> 00:02:04.280
 That's what I 'm going to do. 

00:02:01.970 --> 00:02:07.479
 mirrored because it will stay when I 

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:09.580
 put on the shirt will stay the way 

00:02:07.479 --> 00:02:17.150
 correct 

00:02:09.580 --> 00:02:25.989
 Okay, I'll put it on the shirt. 

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:25.989
 where I want to apply get hot iron 

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:37.980
 and put on top by not pressing 

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:42.360
 may be scraping too much for the 

00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:45.830
 plastic does not leave the place other than vinyl 

00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:45.830
 It will be very good, Radu. 

00:03:16.450 --> 00:03:20.439
 It has to get hot, okay? 

00:03:30.830 --> 00:03:39.750
 and then take the plastic if you see that 

00:03:37.200 --> 00:03:42.470
 did not leave fully warms up one more 

00:03:39.750 --> 00:03:42.470
 little 

00:03:56.820 --> 00:04:07.210
 I did not take the plastic was the vinyl already 

00:04:02.230 --> 00:04:10.900
 patterned on the fabric is really cool you 

00:04:07.210 --> 00:04:13.180
 you can use the images you want 

00:04:10.900 --> 00:04:15.190

00:04:13.180 --> 00:04:18.150
