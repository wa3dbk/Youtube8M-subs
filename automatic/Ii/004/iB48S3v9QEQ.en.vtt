00:00:22.450 --> 00:00:22.460 
3d printed parts on the bench today I

00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:24.400 
3d printed parts on the bench today I
have<00:00:22.910> some<00:00:23.060> more<00:00:23.150> detail<00:00:23.630> parts<00:00:24.050> which<00:00:24.260> are

00:00:24.400 --> 00:00:24.410 
have some more detail parts which are

00:00:24.410 --> 00:00:27.160 
have some more detail parts which are
for<00:00:24.530> the<00:00:24.560> rib<00:00:24.830> sections<00:00:25.370> and<00:00:25.760> a<00:00:26.180> another<00:00:26.930> piece

00:00:27.160 --> 00:00:27.170 
for the rib sections and a another piece

00:00:27.170 --> 00:00:28.690 
for the rib sections and a another piece
for<00:00:27.410> the<00:00:27.500> middle<00:00:27.800> all<00:00:27.980> of<00:00:28.130> these<00:00:28.250> are<00:00:28.400> 3d

00:00:28.690 --> 00:00:28.700 
for the middle all of these are 3d

00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:32.380 
for the middle all of these are 3d
printed<00:00:28.730> and<00:00:29.210> sprayed<00:00:29.690> Chrome<00:00:30.230> I<00:00:31.059> also<00:00:32.059> have

00:00:32.380 --> 00:00:32.390 
printed and sprayed Chrome I also have

00:00:32.390 --> 00:00:34.600 
printed and sprayed Chrome I also have
these<00:00:33.290> pieces<00:00:33.649> so<00:00:33.980> I've<00:00:34.129> got<00:00:34.309> one<00:00:34.430> of<00:00:34.520> these

00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:34.610 
these pieces so I've got one of these

00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:36.490 
these pieces so I've got one of these
already<00:00:34.790> fitted<00:00:35.210> to<00:00:35.329> the<00:00:35.420> suit<00:00:35.660> this<00:00:36.260> is<00:00:36.379> in

00:00:36.490 --> 00:00:36.500 
already fitted to the suit this is in

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:38.640 
already fitted to the suit this is in
fact<00:00:36.800> a<00:00:36.980> hook<00:00:37.190> to<00:00:37.399> hold<00:00:37.579> the<00:00:37.730> shoulder<00:00:37.940> fell<00:00:38.300> on

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:38.650 
fact a hook to hold the shoulder fell on

00:00:38.650 --> 00:00:42.270 
fact a hook to hold the shoulder fell on
so<00:00:39.650> that's<00:00:40.340> thick<00:00:40.579> Sonic<00:00:40.880> that<00:00:41.090> that<00:00:41.750> angle

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:42.280 
so that's thick Sonic that that angle

00:00:42.280 --> 00:00:46.420 
so that's thick Sonic that that angle
and<00:00:43.280> basically<00:00:44.380> this<00:00:45.380> magnet<00:00:45.890> here<00:00:46.070> grips

00:00:46.420 --> 00:00:46.430 
and basically this magnet here grips

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:49.300 
and basically this magnet here grips
another<00:00:47.300> magnet<00:00:47.750> inside<00:00:48.260> so<00:00:48.950> that<00:00:48.980> these

00:00:49.300 --> 00:00:49.310 
another magnet inside so that these

00:00:49.310 --> 00:00:52.540 
another magnet inside so that these
pieces<00:00:50.350> sort<00:00:51.350> of<00:00:51.470> snap<00:00:51.680> together<00:00:51.980> and<00:00:52.370> that

00:00:52.540 --> 00:00:52.550 
pieces sort of snap together and that

00:00:52.550 --> 00:00:53.740 
pieces sort of snap together and that
holds<00:00:52.790> the<00:00:52.910> shoulder<00:00:53.270> belt<00:00:53.360> on<00:00:53.510> pretty<00:00:53.720> well

00:00:53.740 --> 00:00:53.750 
holds the shoulder belt on pretty well

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:54.910 
holds the shoulder belt on pretty well
and<00:00:54.020> I'll<00:00:54.079> show<00:00:54.260> you<00:00:54.290> the<00:00:54.440> one<00:00:54.590> I<00:00:54.620> fitted

00:00:54.910 --> 00:00:54.920 
and I'll show you the one I fitted

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:57.460 
and I'll show you the one I fitted
surely<00:00:55.570> the<00:00:56.570> other<00:00:56.630> two<00:00:56.870> pieces<00:00:57.079> of<00:00:57.260> these

00:00:57.460 --> 00:00:57.470 
surely the other two pieces of these

00:00:57.470 --> 00:01:00.460 
surely the other two pieces of these
hooks<00:00:57.850> which<00:00:58.850> hold<00:00:59.149> the<00:00:59.270> ab<00:00:59.480> plate<00:00:59.840> onto<00:01:00.140> a

00:01:00.460 --> 00:01:00.470 
hooks which hold the ab plate onto a

00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:03.190 
hooks which hold the ab plate onto a
bungee<00:01:01.010> cord<00:01:01.040> which<00:01:01.550> I<00:01:02.059> briefly<00:01:02.690> mentioned<00:01:02.870> in

00:01:03.190 --> 00:01:03.200 
bungee cord which I briefly mentioned in

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:05.259 
bungee cord which I briefly mentioned in
the<00:01:03.260> last<00:01:03.410> video<00:01:03.759> I've<00:01:04.759> got<00:01:04.969> hold<00:01:05.089> of<00:01:05.119> this

00:01:05.259 --> 00:01:05.269 
the last video I've got hold of this

00:01:05.269 --> 00:01:07.899 
the last video I've got hold of this
silver<00:01:05.630> bungee<00:01:05.990> cord<00:01:06.229> which<00:01:06.500> is<00:01:06.680> roughly<00:01:07.490> 10

00:01:07.899 --> 00:01:07.909 
silver bungee cord which is roughly 10

00:01:07.909 --> 00:01:11.740 
silver bungee cord which is roughly 10
million<00:01:08.149> diameter<00:01:08.869> and<00:01:10.030> that<00:01:11.030> snaps<00:01:11.390> on<00:01:11.540> there

00:01:11.740 --> 00:01:11.750 
million diameter and that snaps on there

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:17.110 
million diameter and that snaps on there
quite<00:01:11.930> nicely<00:01:12.760> so<00:01:15.159> that<00:01:16.159> will<00:01:16.370> hold<00:01:16.850> the<00:01:17.000> AB

00:01:17.110 --> 00:01:17.120 
quite nicely so that will hold the AB

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:20.350 
quite nicely so that will hold the AB
plate<00:01:17.390> which<00:01:17.659> I'll<00:01:17.840> show<00:01:17.990> you<00:01:18.049> now<00:01:19.180> so<00:01:20.180> there's

00:01:20.350 --> 00:01:20.360 
plate which I'll show you now so there's

00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:21.940 
plate which I'll show you now so there's
my<00:01:20.510> piece<00:01:20.690> of<00:01:20.840> bungee<00:01:21.170> cord<00:01:21.380> which<00:01:21.590> I<00:01:21.740> fitted

00:01:21.940 --> 00:01:21.950 
my piece of bungee cord which I fitted

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:24.340 
my piece of bungee cord which I fitted
to<00:01:22.159> these<00:01:22.340> two<00:01:22.640> brackets<00:01:22.940> in<00:01:23.780> the<00:01:23.840> last<00:01:24.049> video

00:01:24.340 --> 00:01:24.350 
to these two brackets in the last video

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:26.260 
to these two brackets in the last video
so<00:01:25.220> that's<00:01:25.430> just<00:01:25.610> put<00:01:25.820> through<00:01:25.970> there's<00:01:26.180> a

00:01:26.260 --> 00:01:26.270 
so that's just put through there's a

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:27.969 
so that's just put through there's a
cable<00:01:26.630> tie<00:01:26.810> on<00:01:26.869> each<00:01:27.020> end<00:01:27.260> to<00:01:27.320> hold<00:01:27.560> it<00:01:27.770> and

00:01:27.969 --> 00:01:27.979 
cable tie on each end to hold it and

00:01:27.979 --> 00:01:30.070 
cable tie on each end to hold it and
then<00:01:28.790> the<00:01:29.030> pieces<00:01:29.210> I<00:01:29.420> just<00:01:29.450> showed<00:01:29.780> you<00:01:29.810> these

00:01:30.070 --> 00:01:30.080 
then the pieces I just showed you these

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:35.820 
then the pieces I just showed you these
hooks<00:01:30.409> just<00:01:30.799> sort<00:01:31.340> of<00:01:31.400> snap<00:01:31.670> on<00:01:31.820> there<00:01:32.740> we<00:01:33.740> go

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:35.830 
hooks just sort of snap on there we go

00:01:35.830 --> 00:01:39.760 
hooks just sort of snap on there we go
and<00:01:36.830> that<00:01:37.630> will<00:01:38.630> hold<00:01:38.810> the<00:01:39.080> add<00:01:39.260> plate<00:01:39.560> so

00:01:39.760 --> 00:01:39.770 
and that will hold the add plate so

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:41.890 
and that will hold the add plate so
they'll<00:01:39.890> be<00:01:40.010> glued<00:01:40.310> to<00:01:40.460> the<00:01:40.580> top<00:01:40.790> there<00:01:41.090> and

00:01:41.890 --> 00:01:41.900 
they'll be glued to the top there and

00:01:41.900 --> 00:01:43.570 
they'll be glued to the top there and
that<00:01:42.170> means<00:01:42.260> that's<00:01:42.439> got<00:01:42.680> some<00:01:42.890> flexibility

00:01:43.570 --> 00:01:43.580 
that means that's got some flexibility

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:45.760 
that means that's got some flexibility
but<00:01:43.850> ultimately<00:01:44.240> it's<00:01:44.390> supported<00:01:44.930> can<00:01:45.650> also

00:01:45.760 --> 00:01:45.770 
but ultimately it's supported can also

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:47.890 
but ultimately it's supported can also
twist<00:01:46.159> slightly<00:01:46.700> as<00:01:46.790> well<00:01:47.000> so<00:01:47.659> it's<00:01:47.750> thinking

00:01:47.890 --> 00:01:47.900 
twist slightly as well so it's thinking

00:01:47.900 --> 00:01:49.300 
twist slightly as well so it's thinking
this<00:01:48.080> is<00:01:48.229> quite<00:01:48.409> a<00:01:48.439> good<00:01:48.619> method<00:01:48.830> of<00:01:49.009> actually

00:01:49.300 --> 00:01:49.310 
this is quite a good method of actually

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:50.679 
this is quite a good method of actually
attaching<00:01:49.729> costume<00:01:50.119> pieces<00:01:50.540> together

00:01:50.679 --> 00:01:50.689 
attaching costume pieces together

00:01:50.689 --> 00:01:54.760 
attaching costume pieces together
perhaps<00:01:51.680> for<00:01:51.979> ankle<00:01:52.369> joints<00:01:52.850> or<00:01:53.259> wrist<00:01:54.259> joints

00:01:54.760 --> 00:01:54.770 
perhaps for ankle joints or wrist joints

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:57.359 
perhaps for ankle joints or wrist joints
potentially<00:01:55.430> elbows<00:01:55.880> and<00:01:56.119> shoulders

00:01:57.359 --> 00:01:57.369 
potentially elbows and shoulders

00:01:57.369 --> 00:01:59.830 
potentially elbows and shoulders
possibly<00:01:58.369> fireman<00:01:58.880> suits<00:01:59.150> or<00:01:59.299> other<00:01:59.450> types<00:01:59.689> of

00:01:59.830 --> 00:01:59.840 
possibly fireman suits or other types of

00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:01.120 
possibly fireman suits or other types of
costumes<00:02:00.290> so<00:02:00.439> something<00:02:00.710> I'm<00:02:00.799> going<00:02:00.890> to<00:02:00.979> use

00:02:01.120 --> 00:02:01.130 
costumes so something I'm going to use

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:02.920 
costumes so something I'm going to use
in<00:02:01.280> the<00:02:01.369> future<00:02:01.520> for<00:02:01.970> some<00:02:02.180> other<00:02:02.360> projects

00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:02.930 
in the future for some other projects

00:02:02.930 --> 00:02:05.469 
in the future for some other projects
basically<00:02:03.740> bungee<00:02:04.340> cord<00:02:04.579> and<00:02:04.909> bits<00:02:05.090> of<00:02:05.240> hooks

00:02:05.469 --> 00:02:05.479 
basically bungee cord and bits of hooks

00:02:05.479 --> 00:02:07.630 
basically bungee cord and bits of hooks
so<00:02:06.170> obviously<00:02:06.439> those<00:02:06.619> unhook<00:02:07.130> so<00:02:07.340> you<00:02:07.400> can

00:02:07.630 --> 00:02:07.640 
so obviously those unhook so you can

00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:10.240 
so obviously those unhook so you can
separate<00:02:08.000> the<00:02:08.149> pieces<00:02:08.329> and<00:02:08.979> they<00:02:09.979> give<00:02:10.159> you

00:02:10.240 --> 00:02:10.250 
separate the pieces and they give you

00:02:10.250 --> 00:02:11.979 
separate the pieces and they give you
some<00:02:10.429> flexibility<00:02:11.030> when<00:02:11.299> they're<00:02:11.450> together

00:02:11.979 --> 00:02:11.989 
some flexibility when they're together

00:02:11.989 --> 00:02:13.809 
some flexibility when they're together
so<00:02:12.590> let's<00:02:12.769> have<00:02:12.829> a<00:02:12.890> look<00:02:13.310> at<00:02:13.459> that<00:02:13.549> shoulder

00:02:13.809 --> 00:02:13.819 
so let's have a look at that shoulder

00:02:13.819 --> 00:02:18.850 
so let's have a look at that shoulder
bail<00:02:16.120> that's<00:02:17.120> just<00:02:17.420> zoom<00:02:17.569> this<00:02:17.780> in

00:02:18.850 --> 00:02:18.860 
bail that's just zoom this in

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:23.560 
bail that's just zoom this in
I<00:02:20.290> just<00:02:21.290> pull<00:02:21.470> that<00:02:21.500> one<00:02:21.770> off<00:02:22.180> so<00:02:23.180> we've<00:02:23.390> got

00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:23.570 
I just pull that one off so we've got

00:02:23.570 --> 00:02:26.710 
I just pull that one off so we've got
the<00:02:23.810> one<00:02:24.700> half<00:02:25.700> of<00:02:25.820> it<00:02:25.970> in<00:02:26.060> there<00:02:26.300> and<00:02:26.540> the

00:02:26.710 --> 00:02:26.720 
the one half of it in there and the

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:28.090 
the one half of it in there and the
other<00:02:26.840> half<00:02:27.080> sticking<00:02:27.530> up<00:02:27.650> there<00:02:27.830> on<00:02:27.980> this

00:02:28.090 --> 00:02:28.100 
other half sticking up there on this

00:02:28.100 --> 00:02:29.800 
other half sticking up there on this
bracket<00:02:28.400> which<00:02:28.790> was<00:02:28.940> originally<00:02:29.120> part<00:02:29.570> of<00:02:29.750> the

00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:29.810 
bracket which was originally part of the

00:02:29.810 --> 00:02:32.710 
bracket which was originally part of the
original<00:02:30.320> metal<00:02:30.650> strapping<00:02:30.950> system<00:02:31.720> I've

00:02:32.710 --> 00:02:32.720 
original metal strapping system I've

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:36.640 
original metal strapping system I've
obviously<00:02:32.870> that<00:02:33.230> just<00:02:33.470> pops<00:02:33.650> in<00:02:35.530> and<00:02:36.530> that

00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:36.650 
obviously that just pops in and that

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:37.810 
obviously that just pops in and that
he'll<00:02:36.770> do<00:02:36.920> pretty<00:02:37.100> well<00:02:37.220> it<00:02:37.430> allows<00:02:37.610> the

00:02:37.810 --> 00:02:37.820 
he'll do pretty well it allows the

00:02:37.820 --> 00:02:41.980 
he'll do pretty well it allows the
shoulder<00:02:38.180> belt<00:02:38.270> a<00:02:38.450> tip<00:02:38.630> ride<00:02:38.900> up<00:02:39.110> and<00:02:40.990> still

00:02:41.980 --> 00:02:41.990 
shoulder belt a tip ride up and still

00:02:41.990 --> 00:02:43.960 
shoulder belt a tip ride up and still
secure<00:02:42.950> that's<00:02:43.190> not<00:02:43.430> going<00:02:43.580> to<00:02:43.670> come<00:02:43.820> off

00:02:43.960 --> 00:02:43.970 
secure that's not going to come off

00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:47.410 
secure that's not going to come off
without<00:02:44.180> them<00:02:45.100> well<00:02:46.100> basically<00:02:46.760> won't<00:02:47.209> come

00:02:47.410 --> 00:02:47.420 
without them well basically won't come

00:02:47.420 --> 00:02:48.910 
without them well basically won't come
off<00:02:47.540> unless<00:02:47.750> you<00:02:47.959> actually<00:02:48.140> grip<00:02:48.530> this<00:02:48.740> and

00:02:48.910 --> 00:02:48.920 
off unless you actually grip this and

00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:52.330 
off unless you actually grip this and
hold<00:02:49.100> it<00:02:49.310> and<00:02:49.490> then<00:02:49.550> pull<00:02:50.000> it<00:02:50.120> off<00:02:50.270> so<00:02:51.160> in<00:02:52.160> the

00:02:52.330 --> 00:02:52.340 
hold it and then pull it off so in the

00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:54.670 
hold it and then pull it off so in the
angle<00:02:53.030> your<00:02:53.450> arm<00:02:53.660> moves<00:02:53.990> there's<00:02:54.350> no<00:02:54.500> wave

00:02:54.670 --> 00:02:54.680 
angle your arm moves there's no wave

00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:58.120 
angle your arm moves there's no wave
pulling<00:02:55.040> that<00:02:55.190> off<00:02:55.480> so<00:02:56.480> the<00:02:57.470> other<00:02:57.650> piece<00:02:57.890> with

00:02:58.120 --> 00:02:58.130 
pulling that off so the other piece with

00:02:58.130 --> 00:03:02.199 
pulling that off so the other piece with
the<00:02:58.280> rib<00:02:58.670> pieces<00:03:00.340> which<00:03:01.340> go<00:03:01.610> on<00:03:01.790> just<00:03:02.030> either

00:03:02.199 --> 00:03:02.209 
the rib pieces which go on just either

00:03:02.209 --> 00:03:04.750 
the rib pieces which go on just either
side<00:03:02.540> here<00:03:02.900> the<00:03:03.650> holes<00:03:04.010> in<00:03:04.190> them<00:03:04.340> are<00:03:04.459> just<00:03:04.610> the

00:03:04.750 --> 00:03:04.760 
side here the holes in them are just the

00:03:04.760 --> 00:03:07.720 
side here the holes in them are just the
right<00:03:04.910> size<00:03:05.180> for<00:03:05.239> some<00:03:05.630> blue<00:03:05.840> LEDs<00:03:06.640> so<00:03:07.640> I'll

00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:07.730 
right size for some blue LEDs so I'll

00:03:07.730 --> 00:03:10.060 
right size for some blue LEDs so I'll
probably<00:03:08.120> be<00:03:08.500> putting<00:03:09.500> some<00:03:09.680> blue<00:03:09.860> light

00:03:10.060 --> 00:03:10.070 
probably be putting some blue light

00:03:10.070 --> 00:03:11.680 
probably be putting some blue light
shining<00:03:10.610> through<00:03:10.640> them<00:03:10.970> once<00:03:11.120> I<00:03:11.270> wire<00:03:11.480> all<00:03:11.660> the

00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:11.690 
shining through them once I wire all the

00:03:11.690 --> 00:03:14.110 
shining through them once I wire all the
electronics<00:03:12.290> up<00:03:12.500> and<00:03:13.340> then<00:03:13.489> we<00:03:13.610> have<00:03:13.760> the<00:03:13.940> one

00:03:14.110 --> 00:03:14.120 
electronics up and then we have the one

00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:16.920 
electronics up and then we have the one
extra<00:03:14.480> piece<00:03:14.660> which<00:03:14.989> mounts<00:03:15.410> on<00:03:15.500> these<00:03:15.680> hooks

00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:16.930 
extra piece which mounts on these hooks

00:03:16.930 --> 00:03:19.390 
extra piece which mounts on these hooks
so<00:03:17.930> it<00:03:18.140> goes<00:03:18.290> there<00:03:18.650> and<00:03:18.920> these<00:03:19.040> go<00:03:19.250> either

00:03:19.390 --> 00:03:19.400 
so it goes there and these go either

00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:22.150 
so it goes there and these go either
side<00:03:19.730> so<00:03:20.110> that<00:03:21.110> should<00:03:21.320> complete<00:03:21.620> the<00:03:21.770> detail

00:03:22.150 --> 00:03:22.160 
side so that should complete the detail

00:03:22.160 --> 00:03:24.430 
side so that should complete the detail
part<00:03:22.459> for<00:03:22.670> the<00:03:22.840> internals<00:03:23.840> obviously<00:03:24.260> once

00:03:24.430 --> 00:03:24.440 
part for the internals obviously once

00:03:24.440 --> 00:03:26.979 
part for the internals obviously once
the<00:03:24.680> chest<00:03:24.950> plate<00:03:25.130> is<00:03:25.430> on<00:03:25.600> there<00:03:26.600> isn't<00:03:26.840> much

00:03:26.979 --> 00:03:26.989 
the chest plate is on there isn't much

00:03:26.989 --> 00:03:29.830 
the chest plate is on there isn't much
to<00:03:27.140> see<00:03:27.290> anyway<00:03:27.709> so<00:03:28.180> it's<00:03:29.180> just<00:03:29.390> so<00:03:29.630> that<00:03:29.810> I

00:03:29.830 --> 00:03:29.840 
to see anyway so it's just so that I

00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:33.430 
to see anyway so it's just so that I
know<00:03:30.140> it's<00:03:30.260> there<00:03:30.470> so<00:03:32.140> let's<00:03:33.140> get<00:03:33.260> those

00:03:33.430 --> 00:03:33.440 
know it's there so let's get those

00:03:33.440 --> 00:03:37.300 
know it's there so let's get those
pieces<00:03:33.709> stuck<00:03:34.100> on<00:03:35.200> and<00:03:36.200> then<00:03:36.739> I<00:03:36.769> should<00:03:36.920> be<00:03:37.130> R

00:03:37.300 --> 00:03:37.310 
pieces stuck on and then I should be R

00:03:37.310 --> 00:03:41.979 
pieces stuck on and then I should be R
to<00:03:37.430> wear<00:03:37.610> the<00:03:37.790> entire<00:03:38.060> upper<00:03:38.360> body<00:03:40.750> alright<00:03:41.750> so

00:03:41.979 --> 00:03:41.989 
to wear the entire upper body alright so

00:03:41.989 --> 00:03:45.460 
to wear the entire upper body alright so
that's<00:03:42.260> a<00:03:43.540> shoulder<00:03:44.540> looks<00:03:44.720> like<00:03:44.900> hey<00:03:45.110> let's

00:03:45.460 --> 00:03:45.470 
that's a shoulder looks like hey let's

00:03:45.470 --> 00:03:55.680 
that's a shoulder looks like hey let's
put<00:03:45.799> this<00:03:45.920> piece<00:03:46.160> on<00:03:51.670> down<00:03:52.670> the<00:03:52.790> other<00:03:52.910> arm<00:03:53.180> on

00:03:55.680 --> 00:03:55.690 

00:03:55.690 --> 00:03:59.199 

is<00:03:56.690> it<00:03:56.840> quite<00:03:57.080> grippy<00:03:57.440> so<00:03:57.890> it's<00:03:58.549> a<00:03:58.670> forceful

00:03:59.199 --> 00:03:59.209 
is it quite grippy so it's a forceful

00:03:59.209 --> 00:04:07.990 
is it quite grippy so it's a forceful
sleeve<00:03:59.510> through<00:03:59.989> there

00:04:07.990 --> 00:04:08.000 

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:24.160 

move<00:04:09.000> that<00:04:09.210> up<00:04:12.710> right<00:04:13.740> and<00:04:14.310> the<00:04:14.520> chess<00:04:14.730> plate

00:04:24.160 --> 00:04:24.170 

00:04:24.170 --> 00:04:33.860 

and<00:04:25.170> there<00:04:25.320> we<00:04:25.440> go<00:04:32.480> so<00:04:33.480> what<00:04:33.660> you'll<00:04:33.840> have

00:04:33.860 --> 00:04:33.870 
and there we go so what you'll have

00:04:33.870 --> 00:04:35.990 
and there we go so what you'll have
noticed<00:04:34.410> when<00:04:34.650> I<00:04:34.680> was<00:04:34.830> trying<00:04:35.160> to<00:04:35.220> get<00:04:35.850> the

00:04:35.990 --> 00:04:36.000 
noticed when I was trying to get the

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:37.580 
noticed when I was trying to get the
armor<00:04:36.360> on<00:04:36.390> there<00:04:36.720> was<00:04:36.990> that<00:04:37.140> the<00:04:37.260> front<00:04:37.470> of

00:04:37.580 --> 00:04:37.590 
armor on there was that the front of

00:04:37.590 --> 00:04:39.520 
armor on there was that the front of
this<00:04:37.710> isn't<00:04:38.010> attached<00:04:38.280> to<00:04:38.460> anything<00:04:38.790> and

00:04:39.520 --> 00:04:39.530 
this isn't attached to anything and

00:04:39.530 --> 00:04:42.620 
this isn't attached to anything and
basically<00:04:40.530> it<00:04:41.010> flaps<00:04:41.250> around<00:04:41.640> so<00:04:42.120> obviously

00:04:42.620 --> 00:04:42.630 
basically it flaps around so obviously

00:04:42.630 --> 00:04:45.440 
basically it flaps around so obviously
these<00:04:43.580> come<00:04:44.580> right<00:04:44.790> away<00:04:44.910> from<00:04:45.180> the<00:04:45.270> volley

00:04:45.440 --> 00:04:45.450 
these come right away from the volley

00:04:45.450 --> 00:04:47.300 
these come right away from the volley
which<00:04:45.720> and<00:04:45.900> once<00:04:46.080> I'd<00:04:46.290> got<00:04:46.320> unhooked<00:04:46.980> while<00:04:47.280> I

00:04:47.300 --> 00:04:47.310 
which and once I'd got unhooked while I

00:04:47.310 --> 00:04:49.280 
which and once I'd got unhooked while I
was<00:04:47.460> trying<00:04:47.640> to<00:04:47.670> get<00:04:47.850> the<00:04:47.940> other<00:04:48.060> arm<00:04:48.150> on<00:04:48.510> so

00:04:49.280 --> 00:04:49.290 
was trying to get the other arm on so

00:04:49.290 --> 00:04:51.230 
was trying to get the other arm on so
the<00:04:49.830> eventual<00:04:50.190> plan<00:04:50.400> is<00:04:50.640> of<00:04:50.760> course<00:04:50.970> that

00:04:51.230 --> 00:04:51.240 
the eventual plan is of course that

00:04:51.240 --> 00:04:52.670 
the eventual plan is of course that
there's<00:04:51.390> some<00:04:51.600> pieces<00:04:51.780> missing<00:04:52.140> which<00:04:52.500> are

00:04:52.670 --> 00:04:52.680 
there's some pieces missing which are

00:04:52.680 --> 00:04:54.590 
there's some pieces missing which are
the<00:04:52.740> side<00:04:52.950> pieces<00:04:53.340> and<00:04:53.850> the<00:04:54.000> back<00:04:54.180> of<00:04:54.390> what

00:04:54.590 --> 00:04:54.600 
the side pieces and the back of what

00:04:54.600 --> 00:04:57.680 
the side pieces and the back of what
make<00:04:54.840> up<00:04:55.050> the<00:04:55.290> complete<00:04:55.740> apps<00:04:56.070> around<00:04:56.690> so

00:04:57.680 --> 00:04:57.690 
make up the complete apps around so

00:04:57.690 --> 00:04:59.930 
make up the complete apps around so
those<00:04:58.590> pieces<00:04:58.800> going<00:04:59.040> to<00:04:59.130> be<00:04:59.220> made<00:04:59.400> next<00:04:59.670> and

00:04:59.930 --> 00:04:59.940 
those pieces going to be made next and

00:04:59.940 --> 00:05:00.740 
those pieces going to be made next and
that's<00:05:00.000> what's<00:05:00.210> going<00:05:00.300> to<00:05:00.360> happen<00:05:00.570> in<00:05:00.690> the

00:05:00.740 --> 00:05:00.750 
that's what's going to happen in the

00:05:00.750 --> 00:05:02.870 
that's what's going to happen in the
next<00:05:00.870> video<00:05:01.230> so<00:05:01.950> obviously<00:05:02.190> once<00:05:02.430> those<00:05:02.670> are

00:05:02.870 --> 00:05:02.880 
next video so obviously once those are

00:05:02.880 --> 00:05:04.190 
next video so obviously once those are
on<00:05:03.030> they<00:05:03.270> will<00:05:03.450> hold<00:05:03.570> the<00:05:03.720> Front's<00:05:04.020> on<00:05:04.110> the

00:05:04.190 --> 00:05:04.200 
on they will hold the Front's on the

00:05:04.200 --> 00:05:06.920 
on they will hold the Front's on the
back<00:05:04.410> and<00:05:05.070> actually<00:05:05.430> um<00:05:05.670> be<00:05:06.180> hooked<00:05:06.390> onto<00:05:06.660> the

00:05:06.920 --> 00:05:06.930 
back and actually um be hooked onto the

00:05:06.930 --> 00:05:08.780 
back and actually um be hooked onto the
back<00:05:07.110> of<00:05:07.140> the<00:05:07.350> torso<00:05:07.560> armor<00:05:08.100> in<00:05:08.280> the<00:05:08.370> same<00:05:08.580> way

00:05:08.780 --> 00:05:08.790 
back of the torso armor in the same way

00:05:08.790 --> 00:05:10.820 
back of the torso armor in the same way
that<00:05:08.940> the<00:05:09.060> a<00:05:09.090> plate<00:05:09.570> is<00:05:09.810> basically<00:05:10.740> with

00:05:10.820 --> 00:05:10.830 
that the a plate is basically with

00:05:10.830 --> 00:05:12.440 
that the a plate is basically with
another<00:05:11.070> piece<00:05:11.280> of<00:05:11.430> bungee<00:05:11.850> and<00:05:12.060> some<00:05:12.270> very

00:05:12.440 --> 00:05:12.450 
another piece of bungee and some very

00:05:12.450 --> 00:05:16.160 
another piece of bungee and some very
similar<00:05:12.780> hooks<00:05:13.140> so<00:05:14.130> contour<00:05:14.580> back<00:05:15.020> and<00:05:16.020> then

00:05:16.160 --> 00:05:16.170 
similar hooks so contour back and then

00:05:16.170 --> 00:05:18.710 
similar hooks so contour back and then
basically<00:05:16.560> that<00:05:16.680> will<00:05:17.210> grip<00:05:18.210> with<00:05:18.420> the<00:05:18.450> side

00:05:18.710 --> 00:05:18.720 
basically that will grip with the side

00:05:18.720 --> 00:05:20.150 
basically that will grip with the side
pieces<00:05:19.050> and<00:05:19.410> that<00:05:19.500> will<00:05:19.620> hold<00:05:19.740> this<00:05:19.950> whole

00:05:20.150 --> 00:05:20.160 
pieces and that will hold this whole

00:05:20.160 --> 00:05:27.080 
pieces and that will hold this whole
thing<00:05:20.400> down<00:05:20.660> so<00:05:21.660> that<00:05:25.550> when<00:05:26.550> everything's<00:05:26.940> in

00:05:27.080 --> 00:05:27.090 
thing down so that when everything's in

00:05:27.090 --> 00:05:27.350 
thing down so that when everything's in
place

00:05:27.350 --> 00:05:27.360 
place

00:05:27.360 --> 00:05:29.840 
place
it's<00:05:27.690> all<00:05:27.870> held<00:05:28.140> nice<00:05:28.860> and<00:05:29.070> snug<00:05:29.370> to<00:05:29.550> the<00:05:29.640> body

00:05:29.840 --> 00:05:29.850 
it's all held nice and snug to the body

00:05:29.850 --> 00:05:34.730 
it's all held nice and snug to the body
back<00:05:30.720> to<00:05:30.930> front<00:05:31.140> and<00:05:31.440> it<00:05:31.620> also<00:05:33.350> holds<00:05:34.350> these<00:05:34.560> at

00:05:34.730 --> 00:05:34.740 
back to front and it also holds these at

00:05:34.740 --> 00:05:37.340 
back to front and it also holds these at
the<00:05:34.830> right<00:05:34.980> height<00:05:35.280> so<00:05:35.750> had<00:05:36.750> some<00:05:36.930> issues<00:05:37.170> with

00:05:37.340 --> 00:05:37.350 
the right height so had some issues with

00:05:37.350 --> 00:05:39.710 
the right height so had some issues with
this<00:05:37.500> slipping<00:05:38.070> but<00:05:38.940> basically<00:05:39.390> we<00:05:39.510> just<00:05:39.540> need

00:05:39.710 --> 00:05:39.720 
this slipping but basically we just need

00:05:39.720 --> 00:05:42.620 
this slipping but basically we just need
to<00:05:39.900> tie<00:05:40.080> that<00:05:40.320> down<00:05:40.820> and<00:05:41.820> then<00:05:42.000> the<00:05:42.150> last<00:05:42.360> piece

00:05:42.620 --> 00:05:42.630 
to tie that down and then the last piece

00:05:42.630 --> 00:05:45.350 
to tie that down and then the last piece
that<00:05:42.870> put<00:05:42.990> on<00:05:43.140> will<00:05:43.290> be<00:05:43.320> the<00:05:43.470> cod<00:05:44.340> plate<00:05:44.670> which

00:05:45.350 --> 00:05:45.360 
that put on will be the cod plate which

00:05:45.360 --> 00:05:47.660 
that put on will be the cod plate which
will<00:05:45.750> go<00:05:45.900> there<00:05:46.200> and<00:05:47.010> that<00:05:47.190> will<00:05:47.340> also<00:05:47.490> be

00:05:47.660 --> 00:05:47.670 
will go there and that will also be

00:05:47.670 --> 00:05:49.400 
will go there and that will also be
coupled<00:05:48.180> to<00:05:48.240> the<00:05:48.390> ad<00:05:48.540> play<00:05:48.810> with<00:05:49.080> another

00:05:49.400 --> 00:05:49.410 
coupled to the ad play with another

00:05:49.410 --> 00:05:51.620 
coupled to the ad play with another
probably<00:05:50.010> another<00:05:50.340> Bungie<00:05:50.910> linkage<00:05:51.360> so

00:05:51.620 --> 00:05:51.630 
probably another Bungie linkage so

00:05:51.630 --> 00:05:53.680 
probably another Bungie linkage so
there's<00:05:51.840> some<00:05:52.050> flexibility<00:05:52.770> in<00:05:52.800> all<00:05:53.010> of<00:05:53.160> this

00:05:53.680 --> 00:05:53.690 
there's some flexibility in all of this

00:05:53.690 --> 00:05:55.880 
there's some flexibility in all of this
and<00:05:54.690> that's<00:05:54.870> basically<00:05:55.260> it<00:05:55.530> then<00:05:55.740> we're

00:05:55.880 --> 00:05:55.890 
and that's basically it then we're

00:05:55.890 --> 00:05:57.620 
and that's basically it then we're
working<00:05:56.250> on<00:05:56.370> the<00:05:56.490> legs<00:05:56.700> again<00:05:56.850> and<00:05:57.210> there's

00:05:57.620 --> 00:05:57.630 
working on the legs again and there's

00:05:57.630 --> 00:05:59.060 
working on the legs again and there's
quite<00:05:57.780> a<00:05:57.840> few<00:05:58.020> videos<00:05:58.140> in<00:05:58.530> the<00:05:58.620> channel<00:05:58.650> about

00:05:59.060 --> 00:05:59.070 
quite a few videos in the channel about

00:05:59.070 --> 00:06:00.650

00:06:04.170 --> 00:06:06.080 
straps and the only last thing that's
remaining<00:06:04.560> is<00:06:04.860> to<00:06:04.980> sort<00:06:05.190> out<00:06:05.370> the<00:06:05.520> thighs<00:06:05.730> and
