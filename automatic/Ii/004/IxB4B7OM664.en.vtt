back I think Cobb said still has a

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:50.029 
back I think Cobb said still has a
decent<00:00:48.570> part<00:00:48.960> of<00:00:49.050> that<00:00:49.140> offense<00:00:49.649> they're

00:00:50.029 --> 00:00:50.039 
decent part of that offense they're

00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:51.170

his hands he's a big play guy I really
do<00:00:53.489> like<00:00:53.640> Cobbs<00:00:53.940> ops<00:00:54.180> the<00:00:54.360> upside<00:00:54.780> from<00:00:54.930> here

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:55.170

eleven<00:00:59.940> ten<00:01:00.059> percent<00:01:00.359> of<00:01:00.420> leagues<00:01:00.570> right<00:01:00.750> now

00:01:00.799 --> 00:01:00.809 
eleven ten percent of leagues right now

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:03.229 
eleven ten percent of leagues right now
I<00:01:01.140> only<00:01:01.289> think<00:01:01.559> you<00:01:01.590> must<00:01:01.949> add<00:01:02.160> in<00:01:02.370> PPR<00:01:02.850> leagues

00:01:03.229 --> 00:01:03.239 
I only think you must add in PPR leagues

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:04.850 
I only think you must add in PPR leagues
so<00:01:03.420> I<00:01:03.449> think<00:01:03.750> he<00:01:03.840> could<00:01:04.019> be<00:01:04.199> kind<00:01:04.439> of<00:01:04.500> a<00:01:04.559> sprawl

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:04.860 
so I think he could be kind of a sprawl

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:07.070 
so I think he could be kind of a sprawl

look at his numbers from week five they
were<00:01:25.320> skewed<00:01:25.680> by<00:01:25.890> one<00:01:26.159> long<00:01:26.400> run<00:01:26.670> so<00:01:26.880> don't

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:27.060 
were skewed by one long run so don't

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:29.660 
were skewed by one long run so don't
necessarily<00:01:27.570> believe<00:01:27.689> his<00:01:27.990> average<00:01:28.439> but<00:01:28.680> he's

00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:29.670 
necessarily believe his average but he's

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:31.429 
necessarily believe his average but he's
worth<00:01:29.880> a<00:01:30.060> look<00:01:30.270> you<00:01:30.780> know<00:01:30.840> might<00:01:31.140> be<00:01:31.259> a<00:01:31.290> decent

00:01:31.429 --> 00:01:31.439 
worth a look you know might be a decent

00:01:31.439 --> 00:01:32.929

going<00:02:57.980> to<00:02:58.070> be<00:02:58.190> the<00:02:58.370> guy<00:02:58.520> that<00:02:58.550> gets<00:02:58.790> all<00:02:59.000> the

00:02:59.110 --> 00:02:59.120 
going to be the guy that gets all the

00:02:59.120 --> 00:03:01.900 
going to be the guy that gets all the
carries<00:02:59.510> into<00:02:59.980> even<00:03:00.980> the<00:03:01.010> person<00:03:01.460> that<00:03:01.490> does

00:03:01.900 --> 00:03:01.910 
carries into even the person that does

00:03:01.910 --> 00:03:03.220

get<00:03:02.090> all<00:03:02.180> the<00:03:02.240> carries<00:03:02.660> probably<00:03:03.050> not<00:03:03.140> gonna

00:03:03.220 --> 00:03:03.230 
get all the carries probably not gonna

00:03:03.230 --> 00:03:05.140 
get all the carries probably not gonna
have<00:03:03.410> the<00:03:03.500> most<00:03:03.680> value<00:03:04.070> since<00:03:04.550> that<00:03:04.760> offensive

00:03:05.140 --> 00:03:05.150 
have the most value since that offensive

00:03:05.150 --> 00:03:07.450 
have the most value since that offensive
line<00:03:05.300> is<00:03:05.720> the<00:03:06.200> worst<00:03:06.410> in<00:03:06.680> the<00:03:06.770> league<00:03:06.800> I<00:03:07.160> think

00:03:07.450 --> 00:03:07.460 
line is the worst in the league I think

00:03:07.460 --> 00:03:09.700
