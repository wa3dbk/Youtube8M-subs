marzipan not icing will stick to it as
I'm<00:01:58.439> working<00:01:58.829> my<00:01:58.979> way<00:01:59.009> through<00:01:59.460> decorating

00:02:00.319 --> 00:02:00.329 
I'm working my way through decorating

00:02:00.329 --> 00:02:04.039 
I'm working my way through decorating
the<00:02:00.450> cake<00:02:00.630> once<00:02:01.469> the<00:02:01.710> cake<00:02:01.950> is<00:02:02.219> level<00:02:03.049> you

00:02:04.039 --> 00:02:04.049 
the cake once the cake is level you

00:02:04.049 --> 00:02:06.350 
the cake once the cake is level you
would<00:02:04.200> then<00:02:04.350> fill<00:02:04.649> in<00:02:04.860> any<00:02:05.430> gaps<00:02:05.610> around<00:02:06.090> the

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:06.360 
would then fill in any gaps around the

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:13.900 
would then fill in any gaps around the
bottom<00:02:06.810> with<00:02:07.229> marzipan

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:13.910 

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:16.330 

you<00:02:14.510> then<00:02:14.720> need<00:02:14.750> to<00:02:14.990> trim<00:02:15.560> the<00:02:16.190> excess

00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:16.340 
you then need to trim the excess

00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:21.760 
you then need to trim the excess
marzipan<00:02:17.060> off<00:02:17.450> from<00:02:17.690> around<00:02:17.810> the<00:02:18.290> base<00:02:20.710> so<00:02:21.710> you

00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:21.770 
marzipan off from around the base so you

00:02:21.770 --> 00:02:24.040

00:02:39.220 --> 00:02:39.230 
there dust your work surface with icing

00:02:39.230 --> 00:02:41.590 
there dust your work surface with icing
sugar<00:02:39.410> to<00:02:39.620> stop<00:02:39.950> the<00:02:40.100> marzipan<00:02:40.400> from<00:02:40.880> sticking

00:02:41.590 --> 00:02:41.600 
sugar to stop the marzipan from sticking

00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:43.900 
sugar to stop the marzipan from sticking
if<00:02:41.750> the<00:02:41.960> marzipan<00:02:42.350> isn't<00:02:42.860> level<00:02:43.070> then<00:02:43.790> it

00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:43.910 
if the marzipan isn't level then it

00:02:43.910 --> 00:02:46.180 
if the marzipan isn't level then it
would<00:02:44.030> affect<00:02:44.510> the<00:02:44.930> overall<00:02:44.960> level<00:02:45.770> of<00:02:45.800> the

00:02:46.180 --> 00:02:46.190 
would affect the overall level of the

00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:48.790 
would affect the overall level of the
cake<00:02:46.430> so<00:02:46.460> we're<00:02:46.760> going<00:02:46.910> to<00:02:46.970> use<00:02:47.240> spacers<00:02:47.800> these

00:02:48.790 --> 00:02:48.800 
cake so we're going to use spacers these

00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:50.950 
cake so we're going to use spacers these
are<00:02:48.980> five<00:02:49.160> millimeters<00:02:49.460> thick<00:02:50.150> which<00:02:50.690> is<00:02:50.840> the

00:02:50.950 --> 00:02:50.960 
are five millimeters thick which is the

00:02:50.960 --> 00:02:54.100 
are five millimeters thick which is the
perfect<00:02:51.470> depth<00:02:51.770> for<00:02:52.190> marzipan<00:02:52.780> so<00:02:53.780> you<00:02:53.900> roll

00:02:54.100 --> 00:02:54.110 
perfect depth for marzipan so you roll

00:02:54.110 --> 00:02:56.950 
perfect depth for marzipan so you roll
the<00:02:54.230> marzipan<00:02:54.560> a<00:02:54.770> bit<00:02:55.010> one<00:02:55.280> way<00:02:55.600> turn<00:02:56.600> it<00:02:56.750> round

00:02:56.950 --> 00:02:56.960 
the marzipan a bit one way turn it round

00:02:56.960 --> 00:03:01.960 
the marzipan a bit one way turn it round
and<00:02:57.710> roll<00:02:58.130> it<00:02:58.280> a<00:02:58.400> bit<00:02:58.610> the<00:02:59.030> other<00:02:59.180> way<00:03:00.670> by<00:03:01.670> doing

00:03:01.960 --> 00:03:01.970 
and roll it a bit the other way by doing

00:03:01.970 --> 00:03:04.150 
and roll it a bit the other way by doing
this<00:03:02.300> it<00:03:02.690> helps<00:03:02.900> keep<00:03:03.290> the<00:03:03.440> marzipan<00:03:03.770> in<00:03:04.100> a

00:03:04.150 --> 00:03:04.160 
this it helps keep the marzipan in a

00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:07.840 
this it helps keep the marzipan in a
nice<00:03:04.340> even<00:03:04.820> shape<00:03:05.860> it<00:03:06.860> also<00:03:07.100> means<00:03:07.490> that<00:03:07.640> if

00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:07.850 
nice even shape it also means that if

00:03:07.850 --> 00:03:10.300 
nice even shape it also means that if
the<00:03:07.970> marzipan<00:03:08.300> starts<00:03:08.960> sticking<00:03:09.260> to<00:03:10.160> your

00:03:10.300 --> 00:03:10.310 
the marzipan starts sticking to your

00:03:10.310 --> 00:03:13.000 
the marzipan starts sticking to your
work<00:03:10.550> surface<00:03:10.880> you<00:03:11.450> can<00:03:11.990> add<00:03:12.110> some<00:03:12.410> more<00:03:12.440> icing

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:13.010 
work surface you can add some more icing

00:03:13.010 --> 00:03:20.380 
work surface you can add some more icing
sugar<00:03:13.390> underneath<00:03:18.190> so<00:03:19.190> you<00:03:19.280> roll<00:03:19.550> it<00:03:19.730> you<00:03:20.090> turn

00:03:20.380 --> 00:03:20.390 
sugar underneath so you roll it you turn

00:03:20.390 --> 00:03:25.120 
sugar underneath so you roll it you turn
it<00:03:20.540> round<00:03:21.190> and<00:03:22.190> you<00:03:22.340> roll<00:03:22.550> it<00:03:22.700> a<00:03:22.820> bit<00:03:23.000> more<00:03:24.130> and

00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:25.130 
it round and you roll it a bit more and

00:03:25.130 --> 00:03:29.320 
it round and you roll it a bit more and
you<00:03:25.370> keep<00:03:25.550> rolling<00:03:26.150> until<00:03:26.530> it<00:03:27.530> won't<00:03:27.770> go<00:03:28.330> any

00:03:29.320 --> 00:03:29.330 
you keep rolling until it won't go any

00:03:29.330 --> 00:03:32.050 
you keep rolling until it won't go any
thinner<00:03:29.950> because<00:03:30.950> the<00:03:31.070> spaces<00:03:31.550> will<00:03:31.730> stop

00:03:32.050 --> 00:03:32.060 
thinner because the spaces will stop

00:03:32.060 --> 00:03:34.590 
thinner because the spaces will stop
here<00:03:32.390> once<00:03:33.050> it's<00:03:33.290> at<00:03:33.440> its<00:03:33.620> ideal<00:03:34.040> thickness

00:03:34.590 --> 00:03:34.600 
here once it's at its ideal thickness

00:03:34.600 --> 00:03:37.390 
here once it's at its ideal thickness
you<00:03:35.600> can<00:03:35.780> either<00:03:35.900> use<00:03:36.290> apricot<00:03:36.560> glaze<00:03:37.160> or

00:03:37.390 --> 00:03:37.400 
you can either use apricot glaze or

00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:39.850 
you can either use apricot glaze or
piping<00:03:37.850> jelly<00:03:38.240> to<00:03:38.360> stick<00:03:38.630> the<00:03:38.780> marzipan<00:03:39.170> to

00:03:39.850 --> 00:03:39.860 
piping jelly to stick the marzipan to

00:03:39.860 --> 00:03:40.510 
piping jelly to stick the marzipan to
the<00:03:39.980> cake

00:03:40.510 --> 00:03:40.520 
the cake

00:03:40.520 --> 00:03:42.370 
the cake
I<00:03:40.550> prefer<00:03:41.300> piping<00:03:41.780> jelly<00:03:42.020> because<00:03:42.200> it's

00:03:42.370 --> 00:03:42.380 
I prefer piping jelly because it's

00:03:42.380 --> 00:03:44.860 
I prefer piping jelly because it's
easier<00:03:42.800> to<00:03:42.830> use<00:03:43.010> when<00:03:43.970> you<00:03:44.090> want<00:03:44.270> to<00:03:44.330> brush<00:03:44.570> it

00:03:44.860 --> 00:03:44.870 
easier to use when you want to brush it

00:03:44.870 --> 00:03:46.260 
easier to use when you want to brush it
onto<00:03:45.350> the<00:03:45.590> marzipan

00:03:46.260 --> 00:03:46.270 
onto the marzipan

00:03:46.270 --> 00:03:48.970 
onto the marzipan
if<00:03:47.270> you<00:03:47.450> brushed<00:03:47.720> it<00:03:47.959> onto<00:03:48.260> the<00:03:48.350> cake<00:03:48.530> you<00:03:48.739> tend

00:03:48.970 --> 00:03:48.980 
if you brushed it onto the cake you tend

00:03:48.980 --> 00:03:51.390 
if you brushed it onto the cake you tend
to<00:03:49.070> find<00:03:49.310> that<00:03:49.550> you<00:03:49.640> get<00:03:49.790> crumbs<00:03:50.180> everywhere

00:03:51.390 --> 00:03:51.400 
to find that you get crumbs everywhere

00:03:51.400 --> 00:03:55.050 
to find that you get crumbs everywhere
pick<00:03:52.400> the<00:03:52.580> marzipan<00:03:52.910> up<00:03:53.300> on<00:03:53.840> your<00:03:54.080> rolling<00:03:54.410> pin

00:03:55.050 --> 00:03:55.060 
pick the marzipan up on your rolling pin

00:03:55.060 --> 00:03:58.300 
pick the marzipan up on your rolling pin
scoop<00:03:56.060> the<00:03:56.239> cake<00:03:56.450> underneath<00:03:56.900> and<00:03:57.830> place<00:03:58.100> the

00:05:17.960 --> 00:05:17.970 
subsequent tiers they're on a thin board

00:05:17.970 --> 00:05:19.850
