to<00:05:26.150> the<00:05:26.419> planet<00:05:27.050> I<00:05:27.139> applied<00:05:27.650> so<00:05:28.310> it<00:05:28.370> kind<00:05:28.639> of

00:05:28.689 --> 00:05:28.699 
to the planet I applied so it kind of

00:05:28.699 --> 00:05:31.360 
to the planet I applied so it kind of
creates<00:05:29.030> this<00:05:29.120> nice<00:05:29.360> purple<00:05:29.780> reddish<00:05:30.409> ombre

00:05:31.360 --> 00:05:31.370 
creates this nice purple reddish ombre

00:05:31.370 --> 00:05:36.279 
creates this nice purple reddish ombre
effect<00:05:33.729> so<00:05:34.729> this<00:05:34.909> is<00:05:35.090> the<00:05:35.240> look<00:05:35.449> if<00:05:35.690> it's<00:05:36.020> just

00:05:36.279 --> 00:05:36.289 
effect so this is the look if it's just

00:05:36.289 --> 00:05:39.189
