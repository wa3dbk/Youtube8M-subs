00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.170
 we really have to avoid wheat and 

00:00:02.460 --> 00:00:07.259
 other cereals for a diet 

00:00:04.170 --> 00:00:09.480
 healthy the rising wave of 

00:00:07.259 --> 00:00:11.670
 food thinking takes care of 

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:14.490
 point to wheat products and 

00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:18.539
 like other grains like the new evils 

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:20.490
 food from this perspective is 

00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:22.609
 stresses that the consumption of these 

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:24.990
 food causes us undesirable 

00:00:22.609 --> 00:00:27.240
 fluctuations in blood glucose that 

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:30.119
 end up ending in resistance to 

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:32.340
 insulin or type 2 diabetes is also 

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:34.469
 ensures that they favor inflammation 

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:37.860
 general that predispose us to suffer 

00:00:34.469 --> 00:00:41.460
 caries cardiovascular diseases and 

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:44.309
 even cancer and certainly one of the 

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:46.649
 worse unemployed is the wheat by besides 

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:49.320
 everything exposed to lodge in his 

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:51.239
 composition the gluten a protein that 

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:54.420
 causes serious health problems in 

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:56.730
 those celiac people however 

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:59.699
 we also find the vision 

00:00:56.730 --> 00:01:01.620
 The most classic nutritional 

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:03.899
 that the problem is not the grains and 

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:06.010
 cereals but the high intake of 

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:08.800
 animal protein 

00:01:06.010 --> 00:01:12.190
 and defends a diet based on 

00:01:08.800 --> 00:01:15.010
 cereals grains legumes fruits 

00:01:12.190 --> 00:01:18.280
 vegetables and nuts as the key 

00:01:15.010 --> 00:01:22.060
 to maintain optimal health who 

00:01:18.280 --> 00:01:24.160
 is right there are cereals and cereals not 

00:01:22.060 --> 00:01:26.470
 There is no doubt that the usual when 

00:01:24.160 --> 00:01:28.420
 we buy a loaf of bread or a package 

00:01:26.470 --> 00:01:31.450
 of rice bar pasta is to buy the 

00:01:28.420 --> 00:01:34.750
 refined versions that is to say the 

00:01:31.450 --> 00:01:38.410
 usually called normal bread or 

00:01:34.750 --> 00:01:40.510
 normal rice and the truth is that these 

00:01:38.410 --> 00:01:43.000
 refined grains or cereals have been 

00:01:40.510 --> 00:01:43.570
 associated with numerous problems for the 

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:46.810
 Health 

00:01:43.570 --> 00:01:49.450
 on the one hand they cause large increases in 

00:01:46.810 --> 00:01:51.700
 blood glucose which leads to our 

00:01:49.450 --> 00:01:54.700
 organism to release a lot of 

00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:57.190
 Insulin also also appear to activate 

00:01:54.700 --> 00:01:59.620
 a general inflammatory response that 

00:01:57.190 --> 00:02:03.010
 may predispose to heart disease 

00:01:59.620 --> 00:02:05.350
 type 2 diabetes or cancer the pimples 

00:02:03.010 --> 00:02:07.869
 refined people also tend to contribute very 

00:02:05.350 --> 00:02:09.550
 little fiber so its satiating effect 

00:02:07.869 --> 00:02:12.040
 it is also less 

00:02:09.550 --> 00:02:12.580
 All this means that the grains 

00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:14.610
 refine 

00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:18.700
 we found in breakfast cereals 

00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:20.910
 on the white bread in the bakery as well 

00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:24.040
 in the pasta and white rice are 

00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:26.890
 nutritionally rather poorer than 

00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:29.680
 its original version unrefined by 

00:02:26.890 --> 00:02:31.810
 all this is widely accepted that 

00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:35.200
 it is convenient to limit the intake of 

00:02:31.810 --> 00:02:37.660
 cereals and refined grains however 

00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:39.970
 the real problem is that there is no 

00:02:37.660 --> 00:02:43.630
 clear what food we can buy as 

00:02:39.970 --> 00:02:46.090
 really whole grain in many 

00:02:43.630 --> 00:02:48.730
 cases especially in those 

00:02:46.090 --> 00:02:51.640
 products packed and or processed as 

00:02:48.730 --> 00:02:53.800
 the whole version bread is nothing but 

00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:56.770
 a mixture of refined flours with a 

00:02:53.800 --> 00:02:59.620
 handful of wheat bran quinoa for 

00:02:56.770 --> 00:03:02.260
 it really interesting grains 

00:02:59.620 --> 00:03:03.070
 are whole wheat wild rice or 

00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:06.190
 integral 

00:03:03.070 --> 00:03:08.170
 the quinoa oats or even less 

00:03:06.190 --> 00:03:10.840
 known as millet or spelled 

00:03:08.170 --> 00:03:13.570
 In addition to legumes, of course 

00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:15.700
 because even though the current 

00:03:13.570 --> 00:03:18.700
 trend have dried up in demonize 

00:03:15.700 --> 00:03:19.480
 these foods there is an important body 

00:03:18.700 --> 00:03:21.700
 of avidity 

00:03:19.480 --> 00:03:23.620
 since it suggests that cereals and other 

00:03:21.700 --> 00:03:26.890
 whole grains have a role 

00:03:23.620 --> 00:03:29.080
 health flattering for example 

00:03:26.890 --> 00:03:31.239
 whole grains could reduce the 

00:03:29.080 --> 00:03:34.360
 inflammation and not increase the how 

00:03:31.239 --> 00:03:36.730
 some postulate a published review 

00:03:34.360 --> 00:03:39.069
 in nutrition review it was found that each 

00:03:36.730 --> 00:03:42.129
 consumed ration of whole grains is 

00:03:39.069 --> 00:03:44.530
 associated with a 7% reduction in 

00:03:42.129 --> 00:03:47.019
 protein levels it reactivates a 

00:03:44.530 --> 00:03:50.170
 common marker of inflammation of all 

00:03:47.019 --> 00:03:53.440
 the body plus many whole grains 

00:03:50.170 --> 00:03:55.450
 they have a mean glycemic index low 

00:03:53.440 --> 00:03:57.870
 which means that they only have a small 

00:03:55.450 --> 00:04:01.359
 effect on our blood glucose 

00:03:57.870 --> 00:04:03.310
 a meta-analysis published in the journal 

00:04:01.359 --> 00:04:06.579
 of nutrition that has collected the 

00:04:03.310 --> 00:04:09.340
 results of 45 studies concludes that 

00:04:06.579 --> 00:04:11.890
 those people who consumed 3 to 5 

00:04:09.340 --> 00:04:14.709
 servings of whole grains per day 

00:04:11.890 --> 00:04:17.880
 they had a 26% lower risk of 

00:04:14.709 --> 00:04:20.769
 develop type 2 diabetes and a risk 

00:04:17.880 --> 00:04:22.960
 21% lower than developing disease 

00:04:20.769 --> 00:04:25.870
 cardiovascular than those who never or 

00:04:22.960 --> 00:04:28.930
 they rarely eat whole grains 

00:04:25.870 --> 00:04:31.510
 summarizing cereals and whole grains 

00:04:28.930 --> 00:04:34.360
 that have not undergone any process of 

00:04:31.510 --> 00:04:37.090
 refinement are good options and weigh 

00:04:34.360 --> 00:04:39.610
 to the current tendency to demonize them not 

00:04:37.090 --> 00:04:42.220
 there seems to be reasons to eliminate them from 

00:04:39.610 --> 00:04:44.740
 the food to know how to choose 

00:04:42.220 --> 00:04:48.070
 those products made as the 

00:04:44.740 --> 00:04:50.830
 Really interesting pasta bread 

00:04:48.070 --> 00:04:53.410
 some researches recommend 

00:04:50.830 --> 00:04:56.020
 choose the versions that ensure the 

00:04:53.410 --> 00:04:58.840
 minus one gram of fiber for every 10 

00:04:56.020 --> 00:05:00.880
 grams of carbohydrates another point 

00:04:58.840 --> 00:05:03.090
 important to consider should be the 

00:05:00.880 --> 00:05:06.340
 amount to consume of these foods 

00:05:03.090 --> 00:05:08.350
 in no case is consumption recommended 

00:05:06.340 --> 00:05:10.330
 so wide that it displaces from our 

00:05:08.350 --> 00:05:13.620
 feeding other groups such as 

00:05:10.330 --> 00:05:13.620
 fruits or vegetables
