00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:44.850 
take action in the Northeast because you

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:46.279 
take action in the Northeast because you
don't<00:00:45.000> want<00:00:45.180> to<00:00:45.270> have<00:00:45.360> the<00:00:45.450> storm<00:00:45.719> moving<00:00:45.960> in

00:00:46.289 --> 00:00:47.990 
don't want to have the storm moving in
and<00:00:46.559> have<00:00:46.739> to<00:00:46.860> do<00:00:46.980> it<00:00:47.070> at<00:00:47.160> that<00:00:47.190> time<00:00:47.370> and<00:00:47.760> we<00:00:47.879> do

00:00:47.990 --> 00:00:48.000 
and have to do it at that time and we do

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:49.729 
and have to do it at that time and we do
think<00:00:48.210> that<00:00:48.270> a<00:00:48.360> widespread<00:00:48.870> wind<00:00:49.050> storm<00:00:49.559> is

00:00:49.729 --> 00:00:49.739 
think that a widespread wind storm is

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:52.610 
think that a widespread wind storm is
entirely<00:00:50.190> likely<00:00:50.969> across<00:00:51.510> most<00:00:52.350> of<00:00:52.559> the

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:52.620 
entirely likely across most of the

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:54.740 
entirely likely across most of the
Northeast<00:00:53.129> that<00:00:53.610> will<00:00:53.699> be<00:00:53.820> developing<00:00:54.480> late

00:00:54.740 --> 00:00:54.750 
Northeast that will be developing late

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:56.510

time as well my experience is people say

00:04:21.940 --> 00:04:23.130 
time as well my experience is people say
they're<00:04:22.120> not<00:04:22.270> going<00:04:22.390> to<00:04:22.480> move<00:04:22.600> the<00:04:22.780> next<00:04:22.990> time

they're not going to move the next time

00:04:23.140 --> 00:04:24.840 
they're not going to move the next time
when<00:04:23.290> they<00:04:23.380> go<00:04:23.500> through<00:04:23.710> a<00:04:23.740> near<00:04:23.950> miss<00:04:24.220> but

00:04:24.840 --> 00:04:24.850 
when they go through a near miss but

00:04:24.850 --> 00:04:27.300 
when they go through a near miss but
then<00:04:25.090> a<00:04:25.300> huge<00:04:25.780> storm<00:04:26.170> is<00:04:26.380> coming<00:04:26.740> at<00:04:26.860> them<00:04:27.010> they

00:04:27.300 --> 00:04:27.310 
then a huge storm is coming at them they

00:04:27.310 --> 00:04:29.130 
then a huge storm is coming at them they
see<00:04:27.370> it<00:04:27.640> on<00:04:27.730> television<00:04:27.880> they<00:04:28.510> hear<00:04:28.780> the<00:04:28.930> talk

00:04:29.130 --> 00:04:29.140 
see it on television they hear the talk

00:04:29.140 --> 00:04:31.530 
see it on television they hear the talk
they<00:04:29.740> get<00:04:29.950> scared<00:04:30.310> they<00:04:30.670> get<00:04:30.850> concerned<00:04:31.180> and

00:04:31.530 --> 00:04:31.540 
they get scared they get concerned and

00:04:31.540 --> 00:04:34.080 
they get scared they get concerned and
they<00:04:32.260> move<00:04:32.500> anyway<00:04:33.070> and<00:04:33.310> I<00:04:33.700> think<00:04:33.760> that's

00:04:34.080 --> 00:04:34.090 
they move anyway and I think that's

00:04:34.090 --> 00:04:35.640 
they move anyway and I think that's
likely<00:04:34.300> to<00:04:34.510> happen<00:04:34.540> with<00:04:34.960> this<00:04:35.080> storm<00:04:35.410> and

00:04:35.640 --> 00:04:35.650 
likely to happen with this storm and

00:04:35.650 --> 00:04:38.490 
likely to happen with this storm and
remember<00:04:36.130> sandy<00:04:36.880> is<00:04:36.910> potentially<00:04:37.840> a<00:04:37.870> storm<00:04:38.290> of

00:04:38.490 --> 00:04:38.500 
remember sandy is potentially a storm of

00:04:38.500 --> 00:04:40.560 
remember sandy is potentially a storm of
extraordinary<00:04:39.310> proportions<00:04:40.000> one<00:04:40.360> of<00:04:40.480> the

00:04:40.560 --> 00:04:40.570 
extraordinary proportions one of the

00:04:40.570 --> 00:04:42.360 
extraordinary proportions one of the
reasons<00:04:40.930> why<00:04:41.230> this<00:04:41.290> storm<00:04:41.920> is<00:04:42.040> going<00:04:42.190> to<00:04:42.280> be

00:04:42.360 --> 00:04:42.370 
reasons why this storm is going to be

00:04:42.370 --> 00:04:44.460 
reasons why this storm is going to be
such<00:04:42.610> a<00:04:42.640> big<00:04:42.910> problem<00:04:43.210> is<00:04:43.540> because<00:04:44.170> of<00:04:44.290> the

00:04:44.460 --> 00:04:44.470 
such a big problem is because of the

00:04:44.470 --> 00:04:46.920 
such a big problem is because of the
size<00:04:44.740> of<00:04:44.920> the<00:04:44.980> winds<00:04:45.400> associated<00:04:45.820> with<00:04:46.270> it<00:04:46.419> we

00:04:46.920 --> 00:04:46.930 
size of the winds associated with it we

00:04:46.930 --> 00:04:48.360 
size of the winds associated with it we
could<00:04:47.140> have<00:04:47.260> damaging<00:04:47.710> winds<00:04:47.890> across

00:04:48.360 --> 00:04:48.370 
could have damaging winds across

00:04:48.370 --> 00:04:50.250 
could have damaging winds across
hundreds<00:04:48.940> of<00:04:49.060> miles<00:04:49.300> of<00:04:49.600> coast<00:04:49.870> along<00:04:50.050> the
