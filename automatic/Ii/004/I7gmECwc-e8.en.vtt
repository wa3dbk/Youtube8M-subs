good<00:04:17.200> you<00:04:18.200> gotta<00:04:18.380> check<00:04:18.709> where<00:04:18.980> you're<00:04:19.100> going

00:04:26.250 --> 00:04:26.260 

00:04:26.260 --> 00:04:28.840 

it's<00:04:27.260> amazing<00:04:27.650> he's<00:04:27.770> still<00:04:27.980> this<00:04:28.220> agile<00:04:28.640> even

00:04:28.840 --> 00:04:28.850 
it's amazing he's still this agile even

00:04:28.850 --> 00:04:33.280 
it's amazing he's still this agile even
when<00:04:28.970> he's<00:04:29.120> a<00:04:29.210> huge<00:04:29.450> huge<00:04:29.960> ass<00:04:30.230> lion<00:04:30.620> I<00:04:32.290> think

00:04:33.280 --> 00:04:33.290 
when he's a huge huge ass lion I think

00:04:33.290 --> 00:04:34.150 
when he's a huge huge ass lion I think
you'd<00:04:33.410> only<00:04:33.530> be<00:04:33.680> able<00:04:33.770> to<00:04:33.860> do<00:04:33.950> all<00:04:34.130> that

00:04:34.150 --> 00:04:34.160 
you'd only be able to do all that

00:04:34.160 --> 00:04:38.710 
you'd only be able to do all that
flipping<00:04:34.700> stuff<00:04:34.910> when<00:04:35.060> he's<00:04:35.150> a<00:04:35.180> kid<00:04:37.720> no

00:04:51.650 --> 00:04:56.600 

and<00:04:52.759> bug<00:04:53.759> I<00:04:54.150> guess<00:04:55.050> increases<00:04:55.590> my<00:04:55.770> roar<00:04:56.129> limit

00:04:56.600 --> 00:04:56.610 
and bug I guess increases my roar limit

00:04:56.610 --> 00:04:59.869 
and bug I guess increases my roar limit
even<00:04:56.969> though<00:04:57.180> i<00:04:57.210> don't<00:04:57.479> really<00:04:58.550> the<00:04:59.550> point<00:04:59.759> of
