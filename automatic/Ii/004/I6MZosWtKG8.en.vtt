if you can get all that I'm just afraid

00:03:03.209 --> 00:03:05.990 
if you can get all that I'm just afraid
to<00:03:03.740> get<00:03:04.740> down<00:03:04.890> there<00:03:05.069> and<00:03:05.190> ruin<00:03:05.430> my<00:03:05.459> blade<00:03:05.790> in

00:03:05.990 --> 00:03:06.000 
to get down there and ruin my blade in

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:09.410 
to get down there and ruin my blade in
the<00:03:06.060> dirt<00:03:06.300> so<00:03:06.800> I'm<00:03:07.800> not<00:03:08.040> digging<00:03:08.250> down<00:03:08.550> as<00:03:08.700> far

00:03:09.410 --> 00:03:09.420 
the dirt so I'm not digging down as far

00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:12.380 
the dirt so I'm not digging down as far
as<00:03:09.450> I<00:03:09.600> could<00:03:09.810> but<00:03:09.990> I<00:03:10.230> took<00:03:10.560> more<00:03:10.890> time<00:03:10.920> I<00:03:11.430> could

00:03:12.380 --> 00:03:12.390 
as I could but I took more time I could

00:03:12.390 --> 00:03:15.050 
as I could but I took more time I could
dig<00:03:12.569> that<00:03:12.720> out<00:03:12.780> too<00:03:13.550> but<00:03:14.550> this<00:03:14.700> will<00:03:14.850> be<00:03:14.880> an

00:03:15.050 --> 00:03:15.060 
dig that out too but this will be an

00:03:15.060 --> 00:03:25.190 
dig that out too but this will be an
adequate<00:03:15.480> demonstration<00:03:16.230> I<00:03:24.110> think<00:03:25.110> it's

00:03:25.190 --> 00:03:25.200 
adequate demonstration I think it's

00:03:25.200 --> 00:03:56.660 
adequate demonstration I think it's
gonna<00:03:25.319> need<00:03:25.560> more<00:03:25.709> heat

00:03:56.660 --> 00:03:56.670 

00:03:56.670 --> 00:03:58.890

00:04:21.510 --> 00:04:21.520 
away these outer layers it's plenty hot

00:04:21.520 --> 00:04:32.340 
away these outer layers it's plenty hot
I<00:04:22.290> just<00:04:23.290> don't<00:04:23.440> know<00:04:23.500> if<00:04:23.530> it's<00:04:23.710> done

00:04:32.340 --> 00:04:32.350 

00:04:32.350 --> 00:04:34.200 

this<00:04:32.920> is<00:04:33.040> the<00:04:33.130> end<00:04:33.310> that<00:04:33.430> was<00:04:33.640> resting<00:04:34.000> on<00:04:34.120> the
