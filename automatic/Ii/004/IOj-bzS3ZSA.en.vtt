00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:00.660

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:14.610 
pets was abducted or something of the

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:15.859 
pets was abducted or something of the
sort<00:01:14.670> by<00:01:15.060> an<00:01:15.119> alien<00:01:15.270> and<00:01:15.600> then<00:01:15.689> they<00:01:15.810> were

00:01:15.859 --> 00:01:15.869 
sort by an alien and then they were

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:17.810

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:17.820 
released and now they're on some

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:19.280 
released and now they're on some
different<00:01:17.970> planets<00:01:18.479> or<00:01:18.600> something<00:01:18.720> it's<00:01:19.049> kind

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:19.290 
different planets or something it's kind

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:21.260 
different planets or something it's kind
of<00:01:19.409> vague<00:01:19.650> and<00:01:19.979> not<00:01:20.490> very<00:01:20.640> important<00:01:21.119> to<00:01:21.180> the

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:21.270 
of vague and not very important to the

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:23.090 
of vague and not very important to the
actual<00:01:21.540> game<00:01:21.570> so<00:01:22.290> we<00:01:22.409> won't<00:01:22.590> hark<00:01:22.799> on<00:01:22.950> that

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:23.100 
actual game so we won't hark on that

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:24.649 
actual game so we won't hark on that
much<00:01:23.310> but<00:01:23.490> the<00:01:23.610> innovation<00:01:23.970> itself<00:01:24.030> was<00:01:24.420> nice

00:01:24.649 --> 00:01:24.659 
much but the innovation itself was nice

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:26.149 
much but the innovation itself was nice
it<00:01:24.900> really<00:01:25.110> did<00:01:25.229> remind<00:01:25.470> us<00:01:25.680> a<00:01:25.770> lot<00:01:25.890> of<00:01:25.920> the

00:01:26.149 --> 00:01:26.159 
it really did remind us a lot of the

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:28.730 
it really did remind us a lot of the
opening<00:01:26.670> Angry<00:01:26.970> Birds<00:01:27.180> animations<00:01:27.780> or<00:01:27.990> any<00:01:28.680> of

00:04:26.310 --> 00:04:26.320 
of these levels is to guided the

00:04:26.320 --> 00:04:27.630 
of these levels is to guided the
character<00:04:26.740> from<00:04:26.920> one<00:04:27.100> end<00:04:27.250> to<00:04:27.310> the<00:04:27.370> other<00:04:27.460> and

00:04:27.630 --> 00:04:27.640 
character from one end to the other and

00:04:27.640 --> 00:04:28.980 
character from one end to the other and
then<00:04:27.850> ultimately<00:04:28.030> jump<00:04:28.600> them<00:04:28.720> into<00:04:28.900> the

00:04:28.980 --> 00:04:28.990 
then ultimately jump them into the

00:04:28.990 --> 00:04:30.330 
then ultimately jump them into the
portal<00:04:29.350> sometimes<00:04:29.710> the<00:04:29.890> portal<00:04:30.160> is<00:04:30.190> not

00:04:30.330 --> 00:04:30.340 
portal sometimes the portal is not

00:04:30.340 --> 00:04:31.650 
portal sometimes the portal is not
activated<00:04:30.730> so<00:04:30.940> you<00:04:31.000> have<00:04:31.120> to<00:04:31.180> find<00:04:31.300> a<00:04:31.450> button

00:04:31.650 --> 00:04:31.660 
activated so you have to find a button

00:04:31.660 --> 00:04:33.540 
activated so you have to find a button
to<00:04:31.990> smack<00:04:32.710> and<00:04:32.980> then<00:04:33.070> you<00:04:33.160> get<00:04:33.310> to<00:04:33.340> jump

00:04:33.540 --> 00:04:33.550 
to smack and then you get to jump

00:04:33.550 --> 00:04:35.460 
to smack and then you get to jump
through<00:04:33.730> the<00:04:33.820> portal<00:04:34.120> etc<00:04:34.660> likewise<00:04:35.290> there

00:04:35.460 --> 00:04:35.470 
through the portal etc likewise there

00:04:35.470 --> 00:04:36.630 
through the portal etc likewise there
are<00:04:35.500> a<00:04:35.560> ton<00:04:35.650> of<00:04:35.710> different<00:04:35.890> obstacles<00:04:36.310> and

00:04:36.630 --> 00:04:36.640 
are a ton of different obstacles and

00:04:36.640 --> 00:04:38.190 
are a ton of different obstacles and
things<00:04:36.850> in<00:04:37.000> the<00:04:37.120> way<00:04:37.300> we're<00:04:37.870> going<00:04:37.960> to<00:04:38.080> show

things in the way we're going to show

00:04:38.200 --> 00:04:39.930 
things in the way we're going to show
you<00:04:38.260> a<00:04:38.380> slightly<00:04:38.920> different<00:04:39.220> game<00:04:39.520> mechanic

00:04:39.930 --> 00:04:39.940 
you a slightly different game mechanic

00:04:39.940 --> 00:04:42.810 
you a slightly different game mechanic
using<00:04:40.240> the<00:04:40.330> Goldie<00:04:40.720> character<00:04:41.550> because<00:04:42.550> each

00:04:42.810 --> 00:04:42.820 
using the Goldie character because each

00:04:42.820 --> 00:04:44.940 
using the Goldie character because each
of<00:04:43.000> the<00:04:43.150> pets<00:04:43.810> involved<00:04:43.990> has<00:04:44.530> its<00:04:44.740> own

of the pets involved has its own
specific<00:04:45.570> style<00:04:46.570> of<00:04:46.840> play<00:04:47.170> which<00:04:47.800> we<00:04:47.980> really

00:04:48.270 --> 00:04:48.280 
specific style of play which we really

00:04:48.280 --> 00:04:49.500 
specific style of play which we really
appreciate<00:04:48.670> that<00:04:48.700> adds<00:04:48.970> an<00:04:49.120> immense<00:04:49.420> amount

00:04:49.500 --> 00:04:49.510 
appreciate that adds an immense amount

00:04:49.510 --> 00:04:51.090 
appreciate that adds an immense amount
of<00:04:49.720> complexity<00:04:50.170> to<00:04:50.290> an<00:04:50.440> already<00:04:50.620> fairly

00:04:51.090 --> 00:04:51.100 
of complexity to an already fairly

of complexity to an already fairly
complex<00:04:51.550> app<00:04:51.880> again<00:04:52.420> this<00:04:52.720> is<00:04:52.900> not<00:04:53.080> just<00:04:53.350> an

00:04:53.430 --> 00:04:53.440 
complex app again this is not just an

00:04:55.290 --> 00:04:55.300 
angry birds Clemens adds you know a

00:04:55.300 --> 00:04:57.150 
angry birds Clemens adds you know a
whole<00:04:55.510> lot<00:04:55.540> of<00:04:55.660> other<00:04:55.810> elements<00:04:56.470> to<00:04:56.710> the<00:04:56.920> same

00:04:57.150 --> 00:04:57.160 
whole lot of other elements to the same

00:04:57.160 --> 00:04:59.010 
whole lot of other elements to the same
current<00:04:57.490> kind<00:04:57.790> of<00:04:57.880> physics<00:04:58.210> mechanic<00:04:58.780> in<00:04:58.960> the

00:04:59.010 --> 00:04:59.020 
current kind of physics mechanic in the

00:04:59.020 --> 00:05:02.010 
current kind of physics mechanic in the
sense<00:04:59.770> of<00:04:59.950> you<00:05:00.160> have<00:05:00.430> that<00:05:00.790> basic<00:05:01.030> point<00:05:01.900> and

00:05:02.010 --> 00:05:02.020 
sense of you have that basic point and

00:05:02.020 --> 00:05:03.960 
sense of you have that basic point and
shoot<00:05:02.170> method<00:05:02.560> but<00:05:02.710> at<00:05:02.800> the<00:05:02.890> same<00:05:03.100> time<00:05:03.340> he

00:05:03.960 --> 00:05:03.970 
shoot method but at the same time he

00:05:03.970 --> 00:05:05.700 
shoot method but at the same time he
also<00:05:04.000> gets<00:05:04.390> so<00:05:04.600> much<00:05:04.720> more<00:05:04.930> thrown<00:05:05.230> in<00:05:05.440> for

00:05:05.700 --> 00:05:05.710 
also gets so much more thrown in for

00:05:05.710 --> 00:05:08.480 
also gets so much more thrown in for
instance<00:05:06.070> this<00:05:06.280> character<00:05:06.760> can<00:05:07.480> jump<00:05:07.810> twice

00:05:08.480 --> 00:05:08.490 
instance this character can jump twice

00:05:08.490 --> 00:05:11.700 
instance this character can jump twice
and<00:05:09.490> a<00:05:09.610> go<00:05:09.820> which<00:05:10.420> we're<00:05:10.960> about<00:05:11.020> to<00:05:11.170> fall<00:05:11.470> we

00:05:11.700 --> 00:05:11.710 
and a go which we're about to fall we

00:05:11.710 --> 00:05:13.080 
and a go which we're about to fall we
really<00:05:11.980> like<00:05:12.100> this<00:05:12.220> animation<00:05:12.640> by<00:05:12.880> the<00:05:12.940> way

00:05:13.080 --> 00:05:13.090 
really like this animation by the way

00:05:13.090 --> 00:05:14.490 
really like this animation by the way
the<00:05:13.210> sort<00:05:13.420> of<00:05:13.510> screaming<00:05:13.870> it's<00:05:14.200> kind<00:05:14.470> of

00:05:14.490 --> 00:05:14.500 
the sort of screaming it's kind of

00:05:14.500 --> 00:05:15.750 
the sort of screaming it's kind of
sadistic<00:05:14.740> but<00:05:15.100> we<00:05:15.160> really<00:05:15.370> did<00:05:15.520> think<00:05:15.670> that

00:05:15.750 --> 00:05:15.760 
sadistic but we really did think that

00:05:15.760 --> 00:05:18.690 
sadistic but we really did think that
was<00:05:15.880> cute<00:05:16.210> so<00:05:16.990> in<00:05:17.260> that<00:05:17.410> sense<00:05:17.680> each<00:05:17.980> pet<00:05:18.400> comes

00:05:18.690 --> 00:05:18.700 
was cute so in that sense each pet comes

00:05:18.700 --> 00:05:20.700 
was cute so in that sense each pet comes
with<00:05:18.850> its<00:05:19.030> own<00:05:19.150> mechanic<00:05:19.750> adding<00:05:20.440> even<00:05:20.560> more

00:05:20.700 --> 00:05:20.710 
with its own mechanic adding even more

00:05:20.710 --> 00:05:22.470 
with its own mechanic adding even more
depth<00:05:21.250> to<00:05:21.340> the<00:05:21.580> gameplay<00:05:21.610> which<00:05:22.180> is<00:05:22.300> fantastic

00:05:22.470 --> 00:05:22.480 
depth to the gameplay which is fantastic

00:05:22.480 --> 00:05:24.690 
depth to the gameplay which is fantastic
likewise<00:05:23.440> the<00:05:23.710> levels<00:05:24.130> themselves<00:05:24.190> look

00:05:24.690 --> 00:05:24.700 
likewise the levels themselves look

00:05:24.700 --> 00:05:26.760 
likewise the levels themselves look
great<00:05:25.060> and<00:05:25.720> when<00:05:25.840> you<00:05:25.900> look<00:05:25.960> at<00:05:26.170> this<00:05:26.320> it's<00:05:26.620> a

00:05:26.760 --> 00:05:26.770 
great and when you look at this it's a

00:05:26.770 --> 00:05:29.130 
great and when you look at this it's a
very<00:05:27.040> nice<00:05:27.220> animations<00:05:27.940> very<00:05:28.510> slightly<00:05:28.870> and

00:05:29.130 --> 00:05:29.140 
very nice animations very slightly and

00:05:29.140 --> 00:05:31.950 
very nice animations very slightly and
very<00:05:29.290> engaging<00:05:29.880> so<00:05:30.880> with<00:05:31.180> that<00:05:31.390> mind<00:05:31.750> that's

00:05:31.950 --> 00:05:31.960 
very engaging so with that mind that's

00:05:31.960 --> 00:05:33.660 
very engaging so with that mind that's
pretty<00:05:32.230> much<00:05:32.350> all<00:05:32.530> we<00:05:32.740> have<00:05:32.950> to<00:05:33.100> say<00:05:33.160> about<00:05:33.430> the

00:05:33.660 --> 00:05:33.670 
pretty much all we have to say about the

00:05:33.670 --> 00:05:36.870 
pretty much all we have to say about the
initial<00:05:33.940> content<00:05:34.450> here<00:05:35.460> aside<00:05:36.460> for<00:05:36.640> the<00:05:36.670> fact

00:05:36.870 --> 00:05:36.880 
initial content here aside for the fact

initial content here aside for the fact
we<00:05:37.030> just<00:05:37.240> died<00:05:37.480> again<00:05:37.840> some<00:05:38.470> to<00:05:38.560> see<00:05:38.680> if<00:05:38.740> I

00:05:38.760 --> 00:05:38.770 
we just died again some to see if I

00:05:38.770 --> 00:05:41.280 
we just died again some to see if I
can't<00:05:38.980> get<00:05:39.070> us<00:05:39.160> back<00:05:39.370> to<00:05:39.490> the<00:05:39.580> main<00:05:39.760> menu<00:05:40.290> the

can't get us back to the main menu the

00:05:41.290 --> 00:05:42.630 
can't get us back to the main menu the
