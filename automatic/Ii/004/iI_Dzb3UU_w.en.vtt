to<00:03:29.319> tags<00:03:33.510> 10<00:03:34.510> go<00:03:34.989> to<00:03:35.049> simulation<00:03:35.799> tags<00:03:36.100> and<00:03:36.670> go

00:03:37.080 --> 00:03:37.090 
to tags 10 go to simulation tags and go

00:03:37.090 --> 00:03:44.839 
to tags 10 go to simulation tags and go
to<00:03:37.150> rigid<00:03:37.780> body<00:03:38.040> and<00:03:39.780> then<00:03:41.489> when<00:03:42.489> you<00:03:42.609> play<00:03:42.880> it

00:03:44.839 --> 00:03:44.849 
to rigid body and then when you play it

00:03:44.849 --> 00:03:49.610 
to rigid body and then when you play it
you<00:03:45.849> notice<00:03:46.120> it<00:03:46.239> slides<00:03:46.540> across<00:03:46.870> the<00:03:47.139> floor

00:03:49.610 --> 00:03:49.620 

00:03:49.620 --> 00:03:52.319 

and<00:03:50.620> you'll<00:03:51.040> have<00:03:51.190> all<00:03:51.340> the<00:03:51.370> reflections<00:03:51.760> and

00:03:52.319 --> 00:03:52.329 
and you'll have all the reflections and

00:03:52.329 --> 00:03:54.690 
and you'll have all the reflections and
stuff<00:03:52.599> well<00:03:53.349> normally<00:03:54.310> you<00:03:54.370> wouldn't<00:03:54.519> have

00:03:54.690 --> 00:03:54.700 
stuff well normally you wouldn't have

00:03:54.700 --> 00:03:58.770 
stuff well normally you wouldn't have
that<00:03:54.760> many<00:03:55.060> reflections<00:03:55.329> but<00:03:56.019> I<00:03:57.540> have<00:03:58.540> some

00:03:58.770 --> 00:03:58.780 
that many reflections but I have some

00:03:58.780 --> 00:04:00.990 
that many reflections but I have some
planes<00:03:59.019> up<00:03:59.349> so<00:04:00.040> it<00:04:00.250> makes<00:04:00.430> it<00:04:00.579> a<00:04:00.669> little<00:04:00.790> bit

00:04:00.990 --> 00:04:01.000 
planes up so it makes it a little bit

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:05.849 
planes up so it makes it a little bit
more<00:04:01.180> reflective<00:04:03.959> and<00:04:04.959> yeah<00:04:05.200> and<00:04:05.410> if<00:04:05.470> you<00:04:05.590> put

00:04:05.849 --> 00:04:05.859 
more reflective and yeah and if you put

00:04:05.859 --> 00:04:08.630 
more reflective and yeah and if you put
on<00:04:06.069> ambient<00:04:06.909> occlusion

00:04:08.630 --> 00:04:08.640 
on ambient occlusion

00:04:08.640 --> 00:04:11.840 
on ambient occlusion
I<00:04:08.870> look<00:04:09.870> a<00:04:09.930> bit<00:04:10.110> better<00:04:10.490> yeah<00:04:11.490> but<00:04:11.640> it<00:04:11.730> might

00:04:11.840 --> 00:04:11.850 
I look a bit better yeah but it might

00:04:11.850 --> 00:04:14.030 
I look a bit better yeah but it might
take<00:04:12.060> wall<00:04:12.270> to<00:04:12.390> render<00:04:12.750> and<00:04:13.470> if<00:04:13.590> you're<00:04:13.770> doing

00:04:14.030 --> 00:04:14.040 
take wall to render and if you're doing

00:04:14.040 --> 00:04:18.410 
take wall to render and if you're doing
a<00:04:14.480> intro<00:04:15.480> you<00:04:15.810> might<00:04:16.019> wanna<00:04:16.260> you<00:04:17.420> probably

00:04:18.410 --> 00:04:18.420 
a intro you might wanna you probably

00:04:18.420 --> 00:04:19.400 
a intro you might wanna you probably
don't<00:04:18.540> want<00:04:18.660> to<00:04:18.810> do<00:04:18.900> that<00:04:18.930> but<00:04:19.230> if<00:04:19.260> you're

00:04:19.400 --> 00:04:19.410 
don't want to do that but if you're

00:04:19.410 --> 00:04:24.800 
don't want to do that but if you're
doing<00:04:19.590> a<00:04:19.650> single<00:04:19.890> image<00:04:20.280> that's<00:04:20.549> fine<00:04:23.810> and

00:04:24.800 --> 00:04:24.810 
doing a single image that's fine and

00:04:24.810 --> 00:04:34.460 
doing a single image that's fine and
that's<00:04:24.870> really<00:04:25.860> basically<00:04:26.340> all<00:04:33.050> yeah<00:04:34.050> you<00:04:34.260> can

00:04:34.460 --> 00:04:34.470 
that's really basically all yeah you can

00:04:34.470 --> 00:04:36.140 
that's really basically all yeah you can
do<00:04:34.650> this<00:04:34.830> for<00:04:35.100> any<00:04:35.160> object<00:04:35.640> you<00:04:35.730> can<00:04:35.760> do<00:04:35.910> it<00:04:36.000> for

00:04:36.140 --> 00:04:36.150 
do this for any object you can do it for

00:04:36.150 --> 00:04:40.310 
do this for any object you can do it for
our<00:04:36.270> cube<00:04:37.520> anything<00:04:38.520> in<00:04:38.669> here<00:04:39.030> but<00:04:39.270> I<00:04:39.540> just<00:04:40.110> did

00:04:40.310 --> 00:04:40.320 
our cube anything in here but I just did

00:04:40.320 --> 00:04:42.620 
our cube anything in here but I just did
it<00:04:40.440> with<00:04:40.590> text<00:04:41.370> just<00:04:41.610> because<00:04:42.000> that's<00:04:42.450> what

00:04:42.620 --> 00:04:42.630 
it with text just because that's what

00:04:42.630 --> 00:04:46.790 
it with text just because that's what
most<00:04:42.810> people<00:04:43.140> want<00:04:43.230> to<00:04:43.410> do<00:04:44.810> but<00:04:45.810> actually

00:04:46.790 --> 00:04:46.800 
most people want to do but actually

00:04:46.800 --> 00:04:50.360 
most people want to do but actually
really<00:04:47.010> quickly<00:04:47.490> I<00:04:47.520> can<00:04:47.790> show<00:04:48.210> you<00:04:49.250> what<00:04:50.250> it

00:04:50.360 --> 00:04:50.370 
really quickly I can show you what it

00:04:50.370 --> 00:04:55.480 
really quickly I can show you what it
looks<00:04:50.400> like<00:04:50.669> on<00:04:50.820> a<00:04:50.880> cube<00:04:51.780> or<00:04:52.200> a<00:04:52.230> few<00:04:52.650> objects

00:04:55.480 --> 00:04:55.490 

00:04:55.490 --> 00:05:05.510 

cube<00:04:56.490> cone<00:05:03.560> sorry<00:05:04.560> about<00:05:04.650> that<00:05:04.800> I'd<00:05:05.190> to<00:05:05.340> eat

00:05:05.510 --> 00:05:05.520 
cube cone sorry about that I'd to eat

00:05:05.520 --> 00:05:09.140 
cube cone sorry about that I'd to eat
dinner<00:05:05.840> but<00:05:06.919> to<00:05:07.919> get<00:05:08.010> back<00:05:08.070> to<00:05:08.400> what<00:05:08.700> we<00:05:08.880> were

00:05:09.140 --> 00:05:09.150 
dinner but to get back to what we were

00:05:09.150 --> 00:05:15.290 
dinner but to get back to what we were
doing<00:05:10.520> i'm<00:05:11.520> gonna<00:05:11.760> select<00:05:13.790> just<00:05:14.790> basically<00:05:15.120> do

00:05:15.290 --> 00:05:15.300 
doing i'm gonna select just basically do

00:05:15.300 --> 00:05:18.700 
doing i'm gonna select just basically do
the<00:05:15.330> same<00:05:15.450> thing<00:05:15.960> but<00:05:17.180> i'm<00:05:18.180> just<00:05:18.419> going<00:05:18.570> to

00:05:18.700 --> 00:05:18.710 
the same thing but i'm just going to

00:05:18.710 --> 00:05:23.740 
the same thing but i'm just going to
spread<00:05:19.710> each<00:05:19.890> one<00:05:20.130> of<00:05:20.160> these<00:05:20.310> out<00:05:20.580> and<00:05:22.280> then

00:05:23.740 --> 00:05:23.750 
spread each one of these out and then

00:05:23.750 --> 00:05:27.170 
spread each one of these out and then
we're<00:05:24.750> going<00:05:24.840> to<00:05:24.900> want<00:05:25.110> to<00:05:25.140> go<00:05:25.260> to<00:05:25.880> just<00:05:26.880> do<00:05:27.060> the

00:05:27.170 --> 00:05:27.180 
we're going to want to go to just do the

00:05:27.180 --> 00:05:30.860 
we're going to want to go to just do the
same<00:05:27.450> thing<00:05:29.090> this<00:05:30.090> time<00:05:30.150> i'm<00:05:30.450> going<00:05:30.540> to<00:05:30.630> put

00:05:30.860 --> 00:05:30.870 
same thing this time i'm going to put

00:05:30.870 --> 00:05:35.659 
same thing this time i'm going to put
just<00:05:31.669> 15<00:05:33.470> oops<00:05:34.470> i<00:05:34.590> forgot<00:05:34.710> to<00:05:34.830> select<00:05:35.040> objects

00:05:35.659 --> 00:05:35.669 
just 15 oops i forgot to select objects

00:05:35.669 --> 00:05:42.260 
just 15 oops i forgot to select objects
make<00:05:36.300> sure<00:05:36.330> you<00:05:36.570> do<00:05:36.690> that<00:05:40.790> okay<00:05:41.790> that<00:05:42.090> was

00:05:42.260 --> 00:05:42.270 
make sure you do that okay that was

00:05:42.270 --> 00:05:47.430 
make sure you do that okay that was
pretty<00:05:42.600> fast

00:05:47.430 --> 00:05:47.440 

00:05:47.440 --> 00:05:51.420 

really<00:05:47.920> nice<00:05:48.070> physics<00:05:49.860> acts<00:05:50.860> like<00:05:51.190> it<00:05:51.310> would

00:05:51.420 --> 00:05:51.430 
really nice physics acts like it would

00:05:51.430 --> 00:05:57.840 
really nice physics acts like it would
be<00:05:51.870> in<00:05:52.870> real<00:05:53.110> life<00:05:54.120> and<00:05:56.190> I'm<00:05:57.190> going<00:05:57.430> to<00:05:57.460> put<00:05:57.700> on

00:05:57.840 --> 00:05:57.850 
be in real life and I'm going to put on

00:05:57.850 --> 00:06:03.950 
be in real life and I'm going to put on
ambient<00:05:58.330> inclusion<00:05:58.780> so<00:05:59.020> it<00:05:59.110> looks<00:05:59.260> a<00:05:59.380> bit<00:05:59.500> real

00:06:03.950 --> 00:06:03.960 

00:06:03.960 --> 00:06:08.790 

that<00:06:04.960> looks<00:06:04.990> very<00:06:05.530> nice<00:06:07.170> well<00:06:08.170> thank<00:06:08.590> you<00:06:08.620> guys
