00:00:28.189 --> 00:00:28.199 
tanks so there are a few things to

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:30.140 
tanks so there are a few things to
consider<00:00:28.590> here<00:00:28.680> one<00:00:29.310> this<00:00:29.640> is<00:00:29.760> only<00:00:29.880> going<00:00:30.090> to

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:34.050 
rounds this is not gonna be possible

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:37.130

not British lay off the targets and we

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:40.729 
not British lay off the targets and we
also<00:00:39.600> need<00:00:39.899> to<00:00:40.020> remember<00:00:40.200> that<00:00:40.350> this<00:00:40.559> is

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:48.870 
that previously whereas a ricochet could

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:52.010 
that previously whereas a ricochet could
only<00:00:49.350> damage<00:00:49.890> your<00:00:50.219> own<00:00:50.370> vehicle<00:00:50.640> ie<00:00:51.420> we<00:00:51.809> might

should be really exciting but I have to

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:31.819 
should be really exciting but I have to
say<00:01:30.270> after<00:01:30.540> the<00:01:30.780> extensive<00:01:31.470> amount<00:01:31.530> of

00:01:31.819 --> 00:01:31.829 
say after the extensive amount of

00:01:31.829 --> 00:01:33.649 
say after the extensive amount of
testing<00:01:32.280> that<00:01:32.369> we<00:01:32.490> did<00:01:32.729> don't<00:01:33.329> think<00:01:33.540> it's

00:01:33.649 --> 00:01:33.659 
testing that we did don't think it's

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:35.420 
testing that we did don't think it's
gonna<00:01:33.780> be<00:01:33.960> happening<00:01:34.380> all<00:01:34.530> the<00:01:34.560> time<00:01:34.710> when<00:01:35.310> it

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:35.430 
gonna be happening all the time when it

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:37.429 
gonna be happening all the time when it
does<00:01:35.579> happen<00:01:35.759> this<00:01:36.659> could<00:01:36.840> be<00:01:37.020> something

00:01:37.429 --> 00:01:37.439 
does happen this could be something

00:01:37.439 --> 00:01:39.499 
does happen this could be something
truly<00:01:37.680> spectacular<00:01:38.009> and<00:01:38.820> just<00:01:39.180> to<00:01:39.270> show<00:01:39.450> you

00:01:39.499 --> 00:01:39.509 
truly spectacular and just to show you

00:01:39.509 --> 00:01:47.270 
truly spectacular and just to show you
what<00:01:39.750> it<00:01:39.840> looks<00:01:39.990> like

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:47.280 

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:49.380 

we'll<00:01:48.280> just<00:01:48.430> have<00:01:48.580> a<00:01:48.610> look<00:01:48.790> at<00:01:48.940> that<00:01:49.060> one<00:01:49.240> in

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:49.390 
we'll just have a look at that one in

00:01:49.390 --> 00:01:53.190 
we'll just have a look at that one in
slow<00:01:49.630> motion<00:01:51.119> we<00:01:52.119> can<00:01:52.270> see<00:01:52.450> that<00:01:52.600> it<00:01:52.750> travels

00:01:53.190 --> 00:01:53.200 
slow motion we can see that it travels

00:01:53.200 --> 00:02:02.430 
slow motion we can see that it travels
its<00:01:53.380> way<00:01:55.350> it's<00:01:56.350> the<00:01:56.500> mouse<00:01:56.680> there<00:02:01.290> manages<00:02:02.290> to

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:02.440 
its way it's the mouse there manages to

00:02:02.440 --> 00:02:06.630 
its way it's the mouse there manages to
bounce<00:02:02.710> off<00:02:04.440> straight<00:02:05.440> into<00:02:06.250> the<00:02:06.369> enemy's

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:06.640 
bounce off straight into the enemy's

00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:10.859 
bounce off straight into the enemy's
tank<00:02:06.909> penetrating<00:02:07.690> him<00:02:07.869> and<00:02:08.789> that<00:02:09.789> is<00:02:10.630> what's

00:02:10.859 --> 00:02:10.869 
tank penetrating him and that is what's

00:02:10.869 --> 00:02:13.170 
tank penetrating him and that is what's
gonna<00:02:11.020> be<00:02:11.170> possible<00:02:11.350> next<00:02:11.920> patch<00:02:12.100> so<00:02:12.850> I<00:02:12.880> hope

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:13.180 
gonna be possible next patch so I hope

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:15.090
