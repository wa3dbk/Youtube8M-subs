00:00:08.410 --> 00:00:13.420
 click you created to leave the phone 

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:15.150
 bambuco which we have here 

00:00:13.420 --> 00:00:17.520
 and leave it 

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:19.289
 the perfect Castilian- with google 

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:22.259
 play installed and with all the bullshit 

00:00:19.289 --> 00:00:25.079
 Chinese removed from the middle on the other hand 

00:00:22.259 --> 00:00:26.789
 also the script contains a series of 

00:00:25.079 --> 00:00:29.369
 improvements which a few 

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:32.580
 introduced myself and a few others 

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:36.059
 introduced the companion healy the 

00:00:32.580 --> 00:00:37.440
 football you can download the link I've 

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:40.350
 modified a bit since our 

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:42.120
 partner prefers to use the lounge polo 

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:45.059

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:47.850

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:49.730
 make him full pleasure the bamboo 

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:53.090
 phrase of the lake 

00:00:49.730 --> 00:00:56.420
 total that is the Chinese without anything of 

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:58.310
 Castilian totally as it is 

00:00:56.420 --> 00:01:00.760
 usually buy in china 

00:00:58.310 --> 00:01:04.460
 Well now what we are going to do is 

00:01:00.760 --> 00:01:06.730
 turn it on and connect connecting the 

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:06.730
 usb 

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:13.440
 OK 

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:15.960
 and it's worth I just want to say before that I already 

00:01:13.440 --> 00:01:17.640
 I have installed the drivers and 

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:20.310
 obviously I do not need 

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:24.080
 I update the latest version because 

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:26.700
 the bamboo flasher that I used then 

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:29.980
 it was the last one that he has taken out so 

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:33.060
 currently brings the latest version 

00:01:29.980 --> 00:01:37.049
 I just need to execute the script 

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:40.950
 he has already loaded and now we go to the pc and 

00:01:37.049 --> 00:01:45.240
 run love we enjoy the script 

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:47.490
 first use is worth as it comes first 

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:50.000
 which is newly purchased the first one there 

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:50.000
 what to do next 

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:53.329
 begins 

00:01:56.360 --> 00:02:01.430
 to see without any problem seems to be 

00:01:59.180 --> 00:02:03.590
 are happening 

00:02:01.430 --> 00:02:06.830
 the first thing removed the application 

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:10.340
 corner and now it's starting to happen 

00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:12.789
 the applications to the phone has first 

00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:12.789
 been him 

00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:19.599
 first has been the gmail play store 

00:02:16.379 --> 00:02:23.640
 google backup google calendar google 

00:02:19.599 --> 00:02:23.640
 contacts google or bing 

00:02:24.230 --> 00:02:29.450
 but it's worth it if you notice, he's giving me the 

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:31.549
 error of this device is busy 

00:02:29.450 --> 00:02:34.000
 in this case you can cancel with 

00:02:31.549 --> 00:02:34.000
 control c 

00:02:34.610 --> 00:02:40.290
 disconnects from mobile the use of mobile and 

00:02:38.240 --> 00:02:43.760
 reconnect 

00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:43.760
 we come back logical try 

00:02:45.250 --> 00:02:48.410
 evidently in failure the first 

00:02:46.630 --> 00:02:50.360
 Applications 

00:02:48.410 --> 00:02:54.430
 and continue where the error 

00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:58.409
 it's worth the third 

00:02:54.430 --> 00:02:58.409
 and now if you want then for example 

00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:06.720
 You see he was moving, he's been a little crazy 

00:03:02.980 --> 00:03:09.480
 do not worry, unlock and 

00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:12.570
 Even if this error comes out if you want before 

00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:14.840
 to restart as last you can go back to 

00:03:12.570 --> 00:03:14.840
 try out 

00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:31.490
 equal to if you notice you are already giving us 

00:03:26.849 --> 00:03:33.710
 the device error 

00:03:31.490 --> 00:03:35.860
 busy is installing all the 

00:03:33.710 --> 00:03:35.860
 Applications 

00:03:37.040 --> 00:03:41.290
 the error is usually given because there 

00:03:39.439 --> 00:03:43.420
 some application 

00:03:41.290 --> 00:03:45.400
 that at that moment is being used 

00:03:43.420 --> 00:03:48.180
 then impossible about writing it or 

00:03:45.400 --> 00:03:48.180
 eliminate it 

00:03:48.960 --> 00:03:52.520
 good little remains 

00:03:57.200 --> 00:03:59.770
 OK 

00:04:00.740 --> 00:04:04.450
 the phone just restarted me 

00:04:08.790 --> 00:04:14.810
 if you notice the movice just risk 

00:04:10.650 --> 00:04:14.810
 we can remove the cable if we want 

00:04:17.130 --> 00:04:22.040
 and you get a message of optimization 

00:04:19.890 --> 00:04:22.040
 of 

00:04:22.639 --> 00:04:28.849
 you see and focus seems optimization of 

00:04:25.999 --> 00:04:31.719
 applications starting applications and 

00:04:28.849 --> 00:04:31.719
 ending home 

00:04:38.180 --> 00:04:43.820
 is already in Spanish 

00:04:41.660 --> 00:04:46.270
 with some application installed as standard 

00:04:43.820 --> 00:04:46.270
 of Google 

00:04:48.240 --> 00:04:54.320
 and with the play store installed 

00:04:50.810 --> 00:04:55.940
 well I hope this has served in 

00:04:54.320 --> 00:04:58.240
 less than five minutes you have everything 

00:04:55.940 --> 00:04:58.240
 ready
