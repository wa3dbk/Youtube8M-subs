00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:25.790 
so it's a great challenge really to get

00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:27.520 
so it's a great challenge really to get
both<00:02:26.060> of<00:02:26.239> them<00:02:26.390> making<00:02:26.690> great<00:02:26.900> movies<00:02:27.260> each

00:02:31.330 --> 00:02:31.340 
having their own identity which means

00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:33.670 
having their own identity which means
instability<00:02:31.910> bit<00:02:32.090> that<00:02:32.330> we<00:02:33.050> don't<00:02:33.230> not<00:02:33.650> only

00:02:33.670 --> 00:02:33.680 
instability bit that we don't not only

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:35.580 
instability bit that we don't not only
we're<00:02:33.980> not<00:02:34.010> merging<00:02:34.519> together<00:02:34.640> but<00:02:35.180> we<00:02:35.269> don't

00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:35.590 
we're not merging together but we don't

00:02:35.590 --> 00:02:37.509 
we're not merging together but we don't
partition<00:02:36.590> up<00:02:36.709> the<00:02:36.830> world<00:02:37.010> and<00:02:37.190> say<00:02:37.280> you<00:02:37.340> do

00:02:37.509 --> 00:02:37.519 
partition up the world and say you do

00:02:37.519 --> 00:02:39.460 
partition up the world and say you do
one<00:02:37.700> kind<00:02:37.940> of<00:02:37.970> thing<00:02:38.120> you<00:02:38.239> do<00:02:38.330> the<00:02:38.450> other<00:02:38.600> we

00:02:39.460 --> 00:02:39.470 
one kind of thing you do the other we

00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:42.460 
one kind of thing you do the other we
have<00:02:39.680> to<00:02:39.860> let<00:02:40.130> each<00:02:40.340> one<00:02:40.930> follow<00:02:41.930> the<00:02:42.140> artistic

00:02:42.460 --> 00:02:42.470 
have to let each one follow the artistic

00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:47.590 
have to let each one follow the artistic
vision<00:02:43.040> of<00:02:43.160> the<00:02:43.250> directors<00:02:43.700> they're<00:02:43.880> there

00:02:47.590 --> 00:02:47.600
