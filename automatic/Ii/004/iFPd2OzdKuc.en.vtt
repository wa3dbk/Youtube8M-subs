00:00:14.209 --> 00:00:14.219 
an enhancement that was made to the use

00:00:14.219 --> 00:00:18.769 
an enhancement that was made to the use
of<00:00:14.250> forming<00:00:14.910> tools<00:00:15.150> in<00:00:15.360> SolidWorks<00:00:15.809> 2012<00:00:17.779> so

00:00:18.769 --> 00:00:18.779 
of forming tools in SolidWorks 2012 so

00:00:18.779 --> 00:00:20.179 
of forming tools in SolidWorks 2012 so
say<00:00:19.020> we<00:00:19.140> have<00:00:19.230> a<00:00:19.289> sheet<00:00:19.470> metal<00:00:19.560> part<00:00:19.890> here<00:00:20.039> we

00:00:20.179 --> 00:00:20.189 
say we have a sheet metal part here we

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:22.730 
say we have a sheet metal part here we
want<00:00:20.369> to<00:00:20.460> add<00:00:20.580> some<00:00:21.480> louvers<00:00:21.840> to<00:00:22.020> it<00:00:22.140> we<00:00:22.680> can

00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:22.740 
want to add some louvers to it we can

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:25.519 
want to add some louvers to it we can
simply<00:00:23.189> go<00:00:23.400> to<00:00:23.430> the<00:00:23.730> design<00:00:24.180> library<00:00:24.500> go<00:00:25.500> to

00:00:25.519 --> 00:00:25.529 
simply go to the design library go to

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:28.189 
simply go to the design library go to
the<00:00:25.680> forming<00:00:26.070> tools<00:00:26.310> area<00:00:26.609> and<00:00:27.000> drag<00:00:27.539> in<00:00:27.720> over

00:00:28.189 --> 00:00:28.199 
the forming tools area and drag in over

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:30.320 
the forming tools area and drag in over
and<00:00:28.439> when<00:00:29.039> I<00:00:29.070> want<00:00:29.279> to<00:00:29.340> position<00:00:29.550> it<00:00:29.820> I<00:00:29.970> can<00:00:30.210> use

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:30.330 
and when I want to position it I can use

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:33.020 
and when I want to position it I can use
the<00:00:30.480> tab<00:00:30.689> key<00:00:30.720> to<00:00:31.109> switch<00:00:31.700> if<00:00:32.700> it's<00:00:32.850> going<00:00:32.969> to

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:33.030 
the tab key to switch if it's going to

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:35.870 
the tab key to switch if it's going to
go<00:00:33.180> in<00:00:33.420> or<00:00:33.750> out<00:00:34.020> of<00:00:34.200> the<00:00:34.380> sheet<00:00:34.710> metal<00:00:34.829> and<00:00:35.100> I

00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:35.880 
go in or out of the sheet metal and I

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:37.459 
go in or out of the sheet metal and I
can<00:00:36.059> use<00:00:36.180> the<00:00:36.329> arrow<00:00:36.450> keys<00:00:36.570> to<00:00:36.809> rotate<00:00:37.350> it

00:00:37.459 --> 00:00:37.469 
can use the arrow keys to rotate it

00:00:37.469 --> 00:00:42.110 
can use the arrow keys to rotate it
around<00:00:37.559> and<00:00:38.040> place<00:00:38.879> it<00:00:39.059> now<00:00:40.050> in<00:00:40.410> 2012<00:00:40.980> with<00:00:41.969> the

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:42.120 
around and place it now in 2012 with the

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:44.900 
around and place it now in 2012 with the
placement<00:00:42.450> we<00:00:42.719> can<00:00:42.870> now<00:00:43.170> use<00:00:43.500> positions<00:00:44.160> tab

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:44.910 
placement we can now use positions tab

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:50.500 
placement we can now use positions tab
here<00:00:45.590> to<00:00:47.149> position<00:00:48.149> the<00:00:48.329> initial<00:00:49.219> instance

00:00:50.500 --> 00:00:50.510 
here to position the initial instance

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:59.470 
here to position the initial instance
with<00:00:51.510> smart<00:00:51.809> dimensions<00:00:54.920> and<00:00:56.149> we<00:00:57.149> can<00:00:57.329> also

00:00:59.470 --> 00:00:59.480 
with smart dimensions and we can also

00:00:59.480 --> 00:01:11.610 
with smart dimensions and we can also
let's<00:01:00.480> get<00:01:00.629> this<00:01:00.750> dimension<00:01:01.199> on<00:01:01.350> here

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:11.620 

00:01:11.620 --> 00:01:17.140 

and<00:01:12.700> we<00:01:13.700> could<00:01:13.850> also<00:01:13.970> pattern<00:01:14.750> and<00:01:15.790> the<00:01:16.790> sketch

00:01:17.140 --> 00:01:17.150 
and we could also pattern and the sketch

00:01:17.150 --> 00:01:21.210 
and we could also pattern and the sketch
into<00:01:17.510> instance<00:01:18.170> is<00:01:18.350> for<00:01:18.800> the<00:01:19.340> forming<00:01:20.030> tool

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:21.220 
into instance is for the forming tool

00:01:21.220 --> 00:02:04.679 
into instance is for the forming tool
want<00:01:22.220> to<00:01:22.280> go<00:01:22.400> here<00:01:24.369> sketch<00:01:25.369> pattern

00:02:04.679 --> 00:02:04.689 

00:02:04.689 --> 00:02:06.730 

alright<00:02:05.689> so<00:02:05.869> we're<00:02:06.020> going<00:02:06.110> to<00:02:06.290> accept<00:02:06.590> those

00:02:06.730 --> 00:02:06.740 
alright so we're going to accept those

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:08.080 
alright so we're going to accept those
positions<00:02:07.130> and<00:02:07.579> it<00:02:07.700> looks<00:02:07.820> like<00:02:07.880> they're

00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:08.090 
positions and it looks like they're

00:02:08.090 --> 00:02:11.620 
positions and it looks like they're
nicely<00:02:08.330> spaced<00:02:08.810> on<00:02:09.080> our<00:02:09.289> part<00:02:10.220> here<00:02:10.640> and<00:02:11.540> you

00:02:11.620 --> 00:02:11.630 
nicely spaced on our part here and you

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:14.650 
nicely spaced on our part here and you
see<00:02:11.810> in<00:02:11.900> the<00:02:12.020> type<00:02:12.290> tab<00:02:13.300> there's<00:02:14.300> a<00:02:14.360> new<00:02:14.480> option

00:02:14.650 --> 00:02:14.660 
see in the type tab there's a new option

00:02:14.660 --> 00:02:19.839 
see in the type tab there's a new option
to<00:02:14.959> link<00:02:15.200> this<00:02:17.260> this<00:02:18.260> forming<00:02:18.680> tool<00:02:18.860> to<00:02:19.670> the

00:02:19.839 --> 00:02:19.849 
to link this this forming tool to the

00:02:19.849 --> 00:02:21.520 
to link this this forming tool to the
forming<00:02:20.150> tool<00:02:20.330> that<00:02:20.599> we<00:02:20.690> chose<00:02:20.930> which<00:02:21.349> is

00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:21.530 
forming tool that we chose which is

00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:24.339 
forming tool that we chose which is
louver<00:02:21.860> in<00:02:21.980> this<00:02:22.130> case<00:02:22.510> that<00:02:23.510> way<00:02:23.690> any<00:02:23.930> changes

00:02:24.339 --> 00:02:24.349 
louver in this case that way any changes

00:02:24.349 --> 00:02:28.390 
louver in this case that way any changes
we<00:02:24.380> make<00:02:24.680> to<00:02:25.489> the<00:02:26.560> louver<00:02:27.560> forming<00:02:28.160> tool<00:02:28.310> or

00:02:28.390 --> 00:02:28.400 
we make to the louver forming tool or

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:30.040 
we make to the louver forming tool or
whatever<00:02:28.640> form<00:02:28.880> until<00:02:29.060> we<00:02:29.209> use<00:02:29.420> in<00:02:29.810> the<00:02:29.900> future

00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:30.050 
whatever form until we use in the future

00:02:30.050 --> 00:02:33.000 
whatever form until we use in the future
will<00:02:30.950> actually<00:02:31.310> change<00:02:31.610> this<00:02:32.090> part<00:02:32.450> as<00:02:32.599> well

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:33.010 
will actually change this part as well

00:02:33.010 --> 00:02:36.370 
will actually change this part as well
and<00:02:34.010> we<00:02:34.100> can<00:02:34.250> unselect<00:02:34.549> that<00:02:34.819> if<00:02:34.910> we<00:02:35.030> want<00:02:35.380> so

00:02:36.370 --> 00:02:36.380 
and we can unselect that if we want so

00:02:36.380 --> 00:02:38.490 
and we can unselect that if we want so
I'm<00:02:36.470> going<00:02:36.500> to<00:02:36.650> go<00:02:37.069> ahead<00:02:37.100> and<00:02:37.370> accept<00:02:37.610> that

00:02:41.289 --> 00:02:41.299 
and you can see here we've added all

00:02:41.299 --> 00:02:44.470 
and you can see here we've added all
those<00:02:41.480> louvers<00:02:41.840> and<00:02:42.760> let's<00:02:43.760> say<00:02:43.970> we<00:02:44.209> decide

00:02:44.470 --> 00:02:44.480 
those louvers and let's say we decide

00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:47.140 
those louvers and let's say we decide
well<00:02:44.810> we<00:02:44.959> want<00:02:45.140> to<00:02:45.230> add<00:02:45.319> a<00:02:45.590> third<00:02:46.040> row<00:02:46.280> now<00:02:47.090> we

00:02:47.140 --> 00:02:47.150 
well we want to add a third row now we

00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:50.050 
well we want to add a third row now we
can<00:02:47.450> actually<00:02:47.950> go<00:02:48.950> ahead<00:02:49.010> and<00:02:49.130> edit<00:02:49.400> that

00:02:50.050 --> 00:02:50.060 
can actually go ahead and edit that

00:02:50.060 --> 00:02:52.839 
can actually go ahead and edit that
louver<00:02:50.450> which<00:02:50.750> was<00:02:51.220> unavailable<00:02:52.220> in<00:02:52.459> previous

00:02:52.839 --> 00:02:52.849 
louver which was unavailable in previous

00:02:52.849 --> 00:02:56.880 
louver which was unavailable in previous
versions<00:02:53.000> and<00:02:53.959> Gavin<00:02:54.349> go<00:02:54.500> two<00:02:54.560> petitions<00:02:55.069> and

00:02:56.880 --> 00:02:56.890 
versions and Gavin go two petitions and

00:02:56.890 --> 00:03:01.300 
versions and Gavin go two petitions and
we<00:02:57.890> can<00:02:58.130> modify<00:02:59.120> the<00:03:00.110> linear<00:03:00.470> pattern<00:03:00.980> here

00:03:01.300 --> 00:03:01.310 
we can modify the linear pattern here

00:03:01.310 --> 00:03:13.730 
we can modify the linear pattern here
we'll<00:03:01.760> just<00:03:01.970> add<00:03:02.209> a<00:03:02.650> third<00:03:03.650> row

00:03:13.730 --> 00:03:13.740 

00:03:13.740 --> 00:03:18.620 

and<00:03:14.670> set<00:03:15.330> that<00:03:15.710> and<00:03:16.710> now<00:03:16.920> we<00:03:16.980> have<00:03:17.360> three<00:03:18.360> rows

00:03:18.620 --> 00:03:18.630 
and set that and now we have three rows

00:03:18.630 --> 00:03:24.170 
and set that and now we have three rows
of<00:03:18.870> those<00:03:19.050> louvers<00:03:19.290> and<00:03:21.560> an<00:03:22.560> even<00:03:22.890> further<00:03:23.180> now

00:03:24.170 --> 00:03:24.180 
of those louvers and an even further now

00:03:24.180 --> 00:03:25.790 
of those louvers and an even further now
in<00:03:24.360> 2012<00:03:24.540> since<00:03:25.050> we<00:03:25.170> are<00:03:25.290> allowed<00:03:25.500> to<00:03:25.530> edit

00:03:25.790 --> 00:03:25.800 
in 2012 since we are allowed to edit

00:03:30.110 --> 00:03:30.120 
that forming tool we can even go ahead

00:03:30.120 --> 00:03:33.370 
that forming tool we can even go ahead
