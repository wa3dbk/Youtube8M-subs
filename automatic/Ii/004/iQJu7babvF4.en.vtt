00:00:10.549 --> 00:00:12.749

00:00:12.749 --> 00:00:15.029
 born in michigan 

00:00:15.029 --> 00:00:19.029
 we want to give to our roots and at the same time they project us 

00:00:20.890 --> 00:00:24.329
 it does not seem to me 

00:00:24.329 --> 00:00:26.980

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:55.350

 that through this one all run 

00:01:43.050 --> 00:01:46.400
 have seen today inaugurated the craft complex 

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:49.410
 this magnificent project 

00:01:49.410 --> 00:01:51.270
 it works in its essence 

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:53.390
 the driver of modernity 

00:01:53.390 --> 00:01:56.450
 with the unique magic of craft identity 

00:01:56.970 --> 00:01:59.740
 to offer a first-class option 

00:01:59.740 --> 00:02:02.330
 not only for those who visit our state 

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:05.850
 but for those who have decided to make this their new home 

00:02:06.660 --> 00:02:08.639
 the broken craft complex 

00:02:08.639 --> 00:02:11.609
 is a clear example of how in Guanajuato 

00:02:11.609 --> 00:02:17.180
 the charm of our past merges with the competitiveness of the present for 

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:20.180
 make tourism the engine 

00:02:21.429 --> 00:02:26.939
 so much love in the past year when duck received 19 million visitors from 

00:02:26.939 --> 00:02:29.039
 them 3 million tourists 

00:02:29.039 --> 00:02:30.419
 artisan rock 

00:02:30.419 --> 00:02:32.029
 it shows 

00:02:32.029 --> 00:02:33.739
 and it shows 

00:02:33.739 --> 00:02:37.369
 Investors' confidence in the tourist potential of Guanajuato 

00:02:38.149 --> 00:02:41.129
 It is a clear sign 

00:02:41.129 --> 00:02:44.059
 with the hand of businessmen and government 

00:02:44.059 --> 00:02:45.979
 we transform to Guanajuato 

00:02:45.979 --> 00:02:48.159
 leading to every corner of the state 

00:02:48.159 --> 00:02:51.620
 the seed of the progrés and the opportunities that feed the 

00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:53.789
 development of our communities 

00:02:53.789 --> 00:02:55.529
 this hit when falling 

00:02:55.529 --> 00:03:00.699
 morally Guanajuato finally in San Miguel de Allende on hold we want is 

00:03:00.699 --> 00:03:02.329
 the city 

00:03:02.329 --> 00:03:03.230
 recognized 

00:03:03.230 --> 00:03:06.730
 by UNESCO as a cultural heritage of humanity 

00:03:07.259 --> 00:03:10.459
 fortun orb architectural wealth and of course we will be fine 

00:03:11.129 --> 00:03:12.269
 the Mexicans 

00:03:12.269 --> 00:03:15.499
 it happens that attitude 

00:03:15.499 --> 00:03:17.949
 the above to strengthen 

00:03:17.949 --> 00:03:20.049
 to san miguel de allende 

00:03:20.049 --> 00:03:23.209
 as one of the most recognized tourist destinations in Mexico 

00:03:24.069 --> 00:03:27.069
 and one of the preferred international visitors 

00:03:29.269 --> 00:03:33.249
 the history of san miguel de allende is a good part a porter of the 

00:03:33.249 --> 00:03:36.719
 history after trying to sell and as we know 

00:03:36.719 --> 00:03:39.149
 and captures ignacio allende 

00:03:39.149 --> 00:03:40.019
 prepared 

00:03:40.019 --> 00:03:43.019
 what the insurrection would be depends 

00:03:44.879 --> 00:03:47.249
 as the tourism secretary said 

00:03:47.249 --> 00:03:50.709
 decreed that 2011 is the year of tourism for me 

00:03:51.889 --> 00:03:53.789
 the purpose is clear 

00:03:53.789 --> 00:03:57.169
 and is that we propose to strengthen this strategic sector 

00:03:58.079 --> 00:04:01.159
 as one of the engines of national development 

00:04:01.159 --> 00:04:04.379
 but he celebrated that we are here together today 

00:04:04.379 --> 00:04:06.269
 to inaugurate the hotel golf cup 

00:04:06.269 --> 00:04:09.399
 and residences crafts Moscow 

00:04:09.399 --> 00:04:14.049
 and with juanjo artero attack a beautiful resort a class complex 

00:04:14.049 --> 00:04:15.409
 world 

00:04:15.409 --> 00:04:18.489
 which extends the reasons not only to visit 

00:04:19.139 --> 00:04:22.289
 san miguel de allende without a guanajuato general 

00:04:22.289 --> 00:04:23.759
 and the Mexican shoal 

00:04:23.759 --> 00:04:25.529
 a club 

00:04:25.529 --> 00:04:28.949
 for one of the most important tourist areas of the country 

00:04:30.930 --> 00:04:32.010
 different 

00:04:32.010 --> 00:04:34.599
 sun and beach destinations 

00:04:34.599 --> 00:04:37.340
 a tourism that has to do with what we are 

00:04:37.340 --> 00:04:39.360
 the Mexicans 

00:04:39.360 --> 00:04:40.759
 I like the motto 

00:04:40.759 --> 00:04:42.439
 of the moduc 

00:04:42.439 --> 00:04:45.809
 census then 

00:04:45.809 --> 00:04:47.819
 so we can say 

00:04:47.819 --> 00:04:50.819
 that this is the penalty applied to mexico 

00:04:51.539 --> 00:04:54.699
 because you do not really have to have many places mutism 

00:04:56.069 --> 00:04:59.259
 out of any pretense of modesty the best places in the world 

00:05:00.689 --> 00:05:04.620
 but more than the places and the beaches and the natural destinations the zones 

00:05:04.619 --> 00:05:07.620
 archaeological and colonial cities 

00:05:07.620 --> 00:05:09.930
 the best thing about mexico is 

00:05:09.930 --> 00:05:12.339
 the feeling of the place 

00:05:12.339 --> 00:05:15.129
 that only people can give 

00:05:15.129 --> 00:05:17.159
 because being in Mexico 

00:05:17.159 --> 00:05:18.819
 and with the Mexicans 

00:05:18.819 --> 00:05:21.309
 in experience scene 

00:05:21.309 --> 00:05:22.650
 some experiences 

00:05:22.650 --> 00:05:24.949
 I have to encourage tourism 

00:05:24.949 --> 00:05:27.080
 national india 

00:05:27.080 --> 00:05:28.979
 he argued that this development 

00:05:28.979 --> 00:05:32.119
 gentlemen investors for the fruits that you expect 

00:05:33.569 --> 00:05:37.199
 and that tourist complex is also important for people in San Miguel 

00:05:37.199 --> 00:05:38.229
 from allende 

00:05:38.229 --> 00:05:41.629
 It generated almost a thousand jobs during its construction 

00:05:41.629 --> 00:05:46.169
 and will offer permanent work to 300 guanajuatenses 

00:05:46.169 --> 00:05:48.809
 i with indirect jobs maybe 

00:05:48.809 --> 00:05:50.960
 with humiliation 

00:05:50.960 --> 00:05:54.220
 It is very satisfying to know that the passers-by will buy here 

00:05:54.909 --> 00:05:57.909
 magnificent rooms to stay 

00:05:58.409 --> 00:06:02.669
 but the most beautiful residences a space for events that is precisely 

00:06:02.669 --> 00:06:04.439
 where we are 

00:06:04.439 --> 00:06:07.270
 and that I am sure will be very much requested Andean 

00:06:07.270 --> 00:06:09.789
 unap and open air theater 

00:06:09.789 --> 00:06:12.789
 visitors will have a very pleasant place to rest 

00:06:13.360 --> 00:06:16.850
 and know the multiple attractions of this great city 

00:06:17.479 --> 00:06:18.830
 what is favorite 

00:06:18.830 --> 00:06:22.480
 in fact international tourists particularly from the america
