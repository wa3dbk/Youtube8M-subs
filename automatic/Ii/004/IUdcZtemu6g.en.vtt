00:00:03.210 --> 00:00:04.820
 good numbers 

00:00:04.820 --> 00:00:07.820
 Let's go slowly and welcome here the place 

00:00:08.869 --> 00:00:10.609
 currently 

00:00:10.609 --> 00:00:13.609
 satisfied the number of visits was getting 

00:00:16.209 --> 00:00:18.269
 the parade 

00:00:18.269 --> 00:00:21.269
 intention is only it can complicate even 

00:00:22.009 --> 00:00:25.310
 which we always have difficulty having 

00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:26.380
 the knowledge 

00:00:26.380 --> 00:00:28.109
 the singer who has the doctor 

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:31.380
 Your the one is the ex-doctor year 

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:33.900
 It's very different from the others. 

00:00:33.900 --> 00:00:36.900
 elisha areco light 

00:00:37.990 --> 00:00:40.990
 but now let's go 

00:00:40.990 --> 00:00:43.390
 show you 

00:00:43.390 --> 00:00:46.390
 How do we free up phone memory? 

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:49.080
 when we lowered 

00:00:49.080 --> 00:00:50.640
 from Internet 

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:54.150
 by automatic mode or there were some sites right 

00:00:54.970 --> 00:00:56.930
 epic assets 

00:00:56.930 --> 00:01:00.250
 these applications they go straight into the phone memory 

00:01:01.150 --> 00:01:04.100
 and our small memory as you already know 

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:07.100
 it's only 150 megabytes 

00:01:08.080 --> 00:01:11.080
 end up messing up 

00:01:11.620 --> 00:01:14.620
 or 

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:19.340
 now it's messing up 

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:22.750
 the processing speed of what to complain 

00:01:22.750 --> 00:01:24.060
 r 

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:25.460
 chloris 

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:27.600
 How do we have the card? 

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:28.770
 jk 

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:32.050
 d2 of templates 

00:01:32.050 --> 00:01:33.540
 chloris 

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:36.540
 we can put this year I made some of these applications 

00:01:38.440 --> 00:01:40.650
 we can copy them to the card 

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:43.840
 and then free space for garden 

00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:46.120
 How do we do this? 

00:01:46.120 --> 00:01:49.510
 simple 

00:01:49.510 --> 00:01:52.510
 putting the agreement 

00:01:53.740 --> 00:01:56.690
 It's good that it's a screen like you have 

00:01:56.690 --> 00:01:59.690
 We're going to give that left button 

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:03.840
 I realize why the left 

00:02:05.770 --> 00:02:07.110
 a chanel 

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:09.569
 and there we have 

00:02:09.569 --> 00:02:12.059
 in that of several functions 

00:02:12.059 --> 00:02:15.059
 we did not know 

00:02:15.759 --> 00:02:18.759
 manage applications to the global crisis 

00:02:21.889 --> 00:02:24.889
 and it's this app 

00:02:26.279 --> 00:02:28.639
 You are what I wanted. 

00:02:28.639 --> 00:02:31.639
 another dream 

00:02:35.989 --> 00:02:38.789
 you will have some options 

00:02:38.789 --> 00:02:41.789
 on the part of the host uol that those who received them 

00:02:43.479 --> 00:02:45.959
 You will have 

00:02:45.959 --> 00:02:47.889
 the applications 

00:02:47.889 --> 00:02:49.559
 are telephone 

00:02:49.559 --> 00:02:50.929
 the applications 

00:02:50.929 --> 00:02:53.279
 into account the success in the card 

00:02:53.279 --> 00:02:55.319
 president 

00:02:55.319 --> 00:02:58.319
 those who are pregnant and position 

00:02:59.889 --> 00:03:01.070
 this sometimes 

00:03:01.070 --> 00:03:04.070
 are running 

00:03:07.249 --> 00:03:09.299
 We're going to damous 

00:03:09.299 --> 00:03:12.299
 which is where they get a passion for the internet 

00:03:13.949 --> 00:03:16.889
 save the carnival with the application you 

00:03:16.889 --> 00:03:18.599
 I visualized 

00:03:18.599 --> 00:03:20.879
 File opened a screen 

00:03:20.879 --> 00:03:23.879
 of options where you can do 

00:03:24.539 --> 00:03:26.229
 dare 

00:03:26.229 --> 00:03:28.919
 the interruption of the party to settle 

00:03:28.919 --> 00:03:31.049
 off since captive 

00:03:31.049 --> 00:03:33.629
 and listen to this app 

00:03:33.629 --> 00:03:36.829
 creative in your phone's memory 

00:03:37.669 --> 00:03:40.930
 he will still be asking to be 

00:03:42.429 --> 00:03:44.279
 the memory card 

00:03:44.279 --> 00:03:47.509
 is on the memory card it goes from the 

00:03:48.059 --> 00:03:50.749
 to send this application back 

00:03:50.749 --> 00:03:53.749
 for the court reformed 

00:03:55.189 --> 00:03:57.349
 if you have a phone 

00:03:57.349 --> 00:04:00.629
 the option of stadium bugrino for memory card and backpack 

00:04:01.669 --> 00:04:04.869
 expectation was for memory card thus releasing 

00:04:06.959 --> 00:04:09.959
 the memory of the group to 

00:04:11.499 --> 00:04:14.069
 that it being reduced and corn wheat 

00:04:14.069 --> 00:04:15.560
 stay here in your field 

00:04:15.560 --> 00:04:17.259
 upper left 

00:04:17.259 --> 00:04:20.639
 everything will go away if it's going to start 

00:04:20.639 --> 00:04:23.279
 freedom to celebrate 

00:04:23.279 --> 00:04:26.479
 good as evil card 

00:04:26.479 --> 00:04:29.479
 mardy fish and you will have this program 

00:04:32.529 --> 00:04:34.419
 good eyes 

00:04:34.419 --> 00:04:37.219
 about memory 

00:04:37.219 --> 00:04:39.999
 we already are 

00:04:39.999 --> 00:04:40.829
 explained
