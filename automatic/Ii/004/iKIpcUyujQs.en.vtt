00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:38.010 

the<00:01:35.680> only<00:01:35.830> disadvantage<00:01:36.370> I<00:01:37.180> would<00:01:37.450> say<00:01:37.660> for

00:01:38.010 --> 00:01:38.020 
the only disadvantage I would say for

00:01:38.020 --> 00:01:45.090 
the only disadvantage I would say for
this<00:01:38.140> pie<00:01:38.530> is<00:01:39.480> the<00:01:42.840> petrol<00:01:43.840> cap<00:01:44.260> wherever<00:01:45.010> it

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:45.100 
this pie is the petrol cap wherever it

00:01:45.100 --> 00:01:53.730 
this pie is the petrol cap wherever it
is<00:01:45.250> which<00:01:45.880> is<00:01:48.750> just<00:01:50.550> things<00:01:51.550> kind<00:01:52.150> of<00:01:52.590> slants<00:01:53.590> a

00:01:53.730 --> 00:01:53.740 
is which is just things kind of slants a

00:01:53.740 --> 00:01:56.640 
is which is just things kind of slants a
go<00:01:53.950> so<00:01:54.490> you<00:01:54.580> can't<00:01:54.850> really<00:01:55.200> get<00:01:56.200> up<00:01:56.380> all<00:01:56.560> the

00:01:56.640 --> 00:01:56.650 
go so you can't really get up all the

00:01:56.650 --> 00:01:59.940 
go so you can't really get up all the
way<00:01:56.740> to<00:01:56.800> the<00:01:56.980> top<00:01:57.220> so<00:01:57.550> you<00:01:58.480> have<00:01:59.350> to<00:01:59.590> cut<00:01:59.800> be

00:01:59.940 --> 00:01:59.950 
way to the top so you have to cut be

00:01:59.950 --> 00:02:03.000 
way to the top so you have to cut be
careful<00:02:00.490> so<00:02:00.790> you<00:02:01.200> have<00:02:02.200> a<00:02:02.350> throw<00:02:02.590> it<00:02:02.740> and<00:02:02.890> it

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:03.010 
careful so you have a throw it and it

00:02:03.010 --> 00:02:11.260 
careful so you have a throw it and it
comes<00:02:03.070> up<00:02:03.430> when<00:02:03.580> you<00:02:03.700> ride<00:02:03.910> in<00:02:05.460> yeah

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:11.270
