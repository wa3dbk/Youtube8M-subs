00:04:36.539 --> 00:04:39.050 
unfortunate all our stuff would be out
on<00:04:36.570> the<00:04:36.750> floor<00:04:36.960> and<00:04:37.560> if<00:04:38.070> like<00:04:38.550> they're<00:04:38.699> all<00:04:38.820> the

00:04:39.050 --> 00:04:39.060 
on the floor and if like they're all the

00:04:39.060 --> 00:04:40.760 
on the floor and if like they're all the
same<00:04:39.090> item<00:04:39.539> number<00:04:39.570> on<00:04:39.840> our<00:04:39.990> website<00:04:40.470> so<00:04:40.740> that

00:04:40.760 --> 00:04:40.770 
same item number on our website so that

00:04:40.770 --> 00:04:42.590 
same item number on our website so that
it's<00:04:41.070> not<00:04:41.190> that<00:04:41.340> they're<00:04:41.460> all<00:04:41.550> this<00:04:41.699> so<00:04:42.419> let's

00:04:42.590 --> 00:04:42.600 
it's not that they're all this so let's

00:04:42.600 --> 00:04:44.210 
it's not that they're all this so let's
say<00:04:42.750> we<00:04:42.780> have<00:04:43.080> it<00:04:43.199> all<00:04:43.289> on<00:04:43.350> the<00:04:43.560> floor<00:04:43.770> these

00:04:44.210 --> 00:04:44.220 
say we have it all on the floor these

00:04:44.220 --> 00:04:45.680 
say we have it all on the floor these
are<00:04:44.310> the<00:04:44.400> same<00:04:44.520> numbers<00:04:44.820> that<00:04:44.970> make<00:04:45.090> sense<00:04:45.300> so

00:04:45.680 --> 00:04:45.690 
are the same numbers that make sense so

00:04:45.690 --> 00:05:08.370 
are the same numbers that make sense so
what<00:04:45.900> we<00:04:45.990> have<00:04:46.169> it<00:04:46.259> be<00:04:46.350> over<00:04:46.470> there
