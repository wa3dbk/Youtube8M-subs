a<00:01:05.339> minute<00:01:06.090> I<00:01:06.240> remember<00:01:06.390> playing<00:01:06.990> this<00:01:07.170> game

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:07.260 
a minute I remember playing this game

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:09.890 
a minute I remember playing this game
two<00:01:07.590> years<00:01:07.619> ago<00:01:08.100> and<00:01:08.729> so<00:01:08.939> I<00:01:09.119> mentioned<00:01:09.689> this

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:09.900 
two years ago and so I mentioned this

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:11.630 
two years ago and so I mentioned this
because<00:01:10.080> while<00:01:10.920> the<00:01:11.100> run-through<00:01:11.250> I<00:01:11.400> think

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:11.640 
because while the run-through I think

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:13.310 
because while the run-through I think
did<00:01:11.760> a<00:01:11.820> pretty<00:01:12.000> good<00:01:12.150> job<00:01:12.210> of<00:01:12.510> showing<00:01:12.840> the<00:01:13.170> you

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:13.320 
did a pretty good job of showing the you

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:14.600

know how all the basic stuff works and

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:16.190

how<00:01:14.670> the<00:01:14.729> flow<00:01:14.909> works<00:01:15.270> the<00:01:15.840> one<00:01:15.960> thing<00:01:16.110> I

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:16.200

00:01:57.469 --> 00:01:57.479 
burial pile because you have so many

00:01:57.479 --> 00:01:59.480 
burial pile because you have so many
ways<00:01:57.840> that<00:01:58.380> these<00:01:58.530> cards<00:01:58.950> can<00:01:59.070> interact<00:01:59.399> I

00:01:59.480 --> 00:01:59.490 
ways that these cards can interact I

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:01.429 
ways that these cards can interact I
mean<00:01:59.610> every<00:01:59.909> card<00:02:00.149> in<00:02:00.240> this<00:02:00.329> game<00:02:00.570> has<00:02:01.140> like

00:02:01.429 --> 00:02:01.439 
mean every card in this game has like

00:02:01.439 --> 00:02:03.380 
mean every card in this game has like
three<00:02:01.710> or<00:02:01.829> four<00:02:01.890> key<00:02:02.280> words<00:02:02.520> on<00:02:02.759> it<00:02:02.909> and<00:02:03.060> there

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:03.390 
three or four key words on it and there

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:05.060 
three or four key words on it and there
are<00:02:03.479> so<00:02:03.630> many<00:02:03.719> cards<00:02:04.049> that<00:02:04.200> say<00:02:04.350> all<00:02:04.619> cards

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:05.070 
are so many cards that say all cards

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:06.530 
are so many cards that say all cards
with<00:02:05.310> this<00:02:05.460> key<00:02:05.640> word<00:02:05.790> or<00:02:05.939> that<00:02:06.119> key<00:02:06.299> word<00:02:06.450> or

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:06.540 
with this key word or that key word or

with this key word or that key word or
that<00:02:06.719> key<00:02:06.899> word<00:02:07.049> and<00:02:07.259> that's<00:02:07.649> really<00:02:08.129> the<00:02:08.369> crux

00:02:08.510 --> 00:02:08.520 
that key word and that's really the crux

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:10.330 
that key word and that's really the crux
of<00:02:08.670> what<00:02:08.819> this<00:02:08.910> game<00:02:09.090> is<00:02:09.119> all<00:02:09.330> about<00:02:09.390> now<00:02:09.690> I

00:02:10.330 --> 00:02:10.340 
of what this game is all about now I

00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:12.380 
of what this game is all about now I
mentioned<00:02:11.340> again<00:02:11.489> songs<00:02:11.790> of<00:02:11.940> artha<00:02:12.060> because

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:12.390 
mentioned again songs of artha because

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:14.330 
mentioned again songs of artha because
if<00:02:12.480> you<00:02:12.569> want<00:02:12.840> there's<00:02:13.290> a<00:02:13.440> link<00:02:13.620> right<00:02:13.650> there

00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:14.340 
if you want there's a link right there

00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:16.309 
if you want there's a link right there
you<00:02:14.580> can<00:02:14.760> go<00:02:14.910> watch<00:02:15.180> the<00:02:15.510> run-through<00:02:15.720> I<00:02:15.930> did

00:02:16.309 --> 00:02:16.319 
you can go watch the run-through I did

00:02:16.319 --> 00:02:17.930 
you can go watch the run-through I did
four<00:02:16.590> songs<00:02:16.769> of<00:02:16.950> artha<00:02:17.129> it<00:02:17.310> was<00:02:17.400> a<00:02:17.459> very<00:02:17.640> quick

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:17.940 
four songs of artha it was a very quick

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:19.610 
four songs of artha it was a very quick
one<00:02:18.090> just<00:02:18.330> went<00:02:18.510> through<00:02:18.599> like<00:02:18.780> a<00:02:18.810> one<00:02:19.410> or<00:02:19.530> two

00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:19.620 
one just went through like a one or two

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:21.830 
one just went through like a one or two
rounds<00:02:19.739> of<00:02:19.950> combat<00:02:20.370> and<00:02:20.670> I<00:02:21.209> think<00:02:21.450> it<00:02:21.569> showed

00:02:21.830 --> 00:02:21.840 
rounds of combat and I think it showed

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:24.020 
rounds of combat and I think it showed
some<00:02:22.260> of<00:02:22.290> the<00:02:22.410> really<00:02:22.739> cool<00:02:23.030> combinatorial

00:02:24.020 --> 00:02:24.030 
some of the really cool combinatorial

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:25.490 
some of the really cool combinatorial
things<00:02:24.060> that<00:02:24.540> I<00:02:24.569> didn't<00:02:24.989> necessarily<00:02:25.050> show

00:02:25.490 --> 00:02:25.500 
things that I didn't necessarily show

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:27.140 
things that I didn't necessarily show
very<00:02:25.800> well<00:02:25.980> in<00:02:26.099> this<00:02:26.220> run-through<00:02:26.430> because<00:02:27.060> I

00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:27.150 
very well in this run-through because I

00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:28.280 
very well in this run-through because I
was<00:02:27.269> still<00:02:27.450> kind<00:02:27.720> of<00:02:27.750> at<00:02:27.870> the<00:02:27.930> beginning<00:02:28.170> of

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:28.290 
was still kind of at the beginning of

00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:29.330 
was still kind of at the beginning of
the<00:02:28.349> game<00:02:28.470> and<00:02:28.650> I<00:02:28.680> was<00:02:28.739> fighting<00:02:29.010> some<00:02:29.129> really

00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:29.340 
the game and I was fighting some really

00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:30.949 
the game and I was fighting some really
weak<00:02:29.459> enemies<00:02:29.849> so<00:02:30.330> if<00:02:30.390> you<00:02:30.480> want<00:02:30.660> to<00:02:30.720> get<00:02:30.840> an

00:02:30.949 --> 00:02:30.959 
weak enemies so if you want to get an

00:02:30.959 --> 00:02:32.600 
weak enemies so if you want to get an
idea<00:02:31.019> for<00:02:31.349> what<00:02:31.680> this<00:02:31.769> game<00:02:31.980> is<00:02:32.099> like<00:02:32.220> at<00:02:32.459> the

00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:32.610 
idea for what this game is like at the

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:34.820 
idea for what this game is like at the
higher<00:02:32.849> levels<00:02:33.390> when<00:02:33.780> it<00:02:33.900> really<00:02:34.470> starts

00:02:34.820 --> 00:02:34.830 
higher levels when it really starts

00:02:34.830 --> 00:02:36.589 
higher levels when it really starts
clicking<00:02:35.340> go<00:02:35.849> check<00:02:36.120> that<00:02:36.330> out

00:02:36.589 --> 00:02:36.599 
clicking go check that out

00:02:36.599 --> 00:02:39.979 
clicking go check that out
but<00:02:37.019> anyway<00:02:37.700> otherwise<00:02:38.700> um<00:02:39.030> what<00:02:39.720> can<00:02:39.810> I<00:02:39.870> say

missed fall is a very long game I mean

00:03:39.389 --> 00:03:41.660

heck<00:03:39.510> the<00:03:39.630> box<00:03:39.870> proudly<00:03:40.440> proclaims<00:03:40.920> oh<00:03:41.280> this

00:03:41.660 --> 00:03:41.670 
heck the box proudly proclaims oh this

00:03:41.670 --> 00:03:43.039 
heck the box proudly proclaims oh this
is<00:03:41.790> a<00:03:41.819> prototype<00:03:42.209> box<00:03:42.480> so<00:03:42.599> if<00:03:42.690> proclaim<00:03:42.930> is

00:03:43.039 --> 00:03:43.049 
is a prototype box so if proclaim is

00:03:43.049 --> 00:03:45.650 
is a prototype box so if proclaim is
nothing<00:03:43.349> but<00:03:43.769> I<00:03:43.829> believe<00:03:44.280> the<00:03:44.849> default<00:03:45.389> length

00:03:45.650 --> 00:03:45.660 
nothing but I believe the default length

00:03:45.660 --> 00:03:48.289 
nothing but I believe the default length
that<00:03:46.230> the<00:03:46.410> Box<00:03:46.590> says<00:03:46.859> is<00:03:47.099> two<00:03:47.340> hours<00:03:47.549> and<00:03:48.120> I

00:03:48.289 --> 00:03:48.299 
that the Box says is two hours and I

00:03:48.299 --> 00:03:50.030 
that the Box says is two hours and I
could<00:03:48.450> certainly<00:03:48.599> see<00:03:48.810> it<00:03:49.019> going<00:03:49.200> longer<00:03:49.560> now

00:03:50.030 --> 00:03:50.040 
could certainly see it going longer now

00:03:50.040 --> 00:03:51.530 
could certainly see it going longer now
it<00:03:50.190> does<00:03:50.370> come<00:03:50.579> with<00:03:50.609> the<00:03:50.790> shorter<00:03:51.120> adventure

00:03:51.530 --> 00:03:51.540

that's<00:07:27.780> Jen's<00:07:28.020> in<00:07:28.140> my<00:07:28.230> problem<00:07:28.590> we<00:07:28.680> just<00:07:28.860> don't

00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:29.010 
that's Jen's in my problem we just don't

00:07:29.010 --> 00:07:30.590 
that's Jen's in my problem we just don't
like<00:07:29.130> co-op<00:07:29.460> games<00:07:29.700> that<00:07:29.910> take<00:07:30.120> two<00:07:30.360> plus

00:07:30.590 --> 00:07:30.600 
like co-op games that take two plus

00:07:30.600 --> 00:07:32.600 
like co-op games that take two plus
hours<00:07:30.750> because<00:07:31.470> the<00:07:31.680> co-op<00:07:32.340> game<00:07:32.490> like

00:07:32.600 --> 00:07:32.610 
hours because the co-op game like

00:07:32.610 --> 00:07:34.820 
hours because the co-op game like
pandemic<00:07:33.090> that<00:07:33.180> we<00:07:33.300> can<00:07:33.480> finish<00:07:33.660> win<00:07:34.290> or<00:07:34.560> lose

00:07:34.820 --> 00:07:34.830 
pandemic that we can finish win or lose

00:07:34.830 --> 00:07:36.170 
pandemic that we can finish win or lose
easily<00:07:35.430> in<00:07:35.520> under<00:07:35.790> an<00:07:35.880> hour

00:07:36.170 --> 00:07:36.180 
easily in under an hour

00:07:36.180 --> 00:07:38.060 
easily in under an hour
we<00:07:36.510> don't<00:07:36.660> mind<00:07:36.750> so<00:07:36.960> much<00:07:37.020> if<00:07:37.230> we<00:07:37.260> lose<00:07:37.530> but<00:07:37.950> if

00:07:38.060 --> 00:07:38.070 
we don't mind so much if we lose but if

00:07:38.070 --> 00:07:41.000 
we don't mind so much if we lose but if
we<00:07:38.220> play<00:07:38.520> for<00:07:38.820> two<00:07:39.000> or<00:07:39.360> three<00:07:39.720> hours<00:07:39.860> and<00:07:40.860> we

00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:41.010 
we play for two or three hours and we

00:07:41.010 --> 00:07:41.990 
we play for two or three hours and we
make<00:07:41.190> it<00:07:41.310> all<00:07:41.400> the<00:07:41.430> way<00:07:41.490> up<00:07:41.550> to<00:07:41.670> the<00:07:41.760> end<00:07:41.850> and

00:07:41.990 --> 00:07:42.000 
make it all the way up to the end and

00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:43.460 
make it all the way up to the end and
then<00:07:42.090> we<00:07:42.210> lose<00:07:42.360> all<00:07:42.570> that's<00:07:42.870> crushing<00:07:43.170> that's

00:07:43.460 --> 00:07:43.470 
then we lose all that's crushing that's

00:07:43.470 --> 00:07:44.930 
then we lose all that's crushing that's
devastating<00:07:43.950> so<00:07:44.100> it's<00:07:44.520> just<00:07:44.670> something<00:07:44.880> to

00:07:44.930 --> 00:07:44.940 
devastating so it's just something to

00:07:44.940 --> 00:07:47.090 
devastating so it's just something to
bear<00:07:45.060> in<00:07:45.120> mind<00:07:45.210> but<00:07:45.900> again<00:07:46.200> who<00:07:46.650> cares<00:07:46.920> what

00:07:47.090 --> 00:07:47.100 
bear in mind but again who cares what

00:07:47.100 --> 00:07:49.040 
bear in mind but again who cares what
Jen<00:07:47.250> I<00:07:47.370> think<00:07:47.580> hopefully<00:07:47.820> between<00:07:48.570> this

00:07:49.040 --> 00:07:49.050 
Jen I think hopefully between this

00:07:49.050 --> 00:07:50.630 
Jen I think hopefully between this
