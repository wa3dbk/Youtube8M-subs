00:00:01.490 --> 00:00:01.500 
hey guys I wanted to take a look at the

00:00:01.500 --> 00:00:03.590 
hey guys I wanted to take a look at the
display<00:00:01.740> control<00:00:02.370> app<00:00:02.550> from<00:00:02.790> Franco<00:00:03.270> now<00:00:03.449> this

00:00:03.590 --> 00:00:03.600 
display control app from Franco now this

00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:05.059 
display control app from Franco now this
is<00:00:03.720> gonna<00:00:03.840> allow<00:00:04.140> you<00:00:04.200> to<00:00:04.290> change<00:00:04.560> the<00:00:04.830> gamma

00:00:05.059 --> 00:00:05.069 
is gonna allow you to change the gamma

00:00:05.069 --> 00:00:06.769 
is gonna allow you to change the gamma
on<00:00:05.370> your<00:00:05.520> Nexus<00:00:05.850> 5<00:00:05.910> I<00:00:06.120> believe<00:00:06.299> it<00:00:06.660> also

00:00:06.769 --> 00:00:06.779 
on your Nexus 5 I believe it also

00:00:06.779 --> 00:00:09.560 
on your Nexus 5 I believe it also
supports<00:00:07.290> the<00:00:07.410> Nexus<00:00:07.710> 4<00:00:07.950> and<00:00:07.980> Galaxy<00:00:08.700> Nexus<00:00:08.849> it

00:00:09.560 --> 00:00:09.570 
supports the Nexus 4 and Galaxy Nexus it

00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:11.540 
supports the Nexus 4 and Galaxy Nexus it
does<00:00:09.870> obviously<00:00:10.440> require<00:00:10.769> a<00:00:10.980> compatible

00:00:11.540 --> 00:00:11.550 
does obviously require a compatible

00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:13.310 
does obviously require a compatible
custom<00:00:11.940> kernel<00:00:12.300> but<00:00:12.509> they<00:00:12.780> include<00:00:13.019> pretty

00:00:13.310 --> 00:00:13.320 
custom kernel but they include pretty

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:15.230 
custom kernel but they include pretty
much<00:00:13.500> all<00:00:13.650> the<00:00:13.769> big<00:00:13.889> ones<00:00:14.099> and<00:00:14.460> of<00:00:14.790> course<00:00:15.089> it

00:00:15.230 --> 00:00:15.240 
much all the big ones and of course it

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:17.120 
much all the big ones and of course it
does<00:00:15.389> include<00:00:15.690> the<00:00:15.839> latest<00:00:15.990> Franco<00:00:16.590> kernel<00:00:16.980> I

00:00:17.120 --> 00:00:17.130 
does include the latest Franco kernel I

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:19.099 
does include the latest Franco kernel I
checked<00:00:17.760> out<00:00:17.910> an<00:00:18.060> app<00:00:18.210> that<00:00:18.510> changed<00:00:19.020> the

00:00:19.099 --> 00:00:19.109 
checked out an app that changed the

00:00:19.109 --> 00:00:20.660 
checked out an app that changed the
gamma<00:00:19.289> last<00:00:19.619> week<00:00:19.859> but<00:00:20.039> it<00:00:20.160> didn't<00:00:20.369> work<00:00:20.520> with

00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:20.670 
gamma last week but it didn't work with

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:23.599 
gamma last week but it didn't work with
Franco<00:00:21.060> Colonel<00:00:21.390> this<00:00:21.689> one<00:00:21.960> does<00:00:22.260> so<00:00:23.100> if<00:00:23.490> we

00:01:24.689 --> 00:01:27.170 
you also have the white point brightness
as<00:01:24.930> well<00:01:25.200> so<00:01:25.890> this<00:01:26.130> is<00:01:26.310> a<00:01:26.340> lot<00:01:26.580> easier<00:01:27.000> to

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:27.180 
as well so this is a lot easier to

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:29.539 
as well so this is a lot easier to
customize<00:01:27.689> and<00:01:27.900> tweak<00:01:28.170> than<00:01:28.470> the<00:01:28.619> foe<00:01:29.220> app<00:01:29.400> I

00:01:29.539 --> 00:01:29.549 
customize and tweak than the foe app I

00:01:29.549 --> 00:01:30.950 
customize and tweak than the foe app I
tested<00:01:29.909> out<00:01:30.000> last<00:01:30.240> week<00:01:30.479> where<00:01:30.659> you<00:01:30.750> had<00:01:30.869> to

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:30.960 
tested out last week where you had to

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:33.050 
tested out last week where you had to
put<00:01:31.079> in<00:01:31.170> 30<00:01:31.470> individual<00:01:32.220> numbers<00:01:32.729> that<00:01:32.909> was

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:33.060 
put in 30 individual numbers that was

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:34.999 
put in 30 individual numbers that was
kind<00:01:33.390> of<00:01:33.450> a<00:01:33.509> lot<00:01:33.630> of<00:01:33.720> effort<00:01:34.020> this<00:01:34.590> is<00:01:34.770> a<00:01:34.799> lot

00:01:34.999 --> 00:01:35.009 
kind of a lot of effort this is a lot

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:37.130 
kind of a lot of effort this is a lot
easier<00:01:35.369> now<00:01:35.579> you'll<00:01:36.390> probably<00:01:36.540> still<00:01:36.840> need<00:01:37.020> to

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:37.140 
easier now you'll probably still need to

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:39.140 
easier now you'll probably still need to
download<00:01:37.350> and<00:01:37.799> install<00:01:37.950> the<00:01:38.400> display<00:01:38.790> tester

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:39.150 
download and install the display tester

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:40.520 
download and install the display tester
app<00:01:39.270> to<00:01:39.390> actually<00:01:39.509> see<00:01:39.840> what<00:01:39.990> you're<00:01:40.110> doing<00:01:40.409> to

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:40.530 
app to actually see what you're doing to

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:42.080 
app to actually see what you're doing to
your<00:01:40.619> display<00:01:40.950> to<00:01:40.979> tweak<00:01:41.369> it<00:01:41.520> to<00:01:41.640> exactly<00:01:41.909> how

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:42.090 
your display to tweak it to exactly how

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:44.300 
your display to tweak it to exactly how
you<00:01:42.270> like<00:01:42.540> but<00:01:43.110> in<00:01:43.200> all<00:01:43.320> honesty<00:01:43.710> I<00:01:43.740> end<00:01:44.130> up

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:44.310 
you like but in all honesty I end up

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:45.980 
you like but in all honesty I end up
just<00:01:44.579> using<00:01:44.850> the<00:01:45.119> profiles<00:01:45.570> and<00:01:45.810> some<00:01:45.930> of

00:01:45.980 --> 00:01:45.990 
just using the profiles and some of

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:47.330 
just using the profiles and some of
these<00:01:46.079> profiles<00:01:46.439> are<00:01:46.649> really<00:01:46.920> awesome<00:01:47.070> but

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:47.340 
these profiles are really awesome but

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:49.160 
these profiles are really awesome but
the<00:01:47.430> one<00:01:47.549> I'm<00:01:47.670> using<00:01:47.850> right<00:01:48.000> now<00:01:48.149> is<00:01:48.360> the<00:01:48.750> vomer

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:49.170 
the one I'm using right now is the vomer

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:52.609 
the one I'm using right now is the vomer
3<00:01:49.409> so<00:01:49.920> you<00:01:50.009> just<00:01:50.159> hit<00:01:50.310> that<00:01:50.369> hit<00:01:51.090> apply<00:01:51.619> turn

00:01:52.609 --> 00:01:52.619 
3 so you just hit that hit apply turn

00:01:52.619 --> 00:01:54.319 
3 so you just hit that hit apply turn
your<00:01:52.799> display<00:01:53.100> off<00:01:53.280> turn<00:01:53.670> it<00:01:53.700> back<00:01:53.939> on<00:01:53.970> for<00:01:54.270> it

00:01:54.319 --> 00:01:54.329 
your display off turn it back on for it

00:01:54.329 --> 00:01:55.010 
your display off turn it back on for it
to<00:01:54.390> take<00:01:54.570> effect

00:01:55.010 --> 00:01:55.020 
to take effect

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:56.539 
to take effect
and<00:01:55.110> one<00:01:55.259> thing<00:01:55.470> I<00:01:55.590> do<00:01:55.649> change<00:01:56.100> in<00:01:56.280> the<00:01:56.369> gamma

00:01:56.539 --> 00:01:56.549 
and one thing I do change in the gamma

00:01:56.549 --> 00:01:58.370 
and one thing I do change in the gamma
is<00:01:56.850> the<00:01:56.880> white<00:01:57.210> point<00:01:57.509> I<00:01:57.689> feel<00:01:57.840> like<00:01:57.899> lowering

00:01:58.370 --> 00:01:58.380 
is the white point I feel like lowering

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:00.050 
is the white point I feel like lowering
the<00:01:58.530> white<00:01:58.680> point<00:01:58.979> gives<00:01:59.250> me<00:01:59.460> a<00:01:59.490> little<00:01:59.880> bit<00:01:59.969> of

00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:00.060 
the white point gives me a little bit of

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:01.520 
the white point gives me a little bit of
a<00:02:00.119> darker<00:02:00.479> screen<00:02:00.750> and<00:02:00.960> makes<00:02:01.110> it<00:02:01.259> colors<00:02:01.500> a

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:01.530 
a darker screen and makes it colors a

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:03.709 
a darker screen and makes it colors a
little<00:02:01.680> bit<00:02:01.829> more<00:02:02.009> saturated<00:02:02.579> so<00:02:03.149> by<00:02:03.299> default

00:02:03.709 --> 00:02:03.719 
little bit more saturated so by default

00:02:03.719 --> 00:02:05.600 
little bit more saturated so by default
is<00:02:03.840> 32<00:02:04.320> I'm<00:02:04.469> just<00:02:04.619> gonna<00:02:04.770> pull<00:02:04.979> this<00:02:05.100> down<00:02:05.340> to

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:05.610 
is 32 I'm just gonna pull this down to

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:09.919 
is 32 I'm just gonna pull this down to
maybe<00:02:05.790> know<00:02:06.450> 28<00:02:06.950> turn<00:02:07.950> off<00:02:08.160> the<00:02:08.280> display<00:02:08.929> turn

00:02:09.919 --> 00:02:09.929 
maybe know 28 turn off the display turn

00:02:09.929 --> 00:02:10.339 
maybe know 28 turn off the display turn
it<00:02:10.020> back<00:02:10.140> on

00:02:10.339 --> 00:02:10.349 
it back on

00:02:10.349 --> 00:02:12.020 
it back on
and<00:02:10.590> it<00:02:10.770> definitely<00:02:10.950> looks<00:02:11.190> to<00:02:11.459> me<00:02:11.580> like<00:02:11.610> the

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:12.030 
and it definitely looks to me like the

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:13.550 
and it definitely looks to me like the
display<00:02:12.360> is<00:02:12.420> a<00:02:12.540> little<00:02:12.780> bit<00:02:12.870> more<00:02:12.989> saturated

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:13.560 
display is a little bit more saturated

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:13.940 
display is a little bit more saturated
now<00:02:13.680> and

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:13.950 
now and

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:15.740 
now and
that's<00:02:14.069> how<00:02:14.430> I<00:02:14.459> like<00:02:14.879> it<00:02:14.910> so<00:02:15.330> yeah<00:02:15.540> it's

00:02:15.740 --> 00:02:15.750 
that's how I like it so yeah it's

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:17.990 
that's how I like it so yeah it's
individual<00:02:16.379> it's<00:02:16.560> your<00:02:16.709> taste<00:02:17.010> what<00:02:17.670> you<00:02:17.700> like

00:02:17.990 --> 00:02:18.000 
individual it's your taste what you like

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:20.210 
individual it's your taste what you like
but<00:02:18.360> it's<00:02:18.780> definitely<00:02:19.230> a<00:02:19.260> lot<00:02:19.560> easier<00:02:19.950> to<00:02:20.069> use

00:02:20.210 --> 00:02:20.220 
but it's definitely a lot easier to use

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:22.160 
but it's definitely a lot easier to use
this<00:02:20.370> app<00:02:20.580> and<00:02:20.819> it<00:02:20.879> was<00:02:21.030> the<00:02:21.269> faux<00:02:21.629> display<00:02:22.050> app

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:22.170 
this app and it was the faux display app

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:24.680 
this app and it was the faux display app
that<00:02:22.319> we<00:02:22.410> tested<00:02:22.739> out<00:02:22.830> last<00:02:23.069> week<00:02:23.310> so<00:02:23.640> yeah<00:02:24.480> and

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:24.690 
that we tested out last week so yeah and

00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:26.270 
that we tested out last week so yeah and
of<00:02:24.840> course<00:02:25.050> it<00:02:25.200> works<00:02:25.410> on<00:02:25.590> the<00:02:25.650> franko<00:02:25.980> kernel

00:02:26.270 --> 00:02:26.280 
of course it works on the franko kernel

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:27.860 
of course it works on the franko kernel
which<00:02:26.400> I<00:02:26.519> know<00:02:26.580> a<00:02:26.670> lot<00:02:26.879> of<00:02:26.910> you<00:02:27.000> guys<00:02:27.150> use<00:02:27.540> so

which I know a lot of you guys use so

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:32.150 
which I know a lot of you guys use so
