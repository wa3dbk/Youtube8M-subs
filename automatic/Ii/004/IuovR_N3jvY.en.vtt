00:00:00.130 --> 00:00:05.860

00:00:03.069 --> 00:00:07.720
 meaning and today I bring you another tutorial in 

00:00:05.860 --> 00:00:09.820
 this tutorial what we're going to see we're going to 

00:00:07.720 --> 00:00:11.590
 Learn how to download and install world of 

00:00:09.820 --> 00:00:14.950
 warcraft and play on a private server 

00:00:11.590 --> 00:00:16.900
 for free, come on, let's get down to business 

00:00:14.950 --> 00:00:19.490
 work and the first thing we are going to do is 

00:00:16.900 --> 00:00:23.080
 go to this loading page 

00:00:19.490 --> 00:00:23.080
 I'll leave it in the description of 

00:00:23.360 --> 00:00:28.740
 the description of the video and we give here 

00:00:25.670 --> 00:00:33.529
 to pc or those that you have marc kaman 

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:33.529
 we go and I keep them because I already have 

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:40.840
 then we open this it will lower us this 

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:40.840
 let's egg we give 

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:43.460
 and we open it 

00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:50.570
 and we will let these three options 

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:52.970
 a lake and let down the facelift 

00:00:50.570 --> 00:00:54.740
 is dispensing I will tell how I'm going to 

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:57.740
 lower the skin if I do not have the other two 

00:00:54.740 --> 00:01:00.960
 the game and the other expansion because the 

00:00:57.740 --> 00:01:04.680
 lifting and everything is installed 

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:06.140
 when once you give this accept 

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:08.120
 I'm going to close 

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:10.580
 once given to accept to install 

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:14.060
 a mini installation of two minutes or 

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:16.340
 one depends on the connection and it is installed 

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:18.760
 We open this folder and we give it to 

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:18.760
 install 

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:30.530
 and this will come out 

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:30.530
 is the installation 

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:34.040
 ah 

00:01:43.250 --> 00:01:46.409
 [Music] 

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:53.670
 and here I get no play 

00:01:51.470 --> 00:01:55.470
 directly or uninstall 

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:58.320
 I get this because I already have it 

00:01:55.470 --> 00:01:59.580
 installed but you will be started 

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:02.550
 to install 

00:01:59.580 --> 00:02:04.710
 I'm going out and once installed you 

00:02:02.550 --> 00:02:07.500
 will open a very important egg thing 

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:10.140
 that thing close it as soon as 

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:12.930
 You can give it to close because if it is not going to 

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:14.910
 jump to the good card to the screen and 

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:16.760
 when the screen jumps you will have to 

00:02:14.910 --> 00:02:19.430
 do it all again 

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:21.890
 and that is a waste of time 

00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:24.319
 when we have the game installer 

00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:26.150
 let's install the patches there are two 

00:02:24.319 --> 00:02:29.490
 ways to install the patches the 

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:32.590
 fast and slow 

00:02:29.490 --> 00:02:35.260
 the slow one would come down one by one from here 

00:02:32.590 --> 00:02:35.740
 the quick one would be downloading from this 

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:38.320
 page 

00:02:35.740 --> 00:02:40.540
 load the walk-over launcher but 

00:02:38.320 --> 00:02:42.640
 it is not installed at all 

00:02:40.540 --> 00:02:45.710
 you open the good pitcher now what 

00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:49.120
 you will see what you open you leave it there 

00:02:45.710 --> 00:02:49.120
 a while as you want 

00:03:01.670 --> 00:03:04.240
 here 

00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:12.710
 give you here download pc me as I already 

00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:12.710
 I have not installed it 

00:03:14.819 --> 00:03:19.690
 week 

00:03:16.610 --> 00:03:19.690
 when they have downloaded it 

00:03:21.110 --> 00:03:28.830
 the folder you use installed and install 

00:03:25.660 --> 00:03:28.830
 the traces here 

00:03:36.560 --> 00:03:39.370
 we click 

00:04:07.970 --> 00:04:12.330
 I get to play directly because 

00:04:10.580 --> 00:04:15.030
 I have 

00:04:12.330 --> 00:04:18.360
 but to you it will begin to walk us 

00:04:15.030 --> 00:04:20.820
 you leave there and when it's finished patching you 

00:04:18.360 --> 00:04:22.070
 it will come out directly but it will not let you 

00:04:20.820 --> 00:04:24.530
 to play 

00:04:22.070 --> 00:04:25.760
 but if you want to play, you have to change 

00:04:24.530 --> 00:04:29.160
 the day a month 

00:04:25.760 --> 00:04:31.849
 it's an account I think he wants to play 

00:04:29.160 --> 00:04:35.240
 and up 

00:04:31.849 --> 00:04:37.520
 but if you have another account in another 

00:04:35.240 --> 00:04:40.330
 server to play on that server os 

00:04:37.520 --> 00:04:40.330
 you go here to data 

00:04:43.350 --> 00:04:47.920
 and change is this that is where he runs 

00:04:45.690 --> 00:04:50.800
 that of our server 

00:04:47.920 --> 00:04:54.000
 I recommend keeping the copper strong 

00:04:50.800 --> 00:04:54.000
 because it served 

00:04:57.370 --> 00:05:01.320
 and I think the tutorial is here
