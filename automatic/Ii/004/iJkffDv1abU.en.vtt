part-time I am working pain-free my
biggest<00:04:21.090> issue<00:04:21.330> is<00:04:21.570> sitting<00:04:22.049> it's<00:04:22.470> the

00:04:22.730 --> 00:04:22.740 
biggest issue is sitting it's the

00:04:22.740 --> 00:04:24.350 
biggest issue is sitting it's the
incision<00:04:23.640> and

00:04:24.350 --> 00:04:24.360 
incision and

00:04:24.360 --> 00:04:27.379 
incision and
where<00:04:25.319> the<00:04:25.740> surgery<00:04:26.069> took<00:04:26.250> place<00:04:26.520> not<00:04:26.939> the

00:04:27.379 --> 00:04:27.389 
where the surgery took place not the

00:04:27.389 --> 00:04:30.040 
where the surgery took place not the
reasons<00:04:28.349> I<00:04:28.439> had<00:04:28.620> the<00:04:28.770> surgery<00:04:29.310> or<00:04:29.520> any

00:04:30.040 --> 00:04:30.050 
reasons I had the surgery or any

00:04:30.050 --> 00:04:32.240 
reasons I had the surgery or any
complications<00:04:31.050> from<00:04:31.229> the<00:04:31.349> surgery<00:04:31.469> it's<00:04:31.979> just

00:04:32.240 --> 00:04:32.250 
complications from the surgery it's just

00:04:32.250 --> 00:04:34.969 
complications from the surgery it's just
a<00:04:32.550> big<00:04:32.969> cut<00:04:33.180> that<00:04:33.360> needs<00:04:33.569> to<00:04:33.780> heal<00:04:34.319> fully<00:04:34.680> that

00:04:34.969 --> 00:04:34.979 
a big cut that needs to heal fully that

00:04:34.979 --> 00:04:37.520 
a big cut that needs to heal fully that
it's<00:04:35.669> pretty<00:04:35.909> deep<00:04:36.120> and<00:04:36.330> it<00:04:36.960> looks<00:04:37.229> good<00:04:37.349> to<00:04:37.500> me

00:04:37.520 --> 00:04:37.530 
it's pretty deep and it looks good to me

00:04:37.530 --> 00:04:39.619 
it's pretty deep and it looks good to me
but<00:04:37.800> it<00:04:38.400> hurts<00:04:38.669> when<00:04:38.819> you<00:04:38.909> press<00:04:39.120> on<00:04:39.270> it<00:04:39.449> so<00:04:39.599> I

00:04:39.619 --> 00:04:39.629 
but it hurts when you press on it so I

00:04:39.629 --> 00:04:43.119 
but it hurts when you press on it so I
try<00:04:39.900> not<00:04:39.960> to<00:04:40.110> press<00:04:40.379> on<00:04:40.560> it<00:04:40.680> too<00:04:40.800> much<00:04:41.009> it<00:04:41.520> is

00:04:43.119 --> 00:04:43.129 
try not to press on it too much it is

00:04:43.129 --> 00:04:45.559 
try not to press on it too much it is
amazing<00:04:44.129> what<00:04:44.219> they<00:04:44.370> can<00:04:44.520> do<00:04:44.699> in<00:04:44.879> my<00:04:45.030> case<00:04:45.300> it

00:04:45.559 --> 00:04:45.569 
amazing what they can do in my case it

00:04:45.569 --> 00:04:47.510 
amazing what they can do in my case it
took<00:04:45.750> care<00:04:46.020> of<00:04:46.050> probably<00:04:46.590> I'd<00:04:47.159> say<00:04:47.219> at<00:04:47.430> this

00:04:47.510 --> 00:04:47.520 
took care of probably I'd say at this

00:04:47.520 --> 00:04:50.330 
took care of probably I'd say at this
point<00:04:47.729> 80<00:04:48.090> 85<00:04:48.509> maybe<00:04:49.259> more<00:04:49.590> percent<00:04:50.069> of<00:04:50.159> what

00:04:50.330 --> 00:04:50.340 
point 80 85 maybe more percent of what

00:04:50.340 --> 00:04:52.939 
point 80 85 maybe more percent of what
the<00:04:50.460> issue<00:04:50.610> was<00:04:50.759> and<00:04:51.180> I'm<00:04:52.169> hopeful<00:04:52.620> that<00:04:52.650> this

00:04:52.939 --> 00:04:52.949 
the issue was and I'm hopeful that this

00:04:52.949 --> 00:04:54.740 
the issue was and I'm hopeful that this
time<00:04:53.009> goes<00:04:53.460> by<00:04:53.490> and<00:04:53.939> as<00:04:54.030> healing<00:04:54.240> continues

00:04:54.740 --> 00:04:54.750 
time goes by and as healing continues

00:04:54.750 --> 00:04:57.140 
time goes by and as healing continues
with<00:04:54.900> the<00:04:54.990> nerves<00:04:55.199> that<00:04:55.349> that<00:04:55.710> is<00:04:56.029> going<00:04:57.029> to<00:04:57.090> be

00:04:57.140 --> 00:04:57.150 
with the nerves that that is going to be

00:04:57.150 --> 00:04:59.809 
with the nerves that that is going to be
a<00:04:57.180> higher<00:04:57.389> percentage<00:04:57.900> when<00:04:58.610> summer<00:04:59.610> comes

00:04:59.809 --> 00:04:59.819 
a higher percentage when summer comes

00:04:59.819 --> 00:05:03.110 
a higher percentage when summer comes
around<00:05:00.000> I've<00:05:00.990> got<00:05:01.289> probably<00:05:01.680> at<00:05:02.580> this<00:05:02.819> point

00:05:03.110 --> 00:05:03.120 
around I've got probably at this point

00:05:03.120 --> 00:05:04.939 
around I've got probably at this point
maybe<00:05:03.629> another<00:05:03.870> week<00:05:04.050> before<00:05:04.379> I<00:05:04.409> start<00:05:04.740> any

00:05:04.939 --> 00:05:04.949 
maybe another week before I start any

00:05:04.949 --> 00:05:07.969 
maybe another week before I start any
kind<00:05:05.009> of<00:05:05.250> dedicated<00:05:05.759> physical<00:05:06.120> therapy<00:05:06.919> it<00:05:07.919> is

00:05:07.969 --> 00:05:07.979 
kind of dedicated physical therapy it is

00:05:07.979 --> 00:05:10.850 
kind of dedicated physical therapy it is
now<00:05:08.219> March<00:05:08.669> the<00:05:09.000> I'm<00:05:09.900> going<00:05:10.050> to<00:05:10.139> say<00:05:10.319> the<00:05:10.500> 10th

00:05:10.850 --> 00:05:10.860 
now March the I'm going to say the 10th

00:05:10.860 --> 00:05:12.649 
now March the I'm going to say the 10th
I<00:05:11.069> think<00:05:11.340> it<00:05:11.430> is<00:05:11.550> and<00:05:11.729> it's<00:05:12.360> going<00:05:12.509> to<00:05:12.569> be

00:05:12.649 --> 00:05:12.659 
I think it is and it's going to be

00:05:12.659 --> 00:05:15.409 
I think it is and it's going to be
another<00:05:12.930> probably<00:05:13.770> month<00:05:14.699> before<00:05:15.090> I<00:05:15.120> can

00:05:15.409 --> 00:05:15.419 
another probably month before I can

00:05:15.419 --> 00:05:17.899 
another probably month before I can
think<00:05:16.199> about<00:05:16.439> swinging<00:05:16.830> a<00:05:17.069> golf<00:05:17.219> club<00:05:17.639> and

00:05:17.899 --> 00:05:17.909 
think about swinging a golf club and

00:05:17.909 --> 00:05:21.740 
think about swinging a golf club and
probably<00:05:18.840> honestly<00:05:19.469> it's<00:05:19.830> going<00:05:19.949> to<00:05:20.039> be<00:05:20.750> June

00:05:21.740 --> 00:05:21.750 
probably honestly it's going to be June

00:05:21.750 --> 00:05:23.510 
probably honestly it's going to be June
as<00:05:22.289> much<00:05:22.469> as<00:05:22.620> it<00:05:22.740> hurts<00:05:22.919> me<00:05:23.069> to<00:05:23.159> say<00:05:23.310> that

00:05:23.510 --> 00:05:23.520 
as much as it hurts me to say that

00:05:23.520 --> 00:05:25.399 
as much as it hurts me to say that
before<00:05:23.669> I<00:05:23.819> can<00:05:23.909> actually<00:05:24.120> get<00:05:24.509> out<00:05:24.659> and<00:05:24.689> play

00:05:25.399 --> 00:05:25.409 
before I can actually get out and play

00:05:25.409 --> 00:05:27.230 
before I can actually get out and play
golf<00:05:25.590> go<00:05:25.919> to<00:05:25.979> the<00:05:26.099> driving<00:05:26.370> range<00:05:26.520> do<00:05:26.909> anything

00:05:27.230 --> 00:05:27.240 
golf go to the driving range do anything

00:05:27.240 --> 00:05:29.480 
golf go to the driving range do anything
like<00:05:27.419> that<00:05:27.599> just<00:05:27.779> because<00:05:27.900> of<00:05:28.080> the<00:05:28.319> the<00:05:29.250> time

00:05:29.480 --> 00:05:29.490 
like that just because of the the time

00:05:29.490 --> 00:05:31.390 
like that just because of the the time
that's<00:05:29.669> needed<00:05:29.849> to<00:05:30.060> sort<00:05:30.270> of<00:05:30.419> build<00:05:30.839> up<00:05:31.020> that

00:05:31.390 --> 00:05:31.400 
that's needed to sort of build up that

00:05:31.400 --> 00:05:33.920 
that's needed to sort of build up that
that<00:05:32.400> contorting<00:05:33.029> motion<00:05:33.389> to<00:05:33.509> sort<00:05:33.719> of<00:05:33.810> get

00:05:33.920 --> 00:05:33.930 
that contorting motion to sort of get

00:05:33.930 --> 00:05:36.050 
that contorting motion to sort of get
your<00:05:34.050> golf<00:05:34.259> swing<00:05:34.490> where<00:05:35.490> you<00:05:35.580> needed<00:05:35.759> to<00:05:35.849> be

00:05:36.050 --> 00:05:36.060 
your golf swing where you needed to be

00:05:36.060 --> 00:05:38.029 
your golf swing where you needed to be
which<00:05:36.300> isn't<00:05:37.020> important<00:05:37.440> to<00:05:37.500> most<00:05:37.620> people<00:05:37.979> but

00:05:38.029 --> 00:05:38.039 
which isn't important to most people but

00:05:38.039 --> 00:05:40.550 
which isn't important to most people but
it<00:05:38.159> is<00:05:38.190> important<00:05:38.729> to<00:05:38.759> me<00:05:38.969> so<00:05:39.210> that's<00:05:40.080> it<00:05:40.349> for

00:05:40.550 --> 00:05:40.560 
it is important to me so that's it for

00:05:40.560 --> 00:05:42.439 
it is important to me so that's it for
now<00:05:40.680> I<00:05:40.710> would<00:05:41.069> tell<00:05:41.250> you<00:05:41.310> that<00:05:41.430> if<00:05:42.300> you're

00:05:42.439 --> 00:05:42.449 
now I would tell you that if you're

00:05:42.449 --> 00:05:45.019 
now I would tell you that if you're
thinking<00:05:42.599> about<00:05:42.810> doing<00:05:42.960> the<00:05:43.259> surgery<00:05:43.500> I<00:05:44.029> found

00:05:45.019 --> 00:05:45.029 
thinking about doing the surgery I found

00:05:45.029 --> 00:05:46.909 
thinking about doing the surgery I found
it<00:05:45.210> to<00:05:45.300> be<00:05:45.330> something<00:05:45.690> that<00:05:45.870> was<00:05:46.139> definitely

00:05:46.909 --> 00:05:46.919 
it to be something that was definitely

00:05:46.919 --> 00:05:48.790 
it to be something that was definitely
worth<00:05:47.310> the<00:05:47.339> time<00:05:47.610> and<00:05:47.669> the<00:05:47.849> effort<00:05:47.969> to<00:05:48.180> do<00:05:48.419> and

00:05:48.790 --> 00:05:48.800 
worth the time and the effort to do and

00:05:48.800 --> 00:05:50.839 
worth the time and the effort to do and
as<00:05:49.800> I<00:05:49.979> roll<00:05:50.190> forward<00:05:50.520> with<00:05:50.610> this

00:05:50.839 --> 00:05:50.849 
as I roll forward with this
