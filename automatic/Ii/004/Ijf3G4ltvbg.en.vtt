00:00:00.440 --> 00:00:10.940
 Good and I'm the last snow this week Te 

00:00:05.090 --> 00:00:12.720
 Black Line League conditions are difficult 

00:00:10.940 --> 00:00:15.720
 Talk 

00:00:12.720 --> 00:00:15.720
 Good luck 

00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:20.780
 Paint 

00:00:18.640 --> 00:00:23.250
 Good 

00:00:20.780 --> 00:00:27.960
 Kansai 

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:35.309
 But I wonder really large melee also look again 

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:39.210
 It is possible to advance to the final tournament by qualifying each group to a club that is still normal 

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:44.730
 There is a possibility of defeating the league 

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:49.489
 So I have to slam into my head first 

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:49.489
 Determining the order when the past is lined up 

00:00:49.640 --> 00:01:01.829
 The order of priority is the score difference and then the total number of points 

00:00:55.050 --> 00:01:08.480
 And if the numbers are lined up, it will be the result of the team car 

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:12.830
 Now let's take a look from the group a 

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:16.560
 There is no team that has decided to break through yet 

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:19.890
 There is a possibility for many Sanfrecce Hiroshima 

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:23.369
 First of all, it is fc Tokyo, which is the top of the present 

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:27.570
 If it is more than this section draw, it breaks through without complaint 

00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:34.560
 Even if you lose further and you are lined up in Niigata and Shonan with a point 

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:36.550
 It's fine as long as the order of special demand has not suffered a crushing defeat from the most common and emerged in the legendary second place 

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:41.230
 Albi Rex Niigata 

00:01:36.550 --> 00:01:47.190
 If you win over Matsumoto, you will pass the qualifying league unconditionally 

00:01:41.230 --> 00:01:47.190
 Depending on the result of other venues, it is less than a draw 

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:53.230
 It is easy to understand so far 

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:58.810
 It is the third place in water Shonan Bellmare 

00:01:53.230 --> 00:02:02.100
 fc Tokyo is a victory over 3 points because the goal difference is 4 points open 

00:01:58.810 --> 00:02:09.840
 More than people are decided and breakthrough is decided 

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:12.780
 However, in the case of a victory of 2 points difference, the goal difference is fc fc with 4 points in line with Tokyo 

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:18.390
 Don't go over Tokyo 

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:22.700
 In this case, if Niigata is less than a draw, will the cup be decided? 

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:22.700
 Oh, it has become increasingly difficult ｰｰｰｰ 

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:31.390
 Well then and 

00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:34.930
 There is actually a possibility that only Sagan Tosu is in the content of the syllable match 

00:02:31.390 --> 00:02:42.849
 2-2-way and 3-positions of Yabure to burn Nagatomo 

00:02:34.930 --> 00:02:45.500
 In addition , it is a miracle if the goal difference is less than minus 2 and the 5th place Hiroshima is more than draw 

00:02:42.849 --> 00:02:50.910
 Reversal of 

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:53.930
 The conditions seem to be quite strict, but it is football that you do not know what happens 

00:02:50.910 --> 00:02:57.170
 And the last is Sakai San Frece Hiroshima 

00:02:53.930 --> 00:03:01.780
 Because it is decided to get rid of animals 

00:02:57.170 --> 00:03:08.370
 Anyway , I would like to buy it to Kofu and wait for the other venue results. 

00:03:01.780 --> 00:03:13.650
 On top of that , if 22 breaks and the minimum is less than the draw, the breakthrough is decided 

00:03:08.370 --> 00:03:18.490
 And if Niigata wins, it's ok if it's a win over the old age 

00:03:13.650 --> 00:03:21.510
 If it is a victory by 1 point, it will be a battle with a total score and 

00:03:18.490 --> 00:03:24.930
 Oh my head is getting tired 

00:03:21.510 --> 00:03:31.319
 Hey rester 

00:03:24.930 --> 00:03:33.430
 Aid Loop final snow is as you see sign Shonan and leader fc Tokyo's direct confrontation is 

00:03:31.319 --> 00:03:41.010
 bmw's Stadium 

00:03:33.430 --> 00:03:41.010
 And Niigata is moving away and Hiroshima will be playing at the headquarters. 

00:03:41.210 --> 00:03:50.290
 Well , let's turn to the rice group next time 

00:03:45.400 --> 00:03:56.600
 This is because Nagoya has decided to pass the qualifying league soon 

00:03:50.290 --> 00:04:00.260
 The first team in the store to win the remaining 1 frame 

00:03:56.600 --> 00:04:07.930
 Because these three teams have almost no difference in points 

00:04:00.260 --> 00:04:15.310
 The last may be the match of the match between the teams concerned, such as the governor. 

00:04:07.930 --> 00:04:17.049
 My brother's head is Nagoya Grampus who played the first in the final tournament and his brother is Yamagata Kawasaki 

00:04:15.310 --> 00:04:22.630
 There is one more point though 

00:04:17.049 --> 00:04:28.000
 In the overall score, you won with a taser as much as you are in Yamagata 

00:04:22.630 --> 00:04:34.810
 And 3rd place Montedio Yamagata is at home Yokohama f Marinos 

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:36.150
 And it is put 2 goals or more at a minimum because here there is a goal's of the head but it is advantageous in the total score 

00:04:34.810 --> 00:04:41.580
 I won't win 

00:04:36.150 --> 00:04:45.390
 And 4th place Kawasaki Frontale is 6th at home, and it is a game with Vegalta Sendai 

00:04:41.580 --> 00:04:50.139
 Because I'm so even know, especially there are also the benefits 

00:04:45.390 --> 00:04:55.629
 Kawasaki I'm aiming for anyway large quantities score boast of attack force 

00:04:50.139 --> 00:04:59.529
 In any case, these three teams have to fight while watching the results of other venues 

00:04:55.629 --> 00:05:03.669
 There is no doubt that the thrilling will decline 

00:04:59.529 --> 00:05:10.200
 b Group final snow is 3 Yamagata as you see 

00:05:03.669 --> 00:05:13.360
 4th place Kawasaki is a home and a brother Kobe is a fight with Nagoya by away 

00:05:10.200 --> 00:05:16.720
 Train move home country kick off 

00:05:13.360 --> 00:05:19.350
 Is the final snow a road drama born? 

00:05:16.720 --> 00:05:19.350
 I 'm looking forward to it 

00:05:20.490 --> 00:05:25.080
 yeah 

00:05:22.330 --> 00:05:25.080
 I got it 

00:05:32.700 --> 00:05:37.479
 The 

00:05:34.610 --> 00:05:37.479
 Ah ah ah ah
