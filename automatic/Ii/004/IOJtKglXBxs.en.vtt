 here he stands with nothing done well and 

00:00:40.690 --> 00:00:50.530
 of course outwardly necessary 

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:25.170
 press again but secondly it gives it 

00:01:22.090 --> 00:01:25.170
 this strength 

00:01:34.070 --> 00:01:38.300
 new to very good parents

 positively 

00:01:51.550 --> 00:02:01.750
 just yet we carried out 

00:01:59.020 --> 00:02:04.120
 these experiments have become our own space 

00:02:01.750 --> 00:02:05.980
 phrases minute of every bit of its 

00:02:04.120 --> 00:02:07.790

 to stagnate 

00:02:14.450 --> 00:02:19.970
 his will be yes here based on this 

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:22.460
 estates will be 7 narcologists show 

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:28.690
 how to make different kinds of bricks herself 

00:02:22.460 --> 00:02:28.690
 the monolith is not the very Gascon proportions 

00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:33.490
 Mommy try 

00:02:36.520 --> 00:02:41.750
 there are secrets there just taken 

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:44.510
 let's say a half liter jar they 

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:46.330
 poured put on this glass faded 

00:02:44.510 --> 00:02:49.130
 put a little here 

00:02:46.330 --> 00:02:53.000
 mix well left there 

00:02:49.130 --> 00:02:57.010
 it is necessary here you look about how much you have 

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:59.980
 clay is pure for you to bring 

00:02:57.010 --> 00:03:02.230
 approximately you look how much 

00:02:59.980 --> 00:03:04.299
 and then another experiment which we 

00:03:02.230 --> 00:03:07.569
 did on these other rays did 

00:03:04.299 --> 00:03:11.620
 that is, I first did 

00:03:07.569 --> 00:03:13.480
 bricks . lists or another he looked 

00:03:11.620 --> 00:03:15.780
 how much sand is needed yes this is not for you 

00:03:13.480 --> 00:03:19.180
 crumbled him was like a weatherstaff bin 

00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:21.610
 too signage about it when he got 

00:03:19.180 --> 00:03:24.819
 Here is the proportion that endure strong 

00:03:21.610 --> 00:03:26.650
 ends he stole a little sand began 

00:03:24.819 --> 00:03:28.930
 add watch straw she 

00:03:26.650 --> 00:03:31.000
 about but also gives the same 

00:03:28.930 --> 00:03:33.670
 effect like sand plan 

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:35.430
 friability here it is 

00:03:33.670 --> 00:03:41.590
 experimentally then to the end 

00:03:35.430 --> 00:03:44.859
 h3 little bricks already is-3 to sample methods 

00:03:41.590 --> 00:03:45.340
 and make little bricks well away 

00:03:44.859 --> 00:03:49.859
 complicated 

00:03:45.340 --> 00:03:49.859
 For this from books such 

00:03:53.069 --> 00:03:59.510
