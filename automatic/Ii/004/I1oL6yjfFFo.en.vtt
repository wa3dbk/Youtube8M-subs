00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:11.940 
once again the vertical passing attack

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:13.220 
once again the vertical passing attack
has<00:02:12.150> been<00:02:12.300> doing<00:02:12.629> very

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:13.230 
has been doing very

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:15.500 
has been doing very
well<00:02:13.319> as<00:02:13.530> of<00:02:13.650> late<00:02:13.709> and<00:02:14.159> now<00:02:14.849> we<00:02:14.909> have<00:02:15.030> second

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:15.510 
well as of late and now we have second

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:17.030 
well as of late and now we have second
and<00:02:15.569> goal<00:02:15.780> and<00:02:15.989> i<00:02:16.080> think<00:02:16.319> i<00:02:16.409> just<00:02:16.440> had<00:02:16.709> snapped

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:17.040 
and goal and i think i just had snapped

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:18.320 
and goal and i think i just had snapped
too<00:02:17.250> many<00:02:17.430> times<00:02:17.670> and<00:02:17.970> threw<00:02:18.090> the<00:02:18.180> ball

00:02:18.320 --> 00:02:18.330 
too many times and threw the ball

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:20.630 
too many times and threw the ball
backwards<00:02:18.390> so<00:02:19.019> we<00:02:19.140> have<00:02:19.319> third<00:02:20.010> and<00:02:20.159> goal<00:02:20.220> from

00:02:20.630 --> 00:02:20.640 
backwards so we have third and goal from

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:22.430 
backwards so we have third and goal from
behind<00:02:21.030> the<00:02:21.180> 20-yard<00:02:21.629> line<00:02:21.690> it<00:02:22.019> don't<00:02:22.230> matter

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:22.440 
behind the 20-yard line it don't matter

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:24.740 
behind the 20-yard line it don't matter
let's<00:02:22.680> go<00:02:22.739> to<00:02:22.890> the<00:02:23.069> end<00:02:23.220> zone<00:02:23.370> one<00:02:24.090> on<00:02:24.269> one<00:02:24.569> we
