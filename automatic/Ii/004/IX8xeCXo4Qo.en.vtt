quite bloody but dark brown it was a
deep<00:04:18.039> corpora<00:04:18.400> blonde<00:04:18.669> oh<00:04:19.000> she's<00:04:19.750> really<00:04:19.780> just

00:04:20.099 --> 00:04:20.109 
deep corpora blonde oh she's really just

00:04:20.109 --> 00:04:24.960 
deep corpora blonde oh she's really just
ginger<00:04:20.940> and<00:04:22.620> so<00:04:23.620> obviously<00:04:23.770> so<00:04:24.520> I<00:04:24.550> drove<00:04:24.910> a

00:04:24.960 --> 00:04:24.970 
ginger and so obviously so I drove a

00:04:24.970 --> 00:04:27.300 
ginger and so obviously so I drove a
little<00:04:25.120> watch<00:04:25.360> 12<00:04:25.660> you<00:04:25.780> putting<00:04:26.380> that<00:04:26.410> one<00:04:26.770> or

00:04:27.300 --> 00:04:27.310 
little watch 12 you putting that one or

00:04:27.310 --> 00:04:30.600 
little watch 12 you putting that one or
that<00:04:27.370> one<00:04:27.600> but<00:04:28.600> I<00:04:28.630> was<00:04:28.870> thinking<00:04:29.229> I<00:04:29.610> probably

00:04:30.600 --> 00:04:30.610 
that one but I was thinking I probably

00:04:30.610 --> 00:04:32.189 
that one but I was thinking I probably
is<00:04:30.789> that<00:04:30.970> one<00:04:31.180> if<00:04:31.479> it<00:04:31.600> is<00:04:31.690> actually<00:04:31.840> for<00:04:32.169> a

00:04:32.189 --> 00:04:32.199 
is that one if it is actually for a

00:04:32.199 --> 00:04:34.110 
is that one if it is actually for a
colored<00:04:32.620> here<00:04:32.949> too<00:04:33.370> late<00:04:33.550> and<00:04:33.669> colored<00:04:33.910> here

00:04:34.110 --> 00:04:34.120 
colored here too late and colored here

00:04:34.120 --> 00:04:39.270 
colored here too late and colored here
and<00:04:34.750> then<00:04:37.380> I'll<00:04:38.380> just<00:04:38.560> leave<00:04:38.680> that<00:04:38.740> one<00:04:39.070> for

00:04:39.270 --> 00:04:39.280 
and then I'll just leave that one for
