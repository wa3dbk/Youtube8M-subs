00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:13.799
 and hello to all dear friends with you alex 

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:15.929
 vance 

00:00:13.799 --> 00:00:18.029
 and today i will show how to make my 

00:00:15.929 --> 00:00:20.310
 server on minecraft 1 7 10 

00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:22.140
 how to set it up and how constantly it 

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:25.260
 plugins and so the first thing we need 

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:28.650
 do this go to the browser and go to 

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:31.650
 site minecraft ru.com singing dot com 

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:33.750
 slash bucket so go to this site and 

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:37.950
 So here we have an article with you 

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:41.969
 what is bucket and where does it come from 

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:44.070
 took and how to set up a server and so for 

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:46.020
 start we need to craft craft bucket 

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:51.690
 so you can download it here 

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:55.289
 on the side find 171 click on this number 

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:58.350
 and you have a page where you can 

00:00:55.289 --> 00:01:00.750
 download craft parquet so save and 

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:04.670
 further what we need to do is create 

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:08.250
 desktop folder and name it 

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:11.340
 server well yes server here so you can 

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:13.170
 it is natural to call her own way and where 

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:13.590
 it will be irrelevant 

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:16.110
 at all 

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:18.810
 and so on we need to create a text 

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:21.600
 document and call it start it with us 

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:24.600
 there will be a file then a bat which will 

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:26.939
 run our server and so on to us 

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:29.310
 need to move our craft banquet to this 

00:01:26.939 --> 00:01:33.180
 folder with the server then we are with you 

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:36.479
 open the start and we have to find 

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:39.030
 special suitable command for 

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:43.020
 launch and so here you are here all 

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:46.860
 what is for 32-bit system 

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:49.500
 or 64 bit systems and 64 bit versions 

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:53.220
 java we write it that is everything is painted 

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:54.689
 choose the appropriate team and 

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:56.310
 find out your bit system you 

00:01:54.689 --> 00:01:58.860
 just enough to go to my 

00:01:56.310 --> 00:02:02.070
 computer properties and there will be all 

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:04.560
 information about your computer here here 

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:06.869
 it is written right with me that I have 64 

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:09.420
 bit operating system 

00:02:06.869 --> 00:02:11.670
 in general, we are picking up 

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:16.890
 a team that suits us for example 

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:20.400
 there is create a script to simplify 

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:23.190
 run ie i have 64 bit system 

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:27.720
 and 64 bit, which means it suits me 

00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:30.450
 copy it and paste it here below 

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:33.860
 what we need to do we copy with you 

00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:36.600
 this file is completely off the name and 

00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:40.800
 then here here we enter it all 

00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:42.540
 remove craftbukkit version and. jar it 

00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:46.040
 remove and paste everything that we are with you 

00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:49.760
 copy so save and then change 

00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:52.019
 files start extension on bard 

00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:54.170
 We agree, and further we can 

00:02:52.019 --> 00:02:56.880
 it will run a little now 

00:02:54.170 --> 00:02:59.130
 long dive and I would like 

00:02:56.880 --> 00:03:02.269
 explain what to do if you do not have 

00:02:59.130 --> 00:03:04.980
 file extensions text banjar 

00:03:02.269 --> 00:03:05.790
 to include them in the control panel we 

00:03:04.980 --> 00:03:08.100
 we go with you 

00:03:05.790 --> 00:03:11.069
 design and personalization options 

00:03:08.100 --> 00:03:12.510
 Folder view and you will have the bottom here 

00:03:11.069 --> 00:03:15.540
 hide extensions for 

00:03:12.510 --> 00:03:17.850
 registered file types in this 

00:03:15.540 --> 00:03:22.230
 tick off and then you will appear 

00:03:17.850 --> 00:03:24.030
 the file extension so here we wrote 

00:03:22.230 --> 00:03:26.870
 what library loading please 

00:03:24.030 --> 00:03:30.150
 wait and he writes what we have 

00:03:26.870 --> 00:03:32.940
 insufficient rights further we must be with you 

00:03:30.150 --> 00:03:36.060
 go to the file hello.txt 

00:03:32.940 --> 00:03:38.549
 this file is blocked further 

00:03:36.060 --> 00:03:40.739
 server setup so we need 

00:03:38.549 --> 00:03:43.170
 here instead of falls write pipes under we 

00:03:40.739 --> 00:03:45.630
 wrote pipes and save close 

00:03:43.170 --> 00:03:47.400
 Save further once it starts the server 

00:03:45.630 --> 00:03:50.040
 write loading libraries please 

00:03:47.400 --> 00:03:52.500
 wait and then we will begin with you 

00:03:50.040 --> 00:03:55.739
 normal server load like me and 

00:03:52.500 --> 00:04:00.269
 spoke here we immediately had files 

00:03:55.739 --> 00:04:03.810
 that is, here is this file where is he 

00:04:00.269 --> 00:04:06.090
 file it blocks loading and setting 

00:04:03.810 --> 00:04:08.730
 servers, that is, the strain he loaded 

00:04:06.090 --> 00:04:09.560
 libraries created the world and created 

00:04:08.730 --> 00:04:11.900
 rest 

00:04:09.560 --> 00:04:14.390
 documents in which information will be and 

00:04:11.900 --> 00:04:16.190
 server so we have about the load camera all 

00:04:14.390 --> 00:04:19.400
 the server is loaded now we have to 

00:04:16.190 --> 00:04:22.730
 write stop write stop and press 

00:04:19.400 --> 00:04:25.040
 any key further to configure 

00:04:22.730 --> 00:04:27.470
 server we need to log into the server and 

00:04:25.040 --> 00:04:30.139
 properties and here we will have 

00:04:27.470 --> 00:04:32.630
 a lot of lines and each of them 

00:04:30.139 --> 00:04:33.530
 has its meaning here we have specified 

00:04:32.630 --> 00:04:35.510
 port 

00:04:33.530 --> 00:04:37.940
 if you have a port then you have it 

00:04:35.510 --> 00:04:40.490
 enter if not, then don't 

00:04:37.940 --> 00:04:43.130
 then write the ip server and write here 

00:04:40.490 --> 00:04:46.790
 my pi address and so i have a dynamic 

00:04:43.130 --> 00:04:50.840
 ip address so i installed hamachi 

00:04:46.790 --> 00:04:53.950
 Further we are this line is 

00:04:50.840 --> 00:04:59.229
 denotes the maximum block height 

00:04:53.950 --> 00:05:03.530
 256 blocks the height of the world and we will put on 

00:04:59.229 --> 00:05:06.380
 2560 someone needs can write someone about 

00:05:03.530 --> 00:05:10.090
 This did not know then the online mod we need 

00:05:06.380 --> 00:05:12.889
 put an online mod fous if you 

00:05:10.090 --> 00:05:14.990
 licensed for example this is your server and 

00:05:12.889 --> 00:05:16.880
 suddenly he doesn't have a license 

00:05:14.990 --> 00:05:20.660
 then you need to put falls to 

00:05:16.880 --> 00:05:22.940
 play together here when only lecithin 

00:05:20.660 --> 00:05:25.850
 checks can play on the server of all 100 

00:05:22.940 --> 00:05:28.250
 when can and people who with pirate and 

00:05:25.850 --> 00:05:30.260
 licensed boys at the same time then 

00:05:28.250 --> 00:05:32.780
 even difficulty this complexity 

00:05:30.260 --> 00:05:35.600
 one is when you have a monster run 

00:05:32.780 --> 00:05:38.660
 0 this is when you have no monsters so here 

00:05:35.600 --> 00:05:39.830
 This is our description of the server, I will write 

00:05:38.660 --> 00:05:42.680
 Alix Wance 

00:05:39.830 --> 00:05:46.100
 Well, to check and work or not 

00:05:42.680 --> 00:05:47.630
 gave it to them we close it all and now 

00:05:46.100 --> 00:05:50.330
 I'll show you how to install plugins 

00:05:47.630 --> 00:05:54.139
 to make oral plugins and download them altogether 

00:05:50.330 --> 00:05:56.240
 we need to go to df site . the bank . he 

00:05:54.139 --> 00:05:58.700
 and here we can find you pay not 

00:05:56.240 --> 00:06:00.979
 I will install worldedit because 

00:05:58.700 --> 00:06:03.770
 This is the easiest plugin you can. 

00:06:00.979 --> 00:06:07.130
 install and in general here as if 

00:06:03.770 --> 00:06:08.840
 are you looking for another plugin and how 

00:06:07.130 --> 00:06:11.570
 restore just as install 

00:06:08.840 --> 00:06:13.850
 as worldedit so called home then fret 

00:06:11.570 --> 00:06:16.120
 here we press and here we 

00:06:13.850 --> 00:06:19.310
 downloaded worldedit then we further 

00:06:16.120 --> 00:06:21.919
 open this file and go to the folder 

00:06:19.310 --> 00:06:22.940
 here they simply bred here 

00:06:21.919 --> 00:06:26.150
 here's a worldedit 

00:06:22.940 --> 00:06:29.000
 . jar copy here here then we need 

00:06:26.150 --> 00:06:30.760
 start the server and about to fire up 

00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:33.740
 maynkravt so here we run 

00:06:30.760 --> 00:06:36.320
 the server started minecraft then 

00:06:33.740 --> 00:06:39.350
 we go into multiplayer and now i have mine 

00:06:36.320 --> 00:06:42.710
 I have already entered the server so we go 

00:06:39.350 --> 00:06:46.190
 on the server and see if we work 

00:06:42.710 --> 00:06:49.340
 general server so server works like you 

00:06:46.190 --> 00:06:53.150
 see yes then let's check it out 

00:06:49.340 --> 00:06:56.180
 so we need about we need timidly

 so now we will take a hatchet 

00:06:56.180 --> 00:07:01.610
 and change our game mode so in one with 

00:06:59.750 --> 00:07:03.290
 you have changed the game mode and now 

00:07:01.610 --> 00:07:05.840
 let's see if we work 

00:07:03.290 --> 00:07:08.480
 worldedit so as you see here with us 

00:07:05.840 --> 00:07:13.210
