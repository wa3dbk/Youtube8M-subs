00:00:00.800 --> 00:00:07.340
 so welcome to my first 

00:00:03.920 --> 00:00:10.679
 Crochet introductory video on the subject 

00:00:07.340 --> 00:00:13.110
 we can now the first 

00:00:10.679 --> 00:00:16.379
 So all serve the basis for 

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:19.020
 each crochet air masses are whole 

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:22.289
 you just start with that one 

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:25.140
 thread on the hand puts an envelope 

00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:26.460
 takes and the back thread to the front 

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:30.599
 Going back through goal is a very simple one 

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:33.180
 makes things that can be with the thread 

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:35.790
 that leads to the knoll that it is here 

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:38.210
 Not in the picture because it is he leads 

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:41.309
 back to the ball when you pull on it 

00:00:38.210 --> 00:00:44.430
 smaller with seedlings and if one at the 

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:45.539
 floppy sees itself grows larger 

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:47.520
 take our needle 

00:00:45.539 --> 00:00:49.020
 In this case I have to do that well 

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:54.500
 show 7 

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:54.500
 a six needle and a 7 thread 

00:00:54.620 --> 00:01:04.650
 All this nice to show you that once 

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:07.200
 on the hooks firmly 

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:10.070
 then we take the classic ones 

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:12.780
 Classic crochet handle with the wool 

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:15.810
 once between the small and the 

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:17.130
 ring finger through and once around the 

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:19.049
 wrap your index finger 

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:21.180
 you can also keep the thread different 

00:01:19.049 --> 00:01:22.799
 That's best done on the day 

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:25.380
 Best wishes how best to do that 

00:01:22.799 --> 00:01:27.509
 The drive must always be curious 

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:29.070
 but may also be loosely tightened the 

00:01:27.509 --> 00:01:31.799
 is exactly here given 

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:34.439
 if you want to do it differently it is 

00:01:31.799 --> 00:01:37.759
 yes, everyone can do the creative work 

00:01:34.439 --> 00:01:41.520
 be free as he likes so we start 

00:01:37.759 --> 00:01:45.360
 by using the needle under the thread 

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:47.520
 go down the thread on the hook 

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:52.020
 get and pull through the loop 

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:54.590
 once through our first air mass we 

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:56.579
 pull the thread again 

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:59.340
 that works best with one 

00:01:56.579 --> 00:02:03.090
 Rotary movement that makes the thread beautiful 

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:06.869
 on the needle has shows a couple of times 

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:09.439
 always just pick and get through 

00:02:06.869 --> 00:02:09.439
 and through 

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:23.500
 get through hole now and even with 

00:02:21.370 --> 00:02:25.239
 let this simplest mesh type 

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:28.269
 already pretty things to do eg 

00:02:25.239 --> 00:02:29.440
 bracelets or chains in the other 

00:02:28.269 --> 00:02:30.849
 video I do pretty for example 

00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:36.640
 bracelets with it if you look there 

00:02:30.849 --> 00:02:38.260
 I want to be so and I disgust continue to do so 

00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:39.489
 you practice the movement a bit 

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:42.040
 always the same 

00:02:39.489 --> 00:02:44.829
 It is quite good if you stop that 

00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:46.390
 bit eintrainiert later one needs 

00:02:44.829 --> 00:02:49.180
 not to think about it 

00:02:46.390 --> 00:02:52.650
 goes one in mark and leg over always 

00:02:49.180 --> 00:02:54.879
 nice to get and pull through 

00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:59.590
 that should not be enough for now 

00:02:54.879 --> 00:03:03.459
 again, this is how it looks 

00:02:59.590 --> 00:03:05.379
 once shot stop always by always 

00:03:03.459 --> 00:03:06.450
 again pulled through by itself 

00:03:05.379 --> 00:03:10.680
 the drive 

00:03:06.450 --> 00:03:10.680
 These are our air meshes
