 Jajane Logitech Wireless Keyboard ka 27 circle 

00:00:07.319 --> 00:00:15.210
 It is this keyboard Because I tried using this keyboard for a while, its feeling of use 

00:00:13.019 --> 00:00:20.020
 I want to do a review 

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:24.910
 First connect the receiver and connect the usb receiver to the pc 

00:00:20.020 --> 00:00:29.830
 It is a way to make this keyboard usable on a personal computer 

00:00:24.910 --> 00:00:32.380
 Os was easy to market, I mean Tsu if it did what I and is I are using is 

00:00:29.830 --> 00:00:38.680
 of windows 7 but is 64 bits I 

00:00:32.380 --> 00:00:39.430
 It is usable immediately just by connecting the attached usb receiver of the hey to the personal computer 

00:00:38.680 --> 00:00:40.010
 It became 

00:00:39.430 --> 00:00:44.870
 Is that 

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:45.440
 It was just ok, if you turn on the power of this sound keyboard, it's ok now 

00:00:44.870 --> 00:00:48.890
 is not it 

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:54.379
 So the way is just the sound of usb receiver 

00:00:48.890 --> 00:00:58.820
 Soon only plugging Koch of power by itself is already automatically connected if turned on 

00:00:54.379 --> 00:01:00.030
 You will be able to go to bed when the first usb receiver is plugged in 

00:00:58.820 --> 00:01:04.019
 Of drivers 

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:09.240
 Installation is done automatically, but what is it like? 

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:13.259
 Yes here if you attach the usb receiver that came with this feeling 

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:17.580
 Yes This screen appears on the screen of pc Driver software 

00:01:13.259 --> 00:01:19.000
 A screen called "Install" appears and it automatically looks like this A good stall for the driver 

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:24.430
 It has been conducted 

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:25.600
 This can be used another keyboard gold when it is displayed you will see that you are ready to use 

00:01:24.430 --> 00:01:30.580
 It becomes like 

00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:32.170
 Only the other not is really I thought I wonder if there is something difficult set Toka I a feeling that well 

00:01:30.580 --> 00:01:37.780
 It was easy to use 

00:01:32.170 --> 00:01:39.020
 What Does the case to be connected in a single receiver to something more of it Logitech product But 

00:01:37.780 --> 00:01:43.579
 I of that unify ring 

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:48.049
 The soft-something download and Well a little set like a there is a need to do the the 

00:01:43.579 --> 00:01:52.429
 Only there over there, I need some attention, but for the time being it is sold with that set 

00:01:48.049 --> 00:01:53.179
 If the receiver and the keyboard are a mouse, you can use it just by plugging it in 

00:01:52.429 --> 00:01:57.079
 is 

00:01:53.179 --> 00:01:59.010
 Yes, so try using it, but there is a point I'm interested in 

00:01:57.079 --> 00:02:02.250

00:01:59.010 --> 00:02:06.090

 This lamp shows the sound status of this keyboard 

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:23.830
 There is only one I for some reason that it is the keyboard of this sound priority version of Ai-chan 

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:28.000
 It is a keyboard of a total of 200 Logitech, which is a priority version for the mountain resort. 

00:02:23.830 --> 00:02:31.330
 It is almost the same as making up, but the priority is just that difference of being wireless 

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:34.450
 For a total of 200 people who do not have priority 

00:02:31.330 --> 00:02:38.290
 There are 3 nice lamps , 3 are there 

00:02:34.450 --> 00:02:42.280

00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:48.370
 but 

00:02:42.760 --> 00:02:51.459
 Yes If you 're a total of 27 Marue Wireless here, there seems to be no one lamp. 

00:02:48.370 --> 00:02:54.470
 I can only check the caps lock 

00:02:51.459 --> 00:02:58.670

 It is all right, reaction does not have any problem already 

00:03:54.460 --> 00:04:04.240
 It doesn't change at all if you usually use a priority keyboard 

00:03:59.140 --> 00:04:09.880
 There is no problem . It feels OK. Hey there is a total of 27. 

00:04:04.240 --> 00:04:10.910
 Actually I tried to input, but the sound response speed of the input is also very good. 

00:04:09.880 --> 00:04:14.870
 Well with priority 

00:04:10.910 --> 00:04:20.420
 It hardly changed, etc. It was usable without any problem at all 

00:04:14.870 --> 00:04:22.910
 I the only usb receiver also how to connect to a computer the first time you buy so 

00:04:20.420 --> 00:04:29.240
 Of this side to connect the camera to your computer 

00:04:22.910 --> 00:04:30.900
 It very so so ready to use the power is recognized automatically simply by on 

00:04:29.240 --> 00:04:34.889
 Easy and a mode 

00:04:30.900 --> 00:04:39.060
 I felt that it was easy to use and I liked it 

00:04:34.889 --> 00:04:43.259
 The price is also because I bought it for 1430 yen at amazon. 

00:04:39.060 --> 00:04:49.440
 Well it is already the best as a keyboard you can buy for just 1000 yen
