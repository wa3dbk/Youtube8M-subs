00:00:00.390 --> 00:00:04.080
 there are very good youtube for wanted 

00:00:02.100 --> 00:00:06.359
 commenting today I bring you a gameplay no 

00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:08.100
 in the new bcd maps come to me 

00:00:06.359 --> 00:00:11.520
 you have asked so much for a gameplay 

00:00:08.100 --> 00:00:13.320
 our new map 6 in which it follows 

00:00:11.520 --> 00:00:14.460
 doing multiplayer but I think that 

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:15.570
 is more appropriate after two games 

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:17.160
 loose in each of the new ones for 

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:19.140
 that you see seeing and good is the turn 

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:20.789
 of coaches on a map that is like a 

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:21.960
 lost island in which a plane has been 

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:24.210
 crashed the truth that is quite 

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:26.909
 well that plane reminds me a lot 

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:29.579
 some other for example this way I 

00:00:26.909 --> 00:00:30.869
 It reminds a lot of modern warfare 3 

00:00:29.579 --> 00:00:32.850
 missions that there were of the you were not me 

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:34.289
 I remember that map that part and 

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:35.969
 then there is the part of the beach and 

00:00:34.289 --> 00:00:37.829
 such the rock is pretty cool the map 

00:00:35.969 --> 00:00:39.570
 and some I have a demolition game 

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:41.550
 of pit you know that when they take a dlc 

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:43.289
 again because you put a moat would be if 

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:45.390
 they put a little bit of each game mode 

00:00:43.289 --> 00:00:47.340
 the maps and the exit I got demolition 

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:49.230
 I was playing only part of the house 

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:50.910
 with the nuclear dress drunk touch 

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:52.829
 so that song implemented from the 

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:54.870
 that you are cool and the truth is that it took me 

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:56.190
 a few uve schatz pulled me a couple 

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:57.929
 of times but not hungry right at the end 

00:00:56.190 --> 00:00:59.699
 of the gameplay or that the first part 

00:00:57.929 --> 00:01:01.320
 of the gameplay is a bit normal as well 

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:03.300
 I do not know exactly how well he answers 

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:04.619
 these maps are new and I do not know and 

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:06.329
 then you'll see that at the end of 

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:07.409
 example and start catching respond from 

00:01:06.329 --> 00:01:08.969
 a good way 

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:10.319
 I'm doing it right now it's been 

00:01:08.969 --> 00:01:11.579
 seen the gameplay continuously 

00:01:10.319 --> 00:01:13.140
 already trying to support him because he is 

00:01:11.579 --> 00:01:14.759
 where we really kill more as always 

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:16.140
 and well I'm watching me play with the 

00:01:14.759 --> 00:01:17.429
 scale with silencer and cylinder head 

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:18.869
 weapon that I like to use a lot because 

00:01:17.429 --> 00:01:20.189
 it is very powerful to open a bit of the 

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:21.659
 n-ii that has a bit more of the process 

00:01:20.189 --> 00:01:23.219
 that the n but has a little more than 

00:01:21.659 --> 00:01:25.079
 hurt and you see how even with vests you 

00:01:23.219 --> 00:01:26.849
 everything goes with killing me with a good c4 

00:01:25.079 --> 00:01:28.709
 I think that from now on they are not going to 

00:01:26.849 --> 00:01:30.209
 kill again I think I do not know 

00:01:28.709 --> 00:01:31.950
 exactly if it's like that but well I think 

00:01:30.209 --> 00:01:33.659
 I got a pretty good run of 25 

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:35.759
 high and I'm running out of time 

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:37.890
 the comrades placed the two bombs 

00:01:35.759 --> 00:01:39.060
 and took the game not bad luck and it's 

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:40.649
 what has to play only ways like 

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:42.750
 demolition not that it does not depend much 

00:01:40.649 --> 00:01:44.489
 of your team if they place the bombs on you 

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:45.989
 fuck the streak and even no more 

00:01:44.489 --> 00:01:47.549
 then good I leave you the game of 

00:01:45.989 --> 00:01:49.409
 background and I'm going to tell you a little about 

00:01:47.549 --> 00:01:51.030
 about the maps in general that have 

00:01:49.409 --> 00:01:52.950
 similar though it keeps going up as I continue 

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:54.179
 one of each one first of all we have 

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:55.979
 what I thought was a very map 

00:01:54.179 --> 00:01:57.149
 small and pretty cool the truth 

00:01:55.979 --> 00:01:58.469
 I really like how the part of the 

00:01:57.149 --> 00:02:00.450
 fullness that rocks and such is 

00:01:58.469 --> 00:02:02.489
 pretty curried then we have the map 

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:05.340
 of blink that would be the map that is the 

00:02:02.489 --> 00:02:07.200
 remodeling summit a map that to me 

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:08.489
 I like it a lot and it goes up a bit 

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:09.810
 Well not recently, not the last time 

00:02:08.489 --> 00:02:11.190
 I went up white I think it was on that map and 

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:12.540
 The truth is that also a map that 

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:13.960
 like it a lot and so we have a 

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:16.080
 handsome employment 

00:02:13.960 --> 00:02:19.150
 we do not have the spills that would be a 

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:21.640
 paintball paint forgiveness a field of 

00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:23.740
 paintball is a relatively map 

00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:25.240
 small is more or less that size what 

00:02:23.740 --> 00:02:28.120
 what happens that is more square is not more 

00:02:25.240 --> 00:02:29.740
 in a feeling range plan 

00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:31.210
 say it for the elements that there are because 

00:02:29.740 --> 00:02:33.400
 it's all like a test field of 

00:02:31.210 --> 00:02:34.900
 paint war and all that and then for 

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:36.250
 last we have the bridge map I do not know 

00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:38.980
 exactly what it's called right now is 

00:02:36.250 --> 00:02:40.090
 a bridge of noise that really is to me 

00:02:38.980 --> 00:02:41.380
 Enpa I did not like anything because it is 

00:02:40.090 --> 00:02:42.910
 too long and too much things 

00:02:41.380 --> 00:02:44.440
 to hide too many nooks and crannies 

00:02:42.910 --> 00:02:45.790
 many things to look at and it has already 

00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:46.990
 liked I do not like simpler maps 

00:02:45.790 --> 00:02:48.160
 how can this be even if it looks like a 

00:02:46.990 --> 00:02:50.020
 little complicated that is very much for 

00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:51.640
 looking really is very easy because 

00:02:50.020 --> 00:02:53.470
 you have the minimum up and really 

00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:56.080
 they are all rocks are circular parts and 

00:02:53.470 --> 00:02:57.430
 really quite easy to play this map 

00:02:56.080 --> 00:02:58.520
 I have not learned fast enough 

00:02:57.430 --> 00:03:00.770
 true 

00:02:58.520 --> 00:03:02.660
 and good playing with streaks like I said 

00:03:00.770 --> 00:03:04.460
 like a swarm of dogs and I know sometimes 

00:03:02.660 --> 00:03:06.260
 be tired, upload so many games or 

00:03:04.460 --> 00:03:07.490
 nuclear with the other gusts 

00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:08.990
 good these gusts that are a little 

00:03:07.490 --> 00:03:11.240
 kill more because I think you are cool too 

00:03:08.990 --> 00:03:12.710
 and well they are something harder to get out 

00:03:11.240 --> 00:03:14.300
 but once you take them out as you know 

00:03:12.710 --> 00:03:15.590
 if you get that they do not kill you then 

00:03:14.300 --> 00:03:17.090
 true that many chains 

00:03:15.590 --> 00:03:18.260
 gusts and do not stop killing you live at 

00:03:17.090 --> 00:03:20.570
 end of example and that I do not stop killing 

00:03:18.260 --> 00:03:22.790
 and well I had thought for tomorrow 

00:03:20.570 --> 00:03:24.200
 we went up a job in league mode so 

00:03:22.790 --> 00:03:26.270
 saturate both with new maps worth 

00:03:24.200 --> 00:03:28.280
 to be a little bit a take the flag 

00:03:26.270 --> 00:03:29.990
 pretty nice that I got out today 

00:03:28.280 --> 00:03:31.490
 apart you know that I'm preparing 

00:03:29.990 --> 00:03:32.780
 all the clips so league and 

00:03:31.490 --> 00:03:36.770
 competitive that I'm doing for 

00:03:32.780 --> 00:03:38.030
 when I have an editor, then make them do 

00:03:36.770 --> 00:03:39.530
 the assemblies for then for 

00:03:38.030 --> 00:03:41.690
 channel specials and all that several 

00:03:39.530 --> 00:03:42.950
 things and speaking special I think that already 

00:03:41.690 --> 00:03:44.120
 today we are going to get it 29 thousand 

00:03:42.950 --> 00:03:46.370
 subscribers so thank you very much 

00:03:44.120 --> 00:03:48.140
 everyone and you know that as soon as we get 

00:03:46.370 --> 00:03:50.090
 thousand more say when we reach 30,000 

00:03:48.140 --> 00:03:52.010
 you have the nuclear with reduced xp 

00:03:50.090 --> 00:03:53.750
 signed the 30 casualties with the x but as 

00:03:52.010 --> 00:03:55.880
 I told you nothing of the second 24 you see and that 

00:03:53.750 --> 00:03:57.230
 I still have some the area are important and 

00:03:55.880 --> 00:03:59.030
 well you should also clarify that it should be 

00:03:57.230 --> 00:04:01.070
 is the cinema mode like most of the 

00:03:59.030 --> 00:04:03.890
 times and this is due to two good things 

00:04:01.070 --> 00:04:04.790
 this the most important reason is that 

00:04:03.890 --> 00:04:06.530
 I have the computer 

00:04:04.790 --> 00:04:08.209
 As you know about samanes and I do not have 

00:04:06.530 --> 00:04:09.439
 of a lot of time to walk cleaning the 

00:04:08.209 --> 00:04:11.390
 computer is to say cleaning that I have 

00:04:09.439 --> 00:04:13.159
 to erase and look at me one thing at a time 

00:04:11.390 --> 00:04:14.780
 so I do not have time to organize everything 

00:04:13.159 --> 00:04:16.370
 and recorded the essentials then as 

00:04:14.780 --> 00:04:18.590
 having we have the white cinema mode 

00:04:16.370 --> 00:04:20.000
 2 I directly take it from the logo order the 

00:04:18.590 --> 00:04:21.680
 cinema mode and when I need it I take it out 

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:23.330
 not although sometimes it is a bit 

00:04:21.680 --> 00:04:24.560
 false for the subject for example like yesterday 

00:04:23.330 --> 00:04:25.759
 the nuclear that lasted for teams that 

00:04:24.560 --> 00:04:27.229
 because I liked it very much if I have not seen 

00:04:25.759 --> 00:04:29.240
 birds that you have the description the 

00:04:27.229 --> 00:04:30.860
 true that it was very good and the truth that 

00:04:29.240 --> 00:04:33.110
 sometimes it happens it seems that you kill evil 

00:04:30.860 --> 00:04:34.789
 many shots forgiveness of few shots or not 

00:04:33.110 --> 00:04:36.410
 you give them and those things so cinema a 

00:04:34.789 --> 00:04:37.759
 bit weird I think this movie mode 

00:04:36.410 --> 00:04:39.470
 is better done with the warfare modem 3 

00:04:37.759 --> 00:04:41.509
 I think that there is no doubt but it is still 

00:04:39.470 --> 00:04:43.009
 a little bit fake sometimes then in 

00:04:41.509 --> 00:04:44.960
 how much clean the computer will I try 

00:04:43.009 --> 00:04:46.400
 bring normal gameplays 

00:04:44.960 --> 00:04:47.930
 balanced with the calculator like the 

00:04:46.400 --> 00:04:49.370
 of competitive and always competitive 

00:04:47.930 --> 00:04:51.289
 they are recorded in capturing because 

00:04:49.370 --> 00:04:52.460
 whenever competitive play does not 

00:04:51.289 --> 00:04:53.599
 game to which I do not know which of the games 

00:04:52.460 --> 00:04:55.039
 because there are people who do not give you the 

00:04:53.599 --> 00:04:56.360
 games and if it's something cool then I 

00:04:55.039 --> 00:04:57.470
 like to keep it separate then it will have 

00:04:56.360 --> 00:04:59.360
 problems in case you have to claim the 

00:04:57.470 --> 00:05:00.889
 challenge or something whenever you have the 

00:04:59.360 --> 00:05:02.120
 capturer working and then if I 

00:05:00.889 --> 00:05:03.860
 nothing came out then directly with July 

00:05:02.120 --> 00:05:05.180
 hat that is what I should do for 

00:05:03.860 --> 00:05:06.349
 example equality as I suggested no and by 

00:05:05.180 --> 00:05:08.000
 What does not record if nothing comes out? 

00:05:06.349 --> 00:05:09.560
 It is really a little bit 

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:10.760
 all yes a little vague and it seems a bit 

00:05:09.560 --> 00:05:12.020
 of work 

00:05:10.760 --> 00:05:13.880
 it happens a little to do that because if not 

00:05:12.020 --> 00:05:16.010
 I have to be continuously recording 

00:05:13.880 --> 00:05:18.020
 erasing recording erasing and in the end it is 

00:05:16.010 --> 00:05:19.280
 a little scratched as well as the one that had the 

00:05:18.020 --> 00:05:20.990
 last moments of temper as soon as 

00:05:19.280 --> 00:05:23.030
 I put myself there in slaughter mode they give me there 

00:05:20.990 --> 00:05:24.890
 a couple of bullets and I hide with the 

00:05:23.030 --> 00:05:26.060
 rocks continually pianos the answer 

00:05:24.890 --> 00:05:28.190
 as you are seeing I am fully and 

00:05:26.060 --> 00:05:30.200
 answer the shit of the first round 

00:05:28.190 --> 00:05:31.700
 that trial uve sad maybe at the end of the 

00:05:30.200 --> 00:05:33.350
 first round I did not realize but good 

00:05:31.700 --> 00:05:34.910
 there you have a 20 bis streak like 

00:05:33.350 --> 00:05:36.200
 swarm and dogs do not stop killing 

00:05:34.910 --> 00:05:38.420
 in fact they jump me again 

00:05:36.200 --> 00:05:40.040
 the gusts I was left without even ammo 

00:05:38.420 --> 00:05:42.770
 I'm lucky I killed a friend 

00:05:40.040 --> 00:05:43.880
 I wanted him to catch his scavenger and it's good 

00:05:42.770 --> 00:05:45.260
 a bitch is not a game of 

00:05:43.880 --> 00:05:46.640
 enough casualties could have been more already 

00:05:45.260 --> 00:05:48.140
 that as you can see the game is pretty 

00:05:46.640 --> 00:05:49.580
 short one could long very much more 

00:05:48.140 --> 00:05:51.110
 like about the demolition games if 

00:05:49.580 --> 00:05:53.480
 you play with a team that does not go to 

00:05:51.110 --> 00:05:55.130
 place or not go to deactivate then 

00:05:53.480 --> 00:05:56.840
 they can last a lot but in this case 

00:05:55.130 --> 00:05:58.130
 since I was not in a team, so be it 

00:05:56.840 --> 00:05:59.660
 God want not here you see how we 

00:05:58.130 --> 00:06:01.400
 we put all the players in 

00:05:59.660 --> 00:06:02.510
 your support and even if it's demolition that 

00:06:01.400 --> 00:06:05.030
 makes the changes do not go well 

00:06:02.510 --> 00:06:07.160
 you see a 25- super-low streak that are 

00:06:05.030 --> 00:06:08.360
 six followed and the simple one ends 

00:06:07.160 --> 00:06:09.980
 Good thing you do not have to kill death 

00:06:08.360 --> 00:06:11.330
 be a motion I hope you liked this 

00:06:09.980 --> 00:06:13.310
 piece of gameplay and you liked it
