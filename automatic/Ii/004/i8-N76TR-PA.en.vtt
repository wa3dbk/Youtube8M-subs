00:00:00.050 --> 00:00:07.410
 iwata are wise we do not know if the 

00:00:04.860 --> 00:00:09.540
 blonde really have more fun than 

00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:11.400
 of brown hair but what is for sure 

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:14.190
 is that blondes tend to earn more 

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:16.560
 money and if you need to raise money 

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:18.690
 for some association it is also good 

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:20.970
 idea to send a blonde because people 

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:23.340
 tends to donate more to the people of 

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:25.620
 this student hair color 

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:27.960

00:00:25.620 --> 00:00:30.630
 they go well combed tend to have 

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:32.609
 better grades than those that go 

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:34.440
 intended I want to think about it well in 

00:00:32.609 --> 00:00:37.530
 the school the children always very well 

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:40.320
 primary in general people who 

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:43.230
 They are well-groomed to work well 

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:45.629
 combed I mean win between a 4 to 

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:48.329
 5 percent more than those who go 

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:50.579
 upset this is only name 

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:53.309
 that woman you're going to get fixed developed 

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:56.100
 you can fix you're going to win exactly 

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:59.399
 the same but if you're ugly you 

00:00:56.100 --> 00:01:00.839
 We recommend that you rappers totally 

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:03.449
 shaved of that will make you see more 

00:01:00.839 --> 00:01:04.050
 smart and so you can earn more 

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:05.670
 money 

00:01:04.050 --> 00:01:07.920
 sometimes asked about the 

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:11.160
 women like furry men or 

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:14.130
 cymbals then it turns out that it really does not 

00:01:11.160 --> 00:01:15.570
 can you say for sure if all 

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:18.750
 women are more attracted 

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:20.940
 towards men or hairy or hairless 

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:23.610
 because because women would see a lot 

00:01:20.940 --> 00:01:26.640
 according to the cycle in which we are and according to 

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:28.260
 also our dad if our dad was 

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:31.110
 a very hairy man the safest thing is 

00:01:28.260 --> 00:01:33.990
 that tend us to like furry men 

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:36.150
 but it's not always regular at all 

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:37.680
 our cycle there are moments of our 

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:40.140
 cycle usually when we are more 

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:42.570
 fertile we tend to look for men 

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:44.430
 more hairy more masculine while 

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:46.770
 when we are not in these moments 

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:49.140
 We tend to look for more men 

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:51.390
 hairless or become more feminine like this 

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:53.250
 Do not leave because of issues that 

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:56.250
 according to this it is fashionable to be more hairy 

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:59.070
 Martin to the woman varies too much 

00:01:56.250 --> 00:02:01.230
 people who paint their hair and who 

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:03.780
 they feel they look younger 

00:02:01.230 --> 00:02:05.730
 painting their hair tend to be 

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:08.100
 younger because as they feel the 

00:02:05.730 --> 00:02:10.410
 young men look younger 

00:02:08.100 --> 00:02:10.890
 tend to look for couples who have the 

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:13.620
 same 

00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:16.110
 hair color that your mom men 

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:18.720
 that have beards tend to look like 

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:20.760
 more social people while 

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:23.030
 men who only have a mustache 

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:26.040
 tend to be seen as more 

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:28.110
 introverted people tend to see 

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:30.270

 people perceive them as men more 

00:02:50.489 --> 00:02:56.610
 smart but if that person closed 

00:02:53.630 --> 00:03:00.239
