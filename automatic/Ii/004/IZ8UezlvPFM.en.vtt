00:00:59.849 --> 00:00:59.859 
added the sandstone stairs in to sort of

00:00:59.859 --> 00:01:01.649 
added the sandstone stairs in to sort of
get<00:00:59.980> that<00:01:00.010> feeling<00:01:00.370> but<00:01:00.730> some<00:01:01.089> of<00:01:01.210> it<00:01:01.300> has<00:01:01.420> been

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:01.659 
get that feeling but some of it has been

00:01:01.659 --> 00:01:03.689 
get that feeling but some of it has been
a<00:01:01.690> little<00:01:01.989> bit<00:01:02.289> destroyed<00:01:02.739> and<00:01:03.159> battered<00:01:03.550> way

00:01:03.689 --> 00:01:03.699 
a little bit destroyed and battered way

00:01:03.699 --> 00:01:05.460 
a little bit destroyed and battered way
over<00:01:04.059> time<00:01:04.390> which<00:01:04.659> is<00:01:04.780> probably<00:01:04.930> what<00:01:05.260> would

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:05.470 
over time which is probably what would

00:01:05.470 --> 00:01:07.200 
over time which is probably what would
have<00:01:05.650> happened<00:01:06.010> the<00:01:06.610> top<00:01:06.820> would<00:01:06.970> have<00:01:07.120> the

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:07.210 
have happened the top would have the

00:01:07.210 --> 00:01:08.910 
have happened the top would have the
arcs<00:01:07.630> as<00:01:07.810> you<00:01:07.900> can<00:01:08.050> see<00:01:08.230> there<00:01:08.410> and<00:01:08.800> we're

00:01:08.910 --> 00:01:08.920 
arcs as you can see there and we're

00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:10.050 
arcs as you can see there and we're
going<00:01:09.040> to<00:01:09.070> extend<00:01:09.250> the<00:01:09.460> wall<00:01:09.610> out<00:01:09.790> just<00:01:09.970> a

00:01:10.050 --> 00:01:10.060 
going to extend the wall out just a

00:01:10.060 --> 00:01:12.060 
going to extend the wall out just a
little<00:01:10.090> bit<00:01:10.450> here<00:01:10.900> from<00:01:11.230> the<00:01:11.380> main<00:01:11.800> part

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:12.070 
little bit here from the main part

00:01:12.070 --> 00:01:13.740 
little bit here from the main part
building<00:01:12.520> just<00:01:12.940> so<00:01:13.030> it<00:01:13.150> isn't<00:01:13.330> so<00:01:13.420> symmetrical

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:13.750 
building just so it isn't so symmetrical

00:01:13.750 --> 00:01:15.780 
building just so it isn't so symmetrical
and<00:01:14.290> gives<00:01:14.590> up<00:01:14.740> a<00:01:14.770> bit<00:01:14.980> more<00:01:15.130> than<00:01:15.310> butter<00:01:15.580> to

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:15.790 
and gives up a bit more than butter to

00:01:15.790 --> 00:01:18.870 
and gives up a bit more than butter to
feel<00:01:16.950> it's<00:01:17.950> gonna<00:01:18.040> continue<00:01:18.280> out<00:01:18.610> a<00:01:18.640> little

00:01:18.870 --> 00:01:18.880 
feel it's gonna continue out a little

00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:20.160 
feel it's gonna continue out a little
bit<00:01:19.060> further<00:01:19.300> now<00:01:19.540> and<00:01:19.780> you'll<00:01:19.900> see<00:01:20.050> it<00:01:20.140> will

00:01:20.160 --> 00:01:20.170 
bit further now and you'll see it will

00:01:20.170 --> 00:01:22.110 
bit further now and you'll see it will
connect<00:01:20.650> up<00:01:20.830> we<00:01:21.340> have<00:01:21.460> another<00:01:21.670> part<00:01:21.970> of<00:01:22.030> the

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:47.860 
castle could it wouldn't be so destroyed

00:01:47.860 --> 00:01:51.670 
castle could it wouldn't be so destroyed
on<00:01:48.070> this<00:01:48.220> side<00:01:48.430> like<00:01:48.670> I<00:01:48.880> said

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:54.030 
and then we come around suicide where

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:55.490 
and then we come around suicide where
we're<00:01:54.180> not<00:01:54.300> gonna<00:01:54.420> be<00:01:54.570> having<00:01:54.690> freearc<00:01:55.170> which

00:01:57.710 --> 00:01:57.720 
is gonna be having one little one but

00:01:57.720 --> 00:01:59.150 
is gonna be having one little one but
the<00:01:57.870> back<00:01:58.020> wall<00:01:58.290> here<00:01:58.320> was<00:01:58.650> going<00:01:58.830> to<00:01:58.920> be<00:01:58.980> near

00:01:59.150 --> 00:01:59.160 
the back wall here was going to be near

00:01:59.160 --> 00:02:00.950 
the back wall here was going to be near
enough<00:01:59.370> symmetrical<00:02:00.060> to<00:02:00.360> one<00:02:00.600> at<00:02:00.720> the<00:02:00.810> front

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:00.960 
enough symmetrical to one at the front

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:03.320 
enough symmetrical to one at the front
three<00:02:01.560> arcs<00:02:01.860> at<00:02:02.010> the<00:02:02.100> top<00:02:02.280> but<00:02:02.880> of<00:02:02.940> course<00:02:03.180> it

00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:03.330 
three arcs at the top but of course it

00:02:03.330 --> 00:02:04.670 
three arcs at the top but of course it
wouldn't<00:02:03.480> be<00:02:03.600> symmetrical<00:02:04.140> when<00:02:04.260> it<00:02:04.350> came<00:02:04.500> to

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:04.680 
wouldn't be symmetrical when it came to

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:06.350 
wouldn't be symmetrical when it came to
the<00:02:04.770> little<00:02:04.860> details<00:02:05.430> this<00:02:05.910> hands<00:02:06.180> those

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:06.360 
the little details this hands those

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:08.450 
the little details this hands those

cracks and stuff would be in different
places<00:02:10.380> and<00:02:10.770> a<00:02:10.830> bit<00:02:11.220> so<00:02:11.340> it<00:02:11.460> would<00:02:11.730> be<00:02:11.880> fallen

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:12.270 
places and a bit so it would be fallen

00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:14.000 
places and a bit so it would be fallen
off<00:02:12.450> but<00:02:12.750> all<00:02:13.080> in<00:02:13.230> all<00:02:13.320> it<00:02:13.500> still<00:02:13.680> looks<00:02:13.920> really

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:14.010 
off but all in all it still looks really

00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:16.390

00:02:46.990 --> 00:02:47.000 
I've until me bringing up another wall

00:03:05.330 --> 00:03:07.600 
where we're building next to if I forgot
safe<00:03:05.569> start<00:03:05.930> this<00:03:06.590> wall<00:03:06.830> was<00:03:06.950> going<00:03:07.129> up<00:03:07.280> fairly

00:03:07.600 --> 00:03:07.610 
safe start this wall was going up fairly

00:03:07.610 --> 00:03:13.150 
safe start this wall was going up fairly
high<00:03:10.060> and<00:03:11.060> he<00:03:11.840> said<00:03:12.019> well<00:03:12.290> that<00:03:12.560> is<00:03:12.709> it<00:03:12.799> in<00:03:12.980> a

00:03:13.150 --> 00:03:13.160 
high and he said well that is it in a

00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:15.640 
high and he said well that is it in a
nice<00:03:13.370> little<00:03:13.519> stone<00:03:13.940> and<00:03:14.209> gravel<00:03:14.629> floor<00:03:15.349> bet

00:03:15.640 --> 00:03:15.650 
nice little stone and gravel floor bet

00:03:15.650 --> 00:03:17.620 
nice little stone and gravel floor bet
it's<00:03:16.129> gonna<00:03:16.310> bring<00:03:16.519> the<00:03:16.670> wall<00:03:16.849> along<00:03:17.239> a<00:03:17.299> bit<00:03:17.540> at

00:03:17.620 --> 00:03:17.630 
it's gonna bring the wall along a bit at

00:03:17.630 --> 00:03:19.870 
it's gonna bring the wall along a bit at
the<00:03:17.660> back<00:03:17.930> here<00:03:18.260> and<00:03:19.130> they'll<00:03:19.370> just<00:03:19.400> spin<00:03:19.760> the

00:03:19.870 --> 00:03:19.880 
the back here and they'll just spin the

00:03:19.880 --> 00:03:21.550 
the back here and they'll just spin the
camera<00:03:20.150> round<00:03:20.299> well<00:03:20.690> but<00:03:20.870> will<00:03:21.230> we<00:03:21.349> sort<00:03:21.530> of

00:03:21.550 --> 00:03:21.560 
camera round well but will we sort of

00:03:21.560 --> 00:03:23.410 
camera round well but will we sort of
have<00:03:21.680> any<00:03:21.769> other<00:03:22.160> half<00:03:22.579> of<00:03:22.849> the<00:03:23.000> castle<00:03:23.360> I

00:03:23.410 --> 00:03:23.420 
have any other half of the castle I

00:03:23.420 --> 00:03:25.210 
have any other half of the castle I
guess<00:03:23.630> because<00:03:24.260> the<00:03:24.410> sort<00:03:24.680> of<00:03:24.739> middle<00:03:24.980> part

00:03:25.210 --> 00:03:25.220 
guess because the sort of middle part

00:03:25.220 --> 00:03:27.220 
guess because the sort of middle part
was<00:03:25.370> going<00:03:25.519> to<00:03:25.670> be<00:03:25.760> sort<00:03:25.940> of<00:03:26.000> all<00:03:26.269> open<00:03:27.049> and

00:03:27.220 --> 00:03:27.230 
was going to be sort of all open and

00:03:27.230 --> 00:03:29.589 
was going to be sort of all open and
clear<00:03:27.590> and<00:03:27.920> we<00:03:27.980> sought<00:03:28.970> the<00:03:29.000> castle

00:03:29.589 --> 00:03:29.599 
clear and we sought the castle

00:03:29.599 --> 00:03:31.270 
clear and we sought the castle
surrounded<00:03:29.750> it<00:03:30.260> if<00:03:30.379> that<00:03:30.560> makes<00:03:30.739> sense<00:03:30.799> it

00:03:31.270 --> 00:03:31.280 
surrounded it if that makes sense it

00:03:31.280 --> 00:03:33.460 
surrounded it if that makes sense it
would<00:03:31.370> act<00:03:31.579> like<00:03:31.670> a<00:03:31.790> bit<00:03:32.000> of<00:03:32.060> a<00:03:32.120> courtyard<00:03:32.470> this

00:03:33.460 --> 00:03:33.470 
would act like a bit of a courtyard this

00:03:33.470 --> 00:03:34.900 
would act like a bit of a courtyard this
castle<00:03:33.860> though<00:03:33.980> this<00:03:34.129> is<00:03:34.220> simply<00:03:34.549> a<00:03:34.610> bit<00:03:34.730> of<00:03:34.819> a

00:03:34.900 --> 00:03:34.910 
castle though this is simply a bit of a

00:03:34.910 --> 00:03:37.030 
castle though this is simply a bit of a
wall<00:03:35.120> it<00:03:35.360> wasn't<00:03:35.690> anything<00:03:35.900> too<00:03:36.349> big<00:03:36.620> but<00:03:36.920> it

00:03:37.030 --> 00:03:37.040 
wall it wasn't anything too big but it

00:03:37.040 --> 00:03:38.650 
wall it wasn't anything too big but it
still<00:03:37.250> looked<00:03:37.489> quite<00:03:37.819> nice<00:03:38.060> to<00:03:38.239> actually<00:03:38.299> look

00:03:38.650 --> 00:03:38.660 
still looked quite nice to actually look

00:03:38.660 --> 00:03:40.150 
still looked quite nice to actually look
out<00:03:38.810> I<00:03:38.870> thought<00:03:39.170> it<00:03:39.379> gave<00:03:39.500> a<00:03:39.560> nice<00:03:39.739> sense<00:03:40.010> of

00:03:40.150 --> 00:03:40.160 
out I thought it gave a nice sense of

00:03:40.160 --> 00:03:42.220 
out I thought it gave a nice sense of
the<00:03:40.250> levels<00:03:40.610> next<00:03:41.360> is<00:03:41.450> really<00:03:41.750> a<00:03:41.810> long<00:03:42.019> time

00:03:42.220 --> 00:03:42.230 
the levels next is really a long time

00:03:42.230 --> 00:03:43.780 
the levels next is really a long time
where<00:03:42.410> we<00:03:42.500> had<00:03:42.620> in<00:03:42.739> the<00:03:42.799> distance<00:03:43.160> there<00:03:43.340> and

00:03:43.780 --> 00:03:43.790 
where we had in the distance there and

00:03:43.790 --> 00:03:45.369 
where we had in the distance there and
it's<00:03:44.120> slightly<00:03:44.390> smaller<00:03:44.660> little<00:03:45.079> wall

00:03:45.369 --> 00:03:45.379 
it's slightly smaller little wall

00:03:45.379 --> 00:03:47.500 
it's slightly smaller little wall
section<00:03:45.829> one<00:03:46.459> building<00:03:46.760> here<00:03:47.030> is<00:03:47.209> gonna<00:03:47.329> be

00:03:47.500 --> 00:03:47.510 
section one building here is gonna be

00:03:47.510 --> 00:03:49.720 
section one building here is gonna be
like<00:03:47.629> the<00:03:47.750> main<00:03:47.900> entrance<00:03:48.500> of<00:03:48.650> castle<00:03:49.130> now<00:03:49.579> it

00:03:49.720 --> 00:03:49.730 
like the main entrance of castle now it

00:03:49.730 --> 00:03:51.280 
like the main entrance of castle now it
would<00:03:49.880> have<00:03:49.970> been<00:03:50.090> entered<00:03:50.510> in<00:03:50.720> from<00:03:50.989> this

00:03:51.280 --> 00:03:51.290 
would have been entered in from this

00:03:51.290 --> 00:03:53.289 
would have been entered in from this
side<00:03:51.350> back<00:03:51.980> in<00:03:52.130> the<00:03:52.190> medieval<00:03:52.430> days<00:03:52.609> but

00:03:53.289 --> 00:03:53.299 
side back in the medieval days but

00:03:53.299 --> 00:03:54.580 
side back in the medieval days but
because<00:03:53.389> all<00:03:53.630> the<00:03:53.690> trees<00:03:53.930> and<00:03:53.959> lands<00:03:54.350> all

00:03:54.580 --> 00:03:54.590 
because all the trees and lands all

00:03:54.590 --> 00:03:56.020 
because all the trees and lands all
changed<00:03:55.040> it<00:03:55.160> doesn't<00:03:55.459> really<00:03:55.549> look<00:03:55.790> like<00:03:55.850> a

00:03:56.020 --> 00:03:56.030 
changed it doesn't really look like a

00:03:56.030 --> 00:03:57.940 
changed it doesn't really look like a
good<00:03:56.269> entrance<00:03:56.569> now<00:03:56.810> just<00:03:57.530> sort<00:03:57.709> of<00:03:57.769> what<00:03:57.920> I

underneath that main tower part which I

00:04:23.090 --> 00:04:24.430 
underneath that main tower part which I
was<00:04:23.270> building<00:04:23.599> earlier<00:04:23.900> which<00:04:24.050> you'll<00:04:24.169> see<00:04:24.200> in

00:04:24.430 --> 00:04:24.440 
was building earlier which you'll see in

00:04:24.440 --> 00:04:26.980 
was building earlier which you'll see in
a<00:04:24.500> minute<00:04:24.910> that<00:04:25.910> is<00:04:26.060> a<00:04:26.090> few<00:04:26.330> chests<00:04:26.690> i<00:04:26.750> didäôt

00:04:26.980 --> 00:04:26.990 
a minute that is a few chests i didäôt

00:04:26.990 --> 00:04:28.120 
a minute that is a few chests i didäôt
spawner<00:04:27.410> in<00:04:27.650> a<00:04:27.710> minute

00:04:28.120 --> 00:04:28.130 
spawner in a minute

00:04:28.130 --> 00:04:30.310 
spawner in a minute
or<00:04:28.280> couple<00:04:28.820> actually<00:04:28.970> and<00:04:29.750> you<00:04:29.840> can<00:04:29.870> see<00:04:30.020> where

00:04:30.310 --> 00:04:30.320 
or couple actually and you can see where

00:04:30.320 --> 00:04:32.860 
or couple actually and you can see where
we<00:04:30.440> are<00:04:30.560> now<00:04:30.800> sort<00:04:31.700> of<00:04:31.789> up<00:04:32.090> those<00:04:32.419> stairs<00:04:32.660> and

00:04:32.860 --> 00:04:32.870 
we are now sort of up those stairs and

00:04:32.870 --> 00:04:34.390 
we are now sort of up those stairs and
over<00:04:33.020> the<00:04:33.169> wall<00:04:33.349> is<00:04:33.560> where<00:04:33.680> the<00:04:33.770> fire<00:04:33.950> station

00:04:34.390 --> 00:04:34.400 
over the wall is where the fire station

00:04:34.400 --> 00:04:35.800 
over the wall is where the fire station
is<00:04:34.550> so<00:04:34.729> that's<00:04:34.910> the<00:04:34.970> direction<00:04:35.240> we're<00:04:35.539> looking

00:04:35.800 --> 00:04:35.810 
is so that's the direction we're looking
