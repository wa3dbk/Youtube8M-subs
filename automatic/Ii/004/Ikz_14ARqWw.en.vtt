hey y'all Mike again from fierce rods

00:00:02.010 --> 00:00:05.539 
hey y'all Mike again from fierce rods
we're<00:00:02.939> going<00:00:03.179> to<00:00:03.389> do<00:00:03.929> a<00:00:04.200> rod<00:00:04.740> holder<00:00:05.069> install

00:00:05.539 --> 00:00:05.549 
we're going to do a rod holder install

00:00:05.549 --> 00:00:09.049 
we're going to do a rod holder install
on<00:00:05.730> my<00:00:05.759> wife's<00:00:06.000> brand<00:00:06.330> new<00:00:06.420> day<00:00:06.600> 10<00:00:07.820> we<00:00:08.820> got<00:00:08.970> the

00:00:09.049 --> 00:00:09.059 
on my wife's brand new day 10 we got the

00:00:09.059 --> 00:00:11.390 
on my wife's brand new day 10 we got the
pattern<00:00:09.450> for<00:00:09.660> the<00:00:09.780> rod<00:00:10.410> holder<00:00:10.800> it's<00:00:11.160> not

00:00:11.390 --> 00:00:11.400 
pattern for the rod holder it's not

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:12.980 
pattern for the rod holder it's not
perfectly<00:00:11.910> round<00:00:12.030> like<00:00:12.420> the<00:00:12.540> bottom<00:00:12.809> of<00:00:12.900> this

00:00:12.980 --> 00:00:12.990 
perfectly round like the bottom of this

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:15.829 
perfectly round like the bottom of this
is<00:00:13.170> because<00:00:13.380> when<00:00:13.530> you<00:00:14.089> tip<00:00:15.089> it<00:00:15.120> to<00:00:15.450> put<00:00:15.630> it<00:00:15.750> on

00:00:15.829 --> 00:00:15.839 
is because when you tip it to put it on

00:00:15.839 --> 00:00:19.070 
is because when you tip it to put it on
angle<00:00:16.440> it<00:00:16.680> becomes<00:00:16.949> oval<00:00:17.369> so<00:00:18.270> the<00:00:18.510> rod<00:00:18.840> holder

00:00:19.070 --> 00:00:19.080 
angle it becomes oval so the rod holder

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:21.380 
angle it becomes oval so the rod holder
comes<00:00:19.260> with<00:00:19.380> a<00:00:19.410> pattern<00:00:19.880> so<00:00:20.880> what<00:00:20.970> I<00:00:21.060> like<00:00:21.240> to

00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:21.390 
comes with a pattern so what I like to

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:22.640 
comes with a pattern so what I like to
do<00:00:21.510> is<00:00:21.689> if<00:00:21.840> something<00:00:22.170> I've<00:00:22.260> never<00:00:22.380> done

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:22.650 
do is if something I've never done

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:25.160 
do is if something I've never done
before<00:00:22.789> instead<00:00:23.789> of<00:00:23.939> ruining<00:00:24.180> the<00:00:24.449> kayak<00:00:24.930> I

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:25.170 
before instead of ruining the kayak I

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:26.810 
before instead of ruining the kayak I
start<00:00:25.800> out<00:00:25.890> on<00:00:26.070> piece<00:00:26.220> of<00:00:26.250> wood<00:00:26.519> so<00:00:26.550> we're

00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:26.820 
start out on piece of wood so we're

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:28.310 
start out on piece of wood so we're
going<00:00:26.910> to<00:00:26.970> do<00:00:27.119> a<00:00:27.150> test<00:00:27.480> cut<00:00:27.750> first<00:00:28.019> just<00:00:28.260> to

00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:28.320 
going to do a test cut first just to

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:29.660 
going to do a test cut first just to
make<00:00:28.470> sure<00:00:28.500> that<00:00:28.769> the<00:00:28.859> whole<00:00:29.010> saw<00:00:29.220> we<00:00:29.369> got<00:00:29.519> the

00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:29.670 
make sure that the whole saw we got the

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:30.830 
make sure that the whole saw we got the
correct<00:00:29.880> size<00:00:30.119> and<00:00:30.150> everything<00:00:30.480> is<00:00:30.660> going<00:00:30.810> to

00:00:30.830 --> 00:00:30.840 
correct size and everything is going to

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:31.970 
correct size and everything is going to
go<00:00:30.990> like<00:00:31.170> it's<00:00:31.320> supposed<00:00:31.619> to

00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:31.980 
go like it's supposed to

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:33.799 
go like it's supposed to
so<00:00:32.550> it<00:00:32.610> should<00:00:32.759> usually<00:00:32.880> your<00:00:33.180> pattern<00:00:33.510> on<00:00:33.630> the

00:00:33.799 --> 00:00:33.809 
so it should usually your pattern on the

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:44.360 
so it should usually your pattern on the
wood<00:00:34.550> trace<00:00:35.550> it<00:00:35.730> out<00:00:42.890> as<00:00:43.890> you<00:00:44.010> can<00:00:44.040> see<00:00:44.250> it's

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:44.370 
wood trace it out as you can see it's

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:46.520 
wood trace it out as you can see it's
not<00:00:44.579> round<00:00:44.879> it's<00:00:45.059> oval<00:00:45.420> take<00:00:46.020> your<00:00:46.170> hole<00:00:46.289> saw

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:46.530 
not round it's oval take your hole saw

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:50.779 
not round it's oval take your hole saw
line<00:00:47.399> it<00:00:47.550> up<00:00:47.640> with<00:00:47.789> the<00:00:47.969> backside<00:00:49.520> so<00:00:50.520> the<00:00:50.640> rod

00:00:50.779 --> 00:00:50.789 
line it up with the backside so the rod

00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:53.090 
line it up with the backside so the rod
holders<00:00:51.090> gonna<00:00:51.270> sit<00:00:51.449> this<00:00:51.660> way<00:00:51.899> so<00:00:52.890> you<00:00:52.980> got

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:53.100 
holders gonna sit this way so you got

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:54.410 
holders gonna sit this way so you got
three<00:00:53.340> holes<00:00:53.550> you<00:00:53.760> want<00:00:53.940> to<00:00:54.000> start<00:00:54.239> with<00:00:54.360> the

00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:54.420 
three holes you want to start with the

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:56.720 
three holes you want to start with the
number<00:00:54.660> one<00:00:54.809> hole<00:00:55.020> is<00:00:55.199> that<00:00:55.829> way<00:00:56.010> the<00:00:56.160> way<00:00:56.610> the

00:00:56.720 --> 00:00:56.730 
number one hole is that way the way the

00:00:56.730 --> 00:00:59.979 
number one hole is that way the way the
rod<00:00:56.879> is<00:00:57.030> going<00:00:57.180> to<00:00:57.270> point<00:00:57.890> start<00:00:58.890> on<00:00:58.980> that<00:00:59.129> side

00:00:59.979 --> 00:00:59.989 
rod is going to point start on that side

00:00:59.989 --> 00:01:01.910 
rod is going to point start on that side
little<00:01:00.989> bit<00:01:01.109> goes<00:01:01.320> in<00:01:01.530> there<00:01:01.680> that<00:01:01.800> you're

00:01:27.870 --> 00:01:27.880 
now what happened is the drill bit will

00:01:27.880 --> 00:01:29.490 
now what happened is the drill bit will
go<00:01:27.909> so<00:01:28.210> far<00:01:28.240> the<00:01:28.600> piece<00:01:28.780> of<00:01:28.929> wood<00:01:29.020> inside<00:01:29.409> is

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:29.500 
go so far the piece of wood inside is

00:01:29.500 --> 00:01:31.230 
go so far the piece of wood inside is
gonna<00:01:29.649> hit<00:01:29.890> the<00:01:29.920> back<00:01:30.159> of<00:01:30.189> the<00:01:30.340> drill<00:01:30.549> bit<00:01:30.579> it

00:01:31.230 --> 00:01:31.240 
gonna hit the back of the drill bit it

00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:32.609 
gonna hit the back of the drill bit it
won't<00:01:31.420> go<00:01:31.600> any<00:01:31.780> further<00:01:31.929> so<00:01:32.200> what<00:01:32.320> you<00:01:32.409> do<00:01:32.530> is

these<00:06:06.590> are<00:06:06.740> countersunk<00:06:07.280> screws<00:06:07.670> because<00:06:08.030> the

00:06:08.140 --> 00:06:08.150 
these are countersunk screws because the
