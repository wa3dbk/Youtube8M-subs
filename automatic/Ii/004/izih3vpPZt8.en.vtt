00:00:01.850 --> 00:00:07.070 

this<00:00:02.870> tumor<00:00:03.870> is<00:00:04.470> shaped<00:00:05.130> like<00:00:05.460> a<00:00:05.879> hot<00:00:06.180> dog<00:00:06.210> and

00:00:07.070 --> 00:00:07.080 
this tumor is shaped like a hot dog and

00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:11.240 
this tumor is shaped like a hot dog and
has<00:00:07.680> very<00:00:08.269> sharp<00:00:09.269> margins<00:00:09.929> it's<00:00:10.590> not<00:00:10.860> because

00:00:11.240 --> 00:00:11.250 
has very sharp margins it's not because

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:13.879 
has very sharp margins it's not because
it's<00:00:11.429> the<00:00:11.580> whole<00:00:11.730> tumor<00:00:12.120> but<00:00:13.019> it's<00:00:13.200> because<00:00:13.559> it

00:00:13.879 --> 00:00:13.889 
it's the whole tumor but it's because it

00:00:13.889 --> 00:00:16.189 
it's the whole tumor but it's because it
was<00:00:14.099> biopsied<00:00:14.790> with<00:00:15.030> the<00:00:15.150> needle<00:00:15.480> so<00:00:15.839> this<00:00:16.020> is

00:00:16.189 --> 00:00:16.199 
was biopsied with the needle so this is

00:00:16.199 --> 00:00:18.109 
was biopsied with the needle so this is
the<00:00:16.320> core<00:00:16.590> of<00:00:16.619> the<00:00:16.949> needle<00:00:17.279> looks<00:00:17.789> like<00:00:17.970> it

00:00:18.109 --> 00:00:18.119 
the core of the needle looks like it

00:00:18.119 --> 00:00:19.910 
the core of the needle looks like it
could<00:00:18.300> be<00:00:18.330> maybe<00:00:18.930> three<00:00:19.080> millimeters

00:00:19.910 --> 00:00:19.920 
could be maybe three millimeters

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:22.460 
could be maybe three millimeters
approximately<00:00:20.850> which<00:00:21.480> needles<00:00:21.869> usually<00:00:22.260> are

00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:22.470 
approximately which needles usually are

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:24.830 
approximately which needles usually are
if<00:00:22.680> they're<00:00:22.859> big<00:00:23.100> maybe<00:00:23.789> two<00:00:24.269> or<00:00:24.420> one<00:00:24.630> if

00:00:24.830 --> 00:00:24.840 
if they're big maybe two or one if

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:26.080 
if they're big maybe two or one if
they're<00:00:25.019> smaller

00:00:26.080 --> 00:00:26.090 
they're smaller

00:00:26.090 --> 00:00:29.900 
they're smaller
notice<00:00:27.090> that<00:00:27.420> the<00:00:27.720> tumor<00:00:28.199> itself<00:00:28.490> is<00:00:29.490> not

00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:29.910 
notice that the tumor itself is not

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:32.870 
notice that the tumor itself is not
nodular<00:00:30.660> it's<00:00:31.260> rather<00:00:31.560> a<00:00:31.740> uniform<00:00:32.399> there's<00:00:32.820> a

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:32.880 
nodular it's rather a uniform there's a

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:35.180 
nodular it's rather a uniform there's a
lot<00:00:33.149> of<00:00:33.270> fibrous<00:00:33.660> tissue<00:00:33.930> in<00:00:34.170> it<00:00:34.290> and<00:00:34.829> it<00:00:34.980> does

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:35.190 
lot of fibrous tissue in it and it does

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:39.860 
lot of fibrous tissue in it and it does
not<00:00:35.370> at<00:00:35.640> all<00:00:35.880> form<00:00:36.739> any<00:00:37.739> type<00:00:38.070> of<00:00:38.390> natural<00:00:39.390> or

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:39.870 
not at all form any type of natural or

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:43.430 
not at all form any type of natural or
follicle<00:00:40.469> also<00:00:41.309> notice<00:00:41.760> that<00:00:42.660> from<00:00:43.230> your

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:43.440 
follicle also notice that from your

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:45.680 
follicle also notice that from your
intense<00:00:43.980> experience<00:00:44.760> you<00:00:45.030> might<00:00:45.270> get<00:00:45.510> the

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:45.690 
intense experience you might get the

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:47.990 
intense experience you might get the
impression<00:00:45.930> that<00:00:46.559> maybe<00:00:46.980> these<00:00:47.250> are<00:00:47.460> lymphoid

00:00:47.990 --> 00:00:48.000 
impression that maybe these are lymphoid

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:52.670 
impression that maybe these are lymphoid
cells<00:00:48.780> rather<00:00:49.770> than<00:00:50.570> epithelial<00:00:51.570> cells<00:00:51.870> so

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:52.680 
cells rather than epithelial cells so

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:54.560 
cells rather than epithelial cells so
maybe<00:00:53.219> you're<00:00:53.460> dealing<00:00:53.760> with<00:00:53.789> a<00:00:53.910> lymphoma

00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:54.570 
maybe you're dealing with a lymphoma

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:57.470 
maybe you're dealing with a lymphoma
rather<00:00:55.050> than<00:00:55.289> a<00:00:55.379> carcinoma<00:00:55.890> however<00:00:56.460> even<00:00:57.300> an

00:00:57.470 --> 00:00:57.480 
rather than a carcinoma however even an

00:00:57.480 --> 00:00:59.959 
rather than a carcinoma however even an
experienced<00:00:58.230> pathologist<00:00:59.160> like<00:00:59.430> I<00:00:59.460> think<00:00:59.820> I

00:00:59.959 --> 00:00:59.969 
experienced pathologist like I think I

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:02.660 
experienced pathologist like I think I
am<00:01:00.180> will<00:01:01.050> tell<00:01:01.320> you<00:01:01.469> in<00:01:01.620> all<00:01:01.800> honesty<00:01:01.829> this

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:02.670 
am will tell you in all honesty this

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:05.299 
am will tell you in all honesty this
still<00:01:02.879> could<00:01:03.180> be<00:01:03.239> carcinoma<00:01:04.199> so<00:01:04.739> you<00:01:04.799> then

00:01:05.299 --> 00:01:05.309 
still could be carcinoma so you then

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:07.750 
still could be carcinoma so you then
instantly<00:01:05.700> go<00:01:06.060> into<00:01:06.090> your<00:01:06.420> bag<00:01:06.659> of<00:01:06.840> tricks<00:01:07.080> and

00:01:07.750 --> 00:01:07.760 
instantly go into your bag of tricks and

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:10.100 
instantly go into your bag of tricks and
look<00:01:08.760> in<00:01:08.970> stain<00:01:09.420> these<00:01:09.630> things<00:01:09.930> with

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:10.110 
look in stain these things with

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:12.560 
look in stain these things with
epithelials<00:01:10.950> markers<00:01:11.640> versus<00:01:12.119> lymphoid

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:12.570 
epithelials markers versus lymphoid

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:14.750 
epithelials markers versus lymphoid
markers<00:01:13.170> and<00:01:13.380> if<00:01:13.860> the<00:01:13.979> empathy<00:01:14.549> allele

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:14.760 
markers and if the empathy allele

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:16.910 
markers and if the empathy allele
markers<00:01:15.630> are<00:01:15.810> negative<00:01:16.259> and<00:01:16.409> the<00:01:16.530> lymphoid

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:16.920 
markers are negative and the lymphoid

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:18.530 
markers are negative and the lymphoid
markers<00:01:17.400> are<00:01:17.580> generally<00:01:17.970> positive<00:01:18.420> you<00:01:18.509> know

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:18.540 
markers are generally positive you know

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:20.510 
markers are generally positive you know
it's<00:01:18.780> a<00:01:18.840> lymphoma<00:01:19.290> and<00:01:19.860> really<00:01:20.130> that's<00:01:20.340> all

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:20.520 
it's a lymphoma and really that's all

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:22.700 
it's a lymphoma and really that's all
you<00:01:20.729> do<00:01:20.939> know<00:01:21.150> and<00:01:21.479> if<00:01:21.869> you<00:01:21.990> do<00:01:22.140> stay<00:01:22.409> in<00:01:22.470> these

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:22.710 
you do know and if you do stay in these

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:25.010 
you do know and if you do stay in these
cells<00:01:23.520> now<00:01:24.000> that<00:01:24.180> you<00:01:24.240> know<00:01:24.360> it's<00:01:24.509> a<00:01:24.600> lymphoma

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:25.020 
cells now that you know it's a lymphoma

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:27.830 
cells now that you know it's a lymphoma
with<00:01:25.860> t-cell<00:01:26.400> and<00:01:26.580> b-cell<00:01:26.670> markers<00:01:27.509> and<00:01:27.720> they

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:27.840 
with t-cell and b-cell markers and they

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:31.789 
with t-cell and b-cell markers and they
happen<00:01:28.170> to<00:01:28.350> stain<00:01:29.100> with<00:01:29.939> the<00:01:30.180> B<00:01:31.079> cell<00:01:31.320> markers

00:01:31.789 --> 00:01:31.799 
happen to stain with the B cell markers

00:01:31.799 --> 00:01:34.670 
happen to stain with the B cell markers
and<00:01:31.979> you<00:01:32.040> could<00:01:32.189> call<00:01:32.340> it<00:01:32.520> a<00:01:32.670> diffuse<00:01:33.680> large

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:34.680 
and you could call it a diffuse large

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:38.390 
and you could call it a diffuse large
