00:00:28.770 --> 00:00:30.620 
but the mustache haven't used it in a
while<00:00:28.829> but<00:00:28.980> I<00:00:29.579> think<00:00:29.970> it's<00:00:30.059> bad<00:00:30.210> luck<00:00:30.270> because

00:00:30.620 --> 00:00:30.630 
while but I think it's bad luck because

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:32.990 
while but I think it's bad luck because
every<00:00:30.930> time<00:00:30.960> I<00:00:31.169> run<00:00:32.099> it<00:00:32.279> for<00:00:32.430> one<00:00:32.579> weekend<00:00:32.940> I

00:00:32.990 --> 00:00:33.000 
every time I run it for one weekend I

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:34.870 
every time I run it for one weekend I
don't<00:00:33.180> do<00:00:33.300> very<00:00:33.450> good<00:00:33.750> and<00:00:33.960> yesterday<00:00:34.559> was<00:00:34.710> a

00:00:34.870 --> 00:00:34.880 
don't do very good and yesterday was a

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:37.700 
don't do very good and yesterday was a
another<00:00:35.880> day<00:00:36.090> so<00:00:37.020> you're<00:00:37.140> gonna<00:00:37.230> shave<00:00:37.469> it<00:00:37.590> off

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:37.710

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:40.579 
another day so you're gonna shave it off
for<00:00:38.070> the<00:00:38.130> next<00:00:38.219> one<00:00:38.460> I<00:00:38.750> don't<00:00:39.750> know<00:00:39.839> I<00:00:39.870> get<00:00:40.440> this

00:00:40.579 --> 00:00:40.589 
for the next one I don't know I get this

00:00:40.589 --> 00:00:42.889 
for the next one I don't know I get this
much<00:00:40.769> time<00:00:41.039> invested<00:00:41.879> and<00:00:42.000> I<00:00:42.059> like<00:00:42.239> to<00:00:42.420> keep<00:00:42.780> it

00:00:42.889 --> 00:00:42.899 
much time invested and I like to keep it

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:47.029 
much time invested and I like to keep it
going<00:00:43.140> for<00:00:43.410> a<00:00:44.010> little<00:00:44.160> while<00:00:44.309> but<00:00:45.260> you<00:00:46.260> know<00:00:46.379> my

00:00:47.029 --> 00:00:47.039 
going for a little while but you know my

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:48.709 
going for a little while but you know my
girlfriend's<00:00:47.550> not<00:00:47.699> real<00:00:47.879> happy<00:00:47.969> about<00:00:48.179> it<00:00:48.510> but

00:00:48.709 --> 00:00:48.719 
girlfriend's not real happy about it but

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:51.799 
girlfriend's not real happy about it but
no<00:00:49.320> I<00:00:49.620> think<00:00:50.039> it<00:00:50.129> looks<00:00:50.280> good<00:00:50.460> though<00:00:50.789> well<00:00:51.780> I

00:00:51.799 --> 00:00:51.809 
no I think it looks good though well I

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:53.029 
no I think it looks good though well I
think<00:00:51.960> the<00:00:52.170> girlfriend<00:00:52.530> should<00:00:52.710> probably<00:00:52.980> get

00:00:53.029 --> 00:00:53.039 
think the girlfriend should probably get

00:00:53.039 --> 00:00:55.009 
think the girlfriend should probably get
the<00:00:53.159> final<00:00:53.339> say<00:00:53.460> in<00:00:53.969> the<00:00:54.239> whole<00:00:54.390> matter<00:00:54.600> but

00:00:55.009 --> 00:00:55.019 
the final say in the whole matter but

00:00:55.019 --> 00:00:57.950 
the final say in the whole matter but
