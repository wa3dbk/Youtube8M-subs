make things right football booty from
the<00:03:03.540> show<00:03:03.780> and<00:03:04.049> food<00:03:04.379> it<00:03:04.530> in<00:03:04.680> here<00:03:04.919> in<00:03:05.010> Canada

00:03:06.819 --> 00:03:06.829 
the show and food it in here in Canada

00:03:06.829 --> 00:03:09.319 
the show and food it in here in Canada
last<00:03:07.829> year<00:03:08.129> we<00:03:08.280> had<00:03:08.459> a<00:03:08.489> couple<00:03:08.790> of<00:03:08.909> handheld

00:03:09.319 --> 00:03:09.329 
last year we had a couple of handheld

00:03:09.329 --> 00:03:11.360 
last year we had a couple of handheld
scanners<00:03:09.780> similarly<00:03:10.590> and<00:03:10.949> they<00:03:11.069> worked<00:03:11.219> out

00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:11.370 
scanners similarly and they worked out

00:03:11.370 --> 00:03:12.949 
scanners similarly and they worked out
well<00:03:11.609> for<00:03:11.639> us<00:03:11.969> but<00:03:12.299> what<00:03:12.480> we've<00:03:12.599> done<00:03:12.780> this

00:03:12.949 --> 00:03:12.959 
well for us but what we've done this

00:03:12.959 --> 00:03:15.259 
well for us but what we've done this
year<00:03:13.259> is<00:03:13.290> basically<00:03:14.220> taking<00:03:14.639> the<00:03:14.699> dashboard

00:03:15.259 --> 00:03:15.269 
year is basically taking the dashboard

00:03:15.269 --> 00:03:19.969 
year is basically taking the dashboard
out<00:03:15.449> and<00:03:15.870> put<00:03:16.439> into<00:03:17.000> Bearcat<00:03:18.000> 996<00:03:18.840> gps-enabled

00:03:19.969 --> 00:03:19.979 
out and put into Bearcat 996 gps-enabled

00:03:19.979 --> 00:03:22.670 
out and put into Bearcat 996 gps-enabled
trumping<00:03:20.519> scanners<00:03:21.470> basically<00:03:22.470> what<00:03:22.590> I'm

00:03:22.670 --> 00:03:22.680 
trumping scanners basically what I'm

00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:25.330 
trumping scanners basically what I'm
doing<00:03:22.889> right<00:03:23.040> now<00:03:23.099> is<00:03:23.250> loading<00:03:24.060> all<00:03:24.479> of<00:03:24.900> the

00:03:25.330 --> 00:03:25.340 
doing right now is loading all of the

00:03:25.340 --> 00:03:28.350 
doing right now is loading all of the
GPS<00:03:26.340> coordinates<00:03:26.549> and<00:03:27.000> police<00:03:27.329> channels

00:03:28.350 --> 00:03:28.360 
GPS coordinates and police channels

00:03:28.360 --> 00:03:30.390 
GPS coordinates and police channels
or<00:03:28.570> the<00:03:29.200> northern<00:03:29.530> half<00:03:29.740> of<00:03:29.860> the<00:03:29.920> run<00:03:30.130> in<00:03:30.370> the

00:03:30.390 --> 00:03:30.400 
or the northern half of the run in the

00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:32.010 
or the northern half of the run in the
top<00:03:30.640> scanner<00:03:31.000> and<00:03:31.240> the<00:03:31.330> southern<00:03:31.600> half<00:03:31.780> would

00:03:32.010 --> 00:03:32.020 
top scanner and the southern half would

00:03:32.020 --> 00:03:34.200 
top scanner and the southern half would
run<00:03:32.170> in<00:03:32.380> the<00:03:32.470> bottom<00:03:32.620> scanner<00:03:33.100> so<00:03:33.790> we<00:03:34.030> don't

00:03:34.200 --> 00:03:34.210 
run in the bottom scanner so we don't

00:03:34.210 --> 00:03:35.490 
run in the bottom scanner so we don't
even<00:03:34.390> have<00:03:34.570> to<00:03:34.810> worry<00:03:35.020> about<00:03:35.110> what

00:03:35.490 --> 00:03:35.500 
even have to worry about what

00:03:35.500 --> 00:03:36.930 
even have to worry about what
municipality<00:03:36.310> what<00:03:36.460> state<00:03:36.730> were<00:03:36.880> in

00:03:36.930 --> 00:03:36.940 
municipality what state were in

00:03:36.940 --> 00:03:39.870 
municipality what state were in
automatically<00:03:37.810> these<00:03:37.960> things<00:03:38.250> do<00:03:39.250> to<00:03:39.370> the<00:03:39.460> GPS

00:03:39.870 --> 00:03:39.880 
automatically these things do to the GPS

00:03:39.880 --> 00:03:43.710 
automatically these things do to the GPS
enabling<00:03:40.420> will<00:03:40.990> pick<00:03:41.860> up<00:03:42.010> on<00:03:42.190> whatever<00:03:42.720> police

00:03:43.710 --> 00:03:43.720 
enabling will pick up on whatever police

00:03:43.720 --> 00:03:53.010 
enabling will pick up on whatever police
frequencies<00:03:44.320> are<00:03:44.680> in<00:03:44.920> that<00:03:45.070> area<00:03:51.180> and<00:03:52.180> we<00:03:52.810> got

00:03:53.010 --> 00:03:53.020 
frequencies are in that area and we got

00:03:53.020 --> 00:03:55.320 
frequencies are in that area and we got
here<00:03:53.320> and<00:03:53.710> the<00:03:54.070> brake<00:03:54.310> light<00:03:54.550> was<00:03:54.820> on

00:03:55.320 --> 00:03:55.330 
here and the brake light was on

00:03:55.330 --> 00:03:58.110 
here and the brake light was on
and<00:03:55.420> so<00:03:55.690> my<00:03:56.290> husband<00:03:56.650> called<00:03:56.970> Lamborghini<00:03:57.970> of

00:03:58.110 --> 00:03:58.120 
and so my husband called Lamborghini of

00:03:58.120 --> 00:03:59.850 
and so my husband called Lamborghini of
Montreal<00:03:58.660> and<00:03:59.020> they<00:03:59.110> said<00:03:59.320> to<00:03:59.350> bring<00:03:59.560> it<00:03:59.710> in

00:03:59.850 --> 00:03:59.860 
Montreal and they said to bring it in

00:03:59.860 --> 00:04:01.580 
Montreal and they said to bring it in
and<00:04:00.160> it<00:04:00.310> would<00:04:00.400> pop<00:04:00.610> off<00:04:00.670> the<00:04:01.000> brake<00:04:01.180> fluid

00:04:01.580 --> 00:04:01.590 
and it would pop off the brake fluid

00:04:01.590 --> 00:04:03.390 
and it would pop off the brake fluid
because<00:04:02.590> they<00:04:02.680> thought<00:04:02.830> it<00:04:02.980> was<00:04:03.100> a<00:04:03.130> great

00:04:03.390 --> 00:04:03.400 
because they thought it was a great

00:04:03.400 --> 00:04:06.300 
because they thought it was a great
fluid<00:04:03.820> issue<00:04:03.970> so<00:04:04.620> he<00:04:05.620> dropped<00:04:05.860> me<00:04:05.950> off<00:04:05.980> at<00:04:06.220> the

00:04:06.300 --> 00:04:06.310 
fluid issue so he dropped me off at the

00:04:06.310 --> 00:04:09.900 
fluid issue so he dropped me off at the
hotel<00:04:06.430> he<00:04:07.390> drove<00:04:07.660> I<00:04:08.050> don't<00:04:08.740> know<00:04:08.830> six<00:04:09.310> or<00:04:09.580> seven

00:04:09.900 --> 00:04:09.910 
hotel he drove I don't know six or seven

00:04:09.910 --> 00:04:12.960 
hotel he drove I don't know six or seven
city<00:04:10.240> blocks<00:04:10.560> and<00:04:11.560> the<00:04:11.770> clutch<00:04:12.010> went<00:04:12.280> out<00:04:12.400> and

00:04:12.960 --> 00:04:12.970 
city blocks and the clutch went out and

00:04:12.970 --> 00:04:15.540 
city blocks and the clutch went out and
the<00:04:13.810> really<00:04:14.410> bad<00:04:14.590> part<00:04:14.830> of<00:04:14.980> that<00:04:15.130> is<00:04:15.310> is<00:04:15.520> that

00:04:15.540 --> 00:04:15.550 
the really bad part of that is is that

00:04:15.550 --> 00:04:17.340 
the really bad part of that is is that
we<00:04:15.850> just<00:04:16.030> put<00:04:16.330> in<00:04:16.420> a<00:04:16.480> new<00:04:16.600> clutch<00:04:16.840> before<00:04:17.260> we

00:04:17.340 --> 00:04:17.350 
we just put in a new clutch before we

00:04:17.350 --> 00:04:19.979 
we just put in a new clutch before we
came<00:04:17.530> so<00:04:18.130> I<00:04:18.160> think<00:04:18.340> that<00:04:18.640> once<00:04:19.480> that<00:04:19.720> went<00:04:19.930> out

00:04:19.979 --> 00:04:19.989 
came so I think that once that went out

00:04:19.989 --> 00:04:22.530 
came so I think that once that went out
has<00:04:20.230> all<00:04:20.440> of<00:04:21.300> it

00:04:22.530 --> 00:04:22.540 
has all of it

00:04:22.540 --> 00:04:24.690 
has all of it
that's<00:04:23.290> right<00:04:23.500> that<00:04:23.740> happens<00:04:23.950> when<00:04:24.400> you<00:04:24.520> buy

00:04:24.690 --> 00:04:24.700 
that's right that happens when you buy

00:04:24.700 --> 00:04:25.740 
that's right that happens when you buy
the<00:04:24.760> wrong<00:04:24.970> car

00:04:25.740 --> 00:04:25.750 
the wrong car

00:04:25.750 --> 00:04:28.710 
the wrong car
it's<00:04:26.530> a<00:04:26.650> very<00:04:26.860> very<00:04:27.100> nice<00:04:27.370> car<00:04:27.730> but<00:04:28.390> it<00:04:28.510> should

00:04:28.710 --> 00:04:28.720 
it's a very very nice car but it should

00:04:28.720 --> 00:04:30.900 
it's a very very nice car but it should
run<00:04:28.930> that's<00:04:29.380> the<00:04:29.590> most<00:04:29.800> important<00:04:30.400> thing<00:04:30.430> and

00:04:30.900 --> 00:04:30.910 
run that's the most important thing and

00:04:30.910 --> 00:04:33.150 
run that's the most important thing and
now<00:04:31.480> we<00:04:31.540> start<00:04:32.020> developing<00:04:32.260> Italy<00:04:33.010> or

00:04:33.150 --> 00:04:33.160 
now we start developing Italy or

00:04:33.160 --> 00:04:42.210 
now we start developing Italy or
predicted<00:04:33.820> to<00:04:34.660> get<00:04:35.140> it<00:04:35.260> back<00:04:41.040> before<00:04:42.040> the

00:04:42.210 --> 00:04:42.220 
predicted to get it back before the

00:04:42.220 --> 00:04:44.159 
predicted to get it back before the
start<00:04:42.580> of<00:04:42.730> the<00:04:42.850> rally<00:04:43.000> no<00:04:43.540> we're<00:04:43.900> excited

00:04:44.159 --> 00:04:44.169 
start of the rally no we're excited

00:04:44.169 --> 00:04:46.860 
start of the rally no we're excited
about<00:04:44.260> the<00:04:44.470> rally<00:04:44.680> I<00:04:44.800> think<00:04:45.070> I<00:04:45.750> think<00:04:46.750> I'm

00:04:46.860 --> 00:04:46.870 
about the rally I think I think I'm

00:04:46.870 --> 00:04:48.540 
about the rally I think I think I'm
ready<00:04:47.020> I'm<00:04:47.290> gonna<00:04:47.380> drop<00:04:47.620> a<00:04:47.680> coily<00:04:48.430> on

00:04:48.540 --> 00:04:48.550 
ready I'm gonna drop a coily on

00:04:48.550 --> 00:04:50.040
