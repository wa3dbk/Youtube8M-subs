00:00:05.960 --> 00:00:13.610
 isolated dumbbell lifting for biceps 

00:00:09.800 --> 00:00:16.650
 ways to run mnu 

00:00:13.610 --> 00:00:18.750
 but all sorts of concentrated there 

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:21.960
 a lot of biceps flexing 

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:24.140
 let's go his biceps but we will consider 

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:26.999
 climb on larry scott bench 

00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:31.589
 with a toe I larry scott she's not mine 

00:00:26.999 --> 00:00:36.840
 there is no such bench why but she doesn't 

00:00:31.589 --> 00:00:43.500
 arranges there a little slope that is 

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:46.850
 there, well, and I do this and that 

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:48.600
 planet but negative fee therefore 

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:51.890
 he is so inclined 

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:54.930
 I perform here with a barbell and dumbbells 

00:00:51.890 --> 00:00:59.940
 here is more isolated getting a father 

00:00:54.930 --> 00:01:02.190
 technician movement there amplitude 

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:02.700
 lifting which provides the load on 

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:08.969
 biceps 

00:01:02.700 --> 00:01:12.979
 along the entire trajectory of movement she 

00:01:08.969 --> 00:01:12.979
 performs take ride 

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:21.760
 inhale exhale inhale exhale 

00:01:19.030 --> 00:01:24.030
 itâ€™s better to keep it like this 

00:01:21.760 --> 00:01:24.030
 by the corner 

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:31.710
 can be performed alternately 

00:01:39.130 --> 00:01:41.460
 to 

00:01:41.570 --> 00:01:47.270
 but if you have no such board 

00:01:45.140 --> 00:01:53.510
 be upset you can use 

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:59.229
 I use the usual board alternately 

00:01:53.510 --> 00:02:03.050
 Here is a board that I use and 

00:01:59.229 --> 00:02:06.320
 while the role of exercise, even when 

00:02:03.050 --> 00:02:10.039
 exercises on the shoulders and exercises 

00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:14.510
 on the press one end of it stands there for 

00:02:10.039 --> 00:02:18.170
 shop under the support that do not give here 

00:02:14.510 --> 00:02:19.130
 so roll over set the board 

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:22.160
 at the right angle 

00:02:19.130 --> 00:02:29.110
 angle can be adjusted by substituting the bench 

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:33.140
 take a dumbbell in your hand 

00:02:29.110 --> 00:02:38.200
 we put it this way so that the whole hand 

00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:43.780
 plane triceps lay on the board 

00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:50.480
 put your hand on the inhale lower your hand back 

00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:52.000
 before touching the disc board and exhale 

00:02:50.480 --> 00:02:56.260
 raise 

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:58.760
 the hand rises to such a position 

00:02:56.260 --> 00:03:02.480
 above raise just not worth it because 

00:02:58.760 --> 00:03:05.410
 that the load is lost still you might think 

00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:09.950
 when using large scales 

00:03:05.410 --> 00:03:11.989
 but it is done to give hands 

00:03:09.950 --> 00:03:14.060
 a little rest, that is, the hand is resting 

00:03:11.989 --> 00:03:17.230
 and lower phase upper it allows 

00:03:14.060 --> 00:03:20.180
 use large and like 

00:03:17.230 --> 00:03:23.200
 don't rush it is used by experienced athletes 

00:03:20.180 --> 00:03:25.850
 which I know how to handle it 

00:03:23.200 --> 00:03:30.110
 then one more if you feel that 

00:03:25.850 --> 00:03:33.440
 when doing the exercise board David 

00:03:30.110 --> 00:03:37.250
 you elbow it means vizant or taken 

00:03:33.440 --> 00:03:38.930
 too great i mean you bezant or 

00:03:37.250 --> 00:03:42.650
 turns back there you are not able 

00:03:38.930 --> 00:03:47.170
 handle her therefore 

00:03:42.650 --> 00:03:50.060
 the hand on holds on 3 all lies there and 

00:03:47.170 --> 00:03:56.959
 performing an exercise but does not deliver 

00:03:50.060 --> 00:04:02.470
 some discomfort inhale exhale inhale 

00:03:56.959 --> 00:04:02.470
 exhale inhale exhale 

00:04:02.890 --> 00:04:10.489
 there is another nuance of turning away the elbow 

00:04:07.099 --> 00:04:14.510
 hand works this yoruba show here in 

00:04:10.489 --> 00:04:18.289
 this mode, that is, the hand is not on 

00:04:14.510 --> 00:04:20.329
 triceps and a little support makes 

00:04:18.289 --> 00:04:23.330
 from there it is also wrong it is 

00:04:20.329 --> 00:04:28.310
 a blunder it also shows 

00:04:23.330 --> 00:04:31.580
 about using the weight with which you 

00:04:28.310 --> 00:04:32.949
 handle can't hand must stand 

00:04:31.580 --> 00:04:42.889
 so more or less horn 

00:04:32.949 --> 00:04:46.520
 inhale exhale exhale performed 

00:04:42.889 --> 00:04:49.340
 a certain number of repetitions pause 

00:04:46.520 --> 00:04:50.979
 for recreation is usually not done changing 

00:04:49.340 --> 00:04:56.020
 arm 

00:04:50.979 --> 00:04:56.020
 performed with the other hand 

00:04:59.639 --> 00:05:09.210
 then also gas pause is performed 

00:05:03.910 --> 00:05:11.889
 back 1 hand and gas pause for rest 2 

00:05:09.210 --> 00:05:16.389
 performing an exercise on the board even in 

00:05:11.889 --> 00:05:21.970
 somewhat better as it allows in 

00:05:16.389 --> 00:05:24.000
 more isolate the biceps and change 

00:05:21.970 --> 00:05:26.500
 change different styling 

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:32.800
 board here it should rest on 

00:05:26.500 --> 00:05:35.250
 the armpit lies down the hotel to perform very 

00:05:32.800 --> 00:05:35.250
 conveniently
