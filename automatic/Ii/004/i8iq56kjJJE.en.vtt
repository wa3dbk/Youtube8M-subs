00:00:00.579 --> 00:00:11.330
 so hello i'm going to get busted by now 

00:00:08.049 --> 00:00:15.200
 replace the electric lock 

00:00:11.330 --> 00:00:16.580
 electrical part so on the 11th 

00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:21.039
 Elster we have everything behind 

00:00:16.580 --> 00:00:29.240
 then unscrew all the plugs 

00:00:21.039 --> 00:00:33.340
 Out all the keys must always be stuck 

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:37.250
 stay that lock me locked 

00:00:33.340 --> 00:00:43.309
 then we'll write two down here 

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:48.829
 unscrew and slowly pull albert 

00:00:43.309 --> 00:00:53.000
 cook slowly so here there are such 

00:00:48.829 --> 00:00:53.809
 small cable so we do not need that 

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:56.660
 do 

00:00:53.809 --> 00:00:58.789
 we just go with the steering wheel here 

00:00:56.660 --> 00:01:03.400
 the climbing wall 

00:00:58.789 --> 00:01:10.090
 because and screw this middle mother 

00:01:03.400 --> 00:01:10.090
 get out and see the steering wheel 

00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:23.620
 then we make a bug again on the 

00:01:17.930 --> 00:01:23.620
 right place slowly like that 

00:01:32.740 --> 00:01:50.590
 Now look here, the three screwdrivers 

00:01:40.159 --> 00:01:56.090
 go and pull this one underneath 

00:01:50.590 --> 00:01:58.329
 so this just needs to be screwed 

00:01:56.090 --> 00:01:58.329
 stay here 

00:02:01.750 --> 00:02:07.610
 then I built one myself here 

00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:13.660
 you are here 

00:02:07.610 --> 00:02:18.410
 pull out this steering wheel part underneath 

00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:23.180
 I tightened this purely 

00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:24.349
 and then with such action I had that 

00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:29.959
 pulled down 

00:02:24.349 --> 00:02:32.470
 that just applies then so closed 

00:02:29.959 --> 00:02:32.470
 pulled out 

00:02:32.620 --> 00:02:43.790
 this electrical part replaced so 

00:02:38.530 --> 00:02:46.579
 he was really broken then again 

00:02:43.790 --> 00:02:51.579
 final printed this part again 

00:02:46.579 --> 00:02:58.359
 back with a bit of this part 

00:02:51.579 --> 00:03:03.319
 pulled down the final round 

00:02:58.359 --> 00:03:09.650
 electrical part exchanged so then 

00:03:03.319 --> 00:03:16.220
 again this steering wheel part again 

00:03:09.650 --> 00:03:18.319
 bit with the hammer place only with 1 

00:03:16.220 --> 00:03:23.169
 beaten and then with mother 

00:03:18.319 --> 00:03:26.750
 moved on so now we can again 

00:03:23.169 --> 00:03:29.720
 Everything as we mined on so carefully 

00:03:26.750 --> 00:03:34.850
 to do everything well 

00:03:29.720 --> 00:03:38.040
 So we'll share this five blinkers 

00:03:34.850 --> 00:03:40.819
 we turn everything back again 

00:03:38.040 --> 00:03:40.819
 firmly 

00:03:55.420 --> 00:03:59.350
 that everything is right 

00:04:11.490 --> 00:04:17.370
 then we plug in all the plugs again 

00:04:13.410 --> 00:04:20.100
 Do not confuse it purely with her 

00:04:17.370 --> 00:04:25.020
 This is supposed to make everyone fit 

00:04:20.100 --> 00:04:31.520
 in his place then we have again 

00:04:25.020 --> 00:04:31.520
 steering wheel we do the same again 

00:04:38.810 --> 00:04:45.200
 we have a seat and then wheels 

00:04:42.510 --> 00:04:51.440
 just tell her that you are her 

00:04:45.200 --> 00:04:51.440
 steering wheel right in the middle exactly the 1 

00:04:52.970 --> 00:05:00.000
 and as mother tighten again alba 

00:04:56.370 --> 00:05:03.300
 cryan this mother again fix this 

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:06.300
 wrap everything back in and out 

00:05:03.300 --> 00:05:12.390
 that 's it, that's how it works when you are 

00:05:06.300 --> 00:05:15.110
 just ask to enroll or mine 

00:05:12.390 --> 00:05:15.110
