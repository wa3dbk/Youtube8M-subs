00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:32.060
 by cube 

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:32.060
 by under the intertwining sciences of science 

00:00:45.739 --> 00:00:51.120
 Hello dear friends with you, Sergei

 andreas 

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:56.010
 Well, the garage began us quietly 

00:00:53.969 --> 00:00:58.230
 flourish because mister friends 

00:00:56.010 --> 00:01:00.270
 the truth is engaged in its design can 

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:01.829
 so say well and our sister kendall 

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:04.019

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:07.020
 car repair center that is, we have san fierro 

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:08.820
 It will be the first company but more on that a little 

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:11.310
 later now on a completely different 

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:13.080
 job from officer tenpenny he us 

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:14.640
 called and said to substitute one 

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:16.590
 a person who is trying something 

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:19.049
 I figure out his dark intentions 

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:22.170
 and this very person district attorney 

00:01:19.049 --> 00:01:24.479
 so we will not pity him the prosecutor 

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:26.909
 it becomes on time at the banks hotel 

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:28.979
 where we dressing up as a footman or 

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:31.890
 differently valet and steal it 

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:34.259
 typewriter, too, at the time we will drive off on it in 

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:36.659
 our garage and we are weaving marijuana mr 

00:01:34.259 --> 00:01:39.119
 truth but first we need faster 

00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:41.670
 that the prosecutor herself drive to the hotel what 

00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:42.630
 we have already done and yet us in this very 

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:44.759
 the hotel will need 

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:46.320
 get clothes valet 

00:01:44.759 --> 00:01:47.880
 so some of these clothes will not give us 

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:50.549
 so we take it from the other 

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:52.229
 valet with power and just our victim 

00:01:50.549 --> 00:01:53.009
 Now it is going to put a miracle car on 

00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:54.899
 parking lot 

00:01:53.009 --> 00:01:57.299
 we shall follow this same lackey 

00:01:54.899 --> 00:01:59.100
 proceed and score to death on and 

00:01:57.299 --> 00:02:00.450
 by the way when are you this valet a 

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:02.429
 kick it and stumble it up to that point 

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:05.250
 until he escapes the light of day that is 

00:02:02.429 --> 00:02:06.780
 and parking outside and by the way if he 

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:08.459
 run out to parking in the street I don't know 

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:10.170
 will not experimented new 

00:02:08.459 --> 00:02:11.819
 check her write in the comments 

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:14.190
 mission will fail or not or all 

00:02:11.819 --> 00:02:15.989
 such a similar way this is the lackey 

00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:17.610
 doesn't react to our blows 

00:02:15.989 --> 00:02:19.590
 in general, the most important thing to him 

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:21.299
 park cars back in place and 

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:23.610
 wait for another customer 

00:02:21.299 --> 00:02:26.220
 so take advantage of the moment we kill 

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:29.370
 him we leave him in his shorts and yes 

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:31.709
 pick up clothes by the way 

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:33.470
 footman uniform on his clothes to 

00:02:31.709 --> 00:02:36.690
 change did not have then to 

00:02:33.470 --> 00:02:39.329
 and manage to do some dirty clothes 

00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:41.670
 the course of the Carl trampled 

00:02:39.329 --> 00:02:42.480
 lackey and of course she will be dirty but 

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:45.090
 how else 

00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:47.280
 Well, here we are in the parking lot now 

00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:48.930
 we have to wait for the prosecutor us 

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:51.060
 here they write so we do not confuse him with 

00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:53.010
 another car and but one of the lackeys us 

00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:55.709
 will say what type this district attorney is he 

00:02:53.010 --> 00:02:58.019
 pays good tips and things like that 

00:02:55.709 --> 00:02:59.639
 so you do not confuse him with anyone though 

00:02:58.019 --> 00:03:01.620
 if you missed this dialogue or you 

00:02:59.639 --> 00:03:03.600
 there is no version, but you need to fill 

00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:05.790
 car and narrow prosecutor 

00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:07.380
 By the way, there are a lot of these skins. 

00:03:05.790 --> 00:03:07.950
 Well, that is, the prosecutor, so you can 

00:03:07.380 --> 00:03:10.709
 confused 

00:03:07.950 --> 00:03:12.329
 but most importantly remember the car by the way 

00:03:10.709 --> 00:03:14.489
 here is such a funny picture I was 

00:03:12.329 --> 00:03:16.709
 always meadows and jester while doing so 

00:03:14.489 --> 00:03:20.190
 here's a map thread under the shaft ok call carl 

00:03:16.709 --> 00:03:22.470
 it's okay by the way, we replace it 

00:03:20.190 --> 00:03:24.780
 let's say skin 3 lackeys 

00:03:22.470 --> 00:03:26.269
 a variety of some made by the way here 

00:03:24.780 --> 00:03:28.920
 just the skin of the prosecutor 

00:03:26.269 --> 00:03:31.109
 but the car is different so it's not real 

00:03:28.920 --> 00:03:33.720
 we need to wait for the present and just 

00:03:31.109 --> 00:03:36.000
 real present drove it out like 

00:03:33.720 --> 00:03:39.030
 once at the traffic lights I think you 

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:40.040
 see when he will drive you all you 

00:03:39.030 --> 00:03:42.660
 will see 

00:03:40.040 --> 00:03:45.329
 that way when he arrives we need faster 

00:03:42.660 --> 00:03:47.280
 here is this goose get in his car and then 

00:03:45.329 --> 00:03:49.260
 the mission will fail though I don't know 

00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:50.759
 will she check whether it is not right 

00:03:49.260 --> 00:03:51.470
 checked all the time sat in the right 

00:03:50.759 --> 00:03:53.690
 the car 

00:03:51.470 --> 00:03:55.370
 here's a dialogue like this is a district 

00:03:53.690 --> 00:03:57.890
 the prosecutor generously gives good tips 

00:03:55.370 --> 00:04:00.800
 so we do not pick up the machine 

00:03:57.890 --> 00:04:02.780
 the prosecutor is driving our garage and I don't understand 

00:04:00.800 --> 00:04:04.700
 how to this very lucky who himself stood 

00:04:02.780 --> 00:04:08.240
 and the prosecutor did not see that we were going not 

00:04:04.700 --> 00:04:10.040
 parking in far away and by the way us 

00:04:08.240 --> 00:04:12.530
 there was a time indicator that is there 

00:04:10.040 --> 00:04:14.720
 during this time you need to have time to nashpigovat 

00:04:12.530 --> 00:04:15.920
 yourself a machine marijuana mr 

00:04:14.720 --> 00:04:18.019
 return her to the parking lot 

00:04:15.920 --> 00:04:20.120
 time is pretty short we can 

00:04:18.019 --> 00:04:21.490
 and not have time on and by the way when you already 

00:04:20.120 --> 00:04:24.290
 found haiti car 

00:04:21.490 --> 00:04:25.820
 marijuana then it will be necessary not to crash nor 

00:04:24.290 --> 00:04:27.710
 in whom from coal to live it will be necessary 

00:04:25.820 --> 00:04:29.270
 go back to the garage and time 

00:04:27.710 --> 00:04:32.030
 so we need to do everything 

00:04:29.270 --> 00:04:35.890
 more careful you too quickly all is necessary 

00:04:32.030 --> 00:04:35.890
 do so be careful 

00:04:42.840 --> 00:04:47.370
 well, everything is ready for setup now 

00:04:45.360 --> 00:04:49.680
 we need to return the car to the parking lot without 

00:04:47.370 --> 00:04:52.199
 a single scratch and there everything will be 

00:04:49.680 --> 00:04:54.330
 see what happens to the prosecutor yes I don't 

00:04:52.199 --> 00:04:56.190
 I know it may not seem so or when we 

00:04:54.330 --> 00:04:58.500
 write can not be scratched or something as like 

00:04:56.190 --> 00:05:00.990
 In addition, all the machines did so that we 

00:04:58.500 --> 00:05:02.460
 bump and we failed the mission by the way 

00:05:00.990 --> 00:05:03.990
 we have less time left 

00:05:02.460 --> 00:05:06.479
 less so hurry so much and and 

00:05:03.990 --> 00:05:08.400
 cautious were well here you see they 

00:05:06.479 --> 00:05:10.199
 will take special try at us 

00:05:08.400 --> 00:05:12.990
 crashes so that we say let's go 

00:05:10.199 --> 00:05:17.510
 the reverse mustard and not paint spray but in 

00:05:12.990 --> 00:05:17.510
 the garage that's why I'm careful 

00:05:58.699 --> 00:06:05.659
 low without quit and 

00:06:00.839 --> 00:06:05.659
 and the son of Alice himself arrogant looking for Kolchak 

00:06:30.679 --> 00:06:33.679
 fortify 

00:06:40.440 --> 00:06:44.480
 but
