00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:49.550 
you listen to a song you can kind of
slide<00:01:48.210> ahead<00:01:48.780> to<00:01:48.960> see<00:01:49.140> what<00:01:49.170> he's<00:01:49.409> actually

00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:49.560 
slide ahead to see what he's actually

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:50.899 
slide ahead to see what he's actually
coming<00:01:49.799> up<00:01:49.950> next<00:01:50.189> but<00:01:50.430> this<00:01:50.549> doesn't<00:01:50.850> change

00:01:50.899 --> 00:01:50.909 
coming up next but this doesn't change

00:01:50.909 --> 00:01:53.630 
coming up next but this doesn't change
the<00:01:51.299> track<00:01:51.680> until<00:01:52.680> you<00:01:52.770> fully<00:01:52.950> slide<00:01:53.340> across
