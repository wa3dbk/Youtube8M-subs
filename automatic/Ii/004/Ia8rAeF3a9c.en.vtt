00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:45.570 
this case here in the violin we have

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:51.170 
this case here in the violin we have
basically<00:00:46.670> the<00:00:47.670> harmonic<00:00:48.149> box<00:00:49.820> the<00:00:50.820> harmonic

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:51.180 
basically the harmonic box the harmonic

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:55.400 
basically the harmonic box the harmonic
box<00:00:51.420> is<00:00:51.600> made<00:00:51.780> of<00:00:52.050> atop<00:00:52.980> a<00:00:53.219> sound<00:00:53.850> hub<00:00:54.230> here<00:00:55.230> on

00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:55.410 
box is made of atop a sound hub here on

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:57.860 
box is made of atop a sound hub here on
the<00:00:55.530> side<00:00:55.770> we<00:00:56.010> have<00:00:56.039> the<00:00:56.250> bouts<00:00:56.870> sometimes

00:00:57.860 --> 00:00:57.870 
the side we have the bouts sometimes

00:00:57.870 --> 00:00:59.420 
the side we have the bouts sometimes
they're<00:00:58.050> also<00:00:58.199> called<00:00:58.530> sides<00:00:58.890> and<00:00:59.219> we<00:00:59.309> have

00:00:59.420 --> 00:00:59.430 
they're also called sides and we have

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:04.719 
they're also called sides and we have
three<00:00:59.670> parts<00:01:00.059> on<00:01:00.329> each<00:01:00.480> side<00:01:00.809> so<00:01:01.590> 3<00:01:02.059> 4<00:01:03.059> 5<00:01:03.629> 6<00:01:04.019> and

00:01:04.719 --> 00:01:04.729 
three parts on each side so 3 4 5 6 and

00:01:04.729 --> 00:01:07.190 
three parts on each side so 3 4 5 6 and
then<00:01:05.729> we<00:01:06.150> have<00:01:06.390> the<00:01:06.630> bottom<00:01:06.930> of<00:01:07.080> the

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:07.200 
then we have the bottom of the

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:10.789 
then we have the bottom of the
instrument<00:01:07.710> and<00:01:08.360> these<00:01:09.360> three<00:01:09.689> aspects<00:01:10.229> they

00:01:10.789 --> 00:01:10.799 
instrument and these three aspects they

00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:14.450 
instrument and these three aspects they
conform<00:01:11.430> together<00:01:11.880> the<00:01:12.450> acoustic<00:01:13.460> the

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:14.460 
conform together the acoustic the

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:17.480 
conform together the acoustic the
acoustic<00:01:14.850> box<00:01:15.060> the<00:01:15.930> acoustic<00:01:16.380> box<00:01:16.680> is<00:01:17.070> being

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:17.490 
acoustic box the acoustic box is being

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:20.060 
acoustic box the acoustic box is being
joined<00:01:17.820> together<00:01:18.030> with<00:01:18.750> this<00:01:18.930> part<00:01:19.290> which<00:01:20.040> is

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:20.070 
joined together with this part which is

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:23.120 
joined together with this part which is
known<00:01:20.430> as<00:01:20.729> the<00:01:21.150> neck<00:01:21.390> of<00:01:21.659> the<00:01:21.720> instrument<00:01:22.650> the

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:23.130 
known as the neck of the instrument the

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:24.530 
known as the neck of the instrument the
neck<00:01:23.310> is<00:01:23.340> very<00:01:23.640> important<00:01:24.060> because<00:01:24.150> this<00:01:24.420> is

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:24.540 
neck is very important because this is

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:26.090 
neck is very important because this is
where<00:01:24.720> we<00:01:24.840> hold<00:01:25.080> it<00:01:25.290> with<00:01:25.439> our<00:01:25.590> left<00:01:25.770> hand

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:26.100 
where we hold it with our left hand

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:28.700 
where we hold it with our left hand
where<00:01:26.909> we<00:01:27.210> find<00:01:27.479> the<00:01:27.689> balance<00:01:27.840> and<00:01:28.229> where<00:01:28.530> the

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:28.710 
where we find the balance and where the

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:31.039 
where we find the balance and where the
fingers<00:01:29.100> are<00:01:29.250> placed<00:01:29.549> in<00:01:29.880> order<00:01:30.540> to<00:01:30.780> make

00:01:31.039 --> 00:01:31.049 
fingers are placed in order to make

00:01:31.049 --> 00:01:33.200 
fingers are placed in order to make
create<00:01:31.799> the<00:01:31.979> different<00:01:32.340> sounds<00:01:32.490> we<00:01:32.850> have<00:01:33.000> on

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:33.210 
create the different sounds we have on

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:35.569 
create the different sounds we have on
the<00:01:33.329> violin<00:01:33.659> so<00:01:34.409> the<00:01:34.619> neck<00:01:34.829> would<00:01:35.040> strictly<00:01:35.400> be

00:01:35.569 --> 00:01:35.579 
the violin so the neck would strictly be

00:01:35.579 --> 00:01:38.600 
the violin so the neck would strictly be
starting<00:01:36.270> from<00:01:36.420> here<00:01:36.869> all<00:01:37.259> the<00:01:37.320> way<00:01:37.650> it<00:01:38.100> goes

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:38.610 
starting from here all the way it goes

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:41.899 
starting from here all the way it goes
up<00:01:38.850> it<00:01:39.030> continues<00:01:39.659> here<00:01:39.689> and<00:01:40.310> the<00:01:41.310> neck<00:01:41.490> itself

00:01:41.899 --> 00:01:41.909 
up it continues here and the neck itself

00:01:41.909 --> 00:01:45.560 
up it continues here and the neck itself
is<00:01:42.540> being<00:01:43.009> divided<00:01:44.009> in<00:01:44.220> several<00:01:44.430> aspects<00:01:45.030> we

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:45.570 
is being divided in several aspects we

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:48.050 
is being divided in several aspects we
could<00:01:45.780> call<00:01:46.020> this<00:01:46.229> part<00:01:46.530> here<00:01:46.829> the<00:01:47.009> heel<00:01:47.340> just

00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:48.060 
could call this part here the heel just

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:50.840 
could call this part here the heel just
like<00:01:48.210> a<00:01:48.240> heel<00:01:48.570> on<00:01:48.720> the<00:01:48.810> foot<00:01:49.369> then<00:01:50.369> this<00:01:50.549> is<00:01:50.700> the

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:50.850 
like a heel on the foot then this is the

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:56.510 
like a heel on the foot then this is the
actual<00:01:51.030> neck<00:01:51.450> itself<00:01:51.869> and<00:01:52.939> here<00:01:55.250> the<00:01:56.250> peg<00:01:56.490> box

00:01:56.510 --> 00:01:56.520 
actual neck itself and here the peg box

00:01:56.520 --> 00:01:59.990 
actual neck itself and here the peg box
starts<00:01:57.590> pack<00:01:58.590> box<00:01:58.829> is<00:01:59.040> the<00:01:59.189> area<00:01:59.369> where<00:01:59.729> all

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:00.000 
starts pack box is the area where all

starts pack box is the area where all
the<00:02:00.390> four<00:02:00.689> pegs<00:02:01.079> in<00:02:01.320> the<00:02:01.350> violin<00:02:01.710> are<00:02:01.829> received

00:02:02.209 --> 00:02:02.219 
the four pegs in the violin are received

00:02:02.219 --> 00:02:05.510 
the four pegs in the violin are received
and<00:02:02.659> is<00:02:03.659> being<00:02:03.899> finished<00:02:04.320> finally<00:02:04.890> by<00:02:05.189> this
