00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:47.720 
to kind of like sort my channel out i've
got<00:00:46.170> so<00:00:46.500> many<00:00:46.620> like<00:00:46.890> different<00:00:47.399> ranges<00:00:47.670> of

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:47.730 
got so many like different ranges of

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:49.639 
got so many like different ranges of
subs<00:00:48.120> and<00:00:48.239> i<00:00:48.300> just<00:00:48.480> tried<00:00:48.629> to<00:00:48.899> and<00:00:49.320> it's<00:00:49.469> try

00:00:49.639 --> 00:00:49.649 
subs and i just tried to and it's try

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:51.709 
subs and i just tried to and it's try
make<00:00:49.829> the<00:00:49.920> most<00:00:50.100> of<00:00:50.250> them<00:00:50.399> active<00:00:50.730> as<00:00:51.300> much<00:00:51.539> as

00:00:51.709 --> 00:00:51.719 
make the most of them active as much as

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:53.569 
make the most of them active as much as
possible<00:00:51.870> and<00:00:52.379> i<00:00:52.500> figured<00:00:52.980> this<00:00:53.129> is<00:00:53.250> kind<00:00:53.489> of

00:00:53.569 --> 00:00:53.579 
possible and i figured this is kind of

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:56.150 
possible and i figured this is kind of
like<00:00:53.730> the<00:00:53.879> best<00:00:54.059> way<00:00:54.239> to<00:00:54.300> do<00:00:54.600> it<00:00:54.750> so<00:00:55.440> when<00:00:55.649> you

00:00:56.150 --> 00:00:56.160 
like the best way to do it so when you

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:57.770 
like the best way to do it so when you
can<00:00:56.309> see<00:00:56.489> in<00:00:56.760> the<00:00:56.850> video<00:00:56.940> we've<00:00:57.270> just<00:00:57.480> listed

bought him already converted in

00:03:28.019 --> 00:03:30.229 
bought him already converted in
sentiments<00:03:28.709> were<00:03:28.830> less<00:03:29.010> them<00:03:29.160> up<00:03:29.250> for<00:03:29.430> that

00:03:30.229 --> 00:03:30.239 
sentiments were less them up for that

00:03:30.239 --> 00:03:32.210 
sentiments were less them up for that
and<00:03:30.540> then<00:03:30.690> finally<00:03:30.900> one<00:03:31.470> more<00:03:31.680> of<00:03:31.769> these<00:03:31.920> guys

00:03:32.210 --> 00:03:32.220 
and then finally one more of these guys

00:03:32.220 --> 00:03:34.670 
and then finally one more of these guys
and<00:03:32.549> that<00:03:33.299> is<00:03:33.450> one<00:03:33.989> that<00:03:34.140> we<00:03:34.200> bought<00:03:34.350> for<00:03:34.380> five

00:03:34.670 --> 00:03:34.680

00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:35.840 
and that is one that we bought for five
thousand<00:03:35.040> one<00:03:35.130> hundred<00:03:35.160> coins<00:03:35.489> in<00:03:35.730> the

00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:35.850 
thousand one hundred coins in the

00:03:38.330 --> 00:03:38.340 
striker fallen to 12 and I think we

00:03:38.340 --> 00:03:42.199 
striker fallen to 12 and I think we
listen<00:03:38.580> what<00:03:38.670> for<00:03:39.230> 8600<00:03:40.230> just<00:03:40.709> about<00:03:41.130> now<00:03:41.850> yet
