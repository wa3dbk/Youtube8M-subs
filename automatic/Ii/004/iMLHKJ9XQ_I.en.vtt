00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:04.490
 hello everyone welcome to easy cooking 

00:00:02.629 --> 00:00:06.589
 today I'm going to teach you to do 

00:00:04.490 --> 00:00:08.780
 some delicious tamarind balls are 

00:00:06.589 --> 00:00:11.719
 super easy to make and they are also 

00:00:08.780 --> 00:00:14.150
 delicious I hope you like them for 

00:00:11.719 --> 00:00:18.440
 this recipe we need half a kilo of 

00:00:14.150 --> 00:00:20.570
 tamarind half a cup of water a cup of 

00:00:18.440 --> 00:00:23.539
 sugar plus a little extra for 

00:00:20.570 --> 00:00:26.269
 sprinkle one or two tablespoons of 

00:00:23.539 --> 00:00:28.460
 chile powder I'm using chile de 

00:00:26.269 --> 00:00:30.830
 tree but can use any 

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:33.440
 chili that is your favorite and three 

00:00:30.830 --> 00:00:36.900
 Tablespoon of tajine powder the tajine is 

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:39.570
 optional let's start 

00:00:36.900 --> 00:00:42.060
 start by peeling the tamarind the 

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:44.580
 Tamarind shell is hard but 

00:00:42.060 --> 00:00:46.980
 it's very easy to peel just press a 

00:00:44.580 --> 00:00:48.510
 little about the shell and it will break and 

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:51.750
 that remains only removes the 

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:54.450
 Completely also remove the veins 

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:56.730
 to the tamarind the veins are also super 

00:00:54.450 --> 00:00:59.460
 easy to remove but if you like you can 

00:00:56.730 --> 00:01:01.950
 cut them with a knife like that is how 

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:04.440
 they look like the tamarinds already peeled now 

00:01:01.950 --> 00:01:06.840
 you can cook them I prefer to take them 

00:01:04.440 --> 00:01:08.580
 the seeds before cooking them since 

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:10.530
 it's a little bit easier because 

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:12.869
 to cook it the tamarind gets very 

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:15.440
 sticky and difficult to find 

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:18.570
 seeds so with a small knife 

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:20.640
 cut along the tamarind and stir 

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:22.979
 the seeds they have inside do not 

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:24.780
 you have to remove all in fact it's 

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:26.580
 necessary to leave a few seeds 

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:29.040
 to give you a little more 

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:31.200
 tamarind texture if you bought 

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:32.970
 these sweets you will realize that 

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:35.250
 any tamarind candy has 

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:36.990
 seeds in it so do not worry 

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:39.240
 a lot to take away all the seeds 

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:40.980
 you can leave so many seeds in the 

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:43.470
 mix as you like 

00:01:40.980 --> 00:01:46.200
 since you have removed the seeds now 

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:49.680
 in a saucepan over medium heat add the 

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:53.130
 water the sugar two tablespoons of chili 

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:55.680
 powder and a tablespoon of tagine mix 

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:57.830
 well and cook over medium heat until 

00:01:55.680 --> 00:02:00.860
 boil 

00:01:57.830 --> 00:02:03.290
 since the mixture is boiling now 

00:02:00.860 --> 00:02:05.540
 reduce the fire and add the tamarind 

00:02:03.290 --> 00:02:08.660
 Stir a little to make the tamarind 

00:02:05.540 --> 00:02:11.000
 Cover well with the liquid and cook 

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:13.580
 low heat for 20 minutes or until the 

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:16.250
 tamarind has been reduced to a paste 

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:18.560
 with a fork press the tamarind a 

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:20.210
 little so that it is not very whole in 

00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:22.730
 this point the tamarind must already be 

00:02:20.210 --> 00:02:25.490
 completely soft so it will be very 

00:02:22.730 --> 00:02:27.950
 easy to undo it completely if you have 

00:02:25.490 --> 00:02:29.950
 problems when trying to undo it just 

00:02:27.950 --> 00:02:32.590
 let cook for a couple of minutes 

00:02:29.950 --> 00:02:34.820
 since the tamarind is well undone 

00:02:32.590 --> 00:02:37.160
 now let's let it cool 

00:02:34.820 --> 00:02:39.440
 You can completely put it in the 

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:41.780
 refrigerator if you like 

00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:43.790
 since the tamarind is cold now 

00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:46.220
 in a bowl mix two or three tablespoons 

00:02:43.790 --> 00:02:49.540
 of sugar with half a tablespoon of chili 

00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:52.270
 in powder and one or two tablespoons of tajÃ­n 

00:02:49.540 --> 00:02:55.160
 stir well and reserve for a moment 

00:02:52.270 --> 00:02:57.110
 the tamarind paste is very sticky 

00:02:55.160 --> 00:02:59.480
 so to prevent the tamarind from 

00:02:57.110 --> 00:03:02.780
 Stick a lot to your hands smeared with a 

00:02:59.480 --> 00:03:04.760
 little vegetable oil and now it starts to 

00:03:02.780 --> 00:03:06.350
 make your balls of tamarind the 

00:03:04.760 --> 00:03:08.720
 you can make the size that you like 

00:03:06.350 --> 00:03:11.450
 the balls will not fit perfectly 

00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:13.300
 round but do not worry because the 

00:03:11.450 --> 00:03:17.770
 roll them over the mixture the sugar 

00:03:13.300 --> 00:03:17.770
 they will take a more round shape 

00:03:18.770 --> 00:03:23.810
 since you have all the balls made 

00:03:21.020 --> 00:03:26.540
 now if you're going to go through the mix 

00:03:23.810 --> 00:03:29.290
 of sugar takes to give them a 

00:03:26.540 --> 00:03:29.290
 better way 

00:03:29.819 --> 00:03:34.620
 and that's it, since you have all the 

00:03:32.159 --> 00:03:36.840
 balls made now sprinkle a little 

00:03:34.620 --> 00:03:38.909
 over tajÃ­n on them or if what 

00:03:36.840 --> 00:03:41.819
 you prefer you can sprinkle them with a 

00:03:38.909 --> 00:03:43.620
 little more sugar you can put them in 

00:03:41.819 --> 00:03:45.989
 the refrigerator one more time so that it 

00:03:43.620 --> 00:03:46.709
 harden a bit but I like it 

00:03:45.989 --> 00:03:49.139
 eat me the 

00:03:46.709 --> 00:03:51.510
 So smooth dating so good bonanza 

00:03:49.139 --> 00:03:53.730
