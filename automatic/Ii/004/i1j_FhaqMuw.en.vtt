00:02:05.980 --> 00:02:05.990 
just thought would be a little bit of

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:08.410 
just thought would be a little bit of
fun<00:02:06.229> I<00:02:06.469> think<00:02:06.740> we<00:02:06.829> do<00:02:07.549> some<00:02:07.880> sort<00:02:08.119> of<00:02:08.149> like

00:02:08.410 --> 00:02:08.420 
fun I think we do some sort of like

00:02:08.420 --> 00:02:10.869 
fun I think we do some sort of like

00:03:00.789 --> 00:03:00.799 
anywhere and you know i might take a

00:03:00.799 --> 00:03:02.530 
anywhere and you know i might take a
coupling<00:03:01.310> if<00:03:01.519> they're<00:03:01.819> you<00:03:02.090> know<00:03:02.209> kind<00:03:02.480> of

coupling if they're you know kind of

00:03:02.540 --> 00:03:04.420 
coupling if they're you know kind of
special<00:03:02.959> but<00:03:03.620> most<00:03:03.799> of<00:03:03.920> those<00:03:04.010> are<00:03:04.069> going<00:03:04.220> to

00:03:04.420 --> 00:03:04.430 
special but most of those are going to

00:03:04.430 --> 00:03:05.800 
special but most of those are going to
go<00:03:04.579> by<00:03:04.730> the<00:03:04.790> wayside<00:03:04.970> of<00:03:05.329> thinking<00:03:05.569> school

00:03:05.800 --> 00:03:05.810 
go by the wayside of thinking school

00:03:05.810 --> 00:03:07.629 
go by the wayside of thinking school
goals<00:03:06.049> etc<00:03:06.290> will<00:03:06.859> be<00:03:06.950> the<00:03:07.040> ones<00:03:07.190> i'm<00:03:07.370> looking
