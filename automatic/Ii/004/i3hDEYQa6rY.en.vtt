it's<00:00:47.280> a<00:00:47.309> good<00:00:47.460> question<00:00:47.760> I've<00:00:48.600> been<00:00:48.809> saying

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:49.050 
it's a good question I've been saying

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:50.119 
it's a good question I've been saying
that<00:00:49.110> should<00:00:49.289> be<00:00:49.350> any<00:00:49.469> fun<00:00:49.739> Thunderbolt

00:00:50.119 --> 00:00:50.129 
that should be any fun Thunderbolt

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:52.189 
that should be any fun Thunderbolt
Display<00:00:50.250> for<00:00:50.670> a<00:00:50.700> while<00:00:51.030> now<00:00:51.300> and<00:00:51.570> certainly

00:00:52.189 --> 00:00:52.199 
Display for a while now and certainly

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:53.540 
Display for a while now and certainly
would<00:00:52.440> make<00:00:52.559> sense<00:00:52.739> to<00:00:52.890> be<00:00:53.070> a<00:00:53.100> thinner<00:00:53.370> design

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:53.550 
would make sense to be a thinner design

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:55.459 
would make sense to be a thinner design
at<00:00:53.820> this<00:00:53.910> point<00:00:54.149> it's<00:00:54.239> thicker<00:00:54.600> than<00:00:54.930> the<00:00:55.110> iMac

00:00:55.459 --> 00:00:55.469 
at this point it's thicker than the iMac

00:00:55.469 --> 00:00:56.990 
at this point it's thicker than the iMac
which<00:00:55.680> makes<00:00:56.039> very<00:00:56.370> little<00:00:56.430> sense<00:00:56.670> because

00:00:56.990 --> 00:00:57.000 
which makes very little sense because

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:58.549 
which makes very little sense because
they're<00:00:57.120> both<00:00:57.239> the<00:00:57.390> same<00:00:57.420> resolution<00:00:57.899> 27-inch

00:00:58.549 --> 00:00:58.559 
they're both the same resolution 27-inch

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:01.189 
they're both the same resolution 27-inch
displays<00:00:59.030> but<00:01:00.030> I<00:01:00.059> would<00:01:00.359> say<00:01:00.539> we<00:01:00.690> are<00:01:00.719> going<00:01:01.079> to

00:01:01.189 --> 00:01:01.199 
displays but I would say we are going to

00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:04.969 
displays but I would say we are going to
see<00:01:01.350> 4k<00:01:01.739> very<00:01:02.399> very<00:01:03.329> very<00:01:03.719> soon<00:01:04.110> you<00:01:04.890> know

00:01:04.969 --> 00:01:04.979 
see 4k very very very soon you know

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:06.830 
see 4k very very very soon you know
currently<00:01:05.280> the<00:01:05.430> Mac<00:01:05.580> Pro<00:01:05.850> lineup<00:01:06.180> supports<00:01:06.600> 4k

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:06.840 
currently the Mac Pro lineup supports 4k

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:09.289 
currently the Mac Pro lineup supports 4k
stand<00:01:07.260> becoming<00:01:07.590> to<00:01:07.680> other<00:01:07.830> Mac's<00:01:08.130> yes<00:01:09.090> I

00:01:09.289 --> 00:01:09.299 
stand becoming to other Mac's yes I

00:01:09.299 --> 00:01:11.000 
stand becoming to other Mac's yes I
think<00:01:09.390> it<00:01:09.570> makes<00:01:09.720> sense<00:01:09.990> especially<00:01:10.409> if

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:11.010 
think it makes sense especially if

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:13.219 
think it makes sense especially if
they're<00:01:11.479> desktops<00:01:12.479> are<00:01:12.630> already<00:01:12.810> supporting

00:01:13.219 --> 00:01:13.229 
they're desktops are already supporting

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:14.179 
they're desktops are already supporting
it<00:01:13.320> you<00:01:13.470> know<00:01:13.560> like<00:01:13.619> the<00:01:13.680> Mac<00:01:13.890> Pro's

00:01:14.179 --> 00:01:14.189 
it you know like the Mac Pro's

00:01:14.189 --> 00:01:15.710 
it you know like the Mac Pro's
presumably<00:01:14.610> it'll<00:01:14.790> make<00:01:14.880> its<00:01:15.030> way<00:01:15.150> down<00:01:15.360> to

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:15.720 
presumably it'll make its way down to

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:18.350 
presumably it'll make its way down to
the<00:01:16.020> iMac<00:01:16.409> line<00:01:16.650> as<00:01:16.799> well<00:01:16.979> yes<00:01:17.729> I<00:01:17.939> absolutely

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:18.360 
the iMac line as well yes I absolutely

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:20.030 
the iMac line as well yes I absolutely
think<00:01:18.689> it's<00:01:18.869> coming<00:01:19.080> I<00:01:19.350> think<00:01:19.680> it's<00:01:19.830> going<00:01:19.979> to

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:20.040 
think it's coming I think it's going to

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:22.039 
think it's coming I think it's going to
be<00:01:20.159> coming<00:01:20.460> this<00:01:20.580> year<00:01:20.850> and<00:01:21.000> probably<00:01:21.150> have<00:01:22.020> a

be coming this year and probably have a

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:25.480 
be coming this year and probably have a
4k<00:01:22.590> price<00:01:23.250> tag<00:01:23.490> to<00:01:23.820> match<00:01:23.939> that<00:01:24.330> bork<00:01:24.930> a

00:01:25.480 --> 00:01:25.490 
4k price tag to match that bork a

inches<00:01:43.409> so<00:01:43.619> yes<00:01:43.860> I<00:01:44.009> think<00:01:44.040> it's<00:01:44.250> coming

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:44.430 
inches so yes I think it's coming

00:01:47.149 --> 00:01:47.159 
Thunderbolt 2 that one is really up in

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:48.139 
Thunderbolt 2 that one is really up in
there<00:01:47.250> but<00:01:47.399> that<00:01:47.490> Apple<00:01:47.790> wants<00:01:48.000> to<00:01:48.060> support

00:01:48.139 --> 00:01:48.149 
there but that Apple wants to support

00:01:48.149 --> 00:01:49.520 
there but that Apple wants to support
that<00:01:48.390> or<00:01:48.540> nada<00:01:48.689> just<00:01:48.899> continue<00:01:49.170> to<00:01:49.259> pushing

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:49.530

when is either LG Samsung HTC or Apple

00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:54.650 
when is either LG Samsung HTC or Apple
going<00:02:52.800> to<00:02:53.040> do<00:02:53.250> a<00:02:53.580> qk<00:02:54.090> phone<00:02:54.300> that's<00:02:54.450> probably

00:02:54.650 --> 00:02:54.660 
going to do a qk phone that's probably

00:02:54.660 --> 00:02:56.450 
going to do a qk phone that's probably
you<00:02:54.780> mean<00:02:54.930> by<00:02:55.020> major<00:02:55.290> manufacturers<00:02:55.950> on<00:02:56.430> I

00:02:56.450 --> 00:02:56.460 
you mean by major manufacturers on I

00:02:56.460 --> 00:02:57.440 
you mean by major manufacturers on I
think<00:02:56.760> we're<00:02:56.910> gonna<00:02:57.000> see<00:02:57.210> it<00:02:57.300> this<00:02:57.390> year

00:02:57.440 --> 00:02:57.450 
think we're gonna see it this year

00:02:57.450 --> 00:03:00.200 
think we're gonna see it this year
probably<00:02:57.870> later<00:02:58.170> into<00:02:58.470> the<00:02:58.560> year<00:02:58.850> rumors<00:02:59.850> of

00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:00.210 
probably later into the year rumors of

00:03:00.210 --> 00:03:02.600 
probably later into the year rumors of
sort<00:03:00.390> of<00:03:00.450> a<00:03:00.510> premium<00:03:00.900> version<00:03:01.170> Galaxy<00:03:01.800> s5<00:03:02.220> I

00:03:02.600 --> 00:03:02.610 
sort of a premium version Galaxy s5 I

00:03:02.610 --> 00:03:04.610 
sort of a premium version Galaxy s5 I
think<00:03:03.240> that<00:03:03.390> the<00:03:03.480> Galaxy<00:03:03.900> Note<00:03:04.110> one's<00:03:04.380> always

00:03:04.610 --> 00:03:04.620 
think that the Galaxy Note one's always

00:03:04.620 --> 00:03:06.020 
think that the Galaxy Note one's always
sort<00:03:04.800> of<00:03:04.860> been<00:03:04.920> the<00:03:05.160> generation<00:03:05.640> ahead<00:03:05.910> of

00:03:06.020 --> 00:03:06.030 
sort of been the generation ahead of

00:03:06.030 --> 00:03:07.190 
sort of been the generation ahead of
what<00:03:06.120> we've<00:03:06.240> seen<00:03:06.330> with<00:03:06.420> the<00:03:06.480> Galaxy<00:03:06.870> S<00:03:06.990> line

00:03:07.190 --> 00:03:07.200 
what we've seen with the Galaxy S line

00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:10.640 
what we've seen with the Galaxy S line
so<00:03:08.040> perhaps<00:03:08.310> maybe<00:03:08.700> the<00:03:08.820> note<00:03:09.030> 4<00:03:09.390> might<00:03:10.290> go<00:03:10.590> to

00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:10.650 
so perhaps maybe the note 4 might go to

00:03:10.650 --> 00:03:13.250 
so perhaps maybe the note 4 might go to
K<00:03:11.250> we've<00:03:11.850> heard<00:03:12.030> rumors<00:03:12.180> of<00:03:12.480> ultra<00:03:12.930> Retina

will have a 2k resolution the big

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:20.690 
will have a 2k resolution the big
question<00:03:19.560> is<00:03:19.650> not<00:03:19.770> what<00:03:19.920> not<00:03:20.070> that<00:03:20.220> can<00:03:20.340> do<00:03:20.550> it

00:03:20.690 --> 00:03:20.700 
question is not what not that can do it

00:03:20.700 --> 00:03:22.280 
question is not what not that can do it
but<00:03:21.210> not<00:03:21.330> they<00:03:21.450> can<00:03:21.600> keep<00:03:21.780> that<00:03:21.900> display

00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:22.290 
but not they can keep that display

00:03:22.290 --> 00:03:24.350 
but not they can keep that display
powered<00:03:22.740> while<00:03:23.520> resolutions<00:03:24.060> have<00:03:24.150> gone

00:03:24.360 --> 00:03:26.330

crazy<00:03:24.720> high<00:03:25.230> and<00:03:25.440> processors<00:03:25.890> have<00:03:26.070> gotten

00:03:26.330 --> 00:03:26.340 
crazy high and processors have gotten

00:03:26.340 --> 00:03:28.100 
crazy high and processors have gotten
more<00:03:26.490> cores<00:03:26.910> battery<00:03:27.360> technology<00:03:27.810> hasn't

00:03:28.100 --> 00:03:28.110 
more cores battery technology hasn't

00:03:28.110 --> 00:03:29.750 
more cores battery technology hasn't
really<00:03:28.260> changed<00:03:28.320> that<00:03:28.650> much<00:03:28.740> so<00:03:29.460> that's<00:03:29.610> one

00:03:29.750 --> 00:03:29.760 
really changed that much so that's one

00:03:29.760 --> 00:03:30.890 
really changed that much so that's one
of<00:03:29.820> those<00:03:29.910> manufacturers<00:03:30.450> can<00:03:30.570> do<00:03:30.630> something

00:03:30.890 --> 00:03:30.900 
of those manufacturers can do something

00:03:30.900 --> 00:03:32.510 
of those manufacturers can do something
crazy<00:03:31.200> with<00:03:31.530> battery<00:03:31.860> you're<00:03:32.250> gonna<00:03:32.370> have

00:03:32.510 --> 00:03:32.520 
crazy with battery you're gonna have

00:03:32.520 --> 00:03:34.610 
crazy with battery you're gonna have
like<00:03:32.580> a<00:03:32.640> nine<00:03:32.940> minute<00:03:33.150> life<00:03:33.420> on<00:03:33.930> your<00:03:34.320> device

00:03:34.610 --> 00:03:34.620 
like a nine minute life on your device

00:03:34.620 --> 00:03:36.050 
like a nine minute life on your device
so<00:03:35.040> that's<00:03:35.160> really<00:03:35.280> been<00:03:35.400> the<00:03:35.580> big<00:03:35.760> question

00:03:36.050 --> 00:03:36.060 
so that's really been the big question

00:03:36.060 --> 00:03:37.580 
so that's really been the big question
if<00:03:36.150> you<00:03:36.210> see<00:03:36.360> battery<00:03:36.690> life<00:03:36.840> start<00:03:37.260> to<00:03:37.350> change

00:03:37.580 --> 00:03:37.590 
if you see battery life start to change

00:03:37.590 --> 00:03:39.080 
if you see battery life start to change
and<00:03:37.890> technology<00:03:38.520> start<00:03:38.700> to<00:03:38.790> change

00:03:39.080 --> 00:03:39.090 
and technology start to change

00:03:39.090 --> 00:03:40.220 
and technology start to change
I<00:03:39.120> think<00:03:39.240> the<00:03:39.300> displays<00:03:39.600> will<00:03:39.780> come<00:03:39.930> with<00:03:40.080> it

00:03:40.220 --> 00:03:40.230 
I think the displays will come with it

00:03:40.230 --> 00:03:42.170 
I think the displays will come with it
but<00:03:41.040> I<00:03:41.070> will<00:03:41.370> say<00:03:41.520> we'll<00:03:41.670> probably<00:03:41.820> see<00:03:42.060> it

00:03:42.170 --> 00:03:42.180 
but I will say we'll probably see it

00:03:42.180 --> 00:03:43.880 
but I will say we'll probably see it
sometime<00:03:42.510> later<00:03:42.720> on<00:03:42.870> this<00:03:42.960> year<00:03:43.200> and<00:03:43.410> how<00:03:43.770> long

00:03:43.880 --> 00:03:43.890 
sometime later on this year and how long

00:03:43.890 --> 00:03:46.340 
sometime later on this year and how long
it's<00:03:44.040> gonna<00:03:44.100> last<00:03:44.220> really<00:03:44.730> anyone's<00:03:45.090> guess<00:03:45.350> me

00:03:46.340 --> 00:03:46.350 
it's gonna last really anyone's guess me
