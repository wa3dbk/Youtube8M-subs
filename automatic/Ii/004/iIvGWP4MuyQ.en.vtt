a<00:02:39.189> little<00:02:39.489> too<00:02:39.579> many<00:02:39.939> seems<00:02:40.269> like<00:02:40.659> there's<00:02:41.200> one

00:02:41.399 --> 00:02:41.409 
a little too many seems like there's one

00:02:41.409 --> 00:02:43.530 
a little too many seems like there's one
here<00:02:41.799> one<00:02:42.459> that<00:02:42.819> goes<00:02:42.939> all<00:02:43.209> the<00:02:43.239> way<00:02:43.420> around

00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:43.540 
here one that goes all the way around

00:02:43.540 --> 00:02:45.240 
here one that goes all the way around
where<00:02:43.840> to<00:02:43.959> the<00:02:44.049> green<00:02:44.230> and<00:02:44.379> the<00:02:44.439> black<00:02:44.620> touches

00:02:45.240 --> 00:02:45.250 
where to the green and the black touches

00:02:45.250 --> 00:02:47.339 
where to the green and the black touches
if<00:02:45.939> you<00:02:46.090> go<00:02:46.209> around<00:02:46.329> to<00:02:46.569> the<00:02:46.599> back<00:02:46.870> they<00:02:47.169> just

00:02:47.339 --> 00:02:47.349 
if you go around to the back they just

00:02:47.349 --> 00:02:48.929 
if you go around to the back they just
seem<00:02:47.530> that<00:02:47.709> goes<00:02:47.859> up<00:02:48.040> is<00:02:48.220> back<00:02:48.430> down<00:02:48.760> the

00:02:48.929 --> 00:02:48.939 
seem that goes up is back down the

00:02:48.939 --> 00:02:52.500 
seem that goes up is back down the
shoulders<00:02:49.409> I<00:02:50.519> mean<00:02:51.519> I'm<00:02:51.639> sure<00:02:51.669> that's<00:02:52.090> can't

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:52.510 
shoulders I mean I'm sure that's can't

00:02:52.510 --> 00:02:54.690 
shoulders I mean I'm sure that's can't
down<00:02:52.870> the<00:02:52.989> sides<00:02:53.230> can't<00:02:53.859> really<00:02:54.010> be<00:02:54.189> avoided

00:02:54.690 --> 00:02:54.700 
down the sides can't really be avoided

00:02:54.700 --> 00:02:56.759 
down the sides can't really be avoided
because<00:02:55.299> you<00:02:55.840> know<00:02:55.959> that<00:02:56.200> you've<00:02:56.290> got<00:02:56.500> to<00:02:56.620> put

00:02:56.759 --> 00:02:56.769 
because you know that you've got to put

00:02:56.769 --> 00:02:58.140 
because you know that you've got to put
a<00:02:56.799> lot<00:02:57.069> of<00:02:57.099> things<00:02:57.370> on<00:02:57.519> these<00:02:57.669> six<00:02:57.909> scale

00:02:58.140 --> 00:02:58.150 
a lot of things on these six scale

00:02:58.150 --> 00:03:00.720 
a lot of things on these six scale
figures<00:02:58.560> but<00:02:59.560> it<00:02:59.709> just<00:02:59.859> seems<00:03:00.040> like<00:03:00.220> maybe<00:03:00.459> if

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:00.730 
figures but it just seems like maybe if

00:03:00.730 --> 00:03:01.949 
figures but it just seems like maybe if
you<00:03:00.849> were<00:03:00.939> to<00:03:01.060> look<00:03:01.090> at<00:03:01.329> the<00:03:01.419> actual<00:03:01.689> costume

00:03:01.949 --> 00:03:01.959 
you were to look at the actual costume

00:03:01.959 --> 00:03:05.550 
you were to look at the actual costume
it<00:03:02.290> wouldn't<00:03:02.560> quite<00:03:02.739> be<00:03:02.799> so<00:03:04.290> duotone<00:03:05.290> like

00:03:05.550 --> 00:03:05.560 
it wouldn't quite be so duotone like

00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:07.409 
it wouldn't quite be so duotone like
that<00:03:05.739> maybe<00:03:05.950> they'd<00:03:06.220> add<00:03:06.340> maybe<00:03:07.030> I<00:03:07.180> could<00:03:07.299> have

00:03:07.409 --> 00:03:07.419 
that maybe they'd add maybe I could have

00:03:07.419 --> 00:03:08.879 
that maybe they'd add maybe I could have
used<00:03:07.510> a<00:03:07.629> different<00:03:07.930> material<00:03:08.049> or<00:03:08.530> something

00:03:08.879 --> 00:03:08.889 
used a different material or something

00:03:08.889 --> 00:03:11.129 
used a different material or something
other<00:03:09.040> than<00:03:09.220> spandex<00:03:09.730> for<00:03:10.599> the<00:03:10.689> green<00:03:10.900> or

00:03:11.129 --> 00:03:11.139 
other than spandex for the green or

00:03:11.139 --> 00:03:12.689 
other than spandex for the green or
something<00:03:11.470> like<00:03:11.590> a<00:03:11.650> pleated<00:03:12.010> material<00:03:12.579> or

00:03:12.689 --> 00:03:12.699 
something like a pleated material or

00:03:12.699 --> 00:03:14.250 
something like a pleated material or
something<00:03:12.970> then<00:03:13.150> make<00:03:13.810> it<00:03:13.930> look<00:03:14.079> a<00:03:14.139> little

00:03:14.250 --> 00:03:14.260
