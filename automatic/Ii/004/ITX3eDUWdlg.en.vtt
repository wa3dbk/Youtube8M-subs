00:00:03.830 --> 00:00:07.460
 as soon as we talk about peace education from 

00:00:06.859 --> 00:00:09.320
 Nonviolence 

00:00:07.460 --> 00:00:11.660
 there is always someone to tell us 

00:00:09.320 --> 00:00:14.540
 it's not a bit of a breeze 

00:00:11.660 --> 00:00:17.060
 and when he says that it's not very 

00:00:14.540 --> 00:00:18.619
 encouraging then opens to answer 

00:00:17.060 --> 00:00:19.669
 to the question is not a little 

00:00:18.619 --> 00:00:22.090
 Bumblebee your thing 

00:00:19.669 --> 00:00:25.460
 in fact and we lack elements 

00:00:22.090 --> 00:00:27.010
 I know my practices but I 

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:30.380
 do not know well enough that 

00:00:27.010 --> 00:00:32.809
 so with the education commission at the 

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:35.680
 peace we decided to go do a 

00:00:32.809 --> 00:00:38.449
 report to the country of bisounours 

00:00:35.680 --> 00:00:40.729
 the first thing that strikes when 

00:00:38.449 --> 00:00:42.769
 comes to kisses landes is that the 

00:00:40.729 --> 00:00:45.500
 bisounours does not seem to be subject to the 

00:00:42.769 --> 00:00:45.890
 gravity and this in every sense of the 

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:48.830
 term 

00:00:45.890 --> 00:00:52.869
 he flies away for nothing and we'll see him 

00:00:48.830 --> 00:00:52.869
 they take everything lightly 

00:01:04.150 --> 00:01:11.560
 no look here we are 

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:11.560
 the bisounours called grumpy 

00:01:12.729 --> 00:01:16.580
 you think still not it will 

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:21.500
 ask us to go up to do 

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:23.660
 a tour last year the others 

00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:25.640
 Bears who know that inventions 

00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:27.400
 grouchy are rarely reliable have 

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:30.650
 rather afraid to ride on 

00:01:27.400 --> 00:01:33.170
 we're here what did you want 

00:01:30.650 --> 00:01:34.759
 show the new rides games the 

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:36.649
 manufacture for the next fair of 

00:01:34.759 --> 00:01:40.130
 kisses landes and the first ones to try it 

00:01:36.649 --> 00:01:42.560
 knew too much world at this point 

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:43.280
 of arrival although the main emotion 

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:46.550
 in this group 

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:47.840
 she's scared it's just that you're 

00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:50.690
 remember what happened at the fair 

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:52.789
 of kisses long last year to wil 

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:53.090
 so so there has been with the mountains 

00:01:52.789 --> 00:01:55.729
 Russian 

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:57.800
 I see I'm not going to force you to 

00:01:55.729 --> 00:01:58.130
 ride his carousel if you do not have one 

00:01:57.800 --> 00:02:00.560
 desire 

00:01:58.130 --> 00:02:02.119
 except for grenon that looks like him 

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:04.360
 first of all the frustration the 

00:02:02.119 --> 00:02:04.360
 disappointment 

00:02:04.400 --> 00:02:08.330
 you know it's been so long since 

00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:11.600
 I do not even know when I went up 

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:13.640
 on a ride for the last time I 

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:15.830
 very want to take a ride and you 

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:18.260
 also you do not feel like it right and 

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:19.760
 now this bison with a cup 

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:21.800
 winner takes on the belly 

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:23.840
 his intervention consists in asking 

00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:26.060
 everyone to disregard 

00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:29.180
 their emotions to abstract from 

00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:30.410
 their fear in doing so it solves 

00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:32.690
 absolutely not the problem 

00:02:30.410 --> 00:02:34.610
 everyone feels bad about our emotions 

00:02:32.690 --> 00:02:36.680
 are the seers of our table of 

00:02:34.610 --> 00:02:39.320
 internal edge they are information 

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:41.000
 precious to deny them it really seems 

00:02:39.320 --> 00:02:43.280
 not a good idea it would be like 

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:45.020
 deliberately ignore let's see red from 

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:47.690
 oil temperature blinking in 

00:02:45.020 --> 00:02:50.080
 a car and what was to happen 

00:02:47.690 --> 00:02:50.080
 arrived 

00:02:54.900 --> 00:02:59.320
 really not sure it's a good 

00:02:56.920 --> 00:03:00.820
 idea of ​​denying these emotions have like 

00:02:59.320 --> 00:03:04.380
 it is happily in bisounours 

00:03:00.820 --> 00:03:04.380
 it's never very serious 

00:03:08.080 --> 00:03:13.000
 finally still a little serious anyway 

00:03:23.819 --> 00:03:30.340
 poor onions makes the trip fun 

00:03:27.489 --> 00:03:33.310
 him those big jojo you'll see he's a 

00:03:30.340 --> 00:03:35.019
 little mocking but still a little bad 

00:03:33.310 --> 00:03:38.470
 dangerous this attraction is going to have to 

00:03:35.019 --> 00:03:43.319
 forbid I will not contradict if we 

00:03:38.470 --> 00:03:43.319
 says that the agro dion is damn vexed 

00:03:45.300 --> 00:03:49.950
 and abuse of all the bigjean spas but 

00:03:48.570 --> 00:03:52.080
 rather than talking about his emotions of 

00:03:49.950 --> 00:03:56.250
 to say that he is upset he is speaking to big 

00:03:52.080 --> 00:03:58.380
 jojo with a message that he tells him do you 

00:03:56.250 --> 00:04:02.570
 you 're not happy with everything is not necessarily 

00:03:58.380 --> 00:04:02.570
 the discussion is not advancing so much 

00:04:03.860 --> 00:04:11.010
 nothing observe the reaction of the world 

00:04:08.090 --> 00:04:13.320
 finally we can say that some 

00:04:11.010 --> 00:04:16.170
 problems are best resolved between four 

00:04:13.320 --> 00:04:19.590
 eyes because there the look of others 

00:04:16.170 --> 00:04:22.830
 give an audience jojo agro and comes 

00:04:19.590 --> 00:04:25.610
 add shame to the vexation of 

00:04:22.830 --> 00:04:25.610
 big lyon 

00:04:28.130 --> 00:04:30.580
 Ohler 

00:04:33.760 --> 00:04:39.160
 decidedly really good at 

00:04:36.200 --> 00:04:39.160
 fun rides 

00:04:42.310 --> 00:04:51.440
 that 's it that's it that's it 

00:04:48.460 --> 00:04:53.780
 it does not matter much grenon calm down 

00:04:51.440 --> 00:04:55.280
 no one was hurt it's still 

00:04:53.780 --> 00:04:57.800
 that's the most important you do not think 

00:04:55.280 --> 00:05:01.160
 note the intervention of 7.2 this 

00:04:57.800 --> 00:05:03.229
 orange teddy bear with two hearts him to 

00:05:01.160 --> 00:05:07.180
 his turn is in the negation of 

00:05:03.229 --> 00:05:09.320
 feelings he minimizes the problem 

00:05:07.180 --> 00:05:11.960
 grenon does not feel at all understood 

00:05:09.320 --> 00:05:12.950
 by the way it does not miss that it does not have 

00:05:11.960 --> 00:05:15.380
 all the expected effect 

00:05:12.950 --> 00:05:28.880
 instead of calming grumpy he gets angry 

00:05:15.380 --> 00:05:34.070
 even more did not work it's very 

00:05:28.880 --> 00:05:36.560
 good of what is not well listened to a 

00:05:34.070 --> 00:05:38.630
 little bit that's good it's not good 

00:05:36.560 --> 00:05:40.250
 it's okay it's wrong the judgment the 

00:05:38.630 --> 00:05:46.070
 judgment the judgment that comes 

00:05:40.250 --> 00:05:48.140
 to deteriorate the relationship it's true that 

00:05:46.070 --> 00:05:49.860
 concerned about the feelings of others that 

00:05:48.140 --> 00:05:51.539
 often helps with the relationship 

00:05:49.860 --> 00:05:53.159
 if you did not understand that it's 

00:05:51.539 --> 00:05:55.710
 maybe you did not cry to do it 

00:05:53.159 --> 00:05:57.569
 a slow kiss if you did not understand that 

00:05:55.710 --> 00:05:59.000
 it may be that you have nothing left to 

00:05:57.569 --> 00:06:02.039
 make a kiss moors 

00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:05.400
 another message you do not speak of 

00:06:02.039 --> 00:06:08.879
 him that he makes a diagnosis on his 

00:06:05.400 --> 00:06:09.449
 big boyfriend jojo necessarily it closes the 

00:06:08.879 --> 00:06:11.430
 discussion 

00:06:09.449 --> 00:06:13.199
 and besides, it does not miss the 

00:06:11.430 --> 00:06:16.849
 discussion is broken the problem is 

00:06:13.199 --> 00:06:16.849
 not resolved and both parties angry 

00:06:18.410 --> 00:06:23.280
 I am really obliged in the 

00:06:21.180 --> 00:06:24.330
 category it is really bad for 

00:06:23.280 --> 00:06:28.830
 solve problems 

00:06:24.330 --> 00:06:30.360
 now it's rising crescendo hello 

00:06:28.830 --> 00:06:32.490
 joy never intended to 

00:06:30.360 --> 00:06:34.110
 to hurt and I believe you 

00:06:32.490 --> 00:06:36.750
 feel better both once 

00:06:34.110 --> 00:06:39.090
 that you told them I'm sorry we 

00:06:36.750 --> 00:06:41.280
 imposes on one of the two bishops 

00:06:39.090 --> 00:06:43.349
 who are angry to come and apologize 

00:06:41.280 --> 00:06:44.879
 with each other how many times have I 

00:06:43.349 --> 00:06:47.520
 seen doing that in real life 

00:06:44.879 --> 00:06:49.530
 are you kisses 

00:06:47.520 --> 00:06:51.630
 the hand as long as people are not at 

00:06:49.530 --> 00:06:52.139
 again sincerely pleased to be 

00:06:51.630 --> 00:06:53.699
 together 

00:06:52.139 --> 00:06:56.400
 it's useless to be wicked 

00:06:53.699 --> 00:06:58.169
 they missed an essential phase of 

00:06:56.400 --> 00:07:00.300
 reconciliation process 

00:06:58.169 --> 00:07:01.860
 this is the phase where we listen to each other 

00:07:00.300 --> 00:07:03.990
 said things told me about his 

00:07:01.860 --> 00:07:06.659
 emotions and we come to reformulate them 

00:07:03.990 --> 00:07:07.729
 all that I do not see in the land of 

00:07:06.659 --> 00:07:10.169
 Care Bears 

00:07:07.729 --> 00:07:11.789
 you know me when it comes to saying I 

00:07:10.169 --> 00:07:12.900
 I'm sorry I'm not good at it 

00:07:11.789 --> 00:07:14.880
 will not be able to put that tomorrow 

00:07:12.900 --> 00:07:16.500
 interesting that to grumpy who says he 

00:07:14.880 --> 00:07:18.449
 is not very comfortable to say I 

00:07:16.500 --> 00:07:21.569
 I'm sorry and surely because we got it 

00:07:18.449 --> 00:07:23.039
 obliged to say it and necessarily when we 

00:07:21.569 --> 00:07:24.949
 say something you do not feel 

00:07:23.039 --> 00:07:27.750
 in the heart of his heart we do not feel well 

00:07:24.949 --> 00:07:28.830
 and again that violence in 

00:07:27.750 --> 00:07:30.690
 group pressure 

00:07:28.830 --> 00:07:33.210
 does he really need to have 

00:07:30.690 --> 00:07:35.279
 twelve people they watch for 

00:07:33.210 --> 00:07:37.620
 go apologize to his boyfriend 

00:07:35.279 --> 00:07:40.580
 what violence she really 

00:07:37.620 --> 00:07:43.289
 group pressure is immense immense 

00:07:40.580 --> 00:07:45.479
 we've had enough for today 

00:07:43.289 --> 00:07:47.719
 I think that really the methods we 

00:07:45.479 --> 00:07:50.789
 proposes are a little more evolved than 

00:07:47.719 --> 00:07:51.659
 the one that buns 

00:07:50.789 --> 00:07:54.389
 luckily by the way 

00:07:51.659 --> 00:07:56.430
 rather go read the guide educate to the 

00:07:54.389 --> 00:08:00.139
 peace available on digital biotech 

00:07:56.430 --> 00:08:00.139
 it's a little bit more than that
