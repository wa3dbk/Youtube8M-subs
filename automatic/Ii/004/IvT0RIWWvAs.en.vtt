00:00:13.789 --> 00:00:16.779
 I can receive this packet sent to Yamakita 

00:00:16.779 --> 00:00:18.519
 Accumulation 

00:00:18.519 --> 00:00:20.070
 It was not local 

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:22.909
 I'm calling tomorrow 

00:00:22.909 --> 00:00:24.130
 It is not so 

00:00:24.130 --> 00:00:26.369
 Win hands with citizens 

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:29.369
 Handwriting 

00:00:30.849 --> 00:00:32.650
 Get well started 

00:00:32.650 --> 00:00:34.080
 I am fine 

00:00:34.080 --> 00:00:36.010
 Fresh water surface 

00:00:36.010 --> 00:00:39.820
 I was crying every day during the game but now I am getting better 

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:44.850
 Everyone was very sad 

00:00:47.490 --> 00:00:50.990
 Recently my mom has been making dozens of times every three days 

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:54.840
 It was every day I loved every day 

00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:58.770
 To be worried 

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:02.640
 To be able to perform an act that is not good 

00:01:03.330 --> 00:01:06.180
 Welcome to the digital world now 

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:07.520
 From the real world 

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:10.000
 I can not see your world, 

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:13.000
 Monthly basis is released and is still evolving 

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:16.880
 It has changed to your world 

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:19.880
 I was studying network and program now 

00:01:20.750 --> 00:01:23.910
 For a researcher who wants to be a father 

00:01:23.910 --> 00:01:25.980
 Even the fathers who created Dejima 

00:01:25.980 --> 00:01:27.210
 It is this time 

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:30.310
 We are continuing research on district designation in the world 

00:01:30.310 --> 00:01:32.600
 Digital items in the real world 

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:35.600
 It will change from now on 

00:01:36.220 --> 00:01:39.220
 Get through the capacity 

00:01:40.750 --> 00:01:42.870
 There is something that does not change 

00:01:42.870 --> 00:01:46.150
 I know for now 

00:01:46.150 --> 00:01:48.490
 I only spent time with you 

00:01:48.490 --> 00:01:51.430
 Domestic connection prohibition 

00:01:51.430 --> 00:01:53.180
 I die against the city 

00:01:53.180 --> 00:01:56.180
 Actually expanded 

00:01:57.640 --> 00:02:00.680
 I was a friend 

00:02:00.680 --> 00:02:02.960
 Best shape 

00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:05.960
 That's right Piano 

00:02:07.949 --> 00:02:11.279
 At the top of the world, including the successor 

00:02:11.279 --> 00:02:14.309
 I am very fun 

00:02:14.309 --> 00:02:16.169
 I went to the game center 

00:02:16.169 --> 00:02:18.639
 It does not change to the world 

00:02:18.639 --> 00:02:20.599
 What must not be true 

00:02:20.599 --> 00:02:23.599
 I said a few words 

00:02:24.989 --> 00:02:27.769
 Tsukushi Clover 

00:02:27.769 --> 00:02:30.769
 I've called it now 

00:02:33.739 --> 00:02:36.209
 It softened after being domestic 

00:02:36.209 --> 00:02:39.209
 I was just cowardly 

00:02:40.079 --> 00:02:42.869
 Not only was it from the beginning 

00:02:42.869 --> 00:02:44.269
 I 

00:02:44.269 --> 00:02:46.929
 It is a departure from Mr. Tatsumi 

00:02:46.929 --> 00:02:49.799
 Belongs to that land 

00:02:49.799 --> 00:02:52.589
 Don't use grapes for singing from Fukuoka Prefecture 

00:02:52.589 --> 00:02:55.729
 I understand well 

00:02:55.729 --> 00:02:57.499
 Such can not be avoided 

00:02:57.499 --> 00:02:59.939
 Northern 

00:02:59.939 --> 00:03:02.939
 I am not myself I am convinced 

00:03:05.809 --> 00:03:08.909
 I decided to endure 

00:03:08.909 --> 00:03:11.479
 The country can not be accepted 

00:03:11.479 --> 00:03:14.179
 It is said that this new acceptance was not accepted 

00:03:14.179 --> 00:03:17.179
 Surely time is limited 

00:03:18.559 --> 00:03:21.739
 nqn 

00:03:21.739 --> 00:03:24.599
 I told you that I wanted a survey result 

00:03:24.599 --> 00:03:26.479
 I got the word 

00:03:26.479 --> 00:03:29.479
 It was made especially convenient 

00:03:30.919 --> 00:03:33.919
 You've been in this world full of wounds 

00:03:35.049 --> 00:03:37.769
 100 understood 

00:03:37.769 --> 00:03:39.279
 To such me 

00:03:39.279 --> 00:03:42.279
 You said gently 

00:03:46.369 --> 00:03:49.619
 Why did you want such a Chinese thing 

00:03:49.619 --> 00:03:52.059
 I was a little strange 

00:03:52.059 --> 00:03:55.599
 Also, after six people talk about bankruptcy every year, Japanese is included 

00:03:55.599 --> 00:03:57.529
 More courtesy visit of was 

00:03:57.529 --> 00:03:59.939
 It was not natural 

00:03:59.939 --> 00:04:02.939
 I have been holding poisons for a long time 

00:04:03.639 --> 00:04:06.639
 21.85 million times with your lips 

00:04:09.889 --> 00:04:12.569
 I heard that word in your site 

00:04:12.569 --> 00:04:15.489
 Digital 

00:04:15.489 --> 00:04:18.489
 I always thought 

00:04:19.279 --> 00:04:20.629
 Why not 

00:04:20.629 --> 00:04:23.629
 Did you know 50,000 titles won? 

00:04:24.659 --> 00:04:25.930
 It was a little 

00:04:25.930 --> 00:04:28.349
 The city is from Digital World 2 o'clock 

00:04:28.349 --> 00:04:31.349
 I did not hear the national anthem of the country playing the game 

00:04:33.340 --> 00:04:36.580
 I do not use the word 150,000 times in this case 

00:04:36.580 --> 00:04:39.969
 I used at ibm's time 

00:04:39.969 --> 00:04:43.969
 At that time you were not the country I was the power to send 

00:04:43.969 --> 00:04:46.969
 I did not get the qualification 

00:04:48.159 --> 00:04:50.840
 I understood 

00:04:50.840 --> 00:04:53.020
 That I am inside 

00:04:53.020 --> 00:04:56.020
 You were feeling somehow 

00:04:58.490 --> 00:05:01.490
 Osim 

00:05:02.020 --> 00:05:05.020
 It has always been a coincidence 

00:05:07.129 --> 00:05:10.129
 Your pucci world 

00:05:10.129 --> 00:05:13.129
 I thought you could understand your own feelings 

00:05:14.249 --> 00:05:17.139
 Sennanized 

00:05:17.139 --> 00:05:18.439
 You are 

00:05:18.439 --> 00:05:21.439
 I chose it on June 1 

00:05:25.189 --> 00:05:28.639
 I said so 

00:05:28.639 --> 00:05:31.639
 I was coming here 

00:05:35.469 --> 00:05:38.710
 tv was 

00:05:38.710 --> 00:05:40.860
 listener 

00:05:40.860 --> 00:05:42.160
 We will always
