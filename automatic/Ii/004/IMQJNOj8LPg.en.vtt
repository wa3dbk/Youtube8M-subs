than<00:02:50.180> risk<00:02:50.420> it<00:02:50.540> I<00:02:50.600> think<00:02:50.780> we<00:02:50.870> might<00:02:51.020> eat<00:02:51.170> this

00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:51.290 
than risk it I think we might eat this

00:02:51.290 --> 00:02:53.320 
than risk it I think we might eat this
right<00:02:51.560> the<00:02:52.160> way<00:02:52.310> to<00:02:52.370> practice<00:02:52.550> conservation
