00:00:06.430 --> 00:00:14.040
 I really lost 

00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:17.780
 I think that area is expensive when it is difficult to be a Shoji 1-win 

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:20.710
 It was a bit of an interventional obstruction, though 

00:00:17.780 --> 00:00:23.020
 Well so good 

00:00:20.710 --> 00:00:25.060
 Fluff Idei Nde there is no sense 

00:00:23.020 --> 00:00:31.060
 Considering that side 

00:00:25.060 --> 00:00:34.880
 By've been able to the other is roughly towards the now heart by adjusting the degree that does not leave that tired 

00:00:31.060 --> 00:00:38.330
 Tteyuu all right kana if Shiteyare a little turned on after 

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:41.120
 It was adjustment nowadays I won't move for a lifetime 

00:00:38.330 --> 00:00:47.719
 I thought that the movement age was not r good movement 

00:00:41.120 --> 00:00:49.310
 There is a lot of Baba also smart falcons and ships that are already close to each other but they have children but they have some babaa 

00:00:47.719 --> 00:00:50.270
 why 

00:00:49.310 --> 00:00:52.160
 somehow 

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:54.340
 End of the year 

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:57.930
 I feel good and finish 

00:00:54.340 --> 00:00:57.930
 I think I want to change my name soon 

00:00:58.270 --> 00:01:07.940
 The previous race is too much 

00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:15.020
 Espoir 7 than I thought a little like the state 

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:17.909
 I've stretched quickly so I'm forced to head first and then I'm still in front of the goal 

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:20.400
 I want to use that sky 

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:24.330
 I Because it is there is no way Matsuura 

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:27.690
 It's a really well done station, and today that variety 

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:30.480
 Ao based on the assumption that a little match Mao 

00:01:27.690 --> 00:01:32.280
 Just put a little behind 

00:01:30.480 --> 00:01:36.140
 Chip or blue 

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:38.409
 The goal is to flood the low floor 

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:38.409
 In 

00:01:39.100 --> 00:01:45.200
 Preceding 

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:47.560
 That kind of training that now comes out 

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:52.810
 I Since it has been doing from around last week 

00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:53.900
 There are a lot of things that you can do with guns from home even if you get into a race 

00:01:52.810 --> 00:01:59.710
 I think 

00:01:53.900 --> 00:02:04.930
 I think that it wasn't the price movement as it will be 12 300 for another day already 

00:01:59.710 --> 00:02:08.400
 I think you'll have a high horse it because you bought in June, well understood the course itself 

00:02:04.930 --> 00:02:08.400
 I think it 's okay 

00:02:08.899 --> 00:02:17.540
 I came back from the previous run sister little that grazing 

00:02:12.230 --> 00:02:19.460
 And without putting a place , I became a jc dirt of that buzz production but 

00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:23.690
 Hey school 

00:02:19.460 --> 00:02:28.610
 I was told that I was running with power, but I'm still really the last one 

00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:32.980
 g I think it is a horse , I firmly stepped on that bridge until the end 

00:02:28.610 --> 00:02:40.670
 I think that horse racing satisfactory than had been thought that the well had 

00:02:32.980 --> 00:02:46.880
 Really that as well Hey crispy horse by using by hitting one time using it run before 

00:02:40.670 --> 00:02:52.010
 Another Really I'd thought outright chase final in the individual outright chase 1 week ago last week 

00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:54.880
 jc dart is better than the time already and the movement is already better and better 

00:02:52.010 --> 00:02:58.060
 Well this horse original good luck 

00:02:54.880 --> 00:03:01.350
 That's what the hand feels like 

00:02:58.060 --> 00:03:05.330
 I can feel gold Well this time is true 

00:03:01.350 --> 00:03:08.810
 Well sound to a member that has been fought many times much many times 

00:03:05.330 --> 00:03:12.780
 It's up to you or you 

00:03:08.810 --> 00:03:16.650
 I think that can be raced in the state of thorough proudly 

00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:19.459
 It is in a state where the force is exhausted enough 

00:03:16.650 --> 00:03:19.459
 I think I can come 

00:03:19.890 --> 00:03:28.220
 I think that I have the same ability as the top, but by deployment, I'm locked in a little bit at home 

00:03:25.620 --> 00:03:32.540
 The horse is no longer motivated 

00:03:28.220 --> 00:03:34.810
 Well there was a lot of feelings like that, but it was said that it was a big hit 

00:03:32.540 --> 00:03:39.520
 Kedomo will be a little mouth and teeth 

00:03:34.810 --> 00:03:41.780
 About this time Nde me Well, But So show me aware of it we do say improvement Well 

00:03:39.520 --> 00:03:46.010
 I made it while 

00:03:41.780 --> 00:03:49.340
 The last time I did not run at all as I did not disturb my breath 

00:03:46.010 --> 00:03:52.640
 Because it makes Ano Bitchiri to some extent in that sense 

00:03:49.340 --> 00:03:57.650
 I think that the deployment is also pasted a little this time 

00:03:52.640 --> 00:03:58.910
 I think it will do good horse racing, but the horse is fine and strong, and today 

00:03:57.650 --> 00:04:01.740
 Keep up fast 

00:03:58.910 --> 00:04:06.270
 Well Iwata Jockey I will end well 

00:04:01.740 --> 00:04:09.950
 That's why I said it was better to have a more lively horse than before 

00:04:06.270 --> 00:04:14.650
 Yeah I Nde I think to run there is no firm Hashire spring inferiority 

00:04:09.950 --> 00:04:16.030
 Well above it will go at the pace of about beat it though is strong 

00:04:14.650 --> 00:04:20.470
 just that 

00:04:16.030 --> 00:04:21.910
 Because I practice, I can not break it down here once more 

00:04:20.470 --> 00:04:23.130
 In other words 

00:04:21.910 --> 00:04:29.070
 Go 

00:04:23.130 --> 00:04:31.670
 Since also can check Fuse it to there is also the feeling that ability 

00:04:29.070 --> 00:04:31.670
 I will do my best 

00:04:32.360 --> 00:04:37.150
 It is okay once 

00:04:34.260 --> 00:04:39.289
 You've been firmly in the middle movement 

00:04:37.150 --> 00:04:42.439
 I feel like I 'm coming home 

00:04:39.289 --> 00:04:46.309
 The whole clock was a little later than planned but 

00:04:42.439 --> 00:04:49.939
 But I think that the content of that run was good 

00:04:46.309 --> 00:04:59.310
 It will be born from the previous run but the first ride will be a little bigger 

00:04:49.939 --> 00:05:00.230
 I'm going there there and I'll try again here 

00:04:59.310 --> 00:05:02.270
 U 

00:05:00.230 --> 00:05:08.139
 Empty force 

00:05:02.270 --> 00:05:11.639
 Also because we have been enhanced wear I would like to shear of horse 

00:05:08.139 --> 00:05:15.310
 Either as Well softening content-class to anywhere in the field 

00:05:11.639 --> 00:05:16.610
 Even if I think I can do a shameless Ace 

00:05:15.310 --> 00:05:18.249
 Expect it 

00:05:16.610 --> 00:05:20.789
 See 

00:05:18.249 --> 00:05:20.789
 I saw it
