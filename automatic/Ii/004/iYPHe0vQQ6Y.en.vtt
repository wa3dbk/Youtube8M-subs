00:00:00.649 --> 00:00:04.339
 The autumn semester has begun at the home universities and with him 

00:00:04.339 --> 00:00:08.580
 old problems have tightened new individual subjects 

00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:13.319
 a record inflow of students which leads to capacity problems 

00:00:13.319 --> 00:00:16.149
 Science Minister therefore proposes for individual subjects 

00:00:16.149 --> 00:00:17.620
 access restrictions 

00:00:17.620 --> 00:00:18.710
 to reintroduce 

00:00:18.710 --> 00:00:21.480
 but this was abolished only in the previous year 

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:25.130
 the study of journalism and communication sciences at the university 

00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:29.590
 Vienna is one of those subjects as well as radio German students stormed 

00:00:29.590 --> 00:00:31.279
 become 

00:00:31.279 --> 00:00:35.410
 still the Soul II Soul and waiting for his seat was TuS Audimax 

00:00:35.410 --> 00:00:38.520
 Always the biggest is July to the sound and University of Vienna 

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:41.450
 and even today will be too small for his Herzlake 

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:45.740
 Inquiry in Artern Martin Burkert Merkel advertised for it has a lot of content 

00:00:45.740 --> 00:00:49.260
 The site is a center gate market when it really can be easier 

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:55.240
 Stegner told Feldkamp how 1000,000 students valued an unknown world 

00:00:55.240 --> 00:00:58.360
 come this afternoon to introductory lecture in the subject 

00:00:58.360 --> 00:01:01.060
 Journalism and communication sciences 

00:01:01.060 --> 00:01:04.930
 A new record in recent years has had a leadership team 

00:01:04.930 --> 00:01:09.550
 Esther slightly slowed the steady increase in student numbers 

00:01:09.550 --> 00:01:13.370
 that has abolished the policy in the previous year now remains the 

00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:14.940
 Reintroducing this height 

00:01:14.940 --> 00:01:19.490
 The only way out through emergency paraphrase has been shown to be this 

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:23.570
 Separate selection procedure Attention sign agreed with the students 

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:25.250
 to be tested carefully 

00:01:25.250 --> 00:01:28.300
 these studies of journalism and communication science 

00:01:28.300 --> 00:01:32.190
 because the right thing for me all just reassurance for the public 

00:01:32.190 --> 00:01:35.520
 One of the student representatives is in our opinion not the right one 

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:36.020
 path 

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:38.190
 There are also the empirical values ​​that I have 

00:01:38.190 --> 00:01:42.620
 after the first night in the first semester after the first two semesters a relative 

00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:43.720
 small children 

00:01:43.720 --> 00:01:47.420
 The journalism is among the fastest growing not sure in the world 

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:51.229
 Last year have come about 1000 150 new ones 

00:01:51.229 --> 00:01:55.609
 this year it is about 1000 400 the number of Germans is rising the strongest 

00:01:55.609 --> 00:01:59.920
 Students at the University of Vienna are recording a record high of 

00:01:59.920 --> 00:02:01.170
 freshmen 

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:06.729
 until the 15th of October of the regular registration period this year has 13 thousand 

00:02:06.729 --> 00:02:12.170
 800 students new in area in the previous winter semester were 12 thousand 500 

00:02:13.079 --> 00:02:17.659
 the policy Kommern a debate on the question of how many places to study 

00:02:17.659 --> 00:02:21.919
 LifeStar Act of the Ultimate must not be funded in life 

00:02:21.919 --> 00:02:23.129
 to go the direction 

00:02:23.129 --> 00:02:24.229
 do you want about 

00:02:24.229 --> 00:02:27.829
 but in large areas in Germany but also in Denmark in 

00:02:27.829 --> 00:02:29.059
 other countries 

00:02:29.059 --> 00:02:33.319
 that is exactly shown in which areas is full how many 

00:02:33.319 --> 00:02:37.599
 Give places and this is enough to finance who this year 

00:02:37.599 --> 00:02:39.989
 has to start again is still fighting 

00:02:39.989 --> 00:02:43.200
 what adapt to the circumstances that does not need any 

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:46.200
 Entrance exams Access restrictions 

00:02:46.869 --> 00:02:50.429
 Dense clouds on and against mornings would hold it right 

00:02:51.359 --> 00:02:53.779
 when I will spend the people 

00:02:53.779 --> 00:02:55.419
 want the night before 

00:02:55.419 --> 00:02:57.559
 even the students are divided 

00:02:57.559 --> 00:03:00.679
 like the politicians 

00:03:00.679 --> 00:03:01.549
 now it's on 

00:03:01.549 --> 00:03:04.849
 We would like to have a discussion Science Minister Johannes Hahn 

00:03:04.849 --> 00:03:08.159
 but he let us out of customers but canceled 

00:03:08.159 --> 00:03:12.040
 No major problems had with Martin Billhardt chairman rarely 

00:03:12.040 --> 00:03:13.029
 have the land 

00:03:13.029 --> 00:03:14.299
 from Marbach 

00:03:14.299 --> 00:03:18.260
 given the student tide which is now on Austria's university future remains 

00:03:18.260 --> 00:03:21.549
 There is nothing else to do but head over to access restrictions again 

00:03:21.549 --> 00:03:24.769
 For example, they are destroying the places to study 

00:03:25.409 --> 00:03:28.780
 Arndt this that I now the culprits put the times a single goal 

00:03:28.779 --> 00:03:32.120
 not so clear is the world is just too little money there and this 

00:03:32.120 --> 00:03:34.669
 Strategic chronic underfunding exists with us 

00:03:34.669 --> 00:03:35.799
 are confronted 

00:03:35.799 --> 00:03:39.290
 and the politician knows she does not do anything about it and does not work anymore 

00:03:39.290 --> 00:03:40.099
 money 

00:03:40.099 --> 00:03:44.079
 and Peters has to be a clear answer because we do not have enough students 

00:03:44.079 --> 00:03:48.089
 FC international studies too few academics said international study 

00:03:48.089 --> 00:03:51.579
 we also have 50 percent 15 in the field of freshmen 

00:03:51.579 --> 00:03:54.329
 Percent less than the youth feared as dead 

00:03:54.329 --> 00:03:57.770
 of course you could say Messi you are too little money there 

00:03:57.770 --> 00:04:01.010
 we had students we may have more money we have now 

00:04:01.010 --> 00:04:03.740
 is missing after the introduction of tuition fees are not the 

00:04:03.740 --> 00:04:07.560
 Conditions and other developments at the University of Konstanz are nothing 

00:04:07.560 --> 00:04:08.880
 has changed on the contrary 

00:04:08.880 --> 00:04:10.819
 the conditions have even worsened 

00:04:10.819 --> 00:04:14.199
 So this argument found the parents is but under the current 

00:04:14.199 --> 00:04:16.609
 Conditions ever there 

00:04:16.609 --> 00:04:19.810
 From Seat efficient procedures also fast students to many students 

00:04:19.810 --> 00:04:20.729
 have that 

00:04:20.729 --> 00:04:23.339
 Of course we see the problems and there are massive problems 

00:04:23.339 --> 00:04:26.210
 Capacity issues think about them 

00:04:26.210 --> 00:04:28.930
 Basically you have to ask the question but what is this 

00:04:28.930 --> 00:04:33.450
 Efficient studies claim friends of the and Daum it then needs to watch massive 

00:04:33.449 --> 00:04:37.199
 Expansion in terms of money and testing that is the only answer to these questions 

00:04:37.199 --> 00:04:39.290
 it is the only answer 

00:04:39.290 --> 00:04:43.110
 there is he 11 the corporation deserved so well done crime belongs second 

00:04:43.110 --> 00:04:44.340
 Answer we have food 

00:04:44.340 --> 00:04:46.139
 on for years 

00:04:46.139 --> 00:04:49.849
 always attach but unfortunately not be heard Arn we just have to 

00:04:49.849 --> 00:04:53.169
 the do not recognize the study times assume that was not in the schools 

00:04:53.169 --> 00:04:57.229
 give better advice and van Buyten first information so that they themselves 

00:04:57.229 --> 00:05:00.039
 really can decide the right study the problem is we 

00:05:00.039 --> 00:05:02.249
 Do not have that, of course, the animals have more 

00:05:02.249 --> 00:05:06.039
 the one in the major fields of study know and then go there No what 

00:05:06.039 --> 00:05:08.680
 actually speaks against that everything as it used to 

00:05:08.680 --> 00:05:14.000
 after a semester so a kind of art rock performing place where then becomes 

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:17.089
 those who can not or do not want to write 

00:05:17.089 --> 00:05:20.309
 Meier we have and we do not go to the exams and if we have the performance 

00:05:20.309 --> 00:05:23.739
 then jump there then happens then Reid may not know then 

00:05:23.739 --> 00:05:26.829
 Brinkmann made them for every single project with those children 

00:05:26.829 --> 00:05:30.689
 Not every test would result in the sale of the study 

00:05:30.689 --> 00:05:34.559
 There are also quite a few months DAX set and Manfred is still there 

00:05:34.559 --> 00:05:35.759
 on 

00:05:35.759 --> 00:05:36.930
 So um 

00:05:36.930 --> 00:05:39.930
 that is, Commons access restrictions mean that he is not in any form of question 

00:05:40.830 --> 00:05:44.510
 Oh know it says that comes to the policy about it in concrete terms 

00:05:44.509 --> 00:05:47.259
 doing and something like that 

00:05:47.259 --> 00:05:50.930
 Do not think about strike action on earth for the first time 

00:05:50.930 --> 00:05:54.190
 of course we have fallen for it and take all measures 

00:05:54.190 --> 00:05:56.389
 that are needed to protest against it 

00:05:56.389 --> 00:05:57.550
 for example 

00:05:57.550 --> 00:05:58.509
 for example 

00:05:58.509 --> 00:06:00.710
 Whatever with the US National Negotiations 

00:06:00.710 --> 00:06:02.080
 it will start with 

00:06:02.080 --> 00:06:03.429
 by Martin Borck for the conversation
