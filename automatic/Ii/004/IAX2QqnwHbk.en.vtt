00:00:04.990 --> 00:00:09.879
 today welcome this is download web.com and 

00:00:08.260 --> 00:00:13.150
 we present the unboxing and view 

00:00:09.879 --> 00:00:15.549
 after the gtx 780'll tell Cudós of 

00:00:13.150 --> 00:00:17.890
 asus among its characteristics the already 

00:00:15.549 --> 00:00:20.079
 known from q2 that improves the 

00:00:17.890 --> 00:00:22.060
 refrigeration by 30% compared to 

00:00:20.079 --> 00:00:22.630
 reference model and the system dif 

00:00:22.060 --> 00:00:25.029
 plus 

00:00:22.630 --> 00:00:26.800
 vr m with 10 power phases that 

00:00:25.029 --> 00:00:28.599
 this translates into a reduction of 

00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:30.820
 30 percent of the electrical noise already 

00:00:28.599 --> 00:00:32.500
 an increase in performance of 15 per 

00:00:30.820 --> 00:00:34.780
 hundred 

00:00:32.500 --> 00:00:36.580
 now let's go first with the 

00:00:34.780 --> 00:00:38.890
 unboxing let's take out the card inside 

00:00:36.580 --> 00:00:40.420
 of this wrapper that as we see by the 

00:00:38.890 --> 00:00:43.020
 outside part something marks us that is the 

00:00:40.420 --> 00:00:45.340
 version use with schuster and gigas of ram 

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:46.660
 compatibility with the good physical by 

00:00:45.340 --> 00:00:49.090
 the back a little color is 

00:00:46.660 --> 00:00:51.820
 generalized information on this card 

00:00:49.090 --> 00:00:54.400
 with its highlights as day 2 on the day 

00:00:51.820 --> 00:00:55.510
 even rm etcetera etcetera well 

00:00:54.400 --> 00:00:57.190
 let's go for the product that is 

00:00:55.510 --> 00:01:00.449
 really what interests us first 

00:00:57.190 --> 00:01:00.449
 let's take it out of the box 

00:01:05.650 --> 00:01:11.080
 well here we have that good box box 

00:01:08.860 --> 00:01:12.790
 very elegant black reminds us of others 

00:01:11.080 --> 00:01:14.800
 models from other manufacturers in this 

00:01:12.790 --> 00:01:17.260
 case with the logo in golden color 

00:01:14.800 --> 00:01:19.870
 we will open and inside what 

00:01:17.260 --> 00:01:22.110
 we find good well wrapped everything is 

00:01:19.870 --> 00:01:24.900
 a sort of case 

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:28.910
 I imagine that he will have what comes 

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:28.910
 being driver manuals 

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:36.860
 effectively here we find what it is 

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:36.860
 a little bit all the paperwork 

00:01:38.020 --> 00:01:42.310
 and the accessories about not bringing 

00:01:40.420 --> 00:01:44.200
 many accessories in this case be 

00:01:42.310 --> 00:01:46.600
 normal of the theme of cous and others we have 

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:49.329
 here the power cord for the 

00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:50.679
 moles the cedé with the driver and twitpic 

00:01:49.329 --> 00:01:53.020
 which is a utility to do the 

00:01:50.679 --> 00:01:57.430
 overclock safely and we found 

00:01:53.020 --> 00:02:00.040
 the quick configuration manual icon 

00:01:57.430 --> 00:02:01.660
 not bad at all so what 

00:02:00.040 --> 00:02:05.140
 you need also you can download it 

00:02:01.660 --> 00:02:06.760
 from your official website here something 

00:02:05.140 --> 00:02:09.190
 very curious that is that we can 

00:02:06.760 --> 00:02:11.320
 customize what has been the 

00:02:09.190 --> 00:02:13.000
 graphic card in this pressure with red 

00:02:11.320 --> 00:02:15.190
 in golden color as we will see more 

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:16.930
 forward when it comes completely black 

00:02:15.190 --> 00:02:18.490
 what the card with the spaces 

00:02:16.930 --> 00:02:21.860
 available to put these stickers 

00:02:18.490 --> 00:02:23.330
 are made of aluminum 

00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:26.150
 good 

00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:27.650
 Well, if we want to decorate them a little 

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:29.720
 good to differentiate in this case if 

00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:31.730
 We set up a slide to differentiate which is the 

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:34.640
 first of the second well are options 

00:02:31.730 --> 00:02:35.060
 well it never hurts this kind of 

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:36.830
 things 

00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:38.870
 Now let's go and get what's coming 

00:02:36.830 --> 00:02:41.440
 being the graphic card 

00:02:38.870 --> 00:02:44.200
 we are the packaging first 

00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:47.230
 comes with its anti static plastic 

00:02:44.200 --> 00:02:49.319
 so that it does not suffer any problem and 

00:02:47.230 --> 00:02:50.999
 I agreed 

00:02:49.319 --> 00:02:52.600
 we cleared a little what is the area of 

00:02:50.999 --> 00:02:56.580
 work 

00:02:52.600 --> 00:02:56.580
 and we are going to take out the bag 

00:02:57.770 --> 00:03:01.730
 as we are saying one of the 

00:02:59.510 --> 00:03:02.810
 main features of the asus 

00:03:01.730 --> 00:03:04.940
 is the direct 2 

00:03:02.810 --> 00:03:07.310
 this gives these jupiters their tubes 

00:03:04.940 --> 00:03:09.050
 of in this case 100 millimeters that what 

00:03:07.310 --> 00:03:11.480
 they have is a direct contact with the 

00:03:09.050 --> 00:03:13.319
 gpu with the core to improve what is 

00:03:11.480 --> 00:03:16.620
 the regeneration 

00:03:13.319 --> 00:03:18.780
 like other of its novelties is that 

00:03:16.620 --> 00:03:21.329
 come the fans with a design a 

00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:22.109
 new design for the theme of connections 

00:03:21.329 --> 00:03:24.780
 good 

00:03:22.109 --> 00:03:27.420
 the generic connections of nvidia the 

00:03:24.780 --> 00:03:29.790
 referenced swy the analog as 

00:03:27.420 --> 00:03:31.469
 digital your display by and its bump of me 

00:03:29.790 --> 00:03:33.060
 in the theme fans like 

00:03:31.469 --> 00:03:34.290
 we commented that you have with this design 

00:03:33.060 --> 00:03:36.870
 as you can see in the fan 

00:03:34.290 --> 00:03:39.120
 main is on top of the gpu that is 

00:03:36.870 --> 00:03:40.650
 a design let's say hybrid that what 

00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:44.120
 what it does is move the air in a way 

00:03:40.650 --> 00:03:46.319
 more erratic and what it does is improve 

00:03:44.120 --> 00:03:48.180
 supposedly the performance by 30% 

00:03:46.319 --> 00:03:50.189
 of refrigeration but increase in what 

00:03:48.180 --> 00:03:52.379
 that is what noise is like in 

00:03:50.189 --> 00:03:54.719
 this case that is has bet for two 

00:03:52.379 --> 00:03:56.519
 fans and here what we were commenting 

00:03:54.719 --> 00:03:58.709
 in these slots is where you were going to 

00:03:56.519 --> 00:04:00.449
 connect when you are going to place what 

00:03:58.709 --> 00:04:02.549
 are the stickers that we used to 

00:04:00.449 --> 00:04:05.260
 taught in the unboxing speed up red or 

00:04:02.549 --> 00:04:08.550
 golden 

00:04:05.260 --> 00:04:10.350
 pretty big fans 

00:04:08.550 --> 00:04:12.120
 the theme of the two fans that this 

00:04:10.350 --> 00:04:14.730
 it's good makes me reduce what is the 

00:04:12.120 --> 00:04:16.620
 noise Ziadeh the return of 

00:04:14.730 --> 00:04:18.390
 sound from the air fans to 

00:04:16.620 --> 00:04:20.549
 move through the dissipation that is 

00:04:18.390 --> 00:04:22.650
 what we are going to see next that 

00:04:20.549 --> 00:04:25.080
 well here you see what is all the 

00:04:22.650 --> 00:04:28.140
 block in this case we see here the 

00:04:25.080 --> 00:04:29.610
 let's say all the spike all the tubes 

00:04:28.140 --> 00:04:33.000
 of dissipation that have a contact 

00:04:29.610 --> 00:04:35.190
 direct come moderately polished to 

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:38.070
 a good contact and this will improve what 

00:04:35.190 --> 00:04:40.230
 that improving contact improves the 

00:04:38.070 --> 00:04:43.170
 heat transfer on the other hand what 

00:04:40.230 --> 00:04:45.810
 of the blues believe me if we see in the phases 

00:04:43.170 --> 00:04:47.760
 of feeding 

00:04:45.810 --> 00:04:49.710
 this new system which is the 

00:04:47.760 --> 00:04:51.840
 trainers in this case in Japanese 

00:04:49.710 --> 00:04:53.580
 they improve what is lowering what is the 

00:04:51.840 --> 00:04:55.680
 feed sound what is called 

00:04:53.580 --> 00:04:57.810
 electrical noise 

00:04:55.680 --> 00:04:59.820
 in this case the memory have been chosen 

00:04:57.810 --> 00:05:01.889
 for hynix that as we discussed in 

00:04:59.820 --> 00:05:04.110
 some news there have been certain 

00:05:01.889 --> 00:05:06.120
 problems with the rest of memories to the 

00:05:04.110 --> 00:05:07.800
 time to supply the market and good 

00:05:06.120 --> 00:05:12.780
 so far what is this preview 

00:05:07.800 --> 00:05:14.009
 of the gtx 780 direct2d of asus if 

00:05:12.780 --> 00:05:15.750
 you want to know more about this card 

00:05:14.009 --> 00:05:17.490
 soon we will have the review
