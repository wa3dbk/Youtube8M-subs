00:00:03.020 --> 00:00:06.930
 gas knob 

00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:08.550
 steering wheel and brake lever on this list 

00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:10.710
 governing bodies of the Russian 

00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:12.990
 ATV can finish 

00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:15.059
 the idea of ​​engineers is just to make 

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:17.130
 most reliable and easy to 

00:00:15.059 --> 00:00:20.180
 operating all-terrain vehicle frame design 

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:24.300
 usually metal house is obtained 

00:00:20.180 --> 00:00:26.369
 elementary cooked simply made post 

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:28.830
 retro starter has battery headlights 

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:30.869
 worth the gearbox here in principle 

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:33.210
 no instead automatic clutch 

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:35.579
 which transmits the moment through the circuit from 

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:38.370
 engine on wheels by the way motor here 

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:40.620
 unusual from the power tiller 6 

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:43.079
 half horsepower however this 

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:45.239
 quite enough to accelerate to 60 

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:47.850
 kilometers per hour and carry two adults 

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:49.469
 men ordinary garden tools in 

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:52.230
 skillful hands can turn into 

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:54.870
 full bike on this and fishing and 

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:57.050
 in the forest and just go for the sake of 

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:57.050
 adrenaline rush 

00:01:01.560 --> 00:01:06.100
 perhaps the main element in the design 

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:08.170
 ATV is its thick wheels 

00:01:06.100 --> 00:01:10.360
 because they perform two functions at once 

00:01:08.170 --> 00:01:12.520
 serve as propulsion and suspension 

00:01:10.360 --> 00:01:14.620
 simultaneously because of this the constructors 

00:01:12.520 --> 00:01:16.180
 even abandoned the shock absorbers in 

00:01:14.620 --> 00:01:18.160
 I basically need them because 

00:01:16.180 --> 00:01:18.790
 the pressure in the wheels is small all two 

00:01:18.160 --> 00:01:20.770
 the atmosphere 

00:01:18.790 --> 00:01:22.510
 the wheels are pretty big and they themselves 

00:01:20.770 --> 00:01:24.460
 by themselves already play the role of a shock absorber 

00:01:22.510 --> 00:01:26.680
 besides on the roads they do not give 

00:01:24.460 --> 00:01:28.810
 fail in snow or mud 

00:01:26.680 --> 00:01:31.390
 withstand cruising speed and not 

00:01:28.810 --> 00:01:33.729
 storm virgin lands deeper than 30 centimeters 

00:01:31.390 --> 00:01:36.130
 otherwise you have to pull the chieftain 

00:01:33.729 --> 00:01:38.710
 manually the benefit that it weighs a little 

00:01:36.130 --> 00:01:40.420
 about sixty kilograms but if 

00:01:38.710 --> 00:01:42.610
 dragging is not part of your plans 

00:01:40.420 --> 00:01:45.729
 you can transfer to another Russian 

00:01:42.610 --> 00:01:47.970
 all-terrain vehicle so-called moto dog he 

00:01:45.729 --> 00:01:51.280
 a little warm up his summer sonic 

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:54.040
 mania building can be clear hookahs that is 

00:01:51.280 --> 00:01:56.080
 in the same position as the motor 

00:01:54.040 --> 00:01:58.330
 moto rover but completely different 

00:01:56.080 --> 00:01:59.830
 principle of movement from the side 

00:01:58.330 --> 00:02:01.630
 reminds dog sledding 

00:01:59.830 --> 00:02:04.240
 only without animals 

00:02:01.630 --> 00:02:06.280
 control and patency match as 

00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:08.679
 experts claim tracked vehicle with 

00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:11.260
 trailed plastic sled is capable 

00:02:08.679 --> 00:02:13.120
 drive through the snow of any depth came 

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:15.100
 on the dog that is, it can be seen from the snow 

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:18.100
 rooftops only 

00:02:15.100 --> 00:02:20.500
 that is, it is more than two meters deep 

00:02:18.100 --> 00:02:22.180
 cover perhaps the only minus two 

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:23.890
 Russian SUVs in that 

00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:25.510
 you can ride with the wind 

00:02:23.890 --> 00:02:27.610
 only in the forest or field 

00:02:25.510 --> 00:02:29.050
 drive on public roads for 

00:02:27.610 --> 00:02:31.770
 driving such a vehicle 

00:02:29.050 --> 00:02:31.770
 prohibited
