00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:34.130 
step further and go for the elixir
inside<00:01:32.340> of<00:01:32.490> his<00:01:32.610> base<00:01:32.790> but<00:01:33.210> I<00:01:33.450> kind<00:01:33.840> of<00:01:33.900> did<00:01:34.110> it

inside of his base but I kind of did it

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:35.840 
inside of his base but I kind of did it
in<00:01:34.320> the<00:01:34.439> end<00:01:34.619> and<00:01:34.920> I'm<00:01:34.979> kind<00:01:35.220> of<00:01:35.280> sad<00:01:35.490> that<00:01:35.700> I

sometimes happens you know when you're

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:49.399 
sometimes happens you know when you're
farming<00:01:48.240> your<00:01:48.570> heroes<00:01:48.840> are<00:01:48.899> going<00:01:49.049> to<00:01:49.110> be<00:01:49.170> dead

farming your heroes are going to be dead
and<00:01:49.590> you're<00:01:49.710> gonna<00:01:49.799> run<00:01:49.920> into<00:01:49.979> these<00:01:50.250> types<00:01:50.549> of

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:50.640 
and you're gonna run into these types of

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:51.770 
and you're gonna run into these types of
bases<00:01:51.030> you're<00:01:51.149> going<00:01:51.270> to<00:01:51.329> write<00:01:51.420> on<00:01:51.570> but<00:01:51.689> your

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:51.780 
bases you're going to write on but your

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:53.030 
bases you're going to write on but your
doctor<00:01:51.990> every<00:01:52.200> resource<00:01:52.530> because<00:01:52.770> you<00:01:52.890> don't

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:53.040 
doctor every resource because you don't

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:55.179 
doctor every resource because you don't
have<00:01:53.189> all<00:01:53.850> your<00:01:53.880> troops<00:01:54.329> at<00:01:54.479> your<00:01:54.600> disposal

have all your troops at your disposal

00:01:55.189 --> 00:01:57.709 
have all your troops at your disposal
but<00:01:56.189> with<00:01:56.430> that<00:01:56.759> I'm<00:01:57.270> going<00:01:57.360> to<00:01:57.420> speed<00:01:57.570> up<00:01:57.689> the

00:01:57.709 --> 00:01:57.719 
but with that I'm going to speed up the

00:01:57.719 --> 00:01:58.819 
but with that I'm going to speed up the
right<00:01:57.990> here<00:01:58.170> a<00:01:58.200> little<00:01:58.320> bit<00:01:58.439> for<00:01:58.590> you<00:01:58.649> guys

00:02:00.109 --> 00:02:00.119 
because it gets kind of boring to the

00:02:00.119 --> 00:02:02.120 
because it gets kind of boring to the
end<00:02:00.329> but<00:02:00.960> this<00:02:01.140> is<00:02:01.290> just<00:02:01.320> a<00:02:01.560> basic<00:02:01.680> the<00:02:01.979> base

00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:02.130 
end but this is just a basic the base

you see we got a lot of resources plus
the<00:02:12.300> loop<00:02:12.510> bone

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:12.880 
the loop bone

00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:15.690 
the loop bone
made<00:02:13.360> it<00:02:13.450> even<00:02:13.600> all<00:02:13.990> that<00:02:14.260> better<00:02:14.680> so<00:02:15.340> for<00:02:15.610> this

00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:18.360 
made it even all that better so for this
next<00:02:15.760> raid<00:02:16.330> I<00:02:16.660> you<00:02:17.410> know<00:02:17.440> I<00:02:17.530> didn't<00:02:17.890> expect<00:02:18.220> to

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:18.370 
next raid I you know I didn't expect to

00:02:18.370 --> 00:02:20.460 
next raid I you know I didn't expect to
get<00:02:18.670> a<00:02:18.880> really<00:02:19.480> really<00:02:19.720> high<00:02:19.900> percentage<00:02:20.380> on

00:02:20.460 --> 00:02:20.470 
get a really really high percentage on

00:02:20.470 --> 00:02:22.200 
get a really really high percentage on
this<00:02:20.620> base<00:02:20.800> as<00:02:21.040> you<00:02:21.130> see<00:02:21.280> here<00:02:21.520> all<00:02:22.030> his

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:22.210 
this base as you see here all his

00:02:22.210 --> 00:02:24.330 
this base as you see here all his
collectors<00:02:22.750> and<00:02:23.080> all<00:02:23.470> his<00:02:23.560> mines<00:02:23.800> were<00:02:23.980> inside

00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:24.340 
collectors and all his mines were inside

00:02:24.340 --> 00:02:26.160 
collectors and all his mines were inside
the<00:02:24.370> base<00:02:24.730> but<00:02:25.000> this<00:02:25.120> was<00:02:25.300> also<00:02:25.480> an<00:02:25.720> abandoned

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:26.170 
the base but this was also an abandoned

00:02:26.170 --> 00:02:28.470 
the base but this was also an abandoned
base<00:02:26.260> at<00:02:26.440> the<00:02:26.530> same<00:02:26.740> time<00:02:27.130> so<00:02:27.850> I<00:02:27.880> was<00:02:28.240> kind<00:02:28.360> of

00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:28.480 
base at the same time so I was kind of

00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:29.760 
base at the same time so I was kind of
thinking<00:02:28.570> you<00:02:28.870> know<00:02:29.020> I<00:02:29.050> want<00:02:29.350> to<00:02:29.380> get<00:02:29.530> in<00:02:29.620> there

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:29.770 
thinking you know I want to get in there

00:02:29.770 --> 00:02:31.230 
thinking you know I want to get in there
I<00:02:29.800> want<00:02:30.010> to<00:02:30.070> take<00:02:30.190> those<00:02:30.340> resources<00:02:30.700> it<00:02:31.090> was<00:02:31.180> a

00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:31.240 
I want to take those resources it was a

00:02:31.240 --> 00:02:33.090 
I want to take those resources it was a
perfect<00:02:31.480> grade<00:02:31.870> to<00:02:32.050> do<00:02:32.200> in<00:02:32.440> all<00:02:32.590> honesty

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:33.100 
perfect grade to do in all honesty

00:02:33.100 --> 00:02:35.160 
perfect grade to do in all honesty
because<00:02:33.250> you<00:02:33.850> don't<00:02:34.030> run<00:02:34.180> across<00:02:34.480> these<00:02:34.660> bases

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:35.170 
because you don't run across these bases

00:02:35.170 --> 00:02:37.950 
because you don't run across these bases
very<00:02:35.440> often<00:02:35.950> and<00:02:36.190> I'm<00:02:37.180> guessing<00:02:37.660> with<00:02:37.780> the<00:02:37.870> new

00:02:37.950 --> 00:02:37.960 
very often and I'm guessing with the new

00:02:37.960 --> 00:02:39.780 
very often and I'm guessing with the new
update<00:02:37.990> that<00:02:38.560> looks<00:02:38.710> going<00:02:38.890> to<00:02:38.950> improve<00:02:39.400> I

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:39.790 
update that looks going to improve I

00:02:39.790 --> 00:02:42.210 
update that looks going to improve I
guess<00:02:40.270> in<00:02:40.390> the<00:02:40.990> new<00:02:41.110> update<00:02:41.320> is<00:02:41.530> going<00:02:42.040> to<00:02:42.130> be

00:02:42.210 --> 00:02:42.220 
guess in the new update is going to be

00:02:42.220 --> 00:02:44.670 
guess in the new update is going to be
