dog<00:01:37.259> knows<00:01:37.500> it<00:01:37.710> that's<00:01:38.070> it<00:01:38.310> over<00:01:38.460> the<00:01:38.820> jump

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:39.030 
dog knows it that's it over the jump

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:40.910 
dog knows it that's it over the jump
command<00:01:39.390> it<00:01:39.600> works<00:01:39.900> as<00:01:40.409> long<00:01:40.439> as<00:01:40.680> they're<00:01:40.799> real

00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:40.920 
command it works as long as they're real

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:42.350 
command it works as long as they're real
consistent<00:01:41.340> they<00:01:41.400> won<00:01:41.549> I<00:01:41.729> want<00:01:41.939> to<00:01:41.970> also<00:01:42.090> make

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:42.360 
consistent they won I want to also make

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:44.210 
consistent they won I want to also make
sure<00:01:42.479> they<00:01:42.720> use<00:01:42.899> the<00:01:43.049> same<00:01:43.079> word<00:01:43.619> over<00:01:43.920> and

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:44.220 
sure they use the same word over and

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:45.859 
sure they use the same word over and
over<00:01:44.369> again<00:01:44.579> whether<00:01:44.820> it's<00:01:45.000> jump<00:01:45.240> or<00:01:45.479> hot<00:01:45.659> or

00:01:45.859 --> 00:01:45.869 
over again whether it's jump or hot or

00:01:45.869 --> 00:01:47.569 
over again whether it's jump or hot or
whatever<00:01:46.140> it<00:01:46.229> is<00:01:46.290> right<00:01:46.500> right<00:01:46.799> now<00:01:46.860> the

00:01:47.569 --> 00:01:47.579 
whatever it is right right now the

00:01:47.579 --> 00:01:48.830 
whatever it is right right now the
height<00:01:47.820> then<00:01:48.030> looking<00:01:48.240> at<00:01:48.360> the<00:01:48.420> height<00:01:48.570> here

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:48.840 
height then looking at the height here

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:50.690 
height then looking at the height here
how<00:01:49.560> do<00:01:49.619> we<00:01:49.740> determine<00:01:49.890> the<00:01:50.250> height<00:01:50.399> of<00:01:50.460> the

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:50.700 
how do we determine the height of the

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:53.240 
how do we determine the height of the
jump<00:01:51.110> what<00:01:52.110> you<00:01:52.229> do<00:01:52.350> is<00:01:52.500> you<00:01:52.619> have<00:01:52.649> you<00:01:53.009> measure

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:53.250 
jump what you do is you have you measure

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:55.609 
jump what you do is you have you measure
your<00:01:53.520> dog<00:01:53.790> at<00:01:54.119> the<00:01:54.600> top<00:01:54.810> of<00:01:54.840> their<00:01:55.020> withers<00:01:55.380> and

00:01:55.609 --> 00:01:55.619 
your dog at the top of their withers and

00:01:55.619 --> 00:01:57.620 
your dog at the top of their withers and
the<00:01:55.680> withers<00:01:56.130> are<00:01:56.460> the<00:01:56.759> top<00:01:56.969> of<00:01:57.149> the<00:01:57.240> shoulder

00:01:57.620 --> 00:01:57.630 
the withers are the top of the shoulder

00:01:57.630 --> 00:02:00.410 
the withers are the top of the shoulder
blades<00:01:57.869> so<00:01:58.619> this<00:01:58.799> dog<00:01:58.979> is<00:01:59.040> about<00:01:59.430> 23<00:01:59.969> inches<00:02:00.270> at

00:02:00.410 --> 00:02:00.420 
blades so this dog is about 23 inches at

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:02.840 
blades so this dog is about 23 inches at
the<00:02:00.450> withers<00:02:00.570> and<00:02:01.110> his<00:02:01.710> jump<00:02:02.070> height<00:02:02.280> is<00:02:02.520> 24

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:02.850 
the withers and his jump height is 24

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:05.630 
the withers and his jump height is 24
inches<00:02:03.299> in<00:02:03.719> competition<00:02:04.469> now<00:02:05.070> we<00:02:05.130> don't<00:02:05.310> start

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:05.640 
inches in competition now we don't start

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:07.520 
inches in competition now we don't start
him<00:02:05.790> at<00:02:05.909> 24<00:02:06.390> inches<00:02:06.750> we<00:02:06.930> have<00:02:07.049> to<00:02:07.200> start<00:02:07.409> him

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:07.530 
him at 24 inches we have to start him

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:10.460 
him at 24 inches we have to start him
lower<00:02:08.069> at<00:02:08.340> 12<00:02:08.729> and<00:02:09.539> as<00:02:09.690> he<00:02:09.869> gets<00:02:10.020> a<00:02:10.140> little<00:02:10.229> bit

00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:10.470 
lower at 12 and as he gets a little bit

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:12.470 
lower at 12 and as he gets a little bit
better<00:02:10.679> and<00:02:11.099> more<00:02:11.459> confident<00:02:11.970> then<00:02:12.180> we'll<00:02:12.330> go

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:12.480 
better and more confident then we'll go

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:13.200 
better and more confident then we'll go
ahead<00:02:12.599> and<00:02:12.780> we'll<00:02:12.930> ray

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:13.210 
ahead and we'll ray

00:02:13.210 --> 00:02:14.430 
ahead and we'll ray
come<00:02:13.360> up<00:02:13.480> and<00:02:13.630> maybe<00:02:13.810> four<00:02:14.140> inch<00:02:14.290> increments

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:14.440 
come up and maybe four inch increments

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:16.590 
come up and maybe four inch increments
over<00:02:14.950> a<00:02:15.130> matter<00:02:15.370> of<00:02:15.460> weeks<00:02:15.730> how<00:02:16.210> long<00:02:16.390> have<00:02:16.570> you

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:16.600 
over a matter of weeks how long have you

00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:18.390 
over a matter of weeks how long have you
been<00:02:16.690> working<00:02:17.080> with<00:02:17.350> this<00:02:17.500> dog<00:02:17.650> on<00:02:17.980> these<00:02:18.160> on

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:18.400 
been working with this dog on these on

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:21.330 
been working with this dog on these on
these<00:02:18.430> jumps<00:02:18.790> here<00:02:18.970> he's<00:02:19.540> been<00:02:19.780> doing<00:02:20.340> the

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:21.340 
these jumps here he's been doing the

00:02:21.340 --> 00:02:23.880 
these jumps here he's been doing the
jumping<00:02:21.820> for<00:02:22.330> a<00:02:22.390> few<00:02:22.570> weeks<00:02:22.720> right<00:02:23.200> you<00:02:23.740> know

00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:23.890 
jumping for a few weeks right you know

00:02:23.890 --> 00:02:25.920 
jumping for a few weeks right you know
so<00:02:24.190> what's<00:02:24.430> next<00:02:24.550> um<00:02:25.330> we're<00:02:25.630> going<00:02:25.750> to<00:02:25.810> go

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:25.930 
so what's next um we're going to go

00:02:25.930 --> 00:02:26.880 
so what's next um we're going to go
ahead<00:02:26.020> and<00:02:26.170> we're<00:02:26.320> going<00:02:26.350> to<00:02:26.500> see<00:02:26.650> the<00:02:26.740> broad

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:26.890 
ahead and we're going to see the broad

00:02:26.890 --> 00:02:28.800 
ahead and we're going to see the broad
jump<00:02:27.160> great<00:02:27.550> obviously<00:02:28.360> this<00:02:28.450> is<00:02:28.600> different

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:28.810 
jump great obviously this is different

00:02:28.810 --> 00:02:30.180 
jump great obviously this is different
looking<00:02:29.140> than<00:02:29.290> the<00:02:29.380> other<00:02:29.530> jump<00:02:29.830> this<00:02:30.010> has<00:02:30.160> a

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:30.190 
looking than the other jump this has a

00:02:30.190 --> 00:02:32.010 
looking than the other jump this has a
lot<00:02:30.340> more<00:02:30.400> length<00:02:30.850> to<00:02:31.120> it<00:02:31.150> it's<00:02:31.450> not<00:02:31.630> quite<00:02:31.870> as

00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:32.020 
lot more length to it it's not quite as

00:02:32.020 --> 00:02:34.530 
lot more length to it it's not quite as
high<00:02:32.230> right<00:02:32.920> it's<00:02:33.190> a<00:02:33.370> lot<00:02:33.580> lower<00:02:34.300> to<00:02:34.480> the

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:34.540 
high right it's a lot lower to the

00:02:34.540 --> 00:02:36.720 
high right it's a lot lower to the
ground<00:02:34.600> and<00:02:35.020> longer<00:02:35.800> it<00:02:35.890> requires<00:02:36.190> the<00:02:36.370> dog<00:02:36.550> to

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:36.730 
ground and longer it requires the dog to

00:02:36.730 --> 00:02:39.060 
ground and longer it requires the dog to
jump<00:02:36.940> a<00:02:37.090> big<00:02:37.270> wider<00:02:37.780> span<00:02:38.350> how<00:02:38.890> do<00:02:38.950> you

00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:39.070 
jump a big wider span how do you

00:02:39.070 --> 00:02:42.300 
jump a big wider span how do you
determine<00:02:39.250> the<00:02:39.460> the<00:02:40.330> length<00:02:40.770> if<00:02:41.770> this<00:02:42.040> dog

00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:42.310 
determine the the length if this dog

00:02:42.310 --> 00:02:44.880 
determine the the length if this dog
will<00:02:42.550> say<00:02:42.730> jump<00:02:42.970> 20<00:02:43.330> inches<00:02:43.750> you<00:02:44.380> would<00:02:44.530> double

00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:44.890 
will say jump 20 inches you would double

00:02:44.890 --> 00:02:46.740 
will say jump 20 inches you would double
that<00:02:45.070> jump<00:02:45.370> height<00:02:45.550> and<00:02:45.820> so<00:02:46.420> what<00:02:46.600> we've<00:02:46.720> got

00:02:46.740 --> 00:02:46.750 
that jump height and so what we've got

00:02:46.750 --> 00:02:48.720 
that jump height and so what we've got
is<00:02:46.990> we've<00:02:47.200> got<00:02:47.530> him<00:02:47.680> jumping<00:02:48.010> about<00:02:48.220> 40<00:02:48.700> inches

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:48.730 
is we've got him jumping about 40 inches

00:02:48.730 --> 00:02:51.390 
is we've got him jumping about 40 inches
so<00:02:49.720> basically<00:02:50.170> if<00:02:50.350> a<00:02:50.440> jog<00:02:50.650> is<00:02:50.830> jumping<00:02:51.220> 20

00:02:51.390 --> 00:02:51.400 
so basically if a jog is jumping 20

00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:53.580 
so basically if a jog is jumping 20
inches<00:02:51.850> high<00:02:52.300> then<00:02:53.050> the<00:02:53.200> length<00:02:53.380> would<00:02:53.530> be

00:02:53.580 --> 00:02:53.590 
inches high then the length would be

00:02:53.590 --> 00:02:56.340 
inches high then the length would be
double<00:02:54.190> before<00:02:54.670> 40<00:02:54.970> inches<00:02:55.150> right<00:02:55.480> here<00:02:56.200> we

00:02:56.340 --> 00:02:56.350 
double before 40 inches right here we

00:02:56.350 --> 00:02:58.410 
double before 40 inches right here we
have<00:02:56.470> Barbara<00:02:57.010> and<00:02:57.250> she's<00:02:57.520> brought<00:02:57.730> out<00:02:57.940> turbo

00:02:58.410 --> 00:02:58.420 
have Barbara and she's brought out turbo

00:02:58.420 --> 00:03:00.660 
have Barbara and she's brought out turbo

00:03:08.310 --> 00:03:11.670 
see how you go about training it okay
what<00:03:09.310> I<00:03:09.340> would<00:03:09.640> probably<00:03:09.760> do<00:03:10.360> if<00:03:10.660> if<00:03:11.200> we<00:03:11.500> had

00:03:11.670 --> 00:03:11.680 
what I would probably do if if we had

00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:13.260 
what I would probably do if if we had
this<00:03:11.830> target<00:03:12.220> class<00:03:12.460> and<00:03:12.700> he'd<00:03:12.790> never<00:03:12.970> done

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:13.270 
this target class and he'd never done

00:03:13.270 --> 00:03:15.240 
this target class and he'd never done
before<00:03:13.480> would<00:03:14.380> be<00:03:14.500> to<00:03:14.590> pull<00:03:14.800> a<00:03:14.830> couple<00:03:15.040> of

00:03:15.240 --> 00:03:15.250 
before would be to pull a couple of

00:03:15.250 --> 00:03:17.580 
before would be to pull a couple of
these<00:03:15.370> boards<00:03:15.610> away<00:03:15.940> okay<00:03:16.690> and<00:03:16.900> then<00:03:17.230> go<00:03:17.560> ahead

00:03:17.580 --> 00:03:17.590 
these boards away okay and then go ahead

00:03:17.590 --> 00:03:20.960 
these boards away okay and then go ahead
and<00:03:17.800> all<00:03:17.920> I<00:03:17.950> ask<00:03:18.100> barber<00:03:18.490> to<00:03:18.580> jump<00:03:18.820> that<00:03:19.030> jump

00:03:20.960 --> 00:03:20.970 
and all I ask barber to jump that jump

00:03:20.970 --> 00:03:24.930 
and all I ask barber to jump that jump
and<00:03:21.970> just<00:03:22.210> using<00:03:22.480> a<00:03:22.600> over<00:03:23.410> command<00:03:23.790> and<00:03:24.790> then

00:03:24.930 --> 00:03:24.940 
and just using a over command and then

00:03:24.940 --> 00:03:27.090 
and just using a over command and then
if<00:03:25.330> he<00:03:25.570> can<00:03:25.780> do<00:03:25.960> it<00:03:26.170> and<00:03:26.380> he's<00:03:26.530> not<00:03:26.710> having<00:03:26.950> any

00:03:27.090 --> 00:03:27.100 
if he can do it and he's not having any

00:03:27.100 --> 00:03:28.890 
if he can do it and he's not having any
problems<00:03:27.490> I'll<00:03:27.640> maybe<00:03:27.820> add<00:03:28.030> one<00:03:28.300> board<00:03:28.570> still

00:03:28.890 --> 00:03:28.900 
problems I'll maybe add one board still

00:03:28.900 --> 00:03:32.240 
problems I'll maybe add one board still
on<00:03:29.080> its<00:03:29.260> edge<00:03:29.940> should<00:03:30.940> bring<00:03:31.210> his<00:03:31.360> back<00:03:31.630> over

00:03:32.240 --> 00:03:32.250 
on its edge should bring his back over

00:03:32.250 --> 00:03:35.070 
on its edge should bring his back over
good<00:03:33.250> boy<00:03:33.610> and<00:03:33.970> she's<00:03:34.270> just<00:03:34.480> using<00:03:34.660> the<00:03:34.930> leash

00:03:35.070 --> 00:03:35.080 
good boy and she's just using the leash

00:03:35.080 --> 00:03:36.540 
good boy and she's just using the leash
to<00:03:35.320> guide<00:03:35.500> him<00:03:35.680> and<00:03:35.800> keep<00:03:35.920> him<00:03:36.100> in<00:03:36.190> the<00:03:36.340> middle

00:03:36.540 --> 00:03:36.550 
to guide him and keep him in the middle

00:03:36.550 --> 00:03:38.070 
to guide him and keep him in the middle
and<00:03:36.850> again<00:03:37.090> she's<00:03:37.270> saying<00:03:37.450> the<00:03:37.570> same<00:03:37.750> word

00:03:38.070 --> 00:03:38.080 
and again she's saying the same word

00:03:38.080 --> 00:03:40.200 
and again she's saying the same word
that<00:03:38.350> she<00:03:38.500> said<00:03:38.710> before<00:03:39.070> again<00:03:39.550> you<00:03:39.910> know<00:03:40.030> just

00:03:40.200 --> 00:03:40.210 
that she said before again you know just

00:03:40.210 --> 00:03:41.400 
that she said before again you know just
keep<00:03:40.300> things<00:03:40.480> real<00:03:40.630> consistent<00:03:41.080> right<00:03:41.200> with

00:03:41.400 --> 00:03:41.410 
keep things real consistent right with

00:03:41.410 --> 00:03:43.650 
keep things real consistent right with
right<00:03:41.620> with<00:03:41.920> the<00:03:42.010> other<00:03:42.130> jumps<00:03:42.430> right<00:03:42.760> and<00:03:43.540> one

00:03:43.650 --> 00:03:43.660 
right with the other jumps right and one

00:03:43.660 --> 00:03:46.830 
right with the other jumps right and one
more<00:03:43.810> time<00:03:43.840> over<00:03:44.910> okay<00:03:45.910> now<00:03:46.210> since<00:03:46.480> he's<00:03:46.690> not

00:03:46.830 --> 00:03:46.840 
more time over okay now since he's not

00:03:46.840 --> 00:03:49.200 
more time over okay now since he's not
having<00:03:47.200> any<00:03:47.350> problems<00:03:47.920> what<00:03:48.520> I'll<00:03:48.640> do<00:03:48.850> is<00:03:48.880> a

00:03:49.200 --> 00:03:49.210 
having any problems what I'll do is a

00:03:49.210 --> 00:03:52.680 
having any problems what I'll do is a
will<00:03:49.420> put<00:03:49.990> the<00:03:50.110> two<00:03:50.350> middle<00:03:50.620> ones<00:03:50.850> flat<00:03:51.850> what

00:03:52.680 --> 00:03:52.690 
will put the two middle ones flat what

00:03:52.690 --> 00:03:54.240 
will put the two middle ones flat what
we're<00:03:52.840> doing<00:03:53.140> is<00:03:53.230> just<00:03:53.290> building<00:03:53.680> the<00:03:53.890> jump

00:03:54.240 --> 00:03:54.250 
we're doing is just building the jump

00:03:54.250 --> 00:03:57.390 
we're doing is just building the jump
underneath<00:03:55.240> the<00:03:55.870> non<00:03:56.050> wing<00:03:56.320> jump<00:03:56.650> we're<00:03:57.220> using

00:03:57.390 --> 00:03:57.400 
underneath the non wing jump we're using

00:03:57.400 --> 00:03:59.790 
underneath the non wing jump we're using
the<00:03:57.550> pole<00:03:57.880> to<00:03:58.150> provide<00:03:58.630> some<00:03:58.870> height<00:03:59.110> while

00:03:59.790 --> 00:03:59.800 
the pole to provide some height while

00:03:59.800 --> 00:04:01.320 
the pole to provide some height while
he's<00:03:59.950> getting<00:04:00.160> used<00:04:00.460> to<00:04:00.670> looking<00:04:01.000> at<00:04:01.150> the

00:04:01.320 --> 00:04:01.330 
he's getting used to looking at the

00:04:01.330 --> 00:04:05.820 
he's getting used to looking at the
flatter<00:04:01.630> jump<00:04:02.020> below<00:04:02.320> it<00:04:02.530> okay<00:04:03.460> over<00:04:04.320> okay<00:04:05.320> so

00:04:05.820 --> 00:04:05.830 
flatter jump below it okay over okay so

00:04:05.830 --> 00:04:07.110 
flatter jump below it okay over okay so
the<00:04:05.950> viewers<00:04:06.190> can<00:04:06.310> kind<00:04:06.460> of<00:04:06.490> understand<00:04:06.940> here

00:04:07.110 --> 00:04:07.120 
the viewers can kind of understand here

00:04:07.120 --> 00:04:08.700 
the viewers can kind of understand here
you<00:04:07.570> know<00:04:07.660> we're<00:04:08.230> kind<00:04:08.380> of<00:04:08.500> you<00:04:08.650> know

00:04:08.700 --> 00:04:08.710 
you know we're kind of you know

00:04:08.710 --> 00:04:10.380 
you know we're kind of you know
progressing<00:04:09.190> a<00:04:09.250> little<00:04:09.430> bit<00:04:09.520> what<00:04:10.030> time<00:04:10.210> what

00:04:10.380 --> 00:04:10.390 
progressing a little bit what time what

00:04:10.390 --> 00:04:11.700 
progressing a little bit what time what
time<00:04:10.420> frame<00:04:10.780> we<00:04:10.930> were<00:04:11.020> looking<00:04:11.290> at<00:04:11.380> here<00:04:11.530> you

00:04:11.700 --> 00:04:11.710 
time frame we were looking at here you

00:04:11.710 --> 00:04:13.800 
time frame we were looking at here you
know<00:04:11.800> from<00:04:11.920> going<00:04:12.160> from<00:04:12.310> where<00:04:12.610> we<00:04:12.730> began<00:04:12.970> to

00:04:13.800 --> 00:04:13.810 
know from going from where we began to

00:04:13.810 --> 00:04:15.840 
know from going from where we began to
like<00:04:13.960> where<00:04:14.140> we<00:04:14.260> are<00:04:14.290> right<00:04:14.410> now<00:04:14.560> it<00:04:15.340> can<00:04:15.550> it

00:04:15.840 --> 00:04:15.850 
like where we are right now it can it

00:04:15.850 --> 00:04:17.520 
like where we are right now it can it
can<00:04:15.880> go<00:04:16.180> pretty<00:04:16.390> quickly<00:04:16.780> you<00:04:16.960> just<00:04:17.260> have<00:04:17.410> to

00:04:17.520 --> 00:04:17.530 
can go pretty quickly you just have to

00:04:17.530 --> 00:04:19.380 
can go pretty quickly you just have to
judge<00:04:17.770> and<00:04:18.130> see<00:04:18.370> how<00:04:18.520> the<00:04:18.580> dog<00:04:18.850> is<00:04:19.060> doing<00:04:19.210> if

00:04:19.380 --> 00:04:19.390 
judge and see how the dog is doing if

00:04:19.390 --> 00:04:21.840 
judge and see how the dog is doing if
the<00:04:19.510> dog<00:04:19.690> is<00:04:19.720> progressing<00:04:20.560> and<00:04:20.710> not<00:04:21.340> walking

00:04:21.840 --> 00:04:21.850 
the dog is progressing and not walking

00:04:21.850 --> 00:04:24.150 
the dog is progressing and not walking
on<00:04:21.970> the<00:04:22.090> boards<00:04:22.540> then<00:04:23.140> you<00:04:23.320> can<00:04:23.530> just<00:04:23.710> work<00:04:23.980> at

00:04:24.150 --> 00:04:24.160 
on the boards then you can just work at

00:04:24.160 --> 00:04:26.220 
on the boards then you can just work at
this<00:04:24.340> pace<00:04:24.669> but<00:04:25.090> as<00:04:25.240> soon<00:04:25.390> as<00:04:25.510> they<00:04:25.690> start<00:04:26.050> to

00:04:26.220 --> 00:04:26.230 
this pace but as soon as they start to

00:04:26.230 --> 00:04:26.970 
this pace but as soon as they start to
act<00:04:26.350> confused

00:04:26.970 --> 00:04:26.980 
act confused

00:04:26.980 --> 00:04:29.130 
act confused
or<00:04:27.280> step<00:04:27.610> on<00:04:27.760> the<00:04:27.910> boards<00:04:28.210> then<00:04:28.720> you<00:04:28.840> have<00:04:28.990> to

00:04:29.130 --> 00:04:29.140 
or step on the boards then you have to

00:04:29.140 --> 00:04:31.230 
or step on the boards then you have to
back<00:04:29.350> up<00:04:29.380> a<00:04:29.710> little<00:04:29.830> bit<00:04:30.070> and<00:04:30.280> just<00:04:30.430> regress<00:04:31.210> a

00:04:31.230 --> 00:04:31.240 
back up a little bit and just regress a

00:04:31.240 --> 00:04:32.610 
back up a little bit and just regress a
little<00:04:31.510> yeah<00:04:31.720> now<00:04:31.960> this<00:04:32.080> is<00:04:32.260> something<00:04:32.440> that

00:04:32.610 --> 00:04:32.620 
little yeah now this is something that

00:04:32.620 --> 00:04:34.410 
little yeah now this is something that
any<00:04:32.830> of<00:04:33.040> us<00:04:33.100> should<00:04:33.250> be<00:04:33.400> able<00:04:33.490> to<00:04:33.670> do<00:04:33.790> with<00:04:34.390> a

00:04:34.410 --> 00:04:34.420 
any of us should be able to do with a

00:04:34.420 --> 00:04:35.940 
any of us should be able to do with a
lot<00:04:34.690> of<00:04:34.810> training<00:04:35.080> and<00:04:35.350> a<00:04:35.500> little<00:04:35.800> bit<00:04:35.890> of

00:04:35.940 --> 00:04:35.950 
lot of training and a little bit of

00:04:35.950 --> 00:04:37.710 
lot of training and a little bit of
patience<00:04:36.400> this<00:04:36.760> should<00:04:36.910> be<00:04:37.000> a<00:04:37.030> lot<00:04:37.240> of<00:04:37.270> fun<00:04:37.390> for

00:04:37.710 --> 00:04:37.720 
patience this should be a lot of fun for

00:04:37.720 --> 00:04:41.160 
patience this should be a lot of fun for
both<00:04:37.810> owners<00:04:38.110> and<00:04:38.560> their<00:04:38.950> dogs
