00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.259
 good friends today we are going to learn two 

00:00:01.709 --> 00:00:07.620
 chords instead of one are very similar 

00:00:04.259 --> 00:00:10.670
 they will be bigger and smaller than they have 

00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:13.220
 this form re minor 

00:00:10.670 --> 00:00:15.680
 and re major as I told you before 

00:00:13.220 --> 00:00:17.990
 the chords with the same name do not 

00:00:15.680 --> 00:00:20.480
 they combine well that is to say we 're never going to 

00:00:17.990 --> 00:00:22.340
 Use together D minor and D major in a 

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:24.170
 song is worth or it's going to be very strange that 

00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:25.849
 let's use together but they are so similar 

00:00:24.170 --> 00:00:26.540
 each other that we are going to learn the 

00:00:25.849 --> 00:00:28.279
 two pull 

00:00:26.540 --> 00:00:29.900
 then to get to this network what 

00:00:28.279 --> 00:00:31.910
 we are going to do is going to be come as 

00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:33.140
 we said in the previous chord from the 

00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:35.210
 less 

00:00:33.140 --> 00:00:36.890
 with that and in the minor if you do not remember 

00:00:35.210 --> 00:00:38.780
 of how you put the least good then 

00:00:36.890 --> 00:00:41.300
 review the first lessons the 

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:44.120
 you have well ordered in the blog I leave you 

00:00:41.300 --> 00:00:46.610
 the link in the description but good 

00:00:44.120 --> 00:00:49.640
 it's something a quick review we put the 

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:54.350
 first chord is easier my youngest 

00:00:49.640 --> 00:00:57.920
 we added this finger my biggest and we went down 

00:00:54.350 --> 00:01:00.140
 all a rope below the lowest 

00:00:57.920 --> 00:01:01.160
 ok here we will learn well that 

00:01:00.140 --> 00:01:05.710
 My minor way 

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:08.420
 my oldest the youngest and now from the youngest 

00:01:05.710 --> 00:01:12.380
 what we are going to do to get to this 

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:15.110
 network is to lower all other string below 

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:18.770
 that is to say we take the three fingers in 

00:01:15.110 --> 00:01:21.229
 block and we down one more rope 

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:22.970
 ok we have the same agreed but one 

00:01:21.229 --> 00:01:27.050
 rope below 

00:01:22.970 --> 00:01:29.270
 and this finger the number 3 finger what 

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:33.020
 let's do it's going to be bring you a fret 

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:34.850
 more forward is to say 

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:36.829
 and good though you see that I move 

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:39.140
 all is to open your fingers but 

00:01:36.829 --> 00:01:41.630
 really the 1 and the 2 are staying 

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:44.450
 in the same fret is the only one that 

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:46.759
 advance fret that number 3 finger as 

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:50.810
 you see is very similar to the one we come from 

00:01:46.759 --> 00:01:52.610
 we lower it and we advance this finger the thing 

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:54.170
 is that we put it like that and 

00:01:52.610 --> 00:01:55.590
 this we put with your fingers a little 

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:58.079
 more open but 

00:01:55.590 --> 00:02:00.359
 it's just finger progress and this nothing is 

00:01:58.079 --> 00:02:04.189
 out here then what we have left is 

00:02:00.359 --> 00:02:06.929
 the sixth and the fifth strings to the air 

00:02:04.189 --> 00:02:08.129
 but let's try not to touch them is 

00:02:06.929 --> 00:02:10.790
 say the king chord 

00:02:08.129 --> 00:02:15.060
 let's try to play from the fourth 

00:02:10.790 --> 00:02:18.330
 down is worth sixth and fifth air 

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:21.360
 without touching the fourth string in the air but 

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:24.420
 we do touch it if you remember 

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:27.120
 the first scale this rope to the air is 

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:29.220
 the network note as we are in the chord of 

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:31.920
 So we're going to touch it to the third 

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:35.670
 string on the number two fret with the 

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:37.740
 finger two second rope fret number 

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:40.200
 three with the third finger 

00:02:37.740 --> 00:02:42.300
 If you do not get the finger right 3 is worth the 

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:44.550
 people who have a small hand or 

00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:48.120
 children what they usually do is instead of 

00:02:44.550 --> 00:02:50.550
 finger 3 change for finger 4 but eye 

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:53.400
 in the third fret, come on, come on 

00:02:50.550 --> 00:02:55.770
 now one more fret this way in 

00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:59.130
 instead of using this d they use this as 

00:02:55.770 --> 00:03:02.160
 you want and the first string has to 

00:02:59.130 --> 00:03:03.790
 go under these two fingers without 

00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:06.790
 touch 

00:03:03.790 --> 00:03:10.739
 and we cover it with finger 1 on the fret 

00:03:06.790 --> 00:03:10.739
 1 then the reminder of re sounds like this 

00:03:11.630 --> 00:03:17.270
 in previous chords we said that if 

00:03:14.570 --> 00:03:19.280
 we play the strings the strings of more 

00:03:17.270 --> 00:03:21.920
 up , nothing happens, it's not going to sound bad 

00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:24.140
 in this case if we just play the string 

00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:26.480
 from above it will not sound bad but if 

00:03:24.140 --> 00:03:29.090
 we play the sixth string yes that is a 

00:03:26.480 --> 00:03:32.150
 note that you leave the chord is worth 

00:03:29.090 --> 00:03:33.770
 then nothing happens because you leave 

00:03:32.150 --> 00:03:34.880
 a little finger that is the fifth but 

00:03:33.770 --> 00:03:37.220
 which you do not have to touch in any 

00:03:34.880 --> 00:03:39.260
 case in the while you are doing the 

00:03:37.220 --> 00:03:40.850
 chord of re is the sixth good string 

00:03:39.260 --> 00:03:43.610
 we said that we were going to see two chords 

00:03:40.850 --> 00:03:45.500
 this would be the first of them that is 

00:03:43.610 --> 00:03:47.360
 minor and now let's see how it's done 

00:03:45.500 --> 00:03:49.610
 the chord of D major that is very 

00:03:47.360 --> 00:03:52.040
 seemed the difference between re major and 

00:03:49.610 --> 00:03:53.870
 D minor as in almost all chords 

00:03:52.040 --> 00:03:56.090
 that have the same name the difference 

00:03:53.870 --> 00:03:57.890
 it's always a finger that goes to a fret 

00:03:56.090 --> 00:04:00.200
 forward a fret back in 

00:03:57.890 --> 00:04:02.510
 this case is the number one finger for 

00:04:00.200 --> 00:04:04.790
 make the biggest reverb chord we have 

00:04:02.510 --> 00:04:06.710
 to bring down two and how is this 

00:04:04.790 --> 00:04:09.650
 position is a bit uncomfortable what 

00:04:06.710 --> 00:04:11.420
 let's do now it's without moving your finger 

00:04:09.650 --> 00:04:14.450
 number three you have to be here in 

00:04:11.420 --> 00:04:16.799
 your site we're going to change the two to the 

00:04:14.450 --> 00:04:18.780
 rope down where is the one 

00:04:16.799 --> 00:04:21.629
 to the top rope where is the 2 is 

00:04:18.780 --> 00:04:24.690
 say we change their position 

00:04:21.629 --> 00:04:26.400
 we change one finger for another so that 

00:04:24.690 --> 00:04:29.520
 we have a much more natural position 

00:04:26.400 --> 00:04:33.270
 it's worth finger 1 up in the third 

00:04:29.520 --> 00:04:35.520
 lost rope 2 down on the first and 

00:04:33.270 --> 00:04:37.560
 this finger right in between in the 

00:04:35.520 --> 00:04:38.980
 second and that's how the 

00:04:37.560 --> 00:04:41.490
 D major 

00:04:38.980 --> 00:04:41.490
 i 

00:04:42.409 --> 00:04:48.019
 as I tell you the difference between one and 

00:04:44.629 --> 00:04:49.789
 another one is a finger that goes back 

00:04:48.019 --> 00:04:52.309
 What happens is that of course we change 

00:04:49.789 --> 00:04:53.749
 position if you play the two chords 

00:04:52.309 --> 00:04:56.419
 followed then it is very likely that no 

00:04:53.749 --> 00:04:57.649
 note the difference is worth noting the 

00:04:56.419 --> 00:05:00.050
 difference what you have to do is 

00:04:57.649 --> 00:05:02.239
 give the most blow to the strings of 

00:05:00.050 --> 00:05:05.569
 down is to say good to sound good 

00:05:02.239 --> 00:05:07.519
 strong the first string because it is at 

00:05:05.569 --> 00:05:10.689
 after all, the only one that is different 

00:05:07.519 --> 00:05:10.689
 between the two chords 

00:05:11.150 --> 00:05:15.160
 if you play more on the strings above 

00:05:16.960 --> 00:05:20.889
 you will not notice the difference but as 

00:05:19.060 --> 00:05:22.990
 I tell you , we are never going to use points of 

00:05:20.889 --> 00:05:25.870
 minor and greater re therefore no 

00:05:22.990 --> 00:05:28.240
 you practice this change because you do not go 

00:05:25.870 --> 00:05:30.970
 to use never let's see what chords 

00:05:28.240 --> 00:05:33.160
 we can combine them we are going to focus 

00:05:30.970 --> 00:05:34.930
 in D minor D major we will 

00:05:33.160 --> 00:05:37.449
 use in the next election that is 

00:05:34.930 --> 00:05:39.860
 that we'll see what it combines well with 

00:05:37.449 --> 00:05:43.340
 d minor moment ' 

00:05:39.860 --> 00:05:46.840
 ok remember we came from the low 

00:05:43.340 --> 00:05:49.449
 we go everything and we advanced the third finger 

00:05:46.840 --> 00:05:53.130
 well this change if it's interesting from the 

00:05:49.449 --> 00:05:53.130
 minor to imitate 

00:05:53.289 --> 00:05:57.000
 same 

00:05:54.840 --> 00:05:59.860
 combine these two chords very well 

00:05:57.000 --> 00:06:01.210
 they sound very good together 

00:05:59.860 --> 00:06:03.370
 i 

00:06:01.210 --> 00:06:07.000
 an exercise that you can do then it is 

00:06:03.370 --> 00:06:12.060
 start from network upload to the upload to me 

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:15.270
 and go back to the and we start again network 

00:06:12.060 --> 00:06:15.270
 and the 

00:06:18.529 --> 00:06:25.219
 they are chords that sound very good together and 

00:06:21.529 --> 00:06:27.489
 on the contrary start from my go down 

00:06:25.219 --> 00:06:27.489
 until 

00:06:28.750 --> 00:06:31.230
 Y 

00:06:33.009 --> 00:06:37.990
 it's a very easy change between a chord and 

00:06:35.589 --> 00:06:40.360
 another is worth as soon as you have done it 

00:06:37.990 --> 00:06:42.460
 couple of days and you will see that ye out to 

00:06:40.360 --> 00:06:45.560
 it leaves quickly and then you can not 

00:06:42.460 --> 00:06:48.729
 try to combine it with network 

00:06:45.560 --> 00:06:51.370
 greater than less 

00:06:48.729 --> 00:06:54.580
 they sound good together and this one is a 

00:06:51.370 --> 00:06:56.949
 change that you have to move the whole hand not 

00:06:54.580 --> 00:06:59.680
 It is like that is very much worth 

00:06:56.949 --> 00:07:01.949
 this yes you have to move quite the 

00:06:59.680 --> 00:07:01.949
 hand 

00:07:03.719 --> 00:07:08.529
 but as I tell you , they combine very well 

00:07:05.949 --> 00:07:10.539
 together also the C major with D minor 

00:07:08.529 --> 00:07:13.209
 and it is an exercise that is going to come 

00:07:10.539 --> 00:07:15.830
 very well to go catching agility 

00:07:13.209 --> 00:07:17.840
 change of agreed that it's something that 

00:07:15.830 --> 00:07:21.110
 that always costs good because this has 

00:07:17.840 --> 00:07:23.090
 been the agreement of D minor and the chord 

00:07:21.110 --> 00:07:25.460
 of greater re 

00:07:23.090 --> 00:07:27.199
 we agreed to re major and we will review them 

00:07:25.460 --> 00:07:29.180
 in the next lesson do not worry 

00:07:27.199 --> 00:07:32.860
 let's move on now to see a couple of 

00:07:29.180 --> 00:07:32.860
 concepts about rhythm
