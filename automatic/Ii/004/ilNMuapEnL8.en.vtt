like<00:02:19.340> 50%<00:02:19.940> off<00:02:20.060> and<00:02:20.240> so<00:02:20.360> I<00:02:20.390> found<00:02:20.840> the<00:02:20.990> ugliest

00:02:21.100 --> 00:02:21.110 
like 50% off and so I found the ugliest

00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:23.230 
like 50% off and so I found the ugliest
cheapest<00:02:21.709> frame<00:02:21.890> I<00:02:22.010> could<00:02:22.160> find<00:02:22.370> and<00:02:22.640> I
