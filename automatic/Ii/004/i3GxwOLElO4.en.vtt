and<00:00:22.410> we<00:00:22.980> had<00:00:23.130> the<00:00:23.220> same<00:00:23.490> thing<00:00:23.760> that<00:00:23.939> we<00:00:24.060> had<00:00:24.269> in

00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:24.390 
and we had the same thing that we had in

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:26.810 
and we had the same thing that we had in
the<00:00:24.449> garage<00:00:24.830> where<00:00:25.830> we<00:00:25.949> have<00:00:26.130> a<00:00:26.160> tube<00:00:26.789> that

00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:26.820 
the garage where we have a tube that

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:30.740 
the garage where we have a tube that
they<00:00:27.180> built<00:00:27.480> up<00:00:27.890> from<00:00:28.890> the<00:00:29.010> slab<00:00:29.630> coming<00:00:30.630> up

00:00:30.740 --> 00:00:30.750 
they built up from the slab coming up

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:33.470 
they built up from the slab coming up
the<00:00:30.869> wall<00:00:31.109> in<00:00:31.439> this<00:00:31.740> case<00:00:32.009> this<00:00:32.970> room<00:00:33.300> was

00:00:33.470 --> 00:00:33.480 
the wall in this case this room was

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:35.210 
the wall in this case this room was
covered<00:00:33.780> with<00:00:33.930> wall<00:00:34.320> covering<00:00:34.770> neither

strips<00:00:37.920> on<00:00:38.160> the<00:00:38.670> wall<00:00:39.140> so<00:00:40.140> what<00:00:40.380> happened<00:00:40.770> was

00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:40.890 
strips on the wall so what happened was

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:42.470 
strips on the wall so what happened was
they<00:00:41.130> made<00:00:41.370> it<00:00:41.490> up<00:00:41.610> far<00:00:41.910> enough<00:00:41.940> where<00:00:42.360> they

00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:42.480 
they made it up far enough where they

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:46.610 
they made it up far enough where they
actually<00:00:42.740> contacted<00:00:43.740> a<00:00:43.970> food<00:00:44.970> source<00:00:45.270> and<00:00:45.630> now

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:46.620 
actually contacted a food source and now

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:48.080 
actually contacted a food source and now
they're<00:00:46.830> hooked<00:00:47.070> into<00:00:47.280> it<00:00:47.580> and<00:00:47.760> they're<00:00:47.940> not

00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:48.090 
they're hooked into it and they're not

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:50.600 
they're hooked into it and they're not
going<00:00:48.330> to<00:00:48.390> give<00:00:48.570> up<00:00:48.600> until<00:00:49.050> they're<00:00:49.610> they're

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:50.610 
going to give up until they're they're

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:54.110 
going to give up until they're they're
done<00:00:50.850> well<00:00:51.780> the<00:00:51.930> termites<00:00:52.350> warmers<00:00:52.950> are<00:00:53.280> about

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:54.120 
done well the termites warmers are about

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:55.700 
done well the termites warmers are about
an<00:00:54.270> eighth<00:00:54.390> of<00:00:54.540> an<00:00:54.690> inch<00:00:54.780> the<00:00:55.020> body's<00:00:55.320> about<00:00:55.560> an

00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:55.710 
an eighth of an inch the body's about an

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:57.640 
an eighth of an inch the body's about an
eighth<00:00:55.830> of<00:00:55.980> an<00:00:56.100> inch<00:00:56.220> and<00:00:56.550> cigar<00:00:56.910> shaped<00:00:57.240> and

00:00:57.640 --> 00:00:57.650 
eighth of an inch and cigar shaped and

00:00:57.650 --> 00:01:00.320 
eighth of an inch and cigar shaped and
the<00:00:58.650> wings<00:00:59.280> of<00:00:59.430> the<00:00:59.520> termite<00:00:59.910> are<00:01:00.030> twice<00:01:00.300> the

00:01:00.320 --> 00:01:00.330 
the wings of the termite are twice the

00:01:00.330 --> 00:01:02.690 
the wings of the termite are twice the
length<00:01:00.750> of<00:01:00.960> that<00:01:01.110> body<00:01:01.380> and<00:01:01.710> the<00:01:02.280> one<00:01:02.460> key

00:01:02.690 --> 00:01:02.700 
length of that body and the one key

00:01:02.700 --> 00:01:04.579 
length of that body and the one key
thing<00:01:02.940> with<00:01:03.120> that<00:01:03.300> the<00:01:03.570> termites<00:01:03.990> warmer<00:01:04.439> is

00:01:04.579 --> 00:01:04.589 
thing with that the termites warmer is

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:07.040 
thing with that the termites warmer is
that<00:01:04.799> the<00:01:04.949> wings<00:01:05.220> once<00:01:06.060> they<00:01:06.240> emerge<00:01:06.570> will

00:01:07.040 --> 00:01:07.050 
that the wings once they emerge will

00:01:07.050 --> 00:01:09.980 
that the wings once they emerge will
fall<00:01:07.560> off<00:01:07.800> the<00:01:08.010> termite<00:01:08.760> termite<00:01:09.570> inside<00:01:09.960> a

00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:09.990 
fall off the termite termite inside a

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:11.900 
fall off the termite termite inside a
home<00:01:10.230> will<00:01:10.410> crawl<00:01:10.650> into<00:01:10.830> cracks<00:01:11.190> and<00:01:11.370> crevices

00:01:11.900 --> 00:01:11.910 
home will crawl into cracks and crevices

00:01:11.910 --> 00:01:14.780 
home will crawl into cracks and crevices
and<00:01:12.200> basically<00:01:13.200> died<00:01:13.530> the<00:01:13.590> wings<00:01:14.040> left<00:01:14.370> behind

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:14.790 
and basically died the wings left behind

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:17.330 
and basically died the wings left behind
are<00:01:15.060> a<00:01:15.480> telltale<00:01:16.020> sign<00:01:16.050> that<00:01:16.380> swarm<00:01:17.040> occurred

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:17.340 
are a telltale sign that swarm occurred

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:20.690 
are a telltale sign that swarm occurred
so<00:01:18.240> if<00:01:18.420> someone<00:01:18.720> was<00:01:18.870> on<00:01:18.990> vacation<00:01:19.470> or<00:01:20.250> out<00:01:20.400> for

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:20.700 
so if someone was on vacation or out for

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:23.150 
so if someone was on vacation or out for
the<00:01:21.180> day<00:01:21.390> this<00:01:21.990> could<00:01:22.230> occur<00:01:22.560> but<00:01:22.800> the<00:01:22.920> wings

00:01:23.150 --> 00:01:23.160 
the day this could occur but the wings

00:01:23.160 --> 00:01:26.000 
the day this could occur but the wings
would<00:01:23.400> be<00:01:23.520> left<00:01:23.730> behind<00:01:23.910> and<00:01:24.560> just<00:01:25.560> by

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:26.010 
would be left behind and just by

00:01:26.010 --> 00:01:28.070 
would be left behind and just by
brushing<00:01:26.490> your<00:01:26.760> hand<00:01:27.030> over<00:01:27.330> the<00:01:27.420> floor<00:01:27.660> area

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:28.080 
brushing your hand over the floor area

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:29.660 
brushing your hand over the floor area
over<00:01:28.380> a<00:01:28.410> windowsill<00:01:28.740> they're<00:01:29.190> so<00:01:29.400> light<00:01:29.640> that

00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:29.670 
over a windowsill they're so light that

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:31.399 
over a windowsill they're so light that
they<00:01:29.970> get<00:01:30.120> picked<00:01:30.390> up<00:01:30.540> and<00:01:30.720> you<00:01:30.810> can<00:01:30.990> see<00:01:31.230> them

00:01:31.399 --> 00:01:31.409 
they get picked up and you can see them

00:01:31.409 --> 00:01:34.430 
they get picked up and you can see them
almost<00:01:32.040> looks<00:01:32.190> like<00:01:32.310> dust<00:01:32.700> so<00:01:33.480> it<00:01:33.960> can<00:01:34.260> be

00:01:34.430 --> 00:01:34.440 
almost looks like dust so it can be

00:01:34.440 --> 00:01:36.110 
almost looks like dust so it can be
missed<00:01:34.650> by<00:01:34.830> homeowners<00:01:35.280> but<00:01:35.610> hopefully<00:01:35.940> if

00:01:36.110 --> 00:01:36.120 
missed by homeowners but hopefully if

00:01:36.120 --> 00:01:37.760 
missed by homeowners but hopefully if
they're<00:01:36.270> sharp<00:01:36.540> enough<00:01:36.780> they'll<00:01:37.409> collect

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:37.770 
they're sharp enough they'll collect

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:41.590 
they're sharp enough they'll collect
them<00:01:37.980> and<00:01:38.070> give<00:01:38.280> us<00:01:38.400> a

00:01:41.590 --> 00:01:41.600 

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:43.940 

so<00:01:42.600> the<00:01:42.690> first<00:01:42.870> thing<00:01:43.020> we<00:01:43.230> do<00:01:43.380> when<00:01:43.410> we<00:01:43.650> arrive

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:43.950 
so the first thing we do when we arrive

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:46.610 
so the first thing we do when we arrive
at<00:01:44.100> a<00:01:44.190> turn<00:01:44.400> my<00:01:44.550> job<00:01:44.850> besides<00:01:45.840> greeting<00:01:46.530> the

00:01:46.610 --> 00:01:46.620 
at a turn my job besides greeting the

00:01:46.620 --> 00:01:50.140 
at a turn my job besides greeting the
homeowner<00:01:47.040> is<00:01:48.470> taking<00:01:49.470> the<00:01:49.590> sketch<00:01:49.920> or

00:01:50.140 --> 00:01:50.150 
homeowner is taking the sketch or

00:01:50.150 --> 00:01:52.580 
homeowner is taking the sketch or
diagram<00:01:51.150> that<00:01:51.330> the<00:01:51.480> salesman<00:01:51.990> has<00:01:52.140> drawn<00:01:52.440> up

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:52.590 
diagram that the salesman has drawn up

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:56.000 
diagram that the salesman has drawn up
initially<00:01:53.040> and<00:01:53.900> taking<00:01:54.900> that<00:01:55.050> and<00:01:55.290> reviewing

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:56.010 
initially and taking that and reviewing

00:01:56.010 --> 00:01:57.890 
initially and taking that and reviewing
it<00:01:56.220> against<00:01:56.550> the<00:01:56.640> structure<00:01:57.120> itself<00:01:57.210> is<00:01:57.720> where

00:01:57.890 --> 00:01:57.900 
it against the structure itself is where

00:01:57.900 --> 00:02:01.070 
it against the structure itself is where
there<00:01:58.140> so<00:01:59.070> once<00:01:59.940> we<00:02:00.150> do<00:02:00.330> that<00:02:00.360> we<00:02:00.630> go<00:02:00.780> in<00:02:00.930> all

00:02:01.070 --> 00:02:01.080 
there so once we do that we go in all

00:02:01.080 --> 00:02:02.510 
there so once we do that we go in all
the<00:02:01.200> areas<00:02:01.350> that<00:02:01.560> are<00:02:01.950> going<00:02:02.070> to<00:02:02.130> be<00:02:02.250> treated

00:02:02.510 --> 00:02:02.520 
the areas that are going to be treated

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:04.130 
the areas that are going to be treated
and<00:02:02.790> make<00:02:02.910> sure<00:02:02.940> they<00:02:03.240> will<00:02:03.390> match<00:02:03.630> up<00:02:03.660> and

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:04.140 
and make sure they will match up and

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:06.980 
and make sure they will match up and
once<00:02:04.980> they<00:02:05.190> do<00:02:05.250> then<00:02:06.210> we<00:02:06.420> can<00:02:06.570> begin<00:02:06.720> the

00:02:06.980 --> 00:02:06.990 
once they do then we can begin the

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:09.200 
once they do then we can begin the
treatment<00:02:07.200> if<00:02:07.860> we're<00:02:08.100> going<00:02:08.550> to<00:02:08.610> do<00:02:08.760> the<00:02:08.910> soil

00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:09.210 
treatment if we're going to do the soil

00:02:09.210 --> 00:02:13.190 
treatment if we're going to do the soil
he<00:02:09.510> would<00:02:09.720> trench<00:02:10.290> the<00:02:10.500> soil<00:02:10.770> and<00:02:11.360> then<00:02:12.360> trench

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:13.200 
he would trench the soil and then trench

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:15.470 
he would trench the soil and then trench
being<00:02:13.470> a<00:02:13.650> several<00:02:14.250> inches<00:02:14.400> wide<00:02:14.790> about<00:02:15.180> six

inches<00:02:15.660> deep<00:02:16.050> you<00:02:16.830> would<00:02:16.980> then<00:02:17.010> take<00:02:17.340> a<00:02:17.400> soil

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:17.730 
inches deep you would then take a soil

00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:21.170 
inches deep you would then take a soil
needle<00:02:18.180> and<00:02:18.710> treat<00:02:19.710> the<00:02:19.830> soil<00:02:20.130> every<00:02:20.520> 12<00:02:20.820> or<00:02:21.030> so

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:21.180 
needle and treat the soil every 12 or so

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:23.690 
needle and treat the soil every 12 or so
inches<00:02:21.530> and<00:02:22.530> work<00:02:22.740> the<00:02:22.890> needle<00:02:23.160> down<00:02:23.280> as<00:02:23.490> far

00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:23.700 
inches and work the needle down as far

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:25.910 
inches and work the needle down as far
as<00:02:23.820> you<00:02:23.910> can<00:02:24.030> get<00:02:24.240> it<00:02:24.360> once<00:02:25.050> that's<00:02:25.260> done<00:02:25.620> and

00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:25.920 
as you can get it once that's done and

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:28.220 
as you can get it once that's done and
then<00:02:26.550> covers<00:02:26.940> the<00:02:27.030> trench<00:02:27.330> and<00:02:27.570> in<00:02:27.960> stores

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:28.230 
then covers the trench and in stores

00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:31.240 
then covers the trench and in stores
terming<00:02:28.680> teller<00:02:28.890> states<00:02:29.900> that<00:02:30.900> would

00:02:31.240 --> 00:02:31.250 
terming teller states that would

00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:33.350 
terming teller states that would
determine<00:02:32.250> teller<00:02:32.550> states<00:02:32.850> are<00:02:33.030> there<00:02:33.120> so

00:02:33.350 --> 00:02:33.360 
determine teller states are there so

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:35.750 
determine teller states are there so
when<00:02:33.510> we<00:02:33.600> do<00:02:33.750> our<00:02:33.780> reinspection<00:02:34.610> what<00:02:35.610> we

00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:35.760 
when we do our reinspection what we

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:37.370 
when we do our reinspection what we
would<00:02:35.880> do<00:02:36.030> is<00:02:36.210> to<00:02:36.360> pull<00:02:36.630> them<00:02:36.810> out<00:02:36.960> to<00:02:37.170> see<00:02:37.200> if

00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:37.380 
would do is to pull them out to see if

00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:40.040 
would do is to pull them out to see if
we<00:02:37.500> have<00:02:37.620> any<00:02:37.800> termite<00:02:38.220> activity<00:02:38.810> then<00:02:39.810> when

00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:40.050 
we have any termite activity then when

00:02:40.050 --> 00:02:42.440 
we have any termite activity then when
it<00:02:40.140> comes<00:02:40.350> to<00:02:40.470> any<00:02:40.650> slab<00:02:41.070> or<00:02:41.100> slab<00:02:41.850> areas<00:02:42.270> which

00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:42.450 
it comes to any slab or slab areas which

00:02:42.450 --> 00:02:44.479 
it comes to any slab or slab areas which
would<00:02:42.600> be<00:02:42.750> concrete<00:02:43.290> you<00:02:43.739> would<00:02:43.890> then<00:02:43.920> take<00:02:44.280> it

00:02:44.479 --> 00:02:44.489 
would be concrete you would then take it

00:02:44.489 --> 00:02:47.479 
would be concrete you would then take it
as<00:02:44.580> a<00:02:44.730> rotary<00:02:45.720> hammer<00:02:46.080> drill<00:02:46.950> through<00:02:47.250> those

00:02:47.479 --> 00:02:47.489 
as a rotary hammer drill through those

00:02:47.489 --> 00:02:50.840 
as a rotary hammer drill through those
every<00:02:48.150> 12<00:02:48.480> inches<00:02:49.310> once<00:02:50.310> the<00:02:50.459> holes<00:02:50.670> are

00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:50.850 
every 12 inches once the holes are

00:02:50.850 --> 00:02:52.910 
every 12 inches once the holes are
rolled<00:02:51.060> drilled<00:02:51.360> in<00:02:51.570> the<00:02:51.750> applicable<00:02:52.440> spots

00:02:52.910 --> 00:02:52.920 
rolled drilled in the applicable spots

00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:57.530 
rolled drilled in the applicable spots
you<00:02:53.550> would<00:02:53.760> then<00:02:54.860> sweep<00:02:55.860> up<00:02:56.070> the<00:02:56.100> debris<00:02:56.550> and

00:02:57.530 --> 00:02:57.540 
you would then sweep up the debris and

00:02:57.540 --> 00:02:59.540 
you would then sweep up the debris and
that's<00:02:57.750> all<00:02:57.900> prepared<00:02:58.440> you<00:02:58.620> would<00:02:58.770> then<00:02:58.980> go<00:02:59.489> to

00:02:59.540 --> 00:02:59.550 
that's all prepared you would then go to

00:02:59.550 --> 00:03:01.400 
that's all prepared you would then go to
the<00:02:59.700> truck<00:02:59.970> and<00:03:00.000> get<00:03:00.270> the<00:03:00.450> treatment<00:03:00.720> hose<00:03:00.989> and

the appropriate tool

00:03:03.730 --> 00:03:06.360 
the appropriate tool
then<00:03:03.940> treat<00:03:04.540> those<00:03:04.750> slab<00:03:05.110> areas<00:03:05.590> through<00:03:06.280> the

00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:06.370 
then treat those slab areas through the

00:03:06.370 --> 00:03:08.910 
then treat those slab areas through the
hole<00:03:06.580> once<00:03:07.120> the<00:03:07.239> hole<00:03:07.420> is<00:03:07.450> treated<00:03:08.049> he<00:03:08.709> then

00:03:08.910 --> 00:03:08.920 
hole once the hole is treated he then

00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:29.320 
hole once the hole is treated he then
quark<00:03:09.340> and<00:03:09.549> cement<00:03:10.360> that<00:03:10.569> treatment
