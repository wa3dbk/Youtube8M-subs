00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:16.930 
- they just hold tighter but for the

00:02:16.930 --> 00:02:19.430 
- they just hold tighter but for the
average<00:02:17.110> citizen<00:02:17.770> we<00:02:18.220> can't<00:02:18.490> buy<00:02:18.670> him<00:02:18.790> anymore

even<00:03:49.299> I<00:03:51.420> even<00:03:52.420> guessed<00:03:53.049> it

00:03:53.880 --> 00:03:53.890 
even I even guessed it

00:03:53.890 --> 00:03:55.410 
even I even guessed it
yeah<00:03:54.489> I'm<00:03:54.580> getting<00:03:54.820> pretty<00:03:54.940> good<00:03:55.060> at<00:03:55.269> guessing

00:03:55.410 --> 00:03:55.420 
yeah I'm getting pretty good at guessing

00:03:55.420 --> 00:03:59.039 
yeah I'm getting pretty good at guessing
metric<00:03:56.019> sizes<00:03:56.260> this<00:03:56.680> one<00:03:56.739> was<00:03:57.040> 14<00:03:57.840> all<00:03:58.840> of

00:03:59.039 --> 00:03:59.049 
metric sizes this one was 14 all of

00:03:59.049 --> 00:04:04.229 
metric sizes this one was 14 all of
these<00:03:59.260> so<00:04:01.080> these<00:04:02.080> are<00:04:02.320> all<00:04:03.160> seen<00:04:03.519> now<00:04:04.209> that

00:04:04.229 --> 00:04:04.239 
these so these are all seen now that

00:04:04.239 --> 00:04:09.170 
these so these are all seen now that
one's<00:04:04.630> a<00:04:04.810> little<00:04:04.840> bit<00:04:05.260> loose<00:04:05.709> right<00:04:06.070> there<00:04:07.620> yes

00:04:09.170 --> 00:04:09.180 
one's a little bit loose right there yes

00:04:09.180 --> 00:04:12.840 
one's a little bit loose right there yes
so<00:04:10.180> tighten<00:04:10.570> it<00:04:10.690> up<00:04:10.810> a<00:04:10.959> little<00:04:11.080> bit<00:04:11.350> so<00:04:11.769> to<00:04:12.670> me

00:04:12.840 --> 00:04:12.850 
so tighten it up a little bit so to me

00:04:12.850 --> 00:04:20.449 
so tighten it up a little bit so to me
it's<00:04:13.150> our<00:04:14.549> this<00:04:15.549> is<00:04:15.790> a<00:04:15.820> little<00:04:16.150> bit<00:04:16.330> not<00:04:16.690> much

00:04:20.449 --> 00:04:20.459 

00:04:20.459 --> 00:04:23.250 

try<00:04:21.459> not<00:04:21.609> to<00:04:21.669> put<00:04:21.820> too<00:04:21.849> much<00:04:22.030> pressure<00:04:22.539> on<00:04:22.930> my

00:04:23.250 --> 00:04:23.260 
try not to put too much pressure on my

00:04:23.260 --> 00:04:25.230 
try not to put too much pressure on my
fake<00:04:23.470> good<00:04:23.740> and<00:04:23.919> snug

00:04:25.230 --> 00:04:25.240 
fake good and snug

00:04:25.240 --> 00:04:28.650 
fake good and snug

00:04:28.650 --> 00:04:28.660 
so that one's good and tight and this

00:04:28.660 --> 00:04:31.830 
so that one's good and tight and this
one<00:04:28.919> it's<00:04:29.919> a<00:04:30.100> little<00:04:30.220> bit<00:04:30.389> but<00:04:31.389> it's<00:04:31.539> good<00:04:31.750> and
