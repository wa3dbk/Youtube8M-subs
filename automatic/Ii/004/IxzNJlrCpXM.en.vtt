00:00:21.050 --> 00:00:21.060 
just thought it would be fun just to

just thought it would be fun just to
show<00:00:21.359> you<00:00:21.420> my<00:00:22.020> older<00:00:22.350> jeans<00:00:22.619> and<00:00:23.010> kind<00:00:23.850> of<00:00:24.080> see

00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:28.080 
the sizes that I used to be in the sizes

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:30.710 
the sizes that I used to be in the sizes
about<00:00:28.490> eventually<00:00:29.490> you<00:00:29.609> want<00:00:29.760> to<00:00:29.880> get<00:00:30.119> down<00:00:30.390> to

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:30.720 
about eventually you want to get down to

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:32.330 
about eventually you want to get down to
so<00:00:31.019> what<00:00:31.199> I'll<00:00:31.320> do<00:00:31.500> is<00:00:31.529> I'll<00:00:31.740> start<00:00:32.040> off<00:00:32.130> with

00:00:32.330 --> 00:00:32.340 
so what I'll do is I'll start off with

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:35.660 
so what I'll do is I'll start off with
the<00:00:32.489> biggest<00:00:32.940> size<00:00:33.149> of<00:00:33.600> jeans<00:00:34.410> that<00:00:34.649> I<00:00:34.829> own<00:00:35.130> and

the biggest size of jeans that I own and

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:39.020 
the biggest size of jeans that I own and
I'll<00:00:35.969> kind<00:00:36.329> of<00:00:36.420> wait<00:00:36.750> work<00:00:37.140> my<00:00:37.410> way<00:00:37.559> down<00:00:38.030> to

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:39.030 
I'll kind of wait work my way down to

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:43.100 
I'll kind of wait work my way down to
the<00:00:39.149> smallest<00:00:40.910> there's<00:00:41.910> only<00:00:42.059> four<00:00:42.390> sizes<00:00:42.930> so

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:43.110 
the smallest there's only four sizes so

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:45.229 
the smallest there's only four sizes so
there's<00:00:43.260> not<00:00:43.440> that<00:00:43.649> many<00:00:43.890> but<00:00:44.370> it<00:00:44.640> kind<00:00:45.149> of

00:00:45.229 --> 00:00:45.239 
there's not that many but it kind of

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:47.630 
there's not that many but it kind of
just<00:00:45.420> means<00:00:45.660> a<00:00:45.809> lot<00:00:45.989> to<00:00:46.170> me<00:00:46.320> to<00:00:46.770> be<00:00:46.890> able<00:00:46.980> to<00:00:47.129> fit

00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:47.640 
just means a lot to me to be able to fit

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:50.270 
just means a lot to me to be able to fit
back<00:00:47.789> into<00:00:48.030> them<00:00:48.360> and<00:00:48.770> you<00:00:49.770> know<00:00:49.890> all<00:00:50.100> meat

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:50.280 
back into them and you know all meat

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:51.860 
back into them and you know all meat
that<00:00:50.430> I'm<00:00:50.579> working<00:00:51.030> in<00:00:51.329> the<00:00:51.480> right<00:00:51.629> direction

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:51.870 
that I'm working in the right direction

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:56.209 
that I'm working in the right direction
so<00:00:53.120> that's<00:00:54.120> always<00:00:54.360> good<00:00:54.690> for<00:00:55.590> the<00:00:55.649> first<00:00:55.949> pair

00:00:56.209 --> 00:00:56.219 
so that's always good for the first pair

00:00:56.219 --> 00:01:00.260 
so that's always good for the first pair
of<00:00:56.250> jeans<00:00:56.520> that<00:00:56.699> I<00:00:56.820> have<00:00:58.039> having<00:00:59.039> a<00:00:59.129> huge<00:00:59.399> of

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:07.110 
really big and these are my fat fat

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:11.330 
really big and these are my fat fat
jeans<00:01:07.439> that's<00:01:08.130> what<00:01:08.310> I<00:01:08.340> call<00:01:08.610> them<00:01:10.280> these<00:01:11.280> are

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:11.340 
jeans that's what I call them these are

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:15.109 
jeans that's what I call them these are
what<00:01:11.729> I<00:01:11.820> wore<00:01:12.320> last<00:01:13.320> winter<00:01:13.890> and<00:01:14.159> winter<00:01:14.760> in

00:01:15.109 --> 00:01:15.119 
what I wore last winter and winter in

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:19.190 
what I wore last winter and winter in
Australia<00:01:15.720> is<00:01:15.990> in<00:01:16.020> July<00:01:16.590> so<00:01:17.270> about<00:01:18.270> seven<00:01:19.140> or

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:19.200 
Australia is in July so about seven or

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:20.350 
Australia is in July so about seven or
eight<00:01:19.380> months<00:01:19.530> ago

00:01:20.350 --> 00:01:20.360 
eight months ago

00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:25.390 
eight months ago
these<00:01:21.010> and<00:01:22.010> these<00:01:22.370> are<00:01:22.820> a<00:01:23.350> plus-size<00:01:24.350> gene<00:01:25.070> and

00:01:25.390 --> 00:01:25.400 
these and these are a plus-size gene and

00:01:25.400 --> 00:01:27.490 
these and these are a plus-size gene and
they're<00:01:26.060> our<00:01:26.240> size<00:01:26.540> 18

00:01:27.490 --> 00:01:27.500 
they're our size 18

00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:31.920 
they're our size 18
so<00:01:28.120> an<00:01:29.120> 18<00:01:29.690> which<00:01:30.590> i<00:01:30.800> think<00:01:30.860> is<00:01:31.160> about<00:01:31.370> a<00:01:31.430> size

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:31.930 
so an 18 which i think is about a size

00:01:31.930 --> 00:01:37.120 
so an 18 which i think is about a size
20<00:01:32.930> in<00:01:33.410> the<00:01:34.010> u.s.<00:01:34.430> they're<00:01:35.210> plus-size<00:01:35.570> so<00:01:36.170> that

00:01:37.120 --> 00:01:37.130 
20 in the u.s. they're plus-size so that

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:39.780 
20 in the u.s. they're plus-size so that
they're<00:01:37.670> bigger<00:01:38.000> than<00:01:38.150> a<00:01:38.270> regular<00:01:38.450> size<00:01:38.960> gene

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:39.790 
they're bigger than a regular size gene

00:01:39.790 --> 00:01:44.500 
they're bigger than a regular size gene
and<00:01:41.470> if<00:01:42.470> you<00:01:42.620> haven't<00:01:42.920> already<00:01:42.979> noticed<00:01:43.510> they

00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:44.510 
and if you haven't already noticed they

00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:46.390 
and if you haven't already noticed they
actually<00:01:44.900> contain<00:01:45.350> those<00:01:45.620> zip<00:01:45.920> so<00:01:46.190> they're

00:01:46.390 --> 00:01:46.400 
actually contain those zip so they're

00:01:46.400 --> 00:01:49.750 
actually contain those zip so they're
just<00:01:46.640> huge<00:01:47.330> as<00:01:47.660> rich<00:01:47.960> here<00:01:48.290> and<00:01:48.700> these<00:01:49.700> are

00:01:49.750 --> 00:01:49.760 
just huge as rich here and these are

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:52.000 
just huge as rich here and these are
actually<00:01:50.300> pretty<00:01:50.450> tight<00:01:50.870> on<00:01:51.050> me<00:01:51.260> when<00:01:51.650> I<00:01:51.680> wore

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:52.010 
actually pretty tight on me when I wore

00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:57.219 
actually pretty tight on me when I wore
them<00:01:53.020> they're<00:01:54.020> just<00:01:54.050> kind<00:01:54.950> of<00:01:55.630> sad<00:01:56.630> pair<00:01:56.960> jeans

00:01:57.219 --> 00:01:57.229 
them they're just kind of sad pair jeans

00:01:57.229 --> 00:01:59.680 
them they're just kind of sad pair jeans
really<00:01:57.560> I<00:01:57.920> mean<00:01:58.340> look<00:01:58.490> they<00:01:58.700> eat<00:01:59.000> they<00:01:59.330> kind<00:01:59.600> of

00:01:59.680 --> 00:01:59.690 
really I mean look they eat they kind of

00:01:59.690 --> 00:02:02.380 
really I mean look they eat they kind of
take<00:01:59.960> up<00:02:00.170> the<00:02:00.350> whole<00:02:00.530> screen<00:02:01.009> that's<00:02:02.000> how<00:02:02.180> big

00:02:02.380 --> 00:02:02.390 
take up the whole screen that's how big

00:02:02.390 --> 00:02:02.770 
take up the whole screen that's how big
they<00:02:02.540> are

00:02:02.770 --> 00:02:02.780 
they are

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:06.130 
they are
I<00:02:03.700> must<00:02:04.700> eight<00:02:05.000> kilos<00:02:05.540> and<00:02:05.780> I<00:02:05.840> haven't

00:02:06.130 --> 00:02:06.140 
I must eight kilos and I haven't

00:02:06.140 --> 00:02:08.050 
I must eight kilos and I haven't
actually<00:02:06.259> tried<00:02:06.619> these<00:02:06.890> on<00:02:06.950> you<00:02:07.310> so<00:02:07.910> that'd

00:02:08.050 --> 00:02:08.060 
actually tried these on you so that'd

00:02:08.060 --> 00:02:10.210 
actually tried these on you so that'd
probably<00:02:08.209> be<00:02:08.869> a<00:02:08.899> little<00:02:09.110> bit<00:02:09.290> baggy<00:02:09.649> on<00:02:09.920> me<00:02:10.040> now

00:02:10.210 --> 00:02:10.220 
probably be a little bit baggy on me now

00:02:10.220 --> 00:02:12.970 
probably be a little bit baggy on me now
I<00:02:10.250> think<00:02:10.429> I<00:02:11.030> kind<00:02:11.810> of<00:02:11.870> get<00:02:12.020> a<00:02:12.050> bit<00:02:12.230> sad<00:02:12.590> looking

00:02:12.970 --> 00:02:12.980 
I think I kind of get a bit sad looking

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:16.540 
I think I kind of get a bit sad looking
at<00:02:13.130> these<00:02:13.250> actually<00:02:13.730> because<00:02:14.470> absolutely<00:02:15.550> no

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:16.550 
at these actually because absolutely no

00:02:16.550 --> 00:02:19.780 
at these actually because absolutely no

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:19.790 
good memories with these chains so what

00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:22.540 
good memories with these chains so what
I'm<00:02:19.910> gonna<00:02:20.060> do<00:02:20.390> is<00:02:20.840> just<00:02:21.350> kind<00:02:21.680> of<00:02:21.830> screw<00:02:22.340> them

00:02:22.540 --> 00:02:22.550 
I'm gonna do is just kind of screw them

00:02:22.550 --> 00:02:26.050 
I'm gonna do is just kind of screw them
up<00:02:22.670> and<00:02:22.970> I'm<00:02:23.270> going<00:02:23.540> to<00:02:23.570> each<00:02:23.870> other<00:02:24.910> so<00:02:25.910> I'm

00:02:26.050 --> 00:02:26.060 
up and I'm going to each other so I'm

00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:27.910 
up and I'm going to each other so I'm
never<00:02:26.299> ever<00:02:26.450> going<00:02:26.989> to<00:02:27.080> have<00:02:27.440> those<00:02:27.590> chains

00:02:27.910 --> 00:02:27.920 
never ever going to have those chains

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:31.570 
never ever going to have those chains
ever<00:02:28.220> again<00:02:28.640> I'll<00:02:29.150> keep<00:02:29.480> them<00:02:29.660> just<00:02:29.720> for<00:02:30.580> just

00:02:31.570 --> 00:02:31.580 
ever again I'll keep them just for just

00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:33.220 
ever again I'll keep them just for just
to<00:02:31.790> kind<00:02:32.060> of<00:02:32.150> look<00:02:32.299> at<00:02:32.510> them<00:02:32.660> and<00:02:32.870> remind

00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:33.230 
to kind of look at them and remind

00:02:33.230 --> 00:02:35.050 
to kind of look at them and remind
myself<00:02:33.350> that<00:02:33.650> I<00:02:33.830> never<00:02:34.010> want<00:02:34.280> to<00:02:34.340> be<00:02:34.640> that

00:02:35.050 --> 00:02:35.060 
myself that I never want to be that

00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:37.990 
myself that I never want to be that
bigger<00:02:35.420> breaking<00:02:35.870> I<00:02:36.140> came<00:02:36.709> in<00:02:36.920> expertise<00:02:37.760> that

00:02:37.990 --> 00:02:38.000 
bigger breaking I came in expertise that

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:45.610 
bigger breaking I came in expertise that
I<00:02:38.060> have<00:02:40.989> these<00:02:41.989> black<00:02:42.320> ones<00:02:43.840> these<00:02:44.840> they're

00:02:45.610 --> 00:02:45.620 
I have these black ones these they're

00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:48.550 
I have these black ones these they're
not<00:02:45.830> a<00:02:46.010> plus<00:02:46.940> size<00:02:47.209> dream<00:02:47.690> that<00:02:48.049> they're<00:02:48.440> at

00:02:48.550 --> 00:02:48.560 
not a plus size dream that they're at

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:52.720 
not a plus size dream that they're at
regular<00:02:49.070> size<00:02:50.260> 20<00:02:51.260> gene<00:02:51.530> I<00:02:51.739> know<00:02:51.980> my<00:02:52.370> ordered

00:02:52.720 --> 00:02:52.730 
regular size 20 gene I know my ordered

00:02:52.730 --> 00:02:56.259 
regular size 20 gene I know my ordered
pairs<00:02:53.209> for<00:02:53.450> I<00:02:53.630> sized<00:02:54.519> 18<00:02:55.519> but<00:02:55.790> they<00:02:55.970> were<00:02:56.030> in

00:02:56.259 --> 00:02:56.269 
pairs for I sized 18 but they were in

00:02:56.269 --> 00:02:59.740 
pairs for I sized 18 but they were in
plus<00:02:56.480> size<00:02:56.750> size<00:02:57.080> so<00:02:57.440> a<00:02:57.830> size<00:02:58.700> 18<00:02:58.970> in<00:02:59.269> plus<00:02:59.510> size

00:02:59.740 --> 00:02:59.750 
plus size size so a size 18 in plus size

00:02:59.750 --> 00:03:03.100 
plus size size so a size 18 in plus size
probably<00:03:00.110> equals<00:03:00.590> about<00:03:00.709> our<00:03:00.950> size<00:03:01.630> 24<00:03:02.630> in

00:03:03.100 --> 00:03:03.110 
probably equals about our size 24 in

00:03:03.110 --> 00:03:06.440 
probably equals about our size 24 in
regular<00:03:03.709> jeans<00:03:04.610> I

00:03:06.440 --> 00:03:06.450 
regular jeans I

00:03:06.450 --> 00:03:09.320 
regular jeans I
my<00:03:07.230> first<00:03:07.620> weight-loss<00:03:08.190> goal<00:03:08.700> jeans<00:03:09.060> that<00:03:09.239> I

00:03:09.320 --> 00:03:09.330 
my first weight-loss goal jeans that I

00:03:09.330 --> 00:03:11.780 
my first weight-loss goal jeans that I
want<00:03:09.510> to<00:03:09.599> fit<00:03:09.750> into<00:03:09.900> their<00:03:10.709> a<00:03:11.010> regular<00:03:11.519> size

00:03:11.780 --> 00:03:11.790 
want to fit into their a regular size

00:03:11.790 --> 00:03:14.750 
want to fit into their a regular size
Jean<00:03:12.120> and<00:03:12.510> their<00:03:12.659> size<00:03:12.959> 20<00:03:13.530> and<00:03:13.799> they<00:03:14.489> have<00:03:14.730> a

00:03:14.750 --> 00:03:14.760 
Jean and their size 20 and they have a

00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:16.280 
Jean and their size 20 and they have a
zip<00:03:15.060> yay

00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:16.290 
zip yay

00:03:16.290 --> 00:03:18.410 
zip yay
so<00:03:16.920> these<00:03:17.069> are<00:03:17.280> the<00:03:17.340> first<00:03:17.610> pair<00:03:17.909> that<00:03:18.120> I<00:03:18.180> want

00:03:18.410 --> 00:03:18.420 
so these are the first pair that I want

00:03:18.420 --> 00:03:20.660 
so these are the first pair that I want
to<00:03:18.510> pick<00:03:18.690> two<00:03:18.930> they<00:03:19.470> still<00:03:19.739> look<00:03:19.920> quite<00:03:20.190> big<00:03:20.489> on

00:03:20.660 --> 00:03:20.670 
to pick two they still look quite big on

00:03:20.670 --> 00:03:23.509 
to pick two they still look quite big on
camera<00:03:21.120> but<00:03:21.420> they're<00:03:22.230> definitely<00:03:22.409> smaller<00:03:22.709> in

00:03:23.509 --> 00:03:23.519 
camera but they're definitely smaller in

00:03:23.519 --> 00:03:27.530 
camera but they're definitely smaller in
my<00:03:23.819> fat<00:03:24.060> fat<00:03:24.299> jeans<00:03:24.569> I<00:03:26.090> fitted<00:03:27.090> into<00:03:27.239> these

00:03:27.530 --> 00:03:27.540 
my fat fat jeans I fitted into these

00:03:27.540 --> 00:03:31.729 
my fat fat jeans I fitted into these
when<00:03:27.900> I<00:03:27.930> was<00:03:29.000> 19<00:03:30.000> 3<00:03:30.269> kilos<00:03:30.750> so<00:03:31.200> I'm<00:03:31.319> around<00:03:31.590> a

00:03:31.729 --> 00:03:31.739 
when I was 19 3 kilos so I'm around a

00:03:31.739 --> 00:03:34.270 
when I was 19 3 kilos so I'm around a
hundred<00:03:31.890> and<00:03:32.220> seven<00:03:32.489> kilos<00:03:32.670> at<00:03:32.970> the<00:03:33.060> moment<00:03:33.510> so

00:03:34.270 --> 00:03:34.280 
hundred and seven kilos at the moment so

00:03:34.280 --> 00:03:40.729 
hundred and seven kilos at the moment so
I've<00:03:35.280> got<00:03:38.030> so<00:03:39.030> I've<00:03:39.090> got<00:03:39.299> about<00:03:39.390> 13<00:03:40.079> kilos<00:03:40.500> to

00:03:40.729 --> 00:03:40.739 
I've got so I've got about 13 kilos to

00:03:40.739 --> 00:03:43.280 
I've got so I've got about 13 kilos to
lose<00:03:40.769> before<00:03:41.099> I<00:03:41.370> can<00:03:41.760> comfortably<00:03:42.299> fit<00:03:42.810> into

00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:43.290 
lose before I can comfortably fit into

00:03:43.290 --> 00:03:45.890 
lose before I can comfortably fit into
these<00:03:43.590> these<00:03:44.160> are<00:03:44.400> the<00:03:44.489> my<00:03:44.879> first<00:03:45.180> goal<00:03:45.629> Jean

00:03:45.890 --> 00:03:45.900 
these these are the my first goal Jean

00:03:45.900 --> 00:03:48.890 
these these are the my first goal Jean
so<00:03:46.670> it'll<00:03:47.670> kind<00:03:47.819> of<00:03:47.940> be<00:03:48.000> a<00:03:48.090> bit<00:03:48.269> of<00:03:48.359> a<00:03:48.450> happy<00:03:48.629> day

00:03:48.890 --> 00:03:48.900 
so it'll kind of be a bit of a happy day

00:03:48.900 --> 00:03:50.780 
so it'll kind of be a bit of a happy day
when<00:03:49.109> I<00:03:49.200> can<00:03:49.260> fit<00:03:49.590> into<00:03:49.709> these<00:03:49.920> is<00:03:50.640> that

00:03:50.780 --> 00:03:50.790 
when I can fit into these is that

00:03:50.790 --> 00:03:52.160 
when I can fit into these is that
everything<00:03:51.329> I'll<00:03:51.480> be<00:03:51.750> on<00:03:51.840> the<00:03:51.989> right<00:03:52.140> path

00:03:52.160 --> 00:03:52.170 
everything I'll be on the right path

00:03:52.170 --> 00:03:55.339 
everything I'll be on the right path
then<00:03:53.010> if<00:03:53.579> I<00:03:53.760> tried<00:03:54.060> these<00:03:54.239> on<00:03:54.450> now<00:03:54.480> I<00:03:54.690> don't

00:03:55.339 --> 00:03:55.349 
then if I tried these on now I don't

00:03:55.349 --> 00:03:57.289 
then if I tried these on now I don't
think<00:03:55.709> I<00:03:55.829> could<00:03:56.069> even<00:03:56.220> I<00:03:56.609> wouldn't<00:03:56.879> be<00:03:56.970> able<00:03:57.120> to

00:03:57.289 --> 00:03:57.299 
think I could even I wouldn't be able to

00:03:57.299 --> 00:04:00.140 
think I could even I wouldn't be able to
do<00:03:58.079> them<00:03:58.319> up<00:03:58.470> I<00:03:58.769> don't<00:03:59.250> think<00:03:59.489> the<00:03:59.670> two<00:03:59.909> ends

00:04:00.140 --> 00:04:00.150 
do them up I don't think the two ends

00:04:00.150 --> 00:04:02.390 
do them up I don't think the two ends
bit<00:04:00.450> would<00:04:00.599> even<00:04:00.900> would<00:04:01.440> even<00:04:01.709> go<00:04:01.890> past<00:04:01.920> my

00:04:02.390 --> 00:04:02.400 
bit would even would even go past my

00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:04.339 
bit would even would even go past my
stomach's<00:04:02.849> I'll<00:04:03.030> show<00:04:03.299> you<00:04:03.359> a<00:04:03.510> quick<00:04:03.989> picture
