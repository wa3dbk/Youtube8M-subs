00:00:00.199 --> 00:00:06.779
 good afternoon with you levkina litvinenko i 

00:00:04.170 --> 00:00:09.719
 I want to show you today how I am 

00:00:06.779 --> 00:00:13.040
 made a cat like that 

00:00:09.719 --> 00:00:17.160
 papier-mâché campers 

00:00:13.040 --> 00:00:20.400
 start cutting out of corrugated 

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:23.630
 cardboard figure and glue on the base 

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:27.960
 the basis of the company it may be the county 

00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:31.980
 I for example made just two layers 

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:35.850
 cardboard and i really liked then 

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:37.790
 that's how it looks then all the edges 

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:41.129
 thickened here this cardboard 

00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:44.520
 Whether we close up papier-mache and then granules 

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:47.840
 Putty finish it all should 

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:52.160
 dry up this one here is our whole cat and 

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:52.160
 then we start to dream 

00:00:52.460 --> 00:00:58.980
 make branches of trees leaves and 

00:00:55.860 --> 00:01:02.340
 flowers it's all done putty 

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:05.460
 putty happens in finished form 

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:09.600
 so it is very convenient it is so small 

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:12.630
 jars and if not then dry 

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:16.799
 putty can make such an empty 

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:20.810
 pretty dream and do petals with 

00:01:16.799 --> 00:01:25.530
 using the stage flooded with a little knife 

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:27.930
 it turns out pretty simple and not at all 

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:31.520
 what do i like the most when 

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:34.590
 this is what you get then not always 

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:38.009
 guess what is pretty 

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:43.979
 suddenly we are almost always nice then 

00:01:38.009 --> 00:01:47.610
 it is very important to paint over with dark color or 

00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:50.759
 children and color a little bit different is not easy and 

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:51.799
 brown ones and pinkish since we 

00:01:50.759 --> 00:01:54.659
 to nature 

00:01:51.799 --> 00:01:56.880
 mean to then when we 

00:01:54.659 --> 00:02:00.780
 from above we will go so we will see that 

00:01:56.880 --> 00:02:04.130
 this background was so varied since 

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:08.289
 like grass like plants around it 

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:10.489
 in order to avoid gaps important 

00:02:08.289 --> 00:02:16.690
 close everything up carefully 

00:02:10.489 --> 00:02:20.860
 white on them get yourself and then 

00:02:16.690 --> 00:02:24.819
 wipe these all surfaces 

00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:29.410
 light color and you can do it 

00:02:24.819 --> 00:02:32.660
 absolutely almost dry brush or 

00:02:29.410 --> 00:02:35.150
 Sponge passing just above you can 

00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:39.080
 go here right here let's say I passed 

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:42.310
 just white paint new paint can 

00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:45.290
 just buy paint 

00:02:42.310 --> 00:02:49.130
 acrylic building stores this 

00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:53.959
 Much cheaper tina and offspring at least 

00:02:49.130 --> 00:02:58.730
 in order not to be afraid and 

00:02:53.959 --> 00:03:00.170
 use it freely so it means we 

00:02:58.730 --> 00:03:02.690
 it's rubbed 

00:03:00.170 --> 00:03:04.970
 see if somewhere somewhere you don’t 

00:03:02.690 --> 00:03:09.109
 liked it you can at this stage 

00:03:04.970 --> 00:03:12.230
 it's all about change and that's when it comes 

00:03:09.109 --> 00:03:15.019
 detail you see what else here 

00:03:12.230 --> 00:03:18.530
 flowers have appeared here, these here this 

00:03:15.019 --> 00:03:22.489
 appeared like pale pale pink 

00:03:18.530 --> 00:03:23.510
 so blue is this already on top of that 

00:03:22.489 --> 00:03:25.549
 what did you do 

00:03:23.510 --> 00:03:29.530
 you can just walk on top 

00:03:25.549 --> 00:03:32.420
 tassel nasty and draw 

00:03:29.530 --> 00:03:35.480
 to draw something that you more 

00:03:32.420 --> 00:03:39.230
 like somewhere effort somewhere maybe 

00:03:35.480 --> 00:03:41.620
 too dark so in the snout too 

00:03:39.230 --> 00:03:45.410
 need to work well that's it 

00:03:41.620 --> 00:03:49.940
 Forms are shown at first I did 

00:03:45.410 --> 00:03:54.049
 such a cat, but I didn't like it here 

00:03:49.940 --> 00:03:58.370
 to the limit and get this cat 

00:03:54.049 --> 00:04:00.950
 and me she is absolutely island so I 

00:03:58.370 --> 00:04:04.220
 I have already stopped at this option 

00:04:00.950 --> 00:04:08.359
 I think that you agree with me that so 

00:04:04.220 --> 00:04:10.830
 much more interesting on this all can 

00:04:08.359 --> 00:04:12.540
 subscribe because 

00:04:10.830 --> 00:04:15.900
 I think that in this control I will 

00:04:12.540 --> 00:04:19.320
 work and then you can look at 

00:04:15.900 --> 00:04:23.030
 site of our work with my daughter or 

00:04:19.320 --> 00:04:26.970
 genes litvinenko and in general all the luck 

00:04:23.030 --> 00:04:30.150
 Come see the teacher and maybe 

00:04:26.970 --> 00:04:32.600
 that you yourself will merge all good 

00:04:30.150 --> 00:04:32.600
 everything
