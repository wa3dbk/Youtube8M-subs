00:00:20.630 --> 00:00:25.390
 Well, for the first time we can play 

00:00:22.820 --> 00:00:29.269
 with a firefox or directly us 

00:00:25.390 --> 00:00:31.189
 it's about the zte open that they just 

00:00:29.269 --> 00:00:34.750
 present in Barcelona on the mobile 

00:00:31.189 --> 00:00:34.750
 world congress first day of fair 

00:00:34.780 --> 00:00:40.899
 we already know that it is a project of the 

00:00:37.960 --> 00:00:42.910
 mozilla foundation in which many 

00:00:40.899 --> 00:00:47.170
 especially telephone operators 

00:00:42.910 --> 00:00:50.170
 america mobile is chyna mobile have done 

00:00:47.170 --> 00:00:53.679
 a very strong bet 

00:00:50.170 --> 00:00:56.710
 they are phones that are going to come out in theory 

00:00:53.679 --> 00:00:58.510
 at very low cost but there really is 

00:00:56.710 --> 00:01:00.550
 what to point out 

00:00:58.510 --> 00:01:04.180
 that not only are phones going to come out 

00:01:00.550 --> 00:01:06.310
 low range but also in high-end like 

00:01:04.180 --> 00:01:08.530
 we see the capacity processors 

00:01:06.310 --> 00:01:12.610
 processes is not slower is quite 

00:01:08.530 --> 00:01:16.860
 well we know that everything is web 

00:01:12.610 --> 00:01:16.860
 and that we have all kinds of applications 

00:01:16.909 --> 00:01:21.020
 of which for example we will see 

00:01:19.030 --> 00:01:22.719
 some that we like how can 

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:25.340
 work as videos can be 

00:01:22.719 --> 00:01:26.659
 let's see what it offers us we turn the 

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:29.170
 screen projections sensor 

00:01:26.659 --> 00:01:29.170
 movement 

00:01:31.870 --> 00:01:35.020
 and we see that despite the brightness that 

00:01:33.580 --> 00:01:37.230
 we have in the room where we are 

00:01:35.020 --> 00:01:37.230
 recording 

00:01:38.150 --> 00:01:42.880
 the experience is pretty good 

00:01:44.909 --> 00:01:51.900
 return to the screen as always 

00:01:48.580 --> 00:01:51.900
 let's see the clock 

00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:59.390
 the whole system is based on html5 

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:04.500
 from here we can receive some notes 

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:07.770
 application is not yet worked and 

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:10.770
 we say it 's a beta but honestly 

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:14.300
 I think the experience is a lot 

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:14.300
 better than I thought 

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:24.480
 let's see what happens for example with the 

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:24.480
 sound we go to music 

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:28.220
 and it is ready 

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:40.930
 but our sounds 

00:02:38.510 --> 00:02:45.000
 to see the back 

00:02:40.930 --> 00:02:45.000
 this week the flavor 

00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:51.620
 a volume key 

00:02:52.390 --> 00:02:55.950
 central is the mini usb 

00:02:56.040 --> 00:03:00.260
 audio output of three sets 

00:03:03.890 --> 00:03:09.650
 good we will have occasion to try it more 

00:03:06.740 --> 00:03:11.780
 carefully but the principle is in 

00:03:09.650 --> 00:03:17.280
 the news of the fair 

00:03:11.780 --> 00:03:19.800
 17 operators a foundation and a whole 

00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:21.810
 the operating system that will have a lot 

00:03:19.800 --> 00:03:24.170
 to say especially in the markets 

00:03:21.810 --> 00:03:24.170
 emerging 

00:03:40.600 --> 00:03:42.900
 yes
