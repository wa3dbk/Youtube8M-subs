00:00:00.104 --> 00:00:02.785
 Dear photographer friends, Hi! I am Mike Sebble. 

00:00:02.785 --> 00:00:06.587
 I am in Beijing, in an apartment hotel. 

00:00:06.587 --> 00:00:10.585
 We will use this apartment to take some pictures of the cool human landscape. 

00:00:10.585 --> 00:00:14.384
 I am with my friends, Sasha and Linxi, 

00:00:14.384 --> 00:00:19.352
 I will show you how to take a cool photo of the human body landscape. 

00:00:19.352 --> 00:00:22.352
 And with very little effort and minimalist equipment. 

00:00:22.352 --> 00:00:24.958
 So please continue watching. 

00:00:27.017 --> 00:00:32.805
 The reason I chose an apartment hotel instead of a regular hotel is: 

00:00:33.101 --> 00:00:37.161
 It has a small but sophisticated kitchen in the room. 

00:00:37.377 --> 00:00:40.649
 Not because I am good at cooking, although I love cooking. 

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:45.012
 See what we found: kitchen paper. 

00:00:45.012 --> 00:00:48.849
 Simple, white, and somewhat transparent kitchen paper. 

00:00:48.849 --> 00:00:53.849
 It can be used as a astigmatism cloth for flash lamps. 

00:00:53.849 --> 00:00:58.048
 So if we can find tools to fix kitchen paper 

00:00:58.048 --> 00:01:01.378
 We can use it to simulate the effect of a strip of soft light. 

00:01:01.378 --> 00:01:04.766
 This is what I will do next. 

00:01:09.849 --> 00:01:17.253
 I found this TV cabinet, which can be used as a horizontal strip light. 

00:01:17.253 --> 00:01:21.897
 I will use kitchen paper as a astigmatism cloth. 

00:01:21.897 --> 00:01:24.216
 Use two flashlights to illuminate. 

00:01:24.216 --> 00:01:29.454
 One is placed here, one is placed here. 

00:01:29.454 --> 00:01:40.150
 Secure the kitchen paper with tape before the flash. 

00:01:40.728 --> 00:01:46.229
 I hope I can use it. I have not practiced it beforehand. 

00:01:50.781 --> 00:01:59.681
 When you patiently watch me stick the kitchen paper to the TV cabinet 

00:02:00.299 --> 00:02:01.779
 I can answer this question: 

00:02:01.779 --> 00:02:07.685
 Is there any reason to put orange tape on the flash money? 

00:02:07.956 --> 00:02:10.949
 Actually, no! There is no reason at all. 

00:02:11.284 --> 00:02:13.579
 If there is, it is because I shot all day 

00:02:13.579 --> 00:02:17.854
 Use both spotlights and flash 

00:02:17.854 --> 00:02:20.422
 Sometimes I have to use both lights 

00:02:20.422 --> 00:02:24.099
 Sometimes, just like now, I only need a flash. 

00:02:24.099 --> 00:02:32.220
 I know myself. I know that I will forget to stick tape. 

00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:34.019
 I will forget to adjust the white balance. 

00:02:34.019 --> 00:02:37.508
 When I switch from the spotlight to the flash, or vice versa. 

00:02:37.508 --> 00:02:42.100
 So I keep a habit of sticking the tape all day. 

00:02:42.100 --> 00:02:45.344
 All day, the white balance is set on the spotlight. 

00:02:45.344 --> 00:02:50.754
 That's it. Nothing else. 

00:02:50.754 --> 00:02:54.059
 At this shooting scene, I will manually set the flash. 

00:02:54.059 --> 00:02:59.182
 I will first set the flash to 1/4. 

00:02:59.182 --> 00:03:08.057
 I will use the built-in flash to control them. 

00:03:08.899 --> 00:03:17.100
 I will probably set the built-in flash in 1/32. 

00:03:17.100 --> 00:03:21.824
 Used to fill dark shadows. Nothing else. 

00:03:21.824 --> 00:03:23.781
 Still have to do one thing 

00:03:23.781 --> 00:03:29.142
 Because I want to take pictures of the human body in front of the strip lights. 

00:03:29.142 --> 00:03:33.941
 You sometimes see distant backgrounds in human landscape photos. 

00:03:33.941 --> 00:03:35.771
 I want the background to be black. 

00:03:35.771 --> 00:03:39.742
 The other thing is: I need a model to lie on. 

00:03:39.742 --> 00:03:47.342
 So I will put this reflective material, the black side, here. 

00:03:47.342 --> 00:03:52.544
 Here, inside, it will definitely be very dark. 

00:03:52.544 --> 00:03:55.755
 But here, the ground reflects light. 

00:03:55.755 --> 00:04:00.211
 Although the wooden floor is very nice, I still want black, dark black. 

00:04:00.211 --> 00:04:06.062
 This material can help me. It will be very dark. 

00:04:06.853 --> 00:04:08.145
 That's it! 

00:04:08.145 --> 00:04:12.086
 Let's start shooting and see. 

00:04:21.444 --> 00:04:24.071
 awesome. It's a really good strip light. 

00:04:24.071 --> 00:04:27.541
 The next step is to start. 

00:04:51.495 --> 00:04:57.336
 [……last piece! Thank you! ] 

00:04:57.336 --> 00:05:01.056
 Look, very easy to use. 

00:05:01.056 --> 00:05:04.175
 I really like the photos I took this time. 

00:05:04.175 --> 00:05:11.096
 Of course, it is a bit of luck to find furniture that makes strip lights. 

00:05:11.096 --> 00:05:14.057
 But, hey, how can you live without luck? 

00:05:14.057 --> 00:05:18.482
 I hope that you will have a little luck in finding the right tools. 

00:05:18.482 --> 00:05:21.534
 I also hope that you find this video inspiring. 

00:05:21.534 --> 00:05:25.732
 If you think so, please leave us a message. I really like feedback. 

00:05:25.732 --> 00:05:30.895
 Anyway, I wish you a happy shooting and wish you a good shot! 

00:05:30.895 --> 00:05:32.577
 Goodbye. 

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:38.000
