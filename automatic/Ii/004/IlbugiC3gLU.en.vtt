00:00:17.810 --> 00:00:17.820 
working progress um this is a really

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:21.620 
working progress um this is a really
basic<00:00:17.940> again<00:00:18.840> the<00:00:19.289> basic<00:00:19.470> one<00:00:20.270> no<00:00:21.270> doubt<00:00:21.449> can

00:00:21.620 --> 00:00:21.630 
basic again the basic one no doubt can

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:23.990 
basic again the basic one no doubt can
be<00:00:21.750> improved<00:00:21.990> in<00:00:22.350> certain<00:00:22.710> ways<00:00:22.740> and<00:00:22.890> put<00:00:23.850> it

00:00:23.990 --> 00:00:24.000 
be improved in certain ways and put it

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.330 
be improved in certain ways and put it
for<00:00:24.300> now<00:00:24.390> it<00:00:24.600> works<00:00:25.590> pretty<00:00:25.830> well<00:00:25.920> say<00:00:26.220> yeah

00:00:26.330 --> 00:00:26.340 
for now it works pretty well say yeah

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:28.220 
for now it works pretty well say yeah
you've<00:00:26.490> got<00:00:26.519> a<00:00:26.670> corridor<00:00:26.990> so<00:00:27.990> here's<00:00:28.170> my

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:28.230 
you've got a corridor so here's my

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:31.460 
you've got a corridor so here's my
corridor<00:00:28.910> we<00:00:29.910> got<00:00:30.060> a<00:00:30.090> lever<00:00:30.359> what<00:00:31.170> does<00:00:31.320> this

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:31.470 
corridor we got a lever what does this

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:36.100 
corridor we got a lever what does this
leave<00:00:31.679> possibly<00:00:32.460> do<00:00:33.020> but<00:00:34.020> opens<00:00:34.350> the<00:00:34.469> war

00:00:36.100 --> 00:00:36.110 
leave possibly do but opens the war

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:38.180 
leave possibly do but opens the war
pretty<00:00:37.110> straightforward<00:00:37.410> now<00:00:37.890> this<00:00:38.040> is

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:38.190 
pretty straightforward now this is

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:39.889 
pretty straightforward now this is
actually<00:00:38.370> a<00:00:38.610> really<00:00:38.879> simple<00:00:39.300> door<00:00:39.480> it's<00:00:39.629> not

00:00:39.889 --> 00:00:39.899 
actually a really simple door it's not

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:42.560 
actually a really simple door it's not
as<00:00:40.020> clever<00:00:40.460> as<00:00:41.460> the<00:00:41.700> door<00:00:41.910> that<00:00:42.120> Jed<00:00:42.360> made

00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:42.570 
as clever as the door that Jed made

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:46.279 
as clever as the door that Jed made
don't<00:00:43.469> sealed<00:00:44.190> me<00:00:44.370> in<00:00:44.460> here<00:00:44.670> there<00:00:45.090> we<00:00:45.210> go<00:00:45.329> not

00:00:46.279 --> 00:00:46.289 
don't sealed me in here there we go not

00:00:46.289 --> 00:00:49.160 
don't sealed me in here there we go not
as<00:00:46.440> clever<00:00:46.680> as<00:00:46.950> that<00:00:47.190> but<00:00:48.059> now<00:00:48.480> it's<00:00:48.809> quite

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:49.170 
as clever as that but now it's quite

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:50.900 
as clever as that but now it's quite
quite<00:00:49.590> amusing<00:00:49.860> and<00:00:50.100> pc<00:00:50.340> now<00:00:50.489> so<00:00:50.789> i'll<00:00:50.879> just

00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:50.910 
quite amusing and pc now so i'll just

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:53.299 
quite amusing and pc now so i'll just
stopping<00:00:51.360> in<00:00:51.449> something<00:00:51.840> dig<00:00:52.590> through<00:00:52.980> but

00:00:53.299 --> 00:00:53.309 
stopping in something dig through but

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:54.350 
stopping in something dig through but
you<00:00:53.340> know<00:00:53.399> you've<00:00:53.610> got<00:00:53.670> to<00:00:53.730> assume<00:00:54.059> that<00:00:54.270> this

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:54.360 
you know you've got to assume that this

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:55.670 
you know you've got to assume that this
is<00:00:54.420> maybe<00:00:54.690> a<00:00:54.780> protected<00:00:55.320> area<00:00:55.410> on<00:00:55.649> a

00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:55.680 
is maybe a protected area on a

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:58.279 
is maybe a protected area on a
multiplayer<00:00:56.280> kind<00:00:56.579> of<00:00:56.670> thing<00:00:56.820> you<00:00:57.180> can<00:00:57.899> seal

00:00:58.279 --> 00:00:58.289 
multiplayer kind of thing you can seal

00:00:58.289 --> 00:01:00.139 
multiplayer kind of thing you can seal
someone<00:00:58.680> in<00:00:58.770> that<00:00:58.920> room<00:00:58.980> and<00:00:59.489> that's<00:00:59.760> it<00:01:00.030> they

00:01:00.139 --> 00:01:00.149 
someone in that room and that's it they

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:05.899 
someone in that room and that's it they
are<00:01:00.270> doomed<00:01:01.039> so<00:01:02.039> how<00:01:02.460> does<00:01:03.030> it<00:01:03.449> work<00:01:03.870> well<00:01:04.909> let

00:01:05.899 --> 00:01:05.909 
are doomed so how does it work well let

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:08.480 
are doomed so how does it work well let
me<00:01:06.090> show<00:01:06.119> you<00:01:06.390> the<00:01:06.750> workings<00:01:07.619> pretty

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:08.490 
me show you the workings pretty

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:10.730 
me show you the workings pretty
straightforward<00:01:09.060> to<00:01:09.150> be<00:01:09.240> honest<00:01:09.479> so<00:01:10.200> here<00:01:10.590> we

00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:10.740 
straightforward to be honest so here we

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:12.649 
straightforward to be honest so here we
go<00:01:10.770> what<00:01:11.369> I've<00:01:11.490> done<00:01:11.520> is<00:01:11.729> I've<00:01:11.939> taken<00:01:12.000> away<00:01:12.630> a

00:01:12.649 --> 00:01:12.659 
go what I've done is I've taken away a

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:13.609 
go what I've done is I've taken away a
lot<00:01:12.869> of<00:01:12.930> the<00:01:13.020> walls<00:01:13.229> and<00:01:13.409> I'm<00:01:13.500> actually

00:01:13.609 --> 00:01:13.619 
lot of the walls and I'm actually

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:16.100 
lot of the walls and I'm actually
replace<00:01:14.070> the<00:01:14.310> door<00:01:14.610> itself<00:01:15.119> with<00:01:15.390> glass<00:01:15.689> so

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:16.110 
replace the door itself with glass so

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:18.230 
replace the door itself with glass so
you<00:01:16.200> can<00:01:16.350> see<00:01:16.500> what's<00:01:16.650> going<00:01:16.740> on<00:01:17.100> and<00:01:18.000> as<00:01:18.119> you

00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:18.240 
you can see what's going on and as you

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:19.940 
you can see what's going on and as you
can<00:01:18.390> see<00:01:18.420> looking<00:01:18.810> in<00:01:19.110> here<00:01:19.439> the<00:01:19.740> door<00:01:19.770> is

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:19.950 
can see looking in here the door is

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:22.760 
can see looking in here the door is
closed<00:01:20.400> Press<00:01:21.180> that<00:01:21.210> and<00:01:21.420> it<00:01:21.570> opens<00:01:21.960> and<00:01:22.650> the

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:22.770 
closed Press that and it opens and the

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:24.800 
closed Press that and it opens and the
actual<00:01:22.890> door<00:01:23.369> themselves<00:01:23.729> go<00:01:23.880> the<00:01:24.270> top<00:01:24.479> the

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:24.810 
actual door themselves go the top the

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:27.230 
actual door themselves go the top the
bottom<00:01:24.960> two<00:01:25.590> pieces<00:01:26.220> go<00:01:26.369> down<00:01:26.580> and<00:01:26.880> the<00:01:27.210> top

00:01:27.230 --> 00:01:27.240 
bottom two pieces go down and the top

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:29.630 
bottom two pieces go down and the top
two<00:01:27.659> pieces<00:01:28.049> go<00:01:28.229> up<00:01:28.409> as<00:01:29.100> you<00:01:29.189> can<00:01:29.310> see<00:01:29.490> they

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:29.640 
two pieces go up as you can see they

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:31.520 
two pieces go up as you can see they
just<00:01:29.850> rest<00:01:30.450> in<00:01:30.659> the<00:01:30.780> floor<00:01:31.049> and<00:01:31.259> ceiling

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:31.530 
just rest in the floor and ceiling

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:35.179 
just rest in the floor and ceiling
respectively<00:01:32.509> each<00:01:33.509> one<00:01:33.960> has<00:01:34.200> a<00:01:34.229> piston<00:01:34.680> now

00:01:35.179 --> 00:01:35.189 
respectively each one has a piston now

00:01:35.189 --> 00:01:36.289 
respectively each one has a piston now
always<00:01:35.369> remember<00:01:35.490> when<00:01:35.790> you're<00:01:35.880> placing<00:01:36.060> a

00:01:36.289 --> 00:01:36.299 
always remember when you're placing a

00:01:36.299 --> 00:01:39.740 
always remember when you're placing a
piston<00:01:36.659> always<00:01:36.900> be<00:01:37.079> sort<00:01:37.740> of<00:01:37.770> facing<00:01:38.750> towards

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:39.750 
piston always be sort of facing towards

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:42.560 
piston always be sort of facing towards
where<00:01:40.650> you<00:01:40.860> want<00:01:41.100> the<00:01:41.280> wooden<00:01:41.700> part<00:01:42.060> of<00:01:42.299> it<00:01:42.420> the

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:42.570 
where you want the wooden part of it the

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:44.480 
where you want the wooden part of it the
actual<00:01:42.689> bit<00:01:42.990> that<00:01:43.110> does<00:01:43.259> the<00:01:43.380> pushing<00:01:43.829> so

00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:44.490 
actual bit that does the pushing so

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:45.920 
actual bit that does the pushing so
effectively<00:01:44.939> the<00:01:45.060> piston<00:01:45.420> will<00:01:45.540> be<00:01:45.659> pushing

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:45.930 
effectively the piston will be pushing

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:47.870 
effectively the piston will be pushing
toward<00:01:46.680> you<00:01:46.920> when<00:01:47.040> you<00:01:47.159> place<00:01:47.399> it<00:01:47.640> and<00:01:47.729> if<00:01:47.790> you

00:01:47.870 --> 00:01:47.880 
toward you when you place it and if you

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:49.580 
toward you when you place it and if you
get<00:01:47.970> it<00:01:48.090> wrong<00:01:48.180> just<00:01:48.750> just<00:01:48.960> smash<00:01:49.380> it<00:01:49.409> with

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:49.590 
get it wrong just just smash it with

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:51.679 
get it wrong just just smash it with
something<00:01:50.070> I<00:01:50.310> learn<00:01:50.549> pick<00:01:51.119> it<00:01:51.210> up<00:01:51.299> and<00:01:51.390> replace

00:01:51.679 --> 00:01:51.689 
something I learn pick it up and replace

00:01:51.689 --> 00:01:53.719 
something I learn pick it up and replace
and<00:01:52.290> again<00:01:52.530> the<00:01:52.619> same<00:01:52.799> thing<00:01:53.009> with<00:01:53.130> these<00:01:53.340> so<00:01:53.700> I

00:01:53.719 --> 00:01:53.729 
and again the same thing with these so I

00:01:53.729 --> 00:01:56.660 
and again the same thing with these so I
stood<00:01:54.329> here<00:01:54.600> in<00:01:54.750> the<00:01:54.840> tunnel<00:01:55.140> went<00:01:56.070> up<00:01:56.250> to<00:01:56.520> get

00:01:56.660 --> 00:01:56.670 
stood here in the tunnel went up to get

00:01:56.670 --> 00:01:59.300 
stood here in the tunnel went up to get
those<00:01:56.880> down<00:01:57.450> to<00:01:57.689> put<00:01:57.840> those<00:01:57.990> now<00:01:58.920> the<00:01:58.979> thing<00:01:59.130> to

00:01:59.300 --> 00:01:59.310 
those down to put those now the thing to

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:01.490 
those down to put those now the thing to
remember<00:01:59.430> about<00:01:59.969> these<00:02:00.390> Pistons<00:02:00.960> is<00:02:01.229> that<00:02:01.409> you

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:01.500 
remember about these Pistons is that you

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:02.330 
remember about these Pistons is that you
have<00:02:01.770> to

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:02.340 
have to

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:06.200 
have to
either<00:02:04.280> diodes<00:02:05.280> these<00:02:05.549> little<00:02:05.759> repeaters

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:06.210 
either diodes these little repeaters

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:09.800 
either diodes these little repeaters
come<00:02:06.600> very<00:02:07.049> useful<00:02:08.450> because<00:02:09.450> they're<00:02:09.629> a<00:02:09.660> bit

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:09.810 
come very useful because they're a bit

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:16.100 
come very useful because they're a bit
strange<00:02:10.080> and<00:02:11.069> I'll<00:02:11.250> show<00:02:11.489> you<00:02:11.550> why<00:02:13.099> okay<00:02:15.110> in

00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:16.110 
strange and I'll show you why okay in

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:18.110 
strange and I'll show you why okay in
order<00:02:16.830> for<00:02:17.010> the<00:02:17.099> piston<00:02:17.459> to<00:02:17.550> activate<00:02:17.970> it

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:18.120 
order for the piston to activate it

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:19.640 
order for the piston to activate it
needs<00:02:18.300> a<00:02:18.390> positive<00:02:18.540> signals<00:02:19.110> if<00:02:19.200> I<00:02:19.319> put<00:02:19.530> some

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:19.650 
needs a positive signals if I put some

00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:21.440 
needs a positive signals if I put some
redstone<00:02:19.860> there<00:02:20.280> it<00:02:20.519> pushes<00:02:20.910> up<00:02:21.060> pissed<00:02:21.269> or

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:21.450 
redstone there it pushes up pissed or

00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:23.449 
redstone there it pushes up pissed or
not<00:02:21.569> but<00:02:22.200> I<00:02:22.230> put<00:02:22.410> some<00:02:22.530> rest<00:02:22.709> in<00:02:22.860> there<00:02:23.069> they

00:02:23.449 --> 00:02:23.459 
not but I put some rest in there they

00:02:23.459 --> 00:02:25.160 
not but I put some rest in there they
goes<00:02:24.000> back<00:02:24.209> down<00:02:24.360> again<00:02:24.540> you're<00:02:24.810> thinking<00:02:25.049> why

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:25.170 
goes back down again you're thinking why

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:28.580 
goes back down again you're thinking why
hang<00:02:25.290> on<00:02:25.379> a<00:02:25.470> second<00:02:26.030> surely<00:02:27.260> they<00:02:28.260> should<00:02:28.290> both

00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:28.590 
hang on a second surely they should both

00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:31.610 
hang on a second surely they should both
go<00:02:28.860> up<00:02:28.970> all<00:02:29.970> the<00:02:30.090> thing<00:02:30.299> with<00:02:30.540> these<00:02:30.780> Pistons

00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:31.620 
go up all the thing with these Pistons

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:34.520 
go up all the thing with these Pistons
is<00:02:31.890> that<00:02:32.190> you<00:02:33.000> need<00:02:33.239> to<00:02:33.480> guide<00:02:33.750> the<00:02:34.019> red<00:02:34.230> stone

00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:34.530 
is that you need to guide the red stone

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:37.069 
is that you need to guide the red stone
in<00:02:34.739> a<00:02:34.829> direct<00:02:35.400> straight<00:02:35.819> line<00:02:36.090> into<00:02:36.750> the<00:02:36.900> block

00:02:37.069 --> 00:02:37.079 
in a direct straight line into the block

00:02:37.079 --> 00:02:39.410 
in a direct straight line into the block
for<00:02:37.290> it<00:02:37.380> to<00:02:37.500> work<00:02:37.760> so<00:02:38.760> as<00:02:38.819> you<00:02:38.910> can<00:02:39.000> see<00:02:39.269> when

00:02:39.410 --> 00:02:39.420 
for it to work so as you can see when

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:41.960 
for it to work so as you can see when
there's<00:02:39.599> just<00:02:39.780> one<00:02:40.220> stream<00:02:41.220> of<00:02:41.370> redstone<00:02:41.670> and

00:02:41.960 --> 00:02:41.970 
there's just one stream of redstone and

00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:44.470 
there's just one stream of redstone and
the<00:02:42.480> lines<00:02:42.660> going<00:02:42.900> to<00:02:43.019> wrap<00:02:43.170> into<00:02:43.380> it<00:02:43.530> it<00:02:43.620> works

00:02:44.470 --> 00:02:44.480 
the lines going to wrap into it it works

00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:47.089 
the lines going to wrap into it it works
if<00:02:45.480> that<00:02:45.720> one's<00:02:45.930> going<00:02:46.590> directly<00:02:46.829> into<00:02:46.890> it

00:02:47.089 --> 00:02:47.099 
if that one's going directly into it

00:02:47.099 --> 00:02:50.059 
if that one's going directly into it
works<00:02:47.599> but<00:02:48.599> the<00:02:48.870> problem<00:02:49.079> you've<00:02:49.349> guys<00:02:49.620> when

00:02:50.059 --> 00:02:50.069 
works but the problem you've guys when

00:02:50.069 --> 00:02:52.520 
works but the problem you've guys when
you<00:02:50.220> put<00:02:50.519> two<00:02:51.390> bits<00:02:51.750> of<00:02:51.900> redstone<00:02:52.200> down<00:02:52.410> it

00:02:52.520 --> 00:02:52.530 
you put two bits of redstone down it

00:02:52.530 --> 00:02:54.800 
you put two bits of redstone down it
sort<00:02:52.709> of<00:02:52.739> formed<00:02:53.040> this<00:02:53.129> square<00:02:53.610> none<00:02:54.540> of<00:02:54.690> them

00:02:54.800 --> 00:02:54.810 
sort of formed this square none of them

00:02:54.810 --> 00:02:56.479 
sort of formed this square none of them
are<00:02:54.930> going<00:02:55.140> directly<00:02:55.440> in<00:02:55.739> so<00:02:56.040> it's<00:02:56.160> a<00:02:56.220> bit<00:02:56.340> of<00:02:56.430> a

00:02:56.479 --> 00:02:56.489 
are going directly in so it's a bit of a

00:02:56.489 --> 00:02:58.670 
are going directly in so it's a bit of a
tricky<00:02:56.730> one<00:02:56.940> so<00:02:57.750> what<00:02:57.900> you<00:02:57.989> do<00:02:58.110> to<00:02:58.290> get<00:02:58.440> round

00:02:58.670 --> 00:02:58.680 
tricky one so what you do to get round

00:02:58.680 --> 00:03:00.650 
tricky one so what you do to get round
that<00:02:58.799> is<00:02:59.099> either<00:02:59.370> you<00:02:59.640> could<00:02:59.819> do<00:02:59.910> a<00:02:59.940> roundabout

00:03:00.650 --> 00:03:00.660 
that is either you could do a roundabout

00:03:00.660 --> 00:03:02.330 
that is either you could do a roundabout
route<00:03:01.170> that<00:03:01.560> comes<00:03:01.739> in<00:03:01.890> from<00:03:02.040> a<00:03:02.069> different

00:03:02.330 --> 00:03:02.340 
route that comes in from a different

00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:07.280 
route that comes in from a different
angle<00:03:02.900> or<00:03:04.099> to<00:03:05.099> make<00:03:05.280> things<00:03:05.489> easier<00:03:06.260> put<00:03:07.260> a

00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:07.290 
angle or to make things easier put a

00:03:07.290 --> 00:03:12.140 
angle or to make things easier put a
paradise<00:03:07.680> for<00:03:07.920> a<00:03:08.250> pair<00:03:09.030> of<00:03:09.150> repeaters<00:03:09.510> um<00:03:11.150> so

00:03:12.140 --> 00:03:12.150 
paradise for a pair of repeaters um so

00:03:12.150 --> 00:03:13.789 
paradise for a pair of repeaters um so
yeah<00:03:12.359> that's<00:03:12.780> that's<00:03:13.170> how<00:03:13.410> you<00:03:13.470> do<00:03:13.650> it<00:03:13.680> because

00:03:13.789 --> 00:03:13.799 
yeah that's that's how you do it because

00:03:13.799 --> 00:03:15.620 
yeah that's that's how you do it because
that<00:03:13.950> then<00:03:14.190> sort<00:03:14.370> of<00:03:14.400> pushes<00:03:14.880> the<00:03:15.060> charge<00:03:15.329> in<00:03:15.540> a

00:03:15.620 --> 00:03:15.630 
that then sort of pushes the charge in a

00:03:15.630 --> 00:03:17.000 
that then sort of pushes the charge in a
straight<00:03:15.930> line<00:03:15.959> directly<00:03:16.440> in<00:03:16.590> and<00:03:16.739> it<00:03:16.829> makes

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:17.010 
straight line directly in and it makes

00:03:17.010 --> 00:03:23.620 
straight line directly in and it makes
it<00:03:17.130> work<00:03:17.370> so<00:03:17.639> yeah<00:03:17.849> it's<00:03:18.200> always<00:03:19.200> very<00:03:19.290> useful

00:03:23.620 --> 00:03:23.630 

00:03:23.630 --> 00:03:26.420 

it's<00:03:24.630> going<00:03:24.780> to<00:03:24.810> destroy<00:03:25.230> all<00:03:25.380> of<00:03:25.530> those<00:03:25.650> let's

00:03:26.420 --> 00:03:26.430 
it's going to destroy all of those let's

00:03:26.430 --> 00:03:28.009 
it's going to destroy all of those let's
say<00:03:26.519> I<00:03:26.549> under<00:03:26.849> strike<00:03:27.060> one<00:03:27.269> site<00:03:27.480> it<00:03:27.660> doesn't

00:03:28.009 --> 00:03:28.019 
say I under strike one site it doesn't

00:03:28.019 --> 00:03:30.349 
say I under strike one site it doesn't
matter<00:03:28.139> if<00:03:28.260> it's<00:03:28.319> open<00:03:28.530> or<00:03:28.829> closed<00:03:29.150> now<00:03:30.150> what

00:03:30.349 --> 00:03:30.359 
matter if it's open or closed now what

00:03:30.359 --> 00:03:32.150 
matter if it's open or closed now what
actually<00:03:30.690> happens<00:03:30.959> is<00:03:31.049> really<00:03:31.380> simple<00:03:31.650> that

00:03:32.150 --> 00:03:32.160 
actually happens is really simple that

00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:34.699 
actually happens is really simple that
lever<00:03:33.079> transmits<00:03:34.079> a<00:03:34.200> signal<00:03:34.230> to<00:03:34.530> this

00:03:34.699 --> 00:03:34.709 
lever transmits a signal to this

00:03:34.709 --> 00:03:37.159 
lever transmits a signal to this
redstone<00:03:35.099> one<00:03:36.000> set<00:03:36.239> of<00:03:36.329> redstone<00:03:36.599> goes<00:03:36.959> up

00:03:37.159 --> 00:03:37.169 
redstone one set of redstone goes up

00:03:37.169 --> 00:03:39.470 
redstone one set of redstone goes up
into<00:03:37.349> repeaters<00:03:37.919> for<00:03:38.130> the<00:03:38.190> top<00:03:38.400> two<00:03:38.639> and<00:03:39.060> one

00:03:39.470 --> 00:03:39.480 
into repeaters for the top two and one

00:03:39.480 --> 00:03:42.770 
into repeaters for the top two and one
set<00:03:39.750> goes<00:03:39.959> down<00:03:40.260> underneath<00:03:41.220> and<00:03:41.780> powers

00:03:42.770 --> 00:03:42.780 
set goes down underneath and powers

00:03:42.780 --> 00:03:46.069 
set goes down underneath and powers
these<00:03:43.019> two<00:03:43.260> it's<00:03:44.010> actually<00:03:44.340> that<00:03:44.639> simple<00:03:45.180> not

00:03:46.069 --> 00:03:46.079 
these two it's actually that simple not

00:03:46.079 --> 00:03:48.740 
these two it's actually that simple not
not<00:03:46.650> complicated<00:03:47.400> at<00:03:47.459> all<00:03:47.579> and<00:03:48.030> but<00:03:48.510> it<00:03:48.599> just

00:03:48.740 --> 00:03:48.750 
not complicated at all and but it just

00:03:48.750 --> 00:03:50.629 
not complicated at all and but it just
you<00:03:49.139> know<00:03:49.260> it's<00:03:49.410> a<00:03:49.470> simple<00:03:49.919> little<00:03:50.069> door<00:03:50.370> not

00:03:50.629 --> 00:03:50.639 
you know it's a simple little door not

00:03:50.639 --> 00:03:52.759 
you know it's a simple little door not
as<00:03:50.730> complicated<00:03:51.060> as<00:03:51.450> the<00:03:51.569> JED<00:03:51.780> one<00:03:51.989> certainly

00:03:52.759 --> 00:03:52.769 
as complicated as the JED one certainly

00:03:52.769 --> 00:03:54.080 
as complicated as the JED one certainly
you<00:03:52.950> could<00:03:53.069> make<00:03:53.280> it<00:03:53.400> a<00:03:53.459> bit<00:03:53.609> more<00:03:53.639> interesting

00:03:54.080 --> 00:03:54.090 
you could make it a bit more interesting

00:03:54.090 --> 00:03:57.170 
you could make it a bit more interesting
I<00:03:54.480> mean<00:03:54.599> you<00:03:54.720> could<00:03:54.989> actually<00:03:55.169> in<00:03:55.680> theory<00:03:56.180> if

00:03:57.170 --> 00:03:57.180 
I mean you could actually in theory if

00:03:57.180 --> 00:03:59.000 
I mean you could actually in theory if
you<00:03:57.780> wanted<00:03:58.139> to<00:03:58.230> make<00:03:58.349> the<00:03:58.470> door<00:03:58.650> a<00:03:58.680> little<00:03:58.709> bit

00:03:59.000 --> 00:03:59.010 
you wanted to make the door a little bit

00:03:59.010 --> 00:04:01.909 
you wanted to make the door a little bit
more<00:03:59.160> interesting<00:03:59.569> you<00:04:00.569> could<00:04:00.900> make<00:04:01.109> it<00:04:01.380> so<00:04:01.560> is

00:04:01.909 --> 00:04:01.919 
more interesting you could make it so is

00:04:01.919 --> 00:04:04.370 
more interesting you could make it so is
literally<00:04:02.430> glass<00:04:03.329> on<00:04:03.510> the<00:04:03.540> top<00:04:03.780> that's<00:04:03.959> 10<00:04:04.290> on

00:04:04.370 --> 00:04:04.380 
literally glass on the top that's 10 on

00:04:04.380 --> 00:04:05.900 
literally glass on the top that's 10 on
the<00:04:04.410> bottom<00:04:04.709> they<00:04:04.980> actually<00:04:05.340> be<00:04:05.430> quite<00:04:05.579> cool

00:04:05.900 --> 00:04:05.910 
the bottom they actually be quite cool

00:04:05.910 --> 00:04:09.110 
the bottom they actually be quite cool
little<00:04:06.299> door<00:04:06.569> and<00:04:07.519> will<00:04:08.519> you<00:04:08.609> commit<00:04:08.819> button

00:04:09.110 --> 00:04:09.120 
little door and will you commit button

00:04:09.120 --> 00:04:12.709 
little door and will you commit button
not<00:04:09.389> metal<00:04:09.780> like<00:04:10.260> a<00:04:10.290> futuristic<00:04:11.150> Star<00:04:12.150> Trek

00:04:12.709 --> 00:04:12.719 
not metal like a futuristic Star Trek

00:04:12.719 --> 00:04:14.120 
not metal like a futuristic Star Trek
type<00:04:12.989> door

00:04:14.120 --> 00:04:14.130 
type door

00:04:14.130 --> 00:04:16.699 
type door
and<00:04:14.270> you<00:04:15.270> could<00:04:15.480> also<00:04:15.630> do<00:04:15.930> exactly<00:04:16.320> the<00:04:16.680> same

00:04:16.699 --> 00:04:16.709 
and you could also do exactly the same

00:04:16.709 --> 00:04:18.890 
and you could also do exactly the same
thing<00:04:16.920> sideways<00:04:17.760> it<00:04:18.300> might<00:04:18.450> be<00:04:18.540> a<00:04:18.600> bit<00:04:18.720> tricky

00:04:18.890 --> 00:04:18.900 
thing sideways it might be a bit tricky

00:04:18.900 --> 00:04:20.920 
thing sideways it might be a bit tricky
to<00:04:19.110> get<00:04:19.350> the<00:04:19.470> signals<00:04:19.860> into<00:04:20.160> the<00:04:20.280> Pistons

00:04:20.920 --> 00:04:20.930 
to get the signals into the Pistons

00:04:20.930 --> 00:04:23.720 
to get the signals into the Pistons
you'd<00:04:21.930> have<00:04:22.080> to<00:04:22.170> come<00:04:22.290> say<00:04:22.920> one<00:04:23.340> from<00:04:23.580> this

00:04:23.720 --> 00:04:23.730 
you'd have to come say one from this

00:04:23.730 --> 00:04:24.980 
you'd have to come say one from this
side<00:04:24.000> the<00:04:24.150> bottom<00:04:24.360> one<00:04:24.450> from<00:04:24.570> that<00:04:24.600> from<00:04:24.840> the

00:04:24.980 --> 00:04:24.990 
side the bottom one from that from the

00:04:24.990 --> 00:04:26.720 
side the bottom one from that from the
top<00:04:25.110> one<00:04:25.290> from<00:04:25.440> this<00:04:25.560> side<00:04:25.830> and<00:04:26.070> you<00:04:26.460> could<00:04:26.610> do

00:04:26.720 --> 00:04:26.730 
top one from this side and you could do

00:04:26.730 --> 00:04:28.280 
top one from this side and you could do
it<00:04:26.880> and<00:04:27.000> then<00:04:27.150> they<00:04:27.270> could<00:04:27.330> open<00:04:27.990> up<00:04:28.050> like<00:04:28.230> a

00:04:28.280 --> 00:04:28.290 
it and then they could open up like a

00:04:28.290 --> 00:04:33.350 
it and then they could open up like a
like<00:04:28.920> a<00:04:28.950> sliding<00:04:29.370> door<00:04:29.660> away<00:04:30.980> cows<00:04:32.210> ruining<00:04:33.210> my

00:04:33.350 --> 00:04:33.360 
like a sliding door away cows ruining my

00:04:33.360 --> 00:04:36.170 
like a sliding door away cows ruining my
demonstration<00:04:34.580> so<00:04:35.580> that's<00:04:35.760> pretty<00:04:35.970> much<00:04:36.060> it

00:04:36.170 --> 00:04:36.180 
demonstration so that's pretty much it

00:04:36.180 --> 00:04:38.630 
demonstration so that's pretty much it
really<00:04:36.600> it's<00:04:37.140> not<00:04:37.410> a<00:04:37.620> complicated<00:04:38.010> thing<00:04:38.250> that

00:04:38.630 --> 00:04:38.640 
really it's not a complicated thing that

00:04:38.640 --> 00:04:39.770 
really it's not a complicated thing that
just<00:04:38.790> gives<00:04:38.940> you<00:04:39.060> an<00:04:39.180> idea<00:04:39.270> of<00:04:39.540> what<00:04:39.600> you<00:04:39.750> can

00:04:39.770 --> 00:04:39.780 
just gives you an idea of what you can

00:04:39.780 --> 00:04:41.840 
just gives you an idea of what you can
do<00:04:40.170> with<00:04:40.380> histon<00:04:40.740> i'll<00:04:41.370> be<00:04:41.490> doing<00:04:41.610> more

00:04:41.840 --> 00:04:41.850 
do with histon i'll be doing more

00:04:41.850 --> 00:04:44.510 
do with histon i'll be doing more
complicate<00:04:42.450> stuff<00:04:42.480> later<00:04:42.930> but<00:04:43.830> yeah<00:04:44.010> as<00:04:44.340> far

00:04:44.510 --> 00:04:44.520 
complicate stuff later but yeah as far

00:04:44.520 --> 00:04:47.360 
complicate stuff later but yeah as far
as<00:04:44.670> a<00:04:44.700> demonstration<00:04:45.540> goes<00:04:46.190> that's<00:04:47.190> your

00:04:47.360 --> 00:04:47.370 
as a demonstration goes that's your

00:04:47.370 --> 00:04:51.500 
as a demonstration goes that's your
basic<00:04:47.520> sort<00:04:47.970> of<00:04:48.030> piston<00:04:48.420> setup<00:04:49.370> so<00:04:50.370> yes<00:04:50.550> that's

00:04:51.500 --> 00:04:51.510 
basic sort of piston setup so yes that's

00:04:51.510 --> 00:05:00.490 
basic sort of piston setup so yes that's
it<00:04:51.690> your<00:04:52.320> own<00:04:52.440> little<00:04:52.730> piston<00:04:53.730> door<00:04:59.330> mmm

00:05:00.490 --> 00:05:00.500 
it your own little piston door mmm

00:05:00.500 --> 00:05:07.090 
it your own little piston door mmm
that'll<00:05:01.500> be<00:05:01.590> a<00:05:01.700> now<00:05:02.700> I'm<00:05:02.850> stuck<00:05:03.240> ah<00:05:04.580> then<00:05:05.900> hope

00:05:07.090 --> 00:05:07.100 
that'll be a now I'm stuck ah then hope

00:05:07.100 --> 00:05:11.600 
that'll be a now I'm stuck ah then hope
hello<00:05:08.600> anybody
