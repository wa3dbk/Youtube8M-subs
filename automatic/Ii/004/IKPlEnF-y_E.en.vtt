00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:40.710
 that I downloaded my pc here that worked 

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:42.960
 It was perfectly the same here tomb 

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:46.140

 I'm not mistaken, it's 13 is 9.35 gb of 

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:57.230
 his size I'm going to stop here 

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:05.040
 after not finishing downloading the game 

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:07.530
 There you have to find your game. 

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:09.930
 then what also radio folder will have a 

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:12.210
 iso format you will be scrolling and 

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:13.560
 program can be for example with the dae 

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:15.390
 light monster 

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:18.780
 You've always seen my channel and 

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:20.310
 using is after having done inflation 

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:26.750
 let me do an action that is not in the 

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:26.750
 side here we will create the virtual folder 

00:01:26.869 --> 00:01:33.650
 well here the game is already regulated 

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:33.650
 you will click here in the setup 

00:01:34.909 --> 00:01:40.170
 here you will click next goes 

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:42.119
 select the directory you want and 

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:44.670
 going to install will follow the steps until the 

00:01:42.119 --> 00:01:46.979
 end and I will not be there because because 

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:48.090
 I have the original version of this game and 

00:01:46.979 --> 00:01:50.909
 in my computer 

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:53.250
 however the settings you will have 

00:01:50.909 --> 00:01:54.899
 to do with the control is the same both 

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:57.829
 for the original game and for the game 

00:01:54.899 --> 00:02:00.390
 celtic pirate 

00:01:57.829 --> 00:02:02.159
 after you have done the installation you will have 

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:05.640
 who plays your game you will fall 

00:02:02.159 --> 00:02:08.640
 in this folder that the style is copied 

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:11.430
 these files here copy this 

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:12.600
 file you go there in the folder where you were 

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:14.610
 executed 

00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:16.950
 the folder you selected at the time 

00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:19.530
 installation disk and will paste those 

00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:22.170
 three files here inside the folder 

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:24.060
 done that your game is already installed 

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:25.560
 and cracked which is the next step 

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:27.540
 now the next step is to configure 

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:29.910
 control but just want to show 

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:30.810
 Here you have the original game in the 

00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:32.700
 steam 

00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:34.650
 He's at a great price now. 

00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:36.750
 it's already a little more expensive it's costing 

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:39.150
 R $ 17 50 cents 

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:41.160
 I bought the game a promotion that had 

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:43.230
 here for $ 12 

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:46.440
 so I believe that for anyone and 

00:02:43.230 --> 00:02:48.270
 12 reais is not a value that will weigh on the 

00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:49.710
 your pocket and fix it by playing a 

00:02:48.270 --> 00:02:52.130
 original game 

00:02:49.710 --> 00:02:55.250
 so let 's set up the control 

00:02:52.130 --> 00:02:57.750
 Let's know that the folder 

00:02:55.250 --> 00:02:59.280
 You are seeing here in here here. 

00:02:57.750 --> 00:03:02.730
 and in here does not have an executable 

00:02:59.280 --> 00:03:05.010
 emulator only have these articles here tsx 

00:03:02.730 --> 00:03:07.800
 time and have these other 

00:03:05.010 --> 00:03:09.620
 articles here the executable that would be this 

00:03:07.800 --> 00:03:15.420
 Here, let me show you here. 

00:03:09.620 --> 00:03:17.460
 open another any Here and 

00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:19.950
 executed that there is no such folder there 

00:03:17.460 --> 00:03:23.070
 so we're going to need only 

00:03:19.950 --> 00:03:25.350
 of these files that you are here 

00:03:23.070 --> 00:03:28.290

00:03:36.900 --> 00:03:41.940
