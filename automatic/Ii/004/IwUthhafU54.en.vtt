really<00:04:08.160> unique<00:04:08.459> the<00:04:09.090> problem<00:04:09.389> is<00:04:09.480> is<00:04:09.660> that

00:04:09.680 --> 00:04:09.690 
really unique the problem is is that

00:04:09.690 --> 00:04:11.990 
really unique the problem is is that
you'll<00:04:10.470> go<00:04:10.680> to<00:04:10.739> this<00:04:10.919> new<00:04:11.130> map<00:04:11.400> all<00:04:11.849> your

00:04:11.990 --> 00:04:12.000 
you'll go to this new map all your

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:13.280 
you'll go to this new map all your
fingers<00:04:12.209> a<00:04:12.389> new<00:04:12.510> map<00:04:12.690> and<00:04:12.870> you'll<00:04:12.959> go<00:04:13.079> for<00:04:13.200> his

00:04:13.280 --> 00:04:13.290 
fingers a new map and you'll go for his

00:04:13.290 --> 00:04:15.199 
fingers a new map and you'll go for his
warehouse<00:04:13.680> and<00:04:13.859> your<00:04:13.950> finger<00:04:14.220> self<00:04:14.459> I've<00:04:14.940> been

00:04:15.199 --> 00:04:15.209 
warehouse and your finger self I've been

00:04:15.209 --> 00:04:16.580 
warehouse and your finger self I've been
here<00:04:15.389> before<00:04:15.540> and<00:04:15.780> then<00:04:16.049> you'll<00:04:16.169> come<00:04:16.320> out<00:04:16.440> and

00:04:16.580 --> 00:04:16.590 
here before and then you'll come out and

00:04:16.590 --> 00:04:17.449 
here before and then you'll come out and
you'll<00:04:16.680> see<00:04:16.799> it's<00:04:16.889> completely<00:04:17.340> different

00:04:17.449 --> 00:04:17.459 
you'll see it's completely different

00:04:17.459 --> 00:04:20.539 
you'll see it's completely different
it's<00:04:17.789> a<00:04:17.880> cool<00:04:18.120> idea<00:04:18.150> for<00:04:18.900> a<00:04:19.470> map<00:04:19.769> voting<00:04:20.160> system

00:04:20.539 --> 00:04:20.549 
it's a cool idea for a map voting system

00:04:20.549 --> 00:04:22.580 
it's a cool idea for a map voting system
and<00:04:20.669> its<00:04:20.789> kind<00:04:20.940> of<00:04:21.030> dramatic<00:04:21.510> and<00:04:21.810> I<00:04:22.019> like<00:04:22.470> how

00:04:22.580 --> 00:04:22.590 
and its kind of dramatic and I like how

00:04:22.590 --> 00:04:24.260 
and its kind of dramatic and I like how
so<00:04:22.830> many<00:04:22.919> combinations<00:04:23.250> but<00:04:23.760> you're<00:04:23.880> bound<00:04:24.120> to

00:04:24.260 --> 00:04:24.270 
so many combinations but you're bound to

00:04:24.270 --> 00:04:25.820 
so many combinations but you're bound to
see<00:04:24.300> the<00:04:24.539> same<00:04:24.720> environment<00:04:25.229> again<00:04:25.470> again

00:04:25.820 --> 00:04:25.830 
see the same environment again again

00:04:25.830 --> 00:04:27.740 
see the same environment again again
that's<00:04:26.159> that's<00:04:26.880> the<00:04:26.970> downside<00:04:27.180> of<00:04:27.479> the

00:04:27.740 --> 00:04:27.750 
that's that's the downside of the

00:04:27.750 --> 00:04:30.140 
that's that's the downside of the
sound-wise<00:04:28.740> it<00:04:29.160> works<00:04:29.340> fine<00:04:29.610> it's<00:04:29.880> a<00:04:29.940> little

00:04:30.140 --> 00:04:30.150 
sound-wise it works fine it's a little

00:04:30.150 --> 00:04:32.570 
sound-wise it works fine it's a little
generic<00:04:30.480> but<00:04:31.170> when<00:04:31.320> do<00:04:31.410> your<00:04:31.530> headshots<00:04:32.010> its

00:04:32.570 --> 00:04:32.580 
generic but when do your headshots its

00:04:32.580 --> 00:04:34.190 
generic but when do your headshots its
just<00:04:32.790> oh<00:04:32.880> so<00:04:32.970> satisfying<00:04:33.390> to<00:04:33.720> hear<00:04:33.870> that<00:04:33.960> great

00:04:34.190 --> 00:04:34.200 
just oh so satisfying to hear that great

00:04:34.200 --> 00:04:36.110 
just oh so satisfying to hear that great
big<00:04:34.350> pop<00:04:34.740> when<00:04:34.980> you<00:04:35.070> kill<00:04:35.250> someone<00:04:35.490> getting

00:04:36.110 --> 00:04:36.120 
big pop when you kill someone getting

00:04:36.120 --> 00:04:38.000 
big pop when you kill someone getting
killed<00:04:36.210> grenade<00:04:36.780> this<00:04:36.990> too<00:04:37.230> but<00:04:37.830> what<00:04:37.980> I

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:38.010 
killed grenade this too but what I

00:04:38.010 --> 00:04:39.620 
killed grenade this too but what I
really<00:04:38.280> like<00:04:38.460> is<00:04:38.490> how<00:04:38.790> you<00:04:38.850> can<00:04:39.090> hit<00:04:39.210> gunfights

00:04:39.620 --> 00:04:39.630 
really like is how you can hit gunfights

00:04:39.630 --> 00:04:41.480 
really like is how you can hit gunfights
from<00:04:39.780> afar<00:04:40.050> you<00:04:40.320> can<00:04:40.440> be<00:04:40.590> able<00:04:40.980> to<00:04:41.130> pinpoint

00:04:41.480 --> 00:04:41.490 
from afar you can be able to pinpoint

00:04:41.490 --> 00:04:43.430 
from afar you can be able to pinpoint
always<00:04:42.300> exactly<00:04:42.750> where<00:04:42.960> the<00:04:43.050> action<00:04:43.350> is

00:04:43.430 --> 00:04:43.440 
always exactly where the action is

00:04:43.440 --> 00:04:45.140 
always exactly where the action is
happening<00:04:43.590> I'm<00:04:44.010> not<00:04:44.160> sure<00:04:44.220> how<00:04:44.550> they<00:04:44.790> did<00:04:45.000> that

00:04:45.140 --> 00:04:45.150 
happening I'm not sure how they did that

00:04:45.150 --> 00:04:47.300 
happening I'm not sure how they did that
but<00:04:45.390> it<00:04:45.540> just<00:04:45.690> seems<00:04:45.900> to<00:04:46.050> work<00:04:46.320> really<00:04:46.620> well<00:04:47.070> in

00:04:47.300 --> 00:04:47.310 
but it just seems to work really well in

00:04:47.310 --> 00:04:48.770 
but it just seems to work really well in
this<00:04:47.460> game<00:04:47.670> but<00:04:48.120> if<00:04:48.180> I<00:04:48.300> was<00:04:48.450> to<00:04:48.510> give<00:04:48.630> my
