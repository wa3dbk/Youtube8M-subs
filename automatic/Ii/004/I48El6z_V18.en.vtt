distance but lower so i can give you
guys<00:00:14.070> the<00:00:14.280> higher<00:00:14.429> frame<00:00:14.730> rate<00:00:15.350> alright<00:00:16.350> so

00:00:16.730 --> 00:00:16.740 
guys the higher frame rate alright so

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:20.330 
guys the higher frame rate alright so
this<00:00:17.279> is<00:00:17.490> the<00:00:17.699> block<00:00:18.000> switcher<00:00:18.920> you<00:00:19.920> push<00:00:20.189> this

00:00:20.330 --> 00:00:20.340 
this is the block switcher you push this

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:25.519 
this is the block switcher you push this
button<00:00:20.580> and<00:00:22.310> the<00:00:23.310> block<00:00:23.930> magically<00:00:24.930> changes

00:00:25.519 --> 00:00:25.529 
button and the block magically changes

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:28.939 
button and the block magically changes
from<00:00:26.359> diamond<00:00:27.359> to<00:00:27.900> dirt<00:00:28.140> but<00:00:28.470> I<00:00:28.500> want<00:00:28.769> my

00:00:28.939 --> 00:00:28.949 
from diamond to dirt but I want my

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:32.630 
from diamond to dirt but I want my
diamond<00:00:29.429> back<00:00:29.699> so<00:00:30.029> can<00:00:30.960> switch<00:00:31.170> again<00:00:31.640> just

00:00:32.630 --> 00:00:32.640 
diamond back so can switch again just

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:37.670 
diamond back so can switch again just
keep<00:00:32.820> doing<00:00:33.000> this<00:00:33.710> now<00:00:35.719> this<00:00:36.719> is<00:00:36.899> all<00:00:37.079> cool<00:00:37.320> but

00:00:38.810 --> 00:00:38.820 
you guys probably want to see how this

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:41.660 
you guys probably want to see how this
works<00:00:39.530> so<00:00:40.530> let's<00:00:40.770> go<00:00:40.950> over<00:00:40.980> here<00:00:41.309> and<00:00:41.370> I<00:00:41.550> have<00:00:41.640> a

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:41.670 
works so let's go over here and I have a

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:48.290 
works so let's go over here and I have a
bit<00:00:41.879> more<00:00:41.910> of<00:00:42.059> a<00:00:42.180> stripped<00:00:42.450> down<00:00:42.510> version<00:00:47.300> so

00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:48.300 
bit more of a stripped down version so

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:50.330 
bit more of a stripped down version so
as<00:00:48.420> you<00:00:48.510> can<00:00:48.629> see<00:00:48.840> the<00:00:48.960> block<00:00:49.200> is<00:00:49.440> switching

00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:50.340 
as you can see the block is switching

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:58.720 
as you can see the block is switching
and<00:00:50.930> the<00:00:51.930> pistons<00:00:52.350> are<00:00:52.500> just<00:00:52.680> there<00:00:52.860> for<00:00:52.890> show

00:00:58.720 --> 00:00:58.730 

00:00:58.730 --> 00:01:01.580 

so<00:00:59.730> we<00:01:00.059> switch<00:01:00.270> it<00:01:00.420> again<00:01:00.629> alright<00:01:01.199> so<00:01:01.469> let's

00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:01.590 
so we switch it again alright so let's

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:03.080 
so we switch it again alright so let's
go<00:01:01.739> over<00:01:01.770> here<00:01:02.100> now<00:01:02.309> and<00:01:02.550> I<00:01:02.670> want<00:01:02.820> to<00:01:02.940> show<00:01:03.030> you

00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:24.990 
is how you do it with redstone so what

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:27.520 
is how you do it with redstone so what
you<00:01:25.140> have<00:01:25.170> to<00:01:25.290> do<00:01:25.530> is<00:01:25.680> you<00:01:25.770> have<00:01:25.799> to<00:01:25.979> build<00:01:26.130> a

00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:27.530 
you have to do is you have to build a

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:30.530 
you have to do is you have to build a
funky<00:01:28.530> system<00:01:28.950> kind<00:01:29.340> of<00:01:29.400> like<00:01:29.520> this<00:01:29.759> there's<00:01:30.479> a

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:30.540 
funky system kind of like this there's a

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:32.120 
funky system kind of like this there's a
sticky<00:01:30.810> there's<00:01:31.110> a<00:01:31.200> regular<00:01:31.680> piston<00:01:31.950> here

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:32.130 
sticky there's a regular piston here

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:34.429 
sticky there's a regular piston here
sticky<00:01:32.520> piston<00:01:32.850> here<00:01:33.180> regular<00:01:34.020> piston<00:01:34.320> here

00:01:34.429 --> 00:01:34.439 
sticky piston here regular piston here

00:01:34.439 --> 00:01:37.340 
sticky piston here regular piston here
sticky<00:01:34.799> piston<00:01:35.159> here<00:01:35.490> and<00:01:35.700> this<00:01:36.509> poles<00:01:36.900> and

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:37.350 
sticky piston here and this poles and

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:40.130 
sticky piston here and this poles and
this<00:01:38.220> pushes<00:01:38.700> and<00:01:39.030> then<00:01:39.299> this<00:01:39.450> pushes<00:01:39.810> up<00:01:39.990> and

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:40.140 
this pushes and then this pushes up and

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:42.080 
this pushes and then this pushes up and
then<00:01:40.290> this<00:01:40.470> last<00:01:40.950> piston<00:01:41.430> pulls<00:01:41.670> down<00:01:41.820> at<00:01:41.970> the

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:42.090 
then this last piston pulls down at the

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:44.179 
then this last piston pulls down at the
last<00:01:42.299> possible<00:01:42.540> second<00:01:43.200> I'll<00:01:43.649> see<00:01:43.860> if<00:01:43.950> I<00:01:44.009> can

00:01:44.179 --> 00:01:44.189 
last possible second I'll see if I can

00:01:44.189 --> 00:01:50.810 
last possible second I'll see if I can
get<00:01:44.399> a<00:01:44.460> good<00:01:44.640> view<00:01:44.880> of<00:01:45.030> that<00:01:48.350> so<00:01:49.399> to<00:01:50.399> build<00:01:50.610> this

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:50.820 
get a good view of that so to build this

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:54.289 
get a good view of that so to build this
it's<00:01:51.509> pretty<00:01:51.780> simple<00:01:52.159> this<00:01:53.159> one<00:01:53.490> I'll<00:01:53.880> do<00:01:54.270> a

00:01:54.289 --> 00:01:54.299 
it's pretty simple this one I'll do a

00:01:54.299 --> 00:01:59.719 
it's pretty simple this one I'll do a
full<00:01:54.390> tutorial<00:01:55.200> on<00:01:55.350> if<00:01:55.560> you<00:01:55.680> guys<00:01:55.860> want<00:01:56.219> it<00:01:58.729> you

00:01:59.719 --> 00:01:59.729 
full tutorial on if you guys want it you

00:01:59.729 --> 00:02:04.459 
full tutorial on if you guys want it you
have<00:01:59.759> three<00:02:00.240> Pistons<00:02:00.689> here<00:02:01.700> for<00:02:02.700> ticks<00:02:03.200> all<00:02:04.200> on

00:02:04.459 --> 00:02:04.469 
have three Pistons here for ticks all on

00:02:04.469 --> 00:02:06.760 
have three Pistons here for ticks all on
full<00:02:04.710> delay<00:02:04.979> so<00:02:05.040> that's<00:02:05.340> twelve<00:02:05.640> ticks<00:02:05.820> in

00:02:06.760 --> 00:02:06.770 
full delay so that's twelve ticks in

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:09.850 
full delay so that's twelve ticks in
seven<00:02:07.770> tix<00:02:08.009> right<00:02:08.280> here<00:02:08.700> then<00:02:09.330> you<00:02:09.450> have<00:02:09.629> a

00:02:09.850 --> 00:02:09.860 
seven tix right here then you have a

00:02:09.860 --> 00:02:13.100 
seven tix right here then you have a
repeater<00:02:10.860> to<00:02:11.039> get<00:02:11.190> this<00:02:11.340> all<00:02:11.970> the<00:02:12.090> way<00:02:12.120> around

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:13.110 
repeater to get this all the way around

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:15.950 
repeater to get this all the way around
no<00:02:13.380> repeaters<00:02:14.370> here<00:02:14.700> and<00:02:14.940> then<00:02:15.060> another<00:02:15.240> seven

00:02:15.950 --> 00:02:15.960 
no repeaters here and then another seven

00:02:15.960 --> 00:02:24.980 
no repeaters here and then another seven
tix<00:02:16.260> right<00:02:16.650> here<00:02:20.810> so<00:02:23.420> that's<00:02:24.420> pretty<00:02:24.690> much<00:02:24.840> how

00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:24.990 
tix right here so that's pretty much how

00:02:24.990 --> 00:02:29.540 
tix right here so that's pretty much how
this<00:02:25.140> works<00:02:25.380> um<00:02:25.710> I'm<00:02:26.370> give<00:02:27.090> me<00:02:27.270> TNT<00:02:27.750> and<00:02:28.550> this
