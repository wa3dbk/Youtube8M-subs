hair-raising stuff on this record if you

00:03:22.980 --> 00:03:25.160 
hair-raising stuff on this record if you
thought<00:03:23.190> the<00:03:23.370> sounds<00:03:24.150> and<00:03:24.299> the<00:03:24.390> performance

00:03:25.160 --> 00:03:25.170 
thought the sounds and the performance

00:03:25.170 --> 00:03:26.840 
thought the sounds and the performance

twisted reading into what is being said
on<00:03:29.850> this<00:03:30.120> album<00:03:30.359> is<00:03:30.750> even<00:03:31.350> more<00:03:31.560> disturbing

00:03:32.210 --> 00:03:32.220 
on this album is even more disturbing

00:03:32.220 --> 00:03:34.460 
on this album is even more disturbing
overall<00:03:32.760> I<00:03:32.790> did<00:03:32.940> like<00:03:33.299> this<00:03:33.510> record<00:03:33.989> but<00:03:34.230> I

00:03:34.460 --> 00:03:34.470 
overall I did like this record but I

00:03:34.470 --> 00:03:36.949 
overall I did like this record but I
still<00:03:35.069> kind<00:03:35.459> of<00:03:35.579> felt<00:03:35.760> like<00:03:35.880> I<00:03:36.060> got<00:03:36.269> more<00:03:36.600> of

00:03:36.949 --> 00:03:36.959 
still kind of felt like I got more of

00:03:36.959 --> 00:03:39.410 
still kind of felt like I got more of
the<00:03:36.989> same<00:03:37.140> in<00:03:37.799> terms<00:03:38.370> of<00:03:38.549> what<00:03:38.730> the<00:03:39.060> band<00:03:39.239> did

00:03:39.410 --> 00:03:39.420 
the same in terms of what the band did
