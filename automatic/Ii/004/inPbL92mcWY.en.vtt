throughout<00:00:58.250> the<00:00:58.490> video<00:01:00.640> here<00:01:01.640> I'm<00:01:01.760> pulling<00:01:02.120> up

00:01:02.230 --> 00:01:02.240 
throughout the video here I'm pulling up

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:04.810 
throughout the video here I'm pulling up
in<00:01:02.510> doing<00:01:02.960> a<00:01:03.050> series<00:01:03.470> of<00:01:03.800> loops<00:01:04.100> now<00:01:04.520> that<00:01:04.790> I

00:01:04.810 --> 00:01:04.820 
in doing a series of loops now that I

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:07.870 
in doing a series of loops now that I
have<00:01:05.120> all<00:01:05.360> this<00:01:05.510> excess<00:01:05.990> power<00:01:06.290> I'm<00:01:07.280> able<00:01:07.700> to

00:01:07.870 --> 00:01:07.880 
have all this excess power I'm able to

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:10.930 
have all this excess power I'm able to
stretch<00:01:08.240> the<00:01:08.600> vertical<00:01:09.020> and<00:01:09.460> the<00:01:10.460> top<00:01:10.670> of<00:01:10.880> the

00:01:10.930 --> 00:01:10.940 
stretch the vertical and the top of the

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:13.510 
stretch the vertical and the top of the
loop<00:01:11.120> and<00:01:11.420> make<00:01:12.080> a<00:01:12.110> nice<00:01:12.410> round<00:01:12.710> loop<00:01:12.830> and<00:01:13.250> play

00:01:13.510 --> 00:01:13.520 
loop and make a nice round loop and play

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:15.610 
loop and make a nice round loop and play
somewhere<00:01:13.910> I<00:01:13.940> want<00:01:14.330> just<00:01:15.020> like<00:01:15.200> a<00:01:15.230> pattern

00:01:15.610 --> 00:01:15.620 
somewhere I want just like a pattern

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:19.600 
somewhere I want just like a pattern
aircraft<00:01:16.040> it<00:01:16.850> actually<00:01:17.270> tracks<00:01:17.570> very<00:01:17.780> well<00:01:18.610> on

00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:19.610 
aircraft it actually tracks very well on

00:01:19.610 --> 00:01:21.600 
aircraft it actually tracks very well on
this<00:01:19.850> flight<00:01:20.150> I<00:01:20.180> didn't<00:01:20.600> have<00:01:20.780> money

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:21.610 
this flight I didn't have money

00:01:21.610 --> 00:01:24.940 
this flight I didn't have money
removable<00:01:22.610> rudder<00:01:23.060> so<00:01:23.780> it's<00:01:24.260> really<00:01:24.830> just

00:01:24.940 --> 00:01:24.950 
removable rudder so it's really just

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:28.590 
removable rudder so it's really just
tracking<00:01:25.400> based<00:01:25.820> on<00:01:26.150> how<00:01:26.540> it's<00:01:26.720> set<00:01:26.960> up<00:01:27.010> and

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:28.600 
tracking based on how it's set up and

00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:31.990 
tracking based on how it's set up and
again<00:01:29.600> it's<00:01:29.900> a<00:01:30.020> zero<00:01:30.290> right<00:01:30.680> degree<00:01:31.430> thrust

00:01:31.990 --> 00:01:32.000 
again it's a zero right degree thrust

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:35.080 
again it's a zero right degree thrust
line<00:01:32.290> here<00:01:33.290> you'll<00:01:33.440> see<00:01:33.619> a<00:01:33.650> series<00:01:34.100> of<00:01:34.160> rolls<00:01:34.520> I

00:01:35.080 --> 00:01:35.090 
line here you'll see a series of rolls I

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:39.600 
line here you'll see a series of rolls I
have<00:01:35.690> no<00:01:35.990> problem<00:01:36.560> now

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:39.610 

00:01:39.610 --> 00:01:42.399

00:01:42.399 --> 00:01:42.409 
because I know won't get a stock here is

00:01:42.409 --> 00:01:44.020 
because I know won't get a stock here is

it<00:01:52.000> still<00:01:52.329> has<00:01:52.600> the<00:01:52.960> great<00:01:53.259> slow<00:01:53.619> flight

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:53.890 
it still has the great slow flight

00:01:53.890 --> 00:01:56.760 
it still has the great slow flight
characteristics<00:01:54.340> this<00:01:55.030> is<00:01:55.179> the<00:01:55.359> 62<00:01:55.929> inch<00:01:56.140> fly

00:02:30.509 --> 00:02:30.519 
rolls from the onboard camera here I'm

00:02:30.519 --> 00:02:33.059 
rolls from the onboard camera here I'm
doing<00:02:30.760> some<00:02:30.940> slow<00:02:31.239> fly<00:02:31.569> believe<00:02:32.500> coming<00:02:32.950> in

00:02:33.059 --> 00:02:33.069 
doing some slow fly believe coming in

doing some slow fly believe coming in
for<00:02:33.250> landing<00:02:33.489> in<00:02:34.030> front<00:02:34.630> of<00:02:34.690> myself<00:02:35.640> don't<00:02:36.640> you

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:36.730 
for landing in front of myself don't you

00:02:36.730 --> 00:02:38.970 
for landing in front of myself don't you
see<00:02:37.000> the<00:02:37.180> it<00:02:37.540> doesn't<00:02:37.900> land<00:02:38.110> that<00:02:38.349> fast<00:02:38.680> but

00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:38.980 
see the it doesn't land that fast but

00:02:38.980 --> 00:02:42.750 
see the it doesn't land that fast but
this<00:02:39.730> is<00:02:39.910> the<00:02:40.030> wide<00:02:40.269> open<00:02:41.340> vertical<00:02:42.340> takeoff

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:42.760 
this is the wide open vertical takeoff

00:02:42.760 --> 00:02:44.970 
this is the wide open vertical takeoff
and<00:02:43.030> as<00:02:43.209> you<00:02:43.390> can<00:02:43.569> see<00:02:43.750> it<00:02:43.930> I'm<00:02:44.290> going<00:02:44.650> to<00:02:44.739> speak

00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:44.980 
and as you can see it I'm going to speak

00:02:44.980 --> 00:02:47.490 
and as you can see it I'm going to speak
some<00:02:45.160> of<00:02:45.280> the<00:02:45.370> stars<00:02:45.640> and<00:02:46.360> as<00:02:46.690> my<00:02:46.870> dad<00:02:47.110> said

00:02:47.490 --> 00:02:47.500 
some of the stars and as my dad said

00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:49.050 
some of the stars and as my dad said
he's<00:02:47.739> sort<00:02:48.250> of<00:02:48.340> convinced<00:02:48.700> that<00:02:48.790> it<00:02:48.910> has

00:02:49.050 --> 00:02:49.060 
he's sort of convinced that it has

00:02:49.060 --> 00:02:51.539 
he's sort of convinced that it has
enough<00:02:49.239> power<00:02:49.620> and<00:02:50.620> you<00:02:50.769> can<00:02:50.890> see<00:02:51.040> how<00:02:51.190> to<00:02:51.250> just

00:02:51.539 --> 00:02:51.549 
enough power and you can see how to just

00:02:51.549 --> 00:02:53.759 
enough power and you can see how to just
accelerates<00:02:52.150> away<00:02:52.750> from<00:02:53.019> me<00:02:53.140> I<00:02:53.170> was<00:02:53.440> really

00:02:53.759 --> 00:02:53.769 
accelerates away from me I was really

00:02:53.769 --> 00:02:56.070 
accelerates away from me I was really
lucky<00:02:53.980> this<00:02:54.280> is<00:02:54.400> the<00:02:54.610> third<00:02:54.819> go<00:02:55.060> to

00:02:56.070 --> 00:02:56.080 
lucky this is the third go to

00:02:56.080 --> 00:02:58.290 
lucky this is the third go to
to<00:02:56.500> keep<00:02:56.680> myself<00:02:56.830> in<00:02:57.340> the<00:02:57.880> center<00:02:58.120> of<00:02:58.240> the

to keep myself in the center of the

00:02:58.300 --> 00:03:02.490 
to keep myself in the center of the

00:03:02.490 --> 00:03:02.500 
frame I'm pulling up into a loop I

00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:06.270 
frame I'm pulling up into a loop I
believe<00:03:02.890> I<00:03:03.160> have<00:03:03.370> the<00:03:03.400> airborne<00:03:03.970> camera<00:03:05.280> shot

00:03:06.270 --> 00:03:06.280 
believe I have the airborne camera shot

00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:10.320 
believe I have the airborne camera shot
of<00:03:06.580> this<00:03:07.240> very<00:03:07.540> same<00:03:07.810> loop<00:03:08.850> it's<00:03:09.850> tend<00:03:10.090> to<00:03:10.180> be

00:03:10.320 --> 00:03:10.330 
of this very same loop it's tend to be

00:03:10.330 --> 00:03:12.390 
of this very same loop it's tend to be
what<00:03:10.750> I<00:03:10.840> totally<00:03:11.080> doll<00:03:11.470> on<00:03:11.890> the<00:03:11.920> airborne

00:03:12.390 --> 00:03:12.400 
what I totally doll on the airborne

00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:16.740 
what I totally doll on the airborne
camera<00:03:13.500> but<00:03:14.500> here<00:03:14.710> you<00:03:14.830> can<00:03:15.010> see<00:03:15.040> it<00:03:15.600> you<00:03:16.600> see

00:03:16.740 --> 00:03:16.750 
camera but here you can see it you see

00:03:16.750 --> 00:03:20.040 
camera but here you can see it you see
the<00:03:16.870> Sun<00:03:17.110> going<00:03:17.290> by<00:03:18.360> come<00:03:19.360> back<00:03:19.540> down<00:03:19.780> on<00:03:19.960> the

the Sun going by come back down on the
rise<00:03:20.260> and<00:03:20.500> returns<00:03:20.890> and<00:03:21.190> I<00:03:21.280> turn<00:03:21.520> out<00:03:24.840> here<00:03:25.840> I

00:03:25.860 --> 00:03:25.870 
rise and returns and I turn out here I

00:03:25.870 --> 00:03:27.860 
rise and returns and I turn out here I
believe<00:03:26.230> I'm<00:03:26.440> setting<00:03:26.830> up<00:03:26.920> for<00:03:26.980> a<00:03:27.250> vertical

00:03:27.860 --> 00:03:27.870 
believe I'm setting up for a vertical

00:03:27.870 --> 00:03:32.010 
believe I'm setting up for a vertical
set<00:03:28.870> of<00:03:28.990> roles<00:03:29.200> and<00:03:30.450> it<00:03:31.450> doesn't<00:03:31.810> roll

00:03:32.010 --> 00:03:32.020 
set of roles and it doesn't roll

00:03:32.020 --> 00:03:34.050 
set of roles and it doesn't roll
fantastically<00:03:33.010> and<00:03:33.190> it's<00:03:33.310> wobbles<00:03:33.940> a<00:03:34.030> little

00:03:34.050 --> 00:03:34.060 
fantastically and it's wobbles a little

00:03:34.060 --> 00:03:37.620 
fantastically and it's wobbles a little
bit<00:03:34.360> on<00:03:34.480> axis<00:03:34.930> but<00:03:35.140> it<00:03:35.260> is<00:03:36.030> fun<00:03:37.030> to<00:03:37.209> do<00:03:37.330> those

00:03:37.620 --> 00:03:37.630 
bit on axis but it is fun to do those

00:03:37.630 --> 00:03:39.420 
bit on axis but it is fun to do those
vertical<00:03:38.230> rolls<00:03:38.470> and<00:03:38.740> show<00:03:38.890> off<00:03:39.040> the<00:03:39.250> power

00:03:39.420 --> 00:03:39.430 
vertical rolls and show off the power

00:03:39.430 --> 00:03:43.170 
vertical rolls and show off the power
and<00:03:39.910> here<00:03:40.840> I<00:03:40.870> do<00:03:41.020> a<00:03:41.430> recovery<00:03:42.430> with<00:03:42.850> a<00:03:42.880> dive

00:03:43.170 --> 00:03:43.180 
and here I do a recovery with a dive

00:03:43.180 --> 00:03:48.270 
and here I do a recovery with a dive
down<00:03:44.050> for<00:03:44.380> a<00:03:44.410> low<00:03:44.620> pass<00:03:44.890> but<00:03:46.680> again<00:03:47.680> I<00:03:47.860> have<00:03:48.100> no

00:03:48.270 --> 00:03:48.280 
down for a low pass but again I have no

00:03:48.280 --> 00:03:49.949 
down for a low pass but again I have no
hesitation<00:03:48.459> about<00:03:49.030> one<00:03:49.450> there's<00:03:49.690> a<00:03:49.780> low

00:03:49.949 --> 00:03:49.959 
hesitation about one there's a low

00:03:49.959 --> 00:03:51.870 
hesitation about one there's a low
altitude<00:03:50.170> that<00:03:50.680> it<00:03:50.800> does<00:03:50.980> fly<00:03:51.220> so<00:03:51.430> much<00:03:51.580> like<00:03:51.730> a

00:03:51.870 --> 00:03:51.880 
altitude that it does fly so much like a

00:03:51.880 --> 00:03:53.110 
altitude that it does fly so much like a
crane

00:03:53.110 --> 00:03:53.120 
crane

00:03:53.120 --> 00:03:55.869 
crane
with<00:03:53.870> power<00:03:54.080> off<00:03:54.349> with<00:03:54.680> cow<00:03:54.860> on<00:03:55.069> now<00:03:55.310> it's<00:03:55.550> more

00:03:55.869 --> 00:03:55.879 
with power off with cow on now it's more

00:03:55.879 --> 00:03:58.839 
with power off with cow on now it's more
like<00:03:55.910> a<00:03:56.090> pattern<00:03:56.360> point<00:03:57.250> here's<00:03:58.250> the<00:03:58.459> exact

00:03:58.839 --> 00:03:58.849 
like a pattern point here's the exact

00:03:58.849 --> 00:04:01.300 
like a pattern point here's the exact
same<00:03:59.150> sequence

00:04:01.300 --> 00:04:01.310 
same sequence

00:04:01.310 --> 00:04:03.130 
same sequence
pulling<00:04:01.850> up<00:04:02.030> and<00:04:02.209> you<00:04:02.300> can<00:04:02.420> see<00:04:02.569> me<00:04:02.720> go<00:04:02.870> through

00:04:03.130 --> 00:04:03.140 
pulling up and you can see me go through

00:04:03.140 --> 00:04:04.320 
pulling up and you can see me go through
the<00:04:03.260> frame

00:04:04.320 --> 00:04:04.330 
the frame

00:04:04.330 --> 00:04:07.500 
the frame
they're<00:04:04.540> on<00:04:04.690> the<00:04:04.780> ground<00:04:06.240> here's<00:04:07.240> another

00:04:07.500 --> 00:04:07.510 
they're on the ground here's another

00:04:07.510 --> 00:04:09.330 
they're on the ground here's another
sequence<00:04:07.990> where<00:04:08.230> I<00:04:08.260> went<00:04:08.560> up<00:04:08.680> and<00:04:08.890> did<00:04:08.980> a<00:04:09.040> set

00:04:09.330 --> 00:04:09.340 
sequence where I went up and did a set

00:04:09.340 --> 00:04:12.240 
sequence where I went up and did a set
of<00:04:09.460> vertical<00:04:09.670> rolls<00:04:10.060> and<00:04:10.390> I<00:04:10.600> recover<00:04:11.020> and<00:04:11.290> then

00:04:12.240 --> 00:04:12.250 
of vertical rolls and I recover and then

00:04:12.250 --> 00:04:16.729 
of vertical rolls and I recover and then
did<00:04:12.490> some<00:04:12.520> intervertebral

00:04:16.729 --> 00:04:16.739 

00:04:16.739 --> 00:04:19.440 

again<00:04:17.739> it's<00:04:17.920> fairly<00:04:18.100> unstable<00:04:18.549> inverted<00:04:19.269> but

00:04:19.440 --> 00:04:19.450 
again it's fairly unstable inverted but

00:04:19.450 --> 00:04:21.300 
again it's fairly unstable inverted but
you<00:04:19.570> could<00:04:19.750> do<00:04:19.900> a<00:04:20.200> nice<00:04:20.470> straight<00:04:20.890> long

00:04:21.300 --> 00:04:21.310 
you could do a nice straight long

00:04:21.310 --> 00:04:27.510 
you could do a nice straight long
inverted<00:04:22.060> passes<00:04:22.540> with<00:04:23.230> that<00:04:23.380> problem<00:04:26.520> and

00:04:27.510 --> 00:04:27.520 
inverted passes with that problem and

00:04:27.520 --> 00:04:29.970 
inverted passes with that problem and
this<00:04:27.940> is<00:04:28.000> my<00:04:28.390> slow<00:04:28.660> fly<00:04:28.960> setting<00:04:29.410> up<00:04:29.530> for<00:04:29.800> my

00:04:29.970 --> 00:04:29.980 
this is my slow fly setting up for my

00:04:29.980 --> 00:04:33.540 
this is my slow fly setting up for my
landing<00:04:30.400> in<00:04:30.520> front<00:04:30.550> of<00:04:30.850> the<00:04:30.910> camera<00:04:31.350> and<00:04:32.550> I

00:04:33.540 --> 00:04:33.550 
landing in front of the camera and I

00:04:33.550 --> 00:04:36.810 
landing in front of the camera and I
thank<00:04:33.850> you<00:04:33.970> for<00:04:34.120> watching<00:04:35.310> why<00:04:36.310> guy<00:04:36.520> has
