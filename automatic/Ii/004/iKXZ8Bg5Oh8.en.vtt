00:00:02.810 --> 00:00:09.860
 however the disadvantage that you have to 

00:00:05.460 --> 00:00:13.170
 take good care but your good to do 

00:00:09.860 --> 00:00:15.630
 application of the product belongs to the 

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:17.970
 a Boeing machine was very notify 

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:19.830
 steps that take great care of your beret and 

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:23.100
 hardly care about the 

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:25.109
 part is only concerned with the foot is 

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:26.880
 you removed the refined defect one 

00:00:25.109 --> 00:00:30.119
 correct way but you do not have much 

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:32.520
 error if you see the machine one time 

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:36.989
 very large so an area you do not have 

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:38.940
 too much trouble and it's an easy machine 

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:40.530
 finish can you help 

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:41.700
 design my company final steps 

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:43.739
 understanding you get a result 

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:45.239
 very cool with a drawing machine ? 

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:54.329
 it's harder the chance to go to the top 

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:56.579
 the rotary polishing machine can be expected 

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:58.949
 since you are respect some 

00:00:56.579 --> 00:01:01.020
 practice a little 

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:04.559
 especially in the position in this position 

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:08.100
 Here paw the doors of the side you 

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:11.490
 will have a faster result it will 

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:13.979
 have a much higher shear power in 

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:16.049
 much greater defect removal power 

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:23.159
 of a sad thing vital fact 

00:01:16.049 --> 00:01:24.570
 It's because you will not have problems with 

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:26.460
 the diseases you will be using 

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:29.369
 here you will hardly have the effect 

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:34.010
 the beret a problem with the good and I hope 

00:01:29.369 --> 00:01:36.280
 that here will not have dollar problem 

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:39.290
 the fact of the greatest abrasion spoken here a 

00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:40.670
 contact with the can you will have the 

00:01:39.290 --> 00:01:43.850
 warming up 

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:46.520
 beauty is and will eventually burn 

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:48.110
 cans innocent to burn paint if you 

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:50.000
 have not practiced before had not 

00:01:48.110 --> 00:01:52.910
 a lot of experience is the same 

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:55.850
 and it is a machine that is more difficult 

00:01:52.910 --> 00:01:57.440
 from you from the sea or walk many gallops 

00:01:55.850 --> 00:02:00.470
 eventually the product that you are 

00:01:57.440 --> 00:02:02.300
 using and the beret is she stays a 

00:02:00.470 --> 00:02:05.120
 contact much larger than the surface it 

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:07.400
 gives much more galloping're if you do not 

00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:10.510
 tilt her on the surface you dig 

00:02:07.400 --> 00:02:13.010
 mark smile and stare with her 

00:02:10.510 --> 00:02:15.170
 slope causes very strong marks 

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:18.260
 because of the contact for you will have 

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:20.300
 very strong contact with the can and the route 

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:22.550
 vital soften a bit because she 

00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:24.290
 A little more trip you have a little 

00:02:22.550 --> 00:02:27.170
 over left field with a machine 

00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:30.050
 10 overcoming the wrong way puts itself 

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:32.120
 in the easy one that gives unlike the 

00:02:30.050 --> 00:02:33.890
 orbital you will hardly start 

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:35.600
 here 's unless you 're working 

00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:39.560
 in a cutting step in a very 

00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:42.170
 cool and I particularly prefer 

00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:43.790
 rotating for I started as an attempt 

00:02:42.170 --> 00:02:46.640
 I like her because she is faster. 

00:02:43.790 --> 00:02:50.120
 for you to operate since you get her 

00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:52.340
 a correct way are you going to have the 

00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:53.840
 same result as with the route 

00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:54.650
 hospital but a much more 

00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:56.780
 fast 

00:02:54.650 --> 00:02:58.730
 only that it has activities that I can not 

00:02:56.780 --> 00:03:01.010
 ensure that this is right for you. 

00:02:58.730 --> 00:03:02.520
 I can not 

00:03:01.010 --> 00:03:07.110
 use this mark 

00:03:02.520 --> 00:03:08.940
 beauty the people I think that's it 

00:03:07.110 --> 00:03:11.550
 I hope you liked the video 

00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:13.830
 there has given a great deal of excitement to 

00:03:11.550 --> 00:03:16.670
 about the differences of machines 

00:03:13.830 --> 00:03:19.860
 there it's right 

00:03:16.670 --> 00:03:21.990
 if you like and subscribe to our channel and 

00:03:19.860 --> 00:03:24.290
 waiting for news there a hug until 

00:03:21.990 --> 00:03:24.290
 more
