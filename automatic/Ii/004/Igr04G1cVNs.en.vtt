fed<00:00:05.130> pole<00:00:05.210> this<00:00:06.210> is<00:00:06.359> the<00:00:06.509> situation<00:00:07.049> so<00:00:07.319> far

00:00:07.610 --> 00:00:07.620 
fed pole this is the situation so far

00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:10.910 
fed pole this is the situation so far
what<00:00:07.919> we've<00:00:08.069> done<00:00:08.280> is<00:00:08.460> cut<00:00:09.420> the<00:00:09.660> control<00:00:10.559> board

00:00:10.910 --> 00:00:10.920 
what we've done is cut the control board

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:13.430 
what we've done is cut the control board
down<00:00:11.250> the<00:00:11.700> piece<00:00:11.940> of<00:00:12.120> wood<00:00:12.300> that<00:00:12.330> is<00:00:12.540> because

00:00:13.430 --> 00:00:13.440 
down the piece of wood that is because

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:15.200 
down the piece of wood that is because
we<00:00:13.559> didn't<00:00:13.740> need<00:00:13.830> is<00:00:13.980> big<00:00:14.340> we<00:00:14.670> decided<00:00:15.120> to

00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:15.210 
we didn't need is big we decided to

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:16.730 
we didn't need is big we decided to
mount<00:00:15.420> it<00:00:15.570> in<00:00:15.690> the<00:00:15.719> middle<00:00:16.049> that's<00:00:16.470> a<00:00:16.590> good

00:00:16.730 --> 00:00:16.740 
mount it in the middle that's a good

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:19.130 
mount it in the middle that's a good
thing<00:00:17.490> about<00:00:17.580> these<00:00:17.850> IBC<00:00:18.449> tanks<00:00:18.840> about<00:00:19.020> the

00:00:19.130 --> 00:00:19.140 
thing about these IBC tanks about the

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:20.779 
thing about these IBC tanks about the
only<00:00:19.260> good<00:00:19.439> thing<00:00:19.590> as<00:00:19.710> opposed<00:00:19.980> is<00:00:20.520> that<00:00:20.730> you

00:00:20.779 --> 00:00:20.789 
only good thing as opposed is that you

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:23.179 
only good thing as opposed is that you
can<00:00:20.970> mount<00:00:21.180> stuff<00:00:21.539> on<00:00:21.900> them<00:00:22.170> in<00:00:22.410> various

00:00:23.179 --> 00:00:23.189 
can mount stuff on them in various

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:26.179 
can mount stuff on them in various
places<00:00:23.750> we've<00:00:24.750> got<00:00:24.990> everything<00:00:25.650> set<00:00:25.769> up<00:00:26.070> as

00:00:26.179 --> 00:00:26.189 
places we've got everything set up as

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:30.050 
places we've got everything set up as
you<00:00:26.220> can<00:00:26.340> see<00:00:27.109> bump<00:00:28.109> flow<00:00:29.010> control<00:00:29.400> switch

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:30.060 
you can see bump flow control switch

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:32.179 
you can see bump flow control switch
it's<00:00:30.990> not<00:00:31.109> actually<00:00:31.380> wired<00:00:31.590> up<00:00:31.769> so<00:00:31.890> I<00:00:31.920> can't

00:00:32.179 --> 00:00:32.189 
it's not actually wired up so I can't

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:33.799 
it's not actually wired up so I can't
show<00:00:32.369> you<00:00:32.399> it<00:00:32.640> actually<00:00:33.180> working<00:00:33.390> yet<00:00:33.690> we're

00:00:33.799 --> 00:00:33.809 
show you it actually working yet we're

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:35.180 
show you it actually working yet we're
gonna<00:00:33.899> wait<00:00:34.140> until<00:00:34.260> we<00:00:34.469> actually<00:00:34.620> install

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:35.190 
gonna wait until we actually install

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:37.700 
gonna wait until we actually install
this<00:00:35.690> we've<00:00:36.690> just<00:00:36.809> don't<00:00:37.050> measured<00:00:37.410> it<00:00:37.559> out

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:37.710 
this we've just don't measured it out

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:39.319 
this we've just don't measured it out
and<00:00:37.890> just<00:00:38.129> to<00:00:38.280> see<00:00:38.430> how<00:00:38.489> it<00:00:38.640> would<00:00:38.820> go<00:00:39.059> and<00:00:39.239> this

00:00:39.319 --> 00:00:39.329 
and just to see how it would go and this

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:40.880 
and just to see how it would go and this
just<00:00:39.570> seems<00:00:39.750> to<00:00:39.840> fit<00:00:39.960> very<00:00:40.170> very<00:00:40.410> very<00:00:40.620> well

00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:40.890 
just seems to fit very very very well

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:43.700 
just seems to fit very very very well
I'm<00:00:41.700> quite<00:00:42.239> pleased<00:00:42.510> with<00:00:42.750> that<00:00:42.780> I've

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:43.710 
I'm quite pleased with that I've

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:46.430 
I'm quite pleased with that I've
installed<00:00:44.070> a<00:00:44.250> little<00:00:44.430> tap<00:00:44.670> here<00:00:45.289> now<00:00:46.289> what

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:46.440 
installed a little tap here now what

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:48.130 
installed a little tap here now what
you'll<00:00:46.559> find<00:00:46.710> it<00:00:46.920> wasn't<00:00:47.219> much<00:00:47.399> pressure

00:00:48.130 --> 00:00:48.140 
you'll find it wasn't much pressure

00:00:48.140 --> 00:00:50.569 
you'll find it wasn't much pressure
coming<00:00:49.140> in<00:00:49.350> from<00:00:50.010> the<00:00:50.190> tank

00:00:50.569 --> 00:00:50.579 
coming in from the tank

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:54.170 
coming in from the tank
there's<00:00:51.239> just<00:00:51.480> gravity<00:00:52.079> of<00:00:52.379> the<00:00:52.980> thing<00:00:53.219> comes

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:54.180 
there's just gravity of the thing comes

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:57.529 
there's just gravity of the thing comes
around<00:00:54.539> here<00:00:54.920> into<00:00:55.920> your<00:00:55.949> filter<00:00:56.910> to<00:00:57.390> filter

00:00:57.529 --> 00:00:57.539 
around here into your filter to filter

00:00:57.539 --> 00:01:00.319 
around here into your filter to filter
out<00:00:57.780> any<00:00:57.899> debris<00:00:58.109> and<00:00:58.469> into<00:00:59.370> the<00:00:59.460> pump<00:00:59.699> up<00:01:00.270> to

00:01:00.319 --> 00:01:00.329 
out any debris and into the pump up to

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:02.090 
out any debris and into the pump up to
this<00:01:00.539> point<00:01:00.840> you'll<00:01:01.289> find<00:01:01.590> that<00:01:01.710> it's<00:01:01.829> hardly

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:02.100 
this point you'll find that it's hardly

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:04.840 
this point you'll find that it's hardly
any<00:01:02.370> pressure<00:01:02.640> at<00:01:02.940> all<00:01:03.120> but<00:01:03.960> after<00:01:04.559> that<00:01:04.680> point

00:01:04.840 --> 00:01:04.850 
any pressure at all but after that point

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:06.950 
any pressure at all but after that point
when<00:01:05.850> the<00:01:05.970> pump<00:01:06.180> pressures<00:01:06.540> up<00:01:06.720> you're<00:01:06.869> gonna

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:06.960 
when the pump pressures up you're gonna

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:09.859 
when the pump pressures up you're gonna
get<00:01:07.140> the<00:01:07.260> full<00:01:07.500> pressure<00:01:07.799> off<00:01:08.729> your<00:01:09.090> actual

00:01:09.859 --> 00:01:09.869 
get the full pressure off your actual

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:12.920 
get the full pressure off your actual
pump<00:01:10.170> itself<00:01:10.560> which<00:01:11.299> could<00:01:12.299> be<00:01:12.450> anything

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:12.930 
pump itself which could be anything

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:17.060 
pump itself which could be anything
between<00:01:13.229> 60<00:01:13.979> and<00:01:14.010> 100<00:01:14.580> psi<00:01:15.080> so<00:01:16.080> from<00:01:16.890> here

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:17.070 
between 60 and 100 psi so from here

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:20.719 
between 60 and 100 psi so from here
onwards<00:01:17.520> you<00:01:17.780> you<00:01:18.780> can<00:01:19.020> get<00:01:19.290> leaks<00:01:19.560> so<00:01:20.490> we've

00:01:20.719 --> 00:01:20.729 
onwards you you can get leaks so we've

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:23.810 
onwards you you can get leaks so we've
put<00:01:20.939> PTFE<00:01:21.570> tape<00:01:21.869> on<00:01:22.080> that<00:01:22.110> and<00:01:22.470> a<00:01:22.590> good<00:01:23.040> strong

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:23.820 
put PTFE tape on that and a good strong

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:26.149 
put PTFE tape on that and a good strong
Jubilee<00:01:24.420> clip<00:01:24.689> of<00:01:25.470> course<00:01:25.650> you've<00:01:25.740> gotta<00:01:25.890> test

00:01:26.149 --> 00:01:26.159 
Jubilee clip of course you've gotta test

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:29.300 
Jubilee clip of course you've gotta test
this<00:01:26.220> out<00:01:26.460> yet<00:01:26.759> now<00:01:27.420> from<00:01:27.600> that<00:01:27.750> point<00:01:27.960> on<00:01:28.310> it

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:29.310 
this out yet now from that point on it

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:31.280 
this out yet now from that point on it
depends<00:01:29.700> what<00:01:29.970> size<00:01:30.240> fine<00:01:30.509> you've<00:01:30.659> got<00:01:30.689> etc

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:31.290 
depends what size fine you've got etc

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:34.130 
depends what size fine you've got etc
but<00:01:31.439> always<00:01:31.799> leave<00:01:32.280> yourself<00:01:32.490> a<00:01:32.820> good<00:01:33.049> bit<00:01:34.049> of

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:34.140 
but always leave yourself a good bit of

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:38.060 
but always leave yourself a good bit of
hose<00:01:34.380> that<00:01:36.020> can<00:01:37.020> go<00:01:37.200> out<00:01:37.439> of<00:01:37.650> the<00:01:37.710> van<00:01:37.860> so<00:01:37.979> if

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:38.070 
hose that can go out of the van so if

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:39.710 
hose that can go out of the van so if
you<00:01:38.130> want<00:01:38.250> to<00:01:38.340> take<00:01:38.520> the<00:01:38.700> hose<00:01:39.060> reel<00:01:39.299> out<00:01:39.479> of

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:39.720 
you want to take the hose reel out of

you want to take the hose reel out of
the<00:01:39.810> van<00:01:40.020> and<00:01:40.290> lift<00:01:40.860> it<00:01:40.979> out<00:01:41.070> and<00:01:41.280> put<00:01:41.400> it<00:01:41.490> on

00:01:41.569 --> 00:01:41.579 
the van and lift it out and put it on

00:01:41.579 --> 00:01:44.480 
the van and lift it out and put it on
the<00:01:41.700> deck<00:01:42.200> in<00:01:43.200> any<00:01:43.380> position<00:01:43.829> you<00:01:43.860> want<00:01:44.189> or<00:01:44.430> you

the deck in any position you want or you

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:46.520 
the deck in any position you want or you
can<00:01:44.549> just<00:01:44.759> leave<00:01:44.970> it<00:01:45.119> in<00:01:45.210> so<00:01:45.509> always<00:01:46.170> have<00:01:46.380> it

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:46.530 
can just leave it in so always have it

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:48.889 
can just leave it in so always have it
just<00:01:46.710> a<00:01:47.070> bit<00:01:47.640> longer<00:01:47.790> we've<00:01:48.240> got<00:01:48.360> plenty<00:01:48.570> there

00:01:48.889 --> 00:01:48.899 
just a bit longer we've got plenty there

00:01:48.899 --> 00:01:52.700 
just a bit longer we've got plenty there
to<00:01:49.799> wind<00:01:50.040> up<00:01:50.250> another<00:01:51.149> point<00:01:51.450> I<00:01:51.930> mentioned

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:52.710 
to wind up another point I mentioned

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:55.429 
to wind up another point I mentioned
before<00:01:53.240> you<00:01:54.240> really<00:01:54.509> need<00:01:54.659> to<00:01:54.780> get<00:01:54.869> this<00:01:54.990> elbow

00:01:55.429 --> 00:01:55.439 
before you really need to get this elbow

00:01:55.439 --> 00:01:57.109 
before you really need to get this elbow
here<00:01:55.950> for<00:01:56.250> your<00:01:56.340> hose<00:01:56.490> reel<00:01:56.729> if<00:01:56.850> it's<00:01:57.000> not

00:01:57.109 --> 00:01:57.119 
here for your hose reel if it's not

00:01:57.119 --> 00:01:59.569 
here for your hose reel if it's not
delivered<00:01:57.360> with<00:01:57.600> it<00:01:57.780> you<00:01:58.740> can<00:01:58.890> see<00:01:59.100> that<00:01:59.369> I'll

00:01:59.569 --> 00:01:59.579 
delivered with it you can see that I'll

00:01:59.579 --> 00:02:01.700 
delivered with it you can see that I'll
just<00:01:59.850> turn<00:02:00.149> the<00:02:00.329> hose<00:02:00.479> reel<00:02:00.750> you<00:02:01.350> can<00:02:01.469> see<00:02:01.649> it

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:01.710 
just turn the hose reel you can see it

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:05.950 
just turn the hose reel you can see it
turning<00:02:02.130> now<00:02:03.200> see<00:02:04.200> if<00:02:04.380> you<00:02:04.439> don't<00:02:04.710> get<00:02:04.920> that

00:02:05.950 --> 00:02:05.960 
turning now see if you don't get that

00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:08.419 
turning now see if you don't get that
it's<00:02:06.960> just<00:02:07.170> gonna<00:02:07.350> tangle<00:02:07.680> the<00:02:07.860> hose<00:02:08.039> up<00:02:08.280> and

00:02:08.419 --> 00:02:08.429 
it's just gonna tangle the hose up and

00:02:08.429 --> 00:02:09.430 
it's just gonna tangle the hose up and
you<00:02:08.489> can't<00:02:08.729> use<00:02:08.940> it

00:02:09.430 --> 00:02:09.440 
you can't use it

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:12.620 
you can't use it
and<00:02:10.440> that's<00:02:10.590> a<00:02:10.680> principle<00:02:10.890> of<00:02:11.220> that<00:02:11.540> at<00:02:12.540> the

00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:12.630 
and that's a principle of that at the

00:02:12.630 --> 00:02:14.390 
and that's a principle of that at the
other<00:02:12.750> end<00:02:12.990> here<00:02:13.260> something<00:02:13.950> I<00:02:14.010> forgot<00:02:14.250> to

00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:14.400 
other end here something I forgot to

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:17.720 
other end here something I forgot to
mention<00:02:14.900> it<00:02:15.900> usually<00:02:16.320> comes<00:02:16.500> with<00:02:16.740> it<00:02:16.950> Sharada

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:17.730 
mention it usually comes with it Sharada

00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:21.980 
mention it usually comes with it Sharada
connector<00:02:20.060> now<00:02:21.060> to<00:02:21.120> be<00:02:21.450> able<00:02:21.510> to<00:02:21.660> use<00:02:21.810> like

00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:21.990 
connector now to be able to use like

00:02:21.990 --> 00:02:23.450 
connector now to be able to use like
John<00:02:22.290> guests<00:02:22.560> and<00:02:22.830> that<00:02:22.920> just<00:02:23.130> put<00:02:23.250> a<00:02:23.280> finish

00:02:23.450 --> 00:02:23.460 
John guests and that just put a finish

00:02:23.460 --> 00:02:26.680 
John guests and that just put a finish
piece<00:02:23.820> of<00:02:23.940> tube<00:02:24.320> onto<00:02:25.320> your<00:02:25.470> mail<00:02:26.070> shorter

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:26.690 
piece of tube onto your mail shorter

00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:30.530 
piece of tube onto your mail shorter
side<00:02:27.690> like<00:02:27.990> that<00:02:28.940> and<00:02:29.940> that<00:02:30.060> goes<00:02:30.240> to<00:02:30.330> your

00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:30.540 
side like that and that goes to your

00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:33.620 
side like that and that goes to your
pole<00:02:31.250> end<00:02:32.250> and<00:02:32.670> that<00:02:32.820> can<00:02:32.970> have<00:02:33.120> a<00:02:33.150> John<00:02:33.360> guest

00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:33.630 
pole end and that can have a John guest

00:02:33.630 --> 00:02:37.850 
pole end and that can have a John guest
on<00:02:33.890> now<00:02:34.890> every<00:02:35.070> time<00:02:35.280> you<00:02:35.630> release<00:02:36.630> this<00:02:36.900> side

00:02:37.850 --> 00:02:37.860 
on now every time you release this side

00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:40.490 
on now every time you release this side
from<00:02:38.250> a<00:02:38.310> Schroder<00:02:38.610> connector<00:02:39.150> it<00:02:40.020> cuts<00:02:40.290> off

00:02:40.490 --> 00:02:40.500 
from a Schroder connector it cuts off

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:43.340 
from a Schroder connector it cuts off
the<00:02:40.530> flow<00:02:40.680> so<00:02:41.520> you<00:02:41.550> won't<00:02:41.790> get<00:02:41.910> water<00:02:42.840> pouring

00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:43.350 
the flow so you won't get water pouring

00:02:43.350 --> 00:02:45.650 
the flow so you won't get water pouring
all<00:02:43.500> over<00:02:43.530> your<00:02:43.920> van<00:02:44.130> so<00:02:45.030> that's<00:02:45.210> useful<00:02:45.420> for

00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:45.660 
all over your van so that's useful for

00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:51.680 
all over your van so that's useful for
that<00:02:45.930> anyway<00:02:47.000> so<00:02:48.000> for<00:02:48.450> now<00:02:50.360> what<00:02:51.360> else<00:02:51.540> is

00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:51.690 
that anyway so for now what else is

00:02:51.690 --> 00:02:54.230 
that anyway so for now what else is
there<00:02:51.900> before<00:02:52.590> I<00:02:52.650> forget<00:02:52.770> yet<00:02:53.160> I'll<00:02:53.910> put<00:02:54.209> a

00:02:54.230 --> 00:02:54.240 
there before I forget yet I'll put a

00:02:54.240 --> 00:02:55.670 
there before I forget yet I'll put a
little<00:02:54.450> tap<00:02:54.690> on<00:02:54.840> here<00:02:55.020> rather<00:02:55.230> than<00:02:55.350> use<00:02:55.530> the

00:02:55.670 --> 00:02:55.680 
little tap on here rather than use the

00:02:55.680 --> 00:02:58.190 
little tap on here rather than use the
large<00:02:55.920> blue<00:02:56.250> one<00:02:56.459> all<00:02:56.580> the<00:02:56.730> time<00:02:56.930> we<00:02:57.930> put<00:02:58.170> a

00:02:58.190 --> 00:02:58.200 
large blue one all the time we put a

00:02:58.200 --> 00:03:01.100 
large blue one all the time we put a
small<00:02:58.440> tap<00:02:58.920> here<00:02:59.390> so<00:03:00.390> that<00:03:00.540> we<00:03:00.600> can<00:03:00.720> turn<00:03:00.900> that

00:03:01.100 --> 00:03:01.110 
small tap here so that we can turn that

00:03:01.110 --> 00:03:03.440 
small tap here so that we can turn that
off<00:03:01.170> on<00:03:01.709> and<00:03:01.860> off<00:03:01.950> so<00:03:02.670> if<00:03:02.760> the<00:03:02.850> big<00:03:03.030> one<00:03:03.180> wears

00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:03.450 
off on and off so if the big one wears

00:03:03.450 --> 00:03:06.110 
off on and off so if the big one wears
out<00:03:03.720> then<00:03:04.080> you're<00:03:04.950> stuffed<00:03:05.310> whereas<00:03:06.000> the

00:03:06.110 --> 00:03:06.120 
out then you're stuffed whereas the

00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:08.720 
out then you're stuffed whereas the
small<00:03:06.420> one<00:03:06.600> can<00:03:06.630> be<00:03:06.840> easily<00:03:07.170> replaced<00:03:07.730> now

00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:08.730 
small one can be easily replaced now

00:03:08.730 --> 00:03:10.220 
small one can be easily replaced now
what<00:03:08.940> we're<00:03:09.060> hoping<00:03:09.150> is<00:03:09.420> we<00:03:09.570> don't<00:03:09.930> get<00:03:10.050> too

00:03:10.220 --> 00:03:10.230 
what we're hoping is we don't get too

00:03:10.230 --> 00:03:12.110 
what we're hoping is we don't get too
many<00:03:10.320> leaks<00:03:10.620> in<00:03:10.860> these<00:03:11.070> I<00:03:11.400> don't<00:03:11.730> really<00:03:11.880> like

00:03:12.110 --> 00:03:12.120 
many leaks in these I don't really like

00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:14.479 
many leaks in these I don't really like
these<00:03:12.360> but<00:03:12.600> for<00:03:12.750> now<00:03:13.220> that's<00:03:14.220> what<00:03:14.400> we're

00:03:14.479 --> 00:03:14.489 
these but for now that's what we're

00:03:14.489 --> 00:03:17.750 
these but for now that's what we're
gonna<00:03:14.580> put<00:03:14.880> on<00:03:16.070> what<00:03:17.070> else<00:03:17.220> put<00:03:17.430> a<00:03:17.459> switch

00:03:17.750 --> 00:03:17.760 
gonna put on what else put a switch

00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:21.620 
gonna put on what else put a switch
there<00:03:18.920> if<00:03:19.920> you<00:03:20.100> find<00:03:20.430> that<00:03:20.580> the<00:03:20.910> board

00:03:21.620 --> 00:03:21.630 
there if you find that the board

00:03:21.630 --> 00:03:24.350 
there if you find that the board
thickness<00:03:21.959> here<00:03:22.380> that<00:03:22.620> you<00:03:22.769> use<00:03:23.070> is<00:03:23.400> too<00:03:23.910> thick

00:03:24.350 --> 00:03:24.360 
thickness here that you use is too thick

00:03:24.360 --> 00:03:27.170 
thickness here that you use is too thick
for<00:03:24.390> your<00:03:24.660> switch<00:03:25.019> to<00:03:25.230> go<00:03:25.350> right<00:03:25.650> through<00:03:26.180> now

00:03:27.170 --> 00:03:27.180 
for your switch to go right through now

00:03:27.180 --> 00:03:31.220 
for your switch to go right through now
this<00:03:27.450> part<00:03:28.080> here<00:03:28.560> all<00:03:29.220> that<00:03:29.550> is<00:03:29.900> it's<00:03:30.900> the<00:03:30.989> very

00:03:31.220 --> 00:03:31.230 
this part here all that is it's the very

00:03:31.230 --> 00:03:33.850 
this part here all that is it's the very
end<00:03:31.620> piece<00:03:32.130> of<00:03:32.459> an<00:03:32.640> old<00:03:32.820> pump

00:03:33.850 --> 00:03:33.860 
end piece of an old pump

00:03:33.860 --> 00:03:37.100 
end piece of an old pump
it's<00:03:34.860> an<00:03:34.950> old<00:03:35.100> plastic<00:03:35.310> mould<00:03:35.820> pump<00:03:36.090> so<00:03:36.930> if<00:03:36.989> you

00:03:37.100 --> 00:03:37.110 
it's an old plastic mould pump so if you

00:03:37.110 --> 00:03:38.780 
it's an old plastic mould pump so if you
screwed<00:03:37.410> that<00:03:37.440> on<00:03:37.830> and<00:03:38.130> that<00:03:38.250> just<00:03:38.459> gives<00:03:38.670> the

00:03:38.780 --> 00:03:38.790 
screwed that on and that just gives the

00:03:38.790 --> 00:03:40.820 
screwed that on and that just gives the
clearance<00:03:39.300> there<00:03:39.570> to<00:03:40.350> be<00:03:40.410> able<00:03:40.500> to<00:03:40.620> put<00:03:40.739> the

00:03:40.820 --> 00:03:40.830 
clearance there to be able to put the

00:03:40.830 --> 00:03:42.640 
clearance there to be able to put the
switch<00:03:41.070> in<00:03:41.100> so<00:03:41.430> the<00:03:41.550> switches<00:03:41.880> inside<00:03:42.269> there

00:03:42.640 --> 00:03:42.650 
switch in so the switches inside there

00:03:42.650 --> 00:03:46.040 
switch in so the switches inside there
there's<00:03:43.650> a<00:03:43.769> hole<00:03:43.950> drilled<00:03:44.130> through<00:03:44.930> for<00:03:45.930> your

00:03:46.040 --> 00:03:46.050 
there's a hole drilled through for your

00:03:46.050 --> 00:03:48.410 
there's a hole drilled through for your
wires<00:03:46.260> to<00:03:46.470> be<00:03:46.500> connected<00:03:46.620> at<00:03:47.130> the<00:03:47.190> bracket<00:03:47.640> now

00:03:48.410 --> 00:03:48.420 
wires to be connected at the bracket now

00:03:48.420 --> 00:03:50.449 
wires to be connected at the bracket now
all<00:03:48.570> the<00:03:48.690> way<00:03:48.810> ends<00:03:49.050> around<00:03:49.170> here<00:03:49.590> and<00:03:50.250> it<00:03:50.370> will

00:03:50.449 --> 00:03:50.459 
all the way ends around here and it will
