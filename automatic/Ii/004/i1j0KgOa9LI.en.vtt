monthly<00:00:02.429> and<00:00:02.610> epiphone<00:00:03.000> guitars<00:00:03.389> today<00:00:04.230> we're

00:00:04.460 --> 00:00:04.470 
monthly and epiphone guitars today we're

00:00:04.470 --> 00:00:06.289 
monthly and epiphone guitars today we're
going<00:00:04.500> to<00:00:04.620> talk<00:00:04.859> about<00:00:05.100> the<00:00:05.460> mixolydian<00:00:06.089> mode

00:00:06.289 --> 00:00:06.299 
going to talk about the mixolydian mode

00:00:06.299 --> 00:00:09.320 
going to talk about the mixolydian mode
the<00:00:07.049> mixolydian<00:00:07.560> mode<00:00:07.770> has<00:00:08.550> a<00:00:08.580> big<00:00:08.940> name<00:00:09.120> but

00:00:09.320 --> 00:00:09.330 
the mixolydian mode has a big name but

00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:11.150 
the mixolydian mode has a big name but
it's<00:00:09.480> really<00:00:09.750> just<00:00:09.929> the<00:00:10.380> major<00:00:10.710> scale

00:00:11.150 --> 00:00:11.160 
it's really just the major scale

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:13.520 
it's really just the major scale
starting<00:00:11.190> from<00:00:11.910> a<00:00:11.969> different<00:00:12.300> place<00:00:12.509> or<00:00:12.870> you

00:00:13.520 --> 00:00:13.530 
starting from a different place or you

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:15.799 
starting from a different place or you
can<00:00:13.679> also<00:00:13.830> look<00:00:14.099> at<00:00:14.250> it<00:00:14.280> like<00:00:14.549> a<00:00:14.790> major<00:00:15.420> scale

00:00:15.799 --> 00:00:15.809 
can also look at it like a major scale

00:00:15.809 --> 00:00:18.920 
can also look at it like a major scale
with<00:00:16.199> OneNote<00:00:16.920> changed<00:00:17.609> let's<00:00:18.510> take<00:00:18.690> a<00:00:18.720> look

00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:18.930 
with OneNote changed let's take a look

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:25.099 
with OneNote changed let's take a look
at<00:00:19.020> e<00:00:19.350> here's<00:00:20.160> the<00:00:20.340> E<00:00:20.369> major<00:00:20.789> scale<00:00:23.990> here's<00:00:24.990> the

00:00:25.099 --> 00:00:25.109 
at e here's the E major scale here's the

00:00:25.109 --> 00:00:29.960 
at e here's the E major scale here's the
e<00:00:25.230> mixolydian<00:00:25.949> mode<00:00:28.429> did<00:00:29.429> you<00:00:29.550> notice<00:00:29.789> which

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:29.970 
e mixolydian mode did you notice which

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:31.880 
e mixolydian mode did you notice which
note<00:00:30.179> is<00:00:30.300> different<00:00:30.720> it's<00:00:31.080> the<00:00:31.260> 7th<00:00:31.679> instead

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:31.890 
note is different it's the 7th instead

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:36.680 
note is different it's the 7th instead
of<00:00:32.430> d<00:00:32.700> sharp<00:00:33.030> air<00:00:33.360> it's<00:00:34.320> d<00:00:34.850> so<00:00:35.850> you<00:00:35.940> can<00:00:36.149> think<00:00:36.180> a

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:36.690 
of d sharp air it's d so you can think a

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:39.650 
of d sharp air it's d so you can think a
mixolydian<00:00:37.410> mode<00:00:37.620> is<00:00:38.070> a<00:00:38.129> major<00:00:38.550> scale<00:00:38.969> with

00:00:39.650 --> 00:00:39.660 
mixolydian mode is a major scale with

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:42.500 
mixolydian mode is a major scale with
the<00:00:39.840> seventh<00:00:40.350> one<00:00:41.010> half<00:00:41.370> step<00:00:41.579> low<00:00:41.969> another

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:42.510 
the seventh one half step low another

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:43.910 
the seventh one half step low another
way<00:00:42.690> to<00:00:42.750> think<00:00:42.840> about<00:00:43.079> the<00:00:43.320> mixolydian<00:00:43.710> mode

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:43.920 
way to think about the mixolydian mode

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:46.160 
way to think about the mixolydian mode
is<00:00:44.280> to<00:00:44.610> think<00:00:44.879> about<00:00:44.969> a<00:00:45.149> major<00:00:45.510> scale<00:00:45.899> starting

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:46.170 
is to think about a major scale starting

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:50.389 
is to think about a major scale starting
on<00:00:47.010> its<00:00:47.219> 5th<00:00:47.430> degree<00:00:47.610> e<00:00:48.059> is<00:00:49.020> the<00:00:49.079> fifth<00:00:49.530> ave<00:00:49.710> so

00:00:50.389 --> 00:00:50.399 
on its 5th degree e is the fifth ave so

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:52.790 
on its 5th degree e is the fifth ave so
ii<00:00:50.730> mixolydian<00:00:51.480> mode<00:00:51.690> and<00:00:52.050> the<00:00:52.199> a<00:00:52.230> major<00:00:52.649> scale

00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:52.800 
ii mixolydian mode and the a major scale

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:54.590 
ii mixolydian mode and the a major scale
are<00:00:53.190> actually<00:00:53.610> the<00:00:53.730> same<00:00:53.760> they<00:00:54.090> have<00:00:54.239> the<00:00:54.390> same

00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:54.600 
are actually the same they have the same

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:59.630 
are actually the same they have the same
notes<00:00:54.960> here's<00:00:55.680> a<00:00:55.890> major<00:00:58.430> here's<00:00:59.430> the

00:00:59.630 --> 00:00:59.640 
notes here's a major here's the

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:04.850 
notes here's a major here's the
mixolydian<00:01:02.539> same<00:01:03.539> notes<00:01:03.809> just<00:01:04.350> starting<00:01:04.710> in<00:01:04.799> a

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:04.860 
mixolydian same notes just starting in a

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:07.160 
mixolydian same notes just starting in a
different<00:01:05.220> place<00:01:05.339> here's<00:01:06.240> what<00:01:06.510> I<00:01:06.720> mixolydian

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:07.170 
different place here's what I mixolydian

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:25.560 
different place here's what I mixolydian
sounds

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:25.570 

00:01:25.570 --> 00:01:27.880 

as<00:01:26.570> you<00:01:26.750> can<00:01:26.840> hear<00:01:26.900> it<00:01:27.110> has<00:01:27.230> a<00:01:27.260> little<00:01:27.500> bit<00:01:27.710> of<00:01:27.770> a

00:01:27.880 --> 00:01:27.890 
as you can hear it has a little bit of a

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:30.160 
as you can hear it has a little bit of a
Celtic<00:01:28.340> feel<00:01:28.610> to<00:01:28.910> it<00:01:28.940> it's<00:01:29.450> a<00:01:29.600> little<00:01:29.750> bit<00:01:29.870> blue

00:01:30.160 --> 00:01:30.170 
Celtic feel to it it's a little bit blue

sea as well a lot of people use the

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:39.820 
sea as well a lot of people use the
mixolydian<00:01:38.510> mode<00:01:38.750> when<00:01:39.140> they're<00:01:39.260> playing<00:01:39.440> in
