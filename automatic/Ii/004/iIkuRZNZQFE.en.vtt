00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:36.090 
wine was a better individual goal and

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:38.959 
wine was a better individual goal and

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:43.620 
it was a just a great great Bell to be

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:45.920 
it was a just a great great Bell to be
fer<00:00:43.800> James<00:00:44.670> Henry's<00:00:45.030> go<00:00:45.180> top<00:00:45.390> corner<00:00:45.750> with<00:00:45.870> his

fer James Henry's go top corner with his
weaker<00:00:46.110> foot<00:00:46.410> don't<00:00:47.309> score<00:00:47.520> a<00:00:47.550> lot<00:00:47.789> of<00:00:47.879> them

00:00:47.959 --> 00:00:47.969

weaker foot don't score a lot of them
saying<00:00:48.750> that<00:00:48.870> I've<00:00:49.170> been<00:00:50.059> saying<00:00:51.059> that<00:00:51.300> to<00:00:51.420> be

00:00:51.529 --> 00:00:51.539 
saying that I've been saying that to be

00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:53.510 
saying that I've been saying that to be
fair<00:00:51.750> it's<00:00:52.199> called<00:00:52.410> a<00:00:52.469> bag<00:00:52.620> negates<00:00:52.949> bowling<00:00:53.340> I

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:53.520 
fair it's called a bag negates bowling I

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:55.670 
fair it's called a bag negates bowling I
was<00:00:53.940> with<00:00:54.000> your<00:00:54.149> strong<00:00:54.360> so<00:00:54.809> he's<00:00:55.289> got<00:00:55.469> in<00:00:55.620> the

00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:55.680 
was with your strong so he's got in the

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:57.889 
was with your strong so he's got in the
locker<00:00:55.860> but<00:00:56.070> I'd<00:00:56.250> say<00:00:56.489> my<00:00:57.300> goal<00:00:57.510> was<00:00:57.600> probably

00:00:57.889 --> 00:00:57.899 
locker but I'd say my goal was probably

00:00:57.899 --> 00:00:59.420 
locker but I'd say my goal was probably
a<00:00:57.960> hard<00:00:58.140> a<00:00:58.199> technique<00:00:58.590> but<00:00:58.890> the<00:00:59.219> one<00:00:59.340> that

00:00:59.420 --> 00:00:59.430 
a hard a technique but the one that

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:00.920 
a hard a technique but the one that
looks<00:00:59.609> better<00:00:59.760> for<00:01:00.239> the<00:01:00.300> fans<00:01:00.510> would<00:01:00.629> probably

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:00.930 
looks better for the fans would probably

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:02.750 
looks better for the fans would probably
be<00:01:01.050> James<00:01:01.260> Henry's<00:01:01.620> and<00:01:01.829> I<00:01:02.010> think<00:01:02.489> you<00:01:02.579> would

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:02.760 
be James Henry's and I think you would

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:04.820 
be James Henry's and I think you would
but<00:01:03.539> as<00:01:03.660> I've<00:01:03.780> said<00:01:03.809> before<00:01:03.960> I<00:01:04.409> don't<00:01:04.710> care

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:04.830 
but as I've said before I don't care

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:06.950 
but as I've said before I don't care
they<00:01:05.010> go<00:01:05.159> in<00:01:05.280> as<00:01:05.369> long<00:01:05.519> as<00:01:05.640> they<00:01:05.729> go<00:01:05.850> in<00:01:05.970> and<00:01:06.330> as

they go in as long as they go in and as

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:08.960 
they go in as long as they go in and as
