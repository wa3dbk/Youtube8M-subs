there's a heat shield and we move the
exhaust<00:00:25.439> that<00:00:25.710> way<00:00:25.920> so<00:00:25.980> it<00:00:26.220> can<00:00:26.310> cut<00:00:26.519> the<00:00:26.670> heat

00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:26.820 
exhaust that way so it can cut the heat

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:28.550 
exhaust that way so it can cut the heat
shield<00:00:27.060> out<00:00:27.210> of<00:00:27.300> the<00:00:27.390> way<00:00:27.510> we're<00:00:28.289> look<00:00:28.410> at<00:00:28.470> the

repeat<00:01:53.090> the<00:01:53.179> same<00:01:53.329> process<00:01:53.539> for<00:01:53.810> remaining

00:01:54.279 --> 00:01:54.289 
repeat the same process for remaining

00:01:54.289 --> 00:01:57.460 
repeat the same process for remaining
three<00:01:54.590> holes<00:01:55.989> we're<00:01:56.989> looking<00:01:57.200> underneath<00:01:57.380> the

00:01:57.460 --> 00:01:57.470 
three holes we're looking underneath the

00:01:57.470 --> 00:01:58.990 
three holes we're looking underneath the
truck<00:01:57.560> now<00:01:57.890> now<00:01:58.280> we<00:01:58.340> can<00:01:58.520> see<00:01:58.670> the<00:01:58.819> two<00:01:58.970> holes

00:01:58.990 --> 00:01:59.000 
truck now now we can see the two holes

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:01.240 
truck now now we can see the two holes
that<00:01:59.270> we<00:01:59.420> just<00:01:59.450> drilled<00:01:59.630> out<00:02:00.020> now<00:02:01.009> I'll<00:02:01.130> go

00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:01.250 
that we just drilled out now I'll go

00:02:01.250 --> 00:02:02.620 
that we just drilled out now I'll go
ahead<00:02:01.280> and<00:02:01.489> hold<00:02:01.670> the<00:02:01.759> bracket<00:02:01.970> up<00:02:02.239> there<00:02:02.450> and

00:02:02.620 --> 00:02:02.630 
ahead and hold the bracket up there and

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:04.539 
ahead and hold the bracket up there and
see<00:02:03.079> how<00:02:03.229> everything<00:02:03.530> is<00:02:03.590> going<00:02:03.619> to<00:02:03.799> fit<00:02:04.399> into

00:02:04.539 --> 00:02:04.549 
see how everything is going to fit into

00:02:04.549 --> 00:02:07.270 
see how everything is going to fit into
place<00:02:05.020> and<00:02:06.020> let's<00:02:06.229> just<00:02:06.380> kind<00:02:06.619> of<00:02:06.679> line<00:02:07.250> them

00:02:07.270 --> 00:02:07.280 
place and let's just kind of line them

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:10.569 
place and let's just kind of line them
up<00:02:07.520> roughly<00:02:08.470> so<00:02:09.470> it<00:02:09.709> looks<00:02:09.890> like<00:02:09.979> the<00:02:10.160> brackets

00:02:10.569 --> 00:02:10.579 
up roughly so it looks like the brackets

00:02:10.579 --> 00:02:12.789 
up roughly so it looks like the brackets
going<00:02:10.700> to<00:02:10.759> use<00:02:10.849> this<00:02:10.970> existing<00:02:11.239> hole<00:02:11.599> here<00:02:11.799> and

00:02:12.789 --> 00:02:12.799 
going to use this existing hole here and

00:02:12.799 --> 00:02:15.460 
going to use this existing hole here and
looks<00:02:13.579> like<00:02:13.640> we<00:02:13.819> can<00:02:13.970> you<00:02:14.120> bolt<00:02:14.360> it<00:02:14.510> or<00:02:15.049> we<00:02:15.319> can

00:02:15.460 --> 00:02:15.470 
looks like we can you bolt it or we can

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:17.199 
looks like we can you bolt it or we can
actually<00:02:15.650> bolt<00:02:16.099> it<00:02:16.220> into<00:02:16.340> place<00:02:16.610> here<00:02:16.880> as<00:02:17.000> well

might be hard to get around and you

00:03:15.569 --> 00:03:17.809 
might be hard to get around and you
really<00:03:15.870> can't<00:03:16.110> get<00:03:16.410> to<00:03:16.560> it<00:03:16.590> very<00:03:16.709> easily<00:03:16.920> we'll

00:03:17.809 --> 00:03:17.819 
really can't get to it very easily we'll

need<00:05:55.310> two<00:05:55.430> blocks<00:05:55.849> on<00:05:56.150> the<00:05:56.270> top<00:05:56.449> because<00:05:56.840> the

00:05:56.920 --> 00:05:56.930 
need two blocks on the top because the

00:05:56.930 --> 00:05:58.510 
need two blocks on the top because the
corrugation<00:05:57.530> is<00:05:57.770> going<00:05:58.009> towards<00:05:58.250> the<00:05:58.280> top<00:05:58.490> and
