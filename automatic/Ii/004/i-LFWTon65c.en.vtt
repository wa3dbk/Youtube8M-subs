getting new helmets fell the helmet is

00:02:33.519 --> 00:02:35.130 
getting new helmets fell the helmet is
on<00:02:33.730> the<00:02:33.850> pricier<00:02:34.299> side<00:02:34.330> i<00:02:34.600> believe<00:02:34.870> they<00:02:35.019> go

00:02:35.130 --> 00:02:35.140 
on the pricier side i believe they go

for<00:02:35.319> 550<00:02:36.720> but<00:02:37.720> i<00:02:38.110> think<00:02:39.100> you<00:02:39.370> have<00:02:39.610> to<00:02:39.730> ask

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:39.790 
for 550 but i think you have to ask

00:02:39.790 --> 00:02:41.880 
for 550 but i think you have to ask
yourself<00:02:40.000> how<00:02:40.420> much<00:02:40.569> is<00:02:40.780> your<00:02:40.810> head<00:02:41.080> wharf<00:02:41.350> and

00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:41.890 
yourself how much is your head wharf and
