 place and little left over for the safety of the house 

00:00:16.189 --> 00:00:20.509
 to change this framework, insurers have invested in different plans to 

00:00:20.509 --> 00:00:24.839
 The idea is to win over consumers who have little to invest but before 

00:00:24.839 --> 00:00:28.050

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:49.310
 700 

00:00:49.310 --> 00:00:53.710
 and most appliances once they had been damaged were left 

00:00:53.710 --> 00:00:59.370
 forward the reports of the insurer's penalty, and therein is the insurer 

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:04.880

 but the sector has been growing at a rate of 20% a year since 2003 

00:01:12.160 --> 00:01:16.540

00:01:16.540 --> 00:01:21.560

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:47.030
