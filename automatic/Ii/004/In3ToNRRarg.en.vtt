00:01:29.149 --> 00:01:29.159 
their next meal so you're probably going

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:31.429 
their next meal so you're probably going
to<00:01:29.220> get<00:01:29.310> some<00:01:29.720> astronaut-type<00:01:30.720> zombies

00:01:31.429 --> 00:01:31.439 
to get some astronaut-type zombies

00:01:31.439 --> 00:01:32.420 
to get some astronaut-type zombies
whether<00:01:31.650> that's<00:01:31.860> an<00:01:32.009> action<00:01:32.280> news

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:32.430 
whether that's an action news

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:34.280 
whether that's an action news
zombie-type<00:01:32.909> or<00:01:33.479> it's<00:01:33.570> just<00:01:33.780> a<00:01:33.840> new<00:01:33.930> skin<00:01:34.259> for

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:34.290 
zombie-type or it's just a new skin for

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:37.789 
zombie-type or it's just a new skin for
the<00:01:34.560> zombies<00:01:34.920> will<00:01:35.869> see<00:01:36.869> on<00:01:36.990> the<00:01:37.020> map<00:01:37.229> pack<00:01:37.500> but

00:01:37.789 --> 00:01:37.799 
the zombies will see on the map pack but

00:01:37.799 --> 00:01:38.870 
the zombies will see on the map pack but
until<00:01:38.070> then<00:01:38.220> they<00:01:38.369> don't<00:01:38.460> really<00:01:38.610> give<00:01:38.790> us

00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:38.880 
until then they don't really give us

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:41.060 
until then they don't really give us
much<00:01:39.030> detail<00:01:39.530> unaffected<00:01:40.530> by<00:01:40.650> the<00:01:40.710> base<00:01:40.920> is

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:41.070 
much detail unaffected by the base is

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:44.810 
much detail unaffected by the base is
fluctuating<00:01:41.400> gravity<00:01:42.000> so<00:01:42.960> that<00:01:43.920> means<00:01:44.460> that

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:44.820 
fluctuating gravity so that means that

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:48.170 
fluctuating gravity so that means that
the<00:01:45.479> gravity<00:01:45.990> it<00:01:46.680> may<00:01:47.310> actually<00:01:47.670> not<00:01:48.119> even

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:48.180 
the gravity it may actually not even

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:50.030 
the gravity it may actually not even
depend<00:01:48.659> on<00:01:48.869> the<00:01:48.960> area<00:01:49.290> in<00:01:49.590> but<00:01:49.799> it<00:01:49.890> might

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:50.040 
depend on the area in but it might

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:52.609 
depend on the area in but it might
actually<00:01:50.310> like<00:01:50.729> flip<00:01:51.420> up<00:01:51.630> and<00:01:51.750> down<00:01:51.990> the

actually like flip up and down the

00:01:52.619 --> 00:01:54.109 
actually like flip up and down the
gravity<00:01:52.950> might<00:01:53.100> change<00:01:53.490> during<00:01:53.880> certain

00:01:54.109 --> 00:01:54.119 
gravity might change during certain

00:01:54.119 --> 00:01:57.170 
gravity might change during certain
points<00:01:54.570> so<00:01:54.979> obviously<00:01:55.979> we're<00:01:56.670> going<00:01:56.880> to<00:01:56.969> see

00:01:57.170 --> 00:01:57.180 
points so obviously we're going to see

00:01:57.180 --> 00:02:00.319 
points so obviously we're going to see
different<00:01:57.899> gravity<00:01:58.560> amounts<00:01:58.950> now<00:01:59.219> that<00:02:00.090> might

00:02:00.319 --> 00:02:00.329 
different gravity amounts now that might

00:02:00.329 --> 00:02:02.870 
different gravity amounts now that might
get<00:02:00.630> gimmicky<00:02:01.110> again<00:02:01.740> depending<00:02:02.280> on<00:02:02.399> how<00:02:02.670> its

00:02:02.870 --> 00:02:02.880 
get gimmicky again depending on how its

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:05.030 
get gimmicky again depending on how its
implemented<00:02:03.240> but<00:02:03.600> knowing<00:02:04.259> treyarch<00:02:04.619> they're

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:05.040 
implemented but knowing treyarch they're

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:06.740 
implemented but knowing treyarch they're
going<00:02:05.159> to<00:02:05.219> do<00:02:05.310> their<00:02:05.490> best<00:02:05.640> to<00:02:05.909> make<00:02:06.570> it<00:02:06.600> work

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:06.750 
going to do their best to make it work

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:08.540 
going to do their best to make it work
and<00:02:07.170> kind<00:02:07.439> of<00:02:07.560> keep<00:02:07.799> the<00:02:07.950> core<00:02:08.129> zombie

00:02:08.540 --> 00:02:08.550 
and kind of keep the core zombie

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:11.360 
and kind of keep the core zombie
gameplay<00:02:09.209> intact<00:02:09.720> so<00:02:10.470> I'm<00:02:10.679> interested<00:02:11.160> to<00:02:11.190> see

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:11.370 
gameplay intact so I'm interested to see

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:13.460 
gameplay intact so I'm interested to see
how<00:02:11.489> that<00:02:11.640> works<00:02:11.760> out<00:02:12.030> and<00:02:12.180> apparently<00:02:12.629> a<00:02:12.660> lot

00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:13.470 
how that works out and apparently a lot

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:15.050 
how that works out and apparently a lot
knots<00:02:13.680> are<00:02:13.890> some<00:02:14.190> kind<00:02:14.400> of<00:02:14.430> special<00:02:14.640> zombie

00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:15.060 
knots are some kind of special zombie

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:16.490 
knots are some kind of special zombie
should<00:02:15.630> have<00:02:15.720> read<00:02:15.840> the<00:02:15.870> last<00:02:16.110> part<00:02:16.290> of<00:02:16.380> the

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:18.890 
should have read the last part of the
sentence<00:02:16.860> so<00:02:17.180> apparently<00:02:18.180> they<00:02:18.390> have<00:02:18.750> no

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:18.900 
sentence so apparently they have no

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:20.530

arm<00:02:21.540> yourself<00:02:21.870> with<00:02:21.930> space-age<00:02:22.440> arsenal<00:02:22.980> of

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:27.620

which<00:02:25.830> is<00:02:25.980> the<00:02:26.100> new<00:02:26.220> Wonder<00:02:26.520> weapon<00:02:26.640> capable

00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:27.630 
which is the new Wonder weapon capable

00:02:27.630 --> 00:02:29.030 
which is the new Wonder weapon capable
of<00:02:27.720> cooking<00:02:27.960> zombies<00:02:28.500> from<00:02:28.620> the<00:02:28.770> inside<00:02:29.010> out

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:29.040 
of cooking zombies from the inside out

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:32.120 
of cooking zombies from the inside out
so<00:02:29.430> it<00:02:29.520> probably<00:02:29.790> just<00:02:30.060> needs<00:02:30.560> the<00:02:31.560> thundergun

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:32.130 
so it probably just needs the thundergun

so it probably just needs the thundergun
type<00:02:32.460> blast<00:02:32.820> or<00:02:33.120> something<00:02:33.510> and<00:02:33.600> it's<00:02:33.750> just

00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:33.900 
type blast or something and it's just

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:36.230 
type blast or something and it's just
the<00:02:34.350> zombies<00:02:34.710> just<00:02:34.890> kind<00:02:35.100> of<00:02:35.160> dissolved<00:02:36.150> in

00:03:41.910 --> 00:03:44.390

times points like that I'm hoping it's

00:03:47.850 --> 00:03:50.240

some<00:03:48.090> extra<00:03:48.900> weapon<00:03:49.350> slot<00:03:49.620> that<00:03:49.920> would<00:03:50.070> be

00:03:50.240 --> 00:03:50.250 
some extra weapon slot that would be

00:03:50.250 --> 00:03:53.000 
some extra weapon slot that would be
amazing<00:03:51.120> that<00:03:51.989> would<00:03:52.110> be<00:03:52.230> by<00:03:52.380> far<00:03:52.620> my<00:03:52.830> favorite

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:53.010 
amazing that would be by far my favorite

00:03:53.010 --> 00:03:56.300 
amazing that would be by far my favorite
perk<00:03:53.310> and<00:03:54.080> maybe<00:03:55.080> three<00:03:55.410> times<00:03:55.560> animal

00:03:56.300 --> 00:03:56.310

00:03:56.310 --> 00:03:58.580

capacity<00:03:56.820> on<00:03:56.940> them<00:03:57.090> I<00:03:57.299> guess<00:03:57.900> so<00:03:58.140> we'll<00:03:58.380> see

00:03:58.580 --> 00:03:58.590 
capacity on them I guess so we'll see

00:03:58.590 --> 00:04:00.229 
capacity on them I guess so we'll see
you'll<00:03:59.100> have<00:03:59.250> the<00:03:59.370> tools<00:03:59.549> you<00:03:59.730> need<00:03:59.880> to<00:03:59.910> turn

00:04:00.229 --> 00:04:00.239 
you'll have the tools you need to turn

00:04:00.239 --> 00:04:02.270 
you'll have the tools you need to turn
back<00:04:00.510> the<00:04:00.750> undead<00:04:01.080> tied<00:04:01.320> once<00:04:01.560> and<00:04:01.709> for<00:04:01.860> all<00:04:01.890> so

00:04:02.270 --> 00:04:02.280 
back the undead tied once and for all so

00:04:02.280 --> 00:04:04.009 
back the undead tied once and for all so
the<00:04:02.820> way<00:04:02.940> they're<00:04:03.120> talking<00:04:03.480> about<00:04:03.660> this<00:04:03.810> it

00:04:04.009 --> 00:04:04.019 
the way they're talking about this it

00:04:04.019 --> 00:04:06.080 
the way they're talking about this it
really<00:04:04.170> sounds<00:04:04.650> like<00:04:04.680> it's<00:04:05.070> going<00:04:05.519> to<00:04:05.730> be<00:04:05.850> the

00:04:06.080 --> 00:04:06.090 
really sounds like it's going to be the

00:04:06.090 --> 00:04:08.180 
really sounds like it's going to be the
last<00:04:06.510> saw<00:04:06.750> be<00:04:06.900> mad<00:04:07.049> for<00:04:07.260> black<00:04:07.560> ops<00:04:07.739> which<00:04:08.070> is

00:04:08.180 --> 00:04:08.190 
last saw be mad for black ops which is

00:04:08.190 --> 00:04:10.970 
last saw be mad for black ops which is
unfortunate<00:04:08.820> but<00:04:09.260> for<00:04:10.260> map<00:04:10.440> packs<00:04:10.709> is<00:04:10.920> a

00:04:10.970 --> 00:04:10.980 
unfortunate but for map packs is a

00:04:10.980 --> 00:04:13.160 
unfortunate but for map packs is a
record<00:04:11.280> for<00:04:11.430> any<00:04:11.700> call<00:04:11.940> duty<00:04:12.150> game<00:04:12.390> so<00:04:12.690> I<00:04:12.900> guess

00:04:13.160 --> 00:04:13.170 
record for any call duty game so I guess

00:04:13.170 --> 00:04:15.920 
record for any call duty game so I guess
they<00:04:13.350> kind<00:04:13.709> of<00:04:13.799> had<00:04:13.950> their<00:04:14.070> fair<00:04:14.190> share<00:04:14.360> so<00:04:15.360> in

00:04:15.920 --> 00:04:15.930 
they kind of had their fair share so in

00:04:15.930 --> 00:04:17.570 
they kind of had their fair share so in
addition<00:04:16.019> to<00:04:16.290> the<00:04:16.500> final<00:04:16.830> chapter<00:04:17.040> residue

there<00:04:53.940> isn't<00:04:54.270> really<00:04:54.420> much<00:04:54.540> detail<00:04:55.500> provided

00:04:55.760 --> 00:04:55.770 
there isn't really much detail provided

there isn't really much detail provided
in<00:04:56.190> this<00:04:56.310> picture<00:04:56.670> but<00:04:56.910> from<00:04:57.060> what<00:04:57.120> it<00:04:57.330> sounds

00:04:57.440 --> 00:04:57.450 
in this picture but from what it sounds

00:04:57.450 --> 00:04:59.630 
in this picture but from what it sounds
like<00:04:57.630> yeah<00:04:58.500> you<00:04:58.560> just<00:04:58.800> shoot<00:04:59.040> them<00:04:59.160> and<00:04:59.460> all

00:04:59.630 --> 00:04:59.640 
like yeah you just shoot them and all

00:04:59.640 --> 00:05:00.890 
like yeah you just shoot them and all
the<00:04:59.760> zombies<00:04:59.880> in<00:05:00.240> front<00:05:00.420> you<00:05:00.480> just<00:05:00.660> kind<00:05:00.840> of

00:05:00.890 --> 00:05:00.900 
the zombies in front you just kind of

00:05:00.900 --> 00:05:05.180 
the zombies in front you just kind of
like<00:05:01.880> sizzle<00:05:02.880> and<00:05:02.970> die<00:05:03.450> which<00:05:04.260> could<00:05:04.890> be<00:05:05.010> quite

00:05:05.180 --> 00:05:05.190 
like sizzle and die which could be quite

00:05:05.190 --> 00:05:07.580 
like sizzle and die which could be quite
effective<00:05:05.310> I<00:05:05.790> can<00:05:06.690> imagine<00:05:06.780> it<00:05:07.170> sounds<00:05:07.470> like

00:05:07.580 --> 00:05:07.590 
effective I can imagine it sounds like

00:05:07.590 --> 00:05:09.620 
effective I can imagine it sounds like
it's<00:05:07.800> going<00:05:07.980> to<00:05:08.100> be<00:05:08.190> a<00:05:08.220> great<00:05:08.790> break<00:05:09.210> training

00:05:09.620 --> 00:05:09.630 
it's going to be a great break training

00:05:09.630 --> 00:05:15.440 
it's going to be a great break training
gun<00:05:09.810> and<00:05:11.090> over<00:05:12.090> here<00:05:12.420> is<00:05:12.800> the<00:05:14.450> quantum

00:05:15.450 --> 00:05:19.070 
gun and over here is the quantum
entanglement<00:05:16.230> device<00:05:16.640> now<00:05:17.640> the<00:05:18.630> reason<00:05:18.810> I

00:05:19.070 --> 00:05:19.080 
entanglement device now the reason I

00:05:19.080 --> 00:05:21.890 
entanglement device now the reason I
think<00:05:19.290> it<00:05:19.440> well<00:05:20.130> this<00:05:20.820> obvious<00:05:21.210> it<00:05:21.390> goes<00:05:21.690> with

00:05:21.890 --> 00:05:21.900 
think it well this obvious it goes with

00:05:21.900 --> 00:05:23.690 
think it well this obvious it goes with
the<00:05:21.930> quantum<00:05:22.140> entangle<00:05:22.740> theory<00:05:23.010> but<00:05:23.190> the

00:05:23.690 --> 00:05:23.700 
the quantum entangle theory but the

00:05:23.700 --> 00:05:25.070 
the quantum entangle theory but the
reason<00:05:23.880> furthermore<00:05:24.450> is<00:05:24.570> because<00:05:24.810> it<00:05:24.900> kind<00:05:25.050> of

00:05:25.070 --> 00:05:25.080 
reason furthermore is because it kind of

00:05:25.080 --> 00:05:26.660 
reason furthermore is because it kind of
looks<00:05:25.260> like<00:05:25.320> it's<00:05:25.530> divided<00:05:26.040> into<00:05:26.130> two<00:05:26.460> sides

00:05:26.660 --> 00:05:26.670 
looks like it's divided into two sides

00:05:26.670 --> 00:05:28.070 
looks like it's divided into two sides
kind<00:05:27.000> of<00:05:27.090> symmetrical<00:05:27.600> if<00:05:27.720> you<00:05:27.780> divide<00:05:28.050> it

00:05:28.070 --> 00:05:28.080 
kind of symmetrical if you divide it

00:05:28.080 --> 00:05:29.570 
kind of symmetrical if you divide it
down<00:05:28.290> the<00:05:28.380> middle<00:05:28.410> you<00:05:28.980> got<00:05:29.100> like<00:05:29.250> the<00:05:29.400> left

00:05:29.570 --> 00:05:29.580 
down the middle you got like the left

00:05:29.580 --> 00:05:31.730 
down the middle you got like the left
tube<00:05:29.790> and<00:05:30.180> gift<00:05:30.600> we<00:05:30.810> got<00:05:30.930> the<00:05:31.050> right<00:05:31.170> to<00:05:31.380> ban<00:05:31.620> up

00:05:31.730 --> 00:05:31.740 
tube and gift we got the right to ban up

00:05:31.740 --> 00:05:33.140 
tube and gift we got the right to ban up
on<00:05:31.890> the<00:05:31.980> top<00:05:32.130> you<00:05:32.340> got<00:05:32.430> the<00:05:32.580> left<00:05:32.760> tube<00:05:32.940> right

00:05:33.140 --> 00:05:33.150 
on the top you got the left tube right

00:05:33.150 --> 00:05:34.700 
on the top you got the left tube right
tube<00:05:33.360> like<00:05:33.600> thing<00:05:33.870> and<00:05:34.050> they<00:05:34.110> combine<00:05:34.410> into

00:05:34.700 --> 00:05:34.710 
tube like thing and they combine into

00:05:34.710 --> 00:05:37.040 
tube like thing and they combine into
this<00:05:34.920> one<00:05:35.550> horizontal<00:05:35.820> tube<00:05:36.300> now<00:05:36.780> it<00:05:36.840> doesn't

00:05:37.040 --> 00:05:37.050 
this one horizontal tube now it doesn't

00:05:37.050 --> 00:05:38.690 
this one horizontal tube now it doesn't
look<00:05:37.080> like<00:05:37.200> a<00:05:37.350> gun<00:05:37.650> so<00:05:38.190> I'm<00:05:38.280> assuming<00:05:38.370> it's

00:05:38.690 --> 00:05:38.700 
look like a gun so I'm assuming it's

00:05:38.700 --> 00:05:39.980 
look like a gun so I'm assuming it's
either<00:05:38.940> going<00:05:39.120> to<00:05:39.180> be<00:05:39.240> an<00:05:39.330> equipment<00:05:39.630> or<00:05:39.930> a

00:05:39.980 --> 00:05:39.990 
either going to be an equipment or a

00:05:39.990 --> 00:05:43.160 
either going to be an equipment or a
tactical<00:05:40.560> grenade<00:05:41.270> how<00:05:42.270> the<00:05:42.330> equipment<00:05:42.780> thing

00:05:43.160 --> 00:05:43.170 
tactical grenade how the equipment thing

00:05:43.170 --> 00:05:44.870 
tactical grenade how the equipment thing
would<00:05:43.320> work<00:05:43.350> I<00:05:43.680> don't<00:05:43.890> really<00:05:43.980> know<00:05:44.220> maybe

00:05:44.870 --> 00:05:44.880 
would work I don't really know maybe

00:05:44.880 --> 00:05:47.150 
would work I don't really know maybe
like<00:05:45.180> it<00:05:45.810> depends<00:05:46.200> how<00:05:46.230> big<00:05:46.500> it<00:05:46.590> is<00:05:46.650> it<00:05:46.830> depends

00:05:47.150 --> 00:05:47.160 
like it depends how big it is it depends

00:05:47.160 --> 00:05:49.670 
like it depends how big it is it depends
if<00:05:47.310> this<00:05:47.460> is<00:05:47.640> like<00:05:48.450> an<00:05:48.600> actual<00:05:48.720> to<00:05:49.020> scale<00:05:49.290> model

00:05:49.670 --> 00:05:49.680 
if this is like an actual to scale model

00:05:49.680 --> 00:05:51.950 
if this is like an actual to scale model
or<00:05:49.800> if<00:05:49.890> it's<00:05:50.060> shrunken<00:05:51.060> down<00:05:51.120> a<00:05:51.270> lot<00:05:51.540> it<00:05:51.780> could

00:05:51.950 --> 00:05:51.960 
or if it's shrunken down a lot it could

00:05:51.960 --> 00:05:54.580 
or if it's shrunken down a lot it could
be<00:05:52.170> something<00:05:52.560> that's<00:05:53.070> like<00:05:53.190> Oh<00:05:53.550> No<00:05:54.210> maybe

00:05:54.580 --> 00:05:54.590 
be something that's like Oh No maybe

00:05:54.590 --> 00:05:56.990 
be something that's like Oh No maybe
foot<00:05:55.590> in<00:05:55.680> half<00:05:55.890> in<00:05:56.070> diameter<00:05:56.220> so<00:05:56.790> you<00:05:56.880> just

00:05:56.990 --> 00:05:57.000 
foot in half in diameter so you just

00:05:57.000 --> 00:05:58.190 
foot in half in diameter so you just
kind<00:05:57.150> of<00:05:57.240> drop<00:05:57.450> it<00:05:57.570> on<00:05:57.660> the<00:05:57.690> ground<00:05:57.780> and<00:05:58.050> it

00:05:58.190 --> 00:05:58.200 
kind of drop it on the ground and it

00:05:58.200 --> 00:06:00.320 
kind of drop it on the ground and it
works<00:05:58.350> like<00:05:58.500> a<00:05:58.560> bomb<00:05:58.740> like<00:05:59.040> some<00:05:59.760> kind<00:05:59.910> of<00:05:59.970> all

00:06:00.320 --> 00:06:00.330 
works like a bomb like some kind of all

00:06:00.330 --> 00:06:01.820 
works like a bomb like some kind of all
around<00:06:00.630> claim<00:06:00.870> or<00:06:01.020> maybe<00:06:01.230> like<00:06:01.380> a<00:06:01.440> bouncing

00:06:01.820 --> 00:06:01.830 
around claim or maybe like a bouncing

00:06:01.830 --> 00:06:04.430 
around claim or maybe like a bouncing
betty<00:06:01.950> or<00:06:02.630> it<00:06:03.630> could<00:06:03.870> be<00:06:03.900> just<00:06:04.020> something<00:06:04.290> you

00:06:04.430 --> 00:06:04.440 
betty or it could be just something you

00:06:04.440 --> 00:06:05.810 
betty or it could be just something you
just<00:06:04.530> toss<00:06:04.920> in<00:06:05.130> the<00:06:05.190> general<00:06:05.430> direction<00:06:05.460> of

00:06:05.810 --> 00:06:05.820 
just toss in the general direction of
