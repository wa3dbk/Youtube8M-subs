00:00:03.310 --> 00:00:07.330
 the industrialized countries during the development process no one 

00:00:07.330 --> 00:00:11.470
 destroyed forests that polluted rivers and lakes then invested fortunes 

00:00:11.470 --> 00:00:16.830
 to recover the quality of the water was thus in the nose in pairs in the states 

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:21.500
 united today perhaps with the planet no longer supports this caprice of humanity 

00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:26.259
 or is it still possible to first think about economics and growth without 

00:00:26.259 --> 00:00:30.220
 take care of the natural environment this is the subject of the program major themes of 

00:00:30.220 --> 00:00:33.220
 today who is starting 

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:42.040
 Good evening the major themes program today discusses environmental preservation 

00:00:42.040 --> 00:00:46.810
 it is possible to promote economic growth without destroying machines to pollute 

00:00:46.810 --> 00:00:50.120
 rivers and lakes, who will help us answer this question. 

00:00:50.120 --> 00:00:53.460
 questions is the planning secretary of shark engineers at 

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:57.590
 our guitarist leo goulart the procurator of the republic darlan aílton 

00:00:57.590 --> 00:01:02.650
 days, and to the public prosecutor of the abusive Valkyrie State, then they 

00:01:02.650 --> 00:01:06.140
 question that I would like to do to everyone is the following it is possible to grow 

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:08.430
 without the measure the nature 

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:10.900
 good evening everyone 

00:01:10.900 --> 00:01:13.240
 you can start 

00:01:13.240 --> 00:01:17.369
 - in fact be one of the big issues I believe and the development 

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:19.940
 since at least the industrial revolution 

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:21.590
 of course yes 

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:25.080
 that man needs space in nature 

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:29.030
 society feel the great challenge of 

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:30.000
 public is not 

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:32.500
 we all here today representatives 

00:01:32.500 --> 00:01:36.240
 is exactly the adoption of the protection measures so that this 

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:37.450
 growth 

00:01:37.450 --> 00:01:43.220
 be seen not necessarily as a competition between the boy and the 

00:01:43.220 --> 00:01:46.150
 environment but a pint and direction within what we call 

00:01:46.150 --> 00:01:49.150
 sustainable development, which is what we have 

00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:53.720
 one hour challenge that puts itself to humanity 

00:01:53.720 --> 00:01:56.170
 is sustainable development 

00:01:56.170 --> 00:01:59.780
 especially in a country that needs to develop and generate wealth 

00:01:59.780 --> 00:02:01.940
 jobs like ours 

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:03.280
 click here 

00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:07.260
 we have a greater need for industrialization this challenge placed 

00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:08.169
 everyday 

00:02:08.169 --> 00:02:11.169
 discussions of the deployment of new industries 

00:02:14.409 --> 00:02:17.589
 hydroelectric power plants 

00:02:17.589 --> 00:02:19.169
 already the steering wheel 

00:02:19.169 --> 00:02:21.799
 Good night, surely this is possible. 

00:02:21.799 --> 00:02:24.449
 so the minister sustained 

00:02:24.449 --> 00:02:28.109
 has been pursuing development and these 

00:02:28.109 --> 00:02:33.259
 he these days we have to have a vision is the vision to grow 

00:02:33.259 --> 00:02:36.419
 s glimpsing the study supports 

00:02:37.249 --> 00:02:38.969
 then this will be a factor 

00:02:38.969 --> 00:02:40.459
 what time is it? 

00:02:40.459 --> 00:02:44.540
 and what measures would these bring me which sustainable growth 

00:02:44.540 --> 00:02:47.599
 so the anatel requires that it be to the extent that measures could be taken 

00:02:47.599 --> 00:02:50.640
 - entrepreneurs by the community by the authorities 

00:02:52.299 --> 00:02:55.479
 recently so I think we started here 

00:02:55.479 --> 00:02:58.909
 It's up to you, I think everyone has to do their part without a doubt. 

00:02:58.909 --> 00:03:00.380
 I believe 

00:03:00.380 --> 00:03:04.840
 that effectively a balance we will reach there from the moment 

00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:06.259
 that we have 

00:03:06.259 --> 00:03:07.490
 consciousness 

00:03:07.490 --> 00:03:08.810
 a couple's baby 

00:03:08.810 --> 00:03:13.580
 mainly education are preservation point of view is also such a 

00:03:13.580 --> 00:03:16.760
 and it is not that we already had that level perhaps 

00:03:16.760 --> 00:03:20.489
 the performance of public agencies in the sympathy of the 

00:03:20.489 --> 00:03:23.090
 sectors if not innovate with certainty 

00:03:23.090 --> 00:03:24.839
 also needed 

00:03:24.839 --> 00:03:26.090
 Meanwhile 

00:03:26.090 --> 00:03:30.319
 I believe that we have a year with the sharing of responsibilities 

00:03:30.319 --> 00:03:33.299
 each body doing its part with respect to 

00:03:33.299 --> 00:03:35.080
 the arcon action 

00:03:35.080 --> 00:03:39.160
 in the note to the public education of private in general 

00:03:39.160 --> 00:03:41.879
 the supervisory bodies supervising 

00:03:41.879 --> 00:03:44.969
 and the federal state public ministry each in its 

00:03:44.969 --> 00:03:47.380
 the coverage area taken measures 

00:03:47.380 --> 00:03:51.289
 preventive and possibly repressive in relation to 

00:03:51.289 --> 00:03:53.729
 non-compliance with environmental standards 

00:03:53.729 --> 00:03:56.150
 pictures of a son of sarney 

00:03:56.150 --> 00:03:59.870
 speaking of the region the forecast of a shark water pollution arising 

00:03:59.870 --> 00:04:04.879
 of eject waste coal are details that are played every day in the river 

00:04:04.879 --> 00:04:06.230
 its launch 

00:04:06.230 --> 00:04:09.120
 in this issue of pollution from the sources of damage from the source of the river 

00:04:09.120 --> 00:04:10.059
 shark 

00:04:10.059 --> 00:04:11.789
 5 

00:04:11.789 --> 00:04:16.459
 for the federal public ministry in criciúma proposed already in year 93 a 

00:04:16.459 --> 00:04:19.799
 civil action against miners while the union 

00:04:19.799 --> 00:04:21.909
 to force them to recover 

00:04:21.909 --> 00:04:26.029
 the degradation left by the irresponsible mining of the car over 

00:04:26.029 --> 00:04:27.090
 decades 

00:04:27.090 --> 00:04:31.780
 only since the 1980s did the first environmental laws and 

00:04:31.780 --> 00:04:33.659
 that mining companies were 

00:04:33.659 --> 00:04:36.039
 gradually obliged to give 

00:04:36.039 --> 00:04:38.189
 take care of the environment 

00:04:38.189 --> 00:04:41.960
 to the treatment of tailings 

00:04:41.960 --> 00:04:47.400
 but in the past decades that with a trail of destruction and punishment 

00:04:47.400 --> 00:04:50.229
 that still today punishes our rivers 

00:04:50.229 --> 00:04:53.509
 mainly that the river shark rio sweet miner thousand paranagua 

00:04:55.360 --> 00:04:57.029
 through this action 

00:04:57.029 --> 00:04:59.669
 which has a sentence already of the year 2000 

00:04:59.669 --> 00:05:04.330
 these five mining companies and the union were published to recover 

00:05:04.879 --> 00:05:07.379
 these environmental liabilities 

00:05:07.379 --> 00:05:10.800
 and the infant water resources 

00:05:10.800 --> 00:05:14.400
 and we know that the way still for the recovery of water resources and 

00:05:14.400 --> 00:05:15.249
 long 

00:05:15.249 --> 00:05:17.200
 but already actions 

00:05:17.200 --> 00:05:19.809
 significant recovery 

00:05:19.809 --> 00:05:22.159
 synopsis associated 

00:05:22.159 --> 00:05:25.159
 there are actions for treatment of waste and 

00:05:26.150 --> 00:05:28.930
 I disagree that it is 

00:05:28.930 --> 00:05:32.379
 of the exact human cities as animals in a lender 

00:05:33.400 --> 00:05:35.830
 - we believe that it will be possible 

00:05:35.830 --> 00:05:38.550
 recover the quality of ocean waters 

00:05:38.550 --> 00:05:41.280
 that the socialists have already begun to be made by it 

00:05:41.280 --> 00:05:42.319
 recoverable 

00:05:42.319 --> 00:05:44.779
 Good, we estimate that nothing. 

00:05:44.779 --> 00:05:48.460
 in the coal region as a whole including here the departure of the springs 

00:05:48.459 --> 00:05:51.459
 of the shark river are 5 thousand and five hundred equitares 

00:05:51.990 --> 00:05:54.490
 degraded areas to be recovered 

00:05:54.490 --> 00:05:56.580
 of these areas 

00:05:56.580 --> 00:06:01.830
 the two military already have recovery projects completed or in me 

00:06:01.830 --> 00:06:06.830
 intersection phase but more than half of these affected areas are still missing 

00:06:06.830 --> 00:06:08.960
 this increases the riparian forest of the river 

00:06:08.960 --> 00:06:12.569
 along with these actions there is no planning because if recovered 

00:06:12.569 --> 00:06:13.110
 also 

00:06:13.110 --> 00:06:14.259
 the riparian forest 

00:06:14.259 --> 00:06:16.279
 to 6 thousand 

00:06:16.279 --> 00:06:19.710
 the question of the riparian forest of a permanent preservation area is a 

00:06:19.709 --> 00:06:22.289
 Lordship's obligation is good 

00:06:22.289 --> 00:06:27.099
 preservation in case of destruction recompose the riparian forest but this will not 

00:06:27.990 --> 00:06:31.310
 a more general question that falls within the attributions of the 

00:06:31.310 --> 00:06:37.020
 State in the specific case of coal in those places where 

00:06:37.020 --> 00:06:39.589
 there are tailings and coal deposits 

00:06:39.589 --> 00:06:43.779
 I can say that there are not a few places that have this 

00:06:43.779 --> 00:06:48.239
 situation the company has to take the issue of rejects depositing them in place 

00:06:48.239 --> 00:06:49.349
 suitable 

00:06:49.349 --> 00:06:53.349
 also by law they should speak with native species to recompose the 

00:06:53.349 --> 00:06:53.750
 riparian forest
