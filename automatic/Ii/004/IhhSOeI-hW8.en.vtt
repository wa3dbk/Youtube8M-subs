 to make the bonelli b involtini di 

00:01:19.729 --> 00:01:24.829
 sausage and zucchini therefore already in the name

00:01:28.810 --> 00:01:35.469

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:39.289
 2 zucchini 

00:01:35.469 --> 00:01:41.479
 sliced here they are the courgettes I have 

00:01:39.289 --> 00:01:44.689
 accepted with the help of a mandolin e 

00:01:41.479 --> 00:01:47.149
 I dusted them with a little salt 

00:01:44.689 --> 00:01:51.530
 in such a way that they become let's say 

00:01:47.149 --> 00:01:55.490
 then soft and shaped the app 400 g 

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:57.740
 of sausage taken from the gut 

00:01:55.490 --> 00:02:00.560
 obviously this sausage and already pre 

00:01:57.740 --> 00:02:04.450
 seasoned with salt pepper spices seeds of 

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:07.760
 fennel and anything else 2 zucchini 

00:02:04.450 --> 00:02:10.760
 cut into strips 

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:15.130
 about 30 grams of sweet provola 

00:02:10.760 --> 00:02:18.250
 diced a medium onion 

00:02:15.130 --> 00:02:23.360
 stew in a pan with a little water 

00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:26.980
 salt is a drop of oil about one 

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:31.150
 spoon of parmesan or parmesan cheese 

00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:34.820
 grated the rind of half a lemon 

00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:40.040
 grated is more spices in here 

00:02:34.820 --> 00:02:44.150
 this underlines there is rosemary a 4 5 

00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:48.530
 mint leaves is a leaf of 

00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:51.260
 sage that after twitter or some 

00:02:48.530 --> 00:02:54.860
 breadcrumbs and finally as precisely there 

00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:56.120
 we will make some skewers shipped 

00:02:54.860 --> 00:02:59.000
 I have had a wooden skewer 

00:02:56.120 --> 00:03:02.530
 the foresight to keep them half an hour in 

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:05.600
 water so then during cooking not 

00:03:02.530 --> 00:03:09.080
 blacken ok guys let's go straight to 

00:03:05.600 --> 00:03:11.600
 cooking the first thing to do is 

00:03:09.080 --> 00:03:14.660
 that of forming we say the true e 

00:03:11.600 --> 00:03:17.120
 right in the meal from our rolls 

00:03:14.660 --> 00:03:22.400
 so in this bowl there is the 

00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:26.120
 sausage we add the gra la 

00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:30.110
 sweet provola cut into cubes that you 

00:03:26.120 --> 00:03:34.060
 helps a little with the ennio spoon 

00:03:30.110 --> 00:03:34.060
 then the onion 

00:03:34.940 --> 00:03:43.540
 but we also put all the fresh spices 

00:03:39.140 --> 00:03:46.959
 which I have already slightly chopped is 

00:03:43.540 --> 00:03:50.390
 the lemon peel is very important 

00:03:46.959 --> 00:03:53.000
 grated boys the lemon put it 

00:03:50.390 --> 00:03:55.970
 for that he will donate a 

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:57.620
 let's say a sense of freshness that is in 

00:03:55.970 --> 00:04:00.500
 this in this recipe in these 

00:03:57.620 --> 00:04:02.000
 particular rolls we say is almost 

00:04:00.500 --> 00:04:05.120
 a must 

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:07.550
 ok guys in the door let's say mix 

00:04:05.120 --> 00:04:10.430
 all the ingredients initially help me 

00:04:07.550 --> 00:04:14.870
 with the spatula then I will do everything with the 

00:04:10.430 --> 00:04:17.420
 infantry good hands guys dough 

00:04:14.870 --> 00:04:20.209
 I'll show you the consistency 

00:04:17.420 --> 00:04:24.590
 do the boys very simple dough 

00:04:20.209 --> 00:04:27.350
 like a meatball, let's say tubular 

00:04:24.590 --> 00:04:30.230
 adjust with the quantity with respect to 

00:04:27.350 --> 00:04:33.970
 size let's say to the width of the 

00:04:30.230 --> 00:04:36.740
 zucchini that you obviously have to 

00:04:33.970 --> 00:04:42.230
 roll up as you see today 

00:04:36.740 --> 00:04:46.300
 compacted I take a courgette I take the 

00:04:42.230 --> 00:04:50.050
 part we say closer to the roll 

00:04:46.300 --> 00:04:54.140
 see it's not for nothing at all 

00:04:50.050 --> 00:04:57.790
 complicated then compact a little resume 

00:04:54.140 --> 00:05:00.770
 the other skewer I had already made 

00:04:57.790 --> 00:05:02.810
 ok and close 

00:05:00.770 --> 00:05:04.970
 obviously then he has the foresight of 

00:05:02.810 --> 00:05:09.290
 crush the roulades a little bit 

00:05:04.970 --> 00:05:11.750
 They are practically ready after ok 

00:05:09.290 --> 00:05:16.090
 so with the doses from you antonio is 

00:05:11.750 --> 00:05:19.130
 managed to achieve exactly 6 

00:05:16.090 --> 00:05:21.860
 so I think that rolls with an eye I think 

00:05:19.130 --> 00:05:24.169
 three people eat us quietly 

00:05:21.860 --> 00:05:26.780
 with doses from you I remind you that how 

00:05:24.169 --> 00:05:27.560
 you will always find all the doses in the info 

00:05:26.780 --> 00:05:29.780
 box 

00:05:27.560 --> 00:05:34.700
 at this point in the most manner 

00:05:29.780 --> 00:05:38.540
 simple and fast as possible sprinkle 

00:05:34.700 --> 00:05:40.560
 the rolls with breadcrumbs here 

00:05:38.540 --> 00:05:45.020
 here you don't have to do a 

00:05:40.560 --> 00:05:48.210
 particular precision work and yes 

00:05:45.020 --> 00:05:49.230
 place on baking sheet or plate 

00:05:48.210 --> 00:05:52.200
 from oven 

00:05:49.230 --> 00:05:57.840
 behold, wait until I put everything here 

00:05:52.200 --> 00:06:03.840
 in favor of camera here I put 

00:05:57.840 --> 00:06:07.800
 just a little oil that years is enough 

00:06:03.840 --> 00:06:11.180
 so it's more than enough and I do 

00:06:07.800 --> 00:06:15.330
 bake it exactly for 

00:06:11.180 --> 00:06:17.040
 half an hour with a temperature of about 180 

00:06:15.330 --> 00:06:21.690
 190 degrees 

00:06:17.040 --> 00:06:25.650
 ok guys the recipe ends here i want 

00:06:21.690 --> 00:06:27.900

00:06:25.650 --> 00:06:31.290
 we see too much for the presentation of 

00:06:27.900 --> 00:06:33.419
 flat afterwards, guys, I pulled 

00:06:31.290 --> 00:06:36.389

00:06:39.750 --> 00:06:46.860
 which are also very good to taste is 

00:06:43.410 --> 00:06:49.020
 a recipe we say rich so maybe 

00:06:46.860 --> 00:06:52.740
 does not offer recipes for every day 

00:06:49.020 --> 00:06:54.690
 but why not in quite a nice lunch 

00:06:52.740 --> 00:06:57.510

 morsels making small pieces 

00:07:02.490 --> 00:07:07.640
