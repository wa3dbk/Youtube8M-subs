00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:53.730 
you leave it on too long it can turn

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:56.450 
you leave it on too long it can turn
your<00:00:53.910> hair<00:00:54.059> purple<00:00:54.510> however<00:00:55.440> if<00:00:55.710> you<00:00:55.860> do<00:00:56.160> turn

00:00:56.450 --> 00:00:56.460

your hair purple however if you do turn
it<00:00:56.610> purple<00:00:57.000> it's<00:00:57.539> fine<00:00:58.020> because<00:00:58.440> it's

00:00:58.580 --> 00:00:58.590 
it purple it's fine because it's

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:01.430 
it purple it's fine because it's
temporary<00:00:58.920> and<00:00:59.579> actually<00:01:00.090> the<00:01:00.239> day<00:01:00.449> after<00:01:00.480> the

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:01.440 
temporary and actually the day after the

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:03.650 
temporary and actually the day after the
purple<00:01:01.949> washes<00:01:02.309> out<00:01:02.430> it's<00:01:02.699> really<00:01:03.270> really

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:03.660

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:35.070 
you can it doesn't always save but

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:36.800 
you can it doesn't always save but
sometimes<00:01:35.400> it<00:01:35.520> does<00:01:35.670> and<00:01:35.700> it<00:01:35.909> looks<00:01:36.180> like<00:01:36.479> this

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:36.810 
sometimes it does and it looks like this

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:38.240 
sometimes it does and it looks like this
is<00:01:36.960> still<00:01:37.200> clear<00:01:37.500> so<00:01:37.680> it<00:01:37.770> looks<00:01:37.950> like<00:01:38.100> I'm

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:38.250 
is still clear so it looks like I'm

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:38.870 
is still clear so it looks like I'm
lucky<00:01:38.520> this<00:01:38.640> time

00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:38.880 
lucky this time

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:40.370 
lucky this time
when<00:01:39.150> you're<00:01:39.270> measuring<00:01:39.570> this<00:01:39.750> out<00:01:39.900> it's<00:01:40.079> two

00:01:40.370 --> 00:01:40.380 
when you're measuring this out it's two

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:46.490 
when you're measuring this out it's two
parts<00:01:41.150> developer<00:01:42.150> to<00:01:42.840> one<00:01:43.290> part<00:01:44.149> toner<00:01:45.229> so<00:01:46.229> it

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:46.500 
parts developer to one part toner so it

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:48.380 
parts developer to one part toner so it
really<00:01:46.649> doesn't<00:01:46.860> matter<00:01:47.100> what<00:01:47.549> you<00:01:47.759> use<00:01:47.970> to

00:02:56.929 --> 00:02:56.939 
doesn't look like it's gonna mix it to

00:02:56.939 --> 00:03:02.509 
doesn't look like it's gonna mix it to
anything<00:02:57.209> else<00:02:57.709> see<00:03:00.739> yeah<00:03:01.739> it's<00:03:01.769> just<00:03:02.250> real

00:03:02.509 --> 00:03:02.519 
anything else see yeah it's just real

00:03:02.519 --> 00:03:44.890 
anything else see yeah it's just real
jelly<00:03:04.189> let's<00:03:05.189> get<00:03:05.400> started

00:03:44.890 --> 00:03:44.900 

00:03:44.900 --> 00:03:50.119 

and<00:03:46.219> now<00:03:47.219> we<00:03:47.280> wait<00:03:48.560> see<00:03:49.560> if<00:03:49.680> you're<00:03:49.829> doing<00:03:49.980> it

00:03:50.119 --> 00:03:50.129 
and now we wait see if you're doing it

00:03:50.129 --> 00:03:52.099 
and now we wait see if you're doing it
on<00:03:50.219> multiple<00:03:50.459> layers<00:03:50.879> which<00:03:51.450> obviously<00:03:51.930> you

00:03:52.099 --> 00:03:52.109 
on multiple layers which obviously you

00:03:52.109 --> 00:03:55.970 
on multiple layers which obviously you
are<00:03:52.730> it's<00:03:53.730> hard<00:03:54.000> to<00:03:54.120> get<00:03:54.329> it<00:03:54.689> exactly<00:03:55.560> even

00:03:55.970 --> 00:03:55.980 
are it's hard to get it exactly even

00:03:55.980 --> 00:03:57.949 
are it's hard to get it exactly even
because<00:03:56.340> the<00:03:57.090> amount<00:03:57.390> of<00:03:57.450> time<00:03:57.659> that<00:03:57.689> it

00:03:57.949 --> 00:03:57.959 
because the amount of time that it

00:03:57.959 --> 00:04:00.500 
because the amount of time that it
spends<00:03:58.260> on<00:03:58.500> it<00:03:58.680> it's<00:03:58.980> gonna<00:03:59.219> turn<00:03:59.579> more<00:04:00.090> purple

00:04:00.500 --> 00:04:00.510 
spends on it it's gonna turn more purple

00:04:00.510 --> 00:04:03.440 
spends on it it's gonna turn more purple
so<00:04:01.260> but<00:04:01.890> I<00:04:01.920> tend<00:04:02.250> to<00:04:02.340> do<00:04:02.489> is<00:04:02.640> I<00:04:02.730> do<00:04:02.790> the<00:04:03.269> bottom

00:04:03.440 --> 00:04:03.450 
so but I tend to do is I do the bottom

00:04:03.450 --> 00:04:05.929 
so but I tend to do is I do the bottom
first<00:04:04.109> it's<00:04:04.500> gonna<00:04:04.680> turn<00:04:04.859> purple<00:04:05.189> more<00:04:05.609> and

00:04:05.929 --> 00:04:05.939 
first it's gonna turn purple more and

00:04:05.939 --> 00:04:09.140 
first it's gonna turn purple more and
then<00:04:06.450> I<00:04:06.810> do<00:04:07.019> the<00:04:07.379> top<00:04:07.590> and<00:04:07.920> then<00:04:08.430> I<00:04:08.519> wash<00:04:08.760> it<00:04:09.030> out

00:04:09.140 --> 00:04:09.150 
then I do the top and then I wash it out

00:04:09.150 --> 00:04:13.449 
then I do the top and then I wash it out
and<00:04:09.859> then<00:04:10.859> I'll<00:04:10.980> try<00:04:11.129> and<00:04:11.280> do<00:04:11.370> the<00:04:11.489> top<00:04:11.670> again

00:04:13.449 --> 00:04:13.459 
and then I'll try and do the top again

00:04:13.459 --> 00:04:16.670 
and then I'll try and do the top again
that's<00:04:14.459> what<00:04:14.700> I<00:04:14.730> found<00:04:15.120> works<00:04:15.329> best<00:04:15.629> for<00:04:15.750> me<00:04:15.900> in

00:04:16.670 --> 00:04:16.680 
that's what I found works best for me in

00:04:16.680 --> 00:04:18.770 
that's what I found works best for me in
about<00:04:16.859> 4<00:04:17.220> minutes<00:04:17.430> we'll<00:04:17.880> wash<00:04:18.239> this<00:04:18.389> out<00:04:18.539> and

00:04:18.770 --> 00:04:18.780 
about 4 minutes we'll wash this out and

00:04:18.780 --> 00:04:20.749 
about 4 minutes we'll wash this out and
then<00:04:18.900> we'll<00:04:19.019> see<00:04:19.169> how<00:04:19.349> it<00:04:19.500> did<00:04:19.680> see<00:04:20.430> if<00:04:20.519> we<00:04:20.609> need

00:04:20.749 --> 00:04:20.759 
then we'll see how it did see if we need

00:04:20.759 --> 00:04:22.460 
then we'll see how it did see if we need
to<00:04:20.820> do<00:04:20.940> it<00:04:21.030> again<00:04:21.180> it<00:04:21.389> definitely<00:04:21.900> took<00:04:22.109> it's<00:04:22.380> a

00:04:22.460 --> 00:04:22.470 
to do it again it definitely took it's a

00:04:22.470 --> 00:04:26.120 
to do it again it definitely took it's a
little<00:04:23.039> purple<00:04:23.910> here<00:04:24.479> but<00:04:25.470> that's<00:04:25.560> fine<00:04:25.889> cuz

00:04:26.120 --> 00:04:26.130 
little purple here but that's fine cuz

00:04:26.130 --> 00:04:28.900 
little purple here but that's fine cuz
