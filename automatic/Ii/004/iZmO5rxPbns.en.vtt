on the same level as you it's like
competition<00:01:49.910> out<00:01:50.300> like<00:01:50.479> that<00:01:50.830> is<00:01:51.830> there<00:01:52.039> a

00:01:52.059 --> 00:01:52.069 
competition out like that is there a

00:01:52.069 --> 00:01:53.979 
competition out like that is there a
difference<00:01:52.429> from<00:01:52.610> thinking<00:01:53.390> you<00:01:53.539> can<00:01:53.720> do<00:01:53.840> it

00:01:53.979 --> 00:01:53.989 
difference from thinking you can do it

00:01:53.989 --> 00:01:57.260 
difference from thinking you can do it
to<00:01:54.440> finding<00:01:54.830> out<00:01:54.979> you<00:01:55.580> can<00:01:55.729> do<00:01:55.849> it

00:01:57.260 --> 00:01:57.270 
to finding out you can do it

00:01:57.270 --> 00:01:59.160 
to finding out you can do it
yeah<00:01:58.270> there<00:01:58.450> is<00:01:58.540> kind<00:01:58.660> of<00:01:58.750> a<00:01:58.840> difference

00:01:59.160 --> 00:01:59.170 
yeah there is kind of a difference

00:01:59.170 --> 00:02:01.740 
yeah there is kind of a difference
because<00:01:59.350> like<00:01:59.670> thinking<00:02:00.670> isn't<00:02:00.910> really<00:02:01.330> doing

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:01.750 
because like thinking isn't really doing

00:02:01.750 --> 00:02:03.780 
because like thinking isn't really doing
it<00:02:02.020> it's<00:02:02.290> just<00:02:02.440> like<00:02:02.980> a<00:02:03.010> dream<00:02:03.340> but<00:02:03.550> we<00:02:03.700> just
