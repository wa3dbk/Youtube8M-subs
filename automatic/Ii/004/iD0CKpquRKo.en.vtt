00:02:58.199 --> 00:02:58.209 
way since the real Earth Summit I have

00:02:58.209 --> 00:03:00.930 
way since the real Earth Summit I have
learned<00:02:58.510> that<00:02:59.140> the<00:02:59.350> one<00:02:59.650> solution<00:03:00.250> to<00:03:00.910> our

00:03:00.930 --> 00:03:00.940 
learned that the one solution to our

00:03:00.940 --> 00:03:03.620 
learned that the one solution to our
global<00:03:01.390> problems<00:03:01.840> is<00:03:02.050> in<00:03:02.470> the<00:03:02.709> local<00:03:03.010> the

00:03:03.620 --> 00:03:03.630 
global problems is in the local the

00:03:03.630 --> 00:03:06.390 
global problems is in the local the
solutions<00:03:04.630> are<00:03:04.900> all<00:03:05.200> around<00:03:05.860> us

00:03:06.390 --> 00:03:06.400 
solutions are all around us

00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:09.390 
solutions are all around us
we<00:03:06.970> just<00:03:07.240> have<00:03:07.420> to<00:03:07.600> look<00:03:07.870> in<00:03:08.110> our<00:03:08.410> own<00:03:08.650> homes<00:03:09.070> in

00:03:09.390 --> 00:03:09.400 
we just have to look in our own homes in

00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:12.660 
we just have to look in our own homes in
our<00:03:09.640> own<00:03:09.850> communities<00:03:10.560> for<00:03:11.560> what<00:03:12.070> we<00:03:12.280> can<00:03:12.490> do

00:03:12.660 --> 00:03:12.670 
our own communities for what we can do

00:03:12.670 --> 00:03:15.630 
our own communities for what we can do
so<00:03:13.420> that<00:03:13.600> means<00:03:13.900> we<00:03:14.080> have<00:03:14.170> to<00:03:14.320> learn<00:03:14.590> from<00:03:15.070> the

00:03:15.630 --> 00:03:15.640 
so that means we have to learn from the

00:03:15.640 --> 00:03:17.310 
so that means we have to learn from the
people<00:03:16.060> that<00:03:16.090> are<00:03:16.239> around<00:03:16.540> us<00:03:16.810> we<00:03:17.019> have<00:03:17.140> to

00:03:40.620 --> 00:03:40.630 
things that we can do to make a

00:03:40.630 --> 00:03:44.300 
things that we can do to make a
difference<00:03:41.100> why<00:03:42.100> do<00:03:42.910> we<00:03:43.060> have<00:03:43.300> global<00:03:44.260> warming

00:03:44.300 --> 00:03:44.310 
difference why do we have global warming

00:03:44.310 --> 00:03:48.979 
difference why do we have global warming
why<00:03:45.310> are<00:03:45.700> we<00:03:45.940> polluting<00:03:46.450> our<00:03:46.570> oceans<00:03:47.170> why<00:03:47.950> is

00:03:48.979 --> 00:03:48.989 
why are we polluting our oceans why is

00:03:48.989 --> 00:03:52.560 
why are we polluting our oceans why is
nuclear<00:03:49.989> power<00:03:50.019> a<00:03:50.680> threat<00:03:51.130> to<00:03:51.790> our<00:03:51.820> to<00:03:52.540> our
