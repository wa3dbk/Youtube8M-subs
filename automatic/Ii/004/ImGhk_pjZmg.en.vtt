00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:12.210 
level whatever that is and I think that

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:16.609 
level whatever that is and I think that
that's<00:01:12.420> the<00:01:12.630> fine<00:01:12.840> line<00:01:13.110> that<00:01:13.670> sometimes<00:01:15.619> if

00:01:16.609 --> 00:01:16.619 
that's the fine line that sometimes if

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:19.719 
that's the fine line that sometimes if
you<00:01:16.830> can<00:01:17.009> if<00:01:17.220> you<00:01:17.430> can<00:01:17.960> relate<00:01:18.960> to<00:01:19.170> someone

00:01:19.729 --> 00:01:21.859 
you can if you can relate to someone
while<00:01:20.729> they're<00:01:20.759> having<00:01:21.060> a<00:01:21.240> struggle<00:01:21.689> I<00:01:21.840> think

00:01:21.859 --> 00:01:21.869 
while they're having a struggle I think

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:23.450 
while they're having a struggle I think
that<00:01:22.200> that's<00:01:22.350> what<00:01:22.470> people<00:01:22.740> really<00:01:22.950> need<00:01:23.280> and

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:23.460 
that that's what people really need and

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:25.700 
that that's what people really need and
want<00:01:23.670> horses<00:01:24.390> are<00:01:24.509> the<00:01:24.600> same<00:01:24.810> way<00:01:25.020> you<00:01:25.500> have<00:01:25.530> to

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:28.590 
how to be strong when they need

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:29.749 
how to be strong when they need
something<00:01:28.979> and<00:01:29.100> you<00:01:29.189> also<00:01:29.310> have<00:01:29.460> to<00:01:29.579> be<00:01:29.670> able

00:01:29.749 --> 00:01:29.759 
something and you also have to be able

00:01:29.759 --> 00:01:32.749 
something and you also have to be able
to<00:01:29.939> be<00:01:30.090> strong<00:01:30.360> or<00:01:30.840> soft<00:01:31.500> all<00:01:32.250> at<00:01:32.490> the<00:01:32.579> same

00:01:32.749 --> 00:01:32.759 
to be strong or soft all at the same

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:35.690 
to be strong or soft all at the same
time<00:01:32.820> and<00:01:33.329> so<00:01:33.479> as<00:01:34.229> a<00:01:34.320> clinician<00:01:34.680> as<00:01:34.950> a<00:01:34.979> valence

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:35.700 
time and so as a clinician as a valence

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:38.569 
time and so as a clinician as a valence
exactly<00:01:36.299> as<00:01:36.450> a<00:01:36.479> horse<00:01:36.900> trainer<00:01:36.960> I<00:01:37.890> think<00:01:38.460> when

00:01:38.569 --> 00:01:38.579 
exactly as a horse trainer I think when

00:01:38.579 --> 00:01:40.160 
exactly as a horse trainer I think when
you're<00:01:38.729> good<00:01:38.970> is<00:01:39.180> when<00:01:39.390> you<00:01:39.570> know<00:01:39.780> when<00:01:40.079> to

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:40.170 
you're good is when you know when to

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:42.050 
you're good is when you know when to
quit<00:01:40.290> and<00:01:40.619> you<00:01:40.799> know<00:01:40.979> when<00:01:41.159> to<00:01:41.189> start<00:01:41.490> and<00:01:41.820> so

00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:42.060 
quit and you know when to start and so

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:43.910 
quit and you know when to start and so
it's<00:01:42.210> just

them but not only that that when when it

00:05:08.740 --> 00:05:09.840 
them but not only that that when when it
comes<00:05:08.890> down<00:05:09.010> to<00:05:09.070> it<00:05:09.280> they're<00:05:09.430> gonna<00:05:09.520> get<00:05:09.730> the

honest answers they need and and

00:05:11.890 --> 00:05:13.350 
honest answers they need and and
sometimes<00:05:12.310> it<00:05:12.430> can<00:05:12.550> be<00:05:12.580> painful<00:05:13.030> to<00:05:13.060> hear<00:05:13.210> the

00:05:13.350 --> 00:05:13.360 
sometimes it can be painful to hear the

00:05:13.360 --> 00:05:15.420 
sometimes it can be painful to hear the
truth<00:05:13.540> but<00:05:13.840> I<00:05:14.020> think

00:05:15.420 --> 00:05:15.430 
truth but I think

00:05:15.430 --> 00:05:17.939 
truth but I think
right<00:05:16.360> I<00:05:16.389> mean<00:05:16.720> I<00:05:16.750> would<00:05:16.960> much<00:05:17.199> rather<00:05:17.229> have

00:05:17.939 --> 00:05:17.949 
right I mean I would much rather have

00:05:17.949 --> 00:05:19.439 
right I mean I would much rather have
someone<00:05:18.550> go<00:05:18.699> you<00:05:18.759> know<00:05:18.940> while<00:05:19.150> and<00:05:19.330> it's

00:05:19.439 --> 00:05:19.449 
someone go you know while and it's

00:05:19.449 --> 00:05:22.650 
someone go you know while and it's
probably<00:05:19.810> not<00:05:19.900> a<00:05:19.960> safe<00:05:20.169> idea<00:05:20.560> that<00:05:21.070> I<00:05:21.940> think

00:05:22.650 --> 00:05:22.660 
probably not a safe idea that I think

00:05:22.660 --> 00:05:24.060 
probably not a safe idea that I think
you<00:05:22.750> should<00:05:22.780> sell<00:05:23.290> this<00:05:23.410> work<00:05:23.560> to<00:05:23.680> keep<00:05:23.889> this

00:05:24.060 --> 00:05:24.070 
you should sell this work to keep this

00:05:24.070 --> 00:05:25.860 
you should sell this work to keep this
work<00:05:24.280> and<00:05:24.550> I<00:05:24.910> think<00:05:25.150> sometimes<00:05:25.360> people<00:05:25.780> are

00:05:25.860 --> 00:05:25.870 
work and I think sometimes people are

00:05:25.870 --> 00:05:27.150 
work and I think sometimes people are
looking<00:05:26.110> for<00:05:26.289> guidance<00:05:26.410> they're<00:05:26.800> looking<00:05:27.039> for

00:05:27.150 --> 00:05:27.160 
looking for guidance they're looking for

00:05:27.160 --> 00:05:29.010 
looking for guidance they're looking for
a<00:05:27.190> leader<00:05:27.460> saying<00:05:27.970> with<00:05:28.120> the<00:05:28.210> horses<00:05:28.449> so

a leader saying with the horses so

00:05:29.020 --> 00:05:30.810 
a leader saying with the horses so
