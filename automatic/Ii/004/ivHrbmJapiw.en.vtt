00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:37.660 
there's no corrosion on this unit folks
if<00:01:36.260> you<00:01:36.350> look<00:01:36.560> at<00:01:36.710> a<00:01:36.740> lot<00:01:36.950> of<00:01:36.980> campers<00:01:37.370> who<00:01:37.490> come

00:01:37.660 --> 00:01:37.670 
if you look at a lot of campers who come

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:39.400 
if you look at a lot of campers who come
from<00:01:37.790> the<00:01:37.940> East<00:01:38.090> Coast<00:01:38.180> they<00:01:38.900> get<00:01:39.050> a<00:01:39.080> lot<00:01:39.290> of

00:01:39.400 --> 00:01:39.410 
from the East Coast they get a lot of

00:01:39.410 --> 00:01:41.520 
from the East Coast they get a lot of
corrosion<00:01:39.710> on<00:01:39.980> the<00:01:40.130> lights<00:01:40.370> on<00:01:40.790> the<00:01:41.030> Beltline

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:41.530 
corrosion on the lights on the Beltline

00:01:41.530 --> 00:01:43.990 
corrosion on the lights on the Beltline
the<00:01:42.530> reason<00:01:42.890> for<00:01:43.070> that<00:01:43.250> is<00:01:43.460> because<00:01:43.490> of<00:01:43.910> the

00:01:43.990 --> 00:01:44.000 
the reason for that is because of the

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:52.730 
the reason for that is because of the
salt<00:01:44.300> out<00:01:44.600> here<00:01:45.560> we<00:01:45.710> don't<00:01:45.860> have<00:01:45.980> any<00:01:46.130> insult

00:01:52.730 --> 00:01:52.740 

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:54.980 

you<00:01:53.190> walk<00:01:53.370> on<00:01:53.580> the<00:01:53.760> interior<00:01:54.210> they<00:01:54.360> hit<00:01:54.510> it<00:01:54.659> of

00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:54.990 
you walk on the interior they hit it of

00:01:54.990 --> 00:02:00.050 
you walk on the interior they hit it of
course<00:01:55.170> you<00:01:55.380> see<00:01:55.590> the<00:01:55.619> dinette<00:01:56.190> and<00:01:58.820> back<00:01:59.820> up

00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:00.060 
course you see the dinette and back up

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:01.910 
course you see the dinette and back up
here<00:02:00.270> a<00:02:00.299> little<00:02:00.479> bit<00:02:00.659> it's<00:02:01.200> got<00:02:01.350> a<00:02:01.380> nice<00:02:01.619> big

00:02:01.910 --> 00:02:01.920 
here a little bit it's got a nice big

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:05.930 
here a little bit it's got a nice big
bed<00:02:02.720> the<00:02:03.720> bed<00:02:04.050> itself<00:02:04.440> is<00:02:04.680> 78<00:02:05.250> inches<00:02:05.640> long

00:02:05.930 --> 00:02:05.940 
bed the bed itself is 78 inches long

00:02:05.940 --> 00:02:07.760 
bed the bed itself is 78 inches long
it's<00:02:06.210> three<00:02:06.450> inches<00:02:06.690> longer<00:02:06.960> than<00:02:07.080> the<00:02:07.229> 19

it's three inches longer than the 19

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:09.290 
it's three inches longer than the 19
that's<00:02:07.950> probably<00:02:08.399> the<00:02:08.550> reason<00:02:08.700> why<00:02:08.850> I<00:02:08.970> like<00:02:09.270> it

00:02:09.290 --> 00:02:09.300 
that's probably the reason why I like it

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:11.780 
that's probably the reason why I like it
I'm<00:02:09.539> a<00:02:09.630> bigger<00:02:09.840> taller<00:02:10.110> guy<00:02:10.440> so<00:02:10.830> I<00:02:11.039> like<00:02:11.640> the

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:11.790 
I'm a bigger taller guy so I like the

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:14.059 
I'm a bigger taller guy so I like the
extra<00:02:12.209> length<00:02:12.420> the<00:02:13.050> other<00:02:13.200> thing<00:02:13.470> is<00:02:13.739> it's

00:02:14.059 --> 00:02:14.069 
extra length the other thing is it's

00:02:14.069 --> 00:02:16.100 
extra length the other thing is it's
even<00:02:14.280> longer<00:02:14.700> than<00:02:14.850> that<00:02:15.239> because<00:02:15.540> you<00:02:15.750> have

00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:16.110 
even longer than that because you have

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:18.680 
even longer than that because you have
these<00:02:16.290> bolsters<00:02:16.950> on<00:02:17.160> each<00:02:17.489> end<00:02:17.910> that<00:02:18.090> if<00:02:18.600> you

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:18.690 
these bolsters on each end that if you

00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:20.690 
these bolsters on each end that if you
pull<00:02:18.989> those<00:02:19.170> out<00:02:19.470> of<00:02:19.500> the<00:02:19.680> way<00:02:19.709> then<00:02:20.370> you<00:02:20.550> could

00:02:20.690 --> 00:02:20.700 
pull those out of the way then you could

00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:23.140 
pull those out of the way then you could
get<00:02:20.850> a<00:02:20.880> couple<00:02:21.090> extra<00:02:21.330> inches<00:02:21.720> out<00:02:22.050> of<00:02:22.170> there

00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:23.150 
get a couple extra inches out of there

00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:26.330 
get a couple extra inches out of there

think the manufacturer actually says a

00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:08.900 
think the manufacturer actually says a
little<00:03:07.049> lower<00:03:07.320> than<00:03:07.440> that<00:03:07.560> but<00:03:07.680> I<00:03:08.130> don't<00:03:08.730> know

00:03:08.900 --> 00:03:08.910 
little lower than that but I don't know

00:03:08.910 --> 00:03:10.460 
little lower than that but I don't know
I<00:03:09.090> think<00:03:09.420> it's<00:03:09.540> about<00:03:09.690> forty<00:03:10.079> five<00:03:10.200> I've

00:03:10.460 --> 00:03:10.470

entertaining and things like yet this is
definitely<00:03:43.410> something<00:03:43.829> you'll<00:03:44.070> want<00:03:44.310> it<00:03:44.489> has

00:03:45.020 --> 00:03:45.030 
definitely something you'll want it has

00:03:45.030 --> 00:03:48.199 
definitely something you'll want it has
a<00:03:45.060> in<00:03:45.810> oven<00:03:46.350> as<00:03:46.500> opposed<00:03:47.010> to<00:03:47.220> a<00:03:47.370> convection

00:03:48.199 --> 00:03:48.209 
a in oven as opposed to a convection

00:03:48.209 --> 00:03:50.060 
a in oven as opposed to a convection
microwave<00:03:48.359> it's<00:03:48.870> an<00:03:48.959> option<00:03:49.470> on<00:03:49.590> this<00:03:49.799> one<00:03:49.950> you

00:03:50.060 --> 00:03:50.070 
microwave it's an option on this one you

00:03:50.070 --> 00:03:51.890 
microwave it's an option on this one you
can<00:03:50.160> go<00:03:50.250> either<00:03:50.430> way<00:03:50.579> they<00:03:51.299> chose<00:03:51.540> to<00:03:51.600> go<00:03:51.870> with

00:03:51.890 --> 00:03:51.900 
can go either way they chose to go with

00:03:51.900 --> 00:03:53.750 
can go either way they chose to go with
the<00:03:52.079> oven<00:03:52.500> so<00:03:52.709> it<00:03:52.799> just<00:03:52.980> depends<00:03:53.250> on<00:03:53.430> what<00:03:53.640> you

00:03:53.750 --> 00:03:53.760 
the oven so it just depends on what you

00:03:53.760 --> 00:03:55.699 
the oven so it just depends on what you
would<00:03:53.910> want<00:03:54.090> there<00:03:54.329> it<00:03:55.230> does<00:03:55.440> have<00:03:55.680> a

00:03:55.699 --> 00:03:55.709 
would want there it does have a

00:03:55.709 --> 00:03:58.699 
would want there it does have a
