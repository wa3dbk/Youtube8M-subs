00:00:13.540 --> 00:00:17.830
 for the young number 54 post and well 

00:00:16.390 --> 00:00:19.630

00:00:17.830 --> 00:00:20.860

00:00:19.630 --> 00:00:22.750

00:00:20.860 --> 00:00:25.450
 following the clip and you were still great 

00:00:22.750 --> 00:00:26.619

00:00:25.450 --> 00:00:28.300
 bad of good answers this time 

00:00:26.619 --> 00:00:30.340

00:00:28.300 --> 00:00:31.540
 first and ben anyway you go 

00:00:30.340 --> 00:00:32.800
 still be surprised by the rest of the 

00:00:31.540 --> 00:00:33.610
 clip in my opinion since it changes a 

00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:35.739
 little bit usual 

00:00:33.610 --> 00:00:37.150
 and if not I wanted to tell you that 

00:00:35.739 --> 00:00:38.680

00:00:37.150 --> 00:00:39.940

00:00:38.680 --> 00:00:41.800

00:01:04.930 --> 00:01:07.960
 I totally got this time it's 

00:01:06.190 --> 00:01:09.250
 successful and I have a little bit deceived you 

00:01:07.960 --> 00:01:10.750
 on that one and suddenly I found 

00:01:09.250 --> 00:01:13.780
