00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.890
 and October staff under the steppe today 

00:00:02.790 --> 00:00:06.629
 I'll bring another video for you guys. 

00:00:04.890 --> 00:00:11.070
 Today's video I'm going to talk about here 

00:00:06.629 --> 00:00:14.099
 is the screen has screen 

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:16.320
 l gl 50 camera shock 

00:00:14.099 --> 00:00:18.570
 here we go in the settings the settings 

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:20.670
 depending on how you call and we have 

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:22.769
 here, and let's go to the settings 

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:25.289
 her 

00:00:22.769 --> 00:00:28.289
 we already have the brightness here that is very 

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:33.390
 easy to set night glow and it is 

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:36.960
 bigger than the day understand this part 

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:38.790
 here is good but you can see that this 

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:41.250
 configuration is very easy and the 

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:42.690
 screen is 30 seconds or one minute if 

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:44.820
 you do not move the screen during a 

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:47.160
 minute he erases 30 second will be paid 

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:50.910
 leaves as little as possible tap that consumes 

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:54.030
 less is battery and it is tac keep the screen 

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:55.920
 This is always attached, that's a detail. 

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:58.890
 which I do not think you should do 

00:00:55.920 --> 00:01:00.780
 because you can leave your skin law ten 

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:03.030
 years there and there he will always be there 

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:06.270
 connecting to the battery is over then 

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:08.310
 with limit everything you give that limit there and 

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:09.869
 there you put as low as possible in the 

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:10.500
 case of motor making video boot five 

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:13.110
 minutes 

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:14.640
 he was going but it really stumbles 

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:17.610
 You are currently making a video options 

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:23.299
 comparative effect off until was 

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:27.240
 There's a black hole here, there's a black hole. 

00:01:23.299 --> 00:01:29.130
 that's what I think it's cooler and far 

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:31.200
 provide is also very good 

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:36.960
 so you choose whatever you want I 

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:38.549
 I'll put the rotate until automatic 

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:40.049
 according to the position of the phone calls 

00:01:38.549 --> 00:01:42.180
 various settings for the 

00:01:40.049 --> 00:01:44.430
 settings so very basic this 

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:45.509
 screen rotation that it has here decreases 

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:47.369
 the brightness because it's difficult to 

00:01:45.509 --> 00:01:49.880
 preview you see in the video 

00:01:47.369 --> 00:01:52.799
 I do not know why this happens yet 

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:56.750
 screen saver is quite a deal here 

00:01:52.799 --> 00:01:56.750
 start clock now 

00:01:57.140 --> 00:02:03.950
 of 55 Sunday morning 

00:02:00.470 --> 00:02:06.200
 google photos start now 

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:10.670
 picture selected and select 

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:13.040
 and showcase of android here is very 

00:02:10.670 --> 00:02:14.660
 cool I'll leave the store and I'll go 

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:17.690
 come back 

00:02:14.660 --> 00:02:20.360
 okay and has very large font size 

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:22.520
 and if it really will get complicated leave 

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:25.160
 very big even you boot big guess 

00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:27.380
 which is enough or even medium arrives 

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:29.570
 here average is enough at least 

00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:31.070
 for me kind of source and my grandmother for 

00:02:29.570 --> 00:02:33.620
 An example is going to have to put the gigantÃ£o 

00:02:31.070 --> 00:02:35.060
 this is another source he has 

00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:38.420
 available 

00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:42.140
 This is another source. 

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:43.850
 serif and this one is the one for haiti 

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:45.590
 you choose the font you want 

00:02:43.850 --> 00:02:48.050
 to vote the goal even though it is more 

00:02:45.590 --> 00:02:49.820
 even simpler uniform 

00:02:48.050 --> 00:02:51.680
 then these are the screen settings 

00:02:49.820 --> 00:02:54.170
