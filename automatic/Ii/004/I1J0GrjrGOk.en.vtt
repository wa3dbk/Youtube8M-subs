00:00:03.340 --> 00:00:08.320
 few goals yes and supposedly it was the 

00:00:06.040 --> 00:00:10.090
 more attractive duel of this day 12 

00:00:08.320 --> 00:00:11.440
 we had it here on the screen 

00:00:10.090 --> 00:00:13.750
 Telemundo with the debut of Carlos 

00:00:11.440 --> 00:00:16.150
 hermosillo the champion Leon faced the 

00:00:13.750 --> 00:00:17.560
 leader blue cross two teams that also 

00:00:16.150 --> 00:00:19.300
 they have participation in tournaments 

00:00:17.560 --> 00:00:20.670
 international liberators cup and 

00:00:19.300 --> 00:00:23.050
 concacaf champions leagues 

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:25.210
 players in the Mexican national team there are 

00:00:23.050 --> 00:00:27.580
 eager to try to remain 

00:00:25.210 --> 00:00:30.220
 protagonists at the local level 

00:00:27.580 --> 00:00:32.289
 really a game that was left to be 

00:00:30.220 --> 00:00:34.629
 with very few emotions we are going to 

00:00:32.289 --> 00:00:36.280
 perform with carlos hermosillo few 

00:00:34.629 --> 00:00:38.230
 options in front of the goal I think 

00:00:36.280 --> 00:00:39.940
 the clearest thing that had lion was the 

00:00:38.230 --> 00:00:42.520
 monde as clear as it was blue cross 

00:00:39.940 --> 00:00:44.350
 today red again was Marco Fabian 

00:00:42.520 --> 00:00:47.380
 who tries in front of goal what 

00:00:44.350 --> 00:00:50.110
 saved Navarro fernando practically 

00:00:47.380 --> 00:00:51.940
 drowning the goal cry a new shot 

00:00:50.110 --> 00:00:53.950
 of medium distance from the mountain 

00:00:51.940 --> 00:00:57.280
 we reiterate the clearest thing that the 

00:00:53.950 --> 00:00:59.770
 set of the beast opportunities 

00:00:57.280 --> 00:01:03.070
 wasted by hugo mariano pavone 

00:00:59.770 --> 00:01:04.869
 they were finally expelled rafa 

00:01:03.070 --> 00:01:07.180
 marquez another auction of frames had 

00:01:04.869 --> 00:01:08.920
 few opportunities also on average 

00:01:07.180 --> 00:01:09.460
 distance did not take advantage of the ball 

00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:11.560
 stopped 

00:01:09.460 --> 00:01:13.690
 this good intervention of chin crown 

00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:16.960
 case as clearly as Boselli had 

00:01:13.690 --> 00:01:20.409
 entered the complementary stage 0 to 0 

00:01:16.960 --> 00:01:22.479
 a tie that keeps the leader 

00:01:20.409 --> 00:01:24.009
 'cement machine' but that complicates the 

00:01:22.479 --> 00:01:26.140
 lion in his liguilla aspirations 

00:01:24.009 --> 00:01:28.290
 he almost calls him and the word of the 

00:01:26.140 --> 00:01:28.290
 protagonists 

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:32.670
 chapeau 100 a very close game very 

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:34.799
 disputed 

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:36.750
 we did not know that it was going to be that way 

00:01:34.799 --> 00:01:38.759
 complicated out there we had opportunity 

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:40.049
 of golf gracefully did not fall with 

00:01:38.759 --> 00:01:42.180
 attend this there is a little dot we also 

00:01:40.049 --> 00:01:44.340
 confronts the party on Wednesday that 

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:45.750
 leave this dish as I tell you we know that 

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:48.090
 is going to be like that we are going against super leader 

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:49.770
 it's a team they were very good others 

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:52.049
 also and shares very much the many 

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:54.060
 liberating fatigues the league and always 

00:01:52.049 --> 00:01:55.500
 it's space does not seem to prepare to have 

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:57.450
 physical power to do everything possible 

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:59.820
 to make it better and thank you there we are 

00:01:57.450 --> 00:02:01.350
 a little bit worked the game I do not know if 

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:04.350
 out there at times locked but for 

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:05.330
 moments there were situations in the 

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:07.350
 two areas 

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:09.869
 unfortunately we could not specify 

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:11.549
 but good if it's important you can follow 

00:02:09.869 --> 00:02:12.209
 adding and continuing up there the taste of 

00:02:11.549 --> 00:02:14.340
 mouth that they give you 

00:02:12.209 --> 00:02:16.709
 it is obvious that one wants to win 

00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:18.269
 we wanted to win we wanted to continue for the 

00:02:16.709 --> 00:02:19.739
 positive path but do not forget 

00:02:18.269 --> 00:02:21.569
 that Leon the last champion has good 

00:02:19.739 --> 00:02:22.950
 players we also came from 

00:02:21.569 --> 00:02:24.330
 a wear on the week so believe 

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:27.350
 you have to value the tie 

00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:27.350
 mariano thank you very much for nothing
