screenshots that show basically a

00:00:14.849 --> 00:00:17.750 
screenshots that show basically a
well-rounded<00:00:15.719> idea<00:00:16.350> in<00:00:16.619> every<00:00:17.130> single<00:00:17.340> block

00:00:17.750 --> 00:00:17.760 
well-rounded idea in every single block

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:20.240 
well-rounded idea in every single block
in<00:00:18.000> the<00:00:18.300> new<00:00:18.420> texture<00:00:18.930> pack<00:00:19.109> this<00:00:19.800> is<00:00:20.039> the

00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:20.250 
in the new texture pack this is the

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:22.340 
in the new texture pack this is the
plastic<00:00:20.939> texture<00:00:21.300> pack<00:00:21.480> and<00:00:21.750> it<00:00:21.900> makes<00:00:22.080> things

00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:22.350 
plastic texture pack and it makes things

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:25.490 
plastic texture pack and it makes things
look<00:00:22.650> more<00:00:23.090> cartoonish<00:00:24.090> now<00:00:24.330> I<00:00:24.570> don't<00:00:25.289> have

00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:25.500 
look more cartoonish now I don't have

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:27.830 
look more cartoonish now I don't have
much<00:00:25.740> to<00:00:25.949> say<00:00:26.130> about<00:00:26.250> this<00:00:26.519> guy's<00:00:26.789> it's<00:00:27.599> not

00:00:27.830 --> 00:00:27.840 
much to say about this guy's it's not

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:30.439 
much to say about this guy's it's not
too<00:00:28.650> exciting<00:00:29.310> I<00:00:29.550> think<00:00:30.150> they<00:00:30.269> could<00:00:30.420> have

00:00:30.439 --> 00:00:30.449 
too exciting I think they could have

00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:32.569 
too exciting I think they could have
done<00:00:30.720> better<00:00:30.929> but<00:00:31.529> it<00:00:31.650> still<00:00:31.949> looks<00:00:32.430> pretty

00:00:32.569 --> 00:00:32.579 
done better but it still looks pretty

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:34.490 
done better but it still looks pretty
good<00:00:33.059> it's<00:00:33.239> going<00:00:33.329> to<00:00:33.420> be<00:00:33.510> fun<00:00:33.719> to<00:00:33.750> play<00:00:34.079> on<00:00:34.260> and

00:00:34.490 --> 00:00:34.500 
good it's going to be fun to play on and

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:36.350 
good it's going to be fun to play on and
it's<00:00:34.860> not<00:00:35.100> like<00:00:35.309> the<00:00:35.520> mash-up<00:00:35.910> pack<00:00:36.120> where

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:36.360 
it's not like the mash-up pack where

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:38.660 
it's not like the mash-up pack where
they<00:00:36.480> kind<00:00:36.930> of<00:00:36.989> messed<00:00:37.410> up<00:00:37.649> every<00:00:37.950> block<00:00:38.219> you

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:38.670 
they kind of messed up every block you

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:40.760 
they kind of messed up every block you
can<00:00:38.850> actually<00:00:39.270> tell<00:00:39.690> which<00:00:40.050> blocks<00:00:40.379> are<00:00:40.590> which

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:40.770 
can actually tell which blocks are which

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:42.470 
can actually tell which blocks are which
still<00:00:41.100> because<00:00:41.250> it<00:00:41.370> is<00:00:41.489> just<00:00:41.790> a<00:00:41.850> texture<00:00:42.270> pack

00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:42.480 
still because it is just a texture pack

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:45.950 
still because it is just a texture pack
and<00:00:42.719> so<00:00:42.899> you<00:00:42.960> can<00:00:43.200> go<00:00:43.350> mining<00:00:43.649> fours<00:00:44.219> and<00:00:44.960> know

00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:45.960 
and so you can go mining fours and know

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:48.260 
and so you can go mining fours and know
that<00:00:46.559> the<00:00:46.800> ORS<00:00:46.980> are<00:00:47.309> there<00:00:47.640> and<00:00:47.879> those<00:00:48.059> are<00:00:48.239> the

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:48.270 
that the ORS are there and those are the

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:51.260 
that the ORS are there and those are the
oars<00:00:49.129> they<00:00:50.129> did<00:00:50.399> texture<00:00:50.910> the<00:00:51.030> mobs

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:51.270 
oars they did texture the mobs

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:52.760 
oars they did texture the mobs
differently<00:00:51.899> which<00:00:52.140> they<00:00:52.320> didn't<00:00:52.590> in<00:00:52.680> the

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:52.770 
differently which they didn't in the

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:54.410 
differently which they didn't in the
mash-up<00:00:53.070> pack<00:00:53.250> so<00:00:53.460> I'm<00:00:53.550> glad<00:00:53.730> that<00:00:54.090> the<00:00:54.210> mobs

00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:54.420 
mash-up pack so I'm glad that the mobs

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:57.830 
mash-up pack so I'm glad that the mobs
got<00:00:54.809> retextured<00:00:55.530> this<00:00:56.520> texture<00:00:57.210> pack<00:00:57.420> made<00:00:57.719> it
