00:00:11.020 --> 00:00:15.710
 hello everyone we'll explain a 

00:00:13.760 --> 00:00:18.440
 little bit how can you 

00:00:15.710 --> 00:00:20.990
 make yourself at home to download 

00:00:18.440 --> 00:00:21.200
 podcasts pump study alone with your 

00:00:20.990 --> 00:00:23.360
 hands 

00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:24.680
 and yes completely then the first 

00:00:23.360 --> 00:00:27.560
 thing to do is to download 

00:00:24.680 --> 00:00:28.340
 itunes but that's fine I guess and I know 

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:29.480
 that there are other problems that can 

00:00:28.340 --> 00:00:30.619
 do it but I imagine you know 

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:32.689
 all do it so we'll assume that 

00:00:30.619 --> 00:00:35.570
 you already have itunes and you have it 

00:00:32.689 --> 00:00:37.910
 already launched and is there where is where 

00:00:35.570 --> 00:00:40.550
 lies the podcast did you do 

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:42.680
 so we hooked up our device 

00:00:40.550 --> 00:00:45.080
 is the max von in this case it was 

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:46.700
 connected with a usb cable where is 

00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:50.240
 the podcast well we go in the podcast 

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:52.160
 and we will go through the podcasts of 

00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:54.230
 lightroom store and as things are 

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:56.000
 well done we are here we are in the sixth 

00:00:54.230 --> 00:00:59.180
 position you remember first 

00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:00.650
 line 6th position otherwise there is an engine 

00:00:59.180 --> 00:01:02.750
 of research that we do one so that is 

00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:04.909
 what we do we click we click on it 

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:10.820
 click and we are not wrong we do not click to 

00:01:04.909 --> 00:01:12.590
 side and bim 300 episodes to ales and that 

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:14.780
 so here we told you there 

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:16.970
 had a little not enough to spend from 

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:18.740
 server capabilities result our friends 

00:01:16.970 --> 00:01:19.970
 from leva computer science came to us 

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:21.470
 give a little help and 

00:01:19.970 --> 00:01:22.130
 now you can download all 

00:01:21.470 --> 00:01:23.690
 the episodes 

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:26.900
 even the first ones even the most rotten 

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:27.920
 and you can really it is first 

00:01:26.900 --> 00:01:29.900
 at the same time and that's cool 

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:31.040
 yeah same chips and noah very soon 

00:01:29.900 --> 00:01:33.260
 so 

00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:36.110
 so here we have the podcasts with trip 

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:37.370
 via day a day off between with 

00:01:36.110 --> 00:01:39.020
 publication deadlines on youtube 

00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:40.370
 so what do we do ben we have 

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:42.409
 want this one for example grubby 

00:01:40.370 --> 00:01:43.340
 against demuslim and it does not last a 

00:01:42.409 --> 00:01:47.420
 second to that it's a problem 

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:49.070
 display so thing did we go 

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:50.659
 click in the free because it's 

00:01:49.070 --> 00:01:52.460
 free because it's yes that's it 

00:01:50.659 --> 00:01:54.290
 free you do not have to pay in fact you 

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:57.920
 do not have to shell out 2 monetary amounts 

00:01:54.290 --> 00:01:59.080
 finally no counterpart 

00:01:57.920 --> 00:02:04.500
 financial 

00:01:59.080 --> 00:02:06.540
 it's free and there 

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:08.700
 you click on free you wait 30 

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:09.000
 seconds that's so low question big 

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:10.830
 South 

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:12.030
 does it depend on the music it's 

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:14.190
 that she is first of the connection 

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:15.870
 so here at home here is a 

00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:16.470
 minute but at home maybe it's 

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:18.960
 faster 

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:20.430
 okay so here you are downloading 

00:02:18.960 --> 00:02:20.760

00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:30.810
 beside 

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:33.140
