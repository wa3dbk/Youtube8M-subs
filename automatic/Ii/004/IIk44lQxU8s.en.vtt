know why we say that Lighting's much as

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:20.810 
know why we say that Lighting's much as
possible<00:00:18.930> is<00:00:19.050> good<00:00:19.260> because<00:00:19.470> usually<00:00:19.830> i'm

00:00:20.810 --> 00:00:20.820 
possible is good because usually i'm

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:22.580 
possible is good because usually i'm
going<00:00:21.029> to<00:00:21.090> be<00:00:21.180> the<00:00:21.359> better<00:00:21.480> player<00:00:21.810> but<00:00:22.470> it's

00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:22.590

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:37.260 
not going to be seen so far yeah just

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:42.319 
not going to be seen so far yeah just
changed<00:00:37.710> my<00:00:38.750> camo<00:00:39.750> start<00:00:40.680> this<00:00:40.800> game<00:00:41.210> we<00:00:42.210> got

00:00:42.319 --> 00:00:42.329 
changed my camo start this game we got

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:44.270 
changed my camo start this game we got
some<00:00:42.540> 55<00:00:43.020> s<00:00:43.170> in<00:00:43.260> their<00:00:43.379> team<00:00:43.530> that<00:00:43.649> might<00:00:43.829> be<00:00:44.250> a

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:44.280 
some 55 s in their team that might be a

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:46.220 
some 55 s in their team that might be a
problem<00:00:44.460> but<00:00:45.000> I<00:00:45.180> think<00:00:45.539> if<00:00:45.690> you<00:00:45.780> charge<00:00:46.020> the

00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:46.230 
problem but I think if you charge the

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:48.260 
problem but I think if you charge the
left<00:00:46.440> flank<00:00:46.710> let's<00:00:47.309> see<00:00:47.460> it<00:00:47.610> which<00:00:47.879> usually<00:00:48.030> is

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:48.270 
left flank let's see it which usually is

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:50.000 
left flank let's see it which usually is
a<00:00:48.329> little<00:00:48.510> weak<00:00:48.690> in<00:00:48.809> this<00:00:48.960> map<00:00:49.140> we<00:00:49.649> can<00:00:49.800> get<00:00:49.980> a

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:50.010 
a little weak in this map we can get a

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:54.920 
a little weak in this map we can get a
pretty<00:00:50.309> good<00:00:50.430> tactic<00:00:50.910> advantage<00:00:51.329> so<00:00:52.640> yeah<00:00:53.930> you

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:54.930 
pretty good tactic advantage so yeah you

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:56.360 
pretty good tactic advantage so yeah you
look<00:00:55.050> at<00:00:55.140> my<00:00:55.199> turtle<00:00:55.500> beaches<00:00:55.770> blaring<00:00:56.250> so<00:00:56.340> I

00:00:56.360 --> 00:00:56.370 
look at my turtle beaches blaring so I

00:00:56.370 --> 00:00:57.950 
look at my turtle beaches blaring so I
can<00:00:56.520> hear<00:00:56.610> every<00:00:56.940> single<00:00:57.059> fucking<00:00:57.510> footstep

00:00:57.950 --> 00:00:57.960 
can hear every single fucking footstep

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:05.440 
can hear every single fucking footstep
because<00:00:58.800> you<00:00:58.890> know<00:00:59.039> it's<00:00:59.820> a<00:00:59.940> big<00:01:00.090> advantage

00:01:05.440 --> 00:01:05.450 

00:01:05.450 --> 00:01:08.690 

every<00:01:06.450> other<00:01:06.750> team<00:01:07.140> is<00:01:07.920> very<00:01:08.100> important

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:08.700 
every other team is very important

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:12.980 
every other team is very important
because<00:01:11.180> yeah<00:01:12.180> let's<00:01:12.510> all<00:01:12.570> right<00:01:12.750> they<00:01:12.840> might

00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:12.990 
because yeah let's all right they might

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:24.890 
because yeah let's all right they might
have<00:01:22.400> and<00:01:23.400> I<00:01:23.460> get<00:01:23.580> up<00:01:23.640> the<00:01:23.759> deagle<00:01:24.119> and<00:01:24.659> so<00:01:24.810> as

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:24.900 
have and I get up the deagle and so as

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:25.969 
have and I get up the deagle and so as
you<00:01:24.960> can<00:01:25.049> see<00:01:25.170> is<00:01:25.259> important<00:01:25.619> to<00:01:25.710> shoot<00:01:25.890> as

00:01:25.969 --> 00:01:25.979 
you can see is important to shoot as

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:28.249 
you can see is important to shoot as
much<00:01:26.100> as<00:01:26.250> possible<00:01:26.430> because<00:01:27.080> every<00:01:28.080> bullet

00:01:28.249 --> 00:01:28.259 
much as possible because every bullet

00:01:28.259 --> 00:01:30.649 
much as possible because every bullet
counts<00:01:28.710> and<00:01:28.890> why<00:01:29.670> shoot<00:01:29.909> one<00:01:30.150> bullet<00:01:30.270> for<00:01:30.509> keep

00:01:30.649 --> 00:01:30.659 
counts and why shoot one bullet for keep

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:31.969 
counts and why shoot one bullet for keep
your<00:01:30.780> weight<00:01:30.900> location<00:01:31.320> away<00:01:31.500> when<00:01:31.770> you<00:01:31.860> could

00:01:31.969 --> 00:01:31.979 
your weight location away when you could

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:33.380 
your weight location away when you could
shoot<00:01:32.100> all<00:01:32.220> of<00:01:32.250> them<00:01:32.520> I<00:01:32.700> mean<00:01:32.880> better<00:01:33.150> chance

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:33.390 
shoot all of them I mean better chance

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:36.440 
shoot all of them I mean better chance
of<00:01:33.450> killing<00:01:33.600> them<00:01:33.780> right<00:01:34.790> up<00:01:35.790> my<00:01:36.150> claim<00:01:36.360> were
