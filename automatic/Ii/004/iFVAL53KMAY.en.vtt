the one part of the sleeve and probably

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:40.310 
the one part of the sleeve and probably
to<00:00:37.830> complete<00:00:38.190> the<00:00:38.309> sleeve<00:00:38.610> we<00:00:38.940> need<00:00:39.320> average

00:00:40.310 --> 00:00:40.320 
to complete the sleeve we need average

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:42.350 
to complete the sleeve we need average
about<00:00:40.680> five<00:00:41.070> pictures<00:00:41.489> five<00:00:42.150> different

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:42.360 
about five pictures five different

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:44.810 
about five pictures five different
pictures<00:00:42.930> and<00:00:43.170> then<00:00:43.769> we<00:00:43.949> can<00:00:44.129> build<00:00:44.340> a<00:00:44.580> full

00:00:44.810 --> 00:00:44.820 
pictures and then we can build a full

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:47.330 
pictures and then we can build a full
sleeve<00:00:45.059> composition<00:00:45.720> using<00:00:46.110> them<00:00:46.260> and<00:00:46.470> so

00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:47.340 
sleeve composition using them and so

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:49.970 
sleeve composition using them and so
