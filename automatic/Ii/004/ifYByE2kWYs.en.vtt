00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:52.170 
that's why it's so important to do some

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:53.540 
that's why it's so important to do some
resistance<00:00:52.589> training<00:00:52.710> strength<00:00:53.460> training

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:53.550 
resistance training strength training

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:55.669 
resistance training strength training
and<00:00:54.149> you<00:00:54.690> know<00:00:54.780> get<00:00:54.989> that<00:00:55.170> in<00:00:55.320> and<00:00:55.469> make<00:00:55.559> sure

00:01:00.529 --> 00:01:00.539 
anyway let's get to my macros now which

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:04.009 
anyway let's get to my macros now which
I'm<00:01:00.690> pretty<00:01:00.870> excited<00:01:01.019> for<00:01:01.469> so<00:01:02.429> I<00:01:03.019> calculated

00:01:04.009 --> 00:01:04.019 
I'm pretty excited for so I calculated

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:06.679 
I'm pretty excited for so I calculated
them<00:01:04.140> using<00:01:04.589> one<00:01:05.399> of<00:01:05.430> the<00:01:05.909> formulas<00:01:06.390> I<00:01:06.479> found

00:01:06.679 --> 00:01:06.689 
them using one of the formulas I found

00:01:06.689 --> 00:01:08.749 
them using one of the formulas I found
online<00:01:06.950> and<00:01:07.950> I<00:01:08.040> will<00:01:08.220> show<00:01:08.340> you<00:01:08.399> guys<00:01:08.490> that

00:01:08.749 --> 00:01:08.759 
online and I will show you guys that

00:01:08.759 --> 00:01:10.550 
online and I will show you guys that
formula<00:01:09.149> to<00:01:09.299> compare<00:01:09.659> a<00:01:09.810> lot<00:01:10.020> of<00:01:10.259> the

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:10.560 
formula to compare a lot of the

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:12.499 
formula to compare a lot of the
preeminent<00:01:11.490> formulas<00:01:11.970> that<00:01:12.000> I<00:01:12.149> found<00:01:12.360> online

00:01:12.499 --> 00:01:12.509 
preeminent formulas that I found online

00:01:12.509 --> 00:01:14.899 
preeminent formulas that I found online
and<00:01:13.020> this<00:01:13.110> one<00:01:13.259> was<00:01:13.350> pretty<00:01:13.530> solid<00:01:14.009> but<00:01:14.280> as

00:01:14.899 --> 00:01:14.909 
and this one was pretty solid but as

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:16.399 
and this one was pretty solid but as
always<00:01:15.149> you<00:01:15.450> start<00:01:15.689> to<00:01:15.810> experiment<00:01:16.290> with<00:01:16.380> your

00:01:16.399 --> 00:01:16.409 
always you start to experiment with your

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:18.050 
always you start to experiment with your
own<00:01:16.530> body<00:01:16.799> and<00:01:16.950> see<00:01:17.369> so<00:01:17.640> ie

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:18.060 
own body and see so ie

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:19.160 
own body and see so ie
I'm<00:01:18.240> going<00:01:18.450> to<00:01:18.540> be<00:01:18.659> checking<00:01:18.810> in<00:01:18.990> with<00:01:19.049> you

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:19.170

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:22.890 
you guys my physique and so you can see

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:25.249 
you guys my physique and so you can see
the<00:01:23.009> changes<00:01:23.399> in<00:01:23.579> the<00:01:23.729> gains<00:01:24.420> that<00:01:24.960> I've<00:01:25.140> been

00:01:25.249 --> 00:01:25.259 
the changes in the gains that I've been

00:01:25.259 --> 00:01:28.580 
the changes in the gains that I've been
making<00:01:25.469> so<00:01:26.479> that's<00:01:27.479> how<00:01:27.750> I'll<00:01:28.020> really<00:01:28.229> tell<00:01:28.500> if

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:28.590 
making so that's how I'll really tell if

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:29.899 
making so that's how I'll really tell if
this<00:01:28.680> formula<00:01:28.920> is<00:01:29.310> on<00:01:29.490> point

00:01:29.899 --> 00:01:29.909 
this formula is on point

00:01:29.909 --> 00:01:34.760 
this formula is on point

for a while after my competition I was

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:47.810 
for a while after my competition I was
actually<00:01:45.960> kind<00:01:46.140> of<00:01:46.170> scared<00:01:46.530> to<00:01:46.680> really<00:01:47.549> eat

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:47.820 
actually kind of scared to really eat

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:50.510 
actually kind of scared to really eat
carbs<00:01:48.270> and<00:01:48.450> really<00:01:48.689> go<00:01:48.840> in<00:01:49.079> and<00:01:49.380> I<00:01:49.409> should<00:01:50.399> have

00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:50.520 
carbs and really go in and I should have

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:52.429 
carbs and really go in and I should have
been<00:01:50.640> because<00:01:50.789> I<00:01:50.939> was<00:01:51.060> super<00:01:51.329> low<00:01:51.450> carb<00:01:51.689> for

love if I gain 1 or 2 pounds a month I
know<00:02:41.130> that<00:02:41.489> this<00:02:41.580> is<00:02:41.760> a<00:02:41.790> little<00:02:41.880> bit<00:02:42.180> too<00:02:42.330> much

00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:42.450 
know that this is a little bit too much

00:02:42.450 --> 00:02:44.210 
know that this is a little bit too much
for<00:02:42.690> me<00:02:42.780> I<00:02:42.810> need<00:02:42.959> to<00:02:43.019> scale<00:02:43.200> it<00:02:43.260> back<00:02:43.500> I<00:02:43.800> need<00:02:44.130> to

00:02:44.210 --> 00:02:44.220 
for me I need to scale it back I need to

00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:46.280 
for me I need to scale it back I need to
UM<00:02:44.370> even<00:02:45.030> go<00:02:45.120> harder<00:02:45.510> in<00:02:45.600> the<00:02:45.660> gym<00:02:45.690> but<00:02:46.050> I<00:02:46.080> have

00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:46.290 
UM even go harder in the gym but I have

00:02:46.290 --> 00:02:47.660 
UM even go harder in the gym but I have
been<00:02:46.470> going<00:02:46.590> hard<00:02:46.860> and<00:02:46.950> looking<00:02:47.250> heavy<00:02:47.430> and

00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:47.670 
been going hard and looking heavy and

00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:49.550 
been going hard and looking heavy and
you<00:02:47.790> got<00:02:47.940> to<00:02:48.060> see<00:02:48.150> that<00:02:48.180> in<00:02:48.330> some<00:02:48.540> videos<00:02:48.810> too

00:02:49.550 --> 00:02:49.560 
you got to see that in some videos too

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:52.340 
you got to see that in some videos too
so<00:02:49.800> stay<00:02:49.860> tuned<00:02:50.220> that<00:02:50.580> the<00:02:51.540> formula<00:02:52.080> is

00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:52.350 
so stay tuned that the formula is

00:02:52.350 --> 00:02:55.009 
so stay tuned that the formula is
basically<00:02:52.950> you<00:02:53.220> take<00:02:53.430> your<00:02:53.700> bodyweight<00:02:54.450> you

00:02:55.009 --> 00:02:55.019 
basically you take your bodyweight you

00:02:55.019 --> 00:02:56.960 
basically you take your bodyweight you
multiply<00:02:55.470> it<00:02:55.500> by<00:02:55.739> either<00:02:55.980> if<00:02:56.340> you're<00:02:56.700> a<00:02:56.760> woman

00:02:56.960 --> 00:02:56.970 
multiply it by either if you're a woman

00:02:56.970 --> 00:03:01.220 
multiply it by either if you're a woman
you<00:02:57.330> multiply<00:02:57.810> about<00:02:58.110> either<00:02:58.350> 16<00:02:59.190> 18<00:03:00.060> or<00:03:00.330> 20<00:03:01.019> if

00:03:01.220 --> 00:03:01.230 
you multiply about either 16 18 or 20 if

00:03:01.230 --> 00:03:02.750 
you multiply about either 16 18 or 20 if
you<00:03:01.530> if<00:03:01.860> you're<00:03:01.980> a<00:03:02.010> male<00:03:02.340> you're<00:03:02.550> going<00:03:02.700> to

00:03:02.750 --> 00:03:02.760 
you if you're a male you're going to

00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:06.229 
you if you're a male you're going to
multiply<00:03:03.060> by<00:03:03.269> 18<00:03:03.840> 20<00:03:04.410> or<00:03:04.590> 22<00:03:04.890> and<00:03:05.220> the<00:03:05.880> numbers

00:03:06.229 --> 00:03:06.239 
multiply by 18 20 or 22 and the numbers

00:03:06.239 --> 00:03:08.780 
multiply by 18 20 or 22 and the numbers
that<00:03:06.930> you're<00:03:07.230> multiplying<00:03:07.380> by<00:03:07.739> was<00:03:08.250> based<00:03:08.550> on

00:03:08.780 --> 00:03:08.790 
that you're multiplying by was based on

00:03:08.790 --> 00:03:10.430 
that you're multiplying by was based on
what<00:03:09.090> you're<00:03:09.239> doing<00:03:09.269> on<00:03:09.630> an<00:03:09.750> everyday<00:03:09.959> basis

00:03:10.430 --> 00:03:10.440 
what you're doing on an everyday basis

00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:12.199 
what you're doing on an everyday basis
like<00:03:10.650> how<00:03:11.130> many<00:03:11.310> times<00:03:11.519> a<00:03:11.610> week<00:03:11.640> you<00:03:11.880> work<00:03:12.030> out

00:03:12.199 --> 00:03:12.209 
like how many times a week you work out

00:03:12.209 --> 00:03:15.080 
like how many times a week you work out
and<00:03:12.590> what<00:03:13.590> your<00:03:13.709> job<00:03:13.890> is<00:03:14.070> like<00:03:14.100> I<00:03:14.430> still<00:03:14.910> work

00:03:15.080 --> 00:03:15.090 
and what your job is like I still work

00:03:15.090 --> 00:03:17.750 
and what your job is like I still work
for<00:03:15.180> 95<00:03:15.600> so<00:03:16.140> I'm<00:03:16.530> sitting<00:03:16.950> behind<00:03:17.070> a<00:03:17.220> desk<00:03:17.250> all

00:03:17.750 --> 00:03:17.760 
for 95 so I'm sitting behind a desk all

00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:19.970 
for 95 so I'm sitting behind a desk all
day<00:03:17.820> long<00:03:18.299> so<00:03:18.510> I<00:03:18.540> have<00:03:18.780> it<00:03:18.900> relatively<00:03:19.380> know

00:03:19.970 --> 00:03:19.980 
day long so I have it relatively know

00:03:19.980 --> 00:03:22.310 
day long so I have it relatively know
that<00:03:20.549> mentally<00:03:20.970> I<00:03:21.000> have<00:03:21.180> a<00:03:21.209> sedentary<00:03:21.540> job<00:03:21.840> and

00:03:22.310 --> 00:03:22.320 
that mentally I have a sedentary job and

00:03:22.320 --> 00:03:24.830 
that mentally I have a sedentary job and
I<00:03:22.709> work<00:03:23.040> out<00:03:23.220> at<00:03:23.579> least<00:03:23.610> three<00:03:24.150> times<00:03:24.630> a<00:03:24.810> week

00:03:24.830 --> 00:03:24.840 
I work out at least three times a week

00:03:24.840 --> 00:03:27.470 
I work out at least three times a week
lifting<00:03:25.290> heavy<00:03:25.470> so<00:03:25.799> that's<00:03:26.340> why<00:03:26.880> multiplied

00:03:27.470 --> 00:03:27.480 
lifting heavy so that's why multiplied

00:03:27.480 --> 00:03:29.240 
lifting heavy so that's why multiplied
two<00:03:27.600> by<00:03:27.690> the<00:03:27.750> lowest<00:03:28.230> number<00:03:28.530> which<00:03:28.650> was<00:03:28.799> 16

00:03:29.240 --> 00:03:29.250 
two by the lowest number which was 16

00:03:29.250 --> 00:03:30.800 
two by the lowest number which was 16
because<00:03:29.430> I<00:03:29.610> don't<00:03:29.790> need<00:03:30.000> all<00:03:30.360> those<00:03:30.540> calories

00:03:30.800 --> 00:03:30.810 
because I don't need all those calories

00:03:30.810 --> 00:03:32.810 
because I don't need all those calories
if<00:03:31.260> I'm<00:03:31.680> not<00:03:31.860> going<00:03:32.040> to<00:03:32.100> be<00:03:32.160> burning<00:03:32.340> them<00:03:32.549> up<00:03:32.670> I

00:03:32.810 --> 00:03:32.820 
if I'm not going to be burning them up I

00:03:32.820 --> 00:03:33.979 
if I'm not going to be burning them up I
don't<00:03:32.970> want<00:03:33.090> to<00:03:33.180> gain<00:03:33.269> that<00:03:33.420> much<00:03:33.600> fat<00:03:33.750> like<00:03:33.870> I

00:03:33.979 --> 00:03:33.989 
don't want to gain that much fat like I

00:03:33.989 --> 00:03:38.120 
don't want to gain that much fat like I
said<00:03:34.200> so<00:03:34.860> that<00:03:35.220> came<00:03:35.400> out<00:03:35.549> 220<00:03:36.260> 192<00:03:37.260> and<00:03:37.470> then<00:03:38.100> I

00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:38.130 
said so that came out 220 192 and then I

00:03:38.130 --> 00:03:40.910 
said so that came out 220 192 and then I
took<00:03:38.310> point<00:03:39.299> 9<00:03:39.510> grams<00:03:39.840> of<00:03:39.989> protein<00:03:40.410> you<00:03:40.890> can

00:03:40.910 --> 00:03:40.920 
took point 9 grams of protein you can

00:03:40.920 --> 00:03:42.500 
took point 9 grams of protein you can
either<00:03:41.220> do<00:03:41.459> I<00:03:41.760> think<00:03:41.970> it<00:03:42.030> was<00:03:42.120> like<00:03:42.239> point

00:03:42.500 --> 00:03:42.510 
either do I think it was like point

00:03:42.510 --> 00:03:45.349 
either do I think it was like point
stepping<00:03:42.900> between<00:03:43.380> 1<00:03:43.709> 7<00:03:44.130> and<00:03:44.160> 1<00:03:44.970> gram<00:03:45.299> per

00:03:45.349 --> 00:03:45.359 
stepping between 1 7 and 1 gram per

00:03:45.359 --> 00:03:47.240 
stepping between 1 7 and 1 gram per
pound<00:03:45.720> of<00:03:45.810> protein<00:03:46.170> because<00:03:46.530> it's<00:03:46.739> really<00:03:46.950> not

00:03:47.240 --> 00:03:47.250 
pound of protein because it's really not

00:03:47.250 --> 00:03:49.550 
pound of protein because it's really not
proven<00:03:47.760> that<00:03:47.940> anything<00:03:48.750> was<00:03:48.870> in<00:03:49.019> a<00:03:49.079> gram<00:03:49.290> per

00:03:49.550 --> 00:03:49.560 
proven that anything was in a gram per

00:03:49.560 --> 00:03:53.420 
proven that anything was in a gram per
pound<00:03:49.880> um<00:03:51.109> does<00:03:52.109> much<00:03:52.320> for<00:03:52.560> you<00:03:52.620> yeah<00:03:53.160> I<00:03:53.190> did

00:03:53.420 --> 00:03:53.430 
pound um does much for you yeah I did

00:03:53.430 --> 00:03:57.590 
pound um does much for you yeah I did
137<00:03:54.150> times<00:03:54.359> point<00:03:54.810> 5<00:03:55.049> for<00:03:55.859> my<00:03:56.010> fats<00:03:56.400> and<00:03:56.820> that

00:03:57.590 --> 00:03:57.600 
137 times point 5 for my fats and that

00:03:57.600 --> 00:03:59.479 
137 times point 5 for my fats and that
number<00:03:57.959> is<00:03:57.989> kind<00:03:58.320> of<00:03:58.410> high<00:03:58.530> for<00:03:58.590> a<00:03:58.829> fat<00:03:58.980> its

00:03:59.479 --> 00:03:59.489 
number is kind of high for a fat its

00:03:59.489 --> 00:04:02.500 
number is kind of high for a fat its
told<00:03:59.790> the<00:04:00.030> formula<00:04:00.450> said<00:04:00.690> to<00:04:01.049> multiply<00:04:01.650> your

00:04:02.500 --> 00:04:02.510 
told the formula said to multiply your

00:04:02.510 --> 00:04:05.360 
told the formula said to multiply your
your<00:04:03.510> fat<00:04:03.690> calculation<00:04:04.200> by<00:04:04.350> either<00:04:04.590> point<00:04:04.980> 3

00:04:05.360 --> 00:04:05.370 
your fat calculation by either point 3

00:04:05.370 --> 00:04:09.020 
your fat calculation by either point 3
between<00:04:05.730> point<00:04:06.120> three<00:04:06.180> and<00:04:06.510> point<00:04:07.910> what<00:04:08.910> was

00:04:09.020 --> 00:04:09.030 
between point three and point what was

00:04:09.030 --> 00:04:13.069 
between point three and point what was
it<00:04:09.239> on<00:04:09.799> 0.6<00:04:10.799> 0.5<00:04:11.489> because<00:04:11.820> I<00:04:11.850> do<00:04:11.970> love<00:04:12.359> my<00:04:12.630> fat<00:04:12.900> I

butters okay and I love butter on top of

00:04:23.100 --> 00:04:24.710 
butters okay and I love butter on top of
that<00:04:23.220> grass-fed<00:04:23.940> but<00:04:24.150> that's<00:04:24.449> what<00:04:24.570> you're

00:04:24.710 --> 00:04:24.720 
that grass-fed but that's what you're

00:04:24.720 --> 00:04:26.990 
that grass-fed but that's what you're
going<00:04:24.840> to<00:04:24.870> do<00:04:25.110> is<00:04:25.290> take<00:04:25.620> the<00:04:25.770> number<00:04:25.800> of<00:04:26.639> grams

00:04:26.990 --> 00:04:27.000 
going to do is take the number of grams

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:28.100 
going to do is take the number of grams
that<00:04:27.360> you<00:04:27.479> got<00:04:27.660> for<00:04:27.810> your<00:04:27.930> protein

00:04:28.100 --> 00:04:28.110 
that you got for your protein

00:04:28.110 --> 00:04:30.560 
that you got for your protein
calculation<00:04:29.010> multiply<00:04:29.400> that<00:04:29.550> by<00:04:29.610> four<00:04:30.090> you

00:04:30.560 --> 00:04:30.570 
calculation multiply that by four you

00:04:30.570 --> 00:04:32.000 
calculation multiply that by four you
multiply<00:04:30.960> the<00:04:31.020> number<00:04:31.290> by<00:04:31.320> four<00:04:31.680> because

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:32.010 
multiply the number by four because

00:04:32.010 --> 00:04:33.760 
multiply the number by four because
there<00:04:32.130> are<00:04:32.220> four<00:04:32.280> calories<00:04:32.699> per<00:04:32.940> gram<00:04:33.180> of

00:04:33.760 --> 00:04:33.770 
there are four calories per gram of

00:04:33.770 --> 00:04:37.490 
there are four calories per gram of
protein<00:04:34.770> in<00:04:35.780> there<00:04:36.780> for<00:04:36.960> college<00:04:37.260> program

00:04:37.490 --> 00:04:37.500 
protein in there for college program

00:04:37.500 --> 00:04:39.439 
protein in there for college program
protein<00:04:37.860> so<00:04:38.550> then<00:04:38.729> what<00:04:39.030> you're<00:04:39.120> going<00:04:39.210> to<00:04:39.270> do

00:04:39.439 --> 00:04:39.449 
protein so then what you're going to do

00:04:39.449 --> 00:04:40.850 
protein so then what you're going to do
for<00:04:39.750> the<00:04:39.810> fats<00:04:39.990> is<00:04:40.260> you're<00:04:40.410> going<00:04:40.500> to<00:04:40.560> take<00:04:40.710> the

00:04:40.850 --> 00:04:40.860 
for the fats is you're going to take the

00:04:40.860 --> 00:04:42.500 
for the fats is you're going to take the
number<00:04:41.040> that<00:04:41.130> you<00:04:41.280> got<00:04:41.430> for<00:04:41.580> fat<00:04:41.760> so<00:04:42.090> mine<00:04:42.330> was

00:04:42.500 --> 00:04:42.510 
number that you got for fat so mine was

00:04:42.510 --> 00:04:43.460 
number that you got for fat so mine was
68<00:04:42.900> grams

00:04:43.460 --> 00:04:43.470 
68 grams

00:04:43.470 --> 00:04:45.439 
68 grams
multiply<00:04:44.010> that<00:04:44.220> by<00:04:44.280> nine<00:04:44.790> because<00:04:45.120> there<00:04:45.360> are

00:04:45.439 --> 00:04:45.449 
multiply that by nine because there are

00:04:45.449 --> 00:04:47.659 
multiply that by nine because there are
nine<00:04:45.660> calories<00:04:45.990> per<00:04:46.260> gram<00:04:46.440> of<00:04:46.889> fat<00:04:47.370> so<00:04:47.639> that

00:04:47.659 --> 00:04:47.669 
nine calories per gram of fat so that

00:04:47.669 --> 00:04:51.490 
nine calories per gram of fat so that
means<00:04:48.120> that<00:04:48.419> fat<00:04:48.990> is<00:04:49.350> the<00:04:49.650> most<00:04:49.949> um

00:04:51.490 --> 00:04:51.500 
means that fat is the most um

00:04:51.500 --> 00:04:54.260 
means that fat is the most um
calorically<00:04:52.500> dense<00:04:52.820> macronutrient<00:04:53.820> keep

00:04:54.260 --> 00:04:54.270 
calorically dense macronutrient keep

00:04:54.270 --> 00:04:55.610 
calorically dense macronutrient keep
that<00:04:54.419> in<00:04:54.510> mind<00:04:54.690> come<00:04:55.080> up<00:04:55.200> with<00:04:55.320> those<00:04:55.440> numbers

00:04:55.610 --> 00:04:55.620 
that in mind come up with those numbers

00:04:55.620 --> 00:04:56.690 
that in mind come up with those numbers
you<00:04:55.830> get<00:04:56.160> them

00:04:56.690 --> 00:04:56.700 
you get them

00:04:56.700 --> 00:04:58.460 
you get them
those<00:04:56.940> are<00:04:57.090> your<00:04:57.210> calories<00:04:57.690> those<00:04:58.080> are<00:04:58.260> the

00:04:58.460 --> 00:04:58.470 
those are your calories those are the

00:04:58.470 --> 00:05:00.560 
those are your calories those are the
amount<00:04:58.710> of<00:04:58.770> calories<00:04:58.979> in<00:04:59.490> your<00:04:59.550> diet<00:04:59.820> that<00:05:00.270> are

00:05:00.560 --> 00:05:00.570 
amount of calories in your diet that are

00:05:00.570 --> 00:05:02.930 
amount of calories in your diet that are
going<00:05:01.050> to<00:05:01.139> be<00:05:01.260> from<00:05:01.530> the<00:05:01.710> protein<00:05:02.040> and<00:05:02.220> fats<00:05:02.400> so

00:05:02.930 --> 00:05:02.940 
going to be from the protein and fats so

00:05:02.940 --> 00:05:04.219 
going to be from the protein and fats so
you're<00:05:03.060> going<00:05:03.180> to<00:05:03.240> take<00:05:03.419> those<00:05:03.600> numbers<00:05:04.020> add

00:05:04.219 --> 00:05:04.229 
you're going to take those numbers add

00:05:04.229 --> 00:05:06.050 
you're going to take those numbers add
them<00:05:04.560> together<00:05:04.740> because<00:05:05.220> you<00:05:05.729> know<00:05:05.790> you're

00:05:06.050 --> 00:05:06.060 
them together because you know you're

00:05:06.060 --> 00:05:07.670 
them together because you know you're
converted<00:05:06.389> into<00:05:06.510> calories<00:05:06.960> I<00:05:07.080> got<00:05:07.320> a<00:05:07.350> mountain

00:05:07.670 --> 00:05:07.680 
converted into calories I got a mountain

00:05:07.680 --> 00:05:09.650 
converted into calories I got a mountain
number<00:05:08.010> of<00:05:08.070> thousands<00:05:08.550> so<00:05:08.940> I<00:05:08.970> subtracted<00:05:09.510> that

00:05:09.650 --> 00:05:09.660 
number of thousands so I subtracted that

00:05:09.660 --> 00:05:12.469 
number of thousands so I subtracted that
from<00:05:09.720> the<00:05:10.050> total<00:05:10.289> number<00:05:10.800> of<00:05:10.830> calories<00:05:11.130> that<00:05:11.940> I

00:05:12.469 --> 00:05:12.479 
from the total number of calories that I

00:05:12.479 --> 00:05:14.810 
from the total number of calories that I
will<00:05:12.900> be<00:05:13.020> eating<00:05:13.440> and<00:05:13.710> those<00:05:14.250> the<00:05:14.550> amount<00:05:14.760> of

00:05:14.810 --> 00:05:14.820 
will be eating and those the amount of

00:05:14.820 --> 00:05:17.150 
will be eating and those the amount of
calories<00:05:15.060> that<00:05:15.750> I<00:05:15.810> got<00:05:16.110> four<00:05:16.560> cards<00:05:16.919> so

00:05:17.150 --> 00:05:17.160 
calories that I got four cards so

00:05:17.160 --> 00:05:19.430 
calories that I got four cards so
actually<00:05:17.850> the<00:05:18.360> amount<00:05:18.539> of<00:05:18.660> the<00:05:19.199> amount<00:05:19.380> of

00:05:19.430 --> 00:05:19.440 
actually the amount of the amount of

00:05:19.440 --> 00:05:20.900 
actually the amount of the amount of
calories<00:05:19.919> that<00:05:20.190> I'll<00:05:20.400> be<00:05:20.490> eating<00:05:20.729> each<00:05:20.850> day

00:05:20.900 --> 00:05:20.910 
calories that I'll be eating each day

00:05:20.910 --> 00:05:25.400 
calories that I'll be eating each day
from<00:05:21.510> carbs<00:05:21.930> is<00:05:22.490> 1080<00:05:23.490> four<00:05:23.880> so<00:05:24.419> now<00:05:24.450> you're

00:05:25.400 --> 00:05:25.410 
from carbs is 1080 four so now you're

00:05:25.410 --> 00:05:27.140 
from carbs is 1080 four so now you're
going<00:05:25.530> to<00:05:25.590> convert<00:05:25.889> that<00:05:26.130> number<00:05:26.370> back<00:05:27.120> to

00:05:27.140 --> 00:05:27.150 
going to convert that number back to

00:05:27.150 --> 00:05:28.969 
going to convert that number back to
grams<00:05:27.630> so<00:05:27.870> you<00:05:27.990> know<00:05:28.080> how<00:05:28.200> many<00:05:28.350> grams<00:05:28.620> of

00:05:28.969 --> 00:05:28.979 
grams so you know how many grams of

00:05:28.979 --> 00:05:30.800 
grams so you know how many grams of
carbs<00:05:29.580> you're<00:05:29.700> going<00:05:29.820> to<00:05:29.880> be<00:05:29.970> eating<00:05:30.270> and<00:05:30.510> I

00:05:30.800 --> 00:05:30.810 
carbs you're going to be eating and I

00:05:30.810 --> 00:05:34.460 
carbs you're going to be eating and I
took<00:05:30.870> that<00:05:31.410> number<00:05:31.710> and<00:05:32.100> I'm<00:05:32.990> the<00:05:33.990> tenth<00:05:34.260> out

00:05:34.460 --> 00:05:34.470 
took that number and I'm the tenth out

00:05:34.470 --> 00:05:38.779 
took that number and I'm the tenth out
the<00:05:35.389> 1084<00:05:36.650> calories<00:05:37.650> from<00:05:37.860> carbs<00:05:38.310> and<00:05:38.430> divide

00:05:38.779 --> 00:05:38.789 
the 1084 calories from carbs and divide

00:05:38.789 --> 00:05:41.060 
the 1084 calories from carbs and divide
that<00:05:38.940> by<00:05:39.120> four<00:05:39.539> because<00:05:40.020> they're<00:05:40.289> also<00:05:40.530> four

00:05:41.060 --> 00:05:41.070 
that by four because they're also four

00:05:41.070 --> 00:05:45.200 
that by four because they're also four
calories<00:05:41.370> per<00:05:41.849> gram<00:05:41.880> of<00:05:42.419> carbs<00:05:43.289> so<00:05:43.710> I<00:05:43.979> got<00:05:44.310> 271

00:05:45.200 --> 00:05:45.210 
calories per gram of carbs so I got 271

00:05:45.210 --> 00:05:47.450 
calories per gram of carbs so I got 271
and<00:05:45.450> that's<00:05:45.720> how<00:05:45.870> I<00:05:45.900> got<00:05:46.139> it<00:05:46.320> I<00:05:46.440> put<00:05:46.710> it<00:05:46.740> up<00:05:46.919> so<00:05:47.190> I

00:05:47.450 --> 00:05:47.460 
and that's how I got it I put it up so I

00:05:47.460 --> 00:05:48.740 
and that's how I got it I put it up so I
guess<00:05:47.880> I<00:05:48.000> could<00:05:48.150> make<00:05:48.270> another<00:05:48.419> video

00:05:48.740 --> 00:05:48.750 
guess I could make another video

00:05:48.750 --> 00:05:50.690 
guess I could make another video
explaining<00:05:48.900> how<00:05:49.229> to<00:05:49.349> do<00:05:49.650> this<00:05:49.770> better<00:05:49.979> but<00:05:50.400> I
