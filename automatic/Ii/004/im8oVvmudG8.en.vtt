adds<00:02:27.610> a<00:02:27.760> little<00:02:27.850> more<00:02:28.590> complexity<00:02:29.590> than<00:02:30.070> is

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:30.190 
adds a little more complexity than is

00:02:30.190 --> 00:02:33.600 
adds a little more complexity than is
necessary<00:02:30.370> for<00:02:31.270> me<00:02:31.420> it's<00:02:32.380> hard<00:02:32.590> to<00:02:32.650> get<00:02:32.890> him
