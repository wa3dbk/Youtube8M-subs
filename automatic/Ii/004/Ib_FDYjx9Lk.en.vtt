have here is a larger sized version of
the<00:00:15.929> s6<00:00:16.410> edge<00:00:16.619> though<00:00:17.010> that<00:00:17.580> we<00:00:17.760> already<00:00:18.000> have

so<00:00:19.320> you've<00:00:19.470> been<00:00:19.590> waiting<00:00:19.770> for<00:00:19.980> a<00:00:20.250> larger

00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:20.970 
so you've been waiting for a larger

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:23.050 
so you've been waiting for a larger
sized<00:00:21.180> version<00:00:21.510> of<00:00:21.600> that<00:00:21.689> handset<00:00:22.140> here<00:00:22.740> it<00:00:22.859> is

00:00:23.050 --> 00:00:23.060 
sized version of that handset here it is

00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:25.460 
sized version of that handset here it is
utilizes<00:00:24.060> the<00:00:24.150> same<00:00:24.359> design<00:00:24.930> language<00:00:25.320> as

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:25.470 
utilizes the same design language as

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:27.740 
utilizes the same design language as
before<00:00:25.949> so<00:00:26.340> that<00:00:26.490> means<00:00:26.730> it's<00:00:27.119> metal<00:00:27.539> meets

00:00:27.740 --> 00:00:27.750 
before so that means it's metal meets

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:29.929 
before so that means it's metal meets
glass<00:00:28.080> it's<00:00:28.740> a<00:00:28.890> premium<00:00:29.250> looking<00:00:29.730> thing

solidly construction constructed we have

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:33.920 
solidly construction constructed we have
no<00:00:32.759> complaints<00:00:33.210> about<00:00:33.300> its<00:00:33.750> design

no complaints about its design

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:36.110 
no complaints about its design
whatsoever<00:00:34.380> besides<00:00:35.190> the<00:00:35.309> fact<00:00:35.460> that<00:00:35.610> it<00:00:35.760> is<00:00:35.910> a

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:36.120 
whatsoever besides the fact that it is a

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:38.240 
whatsoever besides the fact that it is a
handful<00:00:36.540> to<00:00:36.630> operate<00:00:37.050> so<00:00:37.350> two<00:00:37.410> hands<00:00:38.100> are

00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:38.250 
handful to operate so two hands are

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:40.280 
handful to operate so two hands are
better<00:00:38.460> than<00:00:38.579> one<00:00:39.000> with<00:00:39.210> this<00:00:39.329> one<00:00:39.390> but<00:00:40.079> that's

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:40.290 
better than one with this one but that's

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:42.260 
better than one with this one but that's
expected<00:00:40.710> when<00:00:41.040> you<00:00:41.129> have<00:00:41.280> a<00:00:41.520> phone<00:00:42.090> with<00:00:42.239> a

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:42.270 
expected when you have a phone with a

have the fingerprint sensor heart rate

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:50.810 
have the fingerprint sensor heart rate
sensor<00:00:48.780> the<00:00:49.320> whole<00:00:49.530> nine<00:00:49.800> yards<00:00:50.190> you<00:00:50.370> have<00:00:50.610> it

sensor the whole nine yards you have it
in<00:00:50.969> toe<00:00:51.239> with<00:00:51.539> it<00:00:51.780> that<00:00:52.530> also<00:00:52.680> includes<00:00:53.100> the

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:53.670 
in toe with it that also includes the

in toe with it that also includes the
dual<00:00:54.059> curve<00:00:54.300> display<00:00:54.719> there's<00:00:55.140> subtle<00:00:55.530> and

00:00:55.910 --> 00:00:55.920 
dual curve display there's subtle and

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:56.930 
dual curve display there's subtle and
they're<00:00:56.280> just<00:00:56.430> not<00:00:56.489> there<00:00:56.640> for<00:00:56.699> the

00:00:56.930 --> 00:00:56.940 
they're just not there for the

00:00:56.940 --> 00:00:59.119 
they're just not there for the
aesthetics<00:00:57.329> they<00:00:57.510> do<00:00:57.570> serve<00:00:57.899> a<00:00:57.930> purpose<00:00:58.260> they

00:00:59.119 --> 00:00:59.129 
aesthetics they do serve a purpose they

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:01.369 
aesthetics they do serve a purpose they
have<00:00:59.370> basically<00:01:00.030> the<00:01:00.420> same<00:01:00.449> core<00:01:00.960> features

00:01:01.369 --> 00:01:01.379 
have basically the same core features

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:03.110 
have basically the same core features
from<00:01:01.590> before<00:01:01.980> so<00:01:02.010> you<00:01:02.250> have<00:01:02.460> things<00:01:02.640> like<00:01:02.820> the

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:03.120 
from before so you have things like the

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:05.270 
from before so you have things like the
ticker<00:01:03.480> system<00:01:03.960> went<00:01:04.439> off<00:01:04.739> you<00:01:04.920> could<00:01:05.040> swipe

00:01:05.270 --> 00:01:05.280 
ticker system went off you could swipe

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:06.830 
ticker system went off you could swipe
your<00:01:05.430> finger<00:01:05.700> and<00:01:06.119> you<00:01:06.330> could<00:01:06.479> actually

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:06.840 
your finger and you could actually

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:08.149 
your finger and you could actually
scroll<00:01:07.320> through<00:01:07.530> the<00:01:07.619> different<00:01:07.740> ticker

00:01:08.149 --> 00:01:08.159 
scroll through the different ticker

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:10.100 
scroll through the different ticker
options<00:01:08.729> that<00:01:08.820> are<00:01:08.909> available<00:01:08.939> and<00:01:09.420> just<00:01:10.020> like

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:10.110 
options that are available and just like

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:13.310 
options that are available and just like
before<00:01:10.409> you<00:01:10.530> have<00:01:10.710> also<00:01:11.220> the<00:01:11.659> people<00:01:12.659> the<00:01:13.200> at

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:13.320 
before you have also the people the at

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:15.499 
before you have also the people the at
people<00:01:13.710> edge<00:01:13.890> of<00:01:14.400> contact<00:01:14.939> so<00:01:15.119> you<00:01:15.150> can<00:01:15.299> jump

00:01:15.499 --> 00:01:15.509 
people edge of contact so you can jump

00:01:15.509 --> 00:01:17.600 
people edge of contact so you can jump
to<00:01:15.600> your<00:01:15.990> contacts<00:01:16.560> at<00:01:16.680> any<00:01:16.830> time<00:01:17.009> and<00:01:17.250> then

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:17.610 
to your contacts at any time and then

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:18.980 
to your contacts at any time and then
you<00:01:17.729> would<00:01:17.850> now<00:01:18.030> have<00:01:18.060> this<00:01:18.420> new<00:01:18.600> feature<00:01:18.810> of

00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:18.990 
you would now have this new feature of

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:21.440 
you would now have this new feature of
app<00:01:19.229> shortcuts<00:01:20.159> so<00:01:20.400> if<00:01:20.460> you<00:01:20.549> want<00:01:20.729> to<00:01:20.820> you

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:21.450 
app shortcuts so if you want to you

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:22.700 
app shortcuts so if you want to you
could<00:01:21.570> launch<00:01:21.780> things<00:01:22.140> like<00:01:22.320> the<00:01:22.470> count

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:22.710 
could launch things like the count

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:24.859 
could launch things like the count
calendar<00:01:23.490> from<00:01:23.790> there<00:01:24.000> the<00:01:24.240> gallery<00:01:24.600> or<00:01:24.720> the

00:01:24.859 --> 00:01:24.869 
calendar from there the gallery or the

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:27.770 
calendar from there the gallery or the
camera<00:01:25.409> it's<00:01:25.890> just<00:01:26.009> another<00:01:26.549> way<00:01:26.909> of<00:01:26.939> actually

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:27.780 
camera it's just another way of actually

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:29.990 
camera it's just another way of actually
multitasking<00:01:28.710> so<00:01:29.100> if<00:01:29.159> you<00:01:29.280> didn't<00:01:29.520> if<00:01:29.939> you

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:30.000 
multitasking so if you didn't if you

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:31.249 
multitasking so if you didn't if you
didn't<00:01:30.210> want<00:01:30.329> to<00:01:30.420> go<00:01:30.540> through<00:01:30.780> the<00:01:30.960> recent

00:01:31.249 --> 00:01:31.259 
didn't want to go through the recent

00:01:31.259 --> 00:01:33.740 
didn't want to go through the recent
apps<00:01:31.590> menu<00:01:31.950> you<00:01:32.640> could<00:01:32.759> do<00:01:32.880> this<00:01:33.060> as<00:01:33.180> well<00:01:33.420> but

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:33.750 
apps menu you could do this as well but

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:35.600 
apps menu you could do this as well but
we<00:01:34.079> just<00:01:34.259> wish<00:01:34.439> they'd<00:01:34.619> enhance<00:01:35.220> the

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:35.610 
we just wish they'd enhance the

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:38.510 
we just wish they'd enhance the
functionality<00:01:36.570> of<00:01:36.810> the<00:01:37.140> dual<00:01:37.950> core<00:01:38.159> display

00:01:38.510 --> 00:01:38.520 
functionality of the dual core display

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:40.249 
functionality of the dual core display
just<00:01:38.549> a<00:01:38.909> little<00:01:39.090> bit<00:01:39.180> more<00:01:39.450> they<00:01:39.930> have<00:01:40.079> another

00:01:40.249 --> 00:01:40.259 
just a little bit more they have another

00:01:40.259 --> 00:01:42.050 
just a little bit more they have another
one<00:01:40.439> here<00:01:40.619> where<00:01:41.009> you<00:01:41.070> can<00:01:41.220> reposition<00:01:41.640> the
