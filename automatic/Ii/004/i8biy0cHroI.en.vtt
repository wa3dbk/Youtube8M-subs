00:00:37.030 --> 00:00:41.940
 of missing 

00:00:38.980 --> 00:00:41.940
 when I 

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:51.410
 Hello 

00:00:53.519 --> 00:00:56.519
 mayer 

00:00:58.820 --> 00:01:01.820
 with me 

00:01:05.530 --> 00:01:10.630
 for you that is going to talk a little bit about 

00:01:07.360 --> 00:01:13.090
 of skating what do you think of skating is 

00:01:10.630 --> 00:01:16.090
 a very beautiful sport and it is artistic 

00:01:13.090 --> 00:01:18.190
 here all the boys have fun and 

00:01:16.090 --> 00:01:21.670
 you can take it as a sport for all 

00:01:18.190 --> 00:01:25.720
 life and how did you decide to enter this 

00:01:21.670 --> 00:01:27.340
 good sport was from tiny 

00:01:25.720 --> 00:01:29.110
 curiosity should not detect ice 

00:01:27.340 --> 00:01:31.210
 because back then there was only one 

00:01:29.110 --> 00:01:34.280
 track and he and you shop greeted 

00:01:31.210 --> 00:01:36.170
 someone to your students who see you 

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:38.690
 clear yes to all my alumni 

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:41.150
 that come with a lot of love to greet me 

00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:43.970
 and the cen when the demands for you 

00:01:41.150 --> 00:01:46.190
 a lot of going and natalia that are going to 

00:01:43.970 --> 00:01:47.950
 talk a little about skating for 

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:51.259
 you want to present ice skating 

00:01:47.950 --> 00:01:53.740
 Well, my life, I like it a lot 

00:01:51.259 --> 00:01:55.990
 cooking the truth I would like 

00:01:53.740 --> 00:01:57.640
 because my whole life has skated because I 

00:01:55.990 --> 00:02:00.570
 I like it, I like it very much. 

00:01:57.640 --> 00:02:02.860
 as my profession to be a skater 

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:07.710
 different and natalia that represents 

00:02:02.860 --> 00:02:11.380
 ice skating images but I think that 

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:16.540
 you enjoy too much and it's not only 

00:02:11.380 --> 00:02:18.010
 as a passion when you feel that here 

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:20.110
 with problems it only has that good 

00:02:18.010 --> 00:02:21.970
 patina of security that is that while 

00:02:20.110 --> 00:02:24.550
 you like a lot of years like you feel 

00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:28.380
 I really like once participated in 

00:02:24.550 --> 00:02:31.650
 some competition continues to participate 

00:02:28.380 --> 00:02:34.620
 grand prix that are national and the and 

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:38.840
 Local stores can be the most 

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:41.670
 well the second place in the national 

00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:43.650
 with Gabriel and they're going to talk to us 

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:45.840
 about why they started a 

00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:47.850
 patinated and how we pay attention to 

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:49.980
 see tell me why we had the attention 

00:02:47.850 --> 00:02:51.750
 when in fact I had thought of doing 

00:02:49.980 --> 00:02:53.700
 a lot but then until we hardly 

00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:56.580
 we ventured long ago I wanted it 

00:02:53.700 --> 00:02:59.340
 do quito if we really wanted to live 

00:02:56.580 --> 00:03:01.440
 the experience of what to come to 

00:02:59.340 --> 00:03:02.940
 skid away the fear and then live 

00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:05.640
 the experience of more than a band and 

00:03:02.940 --> 00:03:07.620
 can get to skate artistic anything 

00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:09.360
 more they do it as a hobby or when it was 

00:03:07.620 --> 00:03:11.430
 small if now that then so 

00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:13.590
 complicated and not the truth is that it is not 

00:03:11.430 --> 00:03:15.810
 nothing more for fun and this then 

00:03:13.590 --> 00:03:17.460
 what would you say to the kids and what to come 

00:03:15.810 --> 00:03:19.290
 learn to skate like me asks 

00:03:17.460 --> 00:03:20.610
 to be encouraged but since you were little 

00:03:19.290 --> 00:03:22.710
 the truth is that without bigger ones is already 

00:03:20.610 --> 00:03:24.810
 complicated we are here has come to the 

00:03:22.710 --> 00:03:26.970
