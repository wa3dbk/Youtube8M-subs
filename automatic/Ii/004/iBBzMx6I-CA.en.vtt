will be in April some time for the

00:03:42.790 --> 00:03:44.339 
will be in April some time for the
tracker<00:03:43.000> mask<00:03:43.269> that's<00:03:43.630> the<00:03:43.750> one<00:03:43.870> I<00:03:43.900> predicted

00:03:44.339 --> 00:03:44.349 
tracker mask that's the one I predicted

00:03:44.349 --> 00:03:45.470 
tracker mask that's the one I predicted
would<00:03:44.440> look<00:03:44.620> the<00:03:44.860> best<00:03:45.040> out<00:03:45.190> of<00:03:45.220> the<00:03:45.400> three

00:03:45.470 --> 00:03:45.480 
would look the best out of the three

00:03:45.480 --> 00:03:47.610 
would look the best out of the three
it's<00:03:46.480> going<00:03:46.630> to<00:03:46.720> be<00:03:46.780> very<00:03:46.989> hard<00:03:47.140> to<00:03:47.260> top<00:03:47.470> this

00:03:47.610 --> 00:03:47.620 
it's going to be very hard to top this

00:03:47.620 --> 00:03:50.339 
it's going to be very hard to top this
one<00:03:47.799> off<00:03:48.569> so<00:03:49.569> we'll<00:03:49.720> see<00:03:49.870> how<00:03:49.989> it<00:03:50.140> goes

00:03:50.339 --> 00:03:50.349 
one off so we'll see how it goes

00:03:50.349 --> 00:03:53.580
