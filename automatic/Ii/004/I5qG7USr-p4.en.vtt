00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:24.570 
anterior approach is new and different

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:26.300 
anterior approach is new and different
you<00:01:24.840> don't<00:01:24.990> cut<00:01:25.110> any<00:01:25.350> muscle<00:01:25.770> at<00:01:25.860> all<00:01:26.009> and

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:26.310 
you don't cut any muscle at all and

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:30.050 
you don't cut any muscle at all and
therefore<00:01:27.299> the<00:01:27.659> restrictions<00:01:28.229> are<00:01:28.490> zero<00:01:29.490> that

was<00:01:30.479> music<00:01:30.990> today's<00:01:31.380> ears<00:01:31.770> I<00:01:32.220> love<00:01:32.579> the<00:01:32.700> idea

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:32.970 
was music today's ears I love the idea

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:34.520 
was music today's ears I love the idea
of<00:01:33.000> the<00:01:33.060> direct<00:01:33.329> anterior<00:01:33.509> approach<00:01:33.900> because

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:34.530 
of the direct anterior approach because

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:36.560 
of the direct anterior approach because
didn't<00:01:34.740> cut<00:01:34.890> any<00:01:35.009> muscles<00:01:35.369> which<00:01:36.329> meant<00:01:36.509> the

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:36.570 
didn't cut any muscles which meant the

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:38.210 
didn't cut any muscles which meant the
rehab<00:01:36.840> would<00:01:36.930> be<00:01:37.020> faster<00:01:37.470> it<00:01:37.619> meant<00:01:38.009> that<00:01:38.100> the

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:38.220 
rehab would be faster it meant that the

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:40.580 
rehab would be faster it meant that the
dislocation<00:01:39.030> would<00:01:39.210> be<00:01:39.590> basically

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:40.590 
dislocation would be basically

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:42.499 
dislocation would be basically
non-existent<00:01:40.829> from<00:01:41.400> day<00:01:41.549> one<00:01:41.759> just<00:01:42.299> weeks
