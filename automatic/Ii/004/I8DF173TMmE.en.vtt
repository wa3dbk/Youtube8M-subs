00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:38.070 
so I'm just going to switch them on at

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:45.670 
so I'm just going to switch them on at
the<00:01:38.130> very<00:01:38.280> same<00:01:38.549> time<00:01:43.310> so<00:01:44.310> as<00:01:44.610> you<00:01:45.000> can<00:01:45.119> see

Lumia 930 started a bit faster and
earlier<00:01:49.950> than<00:01:51.049> Lumia<00:01:52.049> 435<00:01:52.970> but<00:01:53.970> it's<00:01:54.299> just<00:01:54.570> the

earlier than Lumia 435 but it's just the

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:57.139 
earlier than Lumia 435 but it's just the
initial<00:01:55.049> state<00:01:55.380> let's<00:01:55.710> see<00:01:56.460> which<00:01:56.820> of<00:01:56.850> the

00:01:57.139 --> 00:01:57.149

so<00:02:19.170> you<00:02:19.980> can<00:02:20.130> clearly<00:02:20.460> see<00:02:20.700> that<00:02:20.990> Nokia<00:02:21.990> Lumia

00:02:22.070 --> 00:02:22.080 
so you can clearly see that Nokia Lumia

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:25.280 
so you can clearly see that Nokia Lumia
930<00:02:22.740> is<00:02:23.160> faster<00:02:24.030> than<00:02:24.210> Microsoft<00:02:24.630> Lumia<00:02:24.720> 435

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:25.290 
930 is faster than Microsoft Lumia 435

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:31.280 
930 is faster than Microsoft Lumia 435
obviously<00:02:26.090> so<00:02:27.260> let's<00:02:28.260> do<00:02:29.330> some<00:02:30.330> more<00:02:30.660> tests<00:02:30.930> on

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:31.290 
obviously so let's do some more tests on

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:38.210 
obviously so let's do some more tests on
our<00:02:31.440> devices<00:02:36.140> okay<00:02:37.140> here<00:02:37.740> we<00:02:37.830> go

00:02:38.210 --> 00:02:38.220 
our devices okay here we go

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:42.800 
our devices okay here we go
let's<00:02:38.760> check<00:02:40.310> which<00:02:41.310> device<00:02:41.730> open<00:02:42.150> sets<00:02:42.390> Lumia

00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:42.810 
let's check which device open sets Lumia

00:02:42.810 --> 00:02:45.440 
let's check which device open sets Lumia
camera<00:02:42.890> faster<00:02:43.890> so<00:02:44.610> here<00:02:44.880> we<00:02:45.030> are<00:02:45.060> having<00:02:45.180> the

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:45.450 
camera faster so here we are having the

00:02:45.450 --> 00:02:47.720 
camera faster so here we are having the
Lumia<00:02:45.690> camera<00:02:45.720> on<00:02:46.110> our<00:02:46.200> Lumia<00:02:46.800> 930<00:02:47.010> and<00:02:47.490> here

00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:47.730 
Lumia camera on our Lumia 930 and here

00:02:47.730 --> 00:02:51.080 
Lumia camera on our Lumia 930 and here
it<00:02:47.850> is<00:02:47.970> on<00:02:48.270> our<00:02:48.570> Lumia<00:02:48.900> 435<00:02:49.290> so<00:02:50.280> just<00:02:50.580> tap<00:02:50.940> on

00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:51.090 
it is on our Lumia 435 so just tap on

00:02:51.090 --> 00:02:56.770 
it is on our Lumia 435 so just tap on
them<00:02:51.270> simultaneously<00:02:52.910> and<00:02:53.910> let's<00:02:54.150> see<00:02:55.670> so

00:02:56.770 --> 00:02:56.780 
them simultaneously and let's see so

00:02:56.780 --> 00:02:58.790 
them simultaneously and let's see so
Romanian<00:02:57.780> truck<00:02:57.900> is<00:02:57.990> faster<00:02:58.350> it's<00:02:58.470> already

00:02:58.790 --> 00:02:58.800 
Romanian truck is faster it's already

00:02:58.800 --> 00:03:03.380 
Romanian truck is faster it's already
opened<00:02:59.160> and<00:02:59.930> now<00:03:00.930> we<00:03:00.990> got<00:03:01.320> it<00:03:01.470> on<00:03:01.620> Lumia<00:03:02.459> 435<00:03:02.940> so

00:03:03.380 --> 00:03:03.390 
opened and now we got it on Lumia 435 so

00:03:03.390 --> 00:03:04.730 
opened and now we got it on Lumia 435 so
you<00:03:03.480> can<00:03:03.750> see<00:03:03.930> the<00:03:04.110> difference<00:03:04.410> in<00:03:04.530> the<00:03:04.620> speed

00:03:04.730 --> 00:03:04.740 
you can see the difference in the speed

00:03:04.740 --> 00:03:07.310 
you can see the difference in the speed
how<00:03:05.160> much<00:03:05.340> time<00:03:05.520> it<00:03:05.670> takes<00:03:05.820> on<00:03:06.200> humanity<00:03:07.200> and

00:03:07.310 --> 00:03:07.320 
how much time it takes on humanity and

00:03:07.320 --> 00:03:08.840 
how much time it takes on humanity and
how<00:03:07.410> much<00:03:07.590> time<00:03:07.709> it's<00:03:08.130> going<00:03:08.340> to<00:03:08.430> take<00:03:08.520> on

00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:08.850 
how much time it's going to take on

00:03:08.850 --> 00:03:16.550 
how much time it's going to take on
Lumia<00:03:09.600> 435<00:03:10.070> now<00:03:11.070> let's<00:03:11.340> go<00:03:11.489> back<00:03:12.260> and<00:03:15.560> let's

00:03:16.550 --> 00:03:16.560 
Lumia 435 now let's go back and let's

00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:21.979 
Lumia 435 now let's go back and let's
open<00:03:19.010> Nokia<00:03:20.010> mix<00:03:20.280> radio<00:03:20.730> on<00:03:21.120> both<00:03:21.630> of<00:03:21.810> our

00:03:21.979 --> 00:03:21.989 
open Nokia mix radio on both of our

00:03:21.989 --> 00:03:25.360 
open Nokia mix radio on both of our
devices<00:03:22.380> and<00:03:22.830> let's<00:03:23.040> see<00:03:23.720> which<00:03:24.720> one<00:03:24.989> is

00:03:25.360 --> 00:03:25.370 
devices and let's see which one is

00:03:25.370 --> 00:03:31.530 
devices and let's see which one is
faster

00:03:31.530 --> 00:03:31.540 

00:03:31.540 --> 00:03:36.539 

so<00:03:32.290> once<00:03:32.500> again<00:03:32.650> the<00:03:32.860> winner<00:03:33.069> was<00:03:35.280> Nokia<00:03:36.280> Lumia

00:03:36.539 --> 00:03:36.549 
so once again the winner was Nokia Lumia

00:03:36.549 --> 00:03:45.690 
so once again the winner was Nokia Lumia
930<00:03:43.230> let's<00:03:44.230> do<00:03:44.620> this<00:03:44.769> test<00:03:45.099> once<00:03:45.400> again

00:03:45.690 --> 00:03:45.700 
930 let's do this test once again

00:03:45.700 --> 00:03:51.240 
930 let's do this test once again
because<00:03:46.860> mixer<00:03:47.860> day<00:03:47.980> was<00:03:48.160> not<00:03:50.010> already<00:03:51.010> set<00:03:51.220> up

00:03:51.240 --> 00:03:51.250 
because mixer day was not already set up

00:03:51.250 --> 00:03:55.740 
because mixer day was not already set up
on<00:03:52.379> Lumia<00:03:53.379> 435<00:03:53.739> so<00:03:54.160> it's<00:03:55.060> a<00:03:55.180> start<00:03:55.360> it<00:03:55.540> once

00:03:55.740 --> 00:03:55.750 
on Lumia 435 so it's a start it once

00:03:55.750 --> 00:03:58.250 
on Lumia 435 so it's a start it once
again

00:03:58.250 --> 00:03:58.260 

00:03:58.260 --> 00:04:01.530 

so<00:03:59.260> obviously<00:03:59.829> the<00:04:00.069> winner<00:04:00.310> is<00:04:00.459> Lumia<00:04:00.790> 435<00:04:01.150> but

00:04:01.530 --> 00:04:01.540 
so obviously the winner is Lumia 435 but

00:04:01.540 --> 00:04:04.500 
so obviously the winner is Lumia 435 but
the<00:04:01.690> difference<00:04:02.110> is<00:04:02.319> minor<00:04:03.180> while<00:04:04.180> opening

00:04:04.500 --> 00:04:04.510 
the difference is minor while opening

00:04:04.510 --> 00:04:07.490 
the difference is minor while opening
the<00:04:04.860> no<00:04:05.860> chemical<00:04:06.220> review<00:04:06.459> application<00:04:07.060> on

00:04:07.490 --> 00:04:07.500 
the no chemical review application on

00:04:07.500 --> 00:04:14.220 
the no chemical review application on
Lumia<00:04:08.500> 930<00:04:08.680> and<00:04:08.920> Lumia<00:04:09.489> 435<00:04:12.840> next<00:04:13.840> to<00:04:13.989> another

00:04:14.220 --> 00:04:14.230 
Lumia 930 and Lumia 435 next to another

00:04:14.230 --> 00:04:23.430 
Lumia 930 and Lumia 435 next to another
test<00:04:14.560> here<00:04:15.840> we<00:04:16.840> are<00:04:16.870> going<00:04:17.380> to<00:04:19.680> test<00:04:21.750> the<00:04:22.750> web

00:04:23.430 --> 00:04:23.440 
test here we are going to test the web

00:04:23.440 --> 00:04:25.230 
test here we are going to test the web
browsing<00:04:23.680> speed<00:04:23.979> here<00:04:24.669> we<00:04:24.820> are<00:04:24.850> having<00:04:25.000> the

00:04:25.230 --> 00:04:25.240 
browsing speed here we are having the

00:04:25.240 --> 00:04:27.930 
browsing speed here we are having the
bookmarks<00:04:25.660> for<00:04:25.840> Shanna<00:04:26.620> the.com<00:04:27.010> on<00:04:27.400> both<00:04:27.789> of

00:04:27.930 --> 00:04:27.940 
bookmarks for Shanna the.com on both of

00:04:27.940 --> 00:04:31.260 
bookmarks for Shanna the.com on both of
our<00:04:28.150> smart<00:04:28.840> phones<00:04:29.050> so<00:04:29.880> the<00:04:30.880> device<00:04:31.120> is

00:04:31.260 --> 00:04:31.270 
our smart phones so the device is

00:04:31.270 --> 00:04:33.330 
our smart phones so the device is
connected<00:04:31.449> to<00:04:31.630> the<00:04:31.810> same<00:04:31.960> internet<00:04:32.380> Wi-Fi

00:04:33.330 --> 00:04:33.340 
connected to the same internet Wi-Fi

00:04:33.340 --> 00:04:35.760 
connected to the same internet Wi-Fi
network<00:04:33.760> right<00:04:33.940> now<00:04:34.150> so<00:04:34.479> we<00:04:34.750> were<00:04:34.870> just<00:04:35.260> going

00:04:35.760 --> 00:04:35.770 
network right now so we were just going

00:04:35.770 --> 00:04:37.770 
network right now so we were just going
to<00:04:35.919> open<00:04:36.160> the<00:04:36.250> home<00:04:36.430> page<00:04:36.639> of<00:04:36.789> channel<00:04:37.539> a.com

00:04:37.770 --> 00:04:37.780 
to open the home page of channel a.com

00:04:37.780 --> 00:04:40.200 
to open the home page of channel a.com
and<00:04:37.960> let's<00:04:38.260> see<00:04:38.470> which<00:04:39.400> of<00:04:39.430> the<00:04:39.669> browser<00:04:39.940> which

00:04:40.200 --> 00:04:40.210 
and let's see which of the browser which

00:04:40.210 --> 00:04:49.740 
and let's see which of the browser which
device<00:04:40.570> opens<00:04:41.110> it<00:04:41.260> first

00:04:49.740 --> 00:04:49.750 

00:04:49.750 --> 00:04:54.820 

okay<00:04:50.750> so<00:04:51.819> from<00:04:52.819> here<00:04:53.000> 435<00:04:53.629> is<00:04:53.810> faster<00:04:54.259> here<00:04:54.500> for

00:04:54.820 --> 00:04:54.830 
okay so from here 435 is faster here for

00:04:54.830 --> 00:05:09.170 
okay so from here 435 is faster here for
some<00:04:55.039> reason<00:05:00.039> okay

00:05:09.170 --> 00:05:09.180 

00:05:09.180 --> 00:05:17.960 

so

00:05:17.960 --> 00:05:17.970 

00:05:17.970 --> 00:05:20.660 

it's<00:05:18.510> illuminant<00:05:19.110> it<00:05:19.260> is<00:05:19.380> a<00:05:19.440> still<00:05:19.770> faster<00:05:20.340> as

00:05:20.660 --> 00:05:20.670 
it's illuminant it is a still faster as

00:05:20.670 --> 00:05:24.260 
it's illuminant it is a still faster as
you<00:05:21.360> can<00:05:21.540> see<00:05:21.780> with<00:05:22.380> the<00:05:22.440> page<00:05:22.940> okay<00:05:23.940> so<00:05:24.000> the

00:05:24.260 --> 00:05:24.270 
you can see with the page okay so the

00:05:24.270 --> 00:05:26.710 
you can see with the page okay so the
processing<00:05:24.750> is<00:05:24.870> is<00:05:25.260> finished<00:05:25.860> now<00:05:26.010> on<00:05:26.310> our

00:05:26.710 --> 00:05:26.720 
processing is is finished now on our

00:05:26.720 --> 00:05:29.360 
processing is is finished now on our
rocky<00:05:27.720> domain<00:05:28.020> entity<00:05:28.350> but<00:05:28.470> it's<00:05:28.770> still<00:05:29.160> going

00:05:29.360 --> 00:05:29.370 
rocky domain entity but it's still going

00:05:29.370 --> 00:05:31.550 
rocky domain entity but it's still going
on<00:05:29.640> on<00:05:29.970> for<00:05:30.270> 35<00:05:30.600> minutes<00:05:30.720> just<00:05:31.110> finished<00:05:31.410> now

00:05:31.550 --> 00:05:31.560 
on on for 35 minutes just finished now

00:05:31.560 --> 00:05:34.580 
on on for 35 minutes just finished now
so<00:05:31.800> as<00:05:32.790> you<00:05:33.120> can<00:05:33.240> see<00:05:33.300> it<00:05:33.510> was<00:05:33.690> still<00:05:34.200> a<00:05:34.380> bit

00:05:34.580 --> 00:05:34.590 
so as you can see it was still a bit

00:05:34.590 --> 00:05:45.800 
so as you can see it was still a bit
slower<00:05:34.890> than<00:05:35.840> Lumia<00:05:36.840> 930<00:05:44.240> okay<00:05:45.240> one<00:05:45.390> more<00:05:45.540> test

00:05:45.800 --> 00:05:45.810 
slower than Lumia 930 okay one more test

00:05:45.810 --> 00:05:48.410 
slower than Lumia 930 okay one more test
we<00:05:46.200> can<00:05:46.380> do<00:05:46.500> here<00:05:46.740> as<00:05:46.920> the<00:05:47.640> entropy

00:05:48.410 --> 00:05:48.420 
we can do here as the entropy

00:05:48.420 --> 00:05:50.870 
we can do here as the entropy
benchmarking<00:05:49.050> test<00:05:49.410> on<00:05:49.680> both<00:05:49.740> of<00:05:50.730> these

00:05:50.870 --> 00:05:50.880 
benchmarking test on both of these

00:05:50.880 --> 00:05:55.010 
benchmarking test on both of these
devices<00:05:51.210> and<00:05:51.870> let's<00:05:52.230> see<00:05:52.580> what<00:05:53.580> a<00:05:53.850> score<00:05:54.360> both

00:05:55.010 --> 00:05:55.020 
devices and let's see what a score both

00:05:55.020 --> 00:05:58.750 
devices and let's see what a score both
of<00:05:55.230> these<00:05:55.380> devices<00:05:55.710> are<00:05:56.160> going<00:05:56.310> to<00:05:56.460> get<00:05:56.900> so<00:05:57.900> as

00:05:58.750 --> 00:05:58.760 
of these devices are going to get so as

00:05:58.760 --> 00:06:02.120 
of these devices are going to get so as
you<00:05:59.760> can<00:05:59.940> see<00:06:00.180> the<00:06:00.390> previously<00:06:01.040> tested<00:06:02.040> a

00:06:02.120 --> 00:06:02.130 
you can see the previously tested a

00:06:02.130 --> 00:06:04.490 
you can see the previously tested a
score<00:06:02.430> for<00:06:02.640> Nokia<00:06:03.360> Lumia<00:06:03.480> 930<00:06:03.750> is<00:06:04.110> twenty<00:06:04.320> five

00:06:04.490 --> 00:06:04.500 
score for Nokia Lumia 930 is twenty five

00:06:04.500 --> 00:06:06.850 
score for Nokia Lumia 930 is twenty five
thousand<00:06:04.830> seven<00:06:04.950> hundred<00:06:05.130> ninety<00:06:05.340> six<00:06:05.730> while

00:06:06.850 --> 00:06:06.860 
thousand seven hundred ninety six while

00:06:06.860 --> 00:06:10.940 
thousand seven hundred ninety six while
our<00:06:07.860> Lumia<00:06:08.640> 435<00:06:09.090> is<00:06:09.450> it's<00:06:09.930> just<00:06:10.290> underneath

00:06:10.940 --> 00:06:10.950 
our Lumia 435 is it's just underneath

00:06:10.950 --> 00:06:12.800 
our Lumia 435 is it's just underneath
seven<00:06:11.760> thousand<00:06:12.030> four<00:06:12.150> hundred<00:06:12.270> ninety<00:06:12.690> seven

seven thousand four hundred ninety seven

00:06:12.810 --> 00:06:15.200 
seven thousand four hundred ninety seven
but<00:06:13.680> still<00:06:13.980> let's<00:06:14.190> do<00:06:14.490> the<00:06:14.580> test<00:06:14.700> once<00:06:14.940> again

00:06:15.200 --> 00:06:15.210 
but still let's do the test once again

00:06:15.210 --> 00:06:21.020 
but still let's do the test once again
and<00:06:17.360> let's<00:06:18.360> have<00:06:18.510> a<00:06:18.660> look<00:06:18.810> on<00:06:19.670> this<00:06:20.670> course

00:06:21.020 --> 00:06:21.030 
and let's have a look on this course

00:06:21.030 --> 00:06:32.680 
and let's have a look on this course
right<00:06:21.870> now

00:06:32.680 --> 00:06:32.690 

00:06:32.690 --> 00:06:43.029 

as<00:06:32.750> you<00:06:33.410> can<00:06:33.560> see<00:06:33.770> lumen<00:06:34.160> entered<00:06:34.460> is<00:06:34.580> faster

00:06:43.029 --> 00:06:43.039 

00:06:43.039 --> 00:06:45.909 

so<00:06:43.669> the<00:06:43.939> test<00:06:44.150> was<00:06:44.270> over<00:06:44.419> and<00:06:45.319> once<00:06:45.529> again<00:06:45.680> the

00:06:45.909 --> 00:06:45.919 
so the test was over and once again the

00:06:45.919 --> 00:06:49.959 
so the test was over and once again the
score<00:06:46.219> is<00:06:46.719> 25,000<00:06:47.719> for<00:06:48.619> our<00:06:49.069> lumia<00:06:49.460> 930<00:06:49.669> and

00:06:49.959 --> 00:06:49.969 
score is 25,000 for our lumia 930 and

00:06:49.969 --> 00:06:53.379 
score is 25,000 for our lumia 930 and
let's<00:06:50.300> see<00:06:50.629> what<00:06:50.900> we<00:06:51.110> gonna<00:06:51.499> get<00:06:51.740> on<00:06:51.949> a<00:06:52.399> 435<00:06:53.360> and

00:06:53.379 --> 00:06:53.389 
let's see what we gonna get on a 435 and

00:06:53.389 --> 00:06:58.779 
let's see what we gonna get on a 435 and
that<00:06:53.809> is<00:06:54.729> 7500<00:06:55.729> once<00:06:55.939> again<00:06:56.270> so<00:06:56.990> as<00:06:57.669> you<00:06:58.669> can

00:06:58.779 --> 00:06:58.789 
that is 7500 once again so as you can

00:06:58.789 --> 00:06:59.320 
that is 7500 once again so as you can
see

00:06:59.320 --> 00:06:59.330 
see

00:06:59.330 --> 00:07:02.200 
see
Nokia<00:06:59.689> Lumia<00:06:59.749> 930<00:07:00.399> scored<00:07:01.399> more<00:07:01.610> than<00:07:01.669> price

00:07:02.200 --> 00:07:02.210 
Nokia Lumia 930 scored more than price

00:07:02.210 --> 00:07:11.639 
Nokia Lumia 930 scored more than price
of<00:07:02.569> our<00:07:03.159> Lumia<00:07:04.159> 435<00:07:04.610> here<00:07:06.520> so<00:07:07.520> let's<00:07:08.029> go<00:07:08.149> back

00:07:11.639 --> 00:07:11.649 

00:07:11.649 --> 00:07:14.350 

what<00:07:12.649> else<00:07:12.830> let's<00:07:13.159> go<00:07:13.490> to<00:07:13.550> the<00:07:13.789> messaging

00:07:14.350 --> 00:07:14.360 
what else let's go to the messaging

00:07:14.360 --> 00:07:21.059 
what else let's go to the messaging
application<00:07:14.899> and<00:07:15.139> see<00:07:15.499> which<00:07:16.430> one<00:07:16.669> opens<00:07:17.360> fast

00:07:21.059 --> 00:07:21.069 

00:07:21.069 --> 00:07:24.329 

so<00:07:22.069> this<00:07:22.819> time<00:07:23.059> both<00:07:23.389> of<00:07:23.539> these<00:07:23.659> devices

00:07:24.329 --> 00:07:24.339 
so this time both of these devices

00:07:24.339 --> 00:07:27.129 
so this time both of these devices
nearly<00:07:25.339> open<00:07:26.089> the<00:07:26.240> messaging<00:07:26.629> application

00:07:27.129 --> 00:07:27.139 
nearly open the messaging application

00:07:27.139 --> 00:07:29.980 
nearly open the messaging application
simultaneously<00:07:27.949> so<00:07:28.939> that's<00:07:29.659> all<00:07:29.809> for<00:07:29.960> now

00:07:29.980 --> 00:07:29.990 
simultaneously so that's all for now

00:07:29.990 --> 00:07:31.389 
simultaneously so that's all for now
