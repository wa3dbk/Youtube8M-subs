00:02:09.100 --> 00:02:09.110 
definitely put style over accuracy the

00:02:09.110 --> 00:02:11.140 
definitely put style over accuracy the
charger<00:02:09.530> for<00:02:09.770> example<00:02:10.250> is<00:02:10.399> very<00:02:10.520> slab-sided

00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:11.150 
charger for example is very slab-sided

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:14.440 
charger for example is very slab-sided
here<00:02:11.980> it<00:02:12.980> looks<00:02:13.310> like<00:02:13.400> it's<00:02:13.670> got<00:02:13.879> a<00:02:14.060> full

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:14.450 
here it looks like it's got a full

00:02:14.450 --> 00:02:17.410 
here it looks like it's got a full
interior<00:02:14.810> a<00:02:15.230> full<00:02:16.220> stock<00:02:16.520> interior<00:02:17.120> I<00:02:17.150> should

say
which<00:02:19.040> I<00:02:19.190> don't<00:02:19.250> think<00:02:19.550> any<00:02:19.700> of<00:02:19.790> the<00:02:19.970> fast<00:02:20.150> and

00:02:20.350 --> 00:02:20.360 
which I don't think any of the fast and

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:25.450 
which I don't think any of the fast and
furious<00:02:20.660> chargers<00:02:21.050> have<00:02:21.200> ever<00:02:21.380> had<00:02:23.320> but<00:02:24.460> the

00:02:25.450 --> 00:02:25.460 
furious chargers have ever had but the

00:02:25.460 --> 00:02:30.010 
furious chargers have ever had but the
wheels<00:02:25.730> are<00:02:26.210> very<00:02:26.600> well<00:02:26.810> done<00:02:26.960> and<00:02:28.000> the<00:02:29.020> engine

00:02:30.010 --> 00:02:30.020 
wheels are very well done and the engine

00:02:30.020 --> 00:02:31.810 
wheels are very well done and the engine
looks<00:02:30.200> pretty<00:02:30.410> cool<00:02:30.590> so<00:02:30.830> I'll<00:02:30.890> be<00:02:31.040> able<00:02:31.310> to<00:02:31.490> use

00:02:31.810 --> 00:02:31.820 
looks pretty cool so I'll be able to use

00:02:31.820 --> 00:02:36.870 
looks pretty cool so I'll be able to use
that<00:02:32.030> first<00:02:32.210> parts<00:02:34.720> and<00:02:35.720> just<00:02:36.140> for<00:02:36.290> comparison

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:36.880 
that first parts and just for comparison

00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:41.680 
that first parts and just for comparison
here<00:02:37.880> it<00:02:38.000> is<00:02:38.120> -<00:02:38.360> the<00:02:38.510> Ravel<00:02:38.840> charger<00:02:40.690> aside

great<00:02:54.470> for<00:02:54.710> parts<00:02:55.070> I'll<00:02:56.030> actually<00:02:56.780> be<00:02:57.170> doing<00:02:57.410> a

00:02:57.610 --> 00:02:57.620 
great for parts I'll actually be doing a

00:02:57.620 --> 00:03:01.840 
great for parts I'll actually be doing a
wheel<00:02:57.770> swap<00:02:58.070> between<00:02:58.490> these<00:02:58.700> two<00:02:59.200> and<00:03:00.850> then

00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:01.850 
wheel swap between these two and then

00:03:01.850 --> 00:03:03.760 
wheel swap between these two and then
this<00:03:02.060> will<00:03:02.210> be<00:03:02.360> the<00:03:02.660> basis<00:03:03.140> for<00:03:03.170> the<00:03:03.410> street
