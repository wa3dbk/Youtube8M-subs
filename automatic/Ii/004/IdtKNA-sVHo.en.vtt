with now the two that we have here we
have<00:00:10.440> we<00:00:11.370> have<00:00:11.460> a<00:00:11.490> children's<00:00:11.820> Python<00:00:12.120> in<00:00:12.509> this

00:00:12.650 --> 00:00:12.660 
have we have a children's Python in this

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:14.450 
have we have a children's Python in this
page<00:00:13.110> in<00:00:13.320> the<00:00:13.500> instant<00:00:13.769> closure<00:00:13.950> right<00:00:14.219> here

00:00:14.450 --> 00:00:14.460 
page in the instant closure right here

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:16.550 
page in the instant closure right here
and<00:00:14.670> then<00:00:15.120> this<00:00:15.360> one<00:00:15.509> over<00:00:15.540> here<00:00:15.929> we<00:00:16.379> do<00:00:16.529> have

00:00:16.550 --> 00:00:16.560 
and then this one over here we do have

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:18.740 
and then this one over here we do have
an<00:00:16.980> Australian<00:00:17.340> coastal<00:00:17.670> cup<00:00:17.850> of<00:00:18.000> Python<00:00:18.359> so

00:00:18.740 --> 00:00:18.750 
an Australian coastal cup of Python so

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:21.200 
an Australian coastal cup of Python so
now<00:00:19.529> I'll<00:00:19.740> show<00:00:19.980> you<00:00:20.010> first<00:00:20.340> is<00:00:20.730> the

00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:21.210 
now I'll show you first is the

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:23.980 
now I'll show you first is the
children's<00:00:21.750> Python<00:00:21.930> now<00:00:22.769> it's<00:00:23.070> only<00:00:23.220> about

00:00:23.980 --> 00:00:23.990 
children's Python now it's only about

00:00:23.990 --> 00:00:27.019 
children's Python now it's only about
only<00:00:24.990> met<00:00:25.140> two<00:00:25.350> years<00:00:25.590> old<00:00:25.830> now<00:00:26.130> these<00:00:26.730> are

00:00:27.019 --> 00:00:27.029 
only met two years old now these are

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:29.750 
only met two years old now these are
just<00:00:27.330> going<00:00:27.810> to<00:00:27.900> find<00:00:28.080> these<00:00:28.859> are<00:00:29.070> one<00:00:29.250> of<00:00:29.279> the

00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:29.760 
just going to find these are one of the

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:32.389 
just going to find these are one of the
smallest<00:00:30.210> species<00:00:30.929> of<00:00:31.140> life<00:00:31.410> in<00:00:31.619> in<00:00:31.920> the<00:00:32.160> world

00:00:32.389 --> 00:00:32.399 
smallest species of life in in the world

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:34.130 
smallest species of life in in the world
not<00:00:32.730> just<00:00:32.790> in<00:00:33.000> a<00:00:33.090> strain<00:00:33.329> like<00:00:33.480> in<00:00:33.660> the<00:00:33.780> world

00:00:34.130 --> 00:00:34.140 
not just in a strain like in the world

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:37.010 
not just in a strain like in the world
it<00:00:34.440> gives<00:00:34.590> about<00:00:34.770> a<00:00:34.800> meter<00:00:35.480> meter<00:00:36.480> 30<00:00:36.840> if

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:37.020 
it gives about a meter meter 30 if

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:37.670 
it gives about a meter meter 30 if
you're<00:00:37.170> lucky

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:37.680 
you're lucky

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:49.650 
you're lucky
so<00:00:38.040> I'm<00:00:38.850> just<00:00:39.000> going<00:00:39.149> to<00:00:39.210> have<00:00:39.360> a<00:00:39.390> look<00:00:39.510> around

00:00:49.650 --> 00:00:49.660 

00:00:49.660 --> 00:00:54.040 

so<00:00:50.660> this<00:00:50.960> is<00:00:51.380> my<00:00:52.360> Australian<00:00:53.360> children's

00:00:54.040 --> 00:00:54.050 
so this is my Australian children's

00:00:54.050 --> 00:00:56.800 
so this is my Australian children's
Python<00:00:54.500> so<00:00:55.400> this<00:00:55.880> one<00:00:56.000> about<00:00:56.150> two<00:00:56.330> years<00:00:56.480> old

00:00:56.800 --> 00:00:56.810 
Python so this one about two years old

00:00:56.810 --> 00:01:00.190 
Python so this one about two years old
they're<00:00:57.380> not<00:00:57.530> very<00:00:57.710> fast<00:00:58.280> faster<00:00:59.120> growers<00:00:59.570> so

00:01:00.190 --> 00:01:00.200 
they're not very fast faster growers so

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:02.410 
they're not very fast faster growers so
it<00:01:01.130> takes<00:01:01.430> a<00:01:01.550> while<00:01:01.700> for<00:01:01.730> them<00:01:01.970> to<00:01:02.030> get<00:01:02.300> to

00:01:02.410 --> 00:01:02.420 
it takes a while for them to get to

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:04.869 
it takes a while for them to get to
their<00:01:02.540> full<00:01:02.780> size<00:01:03.050> but<00:01:03.770> you<00:01:03.950> know<00:01:04.070> I<00:01:04.280> had<00:01:04.730> this

00:01:04.869 --> 00:01:04.879 
their full size but you know I had this

00:01:04.879 --> 00:01:07.420 
their full size but you know I had this
guy<00:01:05.120> since<00:01:05.420> he<00:01:05.660> was<00:01:05.810> a<00:01:05.840> little<00:01:06.080> baby<00:01:06.350> so<00:01:06.979> we've

00:01:07.420 --> 00:01:07.430 
guy since he was a little baby so we've

00:01:07.430 --> 00:01:09.370 
guy since he was a little baby so we've
grown<00:01:07.640> up<00:01:07.790> together<00:01:07.970> and<00:01:08.180> you<00:01:08.360> know<00:01:08.540> we<00:01:09.229> yell

00:01:09.370 --> 00:01:09.380 
grown up together and you know we yell

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:11.380 
grown up together and you know we yell
I'm<00:01:09.500> just<00:01:09.710> fine<00:01:09.950> and<00:01:10.490> I<00:01:10.580> bring<00:01:10.760> closer<00:01:10.970> just<00:01:11.270> so

00:01:11.380 --> 00:01:11.390 
I'm just fine and I bring closer just so

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:13.450 
I'm just fine and I bring closer just so
you<00:01:11.450> can<00:01:11.540> see<00:01:11.810> now<00:01:12.800> he's<00:01:12.920> very<00:01:13.010> unusual

00:01:13.450 --> 00:01:13.460 
you can see now he's very unusual

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:15.820 
you can see now he's very unusual
because<00:01:13.580> most<00:01:13.729> spotted<00:01:14.330> most<00:01:15.110> um<00:01:15.320> children's

00:01:15.820 --> 00:01:15.830 
because most spotted most um children's

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:16.870 
because most spotted most um children's
pythons<00:01:16.190> you<00:01:16.250> have<00:01:16.370> a<00:01:16.400> lot<00:01:16.520> of<00:01:16.610> pattern<00:01:16.820> on

00:01:16.870 --> 00:01:16.880 
pythons you have a lot of pattern on

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:19.560 
pythons you have a lot of pattern on
this<00:01:17.120> one<00:01:17.360> just<00:01:18.020> has<00:01:18.229> like<00:01:18.410> a<00:01:18.440> pure<00:01:18.740> white

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:19.570 
this one just has like a pure white

00:01:19.570 --> 00:01:22.330 
this one just has like a pure white
underbelly<00:01:20.570> the<00:01:21.140> same<00:01:21.380> as<00:01:21.560> all<00:01:21.830> the<00:01:21.950> pythons

00:01:22.330 --> 00:01:22.340 
underbelly the same as all the pythons

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:24.880 
underbelly the same as all the pythons
do<00:01:22.520> but<00:01:23.509> doesn't<00:01:23.720> have<00:01:23.869> any<00:01:24.050> coloration<00:01:24.710> at

00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:24.890 
do but doesn't have any coloration at

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:27.580 
do but doesn't have any coloration at
all<00:01:25.070> like<00:01:25.400> no<00:01:26.060> spots<00:01:26.540> or<00:01:26.660> anything<00:01:26.900> to<00:01:27.380> get

00:01:27.580 --> 00:01:27.590 
all like no spots or anything to get

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:31.050 
all like no spots or anything to get
right<00:01:27.970> to<00:01:28.970> the<00:01:29.090> head<00:01:29.270> you<00:01:30.140> can<00:01:30.290> sort<00:01:30.619> of<00:01:30.680> just

00:01:31.050 --> 00:01:31.060 
right to the head you can sort of just

00:01:31.060 --> 00:01:33.730 
right to the head you can sort of just
it<00:01:32.060> brings<00:01:32.270> his<00:01:32.479> head<00:01:32.600> back<00:01:32.780> around<00:01:32.930> you<00:01:33.650> can

00:01:33.730 --> 00:01:33.740 
it brings his head back around you can

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:34.960 
it brings his head back around you can
just<00:01:33.920> send<00:01:34.040> the<00:01:34.130> rest<00:01:34.250> of<00:01:34.340> the<00:01:34.399> body<00:01:34.580> is<00:01:34.700> just<00:01:34.910> a

00:01:34.960 --> 00:01:34.970 
just send the rest of the body is just a

00:01:34.970 --> 00:01:36.370 
just send the rest of the body is just a
normal<00:01:35.240> color<00:01:35.390> but<00:01:35.869> it<00:01:35.930> does<00:01:36.080> have<00:01:36.259> that

00:01:36.370 --> 00:01:36.380 
normal color but it does have that

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:39.969 
normal color but it does have that
iridescent<00:01:36.790> glow<00:01:37.790> which<00:01:38.509> is<00:01:38.720> awesome<00:01:39.110> now

00:01:39.969 --> 00:01:39.979 
iridescent glow which is awesome now

00:01:39.979 --> 00:01:41.710 
iridescent glow which is awesome now
these<00:01:40.160> ones<00:01:40.310> here<00:01:40.580> most<00:01:40.910> pythons<00:01:41.420> in

00:01:41.710 --> 00:01:41.720 
these ones here most pythons in

00:01:41.720 --> 00:01:44.260 
these ones here most pythons in
captivity<00:01:42.110> live<00:01:42.830> anywhere<00:01:43.160> from<00:01:43.310> 20<00:01:43.729> to<00:01:43.759> 25

00:01:44.260 --> 00:01:44.270 
captivity live anywhere from 20 to 25

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:46.540 
captivity live anywhere from 20 to 25
years<00:01:44.540> so<00:01:44.899> I<00:01:45.140> feel<00:01:45.619> a<00:01:45.680> long<00:01:45.860> time<00:01:46.070> so<00:01:46.340> you<00:01:46.399> know

00:01:46.540 --> 00:01:46.550 
years so I feel a long time so you know

00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:48.900 
years so I feel a long time so you know
they're<00:01:46.759> great<00:01:46.940> pets<00:01:47.210> they're<00:01:47.509> awesome

00:01:48.900 --> 00:01:48.910 
they're great pets they're awesome

00:01:48.910 --> 00:01:51.070 
they're great pets they're awesome
mostly<00:01:49.910> during<00:01:50.180> some<00:01:50.479> time<00:01:50.509> because<00:01:50.780> it<00:01:50.960> is<00:01:50.990> a

00:01:51.070 --> 00:01:51.080 
mostly during some time because it is a

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:53.980 
mostly during some time because it is a
summer<00:01:51.470> time<00:01:51.680> now<00:01:51.830> in<00:01:51.979> Australia<00:01:52.250> so<00:01:53.000> most<00:01:53.900> of

00:01:53.980 --> 00:01:53.990 
summer time now in Australia so most of

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:56.770

00:03:02.850 --> 00:03:02.860 
from here he's got one height up here

00:03:02.860 --> 00:03:05.880 
from here he's got one height up here
and<00:03:03.250> then<00:03:03.490> also<00:03:03.640> on<00:03:04.090> this<00:03:04.480> base<00:03:05.260> on<00:03:05.560> the<00:03:05.650> ground

00:03:05.880 --> 00:03:05.890 
and then also on this base on the ground

00:03:05.890 --> 00:03:08.730 
and then also on this base on the ground
just<00:03:06.460> here<00:03:06.910> there's<00:03:07.750> also<00:03:07.930> a<00:03:08.080> heat<00:03:08.350> map<00:03:08.530> on

00:03:08.730 --> 00:03:08.740 
just here there's also a heat map on

00:03:08.740 --> 00:03:10.680 
just here there's also a heat map on
this<00:03:08.890> side<00:03:09.130> now<00:03:09.820> the<00:03:09.880> only<00:03:10.120> reason<00:03:10.240> why<00:03:10.420> I<00:03:10.450> do

00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:10.690 
this side now the only reason why I do

00:03:10.690 --> 00:03:12.450 
this side now the only reason why I do
have<00:03:11.080> a<00:03:11.110> vine<00:03:11.380> in<00:03:11.500> theirs<00:03:11.650> at<00:03:11.830> night<00:03:12.010> on<00:03:12.250> this

00:03:12.450 --> 00:03:12.460 
have a vine in theirs at night on this

00:03:12.460 --> 00:03:15.120 
have a vine in theirs at night on this
he<00:03:12.760> does<00:03:12.970> like<00:03:13.270> to<00:03:13.300> climb<00:03:13.830> there<00:03:14.830> is<00:03:14.950> right

00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:15.130 
he does like to climb there is right

00:03:15.130 --> 00:03:16.860 
he does like to climb there is right
there<00:03:15.160> he<00:03:15.910> doesn't<00:03:16.210> like<00:03:16.300> the<00:03:16.420> climb<00:03:16.600> so<00:03:16.750> I<00:03:16.780> had

00:03:16.860 --> 00:03:16.870 
there he doesn't like the climb so I had

00:03:16.870 --> 00:03:18.660 
there he doesn't like the climb so I had
to<00:03:16.930> put<00:03:17.080> that<00:03:17.140> in<00:03:17.290> there<00:03:17.440> now<00:03:17.950> I'm<00:03:18.100> using<00:03:18.310> a<00:03:18.490> rep

00:03:18.660 --> 00:03:18.670 
to put that in there now I'm using a rep

00:03:18.670 --> 00:03:20.610 
to put that in there now I'm using a rep
debark<00:03:19.000> for<00:03:19.510> the<00:03:19.600> substrate<00:03:19.990> rep<00:03:20.260> debark<00:03:20.530> I

00:03:20.610 --> 00:03:20.620 
debark for the substrate rep debark I

00:03:20.620 --> 00:03:22.740 
debark for the substrate rep debark I
gotta<00:03:20.770> tell<00:03:20.980> you<00:03:21.040> one<00:03:21.160> of<00:03:21.250> the<00:03:21.310> best<00:03:21.660> that<00:03:22.660> I've

00:03:22.740 --> 00:03:22.750 
gotta tell you one of the best that I've

00:03:22.750 --> 00:03:24.450 
gotta tell you one of the best that I've
ever<00:03:22.900> used<00:03:23.170> and<00:03:23.440> at<00:03:23.770> the<00:03:23.890> moment<00:03:24.070> I<00:03:24.250> have<00:03:24.370> the

00:03:24.450 --> 00:03:24.460 
ever used and at the moment I have the

temperature set on about 25 degrees

00:03:26.110 --> 00:03:27.870 
temperature set on about 25 degrees
because<00:03:26.470> it<00:03:26.560> gets<00:03:26.680> really<00:03:26.920> hot<00:03:27.190> and<00:03:27.370> you<00:03:27.850> don't

because it gets really hot and you don't
need<00:03:28.270> it<00:03:28.420> you<00:03:28.570> don't<00:03:28.930> need<00:03:28.990> it<00:03:29.050> massively<00:03:29.470> hot
