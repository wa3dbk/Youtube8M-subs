00:00:01.170 --> 00:00:02.380
 of course 

00:00:02.380 --> 00:00:05.380
 Facebook 

00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:08.389
 but no 

00:00:08.389 --> 00:00:11.389
 claro 

00:00:16.789 --> 00:00:20.730
 create a potted vegetable garden to be placed maybe balcony 

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:24.769
 I keep a small but precious crop of genuine vegetables 

00:00:24.769 --> 00:00:27.869
 it is an easy and inexpensive project 

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:30.029
 the materials needed are few 

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:34.830
 a rather wide and deep cassette some new fertile soil 

00:00:34.830 --> 00:00:38.080
 a bag of expanded clay balls 

00:00:38.080 --> 00:00:41.200
 type of liquid fertilizer how to install 

00:00:41.200 --> 00:00:45.750
 watering are hectares and of course a choice of vegetables easily 

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:49.310
 available in already developed jars and ready for transplanting 

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:54.980
 it is convenient to choose a variety of vegetables of rapid but limited development 

00:00:55.820 --> 00:00:59.190
 in this case a napoli tomato was chosen 

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:02.260
 an eggplant grafted white photo 

00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:03.840
 two small signals 

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:06.890
 it is a hot pepper 

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:11.440
 the minimum recommended size for the box is 60 

00:01:11.440 --> 00:01:12.570
 centimeters 

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:14.990
 a width of 30 centimeters 

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:17.990
 and a depth of 28 30 centimeters 

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:23.690
 the box must have drainage holes on the bottom for the leakage 

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:24.500
 water 

00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:28.579
 a piece of belluno a fabric should be spent on the bottom 

00:01:28.579 --> 00:01:31.999
 which allows the water to filter but - the grains of earth 

00:01:33.010 --> 00:01:37.950
 on this ground is spread a layer of clay balls essential for 

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:40.180
 create a draining layer 

00:01:40.180 --> 00:01:43.710
 in this way the soil will remain moist mannooo phrasing 

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:48.750
 on the clay another piece of non-woven thread is spread to prevent the 

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:51.510
 soil mix with the swamps 

00:01:51.510 --> 00:01:55.650
 it is time to prepare the pot with universal earth xd 

00:01:55.650 --> 00:01:57.520
 best quality 

00:01:57.520 --> 00:02:00.729
 Fill the cassette up to about three fingers below the edge 

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:04.659
 oilb gently compact the surface 

00:02:04.659 --> 00:02:07.110
 to eliminate the sac 

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:11.320
 to create hearts destined to receive the radical clothes of plants 

00:02:11.320 --> 00:02:14.469
 you can also use the handy plant tool. 

00:02:14.469 --> 00:02:17.380
 that you extract a certain amount of soil 

00:02:17.380 --> 00:02:20.859
 forming a suitable recess another chiana 

00:02:20.859 --> 00:02:23.370
 place the napoli tomato in the center 

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:26.680
 gently displacing it without breaking the radical bread 

00:02:27.649 --> 00:02:29.819
 inserted into the hole 

00:02:29.819 --> 00:02:32.059
 cover with a little bit of pot 

00:02:32.059 --> 00:02:35.439
 and pressed to stabilize the plant in its 7 

00:02:36.549 --> 00:02:38.660
 at the sides in the same way 

00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:40.749
 insert the other specimens 

00:02:40.749 --> 00:02:42.149
 the celery 

00:02:42.149 --> 00:02:43.549
 eggplant 

00:02:43.549 --> 00:02:46.779
 the chili pepper 

00:02:46.779 --> 00:02:49.939
 top up with a little soil to even out the surface 

00:02:51.869 --> 00:02:56.249
 at this point insert 3 packets of bamboo arranged in a triangle 

00:02:56.249 --> 00:03:00.159
 on which will be tied branches of the tomato as they grow 

00:03:01.839 --> 00:03:06.029
 fasten the chopsticks at the top with a bit of metal wire book string 

00:03:09.579 --> 00:03:13.649
 water gently using water at room temperature 

00:03:14.239 --> 00:03:18.269
 you are too cold in fact it can cause stress to the root system of the 

00:03:18.269 --> 00:03:19.729
 vegetables 

00:03:19.729 --> 00:03:23.179
 only after completing the watering will it be time to cook 

00:03:23.920 --> 00:03:26.089
 on the already finished ground 

00:03:26.089 --> 00:03:29.269
 to facilitate the absorption of nutrients 

00:03:29.999 --> 00:03:34.149
 take a small amount of fertilizer granules and sprinkle on 

00:03:34.149 --> 00:03:35.369
 surface 

00:03:35.369 --> 00:03:39.249
 not excessive because too much nourishment seriously alice the plants 

00:03:40.069 --> 00:03:41.369
 a suggestion 

00:03:41.369 --> 00:03:45.609
 insert the plant labels in the soil to remember the name of the plant 

00:03:45.609 --> 00:03:47.509
 variety 

00:03:47.509 --> 00:03:50.750
 it is advisable to spread a layer of clay in the saucer 

00:03:50.750 --> 00:03:53.409
 watering it to always keep one 

00:03:53.409 --> 00:03:54.469
 thus creating 

00:03:54.469 --> 00:03:56.639
 microclima ito 

00:03:56.639 --> 00:04:01.439
 the clay will also prevent the bottom of the vessel from being immersed 

00:04:01.439 --> 00:04:05.199
 in the water that comes out of the fury after the watering always for the purpose of 

00:04:05.199 --> 00:04:08.129
 limit the risk of root stagnation 

00:04:08.129 --> 00:04:11.169
 the harvest will be ready in a few weeks 

00:04:11.169 --> 00:04:14.129
 said to bring to the table for those who love healthy foods
