so<00:00:03.590> now<00:00:03.739> we<00:00:03.800> built<00:00:04.160> our<00:00:04.340> kit<00:00:04.550> but<00:00:05.000> we<00:00:05.120> should

00:00:05.290 --> 00:00:05.300 
so now we built our kit but we should

00:00:05.300 --> 00:00:08.379 
so now we built our kit but we should
explore<00:00:05.720> mixing<00:00:06.380> the<00:00:06.500> kit<00:00:06.879> doing<00:00:07.879> gain<00:00:08.149> on

00:00:08.379 --> 00:00:08.389 
explore mixing the kit doing gain on

00:00:08.389 --> 00:00:09.940 
explore mixing the kit doing gain on
just<00:00:08.660> the<00:00:08.809> individual<00:00:09.230> sections<00:00:09.469> isn't

00:00:09.940 --> 00:00:09.950 
just the individual sections isn't

00:00:09.950 --> 00:00:11.490 
just the individual sections isn't
really<00:00:10.129> going<00:00:10.280> to<00:00:10.340> do<00:00:10.430> it<00:00:10.580> for<00:00:10.730> us

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:11.500 
really going to do it for us

really going to do it for us
some<00:00:12.500> people<00:00:12.769> might<00:00:12.950> go<00:00:13.160> over<00:00:13.309> the<00:00:13.550> channel

00:00:13.870 --> 00:00:13.880 
some people might go over the channel

00:00:13.880 --> 00:00:16.839 
some people might go over the channel

a<00:01:35.830> stereo<00:01:36.250> room<00:01:36.870> leak<00:01:37.870> tambourine<00:01:38.680> shaker<00:01:39.130> and

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:39.430 
a stereo room leak tambourine shaker and

00:01:39.430 --> 00:01:42.680 
a stereo room leak tambourine shaker and
handclaps<00:01:40.080> now<00:01:41.080> we<00:01:41.140> can<00:01:41.440> really<00:01:41.830> mix<00:01:42.160> the<00:01:42.310> kit

00:01:42.680 --> 00:01:42.690 
handclaps now we can really mix the kit

00:01:42.690 --> 00:03:51.630 
handclaps now we can really mix the kit
so<00:01:43.690> let's<00:01:43.869> try<00:01:44.020> just<00:01:44.170> volume<00:01:44.560> and<00:01:44.710> panning

00:03:51.630 --> 00:03:51.640 

00:03:51.640 --> 00:03:54.010 

okay<00:03:52.640> so<00:03:52.730> that's<00:03:52.910> just<00:03:53.120> volume<00:03:53.630> and<00:03:53.780> panning

00:03:54.010 --> 00:03:54.020 
okay so that's just volume and panning

00:03:54.020 --> 00:03:55.390 
okay so that's just volume and panning
on<00:03:54.200> the<00:03:54.290> drum<00:03:54.500> kit<00:03:54.680> just<00:03:54.860> get<00:03:55.070> them<00:03:55.220> in<00:03:55.310> the

00:03:55.390 --> 00:03:55.400 
on the drum kit just get them in the

00:03:55.400 --> 00:03:57.580 
on the drum kit just get them in the
right<00:03:55.550> place<00:03:55.850> and<00:03:56.660> of<00:03:56.780> course<00:03:56.959> if<00:03:57.080> I<00:03:57.140> wanted<00:03:57.440> to

00:03:57.580 --> 00:03:57.590 
right place and of course if I wanted to

00:03:57.590 --> 00:03:59.800 
right place and of course if I wanted to
I<00:03:57.620> can<00:03:57.860> go<00:03:57.950> to<00:03:58.040> each<00:03:58.220> individual<00:03:58.940> element<00:03:59.150> such

00:03:59.800 --> 00:03:59.810 
I can go to each individual element such

00:03:59.810 --> 00:04:01.960 
I can go to each individual element such
as<00:03:59.959> the<00:04:00.080> kick<00:04:00.320> and<00:04:00.620> I<00:04:01.040> can<00:04:01.190> start<00:04:01.489> putting

00:04:01.960 --> 00:04:01.970 
as the kick and I can start putting

00:04:01.970 --> 00:05:48.400 
as the kick and I can start putting
processing<00:04:02.780> directly<00:04:03.170> on<00:04:03.290> them

00:05:48.400 --> 00:05:48.410 

00:05:48.410 --> 00:05:50.629 

so<00:05:49.410> yeah<00:05:49.560> essentially<00:05:49.919> this<00:05:50.190> whole<00:05:50.370> thing

00:05:50.629 --> 00:05:50.639 
so yeah essentially this whole thing

00:05:50.639 --> 00:05:55.219 
so yeah essentially this whole thing
pops<00:05:50.910> up<00:05:51.210> as<00:05:52.099> multi-output<00:05:53.099> kit<00:05:53.490> and<00:05:54.050> we<00:05:55.050> can

00:05:55.219 --> 00:05:55.229 
pops up as multi-output kit and we can

00:05:55.229 --> 00:05:57.110 
pops up as multi-output kit and we can
put<00:05:55.530> processing<00:05:56.039> on<00:05:56.190> it<00:05:56.220> and<00:05:56.490> it's<00:05:57.060> a

00:05:57.110 --> 00:05:57.120 
put processing on it and it's a

00:05:57.120 --> 00:05:58.730 
put processing on it and it's a
beautiful<00:05:57.479> thing<00:05:57.599> the<00:05:57.870> fact<00:05:58.320> that<00:05:58.380> it<00:05:58.530> auto

00:05:58.730 --> 00:05:58.740 
beautiful thing the fact that it auto

00:05:58.740 --> 00:06:01.790 
beautiful thing the fact that it auto
names<00:05:59.160> all<00:05:59.400> the<00:05:59.430> different<00:05:59.970> pieces<00:06:00.120> is<00:06:00.800> really

00:06:01.790 --> 00:06:01.800 
names all the different pieces is really

00:06:01.800 --> 00:06:03.800 
names all the different pieces is really
cool<00:06:02.039> now<00:06:03.030> let's<00:06:03.240> go<00:06:03.330> ahead<00:06:03.389> and<00:06:03.570> check<00:06:03.690> out

00:06:03.800 --> 00:06:03.810
