00:03:49.240 --> 00:03:49.250 
is how you build a light bulb aquarium

00:03:49.250 --> 00:03:50.770 
is how you build a light bulb aquarium
well<00:03:49.730> that's<00:03:50.000> how<00:03:50.120> you<00:03:50.150> prepare<00:03:50.510> the<00:03:50.630> light

00:03:50.770 --> 00:03:50.780 
well that's how you prepare the light

00:03:50.780 --> 00:03:51.640 
well that's how you prepare the light
bulb<00:03:51.019> anyways

00:03:51.640 --> 00:03:51.650 
bulb anyways

00:03:51.650 --> 00:03:54.610 
bulb anyways
so<00:03:52.310> as<00:03:52.610> you<00:03:52.700> can<00:03:52.820> see<00:03:52.930> this<00:03:53.930> is<00:03:54.049> all<00:03:54.200> out<00:03:54.410> of<00:03:54.440> the

00:03:56.770 --> 00:03:56.780 
light bulb now and the light bulb is

00:03:56.780 --> 00:03:58.990 
light bulb now and the light bulb is
good<00:03:56.959> to<00:03:57.049> go<00:03:57.230> and<00:03:57.459> you<00:03:58.459> want<00:03:58.610> to<00:03:58.730> make<00:03:58.970> sure

00:03:58.990 --> 00:03:59.000

00:04:03.370 --> 00:04:03.380 
of glass on the side here and after

00:04:03.380 --> 00:04:05.650 
of glass on the side here and after
you're<00:04:03.500> done<00:04:03.680> wash<00:04:04.430> this<00:04:04.760> out<00:04:05.000> so<00:04:05.390> really

00:04:05.650 --> 00:04:05.660 
you're done wash this out so really

00:04:05.660 --> 00:04:07.630 
you're done wash this out so really
rinse<00:04:06.049> this<00:04:06.260> out<00:04:06.410> if<00:04:06.709> it's<00:04:06.829> coated<00:04:07.100> and<00:04:07.459> the

00:04:07.630 --> 00:04:07.640 
rinse this out if it's coated and the

00:04:07.640 --> 00:04:09.789 
rinse this out if it's coated and the
inside<00:04:07.970> to<00:04:08.090> remove<00:04:08.329> other<00:04:08.510> coating<00:04:09.019> just<00:04:09.650> use

00:04:09.789 --> 00:04:09.799 
inside to remove other coating just use

00:04:09.799 --> 00:04:11.199 
inside to remove other coating just use
some<00:04:09.829> cold<00:04:10.250> water<00:04:10.459> with<00:04:10.730> this<00:04:10.790> mixed<00:04:11.060> with

00:04:11.199 --> 00:04:11.209 
some cold water with this mixed with

00:04:11.209 --> 00:04:14.039 
some cold water with this mixed with
salt<00:04:11.470> swish<00:04:12.470> it<00:04:12.590> around<00:04:12.650> a<00:04:12.890> bit<00:04:13.010> like<00:04:13.160> this<00:04:13.340> and

00:04:14.039 --> 00:04:14.049 
salt swish it around a bit like this and

00:04:14.049 --> 00:04:16.860 
salt swish it around a bit like this and
the<00:04:15.049> coating<00:04:15.260> should<00:04:15.530> come<00:04:15.680> off<00:04:15.769> real<00:04:16.039> easy

00:04:16.860 --> 00:04:16.870 
the coating should come off real easy

00:04:16.870 --> 00:04:19.060 
the coating should come off real easy
that's<00:04:17.870> for<00:04:18.109> what<00:04:18.260> you<00:04:18.350> can<00:04:18.470> keep<00:04:18.680> in<00:04:18.829> here<00:04:18.979> as

00:05:09.059 --> 00:05:11.149 
here's the finished product this is the
light<00:05:09.719> bulb<00:05:09.870> aquarium<00:05:10.409> I<00:05:10.499> made<00:05:10.649> for<00:05:10.860> my<00:05:10.949> mother

00:05:11.149 --> 00:05:11.159 
light bulb aquarium I made for my mother

00:05:11.159 --> 00:05:15.350 
light bulb aquarium I made for my mother
and<00:05:11.569> I<00:05:13.520> realized<00:05:14.520> a<00:05:14.639> few<00:05:14.669> mistakes<00:05:14.909> I've<00:05:15.330> made

00:05:15.350 --> 00:05:15.360 
and I realized a few mistakes I've made

00:05:15.360 --> 00:05:17.119 
and I realized a few mistakes I've made
with<00:05:15.809> it<00:05:15.960> now<00:05:16.080> I<00:05:16.110> didn't<00:05:16.439> make<00:05:16.529> the<00:05:16.680> substrate

00:05:17.119 --> 00:05:17.129 
with it now I didn't make the substrate

00:05:17.129 --> 00:05:19.339 
with it now I didn't make the substrate
deep<00:05:17.370> enough<00:05:17.610> so<00:05:17.849> the<00:05:17.969> plans<00:05:18.300> keep<00:05:18.930> on<00:05:19.050> rooting

00:05:19.339 --> 00:05:19.349 
deep enough so the plans keep on rooting

00:05:19.349 --> 00:05:22.339 
deep enough so the plans keep on rooting
themself<00:05:19.740> and<00:05:20.099> floating<00:05:20.939> to<00:05:21.059> the<00:05:21.089> surface<00:05:21.349> and

00:05:22.339 --> 00:05:22.349
