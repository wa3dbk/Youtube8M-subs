piece<00:04:32.050> in<00:04:32.229> this<00:04:32.620> corner<00:04:33.039> here<00:04:33.539> wanted<00:04:34.539> to<00:04:34.690> be

00:04:34.800 --> 00:04:34.810 
piece in this corner here wanted to be

00:04:34.810 --> 00:04:36.480 
piece in this corner here wanted to be
in<00:04:35.020> between<00:04:35.139> the<00:04:35.440> two<00:04:35.620> flaps<00:04:35.889> you<00:04:36.039> just<00:04:36.280> fold

00:04:36.480 --> 00:04:36.490 
in between the two flaps you just fold

00:04:36.490 --> 00:04:39.029 
in between the two flaps you just fold
it<00:04:36.610> in<00:04:36.759> you<00:04:37.120> just<00:04:37.300> tucked<00:04:37.539> in<00:04:37.720> okay<00:04:38.199> so<00:04:38.860> on<00:04:39.009> a

00:04:39.029 --> 00:04:39.039 
it in you just tucked in okay so on a

it in you just tucked in okay so on a
fold<00:04:39.370> it<00:04:39.520> put<00:04:39.820> us<00:04:39.849> in<00:04:40.180> the<00:04:40.419> middle<00:04:40.509> just<00:04:40.870> like

00:04:40.980 --> 00:04:40.990 
fold it put us in the middle just like

00:04:40.990 --> 00:04:47.249 
fold it put us in the middle just like
that<00:04:42.150> okay<00:04:43.500> and<00:04:44.500> then<00:04:45.060> continue<00:04:46.080> sucking<00:04:47.080> the

00:04:47.249 --> 00:04:47.259 
that okay and then continue sucking the

00:04:47.259 --> 00:04:50.999 
that okay and then continue sucking the
corners<00:04:47.740> in<00:04:49.020> grab<00:04:50.020> the<00:04:50.139> next<00:04:50.380> piece<00:04:50.620> do<00:04:50.889> the

00:04:50.999 --> 00:04:51.009 
corners in grab the next piece do the

00:04:51.009 --> 00:04:55.020 
corners in grab the next piece do the
same<00:04:51.250> thing<00:04:51.750> it's<00:04:52.750> like<00:04:52.900> that<00:04:53.169> and<00:04:53.880> like<00:04:54.880> I

00:04:55.020 --> 00:04:55.030 
same thing it's like that and like I

00:04:55.030 --> 00:04:58.050 
same thing it's like that and like I
said<00:04:55.150> the<00:04:55.300> post-it<00:04:55.630> notes<00:04:55.840> if<00:04:56.080> you<00:04:56.470> are<00:04:57.060> there

00:04:58.050 --> 00:04:58.060 
said the post-it notes if you are there

00:04:58.060 --> 00:05:00.300 
said the post-it notes if you are there
a<00:04:58.090> lot<00:04:58.270> easier<00:04:58.840> to<00:04:59.409> make<00:04:59.620> because<00:05:00.009> they're

00:05:00.300 --> 00:05:00.310 
a lot easier to make because they're

00:05:00.310 --> 00:05:02.610 
a lot easier to make because they're
already<00:05:00.460> pre-cut<00:05:01.150> squares<00:05:01.479> otherwise<00:05:02.409> you

00:05:02.610 --> 00:05:02.620 
already pre-cut squares otherwise you

00:05:02.620 --> 00:05:04.230 
already pre-cut squares otherwise you
have<00:05:02.650> to<00:05:02.740> cut<00:05:02.949> printer<00:05:03.400> paper<00:05:03.550> into<00:05:03.940> squares

00:05:04.230 --> 00:05:04.240 
have to cut printer paper into squares

00:05:04.240 --> 00:05:09.240 
have to cut printer paper into squares
and<00:05:04.620> just<00:05:05.620> takes<00:05:06.039> a<00:05:06.159> lot<00:05:06.490> more<00:05:06.520> time<00:05:07.409> so<00:05:08.409> also

00:05:09.240 --> 00:05:09.250 
and just takes a lot more time so also

00:05:09.250 --> 00:05:11.070 
and just takes a lot more time so also
when<00:05:09.639> you<00:05:09.729> do<00:05:09.880> them<00:05:10.000> back-to-back<00:05:10.270> like<00:05:10.870> this

00:05:11.070 --> 00:05:11.080 
when you do them back-to-back like this

00:05:11.080 --> 00:05:12.959 
when you do them back-to-back like this
it<00:05:11.259> makes<00:05:11.320> it<00:05:11.530> a<00:05:11.680> lot<00:05:11.949> more<00:05:12.009> durable<00:05:12.550> not<00:05:12.789> going

00:05:12.959 --> 00:05:12.969 
it makes it a lot more durable not going

00:05:12.969 --> 00:05:15.089 
it makes it a lot more durable not going
to<00:05:13.030> bend<00:05:13.210> nearly<00:05:13.630> as<00:05:13.750> easy<00:05:13.900> they're<00:05:14.889> not<00:05:14.979> going

00:05:15.089 --> 00:05:15.099 
to bend nearly as easy they're not going

00:05:15.099 --> 00:05:18.170 
to bend nearly as easy they're not going
to<00:05:15.159> fall<00:05:15.370> apart<00:05:15.490> nearly<00:05:16.030> as<00:05:16.090> easy<00:05:16.830> that<00:05:17.830> way

00:05:18.170 --> 00:05:18.180 
to fall apart nearly as easy that way

00:05:18.180 --> 00:05:22.200 
to fall apart nearly as easy that way
when<00:05:19.180> you<00:05:19.270> go<00:05:19.479> to<00:05:20.229> throw<00:05:20.469> them<00:05:20.740> and<00:05:21.060> they<00:05:22.060> hit

00:05:22.200 --> 00:05:22.210 
when you go to throw them and they hit

00:05:22.210 --> 00:05:23.700 
when you go to throw them and they hit
the<00:05:22.330> ground<00:05:22.449> or<00:05:22.840> you<00:05:22.930> hit<00:05:23.080> your<00:05:23.199> friend<00:05:23.530> with

00:05:23.700 --> 00:05:23.710 
the ground or you hit your friend with

00:05:23.710 --> 00:05:24.899 
the ground or you hit your friend with
some<00:05:23.889> or<00:05:24.070> whatever<00:05:24.280> you're<00:05:24.520> gonna<00:05:24.580> do<00:05:24.789> with

00:05:24.899 --> 00:05:24.909 
some or whatever you're gonna do with

00:05:24.909 --> 00:05:27.209 
some or whatever you're gonna do with
them<00:05:25.060> they<00:05:26.050> won't<00:05:26.229> break<00:05:26.590> and<00:05:26.860> you<00:05:26.919> want<00:05:27.070> to

00:05:27.209 --> 00:05:27.219 
them they won't break and you want to

00:05:27.219 --> 00:05:28.239 
them they won't break and you want to
make<00:05:27.310> a<00:05:27.370> new<00:05:27.550> one

00:05:28.239 --> 00:05:28.249 
make a new one

00:05:28.249 --> 00:05:30.219 
make a new one
so<00:05:29.149> if<00:05:29.239> you<00:05:29.329> have<00:05:29.449> two<00:05:29.599> different<00:05:29.719> colors<00:05:30.109> just

00:05:30.219 --> 00:05:30.229 
so if you have two different colors just

00:05:30.229 --> 00:05:33.039 
so if you have two different colors just
keep<00:05:30.439> going<00:05:30.709> odd<00:05:31.459> colors<00:05:31.969> as<00:05:32.239> you<00:05:32.749> know<00:05:32.899> it's

00:05:33.039 --> 00:05:33.049 
keep going odd colors as you know it's

00:05:33.049 --> 00:05:35.699 
keep going odd colors as you know it's
on<00:05:33.139> the<00:05:33.229> last<00:05:33.439> two<00:05:33.679> you'll<00:05:34.099> start<00:05:34.399> to<00:05:34.459> overlap

00:05:35.699 --> 00:05:35.709 
on the last two you'll start to overlap

00:05:35.709 --> 00:05:38.019 
on the last two you'll start to overlap
okay<00:05:36.709> that<00:05:36.919> is<00:05:37.039> perfectly<00:05:37.459> fine<00:05:37.549> us<00:05:37.849> how<00:05:37.939> it

00:05:38.019 --> 00:05:38.029 
okay that is perfectly fine us how it

00:05:38.029 --> 00:05:40.419 
okay that is perfectly fine us how it
should<00:05:38.239> be<00:05:38.739> then<00:05:39.739> you<00:05:39.799> want<00:05:39.919> to<00:05:40.069> tuck<00:05:40.309> the

00:05:40.419 --> 00:05:40.429 
should be then you want to tuck the

00:05:40.429 --> 00:05:43.409 
should be then you want to tuck the
flaps<00:05:40.669> and<00:05:40.909> of<00:05:40.969> course<00:05:41.239> have<00:05:41.899> you<00:05:41.989> been<00:05:42.139> doing

00:05:43.409 --> 00:05:43.419 
flaps and of course have you been doing

00:05:43.419 --> 00:05:45.549 
flaps and of course have you been doing
the<00:05:44.419> last<00:05:44.449> piece<00:05:44.809> is<00:05:44.959> really<00:05:44.989> going<00:05:45.469> to

00:05:45.549 --> 00:05:45.559 
the last piece is really going to

00:05:45.559 --> 00:05:48.009 
the last piece is really going to
overlap<00:05:46.059> but<00:05:47.059> don't<00:05:47.269> worry<00:05:47.419> about<00:05:47.659> it'll<00:05:47.899> be

00:05:48.009 --> 00:05:48.019 
overlap but don't worry about it'll be

00:05:48.019 --> 00:05:50.439 
overlap but don't worry about it'll be
just<00:05:48.199> fine<00:05:48.469> it's<00:05:48.769> how<00:05:48.829> we<00:05:48.889> want<00:05:49.189> it<00:05:49.309> tuck<00:05:50.299> the

flap sins and here you go and I have
these<00:05:55.549> two<00:05:55.759> overlapping<00:05:56.389> pieces<00:05:56.719> as<00:05:57.169> you<00:05:57.409> see

00:05:57.639 --> 00:05:57.649 
these two overlapping pieces as you see

00:05:57.649 --> 00:06:00.309 
these two overlapping pieces as you see
these<00:05:58.339> legs<00:05:58.549> here<00:05:58.909> and<00:05:59.209> they<00:05:59.389> perfectly<00:06:00.079> lined

00:06:00.309 --> 00:06:00.319 
these legs here and they perfectly lined

00:06:00.319 --> 00:06:02.499 
these legs here and they perfectly lined
up<00:06:00.469> like<00:06:00.619> they<00:06:00.769> would<00:06:00.919> be<00:06:01.129> and<00:06:01.339> you<00:06:02.269> want<00:06:02.419> to

00:06:02.499 --> 00:06:02.509 
up like they would be and you want to

00:06:02.509 --> 00:06:05.049 
up like they would be and you want to
kind<00:06:02.689> of<00:06:02.779> bend<00:06:03.049> it<00:06:03.229> a<00:06:03.439> little<00:06:03.769> bit<00:06:04.129> to<00:06:04.759> get<00:06:04.879> to

00:06:05.049 --> 00:06:05.059 
kind of bend it a little bit to get to

00:06:05.059 --> 00:06:07.209 
kind of bend it a little bit to get to
go<00:06:05.179> in<00:06:05.299> between<00:06:05.449> here<00:06:05.839> make<00:06:06.499> sure<00:06:06.529> this<00:06:06.799> corner

00:06:07.209 --> 00:06:07.219 
go in between here make sure this corner

00:06:07.219 --> 00:06:08.859 
go in between here make sure this corner
of<00:06:07.309> course<00:06:07.549> then<00:06:07.699> between<00:06:07.879> the<00:06:07.969> two<00:06:08.239> flaps

00:06:08.859 --> 00:06:08.869 
of course then between the two flaps

00:06:08.869 --> 00:06:12.249 
of course then between the two flaps
that<00:06:09.049> you<00:06:09.139> tucked<00:06:09.409> in<00:06:09.589> earlier<00:06:10.429> and<00:06:11.259> slide

00:06:12.249 --> 00:06:12.259 
that you tucked in earlier and slide

00:06:12.259 --> 00:06:15.519 
that you tucked in earlier and slide
them<00:06:12.379> in<00:06:12.610> and<00:06:13.610> then<00:06:13.659> the<00:06:14.659> last<00:06:14.869> two<00:06:15.049> pieces<00:06:15.229> I

00:06:15.519 --> 00:06:15.529 
them in and then the last two pieces I

00:06:15.529 --> 00:06:17.229 
them in and then the last two pieces I
you<00:06:15.589> have<00:06:15.739> to<00:06:15.829> tuck<00:06:16.039> in<00:06:16.249> you<00:06:16.819> want<00:06:16.969> to<00:06:17.059> go<00:06:17.149> ahead

00:06:17.229 --> 00:06:17.239 
you have to tuck in you want to go ahead

00:06:17.239 --> 00:06:20.829 
you have to tuck in you want to go ahead
and<00:06:17.449> like<00:06:17.599> kind<00:06:18.589> of<00:06:18.619> like<00:06:18.679> pre-bent<00:06:19.549> them<00:06:19.839> so

00:06:20.829 --> 00:06:20.839 
and like kind of like pre-bent them so

00:06:20.839 --> 00:06:22.929 
and like kind of like pre-bent them so
it's<00:06:20.989> a<00:06:21.049> lot<00:06:21.199> easier<00:06:21.259> to<00:06:21.649> get<00:06:21.860> in<00:06:22.069> it's<00:06:22.789> like

00:06:22.929 --> 00:06:22.939 
it's a lot easier to get in it's like

00:06:22.939 --> 00:06:26.859 
it's a lot easier to get in it's like
this<00:06:24.579> right<00:06:25.579> and<00:06:25.789> since<00:06:26.419> there's<00:06:26.599> a<00:06:26.659> piece

00:06:26.859 --> 00:06:26.869 
this right and since there's a piece
