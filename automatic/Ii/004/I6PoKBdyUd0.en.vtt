00:00:10.809 --> 00:00:15.950
 special what it means indicated 

00:00:13.910 --> 00:00:18.050
 special has the champions league for 

00:00:15.950 --> 00:00:19.790
 you as a coach and cross for the tico 

00:00:18.050 --> 00:00:22.040
 madrid as a club good as a club or 

00:00:19.790 --> 00:00:27.189
 important not because many years ago 

00:00:22.040 --> 00:00:30.230
 that we do not participate and history 

00:00:27.189 --> 00:00:32.899
 you need and must work to participate 

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:35.180
 then we give a lot of value to him 

00:00:32.899 --> 00:00:37.460
 last year have been competing 

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:39.710
 the way we introduce we have 

00:00:37.460 --> 00:00:41.900
 responsibility as the goal of 

00:00:39.710 --> 00:00:44.000
 club enter the champions and start 

00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:45.320
 to enter the champions that yes 

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:47.930
 It is a necessity to continue growing 

00:00:45.320 --> 00:00:50.260
 and be year after year improving both in 

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:53.260
 the economic as in the sport 

00:00:50.260 --> 00:00:55.660
 this allows us to get to know the and 

00:00:53.260 --> 00:00:57.579
 having more experience each year and with 

00:00:55.660 --> 00:00:59.920
 your experience as a player in changes 

00:00:57.579 --> 00:01:02.620
 final lines towards the club and even a 

00:00:59.920 --> 00:01:04.600
 end gives that part with some advantage to 

00:01:02.620 --> 00:01:07.600
 the good mental health time I think 

00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:11.049
 that gives us the peace of mind 

00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:12.940
 understood that we can compete that does not 

00:01:11.049 --> 00:01:15.340
 gives no chance that because 

00:01:12.940 --> 00:01:16.570
 you competed very well the results are going to 

00:01:15.340 --> 00:01:19.330
 naturally come what is true 

00:01:16.570 --> 00:01:21.880
 that many of these guys who follow 

00:01:19.330 --> 00:01:24.729
 while they are still competing for wine 

00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:26.200
 example mandzukic that is seen 

00:01:24.729 --> 00:01:28.780
 used to playing in champions and this 

00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:32.180
 makes it natural to play this 

00:01:28.780 --> 00:01:34.790
 competition then that makes 

00:01:32.180 --> 00:01:37.250
 we sit strong to be able to compete 

00:01:34.790 --> 00:01:39.560
 By having more experience you do not buy 

00:01:37.250 --> 00:01:41.330
 experience is clear not with the 

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:42.890
 experience only you do not win because 

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:44.000
 there is a bear suisse and purple the champions 

00:01:42.890 --> 00:01:45.860
 last year would have been our 

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:48.140
 first champions with this group after 

00:01:45.860 --> 00:01:50.270
 of many years but it is clear that it gives you 

00:01:48.140 --> 00:01:51.470
 safety and security 

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:53.450
 more security players have 

00:01:51.470 --> 00:01:55.070
 individually better play 

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:57.979
 collectively better know the 

00:01:55.070 --> 00:02:00.290
 scenarios are better developed and good 

00:01:57.979 --> 00:02:03.260
 will be in us to transmit them of 

00:02:00.290 --> 00:02:04.970
 outside that tranquility so they can 

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:06.500
 better reason of the general as as 

00:02:04.970 --> 00:02:10.340
 coach not only have you got 

00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:12.590
 one the function of helping and raising a 

00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:14.450
 little and give ideas that can 

00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:17.000
 party can go logically once to the 

00:02:14.450 --> 00:02:20.110
 match how good is a theme 

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:21.910
 that is involved that in addition 

00:02:20.110 --> 00:02:25.060
 encourages the love to always be behind 

00:02:21.910 --> 00:02:27.280
 of the team to what extent your mission already 

00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:29.220
 is done once the referee whistles pita 

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:31.390
 At the start of the game, I think that 

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:34.270
 the coach has a participation 

00:02:31.390 --> 00:02:36.580
 important of the election and of 

00:02:34.270 --> 00:02:38.830
 transmit to the soccer player what is the 

00:02:36.580 --> 00:02:40.360
 idea of the football match had a 

00:02:38.830 --> 00:02:42.280
 coach that told us I accommodated them 

00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:44.110
 very well then it starts and that is 

00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:46.570
 Solve because it's a soccer game 

00:02:44.110 --> 00:02:47.860
 then it is clear that one the 

00:02:46.570 --> 00:02:49.390
 coaches we have a lot of them 

00:02:47.860 --> 00:02:51.250
 I think what power us 

00:02:49.390 --> 00:02:51.940
 coaches have big 

00:02:51.250 --> 00:02:53.740
 football players 

00:02:51.940 --> 00:02:55.150
 then better players to better 

00:02:53.740 --> 00:02:57.520
 soccer players understand 

00:02:55.150 --> 00:02:59.770
 better react to the idea of 

00:02:57.520 --> 00:03:01.209
 coach and they lower it in the best 

00:02:59.770 --> 00:03:03.280
 expression for a coach does not usually 

00:03:01.209 --> 00:03:04.959
 go through many times because it's not easy 

00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:07.209
 find footballers with so much 

00:03:04.959 --> 00:03:09.070
 ability to interpret many things 

00:03:07.209 --> 00:03:12.270
 but obviously there are better 

00:03:09.070 --> 00:03:15.530
 footballers who interpret the game 

00:03:12.270 --> 00:03:15.530
 best trainers
