00:00:56.319 --> 00:00:56.329 
insects in in the US and the sting is

00:00:56.329 --> 00:00:59.020 
insects in in the US and the sting is
very<00:00:56.870> ephemeral<00:00:57.320> it<00:00:57.649> lasts<00:00:58.160> two<00:00:58.699> to<00:00:58.730> three

00:00:59.020 --> 00:00:59.030 
very ephemeral it lasts two to three

very ephemeral it lasts two to three
minutes<00:00:59.360> and<00:00:59.510> it's<00:00:59.750> gone<00:01:00.110> and<00:01:00.530> so<00:01:00.760> then<00:01:01.760> the

00:01:01.840 --> 00:01:01.850 
minutes and it's gone and so then the

00:01:01.850 --> 00:01:04.090 
minutes and it's gone and so then the
question<00:01:02.000> is<00:01:02.449> what<00:01:03.110> chemically

00:01:04.090 --> 00:01:04.100 
question is what chemically

biochemically<00:01:04.970> is<00:01:05.180> in<00:01:05.449> the<00:01:05.570> venom<00:01:05.930> that<00:01:06.110> makes

00:01:06.580 --> 00:01:06.590 
biochemically is in the venom that makes

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:09.700 
biochemically is in the venom that makes
it<00:01:06.800> work<00:01:07.100> so<00:01:07.369> that<00:01:07.880> it<00:01:08.000> hurts<00:01:08.330> but<00:01:09.020> goes<00:01:09.259> away

00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:09.710 
it work so that it hurts but goes away
