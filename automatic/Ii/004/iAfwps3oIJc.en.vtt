00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:10.679

00:00:10.679 --> 00:00:15.690

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:16.890
 but I have a few again 

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:18.690
 announcement 

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:22.980
 I still have not got around to it 

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:25.740
 is just too lazy around all the old ones 

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:27.560
 Gameplay, so to speak, of my old pc 

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:29.869
 now to pull over on my new one 

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:32.399
 I still had the scold sign 

00:00:29.869 --> 00:00:35.489
 won round was the way goes 

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:37.260
 also ten minutes, so to speak by the 

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:41.550
 is won over time that is one 

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:43.230
 very interesting gameplay and yes that 

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:44.520
 I have so far not yet had thus 

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:45.899
 So far, I do not mind 

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:48.660
 so you can see the look times also 

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:51.570
 understand so maybe you hear 

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:53.100
 now then so is the headset 

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:53.879

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:56.730

00:00:53.879 --> 00:00:57.960
 the live commented despite again 

00:00:56.730 --> 00:00:59.430
 made that with the turtle beach 

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:00.770
 I now just brought so because I from 

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:04.080
 my age is not right anymore 

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:05.519
 could sound decent sound and 

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:08.400
 That's why I have something new again 

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:12.030
 I think I got that pretty well 

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:14.909
 so and from the sound quali should that 

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:16.650
 By the way, everything is so clear 

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:18.030
 I in the streams I will come soon 

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:21.450

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:45.540

00:01:43.079 --> 00:01:48.509

 I had connections to turtle beach 

00:01:54.299 --> 00:01:59.310

 advertising for this product yes 

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:09.149

00:02:07.469 --> 00:02:10.020
 do this play sound can be 

00:02:09.149 --> 00:02:12.090
 really cool 

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:13.170
 yes the so a small ads to case because 

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:16.620
 the house has climbed 

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:17.340
 I did not hear, that was a bit 

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:19.110
 been sad 

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:21.180
 but ok, now come to one 

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:23.190
 more exciting topic and indeed I have 

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:25.140
 a new pc I have now 70 times 

00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:27.090
 or so it should always be 

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:29.610
 mention it again and it will now 

00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:31.200
 regularly or often times give streams 

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:33.959
 the streams are actually in whole 

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:38.010
 good quality so that's actually 

00:02:33.959 --> 00:02:40.980
 to look so good in my eyes 

00:02:38.010 --> 00:02:43.709
 in principle that is now no 720p hd 

00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:46.430
 streams without the monument also logical 

00:02:43.709 --> 00:02:49.050
 but it was not it's not a bad one 

00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:52.080
 quality no bad graphics as such 

00:02:49.050 --> 00:02:53.130
 I would appreciate 84 b and so me 

00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:59.940
 I really believe in them too 

00:02:53.130 --> 00:03:02.850
 500 or 600 kb per second or so a 

00:02:59.940 --> 00:03:04.590
 I had no idea what that bird had before me 

00:03:02.850 --> 00:03:05.819
 At least you should not know 

00:03:04.590 --> 00:03:06.930
 often times stop by the streams 

00:03:05.819 --> 00:03:09.290
 are really pretty good 

00:03:06.930 --> 00:03:11.760
 it is mainly played with 2 

00:03:09.290 --> 00:03:13.799
 So that's how you get there 

00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:15.420
 the wish comes in I'd say would 

00:03:13.799 --> 00:03:17.220
 Of course twitch partners are also trying 

00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:17.670
 I think it's logical 

00:03:17.220 --> 00:03:18.930
 me 

00:03:17.670 --> 00:03:20.850
 Incidentally, I think a bit 

00:03:18.930 --> 00:03:22.079
 outrageous of panic arrogance that he 

00:03:20.850 --> 00:03:25.079
 At that time he was somehow the money-horny 

00:03:22.079 --> 00:03:29.100
 or that's not the case, of course 

00:03:25.079 --> 00:03:30.690
 me and as I said, looks in any case 

00:03:29.100 --> 00:03:33.239
 times before that, I left the link in 

00:03:30.690 --> 00:03:34.410
 the description on my facebook 

00:03:33.239 --> 00:03:35.940
 page I will announce again and again 

00:03:34.410 --> 00:03:36.680
 By the way, that's just for the record 

00:03:35.940 --> 00:03:41.160
 to mention 

00:03:36.680 --> 00:03:42.450
 So yes, what did I want to say now? 

00:03:41.160 --> 00:03:44.489
 exactly on my facebook page values 

00:03:42.450 --> 00:03:46.590
 I often announce this was not rime 

00:03:44.489 --> 00:03:49.799
 and the streams are always one 

00:03:46.590 --> 00:03:51.450
 about an hour and are actually one 

00:03:49.799 --> 00:03:52.590
 my eyes also quite interesting that 

00:03:51.450 --> 00:03:53.940
 of course I have tried one 

00:03:52.590 --> 00:03:56.579
 nice last kills are nice 

00:03:53.940 --> 00:03:59.130
 Wolbeck or something and then unfortunately have 

00:03:56.579 --> 00:04:01.260
 God can not do it, I hope that 

00:03:59.130 --> 00:04:02.370
 still okay for you as I said 

00:04:01.260 --> 00:04:05.519
 definitely look at the 

00:04:02.370 --> 00:04:08.000
 facebook page before that at the streams the 

00:04:05.519 --> 00:04:10.829
 Teams are also called video so to speak 

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:11.880
 saved so you can get it in 

00:04:10.829 --> 00:04:12.959
 after all, instead of that means when 

00:04:11.880 --> 00:04:14.730
 missed the game you can 

00:04:12.959 --> 00:04:17.370
 Nevertheless, go to the side and you 

00:04:14.730 --> 00:04:18.930
 to watch what was played 

00:04:17.370 --> 00:04:20.220
 yes I hope that little video 

00:04:18.930 --> 00:04:21.660
 Failed if yes then there is also in the 

00:04:20.220 --> 00:04:22.920
 thumbs up and 

00:04:21.660 --> 00:04:24.000
 in the next video it will be a few more 

00:04:22.920 --> 00:04:25.650
 Above all, information is too 

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:28.920
 battlefield 3 will eventually 

00:04:25.650 --> 00:04:31.280
 will soon give gameplays pure skin 

00:04:28.920 --> 00:04:31.280
 Zschau
