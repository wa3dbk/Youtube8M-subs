 open apart is the release of free 

00:01:21.820 --> 00:01:25.860

00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:59.130
 look for something positive in this match 

00:01:52.980 --> 00:01:59.130
 Here, the captain, Íñigo López, touched the goal 

00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:03.760

 and eye on this action because here it seemed 

00:02:19.959 --> 00:02:24.189
 that I was already complicating the thing 

00:02:21.849 --> 00:02:26.290
 definitive form to the local set 

00:02:24.189 --> 00:02:28.659

 the grenade he had made 

00:02:34.750 --> 00:02:42.090
 movements in the tactical aspect had 

00:02:39.670 --> 00:02:44.500
 entered Ortiz had also entered 

00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:46.660
 odion ighalo had entered brayan 

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:48.280
 Angle movements for 

00:02:46.660 --> 00:02:49.810
 try to change the luck of your team 

00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:52.030
 he stayed with ten he seemed to be 

00:02:49.810 --> 00:02:52.740
 all lost but appeared exceeds the 

00:02:52.030 --> 00:02:55.640
 lifetime 

00:02:52.740 --> 00:02:55.640
 to discount 

00:02:56.319 --> 00:02:59.709
 orellana on that corner kick and 

00:02:57.849 --> 00:03:02.019
 head-butt in parabola of the arabi that 

00:02:59.709 --> 00:03:05.579
 gave the grenade a quarter of an hour 

00:03:02.019 --> 00:03:05.579
 to try to tackle the comeback 

00:03:15.960 --> 00:03:20.370
 the match broke the match opened 

00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:22.140
 and he had occasions of both pomegranates 

00:03:20.370 --> 00:03:23.970
 to mark the 2 to 2 as the zaragoza 

00:03:22.140 --> 00:03:26.580
 to sentence the game very clear 

00:03:23.970 --> 00:03:27.990
 it is inter-postiga that he had the support 

00:03:26.580 --> 00:03:30.510
 to the help of víctor rodríguez but 

00:03:27.990 --> 00:03:32.340
 prefers to define alone and ends 

00:03:30.510 --> 00:03:34.620
 sending the ball outside appears 

00:03:32.340 --> 00:03:36.210
 providential a defender appears with 

00:03:34.620 --> 00:03:40.320
 Juan Ortiz evidence to divert the 

00:03:36.210 --> 00:03:42.030
 beating of helder postiga finished the clash 

00:03:40.320 --> 00:03:44.160
 with only coach in the technical zone 

00:03:42.030 --> 00:03:47.900
 manolo jiménez was ejected by 

00:03:44.160 --> 00:03:47.900
 protest the signaling of a fault 

00:03:51.180 --> 00:03:56.760
 and already in the final stretch the best of 

00:03:53.400 --> 00:03:58.769
 party was this the best of the outcome 

00:03:56.760 --> 00:04:00.090
 of the shock was this very long volleyball 

00:03:58.769 --> 00:04:02.909
 Borja Gomez who was about to 

00:04:00.090 --> 00:04:04.859
 sneak in the reaction of Roberto 

00:04:02.909 --> 00:04:06.569
 to avoid what could have been the 

00:04:04.859 --> 00:04:08.819
 goal of the day and who knows if the goal 

00:04:06.569 --> 00:04:10.739
 of the league 

00:04:08.819 --> 00:04:13.079
 that borja throw was the best of 

00:04:10.739 --> 00:04:13.739
 the final stretch won Zaragoza in the 

00:04:13.079 --> 00:04:17.120
