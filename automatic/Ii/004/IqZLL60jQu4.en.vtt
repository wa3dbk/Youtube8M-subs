Photoshop<00:00:04.500> here<00:00:04.680> the<00:00:04.830> first<00:00:05.130> thing<00:00:05.279> we<00:00:05.370> want

00:00:05.539 --> 00:00:05.549 
Photoshop here the first thing we want

00:00:05.549 --> 00:00:07.430 
Photoshop here the first thing we want
to<00:00:05.580> do<00:00:05.759> is<00:00:06.000> open<00:00:06.180> up<00:00:06.359> a<00:00:06.540> photo<00:00:06.899> to<00:00:07.080> work<00:00:07.230> with

00:00:07.430 --> 00:00:07.440 
to do is open up a photo to work with

00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:10.040 
to do is open up a photo to work with
now<00:00:08.340> it's<00:00:08.610> important<00:00:09.000> that<00:00:09.030> your<00:00:09.300> layer<00:00:09.570> looks

00:00:10.040 --> 00:00:10.050 
now it's important that your layer looks

00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:12.110 
now it's important that your layer looks
like<00:00:10.200> this<00:00:10.500> that<00:00:11.099> it's<00:00:11.250> set<00:00:11.460> as<00:00:11.580> a<00:00:11.610> background

00:00:12.110 --> 00:00:12.120 
like this that it's set as a background

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:14.870 
like this that it's set as a background
layer<00:00:12.269> if<00:00:13.019> you<00:00:13.080> open<00:00:13.740> up<00:00:13.769> your<00:00:13.889> photo<00:00:14.219> and<00:00:14.700> it's

00:00:14.870 --> 00:00:14.880 
layer if you open up your photo and it's

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:17.720 
layer if you open up your photo and it's
called<00:00:15.289> something<00:00:16.289> and<00:00:16.529> it's<00:00:16.770> not<00:00:16.859> locked

00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:17.730 
called something and it's not locked

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:19.990 
called something and it's not locked
not<00:00:18.180> set<00:00:18.359> as<00:00:18.449> background<00:00:18.480> layer<00:00:18.990> to<00:00:19.020> do<00:00:19.289> that

00:00:19.990 --> 00:00:20.000 
not set as background layer to do that

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:24.349 
not set as background layer to do that
cycle<00:00:21.000> a<00:00:21.090> go<00:00:21.390> to<00:00:21.449> layer<00:00:21.750> new<00:00:22.789> background<00:00:23.789> layer

00:00:24.349 --> 00:00:24.359 
cycle a go to layer new background layer

00:00:24.359 --> 00:00:26.630 
cycle a go to layer new background layer
and<00:00:24.570> we'll<00:00:25.380> convert<00:00:25.800> it<00:00:25.949> to<00:00:25.980> the<00:00:26.279> background

00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:26.640 
and we'll convert it to the background

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:28.970 
and we'll convert it to the background
layer<00:00:26.730> so<00:00:27.689> next<00:00:28.080> up<00:00:28.289> we<00:00:28.439> want<00:00:28.619> to<00:00:28.650> load<00:00:28.830> the

00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:28.980 
layer so next up we want to load the

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:31.460 
layer so next up we want to load the
action<00:00:29.340> so<00:00:29.699> we<00:00:29.880> go<00:00:30.000> the<00:00:30.090> window<00:00:30.359> menu<00:00:30.539> get<00:00:31.289> our

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:11.030 
us to move move it into position so what
you<00:02:09.509> want<00:02:09.660> to<00:02:09.690> do<00:02:09.810> is<00:02:09.989> basically<00:02:10.350> move<00:02:10.830> this

00:02:11.030 --> 00:02:11.040 
you want to do is basically move this

00:02:11.040 --> 00:02:13.070 
you want to do is basically move this
texture<00:02:11.459> over<00:02:11.880> the<00:02:11.910> area<00:02:12.390> that<00:02:12.510> you<00:02:12.570> painted

00:02:13.070 --> 00:02:13.080 
texture over the area that you painted

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:16.970 
texture over the area that you painted
now<00:02:13.770> the<00:02:14.130> reason<00:02:14.459> why<00:02:14.580> I've<00:02:15.230> done<00:02:16.230> this<00:02:16.440> actual

00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:16.980 
now the reason why I've done this actual

00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:18.830 
now the reason why I've done this actual
of<00:02:17.040> textures<00:02:17.550> is<00:02:17.790> it<00:02:17.940> because<00:02:18.450> you<00:02:18.540> can<00:02:18.660> get<00:02:18.780> a

00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:18.840 
of textures is it because you can get a

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:21.260 
of textures is it because you can get a
lot<00:02:19.140> of<00:02:19.230> different<00:02:19.530> results<00:02:19.920> so<00:02:19.950> if<00:02:20.220> I<00:02:20.400> you

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:21.270 
lot of different results so if I you

00:02:21.270 --> 00:02:23.240 
lot of different results so if I you
know<00:02:21.390> if<00:02:21.540> I<00:02:21.720> leave<00:02:22.380> it<00:02:22.410> like<00:02:22.650> that<00:02:22.680> I'll<00:02:23.040> get<00:02:23.190> a

00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:23.250 
know if I leave it like that I'll get a

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:25.250 
know if I leave it like that I'll get a
result<00:02:23.580> if<00:02:23.700> I<00:02:23.790> rotate<00:02:24.300> it<00:02:24.330> a<00:02:24.480> little<00:02:24.510> bit<00:02:24.810> that

00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:25.260 
result if I rotate it a little bit that

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:26.930 
result if I rotate it a little bit that
would<00:02:25.320> be<00:02:25.440> another<00:02:25.620> result<00:02:26.040> that<00:02:26.760> would<00:02:26.850> be

00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:26.940 
would be another result that would be

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:28.699 
would be another result that would be
another<00:02:27.120> that<00:02:27.540> would<00:02:27.630> be<00:02:27.720> another<00:02:27.959> you<00:02:28.590> know

00:02:28.699 --> 00:02:28.709 
another that would be another you know

00:02:28.709 --> 00:02:30.800 
another that would be another you know
if<00:02:28.800> I<00:02:28.890> scale<00:02:29.190> it<00:02:29.220> up<00:02:29.430> that'll<00:02:30.270> be<00:02:30.360> different

00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:30.810 
if I scale it up that'll be different

00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:32.780 
if I scale it up that'll be different
result<00:02:31.260> so<00:02:31.770> you<00:02:31.830> can<00:02:31.950> get<00:02:32.070> lots<00:02:32.370> and<00:02:32.520> lots<00:02:32.700> of

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:32.790 
result so you can get lots and lots of

00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:36.050 
result so you can get lots and lots of
different<00:02:33.030> results<00:02:33.420> so<00:02:33.980> just<00:02:34.980> experiment<00:02:35.370> you

00:02:36.050 --> 00:02:36.060 
different results so just experiment you

00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:39.830 
different results so just experiment you
know<00:02:36.180> if<00:02:36.299> you<00:02:36.360> run<00:02:36.510> this<00:02:36.600> action<00:02:37.110> and<00:02:38.810> you<00:02:39.810> know

00:02:39.830 --> 00:02:39.840 
know if you run this action and you know

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:41.509 
know if you run this action and you know
you're<00:02:40.049> not<00:02:40.110> you<00:02:40.830> can<00:02:41.160> get<00:02:41.280> better<00:02:41.430> results

00:02:41.509 --> 00:02:41.519 
you're not you can get better results

00:02:41.519 --> 00:02:43.539 
you're not you can get better results
and<00:02:42.060> just<00:02:42.360> try<00:02:42.630> using<00:02:42.780> a<00:02:42.930> different<00:02:43.230> texture

00:02:43.539 --> 00:02:43.549 
and just try using a different texture

00:02:43.549 --> 00:02:45.800 
and just try using a different texture
adjust<00:02:44.549> seeing<00:02:44.760> the<00:02:44.910> scale<00:02:45.180> rotate<00:02:45.690> it

00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:45.810 
adjust seeing the scale rotate it

00:02:45.810 --> 00:02:47.900 
adjust seeing the scale rotate it
whatever<00:02:46.049> so<00:02:46.620> when<00:02:46.980> we've<00:02:47.130> done<00:02:47.160> that<00:02:47.489> just

00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:47.910 
whatever so when we've done that just

00:02:47.910 --> 00:02:51.170 
whatever so when we've done that just
hit<00:02:48.540> enter<00:02:49.220> the<00:02:50.220> action<00:02:50.489> would<00:02:50.610> continue<00:02:51.150> to

00:02:51.170 --> 00:02:51.180 
hit enter the action would continue to

00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:53.600 
hit enter the action would continue to
play<00:02:51.510> the<00:02:52.019> action<00:02:52.230> will<00:02:52.380> take<00:02:52.560> about<00:02:52.709> 30<00:02:53.130> to<00:02:53.280> 40

00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:53.610 
play the action will take about 30 to 40

00:02:53.610 --> 00:02:55.070 
play the action will take about 30 to 40
seconds<00:02:54.000> from<00:02:54.120> here<00:02:54.330> so<00:02:54.630> I'm<00:02:54.810> just<00:02:54.900> going<00:02:55.049> to

00:02:55.070 --> 00:02:55.080 
seconds from here so I'm just going to

00:02:55.080 --> 00:02:57.460 
seconds from here so I'm just going to
fast<00:02:55.350> for<00:02:55.560> the<00:02:55.680> video<00:02:55.920> to<00:02:56.820> get<00:02:56.910> to<00:02:57.030> the<00:02:57.120> result

00:02:57.460 --> 00:02:57.470 
fast for the video to get to the result

00:02:57.470 --> 00:03:00.500 
fast for the video to get to the result
so<00:02:58.470> here's<00:02:58.830> our<00:02:58.980> result<00:02:59.370> now<00:02:59.910> we'll<00:03:00.330> just

00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:00.510 
so here's our result now we'll just

00:03:00.510 --> 00:03:02.479 
so here's our result now we'll just
close<00:03:00.750> the<00:03:00.930> actions<00:03:01.230> panel<00:03:01.410> and<00:03:01.769> take<00:03:02.310> a<00:03:02.340> look

00:03:02.479 --> 00:03:02.489 
close the actions panel and take a look

00:03:02.489 --> 00:03:03.949 
close the actions panel and take a look
at<00:03:02.549> the<00:03:02.760> action<00:03:03.030> to<00:03:03.180> code<00:03:03.390> it<00:03:03.510> for<00:03:03.690> us

00:03:03.949 --> 00:03:03.959 
at the action to code it for us

00:03:03.959 --> 00:03:06.229 
at the action to code it for us
so<00:03:04.590> we<00:03:04.709> have<00:03:04.799> the<00:03:04.920> shadow<00:03:05.220> parts<00:03:05.549> folder<00:03:05.970> you

00:03:06.229 --> 00:03:06.239 
so we have the shadow parts folder you

00:03:06.239 --> 00:03:09.140 
so we have the shadow parts folder you
turn<00:03:06.480> that<00:03:06.600> on<00:03:06.810> and<00:03:06.840> off<00:03:07.400> so<00:03:08.400> that<00:03:08.430> all<00:03:08.670> has<00:03:09.000> all

00:03:09.140 --> 00:03:09.150 
turn that on and off so that all has all

00:03:09.150 --> 00:03:11.330 
turn that on and off so that all has all
the<00:03:09.269> pieces<00:03:09.390> inside<00:03:09.739> so<00:03:10.739> you'll<00:03:11.040> notice<00:03:11.220> that

00:03:11.330 --> 00:03:11.340 
the pieces inside so you'll notice that

00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:14.150 
the pieces inside so you'll notice that
the<00:03:11.430> the<00:03:11.970> folder<00:03:12.329> has<00:03:12.420> a<00:03:12.480> layer<00:03:12.750> mask<00:03:13.160> folding

00:03:14.150 --> 00:03:14.160 
the the folder has a layer mask folding

00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:16.569 
the the folder has a layer mask folding
mask<00:03:14.280> so<00:03:14.519> if<00:03:14.700> I<00:03:14.850> just<00:03:15.030> got<00:03:15.180> a<00:03:15.209> white<00:03:15.540> brush<00:03:15.900> and

00:03:16.569 --> 00:03:16.579 
mask so if I just got a white brush and

00:03:16.579 --> 00:03:19.039 
mask so if I just got a white brush and
brush<00:03:17.579> into<00:03:17.760> this<00:03:18.000> mask<00:03:18.299> you<00:03:18.630> know<00:03:18.720> you<00:03:18.930> can

00:03:19.039 --> 00:03:19.049 
brush into this mask you know you can

00:03:19.049 --> 00:03:25.220 
brush into this mask you know you can
just<00:03:19.200> erase<00:03:22.670> erase<00:03:23.670> some<00:03:24.540> shadow<00:03:24.810> parts<00:03:25.110> if

00:03:25.220 --> 00:03:25.230 
just erase erase some shadow parts if

00:03:25.230 --> 00:03:28.340 
just erase erase some shadow parts if
you<00:03:25.290> don't<00:03:25.440> want<00:03:25.590> them<00:03:25.739> so<00:03:26.370> that's<00:03:27.269> that<00:03:27.570> label

00:03:28.340 --> 00:03:28.350 
you don't want them so that's that label

00:03:28.350 --> 00:03:30.620 
you don't want them so that's that label
load<00:03:28.579> contrast<00:03:29.579> if<00:03:29.910> you<00:03:30.090> double<00:03:30.390> click<00:03:30.420> on

00:03:30.620 --> 00:03:30.630 
load contrast if you double click on

00:03:30.630 --> 00:03:35.030 
load contrast if you double click on
this<00:03:30.810> you<00:03:31.110> can<00:03:31.610> adjust<00:03:32.610> the<00:03:32.730> brightness

00:03:35.030 --> 00:03:35.040 

00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:42.600 

of<00:03:36.040> the<00:03:36.310> shadow<00:03:36.760> parts<00:03:38.400> like<00:03:39.400> that<00:03:41.340> it<00:03:42.340> lays

00:03:42.600 --> 00:03:42.610 
of the shadow parts like that it lays

00:03:42.610 --> 00:03:45.630 
of the shadow parts like that it lays
below<00:03:43.030> these<00:03:43.830> these<00:03:44.830> layers<00:03:45.100> here<00:03:45.400> they're

00:03:45.630 --> 00:03:45.640 
below these these layers here they're

00:03:45.640 --> 00:03:48.510 
below these these layers here they're
all<00:03:45.790> the<00:03:45.940> individual<00:03:47.010> shadow<00:03:48.010> part<00:03:48.310> so<00:03:48.460> you

00:03:48.510 --> 00:03:48.520 
all the individual shadow part so you

00:03:48.520 --> 00:03:52.470 
all the individual shadow part so you
can<00:03:48.700> move<00:03:48.970> them<00:03:49.180> around<00:03:49.210> if<00:03:49.660> you<00:03:49.780> want<00:03:51.360> you<00:03:52.360> can

00:03:52.470 --> 00:03:52.480 
can move them around if you want you can

00:03:52.480 --> 00:03:53.820 
can move them around if you want you can
also<00:03:52.630> duplicate<00:03:53.200> and<00:03:53.350> then<00:03:53.380> you<00:03:53.530> can<00:03:53.680> do

00:03:53.820 --> 00:03:53.830 
also duplicate and then you can do

00:03:53.830 --> 00:03:55.199 
also duplicate and then you can do
Patten<00:03:54.130> entire<00:03:54.400> folder<00:03:54.850> if<00:03:54.910> you<00:03:54.970> want<00:03:55.030> to

00:03:55.199 --> 00:03:55.209 
Patten entire folder if you want to

00:03:55.209 --> 00:03:57.060 
Patten entire folder if you want to
create<00:03:55.390> little<00:03:55.510> parts<00:03:55.900> so<00:03:56.680> you<00:03:56.709> know<00:03:56.860> if<00:03:57.010> I

00:03:57.060 --> 00:03:57.070 
create little parts so you know if I

00:03:57.070 --> 00:04:00.900 
create little parts so you know if I
just<00:03:57.310> click<00:03:57.910> these<00:03:58.150> drag<00:03:59.080> them<00:03:59.260> out<00:03:59.700> I've<00:04:00.700> got

00:04:00.900 --> 00:04:00.910 
just click these drag them out I've got

00:04:00.910 --> 00:04:05.160 
just click these drag them out I've got
a<00:04:00.940> lot<00:04:01.090> more<00:04:01.120> parts<00:04:01.630> ready<00:04:01.900> to<00:04:01.990> go<00:04:04.140> okay<00:04:05.140> so

00:04:05.160 --> 00:04:05.170 
a lot more parts ready to go okay so

00:04:05.170 --> 00:04:06.990 
a lot more parts ready to go okay so
that's<00:04:05.530> all<00:04:05.800> there<00:04:05.890> is<00:04:05.980> to<00:04:06.220> it

00:04:06.990 --> 00:04:07.000 
that's all there is to it

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:09.199 
that's all there is to it
I<00:04:07.060> just<00:04:07.720> quit<00:04:07.840> in<00:04:07.989> these<00:04:08.110> bottom<00:04:08.470> three<00:04:08.500> ones

00:04:25.380 --> 00:04:25.390 
really all there is to the shadow action

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:36.010 
the action panel I've set up this

00:04:36.010 --> 00:04:37.740 
the action panel I've set up this
actually<00:04:36.340> called<00:04:36.520> graded<00:04:36.940> now<00:04:37.480> what<00:04:37.630> this

00:04:37.740 --> 00:04:37.750 
actually called graded now what this

00:04:37.750 --> 00:04:40.920 
actually called graded now what this
will<00:04:38.320> basically<00:04:38.530> do<00:04:38.979> is<00:04:39.220> flatten<00:04:39.690> all<00:04:40.690> our

00:04:40.920 --> 00:04:40.930 
will basically do is flatten all our

00:04:40.930 --> 00:04:42.810 
will basically do is flatten all our
layers<00:04:41.110> and<00:04:41.560> it<00:04:42.310> will<00:04:42.400> add<00:04:42.490> a<00:04:42.520> lot<00:04:42.760> more

00:04:42.810 --> 00:04:42.820 
layers and it will add a lot more

00:04:42.820 --> 00:04:45.420 
layers and it will add a lot more
contrast<00:04:43.810> to<00:04:44.200> our<00:04:44.290> photo<00:04:44.530> and<00:04:44.860> sharpen<00:04:45.340> the

00:04:45.420 --> 00:04:45.430 
contrast to our photo and sharpen the

00:04:45.430 --> 00:04:47.790 
contrast to our photo and sharpen the
detail<00:04:45.820> so<00:04:46.120> to<00:04:46.180> make<00:04:46.360> everything<00:04:46.690> pop<00:04:47.050> a<00:04:47.290> lot

00:04:47.790 --> 00:04:47.800 
detail so to make everything pop a lot

00:04:47.800 --> 00:04:50.130 
detail so to make everything pop a lot
more<00:04:48.040> so<00:04:48.580> let's<00:04:49.180> go<00:04:49.300> ahead<00:04:49.360> and<00:04:49.540> do<00:04:49.600> that<00:04:49.750> so

00:04:50.130 --> 00:04:50.140 
more so let's go ahead and do that so

00:04:50.140 --> 00:04:57.629 
more so let's go ahead and do that so
just<00:04:50.169> slick<00:04:50.680> write<00:04:50.919> it<00:04:51.040> and<00:04:51.160> play

00:04:57.629 --> 00:04:57.639 

00:04:57.639 --> 00:05:00.029 

so<00:04:58.270> you<00:04:58.330> can<00:04:58.509> see<00:04:58.659> what<00:04:58.780> it's<00:04:58.900> done<00:04:59.080> now<00:04:59.710> if<00:04:59.949> I

00:05:00.029 --> 00:05:00.039 
so you can see what it's done now if I

00:05:00.039 --> 00:05:03.959 
so you can see what it's done now if I
just<00:05:00.099> zoom<00:05:00.280> on<00:05:00.550> zoom<00:05:01.000> in<00:05:01.180> range<00:05:02.110> here<00:05:02.379> and<00:05:02.969> so

00:05:03.959 --> 00:05:03.969 
just zoom on zoom in range here and so

00:05:03.969 --> 00:05:05.850 
just zoom on zoom in range here and so
you<00:05:04.030> see<00:05:04.449> the<00:05:04.719> main<00:05:04.840> layer<00:05:05.050> is<00:05:05.259> created<00:05:05.469> is

00:05:05.850 --> 00:05:05.860 
you see the main layer is created is

00:05:05.860 --> 00:05:08.520 
you see the main layer is created is
contrast<00:05:06.400> plus<00:05:06.699> sharpening<00:05:07.150> down<00:05:07.539> here<00:05:07.750> so<00:05:08.379> if

00:05:08.520 --> 00:05:08.530 
contrast plus sharpening down here so if

00:05:08.530 --> 00:05:13.050 
contrast plus sharpening down here so if
I<00:05:08.620> turn<00:05:08.680> this<00:05:08.949> on<00:05:09.099> and<00:05:09.280> off<00:05:11.849> you<00:05:12.849> can<00:05:12.879> really

00:05:13.050 --> 00:05:13.060 
I turn this on and off you can really

00:05:13.060 --> 00:05:16.230 
I turn this on and off you can really
see<00:05:13.449> the<00:05:13.569> difference<00:05:13.689> there<00:05:15.060> brings<00:05:16.060> out<00:05:16.210> a

00:05:16.230 --> 00:05:16.240 
see the difference there brings out a

00:05:16.240 --> 00:05:19.589 
see the difference there brings out a
lot<00:05:16.449> of<00:05:16.539> details<00:05:17.759> so<00:05:18.759> you<00:05:18.969> can<00:05:19.060> use<00:05:19.360> that<00:05:19.479> if

00:05:19.589 --> 00:05:19.599 
lot of details so you can use that if

00:05:19.599 --> 00:05:21.980 
lot of details so you can use that if
you<00:05:19.629> want<00:05:19.719> I've<00:05:20.229> also<00:05:20.439> set<00:05:21.129> up<00:05:21.159> in<00:05:21.340> the<00:05:21.430> action

00:05:21.980 --> 00:05:21.990 
you want I've also set up in the action

00:05:21.990 --> 00:05:25.110 
you want I've also set up in the action

00:05:25.110 --> 00:05:25.120 
10 color options so you can just flick

00:05:25.120 --> 00:05:29.520 
10 color options so you can just flick
these<00:05:25.770> layers<00:05:26.770> on<00:05:27.039> and<00:05:27.159> off<00:05:27.310> to<00:05:27.550> see<00:05:28.080> if<00:05:29.080> any<00:05:29.439> of

these layers on and off to see if any of

00:05:29.530 --> 00:05:32.640 
these layers on and off to see if any of
these<00:05:29.650> colors<00:05:30.960> see<00:05:31.960> what<00:05:32.169> you're<00:05:32.289> working<00:05:32.379> on
