 I tell you meeting list with 

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:15.059
 now more than a year of experience that 

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:17.730
 gathers students to live the 

00:00:15.059 --> 00:00:19.830
 dollar has reached 5 a completely 

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:22.710
 parity even more feminine than 

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:24.210
 masculine with people very much rooted in 

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:25.680
 the community is deeply 

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:28.019
 motivated to move the head 

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:30.539
 gold in a few words nine people on 

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:32.160
 is his name is already professional who 

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:35.430
 is a collective can pretty much 

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:37.320
 leading militants for the overwhelming 

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:39.750
 majority of beef and very trends 

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:43.050
 diverse but have a common ideal 

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:43.850
 for river and south students with whom we 

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:45.840
 work 

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:47.489
 specificity of our list is to be 

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:49.410
 sure everything is not because we want 

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:52.129
 do this year is to alternate the 

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:53.760
 Mans defends a new way once 

00:00:52.129 --> 00:00:55.110
 ten years is almost 

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:56.879
 revolutionary league drop and for 

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:57.570
 that's what we called the freedmen because 

00:00:56.879 --> 00:00:58.800
 what is it that today 

00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:00.449
 a rebel to sciences po lille 

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:01.800
 this afternoon but the trash the flag 

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:03.690
 red that loosens the kissing fist 

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:05.400
 red dead that puts a mega phone aside 

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:07.560
 So here we are to make you hear 

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:10.020
 a different voice to argue 

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:11.729
 our ideas are not sluts even though 

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:14.820
 sometimes consciousness on leaving the 

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:16.830
 theater breaks the most break what's this 

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:18.630
 the union action collective that that 

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:19.920
 the local in the local 

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:22.110
 when I think we still have not 

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:23.400
 too bad started the year we did a 

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:25.500
 campaign that worked pretty well 

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:26.400
 in particular on the increase of the costs 

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:28.460
 of registration you are three 

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:33.560
 strong proposals that you make 

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:33.560
 be they there are in fact three axes 

00:01:36.409 --> 00:01:42.340
 but since our measures measured 

00:01:39.049 --> 00:01:42.340
 I gave 3 

00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:49.990
 we are here to defend your ideas for 

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:49.990
 promote a new path 

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:56.869
 like me 

00:02:01.930 --> 00:02:08.899
 what will happen this reform 

00:02:04.610 --> 00:02:10.970
 she was made she was done quite 

00:02:08.899 --> 00:02:13.400
 quickly that is too fast and 

00:02:10.970 --> 00:02:14.630
 that she she is not enough 

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:16.880
 just to your senses 

00:02:14.630 --> 00:02:18.170
 the upper court who still see 

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:19.640
 plus the other teenagers so as to 

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:21.950
 what they are really the richest 

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:24.830
 really pay that this hinders so 

00:02:21.950 --> 00:02:26.900
 to the number of bearings are 

00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:29.239
 multiplied so as to smooth as much as possible 

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:30.319
 times more baskets more 

00:02:29.239 --> 00:02:32.120
 reform is just me there are some 

00:02:30.319 --> 00:02:34.280
 legal issues it's my life and the 

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:36.470
 commercialization of knowledge also omitted 

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:36.950
 of these proposals for the rating of 

00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:39.260
 plantations 

00:02:36.950 --> 00:02:42.019
 there was binder between and impulse 

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:46.070
 of the project we were going to embark on 

00:02:42.019 --> 00:02:48.110
 this rise is really a stage of 

00:02:46.070 --> 00:02:49.880
 barter project renaturer must the strict and 

00:02:48.110 --> 00:02:51.440
 water is a very tough match that this 

00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:53.390
 either for a public school so 

00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:55.640
 obviously seeing there a ceiling on the 

00:02:53.390 --> 00:02:58.010
 maximum registration can apply 

00:02:55.640 --> 00:02:59.120
 and for the sake of social equity for 

00:02:58.010 --> 00:03:01.430
 his notes to have this category 

00:02:59.120 --> 00:03:03.290
 of students who are not scholars but 

00:03:01.430 --> 00:03:05.000
 who is at level 0 light above 

00:03:03.290 --> 00:03:07.489
 who will fold as much any inscription 

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:09.620
 that a widespread student and I have 

00:03:07.489 --> 00:03:14.750
 Parisian fact and that he will have the means 

00:03:09.620 --> 00:03:18.049
 reached 4.5 mutation that 

00:03:14.750 --> 00:03:20.209
 said in several stages degressive 

00:03:18.049 --> 00:03:22.190
 according to parents' income and 

00:03:20.209 --> 00:03:23.329
 the final position I think it is 

00:03:22.190 --> 00:03:25.190
 rather clear is that simply 

00:03:23.329 --> 00:03:26.209
 lease is already ripe the increase in 

00:03:25.190 --> 00:03:27.829
 French who put at three years 

00:03:26.209 --> 00:03:28.790
 now for us the increase of 

00:03:27.829 --> 00:03:31.040
 France I do not know a solution 

00:03:28.790 --> 00:03:32.570
 to fund our voted achievement heads 

00:03:31.040 --> 00:03:34.310
 by students who will get straightened 

00:03:32.570 --> 00:03:36.140
 head rather than raising the point these 

00:03:34.310 --> 00:03:38.480
 rooms a prophet and 1 second of 

00:03:36.140 --> 00:03:42.170
 against campaign does this is a slogan that 

00:03:38.480 --> 00:03:45.160
 refers to the opposing lisp for another 

00:03:42.170 --> 00:03:45.160
 reason 

00:03:49.170 --> 00:03:53.310
 I'm not sure it's a slogan 

00:03:50.990 --> 00:03:56.940
 proposal carrier 

00:03:53.310 --> 00:04:00.300
 I think it's a slogan that goes to 

00:03:56.940 --> 00:04:01.140
 contrary be source of age pub rather 

00:04:00.300 --> 00:04:03.450
 that of gathering 

00:04:01.140 --> 00:04:04.739
 the raised fist I can put that in 

00:04:03.450 --> 00:04:06.300
 these pleasures here I am going to get up 

00:04:04.739 --> 00:04:08.220
 is expected a delay all the time because 

00:04:06.300 --> 00:04:10.650
 that I love them and she has very 

00:04:08.220 --> 00:04:13.350
 frankly for you the one who do 

00:04:10.650 --> 00:04:18.870
 our pace I think that door 

00:04:13.350 --> 00:04:21.389
 the audoise association and what it 

00:04:18.870 --> 00:04:23.190
 must add the profits of spl tv for 

00:04:21.389 --> 00:04:24.840
 to do it there is that elections 

00:04:23.190 --> 00:04:27.450
 Board elections 

00:04:24.840 --> 00:04:29.070
 which are important because this day 

00:04:27.450 --> 00:04:31.080
 where these administrations elements 

00:04:29.070 --> 00:04:33.540
 strategic and you do not have to 

00:04:31.080 --> 00:04:35.930
 uninterested years went to vote even 

00:04:33.540 --> 00:04:39.540
 if it's better if you and for us 

00:04:35.930 --> 00:04:41.760
 here it is said if you really want 

00:04:39.540 --> 00:04:44.220
 not voted for us to witnesses in fact 

00:04:41.760 --> 00:04:45.990
 dare also redhead and at least moved 

00:04:44.220 --> 00:04:47.400
 you and make the gesture to go there 

00:04:45.990 --> 00:04:48.720
 problems of participation in this 

00:04:47.400 --> 00:04:50.040
 a policy that is still 

00:04:48.720 --> 00:04:51.150
 can should offer his parents can 

00:04:50.040 --> 00:04:55.020
 to be disgusted by all lists 

00:04:51.150 --> 00:04:57.210
 would not like to go back to the studio it's 

00:04:55.020 --> 00:04:57.600
 a little more hand in the focused by makes me 

00:04:57.210 --> 00:05:02.580
 a thing 

00:04:57.600 --> 00:05:04.680
 go ahead at least have action you in 

00:05:02.580 --> 00:05:07.680
 do not change allied to ps 

00:05:04.680 --> 00:05:11.730

00:05:11.730 --> 00:05:17.910
 second round of bids in the same 

00:05:16.200 --> 00:05:22.200
 hoof rhythm is that it would 

00:05:17.910 --> 00:05:25.800
 bad to mention it I can just say
