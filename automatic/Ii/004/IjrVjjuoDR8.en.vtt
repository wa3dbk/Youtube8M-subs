00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:07.480 
so the last thing we need to do now is

00:00:07.480 --> 00:00:09.900 
so the last thing we need to do now is
just<00:00:07.690> set<00:00:08.080> up<00:00:08.200> the<00:00:08.350> machine<00:00:08.700> we're<00:00:09.700> going<00:00:09.820> to

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:09.910 
just set up the machine we're going to

00:00:09.910 --> 00:00:13.230 
just set up the machine we're going to
set<00:00:10.180> the<00:00:10.540> center<00:00:11.530> position<00:00:11.980> provide<00:00:12.700> graving

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:13.240 
set the center position provide graving

00:00:13.240 --> 00:00:15.839 
set the center position provide graving
and<00:00:13.390> then<00:00:13.840> just<00:00:14.050> make<00:00:14.290> sure<00:00:14.320> that<00:00:15.040> the<00:00:15.460> machine

00:00:15.839 --> 00:00:15.849 
and then just make sure that the machine

00:00:15.849 --> 00:00:17.970 
and then just make sure that the machine
is<00:00:16.059> set<00:00:16.360> it<00:00:16.570> set<00:00:16.840> up<00:00:16.960> appropriately<00:00:17.349> for<00:00:17.860> the

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:17.980 
is set it set up appropriately for the

00:00:17.980 --> 00:00:21.240 
is set it set up appropriately for the
job<00:00:18.160> we're<00:00:18.310> doing<00:00:19.110> so<00:00:20.110> on<00:00:20.860> the<00:00:21.040> hand

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:21.250 
job we're doing so on the hand

00:00:21.250 --> 00:00:24.569 
job we're doing so on the hand
controller<00:00:22.710> I've<00:00:23.710> just<00:00:24.009> turned<00:00:24.189> the<00:00:24.310> machine

00:00:24.569 --> 00:00:24.579 
controller I've just turned the machine

00:00:24.579 --> 00:00:27.659 
controller I've just turned the machine
on<00:00:24.759> to<00:00:25.000> approach<00:00:25.329> says<00:00:25.630> hit<00:00:26.110> enter<00:00:26.500> let's<00:00:27.489> do

00:00:27.659 --> 00:00:27.669 
on to approach says hit enter let's do

00:00:27.669 --> 00:00:32.480 
on to approach says hit enter let's do
that

00:00:32.480 --> 00:00:32.490 

00:00:32.490 --> 00:00:34.790 

so<00:00:33.030> the<00:00:33.120> machine<00:00:33.450> is<00:00:33.600> now<00:00:33.750> moving<00:00:33.960> back<00:00:34.350> to<00:00:34.680> the

00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:34.800 
so the machine is now moving back to the

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:41.660 
so the machine is now moving back to the
three<00:00:35.040> limit<00:00:35.370> positions<00:00:38.690> okay<00:00:40.340> now<00:00:41.340> when<00:00:41.640> I

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:41.670 
three limit positions okay now when I

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:44.120 
three limit positions okay now when I
press<00:00:41.970> menu<00:00:42.600> it<00:00:42.750> toggles<00:00:43.050> through<00:00:43.590> all<00:00:43.830> the

00:00:46.550 --> 00:00:46.560 
different options that we have but I'm

00:00:46.560 --> 00:00:48.800 
different options that we have but I'm

order to change that the first thing I
need<00:01:51.180> to<00:01:51.210> do<00:01:51.560> is<00:01:52.560> set<00:01:52.830> it<00:01:52.860> to<00:01:53.040> go<00:01:53.070> to<00:01:53.220> y<00:01:53.550> 0<00:01:54.020> that's

00:01:55.010 --> 00:01:55.020 
need to do is set it to go to y 0 that's

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:57.860 
need to do is set it to go to y 0 that's
the<00:01:55.230> default<00:01:55.380> built<00:01:56.160> in<00:01:56.430> position<00:01:56.940> for<00:01:57.300> center

00:01:57.860 --> 00:01:57.870 
the default built in position for center

of<00:01:57.930> rotation<00:01:58.140> in<00:01:58.710> the<00:01:58.800> y<00:01:58.920> axis<00:02:00.380> then<00:02:01.380> i<00:02:01.620> can

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:01.950 
of rotation in the y axis then i can

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:06.650 
of rotation in the y axis then i can
press<00:02:02.160> X<00:02:02.940> Y<00:02:03.300> origin<00:02:04.140> set<00:02:05.240> and<00:02:06.240> then<00:02:06.360> I<00:02:06.420> can<00:02:06.630> move

00:02:06.650 --> 00:02:06.660 
press X Y origin set and then I can move

00:02:06.660 --> 00:02:10.669 
press X Y origin set and then I can move
the<00:02:07.229> head<00:02:07.380> in<00:02:07.530> the<00:02:07.620> machine<00:02:08.899> press<00:02:09.899> the<00:02:10.140> hair

00:02:10.679 --> 00:02:14.060 
the head in the machine press the hair
for<00:02:10.920> speed<00:02:11.510> until<00:02:12.510> the<00:02:12.690> laser<00:02:13.050> pointer<00:02:13.830> and

00:02:14.060 --> 00:02:14.070 
for speed until the laser pointer and

00:02:14.070 --> 00:02:15.410 
for speed until the laser pointer and
this<00:02:14.160> is<00:02:14.280> going<00:02:14.430> to<00:02:14.490> be<00:02:14.580> impossible<00:02:14.910> to<00:02:15.180> see

00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:15.420 
this is going to be impossible to see

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:20.060 
this is going to be impossible to see
the<00:02:15.630> laser<00:02:16.260> pointer<00:02:18.200> is<00:02:19.200> in<00:02:19.440> the<00:02:19.530> middle<00:02:19.920> of

00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:20.070 
the laser pointer is in the middle of

00:02:20.070 --> 00:02:22.970 
the laser pointer is in the middle of
the<00:02:20.220> area<00:02:20.760> I<00:02:20.790> want<00:02:21.060> to<00:02:21.209> engrave<00:02:21.650> that's<00:02:22.650> fine

00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:22.980 
the area I want to engrave that's fine

00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:27.440 
the area I want to engrave that's fine
for<00:02:23.010> me<00:02:23.959> so<00:02:24.959> if<00:02:25.620> i<00:02:25.709> just<00:02:25.920> press<00:02:26.160> enter<00:02:26.450> to

the<00:02:38.730> correct<00:02:38.940> place<00:02:39.270> to<00:02:39.660> engrave

00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:43.910 

00:02:43.910 --> 00:02:47.300 

just<00:02:44.910> going<00:02:45.060> to<00:02:45.120> lift<00:02:45.300> the<00:02:45.540> lid<00:02:45.720> now<00:02:46.310> you'll

00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:47.310 
just going to lift the lid now you'll

00:02:47.310 --> 00:02:49.910 
just going to lift the lid now you'll
see<00:02:47.400> that<00:02:47.910> the<00:02:48.240> the<00:02:49.110> glass<00:02:49.380> is<00:02:49.650> quite<00:02:49.890> a

00:02:49.910 --> 00:02:49.920 
see that the the glass is quite a

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:52.450 
see that the the glass is quite a
distance<00:02:50.280> from<00:02:50.820> the<00:02:51.390> bottom<00:02:51.690> of<00:02:51.780> the<00:02:51.840> spindle

00:02:52.450 --> 00:02:52.460 
distance from the bottom of the spindle

00:02:52.460 --> 00:02:55.250 
distance from the bottom of the spindle
so<00:02:53.460> using<00:02:53.850> the<00:02:53.910> bottom<00:02:54.180> lock<00:02:54.390> I'm<00:02:54.750> just<00:02:55.080> going

00:02:55.250 --> 00:02:55.260 
so using the bottom lock I'm just going

00:02:55.260 --> 00:02:59.270 
so using the bottom lock I'm just going
to<00:02:55.290> lift<00:02:55.650> that<00:02:55.950> up<00:02:56.010> now<00:02:57.680> so<00:02:58.680> it<00:02:58.800> comes<00:02:59.010> in<00:02:59.190> the

00:02:59.270 --> 00:02:59.280 
to lift that up now so it comes in the

00:02:59.280 --> 00:03:08.110 
to lift that up now so it comes in the
range<00:02:59.580> of<00:03:00.000> the<00:03:00.510> spindle<00:03:00.810> move<00:03:05.720> there<00:03:06.720> we<00:03:06.840> go

00:03:08.110 --> 00:03:08.120 
range of the spindle move there we go

00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:10.160 
range of the spindle move there we go
now<00:03:09.120> when<00:03:09.330> we're<00:03:09.450> doing<00:03:09.570> glass<00:03:09.900> engraving

00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:10.170 
now when we're doing glass engraving

00:03:10.170 --> 00:03:12.860 
now when we're doing glass engraving
it's<00:03:11.010> very<00:03:11.280> important<00:03:11.910> that<00:03:12.000> we<00:03:12.150> use<00:03:12.540> the

00:03:12.860 --> 00:03:12.870 
it's very important that we use the

00:03:12.870 --> 00:03:16.160 
it's very important that we use the
liquid<00:03:13.230> feed<00:03:13.650> system<00:03:14.570> so<00:03:15.570> on<00:03:15.630> the<00:03:15.780> side<00:03:16.020> and

00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:16.170 
liquid feed system so on the side and

00:03:16.170 --> 00:03:18.740 
liquid feed system so on the side and
machine<00:03:16.530> I'm<00:03:16.710> just<00:03:16.920> switching<00:03:17.910> the<00:03:18.090> the<00:03:18.480> pump
