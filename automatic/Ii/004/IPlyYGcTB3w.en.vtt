00:00:08.480 --> 00:00:08.490 
to understand negative calorie foods we

00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:10.279 
to understand negative calorie foods we
first<00:00:08.790> of<00:00:08.969> all<00:00:09.150> have<00:00:09.360> to<00:00:09.510> talk<00:00:09.719> about<00:00:09.750> what

happens when you eat food of course you

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:14.990 
happens when you eat food of course you
put<00:00:12.869> something<00:00:13.110> into<00:00:13.410> your<00:00:13.530> mouth<00:00:13.799> to<00:00:14.549> chew<00:00:14.580> it

put something into your mouth to chew it

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.350 
put something into your mouth to chew it
then<00:00:15.360> you<00:00:15.480> swallow<00:00:15.809> it<00:00:15.929> and<00:00:16.049> then<00:00:16.740> all<00:00:16.980> the

00:00:17.350 --> 00:00:17.360 
then you swallow it and then all the

00:00:17.360 --> 00:00:19.700 
then you swallow it and then all the
digesting<00:00:18.360> and<00:00:18.570> churning<00:00:19.050> in<00:00:19.200> your<00:00:19.380> gut

happens<00:00:20.189> and<00:00:20.400> all<00:00:20.610> that<00:00:20.820> of<00:00:20.970> course<00:00:21.240> costs<00:00:21.930> a

00:00:22.009 --> 00:00:22.019 
happens and all that of course costs a

00:00:22.019 --> 00:00:28.860 
happens and all that of course costs a
bit<00:00:22.170> of<00:00:22.410> energy

00:00:28.860 --> 00:00:28.870

and digesting and all that work that

00:01:14.140 --> 00:01:17.100 
and digesting and all that work that
takes<00:01:14.500> your<00:01:14.740> body<00:01:14.920> you<00:01:15.820> will<00:01:16.030> burn<00:01:16.270> more<00:01:16.780> than

those nine shells but there is something

00:01:20.740 --> 00:01:23.040 
those nine shells but there is something
very<00:01:21.100> simple<00:01:21.730> that<00:01:22.000> they<00:01:22.180> don't<00:01:22.480> take<00:01:22.810> into

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:23.050 
very simple that they don't take into

account when the amount of calories in
food<00:01:25.750> were<00:01:26.590> calculated<00:01:27.460> all<00:01:28.150> the<00:01:29.280> calories

they're<00:01:34.390> put<00:01:34.660> into<00:01:34.930> this<00:01:35.350> final<00:01:35.830> number<00:01:36.310> they

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:36.430 
they're put into this final number they

they're put into this final number they
already<00:01:36.760> were<00:01:37.410> subtracted<00:01:38.410> to<00:01:38.980> arrive<00:01:39.370> at<00:01:39.670> the

already were subtracted to arrive at the

nine Celt for example for the calorie so

00:01:43.390 --> 00:01:46.080 
nine Celt for example for the calorie so
what<00:01:43.570> they<00:01:43.720> try<00:01:44.080> to<00:01:44.110> do<00:01:44.470> is<00:01:44.710> a<00:01:45.130> double<00:01:45.610> negative

00:01:46.080 --> 00:01:46.090 
what they try to do is a double negative

00:01:46.090 --> 00:01:48.750 
what they try to do is a double negative
they<00:01:46.630> try<00:01:46.930> to<00:01:46.990> substract<00:01:47.770> something<00:01:48.460> once

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:48.760 
they try to substract something once

they try to substract something once
more<00:01:49.180> that<00:01:49.690> has<00:01:49.840> already<00:01:50.080> been<00:01:50.290> taken<00:01:50.620> care<00:01:51.010> of

00:01:57.250 --> 00:02:00.690 

now<00:01:57.940> of<00:01:58.330> course<00:01:58.750> some<00:01:59.410> people<00:01:59.470> say<00:02:00.040> I<00:02:00.220> started

00:02:00.690 --> 00:02:00.700 
now of course some people say I started

00:02:00.700 --> 00:02:02.580 
now of course some people say I started
eating<00:02:00.850> those<00:02:01.210> negative<00:02:01.630> calorie<00:02:01.960> foods<00:02:02.320> and

00:02:02.580 --> 00:02:02.590 
eating those negative calorie foods and

00:02:02.590 --> 00:02:05.790 
eating those negative calorie foods and
at<00:02:03.370> lost<00:02:03.580> weight<00:02:03.850> how<00:02:04.690> can<00:02:04.930> they<00:02:05.110> be<00:02:05.140> when<00:02:05.590> they

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:05.800 
at lost weight how can they be when they

00:02:05.800 --> 00:02:07.800 
at lost weight how can they be when they
don't<00:02:06.070> work<00:02:06.370> but<00:02:07.000> the<00:02:07.150> reason<00:02:07.330> is<00:02:07.570> quite

00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:07.810 
don't work but the reason is quite

00:02:07.810 --> 00:02:11.640 
don't work but the reason is quite
simple<00:02:08.310> that<00:02:09.310> these<00:02:10.240> foods<00:02:10.660> they<00:02:10.990> simply<00:02:11.410> have

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:11.650 
simple that these foods they simply have

00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:14.280 
simple that these foods they simply have
a<00:02:11.950> lot<00:02:12.250> of<00:02:12.280> volume<00:02:12.730> but<00:02:13.480> little<00:02:13.870> calorie

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:39.190 
with 90 calories that you've eaten but

00:02:39.190 --> 00:02:42.210 
with 90 calories that you've eaten but
if<00:02:39.489> you<00:02:39.670> eat<00:02:39.880> ten<00:02:40.360> of<00:02:40.540> these<00:02:40.750> bars<00:02:41.140> here<00:02:41.620> then

you have eaten 3,000 calories so by

00:02:45.730 --> 00:02:48.690 
you have eaten 3,000 calories so by
switching<00:02:46.090> to<00:02:46.440> negative<00:02:47.440> calorie<00:02:47.830> foods<00:02:48.220> you

00:02:48.690 --> 00:02:48.700 
switching to negative calorie foods you

00:02:48.700 --> 00:02:51.210 
switching to negative calorie foods you
don't<00:02:49.000> really<00:02:49.630> have<00:02:50.140> negative<00:02:50.800> calorie

00:02:51.210 --> 00:02:51.220 
don't really have negative calorie

00:02:51.220 --> 00:02:53.820 
don't really have negative calorie
content<00:02:52.000> in<00:02:52.390> your<00:02:52.420> stomach<00:02:52.840> but<00:02:53.380> you<00:02:53.560> simply

00:02:53.820 --> 00:02:53.830 
content in your stomach but you simply

00:02:53.830 --> 00:02:57.390 
content in your stomach but you simply
eat<00:02:54.220> a<00:02:54.459> lot<00:02:54.760> less<00:02:55.209> calories<00:02:55.660> in<00:02:56.020> total<00:02:56.440> and<00:02:56.590> it

00:02:57.390 --> 00:02:57.400 
eat a lot less calories in total and it

00:02:57.400 --> 00:03:00.360 
eat a lot less calories in total and it
fills<00:02:57.850> you<00:02:58.090> up<00:02:58.150> more<00:02:58.600> and<00:02:58.810> then<00:02:59.440> of<00:02:59.590> course<00:02:59.620> you

00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:00.370 
fills you up more and then of course you

00:03:00.370 --> 00:03:06.710 
fills you up more and then of course you
lose<00:03:00.640> weight

00:03:06.710 --> 00:03:06.720 

00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:09.350 

so<00:03:07.380> there<00:03:07.650> is<00:03:07.800> nothing<00:03:07.950> wrong<00:03:08.190> with<00:03:08.460> eating

00:03:09.350 --> 00:03:09.360 
so there is nothing wrong with eating

00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:13.430 
so there is nothing wrong with eating
foods<00:03:09.990> on<00:03:10.380> those<00:03:11.040> lists<00:03:11.580> because<00:03:12.440> mostly

00:03:13.430 --> 00:03:13.440 
foods on those lists because mostly

00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:15.830 
foods on those lists because mostly
there<00:03:13.980> are<00:03:14.190> fruits<00:03:14.760> and<00:03:15.150> vegetables<00:03:15.690> and

00:03:15.830 --> 00:03:15.840 
there are fruits and vegetables and

00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:18.500 
there are fruits and vegetables and
those<00:03:15.990> are<00:03:16.230> by<00:03:17.040> themselves<00:03:17.250> healthy<00:03:17.940> for<00:03:18.390> you

00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:18.510 
those are by themselves healthy for you

00:03:18.510 --> 00:03:20.990 
those are by themselves healthy for you
but<00:03:19.020> it<00:03:19.140> will<00:03:19.230> also<00:03:19.470> indeed<00:03:20.160> help<00:03:20.490> you<00:03:20.730> lose

00:03:20.990 --> 00:03:21.000 
but it will also indeed help you lose

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:24.590 
but it will also indeed help you lose
weight<00:03:22.400> because<00:03:23.400> they<00:03:23.820> contain<00:03:24.120> a<00:03:24.180> lot<00:03:24.390> less

00:03:24.590 --> 00:03:24.600 
weight because they contain a lot less

00:03:24.600 --> 00:03:27.230 
weight because they contain a lot less
calories<00:03:25.140> than<00:03:25.380> what<00:03:26.040> you<00:03:26.190> had<00:03:26.460> before<00:03:26.490> you

00:03:27.230 --> 00:03:27.240 
calories than what you had before you

00:03:27.240 --> 00:03:29.030 
calories than what you had before you
should<00:03:27.300> just<00:03:27.660> be<00:03:27.780> realistic<00:03:28.650> about<00:03:28.740> the

00:03:29.030 --> 00:03:29.040 
should just be realistic about the

00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:31.310 
should just be realistic about the
reason<00:03:29.370> what<00:03:29.760> happens<00:03:30.210> here<00:03:30.480> and<00:03:30.690> that<00:03:31.140> there

00:03:31.310 --> 00:03:31.320 
reason what happens here and that there

00:03:31.320 --> 00:03:33.910 
reason what happens here and that there
is<00:03:31.500> no<00:03:31.800> negative<00:03:32.160> caloric<00:03:32.970> content<00:03:33.360> in<00:03:33.810> your
