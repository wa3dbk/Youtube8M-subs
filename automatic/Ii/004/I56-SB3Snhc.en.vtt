00:00:07.210 --> 00:00:11.770
 Yes 

00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:15.670
 hello we are on the fredo 

00:00:11.770 --> 00:00:18.099
 at the exhibition hda in the country and me 

00:00:15.670 --> 00:00:22.080
 always wanted our self-drivers 

00:00:18.099 --> 00:00:25.060
 39 36 horst heldt this is one 

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:29.800
 self-propelled liquid manure vehicle with four 

00:00:25.060 --> 00:00:32.169
 driven big tires all 

00:00:29.800 --> 00:00:34.780
 Dogs can walk and therefore 

00:00:32.169 --> 00:00:37.149
 Soil already be around for a mature one 

00:00:34.780 --> 00:00:38.770
 a spa has something to see exactly here 

00:00:37.149 --> 00:00:42.129
 Could that be the tank in the middle 

00:00:38.770 --> 00:00:44.199
 is constructed and further drive already 

00:00:42.129 --> 00:00:48.129
 second engine and cooler that's all 

00:00:44.199 --> 00:00:49.629
 Incorrectly installed what the vessel 

00:00:48.129 --> 00:00:50.530
 one of them is that we are one lower 

00:00:49.629 --> 00:00:53.890
 have a focus 

00:00:50.530 --> 00:00:56.260
 for maximum stability of the vehicle 

00:00:53.890 --> 00:00:58.929
 19 cubic almost exactly the rent set up 

00:00:56.260 --> 00:01:02.079
 that means nice weight italy 

00:00:58.929 --> 00:01:05.110
 between front and back what you get here 

00:01:02.079 --> 00:01:07.570
 can see that the mature are offset 

00:01:05.110 --> 00:01:08.050
 because of dog walk and also the three-point 

00:01:07.570 --> 00:01:10.510
 behind 

00:01:08.050 --> 00:01:13.659
 I think that you are just as displeased 

00:01:10.510 --> 00:01:17.320
 straight to the lane and the device 

00:01:13.659 --> 00:01:20.680
 what hangs behind purely there is if 

00:01:17.320 --> 00:01:23.079
 one on the location again lifts high 

00:01:20.680 --> 00:01:25.000
 also the rear axle we steer exactly 

00:01:23.079 --> 00:01:27.280
 opposite the one faxes that an 

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:32.290
 entertaining turning circle have the possible 

00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:34.930
 I'm driving back nearly a hundred 

00:01:32.290 --> 00:01:35.759
 let it sink records and again 

00:01:34.930 --> 00:01:39.960
 hit 

00:01:35.759 --> 00:01:42.759
 no matter how sad that drives those 

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:44.890
 Axis is completely locked the 

00:01:42.759 --> 00:01:49.770
 possibility that four wheels all the 

00:01:44.890 --> 00:01:52.840
 have the same drive and why 

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:54.579
 can steplessly drive from 0 to 40 and 

00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:58.570
 even the complete vehicle lock 

00:01:54.579 --> 00:01:59.680
 I can plan to drive because of the 

00:01:58.570 --> 00:02:02.399
 big advantages 

00:01:59.680 --> 00:02:06.210
 that are muffled in front of the axle is the 

00:02:02.399 --> 00:02:09.280
 driver's cabs is at risk and also the 

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:10.899
 power behind has been damped so that 

00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:13.000
 one with maximum comfort over the 

00:02:10.899 --> 00:02:13.340
 Road driver and also in the process 

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:15.349
 can 

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:17.510
 which is also a big advantage from the vehicle 

00:02:15.349 --> 00:02:20.959
 is that she has an outside width of three 

00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:22.550
 meters has been over three meter needs 

00:02:20.959 --> 00:02:24.200
 one after ยง 70 or something 

00:02:22.550 --> 00:02:27.050
 that is not for this vehicle 

00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:29.269
 necessary here you can see a new one 

00:02:27.050 --> 00:02:29.930
 Kubik Vogelsang pump for a big one 

00:02:29.269 --> 00:02:32.239
 power 

00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:34.700
 The pump has been protected frames 

00:02:32.239 --> 00:02:37.250
 snowing filter that is fankurve 

00:02:34.700 --> 00:02:38.780
 thrown out and grass and so as a target 

00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:40.879
 reach that is cut but 

00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:41.349
 then brings a pity to the afterwards 

00:02:40.879 --> 00:02:43.849
 pump 

00:02:41.349 --> 00:02:47.150
 you can see it is a cat whole 

00:02:43.849 --> 00:02:50.180
 Short way the sac comes exactly 

00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:53.420
 right into the snowing fields through the 

00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:56.120
 pump that is a maximum capacity to 

00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:57.920
 short way here is then 16 o'clock 

00:02:56.120 --> 00:03:00.890
 Connection that you need for example 

00:02:57.920 --> 00:03:02.629
 when overloaded from chile or truck i 

00:03:00.890 --> 00:03:03.650
 I want to introduce you again and so on 

00:03:02.629 --> 00:03:11.090
 both novelties 

00:03:03.650 --> 00:03:15.670
 because 45 46 with 450 ps or the 55 18 with 

00:03:11.090 --> 00:03:18.829
 550 ps and stepless Vario transmission 

00:03:15.670 --> 00:03:21.470
 This variant is two axes or 

00:03:18.829 --> 00:03:25.280
 three-axle with all driven too 

00:03:21.470 --> 00:03:27.100
 get a whopping 906 with 42 

00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:30.769
 bikes 

00:03:27.100 --> 00:03:33.799
 this one is the successor of the 39 36 

00:03:30.769 --> 00:03:36.349
 has the same mechanical advantages 

00:03:33.799 --> 00:03:40.310
 hydraulic drive very short 

00:03:36.349 --> 00:03:42.230
 turning circle and 1050 tires for whole 

00:03:40.310 --> 00:03:44.540
 drive already ground that was once 

00:03:42.230 --> 00:03:47.030
 short presentation of our vehicle 

00:03:44.540 --> 00:03:49.609
 more information can be found at 

00:03:47.030 --> 00:03:53.120
 fredo on our homepage or call 

00:03:49.609 --> 00:03:55.250
 she just comes to us because they are the ones 

00:03:53.120 --> 00:03:58.000
 number of more or my colleagues and 

00:03:55.250 --> 00:04:01.000
 We like to have several advantages 

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:01.000
