40 60 s and the 40 626 we've made it Joe
a<00:00:53.750> little<00:00:54.289> slimmer<00:00:54.710> in<00:00:55.010> the<00:00:55.070> profile<00:00:55.609> so<00:00:56.059> you

00:00:56.319 --> 00:00:56.329 
a little slimmer in the profile so you

00:00:56.329 --> 00:00:58.540 
a little slimmer in the profile so you
don't<00:00:57.109> see<00:00:57.289> it<00:00:57.410> as<00:00:57.530> much<00:00:57.680> this<00:00:57.949> will<00:00:58.129> go<00:00:58.309> into

00:00:58.540 --> 00:00:58.550 
don't see it as much this will go into

00:01:10.900 --> 00:01:10.910 
really want to show to that we have a

00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:13.270 
really want to show to that we have a
microphone<00:01:11.270> that<00:01:11.660> sits<00:01:12.530> really<00:01:12.710> well<00:01:13.010> on<00:01:13.040> the

00:01:13.270 --> 00:01:13.280 
microphone that sits really well on the

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:16.900 
microphone that sits really well on the
head<00:01:13.490> so<00:01:14.500> we've<00:01:15.500> demonstrated<00:01:15.740> this<00:01:16.250> at<00:01:16.760> this

00:01:16.900 --> 00:01:16.910 
head so we've demonstrated this at this

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:18.940 
head so we've demonstrated this at this
show<00:01:17.150> with<00:01:17.540> a<00:01:17.570> video<00:01:17.990> that<00:01:18.020> we've<00:01:18.440> got<00:01:18.650> running

00:01:18.940 --> 00:01:18.950 
show with a video that we've got running

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:20.319 
show with a video that we've got running
behind<00:01:19.070> us<00:01:19.369> here<00:01:19.520> where<00:01:19.790> a<00:01:19.820> guy<00:01:20.030> is<00:01:20.090> doing

00:01:20.319 --> 00:01:20.329 
behind us here where a guy is doing

00:01:20.329 --> 00:01:23.620 
behind us here where a guy is doing
parkour<00:01:21.159> and<00:01:22.159> that<00:01:22.369> actually<00:01:22.880> just<00:01:23.210> shows

00:01:23.620 --> 00:01:23.630 
parkour and that actually just shows

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:25.870 
parkour and that actually just shows
that<00:01:23.659> you<00:01:23.990> can<00:01:24.170> jump<00:01:24.710> around<00:01:24.829> with<00:01:25.310> this

00:01:25.870 --> 00:01:25.880 
that you can jump around with this

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:27.640 
that you can jump around with this
microphone<00:01:26.360> without<00:01:26.659> any<00:01:27.020> problems<00:01:27.409> with<00:01:27.530> it

00:01:27.640 --> 00:01:27.650 
microphone without any problems with it

00:01:27.650 --> 00:01:30.550 
microphone without any problems with it
so<00:01:28.310> but<00:01:28.670> it's<00:01:29.240> it's<00:01:29.750> a<00:01:29.869> microphone<00:01:30.290> that

00:01:30.550 --> 00:01:30.560 
so but it's it's a microphone that

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:33.789 
so but it's it's a microphone that
consists<00:01:31.100> of<00:01:31.189> three<00:01:31.460> different<00:01:31.640> pieces<00:01:32.799> it's

00:01:33.789 --> 00:01:33.799 
consists of three different pieces it's

00:01:33.799 --> 00:01:38.410 
consists of three different pieces it's
got<00:01:34.009> the<00:01:34.310> earhook<00:01:36.399> it's<00:01:37.399> got<00:01:37.759> the<00:01:38.180> microphone

00:01:38.410 --> 00:01:38.420 
got the earhook it's got the microphone

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:41.710 
got the earhook it's got the microphone
