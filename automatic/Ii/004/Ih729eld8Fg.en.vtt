this<00:00:41.469> is<00:00:41.680> the<00:00:41.859> prep<00:00:42.100> for<00:00:42.370> the<00:00:42.670> the<00:00:42.910> beet<00:00:43.090> caviar

this is the prep for the the beet caviar

00:00:43.510 --> 00:00:47.729 
this is the prep for the the beet caviar
it's<00:00:44.289> a<00:00:44.379> gel<00:00:44.620> bead<00:00:45.780> the<00:00:46.780> bead<00:00:46.809> is<00:00:47.109> juiced<00:00:47.379> and

it's a gel bead the bead is juiced and

00:00:47.739 --> 00:00:50.610 
it's a gel bead the bead is juiced and
then<00:00:48.160> juice<00:00:48.339> has<00:00:48.519> been<00:00:48.930> introduced<00:00:49.930> to<00:00:50.170> a<00:00:50.350> gel

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:50.620 
then juice has been introduced to a gel

00:00:50.620 --> 00:00:53.270 
then juice has been introduced to a gel
system<00:00:50.860> and<00:00:51.489> that's<00:00:51.640> where<00:00:51.760> the<00:00:51.820> beads<00:00:52.000> coming

system and that's where the beads coming
this<00:00:54.280> is<00:00:54.309> just<00:00:54.820> frozen<00:00:55.629> grape<00:00:55.780> seed<00:00:55.960> oil<00:00:56.019> this

00:00:56.639 --> 00:00:56.649 
this is just frozen grape seed oil this

00:00:56.649 --> 00:00:58.649 
this is just frozen grape seed oil this
is<00:00:56.799> kind<00:00:57.010> of<00:00:57.070> a<00:00:57.190> different<00:00:57.909> technique<00:00:58.329> than

00:00:58.649 --> 00:00:58.659 
is kind of a different technique than

a calcium bath I do think this is a

00:01:08.110 --> 00:01:12.600 
a calcium bath I do think this is a

specific style that is unique to him and

00:01:14.710 --> 00:01:17.070 
specific style that is unique to him and
really<00:01:14.920> cool<00:01:15.130> to<00:01:15.220> watch<00:01:15.340> because<00:01:15.640> it's<00:01:16.630> often

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:17.080 
really cool to watch because it's often

00:01:17.080 --> 00:01:20.160 
really cool to watch because it's often
like<00:01:17.110> people<00:01:17.800> try<00:01:18.039> and<00:01:18.300> imitate<00:01:19.300> or<00:01:19.840> like<00:01:19.990> try

like people try and imitate or like try
and<00:01:20.200> do<00:01:20.350> the<00:01:20.440> same<00:01:20.470> sort<00:01:20.649> of<00:01:20.890> things<00:01:21.130> you<00:01:21.310> just

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:21.340 
and do the same sort of things you just

00:01:21.340 --> 00:01:22.559 
and do the same sort of things you just
can't<00:01:21.490> hit<00:01:21.850> it<00:01:21.940> quite<00:01:22.030> as<00:01:22.149> well<00:01:22.300> as<00:01:22.330> he<00:01:22.479> does

00:01:22.559 --> 00:01:22.569 
can't hit it quite as well as he does

00:01:22.569 --> 00:01:24.300 
can't hit it quite as well as he does
it's<00:01:22.869> really<00:01:22.899> impossible<00:01:23.229> it's<00:01:24.009> very

00:01:24.300 --> 00:01:24.310 
it's really impossible it's very

00:01:24.310 --> 00:01:29.850 
it's really impossible it's very
interesting<00:01:24.550> guy<00:01:24.850> to<00:01:24.909> work<00:01:25.149> with<00:01:28.619> all<00:01:29.619> right

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:29.860 
interesting guy to work with all right

00:01:29.860 --> 00:01:31.680 
interesting guy to work with all right
so<00:01:30.069> let's<00:01:30.190> see<00:01:30.340> if<00:01:30.399> we<00:01:30.520> can<00:01:30.610> get<00:01:30.759> a<00:01:30.789> this<00:01:31.300> party

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:31.690 
so let's see if we can get a this party

00:01:31.690 --> 00:01:45.180 
so let's see if we can get a this party
going<00:01:38.759> it's<00:01:39.759> nature's<00:01:40.090> candy

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:45.190 

00:01:45.190 --> 00:01:48.010 

the<00:01:46.190> key<00:01:46.460> is<00:01:46.610> that<00:01:46.640> it's<00:01:47.270> something<00:01:47.540> perfect

00:01:48.010 --> 00:01:48.020 
the key is that it's something perfect

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:50.170 
the key is that it's something perfect
in<00:01:48.140> nature<00:01:48.260> like<00:01:48.440> a<00:01:48.590> beat<00:01:48.860> and<00:01:49.370> it's<00:01:49.730> slightly

00:01:50.170 --> 00:01:50.180 
in nature like a beat and it's slightly

00:01:50.180 --> 00:01:52.930 
in nature like a beat and it's slightly
adulterated<00:01:50.810> into<00:01:51.290> another<00:01:51.830> product<00:01:52.130> a<00:01:52.520> whole

00:01:52.930 --> 00:01:52.940 
adulterated into another product a whole

00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:56.070 
adulterated into another product a whole
nother<00:01:53.290> presentation<00:01:54.290> but<00:01:54.470> it's<00:01:54.620> still<00:01:54.820> 99.9%

00:01:56.070 --> 00:01:56.080 
nother presentation but it's still 99.9%

00:01:56.080 --> 00:01:59.350 
nother presentation but it's still 99.9%
beat<00:01:57.080> in<00:01:57.320> the<00:01:57.470> end<00:01:57.820> the<00:01:58.820> second<00:01:59.120> part<00:01:59.240> of<00:01:59.270> the

00:01:59.350 --> 00:01:59.360 
beat in the end the second part of the

00:01:59.360 --> 00:02:01.630 
beat in the end the second part of the
dish<00:01:59.540> is<00:01:59.750> that<00:02:00.200> the<00:02:00.440> tangerine<00:02:00.860> foam<00:02:01.070> with<00:02:01.520> the

00:02:01.630 --> 00:02:01.640 
dish is that the tangerine foam with the

00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:09.060 
dish is that the tangerine foam with the
soy<00:02:02.030> protein

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:09.070 

00:02:09.070 --> 00:02:11.940 

it<00:02:10.070> mimics<00:02:10.430> caviar<00:02:10.940> in<00:02:11.030> the<00:02:11.150> presentation

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:11.950 
it mimics caviar in the presentation

00:02:11.950 --> 00:02:14.080 
it mimics caviar in the presentation
what<00:02:12.950> is<00:02:13.040> that<00:02:13.160> you<00:02:13.310> put<00:02:13.490> on<00:02:13.580> top<00:02:13.760> of<00:02:13.880> it

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:14.090 
what is that you put on top of it

00:02:14.090 --> 00:02:15.820 
what is that you put on top of it
that<00:02:14.270> was<00:02:14.390> the<00:02:14.480> orange<00:02:14.690> salt<00:02:14.930> so<00:02:15.560> you<00:02:15.620> get<00:02:15.710> the

00:02:15.820 --> 00:02:15.830 
that was the orange salt so you get the

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:17.710 
that was the orange salt so you get the
salt<00:02:16.040> aid<00:02:16.280> and<00:02:16.760> it<00:02:16.880> brings<00:02:17.180> out<00:02:17.330> a<00:02:17.360> little<00:02:17.540> bit

00:02:17.710 --> 00:02:17.720 
salt aid and it brings out a little bit

that's<00:04:50.650> what<00:04:50.770> people<00:04:50.919> say<00:04:51.189> but<00:04:51.339> I<00:04:51.669> feel<00:04:52.180> like
