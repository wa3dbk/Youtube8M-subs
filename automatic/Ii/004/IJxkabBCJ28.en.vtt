00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.859
 Well, it's a YouTube-like gang 

00:00:03.030 --> 00:00:06.779
 are reporting is once again for 

00:00:04.859 --> 00:00:09.300
 all of you your napkin in your 

00:00:06.779 --> 00:00:13.139
 server your sponsor your all your 

00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:16.379
 father his son his machete of all the nothing 

00:00:13.139 --> 00:00:18.090
 a little joke the diamond a new 

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:20.760
 commented gameplay I do when with the 

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:25.620
 in 94 with this sexy camouflage 

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:29.490
 that is called as this Cobra calls 

00:00:25.620 --> 00:00:31.050
 scales or something like that but the dragon I think 

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:33.060
 which is called dragon camouflage right now 

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:34.680
 that comes to mind, it looks very sexy 

00:00:33.060 --> 00:00:36.240
 it's one of the kind of flashes that 

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:39.380
 liked in all the like flashes that 

00:00:36.240 --> 00:00:41.700
 they came to take out in the packs of 

00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:43.590
 level customization killing atomic 

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:45.150
 with my client three times in a row 

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:47.190
 which first kill with hollywood 

00:00:45.150 --> 00:00:49.860
 after the second I killed that came 

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:51.540
 with your pc w any month of mc something like that 

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:53.040
 he killed him again and they see me 

00:00:51.540 --> 00:00:55.350
 dodging this grenade I did not know if 

00:00:53.040 --> 00:00:57.989
 she was an ally or an enemy to others 

00:00:55.350 --> 00:01:00.269
 ways as I think he brought goes in this 

00:00:57.989 --> 00:01:02.610
 ghost gameplay on the advantage of 

00:01:00.269 --> 00:01:04.890
 screen then I decided to dodge it for 

00:01:02.610 --> 00:01:07.650
 avoid risks because he was good 

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:09.570
 when I was playing just for 

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:11.640
 teams but they were land warfare like 

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:14.220
 I wanted to not play the goal and 

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:17.730
 you could simply say that by helping 

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:19.290
 the team to kill or take out the dogs and 

00:01:17.730 --> 00:01:20.909
 instead, because I'm bringing these 

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:23.610
 low and so good I'll try to 

00:01:20.909 --> 00:01:26.550
 get that out and thus help as a team and that 

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:28.240
 they are responsible for capturing let's say 

00:01:26.550 --> 00:01:30.369
 the flags 

00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:32.350
 or grab the medals maybe good at 

00:01:30.369 --> 00:01:33.670
 low confirmed because the 

00:01:32.350 --> 00:01:36.640
 medals also because they are a lot 

00:01:33.670 --> 00:01:38.619
 help but more than anything else 

00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:40.689
 in 2000 on sion but good when I 

00:01:38.619 --> 00:01:42.700
 I wanted to tell you about a topic 

00:01:40.689 --> 00:01:44.680
 apart from this implies large fund that 

00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:48.490
 well it was also a great gameplay 41 

00:01:44.680 --> 00:01:50.770
 vague to being or death is something that I think 

00:01:48.490 --> 00:01:53.259
 that what has killed the most and that they have not 

00:01:50.770 --> 00:01:55.000
 killed in team duel is very 

00:01:53.259 --> 00:01:57.280
 weird that they do not kill me since most 

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:59.470
 of people always here employs and much more 

00:01:57.280 --> 00:02:00.970
 here in good not much more but let's say 

00:01:59.470 --> 00:02:03.580
 there are more players here at war 

00:02:00.970 --> 00:02:05.200
 land a 

00:02:03.580 --> 00:02:06.910
 in a few more players in the 

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:09.070
 enemy team but we will change 

00:02:06.910 --> 00:02:11.620
 issue now yes good before that for 

00:02:09.070 --> 00:02:13.240
 here they see me fail and I walk very ugly and what 

00:02:11.620 --> 00:02:16.120
 happens is that I had very sensitive 

00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:17.320
 low as I told you not from already 

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:20.320
 I had commented when the 

00:02:17.320 --> 00:02:22.180
 sensitivity number 4 then that to the 

00:02:20.320 --> 00:02:23.950
 time for us to say I get from behind 

00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:25.780
 Well, I'm practically dead because 

00:02:23.950 --> 00:02:27.880
 I can not react fast I can not 

00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:29.560
 change fast in sensitivity the 

00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:31.570
 change then to help my aim 

00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:33.160
 I feel like the weapon does not move 

00:02:31.570 --> 00:02:34.510
 a lot because it's killing them very fast 

00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:36.580
 you of our opinion see the 

00:02:34.510 --> 00:02:38.080
 gameplay check it and our bread yo 

00:02:36.580 --> 00:02:40.030
 I do not think I can get the dogs out 

00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:41.860
 they had the orbit in the air more 

00:02:40.030 --> 00:02:44.220
 seen is nobody allow the other good as well 

00:02:41.860 --> 00:02:46.480
 I was not 7 

00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:48.310
 sniper that was changing there in the 

00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:50.920
 boat or on the boat I do not know what it is that 

00:02:48.310 --> 00:02:52.540
 be but good for the little one who wanted 

00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:54.700
 talk with you was a new 

00:02:52.540 --> 00:02:56.920
 game which I plan to buy now that 

00:02:54.700 --> 00:02:59.260
 come out or well maybe not as soon as it comes out 

00:02:56.920 --> 00:03:00.880
 but I hope that if a streak of 20 me 

00:02:59.260 --> 00:03:02.410
 I clicked but it did not save me and I had to do 

00:03:00.880 --> 00:03:04.780
 a rocker to kill that is nobody by 

00:03:02.410 --> 00:03:07.090
 killed the other and the other was there in the 

00:03:04.780 --> 00:03:07.720
 source trying to make such a wish 

00:03:07.090 --> 00:03:09.820
 time 

00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:12.040
 they see that supposedly if they talk about their 

00:03:09.820 --> 00:03:13.930
 in love a fountain perez the desire is 

00:03:12.040 --> 00:03:16.240
 meets when it is supposedly 

00:03:13.930 --> 00:03:19.240
 I knew for now if we're going to talk about what 

00:03:16.240 --> 00:03:20.650
 I'm telling you, there's a gay man 

00:03:19.240 --> 00:03:23.090
 is going to say a gameplay a game to which 

00:03:20.650 --> 00:03:25.489
 I was struck by a shooter 

00:03:23.090 --> 00:03:27.650
 a first person that normally 

00:03:25.489 --> 00:03:29.540
 it's very rare that some other game like 

00:03:27.650 --> 00:03:31.190
 these first- person calls me the 

00:03:29.540 --> 00:03:33.790
 attention since I'm very used to 

00:03:31.190 --> 00:03:33.790
 kolo tourÃ© 

00:03:33.880 --> 00:03:37.120
 you have to get a run of 25 for 

00:03:35.890 --> 00:03:38.590
 I was about to take the 

00:03:37.120 --> 00:03:40.510
 industry also do accounts there 

00:03:38.590 --> 00:03:42.400
 account in mind as soon as you kill 

00:03:40.510 --> 00:03:44.080
 after that streak already as I say 

00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:46.120
 I swore there that caught my attention 

00:03:44.080 --> 00:03:48.190
 which is called titan fail I've seen 

00:03:46.120 --> 00:03:49.810
 gameplays most of the game plays 

00:03:48.190 --> 00:03:53.020
 that has uploaded the official channel of the game 

00:03:49.810 --> 00:03:55.060
 and the truth is a mixture between hello and 

00:03:53.020 --> 00:03:57.700
 call of duty if I'm not wrong 

00:03:55.060 --> 00:03:59.800
 I remember where I saw people from halo 

00:03:57.700 --> 00:04:01.270
 I worked on Facebook and call of duty 

00:03:59.800 --> 00:04:03.280
 were the ones who helped create this 

00:04:01.270 --> 00:04:04.900
 game and it caught my attention more 

00:04:03.280 --> 00:04:07.569
 that several signatures that is the most 

00:04:04.900 --> 00:04:09.700
 any other game I've seen 

00:04:07.569 --> 00:04:12.280
 in the reasons that I think it looks like a 

00:04:09.700 --> 00:04:13.569
 little bit of color but I feel like it's going 

00:04:12.280 --> 00:04:17.320
 have different game modes 

00:04:13.569 --> 00:04:19.870
 different gameplay is there is like 

00:04:17.320 --> 00:04:21.190
 very large robots you can jump between 

00:04:19.870 --> 00:04:24.370
 the buildings the truth looks striking 

00:04:21.190 --> 00:04:26.919
 the game and it's a game that I think I think 

00:04:24.370 --> 00:04:28.210
 buy and try it I would not like to know 

00:04:26.919 --> 00:04:29.860
 the opinion of each one of you 

00:04:28.210 --> 00:04:32.139
 you think that this is going to be a 

00:04:29.860 --> 00:04:34.270
 great game I think most people 

00:04:32.139 --> 00:04:35.590
 of color is very anxious to have this 

00:04:34.270 --> 00:04:36.880
 game let's say a little bit of the 

00:04:35.590 --> 00:04:38.740
 community of color and I want to try it 

00:04:36.880 --> 00:04:40.030
 because it makes it look good for a me 

00:04:38.740 --> 00:04:41.830
 would be another opinion within 

00:04:40.030 --> 00:04:44.289
 you leave some comment in the 

00:04:41.830 --> 00:04:46.449
 bottom part if you feel like it and if you 

00:04:44.289 --> 00:04:50.669
 like you can leave a like I say goodbye 

00:04:46.449 --> 00:04:50.669
 take care of yourself goodbye gang
