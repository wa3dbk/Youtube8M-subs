um so you have your typical enchantment

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:52.760 
um so you have your typical enchantment
set<00:00:49.410> up<00:00:49.559> here<00:00:49.800> 33<00:00:50.730> f<00:00:51.239> 32<00:00:51.690> book<00:00:52.260> shares<00:00:52.530> or

00:00:58.549 --> 00:00:58.559 
will try to enchant this time pickaxe

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:01.189 
will try to enchant this time pickaxe
first<00:00:59.100> ok<00:00:59.760> you<00:01:00.059> see<00:01:00.270> my<00:01:00.420> enchantment<00:01:00.780> level<00:01:01.140> is

00:01:01.189 --> 00:01:01.199 
first ok you see my enchantment level is

00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:05.570 
first ok you see my enchantment level is
very<00:01:01.260> high<00:01:01.530> I<00:01:01.920> did<00:01:02.129> this<00:01:02.309> with<00:01:02.699> a<00:01:03.530> MBT<00:01:04.530> edit<00:01:04.860> we

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:05.580 
very high I did this with a MBT edit we

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:07.700 
very high I did this with a MBT edit we
have<00:01:05.850> a<00:01:06.090> video<00:01:06.390> on<00:01:06.600> our<00:01:06.840> channel<00:01:07.260> how<00:01:07.409> to<00:01:07.470> use

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:07.710 
have a video on our channel how to use

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:09.620 
have a video on our channel how to use
it<00:01:07.890> as<00:01:08.010> well<00:01:08.189> I<00:01:08.369> will<00:01:08.670> provide<00:01:09.030> the<00:01:09.060> link<00:01:09.330> in

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:09.630 
it as well I will provide the link in

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:12.649 
it as well I will provide the link in
the<00:01:09.689> description<00:01:09.780> as<00:01:10.350> well<00:01:10.430> so<00:01:11.430> let's<00:01:11.909> roll

00:01:12.649 --> 00:01:12.659 
the description as well so let's roll

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:16.490 
the description as well so let's roll
for<00:01:13.170> yeah<00:01:13.409> that<00:01:13.890> sounds<00:01:14.189> good<00:01:14.630> 35<00:01:15.630> and<00:01:15.840> now<00:01:16.470> I

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:16.500 
for yeah that sounds good 35 and now I

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:19.550 
for yeah that sounds good 35 and now I
go<00:01:16.770> to<00:01:16.830> my<00:01:17.100> enchantment<00:01:17.610> calculator<00:01:18.560> select

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:19.560 
go to my enchantment calculator select

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:22.370 
go to my enchantment calculator select
for<00:01:19.710> item<00:01:19.979> type<00:01:20.220> it's<00:01:20.790> a<00:01:20.970> pickaxe<00:01:21.360> and<00:01:21.570> the

00:01:22.370 --> 00:01:22.380 
for item type it's a pickaxe and the

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:26.300 
for item type it's a pickaxe and the
material<00:01:22.979> is<00:01:23.630> diamond<00:01:24.630> now<00:01:25.619> I<00:01:25.650> type<00:01:26.100> in

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:26.310 
material is diamond now I type in

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:30.010 
material is diamond now I type in
enchantment<00:01:26.790> level<00:01:27.299> 45<00:01:28.080> and<00:01:28.380> press<00:01:29.250> calculate

00:01:30.010 --> 00:01:30.020 
enchantment level 45 and press calculate

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:35.620 
enchantment level 45 and press calculate
so<00:01:31.020> this<00:01:31.890> is<00:01:32.100> what<00:01:32.670> I<00:01:32.700> probably<00:01:33.299> will<00:01:33.750> get<00:01:33.990> our

00:01:35.620 --> 00:01:35.630 
so this is what I probably will get our

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:38.630 
so this is what I probably will get our
efficiency<00:01:36.630> far<00:01:36.900> for<00:01:37.350> slipped<00:01:38.070> out<00:01:38.220> one<00:01:38.460> and

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:38.640 
efficiency far for slipped out one and

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:42.530 
efficiency far for slipped out one and
breaking<00:01:39.240> free<00:01:39.689> of<00:01:39.900> fortune<00:01:40.560> and<00:01:40.740> if<00:01:41.490> i<00:01:41.670> go<00:01:42.509> to

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:42.540 
breaking free of fortune and if i go to

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:46.190 
breaking free of fortune and if i go to
run<00:01:42.899> thousand<00:01:43.320> times<00:01:43.549> this<00:01:44.549> is<00:01:44.790> the<00:01:45.090> chart<00:01:45.869> for

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:46.200 
run thousand times this is the chart for

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:51.080 
run thousand times this is the chart for
which<00:01:47.060> enchantments<00:01:48.060> of<00:01:48.180> a<00:01:49.130> most<00:01:50.130> accurate

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:51.090 
which enchantments of a most accurate

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:53.569 
which enchantments of a most accurate
ones<00:01:51.479> that<00:01:51.869> i<00:01:51.990> will<00:01:52.290> probably<00:01:52.770> get<00:01:52.920> so<00:01:53.310> the

00:01:53.569 --> 00:01:53.579 
ones that i will probably get so the

00:01:53.579 --> 00:01:55.389 
ones that i will probably get so the
highest<00:01:53.850> ones<00:01:54.030> are<00:01:54.210> unbreaking<00:01:54.780> free<00:01:54.990> and

00:01:55.389 --> 00:01:55.399 
highest ones are unbreaking free and

00:01:55.399 --> 00:02:00.190 
highest ones are unbreaking free and
efficiency<00:01:56.399> free<00:01:56.880> so<00:01:57.630> let's<00:01:58.290> pick<00:01:58.530> it

00:02:00.190 --> 00:02:00.200 
efficiency free so let's pick it

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:06.880 
efficiency free so let's pick it
efficiency<00:02:01.200> free<00:02:01.409> so<00:02:01.829> you<00:02:02.729> see<00:02:02.969> you<00:02:03.329> can<00:02:04.820> see

00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:06.890 
efficiency free so you see you can see

00:02:06.890 --> 00:02:10.550 
efficiency free so you see you can see
pretty<00:02:07.890> accurate<00:02:08.759> which<00:02:09.410> enchantment<00:02:10.410> you

00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:10.560 
pretty accurate which enchantment you

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:13.610 
pretty accurate which enchantment you
will<00:02:10.739> get<00:02:10.920> so<00:02:11.489> if<00:02:11.760> i<00:02:12.000> put<00:02:12.030> in<00:02:12.330> diamond<00:02:12.780> boots

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:13.620 
will get so if i put in diamond boots

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:18.380 
will get so if i put in diamond boots
go<00:02:14.370> to<00:02:14.430> oops<00:02:15.239> meet<00:02:15.540> you<00:02:15.780> itemtype<00:02:17.390> wherever

00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:18.390 
go to oops meet you itemtype wherever

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:23.630 
go to oops meet you itemtype wherever
boots<00:02:18.690> boots<00:02:19.110> and<00:02:20.180> 31<00:02:21.180> that's<00:02:21.420> good<00:02:21.870> but<00:02:22.640> 40

00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:23.640 
boots boots and 31 that's good but 40

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:27.940 
boots boots and 31 that's good but 40
that's<00:02:23.909> even<00:02:24.209> better<00:02:24.830> fari<00:02:26.510> calculate

00:02:27.940 --> 00:02:27.950 
that's even better fari calculate

00:02:27.950 --> 00:02:33.920 
that's even better fari calculate
protection<00:02:28.950> for<00:02:30.799> protection<00:02:31.799> free<00:02:32.040> hmm<00:02:32.930> it's

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:33.930 
protection for protection free hmm it's

00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:36.530 
protection for protection free hmm it's
weird<00:02:34.200> never<00:02:35.099> have<00:02:35.340> this<00:02:35.519> and<00:02:35.819> head<00:02:36.090> that<00:02:36.120> in

00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:36.540 
weird never have this and head that in

00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:38.839 
weird never have this and head that in
my<00:02:36.659> tests<00:02:36.989> oh<00:02:37.110> but<00:02:37.799> if<00:02:37.950> you<00:02:38.099> run<00:02:38.250> it<00:02:38.370> 2,000

00:02:38.849 --> 00:02:41.180 
my tests oh but if you run it 2,000
times<00:02:39.000> it<00:02:39.299> says<00:02:39.629> protection<00:02:40.590> free<00:02:40.920> is<00:02:41.040> the

00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:41.190 
times it says protection free is the

00:02:41.190 --> 00:02:45.020 
times it says protection free is the
most<00:02:41.370> accurate<00:02:41.549> one<00:02:42.030> so<00:02:42.480> I<00:02:42.890> guess<00:02:44.030> pressing

00:02:45.020 --> 00:02:45.030 
most accurate one so I guess pressing

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:48.050 
most accurate one so I guess pressing
run<00:02:45.360> tau<00:02:45.599> a<00:02:45.780> thousand<00:02:46.530> runs<00:02:46.680> it's<00:02:47.010> even<00:02:47.879> more

00:02:48.050 --> 00:02:48.060 
run tau a thousand runs it's even more

00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:54.349 
run tau a thousand runs it's even more
accurate<00:02:48.510> than<00:02:49.190> just<00:02:50.329> do<00:02:51.329> it<00:02:51.480> one<00:02:51.690> time<00:02:51.720> so<00:02:53.359> 49

00:02:54.349 --> 00:02:54.359 
accurate than just do it one time so 49

00:02:54.359 --> 00:03:04.059 
accurate than just do it one time so 49
