00:02:20.470 --> 00:02:20.480 
you stay here go okay anyways so I

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:24.130 
you stay here go okay anyways so I
filled<00:02:21.470> this<00:02:21.739> hand<00:02:22.130> grinder<00:02:22.819> that<00:02:23.750> I<00:02:23.780> have

00:02:24.130 --> 00:02:24.140

with some dehydrated roasted garlic and

00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:35.699 
with some dehydrated roasted garlic and
this<00:02:29.870> works<00:02:30.140> pretty<00:02:30.470> good<00:02:32.530> as<00:02:33.530> you<00:02:33.709> can<00:02:33.920> see

00:03:54.260 --> 00:03:54.270 
ten dollars for a fancy one and it will

00:03:54.270 --> 00:03:59.660 
ten dollars for a fancy one and it will
produce<00:03:55.370> your<00:03:56.720> garlic<00:03:57.720> powder<00:03:58.430> this<00:03:59.430> one<00:03:59.610> I

think<00:03:59.730> actually<00:04:00.390> does<00:04:01.170> a<00:04:01.200> little<00:04:01.440> bit<00:04:01.590> better

00:04:01.640 --> 00:04:01.650 
think actually does a little bit better

00:04:01.650 --> 00:04:03.740 
think actually does a little bit better
because<00:04:02.070> it's<00:04:02.370> a<00:04:02.520> little<00:04:02.670> bit<00:04:02.910> finer<00:04:03.240> than<00:04:03.600> the

00:04:03.740 --> 00:04:03.750 
because it's a little bit finer than the

00:04:03.750 --> 00:04:07.160 
because it's a little bit finer than the
other<00:04:03.900> one<00:04:04.170> just<00:04:05.030> watch<00:04:06.030> your<00:04:06.330> fingers<00:04:06.540> that

00:04:07.160 --> 00:04:07.170 
other one just watch your fingers that

00:04:07.170 --> 00:04:10.340 
other one just watch your fingers that
you<00:04:07.350> don't<00:04:07.560> take<00:04:08.370> off<00:04:09.060> the<00:04:09.480> skin<00:04:09.750> of<00:04:09.930> your<00:04:09.960> hand

00:04:10.340 --> 00:04:10.350 
you don't take off the skin of your hand

00:04:10.350 --> 00:04:18.680 
you don't take off the skin of your hand

00:04:18.680 --> 00:04:18.690 
and so this is three different ways that
