it<00:00:15.960> to<00:00:16.109> you<00:00:16.230> the<00:00:17.010> laser<00:00:17.250> is<00:00:17.430> a<00:00:17.580> machine<00:00:17.850> that<00:00:18.690> he

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:18.810 
it to you the laser is a machine that he

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:20.630 
it to you the laser is a machine that he
missed<00:00:19.080> this<00:00:19.230> focused<00:00:19.740> beam<00:00:19.890> of<00:00:19.920> light<00:00:20.279> and

00:00:20.630 --> 00:00:20.640 
missed this focused beam of light and

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:22.460 
missed this focused beam of light and
the<00:00:21.119> light<00:00:21.150> is<00:00:21.390> unique<00:00:21.900> because<00:00:22.109> it<00:00:22.380> can

00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:22.470 
the light is unique because it can

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:24.380 
the light is unique because it can
penetrate<00:00:22.650> our<00:00:23.039> skin<00:00:23.369> without<00:00:23.519> damage<00:00:24.119> again

00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:24.390 
penetrate our skin without damage again

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:26.839 
penetrate our skin without damage again
and<00:00:24.600> it<00:00:25.109> goes<00:00:25.320> in<00:00:25.619> and<00:00:25.890> it<00:00:26.010> breaks<00:00:26.279> up<00:00:26.490> the<00:00:26.550> ink

00:00:26.839 --> 00:00:26.849 
and it goes in and it breaks up the ink

00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:30.080 
and it goes in and it breaks up the ink
it<00:00:27.660> shatters<00:00:28.260> it<00:00:28.410> if<00:00:28.529> you<00:00:28.650> will<00:00:28.830> so<00:00:29.760> then<00:00:29.939> your

00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:30.090 
it shatters it if you will so then your

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:32.089 
it shatters it if you will so then your
body<00:00:30.269> fused<00:00:30.869> that<00:00:31.080> shattered<00:00:31.619> ink<00:00:31.830> as<00:00:32.070> a

00:00:32.089 --> 00:00:32.099 
body fused that shattered ink as a

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:34.040 
body fused that shattered ink as a
foreign<00:00:32.520> object<00:00:32.700> and<00:00:33.180> wants<00:00:33.690> to<00:00:33.719> flush<00:00:34.020> it

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:34.050 
foreign object and wants to flush it

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:36.740 
foreign object and wants to flush it
away<00:00:34.280> so<00:00:35.280> your<00:00:35.430> body<00:00:35.610> will<00:00:35.910> send<00:00:36.180> lymph<00:00:36.510> will

00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:36.750 
away so your body will send lymph will

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:39.200 
away so your body will send lymph will
send<00:00:36.960> a<00:00:36.989> circulation<00:00:37.530> to<00:00:37.710> the<00:00:37.800> area<00:00:38.059> trying<00:00:39.059> to

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:39.210 
send a circulation to the area trying to

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:42.110 
send a circulation to the area trying to
flush<00:00:39.480> those<00:00:39.719> fragments<00:00:40.050> away<00:00:40.640> the<00:00:41.640> fragments

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:42.120 
flush those fragments away the fragments

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:44.450 
flush those fragments away the fragments
settle<00:00:42.390> back<00:00:42.570> down<00:00:42.629> and<00:00:43.530> then<00:00:43.800> we've<00:00:44.070> got<00:00:44.280> to

00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:44.460 
settle back down and then we've got to

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:47.209 
settle back down and then we've got to
break<00:00:44.700> up<00:00:44.910> the<00:00:45.059> ink<00:00:45.239> again<00:00:45.680> now<00:00:46.680> the<00:00:46.739> business

00:00:47.209 --> 00:00:47.219 
break up the ink again now the business

00:00:47.219 --> 00:00:49.040 
break up the ink again now the business
are<00:00:47.370> typically<00:00:47.789> about<00:00:48.180> four<00:00:48.539> to<00:00:48.690> six<00:00:48.719> weeks

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:49.050 
are typically about four to six weeks

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:52.279 
are typically about four to six weeks
apart<00:00:49.590> and<00:00:49.890> why<00:00:50.399> that<00:00:50.640> is<00:00:50.850> is<00:00:50.879> this<00:00:51.270> is<00:00:51.480> it<00:00:52.170> if

00:00:52.279 --> 00:00:52.289 
apart and why that is is this is it if

00:00:52.289 --> 00:00:54.529 
apart and why that is is this is it if
we<00:00:52.469> saw<00:00:52.710> you<00:00:52.770> every<00:00:53.190> week<00:00:53.460> you'd<00:00:54.149> be<00:00:54.180> wasting

00:00:54.529 --> 00:00:54.539 
we saw you every week you'd be wasting

00:00:54.539 --> 00:00:56.900 
we saw you every week you'd be wasting
your<00:00:54.719> money<00:00:54.960> because<00:00:55.920> we've<00:00:56.280> got<00:00:56.460> to<00:00:56.640> give<00:00:56.760> the

00:00:56.900 --> 00:00:56.910 
your money because we've got to give the

00:00:56.910 --> 00:00:59.240 
your money because we've got to give the
body<00:00:57.149> time<00:00:57.660> to<00:00:57.690> flush<00:00:58.320> the<00:00:58.559> ink<00:00:58.770> fragments

00:00:59.240 --> 00:00:59.250 
body time to flush the ink fragments

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:01.670 
body time to flush the ink fragments
away<00:00:59.460> the<00:01:00.059> laser<00:01:00.329> doesn't<00:01:00.809> really<00:01:00.989> remove<00:01:01.440> the

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:01.680 
away the laser doesn't really remove the

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:04.399 
away the laser doesn't really remove the
ink<00:01:01.890> the<00:01:02.460> laser<00:01:02.730> breaks<00:01:03.239> it<00:01:03.449> up<00:01:03.600> unless<00:01:03.899> the

00:01:04.399 --> 00:01:04.409 
ink the laser breaks it up unless the

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:07.190 
ink the laser breaks it up unless the
body<00:01:04.710> flush<00:01:05.129> it<00:01:05.280> away<00:01:05.369> and<00:01:05.820> so<00:01:06.750> we<00:01:06.840> need<00:01:07.080> to

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:07.200 
body flush it away and so we need to

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:08.899 
body flush it away and so we need to
give<00:01:07.350> the<00:01:07.470> body<00:01:07.680> time<00:01:08.040> to<00:01:08.070> flush<00:01:08.430> this<00:01:08.670> ink

00:01:08.899 --> 00:01:08.909 
give the body time to flush this ink

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:11.570 
give the body time to flush this ink
away<00:01:09.150> the<00:01:09.869> other<00:01:10.020> reason<00:01:10.530> is<00:01:10.650> that<00:01:11.040> the<00:01:11.369> area

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:11.580 
away the other reason is that the area

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:14.780 
away the other reason is that the area
we<00:01:12.000> use<00:01:12.210> the<00:01:12.360> laser<00:01:12.900> on<00:01:13.229> afterwards<00:01:13.890> will<00:01:14.640> be

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:14.790 
we use the laser on afterwards will be

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:17.270 
we use the laser on afterwards will be
like<00:01:14.970> I<00:01:15.000> had<00:01:15.210> a<00:01:15.240> son<00:01:15.570> birth<00:01:15.810> and<00:01:16.049> if<00:01:16.740> we<00:01:17.100> have<00:01:17.250> a

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:17.280 
like I had a son birth and if we have a

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:19.399 
like I had a son birth and if we have a
sunburn<00:01:17.640> we<00:01:18.270> want<00:01:18.479> to<00:01:18.570> let<00:01:18.689> that<00:01:18.900> sunburn

00:01:19.399 --> 00:01:19.409 
sunburn we want to let that sunburn

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:22.370 
sunburn we want to let that sunburn
he'll<00:01:19.770> totally<00:01:20.250> before<00:01:20.939> we<00:01:21.150> put<00:01:22.140> another

00:01:22.370 --> 00:01:22.380 
he'll totally before we put another

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:24.590 
he'll totally before we put another
sunburn<00:01:22.740> on<00:01:23.009> it<00:01:23.189> and<00:01:23.310> so<00:01:24.030> for<00:01:24.210> those<00:01:24.330> two

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:24.600 
sunburn on it and so for those two

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:27.080 
sunburn on it and so for those two
reasons<00:01:25.080> we<00:01:25.229> wait<00:01:25.470> the<00:01:25.799> time<00:01:26.070> between<00:01:26.310> which

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:27.090 
reasons we wait the time between which

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:29.260 
reasons we wait the time between which
is<00:01:27.240> typically<00:01:27.659> between<00:01:27.840> four<00:01:28.290> and<00:01:28.320> six<00:01:28.619> weeks

00:01:29.260 --> 00:01:29.270 
is typically between four and six weeks

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:31.399 
is typically between four and six weeks
