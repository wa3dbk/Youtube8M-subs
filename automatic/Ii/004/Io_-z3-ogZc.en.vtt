for those it comes to that yikes and got
the<00:02:33.750> accessory<00:02:34.750> mount<00:02:34.930> bushings<00:02:35.080> I<00:02:35.350> got<00:02:35.500> six

00:02:35.820 --> 00:02:35.830 
the accessory mount bushings I got six

00:02:35.830 --> 00:02:41.190 
the accessory mount bushings I got six
of<00:02:35.980> the<00:02:36.100> polyurethane<00:02:36.430> ones<00:02:37.090> I<00:02:37.210> was<00:02:40.200> wondering

00:02:41.190 --> 00:02:41.200 
of the polyurethane ones I was wondering

00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:42.630 
of the polyurethane ones I was wondering
if<00:02:41.320> there<00:02:41.470> was<00:02:41.590> just<00:02:41.830> six<00:02:42.100> I<00:02:42.250> suppose<00:02:42.430> I<00:02:42.520> should

00:02:42.630 --> 00:02:42.640 
if there was just six I suppose I should

00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:44.180 
if there was just six I suppose I should
just<00:02:42.730> take<00:02:42.850> the<00:02:43.000> time<00:02:43.150> and<00:02:43.300> look<00:02:43.450> but<00:02:43.750> I

00:02:44.180 --> 00:02:44.190 
just take the time and look but I

00:02:44.190 --> 00:02:46.500 
just take the time and look but I
ordered<00:02:45.190> six<00:02:45.370> of<00:02:45.580> the<00:02:45.670> polyurethane<00:02:45.940> and<00:02:46.330> then

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:46.510 
ordered six of the polyurethane and then

00:02:46.510 --> 00:02:48.510 
ordered six of the polyurethane and then
I<00:02:46.600> got<00:02:46.750> two<00:02:46.930> of<00:02:47.050> the<00:02:47.170> rubber<00:02:47.350> ones<00:02:47.650> in<00:02:48.070> stock

00:02:48.510 --> 00:02:48.520 
I got two of the rubber ones in stock

00:02:48.520 --> 00:02:52.350 
I got two of the rubber ones in stock
already<00:02:48.850> so<00:02:50.400> should<00:02:51.400> be<00:02:51.430> enough<00:02:51.790> there<00:02:52.060> eight

00:02:52.350 --> 00:02:52.360 
already so should be enough there eight

00:02:52.360 --> 00:02:57.290 
already so should be enough there eight

00:05:12.219 --> 00:05:12.229 
to check out such as which harmonic

00:05:12.229 --> 00:05:14.950 
to check out such as which harmonic
balancer<00:05:12.650> to<00:05:12.680> use<00:05:13.009> and<00:05:13.539> wanted<00:05:14.539> to<00:05:14.599> swap<00:05:14.810> out

00:05:14.950 --> 00:05:14.960 
balancer to use and wanted to swap out

00:05:14.960 --> 00:05:17.769 
balancer to use and wanted to swap out
the<00:05:15.080> alternator<00:05:15.440> and<00:05:15.529> the<00:05:15.710> starter<00:05:16.009> also<00:05:16.779> and

00:05:17.769 --> 00:05:17.779 
the alternator and the starter also and

00:05:17.779 --> 00:05:20.189 
the alternator and the starter also and
probably<00:05:17.900> all<00:05:18.199> those<00:05:18.319> plane<00:05:18.529> trap<00:05:18.830> hoses<00:05:19.340> but

00:05:20.189 --> 00:05:20.199 
probably all those plane trap hoses but

00:05:20.199 --> 00:05:23.490 
probably all those plane trap hoses but
we<00:05:21.199> can<00:05:21.529> talk<00:05:21.710> about<00:05:21.949> that<00:05:22.340> later

00:05:23.490 --> 00:05:23.500 
we can talk about that later

00:05:23.500 --> 00:05:27.670 
we can talk about that later
so<00:05:24.500> there<00:05:24.650> it<00:05:24.710> is<00:05:25.360> the<00:05:26.360> video<00:05:26.690> for<00:05:27.110> 4th<00:05:27.469> Street
