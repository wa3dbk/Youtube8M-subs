00:01:15.410 --> 00:01:15.420 
here just feels kind of boring and a

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:17.420 
here just feels kind of boring and a
purple<00:01:15.810> giant<00:01:16.259> and<00:01:16.380> a<00:01:16.409> giant<00:01:16.650> purple<00:01:17.040> dinosaur

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:23.600 
with a metal head should not feel boring
anyway<00:01:20.850> so<00:01:21.570> overall<00:01:21.930> it's<00:01:22.320> not<00:01:22.740> that<00:01:23.009> great<00:01:23.369> of

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:23.610 
anyway so overall it's not that great of

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:25.999 
anyway so overall it's not that great of
a<00:01:23.700> toy<00:01:23.970> because<00:01:24.600> you<00:01:24.810> really<00:01:25.080> can't<00:01:25.350> pose<00:01:25.710> him

00:01:25.999 --> 00:01:26.009

a toy because you really can't pose him
that<00:01:26.220> much<00:01:26.540> his<00:01:27.540> arms<00:01:27.930> do<00:01:28.170> have<00:01:28.530> poseability

00:01:29.359 --> 00:01:29.369 
that much his arms do have poseability

00:01:29.369 --> 00:01:31.789 
that much his arms do have poseability
his<00:01:29.790> legs<00:01:30.119> do<00:01:30.360> impose<00:01:30.689> ability<00:01:31.170> but<00:01:31.350> he<00:01:31.530> can't

00:01:31.789 --> 00:01:31.799 
his legs do impose ability but he can't

00:01:31.799 --> 00:01:34.580 
his legs do impose ability but he can't
bring<00:01:32.040> the<00:01:32.189> legs<00:01:32.430> forward<00:01:33.420> enough<00:01:33.900> like<00:01:34.229> this

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:34.590 
bring the legs forward enough like this

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:37.039 
bring the legs forward enough like this
so<00:01:35.009> that<00:01:35.159> he<00:01:35.189> can<00:01:35.460> stand<00:01:35.909> and<00:01:36.360> look<00:01:36.810> menacing

00:01:37.039 --> 00:01:37.049 
so that he can stand and look menacing

00:01:37.049 --> 00:01:39.859 
so that he can stand and look menacing
he<00:01:37.560> just<00:01:37.770> kind<00:01:37.950> of<00:01:38.009> keeps<00:01:38.189> looking<00:01:39.119> up<00:01:39.329> to<00:01:39.750> the

00:01:39.859 --> 00:01:39.869

00:01:39.869 --> 00:01:43.160 
he just kind of keeps looking up to the
sky<00:01:40.079> and<00:01:40.740> then<00:01:41.549> you<00:01:41.579> have<00:01:41.970> to<00:01:42.090> really<00:01:42.540> bring

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:43.170 
sky and then you have to really bring

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:46.280 
sky and then you have to really bring
his<00:01:43.530> legs<00:01:43.770> forward<00:01:44.549> in<00:01:45.090> order<00:01:45.420> to<00:01:45.509> get<00:01:45.689> I<00:01:45.930> don't

know even a mild dinosaur look to him so

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:52.490 
know even a mild dinosaur look to him so
overall<00:01:50.250> he's<00:01:50.610> not<00:01:50.939> great<00:01:51.509> his<00:01:51.780> mouth<00:01:52.049> can

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:52.500
