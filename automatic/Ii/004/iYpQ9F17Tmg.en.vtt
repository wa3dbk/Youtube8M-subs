00:00:17.029 --> 00:00:17.039 
cPanel works that we actually installed

00:00:17.039 --> 00:00:18.800 
cPanel works that we actually installed
WordPress<00:00:17.460> on<00:00:17.609> your<00:00:17.640> website<00:00:18.119> and<00:00:18.300> just<00:00:18.720> a

very simple nothing has been changed to

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:27.980 
very simple nothing has been changed to
it<00:00:26.010> just<00:00:26.130> a<00:00:26.279> default<00:00:26.580> template<00:00:27.300> of<00:00:27.449> WordPress

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:27.990

so<00:00:28.529> in<00:00:28.680> this<00:00:28.830> lesson<00:00:29.039> we're<00:00:29.429> going<00:00:29.550> to<00:00:29.609> be

00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:29.670 
so in this lesson we're going to be

00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:33.570 
and that's where we're gonna be editing

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:36.260 
and that's where we're gonna be editing
our<00:00:33.809> WordPress<00:00:34.320> website<00:00:34.350> in<00:00:35.070> just<00:00:35.910> a<00:00:36.000> very

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:36.270 
our WordPress website in just a very

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:37.819 
our WordPress website in just a very
quick<00:00:36.480> overview<00:00:36.719> of<00:00:37.140> what<00:00:37.380> we're<00:00:37.500> gonna<00:00:37.590> learn

00:00:37.819 --> 00:00:37.829 
quick overview of what we're gonna learn

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:39.590 
quick overview of what we're gonna learn
in<00:00:38.040> this<00:00:38.190> lesson<00:00:38.430> is<00:00:38.879> we're<00:00:39.329> going<00:00:39.450> to<00:00:39.510> learn

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:39.600 
in this lesson is we're going to learn

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:41.389 
in this lesson is we're going to learn
about<00:00:39.750> the<00:00:39.989> front-end<00:00:40.410> risk<00:00:40.710> the<00:00:40.860> backend<00:00:41.250> and

00:00:41.389 --> 00:00:41.399 
about the front-end risk the backend and

00:00:41.399 --> 00:00:42.950 
about the front-end risk the backend and
this<00:00:41.520> is<00:00:41.670> just<00:00:41.850> terminology<00:00:42.510> that<00:00:42.540> we<00:00:42.719> kind<00:00:42.930> of

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:42.960 
this is just terminology that we kind of

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:44.720 
this is just terminology that we kind of
have<00:00:43.110> to<00:00:43.140> get<00:00:43.379> squared<00:00:43.680> away<00:00:43.739> and<00:00:44.129> we're<00:00:44.610> also

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:44.730 
have to get squared away and we're also

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:46.010 
have to get squared away and we're also
going<00:00:44.879> to<00:00:44.940> be<00:00:45.030> taking<00:00:45.329> a<00:00:45.390> quick<00:00:45.539> tour<00:00:45.840> of<00:00:45.870> the

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:46.020 
going to be taking a quick tour of the

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:47.750 
going to be taking a quick tour of the
dashboard<00:00:46.590> and<00:00:46.770> so<00:00:47.219> the<00:00:47.309> first<00:00:47.520> thing<00:00:47.670> we're

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:47.760 
dashboard and so the first thing we're

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:49.040 
dashboard and so the first thing we're
talking<00:00:48.000> about<00:00:48.180> is<00:00:48.450> what's<00:00:48.870> the<00:00:48.930> difference

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:49.050 
talking about is what's the difference

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:50.840 
talking about is what's the difference
between<00:00:49.260> the<00:00:49.440> front-end<00:00:49.860> risk<00:00:50.309> the<00:00:50.430> backend

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:50.850 
between the front-end risk the backend

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:53.330 
between the front-end risk the backend
and<00:00:51.030> put<00:00:51.449> very<00:00:51.690> simply<00:00:51.930> the<00:00:52.710> front-end<00:00:53.160> is

00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:53.340 
and put very simply the front-end is

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:56.510 
and put very simply the front-end is
what<00:00:53.520> users<00:00:53.940> see<00:00:53.969> it's<00:00:54.629> at<00:00:54.870> your<00:00:55.379> domain<00:00:55.860> calm

00:00:56.510 --> 00:00:56.520 
what users see it's at your domain calm

00:00:56.520 --> 00:01:00.380 
what users see it's at your domain calm
so<00:00:56.940> for<00:00:57.120> example<00:00:57.510> WP<00:00:58.199> for<00:00:58.440> all<00:00:58.500> TV<00:00:59.190> com<00:00:59.699> is<00:00:59.940> the

00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:00.390 
so for example WP for all TV com is the

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:02.410 
so for example WP for all TV com is the
front<00:01:00.600> end<00:01:00.750> it's<00:01:00.899> what<00:01:01.020> users<00:01:01.410> actually<00:01:01.859> see

00:01:02.410 --> 00:01:02.420 
front end it's what users actually see

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:04.670 
front end it's what users actually see
versus<00:01:03.420> the<00:01:03.539> back<00:01:03.780> end<00:01:04.049> that's<00:01:04.409> what<00:01:04.589> the

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:04.680 
versus the back end that's what the

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:06.890 
versus the back end that's what the
admin<00:01:05.159> sees<00:01:05.430> or<00:01:05.670> what<00:01:05.850> the<00:01:06.030> editor<00:01:06.689> of<00:01:06.720> the

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:06.900 
admin sees or what the editor of the

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:08.990 
admin sees or what the editor of the
website<00:01:07.020> like<00:01:07.439> us<00:01:07.619> will<00:01:07.920> see<00:01:08.130> and<00:01:08.369> it's<00:01:08.850> where

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:09.000 
website like us will see and it's where

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:10.460 
website like us will see and it's where
all<00:01:09.030> the<00:01:09.270> edits<00:01:09.600> and<00:01:09.780> the<00:01:09.840> changes<00:01:10.170> are<00:01:10.290> made

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:10.470 
all the edits and the changes are made

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:12.859 
all the edits and the changes are made
and<00:01:10.710> it<00:01:11.130> will<00:01:11.220> be<00:01:11.310> accessed<00:01:11.909> at<00:01:12.180> your<00:01:12.510> domain

00:01:12.859 --> 00:01:12.869 
and it will be accessed at your domain

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:16.700 
and it will be accessed at your domain
comm<00:01:13.380> slash<00:01:14.659> wp-admin<00:01:15.720> and<00:01:15.869> that's<00:01:16.140> Universal

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:16.710 
comm slash wp-admin and that's Universal

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:18.950 
comm slash wp-admin and that's Universal
for<00:01:16.860> all<00:01:16.950> web<00:01:17.159> sites<00:01:17.420> and<00:01:18.420> we'll<00:01:18.570> take<00:01:18.689> a<00:01:18.750> look

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:18.960 
for all web sites and we'll take a look

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:20.660 
for all web sites and we'll take a look
at<00:01:19.110> how<00:01:19.350> to<00:01:19.409> actually<00:01:19.560> access<00:01:19.770> this<00:01:20.250> back<00:01:20.460> in

00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:20.670 
at how to actually access this back in

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:22.910 
at how to actually access this back in
and<00:01:20.880> this<00:01:21.240> back<00:01:21.479> end<00:01:21.720> is<00:01:21.900> also<00:01:22.320> called<00:01:22.590> the

00:01:22.910 --> 00:01:22.920 
and this back end is also called the

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:24.260 
and this back end is also called the
dashboard<00:01:23.159> it's<00:01:23.580> where<00:01:23.700> we<00:01:23.790> access<00:01:24.119> the

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:24.270 
dashboard it's where we access the

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:26.660 
dashboard it's where we access the
dashboard<00:01:25.070> so<00:01:26.070> now<00:01:26.220> that<00:01:26.280> we<00:01:26.460> have<00:01:26.580> this

00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:26.670 
dashboard so now that we have this

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:28.370 
dashboard so now that we have this
terminology<00:01:27.119> squared<00:01:27.600> away<00:01:27.720> how<00:01:28.200> do<00:01:28.259> we

00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:28.380 
terminology squared away how do we

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:30.410 
terminology squared away how do we
actually<00:01:28.680> access<00:01:29.250> the<00:01:29.400> dashboard<00:01:29.970> or<00:01:30.119> the

00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:30.420 
actually access the dashboard or the

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:32.270 
actually access the dashboard or the
backend<00:01:30.990> of<00:01:31.079> WordPress<00:01:31.140> to<00:01:31.860> our<00:01:31.950> WordPress

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:32.280 
backend of WordPress to our WordPress

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:34.370 
backend of WordPress to our WordPress
website<00:01:32.759> and<00:01:32.909> so<00:01:33.540> if<00:01:33.600> we<00:01:33.689> recall<00:01:33.990> from<00:01:34.049> the

00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:34.380 
website and so if we recall from the

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:36.410 
website and so if we recall from the
previous<00:01:34.920> lesson<00:01:35.159> when<00:01:36.090> we<00:01:36.119> actually

00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:36.420 
previous lesson when we actually

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:38.480 
previous lesson when we actually
installed<00:01:37.170> WordPress<00:01:37.740> I<00:01:37.920> told<00:01:38.100> you<00:01:38.189> to<00:01:38.280> hold

00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:38.490 
installed WordPress I told you to hold

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:39.770 
installed WordPress I told you to hold
on<00:01:38.610> to<00:01:38.759> a<00:01:38.790> couple<00:01:39.119> things<00:01:39.240> which<00:01:39.450> was<00:01:39.630> your

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:39.780 
on to a couple things which was your

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:42.620 
on to a couple things which was your
admin<00:01:40.290> area<00:01:40.470> URL<00:01:41.189> your<00:01:41.850> username<00:01:42.360> and<00:01:42.540> your
