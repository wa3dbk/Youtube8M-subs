 no no no 

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:49.630
 coxofemoral joint 

00:00:46.930 --> 00:00:51.480
 called also articulation of the 

00:00:49.630 --> 00:00:55.110
 hip 

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:58.230
 its functions are to guide the member 

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:59.740
 lower in all directions give 

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:02.510
 stability 

00:00:59.740 --> 00:01:05.509
 and support body weight 

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:07.740
 and of course that is fundamental in the 

00:01:05.509 --> 00:01:11.250
 locomotion 

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:13.259
 the coxofemoral joint establishes the 

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:15.649
 union between the femur and the bone of the 

00:01:13.259 --> 00:01:15.649
 causal 

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:22.420
 through the head of the femur and the 

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:22.420
 acetabulum of the pelvic bone 

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:31.409
 --classification is a joint 

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:34.470
 synovial type of fair and multi axial 

00:01:31.409 --> 00:01:37.649
 of ball and hollow is of the type of 

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:41.490
 arthrosis is to say that it is completely 

00:01:37.649 --> 00:01:44.399
 mobile within it belongs to the genre 

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:46.740
 of arthrosis in this joint 

00:01:44.399 --> 00:01:49.380
 constitutes the most perfect type of 

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:52.619
 in osteoarthritis along with the joint 

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:55.189
 of the shoulder joining the trunk with the 

00:01:52.619 --> 00:01:55.189
 lower extremity 

00:01:57.350 --> 00:02:02.070
 joint surfaces 

00:01:59.760 --> 00:02:07.340
 this joint has two surfaces 

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:07.340
 joint that are the femoral head 

00:02:07.659 --> 00:02:14.220
 and the cream facet of the zeta 

00:02:10.820 --> 00:02:17.830
 coated with articular cartilage that 

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:20.200
 Later we will mention them 

00:02:17.830 --> 00:02:22.960
 the acetabulum presents a part 

00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:25.330
 crescent - shaped joint a 

00:02:22.960 --> 00:02:27.460
 non- articulate part that is the background 

00:02:25.330 --> 00:02:30.970
 of the cavity 

00:02:27.460 --> 00:02:33.120
 This cavity is spherical where it houses the 

00:02:30.970 --> 00:02:36.030
 femoral head 

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:38.390
 the articular cartilage filter just over 

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:43.300
 the semi lunar surface 

00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:43.300
 the background is filled with more adipose 

00:02:44.190 --> 00:02:50.520
 the femoral head has a surface 

00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:52.150
 convex smooth and corresponds to two thirds 

00:02:50.520 --> 00:02:54.849
 of sphere 

00:02:52.150 --> 00:02:57.410
 in its center presents the appointment of 

00:02:54.849 --> 00:03:00.050
 round ligament 

00:02:57.410 --> 00:03:03.650
 This is covered by fiber or 

00:03:00.050 --> 00:03:06.230
 intrarticular cartilage even though 

00:03:03.650 --> 00:03:08.050
 the acetabulum is concave and fits 

00:03:06.230 --> 00:03:10.970
 properly with the femoral head 

00:03:08.050 --> 00:03:14.330
 there is a grosse tabula that 

00:03:10.970 --> 00:03:16.100
 inserted into the flange to allow a 

00:03:14.330 --> 00:03:18.280
 Greater lace and stability of the 

00:03:16.100 --> 00:03:18.280
 joint 

00:03:28.700 --> 00:03:33.650
 which is inserted around the cavity 

00:03:31.220 --> 00:03:36.170
 continuous and increasing his 

00:03:33.650 --> 00:03:39.819
 depth to allow better 

00:03:36.170 --> 00:03:39.819
 congruence with the femoral head 

00:03:40.790 --> 00:03:46.819
 some of its features are is a 

00:03:44.450 --> 00:03:48.799
 fibrous sleeve that is inserted into the 

00:03:46.819 --> 00:03:52.900
 first perimeter of the cotino cavity 

00:03:48.799 --> 00:03:52.900
 idea and in the neck of the femur 

00:03:53.290 --> 00:04:00.780
 serves as an extension and containment and 

00:03:57.040 --> 00:04:00.780
 firmness for the joint 

00:04:01.890 --> 00:04:09.220
 It is upholstered by a synovium 

00:04:05.980 --> 00:04:12.489
 It is strong and very thick because its function 

00:04:09.220 --> 00:04:15.299
 is stability comes to have a 

00:04:12.489 --> 00:04:15.299
 centimeter thick 

00:04:16.340 --> 00:04:22.079
 It also has three faces or thickenings 

00:04:19.400 --> 00:04:25.020
 longitudinal 

00:04:22.079 --> 00:04:27.740
 an adherent through which it is inserted 

00:04:25.020 --> 00:04:31.340
 the cotino eyebrow and you will see 

00:04:27.740 --> 00:04:34.370
 another internal joint that increases 

00:04:31.340 --> 00:04:37.400
 curvature of the cavity 

00:04:34.370 --> 00:04:39.910
 and a peripheral where the 

00:04:37.400 --> 00:04:39.910
 joint capsule 

00:04:40.320 --> 00:04:45.479
 ligaments within the ligaments 

00:04:42.729 --> 00:04:48.729
 capsular is we have the web ligament 

00:04:45.479 --> 00:04:51.050
 called annular because it surrounds the cuff 

00:04:48.729 --> 00:04:53.750
 of the joint capsule 

00:04:51.050 --> 00:04:56.300
 then in the reinforcement ligaments 

00:04:53.750 --> 00:05:00.610
 we have three ligaments that are 

00:04:56.300 --> 00:05:00.610
 intrinsic these are 

00:05:00.890 --> 00:05:06.750
 ligament and femoral ligament the subcontinent 

00:05:04.530 --> 00:05:11.040
 ligament that comes out of the iliac spine 

00:05:06.750 --> 00:05:12.930
 lower antrum of the coxal bone and has 

00:05:11.040 --> 00:05:15.210
 two portions that are inserted in the 

00:05:12.930 --> 00:05:16.630
 inter trochanter line 

00:05:15.210 --> 00:05:19.720
 safe 

00:05:16.630 --> 00:05:21.910
 the top position ovidio preto 

00:05:19.720 --> 00:05:24.640
 above is inserted in front of the 

00:05:21.910 --> 00:05:27.550
 arrogant the older and the lower version 

00:05:24.640 --> 00:05:29.890
 ovidio pedro cantini is inserted by 

00:05:27.550 --> 00:05:33.510
 in front of the child is the 

00:05:29.890 --> 00:05:33.510
 stronger ligament of the human body 

00:05:33.909 --> 00:05:39.889
 ligament could femoral as its name what 

00:05:37.520 --> 00:05:42.830
 indicates leaves the upper branch of the 

00:05:39.889 --> 00:05:45.710
 pubis and inserted slightly below 

00:05:42.830 --> 00:05:48.740
 of the lower portion of the femoral indium 

00:05:45.710 --> 00:05:50.770
 so he handed him to use to give him 

00:05:48.740 --> 00:05:52.750
 appearance of a mushroom 

00:05:50.770 --> 00:05:55.060
 it works as a reinforcement of the part 

00:05:52.750 --> 00:05:58.389
 lower joint this 

00:05:55.060 --> 00:06:02.310
 ligament is weak but contributes to 

00:05:58.389 --> 00:06:02.310
 avoid excessive separation of the thigh 

00:06:02.909 --> 00:06:08.660
 ligament and femoral ski 

00:06:05.870 --> 00:06:12.170
 is located on the back face of the 

00:06:08.660 --> 00:06:14.360
 articulation comes out of the ischium and it 

00:06:12.170 --> 00:06:16.090
 inserted into the acetabulum digital fossa 

00:06:14.360 --> 00:06:20.760
 of football ' 

00:06:16.090 --> 00:06:20.760
 This ligament prevents hyperextension 

00:06:20.880 --> 00:06:26.430
 besides this articulation has a 

00:06:23.850 --> 00:06:30.020
 round ligament or also called 

00:06:26.430 --> 00:06:30.020
 as a femoral head ligament 

00:06:30.440 --> 00:06:36.449
 is to enter the title because to see it there 

00:06:33.710 --> 00:06:39.720
 to open the joint capsule 

00:06:36.449 --> 00:06:42.720
 it is surrounded by synovial membrane 

00:06:39.720 --> 00:06:45.330
 goes from the head of the femur or if it is 

00:06:42.720 --> 00:06:47.340
 of the ligament round to the bottom the 

00:06:45.330 --> 00:06:50.520
 acetabular notch of the incision 

00:06:47.340 --> 00:06:52.530
 could and ccoo 

00:06:50.520 --> 00:06:54.300
 this is the ligament that holds together 

00:06:52.530 --> 00:06:57.449
 the joint 

00:06:54.300 --> 00:07:00.780
 according to the type of movement bending and 

00:06:57.449 --> 00:07:03.330
 extension etc. acquire a position 

00:07:00.780 --> 00:07:06.500
 different but always within the 

00:07:03.330 --> 00:07:06.500
 background leader coti 

00:07:08.100 --> 00:07:13.069
 movements 

00:07:09.860 --> 00:07:16.460
 Flexion extension is done through 

00:07:13.069 --> 00:07:19.150
 of a transverse or horizontal axis and in 

00:07:16.460 --> 00:07:19.150
 a sagittal plane 

00:07:27.150 --> 00:07:35.690
 abduction and adduction is done in a 

00:07:31.020 --> 00:07:35.690
 frontal plane with an anteroposterior axis 

00:07:36.030 --> 00:07:42.210
 Internal and external rotation is done in 

00:07:39.990 --> 00:07:45.050
 a transverse plane on the axis 

00:07:42.210 --> 00:07:48.379
 longitudinal or vertical 

00:07:45.050 --> 00:07:51.879
 The driving cirh combines all the 

00:07:48.379 --> 00:07:51.879
 movements mentioned above
