way<00:02:26.940> now<00:02:27.940> this<00:02:28.150> will<00:02:28.360> all<00:02:28.510> make<00:02:28.720> sense

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:29.410 
way now this will all make sense

00:02:29.410 --> 00:02:33.509

00:02:36.449 --> 00:02:36.459 
messy but don't worry because that's

00:02:36.459 --> 00:02:40.940 
messy but don't worry because that's
about<00:02:36.760> to<00:02:37.090> be<00:02:37.720> hidden<00:02:38.019> by<00:02:38.709> a<00:02:39.299> truckload<00:02:40.299> of
