00:00:06.450 --> 00:00:10.200
 ok friends well let's start with this 

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:11.850
 arpeggio that I had already promised you that 

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:14.610
 I was going to upload it from this very good roll of 

00:00:11.850 --> 00:00:16.230
 one direction story of my life you know 

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:17.460
 than in the tutorial of the chords if 

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:18.779
 they want to know the order of all 

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:20.669
 chords of the roll as they can give 

00:00:18.779 --> 00:00:23.009
 click here in the video I leave a 

00:00:20.669 --> 00:00:25.230
 link to go and check it out 

00:00:23.009 --> 00:00:26.640
 so then let's start before 

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:28.770
 nothing we will understand here in the hand 

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:31.169
 right let's use the thumb the 

00:00:28.770 --> 00:00:36.540
 big toe already know it obviously is 

00:00:31.169 --> 00:00:38.370
 human finger 102 and finger 3 is worth then 

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:40.350
 we already know that we started in a minor 

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:42.510
 in the left hand and in the hand 

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:44.220
 right let's do this with your finger 

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:47.850
 fat the thumb we are going to touch the 

00:00:44.220 --> 00:00:51.550
 fifth string and with the 12 finger touch the 

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:54.250
 third at the same time it's worth 

00:00:51.550 --> 00:00:58.420
 then let's touch the thumb just the 

00:00:54.250 --> 00:01:01.780
 fifth and then the second with the finger 

00:00:58.420 --> 00:01:05.640
 three with your finger two sorry 

00:01:01.780 --> 00:01:10.150
 and again the third with the finger one goes 

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:13.990
 it would be this very slow way together thumb 

00:01:10.150 --> 00:01:17.440
 2 2 second rope finger 1 first agreement 

00:01:13.990 --> 00:01:21.610
 the third after we are going to give again 

00:01:17.440 --> 00:01:23.470
 the thumb alone but in the fifth and 

00:01:21.610 --> 00:01:27.110
 then with finger 3 we are going to touch the 

00:01:23.470 --> 00:01:29.360
 first rope together with the thumb 

00:01:27.110 --> 00:01:32.159
 because after we've played together 

00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:34.679
 these two the first and the fifth 

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:38.280
 let's touch the thumb in the fifth 

00:01:34.679 --> 00:01:40.890
 again and then two on the second finger 

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:42.620
 one in the third and then the thumb another 

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:44.890
 time 

00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:46.790
 okay 

00:01:44.890 --> 00:01:49.600
 i 

00:01:46.790 --> 00:01:49.600
 again 

00:01:51.640 --> 00:01:55.690
 ok then it will play once slow 

00:01:54.159 --> 00:01:57.370
 full later I'll be going up 

00:01:55.690 --> 00:01:59.470
 gradually speed so that 

00:01:57.370 --> 00:02:01.270
 Check how the camera sounds I leave you 

00:01:59.470 --> 00:02:02.830
 a table here you already know down in the 

00:02:01.270 --> 00:02:06.220
 video to be checked by any 

00:02:02.830 --> 00:02:08.760
 doubt then it would be this way 

00:02:06.220 --> 00:02:08.760
 Y 

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:38.280
 in that fast way we go to 

00:02:35.290 --> 00:02:38.280
 next I agreed that it is 2 

00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:44.870
 what does that do ok in that agreement let's go 

00:02:43.310 --> 00:02:48.200
 to change the arpeggio a bit 

00:02:44.870 --> 00:02:51.110
 do it this way first together the 

00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:53.030
 fifth and the fourth the finger one we're going 

00:02:51.110 --> 00:02:56.080
 to climb will not touch the third but 

00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:56.080
 that is going to touch now the fourth 

00:02:57.040 --> 00:03:03.640
 ok all be together fourth fifth then 

00:03:00.969 --> 00:03:05.739
 only the fifth and then with the third finger 

00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:09.430
 with which we had played the first thing 

00:03:05.739 --> 00:03:12.040
 we went up to the rope two that like 

00:03:09.430 --> 00:03:14.470
 everything goes up is to say the hand we upload it 

00:03:12.040 --> 00:03:17.470
 a whole rope goes then we have together 

00:03:14.470 --> 00:03:19.240
 fifth fourth thumb with the third finger the 

00:03:17.470 --> 00:03:23.670
 second 

00:03:19.240 --> 00:03:23.670
 and then with finger two the third 

00:03:24.610 --> 00:03:27.180
 the 

00:03:28.090 --> 00:03:32.879
 and then we touch the thumb again 

00:03:29.980 --> 00:03:32.879
 Just because 

00:03:33.420 --> 00:03:37.130
 and then we are going to make this arrangement 

00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:43.320
 which is the same, we only change the 

00:03:39.930 --> 00:03:45.960
 finger 2 here on the left we put the 

00:03:43.320 --> 00:03:47.790
 finger 3 here and then 4 forgiveness in the 

00:03:45.960 --> 00:03:51.439
 fret 

00:03:47.790 --> 00:03:51.439
 36 of the 4th 

00:04:01.160 --> 00:04:07.180
 ok so is the arpeggio of the whole roll not 

00:04:03.650 --> 00:04:07.180
 is going to play full so the checks 

00:04:43.440 --> 00:04:47.730
 because all the rola goes on base of 

00:04:45.600 --> 00:04:49.940
 arpeggio that then it could be everything 

00:04:47.730 --> 00:04:53.100
 by the arpeggio of the song really 

00:04:49.940 --> 00:04:56.910
 the whole song is based on that arpeggio 

00:04:53.100 --> 00:04:59.190
 then even if the first verse comes out 

00:04:56.910 --> 00:05:00.990
 everything went ok and so to take in 

00:04:59.190 --> 00:05:02.550
 account practice the us do not have 

00:05:00.990 --> 00:05:05.970
 a lot of agility in the right hand 

00:05:02.550 --> 00:05:09.200
 put it very slow, do it very slowly like this 

00:05:05.970 --> 00:05:09.200
 as I do it all of a sudden 

00:05:12.960 --> 00:05:17.669
 ok and waters a little bit with the technique of 

00:05:15.270 --> 00:05:20.280
 the right hand is how to put it is as if 

00:05:17.669 --> 00:05:22.410
 outside a claw like that and when they're 

00:05:20.280 --> 00:05:24.630
 arpeggiated try to make this move 

00:05:22.410 --> 00:05:25.969
 as if they wanted to touch this part of their 

00:05:24.630 --> 00:05:28.380
 hand 

00:05:25.969 --> 00:05:30.070
 as well 

00:05:28.380 --> 00:05:31.810
 Bah 

00:05:30.070 --> 00:05:35.080
 because suddenly I have seen many things 

00:05:31.810 --> 00:05:37.480
 in the room as well as they squeeze you 

00:05:35.080 --> 00:05:41.740
 they make pretty weird then only 

00:05:37.480 --> 00:05:43.900
 is to see if they can see there 

00:05:41.740 --> 00:05:46.200
 as if they wanted to touch this part of the 

00:05:43.900 --> 00:05:46.200
 hand 

00:05:51.540 --> 00:05:54.540
 Y 

00:05:55.210 --> 00:05:57.750
 Y 

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:10.730
 ok and the thumb is like it was not like that 

00:06:07.960 --> 00:06:13.280
 it's like throwing the branches forward 

00:06:10.730 --> 00:06:16.420
 as if they are winnowing something like 

00:06:13.280 --> 00:06:18.410
 section winding forward like this 

00:06:16.420 --> 00:06:22.790
 They know what they want at the beginning or 

00:06:18.410 --> 00:06:26.230
 exaggerated ok that is to say the movement 

00:06:22.790 --> 00:06:26.230
 right thumb 

00:06:36.409 --> 00:06:41.059
 ok then take that into consideration for 

00:06:39.259 --> 00:06:42.139
 improve their technique a bit 

00:06:41.059 --> 00:06:44.119
 right hand 

00:06:42.139 --> 00:06:45.559
 then it would be all that friends then 

00:06:44.119 --> 00:06:47.569
 this for this lesson you already know how to give 

00:06:45.559 --> 00:06:49.129
 like the video if it served them and 

00:06:47.569 --> 00:06:51.080
 share it with all friends of edges 

00:06:49.129 --> 00:06:52.279
 that you like this type of waves and then 

00:06:51.080 --> 00:06:53.749
 you already know here are all the 

00:06:52.279 --> 00:06:55.969
 social networks so that they go and we 

00:06:53.749 --> 00:06:57.979
 continue everywhere and put your 

00:06:55.969 --> 00:07:00.199
 comments your doubts your suggestions and 

00:06:57.979 --> 00:07:01.399
 everything they want is worth then can 

00:07:00.199 --> 00:07:04.360
 be all for this choice not of two 

00:07:01.399 --> 00:07:04.360
 morning chau
