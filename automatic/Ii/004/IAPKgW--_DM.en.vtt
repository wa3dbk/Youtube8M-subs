00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:33.690 
spots for you guys on the map Overlord

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:35.510 
spots for you guys on the map Overlord
now<00:00:34.079> both<00:00:34.320> these<00:00:34.350> spots<00:00:34.829> you<00:00:35.070> can<00:00:35.100> do<00:00:35.370> online

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:35.520 
now both these spots you can do online

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:37.250 
now both these spots you can do online
and<00:00:35.910> they're<00:00:36.030> really<00:00:36.210> really<00:00:36.660> easy<00:00:36.809> to<00:00:37.050> do

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:37.260 
and they're really really easy to do

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:38.990 
and they're really really easy to do
both<00:00:37.739> of<00:00:37.829> them<00:00:37.890> are<00:00:38.070> stripped<00:00:38.430> jumps<00:00:38.760> and<00:00:38.879> they

00:00:38.990 --> 00:00:39.000 
both of them are stripped jumps and they

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:40.369 
both of them are stripped jumps and they
are<00:00:39.180> in<00:00:39.360> pretty<00:00:39.540> much<00:00:39.629> the<00:00:39.780> same<00:00:40.020> part<00:00:40.230> of<00:00:40.290> the

00:00:40.369 --> 00:00:40.379 
are in pretty much the same part of the

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:41.960 
are in pretty much the same part of the
map<00:00:40.559> but<00:00:40.890> they're<00:00:41.070> two<00:00:41.190> different<00:00:41.340> spots<00:00:41.670> and

00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:41.970 
map but they're two different spots and

00:00:41.970 --> 00:00:43.460 
map but they're two different spots and
like<00:00:42.090> I<00:00:42.210> said<00:00:42.270> they're<00:00:42.510> both<00:00:42.629> easy<00:00:42.870> to<00:00:43.079> do<00:00:43.260> and

00:00:43.460 --> 00:00:43.470 
like I said they're both easy to do and

00:00:43.470 --> 00:00:45.170 
like I said they're both easy to do and
you<00:00:43.620> can<00:00:43.770> get<00:00:43.860> a<00:00:43.890> lot<00:00:44.040> of<00:00:44.100> kills<00:00:44.309> with<00:00:44.460> them<00:00:44.610> so

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:45.180 
you can get a lot of kills with them so

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:46.430 
you can get a lot of kills with them so
for<00:00:45.360> this<00:00:45.449> first<00:00:45.510> spot<00:00:45.900> what<00:00:46.050> you<00:00:46.140> want<00:00:46.290> to<00:00:46.350> do

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:46.440 
for this first spot what you want to do

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:47.569 
for this first spot what you want to do
is<00:00:46.559> you<00:00:46.589> want<00:00:46.680> to<00:00:46.830> come<00:00:47.010> to<00:00:47.129> this<00:00:47.220> part<00:00:47.460> of<00:00:47.489> the

00:00:47.569 --> 00:00:47.579 
is you want to come to this part of the

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:49.160 
is you want to come to this part of the
map<00:00:47.760> from<00:00:48.210> there<00:00:48.390> you<00:00:48.480> want<00:00:48.629> to<00:00:48.690> jump<00:00:48.870> up<00:00:49.019> on

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:49.170 
map from there you want to jump up on

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:50.479 
map from there you want to jump up on
top<00:00:49.320> of<00:00:49.379> the<00:00:49.589> car<00:00:49.769> and<00:00:49.980> then<00:00:50.220> you<00:00:50.309> want<00:00:50.430> to

00:00:50.479 --> 00:00:50.489 
top of the car and then you want to

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:52.189 
top of the car and then you want to
strafe<00:00:50.730> jump<00:00:50.760> over<00:00:51.239> to<00:00:51.269> this<00:00:51.480> tree<00:00:51.720> over<00:00:51.989> here

00:00:52.189 --> 00:00:52.199 
strafe jump over to this tree over here

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:53.420 
strafe jump over to this tree over here
and<00:00:52.320> you<00:00:52.589> should<00:00:52.769> be<00:00:52.800> able<00:00:52.980> to<00:00:53.100> land<00:00:53.250> in<00:00:53.370> this

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:53.430 
and you should be able to land in this

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:55.549 
and you should be able to land in this
barrier<00:00:53.760> now<00:00:54.480> be<00:00:54.600> careful<00:00:54.750> you<00:00:55.019> do<00:00:55.260> land<00:00:55.440> in

00:00:55.549 --> 00:00:55.559 
barrier now be careful you do land in

00:00:55.559 --> 00:00:56.810 
barrier now be careful you do land in
this<00:00:55.680> barrier<00:00:55.980> because<00:00:56.250> most<00:00:56.489> of<00:00:56.579> the<00:00:56.670> other

00:00:56.810 --> 00:00:56.820 
this barrier because most of the other

00:00:56.820 --> 00:00:58.910 
this barrier because most of the other
branches<00:00:57.239> on<00:00:57.449> this<00:00:57.629> tree<00:00:57.690> are<00:00:57.870> fake<00:00:58.379> and<00:00:58.559> so<00:00:58.829> if

00:00:58.910 --> 00:00:58.920 
branches on this tree are fake and so if

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:00.079 
branches on this tree are fake and so if
you<00:00:59.010> jump<00:00:59.250> onto<00:00:59.460> them<00:00:59.610> you'll<00:00:59.760> just<00:00:59.940> fall

00:01:00.079 --> 00:01:00.089 
you jump onto them you'll just fall

00:01:00.089 --> 00:01:01.939 
you jump onto them you'll just fall
through<00:01:00.149> now<00:01:00.989> once<00:01:01.199> you<00:01:01.289> land<00:01:01.410> in<00:01:01.649> this<00:01:01.710> tree

00:01:01.939 --> 00:01:01.949 
through now once you land in this tree

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:03.349 
through now once you land in this tree
you<00:01:02.070> have<00:01:02.219> good<00:01:02.399> lines<00:01:02.640> of<00:01:02.820> sites<00:01:03.000> to<00:01:03.180> both

00:01:03.349 --> 00:01:03.359 
you have good lines of sites to both

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:04.999 
you have good lines of sites to both
spawns<00:01:03.750> and<00:01:03.989> if<00:01:04.259> you<00:01:04.320> do<00:01:04.440> have<00:01:04.559> a<00:01:04.619> sniper<00:01:04.860> up

00:01:04.999 --> 00:01:05.009 
spawns and if you do have a sniper up

00:01:05.009 --> 00:01:06.469 
spawns and if you do have a sniper up
here<00:01:05.160> you<00:01:05.280> could<00:01:05.430> it<00:01:05.550> some<00:01:05.820> cool<00:01:05.970> jump<00:01:06.240> shots

00:01:06.469 --> 00:01:06.479 
here you could it some cool jump shots

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:08.450 
here you could it some cool jump shots
and<00:01:06.690> from<00:01:07.229> there<00:01:07.380> you<00:01:07.410> are<00:01:07.800> really<00:01:08.190> good<00:01:08.310> lines

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:08.460 
and from there you are really good lines

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:10.310 
and from there you are really good lines
the<00:01:08.580> sights<00:01:08.820> to<00:01:09.149> over<00:01:09.330> there<00:01:09.539> also<00:01:10.170> in<00:01:10.259> the

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:10.320 
the sights to over there also in the

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:12.200 
the sights to over there also in the
middle<00:01:10.530> of<00:01:10.560> the<00:01:10.680> map<00:01:10.890> and<00:01:11.220> you<00:01:11.250> are<00:01:11.759> really

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:12.210 
middle of the map and you are really

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:13.850 
middle of the map and you are really
really<00:01:12.390> hidden<00:01:12.630> by<00:01:12.869> all<00:01:13.020> these<00:01:13.170> branches<00:01:13.710> and

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:13.860 
really hidden by all these branches and

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:15.620 
really hidden by all these branches and
so<00:01:14.310> it<00:01:14.369> is<00:01:14.429> a<00:01:14.490> really<00:01:14.729> really<00:01:14.970> good<00:01:15.149> spot<00:01:15.390> to<00:01:15.450> do

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:15.630 
so it is a really really good spot to do

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:17.990 
so it is a really really good spot to do
online<00:01:15.860> for<00:01:16.860> the<00:01:16.890> second<00:01:17.310> spot<00:01:17.520> it's<00:01:17.729> in<00:01:17.850> the

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:18.000 
online for the second spot it's in the

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:19.460 
online for the second spot it's in the
pretty<00:01:18.240> much<00:01:18.390> the<00:01:18.479> same<00:01:18.630> part<00:01:18.840> of<00:01:18.869> the<00:01:18.929> map<00:01:19.200> and

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:19.470 
pretty much the same part of the map and

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:20.960 
pretty much the same part of the map and
all<00:01:19.679> you<00:01:19.800> want<00:01:19.979> to<00:01:20.039> do<00:01:20.160> is<00:01:20.280> do<00:01:20.399> another<00:01:20.640> stripe

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:20.970 
all you want to do is do another stripe

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:22.370 
all you want to do is do another stripe
jump<00:01:21.270> and<00:01:21.450> I'll<00:01:21.539> show<00:01:21.720> you<00:01:21.750> that's<00:01:21.929> just<00:01:22.259> in<00:01:22.320> a

00:01:22.370 --> 00:01:22.380 
jump and I'll show you that's just in a

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:24.169 
jump and I'll show you that's just in a
second<00:01:22.679> what<00:01:22.770> you<00:01:22.860> want<00:01:23.009> to<00:01:23.070> do<00:01:23.190> so<00:01:23.789> you<00:01:23.850> want

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:25.350 
to come to the same part of the map and

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:27.320 
to come to the same part of the map and
jump<00:01:25.500> up<00:01:25.590> on<00:01:25.860> top<00:01:26.130> of<00:01:26.280> the<00:01:26.340> same<00:01:26.520> car<00:01:26.789> and<00:01:27.210> from

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:27.330 
jump up on top of the same car and from

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:28.340

there what you want to do is you want to
do<00:01:28.410> a<00:01:28.470> simple<00:01:28.649> strafe<00:01:28.979> jump<00:01:29.009> over<00:01:29.429> to<00:01:29.460> the

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:29.640 
do a simple strafe jump over to the

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:31.249 
do a simple strafe jump over to the
fence<00:01:29.880> you<00:01:30.000> see<00:01:30.119> to<00:01:30.210> my<00:01:30.330> left<00:01:30.360> and<00:01:30.720> once<00:01:31.170> you
