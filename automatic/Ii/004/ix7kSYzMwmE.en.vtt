they were kind of like the bully ones
and<00:02:31.800> they<00:02:31.860> weren't<00:02:32.010> very<00:02:32.190> nice<00:02:32.400> it<00:02:33.000> seemed<00:02:33.150> a

00:02:33.230 --> 00:02:33.240 
and they weren't very nice it seemed a

00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:35.000 
and they weren't very nice it seemed a
bit<00:02:33.360> later<00:02:33.570> and<00:02:33.870> you're<00:02:33.959> just<00:02:34.140> like<00:02:34.320> God<00:02:34.860> they

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:35.010 
bit later and you're just like God they

00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:37.520 
bit later and you're just like God they
really<00:02:35.340> weren't<00:02:35.550> beautiful<00:02:36.000> like<00:02:36.510> at<00:02:36.660> all<00:02:36.870> so

yeah I think it's stronger to just go
with<00:02:39.570> who<00:02:39.690> you<00:02:39.810> are<00:02:39.840> and<00:02:40.110> be<00:02:40.200> yourself<00:02:40.620> and
