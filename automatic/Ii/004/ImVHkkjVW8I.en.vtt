00:01:01.279 --> 00:01:01.289 
this one you can see is a combination of

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:03.529

axis gyro stabilization we've got a

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:08.570 
axis gyro stabilization we've got a
couple<00:01:07.229> of<00:01:07.409> other<00:01:07.560> more<00:01:07.890> advanced<00:01:08.159> ones<00:01:08.369> up

00:01:10.609 --> 00:01:10.619 
here to check out as well this next one

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:12.920 
here to check out as well this next one
is<00:01:10.650> the<00:01:10.860> gyre<00:01:11.400> on<00:01:11.610> this<00:01:11.790> again<00:01:12.150> has<00:01:12.390> five<00:01:12.659> acts

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:12.930 
is the gyre on this again has five acts

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:15.020 
is the gyre on this again has five acts
of<00:01:13.080> stabilization<00:01:13.500> and<00:01:14.100> it<00:01:14.250> actually<00:01:14.460> mounds

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:15.030 
of stabilization and it actually mounds

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:16.490 
of stabilization and it actually mounds
just<00:01:15.240> out<00:01:15.390> of<00:01:15.540> the<00:01:15.630> nose<00:01:15.869> of<00:01:16.110> a<00:01:16.200> helicopter

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:16.500 
just out of the nose of a helicopter

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:19.039 
just out of the nose of a helicopter
it's<00:01:17.430> really<00:01:17.820> lightweight<00:01:18.180> I<00:01:18.479> think<00:01:18.869> this

00:01:19.039 --> 00:01:19.049 
it's really lightweight I think this

00:01:19.049 --> 00:01:21.410 
it's really lightweight I think this
one's<00:01:19.350> a<00:01:19.830> fair<00:01:20.610> bit<00:01:20.729> newer<00:01:20.970> than<00:01:21.150> the<00:01:21.210> other

00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:21.420 
one's a fair bit newer than the other

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:23.030 
one's a fair bit newer than the other
one<00:01:21.509> you<00:01:21.600> can<00:01:21.720> see<00:01:21.750> it<00:01:21.960> actually<00:01:22.080> opens<00:01:22.680> up<00:01:22.830> in

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:23.040 
one you can see it actually opens up in

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:24.560 
one you can see it actually opens up in
here<00:01:23.250> and<00:01:23.280> this<00:01:23.430> one<00:01:23.640> will<00:01:23.790> take<00:01:24.030> things<00:01:24.360> like

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:24.570 
here and this one will take things like

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:27.910 
here and this one will take things like
the<00:01:24.750> red<00:01:24.960> epic<00:01:25.380> and<00:01:25.590> Arya<00:01:26.340> so<00:01:26.850> you<00:01:26.909> can<00:01:27.119> do<00:01:27.240> full

00:01:27.910 --> 00:01:27.920 
the red epic and Arya so you can do full

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:30.880 
the red epic and Arya so you can do full
cinema<00:01:28.920> quality<00:01:29.520> productions<00:01:30.270> with<00:01:30.479> this<00:01:30.630> guy

00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:30.890 
cinema quality productions with this guy

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:33.740 
cinema quality productions with this guy
and<00:01:31.890> it's<00:01:32.250> a<00:01:32.400> much<00:01:32.579> more<00:01:32.850> lightweight<00:01:33.119> units

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:33.750 
and it's a much more lightweight units

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:35.510 
and it's a much more lightweight units
then<00:01:34.020> the<00:01:34.350> next<00:01:34.560> one<00:01:34.799> we're<00:01:34.979> going<00:01:35.100> to<00:01:35.250> look<00:01:35.340> at

00:01:35.510 --> 00:01:35.520 
then the next one we're going to look at

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:37.160 
then the next one we're going to look at
which<00:01:35.759> has<00:01:36.000> only<00:01:36.030> just<00:01:36.390> gotten<00:01:36.780> into<00:01:37.049> the

so<00:02:25.960> you<00:02:26.020> can<00:02:26.110> do<00:02:26.350> your<00:02:26.380> probably<00:02:27.190> anything

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:27.400 
so you can do your probably anything

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:30.420 
so you can do your probably anything
other<00:02:27.700> than<00:02:27.880> imax<00:02:28.360> kind<00:02:28.630> of<00:02:28.750> cameras<00:02:29.190> so<00:02:30.190> this

00:02:57.330 --> 00:02:57.340 
took up just look like six feet away

00:02:57.340 --> 00:02:59.820 
took up just look like six feet away
