00:00:09.919 --> 00:00:09.929 
um this is going to be on the shaders

00:00:09.929 --> 00:00:11.839 
um this is going to be on the shaders
and<00:00:09.960> as<00:00:10.349> you<00:00:10.500> know<00:00:10.650> that<00:00:10.860> shaders<00:00:11.429> had<00:00:11.639> to<00:00:11.730> be

00:00:11.839 --> 00:00:11.849 
and as you know that shaders had to be

00:00:11.849 --> 00:00:16.609 
and as you know that shaders had to be
level<00:00:12.120> 20<00:00:12.450> and<00:00:12.650> my<00:00:13.650> buddy<00:00:13.950> uh<00:00:14.570> Zach<00:00:15.570> AKA<00:00:16.199> kill<00:00:16.590> a

description<00:00:30.060> read<00:00:30.900> anyways<00:00:31.170> guys<00:00:31.439> let's<00:00:31.830> get

00:00:31.999 --> 00:00:32.009 
description read anyways guys let's get

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:34.180 
description read anyways guys let's get
into<00:00:32.219> this<00:00:32.430> this<00:00:32.759> is<00:00:32.910> not<00:00:33.120> the<00:00:33.360> right<00:00:33.540> shader

00:00:34.180 --> 00:00:34.190 
into this this is not the right shader

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:37.549 
into this this is not the right shader
I've<00:00:35.190> put<00:00:35.670> on<00:00:35.700> the<00:00:35.910> wrong<00:00:36.059> one<00:00:36.360> but<00:00:37.200> um<00:00:37.350> it's

00:00:37.549 --> 00:00:37.559 
I've put on the wrong one but um it's

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:41.020 
I've put on the wrong one but um it's
similar<00:00:37.950> to<00:00:38.160> the<00:00:38.550> shader<00:00:38.790> that<00:00:39.030> I<00:00:39.059> have<00:00:39.920> and

00:00:41.020 --> 00:00:41.030 
similar to the shader that I have and

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:43.430 
similar to the shader that I have and
there<00:00:42.030> are<00:00:42.149> two<00:00:42.360> different<00:00:42.719> shaders<00:00:43.050> and<00:00:43.079> they

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:43.440 
there are two different shaders and they

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:45.380 
there are two different shaders and they
are<00:00:43.559> both<00:00:43.680> legendary<00:00:44.370> as<00:00:44.520> you<00:00:44.640> can<00:00:44.789> see<00:00:44.969> here

00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:45.390 
are both legendary as you can see here

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:48.470 
are both legendary as you can see here
you<00:00:45.510> have<00:00:45.690> the<00:00:45.989> double<00:00:46.980> ban<00:00:47.190> chi<00:00:47.489> and<00:00:47.760> you<00:00:48.329> have

00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:48.480 
you have the double ban chi and you have

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:52.939 
you have the double ban chi and you have
the<00:00:48.600> Oracle<00:00:49.050> 99<00:00:49.590> I've<00:00:49.950> half<00:00:50.820> 99<00:00:51.329> let<00:00:52.050> them<00:00:52.230> and

00:00:52.939 --> 00:00:52.949 
the Oracle 99 I've half 99 let them and

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:55.459 
the Oracle 99 I've half 99 let them and
just<00:00:53.190> said<00:00:53.460> it<00:00:53.610> but<00:00:53.820> it<00:00:54.180> makes<00:00:54.840> it<00:00:55.020> to<00:00:55.110> a<00:00:55.140> like

00:00:55.459 --> 00:00:55.469 
just said it but it makes it to a like

00:00:55.469 --> 00:01:00.709 
just said it but it makes it to a like
you<00:00:55.649> dark<00:00:56.309> blue<00:00:56.550> and<00:00:56.940> light<00:00:57.809> grey<00:00:58.289> and<00:00:59.030> it's<00:01:00.030> it

00:01:00.709 --> 00:01:00.719 
you dark blue and light grey and it's it

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:02.599 
you dark blue and light grey and it's it
it's<00:01:01.350> maybe<00:01:01.800> different<00:01:02.100> colors<00:01:02.579> for

00:01:02.599 --> 00:01:02.609 
it's maybe different colors for

00:01:02.609 --> 00:01:07.640 
it's maybe different colors for
different<00:01:03.470> classes<00:01:04.470> um<00:01:05.990> for<00:01:06.990> example<00:01:07.470> this

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:07.650 
different classes um for example this

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:10.760 
different classes um for example this
one<00:01:07.920> is<00:01:08.130> actually<00:01:08.510> gold<00:01:09.510> and<00:01:09.840> blue<00:01:10.080> which<00:01:10.740> is

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:10.770 
one is actually gold and blue which is

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:12.980 
one is actually gold and blue which is
pretty<00:01:11.070> cool<00:01:11.340> and<00:01:11.700> these<00:01:11.880> but<00:01:12.270> you<00:01:12.510> can<00:01:12.720> both

00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:12.990 
pretty cool and these but you can both

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:15.140 
pretty cool and these but you can both
get<00:01:13.320> free<00:01:13.890> without<00:01:14.250> having<00:01:14.760> to<00:01:14.820> pay<00:01:14.850> any

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:15.150 
get free without having to pay any

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:17.899 
get free without having to pay any
glimmer<00:01:15.479> i<00:01:15.750> will<00:01:16.259> put<00:01:16.500> the<00:01:16.740> codes<00:01:17.610> in<00:01:17.850> the

00:01:17.899 --> 00:01:17.909 
glimmer i will put the codes in the

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:22.219 
glimmer i will put the codes in the

that<00:01:22.409> you<00:01:22.560> have<00:01:22.650> to<00:01:22.770> put<00:01:22.950> it<00:01:23.070> in<00:01:23.220> and<00:01:23.460> this<00:01:23.759> is

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:23.970 
that you have to put it in and this is

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:26.359 
that you have to put it in and this is
there's<00:01:24.630> no<00:01:24.960> virus<00:01:25.439> for<00:01:25.710> the<00:01:25.830> side<00:01:26.100> this<00:01:26.310> is

00:01:26.359 --> 00:01:26.369 
there's no virus for the side this is

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:30.499 
there's no virus for the side this is
all<00:01:26.880> made<00:01:27.360> by<00:01:27.390> Bungie<00:01:27.960> and<00:01:29.180> here<00:01:30.180> I'm<00:01:30.299> showing

00:01:30.499 --> 00:01:30.509 
all made by Bungie and here I'm showing

00:01:30.509 --> 00:01:34.609 
all made by Bungie and here I'm showing
you<00:01:30.780> just<00:01:30.930> all<00:01:31.350> the<00:01:31.880> both<00:01:32.880> of<00:01:33.150> the<00:01:33.329> shaders<00:01:34.290> and

00:01:34.609 --> 00:01:34.619 
you just all the both of the shaders and

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:38.330 
you just all the both of the shaders and
what<00:01:35.430> it<00:01:35.520> looks<00:01:35.729> like<00:01:35.970> on<00:01:36.180> me<00:01:36.420> Oh<00:01:36.619> like<00:01:37.619> on<00:01:37.890> the

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:38.340 
what it looks like on me Oh like on the

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:39.859 
what it looks like on me Oh like on the
realistic<00:01:39.090> version<00:01:39.270> instead<00:01:39.630> of<00:01:39.780> the

00:01:39.859 --> 00:01:39.869 
realistic version instead of the

00:01:39.869 --> 00:01:41.990 
realistic version instead of the
inventory<00:01:40.229> I<00:01:41.130> guess<00:01:41.549> you<00:01:41.640> could<00:01:41.759> say<00:01:41.880> it

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:42.000 
inventory I guess you could say it

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:45.740 
inventory I guess you could say it
realistic<00:01:42.390> but<00:01:43.380> um<00:01:43.939> it<00:01:44.939> may<00:01:45.090> be<00:01:45.149> different<00:01:45.600> for

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:45.750 
realistic but um it may be different for

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:47.179 
realistic but um it may be different for
you<00:01:45.810> if<00:01:45.960> you're<00:01:46.079> like<00:01:46.229> a<00:01:46.259> hunter<00:01:46.680> or<00:01:46.710> something

00:01:47.179 --> 00:01:47.189 
you if you're like a hunter or something

00:01:47.189 --> 00:01:48.410 
you if you're like a hunter or something
just<00:01:47.369> depending<00:01:47.729> on<00:01:47.790> what<00:01:47.909> kind<00:01:48.000> of<00:01:48.119> Army<00:01:48.329> you

00:01:48.410 --> 00:01:48.420 
just depending on what kind of Army you

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:50.510 
just depending on what kind of Army you
have<00:01:48.450> it<00:01:48.869> changes<00:01:49.470> all<00:01:49.649> the<00:01:49.860> colors<00:01:50.159> for<00:01:50.369> all

00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:50.520 
have it changes all the colors for all

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:53.569 
have it changes all the colors for all
the<00:01:50.700> in<00:01:50.939> all<00:01:51.600> of<00:01:51.780> the<00:01:51.899> armor<00:01:52.439> and<00:01:52.560> here<00:01:53.220> this<00:01:53.430> is

00:01:53.569 --> 00:01:53.579 
the in all of the armor and here this is

00:01:53.579 --> 00:01:57.410 
the in all of the armor and here this is
where<00:01:53.790> you<00:01:53.970> buy<00:01:54.180> it<00:01:54.240> and<00:01:54.740> so<00:01:56.240> here's<00:01:57.240> some

00:02:01.730 --> 00:02:01.740 
video but I'm just gonna do the shaders

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:04.520 
video but I'm just gonna do the shaders
from<00:02:01.920> now<00:02:02.009> on<00:02:02.219> but<00:02:03.060> um<00:02:03.210> anyways<00:02:04.079> guys<00:02:04.229> I<00:02:04.409> hope
