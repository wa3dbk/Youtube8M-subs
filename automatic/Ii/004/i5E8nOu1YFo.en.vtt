00:00:00.740 --> 00:00:04.670
 hello everyone how are you welcome to a 

00:00:03.169 --> 00:00:06.620
 episode more to kim draw and create that 

00:00:04.670 --> 00:00:08.210
 The milton cor speaks to me and this time what 

00:00:06.620 --> 00:00:10.610
 let's do is draw a drop of 

00:00:08.210 --> 00:00:13.299
 water with realistic appearance a drop that 

00:00:10.610 --> 00:00:15.230
 slides through a wall 

00:00:13.299 --> 00:00:18.130
 So the first thing we do is 

00:00:15.230 --> 00:00:20.300
 prepare the outline of our drop 

00:00:18.130 --> 00:00:22.820
 we realize that the light comes from 

00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:27.380
 left to right of the part 

00:00:22.820 --> 00:00:29.960
 upper left to the right 

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:32.500
 and we started to obscure the part 

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:34.720
 left of the drop 

00:00:32.500 --> 00:00:37.120
 because in the drops of water in the light it 

00:00:34.720 --> 00:00:39.880
 they behave a little differently and 

00:00:37.120 --> 00:00:42.850
 what happens is that where the 

00:00:39.880 --> 00:00:44.559
 light that part generates a shadow and 

00:00:42.850 --> 00:00:48.150
 opposite side that would be the right side 

00:00:44.559 --> 00:00:49.950
 has that side manifests light 

00:00:48.150 --> 00:00:51.930
 we know the background I know you the 

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:53.790
 background with a graphite pencil 

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:55.740
 applying it very gently and in a way 

00:00:53.790 --> 00:00:57.940
 uniform because paper is white and 

00:00:55.740 --> 00:01:00.399
 I need the dark background 

00:00:57.940 --> 00:01:02.379
 very soft in a soft way and 

00:01:00.399 --> 00:01:05.799
 we are propagating it by propagating 

00:01:02.379 --> 00:01:07.659
 and then propagated all the graphite with a 

00:01:05.799 --> 00:01:10.299
 piece of toilet paper or with a 

00:01:07.659 --> 00:01:13.210
 soft napkin that is not cotton 

00:01:10.299 --> 00:01:15.369
 because cotton does not propagate graphite 

00:01:13.210 --> 00:01:18.390
 also how do toilet paper 

00:01:15.369 --> 00:01:18.390
 with a napkin 

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:25.750
 we leave the surface as uniform 

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:25.750
 possible 

00:01:26.550 --> 00:01:31.710
 and we also melted what we have already 

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:35.160
 painted our drop and now 

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:38.360
 reinforce the dark areas again 

00:01:35.160 --> 00:01:38.360
 the shadows 

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:42.140
 reinforce 

00:01:45.400 --> 00:01:49.840
 we do so as gently 

00:01:47.800 --> 00:01:54.310
 possible soft here I am taking with a 

00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:56.990
 textured paper is a medium texture and 

00:01:54.310 --> 00:02:00.290
 the textured paper 

00:01:56.990 --> 00:02:03.229
 it helps a lot to propagate uniformly 

00:02:00.290 --> 00:02:07.479
 the graphite the graphite in very papers 

00:02:03.229 --> 00:02:07.479
 smooth is more difficult to turn it off 

00:02:08.830 --> 00:02:17.380
 here generated the shadow on the left 

00:02:11.530 --> 00:02:18.660
 generating drop and let the list 

00:02:17.380 --> 00:02:20.550
 light 

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:23.340
 where the light will escape in the 

00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:24.980
 bottom right because the light is going 

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:27.450
 enter through the upper left 

00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:29.490
 just on the left side I know 

00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:31.650
 manifest with a simply a point 

00:02:29.490 --> 00:02:36.930
 where light comes in, that's the only thing 

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:40.050
 that looks from the light and the light comes out in it 

00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:42.900
 with greater strength in the part on the side 

00:02:40.050 --> 00:02:46.310
 otherwise then gently 

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:46.310
 here I am using 

00:02:47.630 --> 00:02:54.550
 reinforcing with the graphite pencil 

00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:56.920
 to accentuate the shades more 

00:02:54.550 --> 00:03:00.360
 blacks statizing a colored pencil 

00:02:56.920 --> 00:03:02.700
 prismacolor premier 

00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:04.890
 black color or that is the track 

00:03:02.700 --> 00:03:07.140
 premier primaries is very very very 

00:03:04.890 --> 00:03:09.390
 special and used a lot for this 

00:03:07.140 --> 00:03:12.150
 type of jobs 

00:03:09.390 --> 00:03:14.610
 now I start to give it a little bit of shape 

00:03:12.150 --> 00:03:16.600
 to light with the help of the draft 

00:03:14.610 --> 00:03:19.530
 deformable 

00:03:16.600 --> 00:03:19.530
 I'm erasing 

00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:27.959
 very gently I try that the 

00:03:25.439 --> 00:03:31.210
 transition of light and shadows be 

00:03:27.959 --> 00:03:34.150
 as smooth as possible 

00:03:31.210 --> 00:03:36.450
 helped me with a roll of the roll combo 

00:03:34.150 --> 00:03:36.450
 cream 

00:03:38.920 --> 00:03:45.930
 and now we are going to reinforce that light with a 

00:03:42.849 --> 00:03:45.930
 white charcoal 

00:03:46.230 --> 00:03:50.510
 or also for that effect you can 

00:03:48.390 --> 00:03:53.510
 also use a pastel pencil 

00:03:50.510 --> 00:03:53.510
 White 

00:03:56.480 --> 00:04:01.069
 we leave the lights 

00:03:58.790 --> 00:04:03.409
 we melted it 

00:04:01.069 --> 00:04:06.189
 with the graphite so that it is the most 

00:04:03.409 --> 00:04:06.189
 uniform possible 

00:04:07.970 --> 00:04:13.480
 now if we go to realize the light by 

00:04:11.120 --> 00:04:17.120
 where the light enters on the left side 

00:04:13.480 --> 00:04:20.380
 and finally we reinforce the light with a 

00:04:17.120 --> 00:04:20.380
 little acrylic paint 

00:04:20.400 --> 00:04:25.380
 and there is the final result I hope that 

00:04:23.820 --> 00:04:27.720
 you liked it, thanks for watching the video 

00:04:25.380 --> 00:04:30.210
 Please share what please give 

00:04:27.720 --> 00:04:32.880
 like and please subscribe if we see each other 

00:04:30.210 --> 00:04:34.320
 in the next with more tutorials I hope 

00:04:32.880 --> 00:04:37.009
 have a great time we see the 

00:04:34.320 --> 00:04:37.009
 next chau
