web pages youtube videos and shows and
channels<00:01:43.409> that<00:01:43.530> I<00:01:43.619> could<00:01:43.770> actually<00:01:43.890> go<00:01:44.220> to<00:01:44.280> on

00:01:44.539 --> 00:01:44.549

the<00:01:44.640> system<00:01:45.030> and<00:01:45.180> again<00:01:45.509> because<00:01:45.840> we<00:01:45.869> can

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:46.140 
the system and again because we can

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:47.359 
the system and again because we can
control<00:01:46.560> those<00:01:46.680> other<00:01:46.860> elements<00:01:47.280> in<00:01:47.340> your

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:49.170 
stack it will actually go to the right

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:52.910 
stack it will actually go to the right
