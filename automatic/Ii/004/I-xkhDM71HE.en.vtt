00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:06.870
 hello how can you very easily 

00:00:04.290 --> 00:00:09.719
 hard drive of a virtual machine 

00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:11.010
 enlarge there are two steps 

00:00:09.719 --> 00:00:14.759
 required 

00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:17.340
 The first is to use the virtual machine 

00:00:14.759 --> 00:00:20.250
 to close yourself with the start and 

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:23.220
 exit so that you end up in this screen 

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:25.500
 come what you see here where you have one 

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:30.060
 possibility power turmoil again perfume 

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:32.669
 machine and edit error see it settings 

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:38.280
 this virtual machine I go here 

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:41.430
 edit and then we go to the hard disk 

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:43.879
 then to the utilities and we 

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:48.840
 opt for ex pant 

00:00:43.879 --> 00:00:52.140
 and then you can do a new here 

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:58.800
 enter new size of hard disk and 

00:00:52.140 --> 00:01:01.590
 I'll make it 52 and click on expert 

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:07.049
 he is busy for a moment and then late 

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:10.530
 He see a report that this is ready 

00:01:07.049 --> 00:01:10.979
 is just that you are in the gas open rating 

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:13.700
 system 

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:16.710
 also that hard disk must enlarge 

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:18.979
 and that is what I will leave next 

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:18.979
 see 

00:01:22.040 --> 00:01:25.400
 when it has finished enlarging 

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:27.650
 the partition 

00:01:25.400 --> 00:01:32.210
 He reports that the gas open rating system 

00:01:27.650 --> 00:01:34.520
 the disc must also be expanded 

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:38.330
 ok those clicks away 

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:42.440
 we click ok here and we see here 

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:45.770
 so that earth is bigger 52 gigabytes is we 

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:50.660
 now start the virtual machine and 

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:53.840
 if it has started then we will enter the 

00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:56.869
 explorer we are going to see how the 

00:01:53.840 --> 00:02:00.979
 size of the virtual machine is and 

00:01:56.869 --> 00:02:05.290
 then we go using 

00:02:00.979 --> 00:02:05.290
 disk management we will increase this 

00:02:06.650 --> 00:02:12.740
 when the virtual machine is started 

00:02:08.450 --> 00:02:17.320
 let's first look at the scout 

00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:17.320
 to see what our disk size is 

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:25.590
 it remains here to be 39.9 gigabytes 

00:02:23.820 --> 00:02:27.450
 even the previous one 

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:28.860
 magnification I did not have here yet 

00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:32.130
 implemented 

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:35.090
 so we have to go to the tail now 

00:02:32.130 --> 00:02:35.090
 right mouse button 

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:47.010
 sorry for the start left mouse button and 

00:02:43.950 --> 00:02:49.940
 then right click on computer 

00:02:47.010 --> 00:02:49.940
 we are going to manage that 

00:03:01.230 --> 00:03:04.890
 at the management screen we click 

00:03:03.450 --> 00:03:07.590
 disk management 

00:03:04.890 --> 00:03:09.510
 it takes a while before it is late 

00:03:07.590 --> 00:03:10.590
 see which discs to be and we see 

00:03:09.510 --> 00:03:14.099
 here indeed 

00:03:10.590 --> 00:03:15.780
 40 gigabytes and 12 not allocated 

00:03:14.099 --> 00:03:17.129
 we make sure the disk 

00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:20.760
 is selected 

00:03:17.129 --> 00:03:24.269
 go to action all tasks and then 

00:03:20.760 --> 00:03:27.660
 expand volume we get a clear 

00:03:24.269 --> 00:03:31.260
 to see where we just next and 

00:03:27.660 --> 00:03:33.450
 they choose followers for the following kili 

00:03:31.260 --> 00:03:37.730
 and we immediately see that the 

00:03:33.450 --> 00:03:39.060
 slices extensive we will save it 

00:03:37.730 --> 00:03:41.040
 and 

00:03:39.060 --> 00:03:43.019
 to the scout back then it is here 

00:03:41.040 --> 00:03:46.230
 not yet seen but if we the 

00:03:43.019 --> 00:03:49.160
 also close the explorer and we start 

00:03:46.230 --> 00:03:49.160
 again the explorer 

00:03:50.519 --> 00:03:57.230
 then it can be seen here and that is 

00:03:54.530 --> 00:04:00.590
 all we have to do 

00:03:57.230 --> 00:04:00.590
 Thank you for your attention
