working<00:00:42.480> with<00:00:42.660> a<00:00:42.719> dropper<00:00:43.260> and<00:00:43.290> our<00:00:43.710> book

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:43.950 
working with a dropper and our book

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:47.690 
working with a dropper and our book
let's<00:00:44.789> take<00:00:45.030> a<00:00:45.090> closer<00:00:45.510> look<00:00:45.690> at<00:00:46.020> this<00:00:46.700> the

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:47.700 
let's take a closer look at this the

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:51.529 
let's take a closer look at this the
years<00:00:48.030> how<00:00:48.270> this<00:00:48.600> works<00:00:49.079> arm<00:00:49.410> and<00:00:50.280> the<00:00:51.120> strop

00:00:51.529 --> 00:00:51.539 
years how this works arm and the strop

00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:54.529 
years how this works arm and the strop
are<00:00:51.750> 3<00:00:52.170> items<00:00:52.199> and<00:00:53.100> when<00:00:53.730> I<00:00:53.760> press<00:00:54.090> the<00:00:54.210> button

00:00:54.529 --> 00:00:54.539 
are 3 items and when I press the button

00:00:54.539 --> 00:00:56.630 
are 3 items and when I press the button
three<00:00:54.870> times<00:00:54.920> the<00:00:55.920> items<00:00:56.250> will<00:00:56.610> be

00:00:56.630 --> 00:00:56.640 
three times the items will be

00:00:56.640 --> 00:00:59.360 
three times the items will be
transported<00:00:57.300> into<00:00:57.870> the<00:00:58.170> hopper<00:00:58.379> than<00:00:59.100> the

00:00:59.360 --> 00:00:59.370 
transported into the hopper than the

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:03.380 
transported into the hopper than the
uppers<00:00:59.760> being<00:01:00.210> reset<00:01:00.780> and<00:01:01.969> transporters<00:01:02.969> item

00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:03.390 
uppers being reset and transporters item

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:07.160 
uppers being reset and transporters item
into<00:01:03.570> the<00:01:03.840> dropper<00:01:04.790> the<00:01:05.790> warmth<00:01:06.390> now<00:01:06.780> we<00:01:06.840> got

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:07.170 
into the dropper the warmth now we got

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:09.530 
into the dropper the warmth now we got
two<00:01:07.740> items<00:01:08.100> on<00:01:08.340> the<00:01:08.430> drop<00:01:08.700> on<00:01:08.880> one<00:01:09.210> in<00:01:09.390> the

isn't powered long enough also it sends

00:01:21.689 --> 00:01:26.390 
isn't powered long enough also it sends
all<00:01:21.900> these<00:01:22.140> items<00:01:22.409> to<00:01:22.830> the<00:01:22.890> trouble<00:01:24.680> and<00:01:25.680> this

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:26.400 
all these items to the trouble and this

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:29.120 
all these items to the trouble and this
also<00:01:26.640> allowed<00:01:27.180> for<00:01:27.210> smaller<00:01:27.840> footprint<00:01:28.439> we

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:29.130 
also allowed for smaller footprint we

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:32.030 
also allowed for smaller footprint we
only<00:01:29.280> got<00:01:29.579> a<00:01:29.850> six<00:01:30.299> by<00:01:30.479> four<00:01:30.780> now<00:01:30.990> where's<00:01:31.619> the

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:32.040 
only got a six by four now where's the

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:38.749 
only got a six by four now where's the
old<00:01:32.310> one<00:01:32.759> was<00:01:33.150> 7<00:01:33.689> by<00:01:33.720> 5<00:01:36.890> so<00:01:37.890> here's<00:01:38.460> how<00:01:38.700> to

00:01:38.749 --> 00:01:38.759 
old one was 7 by 5 so here's how to

00:01:38.759 --> 00:01:41.390 
old one was 7 by 5 so here's how to
build<00:01:39.119> it<00:01:39.360> these<00:01:40.229> are<00:01:40.500> the<00:01:40.829> items<00:01:40.950> you're

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:41.400 
build it these are the items you're

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:44.090 
build it these are the items you're
going<00:01:41.670> to<00:01:41.790> need<00:01:42.000> I<00:01:42.240> prefer<00:01:42.869> snow<00:01:43.110> because<00:01:43.799> no

going to need I prefer snow because no

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:47.300 
going to need I prefer snow because no
can't<00:01:44.460> be<00:01:44.549> broken<00:01:44.970> in<00:01:45.299> easy<00:01:45.659> with<00:01:46.310> enchanted

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:47.310 
can't be broken in easy with enchanted

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:52.880 
can't be broken in easy with enchanted
pics<00:01:48.680> and<00:01:50.210> you<00:01:51.210> don't<00:01:51.450> need<00:01:51.689> a<00:01:51.869> block<00:01:52.439> of<00:01:52.590> goal

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:52.890 
pics and you don't need a block of goal

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:56.899 
pics and you don't need a block of goal
to<00:01:53.189> any<00:01:53.340> block<00:01:53.700> will<00:01:53.970> do<00:01:54.149> actually<00:01:55.280> so<00:01:56.280> let's

00:01:56.899 --> 00:01:56.909 
to any block will do actually so let's

00:01:56.909 --> 00:02:01.760 
to any block will do actually so let's
start<00:01:57.899> with<00:01:58.439> the<00:01:58.590> bottom<00:01:58.770> oh<00:01:59.540> this<00:02:00.540> is<00:02:00.840> where

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:01.770 
start with the bottom oh this is where

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:04.880 
start with the bottom oh this is where
these<00:02:02.219> stringers<00:02:02.729> later<00:02:03.240> on<00:02:03.509> and<00:02:03.780> the<00:02:03.930> hook<00:02:04.110> or

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:04.890 
these stringers later on and the hook or

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:09.889 
these stringers later on and the hook or

00:02:39.290 --> 00:02:39.300 
hmm know that this is wrong need to go

00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:45.520 
hmm know that this is wrong need to go
one<00:02:39.660> over<00:02:40.080> to<00:02:40.260> left<00:02:43.250> ok<00:02:44.250> this<00:02:44.549> is<00:02:44.760> how<00:02:44.790> it<00:02:45.120> works

00:02:45.520 --> 00:02:45.530 
one over to left ok this is how it works

00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:49.070 
one over to left ok this is how it works
because<00:02:46.530> we<00:02:46.980> got<00:02:47.130> the<00:02:47.280> water<00:02:47.700> basin<00:02:48.269> of<00:02:48.420> over

00:02:49.070 --> 00:02:49.080 
because we got the water basin of over

00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:55.699 
because we got the water basin of over
here<00:02:51.110> and<00:02:52.110> so<00:02:53.040> this<00:02:53.670> is<00:02:53.940> how<00:02:54.209> the<00:02:54.269> bus<00:02:55.080> which<00:02:55.380> is

00:02:55.699 --> 00:02:55.709 
here and so this is how the bus which is

00:02:55.709 --> 00:03:03.830 
here and so this is how the bus which is
power<00:02:56.040> to<00:02:56.220> Diagon<00:02:56.880> Alley<00:03:01.549> this<00:03:02.549> is<00:03:02.790> where<00:03:03.690> the

00:03:03.830 --> 00:03:03.840 
power to Diagon Alley this is where the

00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:07.190 
power to Diagon Alley this is where the
water<00:03:04.049> goes<00:03:04.200> later<00:03:04.739> on<00:03:04.920> and<00:03:05.480> this<00:03:06.480> is<00:03:06.690> going<00:03:06.930> to

00:03:07.190 --> 00:03:07.200 
water goes later on and this is going to

00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:19.160 
water goes later on and this is going to
be<00:03:07.470> the<00:03:09.290> compartment<00:03:10.290> for<00:03:10.530> lava

00:03:19.160 --> 00:03:19.170 

00:03:19.170 --> 00:03:24.320 

this<00:03:20.170> is<00:03:20.349> just<00:03:20.739> one<00:03:21.069> of<00:03:21.099> safety<00:03:22.379> precautions

00:03:24.320 --> 00:03:24.330 
this is just one of safety precautions

00:03:24.330 --> 00:03:30.259 
this is just one of safety precautions
ok<00:03:25.330> this<00:03:25.720> is<00:03:26.140> powering<00:03:26.830> the<00:03:27.159> bots<00:03:27.400> which

00:03:30.259 --> 00:03:30.269 

00:03:30.269 --> 00:03:33.930
