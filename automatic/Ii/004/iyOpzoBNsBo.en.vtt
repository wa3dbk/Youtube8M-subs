00:00:05.620 --> 00:00:13.040
 when in this kind of minecraft 

00:00:10.099 --> 00:00:16.189
 we were doing fractions accounts 

00:00:13.040 --> 00:00:17.100
 sums subtracts multiplications and in the 

00:00:16.189 --> 00:00:18.800
 brands 

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:26.509
 good 

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:30.079
 learning is more a teamwork and 

00:00:26.509 --> 00:00:32.210
 this year we had as project 

00:00:30.079 --> 00:00:35.199
 new and innovative every year 

00:00:32.210 --> 00:00:39.230
 we try to make a different one that is 

00:00:35.199 --> 00:00:41.480
 include minecraft or a video game in 

00:00:39.230 --> 00:00:42.920
 classes we started with the project of 

00:00:41.480 --> 00:00:47.059
 Minecraft 

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:48.720
 the guys we had support classes with 

00:00:47.059 --> 00:00:51.390
 bernardo and with 

00:00:48.720 --> 00:00:53.160
 with us I discovered that I was 

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:54.700
 using as an educational tool in 

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:56.770
 other countries 

00:00:54.700 --> 00:01:01.410
 and by the way is not that other 

00:00:56.770 --> 00:01:04.330
 countries are the schools in what is 

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:07.660
 one of the things that we are not 

00:01:04.330 --> 00:01:11.350
 back of the trail will cause for today 

00:01:07.660 --> 00:01:13.060
 teachers of the computer science area and together 

00:01:11.350 --> 00:01:15.100
 with nicolÃ¡s we are the two people who 

00:01:13.060 --> 00:01:17.310
 We are working on this project 

00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:18.750
 integrate minecraft 

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:20.790
 education in the educational project 

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:22.890
 traditional take what is class and 

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:25.470
 take it to the virtual world of the game and 

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:28.649
 take advantage of the qualities of the game to 

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:30.570
 power in some cases or in 

00:01:28.649 --> 00:01:32.250
 others we must generate new methods of 

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:34.770
 studies in the version that we use is a 

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:36.899
 educational version of minecraft that we 

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:40.140
 it makes possible to be adjustments as for example 

00:01:36.899 --> 00:01:42.990
 that there are more challenges or less and also 

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:45.539
 be able to adapt it to some contents 

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:47.429
 specific curricula that teachers 

00:01:45.539 --> 00:01:49.470
 they wanted to work they wanted the same 

00:01:47.429 --> 00:01:51.000
 teachers but with tools that 

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:53.130
 allow the teacher to value the games 

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:55.560
 to spend it looking like for the boys not 

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:57.569
 I am a person to be able to arm tasks 

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:59.009
 in simpler the table raised us 

00:01:57.569 --> 00:02:01.259
 they were working with fractions 

00:01:59.009 --> 00:02:03.720
 then to see how it could be 

00:02:01.259 --> 00:02:05.360
 join the game the work in 

00:02:03.720 --> 00:02:09.509
 traction is what they saw in the 

00:02:05.360 --> 00:02:11.549
 sum what remains some 

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:13.319
 basic operations and they had intentions 

00:02:11.549 --> 00:02:15.630
 to see some more complex operations 

00:02:13.319 --> 00:02:18.030
 multiplication division was raised a 

00:02:15.630 --> 00:02:19.680
 Little adventure in an entire pyramid 

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:20.730
 this as a way of giving a context 

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:23.580
 of d 

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:26.159
 exploration and adventure to activity 

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:28.409
 and in the activity they were with 

00:02:26.159 --> 00:02:29.849
 plates in which they had calculations for 

00:02:28.409 --> 00:02:31.980
 resolve was answered correctly 

00:02:29.849 --> 00:02:33.659
 progressed in a room nearby within 

00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:36.120
 the pyramid and if they responded in 

00:02:33.659 --> 00:02:38.670
 The floor was opened and they brought 

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:40.709
 a kind of underground labyrinth 

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:42.430
 between that they had to leave all this 

00:02:40.709 --> 00:02:44.469
 as to give it a 

00:02:42.430 --> 00:02:46.329
 takes advantage of this motivation of 

00:02:44.469 --> 00:02:47.890
 game not true they hooked a lot 

00:02:46.329 --> 00:02:51.219
 with this the first differentiation if 

00:02:47.890 --> 00:02:53.650
 there was much comment is much laughed the 

00:02:51.219 --> 00:02:54.760
 I like many and what is important is 

00:02:53.650 --> 00:02:56.379
 that not that they stayed nothing giving 

00:02:54.760 --> 00:02:58.329
 laps in the labyrinth wasting time 

00:02:56.379 --> 00:03:00.670
 quickly they sought to leave and go up again 

00:02:58.329 --> 00:03:02.709
 to be able to continue progressing 

00:03:00.670 --> 00:03:04.150
 then they advanced and what happened 

00:03:02.709 --> 00:03:06.129
 they found that they reached a point is 

00:03:04.150 --> 00:03:07.750
 that they could not solve some calculations 

00:03:06.129 --> 00:03:09.159
 because they incorporated operations that 

00:03:07.750 --> 00:03:10.450
 had not yet seen in class and I 

00:03:09.159 --> 00:03:12.730
 They asked if they could use the internet 

00:03:10.450 --> 00:03:14.260
 they arranged and investigate how 

00:03:12.730 --> 00:03:16.299
 solved in those operations by more than 

00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:17.950
 they had not seen them in class what was 

00:03:16.299 --> 00:03:20.409
 noticing the teacher when we went after 

00:03:17.950 --> 00:03:23.470
 talking to that is that when he had his 

00:03:20.409 --> 00:03:25.419
 self-esteem there was really an important 

00:03:23.470 --> 00:03:26.680
 change the interest regarding how 

00:03:25.419 --> 00:03:30.069
 they had been working before they are a 

00:03:26.680 --> 00:03:31.750
 very good initiative we liked since it was 

00:03:30.069 --> 00:03:34.360
 they can take different subjects like 

00:03:31.750 --> 00:03:36.880
 teacher I feel free 

00:03:34.360 --> 00:03:38.890
 although they understood the concept 

00:03:36.880 --> 00:03:41.920
 in a group way that one of the things 

00:03:38.890 --> 00:03:44.920
 change I really loved is to see the 

00:03:41.920 --> 00:03:48.130
 joy with which the boys work in 

00:03:44.920 --> 00:03:51.430
 the class and know what you can learn 

00:03:48.130 --> 00:03:53.410
 let's say in a funny way and playing that 

00:03:51.430 --> 00:03:56.330
 it is through this video game they were given 

00:03:53.410 --> 00:04:00.680
 mind that if in group 

00:03:56.330 --> 00:04:01.920
 they were getting difficult and could not 

00:04:00.680 --> 00:04:05.430
 move along 

00:04:01.920 --> 00:04:08.489
 and this was incorporating not 

00:04:05.430 --> 00:04:11.340
 only to play but they are noto 

00:04:08.489 --> 00:04:13.319
 that there is a change of attitude on 3 

00:04:11.340 --> 00:04:16.350
 and that the results as they obviously are 

00:04:13.319 --> 00:04:19.350
 positive to me also turned out to be 

00:04:16.350 --> 00:04:22.370
 difficult to say good what is the 

00:04:19.350 --> 00:04:25.570
 activity that I can propose so that 

00:04:22.370 --> 00:04:28.300
 somehow serve 

00:04:25.570 --> 00:04:33.210
 until well I really understood that no 

00:04:28.300 --> 00:04:36.960
 it was so complicated that a theme was downloaded 

00:04:33.210 --> 00:04:40.500
 and in the most simple and dynamic way 

00:04:36.960 --> 00:04:41.819
 the idea is developed and worked for 

00:04:40.500 --> 00:04:43.650
 next year for the school year 

00:04:41.819 --> 00:04:45.810
 because of course we want to continue 

00:04:43.650 --> 00:04:48.270
 working with minecraft is that the 

00:04:45.810 --> 00:04:50.190
 teachers can be trained and we can 

00:04:48.270 --> 00:04:52.020
 generate proposals where they can 

00:04:50.190 --> 00:04:54.330
 be also within the worlds or 

00:04:52.020 --> 00:04:56.250
 integrated in the scenarios of doing 

00:04:54.330 --> 00:04:58.440
 experiences within the game with the 

00:04:56.250 --> 00:05:01.800
 students using the medium as you 

00:04:58.440 --> 00:05:04.889
 have fun learning more instead on 

00:05:01.800 --> 00:05:07.889
 a class with very tight learn to 

00:05:04.889 --> 00:05:08.610
 learn to learn but we do not have no 

00:05:07.889 --> 00:05:11.639
 you free 

00:05:08.610 --> 00:05:13.320
 learning is never different is a change 

00:05:11.639 --> 00:05:16.160
 when crafter problem you had fun 

00:05:13.320 --> 00:05:16.160
 excited
