 c4 cactus review of detail with him 

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:42.180
 citroën presents his vision of suv a 

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:43.950
 particular vision because the newcomer 

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:45.539
 is slightly higher than a renault 

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:46.550
 clio to keep a good 

00:00:45.539 --> 00:00:48.600
 aerodynamic 

00:00:46.550 --> 00:00:50.879
 aesthetically the fans of the concept 

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:51.750
 precursor will be delighted because almost 

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:53.910
 nothing changes 

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:56.160
 the builder simply added 

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:58.350
 side windows a rear window and 

00:00:56.160 --> 00:01:01.079
 the central amounts citroën said 

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:02.820
 look for more simplicity but he 

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:05.400
 do not see it as a model 

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:06.689
 low cost way dacia explanations with 

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:08.880
 our journalist 

00:01:06.689 --> 00:01:10.530
 florian chopin this c4 cactus will be a 

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:10.890
 little more upscale than the 

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:13.229
 duster 

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:15.780
 because a little more technological with 

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:18.420
 a touch screen on the console a screen 

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:20.250
 digital as a storyteller and then 

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:23.340
 latest-generation engines from 

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:27.390
 three-cylinder thp with stop and start 

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:29.729
 with small engines you hd in 

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:31.439
 entry-level so it will be a lot 

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:33.150
 more technological than the club of steur 

00:01:31.439 --> 00:01:35.970
 everything that was presented on the 

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:37.860
 concept will be standard on the c4 cactus 

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:40.049
 the men's herbs on the side with the 

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:42.659
 small air bubbles inside the 

00:01:40.049 --> 00:01:45.420
 console with storage that rejects 

00:01:42.659 --> 00:01:48.119
 the airbag on the ceiling will be 

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:50.159
 series will end even buses 

00:01:48.119 --> 00:01:52.560
 washing on windshield wipers 

00:01:50.159 --> 00:01:54.689

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:10.979
 technically citroen has managed to do 

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:12.120
 lower the weight of 200 kg compared to 

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:14.190
 a c4 

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:17.099
