hello<00:00:10.400> today<00:00:10.880> we<00:00:11.059> are<00:00:11.090> going<00:00:11.389> to<00:00:11.480> be<00:00:11.570> taking<00:00:11.870> a

00:00:11.950 --> 00:00:11.960 
hello today we are going to be taking a

00:00:11.960 --> 00:00:15.990 
hello today we are going to be taking a
look<00:00:12.110> at<00:00:12.170> two<00:00:12.620> swimming<00:00:13.040> pool<00:00:13.219> alarm<00:00:13.580> systems

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:16.000 
look at two swimming pool alarm systems

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:18.790 
look at two swimming pool alarm systems
these<00:00:17.000> two<00:00:17.270> alarms<00:00:17.690> are<00:00:17.900> the<00:00:18.080> swim<00:00:18.320> alert<00:00:18.590> and

00:00:18.790 --> 00:00:18.800 
these two alarms are the swim alert and

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:21.939 
these two alarms are the swim alert and
the<00:00:18.949> pool<00:00:19.160> guard<00:00:20.199> what<00:00:21.199> we<00:00:21.320> are<00:00:21.440> going<00:00:21.680> to<00:00:21.770> do

00:00:21.939 --> 00:00:21.949 
the pool guard what we are going to do

00:00:21.949 --> 00:00:23.830 
the pool guard what we are going to do
is<00:00:22.190> show<00:00:22.400> you<00:00:22.460> a<00:00:22.580> demonstration<00:00:22.820> of<00:00:23.480> how<00:00:23.630> each

00:00:23.830 --> 00:00:23.840 
is show you a demonstration of how each

00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:26.950 
is show you a demonstration of how each
of<00:00:23.870> these<00:00:24.170> pool<00:00:24.470> alarm<00:00:24.740> systems<00:00:25.190> works<00:00:25.960> this

00:00:26.950 --> 00:00:26.960 
of these pool alarm systems works this

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:28.630 
of these pool alarm systems works this
will<00:00:27.170> give<00:00:27.320> you<00:00:27.470> a<00:00:27.500> better<00:00:27.740> idea<00:00:27.830> of<00:00:28.160> what<00:00:28.610> to

00:00:28.630 --> 00:00:28.640 
will give you a better idea of what to

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:31.529 
will give you a better idea of what to
expect<00:00:28.880> from<00:00:29.390> each<00:00:29.570> alarm<00:00:29.960> let's<00:00:30.470> get<00:00:30.680> started

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:31.539 
expect from each alarm let's get started

00:00:31.539 --> 00:00:33.819 
expect from each alarm let's get started
the<00:00:32.539> first<00:00:32.780> test<00:00:33.050> we<00:00:33.170> will<00:00:33.230> put<00:00:33.410> these<00:00:33.500> alarm

00:00:33.819 --> 00:00:33.829 
the first test we will put these alarm

00:00:33.829 --> 00:00:35.560 
the first test we will put these alarm
systems<00:00:34.219> through<00:00:34.460> will<00:00:34.850> be<00:00:34.940> to<00:00:35.059> simulate<00:00:35.480> a

00:00:35.560 --> 00:00:35.570 
systems through will be to simulate a

00:00:35.570 --> 00:00:37.479 
systems through will be to simulate a
surface<00:00:35.960> disturbance<00:00:36.289> in<00:00:36.620> the<00:00:36.710> water<00:00:36.920> but<00:00:37.430> not

00:00:37.479 --> 00:00:37.489 
surface disturbance in the water but not

00:00:37.489 --> 00:00:41.169 
surface disturbance in the water but not
from<00:00:37.850> the<00:00:37.940> person<00:00:38.270> or<00:00:38.329> pet<00:00:39.550> this<00:00:40.550> way<00:00:40.789> we<00:00:41.030> can

00:00:41.169 --> 00:00:41.179 
from the person or pet this way we can

00:00:41.179 --> 00:00:43.029 
from the person or pet this way we can
see<00:00:41.390> if<00:00:41.480> either<00:00:41.690> pool<00:00:42.050> alarm<00:00:42.409> will<00:00:42.710> set<00:00:42.890> off<00:00:43.010> a

00:00:43.029 --> 00:00:43.039 
see if either pool alarm will set off a

00:00:43.039 --> 00:00:43.840 
see if either pool alarm will set off a
false<00:00:43.399> alarm

00:00:43.840 --> 00:00:43.850 
false alarm

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:46.180 
false alarm
second<00:00:44.659> we<00:00:44.809> are<00:00:44.839> going<00:00:45.079> to<00:00:45.199> simulate<00:00:45.440> a<00:00:45.679> 20

00:00:46.180 --> 00:00:46.190 
second we are going to simulate a 20

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:48.520 
second we are going to simulate a 20
pound<00:00:46.399> person<00:00:46.789> falling<00:00:47.479> into<00:00:47.719> the<00:00:47.839> pool<00:00:48.050> to

00:00:48.520 --> 00:00:48.530 
pound person falling into the pool to

00:00:48.530 --> 00:00:50.259 
pound person falling into the pool to
see<00:00:48.710> how<00:00:48.859> the<00:00:48.920> alarm<00:00:49.339> reacts<00:00:49.850> with<00:00:49.969> a<00:00:49.999> large

00:00:50.259 --> 00:00:50.269 
see how the alarm reacts with a large

00:00:50.269 --> 00:00:52.840 
see how the alarm reacts with a large
object<00:00:50.510> immersion<00:00:51.199> under<00:00:51.469> the<00:00:51.559> water<00:00:51.850> first

00:00:52.840 --> 00:00:52.850 
object immersion under the water first

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:54.849 
object immersion under the water first
we<00:00:53.210> will<00:00:53.329> start<00:00:53.479> by<00:00:53.749> throwing<00:00:54.050> the<00:00:54.229> fall<00:00:54.469> into

00:00:54.849 --> 00:00:54.859 
we will start by throwing the fall into

00:00:54.859 --> 00:00:57.029 
we will start by throwing the fall into
the<00:00:54.949> pool<00:00:55.190> with<00:00:55.519> the<00:00:55.609> swimmer<00:00:55.879> installed<00:00:56.569> as

00:00:57.029 --> 00:00:57.039 
the pool with the swimmer installed as

00:00:57.039 --> 00:00:59.649 
the pool with the swimmer installed as
we<00:00:58.039> can<00:00:58.219> see<00:00:58.429> the<00:00:58.639> swimmers<00:00:59.120> immersion

00:00:59.649 --> 00:00:59.659 
we can see the swimmers immersion

00:00:59.659 --> 00:01:02.049 
we can see the swimmers immersion
detection<00:01:00.170> was<00:01:00.319> not<00:01:00.559> alerted<00:01:01.129> and<00:01:01.309> it<00:01:01.789> did<00:01:01.940> not

00:01:02.049 --> 00:01:02.059 
detection was not alerted and it did not

00:01:02.059 --> 00:01:03.309 
detection was not alerted and it did not
set<00:01:02.299> off<00:01:02.329> a<00:01:02.449> false<00:01:02.749> alarm

00:01:03.309 --> 00:01:03.319 
set off a false alarm

00:01:03.319 --> 00:01:05.020 
set off a false alarm
now<00:01:03.679> we<00:01:03.739> will<00:01:03.949> do<00:01:04.129> the<00:01:04.250> same<00:01:04.430> test<00:01:04.729> with<00:01:04.940> the

00:01:05.020 --> 00:01:05.030 
now we will do the same test with the

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:15.069 
now we will do the same test with the
pool<00:01:05.210> guard<00:01:13.180> we<00:01:14.180> can<00:01:14.360> see<00:01:14.570> that<00:01:14.719> the<00:01:14.869> pool

00:01:15.069 --> 00:01:15.079 
pool guard we can see that the pool

00:01:15.079 --> 00:01:16.990 
pool guard we can see that the pool
guard<00:01:15.350> set<00:01:15.619> off<00:01:15.710> a<00:01:15.740> false<00:01:16.159> alarm<00:01:16.490> when<00:01:16.880> the

00:01:16.990 --> 00:01:17.000 
guard set off a false alarm when the

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:19.660 
guard set off a false alarm when the
ball<00:01:17.180> was<00:01:17.390> thrown<00:01:17.420> into<00:01:17.780> the<00:01:17.960> water<00:01:18.549> next<00:01:19.549> we

00:01:19.660 --> 00:01:19.670 
ball was thrown into the water next we

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:21.550 
ball was thrown into the water next we
will<00:01:19.789> use<00:01:20.030> this<00:01:20.270> bag<00:01:20.570> of<00:01:20.750> weight<00:01:20.960> to<00:01:21.350> simulate

00:01:21.550 --> 00:01:21.560 
will use this bag of weight to simulate

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:29.249 
will use this bag of weight to simulate
a<00:01:21.829> 20<00:01:22.250> pound<00:01:22.460> person<00:01:22.850> falling<00:01:23.570> into<00:01:23.780> the<00:01:23.869> water

00:01:29.249 --> 00:01:29.259 

00:01:29.259 --> 00:01:32.260 

within<00:01:30.259> seconds<00:01:31.070> the<00:01:31.219> swim<00:01:31.460> aware<00:01:31.759> goes<00:01:32.030> off

00:01:32.260 --> 00:01:32.270 
within seconds the swim aware goes off

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:34.529 
within seconds the swim aware goes off
letting<00:01:32.659> us<00:01:32.899> know<00:01:32.930> of<00:01:33.350> someone<00:01:33.590> in<00:01:33.859> the<00:01:33.950> pool

00:01:34.529 --> 00:01:34.539 
letting us know of someone in the pool

00:01:34.539 --> 00:01:36.999 
letting us know of someone in the pool
now<00:01:35.539> we'll<00:01:35.750> throw<00:01:35.899> the<00:01:36.049> bag<00:01:36.229> in<00:01:36.259> with<00:01:36.649> the<00:01:36.770> pool

00:01:36.999 --> 00:01:37.009 
now we'll throw the bag in with the pool

00:01:37.009 --> 00:01:44.410 
now we'll throw the bag in with the pool
guard<00:01:37.310> installed<00:01:42.520> we<00:01:43.520> can<00:01:43.549> see<00:01:43.939> that<00:01:44.119> the<00:01:44.240> pool

guard installed we can see that the pool

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:46.599 
guard installed we can see that the pool
guard<00:01:44.719> also<00:01:45.320> alerts<00:01:45.619> us<00:01:45.829> when<00:01:46.039> someone<00:01:46.399> is<00:01:46.520> in
