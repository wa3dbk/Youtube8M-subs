fire<00:03:48.650> coming<00:03:49.650> out<00:03:49.859> of<00:03:49.919> the<00:03:50.220> hands<00:03:51.060> so<00:03:51.810> that's

00:03:52.250 --> 00:03:52.260 
fire coming out of the hands so that's

00:03:52.260 --> 00:03:54.650 
fire coming out of the hands so that's
similar<00:03:52.829> to<00:03:52.859> this

00:03:54.650 --> 00:03:54.660 
similar to this

00:03:54.660 --> 00:03:58.730 
similar to this
but<00:03:55.530> this<00:03:55.710> one<00:03:55.920> is<00:03:56.100> more<00:03:57.230> detail<00:03:58.230> that<00:03:58.530> has<00:03:58.560> a

00:03:58.730 --> 00:03:58.740 
but this one is more detail that has a

00:03:58.740 --> 00:04:01.700 
but this one is more detail that has a
lot<00:03:58.890> more<00:03:58.950> articulation<00:04:00.350> but<00:04:01.350> I<00:04:01.380> just<00:04:01.560> thought

00:04:01.700 --> 00:04:01.710 
lot more articulation but I just thought

00:04:01.710 --> 00:04:05.660 
lot more articulation but I just thought
it<00:04:01.860> would<00:04:01.920> be<00:04:01.980> cool<00:04:02.250> to<00:04:02.310> compare<00:04:03.090> it<00:04:04.370> next<00:04:05.370> to

00:04:05.660 --> 00:04:05.670 
it would be cool to compare it next to

00:04:05.670 --> 00:04:09.020 
it would be cool to compare it next to
that<00:04:05.820> one<00:04:06.440> right<00:04:07.440> there<00:04:07.740> so<00:04:08.730> it<00:04:08.790> looks<00:04:08.970> like

00:04:09.020 --> 00:04:09.030 
that one right there so it looks like

00:04:09.030 --> 00:04:14.210 
that one right there so it looks like
and<00:04:10.340> this<00:04:11.340> is<00:04:11.730> just<00:04:12.060> a<00:04:12.180> Lego<00:04:12.710> minifigure<00:04:13.710> base

00:04:14.210 --> 00:04:14.220 
and this is just a Lego minifigure base

00:04:14.220 --> 00:04:16.220 
and this is just a Lego minifigure base
that<00:04:14.520> I<00:04:14.550> put<00:04:14.820> it<00:04:14.940> on<00:04:15.060> because<00:04:15.450> the<00:04:15.810> the<00:04:16.019> brick

00:04:16.220 --> 00:04:16.230 
that I put it on because the the brick

00:04:16.230 --> 00:04:19.370 
that I put it on because the the brick
one<00:04:16.260> does<00:04:16.680> it<00:04:17.540> it's<00:04:18.540> kind<00:04:18.690> of<00:04:18.810> hard<00:04:18.989> to<00:04:19.049> put<00:04:19.260> it

00:04:19.370 --> 00:04:19.380 
one does it it's kind of hard to put it

00:04:19.380 --> 00:04:24.620 
one does it it's kind of hard to put it
on<00:04:20.090> but<00:04:22.670> mmm<00:04:23.670> I<00:04:23.760> just<00:04:24.030> wanted<00:04:24.240> taking<00:04:24.510> those

00:04:24.620 --> 00:04:24.630 
on but mmm I just wanted taking those

00:04:24.630 --> 00:04:30.020 
on but mmm I just wanted taking those
off<00:04:25.400> but<00:04:26.400> that's<00:04:27.330> pretty<00:04:27.630> much<00:04:27.780> it<00:04:28.520> be<00:04:29.520> sure<00:04:29.760> to

00:04:30.020 --> 00:04:30.030 
off but that's pretty much it be sure to

00:04:30.030 --> 00:04:32.360 
off but that's pretty much it be sure to
