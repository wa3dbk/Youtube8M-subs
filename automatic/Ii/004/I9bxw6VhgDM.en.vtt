00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.359
 Yes 

00:00:04.800 --> 00:00:09.790
 hi everyone welcome to a 

00:00:06.670 --> 00:00:11.290
 new episode turn on copy 2 

00:00:09.790 --> 00:00:12.340
 so today would especially want 

00:00:11.290 --> 00:00:13.690
 room by cons not this need 

00:00:12.340 --> 00:00:14.860
 now for the team because of 

00:00:13.690 --> 00:00:16.330
 anyway it's a shame but 

00:00:14.860 --> 00:00:17.710
 it's the only one it's the only game mode 

00:00:16.330 --> 00:00:19.300
 which is available on pc finally this is the 

00:00:17.710 --> 00:00:21.160
 only days mode there are more than 200 

00:00:19.300 --> 00:00:22.119
 people so good not really the choice 

00:00:21.160 --> 00:00:24.460
 but we'll still try to 

00:00:22.119 --> 00:00:25.840
 to do with this great general the parties 

00:00:24.460 --> 00:00:27.580
 are really relatively ok we have 

00:00:25.840 --> 00:00:29.470
 still ping it's pretty good 

00:00:27.580 --> 00:00:31.269
 even compared to ghost I find they 

00:00:29.470 --> 00:00:33.250
 are pretty stubborn after I know there is 

00:00:31.269 --> 00:00:34.510
 a lot of people who find that the 

00:00:33.250 --> 00:00:36.280
 finds that it's thorny of ghost are 

00:00:34.510 --> 00:00:37.299
 better than those of the black ops 2 

00:00:36.280 --> 00:00:39.549
 but it's not my case at all 

00:00:37.299 --> 00:00:40.839
 prefer largely I much prefer 

00:00:39.549 --> 00:00:44.010
 the connection I have on black ops from 

00:00:40.839 --> 00:00:46.030
 high level I guess everyone at his 

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:47.229
 each to a dispute a different 

00:00:46.030 --> 00:00:48.699
 connections to different providers 

00:00:47.229 --> 00:00:50.320
 access it must change quite a bit in 

00:00:48.699 --> 00:00:52.330
 function of the access provider not the 

00:00:50.320 --> 00:00:53.769
 less than I heard but 

00:00:52.330 --> 00:00:55.949
 good meanwhile turn on black ops 

00:00:53.769 --> 00:00:58.180
 of joual n 94 or simply because 

00:00:55.949 --> 00:01:00.820
 good because I want to take a 

00:00:58.180 --> 00:01:02.320
 simplicity let's say today I have 

00:01:00.820 --> 00:01:06.549
 not especially want to annoy me 

00:01:02.320 --> 00:01:08.620
 so like that and the plum of 

00:01:06.549 --> 00:01:10.090
 first parts I'm doing since one 

00:01:08.620 --> 00:01:11.080
 good time I do not really want 

00:01:10.090 --> 00:01:12.580
 to make the task more difficult 

00:01:11.080 --> 00:01:16.440
 especially that I have as it is necessary that I 

00:01:12.580 --> 00:01:16.440
 rehashed a bit and it was not happening 

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:21.610
 olalalala but not the son japan 

00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:23.020
 I was at how much the task was at 7.0 

00:01:21.610 --> 00:01:25.660
 and I get hurry and by a guy that 

00:01:23.020 --> 00:01:28.600
 shotgun the taz them but I 

00:01:25.660 --> 00:01:29.470
 was not expecting a parent at all 

00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:30.550
 or a friend of the series maybe a little 

00:01:29.470 --> 00:01:35.350
 high for the good match to death by 

00:01:30.550 --> 00:01:37.380
 team I did not catch but hey we do 

00:01:35.350 --> 00:01:37.380
 with 

00:01:38.050 --> 00:01:47.920
 ok I think someone at skiing are 

00:01:46.360 --> 00:01:50.190
 also his bone who are I know that there are 

00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:50.190
 there but 

00:01:52.150 --> 00:01:57.950
 must believe that no I start I love 

00:01:56.540 --> 00:01:59.660
 the way we move in this game 

00:01:57.950 --> 00:02:02.060
 comparable because of them we are we are 

00:01:59.660 --> 00:02:03.950
 fast we are responsive to clubs 

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:05.330
 there like two kids it's great 

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:10.970
 julie boulet job like solberg is 

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:13.090
 in front we are really super responsive on 

00:02:10.970 --> 00:02:14.690
 this game we can aim at stopped aims and 

00:02:13.090 --> 00:02:15.350
 stop running empty and 

00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:18.290
 instantly 

00:02:15.350 --> 00:02:19.220
 it's really too much of a good thing 

00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:20.180
 serious because I wonder it's not 

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:21.770
 the pump guy who is there 

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:31.100
 I do not really want to 

00:02:21.770 --> 00:02:36.020
 junk food and see what they are all 

00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:38.590
 parties where they are more than 4 so at 

00:02:36.020 --> 00:02:38.590
 fouquet s 

00:02:42.109 --> 00:02:51.780
 worrying yeah I was wondering what 

00:02:48.420 --> 00:03:01.109
 the crazy ally take away the party has the 

00:02:51.780 --> 00:03:04.739
 train and two enemies that are where I 

00:03:01.109 --> 00:03:05.750
 I'm no longer here we pass the standard years to 

00:03:04.739 --> 00:03:14.639
 others not 

00:03:05.750 --> 00:03:17.370
 I'm fine something by the up 

00:03:14.639 --> 00:03:18.750
 8-7 to the red wings actually it's more 

00:03:17.370 --> 00:03:22.799
 easy that douglas tough hilton has 

00:03:18.750 --> 00:03:28.769

00:03:31.620 --> 00:03:36.629
 he continued to advance in addition this is 

00:03:35.010 --> 00:03:40.349

00:03:40.349 --> 00:03:43.730
 think but I do not know 

00:03:49.200 --> 00:04:00.910

00:04:36.300 --> 00:04:37.590

00:04:37.230 --> 00:04:40.230

00:04:37.590 --> 00:04:41.520
 oh shit against web by the salty 

00:04:40.230 --> 00:04:43.170

00:04:41.520 --> 00:04:45.500

00:04:43.170 --> 00:04:45.500
 l'ai now 

00:04:45.680 --> 00:04:50.040
 but hey it's horrible because of them 

00:04:47.460 --> 00:04:51.090
 yeah fucking I was not expecting it 

00:04:50.040 --> 00:04:53.430
 true I love black ops that we can 

00:04:51.090 --> 00:04:54.960
 nothing has ghost olalalala this part 

00:04:53.430 --> 00:04:56.130
 was too good by the end I did 

00:04:54.960 --> 00:04:57.600
 too much shit at the end 

00:04:56.130 --> 00:05:01.310
 it was like a good part is 

00:04:57.600 --> 00:05:03.600
 mixed shit pretty ugly 

00:05:01.310 --> 00:05:04.280
 to read the last part I did 

00:05:03.600 --> 00:05:07.590
 I did the same thing 

00:05:04.280 --> 00:05:09.570
 good finally in these two styles two 

00:05:07.590 --> 00:05:10.800
 episodes good bah I still hope that 

00:05:09.570 --> 00:05:12.600
 this return on black ops will not have pleased you 

00:05:10.800 --> 00:05:13.950
 me in any case I really too much too much 

00:05:12.600 --> 00:05:16.170
 kiffed me I leave the cause of these 

00:05:13.950 --> 00:05:17.490
 really excellent and it's true that 

00:05:16.170 --> 00:05:18.720
 level of fluidity at the level of 

00:05:17.490 --> 00:05:21.120
 movements and everything really was not 

00:05:18.720 --> 00:05:22.770
 same and that's saying that there too we 

00:05:21.120 --> 00:05:24.270
 is reactive we really win by 

00:05:22.770 --> 00:05:26.040
 report to ghost that site and 

00:05:24.270 --> 00:05:28.020
 responsive anyway your personal it does not 

00:05:26.040 --> 00:05:29.550
 is not so not in the end that's it 

00:05:28.020 --> 00:05:30.570
 not it's not tip top but I preferred 

00:05:29.550 --> 00:05:32.280
 it's true that responsiveness in black 

00:05:30.570 --> 00:05:34.350
 up 2 2 that's really what was it 

00:05:32.280 --> 00:05:35.850
 who is she better and ben I love it 

00:05:34.350 --> 00:05:37.350
 this is good I hope this little 

00:05:35.850 --> 00:05:38.730
 video on b2 you will have liked kind would 

00:05:37.350 --> 00:05:40.920
 surely others one anyway seen 

00:05:38.730 --> 00:05:42.060
 that even that I much prefer when 

00:05:40.920 --> 00:05:42.780
 even blackhawks 2 but what is 

00:05:42.060 --> 00:05:44.310
 shame is that we can play like 

00:05:42.780 --> 00:05:45.600
 team death match but good bah 

00:05:44.310 --> 00:05:46.830
 so much to listen we will make the gold match by 

00:05:45.600 --> 00:05:48.030
 team and then that's so bah tell me 

00:05:46.830 --> 00:05:49.410
 if you want more black ops 2 

00:05:48.030 --> 00:05:51.060
 rather than ghost I think you have 

00:05:49.410 --> 00:05:52.500
 already not bad said to return on black 

00:05:51.060 --> 00:05:53.910
 ops 2 compared to ghost I'm going when 

00:05:52.500 --> 00:05:56.430
 even continue the focus on ghost or 

00:05:53.910 --> 00:05:58.050
 least at least focus what I think 

00:05:56.430 --> 00:05:58.950
 because that's fine I come when 

00:05:58.050 --> 00:06:00.900
 even people who are interested in 

00:05:58.950 --> 00:06:01.980
 our cities all but well here's so bah 

00:06:00.900 --> 00:06:03.270
 I can leave you there I 

00:06:01.980 --> 00:06:04.590
 you say no and good evening and we 

00:06:03.270 --> 00:06:06.900
 find for the next video that 

00:06:04.590 --> 00:06:09.980
 will surely be the focus on the vector and 

00:06:06.900 --> 00:06:09.980
 aulas go ciao voice
