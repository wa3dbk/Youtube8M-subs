00:03:11.310 --> 00:03:11.320 
did it in an efficient way what it is is

00:03:11.320 --> 00:03:13.320 
did it in an efficient way what it is is
put<00:03:11.590> when<00:03:12.010> you're<00:03:12.160> starting<00:03:12.640> up<00:03:12.820> a<00:03:12.940> team<00:03:13.150> or

00:03:13.320 --> 00:03:13.330 
put when you're starting up a team or

00:03:13.330 --> 00:03:14.760 
put when you're starting up a team or
you're<00:03:13.660> going<00:03:13.750> to<00:03:13.840> start<00:03:14.020> off<00:03:14.080> a<00:03:14.140> game<00:03:14.380> you

00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:14.770 
you're going to start off a game you

00:03:14.770 --> 00:03:18.150 
you're going to start off a game you
want<00:03:14.980> to<00:03:15.070> put<00:03:15.280> the<00:03:15.880> game<00:03:16.500> accelerator<00:03:17.500> it's<00:03:17.680> 25

00:03:18.150 --> 00:03:18.160 
want to put the game accelerator it's 25

00:03:18.160 --> 00:03:19.470 
want to put the game accelerator it's 25
seconds<00:03:18.580> which<00:03:18.700> is<00:03:18.730> the<00:03:18.910> most<00:03:19.060> you'll<00:03:19.330> get

00:03:19.470 --> 00:03:19.480 
seconds which is the most you'll get

00:03:19.480 --> 00:03:21.449 
seconds which is the most you'll get
normally<00:03:20.230> the<00:03:20.440> games<00:03:20.620> are<00:03:20.830> two<00:03:21.010> minutes<00:03:21.310> long

00:03:21.449 --> 00:03:21.459 
normally the games are two minutes long

00:03:21.459 --> 00:03:23.550 
normally the games are two minutes long
for<00:03:21.670> the<00:03:21.730> first<00:03:21.910> I<00:03:22.000> think<00:03:22.060> 10<00:03:22.420> games<00:03:22.690> so<00:03:23.380> with

for the first I think 10 games so with
the<00:03:23.650> 25<00:03:24.010> set<00:03:24.310> a<00:03:24.490> second<00:03:25.240> accelerator<00:03:25.720> it's

00:03:26.010 --> 00:03:26.020
