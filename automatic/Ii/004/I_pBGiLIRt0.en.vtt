00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.929
 lloris has delegated his croque madame this 

00:00:02.370 --> 00:00:06.540
 annual report city and sisters batal 

00:00:03.929 --> 00:00:10.349
 4th girl at all new series so 

00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:12.420
 serene tutorial tips on 

00:00:10.349 --> 00:00:14.130
 vehicles so battlefield catch 

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:18.420
 start right away with the helicopter 

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:20.760
 fight on shanghai siege 1,36 0 with 

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:22.350
 a stranger who is mounted directly 

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:24.900
 with me from the beginning who made him the 

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:26.670
 46 00 that in the gunboat we count 

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:29.519
 of course it's easier 

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:30.929
 less to kill people who are not 

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:31.769
 not in vehicles on the other hand 

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:34.290
 query level 

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:37.380
 it's better to fart the vehicles finally 

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:39.350
 that of requests are easier 

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:41.430
 to fart the vehicles that the soldiers 

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:43.410
 that normal soldiers what 

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:45.989
 walk is still enough 

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:48.000
 impressive I think I did not 

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:49.950
 not touched or not I do not know but 

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:51.899
 when you shoot three four queries or 

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:53.789
 even the room of 14 to a mono but who 

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:55.379
 takes the patch fart a lead finally brief 

00:00:53.789 --> 00:00:58.920
 it is by aircraft and combat helicopters 

00:00:55.379 --> 00:01:00.510
 shanghai seat a perfect it's a 

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:01.559
 of the best brands I think for the 

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:03.989
 fighting echoes because you do not have 

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:04.949
 no fucking career vehicles 

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:07.560
 I do not know what these names are 

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:09.390
 daubes the monumental that you do not hide 

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:10.470
 no common km and who do you shoot you know 

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:13.560
 not all the same but it's the one in the 

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:14.580
 mouth so the only thing it takes 

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:18.000
 be careful it's the guys at 

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:19.619
 stinger the beloved angry pezier osmo and the 

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:21.509
 other helicopters the helicopters and half word 

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:23.369
 that I think this ponot of cti colas 

00:01:21.509 --> 00:01:26.909
 in the vicinity of a minute 

00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:28.159
 a little like the little little 1.6 in 

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:29.970
 forming his passages at home was 

00:01:28.159 --> 00:01:32.610
 separate sun than gratitude 

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:36.030
 vocal your little machine guns that is 

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:37.619
 super good enough big scores with and 

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:39.030
 so here I have you a little planted the 

00:01:37.619 --> 00:01:40.680
 subject and it's true that it's a shame 

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:42.990
 that I was with a stranger because 

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:44.340
 look there because there I 'm going to you 

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:46.020
 talk about the lords rather directly 

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:47.880
 I shot but nothing of their skin 

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:49.979
 wanted because sometimes when the 

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:51.570
 vehicle is well in front of you even though the 

00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:53.159
 heat it will take itself missiles in 

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:54.680
 do's have to try to do it and do it 

00:01:53.159 --> 00:01:57.360
 spit missiles 

00:01:54.680 --> 00:01:59.870
 to make them spit sadness and a half seller 

00:01:57.360 --> 00:02:01.950
 it makes more sense to wait 

00:01:59.870 --> 00:02:05.250
 Once I know how to explain 

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:06.450
 after that depends on must wait until 

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:07.380
 the sic guy but who comes from 

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:08.790
 to leave them because there is someone 

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:10.170
 to lock it here is the wanted 

00:02:08.790 --> 00:02:13.080
 shoot missiles live in the mouth 

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:14.460
 if he comes from spawn down you the look is 

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:15.660
 for nothing you expect them to shoot 

00:02:14.460 --> 00:02:17.460
 theirs once that attract them or 

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:20.580
 shot missiles close it will be more 

00:02:17.460 --> 00:02:22.260
 easy of 2 the pt finally short must 

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:24.600
 try to gauge it's like you when 

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:25.590
 you do the cfo do not pull the 

00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:28.110
 lures directly but it takes 

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:29.220
 really wait for the homicide if you 

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:30.450
 can see it in addition it was 

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:32.760
 by the way, it's the top 

00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:34.950
 short after that you have to have to 

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:36.660
 allow experience so there is no 

00:02:34.950 --> 00:02:39.590
 of advice to drive the bicots that 

00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:42.600
 does not exist just have to train in 

00:02:39.590 --> 00:02:44.970
 training camp have to train a 

00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:48.270
 grazed buildings to fly around etc 

00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:49.710
 shave no I can not you 

00:02:48.270 --> 00:02:52.020
 discard on this after need to know 

00:02:49.710 --> 00:02:53.910
 handle joystick but at the level of 

00:02:52.020 --> 00:02:55.500
 queries and equipment that I put 

00:02:53.910 --> 00:02:57.540
 on my helicopter so I have to anticipate 

00:02:55.500 --> 00:02:58.770
 still we rocket it was 

00:02:57.540 --> 00:03:00.330
 past it takes more beautiful CVs 

00:02:58.770 --> 00:03:02.940
 sequences of the game each time 

00:03:00.330 --> 00:03:04.740
 what is less is easy enough 

00:03:02.940 --> 00:03:07.770
 still nickel is time that if the 

00:03:04.740 --> 00:03:09.739
 guy in the gunner underneath the shoots at 

00:03:07.770 --> 00:03:11.940
 bottom on also it's pretty handy 

00:03:09.739 --> 00:03:13.890
 after you have to be careful not to scratch 

00:03:11.940 --> 00:03:15.150
 and so you see me I put the 

00:03:13.890 --> 00:03:16.500
 rockets the first queries the 

00:03:15.150 --> 00:03:17.580
 roads and hydra are fourteen she 

00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:20.850
 suggested so quickly 

00:03:17.580 --> 00:03:22.020
 Then there are the units had we have 8 and the 

00:03:20.850 --> 00:03:24.030
 flow is a bit slower but they 

00:03:22.020 --> 00:03:25.709
 will do a little worse and to the requests 

00:03:24.030 --> 00:03:28.230
 intelligent who was heading to the 

00:03:25.709 --> 00:03:29.070
 target finally towards a target but good must 

00:03:28.230 --> 00:03:30.180
 whether relatives 

00:03:29.070 --> 00:03:32.550
 so you see there I spit 

00:03:30.180 --> 00:03:33.480
 seller after 10:30 heaven and that's it 

00:03:32.550 --> 00:03:37.170
 the guy in the gunner who had lived 

00:03:33.480 --> 00:03:39.450
 we are talking to each other and so we have to go 

00:03:37.170 --> 00:03:41.940
 the hydra for me is the top 

00:03:39.450 --> 00:03:43.470
 so with the normal time I put 

00:03:41.940 --> 00:03:46.050
 not the burner cme because the 

00:03:43.470 --> 00:03:48.170
 fog cm x do not wait until 

00:03:46.050 --> 00:03:49.849
 the missiles come on you for 

00:03:48.170 --> 00:03:51.650
 to activate it in fact must activate it 

00:03:49.849 --> 00:03:56.030
 a fake as soon as you do locked 

00:03:51.650 --> 00:03:57.260
 so I do not like it too much after he 

00:03:56.030 --> 00:03:58.730
 seems like that's all I think I 've 

00:03:57.260 --> 00:04:00.680
 stabilizer when I can believe but 

00:03:58.730 --> 00:04:01.940
 it's not moving too much, I do not think so 

00:04:00.680 --> 00:04:03.020
 that's great you saw him in the 

00:04:01.940 --> 00:04:05.270
 part I think I have no more 

00:04:03.020 --> 00:04:06.400
 missile also get away entrances from 

00:04:05.270 --> 00:04:08.840
 buildings etc 

00:04:06.400 --> 00:04:10.480
 and then here after in the gunner I 

00:04:08.840 --> 00:04:13.880
 know that I put a load on the band 

00:04:10.480 --> 00:04:15.739
 and it seems to me that it is so I 

00:04:13.880 --> 00:04:17.959
 say no bullshit and laser guidance 

00:04:15.739 --> 00:04:18.980
 the omd for tanks and who will pay I 

00:04:17.959 --> 00:04:20.780
 think it's better when we're in 

00:04:18.980 --> 00:04:23.120
 a new game see there I still shot 

00:04:20.780 --> 00:04:24.139
 missiles true point that stressed 

00:04:23.120 --> 00:04:27.290
 words that you see I was in good 

00:04:24.139 --> 00:04:28.550
 series f also always tried to be at 

00:04:27.290 --> 00:04:29.810
 above the enemy so that's why 

00:04:28.550 --> 00:04:31.010
 that I go back to death I wait for them to me 

00:04:29.810 --> 00:04:34.700
 lob I see missiles from I loose 

00:04:31.010 --> 00:04:36.650
 I've had them since I've had a good time 

00:04:34.700 --> 00:04:38.120
 played the semec in the gunner also physio 

00:04:36.650 --> 00:04:40.280
 all the customers who did that's true 

00:04:38.120 --> 00:04:41.660
 that it is a little relook but that's it 

00:04:40.280 --> 00:04:42.830
 it was pretty hot there because I 

00:04:41.660 --> 00:04:45.530
 would say even if they do anything and he 

00:04:42.830 --> 00:04:45.919
 could have easily broken me the jeanne 

00:04:45.530 --> 00:04:48.169
 bow 

00:04:45.919 --> 00:04:49.910
 I want it's like you like it, you're 

00:04:48.169 --> 00:04:52.160
 they are on the small skis jets 

00:04:49.910 --> 00:04:53.240
 frankly it's not bad but it's 

00:04:52.160 --> 00:04:54.320
 true that on the other maps and its 

00:04:53.240 --> 00:04:55.550
 roles where guys who are blocking all 

00:04:54.320 --> 00:04:57.500
 the 3 seconds and you can do nothing 

00:04:55.550 --> 00:04:59.120
 especially you can not do yourself 

00:04:57.500 --> 00:05:01.220
 repair since the craft so gunner 

00:04:59.120 --> 00:05:03.890
 here he is not on the edge of the chopper 

00:05:01.220 --> 00:05:05.510
 like the recognition codes or the 

00:05:03.890 --> 00:05:07.669
 here you can have one or more 

00:05:05.510 --> 00:05:10.280
 people who would not like but good 

00:05:07.669 --> 00:05:11.990
 that's pretty cool anyway 

00:05:10.280 --> 00:05:13.550
 to do a whole lot in the lives 

00:05:11.990 --> 00:05:16.400
 we stop these big horns enough 

00:05:13.550 --> 00:05:18.430
 horatio but you have to know the pilot 

00:05:16.400 --> 00:05:20.020
 still a minimum I think 

00:05:18.430 --> 00:05:22.000
 do the right good trips to 

00:05:20.020 --> 00:05:23.410
 to pass like everything is like when you 

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:24.390
 are on foot must do the right 

00:05:23.410 --> 00:05:26.650
 trips 

00:05:24.390 --> 00:05:28.030
 you have to try out spots at max of 

00:05:26.650 --> 00:05:29.770
 people too because there are guys 

00:05:28.030 --> 00:05:30.880
 in the spot parts person that's 

00:05:29.770 --> 00:05:33.700
 may not be the vehicles so I 

00:05:30.880 --> 00:05:35.080
 do not understand but maybe it's 

00:05:33.700 --> 00:05:36.430
 not touch finally short I hope that 

00:05:35.080 --> 00:05:37.600
 it is a video you will have liked on this 

00:05:36.430 --> 00:05:39.340
 drawing small comment a little 

00:05:37.600 --> 00:05:41.830
 tenth and tell me what you 

00:05:39.340 --> 00:05:42.190
 think of this new series and good 

00:05:41.830 --> 00:05:45.420
 evening 

00:05:42.190 --> 00:05:45.420
 good day ciao bye
