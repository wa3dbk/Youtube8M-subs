00:00:28.110 --> 00:00:32.430
 I'm trying and it's called surfing 

00:00:29.940 --> 00:00:35.970

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:37.050
 south barium is an apocalyptic m sweater 

00:00:35.970 --> 00:00:38.940
 that is developed the guys from 

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:41.130
 Boston games that puts us in a world 

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:42.989
 let's say that ecological disasters and 

00:00:41.130 --> 00:00:46.220
 biological they have fucked our lives and 

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:47.810
 we will have to survive in it 

00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:51.370
 that is to say, it looks a lot like being 

00:00:47.810 --> 00:00:51.370
 because the player has a pint 

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:59.130
 take good things and bad things and 

00:00:56.670 --> 00:01:01.290
 implement ideas good new ideas 

00:00:59.130 --> 00:01:05.180
 sorry is to say that what we are 

00:01:01.290 --> 00:01:05.180
 Trying right now is the close espeta 

00:01:06.650 --> 00:01:13.020
 on the website of the website and a 

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:14.760
 link to a page where we are 

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:17.130
 giving codes there were not many 

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:19.560
 there were about 900 left and so if you do not have 

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:21.180
 Today, on twitter, I can continue and 

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:22.470
 you can get more codes every time 

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:24.710
 that they see them I do not usually have 

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:27.420
 twitter good to tell you that the game 

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:29.940
 let's say you have three game modes 

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:31.320
 that will be the gameplay the pri play the cob 

00:01:29.940 --> 00:01:33.290
 right now only the team is available 

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:35.610
 play that we say in the pspv 

00:01:33.290 --> 00:01:37.740
 you can develop the character position 

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:40.350
 As you can see here you have a tree 

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:42.240
 development where it can increase according to 

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:43.560
 go up the level we will have several 

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:44.790
 Factions to choose an inventory 

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:47.250
 pretty full where you can go 

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:48.690
 equipping and monitoring the weight according to 

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:51.180
 VallÃ©s arrived level up 

00:01:48.690 --> 00:01:53.640
 you can go unlocking what they are 

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:56.160
 new new armor things

00:01:56.160 --> 00:02:00.580
 ammunition and you in sucre that's what 

00:01:58.649 --> 00:02:02.590
 they are camouflages and all this 

00:02:00.580 --> 00:02:05.500
 you will have to think about how to equip 

00:02:02.590 --> 00:02:06.880
 your doll for battle too 

00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:08.380
 you can be imputed by the maps 

00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:10.780
 anomalies and artifacts that also 

00:02:08.380 --> 00:02:13.390
 let's say they are a bonus 

00:02:10.780 --> 00:02:15.880
 you can also equip them and they will give you 

00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:18.700
 benefits and increase your 

00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:22.480
 attitudes of saying what I have commented 

00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:23.770
 the development of the character also to 

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:25.450
 see the features and clearings of the 

00:02:23.770 --> 00:02:26.680
 features as you can see here now 

00:02:25.450 --> 00:02:28.600
 same there are four but fort something 

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:31.060
 available that are black pickles 

00:02:28.600 --> 00:02:36.610
 Tuesday the army of birth and 

00:02:31.060 --> 00:02:38.770
 items good as the feeling is said 

00:02:36.610 --> 00:02:40.600
 what you want to say but neither does 

00:02:38.770 --> 00:02:44.110
 missing it once you get it is a 

00:02:40.600 --> 00:02:45.790
 faction then what this faction of 

00:02:44.110 --> 00:02:47.170
 missions that you are fulfilling let's say 

00:02:45.790 --> 00:02:49.900
 in achievements mode that you are fulfilling 

00:02:47.170 --> 00:02:52.209
 when you go to battle and so you can go 

00:02:49.900 --> 00:02:53.740
 let's also say increasing our 

00:02:52.209 --> 00:02:54.160
 possibilities of developing new 

00:02:53.740 --> 00:02:57.850
 things 

00:02:54.160 --> 00:02:59.260
 once you have here let's say to the 

00:02:57.850 --> 00:03:00.970
 cruise market to faction os vais 

00:02:59.260 --> 00:03:02.890
 to the market and in your market 

00:03:00.970 --> 00:03:05.330
 faction you can go as you go up to 

00:03:02.890 --> 00:03:07.030
 level as I said new weapons 

00:03:05.330 --> 00:03:11.180
 New missions clothes new armors 

00:03:07.030 --> 00:03:12.920
 helmets and all this and it's very good what 

00:03:11.180 --> 00:03:15.110
 which is the equipment mode of 

00:03:12.920 --> 00:03:16.850
 inventory you can also create what 

00:03:15.110 --> 00:03:18.950
 it's the clothes you buy what are the 

00:03:16.850 --> 00:03:20.930
 weapons and all this in for example mode 

00:03:18.950 --> 00:03:30.530
 groups can put you camouflage 

00:03:20.930 --> 00:03:34.010
 You can put battles and 

00:03:30.530 --> 00:03:36.380
 missions and that is very very very very 

00:03:34.010 --> 00:03:39.200
 achieved the truth that I'm liking 

00:03:36.380 --> 00:03:42.070
 much the game even though not only 

00:03:39.200 --> 00:03:44.690
 transforming what is some equipment 

00:03:42.070 --> 00:03:46.420
 you will have to pick up some 

00:03:44.690 --> 00:03:49.880
 artifacts that are let's say 

00:03:46.420 --> 00:03:52.100
 mechanisms or parts for radio 

00:03:49.880 --> 00:03:54.200
 to get into your base are 

00:03:52.100 --> 00:03:56.750
 scattered on the map you will have to 

00:03:54.200 --> 00:03:58.250
 take them to your base and that is 

00:03:56.750 --> 00:03:59.680
 will be giving victory points as well 

00:03:58.250 --> 00:04:03.640
 say it 

00:03:59.680 --> 00:04:06.730
 What else can I say, what 

00:04:03.640 --> 00:04:10.120
 right now what you can see is 

00:04:06.730 --> 00:04:11.590
 I'm really enjoying it a lot 

00:04:10.120 --> 00:04:15.050
 the game have a lot more 

00:04:11.590 --> 00:04:19.130
 complication of what it looks like and what 

00:04:15.050 --> 00:04:21.690
 even though it has the mode 

00:04:19.130 --> 00:04:23.940
 pvp say so now because I 

00:04:21.690 --> 00:04:25.289
 he's really liking me, I'm still missing 

00:04:23.940 --> 00:04:26.970
 the following modes which is the 

00:04:25.289 --> 00:04:29.789
 cooperative and the fried and the free play 

00:04:26.970 --> 00:04:30.960
 let's say in survival and hard 

00:04:29.789 --> 00:04:33.690
 I guess the free play will be also 

00:04:30.960 --> 00:04:36.900
 to be able to play with friends and there you 

00:04:33.690 --> 00:04:40.050
 you face and let's say different things 

00:04:36.900 --> 00:04:43.199
 you have to explore evolve for there 

00:04:40.050 --> 00:04:44.669
 to do everything to fight on everything 

00:04:43.199 --> 00:04:46.590
 game that looks good that 

00:04:44.669 --> 00:04:48.660
 promises to remember that it is free to play and 

00:04:46.590 --> 00:04:51.539
 that you will not have to pay a hard for him 

00:04:48.660 --> 00:04:52.770
 and in which you can try new things 

00:04:51.539 --> 00:04:54.660
 since this is fashionable 

00:04:52.770 --> 00:04:56.250
 survival here without zombies moments 

00:04:54.660 --> 00:04:59.400
 I have not seen strange bugs anything more 

00:04:56.250 --> 00:05:01.080
 also a mirror and it does not seem that 

00:04:59.400 --> 00:05:03.960
 we have to put at least in mode 

00:05:01.080 --> 00:05:05.789
 pvp but yes they promise weird little things 

00:05:03.960 --> 00:05:07.199
 well yes there are in the well-off 

00:05:05.789 --> 00:05:10.340
 and that there are areas of the map where there 

00:05:07.199 --> 00:05:12.620
 rare anomalies like you can see like this 

00:05:10.340 --> 00:05:14.690
 that you can kill us they can kill 

00:05:12.620 --> 00:05:16.430
 the enemies the maps the maps are 

00:05:14.690 --> 00:05:20.720
 very well achieved the sound is me 

00:05:16.430 --> 00:05:22.760
 I really like it very much 

00:05:20.720 --> 00:05:24.500
 pint we got this cover came with 

00:05:22.760 --> 00:05:26.060
 good lighting a good quality 

00:05:24.500 --> 00:05:28.150
 graphic I'm playing a quality 

00:05:26.060 --> 00:05:30.199
 medium high to be a beta classes is 

00:05:28.150 --> 00:05:32.810
 pretty good performance does not give me 

00:05:30.199 --> 00:05:35.240
 no problem there is some look for another 

00:05:32.810 --> 00:05:38.720
 that comes to the desk that but very 

00:05:35.240 --> 00:05:40.639
 once in a while but for less and as 

00:05:38.720 --> 00:05:43.430
 you can see here the enemies are 

00:05:40.639 --> 00:05:45.919
 approved and friendly fire but yes that 

00:05:43.430 --> 00:05:49.400
 you have to be careful because you 

00:05:45.919 --> 00:05:51.229
 can here there is good sun can you catch and 

00:05:49.400 --> 00:05:54.020
 the armor depends on the clothes that you 

00:05:51.229 --> 00:05:57.080
 take and how it is evolving so 

00:05:54.020 --> 00:05:59.690
 nothing I leave you with surf valium if you have 

00:05:57.080 --> 00:06:01.280

00:05:59.690 --> 00:06:03.530
 in the description of the video to be able 

00:06:01.280 --> 00:06:04.970
 download it and be able to try it and if not 

00:06:03.530 --> 00:06:06.289
 we wait for news because in a game 

00:06:04.970 --> 00:06:08.060
 that promises that I like that is 

00:06:06.289 --> 00:06:10.070
 liking and that there will be more videos in the 

00:06:08.060 --> 00:06:13.100
 channel so here I leave you with this 

00:06:10.070 --> 00:06:14.900
