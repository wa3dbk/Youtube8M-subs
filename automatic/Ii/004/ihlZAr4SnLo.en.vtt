00:04:15.910 --> 00:04:15.920 

00:04:15.920 --> 00:04:20.729 

the<00:04:16.920> outside<00:04:17.340> is<00:04:17.370> is<00:04:18.060> pretty<00:04:18.570> good<00:04:18.870> you<00:04:19.830> know

00:04:24.420 --> 00:04:24.430 
the finish is quite nice here but the

00:04:24.430 --> 00:04:26.100 
the finish is quite nice here but the
problems<00:04:24.850> is<00:04:25.030> when<00:04:25.150> you<00:04:25.300> fit<00:04:25.569> they<00:04:25.750> have<00:04:25.780> a<00:04:25.900> bit

00:04:26.100 --> 00:04:26.110 
problems is when you fit they have a bit

00:04:26.110 --> 00:04:29.339 
problems is when you fit they have a bit
here<00:04:26.410> that<00:04:27.009> doesn't<00:04:27.310> work<00:04:27.430> too<00:04:27.610> well<00:04:28.349> I'll

00:04:29.339 --> 00:04:29.349 
here that doesn't work too well I'll

00:04:29.349 --> 00:04:54.950 
here that doesn't work too well I'll
just<00:04:29.620> get<00:04:29.800> that<00:04:37.680> so<00:04:40.410> trying<00:04:41.410> to<00:04:41.590> fit<00:04:42.300> this<00:04:46.979> here

00:04:54.950 --> 00:04:54.960 

00:04:54.960 --> 00:04:59.939 

this<00:04:55.960> slot<00:04:56.259> here<00:04:58.020> doesn't<00:04:59.020> go<00:04:59.139> well<00:04:59.349> with<00:04:59.380> this

00:04:59.939 --> 00:04:59.949 
this slot here doesn't go well with this

00:04:59.949 --> 00:05:11.879 
this slot here doesn't go well with this
it<00:05:00.699> doesn't<00:05:01.000> fit<00:05:01.120> him<00:05:01.330> properly<00:05:10.470> you<00:05:11.470> can<00:05:11.650> see

00:05:11.879 --> 00:05:11.889 
it doesn't fit him properly you can see

00:05:11.889 --> 00:05:19.589 
it doesn't fit him properly you can see
that<00:05:13.349> the<00:05:14.349> hole<00:05:14.590> here<00:05:15.039> is<00:05:15.340> meant<00:05:15.639> to<00:05:18.150> this<00:05:19.150> and

00:05:19.589 --> 00:05:19.599 
that the hole here is meant to this and

00:05:19.599 --> 00:05:21.779 
that the hole here is meant to this and
this<00:05:20.409> are<00:05:20.650> meant<00:05:20.800> to<00:05:20.860> come<00:05:21.099> through<00:05:21.340> here<00:05:21.610> and

00:05:21.779 --> 00:05:21.789 
this are meant to come through here and

00:05:21.789 --> 00:05:25.529 
this are meant to come through here and
here<00:05:22.080> but<00:05:23.080> they<00:05:23.229> don't<00:05:23.970> so<00:05:24.970> that's<00:05:25.240> quite

00:05:25.529 --> 00:05:25.539 
here but they don't so that's quite

00:05:25.539 --> 00:05:28.499 
here but they don't so that's quite
annoying<00:05:26.039> so<00:05:27.039> it's<00:05:27.159> not<00:05:27.310> a<00:05:27.370> hundred<00:05:28.330> percent

00:05:28.499 --> 00:05:28.509 
annoying so it's not a hundred percent

00:05:28.509 --> 00:05:33.689 
annoying so it's not a hundred percent
fit<00:05:31.800> so<00:05:32.800> you're<00:05:32.979> not<00:05:33.130> really<00:05:33.310> happy<00:05:33.520> about

00:05:33.689 --> 00:05:33.699 
fit so you're not really happy about

00:05:33.699 --> 00:05:45.810 
fit so you're not really happy about
that<00:05:33.880> either<00:05:38.669> then<00:05:41.820> we've<00:05:42.820> got<00:05:44.159> the<00:05:45.159> finish<00:05:45.580> of

00:05:45.810 --> 00:05:45.820 
that either then we've got the finish of

00:05:45.820 --> 00:05:55.110 
that either then we've got the finish of
this<00:05:46.440> which<00:05:47.440> is<00:05:47.469> really<00:05:48.099> quite<00:05:48.759> shabby

00:05:55.110 --> 00:05:55.120 

00:05:55.120 --> 00:05:59.610 

this<00:05:56.100> bit<00:05:57.100> here<00:05:57.400> was<00:05:57.820> already<00:05:57.970> broken<00:05:58.590> when<00:05:59.590> I

00:05:59.610 --> 00:05:59.620 
this bit here was already broken when I

00:05:59.620 --> 00:06:07.820 
this bit here was already broken when I
got<00:05:59.889> it<00:06:00.040> seeing<00:06:00.910> with<00:06:01.150> here<00:06:02.250> so<00:06:04.169> overall<00:06:05.169> I

00:06:07.820 --> 00:06:07.830 

00:06:07.830 --> 00:06:13.740 

wasn't<00:06:08.830> happy<00:06:09.010> of<00:06:09.220> this<00:06:12.180> the<00:06:13.180> finish<00:06:13.540> all

00:06:13.740 --> 00:06:13.750 
wasn't happy of this the finish all

00:06:13.750 --> 00:06:19.140 
wasn't happy of this the finish all
around<00:06:13.990> here<00:06:14.290> is<00:06:14.470> good<00:06:15.630> here<00:06:16.630> is<00:06:16.840> okay<00:06:18.090> but<00:06:19.090> I

00:06:19.140 --> 00:06:19.150 
around here is good here is okay but I

00:06:19.150 --> 00:06:24.830 
around here is good here is okay but I
doubt<00:06:19.919> whether<00:06:20.919> it's<00:06:21.310> gonna<00:06:21.520> fit<00:06:22.680> because

00:06:24.830 --> 00:06:24.840 
doubt whether it's gonna fit because

00:06:24.840 --> 00:06:28.260 
doubt whether it's gonna fit because
this<00:06:25.840> bit<00:06:26.110> this<00:06:27.010> bit<00:06:27.070> here<00:06:27.370> is<00:06:27.460> broken<00:06:27.760> it's

00:06:28.260 --> 00:06:28.270 
this bit this bit here is broken it's

00:06:28.270 --> 00:06:34.020 
this bit this bit here is broken it's
not<00:06:28.449> like<00:06:28.600> this<00:06:29.010> can<00:06:30.010> you<00:06:30.100> see<00:06:30.130> that<00:06:31.710> yeah<00:06:33.030> you

00:06:34.020 --> 00:06:34.030 
not like this can you see that yeah you

00:06:34.030 --> 00:06:36.659 
not like this can you see that yeah you
can<00:06:34.180> see<00:06:34.330> that<00:06:34.360> it's<00:06:34.660> broken<00:06:34.870> there<00:06:35.289> and<00:06:35.669> the

00:06:36.659 --> 00:06:36.669 
can see that it's broken there and the

00:06:36.669 --> 00:06:41.939 
can see that it's broken there and the
same<00:06:36.940> for<00:06:37.330> here<00:06:37.620> and<00:06:38.620> up<00:06:38.800> here<00:06:39.570> so<00:06:40.949> that's

00:06:41.939 --> 00:06:41.949 
same for here and up here so that's

00:06:41.949 --> 00:06:53.100 
same for here and up here so that's
really<00:06:42.190> quite<00:06:42.460> bad<00:06:45.419> and<00:06:51.479> even<00:06:52.479> if<00:06:52.630> you<00:06:52.780> try<00:06:53.050> to

00:06:53.100 --> 00:06:53.110 
really quite bad and even if you try to

00:06:53.110 --> 00:07:01.670 
really quite bad and even if you try to
fit<00:06:53.699> this<00:06:54.699> in<00:06:55.000> here<00:06:59.970> this<00:07:00.970> doesn't<00:07:01.419> come<00:07:01.630> down

00:07:01.670 --> 00:07:01.680 
fit this in here this doesn't come down

00:07:01.680 --> 00:07:14.100 
fit this in here this doesn't come down
properly<00:07:03.660> into<00:07:08.580> into<00:07:09.580> this<00:07:09.700> area<00:07:10.060> here<00:07:10.770> so<00:07:13.110> it

00:07:14.100 --> 00:07:14.110 
properly into into this area here so it

00:07:14.110 --> 00:07:15.620 
properly into into this area here so it
looks<00:07:14.410> like<00:07:14.560> I'm<00:07:14.710> gonna<00:07:14.800> have<00:07:14.889> to<00:07:15.039> buy<00:07:15.220> a

00:07:15.630 --> 00:07:21.570 
looks like I'm gonna have to buy a
proper<00:07:16.630> or<00:07:17.590> we<00:07:17.860> amber<00:07:18.280> yeah<00:07:19.919> yeah<00:07:20.919> I'm<00:07:21.160> really

00:07:24.570 --> 00:07:24.580 
not happy at all this I think it's it's

00:07:24.580 --> 00:07:27.210 
not happy at all this I think it's it's
just<00:07:24.699> badly<00:07:25.090> made<00:07:25.710> particularly<00:07:26.710> the<00:07:26.800> fit<00:07:27.010> in

00:07:27.210 --> 00:07:27.220 
just badly made particularly the fit in

00:07:27.220 --> 00:07:30.600 
just badly made particularly the fit in
the<00:07:28.180> finish<00:07:28.510> is<00:07:28.660> average<00:07:29.110> good<00:07:29.919> in<00:07:30.039> some<00:07:30.250> areas

00:07:30.600 --> 00:07:30.610 
the finish is average good in some areas

00:07:30.610 --> 00:07:34.650 
the finish is average good in some areas
but<00:07:30.639> not<00:07:31.030> great<00:07:31.300> everywhere<00:07:31.690> else<00:07:33.510> so<00:07:34.510> I'm

00:07:34.650 --> 00:07:34.660 
but not great everywhere else so I'm

00:07:34.660 --> 00:07:37.020 
but not great everywhere else so I'm
kind<00:07:34.840> of<00:07:34.870> reluctant<00:07:35.169> to<00:07:35.500> fit<00:07:35.800> any<00:07:36.699> of<00:07:36.849> this

00:07:37.020 --> 00:07:37.030 
kind of reluctant to fit any of this

00:07:37.030 --> 00:07:38.490 
kind of reluctant to fit any of this
song<00:07:37.240> because<00:07:37.539> I<00:07:37.660> doubt<00:07:37.900> where<00:07:38.080> they<00:07:38.169> all<00:07:38.289> fit

00:07:38.490 --> 00:07:38.500 
song because I doubt where they all fit

00:07:38.500 --> 00:07:41.640 
song because I doubt where they all fit
on<00:07:38.620> the<00:07:38.710> bike<00:07:38.860> properly<00:07:40.020> yeah<00:07:41.020> these<00:07:41.260> parts
