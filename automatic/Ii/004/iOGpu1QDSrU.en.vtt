00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:16.399 
I think it would have been very
understandable<00:01:15.000> but<00:01:15.150> the<00:01:15.270> fact<00:01:15.479> that<00:01:15.600> it

00:01:16.399 --> 00:01:16.409 
understandable but the fact that it

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:19.520 
understandable but the fact that it
wasn't<00:01:16.650> a<00:01:16.830> woman<00:01:16.950> was<00:01:17.580> what<00:01:18.119> made<00:01:18.330> it<00:01:18.530> so
