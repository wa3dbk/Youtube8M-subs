just<00:02:15.780> opening<00:02:16.290> up<00:02:16.379> my<00:02:16.560> leo<00:02:16.890> Vinci<00:02:18.890> exhaust<00:02:20.180> of

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:21.180 
just opening up my leo Vinci exhaust of

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:25.720 
just opening up my leo Vinci exhaust of
course<00:02:21.420> this<00:02:21.569> from<00:02:21.750> my<00:02:21.870> Duke<00:02:22.610> says<00:02:23.610> right<00:02:23.879> here

00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:25.730 
course this from my Duke says right here

00:02:25.730 --> 00:02:28.369 
course this from my Duke says right here
comes<00:02:26.730> with<00:02:26.879> one<00:02:27.090> stainless<00:02:27.569> steel<00:02:27.840> silenced

00:02:28.369 --> 00:02:28.379 
comes with one stainless steel silenced

00:02:28.379 --> 00:02:32.110 
comes with one stainless steel silenced
there<00:02:28.590> one<00:02:29.040> head<00:02:29.310> pipe<00:02:29.750> header<00:02:30.750> pipe

00:02:32.110 --> 00:02:32.120 
there one head pipe header pipe

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:37.009 
there one head pipe header pipe
carbon-fiber<00:02:33.120> back<00:02:33.450> it<00:02:33.799> spring<00:02:35.840> the<00:02:36.840> one

00:02:37.009 --> 00:02:37.019 
carbon-fiber back it spring the one

00:02:37.019 --> 00:02:38.570 
carbon-fiber back it spring the one
header<00:02:37.379> pipe<00:02:37.650> I<00:02:37.890> don't<00:02:38.099> know<00:02:38.220> what<00:02:38.340> that<00:02:38.549> is

00:02:38.570 --> 00:02:38.580 
header pipe I don't know what that is

00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:40.910 
header pipe I don't know what that is
I'll<00:02:39.299> figure<00:02:39.660> it<00:02:39.810> out<00:02:40.019> right<00:02:40.260> now<00:02:40.470> let's<00:02:40.739> see

00:02:40.910 --> 00:02:40.920 
I'll figure it out right now let's see

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:41.539 
I'll figure it out right now let's see
what<00:02:41.069> we<00:02:41.190> got

00:02:41.539 --> 00:02:41.549 
what we got

00:02:41.549 --> 00:02:49.759 
what we got
I<00:02:42.170> thought<00:02:43.170> this<00:02:43.290> was<00:02:43.470> just<00:02:43.500> a<00:02:43.769> slip<00:02:44.010> on<00:02:48.769> so

00:02:49.759 --> 00:02:49.769 
I thought this was just a slip on so

00:02:49.769 --> 00:02:57.819 
I thought this was just a slip on so
that's<00:02:49.950> what<00:02:50.160> you<00:02:50.370> can<00:02:50.670> expect<00:02:56.120> better<00:02:57.120> pipe

00:02:57.819 --> 00:02:57.829 
that's what you can expect better pipe

00:02:57.829 --> 00:02:59.960 
that's what you can expect better pipe
well<00:02:58.829> that's<00:02:58.980> not<00:02:59.130> the<00:02:59.280> header<00:02:59.430> pipe<00:02:59.519> that's

00:02:59.960 --> 00:02:59.970 
well that's not the header pipe that's

00:02:59.970 --> 00:03:06.530 
well that's not the header pipe that's
the<00:03:03.349> made<00:03:04.349> a<00:03:04.380> carbon<00:03:04.799> fiber<00:03:05.299> at<00:03:06.299> the

00:03:06.530 --> 00:03:06.540 
the made a carbon fiber at the

00:03:06.540 --> 00:03:08.240 
the made a carbon fiber at the
instructions<00:03:07.200> right<00:03:07.379> here<00:03:07.440> I<00:03:07.739> think<00:03:08.129> that's

00:03:08.240 --> 00:03:08.250 
instructions right here I think that's

00:03:08.250 --> 00:03:15.009 
instructions right here I think that's
kind<00:03:08.579> of<00:03:08.640> self-explanatory<00:03:11.180> stickers

00:03:15.009 --> 00:03:15.019 

00:03:15.019 --> 00:03:28.610 

hardware<00:03:16.019> oh<00:03:23.329> and<00:03:24.329> here<00:03:24.600> we<00:03:24.750> go<00:03:27.319> it's<00:03:28.319> all<00:03:28.470> in

00:03:28.610 --> 00:03:28.620 
hardware oh and here we go it's all in

00:03:28.620 --> 00:03:32.890 
hardware oh and here we go it's all in
Italian

00:03:32.890 --> 00:03:32.900 

00:03:32.900 --> 00:03:35.600 

they<00:03:33.900> do<00:03:33.960> everything<00:03:34.770> make<00:03:35.070> sure<00:03:35.310> that<00:03:35.490> it

00:03:35.600 --> 00:03:35.610 
they do everything make sure that it

00:03:35.610 --> 00:03:41.080 
they do everything make sure that it
doesn't<00:03:35.820> get<00:03:36.300> dented<00:03:37.820> ships<00:03:39.710> there<00:03:40.710> you<00:03:40.860> go

00:03:41.080 --> 00:03:41.090 
doesn't get dented ships there you go

00:03:41.090 --> 00:03:45.160 
doesn't get dented ships there you go
here's<00:03:42.090> the<00:03:42.270> pike

00:03:45.160 --> 00:03:45.170 

00:03:45.170 --> 00:03:52.660 

almost<00:03:46.170> like<00:03:46.350> stock<00:03:50.150> overall<00:03:51.150> impression

00:03:52.660 --> 00:03:52.670 
almost like stock overall impression

00:03:52.670 --> 00:03:59.680 
almost like stock overall impression
well<00:03:53.670> worth<00:03:53.850> the<00:03:54.060> money<00:03:55.490> well<00:03:56.490> I<00:03:56.520> like<00:03:56.910> it<00:03:58.370> and

00:03:59.680 --> 00:03:59.690 
well worth the money well I like it and

00:03:59.690 --> 00:04:02.540 
well worth the money well I like it and
it<00:04:00.690> has<00:04:00.900> this<00:04:01.080> little<00:04:01.320> silencer<00:04:02.010> stuck<00:04:02.400> in

00:04:02.540 --> 00:04:02.550 
it has this little silencer stuck in

00:04:02.550 --> 00:04:06.320 
it has this little silencer stuck in
there<00:04:03.140> so<00:04:04.140> I<00:04:04.290> guess<00:04:04.590> if<00:04:05.550> you<00:04:05.610> want<00:04:05.910> to<00:04:06.000> take<00:04:06.180> it

00:04:06.320 --> 00:04:06.330 
there so I guess if you want to take it

00:04:06.330 --> 00:04:10.130 
there so I guess if you want to take it
out<00:04:07.790> and<00:04:08.790> just<00:04:08.820> get<00:04:09.360> an<00:04:09.450> Allen<00:04:09.780> wrench<00:04:09.810> in

00:04:10.130 --> 00:04:10.140 
out and just get an Allen wrench in

00:04:10.140 --> 00:04:14.240 
out and just get an Allen wrench in
there<00:04:10.410> and<00:04:11.120> so<00:04:12.120> what<00:04:12.270> I<00:04:12.300> do<00:04:12.420> first<00:04:12.810> is<00:04:13.250> this

00:04:14.240 --> 00:04:14.250 
there and so what I do first is this

00:04:14.250 --> 00:04:16.100 
there and so what I do first is this
little<00:04:14.610> hook<00:04:14.880> thing<00:04:15.180> you<00:04:15.510> wonder<00:04:15.750> what<00:04:15.900> that's

00:04:16.100 --> 00:04:16.110 
little hook thing you wonder what that's

00:04:16.110 --> 00:04:20.449 
little hook thing you wonder what that's
for<00:04:18.200> well<00:04:19.200> it's<00:04:19.290> towards<00:04:19.590> the<00:04:19.770> spring<00:04:20.160> that

00:04:20.449 --> 00:04:20.459 
for well it's towards the spring that

00:04:20.459 --> 00:04:22.910 
for well it's towards the spring that
keeps<00:04:20.700> the<00:04:20.910> puck<00:04:21.120> together<00:04:21.510> all<00:04:22.470> you<00:04:22.620> do<00:04:22.770> is

00:04:22.910 --> 00:04:22.920 
keeps the puck together all you do is

00:04:22.920 --> 00:04:24.980 
keeps the puck together all you do is
basically<00:04:23.160> just<00:04:23.610> put<00:04:23.880> it<00:04:24.000> on<00:04:24.120> one<00:04:24.180> at<00:04:24.480> one<00:04:24.810> end

00:04:24.980 --> 00:04:24.990 
basically just put it on one at one end

00:04:24.990 --> 00:04:40.070 
basically just put it on one at one end
or<00:04:25.170> the<00:04:25.290> other<00:04:25.320> and<00:04:26.120> just<00:04:27.120> yank<00:04:27.420> it<00:04:27.690> and<00:04:39.080> pretty

00:04:40.070 --> 00:04:40.080 
or the other and just yank it and pretty

00:04:40.080 --> 00:04:46.280 
or the other and just yank it and pretty
much<00:04:40.370> this<00:04:41.370> unit<00:04:41.820> right<00:04:41.970> here<00:04:44.870> and<00:04:45.870> that's<00:04:46.110> how

00:04:46.280 --> 00:04:46.290 
much this unit right here and that's how

00:04:46.290 --> 00:04:52.730 
much this unit right here and that's how
it's<00:04:46.440> supposed<00:04:46.800> to<00:04:46.919> look<00:04:47.010> like<00:04:51.620> basically<00:04:52.620> I'm

00:04:52.730 --> 00:04:52.740 
it's supposed to look like basically I'm

00:04:52.740 --> 00:04:55.580 
it's supposed to look like basically I'm
just<00:04:52.970> kind<00:04:53.970> of<00:04:54.060> mocking<00:04:54.570> it<00:04:54.690> up<00:04:54.840> to<00:04:55.050> see<00:04:55.260> how<00:04:55.470> it

00:04:55.580 --> 00:04:55.590 
just kind of mocking it up to see how it

00:04:55.590 --> 00:05:03.470 
just kind of mocking it up to see how it
would<00:04:55.710> fit<00:04:56.300> then<00:04:58.580> I'll<00:04:59.580> bolt<00:05:00.030> it<00:05:00.210> up<00:05:02.480> alright

00:05:03.470 --> 00:05:03.480 
would fit then I'll bolt it up alright

00:05:03.480 --> 00:05:05.510 
would fit then I'll bolt it up alright
so<00:05:03.540> I<00:05:03.870> kind<00:05:04.290> of<00:05:04.380> decide<00:05:04.710> just<00:05:04.980> to<00:05:05.100> put<00:05:05.280> it<00:05:05.400> on

00:05:05.510 --> 00:05:05.520 
so I kind of decide just to put it on

00:05:05.520 --> 00:05:09.070 
so I kind of decide just to put it on
here<00:05:07.010> so<00:05:08.010> it<00:05:08.100> goes<00:05:08.280> like<00:05:08.460> this

00:05:09.070 --> 00:05:09.080 
here so it goes like this

00:05:09.080 --> 00:05:12.200 
here so it goes like this
basically<00:05:10.080> this<00:05:10.350> a<00:05:10.680> carbon<00:05:11.430> fiber<00:05:11.640> wrap<00:05:11.910> just

00:05:12.200 --> 00:05:12.210 
basically this a carbon fiber wrap just

00:05:12.210 --> 00:05:14.810 
basically this a carbon fiber wrap just
kind<00:05:12.450> of<00:05:12.570> it<00:05:13.230> doesn't<00:05:13.560> spread<00:05:14.040> out<00:05:14.160> like<00:05:14.580> the

00:05:14.810 --> 00:05:14.820 
kind of it doesn't spread out like the

00:05:14.820 --> 00:05:18.710 
kind of it doesn't spread out like the
stock<00:05:15.780> unit<00:05:16.140> does<00:05:16.350> it<00:05:17.190> folds<00:05:18.030> up<00:05:18.180> and<00:05:18.419> it<00:05:18.540> just

00:05:18.710 --> 00:05:18.720 
stock unit does it folds up and it just

00:05:18.720 --> 00:05:21.350 
stock unit does it folds up and it just
hangs<00:05:18.960> the<00:05:19.860> exhaust<00:05:20.250> on<00:05:20.490> like<00:05:20.669> this<00:05:20.880> I<00:05:21.090> kind<00:05:21.330> of

00:05:21.350 --> 00:05:21.360 
hangs the exhaust on like this I kind of

00:05:21.360 --> 00:05:23.600 
hangs the exhaust on like this I kind of
just<00:05:21.540> mounted<00:05:21.930> it<00:05:22.080> didn't<00:05:23.040> tighten<00:05:23.190> it<00:05:23.400> yet

00:05:23.600 --> 00:05:23.610 
just mounted it didn't tighten it yet

00:05:23.610 --> 00:05:27.710 
just mounted it didn't tighten it yet
and<00:05:25.340> basically<00:05:26.340> put<00:05:26.550> it<00:05:26.640> right<00:05:26.730> down<00:05:26.910> there<00:05:27.180> so

00:05:27.710 --> 00:05:27.720 
and basically put it right down there so

00:05:27.720 --> 00:05:30.920 
and basically put it right down there so
it's<00:05:27.930> not<00:05:28.050> too<00:05:28.410> bad<00:05:28.440> it's<00:05:28.860> not<00:05:28.950> too<00:05:29.190> shabby<00:05:29.930> fit

00:05:30.920 --> 00:05:30.930 
it's not too bad it's not too shabby fit

00:05:30.930 --> 00:05:35.960 
it's not too bad it's not too shabby fit
finish<00:05:31.200> looks<00:05:31.440> pretty<00:05:31.680> good<00:05:31.940> and<00:05:32.940> yeah<00:05:34.970> I'll

00:05:35.960 --> 00:05:35.970 
finish looks pretty good and yeah I'll

00:05:35.970 --> 00:05:38.510 
finish looks pretty good and yeah I'll
go<00:05:36.150> ahead<00:05:36.240> and<00:05:36.450> tighten<00:05:36.600> it<00:05:36.780> up<00:05:36.960> and<00:05:37.430> start<00:05:38.430> her

00:05:38.510 --> 00:05:38.520 
go ahead and tighten it up and start her
