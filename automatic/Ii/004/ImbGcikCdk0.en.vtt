 [Music] 

00:00:09.590 --> 00:00:17.450
 hello youtube friends today I bring you a 

00:00:13.580 --> 00:00:20.390
 small little tutorial what 

00:00:17.450 --> 00:00:22.940
 is to fix a problem that does not come out 

00:00:20.390 --> 00:00:28.380
 slackness when trying to install 

00:00:22.940 --> 00:00:32.790
 something tells us that happened one 

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:36.290
 a problem and well this is only 

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:41.590
 for those who do not at the time of releasing their 

00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:46.090
 iphone or ipod touch did not erase the 

00:00:41.590 --> 00:00:49.870
 black there's no way they released her good 

00:00:46.090 --> 00:00:52.350
 so we 're going to black pain and what 

00:00:49.870 --> 00:00:54.730
 let's make is simple nothing more 

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:56.570
 we select Syria and we return it to 

00:00:54.730 --> 00:00:58.550
 reinstall 

00:00:56.570 --> 00:01:01.540
 and do not worry about what they have 

00:00:58.550 --> 00:01:05.650
 installed before 

00:01:01.540 --> 00:01:08.350
 things as well as they are cesc and all that 

00:01:05.650 --> 00:01:10.960
 is still going to be in cydia this what 

00:01:08.350 --> 00:01:14.350
 it does is refresh lazy memory 

00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:17.050
 so that it is again like new 

00:01:14.350 --> 00:01:18.759
 nothing is erased from us 

00:01:17.050 --> 00:01:23.140
 installed 

00:01:18.759 --> 00:01:23.140
 We hope you upload that idea 

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:28.810
 this is black rain is installing 

00:01:26.299 --> 00:01:28.810
 Syria 

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:36.610
 and we wait a little 

00:01:50.170 --> 00:01:54.509
 because and now we're leaving 

00:01:56.870 --> 00:01:59.980
 yes day 

00:02:02.180 --> 00:02:05.500
 now that day 

00:02:17.410 --> 00:02:25.960
 is going to make a break the iphone 

00:02:22.210 --> 00:02:28.090
 and when value to light we open Syria 

00:02:25.960 --> 00:02:29.800
 and totally fixed when we were 

00:02:28.090 --> 00:02:32.280
 to install something will no longer leave us 

00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:32.280
 that mistake
