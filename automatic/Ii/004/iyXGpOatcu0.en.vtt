00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:23.760
 Hello dear friends with you I am a crane 

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:26.070
 and today we look at tactics 

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:28.890
 position on the map who is not in 

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:32.489
 course then in patch 093 card completely 

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:34.620
 changed from the word quite earlier map 

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:37.890
 had such wonderful positions there 

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:41.309
 like one and two but often all were standing 

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:43.140
 bushes rather in the forest on the 8th and 9th lines but 

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:45.870
 now everything has changed and immediately 

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:48.449
 look at tactics on fast tanks in 

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:51.540
 in this case, batt and immediately fly 

00:00:48.449 --> 00:00:53.880
 on squares and 2nd trip and we become 

00:00:51.540 --> 00:00:56.850
 This bush also can this tactic 

00:00:53.880 --> 00:00:59.220
 use on us or us 

00:00:56.850 --> 00:01:01.200
 quick and haircuts can be on this mounds 

00:00:59.220 --> 00:01:03.239
 shine well as in principle and on 

00:01:01.200 --> 00:01:05.399
 previous version of the little one 

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:08.250
 go upstairs but now of course here 

00:01:05.399 --> 00:01:11.399
 all shoveled and many added hills 

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:13.110
 so itâ€™s not so easy to see everything. 

00:01:11.399 --> 00:01:15.360
 that taking this bush we immediately 

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:17.580
 we highlight all gravity she who 

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:20.460
 come here or go to 

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:22.979
 first-second line there on b 1 c 1 

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:24.569
 well lit and shot 

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:27.780
 but there are of course some nuances 

00:01:24.569 --> 00:01:30.090
 I especially noticed that in the new room 

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:31.830
 everyone loves to press the second and third 

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:34.259
 line that's basically here and 

00:01:31.830 --> 00:01:36.690
 a bunch of red ones demonstrated 

00:01:34.259 --> 00:01:38.670
 tanks that just want your calves 

00:01:36.690 --> 00:01:40.709
 our hero who highlights them and 

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:42.630
 a little bit selling come to life so if you 

00:01:40.709 --> 00:01:43.619
 on fast and you should be on fast 

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:46.080
 enough tanks 

00:01:43.619 --> 00:01:48.360
 here you are, for example, on batchata 

00:01:46.080 --> 00:01:50.729
 shoot off your drum and realizing that 

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:52.979
 enemies can at any time upon you 

00:01:50.729 --> 00:01:55.560
 sling just turn around and 

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:58.380
 start to leave well here 

00:01:55.560 --> 00:02:01.110
 you can get away very quickly and easily 

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:03.720
 here we are of course control t57 heavy but in 

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:05.550
 In general, we leave unscathed while 

00:02:03.720 --> 00:02:08.429
 highlighted all the enemies on the move 

00:02:05.550 --> 00:02:10.890
 a little shoot and with impunity so 

00:02:08.429 --> 00:02:13.620
 left the main thing to be attentive and not 

00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:16.230
 provtykal at the time well and now 

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:18.810
 let's see what you can do on the fast 

00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:22.500
 enough tanks from the upper respawn 

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:25.890
 for example and t-62a with well armored 

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:27.960
 the towers we immediately drive to squares c 1 d 

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:29.750
 1 but not trying too hard 

00:02:27.960 --> 00:02:31.670
 go deep because in the middle 

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:34.490
 the first-second line is the town 

00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:36.830
 it may be occupied by strands, therefore 

00:02:34.490 --> 00:02:39.440
 we don't go there we are right here 

00:02:36.830 --> 00:02:40.070
 trying to shine from the knoll see 

00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:42.470
 what are the enemies 

00:02:40.070 --> 00:02:44.930
 love to climb a hill or love 

00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:46.790
 ride to town is good for 

00:02:44.930 --> 00:02:49.000
 given position tanks with good 

00:02:46.790 --> 00:02:52.100
 armored turret with good angles 

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:54.560
 down so that the gun fell t-62 of course 

00:02:52.100 --> 00:02:56.270
 not superfood angles but the tower is enough 

00:02:54.560 --> 00:02:59.000
 armored and we have enough speed 

00:02:56.270 --> 00:03:01.730
 to quickly come here fit 

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:05.090
 let's admit also tyaz there e 5 in general 

00:03:01.730 --> 00:03:08.000
 You can diversify here any arrival 

00:03:05.090 --> 00:03:10.430
 tanks the main thing that we managed to drive off 

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:13.190
 but for that there it is 40 plus kilometers 

00:03:10.430 --> 00:03:15.560
 enough good here a bunch of whole hills and you 

00:03:13.190 --> 00:03:17.930
 can me if you are already starting to shine 

00:03:15.560 --> 00:03:20.330
 You can just shoot through 

00:03:17.930 --> 00:03:22.370
 take a turn and leave with it all 

00:03:20.330 --> 00:03:24.650
 there is a lot of good fire here 

00:03:22.370 --> 00:03:27.530
 There are a lot of hills too tanked through the tower 

00:03:24.650 --> 00:03:31.760
 but still you can shoot and dedicate 

00:03:27.530 --> 00:03:33.950
 also well and as for slow and 

00:03:31.760 --> 00:03:36.440
 armored tanks for you 

00:03:33.950 --> 00:03:39.320
 fit the position well, right close to 

00:03:36.440 --> 00:03:42.080
 bases you can occupy the second line under 

00:03:39.320 --> 00:03:43.820
 the hills and believe it as much as possible 

00:03:42.080 --> 00:03:45.320
 it will be effective for you because 

00:03:43.820 --> 00:03:48.290
 now we are at least the closest 

00:03:45.320 --> 00:03:50.600
 month exactly will be well such a trend in 

00:03:48.290 --> 00:03:53.120
 randomly on murovanka that often rashad 

00:03:50.600 --> 00:03:55.459
 first and second line and if you have 

00:03:53.120 --> 00:03:57.320
 good frontal armor you can here 

00:03:55.459 --> 00:03:59.870
 first highlight for allies 

00:03:57.320 --> 00:04:01.970
 all the enemies that are pushing here 

00:03:59.870 --> 00:04:04.880
 for allies who are on h1 

00:04:01.970 --> 00:04:06.860
 there is j1 and they will help you win + you 

00:04:04.880 --> 00:04:08.660
 can agrit enemies that will 

00:04:06.860 --> 00:04:10.850
 just shoot you well because you 

00:04:08.660 --> 00:04:12.860
 close here you shine but do not forget 

00:04:10.850 --> 00:04:15.019
 you need at least a tanx 

00:04:12.860 --> 00:04:17.450
 armored tower and better at all with 

00:04:15.019 --> 00:04:19.310
 fully felled like e 3 but it's just 

00:04:17.450 --> 00:04:21.859
 ideal because stand and 

00:04:19.310 --> 00:04:23.840
 go to the forest now and no point 

00:04:21.859 --> 00:04:25.669
 no there on on added hills and 

00:04:23.840 --> 00:04:27.919
 it turns out that lumbago 

00:04:25.669 --> 00:04:30.140
 practically no and you need exactly 

00:04:27.919 --> 00:04:31.790
 tank to highlight but do not forget 

00:04:30.140 --> 00:04:34.430
 Of course so that the arts were not there three 

00:04:31.790 --> 00:04:36.890
 four five pieces well 1 2 still can somehow 

00:04:34.430 --> 00:04:37.820
 you endure, in principle, you will be well 

00:04:36.890 --> 00:04:40.180
 coping here 

00:04:37.820 --> 00:04:43.060
 well now let's finally 

00:04:40.180 --> 00:04:45.700
 Fast forward to the forest in such a popular 

00:04:43.060 --> 00:04:48.340
 Murovanka where everything constantly and even nursery rhymes 

00:04:45.700 --> 00:04:50.200
 not only loved to masturbate right here all 

00:04:48.340 --> 00:04:52.810
 the battle there were such situations that everything is straight 

00:04:50.200 --> 00:04:55.780
 15 tanks liked to stand in this forest 

00:04:52.810 --> 00:04:58.060
 0s a little thinned here then added 

00:04:55.780 --> 00:04:59.770
 hills naturally indicate semi tunnel 

00:04:58.060 --> 00:05:02.889
 Nastya is still in the map 

00:04:59.770 --> 00:05:05.620
 nuruka new kartodelov always seen and 

00:05:02.889 --> 00:05:07.840
 we see that several houses were added and 

00:05:05.620 --> 00:05:09.760
 Overall here is now very very cool 

00:05:07.840 --> 00:05:11.590
 I will tell you not to be here now 

00:05:09.760 --> 00:05:13.990
 you can stand the whole battle here 

00:05:11.590 --> 00:05:16.450
 really arrange btr check hills 

00:05:13.990 --> 00:05:19.090
 first protect you from artillery 

00:05:16.450 --> 00:05:21.190
 although they are one hundred percent but you have 

00:05:19.090 --> 00:05:23.560
 will become much and much more difficult to get 

00:05:21.190 --> 00:05:25.930
 if you wag it at all I really 

00:05:23.560 --> 00:05:28.570
 and in general you can absolutely come here 

00:05:25.930 --> 00:05:31.210
 on any tank but the tank is best 

00:05:28.570 --> 00:05:33.370
 to have good tool declination angles 

00:05:31.210 --> 00:05:36.040
 to shoot and inflict damage on 

00:05:33.370 --> 00:05:37.900
 see enemies through these hills 

00:05:36.040 --> 00:05:40.000
 which is very comfortable you can yourself here 

00:05:37.900 --> 00:05:41.919
 feel by the example of t57 heavy con 

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:45.760
 not even look enough for him 

00:05:41.919 --> 00:05:48.280
 he has amazing corners and overall 

00:05:45.760 --> 00:05:49.750
 occupy positions here yourself if 

00:05:48.280 --> 00:05:52.600
 allies don't cover you here 

00:05:49.750 --> 00:05:54.580
 it's dangerous to go but if you are co-op 

00:05:52.600 --> 00:05:56.530
 can you two see either allies 

00:05:54.580 --> 00:05:58.750
 support you take this one 

00:05:56.530 --> 00:06:01.479
 a path between two hills to one 

00:05:58.750 --> 00:06:04.120
 covered your rear and keep it all 

00:06:01.479 --> 00:06:06.340
 direction and should you all succeed 

00:06:04.120 --> 00:06:08.200
 great the main thing is not to act like that 

00:06:06.340 --> 00:06:11.950
 he does not have this companion 

00:06:08.200 --> 00:06:14.410
 declinations and bring back t57 

00:06:11.950 --> 00:06:16.030
 him and he do nothing and do not 

00:06:14.410 --> 00:06:17.229
 maybe because he just 

00:06:16.030 --> 00:06:20.020
 quite lacking 

00:06:17.229 --> 00:06:21.669
 declination in general yes you can still 

00:06:20.020 --> 00:06:23.520
 talk about center someone plays from 

00:06:21.669 --> 00:06:25.770
 center but I'm reviewing there 

00:06:23.520 --> 00:06:27.930
 dozens of replays just by quantity 

00:06:25.770 --> 00:06:29.520
 Damage him some tactics precisely 

00:06:27.930 --> 00:06:31.740
 through the central city is not always 

00:06:29.520 --> 00:06:34.470
 rolls but you can try but i 

00:06:31.740 --> 00:06:36.449
 I personally do not recommend it to you and, in general, everything 

00:06:34.470 --> 00:06:38.940
 clear everything is clear map enough 

00:06:36.449 --> 00:06:40.259
 successfully, I got this all thanks 

00:06:38.940 --> 00:06:42.419
