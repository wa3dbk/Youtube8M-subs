this called Green Point and pretty much
isolates<00:02:18.959> the<00:02:19.170> green<00:02:19.470> and<00:02:20.780> but<00:02:21.780> makes

everything<00:02:22.560> else<00:02:22.769> black<00:02:23.069> and<00:02:23.250> white<00:02:23.430> so<00:02:24.239> those

00:02:24.380 --> 00:02:24.390 
everything else black and white so those

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:28.820 
everything else black and white so those
patches<00:02:24.690> now<00:02:25.019> normally<00:02:25.799> yellow<00:02:27.500> the<00:02:28.500> trees

00:02:28.820 --> 00:02:28.830 
patches now normally yellow the trees

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:30.680 
patches now normally yellow the trees
are<00:02:29.250> supposed<00:02:29.819> to<00:02:29.880> be<00:02:30.000> green<00:02:30.180> but<00:02:30.239> I<00:02:30.420> think<00:02:30.599> it

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:30.690 
are supposed to be green but I think it

00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:32.030 
are supposed to be green but I think it
had<00:02:30.810> the<00:02:30.840> trees<00:02:31.140> have<00:02:31.290> more<00:02:31.500> yellow<00:02:31.739> and

00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:32.040 
had the trees have more yellow and

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:34.699 
had the trees have more yellow and
orange<00:02:32.459> in<00:02:32.760> than<00:02:32.880> anything<00:02:33.510> at<00:02:34.349> the<00:02:34.470> top<00:02:34.650> so

00:02:34.699 --> 00:02:34.709 
orange in than anything at the top so

00:02:34.709 --> 00:02:38.300 
orange in than anything at the top so
green<00:02:35.220> and<00:02:36.319> the<00:02:37.319> grass<00:02:37.560> over<00:02:37.860> there<00:02:37.890> is<00:02:38.099> going

00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:38.310 
green and the grass over there is going

00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:40.250 
green and the grass over there is going
to<00:02:38.430> see<00:02:38.579> the<00:02:38.700> green<00:02:38.940> converter<00:02:39.510> over<00:02:40.079> there

00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:40.260 
to see the green converter over there

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:43.610 
to see the green converter over there
the<00:02:40.590> big<00:02:40.769> power<00:02:41.280> unit<00:02:42.049> that's<00:02:43.049> a<00:02:43.170> no<00:02:43.260> this<00:02:43.410> was

00:02:43.610 --> 00:02:43.620 
the big power unit that's a no this was

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:45.170 
the big power unit that's a no this was
called<00:02:43.860> Blue<00:02:44.130> Point<00:02:44.370> it<00:02:44.610> has<00:02:44.700> the<00:02:44.819> same<00:02:45.000> thing

00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:45.180 
called Blue Point it has the same thing

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:46.699 
called Blue Point it has the same thing
as<00:02:45.269> a<00:02:45.360> green<00:02:45.540> point<00:02:45.840> but<00:02:46.019> it<00:02:46.110> isolates<00:02:46.560> the

00:02:46.699 --> 00:02:46.709 
as a green point but it isolates the

00:02:46.709 --> 00:02:48.259 
as a green point but it isolates the
blue<00:02:46.950> so<00:02:47.370> as<00:02:47.459> you<00:02:47.549> can<00:02:47.700> see<00:02:47.849> everything<00:02:48.120> else

00:02:48.259 --> 00:02:48.269 
blue so as you can see everything else

00:02:48.269 --> 00:02:49.809 
blue so as you can see everything else
is<00:02:48.360> black<00:02:48.569> and<00:02:48.720> white<00:02:48.870> but<00:02:49.019> the<00:02:49.140> sky<00:02:49.410> is<00:02:49.470> blue

00:02:49.809 --> 00:02:49.819 
is black and white but the sky is blue

00:02:49.819 --> 00:02:52.059 
is black and white but the sky is blue
but<00:02:50.819> everything<00:02:51.150> else<00:02:51.269> is<00:02:51.420> black<00:02:51.690> and<00:02:51.870> white

00:02:52.059 --> 00:02:52.069 
but everything else is black and white

00:02:52.069 --> 00:02:55.490 
but everything else is black and white

00:03:14.870 --> 00:03:14.880 
the sky right here well you'll see that

00:03:14.880 --> 00:03:17.599 
the sky right here well you'll see that
still<00:03:15.319> let's<00:03:16.319> go<00:03:16.440> to<00:03:16.590> these<00:03:16.859> red<00:03:17.370> and<00:03:17.489> yellow

00:03:17.609 --> 00:03:19.400 
still let's go to these red and yellow
point<00:03:17.940> so<00:03:18.090> only<00:03:18.299> isolate<00:03:18.720> the<00:03:18.870> Reds<00:03:19.079> in<00:03:19.230> the

00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:19.410 
point so only isolate the Reds in the

00:03:19.410 --> 00:03:22.340 
point so only isolate the Reds in the
yellows<00:03:19.709> in<00:03:19.739> the<00:03:20.010> photo<00:03:20.940> like<00:03:21.810> I<00:03:21.959> said<00:03:22.139> the

00:03:22.340 --> 00:03:22.350 
yellows in the photo like I said the

00:03:22.350 --> 00:03:24.289 
yellows in the photo like I said the
trees<00:03:22.620> have<00:03:22.889> a<00:03:22.920> lot<00:03:23.100> of<00:03:23.130> yellow<00:03:23.400> in<00:03:23.489> them<00:03:23.760> so

00:03:24.289 --> 00:03:24.299 
trees have a lot of yellow in them so

00:03:24.299 --> 00:03:26.420 
trees have a lot of yellow in them so
it's<00:03:24.870> highlighting<00:03:25.500> the<00:03:25.590> yellow<00:03:25.799> along<00:03:26.220> with

00:03:26.420 --> 00:03:26.430 
it's highlighting the yellow along with

00:03:26.430 --> 00:03:28.580 
it's highlighting the yellow along with
the<00:03:26.549> green<00:03:26.790> next<00:03:27.120> to<00:03:27.239> that<00:03:27.389> as<00:03:28.139> you<00:03:28.290> can<00:03:28.350> see

00:03:54.650 --> 00:03:54.660 
let's go ahead and get to the nexus s

00:03:54.660 --> 00:03:57.110 
let's go ahead and get to the nexus s
call<00:03:54.959> or<00:03:55.290> two<00:03:55.530> to<00:03:55.650> phi<00:03:55.859> so<00:03:56.819> it<00:03:56.940> makes

00:03:57.110 --> 00:03:57.120 
call or two to phi so it makes

00:03:57.120 --> 00:03:59.900 
call or two to phi so it makes
everything<00:03:57.389> look<00:03:57.630> pretty<00:03:58.139> cartoony<00:03:58.950> you<00:03:59.730> can

here looks pretty hard Tony does it

00:04:07.060 --> 00:04:11.890 
here looks pretty hard Tony does it
that's<00:04:08.060> cartoon<00:04:08.569> if<00:04:08.690> I<00:04:10.599> see<00:04:11.599> that<00:04:11.629> it<00:04:11.870> looks

00:04:11.890 --> 00:04:11.900 
that's cartoon if I see that it looks

00:04:11.900 --> 00:04:14.229 
that's cartoon if I see that it looks
pretty<00:04:12.230> cartoony<00:04:13.060> everything<00:04:14.060> looks

00:04:14.229 --> 00:04:14.239 
pretty cartoony everything looks

00:04:14.239 --> 00:04:17.620 
pretty cartoony everything looks
cartoony<00:04:15.220> that's<00:04:16.220> pretty<00:04:16.459> cool<00:04:16.609> another<00:04:17.359> full

00:04:17.620 --> 00:04:17.630 
cartoony that's pretty cool another full

00:04:17.630 --> 00:04:20.050 
cartoony that's pretty cool another full
effect<00:04:17.930> this<00:04:18.680> one<00:04:18.979> gets<00:04:19.190> in<00:04:19.340> this<00:04:19.609> one<00:04:19.790> is<00:04:19.910> your

00:04:20.050 --> 00:04:20.060 
effect this one gets in this one is your

00:04:20.060 --> 00:04:23.680 
effect this one gets in this one is your
traditional<00:04:20.209> black<00:04:20.810> and<00:04:21.019> white<00:04:21.430> so<00:04:22.510> not<00:04:23.510> much

00:04:23.680 --> 00:04:23.690 
traditional black and white so not much

00:04:23.690 --> 00:04:25.810 
traditional black and white so not much
there<00:04:23.990> it<00:04:24.590> has<00:04:24.740> pretty<00:04:24.919> good<00:04:25.100> contrast<00:04:25.610> don't

00:04:25.810 --> 00:04:25.820 
there it has pretty good contrast don't

00:04:25.820 --> 00:04:28.689
