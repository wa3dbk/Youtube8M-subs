00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.870
 hello to all so today we're going 

00:00:01.920 --> 00:00:07.670
 do a little review so it's 

00:00:03.870 --> 00:00:10.260
 the safety equipment must be 

00:00:07.670 --> 00:00:12.540
 two eye protection glasses 

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:14.490
 the mark boli these are the beautiful ones 

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:16.590
 outlines I took the smoke colors 

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:19.039
 that I play in an environment that 

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:21.960
 is often sunny plays outdoors 

00:00:19.039 --> 00:00:24.630
 so I paid 15 euros so that's 

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:26.010
 really cheap and it's very very 

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:27.240
 very good quality 

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:32.150
 gazelle to phoenix and stand out I 

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:32.150
 would fit well in the description and e 

00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:38.100
 -e 

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:41.730
 so here is in the packaging there is 

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:44.250
 a manual that have all the 

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:47.270
 languages ​​so in France and that's it at each 

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:47.270
 times it's all the languages ​​that there are 

00:00:50.059 --> 00:00:58.680
 spanish in buli small i do not know this 

00:00:53.940 --> 00:01:02.460
 that it is ferland 10 francs if we see 

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:11.549
 apparently hilton 

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:14.490
 yes but here is it you took 18 times 

00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:17.670
 two languages ​​so it's pretty cool 

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:19.250
 it's quite interesting so what is it 

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:25.920
 that there is in this manual 

00:01:19.250 --> 00:01:27.390
 they say they have thrashed the case codes 

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:30.810
 on mounts and on winter what's 

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:34.310
 it fits so I'll come back 

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:38.880
 on that took us the manual 

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:40.540
 that's moisture protection to no 

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:44.060
 not eat 

00:01:40.540 --> 00:01:45.250
 behind we have characteristics so 

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:48.380
 anti-scratch and anti-fog treatment 

00:01:45.250 --> 00:01:51.620
 certified nor rent it smooth and branches 

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:55.490
 when they say that's it after he's 

00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:57.170
 little message in English about soldier who 

00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:59.860
 say that bull is a brand that is 

00:01:57.170 --> 00:02:06.230
 care about your safety 

00:01:59.860 --> 00:02:09.380
 so here's nothing to say about it 

00:02:06.230 --> 00:02:11.750
 of special ja here are markings of which 

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:14.050
 I will come back after the marking 

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:21.340
 wanted to translate 

00:02:14.050 --> 00:02:23.690
 so there are 5-2 and a half ftk n 

00:02:21.340 --> 00:02:25.550
 so that's not slowed down it's 

00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:33.160
 which interests us is so when we 

00:02:25.550 --> 00:02:37.130
 translated he indulges them so ffb has 

00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:40.330
 then we have the f and the tfc impact of 

00:02:37.130 --> 00:02:48.440
 low energy 45 meters second was 

00:02:40.330 --> 00:02:49.940
 corresponds to it's the impacts of great 

00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:51.860
 velocity at high speed and the 

00:02:49.940 --> 00:02:55.870
 extreme temperatures see this for the 

00:02:51.860 --> 00:02:55.870
 breeding use case it's important 

00:02:55.900 --> 00:03:04.850
 then we have a protective bag is 

00:03:01.820 --> 00:03:06.050
 in itself it's nice with written ball and 

00:03:04.850 --> 00:03:08.150
 esteem so it's good enough for 

00:03:06.050 --> 00:03:11.170
 protect the minettes and of course we have 

00:03:08.150 --> 00:03:11.170
 glasses 

00:03:11.650 --> 00:03:16.820
 so that's where the gru and the 

00:03:15.380 --> 00:03:19.610
 benefits of these glasses 

00:03:16.820 --> 00:03:20.780
 it's the weight they are barely 23 g 

00:03:19.610 --> 00:03:23.300
 our they really are really 

00:03:20.780 --> 00:03:25.490
 really light 

00:03:23.300 --> 00:03:29.090
 are smoked they are eighteen are 

00:03:25.490 --> 00:03:33.260
 available in several colors 

00:03:29.090 --> 00:03:35.000
 how colorless in yellow and another 

00:03:33.260 --> 00:03:37.940
 color that I actually included it 

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:40.190
 is there a system of reflections on and when 

00:03:37.940 --> 00:03:42.560
 we look it's a little yellow young 

00:03:40.190 --> 00:03:46.010
 smoke if it's rather it's pretty good 

00:03:42.560 --> 00:03:47.530
 so here are mounts also rung 

00:03:46.010 --> 00:03:50.330
 swing in several colors 

00:03:47.530 --> 00:03:53.000
 so that's like said treatment 

00:03:50.330 --> 00:03:54.350
 anti-scratch and anti-fog nose and anti 

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:55.010
 slip so it's rubber and that 

00:03:54.350 --> 00:03:56.900
 it's pretty good 

00:03:55.010 --> 00:03:58.700
 we can see that it takes good shape 

00:03:56.900 --> 00:04:01.460
 from the head the branches to the extremities 

00:03:58.700 --> 00:04:04.730
 are flexible and rubber for not 

00:04:01.460 --> 00:04:05.930
 to skid and so that's the weight 

00:04:04.730 --> 00:04:07.730
 can not be too clean it can not be too 

00:04:05.930 --> 00:04:10.820
 slide in addition this is the system of 

00:04:07.730 --> 00:04:14.390
 retention in the back but hey it's 

00:04:10.820 --> 00:04:15.890
 always better to have a small 

00:04:14.390 --> 00:04:16.910
 cord behind that keeps in glasses 

00:04:15.890 --> 00:04:20.060
 at least it's him to lose them 

00:04:16.910 --> 00:04:24.350
 I do not know for sure we did what we did 

00:04:20.060 --> 00:04:27.440
 can say about that there we have a 

00:04:24.350 --> 00:04:28.820
 little con tour from where the name of the 

00:04:27.440 --> 00:04:32.330
 product so beautiful the outlines is that 

00:04:28.820 --> 00:04:35.780
 it protects behind the eyes the place 

00:04:32.330 --> 00:04:37.040
 where there are the most holes there is there 

00:04:35.780 --> 00:04:40.730
 after that depends on the morphology of the 

00:04:37.040 --> 00:04:44.690
 no one here so it was there reviews 

00:04:40.730 --> 00:04:46.820
 and leases the outlines in color 

00:04:44.690 --> 00:04:50.210
 smoke that I bought for 15 euros so 

00:04:46.820 --> 00:04:51.620
 that they receive so here is especially very 

00:04:50.210 --> 00:04:53.330
 very important in the equipment these 

00:04:51.620 --> 00:04:57.110
 same even more important than the 

00:04:53.330 --> 00:04:58.820
 replicate his glasses so especially to 

00:04:57.110 --> 00:05:00.950
 protect yourself because a ball in 

00:04:58.820 --> 00:05:03.410
 the eyes do not forgive and it's beautiful 

00:05:00.950 --> 00:05:05.210
 very dangerous so that does not appear 

00:05:03.410 --> 00:05:07.100
 however it helped you if you 

00:05:05.210 --> 00:05:08.860
 do you have questions wholesale do not hesitate 

00:05:07.100 --> 00:05:11.480
 not to ask me 

00:05:08.860 --> 00:05:12.919
 frankly it's worth it it's not 

00:05:11.480 --> 00:05:13.460
 dear and that's the very very very very 

00:05:12.919 --> 00:05:15.860
 good quality 

00:05:13.460 --> 00:05:17.360
 so here's thanks for watching the video 

00:05:15.860 --> 00:05:20.080
 insurance and you liked it and see you soon 

00:05:17.360 --> 00:05:20.080
 for a new region
