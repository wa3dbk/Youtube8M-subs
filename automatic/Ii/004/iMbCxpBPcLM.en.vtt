hello Garrett ace 250 and ace 150 fans

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:13.230 
hello Garrett ace 250 and ace 150 fans
Garrett's<00:00:10.480> made<00:00:10.660> a<00:00:10.690> nice<00:00:10.960> detector<00:00:11.530> here<00:00:12.240> it

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:13.240 
Garrett's made a nice detector here it

00:00:13.240 --> 00:00:14.970 
Garrett's made a nice detector here it
fell<00:00:13.600> a<00:00:13.629> little<00:00:13.809> short<00:00:13.930> on<00:00:14.260> organ<00:00:14.650> ah<00:00:14.769> mcc's

00:00:14.970 --> 00:00:14.980 
fell a little short on organ ah mcc's

00:00:14.980 --> 00:00:16.620 
fell a little short on organ ah mcc's
for<00:00:15.190> most<00:00:15.340> people

00:00:16.620 --> 00:00:16.630 
for most people

00:00:16.630 --> 00:00:19.679 
for most people
one<00:00:17.230> is<00:00:17.470> the<00:00:17.860> arm<00:00:18.070> cup<00:00:18.340> is<00:00:18.520> too<00:00:18.550> short<00:00:19.000> which

00:00:19.679 --> 00:00:19.689 
one is the arm cup is too short which

00:00:19.689 --> 00:00:22.380 
one is the arm cup is too short which
rides<00:00:20.050> in<00:00:20.320> the<00:00:20.439> center<00:00:20.740> of<00:00:20.920> your<00:00:21.040> forearm<00:00:21.390> like

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:22.390 
rides in the center of your forearm like

00:00:22.390 --> 00:00:26.960 
rides in the center of your forearm like
so<00:00:22.720> this<00:00:23.560> arm<00:00:23.860> cuff<00:00:24.130> should<00:00:24.369> be<00:00:24.520> back<00:00:24.730> here<00:00:25.619> so

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:26.970 
so this arm cuff should be back here so

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:29.940 
so this arm cuff should be back here so
it<00:00:27.970> fits<00:00:28.270> in<00:00:28.450> the<00:00:28.540> larger<00:00:29.079> part<00:00:29.349> of<00:00:29.439> your<00:00:29.590> arm

00:00:29.940 --> 00:00:29.950 
it fits in the larger part of your arm

00:00:29.950 --> 00:00:32.370 
it fits in the larger part of your arm
plus<00:00:30.399> there's<00:00:30.700> less<00:00:30.939> torque<00:00:31.329> when<00:00:32.230> you're

00:00:32.370 --> 00:00:32.380 
plus there's less torque when you're

00:00:32.380 --> 00:00:34.229 
plus there's less torque when you're
swinging<00:00:32.619> the<00:00:32.770> detector<00:00:33.309> the<00:00:33.640> second<00:00:34.059> thing

00:00:34.229 --> 00:00:34.239 
swinging the detector the second thing

00:00:34.239 --> 00:00:36.810 
swinging the detector the second thing
is<00:00:34.480> that<00:00:34.690> it's<00:00:35.230> coil<00:00:35.530> heavy<00:00:35.829> so<00:00:36.489> it<00:00:36.640> always

00:00:36.810 --> 00:00:36.820 
is that it's coil heavy so it always

00:00:36.820 --> 00:00:38.460 
is that it's coil heavy so it always
feels<00:00:37.210> a<00:00:37.360> little<00:00:37.480> nose-heavy<00:00:38.080> when<00:00:38.350> you're

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:38.470 
feels a little nose-heavy when you're

00:00:38.470 --> 00:00:41.010 
feels a little nose-heavy when you're
swinging<00:00:38.740> so<00:00:39.640> I<00:00:39.880> came<00:00:40.240> up<00:00:40.420> with<00:00:40.630> a<00:00:40.660> solution

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:41.020 
swinging so I came up with a solution

00:00:41.020 --> 00:00:42.450 
swinging so I came up with a solution
for<00:00:41.380> both<00:00:41.500> of<00:00:41.710> those<00:00:41.770> problems

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:42.460 
for both of those problems

00:00:42.460 --> 00:00:45.450 
for both of those problems
it's<00:00:43.180> the<00:00:43.390> Garrett<00:00:43.630> gizmo<00:00:44.080> it's<00:00:44.770> a<00:00:44.920> piece<00:00:45.190> of

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:45.460 
it's the Garrett gizmo it's a piece of

00:00:45.460 --> 00:00:49.410 
it's the Garrett gizmo it's a piece of
solid<00:00:45.790> aluminum<00:00:46.980> cnc'd<00:00:47.980> machine<00:00:48.430> and<00:00:48.730> what

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:49.420 
solid aluminum cnc'd machine and what

00:00:49.420 --> 00:00:53.069 
solid aluminum cnc'd machine and what
this<00:00:49.570> does<00:00:49.870> is<00:00:50.400> will<00:00:51.400> extend<00:00:51.910> the<00:00:52.600> factory

00:00:53.069 --> 00:00:53.079 
this does is will extend the factory

00:00:53.079 --> 00:00:56.370 
this does is will extend the factory

setting of the arm cuff back here where
it<00:00:56.470> needs<00:00:56.650> to<00:00:56.860> be<00:00:57.010> for<00:00:57.280> most<00:00:57.430> people<00:00:57.880> and<00:00:59.250> I'll

00:01:00.240 --> 00:01:00.250 
it needs to be for most people and I'll

00:01:00.250 --> 00:01:02.670 
it needs to be for most people and I'll
show<00:01:00.520> you<00:01:00.579> how<00:01:00.760> easy<00:01:01.030> it<00:01:01.239> is<00:01:01.300> to<00:01:01.450> put<00:01:01.630> on<00:01:01.780> flip

00:01:41.160 --> 00:01:41.170 

00:01:41.170 --> 00:01:44.709 

it's<00:01:42.170> installed<00:01:42.820> that's<00:01:43.820> all<00:01:44.060> there<00:01:44.240> is<00:01:44.359> to<00:01:44.600> it

00:01:44.709 --> 00:01:44.719 
it's installed that's all there is to it

00:01:44.719 --> 00:01:47.919 
it's installed that's all there is to it
we've<00:01:45.530> now<00:01:45.710> extended<00:01:46.009> the<00:01:46.789> factory<00:01:47.270> arm<00:01:47.570> cup

00:01:47.919 --> 00:01:47.929 
we've now extended the factory arm cup

00:01:47.929 --> 00:01:51.399 
we've now extended the factory arm cup
adjustments<00:01:48.579> back<00:01:49.579> here<00:01:50.000> which<00:01:50.960> adds<00:01:51.170> an

00:01:51.399 --> 00:01:51.409 
adjustments back here which adds an

00:01:51.409 --> 00:01:54.149 
adjustments back here which adds an
extra<00:01:51.649> four<00:01:52.189> inches<00:01:52.579> at<00:01:53.179> its<00:01:53.240> maximum

00:01:54.149 --> 00:01:54.159 
extra four inches at its maximum

00:01:54.159 --> 00:01:57.730 
extra four inches at its maximum
adjustment<00:01:55.159> and<00:01:55.280> then<00:01:55.819> each<00:01:56.740> adjustment

00:01:57.730 --> 00:01:57.740 
adjustment and then each adjustment

00:01:57.740 --> 00:02:03.340 
adjustment and then each adjustment
closer<00:01:58.369> is<00:01:58.729> one-inch<00:02:00.490> so<00:02:01.490> you<00:02:02.209> take<00:02:02.420> your<00:02:02.450> arm

00:02:03.340 --> 00:02:03.350 
closer is one-inch so you take your arm

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:06.789 
closer is one-inch so you take your arm
cuff<00:02:03.649> and<00:02:04.090> I<00:02:05.090> suggest<00:02:05.630> just<00:02:05.750> putting<00:02:06.590> it<00:02:06.709> in

00:02:06.789 --> 00:02:06.799 
cuff and I suggest just putting it in

00:02:06.799 --> 00:02:09.460 
cuff and I suggest just putting it in
the<00:02:06.920> middle<00:02:07.250> position<00:02:08.019> flipping<00:02:09.019> the<00:02:09.140> machine

00:02:09.460 --> 00:02:09.470 
the middle position flipping the machine

00:02:09.470 --> 00:02:12.940 
the middle position flipping the machine
over<00:02:09.679> and<00:02:10.039> put<00:02:10.970> your<00:02:11.090> arm<00:02:11.330> in<00:02:11.540> if<00:02:12.319> it<00:02:12.500> fits<00:02:12.709> back

00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:12.950 
over and put your arm in if it fits back

00:02:12.950 --> 00:02:14.650 
over and put your arm in if it fits back
close<00:02:13.220> your<00:02:13.400> elbow<00:02:13.730> and<00:02:13.880> feels<00:02:14.090> good<00:02:14.360> that's

00:02:14.650 --> 00:02:14.660 
close your elbow and feels good that's

00:02:14.660 --> 00:02:21.970 
close your elbow and feels good that's
good<00:02:15.019> you<00:02:15.920> can<00:02:16.099> put<00:02:16.310> it<00:02:16.610> anywhere<00:02:16.700> you<00:02:17.000> want<00:02:20.980> at

00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:21.980 
good you can put it anywhere you want at

00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:26.319 
good you can put it anywhere you want at
the<00:02:22.160> end<00:02:23.349> or<00:02:24.349> at<00:02:24.470> the<00:02:24.500> very<00:02:24.620> shortest<00:02:25.329> this

00:02:26.319 --> 00:02:26.329 
the end or at the very shortest this

00:02:26.329 --> 00:02:28.600 
the end or at the very shortest this
brings<00:02:26.630> up<00:02:26.810> another<00:02:26.959> point<00:02:27.380> what<00:02:28.010> we<00:02:28.130> did<00:02:28.310> with

00:02:28.600 --> 00:02:28.610 
brings up another point what we did with

00:02:28.610 --> 00:02:32.440 
brings up another point what we did with
the<00:02:29.110> gizmo<00:02:30.110> is<00:02:30.319> we<00:02:30.650> put<00:02:31.090> champers<00:02:32.090> grooves

00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:32.450 
the gizmo is we put champers grooves

00:02:32.450 --> 00:02:34.870 
the gizmo is we put champers grooves
here<00:02:32.959> and<00:02:33.200> what<00:02:33.709> that's<00:02:33.920> for<00:02:34.190> is<00:02:34.430> you<00:02:34.700> don't

00:02:34.870 --> 00:02:34.880 
here and what that's for is you don't

00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:36.910 
here and what that's for is you don't
like<00:02:35.000> the<00:02:35.209> extra<00:02:35.540> material<00:02:36.019> sticking<00:02:36.349> out<00:02:36.500> you

00:02:36.910 --> 00:02:36.920 
like the extra material sticking out you

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:38.860 
like the extra material sticking out you
can<00:02:37.040> cut<00:02:37.250> that<00:02:37.370> off<00:02:37.549> with<00:02:37.730> a<00:02:37.760> hacksaw<00:02:38.030> you

00:02:38.860 --> 00:02:38.870 
can cut that off with a hacksaw you

00:02:38.870 --> 00:02:40.660 
can cut that off with a hacksaw you
would<00:02:38.989> put<00:02:39.140> your<00:02:39.230> hacksaw<00:02:39.650> in<00:02:39.920> and<00:02:40.160> cut<00:02:40.549> around

00:02:40.660 --> 00:02:40.670 
would put your hacksaw in and cut around

00:02:40.670 --> 00:02:43.449 
would put your hacksaw in and cut around
until<00:02:41.329> your<00:02:41.480> material<00:02:41.930> is<00:02:42.079> cut<00:02:42.410> off<00:02:42.590> then<00:02:43.430> that

00:02:43.449 --> 00:02:43.459 
until your material is cut off then that

00:02:43.459 --> 00:02:46.449 
until your material is cut off then that
leaves<00:02:43.849> a<00:02:44.030> nice<00:02:44.350> shampooed<00:02:45.350> machined<00:02:45.799> edge<00:02:46.160> on

00:02:50.349 --> 00:02:50.359 
the edge here not a sharp flat cut so

00:02:50.359 --> 00:02:53.400 
the edge here not a sharp flat cut so
you<00:02:50.720> have<00:02:50.930> it<00:02:51.079> on<00:02:51.280> the<00:02:52.280> shortest<00:02:52.639> position

00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:53.410 
you have it on the shortest position

00:02:53.410 --> 00:02:57.580 
you have it on the shortest position
there's<00:02:54.410> the<00:02:54.859> shampoo<00:02:56.019> if<00:02:57.019> you<00:02:57.200> have<00:02:57.350> it<00:02:57.470> in

00:02:57.580 --> 00:02:57.590 
there's the shampoo if you have it in

00:02:57.590 --> 00:02:59.920 
there's the shampoo if you have it in
the<00:02:57.650> medium<00:02:58.010> position<00:02:58.459> a<00:02:58.609> chamfer<00:02:58.940> of<00:02:59.329> course

in<00:03:00.139> the<00:03:00.230> end<00:03:00.380> position<00:03:00.950> you<00:03:01.400> wouldn't<00:03:01.700> need<00:03:01.819> to

00:03:01.870 --> 00:03:01.880 
in the end position you wouldn't need to

00:03:01.880 --> 00:03:04.479 
in the end position you wouldn't need to
cut<00:03:02.209> it<00:03:02.359> in<00:03:02.510> fact<00:03:03.170> you<00:03:03.739> wouldn't<00:03:03.980> need<00:03:04.190> to<00:03:04.220> cut

00:03:04.479 --> 00:03:04.489 
cut it in fact you wouldn't need to cut

00:03:04.489 --> 00:03:06.759 
cut it in fact you wouldn't need to cut
it<00:03:04.609> anyway<00:03:04.850> unless<00:03:05.510> you<00:03:05.720> don't<00:03:05.930> like<00:03:06.109> the

00:03:06.759 --> 00:03:06.769 
it anyway unless you don't like the

00:03:06.769 --> 00:03:08.830 
it anyway unless you don't like the
extra<00:03:06.859> material<00:03:07.430> sticking<00:03:07.790> out<00:03:07.970> but<00:03:08.540> we<00:03:08.660> made

00:03:08.830 --> 00:03:08.840 
extra material sticking out but we made

00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:13.300 
extra material sticking out but we made
a<00:03:08.870> provision<00:03:09.079> for<00:03:09.530> that<00:03:09.560> if<00:03:10.069> you<00:03:10.310> do<00:03:10.510> so<00:03:12.310> flip

00:03:13.300 --> 00:03:13.310 
a provision for that if you do so flip

00:03:13.310 --> 00:03:20.650 
a provision for that if you do so flip
it<00:03:13.430> back<00:03:13.609> over<00:03:18.160> retighten<00:03:19.160> the<00:03:19.310> nut<00:03:19.940> or<00:03:20.329> the

00:03:20.650 --> 00:03:20.660 
it back over retighten the nut or the

00:03:20.660 --> 00:03:24.560 
it back over retighten the nut or the
screw

00:03:24.560 --> 00:03:24.570 

00:03:24.570 --> 00:03:30.300 

and<00:03:25.570> there<00:03:26.380> you<00:03:26.470> have<00:03:26.530> it<00:03:26.830> now<00:03:28.170> it<00:03:29.170> fits<00:03:29.500> in<00:03:29.710> the

00:03:30.300 --> 00:03:30.310 
and there you have it now it fits in the

00:03:30.310 --> 00:03:33.330 
and there you have it now it fits in the
big<00:03:30.490> part<00:03:30.760> of<00:03:30.790> my<00:03:30.910> forearm<00:03:32.070> so<00:03:33.070> when<00:03:33.250> I'm

00:03:33.330 --> 00:03:33.340 
big part of my forearm so when I'm

00:03:33.340 --> 00:03:36.060 
big part of my forearm so when I'm
swinging<00:03:33.670> it<00:03:33.910> it's<00:03:34.120> not<00:03:34.360> loose<00:03:34.690> the<00:03:35.500> second<00:03:35.920> is

00:03:36.060 --> 00:03:36.070 
swinging it it's not loose the second is

00:03:36.070 --> 00:03:39.690 
swinging it it's not loose the second is
we've<00:03:37.110> increased<00:03:38.110> the<00:03:38.710> leverage<00:03:39.130> here<00:03:39.430> so

00:03:39.690 --> 00:03:39.700 
we've increased the leverage here so

00:03:39.700 --> 00:03:42.210 
we've increased the leverage here so
there's<00:03:39.880> less<00:03:40.030> torque<00:03:40.420> on<00:03:40.570> my<00:03:40.660> arm<00:03:40.900> and<00:03:41.220> by

00:03:42.210 --> 00:03:42.220 
there's less torque on my arm and by

00:03:42.220 --> 00:03:45.150 
there's less torque on my arm and by
adding<00:03:42.490> the<00:03:42.760> 4.2<00:03:43.420> ounces<00:03:43.560> plus<00:03:44.560> moving<00:03:45.070> the

00:03:45.150 --> 00:03:45.160 
adding the 4.2 ounces plus moving the

00:03:45.160 --> 00:03:48.840 
adding the 4.2 ounces plus moving the
arm<00:03:45.370> cuff<00:03:45.640> weight<00:03:45.910> further<00:03:46.690> to<00:03:46.960> the<00:03:47.050> rear<00:03:47.850> it

00:03:48.840 --> 00:03:48.850 
arm cuff weight further to the rear it

00:03:48.850 --> 00:03:53.160 
arm cuff weight further to the rear it
takes<00:03:49.600> more<00:03:50.020> weight<00:03:50.320> off<00:03:50.560> the<00:03:51.040> coil<00:03:52.020> also<00:03:53.020> in

00:03:53.160 --> 00:03:53.170 
takes more weight off the coil also in

00:03:53.170 --> 00:03:55.800 
takes more weight off the coil also in
doing<00:03:53.530> this<00:03:53.710> it<00:03:53.980> shifts<00:03:54.640> the<00:03:54.670> center<00:03:55.570> of

00:03:55.800 --> 00:03:55.810 
doing this it shifts the center of

00:03:55.810 --> 00:03:59.100 
doing this it shifts the center of
balance<00:03:56.230> of<00:03:56.410> the<00:03:56.590> total<00:03:56.980> machine<00:03:57.690> back<00:03:58.690> closer

00:03:59.100 --> 00:03:59.110 
balance of the total machine back closer

00:03:59.110 --> 00:04:01.530 
balance of the total machine back closer
to<00:03:59.350> your<00:03:59.500> hand<00:03:59.860> a<00:04:00.070> full<00:04:00.580> three<00:04:00.910> inches<00:04:01.300> and

00:04:01.530 --> 00:04:01.540 
to your hand a full three inches and

00:04:01.540 --> 00:04:04.310 
to your hand a full three inches and
that's<00:04:02.230> what<00:04:02.530> the<00:04:02.740> the<00:04:03.250> nine<00:04:03.490> by<00:04:03.670> twelve<00:04:03.940> coil

00:04:04.310 --> 00:04:04.320 
that's what the the nine by twelve coil

00:04:04.320 --> 00:04:08.520 
that's what the the nine by twelve coil
so<00:04:05.320> all<00:04:05.980> that<00:04:06.400> combined<00:04:06.940> will<00:04:07.810> ease<00:04:08.230> your

00:04:08.520 --> 00:04:08.530 
so all that combined will ease your

00:04:08.530 --> 00:04:11.280 
so all that combined will ease your
fatigue<00:04:08.950> and<00:04:09.390> make<00:04:10.390> it<00:04:10.570> let<00:04:10.780> you<00:04:10.900> detect

00:04:11.280 --> 00:04:11.290 
fatigue and make it let you detect

00:04:11.290 --> 00:04:12.990 
fatigue and make it let you detect
longer<00:04:11.710> without<00:04:12.070> your<00:04:12.340> arm<00:04:12.490> getting<00:04:12.730> sore

00:04:12.990 --> 00:04:13.000 
longer without your arm getting sore

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:16.100 
longer without your arm getting sore
your<00:04:13.300> shoulder<00:04:13.600> getting<00:04:13.810> sore<00:04:14.020> so<00:04:14.980> anyway

00:04:16.100 --> 00:04:16.110
