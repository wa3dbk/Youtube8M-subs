00:00:13.060 --> 00:00:13.070 
well my experience in clearing it was

00:00:13.070 --> 00:00:15.640 
well my experience in clearing it was
around<00:00:13.450> September<00:00:14.450> time<00:00:14.630> I<00:00:14.900> was<00:00:15.290> kind<00:00:15.500> of

00:00:15.640 --> 00:00:15.650 
around September time I was kind of

00:00:15.650 --> 00:00:17.439 
around September time I was kind of
wondering<00:00:16.099> whether<00:00:16.550> I<00:00:16.609> wanted<00:00:16.999> to<00:00:17.060> go<00:00:17.390> to

wondering whether I wanted to go to
university<00:00:17.720> or<00:00:18.710> leave<00:00:19.249> and<00:00:19.519> kind<00:00:19.730> of<00:00:19.820> get<00:00:19.970> a

university or leave and kind of get a

00:00:19.999 --> 00:00:22.450 
university or leave and kind of get a
job<00:00:20.300> I<00:00:20.630> wasn't<00:00:20.929> too<00:00:21.140> sure<00:00:21.169> about<00:00:21.380> my<00:00:21.710> options<00:00:22.189> I

00:00:22.450 --> 00:00:22.460 
job I wasn't too sure about my options I

00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:24.069 
job I wasn't too sure about my options I
was<00:00:22.789> a<00:00:22.820> short<00:00:23.089> from<00:00:23.210> University<00:00:23.599> was<00:00:23.749> for<00:00:23.929> me

00:00:24.069 --> 00:00:24.079 
was a short from University was for me

00:00:24.079 --> 00:00:26.979 
was a short from University was for me
but<00:00:24.769> in<00:00:24.859> the<00:00:24.890> end<00:00:25.130> I<00:00:25.369> was<00:00:26.269> watching<00:00:26.569> news<00:00:26.779> and<00:00:26.960> I

00:00:26.979 --> 00:00:26.989 
but in the end I was watching news and I

00:00:26.989 --> 00:00:30.370 
but in the end I was watching news and I
actually<00:00:27.199> and<00:00:27.710> Pearson<00:00:28.519> came<00:00:28.699> up<00:00:28.849> and<00:00:29.079> I<00:00:30.079> found

00:00:30.370 --> 00:00:30.380 
actually and Pearson came up and I found

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:32.440 
actually and Pearson came up and I found
out<00:00:30.589> it<00:00:30.769> was<00:00:30.859> an<00:00:30.949> amazing<00:00:31.339> experience<00:00:31.939> so<00:00:32.029> I

00:00:32.440 --> 00:00:32.450 
out it was an amazing experience so I

00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:34.299 
out it was an amazing experience so I
didn't<00:00:33.140> think<00:00:33.289> much<00:00:33.440> of<00:00:33.500> it<00:00:33.710> at<00:00:33.800> first<00:00:34.070> I

00:00:34.299 --> 00:00:34.309 
didn't think much of it at first I

00:00:34.309 --> 00:00:35.740 
didn't think much of it at first I
thought<00:00:34.430> maybe<00:00:34.640> it's<00:00:34.820> a<00:00:34.850> bit<00:00:34.969> far-fetched<00:00:35.180> I

00:00:35.740 --> 00:00:35.750 
thought maybe it's a bit far-fetched I

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:37.689 
thought maybe it's a bit far-fetched I
think<00:00:35.960> maybe<00:00:36.140> the<00:00:36.800> requirements<00:00:37.370> I<00:00:37.430> may<00:00:37.550> not

00:00:37.689 --> 00:00:37.699 
think maybe the requirements I may not

00:00:37.699 --> 00:00:40.479 
think maybe the requirements I may not
get<00:00:37.940> it<00:00:38.090> but<00:00:38.120> I<00:00:38.750> thought<00:00:39.320> I'll<00:00:39.469> take<00:00:40.160> the<00:00:40.340> pun

00:00:40.479 --> 00:00:40.489 
get it but I thought I'll take the pun

00:00:40.489 --> 00:00:42.849 
get it but I thought I'll take the pun
and<00:00:40.670> I<00:00:40.730> went<00:00:40.940> for<00:00:41.239> the<00:00:42.109> interview<00:00:42.230> I<00:00:42.530> applied

00:00:42.849 --> 00:00:42.859 
and I went for the interview I applied

00:00:42.859 --> 00:00:46.329 
and I went for the interview I applied
and<00:00:44.079> it'll<00:00:45.079> work<00:00:45.260> that<00:00:45.469> amazingly<00:00:45.980> it<00:00:46.219> was

00:00:46.329 --> 00:00:46.339 
and it'll work that amazingly it was

00:00:46.339 --> 00:00:47.919 
and it'll work that amazingly it was
probably<00:00:46.820> the<00:00:46.910> best<00:00:47.089> decision<00:00:47.269> of<00:00:47.570> my<00:00:47.690> life

00:00:47.919 --> 00:00:47.929 
probably the best decision of my life

00:00:47.929 --> 00:00:49.689 
probably the best decision of my life
clearing<00:00:48.469> kind<00:00:48.829> of<00:00:48.920> gave<00:00:49.039> me<00:00:49.160> a<00:00:49.219> clear<00:00:49.460> head

00:00:49.689 --> 00:00:49.699 
clearing kind of gave me a clear head

00:00:49.699 --> 00:00:52.540 
clearing kind of gave me a clear head
and<00:00:50.079> really<00:00:51.079> gave<00:00:51.230> me<00:00:51.379> the<00:00:51.530> opportunity<00:00:51.739> to

00:00:52.540 --> 00:00:52.550 
and really gave me the opportunity to

00:00:52.550 --> 00:00:55.400 
and really gave me the opportunity to
apply<00:00:52.699> to<00:00:52.789> a<00:00:52.969> great<00:00:53.149> uni<00:00:53.390> like<00:00:53.539> Pearson

00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:55.410 
apply to a great uni like Pearson

00:00:55.410 --> 00:01:01.280 
apply to a great uni like Pearson
I<00:00:56.989> felt<00:00:57.989> it<00:00:58.920> was<00:00:59.010> a<00:00:59.070> bit<00:00:59.160> of<00:00:59.750> disappointment<00:01:00.750> at

00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:01.290 
I felt it was a bit of disappointment at

00:01:01.290 --> 00:01:03.890 
I felt it was a bit of disappointment at
first<00:01:01.620> but<00:01:02.220> also<00:01:02.430> I<00:01:02.670> was<00:01:02.850> optimistic<00:01:03.120> because

00:01:03.890 --> 00:01:03.900 
first but also I was optimistic because

00:01:03.900 --> 00:01:06.380 
first but also I was optimistic because
I<00:01:04.199> thought<00:01:04.379> I<00:01:04.710> always<00:01:05.160> go<00:01:05.370> by<00:01:05.519> the<00:01:05.580> philosophy

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:06.390 
I thought I always go by the philosophy

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:07.910 
I thought I always go by the philosophy
that<00:01:06.420> everything<00:01:06.960> happens<00:01:07.200> for<00:01:07.290> a<00:01:07.380> reason

00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:07.920 
that everything happens for a reason

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:11.030 
that everything happens for a reason
but<00:01:08.100> I<00:01:08.340> said<00:01:08.880> that<00:01:09.150> really<00:01:09.600> I<00:01:09.960> was<00:01:10.440> thinking

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:11.040 
but I said that really I was thinking

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:12.469 
but I said that really I was thinking
more<00:01:11.220> arts<00:01:11.550> couldn't<00:01:11.880> wasn't<00:01:12.150> planning<00:01:12.420> on

00:01:12.469 --> 00:01:12.479 
more arts couldn't wasn't planning on

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:14.630 
more arts couldn't wasn't planning on
going<00:01:12.630> to<00:01:12.780> university<00:01:13.350> I<00:01:13.590> wasn't<00:01:14.280> cut<00:01:14.400> out<00:01:14.430> for

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:14.640 
going to university I wasn't cut out for

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:16.850 
going to university I wasn't cut out for
me<00:01:14.880> I<00:01:14.910> was<00:01:15.180> I<00:01:15.510> needed<00:01:16.140> something<00:01:16.350> more<00:01:16.500> than

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:16.860 
me I was I needed something more than

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:22.790 
me I was I needed something more than
just<00:01:17.190> any<00:01:17.430> university<00:01:18.180> I<00:01:21.590> definitely<00:01:22.590> advise

00:01:22.790 --> 00:01:22.800 
just any university I definitely advise

00:01:22.800 --> 00:01:23.690 
just any university I definitely advise
going<00:01:23.100> through<00:01:23.250> clearing

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:23.700 
going through clearing

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:25.310 
going through clearing
because<00:01:24.240> not<00:01:24.509> only<00:01:24.540> do<00:01:24.840> you<00:01:24.900> know<00:01:25.050> where<00:01:25.229> you

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:25.320 
because not only do you know where you

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:27.590 
because not only do you know where you
stand<00:01:25.560> but<00:01:25.950> also<00:01:26.100> you<00:01:26.940> can<00:01:27.090> make<00:01:27.240> a<00:01:27.270> realistic

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:27.600 
stand but also you can make a realistic

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:32.650 
stand but also you can make a realistic
decision<00:01:28.200> based<00:01:28.410> on<00:01:28.560> your<00:01:28.740> grades<00:01:30.860> for<00:01:31.860> me

00:01:32.650 --> 00:01:32.660 
decision based on your grades for me

00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:35.450 
decision based on your grades for me
many<00:01:33.660> things<00:01:33.960> I<00:01:34.259> would<00:01:34.410> say<00:01:34.680> the<00:01:35.070> fact<00:01:35.340> that

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:35.460 
many things I would say the fact that

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:37.999 
many things I would say the fact that
you're<00:01:36.180> working<00:01:36.509> within<00:01:36.660> a<00:01:36.780> business<00:01:36.960> a<00:01:37.440> huge

00:01:37.999 --> 00:01:38.009 
you're working within a business a huge

00:01:38.009 --> 00:01:40.820 
you're working within a business a huge
