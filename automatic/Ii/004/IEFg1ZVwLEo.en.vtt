00:01:06.859 --> 00:01:06.869 
window and you can see that on this on

00:01:06.869 --> 00:01:09.380 
window and you can see that on this on
the<00:01:07.380> project<00:01:07.920> and<00:01:08.070> the<00:01:08.670> the<00:01:08.939> cool<00:01:09.119> thing<00:01:09.270> about

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:09.390 
the project and the the cool thing about

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:12.710 
the project and the the cool thing about
it<00:01:09.540> is<00:01:09.689> there<00:01:10.020> is<00:01:10.049> a<00:01:10.229> crease<00:01:11.450> accent<00:01:12.450> in<00:01:12.689> the

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:12.720 
it is there is a crease accent in the

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:14.149 
it is there is a crease accent in the
window<00:01:13.140> so<00:01:13.320> it<00:01:13.439> actually<00:01:13.740> puts<00:01:13.890> a<00:01:13.950> little

00:01:14.149 --> 00:01:14.159 
window so it actually puts a little

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:16.280 
window so it actually puts a little
square<00:01:14.700> crease<00:01:15.090> so<00:01:15.270> it<00:01:15.360> makes<00:01:15.750> it<00:01:15.869> look<00:01:16.049> like<00:01:16.080> a

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:16.290 
square crease so it makes it look like a

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:18.530 
square crease so it makes it look like a
real<00:01:16.590> window<00:01:17.009> so<00:01:17.820> let<00:01:17.970> me<00:01:18.090> show<00:01:18.270> you<00:01:18.299> how<00:01:18.479> to

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:18.540 
real window so let me show you how to

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:22.190 
real window so let me show you how to
assemble<00:01:18.930> this<00:01:20.390> I've<00:01:21.390> already<00:01:21.570> cut<00:01:21.840> the<00:01:21.990> box

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:22.200

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:29.520 
all the crease lines I'm going to bend

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:31.280 
all the crease lines I'm going to bend
that's<00:01:29.970> what<00:01:30.119> I<00:01:30.180> do<00:01:30.240> first<00:01:30.570> is<00:01:30.720> I<00:01:30.810> kind<00:01:31.020> of<00:01:31.079> bend

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:31.290 
that's what I do first is I kind of bend

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:33.920 
that's what I do first is I kind of bend
down<00:01:31.470> all<00:01:31.680> my<00:01:31.860> creases<00:01:32.400> and<00:01:32.729> if<00:01:33.150> you<00:01:33.299> are<00:01:33.659> going

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:33.930

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:36.859 
down all my creases and if you are going
to<00:01:34.110> assemble<00:01:34.950> this<00:01:35.159> and<00:01:35.460> don't<00:01:36.090> care<00:01:36.630> if<00:01:36.750> it

00:01:36.859 --> 00:01:36.869 
to assemble this and don't care if it

00:01:36.869 --> 00:01:38.390 
to assemble this and don't care if it
ever<00:01:37.049> opens<00:01:37.500> again<00:01:37.770> if<00:01:37.890> you're<00:01:38.009> just<00:01:38.040> doing<00:01:38.310> it

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:38.400 
ever opens again if you're just doing it

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:42.319 
ever opens again if you're just doing it
