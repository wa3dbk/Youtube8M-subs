00:02:35.699 --> 00:02:35.709 

00:02:35.709 --> 00:02:37.229 

I<00:02:35.739> don't<00:02:36.159> want<00:02:36.280> to<00:02:36.340> say<00:02:36.459> the<00:02:36.579> game<00:02:36.700> slow<00:02:37.000> down

00:02:37.229 --> 00:02:37.239 
I don't want to say the game slow down

00:02:37.239 --> 00:02:39.000 
I don't want to say the game slow down
but<00:02:37.450> hopefully<00:02:37.810> I<00:02:37.870> hopefully<00:02:38.049> I've<00:02:38.829> been

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:39.010 
but hopefully I hopefully I've been

00:02:39.010 --> 00:02:40.619 
but hopefully I hopefully I've been
speeding<00:02:39.340> up<00:02:39.459> a<00:02:39.519> little<00:02:39.549> bit<00:02:39.819> but<00:02:40.030> I<00:02:40.239> guess

00:02:40.619 --> 00:02:40.629 
speeding up a little bit but I guess

00:02:40.629 --> 00:02:42.179 
speeding up a little bit but I guess
that's<00:02:40.810> that<00:02:41.140> was<00:02:41.260> kind<00:02:41.469> of<00:02:41.530> my<00:02:41.650> problem<00:02:41.890> that

00:02:42.179 --> 00:02:42.189 
that's that was kind of my problem that

00:02:42.189 --> 00:02:43.440 
that's that was kind of my problem that
I<00:02:42.219> didn't<00:02:42.549> really<00:02:42.700> keep<00:02:42.849> up<00:02:43.030> with<00:02:43.180> the<00:02:43.239> pace

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:43.450 
I didn't really keep up with the pace

00:02:43.450 --> 00:02:45.270 
I didn't really keep up with the pace
and<00:02:43.689> turned<00:02:43.930> out<00:02:44.079> over<00:02:44.500> the<00:02:44.590> Puckle<00:02:44.920> too<00:02:45.099> much

00:02:45.270 --> 00:02:45.280

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:46.319
