00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.250
 fan girls weather on my channel one 

00:00:02.879 --> 00:00:07.370
 new friend preview this time on 

00:00:05.250 --> 00:00:10.980
 new mascara proposed by dolce gabbana 

00:00:07.370 --> 00:00:13.200
 passion hines then it is a mascara that 

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:18.150
 should give two things warp and 

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:19.980
 volume I did not want to buy but not 

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:21.630
 why I didn't like mascara but 

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:24.510
 because I have so many but I download 

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:26.550
 I'll come back and throw away some then dry up 

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:29.340
 more, some are less annoying though 

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:34.440
 in short, after you've had us for six seven 

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:37.920
 eight months and then I mean me 

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:40.230
 sorry, however, the girl who did it 

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:44.489
 proposed he practically forced me to 

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:48.750
 try it and I decided to buy it 

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:50.789
 then this back 110 is a shoe 

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:52.800
 the silicone brush and you know 

00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:57.329
 that I don't like sterile diggers 

00:00:52.800 --> 00:01:00.079
 silicone but this is interesting is 

00:00:57.329 --> 00:01:00.079
 done this way 

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:08.520
 see from the very shape of the 

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:11.700
 warp recalls a bit of Dior but the 

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:13.830
 silicone with a flat tip that 

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:15.960
 allows to work on the eyelashes and one 

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:17.720
 straight part that allows you to take 

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:20.610
 also among the lower ones 

00:01:17.720 --> 00:01:22.770
 because I bought it bought because 

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:26.280
 between meals in three colors black brown and 

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:29.850
 blue and blue was what I have 

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:33.270
 bought because it is a gray blue but it is a 

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:35.540
 dark blue blue night that I think is 

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:39.180
 by god 

00:01:35.540 --> 00:01:41.390
 in winter there is very cold and when one 

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:43.700
 get up in the morning and wash yourself 

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:46.340
 it's like that or doing the attic in the bathroom 

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:49.220
 I cut to pieces I put the first one which is not 

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:50.780
 colored that I find I go out and sometimes I don't have 

00:01:49.220 --> 00:01:53.000
 want to make up just because there is 

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:56.869
 still peduto and so what I do a 

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:59.119
 sometimes a nice colored gloss that pulls you 

00:01:56.869 --> 00:02:01.880
 on morale and a colorful mascara you 

00:01:59.119 --> 00:02:03.800
 they save on skin because they don't want to 

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:05.900
 to stand there making the nuances at 8 o'clock 

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:07.100
 morning then of furniture to die for 

00:02:05.900 --> 00:02:09.350
 sound angry i want mine 

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:12.020
 boyfriend I keep away from coffee made for 

00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:16.220
 but what I tell him I still had to open 

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:19.250
 eyes and no girls sum am 

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:22.610
 mascara gave me the idea of ​​Rome 

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:24.320
 you slept many hours the color we 

00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:25.940
 put his today in this period 

00:02:24.320 --> 00:02:27.890
 I am very much for blue and pink 

00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:31.070
 then the dark blue mascara with a 

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:34.450
 big rosé save me in the morning 

00:02:31.070 --> 00:02:34.450
 now I apply it and I'll show you 

00:02:37.150 --> 00:02:41.570
 when we have these forms a bit with 

00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:43.970
 the pipe cleaners like that 

00:02:41.570 --> 00:02:45.950
 however, it is good to press to bend the 

00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:49.880
 eyelashes if we have not passed before to 

00:02:45.950 --> 00:02:52.610
 from there, you will see this 

00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:55.790
 mascara doesn't make lumps at all 

00:02:52.610 --> 00:02:58.010
 despite having practically 

00:02:55.790 --> 00:02:59.690
 minicar or micro microsite lines that in 

00:02:58.010 --> 00:03:04.130
 theory should by I had a release 

00:02:59.690 --> 00:03:06.200
 huge product though enormous in reality 

00:03:04.130 --> 00:03:09.799
 they don't do it because they are small but 

00:03:06.200 --> 00:03:13.250
 very thick and how it says and does not 

00:03:09.799 --> 00:03:15.380
 dramas despite ensuring good volume 

00:03:13.250 --> 00:03:18.260
 and good mature care 

00:03:15.380 --> 00:03:21.829
 I find that there is more volume than rubber 

00:03:18.260 --> 00:03:25.070
 it lasts because it is so done that is in theory 

00:03:21.829 --> 00:03:27.140
 at the curve but straight ahead 

00:03:25.070 --> 00:03:29.810
 actually he just doesn't take his eyelashes e 

00:03:27.140 --> 00:03:32.299
 he does this thing more than anything else second 

00:03:29.810 --> 00:03:34.940
 me is the volume that is given by this 

00:03:32.299 --> 00:03:36.709
 mascara you actually know that for 

00:03:34.940 --> 00:03:40.040
 judging a pattern will need me 

00:03:36.709 --> 00:03:42.920
 they spend the first three times at the roots 

00:03:40.040 --> 00:03:44.150
 the second for the drums the third for the 

00:03:42.920 --> 00:03:45.890
 tips 

00:03:44.150 --> 00:03:48.709
 I am here at the first I still do not have 

00:03:45.890 --> 00:03:51.050
 let it dry and I chose 

00:03:48.709 --> 00:03:52.130
 this eye because I always try 

00:03:51.050 --> 00:03:54.020
 right mascara 

00:03:52.130 --> 00:03:55.970
 because now you read even shorter than 

00:03:54.020 --> 00:03:59.030
 on the left then sometimes in the moscow la 

00:03:55.970 --> 00:04:01.520
 left look beautiful on the right look 

00:03:59.030 --> 00:04:03.050
 what difference between one eye and another e 

00:04:01.520 --> 00:04:05.180
 you see that it is a blue 

00:04:03.050 --> 00:04:08.870
 I don't know if you notice in the room, however, at the 

00:04:05.180 --> 00:04:11.690
 light is an elegant blue here is like the 

00:04:08.870 --> 00:04:14.000
 little black dress little black dress when you don't know 

00:04:11.690 --> 00:04:16.940
 what to wear you put on the little black dress 

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:19.730
 here is this mascara in this color mi 

00:04:16.940 --> 00:04:21.500
 it looked like a little black dress and I liked it 

00:04:19.730 --> 00:04:23.810
 I really like the idea of ​​this a lot 

00:04:21.500 --> 00:04:27.020
 blue you see when struck by the 

00:04:23.810 --> 00:04:29.950
 artificial light is seen and not seen e 

00:04:27.020 --> 00:04:32.600
 from an then the elegant and not eyelashes 

00:04:29.950 --> 00:04:34.670
 huge not extreme because I am not 

00:04:32.600 --> 00:04:37.310
 one from extreme mascara 

00:04:34.670 --> 00:04:40.820
 the only problem is that for 7 billion 

00:04:37.310 --> 00:04:43.970
 product and therefore there is little cost 32 

00:04:40.820 --> 00:04:46.730
 euro and 50 for a mascara is not little but 

00:04:43.970 --> 00:04:49.100
 this is somewhat his arrival levo 

00:04:46.730 --> 00:04:50.900
 review also sicily angeles 

00:04:49.100 --> 00:04:53.870
 collection but in the end I made myself 

00:04:50.900 --> 00:04:56.180
 I realize that 4 lipsticks are ok, the year 

00:04:53.870 --> 00:04:59.930
 beautiful stone in the background but I am ours 

00:04:56.180 --> 00:05:02.600
 green one purple with mascara b with i 

00:04:59.930 --> 00:05:05.120
 matched glazes that I do not dispose of 

00:05:02.600 --> 00:05:06.740
 home rock or enamels come out and I have 

00:05:05.120 --> 00:05:08.780
 chosen of not reviewed in veiled that 

00:05:06.740 --> 00:05:11.150
 pay 35 euros 

00:05:08.780 --> 00:05:13.970
 a lipstick that I wear only once 

00:05:11.150 --> 00:05:15.740
 to review it and why it is beautiful 

00:05:13.970 --> 00:05:17.420
 stone I preferred to invest them on 

00:05:15.740 --> 00:05:19.730
 mascara that in the end I know I'll use everyone 

00:05:17.420 --> 00:05:22.730
 the days I 'd like to hear from you again 

00:05:19.730 --> 00:05:24.530

00:05:22.730 --> 00:05:26.930
 then many that I review on my blog 

00:05:24.530 --> 00:05:28.850
 up to a review blog where in face 

00:05:26.930 --> 00:05:30.530
 cream also include some good notes 

00:05:28.850 --> 00:05:32.450
 on the basic rules of make-up 

00:05:30.530 --> 00:05:34.400
 subscribe to my blog because really 

00:05:32.450 --> 00:05:37.700
 what they fail to survey the 

00:05:34.400 --> 00:05:40.990
 Video reviewed it drains well hope so 

00:05:37.700 --> 00:05:40.990
 the useful recipe is a big kiss
