00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:09.349
 It also whether that right now I'm in the I's right to Tonsatake's specific Anomaa this 

00:00:05.450 --> 00:00:14.240
 When I was a book or is but I do not know if there is a temple to say example that of 

00:00:09.349 --> 00:00:19.220
 A legacy movie ghostwriter wrote to tell the pianist's name no good child 

00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:20.520
 In fact, it is also said that it was not possible to hear your ears 

00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:24.630
 It was because I heard it 

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:34.910
 There I if I think that will come out is a also a big difference at say selfish 

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:39.200
 Well I think I think that the listener is that it places, or rather what you were looking for the work itself 

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:45.860
 Is it really a song written by someone who can not hear him 

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:46.730
 The wonderful work is wonderful regardless of whether the man of Kenjo who can hear the ear has returned 

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:53.269
 I think 

00:00:46.730 --> 00:00:54.680
 If so, then separately from the strider, buyers should not change the evaluation of the work 

00:00:53.269 --> 00:00:54.930
 Hey, but what is 

00:00:54.680 --> 00:01:00.780
 so 

00:00:54.930 --> 00:01:06.630
 It is criticized so far that there is a voice that it is not a fraud 

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:08.160
 I think that writing is that I was looking for added value there, that is the song 

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:11.340
 Not only greatness 

00:01:08.160 --> 00:01:14.920
 Because people who can not hear this wrote this 

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:21.700
 So it was there is added value Speaking'm great 

00:01:14.920 --> 00:01:23.560
 There is no doubt that I say so, so what is it called added value or discrimination? 

00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:27.340
 It's a little difficult 

00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:31.690
 I 'm really that since I was jealous 

00:01:27.340 --> 00:01:34.909
 It Tteyuu be praised just did the same thing everyone else is often Tan 

00:01:31.690 --> 00:01:37.610
 For example, writing or eating 

00:01:34.909 --> 00:01:43.340
 Walk Toka only that 

00:01:37.610 --> 00:01:43.790
 I can't say that I can do such a song, and I am punished by the mothers around me 

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:50.000
 Ne 

00:01:43.790 --> 00:01:50.960
 I thought in me I would not be praised only me even though it has already been that the same with everyone drinking beg for it 

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:55.729
 It was 

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:57.600
 Well good idea After Oh I see people with disabilities say I would not do anything Well 

00:01:55.729 --> 00:02:00.659
 Because there is a premise spa 

00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:05.940
 Everyone the same Kotoshite also guess only you can be praised 

00:02:00.659 --> 00:02:08.970
 It seems like it is being sold a little below to be praised when it comes 

00:02:05.940 --> 00:02:15.470
 That's what I thought was complicated . 

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:19.970
 I think that there is a place that goes well with this problem 

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:25.850
 But as a result, I thought it was grateful to me . 

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:33.080
 So I wondered how I could accept the compliments honestly 

00:02:25.850 --> 00:02:34.670
 It is not the same as everyone in the place, but it is the result only if it is higher than everyone else its obstacle 

00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:35.490
 Not because they are 

00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:39.360
 Results and to 1 

00:02:35.490 --> 00:02:43.110
 I wonder if this person is wonderful and can not accept it 

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:45.330
 So I thought that I wanted to be the best in my class and I would like to win my ears beautifully 

00:02:43.110 --> 00:02:48.600
 Hey positive 

00:02:45.330 --> 00:02:51.800
 g Do you care too much? 

00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:51.800
 I can draw quite beautifully 

00:03:04.170 --> 00:03:14.989
 Buber summer doing something better of us Mabeki pastry 

00:03:11.090 --> 00:03:17.170
 In comparison with that, I think that I do what I do and I am very enthusiastic 

00:03:14.989 --> 00:03:17.170
 Yup
