00:00:17.210 --> 00:00:20.210
 do not 

00:00:25.079 --> 00:00:29.719
 one more day we are with all of you here in the administrator at home to 

00:00:29.719 --> 00:00:32.780
 correspond to the will of the general council of colleges of administrators 

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:34.420
 of farms of Spain 

00:00:34.420 --> 00:00:37.780
 declared of conflicts that have to do with housing and home 

00:00:37.780 --> 00:00:40.780
 to introduce that topic today we go out into the street 

00:00:41.630 --> 00:00:45.370
 the balcony is part of the common or exclusive elements of a farm 

00:00:45.370 --> 00:00:46.690
 the repression 

00:00:46.690 --> 00:00:48.060
 common 

00:00:48.060 --> 00:00:49.560
 I think 

00:00:49.560 --> 00:00:50.609
 In latin 

00:00:50.609 --> 00:00:51.840
 piaggio 

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:53.190
 proprietary 

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:56.030
 how the maintenance tasks of a balcony between 

00:00:56.030 --> 00:00:58.080
 community of users 

00:00:58.080 --> 00:00:59.890
 I have no idea 

00:00:59.890 --> 00:01:01.690
 a bone like that should be lost 

00:01:01.690 --> 00:01:04.690
 he passes it because that proposal of 

00:01:05.200 --> 00:01:08.200
 enter the community 

00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:13.580
 I think the singer is wrong it's bad that the community but 

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:17.000
 on the top he makes in Bashkiria the view is in Spain 

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:18.490
 the user 

00:01:18.490 --> 00:01:21.370
 you can transform a balcony into a gallery 

00:01:21.370 --> 00:01:24.180
 I think so 

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:26.160
 I would never do it 

00:01:26.160 --> 00:01:28.100
 this decision has gone 

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:33.470
 mingora agreement between the as between the altea xl february in the building could 

00:01:34.400 --> 00:01:37.880
 just to make a line I guess it depends on 

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:40.170
 the municipal ordinances 

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:44.479
 it was not known to see each case you will have all solution of all these issues that we have 

00:01:44.479 --> 00:01:47.700
 proposed to our fellow citizens last Saturday is now our 

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:50.700
 reportage 

00:01:51.680 --> 00:01:55.850
 the balcony is part of the common elements of the farm although its use and 

00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:57.500
 privative enjoyment 

00:01:57.500 --> 00:02:00.950
 the fact of being part of the general structure of the building entails 

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:04.320
 that the aesthetics of balconies can not be transformed, much less 

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:09.040
 can not be used freely as a warehouse or for 

00:02:09.039 --> 00:02:13.110
 accumulate objects in case of restoration works and consolidation of 

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:17.020
 materials the payment corresponds to the community of owners the 

00:02:17.020 --> 00:02:20.209
 ordinary maintenance corresponds to the owner user 

00:02:20.209 --> 00:02:24.790
 it should also be checked that the awnings and flowerpots are well 

00:02:24.790 --> 00:02:28.989
 fixed to avoid falling into the street the responsibility of a bad fixation in 

00:02:28.989 --> 00:02:33.219
 case of accident corresponds to the occupant of the floor assuming that the 

00:02:33.219 --> 00:02:36.700
 municipal and town planning regulations allow the tenant who wants to close 

00:02:36.700 --> 00:02:41.239
 the balcony to gain living space and make a gallery should ask 

00:02:41.239 --> 00:02:45.019
 permission to the community board because it affects the aesthetics of the 

00:02:45.019 --> 00:02:45.839
 building 

00:02:45.839 --> 00:02:49.799
 If you carry out the works without this permit, any other owner may 

00:02:49.799 --> 00:02:54.239
 denounce it instead if it was to make a complaint the next step plays to your 

00:02:54.239 --> 00:02:58.779
 Please the courts are usually very restrictive when it comes to sanctioning 

00:02:58.779 --> 00:03:02.909
 this was not raised at the time before the work was a fait accompli 

00:03:03.569 --> 00:03:06.870
 As every week, you ask us a series of questions 

00:03:06.870 --> 00:03:10.110
 our answers are obviously used to pay debts 

00:03:10.110 --> 00:03:13.630
 however it would not hurt to follow our usual advice to 

00:03:13.630 --> 00:03:17.490
 deepen for example in cdc the very concrete difficult to answer from 

00:03:17.490 --> 00:03:21.760
 a generalized form for it the best go to join minister of fincas 

00:03:21.760 --> 00:03:24.539
 collegiate ephemeral very gladly 

00:03:24.539 --> 00:03:27.539
 one 

00:03:29.489 --> 00:03:33.310
 Athens DÃ­az has installed private banking on a staircase since the 

00:03:33.310 --> 00:03:34.249
 at that time 

00:03:34.249 --> 00:03:35.629
 how to grow 

00:03:35.629 --> 00:03:38.799
 on the right claim to be withdrawn or there will be canada 

00:03:39.639 --> 00:03:43.349
 if surveillance has been installed in community stimulus units 

00:03:43.349 --> 00:03:44.510
 hallways and so on 

00:03:44.510 --> 00:03:48.209
 will require prior authorization from the community regarding the issue of 

00:03:48.209 --> 00:03:51.970
 safety see it from the positive point of view now there is a person who 

00:03:51.970 --> 00:03:56.069
 24 hours a day, it watches over the security of the bank office and 

00:03:56.069 --> 00:04:00.030
 supposes that it serves taking advantage of the occasion of intimidating element for 

00:04:00.030 --> 00:04:03.109
 any suspect who can haunt the building 

00:04:03.109 --> 00:04:07.180
 if you still consider that the watchman attends to your privacy as those 

00:04:07.180 --> 00:04:11.359
 people who accompany you at a certain moment, communicate it to the food 

00:04:11.359 --> 00:04:14.279
 by itself you have to make any kind of complaint or suggestion to the bank in 

00:04:14.279 --> 00:04:14.969
 question 

00:04:14.969 --> 00:04:18.569
 I have some neighbors who play loud music and annoy patio door 

00:04:19.900 --> 00:04:24.510
 although there are hours outside of next to this one can also do some 

00:04:24.509 --> 00:04:26.430
 complaint was to ask for help 

00:04:26.430 --> 00:04:30.139
 If the destination is from their own community they should try to solve it in good 

00:04:30.139 --> 00:04:30.849
 ways 

00:04:30.849 --> 00:04:34.330
 the most effective way is to expose the theme the president of the community to 

00:04:34.330 --> 00:04:37.969
 to inform the neighbor of the inconvenience that he creates so that 

00:04:37.969 --> 00:04:42.809
 give up your attitude if after a while the complaints persist communicate to the 

00:04:42.809 --> 00:04:46.660
 municipal police so that in this case they apply the municipal ordinances in 

00:04:46.659 --> 00:04:48.539
 noise matter 

00:04:48.539 --> 00:04:51.539
 one 

00:04:52.599 --> 00:04:54.760
