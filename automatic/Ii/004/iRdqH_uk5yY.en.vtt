00:01:27.010 --> 00:01:27.020 
different sounding that I thought it

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:28.810 
different sounding that I thought it
would<00:01:27.170> be<00:01:27.320> best<00:01:27.530> to<00:01:27.649> make<00:01:27.859> different<00:01:28.340> videos

00:01:28.810 --> 00:01:28.820 
would be best to make different videos

00:01:28.820 --> 00:01:31.480 
would be best to make different videos
for<00:01:29.329> it<00:01:29.420> so<00:01:29.539> go<00:01:30.079> check<00:01:30.259> that<00:01:30.439> one<00:01:30.649> out<00:01:30.740> anyway

00:01:31.480 --> 00:01:31.490 
for it so go check that one out anyway

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:33.429 
for it so go check that one out anyway

my ts9 and I'm going to roll the gain

00:02:57.970 --> 00:03:00.120 
my ts9 and I'm going to roll the gain
all<00:02:58.270> the<00:02:58.420> way<00:02:58.570> out<00:02:58.750> and<00:02:59.020> I'm<00:02:59.620> going<00:02:59.800> to<00:02:59.860> take

00:03:02.190 --> 00:03:02.200 
the tone knob and I'm going to put it at

00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:04.680 
the tone knob and I'm going to put it at
about<00:03:02.380> 8<00:03:02.590> o'clock<00:03:02.620> and<00:03:03.250> that<00:03:03.760> takes<00:03:04.090> a<00:03:04.270> lot<00:03:04.630> of

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:04.690 
about 8 o'clock and that takes a lot of

00:03:04.690 --> 00:03:06.570 
about 8 o'clock and that takes a lot of
the<00:03:04.990> treble<00:03:05.320> out<00:03:05.530> of<00:03:05.650> the<00:03:05.710> circuit<00:03:06.130> because<00:03:06.460> if

00:03:06.570 --> 00:03:06.580 
the treble out of the circuit because if

00:03:06.580 --> 00:03:08.130 
the treble out of the circuit because if
I<00:03:06.700> don't<00:03:07.000> it<00:03:07.270> just<00:03:07.510> gets<00:03:07.720> a<00:03:07.840> little<00:03:08.020> bit

00:03:08.130 --> 00:03:08.140 
I don't it just gets a little bit

00:03:08.140 --> 00:03:11.760 
I don't it just gets a little bit
brittle<00:03:08.560> still<00:03:08.980> so<00:03:09.880> here's<00:03:10.630> the<00:03:10.870> I<00:03:11.290> like<00:03:11.590> to

00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:11.770 
brittle still so here's the I like to

00:03:11.770 --> 00:03:13.650 
brittle still so here's the I like to
kind<00:03:12.070> of<00:03:12.130> zero<00:03:12.370> out<00:03:12.550> my<00:03:12.700> pedals<00:03:13.060> I<00:03:13.150> like<00:03:13.330> to<00:03:13.480> try

00:03:13.650 --> 00:03:13.660 
kind of zero out my pedals I like to try

00:03:13.660 --> 00:03:15.150 
kind of zero out my pedals I like to try
to<00:03:13.720> make<00:03:13.960> it<00:03:13.990> sound<00:03:14.290> like<00:03:14.470> the<00:03:14.620> pedal<00:03:14.860> is<00:03:14.980> not

00:03:15.150 --> 00:03:15.160 
to make it sound like the pedal is not

00:03:15.160 --> 00:03:17.520 
to make it sound like the pedal is not
on<00:03:15.370> as<00:03:15.670> much<00:03:16.150> as<00:03:16.210> I<00:03:16.450> can<00:03:16.720> and<00:03:16.930> then<00:03:17.050> tweak<00:03:17.350> from

00:03:17.520 --> 00:03:17.530 
on as much as I can and then tweak from

00:03:17.530 --> 00:03:18.960 
on as much as I can and then tweak from
there<00:03:17.800> especially<00:03:18.370> when<00:03:18.490> I'm<00:03:18.580> working<00:03:18.610> with<00:03:18.880> a

00:03:18.960 --> 00:03:18.970 
there especially when I'm working with a

00:03:18.970 --> 00:03:22.410 
there especially when I'm working with a
pedal<00:03:19.209> of<00:03:19.270> the<00:03:19.330> first<00:03:19.540> time<00:03:19.750> so<00:03:21.300> that's<00:03:22.300> the

00:03:22.410 --> 00:03:22.420 
pedal of the first time so that's the

00:03:22.420 --> 00:03:28.920 
pedal of the first time so that's the
amp<00:03:23.370> and<00:03:25.260> that's<00:03:26.260> the<00:03:26.440> pedal<00:03:26.800> and<00:03:27.430> oh<00:03:28.180> man

00:03:28.920 --> 00:03:28.930 
amp and that's the pedal and oh man

00:03:28.930 --> 00:03:32.940 
amp and that's the pedal and oh man
really<00:03:29.490> there<00:03:30.490> it<00:03:30.610> goes<00:03:30.900> my<00:03:31.900> cable<00:03:32.470> is<00:03:32.590> dying

00:03:32.940 --> 00:03:32.950 
really there it goes my cable is dying

00:03:32.950 --> 00:03:39.449 
really there it goes my cable is dying
there<00:03:35.370> my<00:03:36.370> cables<00:03:36.670> starting<00:03:37.300> to<00:03:37.360> die<00:03:38.190> ok<00:03:39.190> well

00:03:39.449 --> 00:03:39.459 
there my cables starting to die ok well

00:03:39.459 --> 00:03:53.960 
there my cables starting to die ok well
here<00:03:39.820> we<00:03:39.940> go<00:03:41.160> amp<00:03:43.739> pedal<00:03:44.739> not<00:03:45.400> that<00:03:45.550> different

00:03:53.960 --> 00:03:53.970 

00:03:53.970 --> 00:03:56.690 

little<00:03:54.970> color<00:03:55.180> to<00:03:55.300> it<00:03:55.630> I<00:03:55.720> think<00:03:55.780> a<00:03:56.140> little<00:03:56.320> bit

00:03:56.690 --> 00:03:56.700 
little color to it I think a little bit

00:03:56.700 --> 00:03:59.880 
little color to it I think a little bit
if<00:03:57.700> I<00:03:57.910> roll<00:03:58.239> the<00:03:58.540> tone<00:03:58.989> knob<00:03:59.230> up<00:03:59.500> to<00:03:59.709> about

00:03:59.880 --> 00:03:59.890 
if I roll the tone knob up to about

00:03:59.890 --> 00:04:07.680 
if I roll the tone knob up to about
middle<00:04:05.610> so<00:04:06.610> that<00:04:06.790> that's<00:04:07.030> a<00:04:07.150> knee<00:04:07.209> up<00:04:07.330> this<00:04:07.540> is

00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:07.690 
middle so that that's a knee up this is

00:04:07.690 --> 00:04:11.850 
middle so that that's a knee up this is
pedal<00:04:09.510> I<00:04:10.510> don't<00:04:11.200> know<00:04:11.260> I<00:04:11.290> like<00:04:11.560> it<00:04:11.590> a<00:04:11.770> little

00:04:11.850 --> 00:04:11.860 
pedal I don't know I like it a little

00:04:11.860 --> 00:04:12.449 
pedal I don't know I like it a little
darker

00:04:12.449 --> 00:04:12.459 
darker

00:04:12.459 --> 00:04:14.460 
darker

everybody likes it more treble your

00:04:15.790 --> 00:04:18.150 
everybody likes it more treble your
darker<00:04:16.150> I<00:04:16.270> tend<00:04:16.750> to<00:04:16.780> like<00:04:16.959> darker<00:04:17.350> myself<00:04:17.980> but

00:04:18.150 --> 00:04:18.160 
darker I tend to like darker myself but

00:04:18.160 --> 00:04:20.099 
darker I tend to like darker myself but
that's<00:04:18.430> probably<00:04:18.940> why<00:04:19.570> I<00:04:19.600> like<00:04:19.780> this

00:04:20.099 --> 00:04:20.109 
that's probably why I like this

00:04:20.109 --> 00:04:21.390 
that's probably why I like this
particular<00:04:20.290> pedal<00:04:20.799> so<00:04:20.890> much<00:04:21.070> this<00:04:21.220> is<00:04:21.280> a<00:04:21.340> very

00:04:21.390 --> 00:04:21.400 
particular pedal so much this is a very

00:04:21.400 --> 00:04:24.210 
particular pedal so much this is a very
dark<00:04:21.790> pedal<00:04:22.300> I<00:04:22.450> have<00:04:22.870> a<00:04:22.900> Robert<00:04:23.289> Keeley<00:04:23.770> modded

00:04:24.210 --> 00:04:24.220 
dark pedal I have a Robert Keeley modded

00:04:24.220 --> 00:04:27.180 
dark pedal I have a Robert Keeley modded
ts9<00:04:24.760> DX<00:04:25.240> that's<00:04:25.479> a<00:04:25.600> very<00:04:25.870> bright<00:04:26.289> pedal

00:04:27.180 --> 00:04:27.190 
ts9 DX that's a very bright pedal

00:04:27.190 --> 00:04:28.950 
ts9 DX that's a very bright pedal
so<00:04:27.400> I<00:04:27.430> tend<00:04:27.790> to<00:04:27.850> like<00:04:28.000> the<00:04:28.180> darker<00:04:28.510> pedal<00:04:28.780> so

00:04:28.950 --> 00:04:28.960 
so I tend to like the darker pedal so

00:04:28.960 --> 00:04:39.090 
so I tend to like the darker pedal so
everybody's<00:04:29.560> different<00:04:37.650> see<00:04:38.650> I<00:04:38.680> like<00:04:38.950> the

00:04:39.090 --> 00:04:39.100 
everybody's different see I like the

00:04:39.100 --> 00:04:40.290 
everybody's different see I like the
tone<00:04:39.250> of<00:04:39.400> that<00:04:39.430> I<00:04:39.520> mean<00:04:39.640> the<00:04:39.760> games<00:04:39.970> all<00:04:40.210> the

00:04:40.290 --> 00:04:40.300 
tone of that I mean the games all the

00:04:40.300 --> 00:04:41.640 
tone of that I mean the games all the
way<00:04:40.390> down<00:04:40.540> but<00:04:40.630> it's<00:04:40.780> nice<00:04:40.930> all<00:04:41.380> right<00:04:41.440> let's

00:04:41.640 --> 00:04:41.650
