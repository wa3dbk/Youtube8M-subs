than<00:03:37.209> previous<00:03:37.570> versions<00:03:37.600> of<00:03:38.080> his<00:03:38.230> card<00:03:38.500> and

00:03:38.640 --> 00:03:38.650 
than previous versions of his card and

00:03:38.650 --> 00:03:40.830 
than previous versions of his card and
he<00:03:38.739> will<00:03:39.190> never<00:03:39.400> be<00:03:39.610> like<00:03:39.850> Sturridge<00:03:40.360> that<00:03:40.660> he

00:03:40.830 --> 00:03:40.840 
he will never be like Sturridge that he

00:03:40.840 --> 00:03:42.960 
he will never be like Sturridge that he
will<00:03:40.959> win<00:03:40.989> balls<00:03:41.650> because<00:03:42.250> of<00:03:42.400> his<00:03:42.519> pace<00:03:42.760> and

00:03:42.960 --> 00:03:42.970 
will win balls because of his pace and

00:03:42.970 --> 00:03:44.670 
will win balls because of his pace and
acceleration<00:03:43.690> he<00:03:43.870> will<00:03:44.019> win<00:03:44.200> it<00:03:44.320> because<00:03:44.410> of

00:03:44.670 --> 00:03:44.680 
acceleration he will win it because of

00:03:44.680 --> 00:03:46.949 
acceleration he will win it because of
his<00:03:44.830> height<00:03:45.100> strength<00:03:45.940> ability<00:03:46.510> to<00:03:46.690> settle
