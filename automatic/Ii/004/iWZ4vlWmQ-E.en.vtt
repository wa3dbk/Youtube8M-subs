listen to rock music the only thing

00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:37.700 
listen to rock music the only thing
that's<00:02:36.480> really<00:02:36.630> lacking<00:02:36.960> in<00:02:37.230> the<00:02:37.350> sound<00:02:37.560> is

00:02:37.700 --> 00:02:37.710 
that's really lacking in the sound is

00:02:37.710 --> 00:02:40.550 
that's really lacking in the sound is
the<00:02:37.860> mid-range<00:02:38.180> and<00:02:39.180> it's<00:02:39.660> it's<00:02:39.990> sometimes

00:02:40.550 --> 00:02:40.560 
the mid-range and it's it's sometimes

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:42.800 
the mid-range and it's it's sometimes
there<00:02:40.830> but<00:02:41.580> when<00:02:41.880> especially<00:02:42.270> when<00:02:42.570> there's<00:02:42.720> a

00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:42.810 
there but when especially when there's a

00:02:42.810 --> 00:02:44.450 
there but when especially when there's a
lot<00:02:42.990> of<00:02:43.140> bass<00:02:43.320> or<00:02:43.530> a<00:02:43.560> lot<00:02:43.710> of<00:02:43.830> trouble<00:02:44.130> or<00:02:44.220> both

00:02:44.450 --> 00:02:44.460 
lot of bass or a lot of trouble or both

00:02:44.460 --> 00:02:46.550 
lot of bass or a lot of trouble or both
the<00:02:45.060> mid-range<00:02:45.420> kind<00:02:45.720> of<00:02:45.780> gets<00:02:45.930> drowned<00:02:46.230> out<00:02:46.530> a

00:02:46.550 --> 00:02:46.560 
the mid-range kind of gets drowned out a

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:50.230 
the mid-range kind of gets drowned out a
little<00:02:46.830> bit<00:02:47.070> um<00:02:48.230> but<00:02:49.230> they<00:02:49.350> sound<00:02:49.620> fantastic

00:02:50.230 --> 00:02:50.240 
little bit um but they sound fantastic

00:02:50.240 --> 00:02:52.310 
little bit um but they sound fantastic
the<00:02:51.240> only<00:02:51.390> thing<00:02:51.540> is<00:02:51.660> these<00:02:51.840> were<00:02:52.020> you<00:02:52.290> know

00:02:52.310 --> 00:02:52.320 
the only thing is these were you know

00:02:52.320 --> 00:02:55.010 
the only thing is these were you know
made<00:02:52.650> to<00:02:52.890> plug<00:02:53.130> into<00:02:53.310> a<00:02:53.490> big<00:02:53.940> you<00:02:54.870> know<00:02:54.900> a

00:02:55.010 --> 00:02:55.020 
made to plug into a big you know a

00:02:55.020 --> 00:02:57.170 
made to plug into a big you know a
stereo<00:02:55.410> system<00:02:55.680> a<00:02:55.950> big<00:02:56.160> amplifier<00:02:56.700> or<00:02:57.000> whatnot

00:02:57.170 --> 00:02:57.180 
stereo system a big amplifier or whatnot

00:02:57.180 --> 00:03:00.620 
stereo system a big amplifier or whatnot
and<00:02:57.570> so<00:02:58.130> they're<00:02:59.130> not<00:02:59.310> very<00:02:59.580> powerful<00:03:00.480> on

00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:00.630 
and so they're not very powerful on

00:03:00.630 --> 00:03:02.300 
and so they're not very powerful on
their<00:03:00.810> own<00:03:00.960> which<00:03:01.650> means<00:03:01.950> that<00:03:02.130> when<00:03:02.220> I'm

00:03:02.300 --> 00:03:02.310 
their own which means that when I'm

00:03:02.310 --> 00:03:04.730 
their own which means that when I'm
listening<00:03:02.490> to<00:03:02.780> say<00:03:03.780> you<00:03:04.200> know<00:03:04.320> got<00:03:04.470> plugged

00:03:04.730 --> 00:03:04.740 
listening to say you know got plugged

00:03:04.740 --> 00:03:06.680 
listening to say you know got plugged
into<00:03:04.860> my<00:03:05.010> iPhone<00:03:05.100> I<00:03:05.640> have<00:03:06.090> to<00:03:06.360> turn<00:03:06.510> up<00:03:06.570> the

00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:06.690 
into my iPhone I have to turn up the

00:03:06.690 --> 00:03:09.100 
into my iPhone I have to turn up the
volume<00:03:06.900> significantly<00:03:07.800> more<00:03:08.040> than<00:03:08.250> I<00:03:08.310> would

00:03:09.100 --> 00:03:09.110 
volume significantly more than I would

00:03:09.110 --> 00:03:12.650 
volume significantly more than I would
with<00:03:10.110> newer<00:03:10.980> pair<00:03:11.310> of<00:03:11.400> headphones<00:03:11.580> and<00:03:12.090> so

00:03:12.650 --> 00:03:12.660 
with newer pair of headphones and so

00:03:12.660 --> 00:03:13.910 
with newer pair of headphones and so
that<00:03:12.780> means<00:03:12.870> they<00:03:13.020> don't<00:03:13.110> get<00:03:13.320> quite<00:03:13.470> as<00:03:13.770> loud

00:03:13.910 --> 00:03:13.920 
that means they don't get quite as loud

00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:16.130 
that means they don't get quite as loud
but<00:03:14.190> I<00:03:14.220> they<00:03:15.180> get<00:03:15.360> loud<00:03:15.540> enough<00:03:15.780> for<00:03:15.810> me<00:03:16.080> at

00:03:16.130 --> 00:03:16.140 
but I they get loud enough for me at

00:03:16.140 --> 00:03:18.470 
but I they get loud enough for me at
about<00:03:16.230> 75%<00:03:17.040> of<00:03:17.370> the<00:03:17.459> volume<00:03:17.760> or<00:03:18.120> when<00:03:18.360> my

00:03:18.470 --> 00:03:18.480 
about 75% of the volume or when my

00:03:18.480 --> 00:03:21.350 
about 75% of the volume or when my
volume<00:03:19.050> is<00:03:19.170> up<00:03:19.290> about<00:03:19.470> 75%<00:03:20.090> so<00:03:21.090> that's<00:03:21.209> not

00:03:21.350 --> 00:03:21.360 
volume is up about 75% so that's not

00:03:21.360 --> 00:03:24.620 
volume is up about 75% so that's not
really<00:03:21.480> been<00:03:21.660> an<00:03:21.780> issue<00:03:21.959> for<00:03:22.140> me<00:03:22.380> um<00:03:23.540> so<00:03:24.540> yeah

00:03:32.780 --> 00:03:32.790 
these headphones like I said there's

00:03:32.790 --> 00:03:37.240 
these headphones like I said there's
that<00:03:33.000> kind<00:03:33.720> of<00:03:34.400> weird<00:03:35.400> light<00:03:35.820> brown<00:03:36.150> color

00:03:37.240 --> 00:03:37.250 
that kind of weird light brown color

00:03:37.250 --> 00:03:39.740 
that kind of weird light brown color
it's<00:03:38.250> not<00:03:38.340> the<00:03:38.550> best<00:03:38.730> thing<00:03:38.850> ever<00:03:39.090> but<00:03:39.270> I<00:03:39.330> need

00:03:39.740 --> 00:03:39.750 
it's not the best thing ever but I need

00:03:39.750 --> 00:03:41.660 
it's not the best thing ever but I need
to<00:03:39.810> make<00:03:39.959> it<00:03:40.260> makes<00:03:40.860> it<00:03:41.010> very<00:03:41.130> obvious<00:03:41.340> that

00:03:41.660 --> 00:03:41.670 
to make it makes it very obvious that

00:03:41.670 --> 00:03:43.070 
to make it makes it very obvious that
these<00:03:41.820> are<00:03:41.940> old<00:03:42.120> so<00:03:42.420> I<00:03:42.450> mean<00:03:42.750> if<00:03:42.870> you're

00:03:43.070 --> 00:03:43.080 
these are old so I mean if you're

00:03:43.080 --> 00:03:45.770

00:03:45.770 --> 00:03:45.780 
looking to stand out from that

00:03:45.780 --> 00:03:48.020 
looking to stand out from that
perspective<00:03:46.019> they<00:03:46.410> work<00:03:46.560> really<00:03:46.769> well<00:03:47.030> the

00:03:48.020 --> 00:03:48.030 
perspective they work really well the
