00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:36.200 
took some time to install the headlight
I<00:00:33.570> took<00:00:33.960> because<00:00:34.860> I<00:00:34.950> had<00:00:35.100> to<00:00:35.219> modify<00:00:35.760> so<00:00:36.030> made

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:38.479 
I took because I had to modify so made
damn<00:00:36.420> different<00:00:36.870> things<00:00:37.110> to<00:00:37.440> it<00:00:37.620> to<00:00:37.800> make<00:00:38.190> it

00:00:38.479 --> 00:00:38.489 
damn different things to it to make it

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:40.549 
damn different things to it to make it
fit<00:00:38.910> to<00:00:39.149> make<00:00:39.360> it<00:00:39.510> work<00:00:39.719> to<00:00:39.750> make<00:00:40.140> it<00:00:40.170> so<00:00:40.410> it's

00:00:40.549 --> 00:00:40.559 
fit to make it work to make it so it's

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:42.979 
fit to make it work to make it so it's
legal<00:00:41.010> because<00:00:41.160> when<00:00:41.489> I<00:00:41.520> first<00:00:41.820> got<00:00:42.510> it<00:00:42.690> done<00:00:42.960> I

00:00:42.979 --> 00:00:42.989 
legal because when I first got it done I

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:45.770 
legal because when I first got it done I
thought<00:00:43.500> the<00:00:44.160> headlight<00:00:44.610> was<00:00:44.730> shining<00:00:45.059> way<00:00:45.450> up

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:45.780 
thought the headlight was shining way up

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:50.990 
thought the headlight was shining way up
so<00:00:45.989> that<00:00:46.020> way<00:00:46.320> if<00:00:46.739> I'm<00:00:48.020> if<00:00:49.020> I<00:00:49.230> was<00:00:49.469> to<00:00:49.800> be<00:00:50.700> behind

00:00:50.990 --> 00:00:51.000 
so that way if I'm if I was to be behind

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:52.939 
so that way if I'm if I was to be behind
a<00:00:51.090> truck<00:00:51.360> or<00:00:51.570> something<00:00:51.780> with<00:00:52.079> Sean<00:00:52.500> right<00:00:52.800> in

00:00:52.939 --> 00:00:52.949 
a truck or something with Sean right in

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:54.889 
a truck or something with Sean right in
her<00:00:53.010> face<00:00:53.070> it<00:00:54.000> would<00:00:54.120> really<00:00:54.360> suck<00:00:54.600> I'd<00:00:54.780> be

00:00:54.889 --> 00:00:54.899 
her face it would really suck I'd be

00:00:54.899 --> 00:00:57.670 
her face it would really suck I'd be
like<00:00:55.079> I<00:00:55.350> was<00:00:55.559> riding<00:00:56.280> around<00:00:56.370> in<00:00:56.670> high<00:00:56.910> beams

00:00:57.670 --> 00:00:57.680 
like I was riding around in high beams

00:00:57.680 --> 00:01:01.069 
like I was riding around in high beams
so<00:00:58.680> right<00:00:59.280> now<00:00:59.430> everything<00:00:59.640> works<00:01:00.329> everything

00:01:01.069 --> 00:01:01.079 
so right now everything works everything

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:04.100 
so right now everything works everything
is<00:01:01.199> great<00:01:01.530> and<00:01:01.800> I<00:01:02.670> love<00:01:02.699> it<00:01:03.059> and<00:01:03.210> it's<00:01:03.870> making

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:04.110 
is great and I love it and it's making

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:07.160 
is great and I love it and it's making
huge<00:01:04.559> changes<00:01:04.619> and<00:01:05.430> also<00:01:06.240> I<00:01:06.270> got<00:01:06.450> the<00:01:06.900> chin

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:07.170 
huge changes and also I got the chin

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:11.679

so<00:01:12.259> this<00:01:12.679> is<00:01:12.829> what<00:01:12.979> this<00:01:13.130> view<00:01:13.429> is<00:01:13.609> right<00:01:13.819> now<00:01:13.969> I

00:01:13.989 --> 00:01:13.999 
so this is what this view is right now I

00:01:13.999 --> 00:01:15.730 
so this is what this view is right now I
think<00:01:14.270> I<00:01:14.329> got<00:01:14.479> another<00:01:14.869> little<00:01:15.109> bracket<00:01:15.590> onto

00:01:15.730 --> 00:01:15.740 
think I got another little bracket onto

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:17.980 
think I got another little bracket onto
it<00:01:16.069> to<00:01:16.189> make<00:01:16.340> it<00:01:16.490> so<00:01:16.609> it<00:01:16.729> angles<00:01:17.060> up<00:01:17.179> more<00:01:17.479> so

00:01:17.980 --> 00:01:17.990 
it to make it so it angles up more so

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:19.270 
it to make it so it angles up more so
that<00:01:18.109> way<00:01:18.229> you're<00:01:18.380> not<00:01:18.409> seeing<00:01:18.740> so<00:01:18.950> much<00:01:19.069> my

00:01:19.270 --> 00:01:19.280 
that way you're not seeing so much my

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:21.039 
that way you're not seeing so much my
bike<00:01:19.549> my<00:01:19.909> windshield<00:01:20.240> and<00:01:20.539> everything<00:01:20.929> you

00:01:21.039 --> 00:01:21.049

could<00:01:21.200> look<00:01:21.439> over<00:01:21.649> like<00:01:22.069> I<00:01:22.250> am<00:01:22.429> right<00:01:22.640> now<00:01:22.819> and

00:01:23.169 --> 00:01:23.179 
could look over like I am right now and

00:01:23.179 --> 00:01:27.999 
could look over like I am right now and
I<00:01:24.429> don't<00:01:25.429> know<00:01:25.640> I<00:01:25.880> got<00:01:26.479> a<00:01:26.509> a<00:01:26.600> just<00:01:27.380> make<00:01:27.560> a<00:01:27.590> fine

00:01:27.999 --> 00:01:28.009 
I don't know I got a a just make a fine

00:01:28.009 --> 00:01:30.309 
I don't know I got a a just make a fine
little<00:01:28.250> adjustments<00:01:28.969> to<00:01:29.179> about<00:01:29.600> my

00:05:01.730 --> 00:05:03.160 
that's already s 20 which is still 220 I
think<00:05:02.030> there's<00:05:02.240> all<00:05:02.450> types<00:05:02.690> of<00:05:02.810> difference

00:05:03.160 --> 00:05:03.170 
think there's all types of difference

00:05:03.170 --> 00:05:05.500
