00:00:02.659 --> 00:00:19.470
 hello everyone with you or bar and this 

00:00:05.850 --> 00:00:22.619
 freedom of speech you now ask why 

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:24.590
 I generally need all this many people 

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:28.260
 want to make your vlog 

00:00:24.590 --> 00:00:31.250
 well they are mistaken and most of them 

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:34.950
 want to make it high quality 

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:36.930
 but they are mistaken and think for 

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:40.500
 you need to spend too much money 

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:42.270
 i refute rumors to create my 

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:45.770
 home budget studio view not 

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:48.149
 be sure to spend too much money 

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:50.039
 because everything is necessary and expensive 

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:52.219
 equipment we make our own 

00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:52.219
 by hands 

00:00:56.350 --> 00:01:07.850
 as you see now vacuum films are coming 

00:00:59.570 --> 00:01:10.250
 in full swing repair and thanks to repair i 

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:13.010
 I can on the example of the studio he show how 

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:14.840
 everything can be done in this part of the program 

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:16.490
 we'll talk about these two wonderful 

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:19.540
 things like hromakey 

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:22.760
 and keying chromakey is a special fabric 

00:01:19.540 --> 00:01:24.950
 paper or fabric I looked a lot 

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:26.900
 video blog then which one is better 

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:28.360
 use in your studio will and 

00:01:26.900 --> 00:01:32.320
 understood one 

00:01:28.360 --> 00:01:35.660
 50 to 50 difference between them 

00:01:32.320 --> 00:01:38.360
 insignificant paper and easily breaks from 

00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:39.440
 Koneva it will cost more by 

00:01:38.360 --> 00:01:42.800
 the studio is now hanging 

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:45.070
 green paper hromakey 270 on 

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:48.310
 eleven 

00:01:45.070 --> 00:01:50.560
 to install our hromakey we take 4 

00:01:48.310 --> 00:01:53.320
 metal angle and two metal 

00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:55.150
 plates that can be bought cheaply in 

00:01:53.320 --> 00:01:57.520
 any hardware store now 

00:01:55.150 --> 00:01:58.300
 we fix the wall corner as shown 

00:01:57.520 --> 00:02:00.940
 on the picture 

00:01:58.300 --> 00:02:03.580
 later we connect 2 gold with the first bolts 

00:02:00.940 --> 00:02:05.560
 and screws the more they will be the stronger 

00:02:03.580 --> 00:02:08.229
 everything will hold now connect 

00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:11.200
 also a plate with a second corner and on 

00:02:08.229 --> 00:02:13.240
 plate dress hromakey for convenience 

00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:15.910
 the site to take someone to help as 

00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:23.430
 all this will not be very convenient for one person 

00:02:15.910 --> 00:02:26.470
 the thing here we have installed hromakey 

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:28.989
 the most important rule is it evenly 

00:02:26.470 --> 00:02:31.930
 light now we lit it very much 

00:02:28.989 --> 00:02:34.060
 sucks because of the lack of light in the future 

00:02:31.930 --> 00:02:36.489
 my do more and even show how 

00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:39.310
 make your own lightbox now 

00:02:36.489 --> 00:02:40.480
 we use chroma key green i 

00:02:39.310 --> 00:02:45.010
 I will explain why 

00:02:40.480 --> 00:02:47.230
 oh yes as you know hromakey 

00:02:45.010 --> 00:02:51.070
 film industry used two colors 

00:02:47.230 --> 00:02:53.350
 blue or green because these 

00:02:51.070 --> 00:02:57.130
 two shades least found on 

00:02:53.350 --> 00:02:58.930
 human body hromakey due 

00:02:57.130 --> 00:03:02.590
 hromakey we can use the effect 

00:02:58.930 --> 00:03:04.900
 keying which removes the background from the object 

00:03:02.590 --> 00:03:05.910
 which I will be in the following 

00:03:04.900 --> 00:03:09.010
 gears 

00:03:05.910 --> 00:03:11.590
 if we use white color then 

00:03:09.010 --> 00:03:14.650
 strongly swiss heavily lit colors 

00:03:11.590 --> 00:03:16.840
 will just disappear and if black then 

00:03:14.650 --> 00:03:19.630
 all black clothes and shadows on a person 

00:03:16.840 --> 00:03:21.220
 will disappear too subscribe to
