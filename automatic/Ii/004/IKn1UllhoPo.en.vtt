00:00:13.640 --> 00:00:13.650 
as the stand and venom are so it's got

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:16.460 
as the stand and venom are so it's got
all<00:00:14.160> the<00:00:14.580> crystal<00:00:15.179> clear<00:00:15.360> glass<00:00:15.599> and

all the crystal clear glass and
everything<00:00:16.560> else<00:00:16.949> but<00:00:17.820> it<00:00:18.449> has<00:00:18.750> the

00:00:19.040 --> 00:00:19.050 
everything else but it has the

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:20.900 
everything else but it has the
anti-reflective<00:00:19.470> coating<00:00:20.250> that<00:00:20.430> is<00:00:20.550> found<00:00:20.760> in

some of their other masks and it

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:25.220 
some of their other masks and it
basically<00:00:23.220> it's<00:00:23.460> there<00:00:23.699> to<00:00:23.910> improve<00:00:24.420> even

00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:25.230 
basically it's there to improve even

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:27.259 
basically it's there to improve even
further<00:00:25.470> the<00:00:26.039> light<00:00:26.220> transmittance<00:00:26.970> and

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:30.990 
color vibrance that the moss can give so

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:34.459

reverse teardrop design and it looks

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:53.630 
reverse teardrop design and it looks

and<00:00:58.260> obviously<00:00:58.920> moving<00:00:59.129> it<00:00:59.280> out<00:00:59.340> of<00:00:59.399> your

00:00:59.569 --> 00:00:59.579 
and obviously moving it out of your

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:03.920 
and obviously moving it out of your
field<00:00:59.789> of<00:00:59.879> view<00:01:01.820> crystal<00:01:02.820> clear<00:01:02.969> glass<00:01:03.270> so<00:01:03.899> you

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:03.930 
field of view crystal clear glass so you

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:06.219 
field of view crystal clear glass so you
don't<00:01:04.140> have<00:01:04.290> the<00:01:04.439> impurities<00:01:04.949> found<00:01:05.760> in<00:01:06.000> non

00:01:06.219 --> 00:01:06.229 
don't have the impurities found in non

00:01:06.229 --> 00:01:09.590 
don't have the impurities found in non
tempered<00:01:07.229> glass<00:01:07.820> obviously<00:01:08.820> improves<00:01:09.360> the

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:09.600 
tempered glass obviously improves the

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:12.410 
tempered glass obviously improves the
light<00:01:09.780> transmittance<00:01:10.500> stops<00:01:10.920> reflection<00:01:11.670> and

00:01:12.410 --> 00:01:12.420 
light transmittance stops reflection and

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:15.740 
light transmittance stops reflection and
improves<00:01:13.049> the<00:01:13.170> clarity<00:01:13.290> of<00:01:13.799> the<00:01:14.509> the<00:01:15.509> for<00:01:15.659> you

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:15.750 
improves the clarity of the the for you

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:18.350 
improves the clarity of the the for you
as<00:01:15.930> well<00:01:16.140> and<00:01:16.610> then<00:01:17.610> the<00:01:17.790> anti-reflective

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:18.360 
as well and then the anti-reflective

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:21.350 
as well and then the anti-reflective
coating<00:01:19.170> is<00:01:19.500> there<00:01:19.860> to<00:01:20.130> further<00:01:20.670> improve<00:01:21.030> the

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:21.360 
coating is there to further improve the

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:24.170 
coating is there to further improve the
light<00:01:21.540> transmittance<00:01:22.340> allows<00:01:23.340> the<00:01:23.580> light<00:01:23.759> in

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:24.180 
light transmittance allows the light in

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:26.600 
light transmittance allows the light in
without<00:01:24.659> it<00:01:24.810> being<00:01:25.020> reflected<00:01:25.590> away<00:01:25.830> so<00:01:26.490> it

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:26.610 
without it being reflected away so it

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:29.810 
without it being reflected away so it
improves<00:01:27.650> the<00:01:28.650> light<00:01:28.860> inside<00:01:29.400> the<00:01:29.460> mask

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:29.820 
improves the light inside the mask

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:32.679 
improves the light inside the mask
improves<00:01:30.390> the<00:01:30.600> color<00:01:31.110> vibrant<00:01:31.680> even<00:01:31.829> further

00:01:32.679 --> 00:01:32.689 
improves the color vibrant even further

00:01:32.689 --> 00:01:35.179 
improves the color vibrant even further
so<00:01:33.689> it<00:01:33.750> really<00:01:33.930> just<00:01:34.020> adds<00:01:34.290> an<00:01:34.560> extra<00:01:34.710> layer<00:01:35.009> of

00:01:35.179 --> 00:01:35.189 
so it really just adds an extra layer of

00:01:35.189 --> 00:01:38.499 
so it really just adds an extra layer of
the<00:01:35.280> clarity<00:01:35.729> to<00:01:36.240> the<00:01:36.329> mask

00:01:38.499 --> 00:01:38.509 
the clarity to the mask

00:01:38.509 --> 00:01:43.130 
the clarity to the mask
okay<00:01:39.509> sides<00:01:40.430> simple<00:01:41.600> buckle<00:01:42.600> adjustment

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:43.140 
okay sides simple buckle adjustment

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:44.840 
okay sides simple buckle adjustment
obviously<00:01:43.770> pulling<00:01:43.979> the<00:01:44.159> outside<00:01:44.490> will

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:44.850 
obviously pulling the outside will

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:45.499 
obviously pulling the outside will
tighten<00:01:45.240> it

00:01:45.499 --> 00:01:45.509 
tighten it

00:01:45.509 --> 00:01:47.840 
tighten it
but<00:01:45.990> you've<00:01:46.079> just<00:01:46.110> got<00:01:46.439> a<00:01:46.470> single<00:01:46.740> button<00:01:47.310> top

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:47.850 
but you've just got a single button top

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:50.600 
but you've just got a single button top
pushing<00:01:48.570> down<00:01:48.750> on<00:01:48.780> that<00:01:49.040> just<00:01:50.040> allows<00:01:50.340> it<00:01:50.579> to

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:50.610 
pushing down on that just allows it to

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:54.429 
pushing down on that just allows it to
pull<00:01:51.600> back<00:01:51.810> through<00:01:51.960> so<00:01:52.820> outside<00:01:53.820> to<00:01:54.000> tighten

00:01:54.429 --> 00:01:54.439 
pull back through so outside to tighten

00:01:54.439 --> 00:01:56.840 
pull back through so outside to tighten
push<00:01:55.439> the<00:01:55.530> button<00:01:55.799> pulling<00:01:56.159> inside<00:01:56.460> but<00:01:56.759> I'll

00:01:56.840 --> 00:01:56.850 
push the button pulling inside but I'll

00:01:56.850 --> 00:01:59.840 
push the button pulling inside but I'll
see<00:01:57.000> loosen<00:01:57.390> it<00:01:57.479> up<00:01:58.310> nice<00:01:59.310> and<00:01:59.549> simple

00:01:59.840 --> 00:01:59.850 
see loosen it up nice and simple

keep<00:02:14.390> the<00:02:14.510> strap<00:02:14.780> in<00:02:14.930> place<00:02:14.960> when<00:02:15.380> I<00:02:15.440> was<00:02:15.560> near

00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:15.710 
keep the strap in place when I was near

00:02:15.710 --> 00:02:19.330 
keep the strap in place when I was near
Darby<00:02:16.510> and<00:02:17.510> outside<00:02:17.840> obviously<00:02:18.350> exactly<00:02:19.250> the

00:02:19.330 --> 00:02:19.340 
Darby and outside obviously exactly the

00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:26.920 
Darby and outside obviously exactly the
same<00:02:21.340> insides<00:02:22.990> nice<00:02:23.990> white<00:02:24.850> skirt<00:02:25.850> loads<00:02:26.660> a

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:26.930 
same insides nice white skirt loads a

00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:29.710 
same insides nice white skirt loads a
ceiling<00:02:27.290> surface<00:02:27.820> around<00:02:28.820> the<00:02:28.970> outsides<00:02:29.420> and

00:02:29.710 --> 00:02:29.720 
ceiling surface around the outsides and

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:32.500 
ceiling surface around the outsides and
you<00:02:30.500> can<00:02:30.620> probably<00:02:30.890> just<00:02:31.580> see<00:02:31.940> as<00:02:32.030> I<00:02:32.060> move<00:02:32.330> it

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:32.510 
you can probably just see as I move it

00:02:32.510 --> 00:02:34.870 
you can probably just see as I move it
around<00:02:32.540> you<00:02:32.810> get<00:02:32.930> a<00:02:32.959> purple<00:02:33.680> tinge<00:02:33.980> to<00:02:34.340> the

00:02:34.870 --> 00:02:34.880 
around you get a purple tinge to the

00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:37.990 
around you get a purple tinge to the
lens<00:02:35.120> and<00:02:36.160> that<00:02:37.160> is<00:02:37.310> basically<00:02:37.580> the

00:02:37.990 --> 00:02:38.000 
lens and that is basically the

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:40.870 
lens and that is basically the
anti-reflective<00:02:38.390> coating<00:02:39.110> so<00:02:40.100> to<00:02:40.220> build<00:02:40.640> up<00:02:40.760> a

00:02:40.870 --> 00:02:40.880 
anti-reflective coating so to build up a

00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:43.630 
anti-reflective coating so to build up a
layer<00:02:41.060> of<00:02:41.330> the<00:02:41.660> the<00:02:42.470> coating<00:02:42.890> on<00:02:43.100> the<00:02:43.610> glass

00:02:43.630 --> 00:02:43.640 
layer of the the coating on the glass

00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:46.960 
layer of the the coating on the glass
and<00:02:44.330> just<00:02:45.010> it's<00:02:46.010> just<00:02:46.190> there<00:02:46.370> to<00:02:46.550> improve<00:02:46.910> the

00:02:46.960 --> 00:02:46.970 
and just it's just there to improve the

00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:49.510 
and just it's just there to improve the
light<00:02:47.570> transmittance<00:02:48.200> into<00:02:48.860> the<00:02:48.950> mask<00:02:49.160> itself

00:02:49.510 --> 00:02:49.520 
light transmittance into the mask itself

00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:54.150 
light transmittance into the mask itself
a<00:02:50.890> very<00:02:51.890> very<00:02:52.130> high<00:02:52.280> specification<00:02:53.180> mask

00:02:54.150 --> 00:02:54.160 
a very very high specification mask

00:02:54.160 --> 00:02:56.260 
a very very high specification mask
nothing<00:02:55.160> but<00:02:55.280> the<00:02:55.370> best<00:02:55.550> film<00:02:55.910> atomic

00:02:56.260 --> 00:02:56.270 
nothing but the best film atomic

00:02:56.270 --> 00:03:01.270 
nothing but the best film atomic
aquatics<00:02:56.780> that's<00:02:57.530> the<00:02:57.860> venom<00:02:58.400> a<00:02:58.520> or<00:02:58.820> C<00:02:59.030> mask
