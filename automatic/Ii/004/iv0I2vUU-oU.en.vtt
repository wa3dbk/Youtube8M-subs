00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:31.980 
one anyhow the part we have it's a

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:34.880 
one anyhow the part we have it's a
Porsche<00:00:32.340> part<00:00:33.020> you<00:00:34.020> can<00:00:34.140> see<00:00:34.350> it's<00:00:34.500> you<00:00:34.770> know

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:34.890 
Porsche part you can see it's you know

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:36.440 
Porsche part you can see it's you know
where<00:00:35.190> it's<00:00:35.309> going<00:00:35.460> to<00:00:35.520> trap<00:00:35.790> their<00:00:36.000> fish<00:00:36.270> if

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:36.450 
where it's going to trap their fish if

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:39.020 
where it's going to trap their fish if
you<00:00:36.570> feed<00:00:36.780> it<00:00:36.930> in<00:00:37.110> the<00:00:37.800> main<00:00:38.070> part<00:00:38.670> that's

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:39.030 
you feed it in the main part that's

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:42.470 
you feed it in the main part that's
going<00:00:39.210> to<00:00:39.270> be<00:00:39.390> showing<00:00:39.930> is<00:00:40.640> this<00:00:41.640> waffle<00:00:42.210> part

00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:42.480 
going to be showing is this waffle part

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:45.170 
going to be showing is this waffle part
now<00:00:42.690> as<00:00:42.960> you<00:00:43.590> can<00:00:43.739> see<00:00:43.800> you're<00:00:44.700> gonna<00:00:44.820> trap

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:45.180 
now as you can see you're gonna trap

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:46.910 
now as you can see you're gonna trap
there<00:00:45.420> there's<00:00:45.719> really<00:00:45.960> just<00:00:46.110> no<00:00:46.440> way<00:00:46.890> around

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:46.920 
there there's really just no way around

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:52.760 
there there's really just no way around
this<00:00:48.620> so<00:00:49.620> I'm<00:00:49.860> gonna<00:00:51.260> attempt<00:00:52.260> to<00:00:52.320> roll<00:00:52.620> this

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:52.770 
this so I'm gonna attempt to roll this

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:55.670 
this so I'm gonna attempt to roll this
into<00:00:53.010> the<00:00:53.190> water<00:00:53.430> backwards<00:00:54.180> back<00:00:55.050> feeding<00:00:55.530> if

00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:55.680 
into the water backwards back feeding if

00:00:55.680 --> 00:01:01.700 
into the water backwards back feeding if
you<00:00:55.770> will<00:00:59.629> if<00:01:00.629> it<00:01:00.780> doesn't<00:01:01.140> work<00:01:01.289> I'm<00:01:01.530> just

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:01.710 
you will if it doesn't work I'm just

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:04.090 
you will if it doesn't work I'm just
gonna<00:01:01.829> eat<00:01:02.250> it<00:01:02.460> and<00:01:02.730> try<00:01:02.910> something<00:01:03.210> else<00:01:03.480> but

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:12.750 
not to make this sound more elegant than

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:14.450 
not to make this sound more elegant than
it<00:01:13.020> is<00:01:13.170> but<00:01:13.409> sometimes<00:01:13.860> kind<00:01:14.220> of<00:01:14.310> like<00:01:14.430> a

00:01:31.429 --> 00:01:31.439 
problems some guys are more gifted than

00:01:31.439 --> 00:01:33.920 
problems some guys are more gifted than
just<00:01:31.770> take<00:01:31.920> it<00:01:32.070> throwing<00:01:32.310> the<00:01:32.460> tank<00:01:32.700> I<00:01:32.850> am<00:01:33.570> NOT
