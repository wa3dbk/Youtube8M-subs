00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:48.120 

yeah<00:00:46.870> I<00:00:46.900> think<00:00:47.050> a<00:00:47.170> track<00:00:47.410> walk<00:00:47.650> is<00:00:47.800> one<00:00:47.950> of<00:00:48.070> the

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:48.130 
yeah I think a track walk is one of the

00:00:48.130 --> 00:00:49.530 
yeah I think a track walk is one of the
most<00:00:48.340> important<00:00:48.820> parts<00:00:49.030> of<00:00:49.090> the<00:00:49.180> weekend

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:33.550 
on the internet right yeah definitely is

00:01:33.550 --> 00:01:35.760 
on the internet right yeah definitely is
important<00:01:34.030> to<00:01:34.150> kind<00:01:34.330> of<00:01:34.480> get<00:01:34.660> your<00:01:35.140> line<00:01:35.500> that

00:01:35.760 --> 00:01:35.770 
important to kind of get your line that

00:01:35.770 --> 00:01:38.720 
important to kind of get your line that
you<00:01:35.890> want<00:01:36.130> to<00:01:36.190> ride<00:01:36.400> but<00:01:36.990> at<00:01:37.990> the<00:01:38.140> same<00:01:38.350> time

00:01:38.720 --> 00:01:38.730 
you want to ride but at the same time

00:01:38.730 --> 00:01:42.750 
you want to ride but at the same time
when<00:01:39.730> you<00:01:40.240> know<00:01:40.360> you<00:01:40.420> have<00:01:41.310> 100<00:01:42.310> other<00:01:42.670> people

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:42.760 
when you know you have 100 other people

00:01:42.760 --> 00:01:45.960 
when you know you have 100 other people
riding<00:01:43.360> it<00:01:43.450> before<00:01:43.780> you<00:01:43.830> different<00:01:44.830> lines<00:01:45.070> cut

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:45.970 
riding it before you different lines cut

00:01:45.970 --> 00:01:49.560 
riding it before you different lines cut
in<00:01:46.119> and<00:01:46.330> different<00:01:47.020> lines<00:01:47.170> shot<00:01:47.619> so<00:01:48.330> it's<00:01:49.330> good

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:49.570 
in and different lines shot so it's good

00:01:49.570 --> 00:01:52.950 
in and different lines shot so it's good
to<00:01:49.600> get<00:01:49.869> a<00:01:49.930> base<00:01:50.770> on<00:01:51.300> what<00:01:52.300> line<00:01:52.479> you<00:01:52.510> want<00:01:52.869> to

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:52.960 
to get a base on what line you want to

00:01:52.960 --> 00:01:55.200 
to get a base on what line you want to
ride<00:01:53.110> but<00:01:53.440> I<00:01:53.680> think<00:01:54.040> by<00:01:54.550> the<00:01:54.610> end<00:01:54.700> of<00:01:54.880> the<00:01:55.000> day

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:55.210 
ride but I think by the end of the day

00:01:55.210 --> 00:01:56.820 
ride but I think by the end of the day
you<00:01:55.869> know<00:01:55.990> you<00:01:56.050> kind<00:01:56.290> of<00:01:56.350> want<00:01:56.500> to<00:01:56.560> walk<00:01:56.680> it

00:01:56.820 --> 00:01:56.830 
you know you kind of want to walk it

00:01:56.830 --> 00:01:59.460 
you know you kind of want to walk it
again<00:01:57.100> and<00:01:57.340> and<00:01:57.580> see<00:01:58.479> if<00:01:58.570> these<00:01:58.720> other<00:01:59.170> lines

00:01:59.460 --> 00:01:59.470 
again and and see if these other lines

00:01:59.470 --> 00:02:02.790 
again and and see if these other lines
that<00:01:59.650> I<00:01:59.680> opened<00:02:00.009> up<00:02:00.070> so<00:02:00.340> it's<00:02:01.330> best<00:02:02.140> to<00:02:02.320> ride<00:02:02.560> at

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:02.800 
that I opened up so it's best to ride at

00:02:02.800 --> 00:02:12.000 
that I opened up so it's best to ride at
first<00:02:03.070> and<00:02:03.340> see<00:02:04.090> how<00:02:04.119> you<00:02:04.420> write<00:02:04.630> lines<00:02:04.960> right

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:12.010 

00:02:12.010 --> 00:02:15.330 

I<00:02:12.870> think<00:02:13.870> the<00:02:13.959> best<00:02:14.170> way<00:02:14.260> to<00:02:14.409> race<00:02:14.650> is<00:02:14.860> to<00:02:15.040> carry

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:15.340 
I think the best way to race is to carry

00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:17.069 
I think the best way to race is to carry
momentum<00:02:15.849> through<00:02:16.329> the<00:02:16.390> whole<00:02:16.540> track<00:02:16.840> and

00:02:17.069 --> 00:02:17.079 
momentum through the whole track and

00:02:17.079 --> 00:02:18.449 
momentum through the whole track and
have<00:02:17.140> a<00:02:17.200> high<00:02:17.379> average<00:02:17.530> speed<00:02:18.010> so<00:02:18.280> we're<00:02:18.430> just

00:02:18.449 --> 00:02:18.459 
have a high average speed so we're just

00:02:18.459 --> 00:02:20.039 
have a high average speed so we're just
looking<00:02:18.849> for<00:02:18.879> places<00:02:19.269> where<00:02:19.420> we<00:02:19.629> can<00:02:19.780> carry

00:02:20.039 --> 00:02:20.049 
looking for places where we can carry

00:02:20.049 --> 00:02:22.289 
looking for places where we can carry
more<00:02:20.290> speed<00:02:20.500> and<00:02:20.860> just<00:02:21.700> make<00:02:21.849> the<00:02:21.939> whole<00:02:21.970> track

00:02:22.289 --> 00:02:22.299 
more speed and just make the whole track

00:02:22.299 --> 00:02:24.509 
more speed and just make the whole track
flow<00:02:22.629> together<00:02:22.810> but<00:02:23.230> yeah<00:02:23.650> this<00:02:23.769> kind<00:02:24.400> of

00:02:24.509 --> 00:02:24.519 
flow together but yeah this kind of

00:02:24.519 --> 00:02:26.640 
flow together but yeah this kind of
gives<00:02:24.879> you<00:02:24.939> a<00:02:25.030> basic<00:02:25.390> knowledge<00:02:25.750> of<00:02:26.319> what

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:26.650 
gives you a basic knowledge of what

00:02:26.650 --> 00:02:28.979 
gives you a basic knowledge of what
you're<00:02:26.799> going<00:02:27.010> into<00:02:27.220> for<00:02:28.120> attract<00:02:28.450> walks<00:02:28.690> I

00:02:28.979 --> 00:02:28.989 
you're going into for attract walks I

00:02:28.989 --> 00:02:33.240 
you're going into for attract walks I
think<00:02:29.769> it's<00:02:29.950> very<00:02:30.040> important<00:02:30.760> to<00:02:32.040> take<00:02:33.040> your

00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:33.250 
think it's very important to take your

00:02:33.250 --> 00:02:34.309 
think it's very important to take your
time<00:02:33.459> and

00:02:34.309 --> 00:02:34.319 
time and

00:02:34.319 --> 00:02:36.860 
time and
definitely<00:02:35.249> look<00:02:35.400> at<00:02:35.549> with<00:02:36.030> a<00:02:36.060> different

00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:36.870 
definitely look at with a different

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:40.390 
definitely look at with a different
options

00:02:40.390 --> 00:02:40.400 

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:42.309 

when<00:02:41.329> you<00:02:41.450> get<00:02:41.599> a<00:02:41.629> couple<00:02:41.959> of<00:02:42.019> people's

00:02:42.309 --> 00:02:42.319 
when you get a couple of people's

00:02:42.319 --> 00:02:43.899 
when you get a couple of people's
opinion<00:02:42.709> on<00:02:42.829> it<00:02:42.980> it's<00:02:43.129> much<00:02:43.310> better<00:02:43.489> than<00:02:43.700> just

00:02:43.899 --> 00:02:43.909 
opinion on it it's much better than just

00:02:43.909 --> 00:02:45.490 
opinion on it it's much better than just
having<00:02:44.060> one<00:02:44.329> and<00:02:44.569> that<00:02:44.720> kind<00:02:45.019> of<00:02:45.049> takes<00:02:45.290> some

00:02:45.490 --> 00:02:45.500 
having one and that kind of takes some

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:47.979 
having one and that kind of takes some
doubt<00:02:46.040> and<00:02:46.250> question<00:02:46.430> out<00:02:46.819> if<00:02:47.480> I<00:02:47.689> walk<00:02:47.870> the

00:02:47.979 --> 00:02:47.989 
doubt and question out if I walk the

00:02:47.989 --> 00:02:49.780 
doubt and question out if I walk the
track<00:02:48.170> by<00:02:48.349> myself<00:02:48.769> I<00:02:48.950> can<00:02:49.129> have<00:02:49.250> a<00:02:49.280> good<00:02:49.459> idea

00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:49.790 
track by myself I can have a good idea

00:02:49.790 --> 00:02:51.550 
track by myself I can have a good idea
but<00:02:50.060> if<00:02:50.269> I<00:02:50.450> have<00:02:50.540> two<00:02:50.720> people<00:02:50.900> agree<00:02:51.230> with<00:02:51.409> me

00:02:51.550 --> 00:02:51.560 
but if I have two people agree with me

00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:54.009 
but if I have two people agree with me
then<00:02:51.920> it<00:02:52.400> kind<00:02:52.970> of<00:02:53.000> confirms<00:02:53.450> what<00:02:53.689> i<00:02:53.720> thought

00:02:54.009 --> 00:02:54.019 
then it kind of confirms what i thought

00:02:54.019 --> 00:02:55.569 
then it kind of confirms what i thought
it<00:02:54.049> just<00:02:54.439> takes<00:02:54.950> a<00:02:55.069> little<00:02:55.220> bit<00:02:55.370> of<00:02:55.430> the

00:02:55.569 --> 00:02:55.579 
it just takes a little bit of the

00:02:55.579 --> 00:02:58.420 
it just takes a little bit of the
pressure<00:02:55.700> off<00:02:55.939> of<00:02:56.209> the<00:02:56.329> rider

00:02:58.420 --> 00:02:58.430 
pressure off of the rider

00:02:58.430 --> 00:03:00.489 
pressure off of the rider
