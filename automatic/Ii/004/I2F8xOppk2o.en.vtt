00:03:12.250 --> 00:03:12.260 
use it so just transfer some of them to

00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:15.869 
use it so just transfer some of them to
the<00:03:12.709> center<00:03:13.010> of<00:03:13.069> the<00:03:13.129> chicken<00:03:13.629> just<00:03:14.629> like<00:03:14.749> that

00:03:15.869 --> 00:03:15.879 
the center of the chicken just like that

00:03:15.879 --> 00:03:17.769 
the center of the chicken just like that
don't<00:03:16.879> put<00:03:17.060> too<00:03:17.090> many<00:03:17.329> in<00:03:17.420> there<00:03:17.480> otherwise

00:03:17.769 --> 00:03:17.779 
don't put too many in there otherwise

00:03:17.779 --> 00:03:21.089 
don't put too many in there otherwise
you<00:03:17.930> won't<00:03:17.989> be<00:03:18.079> able<00:03:18.139> to<00:03:18.260> roll<00:03:18.469> it<00:03:18.650> just<00:03:19.519> salt

00:03:21.089 --> 00:03:21.099 
you won't be able to roll it just salt

00:03:21.099 --> 00:03:23.979 
you won't be able to roll it just salt
so<00:03:22.099> that's<00:03:22.249> gonna<00:03:22.370> probably<00:03:22.549> need<00:03:22.730> about<00:03:22.989> five

00:03:23.979 --> 00:03:23.989 
so that's gonna probably need about five

00:03:23.989 --> 00:03:24.729 
so that's gonna probably need about five
minutes<00:03:24.230> longer

00:03:24.729 --> 00:03:24.739 
minutes longer

00:03:24.739 --> 00:03:25.720

meat glad wrap first step oil second

00:04:17.930 --> 00:04:21.729 
meat glad wrap first step oil second
step<00:04:18.250> so<00:04:19.250> you<00:04:19.310> want<00:04:19.489> it<00:04:19.579> tight<00:04:20.169> just<00:04:21.169> fold<00:04:21.470> each

step so you want it tight just fold each
end<00:04:21.980> up

00:04:32.939 --> 00:04:32.949 

00:04:32.949 --> 00:04:37.239 

for<00:04:33.949> that<00:04:34.339> so<00:04:34.999> that's<00:04:35.179> your<00:04:35.689> roulade<00:04:36.099> now<00:04:37.099> it

00:04:37.239 --> 00:04:37.249 
for that so that's your roulade now it

00:04:37.249 --> 00:04:39.969 
for that so that's your roulade now it
all<00:04:37.369> it<00:04:37.459> takes<00:04:37.669> it<00:04:37.789> to<00:04:37.909> poach<00:04:38.119> it<00:04:38.330> Kimber<00:04:38.979> it's

00:04:39.969 --> 00:04:39.979 
all it takes it to poach it Kimber it's

00:04:39.979 --> 00:04:41.139 
all it takes it to poach it Kimber it's
all<00:04:40.069> ready<00:04:40.279> to<00:04:40.339> go<00:04:40.459> it's<00:04:40.580> perfect

00:04:41.139 --> 00:04:41.149 
all ready to go it's perfect

00:04:41.149 --> 00:04:43.359 
all ready to go it's perfect
so<00:04:41.389> we're<00:04:41.539> slow<00:04:41.989> poaching<00:04:42.589> our<00:04:43.009> chicken

00:04:43.359 --> 00:04:43.369 
so we're slow poaching our chicken

00:04:43.369 --> 00:04:45.249 
so we're slow poaching our chicken
roulade<00:04:43.489> and<00:04:43.939> we're<00:04:44.419> starting<00:04:44.839> off<00:04:44.929> in<00:04:45.079> cold

00:04:45.249 --> 00:04:45.259 
roulade and we're starting off in cold

00:04:45.259 --> 00:04:47.679 
roulade and we're starting off in cold
water<00:04:45.499> so<00:04:45.919> the<00:04:46.099> idea<00:04:46.519> is<00:04:46.759> as<00:04:47.029> the<00:04:47.299> waters<00:04:47.569> going

00:04:47.679 --> 00:04:47.689 
water so the idea is as the waters going

00:04:47.689 --> 00:04:49.059 
water so the idea is as the waters going
to<00:04:47.779> come<00:04:47.929> up<00:04:48.019> to<00:04:48.049> heat<00:04:48.439> the<00:04:48.679> chicken<00:04:48.919> is<00:04:48.979> going

00:04:49.059 --> 00:04:49.069 
to come up to heat the chicken is going

00:04:49.069 --> 00:04:51.159 
to come up to heat the chicken is going
to<00:04:49.159> come<00:04:49.309> to<00:04:49.429> heat<00:04:49.579> bring<00:04:50.209> the<00:04:50.299> water<00:04:50.509> up<00:04:50.809> to

00:04:51.159 --> 00:04:51.169 
to come to heat bring the water up to

00:04:51.169 --> 00:04:52.929 
to come to heat bring the water up to
where<00:04:51.559> it's<00:04:51.679> simmering<00:04:52.099> ok<00:04:52.369> so<00:04:52.429> just<00:04:52.579> little

00:04:52.929 --> 00:04:52.939 
where it's simmering ok so just little

00:04:52.939 --> 00:04:55.059 
where it's simmering ok so just little
bubbles<00:04:53.360> little<00:04:53.689> bit<00:04:53.869> of<00:04:53.959> steam<00:04:54.169> and<00:04:54.409> then

00:04:55.059 --> 00:04:55.069 
bubbles little bit of steam and then

00:04:55.069 --> 00:04:59.279 
bubbles little bit of steam and then
turn<00:04:55.969> it<00:04:56.119> off<00:04:56.239> we'll<00:04:56.599> throw<00:04:56.779> a<00:04:56.809> lid<00:04:57.019> on<00:04:57.049> it<00:04:57.699> I
