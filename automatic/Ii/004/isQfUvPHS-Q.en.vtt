I<00:00:48.149> don't<00:00:48.390> think<00:00:48.570> this<00:00:48.690> video<00:00:48.930> quite<00:00:49.110> does<00:00:49.320> it

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:49.440 
I don't think this video quite does it

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:50.750 
I don't think this video quite does it
justice<00:00:49.770> because<00:00:49.980> it<00:00:50.129> does<00:00:50.280> really<00:00:50.610> look

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:50.760 
justice because it does really look

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:52.910 
justice because it does really look
really<00:00:50.969> good<00:00:51.090> it's<00:00:51.500> obviously<00:00:52.500> if<00:00:52.649> you<00:00:52.710> played

00:01:16.429 --> 00:01:16.439 
about it if you're thinking about

00:01:16.439 --> 00:01:18.289

00:01:18.289 --> 00:01:18.299 
getting this it looks like the other

00:01:18.299 --> 00:01:19.700 
getting this it looks like the other
stuff<00:01:18.570> on<00:01:18.659> the<00:01:18.750> thing<00:01:18.869> is<00:01:18.960> super<00:01:19.110> detailed<00:01:19.560> but

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:19.710 
stuff on the thing is super detailed but

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:21.260

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:23.280 
it looks slightly bland for some reason

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:24.230 
it looks slightly bland for some reason
compared<00:01:23.610> to<00:01:23.670> everything<00:01:23.850> else

00:01:24.230 --> 00:01:24.240 
compared to everything else

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:26.929 
compared to everything else
the<00:01:24.509> little<00:01:25.080> other<00:01:25.259> thing<00:01:25.530> the<00:01:25.979> EBR<00:01:26.490> if<00:01:26.790> you

00:01:32.569 --> 00:01:32.579 
kind of was and I thought oh I'll just

00:01:32.579 --> 00:01:33.830 
kind of was and I thought oh I'll just
bend<00:01:32.820> it<00:01:32.880> back<00:01:33.060> a<00:01:33.090> little<00:01:33.180> bit<00:01:33.420> be<00:01:33.810> careful

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:33.840 
bend it back a little bit be careful

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:37.630 
bend it back a little bit be careful
that<00:01:34.320> thing<00:01:34.500> breaks<00:01:34.740> off<00:01:34.920> real<00:01:35.189> easy<00:01:36.229> trust<00:01:37.229> me

00:01:37.630 --> 00:01:37.640 
that thing breaks off real easy trust me

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:39.410 
that thing breaks off real easy trust me
I'm<00:01:38.640> gonna<00:01:38.729> just<00:01:38.939> super<00:01:39.180> glue<00:01:39.299> it<00:01:39.390> back

00:01:39.410 --> 00:01:39.420 
I'm gonna just super glue it back

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:41.690 
I'm gonna just super glue it back
because<00:01:39.720> of<00:01:40.200> the<00:01:40.290> way<00:01:40.409> it<00:01:40.560> broke<00:01:41.009> and<00:01:41.250> you<00:01:41.549> can

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:41.700 
because of the way it broke and you can

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:42.770 
because of the way it broke and you can
I<00:01:41.909> can<00:01:42.060> superglue<00:01:42.420> it<00:01:42.479> without<00:01:42.630> it<00:01:42.750> being

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:42.780 
I can superglue it without it being

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:44.270 
I can superglue it without it being
pretty<00:01:43.020> obviously<00:01:43.409> just<00:01:43.590> a<00:01:43.799> little<00:01:44.130> note

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:44.280 
pretty obviously just a little note

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:46.700 
pretty obviously just a little note
that's<00:01:44.520> really<00:01:44.909> fragile<00:01:45.119> and<00:01:45.560> though<00:01:46.560> it

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:46.710 
that's really fragile and though it

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:48.170 
that's really fragile and though it
looks<00:01:46.890> and<00:01:47.070> feels<00:01:47.189> bendable<00:01:47.670> is<00:01:47.759> not<00:01:47.939> bendable

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:48.180 
looks and feels bendable is not bendable

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:50.810 
looks and feels bendable is not bendable
