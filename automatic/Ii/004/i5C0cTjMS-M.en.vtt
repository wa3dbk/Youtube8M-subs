00:00:26.689 --> 00:00:26.699 
a very solid kill one that I was not

00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:28.279 
a very solid kill one that I was not
expecting<00:00:26.970> but<00:00:27.300> that<00:00:27.390> overcharge<00:00:27.599> paying<00:00:28.109> for

00:00:28.279 --> 00:00:28.289 
expecting but that overcharge paying for

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:29.599 
expecting but that overcharge paying for
itself<00:00:28.380> it's<00:00:28.650> just<00:00:28.949> level<00:00:29.250> one<00:00:29.369> but<00:00:29.519> it's

00:00:29.599 --> 00:00:29.609 
itself it's just level one but it's

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:31.550 
itself it's just level one but it's
enough<00:00:29.849> to<00:00:30.449> help<00:00:30.570> them<00:00:30.779> out<00:00:30.900> and<00:00:31.050> secure<00:00:31.439> it

aa ke who has tether up in 60 could

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:49.700 
aa ke who has tether up in 60 could
probably<00:00:48.030> relocate<00:00:48.539> out<00:00:48.690> but<00:00:48.870> yet<00:00:49.050> he<00:00:49.590> is

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:49.710 
probably relocate out but yet he is

probably relocate out but yet he is
gonna<00:00:49.890> relocate<00:00:50.190> out<00:00:50.550> he'll<00:00:51.329> make<00:00:51.510> it<00:00:51.539> away

00:00:51.889 --> 00:00:51.899 
gonna relocate out he'll make it away

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:53.689 
gonna relocate out he'll make it away
they'll<00:00:52.620> try<00:00:52.770> to<00:00:52.829> get<00:00:53.010> into<00:00:53.160> a<00:00:53.190> position<00:00:53.370> to

00:00:53.689 --> 00:00:53.699 
they'll try to get into a position to

00:00:53.699 --> 00:00:55.490 
they'll try to get into a position to
fight<00:00:53.910> his<00:00:54.090> eyes<00:00:54.239> actually<00:00:54.600> harassing<00:00:55.320> and

00:00:55.490 --> 00:00:55.500 
fight his eyes actually harassing and

fight his eyes actually harassing and
now<00:00:56.039> even<00:00:56.370> get<00:00:56.460> to<00:00:56.550> last<00:00:56.760> so<00:00:56.940> they<00:00:57.030> might<00:00:57.149> even

00:00:57.290 --> 00:00:57.300 
now even get to last so they might even

00:00:57.300 --> 00:00:59.869 
now even get to last so they might even
gets<00:00:57.480> to<00:00:57.539> out<00:00:57.750> of<00:00:57.840> this<00:00:58.190> they<00:00:59.190> just<00:00:59.460> run<00:00:59.579> away<00:00:59.730> I

00:00:59.869 --> 00:00:59.879 
gets to out of this they just run away I

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:01.819 
gets to out of this they just run away I
think<00:00:59.969> maybe<00:01:00.329> mr.<00:01:00.960> Bob<00:01:01.109> he<00:01:01.230> actually<00:01:01.260> he<00:01:01.739> was

00:01:01.819 --> 00:01:01.829 
think maybe mr. Bob he actually he was

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:03.139 
think maybe mr. Bob he actually he was
winning<00:01:02.010> I<00:01:02.129> think<00:01:02.340> for<00:01:02.460> his<00:01:02.550> tether<00:01:02.699> and<00:01:02.969> he's

00:01:03.139 --> 00:01:03.149 
winning I think for his tether and he's

00:01:03.149 --> 00:01:04.520 
winning I think for his tether and he's
gonna<00:01:03.329> try<00:01:03.539> to<00:01:03.570> cover<00:01:03.750> two<00:01:03.930> equal<00:01:04.229> but<00:01:04.320> he<00:01:04.379> gets

00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:04.530 
gonna try to cover two equal but he gets

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:07.039 
gonna try to cover two equal but he gets
telekinesis<00:01:05.129> so<00:01:05.309> fast<00:01:05.610> that<00:01:05.790> he<00:01:06.659> gets<00:01:06.840> blown

00:01:07.039 --> 00:01:07.049 
telekinesis so fast that he gets blown

00:01:07.049 --> 00:01:09.140 
telekinesis so fast that he gets blown
up<00:01:07.080> it<00:01:07.470> was<00:01:07.560> a<00:01:07.590> good<00:01:07.710> try<00:01:07.950> actually<00:01:08.700> avoids<00:01:08.970> the

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:09.150 
up it was a good try actually avoids the

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:11.570 
up it was a good try actually avoids the
Avalanche<00:01:09.450> as<00:01:09.570> well<00:01:10.010> so<00:01:11.010> two<00:01:11.070> quick<00:01:11.369> kills

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:11.580

little bit more I just I the only thing
I<00:06:19.879> wasn't<00:06:20.060> offended<00:06:20.270> was<00:06:20.479> this<00:06:20.599> clockwork

00:06:21.040 --> 00:06:21.050 
I wasn't offended was this clockwork

00:06:21.050 --> 00:06:22.959 
I wasn't offended was this clockwork
pick<00:06:21.259> it's<00:06:21.979> cuz<00:06:22.129> if<00:06:22.219> you<00:06:22.250> look<00:06:22.430> at<00:06:22.520> the<00:06:22.550> lineups

00:06:22.959 --> 00:06:22.969 
pick it's cuz if you look at the lineups

00:06:22.969 --> 00:06:25.140 
pick it's cuz if you look at the lineups
of<00:06:23.120> team<00:06:23.300> secret<00:06:23.719> i<00:06:23.810> just<00:06:24.229> don't<00:06:24.379> think

00:06:25.140 --> 00:06:25.150 
of team secret i just don't think

00:06:25.150 --> 00:06:26.800 
of team secret i just don't think
obviously<00:06:26.150> you're<00:06:26.300> more<00:06:26.479> of<00:06:26.539> a<00:06:26.599> team<00:06:26.779> player

00:06:26.800 --> 00:06:26.810 
obviously you're more of a team player

00:06:26.810 --> 00:06:28.360 
obviously you're more of a team player
on<00:06:27.259> the<00:06:27.349> clockwork<00:06:27.680> and<00:06:27.770> you<00:06:27.860> want<00:06:28.009> to<00:06:28.099> seven

00:06:28.360 --> 00:06:28.370 
on the clockwork and you want to seven

00:06:28.370 --> 00:06:30.249 
on the clockwork and you want to seven
thing<00:06:28.550> set<00:06:28.849> things<00:06:29.029> up<00:06:29.210> by<00:06:29.449> cogging<00:06:29.900> someone

00:06:30.249 --> 00:06:30.259 
thing set things up by cogging someone

00:06:30.259 --> 00:06:31.600 
thing set things up by cogging someone
and<00:06:30.379> then<00:06:30.469> if<00:06:30.560> you<00:06:30.650> die<00:06:30.830> it's<00:06:31.039> it's<00:06:31.310> no<00:06:31.460> big

00:06:31.600 --> 00:06:31.610 
and then if you die it's it's no big

00:06:31.610 --> 00:06:33.850 
and then if you die it's it's no big
deal<00:06:31.639> but<00:06:32.060> I<00:06:32.270> still<00:06:32.810> think<00:06:33.050> lineups<00:06:33.650> where

00:06:33.850 --> 00:06:33.860 
deal but I still think lineups where

00:06:33.860 --> 00:06:35.769 
deal but I still think lineups where
clockwork<00:06:34.250> can<00:06:34.370> get<00:06:34.490> solo<00:06:34.789> pickoffs<00:06:35.389> and<00:06:35.569> like

00:06:35.769 --> 00:06:35.779 
clockwork can get solo pickoffs and like

00:06:35.779 --> 00:06:38.589 
clockwork can get solo pickoffs and like
okay
