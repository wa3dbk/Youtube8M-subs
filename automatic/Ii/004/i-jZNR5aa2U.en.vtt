00:00:46.830 --> 00:00:46.840 
they're ready to go into pots but you

00:00:46.840 --> 00:00:48.210 
they're ready to go into pots but you
can<00:00:46.960> also<00:00:47.110> see<00:00:47.380> we<00:00:47.560> did<00:00:47.680> these<00:00:47.800> in<00:00:47.980> the<00:00:48.040> kitchen

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:48.220

00:00:50.770 --> 00:00:53.970 
there's a lot of wilt and and white
spots<00:00:51.329> compared<00:00:52.329> to<00:00:52.390> these<00:00:52.510> that<00:00:52.810> word<00:00:52.980> kept

00:00:53.970 --> 00:00:53.980 
spots compared to these that word kept

00:00:53.980 --> 00:00:56.880 
spots compared to these that word kept
outside<00:00:54.190> in<00:00:54.760> in<00:00:55.570> direct<00:00:55.900> sunlight<00:00:56.140> no

00:00:56.880 --> 00:00:56.890 
outside in in direct sunlight no

00:00:56.890 --> 00:00:59.460 
outside in in direct sunlight no
sunlight<00:00:57.190> hitting<00:00:57.670> them<00:00:57.910> and<00:00:58.440> they're<00:00:59.440> doing

00:00:59.460 --> 00:00:59.470 
sunlight hitting them and they're doing

00:00:59.470 --> 00:01:00.930 
sunlight hitting them and they're doing
a<00:00:59.739> lot<00:00:59.890> better<00:01:00.100> than<00:01:00.220> this<00:01:00.460> one<00:01:00.670> that<00:01:00.700> was

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:00.940 
a lot better than this one that was

00:01:00.940 --> 00:01:02.610 
a lot better than this one that was
indoors<00:01:01.300> even<00:01:01.510> though<00:01:01.870> this<00:01:02.020> is<00:01:02.170> going<00:01:02.410> to<00:01:02.530> be

00:01:02.610 --> 00:01:02.620 
indoors even though this is going to be

00:01:02.620 --> 00:01:05.550 
indoors even though this is going to be
fine<00:01:02.890> I<00:01:02.920> think<00:01:03.340> we'll<00:01:03.489> see<00:01:03.700> and<00:01:04.500> compared<00:01:05.500> to

00:01:05.550 --> 00:01:05.560 
fine I think we'll see and compared to

00:01:05.560 --> 00:01:07.080 
fine I think we'll see and compared to
these<00:01:05.680> which<00:01:06.009> we're<00:01:06.189> done<00:01:06.370> right<00:01:06.670> next<00:01:07.000> to

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:07.090 
these which we're done right next to

00:01:07.090 --> 00:01:08.880 
these which we're done right next to
them<00:01:07.210> outside<00:01:07.420> here<00:01:08.140> in<00:01:08.170> this<00:01:08.380> spot<00:01:08.620> where

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:08.890 
them outside here in this spot where

00:01:08.890 --> 00:01:10.320 
them outside here in this spot where
there's<00:01:09.040> no<00:01:09.190> direct<00:01:09.550> sunlight<00:01:09.610> hitting<00:01:10.120> them

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:10.330 
there's no direct sunlight hitting them

00:01:10.330 --> 00:01:11.850 
there's no direct sunlight hitting them
and<00:01:10.510> these<00:01:10.840> are<00:01:10.900> doing<00:01:11.200> the<00:01:11.290> best<00:01:11.500> in<00:01:11.710> my

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:11.860 
and these are doing the best in my

00:01:11.860 --> 00:01:13.710
