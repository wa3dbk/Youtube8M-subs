and you know we're talking about low
testosterone<00:00:02.010> I'm<00:00:02.879> gonna<00:00:03.060> use<00:00:03.300> that<00:00:03.600> as<00:00:03.870> a

00:00:03.889 --> 00:00:03.899 
testosterone I'm gonna use that as a

00:00:03.899 --> 00:00:06.460 
testosterone I'm gonna use that as a
segue<00:00:04.290> to<00:00:04.830> a<00:00:05.160> condition<00:00:05.759> that<00:00:05.879> can<00:00:06.029> affect

00:00:06.460 --> 00:00:06.470 
segue to a condition that can affect

00:00:06.470 --> 00:00:09.110 
segue to a condition that can affect
males<00:00:07.470> and<00:00:07.770> recently<00:00:08.189> a<00:00:08.309> study<00:00:08.460> came<00:00:09.090> out

00:00:09.110 --> 00:00:09.120 
males and recently a study came out

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:12.320 
males and recently a study came out
which<00:00:09.990> said<00:00:10.349> that<00:00:10.380> varicocele<00:00:11.190> zackin<00:00:12.000> dition

00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:12.330 
which said that varicocele zackin dition

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:15.049 
which said that varicocele zackin dition
that<00:00:12.509> in<00:00:12.599> fact<00:00:12.840> exists<00:00:13.769> and<00:00:13.889> one<00:00:14.040> out<00:00:14.160> of<00:00:14.190> five

00:00:15.049 --> 00:00:15.059 
that in fact exists and one out of five

00:00:15.059 --> 00:00:17.599 
that in fact exists and one out of five
males<00:00:15.929> where<00:00:16.710> you<00:00:16.859> have<00:00:17.070> an<00:00:17.220> over

00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:25.230 
veins immediately above the testes in

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:26.450 
veins immediately above the testes in
your<00:00:25.470> scrotum<00:00:25.710> and<00:00:25.949> I<00:00:25.980> think<00:00:26.189> we<00:00:26.279> have<00:00:26.430> a

00:00:26.450 --> 00:00:26.460 
your scrotum and I think we have a

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:28.279 
your scrotum and I think we have a
picture<00:00:26.730> to<00:00:27.269> show<00:00:27.480> you<00:00:27.539> that<00:00:27.810> now<00:00:27.960> it's<00:00:28.109> not

00:00:28.279 --> 00:00:28.289 
picture to show you that now it's not

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:31.189 
picture to show you that now it's not
conclusive<00:00:28.920> here<00:00:29.640> but<00:00:30.029> it<00:00:30.330> may<00:00:30.779> give<00:00:31.050> us

00:00:31.189 --> 00:00:31.199 
conclusive here but it may give us

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:33.139 
conclusive here but it may give us
information<00:00:31.650> that<00:00:32.219> in<00:00:32.340> this<00:00:32.489> group<00:00:32.700> of<00:00:32.820> people

00:00:33.139 --> 00:00:33.149 
information that in this group of people

00:00:33.149 --> 00:00:35.090 
information that in this group of people
it<00:00:33.239> may<00:00:33.450> affect<00:00:33.870> the<00:00:34.380> production<00:00:34.950> of

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:35.100 
it may affect the production of

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:37.940 
it may affect the production of
testosterone<00:00:35.370> as<00:00:36.239> you<00:00:36.989> grow<00:00:37.290> and<00:00:37.500> varicocele

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:37.950 
testosterone as you grow and varicocele

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:42.380 
testosterone as you grow and varicocele
as<00:00:38.660> I<00:00:39.660> said<00:00:39.930> pretty<00:00:40.170> common<00:00:40.739> and<00:00:40.969> the<00:00:41.969> only<00:00:42.239> way

00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:42.390 
as I said pretty common and the only way

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:45.080 
as I said pretty common and the only way
to<00:00:42.450> make<00:00:42.690> that<00:00:42.870> diagnosis<00:00:43.649> is<00:00:44.090> examining

00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:45.090 
to make that diagnosis is examining

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:47.150 
to make that diagnosis is examining
yourself<00:00:45.600> and<00:00:45.840> feeling<00:00:46.350> your<00:00:46.590> testes<00:00:46.950> that

00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:47.160 
yourself and feeling your testes that

so you're looking yourself in the mirror
here<00:01:19.710> first<00:01:20.040> thing<00:01:20.310> just<00:01:20.610> visualize<00:01:21.509> do<00:01:21.810> you

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:21.900 
here first thing just visualize do you

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:24.140 
here first thing just visualize do you
see<00:01:22.200> any<00:01:22.470> dimpling<00:01:22.979> any<00:01:23.220> retraction<00:01:23.939> any

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:24.150 
see any dimpling any retraction any

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:26.749 
see any dimpling any retraction any
pulling<00:01:24.479> any<00:01:24.810> asymmetry<00:01:25.500> now<00:01:26.250> it's<00:01:26.400> normal

00:01:26.749 --> 00:01:26.759 
pulling any asymmetry now it's normal

00:01:26.759 --> 00:01:28.789 
pulling any asymmetry now it's normal
that<00:01:26.790> the<00:01:27.030> left<00:01:27.240> side<00:01:27.360> does<00:01:28.110> hang<00:01:28.409> a<00:01:28.530> little

00:01:28.789 --> 00:01:28.799 
that the left side does hang a little

00:01:28.799 --> 00:01:31.010 
that the left side does hang a little
bit<00:01:28.979> more<00:01:29.939> than<00:01:30.150> the<00:01:30.240> right<00:01:30.420> side<00:01:30.689> there's<00:01:30.960> a

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:31.020 
bit more than the right side there's a

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:32.450 
bit more than the right side there's a
reason<00:01:31.380> for<00:01:31.590> that<00:01:31.650> the<00:01:31.860> vein<00:01:32.040> go<00:01:32.189> into<00:01:32.369> the

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:32.460 
reason for that the vein go into the

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:35.030 
reason for that the vein go into the
testes<00:01:32.939> has<00:01:33.689> a<00:01:33.720> longer<00:01:34.079> route<00:01:34.409> therefore

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:35.040 
testes has a longer route therefore

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:36.499 
testes has a longer route therefore
there's<00:01:35.280> a<00:01:35.310> little<00:01:35.490> more<00:01:35.640> weight<00:01:35.880> on<00:01:35.909> it<00:01:36.240> but

00:01:36.499 --> 00:01:36.509 
there's a little more weight on it but

00:01:36.509 --> 00:01:39.890 
there's a little more weight on it but
if<00:01:36.750> you<00:01:36.900> really<00:01:36.930> saw<00:01:37.920> that<00:01:38.310> that<00:01:38.790> one<00:01:39.030> side<00:01:39.390> was

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:39.900 
if you really saw that that one side was

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:41.749 
if you really saw that that one side was
hanging<00:01:40.290> more<00:01:40.500> than<00:01:40.680> the<00:01:40.799> other<00:01:40.979> side<00:01:41.310> then

00:01:41.749 --> 00:01:41.759 
hanging more than the other side then

00:01:41.759 --> 00:01:44.749 
hanging more than the other side then
that<00:01:41.939> could<00:01:42.329> be<00:01:42.509> an<00:01:42.600> issue<00:01:42.780> of<00:01:43.140> alarm<00:01:43.860> the<00:01:44.430> next

00:01:44.749 --> 00:01:44.759 
that could be an issue of alarm the next

00:01:44.759 --> 00:01:46.999 
that could be an issue of alarm the next
thing<00:01:44.939> you<00:01:45.090> want<00:01:45.329> to<00:01:45.390> do<00:01:45.570> is<00:01:45.840> feel<00:01:46.439> your<00:01:46.619> testes

00:01:46.999 --> 00:01:47.009 
thing you want to do is feel your testes

00:01:47.009 --> 00:01:51.679 
thing you want to do is feel your testes
and<00:01:47.270> the<00:01:48.270> way<00:01:48.420> to<00:01:48.479> do<00:01:48.750> that<00:01:48.960> is<00:01:49.409> is<00:01:50.570> with<00:01:51.570> your

00:01:51.679 --> 00:01:51.689 
and the way to do that is is with your

00:01:51.689 --> 00:01:53.960 
and the way to do that is is with your
