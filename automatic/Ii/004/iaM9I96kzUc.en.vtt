now<00:01:10.900> we<00:01:11.140> can<00:01:11.410> cut<00:01:11.700> plastic<00:01:12.700> just<00:01:13.420> a<00:01:13.630> thin<00:01:14.050> piece

00:01:14.190 --> 00:01:14.200 
now we can cut plastic just a thin piece

00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:15.900 
now we can cut plastic just a thin piece
of<00:01:14.260> plastic<00:01:14.410> i<00:01:14.920> want<00:01:15.160> to<00:01:15.250> show<00:01:15.370> you<00:01:15.400> that<00:01:15.700> you

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:15.910 
of plastic i want to show you that you

00:01:15.910 --> 00:01:18.390 
of plastic i want to show you that you
can<00:01:16.180> cut<00:01:16.480> a<00:01:16.510> straight<00:01:16.810> line<00:01:17.050> just<00:01:17.740> as<00:01:17.920> easy<00:01:18.130> as

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:18.400 
can cut a straight line just as easy as

00:01:18.400 --> 00:01:21.930 
can cut a straight line just as easy as
a<00:01:18.430> radius<00:01:19.920> for<00:01:20.920> the<00:01:21.010> plastic<00:01:21.460> is<00:01:21.550> a<00:01:21.610> little

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:21.940 
a radius for the plastic is a little

00:01:21.940 --> 00:01:23.280 
a radius for the plastic is a little
different<00:01:22.240> from<00:01:22.330> the<00:01:22.480> glass<00:01:22.720> you<00:01:23.020> need<00:01:23.170> to

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:23.290 
different from the glass you need to

00:01:23.290 --> 00:01:26.610 
different from the glass you need to
make<00:01:23.500> a<00:01:24.190> groove<00:01:24.790> in<00:01:25.060> the<00:01:25.120> plastic<00:01:25.630> about<00:01:26.320> ten

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:26.620 
make a groove in the plastic about ten

00:01:26.620 --> 00:01:28.770 
make a groove in the plastic about ten
percent<00:01:26.830> so<00:01:27.400> a<00:01:27.430> thin<00:01:27.790> piece<00:01:27.970> of<00:01:28.150> plastic<00:01:28.210> like

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:28.780 
percent so a thin piece of plastic like

00:01:28.780 --> 00:01:32.520 
percent so a thin piece of plastic like
that<00:01:29.050> just<00:01:29.800> make<00:01:30.700> a<00:01:30.730> groove<00:01:31.090> good<00:01:31.900> three<00:01:32.260> times

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:32.530 
that just make a groove good three times

00:01:32.530 --> 00:01:35.100 
that just make a groove good three times
put<00:01:33.400> it<00:01:33.520> over<00:01:33.670> the<00:01:33.850> edge<00:01:33.940> of<00:01:34.120> the<00:01:34.210> table<00:01:34.450> just

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:35.110 
put it over the edge of the table just

00:01:35.110 --> 00:01:37.110 
put it over the edge of the table just
snap<00:01:35.350> it<00:01:35.380> you<00:01:35.800> got<00:01:35.950> a<00:01:35.980> nice<00:01:36.159> sharp<00:01:36.520> clean<00:01:36.850> cut

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:37.120 
snap it you got a nice sharp clean cut

00:01:37.120 --> 00:01:40.350 
snap it you got a nice sharp clean cut
now<00:01:37.990> cut<00:01:38.320> the<00:01:38.460> different<00:01:39.460> types<00:01:39.670> of<00:01:39.850> plastic

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:40.360 
now cut the different types of plastic

00:01:40.360 --> 00:01:42.960 
now cut the different types of plastic
this<00:01:40.900> looks<00:01:41.140> like<00:01:41.350> glass<00:01:41.650> it<00:01:42.400> isn't<00:01:42.760> glass

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:42.970 
this looks like glass it isn't glass

00:01:42.970 --> 00:01:47.610 
this looks like glass it isn't glass
it's<00:01:43.330> plastic<00:01:44.730> cut<00:01:45.730> the<00:01:45.909> smooth<00:01:46.210> side<00:01:46.510> do<00:01:47.470> the

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:47.620 
it's plastic cut the smooth side do the

00:01:47.620 --> 00:01:51.380 
it's plastic cut the smooth side do the
same<00:01:47.860> thing<00:01:48.720> little<00:01:49.720> groove<00:01:49.930> in<00:01:50.290> the

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:51.390 
same thing little groove in the

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:56.370 
same thing little groove in the
Plexiglas<00:01:53.670> once<00:01:54.670> you<00:01:54.820> have<00:01:55.000> a<00:01:55.030> groove<00:01:55.380> about

00:01:56.370 --> 00:01:56.380 
Plexiglas once you have a groove about

00:01:56.380 --> 00:01:58.410 
Plexiglas once you have a groove about
ten<00:01:56.650> percent

00:01:58.410 --> 00:01:58.420 
ten percent

00:01:58.420 --> 00:02:03.399 
ten percent
go<00:01:59.420> to<00:01:59.479> the<00:01:59.630> very<00:01:59.810> end<00:02:00.700> it's<00:02:01.700> unforgiving<00:02:02.450> you

00:02:03.399 --> 00:02:03.409 
go to the very end it's unforgiving you

00:02:03.409 --> 00:02:09.940 
go to the very end it's unforgiving you
can<00:02:03.560> cut<00:02:03.740> plexiglass<00:02:04.579> it<00:02:05.380> put<00:02:06.380> a<00:02:08.950> straight

00:02:09.940 --> 00:02:09.950 
can cut plexiglass it put a straight

00:02:09.950 --> 00:02:15.190 
can cut plexiglass it put a straight
edge<00:02:10.160> down<00:02:10.459> and<00:02:11.590> I'll<00:02:12.590> clamp<00:02:12.980> this<00:02:13.250> side<00:02:14.200> and

00:02:15.190 --> 00:02:15.200 
edge down and I'll clamp this side and

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:23.640 
edge down and I'll clamp this side and
then<00:02:16.010> i<00:02:16.190> will<00:02:17.590> make<00:02:18.590> a<00:02:18.620> groove<00:02:18.950> in<00:02:19.129> the<00:02:20.440> plastic

about<00:02:24.650> ten<00:02:24.920> percent<00:02:27.760> so<00:02:28.760> do<00:02:29.030> this<00:02:29.239> three<00:02:29.480> or

00:02:29.559 --> 00:02:29.569 
about ten percent so do this three or

00:02:29.569 --> 00:02:34.750 
about ten percent so do this three or
four<00:02:29.750> times<00:02:30.910> go<00:02:31.910> to<00:02:31.970> the<00:02:32.180> very<00:02:32.510> edge<00:02:33.760> plastic

00:02:34.750 --> 00:02:34.760 
four times go to the very edge plastic

00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:38.319 
four times go to the very edge plastic
