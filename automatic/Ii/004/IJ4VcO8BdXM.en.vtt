00:00:03.310 --> 00:00:08.259 

I'm<00:00:04.310> on<00:00:04.519> in<00:00:04.790> a<00:00:04.910> field<00:00:05.180> on<00:00:05.540> the<00:00:05.600> farm<00:00:06.140> and<00:00:07.269> I'm

00:00:08.259 --> 00:00:08.269 
I'm on in a field on the farm and I'm

00:00:08.269 --> 00:00:10.709 
I'm on in a field on the farm and I'm
surrounded<00:00:08.540> by<00:00:08.990> crops<00:00:09.440> this<00:00:09.889> yellow<00:00:10.250> stuff

00:00:10.709 --> 00:00:10.719 
surrounded by crops this yellow stuff

00:00:10.719 --> 00:00:16.299 
surrounded by crops this yellow stuff
oilseed<00:00:11.719> rape<00:00:13.119> but<00:00:14.119> it's<00:00:14.329> a<00:00:14.679> crop<00:00:15.679> that's<00:00:16.010> been

00:00:16.299 --> 00:00:16.309 
oilseed rape but it's a crop that's been

00:00:16.309 --> 00:00:19.500 
oilseed rape but it's a crop that's been
grown<00:00:16.610> for<00:00:16.940> the<00:00:17.780> oil<00:00:17.900> not<00:00:18.890> for<00:00:19.070> the<00:00:19.160> food

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:19.510 
grown for the oil not for the food

00:00:19.510 --> 00:00:22.840 
grown for the oil not for the food
nobody's<00:00:20.510> going<00:00:20.660> to<00:00:20.750> eat<00:00:20.900> this<00:00:21.140> and<00:00:21.850> the

00:00:22.840 --> 00:00:22.850 
nobody's going to eat this and the

00:00:22.850 --> 00:00:25.390 
nobody's going to eat this and the
reason<00:00:23.060> it's<00:00:23.420> been<00:00:23.600> grown<00:00:23.960> is<00:00:24.320> because<00:00:25.250> we

00:00:25.390 --> 00:00:25.400 
reason it's been grown is because we

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:27.400 
reason it's been grown is because we
need<00:00:25.610> to<00:00:25.790> start<00:00:26.000> making<00:00:26.240> chemicals<00:00:27.080> from

00:00:27.400 --> 00:00:27.410 
need to start making chemicals from

00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:31.120 
need to start making chemicals from
plants<00:00:28.010> and<00:00:28.280> not<00:00:29.180> from<00:00:29.930> oil<00:00:30.200> that<00:00:30.710> we're<00:00:30.920> using

00:00:31.120 --> 00:00:31.130 
plants and not from oil that we're using

00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:35.380 
plants and not from oil that we're using
at<00:00:31.370> the<00:00:31.400> moment<00:00:33.340> now<00:00:34.340> the<00:00:34.400> reason<00:00:34.730> that<00:00:34.940> we<00:00:35.180> can

00:00:35.380 --> 00:00:35.390 
at the moment now the reason that we can

00:00:35.390 --> 00:00:38.880 
at the moment now the reason that we can
make<00:00:35.600> chemicals<00:00:36.350> from<00:00:36.500> plants<00:00:37.100> is<00:00:37.660> because

00:00:38.880 --> 00:00:38.890 
make chemicals from plants is because

00:00:38.890 --> 00:00:42.790 
make chemicals from plants is because
plants<00:00:40.030> can<00:00:41.030> use<00:00:41.360> the<00:00:41.750> energy<00:00:42.200> from<00:00:42.230> the<00:00:42.470> Sun

00:00:42.790 --> 00:00:42.800 
plants can use the energy from the Sun

00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:46.180 
plants can use the energy from the Sun
there<00:00:43.790> isn't<00:00:44.090> much<00:00:44.239> today<00:00:44.540> but<00:00:44.960> to<00:00:45.710> use<00:00:45.890> the

00:00:46.180 --> 00:00:46.190 
there isn't much today but to use the

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:50.710 
there isn't much today but to use the
sunlight<00:00:46.750> to<00:00:48.489> capture<00:00:49.489> this<00:00:49.640> carbon<00:00:50.149> dioxide

00:00:50.710 --> 00:00:50.720 
sunlight to capture this carbon dioxide

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:53.020 
sunlight to capture this carbon dioxide
in<00:00:50.930> the<00:00:50.960> air<00:00:51.050> and<00:00:51.470> to<00:00:52.160> change<00:00:52.430> them<00:00:52.820> into

00:00:53.020 --> 00:00:53.030 
in the air and to change them into

00:00:53.030 --> 00:00:55.630 
in the air and to change them into
organic<00:00:53.690> chemicals<00:00:54.410> with<00:00:54.829> carbon<00:00:55.280> hydrogen

00:00:55.630 --> 00:00:55.640 
organic chemicals with carbon hydrogen

00:00:55.640 --> 00:01:00.280 
organic chemicals with carbon hydrogen
carbon<00:00:56.480> carbon<00:00:56.960> bonds<00:00:58.390> the<00:00:59.390> problem<00:00:59.870> is<00:01:00.020> that

00:01:00.280 --> 00:01:00.290 
carbon carbon bonds the problem is that

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:03.850 
carbon carbon bonds the problem is that
crops<00:01:01.100> like<00:01:01.399> this<00:01:01.750> oilseed<00:01:02.750> rape<00:01:02.809> this<00:01:03.680> has

00:01:03.850 --> 00:01:03.860 
crops like this oilseed rape this has

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:06.789 
crops like this oilseed rape this has
just<00:01:04.009> been<00:01:04.129> grown<00:01:04.460> for<00:01:04.489> the<00:01:04.790> seeds<00:01:05.059> and<00:01:05.799> so

00:01:06.789 --> 00:01:06.799 
just been grown for the seeds and so

00:01:06.799 --> 00:01:09.100 
just been grown for the seeds and so
much<00:01:07.100> of<00:01:07.370> the<00:01:07.400> rest<00:01:07.670> of<00:01:07.909> the<00:01:08.000> plant<00:01:08.240> is<00:01:08.540> wasted

00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:09.110 
much of the rest of the plant is wasted

00:01:09.110 --> 00:01:13.990 
much of the rest of the plant is wasted
and<00:01:10.690> if<00:01:11.690> we<00:01:12.409> really<00:01:12.710> want<00:01:13.040> to<00:01:13.220> make<00:01:13.370> chemicals

00:01:13.990 --> 00:01:14.000 
and if we really want to make chemicals

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:16.899 
and if we really want to make chemicals
on<00:01:14.240> a<00:01:14.299> large<00:01:14.690> scale<00:01:15.049> we<00:01:15.920> can't<00:01:16.190> just<00:01:16.460> use<00:01:16.700> the

00:01:16.899 --> 00:01:16.909 
on a large scale we can't just use the

00:01:16.909 --> 00:01:20.020 
on a large scale we can't just use the
seeds<00:01:17.150> we've<00:01:17.960> got<00:01:18.110> to<00:01:18.260> use<00:01:18.409> it<00:01:18.590> all<00:01:18.970> now<00:01:19.970> the

00:01:20.020 --> 00:01:20.030 
seeds we've got to use it all now the

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:22.899 
seeds we've got to use it all now the
challenge<00:01:20.570> for<00:01:20.720> chemists<00:01:21.380> is<00:01:21.530> how<00:01:22.490> do<00:01:22.549> you<00:01:22.670> use

00:01:22.899 --> 00:01:22.909 
challenge for chemists is how do you use

00:01:22.909 --> 00:01:26.530 
challenge for chemists is how do you use
the<00:01:23.119> rest<00:01:23.330> of<00:01:23.510> the<00:01:23.600> plant<00:01:24.460> how<00:01:25.460> can<00:01:25.790> you<00:01:25.820> turn<00:01:26.180> a

00:01:26.530 --> 00:01:26.540 
the rest of the plant how can you turn a

00:01:26.540 --> 00:01:28.840 
the rest of the plant how can you turn a
plant<00:01:27.049> all<00:01:27.440> this<00:01:27.619> green<00:01:27.920> stuff<00:01:28.159> into

00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:28.850 
plant all this green stuff into

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:32.500 
plant all this green stuff into
chemicals<00:01:30.340> where<00:01:31.340> there<00:01:31.520> are<00:01:31.700> maybe<00:01:32.090> a<00:01:32.270> few

00:01:32.500 --> 00:01:32.510 
chemicals where there are maybe a few

00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:36.010 
chemicals where there are maybe a few
chemicals<00:01:32.810> like<00:01:33.530> the<00:01:33.890> yellow<00:01:34.610> dye<00:01:35.030> that's

00:01:36.010 --> 00:01:36.020 
chemicals like the yellow dye that's

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:39.190 
chemicals like the yellow dye that's
making<00:01:36.920> the<00:01:37.040> plants<00:01:37.729> and<00:01:37.939> the<00:01:38.570> flowers<00:01:38.930> yellow

00:01:39.190 --> 00:01:39.200 
making the plants and the flowers yellow

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:41.560 
making the plants and the flowers yellow
that<00:01:39.979> you<00:01:40.130> could<00:01:40.340> actually<00:01:40.460> extract<00:01:41.180> but

00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:41.570 
that you could actually extract but

00:01:41.570 --> 00:01:43.179 
that you could actually extract but
there'll<00:01:41.780> only<00:01:41.869> be<00:01:42.049> tiny<00:01:42.409> quantities<00:01:43.010> of

00:01:43.179 --> 00:01:43.189 
there'll only be tiny quantities of

00:01:43.189 --> 00:01:46.149 
there'll only be tiny quantities of
these<00:01:43.520> so<00:01:44.420> you've<00:01:44.600> got<00:01:44.630> to<00:01:44.960> do<00:01:45.110> something<00:01:45.560> much

00:01:46.149 --> 00:01:46.159 
these so you've got to do something much

00:01:46.159 --> 00:01:49.390 
these so you've got to do something much
more<00:01:46.520> radical<00:01:47.180> if<00:01:47.810> you're<00:01:48.320> going<00:01:48.500> to<00:01:48.619> get<00:01:48.860> the

00:01:49.390 --> 00:01:49.400 
more radical if you're going to get the

00:01:49.400 --> 00:01:51.039 
more radical if you're going to get the
carbon<00:01:49.939> that<00:01:50.060> has<00:01:50.119> been<00:01:50.420> captured<00:01:50.659> from<00:01:50.960> the

00:01:51.039 --> 00:01:51.049 
carbon that has been captured from the

00:01:51.049 --> 00:01:55.780 
carbon that has been captured from the
air<00:01:51.290> and<00:01:51.560> turn<00:01:52.100> them<00:01:52.280> into<00:01:52.369> chemicals<00:01:54.790> one

00:01:55.780 --> 00:01:55.790 
air and turn them into chemicals one

00:01:55.790 --> 00:01:59.170 
air and turn them into chemicals one
thing<00:01:56.090> that<00:01:56.270> you<00:01:56.299> could<00:01:56.570> do<00:01:56.780> is<00:01:57.590> to<00:01:58.310> take<00:01:58.939> the

00:01:59.170 --> 00:01:59.180 
thing that you could do is to take the

00:01:59.180 --> 00:02:01.210 
thing that you could do is to take the
molecules<00:01:59.720> to<00:01:59.900> bits<00:02:00.110> and<00:02:00.500> turn<00:02:00.860> them<00:02:01.100> into

00:02:01.210 --> 00:02:01.220 
molecules to bits and turn them into

00:02:01.220 --> 00:02:05.590 
molecules to bits and turn them into
hydrogen<00:02:02.180> and<00:02:02.509> carbon<00:02:02.780> monoxide<00:02:03.020> CO<00:02:03.979> and<00:02:04.600> then

00:02:05.590 --> 00:02:05.600 
hydrogen and carbon monoxide CO and then

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:08.999 
hydrogen and carbon monoxide CO and then
start<00:02:06.079> making<00:02:06.950> the<00:02:07.040> molecules<00:02:07.549> from<00:02:07.670> scratch

00:02:08.999 --> 00:02:09.009 
start making the molecules from scratch

00:02:09.009 --> 00:02:12.690 
start making the molecules from scratch
but<00:02:10.009> that's<00:02:10.220> an<00:02:10.429> awful<00:02:10.789> waste<00:02:10.970> of<00:02:11.239> energy<00:02:11.720> and

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:12.700 
but that's an awful waste of energy and

00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:15.710 
but that's an awful waste of energy and
you're<00:02:13.700> wasting<00:02:14.300> all<00:02:14.510> the<00:02:14.810> bonds<00:02:15.050> that<00:02:15.260> the

00:02:15.710 --> 00:02:15.720 
you're wasting all the bonds that the

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:20.780 
you're wasting all the bonds that the
have<00:02:16.110> made<00:02:17.960> so<00:02:18.960> chemists<00:02:19.440> are<00:02:19.740> beginning<00:02:20.670> to

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:20.790 
have made so chemists are beginning to

00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:23.900 
have made so chemists are beginning to
think<00:02:20.820> how<00:02:21.630> they<00:02:21.930> can<00:02:22.230> take<00:02:22.980> apart<00:02:23.490> the

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:23.910 
think how they can take apart the

00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:27.110 
think how they can take apart the
molecules<00:02:24.450> between<00:02:24.720> the<00:02:24.960> plants<00:02:25.880> most<00:02:26.880> of

00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:27.120 
molecules between the plants most of

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:30.080 
molecules between the plants most of
them<00:02:27.240> are<00:02:27.360> very<00:02:27.660> large<00:02:27.900> molecules<00:02:29.090> almost

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:30.090 
them are very large molecules almost

00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:33.650 
them are very large molecules almost
like<00:02:30.330> natural<00:02:30.810> plastics<00:02:31.440> and<00:02:32.240> take<00:02:33.240> them<00:02:33.450> into

00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:33.660 
like natural plastics and take them into

00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:37.130
