guitars<00:00:11.460> vol<00:00:12.120> 1

00:00:14.850 --> 00:00:14.860 

00:00:14.860 --> 00:01:18.380 

you

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:18.390 

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:21.510 

okay<00:01:19.390> I<00:01:19.420> pulled<00:01:19.780> up<00:01:19.869> reason<00:01:20.380> and<00:01:20.590> I<00:01:21.010> created<00:01:21.340> a

00:01:21.510 --> 00:01:21.520 
okay I pulled up reason and I created a

00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:23.820 
okay I pulled up reason and I created a
beat<00:01:21.790> using<00:01:22.240> one<00:01:22.390> of<00:01:22.420> the<00:01:22.600> Rex<00:01:22.810> two<00:01:23.170> files<00:01:23.500> that

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:23.830 
beat using one of the Rex two files that

00:01:23.830 --> 00:01:25.980 
beat using one of the Rex two files that
come<00:01:24.040> with<00:01:24.250> this<00:01:24.340> download<00:01:24.690> and<00:01:25.690> here's<00:01:25.900> a

00:01:25.980 --> 00:01:25.990 
come with this download and here's a

00:01:25.990 --> 00:01:32.200 
come with this download and here's a
listen<00:01:26.290> to<00:01:26.380> that<00:01:26.440> loop

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:32.210 

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:35.359 

so<00:01:33.210> as<00:01:33.479> with<00:01:33.689> the<00:01:33.840> dr.<00:01:34.200> Rex<00:01:34.409> we<00:01:34.950> can<00:01:35.130> take

00:01:35.359 --> 00:01:35.369 
so as with the dr. Rex we can take

00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:37.429 
so as with the dr. Rex we can take
individual<00:01:36.090> slices<00:01:36.390> in<00:01:36.780> this<00:01:36.929> loop<00:01:37.200> and

00:01:37.429 --> 00:01:37.439 
individual slices in this loop and

00:01:37.439 --> 00:01:49.420 
individual slices in this loop and
essentially<00:01:38.159> player<00:01:38.490> own<00:01:38.700> groove

00:01:49.420 --> 00:01:49.430 

00:01:49.430 --> 00:01:52.370 

so<00:01:50.430> simple<00:01:50.910> but<00:01:51.090> still<00:01:51.360> effective<00:01:51.900> in<00:01:52.050> its<00:01:52.170> own

00:01:52.370 --> 00:01:52.380 
so simple but still effective in its own

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:54.440 
so simple but still effective in its own
right<00:01:52.590> now<00:01:53.190> if<00:01:53.310> you<00:01:53.430> look<00:01:53.610> at<00:01:53.700> my<00:01:53.880> arrangement

00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:54.450 
right now if you look at my arrangement

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:55.790 
right now if you look at my arrangement
here<00:01:54.600> you'll<00:01:54.780> see<00:01:54.960> I've<00:01:55.050> got<00:01:55.110> some<00:01:55.290> drums

00:01:55.790 --> 00:01:55.800 
here you'll see I've got some drums

00:01:55.800 --> 00:01:58.640 
here you'll see I've got some drums
little<00:01:56.430> Waga<00:01:56.790> tar<00:01:57.030> some<00:01:57.390> effects<00:01:57.780> and<00:01:58.110> that

00:01:58.640 --> 00:01:58.650 
little Waga tar some effects and that

00:01:58.650 --> 00:02:00.950 
little Waga tar some effects and that
sort<00:01:58.950> of<00:01:59.010> thing<00:01:59.280> but<00:02:00.120> let's<00:02:00.480> take<00:02:00.660> a<00:02:00.720> listen

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:00.960 
sort of thing but let's take a listen

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:48.699 
sort of thing but let's take a listen
that<00:02:01.230> what<00:02:01.380> I<00:02:01.410> was<00:02:01.650> able<00:02:01.800> to<00:02:02.010> create

00:02:48.699 --> 00:02:48.709 

00:02:48.709 --> 00:02:52.039 

so<00:02:49.709> I<00:02:49.739> was<00:02:50.010> able<00:02:50.129> to<00:02:50.280> take<00:02:50.549> a<00:02:50.580> new<00:02:51.060> metal<00:02:51.480> guitar

00:02:52.039 --> 00:02:52.049 
so I was able to take a new metal guitar

00:02:52.049 --> 00:02:54.649 
so I was able to take a new metal guitar
riff<00:02:52.349> and<00:02:52.700> essentially<00:02:53.700> create<00:02:53.939> an<00:02:54.209> entirely

00:02:54.649 --> 00:02:54.659 
riff and essentially create an entirely

00:02:54.659 --> 00:02:57.080 
riff and essentially create an entirely
different<00:02:54.840> type<00:02:55.439> of<00:02:55.500> beat<00:02:55.860> with<00:02:56.129> it<00:02:56.280> this<00:02:56.879> kind

00:02:57.080 --> 00:02:57.090 
different type of beat with it this kind

00:02:57.090 --> 00:02:59.960 
different type of beat with it this kind
of<00:02:57.269> has<00:02:57.450> an<00:02:57.720> alternative<00:02:58.640> old-school<00:02:59.640> hip-hop

00:02:59.960 --> 00:02:59.970 
of has an alternative old-school hip-hop

00:02:59.970 --> 00:03:02.420 
of has an alternative old-school hip-hop
feel<00:03:00.390> to<00:03:00.659> it<00:03:00.829> but<00:03:01.829> that's<00:03:02.040> some<00:03:02.310> of<00:03:02.400> the

00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:02.430 
feel to it but that's some of the

00:03:02.430 --> 00:03:04.369 
feel to it but that's some of the
flexibility<00:03:03.180> you<00:03:03.329> have<00:03:03.360> when<00:03:03.900> working<00:03:04.079> with

00:03:04.369 --> 00:03:04.379 
flexibility you have when working with

00:03:04.379 --> 00:03:07.640 
flexibility you have when working with
the<00:03:04.500> rx2<00:03:05.010> files<00:03:05.659> so<00:03:06.659> this<00:03:06.840> has<00:03:06.989> been<00:03:07.110> an<00:03:07.260> inside

00:03:07.640 --> 00:03:07.650 
the rx2 files so this has been an inside

00:03:07.650 --> 00:03:09.380
