beginning of what we'll be discussing as
far<00:01:04.479> as<00:01:04.570> detoxification<00:01:05.019> is<00:01:05.980> worthwhile<00:01:06.280> if

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:06.760 
far as detoxification is worthwhile if

00:01:06.760 --> 00:01:08.370 
far as detoxification is worthwhile if
you<00:01:06.790> don't<00:01:07.030> go<00:01:07.180> past<00:01:07.450> that<00:01:07.660> but<00:01:07.900> there's<00:01:08.080> a<00:01:08.140> lot

00:01:08.370 --> 00:01:08.380 
you don't go past that but there's a lot

00:01:08.380 --> 00:01:09.530 
you don't go past that but there's a lot

days a week by chemicals in our

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:15.820 
environment that did not exist on this

00:01:15.820 --> 00:01:18.000 
environment that did not exist on this
planet<00:01:15.930> during<00:01:16.930> the<00:01:17.140> millions<00:01:17.470> of<00:01:17.560> years<00:01:17.800> that

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:18.010 
planet during the millions of years that

00:01:18.010 --> 00:01:20.370 
planet during the millions of years that
our<00:01:18.100> species<00:01:18.400> was<00:01:18.700> evolving<00:01:18.940> no<00:01:19.930> matter<00:01:20.110> how

00:01:20.370 --> 00:01:20.380 
our species was evolving no matter how

00:01:20.380 --> 00:01:22.980 
our species was evolving no matter how
we<00:01:20.440> got<00:01:20.740> here<00:01:20.800> originally<00:01:21.310> I<00:01:21.910> try<00:01:22.570> not<00:01:22.750> to<00:01:22.900> get

00:01:22.980 --> 00:01:22.990 
we got here originally I try not to get

00:01:22.990 --> 00:01:25.860 
we got here originally I try not to get
into<00:01:23.170> that<00:01:23.260> topic<00:01:23.650> from<00:01:24.430> that<00:01:24.640> point<00:01:24.970> on<00:01:25.210> we

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:25.870 
into that topic from that point on we

00:01:25.870 --> 00:01:29.520 
into that topic from that point on we
have<00:01:25.990> all<00:01:26.140> been<00:01:26.350> evolving<00:01:26.800> so<00:01:27.630> let's<00:01:28.630> just<00:01:29.020> get

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:29.530 
have all been evolving so let's just get

00:01:29.530 --> 00:01:31.740 
have all been evolving so let's just get
out<00:01:29.680> of<00:01:29.800> that<00:01:29.890> area<00:01:30.159> we've<00:01:30.850> been<00:01:30.880> evolving<00:01:31.330> for

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:31.750 
out of that area we've been evolving for

00:01:31.750 --> 00:01:33.750 
out of that area we've been evolving for
millions<00:01:32.020> of<00:01:32.140> years<00:01:32.409> and<00:01:32.710> from<00:01:33.340> the<00:01:33.550> point

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:33.760 
millions of years and from the point

00:01:33.760 --> 00:01:36.030 
millions of years and from the point
that<00:01:34.030> we<00:01:34.150> started<00:01:34.600> during<00:01:35.170> that<00:01:35.409> evolution

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:36.040 
that we started during that evolution

00:01:36.040 --> 00:01:38.280 
that we started during that evolution
all<00:01:36.430> of<00:01:37.300> these<00:01:37.480> chemicals<00:01:37.960> that<00:01:38.080> we've<00:01:38.200> been

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:38.290 
all of these chemicals that we've been

00:01:38.290 --> 00:01:42.149 
all of these chemicals that we've been
exposed<00:01:38.650> to<00:01:38.860> were<00:01:39.520> not<00:01:39.790> here<00:01:40.620> what<00:01:41.620> are<00:01:41.860> a<00:01:41.890> few

00:01:42.149 --> 00:01:42.159 
exposed to were not here what are a few

00:01:42.159 --> 00:01:44.160 
exposed to were not here what are a few
of<00:01:42.700> the<00:01:42.790> poisons<00:01:43.270> that<00:01:43.630> were<00:01:43.750> constantly

00:01:44.160 --> 00:01:44.170 
of the poisons that were constantly

00:01:44.170 --> 00:01:45.840 
of the poisons that were constantly

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:45.850 
exposed to and from which we need to

00:01:45.850 --> 00:01:47.760 
exposed to and from which we need to
detoxify<00:01:46.300> our<00:01:46.570> bodies<00:01:46.930> we're<00:01:47.470> going<00:01:47.620> to<00:01:47.680> now

00:01:47.760 --> 00:01:47.770 
detoxify our bodies we're going to now

in<00:02:08.740> other<00:02:09.280> words<00:02:09.520> it<00:02:09.850> also<00:02:10.119> kills<00:02:10.600> things

00:02:11.040 --> 00:02:11.050 
in other words it also kills things

00:02:11.050 --> 00:02:13.949
