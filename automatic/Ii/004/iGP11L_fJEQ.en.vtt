in<00:02:42.700> about<00:02:43.060> three<00:02:43.450> weeks<00:02:43.480> is<00:02:43.870> my<00:02:44.049> estimate<00:02:44.790> so

00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:45.790 
in about three weeks is my estimate so

00:02:45.790 --> 00:02:47.490 
in about three weeks is my estimate so
just<00:02:46.239> for<00:02:46.329> interests<00:02:46.630> sake<00:02:46.750> him<00:02:47.019> I've<00:02:47.290> done<00:02:47.440> a

00:02:47.490 --> 00:02:47.500 
just for interests sake him I've done a

00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:49.080 
just for interests sake him I've done a
bit<00:02:47.560> of<00:02:47.709> research<00:02:47.799> on<00:02:48.250> Peregrine<00:02:48.760> that<00:02:48.940> was

00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:49.090 
bit of research on Peregrine that was

00:02:49.090 --> 00:02:50.340 
bit of research on Peregrine that was
just<00:02:49.299> trying<00:02:49.510> to<00:02:49.540> work<00:02:49.720> out<00:02:49.900> how<00:02:50.049> long<00:02:50.200> it's

00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:50.350 
just trying to work out how long it's

00:02:50.350 --> 00:02:52.530 
just trying to work out how long it's
gonna<00:02:50.410> take<00:02:50.590> to<00:02:50.739> get<00:02:50.980> to<00:02:51.220> level<00:02:51.489> 100<00:02:51.730> and<00:02:52.180> then

00:02:52.530 --> 00:02:52.540 
gonna take to get to level 100 and then

00:02:52.540 --> 00:02:54.810 
gonna take to get to level 100 and then
there's<00:02:52.720> quite<00:02:52.870> a<00:02:52.900> few<00:02:52.989> resources<00:02:53.560> on<00:02:54.220> the

00:02:54.810 --> 00:02:54.820 
there's quite a few resources on the

00:02:54.820 --> 00:02:56.250 
there's quite a few resources on the
internet<00:02:54.850> I<00:02:55.329> mean<00:02:55.480> obviously<00:02:55.570> quite<00:02:55.959> a<00:02:56.019> few

00:02:56.250 --> 00:02:56.260 
internet I mean obviously quite a few

00:02:56.260 --> 00:02:58.410 
internet I mean obviously quite a few
good<00:02:56.380> ones<00:02:56.560> on<00:02:56.799> YouTube<00:02:57.190> but<00:02:57.910> I<00:02:57.970> mean<00:02:58.209> here's

00:02:58.410 --> 00:02:58.420 
good ones on YouTube but I mean here's

00:02:58.420 --> 00:02:59.940 
good ones on YouTube but I mean here's
an<00:02:58.540> example<00:02:58.780> of<00:02:59.019> one<00:02:59.230> of<00:02:59.260> the<00:02:59.380> ones<00:02:59.560> I<00:02:59.680> found

00:02:59.940 --> 00:02:59.950 
an example of one of the ones I found

00:02:59.950 --> 00:03:02.479 
an example of one of the ones I found
where<00:03:00.250> there<00:03:01.180> was<00:03:01.299> a<00:03:01.329> calculation<00:03:01.840> done<00:03:01.989> and

00:03:02.479 --> 00:03:02.489 
where there was a calculation done and

00:03:02.489 --> 00:03:05.610 
where there was a calculation done and
you'll<00:03:03.489> actually<00:03:03.640> see<00:03:03.970> that<00:03:04.350> the<00:03:05.350> way<00:03:05.500> it

00:03:05.610 --> 00:03:05.620 
you'll actually see that the way it

00:03:05.620 --> 00:03:08.099 
you'll actually see that the way it
works<00:03:05.650> is<00:03:06.100> for<00:03:07.000> every<00:03:07.239> level<00:03:07.540> there's<00:03:08.019> a

00:03:08.099 --> 00:03:08.109 
works is for every level there's a

00:03:08.109 --> 00:03:10.140 
works is for every level there's a
difference<00:03:08.260> of<00:03:08.709> I<00:03:09.040> think<00:03:09.430> it's<00:03:09.549> up<00:03:09.700> while

00:03:10.140 --> 00:03:10.150 
difference of I think it's up while

00:03:10.150 --> 00:03:12.900 
difference of I think it's up while
there<00:03:10.359> it<00:03:10.450> is<00:03:10.570> 1<00:03:11.140> million<00:03:11.549> four<00:03:12.549> hundred<00:03:12.579> and

00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:12.910 
there it is 1 million four hundred and

00:03:12.910 --> 00:03:16.050 
there it is 1 million four hundred and
forty<00:03:13.090> thousand<00:03:13.799> times<00:03:14.799> the<00:03:15.340> level<00:03:15.519> the<00:03:15.820> next

00:03:16.050 --> 00:03:16.060 
forty thousand times the level the next

00:03:16.060 --> 00:03:18.330 
forty thousand times the level the next
level<00:03:16.329> and<00:03:16.359> so<00:03:16.600> on<00:03:16.780> so<00:03:17.590> that<00:03:17.739> basically<00:03:17.920> means

00:03:18.330 --> 00:03:18.340 
level and so on so that basically means

00:03:18.340 --> 00:03:21.509 
level and so on so that basically means
that<00:03:18.880> ultimately<00:03:19.769> you're<00:03:20.769> going<00:03:20.950> to<00:03:21.010> have<00:03:21.160> to

00:03:21.509 --> 00:03:21.519 
that ultimately you're going to have to

00:03:21.519 --> 00:03:26.039 
that ultimately you're going to have to
do<00:03:22.359> that<00:03:22.569> times<00:03:23.500> 100<00:03:24.329> plus<00:03:25.329> the<00:03:25.540> difference<00:03:25.930> of

00:03:26.039 --> 00:03:26.049 
do that times 100 plus the difference of

00:03:26.049 --> 00:03:28.380 
do that times 100 plus the difference of
the<00:03:26.170> previous<00:03:26.500> level<00:03:26.829> which<00:03:27.670> is<00:03:27.700> quite<00:03:28.150> a<00:03:28.209> lot

00:03:28.380 --> 00:03:28.390 
the previous level which is quite a lot

00:03:28.390 --> 00:03:30.660 
the previous level which is quite a lot
of<00:03:28.470> effort<00:03:29.470> indeed

00:03:30.660 --> 00:03:30.670 
of effort indeed

00:03:30.670 --> 00:03:33.600 
of effort indeed
I<00:03:30.730> mean<00:03:31.569> of<00:03:31.720> yes<00:03:32.260> I<00:03:32.290> calculation<00:03:33.069> just<00:03:33.340> showing

00:03:33.600 --> 00:03:33.610 
I mean of yes I calculation just showing

00:03:33.610 --> 00:03:36.020 
I mean of yes I calculation just showing
you<00:03:33.700> what<00:03:34.240> it<00:03:34.330> actually<00:03:34.450> works<00:03:34.780> out<00:03:34.959> to<00:03:35.020> and

00:03:36.020 --> 00:03:36.030 
you what it actually works out to and

00:03:36.030 --> 00:03:38.339 
you what it actually works out to and
you'll<00:03:37.030> see<00:03:37.209> that<00:03:37.360> that's<00:03:37.569> quite<00:03:37.840> a<00:03:37.870> huge

00:03:38.339 --> 00:03:38.349 
you'll see that that's quite a huge

00:03:38.349 --> 00:03:40.470 
you'll see that that's quite a huge
title<00:03:38.800> at<00:03:38.890> the<00:03:38.920> end<00:03:39.130> of<00:03:39.220> day<00:03:39.400> are<00:03:40.000> you<00:03:40.120> talking

00:03:40.470 --> 00:03:40.480 
title at the end of day are you talking

00:03:40.480 --> 00:03:42.720 
title at the end of day are you talking
but<00:03:41.319> even<00:03:41.470> though<00:03:41.620> how<00:03:41.890> many<00:03:42.099> digits<00:03:42.310> others

00:03:42.720 --> 00:03:42.730 
but even though how many digits others

00:03:42.730 --> 00:03:47.760 
but even though how many digits others
but<00:03:43.000> a<00:03:43.239> lot<00:03:44.140> of<00:03:44.170> XP<00:03:45.750> see<00:03:46.750> ya<00:03:46.870> basically<00:03:47.680> it

00:03:47.760 --> 00:03:47.770 
but a lot of XP see ya basically it

00:03:47.770 --> 00:03:49.949 
but a lot of XP see ya basically it
makes<00:03:47.950> life<00:03:48.130> quite<00:03:48.370> challenging<00:03:48.780> that<00:03:49.780> means

00:03:49.949 --> 00:03:49.959 
makes life quite challenging that means

00:03:49.959 --> 00:03:51.390 
makes life quite challenging that means
the<00:03:50.200> average<00:03:50.319> player<00:03:50.770> would<00:03:50.980> probably<00:03:51.250> take

00:03:51.390 --> 00:03:51.400 
the average player would probably take

00:03:51.400 --> 00:03:54.059 
the average player would probably take
about<00:03:51.520> a<00:03:51.850> month<00:03:52.330> of<00:03:52.540> dedicated<00:03:53.470> time<00:03:53.620> just<00:03:53.950> to

00:03:54.059 --> 00:03:54.069 
about a month of dedicated time just to

00:03:54.069 --> 00:03:57.990 
about a month of dedicated time just to
achieve<00:03:54.480> Eragon<00:03:55.480> level<00:03:55.840> 100<00:03:56.790> another<00:03:57.790> thing

00:03:57.990 --> 00:03:58.000 
achieve Eragon level 100 another thing

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:00.000 
achieve Eragon level 100 another thing
another<00:03:58.420> example<00:03:58.870> I<00:03:59.080> saw<00:03:59.290> which<00:03:59.650> is<00:03:59.830> quite

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:00.010 
another example I saw which is quite

00:04:00.010 --> 00:04:02.610 
another example I saw which is quite
good<00:04:00.250> or<00:04:00.400> worse<00:04:00.930> this<00:04:01.930> one<00:04:02.110> here<00:04:02.319> which<00:04:02.470> is

00:04:02.610 --> 00:04:02.620 
good or worse this one here which is

00:04:02.620 --> 00:04:05.400 
good or worse this one here which is
fantastic<00:04:03.390> so<00:04:04.390> you<00:04:04.810> know<00:04:04.930> depending<00:04:05.290> on

00:04:05.400 --> 00:04:05.410 
fantastic so you know depending on

00:04:05.410 --> 00:04:06.900 
fantastic so you know depending on
whether<00:04:05.560> you're<00:04:05.680> under<00:04:05.920> get<00:04:06.130> over<00:04:06.459> cared<00:04:06.730> or

00:04:06.900 --> 00:04:06.910 
whether you're under get over cared or

00:04:06.910 --> 00:04:10.020 
whether you're under get over cared or
or<00:04:07.630> average<00:04:08.170> get<00:04:08.440> to<00:04:09.190> take<00:04:09.400> you<00:04:09.519> this<00:04:09.700> long<00:04:09.790> to

00:04:10.020 --> 00:04:10.030 
or average get to take you this long to

00:04:10.030 --> 00:04:12.900 
or average get to take you this long to
actually<00:04:10.360> achieve<00:04:11.080> a<00:04:11.440> certain<00:04:12.310> amount<00:04:12.610> of

00:04:12.900 --> 00:04:12.910 
actually achieve a certain amount of

00:04:12.910 --> 00:04:16.560 
actually achieve a certain amount of
havoc<00:04:13.630> on<00:04:13.840> levels<00:04:14.230> within<00:04:14.530> so<00:04:14.799> many<00:04:14.830> hours<00:04:15.570> and

00:04:16.560 --> 00:04:16.570 
havoc on levels within so many hours and

00:04:16.570 --> 00:04:18.479 
havoc on levels within so many hours and
you<00:04:16.690> can<00:04:16.840> see<00:04:16.989> even<00:04:17.590> here<00:04:17.799> at<00:04:17.979> the<00:04:18.160> end<00:04:18.280> if

00:04:18.479 --> 00:04:18.489 
you can see even here at the end if

00:04:18.489 --> 00:04:21.750 
you can see even here at the end if
you're<00:04:18.669> over<00:04:18.910> kid<00:04:19.150> you're<00:04:20.079> running<00:04:20.440> at<00:04:21.370> a<00:04:21.489> very

00:04:21.750 --> 00:04:21.760 
you're over kid you're running at a very

00:04:26.400 --> 00:04:26.410 
very you know 360 two hours so as you

very you know 360 two hours so as you
can<00:04:26.530> see<00:04:26.740> this<00:04:26.950> quite<00:04:27.220> a<00:04:27.280> lot<00:04:27.430> of<00:04:27.550> different

00:04:27.930 --> 00:04:27.940 
can see this quite a lot of different

00:04:27.940 --> 00:04:30.120 
can see this quite a lot of different
