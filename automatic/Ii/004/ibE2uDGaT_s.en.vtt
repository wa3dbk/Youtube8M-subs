00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:06.970
 hello good very good everyone here 

00:00:03.260 --> 00:00:09.280
 presenting a new video tutorial of 

00:00:06.970 --> 00:00:12.840
 another thing that we are going to do in this case 

00:00:09.280 --> 00:00:12.840
 It will be how to play 

00:00:14.360 --> 00:00:18.380
 as much in ideas as any other 

00:00:16.430 --> 00:00:21.230
 game then it would serve equal but in 

00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:24.619
 this case is easy this game itself 

00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:25.780
 I tell you how to play it worth voucher for 

00:00:24.619 --> 00:00:27.640
 start 

00:00:25.780 --> 00:00:29.910
 I have managed to compress the file and 

00:00:27.640 --> 00:00:33.060
 upload it to mega 

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:34.450
 and then we would have a view 

00:00:33.060 --> 00:00:38.290
 of 

00:00:34.450 --> 00:00:42.100
 of links quite long as you see me 

00:00:38.290 --> 00:00:44.470
 It seems that there were 38 parts 100 megabytes each 

00:00:42.100 --> 00:00:47.440
 you'll see that if it did not take too long 

00:00:44.470 --> 00:00:48.970
 up and could not go to upload because 

00:00:47.440 --> 00:00:51.580
 there were complications and I know what 

00:00:48.970 --> 00:00:55.270
 heck happened so I left I 

00:00:51.580 --> 00:00:57.280
 it left part to prove itself is not attainable 

00:00:55.270 --> 00:00:59.470
 and well, these books leave in the 

00:00:57.280 --> 00:01:01.450
 description of the video so I can tell you 

00:00:59.470 --> 00:01:04.210
 you can download if you want 

00:01:01.450 --> 00:01:06.220
 and now let's see how to play 

00:01:04.210 --> 00:01:10.370
 The first thing you have to do is go to 

00:01:06.220 --> 00:01:12.920
 internet and put one of these 

00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:14.830
 good of this two links that will take you to 

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:16.540
 the page 

00:01:14.830 --> 00:01:18.580
 and then you give to download files 

00:01:16.540 --> 00:01:21.490
 Then proceed to download 

00:01:18.580 --> 00:01:23.150
 mega spaces you do with the 38 

00:01:21.490 --> 00:01:25.760
 records 

00:01:23.150 --> 00:01:28.120
 and once you have downloaded all 

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:29.920
 the portal assets 

00:01:28.120 --> 00:01:32.680
 a lot of files 

00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:36.140
 great is that it is compressed because no 

00:01:32.680 --> 00:01:38.000
 are as many as they would have to do it 

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:40.370
 it is important to have them all 

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:42.850
 then we go to the first one and we give 

00:01:40.370 --> 00:01:42.850
 extract here 

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:52.490
 and then in the same folder it will appear 

00:01:47.909 --> 00:01:52.490
 that puts fx 

00:01:55.420 --> 00:02:01.290
 and good because the thing is that once 

00:01:57.820 --> 00:02:01.290
 let's have this iso this age 

00:02:01.570 --> 00:02:06.600
 from those files that we had before 

00:02:04.360 --> 00:02:06.600
 after 

00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:12.740
 we have to take this file with him 

00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:15.880
 with the 3 x 2, then how to get it 

00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:18.320
 very easy we open the program 

00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:20.530
 and we go to the selector of that we give to 

00:02:18.320 --> 00:02:22.819
 search for 

00:02:20.530 --> 00:02:29.420
 desk 

00:02:22.819 --> 00:02:32.630
 if you are looking for the fx air lines and give 

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:35.530
 start from full flight 

00:02:32.630 --> 00:02:37.940
 then there will be screens and it goes a little 

00:02:35.530 --> 00:02:39.700
 normal because I'm recording with the 

00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:42.819
 bambi fields 

00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:43.940
 it does not support the pcs x2 but because it goes 

00:02:42.819 --> 00:02:46.530
 very slow 

00:02:43.940 --> 00:02:49.560
 [Music] 

00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:52.380
 this is normal that they come out of ps2 is 

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:55.080
 something absolutely normal 

00:02:52.380 --> 00:02:57.660
 and we agreed that you have to configure the 

00:02:55.080 --> 00:02:58.890
 keyboard before you play 

00:02:57.660 --> 00:03:00.810
 because if we are not going to press this 

00:02:58.890 --> 00:03:04.970
 classic will not work but as you can see 

00:03:00.810 --> 00:03:04.970
 here we have working perfectly 

00:03:06.760 --> 00:03:10.630
 and because I know I can forgive 

00:03:09.080 --> 00:03:12.820
 lives or whatever 

00:03:10.630 --> 00:03:14.980
 but what I say will pay a little 

00:03:12.820 --> 00:03:18.100
 because I can not stand it until the fire but 

00:03:14.980 --> 00:03:20.580
 well I'm going to do something for you to see 

00:03:18.100 --> 00:03:20.580
 it works 

00:03:33.740 --> 00:03:38.200
 for those interested until the fire 

00:03:35.330 --> 00:03:42.010
 it's pretty good you know why 

00:03:38.200 --> 00:03:43.770
 to play I started quietly to the 

00:03:42.010 --> 00:03:45.060
 sea ​​of ​​good 

00:03:43.770 --> 00:03:46.830
 but for you to see that it works 

00:03:45.060 --> 00:03:48.060
 perfectly 

00:03:46.830 --> 00:03:49.580
 needless 

00:03:48.060 --> 00:03:52.910
 [Music] 

00:03:49.580 --> 00:03:54.510
 but we need good 

00:03:52.910 --> 00:03:58.010
 and not 

00:03:54.510 --> 00:03:58.010
 as you see it works perfectly 

00:04:00.910 --> 00:04:05.110
 and good things for this tutorial 

00:04:03.520 --> 00:04:06.680
 I hope you liked it 

00:04:05.110 --> 00:04:09.560
 all right 

00:04:06.680 --> 00:04:12.939
 and well, we're still here in 

00:04:09.560 --> 00:04:12.939
 contact to see here then
