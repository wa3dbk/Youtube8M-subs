00:00:07.550 --> 00:00:07.560 
we're outdoors today and I'm doing my

00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:10.940 
we're outdoors today and I'm doing my
first<00:00:07.830> test<00:00:08.460> on<00:00:08.790> my<00:00:09.000> cold<00:00:09.300> steel<00:00:09.570> Sharky<00:00:10.170> here

00:00:10.940 --> 00:00:10.950 
first test on my cold steel Sharky here

00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:15.350 
first test on my cold steel Sharky here
is<00:00:11.219> the<00:00:11.759> Sharky<00:00:13.099> this<00:00:14.099> is<00:00:14.280> a<00:00:14.309> pen<00:00:14.759> from<00:00:14.790> cold

00:00:15.350 --> 00:00:15.360 
is the Sharky this is a pen from cold

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:17.660 
is the Sharky this is a pen from cold
steel<00:00:15.660> that<00:00:15.929> is<00:00:15.990> supposedly<00:00:16.670> virtually

00:00:17.660 --> 00:00:17.670 
steel that is supposedly virtually

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:20.090 
steel that is supposedly virtually
indestructible<00:00:18.630> and<00:00:18.779> they<00:00:19.380> do<00:00:19.439> add<00:00:19.680> that<00:00:19.890> word

00:00:20.090 --> 00:00:20.100 
indestructible and they do add that word

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:21.980 
indestructible and they do add that word
virtually<00:00:20.400> so<00:00:20.939> it<00:00:21.210> obviously<00:00:21.420> is

00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:21.990 
virtually so it obviously is

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:24.410 
virtually so it obviously is
destructible<00:00:22.939> but<00:00:23.939> I'm<00:00:24.029> going<00:00:24.119> to<00:00:24.180> be<00:00:24.300> putting

destructible but I'm going to be putting

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:26.029 
destructible but I'm going to be putting

actually before I started up the cameras
there's<00:01:32.189> not<00:01:32.340> really<00:01:32.520> a<00:01:32.640> whole<00:01:32.700> lot<00:01:32.850> of<00:01:33.030> ice

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:33.270

00:01:36.499 --> 00:01:36.509 
just a lot of snow obviously you can see

00:01:36.509 --> 00:01:39.499 
just a lot of snow obviously you can see
there's<00:01:36.720> no<00:01:36.900> real<00:01:37.200> visible<00:01:37.710> damage<00:01:38.070> I<00:01:38.579> am<00:01:39.270> just

00:01:39.499 --> 00:01:39.509 
there's no real visible damage I am just

00:01:39.509 --> 00:01:41.630 
there's no real visible damage I am just
wondering<00:01:39.720> if<00:01:40.110> the<00:01:40.409> water<00:01:40.770> has<00:01:41.040> made<00:01:41.310> its<00:01:41.460> way

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:41.640 
wondering if the water has made its way

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:43.880 
wondering if the water has made its way
inside<00:01:41.909> the<00:01:42.390> lid<00:01:42.630> that's<00:01:43.409> the<00:01:43.530> only<00:01:43.740> thing

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:43.890 
inside the lid that's the only thing

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:45.999 
inside the lid that's the only thing
that<00:01:44.040> I<00:01:44.100> think<00:01:44.310> would<00:01:44.549> cause<00:01:44.820> any<00:01:45.119> damage

00:01:45.999 --> 00:01:46.009 
that I think would cause any damage

00:01:46.009 --> 00:01:51.469 
that I think would cause any damage
gonna<00:01:47.009> just<00:01:48.350> fiddle<00:01:49.350> around<00:01:49.439> with<00:01:49.710> it<00:01:49.950> see<00:01:50.479> if

00:01:51.469 --> 00:01:51.479 
gonna just fiddle around with it see if

00:01:51.479 --> 00:01:53.630 
gonna just fiddle around with it see if
this<00:01:51.840> changes<00:01:52.140> anything<00:01:52.500> if<00:01:52.920> any<00:01:53.070> water<00:01:53.280> makes

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:53.640 
this changes anything if any water makes

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:55.870 
this changes anything if any water makes
its<00:01:53.820> way<00:01:54.000> in<00:01:54.149> the<00:01:54.240> lid<00:01:54.450> stir<00:01:55.259> it<00:01:55.439> up<00:01:55.530> a<00:01:55.710> little

00:01:55.870 --> 00:01:55.880 
its way in the lid stir it up a little

00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:58.580 
its way in the lid stir it up a little
and<00:01:56.880> we'll<00:01:57.420> come<00:01:57.570> back<00:01:57.600> in<00:01:57.780> another<00:01:58.020> hour<00:01:58.229> and

00:01:58.580 --> 00:01:58.590 
and we'll come back in another hour and

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:00.289 
and we'll come back in another hour and
see<00:01:58.770> how<00:01:58.920> it<00:01:59.070> looks<00:01:59.100> so<00:01:59.820> there<00:02:00.030> it<00:02:00.149> is<00:02:00.210> right

00:02:00.289 --> 00:02:00.299 
see how it looks so there it is right

00:02:00.299 --> 00:02:04.249 
see how it looks so there it is right
now<00:02:00.829> again<00:02:01.829> no<00:02:02.219> visible<00:02:02.909> damage<00:02:03.090> but<00:02:03.600> we'll

00:02:04.249 --> 00:02:04.259 
now again no visible damage but we'll

00:02:04.259 --> 00:02:05.870 
now again no visible damage but we'll
see<00:02:04.439> what<00:02:04.560> happens<00:02:04.710> later<00:02:05.100> when<00:02:05.549> that<00:02:05.579> ice

00:02:05.870 --> 00:02:05.880 
see what happens later when that ice

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:08.029 
see what happens later when that ice
completely<00:02:06.450> forms<00:02:06.840> and<00:02:07.049> then<00:02:07.140> they'll<00:02:07.320> smash

00:02:08.029 --> 00:02:08.039 
completely forms and then they'll smash

00:02:08.039 --> 00:02:09.800 
completely forms and then they'll smash
it<00:02:08.280> off<00:02:08.429> and<00:02:08.700> we'll<00:02:08.789> see<00:02:08.970> if<00:02:09.119> if<00:02:09.420> there's<00:02:09.690> any

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:09.810 
it off and we'll see if if there's any

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:11.960 
it off and we'll see if if there's any
damage<00:02:10.020> all<00:02:10.440> maybe<00:02:11.280> come<00:02:11.520> back<00:02:11.700> in<00:02:11.879> another

00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:11.970 
damage all maybe come back in another

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:13.460 
damage all maybe come back in another
hour<00:02:12.209> or<00:02:12.480> so<00:02:12.750> and<00:02:12.930> we'll

i'm going to see what happens when i try
to<00:02:25.650> take<00:02:25.920> it<00:02:25.950> out<00:02:26.190> i<00:02:26.400> have<00:02:26.820> a<00:02:26.850> hammer<00:02:27.150> here<00:02:27.540> but

there it is you can see it's completely

00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:46.940 
there it is you can see it's completely
frozen<00:02:44.750> it's<00:02:45.750> cold<00:02:46.020> out<00:02:46.170> here<00:02:46.410> i'm<00:02:46.560> gonna<00:02:46.740> try

00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:46.950 
frozen it's cold out here i'm gonna try

00:02:46.950 --> 00:02:57.199 
frozen it's cold out here i'm gonna try
to<00:02:47.040> try<00:02:47.820> to<00:02:47.880> bend<00:02:48.090> it<00:02:48.209> out<00:02:48.390> now<00:02:54.500> ok<00:02:55.910> so<00:02:56.910> there<00:02:57.060> is

00:02:57.199 --> 00:02:57.209 
to try to bend it out now ok so there is

00:02:57.209 --> 00:03:05.530 
to try to bend it out now ok so there is
the<00:02:57.420> water<00:02:57.660> in<00:02:57.930> it<00:03:01.940> so<00:03:02.940> that<00:03:03.180> much<00:03:03.390> still

00:03:05.530 --> 00:03:05.540 
the water in it so that much still

00:03:05.540 --> 00:03:10.400 
the water in it so that much still
didn't<00:03:06.540> get<00:03:06.660> frozen<00:03:07.020> so<00:03:08.360> there<00:03:09.360> it<00:03:09.480> is<00:03:09.600> I<00:03:09.959> guess

00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:10.410 
didn't get frozen so there it is I guess

00:03:10.410 --> 00:03:12.470 
didn't get frozen so there it is I guess
all<00:03:10.650> here<00:03:11.130> this<00:03:11.340> is<00:03:11.459> a<00:03:11.580> big<00:03:11.820> air<00:03:12.030> bubble<00:03:12.360> right

00:04:00.819 --> 00:04:00.829 
take the lid off see if it's actually

00:04:00.829 --> 00:04:06.039 
take the lid off see if it's actually
even<00:04:01.189> easy<00:04:01.549> to<00:04:01.760> take<00:04:01.939> the<00:04:02.060> lid<00:04:02.239> off<00:04:04.090> okay<00:04:05.090> so<00:04:05.870> it

00:04:06.039 --> 00:04:06.049 
even easy to take the lid off okay so it

00:04:06.049 --> 00:04:08.289 
even easy to take the lid off okay so it
was<00:04:06.200> a<00:04:06.230> little<00:04:06.409> bit<00:04:06.620> harder<00:04:06.980> than<00:04:07.010> the<00:04:07.879> normal

00:04:08.289 --> 00:04:08.299 
was a little bit harder than the normal

00:04:08.299 --> 00:04:11.050 
was a little bit harder than the normal
there<00:04:08.480> to<00:04:08.599> take<00:04:08.750> the<00:04:08.900> lid<00:04:09.109> off<00:04:09.140> and<00:04:09.879> it<00:04:10.879> looks

00:04:11.050 --> 00:04:11.060 
there to take the lid off and it looks

00:04:11.060 --> 00:04:14.649 
there to take the lid off and it looks
like<00:04:11.239> we<00:04:11.390> do<00:04:11.540> have<00:04:11.569> some<00:04:13.120> little<00:04:14.120> bit<00:04:14.390> of<00:04:14.420> water

00:04:14.649 --> 00:04:14.659 
like we do have some little bit of water

00:04:14.659 --> 00:04:17.890 
like we do have some little bit of water
in<00:04:15.019> there<00:04:15.260> but<00:04:15.590> not<00:04:15.709> too<00:04:15.920> much<00:04:15.950> so<00:04:16.539> it<00:04:17.539> isn't

00:04:17.890 --> 00:04:17.900 
in there but not too much so it isn't

00:04:17.900 --> 00:04:20.259 
in there but not too much so it isn't
completely<00:04:18.289> sealed<00:04:19.220> when<00:04:19.549> you<00:04:19.639> close<00:04:19.880> it<00:04:19.910> but

00:04:20.259 --> 00:04:20.269 
completely sealed when you close it but

00:04:20.269 --> 00:04:24.460 
completely sealed when you close it but
it<00:04:20.419> is<00:04:20.539> pretty<00:04:20.810> much<00:04:21.220> it's<00:04:22.220> closed<00:04:23.320> let's<00:04:24.320> have

00:04:24.460 --> 00:04:24.470 
it is pretty much it's closed let's have

00:04:24.470 --> 00:04:34.560 
it is pretty much it's closed let's have
a<00:04:24.500> little<00:04:24.650> test<00:04:24.949> with<00:04:25.160> the<00:04:25.370> with<00:04:25.729> the<00:04:25.759> pen<00:04:26.090> Oh

00:04:34.560 --> 00:04:34.570 

00:04:34.570 --> 00:04:37.659

00:04:37.659 --> 00:04:37.669 
looks like a little bit of looks a

00:04:37.669 --> 00:04:44.820
