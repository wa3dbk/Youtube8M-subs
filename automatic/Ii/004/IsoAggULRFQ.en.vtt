00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:17.530 
four or five other cats up here

00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:32.339 
four or five other cats up here
interfering<00:02:18.530> yeah<00:02:19.430> yeah<00:02:19.610> that's<00:02:20.270> good

00:02:32.339 --> 00:02:32.349 

00:02:32.349 --> 00:02:35.720 

basically<00:02:33.129> I<00:02:33.219> just<00:02:33.430> keep<00:02:33.610> cutting<00:02:33.849> back<00:02:34.090> here

00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:35.730 
basically I just keep cutting back here

00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:38.280 
basically I just keep cutting back here
it<00:02:36.730> takes<00:02:36.879> it<00:02:37.030> off<00:02:37.150> a<00:02:37.180> little<00:02:37.510> bit<00:02:37.689> to<00:02:37.959> the<00:02:38.079> time

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:38.290 
it takes it off a little bit to the time

00:02:38.290 --> 00:02:40.410 
it takes it off a little bit to the time
so<00:02:38.530> it's<00:02:38.709> a<00:02:38.769> time-consuming<00:02:38.980> process<00:02:39.420> depends

00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:40.420 
so it's a time-consuming process depends

00:02:40.420 --> 00:02:47.569 
so it's a time-consuming process depends
on<00:02:40.510> how<00:02:40.689> much<00:02:40.810> time<00:02:41.290> you<00:02:41.950> want<00:02:42.280> to<00:02:42.340> work<00:02:42.430> on<00:02:42.609> it

00:02:47.569 --> 00:02:47.579 

00:02:47.579 --> 00:02:52.050 

but<00:02:48.579> it'll<00:02:48.819> break<00:02:49.030> up<00:02:49.239> the<00:02:49.359> minutes<00:02:51.060> unless

00:02:52.050 --> 00:02:52.060 
but it'll break up the minutes unless

00:02:52.060 --> 00:02:58.170 
but it'll break up the minutes unless
