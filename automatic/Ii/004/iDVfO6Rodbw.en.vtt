00:00:07.760 --> 00:00:07.770 
everyone Ronnie Shalvis here today we're

00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:09.740 
everyone Ronnie Shalvis here today we're
going<00:00:07.890> to<00:00:07.980> be<00:00:08.040> learning<00:00:08.189> the<00:00:08.460> wall<00:00:08.670> pop-up<00:00:09.240> now

00:00:09.740 --> 00:00:09.750 
going to be learning the wall pop-up now

00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:11.480 
going to be learning the wall pop-up now
this<00:00:09.900> means<00:00:10.110> it's<00:00:10.320> similar<00:00:10.530> to<00:00:10.740> the<00:00:11.010> wall<00:00:11.219> run

00:00:11.480 --> 00:00:11.490 
this means it's similar to the wall run

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:14.509 
this means it's similar to the wall run
and<00:00:11.790> that<00:00:12.059> you<00:00:12.240> have<00:00:12.330> to<00:00:12.540> run<00:00:13.230> up<00:00:13.349> a<00:00:13.500> wall<00:00:13.710> only

00:00:14.509 --> 00:00:14.519 
and that you have to run up a wall only

00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:16.160 
and that you have to run up a wall only
instead<00:00:14.910> of<00:00:15.030> doing<00:00:15.269> the<00:00:15.360> whole<00:00:15.509> climb<00:00:15.839> up<00:00:16.020> you

00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:16.170 
instead of doing the whole climb up you

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:18.680 
instead of doing the whole climb up you
just<00:00:16.350> pop<00:00:16.920> up<00:00:17.130> this<00:00:17.609> is<00:00:17.820> used<00:00:18.060> on<00:00:18.210> generally

00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:18.690 
just pop up this is used on generally

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:20.870 
just pop up this is used on generally
medium<00:00:19.080> sized<00:00:19.380> walls<00:00:19.740> ones<00:00:20.130> just<00:00:20.369> too<00:00:20.609> high<00:00:20.820> to

00:00:20.870 --> 00:00:20.880 
medium sized walls ones just too high to

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:22.640 
medium sized walls ones just too high to
be<00:00:21.090> able<00:00:21.359> to<00:00:21.480> vault<00:00:21.689> over<00:00:22.050> but<00:00:22.470> low<00:00:22.619> enough

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:22.650 
be able to vault over but low enough

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:24.050 
be able to vault over but low enough
that<00:00:22.920> you<00:00:23.189> don't<00:00:23.340> need<00:00:23.490> to<00:00:23.609> do<00:00:23.730> the<00:00:23.880> whole

00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:24.060 
that you don't need to do the whole

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:26.570 
that you don't need to do the whole
climb<00:00:24.330> up<00:00:24.510> so<00:00:25.230> before<00:00:25.529> we<00:00:25.590> get<00:00:25.740> started<00:00:26.010> I<00:00:26.340> want

00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:26.580 
climb up so before we get started I want

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:28.160 
climb up so before we get started I want
you<00:00:26.670> to<00:00:26.789> check<00:00:26.970> out<00:00:27.119> my<00:00:27.300> wall<00:00:27.480> run<00:00:27.689> tutorial

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:28.170 
you to check out my wall run tutorial

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:30.380 
you to check out my wall run tutorial
first<00:00:28.380> you<00:00:28.830> can<00:00:28.980> watch<00:00:29.160> it<00:00:29.340> right<00:00:29.519> here<00:00:29.550> and

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:30.390 
first you can watch it right here and

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:32.479 
first you can watch it right here and
once<00:00:30.630> you've<00:00:30.750> watched<00:00:31.019> that<00:00:31.140> it's<00:00:32.009> important

00:00:32.479 --> 00:00:32.489 
once you've watched that it's important

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:34.310 
once you've watched that it's important
because<00:00:32.550> all<00:00:32.969> the<00:00:33.180> same<00:00:33.420> watering<00:00:33.870> techniques

00:00:34.310 --> 00:00:34.320 
because all the same watering techniques

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:36.500 
because all the same watering techniques
will<00:00:34.559> apply<00:00:34.860> it<00:00:34.920> should<00:00:35.219> just<00:00:35.309> move<00:00:35.670> the<00:00:36.239> only

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:36.510 
will apply it should just move the only

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:38.330 
will apply it should just move the only
difference<00:00:36.899> is<00:00:37.050> we<00:00:37.230> won't<00:00:37.350> be<00:00:37.559> doing<00:00:37.920> the<00:00:38.070> same

00:00:38.330 --> 00:00:38.340 
difference is we won't be doing the same

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:41.299 
difference is we won't be doing the same
exact<00:00:38.790> type<00:00:39.570> of<00:00:39.600> climb<00:00:40.050> up<00:00:40.260> because<00:00:41.040> we're

00:00:41.299 --> 00:00:41.309 
exact type of climb up because we're

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:43.369 
exact type of climb up because we're
going<00:00:41.460> to<00:00:41.550> put<00:00:41.700> so<00:00:41.910> much<00:00:42.090> power<00:00:42.360> into<00:00:42.870> the<00:00:43.050> kick

00:00:43.369 --> 00:00:43.379 
going to put so much power into the kick

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:46.279 
going to put so much power into the kick
off<00:00:43.559> the<00:00:43.739> wall<00:00:43.950> and<00:00:44.340> jump<00:00:44.910> up<00:00:45.090> that<00:00:45.719> our<00:00:45.960> arms

00:00:46.279 --> 00:00:46.289 
off the wall and jump up that our arms

00:00:46.289 --> 00:00:47.720 
off the wall and jump up that our arms
are<00:00:46.440> basically<00:00:46.860> just<00:00:46.920> going<00:00:47.160> to<00:00:47.340> be<00:00:47.430> there<00:00:47.610> to

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:47.730 
are basically just going to be there to

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:50.720 
are basically just going to be there to
support<00:00:47.879> us<00:00:48.270> and<00:00:48.660> pop<00:00:48.960> us<00:00:49.170> right<00:00:49.410> up<00:00:49.559> first<00:00:50.520> I

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:50.730 
support us and pop us right up first I

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:53.540 
support us and pop us right up first I
would<00:00:50.910> find<00:00:51.149> a<00:00:51.449> medium<00:00:51.780> sized<00:00:52.050> wall<00:00:52.550> one

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:53.550 
would find a medium sized wall one

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:55.430 
would find a medium sized wall one
that's<00:00:53.789> a<00:00:54.059> little<00:00:54.390> bit<00:00:54.570> difficult<00:00:54.989> for<00:00:55.050> you<00:00:55.289> to

00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:55.440 
that's a little bit difficult for you to

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:56.840 
that's a little bit difficult for you to
vault<00:00:55.649> over<00:00:56.010> it<00:00:56.129> could<00:00:56.280> be<00:00:56.430> a<00:00:56.460> little<00:00:56.730> bit

00:00:56.840 --> 00:00:56.850 
vault over it could be a little bit

00:00:56.850 --> 00:00:58.520 
vault over it could be a little bit
lower<00:00:57.059> than<00:00:57.090> this<00:00:57.420> just<00:00:57.930> something<00:00:58.320> tall

00:00:58.520 --> 00:00:58.530 
lower than this just something tall

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:00.080 
lower than this just something tall
enough<00:00:58.710> that<00:00:58.890> you<00:00:59.010> can<00:00:59.190> get<00:00:59.309> a<00:00:59.340> good<00:00:59.579> kick<00:00:59.850> on

00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:00.090 
enough that you can get a good kick on

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:02.090 
enough that you can get a good kick on
for<00:01:00.329> practice<00:01:00.780> this<00:01:01.260> is<00:01:01.440> about<00:01:01.649> shoulder

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:02.100 
for practice this is about shoulder

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:04.189 
for practice this is about shoulder
height<00:01:02.309> throughs<00:01:02.609> and<00:01:03.059> so<00:01:03.719> what<00:01:03.960> you're<00:01:04.080> going

00:01:04.189 --> 00:01:04.199 
height throughs and so what you're going

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:07.100 
height throughs and so what you're going
to<00:01:04.260> want<00:01:04.500> to<00:01:04.559> do<00:01:04.769> is<00:01:05.100> a<00:01:05.489> first<00:01:06.479> off<00:01:06.689> your<00:01:06.930> foot

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:07.110 
to want to do is a first off your foot

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:09.050 
to want to do is a first off your foot
placement<00:01:07.350> is<00:01:07.830> going<00:01:07.979> to<00:01:08.130> be<00:01:08.310> about<00:01:08.640> waist

00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:09.060 
placement is going to be about waist

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:10.880 
placement is going to be about waist
height<00:01:09.360> when<00:01:09.600> you<00:01:09.720> take<00:01:09.930> off<00:01:10.110> you<00:01:10.680> want<00:01:10.830> to

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:10.890 
height when you take off you want to

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:13.190 
height when you take off you want to
make<00:01:11.010> sure<00:01:11.040> you<00:01:11.369> jump<00:01:11.760> into<00:01:12.180> it<00:01:12.210> and<00:01:12.360> then<00:01:13.080> you

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:13.200 
make sure you jump into it and then you

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:15.469 
make sure you jump into it and then you
get<00:01:13.710> a<00:01:13.770> good<00:01:14.070> amount<00:01:14.310> of<00:01:14.460> momentum<00:01:14.640> into<00:01:15.450> the

00:01:15.469 --> 00:01:15.479 
get a good amount of momentum into the

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:17.990 
get a good amount of momentum into the
wall<00:01:15.780> to<00:01:16.560> push<00:01:16.950> yourself<00:01:17.100> up<00:01:17.580> so<00:01:17.759> you're<00:01:17.880> going

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:18.000 
wall to push yourself up so you're going

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:20.149 
wall to push yourself up so you're going
to<00:01:18.060> use<00:01:18.180> your<00:01:18.330> momentum<00:01:18.530> jump<00:01:19.530> off<00:01:19.680> and<00:01:20.009> then

00:01:20.149 --> 00:01:20.159 
to use your momentum jump off and then

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:22.070 
to use your momentum jump off and then
your<00:01:20.340> leg<00:01:20.700> off<00:01:20.880> the<00:01:20.909> wall<00:01:21.240> that's<00:01:21.450> waist

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:22.080 
your leg off the wall that's waist

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:25.460 
your leg off the wall that's waist
height<00:01:22.380> to<00:01:23.100> kind<00:01:23.340> of<00:01:23.490> pop<00:01:24.180> yourself<00:01:24.360> up<00:01:24.840> and<00:01:25.380> at

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:25.470 
height to kind of pop yourself up and at

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:27.560 
height to kind of pop yourself up and at
the<00:01:25.619> same<00:01:25.650> time<00:01:26.130> your<00:01:26.820> arms<00:01:27.119> are<00:01:27.240> going<00:01:27.360> to<00:01:27.479> be

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:27.570 
the same time your arms are going to be

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:29.539 
the same time your arms are going to be
right<00:01:27.810> here<00:01:28.140> to<00:01:28.619> give<00:01:28.799> you<00:01:28.890> a<00:01:28.920> little<00:01:29.159> bit<00:01:29.369> of<00:01:29.460> a

00:01:29.539 --> 00:01:29.549 
right here to give you a little bit of a

00:01:29.549 --> 00:01:31.670 
right here to give you a little bit of a
boost<00:01:29.790> or<00:01:30.090> push<00:01:30.360> and<00:01:30.960> at<00:01:31.049> that<00:01:31.259> point<00:01:31.470> all

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:31.680 
boost or push and at that point all

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:33.170 
boost or push and at that point all
you're<00:01:31.860> doing<00:01:32.100> is<00:01:32.220> just<00:01:32.430> pulling<00:01:32.700> your<00:01:32.820> legs

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:33.180 
you're doing is just pulling your legs

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:35.870 
you're doing is just pulling your legs
in<00:01:33.390> as<00:01:33.869> you<00:01:34.079> fly<00:01:34.350> up<00:01:34.530> and<00:01:34.740> land<00:01:35.130> on<00:01:35.310> top<00:01:35.549> of<00:01:35.759> it

00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:35.880 
in as you fly up and land on top of it

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:38.330 
in as you fly up and land on top of it
so<00:01:36.390> kind<00:01:36.630> of<00:01:36.689> like<00:01:36.810> a<00:01:36.869> monkey<00:01:37.320> vault<00:01:37.500> how<00:01:38.280> you

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:38.340 
so kind of like a monkey vault how you

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:40.969 
so kind of like a monkey vault how you
bring<00:01:38.640> your<00:01:38.820> feet<00:01:39.060> up<00:01:39.390> to<00:01:40.229> your<00:01:40.350> chest<00:01:40.650> and

00:01:40.969 --> 00:01:40.979 
bring your feet up to your chest and

00:01:40.979 --> 00:01:43.969 
bring your feet up to your chest and
over<00:01:41.400> the<00:01:41.720> handrail<00:01:42.720> your<00:01:42.899> vaulting<00:01:43.320> it's<00:01:43.829> the

00:01:43.969 --> 00:01:43.979 
over the handrail your vaulting it's the

00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:46.490 
over the handrail your vaulting it's the
same<00:01:44.189> idea<00:01:44.369> only<00:01:44.820> you're<00:01:45.659> using<00:01:45.840> to<00:01:46.079> kick<00:01:46.320> off

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:46.500 
same idea only you're using to kick off

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:47.990 
same idea only you're using to kick off
the<00:01:46.649> wall<00:01:46.829> to<00:01:47.070> help<00:01:47.280> you<00:01:47.399> get<00:01:47.579> more<00:01:47.610> of<00:01:47.820> a<00:01:47.970> boost

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:48.000 
the wall to help you get more of a boost

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:51.289 
the wall to help you get more of a boost
so<00:01:48.990> eventually<00:01:49.290> the<00:01:50.040> same<00:01:50.280> move<00:01:50.579> can<00:01:51.180> be

00:01:51.289 --> 00:01:51.299 
so eventually the same move can be

00:01:51.299 --> 00:01:53.270 
so eventually the same move can be
applied<00:01:51.630> to<00:01:51.659> doing<00:01:52.229> vaults<00:01:52.680> over<00:01:52.829> taller

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:53.280 
applied to doing vaults over taller

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:55.310 
applied to doing vaults over taller
walls<00:01:53.549> you<00:01:53.700> can<00:01:53.759> do<00:01:53.970> a<00:01:54.000> pop<00:01:54.329> up<00:01:54.540> monkey<00:01:55.110> vault

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:55.320 
walls you can do a pop up monkey vault

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:58.039 
walls you can do a pop up monkey vault
or<00:01:55.500> pop<00:01:55.710> up<00:01:55.920> 360<00:01:56.790> vault<00:01:57.210> all<00:01:57.360> sorts<00:01:57.719> of<00:01:57.810> things

00:01:58.039 --> 00:01:58.049 
or pop up 360 vault all sorts of things

00:01:58.049 --> 00:02:00.080 
or pop up 360 vault all sorts of things
so<00:01:58.290> once<00:01:58.770> you<00:01:58.860> start<00:01:59.130> getting<00:01:59.280> the<00:01:59.549> practice

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:00.090 
so once you start getting the practice

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:03.399 
so once you start getting the practice
for<00:02:00.719> the<00:02:00.750> wall<00:02:01.320> pop<00:02:01.590> you<00:02:02.280> can<00:02:02.490> start

00:02:03.399 --> 00:02:03.409 
for the wall pop you can start

00:02:03.409 --> 00:02:06.560 
for the wall pop you can start
practicing<00:02:04.409> the<00:02:04.649> actual<00:02:05.070> jump<00:02:05.399> onto<00:02:05.640> it<00:02:06.000> now

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:06.570 
practicing the actual jump onto it now

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:08.809 
practicing the actual jump onto it now
before<00:02:06.719> you<00:02:06.990> bring<00:02:07.170> both<00:02:07.469> feet<00:02:07.770> up<00:02:07.950> it's<00:02:08.550> safe

00:02:08.809 --> 00:02:08.819 
before you bring both feet up it's safe

00:02:08.819 --> 00:02:10.850 
before you bring both feet up it's safe
to<00:02:09.030> actually<00:02:09.330> practice<00:02:09.539> with<00:02:09.989> one<00:02:10.229> foot<00:02:10.500> first

00:02:10.850 --> 00:02:10.860 
to actually practice with one foot first

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:12.830 
to actually practice with one foot first
so<00:02:11.069> you're<00:02:11.220> going<00:02:11.459> to<00:02:11.489> pop<00:02:11.849> up<00:02:11.879> and<00:02:12.270> then<00:02:12.660> just

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:12.840 
so you're going to pop up and then just

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:14.690 
so you're going to pop up and then just
bring<00:02:13.020> one<00:02:13.349> foot<00:02:13.650> up<00:02:13.770> that's<00:02:14.190> called<00:02:14.370> a<00:02:14.489> crane

00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:14.700 
bring one foot up that's called a crane

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:16.610 
bring one foot up that's called a crane
and<00:02:15.300> you<00:02:15.450> land<00:02:15.629> on<00:02:15.750> one<00:02:15.959> foot<00:02:16.260> while<00:02:16.470> your

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:16.620 
and you land on one foot while your

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:18.650 
and you land on one foot while your
other<00:02:16.650> foot<00:02:17.010> hangs<00:02:17.280> down<00:02:17.550> the<00:02:18.150> next<00:02:18.390> thing<00:02:18.510> you

00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:18.660 
other foot hangs down the next thing you

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:21.080 
other foot hangs down the next thing you
want<00:02:18.840> to<00:02:18.900> do<00:02:19.050> is<00:02:19.319> bring<00:02:19.830> both<00:02:20.099> feet<00:02:20.400> up<00:02:20.610> but

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:21.090 
want to do is bring both feet up but

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:22.729 
want to do is bring both feet up but
bring<00:02:21.330> them<00:02:21.480> to<00:02:21.629> the<00:02:21.750> side<00:02:22.020> so<00:02:22.290> it<00:02:22.410> gives<00:02:22.590> you<00:02:22.709> a

00:02:22.729 --> 00:02:22.739 
bring them to the side so it gives you a

00:02:22.739 --> 00:02:24.380 
bring them to the side so it gives you a
little<00:02:23.040> bit<00:02:23.190> more<00:02:23.400> leverage<00:02:23.640> as<00:02:24.000> you<00:02:24.120> come<00:02:24.360> up

00:02:24.380 --> 00:02:24.390 
little bit more leverage as you come up

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:26.420 
little bit more leverage as you come up
and<00:02:24.780> it's<00:02:25.349> still<00:02:25.470> a<00:02:25.620> little<00:02:25.830> bit<00:02:25.950> easier<00:02:26.370> than

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:26.430 
and it's still a little bit easier than

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:28.040 
and it's still a little bit easier than
bringing<00:02:26.879> both<00:02:27.030> your<00:02:27.300> feet<00:02:27.450> underneath<00:02:27.810> you

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:28.050 
bringing both your feet underneath you

00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:30.199 
bringing both your feet underneath you
then<00:02:28.770> finally<00:02:29.160> as<00:02:29.250> you<00:02:29.280> get<00:02:29.520> that<00:02:29.700> down<00:02:29.970> you

00:02:30.199 --> 00:02:30.209 
then finally as you get that down you

00:02:30.209 --> 00:02:32.720 
then finally as you get that down you
can<00:02:30.480> bring<00:02:30.810> both<00:02:31.080> feet<00:02:31.319> up<00:02:31.530> and<00:02:32.190> have<00:02:32.340> the<00:02:32.489> pop

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:32.730 
can bring both feet up and have the pop

00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:40.410 
can bring both feet up and have the pop
up
