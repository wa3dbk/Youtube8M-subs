 as you can see he has a piece of foami 

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:15.450
 well very thin and what I'm going to do 

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:18.210
 is to put my flower in the center here in the 

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:24.570
 piece of foam and take my black marker 

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:29.210
 and then I will go step by step around 

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:29.210
 from my little paper flower 

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:36.470
 and to trace what will be our 

00:01:33.329 --> 00:01:36.470
 little flower of foami 

00:01:45.460 --> 00:01:50.650
 once the design has been traced 

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:54.720
 then I'm going to take my scissors and I'm going to 

00:01:50.650 --> 00:01:54.720
 cut out the flower 

00:01:59.400 --> 00:02:03.120
 and this flower can be made from 

00:02:01.260 --> 00:02:04.770
 different colors with different 

00:02:03.120 --> 00:02:07.049
 designs 

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:10.519
 not only do they have to follow the same 

00:02:07.049 --> 00:02:10.519
 design or color that I 

00:02:10.670 --> 00:02:16.830
 selected for this modelito here that 

00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:19.560
 let's make today the flower can 

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:22.190
 Use for hair headdresses for 

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:26.660

00:02:39.520 --> 00:02:45.680
 tutorial today I can put a little bit 

00:02:42.520 --> 00:02:48.709
 of glue in the center of my flower 

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:51.260
