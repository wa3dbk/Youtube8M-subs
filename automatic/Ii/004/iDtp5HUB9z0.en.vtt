characters to a Japanese world with
Japanese<00:02:00.689> characters<00:02:01.380> and<00:02:01.560> thus<00:02:01.950> because

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:02.340 
Japanese characters and thus because

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:04.010 
Japanese characters and thus because
they<00:02:02.460> decided<00:02:02.880> to<00:02:02.909> change<00:02:03.000> the<00:02:03.420> setting<00:02:03.719> from

Germany to the Japan new issues came up

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:09.710 
Germany to the Japan new issues came up
especially<00:02:08.039> with<00:02:08.670> the<00:02:08.819> idea<00:02:09.239> that<00:02:09.330> they

00:02:09.710 --> 00:02:09.720 
especially with the idea that they

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:11.920 
especially with the idea that they
wanted<00:02:10.080> to<00:02:10.140> make<00:02:10.470> the<00:02:10.709> story<00:02:11.129> more<00:02:11.250> believable

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:11.930 
wanted to make the story more believable

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:13.400 
wanted to make the story more believable
I<00:02:12.930> mean

I mean

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:15.050 
I mean
I don't<00:02:13.620> understand<00:02:14.070> why<00:02:14.310> they<00:02:14.580> wanted<00:02:14.940> to

00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:15.060 
I don't understand why they wanted to

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:17.120 
I don't understand why they wanted to
make<00:02:15.240> the<00:02:15.450> film<00:02:15.480> more<00:02:15.930> believable<00:02:16.380> since<00:02:16.920> it's

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:17.130 
make the film more believable since it's

00:02:17.130 --> 00:02:20.150 
make the film more believable since it's
you<00:02:17.790> know<00:02:18.350> fiction<00:02:19.350> and<00:02:19.530> thus<00:02:19.890> since

you know fiction and thus since

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:22.190 
you know fiction and thus since
technically<00:02:20.760> all<00:02:20.910> the<00:02:21.030> characters<00:02:21.510> in<00:02:21.720> attack

00:03:00.330 --> 00:03:02.240 
usually not said in Japanese and rumor
has<00:03:00.450> it<00:03:00.630> that<00:03:01.020> they<00:03:01.260> were<00:03:01.380> actually<00:03:01.590> thinking

00:03:02.240 --> 00:03:02.250 
has it that they were actually thinking

00:03:02.250 --> 00:03:04.250 
has it that they were actually thinking
about<00:03:02.490> changing<00:03:03.060> all<00:03:03.240> the<00:03:03.480> characters<00:03:03.960> names

00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:04.260 
about changing all the characters names

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:06.920 
about changing all the characters names
to<00:03:04.800> Japanese<00:03:04.830> names<00:03:05.790> instead<00:03:06.180> of<00:03:06.330> German

00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:06.930 
to Japanese names instead of German

00:03:06.930 --> 00:03:08.780 
to Japanese names instead of German
names<00:03:07.170> but<00:03:07.560> they<00:03:08.040> thought<00:03:08.280> that<00:03:08.340> would<00:03:08.760> be

00:03:08.780 --> 00:03:08.790 
names but they thought that would be

00:03:08.790 --> 00:03:10.700 
names but they thought that would be
going<00:03:09.210> away<00:03:09.600> from<00:03:09.840> the<00:03:09.960> source<00:03:10.170> material<00:03:10.200> too

00:03:10.700 --> 00:03:10.710 
going away from the source material too

00:03:10.710 --> 00:03:14.060 
going away from the source material too
much<00:03:10.950> and<00:03:11.250> so<00:03:11.820> instead<00:03:12.510> they<00:03:13.110> decided<00:03:13.590> to<00:03:13.770> just

00:03:14.060 --> 00:03:14.070 
much and so instead they decided to just

00:03:14.070 --> 00:03:17.840 
much and so instead they decided to just
kind<00:03:14.820> of<00:03:15.090> fuck<00:03:16.020> the<00:03:16.230> hard<00:03:16.470> parts<00:03:16.980> and<00:03:17.130> just<00:03:17.640> get

00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:17.850 
kind of fuck the hard parts and just get

00:03:17.850 --> 00:03:19.160 
kind of fuck the hard parts and just get
rid<00:03:18.000> of<00:03:18.060> Levi<00:03:18.480> altogether

00:03:19.160 --> 00:03:19.170 
rid of Levi altogether

00:03:19.170 --> 00:03:21.860 
rid of Levi altogether
so<00:03:19.410> in<00:03:19.560> conclusion<00:03:20.090> Levi<00:03:21.090> is<00:03:21.150> not<00:03:21.510> going<00:03:21.690> to<00:03:21.750> be

00:03:21.860 --> 00:03:21.870 
so in conclusion Levi is not going to be

00:03:21.870 --> 00:03:24.050 
so in conclusion Levi is not going to be
in<00:03:22.110> the<00:03:22.560> attack<00:03:22.860> on<00:03:22.890> Titan<00:03:23.070> live-action<00:03:23.820> film

00:03:48.170 --> 00:03:48.180 
supposedly German characters because in

00:03:48.180 --> 00:03:50.479 
supposedly German characters because in
the<00:03:48.390> original<00:03:48.900> manga<00:03:49.140> and<00:03:49.530> the<00:03:49.620> anime<00:03:49.709> they're

00:03:50.479 --> 00:03:50.489 
the original manga and the anime they're

00:03:50.489 --> 00:03:52.580 
the original manga and the anime they're
already<00:03:50.910> speaking<00:03:51.480> Japanese<00:03:51.989> anyway<00:03:52.410> they're

00:03:52.580 --> 00:03:52.590 
already speaking Japanese anyway they're

00:03:52.590 --> 00:03:55.310 
already speaking Japanese anyway they're
not<00:03:52.680> speaking<00:03:53.220> German<00:03:53.850> so<00:03:54.120> if<00:03:54.420> you<00:03:54.900> kind<00:03:55.110> of

00:03:55.310 --> 00:03:55.320 
not speaking German so if you kind of

00:03:55.320 --> 00:03:57.320 
not speaking German so if you kind of
look<00:03:55.530> at<00:03:55.709> it<00:03:55.739> if<00:03:56.010> you<00:03:56.280> just<00:03:56.459> ignore<00:03:56.760> the<00:03:57.120> fact

00:03:57.320 --> 00:03:57.330 
look at it if you just ignore the fact

00:03:57.330 --> 00:03:59.540 
look at it if you just ignore the fact
that<00:03:57.450> their<00:03:57.690> names<00:03:57.900> a<00:03:58.110> German<00:03:58.590> they're<00:03:59.130> pretty

00:03:59.540 --> 00:03:59.550 
that their names a German they're pretty

00:03:59.550 --> 00:04:02.120 
that their names a German they're pretty
much<00:03:59.820> Japanese<00:04:00.300> characters<00:04:01.260> and<00:04:01.470> we<00:04:01.890> know

00:04:02.120 --> 00:04:02.130 
much Japanese characters and we know

00:04:02.130 --> 00:04:04.460 
much Japanese characters and we know
that<00:04:02.550> this<00:04:02.730> is<00:04:02.940> a<00:04:03.060> Japanese<00:04:03.780> film<00:04:04.140> so

00:04:04.460 --> 00:04:04.470 
that this is a Japanese film so

00:04:04.470 --> 00:04:07.670 
that this is a Japanese film so
naturally<00:04:05.280> they<00:04:05.910> got<00:04:06.180> Japanese<00:04:06.930> actors<00:04:07.470> right

00:04:07.670 --> 00:04:07.680 
naturally they got Japanese actors right

00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:09.949 
naturally they got Japanese actors right
it's<00:04:07.890> not<00:04:08.100> like<00:04:08.370> the<00:04:08.580> Japanese<00:04:09.090> film<00:04:09.420> creators

00:04:09.949 --> 00:04:09.959 
it's not like the Japanese film creators

00:04:09.959 --> 00:04:12.290 
it's not like the Japanese film creators
are<00:04:10.170> going<00:04:10.410> to<00:04:10.590> bring<00:04:10.830> German<00:04:11.489> actors<00:04:11.910> into<00:04:12.180> it

00:04:12.290 --> 00:04:12.300 
are going to bring German actors into it

00:04:12.300 --> 00:04:15.020 
are going to bring German actors into it
just<00:04:12.840> to<00:04:12.989> keep<00:04:13.260> the<00:04:13.620> kind<00:04:13.950> of<00:04:14.190> you<00:04:14.459> know<00:04:14.580> pure

00:05:05.229 --> 00:05:08.670 
surrounding of Gunkanjima look like the
setting<00:05:05.680> of<00:05:06.240> Germany<00:05:07.240> aka<00:05:07.750> the<00:05:08.080> setting<00:05:08.530> of

setting and the actors rather than the

00:05:16.599 --> 00:05:18.390
