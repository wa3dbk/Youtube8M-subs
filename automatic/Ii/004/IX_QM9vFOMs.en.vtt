the bringing cuttings they teach you how
to<00:00:34.950> graft<00:00:35.719> you<00:00:36.719> can<00:00:36.899> see<00:00:37.200> the<00:00:37.380> graft<00:00:37.680> where<00:00:38.190> I

00:00:38.209 --> 00:00:38.219 
to graft you can see the graft where I

00:00:38.219 --> 00:00:42.440 
to graft you can see the graft where I
cut<00:00:38.640> across<00:00:39.629> and<00:00:40.230> this<00:00:40.860> was<00:00:41.160> the<00:00:41.399> little<00:00:41.670> Scion

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:42.450 
cut across and this was the little Scion

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:44.840 
cut across and this was the little Scion
the<00:00:42.750> cutting<00:00:43.110> that<00:00:43.230> was<00:00:43.410> maybe<00:00:43.649> well<00:00:44.610> you<00:00:44.700> can

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:44.850 
the cutting that was maybe well you can

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:47.540 
the cutting that was maybe well you can
see<00:00:45.059> how<00:00:45.149> long<00:00:45.360> it<00:00:45.539> was<00:00:45.660> about<00:00:46.079> six<00:00:46.620> six<00:00:46.829> inches

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:47.550 
see how long it was about six six inches

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:50.450 
see how long it was about six six inches
long<00:00:47.820> I'm<00:00:48.120> a<00:00:48.360> made<00:00:48.870> a<00:00:48.899> v-shape<00:00:49.710> at<00:00:49.950> the<00:00:50.070> bottom

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:50.460 
long I'm a made a v-shape at the bottom

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:53.270 
long I'm a made a v-shape at the bottom
that<00:00:50.700> would<00:00:51.210> fit<00:00:51.570> into<00:00:51.809> this<00:00:52.110> cleft<00:00:52.559> this<00:00:53.070> is<00:00:53.250> a

00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:53.280 
that would fit into this cleft this is a

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:57.470 
that would fit into this cleft this is a
cleft<00:00:53.699> graft<00:00:54.649> so<00:00:55.649> you<00:00:55.710> cut<00:00:56.190> this<00:00:56.760> thing<00:00:57.030> across

00:00:57.470 --> 00:00:57.480 
cleft graft so you cut this thing across

00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:00.529 
cleft graft so you cut this thing across
and<00:00:57.840> it<00:00:58.379> splits<00:00:58.800> really<00:00:59.070> easily<00:00:59.640> and<00:00:59.910> then<00:01:00.390> you

00:01:00.529 --> 00:01:00.539 
and it splits really easily and then you

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:04.219 
and it splits really easily and then you
shove<00:01:00.870> this<00:01:01.469> in<00:01:01.770> there<00:01:02.100> lining<00:01:02.940> up<00:01:03.149> the<00:01:03.870> bark

00:01:04.219 --> 00:01:04.229 
shove this in there lining up the bark

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:07.010 
shove this in there lining up the bark
layer<00:01:04.580> because<00:01:05.580> it's<00:01:05.760> that<00:01:05.970> little<00:01:06.180> cambian

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:07.020 
layer because it's that little cambian

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:10.340 
layer because it's that little cambian
underneath<00:01:07.799> the<00:01:08.040> bark<00:01:08.280> that<00:01:08.369> is<00:01:09.140> the<00:01:10.140> life

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:10.350 
underneath the bark that is the life

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:15.140 
underneath the bark that is the life
that<00:01:10.710> will<00:01:12.170> join<00:01:13.170> and<00:01:13.650> knit<00:01:14.040> and<00:01:14.250> then<00:01:14.640> I<00:01:14.909> wrap

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:15.150 
that will join and knit and then I wrap

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:17.960 
that will join and knit and then I wrap
this<00:01:15.479> tape<00:01:15.840> around<00:01:16.140> it<00:01:16.380> and<00:01:16.650> keep<00:01:17.490> my<00:01:17.610> fingers

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:17.970 
this tape around it and keep my fingers

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:20.120 
this tape around it and keep my fingers
crossed<00:01:18.060> and<00:01:18.600> this<00:01:18.990> one<00:01:19.229> worked<00:01:19.619> quite<00:01:20.100> well

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:20.130 
crossed and this one worked quite well

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:23.990 
crossed and this one worked quite well
it's<00:01:20.610> got<00:01:20.850> peaches<00:01:21.840> on<00:01:22.200> it<00:01:22.380> the<00:01:23.159> graph<00:01:23.549> takes

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:24.000 
it's got peaches on it the graph takes

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:26.480 
it's got peaches on it the graph takes
about<00:01:24.210> a<00:01:24.330> year<00:01:24.810> I<00:01:24.990> mean<00:01:25.320> a<00:01:25.500> year<00:01:25.799> has<00:01:26.009> to<00:01:26.189> go<00:01:26.310> by

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:26.490 
about a year I mean a year has to go by

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:27.950 
about a year I mean a year has to go by
and<00:01:26.549> then<00:01:26.790> you<00:01:26.909> know<00:01:27.060> you<00:01:27.119> have<00:01:27.450> it<00:01:27.630> they<00:01:27.780> can

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:27.960 
and then you know you have it they can

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:29.390 
and then you know you have it they can
fool<00:01:28.200> you<00:01:28.439> because<00:01:28.740> sometimes<00:01:28.979> they'll

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:29.400 
fool you because sometimes they'll

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:31.219 
fool you because sometimes they'll
sprout<00:01:29.700> leaves<00:01:29.880> and<00:01:30.210> you<00:01:30.270> think<00:01:30.509> oh<00:01:30.659> boy<00:01:30.900> and

00:01:31.219 --> 00:01:31.229 
sprout leaves and you think oh boy and

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:34.039 
sprout leaves and you think oh boy and
then<00:01:31.710> it<00:01:31.860> croaks<00:01:32.210> so<00:01:33.210> after<00:01:33.479> a<00:01:33.509> year<00:01:33.750> you<00:01:33.780> know

00:01:34.039 --> 00:01:34.049 
then it croaks so after a year you know

00:01:34.049 --> 00:01:36.740 
then it croaks so after a year you know
it's<00:01:34.229> taken<00:01:34.710> this<00:01:34.950> i<00:01:35.189> grafted<00:01:35.820> four<00:01:36.329> years<00:01:36.570> ago

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:36.750 
it's taken this i grafted four years ago

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:40.100 
it's taken this i grafted four years ago
probably<00:01:37.159> the<00:01:38.159> rootstock<00:01:38.640> was<00:01:39.420> from<00:01:39.869> a

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:40.110 
probably the rootstock was from a

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:42.889 
probably the rootstock was from a
commercial<00:01:40.560> peach<00:01:41.310> tree<00:01:41.670> I<00:01:41.700> bought<00:01:42.030> that<00:01:42.299> died

00:01:42.889 --> 00:01:42.899 
commercial peach tree I bought that died

00:01:42.899 --> 00:01:45.850 
commercial peach tree I bought that died
the<00:01:43.320> top<00:01:43.590> died<00:01:43.920> and<00:01:44.340> then<00:01:44.460> it<00:01:44.610> sends<00:01:44.939> out<00:01:45.210> these

00:01:45.850 --> 00:01:45.860 
the top died and then it sends out these

00:01:45.860 --> 00:01:48.469 
the top died and then it sends out these
suckers<00:01:46.860> which<00:01:47.310> are<00:01:47.520> still<00:01:47.759> coming<00:01:48.030> up<00:01:48.210> that<00:01:48.450> I

00:01:48.469 --> 00:01:48.479 
suckers which are still coming up that I

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:56.539 
suckers which are still coming up that I
have<00:01:48.659> to<00:01:48.840> clean<00:01:49.170> up<00:01:49.579> but<00:01:50.579> they're<00:01:50.759> handy<00:01:55.549> if

00:01:56.539 --> 00:01:56.549 
have to clean up but they're handy if

00:01:56.549 --> 00:01:58.870 
have to clean up but they're handy if
you<00:01:56.850> were<00:01:57.119> able<00:01:57.390> to<00:01:57.540> find<00:01:57.869> this<00:01:58.079> variety

00:01:58.870 --> 00:01:58.880 
you were able to find this variety

00:01:58.880 --> 00:02:01.670 
you were able to find this variety
commercially<00:01:59.880> and<00:02:00.090> plant<00:02:00.750> the<00:02:00.930> tree<00:02:01.200> it<00:02:01.469> would

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:01.680 
commercially and plant the tree it would

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:03.770 
commercially and plant the tree it would
probably<00:02:01.920> take<00:02:02.130> four<00:02:02.969> or<00:02:03.119> five<00:02:03.329> years<00:02:03.570> to

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:03.780 
probably take four or five years to

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:05.749 
probably take four or five years to
produce<00:02:03.930> and<00:02:04.409> this<00:02:04.590> gets<00:02:04.979> you<00:02:05.159> a<00:02:05.219> leg<00:02:05.430> up<00:02:05.610> on

00:02:05.749 --> 00:02:05.759 
produce and this gets you a leg up on

00:02:05.759 --> 00:02:08.960 
produce and this gets you a leg up on
that<00:02:06.030> it'll<00:02:06.329> it'll<00:02:07.170> produce<00:02:07.439> faster<00:02:07.890> and<00:02:08.459> with

00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:08.970 
that it'll it'll produce faster and with

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:11.780 
that it'll it'll produce faster and with
grafting<00:02:09.569> you<00:02:09.959> have<00:02:10.259> a<00:02:10.289> choice<00:02:10.679> of<00:02:10.950> rootstocks

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:11.790 
grafting you have a choice of rootstocks

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:13.559 
grafting you have a choice of rootstocks
you<00:02:12.390> can<00:02:12.599> get<00:02:12.810> roots

00:02:13.559 --> 00:02:13.569 
you can get roots

00:02:13.569 --> 00:02:15.899 
you can get roots
that<00:02:13.900> work<00:02:14.200> better<00:02:14.409> in<00:02:14.650> clay<00:02:14.890> soils<00:02:15.459> or<00:02:15.730> in

00:02:15.899 --> 00:02:15.909 
that work better in clay soils or in
