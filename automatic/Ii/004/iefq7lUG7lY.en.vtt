 hello everyone with you games creator and in 

00:00:20.190 --> 00:00:24.300
 In this express release, I will quickly reply to 

00:00:22.290 --> 00:00:26.730
 one of the questions that was asked in 

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:28.830
 my group vkontakte and also add 

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:31.890
 you a little example maybe someone 

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:34.260
 useful in the group was asked how 

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:39.180
 create a button so we are with you 

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:40.200
 create a sprite and choose in advance 

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:42.960
 prepared 

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:45.809
 pictures in our folder it will be two kinds 

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:48.330
 buttons start button which will be bright 

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:51.540
 and then maybe it will change color i just 

00:00:48.330 --> 00:00:55.710
 faded made and we will choose the menu 

00:00:51.540 --> 00:00:59.879
 animation and add both of these images 

00:00:55.710 --> 00:01:03.080
 two kinds of buttons our animation is not the same 

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:06.390
 don't forget to go into the animation properties and 

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:09.290
 speed is set to 0 so it does not 

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:09.290
 was playing 

00:01:10.540 --> 00:01:18.680
 Now let's go to the list of events 

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:26.840
 also do not forget to add behavior 

00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:30.530
 our mouse is lt and then our event will be 

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:34.930
 very simple mouse pick if the cursor 

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:40.400
 above the object we select our button 

00:01:34.930 --> 00:01:44.210
 click given and the action to it will be ours 

00:01:40.400 --> 00:01:48.200
 sprite install kadr kadr animation 

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:51.789
 there will be one our faded frame and one more 

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:55.460
 event mouse if the cursor over the object 

00:01:51.789 --> 00:01:58.640
 object our event button is 

00:01:55.460 --> 00:02:01.820
 we invert that is if the cursor is men from 

00:01:58.640 --> 00:02:04.670
 our button on the animation frame 

00:02:01.820 --> 00:02:07.430
 it becomes but 0 on our bright button and 

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:12.380
 let's see what happens now let's 

00:02:07.430 --> 00:02:18.230
 click on the wound layout and no need to explain 

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:20.480
 see for yourself what's going on and in 

00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:23.930
 additions to this release I want to show 

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:28.790
 how to make your cursor let's create 

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:31.579
 new sprite this will be our cursor you 

00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:34.400
 can open already prepared files 

00:02:31.579 --> 00:02:39.500
 image editor but i decided 

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:42.410
 draw our cursor by yourself let it 

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:47.079
 will there be any pointing finger 

00:02:42.410 --> 00:02:47.079
 for example not so important 

00:02:52.900 --> 00:03:00.489
 something more like a finger 

00:02:57.239 --> 00:03:04.709
 now we will fit the size we need 

00:03:00.489 --> 00:03:08.170
 and also we must remember to add 

00:03:04.709 --> 00:03:09.129
 mouse behavior our game will not go to 

00:03:08.170 --> 00:03:12.609
 list of events 

00:03:09.129 --> 00:03:14.980
 in the event list we will add events 

00:03:12.609 --> 00:03:18.209
 Hebrew system 

00:03:14.980 --> 00:03:19.900
 what about every millisecond 

00:03:18.209 --> 00:03:27.220
 add actions 

00:03:19.900 --> 00:03:29.019
 our sprite cursor set the position so 

00:03:27.220 --> 00:03:32.170
 no though let's be a little different 

00:03:29.019 --> 00:03:35.680
 do so in general our sprite 

00:03:32.170 --> 00:03:38.620
 set the x and choose the mouse 

00:03:35.680 --> 00:03:41.230
 that is, it will be its x coordinate will be 

00:03:38.620 --> 00:03:44.109
 fit the coordinates of the mouse and then 

00:03:41.230 --> 00:03:46.019
 same as our sprite install 

00:03:44.109 --> 00:03:50.859
 coordinates by toy 

00:03:46.019 --> 00:03:54.099
 on the mouse igryku that is what it means 

00:03:50.859 --> 00:03:56.290
 that our hand will be set on 

00:03:54.099 --> 00:03:59.859
 mouse cursor and also add a mouse 

00:03:56.290 --> 00:04:01.239
 set the cursor style and nothing is 

00:03:59.859 --> 00:04:06.010
 so we did not see our standard 

00:04:01.239 --> 00:04:09.129
 Hungarian mouse if we check 

00:04:06.010 --> 00:04:12.220
 the browser that we did instead 

00:04:09.129 --> 00:04:13.440
 we now have a standard cursor 

00:04:12.220 --> 00:04:15.970
 little finger 

00:04:13.440 --> 00:04:19.120
 the most observant probably noticed 

00:04:15.970 --> 00:04:21.880
 that our hand drawing was a little behind 

00:04:19.120 --> 00:04:24.039
 from invisible windows of sky mouse is well 

00:04:21.880 --> 00:04:26.500
 all because i use the program to 

00:04:24.039 --> 00:04:29.470
 video capture and when i lose the game 

00:04:26.500 --> 00:04:29.830
 I have fps drops and the game starts 

00:04:29.470 --> 00:04:32.139
 to blunt 

00:04:29.830 --> 00:04:34.090
 so don't worry about it and 

00:04:32.139 --> 00:04:37.860
 themselves were games creator 

00:04:34.090 --> 00:04:37.860
 see you in the next video for now
