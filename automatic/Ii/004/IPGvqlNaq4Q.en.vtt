00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000
 hello or media to the channel e mails of salt 

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:15.050
 yes 

00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:22.780
 well let's start looking at this 

00:00:20.360 --> 00:00:22.780
 base 

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:28.609
 and as you're wrong we're going to scare you 

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:28.609
 our little finger 

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:34.469
 already with the black background we are going to make some 

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:39.110
 flowers I am making some flowers 

00:00:34.469 --> 00:00:39.110
 turquoise white 

00:00:40.210 --> 00:00:43.200
 and roses 

00:00:43.840 --> 00:00:48.970
 and with this glaze we are going to do as 

00:00:46.490 --> 00:00:48.970
 the leaves 

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:59.579
 and with the orange enamel johnny who 

00:00:55.020 --> 00:01:02.370
 enamel orange 222 6 to make the 

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:04.360
 little dots in the middle of the colored flowers 

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:06.550
 White 

00:01:04.360 --> 00:01:08.880
 and we're going to put white dots in the 

00:01:06.550 --> 00:01:12.020
 other flowers 

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:12.020
 how are you doing well 

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:21.620
 then square studs I'm going to 

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:21.620
 apply with resin 

00:01:22.630 --> 00:01:25.890
 in our little finger 

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:31.820
 here you are seeing that I am doing it 

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:35.370
 like a cross because according to what this 

00:01:31.820 --> 00:01:37.290
 do as in the form of a cross but the 

00:01:35.370 --> 00:01:40.350
 you have not seen anything else in a 

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:42.740
 line and it made me very beautiful and well 

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:42.740
 I left it 

00:01:44.140 --> 00:01:47.400
 It is very easy 

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:54.439
 and this this but I left a piece 

00:01:52.729 --> 00:01:59.710
 and then the only thing they have to do is 

00:01:54.439 --> 00:01:59.710
 file the surplus or cut it 

00:02:00.100 --> 00:02:03.990
 and this is already finished 

00:02:05.210 --> 00:02:09.649
 on our middle and ring finger with 

00:02:07.369 --> 00:02:11.830
 painting we click beings of calaveritas 

00:02:09.649 --> 00:02:14.170
 or catrinas 

00:02:11.830 --> 00:02:18.510
 and they have to do it first they're going to be 

00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:18.510
 two circles that are going to be the eyes 

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:38.000
 and in this way they will be as united 

00:02:35.830 --> 00:02:39.840
 lines 

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:43.590
 curved 

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:47.010
 curves as you say 

00:02:43.590 --> 00:02:49.739
 and to assure them what are the 

00:02:47.010 --> 00:02:51.420
 teeth but the truth here commits a 

00:02:49.739 --> 00:02:54.709
 error that in the end 

00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:54.709
 he took it off 

00:02:54.780 --> 00:03:00.319
 because I forgot to put his nose 

00:02:57.150 --> 00:03:00.319
 but you are going to realize 

00:03:01.760 --> 00:03:09.190
 with this turquoise enamel we are going to make 

00:03:05.450 --> 00:03:12.130
 like the details of this skull 

00:03:09.190 --> 00:03:14.460
 with this green and with this rose with 

00:03:12.130 --> 00:03:14.460
 glitter 

00:03:15.880 --> 00:03:23.540
 and here we are going to put as 

00:03:20.960 --> 00:03:26.420
 second I see him in the shape of a drop 

00:03:23.540 --> 00:03:29.520
 inverted and with this green color we are going to 

00:03:26.420 --> 00:03:34.110
 make him like eyebrows 

00:03:29.520 --> 00:03:35.700
 and with white acrylic paint le x de 

00:03:34.110 --> 00:03:37.040
 this had gone wrong and everything 

00:03:35.700 --> 00:03:40.340
 perfect 

00:03:37.040 --> 00:03:44.680
 and well there I put little dots in color 

00:03:40.340 --> 00:03:44.680
 turquoise and here the ball 

00:03:48.600 --> 00:03:54.410
 and we put turquoise points too 

00:03:51.570 --> 00:03:54.410
 there on the sides 

00:03:58.270 --> 00:04:03.460
 and with this pointer we are going to do as 

00:04:01.600 --> 00:04:06.450
 the teeth with acrylic paint or 

00:04:03.460 --> 00:04:06.450
 white enamel 

00:04:06.830 --> 00:04:13.310
 and the thumb we're going to pave this 

00:04:09.920 --> 00:04:17.740
 fingernail also as the index finger as the 

00:04:13.310 --> 00:04:17.740
 sorry with the little finger 

00:04:17.799 --> 00:04:22.479
 and we're going to add the sixth one but before 

00:04:20.650 --> 00:04:25.330
 that the enamel is that here we are 

00:04:22.479 --> 00:04:27.930
 putting a cock layer of being 

00:04:25.330 --> 00:04:27.930
 protective 

00:04:31.470 --> 00:04:35.150
 this is a simple top coat 

00:04:39.540 --> 00:04:45.180
 in the studs it is very important that 

00:04:41.730 --> 00:04:48.330
 can put two layers because it 

00:04:45.180 --> 00:04:50.320
 they do not wash when we wash our hands or 

00:04:48.330 --> 00:04:52.300
 things like that 

00:04:50.320 --> 00:04:55.270
 well this step ignore not because 

00:04:52.300 --> 00:04:57.040
 end it's over from kid letter you 

00:04:55.270 --> 00:04:58.960
 remove this because I really do not like it 

00:04:57.040 --> 00:05:01.950
 the result 

00:04:58.960 --> 00:05:05.280
 how it see 

00:05:01.950 --> 00:05:07.650
 and added an atom some flowers like that to 

00:05:05.280 --> 00:05:09.720
 the eyes because I thought it looked very 

00:05:07.650 --> 00:05:11.540
 simple and I really liked the 

00:05:09.720 --> 00:05:14.450
 final result 

00:05:11.540 --> 00:05:18.310
 and so it was good subscribe share 

00:05:14.450 --> 00:05:18.310
