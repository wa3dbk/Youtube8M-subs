00:04:05.459 --> 00:04:07.520 
low bun but I think this is kind of what
I<00:04:05.520> would<00:04:05.640> look<00:04:05.880> like<00:04:05.940> a<00:04:06.390> little<00:04:06.750> bit<00:04:06.870> if<00:04:07.080> I<00:04:07.230> got

00:04:07.520 --> 00:04:07.530 
I would look like a little bit if I got

00:04:07.530 --> 00:04:10.520 
I would look like a little bit if I got
a<00:04:07.770> pixie<00:04:08.550> cut<00:04:08.790> I<00:04:09.450> mean<00:04:09.810> obviously<00:04:09.959> it'd<00:04:10.350> be<00:04:10.500> a

00:04:10.520 --> 00:04:10.530 
a pixie cut I mean obviously it'd be a

00:04:10.530 --> 00:04:11.780 
a pixie cut I mean obviously it'd be a
little<00:04:10.739> different<00:04:11.010> because<00:04:11.190> I'd<00:04:11.400> have<00:04:11.550> liked

00:04:11.780 --> 00:04:11.790 
little different because I'd have liked

00:04:11.790 --> 00:04:13.970 
little different because I'd have liked
the<00:04:11.940> layers<00:04:12.180> falling<00:04:12.810> down<00:04:13.019> because

00:04:13.970 --> 00:04:13.980 
the layers falling down because

00:04:13.980 --> 00:04:16.370 
the layers falling down because
everything's<00:04:14.370> like<00:04:14.550> slicked<00:04:14.880> back<00:04:14.970> but<00:04:15.660> it

00:04:16.370 --> 00:04:16.380 
everything's like slicked back but it

00:04:16.380 --> 00:04:18.800 
everything's like slicked back but it
kind<00:04:16.799> of<00:04:16.890> looked<00:04:17.100> like<00:04:17.190> this<00:04:17.549> what<00:04:18.180> I<00:04:18.209> want<00:04:18.540> um

00:04:18.800 --> 00:04:18.810 
kind of looked like this what I want um

00:04:18.810 --> 00:04:20.780 
kind of looked like this what I want um
I<00:04:19.080> think<00:04:19.440> this<00:04:19.739> is<00:04:19.799> what<00:04:20.070> it<00:04:20.160> looked<00:04:20.400> like<00:04:20.430> if<00:04:20.669> i

00:04:20.780 --> 00:04:20.790 
I think this is what it looked like if i

00:04:20.790 --> 00:04:24.050 
I think this is what it looked like if i
style<00:04:21.120> it<00:04:21.299> like<00:04:21.480> just<00:04:21.600> down<00:04:22.380> flat<00:04:22.979> but<00:04:23.789> there

00:04:24.050 --> 00:04:24.060 
style it like just down flat but there

00:04:24.060 --> 00:04:25.580 
style it like just down flat but there
was<00:04:24.180> a<00:04:24.210> picture<00:04:24.600> in<00:04:24.750> mind

00:04:25.580 --> 00:04:25.590 
was a picture in mind

00:04:25.590 --> 00:04:28.850 
was a picture in mind
by<00:04:25.740> ginnifer<00:04:26.280> goodwin<00:04:26.639> that<00:04:27.240> I<00:04:27.270> saw<00:04:27.860> I'll

00:04:28.850 --> 00:04:28.860 
by ginnifer goodwin that I saw I'll

00:04:28.860 --> 00:04:31.100 
by ginnifer goodwin that I saw I'll
insert<00:04:29.280> a<00:04:29.370> picture<00:04:29.520> right<00:04:29.760> now<00:04:29.940> but<00:04:30.720> that's

00:04:31.100 --> 00:04:31.110 
insert a picture right now but that's

00:04:31.110 --> 00:04:33.650 
insert a picture right now but that's
how<00:04:31.470> I<00:04:31.500> want<00:04:32.100> my<00:04:32.669> hair<00:04:32.940> like<00:04:33.090> it<00:04:33.240> by<00:04:33.360> how<00:04:33.510> it

00:04:33.650 --> 00:04:33.660 
how I want my hair like it by how it

00:04:33.660 --> 00:04:35.210 
how I want my hair like it by how it
takes<00:04:33.840> a<00:04:33.930> cut<00:04:34.080> I<00:04:34.199> want<00:04:34.410> to<00:04:34.530> style<00:04:34.770> it<00:04:34.919> so<00:04:35.070> it's

00:04:35.210 --> 00:04:35.220 
takes a cut I want to style it so it's

00:04:35.220 --> 00:04:37.790 
takes a cut I want to style it so it's
like<00:04:35.430> a<00:04:35.610> little<00:04:35.880> funky<00:04:36.419> and<00:04:36.570> spunky<00:04:37.080> and<00:04:37.290> just

00:04:37.790 --> 00:04:37.800 
like a little funky and spunky and just

00:04:37.800 --> 00:04:39.350 
like a little funky and spunky and just
a<00:04:37.860> little<00:04:38.100> more<00:04:38.190> on<00:04:38.310> the<00:04:38.340> edgy<00:04:38.729> side<00:04:38.760> and<00:04:39.300> I

00:04:39.350 --> 00:04:39.360 
a little more on the edgy side and I

00:04:39.360 --> 00:04:43.370 
a little more on the edgy side and I
think<00:04:39.660> I<00:04:39.870> think<00:04:40.620> it's<00:04:40.770> like<00:04:42.229> kind<00:04:43.229> of<00:04:43.290> a

00:04:43.370 --> 00:04:43.380 
think I think it's like kind of a

00:04:43.380 --> 00:04:45.080 
think I think it's like kind of a
contrast<00:04:43.830> because<00:04:44.010> i<00:04:44.190> don't<00:04:44.430> have<00:04:44.490> an<00:04:44.729> edgy

00:04:45.080 --> 00:04:45.090 
contrast because i don't have an edgy

00:04:45.090 --> 00:04:48.020 
contrast because i don't have an edgy
looking<00:04:45.389> face<00:04:45.600> i<00:04:45.750> have<00:04:45.930> like<00:04:46.080> a<00:04:46.310> simple<00:04:47.310> sweet

00:04:48.020 --> 00:04:48.030 
looking face i have like a simple sweet

00:04:48.030 --> 00:04:49.730 
looking face i have like a simple sweet
like<00:04:48.330> girl-next-door<00:04:48.720> type<00:04:49.260> of<00:04:49.380> face<00:04:49.560> at

00:04:49.730 --> 00:04:49.740 
like girl-next-door type of face at

00:04:49.740 --> 00:04:51.830 
like girl-next-door type of face at
least<00:04:49.770> that's<00:04:50.100> what<00:04:50.280> I<00:04:50.310> think<00:04:50.430> and<00:04:50.940> so<00:04:51.630> if<00:04:51.750> I

00:04:51.830 --> 00:04:51.840 
least that's what I think and so if I

00:04:51.840 --> 00:04:54.050 
least that's what I think and so if I
had<00:04:51.990> like<00:04:52.110> some<00:04:52.410> and<00:04:52.650> like<00:04:53.160> an<00:04:53.250> edgy<00:04:53.610> haircut<00:04:54.030> I

00:04:54.050 --> 00:04:54.060 
had like some and like an edgy haircut I

00:04:54.060 --> 00:04:55.730 
had like some and like an edgy haircut I
think<00:04:54.330> it'd<00:04:54.419> be<00:04:54.540> like<00:04:54.660> a<00:04:54.720> nice<00:04:54.960> contrast<00:04:55.260> I

00:04:55.730 --> 00:04:55.740 
think it'd be like a nice contrast I

00:04:55.740 --> 00:04:57.920 
think it'd be like a nice contrast I
don't<00:04:56.010> know<00:04:56.100> I<00:04:56.330> really<00:04:57.330> like<00:04:57.600> this<00:04:57.750> makeup
