what<00:01:31.069> all<00:01:31.189> these<00:01:31.340> do<00:01:31.749> but<00:01:32.749> rental<00:01:33.259> I'm<00:01:33.409> not

00:01:33.580 --> 00:01:33.590 
what all these do but rental I'm not

exactly<00:01:34.100> sure<00:01:34.399> what<00:01:34.429> that<00:01:34.609> does<00:01:35.030> I<00:01:35.299> haven't

00:01:36.279 --> 00:01:36.289 
exactly sure what that does I haven't

00:01:36.289 --> 00:01:38.080 
exactly sure what that does I haven't
tested<00:01:36.409> out<00:01:36.710> yet<00:01:36.950> I<00:01:36.979> think<00:01:37.340> what<00:01:37.490> it<00:01:37.609> does<00:01:37.639> is

00:01:38.080 --> 00:01:38.090 
tested out yet I think what it does is

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:39.879 
tested out yet I think what it does is
it<00:01:38.630> reminds<00:01:38.990> the<00:01:39.200> tape<00:01:39.409> after<00:01:39.619> you're

00:01:39.879 --> 00:01:39.889 
it reminds the tape after you're

00:01:39.889 --> 00:01:42.309 
it reminds the tape after you're
finished<00:01:40.039> watching<00:01:40.399> it<00:01:40.840> which<00:01:41.840> is<00:01:42.049> pretty

00:01:42.309 --> 00:01:42.319 
finished watching it which is pretty

00:01:42.319 --> 00:01:44.859 
finished watching it which is pretty
cool<00:01:42.789> there's<00:01:43.789> the<00:01:43.999> clock<00:01:44.240> the<00:01:44.450> clock<00:01:44.479> only

00:01:44.859 --> 00:01:44.869 
cool there's the clock the clock only

00:01:44.869 --> 00:01:50.830 
cool there's the clock the clock only
goes<00:01:45.139> from<00:01:45.459> 1993<00:01:46.459> to<00:01:46.639> 2007<00:01:47.479> I<00:01:47.719> think<00:01:48.429> so<00:01:49.429> I<00:01:49.840> just

00:01:50.830 --> 00:01:50.840 
goes from 1993 to 2007 I think so I just

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:54.840 
goes from 1993 to 2007 I think so I just
have<00:01:51.020> it<00:01:51.139> set<00:01:51.350> for<00:01:51.380> 2002<00:01:53.139> high-quality<00:01:54.139> system

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:54.850 
have it set for 2002 high-quality system

00:01:54.850 --> 00:01:57.699 
have it set for 2002 high-quality system
notice<00:01:55.850> it<00:01:55.999> doesn't<00:01:56.119> claim<00:01:56.450> to<00:01:56.509> be<00:01:56.840> for<00:01:57.469> head

00:01:57.699 --> 00:01:57.709 
notice it doesn't claim to be for head

00:01:57.709 --> 00:02:02.199 
notice it doesn't claim to be for head
when<00:01:57.950> it's<00:01:58.069> actually<00:01:58.310> not<00:02:00.399> maybe<00:02:01.399> let's<00:02:01.579> try
