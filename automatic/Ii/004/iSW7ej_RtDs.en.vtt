underneath<00:00:28.500> this<00:00:29.250> glass<00:00:29.609> top<00:00:29.970> there<00:00:30.390> are

00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:30.420 
underneath this glass top there are

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:31.999 
underneath this glass top there are
several<00:00:30.510> elements<00:00:31.080> they're<00:00:31.769> called

00:00:31.999 --> 00:00:32.009 
several elements they're called

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:34.610 
several elements they're called
induction<00:00:32.399> coils<00:00:33.030> and<00:00:33.360> what<00:00:33.570> they<00:00:33.780> do<00:00:33.840> is<00:00:34.380> they

00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:34.620 
induction coils and what they do is they

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:36.889 
induction coils and what they do is they
actually<00:00:34.829> generate<00:00:35.550> a<00:00:35.579> magnetic<00:00:36.239> field<00:00:36.540> that

00:00:36.889 --> 00:00:36.899 
actually generate a magnetic field that

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:39.290 
actually generate a magnetic field that
works<00:00:37.290> directly<00:00:37.800> with<00:00:37.920> the<00:00:38.340> iron<00:00:38.579> or<00:00:38.940> steel

00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:39.300 
works directly with the iron or steel

content<00:00:40.020> of<00:00:40.200> the<00:00:40.440> pot<00:00:40.649> itself<00:00:41.040> so<00:00:41.969> instead<00:00:42.540> of

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:42.690 
content of the pot itself so instead of

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:44.690 
content of the pot itself so instead of
heating<00:00:42.989> the<00:00:43.469> element<00:00:43.890> and<00:00:44.129> will<00:00:44.280> actually

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:44.700 
heating the element and will actually

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:46.580 
heating the element and will actually
heat<00:00:44.969> the<00:00:45.210> pot<00:00:45.480> and<00:00:45.809> that's<00:00:45.930> what<00:00:46.200> heats<00:00:46.379> the

00:00:46.580 --> 00:00:46.590 
heat the pot and that's what heats the

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:49.250 
heat the pot and that's what heats the
food<00:00:46.800> Wow<00:00:47.820> oh<00:00:47.969> the<00:00:48.180> doubler<00:00:48.600> building<00:00:48.960> burned

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:49.260 
food Wow oh the doubler building burned

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:51.920 
food Wow oh the doubler building burned
that's<00:00:49.649> amazing<00:00:50.430> it<00:00:50.730> is<00:00:50.789> isn't<00:00:51.180> it<00:00:51.300> one<00:00:51.719> of<00:00:51.750> the

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:51.930 
that's amazing it is isn't it one of the

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:53.209 
that's amazing it is isn't it one of the
things<00:00:51.989> that<00:00:52.289> you're<00:00:52.440> going<00:00:52.559> to<00:00:52.649> define<00:00:53.010> is

00:00:53.209 --> 00:00:53.219 
things that you're going to define is

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:56.810 
things that you're going to define is
that<00:00:53.760> things<00:00:54.000> will<00:00:54.210> heat<00:00:54.570> in<00:00:55.190> 50%<00:00:56.190> half<00:00:56.430> the

00:00:56.810 --> 00:00:56.820 
that things will heat in 50% half the

00:00:56.820 --> 00:00:59.209 
that things will heat in 50% half the
time<00:00:57.059> that<00:00:57.719> they<00:00:57.899> would<00:00:58.050> normally<00:00:58.230> take<00:00:58.620> so<00:00:59.100> it

00:00:59.209 --> 00:00:59.219 
time that they would normally take so it

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:02.150 
time that they would normally take so it
uses<00:00:59.550> less<00:00:59.730> energy<00:01:00.020> yes<00:01:01.020> it<00:01:01.230> does<00:01:01.440> induction

00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:02.160 
uses less energy yes it does induction

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:05.299 
uses less energy yes it does induction
cooking<00:01:02.609> is<00:01:03.290> 90%<00:01:04.290> efficient<00:01:04.710> you<00:01:04.830> use<00:01:05.040> less

00:01:05.299 --> 00:01:05.309 
cooking is 90% efficient you use less

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:07.070 
cooking is 90% efficient you use less
electricity<00:01:05.460> which<00:01:06.390> is<00:01:06.420> great<00:01:06.750> for<00:01:06.990> the

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:07.080 
electricity which is great for the

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:09.200 
electricity which is great for the
ecology<00:01:07.619> but<00:01:08.010> it's<00:01:08.189> also<00:01:08.340> great<00:01:08.700> because<00:01:08.760> you

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:09.210 
ecology but it's also great because you

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:11.870 
ecology but it's also great because you
get<00:01:09.390> less<00:01:09.600> of<00:01:09.720> an<00:01:09.869> electric<00:01:10.260> bill<00:01:10.670> let<00:01:11.670> me<00:01:11.729> show

00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:11.880 
get less of an electric bill let me show

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:14.870 
get less of an electric bill let me show
you<00:01:11.970> something<00:01:12.299> because<00:01:12.600> of<00:01:13.260> induction<00:01:13.950> it

00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:14.880 
you something because of induction it

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:17.450 
you something because of induction it
only<00:01:15.180> heats<00:01:15.600> the<00:01:15.960> pan<00:01:16.259> not<00:01:16.950> the<00:01:17.189> surface

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:17.460 
only heats the pan not the surface

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:19.730 
only heats the pan not the surface
that's<00:01:18.299> why<00:01:18.450> I<00:01:18.479> can<00:01:18.780> put<00:01:18.960> my<00:01:19.110> hand<00:01:19.320> right<00:01:19.409> there

00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:19.740 
that's why I can put my hand right there

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:21.800 
that's why I can put my hand right there
next<00:01:19.950> to<00:01:20.100> it<00:01:20.220> and<00:01:20.340> not<00:01:20.430> burn<00:01:20.640> myself<00:01:20.880> that's

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:21.810 
next to it and not burn myself that's

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:23.179 
next to it and not burn myself that's
important<00:01:22.320> that's<00:01:22.409> one<00:01:22.590> of<00:01:22.680> the<00:01:22.770> safety

00:01:23.179 --> 00:01:23.189 
important that's one of the safety

00:01:23.189 --> 00:01:25.520 
important that's one of the safety
features<00:01:23.520> as<00:01:23.670> you<00:01:24.030> can<00:01:24.180> see<00:01:24.420> this<00:01:24.840> induction

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:25.530 
features as you can see this induction

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:28.070 
features as you can see this induction

remember<00:01:29.040> everything<00:01:29.400> from<00:01:29.670> one<00:01:30.090> which<00:01:30.360> is

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:30.540 
remember everything from one which is

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:32.539 
remember everything from one which is
the<00:01:30.659> keep<00:01:30.869> warm<00:01:31.110> all<00:01:31.439> the<00:01:31.619> way<00:01:31.740> to<00:01:31.799> 12<00:01:32.189> which<00:01:32.430> is

00:01:32.539 --> 00:01:32.549 
the keep warm all the way to 12 which is

00:01:32.549 --> 00:01:35.240 
the keep warm all the way to 12 which is
a<00:01:32.579> deep<00:01:32.850> frying<00:01:33.090> and<00:01:33.420> it's<00:01:33.659> very<00:01:34.380> very<00:01:34.680> precise

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:35.250 
a deep frying and it's very very precise

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:38.450 
a deep frying and it's very very precise
like<00:01:35.670> gas<00:01:36.350> any<00:01:37.350> adjustments<00:01:37.950> in<00:01:38.070> temperature

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:38.460 
like gas any adjustments in temperature

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:41.300 
like gas any adjustments in temperature
are<00:01:38.850> instantaneous<00:01:39.600> but<00:01:40.409> there's<00:01:40.920> no<00:01:41.040> hot

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:41.310 
are instantaneous but there's no hot

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:44.300 
are instantaneous but there's no hot
spots<00:01:41.490> so<00:01:42.030> it's<00:01:42.150> a<00:01:42.240> very<00:01:42.479> uniform<00:01:42.960> heat<00:01:43.310> you

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:44.310 
spots so it's a very uniform heat you

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:46.069 
spots so it's a very uniform heat you
know<00:01:44.430> tell<00:01:44.700> me<00:01:44.729> so<00:01:45.060> far<00:01:45.270> you've<00:01:45.570> done<00:01:45.600> all<00:01:45.930> the

00:01:46.069 --> 00:01:46.079 
know tell me so far you've done all the

00:01:46.079 --> 00:01:48.440 
know tell me so far you've done all the
work<00:01:46.229> how<00:01:46.740> about<00:01:46.770> I<00:01:47.189> do<00:01:47.250> the<00:01:47.549> cleanup<00:01:47.790> I<00:01:48.149> think

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:48.450 
work how about I do the cleanup I think

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:50.539 
work how about I do the cleanup I think
I<00:01:48.540> definitely<00:01:48.750> got<00:01:48.990> the<00:01:49.229> easier<00:01:49.590> job<00:01:49.860> well

00:01:50.539 --> 00:01:50.549 
I definitely got the easier job well

00:01:50.549 --> 00:01:51.859 
I definitely got the easier job well
normally<00:01:50.970> I'd<00:01:51.090> agree<00:01:51.119> with<00:01:51.450> you<00:01:51.630> but<00:01:51.810> you

normally I'd agree with you but you

00:01:51.869 --> 00:01:53.810 
normally I'd agree with you but you
forgot<00:01:52.229> something<00:01:52.680> remember<00:01:53.130> this<00:01:53.280> cooktop

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:53.820
