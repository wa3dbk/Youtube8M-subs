going to dam it off once activated it

00:00:41.290 --> 00:00:42.930 
going to dam it off once activated it
will<00:00:41.350> spread<00:00:41.860> across<00:00:42.010> the<00:00:42.220> water<00:00:42.610> and<00:00:42.820> you

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:42.940

60-second timer and then we'll activate

00:00:55.560 --> 00:00:57.930 
60-second timer and then we'll activate
okay<00:00:56.560> so<00:00:56.620> now<00:00:57.010> we're<00:00:57.160> at<00:00:57.280> the<00:00:57.400> activation

00:00:57.930 --> 00:00:57.940 
okay so now we're at the activation

00:00:57.940 --> 00:01:00.630

00:01:00.630 --> 00:01:00.640 
stage we've waited that 60 seconds for

00:01:00.640 --> 00:01:07.860 
stage we've waited that 60 seconds for

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:10.840 
this is a thicker film so it will have

00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:18.540 
this is a thicker film so it will have
that<00:01:11.110> have<00:01:11.680> a<00:01:11.710> little<00:01:12.070> more<00:01:12.370> activation<00:01:17.550> as
