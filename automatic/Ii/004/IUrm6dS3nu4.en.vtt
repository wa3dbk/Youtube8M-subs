00:00:12.440 --> 00:00:19.800
 hello everyone got to 90 

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:23.009
 here I am guys back with nuclear 

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:25.020
 agazzi on the new map pack you don't 

00:00:23.009 --> 00:00:26.880
 I remember the name to come forward 

00:00:25.020 --> 00:00:30.630
 I do not remember but I know that the blue 

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:32.520
 with the v, however, I don't remember the name la 

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:35.270
 a little difficult pronunciation 

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:39.210
 oh well anyway this is the rush map 

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:42.210
 that goes well let's say it's a field from 

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:45.620
 paintball as you can see pine pine 

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:48.450
 of green paint paint 

00:00:45.620 --> 00:00:50.700
 let's say that regarding the first ones 

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:55.050
 impressions on this new map pack 

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:58.829
 I would say that I am quite positive 

00:00:55.050 --> 00:01:01.440
 played on all the maps and I have to 

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:06.810
 say that I liked them all 

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:08.790
 the only right thing we say let's say 

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:12.060
 in general that all the four 

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:14.420
 Multiplayer maps are very small 

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:17.400
 so let's say so then there is the remake of 

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:21.360
 black ops summit one that we say that 

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:22.830
 the biggest if you can say so 

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:27.659
 there are really three more years 

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:29.880
 small and therefore the bad thing of 

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:31.890
 these maps that the sponsors or facts 

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:35.370
 really very bad there is look for example 

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:38.010
 now they all end up front and I'm there 

00:01:35.370 --> 00:01:40.940
 understood there is they flow in front of me 

00:01:38.010 --> 00:01:44.540
 I repeated the fact a little bit mischievously 

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:46.740
 you can very well do sponky there indeed 

00:01:44.540 --> 00:01:51.110
 honestly I found some place 

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:53.450
 good for let's say so 

00:01:51.110 --> 00:01:56.150
 close the enemy background and then 

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:58.040
 play the game better then play 

00:01:56.150 --> 00:02:00.440
 really about the map 

00:01:58.040 --> 00:02:02.570
 zombies have not played there 

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:04.700
 personally to that on the latter 

00:02:02.570 --> 00:02:08.240
 but I've heard from friends about it 

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:12.170
 they had sincerely said they have 

00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:14.510
 added many things which is a good one 

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:16.550
 zombie map and then talked about a 

00:02:14.510 --> 00:02:20.060
 of a giant of three meters they have me 

00:02:16.550 --> 00:02:23.240
 said so at least that there is a giant who 

00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:25.490
 kind of you have to give rise to that kind 

00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:28.400
 what alcohol does not type i 

00:02:25.490 --> 00:02:30.890
 sweets something like him who can 

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:34.040
 open the doors that kills the zombies a 

00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:35.810
 bit of things so i think in these 

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:37.010
 days anyway I'll play it eventually 

00:02:35.810 --> 00:02:40.940
 how was zombie then 

00:02:37.010 --> 00:02:43.190
 maybe who knows, I could even do one 

00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:46.040
 gameplay above to take it on the channel 

00:02:43.190 --> 00:02:48.170
 which then was never brought one of 

00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:51.709
 zombies you don't know just how to play though 

00:02:48.170 --> 00:02:56.350
 zombies even if he admits they are not really 

00:02:51.709 --> 00:02:59.239
 passionate about the latter anyway 

00:02:56.350 --> 00:03:02.630
 opinions on then on this map I must say 

00:02:59.239 --> 00:03:05.600
 and indeed that's another thing I have to say 

00:03:02.630 --> 00:03:10.549
 which on all the maps I found 

00:03:05.600 --> 00:03:13.100
 a great many is of bleach that is why 

00:03:10.549 --> 00:03:17.239
 knew what the meaning of riad is 

00:03:13.100 --> 00:03:19.850
 sorry ik means places where you do 

00:03:17.239 --> 00:03:22.670
 he only sees his head so let's say to 99 

00:03:19.850 --> 00:03:24.980
 percent win fights because vi 

00:03:22.670 --> 00:03:28.400
 see your head and you can 

00:03:24.980 --> 00:03:30.440
 shoot quietly is full of po 

00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:33.830
 precisely these costs here 

00:03:30.440 --> 00:03:35.470
 so if you know how to exploit these 

00:03:33.830 --> 00:03:39.070
 places here 

00:03:35.470 --> 00:03:42.840
 we say that the place will be very 

00:03:39.070 --> 00:03:45.730
 much easier to do because 

00:03:42.840 --> 00:03:48.310
 however I repeat the nightwish is a lot 

00:03:45.730 --> 00:03:49.210
 difficult to die 

00:03:48.310 --> 00:03:50.500
 to me however that was 

00:03:49.210 --> 00:03:53.530
 however it was quite as fast as 

00:03:50.500 --> 00:03:56.260
 you see done with more or less with the m8 

00:03:53.530 --> 00:03:58.600
 because it doesn't really aim to do the 

00:03:56.260 --> 00:04:02.110
 nuclear with with this weapon but I wanted to 

00:03:58.600 --> 00:04:03.700
 to make a nuclear enough used however on 

00:04:02.110 --> 00:04:08.470
 for down we can say I did it with 

00:04:03.700 --> 00:04:12.250
 this m8 that has become my weapon 

00:04:08.470 --> 00:04:15.340
 weapon sincerely preferred because it already is 

00:04:12.250 --> 00:04:17.080
 just beautiful if you're the six type races 

00:04:15.340 --> 00:04:18.730
 all four hits with four 

00:04:17.080 --> 00:04:21.459
 blows then we say that unfortunately at 

00:04:18.730 --> 00:04:23.320
 that the enemy dies even though it is a lot 

00:04:21.459 --> 00:04:27.520
 difficult to catch him with all four 

00:04:23.320 --> 00:04:29.740
 blows but we say that I am 

00:04:27.520 --> 00:04:32.680
 very well from afar is the weapon 

00:04:29.740 --> 00:04:35.890
 better than the game, we say even 

00:04:32.680 --> 00:04:37.360
 thanks to the ring fall, however, it is really 

00:04:35.890 --> 00:04:39.610
 a beast 

00:04:37.360 --> 00:04:43.470
 the true equipped with the mini nomino 

00:04:39.610 --> 00:04:46.060
 soccer reflex is adjustable is what else 

00:04:43.470 --> 00:04:49.990
 and quick extraction if you don't want to 

00:04:46.060 --> 00:04:51.850
 own best accessories for per 

00:04:49.990 --> 00:04:54.940
 that weapon however boys the v 

00:04:51.850 --> 00:04:58.090
 I called tomorrow I indeed bring us 

00:04:54.940 --> 00:05:00.940
 tomorrow even if this afternoon me 

00:04:58.090 --> 00:05:03.700
 I'll bring another core up 

00:05:00.940 --> 00:05:06.580
 another between the dlc map 

00:05:03.700 --> 00:05:09.720
 I greet you guys and we get the 

00:05:06.580 --> 00:05:09.720
 next nice video
