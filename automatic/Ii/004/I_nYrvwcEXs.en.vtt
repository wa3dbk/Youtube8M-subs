this machine thing anyways part in the

00:00:40.059 --> 00:00:42.209 
this machine thing anyways part in the
rain<00:00:40.329> because<00:00:40.600> i<00:00:40.809> can't<00:00:41.140> change<00:00:41.440> that<00:00:41.710> but<00:00:41.769> the

and you're not done now take any other

00:01:05.470 --> 00:01:09.240 
and you're not done now take any other
block<00:01:05.740> any<00:01:05.950> block<00:01:06.340> you<00:01:06.520> want<00:01:06.700> one<00:01:07.600> two<00:01:08.189> one<00:01:09.189> two

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:09.250 
block any block you want one two one two

00:01:09.250 --> 00:01:11.219 
block any block you want one two one two
I'm<00:01:09.970> just<00:01:10.240> going<00:01:10.360> to<00:01:10.390> use<00:01:10.570> green<00:01:10.840> wool<00:01:11.049> like

00:01:11.219 --> 00:01:11.229 
I'm just going to use green wool like

00:01:11.229 --> 00:01:14.789 
I'm just going to use green wool like
this<00:01:11.439> and<00:01:12.180> one<00:01:13.180> to<00:01:13.509> two<00:01:13.900> so<00:01:14.320> it<00:01:14.470> looks<00:01:14.740> like

00:01:14.789 --> 00:01:14.799 
this and one to two so it looks like

00:01:14.799 --> 00:01:24.810 
this and one to two so it looks like
that<00:01:15.130> now<00:01:17.159> put<00:01:18.450> one<00:01:19.450> to<00:01:20.610> one<00:01:21.610> to<00:01:22.680> break<00:01:23.680> this<00:01:23.979> so

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:24.820 
that now put one to one to break this so

00:01:24.820 --> 00:01:28.889 
that now put one to one to break this so
you<00:01:24.880> have<00:01:25.180> a<00:01:25.240> two<00:01:25.600> block<00:01:25.840> height<00:01:27.689> now<00:01:28.689> the<00:01:28.750> next

00:01:28.889 --> 00:01:28.899 
you have a two block height now the next

00:01:28.899 --> 00:01:31.770 
you have a two block height now the next
thing<00:01:29.290> you<00:01:29.619> will<00:01:29.799> need<00:01:30.100> is<00:01:30.369> red<00:01:30.939> stone<00:01:31.240> so

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:31.780 
thing you will need is red stone so

00:01:31.780 --> 00:01:39.200 
thing you will need is red stone so
place<00:01:31.990> redstone<00:01:32.290> up<00:01:32.680> here<00:01:34.079> here<00:01:36.119> oops<00:01:37.439> and

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:39.210 
place redstone up here here oops and

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:43.649 
place redstone up here here oops and
right<00:01:40.210> over<00:01:40.240> here<00:01:40.930> after<00:01:41.770> that<00:01:42.670> get<00:01:43.180> any<00:01:43.329> block

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:43.659 
right over here after that get any block

00:01:43.659 --> 00:01:49.560 
right over here after that get any block
you<00:01:43.810> want<00:01:43.990> go<00:01:44.920> up<00:01:45.159> one<00:01:45.570> and<00:01:48.180> basically<00:01:49.180> that<00:01:49.539> is

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:49.570 
you want go up one and basically that is

00:01:49.570 --> 00:01:52.050 
you want go up one and basically that is
going<00:01:49.960> to<00:01:50.020> be<00:01:50.140> the<00:01:50.289> base<00:01:50.729> that's<00:01:51.729> going<00:01:51.909> to<00:01:52.000> be

00:01:52.050 --> 00:01:52.060 
going to be the base that's going to be

00:01:52.060 --> 00:01:57.660 
going to be the base that's going to be
the<00:01:52.240> floor<00:01:53.610> there

00:01:57.660 --> 00:01:57.670 

00:01:57.670 --> 00:02:00.090 

after<00:01:58.450> you've<00:01:58.630> done<00:01:58.840> that<00:01:58.900> grab<00:01:59.530> a<00:01:59.560> sticky

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:00.100 
after you've done that grab a sticky

00:02:00.100 --> 00:02:02.280 
after you've done that grab a sticky
piston<00:02:00.310> place<00:02:00.790> it<00:02:01.030> on<00:02:01.180> the<00:02:01.240> side<00:02:01.689> here<00:02:01.720> facing

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:02.290 
piston place it on the side here facing

00:02:02.290 --> 00:02:04.320 
piston place it on the side here facing
downwards<00:02:03.009> then<00:02:03.520> you<00:02:03.640> can<00:02:03.820> place<00:02:04.000> a<00:02:04.030> block

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:04.330 
downwards then you can place a block

00:02:04.330 --> 00:02:09.600 
downwards then you can place a block
down<00:02:04.770> don't<00:02:05.770> get<00:02:06.220> a<00:02:06.490> redstone<00:02:07.299> lamp<00:02:08.580> get<00:02:09.580> a

00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:09.610 
down don't get a redstone lamp get a

00:02:09.610 --> 00:02:12.979 
down don't get a redstone lamp get a
block<00:02:09.910> above<00:02:10.239> it<00:02:10.530> pull<00:02:11.530> out<00:02:11.680> a<00:02:11.709> lever<00:02:12.040> and

00:02:12.979 --> 00:02:12.989 
block above it pull out a lever and

00:02:12.989 --> 00:02:17.790 
block above it pull out a lever and
place<00:02:13.989> it<00:02:14.170> right<00:02:14.319> here<00:02:16.440> next<00:02:17.440> thing<00:02:17.560> you<00:02:17.680> want

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:17.800 
place it right here next thing you want

00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:22.860 
place it right here next thing you want
to<00:02:17.920> do<00:02:18.069> is<00:02:18.340> place<00:02:19.120> one<00:02:19.600> two<00:02:19.989> three<00:02:21.600> break<00:02:22.600> it

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:22.870 
to do is place one two three break it

00:02:22.870 --> 00:02:27.479 
to do is place one two three break it
here<00:02:23.560> so<00:02:24.310> you<00:02:24.370> have<00:02:24.580> a<00:02:24.810> two-gap<00:02:25.810> and<00:02:26.489> then

00:02:27.479 --> 00:02:27.489 
here so you have a two-gap and then

00:02:27.489 --> 00:02:30.990 
here so you have a two-gap and then
place<00:02:27.760> a<00:02:27.790> redstone<00:02:28.090> here<00:02:29.069> next<00:02:30.069> step<00:02:30.250> is<00:02:30.610> to<00:02:30.819> go

00:02:30.990 --> 00:02:31.000 
place a redstone here next step is to go

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:38.610 
place a redstone here next step is to go
this<00:02:31.780> way<00:02:33.209> one<00:02:34.209> up<00:02:34.390> break<00:02:35.110> it<00:02:35.140> and<00:02:37.290> fill<00:02:38.290> up<00:02:38.470> the

00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:38.620 
this way one up break it and fill up the

00:02:38.620 --> 00:02:42.000 
this way one up break it and fill up the
redstone<00:02:39.160> here<00:02:39.930> and<00:02:40.930> grab<00:02:41.170> the<00:02:41.319> block<00:02:41.530> place

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:42.010 
redstone here and grab the block place

00:02:42.010 --> 00:02:45.539 
redstone here and grab the block place
on<00:02:42.250> here<00:02:42.580> break<00:02:43.000> this<00:02:43.260> fill<00:02:44.260> this<00:02:44.440> up<00:02:44.680> grab

00:02:45.539 --> 00:02:45.549 
on here break this fill this up grab

00:02:45.549 --> 00:02:47.850 
on here break this fill this up grab
some<00:02:45.760> redstone<00:02:46.170> you<00:02:47.170> need<00:02:47.350> a<00:02:47.380> redstone

00:02:47.850 --> 00:02:47.860 
some redstone you need a redstone

00:02:47.860 --> 00:02:51.809 
some redstone you need a redstone
repeater<00:02:48.569> place<00:02:49.569> it<00:02:49.840> facing<00:02:50.739> this<00:02:51.250> way<00:02:51.310> and

00:02:51.809 --> 00:02:51.819 
repeater place it facing this way and

00:02:51.819 --> 00:02:55.620 
repeater place it facing this way and
put<00:02:52.720> it<00:02:52.840> to<00:02:53.019> I<00:02:53.290> believe<00:02:54.160> it's<00:02:54.370> two<00:02:55.030> ticks<00:02:55.330> or

00:02:55.620 --> 00:02:55.630 
put it to I believe it's two ticks or

00:02:55.630 --> 00:02:58.710 
put it to I believe it's two ticks or
one<00:02:56.019> tick<00:02:56.290> and<00:02:56.910> just<00:02:57.910> the<00:02:58.030> correction<00:02:58.450> for<00:02:58.630> the

00:02:58.710 --> 00:02:58.720 
one tick and just the correction for the

00:02:58.720 --> 00:03:00.840 
one tick and just the correction for the
