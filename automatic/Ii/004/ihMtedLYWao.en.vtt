isn't<00:03:34.209> very<00:03:34.389> good<00:03:34.599> this<00:03:35.590> guy's<00:03:35.829> has

00:03:36.300 --> 00:03:36.310 
isn't very good this guy's has

00:03:36.310 --> 00:03:37.409 
isn't very good this guy's has
definitely<00:03:36.699> got<00:03:36.819> a<00:03:36.849> lot<00:03:37.030> of<00:03:37.060> smooth

00:03:37.409 --> 00:03:37.419

00:03:38.849 --> 00:03:38.859 
articulation to be such a great figure

00:03:38.859 --> 00:03:40.830 
articulation to be such a great figure
so<00:03:39.669> it's<00:03:39.790> going<00:03:39.879> to<00:03:39.940> be<00:03:40.060> a<00:03:40.090> tough<00:03:40.419> choose

00:03:40.830 --> 00:03:40.840
