how to boil them but I had some eggs

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:13.430 
how to boil them but I had some eggs
that<00:00:11.790> kind<00:00:12.000> of<00:00:12.059> stuck<00:00:12.509> to<00:00:12.719> the<00:00:12.840> shell<00:00:13.110> and<00:00:13.320> they

00:00:13.430 --> 00:00:13.440 
that kind of stuck to the shell and they

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:15.860 
that kind of stuck to the shell and they
were<00:00:13.559> messy<00:00:14.040> and<00:00:14.219> hard<00:00:14.309> to<00:00:14.490> peel<00:00:14.820> has<00:00:15.750> that

00:00:15.860 --> 00:00:15.870 
were messy and hard to peel has that

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:18.140

ever<00:00:16.020> happened<00:00:16.109> to<00:00:16.590> you<00:00:16.800> where<00:00:17.550> the<00:00:17.820> shells

00:00:18.140 --> 00:00:18.150 
ever happened to you where the shells

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:20.540

kind<00:00:18.840> of<00:00:18.900> stick<00:00:19.289> to<00:00:19.470> the<00:00:19.590> egg<00:00:19.740> whites<00:00:19.770> and<00:00:20.340> then

00:00:20.540 --> 00:00:20.550 
kind of stick to the egg whites and then

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:23.150 
kind of stick to the egg whites and then
it<00:00:20.699> may<00:00:20.820> end<00:00:20.970> up<00:00:21.090> looking<00:00:21.300> like<00:00:21.510> craters<00:00:22.160> well

00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:23.160 
it may end up looking like craters well

it may end up looking like craters well
since<00:00:23.460> then<00:00:23.760> I<00:00:23.970> found<00:00:24.240> a<00:00:24.390> much<00:00:24.840> easier<00:00:25.170> way<00:00:25.740> to

00:00:25.759 --> 00:00:25.769 
since then I found a much easier way to

00:00:25.769 --> 00:00:27.950 
since then I found a much easier way to
peel<00:00:26.279> an<00:00:26.400> egg<00:00:26.519> so<00:00:26.939> I<00:00:26.970> decided<00:00:27.510> to<00:00:27.660> share<00:00:27.900> my

00:00:27.950 --> 00:00:27.960 
peel an egg so I decided to share my

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:30.259 
peel an egg so I decided to share my
technique<00:00:28.439> with<00:00:28.619> you<00:00:28.800> first<00:00:29.699> I'll<00:00:30.000> take<00:00:30.210> a

00:00:30.259 --> 00:00:30.269 
technique with you first I'll take a

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:32.990 
technique with you first I'll take a
large<00:00:30.660> pot<00:00:31.080> and<00:00:31.410> fill<00:00:32.009> it<00:00:32.160> with<00:00:32.189> water<00:00:32.550> about

00:00:32.990 --> 00:00:33.000 
large pot and fill it with water about

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:35.299 
large pot and fill it with water about
an<00:00:33.120> inch<00:00:33.329> high<00:00:33.420> now<00:00:34.350> with<00:00:34.680> a<00:00:34.710> steam<00:00:35.070> basket

00:00:35.299 --> 00:00:35.309

an inch high now with a steam basket
I'll<00:00:35.820> just<00:00:36.090> place<00:00:36.329> the<00:00:36.510> eggs<00:00:36.660> inside<00:00:37.110> cover

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:38.010 
I'll just place the eggs inside cover

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:40.040 
I'll just place the eggs inside cover
the<00:00:38.250> pot<00:00:38.460> and<00:00:38.700> let<00:00:38.790> it<00:00:39.149> come<00:00:39.360> to<00:00:39.390> a<00:00:39.510> low<00:00:39.750> boil

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:40.050 
the pot and let it come to a low boil

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:42.830 
the pot and let it come to a low boil
for<00:00:40.410> 20<00:00:40.920> minutes<00:00:41.250> on<00:00:41.370> medium<00:00:41.579> heat<00:00:42.059> if<00:00:42.420> you

00:00:42.830 --> 00:00:42.840 
for 20 minutes on medium heat if you

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:44.869 
for 20 minutes on medium heat if you
don't<00:00:43.230> have<00:00:43.469> a<00:00:43.500> steam<00:00:43.860> basket<00:00:44.070> you<00:00:44.579> can<00:00:44.610> use<00:00:44.850> a

00:00:44.869 --> 00:00:44.879 
don't have a steam basket you can use a

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:47.180 
don't have a steam basket you can use a
metal<00:00:45.239> strainer<00:00:45.750> that<00:00:46.050> fits<00:00:46.559> inside<00:00:46.770> the<00:00:47.010> pot

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:47.190 
metal strainer that fits inside the pot

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:49.190 
metal strainer that fits inside the pot
I'll<00:00:47.670> be<00:00:47.879> careful<00:00:48.329> making<00:00:48.539> sure<00:00:48.809> that<00:00:48.960> heat

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:49.200 
I'll be careful making sure that heat

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:50.900 
I'll be careful making sure that heat
isn't<00:00:49.379> too<00:00:49.680> high<00:00:49.890> because<00:00:50.280> I<00:00:50.399> don't<00:00:50.579> want<00:00:50.730> all

00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:50.910 
isn't too high because I don't want all

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:52.910 
isn't too high because I don't want all
