00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:25.189
 several methods to rotate your device 

00:00:23.090 --> 00:00:26.739
 android and I'm going to show you one of 

00:00:25.189 --> 00:00:28.910
 the best and you will not need 

00:00:26.739 --> 00:00:31.399
 computers or an additional program 

00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:32.660
 it's just your cell phone and download a 

00:00:31.399 --> 00:00:34.879
 program that I'm going to leave here below 

00:00:32.660 --> 00:00:37.339
 a description can prove it does not 

00:00:34.879 --> 00:00:40.129
 is going to affect your device i just 

00:00:37.339 --> 00:00:42.140
 to root my galaxy note 3 in the 

00:00:40.129 --> 00:00:44.120
 version 4 point 4.2 which is a version 

00:00:42.140 --> 00:00:46.339
 very recent and is a finished in the 

00:00:44.120 --> 00:00:48.620
 recent then with most of 

00:00:46.339 --> 00:00:50.780
 those on the phones works then 

00:00:48.620 --> 00:00:53.059
 it's simply that the application is 

00:00:50.780 --> 00:00:55.160
 call all the root that is this one that is 

00:00:53.059 --> 00:01:00.949
 here I will try it with the device 

00:00:55.160 --> 00:01:04.330
 the s3 which is a version and 747 and has 4 

00:01:00.949 --> 00:01:06.910
 points 2 or 4.3 I do not remember 

00:01:04.330 --> 00:01:09.220
 and it's just passarella pk we're going 

00:01:06.910 --> 00:01:11.940
 to install we are going to give it to you and 

00:01:09.220 --> 00:01:14.600
 we're just going to open it 

00:01:11.940 --> 00:01:17.509
 I'm going to check 

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:20.900
 here I will check the fence of the 

00:01:17.509 --> 00:01:24.979
 device the version is 4.1.2 of a 

00:01:20.900 --> 00:01:28.009
 zeta is international good 4g lte and 

00:01:24.979 --> 00:01:31.729
 Well, it would simply be enough to start 

00:01:28.009 --> 00:01:33.619
 the device and then practically in 

00:01:31.729 --> 00:01:35.560
 the application we are going to give you here in 

00:01:33.619 --> 00:01:37.869
 make it around 

00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:40.210
 rain I do not know what it is, we're just going 

00:01:37.869 --> 00:01:43.149
 to click and automatically the 

00:01:40.210 --> 00:01:45.070
 device is going to restart it was just going to 

00:01:43.149 --> 00:01:47.140
 restart already obviously with root access 

00:01:45.070 --> 00:01:49.329
 It's that easy in a few seconds 

00:01:47.140 --> 00:01:51.430
 that it took us to simply press a 

00:01:49.329 --> 00:01:53.679
 Install button and press a button is 

00:01:51.430 --> 00:01:55.960
 very simple we already have root access if your 

00:01:53.679 --> 00:01:57.310
 device is not rooted tells you that 

00:01:55.960 --> 00:01:59.200
 it is not compatible the only thing that has to 

00:01:57.310 --> 00:02:01.000
 do is look for a more current version 

00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:02.380
 of this application I'm going to leave it 

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:04.539
 as current as I can in the 

00:02:02.380 --> 00:02:06.100
 free description I 'm going to leave you the 

00:02:04.539 --> 00:02:08.259
 apk so you can download it 

00:02:06.100 --> 00:02:10.239
 and root any android device 

00:02:08.259 --> 00:02:12.970
 once done this we simply have 

00:02:10.239 --> 00:02:15.069
 to use our device and install 

00:02:12.970 --> 00:02:16.950
 what is the superuser from the 

00:02:15.069 --> 00:02:19.030
 Pleistocene 

00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:21.400
 very good guys we are going to install this 

00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:24.130
 application that is called super su super s 

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:26.410
 a superuser and we will install it now 

00:02:24.130 --> 00:02:30.099
 after this it is quite simple 

00:02:26.410 --> 00:02:32.170
 install and it would be all right guys for 

00:02:30.099 --> 00:02:35.080
 show them that you already have root access 

00:02:32.170 --> 00:02:37.959
 I'm just going to move on to Huawei that 

00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:40.660
 what it does is block advertising but 

00:02:37.959 --> 00:02:41.380
 because it occupies root access, which is what 

00:02:40.660 --> 00:02:43.300
 I'm going to show 

00:02:41.380 --> 00:02:45.370
 to see if you have root access 

00:02:43.300 --> 00:02:47.890
 I already did it with this method of 

00:02:45.370 --> 00:02:49.990
 minute 3 was the only method that to me 

00:02:47.890 --> 00:02:52.530
 it works very well here we are going to install 

00:02:49.990 --> 00:02:52.530
 the way side 

00:02:52.670 --> 00:02:55.810
 we are going to give it in open 

00:02:57.560 --> 00:03:01.130
 and here he is asking us for permits 

00:02:59.180 --> 00:03:06.020
 superuser we will give in allow 

00:03:01.130 --> 00:03:07.430
 and ready you have root access and can 

00:03:06.020 --> 00:03:09.319
 enter the super user to see all 

00:03:07.430 --> 00:03:11.270
 people who have root access 

00:03:09.319 --> 00:03:12.980
 they can also do it in minute 3 

00:03:11.270 --> 00:03:16.280
 so you can see that too 

00:03:12.980 --> 00:03:17.560
 I have root access from minot 3 and it has good 

00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:20.269
