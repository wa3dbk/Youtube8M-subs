sure that your needle is over the yarn

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:47.770 
sure that your needle is over the yarn
before<00:01:45.710> you<00:01:45.860> slip<00:01:46.160> it<00:01:46.310> into<00:01:46.460> the<00:01:46.580> stitch<00:01:47.000> okay

before you slip it into the stitch okay

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:51.930 
before you slip it into the stitch okay
then<00:01:48.200> we'll<00:01:48.290> bring<00:01:48.530> the<00:01:48.740> yarn<00:01:48.890> up<00:01:49.250> and<00:01:49.790> purl

then we'll bring the yarn up and purl

00:01:51.940 --> 00:01:54.730 
then we'll bring the yarn up and purl
and<00:01:52.940> now<00:01:53.210> we're<00:01:53.420> going<00:01:53.600> to<00:01:53.810> take<00:01:54.050> the<00:01:54.260> yarn<00:01:54.410> and

00:01:54.730 --> 00:01:54.740 
and now we're going to take the yarn and

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:58.830 
and now we're going to take the yarn and
bring<00:01:55.520> it<00:01:55.670> back<00:01:56.030> and<00:01:56.860> slip<00:01:57.860> the<00:01:58.130> next<00:01:58.310> stitch

and then we'll bring the yarn back in

00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:05.050 
and then we'll bring the yarn back in
front<00:02:03.080> so<00:02:03.440> it's<00:02:03.650> just<00:02:03.980> the<00:02:04.160> opposite<00:02:04.700> of<00:02:04.850> what

00:02:05.050 --> 00:02:05.060 
front so it's just the opposite of what

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:09.520 
front so it's just the opposite of what
we<00:02:05.180> did<00:02:05.210> on<00:02:05.690> row<00:02:06.490> 1<00:02:07.490> so<00:02:08.179> we'll<00:02:08.690> repeat<00:02:09.110> that<00:02:09.170> to

00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:09.530 
we did on row 1 so we'll repeat that to

00:02:09.530 --> 00:02:11.430 
we did on row 1 so we'll repeat that to
the<00:02:09.679> end<00:02:09.860> of<00:02:10.010> the<00:02:10.130> world<00:02:10.399> we're<00:02:10.610> in<00:02:10.640> a<00:02:10.850> purl

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:11.440 
the end of the world we're in a purl

00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:16.360 
the end of the world we're in a purl
bring<00:02:12.440> the<00:02:12.560> yarn<00:02:12.710> and<00:02:13.010> back<00:02:13.780> slip<00:02:15.370> bring

bring the yarn and back slip bring
Beyond<00:02:16.670> in<00:02:16.880> front<00:02:17.210> so<00:02:17.390> essentially<00:02:17.840> what

00:02:17.950 --> 00:02:17.960 
Beyond in front so essentially what

00:02:17.960 --> 00:02:19.620 
Beyond in front so essentially what
we're<00:02:18.080> doing<00:02:18.110> is<00:02:18.470> we're<00:02:18.620> knitting<00:02:19.220> every
