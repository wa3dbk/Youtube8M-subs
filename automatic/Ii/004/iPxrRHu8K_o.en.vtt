00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.609

00:00:02.970 --> 00:00:09.570
 yellow color let's talk about that at all 

00:00:05.609 --> 00:00:13.679
 there is art among general 

00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:14.969
 concepts of warm and cold colors what is it 

00:00:13.679 --> 00:00:17.699
 This means that some 

00:00:14.969 --> 00:00:20.970
 certain light vibrations te 

00:00:17.699 --> 00:00:23.400
 which belong to the warm colors and 

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:25.949
 warm we call red orange and 

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:30.090
 yellow they are in the human body 

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:33.200
 cause a reaction that gives a feeling 

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:37.050
 warmth and cool colors accordingly 

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:38.340
 green purple and blue they are in 

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:40.290
 human body create 

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:43.170
 physiological reactions that create 

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:45.690
 feeling cold and this people noticed 

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:48.379
 a very long time and wrote about this even Leonardo 

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:51.059
 yes Vinci in his work you see and 

00:00:48.379 --> 00:00:53.789
 talked about what to do with 

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:55.829
 cool and warm shades but we are with 

00:00:53.789 --> 00:00:58.020
 let's talk about yellow now 

00:00:55.829 --> 00:00:58.710
 what color associations do we have when we 

00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:02.460
 present 

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:06.090
 yellow chickens sun flowers 

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:08.369
 yellow is something related to gentle 

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:11.220
 fluffy how can be a little bit 

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:14.340
 defenseless something childish can 

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:17.299
 be a little bit infantile if yes such 

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:20.759
 sensations will be if we are talking about pure 

00:01:17.299 --> 00:01:22.610
 transparent rich yellow color on 

00:01:20.759 --> 00:01:24.720
 imagine that this color is a little bit 

00:01:22.610 --> 00:01:27.150
 dirty and immediately appear completely 

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:30.270
 other associations but also some 

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:32.970
 painful that this is something dirty can 

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:36.150
 be smelling bad it too can be 

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:37.829
 Yellow and again here, too, can 

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:40.200
 repeat and that there is no good or bad 

00:01:37.829 --> 00:01:42.329
 color and yellow color me good 

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:45.600
 not bad depends on how clean 

00:01:42.329 --> 00:01:48.570
 this Yellow and how much he 

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:50.939
 present in our life yellow color 

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:54.439
 if we talk about honest yellow 

00:01:50.939 --> 00:01:58.079
 you, too, relatively speaking childish color 

00:01:54.439 --> 00:02:02.140
 many in many sources we read 

00:01:58.079 --> 00:02:07.380
 that the yellow color calms the nerves 

00:02:02.140 --> 00:02:09.459
 but so calm even famous 

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:12.310
 mental hospitals used to be called 

00:02:09.459 --> 00:02:14.740
 for example the yellow house yes where in the beginning 

00:02:12.310 --> 00:02:16.420
 last century psychiatric clinics 

00:02:14.740 --> 00:02:18.520
 deliberately painted 

00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:20.709
 yellow because they believed that 

00:02:18.520 --> 00:02:24.670
 yellow soothes 

00:02:20.709 --> 00:02:27.910
 yellow color deprives intense action 

00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:29.830
 that is, he is so strong sang that 

00:02:27.910 --> 00:02:32.100
 man his presence especially if 

00:02:29.830 --> 00:02:34.750
 Here are a lot of colors as if lost 

00:02:32.100 --> 00:02:37.900
 relax and lose opportunity 

00:02:34.750 --> 00:02:40.300
 act on yellow 

00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:42.940
 quite intense and 

00:02:40.300 --> 00:02:45.190
 in the sense that it greatly improves 

00:02:42.940 --> 00:02:47.800
 appetite and people therefore in kindergartens 

00:02:45.190 --> 00:02:48.580
 yellow system is very good because 

00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:51.010
 what kids 

00:02:48.580 --> 00:02:52.780
 but they will be first calm second 

00:02:51.010 --> 00:02:56.019
 they will eat well that we still 

00:02:52.780 --> 00:02:59.709
 it is necessary if we see what symbolizes 

00:02:56.019 --> 00:03:02.050
 yellow in different cultures then yellow 

00:02:59.709 --> 00:03:05.560
 color generally symbolizes the earth and 

00:03:02.050 --> 00:03:09.340
 it is very logical because it goes and 

00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:15.070
 earth all shades of yellow we can 

00:03:09.340 --> 00:03:17.290
 find in stones in clay in the sand and they 

00:03:15.070 --> 00:03:19.209
 will be very very diverse but 

00:03:17.290 --> 00:03:22.450
 no less will they go walked like 

00:03:19.209 --> 00:03:24.579
 name yellow color and of course in 

00:03:22.450 --> 00:03:27.160
 plants and flowers here we see 

00:03:24.579 --> 00:03:29.739
 very beautiful yellow color here too 

00:03:27.160 --> 00:03:32.620
 we can pay attention to the fact that both 

00:03:29.739 --> 00:03:34.900
 yellow color work in relationship with 

00:03:32.620 --> 00:03:37.239
 other colors from the action can also 

00:03:34.900 --> 00:03:39.670
 be very different reactions imagine 

00:03:37.239 --> 00:03:42.610
 police tape that protected the 

00:03:39.670 --> 00:03:45.730
 danger zone it will be yellow 

00:03:42.610 --> 00:03:49.060
 and what else is yellow with black asoko tano paradise 

00:03:45.730 --> 00:03:51.450
 painfully bites china poisonous plants and 

00:03:49.060 --> 00:03:52.989
 here we see the effect of color 

00:03:51.450 --> 00:03:54.870
 extends not only to 

00:03:52.989 --> 00:03:57.790
 human eye for eye 

00:03:54.870 --> 00:04:01.269
 insects and animals that is everyone knows 

00:03:57.790 --> 00:04:03.940
 that black and yellow is dangerous or out 

00:04:01.269 --> 00:04:06.069
 there is no need and some in nature 

00:04:03.940 --> 00:04:09.120
 some insects for example 

00:04:06.069 --> 00:04:12.700
 in this way they create a protective 

00:04:09.120 --> 00:04:13.499
 protective not form so that they do not 

00:04:12.700 --> 00:04:16.329
 fell out 

00:04:13.499 --> 00:04:21.250
 those who like to eat for example 

00:04:16.329 --> 00:04:22.690
 second so yellow it's good and here 

00:04:21.250 --> 00:04:25.419
 we said already for children 

00:04:22.690 --> 00:04:28.120
 he is good in the interior especially that 

00:04:25.419 --> 00:04:31.780
 concerns living room or kitchen because 

00:04:28.120 --> 00:04:34.539
 he relaxes he sets good 

00:04:31.780 --> 00:04:38.830
 good was calm conversations to eat 

00:04:34.539 --> 00:04:41.199
 food but what will it look like in clothes 

00:04:38.830 --> 00:04:43.690
 Babies dress in yellow color 

00:04:41.199 --> 00:04:47.110
 okay some schools for elementary 

00:04:43.690 --> 00:04:49.060
 the school chooses the color of the form exactly there 

00:04:47.110 --> 00:04:51.160
 everywhere it's yellow yellow sweet cherished 

00:04:49.060 --> 00:04:54.000
 gadgets why just this trail away 

00:04:51.160 --> 00:04:57.370
 he has a very intense vibration 

00:04:54.000 --> 00:05:00.729
 waves to them the human eye immediately catches 

00:04:57.370 --> 00:05:02.860
 this vibration and we see here in the us is 

00:05:00.729 --> 00:05:05.320
 like chickens behind their chickens 

00:05:02.860 --> 00:05:07.870
 they are bright yellow she see side 

00:05:05.320 --> 00:05:10.150
 sight where they find also and if we

 kids dress yellow bright beacons we them 

00:05:10.150 --> 00:05:15.009
 far away we can safely be engaged 

00:05:12.759 --> 00:05:17.020
 their own affairs but nonetheless all the time 

00:05:15.009 --> 00:05:19.720
 as if out of the corner of their eyes watch a 

00:05:17.020 --> 00:05:23.620
 what happens yes adults wear 

00:05:19.720 --> 00:05:26.320
 yellow color strange reaction like 

00:05:23.620 --> 00:05:30.639
 the man immediately noticed but on the other 

00:05:26.320 --> 00:05:33.520
 side of some kind of cause it is not clear what 

00:05:30.639 --> 00:05:35.800
 this is for such a person without on stage and this 

00:05:33.520 --> 00:05:39.070
 one of them is a cai way yes there on 

00:05:35.800 --> 00:05:41.409
 black background yellow bright dress can 

00:05:39.070 --> 00:05:43.630
 be even very beautiful like a star in 

00:05:41.409 --> 00:05:45.940
 dark sky but come to work 

00:05:43.630 --> 00:05:46.400
 for example people there quality right away 

00:05:45.940 --> 00:05:50.479
