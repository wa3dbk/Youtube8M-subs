for Jesus word of God's Spirit of God
Jesus<00:01:51.659> Christ<00:01:52.079> and<00:01:52.829> then<00:01:53.460> Quran<00:01:53.759> says<00:01:54.030> that

00:01:54.050 --> 00:01:54.060 
Jesus Christ and then Quran says that

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:56.600 
Jesus Christ and then Quran says that
Jesus<00:01:54.780> spoke<00:01:55.140> when<00:01:55.439> he<00:01:55.470> was<00:01:55.799> very<00:01:56.130> small

00:01:56.600 --> 00:01:56.610 
Jesus spoke when he was very small

00:01:56.610 --> 00:01:59.240 
Jesus spoke when he was very small
like<00:01:56.909> two<00:01:57.149> days<00:01:57.420> old<00:01:57.719> after<00:01:57.960> his<00:01:58.140> birth<00:01:58.380> he

00:01:59.240 --> 00:01:59.250 
like two days old after his birth he

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:02.179 
like two days old after his birth he
began<00:01:59.460> to<00:01:59.640> speak<00:02:00.110> Quran<00:02:01.110> says<00:02:01.380> that<00:02:01.560> Jesus

00:02:02.179 --> 00:02:02.189 
began to speak Quran says that Jesus

00:02:02.189 --> 00:02:04.969 
began to speak Quran says that Jesus
created<00:02:02.520> a<00:02:02.969> live<00:02:03.270> birth<00:02:03.659> with<00:02:04.290> mother

00:02:04.969 --> 00:02:04.979 
created a live birth with mother

00:02:04.979 --> 00:02:07.219 
created a live birth with mother
it<00:02:05.219> took<00:02:05.369> someone<00:02:05.790> from<00:02:06.060> their<00:02:06.689> birth<00:02:06.840> then<00:02:07.079> he

00:02:07.219 --> 00:02:07.229 
it took someone from their birth then he

00:02:07.229 --> 00:02:08.999 
it took someone from their birth then he
breathed<00:02:07.530> into<00:02:07.740> it<00:02:07.979> became<00:02:08.280> a<00:02:08.310> libel

00:02:08.999 --> 00:02:09.009 
breathed into it became a libel

00:02:09.009 --> 00:02:12.300 
breathed into it became a libel
so<00:02:10.000> I<00:02:10.030> think<00:02:10.179> that<00:02:10.539> he<00:02:10.780> can<00:02:11.020> give<00:02:11.230> life<00:02:11.440> did

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:12.310 
so I think that he can give life did

00:02:12.310 --> 00:02:14.610 
so I think that he can give life did
you'd<00:02:12.459> like<00:02:12.670> to<00:02:12.849> have<00:02:12.970> mother<00:02:13.209> claims<00:02:13.620> and

00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:14.620 
you'd like to have mother claims and

00:02:14.620 --> 00:02:16.530 
you'd like to have mother claims and
then<00:02:14.800> Quran<00:02:15.099> says<00:02:15.340> that<00:02:15.370> be<00:02:15.700> secured<00:02:16.239> a<00:02:16.330> man
