00:00:05.229 --> 00:00:11.660
 intercontinental is a prize of 

00:00:08.510 --> 00:00:14.330
 beauty and usually on the catwalk 

00:00:11.660 --> 00:00:17.170
 must be able to move with the 

00:00:14.330 --> 00:00:20.300
 music and with their own sensuality 

00:00:17.170 --> 00:00:23.600
 how easy it was or how long it was 

00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:26.390
 difficult with emotions and the problem 

00:00:23.600 --> 00:00:28.810
 of not being able to hear music like 

00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:28.810
 all the others 

00:00:35.110 --> 00:00:42.020
 all its solution 

00:00:38.140 --> 00:00:44.750
 actually very easy because i 

00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:47.300
 I feel with my heart with my neck 

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:51.320
 in my legs on my body the rhythm 

00:00:47.300 --> 00:00:54.469
 I feel it and so I could walk with it 

00:00:51.320 --> 00:00:56.180
 rhythm when rises have stopped 

00:00:54.469 --> 00:00:59.690
 I also stopped there I was 

00:00:56.180 --> 00:01:02.030
 however, looking at it did not make me 

00:00:59.690 --> 00:01:04.460
 no problem this walkway 

00:01:02.030 --> 00:01:09.200
 I am very happy because my world 

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:09.829
 it's much better for the people of yours 

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:14.959
 country 

00:01:09.829 --> 00:01:20.270
 if an icon a symbol for you a 

00:01:14.959 --> 00:01:24.889
 respect and an estimate that goes far beyond 

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:27.649
 beyond your beauty as it happened 

00:01:24.889 --> 00:01:30.159
 this how you used the visibility of 

00:01:27.649 --> 00:01:30.159
 this award 

00:01:37.119 --> 00:01:43.909
 given my story is that I have 

00:01:42.229 --> 00:01:45.530
 participated in this competition by 

00:01:43.909 --> 00:01:47.299
 beauty that helped me to become 

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:52.189
 much more secure in myself however from 

00:01:47.299 --> 00:01:54.470
 when i attended people did 

00:01:52.189 --> 00:01:56.840
 I started looking at myself 

00:01:54.470 --> 00:01:59.360
 be careful because you site itself 

00:01:56.840 --> 00:02:02.539
 they take that they are that they are beautiful but not 

00:01:59.360 --> 00:02:09.200
 I do not hear and they could not were not 

00:02:02.539 --> 00:02:16.900
 surprised by this fact then after being 

00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:19.190
 back I lived as being deaf 

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:22.430
 answer explored what it can 

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:24.650
 be nice and good for people and me 

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:27.380
 I would like to pass on these experiences 

00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:30.950
 I would like to explain to people what is there 

00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:32.780
 need what really helps us why 

00:02:30.950 --> 00:02:34.160
 it's very nice that people do too 

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:40.760
 he wanted to help them understand it 

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:42.650
 what I really help 

00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:43.370
 this language is very important 

00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:46.700
 of signs 

00:02:43.370 --> 00:02:49.760
 it would be very nice if the children i 

00:02:46.700 --> 00:02:52.220
 kids already could start 

00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:55.340
 learn this sign language 

00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:56.060
 because they could develop such a 

00:02:55.340 --> 00:02:58.790
 other sense 

00:02:56.060 --> 00:03:01.810
 so too is parental communication 

00:02:58.790 --> 00:03:03.950
 and children could be insured 

00:03:01.810 --> 00:03:07.090
 could increase 

00:03:03.950 --> 00:03:10.730
 also their horizon of knowledge 

00:03:07.090 --> 00:03:12.610
 when I was little I had so many 

00:03:10.730 --> 00:03:18.500
 problems with this because I didn't have 

00:03:12.610 --> 00:03:22.750
 sufficient information in some 

00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:22.750
 countries being women is a handicap 

00:03:24.530 --> 00:03:29.920
 we have just finished the two 

00:03:26.239 --> 00:03:29.920
 weeks of the women's weeks 

00:03:32.299 --> 00:03:37.569
 what message what words you mean 

00:03:34.370 --> 00:03:37.569
 to the women of the world 

00:03:46.590 --> 00:03:53.799
 I don't know it won't be so long important 

00:03:51.280 --> 00:03:57.879
 never to stop and you must 

00:03:53.799 --> 00:04:02.310
 do not say your dreams come true 

00:03:57.879 --> 00:04:05.079
 you can't make your dreams come true 

00:04:02.310 --> 00:04:07.650
 and the last question is which ones are yours 

00:04:05.079 --> 00:04:07.650
 future projects 

00:04:16.350 --> 00:04:22.479
 well my future plans 

00:04:19.720 --> 00:04:23.949
 it's a very good question I really would like 

00:04:22.479 --> 00:04:27.120
 do something very interesting 

00:04:23.949 --> 00:04:33.160
 I would like to open a bar and a restaurant 

00:04:27.120 --> 00:04:35.740
 where are deaf people will work with 

00:04:33.160 --> 00:04:38.650
 this I would like to achieve and I would like to give 

00:04:35.740 --> 00:04:41.560
 the message of two things on the one hand that 

00:04:38.650 --> 00:04:42.220
 we are not different from others by 

00:04:41.560 --> 00:04:44.139
 others 

00:04:42.220 --> 00:04:51.970
 on the other hand I would like to help i 

00:04:44.139 --> 00:04:55.020
 my companions arose giving work and 

00:04:51.970 --> 00:04:59.190
 it would also be a road to 

00:04:55.020 --> 00:04:59.190
 advertise sign language
