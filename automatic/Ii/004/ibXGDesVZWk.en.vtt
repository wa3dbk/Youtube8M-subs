making it so you can you can put your

00:01:21.460 --> 00:01:24.090 
making it so you can you can put your
SSD<00:01:22.000> in<00:01:22.120> here<00:01:22.420> you<00:01:22.900> can<00:01:23.110> wrap<00:01:23.530> it<00:01:23.560> up<00:01:23.800> in<00:01:23.950> here

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:24.100 
SSD in here you can wrap it up in here

00:01:39.070 --> 00:01:41.490 
and there's gonna be no damage to your
safe<00:01:39.370> SSD<00:01:39.940> with<00:01:40.120> an<00:01:40.240> inch<00:01:40.510> of<00:01:40.720> foam<00:01:40.960> on<00:01:41.200> every

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:41.500 
safe SSD with an inch of foam on every

00:01:41.500 --> 00:01:43.350 
safe SSD with an inch of foam on every
side<00:01:42.240> whatsoever

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:43.360

00:01:43.360 --> 00:01:46.530

alright<00:01:43.780> so<00:01:44.470> let's<00:01:44.740> pull<00:01:44.980> out<00:01:45.250> the<00:01:45.700> SSD<00:01:46.180> itself

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:46.540 
alright so let's pull out the SSD itself

00:01:46.540 --> 00:01:48.000 
alright so let's pull out the SSD itself
and<00:01:46.750> let's<00:01:46.870> talk<00:01:47.020> specs<00:01:47.410> for<00:01:47.590> a<00:01:47.650> little<00:01:47.890> bit

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:48.010 
and let's talk specs for a little bit

00:01:48.010 --> 00:01:52.080 
and let's talk specs for a little bit
here<00:01:48.220> so<00:01:49.180> this<00:01:49.330> is<00:01:49.510> a<00:01:49.540> SandForce<00:01:50.610> 2281<00:01:51.610> drive

00:01:52.080 --> 00:01:52.090 
here so this is a SandForce 2281 drive

00:01:52.090 --> 00:01:54.540 
here so this is a SandForce 2281 drive
which<00:01:52.690> is<00:01:52.720> pretty<00:01:53.440> much<00:01:53.590> the<00:01:53.890> same<00:01:54.070> controller

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:54.550 
which is pretty much the same controller

00:01:54.550 --> 00:01:57.390 
which is pretty much the same controller
that<00:01:54.790> is<00:01:54.880> being<00:01:55.090> used<00:01:55.420> in<00:01:55.690> any<00:01:56.170> SandForce<00:01:56.860> SATA

00:01:57.390 --> 00:01:57.400 
that is being used in any SandForce SATA

00:01:57.400 --> 00:01:59.970 
that is being used in any SandForce SATA
3<00:01:57.490> SSD<00:01:58.150> at<00:01:58.300> this<00:01:58.510> time<00:01:58.750> but<00:01:59.410> there<00:01:59.770> is<00:01:59.950> a

00:01:59.970 --> 00:01:59.980 
3 SSD at this time but there is a

00:01:59.980 --> 00:02:01.860 
3 SSD at this time but there is a
difference<00:02:00.580> in<00:02:00.700> terms<00:02:00.970> of<00:02:01.180> the<00:02:01.330> quality<00:02:01.780> of

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:01.870 
difference in terms of the quality of

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:03.970 
the NAND chips that are used from one

00:02:03.970 --> 00:02:05.790 
the NAND chips that are used from one

00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:52.890 
your standard mounting holes so a lot of

00:02:52.890 --> 00:02:54.920 
your standard mounting holes so a lot of
people<00:02:53.160> have<00:02:53.280> asked<00:02:53.580> me<00:02:53.700> to<00:02:53.730> do<00:02:54.090> round<00:02:54.450> ups<00:02:54.720> of

00:02:57.170 --> 00:02:57.180 
SATA 3 drives and I will tell you guys

00:02:57.180 --> 00:02:58.880 
SATA 3 drives and I will tell you guys
it's<00:02:57.420> kind<00:02:57.600> of<00:02:57.720> unnecessary<00:02:57.990> because<00:02:58.470> I<00:02:58.650> can

00:02:58.880 --> 00:02:58.890 
it's kind of unnecessary because I can

00:02:58.890 --> 00:03:00.590 
it's kind of unnecessary because I can
pretty<00:02:59.130> much<00:02:59.190> tell<00:02:59.490> you<00:02:59.640> what<00:02:59.820> everything<00:03:00.240> is

00:03:00.590 --> 00:03:00.600 
pretty much tell you what everything is

00:03:00.600 --> 00:03:02.570 
pretty much tell you what everything is
so<00:03:00.930> the<00:03:01.230> Chronos<00:03:01.560> deluxe<00:03:01.980> I'll<00:03:02.160> tell<00:03:02.340> you<00:03:02.430> guys

00:03:02.570 --> 00:03:02.580 
so the Chronos deluxe I'll tell you guys

00:03:02.580 --> 00:03:05.120 
so the Chronos deluxe I'll tell you guys
what<00:03:02.880> it<00:03:03.000> is<00:03:03.120> equivalent<00:03:03.480> to<00:03:03.870> its<00:03:04.470> equivalent

00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:05.130 
what it is equivalent to its equivalent

00:03:05.130 --> 00:03:07.520 
what it is equivalent to its equivalent
to<00:03:05.370> the<00:03:05.580> max<00:03:05.880> I<00:03:06.060> ops<00:03:06.300> from<00:03:06.540> OCZ<00:03:07.050> and<00:03:07.350> it<00:03:07.410> is

00:03:07.520 --> 00:03:07.530 
to the max I ops from OCZ and it is

00:03:07.530 --> 00:03:09.410 
to the max I ops from OCZ and it is
equivalent<00:03:07.830> to<00:03:08.190> the<00:03:08.280> wildfire<00:03:08.760> from<00:03:08.940> patriot

00:03:09.410 --> 00:03:09.420 
equivalent to the wildfire from patriot

00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:11.390 
equivalent to the wildfire from patriot
in<00:03:09.510> terms<00:03:09.720> of<00:03:09.840> performance<00:03:10.350> yes<00:03:11.010> it<00:03:11.220> will

00:03:11.390 --> 00:03:11.400 
in terms of performance yes it will

00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:13.700 
in terms of performance yes it will
perform<00:03:11.790> identically<00:03:12.630> to<00:03:13.110> either<00:03:13.260> those

00:03:13.700 --> 00:03:13.710 
perform identically to either those

00:03:13.710 --> 00:03:16.280 
perform identically to either those
drives<00:03:14.070> so<00:03:14.670> if<00:03:15.060> you<00:03:15.210> see<00:03:15.420> a<00:03:15.450> Chronos<00:03:15.930> that's<00:03:16.200> a

00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:16.290 
drives so if you see a Chronos that's a

00:03:16.290 --> 00:03:18.470 
drives so if you see a Chronos that's a
good<00:03:16.470> deal<00:03:16.680> then<00:03:17.250> go<00:03:17.580> ahead<00:03:17.700> and<00:03:17.850> snap<00:03:18.240> it<00:03:18.390> up

00:03:18.470 --> 00:03:18.480 
good deal then go ahead and snap it up

00:03:18.480 --> 00:03:19.850 
good deal then go ahead and snap it up
you'll<00:03:18.660> know<00:03:18.780> what<00:03:18.960> to<00:03:19.080> compare<00:03:19.260> it<00:03:19.560> to<00:03:19.710> in
