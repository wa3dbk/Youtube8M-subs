mythical beasts and creatures that are

00:01:00.679 --> 00:01:07.440 
mythical beasts and creatures that are
in<00:01:00.769> those<00:01:00.889> films<00:01:01.129> are<00:01:01.579> just<00:01:01.960> awesome

00:01:07.440 --> 00:01:07.450 

00:01:07.450 --> 00:01:10.140 

there's<00:01:08.110> just<00:01:08.290> this<00:01:08.759> kind<00:01:09.759> of<00:01:09.850> weird

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:10.150 
there's just this kind of weird

00:01:10.150 --> 00:01:12.090 
there's just this kind of weird
otherworldly<00:01:10.900> quality<00:01:11.229> to<00:01:11.619> them<00:01:11.770> that<00:01:12.040> I

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:12.100 
otherworldly quality to them that I

00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:15.840 
otherworldly quality to them that I
think<00:01:12.280> is<00:01:13.229> kind<00:01:14.229> of<00:01:14.259> missing<00:01:14.470> from<00:01:14.950> modern<00:01:15.280> cge

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:15.850 
think is kind of missing from modern cge

00:01:15.850 --> 00:01:18.120 
think is kind of missing from modern cge
and<00:01:16.780> then<00:01:16.899> video<00:01:17.080> games<00:01:17.380> basically<00:01:17.710> feels

00:01:18.120 --> 00:01:18.130 
and then video games basically feels

00:01:18.130 --> 00:01:20.070 
and then video games basically feels
just<00:01:18.430> like<00:01:18.549> modern<00:01:18.880> CG<00:01:19.270> to<00:01:19.420> me<00:01:19.540> and<00:01:19.750> I<00:01:19.780> don't

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:20.080 
just like modern CG to me and I don't

00:01:20.080 --> 00:01:21.870 
just like modern CG to me and I don't
think<00:01:20.200> there's<00:01:20.439> enough<00:01:20.649> like<00:01:20.860> a<00:01:21.100> bat

00:01:21.870 --> 00:01:21.880 
think there's enough like a bat

00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:24.990 
think there's enough like a bat
craftsmanship<00:01:22.840> that<00:01:23.080> goes<00:01:23.259> into<00:01:24.000> like

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:25.000 
craftsmanship that goes into like

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:27.840 
craftsmanship that goes into like
creating<00:01:25.450> that<00:01:25.570> stuff<00:01:26.549> it's<00:01:27.549> more<00:01:27.700> of<00:01:27.729> an

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:27.850 
creating that stuff it's more of an

00:01:27.850 --> 00:01:30.389 
creating that stuff it's more of an
homage<00:01:28.090> I<00:01:28.330> would<00:01:28.420> say<00:01:28.600> I<00:01:28.869> guess<00:01:29.080> like<00:01:29.440> pay

00:01:30.389 --> 00:01:30.399 
homage I would say I guess like pay

00:01:30.399 --> 00:01:32.639 
homage I would say I guess like pay
homage<00:01:30.610> to<00:01:30.670> to<00:01:31.270> Harryhausen<00:01:31.810> and<00:01:32.140> the<00:01:32.409> stuff

00:01:32.639 --> 00:01:32.649

00:01:59.580 --> 00:01:59.590 
this thing because it's like it's just

00:01:59.590 --> 00:02:02.010 
this thing because it's like it's just
too<00:01:59.890> big<00:02:00.100> and<00:02:00.369> like<00:02:00.520> epic<00:02:00.940> to<00:02:01.179> fight<00:02:01.780> on<00:02:01.899> your

00:02:02.010 --> 00:02:02.020 
too big and like epic to fight on your

00:02:02.020 --> 00:02:04.230 
too big and like epic to fight on your
own<00:02:02.140> so<00:02:02.470> it's<00:02:02.619> like<00:02:02.770> I<00:02:03.009> think<00:02:03.670> it<00:02:03.819> really<00:02:04.000> feeds

00:02:04.230 --> 00:02:04.240 
own so it's like I think it really feeds

00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:05.940 
own so it's like I think it really feeds
into<00:02:04.479> the<00:02:04.659> cooperative<00:02:05.229> nature<00:02:05.380> of<00:02:05.649> the<00:02:05.770> game

00:02:05.940 --> 00:02:05.950 
into the cooperative nature of the game

00:02:05.950 --> 00:02:07.889 
into the cooperative nature of the game
like<00:02:06.190> just<00:02:06.399> being<00:02:06.549> able<00:02:06.640> to<00:02:06.759> group<00:02:07.450> up<00:02:07.630> and

00:02:07.889 --> 00:02:07.899 
like just being able to group up and

00:02:07.899 --> 00:02:09.770 
like just being able to group up and
like<00:02:07.990> fight<00:02:08.200> these<00:02:08.350> big<00:02:08.530> creatures<00:02:08.860> together

00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:09.780 
like fight these big creatures together

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:12.120 
like fight these big creatures together
and<00:02:10.780> I<00:02:11.110> think<00:02:11.290> we<00:02:11.350> can<00:02:11.470> also<00:02:11.590> get<00:02:11.829> that<00:02:11.859> across

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:12.130 
and I think we can also get that across

00:02:12.130 --> 00:02:14.160 
and I think we can also get that across
like<00:02:12.459> in<00:02:12.640> between<00:02:12.730> these<00:02:13.480> missions<00:02:13.870> you'll<00:02:14.049> be

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:14.170 
like in between these missions you'll be

00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:16.110 
like in between these missions you'll be

00:02:39.569 --> 00:02:39.579 
build and hopefully it doesn't like

00:02:39.579 --> 00:02:42.569 
build and hopefully it doesn't like
crash<00:02:39.850> or<00:02:40.120> D<00:02:40.329> sinker

00:02:42.569 --> 00:02:42.579 
crash or D sinker

00:02:42.579 --> 00:02:44.009 
crash or D sinker
because<00:02:43.060> that's<00:02:43.239> what<00:02:43.450> we're<00:02:43.569> gonna<00:02:43.659> upload

00:02:44.009 --> 00:02:44.019 
because that's what we're gonna upload

00:02:44.019 --> 00:02:45.300 
because that's what we're gonna upload
this<00:02:44.140> team<00:02:44.439> that's<00:02:44.680> what<00:02:44.799> we're<00:02:44.950> gonna<00:02:45.069> like

00:02:45.300 --> 00:02:45.310 
this team that's what we're gonna like

00:02:45.310 --> 00:02:46.830 
this team that's what we're gonna like
distributing<00:02:45.849> stuff<00:02:46.090> we're<00:02:46.480> like<00:02:46.629> in<00:02:46.749> the

00:02:46.830 --> 00:02:46.840 
distributing stuff we're like in the

00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:48.449 
distributing stuff we're like in the
middle<00:02:47.079> of<00:02:47.139> it<00:02:47.290> right<00:02:47.469> now<00:02:47.499> and<00:02:47.769> that's<00:02:47.920> this

00:02:48.449 --> 00:02:48.459 
middle of it right now and that's this

00:02:48.459 --> 00:02:49.770 
middle of it right now and that's this
process<00:02:48.849> is<00:02:48.999> a<00:02:49.030> little<00:02:49.239> bit<00:02:49.389> weird<00:02:49.659> because

00:02:49.770 --> 00:02:49.780 
process is a little bit weird because

00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:52.289 
process is a little bit weird because
usually<00:02:49.989> we<00:02:50.260> don't<00:02:50.379> show<00:02:50.950> people<00:02:51.189> video<00:02:51.939> games

00:02:52.289 --> 00:02:52.299 
usually we don't show people video games

00:02:52.299 --> 00:02:54.539 
usually we don't show people video games
this<00:02:52.629> this<00:02:53.349> early<00:02:53.530> on<00:02:53.799> in<00:02:53.920> the<00:02:54.010> process<00:02:54.430> this

00:02:54.539 --> 00:02:54.549 
this this early on in the process this

00:02:54.549 --> 00:02:57.059 
this this early on in the process this
is<00:02:54.609> really<00:02:54.999> like<00:02:55.290> the<00:02:56.290> two-week<00:02:56.650> prototype

00:02:57.059 --> 00:02:57.069 
is really like the two-week prototype

00:02:57.069 --> 00:02:58.679 
is really like the two-week prototype
that<00:02:57.219> we<00:02:57.340> did<00:02:57.489> for<00:02:57.760> the<00:02:57.879> last<00:02:58.120> amnesia

00:02:58.679 --> 00:02:58.689 
that we did for the last amnesia

00:02:58.689 --> 00:03:01.530 
that we did for the last amnesia
fortnight<00:02:58.930> and<00:02:59.260> then<00:02:59.950> Tim<00:03:00.909> was<00:03:01.060> into<00:03:01.239> the<00:03:01.329> idea

00:03:01.530 --> 00:03:01.540 
fortnight and then Tim was into the idea

00:03:01.540 --> 00:03:02.819 
fortnight and then Tim was into the idea
a<00:03:01.599> lot<00:03:01.780> of<00:03:01.870> people<00:03:02.079> at<00:03:02.170> the<00:03:02.260> studio<00:03:02.530> or<00:03:02.680> into

00:03:02.819 --> 00:03:02.829 
a lot of people at the studio or into

00:03:02.829 --> 00:03:05.429 
a lot of people at the studio or into
the<00:03:02.920> idea<00:03:03.159> and<00:03:03.459> so<00:03:04.120> you<00:03:04.599> know<00:03:04.689> we<00:03:04.810> just<00:03:04.989> want<00:03:05.379> to

00:03:05.429 --> 00:03:05.439 
the idea and so you know we just want to

00:03:05.439 --> 00:03:07.289 
the idea and so you know we just want to
make<00:03:05.560> this<00:03:05.680> game<00:03:05.889> so<00:03:05.950> you<00:03:06.670> had<00:03:06.819> you<00:03:07.180> know<00:03:07.269> a

00:03:07.289 --> 00:03:07.299 
make this game so you had you know a

00:03:07.299 --> 00:03:08.849 
make this game so you had you know a
couple<00:03:07.540> extra<00:03:07.810> resources<00:03:08.200> laying<00:03:08.409> around<00:03:08.500> so

00:03:08.849 --> 00:03:08.859 
couple extra resources laying around so

00:03:08.859 --> 00:03:10.379 
couple extra resources laying around so
we<00:03:08.980> polished<00:03:09.609> it<00:03:09.639> up<00:03:09.790> a<00:03:09.849> little<00:03:09.939> bit<00:03:10.150> so<00:03:10.359> that

00:03:10.379 --> 00:03:10.389 
we polished it up a little bit so that

00:03:10.389 --> 00:03:12.420 
we polished it up a little bit so that
we<00:03:10.510> can<00:03:10.689> actually<00:03:10.829> get<00:03:11.829> it<00:03:11.889> out<00:03:12.069> there<00:03:12.280> and

00:03:12.420 --> 00:03:12.430 
we can actually get it out there and

00:03:12.430 --> 00:03:14.099 
we can actually get it out there and
show<00:03:12.730> it<00:03:12.790> to<00:03:12.879> people<00:03:12.999> and<00:03:13.359> and<00:03:13.750> see<00:03:13.989> what

teenagers now like they've probably only

00:04:26.199 --> 00:04:28.589

as this unique thing that they've like

00:04:33.610 --> 00:04:35.129 
as this unique thing that they've like
never<00:04:33.909> seen<00:04:34.180> before<00:04:34.330> and<00:04:34.630> they're<00:04:34.750> like<00:04:34.900> what

00:04:37.620 --> 00:04:37.630 
and then learning the origins of it like

00:04:37.630 --> 00:04:38.969 
and then learning the origins of it like
I<00:04:37.719> hope<00:04:37.870> that<00:04:38.050> they<00:04:38.139> go<00:04:38.259> back<00:04:38.409> and<00:04:38.620> watch<00:04:38.770> the
