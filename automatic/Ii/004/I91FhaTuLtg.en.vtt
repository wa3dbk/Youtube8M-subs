00:00:01.480 --> 00:00:06.670
 it's more than clear that the apple world 

00:00:04.029 --> 00:00:08.680
 is increasingly linked to the world of 

00:00:06.670 --> 00:00:11.379
 videogames and more that could be 

00:00:08.680 --> 00:00:13.270
 with the new ipad and the new iphones 

00:00:11.379 --> 00:00:15.549
 that apparently would have screens 

00:00:13.270 --> 00:00:18.070
 greatest imaginable consoles of 

00:00:15.549 --> 00:00:20.410
 fully portable video games with 

00:00:18.070 --> 00:00:23.050
 Screen sizes more than acceptable 

00:00:20.410 --> 00:00:25.330
 the new one has just been released in the USA 

00:00:23.050 --> 00:00:27.810
 iphone 5 that has not yet reached 

00:00:25.330 --> 00:00:30.460
 Spain but the speculations begin 

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:33.370
 about the future apple mobile phone 

00:00:30.460 --> 00:00:35.289
 and your next products like the ipad 

00:00:33.370 --> 00:00:38.170
 a lot of attention because according to reports 

00:00:35.289 --> 00:00:40.270
 display search among others the market 

00:00:38.170 --> 00:00:42.730
 of the American video game the future of 

00:00:40.270 --> 00:00:45.160
 the apple devices is to bet on 

00:00:42.730 --> 00:00:48.039
 a renovation of the screens something that 

00:00:45.160 --> 00:00:50.530
 already made iphone 4 in your day you know 

00:00:48.039 --> 00:00:54.039
 that the iphone 4 jumped from a resolution 

00:00:50.530 --> 00:00:57.070
 iphone 3gs standard of 72 points per 

00:00:54.039 --> 00:00:59.230
 inches to the retina screen of iphone 

00:00:57.070 --> 00:01:01.390
 4 that have been inherited by the 

00:00:59.230 --> 00:01:03.160
 following devices based on 

00:01:01.390 --> 00:01:04.930
 investigations in the chains of 

00:01:03.160 --> 00:01:06.910
 production next year 

00:01:04.930 --> 00:01:08.110
 apple would change the screens of all 

00:01:06.910 --> 00:01:11.110
 their products 

00:01:08.110 --> 00:01:12.820
 of this the main change the point of 

00:01:11.110 --> 00:01:14.830
 innovation of these new versions 

00:01:12.820 --> 00:01:17.230
 but not only are we going to find 

00:01:14.830 --> 00:01:19.750
 with new versions of the products already 

00:01:17.230 --> 00:01:22.720
 existing apple but dare 

00:01:19.750 --> 00:01:25.450
 to say that they will include new services 

00:01:22.720 --> 00:01:27.850
 new products like for example ai 

00:01:25.450 --> 00:01:30.130
 watch apple television a lot 

00:01:27.850 --> 00:01:32.500
 attention for example the iphone 6 would have 

00:01:30.130 --> 00:01:34.900
 two versions both with a screen of 

00:01:32.500 --> 00:01:37.450
 larger than the iphone 5 and 

00:01:34.900 --> 00:01:40.090
 iphone 5 s while that of the mobile 

00:01:37.450 --> 00:01:44.500
 current apple has 4 inches and one 

00:01:40.090 --> 00:01:48.160
 resolution of 1,136 x 640 the iphone 6 

00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:49.930
 would have two versions a version of 47 

00:01:48.160 --> 00:01:56.470
 inches of screen with a resolution 

00:01:49.930 --> 00:01:58.720
 of 1280 x 720 that is to say the 720p and a 

00:01:56.470 --> 00:02:02.619
 screen that would be a kind of tablet 

00:01:58.720 --> 00:02:06.369
 of 57 inches with full hd resolution of 

00:02:02.619 --> 00:02:08.470
 1920 x 1080 both would leave according to the 

00:02:06.369 --> 00:02:10.780
 information at the end of next year 

00:02:08.470 --> 00:02:13.150
 2014 but these are not the only 

00:02:10.780 --> 00:02:14.680
 new fixes in the case of the ipad 

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:16.959
 how will it evolve 

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:20.769
 this apple tablet the next version 

00:02:16.959 --> 00:02:25.269
 of ipad would have 9 7 inches and its 

00:02:20.769 --> 00:02:27.670
 definition would be 2048 x 1536 but the 

00:02:25.269 --> 00:02:29.709
 screen would have a much thinner edge 

00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:32.349
 it would come out later this year 

00:02:29.709 --> 00:02:35.139
 while the real novelty would be 

00:02:32.349 --> 00:02:37.689
 the next ipad hypothetically planned 

00:02:35.139 --> 00:02:40.989
 for 2014 that would increase the screen 

00:02:37.689 --> 00:02:45.939
 up to 12.9 inches and the resolution 

00:02:40.989 --> 00:02:48.250
 up to 2 thousand 732 x 2048 the ipad mini 

00:02:45.939 --> 00:02:50.919
 it would keep its size but its second 

00:02:48.250 --> 00:02:56.349
 version would make the screen from 7 to 9 

00:02:50.919 --> 00:03:01.090
 inches to be 1024 x 768 at a 

00:02:56.349 --> 00:03:03.549
 retina resolution of 2048 x 1536 the 

00:03:01.090 --> 00:03:05.709
 same as the current ipad of course 

00:03:03.549 --> 00:03:08.019
 Interesting facts are the products of 

00:03:05.709 --> 00:03:11.700
 apple had to evolve and from this 

00:03:08.019 --> 00:03:11.700
 way they will do it without any doubt
