documentary<00:00:52.269> about<00:00:52.870> this<00:00:54.059> fungus<00:00:55.059> called

00:00:55.290 --> 00:00:55.300 
documentary about this fungus called

00:00:55.300 --> 00:00:57.419 
documentary about this fungus called
cordyceps<00:00:55.719> and<00:00:56.170> the<00:00:56.589> way<00:00:56.680> that<00:00:56.829> fungus<00:00:57.159> works

00:00:57.419 --> 00:00:57.429 
cordyceps and the way that fungus works

00:00:57.429 --> 00:01:01.049 
cordyceps and the way that fungus works
is<00:00:57.699> it<00:00:58.589> it<00:00:59.589> infects<00:01:00.010> different<00:01:00.399> species<00:01:00.789> of

00:01:01.049 --> 00:01:01.059 
is it it infects different species of

00:01:01.059 --> 00:01:02.969 
is it it infects different species of
insects<00:01:01.539> that<00:01:01.690> fungus<00:01:02.109> develops<00:01:02.469> inside<00:01:02.589> them

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:02.979 
insects that fungus develops inside them

00:01:02.979 --> 00:01:04.619 
insects that fungus develops inside them
burrows<00:01:03.309> its<00:01:03.460> way<00:01:03.519> into<00:01:03.729> its<00:01:03.909> mine<00:01:04.119> and<00:01:04.449> take

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:04.629 
burrows its way into its mine and take

00:01:04.629 --> 00:01:07.529 
burrows its way into its mine and take
control<00:01:04.920> essentially<00:01:05.920> of<00:01:06.070> the<00:01:06.610> insect<00:01:07.030> what

00:01:07.529 --> 00:01:07.539 
control essentially of the insect what

00:01:07.539 --> 00:01:09.510 
control essentially of the insect what
if<00:01:07.630> this<00:01:07.750> thing<00:01:07.810> jumps<00:01:08.320> species<00:01:08.799> and<00:01:09.070> infected

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:09.520 
if this thing jumps species and infected

00:01:09.520 --> 00:01:12.270 
if this thing jumps species and infected
people<00:01:09.670> knows<00:01:10.030> the<00:01:10.330> earliest<00:01:10.780> inspiration<00:01:11.409> so

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:12.280 
people knows the earliest inspiration so

00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:13.859 
people knows the earliest inspiration so
that<00:01:12.490> was<00:01:12.610> a<00:01:12.640> really<00:01:12.940> beautiful<00:01:13.420> jumping<00:01:13.720> off

00:01:13.859 --> 00:01:13.869 
that was a really beautiful jumping off

00:01:13.869 --> 00:01:15.389 
that was a really beautiful jumping off
point<00:01:14.140> to<00:01:14.200> us<00:01:14.380> because<00:01:14.799> we<00:01:14.950> thought<00:01:15.159> we<00:01:15.280> could

00:01:15.389 --> 00:01:15.399 
point to us because we thought we could

00:01:15.399 --> 00:01:18.389 
point to us because we thought we could
do<00:01:15.490> something<00:01:15.820> unique<00:01:16.000> it<00:01:16.750> wasn't<00:01:17.170> just<00:01:17.399> your

00:01:18.389 --> 00:01:18.399 
do something unique it wasn't just your

00:01:18.399 --> 00:01:20.490 
do something unique it wasn't just your
typical<00:01:18.549> ambling<00:01:19.299> zombie<00:01:19.780> sort<00:01:20.080> of<00:01:20.140> thing<00:01:20.320> but

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:20.500 
typical ambling zombie sort of thing but

00:01:20.500 --> 00:01:22.020 
typical ambling zombie sort of thing but
we<00:01:20.590> can<00:01:20.680> actually<00:01:20.830> have<00:01:21.130> some<00:01:21.369> science<00:01:21.729> behind

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:22.030 
we can actually have some science behind

00:01:22.030 --> 00:01:23.880 
we can actually have some science behind
it<00:01:22.240> and<00:01:22.330> ground<00:01:22.539> these<00:01:22.750> things<00:01:23.050> and<00:01:23.679> we<00:01:23.740> don't

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:23.890 
it and ground these things and we don't

00:01:23.890 --> 00:01:25.529 
it and ground these things and we don't
want<00:01:24.009> to<00:01:24.039> just<00:01:24.220> make<00:01:24.340> the<00:01:24.429> typical<00:01:24.610> like<00:01:24.909> rule

00:01:25.529 --> 00:01:25.539 
want to just make the typical like rule

00:01:25.539 --> 00:01:27.540 
want to just make the typical like rule
we<00:01:26.409> want<00:01:26.470> actually<00:01:26.679> bring<00:01:27.100> the<00:01:27.280> fact<00:01:27.460> that

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:27.550

00:01:46.469 --> 00:01:46.479 
a bit of vision so they could kind of

00:01:46.479 --> 00:01:48.210 
a bit of vision so they could kind of
see<00:01:46.690> if<00:01:46.840> you<00:01:46.929> move<00:01:47.049> around<00:01:47.200> you<00:01:47.409> have<00:01:47.470> to<00:01:47.679> kind

00:01:54.779 --> 00:01:54.789 
something that is stage three of the

00:01:54.789 --> 00:01:56.100 
something that is stage three of the
infection<00:01:55.179> or<00:01:55.300> what<00:01:55.390> they<00:01:55.479> call<00:01:55.629> the<00:01:55.750> clickers

00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:56.110 
infection or what they call the clickers

00:01:56.110 --> 00:01:58.350 
infection or what they call the clickers
which<00:01:56.770> is<00:01:56.920> using<00:01:57.190> echolocation<00:01:57.489> a<00:01:58.000> form<00:01:58.239> of

00:01:58.350 --> 00:01:58.360 
which is using echolocation a form of

00:01:58.360 --> 00:02:00.479 
which is using echolocation a form of
echolocation<00:01:58.479> and<00:01:59.140> then<00:01:59.560> the<00:01:59.679> clickers<00:02:00.039> it's

00:02:00.479 --> 00:02:00.489 
echolocation and then the clickers it's

00:02:00.489 --> 00:02:02.490 
echolocation and then the clickers it's
all<00:02:00.729> based<00:02:01.000> on<00:02:01.179> audio<00:02:01.539> so<00:02:02.050> you<00:02:02.110> have<00:02:02.229> to<00:02:02.349> make
