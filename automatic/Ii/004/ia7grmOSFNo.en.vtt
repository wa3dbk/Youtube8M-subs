then he started as he came out to hey it

00:04:10.209 --> 00:04:12.090 
then he started as he came out to hey it
was<00:04:10.300> quite<00:04:10.480> no<00:04:10.660> man's<00:04:10.870> land<00:04:10.989> he<00:04:11.590> came<00:04:11.830> out<00:04:11.860> to

was quite no man's land he came out to

00:04:12.100 --> 00:04:15.000 
was quite no man's land he came out to
the<00:04:12.220> top<00:04:12.400> of<00:04:12.430> the<00:04:12.580> box<00:04:12.790> and<00:04:13.000> any<00:04:13.180> stuff<00:04:13.450> I<00:04:14.010> think

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:15.010 
the top of the box and any stuff I think

00:04:15.010 --> 00:04:17.190 
the top of the box and any stuff I think
I<00:04:15.220> think<00:04:15.489> the<00:04:15.670> key<00:04:16.180> is<00:04:16.209> from<00:04:16.900> the<00:04:17.020> very

00:04:17.190 --> 00:04:17.200 
I think the key is from the very

00:04:17.200 --> 00:04:18.990 
I think the key is from the very
beginning<00:04:17.560> that<00:04:17.590> you<00:04:17.739> have<00:04:18.010> a<00:04:18.280> joint

00:04:18.990 --> 00:04:19.000 
beginning that you have a joint

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:21.030 
beginning that you have a joint
commitment<00:04:19.419> from<00:04:19.690> everybody<00:04:20.200> involved<00:04:20.530> that

00:04:21.030 --> 00:04:21.040 
commitment from everybody involved that

00:04:21.040 --> 00:04:22.980 
commitment from everybody involved that
it's<00:04:21.310> not<00:04:21.489> just<00:04:21.820> about<00:04:21.970> soccer<00:04:22.450> but<00:04:22.870> it's

00:04:22.980 --> 00:04:22.990 
it's not just about soccer but it's

00:04:22.990 --> 00:04:25.290 
it's not just about soccer but it's
about<00:04:23.200> bringing<00:04:23.380> communities<00:04:24.130> together<00:04:24.340> from

about bringing communities together from

00:04:25.300 --> 00:04:27.090 
about bringing communities together from
other<00:04:25.660> parts<00:04:25.990> of<00:04:26.080> the<00:04:26.140> world<00:04:26.200> as<00:04:26.680> well<00:04:26.890> as

00:04:36.629 --> 00:04:38.569 
different communities right here in New
York<00:04:36.749> I<00:04:37.169> think<00:04:37.769> we<00:04:37.860> can<00:04:37.979> feel<00:04:38.159> really<00:04:38.459> good

about<00:04:38.639> the<00:04:38.999> way<00:04:39.119> this<00:04:39.389> year's<00:04:39.929> tournament<00:04:40.289> has

00:04:40.609 --> 00:04:40.619

about the way this year's tournament has
gone<00:04:40.949> and<00:04:41.279> I<00:04:41.369> think<00:04:41.639> that<00:04:41.759> that<00:04:41.789> would

00:04:42.049 --> 00:04:42.059 
gone and I think that that would

00:04:42.059 --> 00:04:44.089 
gone and I think that that would
certainly<00:04:42.449> be<00:04:42.629> an<00:04:42.779> encouraging<00:04:43.289> part<00:04:43.559> if<00:04:43.829> we

00:04:44.089 --> 00:04:44.099 
certainly be an encouraging part if we

00:04:44.099 --> 00:04:45.259 
certainly be an encouraging part if we
were<00:04:44.219> to<00:04:44.339> sit<00:04:44.519> down<00:04:44.639> and<00:04:44.789> talk<00:04:44.939> about<00:04:45.239> a
