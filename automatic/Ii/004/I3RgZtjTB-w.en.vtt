00:00:11.749 --> 00:00:15.429
 Welcome to Capo for a long time and today hewlett-packards 9 

00:00:15.429 --> 00:00:19.779
 Large format printers who totally look outside 304 with Pinera 

00:00:19.779 --> 00:00:22.339
 a device with integrated Toko and scanner 

00:00:22.339 --> 00:00:25.099
 offered in the variant as bot 

00:00:25.099 --> 00:00:27.249
 Hanover lni 

00:00:27.249 --> 00:00:31.289
 Autohaus Healthy Tissue Built Vice-Irish Work Worry Full Tilt 

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:35.290
 very satisfied that has been able to build up quite fast 

00:00:35.290 --> 00:00:38.650
 and then the device can be completely self-explanatory 

00:00:38.650 --> 00:00:42.210
 also front about an hour and then it is like now if not 

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:44.190
 completely finished ready for use 

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:46.390
 he is already very promising 

00:00:46.390 --> 00:00:49.390
 Homburger he wants to be very happy 

00:01:41.470 --> 00:01:44.470
 5 

00:01:46.980 --> 00:01:48.550
 for that is formally the 

00:01:48.550 --> 00:01:51.730
 the long hood for this expression before 

00:01:51.730 --> 00:01:53.140
 lasted 

00:01:53.140 --> 00:01:56.690
 Prock well asked if they have been stopped enough 

00:01:56.690 --> 00:01:59.930
 it was unclear over 90 seconds so go 

00:01:59.930 --> 00:02:01.520
 blithely chewing down the valley 

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:04.310
 the parity one married couple fast 

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:05.690
 So so 

00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:07.949
 according to the speed 

00:02:07.949 --> 00:02:10.019
 optimal 

00:02:10.019 --> 00:02:12.870
 I have it looking when I use different formats with the device 

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:13.959
 to press 

00:02:13.959 --> 00:02:17.899
 that's just percent think something like 2 whether we want 

00:02:17.899 --> 00:02:21.029
 just like Matter, for example, you can want different widths 

00:02:21.029 --> 00:02:24.559
 then the device automatically searches for the roll that fits to the format 

00:02:25.859 --> 00:02:27.650
 whether certain really easier 

00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:31.830
 Mr. Mehdorn and different types of paper also print Courtesy 

00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:35.730
 From there, percent fired when we printed the stick from Conze 

00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:39.280
 Example percent indicate if goalkeeper Marisa Brunner is 2008 

00:02:40.859 --> 00:02:43.699
 The crew members would always post for a haircut, too 

00:02:43.699 --> 00:02:44.539
 like 

00:02:44.539 --> 00:02:45.420
 for example 

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:49.970
 So advertise that percent plain paper and pick paper and then off in 

00:02:49.970 --> 00:02:53.530
 tested the lesson for all possibilities which here more percent 

00:02:53.530 --> 00:02:56.529
 we noticed we were complete the whole time 

00:02:56.529 --> 00:02:59.980
 worked without a bill that if you just the moment the conduit 2 Munz with 

00:02:59.979 --> 00:03:02.619
 the machine is busy without a network without anything 

00:03:02.619 --> 00:03:05.629
 and the centership a story ago 

00:03:05.629 --> 00:03:07.909
 but now there is another source on Linux too 

00:03:07.909 --> 00:03:10.909
 by percent where money can be scanned, for example 

00:03:12.029 --> 00:03:13.709
 according to o 

00:03:13.709 --> 00:03:15.789
 that aloud if that was her 

00:03:15.789 --> 00:03:20.119
 in addition to the usb-stick also know in Ston network of course 

00:03:20.119 --> 00:03:21.599
 and additionally 

00:03:21.599 --> 00:03:23.909
 on Tauss or in the Cloud 

00:03:23.909 --> 00:03:27.039
 who claim the main line brings little empty 

00:03:27.039 --> 00:03:28.119
 No 

00:03:28.119 --> 00:03:30.529
 and we can put our plans there 

00:03:30.529 --> 00:03:33.529
 the children of the EU and IMF Bali have been 

00:03:34.379 --> 00:03:37.049
 Greiz think more of those of the architects 

00:03:37.049 --> 00:03:41.539
 that is on his way from his office or in his office 

00:03:41.539 --> 00:03:45.179
 to go to colleagues or, for example, late to the construction site now 

00:03:45.179 --> 00:03:49.739
 that, of course, is invaluable, so either you steal it today 

00:03:49.739 --> 00:03:51.959
 or above the level the stick 

00:03:51.959 --> 00:03:53.539
 as you are yes 

00:03:53.539 --> 00:03:54.719
 Felix 

00:03:54.719 --> 00:03:56.219
 that was rejected by the councils 

00:03:56.219 --> 00:04:00.430
 Hop gardener still saved a major job as I do not believe that 

00:04:00.430 --> 00:04:05.319
 Plastic pilot at 60 gigabyte Lotte pilot one is it is certainly so 

00:04:05.319 --> 00:04:08.229
 knew mosque was at least a passage not full text 

00:04:08.229 --> 00:04:12.299
 So he plans the reason landing pages Contract with some People 

00:04:12.299 --> 00:04:15.899
 about what is quite enough percent to copy then ultimately 

00:04:16.489 --> 00:04:19.229
 for trial sitting in Belgrade 

00:04:19.229 --> 00:04:22.199
 and I welcome 

00:04:22.199 --> 00:04:24.340
 Percent while given in the middle 

00:04:24.340 --> 00:04:25.969
 Prof 

00:04:25.969 --> 00:04:28.610
 at first glance it is indistinguishable 

00:04:28.610 --> 00:04:29.729
 percent 

00:04:29.729 --> 00:04:32.729
 Original and fake 

00:04:33.240 --> 00:04:35.320
 just so the seat blockers are good enough 

00:04:35.320 --> 00:04:39.470
 Round table laid the taxes here is now Halliwell the interfaces 

00:04:39.470 --> 00:04:41.969
 features in these devices 

00:04:41.969 --> 00:04:44.720
 So for example, applicants 

00:04:44.720 --> 00:04:47.639
 Percent the usb interface 

00:04:47.639 --> 00:04:48.710
 Prof 

00:04:48.710 --> 00:04:51.110
 Klumpp formerly committed to feel 

00:04:51.110 --> 00:04:56.219
 Young people had run and be booked through a modern 

00:04:56.219 --> 00:04:59.610
 the much deeper especially bitter is that too 

00:04:59.610 --> 00:05:02.699
 already five games with which many of their money during Mozilo 

00:05:03.360 --> 00:05:06.710
 that and convinced 

00:05:06.710 --> 00:05:09.259
 enjoy the good reputation through mobile 

00:05:09.259 --> 00:05:12.259
 something must also be clear 

00:05:13.909 --> 00:05:16.909
 Dublin 

00:05:28.110 --> 00:05:28.879
