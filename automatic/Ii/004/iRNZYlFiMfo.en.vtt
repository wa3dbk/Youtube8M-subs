the<00:00:30.150> stipulation<00:00:30.720> i<00:00:30.840> like<00:00:30.990> the<00:00:31.140> uniting<00:00:31.500> of

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:31.560 
the stipulation i like the uniting of

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:34.130 
the stipulation i like the uniting of
this<00:00:31.710> it<00:00:32.219> kind<00:00:32.520> of<00:00:32.640> makes<00:00:33.120> sort<00:00:33.540> of<00:00:33.690> sense<00:00:33.930> cuz

00:00:34.130 --> 00:00:34.140 
this it kind of makes sort of sense cuz

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:36.020 
this it kind of makes sort of sense cuz
you<00:00:34.290> know<00:00:34.590> stings<00:00:35.190> at<00:00:35.370> the<00:00:35.460> twilight<00:00:35.910> of<00:00:35.940> his

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:36.030 
you know stings at the twilight of his

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:38.209 
you know stings at the twilight of his
career<00:00:36.270> so<00:00:36.660> I<00:00:36.960> think<00:00:37.200> sooner<00:00:37.739> rather<00:00:38.010> than

00:00:38.209 --> 00:00:38.219 
career so I think sooner rather than

00:00:38.219 --> 00:00:40.369 
career so I think sooner rather than
later<00:00:38.280> he<00:00:38.700> will<00:00:38.940> you<00:00:39.690> know<00:00:39.719> be<00:00:39.989> done<00:00:40.170> with

00:00:40.369 --> 00:00:40.379 
later he will you know be done with

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:42.619 
later he will you know be done with
wrestling<00:00:40.739> completely<00:00:41.219> I<00:00:41.730> like<00:00:42.180> the<00:00:42.300> idea<00:00:42.420> of

00:00:42.619 --> 00:00:42.629 
wrestling completely I like the idea of

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:44.360 
wrestling completely I like the idea of
him<00:00:42.750> not<00:00:42.989> have<00:00:43.170> being<00:00:43.620> able<00:00:43.890> to<00:00:43.980> compete<00:00:44.219> for

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:44.370 
him not have being able to compete for

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:46.850 
him not have being able to compete for
the<00:00:44.460> title<00:00:44.610> again<00:00:45.000> and<00:00:45.180> actually<00:00:45.660> maybe<00:00:46.020> use

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:46.860 
the title again and actually maybe use

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:48.799 
the title again and actually maybe use
further<00:00:47.190> down<00:00:47.670> the<00:00:47.850> line<00:00:48.030> to<00:00:48.270> help<00:00:48.450> enhance

00:00:48.799 --> 00:00:48.809 
further down the line to help enhance

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:51.020 
further down the line to help enhance
talent<00:00:49.379> mm-hmm<00:00:49.890> and<00:00:50.010> it<00:00:50.160> creates<00:00:50.730> kind<00:00:50.879> of

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:51.030 
talent mm-hmm and it creates kind of

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:52.549 
talent mm-hmm and it creates kind of
that<00:00:51.149> sympathy<00:00:51.629> factor<00:00:51.780> here's<00:00:52.170> this<00:00:52.320> guy<00:00:52.500> who

00:00:52.549 --> 00:00:52.559 
that sympathy factor here's this guy who

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:54.290 
that sympathy factor here's this guy who
doesn't<00:00:52.920> have<00:00:53.160> to<00:00:53.219> retire<00:00:53.579> and<00:00:53.820> it's<00:00:53.910> not<00:00:54.090> like

00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:54.300 
doesn't have to retire and it's not like

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:55.279 
doesn't have to retire and it's not like
we're<00:00:54.449> trying<00:00:54.600> to<00:00:54.660> sell<00:00:54.870> people<00:00:55.050> on<00:00:55.230> a

00:00:55.279 --> 00:00:55.289 
we're trying to sell people on a

00:00:55.289 --> 00:00:57.500 
we're trying to sell people on a
retirement<00:00:55.920> stipulation<00:00:56.610> for<00:00:56.640> the<00:00:56.910> ten

00:00:57.500 --> 00:00:57.510 
retirement stipulation for the ten

00:00:57.510 --> 00:00:59.060 
retirement stipulation for the ten
millionth<00:00:57.719> time<00:00:58.020> but<00:00:58.379> nonetheless<00:00:58.559> it's

00:00:59.060 --> 00:00:59.070 
millionth time but nonetheless it's

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:00.740 
millionth time but nonetheless it's
something<00:00:59.399> that<00:00:59.520> I<00:00:59.550> think<00:00:59.640> people<00:01:00.030> can

00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:00.750 
something that I think people can

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:02.119 
something that I think people can
actually<00:01:00.930> believe<00:01:01.530> that<00:01:01.800> there<00:01:01.980> could<00:01:02.100> be

00:01:02.119 --> 00:01:02.129 
actually believe that there could be

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:03.609 
actually believe that there could be
consequences<00:01:02.789> from<00:01:03.000> this<00:01:03.210> stipulation

00:01:03.609 --> 00:01:03.619

00:03:09.629 --> 00:03:09.639 
singles matches i don't mind the

00:03:09.639 --> 00:03:12.089 
singles matches i don't mind the
occasional<00:03:10.349> triple<00:03:11.349> threat<00:03:11.620> or<00:03:11.769> three<00:03:11.980> way

00:03:42.479 --> 00:03:42.489 
meaning that whoever should have this X

00:03:42.489 --> 00:03:44.490 
meaning that whoever should have this X
Division<00:03:42.729> title<00:03:43.209> is<00:03:43.329> that<00:03:43.900> guy<00:03:44.079> you<00:03:44.139> really

00:03:44.490 --> 00:03:44.500 
Division title is that guy you really

00:03:44.500 --> 00:03:45.930 
Division title is that guy you really
want<00:03:44.799> to<00:03:44.919> kind<00:03:45.069> of<00:03:45.129> push<00:03:45.370> up<00:03:45.549> to<00:03:45.669> that<00:03:45.790> level

00:03:45.930 --> 00:03:45.940 
want to kind of push up to that level

00:03:45.940 --> 00:03:47.550 
want to kind of push up to that level
and<00:03:46.150> I<00:03:46.269> think<00:03:46.510> you<00:03:46.599> have<00:03:46.750> a<00:03:46.780> lot<00:03:47.079> of<00:03:47.139> potential

00:03:47.550 --> 00:03:47.560 
and I think you have a lot of potential

00:03:47.560 --> 00:03:49.949 
and I think you have a lot of potential
here<00:03:47.739> with<00:03:48.280> Chris<00:03:48.549> Sabin<00:03:48.790> it's<00:03:49.120> a<00:03:49.180> great<00:03:49.510> story

00:03:49.949 --> 00:03:49.959 
here with Chris Sabin it's a great story

00:03:49.959 --> 00:03:51.240 
here with Chris Sabin it's a great story
he's<00:03:50.169> coming<00:03:50.440> back<00:03:50.530> from<00:03:50.709> two<00:03:50.949> years

00:03:51.240 --> 00:03:51.250 
he's coming back from two years

00:03:51.250 --> 00:03:53.219 
he's coming back from two years
essentially<00:03:51.729> on<00:03:52.000> the<00:03:52.150> shelf<00:03:52.389> and<00:03:52.629> I<00:03:53.049> think

00:03:53.219 --> 00:03:53.229 
essentially on the shelf and I think

00:03:53.229 --> 00:03:54.689 
essentially on the shelf and I think
it's<00:03:53.349> something<00:03:53.500> people<00:03:53.709> resonate<00:03:54.099> with<00:03:54.459> and

00:03:54.689 --> 00:03:54.699 
it's something people resonate with and

00:03:54.699 --> 00:03:56.280 
it's something people resonate with and
he<00:03:54.760> is<00:03:54.849> someone<00:03:55.150> that<00:03:55.180> he's<00:03:55.599> a<00:03:55.629> fresh<00:03:56.019> face

00:03:56.280 --> 00:03:56.290 
he is someone that he's a fresh face

00:03:56.290 --> 00:03:58.469 
he is someone that he's a fresh face
that<00:03:56.620> you<00:03:56.709> could<00:03:56.919> propel<00:03:57.310> up<00:03:57.459> there<00:03:57.729> but<00:03:58.239> my

00:03:58.469 --> 00:03:58.479 
that you could propel up there but my

00:03:58.479 --> 00:04:00.899 
that you could propel up there but my
optimism<00:03:59.109> is<00:03:59.409> somewhat<00:03:59.799> reserved<00:04:00.280> yeah<00:04:00.699> i

00:04:00.899 --> 00:04:00.909 
optimism is somewhat reserved yeah i

00:04:00.909 --> 00:04:02.610 
optimism is somewhat reserved yeah i
agree<00:04:01.060> Chris<00:04:01.479> Sabin<00:04:01.690> is<00:04:01.930> a<00:04:01.959> guy<00:04:02.139> I<00:04:02.169> think<00:04:02.500> that

00:04:02.610 --> 00:04:02.620 
agree Chris Sabin is a guy I think that

00:04:02.620 --> 00:04:05.159 
agree Chris Sabin is a guy I think that

holding my breath on that one and it's a

00:04:36.660 --> 00:04:38.600 
holding my breath on that one and it's a
very<00:04:36.690> weird<00:04:37.110> circumstance<00:04:37.800> with<00:04:38.010> with<00:04:38.400> Jeff
