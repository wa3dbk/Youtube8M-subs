00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:41.630 
and you get an a user guide here you
know<00:01:40.320> there's<00:01:40.650> not<00:01:40.799> a<00:01:40.860> lot<00:01:41.100> of<00:01:41.130> modes<00:01:41.460> or

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:41.640 
know there's not a lot of modes or

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:42.859 
know there's not a lot of modes or
anything<00:01:41.759> like<00:01:42.000> that<00:01:42.060> on<00:01:42.299> the<00:01:42.420> light<00:01:42.570> itself

00:01:42.859 --> 00:01:42.869 
anything like that on the light itself

00:01:42.869 --> 00:01:44.539 
anything like that on the light itself
so<00:01:43.110> it's<00:01:43.229> pretty<00:01:43.350> self-explanatory<00:01:43.740> it<00:01:44.369> just

00:01:44.539 --> 00:01:44.549 
so it's pretty self-explanatory it just

00:01:44.549 --> 00:01:46.490 
so it's pretty self-explanatory it just
tells<00:01:44.729> you<00:01:44.850> how<00:01:44.970> to<00:01:45.030> you<00:01:46.020> know<00:01:46.049> install<00:01:46.409> the

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:46.500 
tells you how to you know install the

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:48.950 
tells you how to you know install the
batteries<00:01:46.920> and<00:01:47.250> the<00:01:47.460> operation<00:01:48.000> so<00:01:48.540> we'll<00:01:48.810> put

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:48.960 
batteries and the operation so we'll put

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:51.020 
batteries and the operation so we'll put
that<00:01:48.990> to<00:01:49.200> the<00:01:49.259> side<00:01:49.490> let's<00:01:50.490> go<00:01:50.610> ahead<00:01:50.700> and<00:01:50.909> take

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:51.030 
that to the side let's go ahead and take

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:52.850 
that to the side let's go ahead and take
a<00:01:51.060> look<00:01:51.210> at<00:01:51.329> the<00:01:51.420> light<00:01:51.570> itself<00:01:51.899> before<00:01:52.500> we<00:01:52.680> put

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:52.860 
a look at the light itself before we put

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:54.010 
a look at the light itself before we put
the<00:01:52.920> batteries<00:01:53.280> in

00:01:54.010 --> 00:01:54.020 
the batteries in

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:58.459 
the batteries in
again<00:01:55.020> it's<00:01:55.229> machined<00:01:55.619> out<00:01:55.770> of<00:01:57.110> aluminum<00:01:58.110> so

00:01:58.459 --> 00:01:58.469 
again it's machined out of aluminum so

00:01:58.469 --> 00:01:59.929 
again it's machined out of aluminum so
it's<00:01:58.680> it's<00:01:59.070> pretty<00:01:59.340> nice<00:01:59.490> it's<00:01:59.729> very

00:01:59.929 --> 00:01:59.939 
it's it's pretty nice it's very

00:01:59.939 --> 00:02:02.389 
it's it's pretty nice it's very
lightweight<00:02:00.210> I<00:02:00.689> like<00:02:01.649> the<00:02:01.770> feel<00:02:02.009> the<00:02:02.219> light

00:02:02.389 --> 00:02:02.399 
lightweight I like the feel the light

00:02:02.399 --> 00:02:03.950 
lightweight I like the feel the light
itself<00:02:02.700> it's<00:02:02.939> got<00:02:03.090> these<00:02:03.270> these<00:02:03.810> little

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:03.960 
itself it's got these these little

itself it's got these these little
knurlings<00:02:04.530> on<00:02:04.680> it<00:02:04.890> so<00:02:05.189> it<00:02:05.340> provides<00:02:05.939> really

00:02:06.230 --> 00:02:06.240 
knurlings on it so it provides really

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:07.639 
knurlings on it so it provides really

00:02:20.380 --> 00:02:20.390 
if you're gonna take this off to install

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:21.699 
if you're gonna take this off to install
the<00:02:20.540> batteries<00:02:20.900> and<00:02:21.050> stuff<00:02:21.200> like<00:02:21.319> that<00:02:21.500> your

00:02:21.699 --> 00:02:21.709 
the batteries and stuff like that your

00:02:21.709 --> 00:02:23.350 
the batteries and stuff like that your
your<00:02:22.190> hands<00:02:22.370> and<00:02:22.550> isn't<00:02:22.700> gonna<00:02:22.790> be<00:02:22.940> slipping

00:02:23.350 --> 00:02:23.360

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:25.570 
your hands and isn't gonna be slipping
it<00:02:23.900> also<00:02:24.050> shows<00:02:24.410> you<00:02:24.620> the<00:02:24.650> direction<00:02:25.430> of<00:02:25.489> the

00:02:25.570 --> 00:02:25.580 
it also shows you the direction of the

00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:26.860 
it also shows you the direction of the
batteries<00:02:26.000> how<00:02:26.120> they<00:02:26.239> should<00:02:26.420> go<00:02:26.540> in<00:02:26.690> there

00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:26.870 
batteries how they should go in there

00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:29.020 
batteries how they should go in there
what<00:02:27.560> I<00:02:27.590> really<00:02:27.890> liked<00:02:28.069> is<00:02:28.220> the<00:02:28.459> the<00:02:28.819> actual

00:02:29.020 --> 00:02:29.030 
what I really liked is the the actual

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:31.479 
what I really liked is the the actual
tail<00:02:29.300> caps<00:02:29.540> which<00:02:29.810> it<00:02:30.140> protrudes<00:02:30.980> a<00:02:31.250> little

00:02:31.479 --> 00:02:31.489 
tail caps which it protrudes a little

00:02:31.489 --> 00:02:33.640 
tail caps which it protrudes a little
bit<00:02:31.610> so<00:02:31.940> it<00:02:32.090> makes<00:02:32.300> it<00:02:32.420> easier<00:02:32.810> to<00:02:32.870> actuate

00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:33.650 
bit so it makes it easier to actuate

00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:35.199 
bit so it makes it easier to actuate
whenever<00:02:34.100> you're<00:02:34.250> gonna<00:02:34.370> go<00:02:34.520> use<00:02:34.760> it<00:02:34.970> and

00:02:35.199 --> 00:02:35.209 
whenever you're gonna go use it and

00:02:35.209 --> 00:02:37.059 
whenever you're gonna go use it and
because<00:02:35.780> it<00:02:35.930> does<00:02:36.050> have<00:02:36.230> the<00:02:36.350> momentary<00:02:36.860> on

00:02:37.059 --> 00:02:37.069 
because it does have the momentary on

00:02:37.069 --> 00:02:40.270 
because it does have the momentary on
the<00:02:37.580> fact<00:02:37.819> that<00:02:37.880> it<00:02:38.090> it's<00:02:38.480> not<00:02:38.599> flat<00:02:39.200> it<00:02:39.590> kind

00:02:40.270 --> 00:02:40.280 
the fact that it it's not flat it kind

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:43.059 
the fact that it it's not flat it kind
of<00:02:40.340> helps<00:02:40.640> you<00:02:40.870> it<00:02:41.870> be<00:02:42.110> more<00:02:42.350> tactile<00:02:42.769> when<00:02:42.950> you

00:02:43.059 --> 00:02:43.069 
of helps you it be more tactile when you

00:02:43.069 --> 00:02:45.640 
of helps you it be more tactile when you
use<00:02:43.280> it<00:02:43.459> and<00:02:44.090> it<00:02:44.180> also<00:02:44.330> has<00:02:44.630> the<00:02:44.870> spring<00:02:45.440> clip

00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:45.650 
use it and it also has the spring clip

00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:48.940 
use it and it also has the spring clip
here<00:02:45.940> it<00:02:46.940> resembles<00:02:47.510> the<00:02:47.870> clip<00:02:48.080> of<00:02:48.200> a<00:02:48.290> pen<00:02:48.530> so

00:02:48.940 --> 00:02:48.950 
here it resembles the clip of a pen so

00:02:48.950 --> 00:02:51.130 
here it resembles the clip of a pen so
in<00:02:49.459> all<00:02:49.640> actuality<00:02:49.790> when<00:02:50.420> you<00:02:50.510> have<00:02:50.720> this<00:02:50.900> if

00:02:51.130 --> 00:02:51.140 
in all actuality when you have this if

00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:52.630 
in all actuality when you have this if
you<00:02:51.230> were<00:02:51.319> to<00:02:51.440> have<00:02:51.530> this<00:02:51.709> clipped<00:02:52.069> onto<00:02:52.250> let's

00:02:52.630 --> 00:02:52.640 
you were to have this clipped onto let's

00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:55.059 
you were to have this clipped onto let's
say<00:02:52.850> a<00:02:53.209> shirt<00:02:53.630> pocket<00:02:53.870> it<00:02:54.440> definitely<00:02:54.890> has

00:02:55.059 --> 00:02:55.069 
say a shirt pocket it definitely has

00:02:55.069 --> 00:02:57.400 
say a shirt pocket it definitely has
that<00:02:55.610> kind<00:02:55.910> of<00:02:56.000> pen<00:02:56.209> look<00:02:56.480> to<00:02:56.690> it<00:02:56.870> as<00:02:57.019> opposed

00:02:57.400 --> 00:02:57.410 
that kind of pen look to it as opposed

00:02:57.410 --> 00:02:59.080 
that kind of pen look to it as opposed
to<00:02:57.500> some<00:02:57.709> other<00:02:57.799> flashlights<00:02:58.700> that<00:02:58.850> we<00:02:58.940> seen

00:02:59.080 --> 00:02:59.090 
to some other flashlights that we seen

00:02:59.090 --> 00:03:00.910 
to some other flashlights that we seen
in<00:02:59.180> the<00:02:59.269> past<00:02:59.480> so<00:03:00.170> let<00:03:00.410> me<00:03:00.470> go<00:03:00.590> ahead<00:03:00.680> and

00:03:00.910 --> 00:03:00.920 
in the past so let me go ahead and

00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:03.220 
in the past so let me go ahead and
install<00:03:01.100> the<00:03:01.310> batteries<00:03:01.750> so<00:03:02.750> you<00:03:02.840> guys<00:03:03.019> can

00:03:03.220 --> 00:03:03.230 
install the batteries so you guys can

00:03:03.230 --> 00:03:06.670 
install the batteries so you guys can

00:03:06.670 --> 00:03:06.680 
see now what really attracted me to this

00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:09.250 
see now what really attracted me to this
particular<00:03:07.220> light<00:03:07.430> is<00:03:07.640> one<00:03:08.450> the<00:03:08.750> fact<00:03:08.959> that<00:03:09.080> it

00:03:09.250 --> 00:03:09.260 
particular light is one the fact that it

00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:12.820 
particular light is one the fact that it
does<00:03:09.440> have<00:03:09.470> the<00:03:09.970> momentary<00:03:10.970> on<00:03:11.260> as<00:03:12.260> an<00:03:12.560> EDC

00:03:12.820 --> 00:03:12.830 
does have the momentary on as an EDC

00:03:12.830 --> 00:03:14.680 
does have the momentary on as an EDC
flashlight<00:03:13.519> I<00:03:13.730> always<00:03:14.299> prefer<00:03:14.660> the

00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:14.690

00:03:16.870 --> 00:03:16.880 
flashlights to have that just because

00:03:16.880 --> 00:03:18.880 
flashlights to have that just because
most<00:03:17.120> of<00:03:17.209> the<00:03:17.329> time<00:03:17.709> something<00:03:18.709> like<00:03:18.739> this

00:03:18.880 --> 00:03:18.890 
most of the time something like this

00:03:18.890 --> 00:03:20.830 
most of the time something like this
you're<00:03:19.760> not<00:03:19.910> going<00:03:20.090> to<00:03:20.150> be<00:03:20.239> using<00:03:20.690> it<00:03:20.810> for

00:03:20.830 --> 00:03:20.840 
you're not going to be using it for

00:03:20.840 --> 00:03:23.410 
you're not going to be using it for
quite<00:03:21.380> a<00:03:21.410> long<00:03:21.680> time<00:03:21.980> so<00:03:22.459> if<00:03:22.880> you<00:03:23.000> just<00:03:23.209> need<00:03:23.359> a

00:03:23.410 --> 00:03:23.420 
quite a long time so if you just need a

00:03:23.420 --> 00:03:24.819 
quite a long time so if you just need a
couple<00:03:23.660> seconds<00:03:24.109> to<00:03:24.290> throw<00:03:24.470> a<00:03:24.500> light<00:03:24.680> on

00:03:24.819 --> 00:03:24.829 
couple seconds to throw a light on

00:03:24.829 --> 00:03:26.830 
couple seconds to throw a light on
something<00:03:25.070> that<00:03:25.850> momentary<00:03:26.450> on<00:03:26.600> feature

00:03:26.830 --> 00:03:26.840 
something that momentary on feature

00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:29.979 
something that momentary on feature
definitely<00:03:27.470> helps<00:03:27.829> I<00:03:28.760> also<00:03:29.120> like<00:03:29.390> the<00:03:29.600> the

00:03:29.979 --> 00:03:29.989 
definitely helps I also like the the

00:03:29.989 --> 00:03:33.340 
definitely helps I also like the the
fact<00:03:30.260> that<00:03:30.350> it<00:03:30.560> wasn't<00:03:30.829> that<00:03:31.790> big<00:03:32.600> so<00:03:33.200> it

00:03:33.340 --> 00:03:33.350 
fact that it wasn't that big so it

00:03:33.350 --> 00:03:34.930 
fact that it wasn't that big so it
definitely<00:03:33.530> fits<00:03:33.950> into<00:03:34.190> a<00:03:34.220> pocket<00:03:34.489> really

00:03:34.930 --> 00:03:34.940 
definitely fits into a pocket really

00:03:34.940 --> 00:03:37.120 
definitely fits into a pocket really
nicely<00:03:35.150> so<00:03:35.359> there<00:03:36.260> you<00:03:36.380> go<00:03:36.500> the<00:03:36.650> batteries<00:03:36.980> are

00:03:37.120 --> 00:03:37.130 
nicely so there you go the batteries are

00:03:37.130 --> 00:03:39.190 
nicely so there you go the batteries are
installed<00:03:37.459> so<00:03:37.730> once<00:03:38.420> you<00:03:38.600> know<00:03:38.720> you<00:03:38.780> lightly

00:03:39.190 --> 00:03:39.200 
installed so once you know you lightly

00:03:39.200 --> 00:03:41.770 
installed so once you know you lightly
press<00:03:39.350> it<00:03:39.560> you<00:03:39.769> get<00:03:40.040> the<00:03:40.190> light<00:03:40.400> and<00:03:40.670> if<00:03:41.630> you

00:03:41.770 --> 00:03:41.780 
press it you get the light and if you

00:03:41.780 --> 00:03:44.069 
press it you get the light and if you
hard<00:03:42.109> click<00:03:42.350> it<00:03:42.530> you<00:03:43.250> get<00:03:43.400> the<00:03:43.489> constant<00:03:43.940> on

00:03:44.069 --> 00:03:44.079 
hard click it you get the constant on

00:03:44.079 --> 00:03:47.020 
hard click it you get the constant on
now<00:03:45.079> I'm<00:03:45.290> I<00:03:45.650> prefer<00:03:46.190> lights<00:03:46.489> that<00:03:46.730> don't<00:03:46.910> have

00:03:47.020 --> 00:03:47.030 
now I'm I prefer lights that don't have

00:03:47.030 --> 00:03:49.569 
now I'm I prefer lights that don't have
a<00:03:47.060> lot<00:03:47.390> of<00:03:47.420> modes<00:03:47.780> just<00:03:48.260> because<00:03:48.890> normally<00:03:49.519> I

00:03:49.569 --> 00:03:49.579 
a lot of modes just because normally I

00:03:49.579 --> 00:03:51.880 
a lot of modes just because normally I
end<00:03:49.850> up<00:03:49.970> fine<00:03:50.630> I<00:03:50.810> find<00:03:51.200> that<00:03:51.320> I<00:03:51.380> end<00:03:51.590> up<00:03:51.680> using

00:03:51.880 --> 00:03:51.890 
end up fine I find that I end up using

00:03:51.890 --> 00:03:54.340 
end up fine I find that I end up using
either<00:03:52.519> the<00:03:52.880> high<00:03:53.090> mode<00:03:53.420> or<00:03:53.630> the<00:03:53.750> turbo<00:03:54.109> mode

00:03:54.340 --> 00:03:54.350 
either the high mode or the turbo mode

00:03:54.350 --> 00:03:55.809 
either the high mode or the turbo mode
and<00:03:54.560> most<00:03:54.739> lights<00:03:55.010> so<00:03:55.190> I<00:03:55.250> don't<00:03:55.430> really<00:03:55.489> need<00:03:55.760> a

00:03:55.809 --> 00:03:55.819 
and most lights so I don't really need a

00:03:55.819 --> 00:03:58.270 
and most lights so I don't really need a
medium<00:03:56.299> or<00:03:56.450> low<00:03:56.660> and<00:03:57.019> I<00:03:57.590> don't<00:03:57.620> really<00:03:57.950> need

00:03:58.270 --> 00:03:58.280 
medium or low and I don't really need

00:03:58.280 --> 00:04:00.910 
medium or low and I don't really need
strobe<00:03:58.790> and<00:03:59.000> if<00:03:59.239> I<00:03:59.359> were<00:03:59.569> in<00:03:59.600> each<00:03:59.900> slope<00:04:00.260> you

00:04:00.910 --> 00:04:00.920 
strobe and if I were in each slope you

00:04:00.920 --> 00:04:02.590 
strobe and if I were in each slope you
know<00:04:01.010> because<00:04:01.489> it<00:04:01.609> has<00:04:01.730> the<00:04:01.850> momentary<00:04:02.299> on<00:04:02.450> you

00:04:02.590 --> 00:04:02.600 
know because it has the momentary on you

00:04:02.600 --> 00:04:04.360 
know because it has the momentary on you
can<00:04:02.750> actually<00:04:03.079> press<00:04:03.319> it<00:04:03.440> yourself<00:04:03.829> and<00:04:04.069> it'll

00:04:04.360 --> 00:04:04.370 
can actually press it yourself and it'll

00:04:04.370 --> 00:04:06.520 
can actually press it yourself and it'll
create<00:04:04.670> a<00:04:04.760> strobe<00:04:05.120> light<00:04:05.209> so<00:04:05.600> I<00:04:05.810> figured<00:04:06.410> that

00:04:06.520 --> 00:04:06.530 
create a strobe light so I figured that

00:04:06.530 --> 00:04:08.650 
create a strobe light so I figured that
was<00:04:06.650> pretty<00:04:06.889> good<00:04:07.100> now<00:04:07.700> by<00:04:07.940> way<00:04:08.090> of<00:04:08.120> comparison

00:04:08.650 --> 00:04:08.660 
was pretty good now by way of comparison

00:04:08.660 --> 00:04:11.050 
was pretty good now by way of comparison
now<00:04:08.900> I'll<00:04:09.590> show<00:04:09.829> another<00:04:09.859> light<00:04:10.310> here<00:04:10.639> this<00:04:10.850> is

00:04:11.050 --> 00:04:11.060 
now I'll show another light here this is

00:04:11.060 --> 00:04:14.289 
now I'll show another light here this is
the<00:04:11.319> stream<00:04:12.319> light<00:04:12.560> stylist<00:04:13.340> pro<00:04:13.609> so

00:04:14.289 --> 00:04:14.299 
the stream light stylist pro so

00:04:14.299 --> 00:04:15.400 
the stream light stylist pro so
obviously<00:04:14.630> you<00:04:14.720> guys<00:04:14.810> can<00:04:15.019> see<00:04:15.170> it's<00:04:15.319> very

00:04:15.400 --> 00:04:15.410 
obviously you guys can see it's very

00:04:15.410 --> 00:04:17.890 
obviously you guys can see it's very
very<00:04:15.950> similar<00:04:16.579> to<00:04:16.729> it<00:04:17.060> it<00:04:17.269> is<00:04:17.539> a<00:04:17.690> little

00:04:17.890 --> 00:04:17.900 
very similar to it it is a little

00:04:17.900 --> 00:04:21.370 
very similar to it it is a little
smaller<00:04:18.409> which<00:04:19.099> is<00:04:19.280> nice<00:04:19.549> because<00:04:20.450> it<00:04:20.989> does

00:04:21.370 --> 00:04:21.380 
smaller which is nice because it does

00:04:21.380 --> 00:04:22.390 
smaller which is nice because it does
have<00:04:21.530> a<00:04:21.590> little<00:04:21.769> bit<00:04:21.859> more<00:04:22.099> of<00:04:22.190> a

00:04:22.390 --> 00:04:22.400 
have a little bit more of a

00:04:22.400 --> 00:04:24.580 
have a little bit more of a
compact<00:04:22.759> size<00:04:22.970> to<00:04:23.330> it<00:04:23.509> but<00:04:23.960> it<00:04:24.050> does<00:04:24.229> have<00:04:24.259> more

00:04:24.580 --> 00:04:24.590 
compact size to it but it does have more

00:04:24.590 --> 00:04:27.070 
compact size to it but it does have more
luminous<00:04:25.009> than<00:04:25.160> the<00:04:25.220> stylist<00:04:25.729> Pro<00:04:25.940> now<00:04:26.570> I

00:04:38.200 --> 00:04:38.210 
are obviously great EDC lights but what

00:04:38.210 --> 00:04:41.230 
are obviously great EDC lights but what
I<00:04:38.240> find<00:04:38.539> myself<00:04:38.720> is<00:04:39.320> that<00:04:40.160> after<00:04:41.000> using

00:04:41.230 --> 00:04:41.240 
I find myself is that after using

00:04:41.240 --> 00:04:42.730 
I find myself is that after using
certain<00:04:41.750> other<00:04:41.900> lights<00:04:42.169> that<00:04:42.350> have<00:04:42.500> more

00:04:42.730 --> 00:04:42.740 
certain other lights that have more

00:04:42.740 --> 00:04:46.180 
certain other lights that have more
lumens<00:04:43.250> I<00:04:43.970> end<00:04:44.360> up<00:04:44.570> wanting<00:04:45.080> you<00:04:45.770> know<00:04:45.800> a<00:04:45.889> light

that's gonna you know be a little

00:04:48.139 --> 00:04:49.990 
that's gonna you know be a little
brighter<00:04:48.380> so<00:04:48.740> here<00:04:49.430> they<00:04:49.580> are<00:04:49.610> side-by-side

00:04:49.990 --> 00:04:50.000

lumens<00:05:00.440> is<00:05:00.650> pretty<00:05:01.039> self-explanatory<00:05:01.370> which

00:05:02.050 --> 00:05:02.060 
lumens is pretty self-explanatory which

00:05:02.060 --> 00:05:04.689 
lumens is pretty self-explanatory which
is<00:05:02.210> what<00:05:02.419> the<00:05:02.570> 5-11<00:05:03.260> let<00:05:03.560> gives<00:05:03.830> you<00:05:03.949> now<00:05:04.669> I

00:05:04.689 --> 00:05:04.699 
is what the 5-11 let gives you now I

00:05:04.699 --> 00:05:07.180 
is what the 5-11 let gives you now I
have<00:05:04.880> been<00:05:05.780> carrying<00:05:06.169> this<00:05:06.320> is<00:05:06.530> the<00:05:06.680> the<00:05:07.010> wool

flies<00:05:07.430> angel<00:05:07.940> see<00:05:08.180> it's<00:05:09.139> what<00:05:09.320> I've<00:05:09.410> been<00:05:09.440> kind

00:05:10.210 --> 00:05:10.220 
flies angel see it's what I've been kind

flies angel see it's what I've been kind
of<00:05:10.280> transitioning<00:05:10.820> back<00:05:10.940> and<00:05:11.180> forth<00:05:11.419> between

00:05:11.680 --> 00:05:11.690 
of transitioning back and forth between

00:05:11.690 --> 00:05:13.629 
of transitioning back and forth between
in<00:05:12.410> all<00:05:12.620> the<00:05:12.710> different<00:05:13.039> lights<00:05:13.220> which<00:05:13.460> are

00:05:13.629 --> 00:05:13.639 
in all the different lights which are

00:05:13.639 --> 00:05:15.790 
in all the different lights which are
these<00:05:13.789> two<00:05:13.849> and<00:05:14.419> then<00:05:14.510> this<00:05:14.720> one<00:05:14.990> so<00:05:15.470> obviously

00:05:15.790 --> 00:05:15.800 
these two and then this one so obviously

00:05:15.800 --> 00:05:18.490 
these two and then this one so obviously
I<00:05:15.860> 200<00:05:16.430> lumens<00:05:16.820> you<00:05:17.720> know<00:05:17.840> it's<00:05:18.229> definitely

00:05:18.490 --> 00:05:18.500 
I 200 lumens you know it's definitely

00:05:18.500 --> 00:05:22.390 
I 200 lumens you know it's definitely
hard<00:05:18.979> to<00:05:19.130> match<00:05:19.340> but<00:05:20.740> what<00:05:21.740> I<00:05:21.770> do<00:05:21.889> like<00:05:22.160> about

00:05:22.390 --> 00:05:22.400 
hard to match but what I do like about

00:05:22.400 --> 00:05:25.060 
hard to match but what I do like about
the<00:05:22.849> 5-11<00:05:23.360> and<00:05:23.720> the<00:05:23.930> the<00:05:24.440> stream<00:05:24.680> lights<00:05:24.889> is

00:05:25.060 --> 00:05:25.070 
the 5-11 and the the stream lights is

00:05:25.070 --> 00:05:27.550 
the 5-11 and the the stream lights is
the<00:05:25.099> actual<00:05:25.610> size<00:05:25.820> because<00:05:26.270> this<00:05:26.389> is<00:05:26.539> a<00:05:26.570> cr123

00:05:27.550 --> 00:05:27.560 
the actual size because this is a cr123

00:05:27.560 --> 00:05:29.370 
the actual size because this is a cr123
battery<00:05:27.919> it<00:05:28.280> obviously<00:05:28.820> makes<00:05:29.060> the

00:05:29.370 --> 00:05:29.380 
battery it obviously makes the

00:05:29.380 --> 00:05:32.159 
battery it obviously makes the
flashlight<00:05:30.380> itself<00:05:30.770> be<00:05:31.070> a<00:05:31.099> little<00:05:31.550> bit<00:05:31.669> more

00:05:32.159 --> 00:05:32.169 
flashlight itself be a little bit more

00:05:32.169 --> 00:05:35.409 
flashlight itself be a little bit more
chunky<00:05:33.169> and<00:05:33.380> lack<00:05:33.919> of<00:05:34.039> a<00:05:34.130> better<00:05:34.220> word<00:05:34.460> so<00:05:35.120> this

00:05:35.409 --> 00:05:35.419 
chunky and lack of a better word so this

00:05:35.419 --> 00:05:37.120 
chunky and lack of a better word so this
one<00:05:35.599> since<00:05:35.870> it's<00:05:36.050> a<00:05:36.260> you<00:05:36.620> know<00:05:36.680> triple-a

00:05:37.120 --> 00:05:37.130 
one since it's a you know triple-a

00:05:37.130 --> 00:05:38.710 
one since it's a you know triple-a
battery<00:05:37.490> the<00:05:37.729> same<00:05:37.909> as<00:05:38.090> the<00:05:38.240> two<00:05:38.419> Stream

00:05:38.710 --> 00:05:38.720 
battery the same as the two Stream

00:05:38.720 --> 00:05:41.020 
battery the same as the two Stream
lights<00:05:38.930> it's<00:05:39.169> it<00:05:39.590> makes<00:05:39.830> it<00:05:39.949> more<00:05:40.099> streamlined

00:05:41.020 --> 00:05:41.030 
lights it's it makes it more streamlined

00:05:41.030 --> 00:05:42.960 
lights it's it makes it more streamlined
so<00:05:41.750> it's<00:05:41.870> easier<00:05:42.139> to<00:05:42.169> fit<00:05:42.409> into<00:05:42.530> a<00:05:42.650> pocket

00:05:42.960 --> 00:05:42.970 
so it's easier to fit into a pocket

00:05:42.970 --> 00:05:44.950 
so it's easier to fit into a pocket
especially<00:05:43.970> if<00:05:44.389> you're<00:05:44.479> gonna<00:05:44.570> be<00:05:44.720> carrying

especially if you're gonna be carrying
