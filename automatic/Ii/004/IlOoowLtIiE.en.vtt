own<00:02:21.460> toys<00:02:21.760> I<00:02:22.120> decided<00:02:22.810> to<00:02:23.110> come<00:02:23.650> up<00:02:23.680> with

00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:23.890

00:02:23.890 --> 00:02:26.370 
own toys I decided to come up with
something<00:02:24.280> and<00:02:24.430> fix<00:02:24.700> her<00:02:24.850> garden<00:02:25.240> and<00:02:25.480> lo<00:02:26.260> and

something and fix her garden and lo and

00:02:26.380 --> 00:02:29.340 
something and fix her garden and lo and
behold<00:02:26.500> I<00:02:26.890> did<00:02:27.100> and<00:02:27.400> then<00:02:27.700> my<00:02:28.690> friends<00:02:29.080> wanted

00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:29.350 
behold I did and then my friends wanted

00:02:29.350 --> 00:02:30.840 
behold I did and then my friends wanted
to<00:02:29.410> try<00:02:29.620> it<00:02:29.680> out<00:02:29.860> and<00:02:30.070> that<00:02:30.220> worked<00:02:30.550> and<00:02:30.730> then

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:30.850 
to try it out and that worked and then

00:02:30.850 --> 00:02:32.820 
to try it out and that worked and then
the<00:02:31.000> light<00:02:31.180> popped<00:02:31.510> in<00:02:31.690> my<00:02:31.810> head<00:02:31.840> and<00:02:32.230> I<00:02:32.290> said<00:02:32.590> I

00:02:32.820 --> 00:02:32.830 
the light popped in my head and I said I

00:02:32.830 --> 00:02:35.550 
the light popped in my head and I said I
could<00:02:33.459> probably<00:02:33.580> sell<00:02:33.970> this<00:02:34.320> anywhere<00:02:35.320> and

00:02:35.550 --> 00:02:35.560 
could probably sell this anywhere and

00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:37.199 
could probably sell this anywhere and
then<00:02:35.770> it<00:02:35.890> just<00:02:36.010> went<00:02:36.220> from<00:02:36.340> there<00:02:36.550> so<00:02:36.880> that's

00:02:37.199 --> 00:02:37.209 
then it just went from there so that's

00:02:37.209 --> 00:02:39.570 
then it just went from there so that's
where<00:02:37.870> it<00:02:37.930> started<00:02:38.290> is<00:02:38.470> just<00:02:38.500> with<00:02:39.160> an<00:02:39.280> idea

00:02:39.570 --> 00:02:39.580 
where it started is just with an idea

00:02:39.580 --> 00:02:42.240 
where it started is just with an idea
and<00:02:40.260> with<00:02:41.260> with<00:02:41.650> the<00:02:41.740> drive<00:02:41.980> and<00:02:42.160> ambition

00:02:42.240 --> 00:02:42.250 
and with with the drive and ambition

00:02:42.250 --> 00:02:46.170 
and with with the drive and ambition
that<00:02:42.610> I<00:02:42.730> carry<00:02:43.090> in<00:02:43.240> my<00:02:43.300> life<00:02:43.570> in<00:02:43.810> my<00:02:43.959> heart
