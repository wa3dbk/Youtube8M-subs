00:01:01.849 --> 00:01:01.859 
thing with this game is that you don't

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:04.570 
thing with this game is that you don't
actually<00:01:02.070> walk<00:01:02.460> around<00:01:02.640> these<00:01:03.600> stand<00:01:04.080> still

00:01:04.570 --> 00:01:04.580 
actually walk around these stand still

00:01:04.580 --> 00:01:07.190 
actually walk around these stand still
which<00:01:05.580> could<00:01:05.820> be<00:01:05.970> a<00:01:06.000> little<00:01:06.180> bit<00:01:06.330> random<00:01:06.540> when

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:07.200 
which could be a little bit random when

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:09.130 
which could be a little bit random when
you<00:01:07.290> have<00:01:07.409> a<00:01:07.500> good<00:01:07.650> smartphone<00:01:08.159> like<00:01:08.280> a<00:01:08.430> ps4

00:01:09.130 --> 00:01:09.140 
you have a good smartphone like a ps4

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:14.109 
you have a good smartphone like a ps4
and<00:01:10.140> it<00:01:10.320> could<00:01:10.590> be<00:01:10.740> a<00:01:10.770> very<00:01:11.250> very<00:01:11.520> random<00:01:12.000> here

00:01:14.109 --> 00:01:14.119 
and it could be a very very random here

00:01:14.119 --> 00:01:17.600 
and it could be a very very random here
because<00:01:15.119> you<00:01:15.330> want<00:01:15.570> to<00:01:15.600> walk<00:01:15.810> around<00:01:16.430> but<00:01:17.430> this

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:17.610 
because you want to walk around but this

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:19.880 
because you want to walk around but this
is<00:01:17.729> good<00:01:17.880> also<00:01:18.060> for<00:01:18.210> because<00:01:19.049> the<00:01:19.380> then<00:01:19.680> this

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:19.890 
is good also for because the then this

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:21.679 
is good also for because the then this
game<00:01:20.070> would<00:01:20.310> work<00:01:20.580> probably<00:01:21.000> good<00:01:21.150> on<00:01:21.330> all

00:01:21.679 --> 00:01:21.689 
game would work probably good on all

00:01:21.689 --> 00:01:27.109 
game would work probably good on all
Moscow<00:01:25.040> they're<00:01:26.040> not<00:01:26.159> gonna<00:01:26.340> live<00:01:26.610> it's<00:01:27.030> a

00:03:47.720 --> 00:03:47.730 

00:03:47.730 --> 00:03:49.890 

pretty<00:03:48.730> using<00:03:49.000> the<00:03:49.090> back<00:03:49.239> in<00:03:49.480> in<00:03:49.810> the

00:03:49.890 --> 00:03:49.900 
pretty using the back in in the

00:03:49.900 --> 00:03:51.780 
pretty using the back in in the
beginnings<00:03:50.290> I<00:03:50.620> can<00:03:50.890> only<00:03:51.040> assume<00:03:51.370> that<00:03:51.489> it

00:03:51.780 --> 00:03:51.790 
beginnings I can only assume that it

00:03:51.790 --> 00:04:00.170 
beginnings I can only assume that it
will<00:03:52.030> be<00:03:52.180> horror

00:04:00.170 --> 00:04:00.180 

00:04:00.180 --> 00:04:03.000 

difficulty<00:04:01.180> this<00:04:02.140> one<00:04:02.350> could<00:04:02.560> be<00:04:02.590> a<00:04:02.770> little

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:03.010 
difficulty this one could be a little

00:04:03.010 --> 00:04:07.920 
difficulty this one could be a little
bit<00:04:03.130> harder<00:04:06.060> okay<00:04:07.060> so<00:04:07.150> you<00:04:07.300> can't<00:04:07.480> like<00:04:07.750> you

00:04:07.920 --> 00:04:07.930 
bit harder okay so you can't like you

00:04:07.930 --> 00:04:10.170 
bit harder okay so you can't like you
take<00:04:08.140> a<00:04:08.290> special<00:04:08.770> special<00:04:09.550> thick<00:04:09.940> feature

00:04:10.170 --> 00:04:10.180 
take a special special thick feature

00:04:10.180 --> 00:04:12.650 
take a special special thick feature
here<00:04:10.540> probably<00:04:11.050> 50%<00:04:11.530> power<00:04:11.950> up
