00:00:07.810 --> 00:00:07.820 
address a question that I got regarding

00:00:07.820 --> 00:00:12.919 
address a question that I got regarding
modeling<00:00:08.820> to<00:00:09.150> exact<00:00:09.750> measurement<00:00:11.929> sometimes

00:00:12.919 --> 00:00:12.929 
modeling to exact measurement sometimes

00:00:12.929 --> 00:00:15.049 
modeling to exact measurement sometimes
you<00:00:13.170> want<00:00:13.349> to<00:00:13.500> model<00:00:13.799> something<00:00:14.160> based<00:00:14.490> on<00:00:14.700> for

00:00:15.049 --> 00:00:15.059 
you want to model something based on for

00:00:15.059 --> 00:00:16.580 
you want to model something based on for
example<00:00:15.089> a<00:00:15.480> blueprint<00:00:15.870> or<00:00:16.109> you're<00:00:16.470> having

00:00:16.580 --> 00:00:16.590 
example a blueprint or you're having

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:19.429 
example a blueprint or you're having
trouble<00:00:17.220> getting<00:00:17.250> the<00:00:17.970> exact<00:00:18.449> ratios<00:00:19.080> right

00:00:19.429 --> 00:00:19.439 
trouble getting the exact ratios right

00:00:19.439 --> 00:00:21.590 
trouble getting the exact ratios right
and<00:00:19.710> you<00:00:20.220> want<00:00:20.369> to<00:00:20.460> follow<00:00:20.640> measurements<00:00:21.480> that

00:00:21.590 --> 00:00:21.600 
and you want to follow measurements that

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:23.330 
and you want to follow measurements that
you<00:00:21.630> got<00:00:21.900> on<00:00:22.109> some<00:00:22.769> paper<00:00:22.949> something<00:00:23.189> like

00:00:23.330 --> 00:00:23.340 
you got on some paper something like

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:26.380 
you got on some paper something like
that<00:00:23.550> so<00:00:24.510> that<00:00:24.869> you<00:00:25.109> can<00:00:25.260> do<00:00:25.350> that<00:00:25.529> in<00:00:25.680> Maya

00:00:26.380 --> 00:00:26.390 
that so that you can do that in Maya

00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:29.000 
that so that you can do that in Maya
first<00:00:27.390> of<00:00:27.510> all<00:00:27.689> before<00:00:28.019> I<00:00:28.230> show<00:00:28.529> you<00:00:28.560> how<00:00:28.680> to<00:00:28.800> do

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:29.010 
first of all before I show you how to do

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:31.460 
first of all before I show you how to do
that<00:00:29.189> we<00:00:29.490> need<00:00:29.640> to<00:00:29.820> figure<00:00:30.150> out<00:00:30.420> what<00:00:31.260> the

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:31.470 
that we need to figure out what the

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:33.380 
that we need to figure out what the
setting<00:00:31.830> is<00:00:32.130> in<00:00:32.520> Maya<00:00:32.790> right<00:00:33.030> now

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:33.390 
setting is in Maya right now

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:35.810 
setting is in Maya right now
so<00:00:33.899> is<00:00:34.170> it<00:00:34.350> measuring<00:00:34.800> in<00:00:34.980> inches<00:00:35.160> or<00:00:35.730> in

00:00:35.810 --> 00:00:35.820 
so is it measuring in inches or in

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:37.670 
so is it measuring in inches or in
centimeters<00:00:36.300> so<00:00:36.510> that's<00:00:37.230> we're<00:00:37.500> going<00:00:37.590> to

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:37.680 
centimeters so that's we're going to

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:39.110 
centimeters so that's we're going to
check<00:00:37.829> first<00:00:38.129> we're<00:00:38.520> going<00:00:38.610> to<00:00:38.670> go<00:00:38.820> up<00:00:38.940> to

00:00:59.209 --> 00:00:59.219 
on centimeters right now okay I'm just

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:01.970 
on centimeters right now okay I'm just
going<00:00:59.399> to<00:00:59.430> close<00:00:59.579> that<00:00:59.870> now<00:01:00.870> let's<00:01:01.350> say<00:01:01.559> I<00:01:01.620> got

00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:01.980 
going to close that now let's say I got

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:04.399 
going to close that now let's say I got
two<00:01:02.250> objects<00:01:02.760> and<00:01:02.910> I<00:01:03.000> want<00:01:03.270> to<00:01:03.449> measure<00:01:03.930> the

00:01:04.399 --> 00:01:04.409 
two objects and I want to measure the

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:06.410 
two objects and I want to measure the
exact<00:01:04.739> distance<00:01:04.830> between<00:01:05.220> the<00:01:05.519> two<00:01:05.729> so<00:01:06.210> I'll

00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:06.420 
exact distance between the two so I'll

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:09.620 
exact distance between the two so I'll
just<00:01:06.630> quickly<00:01:07.200> set<00:01:08.159> up<00:01:08.189> two<00:01:08.549> objects<00:01:09.030> got<00:01:09.600> a

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:09.630 
just quickly set up two objects got a

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:13.780 
just quickly set up two objects got a
cube<00:01:09.990> here<00:01:10.409> and<00:01:10.909> I<00:01:11.909> got<00:01:12.090> a<00:01:12.119> cube<00:01:12.540> over<00:01:12.780> there

00:01:13.780 --> 00:01:13.790 
cube here and I got a cube over there

00:01:13.790 --> 00:01:18.320 
cube here and I got a cube over there
okay<00:01:14.790> at<00:01:15.659> 5-4<00:01:16.259> shaded<00:01:16.530> mode<00:01:16.880> okay<00:01:17.880> so<00:01:17.939> let's

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:18.330 
okay at 5-4 shaded mode okay so let's

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:20.780 
okay at 5-4 shaded mode okay so let's
say<00:01:18.600> I<00:01:18.659> want<00:01:18.960> to<00:01:19.020> know<00:01:19.140> the<00:01:19.770> exact<00:01:20.220> measurement

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:20.790 
say I want to know the exact measurement

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:23.960 
say I want to know the exact measurement
between<00:01:21.540> these<00:01:21.810> two<00:01:22.170> cubes<00:01:22.740> here<00:01:23.009> what<00:01:23.820> I<00:01:23.850> do

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:23.970 
between these two cubes here what I do

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:28.999 
between these two cubes here what I do
is<00:01:24.479> I<00:01:24.840> go<00:01:25.110> up<00:01:25.229> to<00:01:26.330> create<00:01:27.330> go<00:01:28.259> down<00:01:28.439> to<00:01:28.680> measure

00:01:28.999 --> 00:01:29.009 
is I go up to create go down to measure
