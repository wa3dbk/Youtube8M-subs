00:01:59.160 --> 00:01:59.170 
and whatever it was all through the same

00:01:59.170 --> 00:02:02.430 
and whatever it was all through the same
same<00:02:00.070> channel<00:02:00.460> of<00:02:00.610> the<00:02:00.760> duet<00:02:01.090> and<00:02:01.570> then<00:02:01.720> vocals

the<00:02:27.910> duet<00:02:28.330> is<00:02:28.620> certainly<00:02:29.790> capable<00:02:30.790> of<00:02:31.240> more

00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:32.200 
the duet is certainly capable of more

00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:33.990 
the duet is certainly capable of more
than<00:02:32.410> just<00:02:32.470> demoing<00:02:33.160> I<00:02:33.430> mean<00:02:33.580> you'll<00:02:33.730> hear

00:02:33.990 --> 00:02:34.000
