00:00:48.459 --> 00:00:48.469 
like little broccolis that don't look

00:00:48.469 --> 00:00:51.490 
like little broccolis that don't look
like<00:00:48.530> broccoli<00:00:49.100> that<00:00:49.670> didn't<00:00:50.539> make<00:00:50.690> any<00:00:50.839> sense

00:00:51.490 --> 00:00:51.500 
like broccoli that didn't make any sense

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:53.859 
like broccoli that didn't make any sense
but<00:00:51.859> I<00:00:51.890> really<00:00:52.399> enjoy<00:00:52.729> drawing<00:00:53.089> a<00:00:53.390> little

00:00:53.859 --> 00:00:53.869 
but I really enjoy drawing a little

00:00:53.869 --> 00:00:56.500 
but I really enjoy drawing a little
mushrooms<00:00:54.199> in<00:00:54.350> class<00:00:54.619> and<00:00:55.129> from<00:00:55.909> there<00:00:56.210> I

00:00:56.500 --> 00:00:56.510 
mushrooms in class and from there I

00:00:56.510 --> 00:00:58.569 
mushrooms in class and from there I
started<00:00:57.109> drawing<00:00:57.350> some<00:00:57.739> Alice<00:00:58.070> in<00:00:58.190> Wonderland

00:00:58.569 --> 00:00:58.579 
started drawing some Alice in Wonderland

00:00:58.579 --> 00:01:02.829 
started drawing some Alice in Wonderland
fan<00:00:58.850> art<00:00:59.059> and<00:00:59.210> I<00:01:00.699> guess<00:01:01.699> I<00:01:01.969> really<00:01:02.510> wanted<00:01:02.780> to

00:01:02.829 --> 00:01:02.839 
fan art and I guess I really wanted to

00:01:02.839 --> 00:01:06.520 
fan art and I guess I really wanted to
do<00:01:03.309> the<00:01:04.309> drawing<00:01:04.640> more<00:01:04.970> on<00:01:05.210> the<00:01:05.360> lines<00:01:05.869> of<00:01:06.200> the

00:01:06.520 --> 00:01:06.530 
do the drawing more on the lines of the

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:09.039 
do the drawing more on the lines of the
actual<00:01:06.890> manga<00:01:07.310> and<00:01:07.520> the<00:01:08.060> manga<00:01:08.420> itself<00:01:08.869> it's

00:01:09.039 --> 00:01:09.049 
actual manga and the manga itself it's

00:01:09.049 --> 00:01:10.380 
actual manga and the manga itself it's
called<00:01:09.229> are<00:01:09.439> you<00:01:09.470> Alice

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:10.390 
called are you Alice

00:01:10.390 --> 00:01:14.919 
called are you Alice
I'll<00:01:11.390> further<00:01:11.750> explain<00:01:12.170> that<00:01:12.350> in<00:01:12.710> a<00:01:12.740> sec<00:01:13.929> so

00:01:14.919 --> 00:01:14.929 
I'll further explain that in a sec so

00:01:14.929 --> 00:01:17.320 
I'll further explain that in a sec so
with<00:01:15.440> this<00:01:15.590> drawing<00:01:15.890> I<00:01:16.340> didn't<00:01:17.000> have<00:01:17.090> many

00:01:17.320 --> 00:01:17.330 
with this drawing I didn't have many

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:19.480 
with this drawing I didn't have many
colors<00:01:17.720> to<00:01:17.750> work<00:01:18.170> with<00:01:18.229> because<00:01:18.770> when<00:01:19.399> you

00:01:19.480 --> 00:01:19.490 
colors to work with because when you

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:20.620 
colors to work with because when you
think<00:01:19.640> about<00:01:19.759> what's<00:01:20.090> a<00:01:20.119> Wonderland<00:01:20.539> you

00:01:20.620 --> 00:01:20.630 
think about what's a Wonderland you

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:23.859 
think about what's a Wonderland you
think<00:01:20.840> of<00:01:20.960> a<00:01:21.020> lot<00:01:21.289> of<00:01:21.490> colors<00:01:22.490> weird<00:01:23.420> colors

00:01:23.859 --> 00:01:23.869 
think of a lot of colors weird colors

00:01:23.869 --> 00:01:27.370 
think of a lot of colors weird colors
are<00:01:24.470> colors<00:01:24.920> light<00:01:25.490> colors<00:01:25.970> and<00:01:26.390> I<00:01:27.110> couldn't

00:01:27.370 --> 00:01:27.380 
are colors light colors and I couldn't

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:29.020 
are colors light colors and I couldn't
really<00:01:27.500> play<00:01:27.709> around<00:01:27.920> with<00:01:28.069> it<00:01:28.280> as<00:01:28.459> much<00:01:28.520> as<00:01:28.940> I

00:01:29.020 --> 00:01:29.030 
really play around with it as much as I

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:32.260 
really play around with it as much as I
really<00:01:29.270> wanted<00:01:29.299> to<00:01:29.810> so<00:01:30.560> I<00:01:31.009> guess<00:01:31.759> if<00:01:31.909> I<00:01:31.970> had<00:01:32.000> my

00:01:32.260 --> 00:01:32.270 
really wanted to so I guess if I had my

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:34.090 
really wanted to so I guess if I had my
color<00:01:32.509> pencils<00:01:32.990> this<00:01:33.200> would<00:01:33.409> have<00:01:33.500> been<00:01:33.590> way

00:01:34.090 --> 00:01:34.100 
color pencils this would have been way

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:36.940 
color pencils this would have been way
easier<00:01:34.130> than<00:01:34.700> just<00:01:35.240> using<00:01:35.360> marker<00:01:35.990> but<00:01:36.619> at<00:01:36.770> the

00:01:36.940 --> 00:01:36.950 
easier than just using marker but at the

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:38.889 
easier than just using marker but at the
time<00:01:37.159> I<00:01:37.459> just<00:01:37.490> really<00:01:38.000> wanted<00:01:38.240> to<00:01:38.330> use<00:01:38.479> marker

00:01:38.889 --> 00:01:38.899 
time I just really wanted to use marker

00:01:38.899 --> 00:01:43.149 
time I just really wanted to use marker
and<00:01:39.560> I<00:01:40.569> really<00:01:41.569> liked<00:01:41.719> the<00:01:41.840> drawing<00:01:42.049> I<00:01:42.439> wish<00:01:43.009> I

00:01:43.149 --> 00:01:43.159 
and I really liked the drawing I wish I

00:01:43.159 --> 00:01:45.940 
and I really liked the drawing I wish I
could<00:01:43.820> have<00:01:43.909> done<00:01:44.030> more<00:01:44.270> with<00:01:44.329> it<00:01:44.780> honestly<00:01:45.289> so

00:01:45.940 --> 00:01:45.950 
could have done more with it honestly so

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:48.920 
could have done more with it honestly so
maybe<00:01:46.789> later<00:01:47.270> in<00:01:47.840> the<00:01:48.200> year

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:48.930 
maybe later in the year

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:53.300 
maybe later in the year
I'll<00:01:49.170> probably<00:01:49.890> redraw<00:01:50.610> this<00:01:50.850> because<00:01:52.310> you

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:53.310 
I'll probably redraw this because you

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:56.450 
I'll probably redraw this because you
know<00:01:53.430> no<00:01:54.150> Waco<00:01:54.510> came<00:01:54.780> out<00:01:54.990> but<00:01:55.680> I'm<00:01:55.980> like<00:01:56.160> I<00:01:56.190> can

00:01:56.450 --> 00:01:56.460 
know no Waco came out but I'm like I can

00:01:56.460 --> 00:01:58.850 
know no Waco came out but I'm like I can

and he has to deal with various
obstacles<00:03:03.220> but<00:03:04.120> because<00:03:04.450> he's<00:03:04.660> so<00:03:04.810> different

00:03:05.220 --> 00:03:05.230 
obstacles but because he's so different

00:03:05.230 --> 00:03:06.960 
obstacles but because he's so different
from<00:03:05.290> other<00:03:05.470> Alice's<00:03:06.070> he<00:03:06.220> did<00:03:06.370> not<00:03:06.490> fall<00:03:06.760> down

00:03:06.960 --> 00:03:06.970 
from other Alice's he did not fall down

00:03:06.970 --> 00:03:08.880 
from other Alice's he did not fall down
a<00:03:07.000> hole<00:03:07.060> he<00:03:07.510> was<00:03:07.630> already<00:03:07.990> there<00:03:08.320> but<00:03:08.620> he<00:03:08.770> was

00:03:08.880 --> 00:03:08.890 
a hole he was already there but he was

00:03:08.890 --> 00:03:11.550 
a hole he was already there but he was
not<00:03:09.070> born<00:03:09.310> I<00:03:09.660> really<00:03:10.660> think<00:03:10.930> that<00:03:11.050> the<00:03:11.290> story

00:03:11.550 --> 00:03:11.560 
not born I really think that the story

00:03:11.560 --> 00:03:15.199 
not born I really think that the story
is<00:03:11.650> gonna<00:03:11.770> take<00:03:12.040> a<00:03:12.450> really<00:03:13.450> big<00:03:13.480> turn<00:03:13.930> and

00:03:15.199 --> 00:03:15.209 
is gonna take a really big turn and

00:03:15.209 --> 00:03:18.390 
is gonna take a really big turn and
changed<00:03:16.209> the<00:03:16.330> way<00:03:16.480> each<00:03:16.990> character<00:03:17.620> things

00:03:18.390 --> 00:03:18.400 
changed the way each character things

00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:20.310 
changed the way each character things
and<00:03:18.730> the<00:03:19.030> way<00:03:19.180> each<00:03:19.209> character<00:03:19.780> is<00:03:19.870> function

00:03:20.310 --> 00:03:20.320 
and the way each character is function

00:03:20.320 --> 00:03:22.140 
and the way each character is function
because<00:03:20.590> you<00:03:20.620> know<00:03:20.860> they<00:03:21.519> have<00:03:21.730> to<00:03:21.850> obey<00:03:22.090> the

00:03:22.140 --> 00:03:22.150 
because you know they have to obey the

00:03:22.150 --> 00:03:24.840 
because you know they have to obey the
Queen<00:03:22.450> and<00:03:22.810> I<00:03:23.709> don't<00:03:24.040> even<00:03:24.130> think<00:03:24.400> though<00:03:24.580> the

00:03:24.840 --> 00:03:24.850 
Queen and I don't even think though the

00:03:24.850 --> 00:03:26.610 
Queen and I don't even think though the
Queen<00:03:25.090> will<00:03:25.239> obey<00:03:25.660> her<00:03:25.870> own<00:03:26.019> rules<00:03:26.320> or<00:03:26.590> the

00:03:26.610 --> 00:03:26.620 
Queen will obey her own rules or the

00:03:26.620 --> 00:03:29.070 
Queen will obey her own rules or the
rules<00:03:27.040> of<00:03:27.160> Wonderland<00:03:27.519> so<00:03:28.330> from<00:03:28.600> there<00:03:28.810> I'm

00:03:29.070 --> 00:03:29.080
