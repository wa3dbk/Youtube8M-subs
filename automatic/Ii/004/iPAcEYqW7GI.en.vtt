00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:35.220
 indication that is this value 

00:01:32.010 --> 00:01:36.930
 serves to cut off

 also accordingly change where 

00:03:47.930 --> 00:03:53.800
 assignment of discrimination to display

 only through ferrous metals 

00:03:54.090 --> 00:04:03.750
 bring the non-ferrous metal device in no way 

00:03:58.299 --> 00:04:03.750
 reacts bring the black metal 

00:04:08.190 --> 00:04:14.190
 we substitute the value of discrimination on

00:04:22.410 --> 00:04:31.720
 we throw a non-ferrous metal this mode 

00:04:26.410 --> 00:04:34.740
 there is no detuning from the instrument

00:04:34.790 --> 00:04:41.180
 In this mode, use manual

 adjustment of the device for large objects 

00:04:41.180 --> 00:04:46.490
 let's say we take a black object 

00:04:47.840 --> 00:04:53.330
 let the black object we will serve
