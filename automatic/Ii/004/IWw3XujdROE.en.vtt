can see on your screen right now I've
got<00:02:06.860> my<00:02:06.890> airframe<00:02:07.729> helmet<00:02:08.060> here<00:02:08.360> my<00:02:08.630> comm<00:02:08.840> type

00:02:09.039 --> 00:02:09.049 
got my airframe helmet here my comm type

00:02:09.049 --> 00:02:10.630 
got my airframe helmet here my comm type
2<00:02:09.200> headsets<00:02:09.560> and<00:02:09.679> the<00:02:09.860> adapters<00:02:10.280> right<00:02:10.310> here

00:02:10.630 --> 00:02:10.640 
2 headsets and the adapters right here

00:02:10.640 --> 00:02:13.000 
2 headsets and the adapters right here
so<00:02:11.390> pretty<00:02:11.690> much<00:02:11.840> when<00:02:12.230> you<00:02:12.320> get<00:02:12.410> your<00:02:12.560> headset

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:13.010 
so pretty much when you get your headset

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:15.069 
so pretty much when you get your headset
itself<00:02:13.549> it<00:02:13.790> just<00:02:14.000> comes<00:02:14.239> like<00:02:14.510> this<00:02:14.780> it's<00:02:14.959> not

00:02:15.069 --> 00:02:15.079 
itself it just comes like this it's not

00:02:15.079 --> 00:02:16.870 
itself it just comes like this it's not
actually<00:02:15.380> balled<00:02:15.590> up<00:02:15.709> like<00:02:15.799> this<00:02:16.070> but<00:02:16.340> I<00:02:16.549> have

00:02:16.870 --> 00:02:16.880 
actually balled up like this but I have

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:19.420 
actually balled up like this but I have
it<00:02:17.180> like<00:02:17.329> this<00:02:17.390> just<00:02:17.720> for<00:02:17.780> storage<00:02:18.079> but<00:02:19.010> pretty

00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:19.430 
it like this just for storage but pretty

00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:21.550

let's go ahead I'm going to zoom out a

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:28.090 
let's go ahead I'm going to zoom out a
little<00:02:26.120> bit<00:02:26.329> and<00:02:26.600> let's<00:02:27.079> go<00:02:27.230> ahead<00:02:27.350> and<00:02:27.709> start

themselves<00:03:44.680> and<00:03:45.190> actually<00:03:45.490> my<00:03:45.610> wire<00:03:45.820> from<00:03:46.090> my

00:03:46.260 --> 00:03:46.270 
themselves and actually my wire from my

00:03:46.270 --> 00:03:48.960 
themselves and actually my wire from my
mic<00:03:46.480> just<00:03:46.690> broke<00:03:47.290> and<00:03:47.860> the<00:03:48.400> process<00:03:48.850> of

00:03:48.960 --> 00:03:48.970 
mic just broke and the process of

00:04:03.240 --> 00:04:03.250 
them up so you just make sure it's

00:04:03.250 --> 00:04:06.270 
them up so you just make sure it's
pushed<00:04:03.580> out<00:04:03.820> and<00:04:04.750> you<00:04:04.840> just<00:04:04.900> slide<00:04:05.290> it<00:04:05.470> on<00:04:05.560> like

00:04:06.270 --> 00:04:06.280 
pushed out and you just slide it on like

00:04:06.280 --> 00:04:14.130 
pushed out and you just slide it on like
this<00:04:11.670> there's<00:04:12.670> one<00:04:12.790> let's<00:04:13.570> get<00:04:13.690> the<00:04:13.810> other<00:04:13.960> one

00:04:16.710 --> 00:04:16.720 
on there now you can do a little bit of

00:04:16.720 --> 00:04:18.240

00:04:54.150 --> 00:04:54.160 
one problem that I ran into with this

00:04:54.160 --> 00:04:57.300 
one problem that I ran into with this
going<00:04:54.550> on<00:04:54.669> was<00:04:55.590> actually<00:04:56.590> when<00:04:56.950> I<00:04:56.980> put<00:04:57.220> the

00:04:57.300 --> 00:04:57.310 
going on was actually when I put the

00:04:57.310 --> 00:04:58.980 
going on was actually when I put the
helmet<00:04:57.430> on<00:04:57.610> with<00:04:57.790> these<00:04:57.940> on<00:04:58.150> these<00:04:58.419> actually

00:04:58.980 --> 00:04:58.990 
helmet on with these on these actually

00:04:58.990 --> 00:05:01.230 
helmet on with these on these actually
tend<00:04:59.590> to<00:04:59.770> bulge<00:05:00.430> out<00:05:00.610> a<00:05:00.669> little<00:05:00.820> bit<00:05:00.970> and<00:05:01.120> they

00:05:01.230 --> 00:05:01.240 
tend to bulge out a little bit and they

00:05:01.240 --> 00:05:03.150 
tend to bulge out a little bit and they
actually<00:05:01.600> like<00:05:01.750> break<00:05:02.050> off<00:05:02.290> it<00:05:02.710> doesn't<00:05:02.860> break

00:05:03.150 --> 00:05:03.160 
actually like break off it doesn't break

00:05:03.160 --> 00:05:05.720 
actually like break off it doesn't break
them<00:05:03.430> out<00:05:03.520> necessarily<00:05:04.210> but<00:05:04.390> it<00:05:04.540> just<00:05:04.750> the

00:05:05.720 --> 00:05:05.730 
them out necessarily but it just the

00:05:05.730 --> 00:05:08.190 
them out necessarily but it just the
headset<00:05:06.730> comes<00:05:07.030> off<00:05:07.270> with<00:05:07.510> that<00:05:07.630> so<00:05:07.930> I'm<00:05:08.110> going

00:05:08.190 --> 00:05:08.200 
headset comes off with that so I'm going

00:05:08.200 --> 00:05:09.420 
headset comes off with that so I'm going
to<00:05:08.290> try<00:05:08.410> to<00:05:08.440> figure<00:05:08.710> out<00:05:08.800> a<00:05:08.860> way<00:05:08.890> to<00:05:08.980> get<00:05:09.160> it<00:05:09.310> to

00:05:09.420 --> 00:05:09.430 
to try to figure out a way to get it to

00:05:09.430 --> 00:05:11.790 
to try to figure out a way to get it to
work<00:05:09.610> with<00:05:10.180> that<00:05:10.360> on<00:05:10.540> maybe<00:05:11.290> just<00:05:11.500> putting<00:05:11.710> it

00:05:11.790 --> 00:05:11.800 
work with that on maybe just putting it

00:05:11.800 --> 00:05:13.590 
work with that on maybe just putting it
on<00:05:11.830> a<00:05:11.890> little<00:05:12.010> bit<00:05:12.130> more<00:05:12.340> careful<00:05:12.970> but<00:05:13.300> other

00:05:13.590 --> 00:05:13.600 
on a little bit more careful but other

00:05:13.600 --> 00:05:15.360 
on a little bit more careful but other
than<00:05:13.750> that<00:05:13.840> it<00:05:14.230> works<00:05:14.440> up<00:05:14.710> they<00:05:15.070> work<00:05:15.190> pretty

00:05:15.360 --> 00:05:15.370 
than that it works up they work pretty

00:05:15.370 --> 00:05:17.880 
than that it works up they work pretty
well<00:05:15.510> so<00:05:16.510> let's<00:05:16.660> go<00:05:16.720> ahead<00:05:16.870> and<00:05:17.020> just<00:05:17.169> just
