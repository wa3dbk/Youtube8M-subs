and like kind of washed out which I

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:34.880 
and like kind of washed out which I

00:00:57.350 --> 00:00:57.360 
unlike me I ruined a picture today

00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:00.049 
unlike me I ruined a picture today
because<00:00:57.780> I<00:00:57.809> tried<00:00:57.989> using<00:00:58.140> watercolor<00:00:59.059> diving

00:01:00.049 --> 00:01:00.059 
because I tried using watercolor diving

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:01.130 
because I tried using watercolor diving
straight<00:01:00.239> into<00:01:00.359> it<00:01:00.719> without<00:01:00.840> really

00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:01.140 
straight into it without really

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:03.590 
straight into it without really
practicing<00:01:01.680> I<00:01:01.859> just<00:01:02.010> fucked<00:01:02.219> it<00:01:02.340> up<00:01:02.460> I<00:01:02.730> fig

00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:03.600 
practicing I just fucked it up I fig

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:06.080 
practicing I just fucked it up I fig
tracing<00:01:04.019> paper<00:01:04.170> go<00:01:04.619> over<00:01:04.860> it<00:01:04.949> again<00:01:05.010> and<00:01:05.400> just

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:06.090 
tracing paper go over it again and just

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:09.289 
tracing paper go over it again and just
like<00:01:06.890> I'm<00:01:07.890> problem<00:01:08.250> I'm<00:01:08.490> probably<00:01:08.970> just<00:01:09.119> going

00:01:09.289 --> 00:01:09.299 
like I'm problem I'm probably just going

00:01:09.299 --> 00:01:14.060 
like I'm problem I'm probably just going
to<00:01:09.390> use<00:01:09.540> on<00:01:10.340> an<00:01:11.340> ink<00:01:12.140> to<00:01:13.140> do<00:01:13.290> it<00:01:13.409> this<00:01:13.530> time<00:01:13.590> and

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:14.070 
to use on an ink to do it this time and

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:16.940 
to use on an ink to do it this time and
maybe<00:01:14.369> colored<00:01:14.729> pencil<00:01:15.259> and<00:01:16.259> it's<00:01:16.770> such<00:01:16.920> a

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:16.950 
maybe colored pencil and it's such a

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:18.740 
maybe colored pencil and it's such a
shame<00:01:17.220> too<00:01:17.490> because<00:01:17.520> with<00:01:17.909> watercolor<00:01:18.450> you

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:18.750 
shame too because with watercolor you

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:21.499 
shame too because with watercolor you
can<00:01:18.869> really<00:01:19.110> get<00:01:19.259> a<00:01:19.290> nice<00:01:19.530> even<00:01:19.740> color<00:01:20.509> but

00:01:21.499 --> 00:01:21.509 
can really get a nice even color but

00:01:21.509 --> 00:01:23.090 
can really get a nice even color but
it's<00:01:21.689> hard<00:01:22.020> to<00:01:22.259> have<00:01:22.409> like<00:01:22.770> a<00:01:22.799> setback

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:23.100 
it's hard to have like a setback

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:27.819 
it's hard to have like a setback
radiation<00:01:23.790> of<00:01:23.939> tone<00:01:24.210> with<00:01:24.780> watercolor<00:01:25.350> and

00:01:27.819 --> 00:01:27.829 

00:01:27.829 --> 00:01:30.200 

partly<00:01:28.829> because<00:01:28.950> watercolor<00:01:29.549> is<00:01:29.670> more<00:01:29.909> of<00:01:30.090> an

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:30.210 
partly because watercolor is more of an

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:35.310 
partly because watercolor is more of an
abstracted<00:01:30.869> form<00:01:31.430> type<00:01:32.430> of

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:35.320 

00:01:35.320 --> 00:01:40.060 

material<00:01:36.320> and<00:01:38.200> you<00:01:39.200> can't<00:01:39.439> really<00:01:39.679> get<00:01:39.859> too

00:01:40.060 --> 00:01:40.070 
material and you can't really get too

00:01:40.070 --> 00:01:42.340 
material and you can't really get too
much<00:01:40.250> detail<00:01:40.759> unless<00:01:41.090> you<00:01:41.420> have<00:01:41.780> a<00:01:41.990> lot<00:01:42.320> of

00:01:42.340 --> 00:01:42.350 
much detail unless you have a lot of

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:46.179 
much detail unless you have a lot of
practice<00:01:42.950> and<00:01:43.390> experience<00:01:44.390> with<00:01:44.990> it<00:01:45.170> so<00:01:45.920> I

00:01:46.179 --> 00:01:46.189 
practice and experience with it so I

00:01:46.189 --> 00:01:47.649 
practice and experience with it so I
can't<00:01:46.460> really<00:01:46.549> say<00:01:46.789> too<00:01:46.850> much<00:01:47.030> about<00:01:47.090> that<00:01:47.450> cuz

00:01:47.649 --> 00:01:47.659 
can't really say too much about that cuz

00:01:47.659 --> 00:01:51.419 
can't really say too much about that cuz
I<00:01:47.750> obviously<00:01:48.319> don't<00:01:48.880> but<00:01:49.880> what<00:01:50.000> I<00:01:50.030> do<00:01:50.149> know<00:01:50.299> is

00:01:51.419 --> 00:01:51.429 
I obviously don't but what I do know is

00:01:51.429 --> 00:01:53.859 
I obviously don't but what I do know is
anyone<00:01:52.429> that's<00:01:52.610> looking<00:01:52.969> to<00:01:53.329> get<00:01:53.450> the<00:01:53.630> same

00:01:53.859 --> 00:01:53.869 
anyone that's looking to get the same

00:01:53.869 --> 00:01:57.039 
anyone that's looking to get the same
effect<00:01:54.049> I<00:01:55.090> suggest<00:01:56.090> looking<00:01:56.270> into<00:01:56.719> dye-based

00:01:57.039 --> 00:01:57.049 
effect I suggest looking into dye-based

00:01:57.049 --> 00:02:01.149

the list price on these is like six or
seven<00:02:08.539> dollars<00:02:09.019> which<00:02:09.619> is<00:02:09.649> kind<00:02:09.920> of<00:02:09.979> expensive
