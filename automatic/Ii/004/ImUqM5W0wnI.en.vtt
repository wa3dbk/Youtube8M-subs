to be a love-hate relationship
especially<00:01:30.990> because<00:01:31.500> earlier<00:01:31.920> versions<00:01:32.689> had

00:01:33.679 --> 00:01:33.689 
especially because earlier versions had

00:01:33.689 --> 00:01:36.410

00:02:50.820 --> 00:02:54.360 
back now on our server will now be
factions<00:02:51.820> of<00:02:51.970> course<00:02:52.600> we<00:02:52.810> will<00:02:53.050> have<00:02:54.010> to

00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:54.370 
factions of course we will have to

00:02:54.370 --> 00:02:58.160 
factions of course we will have to
reboot<00:02:54.820> the<00:02:55.030> server<00:02:55.270> in<00:02:55.570> order<00:02:56.080> to<00:02:56.500> get<00:02:57.100> that

00:02:58.160 --> 00:02:58.170 
reboot the server in order to get that

00:02:58.170 --> 00:03:01.380 
reboot the server in order to get that
properly<00:02:59.170> done<00:02:59.620> so<00:03:00.190> we<00:03:00.370> will<00:03:00.460> simply<00:03:00.670> restart

00:03:01.380 --> 00:03:01.390 
properly done so we will simply restart

00:03:01.390 --> 00:03:07.230 
properly done so we will simply restart
the<00:03:01.570> server

00:03:07.230 --> 00:03:07.240 

00:03:07.240 --> 00:03:12.480 

and<00:03:07.620> once<00:03:08.620> that<00:03:08.710> is<00:03:08.980> fully<00:03:09.430> rebooted<00:03:11.370> see<00:03:12.370> it

00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:12.490 
and once that is fully rebooted see it

00:03:12.490 --> 00:03:15.000 
and once that is fully rebooted see it
says<00:03:12.730> online<00:03:13.000> zero<00:03:13.750> out<00:03:13.840> of<00:03:13.900> ten<00:03:13.990> players<00:03:14.410> we

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:15.010 
says online zero out of ten players we

00:03:15.010 --> 00:03:19.680 
says online zero out of ten players we
can<00:03:15.160> now<00:03:15.310> look<00:03:15.550> in<00:03:15.700> our<00:03:15.790> console<00:03:17.400> and<00:03:18.540> if<00:03:19.540> you

00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:19.690 
can now look in our console and if you

00:03:19.690 --> 00:03:21.990 
can now look in our console and if you
look<00:03:20.020> at<00:03:20.260> the<00:03:20.500> boot<00:03:20.770> up<00:03:20.920> sequence<00:03:21.310> it<00:03:21.580> does<00:03:21.790> in

00:03:21.990 --> 00:03:22.000 
look at the boot up sequence it does in

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:25.350 
look at the boot up sequence it does in
fact<00:03:22.030> say<00:03:22.780> that<00:03:23.410> factions<00:03:24.220> is<00:03:24.400> booted<00:03:25.030> up<00:03:25.150> I<00:03:25.300> do

00:03:25.350 --> 00:03:25.360 
fact say that factions is booted up I do

00:03:25.360 --> 00:03:27.690 
fact say that factions is booted up I do
recommend<00:03:25.810> taking<00:03:26.590> a<00:03:26.830> look<00:03:26.860> at<00:03:27.130> this<00:03:27.250> every

00:03:27.690 --> 00:03:27.700 
recommend taking a look at this every

00:03:27.700 --> 00:03:29.820 
recommend taking a look at this every
time<00:03:28.150> you<00:03:28.390> reboot<00:03:28.690> and<00:03:29.080> some<00:03:29.320> things<00:03:29.500> change

00:03:29.820 --> 00:03:29.830 
time you reboot and some things change

00:03:29.830 --> 00:03:31.410 
time you reboot and some things change
to<00:03:30.010> either<00:03:30.100> configurations<00:03:30.910> or<00:03:31.000> whatnot

00:03:31.410 --> 00:03:31.420 
to either configurations or whatnot

00:03:31.420 --> 00:03:33.690 
to either configurations or whatnot
because<00:03:31.960> important<00:03:32.620> messages<00:03:33.070> do<00:03:33.280> in<00:03:33.520> fact

00:03:33.690 --> 00:03:33.700 
because important messages do in fact

00:03:33.700 --> 00:03:38.220 
because important messages do in fact
come<00:03:34.090> up<00:03:34.270> here<00:03:34.990> in<00:03:35.200> the<00:03:35.320> console<00:03:36.990> let's<00:03:37.990> see

00:03:38.220 --> 00:03:38.230 
come up here in the console let's see

00:03:38.230 --> 00:03:41.520 
come up here in the console let's see
and<00:03:38.730> it<00:03:39.730> looks<00:03:39.880> like<00:03:40.030> essentials<00:03:40.840> is<00:03:40.990> also

00:03:41.520 --> 00:03:41.530 
and it looks like essentials is also

00:03:41.530 --> 00:03:49.280 
and it looks like essentials is also
loaded<00:03:42.070> we<00:03:42.190> can<00:03:42.340> see<00:03:42.610> that<00:03:42.820> here<00:03:44.670> right<00:03:48.180> now

00:03:49.280 --> 00:03:49.290 
loaded we can see that here right now

00:03:49.290 --> 00:03:57.240 
loaded we can see that here right now
what<00:03:50.290> we<00:03:50.440> should<00:03:50.740> do<00:03:51.010> is<00:03:51.510> hit<00:03:52.510> back<00:03:55.890> now<00:03:56.890> we<00:03:56.950> can

00:03:57.240 --> 00:03:57.250 
what we should do is hit back now we can

00:03:57.250 --> 00:04:04.860 
what we should do is hit back now we can
go<00:03:57.430> to<00:03:57.490> files<00:03:59.760> we<00:04:00.760> can<00:04:00.910> go<00:04:01.030> to<00:04:01.090> config<00:04:01.720> files

00:04:04.860 --> 00:04:04.870 

00:04:04.870 --> 00:04:08.570 

and<00:04:05.190> indeed<00:04:06.190> if<00:04:06.489> you<00:04:06.549> look<00:04:06.849> here<00:04:07.209> we<00:04:07.360> have<00:04:07.569> the

00:04:08.570 --> 00:04:08.580 
and indeed if you look here we have the

00:04:08.580 --> 00:04:11.550 
and indeed if you look here we have the
YAML<00:04:09.580> files<00:04:10.060> or<00:04:10.360> the<00:04:10.569> settings<00:04:10.930> files<00:04:11.230> rather

00:04:11.550 --> 00:04:11.560 
YAML files or the settings files rather

00:04:11.560 --> 00:04:16.650 
YAML files or the settings files rather
for<00:04:13.290> for<00:04:14.290> both<00:04:14.530> essentials<00:04:15.310> and<00:04:15.610> if<00:04:15.879> we<00:04:16.090> look

00:04:16.650 --> 00:04:16.660 
for for both essentials and if we look

00:04:16.660 --> 00:04:19.430 
for for both essentials and if we look
we<00:04:17.109> should<00:04:17.320> also<00:04:17.440> find<00:04:17.919> it<00:04:18.130> for<00:04:18.370> factions

00:04:19.430 --> 00:04:19.440 
we should also find it for factions

00:04:19.440 --> 00:04:23.340 
we should also find it for factions
let's<00:04:20.440> go<00:04:20.620> to<00:04:20.680> page<00:04:20.949> number<00:04:21.340> two<00:04:21.960> that's<00:04:22.960> world

00:04:23.340 --> 00:04:23.350 
let's go to page number two that's world

00:04:23.350 --> 00:04:30.700 
let's go to page number two that's world
at<00:04:23.620> it

00:04:30.700 --> 00:04:30.710 

00:04:30.710 --> 00:04:33.230 

alright<00:04:31.710> looks<00:04:32.160> like<00:04:32.340> factions<00:04:32.850> actually

00:04:33.230 --> 00:04:33.240 
alright looks like factions actually

00:04:33.240 --> 00:04:34.700 
alright looks like factions actually
isn't<00:04:33.480> showing<00:04:33.900> up<00:04:34.080> and<00:04:34.260> there<00:04:34.410> are<00:04:34.500> two

00:04:34.700 --> 00:04:34.710 
isn't showing up and there are two

00:04:34.710 --> 00:04:38.560 
isn't showing up and there are two
reasons<00:04:34.740> for<00:04:35.340> that<00:04:35.580> first<00:04:36.450> off<00:04:36.690> factions<00:04:37.590> says

00:04:38.560 --> 00:04:38.570 
reasons for that first off factions says

00:04:38.570 --> 00:04:43.750 
reasons for that first off factions says
specifically<00:04:39.570> to<00:04:40.410> not<00:04:40.740> use<00:04:41.520> the<00:04:42.270> config<00:04:42.810> files

00:04:43.750 --> 00:04:43.760 
specifically to not use the config files

00:04:43.760 --> 00:04:47.360 
specifically to not use the config files
to<00:04:44.760> edit<00:04:45.180> your<00:04:45.210> your<00:04:45.870> faction<00:04:46.680> sex<00:04:46.950> they

00:04:47.360 --> 00:04:47.370 
to edit your your faction sex they

00:04:47.370 --> 00:04:49.550 
to edit your your faction sex they
actually<00:04:47.730> want<00:04:48.000> you<00:04:48.210> to<00:04:48.450> use<00:04:48.720> the<00:04:49.110> in-game

00:04:49.550 --> 00:04:49.560 
actually want you to use the in-game

00:04:49.560 --> 00:04:52.250 
actually want you to use the in-game
commands<00:04:50.190> the<00:04:50.700> second<00:04:51.150> being<00:04:51.390> that<00:04:51.990> it<00:04:52.080> looks

00:04:52.250 --> 00:04:52.260 
commands the second being that it looks

00:04:52.260 --> 00:04:54.320 
commands the second being that it looks
like<00:04:52.470> the<00:04:52.650> panel<00:04:53.010> is<00:04:53.190> not<00:04:53.400> recognizing<00:04:54.120> it

00:04:54.320 --> 00:04:54.330 
like the panel is not recognizing it

00:04:54.330 --> 00:04:56.360 
like the panel is not recognizing it
because<00:04:54.480> it's<00:04:54.630> not<00:04:54.780> a<00:04:54.840> yml<00:04:55.440> file<00:04:55.740> I<00:04:55.950> believe<00:04:56.220> it

00:04:56.360 --> 00:04:56.370 
because it's not a yml file I believe it

00:04:56.370 --> 00:05:02.060 
because it's not a yml file I believe it
they<00:04:56.490> use<00:04:57.950> some<00:04:58.950> other<00:04:59.190> file<00:05:00.000> setting<00:05:00.570> so<00:05:01.110> we

00:05:02.060 --> 00:05:02.070 
they use some other file setting so we

00:05:02.070 --> 00:05:04.790 
they use some other file setting so we
would<00:05:02.340> actually<00:05:02.550> have<00:05:03.030> to<00:05:03.060> go<00:05:03.480> and<00:05:03.720> look<00:05:04.500> at

00:05:04.790 --> 00:05:04.800 
would actually have to go and look at

00:05:04.800 --> 00:05:09.110 
would actually have to go and look at
the<00:05:05.930> either<00:05:06.930> the<00:05:07.460> ftp<00:05:08.460> which<00:05:08.670> is<00:05:08.850> either

00:05:09.110 --> 00:05:09.120 
the either the ftp which is either

00:05:09.120 --> 00:05:11.960 
the either the ftp which is either
filezilla<00:05:09.840> or<00:05:10.050> the<00:05:10.200> built-in<00:05:10.620> ftp<00:05:11.040> client

00:05:11.960 --> 00:05:11.970 
filezilla or the built-in ftp client

00:05:11.970 --> 00:05:16.550 
filezilla or the built-in ftp client
here<00:05:12.270> I<00:05:12.450> do<00:05:13.020> recommend<00:05:13.500> using<00:05:14.570> FileZilla<00:05:15.570> for

00:05:16.550 --> 00:05:16.560 
here I do recommend using FileZilla for

00:05:16.560 --> 00:05:19.820 
here I do recommend using FileZilla for
a<00:05:16.590> couple<00:05:16.950> of<00:05:17.010> reasons<00:05:17.990> it<00:05:18.990> does<00:05:19.380> have<00:05:19.680> an

00:05:19.820 --> 00:05:19.830 
a couple of reasons it does have an

00:05:19.830 --> 00:05:23.210 
a couple of reasons it does have an
automatic<00:05:20.190> edit<00:05:21.560> function<00:05:22.560> in<00:05:22.680> it<00:05:22.830> that

00:05:23.210 --> 00:05:23.220 
automatic edit function in it that

00:05:23.220 --> 00:05:24.890 
automatic edit function in it that
allows<00:05:23.460> you<00:05:23.610> to<00:05:23.730> edit<00:05:23.880> your<00:05:24.000> file<00:05:24.330> and<00:05:24.720> then

00:05:24.890 --> 00:05:24.900 
allows you to edit your file and then

00:05:24.900 --> 00:05:28.220 
allows you to edit your file and then
ship<00:05:25.290> it<00:05:25.410> right<00:05:25.470> back<00:05:25.890> to<00:05:26.460> the<00:05:26.610> server<00:05:27.230> the

00:05:28.220 --> 00:05:28.230 
ship it right back to the server the

00:05:28.230 --> 00:05:30.560 
ship it right back to the server the
second<00:05:28.650> reason<00:05:28.830> is<00:05:29.280> if<00:05:29.520> you<00:05:29.940> ever<00:05:30.090> do<00:05:30.390> decide

00:05:30.560 --> 00:05:30.570 
second reason is if you ever do decide

00:05:30.570 --> 00:05:34.400 
second reason is if you ever do decide
to<00:05:31.200> move<00:05:31.440> up<00:05:31.740> to<00:05:32.100> a<00:05:32.130> VPS<00:05:32.760> or<00:05:33.320> something<00:05:34.320> along

00:05:34.400 --> 00:05:34.410 
to move up to a VPS or something along

00:05:34.410 --> 00:05:37.100 
to move up to a VPS or something along
those<00:05:34.680> lines<00:05:34.910> that<00:05:35.910> will<00:05:36.090> also<00:05:36.390> help<00:05:36.630> you

00:05:37.100 --> 00:05:37.110 
those lines that will also help you

00:05:37.110 --> 00:05:41.060 
those lines that will also help you
immensely<00:05:38.420> because<00:05:39.420> it<00:05:39.930> kind<00:05:40.290> of<00:05:40.350> trains<00:05:40.800> you

00:05:41.060 --> 00:05:41.070 
immensely because it kind of trains you

00:05:41.070 --> 00:05:45.110 
immensely because it kind of trains you

00:05:45.110 --> 00:05:45.120 
to think in that way all right now

00:05:45.120 --> 00:05:47.180 
to think in that way all right now
seeing<00:05:45.630> as<00:05:45.720> we<00:05:45.840> already<00:05:45.990> have<00:05:46.350> the<00:05:46.500> essentials

00:05:47.180 --> 00:05:47.190

ahead<00:05:49.890> we're<00:05:50.130> going<00:05:50.250> to<00:05:50.310> look<00:05:50.550> at<00:05:50.670> those<00:05:52.490> and

00:05:53.860 --> 00:05:53.870 
ahead we're going to look at those and

ahead we're going to look at those and
now<00:05:54.870> you<00:05:54.930> will<00:05:55.320> see<00:05:55.350> here<00:05:56.010> anything<00:05:56.730> with<00:05:56.940> this
