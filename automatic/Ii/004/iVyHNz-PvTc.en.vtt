00:04:28.090 --> 00:04:28.100 
double one two okay a three and then one

00:04:28.100 --> 00:04:30.250 
double one two okay a three and then one
galaxy<00:04:28.400> serpent<00:04:28.910> was<00:04:29.150> that<00:04:29.270> double<00:04:29.900> galaxy

00:04:30.250 --> 00:04:30.260 
galaxy serpent was that double galaxy

00:04:30.260 --> 00:04:33.070 
galaxy serpent was that double galaxy
serpent<00:04:31.330> that's<00:04:32.330> just<00:04:32.480> more<00:04:32.630> targets<00:04:32.960> for

00:04:33.070 --> 00:04:33.080 
serpent that's just more targets for

00:04:33.080 --> 00:04:34.960 
serpent that's just more targets for
cards<00:04:33.290> of<00:04:33.380> consonance<00:04:33.470> okay<00:04:34.190> and<00:04:34.400> then<00:04:34.850> my

00:04:34.960 --> 00:04:34.970 
cards of consonance okay and then my

00:04:34.970 --> 00:04:39.310 
cards of consonance okay and then my
guess<00:04:35.030> is<00:04:35.270> triple<00:04:35.660> flamvell<00:04:35.870> guard<00:04:36.370> and<00:04:38.320> two

00:04:39.310 --> 00:04:39.320 
guess is triple flamvell guard and two

00:04:39.320 --> 00:04:41.020 
guess is triple flamvell guard and two
galaxies<00:04:39.680> serving<00:04:39.980> a<00:04:40.070> two<00:04:40.250> galaxy<00:04:40.610> serpent

00:04:41.020 --> 00:04:41.030 
galaxies serving a two galaxy serpent

00:04:41.030 --> 00:04:43.540 
galaxies serving a two galaxy serpent
and<00:04:41.120> once<00:04:41.960> I<00:04:42.200> get<00:04:42.440> the<00:04:42.650> dark<00:04:42.860> Club<00:04:43.040> to<00:04:43.280> saggi

00:04:43.540 --> 00:04:43.550 
and once I get the dark Club to saggi

00:04:43.550 --> 00:04:45.940 
and once I get the dark Club to saggi
the<00:04:43.670> dark<00:04:43.760> clown<00:04:44.000> okay<00:04:44.600> and<00:04:45.560> then<00:04:45.710> we've<00:04:45.800> got

00:04:45.940 --> 00:04:45.950 
the dark clown okay and then we've got

00:04:45.950 --> 00:04:47.200 
the dark clown okay and then we've got
three<00:04:46.130> cards<00:04:46.430> of<00:04:46.460> consonance<00:04:46.550> three<00:04:47.030> try

00:04:47.200 --> 00:04:47.210 
three cards of consonance three try

00:04:47.210 --> 00:04:49.360 
three cards of consonance three try
right<00:04:47.390> three<00:04:47.630> what<00:04:47.780> elephant<00:04:48.110> skipped<00:04:48.370> wonder

00:04:49.360 --> 00:04:49.370 
right three what elephant skipped wonder

00:04:49.370 --> 00:04:51.580 
right three what elephant skipped wonder
one<00:04:49.580> we<00:04:49.850> are<00:04:50.030> playing<00:04:50.450> three<00:04:51.020> wonder<00:04:51.410> ones

00:04:51.580 --> 00:04:51.590 
one we are playing three wonder ones

00:04:51.590 --> 00:04:55.030 
one we are playing three wonder ones
okay<00:04:52.370> and<00:04:53.170> one<00:04:54.170> dark<00:04:54.350> factor<00:04:54.680> two<00:04:54.830> dark

00:04:55.030 --> 00:04:55.040 
okay and one dark factor two dark

00:04:55.040 --> 00:04:56.410 
okay and one dark factor two dark
factoring<00:04:55.490> do<00:04:55.730> we<00:04:55.820> have<00:04:55.910> a<00:04:55.940> three<00:04:56.210> dark

00:04:56.410 --> 00:04:56.420 
factoring do we have a three dark

00:04:56.420 --> 00:04:57.790 
factoring do we have a three dark
factory<00:04:56.630> three<00:04:57.110> dark<00:04:57.290> factory<00:04:57.500> of<00:04:57.740> mass

00:04:57.790 --> 00:04:57.800 
factory three dark factory of mass

factory three dark factory of mass
production<00:04:57.950> olinson<00:04:58.700> fusion<00:04:59.210> I<00:04:59.360> mean<00:05:00.320> that

00:05:00.460 --> 00:05:00.470 
production olinson fusion I mean that

00:05:00.470 --> 00:05:02.080 
production olinson fusion I mean that
should<00:05:00.740> pretty<00:05:01.160> much<00:05:01.250> cover<00:05:01.340> it<00:05:01.760> if<00:05:01.880> there's

00:05:02.080 --> 00:05:02.090 
should pretty much cover it if there's

00:05:02.090 --> 00:05:03.040 
should pretty much cover it if there's
anything<00:05:02.210> I<00:05:02.330> missed<00:05:02.360> out<00:05:02.630> I<00:05:02.660> mean<00:05:02.840> you<00:05:02.930> could

00:05:03.040 --> 00:05:03.050 
anything I missed out I mean you could

00:05:03.050 --> 00:05:04.870 
anything I missed out I mean you could
pause<00:05:03.200> the<00:05:03.380> video<00:05:03.590> but<00:05:03.680> I'm<00:05:03.770> trying<00:05:03.980> to<00:05:04.040> do<00:05:04.730> it

00:05:06.730 --> 00:05:06.740 
I guess off the top of like my head by

00:05:06.740 --> 00:05:08.350 
I guess off the top of like my head by
just<00:05:06.950> going<00:05:07.190> through<00:05:07.250> this<00:05:07.490> but<00:05:07.730> that<00:05:08.240> is<00:05:08.270> a

great because like what are you gonna be
like<00:05:18.530> he<00:05:18.650> obviously<00:05:18.920> it's<00:05:19.580> a<00:05:19.670> burn<00:05:19.850> deck<00:05:20.060> and

00:05:20.230 --> 00:05:20.240 
like he obviously it's a burn deck and

00:05:20.240 --> 00:05:21.820 
like he obviously it's a burn deck and
he<00:05:20.420> doesn't<00:05:20.570> oh<00:05:20.720> never<00:05:21.320> mind

00:05:21.820 --> 00:05:21.830 
he doesn't oh never mind

00:05:21.830 --> 00:05:23.740 
he doesn't oh never mind
it<00:05:21.890> is<00:05:22.310> not<00:05:22.460> a<00:05:22.490> burn<00:05:22.820> deck<00:05:23.030> well<00:05:23.390> I<00:05:23.570> mean

00:05:23.740 --> 00:05:23.750 
it is not a burn deck well I mean

00:05:23.750 --> 00:05:25.480 
it is not a burn deck well I mean
technically<00:05:24.290> it<00:05:24.560> is<00:05:24.680> kind<00:05:24.950> of<00:05:24.980> a<00:05:25.070> burn<00:05:25.250> deck<00:05:25.370> in

00:05:25.480 --> 00:05:25.490 
technically it is kind of a burn deck in

00:05:25.490 --> 00:05:27.580 
technically it is kind of a burn deck in
one<00:05:25.670> sense<00:05:25.880> but<00:05:26.030> it's<00:05:26.330> an<00:05:26.600> inferno<00:05:26.990> tempest

00:05:27.580 --> 00:05:27.590 
one sense but it's an inferno tempest

00:05:27.590 --> 00:05:28.990 
one sense but it's an inferno tempest
burn<00:05:27.800> deck<00:05:28.010> which<00:05:28.220> basically<00:05:28.610> gets<00:05:28.820> out

00:05:28.990 --> 00:05:29.000 
burn deck which basically gets out

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:30.790 
burn deck which basically gets out
grinder<00:05:29.330> golem<00:05:29.660> although<00:05:30.290> you<00:05:30.710> know

00:05:30.790 --> 00:05:30.800 
grinder golem although you know

00:05:30.800 --> 00:05:32.740 
grinder golem although you know
obviously<00:05:31.340> this<00:05:31.490> guy's<00:05:31.640> playing<00:05:31.880> quasar<00:05:32.360> he's

00:05:32.740 --> 00:05:32.750 
obviously this guy's playing quasar he's

00:05:32.750 --> 00:05:34.540 
obviously this guy's playing quasar he's
never<00:05:32.930> gonna<00:05:33.080> attack<00:05:33.440> and<00:05:33.680> he's<00:05:34.190> not<00:05:34.340> playing

00:05:34.540 --> 00:05:34.550 
never gonna attack and he's not playing

00:05:34.550 --> 00:05:36.250 
never gonna attack and he's not playing
some<00:05:34.790> card<00:05:35.000> forces<00:05:35.360> him<00:05:35.540> to<00:05:35.570> attack<00:05:35.810> anyways

00:05:36.250 --> 00:05:36.260 
some card forces him to attack anyways

00:05:36.260 --> 00:05:38.440 
some card forces him to attack anyways
but<00:05:36.610> because<00:05:37.610> I<00:05:37.670> think<00:05:37.730> you<00:05:37.940> don't<00:05:38.180> have<00:05:38.270> to

00:05:38.440 --> 00:05:38.450 
but because I think you don't have to

00:05:38.450 --> 00:05:40.630 
but because I think you don't have to
declare<00:05:38.570> an<00:05:38.780> attack<00:05:38.960> when<00:05:39.800> you<00:05:39.860> take<00:05:40.070> 3,000<00:05:40.580> or

00:05:40.630 --> 00:05:40.640 
declare an attack when you take 3,000 or

00:05:40.640 --> 00:05:41.920 
declare an attack when you take 3,000 or
more<00:05:40.670> battle<00:05:41.000> damage<00:05:41.270> okay<00:05:41.600> so<00:05:41.660> then

00:05:41.920 --> 00:05:41.930 
more battle damage okay so then

00:05:41.930 --> 00:05:44.740 
more battle damage okay so then
obviously<00:05:42.640> yeah<00:05:43.640> the<00:05:44.150> quasar<00:05:44.450> guy<00:05:44.570> will<00:05:44.720> just

00:05:44.740 --> 00:05:44.750 
obviously yeah the quasar guy will just

00:05:44.750 --> 00:05:46.900 
obviously yeah the quasar guy will just
make<00:05:45.020> boys<00:05:45.200> are<00:05:45.350> just<00:05:45.530> Exodia<00:05:46.010> in<00:05:46.040> him<00:05:46.220> I<00:05:46.400> bet

00:05:46.900 --> 00:05:46.910 
make boys are just Exodia in him I bet

00:05:46.910 --> 00:05:48.940 
make boys are just Exodia in him I bet
you<00:05:47.030> think<00:05:47.240> zodia<00:05:47.720> guy<00:05:47.900> or<00:05:48.170> the<00:05:48.620> player<00:05:48.830> that

00:05:48.940 --> 00:05:48.950 
you think zodia guy or the player that

00:05:48.950 --> 00:05:50.260 
you think zodia guy or the player that
was<00:05:49.040> playing<00:05:49.220> the<00:05:49.340> broom<00:05:49.460> got<00:05:49.640> really<00:05:49.940> excited
