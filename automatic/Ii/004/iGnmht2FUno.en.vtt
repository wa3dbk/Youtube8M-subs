00:04:44.510 --> 00:04:44.520 
said screw do its the breather screwed

00:04:44.520 --> 00:04:46.680 
said screw do its the breather screwed
down<00:04:45.520> that's<00:04:45.790> on<00:04:45.910> a<00:04:45.940> late<00:04:46.150> bike<00:04:46.360> like

00:04:46.680 --> 00:04:46.690 
down that's on a late bike like

00:04:54.510 --> 00:04:54.520 
started putting that crap in there this

00:04:54.520 --> 00:05:02.280 
started putting that crap in there this
is<00:04:54.730> an<00:04:54.820> earlier<00:04:55.270> bike<00:04:55.780> yeah<00:05:00.840> see<00:05:01.840> I<00:05:01.900> walked<00:05:02.140> to

00:05:02.280 --> 00:05:02.290 
is an earlier bike yeah see I walked to

00:05:02.290 --> 00:05:03.750 
is an earlier bike yeah see I walked to
have<00:05:02.380> none<00:05:02.620> officially<00:05:03.070> locked<00:05:03.280> in<00:05:03.490> every

00:05:03.750 --> 00:05:03.760 
have none officially locked in every

00:05:03.760 --> 00:05:05.720 
have none officially locked in every
well<00:05:03.940> either<00:05:04.120> so<00:05:04.300> I'm<00:05:04.600> gonna<00:05:04.750> go<00:05:04.840> ahead<00:05:04.900> and

00:05:05.720 --> 00:05:05.730 
well either so I'm gonna go ahead and

00:05:05.730 --> 00:05:08.340 
well either so I'm gonna go ahead and
bend<00:05:06.730> that<00:05:06.850> around<00:05:07.120> out<00:05:07.750> of<00:05:07.810> the<00:05:07.930> way<00:05:08.110> of<00:05:08.260> the

00:05:08.340 --> 00:05:08.350 
bend that around out of the way of the

00:05:08.350 --> 00:05:15.939 
bend that around out of the way of the
screw<00:05:09.240> see<00:05:10.240> that

00:05:15.939 --> 00:05:15.949 

00:05:15.949 --> 00:05:20.540 

and<00:05:16.949> I<00:05:17.009> already<00:05:17.280> previously<00:05:18.979> cathode<00:05:19.979> and<00:05:20.280> if

00:05:20.540 --> 00:05:20.550 
and I already previously cathode and if

00:05:20.550 --> 00:05:25.640 
and I already previously cathode and if
the<00:05:20.610> screws<00:05:20.849> are<00:05:21.000> good<00:05:24.229> these<00:05:25.229> the<00:05:25.380> ones<00:05:25.530> over

00:05:25.640 --> 00:05:25.650 
the screws are good these the ones over

00:05:25.650 --> 00:05:29.089 
the screws are good these the ones over
here<00:05:25.770> the<00:05:25.919> ones<00:05:26.069> are<00:05:26.160> repaired<00:05:26.550> so<00:05:28.009> there's<00:05:29.009> a

00:05:29.089 --> 00:05:29.099 
here the ones are repaired so there's a

00:05:29.099 --> 00:05:30.740 
here the ones are repaired so there's a
slight<00:05:29.280> misalignment<00:05:29.759> the<00:05:30.240> hole<00:05:30.389> it'd<00:05:30.660> be

00:05:30.740 --> 00:05:30.750 
slight misalignment the hole it'd be

00:05:30.750 --> 00:05:37.999 
slight misalignment the hole it'd be
like<00:05:30.900> this<00:05:31.080> would<00:05:31.319> be<00:05:31.410> slightly<00:05:31.680> tight<00:05:36.949> get<00:05:37.949> a

00:05:37.999 --> 00:05:38.009 
like this would be slightly tight get a

00:05:38.009 --> 00:05:41.930 
like this would be slightly tight get a
picture<00:05:38.220> of<00:05:38.340> the<00:05:38.520> machining<00:05:39.030> it<00:05:39.150> did<00:05:40.190> a<00:05:41.190> little

00:05:41.930 --> 00:05:41.940 
picture of the machining it did a little

00:05:41.940 --> 00:05:43.640 
picture of the machining it did a little
bit<00:05:42.060> not<00:05:42.240> to<00:05:42.360> mess<00:05:42.569> with<00:05:42.599> us<00:05:42.870> doing<00:05:43.500> everything

00:05:43.640 --> 00:05:43.650 
bit not to mess with us doing everything

00:05:43.650 --> 00:05:44.360 
bit not to mess with us doing everything
by<00:05:43.800> one<00:05:43.979> hand

00:05:44.360 --> 00:05:44.370 
by one hand

00:05:44.370 --> 00:05:50.060 
by one hand
yeah<00:05:45.979> no<00:05:46.979> welding<00:05:47.930> about<00:05:48.930> video<00:05:49.470> welding<00:05:49.889> yet

00:05:50.060 --> 00:05:50.070 
yeah no welding about video welding yet

00:05:50.070 --> 00:05:54.379 
yeah no welding about video welding yet
I<00:05:51.979> don't<00:05:52.979> want<00:05:53.220> to<00:05:53.310> test<00:05:53.520> my<00:05:53.669> camera<00:05:54.060> see<00:05:54.210> if<00:05:54.240> it

00:05:54.379 --> 00:05:54.389 
I don't want to test my camera see if it

00:05:54.389 --> 00:05:56.659 
I don't want to test my camera see if it
gets<00:05:54.509> hurt<00:05:54.690> by<00:05:54.840> that<00:05:55.020> yeah<00:05:55.710> UV<00:05:56.190> so<00:05:56.460> I'm<00:05:56.550> not

00:05:56.659 --> 00:05:56.669 
gets hurt by that yeah UV so I'm not

00:05:56.669 --> 00:05:59.170 
gets hurt by that yeah UV so I'm not
gonna<00:05:56.789> do<00:05:56.970> it<00:05:57.169> and<00:05:58.169> I<00:05:58.259> tried<00:05:58.530> to<00:05:58.620> look

00:05:59.170 --> 00:05:59.180 
gonna do it and I tried to look

00:05:59.180 --> 00:06:01.969 
gonna do it and I tried to look

videotaping through the hood and all you
see<00:06:02.160> is<00:06:02.190> the<00:06:02.340> back<00:06:02.490> side<00:06:02.729> of<00:06:02.759> the<00:06:02.849> hood<00:06:03.000> you

00:06:03.170 --> 00:06:03.180 
see is the back side of the hood you

00:06:03.180 --> 00:06:04.520 
see is the back side of the hood you
don't<00:06:03.330> see<00:06:03.479> anything<00:06:03.930> through<00:06:04.110> the<00:06:04.229> limits

00:06:04.520 --> 00:06:04.530 
don't see anything through the limits

00:06:04.530 --> 00:06:09.980 
don't see anything through the limits
I'm<00:06:05.150> not<00:06:06.150> sure<00:06:06.300> how<00:06:06.419> we're<00:06:06.570> gonna<00:06:06.630> do<00:06:06.810> that<00:06:08.990> but

00:06:09.980 --> 00:06:09.990 
I'm not sure how we're gonna do that but

00:06:09.990 --> 00:06:11.450 
I'm not sure how we're gonna do that but
a<00:06:10.050> sub<00:06:10.289> point<00:06:10.500> when<00:06:10.590> you<00:06:10.650> just<00:06:10.770> boiling<00:06:11.069> video
