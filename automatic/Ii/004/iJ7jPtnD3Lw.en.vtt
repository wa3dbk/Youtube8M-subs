the game will be AR or SMG dominant for
my<00:01:47.670> personal<00:01:47.909> experience<00:01:48.630> of<00:01:48.750> playing<00:01:48.899> the

00:01:49.039 --> 00:01:49.049 
my personal experience of playing the

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:51.780 
game at Gamescom and egx i'm thinking

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:53.569 
game at Gamescom and egx i'm thinking
it's<00:01:52.020> gonna<00:01:52.110> be<00:01:52.380> leaning<00:01:52.799> more<00:01:52.950> towards<00:01:53.490> the

00:01:53.569 --> 00:01:53.579 
it's gonna be leaning more towards the

00:01:53.579 --> 00:01:55.819 
it's gonna be leaning more towards the
SMG<00:01:54.060> just<00:01:54.360> because<00:01:54.570> of<00:01:54.659> how<00:01:54.810> fast<00:01:55.259> paced<00:01:55.680> the

00:01:55.819 --> 00:01:55.829 
SMG just because of how fast paced the

00:01:55.829 --> 00:01:57.709 
SMG just because of how fast paced the
game<00:01:56.070> is<00:01:56.310> especially<00:01:57.090> in<00:01:57.180> competitive

00:01:57.709 --> 00:01:57.719 
game is especially in competitive

00:01:57.719 --> 00:01:59.270 
game is especially in competitive
because<00:01:57.840> the<00:01:57.990> game<00:01:58.170> is<00:01:58.320> sold<00:01:58.649> fast<00:01:59.009> pace

00:01:59.270 --> 00:01:59.280 
because the game is sold fast pace

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:01.010 
because the game is sold fast pace
because<00:01:59.399> the<00:01:59.640> exosuit<00:02:00.119> deities<00:02:00.600> people<00:02:00.930> are

00:02:01.010 --> 00:02:01.020 
because the exosuit deities people are

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:02.990 
because the exosuit deities people are
jumping<00:02:01.229> all<00:02:01.469> over<00:02:01.500> the<00:02:01.799> place<00:02:01.890> it's<00:02:02.549> hectic

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:03.000 
jumping all over the place it's hectic

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:05.060 
jumping all over the place it's hectic
it's<00:02:03.149> crazy<00:02:03.450> it's<00:02:03.899> everything<00:02:04.500> we<00:02:04.619> expect

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:05.070 
it's crazy it's everything we expect

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:07.609 
it's crazy it's everything we expect
from<00:02:05.250> a<00:02:05.369> call<00:02:05.520> of<00:02:05.640> duty<00:02:06.000> game<00:02:06.240> but<00:02:06.930> the<00:02:07.049> SMGs

00:02:07.609 --> 00:02:07.619 
from a call of duty game but the SMGs

00:02:07.619 --> 00:02:08.809 
from a call of duty game but the SMGs
will<00:02:07.770> just<00:02:07.950> give<00:02:08.099> you<00:02:08.129> car<00:02:08.369> that<00:02:08.520> extra

will just give you car that extra

00:02:08.819 --> 00:02:09.949 
will just give you car that extra
maneuverability<00:02:09.509> and<00:02:09.539> stuff<00:02:09.810> like<00:02:09.899> that

00:02:09.949 --> 00:02:09.959 
maneuverability and stuff like that

00:02:09.959 --> 00:02:13.100 
maneuverability and stuff like that
though<00:02:10.500> the<00:02:10.830> ARS<00:02:11.370> with<00:02:11.489> stock<00:02:11.819> and<00:02:12.030> stuff<00:02:12.300> will

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:13.110 
though the ARS with stock and stuff will

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:13.260 
though the ARS with stock and stuff will
be

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:13.270 
be

00:02:13.270 --> 00:02:14.970 
be
absolutely<00:02:13.990> awesome<00:02:14.230> as<00:02:14.530> well<00:02:14.710> and<00:02:14.890> that's

00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:14.980 
absolutely awesome as well and that's

00:02:14.980 --> 00:02:16.230 
absolutely awesome as well and that's
kind<00:02:15.220> of<00:02:15.250> probably<00:02:15.610> what<00:02:15.730> I<00:02:15.760> will<00:02:16.000> lean

00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:16.240 
kind of probably what I will lean

00:02:16.240 --> 00:02:18.180 
kind of probably what I will lean
towards<00:02:16.780> more<00:02:17.260> because<00:02:17.530> I<00:02:17.620> can't<00:02:17.830> like<00:02:18.010> those

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:18.190 
towards more because I can't like those

00:02:18.190 --> 00:02:19.920 
towards more because I can't like those

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:20.770 
around the map and getting in people's

00:02:20.770 --> 00:02:23.220 
around the map and getting in people's
faces<00:02:21.190> the<00:02:21.880> smts<00:02:22.360> are<00:02:22.570> definitely<00:02:22.990> going<00:02:23.140> to

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:23.230 
faces the smts are definitely going to

00:02:23.230 --> 00:02:25.500 
faces the smts are definitely going to
be<00:02:23.290> a<00:02:23.320> bit<00:02:23.470> more<00:02:23.590> dominant<00:02:24.030> the<00:02:25.030> next<00:02:25.330> question

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:25.510 
be a bit more dominant the next question

00:02:25.510 --> 00:02:28.290 
be a bit more dominant the next question
is<00:02:25.960> asked<00:02:26.500> by<00:02:26.560> Daniel<00:02:27.100> o'regan<00:02:27.640> who<00:02:27.760> are<00:02:27.940> other

is asked by Daniel o'regan who are other

00:02:28.300 --> 00:02:30.330 
is asked by Daniel o'regan who are other
maps<00:02:28.510> a<00:02:28.630> good<00:02:28.840> size<00:02:29.110> or<00:02:29.560> are<00:02:29.680> they<00:02:29.770> too<00:02:29.830> big<00:02:30.190> or

maps a good size or are they too big or
small<00:02:30.460> because<00:02:30.760> I<00:02:30.880> think<00:02:30.940> everyone<00:02:31.720> make

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:31.900 
small because I think everyone make

for so I don't think we're gonna see saw

00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:02.670 
for so I don't think we're gonna see saw
those<00:03:00.190> Maps<00:03:00.730> like<00:03:01.350> Stonehaven<00:03:02.350> that<00:03:02.530> was

00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:02.680 
those Maps like Stonehaven that was

00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:04.200 
those Maps like Stonehaven that was
encored<00:03:03.010> you<00:03:03.130> egos<00:03:03.490> because<00:03:03.820> it<00:03:03.910> will<00:03:04.000> kind<00:03:04.120> of

00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:04.210 
encored you egos because it will kind of

00:03:04.210 --> 00:03:06.510 
encored you egos because it will kind of
neglect<00:03:04.660> the<00:03:04.870> biggest<00:03:05.470> kind<00:03:05.680> of<00:03:05.800> unique

00:03:06.510 --> 00:03:06.520 
neglect the biggest kind of unique

00:03:06.520 --> 00:03:08.670 
neglect the biggest kind of unique
selling<00:03:06.940> point<00:03:07.270> of<00:03:07.390> advanced<00:03:08.110> warfare<00:03:08.530> which

00:03:08.670 --> 00:03:08.680 
selling point of advanced warfare which

00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:10.170 
selling point of advanced warfare which
is<00:03:08.800> the<00:03:08.890> exosuit<00:03:09.280> ability<00:03:09.670> we<00:03:09.820> kind<00:03:10.000> of<00:03:10.030> make

00:03:10.170 --> 00:03:10.180 
is the exosuit ability we kind of make

00:03:10.180 --> 00:03:12.000 
is the exosuit ability we kind of make
them<00:03:10.330> like<00:03:10.570> negate<00:03:10.990> how<00:03:11.320> effective<00:03:11.830> they<00:03:11.950> were

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:12.010 
them like negate how effective they were

00:03:12.010 --> 00:03:13.890 
them like negate how effective they were
if<00:03:12.250> the<00:03:12.370> map<00:03:12.550> was<00:03:12.730> absolutely<00:03:13.330> huge<00:03:13.630> and<00:03:13.780> you

00:03:13.890 --> 00:03:13.900 
if the map was absolutely huge and you

00:03:13.900 --> 00:03:16.170 
if the map was absolutely huge and you
can<00:03:14.050> dash<00:03:14.380> probably<00:03:14.890> from<00:03:15.580> ledge<00:03:15.760> to<00:03:15.790> ledge<00:03:16.000> so

00:03:16.170 --> 00:03:16.180 
can dash probably from ledge to ledge so

00:03:16.180 --> 00:03:18.300 
can dash probably from ledge to ledge so
I<00:03:16.240> think<00:03:16.300> the<00:03:16.570> maps<00:03:16.750> that<00:03:17.590> you've<00:03:17.770> seen<00:03:18.070> will

00:03:18.300 --> 00:03:18.310 
I think the maps that you've seen will

00:03:18.310 --> 00:03:19.980 
I think the maps that you've seen will
be<00:03:18.430> about<00:03:18.790> the<00:03:18.970> biggest<00:03:19.180> size<00:03:19.510> that<00:03:19.840> they're

00:03:19.980 --> 00:03:19.990 
be about the biggest size that they're

00:03:19.990 --> 00:03:22.980 
be about the biggest size that they're
gonna<00:03:20.170> be<00:03:20.459> and<00:03:21.459> so<00:03:21.790> I<00:03:21.820> think<00:03:22.300> they've<00:03:22.630> just<00:03:22.810> got

00:03:22.980 --> 00:03:22.990 
gonna be and so I think they've just got

00:03:22.990 --> 00:03:25.440 
gonna be and so I think they've just got
it<00:03:23.110> right<00:03:23.320> so<00:03:23.650> anyway<00:03:24.070> hopping<00:03:24.910> into<00:03:25.030> the<00:03:25.209> next

00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:25.450 
it right so anyway hopping into the next

00:03:25.450 --> 00:03:27.810 
it right so anyway hopping into the next

exes abilities because it's gonna be
interesting<00:03:55.300> because<00:03:55.600> players<00:03:55.930> who<00:03:56.200> kind<00:03:56.410> of

00:03:56.430 --> 00:03:56.440 
interesting because players who kind of

00:03:56.440 --> 00:03:58.320

neglect those abilities and don't use

00:03:58.330 --> 00:04:00.420 
neglect those abilities and don't use
them<00:03:58.570> will<00:03:59.320> definitely<00:03:59.770> fall<00:03:59.950> behind<00:04:00.130> and

00:04:00.420 --> 00:04:00.430 
them will definitely fall behind and

00:04:00.430 --> 00:04:01.920 
them will definitely fall behind and
won't<00:04:00.640> be<00:04:00.700> able<00:04:00.790> to<00:04:01.000> do<00:04:01.120> as<00:04:01.330> well<00:04:01.660> as<00:04:01.810> other

00:04:01.930 --> 00:04:03.090 
won't be able to do as well as other
players<00:04:02.200> so<00:04:02.380> it's<00:04:02.500> definitely<00:04:02.830> something

00:04:03.090 --> 00:04:03.100 
players so it's definitely something
