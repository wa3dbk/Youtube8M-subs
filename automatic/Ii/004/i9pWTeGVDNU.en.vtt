much<00:06:50.220> treadmill<00:06:50.640> you<00:06:51.090> lose<00:06:51.300> muscle<00:06:51.540> and<00:06:52.050> then

00:06:52.970 --> 00:06:52.980 
much treadmill you lose muscle and then

00:06:52.980 --> 00:06:54.830 
much treadmill you lose muscle and then
you<00:06:53.070> get<00:06:53.220> fatter<00:06:53.550> easier<00:06:54.030> because<00:06:54.210> if<00:06:54.540> you<00:06:54.630> as

00:06:54.830 --> 00:06:54.840 
you get fatter easier because if you as

you lose muscle your BMR your basal
metabolic<00:06:57.000> rate<00:06:57.360> goes<00:06:57.690> down<00:06:57.720> the<00:06:58.680> best<00:06:58.890> way<00:06:59.040> to
