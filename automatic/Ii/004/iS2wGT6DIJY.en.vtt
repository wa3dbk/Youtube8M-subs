00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:26.650 
so I'll just kind of position him

00:03:26.650 --> 00:03:29.789 
so I'll just kind of position him
towards<00:03:27.340> the<00:03:27.519> top<00:03:27.760> left<00:03:28.510> corner<00:03:29.019> giving<00:03:29.650> a

00:03:29.789 --> 00:03:29.799 
towards the top left corner giving a

00:03:29.799 --> 00:03:32.399 
towards the top left corner giving a
little<00:03:29.950> bit<00:03:30.220> of<00:03:30.340> edge<00:03:30.489> on<00:03:30.819> both<00:03:30.879> sides<00:03:31.420> to<00:03:32.230> give

00:03:32.399 --> 00:03:32.409 
little bit of edge on both sides to give

00:03:32.409 --> 00:03:34.530 
little bit of edge on both sides to give
me<00:03:32.590> a<00:03:32.620> little<00:03:32.799> room<00:03:32.919> and<00:03:33.370> because<00:03:34.239> I've<00:03:34.359> got

00:03:34.530 --> 00:03:34.540 
me a little room and because I've got

00:03:34.540 --> 00:03:36.210 
me a little room and because I've got
that<00:03:34.660> other<00:03:34.870> paper<00:03:35.230> down<00:03:35.650> I<00:03:35.680> can<00:03:35.950> kind<00:03:36.160> of

00:03:36.210 --> 00:03:36.220 
that other paper down I can kind of

00:03:36.220 --> 00:03:37.800 
that other paper down I can kind of
check<00:03:36.519> to<00:03:36.760> make<00:03:36.910> sure<00:03:36.970> I'm<00:03:37.329> getting<00:03:37.450> things

00:03:37.800 --> 00:03:37.810 
check to make sure I'm getting things

00:03:37.810 --> 00:03:40.080 
check to make sure I'm getting things
straight<00:03:38.470> by<00:03:39.069> kind<00:03:39.310> of<00:03:39.370> just<00:03:39.519> watching<00:03:39.669> where

00:03:40.080 --> 00:03:40.090 
straight by kind of just watching where

00:03:40.090 --> 00:03:42.000 
straight by kind of just watching where
the<00:03:40.120> sleeves<00:03:40.599> hit<00:03:40.870> for<00:03:41.049> example<00:03:41.440> on<00:03:41.620> the<00:03:41.769> sides

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:42.010 
the sleeves hit for example on the sides

00:03:42.010 --> 00:03:45.289 
the sleeves hit for example on the sides
there<00:03:42.310> and<00:03:42.579> then<00:03:43.450> I<00:03:43.750> can<00:03:44.079> go<00:03:44.200> ahead<00:03:44.379> and<00:03:44.739> take

00:03:45.289 --> 00:03:45.299 
there and then I can go ahead and take
