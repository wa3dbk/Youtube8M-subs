00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:15.510
 I've been vegan for thirty years 

00:00:11.760 --> 00:00:19.380
 though I did a couple of years though 

00:00:15.510 --> 00:00:22.020
 interruption I have to confess e 

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:24.780
 this to say and I say it willingly 

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:28.699
 this because because many times the 

00:00:24.780 --> 00:00:31.110
 people feel guilty when 

00:00:28.699 --> 00:00:33.530
 maybe they start a certain kind of 

00:00:31.110 --> 00:00:35.790
 path and then maybe not make it no 

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:38.730
 maybe they don't make it for a while 

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:40.530
 but to know to be able to return perhaps 

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:42.960
 stronger than before and more convinced than 

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:45.449
 first is that this also happened a 

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:48.180
 1 which I mean has studied if it is 

00:00:45.449 --> 00:00:49.680
 occupies and tries to inform even 

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:52.080
 others this can make others feel 

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:54.659
 don't worry if you don't 

00:00:52.080 --> 00:00:58.040
 it happens sometimes that maybe some 

00:00:54.659 --> 00:01:00.600
 reason one regresses temporarily 

00:00:58.040 --> 00:01:03.080
 there may be reasons 

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:04.920
 which must be understood but then it can be returned 

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:09.090
 more convinced than before 

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:12.090
 I am 54 years old as a physical activity 

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:13.890
 about a daily aerobic activity of 

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:16.440
 an hour an hour a day for 

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:19.020
 I mean I can run I can walk 

00:01:16.440 --> 00:01:21.120
 I can do an hour of swimming usually is 

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:23.820
 this is not my physical activity 

00:01:21.120 --> 00:01:25.860
 the days I can practice everything 

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:26.909
 this however we say that it is a 4 5 times 

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:29.009
 per week 

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:31.740
 I don't read them, I feel good 

00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:34.380
 physically i'm fine i don't think so 

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:38.130
 being 54 years old would seem to be one 

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:43.500
 just like that now I don't want to sing veil up 

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:47.909
 a weapon alone however it is clear that the idea 

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:52.229
 of the vegan vegetarian a little nerd 

00:01:47.909 --> 00:01:54.740
 mundo weak with no energy yes 

00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:58.649
 they drag because he made a choice 

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:59.159
 ideological philosophical ethics and so on 

00:01:58.649 --> 00:02:00.869
 etc 

00:01:59.159 --> 00:02:03.629
 I wish you are fees One moment 

00:02:00.869 --> 00:02:06.479
 because because there are instead of 

00:02:03.629 --> 00:02:09.360
 evidences not only for me 

00:02:06.479 --> 00:02:11.579
 but I know a lot of people even more 

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:14.489
 in the form of me feeding 

00:02:11.579 --> 00:02:16.920
 exclusively of plant foods and therefore 

00:02:14.489 --> 00:02:18.329
 I'm sure not that this kind of 

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:19.590
 power supply can only give gods 

00:02:18.329 --> 00:02:21.859
 advantages also from the point of view 

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:21.859
 energetic
