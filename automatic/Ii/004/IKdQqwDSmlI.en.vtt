fraps files a massive their massive
massive<00:02:05.310> file<00:02:05.610> so<00:02:05.820> you<00:02:05.909> need<00:02:06.060> a<00:02:06.090> lot<00:02:06.390> of<00:02:06.420> space

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:06.780 
massive file so you need a lot of space

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:08.600 
massive file so you need a lot of space
on<00:02:07.049> a<00:02:07.170> hard<00:02:07.439> drive<00:02:07.560> to<00:02:07.860> be<00:02:07.979> able<00:02:08.129> to<00:02:08.399> cope<00:02:08.580> with

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:11.210 
on a hard drive to be able to cope with
it<00:02:09.020> so<00:02:10.020> make<00:02:10.200> a<00:02:10.379> separate<00:02:10.770> file<00:02:10.950> for<00:02:11.129> that

00:02:11.210 --> 00:02:11.220

00:03:05.150 --> 00:03:05.160 
turned on so i can see when it's

00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:06.770

sort of thing to make everything is
running<00:03:08.190> smoothly<00:03:09.620> because<00:03:10.620> yeah<00:03:10.950> it<00:03:11.160> doesn't

00:03:11.300 --> 00:03:11.310 
running smoothly because yeah it doesn't

00:03:11.310 --> 00:03:15.100 
running smoothly because yeah it doesn't
show<00:03:11.520> up<00:03:11.550> in<00:03:11.640> the<00:03:11.760> recording<00:03:12.090> in<00:03:12.210> games<00:03:14.060> so

computers<00:04:14.160> not<00:04:14.370> so<00:04:14.550> great<00:04:14.790> it's<00:04:15.060> starting<00:04:15.390> to

00:04:15.440 --> 00:04:15.450 
computers not so great it's starting to

00:04:15.450 --> 00:04:18.010 
computers not so great it's starting to
lag<00:04:15.630> behind<00:04:15.660> a<00:04:16.020> bit<00:04:16.250> just<00:04:17.250> choose<00:04:17.459> half<00:04:17.670> size

00:04:18.010 --> 00:04:18.020 
lag behind a bit just choose half size

00:04:18.020 --> 00:04:20.180 
lag behind a bit just choose half size
quality<00:04:19.020> is<00:04:19.200> still<00:04:19.380> good<00:04:19.560> just<00:04:19.830> not<00:04:19.950> quite<00:04:20.130> as

00:04:20.180 --> 00:04:20.190 
quality is still good just not quite as

00:04:20.190 --> 00:04:24.230 
quality is still good just not quite as
hot<00:04:20.549> as<00:04:20.730> full<00:04:21.180> size<00:04:21.770> i'll<00:04:22.770> leave<00:04:22.950> that<00:04:23.240> record

00:04:24.230 --> 00:04:24.240 
hot as full size i'll leave that record

00:04:24.240 --> 00:04:26.360 
hot as full size i'll leave that record
with<00:04:24.360> the<00:04:24.450> seven<00:04:24.720> sound<00:04:24.960> i<00:04:25.140> have<00:04:25.260> it<00:04:25.380> checked

00:04:26.360 --> 00:04:26.370 
with the seven sound i have it checked

00:04:26.370 --> 00:04:29.900 
with the seven sound i have it checked
to<00:04:26.490> you<00:04:26.639> and<00:04:27.710> external<00:04:28.710> input<00:04:29.280> so<00:04:29.520> that's<00:04:29.669> just

00:04:29.900 --> 00:04:29.910 
to you and external input so that's just

00:04:29.910 --> 00:04:32.180 
to you and external input so that's just
too<00:04:30.000> Mike<00:04:30.180> I<00:04:30.570> don't<00:04:31.530> have<00:04:31.680> that<00:04:31.710> I<00:04:31.889> use<00:04:32.160> a

00:04:32.180 --> 00:04:32.190 
too Mike I don't have that I use a

00:04:32.190 --> 00:04:34.640 
too Mike I don't have that I use a
separate<00:04:32.580> software<00:04:32.850> for<00:04:33.210> that<00:04:33.360> so<00:04:33.630> again<00:04:34.440> it's

00:04:34.640 --> 00:04:34.650 
separate software for that so again it's

00:04:34.650 --> 00:04:38.120 
separate software for that so again it's
personal<00:04:35.040> preference<00:04:35.220> these<00:04:36.150> three<00:04:36.389> here<00:04:37.130> sig

00:04:38.120 --> 00:04:38.130

00:04:39.840 --> 00:04:42.379 
audio video dancing audio and video I
leave<00:04:40.290> that<00:04:40.410> unchecked<00:04:40.530> hide<00:04:41.010> mouse<00:04:41.250> now<00:04:41.550> but

00:04:42.379 --> 00:04:42.389 
leave that unchecked hide mouse now but

00:04:42.389 --> 00:04:45.379 
leave that unchecked hide mouse now but
I<00:04:42.720> guess<00:04:43.400> it<00:04:44.400> depends<00:04:44.760> on<00:04:44.940> the<00:04:45.030> game<00:04:45.180> I'm

00:04:45.379 --> 00:04:45.389 
I guess it depends on the game I'm

00:04:45.389 --> 00:04:48.200 
I guess it depends on the game I'm
playing<00:04:45.830> but<00:04:46.830> definitely<00:04:47.250> for<00:04:47.520> recording

00:04:48.200 --> 00:04:48.210

00:04:56.540 --> 00:04:56.550 
unchecked but for games and stuff it as

00:04:56.550 --> 00:04:58.280 
unchecked but for games and stuff it as
it<00:04:56.850> depends<00:04:57.240> on<00:04:57.300> the<00:04:57.360> game<00:04:57.540> sometimes<00:04:58.080> I<00:04:58.229> just

00:04:58.280 --> 00:04:58.290 
it depends on the game sometimes I just

00:04:58.290 --> 00:04:59.779 
it depends on the game sometimes I just
give<00:04:58.470> you<00:04:58.500> an<00:04:58.680> example<00:04:59.070> as<00:04:59.340> you<00:04:59.460> can<00:04:59.580> see<00:04:59.699> the

00:04:59.779 --> 00:04:59.789 
give you an example as you can see the

00:04:59.789 --> 00:05:02.240 
give you an example as you can see the

mouse is here click it and the mouse

00:05:02.250 --> 00:05:06.140 
mouse is here click it and the mouse
just<00:05:02.699> disappears<00:05:04.520> it<00:05:05.520> depends<00:05:05.850> on<00:05:05.910> the<00:05:06.000> game

00:05:06.140 --> 00:05:06.150 
just disappears it depends on the game

00:05:06.150 --> 00:05:07.790 
just disappears it depends on the game
sometimes<00:05:06.750> they<00:05:06.840> have<00:05:06.960> a<00:05:06.990> check<00:05:07.289> sometimes

00:05:07.790 --> 00:05:07.800 
sometimes they have a check sometimes

00:05:07.800 --> 00:05:10.969
