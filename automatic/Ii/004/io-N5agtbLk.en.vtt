00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:19.890

 consumption or a lifelong anti - dark circles 

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:30.720
 and we're going to apply ourselves a little bit for those 

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:32.580
 areas and those little imperfections I've 

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:35.430

00:00:32.580 --> 00:00:36.990
 pot to cover those reddish circles and 

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:38.970
 shits several that we are leaving in 

00:00:36.990 --> 00:00:41.579

00:00:38.970 --> 00:00:43.470
 an orc of mordor you think that with this 

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:45.420
 this is not enough not friend now 

00:00:43.470 --> 00:00:47.340
 you're going to take pot and you're going to 

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:49.710
 breathe well with a sponge with a 

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:51.300
 spatula or with a roller to remove 

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:53.850
 the effect I have put the scale in a 

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:56.580
 bag of risketos that very beautiful very 

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:58.440
 beautiful would not be the sheet and 

00:00:56.580 --> 00:00:59.940
 painting has only just begun 

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:02.940
 after casting all this power 

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:05.460
 to welcome a few powders the only powders 

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:08.070
 that you've been seeing for two years and you 

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:09.630
 you're going to throw all over your face and so for 

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:11.460
 seal the makeup well and for what 

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:14.189
 good to disguise as much as possible your 

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:16.890
 traits make no mistake 

00:01:14.189 --> 00:01:19.109
 look better now now that your face 

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:20.940
 starts to be the bullet test we are going to 

00:01:19.109 --> 00:01:23.610
 add a little rouge because 

00:01:20.940 --> 00:01:26.070
 kasper in a day with anemia 

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:27.810
 you're going to comb your eyebrows and you're going to 

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:29.850
 devote to filling them with a pencil 

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:32.040
 alpine or a road trim with what you have 

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:34.080
 by hand to cover those bald spots and their 

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:36.090
 bites of godzilla that you have and that 

00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:38.160
 you see a bushy eyebrow daenerys 

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:40.560
 targaryen an eyebrow to madonna of the 80 

00:01:38.160 --> 00:01:42.630
 one of last hawaii painting you 

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:45.270
 eyebrows no problem paints the other 

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:47.729
 just as bad and so will look like little sisters 

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:50.100
 twins now that you have the most eyebrows 

00:01:47.729 --> 00:01:52.050
 Ultra chic cool and fashion from the neighborhood you go 

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:54.030
 to catch a shadow of brown color and if 

00:01:52.050 --> 00:01:56.100
 friend say brown not pink fuchsia chewing gum 

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:58.470
 tacky you put on your eyes I've 

00:01:56.100 --> 00:02:00.050
 said brown and you're going to paint the basin 

00:01:58.470 --> 00:02:03.540
 of the eye to make it look like you have more 

00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:05.460
 deep in the eyes after 

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:07.229
 apply the brown shadow you're going to 

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:08.850
 blur so it does not look like you've 

00:02:07.229 --> 00:02:10.950
 been fighting for some panties of a 

00:02:08.850 --> 00:02:13.020
 euro at the corner market and 

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:14.790
 then you are going to take a shade of color 

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:16.560
 cream you are going to apply for all 

00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:18.090
 eyelid mobile to make it look like your 

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:21.950
 eyes shine with the light of 100,000 

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:21.950
 rainbow supercookies of death 

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:25.470
 i 

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:31.799
 after applying the shadow in cream color 

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:34.049
 you are going to apply a little bit of color 

00:02:31.799 --> 00:02:35.879
 brown a shade darker than the first 

00:02:34.049 --> 00:02:38.040
 that you had also put on the 

00:02:35.879 --> 00:02:39.959
 eye socket to give you that 3d effect 

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:42.269
 that effect 

00:02:39.959 --> 00:02:43.620
 makeup that we look for because if the 

00:02:42.269 --> 00:02:45.359
 makeup artist in a way there would not be 

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:47.400
 had a little compassion I would have 

00:02:45.359 --> 00:02:49.829
 made to the woman as some way of 

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:51.420
 lengthen the look would have put mascara on him 

00:02:49.829 --> 00:02:54.269
 I would have put eyeliner and I would not have 

00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:57.170
 left eyes like that with only two shadows 

00:02:54.269 --> 00:02:57.170
 and it is already 

00:02:57.300 --> 00:03:01.860
 to tell the truth or to the bullseye of the video 

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:03.720
 nor does it fit in our heads how it is 

00:03:01.860 --> 00:03:04.400
 It's possible that one area only carried this 

00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:06.630
 In the eyes 

00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:08.670
 later you will catch an illuminator 

00:03:06.630 --> 00:03:10.680
 in powder and you'll light up your face 

00:03:08.670 --> 00:03:12.570
 because you are a star illuminates the 

00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:16.230
 cheekbones illuminate the forehead 

00:03:12.570 --> 00:03:18.150
 illuminate everything that seems to have 

00:03:16.230 --> 00:03:21.340
 caught a bacon between the restinga or 

00:03:18.150 --> 00:03:23.370
 well for the face you're worth it babe 

00:03:21.340 --> 00:03:25.349
 Y 

00:03:23.370 --> 00:03:26.640
 remember that if you are going to recreate this 

00:03:25.349 --> 00:03:28.620
 makeup do not get too close to 

00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:30.000
 no secondary national highway 

00:03:28.620 --> 00:03:32.519
 because it can be that someone 

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:34.409
 dazzle and stick ostia now you're going to 

00:03:32.519 --> 00:03:35.909
 Take a pink blush and you will remove it 

00:03:34.409 --> 00:03:37.860
 the excess to the brush giving him some 

00:03:35.909 --> 00:03:39.989
 little touches remember this that if not 

00:03:37.860 --> 00:03:42.150
 then you go with that face you wear and ceo 

00:03:39.989 --> 00:03:44.280
 you are going to put it upwards is 

00:03:42.150 --> 00:03:46.319
 remember ascending please in the area 

00:03:44.280 --> 00:03:47.849
 of the cheekbone and not how you wear it 

00:03:46.319 --> 00:03:50.790
 you look like heidi after a session 

00:03:47.849 --> 00:03:52.530
 of scrub sex with Pedro after 

00:03:50.790 --> 00:03:54.900
 wipe out the rouge reserves of the 

00:03:52.530 --> 00:03:56.180
 English court you are going to proceed to take a 

00:03:54.900 --> 00:03:58.319
 Lip tone that does not stick 

00:03:56.180 --> 00:04:00.599
 absolutely nothing with the tone of your 

00:03:58.319 --> 00:04:02.519
 skin or naughty or anything that is as 

00:04:00.599 --> 00:04:04.290
 ugly you find at home and you're going 

00:04:02.519 --> 00:04:06.269
 to apply with a brush style 

00:04:04.290 --> 00:04:08.220
 torrubia is to say first you're going to 

00:04:06.269 --> 00:04:10.200
 outline the outside part and if you 

00:04:08.220 --> 00:04:12.120
 you feel creative and imaginative that day 

00:04:10.200 --> 00:04:13.620
 you can outline it even on the outside 

00:04:12.120 --> 00:04:15.720
 of the lip so it looks like you have 

00:04:13.620 --> 00:04:17.609
 some licks add-on you tilt and it's going to 

00:04:15.720 --> 00:04:20.310
 continue filling slowly so that 

00:04:17.609 --> 00:04:22.199
 look like I do not know a pretty thing a 

00:04:20.310 --> 00:04:24.320
 natural thing a beautiful thing a thing 

00:04:22.199 --> 00:04:27.210
 beautiful 

00:04:24.320 --> 00:04:30.000
 without filling lip it seems a pain in the ass 

00:04:27.210 --> 00:04:32.220
 of course you'll see that grace 

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:34.350
 what do you do when you run out of medium 

00:04:32.220 --> 00:04:36.450
 lipstick on the crystal of gin tonic 

00:04:34.350 --> 00:04:39.030
 that you're going to take 20 minutes of 

00:04:36.450 --> 00:04:41.130
 have left home and that is my advice 

00:04:39.030 --> 00:04:43.770
 today's friend if you're going to use your mouth 

00:04:41.130 --> 00:04:46.110
 to eat drink or anything that is 

00:04:43.770 --> 00:04:48.360
 happen to you remember that it's much better 

00:04:46.110 --> 00:04:50.580
 wear eye makeup to wear 

00:04:48.360 --> 00:04:52.440
 the lips very painted because right away 

00:04:50.580 --> 00:04:54.450
 lipstick falls must be 

00:04:52.440 --> 00:04:56.810
 retouching it constantly and it's a 

00:04:54.450 --> 00:04:56.810
 cognac 

00:04:57.620 --> 00:05:02.270
 to 

00:04:59.870 --> 00:05:04.760
 and now you only need to take the 

00:05:02.270 --> 00:05:06.350
 pieces and show off your look uma thurman 

00:05:04.760 --> 00:05:08.990
 when everyone believed that he had 

00:05:06.350 --> 00:05:11.630
 operated the truth is that it has to be said 

00:05:08.990 --> 00:05:13.790
 that being a brunette is better than 

00:05:11.630 --> 00:05:16.450
 to her which was not a very challenging 

00:05:13.790 --> 00:05:19.040
 hard to get 

00:05:16.450 --> 00:05:20.660
 -there are friends I hope others and that 

00:05:19.040 --> 00:05:22.640
 you are the best of these bars 

00:05:20.660 --> 00:05:24.920
 lips in dark tones like plum 

00:05:22.640 --> 00:05:26.690
 violet brown is that they make your 

00:05:24.920 --> 00:05:29.270
 teeth look much more yellow than 

00:05:26.690 --> 00:05:30.920
 what they really are and surely 

00:05:29.270 --> 00:05:33.020
 you will not want this effect I will summon you 

00:05:30.920 --> 00:05:37.070
 that you remove that color you put a 

00:05:33.020 --> 00:05:39.920
 tone as well as newton rosita something more 

00:05:37.070 --> 00:05:43.010
 discreet you do this dye is the line 

00:05:39.920 --> 00:05:44.810
 with an eyeliner or with a pencil with 

00:05:43.010 --> 00:05:47.030
 you want and put on some mascara 

00:05:44.810 --> 00:05:50.380
 that is always more natural more beautiful 

00:05:47.030 --> 00:05:50.380
 and more wearable on the street 

00:05:53.060 --> 00:05:57.750
 do not spend too much in the corner 

00:05:55.500 --> 00:06:01.580
 of the eyeliner unless you like it very much 

00:05:57.750 --> 00:06:01.580
 the vodka and you call amy winehouse 

00:06:01.960 --> 00:06:06.729
 the best way to load the lashes 

00:06:04.030 --> 00:06:08.949
 without getting layers and layers of mascara is 

00:06:06.729 --> 00:06:11.620
 starting from the root to the tips 

00:06:08.949 --> 00:06:13.030
 in zig zag movement remember this 

00:06:11.620 --> 00:06:16.419
 trick every time you go to paint 

00:06:13.030 --> 00:06:18.669
 fabrics and lips please try that 

00:06:16.419 --> 00:06:23.190
 they seem something a natural and that has not 

00:06:18.669 --> 00:06:23.190
 skipped from sucking ice cream 

00:06:26.240 --> 00:06:30.020

00:06:27.919 --> 00:06:31.970

00:06:30.020 --> 00:06:34.400
 like you can subscribe what you can 

00:06:31.970 --> 00:06:35.990
