been trying to tweak it in bits and
pieces<00:00:22.170> to<00:00:22.289> see<00:00:22.439> if<00:00:22.529> it<00:00:22.619> works<00:00:22.830> and<00:00:23.130> what<00:00:23.310> not

00:00:23.509 --> 00:00:23.519 
pieces to see if it works and what not

00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:25.970 
pieces to see if it works and what not
and<00:00:23.730> on<00:00:24.570> the<00:00:24.689> whole<00:00:24.779> it<00:00:25.050> does<00:00:25.260> so<00:00:25.470> here<00:00:25.650> we<00:00:25.800> are

00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:25.980 
and on the whole it does so here we are

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:29.689 
and on the whole it does so here we are
now<00:00:26.730> as<00:00:27.529> with<00:00:28.529> the<00:00:28.560> case<00:00:28.830> with<00:00:28.980> new<00:00:29.099> passes<00:00:29.490> i<00:00:29.640> 2

00:00:29.689 --> 00:00:29.699 
now as with the case with new passes i 2

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:31.640 
now as with the case with new passes i 2
i'm<00:00:30.240> finding<00:00:30.720> out<00:00:30.779> how<00:00:30.990> to<00:00:31.050> get<00:00:31.349> this<00:00:31.470> to<00:00:31.619> work

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:31.650 
i'm finding out how to get this to work

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:35.120 
i'm finding out how to get this to work
to<00:00:32.160> its<00:00:32.309> best<00:00:32.579> to<00:00:32.850> its<00:00:32.940> potential<00:00:33.469> so<00:00:34.469> the

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:35.130 
to its best to its potential so the

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:37.970 
to its best to its potential so the
occasional<00:00:35.969> mistakes<00:00:36.360> this<00:00:36.660> should<00:00:37.079> be<00:00:37.260> there

00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:37.980 
occasional mistakes this should be there

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:40.130 
occasional mistakes this should be there
when<00:00:38.250> there<00:00:38.370> isn't<00:00:38.700> blah<00:00:38.940> blah<00:00:39.239> blah<00:00:39.270> and<00:00:39.840> will

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:29.539 
want to lower the bass power more simply
simple<00:01:27.210> as<00:01:27.360> that<00:01:27.390> and<00:01:27.829> the<00:01:28.829> sp1<00:01:29.100> comes<00:01:29.280> out<00:01:29.430> and

00:01:29.539 --> 00:01:29.549 
simple as that and the sp1 comes out and

00:01:29.549 --> 00:01:31.880 
simple as that and the sp1 comes out and
because<00:01:29.820> i<00:01:29.909> saw<00:01:30.090> the<00:01:30.150> right<00:01:30.390> to<00:01:30.600> die<00:01:30.960> and<00:01:31.290> the

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:34.350 
SP on doesn't have much better defenses

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:36.080 
SP on doesn't have much better defenses
I<00:01:34.530> think<00:01:34.740> it's<00:01:34.829> a<00:01:34.860> base<00:01:35.009> 95<00:01:35.579> in<00:01:35.759> special

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:36.090 
I think it's a base 95 in special

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:39.469 
I think it's a base 95 in special
defense<00:01:36.360> and<00:01:36.659> they<00:01:37.259> 65<00:01:37.979> in<00:01:38.189> health<00:01:38.479> I'm

00:01:39.469 --> 00:01:39.479 
defense and they 65 in health I'm

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:40.999 
defense and they 65 in health I'm
thinking<00:01:39.900> I<00:01:39.960> can<00:01:40.110> take<00:01:40.259> it<00:01:40.290> down<00:01:40.409> as<00:01:40.680> well<00:01:40.799> so<00:01:40.979> I

00:01:40.999 --> 00:01:41.009 
thinking I can take it down as well so I

00:01:41.009 --> 00:01:43.370 
thinking I can take it down as well so I
use<00:01:41.159> hydro<00:01:41.460> pump<00:01:41.490> again<00:01:41.909> I<00:01:42.090> think<00:01:42.930> I<00:01:42.960> do<00:01:43.020> decide

00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:43.380 
use hydro pump again I think I do decide

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:45.050 
use hydro pump again I think I do decide
to<00:01:43.560> talk<00:01:43.860> to<00:01:44.009> the<00:01:44.100> typhlosion<00:01:44.670> this<00:01:44.820> turn

00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:45.060 
to talk to the typhlosion this turn

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:46.969 
to talk to the typhlosion this turn
which<00:01:45.299> may<00:01:46.020> have<00:01:46.350> not<00:01:46.680> been<00:01:46.710> the<00:01:46.890> best

00:01:46.969 --> 00:01:46.979 
which may have not been the best

00:01:46.979 --> 00:01:48.859 
which may have not been the best
decision<00:01:47.159> well<00:01:47.520> boy<00:01:47.759> will<00:01:47.970> says<00:01:48.240> is<00:01:48.540> that<00:01:48.600> the

00:01:48.859 --> 00:01:48.869 
decision well boy will says is that the

00:01:48.869 --> 00:01:50.539 
decision well boy will says is that the
Brick<00:01:49.170> Break<00:01:49.200> that's<00:01:49.860> on<00:01:50.009> that<00:01:50.220> leave<00:01:50.460> the

Brick Break that's on that leave the
colo<00:01:50.790> is<00:01:51.090> probably<00:01:51.750> get<00:01:51.990> changed<00:01:52.530> because<00:01:52.740> a

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:52.860 
colo is probably get changed because a

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:54.230 
colo is probably get changed because a
tight<00:01:53.130> coverage<00:01:53.460> like<00:01:53.670> I<00:01:53.700> thought<00:01:53.939> it<00:01:54.090> would

00:01:54.230 --> 00:01:54.240 
tight coverage like I thought it would

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:56.569 
tight coverage like I thought it would
bring<00:01:54.420> is<00:01:54.720> not<00:01:54.960> as<00:01:55.079> useful<00:01:55.259> as<00:01:55.470> I'd<00:01:55.649> hoped<00:01:55.829> not

00:01:56.569 --> 00:01:56.579 
bring is not as useful as I'd hoped not

00:01:56.579 --> 00:01:58.399 
bring is not as useful as I'd hoped not
sure<00:01:56.759> what<00:01:56.880> i'll<00:01:56.969> change<00:01:57.180> it<00:01:57.329> to<00:01:57.390> yet<00:01:57.780> we'll

00:01:58.399 --> 00:01:58.409 
sure what i'll change it to yet we'll

00:01:58.409 --> 00:02:01.280 
sure what i'll change it to yet we'll
see<00:01:59.090> but<00:02:00.090> you<00:02:00.360> know<00:02:00.450> it's<00:02:00.600> kids<00:02:00.869> quite<00:02:01.079> beefy

that one really no toques is taller so

00:02:03.479 --> 00:02:05.690 
that one really no toques is taller so
it<00:02:03.570> takes<00:02:03.780> the<00:02:04.020> flame<00:02:04.350> phone<00:02:04.740> with<00:02:05.549> ease

00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:05.700 
it takes the flame phone with ease

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:07.190 
it takes the flame phone with ease

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:12.480 
done that typhlosion this used to hit

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:13.760 
done that typhlosion this used to hit
quite<00:02:12.690> hard<00:02:12.989> even<00:02:13.200> in<00:02:13.410> the<00:02:13.500> very

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:13.770 
quite hard even in the very

00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:15.300
