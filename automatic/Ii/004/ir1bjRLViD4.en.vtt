00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.770
 hey my dear i have a little bit 

00:00:02.610 --> 00:00:06.629
 make-up or beauty products too 

00:00:04.770 --> 00:00:08.490
 sorted out because I just too much 

00:00:06.629 --> 00:00:10.590
 many have and there I am 

00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:12.120
 once for the worst products 

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:13.679
 decided I have now once 

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:17.030
 I would like to paint them and I want them now 

00:00:13.679 --> 00:00:17.030
 once show a lot of fun 

00:00:23.690 --> 00:00:27.950
 let's start with a nail polish 

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:29.200
 I bought that is from 

00:00:27.950 --> 00:00:32.270
 Manhattan 

00:00:29.200 --> 00:00:33.890
 and I bought a brand new one 

00:00:32.270 --> 00:00:35.450
 applied the bucket immediately 

00:00:33.890 --> 00:00:40.280
 I did it again because I like the color 

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:41.660
 just so ugly I found so can 

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:47.030
 do not express it 

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:50.360
 it is the number 61 v it is such a 

00:00:47.030 --> 00:00:52.460
 it says here with lotus extract 

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:54.260
 Blablabla, in any case, I thought so 

00:00:52.460 --> 00:00:57.260
 would be a totally beautiful purple and 

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:57.800
 came out is a totally dirty 

00:00:57.260 --> 00:00:59.269
 low 

00:00:57.800 --> 00:01:01.010
 So that really is not nice 

00:00:59.269 --> 00:01:02.360
 if you can nail it on the nails 

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:03.589
 I really do not recommend you and 

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:06.080
 that comes right back into the box right now 

00:01:03.589 --> 00:01:08.270
 garbage unfortunately then it goes with two 

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:09.979
 continue counting I have sorted out 

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:11.990
 maybe you will wonder 

00:01:09.979 --> 00:01:17.240
 is once the concealer of garnier 

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:19.310
 rollon this is a concealer that is 

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:21.650
 do not take this is one of 

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:23.870
 the older dimension 

00:01:21.650 --> 00:01:27.470
 but this concealer unfortunately has me 

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:31.130
 it does not like it at all 

00:01:27.470 --> 00:01:34.220
 really not been nice when I was 

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:35.810
 him me on the on my dark circles 

00:01:34.220 --> 00:01:38.120
 the skin has stopped it has the 

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:41.180
 Skin totally dried out and you have 

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:43.580
 really every single skin rash 

00:01:41.180 --> 00:01:45.940
 seen and needs to express that way though 

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:47.990
 you really have every one but 

00:01:45.940 --> 00:01:49.940
 seen skin particles and it has like that 

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:51.440
 dried out that was not at all 

00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:52.730
 Well, maybe I'll find her contracted 

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:55.850
 the better but I have it at all 

00:01:52.730 --> 00:01:58.010
 not tolerate and then still 

00:01:55.850 --> 00:02:00.440
 once a concealer from manhattan 

00:01:58.010 --> 00:02:02.770
 I have made it in the beginning and totally 

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:04.910
 loved this is the wake up concealer 

00:02:02.770 --> 00:02:06.500
 and I have my even after 

00:02:04.910 --> 00:02:08.629
 So that's the second one I bought 

00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:10.280
 But now I have others 

00:02:08.629 --> 00:02:12.680
 Concealer tested for example the 

00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:16.700
 manhattan pitney not manhattan 

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:18.739
 by mail berlin and in contrast to 

00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:20.780
 this concealer covers the others 

00:02:18.739 --> 00:02:23.060
 concealer no matter what you have you too 

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:25.790
 camouflage has or what else that covers 

00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:27.650
 Everything was great and this concealer totally 

00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:29.330
 bad so there I really needed 

00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:30.800
 also no concealer open there 

00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:31.620
 do you actually have the same result 

00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:35.159
 that's just it 

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:37.200
 you performed well with it then what covers 

00:02:35.159 --> 00:02:38.519
 it goes on with two brushes I 

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:41.849
 bought me 

00:02:38.519 --> 00:02:43.560
 once this is the brush of the berlin 

00:02:41.849 --> 00:02:46.950
 I already had in my isle of drugs 

00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:49.049
 shown to make up video and this 

00:02:46.950 --> 00:02:50.310
 I bought brush because I am 

00:02:49.049 --> 00:02:53.549
 bought a palette 

00:02:50.310 --> 00:02:55.620
 lipgloss are in it and this brush is 

00:02:53.549 --> 00:02:56.849
 The worst brush I ever had 

00:02:55.620 --> 00:03:00.890
 have seen 

00:02:56.849 --> 00:03:00.890
 I'll try to show it to you 

00:03:02.239 --> 00:03:06.750
 So you have realized that he is total 

00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:09.540
 Stuck out of this brush 

00:03:06.750 --> 00:03:12.209
 I do not know what just invented there 

00:03:09.540 --> 00:03:14.370
 or is it such a bad one? 

00:03:12.209 --> 00:03:16.079
 product is what I have unfortunately caught 

00:03:14.370 --> 00:03:18.720
 and the others are all good 

00:03:16.079 --> 00:03:19.859
 this pensel has extremely i have mine 

00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:21.569
 also made the lips and I had 

00:03:19.859 --> 00:03:23.670
 really just hair in my loveless 

00:03:21.569 --> 00:03:26.010
 smeared that did not work 

00:03:23.670 --> 00:03:30.230
 and you can not do that properly 

00:03:26.010 --> 00:03:30.230
 wear because the brush is totally total 

00:03:30.680 --> 00:03:34.440
 stupid is the form he is at all 

00:03:32.940 --> 00:03:35.940
 not even you can do that at all 

00:03:34.440 --> 00:03:39.180
 do not apply on the lips so 

00:03:35.940 --> 00:03:40.769
 unfortunately a real flop product and 

00:03:39.180 --> 00:03:44.310
 then I had bought a brush 

00:03:40.769 --> 00:03:46.440
 they always exist at budnikowsky and 

00:03:44.310 --> 00:03:48.690
 Unfortunately, I do not know which brand 

00:03:46.440 --> 00:03:50.790
 brush it is unfortunately not on it 

00:03:48.690 --> 00:03:53.129
 but the format is like that too 

00:03:50.790 --> 00:03:54.959
 buy so closed first so 

00:03:53.129 --> 00:03:56.700
 perfect for take away for 

00:03:54.959 --> 00:03:59.160
 on the way and you can do it then 

00:03:56.700 --> 00:04:01.049
 Open up and here you would have one 

00:03:59.160 --> 00:04:03.209
 super square brush 

00:04:01.049 --> 00:04:04.169
 but unfortunately this brush at all 

00:04:03.209 --> 00:04:05.849
 not good for 1 

00:04:04.169 --> 00:04:07.980
 you see it now again so he 

00:04:05.849 --> 00:04:10.410
 has extremely again this brush 

00:04:07.980 --> 00:04:12.870
 that does not work at all and then you have 

00:04:10.410 --> 00:04:14.849
 her also a much too snow brush around 

00:04:12.870 --> 00:04:16.530
 So I find it to apply 

00:04:14.849 --> 00:04:19.109
 does not work right you have 

00:04:16.530 --> 00:04:21.150
 So then he can be doctors for 

00:04:19.109 --> 00:04:23.190
 marry or use but not to 

00:04:21.150 --> 00:04:25.949
 Pleasure on wearing but also that 

00:04:23.190 --> 00:04:28.530
 the highlight is just not good then 

00:04:25.949 --> 00:04:31.680
 I have two eyebrow products and 

00:04:28.530 --> 00:04:33.580
 Although this is the eyebrows go once 

00:04:31.680 --> 00:04:36.710
 from Alba 

00:04:33.580 --> 00:04:39.320
 So really bad so tired of me 

00:04:36.710 --> 00:04:41.810
 but I found the idea stop first 

00:04:39.320 --> 00:04:44.600
 totally cool you have something to do here 

00:04:41.810 --> 00:04:47.539
 open up and you can then yours 

00:04:44.600 --> 00:04:49.400
 comb through eyebrows a bit and 

00:04:47.539 --> 00:04:51.949
 then if you did that you can 

00:04:49.400 --> 00:04:53.509
 open this once and then have 

00:04:51.949 --> 00:04:55.910
 one more thing to do with it 

00:04:53.509 --> 00:04:59.360
 the problem is simple i came with that 

00:04:55.910 --> 00:05:01.870
 gel not so that's ge yes 

00:04:59.360 --> 00:05:05.150
 even with color in it for extra 

00:05:01.870 --> 00:05:07.610
 brown-haired and if I'm that 

00:05:05.150 --> 00:05:09.500
 It has been done on the eyebrows 

00:05:07.610 --> 00:05:11.810
 worked that means I really had 

00:05:09.500 --> 00:05:14.060
 partly a lump here in front 

00:05:11.810 --> 00:05:16.789
 had to then that is smeared and 

00:05:14.060 --> 00:05:19.000
 then it was totally and really out so you 

00:05:16.789 --> 00:05:21.650
 eyebrows should rather a little bit 

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:22.940
 Trace a little less if you 

00:05:21.650 --> 00:05:26.380
 understand what I mean 

00:05:22.940 --> 00:05:28.970
 but since I really have a brown layer 

00:05:26.380 --> 00:05:31.460
 had color on your eyebrows that 

00:05:28.970 --> 00:05:32.660
 was totally unnatural and above all 

00:05:31.460 --> 00:05:34.340
 Did not you do that well ? 

00:05:32.660 --> 00:05:36.310
 if it comes after three 

00:05:34.340 --> 00:05:38.510
 about the second has already dried 

00:05:36.310 --> 00:05:40.490
 then I have a slip once 

00:05:38.510 --> 00:05:41.479
 sorted out that is the wish of 

00:05:40.490 --> 00:05:48.849
 Manhattan 

00:05:41.479 --> 00:05:50.240
 That's what he looks like and he is 

00:05:48.849 --> 00:05:52.760
 bad 

00:05:50.240 --> 00:05:54.500
 I used it for a long time , I thought so 

00:05:52.760 --> 00:05:56.090
 always human, I give the foot but one 

00:05:54.500 --> 00:05:57.770
 I will let them chance someday 

00:05:56.090 --> 00:06:00.229
 be good but it does not have 

00:05:57.770 --> 00:06:03.050
 Does it really dry so it works 

00:06:00.229 --> 00:06:05.000
 is a dry mass and it works 

00:06:03.050 --> 00:06:06.770
 just not to apply properly so 

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:07.250
 first too dry to apply it 

00:06:06.770 --> 00:06:09.530
 can 

00:06:07.250 --> 00:06:12.110
 and then you stand here holding the whole 

00:06:09.530 --> 00:06:14.210
 time and I think the color is too 

00:06:12.110 --> 00:06:16.639
 maybe it's dark on me 

00:06:14.210 --> 00:06:19.130
 the color was selected wrong but it 

00:06:16.639 --> 00:06:20.659
 just does not fit and leaves me 

00:06:19.130 --> 00:06:23.030
 Also really not nice to 

00:06:20.659 --> 00:06:24.530
 wear so there are really better 

00:06:23.030 --> 00:06:26.930
 things and therefore are here I go 

00:06:24.530 --> 00:06:29.510
 In any case, then I sort 

00:06:26.930 --> 00:06:33.260
 as well an eyeshadow of manhattan 

00:06:29.510 --> 00:06:35.659
 That's what this one has here 

00:06:33.260 --> 00:06:39.270
 different colors on the back 

00:06:35.659 --> 00:06:41.310
 back stands once 95 c 96 km and 5 

00:06:39.270 --> 00:06:44.010
 Only maybe you can do something with it 

00:06:41.310 --> 00:06:46.200
 so i can not do it but it does 

00:06:44.010 --> 00:06:48.630
 is definitely when you are 

00:06:46.200 --> 00:06:51.510
 this is what a nice mix looks like 

00:06:48.630 --> 00:06:54.180
 natural nude and shades of brown and b 

00:06:51.510 --> 00:06:56.040
 So that's what you actually feel 

00:06:54.180 --> 00:06:58.830
 Dwindles used for everyday life and 

00:06:56.040 --> 00:07:00.360
 unfortunately they do not hide at all 

00:06:58.830 --> 00:07:03.420
 and I think they do not fit well either 

00:07:00.360 --> 00:07:05.460
 Together they are cold colors and me 

00:07:03.420 --> 00:07:07.470
 do not like to drive cold and there 

00:07:05.460 --> 00:07:09.030
 There are simply better eyeshadows that 

00:07:07.470 --> 00:07:10.860
 I also have with me than that now 

00:07:09.030 --> 00:07:12.330
 Manhattan would have to keep and 

00:07:10.860 --> 00:07:14.700
 which is already somehow anyway 

00:07:12.330 --> 00:07:17.490
 I think good half a year or one 

00:07:14.700 --> 00:07:19.950
 year in my game I am assorting 

00:07:17.490 --> 00:07:21.900
 use is just never so he comes 

00:07:19.950 --> 00:07:24.510
 now gone because he's actually good at that 

00:07:21.900 --> 00:07:25.650
 was pigmented and fit the other 

00:07:24.510 --> 00:07:26.940
 the colors are not really nice 

00:07:25.650 --> 00:07:27.930
 together and then it really cold 

00:07:26.940 --> 00:07:30.120
 colors have been 

00:07:27.930 --> 00:07:31.620
 yes my dear that was it already 

00:07:30.120 --> 00:07:33.240
 I could not do that anymore 

00:07:31.620 --> 00:07:35.700
 but maybe it will come soon 

00:07:33.240 --> 00:07:37.830
 because I always forge new buying 

00:07:35.700 --> 00:07:39.000
 and that always gets full of me and that 

00:07:37.830 --> 00:07:39.660
 everything does not fit in anymore 

00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:42.030
 bathroom 

00:07:39.660 --> 00:07:43.830
 I definitely hope we can 

00:07:42.030 --> 00:07:45.810
 unhelpful for you maybe 

00:07:43.830 --> 00:07:48.060
 Do you know now what we products you 

00:07:45.810 --> 00:07:50.130
 better not to buy or synonymous 

00:07:48.060 --> 00:07:51.510
 maybe we should buy each other 

00:07:50.130 --> 00:07:54.410
 In any case, at the next video 

00:07:51.510 --> 00:07:54.410
 again and until then
