here<00:00:22.850> see<00:00:23.850> that<00:00:25.640> and<00:00:26.640> then<00:00:26.820> I've<00:00:26.939> got<00:00:27.150> the<00:00:27.359> main

00:00:28.189 --> 00:00:28.199 
here see that and then I've got the main

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:30.769 
here see that and then I've got the main
power<00:00:28.500> wires<00:00:28.939> running<00:00:29.939> from<00:00:30.060> the<00:00:30.300> fuse<00:00:30.570> box

00:00:30.769 --> 00:00:30.779 
power wires running from the fuse box

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:33.680 
power wires running from the fuse box
into<00:00:31.349> the<00:00:31.500> distribution<00:00:32.040> block<00:00:32.579> and<00:00:33.480> then

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:33.690 
into the distribution block and then

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:37.040 
into the distribution block and then
from<00:00:34.079> the<00:00:34.829> alternator<00:00:35.610> to<00:00:36.210> the<00:00:36.360> distribution

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:37.050 
from the alternator to the distribution

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:39.020 
from the alternator to the distribution
block<00:00:37.230> and<00:00:37.770> then<00:00:37.890> the<00:00:37.980> last<00:00:38.160> one<00:00:38.430> the<00:00:38.579> starter

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:39.030

block and then the last one the starter
to<00:00:39.270> the<00:00:39.300> distribution<00:00:39.989> box<00:00:40.579> and<00:00:41.579> then<00:00:41.730> uh<00:00:43.129> I'll

00:00:44.119 --> 00:00:44.129 
to the distribution box and then uh I'll

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:58.029 
to the distribution box and then uh I'll
show<00:00:44.309> you<00:00:44.399> guys<00:00:44.579> the<00:00:44.640> where<00:00:45.329> I<00:00:45.360> put<00:00:45.570> battery<00:00:45.899> I

alternator to the distribution block and
my<00:02:15.600> volts<00:02:15.900> were<00:02:16.050> still<00:02:16.350> dropping<00:02:16.620> pretty<00:02:16.950> bad
