coming<00:04:11.530> down<00:04:11.739> the<00:04:11.980> hallway<00:04:12.190> here<00:04:13.890> this<00:04:14.890> is<00:04:15.190> the

00:04:15.510 --> 00:04:15.520 
coming down the hallway here this is the

00:04:15.520 --> 00:04:18.720 
coming down the hallway here this is the
second<00:04:16.389> bedroom<00:04:16.630> or<00:04:17.139> the<00:04:17.200> guest<00:04:17.410> bedroom<00:04:18.250> it's

00:04:18.720 --> 00:04:18.730 
second bedroom or the guest bedroom it's

00:04:18.730 --> 00:04:20.819 
second bedroom or the guest bedroom it's
a<00:04:18.850> little<00:04:19.120> on<00:04:19.269> the<00:04:19.450> small<00:04:19.780> side<00:04:20.169> but<00:04:20.200> it's<00:04:20.590> very

00:04:20.819 --> 00:04:20.829 
a little on the small side but it's very

00:04:20.829 --> 00:04:22.560 
a little on the small side but it's very
cozy<00:04:21.160> and<00:04:21.370> comfortable<00:04:21.730> I<00:04:22.060> think<00:04:22.090> this<00:04:22.450> is

00:04:22.560 --> 00:04:22.570 
cozy and comfortable I think this is

00:04:22.570 --> 00:04:25.760 
cozy and comfortable I think this is
probably<00:04:22.780> a<00:04:23.020> queen<00:04:23.290> bed<00:04:23.850> and<00:04:24.850> there's<00:04:25.419> your

00:04:25.760 --> 00:04:25.770 
probably a queen bed and there's your

00:04:25.770 --> 00:04:29.310 
probably a queen bed and there's your
nice<00:04:26.770> closet<00:04:27.490> for<00:04:27.790> keeping<00:04:28.480> your<00:04:28.600> clothes<00:04:28.900> and

00:04:29.310 --> 00:04:29.320 
nice closet for keeping your clothes and

00:04:29.320 --> 00:04:32.670 
nice closet for keeping your clothes and
shoes<00:04:29.560> and<00:04:29.620> things<00:04:30.160> and<00:04:30.660> another<00:04:31.660> very<00:04:32.440> nice

00:04:32.670 --> 00:04:32.680 
shoes and things and another very nice

00:04:32.680 --> 00:04:35.520 
shoes and things and another very nice
wall-mounted<00:04:33.580> flat<00:04:33.970> screen<00:04:34.360> television<00:04:35.139> set

00:04:35.520 --> 00:04:35.530 
wall-mounted flat screen television set

00:04:35.530 --> 00:04:37.650 
wall-mounted flat screen television set
so<00:04:36.280> I<00:04:36.310> think<00:04:36.430> it<00:04:36.700> has<00:04:36.880> just<00:04:36.910> about<00:04:37.270> everything

00:04:37.650 --> 00:04:37.660 
so I think it has just about everything

00:04:37.660 --> 00:04:41.940 
so I think it has just about everything
you<00:04:38.410> would<00:04:38.620> need<00:04:38.860> and<00:04:39.720> the<00:04:40.720> bathroom<00:04:41.530> is<00:04:41.770> in

00:04:41.940 --> 00:04:41.950 
you would need and the bathroom is in

00:04:41.950 --> 00:04:44.070 
you would need and the bathroom is in
the<00:04:41.979> hallway<00:04:42.639> which<00:04:43.240> of<00:04:43.389> course<00:04:43.419> makes<00:04:43.810> it

00:04:44.070 --> 00:04:44.080 
the hallway which of course makes it

00:04:44.080 --> 00:04:46.620 
the hallway which of course makes it
accessible<00:04:44.530> also<00:04:45.040> to<00:04:45.310> people<00:04:46.120> who<00:04:46.419> might<00:04:46.600> be

00:04:46.620 --> 00:04:46.630 
accessible also to people who might be

00:04:46.630 --> 00:04:48.330 
accessible also to people who might be
sleeping<00:04:47.139> in<00:04:47.260> the<00:04:47.350> living<00:04:47.680> room<00:04:47.889> this

00:04:48.330 --> 00:04:48.340 
sleeping in the living room this

00:04:48.340 --> 00:04:50.070 
sleeping in the living room this
bathroom<00:04:48.880> is<00:04:48.970> huge<00:04:49.300> I<00:04:49.660> think<00:04:49.840> you<00:04:49.900> could

00:04:50.070 --> 00:04:50.080 
bathroom is huge I think you could

00:04:50.080 --> 00:04:53.010 
bathroom is huge I think you could
probably<00:04:50.169> put<00:04:50.530> a<00:04:50.560> bed<00:04:50.860> in<00:04:50.889> here<00:04:51.430> but<00:04:52.090> you<00:04:52.840> have

00:04:53.010 --> 00:04:53.020 
probably put a bed in here but you have

00:04:53.020 --> 00:04:57.450 
probably put a bed in here but you have
