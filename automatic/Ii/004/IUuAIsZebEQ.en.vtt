and then you're going to go about an
inch<00:01:01.150> from<00:01:02.150> that<00:01:02.420> bed<00:01:02.660> and<00:01:03.050> make<00:01:03.350> another<00:01:03.730> Bend

00:01:04.720 --> 00:01:04.730 
inch from that bed and make another Bend

00:01:04.730 --> 00:01:10.660 
inch from that bed and make another Bend
straight<00:01:05.540> up

00:01:10.660 --> 00:01:10.670 

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:13.149 

and<00:01:10.820> then<00:01:11.390> curve<00:01:11.720> the<00:01:11.900> water<00:01:12.140> back<00:01:12.439> towards

00:01:13.149 --> 00:01:13.159 
and then curve the water back towards

00:01:13.159 --> 00:01:17.380 
and then curve the water back towards
the<00:01:13.430> first<00:01:14.150> Bend<00:01:15.430> so<00:01:16.430> you<00:01:16.640> have<00:01:16.970> a<00:01:17.000> piece<00:01:17.360> that

00:01:17.380 --> 00:01:17.390 
the first Bend so you have a piece that

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:20.620 
the first Bend so you have a piece that
kind<00:01:17.869> of<00:01:17.960> looks<00:01:18.200> like<00:01:18.350> this<00:01:19.270> and<00:01:20.270> then<00:01:20.420> you're

00:01:20.620 --> 00:01:20.630 
kind of looks like this and then you're

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:23.920 
kind of looks like this and then you're
going<00:01:20.720> to<00:01:20.780> take<00:01:20.869> your<00:01:22.119> water<00:01:23.119> and<00:01:23.420> bend<00:01:23.720> it<00:01:23.810> a

going to take your water and bend it a
third<00:01:24.170> time<00:01:24.850> so<00:01:25.850> you've<00:01:26.119> got<00:01:26.360> the<00:01:27.229> down

00:01:27.430 --> 00:01:27.440 
third time so you've got the down

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:29.680 
third time so you've got the down
portion<00:01:27.950> of<00:01:28.039> your<00:01:28.130> cuz<00:01:28.340> you've<00:01:28.580> got<00:01:28.759> the<00:01:28.880> top

00:01:31.690 --> 00:01:31.700 
portion and then this portion back here

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:33.550 
portion and then this portion back here
is<00:01:31.789> going<00:01:31.909> to<00:01:32.000> be<00:01:32.119> the<00:01:32.330> part<00:01:33.049> that<00:01:33.229> wraps

00:01:33.550 --> 00:01:33.560 
is going to be the part that wraps

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:37.810 
is going to be the part that wraps
around<00:01:33.890> your<00:01:34.369> ear<00:01:34.580> and<00:01:36.369> then<00:01:37.369> I'm<00:01:37.610> going<00:01:37.789> to

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:49.719 

I'm<00:01:47.689> just<00:01:47.810> going<00:01:47.990> to<00:01:48.049> coil<00:01:48.380> the<00:01:48.500> wire<00:01:48.619> if<00:01:49.490> you

00:01:49.719 --> 00:01:49.729 
I'm just going to coil the wire if you
