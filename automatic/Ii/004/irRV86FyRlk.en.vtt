00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:04.340 
gain and nothing to lose and that
mentality<00:01:03.000> and<00:01:03.449> that's<00:01:03.690> the<00:01:03.840> right<00:01:03.989> mentality

00:01:04.340 --> 00:01:04.350 
mentality and that's the right mentality

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:06.260 
mentality and that's the right mentality
because<00:01:04.890> you<00:01:05.010> do<00:01:05.189> fight<00:01:05.489> the<00:01:06.030> best

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:06.270 
because you do fight the best

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:07.880 
because you do fight the best
pound-for-pound<00:01:06.630> fighter<00:01:07.229> in<00:01:07.320> the<00:01:07.530> world<00:01:07.680> so

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:07.890 
pound-for-pound fighter in the world so

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:09.350 
pound-for-pound fighter in the world so
you<00:01:07.979> have<00:01:08.130> everything<00:01:08.400> to<00:01:08.729> gain<00:01:08.880> and<00:01:09.119> if<00:01:09.210> you

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:09.360 
you have everything to gain and if you

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:11.270 
you have everything to gain and if you
lose<00:01:09.540> everybody<00:01:10.049> expected<00:01:10.560> to<00:01:10.680> lose<00:01:10.799> anyway

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:11.280 
lose everybody expected to lose anyway

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:13.730 
lose everybody expected to lose anyway
so<00:01:11.760> the<00:01:11.880> pressure<00:01:12.210> is<00:01:12.540> really<00:01:12.930> not<00:01:13.110> on<00:01:13.290> my<00:01:13.470> down

00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:13.740 
so the pressure is really not on my down

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:15.870 
so the pressure is really not on my down
on<00:01:13.950> the<00:01:14.040> pressures<00:01:14.490> of<00:01:14.729> the<00:01:14.820> mango

00:01:15.870 --> 00:01:15.880 
on the pressures of the mango

00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:19.440 
on the pressures of the mango
and<00:01:16.470> that<00:01:17.470> I<00:01:17.500> think<00:01:17.830> is<00:01:18.670> something<00:01:19.060> which

00:01:19.440 --> 00:01:19.450 
and that I think is something which

00:01:19.450 --> 00:01:22.380 
and that I think is something which
really<00:01:19.659> stimulates<00:01:20.560> and<00:01:21.040> motivates<00:01:21.610> Marcos

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:22.390 
really stimulates and motivates Marcos

00:01:22.390 --> 00:01:25.680 
really stimulates and motivates Marcos

that car not only wins but wins Wow in

00:01:38.320 --> 00:01:40.080 
that car not only wins but wins Wow in
this<00:01:38.530> fight<00:01:38.799> to<00:01:39.009> project<00:01:39.460> him<00:01:39.610> into<00:01:39.820> that<00:01:39.970> my

00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:40.090 
this fight to project him into that my

00:01:40.090 --> 00:01:41.550 
this fight to project him into that my
with<00:01:40.240> the<00:01:40.330> top<00:01:40.539> but<00:01:40.750> yeah<00:01:40.899> I<00:01:40.930> think<00:01:41.020> the<00:01:41.320> key<00:01:41.530> is

00:01:41.550 --> 00:01:41.560 
with the top but yeah I think the key is

00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:43.710 
with the top but yeah I think the key is
the<00:01:41.950> win<00:01:42.159> because<00:01:42.789> he's<00:01:43.060> going<00:01:43.360> in<00:01:43.539> not

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:43.720 
the win because he's going in not

00:01:43.720 --> 00:01:45.300 
the win because he's going in not
against<00:01:44.049> you<00:01:44.200> know<00:01:44.320> when<00:01:44.470> you<00:01:44.590> go<00:01:44.740> in<00:01:44.890> against

against you know when you go in against
an<00:01:45.460> easy<00:01:45.640> opponent<00:01:46.090> then<00:01:47.020> it<00:01:47.170> becomes

even at even a small hundred and forty
pounds<00:03:28.620> he<00:03:28.890> probably<00:03:29.130> could<00:03:29.370> make<00:03:29.400> 135<00:03:30.330> for

that matter yeah and
you<00:03:33.760> know<00:03:33.849> I<00:03:34.360> think<00:03:34.420> the<00:03:34.810> 147<00:03:35.709> was<00:03:35.890> more

opportunistic<00:03:36.730> for<00:03:37.150> him<00:03:37.360> I<00:03:37.599> probably<00:03:37.989> would

00:03:38.699 --> 00:03:38.709 
opportunistic for him I probably would

00:03:38.709 --> 00:03:41.009
