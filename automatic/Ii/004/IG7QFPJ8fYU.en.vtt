00:01:00.100 --> 00:01:00.110 
but it made me dig deep and realize that

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:05.040

00:01:08.170 --> 00:01:08.180 
yes even though I had a choice it

00:01:08.180 --> 00:01:10.000 
yes even though I had a choice it
doesn't<00:01:08.960> mean<00:01:09.080> that<00:01:09.170> it<00:01:09.290> was<00:01:09.410> an<00:01:09.530> easy<00:01:09.830> choice

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:10.010
