 played and of course professional 

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:47.809
 by the way, for English football as well 

00:00:46.129 --> 00:00:50.510
 for 90 percent of all other leagues 

00:00:47.809 --> 00:00:52.430
 world servos lutz beautiful that you are yes 

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:55.040
 hello first a small correction are 

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:56.330
 at least 90 percent or are in the 

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:59.180
 the same time a bad start 

00:00:56.330 --> 00:01:00.799
 oh yes that goes on my cap that 

00:00:59.180 --> 00:01:03.229
 we try to dub this easy 

00:01:00.799 --> 00:01:05.390
 directly into the game and start 

00:01:03.229 --> 00:01:08.780
 in the first scene as the second minute 

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:11.119
 the and very important won 

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:12.820
 battles in midfield , it goes out 

00:01:11.119 --> 00:01:15.160
 on the right side 

00:01:12.820 --> 00:01:17.480
 jeremy toljan gets the ball now 

00:01:15.160 --> 00:01:19.040
 crosses inside and then we are 

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:21.050
 really something special alu 

00:01:19.040 --> 00:01:22.460
 rent then wonderful shot with 

00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:25.090
 left in the angle of tomorrow 

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:26.870
 Of course that was an absolute dreamless 

00:01:25.090 --> 00:01:29.060
 here again in the repetition 

00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:30.910
 can watch the keeper of the and what 

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:32.570
 turn it on from your view 

00:01:30.910 --> 00:01:35.320
 probably not even me 

00:01:32.570 --> 00:01:38.150
 So really an absolute then 

00:01:35.320 --> 00:01:40.470
 breaks in so well did absolutely none 

00:01:38.150 --> 00:01:43.500
 possibility also here is of the us 

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:46.200
 So if she picks up early leadership for 

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:47.760
 the tsg we look just a little further 

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:49.860
 quarter of an hour is played here 

00:01:47.760 --> 00:01:52.320
 little to oppressive come to this 

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:54.960
 possibility yes again about the 

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:56.880
 right side of england sam beam with 

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:58.860
 the flank and of course an important one 

00:01:56.880 --> 00:02:00.930
 ball for ulli baumann early to play 

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:03.590
 go because they just get one 

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:06.300
 to feel and to be in the game 

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:08.790
 next scene a few minutes further 

00:02:06.300 --> 00:02:11.130
 brand has a very good start in the 

00:02:08.790 --> 00:02:13.470
 partie caught trying here again 

00:02:11.130 --> 00:02:15.450
 in this scene uses what can you us 

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:17.910
 jonathan schmid also say that 

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:20.190
 again over the ball on the right and then 

00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:22.320
 again with the left foot tried in 

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:23.430
 to circle the angle also in very good 

00:02:22.320 --> 00:02:27.500
 conclusion would be difficult moments 

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:29.910
 but it can not be in again 

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:32.880
 short after standard situation for leeds 

00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:35.160
 free kick by kevin phillips from 

00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:36.390
 Tor pulled away with right and then 

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:38.370
 da canada with his head ball 

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:40.470
 he almost looked in so well 

00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:41.790
 very good run is the striker but 

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:44.250
 just miss is also over 

00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:46.620
 so it remains close to the 1 0 he 

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:50.269
 is also over so that is often left 

00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:50.269
 now with the next standard situation 

00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:54.780
 then in the penalty area three lost 

00:02:53.370 --> 00:02:58.410
 header duels on our side 

00:02:54.780 --> 00:03:01.790
 and that makes it all very well and 

00:02:58.410 --> 00:03:03.900
 want the ball untenable in goal 12 

00:03:01.790 --> 00:03:06.959
 until then you can actually say 

00:03:03.900 --> 00:03:08.700
 not necessarily so 1 1 in the 24 

00:03:06.959 --> 00:03:11.340
 minute we look at one again 

00:03:08.700 --> 00:03:12.900
 scene at the end of this half-time fabian 

00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:14.430
 schÃ¤r comes here immediately in scene man 

00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:17.340
 must remember that already has yellow lutz 

00:03:14.430 --> 00:03:19.850
 that's risky or not 

00:03:17.340 --> 00:03:23.070
 risky but just ripped off 

00:03:19.850 --> 00:03:25.340
 positive then 100 really great 

00:03:23.070 --> 00:03:27.630
 a tackling clarifies the situation 

00:03:25.340 --> 00:03:30.180
 underline that the case is not only 

00:03:27.630 --> 00:03:32.730
 two victories of 1990 experienced man 

00:03:30.180 --> 00:03:34.650
 So super new purchase for the tsg on 

00:03:32.730 --> 00:03:37.230
 the fans are looking forward to the bundesliga with 1 1 

00:03:34.650 --> 00:03:38.400
 go into the cabins after 45 minutes 

00:03:37.230 --> 00:03:39.870
 what do we have until now for a game 

00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:41.060
 seen what an interim conclusion can 

00:03:39.870 --> 00:03:44.020
 to draw 

00:03:41.060 --> 00:03:47.180
 yes , of course, is typically English 

00:03:44.020 --> 00:03:49.310
 physically stressed and rose pride names 

00:03:47.180 --> 00:03:51.170
 a very intense lot 

00:03:49.310 --> 00:03:53.390
 running towards press in on us 

00:03:51.170 --> 00:03:56.780
 pages and also for the audience 

00:03:53.390 --> 00:03:58.430
 very interesting game but a lot 

00:03:56.780 --> 00:04:00.050
 bring just let's see it 

00:03:58.430 --> 00:04:01.459
 start also directly rhine changed 

00:04:00.050 --> 00:04:04.480
 of course was in these as usual 

00:04:01.459 --> 00:04:08.000
 always playing games ample 

00:04:04.480 --> 00:04:14.540
 we start in the 54 minute something 

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:17.180
 we see here comes in the supercross 

00:04:14.540 --> 00:04:19.370
 vontobel really in the alley harry 

00:04:17.180 --> 00:04:22.070
 comes alone before the keeper makes you 

00:04:19.370 --> 00:04:23.620
 great is that he is good and then comes 

00:04:22.070 --> 00:04:25.490
 even a bit too middle 

00:04:23.620 --> 00:04:27.110
 all you have to do is just the keeper schoder 

00:04:25.490 --> 00:04:29.300
 make compliment because I have a very long time 

00:04:27.110 --> 00:04:34.250
 Waited and we again to 

00:04:29.300 --> 00:04:36.919
 conclusion a recommendation but no 

00:04:34.250 --> 00:04:40.580
 problem for sylvester in the Italian 

00:04:36.919 --> 00:04:42.680
 keeper on the side of vice directs so 

00:04:40.580 --> 00:04:44.240
 Standard situation of Liza the first 

00:04:42.680 --> 00:04:46.280
 half-time already seen second half 

00:04:44.240 --> 00:04:49.280
 By default, the tsg we are looking at 

00:04:46.280 --> 00:04:51.770
 let's just say that's about 25 26 

00:04:49.280 --> 00:04:53.270
 meter jonathan schmid yes good 25 meters 

00:04:51.770 --> 00:04:55.250
 in the right foot over the wall though 

00:04:53.270 --> 00:04:58.450
 West are the ball of course 

00:04:55.250 --> 00:05:00.410
 long for the dollar from salt to the side 

00:04:58.450 --> 00:05:02.570
 nevertheless important because again and again 

00:05:00.410 --> 00:05:03.640
 to come to a conclusion and the keeper 

00:05:02.570 --> 00:05:08.919
 to promote 

00:05:03.640 --> 00:05:11.690
 the 68 minute this scene really 

00:05:08.919 --> 00:05:14.330
 excellent move through the middle 

00:05:11.690 --> 00:05:16.130
 cavigelli musicians then already sets the 

00:05:14.330 --> 00:05:19.460
 ball back and think about it 

00:05:16.130 --> 00:05:21.270
 take great running then I run into the 

00:05:19.460 --> 00:05:24.870
 flank in the pas rhein 

00:05:21.270 --> 00:05:27.320
 makes the important 2 1 exactly the tsg 

00:05:24.870 --> 00:05:29.250
 goes in guidance 68 minute as I said 

00:05:27.320 --> 00:05:31.560
 we still have a scene in this scene 

00:05:29.250 --> 00:05:36.050
 play 70 10 minutes so only two minutes 

00:05:31.560 --> 00:05:38.670
 after that let's go over left this time 

00:05:36.050 --> 00:05:40.680
 through three of our defensive players 

00:05:38.670 --> 00:05:42.660
 and the conclusion was actually 

00:05:40.680 --> 00:05:44.880
 nothing special nevertheless a stele 

00:05:42.660 --> 00:05:45.630
 There is a lot of belief because he already has one 

00:05:44.880 --> 00:05:48.810
 needed a bit 

00:05:45.630 --> 00:05:50.550
 So the tsg wins at 2 2 1 

00:05:48.810 --> 00:05:52.770
 against leeds united an intense 

00:05:50.550 --> 00:05:54.660
 strenuous body-stressed game though 

00:05:52.770 --> 00:05:56.850
 It just sees victory and completely without 

00:05:54.660 --> 00:05:58.860
 injuries managed that too 

00:05:56.850 --> 00:06:02.970
 Thank goodness Lutz for your help 

00:05:58.860 --> 00:06:05.340
 and support, of course, been here 

00:06:02.970 --> 00:06:07.170
 to be important victory in one 

00:06:05.340 --> 00:06:09.360
 really good game and there times in 

00:06:07.170 --> 00:06:13.670
 Norway are always and I am 

00:06:09.360 --> 00:06:13.670
 norwegian course this day
