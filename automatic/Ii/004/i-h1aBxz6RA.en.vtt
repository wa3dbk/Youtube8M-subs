00:00:41.630 --> 00:00:45.790 

I<00:00:43.330> think<00:00:44.330> wheelchair<00:00:44.780> ballroom<00:00:44.930> dancing<00:00:45.620> is<00:00:45.740> a

00:00:45.790 --> 00:00:45.800 
I think wheelchair ballroom dancing is a

00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:48.070 
I think wheelchair ballroom dancing is a
great<00:00:46.220> activity<00:00:46.610> for<00:00:46.790> especially<00:00:47.570> for<00:00:47.960> people

00:00:48.070 --> 00:00:48.080 
great activity for especially for people

00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:50.320 
great activity for especially for people
with<00:00:48.380> spinal<00:00:48.560> cord<00:00:48.740> injuries<00:00:49.340> I<00:00:49.550> love<00:00:50.180> it

00:00:50.320 --> 00:00:50.330 
with spinal cord injuries I love it

00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:53.140 
with spinal cord injuries I love it
because<00:00:50.990> it's<00:00:51.500> social<00:00:52.010> and<00:00:52.220> it<00:00:52.910> brings

00:00:53.140 --> 00:00:53.150 
because it's social and it brings

00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:55.450 
because it's social and it brings
together<00:00:53.390> the<00:00:53.840> able-bodied<00:00:54.230> population<00:00:54.530> and

00:00:55.450 --> 00:00:55.460 
together the able-bodied population and

00:00:55.460 --> 00:00:58.930 
together the able-bodied population and
a<00:00:56.000> disabled<00:00:56.540> population<00:00:57.290> and<00:00:57.560> it's<00:00:58.310> not<00:00:58.550> only

00:00:58.930 --> 00:00:58.940 
a disabled population and it's not only

00:00:58.940 --> 00:01:01.660 
a disabled population and it's not only
therapeutic<00:00:59.570> for<00:00:59.780> the<00:01:00.190> people<00:01:01.190> with<00:01:01.400> spinal

00:01:01.660 --> 00:01:01.670 
therapeutic for the people with spinal

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:04.030 
therapeutic for the people with spinal
cord<00:01:01.880> injuries<00:01:02.330> but<00:01:02.570> I<00:01:02.600> think<00:01:02.900> it<00:01:03.020> helps<00:01:03.530> raise

00:01:04.030 --> 00:01:04.040 
cord injuries but I think it helps raise

00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:07.390 
cord injuries but I think it helps raise
awareness<00:01:04.100> and<00:01:05.770> helps<00:01:06.770> the<00:01:06.980> able-bodied

00:01:07.390 --> 00:01:07.400 
awareness and helps the able-bodied

00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:09.460 
awareness and helps the able-bodied
population<00:01:08.030> feel<00:01:08.660> more<00:01:08.840> comfortable<00:01:09.320> around

00:01:09.460 --> 00:01:09.470 
population feel more comfortable around

00:01:09.470 --> 00:01:12.730 
population feel more comfortable around
people<00:01:09.710> with<00:01:10.010> disabilities<00:01:11.350> so<00:01:12.350> with<00:01:12.530> this

00:01:12.730 --> 00:01:12.740 
people with disabilities so with this

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:15.310 
people with disabilities so with this
research<00:01:13.190> we're<00:01:13.670> looking<00:01:14.119> at<00:01:14.330> a<00:01:14.570> myriad<00:01:15.229> of

their basic demographic information

00:01:21.640 --> 00:01:24.219 
their basic demographic information
we're<00:01:22.640> getting<00:01:22.970> their<00:01:23.150> injury<00:01:23.570> duration

00:01:24.219 --> 00:01:24.229 
we're getting their injury duration

00:01:24.229 --> 00:01:28.210 
we're getting their injury duration

we're also looking at physical and
physiological<00:01:51.819> variables<00:01:52.819> so<00:01:53.360> we're

00:01:53.499 --> 00:01:53.509 
physiological variables so we're

00:01:53.509 --> 00:01:56.130 
physiological variables so we're
assessing<00:01:53.960> their<00:01:54.380> range<00:01:54.590> of<00:01:54.740> motion<00:01:55.000> strength

with but I think it's just added to the

00:02:54.470 --> 00:02:57.850 
with but I think it's just added to the
grid<00:02:54.830> and<00:02:55.100> made<00:02:55.910> it<00:02:56.030> even<00:02:56.150> better<00:02:56.530> definitely

00:02:57.850 --> 00:02:57.860 
grid and made it even better definitely
