experiments map or once again and I've
added<00:00:19.020> some<00:00:19.230> things<00:00:19.830> to<00:00:20.130> the<00:00:20.550> redstone<00:00:21.359> sugar

00:00:21.859 --> 00:00:21.869 
added some things to the redstone sugar

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:25.130 
added some things to the redstone sugar
area<00:00:22.670> and<00:00:23.670> I<00:00:24.090> will<00:00:24.269> be<00:00:24.420> leaving<00:00:24.570> the<00:00:24.810> link<00:00:24.960> to

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:26.730 
this map in the description below as

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:30.410 
this map in the description below as
always<00:00:26.820> um<00:00:27.420> and<00:00:28.490> let's<00:00:29.490> get<00:00:29.730> started

00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:30.420 
always um and let's get started

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:33.170 
always um and let's get started
so<00:00:30.750> what<00:00:31.619> we're<00:00:31.800> doing<00:00:31.830> here<00:00:32.160> is<00:00:32.610> the<00:00:32.910> pressure

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:33.180 
so what we're doing here is the pressure

Edition<00:00:35.460> so<00:00:36.420> I<00:00:36.750> got<00:00:37.380> this<00:00:37.559> from<00:00:38.070> mr.<00:00:38.730> moon<00:00:38.910> mr.

Edition so I got this from mr. moon mr.

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:41.720 
Edition so I got this from mr. moon mr.
moon<00:00:39.930> pig<00:00:40.170> line<00:00:40.350> I<00:00:40.680> will<00:00:41.040> be<00:00:41.250> leaving<00:00:41.550> a<00:00:41.610> link

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:41.730 
moon pig line I will be leaving a link

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:43.970 
moon pig line I will be leaving a link
to<00:00:41.940> his<00:00:42.930> video<00:00:43.140> in<00:00:43.350> the<00:00:43.440> description<00:00:43.559> below

and I believe he got it from somebody
else<00:00:47.430> on<00:00:47.940> minecraft<00:00:48.840> forums<00:00:49.230> so<00:00:49.500> if<00:00:49.770> I<00:00:49.950> can

else on minecraft forums so if I can
find<00:00:50.370> him<00:00:50.550> then<00:00:50.760> I'll<00:00:50.850> link<00:00:51.090> him<00:00:51.360> as<00:00:51.539> well<00:00:52.190> but

find him then I'll link him as well but

00:00:53.390 --> 00:00:57.260 
find him then I'll link him as well but
basically<00:00:54.469> as<00:00:55.469> you<00:00:55.710> all<00:00:55.890> know<00:00:56.100> there<00:00:56.550> is<00:00:56.699> no

basically as you all know there is no

00:00:57.270 --> 00:01:00.200 
basically as you all know there is no
red<00:00:57.570> stone<00:00:57.960> as<00:00:58.230> of<00:00:58.710> now<00:00:58.980> in<00:00:59.280> Minecraft<00:01:00.059> Pocket

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:00.210 
red stone as of now in Minecraft Pocket

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:03.680 
red stone as of now in Minecraft Pocket
Edition<00:01:00.710> so<00:01:01.710> we<00:01:02.640> can't<00:01:02.910> have<00:01:03.120> fresher<00:01:03.390> plates

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:03.690 
Edition so we can't have fresher plates

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:07.340 
Edition so we can't have fresher plates
or<00:01:03.930> pan<00:01:04.500> we<00:01:04.769> so<00:01:05.549> as<00:01:05.610> you<00:01:05.670> can<00:01:05.790> see<00:01:05.850> here<00:01:06.360> this

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:07.350 
or pan we so as you can see here this

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:10.640 
or pan we so as you can see here this
water<00:01:07.710> is<00:01:08.189> only<00:01:09.000> flowing<00:01:09.420> one<00:01:09.780> way<00:01:10.049> which<00:01:10.470> is

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:10.650 
water is only flowing one way which is

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:13.550 
water is only flowing one way which is
kind<00:01:10.890> of<00:01:10.950> weird<00:01:11.220> and<00:01:12.020> there's<00:01:13.020> a<00:01:13.080> whole<00:01:13.290> piece

00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:13.560 
kind of weird and there's a whole piece

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:14.840 
kind of weird and there's a whole piece
of<00:01:13.590> ground<00:01:13.860> there<00:01:14.100> what's<00:01:14.400> is<00:01:14.520> there<00:01:14.670> for

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:14.850 
of ground there what's is there for

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:17.660 
of ground there what's is there for
reason<00:01:15.150> so<00:01:15.450> if<00:01:15.869> I<00:01:15.990> just<00:01:16.200> show<00:01:16.350> you<00:01:16.409> here<00:01:16.680> one

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:17.670 
reason so if I just show you here one

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:20.090 
reason so if I just show you here one
two<00:01:18.090> three<00:01:18.570> four<00:01:18.990> so<00:01:19.409> if<00:01:19.470> you<00:01:19.590> make<00:01:19.740> a<00:01:19.770> full

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:20.100 
two three four so if you make a full

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:23.929 
two three four so if you make a full
boat<00:01:20.340> one<00:01:21.380> ditch<00:01:22.380> you<00:01:23.220> can<00:01:23.369> get<00:01:23.549> some<00:01:23.729> water

00:01:23.929 --> 00:01:23.939 
boat one ditch you can get some water

00:01:23.939 --> 00:01:29.060 
boat one ditch you can get some water
and<00:01:24.479> a<00:01:25.259> whole<00:01:27.140> what<00:01:28.140> want<00:01:28.290> to<00:01:28.320> do<00:01:28.470> is<00:01:28.680> make<00:01:29.040> a

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:29.070 
and a whole what want to do is make a

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:31.580 
and a whole what want to do is make a
hole<00:01:29.460> there<00:01:29.970> on<00:01:30.509> one<00:01:30.780> of<00:01:30.810> the<00:01:30.960> sides<00:01:31.200> whichever

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:31.590 
hole there on one of the sides whichever

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:34.910 
hole there on one of the sides whichever
and<00:01:31.890> put<00:01:32.340> hold<00:01:32.759> the<00:01:32.939> ground<00:01:33.150> next<00:01:33.600> to<00:01:33.780> it<00:01:33.990> one

00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:34.920 
and put hold the ground next to it one

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:37.819 
and put hold the ground next to it one
block<00:01:35.210> across<00:01:36.210> well<00:01:36.960> you<00:01:37.170> can<00:01:37.320> see<00:01:37.500> how<00:01:37.710> it

00:01:37.819 --> 00:01:37.829 
block across well you can see how it

00:01:37.829 --> 00:01:40.039 
block across well you can see how it
done<00:01:38.009> it<00:01:38.100> and<00:01:38.310> put<00:01:38.790> a<00:01:38.820> water<00:01:39.090> bucket<00:01:39.689> right

00:01:40.039 --> 00:01:40.049 
done it and put a water bucket right

00:01:40.049 --> 00:01:41.960 
done it and put a water bucket right
here<00:01:40.110> and<00:01:40.470> as<00:01:41.070> you<00:01:41.159> can<00:01:41.250> see<00:01:41.310> the<00:01:41.579> water<00:01:41.790> only

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:41.970 
here and as you can see the water only

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:44.030 
here and as you can see the water only
flows<00:01:42.240> to<00:01:42.360> this<00:01:42.479> side<00:01:42.720> and<00:01:43.350> then<00:01:43.470> just<00:01:43.500> fill<00:01:43.890> it

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:44.040 
flows to this side and then just fill it

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:45.410 
flows to this side and then just fill it
up<00:01:44.130> with<00:01:44.310> a<00:01:44.369> stone<00:01:44.759> block<00:01:44.970> or<00:01:45.270> whatever

00:01:45.410 --> 00:01:45.420 
up with a stone block or whatever

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:48.499 
up with a stone block or whatever
whichever<00:01:45.960> block<00:01:46.259> and<00:01:47.189> as<00:01:47.280> you<00:01:47.369> can<00:01:47.490> see<00:01:47.700> it's

00:01:48.499 --> 00:01:48.509 
whichever block and as you can see it's

00:01:48.509 --> 00:01:50.510 
whichever block and as you can see it's
just<00:01:48.570> going<00:01:48.960> one<00:01:49.259> way<00:01:49.290> so<00:01:49.979> that's<00:01:50.250> kind<00:01:50.490> of

00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:50.520 
just going one way so that's kind of

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:53.270 
just going one way so that's kind of
weird<00:01:50.700> but<00:01:51.509> the<00:01:52.110> way<00:01:52.350> this<00:01:52.680> acts<00:01:52.950> like<00:01:53.159> a

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:53.280 
weird but the way this acts like a

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:56.480 
weird but the way this acts like a
pressure<00:01:53.579> plate<00:01:53.790> is<00:01:54.479> that<00:01:54.720> when<00:01:54.990> you<00:01:55.490> trample

00:01:56.480 --> 00:01:56.490 
pressure plate is that when you trample

00:01:56.490 --> 00:01:58.719 
pressure plate is that when you trample
this<00:01:56.790> whole<00:01:57.210> ground<00:01:57.630> like<00:01:57.810> a<00:01:57.869> pressure<00:01:58.110> plate

00:01:58.719 --> 00:01:58.729 
this whole ground like a pressure plate

00:01:58.729 --> 00:02:01.399 
this whole ground like a pressure plate
it<00:01:59.729> will<00:01:59.969> update<00:02:00.210> the<00:02:00.509> water<00:02:00.689> block<00:02:01.020> and<00:02:01.290> all

00:02:01.399 --> 00:02:01.409 
it will update the water block and all

00:02:01.409 --> 00:02:04.370 
it will update the water block and all
all<00:02:01.500> flow<00:02:01.799> the<00:02:01.950> other<00:02:01.979> way<00:02:02.719> so<00:02:03.719> that's

00:02:04.370 --> 00:02:04.380 
all flow the other way so that's

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:08.930 
all flow the other way so that's
basically<00:02:05.750> the<00:02:06.750> basis<00:02:07.350> that<00:02:07.649> this<00:02:08.489> works

00:02:08.930 --> 00:02:08.940 
basically the basis that this works

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:10.309 
basically the basis that this works
around<00:02:09.179> oops

00:02:10.309 --> 00:02:10.319 
around oops

00:02:10.319 --> 00:02:13.430 
around oops
and<00:02:11.209> so<00:02:12.209> as<00:02:12.270> you<00:02:12.360> can<00:02:12.390> see<00:02:12.660> here<00:02:12.930> I

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:13.440 
and so as you can see here I

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:16.040 
and so as you can see here I
set<00:02:13.980> up<00:02:14.160> there<00:02:14.370> with<00:02:14.550> some<00:02:14.790> sand<00:02:15.060> on<00:02:15.420> it<00:02:15.510> sand

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:16.050 
set up there with some sand on it sand

00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:19.040 
set up there with some sand on it sand
blocks<00:02:16.260> on<00:02:16.410> it<00:02:16.440> so<00:02:17.340> when<00:02:17.760> the<00:02:18.000> I'd<00:02:18.450> trampled

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:19.050 
blocks on it so when the I'd trampled

00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:21.530 
blocks on it so when the I'd trampled
the<00:02:19.140> whole<00:02:19.320> ground<00:02:19.710> the<00:02:20.520> water<00:02:20.910> will<00:02:21.240> flow

00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:21.540 
the whole ground the water will flow

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:23.870 
the whole ground the water will flow
there<00:02:21.870> break<00:02:22.590> the<00:02:22.770> torch<00:02:23.040> break<00:02:23.400> all<00:02:23.670> these

00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:23.880 
there break the torch break all these

00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:26.330 
there break the torch break all these
pieces<00:02:24.360> and<00:02:24.660> click<00:02:24.990> the<00:02:25.140> sign<00:02:25.380> chain<00:02:25.680> and<00:02:25.920> then

00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:26.340 
pieces and click the sign chain and then

00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:29.990 
pieces and click the sign chain and then
the<00:02:26.520> Scrabble<00:02:26.940> block<00:02:27.540> should<00:02:28.050> fall<00:02:28.650> so<00:02:29.550> if<00:02:29.820> I

00:02:29.990 --> 00:02:30.000 
the Scrabble block should fall so if I

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:32.840 
the Scrabble block should fall so if I
just<00:02:30.240> sample<00:02:30.900> that<00:02:31.080> as<00:02:31.770> you<00:02:31.950> can<00:02:32.100> see<00:02:32.340> the

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:32.850 
just sample that as you can see the

00:02:32.850 --> 00:02:35.090 
just sample that as you can see the
gravel<00:02:33.270> block<00:02:33.740> fell

00:02:35.090 --> 00:02:35.100 
gravel block fell

00:02:35.100 --> 00:02:37.490 
gravel block fell
yeah<00:02:35.490> the<00:02:35.640> Grabel<00:02:35.940> block<00:02:36.450> fell<00:02:36.930> after

00:02:37.490 --> 00:02:37.500 
yeah the Grabel block fell after

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:41.270 
yeah the Grabel block fell after
updating<00:02:38.310> the<00:02:38.400> water<00:02:38.580> except<00:02:39.180> for<00:02:39.420> so<00:02:40.410> as<00:02:41.190> you

00:02:41.270 --> 00:02:41.280 
updating the water except for so as you

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:43.070 
updating the water except for so as you
can<00:02:41.400> see<00:02:41.460> that<00:02:41.790> that<00:02:41.940> is<00:02:42.120> basically<00:02:42.330> like<00:02:42.960> the

00:02:43.070 --> 00:02:43.080 
can see that that is basically like the

00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:44.750 
can see that that is basically like the
closest<00:02:43.410> you<00:02:43.530> can<00:02:43.560> get<00:02:43.860> to<00:02:43.920> a<00:02:44.280> pressure<00:02:44.550> plate

00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:44.760 
closest you can get to a pressure plate

00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:47.240 
closest you can get to a pressure plate
in<00:02:45.030> my<00:02:45.180> pocket<00:02:45.630> edition<00:02:45.720> and<00:02:46.140> here<00:02:46.770> are<00:02:47.010> two

00:02:47.240 --> 00:02:47.250 
in my pocket edition and here are two

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:49.820 
in my pocket edition and here are two
pretty<00:02:47.730> cool<00:02:48.030> things<00:02:48.360> that<00:02:48.720> I<00:02:48.750> have<00:02:49.020> made<00:02:49.290> and

00:02:49.820 --> 00:02:49.830 
pretty cool things that I have made and

00:02:49.830 --> 00:02:51.320 
pretty cool things that I have made and
the<00:02:49.980> quality<00:02:50.370> there<00:02:50.520> and<00:02:50.760> there's<00:02:51.000> some<00:02:51.150> other

00:02:51.320 --> 00:02:51.330 
the quality there and there's some other

00:02:51.330 --> 00:02:52.820 
the quality there and there's some other
things<00:02:51.420> that<00:02:51.690> are<00:02:51.810> hopefully<00:02:52.380> going<00:02:52.680> to<00:02:52.740> make

00:02:52.820 --> 00:02:52.830 
things that are hopefully going to make

00:02:52.830 --> 00:02:54.700 
things that are hopefully going to make
as<00:02:53.190> well<00:02:53.370> so<00:02:53.610> as<00:02:53.700> you<00:02:53.790> can<00:02:53.880> see<00:02:54.090> here<00:02:54.300> it<00:02:54.360> says<00:02:54.510> a

00:02:54.700 --> 00:02:54.710 
as well so as you can see here it says a

00:02:54.710 --> 00:02:57.050 
as well so as you can see here it says a
demo<00:02:55.710> of<00:02:55.920> how<00:02:55.950> the<00:02:56.130> pressure<00:02:56.370> plate<00:02:56.610> concept

00:02:57.050 --> 00:02:57.060 
demo of how the pressure plate concept

00:02:57.060 --> 00:02:59.420 
demo of how the pressure plate concept
over<00:02:57.360> there<00:02:57.510> could<00:02:57.870> be<00:02:57.900> used<00:02:58.860> in<00:02:59.010> adventure

00:02:59.420 --> 00:02:59.430 
over there could be used in adventure

00:02:59.430 --> 00:03:01.840 
over there could be used in adventure
map<00:02:59.610> so<00:02:59.880> I'm<00:03:00.060> gonna<00:03:00.240> just<00:03:00.390> try<00:03:00.600> it<00:03:00.720> out<00:03:00.870> just

00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:01.850 
map so I'm gonna just try it out just

00:03:01.850 --> 00:03:04.790 
map so I'm gonna just try it out just
gonna<00:03:02.850> get<00:03:03.030> these<00:03:03.600> my<00:03:03.870> inventory<00:03:04.110> but<00:03:04.680> I'm

00:03:04.790 --> 00:03:04.800 
gonna get these my inventory but I'm

00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:06.470 
gonna get these my inventory but I'm
gonna<00:03:04.980> pretend<00:03:05.460> this<00:03:05.820> is<00:03:06.000> just<00:03:06.150> an<00:03:06.240> eventual

00:03:06.470 --> 00:03:06.480 
gonna pretend this is just an eventual

00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:08.360 
gonna pretend this is just an eventual
map<00:03:06.720> mine<00:03:06.870> as<00:03:06.990> you<00:03:07.080> can<00:03:07.200> see<00:03:07.350> down<00:03:07.500> there<00:03:07.680> there

00:03:08.360 --> 00:03:08.370 
map mine as you can see down there there

00:03:08.370 --> 00:03:10.790 
map mine as you can see down there there
is<00:03:08.520> a<00:03:08.760> piece<00:03:09.210> of<00:03:09.240> hood<00:03:09.600> ground<00:03:10.080> but<00:03:10.470> before<00:03:10.770> I

00:03:10.790 --> 00:03:10.800 
is a piece of hood ground but before I

00:03:10.800 --> 00:03:14.570 
is a piece of hood ground but before I
do<00:03:10.920> that<00:03:11.150> if<00:03:12.150> I<00:03:12.420> just<00:03:12.630> open<00:03:12.810> this<00:03:13.080> up<00:03:13.440> you<00:03:14.400> can

00:03:14.570 --> 00:03:14.580 
do that if I just open this up you can

00:03:14.580 --> 00:03:17.210 
do that if I just open this up you can
see<00:03:14.810> that<00:03:15.810> this<00:03:16.290> is<00:03:16.500> right<00:03:16.650> here<00:03:16.860> and<00:03:17.070> the

00:03:17.210 --> 00:03:17.220 
see that this is right here and the

00:03:17.220 --> 00:03:19.490 
see that this is right here and the
whole<00:03:17.250> ground<00:03:17.850> is<00:03:18.090> right<00:03:18.270> there<00:03:18.450> so<00:03:18.810> when

00:03:19.490 --> 00:03:19.500 
whole ground is right there so when

00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:21.350 
whole ground is right there so when
you've<00:03:19.620> done<00:03:19.650> that<00:03:19.800> it<00:03:20.250> will<00:03:20.610> flow<00:03:20.940> down<00:03:21.120> here

00:03:21.350 --> 00:03:21.360 
you've done that it will flow down here

00:03:21.360 --> 00:03:24.010 
you've done that it will flow down here
plate<00:03:21.630> the<00:03:21.780> torch<00:03:22.050> break<00:03:22.800> the<00:03:22.950> sand<00:03:23.340> and

00:03:24.010 --> 00:03:24.020 
plate the torch break the sand and

00:03:24.020 --> 00:03:29.330 
plate the torch break the sand and
therefore<00:03:25.020> break<00:03:25.800> this<00:03:26.520> sign<00:03:26.910> Shane<00:03:28.160> which<00:03:29.160> is

00:03:29.330 --> 00:03:29.340 
therefore break this sign Shane which is

00:03:29.340 --> 00:03:32.060 
therefore break this sign Shane which is
holding<00:03:29.640> this<00:03:29.760> sand<00:03:30.060> up<00:03:30.270> and<00:03:30.480> then<00:03:31.320> the<00:03:31.709> sand

00:03:32.060 --> 00:03:32.070 
holding this sand up and then the sand

00:03:32.070 --> 00:03:36.050 
holding this sand up and then the sand
will<00:03:32.370> fall<00:03:32.400> and<00:03:33.270> hopefully<00:03:33.950> and<00:03:34.950> it<00:03:35.520> will<00:03:35.760> let

00:03:36.050 --> 00:03:36.060 
will fall and hopefully and it will let

00:03:36.060 --> 00:03:39.500 
will fall and hopefully and it will let
you<00:03:36.209> go<00:03:36.420> past<00:03:36.780> so<00:03:37.760> after<00:03:38.760> just<00:03:38.970> covering<00:03:39.420> that

00:03:39.500 --> 00:03:39.510 
you go past so after just covering that

00:03:39.510 --> 00:03:43.009 
you go past so after just covering that
up<00:03:39.570> again<00:03:39.989> we'll<00:03:40.980> just<00:03:41.010> go<00:03:41.459> through<00:03:41.810> land<00:03:42.810> on

00:03:43.009 --> 00:03:43.019 
up again we'll just go through land on

00:03:43.019 --> 00:03:45.920 
up again we'll just go through land on
that<00:03:43.050> sample<00:03:44.010> it<00:03:44.130> then<00:03:44.459> as<00:03:44.640> you<00:03:44.730> can<00:03:44.880> see<00:03:45.060> it

00:03:45.920 --> 00:03:45.930 
that sample it then as you can see it

00:03:45.930 --> 00:03:48.470 
that sample it then as you can see it
lets<00:03:46.320> me<00:03:46.500> through<00:03:46.739> so<00:03:47.370> that<00:03:47.580> is<00:03:47.940> really<00:03:48.180> really

00:03:48.470 --> 00:03:48.480 
lets me through so that is really really

00:03:48.480 --> 00:03:50.900 
lets me through so that is really really
cool<00:03:48.780> I<00:03:48.810> think<00:03:49.320> and<00:03:49.830> I'm<00:03:49.980> quite<00:03:50.160> proud<00:03:50.220> of<00:03:50.820> that

00:03:50.900 --> 00:03:50.910 
cool I think and I'm quite proud of that

00:03:50.910 --> 00:03:53.479 
cool I think and I'm quite proud of that
and<00:03:51.150> then<00:03:51.810> here's<00:03:52.080> a<00:03:52.140> more<00:03:52.980> complex<00:03:53.370> version

00:03:53.479 --> 00:03:53.489 
and then here's a more complex version

00:03:53.489 --> 00:03:55.699 
and then here's a more complex version
of<00:03:53.790> that<00:03:53.880> so<00:03:54.300> we'll<00:03:54.870> complex<00:03:55.320> version<00:03:55.620> of

00:03:55.699 --> 00:03:55.709 
of that so we'll complex version of

00:03:55.709 --> 00:03:57.110 
of that so we'll complex version of
construction<00:03:56.220> and<00:03:56.310> enough<00:03:56.489> to<00:03:56.610> figure<00:03:56.850> it<00:03:57.000> out

00:03:57.110 --> 00:03:57.120 
construction and enough to figure it out

00:03:57.120 --> 00:03:59.509 
construction and enough to figure it out
and<00:03:57.300> you<00:03:57.360> will<00:03:57.570> need<00:03:57.720> a<00:03:57.750> potato<00:03:58.140> or<00:03:58.560> carrot

00:03:59.509 --> 00:03:59.519 
and you will need a potato or carrot

00:03:59.519 --> 00:04:01.580 
and you will need a potato or carrot
awesome<00:04:00.150> wheat<00:04:00.360> so<00:04:00.600> as<00:04:00.690> you<00:04:00.780> can<00:04:00.900> see<00:04:01.050> here<00:04:01.320> and

00:04:01.580 --> 00:04:01.590 
awesome wheat so as you can see here and

00:04:01.590 --> 00:04:04.699 
awesome wheat so as you can see here and
there<00:04:02.519> is<00:04:02.640> another<00:04:02.910> hold<00:04:03.660> ground<00:04:04.019> over<00:04:04.530> there

00:04:04.699 --> 00:04:04.709 
there is another hold ground over there

00:04:04.709 --> 00:04:09.170
