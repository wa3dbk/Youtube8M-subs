00:00:04.740 --> 00:00:08.860
 eva we still have one more day to spend clearly we have had to suffer 

00:00:08.860 --> 00:00:10.590
 a little more until Friday 

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:13.849
 then temperatures will drop and also in a marked way 

00:00:13.849 --> 00:00:18.040
 up to eight degrees in some areas west of Aragon in the rest between 

00:00:18.039 --> 00:00:21.940
 three and five degrees less than today but it's still late and also 

00:00:21.939 --> 00:00:24.610
 tomorrow the temperatures were very high 

00:00:24.610 --> 00:00:29.250
 notice that at a thousand 450 meters of altitude of monteagudo of the castle that afternoon 

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:31.679
 we expect maximum of up to 30 degrees 

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:35.510
 during the morning we have seen there skies in quite clear although 

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:38.769
 this afternoon they can grow up in clouds of evolution indeed they are already growing 

00:00:38.769 --> 00:00:41.950
 in some Teruel lands, mainly those of Albarracín 

00:00:41.950 --> 00:00:45.520
 and here we are at the foot of the Sierra de Gúdar in the basin of 

00:00:45.520 --> 00:00:49.260
 mijares here you can Genovese as we said during the afternoon and 

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:53.480
 some weak storms and isolated high temperatures and wind in 

00:00:53.480 --> 00:00:56.480
 these soft areas 

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:03.650
 and see in this ninth aspect that this one has a convective cloud of a 

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:07.620
 cumulus those that leave storms but this one is special has grown 

00:01:07.620 --> 00:01:12.140
 precisely to cause the heat of the fire that was generated yesterday in the 

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:15.600
 field of san gregorio heat is the source of energy creates strong 

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:20.000
 updrafts and the idea of ​​going up condenses when you get to more layers 

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:23.840
 cool of the atmosphere and these clouds are formed also condenses with 

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:28.320
 ease by the ash that acts as the nucleus of condensation in some 

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:31.520
 cases even these clouds end up leaving storms 

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:35.280
 that favor in the extinction of the fire in this case unfortunately not 

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:37.770
 It was like this 

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:41.579
 and we start today with the good news that temperatures are going to fall but it will be 

00:01:41.579 --> 00:01:44.060
 on Friday this is the map that the 

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:45.760
 Meteorology Statal Agency 

00:01:45.760 --> 00:01:49.770
 in it we see there that in some areas mainly in the west of Aragon in 

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:53.380
 the high five villas in Tarazona on a street the high bank and also in 

00:01:53.380 --> 00:01:54.790
 points of jacetania 

00:01:54.790 --> 00:01:59.210
 the temperatures can be between six and eight degrees lower than today 

00:01:59.210 --> 00:02:02.210
 they will also go down in the rest of Aragón between three and five in some 

00:02:02.210 --> 00:02:03.090
 points 

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:07.200
 a little less that will be on Friday at the moment the heat already from early hours 

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:10.960
 it was produced in quite high temperatures the minimums have been high 

00:02:10.960 --> 00:02:15.040
 although somewhat lower than yesterday we had 12 degrees just from 

00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:18.190
 minimum in teruel have slept phenomenally well also in others 

00:02:18.190 --> 00:02:22.139
 points of the ribagorza in benasque for example 12 and a half photo c 

00:02:22.139 --> 00:02:26.370
 in fact they include formigal and up to 20 in some points that of depression 

00:02:26.369 --> 00:02:27.340
 from the ebro 

00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:30.879
 at this time the temperatures are high 36 degrees mark the 

00:02:30.879 --> 00:02:34.520
 thermometers at some points and you still know that something will go up 

00:02:34.519 --> 00:02:37.989
 until six in the afternoon the maxims are not produced in the photos of the 

00:02:37.989 --> 00:02:40.210
 satellite deimos skies very clear 

00:02:40.210 --> 00:02:43.410
 the front that approaches must change something the situation now we will see 

00:02:43.410 --> 00:02:45.459
 if the cleared in much of Europe 

00:02:45.459 --> 00:02:49.190
 they also suffer this heat wave in some points of western europe hear 

00:02:49.189 --> 00:02:50.580
 paris for example 

00:02:50.580 --> 00:02:54.990
 the maximum expected is 37 degrees Celsius at this time they arrive at the 

00:02:54.990 --> 00:02:56.089
 3. 4 

00:02:56.089 --> 00:02:59.189
 and on the map of the time scheduled for tomorrow we see that front that is going 

00:02:59.189 --> 00:03:00.140
 approaching 

00:03:00.140 --> 00:03:04.299
 Mayer to the northwest of the peninsula and here it will leave rains we still do not 

00:03:04.299 --> 00:03:08.139
 but its influence continues to make the wind change from night 

00:03:08.139 --> 00:03:12.190
 will go blowing northwest began to lower temperatures in the morning 

00:03:12.189 --> 00:03:16.099
 still the wind will be from the south east and south loose winds to keep 

00:03:16.099 --> 00:03:19.920
 at very high temperatures with some storms during the afternoon 

00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:24.329
 especially mainly in the northern third especially in the jacetania in 

00:03:24.329 --> 00:03:26.709
 other areas of the Iberian system could also 

00:03:26.709 --> 00:03:28.370
 it was some rain in the afternoon 

00:03:28.370 --> 00:03:31.690
 the temperatures at the moment without big changes tomorrow from the night is 

00:03:31.690 --> 00:03:33.730
 when they enter certain and will sleep better 

00:03:33.730 --> 00:03:36.230
 but we still have maximum tomorrow that there may be 

00:03:36.230 --> 00:03:40.300
 in reaching it and up to 39 degrees in points of the ebro depression 

00:03:40.300 --> 00:03:44.210
 and we will have in the following days a decrease in temperatures as we have 

00:03:44.210 --> 00:03:47.049
 already announced on Friday important concert 

00:03:47.049 --> 00:03:50.730
 and with some shower early in the morning mainly in the Pyrenees 

00:03:50.730 --> 00:03:54.849
 already on Saturday and Sunday temperatures recover on all Sunday 

00:03:54.849 --> 00:03:58.150
 We will go back to heat but not as much as these days 

00:03:59.609 --> 00:04:02.919
 - seen photographs in the course of the newsletter we usually 

00:04:02.919 --> 00:04:04.090
 we say goodbye with them 

00:04:04.090 --> 00:04:07.599
 Today we have seen them at the beginning of this fire, we hope they keep sending 

00:04:07.599 --> 00:04:08.459
 weapons 

00:04:08.459 --> 00:04:11.459
 it has been all good afternoon 

00:04:12.699 --> 00:04:14.349
