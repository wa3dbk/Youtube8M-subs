demo video in today's demo we're gonna
be<00:00:09.570> looking<00:00:09.870> at<00:00:10.020> two<00:00:10.440> really<00:00:10.740> cool<00:00:10.860> functions

00:00:11.390 --> 00:00:11.400 
be looking at two really cool functions

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:13.070 
be looking at two really cool functions
from<00:00:11.580> a<00:00:11.670> song<00:00:11.940> search<00:00:12.240> and<00:00:12.420> the<00:00:12.540> first<00:00:12.780> is<00:00:12.900> the

00:00:13.070 --> 00:00:13.080 
from a song search and the first is the

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:16.129 
from a song search and the first is the
sniffer<00:00:13.349> function<00:00:13.889> and<00:00:14.070> the<00:00:14.760> second<00:00:15.179> is<00:00:15.330> the

00:00:16.129 --> 00:00:16.139 
sniffer function and the second is the

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:19.070 
sniffer function and the second is the
loop<00:00:16.380> function<00:00:16.880> so<00:00:17.880> before<00:00:18.150> we<00:00:18.240> begin<00:00:18.360> you'll

00:00:19.070 --> 00:00:19.080 
loop function so before we begin you'll

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:21.890 
loop function so before we begin you'll
see<00:00:19.259> I've<00:00:19.380> loaded<00:00:19.650> in<00:00:20.180> an<00:00:21.180> audio<00:00:21.480> track<00:00:21.750> in

00:00:24.830 --> 00:00:24.840 
audio track and I used the sniffer and

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:26.389 
audio track and I used the sniffer and
I'll<00:00:25.290> walk<00:00:25.439> you<00:00:25.560> through<00:00:25.739> how<00:00:25.770> I<00:00:25.860> did<00:00:26.099> that<00:00:26.250> it

a loop over a lick that then will you

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:16.880 
a loop over a lick that then will you

know then you can rerun that bad loop
over<00:01:17.130> and<00:01:17.220> over<00:01:17.399> again<00:01:17.490> you<00:01:17.790> can<00:01:17.939> slow<00:01:18.119> it<00:01:18.149> down

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:18.270 
over and over again you can slow it down

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:19.999 
over and over again you can slow it down
or<00:01:18.450> speed<00:01:18.780> it<00:01:19.020> up<00:01:19.140> you<00:01:19.320> can<00:01:19.439> adjust<00:01:19.740> the<00:01:19.860> pitch

00:01:19.999 --> 00:01:20.009 
or speed it up you can adjust the pitch

00:01:22.999 --> 00:01:23.009 
they're just these loop functions down

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:25.399 
they're just these loop functions down
here<00:01:23.280> in<00:01:23.340> the<00:01:23.579> corner<00:01:23.939> and<00:01:24.270> after<00:01:25.079> you<00:01:25.170> press

when you want the loop to stop you click
end<00:01:31.369> and<00:01:32.369> from<00:01:32.549> there<00:01:32.789> you<00:01:33.000> can<00:01:33.119> just<00:01:33.240> loop

00:01:33.499 --> 00:01:33.509 
end and from there you can just loop

00:01:33.509 --> 00:01:35.300 
end and from there you can just loop
that<00:01:34.079> one<00:01:34.289> little<00:01:34.530> section<00:01:35.009> that<00:01:35.039> you've

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:35.310 
that one little section that you've

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:37.639 
that one little section that you've
highlighted<00:01:35.579> so<00:01:36.479> I'll<00:01:36.689> press<00:01:36.899> play<00:01:37.200> and<00:01:37.439> then

00:01:37.639 --> 00:01:37.649 
highlighted so I'll press play and then

00:01:37.649 --> 00:01:38.929 
highlighted so I'll press play and then
I'm<00:01:37.890> going<00:01:38.039> to<00:01:38.130> start<00:01:38.490> the<00:01:38.579> loop<00:01:38.700> at<00:01:38.880> the

00:01:38.929 --> 00:01:38.939 
I'm going to start the loop at the

00:01:38.939 --> 00:01:40.340 
I'm going to start the loop at the
beginning<00:01:39.299> of<00:01:39.390> a<00:01:39.479> lick<00:01:39.689> and<00:01:39.719> I'll<00:01:39.960> end<00:01:40.140> it<00:01:40.200> at

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:40.350 
beginning of a lick and I'll end it at

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:53.400 
beginning of a lick and I'll end it at
the<00:01:40.439> beginning<00:01:40.799> at<00:01:41.189> the<00:01:41.250> end<00:01:41.340> of<00:01:41.579> a<00:01:41.820> lick

00:01:53.400 --> 00:01:53.410 

00:01:53.410 --> 00:01:56.110 

so<00:01:54.410> you<00:01:54.500> could<00:01:54.650> hear<00:01:54.980> there<00:01:55.160> and<00:01:55.430> see<00:01:55.670> I<00:01:55.700> just

00:01:56.110 --> 00:01:56.120 
so you could hear there and see I just

00:01:56.120 --> 00:01:57.490 
so you could hear there and see I just
looped<00:01:56.330> that<00:01:56.510> one<00:01:56.660> little<00:01:56.870> phrase<00:01:57.140> she<00:01:57.350> did

00:01:57.490 --> 00:01:57.500 
looped that one little phrase she did

00:01:57.500 --> 00:01:59.350 
looped that one little phrase she did
kind<00:01:57.740> of<00:01:57.770> at<00:01:57.860> the<00:01:57.950> end<00:01:58.040> of<00:01:58.250> the<00:01:58.940> 12<00:01:59.150> bar<00:01:59.330> blues

00:01:59.350 --> 00:01:59.360 
kind of at the end of the 12 bar blues

00:01:59.360 --> 00:02:01.840 
kind of at the end of the 12 bar blues
that<00:01:59.780> she's<00:01:59.960> playing<00:02:00.290> so<00:02:01.250> now<00:02:01.400> we<00:02:01.460> can<00:02:01.700> go<00:02:01.820> back

00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:01.850 
that she's playing so now we can go back

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:03.130 
that she's playing so now we can go back
and<00:02:02.120> we<00:02:02.180> can<00:02:02.210> listen<00:02:02.540> to<00:02:02.660> it<00:02:02.780> something<00:02:02.930> to

00:02:03.130 --> 00:02:03.140 
and we can listen to it something to

00:02:03.140 --> 00:02:06.969 
and we can listen to it something to
adjust<00:02:03.790> the<00:02:04.790> location<00:02:04.970> of<00:02:05.570> my<00:02:05.780> position<00:02:06.680> here

00:02:06.969 --> 00:02:06.979 
adjust the location of my position here

00:02:06.979 --> 00:02:08.680 
adjust the location of my position here
and<00:02:07.130> you<00:02:07.280> can<00:02:07.400> do<00:02:07.490> that<00:02:07.610> with<00:02:07.700> a<00:02:07.729> little<00:02:07.940> scan

00:02:08.680 --> 00:02:08.690 
and you can do that with a little scan

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:11.290 
and you can do that with a little scan
of<00:02:08.840> the<00:02:08.899> little<00:02:09.850> icon<00:02:10.850> like<00:02:11.000> that<00:02:11.120> you<00:02:11.180> can

00:02:11.290 --> 00:02:11.300 
of the little icon like that you can

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:12.790 
of the little icon like that you can
drag<00:02:11.420> across<00:02:11.600> the<00:02:11.780> bottom<00:02:12.050> here<00:02:12.230> to<00:02:12.260> start<00:02:12.680> and

00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:12.800 
drag across the bottom here to start and

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:14.710 
drag across the bottom here to start and
stop<00:02:12.980> at<00:02:13.130> different<00:02:13.160> parts<00:02:13.550> of<00:02:13.670> the<00:02:13.820> song<00:02:14.030> and

00:02:14.710 --> 00:02:14.720 
stop at different parts of the song and

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:16.510 
stop at different parts of the song and
I'll<00:02:15.080> start<00:02:15.380> I'll<00:02:15.500> start<00:02:15.710> it<00:02:15.920> just<00:02:15.950> in<00:02:16.220> the

00:02:16.510 --> 00:02:16.520 
I'll start I'll start it just in the

00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:17.980 
I'll start I'll start it just in the
loop<00:02:16.730> there<00:02:17.000> and<00:02:17.210> then<00:02:17.330> it<00:02:17.450> should<00:02:17.630> just<00:02:17.690> loop

00:02:17.980 --> 00:02:17.990 
loop there and then it should just loop

00:02:17.990 --> 00:02:30.610 
loop there and then it should just loop
around<00:02:18.110> itself<00:02:18.560> now<00:02:28.120> and<00:02:29.230> you<00:02:30.230> can<00:02:30.320> keep<00:02:30.470> going

00:02:30.610 --> 00:02:30.620 
around itself now and you can keep going

00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:32.290 
around itself now and you can keep going
and<00:02:30.830> loop<00:02:30.980> it<00:02:31.100> for<00:02:31.250> as<00:02:31.370> long<00:02:31.550> as<00:02:31.700> you<00:02:31.850> want<00:02:32.090> as

00:02:32.290 --> 00:02:32.300 
and loop it for as long as you want as

00:02:32.300 --> 00:02:34.390 
and loop it for as long as you want as
well<00:02:33.230> you<00:02:33.440> can<00:02:33.560> adjust<00:02:33.860> the<00:02:33.950> tempo<00:02:34.280> of<00:02:34.370> the

00:02:34.390 --> 00:02:34.400 
well you can adjust the tempo of the

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:36.010 
well you can adjust the tempo of the
loop<00:02:34.640> so<00:02:34.670> say<00:02:34.970> you<00:02:35.030> want<00:02:35.270> to<00:02:35.420> learn<00:02:35.570> that<00:02:35.750> lick

00:02:36.010 --> 00:02:36.020 
loop so say you want to learn that lick

00:02:36.020 --> 00:02:37.570 
loop so say you want to learn that lick
and<00:02:36.260> it<00:02:36.680> was<00:02:36.770> giving<00:02:36.950> you<00:02:37.010> some<00:02:37.130> trouble

00:02:37.570 --> 00:02:37.580 
and it was giving you some trouble

00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:40.960 
and it was giving you some trouble
you<00:02:38.180> can<00:02:38.330> click<00:02:38.540> say<00:02:38.780> 75%<00:02:39.410> and<00:02:40.130> then<00:02:40.730> press

00:02:40.960 --> 00:02:40.970 
you can click say 75% and then press

00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:43.030 
you can click say 75% and then press
play<00:02:41.000> and<00:02:41.450> then<00:02:41.570> it'll<00:02:41.720> play<00:02:42.500> the<00:02:42.620> loop<00:02:42.800> again

00:02:43.030 --> 00:02:43.040 
play and then it'll play the loop again

00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:44.890 
play and then it'll play the loop again
for<00:02:43.340> you<00:02:43.430> as<00:02:43.640> many<00:02:43.880> times<00:02:43.940> as<00:02:44.300> you<00:02:44.450> want

00:02:44.890 --> 00:02:44.900 
for you as many times as you want

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:47.440 
for you as many times as you want
only<00:02:45.440> now<00:02:45.560> it'll<00:02:45.800> be<00:02:45.830> at<00:02:45.980> 75%<00:02:46.459> of<00:02:46.910> the<00:02:47.000> original

00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:47.450 
only now it'll be at 75% of the original

00:02:47.450 --> 00:03:02.150 
only now it'll be at 75% of the original
tempo

00:03:02.150 --> 00:03:02.160 

00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:04.560 

so<00:03:03.160> you<00:03:03.250> can<00:03:03.370> see<00:03:03.490> how<00:03:03.640> easy<00:03:03.880> that<00:03:04.000> was<00:03:04.300> it<00:03:04.480> was

00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:04.570 
so you can see how easy that was it was

00:03:04.570 --> 00:03:06.060 
so you can see how easy that was it was
just<00:03:04.690> one<00:03:04.900> button<00:03:05.200> here<00:03:05.230> to<00:03:05.530> start<00:03:05.800> the<00:03:05.920> loop

00:03:06.060 --> 00:03:06.070 
just one button here to start the loop

00:03:06.070 --> 00:03:08.310 
just one button here to start the loop
one<00:03:06.850> button<00:03:07.180> to<00:03:07.300> end<00:03:07.450> the<00:03:07.570> loop<00:03:07.810> and<00:03:07.990> then<00:03:08.260> I

00:03:08.310 --> 00:03:08.320 
one button to end the loop and then I

00:03:08.320 --> 00:03:10.550 
one button to end the loop and then I
could<00:03:08.470> do<00:03:08.920> my<00:03:09.040> tempo<00:03:09.400> adjustments<00:03:09.940> down<00:03:10.120> here

00:03:10.550 --> 00:03:10.560 
could do my tempo adjustments down here

00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:12.960 
could do my tempo adjustments down here
as<00:03:11.560> well<00:03:11.770> you<00:03:11.890> can<00:03:12.010> set<00:03:12.160> multiple<00:03:12.340> loops<00:03:12.760> if

00:03:12.960 --> 00:03:12.970 
as well you can set multiple loops if

00:03:12.970 --> 00:03:14.220 
as well you can set multiple loops if
you<00:03:13.060> wanted<00:03:13.300> to<00:03:13.480> so<00:03:13.660> if<00:03:13.750> I<00:03:13.810> just<00:03:13.990> move<00:03:14.200> my

00:03:14.220 --> 00:03:14.230 
you wanted to so if I just move my

00:03:14.230 --> 00:03:15.780 
you wanted to so if I just move my
little<00:03:14.710> scanner<00:03:15.040> over<00:03:15.340> here

00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:15.790 
little scanner over here

00:03:15.790 --> 00:03:18.150 
little scanner over here
I'll<00:03:16.330> press<00:03:16.630> play<00:03:16.660> again<00:03:16.960> and<00:03:17.560> then<00:03:17.710> I<00:03:17.920> will

00:03:18.150 --> 00:03:18.160 
I'll press play again and then I will

00:03:18.160 --> 00:03:20.430 
I'll press play again and then I will
set<00:03:18.700> a<00:03:18.760> second<00:03:19.180> loop<00:03:19.330> using<00:03:19.750> the<00:03:19.930> exact<00:03:20.230> same

00:03:20.430 --> 00:03:20.440 
set a second loop using the exact same

00:03:20.440 --> 00:03:32.700 
set a second loop using the exact same
process<00:03:29.790> and<00:03:31.080> there<00:03:32.080> you<00:03:32.260> can<00:03:32.380> hear<00:03:32.530> that<00:03:32.650> I

00:03:32.700 --> 00:03:32.710 
process and there you can hear that I

00:03:32.710 --> 00:03:34.530 
process and there you can hear that I
did<00:03:33.100> a<00:03:33.160> much<00:03:33.340> shorter<00:03:33.550> lick<00:03:33.850> so<00:03:34.030> let's<00:03:34.180> go<00:03:34.330> back

00:03:34.530 --> 00:03:34.540 
did a much shorter lick so let's go back

00:03:34.540 --> 00:03:37.530 
did a much shorter lick so let's go back
and<00:03:34.840> we<00:03:35.410> will<00:03:35.620> listen<00:03:36.280> to<00:03:36.490> this<00:03:36.790> lick<00:03:37.090> now<00:03:37.270> on

00:03:37.530 --> 00:03:37.540 
and we will listen to this lick now on

00:03:37.540 --> 00:03:51.000 
and we will listen to this lick now on
loop<00:03:47.850> and<00:03:49.170> that's<00:03:50.170> it<00:03:50.440> and<00:03:50.560> you<00:03:50.620> can<00:03:50.740> create<00:03:50.860> as

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:51.010 
loop and that's it and you can create as

00:03:51.010 --> 00:03:52.710 
loop and that's it and you can create as
many<00:03:51.040> loops<00:03:51.460> as<00:03:51.610> you<00:03:51.760> want<00:03:52.030> and<00:03:52.210> you<00:03:52.270> can<00:03:52.450> slow

00:03:52.710 --> 00:03:52.720 
many loops as you want and you can slow

00:03:52.720 --> 00:03:54.270 
many loops as you want and you can slow
down<00:03:52.750> the<00:03:53.110> different<00:03:53.440> loops<00:03:53.620> you<00:03:53.800> can<00:03:53.950> adjust

00:03:54.270 --> 00:03:54.280 
down the different loops you can adjust

00:03:54.280 --> 00:03:55.800 
down the different loops you can adjust
the<00:03:54.400> pitch<00:03:54.580> with<00:03:54.790> the<00:03:54.880> pitch<00:03:55.060> adjuster<00:03:55.600> you

00:03:55.800 --> 00:03:55.810 
the pitch with the pitch adjuster you
