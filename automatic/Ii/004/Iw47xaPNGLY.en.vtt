00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:13.030
 you want to save on labor costs 

00:00:10.840 --> 00:00:15.459
 open a factory in albania you want 

00:00:13.030 --> 00:00:16.660
 find an anticancer drug that you don't 

00:00:15.459 --> 00:00:19.119
 sells in Italy 

00:00:16.660 --> 00:00:20.949
 well you find it in Albania once 

00:00:19.119 --> 00:00:22.600
 the opposite happened 

00:00:20.949 --> 00:00:25.720
 they were the Albanians who watched 

00:00:22.600 --> 00:00:27.820
 to Italy as to the Eldorado we talk about 

00:00:25.720 --> 00:00:30.340
 20 years ago not by much 

00:00:27.820 --> 00:00:33.370
 in twenty years the relationship practically yes 

00:00:30.340 --> 00:00:35.230
 it's almost turned upside down twenty years ago 

00:00:33.370 --> 00:00:38.739
 Albania had hospitals that didn't 

00:00:35.230 --> 00:00:41.980
 even reached the standars of the 

00:00:38.739 --> 00:00:43.359
 standard of our bad ready 

00:00:41.980 --> 00:00:46.120
 rescue 

00:00:43.359 --> 00:00:48.539
 now our kids are going to Albania 

00:00:46.120 --> 00:00:52.920
 to study medicine 

00:00:48.539 --> 00:00:55.390
 even there they opened up 

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:57.609
 university medical faculty 

00:00:55.390 --> 00:00:59.079
 also there to study medicine 

00:00:57.609 --> 00:01:03.190
 accessed by competition 

00:00:59.079 --> 00:01:06.490
 the infamous admission tests however i 

00:01:03.190 --> 00:01:09.040
 there are many more places available 

00:01:06.490 --> 00:01:10.060
 registration links much more 

00:01:09.040 --> 00:01:13.420
 wide 

00:01:10.060 --> 00:01:16.030
 yes that almost 600 aspiring doctors e 

00:01:13.420 --> 00:01:17.740
 dentists who have not passed the tests 

00:01:16.030 --> 00:01:19.720
 in Italy 

00:01:17.740 --> 00:01:22.840
 the other day they showed up at 

00:01:19.720 --> 00:01:26.470
 tirana with the same credentials but 

00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:29.820
 many more certainties of being able to do it but 

00:01:26.470 --> 00:01:33.700
 the beauty is not this if they will be admitted 

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:37.270
 they will study there they will graduate there 

00:01:33.700 --> 00:01:39.280
 albania but they can practice in italy 

00:01:37.270 --> 00:01:42.400
 because the faculty of medicine is 

00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:46.750
 tirana and italian dentistry e 

00:01:42.400 --> 00:01:49.080
 issues an Italian and Italian degree 

00:01:46.750 --> 00:01:52.750
 in that faculty it is practically everything 

00:01:49.080 --> 00:01:55.830
 the professors the students 

00:01:52.750 --> 00:01:58.510
 equipment is spoken Italian 

00:01:55.830 --> 00:02:01.360
 now while we just need a moment 

00:01:58.510 --> 00:02:03.490
 distraction during the test because 

00:02:01.360 --> 00:02:06.070
 thousands of kids see the 

00:02:03.490 --> 00:02:09.039
 their dream of being a doctor on 

00:02:06.070 --> 00:02:12.159
 doctor or also because the rules and the 

00:02:09.039 --> 00:02:15.220
 let's say a little 

00:02:12.159 --> 00:02:18.130
 questionable capotics but what does it do? 

00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:19.810
 takes advantage of these typical inconsistencies 

00:02:18.130 --> 00:02:22.510
 Italian and enhances them 

00:02:19.810 --> 00:02:23.739
 in short, they teach us to their advantage 

00:02:22.510 --> 00:02:26.950
 how to do 

00:02:23.739 --> 00:02:29.620
 and now in virtually all fields 

00:02:26.950 --> 00:02:32.319
 we should learn from them now 

00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:35.940
 indeed we should even say thank you 

00:02:32.319 --> 00:02:35.940
 thank goodness there are Albanians
