00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:55.500 
little so for example let's do this to

00:01:55.500 --> 00:02:03.650 
little so for example let's do this to
our<00:01:55.620> ball<00:02:00.530> tip<00:02:01.530> three<00:02:02.100> tip<00:02:02.850> number<00:02:03.030> three<00:02:03.480> is

our ball tip three tip number three is

00:02:03.660 --> 00:02:07.780 
our ball tip three tip number three is
going<00:02:04.500> to<00:02:04.740> be<00:02:05.730> to<00:02:06.030> always<00:02:06.420> use<00:02:06.750> drop<00:02:07.410> shadow

00:02:07.780 --> 00:02:07.790 
going to be to always use drop shadow

00:02:07.790 --> 00:02:10.670

it's<00:02:08.790> really<00:02:09.090> easy<00:02:09.270> to<00:02:09.390> apply<00:02:09.780> you<00:02:10.290> can<00:02:10.320> just

00:02:10.670 --> 00:02:10.680 
it's really easy to apply you can just

00:02:10.680 --> 00:02:13.640 
it's really easy to apply you can just
go<00:02:10.860> to<00:02:10.920> effects<00:02:11.610> perspective<00:02:12.480> drop<00:02:13.350> shadow

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:13.650 
go to effects perspective drop shadow

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:16.490 
go to effects perspective drop shadow
and<00:02:14.010> drag<00:02:14.910> that<00:02:14.940> on<00:02:15.330> to<00:02:15.510> any<00:02:15.690> layers<00:02:16.020> you

00:02:16.490 --> 00:02:16.500 
and drag that on to any layers you

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:19.940 
and drag that on to any layers you
choose<00:02:17.690> drop<00:02:18.690> shadow<00:02:18.720> really<00:02:19.230> adds<00:02:19.530> you<00:02:19.890> know

00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:19.950 
choose drop shadow really adds you know

00:02:19.950 --> 00:02:24.470 
choose drop shadow really adds you know
that<00:02:20.600> depth<00:02:21.600> and<00:02:21.810> separation<00:02:22.590> that<00:02:23.480> really

00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:24.480 
that depth and separation that really

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:29.900 
that depth and separation that really

would<00:02:30.209> be<00:02:30.270> to<00:02:30.780> always<00:02:31.110> use<00:02:31.410> motion<00:02:31.860> blur

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:32.010 
would be to always use motion blur

product let's look at the circle with a

00:03:06.330 --> 00:03:09.510 
product let's look at the circle with a
little<00:03:06.720> motion<00:03:06.959> blur<00:03:07.350> applied

00:03:09.510 --> 00:03:09.520

ah<00:03:13.110> my<00:03:14.110> final<00:03:14.500> tip<00:03:14.680> is<00:03:14.890> about<00:03:15.370> organization

00:03:16.340 --> 00:03:16.350 
ah my final tip is about organization

00:03:16.350 --> 00:03:19.890 
ah my final tip is about organization
now<00:03:17.350> it's<00:03:17.890> very<00:03:18.340> easy<00:03:18.460> to<00:03:18.790> get<00:03:19.030> unorganized

00:03:19.890 --> 00:03:19.900 
now it's very easy to get unorganized

00:03:19.900 --> 00:03:21.870 
now it's very easy to get unorganized
when<00:03:20.230> creating<00:03:20.560> a<00:03:20.800> motion<00:03:20.980> graphics<00:03:21.520> video

00:03:21.870 --> 00:03:21.880 
when creating a motion graphics video

00:03:21.880 --> 00:03:24.230 
when creating a motion graphics video
you<00:03:22.300> have<00:03:22.420> multiple<00:03:22.900> shape<00:03:23.200> layers

00:03:24.230 --> 00:03:24.240 
you have multiple shape layers

00:03:24.240 --> 00:03:26.700 
you have multiple shape layers
backgrounds<00:03:25.240> maybe<00:03:25.660> a<00:03:25.780> camera<00:03:26.140> in<00:03:26.380> there<00:03:26.560> and

00:03:26.700 --> 00:03:26.710 
backgrounds maybe a camera in there and

00:03:26.710 --> 00:03:29.070 
backgrounds maybe a camera in there and
all<00:03:26.830> objects<00:03:27.390> whatever<00:03:28.390> you<00:03:28.570> can<00:03:28.690> think<00:03:28.930> of

00:03:29.070 --> 00:03:29.080 
all objects whatever you can think of

00:03:29.080 --> 00:03:31.620 
all objects whatever you can think of
the<00:03:30.040> best<00:03:30.250> way<00:03:30.490> I<00:03:30.520> could<00:03:30.730> say<00:03:31.060> to<00:03:31.120> stay

00:03:31.620 --> 00:03:31.630 
the best way I could say to stay

00:03:31.630 --> 00:03:34.320 
the best way I could say to stay
organized<00:03:32.140> is<00:03:32.470> to<00:03:32.710> put<00:03:33.030> say<00:03:34.030> you<00:03:34.090> have<00:03:34.300> a

00:03:34.320 --> 00:03:34.330 
organized is to put say you have a

00:03:34.330 --> 00:03:36.690 
organized is to put say you have a
school<00:03:34.750> like<00:03:35.440> a<00:03:35.470> graphic<00:03:36.190> of<00:03:36.310> a<00:03:36.400> school

00:03:36.690 --> 00:03:36.700 
school like a graphic of a school

00:03:36.700 --> 00:03:39.810 
school like a graphic of a school
because<00:03:37.120> you're<00:03:37.390> making<00:03:38.460> motion<00:03:39.460> graphics

00:03:39.810 --> 00:03:39.820 
because you're making motion graphics

00:03:39.820 --> 00:03:41.730 
because you're making motion graphics
video<00:03:39.940> for<00:03:40.300> a<00:03:40.330> club<00:03:40.600> and<00:03:40.810> you<00:03:41.170> need<00:03:41.350> a<00:03:41.380> school

00:03:41.730 --> 00:03:41.740 
video for a club and you need a school

00:03:41.740 --> 00:03:43.800 
video for a club and you need a school
graphic<00:03:42.100> in<00:03:42.250> there<00:03:42.400> make<00:03:42.970> your<00:03:43.120> school<00:03:43.540> you

00:03:43.800 --> 00:03:43.810 
graphic in there make your school you

00:03:43.810 --> 00:03:46.170 
graphic in there make your school you
you<00:03:43.990> know<00:03:44.110> using<00:03:44.680> many<00:03:45.070> shape<00:03:45.610> layers<00:03:45.940> to

00:03:46.170 --> 00:03:46.180 
you know using many shape layers to

00:03:46.180 --> 00:03:49.290 
you know using many shape layers to
create<00:03:46.300> that<00:03:46.540> school<00:03:47.020> make<00:03:47.890> that<00:03:48.130> school<00:03:48.550> in<00:03:48.820> a
