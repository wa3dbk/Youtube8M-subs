what<00:00:02.700> we<00:00:02.820> have<00:00:02.970> here<00:00:03.179> is<00:00:03.360> a<00:00:03.389> tactic<00:00:03.840> 240<00:00:05.779> TTX

00:00:06.769 --> 00:00:06.779 
what we have here is a tactic 240 TTX

gigahertz<00:00:11.210> like<00:00:12.210> to<00:00:12.360> see<00:00:12.509> here<00:00:12.809> that<00:00:13.469> it

00:00:13.580 --> 00:00:13.590 
gigahertz like to see here that it

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:15.650 
gigahertz like to see here that it
doesn't<00:00:13.799> have<00:00:13.889> a<00:00:13.920> super<00:00:14.190> -<00:00:14.429> metal<00:00:15.299> antennas

doesn't have a super - metal antennas

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:20.060 
doesn't have a super - metal antennas
because<00:00:15.870> it<00:00:16.080> is<00:00:16.230> not<00:00:16.650> an<00:00:17.190> AM<00:00:18.090> transmitter<00:00:19.070> so

00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:20.070 
because it is not an AM transmitter so

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:21.140 
because it is not an AM transmitter so
you<00:00:20.160> don't<00:00:20.279> have<00:00:20.340> to<00:00:20.430> worry<00:00:20.580> about<00:00:20.640> breaking

00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:21.150

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:07.080 
steering great the steering rate pretty

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:10.880 
steering great the steering rate pretty
much<00:01:07.290> is<00:01:07.580> the<00:01:08.580> control<00:01:09.030> over<00:01:09.470> how<00:01:10.470> much<00:01:10.680> the

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:10.890 
much is the control over how much the

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:14.840 
much is the control over how much the
truck<00:01:11.159> will<00:01:11.610> turn<00:01:11.850> a<00:01:11.880> full<00:01:12.360> turn<00:01:13.549> so<00:01:14.549> if<00:01:14.700> you're

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:14.850 
truck will turn a full turn so if you're

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:16.520 
truck will turn a full turn so if you're
doing<00:01:15.119> high-speed<00:01:15.509> races<00:01:15.840> you're<00:01:16.140> gonna<00:01:16.320> want

doing high-speed races you're gonna want

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:18.560 
doing high-speed races you're gonna want
to<00:01:16.560> turn<00:01:16.710> it<00:01:16.830> down<00:01:16.860> low<00:01:17.159> see<00:01:18.030> you<00:01:18.119> spin<00:01:18.450> your

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:18.570 
to turn it down low see you spin your

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:20.390 
to turn it down low see you spin your
truck<00:01:18.810> out<00:01:18.990> and<00:01:19.229> you<00:01:19.770> can<00:01:19.920> actually<00:01:20.009> turn<00:01:20.340> your

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:20.400 
truck out and you can actually turn your

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:22.550 
truck out and you can actually turn your
wheel<00:01:20.640> without<00:01:20.820> the<00:01:21.630> wheels<00:01:21.780> turning<00:01:22.110> all<00:01:22.380> the

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:22.560 
wheel without the wheels turning all the

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:26.660 
wheel without the wheels turning all the
way<00:01:22.590> through<00:01:24.080> so<00:01:25.080> that<00:01:25.110> is<00:01:25.350> the<00:01:25.710> 2.4<00:01:26.460> gigahertz

00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:26.670

and<00:01:32.280> thus<00:01:33.180> does<00:01:33.509> have<00:01:34.170> a<00:01:34.619> fail-safe<00:01:35.360> so<00:01:37.100> you

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:38.100 
and thus does have a fail-safe so you

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:40.660 
and thus does have a fail-safe so you
know<00:01:38.250> if<00:01:38.369> your<00:01:38.520> controller<00:01:39.150> goes<00:01:39.299> out<00:01:39.450> of

00:01:40.660 --> 00:01:40.670 
know if your controller goes out of

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:43.249 
know if your controller goes out of
boundaries<00:01:41.670> or<00:01:41.790> whatever<00:01:42.060> but<00:01:42.960> you<00:01:43.020> probably

00:01:43.249 --> 00:01:43.259 
boundaries or whatever but you probably

00:01:43.259 --> 00:01:45.410 
boundaries or whatever but you probably
won't<00:01:43.470> because<00:01:43.740> this<00:01:43.890> is<00:01:44.100> a<00:01:44.180> 2.4<00:01:45.180> gigahertz

00:01:45.410 --> 00:01:45.420 
won't because this is a 2.4 gigahertz

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:50.389 
won't because this is a 2.4 gigahertz
system<00:01:48.200> the<00:01:49.200> truck<00:01:49.439> will<00:01:49.590> put<00:01:49.799> on<00:01:49.920> the<00:01:50.250> brakes

00:01:50.389 --> 00:01:50.399 
system the truck will put on the brakes

00:01:50.399 --> 00:01:53.300 
system the truck will put on the brakes
and<00:01:51.079> software<00:01:52.079> that<00:01:52.290> is<00:01:52.409> programmable<00:01:53.070> -<00:01:53.280> I

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:53.310 
and software that is programmable - I

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:58.760 
and software that is programmable - I
believe<00:01:54.170> so<00:01:55.170> yep<00:01:56.090> that<00:01:57.090> is<00:01:57.299> the<00:01:57.509> TT<00:01:57.719> x<00:01:57.990> 240

00:01:58.760 --> 00:01:58.770 
believe so yep that is the TT x 240

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:01.690 
believe so yep that is the TT x 240
