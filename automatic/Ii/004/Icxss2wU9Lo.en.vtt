 and today I would like with my friend 

00:00:06.629 --> 00:00:11.630
 talk about what I left from the channels 

00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:14.429
 they have sex 

00:00:11.630 --> 00:00:16.859
 I left the channels they are like a hare 

00:00:14.429 --> 00:00:18.779
 youtube care and all that we 

00:00:16.859 --> 00:00:19.980
 just divided into channel 2 i created 

00:00:18.779 --> 00:00:22.350
 your channel 

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:24.840
 he stays amid zeki why so 

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:26.640
 happened because we won't be like that 

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:28.260
 it depends on each other 

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:31.769
 it is very often because of what we are 

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:34.079
 principle can be said diverged 1 

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:36.989
 it turned out to shoot another did not work 

00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:39.149
 it is necessary to have that matter in that matter took place 

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:42.930
 so in the end we didn't shoot at all 2 

00:00:39.149 --> 00:00:44.940
 weeks and more then went out nonsense and 

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:47.370
 channel and channel just empty we 

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:50.579

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:07.890
 is not it so I tried it, even today, 

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:11.869
 write myself but then I realized that without 

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:14.939
 it is not that it is not a cake yes yes 

00:01:11.869 --> 00:01:19.490

00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:17.010
 Naturally link in the description to my 

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:20.430
 Channel shorter giving giving talk about 

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:24.930
 how will it be like this 

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:28.380
 do n't shoot it I don't want to tell you 

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:31.410
 I shoot well okay and those who are watching 

00:02:28.380 --> 00:02:35.400
 at the very beginning of this channel i think 

00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:39.000
 such there is before we had it before 

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:42.090
 the channel had access to both he and me that is he 

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:47.880
 laid out his version of survival on 

00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:52.739
 I own my island but then to put it mildly I 

00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:56.010
 can be considered pressed channel in the sense 

00:02:52.739 --> 00:02:58.170
 what just put is good well shorter yes 

00:02:56.010 --> 00:03:00.989
 I changed the password and made it possible to consider 

00:02:58.170 --> 00:03:03.950
 ours but we laid our legs together 

00:03:00.989 --> 00:03:07.500
 together I laid out well, in short, you understand 

00:03:03.950 --> 00:03:09.810
 it will be the same now 

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:12.630
 it is his version will be laid to him and 

00:03:09.810 --> 00:03:16.610
 I have nothing important to me 

00:03:12.630 --> 00:03:19.370
 just two channels have changed and more 

00:03:16.610 --> 00:03:22.040
 and + new other vidos for other games 

00:03:19.370 --> 00:03:23.780
 by the way it seems to me a big plus then 

00:03:22.040 --> 00:03:24.470
 that we can shoot everything we want on 

00:03:23.780 --> 00:03:28.130
 own channels 

00:03:24.470 --> 00:03:30.470
 but you understand how we used to have 

00:03:28.130 --> 00:03:33.680
 before we had so here for example I will take off 

00:03:30.470 --> 00:03:36.650
 yak something game I want to take it off 

00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:38.630
 he doesn't like this game and he does 

00:03:36.650 --> 00:03:40.910
 against so that I laid out that is the channel 

00:03:38.630 --> 00:03:43.160
 that was the general thing, that is, we were 

00:03:40.910 --> 00:03:46.550
 limited to be sure to 

00:03:43.160 --> 00:03:48.830
 I liked both him and me, but now it will be like 

00:03:46.550 --> 00:03:51.440
 since we want to write 

00:03:48.830 --> 00:03:54.950
 what kind of game will i write and if i want 

00:03:51.440 --> 00:03:57.230
 lay out and he also yes yes yes that is nobody 

00:03:54.950 --> 00:03:59.630
 doesn't depend on anyone and do all that 

00:03:57.230 --> 00:04:06.080
 wants its channel by the way if you want 

00:03:59.630 --> 00:04:09.560
 you can shoot a video on the principle 

00:04:06.080 --> 00:04:13.610
 you can decide yourself somehow yes I think 

00:04:09.560 --> 00:04:18.200
 maybe five experience case can open 

00:04:13.610 --> 00:04:22.030
 10 cases of such horror and screw it up yes 

00:04:18.200 --> 00:04:25.490
 Today I already opened one case for chrome 2 

00:04:22.030 --> 00:04:28.419
 swore 50 turn on nothing good 

00:04:25.490 --> 00:04:31.850
 falls almost killed you 

00:04:28.419 --> 00:04:33.530
