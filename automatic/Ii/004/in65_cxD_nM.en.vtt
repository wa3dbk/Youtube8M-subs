fit in the Quattro or the DSG and this
Audi<00:03:28.700> Quattro<00:03:28.880> was<00:03:29.180> a<00:03:29.240> better<00:03:29.420> option<00:03:29.630> so<00:03:29.990> they

00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:30.410 
Audi Quattro was a better option so they

00:03:30.410 --> 00:03:31.600 
Audi Quattro was a better option so they
stuck<00:03:30.620> with<00:03:30.650> the<00:03:30.830> manual<00:03:31.100> and<00:03:31.190> I<00:03:31.340> think

00:03:31.600 --> 00:03:31.610 
stuck with the manual and I think

00:03:31.610 --> 00:03:33.340 
stuck with the manual and I think
sitting<00:03:32.180> in<00:03:32.270> the<00:03:32.360> s1<00:03:32.660> it's<00:03:32.900> a<00:03:32.960> really<00:03:33.230> nice

00:03:33.340 --> 00:03:33.350

00:04:46.570 --> 00:04:46.580 
about the driving dynamics of ds1 as I

00:04:46.580 --> 00:04:48.580 
about the driving dynamics of ds1 as I
said<00:04:46.790> before<00:04:46.940> before<00:04:47.870> I<00:04:47.900> took<00:04:48.020> off<00:04:48.290> that<00:04:48.440> is

00:04:48.580 --> 00:04:48.590 
said before before I took off that is

00:04:48.590 --> 00:04:50.770 
said before before I took off that is
the<00:04:49.130> S<00:04:49.280> one's<00:04:49.490> got<00:04:49.669> a<00:04:49.700> beautiful<00:04:50.270> engine<00:04:50.419> note

00:04:50.780 --> 00:04:52.210 
the S one's got a beautiful engine note
so<00:04:51.020> that's<00:04:51.260> piped<00:04:51.560> straight<00:04:51.919> through<00:04:52.100> the

00:04:52.210 --> 00:04:52.220 
so that's piped straight through the

00:04:52.220 --> 00:04:54.580 
so that's piped straight through the
four<00:04:52.490> quad<00:04:53.120> exhaust<00:04:53.389> I<00:04:53.810> should<00:04:53.960> say<00:04:54.139> sorry<00:04:54.350> and

00:04:54.580 --> 00:04:54.590 
four quad exhaust I should say sorry and

00:04:54.590 --> 00:04:58.210 
four quad exhaust I should say sorry and
as<00:04:54.950> I<00:04:55.040> said<00:04:55.100> it<00:04:55.610> is<00:04:55.760> manual<00:04:57.040> something<00:04:58.040> to<00:04:58.100> be

00:04:58.210 --> 00:04:58.220 
as I said it is manual something to be

00:04:58.220 --> 00:05:03.400 
as I said it is manual something to be
aware<00:04:58.370> of<00:04:58.430> I<00:04:58.760> guess<00:04:59.860> so<00:05:00.889> as<00:05:01.480> with<00:05:02.480> every<00:05:02.810> video

00:05:03.400 --> 00:05:03.410 
aware of I guess so as with every video

00:05:03.410 --> 00:05:05.590 
aware of I guess so as with every video
on<00:05:03.860> features<00:05:04.340> on<00:05:04.460> red<00:05:04.700> we're<00:05:05.210> gonna<00:05:05.360> talk

00:05:05.590 --> 00:05:05.600 
on features on red we're gonna talk

00:05:05.600 --> 00:05:07.690 
on features on red we're gonna talk
about<00:05:05.630> three<00:05:06.320> key<00:05:06.710> aspects<00:05:07.100> of<00:05:07.190> the<00:05:07.310> car

00:05:07.690 --> 00:05:07.700 
about three key aspects of the car

00:05:07.700 --> 00:05:10.690 
about three key aspects of the car
that's<00:05:07.940> performance<00:05:08.650> safety<00:05:09.650> and<00:05:09.860> livability

00:05:10.690 --> 00:05:10.700 
that's performance safety and livability

00:05:10.700 --> 00:05:12.640 
that's performance safety and livability
so<00:05:11.210> how<00:05:11.540> well<00:05:11.720> you<00:05:11.840> can<00:05:11.990> actually<00:05:12.139> live<00:05:12.500> with

00:05:12.640 --> 00:05:12.650 
so how well you can actually live with

00:05:12.650 --> 00:05:13.810 
so how well you can actually live with
the<00:05:12.770> car<00:05:12.950> everyday

00:05:13.810 --> 00:05:13.820 
the car everyday

00:05:13.820 --> 00:05:16.960 
the car everyday
so<00:05:14.419> the<00:05:15.050> first<00:05:15.320> strike<00:05:15.740> against<00:05:16.460> the<00:05:16.550> car<00:05:16.790> in

00:05:16.960 --> 00:05:16.970 
so the first strike against the car in

00:05:16.970 --> 00:05:18.370 
so the first strike against the car in
terms<00:05:17.180> of<00:05:17.270> livability<00:05:17.660> which<00:05:17.990> I<00:05:18.110> guess<00:05:18.260> we're

00:05:18.370 --> 00:05:18.380 
terms of livability which I guess we're

00:05:18.380 --> 00:05:19.570 
terms of livability which I guess we're
going<00:05:18.500> to<00:05:18.530> talk<00:05:18.680> about<00:05:18.800> first<00:05:19.130> thing<00:05:19.280> as<00:05:19.490> I

00:05:19.570 --> 00:05:19.580 
going to talk about first thing as I

because it is manual you're gonna have

00:05:23.270 --> 00:05:25.360 
because it is manual you're gonna have
to<00:05:23.360> keep<00:05:23.480> shifting<00:05:23.720> and<00:05:24.110> if<00:05:25.040> that's<00:05:25.280> not

00:05:25.360 --> 00:05:25.370 
to keep shifting and if that's not

00:05:25.370 --> 00:05:27.159 
to keep shifting and if that's not
something<00:05:25.490> you're<00:05:25.669> used<00:05:25.850> to<00:05:25.970> it's<00:05:26.330> gonna<00:05:26.600> get

00:05:33.670 --> 00:05:33.680 
you is all I have to say coupled with a

00:05:33.680 --> 00:05:36.490 
you is all I have to say coupled with a
DSG<00:05:34.130> gearbox<00:05:34.310> would<00:05:35.030> be<00:05:35.240> absolutely<00:05:35.930> amazing

00:05:36.490 --> 00:05:36.500 
DSG gearbox would be absolutely amazing

00:05:36.500 --> 00:05:37.930 
DSG gearbox would be absolutely amazing
but<00:05:36.950> maybe<00:05:37.340> that's<00:05:37.490> something<00:05:37.669> you<00:05:37.760> have<00:05:37.880> is

00:05:37.930 --> 00:05:37.940 
but maybe that's something you have is

00:05:37.940 --> 00:05:39.040 
but maybe that's something you have is
gonna<00:05:38.060> do<00:05:38.210> in<00:05:38.270> the<00:05:38.330> future<00:05:38.540> if<00:05:38.720> they<00:05:38.870> can

00:05:39.040 --> 00:05:39.050 
gonna do in the future if they can

00:05:39.050 --> 00:05:40.719 
gonna do in the future if they can
extend<00:05:39.860> the<00:05:39.979> wheelbase<00:05:40.280> a<00:05:40.340> bit

00:05:40.719 --> 00:05:40.729 
extend the wheelbase a bit

00:05:40.729 --> 00:05:42.520 
extend the wheelbase a bit
we<00:05:40.970> never<00:05:41.120> know<00:05:41.300> you<00:05:41.660> do<00:05:41.840> get<00:05:42.050> a<00:05:42.080> lot<00:05:42.200> of<00:05:42.320> get<00:05:42.440> up

00:05:42.520 --> 00:05:42.530 
we never know you do get a lot of get up

00:05:42.530 --> 00:05:44.350 
we never know you do get a lot of get up
and<00:05:42.680> go<00:05:42.800> and<00:05:43.040> that's<00:05:43.250> because<00:05:43.639> this<00:05:43.880> 2<00:05:44.120> liter

00:05:44.350 --> 00:05:44.360 
and go and that's because this 2 liter

00:05:44.360 --> 00:05:47.409 
and go and that's because this 2 liter
turbo<00:05:44.570> engine<00:05:44.660> is<00:05:45.160> absolutely<00:05:46.160> bonkers<00:05:46.419> it's
