 good first here I ask for you 

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:27.840
 is in the taste below is 

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:30.510
 sharing this right video lesson 

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:33.570
 well let's go guys on my computer 

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:36.030
 of the see where will be located around their 

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:37.230
 participations in the case your hd you see in 

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:39.180
 any part is ok 

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:42.210

 right tool 

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:51.329
 remembering here what is happening here 

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:54.600
 method is for windows 7 is also good 

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:57.510
 It's the only thing that changes is the word 

00:00:54.600 --> 00:01:00.660
 is here on windows 7 is different 

00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:05.040
 it's but it's the same the options there are good 

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:07.950
 You're going to stay here used right there. 

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:08.880
 appear good good service come on this 

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:11.340
 here it's right 

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:13.770
 you can optimize your units for 

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:16.560
 help with the computer being run 

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:19.799
 more efficiently or analyzed for 

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:22.320
 to know if it needs to be used only 

00:01:19.799 --> 00:01:23.790
 the units connected to or connected to your 

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:27.570
 computer was shown 

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:28.590
 good staff is what defragmentation is 

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:30.840
 huh 

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:34.680
 good is the personal defragmentation is 

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:38.759
 simply is is simply a 

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:40.790
 process of consolidation of data 

00:01:38.759 --> 00:01:43.520
 fragmented in volume 

00:01:40.790 --> 00:01:45.590
 is like a hard drive or a device 

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:48.380
 storage for it to work 

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:50.420
 more efficiently between staff 

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:52.910
 disk defragmenter is not a 

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:55.130
 tool that performs the data in the 

00:01:52.910 --> 00:01:56.540
 volume and gathers fragmented data to 

00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:59.270
 that the computer of the work of form 

00:01:56.540 --> 00:02:01.430
 more efficient, that's good, that's it 

00:01:59.270 --> 00:02:02.570
 will improve the performance of your 

00:02:01.430 --> 00:02:05.810
 computer is good 

00:02:02.570 --> 00:02:08.420
 well you go there that is in those units 

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:12.050
 here and will click here to review there 

00:02:08.420 --> 00:02:15.320
 You are sure he will do anything here O 0 

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:16.100
 fragmented is the unit reserved for 

00:02:15.320 --> 00:02:18.170
 the system 

00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:21.170
 Let's go here on the other disc in my other 

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:23.870
 Partition is right, let's look at it. 

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:26.950
 two fragmented files are okay let's 

00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:26.950
 here at this location c 

00:02:32.050 --> 00:02:38.090
 As you can see here, there's only one file. 

00:02:34.870 --> 00:02:41.989
 fragmented 

00:02:38.090 --> 00:02:45.110
 good is how to get here with this one you have 20 

00:02:41.989 --> 00:02:48.410
 and 15 11 is increased archiving goes 

00:02:45.110 --> 00:02:49.640
 here is a warning here for you 

00:02:48.410 --> 00:02:52.840
 said he was still right 

00:02:49.640 --> 00:03:00.549
 Okay, what you guys are going to do is 

00:02:52.840 --> 00:03:00.549
 a case you are not here on the drive 

00:03:00.670 --> 00:03:05.870
 is fragmented not clicking on it good 

00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:09.230
 here to optimize the right 

00:03:05.870 --> 00:03:12.049
 then you will be analyzing again and 

00:03:09.230 --> 00:03:15.049
 so on you are doing a process there goin ' 

00:03:12.049 --> 00:03:17.180
 console consolidation is certain that it 

00:03:15.049 --> 00:03:20.290
 will meet there right? 

00:03:17.180 --> 00:03:23.060
 the data fragmented tap making it there 

00:03:20.290 --> 00:03:25.400
 make speed is the performance there 

00:03:23.060 --> 00:03:27.080
 own software and athletes well 

00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:30.019
 faster personal hit 

00:03:27.080 --> 00:03:33.110
 so this is our first choice 

00:03:30.019 --> 00:03:35.750
 here is step by step such goes first 

00:03:33.110 --> 00:03:38.000
 step is step two step him 

00:03:35.750 --> 00:03:40.610
 It's going to be relocating so you do not 

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:42.680
 clicked the 5th right stop then as 

00:03:40.610 --> 00:03:45.140
 It will end there as normal. 

00:03:42.680 --> 00:03:48.290
 This is always going to be okay here. 

00:03:45.140 --> 00:03:50.629
 well you can see here 

00:03:48.290 --> 00:03:52.329
 It is to make a schedule is just right 

00:03:50.629 --> 00:03:56.329
 you go here to change settings 

00:03:52.329 --> 00:03:59.180
 It's good that you check these two options. 

00:03:56.329 --> 00:04:01.909
 here it is certain that the frequency is that 

00:03:59.180 --> 00:04:03.769
 you'll be available on your HD 

00:04:01.909 --> 00:04:06.099
 I leave weekly is right, it's just 

00:04:03.769 --> 00:04:09.349
 you choose here even monthly 

00:04:06.099 --> 00:04:11.510
 or daily I leave here 

00:04:09.349 --> 00:04:13.430
 weekly good here you can 

00:04:11.510 --> 00:04:15.319
 choose which part are you want 

00:04:13.430 --> 00:04:17.900
 This is going to work for me. 

00:04:15.319 --> 00:04:20.239
 good I was here everything this segment 

00:04:17.900 --> 00:04:22.490
 only I let everyone bookmarked you can 

00:04:20.239 --> 00:04:30.770
 choose the sun says put the cei 

00:04:22.490 --> 00:04:33.080
 ok ok lie right that's right as 

00:04:30.770 --> 00:04:35.270
 finish with a step and there it is 

00:04:33.080 --> 00:04:37.070
 now you are going to notice a 

00:04:35.270 --> 00:04:38.960
 huge difference is personal 

00:04:37.070 --> 00:04:42.590
 if you never did it there you will notice 

00:04:38.960 --> 00:04:45.590
 a huge difference in speed tav 

00:04:42.590 --> 00:04:48.470
 77 software is find things going 

00:04:45.590 --> 00:04:49.550
 get well faster then hit 

00:04:48.470 --> 00:04:51.470
