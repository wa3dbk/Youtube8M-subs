for<00:00:30.529> a<00:00:31.529> good<00:00:31.949> size<00:00:32.189> seed<00:00:32.489> go<00:00:32.790> in<00:00:33.030> and<00:00:35.809> it's<00:00:36.809> also

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:37.020 
for a good size seed go in and it's also

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:40.010 
for a good size seed go in and it's also
in<00:00:37.950> my<00:00:38.190> case<00:00:38.460> I'm<00:00:38.670> making<00:00:39.210> peppers<00:00:39.690> now<00:00:39.989> I

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:40.020 
in my case I'm making peppers now I

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:43.400 
in my case I'm making peppers now I
filmed<00:00:40.559> it<00:00:41.480> it's<00:00:42.480> that<00:00:42.600> little<00:00:42.750> line<00:00:43.020> right

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:43.410 
filmed it it's that little line right

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:44.799 
filmed it it's that little line right
there

00:00:44.799 --> 00:00:44.809 
there

00:00:44.809 --> 00:00:49.130 
there
so<00:00:45.809> it's<00:00:46.379> good<00:00:46.920> enough<00:00:47.070> for<00:00:47.129> me<00:00:47.370> I<00:00:48.140> think

00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:49.140 
so it's good enough for me I think

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:57.200 
so it's good enough for me I think

they feel kinda like a cupcake yeah I

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:15.289 
they feel kinda like a cupcake yeah I
use<00:01:13.170> regular<00:01:13.500> potting<00:01:13.710> soil<00:01:14.040> I<00:01:14.340> just<00:01:15.060> put<00:01:15.210> it

00:01:15.289 --> 00:01:15.299 
use regular potting soil I just put it

00:01:15.299 --> 00:01:17.300 
use regular potting soil I just put it
in<00:01:15.390> a<00:01:15.509> mesh<00:01:15.780> bag<00:01:15.990> and<00:01:16.439> sifted<00:01:16.890> it<00:01:16.979> into<00:01:17.189> the

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:17.310 
in a mesh bag and sifted it into the

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:24.469 
in a mesh bag and sifted it into the
bucket<00:01:17.460> and<00:01:20.600> the<00:01:21.600> amount<00:01:21.810> of<00:01:21.869> water<00:01:23.479> probably

00:01:24.469 --> 00:01:24.479 
bucket and the amount of water probably

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:35.620 
bucket and the amount of water probably
about<00:01:24.659> 2<00:01:25.140> cups<00:01:26.420> -<00:01:27.420> these<00:01:31.850> -<00:01:32.850> those<00:01:33.060> two<00:01:33.420> maybe

00:01:35.620 --> 00:01:35.630 

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:40.520 

once<00:01:36.630> a

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:40.530 

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:47.000 

five<00:01:41.400> cups<00:01:41.760> of<00:01:42.000> the<00:01:42.150> sifted<00:01:43.310> soil<00:01:45.740> and<00:01:46.740> then<00:01:46.950> I

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:47.010 
five cups of the sifted soil and then I

00:01:47.010 --> 00:01:58.190 
five cups of the sifted soil and then I
just<00:01:47.159> fold<00:01:47.340> it<00:01:47.580> in<00:01:47.670> with<00:01:55.009> anyway<00:01:56.040> yeah<00:01:57.200> the

00:01:58.190 --> 00:01:58.200 
just fold it in with anyway yeah the

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:00.770 
just fold it in with anyway yeah the
holes<00:01:58.500> I<00:01:58.890> did<00:01:59.040> not<00:01:59.430> eat<00:01:59.909> a<00:02:00.119> good<00:02:00.300> mix<00:02:00.720> for

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:00.780 
holes I did not eat a good mix for

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:03.980 
holes I did not eat a good mix for
cleaning<00:02:01.229> a<00:02:01.320> lot<00:02:01.470> I<00:02:02.149> had<00:02:03.149> to<00:02:03.270> bring<00:02:03.450> one<00:02:03.630> inside

00:02:03.980 --> 00:02:03.990 
cleaning a lot I had to bring one inside

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:07.999 
cleaning a lot I had to bring one inside
to<00:02:04.500> check<00:02:04.940> anyway<00:02:05.940> and<00:02:06.270> I<00:02:06.750> don't<00:02:06.810> often<00:02:07.200> either

00:02:07.999 --> 00:02:08.009 
to check anyway and I don't often either

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:10.910 
to check anyway and I don't often either
doing<00:02:08.399> there<00:02:08.700> the<00:02:09.140> benefits<00:02:10.140> of<00:02:10.319> soil<00:02:10.560> cubes

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:10.920 
doing there the benefits of soil cubes

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:15.650 
doing there the benefits of soil cubes
compared<00:02:11.310> to<00:02:13.250> regular<00:02:14.250> pots<00:02:14.670> for<00:02:15.239> see<00:02:15.390> things

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:15.660 
compared to regular pots for see things

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:18.380 
compared to regular pots for see things
off<00:02:16.530> the<00:02:16.709> top<00:02:16.890> of<00:02:16.920> my<00:02:17.010> head<00:02:17.280> you<00:02:18.030> probably
