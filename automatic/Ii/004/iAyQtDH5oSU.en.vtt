00:00:10.350 --> 00:00:15.610
 Hello to you, Mr. Guram you Merry

 see the program drag racing digest 

00:00:15.610 --> 00:00:19.060
 competitive spirit was inherent in man 

00:00:17.619 --> 00:00:21.550
 at all times 

00:00:19.060 --> 00:00:23.380
 so after the invention of the car 

00:00:21.550 --> 00:00:25.630
 conducting the first car race 

00:00:23.380 --> 00:00:27.700
 it was only a matter of time however 

00:00:25.630 --> 00:00:29.440
 sports disciplines in various parts 

00:00:27.700 --> 00:00:31.750
 light sometimes differed very, very 

00:00:29.440 --> 00:00:34.180
 cardinally for example Europe is always 

00:00:31.750 --> 00:00:36.370
 then the races and rally races 

00:00:34.180 --> 00:00:38.650
 like america with its new light and 

00:00:36.370 --> 00:00:40.150
 many faces right engines tried 

00:00:38.650 --> 00:00:42.730
 you can not simplify the task 

00:00:40.150 --> 00:00:45.370
 two cars the one who first crosses 

00:00:42.730 --> 00:00:47.409
 finish line takes money women well 

00:00:45.370 --> 00:00:49.690
 and of course elevated self-esteem 

00:00:47.409 --> 00:00:51.760
 Dragruising was born in America in the 30s 

00:00:49.690 --> 00:00:53.379
 years on salt lakes california 

00:00:51.760 --> 00:00:55.540
 due to its simplicity and 

00:00:53.379 --> 00:00:57.030
 uncomplicated yu he quickly found 

00:00:55.540 --> 00:00:59.589
 popularity across the continent 

00:00:57.030 --> 00:01:01.449
 the English word black literally 

00:00:59.589 --> 00:01:03.790
 translates as pull or drags that 

00:01:01.449 --> 00:01:05.860
 very poorly fit with the race but 

00:01:03.790 --> 00:01:08.440
 one of the versions was based on the phrase 

00:01:05.860 --> 00:01:09.610
 wind carfon tagirovich andrey media 

00:01:08.440 --> 00:01:11.799
 which means 

00:01:09.610 --> 00:01:14.320
 pull your car out of the garage and 

00:01:11.799 --> 00:01:16.930
 chase with me on a different version of the word 

00:01:14.320 --> 00:01:18.610
 jack was used as designation more 

00:01:16.930 --> 00:01:21.219
 late gear shift 

00:01:18.610 --> 00:01:23.170
 for optimum acceleration 

00:01:21.219 --> 00:01:25.539
 drag racing world can be roughly 

00:01:23.170 --> 00:01:27.430
 divided into 2 groups of professional and 

00:01:25.539 --> 00:01:29.020
