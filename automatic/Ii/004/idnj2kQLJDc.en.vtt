help mankind this is one of the ways but
there<00:01:46.039> are<00:01:46.159> other<00:01:46.310> ways<00:01:46.550> that<00:01:46.610> you<00:01:47.060> can<00:01:47.240> do

00:01:47.410 --> 00:01:47.420 
there are other ways that you can do

things<00:01:47.690> that<00:01:48.259> wiggle<00:01:48.740> the<00:01:48.860> branches<00:01:50.140> wiggle

00:01:51.130 --> 00:01:51.140 
things that wiggle the branches wiggle

00:01:51.140 --> 00:01:57.880 
things that wiggle the branches wiggle
the<00:01:51.289> branches<00:01:52.000> for<00:01:53.000> example<00:01:54.550> they<00:01:55.550> had<00:01:56.890> some

00:01:57.880 --> 00:01:57.890 
the branches for example they had some

00:01:57.890 --> 00:02:00.460 
the branches for example they had some
years<00:01:58.130> back<00:01:58.600> cattle<00:01:59.600> start<00:01:59.840> getting<00:02:00.140> sick

00:02:00.460 --> 00:02:00.470 
years back cattle start getting sick

00:02:00.470 --> 00:02:02.950 
years back cattle start getting sick
mostly<00:02:01.100> over<00:02:01.310> there<00:02:01.640> in<00:02:01.790> Europe<00:02:01.970> England<00:02:02.689> for

00:02:02.950 --> 00:02:02.960 
mostly over there in Europe England for

00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:06.039 
mostly over there in Europe England for
example<00:02:03.670> they<00:02:04.670> found<00:02:04.700> out<00:02:05.210> it<00:02:05.390> was<00:02:05.479> kind<00:02:05.720> of<00:02:05.899> a

00:02:06.039 --> 00:02:06.049 
example they found out it was kind of a

00:02:06.049 --> 00:02:10.270 
example they found out it was kind of a
mad<00:02:06.290> cow<00:02:06.890> disease<00:02:08.619> and<00:02:09.619> they<00:02:09.769> figured<00:02:10.130> out

00:02:10.270 --> 00:02:10.280 
mad cow disease and they figured out

00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:12.850 
mad cow disease and they figured out
finally<00:02:10.700> that<00:02:11.209> it<00:02:11.750> was<00:02:11.930> because<00:02:12.320> they<00:02:12.590> was

00:02:12.850 --> 00:02:12.860 
finally that it was because they was

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:14.979 
finally that it was because they was
taking<00:02:13.400> the<00:02:13.519> dead<00:02:13.700> cows<00:02:14.000> and<00:02:14.329> grind<00:02:14.630> them<00:02:14.810> up

00:02:16.569 --> 00:02:16.579 
and putting them in this pillar for the

00:02:16.579 --> 00:02:19.330

00:02:21.610 --> 00:02:21.620 
eaten cows and that's how they got mad

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:25.600

why well they take all those

00:02:58.590 --> 00:03:02.210 
why well they take all those
grasshoppers<00:02:58.950> and<00:02:59.790> they<00:03:00.780> would<00:03:01.019> put<00:03:01.980> them<00:03:02.099> in

00:03:02.210 --> 00:03:02.220 
grasshoppers and they would put them in

00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:05.540 
grasshoppers and they would put them in
a<00:03:02.280> deal<00:03:02.970> and<00:03:03.269> grind<00:03:03.599> them<00:03:03.810> up<00:03:04.160> mush<00:03:05.160> them<00:03:05.370> up

00:03:05.540 --> 00:03:05.550 
a deal and grind them up mush them up

00:03:05.550 --> 00:03:07.610 
a deal and grind them up mush them up
put<00:03:06.000> water<00:03:06.209> in<00:03:06.480> there<00:03:06.720> and<00:03:06.900> get<00:03:07.019> a<00:03:07.050> good<00:03:07.140> mush

00:03:07.610 --> 00:03:07.620 
put water in there and get a good mush

00:03:07.620 --> 00:03:11.150 
put water in there and get a good mush
of<00:03:07.890> maybe<00:03:08.129> a<00:03:08.250> hundred<00:03:08.489> 200<00:03:09.239> grasshoppers<00:03:10.160> now

00:03:11.150 --> 00:03:11.160 
of maybe a hundred 200 grasshoppers now

00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:12.770 
of maybe a hundred 200 grasshoppers now
why<00:03:11.370> do<00:03:11.430> you<00:03:11.610> do<00:03:11.790> things<00:03:12.060> like<00:03:12.299> that

00:03:12.770 --> 00:03:12.780 
why do you do things like that

00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:15.740 
why do you do things like that
well<00:03:13.700> because<00:03:14.700> you<00:03:14.879> can<00:03:15.030> figure<00:03:15.239> if<00:03:15.480> you<00:03:15.599> got

00:03:15.740 --> 00:03:15.750 
well because you can figure if you got

00:03:15.750 --> 00:03:17.690 
well because you can figure if you got
200<00:03:15.989> grasshoppers<00:03:16.890> probably<00:03:17.280> one<00:03:17.459> of<00:03:17.489> them's

00:03:17.690 --> 00:03:17.700 
200 grasshoppers probably one of them's

00:03:17.700 --> 00:03:21.380 
200 grasshoppers probably one of them's
got<00:03:17.910> a<00:03:17.940> disease<00:03:18.410> but<00:03:19.410> mushin<00:03:19.860> that<00:03:20.040> up<00:03:20.280> get<00:03:21.180> it

00:03:21.380 --> 00:03:21.390 
got a disease but mushin that up get it

00:03:21.390 --> 00:03:24.050 
got a disease but mushin that up get it
into<00:03:21.720> a<00:03:21.750> mush<00:03:22.110> if<00:03:22.440> you<00:03:22.590> will<00:03:22.799> into<00:03:23.670> a<00:03:23.700> liquid

00:03:24.050 --> 00:03:24.060 
into a mush if you will into a liquid

00:03:24.060 --> 00:03:27.080 
into a mush if you will into a liquid
semi<00:03:24.690> liquid<00:03:25.019> anyway<00:03:25.590> that's<00:03:26.580> a<00:03:26.700> pretty<00:03:26.910> good

00:03:27.080 --> 00:03:27.090 
semi liquid anyway that's a pretty good

00:03:27.090 --> 00:03:29.630 
semi liquid anyway that's a pretty good
indication<00:03:27.540> and<00:03:28.049> letting<00:03:28.380> it<00:03:28.470> set<00:03:28.829> so<00:03:29.280> it'll

00:03:29.630 --> 00:03:29.640 
indication and letting it set so it'll

00:03:29.640 --> 00:03:32.390 
indication and letting it set so it'll
really<00:03:29.849> expand<00:03:30.540> and<00:03:30.750> grow<00:03:30.900> that<00:03:31.860> disease

00:03:32.390 --> 00:03:32.400 
really expand and grow that disease

00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:35.780 
really expand and grow that disease
within<00:03:33.090> there<00:03:33.709> then<00:03:34.709> you<00:03:35.040> take<00:03:35.280> and<00:03:35.519> you<00:03:35.549> put

00:03:35.780 --> 00:03:35.790 
within there then you take and you put

00:03:35.790 --> 00:03:38.720 
within there then you take and you put
that<00:03:36.000> around<00:03:36.150> your<00:03:36.480> plants<00:03:37.079> along<00:03:37.829> your<00:03:38.130> Road

00:03:38.720 --> 00:03:38.730 
that around your plants along your Road

00:03:38.730 --> 00:03:41.110 
that around your plants along your Road
ditches<00:03:39.030> or<00:03:39.480> along<00:03:39.750> other<00:03:40.049> different<00:03:40.410> places

00:03:41.110 --> 00:03:41.120 
ditches or along other different places

00:03:41.120 --> 00:03:44.809 
ditches or along other different places
before<00:03:42.120> they<00:03:42.450> had<00:03:42.629> pesticides<00:03:43.519> that's<00:03:44.519> how

00:03:44.809 --> 00:03:44.819 
before they had pesticides that's how

00:03:44.819 --> 00:03:47.509 
before they had pesticides that's how
they<00:03:45.000> kill<00:03:45.329> grasshoppers<00:03:46.260> a<00:03:46.379> mad<00:03:46.620> grasshopper

00:03:47.509 --> 00:03:47.519 
they kill grasshoppers a mad grasshopper

00:03:47.519 --> 00:03:51.289 
they kill grasshoppers a mad grasshopper
disease<00:03:48.030> if<00:03:48.329> you<00:03:48.480> will<00:03:49.519> so<00:03:50.519> if<00:03:50.640> you<00:03:50.760> think<00:03:50.940> that

00:03:51.289 --> 00:03:51.299 
disease if you will so if you think that

00:03:51.299 --> 00:03:54.770 
disease if you will so if you think that
we<00:03:51.840> are<00:03:52.140> a<00:03:52.170> lot<00:03:52.560> further<00:03:52.920> ahead<00:03:53.190> then<00:03:54.180> uh<00:03:54.209> those

00:03:54.770 --> 00:03:54.780 
we are a lot further ahead then uh those

00:03:54.780 --> 00:03:56.900 
we are a lot further ahead then uh those
guys<00:03:55.049> a<00:03:55.079> hundred<00:03:55.620> and<00:03:55.769> twenty<00:03:56.099> years<00:03:56.129> ago<00:03:56.519> you

00:03:56.900 --> 00:03:56.910 
guys a hundred and twenty years ago you

00:03:56.910 --> 00:04:00.349 
guys a hundred and twenty years ago you
might<00:03:57.810> be<00:03:58.019> mistaken<00:03:58.700> because<00:03:59.700> in<00:04:00.030> a<00:04:00.060> lot<00:04:00.329> of

00:04:00.349 --> 00:04:00.359 
might be mistaken because in a lot of

00:04:00.359 --> 00:04:04.640 
might be mistaken because in a lot of
ways<00:04:00.630> they<00:04:01.590> were<00:04:02.069> ahead<00:04:02.310> of<00:04:02.730> us<00:04:02.880> I<00:04:03.440> hope<00:04:04.440> you
