00:00:00.070 --> 00:00:04.390
 good morning friends subscribers 

00:00:02.020 --> 00:00:07.300
 youtube this is a super review 

00:00:04.390 --> 00:00:11.559
 important because now I want to know 

00:00:07.300 --> 00:00:13.780
 which of the two devices is better 

00:00:11.559 --> 00:00:15.309
 recording of poinsettia recording of her 

00:00:13.780 --> 00:00:19.210
 I will also do it but this is from 

00:00:15.309 --> 00:00:21.340
 night with the front camera and I do not know 

00:00:19.210 --> 00:00:23.320
 you tell me I'm in a place in a 

00:00:21.340 --> 00:00:26.140
 lake in a park you see there is no 

00:00:23.320 --> 00:00:30.130
 light the only light is that from below where 

00:00:26.140 --> 00:00:32.289
 you walk is beautiful I hope to come tomorrow 

00:00:30.130 --> 00:00:36.010
 here and show them but look there 

00:00:32.289 --> 00:00:38.620
 which does a better job they say 

00:00:36.010 --> 00:00:41.469
 both cameras are the same but for 

00:00:38.620 --> 00:00:44.230
 I leave doubts and you leave 

00:00:41.469 --> 00:00:48.550
 We are trying the questions now 

00:00:44.230 --> 00:00:52.660
 do not be deceived ok the light is in the 

00:00:48.550 --> 00:00:55.510
 blog looks more clear look because if I 

00:00:52.660 --> 00:00:59.710
 I show on this side the light comes from this 

00:00:55.510 --> 00:01:02.260
 side you see good I do not know I do not know I think 

00:00:59.710 --> 00:01:05.170
 that as I want the plus I do not know maybe the 

00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:06.730
 device brightness but let me go 

00:01:05.170 --> 00:01:09.940
 to a darker place now 

00:01:06.730 --> 00:01:12.670
 look here I'm facing both 

00:01:09.940 --> 00:01:14.050
 front devices and the light is of 

00:01:12.670 --> 00:01:16.270
 front 

00:01:14.050 --> 00:01:18.550
 ok, you guys are the ones 

00:01:16.270 --> 00:01:19.930
 witnesses do not want to see a comment 

00:01:18.550 --> 00:01:22.150
 saying march, you do not have the same 

00:01:19.930 --> 00:01:24.820
 shirt that the other video all these 

00:01:22.150 --> 00:01:27.250
 videos I'm doing it the same day ok 

00:01:24.820 --> 00:01:29.380
 I'm doing many comparisons 

00:01:27.250 --> 00:01:31.660
 comparisons and I'm going to do them all 

00:01:29.380 --> 00:01:35.530
 those comparisons here below now yes 

00:01:31.660 --> 00:01:38.170
 come on with the next ok guys we keep 

00:01:35.530 --> 00:01:40.780
 in the same park here is too much 

00:01:38.170 --> 00:01:42.940
 dark for the devices because I 

00:01:40.780 --> 00:01:44.650
 I do not see anything on the screen well maybe 

00:01:42.940 --> 00:01:48.370
 the brightness because I have the brightness what 

00:01:44.650 --> 00:01:50.650
 minimum I use it like this at this time as the 

00:01:48.370 --> 00:01:52.900
 minimal brightness but good here we are 

00:01:50.650 --> 00:01:54.520
 getting a little more light the light is 

00:01:52.900 --> 00:01:56.830
 yellow the lights in the 

00:01:54.520 --> 00:02:00.610
 parks can be seen there and there 

00:01:56.830 --> 00:02:04.600
 you tell me what it looks like which one you see 

00:02:00.610 --> 00:02:06.670
 better 60 frames per second we're 

00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:08.710
 watching here so the movements are 

00:02:06.670 --> 00:02:12.510
 they will feel cuter 

00:02:08.710 --> 00:02:15.100
 audio audio guys which audio is better 

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:17.380
 movements cameras I know that the videos 

00:02:15.100 --> 00:02:20.500
 you do not see much quality but that's 

00:02:17.380 --> 00:02:23.290
 the idea ok I could be editing these 

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:26.040
 uy videos 

00:02:23.290 --> 00:02:26.040
 It seems 

00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:31.050
 it seems that sound appears I do not know what 

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:34.160
 it seems for nothing 

00:02:31.050 --> 00:02:34.160
 ok keep watching here 

00:02:35.510 --> 00:02:38.890
 let's wait for it to be clarified 

00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:52.190
 optical stabilization and stabilization 

00:02:48.170 --> 00:02:54.140
 with digital which wins which one has better 

00:02:52.190 --> 00:02:55.730
 audio is every detail that we're going to 

00:02:54.140 --> 00:02:57.920
 compare here so you can take 

00:02:55.730 --> 00:03:00.319
 a good decision I know that it is very 

00:02:57.920 --> 00:03:03.590
 dark here so I'm going to go somewhere 

00:03:00.319 --> 00:03:06.850
 there is a mouse go boy you know 

00:03:03.590 --> 00:03:11.100
 what happened to me that I was stopped 

00:03:06.850 --> 00:03:11.100
 and when we give a second 

00:03:13.010 --> 00:03:18.140
 and lowering the brightness to iphone 6 for 

00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:20.329
 that is not going to illuminate both the face 

00:03:18.140 --> 00:03:23.470
 but you know what happened to me 

00:03:20.329 --> 00:03:27.319
 forgot to take me , I forgot to record 

00:03:23.470 --> 00:03:29.629
 the day videos then I can no longer 

00:03:27.319 --> 00:03:32.209
 go back there again so 

00:03:29.629 --> 00:03:34.970
 you are going to see the truth here 

00:03:32.209 --> 00:03:37.310
 It does not matter so much, guys 

00:03:34.970 --> 00:03:39.859
 the difference is not so much since I made the 

00:03:37.310 --> 00:03:44.930
 iphone 6 video against iphone 5 

00:03:39.859 --> 00:03:46.970
 that and the difference was nothing or ok 

00:03:44.930 --> 00:03:49.629
 clearer that yes yes this video is by day 

00:03:46.970 --> 00:03:52.930
 the sun is still officially out 

00:03:49.629 --> 00:03:55.400
 it does not look so much but if it is cloudy 

00:03:52.930 --> 00:03:58.670
 so I say good you can not go 

00:03:55.400 --> 00:04:01.940
 down there again 30 minutes of 

00:03:58.670 --> 00:04:04.069
 30 minutes back so I said 

00:04:01.940 --> 00:04:07.250
 half do it here that has not yet 

00:04:04.069 --> 00:04:11.440
 fallen the night you see that day and there 

00:04:07.250 --> 00:04:13.840
 you can see the colors and all 

00:04:11.440 --> 00:04:17.760
 and the front I'm going to do walking 

00:04:13.840 --> 00:04:19.680
 around here also because it is that you imagine 

00:04:17.760 --> 00:04:22.170
 it is not there is not so much difference in 

00:04:19.680 --> 00:04:24.270
 truth in truth they really are the 

00:04:22.170 --> 00:04:27.720
 difference of these two devices is 

00:04:24.270 --> 00:04:30.180
 the screen comes back and I tell them and the 

00:04:27.720 --> 00:04:32.700
 battery that we are also going to make their 

00:04:30.180 --> 00:04:34.110
 respective comparisons 

00:04:32.700 --> 00:04:38.430
 we go with the front camera to 

00:04:34.110 --> 00:04:41.700
 finish already the camera comparisons 

00:04:38.430 --> 00:04:45.180
 ready guys 60 frames per second and 

00:04:41.700 --> 00:04:48.620
 are watching the movements let's go 

00:04:45.180 --> 00:04:49.940
 getting this clearer 

00:04:48.620 --> 00:04:53.090
 and 

00:04:49.940 --> 00:04:56.150
 if you ask me good no no better 

00:04:53.090 --> 00:05:00.680
 I leave it for the revised ok because it's 

00:04:56.150 --> 00:05:03.020
 that I notice is that as the plus is so 

00:05:00.680 --> 00:05:05.030
 big is hard to sustain and I 

00:05:03.020 --> 00:05:07.220
 I feel like I move it more with my hand 

00:05:05.030 --> 00:05:09.370
 but it is and it is not going in that because that is 

00:05:07.220 --> 00:05:13.300
 what the optical zoom is doing 

00:05:09.370 --> 00:05:13.300
 let's see the car 

00:05:13.380 --> 00:05:21.510
 focus pixel focus let's see the two 

00:05:16.810 --> 00:05:23.449
 they have the pixel fox let's see here 

00:05:21.510 --> 00:05:27.110
 focus 

00:05:23.449 --> 00:05:28.909
 focuses almost do not even realize when 

00:05:27.110 --> 00:05:33.460
 is doing here takes a little bit longer 

00:05:28.909 --> 00:05:36.250
 but when it goes here it's super fast 

00:05:33.460 --> 00:05:38.800
 and nothing guys I think I 'm going to take now 

00:05:36.250 --> 00:05:40.780
 several pictures like that in houses and I'm going to 

00:05:38.800 --> 00:05:43.800
 know simple because in truth the 

00:05:40.780 --> 00:05:47.340
 difference is minimal between these two 

00:05:43.800 --> 00:05:49.220
 devices already here is a little 

00:05:47.340 --> 00:05:51.890
 Dark 

00:05:49.220 --> 00:05:55.310
 I have also done so 

00:05:51.890 --> 00:05:58.250
 comparison of what's the name of the 

00:05:55.310 --> 00:06:01.150
 digital optical stabilization see it 

00:05:58.250 --> 00:06:01.150
 guys and see the difference 

00:06:03.740 --> 00:06:08.580
 with knows better 

00:06:06.240 --> 00:06:10.880
 you tell me if you see a difference 

00:06:08.580 --> 00:06:10.880
 girl 

00:06:14.960 --> 00:06:17.590
 to dance
