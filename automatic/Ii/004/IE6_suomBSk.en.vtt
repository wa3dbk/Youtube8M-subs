we're<00:00:00.390> gonna<00:00:00.539> map<00:00:00.810> the<00:00:00.989> human<00:00:01.140> brain<00:00:01.340> so<00:00:02.340> what

00:00:02.480 --> 00:00:02.490 
we're gonna map the human brain so what

00:00:02.490 --> 00:00:10.009 
we're gonna map the human brain so what
do<00:00:02.550> we<00:00:02.610> get<00:00:02.760> out<00:00:02.879> of<00:00:02.939> that<00:00:08.840> Anthony<00:00:09.840> here<00:00:09.990> for

00:00:10.009 --> 00:00:10.019 
do we get out of that Anthony here for

00:00:10.019 --> 00:00:12.169 
do we get out of that Anthony here for

foundations<00:00:21.240> are<00:00:21.810> gonna<00:00:21.900> work<00:00:22.109> together<00:00:22.350> to

00:00:22.970 --> 00:00:22.980 
foundations are gonna work together to

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:25.790 
foundations are gonna work together to
find<00:00:23.250> out<00:00:23.460> exactly<00:00:24.180> how<00:00:24.689> the<00:00:25.230> human<00:00:25.650> brain

00:00:25.790 --> 00:00:25.800 
find out exactly how the human brain

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:28.609 
find out exactly how the human brain
works<00:00:25.949> now<00:00:26.670> the<00:00:26.730> brain<00:00:27.029> is<00:00:27.390> a<00:00:27.840> complex<00:00:28.320> thing

00:00:28.609 --> 00:00:28.619 
works now the brain is a complex thing

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:30.500 
works now the brain is a complex thing
we<00:00:29.099> have<00:00:29.220> a<00:00:29.279> lot<00:00:29.400> of<00:00:29.429> general<00:00:29.970> knowledge<00:00:30.179> about

we have a lot of general knowledge about

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:32.540 
we have a lot of general knowledge about
it<00:00:30.660> we<00:00:30.750> can<00:00:30.869> point<00:00:31.109> to<00:00:31.230> it<00:00:31.349> and<00:00:31.380> go<00:00:31.529> oh<00:00:31.740> the

it we can point to it and go oh the

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:34.639 
it we can point to it and go oh the

about a hundred billion neurons firing
in<00:00:44.010> there<00:00:44.190> and<00:00:44.430> general<00:00:45.149> knowledge<00:00:45.329> is<00:00:45.690> not

00:00:45.889 --> 00:00:45.899 
in there and general knowledge is not

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:47.240 
in there and general knowledge is not
going<00:00:46.170> to<00:00:46.230> cut<00:00:46.410> it<00:00:46.530> if<00:00:46.649> we<00:00:46.800> want<00:00:46.950> to<00:00:47.010> make<00:00:47.129> the

00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:47.250 
going to cut it if we want to make the

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:49.400 
going to cut it if we want to make the

years mapping all the genes in human DNA

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:06.440 
years mapping all the genes in human DNA
expensive<00:01:04.290> yeah<00:01:04.619> time<00:01:05.430> consuming<00:01:05.939> sure<00:01:06.150> but

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:06.450 
expensive yeah time consuming sure but

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:08.000 
expensive yeah time consuming sure but
it's<00:01:06.600> estimated<00:01:06.810> that<00:01:07.350> it's<00:01:07.470> reached<00:01:07.740> about

800 billion dollars in benefits like
what<00:01:10.860> well<00:01:11.159> we<00:01:11.549> can<00:01:11.790> see<00:01:12.540> what<00:01:13.229> sort<00:01:13.530> of

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:13.650 
what well we can see what sort of

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:16.190 
what well we can see what sort of
diseases<00:01:14.010> are<00:01:14.400> genuinely<00:01:15.030> genetic<00:01:15.600> and<00:01:15.810> then

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:16.200 
diseases are genuinely genetic and then

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:18.140 
diseases are genuinely genetic and then
we<00:01:16.590> can<00:01:16.710> diagnose<00:01:17.280> them<00:01:17.490> easily<00:01:17.729> and<00:01:17.970> cheaply

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:18.150 
we can diagnose them easily and cheaply

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:20.660 
we can diagnose them easily and cheaply
and<00:01:18.750> work<00:01:18.900> even<00:01:19.200> faster<00:01:19.830> towards<00:01:20.430> eradicating

00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:20.670 
and work even faster towards eradicating

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:24.230 
and work even faster towards eradicating
them<00:01:21.119> entirely<00:01:21.479> you<00:01:22.049> can<00:01:22.200> pay<00:01:22.369> $79<00:01:23.369> spit<00:01:24.060> in<00:01:24.180> a

00:01:24.230 --> 00:01:24.240 
them entirely you can pay $79 spit in a

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:26.840 
them entirely you can pay $79 spit in a
tube<00:01:24.509> and<00:01:24.810> get<00:01:25.320> an<00:01:25.439> entire<00:01:25.890> genetic<00:01:26.460> history

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:26.850 
tube and get an entire genetic history

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:27.530 
tube and get an entire genetic history
of<00:01:27.000> yourself

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:27.540 
of yourself

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:29.870 
of yourself
that<00:01:27.659> is<00:01:27.840> amazing<00:01:28.439> and<00:01:28.619> the<00:01:28.979> idea<00:01:29.340> is<00:01:29.579> that<00:01:29.759> the

00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:29.880 
that is amazing and the idea is that the

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:31.819 
that is amazing and the idea is that the
brain<00:01:30.090> activity<00:01:30.479> map<00:01:30.689> is<00:01:31.259> going<00:01:31.530> to<00:01:31.590> have<00:01:31.710> the

00:01:31.819 --> 00:01:31.829 
brain activity map is going to have the

00:01:31.829 --> 00:01:35.300 
brain activity map is going to have the
same<00:01:32.250> huge<00:01:33.180> repercussions<00:01:33.869> the<00:01:34.799> human<00:01:35.040> genome

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:35.310 
same huge repercussions the human genome

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:38.270 
same huge repercussions the human genome
project<00:01:35.369> is<00:01:36.060> basically<00:01:36.630> we<00:01:37.439> can<00:01:37.680> see<00:01:37.979> if

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:38.280 
project is basically we can see if

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:40.130 
project is basically we can see if
you're<00:01:38.729> predisposed<00:01:39.420> to<00:01:39.630> having<00:01:39.810> something

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:40.140 
you're predisposed to having something

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:42.020 
you're predisposed to having something
like<00:01:40.290> Alzheimer's<00:01:40.979> or<00:01:41.009> Parkinson's<00:01:41.159> the

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:42.030 
like Alzheimer's or Parkinson's the

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:45.319 
like Alzheimer's or Parkinson's the
brain<00:01:42.240> activity<00:01:42.810> map<00:01:43.049> is<00:01:43.340> we<00:01:44.340> can<00:01:44.549> see<00:01:44.820> what

00:01:45.319 --> 00:01:45.329 
brain activity map is we can see what

00:01:45.329 --> 00:01:47.330 
brain activity map is we can see what
genuinely<00:01:45.810> happens<00:01:46.320> to<00:01:46.500> you<00:01:46.680> when<00:01:47.189> you're

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:47.340 
genuinely happens to you when you're

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:49.190 
genuinely happens to you when you're
being<00:01:47.579> affected<00:01:48.090> by<00:01:48.210> those<00:01:48.390> diseases<00:01:48.810> and

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:49.200 
being affected by those diseases and

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:51.679 
being affected by those diseases and
then<00:01:49.649> we<00:01:49.799> can<00:01:49.979> begin<00:01:50.130> correcting<00:01:51.030> it<00:01:51.149> we'll<00:01:51.570> be

00:01:51.679 --> 00:01:51.689 
then we can begin correcting it we'll be

00:01:51.689 --> 00:01:53.510 
then we can begin correcting it we'll be
able<00:01:51.780> to<00:01:51.930> understand<00:01:52.470> more<00:01:52.740> about<00:01:52.799> human

00:01:53.510 --> 00:01:53.520 
able to understand more about human

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:56.120 
able to understand more about human
perception<00:01:54.210> and<00:01:54.479> actions<00:01:55.110> we'll<00:01:55.619> even<00:01:55.770> unlock

00:01:56.120 --> 00:01:56.130 
perception and actions we'll even unlock

00:01:56.130 --> 00:01:58.880 
perception and actions we'll even unlock
how<00:01:56.850> human<00:01:57.299> consciousness<00:01:57.810> works<00:01:58.170> how<00:01:58.710> much

00:01:58.880 --> 00:01:58.890 
how human consciousness works how much
