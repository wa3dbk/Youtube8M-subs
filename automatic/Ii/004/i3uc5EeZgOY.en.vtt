00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:34.170 
two so just some quick facts they made

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:38.830 
two so just some quick facts they made
these<00:00:34.320> in<00:00:35.809> during<00:00:36.809> World<00:00:36.989> War<00:00:37.079> two<00:00:37.320> which<00:00:37.469> was

00:00:38.830 --> 00:00:38.840 
these in during World War two which was

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:43.130 
these in during World War two which was
1944<00:00:39.840> to<00:00:40.050> 1946<00:00:40.770> basically<00:00:41.610> the<00:00:41.730> main<00:00:41.940> war<00:00:42.660> part

00:00:43.130 --> 00:00:43.140

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:47.450 
1944 to 1946 basically the main war part
and<00:00:43.640> they<00:00:44.640> made<00:00:44.850> about<00:00:45.320> 18,000<00:00:46.320> of<00:00:46.440> these<00:00:46.590> so<00:00:47.430> I

00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:47.460 
and they made about 18,000 of these so I

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:49.549 
and they made about 18,000 of these so I
don't<00:00:47.730> usually<00:00:47.820> make<00:00:48.000> war<00:00:48.600> things<00:00:49.050> I'm<00:00:49.379> not

00:00:49.549 --> 00:00:49.559 
don't usually make war things I'm not

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:52.959 
don't usually make war things I'm not
I'm<00:00:50.370> very<00:00:50.760> fascinated<00:00:51.090> by<00:00:51.690> war<00:00:51.930> I<00:00:51.960> do<00:00:52.140> not

00:00:52.959 --> 00:00:52.969 
I'm very fascinated by war I do not

00:00:52.969 --> 00:00:55.340 
I'm very fascinated by war I do not
particularly<00:00:53.969> like<00:00:54.180> it<00:00:54.690> but<00:00:55.199> this<00:00:55.260> is

00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:55.350 
particularly like it but this is

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:57.740 
particularly like it but this is
fascinating<00:00:56.100> I<00:00:56.129> don't<00:00:56.340> like<00:00:56.969> to<00:00:57.149> build<00:00:57.300> walls

00:00:57.740 --> 00:00:57.750 
fascinating I don't like to build walls

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:02.000 
fascinating I don't like to build walls
warp<00:00:58.590> tube<00:00:59.129> or<00:00:59.520> any<00:00:59.699> war<00:01:00.300> mocks<00:01:01.020> but<00:01:01.559> I<00:01:01.590> did<00:01:01.859> do

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:02.010 
warp tube or any war mocks but I did do

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:03.380 
warp tube or any war mocks but I did do
this<00:01:02.129> one<00:01:02.340> and<00:01:02.460> there's<00:01:02.579> a<00:01:02.670> very<00:01:03.000> special

00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:03.390 
this one and there's a very special

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:05.479 
this one and there's a very special
reason<00:01:03.539> for<00:01:03.690> why<00:01:03.930> I<00:01:03.960> did<00:01:04.290> that<00:01:04.320> so<00:01:05.159> very

00:01:05.479 --> 00:01:05.489 
reason for why I did that so very

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:07.580 
reason for why I did that so very
recently<00:01:05.729> I<00:01:06.060> got<00:01:06.390> the<00:01:06.540> opportunity<00:01:07.200> of<00:01:07.229> a

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:07.590 
recently I got the opportunity of a

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:10.789 
recently I got the opportunity of a
lifetime<00:01:07.619> I<00:01:08.450> got<00:01:09.450> the<00:01:09.600> chance<00:01:09.840> to<00:01:10.020> actually

00:01:10.789 --> 00:01:10.799 
lifetime I got the chance to actually

00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:14.390 
lifetime I got the chance to actually
interview<00:01:11.400> two<00:01:12.119> World<00:01:12.750> War<00:01:12.990> two<00:01:13.229> veterans<00:01:13.860> so

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:14.400 
interview two World War two veterans so

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:15.800 
interview two World War two veterans so
I<00:01:14.430> know<00:01:14.610> that<00:01:14.909> doesn't<00:01:15.240> seem<00:01:15.360> like<00:01:15.540> much<00:01:15.570> to

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:15.810 
I know that doesn't seem like much to

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:18.800 
I know that doesn't seem like much to
you<00:01:16.170> and<00:01:16.470> a<00:01:16.710> lot<00:01:16.830> of<00:01:17.009> you<00:01:17.100> probably<00:01:17.810> just

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:18.810 
you and a lot of you probably just

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:21.230 
you and a lot of you probably just
thinking<00:01:19.229> big<00:01:20.070> deal<00:01:20.280> you<00:01:20.490> got<00:01:20.640> to<00:01:20.790> interview

00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:21.240 
thinking big deal you got to interview

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:24.020 
thinking big deal you got to interview
two<00:01:21.420> old<00:01:21.600> people<00:01:21.810> and<00:01:22.409> no<00:01:23.070> it<00:01:23.340> is<00:01:23.430> not<00:01:23.490> that<00:01:23.820> at

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:24.030 
two old people and no it is not that at

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:26.060 
two old people and no it is not that at
all<00:01:24.060> but<00:01:24.990> one<00:01:25.170> of<00:01:25.290> the<00:01:25.350> reasons<00:01:25.650> why<00:01:25.770> it<00:01:25.830> is<00:01:26.009> so

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:26.070 
all but one of the reasons why it is so

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:26.749 
all but one of the reasons why it is so
special

00:01:26.749 --> 00:01:26.759 
special

00:01:26.759 --> 00:01:29.600 
special
like<00:01:27.270> I<00:01:27.390> said<00:01:27.450> World<00:01:28.110> War<00:01:28.290> 2<00:01:28.470> was<00:01:28.710> in<00:01:28.950> the<00:01:29.220> 40s

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:29.610 
like I said World War 2 was in the 40s

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:34.490 
like I said World War 2 was in the 40s
early<00:01:29.939> 40s<00:01:30.930> and<00:01:31.229> in<00:01:32.130> the<00:01:32.280> mid<00:01:32.490> 40s<00:01:32.880> and<00:01:33.500> people

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:34.500 
early 40s and in the mid 40s and people

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:36.770 
early 40s and in the mid 40s and people
fighting<00:01:34.740> these<00:01:35.070> wars<00:01:35.130> probably<00:01:36.090> on<00:01:36.240> average

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:36.780 
fighting these wars probably on average

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:41.480 
fighting these wars probably on average
18<00:01:37.439> and<00:01:38.659> so<00:01:39.659> if<00:01:39.840> you<00:01:39.990> do<00:01:40.470> the<00:01:40.650> math<00:01:40.860> they're

00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:41.490 
18 and so if you do the math they're

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:44.240 
18 and so if you do the math they're
probably<00:01:41.759> at<00:01:42.329> their<00:01:42.780> youngest<00:01:43.320> people<00:01:44.130> who

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:44.250 
probably at their youngest people who

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:45.620 
probably at their youngest people who
were<00:01:44.369> actually<00:01:44.549> fighting<00:01:44.939> in<00:01:45.210> these<00:01:45.360> wars

00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:45.630 
were actually fighting in these wars

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:48.170 
were actually fighting in these wars
their<00:01:46.020> 70s<00:01:46.619> and<00:01:46.920> most<00:01:47.399> of<00:01:47.579> them<00:01:47.700> are<00:01:47.909> probably

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:48.180 
their 70s and most of them are probably

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:51.740 
their 70s and most of them are probably
in<00:01:48.270> their<00:01:48.390> 80s<00:01:48.869> about<00:01:49.590> now<00:01:49.770> and<00:01:50.070> even<00:01:50.579> older<00:01:51.210> so

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:51.750 
in their 80s about now and even older so

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:53.270 
in their 80s about now and even older so
they're<00:01:51.990> not<00:01:52.079> gonna<00:01:52.200> be<00:01:52.409> around<00:01:52.649> for<00:01:53.070> very

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:53.280 
they're not gonna be around for very

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:54.980 
they're not gonna be around for very
much<00:01:53.490> longer<00:01:53.549> there<00:01:54.240> was<00:01:54.329> just<00:01:54.540> such<00:01:54.750> an

00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:54.990 
much longer there was just such an

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:56.959 
much longer there was just such an
amazing<00:01:55.259> opportunity<00:01:55.770> to<00:01:56.130> actually<00:01:56.640> be<00:01:56.790> able

00:01:56.959 --> 00:01:56.969 
amazing opportunity to actually be able

00:01:56.969 --> 00:01:59.209 
amazing opportunity to actually be able
to<00:01:57.270> sit<00:01:57.479> down<00:01:57.509> and<00:01:57.780> have<00:01:57.960> an<00:01:58.200> interview<00:01:58.890> with

00:02:51.220 --> 00:02:53.100 
these so instead of talking I will show
you<00:02:51.280> the<00:02:51.520> MOC<00:02:51.700> now<00:02:51.910> it's<00:02:52.180> very<00:02:52.450> simple<00:02:52.930> it<00:02:53.080> is

00:02:53.100 --> 00:02:53.110 
you the MOC now it's very simple it is

00:02:53.110 --> 00:02:55.290 
you the MOC now it's very simple it is
not<00:02:53.440> too<00:02:53.980> many<00:02:54.100> things<00:02:54.370> you<00:02:54.550> need<00:02:54.880> to<00:02:55.030> replace

00:02:55.290 --> 00:02:55.300 
not too many things you need to replace

00:02:55.300 --> 00:02:58.140 
not too many things you need to replace
this<00:02:55.570> one<00:02:55.720> with<00:02:55.780> a<00:02:56.170> tighter<00:02:56.440> one<00:02:56.790> you<00:02:57.790> can<00:02:57.970> see

00:02:58.140 --> 00:02:58.150 
this one with a tighter one you can see

00:02:58.150 --> 00:03:00.570 
this one with a tighter one you can see
probably<00:02:58.480> need<00:02:58.600> a<00:02:58.840> blue<00:02:59.680> one<00:02:59.860> er<00:02:59.890> just<00:03:00.370> a

00:03:00.570 --> 00:03:00.580 
probably need a blue one er just a

00:03:00.580 --> 00:03:02.550 
probably need a blue one er just a
tighter<00:03:01.480> one<00:03:01.690> is<00:03:01.780> probably<00:03:01.900> an<00:03:02.080> older<00:03:02.350> piece

00:03:02.550 --> 00:03:02.560 
tighter one is probably an older piece

00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:05.910 
tighter one is probably an older piece
anyways<00:03:03.340> I<00:03:03.840> will<00:03:04.840> get<00:03:05.110> to<00:03:05.230> that<00:03:05.260> so<00:03:05.530> sorry<00:03:05.830> it's

anyways I will get to that so sorry it's

00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:10.260 
anyways I will get to that so sorry it's
a<00:03:06.010> bit<00:03:06.160> loose<00:03:07.170> these<00:03:08.170> here's<00:03:08.440> a<00:03:08.680> mini<00:03:09.220> thing<00:03:09.520> no

00:03:10.270 --> 00:03:14.450 
a bit loose these here's a mini thing no
pretty<00:03:10.720> standard<00:03:11.560> in<00:03:12.330> comparison<00:03:13.330> to<00:03:13.630> this

00:03:14.450 --> 00:03:14.460 
pretty standard in comparison to this

00:03:14.460 --> 00:03:24.050 
pretty standard in comparison to this
mop<00:03:16.410> can't<00:03:17.410> focus<00:03:18.070> that<00:03:18.550> would<00:03:18.700> be<00:03:18.880> fantastic

00:03:24.050 --> 00:03:24.060 

00:03:24.060 --> 00:03:26.580 

maybe<00:03:25.060> not<00:03:25.390> any<00:03:26.050> day<00:03:26.230> now

00:03:26.580 --> 00:03:26.590 
maybe not any day now

00:03:26.590 --> 00:03:28.860 
maybe not any day now
yeah<00:03:26.770> so<00:03:27.459> as<00:03:27.790> you<00:03:27.880> can<00:03:28.000> see<00:03:28.060> the<00:03:28.270> minifig<00:03:28.630> is

00:03:28.860 --> 00:03:28.870 
yeah so as you can see the minifig is

00:03:28.870 --> 00:03:30.750 
yeah so as you can see the minifig is
bigger<00:03:29.260> than<00:03:29.620> the<00:03:29.770> ship<00:03:29.980> it's<00:03:30.160> not<00:03:30.340> quite

00:03:30.750 --> 00:03:30.760 
bigger than the ship it's not quite

00:03:30.760 --> 00:03:33.240 
bigger than the ship it's not quite
we<00:03:31.270> need<00:03:31.450> this<00:03:31.600> bomber<00:03:31.959> it's<00:03:32.410> not<00:03:32.620> quite<00:03:32.890> mini

00:03:33.240 --> 00:03:33.250 
we need this bomber it's not quite mini

00:03:33.250 --> 00:03:36.120 
we need this bomber it's not quite mini
but<00:03:33.670> it's<00:03:33.970> not<00:03:34.420> too<00:03:34.990> minifig<00:03:35.470> scale<00:03:35.800> and<00:03:36.010> it's

00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:36.130 
but it's not too minifig scale and it's

00:03:36.130 --> 00:03:39.210 
but it's not too minifig scale and it's
not<00:03:36.340> large<00:03:36.900> it's<00:03:37.900> just<00:03:38.230> you<00:03:38.440> know<00:03:38.560> kind<00:03:39.100> of

00:03:39.210 --> 00:03:39.220 
not large it's just you know kind of

00:03:39.220 --> 00:03:41.820 
not large it's just you know kind of
small<00:03:39.430> so<00:03:40.360> I'm<00:03:40.750> just<00:03:40.900> going<00:03:41.110> to<00:03:41.170> take<00:03:41.440> this<00:03:41.620> off

00:03:41.820 --> 00:03:41.830 
small so I'm just going to take this off

00:03:41.830 --> 00:03:44.910 
small so I'm just going to take this off
for<00:03:42.040> the<00:03:42.130> time<00:03:42.370> being<00:03:43.320> so<00:03:44.320> here<00:03:44.470> it<00:03:44.530> is<00:03:44.650> you<00:03:44.770> can

00:03:44.910 --> 00:03:44.920 
for the time being so here it is you can

00:03:44.920 --> 00:03:47.040 
for the time being so here it is you can
look<00:03:45.040> up<00:03:45.160> pictures<00:03:45.550> of<00:03:45.580> these<00:03:45.970> bombers<00:03:46.780> and

00:03:47.040 --> 00:03:47.050 
look up pictures of these bombers and

00:03:47.050 --> 00:03:49.380 
look up pictures of these bombers and
you<00:03:47.560> can<00:03:47.709> see<00:03:47.890> how<00:03:48.250> realistic<00:03:48.580> it<00:03:49.030> is<00:03:49.150> I<00:03:49.330> don't

00:03:49.380 --> 00:03:49.390 
you can see how realistic it is I don't

00:03:49.390 --> 00:03:51.240 
you can see how realistic it is I don't
think<00:03:49.690> it's<00:03:49.810> that<00:03:49.900> realistic<00:03:50.680> because<00:03:51.160> I

00:03:51.240 --> 00:03:51.250 
think it's that realistic because I

00:03:51.250 --> 00:03:54.300 
think it's that realistic because I
totally<00:03:51.700> screwed<00:03:52.060> up<00:03:52.230> the<00:03:53.230> wing<00:03:53.530> area<00:03:54.100> with

00:03:54.300 --> 00:03:54.310 
totally screwed up the wing area with

00:03:54.310 --> 00:03:56.310 
totally screwed up the wing area with
the<00:03:54.550> propellers<00:03:55.060> yes<00:03:55.750> there<00:03:55.900> would<00:03:55.959> be<00:03:56.020> two

00:03:56.310 --> 00:03:56.320 
the propellers yes there would be two

00:03:56.320 --> 00:03:58.890 
the propellers yes there would be two
propellers<00:03:56.860> on<00:03:57.250> each<00:03:58.000> side<00:03:58.390> so<00:03:58.660> there'd<00:03:58.840> be

00:03:58.890 --> 00:03:58.900 
propellers on each side so there'd be

00:03:58.900 --> 00:04:00.330 
propellers on each side so there'd be
four<00:03:59.230> in<00:03:59.350> total<00:03:59.739> and<00:03:59.830> these<00:03:59.920> are<00:04:00.070> supposed<00:04:00.220> to

00:04:00.330 --> 00:04:00.340 
four in total and these are supposed to

00:04:00.340 --> 00:04:02.820 
four in total and these are supposed to
represent<00:04:00.520> propellers<00:04:01.470> so<00:04:02.470> here<00:04:02.650> in<00:04:02.739> the

00:04:02.820 --> 00:04:02.830 
represent propellers so here in the

00:04:02.830 --> 00:04:10.080 
represent propellers so here in the
front<00:04:03.090> would<00:04:04.090> be<00:04:04.680> guns<00:04:08.250> this<00:04:09.250> kind<00:04:09.580> of<00:04:09.730> shape

00:04:10.080 --> 00:04:10.090 
front would be guns this kind of shape

00:04:10.090 --> 00:04:12.090 
front would be guns this kind of shape
going<00:04:10.630> on<00:04:10.780> here<00:04:11.140> that's<00:04:11.380> what<00:04:11.530> the<00:04:11.560> cockpit

00:04:12.090 --> 00:04:12.100 
going on here that's what the cockpit

00:04:12.100 --> 00:04:17.840 
going on here that's what the cockpit
would<00:04:12.250> be<00:04:12.400> people<00:04:12.940> to<00:04:13.060> get<00:04:13.209> in<00:04:13.440> and<00:04:16.169> yeah<00:04:17.169> I

00:04:17.840 --> 00:04:17.850 
would be people to get in and yeah I

00:04:17.850 --> 00:04:20.190 
would be people to get in and yeah I
think<00:04:18.850> it<00:04:19.180> came<00:04:19.270> out<00:04:19.330> pretty<00:04:19.480> good<00:04:19.780> here<00:04:20.049> these

00:04:20.190 --> 00:04:20.200 
think it came out pretty good here these

00:04:20.200 --> 00:04:22.460 
think it came out pretty good here these
would<00:04:20.380> probably<00:04:20.410> be<00:04:20.919> more<00:04:21.220> like<00:04:21.489> ovals<00:04:22.060> on<00:04:22.300> a

00:04:22.460 --> 00:04:22.470 
would probably be more like ovals on a

00:04:22.470 --> 00:04:25.110 
would probably be more like ovals on a
b24<00:04:23.850> oops

00:04:25.110 --> 00:04:25.120 
b24 oops

00:04:25.120 --> 00:04:27.600 
b24 oops
yeah<00:04:25.990> you<00:04:26.260> probably<00:04:26.380> see<00:04:26.770> ovals<00:04:27.190> but<00:04:27.370> the

00:04:27.600 --> 00:04:27.610 
yeah you probably see ovals but the

00:04:27.610 --> 00:04:32.879 
yeah you probably see ovals but the
can't<00:04:28.030> really<00:04:28.360> get<00:04:29.050> oboes<00:04:29.500> in<00:04:30.159> Lego<00:04:30.639> uh<00:04:31.889> yeah

00:04:32.879 --> 00:04:32.889 
can't really get oboes in Lego uh yeah

00:04:32.889 --> 00:04:34.920 
can't really get oboes in Lego uh yeah
so<00:04:33.490> if<00:04:33.550> you<00:04:33.669> can<00:04:33.789> just<00:04:33.970> kind<00:04:34.060> of<00:04:34.240> see<00:04:34.750> the<00:04:34.900> shape

00:04:34.920 --> 00:04:34.930 
so if you can just kind of see the shape

00:04:34.930 --> 00:04:36.809 
so if you can just kind of see the shape
get<00:04:35.470> to<00:04:35.590> getting<00:04:35.770> the<00:04:35.830> skinnier<00:04:36.280> then<00:04:36.520> it<00:04:36.669> gets

00:04:36.809 --> 00:04:36.819 
get to getting the skinnier then it gets

00:04:36.819 --> 00:04:39.749 
get to getting the skinnier then it gets
a<00:04:36.879> little<00:04:37.120> fatter<00:04:37.389> then<00:04:37.870> it<00:04:38.020> dips<00:04:38.590> down<00:04:39.039> back

00:04:39.749 --> 00:04:39.759 
a little fatter then it dips down back

00:04:39.759 --> 00:04:41.939 
a little fatter then it dips down back
to<00:04:39.789> skinnier<00:04:40.330> towards<00:04:40.659> the<00:04:40.750> tail<00:04:41.020> so<00:04:41.860> it's

00:04:41.939 --> 00:04:41.949 
to skinnier towards the tail so it's

00:04:41.949 --> 00:04:44.640 
to skinnier towards the tail so it's
just<00:04:42.099> a<00:04:42.189> very<00:04:42.400> simple<00:04:42.729> MOC<00:04:43.419> it<00:04:43.719> is<00:04:43.930> basically

00:04:44.640 --> 00:04:44.650 
just a very simple MOC it is basically

just a very simple MOC it is basically
