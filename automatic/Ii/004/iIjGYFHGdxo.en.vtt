00:00:00.680 --> 00:00:07.770
 Hello dear nozhkemany last 

00:00:04.380 --> 00:00:11.010
 3 months I use mostly 

00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:14.570
 here are these two kershaw skyline knives and 

00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:17.940
 and not a rat I wear them constantly on the pocket 

00:00:14.570 --> 00:00:22.350
 constantly doing something small 

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:26.029
 city ​​work worries compare mean 

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:28.019
 compare the constant these two knives and right now 

00:00:26.029 --> 00:00:30.840
 shoot your attention on those moments 

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:33.660
 which, while he noted for himself at first 

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:36.930
 the moment is connected with the handle for a long time 

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:38.940
 I could not understand why the rat did not 

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:40.890
 lays down in your hand how do you take me not 

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:44.690
 comfortable that big that small 

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:49.079
 therefore could not understand until not 

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:51.870
 this one took a knife in the hands of all the matter in the 

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:53.610
 fingered recess if 

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:58.219
 deep enough subdub notch 

00:00:53.610 --> 00:01:01.109
 have this such a triangular protrusion and 

00:00:58.219 --> 00:01:05.210
 she rat this triangular protrusion no 

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:10.020
 and notch smoothly passes into the abdomen 

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:16.140
 so when you take the skyline finger 

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:18.900
 pointer does not rest here. 

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:20.700
 rests against the base of the palm and the knife 

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:25.430
 quite well felt in the hand 

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:25.430
 well controlled in rat 

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:30.960
 slides off like a prick well 

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:35.880
 will go about pull out already here 

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:39.509
 problematic in general such 

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:43.680
 small nuance such plus scan line 

00:01:39.509 --> 00:01:46.200
 of the second moment if you look at 

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:50.130
 liners it is clear that 

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:51.930
 the skyline is thicker than if you don’t pay 

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:55.409
 attention to how he comes to pita 

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:59.960
 the blade is clear what will happen 

00:01:55.409 --> 00:02:04.590
 this liner is more reliable moment 3 means 

00:01:59.960 --> 00:02:06.719
 if you compare the blades in length here 

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:09.209
 I combined at first the handle can be seen 

00:02:06.719 --> 00:02:13.940
 that do literally millimeter 3 can be 

00:02:09.209 --> 00:02:19.650
 The skyline is longer than the small rat 

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:23.099
 But if we compare it under the cliner and 

00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:27.209
 cutting edge then we see what's the difference 

00:02:23.099 --> 00:02:35.670
 here practically practically 

00:02:27.209 --> 00:02:37.890
 somewhere a centimeter goes that is skyline at 

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:40.590
 respect to cut more than it turns out 

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:55.319
 comfortable some great features 

00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:57.739
 But if you still have to compare the size of their 

00:02:55.319 --> 00:02:57.739
 Kershaw 

00:02:57.859 --> 00:03:05.430
 slightly longer than ontario ret 

00:03:01.069 --> 00:03:11.540
 put so here the handle here literally 

00:03:05.430 --> 00:03:17.430
 a few millimeters but nevertheless on 

00:03:11.540 --> 00:03:18.900
 I got a rat in my pocket why but this 

00:03:17.430 --> 00:03:22.230
 Here is the mysterious Russian soul 

00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:27.500
 I myself really can not explain why here 

00:03:22.230 --> 00:03:32.660
 this is a very good urban and stock shock 

00:03:27.500 --> 00:03:35.310
 for some small works the factory hassle 

00:03:32.660 --> 00:03:38.370
 hide the package cut something 

00:03:35.310 --> 00:03:40.400
 cut the thread there flat 

00:03:38.370 --> 00:03:46.519
 raping your pocket 

00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:48.879
 probably a rat may be a little bit thicker 

00:03:46.519 --> 00:03:52.010
 the handle that is a little bit more comfortable 

00:03:48.879 --> 00:03:54.200
 you can work with her more 

00:03:52.010 --> 00:03:56.510
 the traditional form of the blade yes here if 

00:03:54.200 --> 00:04:01.220
 here and so close show the blade but 

00:03:56.510 --> 00:04:04.909
 this is pure finnish knife if 

00:04:01.220 --> 00:04:06.769
 compare the tips of both knives here at 

00:04:04.909 --> 00:04:10.670
 rats have a definite plus 

00:04:06.769 --> 00:04:12.560
 that its tip can be seen thicker than 

00:04:10.670 --> 00:04:16.459
 skyline I allowed such 

00:04:12.560 --> 00:04:20.199
 Needle in a rat so you can even something 

00:04:16.459 --> 00:04:21.610
 pick it up and since i'm 

00:04:20.199 --> 00:04:24.560
 periodically 

00:04:21.610 --> 00:04:31.669
 out of town leaving countryside 

00:04:24.560 --> 00:04:33.650
 so probably in the aggregate here 

00:04:31.669 --> 00:04:35.449
 such additional conditions 

00:04:33.650 --> 00:04:40.910
 additional signs I'm still 

00:04:35.449 --> 00:04:44.120
 At the moment I choose a rat although it 

00:04:40.910 --> 00:04:47.410
 not final not final my 

00:04:44.120 --> 00:04:50.889
 choice because here this one 

00:04:47.410 --> 00:04:54.620
 linerock does not suit me and confuses 

00:04:50.889 --> 00:04:58.810
 if something more worthy comes across 

00:04:54.620 --> 00:05:02.599
 she will immediately move to my pocket 

00:04:58.810 --> 00:05:03.409
 Here is a comparison of two wonderful 

00:05:02.599 --> 00:05:07.840
 knives 

00:05:03.409 --> 00:05:07.840
 Thank you all for your attention all the while
