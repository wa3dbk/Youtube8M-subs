take a look at that all I'm doing is

00:00:58.390 --> 00:01:04.240 
take a look at that all I'm doing is
pedaling<00:00:59.390> off<00:00:59.510> the<00:00:59.690> a<00:00:59.720> string<00:01:02.920> and<00:01:03.920> I'm<00:01:04.100> only

00:01:04.240 --> 00:01:04.250 
pedaling off the a string and I'm only

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:05.980 
pedaling off the a string and I'm only
hitting<00:01:04.489> it<00:01:04.699> once<00:01:04.940> and<00:01:05.180> then<00:01:05.239> rolling<00:01:05.720> up<00:01:05.840> the

00:01:05.980 --> 00:01:05.990 
hitting it once and then rolling up the

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:08.500 
hitting it once and then rolling up the
other<00:01:06.110> two<00:01:06.320> notes<00:01:06.560> on<00:01:07.010> first<00:01:07.790> and<00:01:07.940> second<00:01:08.300> so

00:01:08.500 --> 00:01:08.510 
other two notes on first and second so

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:11.640 
other two notes on first and second so
it's<00:01:08.690> open<00:01:09.020> first<00:01:09.409> and<00:01:09.590> second<00:01:09.920> and<00:01:10.760> then

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:11.650 
it's open first and second and then

00:01:11.650 --> 00:01:14.770 
it's open first and second and then
using<00:01:12.650> my<00:01:12.740> pick<00:01:13.040> to<00:01:13.250> get<00:01:13.400> the<00:01:13.640> 2nd<00:01:14.390> fret<00:01:14.510> of<00:01:14.630> the

00:01:14.770 --> 00:01:14.780 
using my pick to get the 2nd fret of the

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:19.960 
using my pick to get the 2nd fret of the
D<00:01:14.870> string<00:01:17.710> and<00:01:18.710> the<00:01:18.890> best<00:01:19.100> way<00:01:19.250> to<00:01:19.310> do<00:01:19.550> that<00:01:19.580> if

don't do that run off the e string you
just<00:02:41.160> go<00:02:41.280> straight<00:02:41.849> to<00:02:42.030> an<00:02:42.120> a<00:02:42.239> chord

00:02:46.320 --> 00:02:46.330 

00:02:46.330 --> 00:02:49.410 

and<00:02:46.930> just<00:02:47.590> after<00:02:47.800> you<00:02:48.040> hit<00:02:48.190> it<00:02:48.370> slide<00:02:49.180> it<00:02:49.300> up

00:02:49.410 --> 00:02:49.420

00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:51.790 
and then start a another type of run

00:02:51.790 --> 00:02:54.020 
and then start a another type of run
we'll<00:02:52.030> go<00:02:52.180> over<00:02:52.210> that<00:02:52.360> in<00:02:52.480> a<00:02:52.600> sec<00:02:52.780> so<00:02:53.170> it's<00:02:53.320> like

00:02:54.020 --> 00:02:54.030 
we'll go over that in a sec so it's like

00:02:54.030 --> 00:03:00.000 
we'll go over that in a sec so it's like
that<00:02:55.030> just<00:02:56.610> now<00:02:57.930> the<00:02:58.930> intro<00:02:59.320> at<00:02:59.560> the<00:02:59.830> very

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:00.010 
that just now the intro at the very

00:03:00.010 --> 00:03:02.610 
that just now the intro at the very
beginning<00:03:00.130> there<00:03:01.090> is<00:03:01.330> no<00:03:01.570> pic<00:03:01.990> nose<00:03:02.260> between

00:03:02.610 --> 00:03:02.620 
beginning there is no pic nose between

00:03:02.620 --> 00:03:04.890 
beginning there is no pic nose between
each<00:03:03.220> one<00:03:03.460> of<00:03:03.490> these<00:03:03.670> runs<00:03:04.000> but<00:03:04.240> after<00:03:04.660> a<00:03:04.690> while

00:03:04.890 --> 00:03:04.900 
each one of these runs but after a while

00:03:04.900 --> 00:03:11.030 
each one of these runs but after a while
there<00:03:05.230> is<00:03:05.440> so<00:03:05.710> here's<00:03:05.980> the<00:03:06.130> beginning<00:03:06.280> again

one two three and one two three on the g

00:04:48.280 --> 00:05:07.860 
one two three and one two three on the g
string<00:04:48.310> open<00:04:55.169> so<00:04:56.169> slowly<00:05:02.099> so<00:05:03.099> its<00:05:03.280> second<00:05:06.870> play

00:05:07.860 --> 00:05:07.870

open<00:05:08.169> again

00:05:20.670 --> 00:05:20.680 

00:05:20.680 --> 00:05:24.770 

so<00:05:21.680> it's<00:05:21.860> actually

00:05:24.770 --> 00:05:24.780 

00:05:24.780 --> 00:05:34.430 

bolt<00:05:25.380> to<00:05:25.590> open<00:05:25.950> and<00:05:26.100> then<00:05:26.220> to<00:05:26.460> open

00:05:34.430 --> 00:05:34.440 

00:05:34.440 --> 00:05:39.360

00:05:39.360 --> 00:05:39.370 

00:05:39.370 --> 00:05:47.839 

ok

00:05:47.839 --> 00:05:47.849 

00:05:47.849 --> 00:05:58.580 

me

00:05:58.580 --> 00:05:58.590 

00:05:58.590 --> 00:06:08.339 

so<00:05:59.590> that's<00:06:02.100> same<00:06:03.100> as<00:06:03.220> before<00:06:03.639> here<00:06:07.349> that's

00:06:08.339 --> 00:06:08.349 
so that's same as before here that's

00:06:08.349 --> 00:06:15.650 
so that's same as before here that's
fifth<00:06:08.710> and<00:06:08.949> not<00:06:09.099> open<00:06:10.650> and<00:06:11.650> then<00:06:11.949> third<00:06:13.680> open

00:06:15.650 --> 00:06:15.660 
fifth and not open and then third open
