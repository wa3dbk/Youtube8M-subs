gonna<00:00:11.370> explain<00:00:11.580> to<00:00:11.639> you<00:00:11.820> why<00:00:12.179> I<00:00:12.210> think<00:00:12.750> that's

00:00:13.100 --> 00:00:13.110 
gonna explain to you why I think that's

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:14.360 
gonna explain to you why I think that's
just<00:00:13.200> my<00:00:13.380> opinion<00:00:13.410> so<00:00:14.040> you're<00:00:14.130> gonna<00:00:14.219> get

00:00:14.360 --> 00:00:14.370 
just my opinion so you're gonna get

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:16.340 
just my opinion so you're gonna get
power<00:00:14.580> just<00:00:14.910> don't<00:00:15.059> watch<00:00:15.210> it's<00:00:15.719> what<00:00:15.870> I<00:00:15.900> think

00:00:16.340 --> 00:00:16.350 
power just don't watch it's what I think

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:19.250 
power just don't watch it's what I think
that<00:00:16.650> triceps<00:00:17.609> should<00:00:18.119> be<00:00:18.210> trained<00:00:18.480> with<00:00:18.690> high

00:00:19.250 --> 00:00:19.260 
that triceps should be trained with high

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:22.820 
that triceps should be trained with high
value<00:00:19.680> um<00:00:20.660> simple<00:00:21.660> first<00:00:22.320> reason<00:00:22.560> I<00:00:22.619> think

00:00:22.820 --> 00:00:22.830 
value um simple first reason I think

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:25.700 
value um simple first reason I think
it's<00:00:22.949> weights<00:00:23.160> if<00:00:23.900> you<00:00:24.900> go<00:00:25.050> too<00:00:25.109> heavy<00:00:25.500> on

00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:25.710 
it's weights if you go too heavy on

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:28.550 
it's weights if you go too heavy on
tricep<00:00:26.699> exercises<00:00:27.210> number<00:00:27.689> one<00:00:28.050> you<00:00:28.349> more

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:28.560 
tricep exercises number one you more

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:29.870 
tricep exercises number one you more
likely<00:00:28.890> to<00:00:29.039> you<00:00:29.160> to<00:00:29.310> incorporate<00:00:29.760> other

00:00:29.870 --> 00:00:29.880 
likely to you to incorporate other

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:31.790 
likely to you to incorporate other
muscle<00:00:30.300> groups<00:00:30.330> to<00:00:30.810> help<00:00:30.840> you<00:00:31.080> out<00:00:31.109> even<00:00:31.710> if

00:00:31.790 --> 00:00:31.800 
muscle groups to help you out even if

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:32.870 
muscle groups to help you out even if
you're<00:00:31.859> gonna<00:00:32.009> push<00:00:32.309> down<00:00:32.520> and<00:00:32.640> you<00:00:32.730> go<00:00:32.820> too

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:32.880 
you're gonna push down and you go too

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:34.850 
you're gonna push down and you go too
heavy<00:00:33.149> you<00:00:33.899> don't<00:00:34.050> even<00:00:34.140> get<00:00:34.350> the<00:00:34.440> tendency<00:00:34.770> to

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:34.860 
heavy you don't even get the tendency to

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:36.770 
heavy you don't even get the tendency to
lean<00:00:35.010> in<00:00:35.250> and<00:00:35.460> it's<00:00:36.360> going<00:00:36.480> to<00:00:36.600> screw<00:00:36.750> with

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:36.780 
lean in and it's going to screw with

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:38.450 
lean in and it's going to screw with
your<00:00:36.960> mama's<00:00:37.230> connection<00:00:37.680> that's<00:00:37.770> 12<00:00:38.190> if<00:00:38.340> you

00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:38.460 
your mama's connection that's 12 if you

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:39.799 
your mama's connection that's 12 if you
go<00:00:38.550> too<00:00:38.700> heavy<00:00:38.820> it's<00:00:39.059> got<00:00:39.149> a<00:00:39.180> damaged<00:00:39.719> your

00:00:39.799 --> 00:00:39.809 
go too heavy it's got a damaged your

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:41.810 
go too heavy it's got a damaged your
elbows<00:00:40.200> right<00:00:40.500> so<00:00:41.040> we<00:00:41.129> already<00:00:41.370> know<00:00:41.520> weights

00:00:41.810 --> 00:00:41.820 
elbows right so we already know weights

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:43.520 
elbows right so we already know weights
is<00:00:42.030> a<00:00:42.059> problem<00:00:42.390> you<00:00:42.450> can't<00:00:42.629> go<00:00:42.719> too<00:00:42.989> heavy<00:00:43.170> when

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:43.530 
is a problem you can't go too heavy when

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:46.190 
is a problem you can't go too heavy when
doing<00:00:43.800> triceps<00:00:44.219> because<00:00:44.579> like<00:00:44.820> I<00:00:44.910> said<00:00:45.200> you

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:46.200 
doing triceps because like I said you

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:47.360 
doing triceps because like I said you
know<00:00:46.320> it's<00:00:46.559> gonna<00:00:46.739> incorporate<00:00:47.010> all<00:00:47.280> the

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:47.370 
know it's gonna incorporate all the

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:49.130 
know it's gonna incorporate all the
muscles<00:00:47.760> your<00:00:48.059> elbows<00:00:48.539> might<00:00:48.840> getting

00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:49.140 
muscles your elbows might getting

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:51.979 
muscles your elbows might getting
injured<00:00:49.890> and<00:00:50.100> stuff<00:00:50.250> like<00:00:50.340> that<00:00:50.399> and<00:00:50.930> so<00:00:51.930> you

00:00:51.979 --> 00:00:51.989 
injured and stuff like that and so you

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:54.170 
injured and stuff like that and so you
got<00:00:52.230> a<00:00:52.260> decrease<00:00:52.590> the<00:00:52.710> way<00:00:52.860> not<00:00:53.340> drastically

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:54.180 
got a decrease the way not drastically

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:55.670 
got a decrease the way not drastically
but<00:00:54.480> it's<00:00:54.600> like<00:00:54.809> seventy<00:00:55.140> percent<00:00:55.230> every<00:00:55.440> one

00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:55.680 
but it's like seventy percent every one

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:57.760 
but it's like seventy percent every one
of<00:00:55.739> my<00:00:55.770> max<00:00:56.039> and<00:00:56.579> when<00:00:56.730> you<00:00:56.789> decrease<00:00:57.149> the<00:00:57.270> way

00:00:57.760 --> 00:00:57.770 
of my max and when you decrease the way

00:00:57.770 --> 00:01:00.889 
of my max and when you decrease the way
you<00:00:58.770> have<00:00:59.070> to<00:00:59.280> to<00:00:59.550> to<00:00:59.910> to<00:00:59.940> compensate<00:01:00.719> for<00:01:00.870> that

00:01:00.889 --> 00:01:00.899 
you have to to to to compensate for that

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:02.510 
you have to to to to compensate for that
you<00:01:01.289> know<00:01:01.379> what<00:01:01.620> intensity<00:01:02.039> because<00:01:02.309> if<00:01:02.430> the

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:02.520 
you know what intensity because if the

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:04.460 
you know what intensity because if the
weight<00:01:02.699> is<00:01:02.730> load<00:01:03.059> in<00:01:03.180> intensity<00:01:03.570> goes<00:01:03.660> down<00:01:03.960> so

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:04.470 
weight is load in intensity goes down so

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:06.080 
weight is load in intensity goes down so
what<00:01:04.619> I<00:01:04.650> do<00:01:04.739> is<00:01:04.860> I<00:01:04.979> decrease<00:01:05.369> the<00:01:05.430> way<00:01:05.729> but<00:01:06.060> I

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:06.090 
what I do is I decrease the way but I

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:08.929 
what I do is I decrease the way but I
increase<00:01:06.450> the<00:01:06.600> wraps<00:01:06.930> and<00:01:07.110> assess<00:01:07.439> and<00:01:07.860> I<00:01:08.729> also

00:01:08.929 --> 00:01:08.939 
increase the wraps and assess and I also

00:01:08.939 --> 00:01:12.020 
increase the wraps and assess and I also
lower<00:01:09.780> the<00:01:09.930> rest<00:01:10.229> periods<00:01:10.650> this<00:01:11.340> way<00:01:11.580> you<00:01:12.000> know

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:12.030 
lower the rest periods this way you know

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:14.149 
lower the rest periods this way you know
even<00:01:12.990> though<00:01:13.290> the<00:01:13.409> weight<00:01:13.590> is<00:01:13.770> low<00:01:13.920> the

00:01:14.149 --> 00:01:14.159 
even though the weight is low the

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:15.679 
even though the weight is low the
intensity<00:01:14.580> goes<00:01:14.610> up<00:01:14.939> you<00:01:15.210> know<00:01:15.330> there's<00:01:15.540> many

00:01:15.679 --> 00:01:15.689 
intensity goes up you know there's many

00:01:15.689 --> 00:01:17.090 
intensity goes up you know there's many
ways<00:01:15.840> to<00:01:15.900> increase<00:01:16.110> intensity<00:01:16.590> not<00:01:16.860> just<00:01:17.009> by

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:17.100 
ways to increase intensity not just by

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:18.770 
ways to increase intensity not just by
lifting<00:01:17.250> heavy<00:01:17.610> you<00:01:18.000> could<00:01:18.150> do<00:01:18.240> drops<00:01:18.540> else

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:18.780 
lifting heavy you could do drops else

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:20.810 
lifting heavy you could do drops else
you<00:01:18.930> could<00:01:19.080> do<00:01:19.229> value<00:01:19.979> we<00:01:20.250> could<00:01:20.400> do<00:01:20.520> short

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:20.820 
you could do value we could do short

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:22.789 
you could do value we could do short
rest<00:01:21.030> periods<00:01:21.180> so<00:01:21.960> that's<00:01:22.170> why<00:01:22.320> I<00:01:22.350> do<00:01:22.439> so<00:01:22.710> many

00:01:22.789 --> 00:01:22.799 
rest periods so that's why I do so many

00:01:22.799 --> 00:01:25.010 
rest periods so that's why I do so many
exercises<00:01:23.070> on<00:01:24.000> my<00:01:24.060> tricep<00:01:24.659> day<00:01:24.810> especially

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:25.020 
exercises on my tricep day especially

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:27.020 
exercises on my tricep day especially
I'm<00:01:25.439> not<00:01:25.650> it<00:01:25.890> also<00:01:26.009> depends<00:01:26.250> on<00:01:26.310> your<00:01:26.430> goal<00:01:26.640> if

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:27.030 
I'm not it also depends on your goal if

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:28.700 
I'm not it also depends on your goal if
you<00:01:27.180> just<00:01:27.330> want<00:01:27.450> a<00:01:27.509> big<00:01:27.780> triceps<00:01:28.049> think<00:01:28.530> ahead

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:28.710 
you just want a big triceps think ahead

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:29.749 
you just want a big triceps think ahead
by<00:01:28.890> all<00:01:28.979> means<00:01:29.189> let's<00:01:29.400> have<00:01:29.549> it<00:01:29.670> you<00:01:29.729> don't

00:01:29.749 --> 00:01:29.759

00:01:33.859 --> 00:01:33.869 
tricep I want actually want separation

00:01:33.869 --> 00:01:35.990 
tricep I want actually want separation
honored<00:01:34.439> guest<00:01:34.650> machine<00:01:34.920> actually<00:01:35.640> want

separation in my tricep all three heads
of<00:01:37.920> my<00:01:38.009> tricep<00:01:38.460> so<00:01:39.000> that<00:01:39.119> when<00:01:39.240> I<00:01:39.270> go<00:01:39.450> on<00:01:39.540> to<00:01:39.630> cut

00:01:39.859 --> 00:01:39.869 
of my tricep so that when I go on to cut

00:01:39.869 --> 00:01:42.530 
of my tricep so that when I go on to cut
in<00:01:40.140> the<00:01:40.619> next<00:01:40.920> two<00:01:41.070> years<00:01:41.310> I<00:01:41.700> get<00:01:42.299> to<00:01:42.420> actually

in the next two years I get to actually

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:44.359 
in the next two years I get to actually
see<00:01:42.720> every<00:01:43.439> head<00:01:43.590> of<00:01:43.619> my<00:01:43.770> tricep<00:01:44.189> and<00:01:44.310> I'm

00:01:44.359 --> 00:01:44.369 
see every head of my tricep and I'm

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:45.980 
see every head of my tricep and I'm
saying<00:01:44.610> you<00:01:45.090> don't<00:01:45.240> get<00:01:45.420> that<00:01:45.600> by<00:01:45.720> just<00:01:45.780> doing

00:01:45.980 --> 00:01:45.990 
saying you don't get that by just doing

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:47.600 
saying you don't get that by just doing
heavy<00:01:46.290> ass<00:01:46.500> weights<00:01:46.530> on<00:01:46.890> cue<00:01:47.040> but<00:01:47.159> nobody<00:01:47.430> told

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:47.610 
heavy ass weights on cue but nobody told

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:50.300 
heavy ass weights on cue but nobody told
you<00:01:47.790> right<00:01:47.970> the<00:01:48.810> heavy<00:01:49.049> ass<00:01:49.259> weights<00:01:49.310> you're

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:50.310 
you right the heavy ass weights you're

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:51.830 
you right the heavy ass weights you're
gonna<00:01:50.430> jerk<00:01:50.759> the<00:01:50.970> way<00:01:51.149> you<00:01:51.420> use<00:01:51.630> momentum

00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:51.840 
gonna jerk the way you use momentum

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:53.749 
gonna jerk the way you use momentum
you're<00:01:52.799> going<00:01:52.920> to<00:01:52.979> use<00:01:53.130> other<00:01:53.310> muscle<00:01:53.729> groups

00:01:53.749 --> 00:01:53.759 
you're going to use other muscle groups

00:01:53.759 --> 00:01:55.639 
you're going to use other muscle groups
you're<00:01:54.240> not<00:01:54.390> going<00:01:54.570> to<00:01:54.630> focus<00:01:54.869> on<00:01:55.140> getting<00:01:55.470> a

00:01:55.639 --> 00:01:55.649 
you're not going to focus on getting a

00:01:55.649 --> 00:01:57.350 
you're not going to focus on getting a
good<00:01:55.829> contrasting<00:01:56.369> squeeze<00:01:56.579> and<00:01:56.850> you're<00:01:57.210> not

00:01:57.350 --> 00:01:57.360 
good contrasting squeeze and you're not

00:01:57.360 --> 00:01:58.999 
good contrasting squeeze and you're not
gonna<00:01:57.509> get<00:01:57.750> that<00:01:57.810> separation<00:01:58.469> between<00:01:58.829> the

00:01:58.999 --> 00:01:59.009 
gonna get that separation between the

00:01:59.009 --> 00:02:03.499 
gonna get that separation between the
muscle<00:01:59.399> and<00:01:59.549> that's<00:02:00.509> one<00:02:00.719> so<00:02:02.210> the<00:02:03.210> reason<00:02:03.329> why

00:02:03.499 --> 00:02:03.509 
muscle and that's one so the reason why

00:02:03.509 --> 00:02:05.359 
muscle and that's one so the reason why
I<00:02:03.780> believe<00:02:04.140> everybody<00:02:04.409> should<00:02:04.560> do<00:02:04.770> volume<00:02:05.009> on

00:02:05.359 --> 00:02:05.369 
I believe everybody should do volume on

00:02:05.369 --> 00:02:07.310 
I believe everybody should do volume on
triceps<00:02:05.820> or<00:02:06.030> if<00:02:06.299> you're<00:02:06.450> trying<00:02:06.570> to<00:02:06.689> get<00:02:06.780> that

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:07.320 
triceps or if you're trying to get that

00:02:21.559 --> 00:02:21.569 
you want to develop each head

00:02:21.569 --> 00:02:23.540 
you want to develop each head
individually<00:02:22.350> meaning<00:02:23.190> you're<00:02:23.310> trying<00:02:23.459> to

00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:25.110 
get that separation I'll recommend doing

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:27.199 
get that separation I'll recommend doing
a<00:02:25.260> lot<00:02:25.380> of<00:02:25.440> different<00:02:25.530> exercises<00:02:26.190> you<00:02:26.970> can't

00:02:27.199 --> 00:02:27.209 
a lot of different exercises you can't

00:02:27.209 --> 00:02:28.910 
a lot of different exercises you can't
just<00:02:27.270> do<00:02:27.480> dips<00:02:27.750> and<00:02:27.990> close<00:02:28.350> grip<00:02:28.530> bench<00:02:28.560> press

00:02:28.910 --> 00:02:28.920 
just do dips and close grip bench press

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:30.199 
just do dips and close grip bench press
yes<00:02:29.130> they're<00:02:29.370> great<00:02:29.640> but<00:02:29.819> they're<00:02:29.880> only<00:02:30.030> going

00:02:30.199 --> 00:02:30.209 
yes they're great but they're only going

00:02:30.209 --> 00:02:32.449 
yes they're great but they're only going
to<00:02:30.300> target<00:02:30.510> you<00:02:31.200> know<00:02:31.319> like<00:02:31.709> at<00:02:31.920> most<00:02:32.250> two

00:02:32.449 --> 00:02:32.459 
to target you know like at most two

00:02:32.459 --> 00:02:34.010 
to target you know like at most two
heads<00:02:32.610> of<00:02:32.700> the<00:02:32.760> tricep<00:02:33.180> the<00:02:33.330> third<00:02:33.569> one<00:02:33.780> they

00:02:34.010 --> 00:02:34.020 
heads of the tricep the third one they

00:02:34.020 --> 00:02:35.330 
heads of the tricep the third one they
might<00:02:34.200> hit<00:02:34.350> it<00:02:34.380> a<00:02:34.500> little<00:02:34.650> bit<00:02:34.920> but<00:02:35.100> not<00:02:35.160> enough

00:02:35.330 --> 00:02:35.340 
might hit it a little bit but not enough

00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:37.820 
might hit it a little bit but not enough
to<00:02:35.880> get<00:02:36.300> that<00:02:36.420> separation<00:02:36.840> so<00:02:37.500> that's<00:02:37.680> why<00:02:37.800> I

00:02:37.820 --> 00:02:37.830 
to get that separation so that's why I

00:02:37.830 --> 00:02:39.170 
to get that separation so that's why I
incorporate<00:02:38.250> almost<00:02:38.520> every<00:02:38.700> tries<00:02:38.880> to<00:02:39.030> move

00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:39.180 
incorporate almost every tries to move

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:40.610 
incorporate almost every tries to move
man<00:02:39.390> you<00:02:39.510> might<00:02:39.660> be<00:02:39.810> my<00:02:39.930> tricycle<00:02:40.200> chain

00:02:40.610 --> 00:02:40.620 
man you might be my tricycle chain

00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:42.410 
man you might be my tricycle chain
because<00:02:41.280> you<00:02:41.610> know<00:02:41.700> like<00:02:41.910> the<00:02:41.970> tricep<00:02:42.300> is

00:02:42.410 --> 00:02:42.420 
because you know like the tricep is

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:44.020 
because you know like the tricep is
really<00:02:42.810> three<00:02:43.050> monsters<00:02:43.410> don't<00:02:43.530> forget<00:02:43.800> that

00:02:44.020 --> 00:02:44.030 
really three monsters don't forget that

really three monsters don't forget that
another<00:02:45.030> reason<00:02:45.180> is<00:02:45.360> Mama's<00:02:45.690> connection<00:02:46.170> the

00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:46.680 
another reason is Mama's connection the

00:02:51.320 --> 00:02:51.330 
you are to get Mama's connection

00:02:51.330 --> 00:02:52.520 
you are to get Mama's connection

00:02:57.920 --> 00:02:57.930 
for a long time you know I'm saying you

00:02:57.930 --> 00:02:59.630 
for a long time you know I'm saying you
want<00:02:58.080> to<00:02:58.140> get<00:02:58.290> that<00:02:58.440> contraction<00:02:59.430> and<00:02:59.550> that

00:02:59.630 --> 00:02:59.640 
want to get that contraction and that

00:02:59.640 --> 00:03:01.340 
want to get that contraction and that
squeeze<00:02:59.940> you<00:03:00.060> want<00:03:00.180> to<00:03:00.269> get<00:03:00.420> the<00:03:00.540> blood<00:03:00.810> used

00:03:01.340 --> 00:03:01.350 
squeeze you want to get the blood used

00:03:01.350 --> 00:03:02.809 
squeeze you want to get the blood used
to<00:03:01.470> going<00:03:01.620> in<00:03:01.769> that<00:03:01.860> muscle<00:03:02.280> you<00:03:02.370> want<00:03:02.519> to<00:03:02.610> plot

00:03:02.809 --> 00:03:02.819 
to going in that muscle you want to plot

00:03:02.819 --> 00:03:05.360 
to going in that muscle you want to plot
slowly<00:03:03.090> just<00:03:03.900> you<00:03:04.019> want<00:03:04.170> to<00:03:04.230> go<00:03:04.440> all<00:03:04.830> three

00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:05.370 
slowly just you want to go all three

00:03:05.370 --> 00:03:07.190 
slowly just you want to go all three
heads<00:03:05.519> of<00:03:05.640> your<00:03:06.000> triceps<00:03:06.480> with<00:03:06.690> blood<00:03:06.900> and<00:03:07.050> you

00:03:07.190 --> 00:03:07.200 
heads of your triceps with blood and you

00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:09.009 
heads of your triceps with blood and you
can't<00:03:07.440> do<00:03:07.560> that<00:03:07.680> with<00:03:07.800> just<00:03:07.920> three<00:03:08.430> exercises

00:03:09.009 --> 00:03:09.019 
can't do that with just three exercises

00:03:09.019 --> 00:03:11.630 
can't do that with just three exercises
three<00:03:10.019> to<00:03:10.140> ten<00:03:10.319> reps<00:03:10.350> sound<00:03:11.250> happen<00:03:11.550> you're

00:03:11.630 --> 00:03:11.640 
three to ten reps sound happen you're

00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:12.710 
three to ten reps sound happen you're
gonna<00:03:11.700> get<00:03:11.880> big<00:03:12.120> like<00:03:12.150> I<00:03:12.360> said<00:03:12.540> you're<00:03:12.630> gonna

00:03:12.710 --> 00:03:12.720 
gonna get big like I said you're gonna

00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:14.420 
gonna get big like I said you're gonna
have<00:03:12.900> a<00:03:12.930> big<00:03:13.140> tricep<00:03:13.560> but<00:03:14.069> you<00:03:14.190> won't<00:03:14.250> have

00:03:14.420 --> 00:03:14.430 
have a big tricep but you won't have

00:03:14.430 --> 00:03:18.440 
have a big tricep but you won't have
that<00:03:14.459> that<00:03:15.090> separation<00:03:15.630> in<00:03:16.019> the<00:03:16.110> muscle<00:03:17.450> and

00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:18.450 
that that separation in the muscle and

00:03:18.450 --> 00:03:21.069 
that that separation in the muscle and
the<00:03:18.989> fourth<00:03:19.260> reason<00:03:19.440> I<00:03:19.590> just<00:03:19.650> AIT's<00:03:19.950> frequency

00:03:21.069 --> 00:03:21.079 
the fourth reason I just AIT's frequency

00:03:21.079 --> 00:03:24.830 
the fourth reason I just AIT's frequency
when<00:03:22.079> doing<00:03:22.320> high<00:03:22.500> volume<00:03:23.420> you<00:03:24.420> can't<00:03:24.690> go<00:03:24.780> too

00:03:24.830 --> 00:03:24.840 
when doing high volume you can't go too

00:03:24.840 --> 00:03:26.240 
when doing high volume you can't go too
heavy<00:03:25.200> right<00:03:25.230> so<00:03:25.560> that<00:03:25.680> means<00:03:25.890> you're<00:03:26.160> not

00:03:26.240 --> 00:03:26.250 
heavy right so that means you're not

00:03:26.250 --> 00:03:27.680 
heavy right so that means you're not
going<00:03:26.430> to<00:03:26.489> really<00:03:26.670> put<00:03:26.910> too<00:03:27.030> many<00:03:27.150> tears<00:03:27.510> in

00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:27.690 
going to really put too many tears in

00:03:27.690 --> 00:03:29.090 
going to really put too many tears in
your<00:03:27.720> triceps<00:03:27.989> you<00:03:28.320> know<00:03:28.440> and<00:03:28.560> I<00:03:28.590> have<00:03:28.739> doms

00:03:29.090 --> 00:03:29.100 
your triceps you know and I have doms

00:03:29.100 --> 00:03:31.550 
your triceps you know and I have doms
you<00:03:29.910> know<00:03:30.030> delayed<00:03:30.750> onset<00:03:30.959> muscle<00:03:31.230> soreness

00:03:31.550 --> 00:03:31.560 
you know delayed onset muscle soreness

00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:33.350 
you know delayed onset muscle soreness
for<00:03:32.130> like<00:03:32.220> four<00:03:32.489> or<00:03:32.549> five<00:03:32.579> days<00:03:32.730> so<00:03:33.150> it's<00:03:33.269> going

00:03:33.350 --> 00:03:33.360 
for like four or five days so it's going

00:03:33.360 --> 00:03:34.310 
for like four or five days so it's going
to<00:03:33.450> give<00:03:33.540> you<00:03:33.630> a<00:03:33.660> chance<00:03:33.720> to<00:03:34.019> train<00:03:34.230> your

00:03:34.310 --> 00:03:34.320 
to give you a chance to train your

00:03:34.320 --> 00:03:36.530 
to give you a chance to train your
triceps<00:03:34.739> more<00:03:34.890> often<00:03:35.280> but<00:03:35.820> if<00:03:35.940> you<00:03:36.030> go<00:03:36.180> really

00:03:36.530 --> 00:03:36.540 
triceps more often but if you go really

00:03:36.540 --> 00:03:38.390 
triceps more often but if you go really
really<00:03:36.750> heavy<00:03:37.079> on<00:03:37.350> your<00:03:37.440> tricep<00:03:37.829> increase

00:03:38.390 --> 00:03:38.400 
really heavy on your tricep increase

00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:40.430 
really heavy on your tricep increase
intensity<00:03:38.760> like<00:03:38.970> Norfolk<00:03:39.329> gonna<00:03:39.989> be<00:03:40.110> solved

00:03:40.430 --> 00:03:40.440 
intensity like Norfolk gonna be solved

00:03:40.440 --> 00:03:41.960 
intensity like Norfolk gonna be solved
for<00:03:40.560> at<00:03:40.650> least<00:03:40.799> three<00:03:41.070> days<00:03:41.190> then<00:03:41.700> don't

00:03:41.960 --> 00:03:41.970 
for at least three days then don't

00:03:41.970 --> 00:03:43.250 
for at least three days then don't
forget<00:03:42.060> that<00:03:42.299> you<00:03:42.359> also<00:03:42.540> gotta<00:03:42.720> train<00:03:42.959> chest

00:03:43.250 --> 00:03:43.260 
forget that you also gotta train chest

00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:45.380 
forget that you also gotta train chest
you<00:03:43.829> gotta<00:03:43.980> train<00:03:44.190> soldiers<00:03:44.489> and<00:03:44.880> all<00:03:45.239> these

00:03:45.380 --> 00:03:45.390 
you gotta train soldiers and all these

00:03:45.390 --> 00:03:47.509 
you gotta train soldiers and all these
movements<00:03:45.660> also<00:03:46.079> incorporate<00:03:46.980> your<00:03:47.040> triceps

00:03:47.509 --> 00:03:47.519 
movements also incorporate your triceps

00:03:47.519 --> 00:03:49.699 
movements also incorporate your triceps
so<00:03:47.730> I'll<00:03:48.420> say<00:03:48.750> it<00:03:48.810> depends<00:03:49.109> on<00:03:49.170> your<00:03:49.260> goal<00:03:49.440> if

00:03:49.699 --> 00:03:49.709 
so I'll say it depends on your goal if

00:03:49.709 --> 00:03:50.990 
so I'll say it depends on your goal if
your<00:03:50.040> goal<00:03:50.220> is<00:03:50.250> like<00:03:50.430> me<00:03:50.730> to<00:03:50.880> have<00:03:50.970> a

00:03:50.990 --> 00:03:51.000 
your goal is like me to have a

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:53.810 
your goal is like me to have a
separation<00:03:51.600> between<00:03:51.859> each<00:03:52.859> head<00:03:53.160> I<00:03:53.370> would<00:03:53.640> say

00:03:53.810 --> 00:03:53.820 
separation between each head I would say

00:03:53.820 --> 00:03:57.080 
separation between each head I would say
lower<00:03:54.269> the<00:03:54.420> weight<00:03:54.570> right<00:03:55.850> get<00:03:56.850> rid<00:03:56.940> of<00:03:56.970> your

00:03:57.080 --> 00:03:57.090 
lower the weight right get rid of your

00:03:57.090 --> 00:03:58.490 
lower the weight right get rid of your
ego<00:03:57.209> lured<00:03:57.540> away<00:03:57.660> meaning<00:03:58.019> if<00:03:58.140> you<00:03:58.170> lower<00:03:58.380> the

00:03:58.490 --> 00:03:58.500 
ego lured away meaning if you lower the

00:03:58.500 --> 00:04:00.380 
ego lured away meaning if you lower the
way<00:03:58.620> you<00:03:58.799> when<00:03:59.040> increase<00:03:59.370> the<00:03:59.519> reps<00:03:59.940> and<00:04:00.060> sets

00:04:00.380 --> 00:04:00.390 
way you when increase the reps and sets

00:04:00.390 --> 00:04:02.750 
way you when increase the reps and sets
to<00:04:00.690> balance<00:04:01.079> out<00:04:01.230> the<00:04:01.260> intensity<00:04:01.769> equation

00:04:02.750 --> 00:04:02.760 
to balance out the intensity equation

00:04:02.760 --> 00:04:06.470 
to balance out the intensity equation
and<00:04:04.640> train<00:04:05.640> your<00:04:05.730> tries<00:04:05.910> to<00:04:06.060> frequently

00:04:06.470 --> 00:04:06.480 
and train your tries to frequently

00:04:06.480 --> 00:04:08.930 
and train your tries to frequently
that's<00:04:06.989> one<00:04:07.140> reason<00:04:07.290> why<00:04:07.440> my<00:04:07.709> last<00:04:08.609> roster

00:04:08.930 --> 00:04:08.940 
that's one reason why my last roster

00:04:08.940 --> 00:04:10.220 
that's one reason why my last roster
what<00:04:09.060> color<00:04:09.209> suit<00:04:09.390> you<00:04:09.510> guys<00:04:09.660> had<00:04:09.959> so<00:04:10.140> many

what color suit you guys had so many

00:04:10.230 --> 00:04:12.319 
what color suit you guys had so many
exercises<00:04:10.560> because<00:04:11.489> i<00:04:11.820> wasn't<00:04:12.000> going<00:04:12.180> too
