Hi Quilters, there's one thing I'd love to show you a little bit more

00:00:10.490 --> 00:00:15.550
detail than shows up in the book, our book, Crazy Shortcut Quilts.

00:00:15.550 --> 00:00:17.490
Now, if you've made these quilts

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:20.820
you know that they just go together super fast

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:23.260
and the quilt as you go process

00:00:23.260 --> 00:00:27.000
is a lot of fun. A lot of people are really enjoying it.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:31.980
The only thing that's a bit of a caveat, and Sarah and I run into this in our classes,

00:00:31.990 --> 00:00:36.150
where we've go very experienced quilters.

00:00:36.150 --> 00:00:39.400
They are used to using a "quilter's quarter inch",

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:42.740
which is really a pretty skinny quarter of an inch.

00:00:42.740 --> 00:00:46.260
And when we are doing our sashing

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:51.040
it's very important that you use either a true quarter-inch seam

00:00:51.040 --> 00:00:54.430
or even maybe just a little bit of a fat quarter inch.

00:00:54.430 --> 00:00:59.540
I'd like to give you a close up and show you exactly what I mean by that. Let's take a better look.

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:03.770
See how I've lined up the ruler here? I've got my needle down

00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:06.600
in the stitching line and I used a white thread so that

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:10.570
you'd be able to see it here. This quarter of an inch line is

00:01:10.570 --> 00:01:13.760
lined up with the fabric underneath it.

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:18.470
Now, because you can see that little bit of white thread

00:01:18.470 --> 00:01:22.370
you can tell it's right on the quarter of an inch line.

00:01:22.370 --> 00:01:26.320
As a matter fact it might even be just a hair wider.

00:01:26.320 --> 00:01:29.840
Okay, that's it right there.

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:33.790
That's what you want to do. Use a real one quarter of an inch.

00:01:33.790 --> 00:01:38.400
Not a traditional quilters scant quarter of an inch.

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:42.130
And when you use a regular quarter of an inch seam,

00:01:42.130 --> 00:01:47.310
your sashing seams will lie perfectly, okay.

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:48.860
Thank you so much for watching.

00:01:48.860 --> 00:01:48.880
Thanks for checking that out. 
Thank you so much for watching.

Thanks for checking that out.

I really appreciate everybody who is making quilts and enjoying our book,

the Crazy Shortcut Quilts and I encourage you to check back here often.

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:05.980
I've got a few surprises lined up. I'm working on some new quilts

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:07.350
and a few new designs.

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:10.510
This is one that Sarah made and it's coming up soon.

00:02:10.510 --> 00:02:12.220
So, check back with us, 

00:02:12.230 --> 00:02:16.560
