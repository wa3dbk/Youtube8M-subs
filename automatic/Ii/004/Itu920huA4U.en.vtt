00:00:07.700 --> 00:00:11.519
 lexin end 

00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:16.619
 question from twitter from the user is the best 

00:00:11.519 --> 00:00:19.020
 hey batman if battlefield 3 won't 

00:00:16.619 --> 00:00:22.800
 sell incentive will affect it 

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:25.260
 sales up the question is how many copies 

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:26.240
 the game will be sold on pc and rowing soul 

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:29.609
 Anapa throughout 

00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:33.329
 they answer about ten percent of 

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:36.980
 total sales stealth show game 

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:41.640
 goes to playstation 3 on x-box and on 

00:00:36.980 --> 00:00:43.559
 pkm younger son took it and I predicted 

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:45.989
 that total sales will be around 8 

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:48.710
 million copies so the players on 

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:51.960
 pc will buy about 800 thousand copies of the game 

00:00:48.710 --> 00:00:54.570
 oldos half 400,000 might be 

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:56.219
 filed through steam and since electronics 

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:58.980
 Arts plans to sell the game only 

00:00:56.219 --> 00:01:03.870
 through origin she will lose say about 

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:05.760
 100 thousand customers thundered pc games I 

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:07.770
 I doubt very much that for players on pk 

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:09.960
 prove to be a problem to use 

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:13.500
 origin to buy this game game for 

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:16.229
 water to have to download a new client 

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:20.640
 set it start an account and 

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:22.320
 all that fat casia so I think 

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:24.150
 about 100,000 copies sold they 

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:26.130
 lose but compared to eight 

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:29.610
 by millions this figure doesn't seem so 

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:32.460
 big obviously i'm trying 

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:34.409
 I can not promote origin with yet 

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:37.590
 sure to say what is their ultimate 

00:01:34.409 --> 00:01:41.310
 the goal is one of them is definitely an extension 

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:42.990
 online functionality them and mr bye 

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:45.030
 that their only and main argument 

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:47.100
 against a competitor is a withdrawal from 

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:48.899
 catalog steam own content 

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:51.119
 Now electronics RC and precisely this 

00:01:48.899 --> 00:01:53.189
 deals about himself as for 

00:01:51.119 --> 00:01:55.439
 battlefield 3 it doesn't hurt him 

00:01:53.189 --> 00:01:56.909
 if it were about less promoted 

00:01:55.439 --> 00:01:59.399
 tightly only to sc 

00:01:56.909 --> 00:02:00.930
 it would hit his sales see 

00:01:59.399 --> 00:02:02.090
 how the situation will develop 

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:04.329
 she even 

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:04.329
