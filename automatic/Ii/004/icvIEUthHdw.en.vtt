00:02:42.220 --> 00:02:47.850 
here then you want to take a number one
of<00:02:42.310> these<00:02:42.490> and<00:02:43.470> put<00:02:44.470> it<00:02:44.710> in<00:02:45.010> here<00:02:45.910> put<00:02:46.620> it<00:02:47.620> there

00:02:47.850 --> 00:02:47.860 
of these and put it in here put it there

00:02:47.860 --> 00:02:52.560 
of these and put it in here put it there
okay<00:02:48.610> and<00:02:48.640> that's<00:02:50.220> what<00:02:51.220> I<00:02:51.400> don't<00:02:51.640> know<00:02:51.730> that's

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:52.570 
okay and that's what I don't know that's

00:02:52.570 --> 00:02:54.180 
okay and that's what I don't know that's
definitely<00:02:52.780> not<00:02:53.050> the<00:02:53.170> right<00:02:53.200> hat<00:02:53.560> that's

00:02:54.180 --> 00:02:54.190 
definitely not the right hat that's

00:02:54.190 --> 00:02:56.310 
definitely not the right hat that's
definitely<00:02:54.550> not<00:02:54.640> a<00:02:54.700> bite<00:02:54.940> handle<00:02:55.300> my<00:02:55.990> design

00:02:56.310 --> 00:02:56.320 
definitely not a bite handle my design

00:02:56.320 --> 00:02:58.110 
definitely not a bite handle my design
would<00:02:56.500> that<00:02:56.740> book<00:02:56.980> pretty<00:02:57.310> much<00:02:57.490> nearly

00:02:58.110 --> 00:02:58.120 
would that book pretty much nearly

00:02:58.120 --> 00:03:01.140 
would that book pretty much nearly
always<00:02:58.420> give<00:02:58.780> you<00:02:58.870> a<00:02:58.900> bite<00:02:59.140> handle<00:02:59.560> if<00:02:59.910> you<00:03:00.910> do

00:03:01.140 --> 00:03:01.150 
always give you a bite handle if you do

00:03:01.150 --> 00:03:04.290 
always give you a bite handle if you do
it<00:03:01.270> correctly<00:03:01.630> if<00:03:02.290> you<00:03:02.350> don't<00:03:02.650> then<00:03:02.860> well<00:03:03.300> push

00:03:04.290 --> 00:03:04.300 
it correctly if you don't then well push

00:03:04.300 --> 00:03:06.090 
it correctly if you don't then well push
in<00:03:04.480> one<00:03:04.660> side<00:03:04.930> in<00:03:05.080> a<00:03:05.200> bit<00:03:05.380> will<00:03:05.620> pretty<00:03:06.010> much

00:03:06.090 --> 00:03:06.100 
in one side in a bit will pretty much

00:03:06.100 --> 00:03:09.450 
in one side in a bit will pretty much
help<00:03:06.430> with<00:03:06.550> it<00:03:06.730> so<00:03:07.350> this<00:03:08.350> side<00:03:08.560> pushed<00:03:08.950> in<00:03:09.100> tiny

00:03:09.450 --> 00:03:09.460 
help with it so this side pushed in tiny

00:03:09.460 --> 00:03:17.610 
help with it so this side pushed in tiny
bit<00:03:15.570> now<00:03:16.570> you<00:03:16.600> want<00:03:16.900> to<00:03:16.960> repeat<00:03:17.260> that<00:03:17.410> process

00:03:17.610 --> 00:03:17.620 
bit now you want to repeat that process

00:03:17.620 --> 00:03:21.690 
bit now you want to repeat that process
again<00:03:17.980> so<00:03:18.430> I'll<00:03:18.850> be<00:03:19.240> back<00:03:19.510> one<00:03:19.810> done<00:03:20.080> that<00:03:20.700> by

00:03:21.690 --> 00:03:21.700 
again so I'll be back one done that by

00:03:21.700 --> 00:03:24.140 
again so I'll be back one done that by
the<00:03:21.760> way<00:03:21.940> a<00:03:21.970> good<00:03:22.330> design<00:03:22.690> to<00:03:22.720> do<00:03:22.990> it<00:03:23.140> is<00:03:23.350> to<00:03:23.710> do

00:03:24.140 --> 00:03:24.150 
the way a good design to do it is to do

00:03:24.150 --> 00:03:27.600 
the way a good design to do it is to do
one<00:03:25.150> of<00:03:25.480> them<00:03:25.720> without<00:03:26.380> the<00:03:26.770> bar<00:03:26.980> and<00:03:27.250> then<00:03:27.370> one

00:03:27.600 --> 00:03:27.610 
one of them without the bar and then one

00:03:27.610 --> 00:03:30.210 
one of them without the bar and then one
of<00:03:27.700> them<00:03:27.820> with<00:03:28.060> the<00:03:28.240> bar<00:03:28.450> so<00:03:29.410> that<00:03:29.650> you<00:03:29.800> know<00:03:29.950> if

00:03:30.210 --> 00:03:30.220 
of them with the bar so that you know if

00:03:30.220 --> 00:03:33.180 
of them with the bar so that you know if
you<00:03:30.430> press<00:03:30.730> it<00:03:30.850> in<00:03:30.970> one<00:03:31.330> of<00:03:31.360> them<00:03:31.570> is<00:03:31.690> gonna<00:03:32.190> not

00:03:33.180 --> 00:03:33.190 
you press it in one of them is gonna not

00:03:33.190 --> 00:03:35.760 
you press it in one of them is gonna not
push<00:03:33.400> down<00:03:33.640> but<00:03:33.820> the<00:03:33.910> other<00:03:34.090> one<00:03:34.270> will<00:03:34.620> so<00:03:35.620> it

00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:35.770 
push down but the other one will so it

00:03:35.770 --> 00:03:37.860 
push down but the other one will so it
can<00:03:36.070> help<00:03:36.400> you<00:03:36.760> hopefully<00:03:37.360> through<00:03:37.510> on<00:03:37.660> it<00:03:37.840> and

00:03:37.860 --> 00:03:37.870 
can help you hopefully through on it and

00:03:37.870 --> 00:03:43.970 
can help you hopefully through on it and
not<00:03:38.970> need<00:03:39.970> to<00:03:40.060> worry<00:03:40.270> about<00:03:40.480> a<00:03:40.900> lot<00:03:41.200> of<00:03:41.260> it<00:03:41.580> okay

00:03:43.970 --> 00:03:43.980 
not need to worry about a lot of it okay

00:03:43.980 --> 00:03:48.900 
not need to worry about a lot of it okay
okay<00:03:45.010> I'm<00:03:45.220> back<00:03:45.730> with<00:03:46.060> my<00:03:46.360> two<00:03:46.900> pieces<00:03:47.610> so<00:03:48.610> now

00:03:48.900 --> 00:03:48.910 
okay I'm back with my two pieces so now

00:03:48.910 --> 00:03:53.580 
okay I'm back with my two pieces so now
you<00:03:49.870> have<00:03:49.990> two<00:03:50.560> ways<00:03:51.310> of<00:03:51.700> connecting<00:03:52.180> these<00:03:52.630> so

00:03:53.580 --> 00:03:53.590 
you have two ways of connecting these so

00:03:53.590 --> 00:03:55.770 
you have two ways of connecting these so
this<00:03:53.770> is<00:03:54.040> ten<00:03:54.370> pieces<00:03:54.640> I'm<00:03:55.210> going<00:03:55.480> to<00:03:55.570> show<00:03:55.720> you

00:03:55.770 --> 00:03:55.780 
this is ten pieces I'm going to show you

00:03:55.780 --> 00:03:59.490 
this is ten pieces I'm going to show you
how<00:03:56.110> it's<00:03:56.920> ten<00:03:57.190> pieces<00:03:57.660> so<00:03:58.660> you<00:03:59.200> can<00:03:59.380> either

00:03:59.490 --> 00:03:59.500 
how it's ten pieces so you can either

00:03:59.500 --> 00:04:02.190 
how it's ten pieces so you can either
connect<00:04:00.280> them<00:04:00.720> like<00:04:01.720> that

00:04:02.190 --> 00:04:02.200 
connect them like that

00:04:02.200 --> 00:04:05.610 
connect them like that
right<00:04:02.530> I<00:04:02.680> should<00:04:02.710> put<00:04:02.950> the<00:04:03.040> door<00:04:03.190> like<00:04:03.340> that<00:04:04.620> so

00:04:05.610 --> 00:04:05.620 
right I should put the door like that so

00:04:05.620 --> 00:04:07.950 
right I should put the door like that so
you<00:04:05.680> could<00:04:06.100> connect<00:04:06.730> them<00:04:07.000> so<00:04:07.300> that<00:04:07.630> they<00:04:07.810> both

00:04:07.950 --> 00:04:07.960 
you could connect them so that they both

00:04:07.960 --> 00:04:10.170 
you could connect them so that they both
face<00:04:08.200> the<00:04:08.350> right<00:04:08.530> way<00:04:08.740> connect<00:04:09.610> them<00:04:09.730> on<00:04:09.970> top

00:04:10.170 --> 00:04:10.180 
face the right way connect them on top

00:04:10.180 --> 00:04:11.730 
face the right way connect them on top
of<00:04:10.240> each<00:04:10.390> other<00:04:10.600> so<00:04:10.720> that<00:04:10.990> there's<00:04:11.230> no

00:04:11.730 --> 00:04:11.740 
of each other so that there's no

00:04:11.740 --> 00:04:16.830 
of each other so that there's no
problems<00:04:12.459> here<00:04:13.470> okay<00:04:14.470> or<00:04:15.310> you<00:04:16.180> connect<00:04:16.630> them

00:04:16.830 --> 00:04:16.840 
problems here okay or you connect them

00:04:16.840 --> 00:04:20.699 
problems here okay or you connect them
like<00:04:17.520> so<00:04:18.520> that<00:04:18.730> one<00:04:19.239> of<00:04:19.330> them<00:04:19.480> has<00:04:19.750> one<00:04:20.200> of<00:04:20.590> them

00:04:20.699 --> 00:04:20.709 
like so that one of them has one of them

00:04:20.709 --> 00:04:22.800 
like so that one of them has one of them
is<00:04:20.799> a<00:04:20.830> bit<00:04:21.100> for<00:04:21.549> what<00:04:21.790> more<00:04:22.090> forward<00:04:22.540> than<00:04:22.570> the

00:04:22.800 --> 00:04:22.810 
is a bit for what more forward than the

00:04:22.810 --> 00:04:27.720 
is a bit for what more forward than the
other<00:04:24.540> so<00:04:25.540> that's<00:04:26.169> how<00:04:26.440> I<00:04:26.470> defer<00:04:26.950> to<00:04:26.979> have<00:04:27.280> my

00:04:27.720 --> 00:04:27.730 
other so that's how I defer to have my

00:04:27.730 --> 00:04:29.840 
other so that's how I defer to have my
but<00:04:28.480> you<00:04:28.570> can<00:04:28.720> have<00:04:28.840> it<00:04:28.870> the<00:04:29.050> other<00:04:29.200> way<00:04:29.380> if<00:04:29.560> you

00:04:29.840 --> 00:04:29.850 
but you can have it the other way if you

00:04:29.850 --> 00:04:34.190 
but you can have it the other way if you
prefer<00:04:30.850> to<00:04:31.060> have<00:04:31.270> you<00:04:31.690> know<00:04:31.840> an<00:04:32.110> equal<00:04:33.040> side

00:04:34.190 --> 00:04:34.200 
prefer to have you know an equal side
