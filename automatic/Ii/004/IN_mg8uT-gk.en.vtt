this you can set a default start so this

00:01:02.860 --> 00:01:07.560 
this you can set a default start so this
will<00:01:03.070> open<00:01:03.190> a<00:01:03.460> nine<00:01:03.670> at<00:01:04.089> close<00:01:04.360> at<00:01:04.540> nine<00:01:05.310> or<00:01:06.570> you

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:07.570 
will open a nine at close at nine or you

00:01:07.570 --> 00:01:09.510 
will open a nine at close at nine or you
can<00:01:07.720> also<00:01:07.869> set<00:01:08.229> them<00:01:08.380> by<00:01:08.560> day<00:01:08.619> so<00:01:08.829> let's<00:01:09.310> say

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:09.520 
can also set them by day so let's say

00:01:09.520 --> 00:01:12.090 
can also set them by day so let's say
that<00:01:09.549> we<00:01:10.149> want<00:01:10.390> Sundays<00:01:10.960> to<00:01:11.229> be<00:01:11.350> closed<00:01:11.619> so<00:01:11.950> we

00:01:13.289 --> 00:01:13.299 
would the setup for it

00:01:13.299 --> 00:01:15.630 
would the setup for it
follow<00:01:13.600> clock<00:01:13.899> to<00:01:14.439> 12<00:01:14.710> o'clock<00:01:14.829> so<00:01:15.250> it<00:01:15.340> opens
