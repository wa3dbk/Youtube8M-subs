00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:37.200 
actually handle the device for now let's

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:38.360 
actually handle the device for now let's
start<00:00:37.380> off<00:00:37.500> with<00:00:37.620> gaming<00:00:37.980> and<00:00:38.100> we're<00:00:38.190> going<00:00:38.309> to

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:38.370 
start off with gaming and we're going to

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:40.880 
start off with gaming and we're going to
start<00:00:38.489> off<00:00:38.640> with<00:00:38.700> Real<00:00:39.030> Racing<00:00:39.270> 3<00:00:39.620> you'll<00:00:40.620> see

temple<00:01:40.020> run<00:01:40.170> 2<00:01:40.200> is<00:01:40.530> a<00:01:40.830> very<00:01:41.250> basic<00:01:41.630> arcade<00:01:42.630> sort

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:43.200 
temple run 2 is a very basic arcade sort

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:45.350 
temple run 2 is a very basic arcade sort
of<00:01:43.320> game<00:01:43.530> the<00:01:43.740> graphics<00:01:44.520> laid<00:01:45.030> out<00:01:45.180> perfectly

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:45.360 
of game the graphics laid out perfectly

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:47.570 
of game the graphics laid out perfectly
and<00:01:45.900> gameplay<00:01:46.320> is<00:01:46.470> easy<00:01:46.770> either<00:01:47.070> with<00:01:47.369> one

00:01:47.570 --> 00:01:47.580 
and gameplay is easy either with one

00:01:47.580 --> 00:01:49.550 
and gameplay is easy either with one
hand<00:01:47.790> or<00:01:48.060> with<00:01:48.090> both<00:01:48.390> hands<00:01:48.630> I<00:01:48.869> do<00:01:49.290> have

00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:49.560 
hand or with both hands I do have

hand or with both hands I do have
slightly<00:01:49.799> big<00:01:50.100> hands<00:01:50.430> so<00:01:50.640> playing<00:01:50.970> with<00:01:51.060> one

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:51.180

slightly big hands so playing with one
hand<00:01:51.420> is<00:01:51.570> easy<00:01:51.810> but<00:01:52.140> I<00:01:52.200> can<00:01:52.350> imagine<00:01:52.440> if<00:01:52.740> you

00:01:52.820 --> 00:01:52.830 
hand is easy but I can imagine if you

00:01:52.830 --> 00:01:55.219

this device but it quit many times it

00:03:40.790 --> 00:03:43.030 
this device but it quit many times it
would<00:03:40.880> verify<00:03:41.120> the<00:03:41.330> files<00:03:41.600> and<00:03:41.870> it<00:03:41.960> would<00:03:42.140> quit

00:03:43.030 --> 00:03:43.040 
would verify the files and it would quit

00:03:43.040 --> 00:03:45.130 
would verify the files and it would quit
on<00:03:43.700> the<00:03:43.880> divisor<00:03:44.150> to<00:03:44.300> check<00:03:44.510> the<00:03:44.630> license<00:03:44.990> and
