shadowed by a giant trevally this drag
trevally<00:01:26.520> is<00:01:26.939> obviously<00:01:27.689> using<00:01:28.080> the<00:01:28.170> manta<00:01:28.530> as

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:28.680 
trevally is obviously using the manta as

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:31.999 
trevally is obviously using the manta as
a<00:01:28.710> screen<00:01:29.780> getting<00:01:30.780> the<00:01:31.229> manta<00:01:31.560> in<00:01:31.680> between

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:38.749 
so then what it does spot somebody it
can<00:01:36.150> burst<00:01:36.750> out<00:01:37.020> from<00:01:37.320> behind<00:01:37.890> the<00:01:38.189> manta<00:01:38.520> and

00:01:38.749 --> 00:01:38.759

different<00:02:09.929> colors<00:02:10.289> on<00:02:10.590> the<00:02:10.769> reef<00:02:10.890> itself<00:02:13.819> and

00:02:14.809 --> 00:02:14.819 
different colors on the reef itself and

00:02:14.819 --> 00:02:16.759 
different colors on the reef itself and
the<00:02:15.330> cool<00:02:15.510> thing<00:02:15.720> was<00:02:15.840> about<00:02:16.110> this<00:02:16.260> dive<00:02:16.470> site

00:02:16.759 --> 00:02:16.769 
the cool thing was about this dive site

00:02:16.769 --> 00:02:19.580 
the cool thing was about this dive site
is<00:02:17.480> we<00:02:18.480> didn't<00:02:18.660> have<00:02:18.780> to<00:02:18.870> go<00:02:18.959> very<00:02:19.110> far<00:02:19.319> on<00:02:19.380> this

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:19.590 
is we didn't have to go very far on this

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:22.520 
is we didn't have to go very far on this
dive<00:02:19.830> we<00:02:20.250> jumped<00:02:20.940> in<00:02:21.060> we<00:02:21.840> went<00:02:22.050> down<00:02:22.230> to<00:02:22.410> about

00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:22.530 
dive we jumped in we went down to about

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:25.640 
dive we jumped in we went down to about
15<00:02:22.950> meters<00:02:23.310> and<00:02:23.760> then<00:02:24.110> stayed<00:02:25.110> within<00:02:25.319> about<00:02:25.620> a

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:25.650 
15 meters and then stayed within about a

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:29.090 
15 meters and then stayed within about a
100<00:02:26.190> meter<00:02:26.630> radius<00:02:27.630> the<00:02:28.019> internet<00:02:28.470> 60<00:02:28.799> minutes

00:02:29.090 --> 00:02:29.100 
100 meter radius the internet 60 minutes

00:02:29.100 --> 00:02:32.000 
100 meter radius the internet 60 minutes
the<00:02:29.310> mantas<00:02:30.209> would<00:02:30.390> go<00:02:30.540> off<00:02:30.690> one<00:02:30.989> way<00:02:31.019> they

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:32.010 
the mantas would go off one way they

00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:33.830 
the mantas would go off one way they
would<00:02:32.190> disappear<00:02:32.340> for<00:02:33.090> a<00:02:33.150> few<00:02:33.209> minutes<00:02:33.660> and

00:02:33.830 --> 00:02:33.840 
would disappear for a few minutes and

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:35.809 
would disappear for a few minutes and
then<00:02:33.959> they<00:02:34.019> would<00:02:34.350> come<00:02:34.400> swooping<00:02:35.400> back<00:02:35.580> in

00:02:35.809 --> 00:02:35.819 
then they would come swooping back in

00:02:35.819 --> 00:02:38.390 
then they would come swooping back in
the<00:02:35.940> other<00:02:36.090> way<00:02:36.560> sometimes<00:02:37.560> very<00:02:37.890> very<00:02:38.069> close

00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:38.400 
the other way sometimes very very close

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:53.259 
the other way sometimes very very close
sometimes<00:02:39.209> a<00:02:39.360> little<00:02:39.450> bit<00:02:39.690> further<00:02:39.959> away

00:02:53.259 --> 00:02:53.269 

00:02:53.269 --> 00:02:55.520 

another<00:02:54.269> cool<00:02:54.510> encounter<00:02:54.870> that<00:02:54.959> I<00:02:55.079> had<00:02:55.260> on<00:02:55.409> the

00:03:05.509 --> 00:03:05.519 
close to my camera they wanted probably

00:03:05.519 --> 00:03:07.190 
close to my camera they wanted probably
three<00:03:05.730> four<00:03:05.909> very<00:03:06.359> close<00:03:06.540> passes<00:03:07.019> to<00:03:07.170> me

00:03:09.530 --> 00:03:11.920 
showed no fear of me whatsoever
just<00:03:10.530> like<00:03:10.650> the<00:03:10.769> mantas<00:03:11.069> in<00:03:11.189> the<00:03:11.280> dockside

00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:11.930 
just like the mantas in the dockside

00:03:11.930 --> 00:03:16.849 
just like the mantas in the dockside
they<00:03:12.930> do<00:03:13.099> quite<00:03:14.099> often<00:03:14.280> see<00:03:15.079> divers<00:03:16.079> on<00:03:16.469> this

00:03:16.849 --> 00:03:16.859
