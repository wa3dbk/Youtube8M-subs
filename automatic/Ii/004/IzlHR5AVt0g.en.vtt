00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:31.110 
720p HD video and so the media aspects

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:32.179 
720p HD video and so the media aspects
of<00:01:31.229> the<00:01:31.350> product<00:01:31.619> haven't<00:01:31.829> really<00:01:32.040> been

00:01:32.179 --> 00:01:32.189 
of the product haven't really been

00:01:32.189 --> 00:01:35.840 
of the product haven't really been
boosted<00:01:33.119> up<00:01:33.210> as<00:01:34.079> well<00:01:34.460> up<00:01:35.460> here<00:01:35.640> at<00:01:35.729> the<00:01:35.790> top

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:35.850 
boosted up as well up here at the top

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:37.399 
boosted up as well up here at the top
you<00:01:36.210> have<00:01:36.390> a<00:01:36.420> three-and-a-half<00:01:37.200> millimeter

00:01:37.399 --> 00:01:37.409 
you have a three-and-a-half millimeter

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:40.370 
you have a three-and-a-half millimeter
hits<00:01:38.159> a<00:01:38.250> check<00:01:38.460> and<00:01:38.700> the<00:01:38.880> silent<00:01:39.600> switch<00:01:40.110> as

00:01:40.370 --> 00:01:40.380 
hits a check and the silent switch as

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:41.899 
hits a check and the silent switch as
well<00:01:40.560> so<00:01:40.770> it<00:01:40.860> keeps<00:01:40.979> like<00:01:41.310> some<00:01:41.490> of<00:01:41.579> those<00:01:41.640> nice

00:01:41.899 --> 00:01:41.909 
well so it keeps like some of those nice

00:01:41.909 --> 00:01:44.090 
well so it keeps like some of those nice
features<00:01:42.299> with<00:01:42.509> the<00:01:42.720> web<00:01:43.049> with<00:01:43.350> webos<00:01:43.590> and

features with the web with webos and

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:46.370 
features with the web with webos and
then<00:01:44.759> it<00:01:45.030> has<00:01:45.149> a<00:01:45.180> great<00:01:45.540> slide<00:01:45.869> out<00:01:46.020> keyboard

00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:46.380 
then it has a great slide out keyboard

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:49.249
