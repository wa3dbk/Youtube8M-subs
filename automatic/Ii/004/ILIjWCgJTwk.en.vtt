 hello that such friends my name is Jorge and 

00:00:14.309 --> 00:00:19.320
 you are in your channel up the review 

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:21.119
 this time I'm going to bring a very tweet 

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:23.550
 father is something that we all should have 

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:26.189
 our positive and it's a tweet because 

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:27.779
 is for the camera with this click what 

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:30.869
 we will be able to do is that we 

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:32.399
 integrates the option of slow motion to 60 

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:35.100
 frames per second in case 

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:37.380
 have iphone 5 and 30 frames per 

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:40.020
 second in case you have an iphone 

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:43.200
 4 iphone 4s and ipad 2 the click is called 

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:45.180
 slow mode this is the repo of big box is 

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:47.129
 a totally free tweet you're not going to 

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:50.550
 have to pay for it or cracked base 

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:55.590
 well here it's going to look like you're going 

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:57.360
 to be able to install what the slow is like 

00:00:55.590 --> 00:01:00.899
 it just showed that it's slow motion 

00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:02.640
 you will be able to edit what part of the video 

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:04.890
 will have slow motion and the truth 

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:07.510
 has a very good definition here in the 

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:12.850
 Important notes is what I love you 

00:01:07.510 --> 00:01:14.620
 good the iphone4 4s ipad2 ipad 3 

00:01:12.850 --> 00:01:16.990
 they do not support 60 frames per 

00:01:14.620 --> 00:01:18.790
 second and those are the limitations of 

00:01:16.990 --> 00:01:22.240
 hardware or the processor that they have 

00:01:18.790 --> 00:01:24.010
 does not have to pull so much good says that 

00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:26.620
 here suddenly you may have a 

00:01:24.010 --> 00:01:28.930
 crash for example me when I install it and 

00:01:26.620 --> 00:01:30.790
 I tried and turned on my camera my camera was 

00:01:28.930 --> 00:01:33.880
 I looked totally dark but if I took 

00:01:30.790 --> 00:01:35.530
 a picture looked perfectly good 

00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:38.590
 you're just going to have to close your 

00:01:35.530 --> 00:01:40.510
 camera and reopen it says that of 

00:01:38.590 --> 00:01:42.880
 you can suddenly in the front chamber 

00:01:40.510 --> 00:01:44.860
 you may suddenly have a small 

00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:47.140
 lag but that's a fix that will soon go to 

00:01:44.860 --> 00:01:48.610
 correct on my part this would be all you 

00:01:47.140 --> 00:01:51.400
 I recommend checking the other videos 

00:01:48.610 --> 00:01:52.870
 masters of the mobile box that is a tweet 

00:01:51.400 --> 00:01:55.990
 that will allow you to watch movies from 

00:01:52.870 --> 00:01:58.300
 premiere in high definition with a single 

00:01:55.990 --> 00:02:00.040
 inconvenience is in English but not 

00:01:58.300 --> 00:02:02.170
 I think he's going to have a lot of trouble with 

00:02:00.040 --> 00:02:05.010
 that on my part would be everything I have in 

00:02:02.170 --> 00:02:05.010
 the next video
