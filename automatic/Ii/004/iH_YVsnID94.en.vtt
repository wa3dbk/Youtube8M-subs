00:00:09.320 --> 00:00:14.700
 occupational disability 

00:00:12.620 --> 00:00:16.770
 I hear constantly against myself 

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:18.480
 to secure my occupational disability but I am 

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:21.779
 still young I need something else 

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:23.670
 not or it still needs to be young and fit 

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:25.590
 but that does not have to stay that way 

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:27.689
 Consumer advocates were always 

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:29.720
 before that the risk of disability 

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:32.130
 to underestimate 

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:34.380
 agrees that, and if I have an accident 

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:36.300
 have or will get sick then I 

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:38.070
 not so fit and then his looks 

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:40.440
 future career no longer 

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:42.270
 so sure and an accident can yes 

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:44.430
 really happen to everyone and that's why 

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:46.469
 Everyone should protect themselves against it 

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:47.730
 and if I do not insure myself then 

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:50.910
 I'm sure I'll get something from the state 

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:53.129
 or the social service time maybe the 

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:55.440
 pension insurance is not or not enough 

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:58.079
 and only then if you are unable to work 

00:00:55.440 --> 00:01:00.300
 you and apprentices are especially hard hit 

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:01.649
 because you usually get nothing because 

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:04.010
 you have not been in the room long enough 

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:06.060
 pension insurance 

00:01:04.010 --> 00:01:06.840
 disability and fits now 

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:09.049
 again 

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:12.290
 So there is a difference between 

00:01:09.049 --> 00:01:14.490
 disability and disability 

00:01:12.290 --> 00:01:16.740
 Disability means that you are yours 

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:18.840
 no longer can exercise profession no matter whether 

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:20.430
 you are still in training or have 

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:22.710
 have learned from and at 

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:24.990
 disability later in the profession no 

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:27.180
 role because it comes whether and how much 

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:29.070
 ever work even can with 

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:30.060
 You can get a metal pension easily 

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:31.770
 to secure 

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:34.020
 you can in the context of 

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:35.490
 occupational pension or with 

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:37.829
 The metal pension offer one 

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:39.810
 independent private insurance for 

00:01:37.829 --> 00:01:41.970
 Young people the better for us 

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:44.579
 choice and how this works 

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:49.040
 you are young in the next show 

00:01:44.579 --> 00:01:49.040
