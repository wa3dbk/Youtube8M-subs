00:00:28.340 --> 00:00:31.060
 Euro 

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:29.470
 where we put the video title and the 

00:01:26.680 --> 00:01:34.630
 could gather images are 

00:01:29.470 --> 00:01:36.310
 again my strider video the planner 

00:01:34.630 --> 00:01:39.369
 have once again sent a model 

00:01:36.310 --> 00:01:41.080
 really what is very nice a sng 

00:01:39.369 --> 00:01:44.290
 the exact description can be found in 

00:01:41.080 --> 00:01:45.610
 the video description as little 

00:01:44.290 --> 00:01:48.340
 plan that camera look in it 

00:01:45.610 --> 00:01:50.800
 worth yes, and this model has it 

00:01:48.340 --> 00:01:52.240
 Just let me know because 

00:01:50.800 --> 00:01:55.210
 because it really is a damn good one 

00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:58.380
 processed model is and that is with 

00:01:55.210 --> 00:02:00.820
 Strider always such a thing 

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:01.780
 Here I can give the pranger full and 

00:02:00.820 --> 00:02:04.420
 quite agree 

00:02:01.780 --> 00:02:07.390
 that is really an absolute 

00:02:04.420 --> 00:02:13.840
 baby not only from the optics this 

00:02:07.390 --> 00:02:15.480
 arctic gc fan are really something 

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:18.610
 Other yes that's back in 

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:21.550
 exceptionally beautiful model and that 

00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:24.820
 the technical processing is right 

00:02:21.550 --> 00:02:26.440
 here's really the frame 

00:02:24.820 --> 00:02:31.989
 pressure makes us very clean 

00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:34.870
 no play and buttery sound 

00:02:31.989 --> 00:02:36.670
 can probably the knows the 

00:02:34.870 --> 00:02:37.630
 I walk in the church so far 

00:02:36.670 --> 00:02:42.870
 have experienced 

00:02:37.630 --> 00:02:42.870
 that is really nice 

00:02:43.819 --> 00:02:48.989
 yes, I still do not have one 

00:02:46.349 --> 00:02:50.849
 fight a year ago 

00:02:48.989 --> 00:02:53.130
 a year ago I would have thought so 

00:02:50.849 --> 00:02:54.989
 I had 1 since I was very much 

00:02:53.130 --> 00:02:58.380
 prepare 1 zuzulegen that was actually 

00:02:54.989 --> 00:02:59.630
 Unfortunately it was not planned that way either 

00:02:58.380 --> 00:03:03.239
 folded 

00:02:59.630 --> 00:03:06.269
 are a few reasons so the usual 

00:03:03.239 --> 00:03:09.060
 Do not knead down and especially the skin 

00:03:06.269 --> 00:03:10.890
 readiness was simply not there 

00:03:09.060 --> 00:03:13.950
 After all, you write with many people 

00:03:10.890 --> 00:03:16.290
 watch a lot of videos and the mass 

00:03:13.950 --> 00:03:18.630
 at strider knife 

00:03:16.290 --> 00:03:23.030
 but problems have just what the frame 

00:03:18.630 --> 00:03:24.810
 easy on those who are immense 

00:03:23.030 --> 00:03:27.700
 that has me pretty much 

00:03:24.810 --> 00:03:30.220
 always held 

00:03:27.700 --> 00:03:32.860
 and that's why I do not have scott before 

00:03:30.220 --> 00:03:36.310
 longer time times one in exchange 

00:03:32.860 --> 00:03:37.959
 offered contravention slowly but that 

00:03:36.310 --> 00:03:40.239
 I refused because thankfully 

00:03:37.959 --> 00:03:44.260
 I'm just the good processing 

00:03:40.239 --> 00:03:47.709
 from the revival behind the reasons 

00:03:44.260 --> 00:03:49.720
 why I'm not stripping off yet 

00:03:47.709 --> 00:03:53.569
 visually I think it's the coolest thing 

00:03:49.720 --> 00:03:56.030
 It is so on the market 

00:03:53.569 --> 00:03:58.010
 and I think they live off that 

00:03:56.030 --> 00:03:59.769
 Just share by von der 

00:03:58.010 --> 00:04:02.420
 coolness 

00:03:59.769 --> 00:04:04.159
 Personally, I now find the design 

00:04:02.420 --> 00:04:06.290
 everything is here 

00:04:04.159 --> 00:04:07.760
 I know nothing comparable and me 

00:04:06.290 --> 00:04:10.129
 finds lousy cool 

00:04:07.760 --> 00:04:12.920
 very successful I think next to the 

00:04:10.129 --> 00:04:14.930
 material choice also hold the handle 

00:04:12.920 --> 00:04:17.269
 I think that is very suitable 

00:04:14.930 --> 00:04:19.250
 makes not only visually but her 

00:04:17.269 --> 00:04:21.229
 but it really is a good good one 

00:04:19.250 --> 00:04:24.320
 suitable but otherwise pure 

00:04:21.229 --> 00:04:26.360
 full of performance, there is a lot 

00:04:24.320 --> 00:04:28.280
 much better knife also in the 

00:04:26.360 --> 00:04:28.820
 Much much cheaper knives are very much 

00:04:28.280 --> 00:04:32.750
 much better 

00:04:28.820 --> 00:04:34.849
 it can not be that and also the 

00:04:32.750 --> 00:04:37.750
 stability in the spyder knife like very much 

00:04:34.849 --> 00:04:39.860
 stable but are much more common 

00:04:37.750 --> 00:04:42.349
 for example, zero tolerance 

00:04:39.860 --> 00:04:44.900
 called the knife or the die 

00:04:42.349 --> 00:04:46.729
 cheap china knocker from trade dies 

00:04:44.900 --> 00:04:48.740
 that has been on the market for some time now 

00:04:46.729 --> 00:04:49.840
 Such are such chunks for under 

00:04:48.740 --> 00:04:53.120
 50 Euros 

00:04:49.840 --> 00:04:54.560
 which are also very very very stable so 

00:04:53.120 --> 00:04:58.220
 the stability can not say either 

00:04:54.560 --> 00:04:59.720
 it's somehow the whole thing 

00:04:58.220 --> 00:05:02.449
 myth the call behind it 

00:04:59.720 --> 00:05:04.039
 united with the one with the design and the 

00:05:02.449 --> 00:05:06.560
 make sure people use them 

00:05:04.039 --> 00:05:08.630
 Just buy a fair and go to this meadow 

00:05:06.560 --> 00:05:11.479
 absurd prices to pay for the 

00:05:08.630 --> 00:05:14.479
 is already the hammer yes my question 

00:05:11.479 --> 00:05:17.419
 now actually so so too the 

00:05:14.479 --> 00:05:18.889
 What do you think about that ? 

00:05:17.419 --> 00:05:21.979
 Share hot or not 

00:05:18.889 --> 00:05:23.840
 yes, you also find it pretty cool or 

00:05:21.979 --> 00:05:26.240
 we let you out just cold 

00:05:23.840 --> 00:05:30.400
 several and of the design that speaks you 

00:05:26.240 --> 00:05:34.550
 just not so tactical too 

00:05:30.400 --> 00:05:36.229
 aggressive then the price of the reference 

00:05:34.550 --> 00:05:38.449
 not so easy you do not get too 

00:05:36.229 --> 00:05:40.039
 every time strider 

00:05:38.449 --> 00:05:42.460
 that is not all in germany 

00:05:40.039 --> 00:05:42.460
 easy 

00:05:43.460 --> 00:05:49.729
 yes write in the comment 

00:05:45.169 --> 00:05:51.590
 be what you think I think 

00:05:49.729 --> 00:05:54.860
 very very interesting and and who 

00:05:51.590 --> 00:05:58.280
 I just enjoy making a video 

00:05:54.860 --> 00:06:01.910
 Answer made and tells 

00:05:58.280 --> 00:06:05.569
 little something I find really cool, I 

00:06:01.910 --> 00:06:08.080
 I really do not think that's great 

00:06:05.569 --> 00:06:08.080
 successful 

00:06:08.870 --> 00:06:13.940
 I 'll keep that in mind for a while 

00:06:10.340 --> 00:06:16.450
 then enjoy it back to the 

00:06:13.940 --> 00:06:16.450
 drama 

00:06:17.350 --> 00:06:25.540
 really awesome strider the die 

00:06:21.310 --> 00:06:26.800
 clearly polarize okay that's it 

00:06:25.540 --> 00:06:28.750
 then again, I am looking forward to more 

00:06:26.800 --> 00:06:32.850
 your comments will remain on your feedback 

00:06:28.750 --> 00:06:32.850
 healthy peace I'm out
