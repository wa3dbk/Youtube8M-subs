00:00:01.130 --> 00:00:10.599
 [Music] 

00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:10.599
 [Applause] 

00:00:16.369 --> 00:00:23.670
 in the specific case of the colors né 

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:25.980
 is a painful piece in a certain sense and 

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:28.199
 very clean at the same time because I 

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:31.309
 had received an order dodô paulo 

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:33.870
 clarinetista steps and joaquim abreito zito 

00:00:31.309 --> 00:00:35.430
 protectionist to make a piece was 

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:37.710
 very excited to make the piece in the middle 

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:40.350
 of the year I started to design the piece of mine 

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:42.750
 brother got injured and died 

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:45.120
 was 40 years old and had two years 

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:48.210
 I was a huge shocker. 

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:51.090
 So this one death I got was today. 

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:54.410
 caught it in music oh I'm not going 

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:57.600
 get to compose and I made or colors 

00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:59.640
 based on the term body which was a 

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:00.870
 a term that ended a work that I 

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:03.930
 I had done with it, it's his in mine. 

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:06.420
 adolescence a translation of blair that 

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:07.920
 he had done very interesting about 

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:10.170
 made her 

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:13.770
 he had translated a sonnet der and 

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:15.900
 had filtered that sonnet by dropping 

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:19.650
 syllables and words until the 

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:22.360
 talk until the last one on this 

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:25.650
 word color of the word heart 

00:01:22.360 --> 00:01:25.830
 [Music] 

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:28.900
 [Applause] 

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:28.900
 [Music] 

00:01:30.970 --> 00:01:37.159
 and is in fact a revisit of a 

00:01:34.250 --> 00:01:40.490
 another clarinet piece transforming 

00:01:37.159 --> 00:01:43.490
 the 4 elite seek and solo made of 13 

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:46.729
 small fragments that are revisited 

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:48.799
 in this extended part 

00:01:46.729 --> 00:01:51.259
 each time the clarinet is revisited and 

00:01:48.799 --> 00:01:53.020
 enters the universe of colors is a 

00:01:51.259 --> 00:01:57.069
 cry of pain as if it were an accident 

00:01:53.020 --> 00:01:58.810
 which tends to stretch to endure the 

00:01:57.069 --> 00:02:05.139
 resist life 

00:01:58.810 --> 00:02:05.139
 [Music] 

00:02:11.490 --> 00:02:18.400
 when he told me about the carnival son 

00:02:14.980 --> 00:02:19.750
 Look, I have a video that you do not have yet 

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:24.700
 name 

00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:27.880
 he's ready it was a meat one 

00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:30.930
 soft structure and a drill 

00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:30.930
 hard structure 

00:02:49.450 --> 00:02:55.989
 and then what happened happened 

00:02:52.959 --> 00:02:59.319
 when you drill the meat the drill stick 

00:02:55.989 --> 00:03:02.620
 this meat was light and then the video ends 

00:02:59.319 --> 00:03:06.519
 which is an allegorical relationship with the 

00:03:02.620 --> 00:03:09.910
 creation also with giving birth with the 

00:03:06.519 --> 00:03:10.780
 to give birth to life and the 

00:03:09.910 --> 00:03:39.080
 thought 

00:03:10.780 --> 00:03:39.080
 [Music] 

00:03:40.120 --> 00:03:45.650
 I already said if it will start white 

00:03:43.370 --> 00:03:49.069
 as if it were a liquid, right? 

00:03:45.650 --> 00:03:52.489
 and then we dripping another liquid 

00:03:49.069 --> 00:03:56.720
 red and then when it's red 

00:03:52.489 --> 00:04:03.780
 It's alright, red. We'll pass it by. 

00:03:56.720 --> 00:04:03.780
 [Music] 

00:04:08.760 --> 00:04:15.810
 [Music] 

00:04:11.780 --> 00:04:19.050
 so that first piece was a piece 

00:04:15.810 --> 00:04:21.300
 all built because of his music 

00:04:19.050 --> 00:04:24.780
 and the second was a video meeting 

00:04:21.300 --> 00:04:27.090
 already existed and that was great because 

00:04:24.780 --> 00:04:30.510
 This has to do with the life history and 

00:04:27.090 --> 00:04:34.110
 death also of beginning and end or of 

00:04:30.510 --> 00:04:37.350
 process that because it starts in white 

00:04:34.110 --> 00:04:38.350
 of milk matter and ends in white 

00:04:37.350 --> 00:05:02.119
 from light 

00:04:38.350 --> 00:05:02.119
