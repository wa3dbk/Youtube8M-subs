00:00:16.990 --> 00:00:17.000 
pick from one of I believe six

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:20.680

00:00:20.680 --> 00:00:20.690 
characters and they're all hitman and so

00:00:20.690 --> 00:00:24.100 
characters and they're all hitman and so
your<00:00:20.900> objective<00:00:21.260> in<00:00:21.440> the<00:00:21.560> game<00:00:21.740> is<00:00:22.010> to<00:00:23.110> kill
