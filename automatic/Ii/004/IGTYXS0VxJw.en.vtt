you probably know it goes on pretty

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:02.299 
you probably know it goes on pretty
evenly<00:01:00.270> you<00:01:00.510> let<00:01:00.719> it<00:01:00.840> dry<00:01:01.079> just<00:01:01.500> naturally<00:01:02.039> or

00:01:02.299 --> 00:01:02.309 
evenly you let it dry just naturally or

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:04.219 
evenly you let it dry just naturally or
you<00:01:02.430> can<00:01:02.550> let<00:01:02.640> it<00:01:02.699> dry<00:01:02.789> with<00:01:03.090> a<00:01:03.149> light<00:01:03.329> and<00:01:04.140> it

you can let it dry with a light and it

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:06.320 
you can let it dry with a light and it
usually<00:01:04.350> chips<00:01:04.890> after<00:01:05.339> a<00:01:05.369> couple<00:01:05.610> of<00:01:05.760> days<00:01:05.970> and

usually chips after a couple of days and
it's<00:01:06.479> usually<00:01:06.630> needs<00:01:06.990> to<00:01:07.170> be<00:01:07.290> redone<00:01:07.590> within

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:07.950

ten<00:01:08.189> to<00:01:08.340> fifteen<00:01:08.790> days<00:01:09.030> whereas<00:01:09.720> gel<00:01:09.990> nail

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:10.140 
ten to fifteen days whereas gel nail

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:11.870 
ten to fifteen days whereas gel nail
polish<00:01:10.350> technically<00:01:11.100> you<00:01:11.220> can<00:01:11.430> wear<00:01:11.640> it<00:01:11.729> until

00:01:16.249 --> 00:01:16.259 
filled kind of like acrylic now what's

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:18.200 
filled kind of like acrylic now what's
the<00:01:16.380> difference<00:01:16.680> in<00:01:16.799> composition<00:01:17.159> I<00:01:17.610> don't

Harden<00:01:36.299> and<00:01:36.479> make<00:01:36.750> this<00:01:36.960> gel<00:01:37.380> polish<00:01:37.829> more<00:01:38.189> of

Harden and make this gel polish more of
a<00:01:38.400> mass<00:01:38.640> and<00:01:39.030> so<00:01:39.450> it<00:01:39.540> is<00:01:39.659> a<00:01:39.689> little<00:01:39.960> bit

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:40.110 
a mass and so it is a little bit

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:41.859 
a mass and so it is a little bit
flexible<00:01:40.290> but<00:01:40.770> it<00:01:40.890> is<00:01:40.979> normally<00:01:41.310> much<00:01:41.460> thicker

00:01:41.859 --> 00:01:41.869 
flexible but it is normally much thicker

resistant to things like that because

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:50.749 
resistant to things like that because
the<00:01:48.630> gel<00:01:48.869> polish<00:01:49.079> is<00:01:49.470> like<00:01:49.680> a<00:01:49.710> jelly<00:01:50.070> texture

00:01:50.749 --> 00:01:50.759

00:01:52.999 --> 00:01:53.009 
if you take it off it literally comes

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:56.149 
off an appeal whereas regular nail
polish<00:01:54.750> comes<00:01:55.200> off<00:01:55.350> in<00:01:55.470> little<00:01:55.680> chunks<00:01:56.040> and

00:04:50.610 --> 00:04:53.060 
recently tested out this is basically a
nail<00:04:51.390> polish<00:04:51.660> but<00:04:52.260> it's<00:04:52.380> supposed<00:04:52.680> to<00:04:52.770> look

00:04:53.060 --> 00:04:53.070 
nail polish but it's supposed to look

00:04:53.070 --> 00:04:55.130 
nail polish but it's supposed to look
like<00:04:53.130> a<00:04:53.340> gel<00:04:53.670> and<00:04:53.880> lasts<00:04:54.060> as<00:04:54.270> long<00:04:54.300> as<00:04:54.600> a<00:04:54.630> gel<00:04:54.900> I

found that this lasts long as compared
to<00:04:58.200> a<00:04:58.320> regular<00:04:58.470> nail<00:04:58.830> polish<00:04:59.250> but<00:04:59.700> not<00:04:59.940> as<00:05:00.090> long

00:05:00.260 --> 00:05:00.270 
to a regular nail polish but not as long

00:05:09.450 --> 00:05:11.990

coat<00:05:09.780> and<00:05:10.050> they<00:05:10.800> have<00:05:11.100> it<00:05:11.250> go<00:05:11.370> on<00:05:11.520> very<00:05:11.700> very

00:05:11.990 --> 00:05:12.000 
coat and they have it go on very very

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:13.850 
coat and they have it go on very very
thick<00:05:12.270> so<00:05:12.510> it<00:05:12.660> does<00:05:12.870> look<00:05:13.080> like<00:05:13.230> a<00:05:13.290> gel<00:05:13.620> and<00:05:13.650> it

00:05:13.850 --> 00:05:13.860 
thick so it does look like a gel and it

00:05:13.860 --> 00:05:15.950 
thick so it does look like a gel and it
does<00:05:14.010> have<00:05:14.190> ultra-high<00:05:14.670> shine<00:05:15.030> without<00:05:15.360> a

00:05:15.950 --> 00:05:15.960 
does have ultra-high shine without a

00:05:15.960 --> 00:05:17.840 
does have ultra-high shine without a
topcoat<00:05:16.380> now<00:05:16.830> I<00:05:17.040> would<00:05:17.490> still<00:05:17.700> recommend

00:05:17.840 --> 00:05:17.850 
topcoat now I would still recommend

00:05:17.850 --> 00:05:19.490 
topcoat now I would still recommend
putting<00:05:18.270> a<00:05:18.420> top<00:05:18.600> coat<00:05:18.780> on<00:05:18.900> this<00:05:19.080> because<00:05:19.290> it

00:05:19.490 --> 00:05:19.500 
putting a top coat on this because it

00:05:19.500 --> 00:05:20.870 
putting a top coat on this because it
just<00:05:19.530> prevents<00:05:20.040> it<00:05:20.130> from<00:05:20.190> getting<00:05:20.370> dinged<00:05:20.670> and

00:05:20.870 --> 00:05:20.880 
just prevents it from getting dinged and

00:05:20.880 --> 00:05:22.730 
just prevents it from getting dinged and
scratched<00:05:21.210> even<00:05:21.900> though<00:05:21.990> it's<00:05:22.200> super<00:05:22.590> super

00:05:22.730 --> 00:05:22.740 
scratched even though it's super super

00:05:22.740 --> 00:05:25.550 
scratched even though it's super super
shiny<00:05:23.220> and<00:05:23.520> super<00:05:23.790> shellac<00:05:24.180> E<00:05:24.210> if<00:05:24.630> you<00:05:25.140> do<00:05:25.290> ding

00:05:25.550 --> 00:05:25.560 
shiny and super shellac E if you do ding

00:05:25.560 --> 00:05:27.080 
shiny and super shellac E if you do ding
it<00:05:25.710> it<00:05:25.830> still<00:05:26.040> gets<00:05:26.190> a<00:05:26.220> little<00:05:26.310> bit<00:05:26.490> duller<00:05:26.760> so

00:05:27.080 --> 00:05:27.090 
it it still gets a little bit duller so

00:05:27.090 --> 00:05:28.700 
it it still gets a little bit duller so
this<00:05:27.570> is<00:05:27.720> definitely<00:05:27.870> an<00:05:28.170> option<00:05:28.350> if<00:05:28.590> you<00:05:28.680> like

00:05:28.700 --> 00:05:28.710 
this is definitely an option if you like

this is definitely an option if you like
