00:01:10.810 --> 00:01:10.820 
coach because I had somebody request

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:16.960 
coach because I had somebody request
that<00:01:11.060> so<00:01:11.329> let's<00:01:11.509> do<00:01:11.659> coach<00:01:12.670> and<00:01:15.310> the<00:01:16.310> font<00:01:16.670> that

00:01:16.960 --> 00:01:16.970 
that so let's do coach and the font that

00:01:16.970 --> 00:01:20.100 
that so let's do coach and the font that
we're<00:01:17.119> going<00:01:17.299> to<00:01:17.509> use<00:01:17.780> is<00:01:18.049> our<00:01:18.320> brush<00:01:18.829> script

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:20.110 
we're going to use is our brush script

00:01:20.110 --> 00:01:25.359 
we're going to use is our brush script
font<00:01:22.149> and<00:01:23.149> let's<00:01:23.450> not<00:01:24.049> do<00:01:24.259> all<00:01:24.469> caps<00:01:24.799> though<00:01:25.130> I

00:01:25.359 --> 00:01:25.369 
font and let's not do all caps though I

00:01:25.369 --> 00:01:27.340 
font and let's not do all caps though I
think<00:01:25.850> it<00:01:26.090> looks<00:01:26.270> better<00:01:26.479> if<00:01:26.600> we<00:01:26.810> don't<00:01:26.990> do<00:01:27.170> all

00:01:27.340 --> 00:01:27.350 
think it looks better if we don't do all

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:30.370 
think it looks better if we don't do all
caps<00:01:28.240> now<00:01:29.240> I'm<00:01:29.299> going<00:01:29.450> to<00:01:29.509> change<00:01:29.810> the<00:01:30.079> color

00:01:30.370 --> 00:01:30.380 
caps now I'm going to change the color

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:33.310 
caps now I'm going to change the color
of<00:01:30.619> this<00:01:31.390> just<00:01:32.390> so<00:01:32.509> we<00:01:32.630> could<00:01:32.750> see<00:01:32.960> it<00:01:33.079> a<00:01:33.170> little

00:01:33.310 --> 00:01:33.320 
of this just so we could see it a little

00:01:33.320 --> 00:01:35.230 
of this just so we could see it a little
bit<00:01:33.530> better<00:01:33.710> I<00:01:34.009> do<00:01:34.610> want<00:01:34.909> to<00:01:34.969> go<00:01:35.090> into

00:01:35.230 --> 00:01:35.240 
bit better I do want to go into

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:36.639 
bit better I do want to go into
wireframe<00:01:35.810> mode<00:01:35.990> here<00:01:36.200> because<00:01:36.380> I<00:01:36.409> want<00:01:36.590> to

00:01:36.639 --> 00:01:36.649 
wireframe mode here because I want to

00:01:36.649 --> 00:01:38.499 
wireframe mode here because I want to
show<00:01:36.829> you<00:01:36.890> something<00:01:37.399> when<00:01:38.000> you're<00:01:38.119> using<00:01:38.329> a

00:01:38.499 --> 00:01:38.509 
show you something when you're using a

00:01:38.509 --> 00:01:40.929 
show you something when you're using a
script<00:01:38.780> font<00:01:39.110> similar<00:01:39.560> to<00:01:39.740> this<00:01:39.920> you<00:01:40.520> see<00:01:40.789> how

00:01:40.929 --> 00:01:40.939 
script font similar to this you see how

00:01:40.939 --> 00:01:44.380 
script font similar to this you see how
these<00:01:41.119> letters<00:01:41.570> this<00:01:41.960> overlap<00:01:43.000> so<00:01:44.000> we<00:01:44.180> need<00:01:44.329> to

00:01:44.380 --> 00:01:44.390 
these letters this overlap so we need to

00:01:44.390 --> 00:01:46.929 
these letters this overlap so we need to
get<00:01:44.539> rid<00:01:44.750> of<00:01:44.780> that<00:01:45.399> so<00:01:46.399> what<00:01:46.549> we're<00:01:46.640> gonna<00:01:46.700> do

00:01:46.929 --> 00:01:46.939 
get rid of that so what we're gonna do

00:01:46.939 --> 00:01:48.760 
get rid of that so what we're gonna do
is<00:01:47.060> select<00:01:47.270> that<00:01:47.689> go<00:01:48.079> to<00:01:48.140> the<00:01:48.320> arrange<00:01:48.560> menu

we're gonna do first is we're going to

00:04:00.920 --> 00:04:03.880 
we're gonna do first is we're going to
apply<00:04:01.459> a<00:04:01.790> contour<00:04:02.330> to<00:04:02.600> baseball<00:04:03.050> so<00:04:03.620> go<00:04:03.830> to

00:04:03.880 --> 00:04:03.890 
apply a contour to baseball so go to

00:04:03.890 --> 00:04:05.620 
apply a contour to baseball so go to
contour<00:04:04.430> click<00:04:04.670> a<00:04:04.700> drag

00:04:05.620 --> 00:04:05.630 
contour click a drag

00:04:05.630 --> 00:04:08.949 
contour click a drag
create<00:04:06.560> a<00:04:06.590> contour<00:04:06.950> then<00:04:07.790> we<00:04:08.180> want<00:04:08.360> to<00:04:08.450> do<00:04:08.870> the

00:04:08.949 --> 00:04:08.959 
create a contour then we want to do the

00:04:08.959 --> 00:04:11.550 
create a contour then we want to do the
same<00:04:09.110> thing<00:04:09.290> with<00:04:09.410> our<00:04:09.530> coach<00:04:09.739> click<00:04:10.489> and<00:04:10.670> drag

00:04:11.550 --> 00:04:11.560 
same thing with our coach click and drag

00:04:11.560 --> 00:04:16.330 
same thing with our coach click and drag
create<00:04:12.560> a<00:04:12.620> contour<00:04:13.070> of<00:04:13.220> our<00:04:13.310> coach<00:04:15.070> like<00:04:16.070> such

00:04:16.330 --> 00:04:16.340 
create a contour of our coach like such

00:04:16.340 --> 00:04:20.050 
create a contour of our coach like such
okay<00:04:18.190> so<00:04:19.190> then<00:04:19.340> what<00:04:19.489> we're<00:04:19.580> gonna<00:04:19.700> do<00:04:19.940> is

00:04:21.550 --> 00:04:21.560 
we're gonna right click on our contour

00:04:21.560 --> 00:04:23.200 
we're gonna right click on our contour
and<00:04:21.799> break<00:04:21.950> it<00:04:22.070> apart<00:04:22.160> and<00:04:22.640> right<00:04:22.910> click<00:04:23.090> on

00:04:23.200 --> 00:04:23.210

00:04:23.210 --> 00:04:26.560 
and break it apart and right click on
this<00:04:23.360> contour<00:04:23.780> and<00:04:24.110> break<00:04:24.260> it<00:04:24.380> apart<00:04:24.729> now<00:04:25.729> what

00:04:26.560 --> 00:04:26.570 
this contour and break it apart now what

00:04:26.570 --> 00:04:29.879 
this contour and break it apart now what
I<00:04:26.600> need<00:04:26.750> to<00:04:26.960> do<00:04:27.200> is<00:04:27.350> I<00:04:27.440> need<00:04:27.500> to<00:04:27.740> trim<00:04:28.100> away

00:04:29.879 --> 00:04:29.889 
I need to do is I need to trim away

00:04:29.889 --> 00:04:32.219 
I need to do is I need to trim away
where<00:04:30.520> this<00:04:30.789> contour<00:04:31.330> is<00:04:31.539> sitting<00:04:31.870> on<00:04:31.990> top<00:04:32.020> of

00:04:32.219 --> 00:04:32.229 
where this contour is sitting on top of

00:04:32.229 --> 00:04:34.230 
where this contour is sitting on top of
baseball<00:04:32.800> I<00:04:33.009> need<00:04:33.370> to<00:04:33.460> trim<00:04:33.759> away<00:04:34.060> that

00:04:34.230 --> 00:04:34.240 
baseball I need to trim away that

00:04:34.240 --> 00:04:38.459 
baseball I need to trim away that
underlying<00:04:34.749> text<00:04:35.249> so<00:04:36.249> select<00:04:36.669> both<00:04:37.319> trim<00:04:38.319> away

00:04:42.330 --> 00:04:42.340 
and now you can see baseball's been

00:04:42.340 --> 00:04:46.290 
and now you can see baseball's been
trimmed<00:04:42.639> then<00:04:43.629> I'm<00:04:44.620> gonna<00:04:44.770> take<00:04:45.069> both<00:04:45.699> of<00:04:45.969> the

trimmed then I'm gonna take both of the
red<00:04:46.479> pieces<00:04:46.960> and<00:04:47.229> weld<00:04:48.219> them<00:04:48.430> together<00:04:49.199> then

00:04:50.189 --> 00:04:50.199 
red pieces and weld them together then

00:04:50.199 --> 00:04:51.899 
red pieces and weld them together then
I'm<00:04:50.529> gonna<00:04:50.650> get<00:04:50.860> rid<00:04:51.039> of<00:04:51.069> all<00:04:51.370> the<00:04:51.550> little<00:04:51.789> bits

00:04:51.899 --> 00:04:51.909 
I'm gonna get rid of all the little bits

00:04:51.909 --> 00:04:54.480 
I'm gonna get rid of all the little bits
and<00:04:52.120> pieces<00:04:52.180> here<00:04:52.689> so<00:04:53.110> all<00:04:53.289> of<00:04:53.439> these<00:04:53.560> I've

00:04:54.480 --> 00:04:54.490

this and maybe even this and this okay

00:05:04.289 --> 00:05:08.959 
this and maybe even this and this okay
so<00:05:05.289> now<00:05:05.529> what<00:05:06.370> you're<00:05:06.580> looking<00:05:06.610> at<00:05:06.969> is<00:05:07.289> this

00:05:08.959 --> 00:05:08.969 
so now what you're looking at is this

00:05:08.969 --> 00:05:12.350 
so now what you're looking at is this
one<00:05:09.969> basically<00:05:10.900> solid<00:05:11.259> piece<00:05:11.529> of<00:05:11.560> red<00:05:11.949> and

00:05:12.350 --> 00:05:12.360 
one basically solid piece of red and

00:05:12.360 --> 00:05:16.290 
one basically solid piece of red and
then<00:05:13.360> you<00:05:13.539> have<00:05:13.689> your<00:05:13.870> two<00:05:14.139> text<00:05:14.680> on<00:05:14.889> top<00:05:15.189> so<00:05:16.029> if

00:05:16.290 --> 00:05:16.300 
then you have your two text on top so if

00:05:16.300 --> 00:05:19.379 
then you have your two text on top so if
you<00:05:16.509> have<00:05:16.750> somebody<00:05:17.080> who<00:05:18.029> just<00:05:19.029> a<00:05:19.090> little<00:05:19.300> bit

00:05:19.379 --> 00:05:19.389 
you have somebody who just a little bit

00:05:19.389 --> 00:05:21.420 
you have somebody who just a little bit
more<00:05:19.569> budget<00:05:19.990> minded<00:05:20.169> you<00:05:20.710> could<00:05:20.889> just<00:05:21.129> use

00:05:21.420 --> 00:05:21.430 
more budget minded you could just use

00:05:21.430 --> 00:05:25.050 
more budget minded you could just use
these<00:05:21.879> two<00:05:22.120> pieces<00:05:22.800> but<00:05:23.800> if<00:05:24.189> you<00:05:24.460> have

00:05:25.050 --> 00:05:25.060 
these two pieces but if you have

00:05:25.060 --> 00:05:28.200 
these two pieces but if you have
somebody<00:05:25.509> who<00:05:25.839> wants<00:05:26.139> that<00:05:26.560> extra<00:05:27.009> color<00:05:27.430> you

00:05:28.200 --> 00:05:28.210 
somebody who wants that extra color you

00:05:28.210 --> 00:05:31.260 
somebody who wants that extra color you
have<00:05:28.389> that<00:05:28.569> option<00:05:28.749> too<00:05:29.400> so<00:05:30.400> but<00:05:30.819> now<00:05:31.029> we're

00:05:31.260 --> 00:05:31.270 
have that option too so but now we're

00:05:31.270 --> 00:05:33.209 
have that option too so but now we're
going<00:05:31.389> to<00:05:31.449> set<00:05:31.659> up<00:05:31.749> the<00:05:31.839> trap<00:05:31.990> and<00:05:32.349> the<00:05:32.710> trap<00:05:33.009> is

00:05:33.209 --> 00:05:33.219 
going to set up the trap and the trap is

00:05:33.219 --> 00:05:35.640 
going to set up the trap and the trap is
real<00:05:33.400> simple<00:05:33.729> you<00:05:34.419> have<00:05:34.599> two<00:05:34.900> separate<00:05:35.469> pieces

00:05:35.640 --> 00:05:35.650 
real simple you have two separate pieces

00:05:35.650 --> 00:05:38.519 
real simple you have two separate pieces
of<00:05:35.889> text<00:05:36.250> here<00:05:36.339> these<00:05:36.639> are<00:05:36.849> not<00:05:37.029> together<00:05:37.529> so

00:05:38.519 --> 00:05:38.529 
of text here these are not together so

00:05:38.529 --> 00:05:40.890 
of text here these are not together so
we're<00:05:38.710> going<00:05:38.800> to<00:05:38.889> add<00:05:39.009> a<00:05:39.039> contour<00:05:39.900> one

00:05:40.890 --> 00:05:40.900 
we're going to add a contour one

00:05:40.900 --> 00:05:46.309 
we're going to add a contour one
millimeter<00:05:41.439> 1<00:05:41.830> mm<00:05:42.460> to<00:05:43.270> the<00:05:43.300> inside<00:05:43.810> and<00:05:44.460> then<00:05:45.460> a

00:05:46.309 --> 00:05:46.319 
millimeter 1 mm to the inside and then a

00:05:46.319 --> 00:05:50.459 
millimeter 1 mm to the inside and then a
contour<00:05:47.319> to<00:05:48.009> the<00:05:48.129> inside<00:05:48.580> so<00:05:49.300> both<00:05:49.569> coach<00:05:49.960> has

00:05:50.459 --> 00:05:50.469 
contour to the inside so both coach has

00:05:50.469 --> 00:05:53.339 
contour to the inside so both coach has
been<00:05:50.740> offset<00:05:50.949> by<00:05:51.279> 1<00:05:51.610> millimeter<00:05:51.819> and<00:05:52.360> baseball

00:05:53.339 --> 00:05:53.349 
been offset by 1 millimeter and baseball

00:05:53.349 --> 00:05:55.980 
been offset by 1 millimeter and baseball
has<00:05:53.620> been<00:05:53.830> offset<00:05:54.039> by<00:05:54.310> 1<00:05:54.669> millimeter<00:05:54.879> so<00:05:55.810> then

00:05:55.980 --> 00:05:55.990 
has been offset by 1 millimeter so then

00:05:55.990 --> 00:05:58.529 
has been offset by 1 millimeter so then
we<00:05:56.110> right<00:05:56.289> click<00:05:56.490> break<00:05:57.490> condor<00:05:57.879> groove<00:05:58.120> apart

00:05:58.529 --> 00:05:58.539 
we right click break condor groove apart

00:05:58.539 --> 00:06:01.920 
we right click break condor groove apart
select<00:05:59.349> the<00:05:59.469> inside<00:05:59.919> contour<00:06:00.550> and<00:06:00.909> the<00:06:01.689> red

contour<00:06:19.080> visually<00:06:20.080> nothing<00:06:20.919> changes<00:06:21.370> but<00:06:21.669> now

00:06:22.649 --> 00:06:22.659 
contour visually nothing changes but now

00:06:22.659 --> 00:06:25.589 
contour visually nothing changes but now
when<00:06:22.960> you<00:06:23.050> move<00:06:23.199> your<00:06:23.379> red<00:06:23.589> outside<00:06:24.389> you<00:06:25.389> see

00:06:25.589 --> 00:06:25.599 
when you move your red outside you see

00:06:25.599 --> 00:06:28.439 
when you move your red outside you see
it<00:06:25.750> has<00:06:25.899> a<00:06:25.930> hole<00:06:26.319> punched<00:06:26.770> into<00:06:26.979> it<00:06:27.219> and<00:06:27.819> that's

00:06:28.439 --> 00:06:28.449 
it has a hole punched into it and that's

00:06:28.449 --> 00:06:30.809 
it has a hole punched into it and that's
what<00:06:28.659> we<00:06:28.750> need<00:06:28.930> so<00:06:29.800> when<00:06:30.039> you<00:06:30.159> if<00:06:30.370> we<00:06:30.520> double

00:06:30.809 --> 00:06:30.819 
what we need so when you if we double

00:06:30.819 --> 00:06:33.240 
what we need so when you if we double
click<00:06:30.849> on<00:06:31.120> this<00:06:31.300> you<00:06:31.960> see<00:06:32.169> that<00:06:32.349> little<00:06:32.680> bit<00:06:33.129> of

00:06:33.240 --> 00:06:33.250 
click on this you see that little bit of

00:06:33.250 --> 00:06:35.850 
click on this you see that little bit of
overlap<00:06:33.520> a<00:06:34.029> little<00:06:34.930> bit<00:06:35.110> of<00:06:35.259> trapping<00:06:35.680> there

00:06:35.850 --> 00:06:35.860 
overlap a little bit of trapping there

00:06:35.860 --> 00:06:38.790 
overlap a little bit of trapping there
all<00:06:36.219> the<00:06:36.580> way<00:06:36.639> around<00:06:36.909> even<00:06:37.300> on<00:06:37.509> you<00:06:38.440> see<00:06:38.680> where

00:06:38.790 --> 00:06:38.800 
all the way around even on you see where

00:06:38.800 --> 00:06:41.369 
all the way around even on you see where
the<00:06:38.919> coach<00:06:39.159> is<00:06:39.370> gonna<00:06:39.580> hide<00:06:40.419> that<00:06:40.750> when<00:06:41.050> we<00:06:41.139> put

00:06:41.369 --> 00:06:41.379 
the coach is gonna hide that when we put

00:06:41.379 --> 00:06:42.860 
the coach is gonna hide that when we put
those<00:06:41.589> colors<00:06:42.099> on<00:06:42.279> top

00:06:42.860 --> 00:06:42.870 
those colors on top

00:06:42.870 --> 00:06:45.530 
those colors on top
okay<00:06:43.650> so<00:06:43.710> baseball<00:06:44.460> and<00:06:44.669> coach<00:06:44.880> could<00:06:45.180> be<00:06:45.300> one

00:06:45.530 --> 00:06:45.540 
okay so baseball and coach could be one

00:06:45.540 --> 00:06:47.540 
okay so baseball and coach could be one
color<00:06:45.810> could<00:06:46.199> be<00:06:46.230> two<00:06:46.560> colors<00:06:46.980> whatever<00:06:47.400> the

00:06:47.540 --> 00:06:47.550 
color could be two colors whatever the

00:06:47.550 --> 00:06:49.820 
color could be two colors whatever the
case<00:06:47.730> might<00:06:47.940> be<00:06:48.000> so<00:06:48.930> let's<00:06:49.110> go<00:06:49.290> ahead<00:06:49.380> and<00:06:49.470> drag

00:06:49.820 --> 00:06:49.830 
case might be so let's go ahead and drag

00:06:49.830 --> 00:06:52.670 
case might be so let's go ahead and drag
over<00:06:50.010> your<00:06:50.280> easy<00:06:50.520> stone<00:06:50.910> arrow<00:06:51.350> slap<00:06:52.350> a<00:06:52.380> weed

00:06:52.670 --> 00:06:52.680 
over your easy stone arrow slap a weed

00:06:52.680 --> 00:06:58.330 
over your easy stone arrow slap a weed
box<00:06:52.949> around<00:06:53.340> it<00:06:53.610> let's<00:06:54.600> go<00:06:54.810> ahead<00:06:55.190> and<00:06:56.300> throw<00:06:57.300> a

00:06:58.330 --> 00:06:58.340 
box around it let's go ahead and throw a

00:06:58.340 --> 00:07:01.760 
box around it let's go ahead and throw a
some<00:06:59.340> glitter<00:07:00.000> on<00:07:00.120> there<00:07:00.570> and<00:07:01.199> I<00:07:01.440> don't<00:07:01.650> know

00:07:01.760 --> 00:07:01.770 
some glitter on there and I don't know

00:07:01.770 --> 00:07:04.730 
some glitter on there and I don't know
we<00:07:01.919> could<00:07:02.040> maybe<00:07:02.310> do<00:07:02.610> this<00:07:02.820> in<00:07:03.030> black<00:07:03.500> if<00:07:04.500> we

00:07:04.730 --> 00:07:04.740 
we could maybe do this in black if we

00:07:04.740 --> 00:07:07.939 
we could maybe do this in black if we
wanted<00:07:05.100> to<00:07:05.160> or<00:07:05.639> maybe<00:07:06.300> we'll<00:07:06.960> do<00:07:07.110> it<00:07:07.139> in<00:07:07.500> silver

00:07:07.939 --> 00:07:07.949 
wanted to or maybe we'll do it in silver

00:07:07.949 --> 00:07:09.650 
wanted to or maybe we'll do it in silver
glitter<00:07:08.250> now<00:07:08.520> we<00:07:08.699> can't<00:07:09.000> do<00:07:09.120> it<00:07:09.240> in<00:07:09.300> silver

00:07:09.650 --> 00:07:09.660 
glitter now we can't do it in silver

00:07:09.660 --> 00:07:13.070 
glitter now we can't do it in silver
glitter<00:07:10.430> we<00:07:11.430> could<00:07:11.610> do<00:07:11.699> it<00:07:11.820> that<00:07:12.570> way<00:07:12.780> let<00:07:13.050> me

00:07:13.070 --> 00:07:13.080 
glitter we could do it that way let me

00:07:13.080 --> 00:07:14.480 
glitter we could do it that way let me
do<00:07:13.290> it<00:07:13.410> in<00:07:13.470> black<00:07:13.650> glitter<00:07:13.860> whatever<00:07:14.250> you<00:07:14.340> want

00:07:14.480 --> 00:07:14.490 
do it in black glitter whatever you want

00:07:14.490 --> 00:07:15.740 
do it in black glitter whatever you want
to<00:07:14.550> do<00:07:14.669> doesn't<00:07:14.880> really<00:07:15.060> matter<00:07:15.300> but<00:07:15.540> you<00:07:15.630> get

00:07:15.740 --> 00:07:15.750 
to do doesn't really matter but you get

00:07:15.750 --> 00:07:19.370 
to do doesn't really matter but you get
the<00:07:15.870> idea<00:07:16.550> of<00:07:17.550> how<00:07:17.760> how<00:07:18.210> this<00:07:18.479> would<00:07:18.690> look<00:07:18.930> and

00:07:19.370 --> 00:07:19.380 
the idea of how how this would look and

00:07:19.380 --> 00:07:21.469 
the idea of how how this would look and
you<00:07:19.500> can<00:07:19.650> see<00:07:19.830> how<00:07:20.010> really<00:07:20.310> easy<00:07:20.729> that<00:07:21.000> method

00:07:21.469 --> 00:07:21.479 
you can see how really easy that method

00:07:21.479 --> 00:07:23.960 
you can see how really easy that method
is<00:07:21.660> that<00:07:22.530> trapping<00:07:22.830> method<00:07:23.130> now<00:07:23.490> I<00:07:23.700> like<00:07:23.940> to

00:07:23.960 --> 00:07:23.970 
is that trapping method now I like to

00:07:23.970 --> 00:07:26.390 
is that trapping method now I like to
use<00:07:24.210> a<00:07:24.240> millimeter<00:07:24.840> because<00:07:25.560> it<00:07:25.889> gives<00:07:26.160> me<00:07:26.280> a

00:07:26.390 --> 00:07:26.400 
use a millimeter because it gives me a

00:07:26.400 --> 00:07:28.040 
use a millimeter because it gives me a
little<00:07:26.669> bit<00:07:26.790> more<00:07:27.150> play<00:07:27.479> when<00:07:27.750> you're<00:07:27.870> going

00:07:28.040 --> 00:07:28.050 
little bit more play when you're going

00:07:28.050 --> 00:07:30.379 
little bit more play when you're going
to<00:07:28.169> lay<00:07:28.410> down<00:07:28.620> your<00:07:28.830> various<00:07:29.220> colors<00:07:29.580> some

00:07:30.379 --> 00:07:30.389 
to lay down your various colors some

00:07:30.389 --> 00:07:32.180 
to lay down your various colors some
people<00:07:30.780> I<00:07:30.990> know<00:07:31.050> use<00:07:31.380> a<00:07:31.410> half<00:07:31.800> a<00:07:31.979> millimeter

00:07:32.180 --> 00:07:32.190 
people I know use a half a millimeter

00:07:32.190 --> 00:07:35.330 
people I know use a half a millimeter
some<00:07:32.970> use<00:07:33.180> a<00:07:33.210> 3/4<00:07:33.930> of<00:07:33.960> a<00:07:34.139> millimeter<00:07:34.560> whatever

00:07:35.330 --> 00:07:35.340 
some use a 3/4 of a millimeter whatever

00:07:35.340 --> 00:07:36.920 
some use a 3/4 of a millimeter whatever
you<00:07:35.490> want<00:07:35.669> to<00:07:35.760> use<00:07:35.910> play<00:07:36.270> with<00:07:36.450> that<00:07:36.600> trapping

00:07:36.920 --> 00:07:36.930 
you want to use play with that trapping

00:07:36.930 --> 00:07:38.750 
you want to use play with that trapping
and<00:07:37.229> figure<00:07:37.530> out<00:07:37.560> what<00:07:38.070> amount<00:07:38.430> of<00:07:38.520> traffic

00:07:38.750 --> 00:07:38.760 
and figure out what amount of traffic

00:07:38.760 --> 00:07:41.629 
and figure out what amount of traffic
you<00:07:39.060> think<00:07:39.330> works<00:07:39.539> best<00:07:39.840> for<00:07:39.960> you<00:07:40.639> I'd

00:07:41.629 --> 00:07:41.639 
you think works best for you I'd

00:07:41.639 --> 00:07:43.640 
you think works best for you I'd
recommend<00:07:42.120> a<00:07:42.210> millimeter<00:07:42.630> but<00:07:42.720> if<00:07:43.139> you<00:07:43.320> want

00:07:43.640 --> 00:07:43.650 
recommend a millimeter but if you want

00:07:43.650 --> 00:07:45.770 
recommend a millimeter but if you want
to<00:07:43.710> use<00:07:43.830> something<00:07:44.100> different<00:07:44.190> you<00:07:44.610> can<00:07:44.910> but

00:07:45.770 --> 00:07:45.780 
to use something different you can but

00:07:45.780 --> 00:07:48.230 
to use something different you can but
it's<00:07:45.990> really<00:07:46.350> that<00:07:46.710> simple<00:07:47.220> to<00:07:47.460> set<00:07:48.000> up<00:07:48.120> that

00:07:48.230 --> 00:07:48.240 
it's really that simple to set up that

00:07:48.240 --> 00:07:50.810 
it's really that simple to set up that
trapping<00:07:48.780> so<00:07:49.320> really<00:07:49.800> nothing<00:07:49.950> that<00:07:50.280> magical

00:07:50.810 --> 00:07:50.820 
trapping so really nothing that magical

00:07:50.820 --> 00:07:52.180 
trapping so really nothing that magical
or<00:07:50.910> special<00:07:51.330> about<00:07:51.570> it

00:07:52.180 --> 00:07:52.190 
or special about it

00:07:52.190 --> 00:07:55.490 
or special about it
so<00:07:53.190> hopefully<00:07:53.460> that<00:07:54.389> will<00:07:54.600> clarify<00:07:54.900> how<00:07:55.440> to

00:07:55.490 --> 00:07:55.500 
so hopefully that will clarify how to

00:07:55.500 --> 00:07:59.120 
so hopefully that will clarify how to
properly<00:07:56.190> set<00:07:56.880> up<00:07:56.910> those<00:07:57.180> trappings<00:07:58.130> when

00:07:59.120 --> 00:07:59.130 
properly set up those trappings when

00:07:59.130 --> 00:08:01.100 
properly set up those trappings when
you're<00:07:59.250> doing<00:07:59.520> these<00:07:59.639> types<00:07:59.970> of<00:08:00.180> to<00:08:00.870> color

00:08:01.100 --> 00:08:01.110 
you're doing these types of to color

00:08:01.110 --> 00:08:03.530 
you're doing these types of to color
designs
