00:00:01.340 --> 00:00:11.200
 Yes is Sedanmon Gil of Ulama in Hello everybody yeah yeah 

00:00:06.910 --> 00:00:15.850
 Today I bought a little Brook Drummaster so today 

00:00:11.200 --> 00:00:18.189
 It's been a week since I bought it, but I can't use it yet, so I 'll give it a little review 

00:00:15.850 --> 00:00:22.960
 I will try to take a video thinking 

00:00:18.189 --> 00:00:27.960
 First of all it's basic but I want to have a table now 

00:00:22.960 --> 00:00:27.960
 That's want gluconate you go like this Fu in rubber and 

00:00:28.750 --> 00:00:34.940
 So this is Brook Grip 

00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:39.469
 5 loop grip comes in Brook grip 

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:42.100
 It is a kick that I use, but yes Yamaha's fp 

00:00:39.469 --> 00:00:44.700
 8500 b 

00:00:42.100 --> 00:00:47.520
 Two are nylon nylon straps 

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:51.520
 Is a nylon strap though 

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:54.530
 It is model without underplate of 

00:00:51.520 --> 00:00:58.910
 It is so serving sake Echigo blanking look-child 

00:00:54.530 --> 00:01:02.640
 It was a switch because I was telling children 

00:00:58.910 --> 00:01:07.860
 I thought it would be easy to step on long boards other than this 

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:08.729
 The old mulder of fp is a little different, but I was troubled with various footwork 

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:13.770
 To 

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:15.990
 I tried to buy it though it was Brooke, but this is good because it is surprisingly good 

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:19.460
 Let me deaf and who say heavy 

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:19.460
 I will do a little under the camera 

00:01:22.930 --> 00:01:27.850
 Follow 

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:30.120
 8 First of all 

00:01:27.850 --> 00:01:32.630
 book 

00:01:30.120 --> 00:01:35.290
 You see this 

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:35.290
 Kana around in 

00:01:38.380 --> 00:01:43.750
 Hmm 

00:01:39.510 --> 00:01:48.550
 First of all, though it is a group 

00:01:43.750 --> 00:01:51.610
 Here you have a place where you are a second-born Hobo, but if you step here 

00:01:48.550 --> 00:01:54.880
 One side comes out 

00:01:51.610 --> 00:01:59.340
 Though it may be hard to understand if it is pack during broadcast well 

00:01:54.880 --> 00:01:59.340
 You can hear the volume 

00:01:59.450 --> 00:02:05.990
 favorite 

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:05.990
 If you have more to do, Brooke uses this capo quite well 

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:11.350
 A little work 

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:22.570
 Basic way after death 

00:02:11.350 --> 00:02:23.569
 Although I think that there are those who think I look at the so princess this out fairly volume also this kind of 

00:02:22.570 --> 00:02:24.470
 I will 

00:02:23.569 --> 00:02:27.760
 Yes 

00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:27.760
 I always 

00:02:33.569 --> 00:02:39.730
 Although this is basically a kind of this group survived Kaiserslautern 

00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:45.400
 fundamentally 

00:02:39.730 --> 00:02:48.269
 But it does not move at all vita I very strong here as well off before this 

00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:48.269
 When incorporated 

00:02:50.200 --> 00:02:55.920
 Taking step into even before 1 is I or active of 3 minutes you will be yes big sound 

00:02:56.819 --> 00:03:02.569
 Go out to that before because it comes out to say 

00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:02.569
 eh 

00:03:07.660 --> 00:03:14.760
 It's pretty good to burn like this 

00:03:10.810 --> 00:03:14.760
 That that day 

00:03:19.800 --> 00:03:27.940
 Yeah it is hit three of that Buster This is also 

00:03:23.600 --> 00:03:27.940
 I think it's amazingly easy to do 

00:03:29.210 --> 00:03:38.630
 8 this but I'm such that the Hey Brooke main wearing a Saiki you are using 

00:03:35.180 --> 00:03:42.270
 It is this beater ring of the beater 

00:03:38.630 --> 00:03:45.710
 I am pushing this off 

00:03:42.270 --> 00:03:45.710
 Here it is generally 

00:03:45.800 --> 00:03:52.780
 A little bit 

00:03:47.530 --> 00:03:55.750
 The other is a little'm around here in the sound to this basically I basically I'd such around here 

00:03:52.780 --> 00:04:00.340
 But a little to eat this, you have to about this 

00:03:55.750 --> 00:04:03.400
 So the spring tension is set quite high 

00:04:00.340 --> 00:04:06.360
 I understand if I try it 

00:04:03.400 --> 00:04:09.090
 Once back at Toka dipped in both schools 

00:04:06.360 --> 00:04:24.389
 It's about this speed 

00:04:09.090 --> 00:04:27.010
 Fine if Re I hope good Patty Pew di pie This is after all this 

00:04:24.389 --> 00:04:30.700
 And because NiÃ±o arrive anymore 

00:04:27.010 --> 00:04:32.750
 It is said that this kind of tension is necessary to get rid of this cling 

00:04:30.700 --> 00:04:36.500
 I'm honest 

00:04:32.750 --> 00:04:40.540
 I'm armed and Massa I am still like that 

00:04:36.500 --> 00:04:40.540
 Don Dong Dong Dong Dong Dong Dong Dong 

00:04:40.850 --> 00:04:47.750
 This quite such speed yet can not do is so much this early I'm not able to 

00:04:43.760 --> 00:04:48.590
 But when I can practice this and train again, I'm thinking of giving a video book again 

00:04:47.750 --> 00:04:52.740
 Because 

00:04:48.590 --> 00:04:55.729
 Well also please have the Ne's fun So the British drama 

00:04:52.740 --> 00:04:55.729
 Zeno was Mont Gil
