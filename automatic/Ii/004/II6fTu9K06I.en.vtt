made out of frozen banana don't freak

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:57.380 
made out of frozen banana don't freak
out<00:00:54.750> it's<00:00:55.230> how<00:00:55.469> surely<00:00:55.800> insanely<00:00:56.670> good<00:00:56.879> plus

00:00:57.380 --> 00:00:57.390 
out it's how surely insanely good plus

00:00:57.390 --> 00:00:59.389 
out it's how surely insanely good plus
it<00:00:57.539> takes<00:00:57.690> about<00:00:57.899> five<00:00:58.260> minutes<00:00:58.500> to<00:00:58.680> make<00:00:58.890> you

don't need a fancy ice cream machine and
it's<00:01:02.129> much<00:01:02.309> healthier<00:01:02.550> than<00:01:02.940> regular<00:01:03.510> ice

00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:03.750

00:01:10.330 --> 00:01:10.340 
technically only need two ingredients

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:13.580 
technically only need two ingredients
frozen<00:01:11.340> bananas<00:01:11.820> and<00:01:12.090> cacao<00:01:12.600> powder<00:01:12.900> you<00:01:13.470> can

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:17.660 
also use cocoa powder or carob powder
personally<00:01:16.470> I<00:01:16.500> also<00:01:16.799> like<00:01:17.100> to<00:01:17.130> add<00:01:17.340> vanilla

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:17.670 
personally I also like to add vanilla

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:20.570 
personally I also like to add vanilla
cacao<00:01:18.479> nibs<00:01:18.840> and<00:01:19.080> walnuts<00:01:19.770> to<00:01:19.920> my<00:01:20.070> ice<00:01:20.250> cream

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:20.580 
cacao nibs and walnuts to my ice cream

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:22.940 
cacao nibs and walnuts to my ice cream
but<00:01:20.790> they<00:01:21.119> are<00:01:21.180> completely<00:01:21.630> optional<00:01:22.080> I<00:01:22.650> just

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:22.950 
but they are completely optional I just

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:24.200 
but they are completely optional I just
like<00:01:23.130> the<00:01:23.280> crunch<00:01:23.520> that<00:01:23.610> they<00:01:23.790> add<00:01:23.939> to<00:01:23.970> the

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:24.210 
like the crunch that they add to the

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:26.090 
like the crunch that they add to the
texture<00:01:24.600> when<00:01:24.810> freezing<00:01:25.140> the<00:01:25.350> bananas<00:01:25.830> make

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:26.100 
texture when freezing the bananas make

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:27.770 
texture when freezing the bananas make
sure<00:01:26.310> that<00:01:26.580> they're<00:01:26.759> ripe<00:01:27.060> how<00:01:27.390> do<00:01:27.450> you<00:01:27.659> know

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:27.780 
sure that they're ripe how do you know

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:29.539 
sure that they're ripe how do you know
if<00:01:27.990> they<00:01:28.200> are<00:01:28.229> they<00:01:28.710> simply<00:01:29.100> should<00:01:29.340> have<00:01:29.520> a

00:01:29.539 --> 00:01:29.549 
if they are they simply should have a

00:01:29.549 --> 00:01:31.670 
if they are they simply should have a
bunch<00:01:29.939> of<00:01:30.119> brown<00:01:30.420> spots<00:01:30.659> on<00:01:31.079> them<00:01:31.290> this<00:01:31.619> is

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:31.680 
bunch of brown spots on them this is

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:33.770 
bunch of brown spots on them this is
important<00:01:32.280> because<00:01:32.310> ripe<00:01:32.909> bananas<00:01:33.450> are<00:01:33.570> much

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:33.780 
important because ripe bananas are much

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:35.840 
important because ripe bananas are much
sweeter<00:01:34.170> so<00:01:34.560> you<00:01:34.619> will<00:01:34.950> not<00:01:35.070> need<00:01:35.340> to<00:01:35.369> use<00:01:35.700> any

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:35.850 
sweeter so you will not need to use any

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:37.819 
sweeter so you will not need to use any
other<00:01:36.000> sweetener<00:01:36.570> for<00:01:36.810> your<00:01:37.110> ice<00:01:37.259> cream<00:01:37.590> also

00:01:37.819 --> 00:01:37.829 
other sweetener for your ice cream also

00:01:37.829 --> 00:01:39.800 
other sweetener for your ice cream also
ripe<00:01:38.280> bananas<00:01:38.759> are<00:01:38.939> much<00:01:39.090> easier<00:01:39.509> for<00:01:39.750> us

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:39.810 
ripe bananas are much easier for us

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:42.230 
ripe bananas are much easier for us
today<00:01:40.170> just<00:01:40.470> when<00:01:41.220> I'm<00:01:41.340> freezing<00:01:41.729> the<00:01:41.759> bananas

00:01:42.230 --> 00:01:42.240 
today just when I'm freezing the bananas

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:43.969 
today just when I'm freezing the bananas
for<00:01:42.420> ice<00:01:42.540> cream<00:01:42.780> I<00:01:42.899> simply<00:01:43.350> peel<00:01:43.619> them<00:01:43.829> and

00:01:43.969 --> 00:01:43.979 
for ice cream I simply peel them and

00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:46.460 
for ice cream I simply peel them and
