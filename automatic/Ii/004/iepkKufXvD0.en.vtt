00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.490
 hi my name is jeff and i am in charge 

00:00:02.730 --> 00:00:07.290
 developing the topic of lego technician and now 

00:00:05.490 --> 00:00:09.330
 I will tell you about the novelties of the second 

00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:13.139
 half year 2013 

00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:15.059
 which run in august theme 

00:00:13.139 --> 00:00:15.630
 colleague technique is based on three 

00:00:15.059 --> 00:00:18.270
 principles 

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:25.199
 authenticity all models kids can 

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:27.359
 see life functionality in each 

00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:29.189
 models have many of their features 

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:33.239
 and the last principle 

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:33.840
 assembly complexity the assembly process itself goes 

00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:37.410
 on a par 

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:39.540
 or sometimes even more interesting and more important than the game 

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:43.340
 with the model to begin with let's see 

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:47.670
 entry-level models and 

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:49.850
 The first model is the 40 2001 mini 

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:49.850
 SUV 

00:00:52.399 --> 00:00:57.960
 although this is the youngest model of 

00:00:55.289 --> 00:01:00.750
 updated range of techniques but 

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:03.210
 she has a full suspension on all wheels 

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:07.590
 she can go far and still with her 

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:11.760
 doors open and since this model 

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:13.979
 to attract newcomers to the series we 

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:17.939
 want the second model in the set 

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:21.170
 it was easier to build than 1 so we 

00:01:17.939 --> 00:01:24.080
 added the ability to remove this flesh 

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:27.180
 then you can separate the body from the frame and 

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:29.759
 when the body is built then it can 

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:38.070
 easy to connect the frame so the 

00:01:29.759 --> 00:01:41.490
 it turns out easier then we go more 

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:44.070
 older model 40 2005 monster truck 

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:46.560
 which is very cool has a fiery 

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:49.020
 coloring it really like a boy u 

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:52.049
 she also has a full all-wheel drive suspension 

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:54.479
 all wheels turn and this model 

00:01:52.049 --> 00:02:01.770
 very interesting to play with all these 

00:01:54.479 --> 00:02:04.560
 functions now model 40 2008 

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:06.300
 machine maintenance and with higher 

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:08.790
 price category 

00:02:06.300 --> 00:02:10.160
 This model fully meets the concept 

00:02:08.790 --> 00:02:12.900
 lego technic 

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:17.130
 reliability of functionality complexity 

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:19.860
 assembly in this model is present 

00:02:17.130 --> 00:02:21.440
 electric motor and system 

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:23.870
 not in mother 

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:26.820
 so there will be an air compressor 

00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:31.530
 which will really push 

00:02:26.820 --> 00:02:33.900
 air through some cylinders and so 

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:36.420
 some features will work this 

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:41.010
 very important for real fans of the series 

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:43.680
 and children and adults we also use 

00:02:41.010 --> 00:02:47.150
 green color for a model that's pretty 

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:47.150
 unusual for the lego technic series 

00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:56.310
 but I'd rather show you the functions and all that 

00:02:53.850 --> 00:02:58.350
 you can see in this model she has 

00:02:56.310 --> 00:03:02.820
 four wheel drive 

00:02:58.350 --> 00:03:04.560
 and just 8 wheels at the bottom you can turn on 

00:03:02.820 --> 00:03:09.480
 electric motor function 

00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:11.600
 and on the side there are levers to control 

00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:11.600
 functions 

00:03:15.310 --> 00:03:20.950
 In this model there are two functions that 

00:03:17.739 --> 00:03:24.670
 controlled pneumatic systems 1 this 

00:03:20.950 --> 00:03:28.150
 retractable boom and another function 

00:03:24.670 --> 00:03:30.870
 This is the platform behind the machine that is needed. 

00:03:28.150 --> 00:03:34.200
 for transportation of broken cars 

00:03:30.870 --> 00:03:42.480
 except pneumatic function 

00:03:34.200 --> 00:03:42.480
 you can raise and lower the boom with a 

00:03:46.709 --> 00:03:58.000
 also raise and lower remote 

00:03:49.630 --> 00:04:07.450
 support and growth can also be controlled 

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:08.739
 with hook by motor and last 

00:04:07.450 --> 00:04:11.890
 new lego technic 

00:04:08.739 --> 00:04:14.890
 in the second half our main model 

00:04:11.890 --> 00:04:19.500
 This is the largest model in the range. 

00:04:14.890 --> 00:04:24.490
 lego technic this model 40 2009 

00:04:19.500 --> 00:04:27.370
 he has a huge mobile crane 

00:04:24.490 --> 00:04:29.979
 the number of functions and elements is the most 

00:04:27.370 --> 00:04:32.530
 big model that has ever been in 

00:04:29.979 --> 00:04:35.440
 a series of techniques it consists of more than 

00:04:32.530 --> 00:04:37.500
 two and a half thousand items this 

00:04:35.440 --> 00:04:39.160
 real representative of the series 

00:04:37.500 --> 00:04:44.260
 classic designer 

00:04:39.160 --> 00:04:49.110
 now he has 5 axes 

00:04:44.260 --> 00:04:49.110
 turns eight out of ten wheels at 

00:04:49.530 --> 00:04:55.419
 him a long arrow with more modern 

00:04:52.960 --> 00:05:00.039
 elements it can be understood by 

00:04:55.419 --> 00:05:02.139
 rounded element also for this 

00:05:00.039 --> 00:05:08.860
 models we developed new mechanisms 

00:05:02.139 --> 00:05:12.210
 for outriggers now I will show all 

00:05:08.860 --> 00:05:14.229
 features of this model she has 

00:05:12.210 --> 00:05:18.340
 eight-cylinder engine which 

00:05:14.229 --> 00:05:22.240
 Of course it works when driving long 

00:05:18.340 --> 00:05:25.020
 arrow and lots of features for her so 

00:05:22.240 --> 00:05:30.000
 there is a built-in electric move 

00:05:25.020 --> 00:05:32.069
 that control all functions with this 

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:35.009
 side of the model there is a switch 

00:05:32.069 --> 00:05:39.360
 functions where you can choose which one 

00:05:35.009 --> 00:05:40.979
 enjoy one of these is 

00:05:39.360 --> 00:05:43.680
 switch to mode 

00:05:40.979 --> 00:05:48.000
 extension of outriggers which 

00:05:43.680 --> 00:05:54.090
 controlled by the lever here let's 

00:05:48.000 --> 00:06:02.389
 let's see how the functions themselves work 

00:05:54.090 --> 00:06:02.389
 so the arrow rises and falls 

00:06:03.440 --> 00:06:08.430
 then you can push the boom to pretty 

00:06:06.150 --> 00:06:12.710
 long distance nor does it 

00:06:08.430 --> 00:06:12.710
 lost stability in the crane itself 

00:06:21.320 --> 00:06:31.120
 and the next function is the hook itself 

00:06:26.540 --> 00:06:31.120
 push and load it 

00:06:33.490 --> 00:06:39.020
 on can use spice and then you can 

00:06:36.920 --> 00:06:50.540
 switch control to the bottom 

00:06:39.020 --> 00:06:52.340
 crane and use retractable supports well 

00:06:50.540 --> 00:06:54.950
 of course it had to be done before 

00:06:52.340 --> 00:06:57.170
 as we began to push the arrow and decided 

00:06:54.950 --> 00:06:59.810
 something on the signs and thanks to the new 

00:06:57.170 --> 00:07:02.630
 the element that we have developed can 

00:06:59.810 --> 00:07:03.110
 in this way reinforce retractable 

00:07:02.630 --> 00:07:06.260
 supports 

00:07:03.110 --> 00:07:12.740
 this is necessary if you decide to raise 

00:07:06.260 --> 00:07:14.030
 heavier loads and so in this model 

00:07:12.740 --> 00:07:16.160
 so many functions 

00:07:14.030 --> 00:07:17.660
 they are all controlled by electric 

00:07:16.160 --> 00:07:20.270
 motor also has a large number 

00:07:17.660 --> 00:07:22.570
 elements it is very important for the process 

00:07:20.270 --> 00:07:26.120
 collection it was our flagship model 

00:07:22.570 --> 00:07:29.570
 mobile crane and this is all new on 

00:07:26.120 --> 00:07:30.110
 second half of 2013 in lego 

00:07:29.570 --> 00:07:32.360
 technic 

00:07:30.110 --> 00:07:34.660
 I hope you enjoyed it even before new ones 

00:07:32.360 --> 00:07:34.660
 meeting
