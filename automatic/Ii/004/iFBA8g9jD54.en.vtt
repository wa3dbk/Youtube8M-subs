00:00:06.060 --> 00:00:09.350
 Good thing about Esteban 

00:00:09.800 --> 00:00:13.760
 not only super quiet I think the 

00:00:11.870 --> 00:00:18.680
 people here from the club did all the 

00:00:13.760 --> 00:00:20.060
 efforts and fortunately because there are 

00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:22.550
 things that you drive and things that you do not 

00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:25.790
 handles and here the subject of what was his 

00:00:22.550 --> 00:00:29.750
 release arrived so we're with a 

00:00:25.790 --> 00:00:32.930
 full campus all available for 

00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:35.239
 be able to do everything possible to leave 

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:38.980
 the three points here here at home we are going to 

00:00:35.239 --> 00:00:42.379
 see what's best for the team 

00:00:38.980 --> 00:00:46.100
 here more than the names the important thing 

00:00:42.379 --> 00:00:47.809
 they are the team so let's put 

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:50.600
 the team that we want as we do not 

00:00:47.809 --> 00:00:51.980
 deliver us the security of power 

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:55.280
 that not with the three points that are 

00:00:51.980 --> 00:00:57.019
 tremendously necessary if we win 

00:00:55.280 --> 00:00:59.269
 again we stay on top of the 

00:00:57.019 --> 00:01:01.540
 table and our our main 

00:00:59.269 --> 00:01:03.430
 objective as a group 

00:01:01.540 --> 00:01:06.520
 I believe that when one assumes in colo 

00:01:03.430 --> 00:01:08.580
 colo has to do not need to get it 

00:01:06.520 --> 00:01:10.600
 put in the contract or you know that 

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:14.140
 has to be a protagonist in the 

00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:16.240
 tournaments and that you have to go to 

00:01:14.140 --> 00:01:18.130
 try to win and go out champion is more 

00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:19.580
 when when a while ago it was not 

00:01:18.130 --> 00:01:23.800
 win and 

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:27.770
 and the club people are eager to 

00:01:23.800 --> 00:01:29.390
 championship on our side that you know 

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:32.800
 for that we work but mainly 

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:35.390
 also here there is a way and there is a 

00:01:32.800 --> 00:01:37.780
 an identity of the club that also 

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:40.400
 you also have to create and that's not 

00:01:37.780 --> 00:01:44.080
 something that is achieved from the night to the 

00:01:40.400 --> 00:01:44.080
 tomorrow we just today 

00:01:44.380 --> 00:01:50.820
 We are already with the campus almost 100% 

00:01:48.460 --> 00:01:52.860
 definite 

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:54.240
 starting today from this week 

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:57.060
 we have already started working 

00:01:54.240 --> 00:02:00.960
 which is really what we were saying for 

00:01:57.060 --> 00:02:03.140
 this campus the the thing the results 

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:05.640
 Thing are required to leave champion 

00:02:03.140 --> 00:02:07.410
 logically necessary but here is a 

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:10.020
 club behind there is a club that has to 

00:02:07.410 --> 00:02:13.080
 play in a way not only that you 

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:15.690
 is going to be the results your view the subject 

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:18.840
 is finding the solution and the 

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:20.520
 find in him when you are also 

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:22.709
 playing a single championship because here not 

00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:24.930
 we are when neither chili glass yet nor 

00:02:22.709 --> 00:02:28.100
 Copa Sudamericana liberators and we are 

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:30.959
 all stuck in a single championship and 

00:02:28.100 --> 00:02:33.870
 inside of that I do not know the ones that 

00:02:30.959 --> 00:02:37.380
 they play after they are six more 

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:39.090
 they go to the bank and they take a number 

00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:41.010
 important of players with a lot 

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:45.570
 quality with a lot of travel outside 

00:02:41.010 --> 00:02:48.420
 claudio by everyone everywhere is a 

00:02:45.570 --> 00:02:51.239
 excellent player has in the race 

00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:54.350
 a race that any player 

00:02:51.239 --> 00:02:54.350
 who would like to have it 

00:02:54.620 --> 00:03:03.190
 but the club made all the efforts 

00:02:59.920 --> 00:03:06.130
 to be able to bring people who are 

00:03:03.190 --> 00:03:08.920
 I needed also made the efforts 

00:03:06.130 --> 00:03:11.420
 by power on the subject of claudio and here 

00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:14.090
 there is a budget and 

00:03:11.420 --> 00:03:16.849
 and already with the people who are we believe that 

00:03:14.090 --> 00:03:18.200
 the team is fine that is fine 

00:03:16.849 --> 00:03:20.959
 conformed 

00:03:18.200 --> 00:03:23.540
 there are players two or three players per 

00:03:20.959 --> 00:03:25.040
 put then that gives me a come back 

00:03:23.540 --> 00:03:27.230
 to the issue of internal competition gives us 

00:03:25.040 --> 00:03:31.360
 a good competition no doubt that you 

00:03:27.230 --> 00:03:34.380
 Claudio would have arrived and it would have been a 

00:03:31.360 --> 00:03:37.650
 plus everywhere 

00:03:34.380 --> 00:03:40.040
 I have a lot of variety I have in a case 

00:03:37.650 --> 00:03:42.319
 for example 

00:03:40.040 --> 00:03:44.180
 muddy that came to play from central and from 

00:03:42.319 --> 00:03:46.040
 gonzalo fierro containment flywheel 

00:03:44.180 --> 00:03:47.810
 play sideways and play pointer 

00:03:46.040 --> 00:03:51.739
 can play also as mixed by 

00:03:47.810 --> 00:03:55.010
 right of walls can play from 

00:03:51.739 --> 00:03:56.359
 centrodelantero can play from 10 juan 

00:03:55.010 --> 00:04:00.290
 thin can play left pointer 

00:03:56.359 --> 00:04:02.780
 against right the sheet the same thing 

00:04:00.290 --> 00:04:05.269
 olive and the same emilio hernández can 

00:04:02.780 --> 00:04:08.359
 play of mixed 10 of 9 pointer 

00:04:05.269 --> 00:04:12.170
 I have a lot of variety so I am very 

00:04:08.359 --> 00:04:14.629
 happy with the staff I have and I think 

00:04:12.170 --> 00:04:17.030
 that we are doing everything possible 

00:04:14.629 --> 00:04:18.220
 get it the results that the club will 

00:04:17.030 --> 00:04:20.239
 deser 

00:04:18.220 --> 00:04:22.759
 position it where the club is 

00:04:20.239 --> 00:04:24.229
 it deserves also and then the other one that is 

00:04:22.759 --> 00:04:27.349
 more difficult that there is already a job with 

00:04:24.229 --> 00:04:30.199
 more with more time than from the first 

00:04:27.349 --> 00:04:33.080
 category to the campus although there is 

00:04:30.199 --> 00:04:36.470
 an identity and a way that is that 

00:04:33.080 --> 00:04:37.910
 be the one that colo colo works in all 

00:04:36.470 --> 00:04:40.400
 its lines the same from it 

00:04:37.910 --> 00:04:42.169
 way that is the best team that I 

00:04:40.400 --> 00:04:44.690
 I think the results are very close 

00:04:42.169 --> 00:04:47.650
 So far we have 22 victories 

00:04:44.690 --> 00:04:47.650
 so 

00:04:47.870 --> 00:04:53.030
 and I think so, I think my players 

00:04:49.880 --> 00:04:55.139
 they are the best of the best in this 

00:04:53.030 --> 00:04:57.689
 moment of the country 

00:04:55.139 --> 00:05:00.330
 we are in a case lucas domínguez lucas 

00:04:57.689 --> 00:05:03.120
 domingue until what is in the morning 

00:05:00.330 --> 00:05:05.909
 is almost confirmed what was his 

00:05:03.120 --> 00:05:08.069
 loan to everton today I think that 

00:05:05.909 --> 00:05:11.789
 players who go from color to 

00:05:08.069 --> 00:05:15.120
 other clubs are absolutely tremendous 

00:05:11.789 --> 00:05:19.199
 reinforcements so that means that 

00:05:15.120 --> 00:05:20.819
 any of the staff that I have are 

00:05:19.199 --> 00:05:23.189
 the best within their of their 

00:05:20.819 --> 00:05:26.090
 positions and that I'm I'm sure and 

00:05:23.189 --> 00:05:26.090
 for that we prepare for that
