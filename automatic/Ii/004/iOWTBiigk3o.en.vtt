he went and looked at a lot of different
research<00:00:28.609> about<00:00:29.609> why<00:00:29.880> plants<00:00:30.480> get<00:00:30.660> sick<00:00:30.960> and

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:31.170 
research about why plants get sick and

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:33.049 
research about why plants get sick and
why<00:00:31.230> they<00:00:31.380> get<00:00:31.529> attacked<00:00:31.920> by<00:00:32.099> insects<00:00:32.610> and<00:00:32.880> i

00:00:33.049 --> 00:00:33.059 
why they get attacked by insects and i

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:34.310 
why they get attacked by insects and i
want<00:00:33.270> to<00:00:33.329> talk<00:00:33.450> about<00:00:33.600> that<00:00:33.809> here<00:00:33.989> so<00:00:34.140> let's

00:00:34.310 --> 00:00:34.320 
want to talk about that here so let's

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:36.650 
want to talk about that here so let's
say<00:00:34.440> you<00:00:34.500> have<00:00:34.710> a<00:00:34.739> plant<00:00:35.149> i'm<00:00:36.149> not<00:00:36.329> sure<00:00:36.510> how

00:00:36.650 --> 00:00:36.660 
say you have a plant i'm not sure how

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:37.880 
say you have a plant i'm not sure how
well<00:00:36.840> you'll<00:00:36.989> be<00:00:37.079> able<00:00:37.140> to<00:00:37.320> see<00:00:37.469> that<00:00:37.620> green

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:37.890 
well you'll be able to see that green

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:39.950 
well you'll be able to see that green
they're<00:00:38.219> not<00:00:38.430> all<00:00:38.879> that<00:00:39.030> well<00:00:39.180> but<00:00:39.809> that's

00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:39.960

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:42.680 
they're not all that well but that's
okay<00:00:40.230> you<00:00:40.410> have<00:00:40.890> a<00:00:40.920> plant<00:00:41.219> and<00:00:41.610> it's<00:00:42.480> getting

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:42.690 
okay you have a plant and it's getting

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:45.380 
okay you have a plant and it's getting
attacked<00:00:42.989> by<00:00:43.200> insects<00:00:43.920> and<00:00:44.160> i've<00:00:44.910> talked<00:00:45.210> a

00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:45.390 
attacked by insects and i've talked a

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:49.240 
attacked by insects and i've talked a
lot<00:00:45.539> before<00:00:45.719> about<00:00:46.200> how<00:00:46.610> only<00:00:47.610> sick<00:00:48.149> plants

00:00:49.240 --> 00:00:49.250 
lot before about how only sick plants

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:53.420 
lot before about how only sick plants
get<00:00:50.250> attacked<00:00:50.579> by<00:00:51.590> insects<00:00:52.590> a<00:00:52.829> healthy<00:00:53.190> plant

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:53.430 
get attacked by insects a healthy plant

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:55.040 
get attacked by insects a healthy plant
doesn't<00:00:53.670> get<00:00:53.789> attacked<00:00:54.059> because<00:00:54.239> an<00:00:54.600> insect

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:55.050 
doesn't get attacked because an insect

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:56.660 
doesn't get attacked because an insect
it's<00:00:55.289> not<00:00:55.440> food<00:00:55.680> for<00:00:55.710> an<00:00:55.949> insect<00:00:56.190> an<00:00:56.370> insect

00:00:56.660 --> 00:00:56.670 
it's not food for an insect an insect

00:00:56.670 --> 00:00:59.029 
it's not food for an insect an insect
can't<00:00:56.910> digest<00:00:57.090> that<00:00:57.590> but<00:00:58.590> this<00:00:58.739> research

00:00:59.029 --> 00:00:59.039 
can't digest that but this research

00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:01.639 
can't digest that but this research
really<00:00:59.690> got<00:01:00.690> more<00:01:00.899> interesting<00:01:01.440> as<00:01:01.530> to

00:01:01.639 --> 00:01:01.649 
really got more interesting as to

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:03.680 
really got more interesting as to
exactly<00:01:01.800> what's<00:01:02.550> going<00:01:02.789> on<00:01:03.059> in<00:01:03.239> the<00:01:03.329> plant<00:01:03.539> and

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:03.690 
exactly what's going on in the plant and

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:06.320 
exactly what's going on in the plant and
what<00:01:03.870> makes<00:01:04.049> that<00:01:04.199> happened<00:01:04.589> and<00:01:05.309> he<00:01:06.090> found

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:06.330 
what makes that happened and he found

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:11.120 
what makes that happened and he found
out<00:01:06.570> that<00:01:07.310> if<00:01:08.310> a<00:01:08.430> plant<00:01:08.729> has<00:01:08.970> excess<00:01:10.130> soluble

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:11.130 
out that if a plant has excess soluble

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:14.800 
out that if a plant has excess soluble
nitrogen<00:01:11.340> and<00:01:12.030> I<00:01:12.869> think<00:01:13.200> also<00:01:13.470> excess<00:01:14.100> sugars

00:01:14.800 --> 00:01:14.810 
nitrogen and I think also excess sugars

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:19.880 
nitrogen and I think also excess sugars
then<00:01:16.820> what's<00:01:17.820> gonna<00:01:17.909> happen<00:01:18.030> is<00:01:18.740> insects<00:01:19.740> are

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:19.890 
then what's gonna happen is insects are

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:21.760 
then what's gonna happen is insects are
going<00:01:20.009> to<00:01:20.070> want<00:01:20.250> to<00:01:20.310> come<00:01:20.460> and<00:01:20.610> get<00:01:20.729> those

00:01:21.760 --> 00:01:21.770 
going to want to come and get those

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:24.560 
going to want to come and get those
especially<00:01:22.770> nitrogen<00:01:23.640> is<00:01:23.820> my<00:01:23.970> understanding

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:24.570 
especially nitrogen is my understanding

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:27.590 
especially nitrogen is my understanding
so<00:01:25.490> and<00:01:26.490> what<00:01:26.640> happens<00:01:26.939> the<00:01:27.270> reason<00:01:27.509> this

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:27.600 
so and what happens the reason this

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:29.719 
so and what happens the reason this
happens<00:01:27.960> is<00:01:28.080> there<00:01:28.560> can<00:01:28.710> be<00:01:28.740> many<00:01:29.040> reasons<00:01:29.130> but

00:01:29.719 --> 00:01:29.729 
happens is there can be many reasons but

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:31.399 
happens is there can be many reasons but
for<00:01:29.909> some<00:01:30.090> reason<00:01:30.420> the<00:01:30.540> plant<00:01:30.780> isn't<00:01:31.200> is

00:01:31.399 --> 00:01:31.409 
for some reason the plant isn't is

00:01:31.409 --> 00:01:34.429 
for some reason the plant isn't is
having<00:01:32.040> a<00:01:32.100> problem<00:01:32.659> taking<00:01:33.659> these<00:01:33.930> things<00:01:34.200> and

00:01:34.429 --> 00:01:34.439 
having a problem taking these things and

00:01:34.439 --> 00:01:36.370 
having a problem taking these things and
producing<00:01:34.979> proteins<00:01:35.520> and<00:01:35.850> carbohydrates

00:01:36.370 --> 00:01:36.380 
producing proteins and carbohydrates

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:38.929 
producing proteins and carbohydrates
some<00:01:37.380> kind<00:01:37.560> of<00:01:37.590> the<00:01:37.860> synthesis<00:01:38.369> of<00:01:38.460> protein<00:01:38.909> of

00:01:38.929 --> 00:01:38.939 
some kind of the synthesis of protein of

00:01:38.939 --> 00:01:41.240 
some kind of the synthesis of protein of
these<00:01:39.180> things<00:01:39.420> is<00:01:39.900> stopping<00:01:40.170> now<00:01:40.920> this<00:01:41.070> could

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:41.250 
these things is stopping now this could

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:45.410 
these things is stopping now this could
just<00:01:41.400> be<00:01:41.579> a<00:01:42.079> imbalance<00:01:43.079> of<00:01:44.060> minerals<00:01:45.060> you<00:01:45.329> know

00:01:45.410 --> 00:01:45.420 
just be a imbalance of minerals you know

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:48.020 
just be a imbalance of minerals you know
we<00:01:45.540> have<00:01:45.659> very<00:01:45.960> imbalanced<00:01:46.619> soil<00:01:47.009> it<00:01:47.579> could<00:01:47.850> be

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:48.030 
we have very imbalanced soil it could be

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:51.230 
we have very imbalanced soil it could be
a<00:01:48.420> poor<00:01:49.110> soil<00:01:49.409> food<00:01:49.619> web<00:01:50.030> where<00:01:51.030> we're<00:01:51.149> not

00:01:51.230 --> 00:01:51.240 
a poor soil food web where we're not

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:52.850 
a poor soil food web where we're not
they<00:01:51.420> don't<00:01:51.570> have<00:01:51.689> the<00:01:51.840> the<00:01:52.409> beneficial

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:52.860 
they don't have the the beneficial

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:54.679 
they don't have the the beneficial
microorganisms<00:01:53.100> to<00:01:53.670> help<00:01:53.820> them<00:01:54.000> out<00:01:54.119> it<00:01:54.540> could

00:01:54.679 --> 00:01:54.689 
microorganisms to help them out it could

00:01:54.689 --> 00:01:56.810 
microorganisms to help them out it could
be<00:01:54.780> a<00:01:54.810> water<00:01:55.049> issue<00:01:55.380> it<00:01:55.860> could<00:01:56.130> be<00:01:56.280> that<00:01:56.700> the

00:01:56.810 --> 00:01:56.820 
be a water issue it could be that the

00:01:56.820 --> 00:01:58.700 
be a water issue it could be that the
plant<00:01:57.060> got<00:01:57.180> injured<00:01:57.750> it<00:01:57.960> can<00:01:58.140> be<00:01:58.290> a<00:01:58.320> number<00:01:58.619> of

00:01:58.700 --> 00:01:58.710 
plant got injured it can be a number of

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:00.590 
plant got injured it can be a number of
things<00:01:58.890> so<00:01:59.520> on<00:01:59.700> its<00:01:59.880> own<00:02:00.030> it<00:02:00.210> doesn't<00:02:00.360> really

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:00.600 
things so on its own it doesn't really

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:02.630 
things so on its own it doesn't really
tell<00:02:00.780> us<00:02:00.930> that<00:02:01.140> much<00:02:01.530> but<00:02:02.130> there<00:02:02.250> are<00:02:02.369> a<00:02:02.399> couple

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:02.640 
tell us that much but there are a couple

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:06.130 
tell us that much but there are a couple
of<00:02:02.790> implications<00:02:03.090> for<00:02:03.659> us<00:02:03.810> gardeners<00:02:04.290> one<00:02:04.829> is

00:02:06.130 --> 00:02:06.140 
of implications for us gardeners one is

00:02:06.140 --> 00:02:10.930 
of implications for us gardeners one is
definitely<00:02:08.179> if<00:02:09.179> we<00:02:09.869> apply<00:02:10.110> too<00:02:10.170> much<00:02:10.319> nitrogen

00:02:10.930 --> 00:02:10.940 
definitely if we apply too much nitrogen

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:13.250 
definitely if we apply too much nitrogen
which<00:02:11.940> is<00:02:12.150> very<00:02:12.360> common<00:02:12.780> in<00:02:12.900> the<00:02:12.989> spring

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:13.260 
which is very common in the spring

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:13.760 
which is very common in the spring
especially

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:13.770 
especially

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:15.830 
especially
soluble<00:02:14.070> nitrogen<00:02:14.370> if<00:02:14.820> if<00:02:15.120> you<00:02:15.270> use<00:02:15.420> chemical

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:15.840 
soluble nitrogen if if you use chemical

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:18.140 
soluble nitrogen if if you use chemical
fertilizers<00:02:15.920> pile<00:02:16.920> them<00:02:17.130> on<00:02:17.280> the<00:02:17.400> lawn<00:02:17.610> in<00:02:18.060> the

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:18.150 
fertilizers pile them on the lawn in the

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:19.970 
fertilizers pile them on the lawn in the
spring<00:02:18.480> to<00:02:18.870> get<00:02:18.990> that<00:02:19.110> nice<00:02:19.260> green<00:02:19.530> up<00:02:19.770> and

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:19.980 
spring to get that nice green up and

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:23.570 
spring to get that nice green up and
even<00:02:20.220> into<00:02:20.430> the<00:02:20.460> garden<00:02:22.040> what's<00:02:23.040> gonna<00:02:23.130> happen

00:02:23.570 --> 00:02:23.580 
even into the garden what's gonna happen

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:25.610 
even into the garden what's gonna happen
is<00:02:23.850> often<00:02:24.750> you'll<00:02:24.870> see<00:02:24.930> later<00:02:25.140> in<00:02:25.350> the<00:02:25.440> summer

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:25.620 
is often you'll see later in the summer

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:27.980 
is often you'll see later in the summer
the<00:02:25.860> insects<00:02:26.250> come<00:02:26.490> to<00:02:26.640> dine<00:02:26.850> on<00:02:27.210> the<00:02:27.600> excess

00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:27.990 
the insects come to dine on the excess

00:02:27.990 --> 00:02:30.440 
the insects come to dine on the excess
nitrogen<00:02:28.320> so<00:02:29.040> we<00:02:29.250> don't<00:02:29.430> want<00:02:29.640> to<00:02:29.700> be<00:02:29.910> applying

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:30.450 
nitrogen so we don't want to be applying

00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:32.420 
nitrogen so we don't want to be applying
too<00:02:30.810> much<00:02:30.840> nitrogen<00:02:31.440> you<00:02:31.770> know<00:02:31.890> it's<00:02:32.280> an

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:32.430 
too much nitrogen you know it's an

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:36.230 
too much nitrogen you know it's an
important<00:02:33.500> nutrient<00:02:34.500> but<00:02:35.160> we<00:02:35.490> don't<00:02:35.640> want<00:02:36.180> to

00:02:36.230 --> 00:02:36.240 
important nutrient but we don't want to

00:02:36.240 --> 00:02:37.760 
important nutrient but we don't want to
apply<00:02:36.390> too<00:02:36.480> much<00:02:36.630> now<00:02:37.260> if<00:02:37.380> you're<00:02:37.500> applying

00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:37.770 
apply too much now if you're applying

00:02:37.770 --> 00:02:40.040 
apply too much now if you're applying
compost<00:02:38.130> it's<00:02:38.790> more<00:02:38.970> slow<00:02:39.270> release<00:02:39.600> so<00:02:39.900> that's

00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:40.050 
compost it's more slow release so that's

00:02:40.050 --> 00:02:41.750 
compost it's more slow release so that's
not<00:02:40.230> going<00:02:40.530> to<00:02:40.620> be<00:02:40.710> as<00:02:40.860> big<00:02:41.130> of<00:02:41.160> an<00:02:41.340> issue<00:02:41.460> but

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:41.760 
not going to be as big of an issue but

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:43.790 
not going to be as big of an issue but
you<00:02:41.910> can<00:02:42.180> apply<00:02:42.660> too<00:02:42.960> much<00:02:42.990> compost<00:02:43.650> and

00:02:43.790 --> 00:02:43.800 
you can apply too much compost and

00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:46.730 
you can apply too much compost and
especially<00:02:44.070> manure<00:02:44.520> as<00:02:44.760> well<00:02:45.230> anyway<00:02:46.230> my<00:02:46.560> main

00:02:46.730 --> 00:02:46.740 
especially manure as well anyway my main

00:02:46.740 --> 00:02:48.380 
especially manure as well anyway my main
point<00:02:46.980> there<00:02:47.160> is<00:02:47.310> let's<00:02:47.670> not<00:02:47.730> apply<00:02:48.090> too<00:02:48.150> much

00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:48.390 
point there is let's not apply too much

00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:50.330 
point there is let's not apply too much
nitrogen<00:02:49.080> at<00:02:49.230> any<00:02:49.380> one<00:02:49.620> time<00:02:49.650> because<00:02:50.130> that

00:02:50.330 --> 00:02:50.340 
nitrogen at any one time because that

00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:52.160 
nitrogen at any one time because that
can<00:02:50.490> cause<00:02:50.640> a<00:02:50.670> problem<00:02:50.850> the<00:02:51.420> other<00:02:51.600> one<00:02:51.840> the

00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:52.170 
can cause a problem the other one the

00:02:52.170 --> 00:02:55.330 
can cause a problem the other one the
interesting<00:02:52.920> thing<00:02:53.070> he<00:02:53.160> found<00:02:53.370> is<00:02:53.670> that

00:02:55.330 --> 00:02:55.340 
interesting thing he found is that

00:02:55.340 --> 00:02:59.060 
interesting thing he found is that
chemicals<00:02:56.340> especially<00:02:57.210> pesticides<00:02:58.070> caused

00:02:59.060 --> 00:02:59.070 
chemicals especially pesticides caused

00:02:59.070 --> 00:03:00.320 
chemicals especially pesticides caused
this<00:02:59.460> to<00:02:59.970> happen

00:03:00.320 --> 00:03:00.330 
this to happen

00:03:00.330 --> 00:03:02.390 
this to happen
they<00:03:00.690> sort<00:03:01.200> of<00:03:01.290> stimulate<00:03:01.890> this<00:03:02.010> response

00:03:02.390 --> 00:03:02.400 
they sort of stimulate this response

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:04.910 
they sort of stimulate this response
where<00:03:02.610> the<00:03:02.670> plant<00:03:02.880> can't<00:03:03.440> can't<00:03:04.440> form

00:03:04.910 --> 00:03:04.920 
where the plant can't can't form

00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:07.700 
where the plant can't can't form
proteins<00:03:05.550> and<00:03:05.790> carbohydrates<00:03:06.480> so<00:03:07.380> if<00:03:07.500> we're

00:03:07.700 --> 00:03:07.710 
proteins and carbohydrates so if we're

00:03:07.710 --> 00:03:09.770 
proteins and carbohydrates so if we're
spraying<00:03:07.950> an<00:03:08.190> insecticide<00:03:08.850> to<00:03:09.180> kill<00:03:09.210> insects

00:03:09.770 --> 00:03:09.780 
spraying an insecticide to kill insects

00:03:09.780 --> 00:03:12.140 
spraying an insecticide to kill insects
we<00:03:10.440> know<00:03:10.680> that<00:03:11.040> it<00:03:11.160> hurts<00:03:11.400> the<00:03:11.610> plant<00:03:11.850> it

00:03:12.140 --> 00:03:12.150 
we know that it hurts the plant it

00:03:12.150 --> 00:03:14.420 
we know that it hurts the plant it
causes<00:03:12.690> this<00:03:12.810> to<00:03:12.870> happen<00:03:12.990> in<00:03:13.290> a<00:03:13.350> plant<00:03:13.560> so<00:03:13.800> just

00:03:14.420 --> 00:03:14.430 
causes this to happen in a plant so just

00:03:14.430 --> 00:03:16.670 
causes this to happen in a plant so just
more<00:03:14.640> research<00:03:15.030> showing<00:03:15.300> that<00:03:15.650> you<00:03:16.650> know

00:03:16.670 --> 00:03:16.680 
more research showing that you know

00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:18.050 
more research showing that you know
spraying<00:03:17.310> any<00:03:17.460> kind<00:03:17.670> of<00:03:17.700> pesticide

00:03:18.050 --> 00:03:18.060 
spraying any kind of pesticide

00:03:18.060 --> 00:03:19.760 
spraying any kind of pesticide
insecticide<00:03:18.390> fungicide<00:03:19.020> these<00:03:19.530> things

00:03:19.760 --> 00:03:19.770 
insecticide fungicide these things

00:03:19.770 --> 00:03:21.470 
insecticide fungicide these things
affect<00:03:20.070> the<00:03:20.160> plants<00:03:20.459> do<00:03:20.610> they<00:03:20.820> affect<00:03:21.120> the

00:03:21.470 --> 00:03:21.480 
affect the plants do they affect the

00:03:21.480 --> 00:03:23.720 
affect the plants do they affect the
whole<00:03:21.660> soil<00:03:22.230> food<00:03:22.470> web<00:03:22.530> so<00:03:23.280> that's<00:03:23.430> the<00:03:23.550> main

00:03:23.720 --> 00:03:23.730 
whole soil food web so that's the main

00:03:23.730 --> 00:03:27.260 
whole soil food web so that's the main
thing<00:03:23.940> to<00:03:24.090> realize<00:03:24.420> I<00:03:25.910> guess<00:03:26.910> it's<00:03:27.209> really

00:03:27.260 --> 00:03:27.270 
thing to realize I guess it's really

00:03:27.270 --> 00:03:30.190 
thing to realize I guess it's really
just<00:03:27.870> more<00:03:28.080> proof<00:03:28.350> more<00:03:29.040> more<00:03:29.640> proof<00:03:29.910> that

00:03:30.190 --> 00:03:30.200 
just more proof more more proof that

00:03:30.200 --> 00:03:32.750 
just more proof more more proof that
only<00:03:31.200> sick<00:03:31.440> plants<00:03:31.830> get<00:03:31.980> attacked<00:03:32.250> if<00:03:32.459> a<00:03:32.550> plant

00:03:32.750 --> 00:03:32.760 
only sick plants get attacked if a plant

00:03:32.760 --> 00:03:34.760 
only sick plants get attacked if a plant
is<00:03:32.880> balanced<00:03:33.390> and<00:03:33.570> has<00:03:34.020> the<00:03:34.170> right<00:03:34.350> amount<00:03:34.500> of

00:03:40.160 --> 00:03:40.170 
create proteins and carbohydrates it's

00:03:40.170 --> 00:03:41.780 
create proteins and carbohydrates it's
not<00:03:40.410> going<00:03:40.620> to<00:03:40.680> be<00:03:40.800> food<00:03:41.010> for<00:03:41.040> the<00:03:41.370> insects

00:03:41.780 --> 00:03:41.790 
not going to be food for the insects

00:03:41.790 --> 00:03:43.820 
not going to be food for the insects
they<00:03:42.000> simply<00:03:42.330> won't<00:03:42.750> even<00:03:43.020> they<00:03:43.440> won't<00:03:43.590> even

00:03:43.820 --> 00:03:43.830 
they simply won't even they won't even

00:03:43.830 --> 00:03:47.120 
they simply won't even they won't even
find<00:03:44.040> the<00:03:44.190> plants<00:03:45.290> so<00:03:46.290> that's<00:03:46.530> just<00:03:46.890> what<00:03:47.100> I

00:03:47.120 --> 00:03:47.130 
find the plants so that's just what I

00:03:47.130 --> 00:03:48.710 
find the plants so that's just what I
wanted<00:03:47.340> to<00:03:47.430> talk<00:03:47.550> about<00:03:47.580> today<00:03:47.910> about<00:03:48.330> plant

00:03:48.710 --> 00:03:48.720 
wanted to talk about today about plant

00:03:48.720 --> 00:03:50.420 
wanted to talk about today about plant
sickness<00:03:49.200> it's<00:03:49.410> a<00:03:49.470> little<00:03:49.680> more<00:03:49.800> advanced<00:03:50.250> and

00:03:50.420 --> 00:03:50.430 
sickness it's a little more advanced and

00:03:50.430 --> 00:03:52.760 
sickness it's a little more advanced and
the<00:03:51.270> details<00:03:51.810> the<00:03:51.990> science<00:03:52.320> of<00:03:52.440> it<00:03:52.560> isn't
