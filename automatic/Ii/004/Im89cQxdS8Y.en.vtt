00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:04.230
 hi everyone guys and welcome to 

00:00:02.610 --> 00:00:06.899
 this new 100th installment of 

00:00:04.230 --> 00:00:09.750
 tunes then gentlemen what we will do 

00:00:06.899 --> 00:00:12.590
 in this episode and this episode 

00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:17.480
 we will create a character with character 

00:00:12.590 --> 00:00:20.010
 legendary very nice mister bean 

00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:21.960
 we go immediately to the screen of 

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:24.990
 character creation or a nice one 

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:27.269
 male created from the beginning then 

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:29.810
 our beautiful mister bean that 

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:33.600
 kind of face to a force rather 

00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:35.940
 angular we say and has a beard also 

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:38.250
 if not too accentuated 

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:40.350
 in fact usually one does not notice the same but 

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:42.239
 yet if you pay attention it has it 

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:45.210
 at least of the film 

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:48.270
 now for the hair we immediately suffered 

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:51.360
 to choose these ropes here well well 

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:53.340
 remember the character you are waiting for 

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:55.020
 these are certainly not here 

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:57.360
 these are much better because the 

00:00:55.020 --> 00:01:00.629
 the typical soup mister bean 

00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:02.070
 you can't really not use it 

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:04.880
 now let's go immediately 

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:08.610
 eyebrows second page gentlemen 

00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:11.010
 first line again which we can put 

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:12.930
 these here therefore have what they manage to do 

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:15.590
 to make the expression of a mister bean 

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:18.689
 really very very well 

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:22.310
 let's note one gentlemen and at this point 

00:01:18.689 --> 00:01:25.880
 let's enlarge 2 1 

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:30.470
 2 now gentlemen we just have an irl 

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:33.829
 and live perfect now we pass immediately 

00:01:30.470 --> 00:01:36.619
 in the eyes then I chelini service 

00:01:33.829 --> 00:01:37.700
 very expressive and truly unique 

00:01:36.619 --> 00:01:40.039
 in their kind 

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:42.350
 so we will have to put some beautiful ones 

00:01:40.039 --> 00:01:44.090
 ball eyes 

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:46.729
 don't worry about his understanding 

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:50.630
 what am I talking about obviously? 

00:01:46.729 --> 00:01:52.820
 shrunken brown eyes 1 if not 

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:55.909
 it really looks like a grouper effect 

00:01:52.820 --> 00:01:59.750
 at this point we move away from lady 4 1 2 3 

00:01:55.909 --> 00:02:04.369
 4 exactly like this a 

00:01:59.750 --> 00:02:06.289
 let's get them 3 3 2 3 perfect 

00:02:04.369 --> 00:02:08.479
 now let's turn to our nose like the 

00:02:06.289 --> 00:02:11.510
 nose but definitely taken this case 

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:16.880
 typical of an indoor mister bean we go there 

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:20.739
 of one is now at the symbol of saying up of 

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:23.480
 raise it one by one this way 

00:02:20.739 --> 00:02:25.880
 then gentlemen, however, we bring gods 

00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:29.180
 improvements then the eye must be worn 

00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:30.980
 a moment more exact 

00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:34.010
 as well as her eyebrows 

00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:35.810
 eyebrows more down then we see a 

00:02:34.010 --> 00:02:37.730
 little in this way we take the 

00:02:35.810 --> 00:02:39.609
 character wait with the opening a 

00:02:37.730 --> 00:02:42.829
 if there is something to change maybe 

00:02:39.609 --> 00:02:45.410
 because you always have to do while i 

00:02:42.829 --> 00:02:48.800
 characters be careful 

00:02:45.410 --> 00:02:50.060
 then the eyebrows are fine they go 

00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:53.180
 very very good 

00:02:50.060 --> 00:02:54.680
 here maybe we should curls to pass 

00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:58.010
 of another unit 

00:02:54.680 --> 00:03:00.980
 maybe yes exactly this way 

00:02:58.010 --> 00:03:04.700
 now for the eyes that I am in 

00:03:00.980 --> 00:03:07.270
 right position first perhaps to raise them 

00:03:04.700 --> 00:03:10.160
 no we are not keeping the desired effect 

00:03:07.270 --> 00:03:13.220
 because they would be too attached 

00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:15.320
 to the celine eyebrows we like one 

00:03:13.220 --> 00:03:16.850
 would be offered grouper so they are worth 

00:03:15.320 --> 00:03:20.300
 well so 

00:03:16.850 --> 00:03:21.590
 now the nose and you don't go very much 

00:03:20.300 --> 00:03:23.780
 well 

00:03:21.590 --> 00:03:25.460
 let's try to enlarge no so it is 

00:03:23.780 --> 00:03:27.050
 really too disproportionate 

00:03:25.460 --> 00:03:30.470
 we lower one and the perfect years 

00:03:27.050 --> 00:03:32.620
 Lord this is the real coach now b 

00:03:30.470 --> 00:03:36.260
 let's move on to her beautiful mouth 

00:03:32.620 --> 00:03:38.960
 let's take this third and do it 

00:03:36.260 --> 00:03:42.080
 the typical smiled mesh of 222 

00:03:38.960 --> 00:03:45.950
 very well and at this point let's pass it 

00:03:42.080 --> 00:03:48.920
 we then made one of those gentlemen 

00:03:45.950 --> 00:03:51.740
 even with the mouth and if you see it is just 

00:03:48.920 --> 00:03:53.570
 the sterling boccherini however see us 

00:03:51.740 --> 00:03:56.180
 still something that does not convince me in 

00:03:53.570 --> 00:03:59.740
 this character that must be there 

00:03:56.180 --> 00:04:02.810
 less space between the mouth and the beard 

00:03:59.740 --> 00:04:04.790
 because the mouth must be attached 

00:04:02.810 --> 00:04:06.390
 here therefore gentlemen perhaps we should 

00:04:04.790 --> 00:04:08.970
 lower some more 

00:04:06.390 --> 00:04:13.560
 from the nose and from the eyebrows are 

00:04:08.970 --> 00:04:16.140
 perfect perhaps this very breath 

00:04:13.560 --> 00:04:17.359
 well this is really the form 

00:04:16.140 --> 00:04:20.910
 optimal 

00:04:17.359 --> 00:04:23.820
 we have his great mole 

00:04:20.910 --> 00:04:26.160
 the biggest one, however, is her new a 

00:04:23.820 --> 00:04:29.340
 this point we enlarge it not 

00:04:26.160 --> 00:04:33.900
 we receive two by merit and 

00:04:29.340 --> 00:04:39.840
 let's move the gentlemen of 11 1 or 2 3 4 5 6 

00:04:33.900 --> 00:04:42.120
 7 8 9 10 11 is exactly below 

00:04:39.840 --> 00:04:43.260
 the eye so that it almost continues 

00:04:42.120 --> 00:04:45.510
 mouth 

00:04:43.260 --> 00:04:47.190
 so now let's go to the height of 

00:04:45.510 --> 00:04:49.710
 mister view 

00:04:47.190 --> 00:04:53.550
 let's do it a still adult person 

00:04:49.710 --> 00:04:55.860
 a very very thin person 

00:04:53.550 --> 00:04:57.870
 exact well at this point sir 

00:04:55.860 --> 00:05:00.750
 we have completed our mythical hero 

00:04:57.870 --> 00:05:03.720
 the jacket obviously and a complexion 

00:05:00.750 --> 00:05:08.210
 brown and soprano we call ladies e 

00:05:03.720 --> 00:05:13.460
 mister no plan enne that has to do with mister 

00:05:08.210 --> 00:05:16.110
 benin capital letter and that's it 

00:05:13.460 --> 00:05:19.020
 very good gentlemen we have also created 

00:05:16.110 --> 00:05:21.470
 this other character let's stop with 

00:05:19.020 --> 00:05:25.830
 mm and we throw in our beautiful 

00:05:21.470 --> 00:05:27.990
 really sought after gentlemen square 

00:05:25.830 --> 00:05:30.150

00:05:27.990 --> 00:05:32.280
 people in the next installment of 

00:05:30.150 --> 00:05:34.230
 we'll find out with something else about di 

00:05:32.280 --> 00:05:35.910
 so special music for this one 

00:05:34.230 --> 00:05:39.169
 mii creation center episode is 

00:05:35.910 --> 00:05:39.169
