months ago we were quizzing who was
going<00:00:45.360> to<00:00:45.420> play<00:00:45.600> that<00:00:45.899> role<00:00:45.960> and<00:00:46.440> who<00:00:46.860> was<00:00:47.010> the

00:00:47.119 --> 00:00:47.129 
going to play that role and who was the

00:00:50.389 --> 00:00:50.399 
chipperfield we appear to have found the

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:52.189 
chipperfield we appear to have found the
solution<00:00:50.550> in<00:00:50.910> Jason<00:00:51.300> Davidson<00:00:51.629> and<00:00:51.899> he<00:00:51.989> seems

00:00:52.189 --> 00:00:52.199 
solution in Jason Davidson and he seems

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:53.540 
solution in Jason Davidson and he seems
really<00:00:52.320> to<00:00:52.710> be<00:00:52.829> growing<00:00:53.129> into<00:00:53.280> the<00:00:53.370> role

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:53.550 
really to be growing into the role

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:55.520 
really to be growing into the role
nicely<00:00:54.000> some<00:00:54.180> they're<00:00:54.360> still<00:00:54.539> there<00:00:54.930> still<00:00:55.379> a

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:55.530 
nicely some they're still there still a

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:57.799 
nicely some they're still there still a
few<00:00:55.710> areas<00:00:55.890> defensively<00:00:56.520> where<00:00:56.820> he<00:00:57.510> needs<00:00:57.690> to

00:00:57.799 --> 00:00:57.809 
few areas defensively where he needs to

00:00:57.809 --> 00:00:59.150 
few areas defensively where he needs to
pay<00:00:57.960> a<00:00:57.989> bit<00:00:58.140> more<00:00:58.170> attention<00:00:58.410> but<00:00:58.920> that<00:00:59.039> will

00:00:59.150 --> 00:00:59.160 
pay a bit more attention but that will

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:00.529 
pay a bit more attention but that will
come<00:00:59.280> with<00:00:59.340> more<00:00:59.640> and<00:00:59.789> more<00:00:59.850> games<00:01:00.149> he's<00:01:00.420> going

00:01:00.529 --> 00:01:00.539 
come with more and more games he's going

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:02.240 
come with more and more games he's going
to<00:01:00.600> be<00:01:00.719> under<00:01:01.020> intense<00:01:01.559> scrutiny<00:01:01.710> against

Chile there's no doubt about that both
fullbacks<00:01:03.870> will<00:01:04.049> be<00:01:04.199> because<00:01:04.920> Chile<00:01:05.159> plays

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:05.430 
fullbacks will be because Chile plays
