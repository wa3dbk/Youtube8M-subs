the consumption reduction

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:38.469 
the consumption reduction
want<00:01:37.259> some<00:01:37.469> more<00:01:37.590> consumption<00:01:38.130> means

00:01:38.469 --> 00:01:38.479 
want some more consumption means

00:01:38.479 --> 00:01:41.569 
want some more consumption means
performance<00:01:39.479> first<00:01:40.079> up<00:01:40.259> this<00:01:40.469> is<00:01:40.740> the<00:01:41.009> way<00:01:41.189> the

00:01:41.569 --> 00:01:41.579 
performance first up this is the way the

00:01:41.579 --> 00:01:43.880 
performance first up this is the way the
engineers<00:01:42.240> can<00:01:42.509> directly<00:01:43.020> contribute<00:01:43.590> to<00:01:43.740> the

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:43.890 
engineers can directly contribute to the

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:45.590 
engineers can directly contribute to the
car's<00:01:44.100> performance<00:01:44.310> and<00:01:45.090> I<00:01:45.149> said<00:01:45.329> that<00:01:45.450> there

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:45.600 
car's performance and I said that there

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:47.749 
car's performance and I said that there
won't<00:01:45.750> be<00:01:46.020> any<00:01:46.289> refuelling<00:01:47.159> anymore<00:01:47.520> so

00:01:47.749 --> 00:01:47.759 
won't be any refuelling anymore so

00:01:47.759 --> 00:01:49.940 
won't be any refuelling anymore so
consuming<00:01:48.509> less<00:01:48.689> means<00:01:49.020> less<00:01:49.470> petrol<00:01:49.860> on

00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:49.950 
consuming less means less petrol on

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:52.179 
consuming less means less petrol on
board<00:01:50.250> and<00:01:50.700> therefore<00:01:51.119> better<00:01:51.420> lap<00:01:51.719> times

00:01:52.179 --> 00:01:52.189 
board and therefore better lap times

00:01:52.189 --> 00:01:55.460 
board and therefore better lap times
whoever<00:01:53.189> consumes<00:01:53.789> less<00:01:53.909> will<00:01:54.450> be<00:01:54.600> faster<00:01:55.020> on

00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:55.470 
whoever consumes less will be faster on

00:01:55.470 --> 00:01:58.910 
whoever consumes less will be faster on
the<00:01:55.590> track<00:01:55.799> I<00:01:57.319> haven't<00:01:58.319> said<00:01:58.439> anything<00:01:58.710> about

00:02:11.990 --> 00:02:12.000 
consumes less this brings about higher

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:14.750 
consumes less this brings about higher

very hard during the winter with our
simulations<00:02:17.040> and<00:02:17.280> so<00:02:17.940> we're<00:02:18.180> confident<00:02:18.660> that

00:02:18.770 --> 00:02:18.780 
simulations and so we're confident that

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:20.990 
simulations and so we're confident that
our<00:02:18.959> package<00:02:19.410> will<00:02:19.650> definitely<00:02:20.400> be<00:02:20.549> reliable

00:02:20.990 --> 00:02:21.000 
our package will definitely be reliable

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:22.880 
our package will definitely be reliable
at<00:02:21.120> the<00:02:21.209> start<00:02:21.480> for<00:02:21.660> season<00:02:22.110> and<00:02:22.709> will

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:22.890 
at the start for season and will

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:25.190 
at the start for season and will
continue<00:02:23.250> working<00:02:23.640> on<00:02:23.910> it<00:02:24.090> in<00:02:25.080> our

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:26.790 
simulations we've always been very

00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:29.089 
simulations we've always been very
attentive<00:02:27.239> as<00:02:27.840> far<00:02:28.079> as<00:02:28.200> the<00:02:28.290> engines<00:02:28.709> use<00:02:28.890> on
