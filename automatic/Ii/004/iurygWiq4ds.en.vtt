00:00:07.139 --> 00:00:10.260
 congratulations we would like to know how 

00:00:08.519 --> 00:00:11.549
 it was the experience of having won a 

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:12.990
 trophy nothing less than in China a 

00:00:11.549 --> 00:00:15.179
 culture completely different from the 

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:17.970
 ours when thank you very much yes yes 

00:00:15.179 --> 00:00:19.470
 the truth that is very different and we 

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:23.530
 cost being a little bit the first 

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:26.320
 days but then we are not and we could 

00:00:23.530 --> 00:00:28.540
 to bring the goal that I was very clear 

00:00:26.320 --> 00:00:30.820
 we went to the Argentine he meant for 

00:00:28.540 --> 00:00:32.380
 you who have consecrated you champion with 

00:00:30.820 --> 00:00:34.480
 ribera abroad a tournament 

00:00:32.380 --> 00:00:36.100
 international apart from the category of 

00:00:34.480 --> 00:00:37.600
 sub-20 your club neighbor comes in handy 

00:00:36.100 --> 00:00:42.220
 come also to win the cup in 

00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:44.650
 dallas and it's something nice because you 

00:00:42.220 --> 00:00:47.500
 you go to another country and do not know what it is 

00:00:44.650 --> 00:00:49.629
 the theme of language soccer 

00:00:47.500 --> 00:00:52.030
 cultures and we went with a 

00:00:49.629 --> 00:00:54.250
 goal was to come out champion bring us the 

00:00:52.030 --> 00:00:56.980
 goal that was the cup 

00:00:54.250 --> 00:00:59.260
 it had not happened in the USA that we could 

00:00:56.980 --> 00:01:00.820
 bring the cup too and good is something is 

00:00:59.260 --> 00:01:03.070
 something nice because we showed that river 

00:01:00.820 --> 00:01:05.409
 It is great and we are also in 

00:01:03.070 --> 00:01:07.659
 a good level of what is and group and what 

00:01:05.409 --> 00:01:09.220
 football and that's good any 

00:01:07.659 --> 00:01:10.570
 funny anecdote I imagine that there 

00:01:09.220 --> 00:01:12.760
 in china with the language theme too 

00:01:10.570 --> 00:01:14.710
 they must have had enough and if the 

00:01:12.760 --> 00:01:16.450
 true that when when none of the 

00:01:14.710 --> 00:01:18.100
 two is understood a lot especially because 

00:01:16.450 --> 00:01:20.380
 I did not speak English us much 

00:01:18.100 --> 00:01:21.700
 neither can you and he stole us here 

00:01:20.380 --> 00:01:24.340
 we go with signal and there they are generated 

00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:27.100
 confusions and there we laughed all 

00:01:24.340 --> 00:01:29.500
 a little but it is not said of one in 

00:01:27.100 --> 00:01:34.530
 special that I remember at this time 

00:01:29.500 --> 00:01:37.719
 that the Chinese the technicians one day at 

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:40.060
 5 or 6 at 8 o'clock appear by the 

00:01:37.719 --> 00:01:43.630
 selector appreciates me 8 nothing but 

00:01:40.060 --> 00:01:45.850
 good is the time change and there are many 

00:01:43.630 --> 00:01:48.340
 things that are either left in the group there are 

00:01:45.850 --> 00:01:49.750
 anecdote that what we remember now 

00:01:48.340 --> 00:01:51.130
 but there are a lot of things that happened 

00:01:49.750 --> 00:01:53.049
 that were very good and we had a lot 

00:01:51.130 --> 00:01:54.850
