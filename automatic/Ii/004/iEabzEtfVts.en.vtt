 naturally you guys saw me 

00:03:42.140 --> 00:03:48.200
 I use some important tricks 

00:03:45.220 --> 00:03:52.010
 actually one of the most important tricks 

00:03:48.200 --> 00:03:54.920
 to make these all stuff trinkets 

00:03:52.010 --> 00:03:57.020
 and so on in general guys if you 

00:03:54.920 --> 00:03:58.760
 joystick from x portion i hope u 

00:03:57.020 --> 00:04:02.330
 most joystick instructions for clave 

00:03:58.760 --> 00:04:04.730
 Unfortunately I do not know the general tin xbox that 

00:04:02.330 --> 00:04:07.490
 find who is already leaving left before 

00:04:04.730 --> 00:04:11.030
 throwing yourself 1 ball called nowhere 

00:04:07.490 --> 00:04:12.560
 general guys what needs to be done on 

00:04:11.030 --> 00:04:15.830
 joystick to actually this movie 

00:04:12.560 --> 00:04:19.280
 it turned out you need to hold lt 

00:04:15.830 --> 00:04:21.380
 that is, this button this this this 

00:04:19.280 --> 00:04:23.560
 actually l b and this is lt 

00:04:21.380 --> 00:04:26.630
 if on playstation you are l2 

00:04:23.560 --> 00:04:29.750
 Naturally stick where you want to do 

00:04:26.630 --> 00:04:32.060
 This trick itself direction naturally 

00:04:29.750 --> 00:04:34.310
 buttons that is this red one 

00:04:32.060 --> 00:04:37.370
 and green fast order that is 

00:04:34.310 --> 00:04:40.550
 it is as if you play some 

00:04:37.370 --> 00:04:43.430
 the tool itself is completely this 

00:04:40.550 --> 00:04:46.550
 It looks like this, that is, clamping lt and 

00:04:43.430 --> 00:04:50.810
 here's the back and do it like this 

00:04:46.550 --> 00:04:52.669
 so here it does not matter in general it was 

00:04:50.810 --> 00:04:55.190
 the second method will actually go to 

00:04:52.669 --> 00:04:58.280
 third world so guys actually third 

00:04:55.190 --> 00:05:01.490
 way to build on a penalty and 

00:04:58.280 --> 00:05:05.990
 called the pump in general its essence 

00:05:01.490 --> 00:05:08.050

00:05:05.990 --> 00:05:11.530

 all sorts of prints to do so 

00:05:18.729 --> 00:05:22.690
 so that your opponent never took the ball 

00:05:20.680 --> 00:05:25.419
 Well, actually the opponent ends 

00:05:22.690 --> 00:05:27.970
 patience he cannot play well 

00:05:25.419 --> 00:05:30.610
