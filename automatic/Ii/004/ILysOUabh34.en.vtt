00:04:58.720 --> 00:04:58.730 
the heisman let's guys looks like a

00:04:58.730 --> 00:05:02.440 
the heisman let's guys looks like a
hoverboard<00:04:59.210> with<00:04:59.870> the<00:04:59.960> propeller<00:05:00.260> on<00:05:00.470> it<00:05:01.450> the

hoverboard with the propeller on it the

00:05:02.450 --> 00:05:03.550 
hoverboard with the propeller on it the
evens<00:05:02.720> are<00:05:02.840> less<00:05:02.960> cool<00:05:03.170> because<00:05:03.290> they<00:05:03.410> don't

00:05:03.550 --> 00:05:03.560 
evens are less cool because they don't

00:05:03.560 --> 00:05:05.320

have<00:05:03.590> propellers<00:05:03.950> they've<00:05:04.730> like<00:05:04.910> things<00:05:05.210> that

00:05:05.320 --> 00:05:05.330 
have propellers they've like things that

00:05:05.330 --> 00:05:11.030 
have propellers they've like things that
just<00:05:05.450> come<00:05:05.690> off<00:05:07.690> all<00:05:08.690> right

00:05:11.030 --> 00:05:11.040 

00:05:11.040 --> 00:05:13.520 

make<00:05:11.940> that<00:05:12.060> leave<00:05:12.270> I<00:05:12.510> guess<00:05:12.840> it<00:05:13.020> might<00:05:13.350> have

00:05:13.520 --> 00:05:13.530 
make that leave I guess it might have

00:05:13.530 --> 00:05:15.830 
make that leave I guess it might have
been<00:05:13.590> safer<00:05:13.980> to<00:05:14.100> ride<00:05:14.850> that<00:05:14.880> little<00:05:15.420> screw

00:05:15.830 --> 00:05:15.840 
been safer to ride that little screw

00:05:15.840 --> 00:05:19.340 
been safer to ride that little screw
