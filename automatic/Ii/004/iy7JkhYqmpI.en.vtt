00:00:01.890 --> 00:00:05.819
 Welcome back to class of class and 

00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:07.230
 let's witness just live as 

00:00:05.819 --> 00:00:08.130
 they are attacking me because I was going to put 

00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:09.929
 to record and I have seen that they are 

00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:12.300
 attacking so I've decided as soon as 

00:00:09.929 --> 00:00:13.650
 possible to record and see then the 

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:14.910
 attack that they are doing to me in first 

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:16.770
 instead they have thrown a lot of porta 

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:18.210
 pigs as you see, they are attacking me 

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:19.560
 someone who is higher level than me 

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:21.689
 because I still have not got pigs 

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:23.550
 but let's see what we get 

00:00:21.689 --> 00:00:25.199
 guys, I'm getting nervous to see 

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:26.939
 to see what is going on here what 

00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:28.439
 first I have is antiaircraft perfect not 

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:30.869
 I remembered that I had left that gap 

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:32.369
 for war thing that maybe it's going to 

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:33.840
 cost quite expensive but let's hope that 

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:35.160
 please do not come to the wizard tower 

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:36.840

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:38.610
 13% came time tower d'en to 

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:41.219
 bolivia everything perfect to get out is the 

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:43.140
 incredible either and it is here 

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:44.370
 incredible but the defense and you are in the 

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:46.890
 defense of my village to see what they have said 

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:50.730
 the plan subscribers the owl clan 

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:52.050
 perfect vale attack the water they become 

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:53.820
 crazy people go crazy you know what 

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:57.030
 mean these guys that the clan 

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:59.969
 imperfectly perfect perfect 15% 

00:00:57.030 --> 00:01:02.100
 they make me guys this war promises this 

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:04.290
 War really the clan is bursting 

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:05.580
 surely you have just seen the defense 

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:07.110
 what I just did is given to me 

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:09.240
 to the recording but I'm still here with 

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:11.370
 you because you know what I say to you 

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:12.840
 I say that the clan is butt that the clan 

00:01:11.370 --> 00:01:14.730
 he really wants to see you are there 

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:16.800
 supporting each battle each war each 

00:01:14.730 --> 00:01:20.490
 everything and tell you that this war has 

00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:22.530
 started very very very well to tell you that the 

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:25.740
 Clan is willing to give everything but I 

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:28.170
 like the figure of 150 likes for 

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:29.580
 make another war report this same 

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:31.650
 week this war was totally 

00:01:29.580 --> 00:01:33.870
 improvised we did not have other spells 

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:36.240
 they did not have barracks and still we did the 

00:01:33.870 --> 00:01:38.010
 war and what's up we're bursting 

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:40.290
 more than ever I'm going to put a simple 

00:01:38.010 --> 00:01:41.400
 I advance guys my attack the best 

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:43.290
 attack that I have done so far in 

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:44.850
 I'm going to put it to you and I hope that 

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:48.240
 enjoy and tell you that this is a 

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:51.330
 simple insignificant advancement is to say 

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:53.550
 one of the worst attacks on this village and 

00:01:51.330 --> 00:01:56.010
 the best organized by me the best 

00:01:53.550 --> 00:01:58.860
 performed better amazing bone 

00:01:56.010 --> 00:02:00.990
 honestly this attack has enchanted me 

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:02.610
 to start shooting two barbarians down 

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:04.770
 towards the laboratory thing that I get 

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:06.810
 between balloons because I did not expect it for 

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:08.610
 nothing sincerely and now let's throw 

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:10.980
 up here a barbarian are going to see 

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:12.540
 that the strategy was simple was that 

00:02:10.980 --> 00:02:14.579
 the balloons just be 

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:17.310
 and that corner the map to eliminate them 

00:02:14.579 --> 00:02:19.349
 well with magicians or with 

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:21.719
 archers in this case has a barbarian 

00:02:19.349 --> 00:02:23.069
 over here because it escapes me and what happens 

00:02:21.719 --> 00:02:25.530
 because the balloons are turned around 

00:02:23.069 --> 00:02:27.209
 so what do I have to do now? 

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:29.250
 simply what you have to do now is 

00:02:27.209 --> 00:02:30.840
 get nervous because it could not be a 

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:32.430
 combat of mine without getting nervous shot 

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:34.859
 all the archers and has a few 

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:36.090
 wizards to do this as it comes out 

00:02:34.859 --> 00:02:37.799
 more unless, so that a 

00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:40.709
 little before this elimination of 

00:02:37.799 --> 00:02:42.719
 perfect castle once we do this 

00:02:40.709 --> 00:02:44.430
 is simply what we are going to do is 

00:02:42.719 --> 00:02:45.840
 throw the clan castle with four 

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:48.090
 mounts ports to eliminate 

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:49.709
 defenses and I'm going to do it very well 

00:02:48.090 --> 00:02:51.389
 he rides them pigs because then what good 

00:02:49.709 --> 00:02:53.220
 first let them do their little 

00:02:51.389 --> 00:02:54.840
 work removes a few defenses and 

00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:56.519
 threw some balloons to eliminate that tower 

00:02:54.840 --> 00:02:58.409
 magicians accompanied by a few 

00:02:56.519 --> 00:03:00.090
 minions and you'll see that the move 

00:02:58.409 --> 00:03:01.379
 the mountain is amazing and I know 

00:03:00.090 --> 00:03:03.450
 practically eliminates what's coming 

00:03:01.379 --> 00:03:06.030
 being anti-aircraft and now I shoot balloons 

00:03:03.450 --> 00:03:08.069
 in a scattered way because then by itself 

00:03:06.030 --> 00:03:10.290
 a bomb goes out that does not give everyone to the 

00:03:08.069 --> 00:03:12.269
 Once you see my main objective is 

00:03:10.290 --> 00:03:14.069
 throw the tower of archers that are the 

00:03:12.269 --> 00:03:16.409
 air defenses as he says are 

00:03:14.069 --> 00:03:19.090
 hybrid defenses but as I've seen it has 

00:03:16.409 --> 00:03:21.489
 come out a bomb has given a group of 2 

00:03:19.090 --> 00:03:23.140
 balloons but you have not done anything why 

00:03:21.489 --> 00:03:25.269
 Well, because this strategy is very 

00:03:23.140 --> 00:03:27.489
 Well done the truth I loved it 

00:03:25.269 --> 00:03:29.769
 did favorite attacks are the airs already 

00:03:27.489 --> 00:03:32.260
 you know and my favorite troops are the 

00:03:29.769 --> 00:03:34.569
 balloons in combination with minions or 

00:03:32.260 --> 00:03:37.090
 above all I already tell you all the air I 

00:03:34.569 --> 00:03:38.980
 love and ride pigs and not notice 

00:03:37.090 --> 00:03:40.930
 for me the pigs ride is that they have 

00:03:38.980 --> 00:03:42.220
 to the guys and this has been the best 

00:03:40.930 --> 00:03:45.489
 attack that I have done so far in 

00:03:42.220 --> 00:03:46.989
 war tell you that you have to see that the 

00:03:45.489 --> 00:03:49.030
 better attack than done in war with my 

00:03:46.989 --> 00:03:51.459
 level that is fine for my level and not 

00:03:49.030 --> 00:03:53.670
 you compare with you and this is the 

00:03:51.459 --> 00:03:56.290
 advance guys you want to see this war
