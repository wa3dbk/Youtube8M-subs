00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:42.310 
do that requires tremendous computer

00:00:42.310 --> 00:00:44.220 
do that requires tremendous computer
resources<00:00:42.850> and<00:00:43.030> that's<00:00:43.510> the<00:00:43.810> point<00:00:44.079> of

00:00:44.220 --> 00:00:44.230

today's<00:00:44.440> video<00:00:45.480> so<00:00:46.480> how<00:00:46.600> much<00:00:46.750> data<00:00:47.079> are<00:00:47.290> we

00:00:47.400 --> 00:00:47.410 
today's video so how much data are we

00:00:47.410 --> 00:00:50.010 
today's video so how much data are we
talking<00:00:47.770> about<00:00:47.829> just<00:00:48.430> how<00:00:49.059> much<00:00:49.570> information

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:50.020 
talking about just how much information

00:00:50.020 --> 00:00:53.970 
talking about just how much information
is<00:00:50.530> recorded<00:00:50.860> by<00:00:51.460> an<00:00:51.579> LHC<00:00:52.000> experiment<00:00:52.510> I<00:00:52.980> could

00:00:53.970 --> 00:00:53.980 
is recorded by an LHC experiment I could

00:00:53.980 --> 00:00:56.340 
is recorded by an LHC experiment I could
make<00:00:54.130> this<00:00:54.250> a<00:00:54.309> short<00:00:54.640> video<00:00:54.820> into<00:00:55.180> say<00:00:55.390> 20

00:00:56.340 --> 00:00:56.350 
make this a short video into say 20

make this a short video into say 20
