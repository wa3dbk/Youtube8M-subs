roughly 50 K bubble on people they have
however<00:01:25.499> put<00:01:26.279> our<00:01:26.459> rapture<00:01:26.999> back<00:01:27.179> into<00:01:27.509> the

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:27.630 
however put our rapture back into the

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:30.830 
however put our rapture back into the
game<00:01:27.779> so<00:01:28.560> you<00:01:28.950> know<00:01:29.130> it's<00:01:29.429> not<00:01:29.729> all<00:01:29.969> gone<00:01:30.659> to

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:30.840 
game so you know it's not all gone to

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:34.020 
game so you know it's not all gone to
waste<00:01:32.119> so

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:34.030 
waste so

00:01:34.030 --> 00:01:37.890 
waste so
pretty<00:01:34.840> much<00:01:35.280> disc<00:01:36.280> priests<00:01:36.610> now<00:01:37.030> all<00:01:37.390> they

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:37.900 
pretty much disc priests now all they

00:01:37.900 --> 00:01:41.609 
pretty much disc priests now all they
can<00:01:38.200> do<00:01:38.590> is<00:01:38.860> tank<00:01:39.700> heal<00:01:40.090> and<00:01:40.450> I<00:01:40.750> think<00:01:41.080> the<00:01:41.290> idea

00:01:41.609 --> 00:01:41.619 
can do is tank heal and I think the idea

00:01:41.619 --> 00:01:44.880 
can do is tank heal and I think the idea
behind<00:01:41.860> them<00:01:42.250> is<00:01:42.520> is<00:01:43.380> that<00:01:44.380> we<00:01:44.500> pretty<00:01:44.770> much

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:44.890 
behind them is is that we pretty much

00:01:44.890 --> 00:01:49.380 
behind them is is that we pretty much
keep<00:01:45.509> our<00:01:47.190> spirit<00:01:48.190> shell<00:01:48.490> on<00:01:48.729> the<00:01:48.790> tank

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:49.390 
keep our spirit shell on the tank

00:01:49.390 --> 00:01:52.020 
keep our spirit shell on the tank
constantly<00:01:50.080> so<00:01:50.350> their<00:01:50.530> health<00:01:50.830> doesn't<00:01:51.550> need

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:52.030 
constantly so their health doesn't need

00:01:52.030 --> 00:01:55.620 
constantly so their health doesn't need
to<00:01:52.360> drop<00:01:52.659> I<00:01:52.990> think<00:01:53.619> that<00:01:53.680> is<00:01:53.950> the<00:01:54.460> kind<00:01:54.909> of<00:01:55.090> idea

00:01:55.620 --> 00:01:55.630 
to drop I think that is the kind of idea

00:01:55.630 --> 00:01:58.170 
to drop I think that is the kind of idea
that<00:01:55.899> Blizzard<00:01:56.259> had<00:01:56.470> behind<00:01:56.830> the<00:01:57.580> disc<00:01:57.820> priest

00:01:58.170 --> 00:01:58.180 
that Blizzard had behind the disc priest

00:01:58.180 --> 00:02:00.480 
that Blizzard had behind the disc priest
and<00:01:58.450> then<00:01:58.600> you<00:01:59.259> know<00:01:59.380> it<00:01:59.500> in<00:01:59.619> between<00:01:59.770> bubbling

00:02:00.480 --> 00:02:00.490 
and then you know it in between bubbling

00:02:00.490 --> 00:02:02.399 
and then you know it in between bubbling
and<00:02:00.640> stuff<00:02:00.940> all<00:02:01.570> these<00:02:01.810> we<00:02:01.990> have<00:02:02.170> is<00:02:02.290> our

00:02:02.399 --> 00:02:02.409 
and stuff all these we have is our

00:02:02.409 --> 00:02:04.980 
and stuff all these we have is our
prayer<00:02:02.710> of<00:02:02.799> mending<00:02:02.950> so<00:02:03.450> whenever<00:02:04.450> our<00:02:04.540> spirit

00:02:04.980 --> 00:02:04.990 
prayer of mending so whenever our spirit

00:02:04.990 --> 00:02:06.510 
prayer of mending so whenever our spirit
shelves<00:02:05.350> going<00:02:05.619> to<00:02:05.710> fall<00:02:05.890> off<00:02:05.920> you<00:02:06.280> know<00:02:06.369> we've

00:03:02.289 --> 00:03:02.299 
because look as you can see here we

00:03:02.299 --> 00:03:05.500 
because look as you can see here we
cannot<00:03:02.689> heal<00:03:03.200> we<00:03:03.439> just<00:03:03.849> we<00:03:04.849> just<00:03:04.879> don't<00:03:05.239> have

00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:05.510 
cannot heal we just we just don't have

healing<00:03:05.930> spells<00:03:06.590> we<00:03:07.069> just<00:03:07.370> we<00:03:08.209> can<00:03:08.390> only

00:03:08.559 --> 00:03:08.569 
healing spells we just we can only

00:03:08.569 --> 00:03:11.830 
healing spells we just we can only
really<00:03:09.019> absorb<00:03:09.560> things<00:03:09.829> so<00:03:10.099> i<00:03:10.129> think<00:03:10.540> the<00:03:11.540> spec

00:03:11.830 --> 00:03:11.840 
really absorb things so i think the spec

00:03:11.840 --> 00:03:13.390 
really absorb things so i think the spec
that<00:03:11.870> we<00:03:12.140> are<00:03:12.260> going<00:03:12.440> to<00:03:12.530> pretty<00:03:12.859> much<00:03:13.010> need<00:03:13.370> to

00:03:13.390 --> 00:03:13.400 
that we are going to pretty much need to

00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:17.619 
that we are going to pretty much need to
play<00:03:13.849> for<00:03:13.909> dungeons<00:03:14.810> and<00:03:15.049> stuff<00:03:15.349> is<00:03:16.510> going<00:03:17.510> to

00:03:17.619 --> 00:03:17.629 
play for dungeons and stuff is going to

00:03:17.629 --> 00:03:20.319 
play for dungeons and stuff is going to
have<00:03:17.750> to<00:03:17.930> be<00:03:18.049> wholly<00:03:18.319> I<00:03:18.500> think<00:03:18.889> disc<00:03:19.760> is<00:03:20.090> going

00:03:20.319 --> 00:03:20.329 
have to be wholly I think disc is going

00:03:20.329 --> 00:03:22.809 
have to be wholly I think disc is going
to<00:03:20.510> be<00:03:20.690> not<00:03:21.109> even<00:03:21.349> a<00:03:21.440> 10-month<00:03:22.010> focus<00:03:22.489> spec

00:03:22.809 --> 00:03:22.819 
to be not even a 10-month focus spec

00:03:22.819 --> 00:03:25.179 
to be not even a 10-month focus spec
it's<00:03:23.060> going<00:03:23.209> to<00:03:23.269> be<00:03:23.389> pretty<00:03:23.959> much<00:03:24.230> a<00:03:24.260> 25-man

00:03:25.179 --> 00:03:25.189 
it's going to be pretty much a 25-man

00:03:25.189 --> 00:03:29.649 
it's going to be pretty much a 25-man
only<00:03:25.790> kind<00:03:26.269> of<00:03:26.420> focus<00:03:26.870> build<00:03:28.329> do<00:03:29.329> and

00:03:29.649 --> 00:03:29.659 
only kind of focus build do and

00:03:29.659 --> 00:03:31.509 
only kind of focus build do and
basically<00:03:30.290> you're<00:03:30.439> you're<00:03:30.920> going<00:03:31.069> to<00:03:31.159> assign

00:03:31.509 --> 00:03:31.519 
basically you're you're going to assign

00:03:31.519 --> 00:03:33.339 
basically you're you're going to assign
your<00:03:31.760> disc<00:03:32.030> priest<00:03:32.359> to<00:03:32.540> the<00:03:32.659> tank<00:03:32.989> and<00:03:33.260> the

00:06:43.199 --> 00:06:43.209 
this is probably likely to change

00:06:43.209 --> 00:06:46.169 
this is probably likely to change
because<00:06:44.309> people<00:06:45.309> aren't<00:06:45.429> too<00:06:45.579> happy<00:06:45.759> about<00:06:45.939> it

00:06:46.169 --> 00:06:46.179 
because people aren't too happy about it

00:06:46.179 --> 00:06:49.219 
because people aren't too happy about it

00:06:49.219 --> 00:06:49.229 
to be honest anyway I know I'm not and

00:06:49.229 --> 00:06:52.679 
to be honest anyway I know I'm not and
even<00:06:50.229> atonement<00:06:51.099> isn't<00:06:51.579> viable<00:06:51.939> anymore<00:06:52.269> just

00:06:52.679 --> 00:06:52.689 
even atonement isn't viable anymore just

00:06:52.689 --> 00:06:55.289
