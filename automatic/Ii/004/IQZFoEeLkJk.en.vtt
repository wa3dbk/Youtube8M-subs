00:00:00.600 --> 00:00:04.980
 good kids we are here again 

00:00:03.150 --> 00:00:07.319
 call of duty ghosts video this time 

00:00:04.980 --> 00:00:10.530
 in another of the maps of the new dlc of 

00:00:07.319 --> 00:00:12.720
 nemesis this time in dynasty that is a 

00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:15.390
 So Chinese town that is pretty cool 

00:00:12.720 --> 00:00:17.730
 it reminds me if to a map that was in the 

00:00:15.390 --> 00:00:19.800
 Call of Duty 5 but hey I think I 

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:21.330
 just cut the streak where then 

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:23.580
 I get the harrier that is the map of 

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:25.530
 this where you can take out and the truth 

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:27.690
 that I did not expect that I would kill so much 

00:00:25.530 --> 00:00:28.440
 I was bloated but something that was not not 

00:00:27.690 --> 00:00:29.850
 normal 

00:00:28.440 --> 00:00:31.860
 there they killed me I say good so what 

00:00:29.850 --> 00:00:33.780
 shot here that looks like a safe area I 

00:00:31.860 --> 00:00:36.390
 hidden here behind the cubes of 

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:37.920
 I say this to see if you do not remove me 

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:40.260
 package I did not know I was going to play 

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:42.059
 neither of that but I say whatever 

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:44.129
 at least they do not take it off to me 

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:45.899
 catch it and it has killed me with two shovels 

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:48.030
 from the window diego, I'm left without 

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:50.339
 package I have seen that is the one that 

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:52.799
 is the nuclear exit and I was just 

00:00:50.339 --> 00:00:55.679
 removing it I have managed to kill him and 

00:00:52.799 --> 00:00:57.749
 catch it and now you will see simply 

00:00:55.679 --> 00:01:00.839
 pull the harrier because if you remember 

00:00:57.749 --> 00:01:03.329
 marked is an area and it was like an attack 

00:01:00.839 --> 00:01:05.519
 and then he was staying at 

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:06.990
 harrier out there but this one just what 

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:09.750
 loose and here is where it gives 

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:11.630
 and start killing there but I think that 

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:14.820
 killed at least ten with him 

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:16.470
 with the hardware is good I did not even know 

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:18.390
 where was I in the magician because I think 

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:20.520
 that was I do not know if the first or the second 

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:21.720
 game played this map in the 

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:25.229
 others and that played a couple of 

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:26.429
 games in each one the truth that this one 

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:29.429
 of the snow of the submarines also 

00:01:26.429 --> 00:01:31.259
 It's pretty cool but it's loading 

00:01:29.429 --> 00:01:33.960
 the truth that I expected something else not 

00:01:31.259 --> 00:01:35.850
 because that map is chaotic 

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:39.149
 you have the corridors that if you control in 

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:41.159
 yes a little from the outside and that for the 

00:01:39.149 --> 00:01:42.840
 edges of the map yes that can be 

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:45.090
 get some streak but if not how you 

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:47.220
 goals through the center is impossible just 

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:49.380
 you make die but good the truth that 

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:50.970
 is not bad the tlc this I have not either 

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:53.330
 taken out many gusts I've seen that in the 

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:55.860
 east map of the snow of the submarines 

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:58.170
 yes, a pretty good streak comes out 

00:01:55.860 --> 00:02:02.580
 see if I can get it out and upload it too 

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:04.799
 today or if not tomorrow because that is like a 

00:02:02.580 --> 00:02:07.229
 studio big foot or something like that 

00:02:04.799 --> 00:02:09.660
 snow I do not know very well what it is 

00:02:07.229 --> 00:02:12.450
 seen something but not 

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:14.730
 I did not know what it was but well you see 

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:16.980
 the map is pretty cool and a few 

00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:19.140
 houses what for what you have if you go towards 

00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:21.150
 one side to the other I did not even know 

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:22.110
 where to move because it's that until I 

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:24.870
 you play at least three or four 

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:27.840
 games and you know where they come from and all that 

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:30.320
 you're super lost gold but good and 

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:33.600
 You see of 12 casualties I think I had when 

00:02:30.320 --> 00:02:36.330
 when started with the harrier and wearing 

00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:39.300
 30 something like that and I'll try to upload 

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:42.150
 then another video of the maps that are left 

00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:45.000
 And if not, I'll upload the other two tomorrow 

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:47.070
 to see if I get a rachita yes beautiful but 

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:49.310
 Well I hope you liked it and even 

00:02:47.070 --> 00:02:49.310
 the next
