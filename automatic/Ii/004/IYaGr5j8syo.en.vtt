00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.210
 hi friends from youtube good this is a 

00:00:03.870 --> 00:00:08.069
 new video tutorial that will deal with 

00:00:06.210 --> 00:00:09.570
 the care and maintenance of 

00:00:08.069 --> 00:00:11.910
 turtles 

00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:18.820
 These are one of the basic tips 

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:23.200
 you should take your turtle let 

00:00:18.820 --> 00:00:25.030
 have the turtle clean if your turtle is 

00:00:23.200 --> 00:00:28.660
 little 

00:00:25.030 --> 00:00:31.510
 and they have a large aquarium - pretty much 

00:00:28.660 --> 00:00:35.980
 as the one we are showing should 

00:00:31.510 --> 00:00:37.720
 change every day or a day and a half 

00:00:35.980 --> 00:00:41.110
 it is important to have a house of the 

00:00:37.720 --> 00:00:43.059
 turtle well because it's here be very 

00:00:41.110 --> 00:00:45.580
 dirty too much your day is again 

00:00:43.059 --> 00:00:47.370
 its closure can cause illness for 

00:00:45.580 --> 00:00:50.070
 your leak in the eyes 

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:53.879
 and other types of diseases that could 

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:56.579
 do too much damage to something else 

00:00:53.879 --> 00:01:03.089
 important advice is feeding 

00:00:56.579 --> 00:01:05.550
 the turtle look how good it is like my 

00:01:03.089 --> 00:01:08.159
 cousin mentioned good feeding 

00:01:05.550 --> 00:01:12.990
 torture is very important to her 

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:15.060
 you do not have to have a true diet but 

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:17.790
 that you have to have healthy food does not 

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:20.120
 we're going to fish those little ones 

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:24.500
 of three pesos the bag 

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:29.500
 but well here I have the food that I 

00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:35.720
 I recommend that you call reptile steak 

00:01:29.500 --> 00:01:39.020
 the s babies and it's for the 

00:01:35.720 --> 00:01:42.560
 neighbors all of them by name the 

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:46.130

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:55.580
 youth water content is 

00:01:49.900 --> 00:01:57.450
 28 grams good look here I'm going to 

00:01:55.580 --> 00:02:00.719
 to show 

00:01:57.450 --> 00:02:03.990
 good dimensions this is your food 

00:02:00.719 --> 00:02:07.220
 of the turtle is more or less like that when 

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:11.069
 here we only throw it into the fish tank 

00:02:07.220 --> 00:02:14.310
 and the turtle is so I do not know what it is 

00:02:11.069 --> 00:02:15.989
 doing but when they give hunger 

00:02:14.310 --> 00:02:20.370
 will eat you should not try to 

00:02:15.989 --> 00:02:22.640
 exceed this is 28 grams is very 

00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:26.040
 bit 

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:30.180
 it's very little food 

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:32.260
 Half of the bag arrives here but 

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:35.230
 I do not know about you 

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:41.260
 I from my profile that I see it is very 

00:02:35.230 --> 00:02:43.170
 girl the good bag only between 

00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:46.650
 nail 

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:48.940
 you have to be demanding between 40 

00:02:46.650 --> 00:02:53.070
 or 50 

00:02:48.940 --> 00:02:53.070
 50 food grannies 

00:02:53.819 --> 00:02:59.670
 is what we should throw in three 

00:02:56.099 --> 00:03:03.599
 meals between one of those and if your 

00:02:59.670 --> 00:03:05.280
 turtle is the truth the truth up 

00:03:03.599 --> 00:03:08.760
 Now it 's my first turtle 

00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:12.090
 first turtle is 

00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:15.319
 in a bag of these we end up with 

00:03:12.090 --> 00:03:15.319
 she in a week 

00:03:18.319 --> 00:03:27.560
 to show costs between 8 and 10 in a 

00:03:23.819 --> 00:03:27.560
 food like this one bigger 

00:03:29.069 --> 00:03:37.270
 and this food as I already mentioned 28 

00:03:35.409 --> 00:03:42.100
 grams 

00:03:37.270 --> 00:03:45.490
 of reptile food for ours 

00:03:42.100 --> 00:03:47.860
 little turtle is not what they sell us 

00:03:45.490 --> 00:03:51.670
 for eight pesos the truth I do not know what 

00:03:47.860 --> 00:03:53.650
 country are seeing us good in ecuador 

00:03:51.670 --> 00:03:56.230
 the truth I do not think that a little gringuito 

00:03:53.650 --> 00:04:00.690
 can speak english that our terms 

00:03:56.230 --> 00:04:04.570
 from the USA but from an area of ​​stress 

00:04:00.690 --> 00:04:07.620
 well in my equator more or less are measured 

00:04:04.570 --> 00:04:13.050
 for dollars also the same as in the USA 

00:04:07.620 --> 00:04:16.780
 a survey between more or less a dollar 

00:04:13.050 --> 00:04:19.480
 this piece of food good in 

00:04:16.780 --> 00:04:24.930
 Argentina I do not know what kind of currency 

00:04:19.480 --> 00:04:24.930
 occupy good too 

00:04:25.700 --> 00:04:32.660
 we went to the third step of care and 

00:04:29.870 --> 00:04:36.440
 maintenance of our zamora turtle 

00:04:32.660 --> 00:04:37.910
 Well, look at the size of the fish tank 

00:04:36.440 --> 00:04:40.070
 of hair 

00:04:37.910 --> 00:04:42.530
 Honduras is very well María 

00:04:40.070 --> 00:04:44.570
 extremely large not seeing is going to 

00:04:42.530 --> 00:04:48.130
 eat in one of these 

00:04:44.570 --> 00:04:51.740
 I would recommend you there as a 90 a strip 

00:04:48.130 --> 00:04:53.570
 something a person bigger works but 

00:04:51.740 --> 00:04:55.910
 which will be bigger 

00:04:53.570 --> 00:04:58.010
 the recommendation here is that there is a 

00:04:55.910 --> 00:05:01.880
 tiny about this size 

00:04:58.010 --> 00:05:04.880
 and thus in extremely common amateur 4 

00:05:01.880 --> 00:05:07.280
 Portuguese mass 

00:05:04.880 --> 00:05:13.610
 so they want to make 5 of 

00:05:07.280 --> 00:05:17.720
 preferences that have that big 

00:05:13.610 --> 00:05:21.020
 well this is good that's all for today 

00:05:17.720 --> 00:05:23.900
