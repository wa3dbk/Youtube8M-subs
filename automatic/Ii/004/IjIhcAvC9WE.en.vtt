mums going back until last week now it

00:02:18.719 --> 00:02:21.199 
mums going back until last week now it
seems<00:02:18.959> that<00:02:19.079> Mojang<00:02:19.620> wasn't<00:02:20.069> happy<00:02:20.430> with<00:02:20.640> his

00:02:21.199 --> 00:02:21.209 
seems that Mojang wasn't happy with his

00:02:21.209 --> 00:02:23.209 
seems that Mojang wasn't happy with his
approach<00:02:21.629> in<00:02:21.959> terms<00:02:22.170> of<00:02:22.379> what<00:02:22.590> he<00:02:22.769> wanted<00:02:23.099> to

00:02:23.209 --> 00:02:23.219 
approach in terms of what he wanted to

00:02:23.219 --> 00:02:25.759 
approach in terms of what he wanted to
do<00:02:23.430> with<00:02:23.609> Minecraft<00:02:24.060> a<00:02:24.180> movie<00:02:24.569> now<00:02:25.200> as<00:02:25.409> it<00:02:25.650> as

do with Minecraft a movie now as it as

do with Minecraft a movie now as it as
its<00:02:26.069> quoted<00:02:26.489> here<00:02:26.790> from<00:02:27.030> a<00:02:27.120> specific<00:02:27.540> website

00:02:27.709 --> 00:02:27.719 
its quoted here from a specific website

00:02:27.719 --> 00:02:29.899 
its quoted here from a specific website
it<00:02:28.140> says<00:02:28.349> we<00:02:28.859> came<00:02:29.129> up<00:02:29.280> with<00:02:29.400> an<00:02:29.549> approach<00:02:29.879> that

00:02:29.899 --> 00:02:29.909 
it says we came up with an approach that

00:02:29.909 --> 00:02:32.149 
it says we came up with an approach that
felt<00:02:30.420> good<00:02:30.599> to<00:02:30.810> us<00:02:30.959> and<00:02:31.260> I<00:02:31.500> discussed<00:02:31.980> it<00:02:32.129> with

00:02:32.149 --> 00:02:32.159 
felt good to us and I discussed it with

00:02:32.159 --> 00:02:34.220 
felt good to us and I discussed it with
Mojang<00:02:32.760> the<00:02:33.329> game<00:02:33.540> makers<00:02:33.900> who<00:02:34.049> make

00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:34.230 
Mojang the game makers who make

00:02:34.230 --> 00:02:36.289 
Mojang the game makers who make
Minecraft<00:02:34.799> and<00:02:35.040> they<00:02:35.459> were<00:02:35.579> like<00:02:35.790> that

00:02:36.289 --> 00:02:36.299 
Minecraft and they were like that

00:02:36.299 --> 00:02:38.569 
Minecraft and they were like that
doesn't<00:02:36.569> sound<00:02:36.870> like<00:02:37.049> what<00:02:37.439> we<00:02:37.560> want<00:02:37.829> if<00:02:38.099> we're

00:02:38.569 --> 00:02:38.579 
doesn't sound like what we want if we're

00:02:38.579 --> 00:02:41.300 
doesn't sound like what we want if we're
going<00:02:38.760> to<00:02:38.879> see<00:02:39.150> a<00:02:39.180> movie<00:02:39.450> get<00:02:40.139> made<00:02:40.290> we<00:02:41.010> don't

00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:41.310 
going to see a movie get made we don't

00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:43.369 
going to see a movie get made we don't
know<00:02:41.489> what<00:02:41.670> we<00:02:41.819> want<00:02:42.060> but<00:02:42.719> that<00:02:42.780> doesn't<00:02:43.230> feel

00:02:43.369 --> 00:02:43.379 
know what we want but that doesn't feel

00:02:43.379 --> 00:02:45.619 
know what we want but that doesn't feel
right<00:02:43.650> so<00:02:43.920> basically<00:02:44.310> Mojang<00:02:44.909> weren't<00:02:45.180> happy

00:02:45.619 --> 00:02:45.629 
right so basically Mojang weren't happy

00:02:45.629 --> 00:02:48.229 
right so basically Mojang weren't happy
with<00:02:45.810> Sean<00:02:46.349> Levi's<00:02:46.709> approach<00:02:47.159> and<00:02:47.970> people

00:02:48.229 --> 00:02:48.239 
with Sean Levi's approach and people

00:02:48.239 --> 00:02:49.699 
with Sean Levi's approach and people
were<00:02:48.329> saying<00:02:48.540> his<00:02:48.750> approach<00:02:49.139> was<00:02:49.379> going<00:02:49.560> to<00:02:49.620> be

00:02:49.699 --> 00:02:49.709 
were saying his approach was going to be

00:02:49.709 --> 00:02:51.619 
were saying his approach was going to be
similar<00:02:50.040> to<00:02:50.069> the<00:02:50.250> Goonies<00:02:50.669> I<00:02:50.849> love<00:02:51.510> the

00:02:51.619 --> 00:02:51.629 
similar to the Goonies I love the

00:02:51.629 --> 00:02:52.490 
similar to the Goonies I love the
Goonies<00:02:51.989> movie

00:02:52.490 --> 00:02:52.500 
Goonies movie

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:54.199 
Goonies movie
it's<00:02:53.069> kind<00:02:53.310> of<00:02:53.400> like<00:02:53.549> a<00:02:53.609> whole<00:02:53.879> bunch<00:02:54.000> of

00:02:54.199 --> 00:02:54.209 
it's kind of like a whole bunch of

00:02:54.209 --> 00:02:56.240 
it's kind of like a whole bunch of
people<00:02:54.599> who<00:02:55.109> are<00:02:55.139> young<00:02:55.739> and<00:02:56.010> they're<00:02:56.129> going

00:02:56.240 --> 00:02:56.250 
people who are young and they're going

00:02:56.250 --> 00:02:58.129 
people who are young and they're going
on<00:02:56.400> a<00:02:56.459> treasure<00:02:56.790> hunt<00:02:56.909> I<00:02:57.239> would<00:02:57.450> imagine<00:02:57.689> it's

00:02:58.129 --> 00:02:58.139 
on a treasure hunt I would imagine it's

00:02:58.139 --> 00:03:00.770 
on a treasure hunt I would imagine it's
gonna<00:02:58.349> be<00:02:58.620> like<00:02:58.919> Steve<00:02:59.909> and<00:02:59.939> Alex<00:03:00.389> and<00:03:00.659> maybe

00:03:00.770 --> 00:03:00.780 
gonna be like Steve and Alex and maybe

00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:02.929 
gonna be like Steve and Alex and maybe
they<00:03:00.959> group<00:03:01.139> up<00:03:01.290> with<00:03:01.319> some<00:03:01.560> new<00:03:01.709> friends<00:03:02.219> but

00:03:02.929 --> 00:03:02.939 
they group up with some new friends but

00:03:02.939 --> 00:03:04.520 
they group up with some new friends but
it<00:03:03.030> seems<00:03:03.209> like<00:03:03.299> Mojang<00:03:03.750> didn't<00:03:04.260> officially

00:03:04.520 --> 00:03:04.530 
it seems like Mojang didn't officially

00:03:04.530 --> 00:03:06.860 
it seems like Mojang didn't officially
like<00:03:04.980> this<00:03:05.250> approach<00:03:05.639> so<00:03:05.969> they<00:03:06.239> said<00:03:06.419> no<00:03:06.629> and

00:03:06.860 --> 00:03:06.870 
like this approach so they said no and

00:03:06.870 --> 00:03:09.080 
like this approach so they said no and
they<00:03:07.379> have<00:03:07.590> a<00:03:07.620> new<00:03:07.950> director<00:03:08.159> now<00:03:08.760> this<00:03:08.909> new

00:03:09.080 --> 00:03:09.090 
they have a new director now this new

00:03:09.090 --> 00:03:13.459 
they have a new director now this new
director<00:03:09.659> is<00:03:10.189> Rob<00:03:11.189> McElhenney<00:03:12.230> however<00:03:13.230> he's

00:03:13.459 --> 00:03:13.469 
director is Rob McElhenney however he's

00:03:13.469 --> 00:03:16.429 
director is Rob McElhenney however he's
not<00:03:13.650> really<00:03:13.799> a<00:03:14.069> mainstream<00:03:15.109> should<00:03:16.109> I<00:03:16.200> say

00:03:16.429 --> 00:03:16.439 
not really a mainstream should I say

00:03:16.439 --> 00:03:18.589 
not really a mainstream should I say
developer<00:03:17.099> or<00:03:17.280> should<00:03:17.400> I<00:03:17.459> say<00:03:17.639> director<00:03:18.269> he's

00:03:18.589 --> 00:03:18.599 
developer or should I say director he's

00:03:18.599 --> 00:03:22.159 
developer or should I say director he's
been<00:03:19.079> known<00:03:19.319> for<00:03:19.620> a<00:03:19.680> few<00:03:19.739> things<00:03:20.159> such<00:03:20.970> as<00:03:21.169> he's

a writer an actor in It's Always Sunny

00:03:24.449 --> 00:03:26.569 
a writer an actor in It's Always Sunny
in<00:03:24.720> Philadelphia<00:03:24.810> I'm<00:03:25.620> guessing<00:03:26.190> this<00:03:26.280> is<00:03:26.340> a

00:03:26.569 --> 00:03:26.579 
in Philadelphia I'm guessing this is a

00:03:26.579 --> 00:03:29.300 
in Philadelphia I'm guessing this is a
popular<00:03:27.090> u.s.<00:03:27.419> show<00:03:27.870> and<00:03:28.169> also<00:03:28.859> known<00:03:29.069> for

00:03:29.300 --> 00:03:29.310 
popular u.s. show and also known for

00:03:29.310 --> 00:03:30.860 
popular u.s. show and also known for

00:03:30.860 --> 00:03:30.870 
something called Dyne DeVito and the

00:03:30.870 --> 00:03:32.330 
something called Dyne DeVito and the
contract<00:03:31.379> so<00:03:31.560> they're<00:03:31.709> the<00:03:31.799> only<00:03:31.889> two<00:03:32.129> things

00:03:32.330 --> 00:03:32.340 
contract so they're the only two things

00:03:32.340 --> 00:03:34.640 
contract so they're the only two things
that<00:03:32.639> he's<00:03:33.120> really<00:03:33.419> known<00:03:33.720> for<00:03:33.750> so<00:03:34.319> I<00:03:34.349> guess

00:03:34.640 --> 00:03:34.650 
that he's really known for so I guess

00:03:34.650 --> 00:03:36.589 
that he's really known for so I guess
this<00:03:34.799> is<00:03:34.949> kind<00:03:35.189> of<00:03:35.220> a<00:03:35.370> big<00:03:35.639> thing<00:03:35.669> for<00:03:36.150> him<00:03:36.299> and

00:03:36.589 --> 00:03:36.599 
this is kind of a big thing for him and

00:03:36.599 --> 00:03:38.629 
this is kind of a big thing for him and
I<00:03:36.989> wonder<00:03:37.319> how<00:03:37.349> his<00:03:37.709> approach<00:03:38.040> on<00:03:38.250> Minecraft

00:03:38.629 --> 00:03:38.639 
I wonder how his approach on Minecraft

00:03:38.639 --> 00:03:40.129 
I wonder how his approach on Minecraft
the<00:03:38.729> movie<00:03:39.000> is<00:03:39.090> gonna<00:03:39.239> be<00:03:39.510> I'm<00:03:39.689> guessing<00:03:40.019> it's

00:03:40.129 --> 00:03:40.139 
the movie is gonna be I'm guessing it's

00:03:40.139 --> 00:03:42.259 
the movie is gonna be I'm guessing it's
gonna<00:03:40.229> be<00:03:40.409> completely<00:03:40.799> different<00:03:40.889> from<00:03:41.729> Shawn

00:03:42.259 --> 00:03:42.269

officially<00:04:07.349> out<00:04:07.470> I<00:04:07.500> think<00:04:07.859> they<00:04:07.949> did<00:04:08.220> say<00:04:08.459> it's

00:04:08.719 --> 00:04:08.729

00:04:08.729 --> 00:04:11.749 
officially out I think they did say it's
coming<00:04:09.120> next<00:04:09.659> year<00:04:09.840> which<00:04:10.139> is<00:04:10.310> 2016<00:04:11.310> I<00:04:11.489> think

00:04:11.749 --> 00:04:11.759 
coming next year which is 2016 I think

00:04:11.759 --> 00:04:14.210 
coming next year which is 2016 I think
towards<00:04:12.209> the<00:04:12.359> end<00:04:12.540> so<00:04:13.259> September<00:04:14.009> October

00:04:14.210 --> 00:04:14.220 
towards the end so September October

00:04:14.220 --> 00:04:16.520 
towards the end so September October
November<00:04:14.549> or<00:04:14.970> December<00:04:15.090> nonetheless<00:04:16.049> I'm

00:04:16.520 --> 00:04:16.530 
November or December nonetheless I'm

00:04:16.530 --> 00:04:18.499 
November or December nonetheless I'm
really<00:04:16.799> interested<00:04:17.099> to<00:04:17.459> see<00:04:17.669> what<00:04:18.090> happens

00:04:18.499 --> 00:04:18.509

00:04:18.509 --> 00:04:19.819 
really interested to see what happens
from<00:04:18.659> here<00:04:18.750> hopefully<00:04:19.380> this<00:04:19.530> is<00:04:19.680> the<00:04:19.709> last

00:04:19.819 --> 00:04:19.829 
from here hopefully this is the last

00:04:19.829 --> 00:04:22.490 
from here hopefully this is the last
direct<00:04:20.609> that<00:04:20.729> they<00:04:20.849> do<00:04:20.909> approach<00:04:21.409> but<00:04:22.409> yeah<00:04:22.469> I

00:04:22.490 --> 00:04:22.500 
direct that they do approach but yeah I

00:04:22.500 --> 00:04:25.040 
direct that they do approach but yeah I
think<00:04:22.650> the<00:04:23.039> goony<00:04:23.340> styled

00:04:25.040 --> 00:04:25.050 
think the goony styled

00:04:25.050 --> 00:04:26.870 
think the goony styled
approach<00:04:25.500> from<00:04:25.740> Shaun<00:04:25.979> Levi<00:04:26.310> was<00:04:26.520> a<00:04:26.550> great

00:04:26.870 --> 00:04:26.880 
approach from Shaun Levi was a great

00:04:26.880 --> 00:04:28.159 
approach from Shaun Levi was a great
pitch<00:04:27.120> I<00:04:27.360> thought<00:04:27.539> that<00:04:27.690> would<00:04:27.840> have<00:04:27.870> been<00:04:28.050> an

00:04:28.159 --> 00:04:28.169 
pitch I thought that would have been an

00:04:28.169 --> 00:04:30.200 
pitch I thought that would have been an
awesome<00:04:28.500> movie<00:04:28.830> so<00:04:29.039> I<00:04:29.280> don't<00:04:29.699> know<00:04:29.789> how<00:04:30.030> much
