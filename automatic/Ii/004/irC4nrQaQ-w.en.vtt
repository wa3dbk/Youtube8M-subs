00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:17.220 
him in the final and I'm sure we you

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:18.890 
him in the final and I'm sure we you
know<00:01:17.340> I'd<00:01:17.640> love<00:01:17.880> to<00:01:18.030> have<00:01:18.150> that<00:01:18.330> batter<00:01:18.570> once

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:18.900 
know I'd love to have that batter once

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:21.469 
know I'd love to have that batter once
at<00:01:19.259> least<00:01:19.290> and<00:01:19.770> I<00:01:20.549> think<00:01:20.909> there's<00:01:21.060> not<00:01:21.240> enough

00:01:21.469 --> 00:01:21.479 
at least and I think there's not enough

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:23.359 
at least and I think there's not enough
words<00:01:21.689> that<00:01:21.869> we<00:01:21.960> can<00:01:22.140> actually<00:01:22.619> describe<00:01:23.189> him

00:01:23.359 --> 00:01:23.369 
words that we can actually describe him

00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:26.390 
words that we can actually describe him
a<00:01:23.750> slightly<00:01:24.750> less<00:01:25.080> intense<00:01:25.560> playing<00:01:25.920> schedule

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:26.400 
a slightly less intense playing schedule

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:27.499 
a slightly less intense playing schedule
for<00:01:26.580> 2013

00:01:27.499 --> 00:01:27.509 
for 2013

00:01:27.509 --> 00:01:29.450 
for 2013
might<00:01:27.960> be<00:01:28.170> seen<00:01:28.409> as<00:01:28.439> a<00:01:28.590> sign<00:01:28.860> of<00:01:28.890> slowing<00:01:29.159> down

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:29.460 
might be seen as a sign of slowing down

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:32.030 
might be seen as a sign of slowing down
for<00:01:29.670> the<00:01:29.970> great<00:01:30.210> man<00:01:30.479> but<00:01:31.140> Federer<00:01:31.590> has<00:01:31.740> always

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:32.040 
for the great man but Federer has always

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:35.749 
for the great man but Federer has always
enjoyed<00:01:32.460> proving<00:01:33.180> his<00:01:33.299> critics<00:01:33.750> wrong<00:01:34.729> yeah<00:01:35.729> I
