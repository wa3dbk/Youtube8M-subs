00:00:04.839 --> 00:00:05.519
 What are you waiting for dooshbag? 

00:00:05.519 --> 00:00:09.840
 That guy just stood there. Go and lick his ass! 

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:13.269
 Hi YouTube user is Charlie because I am planning to make a bunch of video sticks 

00:00:13.269 --> 00:00:17.150
 The truth, I want to make a game preview in depth of field, give you an idea of ​​what it is. 

00:00:17.150 --> 00:00:19.840
 What will these be like? a lot of things, I will do it just depends on you 

00:00:19.840 --> 00:00:22.520
 You want to see, so be sure to tell me what you want. I also give two 

00:00:22.520 --> 00:00:23.890
 20 yuan digital steam gift card. 

00:00:23.890 --> 00:00:28.020
 For the gift card all you need to do is a user leaving this video message, 

00:00:28.020 --> 00:00:30.039
 I will choose two people randomly and announce the winners next week. 

00:00:30.039 --> 00:00:33.780
 On the fun stuff, this video will go straight up with the details of the game preview 

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:37.840
 And the mechanism on the background. Next video I will start early review 

00:00:37.840 --> 00:00:43.860
 One day March 7. This will be in 360, PS3 and PC. I will play PC version. 

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:46.170
 Just because it's easier to do game capture. 

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:49.420
 After that I will do let's play a mix of videos with other reviews or 20% 

00:00:49.420 --> 00:00:53.920
 I plowed through the game. I can also do the exercises if you want. In the past, I have not 

00:00:53.920 --> 00:00:58.360
 The thing to do games is just because my real life job is full time, I like to sleep. 

00:00:58.360 --> 00:01:01.550
 But if I am always pulling all the time, I have to do something, whether it is 

00:01:01.550 --> 00:01:06.570
 It’s really fun to be really important. I know the truth of the stick will be at least a ton of fun. 

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:10.609
 The important thing to note: If you are a British player playing this console version, 

00:01:10.609 --> 00:01:16.009
 You will have a different version of the game. It got reviewed and about 7 cut scenes 

00:01:16.009 --> 00:01:21.289
 Each was cut off for 20 seconds each. The account is extremely fascinating. So all you have to 

00:01:21.289 --> 00:01:26.060
 Do, if the uncensored version you want is a PC version purchased through steam or elsewhere. 

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:29.529
 The game itself is a real 50 hours plus the Changnan Park plot retreats second. 

00:01:29.529 --> 00:01:32.409
 So I think even if you are not a gamer like, but you love the South Park game is worth it 

00:01:32.409 --> 00:01:32.709
 Buy the plate. 

00:01:32.709 --> 00:01:36.509
 Just take a look at the list of Xbox achievements. Obviously most if not all of these will be launched 

00:01:36.509 --> 00:01:37.659
 Transfer to other platforms. 

00:01:37.659 --> 00:01:43.990
 Join the KKK and let the ginger bite you 3 times without blocking, you throw the created feces 

00:01:43.990 --> 00:01:49.770
 Enemies in battle. The list will get crazy. Scared to be stupid in the battle three times. 

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:51.719
 This is a big stern. 

00:01:51.719 --> 00:01:55.939
 Visual appearance and mechanics are very good. Looks like a lot of fans for Nintendo 

00:01:55.939 --> 00:02:01.249
 Like paper Mario and every South Park reference you can think of. This story does have 

00:02:01.249 --> 00:02:06.119
 A loose narrative and battle completes JRPG's turn-based style, but like most western 

00:02:06.119 --> 00:02:10.399
 The achievements and tasks of RPG games are based on exploration, so you can do a lot 

00:02:10.399 --> 00:02:11.900
 Competition rules. 

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:16.019
 If you've played World of Warcraft or any RAID-based online game then you will have an easier time with 

00:02:16.019 --> 00:02:20.540
 battle. There is a strategic element to defeat the group and you must call 

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:25.700
 For DPS-based classes, such as the Master can use the melee NPC to deal with. 

00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:32.700
 The actual playable classes are thieves, warriors, mages and Jews. The death mechanism is true 

00:02:34.019 --> 00:02:38.209
 Funny. If you go to heaven, you are like a group of Mormons. 

00:02:38.209 --> 00:02:43.019
 And your level of NPC becomes more interesting. Like in the end you will find your own battle 

00:02:43.019 --> 00:02:46.879
 The Mongols will go on horseback. 

00:02:46.879 --> 00:02:50.579
 Some attack bonuses and damage bonuses, what you can get is quite interesting too much like protection 

00:02:50.579 --> 00:02:51.189
 My ball. 

00:02:51.189 --> 00:02:56.560
 I have always focused on RPG games, mostly JRPG games, but I am a big South Park. 

00:02:56.560 --> 00:03:00.909
 Fans, I can't think of a better way to waste my life and have fun at the same time. 

00:03:00.909 --> 00:03:04.499
 If you have seen any faults or Easter egg videos I did, I might include some 

00:03:04.499 --> 00:03:08.549
 Something is in the walkthrough video. Most of me just looking forward to putting my own inside 

00:03:08.549 --> 00:03:12.829
 50 hours plus South Park plot. 50 hours is a benchmark for most RPG games 

00:03:12.829 --> 00:03:17.650
 Like the sky, if you only play the main story and mandatory tasks. If you do all the side 

00:03:17.650 --> 00:03:22.430
 The task I am sure, you can stretch the truth until the person who insists on 120 hours or more thinks 

00:03:22.430 --> 00:03:25.620
 Like to achieve prostitutes. 

00:03:25.620 --> 00:03:32.560
 I won't start playing until the day of the launch, but my Steam community profile is emergencyawesome. 

00:03:32.560 --> 00:03:36.299
 Be sure to let me know what kind of game video you want. Including the drill, let us 

00:03:36.299 --> 00:03:38.689
 Play and comment. 

00:03:38.689 --> 00:03:41.920
