hello YouTube in this video we're going
to<00:00:07.180> look<00:00:07.359> at<00:00:07.540> a<00:00:07.750> technique<00:00:08.440> called<00:00:08.469> harmonize

00:00:09.390 --> 00:00:09.400 
to look at a technique called harmonize

to look at a technique called harmonize
in<00:00:09.700> the<00:00:09.790> major<00:00:10.000> scale<00:00:10.330> and<00:00:11.320> what<00:00:11.500> we're<00:00:11.889> going

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:11.920 
in the major scale and what we're going

00:00:11.920 --> 00:00:13.440 
in the major scale and what we're going
to<00:00:12.099> do<00:00:12.250> we're<00:00:12.429> going<00:00:12.580> to<00:00:12.639> put<00:00:12.820> out<00:00:13.000> seven

to do we're going to put out seven

00:00:13.450 --> 00:00:15.780 
to do we're going to put out seven
really<00:00:13.929> nice<00:00:14.139> arpeggios<00:00:15.009> from<00:00:15.490> the<00:00:15.580> major

dominant 7-7 the a half diminish
sometimes<00:01:08.500> called<00:01:08.800> minor<00:01:09.070> 7<00:01:09.550> flat<00:01:09.730> 5<00:01:13.980> and

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:14.980 
sometimes called minor 7 flat 5 and

00:01:14.980 --> 00:01:23.460 
sometimes called minor 7 flat 5 and
we're<00:01:15.160> back<00:01:15.310> where<00:01:15.550> we<00:01:15.580> started<00:01:15.730> on

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:23.470 

00:01:23.470 --> 00:01:26.410 

now<00:01:24.470> the<00:01:24.530> theory<00:01:25.160> behind<00:01:25.370> finding<00:01:26.240> these

00:01:26.410 --> 00:01:26.420 
now the theory behind finding these

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:29.260 
now the theory behind finding these
arpeggios<00:01:26.840> is<00:01:27.380> extremely<00:01:28.130> simple<00:01:28.610> and<00:01:28.760> that's

00:01:29.260 --> 00:01:29.270 
arpeggios is extremely simple and that's

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:31.390 
arpeggios is extremely simple and that's
what<00:01:29.450> I'm<00:01:29.540> machine<00:01:29.840> X<00:01:30.140> so<00:01:30.950> what<00:01:31.130> we're<00:01:31.280> going

00:01:31.390 --> 00:01:31.400 
what I'm machine X so what we're going

00:01:31.400 --> 00:01:33.810 
what I'm machine X so what we're going
to<00:01:31.520> do<00:01:31.670> we're<00:01:31.850> going<00:01:32.030> to<00:01:32.120> take<00:01:32.270> the<00:01:32.420> scale<00:01:32.720> of<00:01:32.750> C

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:33.820 
to do we're going to take the scale of C

00:01:33.820 --> 00:01:51.340 
to do we're going to take the scale of C
c<00:01:34.820> d<00:01:35.780> e<00:01:36.460> f<00:01:37.750> g<00:01:38.920> a<00:01:39.970> b<00:01:41.080> c<00:01:43.390> will<00:01:44.390> do<00:01:44.540> two<00:01:44.750> octaves<00:01:50.350> like

00:01:51.340 --> 00:01:51.350 
c d e f g a b c will do two octaves like

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:53.890 
c d e f g a b c will do two octaves like
so<00:01:51.910> then<00:01:52.910> we're<00:01:53.090> going<00:01:53.210> to<00:01:53.300> look<00:01:53.360> at<00:01:53.480> the<00:01:53.630> first

00:01:53.890 --> 00:01:53.900 
so then we're going to look at the first

00:01:53.900 --> 00:01:57.760 
so then we're going to look at the first
note<00:01:54.430> the<00:01:55.430> third<00:01:55.820> note<00:01:56.210> the<00:01:56.780> fifth<00:01:57.140> note<00:01:57.440> on

00:01:57.760 --> 00:01:57.770 
note the third note the fifth note on

00:01:57.770 --> 00:02:01.960 
note the third note the fifth note on
the<00:01:58.640> 7th<00:01:59.030> note<00:01:59.710> so<00:02:00.710> we've<00:02:00.860> got<00:02:01.310> the<00:02:01.400> first<00:02:01.670> note

00:02:01.960 --> 00:02:01.970 
the 7th note so we've got the first note

00:02:01.970 --> 00:02:04.840 
the 7th note so we've got the first note
and<00:02:02.240> we've<00:02:02.390> skipped<00:02:02.690> every<00:02:03.140> other<00:02:03.350> note<00:02:03.800> if<00:02:04.700> we

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:04.850 
and we've skipped every other note if we

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:10.990 
and we've skipped every other note if we
pull<00:02:05.090> these<00:02:05.270> notes<00:02:05.630> out<00:02:06.010> see<00:02:07.360> e.g<00:02:09.130> be<00:02:10.130> we<00:02:10.820> get

00:02:10.990 --> 00:02:11.000 
pull these notes out see e.g be we get

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:15.450 
pull these notes out see e.g be we get
in<00:02:11.120> our<00:02:11.210> page<00:02:11.450> 0<00:02:11.630> an<00:02:11.870> accord<00:02:12.290> called<00:02:12.830> c<00:02:13.960> major

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:15.460 
in our page 0 an accord called c major

00:02:15.460 --> 00:02:19.750 
in our page 0 an accord called c major
sin<00:02:17.590> now<00:02:18.590> we're<00:02:18.770> going<00:02:18.890> to<00:02:18.950> go<00:02:19.010> to<00:02:19.130> the<00:02:19.370> second

00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:19.760 
sin now we're going to go to the second

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:24.060 
sin now we're going to go to the second
note<00:02:19.970> the<00:02:20.150> d<00:02:20.420> and<00:02:20.750> pull<00:02:21.350> out<00:02:21.500> every<00:02:21.800> other<00:02:22.700> note

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:24.070 
note the d and pull out every other note

00:02:24.070 --> 00:02:33.330 
note the d and pull out every other note
so<00:02:25.070> we<00:02:25.220> get<00:02:25.430> d<00:02:25.989> f<00:02:26.989> a<00:02:29.080> see<00:02:30.520> this<00:02:31.520> gives<00:02:31.850> us<00:02:32.120> the

00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:33.340 
so we get d f a see this gives us the

00:02:33.340 --> 00:02:38.410 
so we get d f a see this gives us the
minor<00:02:34.510> 7<00:02:35.510> arpeggio<00:02:35.989> or<00:02:36.380> cord<00:02:37.060> now<00:02:38.060> we'll<00:02:38.209> go<00:02:38.239> to

00:02:38.410 --> 00:02:38.420 
minor 7 arpeggio or cord now we'll go to

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:43.030 
minor 7 arpeggio or cord now we'll go to
the<00:02:38.540> e<00:02:38.660> note<00:02:38.840> and<00:02:39.470> we'll<00:02:40.010> pull<00:02:40.190> out<00:02:40.340> e<00:02:40.959> g<00:02:41.959> b<00:02:42.739> and

Olivia<00:04:36.680> see<00:04:37.680> major<00:04:37.860> snow<00:04:40.640> the<00:04:41.640> thing<00:04:41.850> to<00:04:41.970> do

00:04:42.140 --> 00:04:42.150 
Olivia see major snow the thing to do

00:04:42.150 --> 00:04:44.210 
Olivia see major snow the thing to do
now<00:04:42.180> is<00:04:42.390> we're<00:04:42.840> going<00:04:42.990> to<00:04:43.050> use<00:04:43.290> them<00:04:43.530> in<00:04:43.800> a

00:04:44.210 --> 00:04:44.220 
now is we're going to use them in a

00:04:44.220 --> 00:04:47.710 
now is we're going to use them in a
famous<00:04:44.730> type<00:04:45.150> of<00:04:45.390> progression<00:04:46.110> called<00:04:46.890> a<00:04:47.010> 251

00:04:47.710 --> 00:04:47.720 
famous type of progression called a 251

00:04:47.720 --> 00:04:50.900 
famous type of progression called a 251
progression<00:04:48.720> and<00:04:49.280> if<00:04:50.280> you<00:04:50.370> think<00:04:50.400> of<00:04:50.790> the

00:04:50.900 --> 00:04:50.910 
progression and if you think of the

00:04:50.910 --> 00:04:54.790 
progression and if you think of the
first<00:04:51.120> scale<00:04:51.570> the<00:04:51.810> major<00:04:52.020> certain<00:04:52.530> see<00:04:53.600> one

00:04:54.790 --> 00:04:54.800 
first scale the major certain see one

00:04:54.800 --> 00:05:00.830 
first scale the major certain see one
the<00:04:55.800> two<00:04:56.100> is<00:04:56.280> the<00:04:56.430> theme<00:04:56.640> einer<00:04:59.030> the<00:05:00.030> five<00:05:00.360> we

00:05:00.830 --> 00:05:00.840 
the two is the theme einer the five we

00:05:00.840 --> 00:05:06.470 
the two is the theme einer the five we
the<00:05:00.990> fifth<00:05:01.200> note<00:05:01.410> the<00:05:01.620> g<00:05:01.890> and<00:05:04.160> the<00:05:05.160> one<00:05:06.150> is<00:05:06.330> the

00:05:06.470 --> 00:05:06.480 
the fifth note the g and the one is the

00:05:06.480 --> 00:05:11.390 
the fifth note the g and the one is the

00:05:11.390 --> 00:05:11.400 
first note the c major seven so if we

00:05:11.400 --> 00:05:13.340 
first note the c major seven so if we
put<00:05:11.610> this<00:05:11.730> all<00:05:11.940> together<00:05:12.120> with<00:05:12.570> our<00:05:12.600> our<00:05:12.870> pjs

00:05:13.340 --> 00:05:13.350 
put this all together with our our pjs

00:05:13.350 --> 00:05:21.440 
put this all together with our our pjs
we<00:05:14.070> get<00:05:14.280> d<00:05:14.520> minor<00:05:15.020> 7<00:05:19.610> and<00:05:20.610> then<00:05:20.880> we<00:05:21.030> get<00:05:21.240> our

00:05:21.440 --> 00:05:21.450 
we get d minor 7 and then we get our

00:05:21.450 --> 00:05:29.390 
we get d minor 7 and then we get our
dominant<00:05:22.080> g7<00:05:26.750> and<00:05:27.750> then<00:05:28.350> this<00:05:28.710> will<00:05:28.980> resolve

00:05:29.390 --> 00:05:29.400 
dominant g7 and then this will resolve

00:05:29.400 --> 00:05:37.570 
dominant g7 and then this will resolve
to<00:05:29.910> see<00:05:30.420> me

00:05:37.570 --> 00:05:37.580 

00:05:37.580 --> 00:05:39.969 

I<00:05:37.639> mean<00:05:38.030> if<00:05:38.300> we<00:05:38.479> flattened<00:05:38.960> sudden<00:05:39.439> we<00:05:39.680> can<00:05:39.830> get

00:05:39.969 --> 00:05:39.979 
I mean if we flattened sudden we can get

00:05:39.979 --> 00:05:48.159 
I mean if we flattened sudden we can get
a<00:05:40.009> nice<00:05:40.159> turnaround<00:05:45.939> so<00:05:46.939> just<00:05:47.300> our<00:05:47.479> pjs<00:05:47.930> we

00:05:48.159 --> 00:05:48.169 
a nice turnaround so just our pjs we

00:05:48.169 --> 00:05:57.309 
a nice turnaround so just our pjs we
will<00:05:48.259> be<00:05:48.439> minus<00:05:48.710> a<00:05:51.939> she<00:05:52.939> done<00:05:56.169> and<00:05:57.169> the

00:05:57.309 --> 00:05:57.319 
will be minus a she done and the

00:05:57.319 --> 00:06:03.129 
will be minus a she done and the
resulting<00:06:00.819> c7<00:06:01.819> c<00:06:02.000> major<00:06:02.210> seven<00:06:02.509> and<00:06:02.840> an<00:06:03.020> all

00:06:03.129 --> 00:06:03.139 
resulting c7 c major seven and an all

00:06:03.139 --> 00:06:08.290 
resulting c7 c major seven and an all
tomorrow<00:06:06.009> and<00:06:07.009> what<00:06:07.340> you<00:06:07.430> can<00:06:07.669> do<00:06:07.879> all<00:06:08.120> the

00:06:08.290 --> 00:06:08.300 
tomorrow and what you can do all the

00:06:08.300 --> 00:06:13.270 
tomorrow and what you can do all the
while<00:06:08.479> is<00:06:08.750> mixing<00:06:09.259> the<00:06:09.469> major<00:06:09.680> scale<00:06:12.219> so<00:06:13.219> you

00:06:13.270 --> 00:06:13.280 
while is mixing the major scale so you

00:06:13.280 --> 00:06:29.730 
while is mixing the major scale so you
get<00:06:13.550> the<00:06:13.669> d-<00:06:14.030> of<00:06:14.389> knowledge<00:06:14.719> a<00:06:21.729> VG<00:06:22.729> dominance

00:06:29.730 --> 00:06:29.740 

00:06:29.740 --> 00:06:38.709 

and<00:06:30.740> they<00:06:31.279> see<00:06:31.639> my<00:06:31.819> December<00:06:37.180> and<00:06:38.180> then<00:06:38.539> we've

00:06:38.709 --> 00:06:38.719 
and they see my December and then we've

00:06:38.719 --> 00:06:43.990 
and they see my December and then we've
got<00:06:38.750> our<00:06:39.289> c7<00:06:40.120> arpeggiate<00:06:41.120> on<00:06:41.300> sending<00:06:43.000> and

00:06:43.990 --> 00:06:44.000 
got our c7 arpeggiate on sending and

00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:45.760 
got our c7 arpeggiate on sending and
here<00:06:44.330> we<00:06:44.449> can<00:06:44.569> mix<00:06:44.719> in<00:06:44.960> the<00:06:45.080> midst<00:06:45.229> of<00:06:45.409> liliane

00:06:45.760 --> 00:06:45.770 
here we can mix in the midst of liliane

00:06:45.770 --> 00:06:53.920 
here we can mix in the midst of liliane
logan<00:06:45.800> 6<00:06:51.490> so<00:06:52.490> that's<00:06:52.699> one<00:06:53.029> use<00:06:53.389> of<00:06:53.659> these

00:06:53.920 --> 00:06:53.930 
logan 6 so that's one use of these

00:06:53.930 --> 00:06:57.249
