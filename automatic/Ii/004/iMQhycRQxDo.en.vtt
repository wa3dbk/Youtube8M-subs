00:05:51.599 --> 00:05:54.109 
throttles ever so delicate on it though
it's<00:05:52.409> a<00:05:52.740> little<00:05:53.009> bit<00:05:53.189> less<00:05:53.460> forgiving<00:05:53.999> than

00:05:54.109 --> 00:05:54.119 
it's a little bit less forgiving than

00:05:54.119 --> 00:05:57.980 
it's a little bit less forgiving than
the<00:05:54.300> er5<00:05:54.929> twins<00:05:55.909> because<00:05:56.909> being<00:05:57.179> a<00:05:57.300> 4-cylinder

00:05:57.980 --> 00:05:57.990 
the er5 twins because being a 4-cylinder

00:05:57.990 --> 00:05:59.689 
the er5 twins because being a 4-cylinder
the<00:05:58.110> powers<00:05:58.439> a<00:05:58.469> little<00:05:58.679> bit<00:05:58.860> more<00:05:59.159> instantly

00:05:59.689 --> 00:05:59.699 
the powers a little bit more instantly

00:05:59.699 --> 00:06:08.270 
the powers a little bit more instantly
there

00:06:08.270 --> 00:06:08.280 

00:06:08.280 --> 00:06:10.920 

you<00:06:09.280> still<00:06:09.520> get<00:06:09.669> your<00:06:09.699> engine<00:06:09.910> braking<00:06:10.330> but

00:06:10.920 --> 00:06:10.930 
you still get your engine braking but

00:06:10.930 --> 00:06:12.390 
you still get your engine braking but
not<00:06:11.169> quite<00:06:11.470> as<00:06:11.620> much<00:06:11.740> as<00:06:11.889> you<00:06:11.980> would<00:06:12.160> with<00:06:12.370> a

00:06:12.390 --> 00:06:12.400 
not quite as much as you would with a

00:06:12.400 --> 00:06:15.659 
not quite as much as you would with a
twin<00:06:13.470> but<00:06:14.470> you<00:06:14.650> just<00:06:15.040> got<00:06:15.250> a<00:06:15.280> hold<00:06:15.520> that

00:06:15.659 --> 00:06:15.669 
twin but you just got a hold that

00:06:15.669 --> 00:06:18.230 
twin but you just got a hold that
throttle<00:06:15.940> so<00:06:16.510> steadily<00:06:17.050> for<00:06:17.530> it<00:06:17.590> to<00:06:17.680> be<00:06:17.800> smooth

00:06:18.230 --> 00:06:18.240 
throttle so steadily for it to be smooth

00:06:18.240 --> 00:06:21.080 
throttle so steadily for it to be smooth
so<00:06:19.240> it's<00:06:19.389> not<00:06:19.479> as<00:06:19.600> easy<00:06:19.810> to<00:06:19.990> ride<00:06:20.290> as<00:06:20.410> in<00:06:20.500> the<00:06:20.590> r5

00:06:21.080 --> 00:06:21.090 
so it's not as easy to ride as in the r5

00:06:21.090 --> 00:06:23.100 
so it's not as easy to ride as in the r5
but<00:06:22.090> I<00:06:22.150> can<00:06:22.300> imagine<00:06:22.389> this<00:06:22.720> being<00:06:22.870> more

00:06:23.100 --> 00:06:23.110 
but I can imagine this being more

00:06:23.110 --> 00:06:25.590 
but I can imagine this being more
rewarding
