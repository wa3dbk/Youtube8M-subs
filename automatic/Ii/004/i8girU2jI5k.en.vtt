 bucket what a bukit server is for 

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:27.720
 good guys a bukit server serves 

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:31.250
 to add plugins and plugins 

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:35.250
 they serve to have a little more control 

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:37.530
 it serves for millions things to see put 

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:42.120
 an established spam where you want 

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:45.270
 to create groups good infinities of 

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:47.760
 plugins but let's also see the 

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:50.519
 most essential plugins the basics that 

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:52.500
 you need a server so you can 

00:00:50.519 --> 00:00:54.329
 work fine ok guys we are going to 

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:56.670
 start and as I say in each tutorial 

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:58.620
 to follow each step so that you do not 

00:00:56.670 --> 00:01:01.079
 lose in nothing and so can not do 

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:03.059
 something more perfect guys abajito I'll leave 

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:06.000
 the link of this page 

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:07.110
 from here and the craft will be unloaded 

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:13.180
 bukit in the 

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:15.310
 1.3 point 1 r 0.1 clear and that this 

00:01:13.180 --> 00:01:17.799
 here is only a beta we download it 

00:01:15.310 --> 00:01:20.320
 we click here and it will be downloaded 

00:01:17.799 --> 00:01:21.640
 good as I have it done we are going to 

00:01:20.320 --> 00:01:24.729
 download we'll see what 

00:01:21.640 --> 00:01:27.220
 download and ready download and everything 

00:01:24.729 --> 00:01:29.590
 that perfect point as I have it here 

00:01:27.220 --> 00:01:33.509
 it's going to come out like that, you're going to change it 

00:01:29.590 --> 00:01:37.030
 name you copy and create a folder 

00:01:33.509 --> 00:01:39.580
 anyone at the desk wherever 

00:01:37.030 --> 00:01:42.130
 we put here and you're going to hit it here 

00:01:39.580 --> 00:01:43.630
 you hit and you're going to change the name to 

00:01:42.130 --> 00:01:46.090
 that is not so long because it looks 

00:01:43.630 --> 00:01:48.399
 unsightly so we put him 

00:01:46.090 --> 00:01:52.539
 we removed all this and we left it so 

00:01:48.399 --> 00:01:54.909
 the bookies a perfect 13.1 and if you 

00:01:52.539 --> 00:01:58.070
 will agree in the previous video how 

00:01:54.909 --> 00:02:01.340
 created how to create a normal server 

00:01:58.070 --> 00:02:05.330
 from minecraft we enter here to a pad of 

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:07.250
 notes and we copy this perfect file and 

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:11.500
 This name has appeared here 

00:02:07.250 --> 00:02:15.650
 we copy here perfect we stop 

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:18.350
 also look for them script 1.3 point 

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:21.110
 1 and the point of view because it is a file 

00:02:18.350 --> 00:02:23.480
 llar perfect we keep it this is a 

00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:28.070
 important cos the little ass not the 

00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:30.230
 little ass not the little point bat always 

00:02:28.070 --> 00:02:32.600
 has to end in bat but function 

00:02:30.230 --> 00:02:34.100
 If it's not like that, it's not going to work for you and 

00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:36.290
 will start the server what 

00:02:34.100 --> 00:02:38.810
 we keep replacing it because what 

00:02:36.290 --> 00:02:41.310
 we have and perfect we know this now you 

00:02:38.810 --> 00:02:44.550
 let's click here 

00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:47.010
 and they are going to generate what is the world 

00:02:44.550 --> 00:02:49.670
 but before that, all the 

00:02:47.010 --> 00:02:52.290
 world we are going to download the plugins 

00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:55.380
 simple basic basics like the 

00:02:52.290 --> 00:02:57.840
 name says it and we click here 

00:02:55.380 --> 00:02:59.550
 download essence to the core and that 

00:02:57.840 --> 00:03:02.960
 download this 

00:02:59.550 --> 00:03:05.960
 perfect we give click here 

00:03:02.960 --> 00:03:09.110
 and we copy these clubs in these files 

00:03:05.960 --> 00:03:10.640
 and folders plugins this folder plugins 

00:03:09.110 --> 00:03:15.020
 that was generated 

00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:16.970
 we drag it perfect now we put the 

00:03:15.020 --> 00:03:18.500
 home that is to reload the map and 

00:03:16.970 --> 00:03:21.470
 so that the plugins generate the 

00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:26.140
 folders and normal files robots 

00:03:21.470 --> 00:03:28.520
 and ready , everything is loaded now 

00:03:26.140 --> 00:03:30.320
 how are we going to do perfect 

00:03:28.520 --> 00:03:31.610
 we closed this so that people would 

00:03:30.320 --> 00:03:33.709
 goal because our friends get into 

00:03:31.610 --> 00:03:36.110
 you have to have hamas and good if you do not 

00:03:33.709 --> 00:03:37.940
 you have hamachi and if you can open it 

00:03:36.110 --> 00:03:40.280
 which is the ports so they can 

00:03:37.940 --> 00:03:42.709
 enter without ever and that is something else 

00:03:40.280 --> 00:03:44.420
 of our subject that I should not put in like this 

00:03:42.709 --> 00:03:47.930
 which then is old machito and create a 

00:03:44.420 --> 00:03:50.600
 perfect network and will copy what is 

00:03:47.930 --> 00:03:53.780
 here this is copied here and you are going to enter 

00:03:50.600 --> 00:03:56.209
 to the server file ok the server server and 

00:03:53.780 --> 00:03:59.330
 Properties files ok and we will 

00:03:56.209 --> 00:04:02.450
 copy here to serve the pegs here the 

00:03:59.330 --> 00:04:05.150
 you keep now as I always say 

00:04:02.450 --> 00:04:08.630
 you must change to false here so that 

00:04:05.150 --> 00:04:10.519
 people can get no premium and people 

00:04:08.630 --> 00:04:11.900
 premium if you put it in only going to 

00:04:10.519 --> 00:04:15.140

00:04:15.140 --> 00:04:19.070
 here what few topics that we will see see 

00:04:17.479 --> 00:04:24.590
