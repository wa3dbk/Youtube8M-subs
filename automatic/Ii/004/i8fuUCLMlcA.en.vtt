00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:17.640
 my dirty little helpers now , too 

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:19.500
 quite often he did what he wanted 

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:20.880
 for things and now I wanted 

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:22.650
 also show you a little bit 

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:24.660
 that I have so many little helpers 

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:25.980
 always have it with you and with 

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:27.420
 which things do not work where 

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:29.400
 I also have really good experiences 

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:30.539
 did that and I'd begun to 

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:32.340
 man i have my first little ones 

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:35.070
 helpers are in this great case here 

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:36.750
 and then the following things in it 

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:40.290
 Of course, for the time being, we'll start 

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:41.370
 fundamental to when you build it is 

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:43.200
 I actually always very important 

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:46.530
 I have gloves for example 

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:48.210
 where you are almost on where two fingers open 

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:50.850
 are ie you can also just what 

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:52.739
 grab and injure your hands 

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:54.270
 not if you somehow something stuck 

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:55.949
 or the child that was being pinched 

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:57.210
 so that's a good thing and 

00:00:55.949 --> 00:00:58.469
 I've always had that 

00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:00.030
 Pretty good experience with made before 

00:00:58.469 --> 00:01:02.160
 especially if you are really good with 

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:04.260
 of course, then the traverse can grab 

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:07.439
 Together, the copper hammer 500 blocks 

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:09.150

00:01:07.439 --> 00:01:11.520
 quite cheap price and I have 

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:13.350

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:30.479
