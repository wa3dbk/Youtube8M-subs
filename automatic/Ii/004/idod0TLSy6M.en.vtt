00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:09.600

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:15.210
 in a pharmacy and well there 's the 

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:17.850

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:19.500
 good oil in this case of bone 

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:22.230

00:01:22.230 --> 00:01:27.360
 guarantee that there you will find it and 

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:28.830
 is 100% effective because first of all 

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:32.190
 cocoa nobody is going to help us 

00:01:28.830 --> 00:01:34.890
 strengthen the hair root 

00:01:32.190 --> 00:01:37.890
 in the classes he remembers that I 

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:40.470
 I usually mix the oils on 

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:42.300
 today we will not do so we will 

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:44.550
 to do a very special routine 

00:01:42.300 --> 00:01:47.010
 precisely to strengthen but also 

00:01:44.550 --> 00:01:49.950
 give silkiness and seal those 

00:01:47.010 --> 00:01:51.270
 tips that we have to do first 

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:53.490
 well you know that always 

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:54.750
 I recommend your great brushing with this 

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:57.479
 special brush that you already 

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:58.920
 you know what I'm going to turn around like this 

00:01:57.479 --> 00:02:01.290
 brush I do not know we love it because 

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:03.270
 remember that you are going to give us massage 

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:07.680
 opening the forum will help us prepare 

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:09.510
 let's say it's the base of the hair ok 

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:11.670
 then we are going to apply our oil 

00:02:09.510 --> 00:02:13.440
 of cacahoatán che and what brings what I brought 

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:14.850
 here for the presentation but it's 

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:17.040
 they will sell them like these 

00:02:14.850 --> 00:02:18.240
 these little plastic cups 

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:20.910
 those in the suits so they're 

00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:22.500
 familiar and suddenly do not feel 

00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:23.880
 is that they have sold it to me in this 

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:25.350
 presentation does not matter this is the 

00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:28.230
 original bottle with which you're going 

00:02:25.350 --> 00:02:30.840
 to sell and you're going to give a special massage 

00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:32.750
 on that scalp and you're going to start 

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:35.880
 you'll even feel a little bit of heat 

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:37.830
 you never feel heat this we're going to 

00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:40.110
 leave at the root this is with our 

00:02:37.830 --> 00:02:42.510
 fingers of normal way of massage like this is 

00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:44.010
 This is but just if you said it 

00:02:42.510 --> 00:02:45.840
 dry hair hair wet hair 

00:02:44.010 --> 00:02:48.030
 dry hair dry hair this if it is 

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:49.590
 before going to bathe although I 

00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:50.970
 I suggest that these treatments do not end 

00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:53.640
 of the week the day that you have of 

00:02:50.970 --> 00:02:55.100
 rest take it to pamper yourself 

00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:58.200
 conscious and of course your hair 

00:02:55.100 --> 00:03:00.150
 then we want this massage then 

00:02:58.200 --> 00:03:02.970
 and we are going to apply our oil 

00:03:00.150 --> 00:03:04.800
 mamey bone will take after 

00:03:02.970 --> 00:03:07.710
 where we apply our first oil 

00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:10.650
 towards the entire length of the hair and 

00:03:07.710 --> 00:03:13.080
 tips ok what happens with this 

00:03:10.650 --> 00:03:15.319
 combination 1 strengthens the other day 

00:03:13.080 --> 00:03:17.659
 Silky shine 

00:03:15.319 --> 00:03:20.659
 a lot of eye when we already put ourselves 

00:03:17.659 --> 00:03:22.159
 this mixture we are going to braid the hair or 

00:03:20.659 --> 00:03:24.019
 let's do like a changuito guy 

00:03:22.159 --> 00:03:26.209
 We can advise to support us with these 

00:03:24.019 --> 00:03:28.879
 tweezers that I also brought them and then 

00:03:26.209 --> 00:03:30.889
 We put the cap on the plastic cap that 

00:03:28.879 --> 00:03:32.420
 here they have it also I insist that the 

00:03:30.889 --> 00:03:34.400
 because they are going to give you that warmth 

00:03:32.420 --> 00:03:37.370
 who also needs our hair 

00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:39.859
 to penetrate these eye components 

00:03:37.370 --> 00:03:41.870
 when you already get to bathe with water 

00:03:39.859 --> 00:03:44.120
 warm warm and then we go to 

00:03:41.870 --> 00:03:47.359
 what cold remember we use for 

00:03:44.120 --> 00:03:49.010
 course our conditioning but the 

00:03:47.359 --> 00:03:50.689
 people who have the situation of in 

00:03:49.010 --> 00:03:52.430
 this case of sun and they just had 

00:03:50.689 --> 00:03:55.189
 baby and they constantly fall 

00:03:52.430 --> 00:03:57.859
 hair I suggest that the conditioner 

00:03:55.189 --> 00:03:59.659
 just put it on the tips if 

00:03:57.859 --> 00:04:01.909
 they usually tell you from means to ends 

00:03:59.659 --> 00:04:04.280
 you apply it I do not know if your hair is 

00:04:01.909 --> 00:04:07.400
 in layers as it separates the layers as 

00:04:04.280 --> 00:04:09.980
 that you can go only tips only tips and 

00:04:07.400 --> 00:04:11.780
 when you are going to untangle we are going to use 

00:04:09.980 --> 00:04:14.780
 this wonderful comb I leave to 

00:04:11.780 --> 00:04:16.609
 front sp helps us because it's not going to 

00:04:14.780 --> 00:04:19.130
 bust the tips of your hair 

00:04:16.609 --> 00:04:20.840
 then imagine if at first what 

00:04:19.130 --> 00:04:21.829
 you can do in your house twice per 

00:04:20.840 --> 00:04:23.569
 week 

00:04:21.829 --> 00:04:26.389
 One month later we will do it once 

00:04:23.569 --> 00:04:28.669
 per week and well how long did we 

00:04:26.389 --> 00:04:30.680
 we have to leave this in 15 minutes 

00:04:28.669 --> 00:04:32.719
 for me I think that is enough and more 

00:04:30.680 --> 00:04:34.699
 right now you come from a process where you've 

00:04:32.719 --> 00:04:36.889
 had your hair where you have it sunny 

00:04:34.699 --> 00:04:38.750
 now that they come on vacation what 

00:04:36.889 --> 00:04:42.469
 restructure very well because right now 

00:04:38.750 --> 00:04:45.259
 between the beach the sun is the sea this 

00:04:42.469 --> 00:04:47.300
 although in the clear sea from lowered room 

00:04:45.259 --> 00:04:49.280
 waiting when you return, you have to 

00:04:47.300 --> 00:04:51.080
 pass the bill if you did not put a 

00:04:49.280 --> 00:04:52.879
 treatment before entering the sea or if 

00:04:51.080 --> 00:04:55.129
 you're going to sunbathe then we're going to 

00:04:52.879 --> 00:04:57.169
 restructure what now they come back with 

00:04:55.129 --> 00:04:59.120
 this wonderful recipe today I have seen 

00:04:57.169 --> 00:05:00.440
 also that there are caps that sell 

00:04:59.120 --> 00:05:02.240
 in these stores where they sell many 

00:05:00.440 --> 00:05:04.159
 beauty products that you can or can 

00:05:02.240 --> 00:05:06.080
 be you put your hat and have as a 

00:05:04.159 --> 00:05:07.909
 tube where the sale is the tube of the 

00:05:06.080 --> 00:05:09.560
 dryer area that goes through all the 

00:05:07.909 --> 00:05:11.300
 heat that is what helps put a 

00:05:09.560 --> 00:05:13.719
 little more heat with the dryer for 

00:05:11.300 --> 00:05:15.979
 Of course it helps and if you do not have good 

00:05:13.719 --> 00:05:17.690
 let's say in some community that sees us 

00:05:15.979 --> 00:05:20.029
 our friends and do not have that cap or 

00:05:17.690 --> 00:05:21.800
 do not come there do not worry 

00:05:20.029 --> 00:05:23.419
 that yes this the markets where 

00:05:21.800 --> 00:05:25.550
 they sell beauty things is very 

00:05:23.419 --> 00:05:27.469
 good open sea of plastic and if so 

00:05:25.550 --> 00:05:27.940
 you go to the dryer above if you 

00:05:27.469 --> 00:05:31.810
 have 

00:05:27.940 --> 00:05:34.270
 and if not 15 minutes nothing more a little 

00:05:31.810 --> 00:05:36.820
 with dryer and ready 

00:05:34.270 --> 00:05:38.950
 now of bañeros also also to 

00:05:36.820 --> 00:05:42.190
 of course and more who knows that there 

00:05:38.950 --> 00:05:46.510
 there is baldness tendency then good 

00:05:42.190 --> 00:05:48.310
 what a great recipe they loaded h the most 

00:05:46.510 --> 00:05:50.200
 I swear that if this time I'm more good 

00:05:48.310 --> 00:05:55.750
 scared because if I said I had heard 

00:05:50.200 --> 00:05:58.890
 that after pregnancy but not for that 

00:05:55.750 --> 00:05:58.890
 the way the woman is about the way 

00:06:00.480 --> 00:06:04.780
 this remedy works also for 

00:06:03.460 --> 00:06:07.120
 people who have the scalp 

00:06:04.780 --> 00:06:09.160
 very greasy they have problems of 

00:06:07.120 --> 00:06:12.270
 dandruff when they have dandruff problems 

00:06:09.160 --> 00:06:15.640
 they serve very well if your situation is a 

00:06:12.270 --> 00:06:17.170
 oily scalp eye because 

00:06:15.640 --> 00:06:19.090
 also if it is fatty and 7 street the 

00:06:17.170 --> 00:06:21.400
 hair serves you if it's greasy and not 

00:06:19.090 --> 00:06:24.010
 only uses the bone so 

00:06:21.400 --> 00:06:26.710
 that does not go from the root but nothing 

00:06:24.010 --> 00:06:28.980
 more towards asís good one centimeter from 

00:06:26.710 --> 00:06:28.980
 the root 

00:06:29.010 --> 00:06:33.610
 We can use treaty key 

00:06:31.900 --> 00:06:34.139
 chemically like that of your server to 

00:06:33.610 --> 00:06:35.520
 she 

00:06:34.139 --> 00:06:38.009
 have all night put on a 

00:06:35.520 --> 00:06:40.110
 treatment that I will share 

00:06:38.009 --> 00:06:44.520
 let's do it but it has been damaged a lot 

00:06:40.110 --> 00:06:46.680
 so it 's putting press sleep and you 

00:06:44.520 --> 00:06:48.449
 go the next day you can do it and 

00:06:46.680 --> 00:06:50.370
 Well, if you're married and your husband does not 

00:06:48.449 --> 00:06:52.289
 like the smell, well do not do it in 

00:06:50.370 --> 00:06:54.960
 the night then because if it's not something 

00:06:52.289 --> 00:06:57.360
 very seductive but if you wear it what you 

00:06:54.960 --> 00:07:04.949
 go and then let the seduction grow 

00:06:57.360 --> 00:07:06.509
 come back when with these 

00:07:04.949 --> 00:07:09.659
 seduction of today as we are 

00:07:06.509 --> 00:07:11.250
 forging good habits because we all 

00:07:09.659 --> 00:07:13.490
 we go to the other side of the house others 

00:07:11.250 --> 00:07:13.490
 Thank you
