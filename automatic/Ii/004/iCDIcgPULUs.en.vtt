to practice in rush and I personally

00:04:32.330 --> 00:04:35.350 
to practice in rush and I personally
recommend<00:04:32.620> operation<00:04:33.620> firestorm<00:04:33.919> a<00:04:34.550> couple

00:04:35.350 --> 00:04:35.360 
recommend operation firestorm a couple

00:04:35.360 --> 00:04:37.060 
recommend operation firestorm a couple
of<00:04:35.419> reasons<00:04:35.510> for<00:04:35.780> this<00:04:35.930> number<00:04:36.290> one<00:04:36.530> is<00:04:36.830> at

of reasons for this number one is at
least<00:04:37.100> on<00:04:37.430> consoles<00:04:37.970> there's<00:04:38.270> only<00:04:38.390> one<00:04:38.750> plane

00:04:39.100 --> 00:04:39.110 
least on consoles there's only one plane

00:04:39.110 --> 00:04:41.140 
least on consoles there's only one plane
on<00:04:39.290> each<00:04:39.500> side<00:04:39.890> so<00:04:40.580> that<00:04:40.729> you're<00:04:40.910> not<00:04:40.970> going<00:04:41.090> to

great enemy pilots just one on one you
can<00:04:47.180> really<00:04:47.330> practice<00:04:47.600> better<00:04:48.020> number<00:04:48.530> two

00:04:48.760 --> 00:04:48.770 
can really practice better number two

00:04:48.770 --> 00:04:52.000 
can really practice better number two

going<00:06:08.500> on<00:06:08.650> here<00:06:08.920> is<00:06:09.070> you<00:06:09.130> start<00:06:09.730> off<00:06:09.850> spawning

00:06:10.560 --> 00:06:10.570 
going on here is you start off spawning

as an engineer I recommend running with

00:06:13.840 --> 00:06:16.620 
as an engineer I recommend running with
the<00:06:14.880> explosives<00:06:15.880> perk<00:06:16.180> so<00:06:16.390> you<00:06:16.480> end<00:06:16.600> up

00:06:16.620 --> 00:06:16.630 
the explosives perk so you end up

00:06:16.630 --> 00:06:19.080 
the explosives perk so you end up
getting<00:06:16.750> six<00:06:17.230> mines<00:06:17.640> throw<00:06:18.640> them<00:06:18.760> down<00:06:18.940> or

00:06:19.080 --> 00:06:19.090 
getting six mines throw them down or

00:06:24.810 --> 00:06:24.820 
together so that it will be an instant

together so that it will be an instant
kill<00:06:25.000> and<00:06:25.240> not<00:06:25.330> just<00:06:25.510> a<00:06:25.660> disable<00:06:26.140> a<00:06:26.230> disable

and then you suicide or get killed and

00:06:31.590 --> 00:06:31.600 
go spawn in a jet now I skip through

00:06:31.600 --> 00:06:32.610 
go spawn in a jet now I skip through
that<00:06:31.720> because<00:06:31.870> I<00:06:31.900> actually<00:06:32.020> stayed<00:06:32.320> alive<00:06:32.560> for

00:06:32.610 --> 00:06:32.620 
that because I actually stayed alive for

a<00:06:32.860> while<00:06:33.070> until<00:06:33.400> I<00:06:33.580> saw<00:06:33.790> one<00:06:33.940> of<00:06:34.030> our<00:06:34.120> jets<00:06:34.390> was

00:06:34.560 --> 00:06:34.570 
a while until I saw one of our jets was

00:06:34.570 --> 00:06:37.830 
a while until I saw one of our jets was
back<00:06:35.070> once<00:06:36.070> you<00:06:36.190> get<00:06:36.310> in<00:06:36.400> jet<00:06:36.640> you<00:06:36.880> hop<00:06:37.030> in<00:06:37.270> and

00:06:37.830 --> 00:06:37.840 
back once you get in jet you hop in and

00:06:37.840 --> 00:06:39.990 
back once you get in jet you hop in and
you<00:06:37.930> fly<00:06:38.170> around<00:06:38.320> and<00:06:38.740> you<00:06:38.800> stay<00:06:39.040> alive<00:06:39.280> flying

00:06:39.990 --> 00:06:40.000 
you fly around and you stay alive flying

00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:41.700 
you fly around and you stay alive flying
in<00:06:40.150> your<00:06:40.270> jet<00:06:40.570> I<00:06:40.810> know<00:06:41.170> that's<00:06:41.470> pretty

00:06:41.700 --> 00:06:41.710 
in your jet I know that's pretty

00:06:41.710 --> 00:06:44.130 
in your jet I know that's pretty
difficult<00:06:41.920> right<00:06:42.540> go<00:06:43.540> ahead<00:06:43.600> and<00:06:43.750> fade<00:06:43.960> into

00:06:44.130 --> 00:06:44.140 
difficult right go ahead and fade into

00:06:44.140 --> 00:06:46.620 
difficult right go ahead and fade into
the<00:06:44.320> final<00:06:44.770> clip<00:06:44.980> here<00:06:45.280> this<00:06:46.270> clip<00:06:46.510> was

00:06:46.620 --> 00:06:46.630 
the final clip here this clip was

00:06:46.630 --> 00:06:48.690 
the final clip here this clip was
actually<00:06:47.020> there<00:06:47.260> earlier<00:06:47.770> where<00:06:48.070> I<00:06:48.100> dodged<00:06:48.460> a

00:06:48.690 --> 00:06:48.700 
actually there earlier where I dodged a

00:06:48.700 --> 00:06:50.850 
actually there earlier where I dodged a
rocket<00:06:49.180> I'm<00:06:49.750> not<00:06:49.930> shooting<00:06:50.170> anything<00:06:50.470> I'm<00:06:50.830> not

00:06:50.850 --> 00:06:50.860 
rocket I'm not shooting anything I'm not

00:06:52.500 --> 00:06:52.510 
attacking anything I'm just flying

00:06:52.510 --> 00:06:55.440 
attacking anything I'm just flying
around<00:06:52.780> minding<00:06:53.140> my<00:06:53.290> own<00:06:53.320> business<00:06:53.440> and<00:06:54.450> what

00:06:55.440 --> 00:06:55.450 
around minding my own business and what

00:06:55.450 --> 00:06:59.700 
around minding my own business and what
do<00:06:55.510> you<00:06:55.600> know<00:06:55.810> BAM<00:06:56.700> tons<00:06:57.700> of<00:06:57.970> points<00:06:58.240> all<00:06:58.810> going

00:06:59.700 --> 00:06:59.710 
do you know BAM tons of points all going

00:06:59.710 --> 00:07:02.580 
do you know BAM tons of points all going
towards<00:07:00.070> my<00:07:00.250> jet<00:07:00.640> it's<00:07:01.380> beautiful<00:07:02.380> thing

00:07:02.580 --> 00:07:02.590 
towards my jet it's beautiful thing

00:07:02.590 --> 00:07:04.040 
towards my jet it's beautiful thing
let's<00:07:03.010> watch<00:07:03.220> it<00:07:03.430> again

00:07:04.040 --> 00:07:04.050 
let's watch it again

00:07:04.050 --> 00:07:05.880 
let's watch it again
and<00:07:05.050> this<00:07:05.320> time<00:07:05.500> we're<00:07:05.650> going<00:07:05.740> to<00:07:05.800> actually

00:07:05.880 --> 00:07:05.890 
and this time we're going to actually

00:07:05.890 --> 00:07:07.410 
and this time we're going to actually
pause<00:07:06.280> it<00:07:06.520> and<00:07:06.610> zoom<00:07:06.880> in<00:07:07.030> at<00:07:07.150> the<00:07:07.270> bottom

00:07:07.410 --> 00:07:07.420 
pause it and zoom in at the bottom

00:07:07.420 --> 00:07:11.430 
pause it and zoom in at the bottom
you'll<00:07:07.780> actually<00:07:08.020> see<00:07:08.680> I<00:07:09.510> get<00:07:10.510> the<00:07:10.750> points<00:07:11.200> and
