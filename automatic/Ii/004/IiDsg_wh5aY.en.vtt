00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:38.670 
this it looks like a seed it's about

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:50.300 
this it looks like a seed it's about
or<00:01:39.670> maybe<00:01:39.820> a<00:01:39.970> foot<00:01:40.450> long<00:01:46.440> insider<00:01:47.440> now

anyway I didn't turn out am stuff anyway
that<00:02:25.630> works<00:02:36.810> has<00:02:37.810> to<00:02:37.900> be<00:02:37.959> set<00:02:38.140> up<00:02:38.170> I<00:02:38.290> never<00:02:38.470> set

00:02:38.699 --> 00:02:38.709 
that works has to be set up I never set

00:02:38.709 --> 00:02:46.140 
that works has to be set up I never set
up<00:02:38.860> that<00:02:39.280> works<00:02:43.830> info<00:02:44.830> navigation<00:02:45.700> is<00:02:45.850> not

00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:46.150 
up that works info navigation is not

00:02:46.150 --> 00:02:48.630 
up that works info navigation is not
active<00:02:46.720> so<00:02:46.780> navigation<00:02:47.620> not<00:02:47.709> active<00:02:48.010> that

00:02:48.630 --> 00:02:48.640 
active so navigation not active that

00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:51.150 
active so navigation not active that
means<00:02:48.880> I<00:02:49.230> guess<00:02:50.230> you<00:02:50.320> have<00:02:50.410> to<00:02:50.440> active<00:02:50.799> it<00:02:50.860> and
