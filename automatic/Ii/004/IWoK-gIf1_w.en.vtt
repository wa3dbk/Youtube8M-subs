of giant robot zombies i think the new
zombies<00:03:29.069> map<00:03:29.099> is<00:03:29.459> called<00:03:29.790> origins<00:03:30.690> and<00:03:30.979> this

00:03:31.969 --> 00:03:31.979 
zombies map is called origins and this

00:03:31.979 --> 00:03:33.619 
zombies map is called origins and this
new<00:03:32.159> map<00:03:32.579> pack<00:03:32.849> as<00:03:33.030> a<00:03:33.060> whole<00:03:33.269> is<00:03:33.419> called

new map pack as a whole is called

00:03:33.629 --> 00:03:35.089 
new map pack as a whole is called
apocalypse<00:03:34.379> which<00:03:34.560> is<00:03:34.680> kind<00:03:34.859> of<00:03:34.949> strange

00:03:35.089 --> 00:03:35.099 
apocalypse which is kind of strange

00:03:35.099 --> 00:03:36.289 
apocalypse which is kind of strange
because<00:03:35.370> it<00:03:35.579> doesn't<00:03:35.790> it<00:03:35.970> doesn't<00:03:36.030> really

00:03:36.289 --> 00:03:36.299 
because it doesn't it doesn't really

00:03:36.299 --> 00:03:37.789 
because it doesn't it doesn't really
have<00:03:36.479> anything<00:03:36.659> to<00:03:36.870> do<00:03:37.019> with<00:03:37.169> an<00:03:37.260> apocalypse

00:03:37.789 --> 00:03:37.799 
have anything to do with an apocalypse

00:03:37.799 --> 00:03:39.740 
have anything to do with an apocalypse
just<00:03:37.949> like<00:03:38.250> vengeance<00:03:38.819> didn't<00:03:39.419> have<00:03:39.540> anything

00:03:39.740 --> 00:03:39.750 
just like vengeance didn't have anything

00:03:39.750 --> 00:03:41.270 
just like vengeance didn't have anything
to<00:03:39.900> do<00:03:40.049> with<00:03:40.169> the<00:03:40.260> real<00:03:40.409> vengeance<00:03:40.919> it's<00:03:41.129> just

00:03:41.270 --> 00:03:41.280 
to do with the real vengeance it's just

00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:42.860 
to do with the real vengeance it's just
a<00:03:41.400> name<00:03:41.609> that<00:03:41.669> they<00:03:42.000> give<00:03:42.150> the<00:03:42.299> map<00:03:42.479> pack<00:03:42.690> it

00:03:42.860 --> 00:03:42.870 
a name that they give the map pack it

00:03:42.870 --> 00:03:44.479 
a name that they give the map pack it
doesn't<00:03:43.079> really<00:03:43.199> mean<00:03:43.440> anything<00:03:43.470> at<00:03:44.220> least<00:03:44.280> I

00:03:44.479 --> 00:03:44.489 
doesn't really mean anything at least I

00:03:44.489 --> 00:03:45.710 
doesn't really mean anything at least I
don't<00:03:44.579> think<00:03:44.729> there<00:03:45.090> might<00:03:45.180> be<00:03:45.239> some<00:03:45.479> sort<00:03:45.629> of

00:03:45.710 --> 00:03:45.720 
don't think there might be some sort of

00:03:45.720 --> 00:03:47.960 
don't think there might be some sort of
hidden<00:03:46.319> meaning<00:03:47.190> maybe<00:03:47.430> there's<00:03:47.639> some<00:03:47.819> sort

00:03:47.960 --> 00:03:47.970 
hidden meaning maybe there's some sort

00:03:47.970 --> 00:03:49.520 
hidden meaning maybe there's some sort
of<00:03:48.090> hidden<00:03:48.269> meaning<00:03:48.629> to<00:03:48.720> all<00:03:48.750> this<00:03:49.019> black<00:03:49.260> ops
