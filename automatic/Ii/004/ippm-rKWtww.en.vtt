was using the new Christmas camo which

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:22.340 
was using the new Christmas camo which
is<00:00:20.100> absolutely<00:00:20.789> amazing<00:00:21.119> I<00:00:21.510> like<00:00:21.840> the<00:00:21.990> red<00:00:22.199> and

00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:22.350 
is absolutely amazing I like the red and

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:24.140 
is absolutely amazing I like the red and
green<00:00:22.410> how<00:00:22.710> it<00:00:22.859> goes<00:00:23.070> together<00:00:23.279> I<00:00:23.670> mean<00:00:24.000> the

00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:24.150 
green how it goes together I mean the

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:26.060 
green how it goes together I mean the
camo<00:00:24.449> I<00:00:24.600> think<00:00:24.900> could<00:00:25.140> be<00:00:25.260> a<00:00:25.289> little<00:00:25.560> bit<00:00:25.859> more

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:26.070 
camo I think could be a little bit more

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:27.950 
camo I think could be a little bit more
vibrant<00:00:26.609> and<00:00:26.699> colors<00:00:26.939> meaning<00:00:27.420> the<00:00:27.689> colors

00:00:27.950 --> 00:00:27.960 
vibrant and colors meaning the colors

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:29.179 
vibrant and colors meaning the colors
could<00:00:28.140> have<00:00:28.260> been<00:00:28.380> a<00:00:28.410> little<00:00:28.560> brighter<00:00:28.920> that

00:00:29.179 --> 00:00:29.189 
could have been a little brighter that

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:30.919 
could have been a little brighter that
could<00:00:29.310> have<00:00:29.400> been<00:00:29.519> deeper<00:00:30.179> Reds<00:00:30.420> and<00:00:30.660> deeper

00:00:30.919 --> 00:00:30.929 
could have been deeper Reds and deeper

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:33.200 
could have been deeper Reds and deeper
greens<00:00:31.170> and<00:00:31.470> then<00:00:32.040> this<00:00:32.279> looks<00:00:32.579> kind<00:00:32.850> of<00:00:32.969> sort

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:33.210 
greens and then this looks kind of sort

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:34.910 
greens and then this looks kind of sort
of<00:00:33.239> like<00:00:33.420> a<00:00:33.450> Christmas<00:00:33.989> tree<00:00:34.020> but<00:00:34.680> it<00:00:34.770> is<00:00:34.890> a
