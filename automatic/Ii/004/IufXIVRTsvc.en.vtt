 new series of tips today 

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:33.900
 we will tackle the equipment 

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:36.200
 necessary for the smooth running of your 

00:00:33.900 --> 00:00:36.200
 race 

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:45.329
 so we'll see now the 

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:48.600
 obligatory material so in a 

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:51.600
 first time we have the bag with the 

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:52.640
 whistle that is integrated as well as the ain 

00:00:51.600 --> 00:01:02.879
 water bag 

00:00:52.640 --> 00:01:06.270
 we have the convent then we have 

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:09.150
 the sticky binding both lamps 

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:09.600
 with spare batteries cover 

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:12.630
 survival 

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:13.560
 the elastic band the cup the 

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:18.110
 cellphone 

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:20.780
 the identity card the 20 euros leboeuf 

00:01:18.110 --> 00:01:24.149
 and energy products 

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:27.270
 on this I advise you to add 

00:01:24.149 --> 00:01:29.850
 so your little trash that you 

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:32.070
 will manage your waste you 

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:34.050
 are nothing in nature what do you 

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:38.340
 will also manage your race 

00:01:34.050 --> 00:01:42.149
 it's going to be the gps heart rate monitor 

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:44.340
 so and finally me so I use the 

00:01:42.149 --> 00:01:46.380
 sticks 3 strands to allow me to 

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:48.420
 make better intentions and 

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:49.770
 especially in three strands it allows to have 

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:53.509
 a product that is much easier 

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:53.509
 to adjust much easier to store 

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:55.610
 and 

00:01:57.650 --> 00:02:02.090
 so for the success of your test 

00:01:59.270 --> 00:02:04.520
 you have the option to courmayeur 

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:06.200
 so at 78th kilometers to put a bag 

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:08.390
 in which you will deposit 

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:10.399
 different different products textile 

00:02:08.390 --> 00:02:15.470
 that will allow you to have currency 

00:02:10.399 --> 00:02:17.060
 during this refueling so know 

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:19.430
 in the mountains you can 

00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:21.560
 meet all types of conditions there 

00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:23.540
 including extreme conditions that this 

00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:24.200
 either heat or bass 

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:26.960
 temperatures 

00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:29.510
 so at that moment in the bag we put 

00:02:26.960 --> 00:02:32.540
 we put the products for heat 

00:02:29.510 --> 00:02:35.060
 so hats tee shirts us without 

00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:39.200
 sleeve a small vest possibly the 

00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:41.500
 beef and shorts and so aptly 

00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:43.790
 on the contrary we have conditions rather 

00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:45.880
 bad as we no longer met 

00:02:43.790 --> 00:02:48.800
 last year at the big ferret pass 

00:02:45.880 --> 00:02:51.580
 you will be able to use so tee 

00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:55.310
 long sleeve shirt with gloves cups 

00:02:51.580 --> 00:03:00.290
 headlines as well as a convent that 

00:02:55.310 --> 00:03:01.640
 is going to be a lot thicker then I 

00:03:00.290 --> 00:03:03.830
 advise you to put a towel 

00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:05.239
 possibly to rinse you 

00:03:03.830 --> 00:03:06.320
 clean a little bit of salt that you 

00:03:05.239 --> 00:03:08.470
 are going to have on the face when you 

00:03:06.320 --> 00:03:11.570
 go to your bag 

00:03:08.470 --> 00:03:14.450
 of course food reserves one of 

00:03:11.570 --> 00:03:17.420
 bars of the drinks gels 

00:03:14.450 --> 00:03:20.330
 fast refills without forgetting so a 

00:03:17.420 --> 00:03:22.700
 water pouch or loved ones spare that 

00:03:20.330 --> 00:03:24.890
 you can have in the background 

00:03:22.700 --> 00:03:27.019
 only in case we never know and then I 

00:03:24.890 --> 00:03:30.500
 what I advise you so it'll be 

00:03:27.019 --> 00:03:33.470
 a pair of spare shoes from 

00:03:30.500 --> 00:03:37.760
 socks to really change and to 

00:03:33.470 --> 00:03:40.070
 see off on the right foot with ointment 

00:03:37.760 --> 00:03:41.900
 of course for rest mas of evo foot me 

00:03:40.070 --> 00:03:44.959
 I use so I redo the bca 

00:03:41.900 --> 00:03:47.209
 full mid-course of amino acids 

00:03:44.959 --> 00:03:49.640
 so that we can continue to 

00:03:47.209 --> 00:03:51.739
 take it all along the race in 

00:03:49.640 --> 00:03:54.680
 average of every four hours and 

00:03:51.739 --> 00:03:57.320
 then the little thing is going to be the roll 

00:03:54.680 --> 00:03:59.989
 the scotch roll that is used to 

00:03:57.320 --> 00:04:01.910
 repair the different little worries 

00:03:59.989 --> 00:04:02.420
 that we may meet on 

00:04:01.910 --> 00:04:04.430
 test 

00:04:02.420 --> 00:04:05.780
 so it can be a strap that can 

00:04:04.430 --> 00:04:07.750
 to be something that bothers you 

00:04:05.780 --> 00:04:09.370
 so do not hesitate 

00:04:07.750 --> 00:04:11.650
 scotch roll it's not heavy and 

00:04:09.370 --> 00:04:13.000
 then your intermediate bag that you 

00:04:11.650 --> 00:04:14.950
 will get you out of some 

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:18.880
 small situations always a little bit 

00:04:14.950 --> 00:04:20.470
 tricky after introducing you 

00:04:18.880 --> 00:04:22.800
 all the equipment necessary to 

00:04:20.470 --> 00:04:25.870
 the good realization of your test 

00:04:22.800 --> 00:04:28.090
 the idea to the press and test it this 

00:04:25.870 --> 00:04:29.620
 material in condition when the sessions 

00:04:28.090 --> 00:04:30.910
 are really the moments 

00:04:29.620 --> 00:04:34.600
 conducive to this test 

00:04:30.910 --> 00:04:36.130
 and then it really does not have 

00:04:34.600 --> 00:04:40.150
 bad surprise on the day of the race 

00:04:36.130 --> 00:04:41.560
 so well ahead for training and 

00:04:40.150 --> 00:04:44.100
 and then next week for 

00:04:41.560 --> 00:04:44.100
 new tips 

00:04:48.110 --> 00:04:51.450
 things really primordial the paper 

00:04:51.030 --> 00:04:54.390
 toilet 

00:04:51.450 --> 00:04:56.130
 the toilet paper that is you 

00:04:54.390 --> 00:04:58.560
 will use and when you have it 

00:04:56.130 --> 00:04:59.910
 used do not hesitate to burn it from 

00:04:58.560 --> 00:05:00.510
 so that from a point of view 

00:04:59.910 --> 00:05:02.190
 ecological 

00:05:00.510 --> 00:05:05.010
 we do not end up with swarms 

00:05:02.190 --> 00:05:06.900
 of toilet paper so for this I you 

00:05:05.010 --> 00:05:10.700
 also advises placing it in a 

00:05:06.900 --> 00:05:13.740
 waterproof bag one so as not to have any 

00:05:10.700 --> 00:05:16.410
 problem since the paper takes 

00:05:13.740 --> 00:05:18.690
 moisture fast enough so that's it 

00:05:16.410 --> 00:05:19.680
 the bulk of what you should be there 

00:05:18.690 --> 00:05:21.450
 place in your bag 

00:05:19.680 --> 00:05:23.580
 I advise you very strongly to have 

00:05:21.450 --> 00:05:26.600
 everything is changed so that it can 

00:05:23.580 --> 00:05:26.600
 to make up for any eventuality
