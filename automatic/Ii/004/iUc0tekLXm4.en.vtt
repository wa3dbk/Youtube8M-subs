you know kind of working on things
getting<00:00:10.980> things<00:00:11.219> ready<00:00:11.690> but<00:00:12.690> I<00:00:12.960> do<00:00:13.110> have<00:00:13.650> a

00:00:14.150 --> 00:00:14.160 
getting things ready but I do have a

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:17.510 
getting things ready but I do have a
prototype<00:00:14.549> of<00:00:15.389> one<00:00:15.780> of<00:00:15.900> the<00:00:15.980> overflows<00:00:16.980> and<00:00:17.430> if

00:00:17.510 --> 00:00:17.520 
prototype of one of the overflows and if

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:19.099 
prototype of one of the overflows and if
it<00:00:17.640> works<00:00:17.850> of<00:00:18.029> course<00:00:18.240> I'm<00:00:18.390> gonna<00:00:18.510> use<00:00:18.750> it<00:00:18.930> then

00:00:19.099 --> 00:00:19.109 
it works of course I'm gonna use it then

00:00:19.109 --> 00:00:24.349 
it works of course I'm gonna use it then
it'll<00:00:19.289> become<00:00:20.420> you<00:00:21.420> know<00:00:21.449> a<00:00:22.130> working<00:00:23.359> overflow

00:00:24.349 --> 00:00:24.359 
it'll become you know a working overflow

00:00:24.359 --> 00:00:28.519 
it'll become you know a working overflow
but<00:00:24.689> here<00:00:25.380> it<00:00:25.470> is<00:00:26.810> it's<00:00:27.810> the<00:00:27.960> same<00:00:28.199> design

00:00:28.519 --> 00:00:28.529 
but here it is it's the same design

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:30.500 
but here it is it's the same design
cyclic<00:00:29.039> mantle<00:00:29.310> nine<00:00:29.490> uses<00:00:29.970> I'm<00:00:30.119> not<00:00:30.240> doing

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:30.510 
cyclic mantle nine uses I'm not doing

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:32.209 
cyclic mantle nine uses I'm not doing
anything<00:00:30.720> new<00:00:31.080> here<00:00:31.439> the<00:00:31.590> only<00:00:31.740> thing<00:00:31.859> that<00:00:32.189> I

00:00:32.209 --> 00:00:32.219 
anything new here the only thing that I

00:00:32.219 --> 00:00:35.569 
anything new here the only thing that I
did<00:00:32.489> do<00:00:32.730> is<00:00:33.000> I<00:00:33.120> use<00:00:33.300> the<00:00:33.480> street<00:00:33.840> elbow<00:00:34.460> up<00:00:35.460> at

00:00:35.569 --> 00:00:35.579 
did do is I use the street elbow up at

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:37.940 
did do is I use the street elbow up at
the<00:00:35.670> top<00:00:35.910> to<00:00:36.090> kind<00:00:36.239> of<00:00:36.390> eliminate<00:00:36.829> more<00:00:37.829> of

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:37.950 
the top to kind of eliminate more of

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:41.450 
the top to kind of eliminate more of
this<00:00:38.070> gap<00:00:38.370> right<00:00:38.399> here<00:00:38.700> where<00:00:39.149> right<00:00:39.780> here<00:00:40.460> so

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:41.460 
this gap right here where right here so

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:43.369 
this gap right here where right here so
it'll<00:00:41.760> actually<00:00:41.940> sit<00:00:42.450> on<00:00:42.480> the<00:00:42.719> tank<00:00:42.960> better

00:00:43.369 --> 00:00:43.379 
it'll actually sit on the tank better

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:46.100 
it'll actually sit on the tank better
I<00:00:44.000> just<00:00:45.000> got<00:00:45.180> it<00:00:45.300> all<00:00:45.450> seam<00:00:45.750> in<00:00:45.899> it<00:00:45.930> together

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:46.110 
I just got it all seam in it together

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:49.940 
I just got it all seam in it together
and<00:00:46.969> so<00:00:47.969> it's<00:00:48.120> drawing<00:00:48.660> and<00:00:48.930> I<00:00:49.649> got<00:00:49.800> these

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:49.950 
and so it's drawing and I got these

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:52.569 
and so it's drawing and I got these
holes<00:00:50.280> drilled<00:00:50.700> up<00:00:50.879> at<00:00:51.030> the<00:00:51.120> top<00:00:51.329> right<00:00:51.600> here

00:00:52.569 --> 00:00:52.579 
holes drilled up at the top right here

00:00:52.579 --> 00:00:56.180 
holes drilled up at the top right here
you<00:00:53.579> know<00:00:53.699> I<00:00:54.000> might<00:00:54.329> drill<00:00:54.600> more<00:00:54.780> holes<00:00:55.190> you

00:00:56.180 --> 00:00:56.190 
you know I might drill more holes you

00:00:56.190 --> 00:00:58.520 
you know I might drill more holes you
know<00:00:56.309> I<00:00:56.550> might<00:00:56.820> not<00:00:56.850> I<00:00:57.270> don't<00:00:57.329> know<00:00:57.510> I<00:00:58.020> might

00:00:58.520 --> 00:00:58.530 
know I might not I don't know I might

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:00.139 
know I might not I don't know I might
actually<00:00:58.770> fill<00:00:59.250> in<00:00:59.430> some<00:00:59.670> of<00:00:59.699> these<00:00:59.879> holes

00:01:00.139 --> 00:01:00.149 
actually fill in some of these holes

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:02.869 
actually fill in some of these holes
with<00:01:00.420> some<00:01:00.600> silicone<00:01:01.050> or<00:01:01.199> something<00:01:01.670> but<00:01:02.670> you

00:01:02.869 --> 00:01:02.879 
with some silicone or something but you

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:05.329 
with some silicone or something but you
know<00:01:02.910> I'm<00:01:03.239> I'm<00:01:03.629> testing<00:01:04.199> it<00:01:04.320> I'm<00:01:04.979> gonna<00:01:05.100> see
