00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:49.110 
questions I get all the time a lot of

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:50.630 
questions I get all the time a lot of
you<00:01:49.259> guys<00:01:49.290> are<00:01:49.560> younger<00:01:49.710> you<00:01:49.950> know<00:01:49.979> you're<00:01:50.189> 14

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:50.640 
you guys are younger you know you're 14

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:52.969 
you guys are younger you know you're 14
15<00:01:51.240> and<00:01:51.450> right<00:01:52.079> now<00:01:52.229> it's<00:01:52.380> really<00:01:52.500> hard<00:01:52.770> to<00:01:52.890> get

00:01:52.969 --> 00:01:52.979 
15 and right now it's really hard to get

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:55.340 
15 and right now it's really hard to get
a<00:01:53.009> job<00:01:53.070> even<00:01:53.399> if<00:01:53.490> you're<00:01:53.670> adults<00:01:53.939> so<00:01:54.299> um<00:01:54.570> for

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:55.350 
a job even if you're adults so um for

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:56.870 
a job even if you're adults so um for
kids<00:01:55.619> it's<00:01:55.860> obviously<00:01:56.250> really<00:01:56.549> hard<00:01:56.759> to

00:01:56.870 --> 00:01:56.880 
kids it's obviously really hard to

00:01:56.880 --> 00:01:57.980 
kids it's obviously really hard to
especially<00:01:57.119> if<00:01:57.270> you<00:01:57.329> have<00:01:57.360> no<00:01:57.509> experience

00:01:57.980 --> 00:01:57.990 
especially if you have no experience

00:01:57.990 --> 00:01:59.480 
especially if you have no experience
maybe<00:01:58.619> you're<00:01:58.799> just<00:01:58.920> getting<00:01:59.189> an<00:01:59.280> allowance

00:01:59.480 --> 00:01:59.490 
maybe you're just getting an allowance

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:00.800 
maybe you're just getting an allowance
you're<00:01:59.820> not<00:01:59.909> making<00:02:00.149> a<00:02:00.210> lot<00:02:00.299> of<00:02:00.329> money<00:02:00.570> and

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:00.810 
you're not making a lot of money and

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:02.929 
you're not making a lot of money and
capture<00:02:01.350> cards<00:02:01.619> can<00:02:01.740> be<00:02:01.770> really<00:02:02.040> expensive<00:02:02.219> so

00:02:02.929 --> 00:02:02.939 
capture cards can be really expensive so

00:02:02.939 --> 00:02:04.429 
capture cards can be really expensive so
one<00:02:03.090> thing<00:02:03.210> I<00:02:03.329> recommend<00:02:03.479> getting<00:02:03.840> is<00:02:04.110> a<00:02:04.140> less

00:02:04.429 --> 00:02:04.439 
one thing I recommend getting is a less

00:02:04.439 --> 00:02:07.039 
one thing I recommend getting is a less
expensive<00:02:04.799> alternative<00:02:05.240> a<00:02:06.240> really<00:02:06.840> good<00:02:06.960> idea

00:02:07.039 --> 00:02:07.049 
expensive alternative a really good idea

00:02:07.049 --> 00:02:09.589 
expensive alternative a really good idea
is<00:02:07.469> the<00:02:07.680> roxio<00:02:08.310> game<00:02:08.429> capture<00:02:08.789> this<00:02:09.450> is

00:02:09.589 --> 00:02:09.599 
is the roxio game capture this is

00:02:09.599 --> 00:02:12.150 
is the roxio game capture this is
basically<00:02:10.020> it<00:02:10.319> I'll<00:02:11.160> get<00:02:11.370> a<00:02:11.400> little<00:02:11.640> more

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:12.160 
basically it I'll get a little more

00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:15.540 
basically it I'll get a little more
into<00:02:12.370> it<00:02:12.550> in<00:02:13.030> a<00:02:13.330> few<00:02:13.570> minutes<00:02:13.720> but<00:02:14.550> basically

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:15.550 
into it in a few minutes but basically

00:02:15.550 --> 00:02:17.820 
into it in a few minutes but basically
what's<00:02:16.120> good<00:02:16.360> about<00:02:16.450> this<00:02:16.600> is<00:02:16.990> it's<00:02:17.470> cheaper

00:02:17.820 --> 00:02:17.830 
what's good about this is it's cheaper

00:02:17.830 --> 00:02:20.550 
what's good about this is it's cheaper
than<00:02:17.860> others<00:02:18.250> and<00:02:18.780> for<00:02:19.780> the<00:02:19.900> price<00:02:20.080> you're

00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:20.560 
than others and for the price you're

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:22.320 
than others and for the price you're
getting<00:02:20.590> pretty<00:02:20.950> good<00:02:21.100> quality<00:02:21.460> and<00:02:21.940> that's

00:02:22.320 --> 00:02:22.330 
getting pretty good quality and that's

00:02:22.330 --> 00:02:23.610 
getting pretty good quality and that's
the<00:02:22.480> biggest<00:02:22.660> thing<00:02:22.840> is<00:02:23.050> having<00:02:23.200> good<00:02:23.470> quality

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:23.620 
the biggest thing is having good quality

00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:25.380 
the biggest thing is having good quality
but<00:02:23.980> if<00:02:24.070> you<00:02:24.160> can't<00:02:24.400> afford<00:02:24.490> it<00:02:24.730> and<00:02:24.910> there's

00:02:25.380 --> 00:02:25.390 
but if you can't afford it and there's

00:02:25.390 --> 00:02:27.570 
but if you can't afford it and there's
not<00:02:25.600> much<00:02:25.870> else<00:02:26.080> you<00:02:26.200> can<00:02:26.320> do<00:02:26.560> this<00:02:26.980> is<00:02:27.130> a<00:02:27.160> great

00:02:27.570 --> 00:02:27.580 
not much else you can do this is a great

00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:30.630 
not much else you can do this is a great
alternative<00:02:27.870> basically<00:02:28.870> um<00:02:29.220> it's<00:02:30.220> less

00:02:30.630 --> 00:02:30.640 
alternative basically um it's less

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:32.880 
alternative basically um it's less
expensive<00:02:31.020> so<00:02:32.020> you<00:02:32.080> guys<00:02:32.380> are<00:02:32.590> going<00:02:32.710> to<00:02:32.770> be

expensive so you guys are going to be

00:02:32.890 --> 00:02:34.860 
expensive so you guys are going to be
able<00:02:32.980> to<00:02:33.250> afford<00:02:33.490> it<00:02:33.970> and<00:02:34.150> it's<00:02:34.570> definitely

00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:34.870 
able to afford it and it's definitely

00:02:34.870 --> 00:02:35.640 
able to afford it and it's definitely
going<00:02:35.110> to<00:02:35.170> get<00:02:35.230> you<00:02:35.320> started<00:02:35.380> with<00:02:35.560> your

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:44.650 
then deciding that maybe this isn't for

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:00.730 
a more expensive capture card I also had

00:03:00.730 --> 00:03:02.730 
a more expensive capture card I also had
to<00:03:00.970> shell<00:03:01.270> out<00:03:01.390> an<00:03:01.540> extra<00:03:01.840> hundred<00:03:02.080> dollars<00:03:02.620> on

00:03:02.740 --> 00:03:04.740 
to shell out an extra hundred dollars on
editing<00:03:03.070> software<00:03:03.550> so<00:03:03.970> that<00:03:04.000> ended<00:03:04.480> up<00:03:04.570> being

00:03:04.740 --> 00:03:04.750 
editing software so that ended up being

00:03:04.750 --> 00:03:06.690 
editing software so that ended up being
a<00:03:04.840> lot<00:03:04.990> of<00:03:05.170> money<00:03:05.200> and<00:03:05.680> for<00:03:06.100> those<00:03:06.190> of<00:03:06.250> you<00:03:06.430> who

00:03:40.819 --> 00:03:40.829 
right here in this little setup right

00:03:40.829 --> 00:03:42.679 
right here in this little setup right

this is a pretty small look at the size
of<00:03:44.640> my<00:03:44.730> hand<00:03:44.909> within<00:03:45.180> I<00:03:45.390> have<00:03:45.540> really<00:03:45.810> small

00:03:45.860 --> 00:03:45.870 
of my hand within I have really small

00:03:45.870 --> 00:03:48.770 
of my hand within I have really small
hands<00:03:46.319> as<00:03:47.159> you<00:03:47.370> guys<00:03:47.519> know<00:03:47.579> so<00:03:48.390> that's<00:03:48.629> what's

00:03:48.770 --> 00:03:48.780 
hands as you guys know so that's what's

hands as you guys know so that's what's
really<00:03:48.989> good<00:03:49.260> about<00:03:49.290> this<00:03:49.680> I<00:03:49.859> mean<00:03:49.980> compared

00:03:50.360 --> 00:03:50.370 
really good about this I mean compared

00:03:50.370 --> 00:03:52.759 
really good about this I mean compared
to<00:03:50.489> other<00:03:51.019> capture<00:03:52.019> cards<00:03:52.349> this<00:03:52.500> is<00:03:52.620> really

00:03:52.759 --> 00:03:52.769 
to other capture cards this is really

00:03:52.769 --> 00:03:54.530 
to other capture cards this is really
tiny<00:03:53.069> and<00:03:53.280> it'll<00:03:53.579> probably<00:03:53.819> make<00:03:54.060> your

00:03:54.530 --> 00:03:54.540 
tiny and it'll probably make your

00:03:54.540 --> 00:03:56.209 
tiny and it'll probably make your
workspace<00:03:55.139> when<00:03:55.379> you<00:03:55.469> start<00:03:55.680> making<00:03:55.829> videos<00:03:55.950> a

00:03:56.209 --> 00:03:56.219 
workspace when you start making videos a

00:03:56.219 --> 00:03:58.459 
workspace when you start making videos a
lot<00:03:56.310> smaller<00:03:56.730> and<00:03:57.060> easier<00:03:57.120> to<00:03:57.420> manage<00:03:57.780> those

00:03:58.459 --> 00:03:58.469 
lot smaller and easier to manage those

00:03:58.469 --> 00:04:00.500 
lot smaller and easier to manage those
of<00:03:58.590> you<00:03:58.680> who<00:03:58.739> have<00:03:58.829> seen<00:03:59.010> mine<00:03:59.280> it's<00:04:00.090> crazy

00:04:00.500 --> 00:04:00.510 
of you who have seen mine it's crazy

00:04:00.510 --> 00:04:01.910 
of you who have seen mine it's crazy
it's<00:04:00.810> such<00:04:00.989> a<00:04:01.019> mess<00:04:01.260> all<00:04:01.379> the<00:04:01.500> cords<00:04:01.769> and<00:04:01.889> stuff

00:04:01.910 --> 00:04:01.920 
it's such a mess all the cords and stuff

00:04:01.920 --> 00:04:03.949 
it's such a mess all the cords and stuff
so<00:04:02.219> this<00:04:02.370> is<00:04:02.519> really<00:04:03.060> cool<00:04:03.329> to<00:04:03.510> have<00:04:03.629> since

00:04:03.949 --> 00:04:03.959 
so this is really cool to have since

so this is really cool to have since
it's<00:04:04.109> just<00:04:04.170> so<00:04:04.409> small<00:04:04.739> I<00:04:04.799> mean<00:04:05.010> that's<00:04:05.430> really
