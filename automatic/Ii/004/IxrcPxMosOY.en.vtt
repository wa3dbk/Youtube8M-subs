00:00:54.869 --> 00:00:54.879 
satisfied yeah I think I had a good

00:00:54.879 --> 00:00:58.729 
satisfied yeah I think I had a good
start<00:00:55.180> but<00:00:55.330> then<00:00:55.720> I<00:00:56.019> had<00:00:56.830> a<00:00:57.059> couple<00:00:58.059> bad<00:00:58.299> games

00:00:58.729 --> 00:00:58.739 
start but then I had a couple bad games

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:02.490 
start but then I had a couple bad games
but<00:00:59.739> it's<00:01:00.010> a<00:01:00.100> hockey<00:01:00.489> and<00:01:00.699> I<00:01:01.449> think<00:01:01.809> it's<00:01:01.900> going

00:01:02.490 --> 00:01:02.500 
but it's a hockey and I think it's going

00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:04.770 
but it's a hockey and I think it's going
to<00:01:02.559> be<00:01:02.769> the<00:01:03.159> same<00:01:03.400> like<00:01:03.610> when<00:01:04.000> you<00:01:04.059> start<00:01:04.330> right

00:01:04.770 --> 00:01:04.780 
to be the same like when you start right

00:01:04.780 --> 00:01:08.070 
to be the same like when you start right
now<00:01:05.970> and<00:01:06.970> I'm<00:01:07.119> sure<00:01:07.150> you<00:01:07.479> want<00:01:07.659> to<00:01:07.689> become

00:01:14.579 --> 00:01:17.789 
defenseman but what areas of your game
do<00:01:15.579> you<00:01:15.670> want<00:01:15.880> to<00:01:15.969> improve<00:01:16.270> upon<00:01:16.630> this<00:01:17.170> season

00:01:17.789 --> 00:01:17.799 
do you want to improve upon this season

00:01:17.799 --> 00:01:20.849 
do you want to improve upon this season
all<00:01:18.280> this<00:01:18.670> season<00:01:19.149> I<00:01:19.390> think<00:01:20.200> I<00:01:20.409> want<00:01:20.770> to

00:01:20.849 --> 00:01:20.859 
all this season I think I want to

00:01:20.859 --> 00:01:24.959 
all this season I think I want to
improve<00:01:21.189> my<00:01:21.780> defensive<00:01:22.780> side<00:01:22.960> of<00:01:23.200> Lion<00:01:23.969> so

00:01:24.959 --> 00:01:24.969 
improve my defensive side of Lion so

00:01:24.969 --> 00:01:28.109 
improve my defensive side of Lion so
staying<00:01:25.899> more<00:01:26.200> on<00:01:26.409> the<00:01:26.619> defensive<00:01:27.490> side<00:01:27.729> like

00:01:28.109 --> 00:01:28.119 
staying more on the defensive side like

00:01:28.119 --> 00:01:31.410 
staying more on the defensive side like
boxing<00:01:28.600> out<00:01:28.689> and<00:01:29.049> stuff<00:01:29.350> like<00:01:29.499> that<00:01:29.740> and<00:01:30.420> I

00:01:31.410 --> 00:01:31.420 
boxing out and stuff like that and I

00:01:31.420 --> 00:01:34.739 
boxing out and stuff like that and I
think<00:01:32.380> that<00:01:33.369> they<00:01:33.609> are<00:01:33.640> mostly<00:01:34.119> playing<00:01:34.420> here

00:01:34.739 --> 00:01:34.749 
think that they are mostly playing here

00:01:34.749 --> 00:01:37.410 
think that they are mostly playing here
like<00:01:35.100> one-on-one<00:01:36.100> in<00:01:36.310> the<00:01:36.399> corners<00:01:36.850> and<00:01:37.149> stuff

00:01:37.410 --> 00:01:37.420 
like one-on-one in the corners and stuff

00:01:37.420 --> 00:01:40.590 
like one-on-one in the corners and stuff
like<00:01:37.600> that<00:01:37.840> and<00:01:38.140> so<00:01:38.799> I'm<00:01:39.369> not<00:01:39.549> I'm<00:01:39.880> not<00:01:40.119> used<00:01:40.420> to

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:40.600 
like that and so I'm not I'm not used to

00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:44.130 
like that and so I'm not I'm not used to
this<00:01:41.109> so<00:01:41.799> I<00:01:42.039> need<00:01:42.219> to<00:01:42.460> improve<00:01:42.700> this<00:01:43.240> wandered

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:44.140 
this so I need to improve this wandered

00:01:44.140 --> 00:01:47.279 
this so I need to improve this wandered
by<00:01:44.319> 100<00:01:44.859> international<00:01:45.850> ice<00:01:46.030> do<00:01:46.929> you<00:01:47.020> feel

00:01:47.279 --> 00:01:47.289 
by 100 international ice do you feel

00:01:47.289 --> 00:01:49.169 
by 100 international ice do you feel
that<00:01:47.439> you're<00:01:47.740> you're<00:01:48.130> more<00:01:48.369> effective<00:01:48.670> on<00:01:49.030> the

00:01:49.169 --> 00:01:49.179 
that you're you're more effective on the

00:01:49.179 --> 00:01:54.539 
that you're you're more effective on the
smaller<00:01:49.509> ice<00:01:50.249> yeah<00:01:51.249> I<00:01:51.280> think<00:01:51.490> so<00:01:51.850> I<00:01:52.799> can

00:01:54.539 --> 00:01:54.549 
smaller ice yeah I think so I can

00:01:54.549 --> 00:01:56.730 
smaller ice yeah I think so I can
easier<00:01:55.119> to<00:01:55.180> join<00:01:55.420> the<00:01:55.600> Russian<00:01:55.810> three<00:01:56.500> or<00:01:56.590> four

00:01:56.730 --> 00:01:56.740 
easier to join the Russian three or four

00:01:56.740 --> 00:02:10.139 
easier to join the Russian three or four
more<00:01:56.920> for<00:01:57.310> Martha<00:02:08.520> basically<00:02:09.520> a<00:02:09.550> great<00:02:09.880> start

00:02:10.139 --> 00:02:10.149 
more for Martha basically a great start

00:02:10.149 --> 00:02:11.400 
more for Martha basically a great start
for<00:02:10.239> the<00:02:10.330> season<00:02:10.509> then<00:02:10.899> he<00:02:10.989> had<00:02:11.080> a<00:02:11.110> little<00:02:11.230> bit

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:11.410 
for the season then he had a little bit

00:02:11.410 --> 00:02:14.520 
for the season then he had a little bit
of<00:02:11.470> a<00:02:11.530> dip<00:02:11.769> and<00:02:12.310> that's<00:02:12.430> a<00:02:12.690> no<00:02:13.690> -<00:02:14.080> I'm<00:02:14.500> not
