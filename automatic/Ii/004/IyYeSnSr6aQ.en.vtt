00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:43.520
 very nice 

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:50.140
 roberto crias turtles 18 years ago 

00:00:47.440 --> 00:00:52.629
 today it has three thousand 

00:00:50.140 --> 00:00:54.970
 turtles live in a pond with 

00:00:52.629 --> 00:00:58.150
 good quality and are fed with 

00:00:54.970 --> 00:00:59.080
 well cared for they reproduce 

00:00:58.150 --> 00:01:01.780
 more 

00:00:59.080 --> 00:01:03.900
 each female boots an average of ten eggs per 

00:01:01.780 --> 00:01:06.490
 turn 

00:01:03.900 --> 00:01:09.280
 the sheep are taken to a 

00:01:06.490 --> 00:01:12.130
 temperature controlled incubator 

00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:14.590
 stay here for at least two months is a 

00:01:12.130 --> 00:01:16.090
 process slow the screen to get rid of 

00:01:14.590 --> 00:01:19.149
 eggshells 

00:01:16.090 --> 00:01:22.979
 but when they finally do it is a 

00:01:19.149 --> 00:01:22.979
 beautiful scene to come 

00:01:23.830 --> 00:01:28.030
 After the turtles are born, I came to 

00:01:26.470 --> 00:01:30.220
 this space here 

00:01:28.030 --> 00:01:32.860
 they take an average of 15 days to 

00:01:30.220 --> 00:01:36.100
 rest and to develop more 

00:01:32.860 --> 00:01:39.670
 then it can already be marketed 

00:01:36.100 --> 00:01:42.280
 every year 8000 turtles like this 

00:01:39.670 --> 00:01:45.160
 are sold all over Brazil 

00:01:42.280 --> 00:01:46.600
 each one costs for the pet shop shops 

00:01:45.160 --> 00:01:49.480
 90 reais 

00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:52.120
 a business and so much for modesty he is the 

00:01:49.480 --> 00:01:55.180
 the only legalized breeder of the species in the 

00:01:52.120 --> 00:01:56.680
 ibama in 2000 and 2002 he not only 

00:01:55.180 --> 00:01:59.320
 ordinance prohibiting new breeders and 

00:01:56.680 --> 00:02:01.300
 reptiles which gave the condition that people 

00:01:59.320 --> 00:02:03.340
 which have already been registered and 

00:02:01.300 --> 00:02:05.260
 others can not anymore 

00:02:03.340 --> 00:02:07.420
 The total Brazil has suffered delays but it is 

00:02:05.260 --> 00:02:09.190
 a transformation where the competence of the 

00:02:07.420 --> 00:02:10.690
 fame is going through the states that already 

00:02:09.190 --> 00:02:12.340
 is happening here in the parana in 

00:02:10.690 --> 00:02:14.709
 other states são paulo already happened 

00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:16.720
 then all breeding animals 

00:02:14.709 --> 00:02:19.090
 in the country is caught by a 

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:23.380
 2002 that leaves no one 

00:02:19.090 --> 00:02:26.110
 produce and actually gives a one domain 

00:02:23.380 --> 00:02:28.330
 market for those who already have and if you 

00:02:26.110 --> 00:02:30.910
 liked the idea of having a turtle in 

00:02:28.330 --> 00:02:33.910
 house, remember if they do not 

00:02:30.910 --> 00:02:36.580
 little ones forever does not grow 

00:02:33.910 --> 00:02:39.760
 they are the size of a plate in the 

00:02:36.580 --> 00:02:41.530
 almost no work, no noise 

00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:43.300
 an animal that does not make a mess and you 

00:02:41.530 --> 00:02:45.820
 can keep on keeping it in the ground 

00:02:43.300 --> 00:02:48.310
 small on top of an am room where I 

00:02:45.820 --> 00:02:49.450
 I have the condition to go to a dry place and 

00:02:48.310 --> 00:02:50.950
 is right conversion 

00:02:49.450 --> 00:02:53.620
 then the cost of having a pet 

00:02:50.950 --> 00:02:55.150
 pet that is one of those three anti today 

00:02:53.620 --> 00:02:56.230
 for everyone lives in the city is very 

00:02:55.150 --> 00:02:58.570
 cheap 

00:02:56.230 --> 00:03:03.030
 yet without being very friendly they are very 

00:02:58.570 --> 00:03:04.610
 beautiful are very interesting are 

00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:06.500
 nice 

00:03:04.610 --> 00:03:08.780
 but before you bring a turtle 

00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:12.370
 Send this to home, do not forget 

00:03:08.780 --> 00:03:12.370
 these animals grow
