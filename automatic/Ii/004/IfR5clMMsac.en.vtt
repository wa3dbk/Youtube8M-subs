00:00:06.290 --> 00:00:13.019
 good morning Good afternoon Good night 

00:00:09.719 --> 00:00:15.240
 today day of ambon xxi baby and how you 

00:00:13.019 --> 00:00:20.039
 can see is the special edition boxing 

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:22.500
 from the sky whitaker hd pro nintendo wii 

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:25.080
 this special edition features a miniature 

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:27.359
 ghana dorff that is for those who do not know the 

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:30.119
 main line of the series zelda and algar 

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:33.750
 19 in the visual style of the game and 

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:34.950
 Of course a good first to see the box by 

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:37.200
 out right 

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:40.079
 The illustration is very cool represents the 

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:43.460
 last battle final battle 

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:48.270
 Euclid was linear but I 'm already looking 

00:00:43.460 --> 00:00:50.399
 now it's time to open only that I do not 

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:53.850
 I have the courage to open it because I do not 

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:54.780
 I still have this item is so rare that 

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:57.000
 box 

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:59.160
 it's exclusivity from the gamestop store at 

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:02.010
 united states pre-sale lasted a few 

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:03.030
 days if it lasted it lasted for a 

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:06.060
 I do not remember 

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:07.619
 then it reappeared and ran out soon 

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:09.390
 then again 

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:12.030
 unfortunately it is an item that was born 

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:14.100
 The greatest guilt in this is 

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:17.610
 Nintendo look at the price it costs on 

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:20.040
 ebay now that already sold out price will be 

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:21.900
 That same one is super loud does not exist 

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:24.979
 expectation that nintendo will do 

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:27.270
 A new run is something like that. 

00:01:24.979 --> 00:01:30.900
 bought at the time running to catch 

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:32.729
 by the normal price and now the price goes 

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:34.439
 can even talk how much 

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:37.740
 want of ebay sellers of 

00:01:34.439 --> 00:01:39.630
 free market mercenaries well end but 

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:41.490
 the great culprit there in this story 

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:44.159
 nintendo that could very well have done 

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:45.180
 an item with a larger print run for sale and 

00:01:44.159 --> 00:01:48.060
 be guaranteed 

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:50.030
 could have made a distributed item for 

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:52.259
 all stores not only for the game stop 

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:54.479
 I do not know what kind of contract they 

00:01:52.259 --> 00:01:55.860
 make a game stop that ruined the 

00:01:54.479 --> 00:01:58.259
 launch of their new lawsuit for those who 

00:01:55.860 --> 00:01:59.939
 could not buy time and ruined 

00:01:58.259 --> 00:02:02.100
 also the launch of this edition 

00:01:59.939 --> 00:02:04.829
 limited indian baker hd 

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:06.810
 if there were no such restriction, 

00:02:04.829 --> 00:02:08.550
 to make one more limited edition but 

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:10.950
 with a greater amount of available 

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:12.760
 suddenly and in other stores too 

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:16.360
 available in several stores so we can 

00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:18.040
 buy the days am sending sites 

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:20.049
 easily to Brazil as is the case 

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:22.480
 I play well anyway, but I do not 

00:02:20.049 --> 00:02:25.989
 So you want to blame someone else's fault. 

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:27.760
 nintendo because rare the item is played 

00:02:25.989 --> 00:02:31.060
 the item is then who has it in hand and 

00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:31.989
 want to sell sell at a price you think 

00:02:31.060 --> 00:02:35.140
 better not 

00:02:31.989 --> 00:02:37.000
 and will get a deal of this super rare 

00:02:35.140 --> 00:02:40.870
 now sell for $ 59 

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:42.909
 So patience as you know I do not 

00:02:40.870 --> 00:02:46.989
 I like miniatures I do not like to 

00:02:42.909 --> 00:02:50.049
 little dolls in the collection the taste of 

00:02:46.989 --> 00:02:52.690
 games that comes with art book and grant 

00:02:50.049 --> 00:02:55.959
 I do not like anything besides I like to 

00:02:52.690 --> 00:02:57.489
 book and cd and dvd and also with the 

00:02:55.959 --> 00:03:00.159
 making off too and I think it's cool 

00:02:57.489 --> 00:03:02.440
 now miniatures objects I no longer like 

00:03:00.159 --> 00:03:05.500
 but this one is an exception 

00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:07.930
 is a special issue of zelda and bonn 

00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:11.170
 henzel da nintendo then to me 

00:03:07.930 --> 00:03:13.540
 the value is too big it 's time to stop 

00:03:11.170 --> 00:03:17.919
 and not having a river 

00:03:13.540 --> 00:03:19.629
 I'll open it came when the water stays 

00:03:17.919 --> 00:03:25.260
 that you can not open 

00:03:19.629 --> 00:03:33.099
 right make kneading good 

00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:36.489
 first the game golden shiny cover 

00:03:33.099 --> 00:03:38.500
 very beautiful but unfortunately as I already 

00:03:36.489 --> 00:03:41.919
 I waited as I already know of the river games 

00:03:38.500 --> 00:03:44.440
 it's ridiculously light 

00:03:41.919 --> 00:03:48.599
 it no longer has that weight of a cover with 

00:03:44.440 --> 00:03:51.310
 manual and everything is a very lightweight hood 

00:03:48.599 --> 00:03:53.199
 unfortunately they are using that one 

00:03:51.310 --> 00:03:56.409
 plastic sheeting 

00:03:53.199 --> 00:03:59.049
 here I am today bored in manual if 

00:03:56.409 --> 00:04:06.190
 have a leaflet and this is the 

00:03:59.049 --> 00:04:11.430
 current reality physical media ending up and 

00:04:06.190 --> 00:04:11.430
 here it is clear the statuette do not win 1 do 

00:04:14.060 --> 00:04:46.320
 The celac is very cool, very cool. 

00:04:39.330 --> 00:04:49.350
 very well done a comment that 

00:04:46.320 --> 00:04:50.780
 I would like to make it more legal than 

00:04:49.350 --> 00:04:55.979
 be that 

00:04:50.780 --> 00:05:00.330
 this edition is a pity that besides being 

00:04:55.979 --> 00:05:05.099
 most restricted gamestop only 

00:05:00.330 --> 00:05:07.620
 it is also lower than the European version 

00:05:05.099 --> 00:05:09.630
 for a change is always lower than the version 

00:05:07.620 --> 00:05:14.789
 european american 

00:05:09.630 --> 00:05:16.919
 at least in the case of good zelda 

00:05:14.789 --> 00:05:19.949
 plastic glass case I know not 

00:05:16.919 --> 00:05:22.340
 you put over the channel 9 makes 

00:05:19.949 --> 00:05:23.910
 that the look is much more 

00:05:22.340 --> 00:05:28.800
 collectible nÃ© 

00:05:23.910 --> 00:05:30.630
 but good, how are you? 

00:05:28.800 --> 00:05:34.229
 America always stepping on the ball with 

00:05:30.630 --> 00:05:45.710
 zelda is kind of hard to fit has 

00:05:34.229 --> 00:05:45.710
 afraid to ruin but went here 

00:05:53.180 --> 00:05:57.800
 good tac to ride the figure I stayed in 

00:05:56.120 --> 00:06:00.830
 doubt about these curtains what 

00:05:57.800 --> 00:06:02.539
 put it coiled but it got that way 

00:06:00.830 --> 00:06:06.080
 Because it was like a better fit, I guess. 

00:06:02.539 --> 00:06:10.280
 that's right and good it has marks here 

00:06:06.080 --> 00:06:12.800
 There are a few lines in the neck and 

00:06:10.280 --> 00:06:14.800
 shoulders as if he could be articulated but he 

00:06:12.800 --> 00:06:17.300
 it's not what I saw it's not articulate 

00:06:14.800 --> 00:06:23.060
 be sure to be very handsome 

00:06:17.300 --> 00:06:25.160
 despite this and now I have doubts I 

00:06:23.060 --> 00:06:27.410
 I leave it in the box the sky of 

00:06:25.160 --> 00:06:30.110
 suely thus taking the powder montadinho 

00:06:27.410 --> 00:06:32.270
 I 'll decide later since I opened 

00:06:30.110 --> 00:06:34.400
 the box does not make much sense I do not 

00:06:32.270 --> 00:06:37.130
 I opened the game right now, although I did not have the 

00:06:34.400 --> 00:06:42.070
 But I want to see what the situation is like. 

00:06:37.130 --> 00:06:42.070
 here the manual and everything else 

00:06:46.750 --> 00:07:02.330
 the code of the nintendo club propaganda not 

00:07:00.080 --> 00:07:05.120
 speak the booklet talking about the manual 

00:07:02.330 --> 00:07:09.110
 electronic that little hole of recyclable 

00:07:05.120 --> 00:07:11.300
 in the front that I find detestable and another 

00:07:09.110 --> 00:07:13.669
 That hole I think is testable by 

00:07:11.300 --> 00:07:16.669
 weighing the weight of a pen 

00:07:13.669 --> 00:07:18.650
 crap but that's how games go 

00:07:16.669 --> 00:07:21.080
 to be from now on the trend is only 

00:07:18.650 --> 00:07:23.840
 worsen god collectors I want 

00:07:21.080 --> 00:07:25.849
 understand is saying why nintendo 

00:07:23.840 --> 00:07:28.490
 was the last to make more colorful 

00:07:25.849 --> 00:07:31.009
 in three languages and now it's 

00:07:28.490 --> 00:07:32.930
 failing to do this even by buying 

00:07:31.009 --> 00:07:35.780
 a limited edition boxing collector 

00:07:32.930 --> 00:07:39.349
 You have it here without a printed manual. 

00:07:35.780 --> 00:07:43.070
 I think it's a real good shame. 

00:07:39.349 --> 00:07:43.550
 Also beautiful the disk label is this 

00:07:43.070 --> 00:07:46.250
 there 

00:07:43.550 --> 00:07:48.639
 Thank you all for watching and a 

00:07:46.250 --> 00:07:48.639
 hug
