cameras<00:02:04.930> seeing<00:02:05.170> stupid<00:02:06.130> computer<00:02:06.700> so<00:02:07.420> let's

00:02:08.010 --> 00:02:08.020 
cameras seeing stupid computer so let's

00:02:08.020 --> 00:02:10.590 
cameras seeing stupid computer so let's
try<00:02:08.290> it<00:02:08.350> on<00:02:08.500> something<00:02:08.800> else<00:02:09.130> let's<00:02:10.030> see<00:02:10.300> if<00:02:10.450> we

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:10.600 
try it on something else let's see if we

00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:15.530 
try it on something else let's see if we
can<00:02:10.780> get<00:02:10.899> it<00:02:11.050> up<00:02:11.200> on<00:02:11.440> you<00:02:11.740> need<00:02:12.010> video<00:02:12.280> studio

00:03:29.620 --> 00:03:29.630 
and now I need to do this I don't know

00:03:29.630 --> 00:03:34.090 
and now I need to do this I don't know
what<00:03:29.750> the<00:03:29.900> hell<00:03:30.050> I'm<00:03:30.170> doing<00:03:32.440> so<00:03:33.440> let's<00:03:33.680> just<00:03:33.890> do

00:03:34.090 --> 00:03:34.100 
what the hell I'm doing so let's just do

00:03:34.100 --> 00:03:43.090 
what the hell I'm doing so let's just do
this<00:03:34.310> anyway<00:03:34.760> and<00:03:34.880> see<00:03:35.030> what<00:03:35.210> happens

00:03:43.090 --> 00:03:43.100 

00:03:43.100 --> 00:03:46.170 

and<00:03:43.190> it's<00:03:43.940> not<00:03:44.090> doing<00:03:44.450> anything<00:03:44.690> at<00:03:44.930> all<00:03:45.080> I

00:03:46.170 --> 00:03:46.180 
and it's not doing anything at all I

00:03:46.180 --> 00:03:48.490 
and it's not doing anything at all I
think<00:03:47.180> it<00:03:47.330> stopped<00:03:47.660> responding<00:03:48.080> for

00:03:48.490 --> 00:03:48.500 
think it stopped responding for

00:03:48.500 --> 00:03:52.540 
think it stopped responding for
absolutely<00:03:49.100> no<00:03:49.370> reason<00:03:49.400> whatsoever<00:03:51.190> so<00:03:52.190> we'd

00:03:52.540 --> 00:03:52.550 
absolutely no reason whatsoever so we'd

00:03:52.550 --> 00:03:53.980 
absolutely no reason whatsoever so we'd
better<00:03:52.790> get<00:03:52.970> out<00:03:53.150> of<00:03:53.240> this<00:03:53.360> program<00:03:53.690> before

00:03:53.980 --> 00:03:53.990 
better get out of this program before

00:03:53.990 --> 00:03:56.320 
better get out of this program before
something<00:03:54.410> else<00:03:54.650> happens<00:03:54.910> I'll<00:03:55.910> just<00:03:56.120> press

00:03:56.320 --> 00:03:56.330 
something else happens I'll just press

00:03:56.330 --> 00:03:58.210 
something else happens I'll just press
those<00:03:56.600> three<00:03:57.080> famous<00:03:57.470> buttons<00:03:58.010> it's

00:03:58.210 --> 00:03:58.220 
those three famous buttons it's

00:03:58.220 --> 00:03:59.890 
those three famous buttons it's
difficult<00:03:58.640> to<00:03:58.790> do<00:03:58.970> this<00:03:59.120> and<00:03:59.360> hold<00:03:59.540> the<00:03:59.660> camera

00:03:59.890 --> 00:03:59.900 
difficult to do this and hold the camera

00:03:59.900 --> 00:04:03.010 
difficult to do this and hold the camera
at<00:04:00.050> the<00:04:00.140> same<00:04:00.350> time<00:04:01.570> control-alt-delete<00:04:02.570> to

00:04:03.010 --> 00:04:03.020 
at the same time control-alt-delete to

00:04:03.020 --> 00:04:05.170 
at the same time control-alt-delete to
bring<00:04:03.230> up<00:04:03.380> the<00:04:03.830> useless<00:04:04.400> windows<00:04:04.820> task

00:04:05.170 --> 00:04:05.180 
bring up the useless windows task

00:04:05.180 --> 00:04:10.390 
bring up the useless windows task
manager<00:04:05.800> and<00:04:07.690> look<00:04:08.690> I<00:04:08.840> was<00:04:09.200> right<00:04:09.440> it<00:04:10.190> has

00:04:10.390 --> 00:04:10.400 
manager and look I was right it has

00:04:10.400 --> 00:04:19.180 
manager and look I was right it has
stopped<00:04:10.670> responding<00:04:12.460> so<00:04:13.460> we're<00:04:14.390> to<00:04:14.510> end<00:04:14.690> it<00:04:18.190> as

00:04:19.180 --> 00:04:19.190 
stopped responding so we're to end it as

00:04:19.190 --> 00:04:21.970 
stopped responding so we're to end it as
you<00:04:19.310> can<00:04:19.430> see<00:04:19.640> the<00:04:19.940> thing<00:04:20.120> appears<00:04:20.450> so<00:04:21.320> ends

00:04:21.970 --> 00:04:21.980 
you can see the thing appears so ends

00:04:21.980 --> 00:04:27.100 
you can see the thing appears so ends
now<00:04:22.510> and<00:04:23.510> look<00:04:23.720> it's<00:04:24.170> still<00:04:25.130> running<00:04:26.110> what's

00:04:27.100 --> 00:04:27.110

00:04:40.550 --> 00:04:42.190 
up with that why won't you end looking
at<00:04:40.790> this<00:04:40.940> you<00:04:41.150> can<00:04:41.300> tell<00:04:41.510> us<00:04:41.540> not<00:04:41.840> doing

00:04:42.190 --> 00:04:42.200 
at this you can tell us not doing

00:04:42.200 --> 00:04:47.950 
at this you can tell us not doing
anything<00:04:45.250> it<00:04:46.250> looks<00:04:46.520> like<00:04:46.760> we<00:04:47.030> need<00:04:47.270> to<00:04:47.510> reboot

00:04:47.950 --> 00:04:47.960

back on my hard drive so let's try to

00:05:33.030 --> 00:05:38.570 
back on my hard drive so let's try to
copy<00:05:33.240> one

00:05:38.570 --> 00:05:38.580 

00:05:38.580 --> 00:05:42.529 

we'll<00:05:39.030> put<00:05:39.240> it<00:05:39.360> right<00:05:39.599> there<00:05:40.069> as<00:05:41.210> you<00:05:42.210> can<00:05:42.360> see

00:05:46.129 --> 00:05:46.139 
it's copying it now seems been on 25

00:05:46.139 --> 00:05:57.910 
it's copying it now seems been on 25
seconds<00:05:46.949> for<00:05:47.159> about<00:05:47.430> five<00:05:47.789> minutes<00:05:48.090> now

00:05:57.910 --> 00:05:57.920 

00:05:57.920 --> 00:06:00.100
