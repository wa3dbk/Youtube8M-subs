00:00:02.700 --> 00:00:05.700
 ah 

00:00:05.730 --> 00:00:11.070
 for more than 2000 years the minds most 

00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:13.260
 wonders of the world have been seen 

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:15.570
 overcome by a mathematical puzzle without 

00:00:13.260 --> 00:00:17.400
 paragon is about such a problem 

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:21.320
 difficult to torment those 

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:21.320
 mathematicians who used to solve it 

00:00:22.240 --> 00:00:25.550
 what is the holy grail of 

00:00:23.860 --> 00:00:27.259
 maths 

00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:29.060
 he is mystery that takes centuries 

00:00:27.259 --> 00:00:32.460
 tormenting mathematicians of everything 

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:35.070
 the world is the prime numbers 

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:36.629
 if we imagine the numbers in a row 

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:38.850
 the feeling that cousins ​​are 

00:00:36.629 --> 00:00:41.210
 placed randomly it seems that no 

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:44.040
 pattern explains how they are distributed 

00:00:41.210 --> 00:00:45.660
 for centuries mathematicians of all the 

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:48.239
 world have tried to find some 

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:51.120
 sense to these crazy numbers in the 

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:52.409
 19th century the German mathematician bernard 

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:55.470
 riemann made a discovery 

00:00:52.409 --> 00:00:57.600
 crucial he built a mathematical landscape 

00:00:55.470 --> 00:00:58.920
 as a three-dimensional graphic and 

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:00.720
 discovered that the points that were 

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:03.329
 they found the equivalent to the level of 

00:01:00.720 --> 00:01:04.979
 The so-called zero points were the 

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:08.070
 that hid secrets of numbers 

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:09.630
 cousins the touring approach unlike 

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:13.140
 of the other mathematicians in two 

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:14.970
 vital aspects the first one that started 

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:17.440
 consider that the Riemann hypothesis 

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:20.080
 out really fake 

00:01:17.440 --> 00:01:22.150
 and the second one that decided to prove that 

00:01:20.080 --> 00:01:24.460
 it was false with a tactic completely 

00:01:22.150 --> 00:01:26.940
 revolutionary turin built a 

00:01:24.460 --> 00:01:26.940
 machine 

00:01:27.970 --> 00:01:32.710
 that machine would explore the landscape 

00:01:30.400 --> 00:01:34.570
 three-dimensional riemann trying 

00:01:32.710 --> 00:01:36.850
 prove that the hypothesis was false 

00:01:34.570 --> 00:01:39.730
 for this I would look for zero points that 

00:01:36.850 --> 00:01:41.830
 were out of line at the end 

00:01:39.730 --> 00:01:43.270
 thirties the room 

00:01:41.830 --> 00:01:45.130
 I had touring in cambridge there was 

00:01:43.270 --> 00:01:47.740
 disappeared under numerous wheels and 

00:01:45.130 --> 00:01:50.350
 gear devices but the war 

00:01:47.740 --> 00:01:52.150
 He interrupted his work was then 

00:01:50.350 --> 00:01:54.430
 when they assigned it to plate li park 

00:01:52.150 --> 00:01:56.350
 although he had not managed to finish the 

00:01:54.430 --> 00:01:58.690
 machine the work that had been 

00:01:56.350 --> 00:02:00.670
 made to form the foundations of the 

00:01:58.690 --> 00:02:04.060
 new machine that if they manage to decipher 

00:02:00.670 --> 00:02:06.130
 secret enemy codes the machine 

00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:07.990
 turing achieved a worldwide success reduced 

00:02:06.130 --> 00:02:10.690
 the duration of the war in at least two 

00:02:07.990 --> 00:02:12.190
 years and saved numerous lives does not have 

00:02:10.690 --> 00:02:13.810
 that always last too much if 

00:02:12.190 --> 00:02:15.340
 we affirmed that the work he had to 

00:02:13.810 --> 00:02:17.200
 had performed on the machine 

00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:18.940
 Griezmann before the war was what 

00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:21.300
 facilitated the end the victory over the 

00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:21.300
 nazis 

00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:28.349
 after the war touring followed 

00:02:26.550 --> 00:02:30.810
 using machines to solve problems 

00:02:28.349 --> 00:02:32.790
 but his experience in blakely taught him 

00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:34.739
 that would be much more useful with one that 

00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:37.250
 could schedule to perform more than 

00:02:34.739 --> 00:02:37.250
 a task 

00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:42.519
 with cathode ray tubes and drums 

00:02:39.909 --> 00:02:44.780
 magnetic turin created the prototype of 

00:02:42.519 --> 00:02:46.970
 modern computer 

00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:48.890
 one of the first missions in which 

00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:51.500
 he embarked touring with his computer 

00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:53.600
 was to look for the zeros of rivas and 

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:56.060
 obviously he found that all 

00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:58.250
 they were on that straight line the 

00:02:56.060 --> 00:03:01.069
 new touring machine managed to locate 

00:02:58.250 --> 00:03:03.680
 the first thousand 104 zeros all of them 

00:03:01.069 --> 00:03:05.150
 on the line and then you break some 

00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:07.010
 great discoveries to the 

00:03:05.150 --> 00:03:08.630
 mathematicians still resist one 

00:03:07.010 --> 00:03:10.670
 rope that demonstrates the hypothesis of 

00:03:08.630 --> 00:03:12.590
 riemann the prime numbers keep their 

00:03:10.670 --> 00:03:14.569
 mystic halo until a few years ago 

00:03:12.590 --> 00:03:16.670
 only the mathematicians seemed 

00:03:14.569 --> 00:03:18.680
 really interested in these numbers 

00:03:16.670 --> 00:03:19.880
 mysterious but a change of parents of 

00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:21.920
 last minute with what the numbers 

00:03:19.880 --> 00:03:23.600
 cousins ​​in the central axis of a world 

00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:26.170
 minimum your organization 

00:03:23.600 --> 00:03:26.170
 electronics 

00:03:34.810 --> 00:03:39.280
 every time we make a transaction 

00:03:37.030 --> 00:03:41.050
 online we are using prime numbers 

00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:43.480
 to encode the details of our 

00:03:41.050 --> 00:03:45.610
 credit card 

00:03:43.480 --> 00:03:47.319
 the security of the system is based on the 

00:03:45.610 --> 00:03:48.640
 difficulty that involves shredding a 

00:03:47.319 --> 00:03:51.269
 number up cousins ​​that what 

00:03:48.640 --> 00:03:51.269
 they constitute 

00:03:55.850 --> 00:04:00.130
 I'm going to show you how it works with a 

00:03:57.980 --> 00:04:02.350
 little paint 

00:04:00.130 --> 00:04:04.830
 imagine that each color represents a 

00:04:02.350 --> 00:04:04.830
 Prime number 

00:04:06.740 --> 00:04:10.580
 if after I mix the two colors as 

00:04:09.140 --> 00:04:12.680
 if I were multiplying the two 

00:04:10.580 --> 00:04:14.630
 prime numbers I get a color 

00:04:12.680 --> 00:04:17.770
 completely different a number 

00:04:14.630 --> 00:04:17.770
 completely new 

00:04:18.700 --> 00:04:23.230
 this number is used to encode the 

00:04:20.860 --> 00:04:25.390
 cloud the credit card but the 

00:04:23.230 --> 00:04:29.310
 only way to decode it goes through 

00:04:25.390 --> 00:04:29.310
 know the prime numbers that compose it 

00:04:29.729 --> 00:04:35.139
 it is very difficult to separate the colors 

00:04:33.060 --> 00:04:37.389
 it is also extremely difficult 

00:04:35.139 --> 00:04:39.669
 calculate guys and the cousins ​​created the 

00:04:37.389 --> 00:04:41.380
 codified counted the two cousins 

00:04:39.669 --> 00:04:43.150
 originals is practically impossible 

00:04:41.380 --> 00:04:45.600
 find out the card number 

00:04:43.150 --> 00:04:45.600
 credit 

00:04:47.680 --> 00:04:51.699
 the system is completely safe 

00:04:49.810 --> 00:04:54.039
 because we still do not understand the numbers 

00:04:51.699 --> 00:04:56.560
 cousins if we could prove the 

00:04:54.039 --> 00:04:58.060
 Riemann hypothesis we would learn a lot 

00:04:56.560 --> 00:05:00.720
 more about the behavior of 

00:04:58.060 --> 00:05:02.790
 Prime numbers 

00:05:00.720 --> 00:05:04.140
 maybe we would even be able to 

00:05:02.790 --> 00:05:06.120
 find out the prime numbers that 

00:05:04.140 --> 00:05:08.040
 make very high figures a 

00:05:06.120 --> 00:05:09.840
 discovery of that type would collapse the 

00:05:08.040 --> 00:05:12.040
 electronic financial system level 

00:05:09.840 --> 00:05:14.710
 world 

00:05:12.040 --> 00:05:16.690
 it is therefore not surprising that 

00:05:14.710 --> 00:05:18.550
 an employer has stipulated a 

00:05:16.690 --> 00:05:20.440
 reward of one million dollars for 

00:05:18.550 --> 00:05:22.900
 who can decipher the hypothesis of 

00:05:20.440 --> 00:05:24.790
 riemann but mathematicians do not 

00:05:22.900 --> 00:05:26.530
 interest money the solution to that 

00:05:24.790 --> 00:05:28.030
 hypothesis tends with consequences so 

00:05:26.530 --> 00:05:30.460
 interesting for the field of 

00:05:28.030 --> 00:05:32.790
 magnetic than most of your soul for 

00:05:30.460 --> 00:05:32.790
 a new 

00:05:33.090 --> 00:05:37.620
 the riemann hypothesis is one of those 

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:39.360
 hypothesis that at the time the 

00:05:37.620 --> 00:05:42.410
 you understand completely changes the 

00:05:39.360 --> 00:05:42.410
 mathematical panorama 

00:05:44.800 --> 00:05:50.520
 there are many fields at the moment 

00:05:48.610 --> 00:05:53.270
 of mathematics 

00:05:50.520 --> 00:05:57.210
 that depend on the Riemann hypothesis 

00:05:53.270 --> 00:05:59.690
 three thousand years later the cousins ​​followed 

00:05:57.210 --> 00:06:01.710
 rotating generations of mathematicians 

00:05:59.690 --> 00:06:03.240
 I personally believe that despite the 

00:06:01.710 --> 00:06:05.460
 exciting connections that have 

00:06:03.240 --> 00:06:08.190
 found with the cryptography physics 

00:06:05.460 --> 00:06:09.479
 and computers to mathematicians yet 

00:06:08.190 --> 00:06:11.580
 they have a lot left to find 

00:06:09.479 --> 00:06:12.930
 final result a result that could 

00:06:11.580 --> 00:06:15.030
 arrive at any time and in 

00:06:12.930 --> 00:06:16.620
 anywhere but what I'm sure 

00:06:15.030 --> 00:06:19.139
 is that almost not what what showed 

00:06:16.620 --> 00:06:21.060
 the riemann hypothesis will be remembered 

00:06:19.139 --> 00:06:24.500
 forever as the mathematician who did 

00:06:21.060 --> 00:06:24.500
 sing the same cousins
