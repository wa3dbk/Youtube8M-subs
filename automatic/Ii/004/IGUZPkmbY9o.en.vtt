00:00:29.330 --> 00:00:29.340 
winter time is no exception but let's

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:33.830 
winter time is no exception but let's
say<00:00:29.490> we've<00:00:29.699> run<00:00:29.880> out<00:00:30.000> of<00:00:30.029> water<00:00:32.809> we<00:00:33.809> should

00:00:33.830 --> 00:00:33.840 
say we've run out of water we should

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:35.150 
say we've run out of water we should
always<00:00:34.140> have<00:00:34.290> some<00:00:34.649> kind<00:00:34.770> of<00:00:34.890> little<00:00:35.130> metal

00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:35.160

00:00:40.119 --> 00:00:40.129 
but let's say we didn't even have that

00:00:40.129 --> 00:00:43.040 
but let's say we didn't even have that
people<00:00:41.129> have<00:00:41.250> trash<00:00:41.550> everywhere<00:00:42.030> we<00:00:42.780> can<00:00:42.870> just

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:43.050 
people have trash everywhere we can just

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:46.790 
people have trash everywhere we can just
take<00:00:43.230> a<00:00:43.410> simple<00:00:43.739> aluminum<00:00:44.219> can<00:00:44.670> and<00:00:45.770> with<00:00:46.770> a

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:46.800 
take a simple aluminum can and with a

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:49.010 
take a simple aluminum can and with a
knife<00:00:47.039> we<00:00:47.399> can<00:00:47.550> cut<00:00:47.730> the<00:00:47.879> top<00:00:48.030> off<00:00:48.329> and<00:00:48.570> turn<00:00:48.870> it

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:49.020 
knife we can cut the top off and turn it

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:51.430 
knife we can cut the top off and turn it
into<00:00:49.170> not<00:00:49.469> only<00:00:49.500> a<00:00:49.710> drinking<00:00:50.129> vessel<00:00:50.180> but<00:00:51.180> a

00:00:51.430 --> 00:00:51.440 
into not only a drinking vessel but a

00:00:51.440 --> 00:00:54.920 
into not only a drinking vessel but a
pot<00:00:52.440> to<00:00:52.860> boil<00:00:53.070> water<00:00:53.340> in<00:00:53.520> now<00:00:54.449> if<00:00:54.570> the<00:00:54.690> snow<00:00:54.899> is

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:54.930 
pot to boil water in now if the snow is

00:00:54.930 --> 00:01:00.529 
pot to boil water in now if the snow is
fresh<00:00:57.920> we<00:00:58.920> could<00:00:59.100> scoop<00:00:59.370> it<00:00:59.489> up<00:00:59.640> and<00:00:59.820> melt<00:01:00.329> it

00:01:00.529 --> 00:01:00.539 
fresh we could scoop it up and melt it

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:04.429 
fresh we could scoop it up and melt it
and<00:01:01.460> have<00:01:02.460> some<00:01:02.850> safety<00:01:03.239> in<00:01:03.600> drinking<00:01:04.140> it<00:01:04.290> as

00:01:04.429 --> 00:01:04.439 
and have some safety in drinking it as

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:07.850 
and have some safety in drinking it as
is<00:01:04.850> but<00:01:05.850> it's<00:01:06.030> always<00:01:06.390> best<00:01:06.720> to<00:01:07.200> actually<00:01:07.409> go

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:07.860 
is but it's always best to actually go

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:10.190 
is but it's always best to actually go
ahead<00:01:07.979> and<00:01:08.369> boil<00:01:08.760> the<00:01:09.000> snow<00:01:09.240> if<00:01:09.510> you're<00:01:10.020> going

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:10.200 
ahead and boil the snow if you're going

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:12.530 
ahead and boil the snow if you're going
to<00:01:10.380> have<00:01:10.560> to<00:01:10.740> make<00:01:10.890> a<00:01:10.920> fire<00:01:11.250> to<00:01:11.490> melt<00:01:11.700> it<00:01:11.909> you

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:12.540 
to have to make a fire to melt it you

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:15.789 
to have to make a fire to melt it you
might<00:01:12.750> as<00:01:12.869> well<00:01:12.930> boil<00:01:13.290> it<00:01:13.500> to<00:01:13.619> ensure<00:01:13.920> safety

00:01:15.789 --> 00:01:15.799 
might as well boil it to ensure safety

00:01:15.799 --> 00:01:17.870 
might as well boil it to ensure safety
so<00:01:16.799> now<00:01:16.979> that<00:01:17.040> we've<00:01:17.220> got<00:01:17.369> a<00:01:17.400> little<00:01:17.670> fire

00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:17.880 
so now that we've got a little fire

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:20.539 
so now that we've got a little fire
going<00:01:18.240> out<00:01:18.420> here<00:01:18.799> we're<00:01:19.799> gonna<00:01:19.920> take<00:01:20.159> our<00:01:20.310> can

00:01:20.539 --> 00:01:20.549 
going out here we're gonna take our can

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:24.020 
going out here we're gonna take our can
and<00:01:21.590> place<00:01:22.590> it<00:01:22.770> next<00:01:22.979> to<00:01:23.130> the<00:01:23.250> fire<00:01:23.520> we<00:01:23.850> don't

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:24.030 
and place it next to the fire we don't

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:25.429 
and place it next to the fire we don't
want<00:01:24.150> to<00:01:24.210> place<00:01:24.390> it<00:01:24.570> over<00:01:24.689> the<00:01:24.869> fire<00:01:25.140> because

00:01:25.429 --> 00:01:25.439 
want to place it over the fire because

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:28.730 
want to place it over the fire because
aluminum<00:01:25.770> can<00:01:26.189> melt<00:01:26.460> in<00:01:27.210> a<00:01:27.530> significant<00:01:28.530> sized

00:01:28.730 --> 00:01:28.740 
aluminum can melt in a significant sized

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:31.280 
aluminum can melt in a significant sized
campfire<00:01:29.520> so<00:01:30.060> very<00:01:30.240> quickly<00:01:30.540> the<00:01:30.840> snow<00:01:30.900> will

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:31.290 
campfire so very quickly the snow will

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:33.710 
campfire so very quickly the snow will
start<00:01:31.530> to<00:01:31.650> melt<00:01:31.890> in<00:01:32.130> the<00:01:32.369> cup<00:01:32.579> now<00:01:33.360> we<00:01:33.420> will

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:33.720 
start to melt in the cup now we will

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:36.530 
start to melt in the cup now we will
need<00:01:33.840> 10<00:01:34.200> cups<00:01:34.590> of<00:01:34.860> snow<00:01:35.189> to<00:01:35.610> equal<00:01:35.939> one<00:01:36.240> cup

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:36.540 
need 10 cups of snow to equal one cup

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:38.929 
need 10 cups of snow to equal one cup
full<00:01:36.720> of<00:01:36.780> water<00:01:37.140> so<00:01:37.409> we<00:01:38.009> simply<00:01:38.369> leave<00:01:38.579> the<00:01:38.729> cup

00:01:38.929 --> 00:01:38.939 
full of water so we simply leave the cup

00:01:38.939 --> 00:01:41.660 
full of water so we simply leave the cup
there<00:01:39.210> and<00:01:39.740> continue<00:01:40.740> to<00:01:40.860> add<00:01:40.979> snow<00:01:41.340> to<00:01:41.400> it

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:41.670 
there and continue to add snow to it

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:43.999 
there and continue to add snow to it
until<00:01:42.030> we<00:01:42.150> have<00:01:42.329> it<00:01:42.450> full<00:01:42.659> of<00:01:42.689> water<00:01:42.810> as<00:01:43.770> soon

00:01:43.999 --> 00:01:44.009 
until we have it full of water as soon

00:01:44.009 --> 00:01:45.620 
until we have it full of water as soon
as<00:01:44.100> this<00:01:44.220> cup<00:01:44.490> starts<00:01:44.790> to<00:01:44.909> boil<00:01:45.060> with<00:01:45.390> big

00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:45.630 
as this cup starts to boil with big

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:47.330 
as this cup starts to boil with big
bubbles<00:01:46.020> rising<00:01:46.439> all<00:01:46.649> the<00:01:46.920> way<00:01:47.009> from<00:01:47.189> the

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:47.340 
bubbles rising all the way from the

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:50.389 
bubbles rising all the way from the
bottom<00:01:47.490> to<00:01:48.030> the<00:01:48.149> top<00:01:48.180> of<00:01:48.570> the<00:01:48.930> vessel<00:01:49.110> then<00:01:50.100> we

00:01:50.389 --> 00:01:50.399 
bottom to the top of the vessel then we

00:01:50.399 --> 00:01:54.679 
bottom to the top of the vessel then we
start<00:01:50.640> our<00:01:50.729> count<00:01:51.000> of<00:01:51.240> 10<00:01:52.110> minutes<00:01:53.390> after<00:01:54.390> 10

00:01:54.679 --> 00:01:54.689 
start our count of 10 minutes after 10

00:01:54.689 --> 00:01:57.109 
start our count of 10 minutes after 10
minutes<00:01:55.110> we<00:01:55.409> let<00:01:55.680> the<00:01:55.860> water<00:01:56.280> cool<00:01:56.520> down<00:01:56.790> to<00:01:57.090> a

00:01:57.109 --> 00:01:57.119 
minutes we let the water cool down to a

00:01:57.119 --> 00:01:59.230 
minutes we let the water cool down to a
safe<00:01:57.360> temperature<00:01:57.600> and<00:01:58.049> then<00:01:58.439> we<00:01:58.530> drink<00:01:58.799> it

00:01:59.230 --> 00:01:59.240 
safe temperature and then we drink it

00:01:59.240 --> 00:02:02.090 
safe temperature and then we drink it
now<00:02:00.240> it's<00:02:00.390> not<00:02:00.540> exactly<00:02:01.320> what<00:02:01.560> you<00:02:01.680> want<00:02:01.860> to<00:02:01.950> do

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:02.100 
now it's not exactly what you want to do

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:04.580 
now it's not exactly what you want to do
in<00:02:02.340> the<00:02:02.850> outdoors<00:02:03.270> in<00:02:03.450> the<00:02:03.479> winter<00:02:03.659> time<00:02:03.930> to

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:04.590 
in the outdoors in the winter time to

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:06.560 
in the outdoors in the winter time to
drink<00:02:04.860> a<00:02:04.950> lot<00:02:05.130> of<00:02:05.159> water<00:02:05.670> especially<00:02:06.030> if<00:02:06.420> it's

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:06.570 
drink a lot of water especially if it's

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:08.630 
drink a lot of water especially if it's
cold<00:02:06.869> but<00:02:07.590> it's<00:02:07.649> very<00:02:07.920> important<00:02:08.399> to<00:02:08.429> stay

00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:08.640 
cold but it's very important to stay

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:10.729 
cold but it's very important to stay
hydrated<00:02:08.879> in<00:02:09.390> the<00:02:09.509> outdoors<00:02:09.929> your<00:02:10.530> body

00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:10.739 
hydrated in the outdoors your body

00:02:10.739 --> 00:02:12.710 
hydrated in the outdoors your body
cannot<00:02:11.069> stay<00:02:11.310> warm<00:02:11.640> if<00:02:11.879> you<00:02:12.000> are<00:02:12.090> not<00:02:12.300> properly

00:02:12.710 --> 00:02:12.720 
cannot stay warm if you are not properly

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:13.150 
cannot stay warm if you are not properly
hide

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:13.160 
hide

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:15.910 
hide
so<00:02:13.940> even<00:02:14.150> drinking<00:02:14.540> cold<00:02:14.840> water<00:02:14.930> is<00:02:15.440> better

00:02:15.910 --> 00:02:15.920 
so even drinking cold water is better

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:19.450 
so even drinking cold water is better
than<00:02:16.190> drinking<00:02:16.370> no<00:02:16.700> water<00:02:17.440> the<00:02:18.440> best<00:02:18.710> gauge<00:02:19.070> of

00:02:19.450 --> 00:02:19.460 
than drinking no water the best gauge of

00:02:19.460 --> 00:02:21.460 
than drinking no water the best gauge of
telling<00:02:20.060> if<00:02:20.180> you're<00:02:20.300> hydrated<00:02:20.840> or<00:02:20.960> not<00:02:21.110> in<00:02:21.350> the

telling if you're hydrated or not in the
wintertime<00:02:21.740> is<00:02:22.270> your<00:02:23.270> urine<00:02:23.480> output<00:02:23.990> if

00:02:24.730 --> 00:02:24.740 
wintertime is your urine output if

00:02:24.740 --> 00:02:26.530 
wintertime is your urine output if
you're<00:02:24.980> not<00:02:25.130> peeing<00:02:25.400> every<00:02:25.760> couple<00:02:26.060> of<00:02:26.180> hours

00:02:26.530 --> 00:02:26.540 
you're not peeing every couple of hours

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:30.280 
you're not peeing every couple of hours
you<00:02:26.840> should<00:02:26.870> be<00:02:27.430> if<00:02:28.430> your<00:02:29.180> urine<00:02:29.510> when<00:02:29.990> you<00:02:30.080> do

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:30.290 
you should be if your urine when you do

you should be if your urine when you do
pee<00:02:30.530> appears<00:02:31.130> to<00:02:31.280> be<00:02:31.400> dark<00:02:31.730> yellow<00:02:32.300> or<00:02:32.510> even

00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:32.930 
pee appears to be dark yellow or even

00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:35.170 
pee appears to be dark yellow or even
orange<00:02:33.290> that's<00:02:33.710> a<00:02:33.950> solid<00:02:34.400> sign<00:02:34.640> that<00:02:34.910> you<00:02:35.060> are

00:02:35.170 --> 00:02:35.180 
orange that's a solid sign that you are

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:37.450 
orange that's a solid sign that you are
not<00:02:35.420> drinking<00:02:35.870> enough<00:02:36.140> your<00:02:36.830> urine<00:02:37.130> should<00:02:37.340> be

00:02:37.450 --> 00:02:37.460 
not drinking enough your urine should be

00:02:37.460 --> 00:02:40.180 
not drinking enough your urine should be
fairly<00:02:37.880> light<00:02:38.240> in<00:02:38.480> color<00:02:38.780> and<00:02:39.020> of<00:02:39.740> course<00:02:39.980> with

00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:40.190 
fairly light in color and of course with

00:02:40.190 --> 00:02:42.390 
fairly light in color and of course with
snow<00:02:40.400> on<00:02:40.550> the<00:02:40.640> ground<00:02:40.670> this<00:02:41.330> is<00:02:41.390> easy<00:02:41.720> to<00:02:41.930> tell

00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:42.400 
snow on the ground this is easy to tell

00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:45.420 
snow on the ground this is easy to tell
so<00:02:43.400> if<00:02:43.610> our<00:02:43.760> urine<00:02:44.150> is<00:02:44.270> too<00:02:44.450> dark<00:02:44.690> or

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:45.430 
so if our urine is too dark or

00:02:45.430 --> 00:02:48.250 
so if our urine is too dark or
infrequent<00:02:46.480> we<00:02:47.480> want<00:02:47.690> to<00:02:47.810> drink<00:02:48.050> more<00:02:48.200> water

00:02:48.250 --> 00:02:48.260 
infrequent we want to drink more water

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:52.510 
infrequent we want to drink more water
now<00:02:50.020> in<00:02:51.020> our<00:02:51.140> next<00:02:51.530> clip<00:02:51.740> we're<00:02:52.100> going<00:02:52.130> to<00:02:52.340> talk

now in our next clip we're going to talk

00:02:52.520 --> 00:02:54.940 
now in our next clip we're going to talk
about<00:02:52.700> frostbite<00:02:53.270> what<00:02:53.960> that<00:02:54.140> is<00:02:54.350> and<00:02:54.590> how<00:02:54.890> to

00:02:54.940 --> 00:02:54.950 
about frostbite what that is and how to

00:02:54.950 --> 00:02:57.670 
about frostbite what that is and how to
prevent<00:02:55.340> it<00:02:55.510> to<00:02:56.510> watch<00:02:56.690> the<00:02:56.960> other<00:02:57.080> segments

00:02:57.670 --> 00:02:57.680 
prevent it to watch the other segments
