00:00:00.800 --> 00:00:06.930
 so good afternoon to everyone today i will tell 

00:00:03.540 --> 00:00:10.200
 little eyepiece culinary delights well in 

00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:13.320
 particular about such dishes 

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:15.780
 and the biggest thing about the simplest dish 

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:18.900
 which can be cooked from meat 

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:21.689
 Well, not from any meat but specifically from 

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:22.830
 venison although the rest is the same dish 

00:00:21.689 --> 00:00:26.939
 getting ready and 

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:31.320
 from beef but venison it's certainly yes but 

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:36.750
 in this case in this case I have 

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:39.989
 there is a piece to cram it and deerfish is one 

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:44.780
 of the deer species this is asian 

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:47.190
 a deer here is such a piece but 

00:00:44.780 --> 00:00:48.079
 I am too lazy to cook today and therefore I 

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:51.090
 I decided 

00:00:48.079 --> 00:00:54.239
 I think I'll show Kyle an unusual dish 

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:58.050
 You can say unusual unusual exactly 

00:00:54.239 --> 00:01:00.390
 its singularity consists in simplicity here 

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:03.090
 what can be made from a piece 

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:07.280
 how best to cook a dish of 

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:10.049
 piece of red deer meat 

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:13.680
 nothing is easier how to do simple 

00:01:10.049 --> 00:01:14.549
 Stroganin Planed I previously 

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:18.509
 a little bit of it 

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:20.520
 after the freezer I held him a little 

00:01:18.509 --> 00:01:24.049
 warm to make it easier to cut 

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:26.790
 Well, the meat has become see this kind 

00:01:24.049 --> 00:01:27.479
 such a juicy juicy kind of such 

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:30.270
 reddish 

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:33.810
 well and how we cook but first 

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:35.869
 need to sharpen a knife of course sharpen it 

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:42.170
 very good from me 2 points 

00:01:35.869 --> 00:01:42.170
 because we have to cut us specifically 

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:50.820
 froze and meat because the legs should be at 

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:52.070
 us very spicy well venison is preparing 

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:54.450
 many dishes 

00:01:52.070 --> 00:01:57.210
 the only thing with it is undesirable 

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:59.939
 do let's say grill grill fry 

00:01:57.210 --> 00:02:00.930
 or do shish kebab do it because 

00:01:59.939 --> 00:02:03.899
 then meat again 

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:04.350
 but generally it is of course dietary 

00:02:03.899 --> 00:02:07.710
 product 

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:10.140
 Well, here's planed take here like this 

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:13.290
 way sharp little knife and so here 

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:16.530
 here we cut with such plastic 

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:20.040
 But with such thin steak yah 

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:20.610
 because it is planed meat is this 

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:25.250
 dish 

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:29.700
 invented the peoples of the north and Asia too 

00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:33.000
 That's the way we cut because she 

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:35.940
 easy planing sliced ​​also do 

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:36.540
 peoples of the north and Siberia and the distant 

00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:40.670
 east 

00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:43.290
 still fish but not all fish go here 

00:02:40.670 --> 00:02:46.379
 suitable for such a dish 

00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:49.050
 only fish that are safe 

00:02:46.379 --> 00:02:54.720
 fish have no other infections 

00:02:49.050 --> 00:02:56.550
 there in some parasites well and meat 

00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:59.090
 deer naturally is the purest 

00:02:56.550 --> 00:03:04.080
 diet product in this way 

00:02:59.090 --> 00:03:07.489
 it is cut yes well that's red deer 

00:03:04.080 --> 00:03:07.489
 particular zebra he 

00:03:08.650 --> 00:03:14.439
 introduced in Siberia in Eastern Siberia 

00:03:12.879 --> 00:03:17.819
 so in the far east 

00:03:14.439 --> 00:03:23.260
 Well, and also in China, partly Chinese 

00:03:17.819 --> 00:03:25.480
 also this dish know this 

00:03:23.260 --> 00:03:28.329
 apparently very old dishes well, someone 

00:03:25.480 --> 00:03:31.780
 came up with probably some kind of lazy 

00:03:28.329 --> 00:03:37.629
 like me who doesn't want to cook well 

00:03:31.780 --> 00:03:40.180
 here and so we cut it 

00:03:37.629 --> 00:03:42.549
 the amount that we need you can 

00:03:40.180 --> 00:03:46.060
 grind a little then take 

00:03:42.549 --> 00:03:51.730
 plate well and beautiful so as 

00:03:46.060 --> 00:03:54.549
 we lay out on such a plate 

00:03:51.730 --> 00:04:00.239
 slices so juicy 

00:03:54.549 --> 00:04:00.239
 attractive why i shoot a video about 

00:04:00.269 --> 00:04:07.569
 culinary such gastronomic 

00:04:04.359 --> 00:04:10.629
 so on the gastronomic theme well 

00:04:07.569 --> 00:04:13.599
 because I have a channel about unusual 

00:04:10.629 --> 00:04:19.030
 things but this dish is not quite normal 

00:04:13.599 --> 00:04:22.060
 yes this dish is unusual for on 

00:04:19.030 --> 00:04:24.099
 Central Russia and even on the far 

00:04:22.060 --> 00:04:29.260
 East and Siberia, too, it is not prepared 

00:04:24.099 --> 00:04:31.150
 all firstly so it's not easy 

00:04:29.260 --> 00:04:34.960
 to find here let's say the same 

00:04:31.150 --> 00:04:41.020
 deer yes though mentioned that from beef 

00:04:34.960 --> 00:04:45.550
 also can cook well again can 

00:04:41.020 --> 00:04:49.260
 be someone in some way unpleasant 

00:04:45.550 --> 00:04:52.479
 he has raw meat because it 

00:04:49.260 --> 00:04:54.490
 eaten raw then 

00:04:52.479 --> 00:04:57.250
 just sliced ​​frozen meat 

00:04:54.490 --> 00:05:00.610
 here is such a dish 

00:04:57.250 --> 00:05:03.580
 these here so beautiful mean what 

00:05:00.610 --> 00:05:06.220
 here are the simplest spices 

00:05:03.580 --> 00:05:07.810
 traditional spices here for nations 

00:05:06.220 --> 00:05:14.280
 Siberia and the Far East 

00:05:07.810 --> 00:05:17.770
 this is black little pepper like this we 

00:05:14.280 --> 00:05:24.150
 sprinkle a little pepper 

00:05:17.770 --> 00:05:28.990
 that's salt and salt preferably small 

00:05:24.150 --> 00:05:31.710
 well that's all and the dish is ready here 

00:05:28.990 --> 00:05:39.009
 wish me bon appetit 

00:05:31.710 --> 00:05:41.800
 so here it is taken fork well here 

00:05:39.009 --> 00:05:45.069
 the Chinese here still add instead of salt 

00:05:41.800 --> 00:05:49.620
 your soy pepper soy sauce 

00:05:45.069 --> 00:05:49.620
 without it they can’t 

00:05:51.419 --> 00:05:58.389
 quite tasty some calculations will be 

00:05:55.930 --> 00:06:00.699
 add oil here as I already 

00:05:58.389 --> 00:06:03.099
 mentioned deer meat she's in general then by 

00:06:00.699 --> 00:06:06.610
 again that meat well, since it was 

00:06:03.099 --> 00:06:08.979
 frozen and so and that's when she's growing 

00:06:06.610 --> 00:06:13.449
 it is to become quite juicy and 

00:06:08.979 --> 00:06:18.129
 here you notice a drop of blood there is no 

00:06:13.449 --> 00:06:23.130
 there is this here from a piece of meat from the back 

00:06:18.129 --> 00:06:27.810
 legs and it is not anything of blood 

00:06:23.130 --> 00:06:30.400
 it is either made from fresh meat 

00:06:27.810 --> 00:06:32.500
 either 1 time of ice cream that is 

00:06:30.400 --> 00:06:35.139
 it is undesirable to freeze it to defrost 

00:06:32.500 --> 00:06:37.150
 then freeze again well it's better 

00:06:35.139 --> 00:06:44.169
 heat treatment is carried out with this 

00:06:37.150 --> 00:06:46.180
 such meat Well here is the dish most 

00:06:44.169 --> 00:06:49.779
 simple and the most and maybe the most 

00:06:46.180 --> 00:06:52.539
 an unusual dish like that 

00:06:49.779 --> 00:06:58.840
 will like i will continue about unusual 

00:06:52.539 --> 00:07:02.279
 about some dishes about including 

00:06:58.840 --> 00:07:05.349
 unusual dishes they are common to countries 

00:07:02.279 --> 00:07:11.219
 I'll try it all myself I will jump well 

00:07:05.349 --> 00:07:13.719
