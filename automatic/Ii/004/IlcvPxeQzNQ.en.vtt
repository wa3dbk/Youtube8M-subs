 I said one of butterfield 4 and another of 

00:00:21.450 --> 00:00:24.930
 colau ticos but good I leave it in the background 

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:26.730
 because what I'm going to talk about is good 

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:28.680
 let's talk about today is about 

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:30.480
 first episode of a newbie's diary 

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:32.250
 Okay, you know how good I liked it 

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:34.620
 put that name to the series 

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:37.470
 the fact is that I'm going to give you tips tips 

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:38.970
 how do you want to call about good as not 

00:00:37.470 --> 00:00:41.070
 make so many mistakes 

00:00:38.970 --> 00:00:42.449
 good when you are starting a channel 

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:44.100
 from youtube you know that this series is going to 

00:00:42.449 --> 00:00:45.540
 treat about good to a series of 

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:48.540
 episodes in which I basically 

00:00:45.540 --> 00:00:50.729
 I will give you advice and opinions more or 

00:00:48.540 --> 00:00:52.949
 less about how to avoid making mistakes 

00:00:50.729 --> 00:00:54.870
 common when we are starting our 

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:57.180
 youtube channel so the first one is going to 

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:59.309
 be the how to get the name is worth 

00:00:57.180 --> 00:01:00.960
 the name is something we are going primordial 

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:03.479
 It looks like bullshit but it's pretty 

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:06.690
 important and guys I'm sincere 

00:01:03.479 --> 00:01:08.370
 you have to take a name that is something 

00:01:06.690 --> 00:01:10.440
 symbolic something good you can 

00:01:08.370 --> 00:01:12.720
 recognize your followers obviously me 

00:01:10.440 --> 00:01:15.240
 the truth gave me a name to you hd that 

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:18.060
 it's the weirdest possible thing is not to say 

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:19.950
 and obviously I like my name 

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:21.420
 because obviously I did not wear it 

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:23.670
 but you also have to be something else 

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:25.640
 You know, I'm worthless 

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:27.950
 that name is not really thinking about 

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:30.329
 on YouTube it's worth what it's been 

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:32.009
 oysters how will you find the audience 

00:01:30.329 --> 00:01:34.439
 another attitude and I'm going to make another episode 

00:01:32.009 --> 00:01:36.810
 of these from the novice diary about how 

00:01:34.439 --> 00:01:39.119
 be known but one of the factors 

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:41.670
 it's also the name obviously if 

00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:43.500
 Name guys put something on youtube 

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:44.970
 which describes the content that your visa 

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:47.009
 your channel are going to have a 

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:49.049
 superiority over your competence 

00:01:47.009 --> 00:01:52.170
 brutal is to say imagine you climbed 

00:01:49.049 --> 00:01:54.390
 for better blog if you put the one of 

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:55.890
 youtube name as the best the 

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:57.360
 best blogs in the world or if you go up 

00:01:55.890 --> 00:02:00.179
 gameplays of the cloud and you put of 

00:01:57.360 --> 00:02:02.220
 name with guti gameplay or the best 

00:02:00.179 --> 00:02:04.289
 Call of duty gameplay or things like that 

00:02:02.220 --> 00:02:05.600
 thing is that me that is the name seems 

00:02:04.289 --> 00:02:08.280
 silly but it's super important 

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:10.019
 obviously, guys, I, for example, do not 

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:11.400
 I put in any kind of name like that 

00:02:10.019 --> 00:02:13.500
 special simply put me the name 

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:15.630
 what I liked in this case is 

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:18.120
 things I'm going to explain why selene does not 

00:02:15.630 --> 00:02:19.920
 knows apple laws the push is a 

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:21.090
 mix of buzz lightyear and woody and 

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:22.830
 then the 

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:24.360
 it's basically because there's no bus 

00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:26.310
 I could not here you are watching a rachita 

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:28.290
 of captives the truth I liked a lot 

00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:31.050
 I took out the gein and everything but good 

00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:33.540
 case guys is that I also come to give you 

00:02:31.050 --> 00:02:35.190
 an example such as that of a 

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:37.230
 youtuber which I liked very much 

00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:39.599
 the strategy that used the truth I do not see 

00:02:37.230 --> 00:02:41.670
 its their gameplays the truth is that I do not 

00:02:39.599 --> 00:02:43.860
 like youtuber, it does not call me much 

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:45.870
 but the truth is the strategy course 

00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:48.480
 It was super smart I really liked it 

00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:49.709
 much the strategy he used and the 

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:51.540
 truth is that he is doing very well, that is to say 

00:02:49.709 --> 00:02:54.209
 It has hundreds of thousands of subscribers 

00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:56.640
 so it's a good example and it's the 

00:02:54.209 --> 00:02:58.860
 example of ait even gameplay as you see has 

00:02:56.640 --> 00:03:00.840
 used a YouTube channel that is 

00:02:58.860 --> 00:03:03.360
 a name for your super youtube channel 

00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:05.099
 important and super smart out in a 

00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:06.810
 used the word gameplay in his 

00:03:05.099 --> 00:03:08.160
 name of gameplay then obviously if you 

00:03:06.810 --> 00:03:10.019
 you look at the titles that I put on the 

00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:12.360
 video I always play gameplay 

00:03:10.019 --> 00:03:14.340
 battlefield gameplay of gta or gameplay 

00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:15.840
 of something for copy is what I upload and 

00:03:14.340 --> 00:03:17.819
 if the sub gameplay of something 

00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:19.799
 simply because of its channel name 

00:03:17.819 --> 00:03:22.079
 from youtube the word gameplay already has 

00:03:19.799 --> 00:03:23.670
 superiority have a good advantage 

00:03:22.079 --> 00:03:24.830
 about the rest of the competition is 

00:03:23.670 --> 00:03:27.320
 tell 

00:03:24.830 --> 00:03:29.090
 it's just a kind of strategy that 

00:03:27.320 --> 00:03:31.930
 I can provide you with the time to collect 

00:03:29.090 --> 00:03:34.100
 or I do not know how to say it I do not know how 

00:03:31.930 --> 00:03:35.990
 explain it describe it simply to the 

00:03:34.100 --> 00:03:37.970
 time to connect with more people more 

00:03:35.990 --> 00:03:40.190
 audience then this mini super good 

00:03:37.970 --> 00:03:42.560
 the case is that another example if you go up 

00:03:40.190 --> 00:03:44.960
 blogs then you have to have something of 

00:03:42.560 --> 00:03:47.090
 blogs in the name or if you go up I know 

00:03:44.960 --> 00:03:48.980
 How to make cakes, then? 

00:03:47.090 --> 00:03:51.770
 channel so you could do better how to do 

00:03:48.980 --> 00:03:53.720
 the best cakes or how to make 

00:03:51.770 --> 00:03:56.810
 pies know well I know things but 

00:03:53.720 --> 00:03:58.670
 guys the truth is fine that you use 

00:03:56.810 --> 00:04:00.170
 that strategy the truth I would have 

00:03:58.670 --> 00:04:01.630
 used what happens is that I did not have 

00:04:00.170 --> 00:04:03.680
 so much experience on this from youtube 

00:04:01.630 --> 00:04:06.380
 but the name also has to be 

00:04:03.680 --> 00:04:08.510
 something I do not know something that describes you to 

00:04:06.380 --> 00:04:10.400
 you something symbol that someone who 

00:04:08.510 --> 00:04:12.530
 your audience when they go to 

00:04:10.400 --> 00:04:13.670
 name then that you name for something is 

00:04:12.530 --> 00:04:14.600
 say for example I'll give you a 

00:04:13.670 --> 00:04:17.560
 example 

00:04:14.600 --> 00:04:19.790
 gÃ¼idi rex the name of wikileaks is a 

00:04:17.560 --> 00:04:21.650
 name that describes you perfectly is 

00:04:19.790 --> 00:04:24.110
 a pretty cool name is a symbol 

00:04:21.650 --> 00:04:25.850
 what symbolizes him and him specifically 

00:04:24.110 --> 00:04:27.380
 and obviously if someone says by the 

00:04:25.850 --> 00:04:29.270
 street willy rex as everyone knows 

00:04:27.380 --> 00:04:31.220
 who is talking about but obviously 

00:04:29.270 --> 00:04:31.700
 with rex does not use any type of 

00:04:31.220 --> 00:04:34.490
 strategy 

00:04:31.700 --> 00:04:35.960
 so gameplay best gameplays of things 

00:04:34.490 --> 00:04:38.660
 so environment did not need 

00:04:35.960 --> 00:04:40.310
 because he was one of the first ones he did not 

00:04:38.660 --> 00:04:42.530
 missing but today the competition is 

00:04:40.310 --> 00:04:45.320
 so brutal so big that the more 

00:04:42.530 --> 00:04:46.580
 bonus the more advantage you put to yourself 

00:04:45.320 --> 00:04:48.680
 same then easier that is going to suppose 

00:04:46.580 --> 00:04:50.900
 grow up not but good the case guys is 

00:04:48.680 --> 00:04:54.500
 I wanted to talk to you about this is good 

00:04:50.900 --> 00:04:56.600
 small tip a small strategy small 

00:04:54.500 --> 00:04:58.310
 I do not know how I will follow the schedules of 

00:04:56.600 --> 00:04:59.960
 this series the truth the best suv o 

00:04:58.310 --> 00:05:01.400
 when you really want to odesur 

00:04:59.960 --> 00:05:03.080
 when I feel like some days 

00:05:01.400 --> 00:05:04.970
 I will bring gameplays commented on some 

00:05:03.080 --> 00:05:06.650
 kind of theme of the good ones that you 

00:05:04.970 --> 00:05:08.540
 have to talk and others game well 

00:05:06.650 --> 00:05:10.490
 other days I will bring you also gameplays 

00:05:08.540 --> 00:05:12.980
 of this kind not helping you to 

00:05:10.490 --> 00:05:14.420
 those that are beginning to grow and you 

00:05:12.980 --> 00:05:15.800
 I say this episode has been about the 

00:05:14.420 --> 00:05:17.180
 name if you have any kind of doubt 

00:05:15.800 --> 00:05:19.940
 you can leave it in the comments already 

00:05:17.180 --> 00:05:21.860
 I say summary try to get in the 

00:05:19.940 --> 00:05:23.630
 name of our YouTube channel something 

00:05:21.860 --> 00:05:25.700
 that describes you so much yourselves 

00:05:23.630 --> 00:05:28.400
 as the content that you are bringing to 

00:05:25.700 --> 00:05:30.110
 I already tell you, imagine that you are a 

00:05:28.400 --> 00:05:32.210
 man me that I know what it is or why 

00:05:30.110 --> 00:05:33.740
 example my name of this case something that 

00:05:32.210 --> 00:05:35.570
 symbolizes me because I love is toy 

00:05:33.740 --> 00:05:37.280
 story would have put me to the best 

00:05:35.570 --> 00:05:39.740
 look for employment 

00:05:37.280 --> 00:05:42.080
 there is the gameplay for example as the 

00:05:39.740 --> 00:05:44.270
 name of my website is not something that 

00:05:42.080 --> 00:05:46.160
 that I already tell you to symbolize but that 

00:05:44.270 --> 00:05:48.530
 also describes at the same time the 

00:05:46.160 --> 00:05:50.480
 content that you are uploading to the channel and 

00:05:48.530 --> 00:05:53.480
 so you will have advantages over yours 

00:05:50.480 --> 00:05:55.639
 competition is worth please I'll try 

00:05:53.480 --> 00:05:57.770
 abstain to put the strange names 

00:05:55.639 --> 00:06:00.320
 like for example the name that I put myself 

00:05:57.770 --> 00:06:02.810
 I obviously spouses put names 

00:06:00.320 --> 00:06:05.300
 Strangers is fine as long as 

00:06:02.810 --> 00:06:06.950
 they are symbolizing something but insured 

00:06:05.300 --> 00:06:09.380
 that you also have something that I know 

00:06:06.950 --> 00:06:10.730
 placed a pen with which to compensate not me 

00:06:09.380 --> 00:06:12.830
 I get married for example put me a name 

00:06:10.730 --> 00:06:15.410
 super weird and at the same time I did not put 

00:06:12.830 --> 00:06:17.780
 nothing to compensate for what then in 

00:06:15.410 --> 00:06:19.310
 certain way I'm disadvantaged not the 

00:06:17.780 --> 00:06:21.980
 most people do not put any 

00:06:19.310 --> 00:06:23.450
 kind of names about monkeys about 

00:06:21.980 --> 00:06:25.610
 content of which they are uploading to their 

00:06:23.450 --> 00:06:28.100
 channel so to the minimum that you 

00:06:25.610 --> 00:06:29.510
 put some kind of description in 

00:06:28.100 --> 00:06:31.340
 your name our YouTube channel 

00:06:29.510 --> 00:06:33.320
 you are going to have an advantage over 

00:06:31.340 --> 00:06:34.910
 human and passional nonsense but it's 

00:06:33.320 --> 00:06:36.440
 it's really worth guys so nothing 

00:06:34.910 --> 00:06:38.240
 I just wanted but he wanted 

00:06:36.440 --> 00:06:41.930
 show you this little rachita in the background too 

00:06:38.240 --> 00:06:43.880
 he wanted us good and I tell you to help in 

00:06:41.930 --> 00:06:46.190

 is your name that is the first 1000 

00:06:46.190 --> 00:06:49.640
 Now I'm going to do a lot more things 

00:06:47.750 --> 00:06:50.870
 I have quite a few things already thought 

00:06:49.640 --> 00:06:53.120
 I say I do not know how the 

00:06:50.870 --> 00:06:54.890
 schedule and guys have you also

 make more episodes of this with killzone 

00:06:56.540 --> 00:07:00.440
 of background but good the case yes is that if 

00:06:58.970 --> 00:07:01.760
 you liked it if you found it useful 

00:07:00.440 --> 00:07:03.830
