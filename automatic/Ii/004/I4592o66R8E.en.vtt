 People are here with Ben Factor. 

00:00:08.519 --> 00:00:14.990

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:23.910
 similarities with danny is and 

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:25.920
 because I wanted 6% because it's six 

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:28.439
 people when playing two online 

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:31.109
 friends can see you sitting here 

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:32.790
 on the hood of the car is one of the most 

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:34.800
 better flashy I do not think I need 

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:37.469
 nor to speak is the fact that he has two 

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:39.329
 wheels here for the double attraction in each 

00:00:37.469 --> 00:00:41.010
 one of the wheels has individual traction 

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:43.500
 You can see when to get the car. 

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:44.910
 here I will do it is to make a sung 

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:46.739
 of opinion is that only you see right 

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:47.820
 how does the attraction work 

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:49.559
 of those two wheels 

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:51.329
 I am no expert on cars not 

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:53.850
 I know if that physically changes some 

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:55.620
 thing but what I realized in gameplay is 

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:57.870
 that to make ascents this car is a 

00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:59.789
 monster personal yes he does uploads 

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:01.949
 he should be in town very fast in 

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:03.750
 up is a very powerful car as well 

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:06.180
 difficult to stop and we will make a 

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:08.400
 both of which is also very varied has 

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:11.670
 pretty thing to do with 

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:13.619

 he does not sell anything to other excellencies 

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:22.200
 It's a really good car, and come on, let's go. 

00:01:20.759 --> 00:01:23.369

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:24.960
 tank after we make a 

00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:27.630
 The chase was quick here just to 

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:29.460
 see the performance of the vehicle but is 

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:31.079
 really cool car, very cool car 

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:33.180
 of everything that is accustomed and I think 

00:01:31.079 --> 00:01:35.310
 This makes him the most 

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:37.350

 details on ancine and if it 's home and there 

00:01:51.509 --> 00:01:55.740
 forgot how this comedy finally 

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:57.360
 if chrome and old disagreed then 

00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:59.700

00:02:02.399 --> 00:02:05.460
 chrome grille then all the details 

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:07.290
 chrome 

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:09.330
 We can put this wheel here in the 

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:11.280
 front I can not only one thing not 

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:12.690
 I like that safe road it ruins all 

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:13.680
 the floor of the personal car so I'll leave 

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:16.409
 the car 

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:18.150
 original even taag already put the horn 

00:02:16.409 --> 00:02:20.700

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:22.739
 of xenon a yellow plate on black 

00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:24.180
 Let's paint it two colors for 

00:02:22.739 --> 00:02:26.849

00:02:26.849 --> 00:02:32.400
 try to beat everything put in the details 

00:02:30.719 --> 00:02:34.909
 and I do not know if necessary put chrome 

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:34.909
 in time 

00:02:50.709 --> 00:02:55.159
 I think it fits well with chrome 

00:02:53.480 --> 00:02:57.379
 still quite accustomed black 

00:02:55.159 --> 00:02:59.450

00:03:20.329 --> 00:03:24.379
 chroma give to keep the style I do not 

00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:25.010

00:03:24.379 --> 00:03:26.659

00:04:10.720 --> 00:04:15.290
 Today we're going to give him a tire slash. 

00:04:13.010 --> 00:04:18.680
 to give that yellow last week of 

00:04:15.290 --> 00:04:20.419
 O the woman who burst let's start 

00:04:18.680 --> 00:04:21.979
 look for it by reminding young people 

00:04:20.419 --> 00:04:23.960
 you liked also not forgotten 

00:04:21.979 --> 00:04:25.610
 comment leaving a note from 0 to 10 

00:04:23.960 --> 00:04:27.680
 for the tanquinho and if you like 

00:04:25.610 --> 00:04:30.289
 persecution also left a note of 0 

00:04:27.680 --> 00:04:32.090
 to 10 for the pursuit personal beauty 

00:04:30.289 --> 00:04:34.050
 Let's start to cause damage to 

00:04:32.090 --> 00:04:36.330
 get public abuses of the world 

00:04:34.050 --> 00:04:38.370
 the island in order to indicate someone's type 

00:04:36.330 --> 00:04:41.190
 lunch meeting takes place will it be 

00:04:38.370 --> 00:04:44.699
 take it from me that I 'm going to blow it up 23 and 

00:04:41.190 --> 00:04:46.800
 was the staff that the police coming mouth 

00:04:44.699 --> 00:04:49.289
 in personal networks and we start 

00:04:46.800 --> 00:04:51.360
 persecution to put health load I go 

00:04:49.289 --> 00:04:52.889
 trying to make a way to this day does not 

00:04:51.360 --> 00:04:55.620
 too much sense to try and keep this 

00:04:52.889 --> 00:04:57.449
 even in the city because the car 

00:04:55.620 --> 00:04:58.919
 it is very fast and very powerful which gives a 

00:04:57.449 --> 00:05:00.060
 problem when I'm going to hit for example 

00:04:58.919 --> 00:05:02.370
 head on with him 

00:05:00.060 --> 00:05:04.110
 franklin is easily flung to 

00:05:02.370 --> 00:05:07.050
 out of the car then switched're quite 

00:05:04.110 --> 00:05:08.669
 careful with this it happens with ways it 

00:05:07.050 --> 00:05:11.509
 all chromed does not enjoy the details in 

00:05:08.669 --> 00:05:14.940
 chrome and the gilded car 

00:05:11.509 --> 00:05:18.479
 Man, you saw what I just did . 

00:05:14.940 --> 00:05:21.360
 make a summit with I'm already dead I'm already 

00:05:18.479 --> 00:05:22.830
 Happy I run over the police car and get 

00:05:21.360 --> 00:05:24.150
 blew up the police car with the 

00:05:22.830 --> 00:05:27.599
 trampling 

00:05:24.150 --> 00:05:29.669
 Fuck, that 's good, I already did one. 

00:05:27.599 --> 00:05:32.069
 chase with him is test staff 

00:05:29.669 --> 00:05:33.599
 and in fact was not test was not 

00:05:32.069 --> 00:05:36.569
 recording but I at the time I went 

00:05:33.599 --> 00:05:42.979
 start chasing the police 

00:05:36.569 --> 00:05:48.690
 oh no, I never tire of it 

00:05:42.979 --> 00:05:50.130
 I do not know that it's going to look like a bad bag. 

00:05:48.690 --> 00:05:52.199
 on the first beat I made. 

00:05:50.130 --> 00:05:53.639
 front or back in the other video 

00:05:52.199 --> 00:05:55.949
 I was recording I died 

00:05:53.639 --> 00:05:57.900
 franklin was hurled a little to the 

00:05:55.949 --> 00:06:00.889
 I said fucking it's good to be careful with the 

00:05:57.900 --> 00:06:00.889
 car but not the way 

00:06:04.250 --> 00:06:09.120
 not only do we have an exploded helicopter 

00:06:06.900 --> 00:06:10.469
 like the helicopter that blew up the cases 

00:06:09.120 --> 00:06:13.379
 I happened to know what kind of a 

00:06:10.469 --> 00:06:15.060
 Helicopter, it's just to start well. 

00:06:13.379 --> 00:06:16.259
 persecution and that it is not 

00:06:15.060 --> 00:06:18.509
 very epic snow 

00:06:16.259 --> 00:06:20.610
 I do not need anything else, just look at the 

00:06:18.509 --> 00:06:22.469
 car colors like so pretty né 

00:06:20.610 --> 00:06:24.659
 and besides what I've already studied the game 

00:06:22.469 --> 00:06:27.690
 asking for copy of atrocity at home or he 

00:06:24.659 --> 00:06:30.060
 built his house on the cable right now 

00:06:27.690 --> 00:06:32.789
 and I 'm on fire 

00:06:30.060 --> 00:06:34.409
 learn this fucking damn I'm dumb 

00:06:32.789 --> 00:06:36.629
 then the moment I got involved 

00:06:34.409 --> 00:06:39.000
 develop the tube on this process 

00:06:36.629 --> 00:06:41.440
 all on fire stick 

00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:45.700
 Pedro had already passed over the 

00:06:41.440 --> 00:06:47.350
 Fire exploded right al cum was 

00:06:45.700 --> 00:06:48.370
 very fast perception already the second 

00:06:47.350 --> 00:06:50.260
 I have but I think we'll do everything 

00:06:48.370 --> 00:06:52.840
 to explode and copy or with pump 

00:06:50.260 --> 00:06:54.760
 Silver ziba by car tail 

00:06:52.840 --> 00:06:55.690
 Police was cool. It was cool . 

00:06:54.760 --> 00:06:57.340
