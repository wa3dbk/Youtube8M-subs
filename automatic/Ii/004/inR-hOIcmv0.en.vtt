00:01:24.670 --> 00:01:24.680 
around the wand and you have to remember

00:01:24.680 --> 00:01:26.650 
around the wand and you have to remember
that<00:01:24.830> the<00:01:25.010> wand<00:01:25.220> is<00:01:25.370> very<00:01:25.700> hot<00:01:26.150> and<00:01:26.330> I<00:01:26.420> have

00:01:26.650 --> 00:01:26.660 
that the wand is very hot and I have

00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:28.390 
that the wand is very hot and I have
burned<00:01:26.930> myself<00:01:27.110> a<00:01:27.350> couple<00:01:27.530> of<00:01:27.620> times<00:01:27.800> this

00:01:28.390 --> 00:01:28.400 
burned myself a couple of times this

this does come with a glove if you're

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:34.300 
this does come with a glove if you're
really<00:01:32.270> really<00:01:33.050> worried<00:01:33.710> about<00:01:33.800> burning

00:01:34.300 --> 00:01:34.310 
really really worried about burning

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:35.980 
really really worried about burning
yourself<00:01:34.430> I'm<00:01:34.850> kind<00:01:35.120> of<00:01:35.210> a<00:01:35.330> bit<00:01:35.480> used<00:01:35.660> to<00:01:35.870> it

00:01:35.980 --> 00:01:35.990 
yourself I'm kind of a bit used to it

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:41.200 
yourself I'm kind of a bit used to it
now<00:01:36.020> so<00:01:37.150> just<00:01:38.150> hold<00:01:38.330> on<00:01:38.630> to<00:01:38.870> this<00:01:39.020> for<00:01:39.730> about<00:01:40.730> 20

00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:41.210 
now so just hold on to this for about 20

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:44.080 
now so just hold on to this for about 20
seconds<00:01:41.690> or<00:01:42.310> just<00:01:43.310> when<00:01:43.430> you<00:01:43.490> feel<00:01:43.520> like<00:01:43.820> it

00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:44.090 
seconds or just when you feel like it

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:48.310 
seconds or just when you feel like it
it's<00:01:44.750> it's<00:01:45.200> baked<00:01:45.620> I'm<00:01:46.630> but<00:01:47.630> Ozzie<00:01:47.990> the<00:01:48.200> hair

00:01:48.310 --> 00:01:48.320 
it's it's baked I'm but Ozzie the hair

00:01:48.320 --> 00:01:50.530 
it's it's baked I'm but Ozzie the hair
is<00:01:48.410> quite<00:01:48.500> good<00:01:48.710> you<00:01:48.890> don't<00:01:49.100> have<00:01:49.310> to<00:01:49.520> hold<00:01:50.300> it

00:01:50.530 --> 00:01:50.540 
is quite good you don't have to hold it

00:01:50.540 --> 00:01:53.380 
is quite good you don't have to hold it
on<00:01:50.660> for<00:01:51.020> that<00:01:51.140> long<00:01:51.550> so<00:01:52.550> just<00:01:52.790> sort<00:01:52.970> of<00:01:53.000> holds

00:01:53.380 --> 00:01:53.390 
on for that long so just sort of holds

00:01:53.390 --> 00:01:57.840 
on for that long so just sort of holds
back<00:01:53.600> there<00:01:53.840> for<00:01:54.050> a<00:01:54.110> bit<00:01:54.320> once<00:01:54.530> it<00:01:54.680> cools<00:01:54.860> down

00:01:57.840 --> 00:01:57.850 

00:01:57.850 --> 00:02:02.940 

so<00:01:58.850> that's<00:01:59.030> the<00:01:59.210> first<00:01:59.420> curl<00:02:00.430> you<00:02:01.430> can<00:02:01.640> see

00:02:02.940 --> 00:02:02.950 
so that's the first curl you can see

00:02:02.950 --> 00:02:06.340 
so that's the first curl you can see
that's<00:02:03.950> the<00:02:04.040> first<00:02:04.280> car<00:02:04.550> and<00:02:04.820> I<00:02:05.570> go<00:02:06.020> on<00:02:06.140> to<00:02:06.260> the

00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:06.350 
that's the first car and I go on to the

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:10.600 
that's the first car and I go on to the
next<00:02:06.560> one<00:02:08.800> excuse<00:02:09.800> the<00:02:09.830> state<00:02:10.099> of<00:02:10.129> the<00:02:10.399> hair

00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:10.610 
next one excuse the state of the hair

00:02:10.610 --> 00:02:12.789 
next one excuse the state of the hair
because<00:02:11.000> I<00:02:11.120> i<00:02:11.330> was<00:02:11.569> i<00:02:11.780> was<00:02:12.079> thinking<00:02:12.560> about

00:02:12.789 --> 00:02:12.799 
because I i was i was thinking about

00:02:12.799 --> 00:02:14.619 
because I i was i was thinking about
rewetting<00:02:13.549> it<00:02:13.819> and<00:02:13.939> then<00:02:14.030> I<00:02:14.060> thought<00:02:14.239> oh<00:02:14.390> no

00:02:14.619 --> 00:02:14.629 
rewetting it and then I thought oh no

00:02:14.629 --> 00:02:16.860 
rewetting it and then I thought oh no
let<00:02:15.230> me<00:02:15.319> do<00:02:15.469> a<00:02:15.499> tutorial<00:02:16.010> on<00:02:16.400> this

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:16.870 
let me do a tutorial on this

00:02:16.870 --> 00:02:20.820 
let me do a tutorial on this
so<00:02:17.379> it's<00:02:17.560> a<00:02:17.709> little<00:02:17.860> bit<00:02:18.209> fluffy<00:02:19.620> but<00:02:20.620> it's

00:02:20.820 --> 00:02:20.830 
so it's a little bit fluffy but it's

00:02:20.830 --> 00:02:26.729 
so it's a little bit fluffy but it's
still<00:02:21.250> very<00:02:21.670> soft<00:02:24.390> it<00:02:25.390> is<00:02:25.659> tricky<00:02:26.019> to<00:02:26.440> start

00:02:26.729 --> 00:02:26.739 
still very soft it is tricky to start

00:02:26.739 --> 00:02:28.860 
still very soft it is tricky to start
with<00:02:27.010> when<00:02:27.250> you're<00:02:27.400> doing<00:02:27.730> these<00:02:27.970> curls<00:02:28.480> with

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:28.870
