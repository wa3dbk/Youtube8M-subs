00:00:17.570 --> 00:00:17.580 
when transitioning I'm not one of those

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:22.110 
when transitioning I'm not one of those
really<00:00:18.580> die<00:00:19.300> hard<00:00:19.720> I<00:00:20.199> guess<00:00:20.279> natural<00:00:21.279> I'm<00:00:21.880> just

00:00:22.110 --> 00:00:22.120 
really die hard I guess natural I'm just

00:00:22.120 --> 00:00:24.270 
really die hard I guess natural I'm just
letting<00:00:22.360> you<00:00:22.390> know<00:00:22.450> what<00:00:22.750> I<00:00:22.780> did<00:00:23.110> hopefully<00:00:24.100> it

00:00:24.270 --> 00:00:24.280 
letting you know what I did hopefully it

00:00:24.280 --> 00:00:27.600 
letting you know what I did hopefully it
helps<00:00:24.790> and<00:00:25.120> if<00:00:25.630> you<00:00:25.840> have<00:00:26.140> the<00:00:26.860> discipline<00:00:27.550> to

00:00:27.600 --> 00:00:27.610 
helps and if you have the discipline to

00:00:27.610 --> 00:00:32.279 
helps and if you have the discipline to
go<00:00:27.910> further<00:00:28.210> like<00:00:28.720> a<00:00:28.750> lot<00:00:29.020> of<00:00:31.110> supernaturals<00:00:32.110> I

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:32.289 
go further like a lot of supernaturals I

00:00:32.289 --> 00:00:34.319 
go further like a lot of supernaturals I
guess<00:00:32.469> thought<00:00:32.649> you<00:00:32.800> would<00:00:32.950> call<00:00:33.129> go<00:00:34.059> ahead

00:00:34.319 --> 00:00:34.329 
guess thought you would call go ahead

00:00:34.329 --> 00:00:37.590 
guess thought you would call go ahead
and<00:00:34.510> do<00:00:34.660> it<00:00:34.870> if<00:00:35.079> you<00:00:35.440> can<00:00:35.950> do<00:00:36.100> it<00:00:36.420> further<00:00:37.420> than

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:37.600 
and do it if you can do it further than

00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:40.790 
and do it if you can do it further than
what<00:00:37.929> I've<00:00:38.079> done<00:00:38.320> when<00:00:39.129> I<00:00:39.159> transition<00:00:40.149> I
