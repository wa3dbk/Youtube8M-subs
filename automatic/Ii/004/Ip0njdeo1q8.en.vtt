00:00:58.099 --> 00:00:58.109 
have had it I'm not sure exactly where

00:00:58.109 --> 00:00:59.720 
have had it I'm not sure exactly where
that<00:00:58.289> went<00:00:58.469> from<00:00:58.680> but<00:00:58.920> he<00:00:58.980> was<00:00:59.129> suspended<00:00:59.609> to

failing<00:01:00.329> a<00:01:00.390> drug<00:01:00.629> test<00:01:01.100> so<00:01:02.100> what<00:01:02.340> does<00:01:02.430> that

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:02.460 
failing a drug test so what does that

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:05.630 
failing a drug test so what does that
mean<00:01:02.820> the<00:01:03.059> WWE<00:01:03.710> went<00:01:04.710> a<00:01:04.830> week<00:01:05.010> without<00:01:05.189> sin

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:05.640 
mean the WWE went a week without sin

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:07.100 
mean the WWE went a week without sin
cara<00:01:05.880> and<00:01:06.180> they<00:01:06.270> were<00:01:06.390> like<00:01:06.540> now<00:01:06.869> that's
