and<00:01:11.400> the<00:01:11.640> crazy<00:01:11.850> thing<00:01:11.939> is<00:01:12.150> that<00:01:12.479> I<00:01:12.510> actually

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:12.780 
and the crazy thing is that I actually

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:15.890 
and the crazy thing is that I actually
tried<00:01:13.290> another<00:01:13.619> one<00:01:13.860> first<00:01:14.509> it<00:01:15.509> was<00:01:15.659> like<00:01:15.780> the

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:15.900 
tried another one first it was like the

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:19.010 
tried another one first it was like the
silver<00:01:16.140> one<00:01:16.350> with<00:01:16.560> a<00:01:16.590> bunch<00:01:16.920> of<00:01:18.020> rhinestones

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:19.020 
silver one with a bunch of rhinestones

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:21.230 
silver one with a bunch of rhinestones
like<00:01:19.680> different<00:01:19.979> color<00:01:20.130> Bryce<00:01:20.400> rhinestones

00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:21.240 
like different color Bryce rhinestones

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:23.149 
like different color Bryce rhinestones
and<00:01:21.509> I<00:01:21.930> decided<00:01:22.229> that<00:01:22.439> instead<00:01:22.560> of<00:01:22.740> trying<00:01:23.040> it

00:01:23.149 --> 00:01:23.159 
and I decided that instead of trying it

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:24.649 
and I decided that instead of trying it
on<00:01:23.220> my<00:01:23.369> nails<00:01:23.580> I<00:01:23.790> would<00:01:23.909> try<00:01:24.090> it<00:01:24.150> on<00:01:24.270> my<00:01:24.420> toes

00:01:24.649 --> 00:01:24.659 
on my nails I would try it on my toes

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:26.240 
on my nails I would try it on my toes
first<00:01:24.930> and<00:01:25.259> see<00:01:25.409> how<00:01:25.439> long<00:01:25.650> that<00:01:25.890> would<00:01:26.189> last

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:26.250 
first and see how long that would last

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:28.940 
first and see how long that would last
so<00:01:26.759> I<00:01:26.939> tried<00:01:27.360> them<00:01:27.659> and<00:01:27.689> they<00:01:27.960> lasted<00:01:28.409> for<00:01:28.619> two

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:28.950 
so I tried them and they lasted for two

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:30.530 
so I tried them and they lasted for two
weeks<00:01:29.250> so<00:01:29.430> I<00:01:29.490> was<00:01:29.610> really<00:01:29.820> impressed<00:01:29.970> I'm<00:01:30.360> like
