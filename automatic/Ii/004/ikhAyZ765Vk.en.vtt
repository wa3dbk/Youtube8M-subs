 blocking he had my computer 

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:14.959
 you block the access it closes 

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:16.730
 immediately when the person tries to 

00:02:14.959 --> 00:02:18.920
 access is what we will be seeing 

00:02:16.730 --> 00:02:21.799
 now for example I'll be blocking 

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:24.769
 that facebook here have this option of the 

00:02:21.799 --> 00:02:25.819
 the network both on the network and the 

00:02:24.769 --> 00:02:28.730
 user right 

00:02:25.819 --> 00:02:31.400
 each local user is placing 

00:02:28.730 --> 00:02:33.920
 you can leave a comment 

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:37.220
 set the initial lock time and 

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:40.459
 The end is also giving you the days that you 

00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:44.120
 want to block the right grandson that 

00:02:40.459 --> 00:02:47.660
 Okay, and the facebook site, it's okay. 

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:50.030
 really blocked 

00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:52.700
 here you can edit this information 

00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:55.010
 You just put it here yourself. 

00:02:52.700 --> 00:02:56.690
 can put another rule right 

00:02:55.010 --> 00:02:58.660
 for example we will be blocking here 

00:02:56.690 --> 00:03:01.940
 now youtube 

00:02:58.660 --> 00:03:03.920
 Fernando and give an ok then these two 

00:03:01.940 --> 00:03:07.220
 sites here are blocked 

00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:11.019
 You're going to turn it on right now, we'll go. 

00:03:07.220 --> 00:03:14.299
 You're checking to see if it works, right? 

00:03:11.019 --> 00:03:18.220
 that google environment is usually 

00:03:14.299 --> 00:03:18.220
 Let's go here on facebook on youtube 

00:03:18.970 --> 00:03:23.540
 and he closed immediately as 

00:03:22.160 --> 00:03:26.560
 did you see it? 

00:03:23.540 --> 00:03:30.829
 Let's try to get on facebook now. 

00:03:26.560 --> 00:03:34.760
 to see it closes immediately any 

00:03:30.829 --> 00:03:38.950
 site you can access except youtube or 

00:03:34.760 --> 00:03:42.400
 the facebook it closes as it looks 

00:03:38.950 --> 00:03:42.400
 another interesting option 

00:03:42.960 --> 00:03:51.600
 of the program is permissions right 

00:03:46.470 --> 00:03:53.370
 is removing permissions here 

00:03:51.600 --> 00:03:57.150
 permissions it gives you the option of you 

00:03:53.370 --> 00:03:59.460
 blocks all sites - the ones released 

00:03:57.150 --> 00:04:02.820
 in the list you can only register here 

00:03:59.460 --> 00:04:07.020
 it is the same as operating is the 

00:04:02.820 --> 00:04:08.820
 website you want to release but it goes 

00:04:07.020 --> 00:04:12.540
 block all other sites 

00:04:08.820 --> 00:04:15.840
 site for example I'll put the site 

00:04:12.540 --> 00:04:18.600
 default is not my browser from this browser 

00:04:15.840 --> 00:04:22.860
 in question put here my user 

00:04:18.600 --> 00:04:27.510
 I need to define an okay, right? 

00:04:22.860 --> 00:04:29.780
 and here gives an activator here so let's go 

00:04:27.510 --> 00:04:29.780
 over there 

00:04:29.960 --> 00:04:36.350
 who released the google website normally 

00:04:33.919 --> 00:04:39.080
 right to access 

00:04:36.350 --> 00:04:41.990
 Can I do all the right research on the 

00:04:39.080 --> 00:04:43.160
 however other sites here for example the 

00:04:41.990 --> 00:04:45.880
 Facebook 

00:04:43.160 --> 00:04:45.880
 he closes 

00:04:47.420 --> 00:04:50.830
 Youtube, for example. 

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:02.210
 check here 

00:05:02.540 --> 00:05:11.200
 No, people, sorry, I did not put it. 

00:05:05.060 --> 00:05:13.910
 here here Bluck option to activate now O 

00:05:11.200 --> 00:05:17.270
 Facebook 

00:05:13.910 --> 00:05:21.200
 he will then observe this option 

00:05:17.270 --> 00:05:23.540
 here is what poses understood is right gugu 

00:05:21.200 --> 00:05:27.890
 no other site 

00:05:23.540 --> 00:05:32.990
 it immediately closes another option that 

00:05:27.890 --> 00:05:35.300
 the program has the third option is access 

00:05:32.990 --> 00:05:37.910
 blocked is giving you a report that was 

00:05:35.300 --> 00:05:40.460
 blocked right you block 

00:05:37.910 --> 00:05:41.960
 Obviously the site is for you. 

00:05:40.460 --> 00:05:46.220
 control right? 

00:05:41.960 --> 00:05:48.560
 and here you can remove importing you 

00:05:46.220 --> 00:05:52.310
 you can view as a login 

00:05:48.560 --> 00:05:54.260
 you can also print and here is the 

00:05:52.310 --> 00:05:56.330
 access monitor is not that it gives you a 

00:05:54.260 --> 00:06:01.040
 access report right 

00:05:56.330 --> 00:06:02.930
 the time of user right and gives you the date 

00:06:01.040 --> 00:06:08.990
 exactly the time is you can 

00:06:02.930 --> 00:06:14.150
 print every time the garnett of 

00:06:08.990 --> 00:06:17.180
 the day of the report that you're 

00:06:14.150 --> 00:06:19.610
 so this is it folks 

00:06:17.180 --> 00:06:24.490
