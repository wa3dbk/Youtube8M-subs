as you can see I probably won't be able
to<00:03:47.170> see<00:03:47.410> much<00:03:47.650> on<00:03:47.920> this<00:03:48.100> side<00:03:48.450> go<00:03:49.450> to<00:03:49.480> the<00:03:49.600> other

00:03:49.710 --> 00:03:49.720

to see much on this side go to the other
side<00:03:51.329> as<00:03:52.329> I<00:03:52.540> was<00:03:52.660> saying<00:03:52.959> that

00:03:55.140 --> 00:03:55.150 
side as I was saying that

00:03:55.150 --> 00:04:00.270 
side as I was saying that
I<00:03:55.440> had<00:03:56.440> to<00:03:56.590> put<00:03:56.830> a<00:03:56.860> lot<00:03:57.340> of<00:03:57.700> coat<00:03:58.230> to<00:03:59.230> get<00:04:00.099> this
