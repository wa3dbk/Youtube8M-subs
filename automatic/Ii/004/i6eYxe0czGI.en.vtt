00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.220
What are you doing over there?

00:00:02.240 --> 00:00:04.240
Sujan's father's plan seems to be revealed...

00:00:04.240 --> 00:00:08.700
It seems like some kind of extraordinary things are waiting for us..

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:15.900
Welcome to...Sujan's Home...!

00:00:16.040 --> 00:00:22.820
Sujan's father's "surprise welcome home party" began!

00:00:22.820 --> 00:00:26.080
They are Nepali traditional musicians, 'Zeyuppu Bajung'!

00:00:26.080 --> 00:00:30.280
Welcome, Sujan! Welcome home, Mr.Sujan!

00:00:30.280 --> 00:00:38.020
(But it seems like they all look so serious...)

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:41.880
Welcome home! Sujan's friends!

00:00:41.880 --> 00:00:44.980
(Sujan road seems to have a peculiar tension...)

00:00:44.980 --> 00:00:47.000
It looks like a festival...

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:50.300
(Nepal has a culture to do welcome-home party starting from the entrance of the village!)

00:00:50.300 --> 00:00:54.520
(Actually, we call traditional musicians only when we welcome king..)

00:00:54.520 --> 00:00:57.160
(Sujan didn't even expect this much big welcome home party..)

00:00:57.160 --> 00:00:59.820
Look at this! All of the people in this village are here!

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:03.600
(The first time to have these many people to welcome 'Where's My Friend's Home'!)

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:04.920
Wow...Ma..many..!

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:06.520
And my younger sisters!

00:01:06.520 --> 00:01:12.160
Sujan's younger sisters!

00:01:12.160 --> 00:01:15.460
(And their face suddenly became bright.)

00:01:15.460 --> 00:01:18.440
(All of Sujan's younger sisters are smiling brightly at them.)

00:01:18.460 --> 00:01:23.620
(I don't know, but I feel like clapping...)

00:01:23.620 --> 00:01:26.460
No, I can't go anymore.

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:29.680
(Sujan is too shy now to stand in front of his family...)

00:01:29.680 --> 00:01:35.020
(It's been 2 years for Sujan to meet his families!)

00:01:35.020 --> 00:01:38.900
(Sujan's cute youngest sister and his first younger sister who listens to him well..)

00:01:40.900 --> 00:01:45.600
(Sujan's older cousin and cute niece!)

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:53.640
My bro!

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:56.120
Sujan's cousin is a real brother for Sujan..

00:01:56.120 --> 00:02:00.200
And his nephew looks exactly same as Sujan when he was young.

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:04.960
Why are you so shy? We've not met for a long time!

00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:08.280
(Sujan got very excited because it's been a long time since he met his family.)

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:15.200
(Now, it's time to meet Sujan's parents and grandmother...)

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:18.680
(The traditional musicians are moving with serious looks again..).

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:26.800
(Welcoming crowd filled the whole road as Sujan's father prepared a surprise welcome-home party!)

00:02:27.240 --> 00:02:30.640
(Where is Sujan's home?)

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:34.220
(It seems like there are approximately 100 people!)

00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:37.440
(It looks like a pilgrimage also..)

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:40.140
The king! The king is here!

00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:44.760
Sujan is King??

00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:49.560
(What a dignified king,Sujan?!)

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:54.080
(But they seem like a frivolous global delegation!)

00:02:54.080 --> 00:02:57.120
(Exciting welcome home party day that woke up the quiet village!)
