here's the thing that makes life so

00:00:46.090 --> 00:00:48.900 
here's the thing that makes life so
interesting<00:00:47.040> the<00:00:48.040> theory<00:00:48.520> of<00:00:48.550> evolution

00:00:48.900 --> 00:00:48.910 
interesting the theory of evolution

maybe<00:00:52.900> so<00:00:53.260> maybe<00:00:53.820> so<00:00:54.820> but<00:00:56.040> the<00:00:57.040> theory<00:00:57.490> of

00:00:57.570 --> 00:00:57.580 
maybe so maybe so but the theory of

so<00:01:33.659> before<00:01:34.020> you<00:01:34.049> step<00:01:34.439> up<00:01:34.619> to<00:01:34.679> the<00:01:34.859> starting

00:01:35.359 --> 00:01:35.369

just remember out here the results don't

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:48.560 
just remember out here the results don't
always<00:01:44.130> add<00:01:44.490> up
