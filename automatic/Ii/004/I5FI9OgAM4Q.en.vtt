00:00:19.720 --> 00:00:27.050
 Hello dear lovers 

00:00:21.590 --> 00:00:31.000
 little sharp today will not be a description 

00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:33.850
 knife comparison of two knives 

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:41.320
 we have a bottom 

00:00:33.850 --> 00:00:41.320
 Ontario Ruslan original model and 1 

00:00:42.970 --> 00:00:51.950
 this is our Thai 

00:00:45.019 --> 00:00:58.780
 I do not know a copy is not a copy but also ontario 

00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:58.780
 rat but model 3 

00:00:59.980 --> 00:01:07.910
 ordered just check it out let's say how are they 

00:01:05.149 --> 00:01:13.729
 by doing but it turned out to be not so 

00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:15.920
 definitely now understand why it is 

00:01:13.729 --> 00:01:18.289
 start turning this knife in your hands 

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:20.960
 then came this one started spinning 

00:01:18.289 --> 00:01:24.280
 first noticed the feature of this knife 

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:29.659
 that he is heavier 

00:01:24.280 --> 00:01:31.840
 I began to find out the reasons for thinking that can 

00:01:29.659 --> 00:01:33.400
 we've got the original sawn liners 

00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:36.200
 nifiga 

00:01:33.400 --> 00:01:44.509
 here, of course, also did not drink 

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:52.640
 nothing and then took put two knives 

00:01:44.509 --> 00:01:54.850
 each other will see so handles 

00:01:52.640 --> 00:02:06.110
 compatible 

00:01:54.850 --> 00:02:10.670
 Firstly the Chinese are longer than everywhere on 

00:02:06.110 --> 00:02:11.570
 small but it's not shitov okay a little 

00:02:10.670 --> 00:02:16.450
 thicker . 

00:02:11.570 --> 00:02:19.610
 but not in this joke liners themselves 

00:02:16.450 --> 00:02:21.050
 visually I didnâ€™t measure but the liners on 

00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:28.730
 the chinese are fatter 

00:02:21.050 --> 00:02:38.470
 firstly secondly the blade is thicker in general 

00:02:28.730 --> 00:02:43.030
 this we have such bloated rats here 

00:02:38.470 --> 00:02:49.580
 show lessons here 

00:02:43.030 --> 00:02:55.239
 Chinese is right there in the hand 

00:02:49.580 --> 00:03:00.380
 the original is really model 3 

00:02:55.239 --> 00:03:04.720
 she comes with a kalencom clip down for 

00:03:00.380 --> 00:03:13.340
 I stopped wearing clip Torx roasted 

00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:15.140
 Surprisingly for the blades 

00:03:13.340 --> 00:03:21.560
 There is a special difference is not present only 

00:03:15.140 --> 00:03:27.769
 that the supply here is big enough 

00:03:21.560 --> 00:03:33.760
 thick information is not measured reluctance 

00:03:27.769 --> 00:03:33.760
 on my original here 

00:03:33.910 --> 00:03:40.870
 okay reduced here we are 

00:03:36.079 --> 00:03:40.870
 cry when the killing of what Krivenko 

00:03:41.400 --> 00:03:48.700
 i.e 

00:03:42.730 --> 00:03:52.209
 the wedge's line is a little different is given 

00:03:48.700 --> 00:03:56.350
 keeps thickness to the tip of the blade 

00:03:52.209 --> 00:03:56.730
 almost not so fast and loses at 

00:03:56.350 --> 00:04:04.319
 least 

00:03:56.730 --> 00:04:10.590
 Well, at the end, too, we cant 

00:04:04.319 --> 00:04:22.389
 washer washer at us than the washer is not visible well 

00:04:10.590 --> 00:04:27.419
 I guess that there is a first thing I see 

00:04:22.389 --> 00:04:34.770
 small secondly most likely they 

00:04:27.419 --> 00:04:39.130
 metal notches on the butt of the blade 

00:04:34.770 --> 00:04:44.580
 Chinese is more aggressive then here she is 

00:04:39.130 --> 00:04:48.760
 so smooth I am here she is so more 

00:04:44.580 --> 00:04:59.940
 the sawtooth does not stick hard on the finger 

00:04:48.760 --> 00:05:03.010
 it hurts that we have and in general the rest 

00:04:59.940 --> 00:05:08.400
 the model repeats the actual ontario 

00:05:03.010 --> 00:05:13.630
 this slightly inflate yankin is obtained 

00:05:08.400 --> 00:05:17.390
 Clip us not beautiful and immediately although all 

00:05:13.630 --> 00:05:22.970
 label attributes are present 

00:05:17.390 --> 00:05:22.970
 Well what can I say 

00:05:23.690 --> 00:05:31.700
 steel blades most likely but 8 

00:05:27.570 --> 00:05:33.960
 or analogue there what 440 something 

00:05:31.700 --> 00:05:37.070
 naturally not sharpened here took from the post office 

00:05:33.960 --> 00:05:37.070
 half an hour ago 

00:05:41.480 --> 00:05:52.610
 this blade at our liner is not worked out 

00:05:46.550 --> 00:05:56.550
 comes at the beginning is felt 

00:05:52.610 --> 00:06:00.440
 branded Chinese roughness when 

00:05:56.550 --> 00:06:00.440
 opening and closing the blade listen 

00:06:03.440 --> 00:06:13.590
 need to disassemble clean polish 

00:06:08.090 --> 00:06:17.580
 but what can I say I can say that our 

00:06:13.590 --> 00:06:21.420
 liked a hefty such 

00:06:17.580 --> 00:06:23.460
 and a net that is for lovers of knives 

00:06:21.420 --> 00:06:25.800
 Larger fit in principle that is 

00:06:23.460 --> 00:06:31.770
 rats are not small with us 

00:06:25.800 --> 00:06:35.040
 some do not like it but this little 

00:06:31.770 --> 00:06:35.570
 more that is for people with big 

00:06:35.040 --> 00:06:41.840
 by hand 

00:06:35.570 --> 00:06:44.630
 very comfortable and this is the thickness 

00:06:41.840 --> 00:06:47.730
 enlarged don't know hints like that 

00:06:44.630 --> 00:06:53.820
 a knife a little bit stronger should be 

00:06:47.730 --> 00:06:58.340
 I don't know how you can't prove it until 

00:06:53.820 --> 00:07:03.420
 let's test well and his mother is not going to 

00:06:58.340 --> 00:07:12.740
 Sorry, the living is not in Israel such things 

00:07:03.420 --> 00:07:17.310
 guys, look, in general, a good knife 

00:07:12.740 --> 00:07:21.360
 who wants to try to buy and 

00:07:17.310 --> 00:07:24.050
 check can be used as 

00:07:21.360 --> 00:07:24.050
 working knife 

00:07:26.150 --> 00:07:36.020
 These are the things the Chinese have gone mad 

00:07:30.650 --> 00:07:36.020
 thank you all for watching all bye
