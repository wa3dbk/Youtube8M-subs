you see on this video I'm going to show
you<00:00:04.980> how<00:00:05.190> to<00:00:05.220> take<00:00:05.580> off<00:00:05.790> the<00:00:06.560> the<00:00:07.560> positive

00:00:08.120 --> 00:00:08.130 
you how to take off the the positive

00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:14.860 
you how to take off the the positive
terminal<00:00:08.730> on<00:00:09.420> top<00:00:09.630> of<00:00:09.809> the<00:00:12.769> exhaust<00:00:13.769> manifold

00:00:14.860 --> 00:00:14.870 
terminal on top of the exhaust manifold

00:00:14.870 --> 00:00:16.189 
terminal on top of the exhaust manifold
whoa

00:00:16.189 --> 00:00:16.199 
whoa

00:00:16.199 --> 00:00:18.080 
whoa
as<00:00:16.590> you<00:00:16.710> can<00:00:16.830> see<00:00:17.039> this<00:00:17.190> is<00:00:17.369> off<00:00:17.490> the<00:00:17.670> vehicle

00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:18.090 
as you can see this is off the vehicle

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:21.230 
as you can see this is off the vehicle
so<00:00:18.470> just<00:00:19.470> imagine<00:00:19.740> that<00:00:20.609> this<00:00:20.820> was<00:00:20.970> on<00:00:21.150> the

00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:21.240 
so just imagine that this was on the

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:25.370 
so just imagine that this was on the
vehicle<00:00:21.660> it's<00:00:22.529> real<00:00:22.740> basic<00:00:22.980> and<00:00:23.400> simple<00:00:24.380> so

00:00:25.370 --> 00:00:25.380 
vehicle it's real basic and simple so

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:29.150 
vehicle it's real basic and simple so
pretty<00:00:25.800> much<00:00:27.080> what<00:00:28.080> it<00:00:28.230> takes<00:00:28.470> to<00:00:28.710> take<00:00:28.859> this

00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:29.160 
pretty much what it takes to take this

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:31.160 
pretty much what it takes to take this
off<00:00:29.369> you're<00:00:29.939> gonna<00:00:30.060> need<00:00:30.269> a<00:00:30.330> 19<00:00:30.929> millimeter

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:31.170 
off you're gonna need a 19 millimeter

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:44.420 
off you're gonna need a 19 millimeter
socket<00:00:40.280> right<00:00:41.280> there<00:00:41.750> 19<00:00:42.750> millimeter<00:00:43.430> and

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:44.430 
socket right there 19 millimeter and

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:48.560 
socket right there 19 millimeter and
this<00:00:44.700> will<00:00:44.910> fit<00:00:45.120> right<00:00:45.149> on<00:00:45.510> top<00:00:47.270> every<00:00:48.270> I

00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:48.570 
this will fit right on top every I

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:52.700 
this will fit right on top every I
already<00:00:48.809> had<00:00:48.960> this<00:00:49.110> loosened<00:00:49.680> so<00:00:51.500> so<00:00:52.500> I<00:00:52.530> can

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:52.710 
already had this loosened so so I can

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:55.400 
already had this loosened so so I can
make<00:00:52.829> a<00:00:52.860> short<00:00:53.129> video<00:00:53.600> so<00:00:54.600> pretty<00:00:55.020> much<00:00:55.199> once

00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:55.410 
make a short video so pretty much once

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:57.020 
make a short video so pretty much once
you<00:00:55.620> take<00:00:55.800> off<00:00:55.920> the<00:00:56.070> plastic<00:00:56.280> cover<00:00:56.640> that's<00:00:56.850> on

00:00:57.020 --> 00:00:57.030 
you take off the plastic cover that's on

00:00:57.030 --> 00:00:59.299 
you take off the plastic cover that's on
top<00:00:57.239> you<00:00:57.600> remove<00:00:58.020> it<00:00:58.170> you<00:00:58.230> can<00:00:58.649> have<00:00:58.800> access<00:00:58.980> to

two<00:01:16.860> clips<00:01:17.130> on<00:01:17.280> the<00:01:17.400> side<00:01:18.259> there's<00:01:19.259> the<00:01:19.500> one<00:01:19.680> on

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:19.890 
two clips on the side there's the one on

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:23.300 
two clips on the side there's the one on
this<00:01:20.520> side<00:01:20.759> so<00:01:21.590> what<00:01:22.590> you're<00:01:22.830> gonna<00:01:22.920> want<00:01:23.189> to

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:45.030 
remove the the positive terminal off of

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:48.880 
remove the the positive terminal off of
that<00:01:45.680> right<00:01:46.680> here<00:01:46.950> when<00:01:47.700> you're<00:01:47.880> removing<00:01:48.030> the

00:01:48.890 --> 00:01:55.700 
that right here when you're removing the
intake<00:01:49.890> manifold<00:01:50.399> thing<00:01:52.610> and<00:01:54.500> you<00:01:55.500> pretty

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:55.710 
intake manifold thing and you pretty

00:01:55.710 --> 00:01:57.649 
intake manifold thing and you pretty
much<00:01:55.829> this<00:01:56.430> is<00:01:56.549> what<00:01:56.729> you're<00:01:56.880> gonna<00:01:57.000> come

across
this<00:02:00.060> is<00:02:00.299> a<00:02:00.409> positive<00:02:01.409> terminal<00:02:01.970> and<00:02:02.970> then

00:02:03.730 --> 00:02:03.740 
this is a positive terminal and then

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:05.960 
this is a positive terminal and then
when<00:02:04.740> you're<00:02:04.920> down<00:02:05.130> there<00:02:05.340> doing<00:02:05.700> all<00:02:05.790> this

when you're down there doing all this
stuff<00:02:06.119> you'll<00:02:06.960> be<00:02:07.170> able<00:02:07.229> to<00:02:07.940> remove<00:02:08.940> this<00:02:09.270> off

00:02:10.070 --> 00:02:10.080 
stuff you'll be able to remove this off

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:13.880 
stuff you'll be able to remove this off
the<00:02:10.410> vehicle<00:02:11.630> this<00:02:12.630> is<00:02:12.750> gonna<00:02:12.870> be<00:02:13.110> this<00:02:13.380> this

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:13.890 
the vehicle this is gonna be this this

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:16.309 
the vehicle this is gonna be this this
sides<00:02:14.130> gonna<00:02:14.340> go<00:02:14.810> pretty<00:02:15.810> much<00:02:15.900> is<00:02:16.110> going<00:02:16.260> to

00:02:16.309 --> 00:02:16.319 
sides gonna go pretty much is going to

00:02:16.319 --> 00:02:19.100 
sides gonna go pretty much is going to
like<00:02:16.530> this<00:02:16.970> this<00:02:17.970> is<00:02:18.239> gonna<00:02:18.510> go<00:02:18.780> to<00:02:18.840> the

00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:19.110 
like this this is gonna go to the

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:22.070 
like this this is gonna go to the
starter<00:02:20.030> connect<00:02:21.030> it<00:02:21.150> to<00:02:21.239> the<00:02:21.360> starter<00:02:21.750> and

00:02:22.070 --> 00:02:22.080 
starter connect it to the starter and

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:24.559 
starter connect it to the starter and
then<00:02:22.470> this<00:02:22.709> side<00:02:22.920> is<00:02:23.010> gonna<00:02:23.160> they<00:02:23.880> just<00:02:24.330> cut

00:02:24.559 --> 00:02:24.569 
then this side is gonna they just cut

00:02:24.569 --> 00:02:26.150 
then this side is gonna they just cut
off<00:02:24.690> but<00:02:25.020> this<00:02:25.260> side<00:02:25.500> is<00:02:25.530> gonna<00:02:25.739> be<00:02:25.920> connected

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:26.160 
off but this side is gonna be connected

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:30.050 
off but this side is gonna be connected
to<00:02:26.459> the<00:02:26.550> alternator<00:02:27.290> so<00:02:28.290> that's<00:02:28.590> all<00:02:29.060> yeah

00:02:30.050 --> 00:02:30.060 
to the alternator so that's all yeah

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:34.040 
to the alternator so that's all yeah
that<00:02:30.510> it<00:02:30.690> is<00:02:30.720> so<00:02:31.850> that's<00:02:32.850> how<00:02:33.120> you<00:02:33.180> remove<00:02:33.720> the

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:34.050 
that it is so that's how you remove the

00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:38.540 
that it is so that's how you remove the
positive<00:02:36.110> terminal<00:02:37.110> off<00:02:37.440> the<00:02:37.709> intake

00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:38.550 
positive terminal off the intake

00:02:38.550 --> 00:02:41.840 
positive terminal off the intake
manifold<00:02:39.290> so<00:02:40.290> hopefully<00:02:40.830> it<00:02:41.310> gives<00:02:41.580> you<00:02:41.670> guys

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:41.850 
manifold so hopefully it gives you guys

00:02:41.850 --> 00:02:45.680 
manifold so hopefully it gives you guys
a<00:02:41.880> little<00:02:42.239> inside<00:02:42.739> view<00:02:43.739> of<00:02:43.920> it<00:02:44.540> okay

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:45.690 
a little inside view of it okay

00:02:45.690 --> 00:02:47.720 
a little inside view of it okay
