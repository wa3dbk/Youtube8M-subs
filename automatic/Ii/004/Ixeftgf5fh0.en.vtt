got better dirt in co2 you don't mean as

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:21.770 
got better dirt in co2 you don't mean as
much<00:02:18.450> lighting<00:02:18.810> and<00:02:19.590> it's<00:02:19.890> a<00:02:19.950> fact<00:02:20.160> but<00:02:20.460> uh<00:02:20.780> I'm

possible that way I really don't need as
much<00:02:27.510> lighting<00:02:27.780> because<00:02:28.200> I'm<00:02:28.950> doing<00:02:29.220> Asian

00:02:29.510 --> 00:02:29.520 
much lighting because I'm doing Asian

00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:33.440 
much lighting because I'm doing Asian
mostly<00:02:30.300> Asian<00:02:30.450> plants<00:02:31.080> and<00:02:31.230> um<00:02:31.400> only<00:02:32.400> 25%<00:02:33.120> of

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:33.450 
mostly Asian plants and um only 25% of

00:02:33.450 --> 00:02:35.800 
mostly Asian plants and um only 25% of
this<00:02:33.540> tank<00:02:33.780> will<00:02:33.900> be<00:02:33.959> Amazon<00:02:34.410> plants<00:02:34.860> so<00:02:35.070> uh

00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:35.810 
this tank will be Amazon plants so uh

00:02:35.810 --> 00:02:39.470 
this tank will be Amazon plants so uh
yeah<00:02:36.810> I'm<00:02:37.170> gonna<00:02:37.290> need<00:02:37.470> a<00:02:37.530> lot<00:02:37.890> of<00:02:38.480> Asian

00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:47.610 
I'm gonna do a little thicker layer than

00:02:47.610 --> 00:02:51.580 
I'm gonna do a little thicker layer than
this<00:02:47.790> but<00:02:48.480> uh<00:02:48.890> just<00:02:49.890> getting<00:02:50.459> it<00:02:50.610> down<00:02:50.790> and

after this I mean I'm not really worried
about<00:02:54.239> how<00:02:54.540> the<00:02:54.600> layer<00:02:54.870> goes<00:02:55.400> calcium

00:02:56.390 --> 00:02:56.400 
about how the layer goes calcium

00:02:56.400 --> 00:03:00.290 
about how the layer goes calcium
laterite<00:02:56.989> peat<00:02:57.989> moss<00:02:58.230> whatever<00:02:59.239> I'm<00:03:00.239> not

00:03:00.290 --> 00:03:00.300 
laterite peat moss whatever I'm not

00:03:00.300 --> 00:03:02.690 
laterite peat moss whatever I'm not
really<00:03:00.540> worried<00:03:00.989> about<00:03:01.170> how<00:03:01.980> the<00:03:02.040> layers<00:03:02.310> go

00:03:02.690 --> 00:03:02.700 
really worried about how the layers go

00:03:02.700 --> 00:03:04.400 
really worried about how the layers go
but<00:03:03.239> I<00:03:03.300> definitely<00:03:03.720> want<00:03:03.900> to<00:03:03.989> get<00:03:04.110> some<00:03:04.170> other

00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:04.410 
but I definitely want to get some other

00:03:04.410 --> 00:03:06.979 
but I definitely want to get some other
minerals<00:03:04.950> in<00:03:05.040> here<00:03:05.280> right<00:03:05.940> now<00:03:05.970> I've<00:03:06.239> got<00:03:06.390> Pete

minerals in here right now I've got Pete

00:03:06.989 --> 00:03:08.630 
minerals in here right now I've got Pete
and<00:03:07.170> now<00:03:07.290> I've<00:03:07.380> got<00:03:07.410> counting<00:03:07.980> calcium<00:03:08.549> in

00:03:08.630 --> 00:03:08.640 
and now I've got counting calcium in

00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:12.350 
and now I've got counting calcium in
here<00:03:08.820> and<00:03:09.060> I<00:03:10.400> really<00:03:11.400> want<00:03:11.610> to<00:03:11.670> get<00:03:11.730> iron<00:03:11.970> and

just see what I can't do to get some
some<00:03:24.239> basic<00:03:24.690> plant<00:03:25.200> minerals<00:03:25.739> that<00:03:25.890> are<00:03:25.950> vital

00:03:26.390 --> 00:03:26.400 
some basic plant minerals that are vital

00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:29.300 
some basic plant minerals that are vital
for<00:03:26.430> them<00:03:26.730> in<00:03:27.030> here<00:03:27.660> co2<00:03:28.290> I'm<00:03:28.500> not<00:03:28.739> connecting

I don't want to fiddle around with it I
like<00:03:49.470> doing<00:03:49.739> liquid<00:03:49.920> co2<00:03:50.280> better<00:03:50.700> because

00:03:51.080 --> 00:03:51.090 
like doing liquid co2 better because

00:03:51.090 --> 00:03:52.580 
like doing liquid co2 better because
that<00:03:51.120> way<00:03:51.450> I<00:03:51.480> know<00:03:51.690> what<00:03:52.110> I'm<00:03:52.170> putting<00:03:52.500> in

00:03:52.580 --> 00:03:52.590 
that way I know what I'm putting in

00:03:52.590 --> 00:03:54.589 
that way I know what I'm putting in
there<00:03:52.799> and

00:03:54.589 --> 00:03:54.599 
there and

00:03:54.599 --> 00:03:57.170

the others thanks looking good the

00:03:57.180 --> 00:03:58.580 
the others thanks looking good the
plants<00:03:57.480> could<00:03:57.569> probably<00:03:57.750> live<00:03:57.989> in<00:03:58.110> this<00:03:58.230> alone

00:03:58.580 --> 00:03:58.590 
plants could probably live in this alone

00:03:58.590 --> 00:04:00.110 
plants could probably live in this alone
but<00:03:58.890> uh<00:03:58.950> we're<00:03:59.430> definitely<00:03:59.519> in<00:03:59.790> again<00:03:59.969> some

00:04:00.110 --> 00:04:00.120 
but uh we're definitely in again some

00:04:40.370 --> 00:04:40.380 
later but uh probably maybe a little

00:04:40.380 --> 00:04:43.249 
later but uh probably maybe a little
over<00:04:40.740> two<00:04:41.729> centimeters<00:04:42.240> and<00:04:42.419> deepest<00:04:42.840> part<00:04:43.050> I

00:04:43.249 --> 00:04:43.259 
over two centimeters and deepest part I

00:04:43.259 --> 00:04:46.520 
over two centimeters and deepest part I
mean<00:04:43.770> it's<00:04:43.949> like<00:04:44.940> a<00:04:45.000> centimeter<00:04:45.509> thick<00:04:46.110> and

00:04:46.520 --> 00:04:46.530
