you open it um you see the flaming hot
product<00:02:32.269> in<00:02:32.510> here<00:02:33.140> I'm<00:02:33.769> going<00:02:33.920> to<00:02:33.980> go<00:02:34.340> for<00:02:34.610> it

00:02:42.569 --> 00:02:42.579 

00:02:42.579 --> 00:02:44.890 

hmm<00:02:43.579> this<00:02:43.879> thing<00:02:44.120> doesn't<00:02:44.360> taste<00:02:44.629> any

00:02:44.890 --> 00:02:44.900 
hmm this thing doesn't taste any

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:48.720 
hmm this thing doesn't taste any
different<00:02:45.410> than<00:02:46.040> the<00:02:46.459> flaming<00:02:46.970> hot<00:02:47.209> cheetos

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:48.730 
different than the flaming hot cheetos

00:02:48.730 --> 00:02:51.940 
different than the flaming hot cheetos
but<00:02:49.730> they're<00:02:50.120> exactly<00:02:50.599> the<00:02:50.780> same<00:02:50.930> I<00:02:51.379> think<00:02:51.769> the

00:02:51.940 --> 00:02:51.950 
but they're exactly the same I think the

00:02:51.950 --> 00:02:54.729 
but they're exactly the same I think the
theory<00:02:52.489> of<00:02:52.519> sriracha<00:02:53.260> find<00:02:54.260> it<00:02:54.379> works<00:02:54.560> here

00:02:54.729 --> 00:02:54.739 
theory of sriracha find it works here

00:02:54.739 --> 00:02:56.920 
theory of sriracha find it works here
because<00:02:55.519> like<00:02:55.700> you<00:02:55.940> can<00:02:56.150> put<00:02:56.299> sriracha<00:02:56.480> on

00:02:56.920 --> 00:02:56.930 
because like you can put sriracha on

00:02:56.930 --> 00:03:00.009 
because like you can put sriracha on
anything<00:02:57.349> and<00:02:57.650> you'll<00:02:58.400> love<00:02:58.819> that<00:02:59.329> food<00:02:59.690> so

00:03:00.009 --> 00:03:00.019 
anything and you'll love that food so

00:03:00.019 --> 00:03:03.220 
anything and you'll love that food so
the<00:03:00.769> flamin<00:03:01.250> hot<00:03:01.489> is<00:03:01.760> the<00:03:02.150> white<00:03:02.930> people

00:03:03.220 --> 00:03:03.230 
the flamin hot is the white people

00:03:03.230 --> 00:03:05.890 
the flamin hot is the white people
equivalent<00:03:04.040> of<00:03:04.190> sriracha<00:03:04.730> and<00:03:05.120> when<00:03:05.750> you<00:03:05.870> have

00:03:05.890 --> 00:03:05.900 
equivalent of sriracha and when you have

00:03:05.900 --> 00:03:07.390 
equivalent of sriracha and when you have
the<00:03:06.170> flamin<00:03:06.500> hot<00:03:06.650> they<00:03:06.829> all<00:03:07.040> taste<00:03:07.280> the<00:03:07.340> same

00:03:07.390 --> 00:03:07.400 
the flamin hot they all taste the same

00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:09.460 
the flamin hot they all taste the same
and<00:03:07.760> you<00:03:07.879> will<00:03:08.000> like<00:03:08.150> it<00:03:08.329> so<00:03:08.720> it's<00:03:08.900> exactly

00:03:09.460 --> 00:03:09.470
