00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:57.090
 bright ice you just have to the left 

00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:58.860
 and you go to castle ruins 

00:01:57.090 --> 00:02:00.719

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:02.460
 access the wind of cards agp yard 

00:02:00.719 --> 00:02:04.950

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:07.079
 key to the ruins of the house of cards 

00:02:06.869 --> 00:02:08.160
 hagen 

00:02:07.079 --> 00:02:10.380
 we must do all 

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:11.580
 the dungeon which is pretty big but does not 

00:02:10.380 --> 00:02:13.980
 do not worry there are no enemies 

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:15.870
 super beefy there are just small 

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:17.580
 goblins just small killed riklin and 

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:20.400
 but you will have to enter 

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:21.870
 right there in this cave in these 

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:23.880
 caves of the castle since I size makes 

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:25.170
 the castle basements here you are 

00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:27.690
 have to do all the basements for 

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:30.060
 access to the ruins of the castle is that 

00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:32.130
 there you 're just going 

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:33.930
 really invoked the because this tag for the 

00:02:32.130 --> 00:02:35.940
 kill as I 'm going to show you everything from 

00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:37.380
 then go of course in the 

00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:38.670
 caves not in the ruins if that's the 

00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:40.230
 first time you come if you 

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:43.200
 have already been there and if you have 

00:02:40.230 --> 00:02:45.420
 picked up the chalk the act is safe on the 

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:47.220
 body of a decline just right one rolls to 

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:49.140
 you can say it's directly 

00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:50.910
 access to the ruins of the castle dakar 

00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:53.930
 style so here we are castle ruins 

00:02:50.910 --> 00:02:56.730
 of castagne normally if you will 

00:02:53.930 --> 00:02:59.460
 do it the first time it's this dungeon 

00:02:56.730 --> 00:03:02.610
 you go to this court by the ap 

00:02:59.460 --> 00:03:06.090
 through this cave and after you grab the 

00:03:02.610 --> 00:03:08.190
 key on the klein rice that climbed by 

00:03:06.090 --> 00:03:09.900
 a wild boar one can talk to one another 

00:03:08.190 --> 00:03:12.480
 who rides the riklin that show a 

00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:15.300
 warthog so here after the you 

00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:18.300
 access to our friend's throne because this tag 

00:03:15.300 --> 00:03:22.110
 and this one we will continue our 

00:03:18.300 --> 00:03:25.680
 dear tutor just waited ormat a little 

00:03:22.110 --> 00:03:26.940
 thing done I just got it back the 

00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:28.709
 reticle because you see now 

00:03:26.940 --> 00:03:30.690
 I have the g the viewfinder before I had spent 

00:03:28.709 --> 00:03:31.860
 because I am simply reporting for 

00:03:30.690 --> 00:03:33.990
 making screenshots for 

00:03:31.860 --> 00:03:35.730
 thumbnails here is the reason any case 

00:03:33.990 --> 00:03:37.380
 you see no viewfinder now he 

00:03:35.730 --> 00:03:39.209
 is there the viewfinder so you go there and 

00:03:37.380 --> 00:03:40.980
 you're going active is simply 

00:03:39.209 --> 00:03:43.050
 as soon as you have the super g skull 

00:03:40.980 --> 00:03:44.220
 obviously not going to activate that napias that 

00:03:43.050 --> 00:03:46.709
 up time of crash 

00:03:44.220 --> 00:03:48.959
 first of all small advice before 

00:03:46.709 --> 00:03:50.280
 to begin this quest 

00:03:48.959 --> 00:03:53.430
 I advise you to have a lot 

00:03:50.280 --> 00:03:55.380
 a lot a lot of life potions so 

00:03:53.430 --> 00:03:57.510
 of need simply if you want 

00:03:55.380 --> 00:03:59.910
 face him face to face because because 

00:03:57.510 --> 00:04:00.930
 this tag is really but very very 

00:03:59.910 --> 00:04:03.450
 beefy 

00:04:00.930 --> 00:04:05.010
 in one shot they'll goals almost at 

00:04:03.450 --> 00:04:06.989
 waterside second it's sure you 

00:04:05.010 --> 00:04:09.630
 are mans so valid so he is very 

00:04:06.989 --> 00:04:10.950
 powerful and then as soon as you turn on the 

00:04:09.630 --> 00:04:12.840
 Cap d'Agde mask 

00:04:10.950 --> 00:04:14.220
 do you break in running because it will clear 

00:04:12.840 --> 00:04:15.230
 a phenomenal power 

00:04:14.220 --> 00:04:17.570
 here 

00:04:15.230 --> 00:04:18.530
 here you are not clearing otherwise you are going 

00:04:17.570 --> 00:04:20.570
 simply burst 

00:04:18.530 --> 00:04:23.479
 after the second tip that I you 

00:04:20.570 --> 00:04:24.860
 gives for those who have a level not 

00:04:23.479 --> 00:04:26.210
 terrible like me if you do not have 

00:04:24.860 --> 00:04:28.160
 place because that you just climb 

00:04:26.210 --> 00:04:30.889
 shame of this hill the spike the fourth 

00:04:28.160 --> 00:04:32.389
 sags is not going to see you at all so 

00:04:30.889 --> 00:04:35.060
 you see I'm at the top of this 

00:04:32.389 --> 00:04:35.570
 hill see it's really the opposite of the 

00:04:35.060 --> 00:04:37.250
 throne 

00:04:35.570 --> 00:04:38.510
 you put there it's a little trick 

00:04:37.250 --> 00:04:39.500
 that I found by chance 

00:04:38.510 --> 00:04:41.479
 punctuated in fact 

00:04:39.500 --> 00:04:43.010
 in fact I was having fun killing a shot of 

00:04:41.479 --> 00:04:44.810
 arrows but by jumping I'm I 

00:04:43.010 --> 00:04:46.970
 dead full of times called taku just 

00:04:44.810 --> 00:04:48.560
 but I jumped on it I got and I 

00:04:46.970 --> 00:04:50.570
 I jumped on this little 

00:04:48.560 --> 00:04:52.610
 hill there and then a barrel access card 

00:04:50.570 --> 00:04:54.560
 deep down and then I said to myself 

00:04:52.610 --> 00:04:57.380
 I found the trick hen you easily 

00:04:54.560 --> 00:04:59.780
 so if you are a winner if you are 

00:04:57.380 --> 00:05:00.860
 a if you are a handsome kid if you 

00:04:59.780 --> 00:05:03.410
 have a sick level 

00:05:00.860 --> 00:05:05.060
 do not worry go ahead I believe 

00:05:03.410 --> 00:05:07.100
 in shocking you or killing them without this 

00:05:05.060 --> 00:05:09.949
 little trick if you have a level of 

00:05:07.100 --> 00:05:10.460
 shit like me in this part level 

00:05:09.949 --> 00:05:13.250
 31 

00:05:10.460 --> 00:05:14.870
 go go on this hill there 

00:05:13.250 --> 00:05:17.030
 as I showed you 

00:05:14.870 --> 00:05:19.550
 and then they will not see you and you will 

00:05:17.030 --> 00:05:21.680
 to attack from afar with anarch 

00:05:19.550 --> 00:05:23.750
 I will show you it works all 

00:05:21.680 --> 00:05:25.760
 just for those who do not believe me 

00:05:23.750 --> 00:05:28.669
 so you simply attack it at 

00:05:25.760 --> 00:05:30.200
 the bow or they all have me in addition they 

00:05:28.669 --> 00:05:31.700
 not move you see it will not come 

00:05:30.200 --> 00:05:32.870
 towards you he will not move from there he 

00:05:31.700 --> 00:05:35.090
 will stay at the bottom because we are doing 

00:05:32.870 --> 00:05:36.889
 he does not know where exactly you are so 

00:05:35.090 --> 00:05:39.650
 here you have call aim all 

00:05:36.889 --> 00:05:41.690
 simply he will move kaka is removed the 

00:05:39.650 --> 00:05:43.460
 life little by little until you kill him it's 

00:05:41.690 --> 00:05:44.690
 like that I grew small 

00:05:43.460 --> 00:05:46.700
 valid trick against it was necessary 

00:05:44.690 --> 00:05:48.800
 really fast because you see that 

00:05:46.700 --> 00:05:51.139
 his life is very very 

00:05:48.800 --> 00:05:53.569
 So that's it for the little trick 

00:05:51.139 --> 00:05:56.629
 for what really can not kill 

00:05:53.569 --> 00:05:58.550
 our dear friend cash tag so I you 

00:05:56.629 --> 00:06:00.110
 give an appointment for the rest I have a 

00:05:58.550 --> 00:06:02.270
 little memory for that for you 

00:06:00.110 --> 00:06:03.860
 show so by killing the agde guy the 

00:06:02.270 --> 00:06:06.020
 worm table to see that you win so 

00:06:03.860 --> 00:06:09.319
 at once I charge you this 

00:06:06.020 --> 00:06:13.099
 part here so that's killing our dear 

00:06:09.319 --> 00:06:14.780
 friend the cap d'agde you win his mind 

00:06:13.099 --> 00:06:16.310
 in fact you can use it when 

00:06:14.780 --> 00:06:17.900
 you do not want to be wanted but three 

00:06:16.310 --> 00:06:19.009
 times a day actually I'm going to you 

00:06:17.900 --> 00:06:20.599
 show right away you win this 

00:06:19.009 --> 00:06:22.370
 power makes it the vocation of karlstad 

00:06:20.599 --> 00:06:23.629
 you invoke because this tag who are fighting 

00:06:22.370 --> 00:06:25.759
 by your side for a hundred and twenty seconds 

00:06:23.629 --> 00:06:27.949
 and usable again twice 

00:06:25.759 --> 00:06:31.240
 only outdoors you can 

00:06:27.949 --> 00:06:33.469
 you can only use it so 

00:06:31.240 --> 00:06:36.139
 three times a day it seems to me 

00:06:33.469 --> 00:06:38.389
 after that get back up to date so here is 

00:06:36.139 --> 00:06:40.879
 it's a very very powerful power 

00:06:38.389 --> 00:06:43.039
 if I'm not mistaken it's recovering from you 

00:06:40.879 --> 00:06:44.300
 tell me if it does not recover if that 

00:06:43.039 --> 00:06:44.800
 disappears completely not I could not 

00:06:44.300 --> 00:06:47.389
 test 

00:06:44.800 --> 00:06:49.490
 frankly it's been a while since I 

00:06:47.389 --> 00:06:50.569
 this power there but I use them 

00:06:49.490 --> 00:06:53.270
 only once as you can the 

00:06:50.569 --> 00:06:55.789
 see so sorry if I interrupt you 

00:06:53.270 --> 00:06:57.259
 so as I told you I used it 

00:06:55.789 --> 00:06:58.759
 only once so I do not know if 

00:06:57.259 --> 00:06:59.870
 it's 3 times a day that you can
