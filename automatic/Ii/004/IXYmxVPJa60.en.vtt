00:00:01.070 --> 00:00:06.450
 hello to all so we have me today 

00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:08.069
 I want to please you with another interesting 

00:00:06.450 --> 00:00:10.590
 ballerina bowl from the kitchen 

00:00:08.069 --> 00:00:13.519
 This pancha is called contraband then 

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:15.570
 have this content being prepared 

00:00:13.519 --> 00:00:19.380
 mostly from here so black 

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:23.000
 beans yes yes do not be surprised 

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:26.670
 even a bean you can cook panther 

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:29.099
 beans while it means farce to us 

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:32.610
 need 200 grams i.e. one 

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:35.910
 a glass and then 200 grams special 

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:40.040
 3 glasses of water is needed ie 600 

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:44.670
 milliliters of water then on this amount 

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:48.629
 water and beans and we will need 5 

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:50.879
 tablespoons of soy sauce means 4 

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:54.449
 tablespoons of sugar 

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:57.120
 syrup yuri ganga either possible and how 

00:00:54.449 --> 00:00:59.690
 happen to hire called olegu yes 

00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:04.290
 i.e. these are oligosaccharides 

00:00:59.690 --> 00:01:07.070
 here it is so thick very often 

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:08.909
 used kitchen 

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:14.729
 form and 

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:18.780
 it is necessary to boil water almost gave away 

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:19.619
 total disappearance means we will 

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:22.439
 boil down 

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:27.960
 and you need to constantly stir well 

00:01:22.439 --> 00:01:29.540
 at least every five minutes so here are ours 

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:34.100
 beans boil 

00:01:29.540 --> 00:01:38.369
 there will be a lot of you so far 

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:44.040
 formed foam foam better smartly 

00:01:38.369 --> 00:01:45.750
 remove though carrisi &amp; bloggers who 

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:53.430
 says need to delete who says not 

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:56.759
 need to delete, I would rather not know better 

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:58.909
 hit maybe some point in this 

00:01:56.759 --> 00:01:58.909
 there is 

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:10.880
 that's already been 30 years but there is still a photo 

00:02:07.729 --> 00:02:13.790
 did not come to terms with why we need 

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:17.050
 Stir the beans do not like 

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:21.080
 too sticky while there is water yes but 

00:02:17.050 --> 00:02:24.730
 stirring is necessary to this 

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:28.989
 beans evenly fell that is and 

00:02:24.730 --> 00:02:33.160
 lower layers as if to higher up 

00:02:28.989 --> 00:02:35.330
 the upper ones so that also below is enough 

00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:36.260
 boiled because the beans themselves 

00:02:35.330 --> 00:02:39.620
 yourself tough 

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:43.010
 that is passed to it as would not dare and 

00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:46.790
 still generally speak more truly blocks I write 

00:02:43.010 --> 00:02:50.330
 so it is better to soak the beans for 

00:02:46.790 --> 00:02:54.380
 two or three hours but honestly i'm not in 

00:02:50.330 --> 00:02:57.220
 urine because i'm used to how 

00:02:54.380 --> 00:03:00.799
 preparing mother-in-law that is, she seems to be 

00:02:57.220 --> 00:03:04.700
 beans do not soak naturally for 

00:03:00.799 --> 00:03:08.870
 I have such a first option now 

00:03:04.700 --> 00:03:11.660
 out of habit is preferred when 

00:03:08.870 --> 00:03:14.480
 what kind of cooking is not too much 

00:03:11.660 --> 00:03:20.030
 tough but if she soaks it look 

00:03:14.480 --> 00:03:23.350
 too soft that is already according to mine 

00:03:20.030 --> 00:03:25.850
 there is no habit but something 

00:03:23.350 --> 00:03:28.220
 who like as if too soft 

00:03:25.850 --> 00:03:32.019
 love can and younger section 

00:03:28.220 --> 00:03:32.019
 two or three hours and then cook 

00:03:32.940 --> 00:03:38.400
 by the way instead of beans black yes you can 

00:03:36.360 --> 00:03:41.760
 use red beans really not 

00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:43.970
 know maybe taste a little bit be 

00:03:41.760 --> 00:03:47.970
 differ because the section is different 

00:03:43.970 --> 00:03:50.010
 because more likely I did not meet red 

00:03:47.970 --> 00:03:54.560
 beans are naturally made from red pasta not 

00:03:50.010 --> 00:03:57.870
 cooked in general karinka can still 

00:03:54.560 --> 00:03:58.560
 cook from ground nuts that is from 

00:03:57.870 --> 00:04:01.950
 peanuts then 

00:03:58.560 --> 00:04:04.230
 although I did n’t like it, but I don’t like 

00:04:01.950 --> 00:04:08.180
 peanuts are therefore as if with a peanut special 

00:04:04.230 --> 00:04:11.280
 I did not have such enthusiasm 

00:04:08.180 --> 00:04:15.500
 so here we have a total passed 

00:04:11.280 --> 00:04:21.690
 40 minutes a little water and I have left 

00:04:15.500 --> 00:04:26.630
 a little more maybe a dream can 

00:04:21.690 --> 00:04:30.330
 be less than half a cup to 

00:04:26.630 --> 00:04:33.440
 just a little bit now we need 

00:04:30.330 --> 00:04:33.440
 will add soy sauce 

00:04:41.129 --> 00:04:48.619
 add soy sauce size in 

00:04:43.739 --> 00:04:48.619
 5 tablespoons 

00:04:59.760 --> 00:05:05.040
 after adding soy sauce 

00:05:01.460 --> 00:05:08.640
 you need to wait for it practically 

00:05:05.040 --> 00:05:10.920
 full with water and evaporation 

00:05:08.640 --> 00:05:14.240
 only after that our syrup is added 

00:05:10.920 --> 00:05:16.590
 because if along with soy sauce 

00:05:14.240 --> 00:05:20.880
 what else syrup in wolmido 

00:05:16.590 --> 00:05:25.410
 then get something like the effect of openwork 

00:05:20.880 --> 00:05:32.550
 sugar wait another 5 5 minutes bye 

00:05:25.410 --> 00:05:35.060
 brewing our liquid while stirring 

00:05:32.550 --> 00:05:35.060
 necessarily 

00:05:40.350 --> 00:05:48.690
 and here I have been five minutes I 

00:05:43.290 --> 00:05:52.440
 gas is high so five minutes is not 

00:05:48.690 --> 00:05:57.470
 enough to evaporate water means 

00:05:52.440 --> 00:05:57.470
 syrup add Palestinian forward pieces 

00:06:25.569 --> 00:06:37.149
 and so here is our panchan 

00:06:34.029 --> 00:06:39.789
 which is called concha bank ready as 

00:06:37.149 --> 00:06:41.529
 see it looks pretty appetizing 

00:06:39.789 --> 00:06:44.399
 and for beauty 

00:06:41.529 --> 00:06:47.409
 you can still add sesame seeds 

00:06:44.399 --> 00:06:49.929
 really need to add after cooking 

00:06:47.409 --> 00:06:52.419
 that is, when he gets ready because 

00:06:49.929 --> 00:06:56.319
 adding while cooking i we risk 

00:06:52.419 --> 00:07:00.659
 all that data sesame that is white 

00:06:56.319 --> 00:07:00.659
 sesame and families can become smart 

00:07:01.259 --> 00:07:08.499
 wait until pancha becomes and you can 

00:07:04.439 --> 00:07:10.619
 packaged in small containers and clean 

00:07:08.499 --> 00:07:10.619
 in the fridge
