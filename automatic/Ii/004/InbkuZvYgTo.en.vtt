00:00:00.230 --> 00:00:04.670
 hello girls how are you welcome 

00:00:02.389 --> 00:00:07.069
 day more to the channel on today's 

00:00:04.670 --> 00:00:09.139
 I bring this tutorial using the 

00:00:07.069 --> 00:00:10.820
 palette get them to propagate that is a 

00:00:09.139 --> 00:00:13.369
 video that many of you were 

00:00:10.820 --> 00:00:15.949
 waiting for the first thing I'm going to do is 

00:00:13.369 --> 00:00:18.019
 use this first one that is a sample 

00:00:15.949 --> 00:00:19.640
 that came with the palette and I'm going to 

00:00:18.019 --> 00:00:22.189
 Apply throughout the era of the mobile eyelid 

00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:24.710
 and the first color that I'm going to use is 

00:00:22.189 --> 00:00:27.079
 the color card and I will apply it in the 

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:31.630
 area of ​​the mobile eyelid and I'll take it 

00:00:27.079 --> 00:00:31.630
 a little bit towards the area of ​​the basin 

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:50.450
 the next step that I'm taking to 

00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:53.060
 out and using a brush 

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:56.390
 blur clean in this case I'm 

00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:58.460
 using the 25 sigma and what 

00:00:56.390 --> 00:01:00.410
 I do is blur the corners of the 

00:00:58.460 --> 00:01:03.559
 meat color is applied so that 

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:06.729
 there is a very smoky effect and an effect 

00:01:03.559 --> 00:01:06.729
 well clean in color 

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:14.240
 the next color that I'm going to use is 

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:16.310
 the liverpool and this I am using 

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:19.950
 a brush so I'm using it 

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:22.500
 a flat brush of January 

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:25.020
 I am applying the outermost area of 

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:27.030
 eye in the form of v and I am 

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:30.270
 concentrating in the area of ​​the basin and 

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:31.770
 the outermost area of ​​the eye now I'm going to 

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:34.200
 use the same brush as 

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:39.250
 I used now to blur the union 

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:41.320
 between liverpool and the cardinal 

00:01:39.250 --> 00:01:43.420
 the next color that useful I'm going to 

00:01:41.320 --> 00:01:46.840
 use is the express and this I am going to 

00:01:43.420 --> 00:01:48.760
 apply using the 45 sigma and 

00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:50.710
 I'm applying it from the area 

00:01:48.760 --> 00:01:52.690
 external eye in the area of ​​the basin 

00:01:50.710 --> 00:01:55.690
 and I'm taking it around 

00:01:52.690 --> 00:01:58.119
 towards the middle of the eye and again 

00:01:55.690 --> 00:01:59.740
 I'm using the 25 sigma to 

00:01:58.119 --> 00:02:01.930
 blur the union between all 

00:01:59.740 --> 00:02:03.850
 colors now I will use again 

00:02:01.930 --> 00:02:05.530
 the color activate body and I'm 

00:02:03.850 --> 00:02:08.860
 using a good hair brush 

00:02:05.530 --> 00:02:11.620
 cortitos and I'm applying it in the 

00:02:08.860 --> 00:02:14.020
 outer part of lower eyelid east 

00:02:11.620 --> 00:02:16.900
 same process I'm going to do with the 

00:02:14.020 --> 00:02:19.630
 card but in this case I'm going to 

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:22.800
 Apply in the area in the center of the eye 

00:02:19.630 --> 00:02:22.800
 in the lower eyelid 

00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:35.210
 Now I'm going to take the color coat and 

00:02:33.590 --> 00:02:37.460
 using the same brush I will 

00:02:35.210 --> 00:02:39.920
 apply it in the innermost area of 

00:02:37.460 --> 00:02:43.310
 lower eyelid and this is to give it 

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:46.040
 light and give a more special touch to 

00:02:43.310 --> 00:02:49.250
 make up the last shadow that I'm going to 

00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:51.800
 use in the shade cream and this 

00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:53.960
 I'm going to use to illuminate the arch of 

00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:57.400
 eyebrows and I'm going to blur it 

00:02:53.960 --> 00:02:57.400
 using my fingers 

00:02:58.720 --> 00:03:02.770
 after applying the shadow that I am 

00:03:00.880 --> 00:03:05.530
 using another brush to blur is 

00:03:02.770 --> 00:03:07.390
 of children use a clean brush and the 

00:03:05.530 --> 00:03:10.150
 I'm using to make sure that 

00:03:07.390 --> 00:03:12.370
 the union between all the colors 

00:03:10.150 --> 00:03:15.420
 as clean and as perfect as possible 

00:03:12.370 --> 00:03:18.240
 after this I will use 

00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:23.130
 nor delineate favorite for the moment is it 

00:03:18.240 --> 00:03:26.610
 he forgot the image of the pac of the tube 

00:03:23.130 --> 00:03:29.060

00:03:38.290 --> 00:03:43.780

00:03:41.190 --> 00:03:46.830

00:03:43.780 --> 00:03:48.600
 and sexy sensual to the eyes 

00:03:46.830 --> 00:03:50.590
 what I'm going to do now is that I'm going to 

00:03:48.600 --> 00:03:53.769
 delineate the line 

00:03:50.590 --> 00:03:55.810

00:03:53.769 --> 00:03:57.160

 it leaves super long super defined and I 

00:04:09.190 --> 00:04:13.720
 love it and for three dollars I think it's 

00:04:11.170 --> 00:04:16.900
 excellent for the lifting I will use 

00:04:13.720 --> 00:04:20.620
