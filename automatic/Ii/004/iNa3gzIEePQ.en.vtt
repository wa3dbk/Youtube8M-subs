00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.480
 hello my name is code and today I 

00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:12.450
 I want to show many of those who do not have 

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:16.100
 licensed minecraft as you can 

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:23.910
 get it for free 

00:00:16.100 --> 00:00:30.119
 we only need to program this lo 

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:35.270
 the link will be in the description and this program 

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:40.410
 we have how to say it generates gift keys 

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:44.789
 which can lead him well in the official 

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:51.170
 site mikecroft and get a license 

00:00:44.789 --> 00:00:51.170
 mine crafting is we introduce here any number 

00:00:51.260 --> 00:01:03.629
 for example, this is what we generated 

00:00:57.079 --> 00:01:07.830
 wholesale well shorter and doofig keys since 

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:12.240
 here they cannot be copied then she 

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:17.490
 a new notebook is created it is called 

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:22.220
 Kodos and these keys are likely 

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:31.730
 the fact that they can match that is 

00:01:22.220 --> 00:01:35.810
 are likely somewhere may percent 1510 that 

00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:39.010
 match the key I have not yet experienced give 

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:44.410
 because as soon as I saw him 

00:01:39.010 --> 00:01:51.170
 started shooting by the way it was not I created 

00:01:44.410 --> 00:01:54.010
 so well, I'm telling you here is the probability 

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:54.010
 small 

00:01:54.040 --> 00:02:01.790
 so try this one in general somewhere with 

00:01:59.810 --> 00:02:07.250
 attempts 10 20 

00:02:01.790 --> 00:02:09.229
 you can obtain the necessary 

00:02:07.250 --> 00:02:16.040
 it will work out because if you want something 

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:23.209
 you can do everything just damn meinkravt 

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:25.670
 It costs 800 rubles. I do not know this either. 

00:02:23.209 --> 00:02:29.709
 some game that weighs 50 megabytes 

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:34.010
 paying 20 euros is a robbery so 

00:02:29.709 --> 00:02:37.670
 many people don't like it 

00:02:34.010 --> 00:02:44.239
 I think, and I, too, so many want 

00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:47.060
 play the free version and how you 

00:02:44.239 --> 00:02:49.280
 there are no more exits except how to download 

00:02:47.060 --> 00:02:54.709
 a pirated version that probably still does not 

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:55.340
 came out because there was a new version 161 

00:02:54.709 --> 00:02:58.420
 like 

00:02:55.340 --> 00:03:02.780
 or generally they have a new launcher there 

00:02:58.420 --> 00:03:05.299
 new protections so on i think i am you all 

00:03:02.780 --> 00:03:10.650
 showed if you liked the video 

00:03:05.299 --> 00:03:15.799
 like this by the way this is my first video 

00:03:10.650 --> 00:03:15.799
 and so far
