00:02:53.880 --> 00:02:53.890 
think that's why he was able to place

00:02:53.890 --> 00:02:55.260 
think that's why he was able to place
along<00:02:54.190> in<00:02:54.310> NBA<00:02:54.580> because<00:02:54.820> he<00:02:55.000> took<00:02:55.120> that

00:02:55.260 --> 00:02:55.270 
along in NBA because he took that

00:02:55.270 --> 00:02:56.670 
along in NBA because he took that
approach<00:02:55.510> into<00:02:55.810> something<00:02:56.110> he<00:02:56.170> passed<00:02:56.380> on<00:02:56.560> to

00:02:56.670 --> 00:02:56.680
