at<00:00:32.340> home<00:00:32.520> and<00:00:32.759> it<00:00:33.300> turns<00:00:33.540> into<00:00:33.809> butter<00:00:34.140> very

00:00:34.580 --> 00:00:34.590 
at home and it turns into butter very

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:36.380 
at home and it turns into butter very
quickly<00:00:34.950> because<00:00:35.430> of<00:00:35.460> the<00:00:35.610> high<00:00:35.850> fat<00:00:36.149> content

00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:36.390 
quickly because of the high fat content

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:40.190 
quickly because of the high fat content
okay<00:00:37.410> this<00:00:37.980> recipe<00:00:38.430> has<00:00:38.640> 400<00:00:39.270> calories<00:00:39.750> and<00:00:39.960> is

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:40.200 
okay this recipe has 400 calories and is

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:42.920 
okay this recipe has 400 calories and is
a<00:00:40.230> four-to-one<00:00:40.710> ketogenic<00:00:41.520> ratio<00:00:41.969> the<00:00:42.690> first

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:42.930 
a four-to-one ketogenic ratio the first

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:45.950 
a four-to-one ketogenic ratio the first
thing<00:00:43.110> we<00:00:43.230> need<00:00:43.410> is<00:00:43.710> 45<00:00:44.460> grams<00:00:44.789> of<00:00:45.149> a<00:00:45.329> raw<00:00:45.539> egg

00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:45.960 
thing we need is 45 grams of a raw egg

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:49.100 
thing we need is 45 grams of a raw egg
one<00:00:46.559> large<00:00:46.890> egg<00:00:47.280> weighs<00:00:47.789> about<00:00:48.030> 50<00:00:48.570> grams<00:00:48.780> and

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:49.110 
one large egg weighs about 50 grams and

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:51.619 
one large egg weighs about 50 grams and
you<00:00:49.170> can<00:00:49.350> see<00:00:49.590> this<00:00:49.739> one<00:00:50.039> actually<00:00:50.700> weighs<00:00:50.850> 52

00:00:51.619 --> 00:00:51.629 
you can see this one actually weighs 52

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:55.850 
you can see this one actually weighs 52
grams<00:00:51.840> so<00:00:52.789> all<00:00:53.789> we<00:00:53.940> need<00:00:54.090> to<00:00:54.120> do<00:00:54.390> is<00:00:54.840> whisk<00:00:55.649> it

00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:55.860 
grams so all we need to do is whisk it

00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:59.330 
grams so all we need to do is whisk it
together<00:00:56.010> until<00:00:56.809> the<00:00:57.809> yolk<00:00:58.649> and<00:00:58.949> the<00:00:59.070> white

00:00:59.330 --> 00:00:59.340 
together until the yolk and the white

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:04.399 
together until the yolk and the white
part<00:00:59.789> are<00:01:00.090> combined<00:01:01.020> and<00:01:02.660> we<00:01:03.660> can<00:01:03.809> use<00:01:04.049> a

00:01:04.399 --> 00:01:04.409 
part are combined and we can use a

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:08.480 
part are combined and we can use a
syringe<00:01:05.159> to<00:01:05.519> remove<00:01:06.330> what<00:01:06.689> we<00:01:06.840> don't<00:01:07.049> need<00:01:07.490> so

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:08.490 
syringe to remove what we don't need so

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:11.210 
syringe to remove what we don't need so
we<00:01:08.610> need<00:01:08.760> 45<00:01:09.360> grams<00:01:09.890> that's<00:01:10.890> a<00:01:11.010> very

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:11.220 
we need 45 grams that's a very

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:13.100 
we need 45 grams that's a very
time-saving<00:01:11.939> step<00:01:12.240> because<00:01:12.630> eggs<00:01:12.869> are

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:13.110 
time-saving step because eggs are

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:14.750 
time-saving step because eggs are
stringy<00:01:13.500> and<00:01:13.619> they<00:01:13.830> actually<00:01:14.310> are<00:01:14.460> one<00:01:14.610> of<00:01:14.700> the

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:14.760 
stringy and they actually are one of the

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:16.730 
stringy and they actually are one of the
harder<00:01:15.060> things<00:01:15.090> to<00:01:15.570> weigh<00:01:15.720> okay<00:01:16.409> we<00:01:16.619> have

00:01:16.730 --> 00:01:16.740 
harder things to weigh okay we have

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:18.980 
harder things to weigh okay we have
exactly<00:01:17.159> 45<00:01:17.700> grams<00:01:18.000> the<00:01:18.360> next<00:01:18.630> thing<00:01:18.840> we<00:01:18.960> need

00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:18.990 
exactly 45 grams the next thing we need

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:24.440 
exactly 45 grams the next thing we need
is<00:01:19.380> 31<00:01:19.979> grams<00:01:20.310> of<00:01:20.729> macadamia<00:01:21.509> nut<00:01:21.720> butter<00:01:23.450> so

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:24.450 
is 31 grams of macadamia nut butter so

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:26.810 
is 31 grams of macadamia nut butter so
I'm<00:01:24.509> going<00:01:24.659> to<00:01:24.720> tear<00:01:24.990> the<00:01:25.170> scale<00:01:25.710> and<00:01:26.130> add<00:01:26.430> this

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:26.820 
I'm going to tear the scale and add this

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:30.499 
I'm going to tear the scale and add this
right<00:01:27.509> to<00:01:27.750> the<00:01:27.780> eggs<00:01:28.110> and<00:01:28.700> how<00:01:29.700> many<00:01:29.880> grams<00:01:30.270> am

00:01:30.499 --> 00:01:30.509 
right to the eggs and how many grams am

00:01:30.509 --> 00:01:37.010 
right to the eggs and how many grams am
I<00:01:30.600> going<00:01:30.869> to<00:01:31.020> add<00:01:31.170> 31<00:01:31.979> grams<00:01:34.280> perfect<00:01:35.900> then<00:01:36.900> we

00:01:37.010 --> 00:01:37.020 
I going to add 31 grams perfect then we

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:40.340 
I going to add 31 grams perfect then we
need<00:01:37.200> 13<00:01:37.680> grams<00:01:37.950> of<00:01:38.189> melted<00:01:38.759> coconut<00:01:39.030> oil<00:01:39.600> I'll

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:40.350 
need 13 grams of melted coconut oil I'll

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:43.130 
need 13 grams of melted coconut oil I'll
go<00:01:40.470> ahead<00:01:40.560> and<00:01:40.799> mix<00:01:40.920> it<00:01:41.130> together<00:01:41.220> and<00:01:41.990> we<00:01:42.990> can

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:43.140 
go ahead and mix it together and we can

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:47.760 
go ahead and mix it together and we can
add<00:01:43.350> a<00:01:43.380> couple<00:01:43.890> drops<00:01:44.220> of<00:01:44.520> liquid<00:01:45.210> stevia

00:01:47.760 --> 00:01:47.770 

00:01:47.770 --> 00:01:51.120 

okay<00:01:48.770> that<00:01:48.890> looks<00:01:48.979> perfect<00:01:49.490> ready<00:01:50.119> mm-hmm

00:01:51.120 --> 00:01:51.130 
okay that looks perfect ready mm-hmm

00:01:51.130 --> 00:01:55.719 
okay that looks perfect ready mm-hmm
and<00:01:52.570> but<00:01:53.570> I<00:01:53.600> especially<00:01:54.170> like<00:01:54.799> this<00:01:55.070> waffle

00:01:55.719 --> 00:01:55.729 
and but I especially like this waffle

00:01:55.729 --> 00:01:58.780 
and but I especially like this waffle
iron<00:01:55.970> because<00:01:56.630> it<00:01:56.659> has<00:01:57.399> smaller<00:01:58.399> sized

00:01:58.780 --> 00:01:58.790 
iron because it has smaller sized

00:01:58.790 --> 00:02:01.840 
iron because it has smaller sized
cavities<00:01:59.659> for<00:02:00.049> the<00:02:00.170> waffles<00:02:00.649> so<00:02:01.549> when<00:02:01.700> you're

00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:01.850 
cavities for the waffles so when you're

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:03.789 
cavities for the waffles so when you're
working<00:02:02.090> with<00:02:02.360> smaller<00:02:02.869> amounts<00:02:03.470> you<00:02:03.619> can

00:02:03.789 --> 00:02:03.799 
working with smaller amounts you can

00:02:03.799 --> 00:02:07.060 
working with smaller amounts you can
still<00:02:04.130> possibly<00:02:04.850> get<00:02:05.090> a<00:02:05.390> full<00:02:06.200> waffle<00:02:06.740> and<00:02:06.920> not

00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:07.070 
still possibly get a full waffle and not

00:02:07.070 --> 00:02:09.820 
still possibly get a full waffle and not
just<00:02:07.310> a<00:02:07.460> partial<00:02:07.759> waffle<00:02:08.569> and<00:02:09.319> these<00:02:09.530> are<00:02:09.649> such

00:02:09.820 --> 00:02:09.830 
just a partial waffle and these are such

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:12.660 
just a partial waffle and these are such
cute<00:02:10.160> shapes<00:02:10.600> especially<00:02:11.600> for<00:02:11.750> children

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:12.670 
cute shapes especially for children

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:15.160 
cute shapes especially for children
another<00:02:13.670> advantage<00:02:14.030> of<00:02:14.269> using<00:02:14.450> a<00:02:14.690> waffle<00:02:15.050> iron

00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:15.170 
another advantage of using a waffle iron
