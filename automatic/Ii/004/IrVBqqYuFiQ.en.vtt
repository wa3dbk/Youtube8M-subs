 answer a new company was engaged they had already realized that it was the 

00:00:51.610 --> 00:00:55.780
 wand of light what was watering them then I decided that it would begin 

00:00:55.780 --> 00:00:57.650
 to sell my devices 

00:00:57.650 --> 00:00:59.499
 no one would want 

00:00:59.499 --> 00:01:02.350
 the wand light was obsolete 

00:01:02.350 --> 00:01:05.640

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:21.450
 get some mini dollars per hour from the casinos 2 

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:28.020
 karma and whose current price nerd enderle the light wand for 30 thousand dollars 

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:31.400
 although the inspector had spent less than 10 dollars to manufacture

 your products then you want is a thousand dollars for that piece of metal turcios 

00:01:38.110 --> 00:01:38.749
 tomic 

00:01:38.749 --> 00:01:42.449
 I had never heard that a tool could sell for 30 thousand dollars 

00:01:42.449 --> 00:01:46.249
 but I knew that the Balearic Islands in fact knew that it was worth more than that but not 

00:01:46.249 --> 00:01:49.249
 I was going to be able to convince him of it 

00:01:50.140 --> 00:01:54.580
 Jesus a face and 20 is the only thing capable of beating electronics now 

00:01:54.580 --> 00:01:57.580
 I know he had everything 

00:02:14.749 --> 00:02:16.070

 We can win up to 10 thousand slowly 

00:02:24.849 --> 00:02:28.310
 I was surprised at how strong the amount of money that could be made was 

00:02:28.310 --> 00:02:29.669
 with her 

00:02:29.669 --> 00:02:32.809
 it was a very powerful tool 

00:02:32.809 --> 00:02:34.539
 wagner decides to buy 

00:02:34.539 --> 00:02:37.399

00:02:44.829 --> 00:02:47.579
 I would make a millionaire to have bought more 

00:02:47.579 --> 00:02:51.519

00:02:56.769 --> 00:03:00.709
 that nothing else already applied yesterday got him many sales in cativa 

00:03:00.709 --> 00:03:02.319
 take out frame 

00:03:02.319 --> 00:03:05.509
 the lack of light spread like a fire 

00:03:05.509 --> 00:03:08.419
 very soon a wand had spread so much that each molecule 

00:03:08.419 --> 00:03:10.600
 he had lost control over her 

00:03:10.600 --> 00:03:12.349
 the tool was copied 

00:03:12.349 --> 00:03:16.629
 the rumor spread and became common were all parts 

00:03:16.629 --> 00:03:19.749
 practically everyone had it 

00:03:19.749 --> 00:03:23.559
 crime strongly attacked the new casinos whose profits were seen 

00:03:23.559 --> 00:03:26.559
 reduced because of the common karma light wand 

00:03:27.739 --> 00:03:31.239
 meanwhile the flamer detective intensified his search for carnival 

00:03:31.239 --> 00:03:32.469
 with whom you want to play 

00:03:32.469 --> 00:03:35.469
 responsible for turning on the radio 

00:03:36.759 --> 00:03:39.349
 at the end of 1993 

00:03:39.349 --> 00:03:43.129
 it was atlantic city the detective flamer finds out that the carmona partner and 

00:03:43.129 --> 00:03:45.679
 whatever inspires me that city 

00:03:45.679 --> 00:03:48.539
 would go with the karzai's own as 

00:03:48.539 --> 00:03:52.609
 we learned that that day they would fly atlantic city we assigned a team of 

00:03:52.609 --> 00:03:55.699
 supervision so that he would wait for them and follow him to atlantic city 

00:03:56.739 --> 00:03:59.909
 flannery his team although to the template of which what almost never 

00:03:59.909 --> 00:04:00.719
 did 

00:04:00.719 --> 00:04:03.409
 carrying sentences 

00:04:03.409 --> 00:04:05.359
 we were watching them 

00:04:05.359 --> 00:04:08.359
 we follow him from one place to another 

00:04:09.089 --> 00:04:12.539
 we did not want to attend to them immediately but finally we locked them 

00:04:17.189 --> 00:04:19.729
 they had the device of the small internal 

00:04:19.729 --> 00:04:21.789
 what does my detective want? 

00:04:21.789 --> 00:04:23.599
 I have already said everything that yes 

00:04:23.599 --> 00:04:25.840
 we aspire to that marked the closure 

00:04:25.840 --> 00:04:28.029
 this only output 

00:04:28.029 --> 00:04:29.960
 we do not want you here 

00:04:29.960 --> 00:04:33.930
 we do not want academic that's what he told me we do not want you here we want to 

00:04:33.930 --> 00:04:35.210
 camacho 

00:04:35.210 --> 00:04:39.240
 It would be a bit my feelings you can choose between Sunday tours 

00:04:42.419 --> 00:04:45.770
 I was tom at the meeting this morning apparently they were meeting 

00:04:45.770 --> 00:04:48.620
 with other groups that were already in atlantic city 

00:04:48.620 --> 00:04:51.830
 all no sir he was not in the meeting 

00:04:51.830 --> 00:04:54.909
 I told him I had not seen Tony for six or seven months 

00:04:55.740 --> 00:04:59.610
 actually he had left my hotel room that morning to 

00:04:59.610 --> 00:05:01.849
 return to the tracks 

00:05:01.849 --> 00:05:05.059
 where he voted neither of this i 

00:05:05.059 --> 00:05:07.339
 long ago 

00:05:07.339 --> 00:05:10.729
 if we have never been so close to trapattoni 

00:05:12.069 --> 00:05:17.319
 had been in that meeting 30 minutes before possible but it had already been 

00:05:17.319 --> 00:05:19.629
 vanished 

00:05:19.629 --> 00:05:21.749
 Carmona went to win in front 

00:05:21.749 --> 00:05:25.819
 but now flamer had the euro wand this alerted the police of the 

00:05:25.819 --> 00:05:29.239
 casinos across the country that were alert in case they caught a lot 

00:05:29.239 --> 00:05:32.370
 All of them received a photograph of the 

00:05:32.370 --> 00:05:36.050
 and everyone was told that he was a public enemy number one 

00:05:36.050 --> 00:05:39.189
 the instructions were to be notified personally 

00:05:39.189 --> 00:05:42.139
 if someone saw it another peace 

00:05:42.139 --> 00:05:46.200
 the small 2000 and will continue to steal the casinos surrounded by agents 

00:05:46.199 --> 00:05:47.909
 of security 

00:05:47.909 --> 00:05:52.199
 you begin to feel that the staff is less confident they were watching more closely 

00:05:52.199 --> 00:05:55.719
 the machines because we had been fooling them for a long time sometimes 

00:05:55.719 --> 00:05:58.169
 they asked for identification and after plays 

00:05:58.169 --> 00:06:00.430
 at that moment I was dying of fear 

00:06:00.430 --> 00:06:03.719
 it was seen in his eyes that they suspected that we 

00:06:03.719 --> 00:06:07.580
 If I ever felt uncomfortable on the site we would leave immediately 

00:06:07.580 --> 00:06:11.740
 the fact that he was able to enter large casinos full of cameras 

00:06:11.740 --> 00:06:16.119
 surveillance of the place not without any effort says a lot about it 

00:06:16.119 --> 00:06:19.009
 it was enough to remain in the shade 

00:06:19.009 --> 00:06:22.789
 by the end of the 90s the neighbors and they are even updating their machines 

00:06:22.789 --> 00:06:25.789
 Slots to protect yourself from the lack of carnival light 

00:06:26.639 --> 00:06:31.129
 they invented a new system in which the optical sensor was not used it was called 

00:06:31.129 --> 00:06:34.189
 romantic device at home 

00:06:34.189 --> 00:06:36.789
 but that there are no conditions and as a body of advantage 

00:06:36.789 --> 00:06:39.839
 was developing a revolutionary new tool that would be 

00:06:39.839 --> 00:06:40.619
 capable of everything 

00:06:40.619 --> 00:06:42.569
 millions of dollars to casinos 

00:06:42.569 --> 00:06:45.059
 a tool that could cause you to fall 

00:06:45.059 --> 00:06:45.739
 the pull of sales
