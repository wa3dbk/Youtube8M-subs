00:00:21.679 --> 00:00:21.689 
right with the chain alignment that's I

00:00:21.689 --> 00:00:23.840 
right with the chain alignment that's I
can't<00:00:21.960> please<00:00:22.230> cut<00:00:22.590> away<00:00:22.859> there<00:00:23.100> it<00:00:23.400> gives<00:00:23.609> me

can't please cut away there it gives me
room<00:00:24.060> now<00:00:24.769> to<00:00:25.769> get<00:00:26.250> the<00:00:27.439> chain<00:00:28.439> pieces<00:00:28.890> in<00:00:29.099> and

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:29.730 
room now to get the chain pieces in and

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:32.749 
room now to get the chain pieces in and
the<00:00:30.449> matchless<00:00:30.869> sprocket<00:00:31.470> see<00:00:31.859> it<00:00:32.520> would<00:00:32.669> have

00:00:32.749 --> 00:00:32.759 
the matchless sprocket see it would have

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:37.670 
the matchless sprocket see it would have
been<00:00:32.880> over<00:00:33.030> there<00:00:33.829> chain<00:00:34.829> wheel<00:00:35.280> Alain<00:00:36.680> so

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:37.680 
been over there chain wheel Alain so

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:40.340 
been over there chain wheel Alain so
we're<00:00:38.250> cooking<00:00:38.430> with<00:00:38.640> gas<00:00:38.790> no<00:00:39.270> that's<00:00:39.840> in<00:00:40.110> line

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:40.350 
we're cooking with gas no that's in line

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:44.930 
we're cooking with gas no that's in line
I've<00:00:41.280> also<00:00:41.780> modified<00:00:43.399> I've<00:00:44.399> used<00:00:44.610> a<00:00:44.760> long

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:44.940 
I've also modified I've used a long

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:47.529 
I've also modified I've used a long
through<00:00:45.270> bolt<00:00:45.510> here<00:00:45.899> for<00:00:46.140> the<00:00:46.260> rear<00:00:46.379> brake<00:00:46.770> and

00:00:47.529 --> 00:00:47.539 
through bolt here for the rear brake and

00:00:47.539 --> 00:00:53.330 
through bolt here for the rear brake and
a<00:00:48.539> boost<00:00:48.780> art<00:00:49.110> simply<00:00:49.680> because<00:00:51.559> 37<00:00:52.559> 3<00:00:52.890> the

00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:53.340 
a boost art simply because 37 3 the

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:55.540 
a boost art simply because 37 3 the
break<00:00:53.579> came<00:00:53.910> over<00:00:54.059> the<00:00:54.300> primary<00:00:54.780> chain<00:00:55.020> case

00:00:55.540 --> 00:00:55.550 
break came over the primary chain case

00:00:55.550 --> 00:00:59.090 
break came over the primary chain case
so<00:00:56.550> I'm<00:00:57.360> doing<00:00:57.600> this<00:00:57.840> idea<00:00:58.379> and<00:00:58.649> it'll<00:00:58.859> still

00:00:59.090 --> 00:00:59.100 
so I'm doing this idea and it'll still

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:03.560 
so I'm doing this idea and it'll still
work<00:01:00.320> there's<00:01:01.320> no<00:01:01.440> great<00:01:02.059> straight<00:01:03.059> and<00:01:03.480> I'll

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:03.570 
work there's no great straight and I'll

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:07.399 
work there's no great straight and I'll
stop<00:01:04.110> there<00:01:04.640> because<00:01:05.640> it's<00:01:05.909> all<00:01:06.060> I<00:01:06.090> can<00:01:06.330> do<00:01:06.570> I'd

00:01:07.399 --> 00:01:07.409 
stop there because it's all I can do I'd

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:09.380 
stop there because it's all I can do I'd
have<00:01:07.590> to<00:01:07.770> weld<00:01:07.979> a<00:01:08.159> boss<00:01:08.369> in<00:01:08.670> the<00:01:08.700> frame<00:01:09.030> and<00:01:09.299> I'm

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:09.390 
have to weld a boss in the frame and I'm

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:11.990 
have to weld a boss in the frame and I'm
not<00:01:09.600> wanting<00:01:09.869> to<00:01:09.930> do<00:01:10.110> that<00:01:10.320> and<00:01:11.010> when<00:01:11.220> they<00:01:11.400> ejs

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:12.000 
not wanting to do that and when they ejs

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:13.250 
not wanting to do that and when they ejs
was<00:01:12.330> mucking<00:01:12.570> about

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:13.260 
was mucking about

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:17.810 
was mucking about
I<00:01:13.290> mean<00:01:14.450> perspex<00:01:15.450> rocker<00:01:16.020> box<00:01:16.380> covers<00:01:16.920> and<00:01:17.280> I

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:17.820 
I mean perspex rocker box covers and I

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:21.770 
I mean perspex rocker box covers and I
could<00:01:18.030> then<00:01:18.180> study<00:01:19.070> ie<00:01:20.180> what<00:01:21.180> was<00:01:21.330> happening

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:21.780 
could then study ie what was happening

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:23.600 
could then study ie what was happening
with<00:01:21.900> the<00:01:21.990> oil<00:01:22.170> circulation<00:01:22.530> and<00:01:23.159> what<00:01:23.430> was

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:23.610 
with the oil circulation and what was

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:25.969 
with the oil circulation and what was
happening<00:01:24.000> see<00:01:24.439> perfect<00:01:25.439> you<00:01:25.619> can<00:01:25.799> see

00:01:25.969 --> 00:01:25.979 
happening see perfect you can see

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:29.179 
happening see perfect you can see
perfectly<00:01:26.640> in<00:01:27.299> there<00:01:27.630> what<00:01:28.619> was<00:01:28.770> happening

00:01:29.179 --> 00:01:29.189 
perfectly in there what was happening

00:01:29.189 --> 00:01:31.819 
perfectly in there what was happening
battalion<00:01:29.729> idea<00:01:30.270> and<00:01:30.600> then<00:01:31.259> I<00:01:31.290> could<00:01:31.560> see

00:01:31.819 --> 00:01:31.829 
battalion idea and then I could see

00:01:31.829 --> 00:01:37.510 
battalion idea and then I could see
where<00:01:32.369> to<00:01:32.610> grind<00:01:32.850> and<00:01:33.240> what<00:01:33.750> to<00:01:33.960> do

as<00:02:02.969> I'm<00:02:03.149> pushing<00:02:03.360> the<00:02:03.630> bottle<00:02:04.020> on<00:02:04.140> they<00:02:05.070> just

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:05.100 
as I'm pushing the bottle on they just

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:10.249 
as I'm pushing the bottle on they just
go<00:02:05.520> down<00:02:05.549> well<00:02:06.180> it<00:02:06.509> works<00:02:06.810> everything<00:02:09.259> so

00:02:10.249 --> 00:02:10.259 
go down well it works everything so

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:12.140 
go down well it works everything so
we'll<00:02:10.379> do<00:02:10.560> that<00:02:10.590> later<00:02:10.800> on<00:02:11.099> I'll<00:02:11.700> put

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:12.150 
we'll do that later on I'll put

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:14.390 
we'll do that later on I'll put
