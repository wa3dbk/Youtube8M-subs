00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:13.420
 also a part of the team because of us 

00:00:09.940 --> 00:00:15.490
 Of course, that's what he wants 

00:00:13.420 --> 00:00:17.260
 he feels comfortable here like us 

00:00:15.490 --> 00:00:20.470
 Of course, he also wanted to win for him 

00:00:17.260 --> 00:00:21.880
 but first and foremost we wanted for the 

00:00:20.470 --> 00:00:24.220
 team wins for us for us 

00:00:21.880 --> 00:00:25.950
 help we see the bus as a part 

00:00:24.220 --> 00:00:30.460
 from that 

00:00:25.950 --> 00:00:33.190
 and yes we won we can we 

00:00:30.460 --> 00:00:34.630
 still have air up and so on 

00:00:33.190 --> 00:00:36.580
 We believe in the next games 

00:00:34.630 --> 00:00:38.530
 it could also have gone 6 4 so 

00:00:36.580 --> 00:00:40.570
 I say do as has also not 

00:00:38.530 --> 00:00:42.340
 but complaining for me now is there 

00:00:40.570 --> 00:00:45.880
 Of course the most important thing is to zero 

00:00:42.340 --> 00:00:48.820
 plays and that to me yesterday for the second 

00:00:45.880 --> 00:00:50.560
 succeeded after cottbus and yes me 

00:00:48.820 --> 00:00:53.290
 I was really looking forward to everyone 

00:00:50.560 --> 00:00:55.720
 case is problem that we we already 

00:00:53.290 --> 00:00:58.120
 as a team relatively much allowed 

00:00:55.720 --> 00:01:00.940
 have and that we were up yesterday 

00:00:58.120 --> 00:01:03.280
 have left our goalkeeper 

00:01:00.940 --> 00:01:05.409
 course also belongs to the defensive and 

00:01:03.280 --> 00:01:07.210
 He has his job incredibly well 

00:01:05.409 --> 00:01:09.640
 made and helped us 

00:01:07.210 --> 00:01:15.940
 Of course, simpsons are happy 

00:01:09.640 --> 00:01:17.320
 that you played to zero but as 

00:01:15.940 --> 00:01:18.370
 Team we can we can do better 

00:01:17.320 --> 00:01:20.979
 defend we were 

00:01:18.370 --> 00:01:23.740
 we were there all the way to the open and the 

00:01:20.979 --> 00:01:25.840
 jens really has us in one too 

00:01:23.740 --> 00:01:29.920
 or other scene must save properly 

00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:32.470
 yes it was nice, of course 

00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:33.369
 after the 1 0 had so what is nicer 

00:01:32.470 --> 00:01:37.570
 for me was nice 

00:01:33.369 --> 00:01:39.520
 after the single parades right after the 

00:01:37.570 --> 00:01:40.390
 single we did was me 

00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:43.570
 right in it 

00:01:40.390 --> 00:01:46.390
 and yes it is very much for then 

00:01:43.570 --> 00:01:47.520
 I have been able to do this 100 times 

00:01:46.390 --> 00:01:49.750
 distinguish 

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:51.280
 but I guess that we as 

00:01:49.750 --> 00:01:53.500
 still defended the team well 

00:01:51.280 --> 00:01:54.420
 You can not balance that 

00:01:53.500 --> 00:01:57.100
 always defend 

00:01:54.420 --> 00:02:00.250
 but for me it was already nice day 

00:01:57.100 --> 00:02:01.400
 So, now was not the hardest 

00:02:00.250 --> 00:02:03.320
 gate 

00:02:01.400 --> 00:02:05.300
 I was lucky that on 

00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:09.410
 right place at the right time too 

00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:11.450
 stand and then it was just it only went 

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:15.170
 therefore to get the ball over the line 

00:02:11.450 --> 00:02:17.060
 And every goal is beautiful 

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:19.190
 defender vollmann does not make it so 

00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:22.160
 many and that's why I'm happy too 

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:23.650
 about a bit over happy 

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:26.240
 is happy 

00:02:23.650 --> 00:02:29.780
 we have four more games in the season 

00:02:26.240 --> 00:02:33.310
 not over and now, of course, is good 

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:35.900
 from when we do only that but we want 

00:02:33.310 --> 00:02:36.980
 maybe only in small with an eye 

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:38.840
 maybe wink and another one 

00:02:36.980 --> 00:02:40.250
 bit up but I think advertise 

00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:41.630
 has played a solid season and 

00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:41.990
 We also want to finish well now 

00:02:41.630 --> 00:02:44.560
 bring 

00:02:41.990 --> 00:02:46.459
 We are happy that we are victorious 

00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:48.680
 have gone from the place 

00:02:46.459 --> 00:02:51.709
 a big thank-you, of course, too 

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:54.010
 jens the super kept not so 

00:02:51.709 --> 00:02:54.010
 bad
