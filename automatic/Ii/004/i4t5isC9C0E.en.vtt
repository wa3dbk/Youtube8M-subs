00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
 1 

00:00:02.760 --> 00:00:06.880
 it's a killer is enough to mathieu 

00:00:05.080 --> 00:00:07.750
 valbuena the worst because that I find 

00:00:06.880 --> 00:00:09.790
 unacceptable 

00:00:07.750 --> 00:00:11.410
 all people whistle a boy like 

00:00:09.790 --> 00:00:12.970
 matthias von arx zoning marseille 

00:00:11.410 --> 00:00:14.020
 the guy who wore this jersey when 

00:00:12.970 --> 00:00:16.779
 they wear it if there is really a 

00:00:14.020 --> 00:00:17.769
 which one could possibly not 

00:00:16.779 --> 00:00:19.419
 make him blame mathieu 

00:00:17.769 --> 00:00:21.730
 valbuena then the guys who go to the park 

00:00:19.419 --> 00:00:22.779
 there we will be able to the team of France and 

00:00:21.730 --> 00:00:24.609
 for him to know it's blue jersey of 

00:00:22.779 --> 00:00:26.769
 the swiss team bah yes would you have 

00:00:24.609 --> 00:00:28.749
 everything if I recommend it 

00:00:26.769 --> 00:00:32.110
 I would not do the public at all 

00:00:28.749 --> 00:00:34.420
 fekki what gives them an agent name 

00:00:32.110 --> 00:00:36.460
 expressed at gibert lowering the euro 

00:00:34.420 --> 00:00:38.650
 was worth that baby doc had left the 

00:00:36.460 --> 00:00:40.270
 progress on the ground of magnifying 

00:00:38.650 --> 00:00:42.160
 because mathieu valbuena this is 

00:00:40.270 --> 00:00:43.630
 bad game although a little reaction 

00:00:42.160 --> 00:00:45.520
 but when the guy gets back on the 

00:00:43.630 --> 00:00:47.470
 field and at the first balloon it is 

00:00:45.520 --> 00:00:49.350
 type I find it inadmissible 

00:00:47.470 --> 00:00:53.320
 he avoided is called the freedom of the big 

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:55.450
 never his week freedom of action 

00:00:53.320 --> 00:00:57.280
 legs yesterday for two to two to 

00:00:55.450 --> 00:00:58.420
 tail to better solve and its flora 

00:00:57.280 --> 00:01:00.790
 c and really this is very serious 

00:00:58.420 --> 00:01:02.680
 berdeil has however it is very serious the 

00:01:00.790 --> 00:01:04.600
 first is that before mass and 

00:01:02.680 --> 00:01:08.890
 why not what you give you 

00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:09.400
 a white hand to a crowd that has to 

00:01:08.890 --> 00:01:12.159
 hold 

00:01:09.400 --> 00:01:14.230
 that's it's a basic principle it's 

00:01:12.159 --> 00:01:16.210
 to say we do not have all the rights because 

00:01:14.230 --> 00:01:18.880
 that between the parliament the crimes 

00:01:16.210 --> 00:01:20.650
 chedjou challenge of tension - and we 

00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:23.800
 is all to denounce a given moment of 

00:01:20.650 --> 00:01:25.780
 overflowing spectators into 

00:01:23.800 --> 00:01:27.880
 such and such place and if indeed 

00:01:25.780 --> 00:01:28.240
 you tell people you have all the 

00:01:27.880 --> 00:01:30.430
 rights 

00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:33.850
 at that moment it is again 

00:01:30.430 --> 00:01:36.190
 open a door to things that's 

00:01:33.850 --> 00:01:38.170
 an overflow a second second skin 

00:01:36.190 --> 00:01:39.820
 point because it's a duty I know 

00:01:38.170 --> 00:01:42.640
 not why men are the reasons 

00:01:39.820 --> 00:01:44.020
 unless unless you are there 

00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:45.790
 think that many people have the 

00:01:44.020 --> 00:01:47.860
 same look at the sport why the 

00:01:45.790 --> 00:01:49.990
 sports public will be exempt from rules 

00:01:47.860 --> 00:01:52.210
 as bones as in the theater as in 

00:01:49.990 --> 00:01:53.110
 the opera as in the cinema where you did not 

00:01:52.210 --> 00:01:55.270
 all the rights 

00:01:53.110 --> 00:01:57.310
 because you sit there is so much me 

00:01:55.270 --> 00:02:00.159
 I reviewed the adr formulated the wish 

00:01:57.310 --> 00:02:03.060
 the opera last rules to respect his 

00:02:00.159 --> 00:02:05.350
 dreams she actually has a chance I 

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:06.760
 not see what you're gonna do formulated 

00:02:05.350 --> 00:02:08.080
 the moment you had not all the 

00:02:06.760 --> 00:02:09.240
 rights and you do not have the right to run 

00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:10.670
 people spend their time eating 

00:02:09.240 --> 00:02:11.540
 reworded 

00:02:10.670 --> 00:02:13.030
 I do not speak obviously of 

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:16.250
 overflowing type racist chants 

00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:17.660
 fight and company but at the end of a 

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:19.310
 play if you feel that the 

00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:21.410
 play was no need to 

00:02:19.310 --> 00:02:24.470
 express it as in the end he listened to a 

00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:26.060
 day why not why he'll have to 

00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:27.709
 do full of hunger because the 

00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:29.630
 stability in the France team is going 

00:02:27.709 --> 00:02:31.430
 aim are whistles against 

00:02:29.630 --> 00:02:32.720
 Parisian players let it take 

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:36.800
 that the team of France is worth to go there 

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:38.540
 for valbuena but it's done by codes 

00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:41.630
 who serves the show is interesting 

00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:43.250
 but she confesses serge you do you 

00:02:41.630 --> 00:02:43.940
 were I lost you are crazy there was beautiful 

00:02:43.250 --> 00:02:46.220
 age to fight 

00:02:43.940 --> 00:02:48.290
 so it's a code to support them and 

00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:49.730
 come back late ian scott to denounce not 

00:02:48.290 --> 00:02:52.580
 lost of course not obviously if you want 

00:02:49.730 --> 00:02:55.160
 only in the life behind these 

00:02:52.580 --> 00:02:56.360
 two gilbert I can not be 

00:02:55.160 --> 00:02:57.319
 agree with you I understand what you 

00:02:56.360 --> 00:02:58.970
 mean I can not agree with 

00:02:57.319 --> 00:03:00.500
 you but unfortunately not by 

00:02:58.970 --> 00:03:01.370
 three hours 8:00 this sector 

00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:02.630
 will not change 

00:03:01.370 --> 00:03:04.700
 whatever happens it will not change 

00:03:02.630 --> 00:03:07.100
 abarth whistle the Parisian players to 

00:03:04.700 --> 00:03:08.750
 paris has especially at the park also that the 

00:03:07.100 --> 00:03:10.730
 Marseille players it's always been 

00:03:08.750 --> 00:03:11.780
 like that if I want to tell him you you 

00:03:10.730 --> 00:03:20.600
 can make debates such as you 

00:03:11.780 --> 00:03:21.799
 do you have the legates exactions that makes 

00:03:20.600 --> 00:03:24.049
 change the world we can 

00:03:21.799 --> 00:03:25.730
 regions and who have an attitude there ben 

00:03:24.049 --> 00:03:29.690
 yes yes yes it holds me the wood of course 

00:03:25.730 --> 00:03:31.640
 that we parents then if you are a player 

00:03:29.690 --> 00:03:33.470
 which door we can decide 

00:03:31.640 --> 00:03:35.000
 I found that there is one can quote 

00:03:33.470 --> 00:03:41.180
 benzema side enters the field on 

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:42.950
 can not do what we can we would like the 

00:03:41.180 --> 00:03:45.530
 embarrassment is on hold bought this ticket 

00:03:42.950 --> 00:03:46.459
 something to know report by 

00:03:45.530 --> 00:03:48.530
 report to benzema 

00:03:46.459 --> 00:03:50.299
 it's a subject that's pretty much all 

00:03:48.530 --> 00:03:52.820
 weekends we talk about it we talk about it again 

00:03:50.299 --> 00:03:53.959
 his attitude his envy his commitment you 

00:03:52.820 --> 00:03:55.489
 see what I mean my boys 

00:03:53.959 --> 00:03:58.190
 like valbuena return to the field 

00:03:55.489 --> 00:03:58.790
 so which law and what are 

00:03:58.190 --> 00:04:01.069
 the reasons 

00:03:58.790 --> 00:04:04.579
 give me terry and you know her the 

00:04:01.069 --> 00:04:09.170
 reason the minister I'm always with 

00:04:04.579 --> 00:04:11.209
 me it must I am there all the 

00:04:09.170 --> 00:04:12.310
 domains does not say why you 're not going 

00:04:11.209 --> 00:04:14.230
 listened I was bitter 

00:04:12.310 --> 00:04:18.669
 all alone metal in his assaults 

00:04:14.230 --> 00:04:20.380
 it's also because it happened to me 

00:04:18.669 --> 00:04:21.639
 in a stadium to see people who 

00:04:20.380 --> 00:04:23.860
 took up the cause for such 

00:04:21.639 --> 00:04:25.720
 person and people next to others 

00:04:23.860 --> 00:04:27.250
 supporters react and that is to say 

00:04:25.720 --> 00:04:29.200
 that he was not happy with his steps 

00:04:27.250 --> 00:04:32.400
 harmful but that's what I did 

00:04:29.200 --> 00:04:32.400
 fact that is what I am
