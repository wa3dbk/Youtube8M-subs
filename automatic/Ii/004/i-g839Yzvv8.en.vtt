00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.958
What's up beautiful people? It
is your homegirl Ms. Shameless,

00:00:01.958 --> 00:00:03.083
all up in your building.

00:00:03.083 --> 00:00:09.792
And this video is why I can't
get a man. [pretends to cry]

00:00:09.792 --> 00:00:11.250
I'm going to break it down,

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:14.333
five reasons/excuses
why I can't get it.

00:00:14.333 --> 00:00:15.667
I just can't get it.

00:00:15.667 --> 00:00:18.542
The first reason/excuse is
I don't get out like that.

00:00:18.542 --> 00:00:21.167
I would much rather be on
my couch on a Friday night

00:00:21.167 --> 00:00:25.167
catching up on HBO, Netflix,
Hulu, my Game of Thrones

00:00:25.167 --> 00:00:27.292
than out on the town.

00:00:27.292 --> 00:00:31.000
Excuse number two, when I
do go out I'm usually caught

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:34.500
in my post-workout martial arts
gear, which is so not cute.

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:36.417
And of course, who
happens to be by the pool?

00:00:36.417 --> 00:00:39.083
The hot neighbor, the
hot neighbor is by the pool.

00:00:39.083 --> 00:00:43.083
â™ª

00:00:47.542 --> 00:00:52.958
Is just getting his life, body
on fleek, me looking like what.

00:00:52.958 --> 00:00:54.833
She did not try it.

00:00:54.833 --> 00:00:57.792
Walk of shame, why
does this happen to me?

00:00:57.792 --> 00:01:01.083
Oh! Thumbs-up if this
has ever happened to you.

00:01:01.083 --> 00:01:03.333
And when I finally do
dress-up to paint the town

00:01:03.333 --> 00:01:05.083
this ish happens to me.

00:01:05.083 --> 00:01:06.750
Can I borrow some sugar?

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:09.375
[Maya on the phone]: Getting changed, I am
beating this face so good

00:01:09.375 --> 00:01:10.833
[Maya on the phone] you won't even recognize it.

00:01:10.833 --> 00:01:13.625
[knock] "Hold on,
someone is at the door."

00:01:14.833 --> 00:01:16.708
MAYA: Hi, can I help you?

00:01:16.708 --> 00:01:20.125
Whoa, nope.

00:01:20.125 --> 00:01:23.333
MAYA: Trick you tried it,
you tried it so good and no.

00:01:23.333 --> 00:01:24.458
Reason number three,

00:01:24.458 --> 00:01:28.167
my petite self happens
to intimidate grown men.

00:01:28.167 --> 00:01:29.375
[pretends to cry]

00:01:29.375 --> 00:01:31.167
Shameless Maya, the girl
I've been telling you about.

00:01:31.167 --> 00:01:33.833
Excuse me, do you know what they
changed the garage code to?

00:01:33.833 --> 00:01:38.542
Uh, nah, nah sorry.

00:01:38.542 --> 00:01:41.083
Bro, I fucked it up.

00:01:41.083 --> 00:01:47.583
My fourth reason,
when a guy hits on me I
either A, miss it completely.

00:01:47.583 --> 00:01:49.500
Hey you sending
something to somebody special?

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:51.708
No I'm just sending mail.

00:01:51.708 --> 00:01:55.583
Oh OK, cool, you should
check my package out sometime.

00:01:55.583 --> 00:01:59.583
Oh, what do you use
for shipping? Do you
use UPS, Fed-Ex, or USPS?

00:01:59.583 --> 00:02:00.917
Because sometimes I
don't know which one to use

00:02:00.917 --> 00:02:02.125
and I want to send something
that's really important --

00:02:02.125 --> 00:02:03.250
DALLAS: Never mind, it's cool.

00:02:03.250 --> 00:02:04.833
MAYA: I don't want it to get
like lost in the mail,

00:02:04.833 --> 00:02:06.333
and I've always
had problems before.

00:02:06.333 --> 00:02:09.917
So sometimes I think now I --

00:02:09.917 --> 00:02:12.125
Or B, I do not
know how to flirt back,

00:02:12.125 --> 00:02:13.875
especially with a
guy that I don't know.

00:02:13.875 --> 00:02:15.708
Like if I know you,
you and me are cool

00:02:15.708 --> 00:02:18.375
then that's OK, I
know how to flirt.

00:02:18.375 --> 00:02:22.667
But if I don't know you
I'm just like ah-ah-o-ah-ugh.

00:02:22.667 --> 00:02:24.917
- That's a cute dog.
- Oh thanks.

00:02:24.917 --> 00:02:26.250
What kind is she?

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:27.708
Uh, she's a Jack
Russell Chihuahua

00:02:27.708 --> 00:02:29.750
- Oh yeah? She's cute. 
- Thanks.

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:32.375
Kind of like her momma.

00:02:34.750 --> 00:02:36.250
And finally reason number five,

00:02:36.250 --> 00:02:39.208
I can be picky and
there are slim pickings.

00:02:39.208 --> 00:02:42.125
How did your date go?
Spill the tea.

00:02:42.125 --> 00:02:44.292
Eh, it was so weird.
It was so weird girl.

00:02:44.292 --> 00:02:47.125
Well whatever, like wasn't your
physiotherapist like really cute

00:02:47.125 --> 00:02:48.875
and like giving
you a special massage?

00:02:48.875 --> 00:02:51.667
Yeah, but girl he's so young,

00:02:51.667 --> 00:02:53.500
like why do they
got to be so young?

00:02:53.500 --> 00:02:55.917
What about the guy at
your martial arts class?

00:02:55.917 --> 00:02:59.833
No. [laughs] Body
on fleek, too old.

00:02:59.833 --> 00:03:03.333
OK, didn't you say
that like some hot guy
moved into your building?

00:03:03.333 --> 00:03:07.125
He's cute, but he's so
pretty, like he's too cute.

00:03:07.125 --> 00:03:08.250
Too cute?

00:03:08.250 --> 00:03:11.583
Standing beside him I feel like
a Gremlin, no, not happening.

00:03:11.583 --> 00:03:16.000
Too cute. Hello? Shannon? Hello?

00:03:17.958 --> 00:03:22.708
So, those are my
five reasons/excuses
why I can't get a man.

00:03:22.708 --> 00:03:24.542

know what yours are.

you, and stay true, boo.

00:03:38.833 --> 00:03:41.875

shameless, be shameless.
