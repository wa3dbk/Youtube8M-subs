there's<00:01:09.780> a<00:01:09.990> bunch<00:01:10.380> of<00:01:10.590> code<00:01:10.860> now<00:01:11.369> the<00:01:12.119> great

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:12.360 
there's a bunch of code now the great

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:14.060 
there's a bunch of code now the great
thing<00:01:12.600> about<00:01:12.630> embed<00:01:13.260> code<00:01:13.530> is<00:01:13.650> that<00:01:13.799> you<00:01:13.920> don't

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:14.070 
thing about embed code is that you don't

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:15.830 
thing about embed code is that you don't
have<00:01:14.189> to<00:01:14.340> understand<00:01:14.850> what<00:01:15.000> this<00:01:15.150> code<00:01:15.420> means

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:15.840 
have to understand what this code means

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:19.130 
have to understand what this code means
to<00:01:16.560> place<00:01:16.770> it<00:01:16.950> into<00:01:17.070> your<00:01:17.280> course<00:01:17.990> once<00:01:18.990> you

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:19.140 
to place it into your course once you

on<00:01:46.170> YouTube<00:01:46.759> so<00:01:47.759> here's<00:01:47.939> a<00:01:48.000> YouTube<00:01:48.240> video

00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:49.560 
on YouTube so here's a YouTube video

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:53.569 
on YouTube so here's a YouTube video
to<00:01:50.990> bond<00:01:51.990> embed<00:01:52.409> code<00:01:52.710> for<00:01:52.950> a<00:01:53.009> YouTube<00:01:53.430> video

embed now YouTube videos or a little bit

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:06.020 
embed now YouTube videos or a little bit
unique<00:02:02.100> and<00:02:02.610> that<00:02:03.140> that<00:02:04.140> code<00:02:04.470> has<00:02:05.030> different

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:06.030 
unique and that that code has different

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:08.059 
unique and that that code has different
options<00:02:06.179> along<00:02:07.020> with<00:02:07.229> it<00:02:07.409> so<00:02:07.439> if<00:02:07.740> you<00:02:07.860> look

when the video has finished playing and

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:25.370

00:02:25.380 --> 00:02:28.130

00:02:28.130 --> 00:02:28.140 
because those videos show ads and things

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:29.720 
because those videos show ads and things
like<00:02:28.290> that<00:02:28.500> your<00:02:28.650> students<00:02:29.040> students<00:02:29.640> are
