00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:27.930 
standing outside getting wet well I

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:30.470 
standing outside getting wet well I
decided<00:00:28.650> to<00:00:29.160> plan<00:00:29.400> in<00:00:29.580> advance<00:00:29.670> for<00:00:30.150> that

00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:30.480 
decided to plan in advance for that

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:33.380 
decided to plan in advance for that
situation<00:00:30.750> and<00:00:31.500> there<00:00:32.460> was<00:00:32.579> a<00:00:32.610> few<00:00:32.880> ideas<00:00:33.000> I

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:33.390 
situation and there was a few ideas I

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:36.650 
situation and there was a few ideas I
came<00:00:33.630> up<00:00:33.780> with<00:00:33.960> the<00:00:34.079> help<00:00:34.290> that<00:00:34.559> one<00:00:34.860> I<00:00:35.660> camped

00:00:36.650 --> 00:00:36.660 
came up with the help that one I camped

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:39.680 
came up with the help that one I camped
in<00:00:36.750> a<00:00:36.840> hammock<00:00:37.079> under<00:00:37.860> a<00:00:38.129> tarp<00:00:38.660> instead<00:00:39.660> of

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:39.690 
in a hammock under a tarp instead of

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:43.700 
in a hammock under a tarp instead of
camping<00:00:40.530> in<00:00:40.860> a<00:00:41.070> backpacking<00:00:41.520> tent<00:00:41.910> so<00:00:42.750> my<00:00:43.350> tarp

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:43.710 
camping in a backpacking tent so my tarp

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:45.200 
camping in a backpacking tent so my tarp
was<00:00:43.920> big<00:00:44.129> enough<00:00:44.160> that<00:00:44.370> we<00:00:44.610> can<00:00:44.760> all<00:00:44.879> hang<00:00:45.059> out

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:45.210 
was big enough that we can all hang out

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:47.950 
was big enough that we can all hang out
under<00:00:45.629> it<00:00:45.750> and<00:00:45.989> the<00:00:46.860> second<00:00:47.219> thing<00:00:47.250> was<00:00:47.579> I

00:00:47.950 --> 00:00:47.960 
under it and the second thing was I

00:00:47.960 --> 00:00:52.430 
under it and the second thing was I
wanted<00:00:48.960> to<00:00:49.050> be<00:00:49.200> able<00:00:49.289> to<00:00:49.559> have<00:00:49.829> a<00:00:49.890> fire<00:00:50.190> and<00:00:51.440> an

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:52.440 
wanted to be able to have a fire and an

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:54.080 
wanted to be able to have a fire and an
idea<00:00:52.829> popped<00:00:53.100> into<00:00:53.340> my<00:00:53.489> head<00:00:53.520> for<00:00:54.000> an

00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:54.090 
idea popped into my head for an

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:56.900 
idea popped into my head for an
emergency<00:00:54.329> fire<00:00:54.930> starter<00:00:55.469> because<00:00:56.010> I<00:00:56.579> feel

00:00:56.900 --> 00:00:56.910 
emergency fire starter because I feel

00:00:56.910 --> 00:00:59.869 
emergency fire starter because I feel
like<00:00:57.230> most<00:00:58.230> of<00:00:58.500> the<00:00:58.559> emergency<00:00:59.160> fire<00:00:59.370> starters

00:00:59.869 --> 00:00:59.879 
like most of the emergency fire starters

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:03.229 
like most of the emergency fire starters
that<00:01:00.030> everybody<00:01:00.420> makes<00:01:00.629> videos<00:01:01.020> about<00:01:02.239> there

00:01:03.229 --> 00:01:03.239 
that everybody makes videos about there

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:05.329 
that everybody makes videos about there
are<00:01:03.510> a<00:01:03.539> good<00:01:04.080> fire<00:01:04.439> starter<00:01:04.949> for<00:01:05.159> most

00:01:05.329 --> 00:01:05.339 
are a good fire starter for most

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:07.730 
are a good fire starter for most
scenarios<00:01:05.820> but<00:01:06.510> if<00:01:06.630> things<00:01:06.810> are<00:01:07.080> soaking<00:01:07.380> wet

00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:07.740 
scenarios but if things are soaking wet

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:09.800 
scenarios but if things are soaking wet
or<00:01:08.010> if<00:01:08.220> you're<00:01:08.369> going<00:01:08.610> type<00:01:08.909> of<00:01:09.090> thermacore<00:01:09.540> if

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:09.810 
or if you're going type of thermacore if

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:11.630 
or if you're going type of thermacore if
you're<00:01:09.960> losing<00:01:10.380> feeling<00:01:10.950> in<00:01:11.040> your<00:01:11.189> fingers

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:11.640 
you're losing feeling in your fingers

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:13.850 
you're losing feeling in your fingers
they're<00:01:12.570> going<00:01:12.659> to<00:01:12.720> be<00:01:12.840> really<00:01:13.229> difficult<00:01:13.439> to

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:13.860 
they're going to be really difficult to

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:15.649 
they're going to be really difficult to
manipulate<00:01:14.070> I<00:01:14.610> got<00:01:15.060> a<00:01:15.090> whole<00:01:15.240> bunch<00:01:15.360> of<00:01:15.479> fire

00:01:15.649 --> 00:01:15.659 
manipulate I got a whole bunch of fire

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:18.200 
manipulate I got a whole bunch of fire
starters<00:01:16.080> here<00:01:16.350> that<00:01:16.799> I'm<00:01:17.040> gonna<00:01:17.280> point<00:01:18.060> out

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:18.210 
starters here that I'm gonna point out

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:20.210 
starters here that I'm gonna point out
and<00:01:18.390> talk<00:01:18.540> about<00:01:18.659> real<00:01:18.960> quick<00:01:19.259> but<00:01:19.979> the<00:01:20.070> one

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:20.220 
and talk about real quick but the one

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:21.980 
and talk about real quick but the one
that<00:01:20.310> I<00:01:20.369> really<00:01:20.640> want<00:01:20.820> to<00:01:20.880> show<00:01:20.970> you<00:01:21.150> is<00:01:21.630> the

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:21.990 
that I really want to show you is the

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:24.620 
that I really want to show you is the
thing<00:01:22.590> that<00:01:22.710> I<00:01:22.770> came<00:01:22.830> up<00:01:23.040> with<00:01:23.189> more<00:01:23.790> a<00:01:24.060> really

00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:24.630 
thing that I came up with more a really

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:26.600 
thing that I came up with more a really
good<00:01:24.810> emergency<00:01:25.409> fire<00:01:25.619> starter<00:01:26.100> that<00:01:26.250> I<00:01:26.310> think

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:26.610 
good emergency fire starter that I think

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:28.730 
good emergency fire starter that I think
is<00:01:26.729> a<00:01:26.759> good<00:01:26.939> idea<00:01:27.060> to<00:01:27.390> carry<00:01:27.600> when<00:01:28.590> you're

00:01:28.730 --> 00:01:28.740 
is a good idea to carry when you're

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:31.429 
is a good idea to carry when you're
hiking<00:01:28.890> in<00:01:29.250> low<00:01:30.090> temperature<00:01:30.780> is<00:01:30.900> close<00:01:31.229> to

00:01:31.429 --> 00:01:31.439 
hiking in low temperature is close to

00:01:31.439 --> 00:01:33.050 
hiking in low temperature is close to
freezing<00:01:31.710> where<00:01:32.100> you're<00:01:32.250> likely<00:01:32.460> to<00:01:32.640> be<00:01:32.820> wet

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:33.060 
freezing where you're likely to be wet

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:36.260 
freezing where you're likely to be wet
and<00:01:33.740> when<00:01:34.740> you're<00:01:34.890> hiking<00:01:35.040> in<00:01:35.610> freezing

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:36.270 
and when you're hiking in freezing

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:37.399 
and when you're hiking in freezing
temperatures<00:01:36.540> where<00:01:36.930> there's<00:01:37.079> snow<00:01:37.259> on<00:01:37.290> the

00:01:37.399 --> 00:01:37.409 
temperatures where there's snow on the

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:40.460 
temperatures where there's snow on the
ground<00:01:37.500> I<00:01:37.979> just<00:01:38.579> for<00:01:38.759> safety<00:01:39.060> sake<00:01:39.470> obviously

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:40.470 
ground I just for safety sake obviously

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:42.260 
ground I just for safety sake obviously
the<00:01:40.619> first<00:01:40.740> thing<00:01:40.890> for<00:01:41.189> starting<00:01:41.460> fires<00:01:41.670> is<00:01:42.210> a

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:42.270 
the first thing for starting fires is a

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:46.760 
the first thing for starting fires is a

great way to start a fire this is my
version<00:03:07.590> of<00:03:07.860> it<00:03:08.040> instead<00:03:08.370> of<00:03:08.430> having<00:03:08.670> sawdust

00:03:09.230 --> 00:03:09.240 
version of it instead of having sawdust

00:03:09.240 --> 00:03:11.150 
version of it instead of having sawdust
it's<00:03:09.870> just<00:03:10.110> a<00:03:10.200> rolled-up<00:03:10.500> piece<00:03:10.560> of<00:03:10.860> cardboard

00:03:11.150 --> 00:03:11.160 
it's just a rolled-up piece of cardboard

00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:14.030 
it's just a rolled-up piece of cardboard
that<00:03:11.370> works<00:03:11.670> as<00:03:11.910> a<00:03:11.940> wig<00:03:12.150> and<00:03:12.990> this<00:03:13.709> will<00:03:13.890> burn

00:03:14.030 --> 00:03:14.040 
that works as a wig and this will burn

00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:15.740 
that works as a wig and this will burn
for<00:03:14.070> just<00:03:14.490> as<00:03:14.610> long<00:03:14.640> they're<00:03:15.630> pretty

trioxane yeah this is good but it it
costs<00:03:31.050> money<00:03:31.260> and<00:03:31.380> it's<00:03:31.560> harder<00:03:31.800> to<00:03:31.830> find<00:03:34.040> so

00:03:35.030 --> 00:03:35.040

00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:38.900 
yeah I think these are good and this is
more<00:03:37.500> of<00:03:37.530> an<00:03:37.740> emergency<00:03:38.100> fire<00:03:38.400> starter<00:03:38.760> than

00:03:38.900 --> 00:03:38.910 
more of an emergency fire starter than

00:03:38.910 --> 00:03:40.490 
more of an emergency fire starter than
any<00:03:39.000> of<00:03:39.120> the<00:03:39.180> rest<00:03:39.209> of<00:03:39.450> these<00:03:39.570> because<00:03:39.900> it's

00:03:40.490 --> 00:03:40.500 
any of the rest of these because it's

00:03:40.500 --> 00:03:43.340 
any of the rest of these because it's
easy<00:03:40.860> to<00:03:41.040> like<00:03:41.220> this<00:03:41.430> with<00:03:41.610> just<00:03:41.970> a<00:03:42.150> spark<00:03:42.450> but

00:03:43.340 --> 00:03:43.350 
easy to like this with just a spark but

00:03:43.350 --> 00:03:44.810 
easy to like this with just a spark but
if<00:03:43.440> all<00:03:43.560> of<00:03:43.590> your<00:03:43.830> woods<00:03:44.070> wet<00:03:44.370> it's<00:03:44.610> still

00:03:44.810 --> 00:03:44.820 
if all of your woods wet it's still

00:03:44.820 --> 00:03:46.310 
if all of your woods wet it's still
going<00:03:44.940> to<00:03:45.000> be<00:03:45.060> pretty<00:03:45.330> difficult<00:03:45.600> to<00:03:46.050> get<00:03:46.200> your

00:03:46.310 --> 00:03:46.320 
going to be pretty difficult to get your

00:03:46.320 --> 00:03:48.230 
going to be pretty difficult to get your
fire<00:03:46.500> going<00:03:46.530> quickly<00:03:47.130> when<00:03:47.850> your<00:03:47.970> hands<00:03:48.150> are

00:03:48.230 --> 00:03:48.240 
fire going quickly when your hands are

00:03:48.240 --> 00:03:49.480 
fire going quickly when your hands are
freezing

00:03:49.480 --> 00:03:49.490 
freezing

00:03:49.490 --> 00:03:53.740 
freezing
so<00:03:50.090> that<00:03:50.930> brings<00:03:51.170> me<00:03:51.350> to<00:03:51.880> my<00:03:52.880> invention<00:03:53.600> the

00:03:53.740 --> 00:03:53.750 
so that brings me to my invention the

00:03:53.750 --> 00:03:57.360 
so that brings me to my invention the
thing<00:03:53.990> that<00:03:54.200> I<00:03:54.290> came<00:03:54.350> up<00:03:54.590> with<00:03:54.940> and<00:03:55.940> that<00:03:56.930> is

00:03:57.360 --> 00:03:57.370 
thing that I came up with and that is

00:03:57.370 --> 00:04:01.570 
thing that I came up with and that is
this<00:03:58.370> is<00:03:58.520> a<00:03:58.550> tin<00:03:59.390> of<00:03:59.600> zippo<00:04:00.110> lighter<00:04:00.350> fluid<00:04:00.740> but

00:04:01.570 --> 00:04:01.580 
this is a tin of zippo lighter fluid but

00:04:01.580 --> 00:04:03.340 
this is a tin of zippo lighter fluid but
this<00:04:01.760> is<00:04:01.910> not<00:04:02.120> a<00:04:02.330> Zippo<00:04:02.630> lighter<00:04:02.870> fluid<00:04:03.260> in

00:04:03.340 --> 00:04:03.350 
this is not a Zippo lighter fluid in

00:04:03.350 --> 00:04:04.810 
this is not a Zippo lighter fluid in
this<00:04:03.500> tin<00:04:03.710> this<00:04:03.920> is<00:04:04.070> charcoal<00:04:04.490> lighter<00:04:04.730> fluid

00:04:04.810 --> 00:04:04.820 
this tin this is charcoal lighter fluid

00:04:04.820 --> 00:04:07.450 
this tin this is charcoal lighter fluid
and<00:04:05.240> the<00:04:05.620> thing<00:04:06.620> I<00:04:06.710> like<00:04:06.920> about<00:04:06.950> it<00:04:07.220> is<00:04:07.430> that

00:04:07.450 --> 00:04:07.460 
and the thing I like about it is that

00:04:07.460 --> 00:04:10.000 
and the thing I like about it is that
it's<00:04:07.700> a<00:04:07.760> very<00:04:07.940> small<00:04:08.210> container<00:04:08.660> but<00:04:09.650> these

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:10.010 
it's a very small container but these

00:04:10.010 --> 00:04:12.430 
it's a very small container but these
containers<00:04:10.520> do<00:04:10.820> not<00:04:11.000> leak<00:04:11.300> I<00:04:11.630> mean<00:04:11.990> I've

00:04:12.430 --> 00:04:12.440 
containers do not leak I mean I've

00:04:12.440 --> 00:04:13.900 
containers do not leak I mean I've
carried<00:04:12.890> these<00:04:13.100> around<00:04:13.280> in<00:04:13.430> my<00:04:13.520> pockets

00:04:13.900 --> 00:04:13.910 
carried these around in my pockets

00:04:13.910 --> 00:04:15.700 
carried these around in my pockets
before<00:04:14.090> you<00:04:14.540> can<00:04:14.690> squeeze<00:04:15.020> it<00:04:15.200> with<00:04:15.290> it<00:04:15.440> closed

00:04:15.700 --> 00:04:15.710 
before you can squeeze it with it closed

00:04:15.710 --> 00:04:17.890 
before you can squeeze it with it closed
they<00:04:16.040> don't<00:04:16.220> leak<00:04:16.459> whatsoever<00:04:17.030> so<00:04:17.570> it's<00:04:17.690> great

00:04:17.890 --> 00:04:17.900 
they don't leak whatsoever so it's great

00:04:17.900 --> 00:04:19.870 
they don't leak whatsoever so it's great
to<00:04:18.020> carrying<00:04:18.350> a<00:04:18.410> backpack<00:04:18.590> the<00:04:19.459> one<00:04:19.640> drawback

00:04:19.870 --> 00:04:19.880 
to carrying a backpack the one drawback

00:04:19.880 --> 00:04:22.150 
to carrying a backpack the one drawback
to<00:04:20.180> his<00:04:20.510> info<00:04:20.780> container<00:04:21.170> this<00:04:21.410> was<00:04:21.620> is<00:04:21.890> an

00:04:22.150 --> 00:04:22.160 
to his info container this was is an

00:04:22.160 --> 00:04:24.670 
to his info container this was is an
unmodified<00:04:22.760> one<00:04:23.000> they're<00:04:23.780> very<00:04:23.930> difficult<00:04:24.230> to

00:04:24.670 --> 00:04:24.680 
unmodified one they're very difficult to

00:04:24.680 --> 00:04:27.610 
unmodified one they're very difficult to
open<00:04:24.940> without<00:04:25.940> a<00:04:26.000> Zippo<00:04:26.540> you<00:04:26.990> use<00:04:27.200> the<00:04:27.350> lid<00:04:27.530> of

00:04:27.610 --> 00:04:27.620 
open without a Zippo you use the lid of

00:04:27.620 --> 00:04:29.740 
open without a Zippo you use the lid of
the<00:04:27.710> Zippo<00:04:28.010> to<00:04:28.130> open<00:04:28.430> this<00:04:28.580> and<00:04:29.120> so<00:04:29.450> when<00:04:29.630> your

00:04:29.740 --> 00:04:29.750 
the Zippo to open this and so when your

00:04:29.750 --> 00:04:31.300 
the Zippo to open this and so when your
fingers<00:04:30.050> are<00:04:30.200> freezing<00:04:30.440> that<00:04:31.100> would<00:04:31.220> be<00:04:31.280> a

00:04:31.300 --> 00:04:31.310 
fingers are freezing that would be a

00:04:31.310 --> 00:04:33.190 
fingers are freezing that would be a
real<00:04:31.520> difficult<00:04:31.730> thing<00:04:32.210> to<00:04:32.240> get<00:04:32.510> open<00:04:32.630> I<00:04:32.930> can't

00:04:33.190 --> 00:04:33.200 
real difficult thing to get open I can't

00:04:33.200 --> 00:04:36.130 
real difficult thing to get open I can't
even<00:04:33.260> get<00:04:33.470> my<00:04:33.560> thumbnail<00:04:33.950> in<00:04:34.160> there<00:04:34.340> now<00:04:35.140> so

00:04:36.130 --> 00:04:36.140 
even get my thumbnail in there now so

00:04:36.140 --> 00:04:38.620 
even get my thumbnail in there now so
what<00:04:36.320> I<00:04:36.350> did<00:04:36.650> so<00:04:37.550> I<00:04:37.580> took<00:04:37.670> out<00:04:37.940> my<00:04:38.090> pocket<00:04:38.300> knife

00:04:38.620 --> 00:04:38.630 
what I did so I took out my pocket knife

00:04:38.630 --> 00:04:42.340 
what I did so I took out my pocket knife
I<00:04:38.900> trimmed<00:04:39.770> out<00:04:39.920> that<00:04:40.160> edge<00:04:40.370> and<00:04:40.900> I<00:04:41.900> opened<00:04:42.230> up

00:04:42.340 --> 00:04:42.350 
I trimmed out that edge and I opened up

00:04:42.350 --> 00:04:44.080 
I trimmed out that edge and I opened up
this<00:04:42.500> whole<00:04:42.740> a<00:04:43.040> little<00:04:43.370> bit<00:04:43.490> more<00:04:43.700> so<00:04:43.910> that<00:04:43.940> it

00:04:44.080 --> 00:04:44.090 
this whole a little bit more so that it

00:04:44.090 --> 00:04:47.440 
this whole a little bit more so that it
will<00:04:44.150> squirt<00:04:44.480> more<00:04:44.720> fluid<00:04:45.110> at<00:04:45.200> once<00:04:45.380> and<00:04:46.450> the

00:04:47.440 --> 00:04:47.450 
will squirt more fluid at once and the

00:04:47.450 --> 00:04:51.250 
will squirt more fluid at once and the
easiest<00:04:47.900> way<00:04:48.140> to<00:04:49.630> to<00:04:50.630> refill<00:04:51.050> this<00:04:51.200> with

00:04:51.250 --> 00:04:51.260 
easiest way to to refill this with

00:04:51.260 --> 00:04:55.540 
easiest way to to refill this with
something<00:04:51.650> different<00:04:52.070> all<00:04:52.970> it<00:04:53.180> is<00:04:53.210> is<00:04:54.010> you<00:04:55.010> pry

00:04:55.540 --> 00:04:55.550 
something different all it is is you pry

00:04:55.550 --> 00:04:57.940 
something different all it is is you pry
that<00:04:55.580> lid<00:04:55.970> off<00:04:56.180> there's<00:04:56.870> no<00:04:56.990> screw<00:04:57.320> top<00:04:57.710> or

00:04:57.940 --> 00:04:57.950 
that lid off there's no screw top or

00:04:57.950 --> 00:04:59.140 
that lid off there's no screw top or
anything<00:04:58.280> you<00:04:58.400> just<00:04:58.430> pry<00:04:58.730> it<00:04:58.790> off<00:04:58.910> with<00:04:59.090> a

00:04:59.140 --> 00:04:59.150 
anything you just pry it off with a

00:04:59.150 --> 00:05:01.150 
anything you just pry it off with a
knife<00:04:59.330> fill<00:05:00.170> it<00:05:00.290> up<00:05:00.350> with<00:05:00.410> whatever<00:05:00.680> you<00:05:00.950> want

knife fill it up with whatever you want
it<00:05:01.760> pops<00:05:02.060> right<00:05:02.210> back<00:05:02.480> on<00:05:02.750> there<00:05:03.020> and<00:05:03.530> makes<00:05:03.950> a

00:05:04.060 --> 00:05:04.070 
it pops right back on there and makes a

00:05:04.070 --> 00:05:07.120 
it pops right back on there and makes a
real<00:05:04.310> great<00:05:04.580> seal<00:05:04.970> and<00:05:05.270> does<00:05:06.200> not<00:05:06.410> leak<00:05:06.740> once

00:05:07.120 --> 00:05:07.130 
real great seal and does not leak once

00:05:07.130 --> 00:05:10.570 
real great seal and does not leak once
it's<00:05:07.340> once<00:05:07.760> it's<00:05:07.940> on<00:05:08.090> and<00:05:08.330> closed<00:05:09.310> so<00:05:10.310> you<00:05:10.340> can

00:05:10.570 --> 00:05:10.580 
it's once it's on and closed so you can

00:05:10.580 --> 00:05:12.580 
it's once it's on and closed so you can
take<00:05:10.760> something<00:05:11.000> like<00:05:11.150> this<00:05:11.390> then<00:05:12.350> on<00:05:12.470> that

00:05:12.580 --> 00:05:12.590 
take something like this then on that

00:05:12.590 --> 00:05:14.740 
take something like this then on that
backpacking<00:05:13.220> trip<00:05:13.430> that<00:05:13.580> I<00:05:13.640> went<00:05:13.850> on<00:05:13.970> I<00:05:14.210> took

backpacking trip that I went on I took
one<00:05:15.080> of<00:05:15.200> these<00:05:15.350> and<00:05:15.860> we<00:05:16.400> split<00:05:16.670> up<00:05:16.790> would<00:05:17.120> just

00:05:17.500 --> 00:05:17.510 
one of these and we split up would just

00:05:17.510 --> 00:05:18.640 
one of these and we split up would just
like<00:05:17.630> you<00:05:17.750> would<00:05:17.840> see<00:05:18.080> on<00:05:18.110> all<00:05:18.320> the<00:05:18.440> fire

00:05:18.640 --> 00:05:18.650 
like you would see on all the fire

00:05:18.650 --> 00:05:20.230 
like you would see on all the fire
