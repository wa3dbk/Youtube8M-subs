00:00:11.420 --> 00:00:15.660
 on the arrival of this 5th stage 

00:00:14.219 --> 00:00:17.520
 we were waiting for a sprint there was 

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:19.619
 actually this sprint a strict 

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:21.180
 shattering since a fall came 

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:22.380
 disrupt runners not all 

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:24.330
 first but those who were behind 

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:25.650
 and unfortunately nacer bouhanni who has 

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:27.390
 spent today a galley day 

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:28.769
 victims of gastric problems 

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:30.750
 the elastic behind the bunch all the 

00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:32.160
 day was a victim of this fall 

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:33.480
 while he was probably thinking 

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:35.610
 does the hardest 

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:36.809
 nasser is touched he got up he is 

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:38.550
 currently in this bus or the 

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:40.020
 journalists behind me are trying 

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:41.969
 to wait for it and I think that in 

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:45.320
 a few moments we will have a 

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:45.320
 reaction of nacer bouhanni 

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:07.520
 the film 

00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:12.770
 we see these blacks really spent a 

00:01:11.259 --> 00:01:15.500
 courageous day 

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:17.860
 it's hard 

00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:17.860
 its good 

00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:27.820
 we saw a little while ago getting out of it 

00:01:26.350 --> 00:01:30.610
 he seemed to be pretty 

00:01:27.820 --> 00:01:32.500
 marked one can not argue with him no 

00:01:30.610 --> 00:01:34.170
 because I'll have a bit by 

00:01:32.500 --> 00:01:37.329
 was down on me I he was hurting 

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:40.100
 I left the doctors it's in their 

00:01:37.329 --> 00:01:42.320
 work and the jelly but really 

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:44.420
 in addition so we'll know more tonight 

00:01:42.320 --> 00:01:47.600
 do you feel that it is when 

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:50.810
 even disappointed I took these last days 

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:53.149
 the AC of the early very difficult when 

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:56.720
 we hit the ground we can be that 

00:01:53.149 --> 00:01:58.520
 angry disappointed and then then the morale in 

00:01:56.720 --> 00:02:01.280
 berne there is that on that side that's for sure 

00:01:58.520 --> 00:02:03.799
 after that he's a sprinter and the 

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:05.539
 sprinters are recognized for many 

00:02:03.799 --> 00:02:07.399
 of character and many envy so 

00:02:05.539 --> 00:02:09.619
 that is logical that they are not 

00:02:07.399 --> 00:02:11.810
 happy super choice to redo a 

00:02:09.619 --> 00:02:14.540
 health and still nice arrivals for 

00:02:11.810 --> 00:02:16.190
 respect is much less serious 

00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:18.260
 that it looked to me that assures us the 

00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:21.440
 on the finish line he has a 

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:22.730
 conclusion of square of the loins with a 

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:24.890
 modem 

00:02:22.730 --> 00:02:26.300
 muscle mass we did radios 

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:27.709
 which show no lesions so that's 

00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:30.080
 rather reassuring now he's going 

00:02:27.709 --> 00:02:32.210
 have to manage the trauma the 

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:37.670
 disappointment 

00:02:32.210 --> 00:02:40.190
 this is where the auction at 20th rank no no 

00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:41.960
 it's a lot less serious than the 

00:02:40.190 --> 00:02:43.240
 spectacular side could leave 

00:02:41.960 --> 00:02:46.220
 to fear 

00:02:43.240 --> 00:02:50.300
 and concerning the other problems of 

00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:52.340
 health who have it we'll see he has he had 

00:02:50.300 --> 00:02:54.080
 a gastro he has a good little gastro 

00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:56.570
 which is a bit like cyclical 

00:02:54.080 --> 00:02:58.490
 like that's okay and then that 

00:02:56.570 --> 00:03:01.820
 woke up again 

00:02:58.490 --> 00:03:05.930
 in the day well we go the army already a 

00:03:01.820 --> 00:03:09.010
 walk is rather reassuring to see 

00:03:05.930 --> 00:03:09.010
 standing like this and you are
