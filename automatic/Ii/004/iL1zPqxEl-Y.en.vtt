 the important thing in america and you know it 

00:00:25.789 --> 00:00:30.619
 very good to exaggerate in basketball there is 

00:00:28.760 --> 00:00:33.410
 one that exaggerates more than others 

00:00:30.619 --> 00:00:36.559
 it's shaquille o'neal the number 

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:38.660
 34 of the los angeles lakers three times 

00:00:36.559 --> 00:00:40.309
 consecutive world champions like 

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:41.290
 they love to call themselves the winning teams 

00:00:40.309 --> 00:00:43.519
 the nba 

00:00:41.290 --> 00:00:47.629
 well actually there is something 

00:00:43.519 --> 00:00:49.790
 particular in this boy 215 140 

00:00:47.629 --> 00:00:52.040
 pounds have never been carried around 

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:54.530
 for any sports field with 

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:57.680
 that speed that power that 

00:00:54.530 --> 00:01:01.640
 naturalness but jacques obviously loves 

00:00:57.680 --> 00:01:03.769
 exaggerate even outside the field is 

00:01:01.640 --> 00:01:06.020
 obsessed with the conception of 

00:01:03.769 --> 00:01:07.850
 Superman has practically tried to 

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:09.920
 withdraw all the symbols from the market 

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:12.680
 they trusted this particular character 

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:14.479
 comics and broke a hand from 

00:01:12.680 --> 00:01:16.609
 small and is the only reason why not 

00:01:14.479 --> 00:01:19.159
 has won all the championships in which he has 

00:01:16.609 --> 00:01:21.740
 played limiting it and thinking it could 

00:01:19.159 --> 00:01:23.270
 fly out of a window 

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:25.789
 today, however, it exaggerates in another sense 

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:27.159
 during the trip to Indianapolis of 

00:01:25.789 --> 00:01:28.340
 three years ago with his team 

00:01:27.159 --> 00:01:30.710
 professional 

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:33.200
 having nothing to do on the internet yes

 frankly, I don't know what use it can have 

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:43.399
 in the garden of his house by the way if 

00:01:41.659 --> 00:01:45.170
 that's what mercedes picks me up 

00:01:43.399 --> 00:01:47.630
 at the airport and you are its guests 

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:49.880
 avoid opening the trunk for 

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:51.469
 put in your bags better to keep them 

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:53.869
 on the back seat 

00:01:51.469 --> 00:01:55.969
 in the trunk there is an aquarium with 

00:01:53.869 --> 00:01:57.979
 some tropical fish with which 

00:01:55.969 --> 00:02:00.399
 objectively you can buy a
