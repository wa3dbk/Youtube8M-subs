00:00:13.809 --> 00:00:17.109 

back<00:00:14.809> in<00:00:14.990> the<00:00:15.080> fluid<00:00:15.379> shape<00:00:16.129> attributes<00:00:16.820> in

00:00:17.109 --> 00:00:17.119 
back in the fluid shape attributes in

00:00:17.119 --> 00:00:19.570 
back in the fluid shape attributes in
the<00:00:17.650> temperature<00:00:18.650> section<00:00:19.160> we<00:00:19.280> can<00:00:19.430> make<00:00:19.550> a

00:00:19.570 --> 00:00:19.580 
the temperature section we can make a

00:00:19.580 --> 00:00:22.720 
the temperature section we can make a
couple<00:00:19.910> minor<00:00:20.210> adjustments<00:00:21.050> here

00:00:22.720 --> 00:00:22.730 
couple minor adjustments here

00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:24.609 
couple minor adjustments here
we<00:00:23.029> can<00:00:23.240> maybe<00:00:23.539> give<00:00:23.900> it<00:00:23.990> a<00:00:24.020> little<00:00:24.199> bit<00:00:24.410> more

00:00:24.609 --> 00:00:24.619 
we can maybe give it a little bit more

00:00:24.619 --> 00:00:28.279 
we can maybe give it a little bit more
dissipation<00:00:25.550> but<00:00:25.880> no<00:00:26.180> diffusion

00:00:28.279 --> 00:00:28.289 
dissipation but no diffusion

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:30.620 
dissipation but no diffusion
so<00:00:29.009> that<00:00:29.310> temperature<00:00:29.789> will<00:00:29.939> fade<00:00:30.150> out<00:00:30.359> over

00:00:30.620 --> 00:00:30.630 
so that temperature will fade out over

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:33.690 
so that temperature will fade out over
time<00:00:30.839> but<00:00:30.990> it<00:00:31.109> won't<00:00:31.259> spread

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:33.700 
time but it won't spread

00:00:33.700 --> 00:00:35.280 
time but it won't spread
then<00:00:33.880> maybe<00:00:34.180> increase<00:00:34.660> the<00:00:34.840> amount<00:00:35.110> of

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:35.290 
then maybe increase the amount of

00:00:35.290 --> 00:00:38.280 
then maybe increase the amount of
turbulence<00:00:36.330> coming<00:00:37.330> from<00:00:37.630> the<00:00:37.780> turbulence

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:38.290 
turbulence coming from the turbulence

00:00:38.290 --> 00:00:40.440 
turbulence coming from the turbulence
here<00:00:38.680> so<00:00:39.340> this<00:00:39.520> is<00:00:39.700> the<00:00:39.880> amount<00:00:40.120> of<00:00:40.180> turbulence

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:40.450 
here so this is the amount of turbulence

00:00:40.450 --> 00:00:45.330 
here so this is the amount of turbulence
being<00:00:41.380> fed<00:00:41.620> into<00:00:41.770> the<00:00:41.950> temperature<00:00:42.700> and<00:00:44.340> now

00:00:45.330 --> 00:00:45.340 
being fed into the temperature and now

00:00:45.340 --> 00:00:47.040 
being fed into the temperature and now
we're<00:00:45.490> ready<00:00:45.610> to<00:00:45.730> start<00:00:45.880> playing<00:00:46.360> around<00:00:46.750> with

00:00:47.040 --> 00:00:47.050 
we're ready to start playing around with

00:00:47.050 --> 00:00:49.620 
we're ready to start playing around with
textures<00:00:47.850> scrolling<00:00:48.850> back<00:00:49.000> down<00:00:49.270> into<00:00:49.540> the

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:49.630 
textures scrolling back down into the

00:00:49.630 --> 00:00:51.880 
textures scrolling back down into the
shading<00:00:50.110> section

00:00:51.880 --> 00:00:51.890 
shading section

00:00:51.890 --> 00:00:54.590 
shading section
remember<00:00:52.890> that<00:00:53.010> we've<00:00:53.160> got<00:00:53.430> incandescent<00:00:54.120> and

00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:54.600 
remember that we've got incandescent and

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:57.680 
remember that we've got incandescent and
opacity<00:00:55.580> but<00:00:56.580> currently<00:00:57.000> they're<00:00:57.270> just<00:00:57.510> being

00:00:57.680 --> 00:00:57.690 
opacity but currently they're just being

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:03.220 
opacity but currently they're just being
driven<00:00:57.990> by<00:00:58.490> either<00:00:59.490> a<00:00:59.640> ramp<00:01:00.090> or<00:01:00.390> a<00:01:00.560> graph

00:01:03.220 --> 00:01:03.230 
driven by either a ramp or a graph

00:01:03.230 --> 00:01:04.509 
driven by either a ramp or a graph
going<00:01:03.470> down<00:01:03.620> a<00:01:03.649> little<00:01:03.829> bit<00:01:03.980> farther<00:01:04.250> you'll

00:01:04.509 --> 00:01:04.519 
going down a little bit farther you'll

00:01:04.519 --> 00:01:06.700 
going down a little bit farther you'll
see<00:01:04.790> there<00:01:05.000> is<00:01:05.089> a<00:01:05.120> textures<00:01:05.690> section<00:01:06.500> and

00:01:06.700 --> 00:01:06.710 
see there is a textures section and

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:09.580 
see there is a textures section and
there's<00:01:07.670> a<00:01:07.729> built-in<00:01:08.060> texture<00:01:08.870> for<00:01:09.170> the<00:01:09.260> fluid

00:01:09.580 --> 00:01:09.590 
there's a built-in texture for the fluid

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:12.700 
there's a built-in texture for the fluid
shaped<00:01:09.890> node<00:01:10.130> and<00:01:10.600> you<00:01:11.600> can<00:01:11.780> choose<00:01:12.200> to<00:01:12.229> either

00:01:12.700 --> 00:01:12.710 
shaped node and you can choose to either

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:17.050 
shaped node and you can choose to either
map<00:01:13.369> the<00:01:13.580> color<00:01:13.820> incandescent<00:01:14.750> or<00:01:15.229> opacity

00:01:17.050 --> 00:01:17.060 
map the color incandescent or opacity

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:19.060 
map the color incandescent or opacity
I'm<00:01:17.420> only<00:01:17.600> going<00:01:17.840> to<00:01:18.049> map<00:01:18.500> the<00:01:18.710> incandescent

00:01:19.060 --> 00:01:19.070 
I'm only going to map the incandescent

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:22.600 
I'm only going to map the incandescent
and<00:01:19.460> opacity<00:01:20.590> if<00:01:21.590> I<00:01:21.649> want<00:01:21.829> to<00:01:21.920> see<00:01:22.070> the<00:01:22.220> result

00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:22.610 
and opacity if I want to see the result

00:01:22.610 --> 00:01:24.760 
and opacity if I want to see the result
in<00:01:22.850> the<00:01:23.180> viewport<00:01:23.479> I'll<00:01:23.899> have<00:01:24.079> to<00:01:24.259> select<00:01:24.649> the

00:01:24.760 --> 00:01:24.770 
in the viewport I'll have to select the

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:27.580 
in the viewport I'll have to select the
viewport<00:01:25.280> and<00:01:25.340> press<00:01:25.579> the<00:01:25.759> six<00:01:26.030> key<00:01:26.329> and<00:01:26.590> we

00:01:27.580 --> 00:01:27.590 
viewport and press the six key and we

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:29.710 
viewport and press the six key and we
can<00:01:27.710> actually<00:01:27.860> see<00:01:28.220> the<00:01:28.369> texture<00:01:28.700> now<00:01:29.000> so<00:01:29.479> with

00:01:29.710 --> 00:01:29.720 
can actually see the texture now so with

00:01:29.720 --> 00:01:32.770 
can actually see the texture now so with
the<00:01:29.810> five<00:01:30.079> key<00:01:30.380> no<00:01:30.680> texture<00:01:31.189> six<00:01:32.180> key<00:01:32.450> shows

00:01:32.770 --> 00:01:32.780 
the five key no texture six key shows

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:35.950 
the five key no texture six key shows
the<00:01:32.960> texture<00:01:33.850> back<00:01:34.850> in<00:01:35.000> the<00:01:35.090> fluid<00:01:35.270> shape<00:01:35.659> node

00:01:35.950 --> 00:01:35.960 
the texture back in the fluid shape node

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:39.070 
the texture back in the fluid shape node
we've<00:01:36.830> got<00:01:37.100> the<00:01:37.340> incandescent<00:01:37.810> texture<00:01:38.810> gain

00:01:39.070 --> 00:01:39.080 
we've got the incandescent texture gain

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:41.740 
we've got the incandescent texture gain
and<00:01:39.409> the<00:01:39.470> opacity<00:01:39.950> texture<00:01:40.640> gain<00:01:40.850> we<00:01:41.570> can

00:01:41.740 --> 00:01:41.750 
and the opacity texture gain we can

00:01:41.750 --> 00:01:44.350 
and the opacity texture gain we can
adjust<00:01:42.079> these<00:01:42.320> to<00:01:42.740> get<00:01:43.130> different<00:01:43.340> effects<00:01:43.789> so

00:01:44.350 --> 00:01:44.360 
adjust these to get different effects so

00:01:44.360 --> 00:01:46.660 
adjust these to get different effects so
for<00:01:44.600> example<00:01:44.689> this<00:01:45.170> shows<00:01:45.470> how<00:01:45.500> much<00:01:45.979> the

00:01:46.660 --> 00:01:46.670 
for example this shows how much the

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:51.090 
for example this shows how much the
texture<00:01:47.179> is<00:01:47.210> feeding<00:01:47.689> into<00:01:47.750> the<00:01:47.960> opacity

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:51.100 

00:01:51.100 --> 00:01:53.429 

that<00:01:51.970> does<00:01:52.150> of<00:01:52.299> course<00:01:52.330> interact<00:01:53.080> with<00:01:53.229> what's

00:01:53.429 --> 00:01:53.439 
that does of course interact with what's

00:01:53.439 --> 00:01:56.280 
that does of course interact with what's
going<00:01:53.590> on<00:01:53.860> up<00:01:54.159> here<00:01:54.460> in<00:01:54.970> the<00:01:55.210> shading<00:01:55.750> section

00:01:56.280 --> 00:01:56.290 
going on up here in the shading section

00:01:56.290 --> 00:01:59.609 
going on up here in the shading section
so<00:01:57.100> under<00:01:57.340> opacity<00:01:58.000> the<00:01:58.540> input<00:01:58.900> bias<00:01:59.140> gives<00:01:59.500> a

00:01:59.609 --> 00:01:59.619 
so under opacity the input bias gives a

00:01:59.619 --> 00:02:03.190 
so under opacity the input bias gives a
similar<00:02:00.009> effect

00:02:03.190 --> 00:02:03.200 

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:05.709 

back<00:02:03.799> in<00:02:03.979> our<00:02:04.100> textures<00:02:04.610> there<00:02:05.570> are<00:02:05.630> different

00:02:05.709 --> 00:02:05.719 
back in our textures there are different

00:02:05.719 --> 00:02:08.979 
back in our textures there are different
types<00:02:05.960> of<00:02:06.409> textures<00:02:06.759> we've<00:02:07.759> got<00:02:08.060> space<00:02:08.660> time

00:02:08.979 --> 00:02:08.989 
types of textures we've got space time

00:02:08.989 --> 00:02:11.710 
types of textures we've got space time
and<00:02:09.170> that's<00:02:10.009> good<00:02:10.190> because<00:02:10.399> it<00:02:10.879> as<00:02:11.030> the<00:02:11.569> name

00:02:11.710 --> 00:02:11.720 
and that's good because it as the name

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:15.809 
and that's good because it as the name
implies<00:02:12.190> changes<00:02:13.190> over<00:02:13.700> space<00:02:14.000> and<00:02:14.269> time

00:02:15.809 --> 00:02:15.819 
implies changes over space and time

00:02:15.819 --> 00:02:19.720 
implies changes over space and time
rewind<00:02:16.819> and<00:02:17.090> play<00:02:17.269> back<00:02:18.040> so<00:02:19.040> you<00:02:19.129> can<00:02:19.280> see<00:02:19.580> the

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:19.730 
rewind and play back so you can see the

00:02:19.730 --> 00:02:23.370 
rewind and play back so you can see the
effect<00:02:20.060> of<00:02:20.150> the<00:02:20.269> space-time<00:02:20.569> texture

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:23.380 

00:02:23.380 --> 00:02:26.340 

we're<00:02:24.010> using<00:02:24.220> a<00:02:24.460> texture<00:02:24.820> to<00:02:25.330> provide<00:02:26.080> more

00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:26.350 
we're using a texture to provide more

00:02:26.350 --> 00:02:28.770 
we're using a texture to provide more
detail<00:02:27.000> just<00:02:28.000> like<00:02:28.210> we<00:02:28.360> would<00:02:28.540> with<00:02:28.600> a

00:02:28.770 --> 00:02:28.780 
detail just like we would with a

00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:32.610 
detail just like we would with a
standard<00:02:29.320> model<00:02:29.880> except<00:02:30.880> in<00:02:31.090> a<00:02:31.330> model<00:02:31.720> the

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:32.620 
standard model except in a model the

00:02:32.620 --> 00:02:35.040 
standard model except in a model the

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:35.050 
shape is coming from the geometry and

00:02:35.050 --> 00:02:37.260

here<00:02:35.860> the<00:02:35.980> shape<00:02:36.220> is<00:02:36.400> coming<00:02:36.790> from<00:02:36.970> the

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:37.270 
here the shape is coming from the

00:02:37.270 --> 00:02:40.770 
here the shape is coming from the
dynamic<00:02:38.170> grid<00:02:38.820> which<00:02:39.820> is<00:02:40.060> driving<00:02:40.600> the

00:02:40.770 --> 00:02:40.780 
dynamic grid which is driving the

00:02:40.780 --> 00:02:42.500 
dynamic grid which is driving the

00:02:42.510 --> 00:02:46.429 
opacity
from<00:02:43.260> the<00:02:43.439> density<00:02:44.510> so<00:02:45.510> density<00:02:45.840> is<00:02:46.049> feeding

00:02:46.429 --> 00:02:46.439

into opacity pacity is creating a shape

00:02:49.379 --> 00:02:52.309 
into opacity pacity is creating a shape
and<00:02:49.650> then<00:02:50.430> we're<00:02:50.730> modifying<00:02:51.180> that<00:02:51.689> shape<00:02:52.079> by

00:02:52.309 --> 00:02:52.319 
and then we're modifying that shape by

00:02:52.319 --> 00:02:57.450 
and then we're modifying that shape by
layering<00:02:52.790> this<00:02:53.790> texture<00:02:54.450> opacity

00:02:57.450 --> 00:02:57.460 

00:02:57.460 --> 00:02:59.160 

more<00:02:57.580> interesting<00:02:58.060> we<00:02:58.180> can<00:02:58.360> play<00:02:58.570> around<00:02:58.840> with

we<00:03:24.440> want<00:03:24.650> a<00:03:24.709> little<00:03:24.860> bit<00:03:25.040> better<00:03:25.250> display<00:03:25.909> in

00:03:26.140 --> 00:03:26.150 
we want a little bit better display in

00:03:26.150 --> 00:03:29.820 
we want a little bit better display in
here<00:03:26.360> we<00:03:26.480> can<00:03:26.599> go<00:03:26.750> back<00:03:26.930> up<00:03:27.200> to

00:03:29.820 --> 00:03:29.830 

00:03:29.830 --> 00:03:32.870 

the<00:03:30.400> display<00:03:30.940> section<00:03:31.330> way<00:03:31.900> back<00:03:32.200> up<00:03:32.410> here<00:03:32.740> and

00:03:32.870 --> 00:03:32.880 
the display section way back up here and

00:03:32.880 --> 00:03:38.280 
the display section way back up here and
increase<00:03:33.880> the<00:03:34.000> number<00:03:34.240> of<00:03:34.270> slices<00:03:34.600> per<00:03:34.930> voxel

00:03:38.280 --> 00:03:38.290 

00:03:38.290 --> 00:03:40.979 

I'll<00:03:38.439> help<00:03:38.620> without<00:03:38.860> a<00:03:38.920> little<00:03:39.159> bit<00:03:39.780> so<00:03:40.780> way

00:03:40.979 --> 00:03:40.989 
I'll help without a little bit so way

00:03:40.989 --> 00:03:43.199 
I'll help without a little bit so way
back<00:03:41.019> down<00:03:41.560> once<00:03:41.860> again<00:03:42.219> in<00:03:42.549> our<00:03:42.670> texture

00:03:43.199 --> 00:03:43.209 
back down once again in our texture

00:03:43.209 --> 00:03:45.959 
back down once again in our texture
attributes<00:03:43.780> I<00:03:44.250> can<00:03:45.250> play<00:03:45.459> around<00:03:45.549> with<00:03:45.879> this

00:03:45.959 --> 00:03:45.969 
attributes I can play around with this

00:03:45.969 --> 00:03:49.319 
attributes I can play around with this
frequency<00:03:46.480> and<00:03:47.159> of<00:03:48.159> course<00:03:48.370> i<00:03:48.519> can<00:03:48.670> use<00:03:48.790> IP<00:03:49.000> are

00:03:49.319 --> 00:03:49.329 
frequency and of course i can use IP are

00:03:49.329 --> 00:03:51.660 
frequency and of course i can use IP are
too

00:03:51.660 --> 00:03:51.670 
too

00:03:51.670 --> 00:03:55.230 
too
so<00:03:52.360> I'll<00:03:52.569> select<00:03:52.840> these<00:03:53.230> pixels<00:03:53.920> and<00:03:54.250> then

00:03:55.230 --> 00:03:55.240 
so I'll select these pixels and then

00:03:55.240 --> 00:03:58.260 
so I'll select these pixels and then
play<00:03:55.480> with<00:03:55.660> that<00:03:55.810> frequency

00:03:58.260 --> 00:03:58.270 

00:03:58.270 --> 00:04:00.410 

let's<00:03:58.480> go<00:03:58.660> back<00:03:58.870> into<00:03:59.110> the<00:03:59.260> shading<00:04:00.070> and

00:04:00.410 --> 00:04:00.420 
let's go back into the shading and

00:04:00.420 --> 00:04:03.660 
let's go back into the shading and
adjust<00:04:01.420> the<00:04:01.510> input<00:04:01.690> bias<00:04:02.140> of<00:04:02.670> the

00:04:03.660 --> 00:04:03.670 
adjust the input bias of the

00:04:03.670 --> 00:04:10.590 
adjust the input bias of the
incandescent

00:04:10.590 --> 00:04:10.600 

00:04:10.600 --> 00:04:14.550 

so<00:04:11.230> we<00:04:11.290> can<00:04:11.380> see<00:04:11.560> the<00:04:11.650> texture<00:04:11.980> better<00:04:13.560> so

00:04:14.550 --> 00:04:14.560 
so we can see the texture better so

00:04:14.560 --> 00:04:17.520 
so we can see the texture better so
frequency<00:04:15.180> low<00:04:16.180> frequency<00:04:16.750> will<00:04:16.990> be<00:04:17.140> a<00:04:17.170> large

00:04:17.520 --> 00:04:17.530 
frequency low frequency will be a large

00:04:17.530 --> 00:04:19.690 
frequency low frequency will be a large
pattern

00:04:19.690 --> 00:04:19.700 
pattern

00:04:19.700 --> 00:04:23.890 
pattern
I frequency<00:04:20.530> will<00:04:21.530> be<00:04:21.560> a<00:04:21.680> small<00:04:22.040> pattern<00:04:22.900> we

00:04:23.890 --> 00:04:23.900 
I frequency will be a small pattern we

00:04:23.900 --> 00:04:24.810 
I frequency will be a small pattern we
can<00:04:24.050> also<00:04:24.170> stretch

00:04:24.810 --> 00:04:24.820 
can also stretch

00:04:24.820 --> 00:04:26.550 
can also stretch
the<00:04:24.910> texture<00:04:25.330> you'll<00:04:25.510> see<00:04:25.750> text<00:04:26.080> your<00:04:26.200> scale

00:04:26.550 --> 00:04:26.560 
the texture you'll see text your scale

00:04:26.560 --> 00:04:29.730 
the texture you'll see text your scale
here<00:04:27.030> so<00:04:28.030> if<00:04:28.120> I<00:04:28.240> stretch<00:04:28.510> it<00:04:28.570> in<00:04:28.840> y<00:04:29.050> x<00:04:29.350> value<00:04:29.710> of

00:04:29.730 --> 00:04:29.740 
here so if I stretch it in y x value of

00:04:29.740 --> 00:04:33.430 
here so if I stretch it in y x value of
2<00:04:29.940> it'll<00:04:30.940> stretch<00:04:31.240> out<00:04:31.480> vertically

00:04:33.430 --> 00:04:33.440 
2 it'll stretch out vertically

00:04:33.440 --> 00:04:36.250 
2 it'll stretch out vertically
the<00:04:34.190> texture<00:04:34.520> origin<00:04:34.970> is<00:04:35.090> the<00:04:35.180> placement<00:04:35.450> so

00:04:36.250 --> 00:04:36.260 
the texture origin is the placement so

00:04:36.260 --> 00:04:37.630 
the texture origin is the placement so
if<00:04:36.350> I<00:04:36.410> change<00:04:36.710> this<00:04:36.770> to<00:04:37.010> just<00:04:37.160> a<00:04:37.310> very<00:04:37.520> small

00:04:37.630 --> 00:04:37.640 
if I change this to just a very small

00:04:37.640 --> 00:04:41.890 
if I change this to just a very small
value<00:04:38.270> like<00:04:38.510> point<00:04:39.350> 01<00:04:39.560> and<00:04:40.190> hit<00:04:41.030> enter<00:04:41.240> you

can<00:04:42.050> see<00:04:42.260> it<00:04:42.350> shift<00:04:42.680> a<00:04:42.920> bit<00:04:42.950> down<00:04:43.660> point<00:04:44.660> oh

00:04:44.740 --> 00:04:44.750 
can see it shift a bit down point oh

00:04:44.750 --> 00:04:48.640 
can see it shift a bit down point oh
five<00:04:45.490> shifts<00:04:46.490> down<00:04:46.640> more<00:04:47.200> so<00:04:48.200> I<00:04:48.230> can<00:04:48.410> put<00:04:48.560> an

00:04:48.640 --> 00:04:48.650 
five shifts down more so I can put an

00:05:07.520 --> 00:05:10.850 
and I'll set that equal to time / let's
say<00:05:07.789> 10<00:05:08.240> and<00:05:08.569> then<00:05:09.110> a<00:05:09.139> semicolon

00:05:10.850 --> 00:05:10.860 
say 10 and then a semicolon

00:05:10.860 --> 00:05:15.910 
say 10 and then a semicolon
create<00:05:11.729> that<00:05:11.969> expression<00:05:12.509> and<00:05:13.430> then

00:05:15.910 --> 00:05:15.920 
create that expression and then

00:05:15.920 --> 00:05:19.240 
create that expression and then
rewind<00:05:16.220> and<00:05:16.430> play<00:05:16.580> back<00:05:17.470> the<00:05:18.470> texture<00:05:18.950> is<00:05:18.980> now

00:05:26.929 --> 00:05:26.939 

00:05:26.939 --> 00:05:30.719 

we<00:05:27.939> can<00:05:28.089> put<00:05:28.269> this<00:05:28.449> in<00:05:29.279> interactive<00:05:30.279> playback

00:05:30.719 --> 00:05:30.729 
we can put this in interactive playback

00:05:30.729 --> 00:05:34.019 
we can put this in interactive playback
mode<00:05:31.199> let<00:05:32.199> that<00:05:32.229> play<00:05:32.559> through<00:05:32.949> and<00:05:33.159> then<00:05:33.309> make

my<00:05:45.699> simulation<00:05:46.360> is<00:05:46.509> looking<00:05:46.839> good<00:05:47.019> I'll<00:05:47.559> do

00:05:47.969 --> 00:05:47.979 
my simulation is looking good I'll do

00:05:47.979 --> 00:05:50.399 
my simulation is looking good I'll do
some<00:05:48.189> test<00:05:48.459> renders<00:05:48.819> you<00:05:49.419> might<00:05:49.599> want<00:05:49.779> to<00:05:49.869> do<00:05:50.050> a

00:05:50.399 --> 00:05:50.409 
some test renders you might want to do a

00:05:50.409 --> 00:05:53.610 
some test renders you might want to do a
play<00:05:51.129> blast<00:05:51.429> as<00:05:51.729> well

00:05:53.610 --> 00:05:53.620 
play blast as well

00:05:53.620 --> 00:05:57.180 
play blast as well
but<00:05:54.040> now<00:05:54.190> is<00:05:54.370> where<00:05:54.550> you<00:05:54.760> sort<00:05:55.030> of<00:05:55.090> develop

00:05:57.180 --> 00:05:57.190 
but now is where you sort of develop

00:05:57.190 --> 00:05:59.760 
but now is where you sort of develop
your<00:05:57.340> shot<00:05:57.610> and<00:05:58.380> fine-tuned<00:05:59.380> all<00:05:59.620> the

00:05:59.760 --> 00:05:59.770 
your shot and fine-tuned all the

00:05:59.770 --> 00:06:07.700 
your shot and fine-tuned all the
artistic<00:06:00.340> details

00:06:07.700 --> 00:06:07.710 

00:06:07.710 --> 00:06:10.730 

so<00:06:08.340> I<00:06:08.400> just<00:06:08.610> made<00:06:08.820> it<00:06:08.850> brighter<00:06:09.150> I<00:06:09.560> can<00:06:10.560> maybe

00:06:10.730 --> 00:06:10.740 
so I just made it brighter I can maybe

00:06:10.740 --> 00:06:13.190 
so I just made it brighter I can maybe
go<00:06:10.980> back<00:06:11.160> into<00:06:11.400> the<00:06:11.460> opacity<00:06:11.880> and<00:06:12.360> do

00:06:13.190 --> 00:06:13.200 
go back into the opacity and do

00:06:13.200 --> 00:06:16.050 
go back into the opacity and do
something<00:06:13.590> clever<00:06:13.920> here<00:06:14.400> maybe

00:06:16.050 --> 00:06:16.060 
something clever here maybe

00:06:16.060 --> 00:06:19.260 
something clever here maybe
so<00:06:16.690> I<00:06:16.720> played<00:06:17.110> around<00:06:17.260> with<00:06:17.620> my<00:06:18.130> fluid<00:06:18.970> shape

00:06:19.260 --> 00:06:19.270 
so I played around with my fluid shape

00:06:19.270 --> 00:06:21.690 
so I played around with my fluid shape
opacity<00:06:19.750> curve<00:06:20.350> a<00:06:20.530> little<00:06:20.560> bit<00:06:20.919> more<00:06:21.220> to<00:06:21.550> give

00:06:21.690 --> 00:06:21.700 
opacity curve a little bit more to give

00:06:21.700 --> 00:06:25.140 
opacity curve a little bit more to give
it<00:06:21.790> a<00:06:21.880> softer<00:06:22.330> edge<00:06:22.540> and<00:06:23.400> I<00:06:24.400> think<00:06:24.639> I'm<00:06:24.850> happy

00:06:25.140 --> 00:06:25.150 
it a softer edge and I think I'm happy

00:06:25.150 --> 00:06:27.930 
it a softer edge and I think I'm happy
with<00:06:25.389> that<00:06:25.770> then<00:06:26.770> go<00:06:26.919> back<00:06:27.130> down<00:06:27.190> into<00:06:27.700> the

00:06:27.930 --> 00:06:27.940 
with that then go back down into the

00:06:27.940 --> 00:06:30.060 
with that then go back down into the
text<00:06:28.270> or<00:06:28.360> attributes<00:06:28.960> and<00:06:29.200> take<00:06:29.380> a<00:06:29.410> final<00:06:29.770> pass

00:06:30.060 --> 00:06:30.070 
text or attributes and take a final pass

00:06:30.070 --> 00:06:33.510 
text or attributes and take a final pass
at<00:06:30.370> those<00:06:30.580> for<00:06:31.360> example<00:06:31.389> the<00:06:32.139> depth<00:06:32.440> max<00:06:32.770> let's

00:06:33.510 --> 00:06:33.520 
at those for example the depth max let's

00:06:33.520 --> 00:06:38.530 
at those for example the depth max let's
do<00:06:33.669> an<00:06:33.820> IPR<00:06:34.270> render

00:06:38.530 --> 00:06:38.540 

00:06:38.540 --> 00:06:42.310 

increase<00:06:39.110> that<00:06:39.140> up<00:06:39.530> two<00:06:39.740> maybe<00:06:40.160> three<00:06:40.550> for<00:06:41.320> the

00:06:42.310 --> 00:06:42.320 
increase that up two maybe three for the

00:06:42.320 --> 00:06:44.380 
increase that up two maybe three for the
higher<00:06:42.560> this<00:06:42.800> value<00:06:42.980> the<00:06:43.460> more<00:06:43.640> detail<00:06:44.120> will

00:06:44.380 --> 00:06:44.390 
higher this value the more detail will

00:06:44.390 --> 00:06:47.350 
higher this value the more detail will
see<00:06:44.630> in<00:06:44.810> the<00:06:44.870> texture<00:06:45.830> and<00:06:46.030> that<00:06:47.030> does

00:06:47.350 --> 00:06:47.360 
see in the texture and that does

00:06:47.360 --> 00:06:50.290 
see in the texture and that does
interact<00:06:47.840> with<00:06:48.020> the<00:06:48.110> frequency<00:06:48.650> here<00:06:49.270> so<00:06:50.270> a

00:06:50.290 --> 00:06:50.300 
interact with the frequency here so a

00:06:50.300 --> 00:06:53.620 
interact with the frequency here so a
lower<00:06:50.690> frequency<00:06:51.850> with<00:06:52.850> an<00:06:52.970> increased<00:06:53.330> depth

00:06:53.620 --> 00:06:53.630 
lower frequency with an increased depth

00:06:53.630 --> 00:06:57.820 
lower frequency with an increased depth
max<00:06:54.040> give<00:06:55.040> me<00:06:55.070> a<00:06:55.270> different<00:06:56.270> pattern<00:06:56.710> if<00:06:57.710> I

00:06:57.820 --> 00:06:57.830 
max give me a different pattern if I

00:06:57.830 --> 00:07:00.100 
max give me a different pattern if I
want<00:06:58.040> to<00:06:58.130> add<00:06:58.280> some<00:06:58.910> more<00:06:59.060> chaos<00:06:59.510> to<00:06:59.720> this<00:06:59.900> I

00:07:00.100 --> 00:07:00.110 
want to add some more chaos to this I

00:07:00.110 --> 00:07:03.100 
want to add some more chaos to this I
can<00:07:00.980> also<00:07:01.430> put<00:07:01.910> a<00:07:01.940> creation<00:07:02.390> expression<00:07:02.960> in

00:07:03.100 --> 00:07:03.110 
can also put a creation expression in

00:07:03.110 --> 00:07:05.950 
can also put a creation expression in
the<00:07:03.230> texture<00:07:03.680> time<00:07:03.980> field<00:07:04.430> if<00:07:05.180> I<00:07:05.330> just<00:07:05.510> adjust

00:07:05.950 --> 00:07:05.960 
the texture time field if I just adjust

00:07:05.960 --> 00:07:07.480 
the texture time field if I just adjust
this<00:07:06.110> you<00:07:06.320> will<00:07:06.410> sort<00:07:06.680> of<00:07:06.770> see<00:07:06.950> what<00:07:07.100> happens

00:07:07.480 --> 00:07:07.490 
this you will sort of see what happens

00:07:07.490 --> 00:07:10.810 
this you will sort of see what happens
it's<00:07:07.700> it's<00:07:08.300> causing<00:07:08.870> the<00:07:09.500> texture<00:07:10.070> to<00:07:10.310> churn

00:07:10.810 --> 00:07:10.820 
it's it's causing the texture to churn

00:07:10.820 --> 00:07:16.090 
it's it's causing the texture to churn
or<00:07:11.530> boil<00:07:12.530> it's<00:07:13.370> like<00:07:13.550> a<00:07:13.580> phase<00:07:14.030> attribute<00:07:14.840> so<00:07:15.740> I

00:07:16.090 --> 00:07:16.100 
or boil it's like a phase attribute so I

00:07:16.100 --> 00:07:18.280 
or boil it's like a phase attribute so I

at this stage because we've introduced

chaos from the turbulence and we've also
