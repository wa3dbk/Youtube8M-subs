00:00:45.280 --> 00:00:50.290
 pokémon level 100 I've spent I 

00:00:47.170 --> 00:00:53.990
 of my personal departure d 

00:00:50.290 --> 00:00:57.890

00:00:53.990 --> 00:01:00.410
 mine then with a pokémon at level 100 

00:00:57.890 --> 00:01:04.129
 whatever the place will appear 

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:06.410
 mirage in which they reside reside or they 

00:01:04.129 --> 00:01:08.720
 believe then here, we already have to 

00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:10.870
 call him to call dairy so that 

00:01:08.720 --> 00:01:13.800

00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:24.410
 ball that is where we really are or 

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:26.590
 be that I should go out near here to 

00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:26.590
 watch 

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:33.350
 does not leave grandfather, not what is a 

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:35.750
 stop to stop so I thought that 

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:37.980
 it was a one thing in heaven but it is not 

00:01:35.750 --> 00:01:39.590
 a place 

00:01:37.980 --> 00:01:42.189
 I think 

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:42.189
 Let's see 

00:01:43.150 --> 00:01:46.140
 I do not see anything 

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:53.220
 here forgiveness uncertain cave forgiveness that is 

00:01:50.730 --> 00:01:56.490
 that I did not remember where I was with what 

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:58.080
 which I did not leave but if it's there 

00:01:56.490 --> 00:02:00.350
 next to the city badly balona there is 

00:01:58.080 --> 00:02:02.520
 look for what the uncertain cave is worth 

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:04.770
 it only comes out if we're a little cool 

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:06.600
 fun on our team so 

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:09.570
 good or how nice is all this about the 

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:11.550
 demo not this just in the demo I think one of 

00:02:09.570 --> 00:02:13.650
 these places 

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:14.940
 a burning pressure takes over the 

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:18.960
 atmosphere 

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:21.600
 juho is good here we have the ring this 

00:02:18.960 --> 00:02:23.970
 rare dejupa that seems dejupa let's go no 

00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:26.250
 is confirmed but is one of the 

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:27.600
 Big rumors of blonde embarrassed ferocious 

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:30.000
 alpha that these beings are judging 

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:31.450
 so then let's put our hands 

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:34.560
 here 

00:02:31.450 --> 00:02:34.560
 and here comes 

00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:42.170

00:02:38.980 --> 00:02:45.080
 this is very cool I like it 

00:02:42.170 --> 00:02:48.790
 turbo called reside good does not matter 

00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:48.790
 let's paralyze 

00:02:49.710 --> 00:02:52.520
 that's 

00:02:53.630 --> 00:02:58.220
 this is paralyzed swallow breath not 

00:02:56.630 --> 00:03:01.370
 should do too much damage either 

00:02:58.220 --> 00:03:03.080
 good and we see each other with false smack 

00:03:01.370 --> 00:03:05.810
 from the beginning since this one does not have 

00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:08.209
 a resistant type to normal 

00:03:05.810 --> 00:03:09.470

00:03:08.209 --> 00:03:10.920
 After a little more legendary 

00:03:09.470 --> 00:03:12.720

00:03:32.550 --> 00:03:37.370

00:03:48.250 --> 00:03:55.550
 52 if I get to 32 the strip pull the 

00:03:52.840 --> 00:03:59.120
 shift so far has not been necessary 

00:03:55.550 --> 00:04:04.209
 but you never know anything 

00:03:59.120 --> 00:04:04.209
 the paralyzed pokemon has escaped 

00:04:04.300 --> 00:04:10.950

 until level 100 but step why 

00:04:33.950 --> 00:04:39.500

00:04:37.760 --> 00:04:43.780
 called fusion and sends it the way by 

00:04:39.500 --> 00:04:45.790
