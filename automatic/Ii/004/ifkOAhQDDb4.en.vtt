00:00:02.770 --> 00:00:09.019
 peace to you mark4 pride of israeli 

00:00:06.529 --> 00:00:10.190
 army main battle tank land 

00:00:09.019 --> 00:00:13.009
 tsahala troops 

00:00:10.190 --> 00:00:16.070
 on technical equipment of this tank 

00:00:13.009 --> 00:00:18.890
 no match in the world that's why he 

00:00:16.070 --> 00:00:22.720
 considered to be invincible in the world 

00:00:18.890 --> 00:00:22.720
 called the sacred chariot 

00:00:23.520 --> 00:00:28.120
 the main criterion in the development of the tank 

00:00:25.870 --> 00:00:30.760
 merkava for israeli designers 

00:00:28.120 --> 00:00:33.040
 it became the safety of the crew therefore 

00:00:30.760 --> 00:00:35.350
 the engine they placed is not in the stern 

00:00:33.040 --> 00:00:38.860
 as it usually happens in a bow 

00:00:35.350 --> 00:00:41.120
 fighting machine because of this team 

00:00:38.860 --> 00:00:42.860
 shifted a little back 

00:00:41.120 --> 00:00:45.440
 Now if the enemy shell pierces 

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:47.870
 tank front armor engine will exit 

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:50.660
 building but it will work as an extra 

00:00:47.870 --> 00:00:51.530
 shield and the tankers will remain intact and 

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:54.469
 unharmed 

00:00:51.530 --> 00:00:57.170
 ate the only country in the world that 

00:00:54.469 --> 00:00:59.390
 serially produces tanks with front 

00:00:57.170 --> 00:01:00.250
 the location of the motor-transmission 

00:00:59.390 --> 00:01:02.870
 branches 

00:01:00.250 --> 00:01:04.970
 this is one of the plastic options 

00:01:02.870 --> 00:01:08.800
 layouts but nevertheless they have 

00:01:04.970 --> 00:01:12.619
 located in front of the engine and in the stern 

00:01:08.800 --> 00:01:14.390
 located fighting compartment for 

00:01:12.619 --> 00:01:16.179
 ensure complete crew safety 

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:18.830
 on the world of whom was installed 

00:01:16.179 --> 00:01:21.170
 layered armor did it 

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:23.990
 Israeli tank virtually invulnerable 

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:25.399
 it's hard to knock both kinetic and 

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:27.380
 cumulative shells 

00:01:25.399 --> 00:01:29.659
 that is, those that are stuffed 

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:31.700
 explosive and lexa vein and can 

00:01:29.659 --> 00:01:33.830
 burn tank armor practically 

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:36.170
 through and 

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:38.060
 Israeli tank armor difficult to burn 

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:40.150
 because by its structure it 

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:42.650
 resembles a layered cake with 

00:01:40.150 --> 00:01:43.280
 the rest of the layer should be a layer of 

00:01:42.650 --> 00:01:46.160
 ceramics 

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:47.490
 then kevlar then ceramics again and 

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:49.350
 steel 

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:51.600
 thus, with the defeat of the tank 

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:52.820
 the enemy shell is braked first 

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:55.290
 layered armor 

00:01:52.820 --> 00:01:58.040
 thanks to this merkava remains 

00:01:55.290 --> 00:01:58.040
 unscathed 

00:01:58.220 --> 00:02:04.590
 in the case of a multilayer barrier if in 

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:08.899
 start focusing on b on the surface of the armor 

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:11.700
 breaks from this steel 1 sheet 

00:02:08.899 --> 00:02:14.970
 composite materials disperse 

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:15.600
 jet and inner layer is the third layer 

00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:19.860
 good not 

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:22.080
 It does not break through the whole multi-layer 

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:24.240
 booking reliably protects the tank 

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:28.620
 true today and can brag 

00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:30.690
 almost all tanks of the world are like composite 

00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:32.989
 armor was used in the 60s 

00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:38.070
 last century, Soviet designers 

00:02:32.989 --> 00:02:40.140
 equipped it with a tank t-64 but the complex 

00:02:38.070 --> 00:02:41.989
 active protection which israeli 

00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:45.630
 gunsmiths equipped their merkavu 

00:02:41.989 --> 00:02:48.030
 unique development of such a system no 

00:02:45.630 --> 00:02:51.540
 not a single tank in the world but American 

00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:54.360

 or 

00:02:55.049 --> 00:03:01.140
 tanks strengthened systems are being developed 

00:02:58.409 --> 00:03:02.819
 active protection for tanks steps and their 

00:03:01.140 --> 00:03:04.829
 food for game 

00:03:02.819 --> 00:03:06.930
 al-kaym in all the armies of the world understand 

00:03:04.829 --> 00:03:09.120
 as in general, it became clear to us about the knee 

00:03:06.930 --> 00:03:11.579
 usa ducato to protect the tank 

00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:13.739
 from all sides passing and need to create 

00:03:11.579 --> 00:03:15.840
 I call the lesson still us machine 

00:03:13.739 --> 00:03:18.510
 different from existing before 

00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:22.040
 technologies can megan axis wet just 

00:03:18.510 --> 00:03:25.409
 managed to make it 1 goal and Iâ€™m al fu 

00:03:22.040 --> 00:03:27.689
 trail is the name of the Israeli designers 

00:03:25.409 --> 00:03:29.329
 gave their complex an active defense against 

00:03:27.689 --> 00:03:32.430
 anti-tank shells 

00:03:29.329 --> 00:03:36.090
 his main task is to protect the merkavu 

00:03:32.430 --> 00:03:38.519
 any looming danger acts 

00:03:36.090 --> 00:03:40.200
 he follows on the tank tower 

00:03:38.519 --> 00:03:42.870
 4 radars are installed 

00:03:40.200 --> 00:03:45.720
 all day and night they follow the situation on 

00:03:42.870 --> 00:03:47.819
 the battlefield in the cockpit is a computer 

00:03:45.720 --> 00:03:50.220
 read from these radar information 

00:03:47.819 --> 00:03:51.930
 as soon as the enemy shell is in 

00:03:50.220 --> 00:03:54.389
 visibility system trophy 

00:03:51.930 --> 00:03:56.449
 an alarm is sent to the computer 

00:03:54.389 --> 00:03:58.769
 after that the computer is practically 

00:03:56.449 --> 00:04:01.019
 instantly determines where it goes from 

00:03:58.769 --> 00:04:03.060
 fire calculates the flight path 

00:04:01.019 --> 00:04:06.680
 enemy projectile and gives the command 

00:04:03.060 --> 00:04:06.680
 countermeasure system 

00:04:08.030 --> 00:04:13.080
 she launches special anti-missiles 

00:04:11.160 --> 00:04:13.590
 who are flying towards the enemy 

00:04:13.080 --> 00:04:16.680
 projectile 

00:04:13.590 --> 00:04:20.019
 bonding with him explode forming 

00:04:16.680 --> 00:04:22.150
 huge cloud of fragments 

00:04:20.019 --> 00:04:24.669
 but the most amazing complex is active 

00:04:22.150 --> 00:04:26.949
 protection tank merkava can reflect 

00:04:24.669 --> 00:04:32.110
 simultaneously several attacks with 

00:04:26.949 --> 00:04:34.060
 different sides and to whom this system 

00:04:32.110 --> 00:04:36.729
 equipped with two devices for 

00:04:34.060 --> 00:04:39.190
 interception if missiles were fired from two 

00:04:36.729 --> 00:04:41.259
 the sides because both devices are independent 

00:04:39.190 --> 00:04:42.970
 one by one account he started to take off 

00:04:41.259 --> 00:04:44.919
 your base system is able 

00:04:42.970 --> 00:04:47.080
 watch out for more threats 

00:04:44.919 --> 00:04:48.759
 simultaneously and able to neutralize 

00:04:47.080 --> 00:04:52.860
 several on both sides at the same time 

00:04:48.759 --> 00:04:56.490
 Schmitt was awake and able to have mobile phones 

00:04:52.860 --> 00:04:56.490
 Israeli tank Mirko 

00:04:58.080 --> 00:05:02.979
 120mm smoothbore gun 

00:05:00.690 --> 00:05:04.960
 actually guns of this caliber 

00:05:02.979 --> 00:05:08.530
 equipped with many modern tanks 

00:05:04.960 --> 00:05:10.110
 but the gun is merkava especially she is capable 

00:05:08.530 --> 00:05:13.289
 shoot hyper sound 

00:05:10.110 --> 00:05:13.289
 anti-tank shells 

00:05:13.620 --> 00:05:18.300
 such shells are equipped with air 

00:05:15.690 --> 00:05:18.900
 jet engines it means that in 

00:05:18.300 --> 00:05:21.240
 flying 

00:05:18.900 --> 00:05:23.400
 they do not lose speed at all in contrast 

00:05:21.240 --> 00:05:25.710
 from conventional shells therefore 

00:05:23.400 --> 00:05:29.360
 hypersonic shells fly further a 

00:05:25.710 --> 00:05:29.360
 more damage they do 

00:05:30.310 --> 00:05:35.740
 just imagine such shells 

00:05:32.980 --> 00:05:38.920
 able to flash the armor of three tanks at once 

00:05:35.740 --> 00:05:40.720
 apart from this world 

00:05:38.920 --> 00:05:47.530
 you can fire special 

00:05:40.720 --> 00:05:49.870
 bombs cassette which to 

00:05:47.530 --> 00:05:53.290
 allows you to work against fortifications . 

00:05:49.870 --> 00:05:56.770
 he first breaks the wall and then 

00:05:53.290 --> 00:05:59.430
 inside the cassette explodes which 

00:05:56.770 --> 00:06:02.560
 contain which are striking elements 

00:05:59.430 --> 00:06:04.240
 in addition to the hypersonic projectile and bomb 

00:06:02.560 --> 00:06:07.300
 cassettes died anyone can shoot 

00:06:04.240 --> 00:06:09.250
 guided missiles of allah these 

00:06:07.300 --> 00:06:10.840
 unique shells capable of destroying 

00:06:09.250 --> 00:06:12.650
 not only bow armored vehicles or 

00:06:10.840 --> 00:06:15.770
 enemy fortifications 

00:06:12.650 --> 00:06:17.419
 boats and even cities a flying rocket flies 

00:06:15.770 --> 00:06:20.660
 with a significant excess on 

00:06:17.419 --> 00:06:24.169
 trajectories and decreases to the level of the goal 

00:06:20.660 --> 00:06:27.520
 height mean literally 150 

00:06:24.169 --> 00:06:30.740
 200 meters to the target this mode allows 

00:06:27.520 --> 00:06:33.949
 overcome there shrubs undersized 

00:06:30.740 --> 00:06:39.080
 trees and so on security order 

00:06:33.949 --> 00:06:41.180
 that the rocket will fall on the trajectory except 

00:06:39.080 --> 00:06:43.520
 main guns on the tower merkavy 

00:06:41.180 --> 00:06:46.160
 placed two machine guns and on the sides 

00:06:43.520 --> 00:06:48.139
 smoke grenade launchers if you need a tank 

00:06:46.160 --> 00:06:48.710
 retreat from the battlefield or at the time 

00:06:48.139 --> 00:06:51.260
 disappear 

00:06:48.710 --> 00:06:53.979
 he shoots special grenades in 

00:06:51.260 --> 00:06:57.110
 tank lined air smoke screen 

00:06:53.979 --> 00:07:00.020
 can save him from destruction there is 

00:06:57.110 --> 00:07:01.490
 such a remedy like these smoke here 

00:07:00.020 --> 00:07:04.789
 rocket launchers for literally 

00:07:01.490 --> 00:07:06.800
 few seconds on modern 

00:07:04.789 --> 00:07:09.139
 grenade launcher them this time is from 

00:07:06.800 --> 00:07:11.110
 one and a half to three seconds tank can 

00:07:09.139 --> 00:07:13.810
 put a smoke screen 

00:07:11.110 --> 00:07:16.570
 which will hide him from sight 

00:07:13.810 --> 00:07:19.190
 helicopter sighting system and 

00:07:16.570 --> 00:07:22.180
 respectively the vision of anti-tank 

00:07:19.190 --> 00:07:24.860
 showing rocket ceiling will break 

00:07:22.180 --> 00:07:27.380
 Israeli gunsmiths assure if 

00:07:24.860 --> 00:07:29.599
 the smoke screen will dissipate and so suddenly not 

00:07:27.380 --> 00:07:31.820
 have time to retreat complex active 

00:07:29.599 --> 00:07:34.460
 trophy protection will ensure it 

00:07:31.820 --> 00:07:36.710
 security until you arrive 

00:07:34.460 --> 00:07:38.690
 reinforcement after all merkava with 

00:07:36.710 --> 00:07:40.680
 installed on her complex active 

00:07:38.690 --> 00:07:45.680
 protection able not 

00:07:40.680 --> 00:07:45.680
 backwater up to 6 flying missiles at the same time
