00:00:00.929 --> 00:00:02.240
 I have a question 

00:00:02.240 --> 00:00:04.570
 of Patricia was the painters 

00:00:04.570 --> 00:00:07.580
 between the scale to belkin models 

00:00:07.580 --> 00:00:09.920
 And so it is also a chance in a fat requirement setting 

00:00:09.920 --> 00:00:11.389
 the incident became 

00:00:11.389 --> 00:00:13.119
 now is a prophet 

00:00:13.119 --> 00:00:15.219
 and he got his 

00:00:15.219 --> 00:00:16.429
 all three 

00:00:16.429 --> 00:00:19.499
 in all colors to the city the difference has more 

00:00:19.499 --> 00:00:20.470
 the next 

00:00:20.470 --> 00:00:22.499
 make a big difference with you 

00:00:22.499 --> 00:00:27.160
 nexans keep lions out of the package then let me just a moment and what peels 

00:00:27.159 --> 00:00:28.970
 all jokes are unpacked 

00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:31.970
 the eso observatory records improved 

00:00:33.250 --> 00:00:37.610
 well i have seven drops from the package and we clarity this is a strong one 

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:38.480
 sit 

00:00:38.480 --> 00:00:39.950
 became the sprint 

00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:41.360
 provided the prophet 

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:44.060
 all of them are leaders 

00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:45.190
 emmen 

00:00:45.190 --> 00:00:47.739
 is therefore mainly due to the accident 

00:00:47.739 --> 00:00:49.510
 because that's just the difference 

00:00:49.510 --> 00:00:51.290
 passover to fall 

00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:54.100
 all three in about the same phone 

00:00:54.100 --> 00:00:56.079
 and i had cpnb 

00:00:56.079 --> 00:00:57.940
 the sisters who is fit 

00:00:57.940 --> 00:01:00.640
 as a model 

00:01:00.640 --> 00:01:04.390
 yes fairly normal should be there and no key box 

00:01:05.160 --> 00:01:07.310
 it's not about them in any of the three hours 

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:08.630
 sport than men 

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:11.650
 why customers do, I don't really know how easy it is 

00:01:11.650 --> 00:01:12.770
 such small boxes 

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:15.880
 or for a little scheltens a note 

00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:18.440
 from safely so from ten fines 

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:21.730
 or a locksmith the spa cannot do all three models 

00:01:21.730 --> 00:01:24.530
 and 

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:27.730
 she is probably a competition 

00:01:27.730 --> 00:01:30.540
 just dry the gardener back 

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:31.550
 for japan 

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:33.150
 had walked a herd 

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:35.900
 President electoral law just a beautiful model 

00:01:35.900 --> 00:01:36.700
 and 

00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:38.580
 so I think this is this one 

00:01:38.580 --> 00:01:41.790
 but this is a bit more colored further on is the first game 

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:44.850
 the connection here that it is here with these houses 

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:48.150
 there is also one 

00:01:48.150 --> 00:01:50.590
 a small drilling 

00:01:50.590 --> 00:01:52.560
 and to settle there 

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:56.179
 ruurlo yes i was showing if you negotiated this 

00:01:58.640 --> 00:02:01.410
 walk down 

00:02:01.410 --> 00:02:04.590
 and with this you can take another few extra boats 

00:02:08.499 --> 00:02:10.839
 that will be really easy going 

00:02:10.839 --> 00:02:13.349
 with is precisely the intention probably makes 

00:02:13.349 --> 00:02:15.689
 so they can aim for the arm 

00:02:15.689 --> 00:02:17.880
 in addition, the beautiful on board have been covered 

00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:21.159
 sat there even less so that it rainwater 

00:02:21.159 --> 00:02:24.839
 in sports, the rotten time escapes suddenly at a time when you 

00:02:24.839 --> 00:02:27.799
 a fast-paced run per home 

00:02:27.799 --> 00:02:29.989
 And this is the slim fit 

00:02:29.989 --> 00:02:32.689
 and this model also the choice to your arm clamps 

00:02:32.689 --> 00:02:37.669
 and here you can stand in this degree that in itself is nice 

00:02:39.459 --> 00:02:41.709
 this prophet you 

00:02:41.709 --> 00:02:42.719
 Yes it is 

00:02:42.719 --> 00:02:44.819
 is just very nicely finished of course 

00:02:44.819 --> 00:02:46.969
 the murder of the battle ing 

00:02:46.969 --> 00:02:51.019
 so that makes it nicer not so much that you are more aiming we are 

00:02:51.019 --> 00:02:52.469
 is going to walk in 

00:02:52.469 --> 00:02:56.019
 so that saves a lot so also to keep such a small fab under water 

00:02:56.629 --> 00:02:58.649
 this connection is therefore beautiful 

00:02:58.649 --> 00:03:00.690
 and yes actually know that 

00:03:00.690 --> 00:03:02.769
 as follows 

00:03:02.769 --> 00:03:04.769
 both times open 

00:03:04.769 --> 00:03:06.719
 so you set the tone for more arnhem 

00:03:06.719 --> 00:03:08.789
 and if you're on your tail street 

00:03:08.789 --> 00:03:10.649
 do not click close 

00:03:10.649 --> 00:03:13.649
 And then it is exactly always right or not that 

00:03:14.379 --> 00:03:17.599
 are against that aspens through the open space at home with that band 

00:03:18.129 --> 00:03:20.409
 being rejected as a contractor is normal 

00:03:20.409 --> 00:03:22.199
 to open 

00:03:22.199 --> 00:03:25.319
 and then it is always tailor-made around your arm 

00:03:26.149 --> 00:03:29.149
 and of course you can and then you do that 

00:03:29.859 --> 00:03:31.369
 view here 

00:03:31.369 --> 00:03:34.449
 with this it returns 

00:03:34.449 --> 00:03:37.449
 make small or more spacious 

00:03:38.049 --> 00:03:39.979
 in this way 

00:03:39.979 --> 00:03:42.529
 and yes the clip differently 

00:03:42.529 --> 00:03:44.409
 around your arm 

00:03:44.409 --> 00:03:46.469
 the voice can always be better 

00:03:46.469 --> 00:03:48.209
 I do not actually know 

00:03:48.209 --> 00:03:49.550
 it is one 

00:03:49.550 --> 00:03:51.569
 Sure hard plastic thing 

00:03:51.569 --> 00:03:54.049
 and I like to walk that considerable distances 

00:03:54.049 --> 00:03:57.179
 we spoke we offered 20 kilometers 

00:03:57.179 --> 00:04:01.759
 and then yes nicholson man that it can be a little side but it is whole 

00:04:01.759 --> 00:04:03.139
 in person 

00:04:03.139 --> 00:04:04.559
 so always silent 

00:04:04.559 --> 00:04:06.049
 between it failed 

00:04:06.049 --> 00:04:07.089
 became the sprint 

00:04:07.089 --> 00:04:08.619
 and the prophet 

00:04:08.619 --> 00:04:12.479
 mail from the home countries, of course, he only has just under four times 

00:04:12.479 --> 00:04:13.019
 be put down
