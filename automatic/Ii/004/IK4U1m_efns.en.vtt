00:00:00.199 --> 00:00:04.740
 It was a great career 

00:00:03.570 --> 00:00:06.930
 Michael Ballack with his 

00:00:04.740 --> 00:00:10.469
 Farewell game in Leipzig ends the 

00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:13.080
 capitano says I have a great one 

00:00:10.469 --> 00:00:14.759
 farewell and from football with 

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:15.570
 a game and also has during 

00:00:14.759 --> 00:00:17.220
 my career 

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:19.260
 great moments and many happy times 

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:20.760
 and football are just like that 

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:22.710
 difficult times the normal as 

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:24.630
 in normal life too many 

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:26.460
 Companions have extra holidays 

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:27.599
 moved one last time with the 

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:29.269
 former captain of 

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:33.390
 national team to play together 

00:00:29.269 --> 00:00:34.500
 opportunity to say goodbye bye 

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:36.450
 had simply delighted that so many 

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:39.580
 not only spectators came, too 

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:41.930
 player of course because I know how 

00:00:39.580 --> 00:00:43.760
 like that is after a season after a 

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:46.040
 hard season , many unite 

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:47.150
 play in bone short holiday only and 

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:49.040
 then maybe another one or to the 

00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:50.390
 other event must be in quotes 

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:51.470
 or invited then too too 

00:00:50.390 --> 00:00:53.540
 say and not come 

00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:57.170
 of course and that imagines 

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:59.620
 he was very proud of being a footballer 

00:00:57.170 --> 00:01:01.730
 present as well as as human as well as 

00:00:59.620 --> 00:01:02.900
 we occurred as well as one 

00:01:01.730 --> 00:01:05.270
 team has done that was something 

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:06.350
 very special and has the boys 

00:01:05.270 --> 00:01:08.540
 Of course they are very influenced 

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:11.150
 Of course you have such a place somewhere 

00:01:08.540 --> 00:01:13.100
 common common origin from the 

00:01:11.150 --> 00:01:15.440
 former German Democratic Republic and that the 

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:16.610
 welding education where together and although so 

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:19.040
 a few years 

00:01:16.610 --> 00:01:21.530
 Separate age difference have relative 

00:01:19.040 --> 00:01:23.600
 Well located on a wavelength and 

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:24.140
 that's why it was clearly here for me 

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:28.460
 to be 

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:30.560
 in character top what he says 

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:34.940
 that's not a big mouth is really times 

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:37.000
 there when you need it and I know 

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:40.700
 always to play an honor with him 

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:43.310
 sporting ambition and I believe has 

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:45.619
 he always tries to give everything he has 

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:49.869
 team was always motivated a 

00:01:45.619 --> 00:01:51.800
 big captain human of course 

00:01:49.869 --> 00:01:53.659
 many say they have a bit 

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:55.670
 had a difficult character but to 

00:01:53.659 --> 00:01:56.630
 luck, you have to have a big one 

00:01:55.670 --> 00:01:59.119
 football nations 

00:01:56.630 --> 00:02:00.740
 It was a wonderful time for the 

00:01:59.119 --> 00:02:03.350
 I'm very thankful ballack says 

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:05.800
 squeezed a tear and finished his 

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:05.800
 world career
