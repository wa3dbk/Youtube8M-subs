because you see with one trailer the
in-depth<00:05:16.920> analysis<00:05:17.340> i<00:05:17.430> did<00:05:17.580> with<00:05:17.640> that

00:05:17.690 --> 00:05:17.700 
in-depth analysis i did with that

00:05:17.700 --> 00:05:19.790 
in-depth analysis i did with that
trailer<00:05:18.000> how<00:05:18.450> much<00:05:18.660> came<00:05:18.960> out<00:05:19.170> of<00:05:19.320> that<00:05:19.350> where

00:05:19.790 --> 00:05:19.800 
trailer how much came out of that where

00:05:19.800 --> 00:05:21.170 
trailer how much came out of that where
i<00:05:19.830> was<00:05:20.010> still<00:05:20.250> talking<00:05:20.610> about<00:05:20.670> stuff<00:05:20.940> in<00:05:21.150> that

00:05:21.170 --> 00:05:21.180 
i was still talking about stuff in that

00:05:21.180 --> 00:05:24.350 
i was still talking about stuff in that
trailer<00:05:21.570> for<00:05:22.290> months<00:05:22.830> to<00:05:22.980> come<00:05:23.010> i<00:05:23.460> think<00:05:24.060> one

00:05:24.350 --> 00:05:24.360 
trailer for months to come i think one

00:05:24.360 --> 00:05:26.210 
trailer for months to come i think one
more<00:05:24.510> trailer<00:05:24.900> for<00:05:25.050> that<00:05:25.200> would<00:05:25.740> really<00:05:26.040> do

00:05:26.210 --> 00:05:26.220 
more trailer for that would really do

00:05:26.220 --> 00:05:27.770 
more trailer for that would really do
the<00:05:26.370> trick<00:05:26.400> but<00:05:26.820> that's<00:05:27.180> just<00:05:27.330> my<00:05:27.480> honest

00:05:27.770 --> 00:05:27.780 
the trick but that's just my honest

00:05:27.780 --> 00:05:29.420 
the trick but that's just my honest
opinion<00:05:28.170> I<00:05:28.290> felt<00:05:28.560> like<00:05:28.650> this<00:05:28.710> was<00:05:28.830> a<00:05:28.980> topic<00:05:29.220> I

00:05:29.420 --> 00:05:29.430 
opinion I felt like this was a topic I

00:05:29.430 --> 00:05:31.040 
opinion I felt like this was a topic I
really<00:05:29.640> needed<00:05:29.850> to<00:05:29.970> talk<00:05:30.060> about<00:05:30.390> because<00:05:30.660> I

00:05:31.040 --> 00:05:31.050 
really needed to talk about because I

00:05:31.050 --> 00:05:32.630 
really needed to talk about because I
