00:00:08.510 --> 00:00:12.780
 almost a year has passed since its release 

00:00:10.679 --> 00:00:14.730
 on the old consoles and today thanks to 

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:16.500
 these definitive shauns are ready 

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:18.390
 to dress again as lara su 

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:20.460
 playstation 4 and xbox one 

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:21.539
 crystal dynamics guys have 

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:25.470
 made some small improvements 

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:27.300
 we find in this video review the 

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:29.250
 inexperienced young lara has embarked 

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:31.380
 on endurance in search of the mythical 

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:33.149
 yamatai realm is a long journey and 

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:34.800
 dangerous that will make it mature e 

00:00:33.149 --> 00:00:37.190
 become the explorer that everyone 

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:37.190
 we know 

00:00:44.630 --> 00:00:49.350
 a real reboot then a tomb 

00:00:47.580 --> 00:00:50.940
 raider that makes us experience all the traumas 

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:52.920
 psychological physicists than the young 

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:54.930
 archaeologist is found to support and that 

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:57.000
 shows us with extreme hardness a 

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:59.190
 harder and darker context than the 

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:02.000
 past adventures a whole adventure 

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:02.000
 new in short 

00:01:05.520 --> 00:01:10.030
 Tomb Raider is in effect a 

00:01:08.110 --> 00:01:12.790
 reboot and this means changing the 

00:01:10.030 --> 00:01:14.890
 cards on the table a lot too and to do it 

00:01:12.790 --> 00:01:17.110
 he had to fish from a full hand 

00:01:14.890 --> 00:01:18.610
 game that paradoxically has been breathed 

00:01:17.110 --> 00:01:20.050
 right at the very first adventures of 

00:01:18.610 --> 00:01:23.880
 lara uncharted 

00:01:20.050 --> 00:01:23.880
 the result is definitely good 

00:01:25.659 --> 00:01:29.310
 will work 

00:01:27.409 --> 00:01:31.530
 I need matri 

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:33.479
 the gameplay is therefore more similar to that 

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:35.399
 some naughty dog ​​jobs with rhythm 

00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:37.200
 regularity shootings sequences of 

00:01:35.399 --> 00:01:38.880
 climbing crowning it all with a 

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:39.600
 great cinematic approach 

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:41.430
 impact 

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:43.409
 a more effective gameplay though 

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:45.060
 more homologated going to sacrifice a 

00:01:43.409 --> 00:01:45.750
 both exploration and puzzles 

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:47.880
 environmental 

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:49.350
 but what differentiates this version from 

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:51.149
 those of the past generation of 

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:53.220
 console in addition to the obvious event in 

00:01:51.149 --> 00:01:55.470
 graph it is possible to issue commands 

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:57.539
 vowels to call up I envy the map 

00:01:55.470 --> 00:01:59.460
 to be able to consult it or 

00:01:57.539 --> 00:02:01.409
 intervene on weapons to verify 

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:03.270
 those supplied or to decide 

00:02:01.409 --> 00:02:05.940
 possibly to change the one in use 

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:08.009
 with your own voice on playstation 4 then 

00:02:05.940 --> 00:02:09.690
 there are some little goodies nothing of 

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:11.970
 exceptional but nevertheless synonymous with a 

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:13.860
 pinch of extra attention when lara 

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:15.420
 performs certain actions on the screen 

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:17.760
 how to light a torch a fire 

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:19.410
 shoot the joypad light shines of 

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:21.569
 orange red as to simulate the 

00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:23.730
 flashes or flashes white at each 

00:02:21.569 --> 00:02:25.560
 derma blow through then the speaker 

00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:27.750
 positioned on the front of the 

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:29.220
 dualshock 4 you can listen to some 

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:31.290
 of environmental noises produced 

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:33.390
 exploring certain areas of the island 

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:35.010
 the definitive edition of tomb raider 

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:37.019
 also includes all the different so far 

00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:39.180
 released for the game it comes to 

00:02:37.019 --> 00:02:40.890
 additional outline contents for the 

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:42.570
 multiplayer there are for example some 

00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:44.250
 new maps or some characters from 

00:02:42.570 --> 00:02:46.579
 deploy in solar factions o 

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:49.109
 survivors plus the agent's weapons 47 

00:02:46.579 --> 00:02:50.700
 littman up solutions while for the 

00:02:49.109 --> 00:02:53.040
 there are single player modes 

00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:57.079
 clothes weapons extra items for more lara 

00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:57.079
 a new secret tomb to explore 

00:03:00.410 --> 00:03:05.730
 but what changes beyond the resolution 

00:03:02.960 --> 00:03:08.070
 crystal dynamics has gone to retouch 

00:03:05.730 --> 00:03:10.230
 many other small things to donate a 

00:03:08.070 --> 00:03:12.920
 new freshness to the excellent work already 

00:03:10.230 --> 00:03:12.920
 done previously 

00:03:20.930 --> 00:03:25.290
 compared to the original edition we have 

00:03:23.580 --> 00:03:26.849
 greater depth in the image e 

00:03:25.290 --> 00:03:29.040
 especially looking at the horizon 

00:03:26.849 --> 00:03:30.840
 thanks to the native resolution of 1080p 

00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:33.000
 which goes to heavily affect the 

00:03:30.840 --> 00:03:34.680
 definition and detail of the game is 

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:36.870
 a series of excellent particle effects 

00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:39.450
 of dynamic light that embellish 

00:03:36.870 --> 00:03:41.459
 characters and environments and return a 

00:03:39.450 --> 00:03:43.110
 world even more likely everything 

00:03:41.459 --> 00:03:45.120
 helps make scenarios alive 

00:03:43.110 --> 00:03:47.040
 and is managed by the body in the game with 

00:03:45.120 --> 00:03:49.110
 a certain fluidity guaranteed on 

00:03:47.040 --> 00:03:51.420
 playstation 4 and well not always great 

00:03:49.110 --> 00:03:53.400
 says 60 frames per second and from 

00:03:51.420 --> 00:03:55.920
 thirty frames on xbox one 

00:03:53.400 --> 00:03:57.209
 the end result of this sort of 

00:03:55.920 --> 00:03:59.549
 in short, restyling is a world 

00:03:57.209 --> 00:04:01.200
 cinematic that takes life both 

00:03:59.549 --> 00:04:03.209
 clear we are not faced with 

00:04:01.200 --> 00:04:05.310
 something shocking or never seen 

00:04:03.209 --> 00:04:06.630
 certainly the title does not give the feeling of 

00:04:05.310 --> 00:04:09.180
 play a product of one 

00:04:06.630 --> 00:04:11.220
 generation passed a note apart from the 

00:04:09.180 --> 00:04:12.780
 deserves lara croft that inevitably has 

00:04:11.220 --> 00:04:14.760
 received the most attention from 

00:04:12.780 --> 00:04:16.650
 of the charts if the polygonal model 

00:04:14.760 --> 00:04:18.690
 of the beautiful archaeologist appears even more 

00:04:16.650 --> 00:04:20.430
 refined and pleasant and well proportioned 

00:04:18.690 --> 00:04:22.710
 and enhanced by the presence of effects 

00:04:20.430 --> 00:04:24.630
 such as sweat on the skin the mud that 

00:04:22.710 --> 00:04:26.130
 it makes her face dirty and natural 

00:04:24.630 --> 00:04:28.560
 hair movement thanks to 

00:04:26.130 --> 00:04:31.140
 3 fx different technology is the speech 

00:04:28.560 --> 00:04:32.910
 for the conformation of his face 

00:04:31.140 --> 00:04:34.320
 face is undoubtedly more realistic but 

00:04:32.910 --> 00:04:36.419
 also different than that 

00:04:34.320 --> 00:04:37.919
 original closure is mature thing that 

00:04:36.419 --> 00:04:39.210
 jars a bit with the character of the 

00:04:37.919 --> 00:04:41.479
 young and frightened struggling for 

00:04:39.210 --> 00:04:41.479
 to survive 

00:04:55.220 --> 00:05:01.100
 well now it puts you back on your mind 

00:04:59.510 --> 00:05:03.260
 well structured and emotionally 

00:05:01.100 --> 00:05:05.120
 as engaging as few other titles 

00:05:03.260 --> 00:05:07.400
 of the past generation of consoles 

00:05:05.120 --> 00:05:09.560
 tomb raider confirms to be excellent also in the 

00:05:07.400 --> 00:05:11.750
 his passage on the new console and the 

00:05:09.560 --> 00:05:13.760
 term technicians and edition goes well 

00:05:11.750 --> 00:05:15.740
 with this version of the game 

00:05:13.760 --> 00:05:17.570
 the product is indeed the edition 

00:05:15.740 --> 00:05:19.760
 final and qualitatively better than 

00:05:17.570 --> 00:05:21.560
 reboot of the adventures of lara croft that 

00:05:19.760 --> 00:05:23.870
 it looks good on the new Sony flagships 

00:05:21.560 --> 00:05:26.270
 and microsoft 

00:05:23.870 --> 00:05:32.770
 the mine come out right away 

00:05:26.270 --> 00:05:32.770
 then i 'm fashion dude 

00:05:39.510 --> 00:05:43.300
 greider had liked it enough already 

00:05:41.860 --> 00:05:45.190
 time of its release is obviously 

00:05:43.300 --> 00:05:46.180
 this definitive of shock cannot 

00:05:45.190 --> 00:05:48.250
 be outdone 

00:05:46.180 --> 00:05:50.500
 there is a new graphic the ten are all 

00:05:48.250 --> 00:05:52.510
 included but still a few small ones 

00:05:50.500 --> 00:05:53.650
 structural deficit like intelligence 

00:05:52.510 --> 00:05:56.620
 artificial of the enemies 

00:05:53.650 --> 00:05:58.540
 basically it's a good game but the 

00:05:56.620 --> 00:06:01.530
 price may not justify 

00:05:58.540 --> 00:06:01.530
 purchase to old owners 

00:06:23.410 --> 00:06:31.880
 malara on playstation 4 and xbox one few 

00:06:27.740 --> 00:06:33.560
 and this is shaun's definitive 

00:06:31.880 --> 00:06:36.980
 ready to dress again as 

00:06:33.560 --> 00:06:38.840
 lara souplesse and tosca plans incredible 

00:06:36.980 --> 00:06:40.490
 well it is the urge that has embarked on the 

00:06:38.840 --> 00:06:42.350
 endurance in search of the realm 

00:06:40.490 --> 00:06:45.470
 enchanted if we were enchanting though 

00:06:42.350 --> 00:06:47.600
 long and dangerous snow white that 

00:06:45.470 --> 00:06:50.390
 will mature and become the explorer 

00:06:47.600 --> 00:06:53.660
 that we all know about regression 

00:06:50.390 --> 00:06:56.000
 the explorer is a long journey and 

00:06:53.660 --> 00:07:01.360
 dangerous that will make it mature e 

00:06:56.000 --> 00:07:01.360
 to become four that barked
