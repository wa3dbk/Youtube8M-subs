00:01:13.660 --> 00:01:15.150
 recovered 

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:17.140
 and of course that fits in particularly well now 

00:01:17.140 --> 00:01:20.140
 that this urban people could be beggars 

00:01:20.760 --> 00:01:22.050

 that at first he would have even distributed sleeping bags to homeless people 

00:01:32.260 --> 00:01:37.170
 He has a personal experience in the winter of 1993 

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:40.700

 there is a woman here in the old town percent out 

00:01:46.750 --> 00:01:50.180
 Two people are shaking each other Frau Holle I had thought 

00:01:50.180 --> 00:01:53.810
 you can at least here in the district so far driven that one 

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:57.560
 the sleeping bags and mattresses exercised so that no longer all carers 

00:01:57.560 --> 00:02:00.560
 At least every one of them does not want an offense 

00:02:03.190 --> 00:02:06.140
 like the poor kitchen in the Düsseldorf city hall 

00:02:06.140 --> 00:02:10.590

 even though he now has 5 million euros to play together, it is 

00:02:26.829 --> 00:02:28.929
 not done with money alone 

00:02:28.929 --> 00:02:32.789
 Dealing with the downed is for the musician ambassadors 

00:02:32.789 --> 00:02:38.599
 against the increasing social cold also an indicator of the condition of ours 

00:02:38.599 --> 00:02:41.599
 society 

00:02:43.269 --> 00:02:44.959
 on the other hand 

00:02:44.959 --> 00:02:46.579
 But it is also about it 

00:02:46.579 --> 00:02:47.769
 the 

00:02:47.769 --> 00:02:51.249
 Awareness in the public is aroused 

00:02:51.249 --> 00:02:55.359
 that is in times of economic difficulties that we now have now 

00:02:55.359 --> 00:02:57.419
 the niece can go around it 

00:02:57.419 --> 00:03:01.239
 that the weak will be denied the few rights they have left 

00:03:01.239 --> 00:03:04.129
 and the strong ones no longer their duties 

00:03:04.129 --> 00:03:06.060
 and that is the successful one 

00:03:06.060 --> 00:03:08.819
 Percent is also the good person at the same time 

00:03:08.819 --> 00:03:09.989
 and percent 

00:03:09.989 --> 00:03:11.859
 the percent of healthy 

00:03:11.859 --> 00:03:13.149
 and percentages 

00:03:13.149 --> 00:03:17.839
 financially strong and at the same time the just is so it is not too 

00:03:17.839 --> 00:03:21.989
 Percent also have the percent of people who leave their emotional powers 

00:03:21.989 --> 00:03:23.209
 to have 

00:03:23.209 --> 00:03:27.149
 JPA or even those who have no money are entitled to it 

00:03:28.359 --> 00:03:29.620
 with the World League 

00:03:29.620 --> 00:03:33.950
 to be treated too late for each individual according to the Basic Law 

00:03:33.950 --> 00:03:36.670
 and that is a bit nice here and so far is nice 

00:03:36.670 --> 00:03:39.670
 I like to give my concerts 

00:03:40.639 --> 00:03:44.499
 his compassion for his commitment to the homeless 

00:03:44.499 --> 00:03:48.489
 also has deeper reasons in the person of the freelance artist 

00:03:50.139 --> 00:03:54.499
 Solidarity with those who get out of whack and go awry 

00:03:54.499 --> 00:03:55.799
 became 

00:03:55.799 --> 00:03:57.889
 does not come by chance 

00:03:57.889 --> 00:03:58.899
 I think 

00:03:58.899 --> 00:04:01.899
 good artists always draws a special sensitivity 

00:04:03.109 --> 00:04:04.199
 and that one too 

00:04:04.199 --> 00:04:07.999
 think because without thinking there is never in the artistic process 

00:04:07.999 --> 00:04:09.119
 continue 

00:04:09.119 --> 00:04:13.599
 As a teenager, I already have many homeless people in the Düsseldorf 

00:04:13.599 --> 00:04:17.219
 See old town sitting on the street and always the idea came to me 

00:04:18.629 --> 00:04:21.629
 I could sit there myself and who helps children 

00:04:24.020 --> 00:04:27.340
 So if you think about it, my wife is having a hard time after the car accident 

00:04:27.340 --> 00:04:29.490
 falls ill after her last tour 

00:04:29.490 --> 00:04:32.779
 just as a freelancer and as a freelance artist 

00:04:32.779 --> 00:04:35.779
 but also as a guest and lawyer it can meet anyone 

00:04:36.289 --> 00:04:39.870
 the price of each of the fates of homeless people once 

00:04:40.430 --> 00:04:41.529
 practice 

00:04:41.529 --> 00:04:44.529
 studied 

00:05:04.379 --> 00:05:06.589
 for the artists Tomas Gegnern 

00:05:06.589 --> 00:05:09.909
 is his social engagement a possibility 

00:05:09.909 --> 00:05:12.080
 the ivory tower of the music 

00:05:12.080 --> 00:05:15.080
 to swap with the reality of everyday life 

00:05:18.849 --> 00:05:20.789
 it has been a goal at the moment 

00:05:20.789 --> 00:05:23.789
 to put the music in a social context 

00:05:24.439 --> 00:05:27.189
 especially because the musicians in public 

00:05:27.189 --> 00:05:29.289
 takes place and because of the concerts 

00:05:29.289 --> 00:05:31.759
 in which emotions are generated 

00:05:31.759 --> 00:05:35.590
 and people also develop and serve a sympathy for the musicians 

00:05:35.589 --> 00:05:39.120
 Musicians have to make sure that they do not idolize themselves as stars 

00:05:39.119 --> 00:05:43.300
 but that they trigger social processes with 

00:05:43.300 --> 00:05:47.240
 All are goodwill and percent that is just important at a time 

00:05:47.240 --> 00:05:51.050
 Percent of the economic imbalance where ever greater fears 

00:05:51.050 --> 00:05:55.360
 and percent on the part of the business leaders really brazen 

00:05:55.360 --> 00:05:59.819
 Percent claims that the goal of corporate governance is in the stock 

00:05:59.819 --> 00:06:01.719
 enter the goal 

00:06:01.719 --> 00:06:05.330
 It always has to be a company to get the jobs and each one of them 

00:06:05.329 --> 00:06:07.450
 Company is only there for the people 

00:06:07.450 --> 00:06:12.460
 those who have in him life and their use of him and is in this sense 

00:06:12.460 --> 00:06:13.880
 together against cold 

00:06:13.880 --> 00:06:18.319
