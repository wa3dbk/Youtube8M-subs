00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:35.370 
than a headset on this definitely is so

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:37.819 
than a headset on this definitely is so
much<00:00:35.579> more<00:00:35.610> clear<00:00:36.149> I<00:00:36.480> did<00:00:37.050> not<00:00:37.170> order<00:00:37.200> a<00:00:37.469> pop

00:00:37.819 --> 00:00:37.829 
much more clear I did not order a pop

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:39.440 
much more clear I did not order a pop
filter<00:00:38.100> just<00:00:38.489> because<00:00:38.820> i<00:00:38.969> didn't<00:00:39.210> think<00:00:39.239> i

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:39.450 
filter just because i didn't think i

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:40.910 
filter just because i didn't think i
would<00:00:39.510> need<00:00:39.840> one<00:00:40.110> if<00:00:40.260> you<00:00:40.379> guys<00:00:40.500> don't<00:00:40.680> know<00:00:40.890> a

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:40.920 
would need one if you guys don't know a

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:42.410 
would need one if you guys don't know a
pop<00:00:41.190> filter<00:00:41.370> is<00:00:41.670> kind<00:00:41.879> of<00:00:41.940> used<00:00:42.090> to<00:00:42.149> make<00:00:42.300> the

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:42.420 
pop filter is kind of used to make the

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:45.260 
pop filter is kind of used to make the
audio<00:00:42.750> more<00:00:43.020> clear<00:00:43.710> and<00:00:43.940> sometimes<00:00:44.940> you<00:00:45.180> know

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:45.270 
audio more clear and sometimes you know

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:46.850 
audio more clear and sometimes you know
you<00:00:45.329> get<00:00:45.570> these<00:00:45.690> popping<00:00:46.260> sounds<00:00:46.680> when<00:00:46.770> you

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:46.860 
you get these popping sounds when you

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:48.500 
you get these popping sounds when you
pronounce<00:00:47.039> your<00:00:47.340> peas<00:00:47.670> or<00:00:47.910> certain<00:00:48.210> letters

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:48.510 
pronounce your peas or certain letters

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:50.900 
pronounce your peas or certain letters
and<00:00:48.770> the<00:00:49.770> pop<00:00:50.010> filter<00:00:50.160> kind<00:00:50.489> of<00:00:50.550> gets<00:00:50.670> rid<00:00:50.879> of

00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:50.910 
and the pop filter kind of gets rid of

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:53.119 
and the pop filter kind of gets rid of
that<00:00:51.180> but<00:00:51.629> if<00:00:51.870> you<00:00:52.079> guys<00:00:52.440> think<00:00:52.469> that<00:00:52.980> i<00:00:53.010> should

00:00:53.119 --> 00:00:53.129
