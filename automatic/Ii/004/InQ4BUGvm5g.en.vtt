00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:42.990 
got to say something I have noticed

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:44.600 
got to say something I have noticed
inside<00:01:43.229> of<00:01:43.320> the<00:01:43.409> music<00:01:43.710> player<00:01:43.920> is<00:01:44.159> if<00:01:44.520> you

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:44.610 
inside of the music player is if you

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:46.460 
inside of the music player is if you
have<00:01:44.790> a<00:01:44.820> ton<00:01:45.180> of<00:01:45.210> music<00:01:45.479> like<00:01:45.810> me<00:01:46.049> I<00:01:46.079> have<00:01:46.170> to

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:46.470 
have a ton of music like me I have to

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:49.490 
have a ton of music like me I have to
have<00:01:46.710> like<00:01:46.860> 1500<00:01:47.790> songs<00:01:48.409> somewhere<00:01:49.409> around

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:49.500 
have like 1500 songs somewhere around

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:52.010 
have like 1500 songs somewhere around
there<00:01:49.799> then<00:01:50.220> you'll<00:01:50.909> notice<00:01:51.119> that<00:01:51.450> scrolling

00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:52.020 
there then you'll notice that scrolling

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:53.899 
there then you'll notice that scrolling
through<00:01:52.170> them<00:01:52.350> is<00:01:52.560> much<00:01:53.009> better<00:01:53.220> there's<00:01:53.520> less

00:01:53.899 --> 00:01:53.909 
through them is much better there's less

00:01:53.909 --> 00:01:56.420 
through them is much better there's less
lag<00:01:54.299> on<00:01:54.720> my<00:01:54.869> other<00:01:54.960> 6<00:01:55.290> plus<00:01:55.500> and<00:01:55.680> I<00:01:55.740> was<00:01:55.920> 8.3

00:01:56.420 --> 00:01:56.430 
lag on my other 6 plus and I was 8.3

00:01:56.430 --> 00:01:57.649 
lag on my other 6 plus and I was 8.3
I've<00:01:56.520> noticed<00:01:56.790> that<00:01:57.090> when<00:01:57.240> I<00:01:57.299> scroll<00:01:57.600> through

00:01:57.649 --> 00:01:57.659 
I've noticed that when I scroll through

00:01:57.659 --> 00:01:59.389 
I've noticed that when I scroll through
them<00:01:57.960> there's<00:01:58.140> a<00:01:58.200> lot<00:01:58.320> of<00:01:58.439> stutter<00:01:58.890> whereas<00:01:59.280> in

00:01:59.389 --> 00:01:59.399 
them there's a lot of stutter whereas in

00:01:59.399 --> 00:02:01.760 
them there's a lot of stutter whereas in
8.4<00:01:59.820> Apple<00:02:00.600> has<00:02:00.750> certainly<00:02:01.049> remedied<00:02:01.590> that

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:01.770 
8.4 Apple has certainly remedied that

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:03.260 
8.4 Apple has certainly remedied that
especially<00:02:02.310> if<00:02:02.399> you<00:02:02.520> have<00:02:02.670> a<00:02:02.700> huge<00:02:03.000> library

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:03.270 
especially if you have a huge library

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:05.420 
especially if you have a huge library
like<00:02:03.750> me<00:02:03.960> so<00:02:04.469> performance<00:02:04.920> is<00:02:05.040> a<00:02:05.070> little<00:02:05.310> bit

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:05.430 
like me so performance is a little bit

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:07.459 
like me so performance is a little bit
better<00:02:05.610> but<00:02:06.000> more<00:02:06.149> than<00:02:06.329> that<00:02:06.390> the<00:02:07.020> looks<00:02:07.259> have

00:02:07.459 --> 00:02:07.469 
better but more than that the looks have

00:02:07.469 --> 00:02:09.770 
better but more than that the looks have
changed<00:02:07.979> it<00:02:08.160> looks<00:02:08.369> gorgeous<00:02:08.670> so<00:02:09.179> this<00:02:09.569> is

00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:09.780 
changed it looks gorgeous so this is

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:11.449 
changed it looks gorgeous so this is

so in there you can see all the new
music<00:02:19.889> basically<00:02:20.099> I'd<00:02:20.579> say<00:02:20.790> that<00:02:20.939> Apple<00:02:21.239> has

00:02:21.349 --> 00:02:21.359 
music basically I'd say that Apple has

00:02:21.359 --> 00:02:23.300 
music basically I'd say that Apple has
simplified<00:02:21.900> the<00:02:22.019> music<00:02:22.319> application<00:02:22.499> so

00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:23.310 
simplified the music application so

00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:25.160 
simplified the music application so
instead<00:02:23.609> of<00:02:23.670> having<00:02:23.879> five<00:02:24.239> categories<00:02:24.900> things

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:25.170 
instead of having five categories things

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:25.879 
instead of having five categories things
all<00:02:25.349> over<00:02:25.379> the<00:02:25.620> place

00:02:25.879 --> 00:02:25.889 
all over the place

00:02:25.889 --> 00:02:27.470 
all over the place
Apple<00:02:26.519> has<00:02:26.670> put<00:02:26.849> them<00:02:26.999> into<00:02:27.150> three<00:02:27.450> categories

00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:27.480 
Apple has put them into three categories

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:29.869 
Apple has put them into three categories
and<00:02:28.109> made<00:02:28.469> it<00:02:28.590> a<00:02:28.650> little<00:02:28.920> bit<00:02:29.099> more<00:02:29.189> simple<00:02:29.489> now

00:02:29.869 --> 00:02:29.879 
and made it a little bit more simple now

00:02:29.879 --> 00:02:31.039 
and made it a little bit more simple now
you<00:02:29.939> have<00:02:30.150> these<00:02:30.299> little<00:02:30.450> guys<00:02:30.689> right<00:02:30.719> here
