in<00:01:02.300> the<00:01:02.359> last<00:01:02.510> week<00:01:03.370> you<00:01:04.480> know<00:01:05.480> but<00:01:05.840> anyway<00:01:06.170> I'm

00:01:06.550 --> 00:01:06.560 
in the last week you know but anyway I'm

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:09.100 
in the last week you know but anyway I'm
afraid<00:01:06.710> this<00:01:07.010> is<00:01:07.100> what<00:01:07.250> we<00:01:07.370> have<00:01:07.520> to<00:01:07.640> do<00:01:08.110> to

00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:09.110 
afraid this is what we have to do to

00:01:09.110 --> 00:01:10.660 
afraid this is what we have to do to
save<00:01:09.500> our<00:01:09.710> honour<00:01:09.740> because<00:01:10.430> we<00:01:10.550> honestly

00:01:16.090 --> 00:01:16.100 
setting of rhino horn which is what we

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:19.090 
setting of rhino horn which is what we
fighting<00:01:16.460> for<00:01:16.490> at<00:01:16.700> the<00:01:16.790> moment<00:01:17.710> it<00:01:18.710> will<00:01:18.800> also

00:01:19.090 --> 00:01:19.100 
fighting for at the moment it will also

fighting for at the moment it will also
cut<00:01:19.940> down<00:01:20.120> on<00:01:20.330> the<00:01:20.420> poaching<00:01:20.840> we're<00:01:21.740> dotting

00:01:22.090 --> 00:01:22.100 
cut down on the poaching we're dotting

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:24.100 
cut down on the poaching we're dotting
mr.<00:01:22.340> Rana<00:01:22.490> today<00:01:22.760> with<00:01:22.940> a<00:01:22.970> chemical<00:01:23.750> called

00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:24.110 
mr. Rana today with a chemical called

00:01:24.110 --> 00:01:26.380 
mr. Rana today with a chemical called
in<00:01:24.260> 99<00:01:24.740> which<00:01:25.070> is<00:01:25.190> it<00:01:25.400> of<00:01:25.550> him<00:01:25.730> which<00:01:26.270> is

00:01:26.380 --> 00:01:26.390 
in 99 which is it of him which is

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:29.610 
in 99 which is it of him which is
basically<00:01:26.810> a<00:01:26.930> very<00:01:27.200> potent<00:01:28.040> morphine<00:01:28.460> and

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:29.620 
basically a very potent morphine and

00:01:29.620 --> 00:01:31.750 
basically a very potent morphine and
from<00:01:30.620> runners<00:01:31.070> not<00:01:31.220> kind<00:01:31.370> of<00:01:31.400> sleep<00:01:31.640> is

00:01:31.750 --> 00:01:31.760 
from runners not kind of sleep is

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:34.260 
from runners not kind of sleep is
basically<00:01:32.030> immobilized<00:01:32.600> and<00:01:32.960> as<00:01:33.560> you<00:01:33.680> see

00:01:34.260 --> 00:01:34.270 
basically immobilized and as you see

00:01:34.270 --> 00:01:36.370 
basically immobilized and as you see
once<00:01:35.270> we<00:01:35.360> get<00:01:35.540> to<00:01:35.690> the<00:01:35.780> run<00:01:35.960> we'll<00:01:36.170> put

00:01:36.370 --> 00:01:36.380 
once we get to the run we'll put

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:38.140 
once we get to the run we'll put
earplugs<00:01:36.920> in<00:01:37.220> these<00:01:37.340> years<00:01:37.580> and<00:01:37.730> blindfold

00:01:38.140 --> 00:01:38.150 
earplugs in these years and blindfold

00:01:38.150 --> 00:01:39.460 
earplugs in these years and blindfold
him<00:01:38.240> so<00:01:38.390> it's<00:01:38.600> not<00:01:38.690> a<00:01:38.750> way<00:01:39.020> what's<00:01:39.290> going

00:01:39.460 --> 00:01:39.470 
him so it's not a way what's going

00:01:39.470 --> 00:01:42.520 
him so it's not a way what's going
around<00:01:40.030> any<00:01:41.030> surroundings<00:01:41.630> so<00:01:42.260> a<00:01:42.290> first

00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:42.530 
around any surroundings so a first

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:44.320 
around any surroundings so a first
chemical<00:01:42.830> like<00:01:43.190> I<00:01:43.280> said<00:01:43.460> to<00:01:43.550> a<00:01:43.640> dolphin<00:01:43.910> and

00:01:44.320 --> 00:01:44.330 
chemical like I said to a dolphin and

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:45.790 
chemical like I said to a dolphin and
then<00:01:44.480> I'm<00:01:44.570> gonna<00:01:44.690> just<00:01:44.930> put<00:01:45.140> a<00:01:45.170> little<00:01:45.410> anti

00:01:45.790 --> 00:01:45.800 
then I'm gonna just put a little anti

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:47.500 
then I'm gonna just put a little anti
stress<00:01:45.980> chemical<00:01:46.520> in<00:01:46.610> you<00:01:46.730> can<00:01:46.880> power<00:01:47.090> you<00:01:47.330> can

00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:47.510 
stress chemical in you can power you can

00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:49.360 
stress chemical in you can power you can
say<00:01:47.690> you<00:01:48.350> can<00:01:48.380> see<00:01:48.620> it's<00:01:48.710> also<00:01:48.860> called<00:01:49.070> stress

00:01:49.360 --> 00:01:49.370 
say you can see it's also called stress

00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:51.430 
say you can see it's also called stress
no<00:01:49.580> it's<00:01:50.300> just<00:01:50.420> helps<00:01:50.810> a<00:01:50.870> little<00:01:50.990> bit<00:01:51.170> of<00:01:51.320> the

00:01:51.430 --> 00:01:51.440 
no it's just helps a little bit of the

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:53.440 
no it's just helps a little bit of the
dot<00:01:51.620> in<00:01:51.830> the<00:01:52.010> whole<00:01:52.460> stress<00:01:52.820> of<00:01:52.970> the<00:01:53.060> capture

00:01:53.440 --> 00:01:53.450 
dot in the whole stress of the capture

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:56.140 
dot in the whole stress of the capture
and<00:01:53.900> then<00:01:54.860> all<00:01:55.010> just<00:01:55.220> balance<00:01:55.550> the<00:01:55.580> dotted<00:01:56.000> F

00:01:56.140 --> 00:01:56.150 
and then all just balance the dotted F

00:01:56.150 --> 00:01:59.290 
and then all just balance the dotted F
normal<00:01:56.540> sterile<00:01:56.990> water<00:01:57.970> okay<00:01:58.970> there's<00:01:59.180> three

00:01:59.290 --> 00:01:59.300 
normal sterile water okay there's three

00:01:59.300 --> 00:02:00.550 
normal sterile water okay there's three
different<00:01:59.510> ways<00:01:59.750> that<00:02:00.020> they<00:02:00.170> are<00:02:00.200> poaching

00:02:00.550 --> 00:02:00.560 
different ways that they are poaching
