00:00:51.830 --> 00:00:51.840 
active create and I'm pretty sure he's

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:55.790 
active create and I'm pretty sure he's
not<00:00:51.870> in<00:00:52.320> the<00:00:52.500> game<00:00:52.739> right<00:00:53.070> farm<00:00:53.489> so<00:00:54.270> um<00:00:54.780> I<00:00:55.140> went

00:00:55.790 --> 00:00:55.800 
not in the game right farm so um I went

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:57.920 
not in the game right farm so um I went
ahead<00:00:55.920> and<00:00:56.039> just<00:00:56.309> went<00:00:56.489> skipped<00:00:57.210> forward<00:00:57.660> to

00:00:57.920 --> 00:00:57.930 
ahead and just went skipped forward to

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:00.349 
ahead and just went skipped forward to
showing<00:00:58.140> you<00:00:58.260> what<00:00:58.850> team<00:00:59.850> I<00:00:59.969> put<00:01:00.120> him<00:01:00.239> on

00:01:00.349 --> 00:01:00.359 
showing you what team I put him on

00:01:00.359 --> 00:01:01.610 
showing you what team I put him on
because<00:01:00.539> I<00:01:00.719> ended<00:01:00.780> up<00:01:00.899> going<00:01:01.050> back<00:01:01.199> and

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:01.620 
because I ended up going back and

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:03.860 
because I ended up going back and
switching<00:01:02.039> the<00:01:02.190> player<00:01:02.640> type<00:01:02.910> he<00:01:03.449> was<00:01:03.570> really

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:03.870 
switching the player type he was really

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:05.329 
switching the player type he was really
difficult<00:01:04.049> to<00:01:04.320> gauge<00:01:04.559> like<00:01:04.890> he's<00:01:05.040> really<00:01:05.220> a

00:01:05.329 --> 00:01:05.339 
difficult to gauge like he's really a

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:07.399 
difficult to gauge like he's really a
gunslinger<00:01:05.760> as<00:01:06.090> a<00:01:06.119> player<00:01:06.390> but<00:01:06.869> I<00:01:06.930> didn't<00:01:07.200> want

00:01:07.399 --> 00:01:07.409 
gunslinger as a player but I didn't want

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:08.990 
gunslinger as a player but I didn't want
to<00:01:07.650> they<00:01:07.920> don't<00:01:07.950> have<00:01:08.189> a<00:01:08.220> gunslinger<00:01:08.490> trait

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:09.000 
to they don't have a gunslinger trait

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:11.539 
to they don't have a gunslinger trait
for<00:01:09.270> him<00:01:09.510> so<00:01:10.200> they<00:01:10.380> have<00:01:10.500> West<00:01:10.710> Coast<00:01:10.979> and<00:01:11.310> then

00:01:11.539 --> 00:01:11.549 
for him so they have West Coast and then

00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:12.770 
for him so they have West Coast and then
they<00:01:11.670> have<00:01:11.790> one<00:01:11.820> I<00:01:12.090> can't<00:01:12.390> remember<00:01:12.420> what<00:01:12.689> it

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:12.780 
they have one I can't remember what it

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:14.719 
they have one I can't remember what it
was<00:01:12.810> like<00:01:13.170> a<00:01:13.380> strong<00:01:13.860> arm<00:01:14.070> quarterback<00:01:14.460> and

00:01:14.719 --> 00:01:14.729 
was like a strong arm quarterback and

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:16.340 
was like a strong arm quarterback and
he's<00:01:15.090> really<00:01:15.240> a<00:01:15.360> strong<00:01:15.540> on<00:01:15.720> Porter<00:01:16.020> back<00:01:16.140> but

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:16.350 
he's really a strong on Porter back but

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:17.390 
he's really a strong on Porter back but
he's<00:01:16.439> a<00:01:16.470> West<00:01:16.710> Coast<00:01:16.770> quarterback<00:01:17.220> at<00:01:17.310> the

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:17.400 
he's a West Coast quarterback at the

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:19.010 
he's a West Coast quarterback at the
same<00:01:17.549> time<00:01:17.759> so<00:01:18.030> it<00:01:18.090> was<00:01:18.180> really<00:01:18.240> hard<00:01:18.720> I<00:01:18.869> just

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:19.020 
same time so it was really hard I just

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:21.350 
same time so it was really hard I just
picked<00:01:19.170> West<00:01:19.409> Coast<00:01:19.790> because<00:01:20.790> he<00:01:21.030> did<00:01:21.180> play

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:21.360 
picked West Coast because he did play

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:23.179 
picked West Coast because he did play
the<00:01:21.509> Packers<00:01:21.930> and<00:01:22.200> I<00:01:22.500> went<00:01:22.710> ahead<00:01:22.799> and<00:01:22.920> put<00:01:23.130> him

00:01:23.179 --> 00:01:23.189 
the Packers and I went ahead and put him

00:01:23.189 --> 00:01:26.390 
the Packers and I went ahead and put him
on<00:01:23.340> the<00:01:23.490> Packers<00:01:23.939> and<00:01:24.890> because<00:01:25.890> I<00:01:25.979> hate<00:01:26.130> Aaron

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:26.400 
on the Packers and because I hate Aaron

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:29.990 
on the Packers and because I hate Aaron
Rodgers<00:01:27.890> and<00:01:28.890> I<00:01:29.100> wanted<00:01:29.340> to<00:01:29.430> make<00:01:29.579> him<00:01:29.700> sit<00:01:29.909> the

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:30.000 
Rodgers and I wanted to make him sit the

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:32.210 
Rodgers and I wanted to make him sit the
bench<00:01:30.150> was<00:01:30.329> really<00:01:30.840> fun<00:01:31.079> to<00:01:31.290> do<00:01:31.439> by<00:01:31.860> the<00:01:31.920> way

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:32.220 
bench was really fun to do by the way

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:33.859 
bench was really fun to do by the way
