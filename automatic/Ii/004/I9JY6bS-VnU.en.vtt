label<00:02:40.799> and<00:02:41.030> so<00:02:42.030> if<00:02:42.360> we<00:02:42.630> go<00:02:42.840> over<00:02:42.959> here<00:02:43.110> to<00:02:43.170> the

00:02:43.370 --> 00:02:43.380 
label and so if we go over here to the

00:02:43.380 --> 00:02:44.870 
label and so if we go over here to the
dot<00:02:43.560> M<00:02:43.709> this<00:02:44.220> is<00:02:44.370> where<00:02:44.519> we're<00:02:44.610> going<00:02:44.730> to<00:02:44.790> do

00:02:44.870 --> 00:02:44.880 
dot M this is where we're going to do

00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:47.780 
dot M this is where we're going to do
our<00:02:44.910> code<00:02:45.299> so<00:02:46.140> first<00:02:46.709> we<00:02:46.920> want<00:02:47.099> to<00:02:47.160> access<00:02:47.610> our

00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:47.790 
our code so first we want to access our

00:02:47.790 --> 00:02:51.530 
our code so first we want to access our
actual<00:02:48.090> value<00:02:48.510> of<00:02:48.720> the<00:02:49.410> counter<00:02:50.129> I<00:02:50.970> mean<00:02:51.390> of

00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:51.540 
actual value of the counter I mean of

00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:52.970 
actual value of the counter I mean of
the<00:02:51.660> UI<00:02:51.840> slider<00:02:52.260> so<00:02:52.440> we're<00:02:52.560> going<00:02:52.650> to<00:02:52.739> use<00:02:52.769> the

00:02:52.970 --> 00:02:52.980 
the UI slider so we're going to use the

00:02:52.980 --> 00:02:54.620 
the UI slider so we're going to use the
counter<00:02:53.400> text<00:02:53.760> to<00:02:53.910> do<00:02:54.030> that<00:02:54.209> so<00:02:54.390> we're<00:02:54.540> going

00:02:54.620 --> 00:02:54.630 
counter text to do that so we're going

00:02:54.630 --> 00:02:56.720 
counter text to do that so we're going
to<00:02:54.720> go<00:02:54.780> get<00:02:55.230> our<00:02:55.350> calendar<00:02:55.739> label<00:02:56.040> and<00:02:56.400> we're

00:02:56.720 --> 00:02:56.730 
to go get our calendar label and we're

00:02:56.730 --> 00:02:59.629 
to go get our calendar label and we're
going<00:02:56.850> to<00:02:56.880> set<00:02:57.090> it<00:02:57.120> text<00:02:57.690> to<00:02:58.650> space<00:02:59.459> single

00:02:59.629 --> 00:02:59.639 
going to set it text to space single

00:02:59.639 --> 00:03:01.670 
going to set it text to space single
space<00:02:59.940> and<00:03:00.209> NS<00:03:00.450> string<00:03:00.750> that<00:03:01.109> holds<00:03:01.530> the

00:03:01.670 --> 00:03:01.680 
space and NS string that holds the

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:04.640 
space and NS string that holds the
actual<00:03:02.040> value<00:03:02.670> of<00:03:03.000> the<00:03:03.090> slider<00:03:03.389> so<00:03:04.200> if<00:03:04.319> we<00:03:04.470> just

00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:04.650 
actual value of the slider so if we just

00:03:04.650 --> 00:03:07.550 
actual value of the slider so if we just
to<00:03:04.799> do<00:03:05.190> to<00:03:05.340> our<00:03:05.430> brackets<00:03:05.880> here<00:03:05.940> and<00:03:06.290> i'll<00:03:07.290> type

00:03:07.550 --> 00:03:07.560 
to do to our brackets here and i'll type

00:03:07.560 --> 00:03:09.410 
to do to our brackets here and i'll type
this<00:03:07.709> out<00:03:07.920> and<00:03:08.100> I'll<00:03:08.370> be<00:03:08.489> back<00:03:08.639> in<00:03:09.209> a<00:03:09.329> minute

now if you followed my other tutorials

00:03:30.209 --> 00:03:32.629 
now if you followed my other tutorials
you<00:03:30.420> will<00:03:30.630> know<00:03:30.870> that<00:03:31.440> you<00:03:31.650> can<00:03:31.829> go<00:03:31.980> inside

00:03:32.629 --> 00:03:32.639 
you will know that you can go inside

00:03:32.639 --> 00:03:34.339 
you will know that you can go inside
these<00:03:33.269> things<00:03:33.569> when<00:03:33.750> you<00:03:33.840> want<00:03:33.989> to<00:03:34.109> put

00:03:34.339 --> 00:03:34.349 
these things when you want to put

00:03:34.349 --> 00:03:38.539 
these things when you want to put
something<00:03:34.560> inside<00:03:34.919> a<00:03:35.430> text<00:03:36.150> you<00:03:36.540> can<00:03:36.720> go<00:03:36.840> %<00:03:37.319> @<00:03:37.590> 4

00:03:38.539 --> 00:03:38.549 
something inside a text you can go % @ 4

00:03:38.549 --> 00:03:41.720 
something inside a text you can go % @ 4
for<00:03:39.389> text<00:03:39.780> or<00:03:39.930> object<00:03:40.349> values<00:03:40.799> or<00:03:41.340> you<00:03:41.489> can<00:03:41.639> go

00:03:41.720 --> 00:03:41.730 
for text or object values or you can go

00:03:41.730 --> 00:03:45.289 
for text or object values or you can go
%<00:03:42.060> I<00:03:42.180> for<00:03:42.630> integers<00:03:43.079> and<00:03:43.260> in<00:03:44.250> this<00:03:44.790> case<00:03:45.030> we're

00:03:45.289 --> 00:03:45.299 
% I for integers and in this case we're

00:03:45.299 --> 00:03:49.039 
% I for integers and in this case we're
doing<00:03:45.480> %<00:03:45.930> f<00:03:46.220> now<00:03:47.220> because<00:03:47.880> the<00:03:48.090> slider<00:03:48.450> value

00:03:49.039 --> 00:03:49.049 
doing % f now because the slider value

00:03:49.049 --> 00:03:51.530 
doing % f now because the slider value
which<00:03:49.380> is<00:03:49.530> an<00:03:49.650> integer<00:03:49.950> is<00:03:50.310> actually<00:03:51.000> a<00:03:51.030> float

00:03:51.530 --> 00:03:51.540 
which is an integer is actually a float

00:03:51.540 --> 00:03:54.199 
which is an integer is actually a float
value<00:03:51.840> we<00:03:52.169> need<00:03:52.319> to<00:03:52.410> use<00:03:52.500> %<00:03:52.919> f<00:03:53.099> but<00:03:53.910> float

00:03:54.199 --> 00:03:54.209 
value we need to use % f but float

00:03:54.209 --> 00:03:56.360 
value we need to use % f but float
values<00:03:54.630> have<00:03:54.810> a<00:03:54.870> lot<00:03:55.139> of<00:03:55.169> decimal<00:03:55.709> places<00:03:55.739> so

00:03:56.360 --> 00:03:56.370 
values have a lot of decimal places so

00:03:56.370 --> 00:04:00.140 
values have a lot of decimal places so
I've<00:03:57.090> put<00:03:57.450> dot<00:03:57.810> 1f<00:03:58.560> and<00:03:59.009> that<00:03:59.549> shortens<00:04:00.030> it

00:04:00.140 --> 00:04:00.150 
I've put dot 1f and that shortens it

00:04:00.150 --> 00:04:02.240 
I've put dot 1f and that shortens it
down<00:04:00.329> to<00:04:00.509> just<00:04:00.690> one<00:04:01.019> decimal<00:04:01.290> place<00:04:01.500> which

00:04:02.240 --> 00:04:02.250 
down to just one decimal place which

00:04:02.250 --> 00:04:03.890 
down to just one decimal place which
makes<00:04:02.489> it<00:04:02.609> easier<00:04:02.910> for<00:04:03.120> us<00:04:03.209> to<00:04:03.239> see

00:04:03.890 --> 00:04:03.900 
makes it easier for us to see

00:04:03.900 --> 00:04:05.300 
makes it easier for us to see
what<00:04:04.019> we're<00:04:04.200> doing<00:04:04.500> and<00:04:04.620> also<00:04:04.860> makes<00:04:05.220> it

00:04:05.300 --> 00:04:05.310 
what we're doing and also makes it

00:04:05.310 --> 00:04:07.759 
what we're doing and also makes it
easiest<00:04:05.610> for<00:04:06.060> our<00:04:06.239> later<00:04:06.510> things<00:04:06.989> as<00:04:07.620> you

00:04:07.759 --> 00:04:07.769 
easiest for our later things as you

00:04:07.769 --> 00:04:09.890 
easiest for our later things as you
noticed<00:04:08.069> here<00:04:08.220> the<00:04:08.370> slider<00:04:08.700> has<00:04:09.150> a<00:04:09.180> thing

00:04:09.890 --> 00:04:09.900 
noticed here the slider has a thing

00:04:09.900 --> 00:04:11.750 
noticed here the slider has a thing
where<00:04:10.110> you<00:04:10.200> can<00:04:10.319> actually<00:04:10.470> access<00:04:10.829> its<00:04:11.250> value

00:04:11.750 --> 00:04:11.760 
where you can actually access its value

00:04:11.760 --> 00:04:13.759 
where you can actually access its value
so<00:04:12.180> if<00:04:12.239> you<00:04:12.299> just<00:04:12.480> go<00:04:12.540> Slyder<00:04:12.900> doc<00:04:13.230> value<00:04:13.620> you

00:04:13.759 --> 00:04:13.769 
so if you just go Slyder doc value you

00:04:13.769 --> 00:04:16.430 
so if you just go Slyder doc value you
actually<00:04:14.459> get<00:04:14.610> its<00:04:14.730> value<00:04:15.090> and<00:04:15.239> I<00:04:15.959> have<00:04:16.169> built

00:04:16.430 --> 00:04:16.440 
actually get its value and I have built

00:04:16.440 --> 00:04:19.129 
actually get its value and I have built
it<00:04:16.590> here<00:04:16.769> so<00:04:17.039> if<00:04:17.100> I<00:04:17.220> just<00:04:17.789> zoom<00:04:18.030> out<00:04:18.180> so<00:04:18.479> as<00:04:19.049> you

00:04:19.129 --> 00:04:19.139 
it here so if I just zoom out so as you

00:04:19.139 --> 00:04:20.539 
it here so if I just zoom out so as you
can<00:04:19.229> see<00:04:19.380> as<00:04:19.470> we<00:04:19.590> move<00:04:19.769> their<00:04:19.979> style<00:04:20.190> label

00:04:20.539 --> 00:04:20.549 
can see as we move their style label

00:04:20.549 --> 00:04:23.210 
can see as we move their style label
changes<00:04:21.259> so<00:04:22.259> as<00:04:22.380> you<00:04:22.470> can<00:04:22.560> see<00:04:22.740> the<00:04:22.889> lowest

00:04:23.210 --> 00:04:23.220 
changes so as you can see the lowest

00:04:23.220 --> 00:04:25.129 
changes so as you can see the lowest
value<00:04:23.460> is<00:04:23.550> zero<00:04:23.850> point<00:04:24.120> zero<00:04:24.210> and<00:04:24.750> the<00:04:24.870> highest

00:04:25.129 --> 00:04:25.139 
value is zero point zero and the highest

00:04:25.139 --> 00:04:27.110 
value is zero point zero and the highest
value<00:04:25.380> is<00:04:25.470> 1<00:04:25.710> so<00:04:25.979> it<00:04:26.100> obviously<00:04:26.190> goes<00:04:26.580> from<00:04:26.789> 0

00:04:27.110 --> 00:04:27.120 
value is 1 so it obviously goes from 0

00:04:27.120 --> 00:04:29.629 
value is 1 so it obviously goes from 0
to<00:04:27.780> 1<00:04:27.990> and<00:04:28.229> in<00:04:28.710> between<00:04:28.860> is<00:04:29.280> obviously<00:04:29.550> the

00:04:29.629 --> 00:04:29.639 
to 1 and in between is obviously the

00:04:29.639 --> 00:04:31.430 
to 1 and in between is obviously the
normal<00:04:30.030> stuff<00:04:30.150> go<00:04:30.300> in<00:04:30.389> the<00:04:30.449> middle<00:04:30.720> it's<00:04:30.870> 0.5

00:04:31.430 --> 00:04:31.440 
normal stuff go in the middle it's 0.5

00:04:31.440 --> 00:04:34.730 
normal stuff go in the middle it's 0.5
0.60<00:04:32.100> senses<00:04:32.669> and<00:04:33.090> like<00:04:33.630> that<00:04:33.840> yeah<00:04:34.139> so

00:04:34.730 --> 00:04:34.740 
0.60 senses and like that yeah so

00:04:34.740 --> 00:04:36.830 
0.60 senses and like that yeah so
hopefully<00:04:35.550> understand<00:04:36.240> that<00:04:36.389> that's<00:04:36.630> how<00:04:36.780> you

00:04:36.830 --> 00:04:36.840 
hopefully understand that that's how you

00:04:36.840 --> 00:04:39.560 
hopefully understand that that's how you
access<00:04:37.139> the<00:04:37.560> value<00:04:37.949> of<00:04:38.190> a<00:04:38.310> slider<00:04:38.580> and<00:04:38.970> it's<00:04:39.300> a

00:04:39.560 --> 00:04:39.570 
access the value of a slider and it's a

00:04:39.570 --> 00:04:42.920 
access the value of a slider and it's a
float<00:04:39.840> value<00:04:40.080> so<00:04:40.830> I<00:04:41.430> will<00:04:42.270> now<00:04:42.389> do<00:04:42.449> the<00:04:42.750> if

00:04:42.920 --> 00:04:42.930 
float value so I will now do the if

00:04:42.930 --> 00:04:46.159 
float value so I will now do the if
statement<00:04:43.530> to<00:04:43.889> actually<00:04:44.250> change<00:04:44.490> our<00:04:45.169> texts

00:04:46.159 --> 00:04:46.169 
statement to actually change our texts

00:04:46.169 --> 00:04:48.230 
statement to actually change our texts
and<00:04:46.260> everything<00:04:46.710> and<00:04:46.889> I'll<00:04:47.789> be<00:04:47.910> back<00:04:48.030> in<00:04:48.180> a

00:04:48.230 --> 00:04:48.240 
and everything and I'll be back in a

00:04:48.240 --> 00:04:50.360 
and everything and I'll be back in a
minute<00:04:48.410> alright<00:04:49.410> guys<00:04:49.560> i'm<00:04:49.770> back<00:04:49.800> and<00:04:50.160> as<00:04:50.280> you

00:04:50.360 --> 00:04:50.370 
minute alright guys i'm back and as you

00:04:50.370 --> 00:04:52.370 
minute alright guys i'm back and as you
can<00:04:50.520> see<00:04:50.550> I've<00:04:50.789> added<00:04:50.970> an<00:04:51.539> if<00:04:51.690> statement<00:04:51.840> here

00:04:52.370 --> 00:04:52.380 
can see I've added an if statement here

00:04:52.380 --> 00:04:55.370 
can see I've added an if statement here
and<00:04:52.590> I've<00:04:53.460> basically<00:04:53.669> just<00:04:54.210> use<00:04:54.570> the<00:04:54.840> sliders

00:04:55.370 --> 00:04:55.380 
and I've basically just use the sliders

00:04:55.380 --> 00:04:57.890 
and I've basically just use the sliders
value<00:04:55.830> and<00:04:56.039> I've<00:04:56.460> said<00:04:56.669> if<00:04:56.849> the<00:04:57.150> slider<00:04:57.449> value

00:04:57.890 --> 00:04:57.900 
value and I've said if the slider value

00:04:57.900 --> 00:05:03.409 
value and I've said if the slider value
is<00:04:58.080> greater<00:04:58.560> than<00:04:58.979> or<00:04:59.220> equal<00:04:59.760> to<00:05:00.860> 0.5<00:05:01.860> then<00:05:02.419> the

00:05:03.409 --> 00:05:03.419 
is greater than or equal to 0.5 then the

00:05:03.419 --> 00:05:07.460 
is greater than or equal to 0.5 then the
label<00:05:03.900> text<00:05:04.740> equals<00:05:05.580> danger<00:05:06.449> so<00:05:06.900> you<00:05:07.229> could

00:05:07.460 --> 00:05:07.470 
label text equals danger so you could

00:05:07.470 --> 00:05:08.870 
label text equals danger so you could
use<00:05:07.620> this<00:05:07.740> for<00:05:07.889> some<00:05:08.039> sort<00:05:08.220> of<00:05:08.250> game<00:05:08.460> up<00:05:08.669> if

00:05:08.870 --> 00:05:08.880 
use this for some sort of game up if

00:05:08.880 --> 00:05:10.520 
use this for some sort of game up if
they're<00:05:09.060> selecting<00:05:09.660> a<00:05:09.720> setting<00:05:10.139> and<00:05:10.349> then<00:05:10.410> you

00:05:10.520 --> 00:05:10.530 
they're selecting a setting and then you

00:05:10.530 --> 00:05:12.500 
they're selecting a setting and then you
go<00:05:10.620> danger<00:05:11.070> that's<00:05:11.250> too<00:05:11.520> high<00:05:11.789> you<00:05:11.849> might<00:05:12.090> die

00:05:12.500 --> 00:05:12.510 
go danger that's too high you might die

00:05:12.510 --> 00:05:14.150 
go danger that's too high you might die
or<00:05:12.810> something<00:05:13.289> like<00:05:13.530> that<00:05:13.620> you<00:05:13.830> can<00:05:13.979> use<00:05:14.130> it

00:05:14.150 --> 00:05:14.160 
or something like that you can use it

00:05:14.160 --> 00:05:16.550 
or something like that you can use it
for<00:05:14.370> that<00:05:14.550> and<00:05:14.760> I've<00:05:15.210> also<00:05:15.330> set<00:05:16.080> the<00:05:16.110> text

00:05:16.550 --> 00:05:16.560 
for that and I've also set the text

00:05:16.560 --> 00:05:19.790 
for that and I've also set the text
color<00:05:16.919> to<00:05:17.430> red<00:05:17.699> so<00:05:18.180> it<00:05:18.330> kind<00:05:18.539> of<00:05:18.800> implements

00:05:19.790 --> 00:05:19.800 
color to red so it kind of implements

00:05:19.800 --> 00:05:21.620 
color to red so it kind of implements
the<00:05:19.919> danger<00:05:20.400> thing<00:05:20.550> it's<00:05:20.699> bright<00:05:21.060> red<00:05:21.090> as<00:05:21.539> a

00:05:21.620 --> 00:05:21.630 
the danger thing it's bright red as a

00:05:21.630 --> 00:05:24.200 
the danger thing it's bright red as a
guard<00:05:21.810> danger<00:05:22.199> and<00:05:23.099> then<00:05:23.280> otherwise<00:05:23.580> I<00:05:24.000> want

00:05:24.200 --> 00:05:24.210 
guard danger and then otherwise I want

00:05:24.210 --> 00:05:25.790 
guard danger and then otherwise I want
it<00:05:24.270> to<00:05:24.389> stay<00:05:24.570> hidden<00:05:24.810> so<00:05:25.139> I've<00:05:25.260> gone<00:05:25.409> labeled

00:05:25.790 --> 00:05:25.800 
it to stay hidden so I've gone labeled

00:05:25.800 --> 00:05:28.279 
it to stay hidden so I've gone labeled
or<00:05:25.919> text<00:05:26.280> equals<00:05:27.000> no<00:05:27.449> text<00:05:27.840> so<00:05:27.930> basically<00:05:28.260> I

00:05:28.279 --> 00:05:28.289 
or text equals no text so basically I

00:05:28.289 --> 00:05:29.899 
or text equals no text so basically I
didn't<00:05:28.620> type<00:05:28.740> anything<00:05:28.919> in<00:05:29.370> between<00:05:29.520> the<00:05:29.789> out

00:05:29.899 --> 00:05:29.909 
didn't type anything in between the out

00:05:29.909 --> 00:05:32.120 
didn't type anything in between the out
quotes<00:05:30.150> and<00:05:30.479> I've<00:05:31.050> gone<00:05:31.199> labeled<00:05:31.650> up<00:05:31.800> text

00:05:32.120 --> 00:05:32.130 
quotes and I've gone labeled up text

00:05:32.130 --> 00:05:34.189 
quotes and I've gone labeled up text
color<00:05:32.310> space<00:05:33.000> equal<00:05:33.300> spaces<00:05:33.690> your<00:05:33.840> eye<00:05:33.870> color

00:05:34.189 --> 00:05:34.199 
color space equal spaces your eye color

00:05:34.199 --> 00:05:36.170 
color space equal spaces your eye color
clear<00:05:34.740> color<00:05:35.070> and<00:05:35.310> that's<00:05:35.820> kind<00:05:36.150> of

00:05:36.170 --> 00:05:36.180 
clear color and that's kind of

00:05:36.180 --> 00:05:38.290 
clear color and that's kind of
self-explanatory<00:05:36.479> it's<00:05:37.110> just<00:05:37.320> a<00:05:37.500> clear<00:05:37.889> color

00:05:38.290 --> 00:05:38.300 
self-explanatory it's just a clear color

00:05:38.300 --> 00:05:41.870 
self-explanatory it's just a clear color
so<00:05:39.300> I<00:05:39.539> have<00:05:39.780> built<00:05:40.050> it<00:05:40.199> again<00:05:40.560> to<00:05:40.740> save<00:05:40.919> time<00:05:41.250> so

00:05:41.870 --> 00:05:41.880 
so I have built it again to save time so

00:05:41.880 --> 00:05:43.610 
so I have built it again to save time so
if<00:05:41.970> you<00:05:42.060> see<00:05:42.240> here<00:05:42.270> here's<00:05:42.810> our<00:05:42.960> label<00:05:43.349> in<00:05:43.530> the

00:05:43.610 --> 00:05:43.620 
if you see here here's our label in the

00:05:43.620 --> 00:05:46.159 
if you see here here's our label in the
middle<00:05:43.860> and<00:05:44.039> as<00:05:44.310> I<00:05:44.460> move<00:05:44.699> it<00:05:44.880> if<00:05:45.479> it's<00:05:45.750> go<00:05:45.960> if

00:05:46.159 --> 00:05:46.169 
middle and as I move it if it's go if

00:05:46.169 --> 00:05:49.129 
middle and as I move it if it's go if
you<00:05:46.260> go<00:05:46.409> down<00:05:46.710> you<00:05:47.010> can<00:05:47.220> see<00:05:47.250> it's<00:05:47.610> now<00:05:47.789> 0.2<00:05:48.599> 0.3

you go down you can see it's now 0.2 0.3

00:05:49.139 --> 00:05:52.520 
you go down you can see it's now 0.2 0.3
0.4<00:05:49.800> is<00:05:50.159> now<00:05:50.370> below<00:05:50.760> 0.5<00:05:51.300> and<00:05:51.750> then<00:05:52.020> I<00:05:52.050> move<00:05:52.289> up

00:05:52.520 --> 00:05:52.530 
0.4 is now below 0.5 and then I move up

00:05:52.530 --> 00:05:55.310 
0.4 is now below 0.5 and then I move up
0.5<00:05:53.310> you<00:05:53.520> can<00:05:53.669> see<00:05:53.849> the<00:05:54.000> labels<00:05:54.389> are<00:05:54.510> kid<00:05:54.690> it's

0.5 you can see the labels are kid it's

00:05:55.320 --> 00:05:57.320 
0.5 you can see the labels are kid it's
a<00:05:55.440> bit<00:05:55.620> small<00:05:55.830> but<00:05:56.010> still<00:05:56.520> says<00:05:56.729> danger<00:05:57.000> and

and<00:06:03.510> so<00:06:04.500> yep<00:06:05.370> that's<00:06:05.790> a<00:06:06.060> quick<00:06:06.240> tutorial<00:06:06.690> on

00:06:06.740 --> 00:06:06.750 
and so yep that's a quick tutorial on

00:06:06.750 --> 00:06:08.480 
and so yep that's a quick tutorial on
you<00:06:06.930> I<00:06:06.960> sliders<00:06:07.530> and<00:06:07.650> how<00:06:07.740> to<00:06:07.800> access<00:06:08.040> their

00:06:08.480 --> 00:06:08.490 
you I sliders and how to access their

00:06:08.490 --> 00:06:12.080 
you I sliders and how to access their
values<00:06:08.970> and<00:06:09.150> use<00:06:09.690> them<00:06:09.870> for<00:06:09.900> a<00:06:10.080> purpose<00:06:11.090> so

00:06:12.080 --> 00:06:12.090 
values and use them for a purpose so

00:06:12.090 --> 00:06:13.880
