00:02:00.889 --> 00:02:00.899 
betting patterns so I may take this down

00:02:00.899 --> 00:02:03.350 
betting patterns so I may take this down
at<00:02:01.530> the<00:02:01.649> beginner<00:02:01.979> to<00:02:02.310> mediate<00:02:02.670> by<00:02:02.790> accident

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:03.360 
at the beginner to mediate by accident

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:05.719 
at the beginner to mediate by accident
but<00:02:03.570> it<00:02:04.229> sounded<00:02:04.619> like<00:02:04.649> you<00:02:05.009> really<00:02:05.040> want<00:02:05.579> to

00:02:05.719 --> 00:02:05.729 
but it sounded like you really want to

00:02:05.729 --> 00:02:08.630 
but it sounded like you really want to
look<00:02:06.600> for<00:02:06.659> things<00:02:07.020> long-term<00:02:07.860> with<00:02:08.459> these

00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:08.640 
look for things long-term with these

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:10.520 
look for things long-term with these
players<00:02:08.970> and<00:02:09.330> maybe<00:02:09.479> some<00:02:09.720> regular<00:02:10.110> player

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:10.530

if<00:02:10.619> you<00:02:10.740> play<00:02:10.950> online<00:02:11.130> whichever<00:02:12.030> it<00:02:12.180> is<00:02:12.270> right

00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:12.630 
if you play online whichever it is right

00:02:12.630 --> 00:02:14.030 
if you play online whichever it is right
develop<00:02:13.080> these<00:02:13.170> patterns<00:02:13.530> might<00:02:13.709> be<00:02:13.800> a<00:02:13.830> long

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:14.040 
develop these patterns might be a long

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:16.130 
develop these patterns might be a long
session<00:02:14.580> and<00:02:14.970> then<00:02:15.360> there's<00:02:15.569> of<00:02:15.690> course<00:02:15.930> just

00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:16.140 
session and then there's of course just

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:18.350 
session and then there's of course just
that<00:02:16.350> given<00:02:16.680> hand<00:02:16.980> there's<00:02:17.459> little<00:02:17.700> details

00:02:18.350 --> 00:02:18.360 
that given hand there's little details

that given hand there's little details
that<00:02:18.480> you<00:02:18.630> can<00:02:18.840> do<00:02:19.050> right<00:02:19.500> so<00:02:19.530> with<00:02:20.250> all<00:02:20.430> that

00:02:20.449 --> 00:02:20.459

00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:42.570 
person played this hand this way when

00:02:42.570 --> 00:02:45.199

you're<00:02:42.690> playing<00:02:42.900> live<00:02:43.670> you<00:02:44.670> know<00:02:44.760> I<00:02:44.790> tend<00:02:45.120> to

00:02:45.199 --> 00:02:45.209 
you're playing live you know I tend to

00:02:45.209 --> 00:02:47.630 
you're playing live you know I tend to
use<00:02:45.300> my<00:02:45.480> memory<00:02:46.019> a<00:02:46.200> little<00:02:46.440> bit<00:02:46.590> more<00:02:46.890> but<00:02:47.250> it

00:02:47.630 --> 00:02:47.640 
use my memory a little bit more but it

00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:49.550 
use my memory a little bit more but it
would<00:02:47.790> probably<00:02:47.940> be<00:02:48.450> helpful<00:02:48.840> if<00:02:48.959> I<00:02:49.080> wrote

00:02:49.550 --> 00:02:49.560 
would probably be helpful if I wrote

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:51.470 
would probably be helpful if I wrote
down<00:02:49.739> some<00:02:49.800> things<00:02:50.100> cuz<00:02:50.610> you're<00:02:51.330> definitely

know what type of hand

00:04:08.130 --> 00:04:10.130 
know what type of hand
could<00:04:08.519> they<00:04:08.670> have<00:04:08.700> it's<00:04:09.480> the<00:04:09.630> early<00:04:09.900> stage<00:04:09.930> of

00:04:10.130 --> 00:04:10.140 
could they have it's the early stage of

00:04:10.140 --> 00:04:12.500 
could they have it's the early stage of
the<00:04:10.440> tournament<00:04:10.650> there's<00:04:11.130> no<00:04:11.310> antes<00:04:11.700> I<00:04:12.060> don't

00:04:12.500 --> 00:04:12.510 
the tournament there's no antes I don't

00:04:12.510 --> 00:04:13.849 
the tournament there's no antes I don't
have<00:04:12.630> a<00:04:12.660> lot<00:04:12.810> of<00:04:12.840> information<00:04:13.170> on<00:04:13.500> this<00:04:13.620> player

00:04:13.859 --> 00:04:15.440 
have a lot of information on this player
but<00:04:14.340> I'm<00:04:14.430> gonna<00:04:14.609> guess<00:04:14.820> they<00:04:14.970> have<00:04:15.060> a<00:04:15.120> premium

00:04:15.440 --> 00:04:15.450 
but I'm gonna guess they have a premium

00:04:15.450 --> 00:04:16.909 
but I'm gonna guess they have a premium
hand<00:04:15.780> if<00:04:15.959> they're<00:04:16.140> raising<00:04:16.289> from<00:04:16.620> early

00:04:16.909 --> 00:04:16.919 
hand if they're raising from early

00:04:16.919 --> 00:04:18.860 
hand if they're raising from early
position<00:04:17.100> so<00:04:17.910> they<00:04:18.030> should<00:04:18.209> have<00:04:18.359> ace<00:04:18.539> king

00:04:18.860 --> 00:04:18.870 
position so they should have ace king

00:04:18.870 --> 00:04:22.820 
position so they should have ace king
ace<00:04:19.169> queen<00:04:19.919> or<00:04:20.280> you<00:04:21.030> know<00:04:21.150> pocket<00:04:21.989> any<00:04:22.380> pocket

00:06:43.550 --> 00:06:43.560 
betting all the time well then you don't

00:06:43.560 --> 00:06:45.830 
betting all the time well then you don't
give<00:06:43.770> them<00:06:43.920> much<00:06:44.580> credit<00:06:44.910> for<00:06:45.060> that<00:06:45.180> if<00:06:45.450> it's

00:06:45.830 --> 00:06:45.840 
give them much credit for that if it's

someone<00:06:46.140> that<00:06:46.170> only<00:06:46.380> see<00:06:46.680> that's<00:06:46.890> you<00:06:47.490> know

00:06:47.570 --> 00:06:47.580 
someone that only see that's you know

00:06:47.580 --> 00:06:49.970 
someone that only see that's you know
half<00:06:48.180> the<00:06:48.300> time<00:06:48.420> and<00:06:48.930> then<00:06:49.410> you<00:06:49.500> try<00:06:49.680> to<00:06:49.740> figure

00:06:49.970 --> 00:06:49.980 
half the time and then you try to figure

00:06:49.980 --> 00:06:51.470 
half the time and then you try to figure
out<00:06:50.190> when<00:06:50.730> they're<00:06:50.910> see<00:06:51.060> betting<00:06:51.360> when
