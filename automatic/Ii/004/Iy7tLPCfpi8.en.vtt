00:00:12.379 --> 00:00:12.389 
I'm showing you how to make an

00:00:12.389 --> 00:00:14.600 
I'm showing you how to make an
unreadable<00:00:12.630> base<00:00:12.990> so<00:00:13.349> far<00:00:13.679> it<00:00:14.040> is<00:00:14.280> unreadable

00:00:14.600 --> 00:00:14.610 
unreadable base so far it is unreadable

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:16.550 
unreadable base so far it is unreadable
you<00:00:15.240> can<00:00:15.420> enter<00:00:15.630> pro<00:00:15.839> underneath<00:00:16.230> of<00:00:16.440> it

00:00:16.550 --> 00:00:16.560 
you can enter pro underneath of it

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:20.359 
you can enter pro underneath of it
because<00:00:17.100> of<00:00:17.220> that<00:00:17.460> um<00:00:17.850> you<00:00:18.720> cannot<00:00:19.260> TT<00:00:19.949> it<00:00:20.070> and

00:00:20.359 --> 00:00:20.369 
because of that um you cannot TT it and

00:00:20.369 --> 00:00:22.880 
because of that um you cannot TT it and
you<00:00:20.760> cannot<00:00:21.090> be<00:00:21.600> clip<00:00:21.960> that's<00:00:22.410> what<00:00:22.650> I<00:00:22.680> was

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:22.890

00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:46.980 
your base i'm going to do a 50 seven by

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:50.420 
your base i'm going to do a 50 seven by
seven<00:00:47.010> so<00:00:48.620> okay<00:00:49.620> here<00:00:49.800> we<00:00:49.890> go<00:00:49.920> and<00:00:50.309> I'll<00:00:50.399> just

should work no Vic no free camming into

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:37.010 
should work no Vic no free camming into
your<00:01:34.830> base<00:01:34.950> um<00:01:35.430> which<00:01:36.360> will<00:01:36.540> just<00:01:36.690> allow<00:01:36.840> them

00:01:37.010 --> 00:01:37.020 
your base um which will just allow them

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:38.450 
your base um which will just allow them
to<00:01:37.110> open<00:01:37.320> chest<00:01:37.590> outside<00:01:37.890> of<00:01:37.980> your<00:01:38.070> base<00:01:38.190> now

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:38.460 
to open chest outside of your base now

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:40.580 
to open chest outside of your base now
you<00:01:38.520> put<00:01:38.760> a<00:01:38.790> roof<00:01:39.060> on<00:01:39.240> top<00:01:39.300> of<00:01:39.780> it<00:01:39.900> so<00:01:40.380> there's

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:40.590 
you put a roof on top of it so there's

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:41.990 
you put a roof on top of it so there's
you'll<00:01:40.770> have<00:01:40.980> to<00:01:41.190> room<00:01:41.430> I<00:01:41.520> know<00:01:41.580> you<00:01:41.730> can't

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:42.000 
you'll have to room I know you can't

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:44.480 
you'll have to room I know you can't
jump<00:01:42.270> but<00:01:42.360> it<00:01:43.260> works<00:01:43.500> now<00:01:43.680> I<00:01:43.710> said<00:01:44.010> the<00:01:44.190> base

00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:44.490 
jump but it works now I said the base

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:47.300 
jump but it works now I said the base
can<00:01:44.730> be<00:01:44.760> as<00:01:45.120> big<00:01:45.540> and<00:01:45.780> one<00:01:46.410> as<00:01:46.650> you<00:01:46.980> want<00:01:47.220> it

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:47.310 
can be as big and one as you want it

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:49.250 
can be as big and one as you want it
maybe<00:01:48.030> not<00:01:48.210> white<00:01:48.480> because<00:01:48.810> I'm<00:01:48.930> saying<00:01:49.170> you

about<00:04:13.480> almost<00:04:14.080> two<00:04:14.440> stacks<00:04:15.040> of<00:04:15.430> wooden<00:04:16.000> planks

00:04:16.289 --> 00:04:16.299 
about almost two stacks of wooden planks

00:04:16.299 --> 00:04:18.420 
about almost two stacks of wooden planks
maybe<00:04:16.510> not<00:04:17.230> for<00:04:17.410> this<00:04:17.530> baby<00:04:17.799> about<00:04:17.950> one<00:04:18.160> stack

00:04:18.420 --> 00:04:18.430 
maybe not for this baby about one stack

00:04:18.430 --> 00:04:21.750 
maybe not for this baby about one stack
but<00:04:18.790> for<00:04:19.269> good<00:04:19.630> big<00:04:19.959> nice<00:04:20.230> space<00:04:20.620> these<00:04:21.549> two

00:04:21.750 --> 00:04:21.760 
but for good big nice space these two

00:04:21.760 --> 00:04:24.330 
but for good big nice space these two
stacks<00:04:22.090> of<00:04:22.620> wooden<00:04:23.620> planks<00:04:23.919> are<00:04:24.010> at<00:04:24.100> least<00:04:24.220> a

00:04:24.330 --> 00:04:24.340 
stacks of wooden planks are at least a

00:04:24.340 --> 00:04:26.550 
stacks of wooden planks are at least a
stack<00:04:24.550> of<00:04:24.580> vlogs<00:04:25.150> is<00:04:25.840> all<00:04:26.020> I<00:04:26.050> can<00:04:26.200> really<00:04:26.410> say

stack of vlogs is all I can really say

00:04:26.560 --> 00:04:29.340 
stack of vlogs is all I can really say
but<00:04:27.490> it<00:04:28.000> can<00:04:28.120> copy<00:04:28.300> this<00:04:28.480> space<00:04:28.810> design<00:04:29.140> if<00:04:29.260> you

00:04:29.340 --> 00:04:29.350 
but it can copy this space design if you

00:04:29.350 --> 00:04:31.050
