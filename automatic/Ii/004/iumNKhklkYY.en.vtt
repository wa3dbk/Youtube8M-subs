00:00:06.840 --> 00:00:08.709
 Naturally 

00:00:08.709 --> 00:00:13.329
 a unique in the Mercedes south to seven sitting and the luxury of his 

00:00:13.329 --> 00:00:14.969
 s-class 

00:00:14.969 --> 00:00:17.230
 sounds extraordinary 

00:00:17.230 --> 00:00:20.230
 but meets the core of the new generation of the r-class 

00:00:20.749 --> 00:00:23.749
 Fini with a lot of distrust prestige 

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:33.300
 his 

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:45.120
 because he is smiling 

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:46.040
 added 

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:49.030
 new CD is an impressive vibrant city 

00:00:49.030 --> 00:00:52.730
 but every once in a while "It's nice to see green coming out at weekends and where 

00:00:52.730 --> 00:00:53.760
 on the doorstep 

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:56.030
 I'm sure that has sovereign on 4 

00:00:56.030 --> 00:00:58.100
 it's like that from Greens 

00:00:58.100 --> 00:01:00.710
 and that with the perfect companion of the new r-class 

00:01:00.710 --> 00:01:02.750
 a coffee in the empty streets 

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:05.750
 what could I want more 

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:11.800
 what the first driving impression in the new r-class is sovereign 

00:01:11.800 --> 00:01:15.850
 Uneven floors smoothed or too critical at point and momentum too 

00:01:15.850 --> 00:01:16.590
 to lose 

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:19.320
 and which I also appreciated but on the way home 

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:22.720
 where in this country like not only life but also times on the right is overtaken 

00:01:22.720 --> 00:01:26.650
 The Blind Spot Assistant is more than helpful and extremely comfortable 

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:31.929
 see these 

00:01:31.929 --> 00:01:34.889
 I can not complain about the available space 

00:01:34.889 --> 00:01:39.840
 r-class but not in the middle of security now seats all the same cell Spence 

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:43.889
 and there it has its own top priority and offers the new r-class 

00:01:43.889 --> 00:01:47.420
 a comprehensive security package that is to say 

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:49.010
 just sit back 

00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:52.010
 and the ride leads 

00:02:01.470 --> 00:02:04.780
 already very impressive the IFM real estate offered so one 

00:02:04.780 --> 00:02:06.110
 generously cut 

00:02:06.110 --> 00:02:09.060
 and so generously cut the r-class as appropriate 

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:12.800
 Equipment for up to seven people Place in Suzuka showed the players from 

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:15.800
 Place as NATO has prepared here 

00:02:31.759 --> 00:02:32.640
 to go 

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:36.170
 From time to time we men are very difficult to accept help from us 

00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:41.140
 when it comes to driving but honestly welcome every now and then 

00:02:41.140 --> 00:02:42.709
 but very much 

00:02:42.709 --> 00:02:45.709
 Rearview mirror shows the option to have 

00:02:49.269 --> 00:02:52.269
 to use the optionally available reversing camera 

00:02:53.049 --> 00:02:56.590
 Of course, the r-class has been completely reworked what you get for one 

00:02:56.590 --> 00:02:57.939
 at the new tail lights 

00:02:57.939 --> 00:03:01.280
 or unrolled to the perfectly integrated in the rear apron 

00:03:04.959 --> 00:03:07.480
 Of course a lot has happened in the front as well 

00:03:07.480 --> 00:03:10.420
 as well as their headlights, for example, in the current Design Space 

00:03:10.420 --> 00:03:14.230
 from Mercedes Benz perfect one but this was not in the face of this now 

00:03:14.230 --> 00:03:14.850
 winner 

00:03:14.850 --> 00:03:17.890
 the pulpit in the middle gives the whole thing even more dynamism 

00:03:18.569 --> 00:03:20.089
 summarizing us 

00:03:20.089 --> 00:03:23.110
 you have to hold on Mercedes Benz has done his homework 

00:03:23.110 --> 00:03:26.840
 and comfort and safety with the luxury of the luxury class and how Ralf weather 

00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:29.840
 Suitability of one is certainly parked 

00:03:34.419 --> 00:03:35.500
 Freeman's them 

00:03:35.500 --> 00:03:38.079
 Family car and Suze 

00:03:38.079 --> 00:03:42.049
 no matter what you want to use the address with her, they are always 

00:03:43.259 --> 00:03:44.159
