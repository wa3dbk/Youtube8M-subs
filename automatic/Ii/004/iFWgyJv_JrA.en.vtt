bit lighter however because of the

00:03:45.350 --> 00:03:47.199 
bit lighter however because of the
design<00:03:45.650> you<00:03:45.950> also<00:03:45.980> don't<00:03:46.400> have<00:03:46.579> that<00:03:46.820> iPad

00:03:47.199 --> 00:03:47.209

wobble<00:03:47.810> that<00:03:47.989> we<00:03:48.380> saw<00:03:48.739> with<00:03:48.920> the

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:49.010 
wobble that we saw with the

00:03:49.010 --> 00:03:50.229 
wobble that we saw with the
first-generation<00:03:49.250> when<00:03:49.670> you<00:03:49.730> put<00:03:49.880> on<00:03:50.000> a<00:03:50.030> flat

00:03:50.229 --> 00:03:50.239

Motorola Xoom let's bring that in to for
a<00:04:59.990> real<00:05:00.170> quick<00:05:00.380> size<00:05:00.590> comparison<00:05:00.620> we'll<00:05:01.490> go

00:05:01.630 --> 00:05:01.640 
a real quick size comparison we'll go

00:05:01.640 --> 00:05:03.420 
a real quick size comparison we'll go
ahead<00:05:01.760> and<00:05:01.940> stack<00:05:02.240> them<00:05:02.420> see<00:05:02.960> that<00:05:03.110> there's

00:05:03.420 --> 00:05:03.430 
ahead and stack them see that there's

00:05:03.430 --> 00:05:06.550 
ahead and stack them see that there's
definitely<00:05:04.430> difference<00:05:04.970> their<00:05:05.330> iPad<00:05:06.110> 2<00:05:06.290> is<00:05:06.440> a

00:05:06.550 --> 00:05:06.560 
definitely difference their iPad 2 is a

00:05:06.560 --> 00:05:09.040 
definitely difference their iPad 2 is a
little<00:05:06.800> bit<00:05:06.950> thinner<00:05:07.510> but<00:05:08.510> the<00:05:08.690> zoom<00:05:08.870> is

00:05:09.040 --> 00:05:09.050 
little bit thinner but the zoom is

00:05:09.050 --> 00:05:11.710 
little bit thinner but the zoom is
definitely<00:05:09.410> a<00:05:09.440> little<00:05:09.560> bit<00:05:09.770> narrower<00:05:10.450> so<00:05:11.450> push

00:05:11.710 --> 00:05:11.720 
definitely a little bit narrower so push

00:05:11.720 --> 00:05:12.880 
definitely a little bit narrower so push
those<00:05:11.930> off<00:05:12.110> and<00:05:12.230> we'll<00:05:12.350> be<00:05:12.440> doing<00:05:12.530> a<00:05:12.710> full

00:05:12.880 --> 00:05:12.890 
those off and we'll be doing a full

00:05:12.890 --> 00:05:16.060 
those off and we'll be doing a full
