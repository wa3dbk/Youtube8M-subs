00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.929
 hi guys, how are you? 

00:00:01.500 --> 00:00:06.150
 welcome to apple 5 x 1 in this video 

00:00:03.929 --> 00:00:12.120
 we bring you 10 curiosities about them 9 

00:00:06.150 --> 00:00:13.530
 we started in this update to grow 

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:16.410
 and assures us that if we have a 

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:18.869
 old device like an iphone 4s or 

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:21.150
 an ipad 2 for example let's notice a 

00:00:18.869 --> 00:00:23.400
 great performance in both consumption of 

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:26.609
 battery as in what has been in 

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:29.189
 user experience and 29 is the 

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:30.720
 more perhaps more powerful update in 

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:33.780
 for performance that has brought apple 

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:36.600
 and perhaps the most striking from the great 

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:38.550
 visual change that we saw in ios 7 so 

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:39.960
 We will see what we have on store 

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:41.579
 with all the development of this new 

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:43.530
 version and who knows if maybe 

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:45.989
 we will see maybe some change 

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:48.210
 aesthetic already for it is 10 in this 

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:49.920
 new update ios 9 what 

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:54.230
 before it happens to occupy the operating system 

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:57.800
 the quite scandalous figure of 4 GB 

00:00:54.230 --> 00:00:59.840
 of memory now it stays at 15 so 

00:00:57.800 --> 00:01:02.750
 you're going to have a lot more space 

00:00:59.840 --> 00:01:04.699
 to make music photos or whatever you want 

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:06.260
 nowadays in the moments in which 

00:01:04.699 --> 00:01:08.330
 we are recording this video we have 

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:10.010
 it is 9 of tadÃ³ is one of the best 

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:11.930
 beta without a doubt that they remember 

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:14.390
 a lot of time and eye we are talking about 

00:01:11.930 --> 00:01:17.720
 a beta 2 of which we could see as 

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:19.759
 long all summer 4 5 up to 6 betas well 

00:01:17.720 --> 00:01:21.979
 that the performance of it is 9 is 

00:01:19.759 --> 00:01:23.869
 quite hopeful besides very 

00:01:21.979 --> 00:01:25.400
 possibly the next beta that we see 

00:01:23.869 --> 00:01:27.680
 when you are watching this video could 

00:01:25.400 --> 00:01:30.050
 be the one that integrates music paper that comes out 

00:01:27.680 --> 00:01:32.149

 raised with the finger what happens is yes 

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:44.330
 It is true that with the good finger 

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:45.890
 it is a bit cumbersome what makes us 

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:48.440
 think that in some future 

00:01:45.890 --> 00:01:51.530
