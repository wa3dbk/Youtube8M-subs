00:01:57.070 --> 00:01:57.080 
hearing today because I heard from my

00:01:57.080 --> 00:01:58.480 
hearing today because I heard from my
dad<00:01:57.170> and<00:01:57.380> I<00:01:57.530> heard<00:01:57.680> from<00:01:57.770> saber<00:01:58.040> of<00:01:58.250> what<00:01:58.369> they

00:01:58.480 --> 00:01:58.490 
dad and I heard from saber of what they

00:01:58.490 --> 00:01:59.649 
dad and I heard from saber of what they
thought<00:01:58.640> of<00:01:58.700> the<00:01:58.850> trailer<00:01:59.150> and<00:01:59.299> I've<00:01:59.479> been

00:01:59.649 --> 00:01:59.659 
thought of the trailer and I've been

00:01:59.659 --> 00:02:01.719 
thought of the trailer and I've been
seeing<00:01:59.869> the<00:02:00.170> the<00:02:00.590> comments<00:02:01.009> online<00:02:01.130> about

00:02:01.719 --> 00:02:01.729 
seeing the the comments online about

00:02:01.729 --> 00:02:03.730 
seeing the the comments online about
like<00:02:02.060> you<00:02:02.299> know<00:02:02.330> this<00:02:02.630> is<00:02:02.659> CG<00:02:03.080> and<00:02:03.259> whatnot<00:02:03.530> but

00:02:03.730 --> 00:02:03.740 
like you know this is CG and whatnot but

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:06.010 
like you know this is CG and whatnot but
I<00:02:03.950> think<00:02:04.640> people<00:02:04.820> don't<00:02:05.150> realize<00:02:05.570> just<00:02:05.600> how

00:02:06.010 --> 00:02:06.020 
I think people don't realize just how

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:09.550 
I think people don't realize just how
long<00:02:06.560> ago<00:02:06.950> the<00:02:07.159> prequels<00:02:07.549> word<00:02:07.989> you<00:02:08.989> know<00:02:09.019> the

00:02:18.850 --> 00:02:18.860 
remasters are very dated the the CG and

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:21.009 
remasters are very dated the the CG and
those<00:02:19.010> are<00:02:19.189> very<00:02:19.370> very<00:02:19.700> dated<00:02:20.090> this<00:02:20.629> actually

00:02:21.009 --> 00:02:21.019

looks you know really good really good
cg<00:02:24.730> so<00:02:26.110> yeah<00:02:27.110> it<00:02:27.379> it<00:02:28.159> looks<00:02:28.519> like<00:02:28.730> it's

00:02:28.929 --> 00:02:28.939 
cg so yeah it it looks like it's

00:02:28.939 --> 00:02:31.360 
cg so yeah it it looks like it's
returning<00:02:29.750> back<00:02:29.930> to<00:02:29.959> the<00:02:30.230> way<00:02:30.799> it<00:02:30.950> was<00:02:30.980> like

00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:31.370 
returning back to the way it was like

00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:33.970 
returning back to the way it was like
like<00:02:32.269> it's<00:02:32.480> um<00:02:32.720> it's<00:02:33.049> not<00:02:33.500> going<00:02:33.590> to<00:02:33.680> be<00:02:33.769> quite

00:02:33.970 --> 00:02:33.980 
like it's um it's not going to be quite

00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:36.940 
like it's um it's not going to be quite
you<00:02:34.610> know<00:02:34.640> as<00:02:34.940> as<00:02:35.360> fantastic<00:02:35.870> as<00:02:36.230> the<00:02:36.470> the

00:02:36.940 --> 00:02:36.950 
you know as as fantastic as the the

00:02:36.950 --> 00:02:41.410 
you know as as fantastic as the the
first<00:02:38.379> three<00:02:39.379> star<00:02:39.590> wars<00:02:39.799> work<00:02:39.980> but<00:02:40.819> I<00:02:41.030> think

00:02:41.410 --> 00:02:41.420 
first three star wars work but I think

00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:43.780 
first three star wars work but I think
it's<00:02:41.569> going<00:02:41.720> to<00:02:41.920> have<00:02:42.920> a<00:02:42.950> lot<00:02:43.190> of<00:02:43.250> fans<00:02:43.519> happy

00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:43.790 
it's going to have a lot of fans happy

00:02:43.790 --> 00:02:45.910 
it's going to have a lot of fans happy
so<00:02:44.750> far<00:02:44.780> from<00:02:45.109> what<00:02:45.200> we'll<00:02:45.470> be<00:02:45.620> seeing<00:02:45.829> we

00:03:19.720 --> 00:03:19.730 
again like I said I'm not really the

00:03:19.730 --> 00:03:23.039 
again like I said I'm not really the
biggest<00:03:19.879> star<00:03:20.120> wars<00:03:20.329> fan<00:03:20.510> but<00:03:21.139> um<00:03:21.859> I<00:03:21.919> know<00:03:22.549> that

00:03:23.039 --> 00:03:23.049 
biggest star wars fan but um I know that

00:03:23.049 --> 00:03:26.050 
biggest star wars fan but um I know that
I<00:03:24.049> think<00:03:24.349> people<00:03:24.560> are<00:03:24.949> going<00:03:25.069> to<00:03:25.220> take<00:03:25.760> this

00:03:26.050 --> 00:03:26.060 
I think people are going to take this

00:03:26.060 --> 00:03:31.390 
I think people are going to take this
over<00:03:27.400> what<00:03:28.400> could<00:03:28.639> have<00:03:28.760> been<00:03:28.940> with<00:03:30.400> someone

00:03:31.390 --> 00:03:31.400 
over what could have been with someone

00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:34.150 
over what could have been with someone
else<00:03:31.549> doing<00:03:32.000> it<00:03:32.209> I<00:03:32.419> think<00:03:33.019> JB<00:03:33.290> JJ<00:03:33.590> Abrams<00:03:34.040> is

00:03:34.150 --> 00:03:34.160 
else doing it I think JB JJ Abrams is

00:03:34.160 --> 00:03:36.580 
else doing it I think JB JJ Abrams is
sort<00:03:34.639> of<00:03:34.669> a<00:03:34.790> good<00:03:35.209> fit<00:03:35.540> for<00:03:35.780> the<00:03:36.290> star<00:03:36.470> wars
