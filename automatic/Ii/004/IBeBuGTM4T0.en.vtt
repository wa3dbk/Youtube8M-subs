00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.799
 Hi there, this is a review of the asus g555 laptop 

00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:07.560
 j 

00:00:04.799 --> 00:00:10.710
 courtesy of mind not advertising 

00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:13.139
 advertising agency large dose 

00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:15.269
 new customers and the laptop itself 

00:00:13.139 --> 00:00:18.330
 here comes in such usually 

00:00:15.269 --> 00:00:21.090
 notebook box which is not for it 

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:22.890
 left right before but this time before here 

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:23.699
 from this side is written his technical 

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:25.800
 specifications 

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:28.230
 I'm a little bit later, let them tell 

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:30.750
 rather, let's see what's inside 

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:32.669
 this is a big and beautiful box 

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:36.809
 Now the point here and there opens here 

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:38.910
 this one has opened and here is the republic badge 

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:41.550
 of gamer type for gamers 

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:44.070
 Well, then open and here we have 

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:45.539
 The laptop itself, and it seems a little bit 

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:48.570
 let's talk to the end 

00:00:45.539 --> 00:00:51.780
 and its such to withstand 

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:53.809
 I donâ€™t know what is in the box itself 

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:57.140
 this for garbage rag probably 

00:00:53.809 --> 00:00:59.370
 user's manual 

00:00:57.140 --> 00:01:04.890
 something about wi-fi 

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:06.510
 some certificates something else too 

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:08.909
 something else is good and uninteresting from anyone 

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:11.430
 tour further further that we have here and here 

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:15.630
 here we have part of the power supply then 

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:19.590
 there is a cable and and and and and there is still some 

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:21.930
 here is a cord to wire 

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:26.299
 twist cool thing probably yes 

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:27.750
 cable there and so on, what else can 

00:01:26.299 --> 00:01:30.840
 by 

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:35.790
 power supply is a huge power supply 

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:38.100
 19 to 632 and in principle a normal block 

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:39.020
 food as he did not kill anyone there yet 

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:42.329
 hands and yes 

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:45.990
 cup ashtray what is it 

00:01:42.329 --> 00:01:47.850
 there is a subwoofer that's such a leash 

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:50.579
 connects to a laptop from this laptop 

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:53.939
 Bombovsky just awesome sound I'm like 

00:01:50.579 --> 00:01:56.490
 listened thought surprised but i basically 

00:01:53.939 --> 00:01:58.799
 surprised in general this is a subwoofer we have it so 

00:01:56.490 --> 00:02:00.740
 and my brother canâ€™t throw him away 

00:01:58.799 --> 00:02:03.930
 break therefore set aside 

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:07.159
 before you can throw and that we have here yet 

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:07.159
 what else do we have here 

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:17.040
 no empty it is not taken out 

00:02:13.459 --> 00:02:20.520
 all all all all all in a box more 

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:22.850
 nothing interesting so let's go 

00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:25.950
 to the laptop itself 

00:02:22.850 --> 00:02:27.750
 here we got him cross-site he whole 

00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:30.180
 metallic it is absolutely all 

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:32.300
 metallic except no that's it all 

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:36.080
 metalworker this is also in my lumen 

00:02:32.300 --> 00:02:39.150
 here here is the brand fashion logo 

00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:41.519
 what is it like for gamers and so let's go 

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:43.650
 Smiling at his portal in general and more specifically 

00:02:41.519 --> 00:02:45.680
 why does he have 10 vent 

00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:48.360
 holes because he is here two powerful 

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:51.390
 cooler and from here shorter the air is blown out 

00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:53.280
 here is here in my 4 or 3 

00:02:51.390 --> 00:02:55.350
 or the door I do not remember how much to prick 

00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:57.780
 but the sound is amazing when 

00:02:55.350 --> 00:03:00.690
 The first time I heard was just surprised 

00:02:57.780 --> 00:03:03.420
 very much on his left side 

00:03:00.690 --> 00:03:05.400
 Means some kind of hole for the power supply 

00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:09.030
 this is a subwoofer connector 

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:10.680
 this is north of the hdmi connector this i dont 

00:03:09.030 --> 00:03:13.620
 I know what is also something probably 

00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:16.560
 connector of some 2 on this side 2 yusb 

00:03:13.620 --> 00:03:19.470
 30 headphone out 

00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:21.120
 combined with don't know this 

00:03:19.470 --> 00:03:24.000
 front side except light bulbs 

00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:27.049
 there is nothing more indicators on the right 

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:29.760
 side one more yusbi 30 card reader 

00:03:27.049 --> 00:03:31.350
 drive and something else one hole mountain 

00:03:29.760 --> 00:03:34.200
 this in order for accounting to do somewhere 

00:03:31.350 --> 00:03:35.880
 cool and basically more special into it 

00:03:34.200 --> 00:03:38.160
 there is nothing he is so whole 

00:03:35.880 --> 00:03:42.630
 the laptop is red-black all so insolent 

00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:44.519
 let's open the food here will appoint 

00:03:42.630 --> 00:03:49.670
 keyboard which is highlighted 

00:03:44.519 --> 00:03:53.010
 red light garbage nakleechki icon 

00:03:49.670 --> 00:03:55.410
 full hd screen but I have specifically full 

00:03:53.010 --> 00:03:57.750
 hd screen resolution full hd ips matrix 

00:03:55.410 --> 00:04:00.450
 By the way I want to say that the angles are in 

00:03:57.750 --> 00:04:02.549
 this laptop taxi is ok so so 

00:04:00.450 --> 00:04:04.140
 It means that on the keyboard, especially except 

00:04:02.549 --> 00:04:05.030
 the fact that it is cool is highlighted in 

00:04:04.140 --> 00:04:07.290
 the dark 

00:04:05.030 --> 00:04:09.420
 nothing more especially as there is still 

00:04:07.290 --> 00:04:14.870
 awesomely soft keystroke 

00:04:09.420 --> 00:04:16.590
 super quiet soft comfortable gorgeous 

00:04:14.870 --> 00:04:17.310
 programmable button can here 

00:04:16.590 --> 00:04:19.169
 ask how 

00:04:17.310 --> 00:04:20.910
 and applications or what we game some 

00:04:19.169 --> 00:04:23.490
 like the inclusion 

00:04:20.910 --> 00:04:25.139
 I specifically turned off the light but the main 

00:04:23.490 --> 00:04:26.700
 lights to at least like when you turn on 

00:04:25.139 --> 00:04:28.380
 it was evident that here is so cool 

00:04:26.700 --> 00:04:31.590
 red key illumination 

00:04:28.380 --> 00:04:33.660
 let's turn on the laptop while it is 

00:04:31.590 --> 00:04:35.250
 I'll turn on a little briefly 

00:04:33.660 --> 00:04:37.350
 about its technical characteristics 

00:04:35.250 --> 00:04:41.940
 turn on at the same time see the time of inclusion 

00:04:37.350 --> 00:04:45.630
 so on board that i7 4770 processor 

00:04:41.940 --> 00:04:49.919
 in my glasses not cut 16 gigs 

00:04:45.630 --> 00:04:52.290
 operatives video card gifors jetix 850 m 

00:04:49.919 --> 00:04:56.070
 on 4 giga ii 

00:04:52.290 --> 00:04:57.990
 full hd matte screen which is very simple 

00:04:56.070 --> 00:05:00.030
 great i like it that we already 

00:04:57.990 --> 00:05:03.030
 turned on and all tell what screen 

00:05:00.030 --> 00:05:05.639
 matt i just adore it as for 

00:05:03.030 --> 00:05:07.860
 viewing angles as I said earlier angles 

00:05:05.639 --> 00:05:10.470
 The review here is so-so generally so-so well 

00:05:07.860 --> 00:05:13.320
 how would you expect such a wave letter angles 

00:05:10.470 --> 00:05:16.770
 review is not good here 0 I do not know 

00:05:13.320 --> 00:05:18.300
 began to find fault and i will say so so 

00:05:16.770 --> 00:05:19.830
 means the process told us that it 

00:05:18.300 --> 00:05:23.370
 operatives said the video said main 

00:05:19.830 --> 00:05:25.979
 With regards to games, I looked at what games 

00:05:23.370 --> 00:05:28.669
 here are the basic ones 

00:05:25.979 --> 00:05:33.060
 games like these games watch dogs 

00:05:28.669 --> 00:05:34.800
 battle battle 4 well krayzis no edge here 

00:05:33.060 --> 00:05:37.260
 at maximum and not at maximum and 

00:05:34.800 --> 00:05:39.900
 at high settings they all go without 

00:05:37.260 --> 00:05:43.770
 problems 30 fps gives out to the light that 

00:05:39.900 --> 00:05:45.090
 It concerns a crisis of 25 fps on slightly higher than 

00:05:43.770 --> 00:05:49.020
 medium settings coming 

00:05:45.090 --> 00:05:51.960
 as far cry 4 is also high 

00:05:49.020 --> 00:05:54.680
 It goes but it sags up to 25 fps in general 

00:05:51.960 --> 00:05:57.270
 play more or less modern games 

00:05:54.680 --> 00:06:01.110
 porridge on the ultra will not work but on 

00:05:57.270 --> 00:06:02.850
 high settings will turn out like you 

00:06:01.110 --> 00:06:05.970
 seen despite the fact that here are ordinary 

00:06:02.850 --> 00:06:08.160
 disk ssd there on terabyte with speed 7 

00:06:05.970 --> 00:06:10.680
 200 it turns on pretty quickly and 

00:06:08.160 --> 00:06:12.360
 here's the keyboard as I do not know to force 

00:06:10.680 --> 00:06:14.490
 you will see yes yes it is highlighted 

00:06:12.360 --> 00:06:16.580
 that's it just me just 

00:06:14.490 --> 00:06:18.660
 struck and now I turn on 

00:06:16.580 --> 00:06:20.910
 any sound show you what's here 

00:06:18.660 --> 00:06:22.800
 by simply amazing sound but by the way 

00:06:20.910 --> 00:06:23.650
 multitouch will support there a variety 

00:06:22.800 --> 00:06:26.290
 feminine up 

00:06:23.650 --> 00:06:29.380
 three fingers something else supports 

00:06:26.290 --> 00:06:31.750
 gestures battery keeps about four hours it's in 

00:06:29.380 --> 00:06:33.789
 reading mode, that's the principle 

00:06:31.750 --> 00:06:36.850
 by the way she is here for 4000 milliamps 

00:06:33.789 --> 00:06:38.650
 Well, I donâ€™t know many things like that or 

00:06:36.850 --> 00:06:41.800
 it's not enough for a laptop in general 4 hours 

00:06:38.650 --> 00:06:44.050
 for this giant metal powerful 

00:06:41.800 --> 00:06:46.720
 a monster of such bold all red 

00:06:44.050 --> 00:06:47.440
 it's me so awesome numbers so now 

00:06:46.720 --> 00:06:50.199
 will launch 

00:06:47.440 --> 00:06:52.960
 sound and show how the sound and 

00:06:50.199 --> 00:06:58.500
 Immediately with a connected subwoofer turn on 

00:06:52.960 --> 00:07:04.560
 the sound is not hear 

00:06:58.500 --> 00:07:04.560
 Generally it is maxim 

00:07:09.449 --> 00:07:13.990
 pripyat 

00:07:10.809 --> 00:07:16.029
 if you take on makame you are still very 

00:07:13.990 --> 00:07:18.819
 loud sound plus this here's the thing 

00:07:16.029 --> 00:07:20.709
 need to put a laptop on the table and to 

00:07:18.819 --> 00:07:22.830
 he was doing something like that 

00:07:20.709 --> 00:07:26.979
 work 

00:07:22.830 --> 00:07:29.080
 the world is cool as the phone in general 

00:07:26.979 --> 00:07:31.659
 the sound struck me here as well 

00:07:29.080 --> 00:07:34.240
 how im acting 200 is so impudent 

00:07:31.659 --> 00:07:37.209
 metallic black with red and more 

00:07:34.240 --> 00:07:39.819
 backlit keys and not on the boat with a guitar 

00:07:37.209 --> 00:07:41.769
 he is flowing with a friend and kissing as always 

00:07:39.819 --> 00:07:44.769
 skin for the current length link in 

00:07:41.769 --> 00:07:46.389
 description if suddenly you understand this video 

00:07:44.769 --> 00:07:47.830
 put your thumb up and 

00:07:46.389 --> 00:07:49.659
 subscribe to my channel come in 

00:07:47.830 --> 00:07:52.199
 look at advertising agencies 

00:07:49.659 --> 00:07:52.199
 until 

00:07:59.090 --> 00:08:01.090
 but
