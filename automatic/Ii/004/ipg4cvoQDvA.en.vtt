00:00:06.655 --> 00:00:10.525
 Welcome to the intensive course of the wind traveler monk. 

00:00:10.941 --> 00:00:14.821
 In this video we will briefly explain what you have to do 

00:00:15.173 --> 00:00:17.837
 to play with the Wind Traveler at level 90. 

00:00:19.037 --> 00:00:22.885
 The Wind Traveler uses two resources: energy and chi. 

00:00:23.285 --> 00:00:25.844
 The energy is used to generate chi. 

00:00:26.084 --> 00:00:29.349
 The chi will allow you to use the most powerful attacks. 

00:00:30.309 --> 00:00:33.710
 If before fighting you activate the White Tiger Legacy 

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:36.982
 the statistics and the critical probability will increase. 

00:00:37.285 --> 00:00:40.489
 In combat, Atizar will be the main source of chi. 

00:00:40.780 --> 00:00:43.689
 Use it if you do not have enough chi for something better. 

00:00:44.204 --> 00:00:48.513
 Then, use Palm of the Tiger, which grants Tiger Power. 

00:00:49.149 --> 00:00:52.765
 It only costs 1 p. of chi, but inflicts little damage 

00:00:52.941 --> 00:00:55.673
 so use it only to activate the benefit. 

00:00:56.016 --> 00:00:58.639
 Kick of the rising sun also has priority. 

00:00:58.885 --> 00:01:02.877
 Use it if it is available and if Tiger Power is active. 

00:01:03.276 --> 00:01:06.725
 The same with Fists of Fury: use it whenever you can. 

00:01:07.013 --> 00:01:10.109
 If not, use the chi for Dark Kick. 

00:01:11.077 --> 00:01:12.869
 With this basic rotation 

00:01:13.029 --> 00:01:15.476
 we must watch the Rompecombos activation. 

00:01:15.836 --> 00:01:18.872
 When using Atizar, you may activate Rompecombos 

00:01:19.032 --> 00:01:21.069
 for Palm of the tiger or Dark kick 

00:01:21.229 --> 00:01:24.013
 and you can cast them without any cost of chi. 

00:01:24.533 --> 00:01:26.237
 When Rompecombos activates 

00:01:26.397 --> 00:01:28.897
 Icons appear next to the character. 

00:01:29.549 --> 00:01:31.949
 The one on the left is for Palma del tiger 

00:01:32.109 --> 00:01:34.658
 and the one on the right for Dark Kick. 

00:01:35.118 --> 00:01:37.660
 Kick of the rising sun is more important 

00:01:37.820 --> 00:01:40.432
 but if it is not available, use the other two. 

00:01:41.249 --> 00:01:43.741
 There is much to learn to master the monk 

00:01:43.901 --> 00:01:48.125
 but we hope we have helped you a little to move in the right direction. 

00:01:48.285 --> 00:01:51.920
 When you have an idea, you should study carefully 

00:01:52.080 --> 00:01:54.831
 the book of spells, talents and glyphs 

00:01:54.991 --> 00:01:57.674
 to see what we have not mentioned here. 

00:01:58.104 --> 00:02:01.154
 Thank you very much and see you in Draenor!
