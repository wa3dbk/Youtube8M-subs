00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.580
 first john chapter 1 verses 6 

00:00:03.529 --> 00:00:12.389
 says so do not be put in an unequal game 

00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:15.540
 with unbelievers because society can 

00:00:12.389 --> 00:00:17.550
 injustice and iniquity, and there I 

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:19.500
 I keep thinking when I read this and we 

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:25.529
 let's see that the context is exactly 

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:30.090
 in this sense is that positive work 

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:31.740
 for the testimony can give this confusion 

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:34.950
 that we are seeing today 

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:40.800
 these blocks of believers that mix 

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:43.890
 there who thinks who you are 

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:47.969
 think it dominates the carnival scene 

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:49.820
 Christians are those who are there clear 

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:53.879
 that does not 

00:00:49.820 --> 00:00:55.020
 the game here is exactly the game of 

00:00:53.879 --> 00:00:59.219
 sin 

00:00:55.020 --> 00:01:01.500
 the demonstration visible to all is the 

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:05.070
 demonstration of the sin of impurity 

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:06.960
 immorality and the text says not so 

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:10.040
 we will win in unequal play with the 

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:14.610
 unbelievers because society can have 

00:01:10.040 --> 00:01:19.110
 injustice and iniquity that communion 

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:23.549
 light in darkness that harmony between 

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:25.280
 Christ and the evil one that the believer's union 

00:01:23.549 --> 00:01:29.189
 as an unbeliever 

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:32.939
 what a connection to the shrine of God 

00:01:29.189 --> 00:01:35.280
 and idols because we are sanctuaries 

00:01:32.939 --> 00:01:38.280
 of a living God as he said himself 

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:42.180
 I will live to walk among them, I will be your 

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:44.939
 God and they will be my people to my 

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:47.579
 brothers and sisters, may our testimony be 

00:01:44.939 --> 00:01:49.770
 by our different walk through our 

00:01:47.579 --> 00:01:52.350
 fortress for the people of god 

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:56.189
 adhering to the principles and precepts of 

00:01:52.350 --> 00:02:00.479
 God and if we do so our light goes 

00:01:56.189 --> 00:02:02.700
 shine and people were attracted to the 

00:02:00.479 --> 00:02:05.369
 sacrifice of jesus christ to power 

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:07.649
 savior of the gospel through our 

00:02:05.369 --> 00:02:09.780
 testimony but nowhere in the 

00:02:07.649 --> 00:02:12.720
 word of God we are commanded until 

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:13.740
 confusion to mix with this 

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:15.690
 way 

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:18.150
 where only the iniquity where only the 

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:20.040
 perversion 

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:22.980
 we have to testify that we have to 

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:25.500
 preach but what we are seeing in 

00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:27.780
 today is involvement in a party 

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:31.880
 and there is no demonstration of joy that 

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:31.880
 confuses with pagan joy
