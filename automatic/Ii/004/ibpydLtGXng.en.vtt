00:00:05.590 --> 00:00:09.099
 address book that gives you answers to questions that 

00:00:07.360 --> 00:00:10.959
 you never took your place and you didn't 

00:00:09.099 --> 00:00:22.439
 just rub family etc or the 

00:00:10.959 --> 00:00:22.439
 acronym like never never ever with a good look 

00:00:24.079 --> 00:00:28.710
 yes it is so it is here you guys are 

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:30.179
 ready to expand your borders 

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:32.099
 cultural if you are watching this 

00:00:30.179 --> 00:00:33.540
 video probably not but the came 

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:35.610
 time to broaden your horizons 

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:37.320
 and what better way if you don't learn 

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:38.879
 a bunch of things to casaccia that 

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:40.559
 you will forget for 10 minutes and for 

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:42.510
 this is how i am 

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:44.070
 or explanations of four curiosities 

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:45.989
 that serves no purpose but you know what it does 

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:47.820
 very cool to tell around but like in 

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:49.649
 every good program that provides culture 

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:51.629
 consumerist for a zotic public 

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:54.509
 gullible to the four as never before 

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:56.850
 a hoax remains a hoax is one 

00:00:54.509 --> 00:00:58.500
 false news that might seem real 

00:00:56.850 --> 00:01:02.390
 but it wasn't even for the fuck 

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:02.390
 you will be able to understand which I challenge you 

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:11.729
 the name derives from a type of meat 

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:13.100
 box spies m abbreviated spam than in 

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:15.299
 a comic sketch of the monty python 

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:17.340
 set in a restaurant it came 

00:01:15.299 --> 00:01:19.110
 persistently served inside 

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:20.759
 every dish that was offered to a 

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:22.200
 customer that spam 

00:01:20.759 --> 00:01:24.060
 just not creative and since it is 

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:25.860
 sketch was very successful since then 

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:27.869
 word spam and associated with something 

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:29.789
 unwanted, that is, in things like or beautiful 

00:01:27.869 --> 00:01:32.430
 you want to go out if you damage messina 

00:01:29.789 --> 00:01:34.820
 eating something dancing is smeared 

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:34.820
 fuck 

00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:42.320
 tomato garlic oil oregano and nothing that 

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:43.759
 recalls the sea ​​a little strange no the 

00:01:42.320 --> 00:01:45.170
 the fact is that the chair villas that stood 

00:01:43.759 --> 00:01:46.700
 long and port of naples at that time 

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:49.130
 continue the pizza only with 

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:50.780
 tomato and oil and at most a single 

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:52.610
 point they say and at most the absolute 

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:54.140
 which, however, cost sailors so much 

00:01:52.610 --> 00:01:55.939
 who were regular visitors to the 

00:01:54.140 --> 00:01:57.590
 pizzerias because it is near 

00:01:55.939 --> 00:01:58.880
 therefore asked the pizzaioli of 

00:01:57.590 --> 00:02:01.610
 add some ingredients anyway 

00:01:58.880 --> 00:02:03.439
 it is more than just a little pizza flavor 

00:02:01.610 --> 00:02:04.970
 did increase the price is so a 

00:02:03.439 --> 00:02:06.890
 pizza maker from port'alba decided to 

00:02:04.970 --> 00:02:08.810
 to add to the aquarium was a 

00:02:06.890 --> 00:02:10.729
 successively the water pizza all 

00:02:08.810 --> 00:02:13.220
 sailors and from that moment on 

00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:14.269
 pizza of sailors and pizza marinara 

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:16.010
 anyway mine must be ours 

00:02:14.269 --> 00:02:17.480
 It is amazing that the name of a bee is dancing 

00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:19.220
 different from what's inside I want 

00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:21.650
 says the carbonara is not that there is inside 

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:24.489
 with coal if we or restaurants would order 

00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:24.489
 it all seems to come out 

00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:32.130
 it's very simple because this comes from 

00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:34.170
 from the fact that both rabbits and hares 

00:02:32.130 --> 00:02:35.820
 they are the most fertile animals of all 

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:37.830
 and therefore since antiquity they became 

00:02:35.820 --> 00:02:39.360
 symbol of renewal of life and 

00:02:37.830 --> 00:02:41.010
 spring eye though that if they tell you 

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:43.940
 zombies like a rabbit do n't 

00:02:41.010 --> 00:02:43.940
 they are making a compliment 

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:49.430
 Yup 

00:02:47.410 --> 00:02:51.770
 laughing our body produces 

00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:53.510
 very small amounts of nitrous oxide 

00:02:51.770 --> 00:02:55.400
 nitrogen than at temperature and pressure 

00:02:53.510 --> 00:02:57.260
 environment is a colorless gas not 

00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:58.850
 flammable what is used 

00:02:57.260 --> 00:03:00.740
 in large quantities to produce gas 

00:02:58.850 --> 00:03:02.690
 exhilarating because of its effects 

00:03:00.740 --> 00:03:04.730
 exhilarating what happens that this 

00:03:02.690 --> 00:03:06.440
 gas is automatically inhaled from the 

00:03:04.730 --> 00:03:07.940
 our lungs and the immediate effect is 

00:03:06.440 --> 00:03:09.500
 that of reducing stress 

00:03:07.940 --> 00:03:11.000
 however I recommend you don't laugh when the 

00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:14.560
 your man strips if you can 

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:14.560
 parry even a couple of ass fans 

00:03:30.210 --> 00:03:33.960
 and the straits was the very last one 

00:03:32.550 --> 00:03:35.490
 I think it was the most banal one though 

00:03:33.960 --> 00:03:37.110
 in my opinion, the one with the rabbit 

00:03:35.490 --> 00:03:38.340
 he wanted to deceive because the later 

00:03:37.110 --> 00:03:40.230
 Instead scene is just so 

00:03:38.340 --> 00:03:42.870
 and in fact it laughs and does not produce its own 

00:03:40.230 --> 00:03:46.200
 nothing the only thing who does and that 

00:03:42.870 --> 00:03:47.670
 stress decreases esteem naturally 

00:03:46.200 --> 00:03:49.800
 management reinforces defenses 

00:03:47.670 --> 00:03:51.300
 immune seems to be doing the spot 

00:03:49.800 --> 00:03:52.530
 production increases in the bp 

00:03:51.300 --> 00:03:53.730
 of endorphins which are the so-called 

00:03:52.530 --> 00:03:55.920
 happiness hormones 

00:03:53.730 --> 00:03:57.960
 so laughing is good regardless e 

00:03:55.920 --> 00:03:59.880
 make this video a laugh for 

00:03:57.960 --> 00:04:01.740
 liked and now the why of the day 

00:03:59.880 --> 00:04:04.020
 the thing that asks me comes from the sewers 

00:04:01.740 --> 00:04:05.520
 hello potatoes like women never have 

00:04:04.020 --> 00:04:07.110
 only seeds while others 

00:04:05.520 --> 00:04:08.790
 mammals reasons the more you get to 

00:04:07.110 --> 00:04:10.620

00:04:08.790 --> 00:04:12.390

 video yes we want to send yours 

00:04:14.070 --> 00:04:17.340
 question you can do it safely 

00:04:15.440 --> 00:04:19.560
 uploading it as the best answer to 

00:04:17.340 --> 00:04:21.690

00:04:23.400 --> 00:04:26.400
 in short, let me get some way from 

00:04:25.050 --> 00:04:27.930
 what is really important to me 

00:04:26.400 --> 00:04:30.390
 I recommend was the bullet and the question 

00:04:27.930 --> 00:04:31.950
 like why bla bla bla and not why 

00:04:30.390 --> 00:04:34.410
 the blah blah blah well if I am not 

00:04:31.950 --> 00:04:36.030
 Cain is made to make the question more 

00:04:34.410 --> 00:04:38.270
 original will come later at the end of 

00:04:36.030 --> 00:04:38.270
