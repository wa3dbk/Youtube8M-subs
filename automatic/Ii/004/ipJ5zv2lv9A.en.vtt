00:00:00.460 --> 00:00:06.760
 yes Manufacturing familiar of 

00:00:03.400 --> 00:00:11.400
 Nagano Prefecture supports Japan as a technological nation 

00:00:06.760 --> 00:00:11.400
 We introduce many of the world-class technologies 

00:00:15.740 --> 00:00:27.780
 For example, if you set up this program and start knitting, it will appear as a product immediately 

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:30.970
 Computer controlled knitting and rule fabric gold 

00:00:27.780 --> 00:00:37.130
 Ri that brute great reliability of Medicine things 

00:00:30.970 --> 00:00:41.640
 This time, we will introduce the state-of-the-art entrepreneurial support facilities opened in April this year 

00:00:37.130 --> 00:00:44.230
 This is the only university in Japan that has such facilities 

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:46.579
 Here is the latest facility 

00:00:44.230 --> 00:00:48.550
 Fiber Innovation Incubator 

00:00:46.579 --> 00:00:52.420
 Fiber that of sincerity and 

00:00:48.550 --> 00:00:57.630
 Innovation is an innovation incubator shares the company 

00:00:52.420 --> 00:01:05.180
 In other words, facilities that support entrepreneurship with innovative fiber technology 

00:00:57.630 --> 00:01:08.500
 It is the biggest merit to say that you can let the latest edge use Rikiya knitting machine etc. 

00:01:05.180 --> 00:01:12.600
 When it comes to potential, it tends to image medical care such as clothes . 

00:01:08.500 --> 00:01:15.700
 The Faculty of Textile also studies new materials 

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:19.990
 For example, this nanofiber manufacturing device 

00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:23.020
 Artificially make thin fibers to molecular level 

00:01:19.990 --> 00:01:27.530
 It's not just this kind of clothes, even though it is textile 

00:01:23.020 --> 00:01:32.430
 We are researching advanced materials such as nanofibers 

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:36.300
 Nanofiber is a high-performance filter that does not pass any small artifacts 

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:42.050
 Demonstration of increased strength of chemical fibers and high performance clothing 

00:01:36.300 --> 00:01:45.650
 In addition , utilization is expected for the efficiency improvement of the next generation battery etc. 

00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:52.050
 Industry-academia collaboration is considered essential for commercialization 

00:01:45.650 --> 00:01:57.800
 I think that new industries will always be born by conducting industry-academia collaboration 

00:01:52.050 --> 00:02:03.670
 Faculty of Reliability Medicine researching world top level textile materials 

00:01:57.800 --> 00:02:03.670
 New materials are created from the latest facilities to create a bright future
