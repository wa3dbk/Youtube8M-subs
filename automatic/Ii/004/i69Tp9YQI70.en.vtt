00:05:19.720 --> 00:05:19.730 
sleepy but not that much because it's

00:05:19.730 --> 00:05:24.460 
sleepy but not that much because it's
spray<00:05:20.150> and<00:05:20.960> not<00:05:21.290> a<00:05:21.320> magic<00:05:21.680> wand<00:05:22.540> so<00:05:23.540> prefer

00:05:24.460 --> 00:05:24.470 
spray and not a magic wand so prefer

00:05:24.470 --> 00:05:28.900

using<00:05:25.130> a<00:05:25.990> rose<00:05:26.990> water<00:05:27.320> and<00:05:27.830> I<00:05:28.220> feel<00:05:28.520> like<00:05:28.730> the

00:05:28.900 --> 00:05:28.910 
using a rose water and I feel like the

00:05:28.910 --> 00:05:31.830 
using a rose water and I feel like the
rose<00:05:29.090> water<00:05:29.330> gives<00:05:29.720> the<00:05:29.870> same<00:05:30.460> sort<00:05:31.460> of

00:05:31.830 --> 00:05:31.840

freshness<00:05:32.840> like<00:05:33.380> this<00:05:33.650> does<00:05:33.920> and<00:05:34.250> I<00:05:35.090> think<00:05:35.360> it

00:05:35.440 --> 00:05:35.450 
freshness like this does and I think it

00:05:35.450 --> 00:05:37.090 
freshness like this does and I think it
does<00:05:35.600> the<00:05:35.690> pretty<00:05:35.960> much<00:05:36.170> the<00:05:36.260> same<00:05:36.440> thing<00:05:36.770> I'm
