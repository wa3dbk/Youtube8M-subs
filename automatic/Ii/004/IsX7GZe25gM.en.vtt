00:00:10.020 --> 00:00:19.289
 from chicken or reward 

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:22.589
 let's go to that for its preparation 

00:00:19.289 --> 00:00:26.390
 need half a kilo of pink 

00:00:22.589 --> 00:00:29.669
 bunch of green lettuce 

00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:31.949
 a pound of chicken fillet n need it 

00:00:29.669 --> 00:00:33.350
 pre-boil in salted 

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:36.260
 water and cool 

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:42.420
 also need half a pack of mayonnaise 

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:45.420
 salt and black pepper and so proceed 

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:49.230
 cooking this beautiful salad 

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:50.850
 as you can see I have already prepared something 

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:54.149
 lettuce leaves 

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:57.859
 they are already crushed can cut them 

00:00:54.149 --> 00:01:00.149
 knife but master of culinary art 

00:00:57.859 --> 00:01:03.210
 I affirm that it's better after all 

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:05.220
 tearing lettuce leaves with their hands then they 

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:09.119
 look more natural 

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:12.540
 and better so with the leaves of lettuce we 

00:01:09.119 --> 00:01:15.570
 finished also I already cut chicken 

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:27.060
 fillet cubes here it is now we are you 

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:34.759

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:39.409

00:01:34.759 --> 00:01:41.830
 grape and cut it in half 

00:01:39.409 --> 00:02:10.330
 like this 

00:01:41.830 --> 00:02:13.770
 the module so that our quantity 

00:02:10.330 --> 00:02:16.090
 grapes were about the same and 

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:19.360
 amount of chicken meat 

00:02:16.090 --> 00:02:22.980
 that's about it so let's see 

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:22.980

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:30.150
 mix and bright multicolored 

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:40.480
 intermixed now the only thing that we 

00:02:37.510 --> 00:02:41.530
 it remains to add salt to it pepper 

00:02:40.480 --> 00:02:44.520
