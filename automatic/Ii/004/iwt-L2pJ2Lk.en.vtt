you been thinking about going solar I

you been thinking about going solar I
understand<00:01:01.260> it's<00:01:01.379> been<00:01:01.500> a<00:01:01.530> while<00:01:01.789> well<00:01:02.789> yeah

00:01:02.869 --> 00:01:02.879

you<00:01:03.059> know<00:01:03.090> it's<00:01:03.300> been<00:01:03.480> in<00:01:03.600> the<00:01:03.660> back<00:01:03.780> of<00:01:03.960> my

00:01:04.009 --> 00:01:04.019 
you know it's been in the back of my

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:06.380 
you know it's been in the back of my
mind<00:01:04.170> we've<00:01:04.820> one<00:01:05.820> of<00:01:05.909> the<00:01:05.970> things<00:01:06.180> that<00:01:06.330> we

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:06.390 
mind we've one of the things that we

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:09.320 
mind we've one of the things that we
were<00:01:06.479> doing<00:01:06.630> is<00:01:06.869> it's<00:01:07.680> moving<00:01:08.100> so<00:01:08.520> much<00:01:08.760> and

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:09.330 
were doing is it's moving so much and

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:11.149 
were doing is it's moving so much and
he'd<00:01:09.510> know<00:01:09.750> when<00:01:09.960> we<00:01:10.140> when<00:01:10.830> I<00:01:10.890> was<00:01:11.010> playing

00:01:11.149 --> 00:01:11.159 
he'd know when we when I was playing

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:12.679 
he'd know when we when I was playing
basketball<00:01:11.670> we<00:01:11.970> were<00:01:12.060> traveling<00:01:12.479> I<00:01:12.570> was

00:01:12.679 --> 00:01:12.689 
basketball we were traveling I was

00:01:12.689 --> 00:01:15.580 
basketball we were traveling I was
really<00:01:12.990> focused<00:01:13.290> on<00:01:13.380> a<00:01:13.409> lot<00:01:13.590> of<00:01:13.619> other<00:01:13.799> things

00:01:15.580 --> 00:01:15.590 
really focused on a lot of other things

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:19.340 
really focused on a lot of other things
but<00:01:16.590> but<00:01:16.890> I've<00:01:16.979> always<00:01:17.340> thought<00:01:17.720> if<00:01:18.720> in<00:01:19.259> the

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:19.350 
but but I've always thought if in the

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:20.899 
but but I've always thought if in the
right<00:01:19.380> application<00:01:19.650> in<00:01:20.159> the<00:01:20.220> right<00:01:20.369> situation

00:01:20.899 --> 00:01:20.909 
right application in the right situation

00:01:20.909 --> 00:01:22.580 
right application in the right situation
I'd<00:01:21.000> love<00:01:21.240> that<00:01:21.270> to<00:01:21.600> look<00:01:21.960> into<00:01:22.229> that<00:01:22.320> further

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:22.590 
I'd love that to look into that further

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:26.840 
I'd love that to look into that further
and<00:01:22.979> when<00:01:23.700> we<00:01:23.820> built<00:01:24.030> this<00:01:24.150> house<00:01:25.520> three<00:01:26.520> three

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:26.850 
and when we built this house three three

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:30.170 
and when we built this house three three
and<00:01:26.880> a<00:01:26.970> half<00:01:27.060> years<00:01:27.299> ago<00:01:27.360> I<00:01:27.799> looked<00:01:28.799> into<00:01:29.180> doing

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:30.180 
and a half years ago I looked into doing

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:33.499 
and a half years ago I looked into doing
a<00:01:30.240> solar<00:01:30.450> system<00:01:30.720> and<00:01:31.430> at<00:01:32.430> the<00:01:32.610> time<00:01:32.939> it<00:01:33.270> still

00:01:33.499 --> 00:01:33.509 
a solar system and at the time it still

00:01:33.509 --> 00:01:36.380 
a solar system and at the time it still
wasn't<00:01:34.310> programs<00:01:35.310> just<00:01:35.549> weren't<00:01:35.700> there<00:01:35.970> to

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:36.390 
wasn't programs just weren't there to

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:37.940 
wasn't programs just weren't there to
make<00:01:36.570> it<00:01:36.600> cost-effective<00:01:36.990> because<00:01:37.710> it

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:37.950 
make it cost-effective because it

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:39.649 
make it cost-effective because it
because<00:01:38.159> it<00:01:38.310> can<00:01:38.520> be<00:01:38.700> very<00:01:38.729> expensive<00:01:39.150> but

00:01:39.649 --> 00:01:39.659 
because it can be very expensive but

00:01:39.659 --> 00:01:41.780 
because it can be very expensive but
people<00:01:40.140> research<00:01:40.500> to<00:01:40.740> look<00:01:41.009> at<00:01:41.189> look<00:01:41.430> into<00:01:41.700> it

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:41.790 
people research to look at look into it

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:43.219 
people research to look at look into it
further<00:01:41.970> there<00:01:42.270> there<00:01:42.479> are<00:01:42.630> ways<00:01:42.810> that<00:01:42.840> that

00:01:43.219 --> 00:01:43.229 
further there there are ways that that

00:01:43.229 --> 00:01:45.050 
further there there are ways that that
make<00:01:43.409> it<00:01:43.590> especially<00:01:44.100> long-term<00:01:44.640> very

00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:45.060 
make it especially long-term very

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:48.020 
make it especially long-term very
affordable<00:01:45.570> I<00:01:45.810> ran<00:01:46.140> into<00:01:46.320> a<00:01:47.130> company<00:01:47.850> called

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:48.030 
affordable I ran into a company called

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:50.280 
affordable I ran into a company called
solar<00:01:48.149> tech<00:01:48.450> not<00:01:48.659> too<00:01:48.780> long<00:01:48.930> ago<00:01:48.990> and

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:50.290 
solar tech not too long ago and

00:01:50.290 --> 00:01:53.340 
solar tech not too long ago and
Adam<00:01:50.590> and<00:01:50.710> I<00:01:50.740> were<00:01:50.890> talking<00:01:51.280> and<00:01:51.430> and<00:01:52.320> he<00:01:53.320> said

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:53.350 
Adam and I were talking and and he said

00:01:53.350 --> 00:01:55.430 
Adam and I were talking and and he said
look<00:01:53.680> this<00:01:53.890> is<00:01:54.100> the<00:01:54.220> situation<00:01:54.760> about<00:01:54.820> the<00:01:54.970> UVA

00:01:55.430 --> 00:01:55.440 
look this is the situation about the UVA

00:01:55.440 --> 00:01:58.410 
look this is the situation about the UVA
presentation<00:01:56.440> I'm<00:01:56.740> like<00:01:56.920> fantastic<00:01:57.790> with<00:01:57.910> I'm

00:01:58.410 --> 00:01:58.420

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:00.820 
here and and I like what I heard did a

00:02:00.820 --> 00:02:03.870 
here and and I like what I heard did a
bunch<00:02:00.970> of<00:02:01.090> research<00:02:01.240> and<00:02:01.750> and<00:02:02.290> thought<00:02:02.880> let's

00:02:03.870 --> 00:02:03.880 
bunch of research and and thought let's

00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:05.430 
bunch of research and and thought let's
try<00:02:04.120> it<00:02:04.180> let's<00:02:04.480> do<00:02:04.720> it

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:05.440 
try it let's do it

00:02:05.440 --> 00:02:09.150 
try it let's do it
if<00:02:05.950> it<00:02:06.100> works<00:02:06.310> the<00:02:06.460> way<00:02:07.350> it's<00:02:08.350> presented<00:02:08.560> then

00:02:09.150 --> 00:02:09.160 
if it works the way it's presented then

00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:11.760 
if it works the way it's presented then
it's<00:02:09.610> a<00:02:09.700> no-brainer<00:02:09.850> for<00:02:10.210> me<00:02:10.360> so<00:02:10.869> and<00:02:11.380> how<00:02:11.620> is

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:23.590 
want to put a solar system on for the

00:02:23.590 --> 00:02:25.680 
want to put a solar system on for the
sake<00:02:23.770> of<00:02:23.800> putting<00:02:24.130> a<00:02:24.190> solar<00:02:24.370> system<00:02:24.760> on

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:25.690 
sake of putting a solar system on

00:02:25.690 --> 00:02:27.960 
sake of putting a solar system on
yeah<00:02:26.650> I've<00:02:26.800> run<00:02:27.010> for<00:02:27.160> political<00:02:27.250> office<00:02:27.610> I

the environment I want it to be I want

00:02:38.470 --> 00:02:39.780 
the environment I want it to be I want
us<00:02:38.530> to<00:02:38.650> take<00:02:38.830> better<00:02:38.950> care<00:02:39.280> of<00:02:39.340> it<00:02:39.430> than<00:02:39.550> we<00:02:39.670> are

us to take better care of it than we are

00:02:39.790 --> 00:02:41.729 
us to take better care of it than we are
because<00:02:39.850> we<00:02:40.120> need<00:02:40.990> to<00:02:41.110> drastically<00:02:41.650> improve

because we need to drastically improve

00:02:41.739 --> 00:02:44.490 
because we need to drastically improve
in<00:02:42.220> that<00:02:42.370> venue<00:02:43.120> but<00:02:43.480> if<00:02:43.900> it<00:02:44.110> didn't<00:02:44.380> work

00:02:44.490 --> 00:02:44.500 
in that venue but if it didn't work

then<00:02:49.209> then<00:02:50.020> I<00:02:50.200> was<00:02:50.440> standing<00:02:51.370> back<00:02:51.550> a<00:02:51.580> little

00:02:51.870 --> 00:02:51.880 
then then I was standing back a little

00:02:51.880 --> 00:02:53.850 
then then I was standing back a little
bit<00:02:52.090> and<00:02:52.330> and<00:02:52.750> when<00:02:52.930> it<00:02:53.020> started<00:02:53.320> working<00:02:53.500> on

on all fronts in a positive way I

00:02:55.989 --> 00:03:02.449 
on all fronts in a positive way I
thought<00:02:56.290> well<00:02:56.530> that<00:02:57.250> I<00:02:57.280> can<00:02:57.790> become<00:02:58.000> a<00:02:58.030> part

don't have to worry about it they come
in<00:05:51.130> and<00:05:51.280> it's<00:05:51.340> for<00:05:52.030> signatures<00:05:52.479> and<00:05:52.660> the

00:05:52.950 --> 00:05:52.960 
in and it's for signatures and the

00:05:52.960 --> 00:05:54.870 
in and it's for signatures and the
feedback<00:05:53.169> is<00:05:53.500> well<00:05:53.680> this<00:05:53.800> is<00:05:53.860> this<00:05:54.550> is<00:05:54.729> too
