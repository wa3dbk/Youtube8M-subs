00:01:12.149 --> 00:01:12.159 
immediate area one thing that people

00:01:12.159 --> 00:01:14.190 
immediate area one thing that people
should<00:01:12.310> think<00:01:12.520> about<00:01:12.640> before<00:01:13.360> they<00:01:13.720> sign<00:01:13.960> that

00:01:14.190 --> 00:01:14.200 
should think about before they sign that

00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:16.469 
should think about before they sign that
lease<00:01:14.409> is<00:01:14.740> that<00:01:15.430> they<00:01:15.580> need<00:01:15.610> to<00:01:15.880> understand

00:01:16.469 --> 00:01:16.479 
lease is that they need to understand

00:01:16.479 --> 00:01:19.080 
lease is that they need to understand
everything<00:01:17.260> there<00:01:17.860> is<00:01:17.890> about<00:01:18.040> the<00:01:18.549> process

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:19.090 
everything there is about the process

00:01:19.090 --> 00:01:20.820 
everything there is about the process
and<00:01:19.270> that's<00:01:19.750> something<00:01:20.020> that's<00:01:20.260> been<00:01:20.530> lacking

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:20.830 
and that's something that's been lacking

00:01:20.830 --> 00:01:22.649 
and that's something that's been lacking
they<00:01:21.520> don't<00:01:21.700> fully<00:01:21.880> understand<00:01:22.360> what<00:01:22.509> it<00:01:22.630> is

00:01:22.649 --> 00:01:22.659 
they don't fully understand what it is

00:01:22.659 --> 00:01:25.920 
they don't fully understand what it is
that<00:01:22.750> they're<00:01:23.049> signing<00:01:23.380> and<00:01:24.240> it's<00:01:25.240> taken<00:01:25.720> me<00:01:25.900> a

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:25.930 
that they're signing and it's taken me a

00:01:25.930 --> 00:01:27.780 
that they're signing and it's taken me a
number<00:01:26.290> of<00:01:26.590> years<00:01:26.799> to<00:01:27.189> get<00:01:27.310> the<00:01:27.490> education

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:27.790 
number of years to get the education

00:01:27.790 --> 00:01:31.140 
number of years to get the education
that<00:01:28.390> I<00:01:28.869> needed<00:01:29.259> to<00:01:29.439> really<00:01:29.860> make<00:01:30.150> decisions

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:31.150 
that I needed to really make decisions

00:01:31.150 --> 00:01:34.080 
that I needed to really make decisions
on<00:01:31.360> this<00:01:31.600> and<00:01:31.900> a<00:01:32.740> lot<00:01:33.280> of<00:01:33.340> people<00:01:33.729> who<00:01:34.000> are

00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:34.090 
on this and a lot of people who are

00:01:34.090 --> 00:01:35.249 
on this and a lot of people who are
assigned<00:01:34.270> at<00:01:34.479> least<00:01:34.630> you<00:01:34.720> simply<00:01:35.049> don't<00:01:35.170> have

00:01:35.249 --> 00:01:35.259 
assigned at least you simply don't have

00:01:35.259 --> 00:01:38.640 
assigned at least you simply don't have
time<00:01:35.560> to<00:01:35.740> do<00:01:35.860> that<00:01:36.090> and<00:01:37.090> so<00:01:37.540> education<00:01:38.530> is

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:38.650 
time to do that and so education is

00:01:38.650 --> 00:01:41.310 
time to do that and so education is
extremely<00:01:39.280> important<00:01:39.759> for<00:01:39.970> someone<00:01:40.780> who's

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:41.320 
extremely important for someone who's

00:01:41.320 --> 00:01:42.600 
extremely important for someone who's
going<00:01:41.439> to<00:01:41.500> sign<00:01:41.710> a<00:01:41.740> lease<00:01:41.979> and<00:01:42.189> people<00:01:42.430> need<00:01:42.549> to

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:42.610 
going to sign a lease and people need to

00:01:42.610 --> 00:01:44.399 
going to sign a lease and people need to
understand<00:01:43.150> the<00:01:43.240> magnitude<00:01:43.479> of<00:01:43.930> signing<00:01:44.290> that

00:01:44.399 --> 00:01:44.409 
understand the magnitude of signing that

00:01:44.409 --> 00:01:47.370 
understand the magnitude of signing that
lease<00:01:44.700> you're<00:01:45.700> signing<00:01:46.329> away<00:01:46.600> part<00:01:47.170> of<00:01:47.320> your

going into the ground to get the

00:01:53.229 --> 00:01:54.630 
going into the ground to get the
minerals<00:01:53.439> there's<00:01:53.890> going<00:01:54.040> to<00:01:54.100> be<00:01:54.130> things<00:01:54.399> on

minerals there's going to be things on
the<00:01:54.759> surface<00:01:55.149> and<00:01:55.360> and<00:01:55.960> I<00:01:56.079> don't<00:01:56.259> think<00:01:56.470> people

00:01:56.639 --> 00:01:56.649 
the surface and and I don't think people

00:01:56.649 --> 00:01:58.679 
the surface and and I don't think people
fully<00:01:56.979> understand<00:01:57.549> they<00:01:58.000> think<00:01:58.299> that<00:01:58.479> there's

00:01:58.679 --> 00:01:58.689 
fully understand they think that there's

00:01:58.689 --> 00:02:01.560 
fully understand they think that there's
going<00:01:59.020> to<00:01:59.140> be<00:01:59.170> a<00:01:59.500> fire<00:02:00.430> hydrant<00:02:00.729> sticking<00:02:01.420> up

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:01.570 
going to be a fire hydrant sticking up

00:02:01.570 --> 00:02:03.630

00:02:06.749 --> 00:02:06.759 
opposed to having a you know a five acre

00:02:06.759 --> 00:02:10.770

pad site with 10 tanks or something of
the<00:02:10.810> sorts<00:02:11.170> and<00:02:11.380> so<00:02:11.950> I<00:02:11.980> think<00:02:12.130> the<00:02:12.430> key<00:02:12.730> thing

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:12.760 
the sorts and so I think the key thing

00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:14.670 
the sorts and so I think the key thing
is<00:02:13.030> is<00:02:13.360> that<00:02:13.480> people<00:02:13.900> need<00:02:14.050> to<00:02:14.140> get<00:02:14.260> educated

00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:14.680 
is is that people need to get educated

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:17.610 
is is that people need to get educated
on<00:02:14.950> the<00:02:15.760> process<00:02:16.300> someone<00:02:16.989> likes<00:02:17.170> citizen

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:17.620 
on the process someone likes citizen

00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:19.150 
on the process someone likes citizen

shale advisors

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:22.240 
shale advisors

would possibly fill the role of that
education<00:02:22.990> and<00:02:24.250> help<00:02:25.250> someone<00:02:26.260> understand

advantage of you can cut the the the
learning<00:02:50.780> process<00:02:50.930> down<00:02:51.380> considerably<00:02:52.060> you

00:02:53.050 --> 00:02:53.060 
learning process down considerably you

through this process and you know that's

00:02:55.040 --> 00:02:57.490 
through this process and you know that's
going<00:02:55.220> to<00:02:55.310> help<00:02:55.460> add<00:02:55.730> to<00:02:56.060> your<00:02:56.570> pocketbook<00:02:57.170> for
