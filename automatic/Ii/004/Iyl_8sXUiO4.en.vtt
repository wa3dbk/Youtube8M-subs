00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:53.180 
an expert on an amount of hair we're
gonna<00:00:51.870> do<00:00:52.050> something<00:00:52.379> that's<00:00:52.559> like<00:00:52.770> a<00:00:53.010> little

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:53.190 
gonna do something that's like a little

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:55.490 
gonna do something that's like a little
bit<00:00:53.400> more<00:00:53.520> of<00:00:53.610> a<00:00:53.670> grungy<00:00:54.000> style<00:00:54.270> Bob<00:00:54.449> I<00:00:54.629> think

00:00:55.490 --> 00:00:55.500 
bit more of a grungy style Bob I think

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:57.229 
bit more of a grungy style Bob I think
that's<00:00:55.770> very<00:00:55.829> relevant<00:00:56.070> at<00:00:56.370> the<00:00:56.430> moment<00:00:56.460> and

00:00:57.229 --> 00:00:57.239 
that's very relevant at the moment and

00:00:57.239 --> 00:00:58.400 
that's very relevant at the moment and
it's<00:00:57.450> a<00:00:57.480> very<00:00:57.660> simple<00:00:57.840> technique<00:00:58.050> it's

00:00:58.400 --> 00:00:58.410 
it's a very simple technique it's

00:00:58.410 --> 00:00:59.569 
it's a very simple technique it's
something<00:00:58.650> that<00:00:58.770> we<00:00:58.829> use<00:00:58.860> a<00:00:58.950> lot<00:00:59.040> in<00:00:59.160> the<00:00:59.340> sand

00:00:59.569 --> 00:00:59.579 
something that we use a lot in the sand

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:00.800 
something that we use a lot in the sand
which<00:00:59.700> is<00:00:59.730> really<00:01:00.060> relevant<00:01:00.300> to<00:01:00.510> everybody

00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:00.810 
which is really relevant to everybody

00:01:00.810 --> 00:01:03.470 
which is really relevant to everybody
watching<00:01:01.380> it's<00:01:01.860> a<00:01:01.980> technique<00:01:02.360> when<00:01:03.360> you're

00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:03.480 
watching it's a technique when you're

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:04.790 
watching it's a technique when you're
working<00:01:03.750> with<00:01:03.840> this<00:01:03.930> amount<00:01:04.170> of<00:01:04.320> hair<00:01:04.559> that<00:01:04.739> if

00:01:04.790 --> 00:01:04.800 
working with this amount of hair that if

00:01:04.800 --> 00:01:06.200 
working with this amount of hair that if
you<00:01:04.890> reduce<00:01:05.309> some<00:01:05.339> of<00:01:05.610> the<00:01:05.729> hair<00:01:05.880> in<00:01:05.970> some

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:06.210 
you reduce some of the hair in some

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:07.880 
you reduce some of the hair in some
places<00:01:06.450> because<00:01:07.050> otherwise<00:01:07.380> she's<00:01:07.680> going<00:01:07.800> to

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:07.890 
places because otherwise she's going to

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:09.380 
places because otherwise she's going to
end<00:01:08.009> up<00:01:08.070> looking<00:01:08.670> like<00:01:08.700> she's<00:01:08.910> wearing<00:01:09.149> a<00:01:09.240> wig

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:09.390 
end up looking like she's wearing a wig

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:11.870 
end up looking like she's wearing a wig
right<00:01:09.990> yeah<00:01:10.560> so<00:01:11.160> what<00:01:11.399> we<00:01:11.490> have<00:01:11.580> to<00:01:11.670> do<00:01:11.790> is

00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:11.880 
right yeah so what we have to do is

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:14.420 
right yeah so what we have to do is
flatten<00:01:12.270> some<00:01:12.930> of<00:01:13.050> the<00:01:13.110> sections<00:01:13.590> out<00:01:13.800> from

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:14.430 
flatten some of the sections out from

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:16.400 
flatten some of the sections out from
underneath<00:01:14.700> first<00:01:15.180> so<00:01:15.780> that<00:01:15.930> the<00:01:16.020> top<00:01:16.229> can

00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:16.410 
underneath first so that the top can

00:01:16.410 --> 00:01:22.179 
underneath first so that the top can
move<00:01:16.560> a<00:01:16.649> little<00:01:16.740> bit<00:01:16.979> more<00:01:17.540> we're<00:01:18.540> just<00:01:18.869> gonna

00:01:22.179 --> 00:01:22.189 

00:01:22.189 --> 00:01:25.120 

reduce<00:01:22.909> the<00:01:23.090> hair<00:01:23.360> right<00:01:24.259> at<00:01:24.500> the<00:01:24.590> bottom<00:01:24.920> for

00:01:25.120 --> 00:01:25.130 
reduce the hair right at the bottom for

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:27.039 
reduce the hair right at the bottom for
that<00:01:25.219> shape<00:01:25.430> into<00:01:25.759> the<00:01:25.850> bottom<00:01:26.180> no<00:01:26.780> all<00:01:26.899> I'm

00:01:27.039 --> 00:01:27.049

00:01:27.049 --> 00:01:29.289 
that shape into the bottom no all I'm
doing<00:01:27.350> is<00:01:27.469> using<00:01:27.530> it<00:01:27.920> as<00:01:27.979> a<00:01:28.009> comb<00:01:28.340> so<00:01:29.060> I'm<00:01:29.149> not

00:02:08.919 --> 00:02:08.929 
center and take off the curve so we're

00:02:08.929 --> 00:02:10.089 
center and take off the curve so we're
