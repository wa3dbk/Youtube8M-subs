 pro-cnt have limpid it's a 

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:35.760
 quite open test now he 

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:38.219
 seems to be a good point of support with 

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:40.230
 the number 1 silver axis that has already shown 

00:00:38.219 --> 00:00:41.100
 its quality repeatedly it gets 

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:44.489
 please on this course 

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:45.989
 well it's their axis we understood it is 

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:47.879
 the vote big cats with long shadow 

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:50.039
 favorite now we are waiting for your 

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:52.980
 complete selection so the number 1 

00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:55.829
 silver axes number 9 at pigalle the 2nd 

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:58.020
 rima bad the 5 winner moves the eleven 

00:00:55.829 --> 00:01:00.890
 glottis on 15 malak al hawa 

00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:04.229
 leucate marvel flight and the sparky say 

00:01:00.890 --> 00:01:05.790
 so the silver axis is your 

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:07.470
 favorite grandissime he goes down from 

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:09.540
 7th grade of the rhone waters of the fishpond 

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:11.100
 it's the integral basis actually the 

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:13.799
 renaud du vivier prize is a classic 

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:15.119
 a group 1 he finished 7th certainly he 

00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:16.500
 was not threatening but it's a 

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:18.360
 a much higher test than the one 

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:19.770
 it has already proven itself to this 

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:21.479
 level of multi-competition 

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:23.070
 times this year he did not win 

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:24.509
 but he deserves it he likes to 

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:25.020
 Cagnes-sur-Mer two wins in three 

00:01:24.509 --> 00:01:26.700
 attempts 

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:27.810
 if he had not fallen in the big 

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:29.700
 4 year hurdles race we would have 

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:31.850
 certainly gained his aptitude to 

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:33.869
 course is not defective 

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:36.329
 patricia butel presents her 

00:01:33.869 --> 00:01:36.720
 boarders here even often a good 

00:01:36.329 --> 00:01:39.600
 advisedly 

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:40.650
 there in the last three editions his 

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:42.780
 boarders made the finish 

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:44.250
 so he should normally fight for 

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:45.329
 the first places silver axis same 

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:47.579
 if it is to give weight back all its 

00:01:45.329 --> 00:01:49.259
 opponents but hey he makes 3 kg to 

00:01:47.579 --> 00:01:51.390
 other adage is that when in a 

00:01:49.259 --> 00:01:52.649
 handicap in addition to weight to his 

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:54.299
 opponents is that we downgraded 

00:01:52.649 --> 00:01:55.799
 which you talked about patricia butel 

00:01:54.299 --> 00:01:59.240
 that's good it's our minute on the ground 

00:01:55.799 --> 00:01:59.240
 gille ointment went to meet him 

00:01:59.479 --> 00:02:04.979
 patricia butel you will present if 

00:02:02.189 --> 00:02:08.580
 their axis in the quintÃ© of Wednesday to 

00:02:04.979 --> 00:02:09.840
 cagnes-sur-mer the horse comes down from 

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:15.180
 category this time it will be 

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:22.170
 certainly easier for him to 

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:23.790
 up bearing for so they complicate 

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:24.750
 are numerous who handicaps sequence 

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:31.050
 difficult 

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:32.459
 yes good it was moderately good 

00:02:31.050 --> 00:02:33.660
 that he has it in quotation marks everything 

00:02:32.459 --> 00:02:35.549
 to please because it's doing very well 

00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:37.230
 that he showed he was very 

00:02:35.549 --> 00:02:40.290
 competitive in this kind of race 

00:02:37.230 --> 00:02:44.489
 yes here he has the deputies curiously 

00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:46.590
 last year in cannes he had 

00:02:44.489 --> 00:02:48.599
 reiterated at covanta in the shot but in 

00:02:46.590 --> 00:02:50.370
 the hall at the last but one for the 

00:02:48.599 --> 00:02:53.280
 last collection sponsorship 

00:02:50.370 --> 00:02:54.480
 yes then he would have taken a share 

00:02:53.280 --> 00:03:02.450
 active on arrival also 

00:02:54.480 --> 00:03:02.450
 - yes normally his form and years 

00:03:03.810 --> 00:03:07.810
 the arrival a priori all fires are at 

00:03:07.630 --> 00:03:09.280
 green 

00:03:07.810 --> 00:03:11.140
 now it should be 

00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:13.150
 goes well and normally there should 

00:03:11.140 --> 00:03:14.980
 resume present good anyway the 

00:03:13.150 --> 00:03:17.200
 integral base it is far silver access 

00:03:14.980 --> 00:03:18.910
 wanted to contrast the 9 to pigalle him comes 

00:03:17.200 --> 00:03:20.950
 to finish at a neckline of did you see 

00:03:18.910 --> 00:03:22.720
 deniaud who repeated since the line is 

00:03:20.950 --> 00:03:23.890
 perfect so actually it's a 

00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:25.510
 concrete line plus it's a 

00:03:23.890 --> 00:03:27.700
 competitor who has progressed a lot 

00:03:25.510 --> 00:03:30.310
 for several weeks evolving in 

00:03:27.700 --> 00:03:31.569
 effect in a claim this time he has 

00:03:30.310 --> 00:03:33.400
 shone in the events at his 

00:03:31.569 --> 00:03:36.010
 last two attempts he found 

00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:37.930
 this category here he has been ahead of dream to 

00:03:36.010 --> 00:03:39.580
 ba2 the number 2 which I will speak to you 

00:03:37.930 --> 00:03:41.860
 then by twenty lengths in the month 

00:03:39.580 --> 00:03:43.150
 of October subject on this line knowing 

00:03:41.860 --> 00:03:44.170
 that he finds his rival in 

00:03:43.150 --> 00:03:46.030
 best weight conditions 

00:03:44.170 --> 00:03:47.410
 he should logically answer this 

00:03:46.030 --> 00:03:49.090
 he is still provided with blinkers which 

00:03:47.410 --> 00:03:51.130
 he does well and bertrand lestrade 

00:03:49.090 --> 00:03:52.209
 did it well lately and so 

00:03:51.130 --> 00:03:54.850
 all the reasons to believe it 

00:03:52.209 --> 00:03:56.860
 as good we want to go to the counter 

00:03:54.850 --> 00:03:58.750
 in any case with all these arguments the 

00:03:56.860 --> 00:03:59.920
 two masts dream amazon talk to him 

00:03:58.750 --> 00:04:01.390
 rest on two wins this is at 

00:03:59.920 --> 00:04:01.810
 ask for a shot he climbs a bit of 

00:04:01.390 --> 00:04:03.580
 category 

00:04:01.810 --> 00:04:05.110
 it is true that he climbs the category 

00:04:03.580 --> 00:04:07.120
 price in 59 worth what it is 

00:04:05.110 --> 00:04:08.140
 never easy when we start at this 

00:04:07.120 --> 00:04:09.610
 level of competition 

00:04:08.140 --> 00:04:10.989
 however there is marie porzier 

00:04:09.610 --> 00:04:12.400
 made the move it's his 

00:04:10.989 --> 00:04:13.480
 first starter since the beginning of 

00:04:12.400 --> 00:04:15.160
 winter meeting of cagnes 

00:04:13.480 --> 00:04:17.260
 if he comes here it's certainly because 

00:04:15.160 --> 00:04:19.209
 that he has ambitions besides he does not 

00:04:17.260 --> 00:04:21.609
 not especially afraid of the 59 worth 

00:04:19.209 --> 00:04:23.020
 nor the 67 kg that are attributed to his 

00:04:21.609 --> 00:04:24.580
 boarder he is totally 

00:04:23.020 --> 00:04:25.990
 transformed since he arrived at 

00:04:24.580 --> 00:04:26.380
 yann marie porzier besides this dream 

00:04:25.990 --> 00:04:27.669
 abad 

00:04:26.380 --> 00:04:29.410
 he continues the good performances 

00:04:27.669 --> 00:04:30.940
 certainly in the ads and appears 

00:04:29.410 --> 00:04:33.340
 able to do well from the outset 

00:04:30.940 --> 00:04:34.990
 the strong one in the form still plays a 

00:04:33.340 --> 00:04:37.870
 essential role at this time of the year 

00:04:34.990 --> 00:04:39.490
 but it's true that it can 

00:04:37.870 --> 00:04:40.960
 can fill that little flat that the 

00:04:39.490 --> 00:04:42.400
 world class horse yes and then 

00:04:40.960 --> 00:04:44.110
 we saw residents of yann-marie 

00:04:42.400 --> 00:04:46.090
 porzier do good things 

00:04:44.110 --> 00:04:47.440
 progress including sweety hillsides which 

00:04:46.090 --> 00:04:48.640
 was part of the advertisements and that shone 

00:04:47.440 --> 00:04:51.010
 to continue in a beautiful race to 

00:04:48.640 --> 00:04:52.570
 conditions so it's a blow 

00:04:51.010 --> 00:04:53.260
 interesting would be sick I think in 

00:04:52.570 --> 00:04:55.870
 this price from london 

00:04:53.260 --> 00:04:57.850
 we will see each other the number of 

00:04:55.870 --> 00:04:59.620
 seats over it a little closer 

00:04:57.850 --> 00:05:00.880
 it does not worry you, not really 

00:04:59.620 --> 00:05:02.440
 they have just behaved very well 

00:05:00.880 --> 00:05:04.360
 this level of competition ranking 

00:05:02.440 --> 00:05:06.130
 fourth he was facing his elders this 

00:05:04.360 --> 00:05:06.910
 day there the distance was a little more 

00:05:06.130 --> 00:05:08.410
 long but I think the 

00:05:06.910 --> 00:05:10.360
 shortening is not going to bother him 

00:05:08.410 --> 00:05:12.099
 he confronts only his contemporaries 

00:05:10.360 --> 00:05:12.990
 and this time kevin nabet know him 

00:05:12.099 --> 00:05:14.850
 well 

00:05:12.990 --> 00:05:16.320
 the inca green to progress too he 

00:05:14.850 --> 00:05:17.640
 should logically do well 

00:05:16.320 --> 00:05:18.840
 especially as the resident of yannick 

00:05:17.640 --> 00:05:19.380
 nosy they are in shape from the beginning 

00:05:18.840 --> 00:05:21.660
 of winter 

00:05:19.380 --> 00:05:23.610
 that we saw one of the barrels and the first 

00:05:21.660 --> 00:05:25.200
 full board meeting day so here 

00:05:23.610 --> 00:05:27.000
 the only minor places it is 

00:05:25.200 --> 00:05:29.520
 able to still do well I think 

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:30.810
 for his training good so in everything 

00:05:29.520 --> 00:05:33.810
 case the unique workout always make 

00:05:30.810 --> 00:05:35.220
 formidable at the meeting of cagnes in 

00:05:33.810 --> 00:05:36.840
 obstacle the 11 

00:05:35.220 --> 00:05:39.810
 what about the lot is a bit your whole 

00:05:36.840 --> 00:05:41.610
 your outsiders it's also a furnace 

00:05:39.810 --> 00:05:43.320
 exactly this is one of the strengths of 

00:05:41.610 --> 00:05:44.370
 yannick once in this event it's a 

00:05:43.320 --> 00:05:46.350
 competitor who come from very well 

00:05:44.370 --> 00:05:47.580
 completed at auteuil and at the beginning of the month 

00:05:46.350 --> 00:05:49.020
 was very far during the course is 

00:05:47.580 --> 00:05:51.150
 become finished 3rd close to 

00:05:49.020 --> 00:05:52.680
 democracy it's a filly everything to 

00:05:51.150 --> 00:05:54.030
 does valid democracy that goes 

00:05:52.680 --> 00:05:56.880
 certainly one day win his 

00:05:54.030 --> 00:05:58.140
 event normally here they shots of 

00:05:56.880 --> 00:06:00.090
 glottis he has the means to do well 

00:05:58.140 --> 00:06:01.500
 especially that the color plots him 

00:06:00.090 --> 00:06:02.850
 well like he is already doing 

00:06:01.500 --> 00:06:04.950
 come here to cagnes-sur-mer on this 

00:06:02.850 --> 00:06:06.360
 fast track he should do well I 

00:06:04.950 --> 00:06:09.300
 think it's a very good outsider in 

00:06:06.360 --> 00:06:10.980
 good effect in any case we will keep secret 

00:06:09.300 --> 00:06:12.570
 glottis well a single case not a lot 

00:06:10.980 --> 00:06:13.920
 experience but that's the same 

00:06:12.570 --> 00:06:15.510
 you worry and not at all because 

00:06:13.920 --> 00:06:17.160
 that he had already run an event 

00:06:15.510 --> 00:06:18.180
 it was in November much more 

00:06:17.160 --> 00:06:19.500
 raised to rank ninth 

00:06:18.180 --> 00:06:20.430
 you have not found it ridiculous 

00:06:19.500 --> 00:06:21.720
 that day he was really missing 

00:06:20.430 --> 00:06:23.220
 of experience he only had a few 

00:06:21.720 --> 00:06:25.740
 meter races this time he took 

00:06:23.220 --> 00:06:27.480
 two races of maturity since that's going 

00:06:25.740 --> 00:06:28.980
 do him the greatest good I think 

00:06:27.480 --> 00:06:30.240
 at the end of a favorable course he 

00:06:28.980 --> 00:06:31.770
 can answer this 

00:06:30.240 --> 00:06:33.450
 the only doubt I have in fact his regard 

00:06:31.770 --> 00:06:34.650
 it's his way of running because a 

00:06:33.450 --> 00:06:36.540
 cagnes sur mer we see from the beginning 

00:06:34.650 --> 00:06:37.350
 of the meeting which is not easy to
