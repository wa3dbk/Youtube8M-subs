00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:18.070 
first day of having them so I started

00:00:18.070 --> 00:00:20.550 
first day of having them so I started
with<00:00:18.220> a<00:00:18.250> microclimate<00:00:19.140> before<00:00:20.140> I<00:00:20.170> set<00:00:20.410> up<00:00:20.529> my

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:20.560 
with a microclimate before I set up my

00:00:20.560 --> 00:00:23.730 
with a microclimate before I set up my
box<00:00:20.890> my<00:00:21.699> Bruder<00:00:22.060> box<00:00:22.270> had<00:00:23.230> them<00:00:23.350> in<00:00:23.410> this<00:00:23.529> box

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:23.740 
box my Bruder box had them in this box

00:00:23.740 --> 00:00:25.290 
box my Bruder box had them in this box
but<00:00:24.010> I<00:00:24.039> knew<00:00:24.189> they'd<00:00:24.340> outgrow<00:00:24.820> that<00:00:24.850> within

00:00:25.290 --> 00:00:25.300 
but I knew they'd outgrow that within

00:00:25.300 --> 00:00:28.830 
but I knew they'd outgrow that within
probably<00:00:25.720> a<00:00:25.900> week<00:00:26.080> so<00:00:26.650> I<00:00:26.890> built<00:00:27.220> this<00:00:27.840> larger

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:28.840 
probably a week so I built this larger

00:00:28.840 --> 00:00:31.759 
probably a week so I built this larger
brooder<00:00:29.289> box<00:00:29.380> out<00:00:30.039> of<00:00:30.220> scrap<00:00:30.490> wood<00:00:30.519> today<00:00:31.150> I

00:00:31.759 --> 00:00:31.769 
brooder box out of scrap wood today I

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:34.170 
brooder box out of scrap wood today I
have<00:00:32.769> it<00:00:32.920> divided<00:00:33.280> off<00:00:33.550> because<00:00:33.879> they<00:00:34.000> don't

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:34.180 
have it divided off because they don't

00:00:34.180 --> 00:00:35.910 
have it divided off because they don't
need<00:00:34.360> that<00:00:34.660> much<00:00:34.870> space<00:00:35.019> it's<00:00:35.440> just<00:00:35.710> far<00:00:35.860> too

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:35.920

00:00:41.459 --> 00:00:41.469 
that's draft-free so you need high walls

00:00:41.469 --> 00:00:44.010 
that's draft-free so you need high walls

for betting I have news paper and

00:00:53.620 --> 00:00:56.010 
for betting I have news paper and

easily slip in and out in essence a
brooder<00:01:00.309> provides<00:01:00.789> a<00:01:01.090> few<00:01:01.719> essentials<00:01:02.289> it's<00:01:03.100> a

00:01:03.209 --> 00:01:03.219 
brooder provides a few essentials it's a

00:01:03.219 --> 00:01:05.310 
brooder provides a few essentials it's a
microclimate<00:01:03.699> that<00:01:04.119> prevents<00:01:04.780> drafts<00:01:05.080> by

00:01:05.310 --> 00:01:05.320 
microclimate that prevents drafts by

00:01:05.320 --> 00:01:08.359 
microclimate that prevents drafts by
having<00:01:05.649> high<00:01:06.550> walls<00:01:06.850> it<00:01:07.840> also<00:01:07.990> provides

00:01:08.359 --> 00:01:08.369 
having high walls it also provides

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:11.250 
having high walls it also provides
steady<00:01:09.369> temperature<00:01:09.909> that<00:01:10.720> fluctuates

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:11.260 
steady temperature that fluctuates

00:01:11.260 --> 00:01:13.230 
steady temperature that fluctuates
between<00:01:11.409> about<00:01:11.770> 95<00:01:12.310> degrees<00:01:12.640> Fahrenheit<00:01:13.119> and

00:01:13.230 --> 00:01:13.240 
between about 95 degrees Fahrenheit and

00:01:13.240 --> 00:01:16.320 
between about 95 degrees Fahrenheit and
75<00:01:14.200> degrees<00:01:14.530> Fahrenheit<00:01:15.040> so<00:01:15.490> that<00:01:15.640> the<00:01:15.820> chicks

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:16.330 
75 degrees Fahrenheit so that the chicks

00:01:16.330 --> 00:01:19.109 
75 degrees Fahrenheit so that the chicks
can<00:01:16.630> move<00:01:17.020> about<00:01:17.140> to<00:01:17.939> fluctuate<00:01:18.939> and

00:01:19.109 --> 00:01:19.119 
can move about to fluctuate and

00:01:19.119 --> 00:01:21.450 
can move about to fluctuate and
temperature<00:01:19.540> as<00:01:19.689> needed<00:01:20.080> it<00:01:20.740> also<00:01:20.860> provides<00:01:21.340> a

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:21.460 
temperature as needed it also provides a

00:01:21.460 --> 00:01:24.270 
temperature as needed it also provides a
steady<00:01:21.759> supply<00:01:22.090> of<00:01:22.330> clean<00:01:22.810> water<00:01:23.250> which<00:01:24.250> is

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:24.280 
steady supply of clean water which is

00:01:24.280 --> 00:01:28.499 
steady supply of clean water which is
why<00:01:24.549> I<00:01:24.580> bought<00:01:24.939> two<00:01:26.430> Wooders<00:01:27.430> so<00:01:28.210> that<00:01:28.360> I<00:01:28.390> could

00:01:28.499 --> 00:01:28.509 
why I bought two Wooders so that I could

00:01:28.509 --> 00:01:31.469 
why I bought two Wooders so that I could
swap<00:01:28.990> one<00:01:29.229> in<00:01:29.530> and<00:01:29.820> swap<00:01:30.820> the<00:01:31.000> other<00:01:31.119> one<00:01:31.299> out

00:01:31.469 --> 00:01:31.479 
swap one in and swap the other one out

00:01:31.479 --> 00:01:36.120 
swap one in and swap the other one out
for<00:01:31.720> cleaning<00:01:32.820> once<00:01:33.820> or<00:01:34.090> twice<00:01:34.210> a<00:01:34.329> day<00:01:34.950> it<00:01:35.950> also

00:01:36.120 --> 00:01:36.130 
for cleaning once or twice a day it also

00:01:36.130 --> 00:01:39.929 
for cleaning once or twice a day it also
provides<00:01:36.360> steady<00:01:37.360> food<00:01:37.659> supply<00:01:38.880> now<00:01:39.880> the

00:01:39.929 --> 00:01:39.939 
provides steady food supply now the

00:01:39.939 --> 00:01:41.880 
provides steady food supply now the
first<00:01:40.180> couple<00:01:40.570> days<00:01:40.600> I<00:01:40.930> put<00:01:41.110> the<00:01:41.200> food<00:01:41.409> next<00:01:41.710> to

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:41.890 
first couple days I put the food next to

00:01:41.890 --> 00:01:45.270 
first couple days I put the food next to
the<00:01:42.009> feeder<00:01:42.250> and<00:01:43.320> after<00:01:44.320> that<00:01:44.350> they<00:01:44.740> should<00:01:45.040> be

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:45.280 
the feeder and after that they should be

00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:47.999 
the feeder and after that they should be
finding<00:01:45.640> the<00:01:45.880> food<00:01:46.119> on<00:01:46.360> their<00:01:46.810> own<00:01:46.930> now<00:01:47.740> use<00:01:47.979> a

00:01:47.999 --> 00:01:48.009 
finding the food on their own now use a

00:01:48.009 --> 00:01:49.889 
finding the food on their own now use a
special<00:01:48.520> feeder<00:01:48.759> that<00:01:49.180> only<00:01:49.360> allows<00:01:49.570> our

00:01:49.889 --> 00:01:49.899 
special feeder that only allows our

00:01:49.899 --> 00:01:51.539 
special feeder that only allows our
heads<00:01:50.110> to<00:01:50.290> go<00:01:50.409> in<00:01:50.560> that<00:01:50.799> way<00:01:51.009> they<00:01:51.159> don't<00:01:51.189> kick

00:01:51.539 --> 00:01:51.549 
heads to go in that way they don't kick

00:01:51.549 --> 00:01:53.219 
heads to go in that way they don't kick
the<00:01:51.729> feet<00:01:51.909> all<00:01:52.090> over<00:01:52.119> the<00:01:52.479> place<00:01:52.689> it<00:01:53.079> also

00:01:53.219 --> 00:01:53.229 
the feet all over the place it also

00:01:53.229 --> 00:01:55.710 
the feet all over the place it also
prevents<00:01:53.649> them<00:01:54.030> because<00:01:55.030> it's<00:01:55.240> angled

00:01:55.710 --> 00:01:55.720 
prevents them because it's angled

00:01:55.720 --> 00:01:57.630 
prevents them because it's angled
they're<00:01:56.710> not<00:01:56.799> going<00:01:56.950> to<00:01:57.040> spend<00:01:57.250> a<00:01:57.340> lot<00:01:57.490> of<00:01:57.520> time

00:01:57.630 --> 00:01:57.640 
they're not going to spend a lot of time

00:01:57.640 --> 00:01:59.340 
they're not going to spend a lot of time
up<00:01:57.850> here<00:01:58.000> so<00:01:58.540> that's<00:01:58.720> going<00:01:58.840> to<00:01:58.930> prevent<00:01:59.170> them

00:01:59.340 --> 00:01:59.350 
up here so that's going to prevent them

00:01:59.350 --> 00:02:03.149 
up here so that's going to prevent them
from<00:01:59.380> pooping<00:01:59.950> in<00:02:00.759> their<00:02:01.509> food<00:02:02.159> cleanliness
