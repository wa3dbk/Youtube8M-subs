00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:13.140 
way okay so guys like Chris Paul I've

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:14.450 
way okay so guys like Chris Paul I've
done<00:01:13.320> this<00:01:13.439> I've<00:01:13.619> seen<00:01:13.740> Jay<00:01:13.890> it's<00:01:14.010> hard<00:01:14.220> to<00:01:14.310> do

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:14.460 
done this I've seen Jay it's hard to do

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:15.770 
done this I've seen Jay it's hard to do
this<00:01:14.610> I've<00:01:14.760> seen<00:01:14.909> a<00:01:14.970> ton<00:01:15.150> of<00:01:15.210> players<00:01:15.509> do<00:01:15.750> this

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:15.780 
this I've seen a ton of players do this

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:18.859 
this I've seen a ton of players do this
and<00:01:16.170> basically<00:01:17.240> the<00:01:18.240> reason<00:01:18.509> that<00:01:18.570> it<00:01:18.689> works

00:01:18.859 --> 00:01:18.869 
and basically the reason that it works

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:20.300 
and basically the reason that it works
is<00:01:19.229> because<00:01:19.350> the<00:01:19.500> ball<00:01:19.770> is<00:01:19.799> not<00:01:20.009> on<00:01:20.100> the<00:01:20.159> right

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:20.310 
is because the ball is not on the right

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:21.830 
is because the ball is not on the right
side<00:01:20.580> because<00:01:21.090> you're<00:01:21.210> protecting<00:01:21.360> it<00:01:21.750> by

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:21.840 
side because you're protecting it by
