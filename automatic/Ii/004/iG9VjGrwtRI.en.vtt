I think sometimes we define heroes by
position<00:00:55.230> or<00:00:55.410> title<00:00:55.620> and<00:00:56.609> I<00:00:56.760> think<00:00:57.030> heroes<00:00:57.300> are

00:00:57.560 --> 00:00:57.570 
position or title and I think heroes are

00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:00.200 
position or title and I think heroes are
