00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:50.660 
some surveying I'm really worried about
getting<00:01:48.720> eaten<00:01:49.189> everybody<00:01:50.189> got<00:01:50.340> time<00:01:50.520> for

00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:50.670 
getting eaten everybody got time for

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:56.649 
getting eaten everybody got time for
that

00:01:56.649 --> 00:01:56.659 

00:01:56.659 --> 00:02:00.169 

all<00:01:57.659> right<00:01:57.840> so<00:01:58.170> um<00:01:58.409> I<00:01:58.829> do<00:01:59.460> like<00:01:59.549> the<00:01:59.820> idea<00:01:59.850> of

00:02:00.169 --> 00:02:00.179 
all right so um I do like the idea of

00:02:00.179 --> 00:02:01.669 
all right so um I do like the idea of
this<00:02:00.359> I<00:02:00.420> mean<00:02:00.600> it's<00:02:00.750> like<00:02:00.810> infinite<00:02:01.229> play<00:02:01.439> I

00:02:01.669 --> 00:02:01.679 
this I mean it's like infinite play I

00:02:01.679 --> 00:02:03.139 
this I mean it's like infinite play I
don't<00:02:01.859> know<00:02:01.979> how<00:02:02.189> much<00:02:02.340> longer<00:02:02.399> we're<00:02:03.060> going

00:02:03.139 --> 00:02:03.149 
don't know how much longer we're going

00:02:03.149 --> 00:02:04.910 
don't know how much longer we're going
to<00:02:03.210> do<00:02:03.359> this<00:02:03.450> let's<00:02:03.689> play<00:02:03.869> including<00:02:04.469> how<00:02:04.619> it's

00:02:04.910 --> 00:02:04.920 
to do this let's play including how it's

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:07.550 
to do this let's play including how it's
pretty<00:02:05.159> much<00:02:05.280> just<00:02:06.170> it's<00:02:07.170> pretty<00:02:07.409> much<00:02:07.500> just

00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:07.560 
pretty much just it's pretty much just

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:09.680 
pretty much just it's pretty much just
we're<00:02:07.829> going<00:02:07.950> to<00:02:08.009> be<00:02:08.160> just<00:02:08.479> replaying<00:02:09.479> this

00:02:09.680 --> 00:02:09.690 
we're going to be just replaying this

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:11.420 
we're going to be just replaying this
stuff<00:02:09.959> over<00:02:10.200> and<00:02:10.530> over<00:02:10.739> and<00:02:10.800> doing<00:02:10.979> the<00:02:11.069> exact

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:11.430 
stuff over and over and doing the exact

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:12.949

00:02:12.949 --> 00:02:12.959 
same thing over and over and it'll just

00:02:12.959 --> 00:02:15.740 
same thing over and over and it'll just
be<00:02:13.019> harder<00:02:13.650> so<00:02:14.069> I<00:02:14.489> don't<00:02:15.299> know<00:02:15.360> we<00:02:15.480> might<00:02:15.629> play

00:02:15.740 --> 00:02:15.750 
be harder so I don't know we might play

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:17.150 
be harder so I don't know we might play
a<00:02:15.810> little<00:02:16.080> bit<00:02:16.170> more<00:02:16.319> of<00:02:16.379> this<00:02:16.440> let's<00:02:16.680> play<00:02:16.860> but

00:03:47.659 --> 00:03:47.669 
home base down the road so I never had

00:03:47.669 --> 00:03:49.490 
home base down the road so I never had
this<00:03:47.819> base<00:03:48.030> before<00:03:48.419> it's<00:03:48.599> two<00:03:48.810> bases<00:03:49.169> in<00:03:49.200> this

00:03:49.490 --> 00:03:49.500 
this base before it's two bases in this

00:03:49.500 --> 00:03:54.170 
this base before it's two bases in this
entire<00:03:49.829> town<00:03:50.190> so<00:03:51.049> since<00:03:52.049> I<00:03:52.200> was<00:03:52.430> at<00:03:53.430> the<00:03:53.790> big

00:03:54.170 --> 00:03:54.180 
entire town so since I was at the big

00:03:54.180 --> 00:03:56.870 
entire town so since I was at the big
town<00:03:54.450> for<00:03:54.720> my<00:03:54.810> first<00:03:55.049> base<00:03:55.319> I<00:03:55.650> think<00:03:56.579> I<00:03:56.669> should
