00:00:05.279 --> 00:00:08.039
 It is easy to remember how you died. 

00:00:09.140 --> 00:00:11.840
 It's a feeling just like what you feel when 

00:00:11.840 --> 00:00:14.800
 an icy steel blade pierces your heart. 

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:18.760
 My soul wandered for a long time 

00:00:18.760 --> 00:00:23.700
 until, through the work of destiny, my body and my soul were reunited again. 

00:00:23.700 --> 00:00:26.400
 Giving me another chance 

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:34.620
 I was in a white limbo where my only company was a voice that told me: 

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:38.820
 "You must gather them all in the same center of the world" 

00:00:40.060 --> 00:00:45.700
 I was confused. But my throat could ask a single question: 

00:00:45.700 --> 00:00:47.009
 "Why?" 

00:00:47.800 --> 00:00:52.400
 That voice responded to me in a monotonous but firm and authoritative way: 

00:00:54.140 --> 00:00:56.140
 "Because it's your destiny." 

00:00:56.140 --> 00:01:01.260
 "Otherwise darkness would engulf all the worlds that you must protect" 

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:09.680
 A simple blink and my body was teleported to the edge of a gigantic crater. 

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:16.440
 From the surface you could not see the background. 

00:01:16.440 --> 00:01:21.040
 But I felt like a dark energy trying to emerge upwards. 

00:01:21.480 --> 00:01:24.860
 That's when I was clear why I was resurrected. 

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:30.980
 He had to enclose all the energies, creatures and evils of each world there. 

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:35.700
 But how could he cover up so much malignant energy? 

00:01:36.460 --> 00:01:40.280
 Only a thousand heroes could achieve that. 

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:46.940
 That's how DL City was born. 

00:01:48.220 --> 00:01:53.460
 A place full of heroes that would not let any of these creatures come to light. 

00:01:54.100 --> 00:01:56.820
 Even so, I was cautious. 

00:01:58.600 --> 00:02:05.600
 I sealed that underworld so that never, no one ever, could unleash the hell it locked. 

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:13.580
 So, now that you know the story. Tell me... 

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:18.760
 What need do you have to bring chaos to this world? 

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:23.640
 Because I want to be ... 

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:26.020
 eternal
