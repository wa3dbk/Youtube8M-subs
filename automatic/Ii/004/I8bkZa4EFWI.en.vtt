now you have yourself a car but I think

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:57.230

you need a present to take mini and I

00:01:57.240 --> 00:01:59.090

think the only place we have to put it
is<00:01:59.390> right<00:02:00.390> here<00:02:01.079> in<00:02:01.159> the<00:02:02.159> front<00:02:02.189> on<00:02:03.180> the
