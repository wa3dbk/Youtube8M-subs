 because we have this smartphone in our hands 

00:00:13.559 --> 00:00:19.680
 here at eataly in milan because today 

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:21.599
 vodafone presents its solution 

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:25.189
 after a good led for payments in 

00:00:21.599 --> 00:00:27.750
 mobility or via smartphone either 

00:00:25.189 --> 00:00:29.759
 we can throw away the wallet e 

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:31.320
 line or maybe just leave it at 

00:00:29.759 --> 00:00:34.200
 home and just walking around with it 

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:36.329
 smartphones make the right purchases that 

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:38.610
 we will normally do with a card of 

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:39.870
 credit or cash we can today 

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:42.120
 make them through 

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:44.880
 the smartphone simply by having it 

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:47.860
 smart mercy 

00:00:44.880 --> 00:00:50.820
 then the vodafone application 

00:00:47.860 --> 00:00:50.820
 we did the pub 

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:58.879
 vodafone gol and is a container today of 

00:00:56.059 --> 00:01:01.399
 a vodafone smart pass card because the 

00:00:58.879 --> 00:01:03.280
 before it was virtualized 

00:01:01.399 --> 00:01:07.070
 within this portfolio 

00:01:03.280 --> 00:01:10.549
 virtual but in the future this portfolio 

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:12.080
 virtual will contain a series of cards of 

00:01:10.549 --> 00:01:14.299
 payment that could be those 

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:16.399
 of your bank simply because 

00:01:14.299 --> 00:01:18.229
 these are contactless or 

00:01:16.399 --> 00:01:20.630
 allow you to pay to pay 

00:01:18.229 --> 00:01:22.970
 simply approaching the post 

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:25.480
 so this is the symbol pound we 

00:01:22.970 --> 00:01:29.140
 helps to recognize a single span 

00:01:25.480 --> 00:01:32.620
 ok then our smartphone nfc 

00:01:29.140 --> 00:01:34.600
 we need a suitable sim if 

00:01:32.620 --> 00:01:36.940
 you are already a vodafone customer , you have one 

00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:38.800
 old generation sim could go 

00:01:36.940 --> 00:01:41.230
 with any vodafone store e 

00:01:38.800 --> 00:01:44.620
 replace your standard estimate with 

00:01:41.230 --> 00:01:46.480
 a sim qua grant yourself and take advantage of the 

00:01:44.620 --> 00:01:51.900
 enel.si technology to pay in 

00:01:46.480 --> 00:01:54.880
 smart pass proximity told me that 

00:01:51.900 --> 00:01:57.250
 works in stores but if the first 

00:01:54.880 --> 00:01:59.920
 prepaid vodafone that allows you to 

00:01:57.250 --> 00:02:02.140
 make contactless payments then one 

00:01:59.920 --> 00:02:04.540
 a physical payment card 

00:02:02.140 --> 00:02:06.070
 contactless and then above all to be 

00:02:04.540 --> 00:02:08.080
 displayed inside the 

00:02:06.070 --> 00:02:10.240
 smartphone and then be used 

00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:11.920
 even a little girl in enel.si mode 

00:02:10.240 --> 00:02:14.790
 to pay through ours 

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:19.420
 cell phone but without fear simulacro store 

00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:20.890
 60 if you can then recharge it as 

00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:22.990
 you want you can recharge it from yours 

00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:25.270
 account online or maybe even 

00:02:22.990 --> 00:02:27.130
 passing telephone credit more than 

00:02:25.270 --> 00:02:28.720
 on the sim card directly in action 

00:02:27.130 --> 00:02:32.290
 I know this prepaid card because I have 

00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:35.020
 just followed the press conference by 

00:02:32.290 --> 00:02:37.630
 our stores open all day e 

00:02:35.020 --> 00:02:39.310
 then with schedules also only comfy 

00:02:37.630 --> 00:02:40.600
 very well then we put the case you 

00:02:39.310 --> 00:02:43.560
 today on this beautiful day 

00:02:40.600 --> 00:02:45.599
 maybe you came here but italy 

00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:47.910
 and you have bought all the delicious things 

00:02:45.599 --> 00:02:49.170
 that we find on the shelves very good 

00:02:47.910 --> 00:02:50.610
 I would stay here all day 

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:52.620
 then we arrive at the time to pay 

00:02:50.610 --> 00:02:55.800
 instead of pulling out your wallet 

00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:57.630
 what we have our smartphone 

00:02:55.800 --> 00:02:59.489
 we open our vodafone application 

00:02:57.630 --> 00:03:01.290
 goller we choose the card with which 

00:02:59.489 --> 00:03:05.150
 we want to pay 

00:03:01.290 --> 00:03:05.150
 we open the card of choice 

00:03:06.440 --> 00:03:12.190
 after which we kindly ask the 

00:03:08.600 --> 00:03:12.190
 construction site to set the 

00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:17.460
 and we make the payment by pressing 

00:03:14.250 --> 00:03:18.300
 simply on the pay button in a 

00:03:17.460 --> 00:03:21.110
 second 

00:03:18.300 --> 00:03:23.180
 the temptation has occurred 

00:03:21.110 --> 00:03:25.340
 the receipt will be the confirmation 

00:03:23.180 --> 00:03:25.670
 of the very active event I think of 25 

00:03:25.340 --> 00:03:27.810
 EUR 

00:03:25.670 --> 00:03:29.520
 It does not serve the pin 

00:03:27.810 --> 00:03:32.240
 and we can just go home 

00:03:29.520 --> 00:03:35.180
 after 

00:03:32.240 --> 00:03:37.160
 so it's a convenient practical method because 

00:03:35.180 --> 00:03:38.420
 definitely the mobile phone we 

00:03:37.160 --> 00:03:39.980
 more and more new may be that there 

00:03:38.420 --> 00:03:41.240
 let's forget your wallet you are 

00:03:39.980 --> 00:03:42.350
 sure that the phone you want but is 

00:03:41.240 --> 00:03:45.050
 also safe 

00:03:42.350 --> 00:03:47.650
 absolutely yes because as we know it is 

00:03:45.050 --> 00:03:51.430
 easier to remember having lost 

00:03:47.650 --> 00:03:52.849
 a smartphone madonna sings well then 

00:03:51.430 --> 00:03:55.620
 then 

00:03:52.849 --> 00:03:57.750
 vodafone first operator in Italy a 

00:03:55.620 --> 00:04:00.030
 introduce contactless payments with 

00:03:57.750 --> 00:04:02.489

00:04:00.030 --> 00:04:04.890

 for all vodafone customers three have 

00:04:06.870 --> 00:04:12.569
 in short, maximum attention is not good 

00:04:10.409 --> 00:04:14.370
 you just have to shop and pay in 

00:04:12.569 --> 00:04:15.959
 very easy way to remember to 

00:04:14.370 --> 00:04:17.849
 reload the card but don't do it 

00:04:15.959 --> 00:04:20.439
 bad figure at the cash desk 

00:04:17.849 --> 00:04:21.699

00:04:20.439 --> 00:04:24.330
