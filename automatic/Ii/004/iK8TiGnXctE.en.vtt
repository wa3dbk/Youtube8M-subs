an<00:01:46.979> introductory<00:01:47.430> track<00:01:47.939> before<00:01:48.180> hitting<00:01:48.750> you

00:01:49.039 --> 00:01:49.049 
an introductory track before hitting you

00:01:49.049 --> 00:01:51.499 
an introductory track before hitting you
with<00:01:49.619> some<00:01:49.860> meat<00:01:50.040> and<00:01:50.070> potatoes<00:01:50.700> but<00:01:50.909> this<00:01:51.360> is

00:01:51.499 --> 00:01:51.509 
with some meat and potatoes but this is

00:01:51.509 --> 00:01:52.910 
with some meat and potatoes but this is
one<00:01:51.659> that<00:01:51.840> was<00:01:52.049> done<00:01:52.170> with<00:01:52.320> the<00:01:52.409> title<00:01:52.710> track<00:01:52.890> a

00:01:52.910 --> 00:01:52.920 
one that was done with the title track a

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:55.160 
one that was done with the title track a
farewell<00:01:53.310> to<00:01:53.460> Kings<00:01:53.700> which<00:01:54.000> was<00:01:54.210> close<00:01:54.840> to<00:01:54.960> six

00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:55.170 
farewell to Kings which was close to six

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:57.020 
farewell to Kings which was close to six
minutes<00:01:55.500> in<00:01:55.590> length<00:01:55.770> so<00:01:55.920> it<00:01:56.219> does<00:01:56.460> have<00:01:56.729> a<00:01:56.759> bit

00:01:57.020 --> 00:01:57.030 
minutes in length so it does have a bit

00:01:57.030 --> 00:01:59.270 
minutes in length so it does have a bit
of<00:01:57.060> length<00:01:57.360> behind<00:01:57.540> it<00:01:57.899> I<00:01:58.079> love<00:01:58.680> the<00:01:58.890> fact<00:01:59.159> that

00:01:59.270 --> 00:01:59.280 
of length behind it I love the fact that

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:01.910 
of length behind it I love the fact that
these<00:01:59.610> are<00:02:00.170> tracks<00:02:01.170> that<00:02:01.350> have<00:02:01.560> very<00:02:01.799> good

00:02:01.910 --> 00:02:01.920 
these are tracks that have very good

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:04.039 
these are tracks that have very good
pacing<00:02:02.159> Jim<00:02:02.460> these<00:02:02.610> longer<00:02:03.149> songs<00:02:03.450> I<00:02:03.689> love<00:02:03.899> the

00:02:04.039 --> 00:02:04.049 
pacing Jim these longer songs I love the

00:02:04.049 --> 00:02:05.330 
pacing Jim these longer songs I love the
fact<00:02:04.259> that<00:02:04.380> Santa<00:02:04.590> that<00:02:04.799> just<00:02:04.979> has<00:02:05.130> this

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:05.340 
fact that Santa that just has this

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:06.859 
fact that Santa that just has this
fairly<00:02:05.549> spaced<00:02:06.000> out<00:02:06.149> effect<00:02:06.540> that<00:02:06.659> really

00:02:06.859 --> 00:02:06.869 
fairly spaced out effect that really

00:02:06.869 --> 00:02:08.719 
fairly spaced out effect that really
makes<00:02:07.530> you<00:02:07.680> think<00:02:07.860> of<00:02:08.039> so<00:02:08.310> man

00:02:08.719 --> 00:02:08.729 
makes you think of so man

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:10.969 
makes you think of so man
different<00:02:09.179> items<00:02:10.110> and<00:02:10.200> articles<00:02:10.709> from<00:02:10.860> the

00:02:10.969 --> 00:02:10.979 
different items and articles from the

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:12.470 
different items and articles from the
70s<00:02:11.430> think<00:02:11.670> about<00:02:11.879> how<00:02:12.030> the<00:02:12.090> rise<00:02:12.330> of

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:12.480 
70s think about how the rise of

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:14.150 
70s think about how the rise of
technology<00:02:13.019> is<00:02:13.110> starting<00:02:13.260> to<00:02:13.530> occur<00:02:13.860> but<00:02:14.040> we

00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:14.160 
technology is starting to occur but we

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:16.430 
technology is starting to occur but we
wouldn't<00:02:14.340> see<00:02:14.580> as<00:02:14.940> much<00:02:15.540> of<00:02:15.599> that<00:02:15.750> until<00:02:16.290> we

00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:16.440 
wouldn't see as much of that until we

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:18.770 
wouldn't see as much of that until we
reach<00:02:16.650> the<00:02:16.890> 1980s<00:02:17.550> with<00:02:17.760> you<00:02:18.269> know<00:02:18.360> really<00:02:18.390> at

00:02:18.770 --> 00:02:18.780 
reach the 1980s with you know really at

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:21.440 
reach the 1980s with you know really at
this<00:02:18.959> time<00:02:19.230> with<00:02:19.470> the<00:02:19.590> advent<00:02:19.920> of<00:02:20.450> video

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:21.450 
this time with the advent of video

00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:22.910 
this time with the advent of video
gaming<00:02:21.810> and<00:02:22.230> with<00:02:22.349> the<00:02:22.500> advent<00:02:22.650> of<00:02:22.860> the

gaming and with the advent of the

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:25.100 
gaming and with the advent of the
potential<00:02:23.760> for<00:02:23.940> computing<00:02:24.629> this<00:02:24.900> is

00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:25.110 
potential for computing this is

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:27.800 
potential for computing this is
certainly<00:02:25.620> these<00:02:26.430> ideas<00:02:26.970> and<00:02:27.269> some<00:02:27.599> of<00:02:27.720> these

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:27.810 
certainly these ideas and some of these

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:29.240 
certainly these ideas and some of these
recording<00:02:28.319> technologies<00:02:28.890> that<00:02:29.099> we're

00:02:29.240 --> 00:02:29.250 
recording technologies that we're

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:30.620 
recording technologies that we're
hearing<00:02:29.459> and<00:02:29.700> some<00:02:29.849> of<00:02:29.910> these<00:02:30.000> sound<00:02:30.300> blips

00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:30.630 
hearing and some of these sound blips

00:02:30.630 --> 00:02:32.660 
hearing and some of these sound blips
that<00:02:30.720> we<00:02:30.930> hear<00:02:31.140> is<00:02:31.260> just<00:02:31.319> very<00:02:31.800> unique<00:02:31.950> I<00:02:32.310> love

way<00:02:43.799> because<00:02:44.250> these<00:02:44.580> are<00:02:44.819> tracks<00:02:45.090> that<00:02:45.269> are

00:02:45.380 --> 00:02:45.390 
way because these are tracks that are

00:02:45.390 --> 00:02:48.470 
way because these are tracks that are

this album flows superbly and that is

this album flows superbly and that is
what<00:04:47.440> helps<00:04:47.860> it<00:04:48.220> so<00:04:48.639> much<00:04:49.440> this<00:04:50.440> is<00:04:50.710> a<00:04:51.039> album

00:04:54.719 --> 00:04:54.729 
that I think really shows that whenever

00:04:54.729 --> 00:04:58.260 
that I think really shows that whenever
you<00:04:55.030> take<00:04:55.060> a<00:04:55.330> little<00:04:55.720> bit<00:04:55.840> of<00:04:55.990> care<00:04:56.320> in<00:04:57.090> the<00:04:58.090> way

00:04:58.260 --> 00:04:58.270 
you take a little bit of care in the way

00:04:58.270 --> 00:05:01.230 
you take a little bit of care in the way
in<00:04:58.419> which<00:04:58.570> you<00:04:58.840> model<00:04:59.320> your<00:04:59.500> album<00:05:00.030> you<00:05:01.030> can

00:05:01.230 --> 00:05:01.240 
in which you model your album you can

00:05:01.240 --> 00:05:03.719 
in which you model your album you can
make<00:05:01.539> a<00:05:01.570> success<00:05:02.199> out<00:05:02.440> of<00:05:02.500> anything<00:05:03.160> I<00:05:03.310> think

00:05:03.719 --> 00:05:03.729 
make a success out of anything I think

00:05:03.729 --> 00:05:06.480 
make a success out of anything I think
that<00:05:03.970> what<00:05:04.750> some<00:05:05.110> of<00:05:05.320> the<00:05:05.470> previous<00:05:06.160> rush

00:05:06.480 --> 00:05:06.490 
that what some of the previous rush

00:05:06.490 --> 00:05:09.750 
that what some of the previous rush
releases<00:05:07.500> really<00:05:08.500> kind<00:05:08.770> of<00:05:08.889> faltered<00:05:09.430> one

00:05:09.750 --> 00:05:09.760 
releases really kind of faltered one

00:05:09.760 --> 00:05:13.140 
releases really kind of faltered one
from<00:05:10.539> and<00:05:11.169> I'm<00:05:11.289> thinking<00:05:12.030> specifically<00:05:13.030> of

00:05:13.140 --> 00:05:13.150 
from and I'm thinking specifically of

00:05:13.150 --> 00:05:15.960 
from and I'm thinking specifically of
Chris<00:05:13.449> of<00:05:13.599> Steel<00:05:13.840> is<00:05:14.190> the<00:05:15.190> way<00:05:15.550> in<00:05:15.789> which

00:05:15.960 --> 00:05:15.970 
Chris of Steel is the way in which

00:05:15.970 --> 00:05:18.540 
Chris of Steel is the way in which
they're<00:05:16.180> put<00:05:16.330> together<00:05:16.479> I<00:05:16.810> think<00:05:16.960> that<00:05:17.550> this

00:05:18.540 --> 00:05:18.550 
they're put together I think that this

00:05:18.550 --> 00:05:20.580 
they're put together I think that this
one<00:05:18.820> does<00:05:19.090> all<00:05:19.479> the<00:05:19.780> correct<00:05:20.080> things<00:05:20.320> by

00:05:20.580 --> 00:05:20.590 
one does all the correct things by

00:05:20.590 --> 00:05:23.430 
one does all the correct things by
having<00:05:21.070> one<00:05:21.460> large<00:05:21.759> song<00:05:22.300> on<00:05:22.630> each<00:05:22.840> side<00:05:23.139> the<00:05:23.410> a

00:05:23.430 --> 00:05:23.440 
having one large song on each side the a

00:05:23.440 --> 00:05:26.670 
having one large song on each side the a
or<00:05:23.740> the<00:05:23.770> B<00:05:23.889> side<00:05:24.340> of<00:05:24.370> the<00:05:24.550> record<00:05:24.820> and<00:05:25.470> it<00:05:26.470> also

00:05:26.670 --> 00:05:26.680 
or the B side of the record and it also

00:05:26.680 --> 00:05:28.529 
or the B side of the record and it also
has<00:05:27.130> something<00:05:27.520> a<00:05:27.729> little<00:05:27.970> bit<00:05:28.090> short<00:05:28.389> or

00:05:28.529 --> 00:05:28.539 
has something a little bit short or

00:05:28.539 --> 00:05:30.240 
has something a little bit short or
something<00:05:28.570> a<00:05:28.870> little<00:05:29.080> bit<00:05:29.199> smaller<00:05:29.349> in<00:05:29.919> order

00:05:30.240 --> 00:05:30.250 
something a little bit smaller in order

00:05:30.250 --> 00:05:32.070 
something a little bit smaller in order
to<00:05:30.430> kind<00:05:30.610> of<00:05:30.729> bridge<00:05:31.210> the<00:05:31.240> gap<00:05:31.539> a<00:05:31.570> little<00:05:31.930> bit

00:05:32.070 --> 00:05:32.080 
to kind of bridge the gap a little bit

00:05:32.080 --> 00:05:33.659 
to kind of bridge the gap a little bit
and<00:05:32.260> I<00:05:32.289> think<00:05:32.530> that<00:05:32.710> gives<00:05:33.099> it<00:05:33.310> a<00:05:33.460> lot<00:05:33.639> of

00:05:33.659 --> 00:05:33.669 
and I think that gives it a lot of

00:05:33.669 --> 00:05:37.620 
and I think that gives it a lot of
character<00:05:34.000> while<00:05:34.479> also<00:05:35.130> very<00:05:36.130> expertly<00:05:36.789> a

00:05:37.620 --> 00:05:37.630 
character while also very expertly a

00:05:37.630 --> 00:05:40.200 
character while also very expertly a
kind<00:05:38.199> of<00:05:38.289> keeping<00:05:38.650> pace<00:05:38.919> in<00:05:39.130> mind<00:05:39.370> and<00:05:39.639> keeping

00:05:40.200 --> 00:05:40.210 
kind of keeping pace in mind and keeping

00:05:40.210 --> 00:05:43.170 
kind of keeping pace in mind and keeping
the<00:05:40.510> idea<00:05:40.810> of<00:05:41.050> interest<00:05:42.039> in<00:05:42.220> mind<00:05:42.460> for<00:05:42.909> a

00:05:43.170 --> 00:05:43.180 
the idea of interest in mind for a

00:05:43.180 --> 00:05:44.850 
the idea of interest in mind for a
listener<00:05:43.840> I<00:05:44.080> think<00:05:44.500> all<00:05:44.620> of<00:05:44.650> those<00:05:44.800> things

00:05:44.850 --> 00:05:44.860 
listener I think all of those things

00:05:44.860 --> 00:05:46.620 
listener I think all of those things
were<00:05:45.099> handled<00:05:45.370> very<00:05:45.460> nicely<00:05:45.729> on<00:05:45.970> a<00:05:46.150> farewell

were handled very nicely on a farewell
to<00:05:46.780> Kings<00:05:46.990> although<00:05:47.560> if<00:05:47.740> you<00:05:47.860> look<00:05:47.970> if<00:05:48.970> you

00:05:48.990 --> 00:05:49.000 
to Kings although if you look if you

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:51.510 
to Kings although if you look if you
look<00:05:49.270> at<00:05:49.419> side<00:05:49.720> a<00:05:49.930> and<00:05:50.199> side<00:05:50.289> B<00:05:50.620> the<00:05:51.070> old<00:05:51.159> notes

00:05:51.510 --> 00:05:51.520 
look at side a and side B the old notes

00:05:51.520 --> 00:05:53.580 
look at side a and side B the old notes
that<00:05:52.180> they<00:05:52.270> were<00:05:52.330> handled<00:05:52.690> in<00:05:52.750> two<00:05:53.080> completely

00:05:53.580 --> 00:05:53.590 
that they were handled in two completely

00:05:53.590 --> 00:05:56.610 
that they were handled in two completely
different<00:05:53.889> ways<00:05:54.310> but<00:05:54.760> both<00:05:55.060> ways<00:05:55.479> work<00:05:56.050> just

00:05:56.610 --> 00:05:56.620 
different ways but both ways work just

00:05:56.620 --> 00:05:59.370
