so I did feel really sad and I do have

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:35.270 
so I did feel really sad and I do have
such<00:00:33.540> a<00:00:33.570> big<00:00:33.930> big<00:00:34.170> heart<00:00:34.500> for<00:00:34.559> animals<00:00:34.800> and

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:35.280 
such a big big heart for animals and

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:38.569 
such a big big heart for animals and
when<00:00:36.149> I<00:00:36.180> saw<00:00:36.480> cubby<00:00:37.020> I<00:00:37.050> was<00:00:37.380> like<00:00:37.530> oh<00:00:37.680> my<00:00:37.710> god<00:00:38.100> he

00:00:38.569 --> 00:00:38.579 
when I saw cubby I was like oh my god he

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:40.970 
when I saw cubby I was like oh my god he
looks<00:00:38.610> just<00:00:38.879> like<00:00:39.180> Sparky<00:00:39.899> which<00:00:40.530> is<00:00:40.680> my<00:00:40.800> other

00:00:40.970 --> 00:00:40.980 
looks just like Sparky which is my other

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:43.100 
looks just like Sparky which is my other
dog<00:00:41.340> and<00:00:41.700> I<00:00:42.239> thought<00:00:42.420> it<00:00:42.690> would<00:00:42.750> be<00:00:42.899> such<00:00:43.079> a

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:43.110 
dog and I thought it would be such a

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:45.380 
dog and I thought it would be such a
great<00:00:43.290> idea<00:00:43.680> to<00:00:44.010> have<00:00:44.160> to<00:00:44.760> get<00:00:44.879> another<00:00:45.090> dog

00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:45.390 
great idea to have to get another dog

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:47.569 
great idea to have to get another dog
for<00:00:45.719> Sparky<00:00:46.200> so<00:00:46.710> we'd<00:00:46.860> have<00:00:46.920> like<00:00:47.370> a<00:00:47.399> little

00:00:47.569 --> 00:00:47.579 
for Sparky so we'd have like a little

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:49.549 
for Sparky so we'd have like a little
play<00:00:47.910> me<00:00:48.090> because<00:00:48.450> Sparky<00:00:48.840> is<00:00:48.989> getting<00:00:49.410> a

00:00:49.549 --> 00:00:49.559 
play me because Sparky is getting a

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:51.410 
play me because Sparky is getting a
little<00:00:49.950> bit<00:00:50.129> older<00:00:50.489> he's<00:00:50.820> four<00:00:51.090> years<00:00:51.120> old

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:51.420 
little bit older he's four years old

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:53.840 
little bit older he's four years old
he's<00:00:51.600> about<00:00:51.750> to<00:00:51.899> be<00:00:52.020> five<00:00:52.289> in<00:00:52.320> July<00:00:52.860> and<00:00:53.190> I<00:00:53.640> just

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:53.850 
he's about to be five in July and I just

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:55.040

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:57.799 
thought it'd be such a great idea to
have<00:00:55.350> a<00:00:56.280> little<00:00:56.730> brother<00:00:56.910> for<00:00:57.300> him<00:00:57.480> so<00:00:57.750> the

like a breeder because there's so many
dogs<00:01:36.150> from<00:01:36.390> the<00:01:36.450> animal<00:01:36.540> shelter<00:01:36.810> that<00:01:37.290> don't

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:37.560 
dogs from the animal shelter that don't

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:40.910

have<00:01:37.740> a<00:01:37.770> home<00:01:38.159> and<00:01:39.470> so<00:01:40.470> I<00:01:40.530> definitely<00:01:40.680> do

recommend checking at your local animal

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:44.210 
recommend checking at your local animal
shelter<00:01:42.720> because<00:01:43.200> a<00:01:43.320> lot<00:01:43.530> of<00:01:43.560> these<00:01:43.740> animals

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:44.220 
shelter because a lot of these animals

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:46.550 
shelter because a lot of these animals
don't<00:01:44.399> have<00:01:44.520> homes<00:01:44.939> and<00:01:45.299> you<00:01:46.020> know<00:01:46.170> I<00:01:46.200> mean

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:48.390 
these animals didn't choose to be born

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:50.719 
these animals didn't choose to be born
into<00:01:48.750> this<00:01:48.960> world<00:01:49.020> to<00:01:49.649> be<00:01:50.009> left<00:01:50.250> on<00:01:50.369> the<00:01:50.490> street
