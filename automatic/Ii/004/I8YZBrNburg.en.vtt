00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:05.519
 opportunity it was not easy to really get 

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:07.829
 this 

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:11.219
 but through the cooperative and the 

00:01:07.829 --> 00:01:13.170
 association we managed to enter we do not have a 

00:01:11.219 --> 00:01:15.329

00:01:21.550 --> 00:01:25.130
 and allows to work with more tranquility 

00:01:23.170 --> 00:01:27.049
