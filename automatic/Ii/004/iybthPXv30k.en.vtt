this is how to use gorebyss now I know
hunt<00:00:03.389> L<00:00:03.570> comes<00:00:03.810> first<00:00:04.170> in<00:00:04.350> pokedex<00:00:04.770> order<00:00:05.009> but

00:00:05.420 --> 00:00:05.430 
hunt L comes first in pokedex order but

00:00:05.430 --> 00:00:06.860 
hunt L comes first in pokedex order but
gorebyss<00:00:05.759> is<00:00:05.910> better<00:00:06.089> to<00:00:06.240> talk<00:00:06.420> about<00:00:06.540> first

00:00:06.860 --> 00:00:06.870 
gorebyss is better to talk about first

00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:08.690 
gorebyss is better to talk about first
because<00:00:07.200> it<00:00:07.379> is<00:00:07.410> a<00:00:07.529> better<00:00:07.919> Pokemon<00:00:08.519> min

00:00:08.690 --> 00:00:08.700 
because it is a better Pokemon min

00:00:11.509 --> 00:00:11.519 
huntail in certain aspects so instead of

00:00:11.519 --> 00:00:12.709 
huntail in certain aspects so instead of
confusing<00:00:11.910> people<00:00:12.030> I<00:00:12.179> want<00:00:12.389> to<00:00:12.450> do<00:00:12.570> those

confusing people I want to do those

00:00:12.719 --> 00:00:14.539 
confusing people I want to do those
aspects<00:00:13.170> first<00:00:13.320> then<00:00:13.830> talk<00:00:14.009> about<00:00:14.040> huntail

00:00:14.539 --> 00:00:14.549

strengths<00:00:14.969> in<00:00:15.089> the<00:00:15.179> next<00:00:15.389> video<00:00:15.630> so<00:00:16.199> we<00:00:16.289> look

00:00:16.430 --> 00:00:16.440 
strengths in the next video so we look

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:18.080 
strengths in the next video so we look
at<00:00:16.529> gorebyss<00:00:16.859> it's<00:00:17.039> going<00:00:17.340> to<00:00:17.430> be<00:00:17.609> a<00:00:17.640> really

00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:18.090 
at gorebyss it's going to be a really

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:20.870 
at gorebyss it's going to be a really
interesting<00:00:18.119> Pokemon<00:00:18.840> because<00:00:19.609> 105<00:00:20.609> on<00:00:20.789> the

00:00:20.870 --> 00:00:20.880 
interesting Pokemon because 105 on the

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:23.090 
interesting Pokemon because 105 on the
defense<00:00:21.119> 72<00:00:21.930> on<00:00:22.109> the<00:00:22.140> special<00:00:22.590> defense<00:00:22.859> but

00:00:23.090 --> 00:00:23.100 
defense 72 on the special defense but

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:24.200 
defense 72 on the special defense but
then<00:00:23.250> really<00:00:23.550> low<00:00:23.670> hitpoints

00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:24.210 
then really low hitpoints

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:26.060 
then really low hitpoints
so<00:00:24.660> it<00:00:24.720> has<00:00:24.869> some<00:00:25.140> interesting<00:00:25.529> tanky

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:26.070 
so it has some interesting tanky

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:27.890 
so it has some interesting tanky
potential<00:00:26.519> but<00:00:26.760> not<00:00:26.939> a<00:00:26.970> lot<00:00:27.359> because<00:00:27.539> of<00:00:27.750> its

00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:27.900 
potential but not a lot because of its

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:30.259 
potential but not a lot because of its
lower<00:00:28.050> hit<00:00:28.289> points<00:00:28.590> also<00:00:28.949> its<00:00:29.250> 114<00:00:29.939> special

00:00:30.259 --> 00:00:30.269 
lower hit points also its 114 special

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:32.540 
lower hit points also its 114 special
attack<00:00:30.480> which<00:00:30.689> is<00:00:30.810> really<00:00:31.019> strong<00:00:31.320> but<00:00:31.859> 52<00:00:32.399> on

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:32.550 
attack which is really strong but 52 on

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:34.819 
attack which is really strong but 52 on
that<00:00:32.669> speed<00:00:32.910> is<00:00:33.059> going<00:00:33.270> to<00:00:33.450> be<00:00:33.630> a<00:00:33.660> not<00:00:34.380> outright

00:00:34.819 --> 00:00:34.829 
that speed is going to be a not outright

00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:36.709 
that speed is going to be a not outright
sweeper<00:00:35.280> II<00:00:35.370> so<00:00:35.700> that's<00:00:35.969> just<00:00:36.180> kind<00:00:36.329> of<00:00:36.390> one<00:00:36.660> of

00:00:36.709 --> 00:00:36.719 
sweeper II so that's just kind of one of

00:00:36.719 --> 00:00:37.850 
sweeper II so that's just kind of one of
the<00:00:36.870> things<00:00:37.050> that<00:00:37.170> we're<00:00:37.290> observing

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:37.860 
the things that we're observing

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:39.440 
the things that we're observing
initially<00:00:38.340> then<00:00:38.790> when<00:00:38.879> we<00:00:38.940> go<00:00:39.059> into<00:00:39.300> its

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:39.450 
initially then when we go into its

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:41.030 
initially then when we go into its
typing<00:00:39.809> pure<00:00:40.020> water<00:00:40.200> type<00:00:40.440> which<00:00:40.649> is<00:00:40.770> actually

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:41.040 
typing pure water type which is actually

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:42.950 
typing pure water type which is actually
really<00:00:41.160> nice<00:00:41.340> only<00:00:42.090> we<00:00:42.210> can<00:00:42.390> scratch<00:00:42.690> like

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:42.960 
really nice only we can scratch like

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:45.680 
really nice only we can scratch like
grass<00:00:43.379> electric<00:00:43.829> for<00:00:44.340> resistances<00:00:44.940> and<00:00:45.239> it's

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:45.690 
grass electric for resistances and it's

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:47.720 
grass electric for resistances and it's
a<00:00:45.750> decent<00:00:46.050> amount<00:00:46.140> stab<00:00:46.950> move<00:00:47.190> that<00:00:47.430> you<00:00:47.610> know

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:47.730 
a decent amount stab move that you know

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:49.160 
a decent amount stab move that you know
water<00:00:47.940> hits<00:00:48.180> a<00:00:48.450> lot<00:00:48.600> of<00:00:48.660> things<00:00:48.899> pretty<00:00:49.110> well

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:49.170 
water hits a lot of things pretty well

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:51.680 
water hits a lot of things pretty well
and<00:00:49.680> it's<00:00:49.920> just<00:00:50.039> really<00:00:50.309> solid<00:00:51.059> typing<00:00:51.420> but

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:51.690 
and it's just really solid typing but

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:53.240 
and it's just really solid typing but
overall<00:00:52.320> we're<00:00:52.559> gonna<00:00:52.739> have<00:00:52.890> to<00:00:52.949> see<00:00:53.039> gorgeous

you have the option to bond the top pass

00:04:53.919 --> 00:04:56.159 
you have the option to bond the top pass
and<00:04:54.160> now<00:04:54.490> you're<00:04:54.639> making<00:04:54.970> any<00:04:55.240> Pokemon<00:04:55.840> into<00:04:56.139> a

00:04:56.159 --> 00:04:56.169 
and now you're making any Pokemon into a

00:04:56.169 --> 00:04:58.110 
and now you're making any Pokemon into a
super<00:04:56.590> tank<00:04:56.800> I've<00:04:57.039> never<00:04:57.520> seen<00:04:57.759> a<00:04:57.789> set<00:04:57.970> like

00:04:58.110 --> 00:04:58.120 
super tank I've never seen a set like

00:04:58.120 --> 00:04:59.399 
super tank I've never seen a set like
this<00:04:58.300> on<00:04:58.449> gorebyss<00:04:58.750> but<00:04:58.930> I<00:04:58.960> think<00:04:59.139> it<00:04:59.259> can<00:04:59.380> be

00:04:59.399 --> 00:04:59.409 
this on gorebyss but I think it can be

00:04:59.409 --> 00:05:01.230 
this on gorebyss but I think it can be
very<00:04:59.500> solid<00:05:00.009> now<00:05:00.610> also<00:05:00.880> if<00:05:01.000> you're<00:05:01.120> really

00:05:01.230 --> 00:05:01.240 
very solid now also if you're really

00:05:01.240 --> 00:05:02.820 
very solid now also if you're really
playing<00:05:01.509> in<00:05:01.659> that<00:05:01.750> Swiss<00:05:02.020> swim<00:05:02.229> you<00:05:02.680> can

00:05:02.820 --> 00:05:02.830 
playing in that Swiss swim you can

00:05:02.830 --> 00:05:04.890 
playing in that Swiss swim you can
invest<00:05:03.130> into<00:05:03.400> other<00:05:03.819> areas<00:05:04.240> like<00:05:04.270> you<00:05:04.539> can<00:05:04.690> put

00:05:04.890 --> 00:05:04.900 
invest into other areas like you can put

00:05:04.900 --> 00:05:06.510 
invest into other areas like you can put
more<00:05:05.440> into<00:05:05.560> your<00:05:05.740> special<00:05:05.949> offense<00:05:06.310> you're
