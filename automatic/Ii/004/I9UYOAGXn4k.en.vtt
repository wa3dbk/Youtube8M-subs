thing trees darks water

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:13.550 
thing trees darks water
which<00:01:12.210> again

00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:13.560 
which again

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:16.910

shuttle one more time single player
crippled<00:01:17.579> it<00:01:18.000> tends<00:01:18.329> to<00:01:18.420> change<00:01:18.720> everything

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:19.140 
crippled it tends to change everything

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:22.580 
crippled it tends to change everything
out<00:01:19.350> there<00:01:19.700> in<00:01:20.700> just<00:01:20.880> a<00:01:21.030> homepage<00:01:21.560> you<00:01:22.560> can

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:22.590 
out there in just a homepage you can

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:25.999 
out there in just a homepage you can
never<00:01:22.829> really<00:01:22.979> find<00:01:23.369> out<00:01:24.740> what<00:01:25.740> it's<00:01:25.860> going<00:01:25.950> to

00:01:25.999 --> 00:01:26.009 
never really find out what it's going to

00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:29.600 
never really find out what it's going to
be<00:01:26.070> unless<00:01:26.369> you<00:01:26.520> load<00:01:26.670> it<00:01:26.700> so<00:01:28.460> let's<00:01:29.460> have<00:01:29.549> a

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:29.610 
be unless you load it so let's have a

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:31.279 
be unless you load it so let's have a
look<00:01:29.700> if<00:01:30.000> it<00:01:30.119> changes<00:01:30.479> to<00:01:30.539> the<00:01:30.720> mountain<00:01:31.020> model

00:01:31.279 --> 00:01:31.289 
look if it changes to the mountain model

00:01:31.289 --> 00:01:36.160 
look if it changes to the mountain model
I<00:01:31.970> think<00:01:32.970> it<00:01:33.060> adds<00:01:33.679> this<00:01:34.679> is<00:01:34.890> mountain<00:01:35.549> one

00:01:36.160 --> 00:01:36.170 
I think it adds this is mountain one

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:39.859 
I think it adds this is mountain one
