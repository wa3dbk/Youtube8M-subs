00:00:02.159 --> 00:00:07.209
 hello good morning I'm alancito of stem and 

00:00:05.859 --> 00:00:09.160
 in this video I'm going to do some 

00:00:07.209 --> 00:00:11.740
 general response comments with 

00:00:09.160 --> 00:00:13.030
 about what happens between windows 10 and 

00:00:11.740 --> 00:00:16.000
 the users who use the system 

00:00:13.030 --> 00:00:18.070
 pirated clear ah to start that from 

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:19.570
 my part I do not support at all the 

00:00:18.070 --> 00:00:21.550
 practice of hacking software that 

00:00:19.570 --> 00:00:22.869
 it is illegal after all but 

00:00:21.550 --> 00:00:24.699
 seeing the amount of people that in the 

00:00:22.869 --> 00:00:26.830
 world has non-legitimate versions of 

00:00:24.699 --> 00:00:28.689
 windows I thought necessary to make some 

00:00:26.830 --> 00:00:30.789
 clarifications about it that are not 

00:00:28.689 --> 00:00:33.040
 present neither on the internet nor made by 

00:00:30.789 --> 00:00:35.530
 the microsoft itself 

00:00:33.040 --> 00:00:37.120
 let's start from the base that windows 

00:00:35.530 --> 00:00:39.850
 10 is free for users of 

00:00:37.120 --> 00:00:41.380
 windows 7 or windows 8 that should have 

00:00:39.850 --> 00:00:44.710
 seen a little button on his bar 

00:00:41.380 --> 00:00:46.480
 tasks that says get windows 10 in 

00:00:44.710 --> 00:00:48.550
 this update you pass from 

00:00:46.480 --> 00:00:50.770
 have an old system to a new one without 

00:00:48.550 --> 00:00:53.440
 lose your files or programs 

00:00:50.770 --> 00:00:55.270
 completely free form but one 

00:00:53.440 --> 00:00:58.329
 question that a lot of people did and 

00:00:55.270 --> 00:01:00.909
 it was hard to check is 

00:00:58.329 --> 00:01:04.049
 can i update to windows 10 if i have 

00:01:00.909 --> 00:01:08.130
 windows 7 or 8 not original is to say 

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:10.570
 pirated short answer if you can 

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:12.340
 response to the area when it was announced 

00:01:10.570 --> 00:01:13.930
 free upgrade people believed 

00:01:12.340 --> 00:01:15.580
 that microsoft was going to allow the 

00:01:13.930 --> 00:01:18.549
 pirate users make their windows 

00:01:15.580 --> 00:01:21.130
 happen to be original this is false 

00:01:18.549 --> 00:01:22.869
 all points of view the users 

00:01:21.130 --> 00:01:24.450
 pirates are pirates and those who paid 

00:01:22.869 --> 00:01:26.710
 for the software they paid for the software 

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:28.539
 which it is a pirate user to the end of the day 

00:01:26.710 --> 00:01:30.789
 is a user that through a 

00:01:28.539 --> 00:01:32.920
 third-party software or a modification 

00:01:30.789 --> 00:01:34.600
 the original software manages to deceive 

00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:36.100
 that program or system to do it 

00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:37.959
 create that actually the program 

00:01:36.100 --> 00:01:40.119
 system is original and was acquired 

00:01:37.959 --> 00:01:41.740
 when it was not during these weeks 

00:01:40.119 --> 00:01:43.390
 Microsoft was saying that the 

00:01:41.740 --> 00:01:45.880
 pirates will not be able to upgrade to windows 

00:01:43.390 --> 00:01:47.740
 10 pirates will not have windows 

00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:50.110
 original but that does not mean that no 

00:01:47.740 --> 00:01:51.429
 can you update microsoft you can not 

00:01:50.110 --> 00:01:53.380
 know that the user's windows is 

00:01:51.429 --> 00:01:55.420
 pirate just because he is pirate 

00:01:53.380 --> 00:01:56.680
 try to make microsoft not know that 

00:01:55.420 --> 00:01:58.750
 detail 

00:01:56.680 --> 00:02:00.820
 when updating to windows 10 if your system 

00:01:58.750 --> 00:02:02.560
 is correctly pirated should not 

00:02:00.820 --> 00:02:04.270
 appear alerts you in any kind and 

00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:06.250
 you should be able to update it directly 

00:02:04.270 --> 00:02:07.840
 without problems keeping you always in 

00:02:06.250 --> 00:02:09.560
 the margin of illegal software by 

00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:11.780
 supposed 

00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:13.819
 what happens if my copy is legal or good or 

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:15.739
 with a purchased PC there is no 

00:02:13.819 --> 00:02:18.060
 problem you should be able to update without 

00:02:15.739 --> 00:02:20.430
 no problem windows 10 

00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:22.650
 what is that of the 'insiders' versions or 

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:24.120
 of microsoft test decided to give 

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:26.040
 about a year before the 

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:28.140
 launch of the windows 10 system without 

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:29.819
 finish so that people could go 

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:32.459
 testing and giving their opinions 

00:02:29.819 --> 00:02:34.560
 this program was called technical preview 

00:02:32.459 --> 00:02:37.800
 and the users who participated in it 

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:39.720
 they were called inside us a question 

00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:41.400
 that arose at a point of time was 

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:42.870
 what will users who have this 

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:45.060
 trial version with the system has been 

00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:46.800
 launched microsoft was not clear to the 

00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:49.200
 respect but hinted that they could 

00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:51.390
 keep the original system and free 

00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:54.000
 as long as they remain users of inside 

00:02:51.390 --> 00:02:55.650
 that is, as long as they continue to have 

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:57.360
 install system tests that can 

00:02:55.650 --> 00:02:59.790
 be unstable put at risk their 

00:02:57.360 --> 00:03:01.470
 files for your pc those can have 

00:02:59.790 --> 00:03:03.209
 original windows and in this way 

00:03:01.470 --> 00:03:05.400
 serve him as a guinea pig 

00:03:03.209 --> 00:03:06.920
 Indians in their system tests before 

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:11.060
 of being released to the general public 

00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:14.060
 you decide if the risk is worth it 

00:03:11.060 --> 00:03:15.620
 as I update it is assumed that this height 

00:03:14.060 --> 00:03:17.660
 should have appeared to you in your bar 

00:03:15.620 --> 00:03:19.520
 tasks a little button that says get 

00:03:17.660 --> 00:03:21.800
 windows 10 from which you should 

00:03:19.520 --> 00:03:23.660
 be able to update your computer in case 

00:03:21.800 --> 00:03:25.220
 that has not been updated and not 

00:03:23.660 --> 00:03:27.920
 find this button in your bar 

00:03:25.220 --> 00:03:29.690
 tasks go to this link that appears in 

00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:31.010
 screen right now and follow the 

00:03:29.690 --> 00:03:32.330
 instructions on the website of 

00:03:31.010 --> 00:03:34.519
 microsoft that are pretty good 

00:03:32.330 --> 00:03:36.290
 explained any question of all 

00:03:34.519 --> 00:03:37.760
 modes feel free to do it in 

00:03:36.290 --> 00:03:40.370
 the comments 

00:03:37.760 --> 00:03:42.739
 this tool will give the guides and give 

00:03:40.370 --> 00:03:44.230
 the correct instructions to be able 

00:03:42.739 --> 00:03:46.380
 perform the update 

00:03:44.230 --> 00:03:48.750
 satisfactorily 

00:03:46.380 --> 00:03:51.090
 during the update the system will 

00:03:48.750 --> 00:03:53.780
 will restart several times until a 

00:03:51.090 --> 00:03:56.250
 point will start again on windows 10 

00:03:53.780 --> 00:03:58.770
 the update almost does not require 

00:03:56.250 --> 00:04:01.770
 technical knowledge and requires 

00:03:58.770 --> 00:04:03.330
 few clicks beyond those accepted in 

00:04:01.770 --> 00:04:05.910
 the terms and conditions or the 

00:04:03.330 --> 00:04:08.270
 next or the way in which 

00:04:05.910 --> 00:04:11.060
 want to install the system 

00:04:08.270 --> 00:04:13.130
 It is convenient to update to windows 10 is the 

00:04:11.060 --> 00:04:15.590
 answer will depend on each one in what 

00:04:13.130 --> 00:04:18.200
 particular for me if I had windows 

00:04:15.590 --> 00:04:19.720
 8.1 on my pc and I think that for 

00:04:18.200 --> 00:04:22.130
 any user who has windows 8 

00:04:19.720 --> 00:04:24.290
 8.1 on 10 is a definite step 

00:04:22.130 --> 00:04:27.380
 simplify things add speed 

00:04:24.290 --> 00:04:29.150
 stability and compatibility for 

00:04:27.380 --> 00:04:31.460
 have windows 7 the thing is complicated 

00:04:29.150 --> 00:04:33.920
 a little more windows 7 already by itself is 

00:04:31.460 --> 00:04:35.840
 stable simple and compatible is a very 

00:04:33.920 --> 00:04:38.360
 good system but it's five years ago 

00:04:35.840 --> 00:04:40.850
 years the novelties presented in 10 

00:04:38.360 --> 00:04:42.350
 as the tax build that allow multiple 

00:04:40.850 --> 00:04:44.900
 desks with different windows 

00:04:42.350 --> 00:04:46.160
 cut off as a virtual assistant in 

00:04:44.900 --> 00:04:48.800
 the desk in the countries that 

00:04:46.160 --> 00:04:50.720
 support the new microsoft that allows 

00:04:48.800 --> 00:04:52.490
 write down on the sites directly the 

00:04:50.720 --> 00:04:54.740
 new start menu that brings together the best of 

00:04:52.490 --> 00:04:56.120
 windows 7 and 8 the new application of 

00:04:54.740 --> 00:04:58.460
 xbox that allows recording of 

00:04:56.120 --> 00:05:00.590
 applications and games the new design 

00:04:58.460 --> 00:05:02.330
 renewed among other things for me it's worth 

00:05:00.590 --> 00:05:04.790
 worth even more if not to 

00:05:02.330 --> 00:05:07.190
 spend no money but again this 

00:05:04.790 --> 00:05:09.800
 It is the decision of each one 

00:05:07.190 --> 00:05:12.080
 last one once I update I do not 

00:05:09.800 --> 00:05:14.569
 the curtain button appeared on my 

00:05:12.080 --> 00:05:16.710
 desk only one magnifying glass appeared 

00:05:14.569 --> 00:05:19.650
 something that I am doing wrong 

00:05:16.710 --> 00:05:21.480
 you are not doing anything wrong cut 

00:05:19.650 --> 00:05:23.370
 it's only available in a series of 

00:05:21.480 --> 00:05:25.050
 regions and microsoft detecto 

00:05:23.370 --> 00:05:27.930
 automatically the place where you are 

00:05:25.050 --> 00:05:30.170
 and it gives you cortana or not according 

00:05:27.930 --> 00:05:30.170
 to your location 

00:05:30.240 --> 00:05:34.919
 there is a way to make him believe 

00:05:32.639 --> 00:05:38.849
 microsoft that your location is not that 

00:05:34.919 --> 00:05:41.000
 to be able to have the core so different and 

00:05:38.849 --> 00:05:44.160
 to be able to possess it in your desk 

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:46.169
 this step is very well explained in 

00:05:44.160 --> 00:05:48.990
 this YouTube video that although it's from 

00:05:46.169 --> 00:05:50.490
 a few months still have exactly the 

00:05:48.990 --> 00:05:52.639
 same procedure as if one 

00:05:50.490 --> 00:05:55.009
 will now 

00:05:52.639 --> 00:05:57.199
 in case you need any 

00:05:55.009 --> 00:06:00.639
 help, feel free to ask me the 

00:05:57.199 --> 00:06:02.810
 in the comments box or in any case 

00:06:00.639 --> 00:06:04.969
 tell me if they want them to 

00:06:02.810 --> 00:06:07.289
 video separately in Spanish showing 

00:06:04.969 --> 00:06:09.300
 how to do this 

00:06:07.289 --> 00:06:12.830
 I hope you liked the video and 

00:06:09.300 --> 00:06:12.830
 greet you alancito
