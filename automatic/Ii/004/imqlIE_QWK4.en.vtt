that that plane in a different way than
anyone<00:01:18.000> else<00:01:18.150> I<00:01:18.390> think<00:01:19.350> that<00:01:19.490> Milan<00:01:20.490> had<00:01:20.790> a

00:01:21.039 --> 00:01:21.049 
anyone else I think that Milan had a

00:01:21.049 --> 00:01:26.270 
anyone else I think that Milan had a
tactic<00:01:22.049> that<00:01:23.720> gave<00:01:24.720> them<00:01:24.900> a<00:01:24.960> draw<00:01:25.200> and<00:01:25.470> I<00:01:26.189> think

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:26.280 
tactic that gave them a draw and I think

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:29.420 
tactic that gave them a draw and I think
that<00:01:26.520> they<00:01:26.880> still<00:01:27.299> hoping<00:01:27.960> that<00:01:28.220> the<00:01:29.220> same

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:29.430 
that they still hoping that the same

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:31.789 
that they still hoping that the same
will<00:01:29.610> happen<00:01:29.759> also<00:01:30.150> at<00:01:30.450> no<00:01:30.630> camp<00:01:30.930> and<00:01:31.200> that

00:01:31.789 --> 00:01:31.799 
will happen also at no camp and that

00:01:31.799 --> 00:01:33.890 
will happen also at no camp and that
maybe<00:01:32.070> they<00:01:32.250> can<00:01:32.430> make<00:01:32.610> a<00:01:32.689> counter-attack<00:01:33.689> of

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:33.900 
maybe they can make a counter-attack of

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:37.960 
maybe they can make a counter-attack of
course<00:01:34.860> it's<00:01:35.040> difficult<00:01:36.140> because<00:01:37.140> you<00:01:37.530> know

00:01:37.960 --> 00:01:37.970

teams have money wise because people

00:01:51.479 --> 00:01:53.810

00:01:56.630 --> 00:01:56.640 
to cut the you know a lot of expenses

00:01:56.640 --> 00:01:59.870 
to cut the you know a lot of expenses
about<00:01:57.119> very<00:01:57.450> difficult<00:01:58.020> but<00:01:58.740> they<00:01:58.890> still<00:01:59.100> are

00:01:59.870 --> 00:01:59.880 
about very difficult but they still are

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:03.109 
about very difficult but they still are
there<00:02:00.149> and<00:02:00.570> I<00:02:00.780> think<00:02:01.020> that<00:02:01.520> what<00:02:02.520> wafer<00:02:02.909> tries

00:02:03.109 --> 00:02:03.119 
there and I think that what wafer tries

00:02:03.119 --> 00:02:06.499 
there and I think that what wafer tries
to<00:02:03.299> do<00:02:03.450> but<00:02:04.020> the<00:02:04.170> fair<00:02:04.380> play<00:02:04.759> rule<00:02:05.759> is<00:02:06.090> it<00:02:06.329> I

00:02:06.499 --> 00:02:06.509 
to do but the fair play rule is it I

00:02:06.509 --> 00:02:08.990 
to do but the fair play rule is it I
think<00:02:06.719> it's<00:02:06.840> the<00:02:06.899> right<00:02:07.590> one<00:02:07.860> is<00:02:08.069> to<00:02:08.670> help<00:02:08.849> the

00:02:08.990 --> 00:02:09.000 
think it's the right one is to help the

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:11.660 
think it's the right one is to help the
club's<00:02:09.270> so<00:02:10.050> for<00:02:10.200> that<00:02:10.289> reason<00:02:10.430> milind<00:02:11.430> tries

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:11.670

to<00:02:11.879> do<00:02:12.000> something

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:12.510 
to do something

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:16.429 
to do something
about<00:02:12.629> it<00:02:13.220> and<00:02:14.220> and<00:02:14.939> despite<00:02:15.780> that<00:02:15.989> they<00:02:16.260> are

00:02:16.429 --> 00:02:16.439 
about it and and despite that they are

00:02:16.439 --> 00:02:18.789 
about it and and despite that they are

00:03:32.439 --> 00:03:32.449 
the world at that moment i think

00:03:32.449 --> 00:03:36.199 
the world at that moment i think
nowadays<00:03:33.449> of<00:03:34.139> course<00:03:34.470> a<00:03:34.859> lot<00:03:34.889> of<00:03:35.040> finals<00:03:35.639> have

00:03:36.199 --> 00:03:36.209 
nowadays of course a lot of finals have

00:03:36.209 --> 00:03:40.099 
nowadays of course a lot of finals have
been<00:03:36.449> played<00:03:36.720> I<00:03:37.220> think<00:03:38.220> that<00:03:39.049> now<00:03:40.049> the

00:03:40.099 --> 00:03:40.109 
been played I think that now the

00:03:40.109 --> 00:03:43.520 
been played I think that now the
difference<00:03:41.069> in<00:03:41.579> clubs<00:03:41.940> is<00:03:42.599> not<00:03:42.870> as<00:03:43.019> big<00:03:43.260> as

00:03:43.520 --> 00:03:43.530 
difference in clubs is not as big as

00:03:43.530 --> 00:03:47.119 
difference in clubs is not as big as
that<00:03:43.680> was<00:03:43.889> in<00:03:44.069> that<00:03:44.220> particular<00:03:44.730> final<00:03:46.129> so

00:03:47.119 --> 00:03:47.129 
that was in that particular final so

00:03:47.129 --> 00:03:50.300 
that was in that particular final so
therefore<00:03:47.780> you<00:03:48.780> know<00:03:48.930> the<00:03:49.139> games<00:03:49.889> that<00:03:50.040> have

00:03:50.300 --> 00:03:50.310 
therefore you know the games that have

00:03:50.310 --> 00:03:52.460 
therefore you know the games that have
been<00:03:50.519> played<00:03:50.790> have<00:03:51.449> been<00:03:51.599> all<00:03:51.750> very<00:03:52.169> very

00:03:52.460 --> 00:03:52.470

been played have been all very very
tight<00:03:53.510> we<00:03:54.510> always<00:03:54.720> hope<00:03:55.199> that<00:03:56.239> that<00:03:57.239> someone

you know a big star always flourish in
that<00:04:02.270> tournament<00:04:02.480> I<00:04:02.810> think<00:04:03.410> for<00:04:03.860> the

00:04:03.970 --> 00:04:03.980 
that tournament I think for the

00:04:03.980 --> 00:04:06.400 
that tournament I think for the
spectators<00:04:04.250> point<00:04:05.120> of<00:04:05.210> view<00:04:05.390> and<00:04:05.660> not<00:04:06.110> from<00:04:06.260> my

00:04:06.400 --> 00:04:06.410 
spectators point of view and not from my

00:04:06.410 --> 00:04:09.670 
spectators point of view and not from my
point<00:04:06.620> of<00:04:06.770> view<00:04:06.830> I<00:04:07.160> think<00:04:07.870> the<00:04:08.870> game<00:04:09.410> also

00:04:09.670 --> 00:04:09.680 
point of view I think the game also

00:04:09.680 --> 00:04:12.820 
point of view I think the game also
midland<00:04:10.490> against<00:04:10.760> liverpool<00:04:11.270> was<00:04:11.510> was<00:04:12.470> it<00:04:12.650> a

00:04:12.820 --> 00:04:12.830 
midland against liverpool was was it a

00:04:12.830 --> 00:04:15.250 
midland against liverpool was was it a
strange<00:04:13.340> game<00:04:13.580> you<00:04:14.360> know<00:04:14.510> if<00:04:14.630> you<00:04:14.750> winning<00:04:15.080> so

00:04:15.250 --> 00:04:15.260 
strange game you know if you winning so

00:04:15.260 --> 00:04:16.990 
strange game you know if you winning so
much<00:04:15.470> and<00:04:15.680> then<00:04:15.800> you<00:04:15.920> still<00:04:16.160> lose<00:04:16.370> the<00:04:16.549> game<00:04:16.700> I

00:04:16.990 --> 00:04:17.000 
much and then you still lose the game I

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:20.949 
much and then you still lose the game I
think<00:04:17.840> from<00:04:18.160> the<00:04:19.160> wafer<00:04:20.120> point<00:04:20.420> of<00:04:20.600> view<00:04:20.750> and

00:04:20.949 --> 00:04:20.959 
think from the wafer point of view and

00:04:20.959 --> 00:04:22.720 
think from the wafer point of view and
from<00:04:21.230> the<00:04:21.380> spectators<00:04:21.920> played<00:04:22.100> a<00:04:22.130> few<00:04:22.370> I<00:04:22.430> think

00:04:22.720 --> 00:04:22.730 
from the spectators played a few I think

00:04:22.730 --> 00:04:26.770 
from the spectators played a few I think
it<00:04:22.850> was<00:04:23.000> an<00:04:23.210> unbelievable<00:04:23.630> final<00:04:24.620> and<00:04:25.780> and

00:04:26.770 --> 00:04:26.780 
it was an unbelievable final and and

00:04:26.780 --> 00:04:28.780 
it was an unbelievable final and and
that's<00:04:26.930> what<00:04:27.140> that's<00:04:27.770> what<00:04:27.830> what<00:04:28.460> they<00:04:28.610> need

00:04:28.780 --> 00:04:28.790 
that's what that's what what they need

00:04:28.790 --> 00:04:30.940 
that's what that's what what they need
you<00:04:29.330> need<00:04:29.510> to<00:04:29.690> have<00:04:29.810> a<00:04:29.870> fireable<00:04:30.350> two<00:04:30.650> teams

00:04:30.940 --> 00:04:30.950 
you need to have a fireable two teams

00:04:30.950 --> 00:04:32.890 
you need to have a fireable two teams
want<00:04:31.640> to<00:04:31.670> do<00:04:31.790> everything<00:04:32.210> to<00:04:32.420> beat<00:04:32.600> each<00:04:32.630> other

00:04:34.780 --> 00:04:34.790 
and I think that we saw that in that
