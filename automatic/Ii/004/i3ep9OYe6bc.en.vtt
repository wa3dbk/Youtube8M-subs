also predicting if you're going to stay

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:55.729 
also predicting if you're going to stay
within<00:00:53.129> your<00:00:53.280> data<00:00:53.550> cap<00:00:53.879> and<00:00:54.180> if<00:00:54.930> you<00:00:55.050> go<00:00:55.320> out

00:00:55.729 --> 00:00:55.739 
within your data cap and if you go out

00:00:55.739 --> 00:00:57.740 
within your data cap and if you go out
of<00:00:56.129> a<00:00:56.190> safe<00:00:56.399> zone<00:00:56.430> it<00:00:56.879> will<00:00:56.940> change<00:00:57.180> colors<00:00:57.600> so

00:00:57.740 --> 00:00:57.750 
of a safe zone it will change colors so

00:00:57.750 --> 00:00:59.150 
of a safe zone it will change colors so
at<00:00:57.809> the<00:00:57.870> moment<00:00:58.020> I've<00:00:58.350> only<00:00:58.500> was<00:00:58.710> thirty-five

00:00:59.150 --> 00:00:59.160 
at the moment I've only was thirty-five

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:02.180 
at the moment I've only was thirty-five
percent<00:00:59.309> of<00:00:59.760> my<00:01:00.000> usage<00:01:00.600> so<00:01:01.140> it's<00:01:01.530> forecasting

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:02.190 
percent of my usage so it's forecasting

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:05.660 
percent of my usage so it's forecasting
that<00:01:02.399> it's<00:01:03.409> still<00:01:04.409> in<00:01:04.559> the<00:01:04.619> safe<00:01:04.830> zone<00:01:04.860> in<00:01:05.549> the

that it's still in the safe zone in the

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:07.010 
that it's still in the safe zone in the
bottom<00:01:06.060> it<00:01:06.210> will<00:01:06.240> show<00:01:06.420> you<00:01:06.479> how<00:01:06.600> much<00:01:06.840> you've

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:19.020 
show you again you can set individually

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:20.149 
show you again you can set individually
when<00:01:19.200> you<00:01:19.320> want<00:01:19.470> them<00:01:19.560> to<00:01:19.619> go<00:01:19.799> after<00:01:19.890> your

00:01:20.149 --> 00:01:20.159 
when you want them to go after your

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:22.249 
when you want them to go after your
first<00:01:20.310> one<00:01:20.670> at<00:01:21.060> the<00:01:21.150> moment<00:01:21.270> mindset<00:01:21.900> and

00:01:22.249 --> 00:01:22.259 
first one at the moment mindset and

00:01:22.259 --> 00:01:23.840 
first one at the moment mindset and
these<00:01:22.680> are<00:01:22.770> the<00:01:22.920> default<00:01:23.220> ones<00:01:23.580> which<00:01:23.729> I've

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:23.850 
these are the default ones which I've

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:26.899 
these are the default ones which I've
decided<00:01:24.150> to<00:01:24.390> keep<00:01:24.570> so<00:01:25.229> when<00:01:25.920> I<00:01:26.009> go<00:01:26.189> over<00:01:26.549> the

00:01:26.899 --> 00:01:26.909 
decided to keep so when I go over the

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:28.670 
decided to keep so when I go over the
percent<00:01:27.270> that's<00:01:27.479> my<00:01:27.659> first<00:01:27.869> alert<00:01:28.229> seventy

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:28.680 
percent that's my first alert seventy

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:29.899 
percent that's my first alert seventy
percent<00:01:28.740> names<00:01:29.189> in<00:01:29.400> and<00:01:29.520> one<00:01:29.610> hundred<00:01:29.880> percent

00:01:29.899 --> 00:01:29.909 
percent names in and one hundred percent

00:01:29.909 --> 00:01:31.880 
percent names in and one hundred percent
so<00:01:30.600> it's<00:01:30.689> always<00:01:30.840> gonna<00:01:31.020> let<00:01:31.170> you<00:01:31.259> know<00:01:31.409> when

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:31.890 
so it's always gonna let you know when

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:33.920 
so it's always gonna let you know when
you<00:01:32.009> go<00:01:32.130> over<00:01:32.430> there<00:01:32.670> you<00:01:33.180> can<00:01:33.299> also<00:01:33.450> view<00:01:33.869> your

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:33.930 
you go over there you can also view your

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:37.010 
you go over there you can also view your
past<00:01:34.500> usage<00:01:35.009> and<00:01:35.250> as<00:01:36.000> I<00:01:36.299> showed<00:01:36.450> before<00:01:36.479> it's

00:01:37.010 --> 00:01:37.020 
past usage and as I showed before it's
