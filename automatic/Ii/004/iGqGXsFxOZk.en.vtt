00:01:09.109 --> 00:01:09.119 
starts coming into play Cotton's these

are breathable fabrics that usually a

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:14.300 
are breathable fabrics that usually a
weave<00:01:11.700> isn't<00:01:12.119> as<00:01:12.299> tight<00:01:12.689> so<00:01:13.110> a<00:01:13.140> more<00:01:13.920> open

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:14.310 
weave isn't as tight so a more open

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:16.850 
weave isn't as tight so a more open
weave<00:01:14.520> you<00:01:15.030> know<00:01:15.119> obviously<00:01:15.540> let's<00:01:15.750> air<00:01:16.049> come

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:16.860 
weave you know obviously let's air come

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:18.859 
weave you know obviously let's air come
in<00:01:16.979> and<00:01:17.100> out<00:01:17.220> and<00:01:17.460> it<00:01:17.549> expels<00:01:18.180> heat<00:01:18.509> from<00:01:18.720> the

00:01:18.859 --> 00:01:18.869 
in and out and it expels heat from the

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:20.690 
in and out and it expels heat from the
body<00:01:19.080> so<00:01:19.350> that<00:01:19.500> way<00:01:19.740> you're<00:01:19.890> not<00:01:19.920> insulating

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:20.700 
body so that way you're not insulating

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:22.100 
body so that way you're not insulating
the<00:01:20.790> heat<00:01:20.939> so<00:01:21.180> when<00:01:21.540> you're<00:01:21.689> looking<00:01:21.990> around

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:22.110 
the heat so when you're looking around

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:24.320 
the heat so when you're looking around
shop<00:01:22.770> linen<00:01:23.189> is<00:01:23.280> shirts<00:01:23.520> linen<00:01:23.759> shirts<00:01:24.119> are

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:24.330 
shop linen is shirts linen shirts are

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:26.330 
shop linen is shirts linen shirts are
awesome<00:01:24.900> I<00:01:25.049> think<00:01:25.140> they're<00:01:25.740> just<00:01:25.890> so<00:01:26.100> breezy

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:26.340 
awesome I think they're just so breezy

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:27.590 
awesome I think they're just so breezy
and<00:01:26.580> you<00:01:26.670> still<00:01:26.880> remain<00:01:27.180> kind<00:01:27.420> of<00:01:27.509> that

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:27.600 
and you still remain kind of that

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:29.719 
and you still remain kind of that
dressier<00:01:28.110> look<00:01:28.439> and<00:01:29.040> to<00:01:29.159> be<00:01:29.250> honest<00:01:29.520> I<00:01:29.579> think

00:01:29.719 --> 00:01:29.729 
dressier look and to be honest I think

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:31.280
