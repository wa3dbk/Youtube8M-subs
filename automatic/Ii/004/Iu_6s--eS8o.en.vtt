 we are there I meet Sergey Alekseevich 

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:25.710

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:27.660
 so probably not everyone had enough books not 

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:29.160
 be upset we will have a quiz 

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:31.320

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:43.290
 and secondly we made the decision to hold 

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:47.070

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:50.129

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:57.780
 spices today I am pleased to present to you 

00:00:54.480 --> 00:01:00.899
 your novel novel let's say so suffered 

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:03.300
 because I wrote it do not believe about 

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:06.750
 20 years as soon as I remembered 

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:07.619
 Macedonian I thought about why he went 

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:10.530
 on this trip 

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:10.979
 he passed more than half the world and in the middle 

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:13.770
 Asia 

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:17.280
 then it turned out to live people who 

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:19.970
 They speak a similar language with the Macedonian 

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:22.680
 have it been siblings 

00:01:19.970 --> 00:01:24.810
 Indo-European peoples turned out that 

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:27.000
 the secret is hidden in aristotle they are in 

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:29.850
 alexander of macedon i climbed on 

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:30.630
 the oven spent there the light took these put 

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:35.070
 six houses 

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:39.329
 so read it month read read 

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:41.930
 singled out this truth which spilled 

00:01:39.329 --> 00:01:46.560
 light on the march of alexander of macedon 

00:01:41.930 --> 00:01:49.890
 when he got to the point where he 

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:53.310
 together with thais the athenian burns and wes 

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:55.680
 there was a concept for what was started 

00:01:53.310 --> 00:02:00.110
 this trip to walnut 

00:01:55.680 --> 00:02:02.490
 it was one of three sources 

00:02:00.110 --> 00:02:03.570
 The oldest information about all 

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:07.320
 civilizations 

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:09.550
 ex on earth performed on 12 

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:11.890
 thousands of bull 

00:02:09.550 --> 00:02:14.620
 chickens on he went to India naturally 

00:02:11.890 --> 00:02:17.680
 in order to destroy the Vedas when 

00:02:14.620 --> 00:02:19.720
 marry Roxana roxana convinced him 

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:20.770
 principle not to go on india opened to him 

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:23.980
 eyes in essence 

00:02:20.770 --> 00:02:26.350
 said he was a toy in the wrong hands and 

00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:28.780
 his move to here 

00:02:26.350 --> 00:02:32.530
 destroy these shrines 

00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:35.680
 amazing that he died at exactly 33 years 

00:02:32.530 --> 00:02:36.910
 as you remember then christ was crucified 

00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:40.270
 at 33 years old 

00:02:36.910 --> 00:02:44.680
 then died as a martyr in my version 

00:02:40.270 --> 00:02:46.810
 he was poisoned and then a year later was 

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:50.200
 poisoned aristotle that is it 

00:02:46.810 --> 00:02:53.110
 forerunner forerunner christianity of the world 

00:02:50.200 --> 00:02:54.160
 prepared for monotheism at least in 

00:02:53.110 --> 00:02:56.770
 such aspect 

00:02:54.160 --> 00:02:59.560
 nobody considered a figure 

00:02:56.770 --> 00:03:02.560
 Macedonian everyone thought it was just 

00:02:59.560 --> 00:03:05.280
 conqueror of the world having read you 

00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:09.670
 Macedonian and having read Aristotle 

00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:10.570
 so i got it amazing i me 

00:03:09.670 --> 00:03:12.640
 I had a dream 

00:03:10.570 --> 00:03:13.800
 to come to me the Macedonian year well 

00:03:12.640 --> 00:03:17.920
 now write 

00:03:13.800 --> 00:03:19.810
 so it was a team he did not give commands 

00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:22.030
 whether to continue 

00:03:19.810 --> 00:03:25.030
 no continuation will not be yourself 

00:03:22.030 --> 00:03:27.520
 This is a secret book the more words to those 

00:03:25.030 --> 00:03:29.980
 more fog has passed activity evaluation 

00:03:27.520 --> 00:03:33.489
 that person about the axis 

00:03:29.980 --> 00:03:36.340
 will expose here there is no objective look at 

00:03:33.489 --> 00:03:39.700
 the historical figure must be gone 

00:03:36.340 --> 00:03:41.470
 not less than 20 years here's how in Macedonian 

00:03:39.700 --> 00:03:43.930
 because in this figure it is necessary 

00:03:41.470 --> 00:03:46.360
 sort through many novels i'm doing 

00:03:43.930 --> 00:03:48.489
