00:00:00.930 --> 00:00:09.720
 63% of Seoul's air pollution comes from cars 

00:00:05.430 --> 00:00:13.320
 There was a need to reduce pollutant emissions and the 

00:00:09.720 --> 00:00:17.490
 Take off diesel instead of cng bus was introduced 

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:22.529
 Currently, most of the cng buses in Seoul city buses are consequently 

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:26.640
 Fine dust concentration in 2011 at 63 micrograms per cubic meter 

00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:28.410
 44 micrograms in the Seoul metropolitan area 

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:33.600
 Contributed 

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:38.070
 But the cng bus is not on every side of the diesel bus. 

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:42.570
 According to an interim report recently released by Seoul Research Institute, six greenhouse gases 

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:46.710
 After a year in terms of carbon dioxide compared with diesel buses cng vehicle type is 

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:52.829
 There are more lines in the forest than in the bus. 

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:53.820
 Shinji is a diesel winner in the nature of the gas in his spare gas Ashtray 

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:59.370
 Ma Tang 

00:00:53.820 --> 00:01:00.510
 If you use the output layer, Tang Chavez is a little more exhausted 

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:05.610
 There is 

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:10.439
 It's easy to say that the cng bus is rather disadvantageous if you climb the earth . 

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:15.170
 Moreover, the development of technology has developed stunned vehicles with less smoke 

00:01:10.439 --> 00:01:18.240
 Diesel busses, which are called clean diesel in developed countries and produce less pollution , 

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:21.000
 It is being followed by public transportation. 

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:25.259
 Therefore, the worries of the city are deepening. 

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:31.290
 The early replacement of the fearful cng bus is coming soon 

00:01:25.259 --> 00:01:38.670
 After reviewing the environmental benefits and then the benefits of gear change 

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:43.979
 The thing that should be decided on the car is now that the poet delayed methane Shen 

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:49.890
 Just because we come from the zipper , we djd good 

00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:52.190
 Or if the cng judges that the vehicle is good, 

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:56.390
 There is difficulty 

00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:56.960
 On the other hand , the next month, when the final report of Seoul Research Institute comes out, 

00:01:56.390 --> 00:02:01.940
 Open 

00:01:56.960 --> 00:02:03.320
 A comprehensive review of the economic and environmental safety of cng and diesel buses 

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:06.670
 It will be done 

00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:06.670
 Tibet is right.
