00:00:25.670 --> 00:00:25.680 
there the nisshin is the other side on

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:27.980 
there the nisshin is the other side on
this<00:00:25.890> side<00:00:26.099> of<00:00:26.130> the<00:00:26.310> bike<00:00:26.460> we've<00:00:26.699> got<00:00:26.849> a<00:00:26.960> we<00:00:27.960> got

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:27.990 
this side of the bike we've got a we got

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:34.459 
this side of the bike we've got a we got
a<00:00:28.140> cover<00:00:28.439> that<00:00:28.650> covers<00:00:29.039> the<00:00:30.890> rear<00:00:33.469> brake

00:00:34.459 --> 00:00:34.469 
a cover that covers the rear brake

00:00:34.469 --> 00:00:42.529 
a cover that covers the rear brake
cylinder<00:00:35.630> reservoir<00:00:37.100> and<00:00:38.100> the<00:00:38.460> fuse<00:00:38.700> box

00:00:42.529 --> 00:00:42.539 

00:00:42.539 --> 00:00:45.130 

and<00:00:42.890> a<00:00:43.890> key<00:00:44.100> to<00:00:44.129> get<00:00:44.489> the<00:00:44.519> seed<00:00:44.789> of

00:00:45.130 --> 00:00:45.140 
and a key to get the seed of

00:00:45.140 --> 00:00:48.340 
and a key to get the seed of
five-millimeter<00:00:46.519> key<00:00:47.519> to<00:00:47.670> get<00:00:47.820> the<00:00:47.850> seed<00:00:48.149> off

00:00:48.340 --> 00:00:48.350 
five-millimeter key to get the seed off

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:51.829 
five-millimeter key to get the seed off
which<00:00:49.350> is<00:00:50.059> not<00:00:51.059> going<00:00:51.239> to<00:00:51.329> do<00:00:51.390> much<00:00:51.600> more<00:00:51.780> than

00:00:51.829 --> 00:00:51.839 
which is not going to do much more than

00:00:51.839 --> 00:00:54.459 
which is not going to do much more than
scratch<00:00:52.229> the<00:00:52.409> fender<00:00:52.769> so<00:00:53.699> it's<00:00:53.850> best<00:00:54.059> to<00:00:54.180> get<00:00:54.359> a

00:00:54.459 --> 00:00:54.469 
scratch the fender so it's best to get a

00:00:54.469 --> 00:00:58.969 
scratch the fender so it's best to get a
extension<00:00:56.210> it<00:00:57.210> reaches<00:00:57.750> above<00:00:58.019> the<00:00:58.289> taillight

00:00:58.969 --> 00:00:58.979 
extension it reaches above the taillight

00:00:58.979 --> 00:01:01.399 
extension it reaches above the taillight
and<00:00:59.250> gets<00:00:59.549> to<00:00:59.699> the<00:00:59.729> two<00:01:00.030> five<00:01:00.869> millimeter

00:01:01.399 --> 00:01:01.409 
and gets to the two five millimeter

00:01:01.409 --> 00:01:05.270 
and gets to the two five millimeter
allen<00:01:02.000> keys<00:01:03.000> allen<00:01:03.710> screws<00:01:04.710> that<00:01:04.979> hold<00:01:05.190> the

00:01:05.270 --> 00:01:05.280 
allen keys allen screws that hold the

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:08.930 
allen keys allen screws that hold the
cedar<00:01:06.830> start<00:01:07.830> in<00:01:07.979> the<00:01:08.100> emergency<00:01:08.670> I<00:01:08.700> guess

00:01:08.930 --> 00:01:08.940 
cedar start in the emergency I guess

00:01:08.940 --> 00:01:28.870 
cedar start in the emergency I guess
it's<00:01:09.119> okay

00:01:28.870 --> 00:01:28.880 

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:31.190 

so<00:01:29.880> underneath<00:01:30.150> we<00:01:30.450> got<00:01:30.570> the<00:01:30.660> battery<00:01:30.990> in<00:01:31.170> the

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:31.200 
so underneath we got the battery in the

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:34.700 
so underneath we got the battery in the
engine<00:01:31.560> control<00:01:31.740> module<00:01:33.710> pretty

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:34.710 
engine control module pretty

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:39.110 
engine control module pretty
straightforward<00:01:36.830> and<00:01:37.830> another<00:01:38.490> cover<00:01:38.790> on<00:01:39.000> the

00:01:43.790 --> 00:01:43.800 
left-hand side of the bike that was the

00:01:43.800 --> 00:01:46.460 
left-hand side of the bike that was the
air<00:01:43.950> box<00:01:44.510> the<00:01:45.510> air<00:01:45.660> intake<00:01:46.020> which<00:01:46.170> is<00:01:46.290> right

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:46.470 
air box the air intake which is right

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:51.140 
air box the air intake which is right
here<00:01:46.520> into<00:01:47.520> the<00:01:47.640> air<00:01:47.820> box<00:01:48.000> and<00:01:49.670> on<00:01:50.670> this<00:01:50.850> side

00:01:51.140 --> 00:01:51.150 
here into the air box and on this side

00:01:51.150 --> 00:01:54.400 
here into the air box and on this side
we<00:01:51.390> also<00:01:51.510> got<00:01:51.780> the<00:01:51.870> choke<00:01:52.080> two<00:01:52.830> positions

00:01:54.400 --> 00:01:54.410 
we also got the choke two positions

00:01:54.410 --> 00:01:58.820 
we also got the choke two positions
anything<00:01:55.520> 77<00:01:56.520> degrees<00:01:56.790> and<00:01:56.970> above<00:01:57.560> and<00:01:58.560> then

00:01:58.820 --> 00:01:58.830 
anything 77 degrees and above and then

00:01:58.830 --> 00:02:11.270 
anything 77 degrees and above and then
colder<00:01:59.520> than<00:01:59.670> that

00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:34.590 
SE and not on the regular Bonneville so

00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:36.500 
SE and not on the regular Bonneville so
maybe<00:02:34.740> it<00:02:34.890> lights<00:02:35.100> no<00:02:35.670> fuel<00:02:36.000> gauge<00:02:36.240> which

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:36.510 
maybe it lights no fuel gauge which

00:02:36.510 --> 00:02:38.840 
maybe it lights no fuel gauge which
would<00:02:36.690> be<00:02:36.810> nice<00:02:37.069> but<00:02:38.069> the<00:02:38.190> idiot<00:02:38.459> light<00:02:38.580> comes

00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:38.850 
would be nice but the idiot light comes

00:02:38.850 --> 00:02:43.550 
would be nice but the idiot light comes
on<00:02:39.060> at<00:02:39.290> down<00:02:40.290> one<00:02:41.010> u.s.<00:02:41.340> gallon<00:02:42.319> so<00:02:43.319> you<00:02:43.410> have

00:02:43.550 --> 00:02:43.560 
on at down one u.s. gallon so you have

00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:55.420 
on at down one u.s. gallon so you have
to<00:02:43.650> keep<00:02:43.800> an<00:02:43.950> eye<00:02:44.040> on<00:02:44.069> it

two<00:02:56.269> screws<00:02:56.540> here<00:02:56.840> that<00:02:56.900> hold<00:02:57.200> the<00:02:57.379> seed<00:02:58.040> on<00:02:58.269> so

00:02:59.259 --> 00:02:59.269 
two screws here that hold the seed on so

00:02:59.269 --> 00:03:01.000 
two screws here that hold the seed on so
you<00:02:59.360> need<00:02:59.510> to<00:02:59.629> be<00:02:59.720> able<00:02:59.780> to<00:02:59.870> get<00:03:00.049> in<00:03:00.170> here<00:03:00.500> with

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:01.010 
you need to be able to get in here with

00:03:01.010 --> 00:03:03.610 
you need to be able to get in here with
a<00:03:01.040> short<00:03:01.340> hex<00:03:02.030> key<00:03:02.299> they<00:03:02.450> give<00:03:02.629> you<00:03:02.780> you<00:03:03.349> end<00:03:03.470> up

00:03:03.610 --> 00:03:03.620 
a short hex key they give you you end up

00:03:03.620 --> 00:03:07.300 
a short hex key they give you you end up
scratching<00:03:03.950> this<00:03:05.409> but<00:03:06.409> as<00:03:06.860> I<00:03:06.980> said<00:03:07.040> an
