00:01:20.499 --> 00:01:20.509 
so first thing we do looks like we just

00:01:20.509 --> 00:01:25.539 
so first thing we do looks like we just
loop<00:01:20.810> this<00:01:20.990> around<00:01:21.049> there<00:01:21.619> and<00:01:24.220> put<00:01:25.220> all<00:01:25.340> the

00:01:25.539 --> 00:01:25.549 
loop this around there and put all the

00:01:25.549 --> 00:01:27.789 
loop this around there and put all the
seams<00:01:25.850> match<00:01:26.240> them<00:01:26.540> all<00:01:26.689> up<00:01:26.869> this<00:01:27.290> part<00:01:27.590> here

00:03:47.520 --> 00:03:47.530 
we do to give you an idea of how to do

00:03:47.530 --> 00:03:49.259 
we do to give you an idea of how to do
it<00:03:47.560> basically<00:03:48.400> you're<00:03:48.730> just<00:03:48.760> going<00:03:48.910> to<00:03:49.030> use

00:03:49.259 --> 00:03:49.269 
it basically you're just going to use

00:03:49.269 --> 00:03:51.059 
it basically you're just going to use
your<00:03:49.300> common<00:03:49.810> sense<00:03:49.840> a<00:03:50.140> little<00:03:50.290> bit<00:03:50.410> if<00:03:50.739> you

00:03:51.059 --> 00:03:51.069 
your common sense a little bit if you

00:03:51.069 --> 00:03:53.460 
your common sense a little bit if you
see<00:03:51.580> that<00:03:51.850> there's<00:03:52.209> absolutely<00:03:52.360> no<00:03:52.870> way<00:03:53.110> you

00:03:53.460 --> 00:03:53.470 
see that there's absolutely no way you

00:03:53.470 --> 00:03:55.830 
see that there's absolutely no way you
can<00:03:53.620> fit<00:03:53.800> it<00:03:53.920> through<00:03:53.950> here<00:03:54.269> this<00:03:55.269> being<00:03:55.630> the

00:03:55.830 --> 00:03:55.840 
can fit it through here this being the

00:03:55.840 --> 00:03:58.440 
can fit it through here this being the
the<00:03:56.170> bungee<00:03:57.100> cord<00:03:57.310> elastic<00:03:57.760> on<00:03:57.880> this<00:03:58.030> one<00:03:58.209> here

00:03:58.440 --> 00:03:58.450 
the bungee cord elastic on this one here

00:03:58.450 --> 00:04:01.370 
the bungee cord elastic on this one here
then<00:03:59.170> don't<00:03:59.440> all<00:03:59.769> you<00:04:00.010> do<00:04:00.160> is<00:04:00.340> you<00:04:00.430> take<00:04:00.610> it<00:04:00.790> up

tension<00:06:04.199> as<00:06:04.409> we<00:06:04.560> need<00:06:04.800> then<00:06:05.729> we<00:06:05.849> attach<00:06:06.120> these

00:06:06.350 --> 00:06:06.360 
tension as we need then we attach these

00:06:06.360 --> 00:06:09.320 
tension as we need then we attach these
elastics<00:06:06.870> with<00:06:07.020> some<00:06:07.169> s<00:06:07.289> clips<00:06:08.060> okay<00:06:09.060> so<00:06:09.120> we've

00:06:09.320 --> 00:06:09.330 
elastics with some s clips okay so we've

00:06:09.330 --> 00:06:11.890 
elastics with some s clips okay so we've
got<00:06:09.360> the<00:06:09.629> s<00:06:09.719> hooks<00:06:10.020> here<00:06:10.259> I'm<00:06:10.500> just<00:06:11.339> going<00:06:11.669> to

again you hook on the small one on the

00:06:14.189 --> 00:06:16.640 
again you hook on the small one on the
elastic<00:06:14.639> reach<00:06:15.389> underneath<00:06:15.719> and<00:06:16.080> hook<00:06:16.560> them

00:06:16.640 --> 00:06:16.650 
elastic reach underneath and hook them

on<00:06:16.969> nice<00:06:17.969> and<00:06:18.210> easy<00:06:18.330> nice<00:06:18.629> and<00:06:18.930> quick

00:06:23.130 --> 00:06:23.140 

00:06:23.140 --> 00:06:25.570 

try<00:06:24.140> to<00:06:24.200> put<00:06:24.380> these<00:06:24.500> ones<00:06:24.680> out<00:06:24.830> too<00:06:25.100> to<00:06:25.460> the

00:06:25.570 --> 00:06:25.580 
try to put these ones out too to the

00:06:25.580 --> 00:06:26.980 
try to put these ones out too to the
edge<00:06:25.730> just<00:06:25.760> to<00:06:26.150> pull<00:06:26.360> this<00:06:26.510> nice<00:06:26.750> and<00:06:26.780> tight

00:06:26.980 --> 00:06:26.990 
edge just to pull this nice and tight

00:06:26.990 --> 00:06:28.750 
edge just to pull this nice and tight
and<00:06:27.560> what<00:06:27.680> that<00:06:27.830> does<00:06:27.980> is<00:06:28.100> it<00:06:28.190> keeps<00:06:28.310> the<00:06:28.460> front

00:06:28.750 --> 00:06:28.760 
and what that does is it keeps the front

00:06:28.760 --> 00:06:33.370 
and what that does is it keeps the front
of<00:06:28.850> it<00:06:28.940> from<00:06:29.090> wrinkling<00:06:29.510> as<00:06:29.690> well<00:06:32.140> try<00:06:33.140> to<00:06:33.170> give

00:06:33.370 --> 00:06:33.380 
of it from wrinkling as well try to give

00:06:33.380 --> 00:06:34.360 
of it from wrinkling as well try to give
them<00:06:33.500> a<00:06:33.560> little<00:06:33.770> bit<00:06:33.890> of<00:06:33.920> pressure<00:06:34.130> you<00:06:34.340> don't

00:06:34.360 --> 00:06:34.370 
them a little bit of pressure you don't

00:06:34.370 --> 00:06:36.490 
them a little bit of pressure you don't
want<00:06:34.670> to<00:06:34.760> go<00:06:34.880> crazy<00:06:35.120> but<00:06:35.930> give<00:06:36.140> them<00:06:36.200> a<00:06:36.260> little

00:06:36.490 --> 00:06:36.500

00:06:36.500 --> 00:06:37.420 
want to go crazy but give them a little
bit<00:06:36.590> of<00:06:36.620> pressure<00:06:36.800> because<00:06:37.070> that's<00:06:37.220> going<00:06:37.370> to

00:06:37.420 --> 00:06:37.430 
bit of pressure because that's going to

00:06:37.430 --> 00:06:40.060 
bit of pressure because that's going to
be<00:06:37.550> holding<00:06:37.910> your<00:06:37.940> seat<00:06:38.360> cover<00:06:38.570> on<00:06:38.710> there<00:06:39.710> so

00:06:41.770 --> 00:06:41.780 
it doesn't take much with these three

00:06:41.780 --> 00:06:42.970 
it doesn't take much with these three
elastics<00:06:42.230> holding<00:06:42.470> them<00:06:42.590> on<00:06:42.650> there<00:06:42.800> you<00:06:42.890> can

00:06:42.970 --> 00:06:42.980 
elastics holding them on there you can

00:06:42.980 --> 00:06:45.130 
elastics holding them on there you can
feel<00:06:43.210> that's<00:06:44.210> a<00:06:44.300> lot<00:06:44.450> of<00:06:44.540> tension<00:06:44.750> that's

00:06:45.130 --> 00:06:45.140 
feel that's a lot of tension that's

00:06:45.140 --> 00:06:48.090 
feel that's a lot of tension that's
going<00:06:45.320> to<00:06:45.380> hold<00:06:45.500> your<00:06:45.710> seat<00:06:45.890> back<00:06:46.070> there<00:06:46.720> okay

00:06:54.460 --> 00:06:54.470 
I'd push the bungee cord elastic through

00:06:54.470 --> 00:06:56.620 
I'd push the bungee cord elastic through
there<00:06:54.680> I<00:06:54.860> push<00:06:55.310> it<00:06:55.460> down<00:06:55.490> I<00:06:55.640> yanked<00:06:56.360> about

00:06:56.620 --> 00:06:56.630 
there I push it down I yanked about

00:06:56.630 --> 00:06:59.110 
there I push it down I yanked about
about<00:06:57.290> five<00:06:57.590> inches<00:06:58.010> of<00:06:58.070> slack<00:06:58.580> and<00:06:58.850> then<00:06:58.910> put

about five inches of slack and then put

00:06:59.120 --> 00:07:00.460 
about five inches of slack and then put
it<00:06:59.240> through<00:06:59.390> there<00:06:59.600> and<00:06:59.780> it<00:06:59.930> dropped<00:07:00.230> right
