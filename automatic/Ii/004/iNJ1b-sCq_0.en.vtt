00:00:01.939 --> 00:00:05.930
 the effects of our dependence on 

00:00:04.290 --> 00:00:07.820
 the automobile are multiple and complex 

00:00:05.930 --> 00:00:10.139
 atmospheric and noise pollution 

00:00:07.820 --> 00:00:12.509
 global warming or a sedentary lifestyle 

00:00:10.139 --> 00:00:14.280
 the concepts may seem theoretical 

00:00:12.509 --> 00:00:16.529
 yet their consequences on 

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:17.220
 humans are real we talk more 

00:00:16.529 --> 00:00:19.470
 in the future 

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:22.020
 in Paris a big wave of assault their 

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:24.600
 in 2003 but here in quebec 

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:26.519
 estrie in 2010 a wave not the same 

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:29.490
 magnitude but still that lasted five 

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:31.230
 six days and with leaps 32 33 and 

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:34.340
 during this wave of water in Quebec we have 

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:36.450
 listed an excess of about 300 deaths 

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:38.700
 during this week some who have 

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:41.190
 been attributable to the heat wave 

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:43.140
 another example we found a link 

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:44.640
 between premature births and the 

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:46.829
 atmospheric pollution related to 

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:47.910
 the automobile I conducted this study with 

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:49.800
 collaborators of the institute 

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:50.579
 national public health it was in 

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:52.079
 2008 

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:54.690
 is what we did is we examine 

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:57.030
 and 100 thousand births to mothers to 

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:57.719
 montreal over the course of five years 

00:00:57.030 --> 00:00:59.250
 row 

00:00:57.719 --> 00:01:00.750
 what we have seen is that the 

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:02.520
 brands lived within 200 meters 

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:05.339
 from the motorway not exposed to more 

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:06.510
 high levels of pollutants with 14% more 

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:07.409
 chances to give birth to a baby 

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:09.869
 premature 

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:11.640
 a survey conducted last year in estrie 

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:13.170
 showed that noise pollution is a 

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:13.920
 phenomenon that disturbs more than 

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:16.140
 could think it 

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:18.659
 about 15% the population you are 

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:20.759
 often or always inconvenienced by this 

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:22.770
 burnt and the source number one noise that 

00:01:20.759 --> 00:01:25.549
 was dentist is clear marc the 

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:25.549
 road traffic 

00:01:27.880 --> 00:01:32.720
 we realized that people are 

00:01:30.290 --> 00:01:34.640
 quite often complained about 

00:01:32.720 --> 00:01:36.259
 1 in 5 adults with sleep disorders 

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:37.460
 who assign us or noise to 

00:01:36.259 --> 00:01:39.170
 outside their home 

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:40.310
 so it's still not minors 

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:42.800
 is interested in sleep disorders 

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:45.560
 because the world literature though 

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:46.250
 sleep deprivation can predispose to 

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:48.560
 hypertension 

00:01:46.250 --> 00:01:50.390
 generous melissa believes that everyone can 

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:53.119
 help improve things 

00:01:50.390 --> 00:01:55.369
 by changing his habits ideally we 

00:01:53.119 --> 00:01:56.810
 would try to in our displacements all 

00:01:55.369 --> 00:01:58.630
 the days the particular to go to the 

00:01:56.810 --> 00:02:00.679
 work or school enough of 

00:01:58.630 --> 00:02:02.780
 favor alternative modes of 

00:02:00.679 --> 00:02:05.210
 transport as the active modes with 

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:08.630
 our weapons bike walking or transport in 

00:02:05.210 --> 00:02:10.250
 common or it's the carpool so 

00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:12.440
 tried to ship from three colleagues 

00:02:10.250 --> 00:02:12.950
 for sander is working for several 

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:14.690
 years 

00:02:12.950 --> 00:02:16.760
 the university of sherbrooke has 

00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:18.290
 sustainable transport a priority with 

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:20.750
 including free access to transport 

00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:22.610
 in common for these students to plan 

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:24.620
 regional sustainable mobility center 

00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:25.700
 de sherbrooke also offers a series 

00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:27.200
 concrete actions 

00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:29.570
 for sure the whole notion of 

00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:30.769
 urban planning we must rethink the 

00:02:29.570 --> 00:02:33.590
 how to develop new 

00:02:30.769 --> 00:02:36.650
 neighborhoods so that they are more 

00:02:33.590 --> 00:02:38.030
 easily accessible in fact that the 

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:40.220
 businesses and resources are 

00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:41.600
 easily accessible remotely from 

00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:44.209
 walking or by public transport its 

00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:46.400
 new neighborhoods there and then viaticum 

00:02:44.209 --> 00:02:48.830
 the notion of the street there is 

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:51.300
 develop more bike paths 

00:02:48.830 --> 00:02:52.920
 put more than one sidewalk into it more 

00:02:51.300 --> 00:02:54.570
 friendly his calf at the level of 

00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:56.970
 travel within the city 

00:02:54.570 --> 00:02:58.830
 as a doctor in public health mÃ©lissa 

00:02:56.970 --> 00:03:00.720
 generous acknowledges that the solution to 

00:02:58.830 --> 00:03:03.480
 car dependency will have to 

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:05.400
 necessarily be collective dr yes 

00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:05.970
 it's a small cardiologist something 

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:08.459
 of the kind 

00:03:05.970 --> 00:03:10.980
 as a doctor we can recommend 

00:03:08.459 --> 00:03:12.570
 to people who smoke for example 2 - 

00:03:10.980 --> 00:03:14.400
 smoke to protect their health 

00:03:12.570 --> 00:03:16.290
 one can order to the population 

00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:17.340
 stopped breathing to protect himself from 

00:03:16.290 --> 00:03:18.390
 atmospheric pollution 

00:03:17.340 --> 00:03:20.070
 so it's really an action 

00:03:18.390 --> 00:03:20.910
 collective need we do not have 

00:03:20.070 --> 00:03:24.560
 other solution 

00:03:20.910 --> 00:03:24.560
 we all have a role to play in this
