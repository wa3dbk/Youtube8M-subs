been trying to collect them um not full

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:29.540 
been trying to collect them um not full
collection<00:00:27.359> but<00:00:27.769> pretty<00:00:28.769> close<00:00:28.920> i<00:00:29.189> guess<00:00:29.369> i

00:00:29.540 --> 00:00:29.550 
collection but pretty close i guess i

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:32.359 
collection but pretty close i guess i
got<00:00:29.730> one<00:00:30.630> of<00:00:30.750> the<00:00:30.840> little<00:00:30.960> mini<00:00:31.260> toasts<00:00:31.890> i'm

00:00:32.359 --> 00:00:32.369 
got one of the little mini toasts i'm

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:33.560 
got one of the little mini toasts i'm
not<00:00:32.520> really<00:00:32.669> interested<00:00:32.880> in<00:00:33.120> the<00:00:33.239> big<00:00:33.390> ones

00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:33.570 
not really interested in the big ones

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:34.729 
not really interested in the big ones
but<00:00:33.690> I<00:00:33.750> thought<00:00:33.870> that<00:00:33.930> many<00:00:34.050> ones<00:00:34.380> are<00:00:34.500> really

00:00:34.729 --> 00:00:34.739 
but I thought that many ones are really

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:36.440 
but I thought that many ones are really
cute<00:00:35.010> so<00:00:35.610> they<00:00:35.730> can<00:00:35.880> really<00:00:36.000> be<00:00:36.180> used<00:00:36.300> as

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:36.450 
cute so they can really be used as

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:38.119 
cute so they can really be used as
keychains<00:00:36.630> they<00:00:37.050> have<00:00:37.170> a<00:00:37.200> little<00:00:37.500> ball<00:00:37.800> chain

00:00:38.119 --> 00:00:38.129 
keychains they have a little ball chain

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:40.369 
keychains they have a little ball chain
on<00:00:38.280> this<00:00:38.460> corner<00:00:38.850> I<00:00:38.879> believe<00:00:39.239> so<00:00:39.570> I<00:00:39.780> got<00:00:40.350> a

00:00:40.369 --> 00:00:40.379 
on this corner I believe so I got a

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:43.060 
on this corner I believe so I got a
strawberry<00:00:40.920> one<00:00:41.190> and<00:00:41.610> if<00:00:41.790> you<00:00:41.879> could<00:00:42.059> tell

00:00:43.060 --> 00:00:43.070 
strawberry one and if you could tell

00:00:43.070 --> 00:00:47.630 
strawberry one and if you could tell
it's<00:00:44.070> quite<00:00:44.430> slow<00:00:45.329> raising<00:00:46.010> so<00:00:47.010> I<00:00:47.309> actually

00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:47.640 
it's quite slow raising so I actually

of<00:02:01.860> the<00:02:01.920> white<00:02:02.159> one<00:02:02.340> is<00:02:02.579> definitely<00:02:02.909> more<00:02:05.630> like

00:02:06.620 --> 00:02:06.630 
of the white one is definitely more like

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:08.449 
of the white one is definitely more like
crust<00:02:06.960> of<00:02:07.110> toast<00:02:07.380> it's<00:02:07.799> a<00:02:07.860> little<00:02:08.099> bit<00:02:08.250> more

00:02:08.449 --> 00:02:08.459 
crust of toast it's a little bit more

00:02:08.459 --> 00:02:10.690 
crust of toast it's a little bit more
stiff<00:02:09.000> than<00:02:09.590> the

00:02:10.690 --> 00:02:10.700 
stiff than the

00:02:10.700 --> 00:02:13.030 
stiff than the
pink<00:02:10.879> one<00:02:11.090> because<00:02:11.840> when<00:02:11.959> i<00:02:12.080> squish<00:02:12.650> into<00:02:12.830> this

00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:13.040 
pink one because when i squish into this

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:16.330 
pink one because when i squish into this
I<00:02:13.220> can<00:02:13.370> definitely<00:02:13.550> feel<00:02:14.180> that<00:02:14.410> outer<00:02:15.410> crust<00:02:15.950> a

00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:16.340 
I can definitely feel that outer crust a

00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:19.210 
I can definitely feel that outer crust a
little<00:02:16.610> bit<00:02:16.760> more<00:02:16.970> prominently<00:02:17.599> so<00:02:18.069> not<00:02:19.069> the

00:03:21.670 --> 00:03:21.680 
another big white one I got two of those

00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:27.069 
another big white one I got two of those
now<00:03:23.680> also<00:03:24.680> from<00:03:24.829> Thailand<00:03:25.370> I<00:03:25.579> thought<00:03:25.850> a<00:03:26.209> large

00:03:27.069 --> 00:03:27.079 
now also from Thailand I thought a large

00:03:27.079 --> 00:03:29.500 
now also from Thailand I thought a large
toast<00:03:27.560> and<00:03:27.950> I<00:03:28.130> didn't<00:03:29.120> really<00:03:29.239> like<00:03:29.480> the

00:03:29.500 --> 00:03:29.510 
toast and I didn't really like the

00:03:29.510 --> 00:03:32.020 
toast and I didn't really like the
toasts<00:03:30.019> very<00:03:30.230> much<00:03:30.470> but<00:03:30.859> after<00:03:31.340> I<00:03:31.549> got<00:03:31.609> this

00:03:32.020 --> 00:03:32.030 
toasts very much but after I got this

00:03:32.030 --> 00:03:35.979 
toasts very much but after I got this
and<00:03:32.209> I<00:03:32.269> realize<00:03:32.569> how<00:03:33.160> soft<00:03:34.160> rising<00:03:34.880> and<00:03:35.060> may

00:03:35.979 --> 00:03:35.989 
and I realize how soft rising and may

00:03:35.989 --> 00:03:38.860 
and I realize how soft rising and may
slow<00:03:36.260> rising<00:03:36.769> and<00:03:36.950> soft<00:03:37.190> this<00:03:37.430> life<00:03:37.700> I<00:03:38.150> think<00:03:38.720> I

00:03:38.860 --> 00:03:38.870 
slow rising and soft this life I think I

00:03:38.870 --> 00:03:40.750 
slow rising and soft this life I think I
want<00:03:39.079> to<00:03:39.109> get<00:03:39.260> some<00:03:39.410> other<00:03:39.590> the<00:03:40.040> chocolate<00:03:40.549> one

00:03:40.750 --> 00:03:40.760 
want to get some other the chocolate one

00:03:40.760 --> 00:03:42.400 
want to get some other the chocolate one

00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:42.410 
and the regular when this occurs along

00:03:42.410 --> 00:03:45.129
