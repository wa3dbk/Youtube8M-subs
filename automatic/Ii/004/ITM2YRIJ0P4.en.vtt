00:00:03.430 --> 00:00:09.290
 hello good everyone here the cruch and if 

00:00:06.439 --> 00:00:12.169
 I bring you a new video of gta 5 and this 

00:00:09.290 --> 00:00:14.690
 It is a video where I teach you 

00:00:12.169 --> 00:00:17.750
 the location of a giant truck 

00:00:14.690 --> 00:00:20.210
 it's worth the largest of the game 

00:00:17.750 --> 00:00:22.460
 is the biggest now you will see it and 

00:00:20.210 --> 00:00:24.890
 we are in the quarry is worth here 

00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:25.250
 I do not know why and I'm going to tell you now 

00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:28.490
 LOL 

00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:31.640
 the location and the quarry what 

00:00:28.490 --> 00:00:33.350
 would come what is all this is worth this is 

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:35.180
 a quarry where they are doing works 

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:36.800
 apparently and good is a little 

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:39.200
 away from the city but good 

00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:40.820
 it arrives in 23 minutes we are here so 

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:42.860
 well where do we have to go then we have 

00:00:40.820 --> 00:00:46.460
 to go here at exactly this point at 

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:47.960
 sea say more centrist and we will 

00:00:46.460 --> 00:00:50.320
 get to pick up my car that is a 

00:00:47.960 --> 00:00:54.030
 little torn because he just does 

00:00:50.320 --> 00:00:56.710
 a race 

00:00:54.030 --> 00:01:00.700
 to pay it 

00:00:56.710 --> 00:01:03.489
 and let's go there, apart from the change 

00:01:00.700 --> 00:01:05.920
 I'm also going to show you a giant 

00:01:03.489 --> 00:01:08.530
 crane a crane that you can mess up too 

00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:10.300
 around the city taking cars 

00:01:08.530 --> 00:01:14.010
 pulling then out there we go what 

00:01:10.300 --> 00:01:16.640
 you want to do well 

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:16.640
 s 

00:01:16.690 --> 00:01:20.250
 sounding something weird here 

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:33.560
 goodbye and good here we have what it would be 

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:38.840
 the giant truck as you see 

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:43.009
 you have to jump to get to him and 

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:44.790
 everything and it is giant that is to say it has this 

00:01:43.009 --> 00:01:46.470
 alarm or 

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:50.210
 said 

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:53.310
 and this obviously 

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:57.439
 it will not run 

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:57.439
 let's run nothing 

00:01:58.090 --> 00:02:01.840
 although good this truck could also 

00:02:00.009 --> 00:02:03.579
 find more or less by the beginning 

00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:05.649
 but this I think it has no radio 

00:02:03.579 --> 00:02:08.679
 so if you have the radio to be able to change 

00:02:05.649 --> 00:02:11.550
 we go good truck assumes that this is 

00:02:08.679 --> 00:02:11.550
 to work nothing cojones 

00:02:11.950 --> 00:02:17.319
 well here we have the biggest truck 

00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:20.849
 of the game, it's worth, I've done a smash 

00:02:17.319 --> 00:02:25.290
 We're going to the touch and well now I'm going to 

00:02:20.849 --> 00:02:25.290
 show you where the 

00:02:26.290 --> 00:02:31.989
 the crane of the crane that you already know what 

00:02:29.319 --> 00:02:36.150
 is a crane fuck so now we 

00:02:31.989 --> 00:02:36.150
 we see vale and now I have the location 

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:41.010
 and well after a little while looking for it 

00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:44.130
 because you think I was in a place 

00:02:41.010 --> 00:02:46.940
 at the end I was in another I just saw him 

00:02:44.130 --> 00:02:46.940
 there is 

00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:54.420
 well at the end it was right where I caught 

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:56.160
 the change what has appeared and so 

00:02:54.420 --> 00:02:58.770
 seen no more than you can catch by day 

00:02:56.160 --> 00:03:01.170
 it was exactly where the other was 

00:02:58.770 --> 00:03:03.780
 truck so to see how are you going 

00:03:01.170 --> 00:03:06.060
 here now without dying 

00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:09.989
 I'm going to see, I took the car 

00:03:06.060 --> 00:03:14.000
 although I have time to go to the 

00:03:09.989 --> 00:03:14.000
 parachute would be a shit 

00:03:16.060 --> 00:03:21.849
 you do not get to a game and you kill yourself 

00:03:19.569 --> 00:03:25.360
 come and here is the crane to throw it is what 

00:03:21.849 --> 00:03:27.720
 that said and I do not have bullets because I 

00:03:25.360 --> 00:03:31.780
 he took the police the other day 

00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:34.840
 or shit so 

00:03:31.780 --> 00:03:37.510
 we are going to 

00:03:34.840 --> 00:03:41.140
 erase evidence is worth looking for a police 

00:03:37.510 --> 00:03:43.330
 but here we have the crane is worth and this 

00:03:41.140 --> 00:03:46.810
 crane we have used it I believe if in the 

00:03:43.330 --> 00:03:50.110
 campaign we will use it and in this it goes 

00:03:46.810 --> 00:03:52.120
 to do many cool things by tying her 

00:03:50.110 --> 00:03:54.250
 against the police always in everything not 

00:03:52.120 --> 00:03:56.470
 you can always use it 

00:03:54.250 --> 00:03:59.610
 I do not know if it can be stored in a garage 

00:03:56.470 --> 00:03:59.610
 although I do not think 

00:04:00.240 --> 00:04:06.360
 and it's hyper difficult to manage so 

00:04:03.330 --> 00:04:08.520
 lucky if you want to use it against 

00:04:06.360 --> 00:04:10.080
 police to see if it comes here that I do not think 

00:04:08.520 --> 00:04:12.180
 that comes but good here you have the 

00:04:10.080 --> 00:04:13.720
 cranes I have taught the crane both the crane 

00:04:12.180 --> 00:04:16.150
 as 

00:04:13.720 --> 00:04:18.820
 We hoisted the big truck and see if it is 

00:04:16.150 --> 00:04:21.310
 big the fucking truck this fucking crane 

00:04:18.820 --> 00:04:23.140
 comes in half more or less that is 

00:04:21.310 --> 00:04:25.890
 giant the bastard to see if we can 

00:04:23.140 --> 00:04:25.890
 lift it 

00:04:29.080 --> 00:04:35.050
 no no no lifts so good here you 

00:04:32.530 --> 00:04:37.930
 I bring this video a little bit to 

00:04:35.050 --> 00:04:39.039
 show you curiosity of the game vehicles 

00:04:37.930 --> 00:04:41.169
 that you will not find the city 

00:04:39.039 --> 00:04:43.659
 easily or if you will not find it 

00:04:41.169 --> 00:04:45.099
 they are simply here I do not know 

00:04:43.659 --> 00:04:47.020
 that the stretch tells the highway an uncle 

00:04:45.099 --> 00:04:49.150
 that is working me so good 

00:04:47.020 --> 00:04:50.469
 I hope you liked a favorite line 

00:04:49.150 --> 00:04:53.849
 would help a lot and see you the 

00:04:50.469 --> 00:04:53.849
 next goodbye
