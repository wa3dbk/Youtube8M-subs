firewall that we did our top-end speed
over<00:01:07.350> the<00:01:07.380> roughest<00:01:07.860> spot<00:01:07.979> in<00:01:08.310> the<00:01:08.400> lake<00:01:08.580> and

over the roughest spot in the lake and
it<00:01:10.229> seems<00:01:10.440> like<00:01:10.619> the<00:01:10.740> faster<00:01:11.220> you<00:01:11.369> go<00:01:11.549> the

some<00:02:07.830> air<00:02:07.980> compaction<00:02:08.550> puts<00:02:08.760> you<00:02:08.880> up<00:02:08.970> to<00:02:09.090> the

00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:09.210 
some air compaction puts you up to the

00:02:09.210 --> 00:02:10.940 
some air compaction puts you up to the
top<00:02:09.480> of<00:02:09.600> the<00:02:09.690> water<00:02:09.899> and<00:02:10.170> really<00:02:10.710> smooth<00:02:10.920> the

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:10.950 
top of the water and really smooth the

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:12.980 
top of the water and really smooth the
right<00:02:11.220> out<00:02:11.370> for<00:02:11.520> you<00:02:11.580> well<00:02:11.940> I<00:02:11.970> guess<00:02:12.300> you<00:02:12.900> know

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:12.990 
right out for you well I guess you know

00:02:12.990 --> 00:02:14.450 
right out for you well I guess you know
the<00:02:13.140> like<00:02:13.320> of<00:02:13.470> the<00:02:13.530> faster<00:02:13.860> we<00:02:13.980> want<00:02:14.130> it<00:02:14.280> seemed

00:02:14.450 --> 00:02:14.460 
the like of the faster we want it seemed

00:02:14.460 --> 00:02:16.670 
the like of the faster we want it seemed
like<00:02:14.640> the<00:02:14.760> best<00:02:14.790> better<00:02:15.480> we<00:02:15.690> were<00:02:15.810> riding<00:02:16.020> you

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:16.680 
like the best better we were riding you

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:18.200 
like the best better we were riding you
know<00:02:16.770> at<00:02:16.890> our<00:02:16.920> top<00:02:17.310> speed<00:02:17.610> it<00:02:17.910> seemed<00:02:18.090> to

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:18.210 
know at our top speed it seemed to

00:02:18.210 --> 00:02:20.390 
know at our top speed it seemed to
really<00:02:18.690> are<00:02:18.900> most<00:02:19.110> comfortable<00:02:19.260> ride<00:02:19.740> right

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:20.400 
really are most comfortable ride right

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:21.530 
really are most comfortable ride right
and<00:02:20.730> the<00:02:20.790> reason<00:02:21.030> that<00:02:21.060> is<00:02:21.330> is<00:02:21.360> because

00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:21.540 
and the reason that is is because

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:23.720 
and the reason that is is because
because<00:02:22.500> of<00:02:22.620> the<00:02:22.680> big<00:02:22.860> open<00:02:23.130> mouth<00:02:23.160> we<00:02:23.520> have<00:02:23.700> a

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:23.730 
because of the big open mouth we have a

00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:25.370 
because of the big open mouth we have a
front<00:02:24.150> the<00:02:24.300> more<00:02:24.480> airflow<00:02:24.720> you<00:02:24.990> can<00:02:25.140> push

00:02:25.370 --> 00:02:25.380 
front the more airflow you can push

00:02:25.380 --> 00:02:27.110 
front the more airflow you can push
obviously<00:02:26.370> which<00:02:26.490> is<00:02:26.520> what<00:02:26.730> you're<00:02:26.850> gonna<00:02:26.940> get

00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:27.120 
obviously which is what you're gonna get

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:28.760 
obviously which is what you're gonna get
higher<00:02:27.360> speeds<00:02:27.750> the<00:02:27.960> smoother<00:02:28.260> ride<00:02:28.440> you<00:02:28.620> will

00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:28.770 
higher speeds the smoother ride you will

00:02:28.770 --> 00:02:30.500 
higher speeds the smoother ride you will
receive<00:02:29.040> well<00:02:29.490> we<00:02:29.670> also<00:02:29.850> do<00:02:30.090> differently<00:02:30.420> is

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:30.510 
receive well we also do differently is

00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:32.030 
receive well we also do differently is
we<00:02:30.570> only<00:02:30.750> use<00:02:30.930> one<00:02:31.140> motor<00:02:31.410> unlike<00:02:31.860> other

00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:32.040 
we only use one motor unlike other

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:33.699 
we only use one motor unlike other
catamaran<00:02:32.489> style<00:02:32.790> so<00:02:32.910> you<00:02:33.000> mentioned<00:02:33.510> that

00:02:33.699 --> 00:02:33.709 
catamaran style so you mentioned that

00:02:33.709 --> 00:02:36.710 
catamaran style so you mentioned that
most<00:02:34.709> catamarans<00:02:35.100> don't<00:02:35.400> turn<00:02:35.670> the<00:02:36.480> way<00:02:36.570> this

00:02:36.710 --> 00:02:36.720 
most catamarans don't turn the way this

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:38.330 
most catamarans don't turn the way this
one<00:02:36.900> does<00:02:36.930> and<00:02:37.290> that<00:02:37.620> one<00:02:37.770> motor<00:02:37.950> design

00:02:38.330 --> 00:02:38.340 
one does and that one motor design

00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:40.670 
one does and that one motor design
really<00:02:38.580> can<00:02:38.820> change<00:02:38.850> yeah<00:02:39.600> for<00:02:39.840> sure<00:02:39.959> and<00:02:40.380> you
