00:02:38.110 --> 00:02:40.980 
i think the most i've pulled out of this
game<00:02:38.380> with<00:02:39.190> recording<00:02:39.819> was<00:02:39.940> 45<00:02:40.480> frames<00:02:40.720> per

00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:40.990 
game with recording was 45 frames per

00:02:40.990 --> 00:02:44.430 
game with recording was 45 frames per
second<00:02:41.410> with<00:02:41.560> this<00:02:41.740> windowed<00:02:42.190> setting<00:02:42.690> so<00:02:43.690> if

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:44.440 
second with this windowed setting so if

00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:47.010 
second with this windowed setting so if
you<00:02:45.010> can<00:02:45.190> actually<00:02:45.370> live<00:02:46.330> with<00:02:46.569> the<00:02:46.690> windowed

00:02:47.010 --> 00:02:47.020 
you can actually live with the windowed

00:02:47.020 --> 00:02:51.930 
you can actually live with the windowed
setting<00:02:47.760> then<00:02:48.760> I<00:02:49.090> guess<00:02:49.959> this<00:02:50.680> is<00:02:50.940> something

00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:51.940 
setting then I guess this is something

00:02:51.940 --> 00:02:54.840 
setting then I guess this is something
you<00:02:52.030> would<00:02:52.150> want<00:02:52.270> to<00:02:52.360> play<00:02:52.980> but<00:02:53.980> i'm<00:02:54.400> leaving

00:02:54.840 --> 00:02:54.850 
you would want to play but i'm leaving

00:02:54.850 --> 00:02:57.390 
you would want to play but i'm leaving
this<00:02:54.880> game<00:02:55.270> for<00:02:56.080> you<00:02:56.200> to<00:02:56.350> decide<00:02:56.739> whether<00:02:57.040> or

00:02:57.390 --> 00:02:57.400 
this game for you to decide whether or

00:02:57.400 --> 00:03:00.300 
this game for you to decide whether or
not<00:02:57.790> it<00:02:58.000> is<00:02:58.030> good<00:02:58.330> for<00:02:58.540> the<00:02:58.569> surface<00:02:59.050> i<00:02:59.230> am<00:02:59.920> not

00:05:05.980 --> 00:05:05.990

most<00:05:06.110> call<00:05:06.410> of<00:05:06.530> duty's<00:05:08.169> not<00:05:09.169> so<00:05:09.410> much<00:05:09.590> of<00:05:09.620> a<00:05:09.830> fan

00:05:10.030 --> 00:05:10.040 
most call of duty's not so much of a fan

00:05:10.040 --> 00:05:12.640 
most call of duty's not so much of a fan
of<00:05:10.070> the<00:05:10.250> multiplayer<00:05:10.880> though<00:05:11.470> but<00:05:12.470> that's

00:05:12.640 --> 00:05:12.650 
of the multiplayer though but that's

00:05:12.650 --> 00:05:31.320
