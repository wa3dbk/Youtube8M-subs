you<00:02:41.209> play<00:02:41.570> any<00:02:41.750> three<00:02:42.110> four<00:02:42.760> would<00:02:43.760> play<00:02:43.910> a

00:02:43.930 --> 00:02:43.940 
you play any three four would play a

00:02:43.940 --> 00:02:47.740 
you play any three four would play a
little<00:02:44.150> bit<00:02:44.330> not<00:02:44.480> a<00:02:44.510> lot

00:02:47.740 --> 00:02:47.750 

00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:56.180 

just<00:02:48.750> one<00:02:48.930> but<00:02:49.890> you<00:02:50.010> know<00:02:54.830> for<00:02:55.830> me<00:02:55.950> it's<00:02:56.070> gonna

00:02:56.180 --> 00:02:56.190 
just one but you know for me it's gonna

00:02:56.190 --> 00:02:58.130 
just one but you know for me it's gonna
be<00:02:56.250> difficult<00:02:56.520> so<00:02:56.910> we<00:02:57.030> never<00:02:57.210> played<00:02:57.510> North

00:02:58.130 --> 00:02:58.140 
be difficult so we never played North

00:02:58.140 --> 00:02:59.510 
be difficult so we never played North
come<00:02:58.350> on<00:02:58.440> that<00:02:58.650> much<00:02:58.860> but<00:02:59.100> so<00:02:59.190> it's<00:02:59.310> gonna<00:02:59.400> be<00:02:59.490> a

00:02:59.510 --> 00:02:59.520 
come on that much but so it's gonna be a

00:02:59.520 --> 00:03:01.370 
come on that much but so it's gonna be a
learning<00:02:59.700> curve<00:02:59.880> a<00:03:00.150> little<00:03:00.240> bit<00:03:00.480> but<00:03:00.720> I<00:03:00.930> think

00:03:01.370 --> 00:03:01.380 
learning curve a little bit but I think

00:03:01.380 --> 00:03:03.020 
learning curve a little bit but I think
it's<00:03:01.680> different<00:03:01.950> so<00:03:02.280> once<00:03:02.460> you<00:03:02.550> get<00:03:02.670> into<00:03:02.850> it

00:03:03.020 --> 00:03:03.030 
it's different so once you get into it

00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:15.740 
it's different so once you get into it
you<00:03:03.180> learn<00:03:03.330> two<00:03:12.530> different<00:03:13.530> things<00:03:14.750> three

00:03:15.740 --> 00:03:15.750 
you learn two different things three

00:03:15.750 --> 00:03:17.360 
you learn two different things three
sport<00:03:16.020> no<00:03:16.110> you<00:03:16.260> play<00:03:16.410> with<00:03:16.650> Gordon<00:03:17.010> lot<00:03:17.130> more

00:03:17.360 --> 00:03:17.370 
sport no you play with Gordon lot more

00:03:17.370 --> 00:03:19.040 
sport no you play with Gordon lot more
