what<00:00:00.979> we're<00:00:01.069> going<00:00:01.160> to<00:00:01.250> do<00:00:01.339> in<00:00:01.430> this

00:00:01.510 --> 00:00:01.520 
what we're going to do in this

00:00:01.520 --> 00:00:04.240 
what we're going to do in this
demonstration<00:00:02.030> is<00:00:02.210> a<00:00:02.360> quick<00:00:02.659> overview<00:00:02.810> of<00:00:03.319> DFS

00:00:04.240 --> 00:00:04.250 
demonstration is a quick overview of DFS

00:00:04.250 --> 00:00:07.269 
demonstration is a quick overview of DFS
distributed<00:00:05.150> file<00:00:05.360> system<00:00:05.950> now<00:00:06.950> the<00:00:07.009> whole

00:00:07.269 --> 00:00:07.279 
distributed file system now the whole

00:00:07.279 --> 00:00:11.290 
distributed file system now the whole
point<00:00:07.550> of<00:00:07.730> DFS<00:00:08.299> is<00:00:08.660> too<00:00:09.350> abstract<00:00:10.300> shared

00:00:11.290 --> 00:00:11.300 
point of DFS is too abstract shared

00:00:11.300 --> 00:00:13.660 
point of DFS is too abstract shared
folders<00:00:11.780> out<00:00:11.960> on<00:00:12.080> the<00:00:12.139> network<00:00:12.670> normally

00:00:13.660 --> 00:00:13.670 
folders out on the network normally

00:00:13.670 --> 00:00:15.580 
folders out on the network normally
users<00:00:14.000> have<00:00:14.240> to<00:00:14.360> go<00:00:14.480> to<00:00:14.540> a<00:00:14.690> large<00:00:15.139> number<00:00:15.230> of

00:00:15.580 --> 00:00:15.590 
users have to go to a large number of

00:00:15.590 --> 00:00:17.560 
users have to go to a large number of
servers<00:00:15.950> to<00:00:16.340> find<00:00:16.609> all<00:00:16.789> their<00:00:16.939> shared<00:00:17.210> folders

00:00:17.560 --> 00:00:17.570 
servers to find all their shared folders

00:00:17.570 --> 00:00:20.649 
servers to find all their shared folders
with<00:00:18.380> DFS<00:00:19.009> you<00:00:19.249> can<00:00:19.400> centralize<00:00:19.999> all<00:00:20.359> the

00:00:20.649 --> 00:00:20.659 
with DFS you can centralize all the

00:00:20.659 --> 00:00:22.870 
with DFS you can centralize all the
shared<00:00:20.869> folders<00:00:21.169> they<00:00:21.289> need<00:00:21.439> to<00:00:21.529> access<00:00:21.880> into

00:00:22.870 --> 00:00:22.880 
shared folders they need to access into

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:26.019 
shared folders they need to access into
one<00:00:23.119> simple<00:00:23.569> hierarchy<00:00:24.230> so<00:00:25.130> DFS<00:00:25.609> will<00:00:25.849> open

00:00:26.019 --> 00:00:26.029 
one simple hierarchy so DFS will open

00:00:26.029 --> 00:00:28.179 
one simple hierarchy so DFS will open

that up distributed file system to set
up<00:00:28.279> DFS<00:00:28.669> you<00:00:28.880> first<00:00:29.060> set<00:00:29.239> up<00:00:29.329> a<00:00:29.479> route<00:00:29.749> a<00:00:30.050> DFS

00:00:30.669 --> 00:00:30.679 
up DFS you first set up a route a DFS

00:00:30.679 --> 00:00:33.160 
up DFS you first set up a route a DFS
route<00:00:31.009> and<00:00:31.360> users<00:00:32.360> would<00:00:32.480> connect<00:00:32.870> to<00:00:32.930> the

00:00:33.160 --> 00:00:33.170 
route and users would connect to the

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:36.190 
route and users would connect to the
route<00:00:33.410> and<00:00:33.670> then<00:00:34.670> see<00:00:35.000> all<00:00:35.270> these<00:00:35.900> shared

00:00:36.190 --> 00:00:36.200 
route and then see all these shared

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:39.590 
route and then see all these shared

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:39.600 

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:42.650 

this<00:00:40.289> example<00:00:40.649> were<00:00:40.829> to<00:00:40.949> setup<00:00:41.160> a<00:00:41.250> domain<00:00:41.660> DFS

00:00:42.650 --> 00:00:42.660 
this example were to setup a domain DFS

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:46.130 
this example were to setup a domain DFS
root<00:00:43.050> if<00:00:43.940> that's<00:00:44.940> the<00:00:45.120> case<00:00:45.300> then<00:00:45.359> it<00:00:45.809> asks<00:00:46.109> for

00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:46.140 
root if that's the case then it asks for

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:48.889 
root if that's the case then it asks for
which<00:00:46.440> domain<00:00:46.890> we<00:00:47.250> want<00:00:47.460> to<00:00:47.610> set<00:00:47.760> up<00:00:47.850> a<00:00:47.969> DFS

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:08.470 
what's the root name going to be now you
wanna<00:01:07.370> be<00:01:07.430> careful<00:01:07.820> here<00:01:08.000> look<00:01:08.300> at<00:01:08.420> the

00:01:08.470 --> 00:01:08.480 
wanna be careful here look at the

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:11.050 
wanna be careful here look at the
preview<00:01:08.960> this<00:01:09.650> is<00:01:09.770> what<00:01:09.890> users<00:01:10.280> will<00:01:10.490> type<00:01:10.760> in

00:01:11.050 --> 00:01:11.060 
preview this is what users will type in

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:14.200 
preview this is what users will type in
to<00:01:11.390> get<00:01:11.570> to<00:01:11.690> the<00:01:11.780> DFS<00:01:12.260> route<00:01:12.760> so<00:01:13.760> we<00:01:13.910> could<00:01:14.090> just

00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:14.210 
to get to the DFS route so we could just

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:17.520 
to get to the DFS route so we could just
put<00:01:14.420> how<00:01:15.080> about<00:01:15.230> info

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:17.530 
put how about info

00:01:17.530 --> 00:01:19.830 
put how about info
so<00:01:18.190> if<00:01:18.250> users<00:01:18.580> want<00:01:18.760> to<00:01:18.790> access<00:01:19.119> the<00:01:19.210> DFS<00:01:19.570> route

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:19.840 
so if users want to access the DFS route

00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:21.810 
so if users want to access the DFS route
they'll<00:01:20.470> type<00:01:20.740> in<00:01:20.920> whack<00:01:21.190> whack<00:01:21.400> West<00:01:21.670> sim

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:21.820 
they'll type in whack whack West sim

00:01:21.820 --> 00:01:24.690 
they'll type in whack whack West sim
type<00:01:22.000> private<00:01:22.180> whack<00:01:22.600> info<00:01:23.170> or<00:01:23.490> what's<00:01:24.490> more

00:01:24.690 --> 00:01:24.700 
type private whack info or what's more

00:01:24.700 --> 00:01:26.219 
type private whack info or what's more
likely<00:01:25.060> is<00:01:25.270> that<00:01:25.420> you<00:01:25.690> will<00:01:25.780> map<00:01:26.020> a<00:01:26.200> network

00:01:26.219 --> 00:01:26.229 
likely is that you will map a network

00:01:26.229 --> 00:01:29.219 
likely is that you will map a network
drive<00:01:26.590> to<00:01:27.159> that<00:01:27.310> location<00:01:27.460> for<00:01:28.000> them<00:01:28.240> she<00:01:29.110> can

00:01:29.219 --> 00:01:29.229 
drive to that location for them she can

00:01:29.229 --> 00:01:31.020 
drive to that location for them she can
call<00:01:29.320> info<00:01:29.740> you<00:01:29.890> can<00:01:29.920> call<00:01:30.040> it<00:01:30.190> DFS<00:01:30.640> and<00:01:30.670> call

call info you can call it DFS and call

00:01:31.030 --> 00:01:32.550 
call info you can call it DFS and call
it<00:01:31.090> whatever<00:01:31.210> you<00:01:31.360> want<00:01:31.540> but<00:01:31.720> be<00:01:32.290> aware<00:01:32.380> that

00:01:49.450 --> 00:01:52.250 
computer will have the DFS root share
called<00:01:49.689> info

00:01:52.250 --> 00:01:52.260 

00:01:52.260 --> 00:01:56.360 

and<00:01:53.010> we<00:01:53.220> finish

00:01:56.360 --> 00:01:56.370 

00:01:56.370 --> 00:01:59.180

going to create some DFS links so when

00:03:40.870 --> 00:03:43.259 
going to create some DFS links so when
someone<00:03:41.050> accesses<00:03:41.530> the<00:03:41.830> route<00:03:42.129> they'll<00:03:42.849> see

someone accesses the route they'll see
what<00:03:43.690> appears<00:03:44.110> to<00:03:44.260> be<00:03:44.290> subfolders<00:03:45.160> when<00:03:46.000> in

what appears to be subfolders when in

00:03:46.120 --> 00:03:48.360 
what appears to be subfolders when in
fact<00:03:46.150> those<00:03:46.599> subfolders<00:03:47.170> could<00:03:47.860> be<00:03:47.950> pointed

00:03:48.360 --> 00:03:48.370 
fact those subfolders could be pointed

00:03:48.370 --> 00:03:50.400 
fact those subfolders could be pointed
towards<00:03:48.670> shared<00:03:48.940> folder<00:03:49.300> spread<00:03:49.540> out<00:03:49.900> on<00:03:50.140> the

towards shared folder spread out on the

00:03:50.410 --> 00:03:52.559 
towards shared folder spread out on the
network<00:03:50.670> so<00:03:51.670> you<00:03:51.730> right-click<00:03:52.060> the<00:03:52.090> root<00:03:52.330> you

00:03:52.559 --> 00:03:52.569 
network so you right-click the root you

00:03:52.569 --> 00:03:55.559

reports and I shared out sales data as
just<00:04:29.130> sales<00:04:29.640> that's<00:04:30.090> the<00:04:30.240> share<00:04:30.510> names<00:04:30.750> the

00:04:30.980 --> 00:04:30.990 
just sales that's the share names the

00:04:30.990 --> 00:04:33.330 
just sales that's the share names the
share<00:04:31.260> name<00:04:31.440> is<00:04:31.590> sales

00:04:33.330 --> 00:04:33.340 
share name is sales

00:04:33.340 --> 00:04:38.559 
share name is sales
sales<00:04:34.240> data<00:04:34.780> is<00:04:35.169> the<00:04:35.560> folder<00:04:36.310> name

00:04:38.559 --> 00:04:38.569 

00:04:38.569 --> 00:04:40.749 

and<00:04:38.659> for<00:04:38.990> link<00:04:39.229> name<00:04:39.589> let's<00:04:40.099> change<00:04:40.460> that

00:04:40.749 --> 00:04:40.759 
and for link name let's change that

00:04:40.759 --> 00:04:43.480 
and for link name let's change that
let's<00:04:41.059> change<00:04:41.240> that<00:04:41.479> to

00:04:43.480 --> 00:04:43.490 
let's change that to

00:04:43.490 --> 00:04:47.380 
let's change that to
sales<00:04:44.419> information

00:04:47.380 --> 00:04:47.390 

00:04:47.390 --> 00:04:49.710 

so<00:04:48.050> the<00:04:48.140> path<00:04:48.350> is<00:04:48.590> going<00:04:48.740> to<00:04:48.800> be<00:04:48.860> whack<00:04:49.040> whack

00:04:49.710 --> 00:04:49.720 
so the path is going to be whack whack

00:04:49.720 --> 00:04:53.400 
so the path is going to be whack whack
sls<00:04:50.720> RV<00:04:51.020> three<00:04:51.320> is<00:04:51.470> the<00:04:51.710> server<00:04:51.980> name<00:04:52.070> black

00:04:53.400 --> 00:04:53.410 
sls RV three is the server name black

00:04:53.410 --> 00:04:56.810 
sls RV three is the server name black
sails<00:04:54.410> was<00:04:54.770> the<00:04:54.920> share<00:04:55.250> name

00:04:56.810 --> 00:04:56.820 
sails was the share name

00:04:56.820 --> 00:04:59.720 
sails was the share name
so<00:04:57.480> again<00:04:57.660> let's<00:04:57.810> clarify<00:04:58.050> this<00:04:58.460> the<00:04:59.460> actual

00:04:59.720 --> 00:04:59.730 
so again let's clarify this the actual

00:04:59.730 --> 00:05:01.910 
so again let's clarify this the actual
folder<00:05:00.420> containing<00:05:01.170> the<00:05:01.290> data<00:05:01.320> is<00:05:01.680> called

00:05:01.910 --> 00:05:01.920 
folder containing the data is called

00:05:01.920 --> 00:05:06.050 
folder containing the data is called
sales<00:05:02.190> data<00:05:03.170> the<00:05:04.170> share<00:05:04.620> folder<00:05:05.370> name<00:05:05.820> is

00:05:06.050 --> 00:05:06.060 
sales data the share folder name is

00:05:06.060 --> 00:05:09.180 
sales data the share folder name is
different<00:05:06.510> the<00:05:06.720> share<00:05:06.990> name<00:05:07.200> is<00:05:07.320> just<00:05:07.530> sales

00:05:09.180 --> 00:05:09.190 
different the share name is just sales

00:05:09.190 --> 00:05:12.120 
different the share name is just sales
the<00:05:09.430> DFS<00:05:09.940> link<00:05:10.420> name<00:05:10.750> is<00:05:10.990> sales<00:05:11.290> information

00:05:12.120 --> 00:05:12.130 
the DFS link name is sales information

00:05:12.130 --> 00:05:13.770 
the DFS link name is sales information
so<00:05:12.310> we<00:05:12.370> have<00:05:12.460> three<00:05:12.790> different<00:05:12.820> names<00:05:13.420> to<00:05:13.630> keep

00:05:13.770 --> 00:05:13.780 
so we have three different names to keep

00:05:13.780 --> 00:05:16.650 
so we have three different names to keep
track<00:05:14.020> of<00:05:14.520> sales<00:05:15.520> information<00:05:16.270> is<00:05:16.390> what<00:05:16.540> the

00:05:16.650 --> 00:05:16.660 
track of sales information is what the

00:05:16.660 --> 00:05:19.560 
track of sales information is what the
users<00:05:17.020> will<00:05:17.230> see<00:05:17.670> sales<00:05:18.670> is<00:05:19.060> what<00:05:19.210> someone

00:05:19.560 --> 00:05:19.570 
users will see sales is what someone

00:05:19.570 --> 00:05:23.340 
users will see sales is what someone
browsing<00:05:20.380> the<00:05:20.410> network<00:05:20.860> would<00:05:21.130> see<00:05:22.350> sales

00:05:23.340 --> 00:05:23.350 
browsing the network would see sales

00:05:23.350 --> 00:05:25.080 
browsing the network would see sales
data<00:05:23.740> is<00:05:24.040> with<00:05:24.190> somebody<00:05:24.490> sitting<00:05:24.760> at<00:05:24.940> this

00:05:25.080 --> 00:05:25.090 
data is with somebody sitting at this

00:05:25.090 --> 00:05:27.360 
data is with somebody sitting at this
computer<00:05:25.170> accessing<00:05:26.170> these<00:05:26.290> hard<00:05:27.100> drives

00:05:27.360 --> 00:05:27.370 
computer accessing these hard drives

00:05:27.370 --> 00:05:30.340 
computer accessing these hard drives
would<00:05:27.760> see

00:05:30.340 --> 00:05:30.350 

00:05:30.350 --> 00:05:33.520 

so<00:05:30.950> back<00:05:31.130> to<00:05:31.280> our<00:05:31.310> DFS<00:05:31.850> link<00:05:32.180> wizard<00:05:32.510> here<00:05:32.780> so

00:05:33.520 --> 00:05:33.530 
so back to our DFS link wizard here so

00:05:33.530 --> 00:05:36.400 
so back to our DFS link wizard here so
there's<00:05:33.830> the<00:05:34.010> path<00:05:34.280> to<00:05:34.580> our<00:05:34.610> target<00:05:35.000> and<00:05:35.480> will

00:05:36.400 --> 00:05:36.410 
there's the path to our target and will

00:05:36.410 --> 00:05:44.860 
there's the path to our target and will
say<00:05:36.530> this<00:05:36.650> is<00:05:36.860> our<00:05:37.190> DFS<00:05:38.090> link

00:05:44.860 --> 00:05:44.870 

00:05:44.870 --> 00:05:48.010 

so<00:05:45.500> there's<00:05:45.770> the<00:05:45.980> DFS<00:05:46.400> link<00:05:46.810> there<00:05:47.810> is<00:05:47.900> the

00:05:48.010 --> 00:05:48.020 
so there's the DFS link there is the

00:05:48.020 --> 00:05:50.440 
so there's the DFS link there is the
actual<00:05:48.350> target<00:05:48.980> black<00:05:49.550> wax<00:05:49.820> servername<00:05:50.150> wax

00:05:50.440 --> 00:05:50.450 
actual target black wax servername wax

sales data with four quarterly sales

00:06:02.630 --> 00:06:04.270 
sales data with four quarterly sales
reports<00:06:03.080> we'll<00:06:03.530> see<00:06:03.680> if<00:06:03.740> that's<00:06:03.830> what<00:06:04.010> we<00:06:04.100> get

00:06:04.270 --> 00:06:04.280

we<00:06:04.490> browse<00:06:04.970> the<00:06:05.240> shared<00:06:05.480> folder<00:06:05.920> in<00:06:06.920> the<00:06:07.910> root

00:06:08.140 --> 00:06:08.150 
we browse the shared folder in the root

00:06:08.150 --> 00:06:09.970 
we browse the shared folder in the root
we<00:06:08.570> see<00:06:08.750> the<00:06:08.870> document<00:06:09.350> in<00:06:09.470> the<00:06:09.560> root<00:06:09.710> share

00:06:09.970 --> 00:06:09.980 
we see the document in the root share

00:06:09.980 --> 00:06:13.000 
we see the document in the root share
and<00:06:10.190> we<00:06:10.700> see<00:06:10.880> sales<00:06:11.210> information<00:06:11.920> opening<00:06:12.920> up

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:13.010 
and we see sales information opening up

00:06:13.010 --> 00:06:14.650 
and we see sales information opening up
sales<00:06:13.250> information<00:06:13.490> we<00:06:13.940> see<00:06:14.120> the<00:06:14.270> quarterly

00:06:14.650 --> 00:06:14.660 
sales information we see the quarterly

00:06:14.660 --> 00:06:17.830 
sales information we see the quarterly
sales<00:06:14.840> reports<00:06:15.640> now<00:06:16.640> to<00:06:16.700> the<00:06:17.000> user<00:06:17.270> again<00:06:17.690> it

00:06:17.830 --> 00:06:17.840 
sales reports now to the user again it

00:06:17.840 --> 00:06:19.900 
sales reports now to the user again it
appears<00:06:17.960> as<00:06:18.560> though<00:06:18.590> sales<00:06:19.220> information<00:06:19.490> is<00:06:19.880> a

00:06:19.900 --> 00:06:19.910 
appears as though sales information is a

00:06:19.910 --> 00:06:23.020 
appears as though sales information is a
subfolder<00:06:20.590> right<00:06:21.590> there<00:06:21.860> at<00:06:21.950> the<00:06:22.010> root<00:06:22.280> when

00:06:23.020 --> 00:06:23.030 
subfolder right there at the root when

00:06:23.030 --> 00:06:25.990 
subfolder right there at the root when
in<00:06:23.150> fact<00:06:23.260> that<00:06:24.260> share<00:06:24.770> information<00:06:25.610> could

00:06:25.990 --> 00:06:26.000 
in fact that share information could

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:27.720 
in fact that share information could
have<00:06:26.150> come<00:06:26.390> from<00:06:26.420> anywhere<00:06:26.900> on<00:06:27.080> the<00:06:27.350> network

00:06:27.720 --> 00:06:27.730 
have come from anywhere on the network

00:06:27.730 --> 00:06:30.250 
have come from anywhere on the network
so<00:06:28.730> it's<00:06:28.850> making<00:06:29.120> things<00:06:29.150> look<00:06:29.420> very<00:06:29.540> nice<00:06:30.020> and

00:06:30.250 --> 00:06:30.260 
so it's making things look very nice and

00:06:30.260 --> 00:06:32.350 
so it's making things look very nice and
easy<00:06:30.380> for<00:06:30.680> the<00:06:30.740> users<00:06:31.040> when<00:06:31.880> behind<00:06:32.240> the

easy for the users when behind the

easy for the users when behind the

actually technically DFS is redirecting

00:06:40.970 --> 00:06:43.150 
actually technically DFS is redirecting

shared<00:06:43.400> folder<00:06:43.460> to<00:06:43.850> the<00:06:43.880> information

00:06:46.540 --> 00:06:46.550 

00:06:46.550 --> 00:06:50.020 

so<00:06:47.210> we'll<00:06:47.330> set<00:06:47.450> up<00:06:47.480> a<00:06:47.600> second<00:06:48.050> link

00:06:50.020 --> 00:06:50.030 
so we'll set up a second link

00:06:50.030 --> 00:06:56.010 
so we'll set up a second link
this<00:06:50.630> will<00:06:50.780> be<00:06:50.930> accounting<00:06:51.440> data

path to the target share on this

00:06:58.780 --> 00:07:00.210 
path to the target share on this
computer<00:06:58.990> i<00:06:59.169> set<00:06:59.349> up<00:06:59.410> another<00:06:59.560> shared<00:06:59.889> folder

00:07:00.210 --> 00:07:00.220 
computer i set up another shared folder

00:07:00.220 --> 00:07:03.410 
computer i set up another shared folder
on<00:07:00.340> the<00:07:00.430> c<00:07:00.580> drive<00:07:00.699> called<00:07:01.030> accounting<00:07:01.449> data

on the c drive called accounting data

00:07:03.420 --> 00:07:04.400 
on the c drive called accounting data
counting<00:07:03.630> data<00:07:03.810> I<00:07:03.900> set<00:07:04.140> up<00:07:04.230> a<00:07:04.290> couple

00:07:04.400 --> 00:07:04.410 
counting data I set up a couple

00:07:04.410 --> 00:07:07.839 
counting data I set up a couple
subfolders<00:07:05.160> quickbook<00:07:05.730> files<00:07:06.000> for<00:07:06.270> example

subfolders quickbook files for example

00:07:07.849 --> 00:07:09.929 
subfolders quickbook files for example
so<00:07:08.509> the<00:07:08.629> folder<00:07:09.050> name<00:07:09.080> is<00:07:09.319> accounting<00:07:09.709> data

00:07:09.929 --> 00:07:09.939 
so the folder name is accounting data

00:07:09.939 --> 00:07:15.959 
so the folder name is accounting data
the<00:07:10.939> share<00:07:11.209> name<00:07:11.449> is<00:07:11.599> acct<00:07:12.319> data

00:07:15.959 --> 00:07:15.969

so<00:07:58.120> again<00:07:58.300> the<00:07:58.389> thing<00:07:58.569> to<00:07:58.660> notice<00:07:58.840> is<00:07:59.110> with<00:07:59.440> DFS

00:08:00.200 --> 00:08:00.210 
so again the thing to notice is with DFS

00:08:00.210 --> 00:08:02.400 
so again the thing to notice is with DFS
everything<00:08:01.210> appears<00:08:01.599> to<00:08:01.660> be<00:08:01.780> in<00:08:01.870> one<00:08:02.110> spot

00:08:02.400 --> 00:08:02.410 
everything appears to be in one spot

00:08:02.410 --> 00:08:05.070 
everything appears to be in one spot

00:08:05.070 --> 00:08:05.080 
when in fact the targets the target

00:08:05.080 --> 00:08:06.330 
when in fact the targets the target
information<00:08:05.349> can<00:08:05.800> actually<00:08:06.039> come<00:08:06.159> from

00:08:06.330 --> 00:08:06.340 
information can actually come from

00:08:06.340 --> 00:08:07.710 
information can actually come from
different<00:08:06.490> spots<00:08:06.849> on<00:08:07.000> the<00:08:07.060> network<00:08:07.270> different
