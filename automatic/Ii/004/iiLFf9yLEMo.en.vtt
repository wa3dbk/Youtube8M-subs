00:00:14.650 --> 00:00:19.580
 had and welcome to my 

00:00:17.390 --> 00:00:21.919
 second back to school video and indeed 

00:00:19.580 --> 00:00:23.960
 I have a kind of back to work for today 

00:00:21.919 --> 00:00:27.020
 So school guide thinks with make-up 

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:29.689
 and outfit and hairstyle and snack and what 

00:00:27.020 --> 00:00:32.000
 Oh well, a drink that's just fine 

00:00:29.689 --> 00:00:32.900
 suitable to take away and so and 

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:36.830
 Of course not only for school 

00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:39.620
 but also for the uni or in the 

00:00:36.830 --> 00:00:40.610
 vacation in the future but for many starts yes 

00:00:39.620 --> 00:00:43.220
 Soon the school 

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:44.960
 stupidly, many are also straight 

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:46.039
 only the beginning of the holiday but the topic had 

00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:46.579
 we somehow at the next 

00:00:46.039 --> 00:00:48.739
 to meet 

00:00:46.579 --> 00:00:52.480
 I'm talking too much again 

00:00:48.739 --> 00:00:52.480
 I'm happy about the video 

00:00:58.510 --> 00:01:02.109
 So let's start with one 

00:01:00.339 --> 00:01:03.850
 snack to her super school in the 

00:01:02.109 --> 00:01:06.400
 and I have these 

00:01:03.850 --> 00:01:08.680
 can see everything everywhere on youtube 

00:01:06.400 --> 00:01:10.450
 but i have the feeling you will 

00:01:08.680 --> 00:01:11.619
 Often prepared that way 

00:01:10.450 --> 00:01:13.149
 not really enough 

00:01:11.619 --> 00:01:14.860
 that's why I have that a bit now 

00:01:13.149 --> 00:01:17.140
 done differently so i have below 

00:01:14.860 --> 00:01:18.190
 relatively much institute couscous purely 

00:01:17.140 --> 00:01:20.740
 and then made a little 

00:01:18.190 --> 00:01:22.720
 hot water instant brÃ¼hl all around 

00:01:20.740 --> 00:01:24.610
 mixed and then came all the vegetables 

00:01:22.720 --> 00:01:26.500
 that I have today on top of it 

00:01:24.610 --> 00:01:28.659
 and what you do not do of course 

00:01:26.500 --> 00:01:30.610
 It is essential to forget a fork 

00:01:28.659 --> 00:01:32.229
 joke themes I believe that namely 

00:01:30.610 --> 00:01:34.240
 something again with this dish 

00:01:32.229 --> 00:01:37.890
 could forget and I have mine 

00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:37.890
 now simply glass dressed differently 

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:41.700
 and I still have those times with it 

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:44.550
 Nobody hurt from the fork 

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:47.150
 kitchen towel wrapped over it and then was 

00:01:44.550 --> 00:01:49.430
 you already finished a salad but 

00:01:47.150 --> 00:01:51.690
 then , of course, still missing the pressing 

00:01:49.430 --> 00:01:53.400
 I just have that in one 

00:01:51.690 --> 00:01:55.050
 separate container reingetan with the 

00:01:53.400 --> 00:01:57.210
 salad during the day not to paper 

00:01:55.050 --> 00:01:59.900
 and then I just take it that way 

00:01:57.210 --> 00:01:59.900
 along with 

00:02:00.110 --> 00:02:04.380
 next there is a super delicious 

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:06.630
 drink, and I just have coffee 

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:08.310
 mixed with milk one to one and then 

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:10.050
 you need some syrup of yours here 

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:12.060
 choice and that best this very thick 

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:13.640
 for singh and you do it on top 

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:16.590
 the mix and it just tastes good 

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:18.630
 original as a drink is very 

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:20.370
 much cheaper and you can stop it 

00:02:18.630 --> 00:02:21.120
 just like you would like to get away 

00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:22.860
 prepare 

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:24.480
 and if you can and then you can 

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:26.489
 drink, of course, just in one 

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:29.670
 turbo which I take unfortunately 

00:02:26.489 --> 00:02:32.330
 only one word left but the course 

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:32.330
 of course, too 

00:02:33.350 --> 00:02:36.890
 Ok, then we continue with the make-up 

00:02:35.270 --> 00:02:39.440
 and as you know i want me 

00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:40.910
 personally like totally natural and 

00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:42.920
 Here are some new products I have 

00:02:40.910 --> 00:02:45.080
 at the moment I like to use it once 

00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:47.420
 this baby premium from valea that is total 

00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:48.560
 cheap and i like being like this 

00:02:47.420 --> 00:02:50.240
 I have to say if you have one more 

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:51.560
 be a bit brighter than me then as 

00:02:50.240 --> 00:02:54.370
 deep is probably a bit too 

00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:54.370
 be dark for you 

00:02:55.390 --> 00:02:58.840
 under the eyes, I then wear one more 

00:02:56.890 --> 00:03:01.630
 bit concealer on and tender is that 

00:02:58.840 --> 00:03:05.800
 one of those ever so that's one 

00:03:01.630 --> 00:03:07.150
 then I have concealer and city pula 

00:03:05.800 --> 00:03:09.340
 using a browser that works, of course 

00:03:07.150 --> 00:03:11.319
 only then with the browser not very much 

00:03:09.340 --> 00:03:14.020
 darker than a natural normal 

00:03:11.319 --> 00:03:15.610
 skin without but I am actually in the 

00:03:14.020 --> 00:03:17.080
 summer and then nothing more 

00:03:15.610 --> 00:03:19.630
 remembered that I actually still 

00:03:17.080 --> 00:03:22.120
 will want to use the care and then 

00:03:19.630 --> 00:03:24.370
 yes, I'm still going fast and 

00:03:22.120 --> 00:03:26.170
 then it was already on my eyes 

00:03:24.370 --> 00:03:27.630
 Today I have two hits shadow colors out 

00:03:26.170 --> 00:03:29.230
 a palette of essens 

00:03:27.630 --> 00:03:32.230
 mixed together this is like that 

00:03:29.230 --> 00:03:34.030
 karnickel means mine and that is 

00:03:32.230 --> 00:03:35.950
 great for natural everyday flights 

00:03:34.030 --> 00:03:36.730
 I think because the colors are relative 

00:03:35.950 --> 00:03:37.750
 see neutral 

00:03:36.730 --> 00:03:40.570
 I just like a middle one 

00:03:37.750 --> 00:03:42.030
 taken and then over my entire way 

00:03:40.570 --> 00:03:44.560
 distributed 

00:03:42.030 --> 00:03:47.500
 and before I applied for mascara 

00:03:44.560 --> 00:03:49.450
 I have in this ebeling pack 

00:03:47.500 --> 00:03:51.100
 my eyelashes still put it in shape 

00:03:49.450 --> 00:03:52.239
 By the way, it worked very well 

00:03:51.100 --> 00:03:54.190
 I have you here in my last one 

00:03:52.239 --> 00:03:56.260
 dm today can recommend the right 

00:03:54.190 --> 00:03:58.630
 and then mascara came over it that is 

00:03:56.260 --> 00:04:00.880
 dino deems maskawa also of essens and 

00:03:58.630 --> 00:04:04.600
 I really like them because of me 

00:04:00.880 --> 00:04:05.980
 It has a nice effect on the lips 

00:04:04.600 --> 00:04:08.590
 came then with a choir all the colors of the 

00:04:05.980 --> 00:04:10.150
 Glos von Kathrin and the make was ready 

00:04:08.590 --> 00:04:12.910
 up and this is really super fast 

00:04:10.150 --> 00:04:15.130
 in the morning if you do not have that much time 

00:04:12.910 --> 00:04:17.470
 has and then left with the hair 

00:04:15.130 --> 00:04:19.180
 I my hair moment I lied wear 

00:04:17.470 --> 00:04:21.070
 and I will not let them go first 

00:04:19.180 --> 00:04:22.870
 So a bit balm in the hair 

00:04:21.070 --> 00:04:25.140
 That's a product of that 

00:04:22.870 --> 00:04:27.669
 Grizzlys also from my last dm hall 

00:04:25.140 --> 00:04:29.979
 and that's how I define it 

00:04:27.669 --> 00:04:35.190
 a little bit so that they shape something more 

00:04:29.979 --> 00:04:35.190
 get out so and a little less power 

00:04:35.440 --> 00:04:40.640
 and then I have a pretty deep 

00:04:38.390 --> 00:04:42.200
 Pulled aside and I hate it 

00:04:40.640 --> 00:04:43.880
 yes, if the hair is one all the time 

00:04:42.200 --> 00:04:45.770
 but I like it 

00:04:43.880 --> 00:04:47.540
 actually open hairstyles totally like 

00:04:45.770 --> 00:04:49.760
 and I think that's very nice and that's it 

00:04:47.540 --> 00:04:52.010
 now a hairstyle that practically full 

00:04:49.760 --> 00:04:54.590
 the club you have to just that 

00:04:52.010 --> 00:04:56.990
 hair first part a bit 

00:04:54.590 --> 00:04:58.880
 superimposed in two parts 

00:04:56.990 --> 00:05:01.610
 divide then always put on top of each other 

00:04:58.880 --> 00:05:03.530
 and then this pattern and that stands 

00:05:01.610 --> 00:05:04.870
 you can then easily find on 

00:05:03.530 --> 00:05:10.930
 occiput 

00:05:04.870 --> 00:05:10.930
 usually stuck anyway 

00:05:12.280 --> 00:05:15.370
 and I should have elmar then too 

00:05:13.900 --> 00:05:16.870
 on the other side made so 

00:05:15.370 --> 00:05:22.200
 Just play two and then 

00:05:16.870 --> 00:05:22.200
 superimpose and at the end 

00:05:26.280 --> 00:05:29.400
 so the hair does not fly into you 

00:05:27.750 --> 00:05:32.480
 face but you still can 

00:05:29.400 --> 00:05:32.480
 apply halfway 

00:05:34.840 --> 00:05:37.240
 They have 

00:05:35.800 --> 00:05:39.460
 and then I have a little one 

00:05:37.240 --> 00:05:41.080
 outfit suggestion for you and all those 

00:05:39.460 --> 00:05:42.460
 I really like to ask things at the moment 

00:05:41.080 --> 00:05:44.349
 I have a pot here 

00:05:42.460 --> 00:05:46.030
 that's a very simple white that 

00:05:44.349 --> 00:05:47.530
 pretty short so you can see that 

00:05:46.030 --> 00:05:50.409
 a little bit of construction but me personally 

00:05:47.530 --> 00:05:51.460
 think that's not so bad so hope 

00:05:50.409 --> 00:05:53.199
 Let's have a look at the comments 

00:05:51.460 --> 00:05:55.870
 her belly asked or not 

00:05:53.199 --> 00:05:57.400
 I'm interested in this and that cinema thing 

00:05:55.870 --> 00:05:58.840
 I have that I have recently 

00:05:57.400 --> 00:06:00.460
 at mango it already bought a few 

00:05:58.840 --> 00:06:02.289
 weeks ago but I do not know 

00:06:00.460 --> 00:06:04.120
 Maybe you still find that and 

00:06:02.289 --> 00:06:05.500
 if I give it always and everywhere 

00:06:04.120 --> 00:06:08.580
 I have a light jeans 

00:06:05.500 --> 00:06:11.379
 combined and that was my outfit 

00:06:08.580 --> 00:06:12.940
 and of it a video like today I hope 

00:06:11.379 --> 00:06:15.280
 you liked it and you can 

00:06:12.940 --> 00:06:16.599
 In any case, another real 

00:06:15.280 --> 00:06:18.190
 video happy 

00:06:16.599 --> 00:06:21.030
 It will probably be next week 

00:06:18.190 --> 00:06:23.229
 come and that up to say so 

00:06:21.030 --> 00:06:25.030
 Of course it follows her video yes 

00:06:23.229 --> 00:06:26.650
 happy to give a thumbs up and you 

00:06:25.030 --> 00:06:28.509
 I can ask as a video question in the 

00:06:26.650 --> 00:06:30.460
 Write comments where you are this year 

00:06:28.509 --> 00:06:32.139
 go on vacation if you are somewhere 

00:06:30.460 --> 00:06:34.810
 in drive or private if you already 

00:06:32.139 --> 00:06:35.979
 Go somewhere since then and then read 

00:06:34.810 --> 00:06:37.300
 I like it very much here 

00:06:35.979 --> 00:06:38.860
 you can find it again at the 

00:06:37.300 --> 00:06:40.060
 linked last two videos and there 

00:06:38.860 --> 00:06:42.880
 we can then again 

00:06:40.060 --> 00:06:44.560
 see and I have to say went is still 

00:06:42.880 --> 00:06:46.150
 the holidays if you are still liable 

00:06:44.560 --> 00:06:49.110
 and just has a beautiful day 

00:06:46.150 --> 00:06:49.110
 makes it good
