 parked is already quite 

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:35.180
 weak however still causing the 

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:36.619
 polar air mass that drove him something 

00:01:35.180 --> 00:01:38.540
 of instability in terms of 

00:01:36.619 --> 00:01:41.360
 very cold temperatures with the morning by

00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:53.090
 appreciate in some light in some 

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:54.560

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:57.440

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:06.950
