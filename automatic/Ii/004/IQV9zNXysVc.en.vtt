modified<00:01:04.110> sheet<00:01:04.470> from<00:01:04.619> your<00:01:04.680> Excel<00:01:05.100> program

00:01:05.299 --> 00:01:05.309 
modified sheet from your Excel program

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:08.510 
modified sheet from your Excel program
into<00:01:05.880> your<00:01:05.909> VA's<00:01:06.659> Astin<00:01:07.200> so<00:01:07.380> you<00:01:07.439> can<00:01:07.710> pull<00:01:08.310> the

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:08.520 
into your VA's Astin so you can pull the

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:11.539 
into your VA's Astin so you can pull the
the<00:01:08.850> map<00:01:09.060> out<00:01:09.390> of<00:01:09.450> the<00:01:09.780> software<00:01:10.490> modify<00:01:11.490> it

00:01:11.539 --> 00:01:11.549 
the map out of the software modify it

00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:13.520 
the map out of the software modify it
evaluate<00:01:12.240> it<00:01:12.270> do<00:01:12.510> whatever<00:01:12.720> you<00:01:12.990> choose<00:01:13.260> and

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:13.530 
evaluate it do whatever you choose and

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:15.800 
evaluate it do whatever you choose and
then<00:01:13.920> import<00:01:14.490> it<00:01:14.580> back<00:01:14.729> in<00:01:14.939> if<00:01:15.060> you<00:01:15.479> would<00:01:15.659> like

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:15.810 
then import it back in if you would like

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:17.270 
then import it back in if you would like
so<00:01:16.290> that's<00:01:16.470> a<00:01:16.590> new<00:01:16.710> feature<00:01:16.740> with<00:01:17.189> the

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:17.280 
so that's a new feature with the

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:19.370 
so that's a new feature with the
software<00:01:17.670> that's<00:01:17.850> very<00:01:18.119> useful<00:01:18.360> right<00:01:19.170> now

00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:19.380 
software that's very useful right now

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:22.640 
software that's very useful right now
you<00:01:20.220> can<00:01:20.369> see<00:01:20.580> that<00:01:20.759> we're<00:01:21.030> actively<00:01:21.290> in<00:01:22.290> the

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:22.650 
you can see that we're actively in the

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:25.929 
you can see that we're actively in the
software<00:01:23.009> we're<00:01:23.520> hooked<00:01:23.820> up<00:01:23.970> to<00:01:24.150> our<00:01:24.240> bike<00:01:24.479> ok

00:01:25.929 --> 00:01:25.939 
software we're hooked up to our bike ok

00:01:25.939 --> 00:01:28.760 
software we're hooked up to our bike ok
yes<00:01:26.939> I<00:01:27.330> turned<00:01:27.659> the<00:01:27.990> key<00:01:28.170> on<00:01:28.200> on<00:01:28.439> the<00:01:28.560> bike

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:28.770 
yes I turned the key on on the bike

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:30.980 
yes I turned the key on on the bike
that'll<00:01:29.460> allow<00:01:29.640> the<00:01:29.700> full<00:01:30.060> system<00:01:30.299> circuit

00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:30.990 
that'll allow the full system circuit

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:33.679 
that'll allow the full system circuit
and<00:01:31.200> I<00:01:31.619> can<00:01:31.799> then<00:01:32.040> make<00:01:32.759> adjustments<00:01:33.360> to<00:01:33.390> my

00:01:33.679 --> 00:01:33.689 
and I can then make adjustments to my

00:01:33.689 --> 00:01:36.859 
and I can then make adjustments to my
map<00:01:33.930> and<00:01:34.140> traction<00:01:34.530> control<00:01:34.680> switch<00:01:35.570> now<00:01:36.570> our

00:01:36.859 --> 00:01:36.869 
map and traction control switch now our

map and traction control switch now our
map<00:01:37.110> selects<00:01:37.500> which<00:01:37.710> is<00:01:37.920> a<00:01:38.009> toggle<00:01:38.340> switch<00:01:38.520> if

00:01:39.469 --> 00:01:39.479 
map selects which is a toggle switch if

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:41.030 
map selects which is a toggle switch if
you<00:01:39.689> look<00:01:39.869> in<00:01:39.960> the<00:01:40.079> lower<00:01:40.259> left-hand<00:01:40.590> corner

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:41.040 
you look in the lower left-hand corner

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:42.740 
you look in the lower left-hand corner
of<00:01:41.220> the<00:01:41.520> screen<00:01:41.670> right<00:01:41.939> here<00:01:42.420> where<00:01:42.630> it<00:01:42.720> says

effectively<00:01:50.159> our<00:01:50.369> system<00:01:50.759> stores<00:01:51.030> 2<00:01:51.329> maps<00:01:51.630> and

00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:52.020 
effectively our system stores 2 maps and

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:54.980 
effectively our system stores 2 maps and
typically<00:01:53.180> when<00:01:54.180> you<00:01:54.270> think<00:01:54.450> of<00:01:54.570> Maps<00:01:54.780> you're

00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:54.990 
typically when you think of Maps you're

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:56.870 
typically when you think of Maps you're
thinking<00:01:55.259> of<00:01:55.350> fuel<00:01:55.590> maps<00:01:55.860> but<00:01:56.340> our<00:01:56.460> system<00:01:56.850> you

00:01:56.870 --> 00:01:56.880 
thinking of fuel maps but our system you

00:01:56.880 --> 00:01:58.639 
thinking of fuel maps but our system you
can<00:01:57.090> have<00:01:57.240> two<00:01:57.479> fuel<00:01:57.810> maps<00:01:58.049> which<00:01:58.409> you'll<00:01:58.619> see

00:01:58.639 --> 00:01:58.649 
can have two fuel maps which you'll see

00:01:58.649 --> 00:02:03.350 
can have two fuel maps which you'll see
here<00:01:59.210> the<00:02:00.210> values<00:02:00.600> are<00:02:00.750> changing<00:02:01.969> the<00:02:02.969> map<00:02:03.210> and

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:03.360 
here the values are changing the map and

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:05.690 
here the values are changing the map and
map<00:02:03.509> 2<00:02:03.750> is<00:02:03.960> our<00:02:04.140> slip-on<00:02:04.799> map<00:02:04.979> that<00:02:05.159> we<00:02:05.280> provide

with<00:02:05.939> the<00:02:06.030> kit<00:02:06.270> and<00:02:06.450> map<00:02:07.079> 1<00:02:07.409> it's<00:02:07.710> the<00:02:07.799> slip-on

00:02:08.210 --> 00:02:08.220 
with the kit and map 1 it's the slip-on

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:10.249 
with the kit and map 1 it's the slip-on
map<00:02:08.459> that<00:02:09.000> we've<00:02:09.179> just<00:02:09.450> went<00:02:09.660> in<00:02:09.780> and<00:02:09.989> applied

00:02:10.249 --> 00:02:10.259 
map that we've just went in and applied

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:11.900 
map that we've just went in and applied
adjustments<00:02:10.860> so<00:02:10.979> what<00:02:11.160> I'll<00:02:11.250> call<00:02:11.459> this<00:02:11.670> is

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:11.910 
adjustments so what I'll call this is

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:13.660 
adjustments so what I'll call this is
848<00:02:12.780> slip

00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:13.670 
848 slip

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:23.770 
848 slip
on<00:02:13.730> map<00:02:14.170> with<00:02:15.819> adjustments<00:02:21.610> okay<00:02:22.610> so<00:02:23.569> now<00:02:23.750> I

00:02:23.770 --> 00:02:23.780 
on map with adjustments okay so now I

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:25.270 
on map with adjustments okay so now I
know<00:02:24.050> that<00:02:24.260> that's<00:02:24.590> the<00:02:24.770> map<00:02:24.920> we've<00:02:25.099> made

00:02:25.270 --> 00:02:25.280 
know that that's the map we've made

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:27.729 
know that that's the map we've made
adjustments<00:02:25.400> to<00:02:25.970> you<00:02:26.750> can<00:02:26.900> also<00:02:27.050> store<00:02:27.440> two

00:02:27.729 --> 00:02:27.739 
adjustments to you can also store two

00:02:27.739 --> 00:02:29.800 
adjustments to you can also store two
different<00:02:28.040> quick<00:02:28.190> shift<00:02:28.400> kill<00:02:28.640> times<00:02:28.910> so<00:02:29.599> if<00:02:29.690> I

00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:29.810 
different quick shift kill times so if I

00:02:29.810 --> 00:02:31.809 
different quick shift kill times so if I
change<00:02:30.080> the<00:02:30.260> quick<00:02:30.470> shift<00:02:30.680> kill<00:02:30.920> time<00:02:31.190> for

00:02:31.809 --> 00:02:31.819 
change the quick shift kill time for

00:02:31.819 --> 00:02:34.600 
change the quick shift kill time for
first<00:02:32.330> to<00:02:32.600> second<00:02:33.140> in<00:02:33.290> one<00:02:33.950> particular<00:02:34.250> gear

first to second in one particular gear

00:02:34.610 --> 00:02:36.309 
first to second in one particular gear
maybe<00:02:34.790> we're<00:02:35.000> drag<00:02:35.300> racing<00:02:35.660> we<00:02:35.870> want<00:02:36.020> to<00:02:36.080> try<00:02:36.290> a

00:02:36.309 --> 00:02:36.319 
maybe we're drag racing we want to try a

00:02:36.319 --> 00:02:38.350 
maybe we're drag racing we want to try a
little<00:02:36.470> something<00:02:36.800> different<00:02:37.310> here<00:02:37.489> I'll<00:02:38.120> put

00:02:38.350 --> 00:02:38.360 
little something different here I'll put

00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:41.350 
little something different here I'll put
a<00:02:38.830> 40<00:02:39.830> there<00:02:40.010> just<00:02:40.340> hypothetically<00:02:41.120> and

00:02:41.350 --> 00:02:41.360 
a 40 there just hypothetically and

00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:43.270 
a 40 there just hypothetically and
you'll<00:02:42.050> notice<00:02:42.290> when<00:02:42.560> I<00:02:42.620> changed<00:02:43.010> a<00:02:43.099> map

00:02:43.270 --> 00:02:43.280 
you'll notice when I changed a map

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:45.940 
you'll notice when I changed a map
selects<00:02:43.640> which<00:02:43.849> map<00:02:44.599> won<00:02:44.989> the<00:02:45.319> kill<00:02:45.530> time<00:02:45.769> from

00:02:45.940 --> 00:02:45.950 
selects which map won the kill time from

selects which map won the kill time from
first<00:02:46.190> to<00:02:46.430> second<00:02:46.760> gear<00:02:46.880> is<00:02:46.910> 40<00:02:47.360> and<00:02:47.540> map<00:02:48.230> to

00:02:48.430 --> 00:02:48.440 
first to second gear is 40 and map to

00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:51.670 
first to second gear is 40 and map to
it's<00:02:48.650> 70<00:02:49.130> so<00:02:49.730> these<00:02:49.880> maps<00:02:50.180> are<00:02:50.569> not<00:02:51.140> just<00:02:51.410> fuel

00:02:51.670 --> 00:02:51.680 
it's 70 so these maps are not just fuel

00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:54.190 
it's 70 so these maps are not just fuel
system<00:02:52.040> related<00:02:52.569> they<00:02:53.569> can<00:02:53.750> be<00:02:53.870> applied<00:02:53.959> to

00:02:54.190 --> 00:02:54.200 
system related they can be applied to

00:02:54.200 --> 00:02:57.430 
system related they can be applied to
fuel<00:02:55.160> map<00:02:55.400> quick<00:02:56.239> shift<00:02:56.540> maps<00:02:56.900> and<00:02:57.200> also

00:02:57.430 --> 00:02:57.440 
fuel map quick shift maps and also

00:02:57.440 --> 00:02:59.740 
fuel map quick shift maps and also
traction<00:02:58.130> control<00:02:58.519> okay<00:02:59.030> similar<00:02:59.510> to<00:02:59.630> that

00:02:59.740 --> 00:02:59.750 
traction control okay similar to that

00:02:59.750 --> 00:03:01.660 
traction control okay similar to that
I've<00:03:00.230> got<00:03:00.440> two<00:03:00.680> different<00:03:00.769> traction<00:03:01.340> control

00:03:01.660 --> 00:03:01.670 
I've got two different traction control

00:03:01.670 --> 00:03:03.340 
I've got two different traction control
maps<00:03:01.880> in<00:03:02.120> here<00:03:02.330> and<00:03:02.480> you<00:03:02.690> can<00:03:02.840> notice<00:03:03.110> that<00:03:03.200> the

00:03:03.340 --> 00:03:03.350 
maps in here and you can notice that the

00:03:03.350 --> 00:03:06.070 
maps in here and you can notice that the
values<00:03:03.830> in<00:03:04.040> the<00:03:04.459> map<00:03:04.670> are<00:03:04.880> changing<00:03:05.360> when<00:03:05.930> I'm

00:03:06.070 --> 00:03:06.080 
values in the map are changing when I'm

00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:08.350 
values in the map are changing when I'm
adjusting<00:03:06.440> the<00:03:07.010> toggle<00:03:07.400> switch<00:03:07.610> so<00:03:08.150> now<00:03:08.299> that

00:03:08.350 --> 00:03:08.360 
adjusting the toggle switch so now that

00:03:08.360 --> 00:03:09.880 
adjusting the toggle switch so now that
you<00:03:08.630> see<00:03:08.870> that<00:03:09.200> we<00:03:09.319> have<00:03:09.500> two<00:03:09.709> different

00:03:09.880 --> 00:03:09.890 
you see that we have two different

00:03:09.890 --> 00:03:12.220 
you see that we have two different
traction<00:03:10.549> control<00:03:10.880> maps<00:03:11.120> set<00:03:11.450> from<00:03:11.720> Apple<00:03:12.049> one

00:03:12.220 --> 00:03:12.230 
traction control maps set from Apple one

00:03:12.230 --> 00:03:15.789 
traction control maps set from Apple one
to<00:03:12.860> map<00:03:13.040> to<00:03:13.360> let's<00:03:14.360> look<00:03:14.540> at<00:03:14.630> the<00:03:14.750> TC<00:03:15.110> trim

00:03:15.789 --> 00:03:15.799 
to map to let's look at the TC trim

00:03:15.799 --> 00:03:18.490 
to map to let's look at the TC trim
switch<00:03:16.069> okay<00:03:16.580> right<00:03:17.390> now<00:03:17.569> we<00:03:17.630> have<00:03:17.930> all<00:03:18.200> fives

00:03:18.490 --> 00:03:18.500 
switch okay right now we have all fives

00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:21.430 
switch okay right now we have all fives
in<00:03:18.709> our<00:03:18.829> base<00:03:19.040> map<00:03:19.280> and<00:03:19.519> map<00:03:19.670> two<00:03:19.970> and<00:03:20.299> the<00:03:21.200> gear

00:03:21.430 --> 00:03:21.440 
in our base map and map two and the gear

00:03:21.440 --> 00:03:23.710 
in our base map and map two and the gear
positions<00:03:21.920> are<00:03:22.100> non<00:03:22.310> set<00:03:22.760> so<00:03:23.060> effectively

00:03:23.710 --> 00:03:23.720 
positions are non set so effectively

00:03:23.720 --> 00:03:26.259 
positions are non set so effectively
we've<00:03:23.930> got<00:03:24.140> a<00:03:24.380> TC<00:03:24.950> sensitivity<00:03:25.609> level<00:03:25.910> of<00:03:26.000> five

00:03:26.259 --> 00:03:26.269 
we've got a TC sensitivity level of five

00:03:26.269 --> 00:03:28.930 
we've got a TC sensitivity level of five
globally<00:03:27.140> across<00:03:27.440> the<00:03:27.650> board<00:03:27.890> if<00:03:28.459> I<00:03:28.670> want<00:03:28.850> to

00:03:28.930 --> 00:03:28.940 
globally across the board if I want to

00:03:28.940 --> 00:03:31.420 
globally across the board if I want to
turn<00:03:29.120> those<00:03:29.299> sensitivity<00:03:30.019> values<00:03:30.440> up<00:03:30.980> and

00:03:31.420 --> 00:03:31.430 
turn those sensitivity values up and

00:03:31.430 --> 00:03:33.819 
turn those sensitivity values up and
give<00:03:31.609> myself<00:03:31.820> a<00:03:32.180> more<00:03:32.450> sensitive<00:03:32.900> traction

00:03:33.819 --> 00:03:33.829 
give myself a more sensitive traction

00:03:33.829 --> 00:03:35.800 
give myself a more sensitive traction
control<00:03:34.100> setting<00:03:34.489> where<00:03:34.880> to<00:03:34.970> come<00:03:35.180> on<00:03:35.359> sooner

00:03:35.800 --> 00:03:35.810 
control setting where to come on sooner

00:03:35.810 --> 00:03:37.900 
control setting where to come on sooner
out<00:03:35.989> on<00:03:36.140> the<00:03:36.230> racetrack<00:03:36.440> I<00:03:36.950> can<00:03:37.549> trim<00:03:37.790> the

00:03:37.900 --> 00:03:37.910 
out on the racetrack I can trim the

00:03:37.910 --> 00:03:40.420 
out on the racetrack I can trim the
switch<00:03:38.150> up<00:03:38.390> by<00:03:38.859> three<00:03:39.859> percent

00:03:40.420 --> 00:03:40.430 
switch up by three percent

00:03:40.430 --> 00:03:44.349 
switch up by three percent
so<00:03:40.640> we'll<00:03:40.790> go<00:03:40.940> +3<00:03:41.540> one<00:03:41.950> two<00:03:43.000> three<00:03:44.000> on<00:03:44.030> the

00:03:44.349 --> 00:03:44.359 
so we'll go +3 one two three on the

00:03:44.359 --> 00:03:46.539 
so we'll go +3 one two three on the
switch<00:03:44.600> and<00:03:44.930> that's<00:03:45.350> displayed<00:03:45.980> under<00:03:46.280> trim

00:03:46.539 --> 00:03:46.549 
switch and that's displayed under trim

00:03:46.549 --> 00:03:48.520 
switch and that's displayed under trim
switch<00:03:46.850> in<00:03:47.090> the<00:03:47.450> upper<00:03:47.750> right<00:03:47.930> hand<00:03:47.959> corner<00:03:48.350> of

the<00:03:48.620> TC<00:03:49.040> page<00:03:49.310> okay<00:03:50.090> so<00:03:50.299> now<00:03:50.900> effectively<00:03:51.620> my

00:03:52.390 --> 00:03:52.400 
the TC page okay so now effectively my

third<00:04:05.600> gear<00:04:05.989> I<00:04:06.200> want<00:04:06.829> to<00:04:06.920> turn<00:04:07.100> the

00:04:07.270 --> 00:04:07.280 
third gear I want to turn the

00:04:07.280 --> 00:04:11.470 
third gear I want to turn the
sensitivity<00:04:07.519> down<00:04:08.299> in<00:04:08.600> third<00:04:08.840> gear<00:04:10.359> so<00:04:11.359> I'll

00:04:11.470 --> 00:04:11.480 
sensitivity down in third gear so I'll

00:04:11.480 --> 00:04:13.809 
sensitivity down in third gear so I'll
click<00:04:11.900> on<00:04:11.959> my<00:04:12.109> arrow<00:04:12.500> and<00:04:13.280> I'll<00:04:13.430> turn<00:04:13.670> it<00:04:13.790> down

00:04:13.809 --> 00:04:13.819 
click on my arrow and I'll turn it down

00:04:13.819 --> 00:04:19.330 
click on my arrow and I'll turn it down
by<00:04:14.690> 5<00:04:15.109> percent<00:04:15.650> okay<00:04:16.400> so<00:04:17.380> with<00:04:18.380> a<00:04:18.410> base<00:04:18.950> setting

00:04:19.330 --> 00:04:19.340 
by 5 percent okay so with a base setting

00:04:19.340 --> 00:04:23.380 
by 5 percent okay so with a base setting
of<00:04:19.639> 5<00:04:20.000> in<00:04:20.359> the<00:04:20.750> sensitivity<00:04:21.470> map<00:04:22.010> in<00:04:22.280> 3rd<00:04:23.060> gear

00:04:23.380 --> 00:04:23.390 
of 5 in the sensitivity map in 3rd gear

00:04:23.390 --> 00:04:26.469 
of 5 in the sensitivity map in 3rd gear
when<00:04:23.659> we're<00:04:23.780> riding<00:04:23.930> our<00:04:24.110> bike<00:04:24.320> in<00:04:24.560> 3rd<00:04:24.800> gear<00:04:25.479> 5

00:04:26.469 --> 00:04:26.479 
when we're riding our bike in 3rd gear 5

00:04:26.479 --> 00:04:27.310 
when we're riding our bike in 3rd gear 5
and

00:04:27.310 --> 00:04:27.320 
and

00:04:27.320 --> 00:04:28.900 
and
negative<00:04:27.560> five<00:04:27.770> balance<00:04:28.490> each<00:04:28.640> other<00:04:28.790> out

00:04:28.900 --> 00:04:28.910 
negative five balance each other out

00:04:28.910 --> 00:04:31.450 
negative five balance each other out
which<00:04:29.300> gives<00:04:29.480> us<00:04:29.690> a<00:04:29.870> zero<00:04:30.140> value<00:04:30.380> but<00:04:30.920> our<00:04:31.010> trim

00:04:31.450 --> 00:04:31.460 
which gives us a zero value but our trim

00:04:31.460 --> 00:04:33.610 
which gives us a zero value but our trim
switch<00:04:31.760> is<00:04:31.940> gonna<00:04:32.120> be<00:04:32.270> out<00:04:32.360> of<00:04:32.390> three<00:04:32.840> so

00:04:33.610 --> 00:04:33.620 
switch is gonna be out of three so

00:04:33.620 --> 00:04:35.470 
switch is gonna be out of three so
effectively<00:04:34.100> the<00:04:34.310> rest<00:04:34.550> of<00:04:34.670> the<00:04:34.760> map<00:04:34.940> and<00:04:35.150> all

00:04:35.470 --> 00:04:35.480 
effectively the rest of the map and all

00:04:35.480 --> 00:04:37.720 
effectively the rest of the map and all
other<00:04:35.720> gears<00:04:36.110> will<00:04:36.500> have<00:04:36.680> a<00:04:36.710> setting<00:04:37.160> of<00:04:37.280> eight

00:04:37.720 --> 00:04:37.730 
other gears will have a setting of eight

00:04:37.730 --> 00:04:40.270 
other gears will have a setting of eight
but<00:04:38.450> in<00:04:38.600> third<00:04:38.930> gear<00:04:39.230> will<00:04:39.440> be<00:04:39.590> at<00:04:39.770> a<00:04:39.800> setting

00:04:40.270 --> 00:04:40.280 
but in third gear will be at a setting

00:04:40.280 --> 00:04:44.680 
but in third gear will be at a setting
of<00:04:40.430> three<00:04:40.910> okay<00:04:41.810> and<00:04:42.130> also<00:04:43.130> many<00:04:43.550> times<00:04:43.820> for

00:04:44.680 --> 00:04:44.690 
of three okay and also many times for

00:04:44.690 --> 00:04:47.470 
of three okay and also many times for
road<00:04:44.900> racing<00:04:45.290> applications<00:04:46.180> many<00:04:47.180> riders

00:04:47.470 --> 00:04:47.480 
road racing applications many riders

00:04:47.480 --> 00:04:49.840 
road racing applications many riders
would<00:04:47.780> prefer<00:04:48.140> for<00:04:48.200> the<00:04:48.470> starting<00:04:48.950> line<00:04:49.460> to

00:04:49.840 --> 00:04:49.850 
would prefer for the starting line to

00:04:49.850 --> 00:04:51.400 
would prefer for the starting line to
turn<00:04:50.060> traction<00:04:50.540> control<00:04:50.780> completely<00:04:51.230> off<00:04:51.380> and

00:04:51.400 --> 00:04:51.410 
turn traction control completely off and

00:04:51.410 --> 00:04:53.170 
turn traction control completely off and
first<00:04:51.830> gear<00:04:52.100> to<00:04:52.190> get<00:04:52.340> a<00:04:52.370> great<00:04:52.580> start<00:04:52.880> and

00:04:53.170 --> 00:04:53.180 
first gear to get a great start and

00:04:53.180 --> 00:04:54.490 
first gear to get a great start and
that's<00:04:53.390> what<00:04:53.540> makes<00:04:53.750> this<00:04:53.840> feature<00:04:54.110> really

00:04:54.490 --> 00:04:54.500 
that's what makes this feature really

00:04:54.500 --> 00:04:56.380 
that's what makes this feature really
useful<00:04:54.950> so<00:04:55.430> you<00:04:55.460> can<00:04:55.670> turn<00:04:55.790> it<00:04:55.940> off<00:04:56.030> in<00:04:56.210> first

00:04:56.380 --> 00:04:56.390 
useful so you can turn it off in first

00:04:56.390 --> 00:04:59.770 
useful so you can turn it off in first
gear<00:04:56.780> in<00:04:56.960> map<00:04:57.860> 2<00:04:58.130> when<00:04:58.940> you<00:04:59.060> hit<00:04:59.240> the<00:04:59.360> infield

00:04:59.770 --> 00:04:59.780 
gear in map 2 when you hit the infield

00:04:59.780 --> 00:05:01.420 
gear in map 2 when you hit the infield
and<00:05:00.080> you're<00:05:00.470> no<00:05:00.590> longer<00:05:00.620> worried<00:05:01.130> about<00:05:01.190> the

00:05:01.420 --> 00:05:01.430 
and you're no longer worried about the

00:05:01.430 --> 00:05:02.950 
and you're no longer worried about the
starting<00:05:01.730> line<00:05:01.940> you<00:05:02.090> can<00:05:02.240> switch<00:05:02.450> over<00:05:02.750> back

00:05:02.950 --> 00:05:02.960 
starting line you can switch over back

00:05:02.960 --> 00:05:05.470 
starting line you can switch over back
in<00:05:02.990> the<00:05:03.200> map<00:05:03.380> 1<00:05:03.710> or<00:05:03.920> vice<00:05:04.280> versa<00:05:04.460> and<00:05:04.940> have<00:05:05.450> a
