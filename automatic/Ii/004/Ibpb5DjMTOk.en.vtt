 catarina 16 stores great expectation 

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:12.420
 about her new fiesta without a doubt 

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:14.130
 no party besides being already a success 

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:16.770
 in its first in its first version 

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:19.409
 who arrived there two years ago in Brazil is 

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:22.049
 goes through a restyling use is 

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:23.700
 quite significant because it is a 

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:24.840
 car then it needs to be 

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:28.439
 aligned in all its markets 

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:30.720
 underwent restyling to for all 

00:01:28.439 --> 00:01:31.920
 world then the Brazilian picks up there we go 

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:33.479
 say so 

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:35.040
 right now that it changes in the 

00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:36.869
 europe changes in the united states mandam 

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:38.310
 in other countries of the world continents 

00:01:36.869 --> 00:01:40.380
 here pro brasil too 

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:42.270
 but now it is now being manufactured 

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:44.640
 here is our great asset to 

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:45.420
 2013 until local production of new party 

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:47.549
 on here 

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:49.710
 5 is being marketed there 

00:01:47.549 --> 00:01:52.500
 out then we gain in technology 

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:54.600
 we mainly win in scale is 

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:56.909
 the car lowers the price the car has more 

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:58.829
 possibility of finishing 

00:01:56.909 --> 00:02:00.890
 model versions 

00:01:58.829 --> 00:02:03.659
 now it comes with two engine options 

00:02:00.890 --> 00:02:06.600
 two-engine revolutionary sigma engine 

00:02:03.659 --> 00:02:08.520
 1.6 that already equipped the focus lines 

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:11.670
 ecosport other vehicles produced here 

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:13.830
 now recalibrated in this 

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:15.600
 national version of the new party 

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:18.240
 of the 130 horsepower aluminum engine 

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:21.000
 really a fantastic performance and 

00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:22.950
 great new 1.5 engine to fight 

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:25.350
 there by price a segment extremely 

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:28.680
 competitive as one of premium hatch 

00:02:25.350 --> 00:02:30.360
 compact that we have in Brazil is and 

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:32.340
 new party he fights let's say so 

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:34.890
 in the low category due to the price 

00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:36.960
 but it delivers much that no one 

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:38.970
 car segment delivery as is the case 

00:02:36.960 --> 00:02:41.070
 the new model of the new cash 

00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:43.170
 shift powershift that was the export 

00:02:41.070 --> 00:02:45.390
 was the launch of the sport three 

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:47.040
 months ago and now equip version 

00:02:45.390 --> 00:02:48.720
 new party national 

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:51.030
 then the first compact produced in 

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:53.160
 Brazil is like a six-speed gearbox 

00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:54.959
 and double clutch so it really is 

00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:57.300
 a lot of technology forms an infinity 

00:02:54.959 --> 00:02:58.470
 resources where to close the car and 

00:02:57.300 --> 00:03:00.270
 a design that really is very 

00:02:58.470 --> 00:03:00.930
 beautiful is a great promise of 

00:03:00.270 --> 00:03:02.640
 ford 

00:03:00.930 --> 00:03:03.959
 the official launch in June but the 

00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:05.970
 People are already seeing the car arriving at 

00:03:03.959 --> 00:03:08.970
 stores and I walked with the car more than 100 

00:03:05.970 --> 00:03:12.630
 km of iguazu's life and I really 

00:03:08.970 --> 00:03:15.150
 there was no type of depreciation for 

00:03:12.630 --> 00:03:16.650
 be manufactured in Brazil the formula 1 had 

00:03:15.150 --> 00:03:18.300
 some criticism from the press and a 

00:03:16.650 --> 00:03:20.280
 Internal finishing has been nothing wrong. 

00:03:18.300 --> 00:03:22.019
 this is internal because it has not been 

00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:23.970
 also changed the internal architecture 

00:03:22.019 --> 00:03:25.980
 because it's very beautiful, right? 

00:03:23.970 --> 00:03:28.590
 the panel of the new fiesta of the new fiesta already 

00:03:25.980 --> 00:03:30.540
 missing medical campaign panel was 

00:03:28.590 --> 00:03:35.060
 dynamic futurist was all kept 

00:03:30.540 --> 00:03:35.060
 only to change the finish that was more 

00:03:35.330 --> 00:03:40.650
 drunk on the new face now is a 

00:03:37.440 --> 00:03:43.140
 more rigid plastic but with the face 

00:03:40.650 --> 00:03:45.420
 extended finish looks very beautiful 

00:03:43.140 --> 00:03:47.459
 not fully rigid is also not 

00:03:45.420 --> 00:03:48.930
 was the only difference that 

00:03:47.459 --> 00:03:50.310
 I do not have only that I noticed one 

00:03:48.930 --> 00:03:52.860
 difference for the better 

00:03:50.310 --> 00:03:54.930
 to be produced in Brazil it Adriano 

00:03:52.860 --> 00:03:56.550
 is more suited to suspensions than 

00:03:54.930 --> 00:03:59.580
 Actual conditions in Brazil evidently 

00:03:56.550 --> 00:04:03.239
 outside agenda saw what unites the party 

00:03:59.580 --> 00:04:06.120
 Mexican has suffered here and has adapted so 

00:04:03.239 --> 00:04:07.620
 has a little more resources pensions 

00:04:06.120 --> 00:04:09.209
 the card a little more risk to 

00:04:07.620 --> 00:04:11.970
 platform is the same as the five 

00:04:09.209 --> 00:04:14.070
 global platforms, and so the 

00:04:11.970 --> 00:04:16.229
 great merit I think we think you 

00:04:14.070 --> 00:04:18.150
 agree with me, the new fiesta is a car 

00:04:16.229 --> 00:04:19.859
 very solid in its structure and very 

00:04:18.150 --> 00:04:20.880
 agile also mainly transit 

00:04:19.859 --> 00:04:24.090
 urban right 

00:04:20.880 --> 00:04:26.100
 no doubt I may be our spectator 

00:04:24.090 --> 00:04:27.270
 do not know but the vehicles are 

00:04:26.100 --> 00:04:28.830
 tested and 

00:04:27.270 --> 00:04:30.509
 exhaustively prior to launch on the 

00:04:28.830 --> 00:04:31.889
 case of the new fiesta were 2 million 

00:04:30.509 --> 00:04:34.289
 then we will test the assemblers already 

00:04:31.889 --> 00:04:36.270
 they think ahead of time in the 

00:04:34.289 --> 00:04:37.919
 vehicle will suffer over time and 

00:04:36.270 --> 00:04:40.080
 how will he behave after a 

00:04:37.919 --> 00:04:42.419
 certain mileage then the question of 

00:04:40.080 --> 00:04:44.129
 noise is of accommodation of the parts 

00:04:42.419 --> 00:04:47.220
 mainly plastic parts 

00:04:44.129 --> 00:04:49.139
 this all sometimes defines one here 

00:04:47.220 --> 00:04:51.419
 apparently it may have a finish 

00:04:49.139 --> 00:04:53.520
 inferior or not in reality it is 

00:04:51.419 --> 00:04:55.349
 looking into the future how this 

00:04:53.520 --> 00:04:56.669
 car will behave after suffering 

00:04:55.349 --> 00:04:58.889
 with our roads the precariousness 

00:04:56.669 --> 00:05:00.690
 of our streets will not even have to leave 

00:04:58.889 --> 00:05:03.240
 inside porto alegre for example to 

00:05:00.690 --> 00:05:04.889
 feel it is much irregularity that 

00:05:03.240 --> 00:05:05.639
 reflected in the front in the ordinary cars are 

00:05:04.889 --> 00:05:07.319
 used 

00:05:05.639 --> 00:05:09.690
 let us also remember that the price of 

00:05:07.319 --> 00:05:12.270
 beginning at the super high res 

00:05:09.690 --> 00:05:14.849
 answer in 2009 193 environment 

00:05:12.270 --> 00:05:16.620
 competitive and who now seek from 

00:05:14.849 --> 00:05:19.110
 this week you will find 

00:05:16.620 --> 00:05:22.229
 this price starting from frame he leaves 

00:05:19.110 --> 00:05:25.680
 of 38,990 in its initial version are three 

00:05:22.229 --> 00:05:27.389
 versions if titanium this initial version 

00:05:25.680 --> 00:05:29.849
 is already very complete if you already have 

00:05:27.389 --> 00:05:33.090
 airbag dual abs brakes electric steering 

00:05:29.849 --> 00:05:34.889
 system of glass locks and finally a 

00:05:33.090 --> 00:05:36.270
 series of things the customer has to 

00:05:34.889 --> 00:05:38.190
 to go there to check the car is 

00:05:36.270 --> 00:05:39.900
 arriving is very beautiful and it's coming 

00:05:38.190 --> 00:05:41.550
 in quantity is higher than what 

00:05:39.900 --> 00:05:43.860
 resellers that have greater availability 

00:05:41.550 --> 00:05:45.900
 of stock outside the southern region of Brazil 

00:05:43.860 --> 00:05:47.310
 then the virtual edition then 

00:05:45.900 --> 00:05:49.259
 car and motorcycle notebook the mail 

00:05:47.310 --> 00:05:50.969
