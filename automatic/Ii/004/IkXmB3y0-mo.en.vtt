we're gonna mounting that on our

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:54.139 
we're gonna mounting that on our
velocity<00:00:52.350> stack<00:00:52.620> these<00:00:53.070> are<00:00:53.280> both<00:00:53.430> from<00:00:53.579> TG<00:00:54.000> n

00:00:54.139 --> 00:00:54.149 
velocity stack these are both from TG n

velocity stack these are both from TG n
this<00:00:54.570> guy's<00:00:54.840> team<00:00:55.230> chase<00:00:55.530> part<00:00:55.860> and<00:00:56.280> we<00:00:56.399> have

00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:56.430 
this guy's team chase part and we have

this guy's team chase part and we have
an<00:00:56.579> outer<00:00:56.730> wear<00:00:56.969> pre<00:00:57.390> stage<00:00:57.690> filter<00:00:58.140> for<00:00:58.739> our

00:00:58.849 --> 00:00:58.859 
an outer wear pre stage filter for our

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:01.069 
an outer wear pre stage filter for our
already<00:00:59.520> triple<00:00:59.969> filter<00:01:00.270> so<00:01:00.510> we're<00:01:00.840> gonna<00:01:00.960> be

00:01:01.069 --> 00:01:01.079 
already triple filter so we're gonna be

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:02.180 
already triple filter so we're gonna be
pretty<00:01:01.230> well<00:01:01.410> set<00:01:01.440> in<00:01:01.739> terms<00:01:01.829> of<00:01:02.039> air

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:02.190 
pretty well set in terms of air

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:04.310 
pretty well set in terms of air
filtering<00:01:02.640> definitely<00:01:03.270> and<00:01:03.570> velocity<00:01:04.080> stack

00:01:04.310 --> 00:01:04.320 
filtering definitely and velocity stack

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:05.450 
filtering definitely and velocity stack
should<00:01:04.500> help<00:01:04.710> air<00:01:04.890> flow<00:01:05.070> a<00:01:05.129> little<00:01:05.250> bit

00:01:05.450 --> 00:01:05.460 
should help air flow a little bit

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:07.010 
should help air flow a little bit
hopefully<00:01:06.060> we<00:01:06.119> can<00:01:06.240> tune<00:01:06.420> it<00:01:06.540> up<00:01:06.630> a<00:01:06.720> little<00:01:06.810> bit

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:07.020 
hopefully we can tune it up a little bit

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:08.780

now<00:03:00.630> before<00:03:00.930> we<00:03:00.959> bolt<00:03:01.170> the<00:03:01.290> sign<00:03:01.500> you<00:03:01.650> want<00:03:01.800> to

00:03:01.850 --> 00:03:01.860 
now before we bolt the sign you want to

00:03:01.860 --> 00:03:04.610 
now before we bolt the sign you want to
check<00:03:02.010> the<00:03:02.190> fitment<00:03:02.780> line<00:03:03.780> up<00:03:03.990> the<00:03:04.110> bolt<00:03:04.350> holes

00:03:04.610 --> 00:03:04.620 
check the fitment line up the bolt holes

00:03:04.620 --> 00:03:07.040 
check the fitment line up the bolt holes
best<00:03:04.950> you<00:03:05.100> can<00:03:05.370> and<00:03:06.060> take<00:03:06.270> a<00:03:06.300> look<00:03:06.540> down<00:03:06.750> in<00:03:06.959> the

best you can and take a look down in the

00:03:07.050 --> 00:03:08.420 
best you can and take a look down in the
stack<00:03:07.290> and<00:03:07.530> make<00:03:07.650> sure<00:03:07.770> that<00:03:07.860> you<00:03:08.010> don't<00:03:08.220> have

00:03:08.420 --> 00:03:08.430 
stack and make sure that you don't have

00:03:08.430 --> 00:03:11.210

00:03:14.540 --> 00:03:14.550 
diameter of the carb if you have some

00:03:14.550 --> 00:03:16.430 
diameter of the carb if you have some
overlap<00:03:14.970> in<00:03:15.000> or<00:03:15.420> lip<00:03:15.720> there<00:03:15.930> you<00:03:16.140> might<00:03:16.290> want

00:03:16.430 --> 00:03:16.440 
overlap in or lip there you might want

00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:18.259 
overlap in or lip there you might want
to<00:03:16.500> take<00:03:16.680> a<00:03:16.709> dremel<00:03:16.980> and<00:03:17.340> just<00:03:17.820> clean<00:03:18.060> it<00:03:18.090> up

00:03:18.259 --> 00:03:18.269 
to take a dremel and just clean it up

00:03:18.269 --> 00:03:19.880 
to take a dremel and just clean it up
sand<00:03:18.630> it<00:03:18.780> smooth<00:03:19.019> the<00:03:19.170> whole<00:03:19.260> point<00:03:19.500> of<00:03:19.590> stack

00:03:19.880 --> 00:03:19.890 
sand it smooth the whole point of stack

00:03:19.890 --> 00:03:21.199 
sand it smooth the whole point of stack
is<00:03:20.070> to<00:03:20.220> kind<00:03:20.400> of<00:03:20.459> smooth<00:03:20.730> the<00:03:20.850> airflow<00:03:21.150> going

00:03:21.199 --> 00:03:21.209 
is to kind of smooth the airflow going

00:03:21.209 --> 00:03:23.509 
is to kind of smooth the airflow going
in<00:03:21.720> so<00:03:22.260> if<00:03:22.350> you<00:03:22.440> have<00:03:22.560> overlapping<00:03:23.010> I'll<00:03:23.310> kind

00:03:23.509 --> 00:03:23.519 
in so if you have overlapping I'll kind

00:03:23.519 --> 00:03:25.190 
in so if you have overlapping I'll kind
of<00:03:23.640> give<00:03:24.150> you<00:03:24.239> an<00:03:24.330> idea<00:03:24.360> what<00:03:24.720> overlap<00:03:25.050> would

00:03:25.190 --> 00:03:25.200 
of give you an idea what overlap would

00:03:25.200 --> 00:03:26.690 
of give you an idea what overlap would
look<00:03:25.350> like<00:03:25.500> something<00:03:25.709> like<00:03:25.890> that<00:03:26.250> that's<00:03:26.580> an

00:03:26.690 --> 00:03:26.700 
look like something like that that's an

00:03:26.700 --> 00:03:28.460 
look like something like that that's an
extreme<00:03:27.060> case<00:03:27.269> you're<00:03:27.870> gonna<00:03:27.989> have<00:03:28.170> to<00:03:28.260> clean

00:03:28.460 --> 00:03:28.470 
extreme case you're gonna have to clean

00:03:28.470 --> 00:03:29.810 
extreme case you're gonna have to clean
it<00:03:28.590> up<00:03:28.709> or<00:03:28.890> get<00:03:29.100> a<00:03:29.130> different<00:03:29.459> stack<00:03:29.640> all

00:03:29.810 --> 00:03:29.820 
it up or get a different stack all

00:03:29.820 --> 00:03:31.430 
it up or get a different stack all
together<00:03:29.940> if<00:03:30.600> you're<00:03:30.780> running<00:03:30.930> a<00:03:31.110> car<00:03:31.260> with<00:03:31.410> a

00:03:31.430 --> 00:03:31.440 
together if you're running a car with a

00:03:31.440 --> 00:03:33.380 
together if you're running a car with a
choke<00:03:31.769> like<00:03:32.400> we<00:03:32.550> are<00:03:32.700> here<00:03:33.000> you<00:03:33.120> want<00:03:33.300> to<00:03:33.330> make

00:03:33.380 --> 00:03:33.390 
choke like we are here you want to make

00:03:33.390 --> 00:03:34.850 
choke like we are here you want to make
sure<00:03:33.600> that<00:03:33.720> the<00:03:33.840> choke<00:03:34.050> plate<00:03:34.200> does<00:03:34.650> not

00:03:34.850 --> 00:03:34.860 
sure that the choke plate does not

00:03:34.860 --> 00:03:36.440 
sure that the choke plate does not
interfere<00:03:35.130> with<00:03:35.400> the<00:03:35.610> stack<00:03:35.850> it<00:03:36.030> doesn't<00:03:36.300> bind

00:03:36.440 --> 00:03:36.450 
interfere with the stack it doesn't bind

00:03:36.450 --> 00:03:38.180 
interfere with the stack it doesn't bind
on<00:03:36.660> it<00:03:36.810> so<00:03:37.290> again<00:03:37.410> I'm<00:03:37.620> gonna<00:03:37.709> line<00:03:37.980> up<00:03:38.070> the

00:03:38.180 --> 00:03:38.190 
on it so again I'm gonna line up the

00:03:38.190 --> 00:03:39.560 
on it so again I'm gonna line up the
holes<00:03:38.400> so<00:03:38.550> you<00:03:38.670> could<00:03:38.790> put<00:03:38.910> the<00:03:39.000> bolts<00:03:39.269> in<00:03:39.390> -

00:03:39.560 --> 00:03:39.570 
holes so you could put the bolts in -

00:03:39.570 --> 00:03:41.060 
holes so you could put the bolts in -
are<00:03:39.690> you<00:03:39.780> doing<00:03:39.870> this<00:03:40.080> just<00:03:40.320> operate<00:03:40.980> the

00:03:41.060 --> 00:03:41.070 
are you doing this just operate the

00:03:41.070 --> 00:03:42.979 
are you doing this just operate the
choke<00:03:41.280> and<00:03:41.430> make<00:03:41.519> sure<00:03:41.640> that<00:03:41.730> it<00:03:41.850> clears<00:03:42.150> mine

00:03:42.979 --> 00:03:42.989 
choke and make sure that it clears mine

00:03:42.989 --> 00:03:44.810 
choke and make sure that it clears mine
does<00:03:43.200> so<00:03:43.350> I<00:03:43.410> have<00:03:43.500> no<00:03:43.590> problem<00:03:44.010> I<00:03:44.160> got<00:03:44.370> my<00:03:44.489> Oren

00:03:44.810 --> 00:03:44.820 
does so I have no problem I got my Oren

00:03:44.820 --> 00:03:46.910 
does so I have no problem I got my Oren
installed<00:03:45.180> mating<00:03:45.600> surface<00:03:45.870> is<00:03:45.989> clean<00:03:46.260> so<00:03:46.890> I

00:03:46.910 --> 00:03:46.920 
installed mating surface is clean so I

00:03:46.920 --> 00:03:48.770 
installed mating surface is clean so I
can<00:03:47.070> put<00:03:47.190> this<00:03:47.310> guy<00:03:47.550> on<00:03:47.580> we<00:03:48.269> can<00:03:48.420> install<00:03:48.630> the

00:03:48.770 --> 00:03:48.780 
can put this guy on we can install the

00:03:48.780 --> 00:03:50.840 
can put this guy on we can install the

tight<00:04:16.739> I<00:04:16.890> replaced<00:04:17.250> the<00:04:17.370> paper<00:04:17.609> filter<00:04:17.970> in

00:04:18.020 --> 00:04:18.030 
tight I replaced the paper filter in

00:04:18.030 --> 00:04:19.490 
tight I replaced the paper filter in
back<00:04:18.239> and<00:04:18.450> I<00:04:18.540> have<00:04:18.630> an<00:04:18.750> o-ring<00:04:18.900> filter<00:04:19.410> in

00:04:32.210 --> 00:04:32.220 
band clamp on you already for you so

00:04:32.220 --> 00:04:33.440 
band clamp on you already for you so
really<00:04:32.370> all<00:04:32.580> that's<00:04:32.760> left<00:04:32.970> you<00:04:33.090> just<00:04:33.120> pop<00:04:33.420> it

00:04:36.170 --> 00:04:36.180 
on like so and tighten down the band

00:04:36.180 --> 00:04:40.040 
on like so and tighten down the band
clamp<00:04:38.120> all<00:04:39.120> right<00:04:39.240> I<00:04:39.300> got<00:04:39.450> my<00:04:39.480> band<00:04:39.780> clamp

00:04:40.040 --> 00:04:40.050 
clamp all right I got my band clamp

00:04:40.050 --> 00:04:41.720 
clamp all right I got my band clamp
tightened<00:04:40.440> down<00:04:40.500> and<00:04:40.890> that<00:04:41.250> really<00:04:41.460> does<00:04:41.610> it

00:04:41.720 --> 00:04:41.730 
tightened down and that really does it

00:04:41.730 --> 00:04:43.220 
tightened down and that really does it
for<00:04:41.850> the<00:04:41.940> install<00:04:41.970> the<00:04:42.420> three-stage<00:04:42.840> filter

00:04:43.220 --> 00:04:43.230 
for the install the three-stage filter

00:04:43.230 --> 00:04:45.710 
for the install the three-stage filter
so<00:04:43.470> again<00:04:43.740> I<00:04:43.920> got<00:04:44.160> this<00:04:44.550> is<00:04:44.640> a<00:04:44.670> tgn<00:04:45.210> three-stage

00:04:45.710 --> 00:04:45.720 
so again I got this is a tgn three-stage

00:04:45.720 --> 00:04:48.080 
so again I got this is a tgn three-stage
don't<00:04:46.020> filter<00:04:46.380> it's<00:04:47.010> bolted<00:04:47.250> on<00:04:47.460> to<00:04:47.640> our<00:04:47.730> new<00:04:47.850> t

00:04:48.080 --> 00:04:48.090 
don't filter it's bolted on to our new t

00:04:48.090 --> 00:04:49.880 
don't filter it's bolted on to our new t
GN<00:04:48.360> velocity<00:04:48.990> stack<00:04:49.260> that's<00:04:49.560> gonna<00:04:49.680> help

00:04:49.880 --> 00:04:49.890 
GN velocity stack that's gonna help

00:04:49.890 --> 00:04:51.620 
GN velocity stack that's gonna help
increase<00:04:50.370> air<00:04:50.640> flow<00:04:50.670> as<00:04:50.940> well<00:04:51.120> as<00:04:51.180> allows<00:04:51.420> to

00:04:51.620 --> 00:04:51.630 
increase air flow as well as allows to

00:04:51.630 --> 00:04:53.420 
increase air flow as well as allows to
run<00:04:51.720> aftermarket<00:04:52.440> filters<00:04:52.740> like<00:04:52.950> this

00:04:53.420 --> 00:04:53.430 
run aftermarket filters like this

00:04:53.430 --> 00:04:55.370 
run aftermarket filters like this
and<00:04:53.760> I<00:04:53.790> have<00:04:53.940> my<00:04:54.090> team<00:04:54.360> chase<00:04:54.690> this<00:04:55.170> is<00:04:55.230> a

00:04:55.370 --> 00:04:55.380 
and I have my team chase this is a

00:04:55.380 --> 00:04:57.440 
and I have my team chase this is a

00:04:59.390 --> 00:04:59.400 
back of the carb again I only do these

00:04:59.400 --> 00:05:01.190 
back of the carb again I only do these
pieces<00:04:59.669> look<00:05:00.060> nice<00:05:00.330> but<00:05:00.870> they're<00:05:01.050> very
