00:00:03.100 --> 00:00:08.420
 is bookable if you laugh anyway Wera Swonarewa proved that today several times 

00:00:08.420 --> 00:00:12.240
 we somehow went on strike with material in the form of tension throughout the match 

00:00:19.369 --> 00:00:22.289
 The Russian had against last year's finalist Sam Stosur the 

00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:23.490
 better start 

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:26.490
 and secures 1 earned with 6 to 2 secured 

00:00:27.439 --> 00:00:30.439
 sees himself 

00:00:32.510 --> 00:00:36.090
 The Australian, however, kept cool and did not let herself through 

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:39.610
 Leather change you theater on the other side from the rest 

00:00:40.380 --> 00:00:43.380
 while Zvonareva increasingly desperate 

00:00:49.550 --> 00:00:52.550
 the sentence compensation as a logical consequence 

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:05.780
 In the end, the tiebreaker had to make the decision 

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:08.660
 Here, the current number seven in the world was in the lead 

00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:12.110
 and played the match that even if she was not everyday home 

00:01:21.220 --> 00:01:22.180
 Erekat 

00:01:22.180 --> 00:01:23.440
 Half one 

00:01:23.440 --> 00:01:26.700
 yes that he is really weird I can imagine how frustrating that would be 

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:30.550
 If the pages are in thrilling every few minutes and it is always and always 

00:01:30.550 --> 00:01:33.550
 he happened again wanted it is cool 

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:38.550
 In the purely German duel, the two had to catamaran percent of bees 

00:01:38.550 --> 00:01:41.660
 sit and Julia GÃ¶rges against the advertising make up 

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:47.259
 in the by the play area with typical power tennis was equipped 

00:01:47.259 --> 00:01:48.140
 quickly clear 

00:01:48.140 --> 00:01:51.140
 how that will look like 

00:01:56.400 --> 00:01:59.400
 that envy now but that their chances better to use 

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:09.280
 in the second round, too, the North German remained true to its route 

00:02:10.039 --> 00:02:13.709
 the opponents made that the man from Bremen and then beat 

00:02:18.179 --> 00:02:19.609
 the recipe for success 

00:02:19.609 --> 00:02:22.609
 and to the semi-finals 

00:02:32.679 --> 00:02:36.349
 almost all cases would like to go on tolerance but still trained torso 

00:02:36.349 --> 00:02:40.159
 optimize renovates so compact that it will be different Thomas end 

00:02:40.159 --> 00:02:41.189
 there 

00:02:41.189 --> 00:02:44.419
 In the end, everyone does their job "Everyone is exactly sunbathing 

00:02:44.419 --> 00:02:48.719
 getting the better sides were really an issue at about one percent as well 

00:02:48.719 --> 00:02:50.489
 it is rarely around 

00:02:50.489 --> 00:02:52.979
 There is always always aside 

00:02:52.979 --> 00:02:56.010
 who have been good for me one if not one 

00:02:56.010 --> 00:02:59.299
 in summoned together 

00:02:59.299 --> 00:03:02.249
 no lower than the world ranking first it was for 

00:03:02.249 --> 00:03:05.809
 Germany's top player Andrea Petkovic is pleased to bring the leader 

00:03:06.779 --> 00:03:09.779
 had the Darmstadt in the first two matches still start-up problems 

00:03:10.520 --> 00:03:13.520
 wanted a different pace with this 

00:03:15.599 --> 00:03:18.109
 Pine 1 against Caroline Wozniacki 

00:03:18.109 --> 00:03:20.919
 a nice cushion 

00:03:20.919 --> 00:03:24.279
 Wozniacki pointed that out, so she is number one 

00:03:24.919 --> 00:03:26.330
 She loves German running 

00:03:26.330 --> 00:03:29.330
 in which the forces dwindled more and more 

00:03:32.099 --> 00:03:35.369
 five games in a row for the Vienna and meant the set win 

00:03:43.479 --> 00:03:47.359
 and in the second round, Bautzen went on exactly where she had been before 

00:03:47.359 --> 00:03:48.679
 had stopped 

00:03:48.679 --> 00:03:50.459
 clever clay court tennis 

00:03:50.459 --> 00:03:53.769
 the weather is playing ten games losses in a row the tooth 

00:04:09.099 --> 00:04:11.709
 14 6 and one to put 

00:04:11.709 --> 00:04:13.549
 the chances given 

00:04:13.549 --> 00:04:16.549
 mourned afterwards 

00:04:18.799 --> 00:04:21.930
 colored balls in each game breakballs 

00:04:21.930 --> 00:04:25.240
 and somehow I did not get baked that that's what counts 

00:04:25.240 --> 00:04:27.360
 that you play you are at the players 

00:04:27.360 --> 00:04:29.930
 and be used in the texts 

00:04:29.930 --> 00:04:34.300
 As in 2001, Christina Bauer wanted her match against Agnieszka 

00:04:34.300 --> 00:04:36.259
 Radwanska use 

00:04:36.259 --> 00:04:38.610
 For a long time the Germans kept more than just 

00:04:38.610 --> 00:04:40.610
 and brought the world ranking-5 Center 

00:04:40.610 --> 00:04:43.610
 time after time to despair 

00:04:54.189 --> 00:04:56.300
 but for the big coup 

00:04:56.300 --> 00:04:59.300
 it should not be enough 

00:05:04.490 --> 00:05:07.490
 the double error at the set ball 

00:05:14.559 --> 00:05:17.120
 same game in the second round 

00:05:17.120 --> 00:05:18.889
 Breuer were ahead again 

00:05:18.889 --> 00:05:22.189
 and then had to see again the wheel armor their whole experience 

00:05:22.189 --> 00:05:25.189
 played out 

00:05:55.330 --> 00:05:58.750
 but Kristina Barrois deserves a lot of respect 

00:05:58.750 --> 00:05:59.779
 at her appearance 

00:05:59.779 --> 00:06:02.779
 at the porsche-tennis-grand-prix 

00:06:05.749 --> 00:06:09.119
 because there is no OCZ I knew from the outset that is not an easy one 

00:06:09.119 --> 00:06:12.089
 After three matches I would have seen that almost a match 

00:06:12.089 --> 00:06:15.239
 Half an hour was there I just said damn I must certainly 

00:06:15.239 --> 00:06:16.569
 stay here all night 

00:06:16.569 --> 00:06:20.169
 It would be really clear if we would either
