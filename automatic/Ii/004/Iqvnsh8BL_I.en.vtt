I noticed at night

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:16.220 
I noticed at night
I<00:00:15.059> can't<00:00:15.420> run<00:00:15.570> into<00:00:15.780> a<00:00:15.809> little<00:00:15.900> bit<00:00:16.109> of<00:00:16.170> an

00:00:16.220 --> 00:00:16.230 
I can't run into a little bit of an

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:19.519 
I can't run into a little bit of an
issue<00:00:16.490> whether<00:00:17.490> it<00:00:17.670> being<00:00:17.820> cutting<00:00:18.779> grass<00:00:19.020> or

little<00:00:23.250> tractors<00:00:23.580> have<00:00:23.730> a<00:00:23.760> great<00:00:24.000> little

00:00:24.259 --> 00:00:24.269 
little tractors have a great little

00:00:24.269 --> 00:00:26.480 
little tractors have a great little
front<00:00:25.260> loader<00:00:25.439> you<00:00:25.680> can<00:00:25.800> attachment<00:00:26.279> you<00:00:26.340> can

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:26.490 
front loader you can attachment you can

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:28.160 
front loader you can attachment you can
have<00:00:26.609> with<00:00:26.789> them<00:00:26.939> and<00:00:27.269> they<00:00:27.689> they<00:00:28.019> work

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:28.170 
have with them and they they work

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:30.109 
have with them and they they work
awesome<00:00:28.619> but<00:00:29.189> there's<00:00:29.369> one<00:00:29.550> little<00:00:29.670> design

00:00:30.109 --> 00:00:30.119 
awesome but there's one little design

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:32.299 
awesome but there's one little design
flaw<00:00:30.420> and<00:00:30.539> that<00:00:30.660> is<00:00:30.840> that<00:00:31.140> you<00:00:31.710> don't<00:00:31.920> have<00:00:32.099> the

00:00:32.299 --> 00:00:32.309 
flaw and that is that you don't have the

00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:34.970 
flaw and that is that you don't have the
ability<00:00:32.369> to<00:00:32.610> have<00:00:32.910> your<00:00:33.440> well<00:00:34.440> you<00:00:34.590> can't<00:00:34.829> have

00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:34.980 
ability to have your well you can't have

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:36.110 
ability to have your well you can't have
your<00:00:35.130> headlights<00:00:35.280> on<00:00:35.579> but<00:00:35.700> they<00:00:35.790> don't<00:00:35.969> work

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:36.120 
your headlights on but they don't work

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:40.850 
your headlights on but they don't work
too<00:00:36.329> well<00:00:36.480> when<00:00:36.750> your<00:00:38.239> your<00:00:39.239> buckets<00:00:39.660> down<00:00:39.860> so

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:40.860 
too well when your your buckets down so

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:44.270 
too well when your your buckets down so
I<00:00:41.750> kind<00:00:42.750> of<00:00:42.870> started<00:00:43.050> researching<00:00:43.680> and<00:00:44.040> seeing

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:44.280 
I kind of started researching and seeing

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:45.740 
I kind of started researching and seeing
what<00:00:44.430> the<00:00:44.550> other<00:00:44.579> people<00:00:45.059> were<00:00:45.120> doing<00:00:45.180> and<00:00:45.570> and

00:00:45.740 --> 00:00:45.750 
what the other people were doing and and

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:48.260 
what the other people were doing and and
some<00:00:46.739> people<00:00:46.770> are<00:00:47.070> adding<00:00:47.309> some<00:00:47.850> lights<00:00:48.059> to

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:48.270 
some people are adding some lights to

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:51.709 
some people are adding some lights to
the<00:00:48.360> the<00:00:48.750> top<00:00:48.989> ROPS<00:00:49.350> bar<00:00:49.710> the<00:00:49.950> RO<00:00:50.160> PS<00:00:51.030> rollover

00:00:51.709 --> 00:00:51.719 
the the top ROPS bar the RO PS rollover

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:52.430 
the the top ROPS bar the RO PS rollover
protection

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:52.440 
protection

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:55.639 
protection
so<00:00:53.280> basically<00:00:54.110> watched<00:00:55.110> a<00:00:55.230> few<00:00:55.379> YouTube

00:00:55.639 --> 00:00:55.649 
so basically watched a few YouTube

00:00:55.649 --> 00:00:58.220 
so basically watched a few YouTube
videos<00:00:56.180> myself<00:00:57.180> till<00:00:57.390> the<00:00:57.539> research<00:00:57.899> and<00:00:58.109> came

00:00:58.220 --> 00:00:58.230 
videos myself till the research and came

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:00.770 
videos myself till the research and came
up<00:00:58.350> with<00:00:58.469> a<00:00:58.500> little<00:00:58.710> idea<00:00:58.859> and<00:00:59.390> what<00:01:00.390> I<00:01:00.420> did<00:01:00.629> was

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:00.780 
up with a little idea and what I did was

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:03.139 
up with a little idea and what I did was
I<00:01:00.840> ended<00:01:00.960> up<00:01:01.079> adding<00:01:01.260> them<00:01:01.699> for<00:01:02.699> tractor

00:01:03.139 --> 00:01:03.149 
I ended up adding them for tractor

00:01:03.149 --> 00:01:06.710 
I ended up adding them for tractor
lights<00:01:03.359> to<00:01:04.229> the<00:01:04.489> mess<00:01:05.489> set<00:01:05.700> up<00:01:05.820> I'm<00:01:06.600> pretty

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:06.720 
lights to the mess set up I'm pretty

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:08.480 
lights to the mess set up I'm pretty
pleased<00:01:07.020> with<00:01:07.049> how<00:01:07.290> it<00:01:07.409> turned<00:01:07.439> out

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:08.490 
pleased with how it turned out

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:10.100 
pleased with how it turned out
overall<00:01:09.270> I<00:01:09.330> think<00:01:09.420> it<00:01:09.659> turned<00:01:09.960> out<00:01:10.049> pretty

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:10.110 
overall I think it turned out pretty

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:13.219 
overall I think it turned out pretty
clean<00:01:10.530> and<00:01:11.030> not<00:01:12.030> no<00:01:12.180> major<00:01:12.450> modification<00:01:13.110> to

00:01:13.219 --> 00:01:13.229 
clean and not no major modification to

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:15.550 
clean and not no major modification to
the<00:01:13.320> system<00:01:13.680> or<00:01:13.710> anything

00:01:15.550 --> 00:01:15.560 
the system or anything

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:18.859 
the system or anything
those<00:01:16.560> of<00:01:16.740> you<00:01:16.830> that<00:01:16.979> do<00:01:17.159> have<00:01:17.340> a<00:01:17.450> BX<00:01:18.450> model

00:01:18.859 --> 00:01:18.869 
those of you that do have a BX model

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:21.740 
those of you that do have a BX model
Kubota<00:01:19.140> as<00:01:19.439> a<00:01:19.770> rule<00:01:20.299> turns<00:01:21.299> out<00:01:21.479> there's

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:21.750 
Kubota as a rule turns out there's

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:23.780 
Kubota as a rule turns out there's
basically<00:01:22.229> and<00:01:22.950> I<00:01:23.040> wish<00:01:23.189> I<00:01:23.310> forgot<00:01:23.610> this

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:23.790 
basically and I wish I forgot this

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:30.560 
basically and I wish I forgot this
before<00:01:24.420> I<00:01:25.189> did<00:01:26.189> my<00:01:26.720> video<00:01:27.720> but<00:01:27.990> here<00:01:29.509> there's<00:01:30.509> a

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:30.570 
before I did my video but here there's a

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:33.109 
before I did my video but here there's a
there's<00:01:31.079> an<00:01:31.229> accessory<00:01:31.710> wire<00:01:32.159> in<00:01:32.490> here<00:01:32.759> that's

00:01:33.109 --> 00:01:33.119 
there's an accessory wire in here that's

00:01:33.119 --> 00:01:34.999 
there's an accessory wire in here that's
already<00:01:33.299> wired<00:01:33.600> in<00:01:33.780> for<00:01:33.960> 20<00:01:34.200> amp<00:01:34.380> from

00:01:34.999 --> 00:01:35.009 
already wired in for 20 amp from

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:36.590 
already wired in for 20 amp from
Cambodia<00:01:35.549> and<00:01:35.790> I'm<00:01:35.939> assuming<00:01:36.329> for<00:01:36.450> these

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:36.600 
Cambodia and I'm assuming for these

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:38.539 
Cambodia and I'm assuming for these
types<00:01:36.840> of<00:01:36.960> things<00:01:37.110> that<00:01:37.229> are<00:01:37.439> here<00:01:37.590> whether<00:01:38.400> it

00:01:38.539 --> 00:01:38.549 
types of things that are here whether it

00:01:38.549 --> 00:01:40.490 
types of things that are here whether it
relights<00:01:38.909> are<00:01:39.180> probably<00:01:39.509> a<00:01:39.540> hitch<00:01:39.930> attachment

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:40.500 
relights are probably a hitch attachment

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:42.770 
relights are probably a hitch attachment
or<00:01:40.560> such<00:01:40.770> so<00:01:41.700> I<00:01:41.729> I<00:01:42.060> was<00:01:42.360> able<00:01:42.450> to<00:01:42.570> basically

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:42.780 
or such so I I was able to basically

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:44.810 
or such so I I was able to basically
just<00:01:43.110> plug<00:01:43.320> straight<00:01:43.619> into<00:01:43.680> that<00:01:44.100> and<00:01:44.640> where

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:44.820 
just plug straight into that and where

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:48.530 
just plug straight into that and where
that<00:01:44.970> is<00:01:45.030> is<00:01:45.420> right<00:01:46.049> here<00:01:46.549> if<00:01:47.549> you<00:01:48.090> bought<00:01:48.420> it

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:48.540 
that is is right here if you bought it

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:50.359 
that is is right here if you bought it
your<00:01:48.659> tractor<00:01:49.020> new<00:01:49.170> or<00:01:49.290> anything<00:01:49.590> you'd<00:01:49.770> find

00:01:50.359 --> 00:01:50.369 
your tractor new or anything you'd find

00:01:50.369 --> 00:01:53.060 
your tractor new or anything you'd find
it<00:01:50.520> basically<00:01:50.880> taped<00:01:51.270> up<00:01:51.509> in<00:01:51.689> a<00:01:51.810> wiring<00:01:52.740> mess

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:53.070 
it basically taped up in a wiring mess

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:56.870 
it basically taped up in a wiring mess
so<00:01:53.479> just<00:01:54.479> grabbed<00:01:54.720> into<00:01:54.990> that<00:01:55.140> and<00:01:55.439> then<00:01:56.159> run

00:01:56.870 --> 00:01:56.880 
so just grabbed into that and then run

00:01:56.880 --> 00:02:01.090 
so just grabbed into that and then run
my<00:01:57.060> wire<00:01:57.619> up<00:01:58.619> here<00:01:59.149> alongside<00:02:00.149> the<00:02:00.630> original

00:02:01.090 --> 00:02:01.100 
my wire up here alongside the original

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:04.069 
my wire up here alongside the original

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:13.860 
reversed and forward these are 55

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:17.230

relatively cheap to buy any roll king
Northern<00:02:21.510> Tool<00:02:21.690> and<00:02:21.960> then<00:02:22.110> would<00:02:22.260> carry

00:02:22.490 --> 00:02:22.500 
Northern Tool and then would carry

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:25.100 
Northern Tool and then would carry
something<00:02:22.740> like<00:02:22.830> that<00:02:23.100> and<00:02:23.750> just<00:02:24.750> to<00:02:24.870> kind<00:02:25.020> of

00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:25.110 
something like that and just to kind of

00:02:32.270 --> 00:02:32.280 
the key which is kind of nice

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:44.210 
the key which is kind of nice
so<00:02:34.460> basically

00:02:44.210 --> 00:02:44.220 

00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:48.110

able<00:03:12.930> to<00:03:13.020> see<00:03:13.170> behind<00:03:13.320> it<00:03:13.650> or<00:03:13.770> whenever<00:03:13.950> I'm

00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:14.130 
able to see behind it or whenever I'm

00:03:14.130 --> 00:03:16.430 
able to see behind it or whenever I'm
picking<00:03:14.460> it<00:03:14.550> up<00:03:14.610> and<00:03:14.880> then<00:03:15.600> obviously<00:03:15.750> the

00:03:16.430 --> 00:03:16.440 
picking it up and then obviously the

00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:18.710 
picking it up and then obviously the
forward<00:03:16.770> lights<00:03:17.060> these<00:03:18.060> work<00:03:18.300> are<00:03:18.480> great

forward lights these work are great

00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:21.290 
forward lights these work are great
because<00:03:19.380> when<00:03:19.530> my<00:03:19.620> buckets<00:03:19.980> down<00:03:20.190> then<00:03:20.970> I<00:03:21.060> get

00:03:21.290 --> 00:03:21.300 
because when my buckets down then I get

00:03:21.300 --> 00:03:24.200 
because when my buckets down then I get
good<00:03:21.540> forward<00:03:22.260> light<00:03:22.530> with<00:03:23.190> these<00:03:23.370> and<00:03:23.820> then

00:03:24.200 --> 00:03:24.210 
good forward light with these and then

00:03:24.210 --> 00:03:26.000 
good forward light with these and then
when<00:03:24.300> the<00:03:24.390> buckets<00:03:24.750> up<00:03:24.960> if<00:03:25.320> I'm<00:03:25.560> ever<00:03:25.710> working

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:26.010 
when the buckets up if I'm ever working

00:03:26.010 --> 00:03:28.190 
when the buckets up if I'm ever working
then<00:03:26.310> obviously<00:03:26.460> the<00:03:26.940> the<00:03:27.420> regular<00:03:27.750> front

00:03:28.190 --> 00:03:28.200 
then obviously the the regular front

00:03:28.200 --> 00:03:30.770 
then obviously the the regular front
lights<00:03:28.440> work<00:03:28.860> well<00:03:29.130> so<00:03:29.430> it<00:03:29.970> gives<00:03:30.360> me<00:03:30.480> the<00:03:30.630> best
