00:00:03.789 --> 00:00:03.799 
for me there's there's four different

00:00:03.799 --> 00:00:07.249 
for me there's there's four different
types<00:00:04.799> of<00:00:05.100> picking<00:00:05.970> that<00:00:06.089> I<00:00:06.150> like<00:00:06.750> to<00:00:06.899> work<00:00:07.020> on

00:00:07.249 --> 00:00:07.259 
types of picking that I like to work on

00:00:07.259 --> 00:00:09.140 
types of picking that I like to work on
individually<00:00:07.950> there's<00:00:08.429> picking<00:00:08.790> one<00:00:08.970> note

00:00:09.140 --> 00:00:09.150 
individually there's picking one note

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:10.580 
individually there's picking one note
per<00:00:09.330> string<00:00:09.360> two<00:00:09.750> notes<00:00:09.960> per<00:00:10.019> strings

00:00:10.580 --> 00:00:10.590 
per string two notes per strings

per string two notes per strings
three<00:00:11.340> notes<00:00:11.519> per<00:00:11.700> string<00:00:11.730> and<00:00:12.000> four<00:00:12.389> what<00:00:13.049> I

00:00:13.070 --> 00:00:13.080 
three notes per string and four what I

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:16.250 
three notes per string and four what I
like<00:00:13.290> to<00:00:13.440> do<00:00:13.590> is<00:00:13.799> is<00:00:14.519> just<00:00:15.030> pick<00:00:15.960> through<00:00:16.170> our

like to do is is just pick through our
pezzi<00:00:16.529> O's<00:00:16.710> it<00:00:17.010> starts<00:00:17.609> out<00:00:17.730> with<00:00:17.789> two<00:00:17.850> notes

00:00:18.170 --> 00:00:18.180 
pezzi O's it starts out with two notes

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:20.689 
pezzi O's it starts out with two notes
per<00:00:18.390> string<00:00:18.420> but<00:00:19.400> essentially<00:00:20.400> you're<00:00:20.520> just

00:00:20.689 --> 00:00:20.699 
per string but essentially you're just

00:00:20.699 --> 00:00:25.220 
per string but essentially you're just
doing<00:00:20.970> you're<00:00:21.750> going<00:00:21.960> again<00:00:22.400> I<00:00:23.510> like<00:00:24.510> to<00:00:24.660> pick

00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:25.230 
doing you're going again I like to pick

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:49.580 
doing you're going again I like to pick
it<00:00:25.260> just<00:00:25.590> to<00:00:25.769> get<00:00:26.070> my<00:00:26.220> hand<00:00:26.519> moving<00:00:48.590> that's

00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:49.590 
it just to get my hand moving that's

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:52.700 
it just to get my hand moving that's
what<00:00:49.710> I<00:00:49.770> do<00:00:49.829> for<00:00:50.510> one<00:00:51.510> note<00:00:51.719> per<00:00:51.960> string<00:00:51.989> sort

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:52.710 
what I do for one note per string sort

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:55.220 
what I do for one note per string sort
of<00:00:52.800> just<00:00:53.010> to<00:00:53.190> work<00:00:53.699> that<00:00:53.940> out<00:00:53.969> for<00:00:54.390> for<00:00:55.110> two

00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:55.230 
of just to work that out for for two

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:57.709 
of just to work that out for for two
notes<00:00:55.410> per<00:00:55.500> string<00:00:55.649> you<00:00:56.430> can<00:00:56.579> use<00:00:57.030> any<00:00:57.270> pattern

00:00:57.709 --> 00:00:57.719 
notes per string you can use any pattern

00:00:57.719 --> 00:01:04.070 
notes per string you can use any pattern
right<00:00:58.649> now<00:00:58.680> I'll<00:00:58.920> do<00:00:59.070> just<00:01:00.059> a<00:01:00.410> penitent<00:01:03.080> but

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:04.080 
right now I'll do just a penitent but

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:06.170 
right now I'll do just a penitent but
what<00:01:04.350> I<00:01:04.379> like<00:01:04.589> to<00:01:04.710> do<00:01:04.890> when<00:01:05.640> I<00:01:05.700> get<00:01:05.760> to<00:01:05.880> twos

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:06.180 
what I like to do when I get to twos

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:09.469 
what I like to do when I get to twos
threes<00:01:07.070> is<00:01:08.070> this<00:01:08.729> do<00:01:08.909> string<00:01:09.210> skipping

00:01:09.469 --> 00:01:09.479 
threes is this do string skipping

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:11.330 
threes is this do string skipping
because<00:01:09.930> it<00:01:10.080> just<00:01:10.200> forces<00:01:10.470> you<00:01:10.680> to<00:01:10.799> have<00:01:10.920> that

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:11.340 
because it just forces you to have that

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:13.609 
because it just forces you to have that
much<00:01:11.549> more<00:01:11.729> control<00:01:12.240> and<00:01:12.510> to<00:01:12.960> actually<00:01:13.080> slow

00:01:13.609 --> 00:01:13.619 
much more control and to actually slow

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:21.000 
much more control and to actually slow
down<00:01:13.650> and<00:01:14.189> so<00:01:15.119> it'll<00:01:15.390> just<00:01:15.420> be

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:21.010 

00:01:21.010 --> 00:01:26.050 

and<00:01:22.810> one<00:01:23.810> of<00:01:23.840> the<00:01:23.990> key<00:01:24.170> things<00:01:24.440> is<00:01:24.740> is<00:01:25.280> starting

00:01:26.050 --> 00:01:26.060 
and one of the key things is is starting

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:28.020 
and one of the key things is is starting
with<00:01:26.360> a<00:01:26.390> downstroke<00:01:26.960> and<00:01:27.140> then<00:01:27.380> once<00:01:27.830> you

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:28.030 
with a downstroke and then once you

00:01:28.030 --> 00:01:30.430 
with a downstroke and then once you
exercise<00:01:29.030> it<00:01:29.150> a<00:01:29.210> few<00:01:29.420> times<00:01:29.660> to<00:01:29.870> a<00:01:30.050> metronome

00:01:30.430 --> 00:01:30.440 
exercise it a few times to a metronome

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:32.410 
exercise it a few times to a metronome
which<00:01:31.100> we'll<00:01:31.250> talk<00:01:31.400> about<00:01:31.460> in<00:01:31.670> a<00:01:31.790> second

00:01:32.410 --> 00:01:32.420 
which we'll talk about in a second

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:35.070 
which we'll talk about in a second
I<00:01:32.450> like<00:01:33.140> to<00:01:33.290> start<00:01:33.680> with<00:01:33.740> an<00:01:33.920> upstroke<00:01:34.400> because

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:35.080 
I like to start with an upstroke because

00:01:35.080 --> 00:01:37.420 
I like to start with an upstroke because
it's<00:01:36.080> a<00:01:36.170> bit<00:01:36.290> awkward<00:01:36.620> at<00:01:36.740> times<00:01:36.770> but<00:01:37.250> it's

00:01:37.420 --> 00:01:37.430 
it's a bit awkward at times but it's

00:01:37.430 --> 00:01:38.980 
it's a bit awkward at times but it's
good<00:01:37.700> for<00:01:37.940> when<00:01:38.240> you're<00:01:38.270> alternate<00:01:38.780> picking

00:01:38.980 --> 00:01:38.990 
good for when you're alternate picking

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:40.630 
good for when you're alternate picking
through<00:01:39.380> a<00:01:39.410> line<00:01:39.619> because<00:01:40.190> you<00:01:40.280> never<00:01:40.400> know

00:01:40.630 --> 00:01:40.640 
through a line because you never know

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:41.650 
through a line because you never know
when<00:01:40.820> you're<00:01:40.940> going<00:01:41.060> to<00:01:41.119> need<00:01:41.180> to<00:01:41.360> start<00:01:41.600> with

00:01:41.650 --> 00:01:41.660 
when you're going to need to start with

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:51.280 
when you're going to need to start with
an<00:01:41.810> upstroke<00:01:42.229> so<00:01:49.270> that<00:01:50.270> just<00:01:50.450> gets<00:01:50.630> the<00:01:50.720> the

00:01:51.280 --> 00:01:51.290 
an upstroke so that just gets the the

00:01:51.290 --> 00:01:52.630 
an upstroke so that just gets the the
two<00:01:51.470> notes<00:01:51.619> per<00:01:51.800> string<00:01:51.830> working<00:01:52.399> or<00:01:52.550> you

00:01:52.630 --> 00:01:52.640 
two notes per string working or you

00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:55.660 
two notes per string working or you
could<00:01:52.790> do<00:01:53.110> you<00:01:54.110> know<00:01:54.229> there's<00:01:54.920> a<00:01:55.009> seventh<00:01:55.580> or

00:01:55.660 --> 00:01:55.670 
could do you know there's a seventh or

00:01:55.670 --> 00:02:03.790 
could do you know there's a seventh or
Peggy<00:01:56.000> oh<00:02:01.479> that<00:02:02.479> doesn't<00:02:02.990> work<00:02:03.229> as<00:02:03.649> much

00:02:03.790 --> 00:02:03.800 
Peggy oh that doesn't work as much

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:06.219 
Peggy oh that doesn't work as much
string<00:02:04.250> skipping<00:02:04.490> but<00:02:04.880> it's<00:02:05.060> it<00:02:05.390> gets<00:02:05.570> the<00:02:05.810> two

00:02:06.219 --> 00:02:06.229 
string skipping but it's it gets the two

00:02:06.229 --> 00:02:07.870 
string skipping but it's it gets the two
notes<00:02:06.410> per<00:02:06.500> string<00:02:06.619> or<00:02:07.009> you<00:02:07.100> can<00:02:07.250> just<00:02:07.399> you

00:02:07.870 --> 00:02:07.880 
notes per string or you can just you

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:09.310 
notes per string or you can just you
know<00:02:07.910> run<00:02:08.119> through<00:02:08.330> pentatonic<00:02:08.959> and<00:02:09.050> some

00:02:09.310 --> 00:02:09.320 
know run through pentatonic and some

00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:15.820 
know run through pentatonic and some
sort<00:02:09.530> of<00:02:09.619> secret<00:02:14.290> yeah<00:02:15.290> I<00:02:15.320> find<00:02:15.590> that<00:02:15.709> was

00:02:15.820 --> 00:02:15.830 
sort of secret yeah I find that was

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:16.570 
sort of secret yeah I find that was

three<00:02:17.000> notes<00:02:17.180> per<00:02:17.390> string<00:02:17.420> I<00:02:17.959> like<00:02:18.770> to<00:02:18.890> do<00:02:19.010> a

00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:19.040 
three notes per string I like to do a

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:21.699 
three notes per string I like to do a
lot<00:02:19.220> of<00:02:19.280> string<00:02:19.670> skipping<00:02:19.910> because<00:02:20.390> I<00:02:21.170> don't

00:02:21.699 --> 00:02:21.709 
lot of string skipping because I don't

00:02:21.709 --> 00:02:24.070 
lot of string skipping because I don't
know<00:02:21.770> it<00:02:21.920> just<00:02:21.950> it<00:02:22.459> just<00:02:22.520> forces<00:02:23.300> you<00:02:23.330> you<00:02:23.959> know

00:02:24.070 --> 00:02:24.080 
know it just it just forces you you know

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:25.570 
know it just it just forces you you know
to<00:02:24.140> have<00:02:24.290> that<00:02:24.350> much<00:02:24.680> more<00:02:24.890> control<00:02:25.280> like<00:02:25.459> I

00:02:25.570 --> 00:02:25.580 
to have that much more control like I

00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:28.870 
to have that much more control like I
said<00:02:25.820> and<00:02:26.500> three<00:02:27.500> notes<00:02:27.680> per<00:02:28.280> string<00:02:28.310> can<00:02:28.730> get

00:02:28.870 --> 00:02:28.880 
said and three notes per string can get

00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:31.479 
said and three notes per string can get
tricky<00:02:29.090> because<00:02:29.620> when<00:02:30.620> you're<00:02:30.769> when<00:02:31.459> you're

00:02:31.479 --> 00:02:31.489 
tricky because when you're when you're

00:02:31.489 --> 00:02:33.670 
tricky because when you're when you're
going<00:02:32.239> to<00:02:32.450> the<00:02:32.540> next<00:02:32.690> string<00:02:33.049> you're<00:02:33.380> gonna<00:02:33.530> be

00:02:33.670 --> 00:02:33.680 
going to the next string you're gonna be

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:35.259 
going to the next string you're gonna be
starting<00:02:33.980> with<00:02:34.220> an<00:02:34.400> up<00:02:34.549> stroke<00:02:34.790> or<00:02:35.060> down

00:02:35.259 --> 00:02:35.269 
starting with an up stroke or down

00:02:35.269 --> 00:02:37.120 
starting with an up stroke or down
stroke<00:02:35.660> depending<00:02:36.470> on<00:02:36.560> what<00:02:36.709> you<00:02:36.769> star<00:02:36.980> the

00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:37.130 
stroke depending on what you star the

00:02:37.130 --> 00:02:39.840 
stroke depending on what you star the
neck<00:02:37.280> so<00:02:38.000> it's<00:02:38.840> strict<00:02:39.140> alternate<00:02:39.530> picking

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:39.850 
neck so it's strict alternate picking

00:02:39.850 --> 00:02:45.039 
neck so it's strict alternate picking
going<00:02:40.850> down<00:02:41.500> and<00:02:42.500> then<00:02:43.540> that<00:02:44.540> can<00:02:44.690> be<00:02:44.810> tricky

00:02:45.039 --> 00:02:45.049 
going down and then that can be tricky

00:02:45.049 --> 00:02:47.140 
going down and then that can be tricky
at<00:02:45.290> high<00:02:45.440> speeds<00:02:45.799> and<00:02:46.040> string<00:02:46.549> skipping<00:02:46.790> just

00:02:47.140 --> 00:02:47.150 
at high speeds and string skipping just

00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:51.840 
at high speeds and string skipping just
makes<00:02:47.330> you<00:02:47.480> focus<00:02:47.900> on

00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:51.850 

00:02:51.850 --> 00:03:11.850 

I<00:03:09.240> like<00:03:10.240> to<00:03:10.390> do<00:03:10.510> diatonically<00:03:11.230> it's<00:03:11.500> just<00:03:11.680> a

00:03:11.850 --> 00:03:11.860 
I like to do diatonically it's just a

00:03:11.860 --> 00:03:14.250 
I like to do diatonically it's just a
little<00:03:12.160> bit<00:03:12.280> more<00:03:12.580> musical<00:03:13.150> I<00:03:13.180> get<00:03:14.110> acclimated

00:03:14.250 --> 00:03:14.260 
little bit more musical I get acclimated

00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:17.850 
little bit more musical I get acclimated
to<00:03:14.860> how<00:03:15.490> the<00:03:15.550> modes<00:03:15.790> fit<00:03:16.060> together<00:03:16.650> same<00:03:17.650> thing

00:03:17.850 --> 00:03:17.860 
to how the modes fit together same thing

00:03:17.860 --> 00:03:29.220 
to how the modes fit together same thing
starting<00:03:18.130> with<00:03:18.490> an<00:03:18.640> upstroke<00:03:28.020> right<00:03:29.020> there

00:03:29.220 --> 00:03:29.230 
starting with an upstroke right there

00:03:29.230 --> 00:03:31.380 
starting with an upstroke right there
it's<00:03:29.890> actually<00:03:30.100> very<00:03:30.460> helpful<00:03:30.760> to<00:03:30.970> start<00:03:31.300> with

00:03:31.380 --> 00:03:31.390 
it's actually very helpful to start with

00:03:31.390 --> 00:03:43.410 
it's actually very helpful to start with
an<00:03:31.540> upstroke<00:03:31.900> because<00:03:41.070> then<00:03:42.070> when<00:03:42.310> doing<00:03:42.910> fors

00:03:43.410 --> 00:03:43.420 
an upstroke because then when doing fors

00:03:43.420 --> 00:03:46.770 
an upstroke because then when doing fors
there's<00:03:44.260> a<00:03:44.410> chromatic<00:03:45.220> switch<00:03:45.520> are<00:03:45.730> you<00:03:46.720> know

00:03:46.770 --> 00:03:46.780 
there's a chromatic switch are you know

00:03:46.780 --> 00:04:01.679 
there's a chromatic switch are you know
get<00:03:46.960> the<00:03:47.140> the<00:03:47.500> left<00:03:47.710> hand<00:03:47.920> moving<00:03:48.250> his<00:03:48.370> way

00:04:01.679 --> 00:04:01.689 

00:04:01.689 --> 00:04:05.170 

you<00:04:02.689> know<00:04:02.840> the<00:04:03.650> the<00:04:03.980> key<00:04:04.129> is<00:04:04.310> doing<00:04:04.879> it<00:04:05.090> again

00:04:05.170 --> 00:04:05.180 
you know the the key is doing it again

00:04:05.180 --> 00:04:07.209 
you know the the key is doing it again
starting<00:04:05.989> with<00:04:06.019> an<00:04:06.230> upstroke<00:04:06.650> that's<00:04:06.980> really

00:04:07.209 --> 00:04:07.219 
starting with an upstroke that's really

00:04:07.219 --> 00:04:10.089 
starting with an upstroke that's really
helpful<00:04:07.719> also<00:04:08.719> I'll<00:04:09.260> show<00:04:09.290> you<00:04:09.530> how<00:04:09.709> I<00:04:09.739> like<00:04:10.069> to

00:04:10.089 --> 00:04:10.099 
helpful also I'll show you how I like to

00:04:10.099 --> 00:04:13.030 
helpful also I'll show you how I like to
use<00:04:10.370> a<00:04:10.400> metronome<00:04:11.060> I<00:04:11.510> just<00:04:11.719> like<00:04:12.680> to<00:04:12.799> start

00:04:13.030 --> 00:04:13.040 
use a metronome I just like to start

00:04:13.040 --> 00:04:20.279 
use a metronome I just like to start
really<00:04:13.370> slow

00:04:20.279 --> 00:04:20.289 

00:04:20.289 --> 00:04:24.100 

I'll<00:04:21.289> bump<00:04:21.500> it<00:04:21.650> up<00:04:21.739> say<00:04:22.600> say<00:04:23.600> I<00:04:23.630> want<00:04:23.840> to<00:04:23.900> bump

00:04:24.100 --> 00:04:24.110 
I'll bump it up say say I want to bump

00:04:24.110 --> 00:04:32.740 
I'll bump it up say say I want to bump
it<00:04:24.199> up<00:04:24.289> four<00:04:24.949> beats<00:04:25.160> per<00:04:25.280> minute<00:04:30.940> and<00:04:31.940> then

00:04:32.740 --> 00:04:32.750 
it up four beats per minute and then

00:04:32.750 --> 00:04:44.260 
it up four beats per minute and then
I'll<00:04:32.870> go<00:04:32.990> back<00:04:33.020> down<00:04:33.380> to<00:04:33.410> two<00:04:33.800> and<00:04:34.639> so<00:04:42.460> and<00:04:43.460> then

00:04:44.260 --> 00:04:44.270 
I'll go back down to two and so and then

00:04:44.270 --> 00:04:47.620 
I'll go back down to two and so and then
I'll<00:04:44.620> go<00:04:45.620> forward<00:04:45.919> four<00:04:46.330> and<00:04:47.330> then<00:04:47.419> come<00:04:47.599> back

00:04:47.620 --> 00:04:47.630 
I'll go forward four and then come back

00:04:47.630 --> 00:04:49.810 
I'll go forward four and then come back
down<00:04:47.990> to<00:04:48.199> and<00:04:48.620> I<00:04:48.710> just<00:04:48.949> keep<00:04:49.460> doing<00:04:49.639> that

00:04:49.810 --> 00:04:49.820 
down to and I just keep doing that

00:04:49.820 --> 00:04:52.600 
down to and I just keep doing that
because<00:04:50.300> I<00:04:50.870> don't<00:04:51.860> know<00:04:52.039> it<00:04:52.130> just<00:04:52.160> helps<00:04:52.520> me

00:04:52.600 --> 00:04:52.610 
because I don't know it just helps me

00:04:52.610 --> 00:04:55.420 
because I don't know it just helps me
push<00:04:52.940> push<00:04:53.419> the<00:04:53.599> speed<00:04:53.900> a<00:04:53.930> little<00:04:54.199> bit<00:04:55.099> further

00:04:55.420 --> 00:04:55.430 
push push the speed a little bit further

00:04:55.430 --> 00:04:58.180 
push push the speed a little bit further
but<00:04:55.820> it<00:04:56.389> helps<00:04:56.720> me<00:04:56.840> maintain<00:04:57.020> accuracy<00:04:57.770> and

00:04:58.180 --> 00:04:58.190 
but it helps me maintain accuracy and

00:04:58.190 --> 00:05:01.870 
but it helps me maintain accuracy and
precision<00:04:58.780> I<00:04:59.919> know<00:05:00.919> it's<00:05:01.070> it's<00:05:01.460> one<00:05:01.729> of<00:05:01.789> those

00:05:01.870 --> 00:05:01.880 
precision I know it's it's one of those

00:05:01.880 --> 00:05:04.779 
precision I know it's it's one of those
things<00:05:02.120> also<00:05:02.690> when<00:05:02.870> I<00:05:02.900> feel<00:05:03.199> like<00:05:03.380> I<00:05:04.099> can't<00:05:04.639> go

00:05:04.779 --> 00:05:04.789 
things also when I feel like I can't go

00:05:04.789 --> 00:05:07.870 
things also when I feel like I can't go
much<00:05:05.000> faster<00:05:05.620> I'm<00:05:06.620> kind<00:05:06.860> of<00:05:06.949> at<00:05:07.130> my<00:05:07.370> peak<00:05:07.669> as

00:05:07.870 --> 00:05:07.880 
much faster I'm kind of at my peak as

00:05:07.880 --> 00:05:11.860 
much faster I'm kind of at my peak as
far<00:05:08.120> as<00:05:08.270> BPMS<00:05:08.930> go<00:05:09.080> or<00:05:09.470> go<00:05:09.800> I<00:05:10.639> don't<00:05:11.330> know<00:05:11.539> I'll

00:05:11.860 --> 00:05:11.870 
far as BPMS go or go I don't know I'll

00:05:11.870 --> 00:05:13.570 
far as BPMS go or go I don't know I'll
just<00:05:12.080> cut<00:05:12.380> it<00:05:12.470> back<00:05:12.590> a<00:05:12.650> couple<00:05:12.949> beats<00:05:13.220> and<00:05:13.490> then

00:05:13.570 --> 00:05:13.580 
just cut it back a couple beats and then

00:05:13.580 --> 00:05:15.700 
just cut it back a couple beats and then
try<00:05:13.760> and<00:05:13.789> jump<00:05:14.030> for<00:05:14.270> it<00:05:14.360> again<00:05:14.630> sometimes<00:05:15.530> that

00:05:15.700 --> 00:05:15.710 
try and jump for it again sometimes that

00:05:15.710 --> 00:05:18.520 
try and jump for it again sometimes that
works<00:05:15.889> sometimes<00:05:16.159> just<00:05:17.120> got<00:05:17.300> a<00:05:17.330> weight<00:05:18.289> tilt

00:05:18.520 --> 00:05:18.530 
works sometimes just got a weight tilt

00:05:18.530 --> 00:05:20.770 
works sometimes just got a weight tilt
or<00:05:18.740> the<00:05:19.639> metronome<00:05:20.060> really<00:05:20.270> helps<00:05:20.449> you<00:05:20.510> track

00:05:20.770 --> 00:05:20.780 
or the metronome really helps you track

00:05:20.780 --> 00:05:22.870 
or the metronome really helps you track
your<00:05:20.930> progress<00:05:21.139> so<00:05:21.590> that<00:05:21.770> you<00:05:21.889> can<00:05:22.070> see<00:05:22.729> we're

00:05:22.870 --> 00:05:22.880 
your progress so that you can see we're

00:05:22.880 --> 00:05:24.879 
your progress so that you can see we're
out<00:05:23.060> one<00:05:23.270> day<00:05:23.419> and<00:05:23.599> then<00:05:23.720> the<00:05:23.810> next<00:05:24.080> day<00:05:24.139> for

00:05:24.879 --> 00:05:24.889 
out one day and then the next day for

00:05:24.889 --> 00:05:26.800 
out one day and then the next day for
some<00:05:25.070> odd<00:05:25.220> reason<00:05:25.250> it<00:05:25.699> might<00:05:25.820> feel<00:05:26.090> slower<00:05:26.599> and

00:05:26.800 --> 00:05:26.810 
some odd reason it might feel slower and

00:05:26.810 --> 00:05:28.870 
some odd reason it might feel slower and
you're<00:05:27.020> just<00:05:27.400> just<00:05:28.400> playing<00:05:28.610> it<00:05:28.729> really

00:05:28.870 --> 00:05:28.880 
you're just just playing it really

00:05:28.880 --> 00:05:32.230 
you're just just playing it really
cleanly<00:05:29.389> and<00:05:29.570> um<00:05:30.080> I<00:05:30.580> don't<00:05:31.580> know<00:05:31.669> it's<00:05:32.000> a<00:05:32.090> good

00:05:32.230 --> 00:05:32.240 
cleanly and um I don't know it's a good

00:05:32.240 --> 00:05:33.640 
cleanly and um I don't know it's a good
way<00:05:32.360> to<00:05:32.419> let<00:05:32.599> you<00:05:32.750> know<00:05:32.900> where<00:05:33.080> you're<00:05:33.229> at<00:05:33.380> and

00:05:33.640 --> 00:05:33.650 
way to let you know where you're at and

00:05:33.650 --> 00:05:35.860 
way to let you know where you're at and
it's<00:05:34.490> very<00:05:34.669> encouraging<00:05:34.789> kind<00:05:35.510> of<00:05:35.599> lets<00:05:35.750> you

00:05:35.860 --> 00:05:35.870 
it's very encouraging kind of lets you

00:05:35.870 --> 00:05:37.120 
it's very encouraging kind of lets you
know<00:05:36.020> that<00:05:36.050> you<00:05:36.500> know<00:05:36.590> you<00:05:36.680> are<00:05:36.800> getting

00:05:37.120 --> 00:05:37.130 
know that you know you are getting

00:05:37.130 --> 00:05:39.670 
know that you know you are getting
better<00:05:37.460> and<00:05:37.849> you're<00:05:38.570> getting<00:05:38.750> cleaner<00:05:39.169> if

00:05:39.670 --> 00:05:39.680 
better and you're getting cleaner if

00:05:39.680 --> 00:05:41.649 
better and you're getting cleaner if
you're<00:05:39.949> paying<00:05:40.159> attention<00:05:40.610> to<00:05:40.789> that<00:05:40.909> sort<00:05:41.599> of

00:05:41.649 --> 00:05:41.659 
you're paying attention to that sort of

00:05:41.659 --> 00:05:42.320
