00:00:11.860 --> 00:00:16.789
 Nine people today I have a little 

00:00:14.410 --> 00:00:21.230
 comparison video for you and indeed 

00:00:16.789 --> 00:00:23.869
 let's compare the scm 22 here once 

00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:25.210
 the first version of the weapon from the end 

00:00:23.869 --> 00:00:28.849
 2012 

00:00:25.210 --> 00:00:31.880
 and here the extent of the latest variant 

00:00:28.849 --> 00:00:33.800
 weapon at the end of 2014 

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:35.030
 The first difference I got immediately into 

00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:37.489
 eye has fallen has the package 

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:41.059
 was open was the real 

00:00:37.489 --> 00:00:44.559
 packing the weapon the first variant 

00:00:41.059 --> 00:00:49.180
 the l22 was still in such a big one 

00:00:44.559 --> 00:00:51.850
 not very handsome plastic case 

00:00:49.180 --> 00:00:54.860
 way too big actually for the waffle 

00:00:51.850 --> 00:00:57.109
 the new variant comes in one 

00:00:54.860 --> 00:01:01.579
 significantly smaller, much slimmer 

00:00:57.109 --> 00:01:04.780
 and four send carton with the 

00:01:01.579 --> 00:01:07.970
 inscription of csc austria 

00:01:04.780 --> 00:01:09.679
 the scope of delivery has remained the same 

00:01:07.970 --> 00:01:13.100
 we have a very detailed one very much 

00:01:09.679 --> 00:01:21.259
 nice instructions to the pcb shot 

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:25.670
 Graduation mug as well as a tool for 

00:01:21.259 --> 00:01:27.320
 securing the weapon the technical 

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:27.890
 data of the weapon are all the same 

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:29.750
 remained 

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:31.310
 there is no difference who 

00:01:29.750 --> 00:01:35.960
 want to know more about it 

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:37.579
 please look here is scm 22 video of 

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:39.320
 less than two years ago 

00:01:37.579 --> 00:01:41.439
 I described everything like that 

00:01:39.320 --> 00:01:46.159
 weapon works how to handle it 

00:01:41.439 --> 00:01:48.310
 look at the next one please 

00:01:46.159 --> 00:01:52.820
 difference that I noticed is 

00:01:48.310 --> 00:01:56.540
 the new laser engraves the m 22 

00:01:52.820 --> 00:01:59.479
 clearly stronger is very nice white 

00:01:56.540 --> 00:02:02.530
 written very clearly and the the 

00:01:59.479 --> 00:02:06.619
 old variant is rather a little pale 

00:02:02.530 --> 00:02:08.329
 and something in my eyes 

00:02:06.619 --> 00:02:11.270
 I like the new version 

00:02:08.329 --> 00:02:13.430
 significantly better 

00:02:11.270 --> 00:02:15.040
 which of course has changed are the 

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:18.080
 shelling sign 

00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:20.720
 they have been something over one now 

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:23.540
 year anyway, there are now reformed 

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:26.440
 European uniform sign out of it 

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:36.440
 become if you can see 

00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:38.840
 the new weapon is cpm stamped there 

00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:45.320
 this is the new sign for the normal 

00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:50.960
 shot and the old variant he has 

00:02:45.320 --> 00:02:52.880
 still the good eagle there the good 

00:02:50.960 --> 00:02:55.310
 eagle with the end underneath which 

00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:57.140
 the same thing the same says the ptb 

00:02:55.310 --> 00:02:59.900
 number's balance course 

00:02:57.140 --> 00:03:02.990
 also changed with this weapon 

00:02:59.900 --> 00:03:05.180
 the shelling place and that was the 

00:03:02.990 --> 00:03:08.840
 old still in germany decided in 

00:03:05.180 --> 00:03:10.870
 mellrichstadt is the new one now in 

00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:13.180
 Austria was shot at 

00:03:10.870 --> 00:03:18.080
 We recognize that here on this eagle 

00:03:13.180 --> 00:03:21.530
 and also at this lettering vwf the 

00:03:18.080 --> 00:03:23.510
 replaced or it is in Austria the 

00:03:21.530 --> 00:03:24.670
 Caption when is she shot at? 

00:03:23.510 --> 00:03:28.240
 were 

00:03:24.670 --> 00:03:30.650
 the first number or the first letter 

00:03:28.240 --> 00:03:34.940
 indicates the month 

00:03:30.650 --> 00:03:35.750
 v stands for november wf is at the 

00:03:34.940 --> 00:03:39.830
 date 

00:03:35.750 --> 00:03:41.680
 is 1 and f is four so 

00:03:39.830 --> 00:03:43.880
 november 2014 

00:03:41.680 --> 00:03:47.000
 otherwise, nothing is so far outwardly 

00:03:43.880 --> 00:03:50.260
 done at the beginning was the 22 

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:52.870
 only in black and I mean with one 

00:03:50.260 --> 00:03:55.640
 to get nickel-plated sleds 

00:03:52.870 --> 00:03:59.560
 today she is also like this in here 

00:03:55.640 --> 00:04:02.959
 digital camera available and in white 

00:03:59.560 --> 00:04:05.980
 completely on the magazines of weapons 

00:04:02.959 --> 00:04:05.980
 nothing changes 

00:04:09.140 --> 00:04:15.740
 also on the handle pieces as well as start 

00:04:13.310 --> 00:04:17.959
 cartridges chambers or cartridges chamber 

00:04:15.740 --> 00:04:19.250
 and an overall mechanics has changed 

00:04:17.959 --> 00:04:20.870
 nothing changed it still is 

00:04:19.250 --> 00:04:23.540
 the same decisive part of steel 

00:04:20.870 --> 00:04:26.600
 made and the handle piece from a 

00:04:23.540 --> 00:04:28.090
 very high quality polymer what you 

00:04:26.600 --> 00:04:31.970
 however have improved 

00:04:28.090 --> 00:04:34.220
 sled is the bolt it was yes 

00:04:31.970 --> 00:04:38.060
 at the first version the weak point 

00:04:34.220 --> 00:04:40.130
 when inserting or using the 

00:04:38.060 --> 00:04:40.990
 relaxed working has become a frequently 

00:04:40.130 --> 00:04:44.290
 shot solved 

00:04:40.990 --> 00:04:47.630
 simply by the fact that the impact bolt 

00:04:44.290 --> 00:04:48.740
 Despite the safety world, from the hammer 

00:04:47.630 --> 00:04:51.490
 was slightly touched 

00:04:48.740 --> 00:04:54.100
 and that was enough for the cartridge 

00:04:51.490 --> 00:04:55.910
 to trigger 

00:04:54.100 --> 00:05:00.140
 they have that with the new one now 

00:04:55.910 --> 00:05:02.750
 changed here once the old one there 

00:05:00.140 --> 00:05:07.940
 her the bolt when I am now 

00:05:02.750 --> 00:05:11.110
 You're in for a safety walzer 

00:05:07.940 --> 00:05:13.970
 there is not much air 

00:05:11.110 --> 00:05:18.940
 that is basically the conclusion of the 

00:05:13.970 --> 00:05:23.690
 stopper really directly flush with 

00:05:18.940 --> 00:05:28.490
 Safety continues with the new 

00:05:23.690 --> 00:05:31.610
 Variation is a little prettier than me 

00:05:28.490 --> 00:05:34.790
 here again the latch something 

00:05:31.610 --> 00:05:35.930
 shorter than the old version above 

00:05:34.790 --> 00:05:38.570
 insert the roller here 

00:05:35.930 --> 00:05:43.100
 then you see that disappears right 

00:05:38.570 --> 00:05:44.630
 in the roller he is so right place 

00:05:43.100 --> 00:05:49.820
 created between hammer and 

00:05:44.630 --> 00:05:51.530
 still comes at that impact 

00:05:49.820 --> 00:05:53.270
 the new variant in inertia 

00:05:51.530 --> 00:05:55.160
 should be used 

00:05:53.270 --> 00:05:58.510
 now the hammer on the catchwords 

00:05:55.160 --> 00:06:03.320
 lie with the old variant so 

00:05:58.510 --> 00:06:07.580
 flush impressions we see there 

00:06:03.320 --> 00:06:10.400
 Shock bolt is already a bit ahead 

00:06:07.580 --> 00:06:15.400
 and already touches the center 

00:06:10.400 --> 00:06:15.400
 the cartouche 

00:06:16.900 --> 00:06:25.480
 in the new variant as I the 

00:06:19.610 --> 00:06:25.480
 firing pin back flush and clean 

00:06:31.639 --> 00:06:37.360
 we do not see that by a long way 

00:06:34.400 --> 00:06:37.360
 comes out far 

00:06:44.139 --> 00:06:52.180
 it if you really far into 

00:06:47.680 --> 00:06:54.419
 the watch pin looks forward 

00:06:52.180 --> 00:06:54.419
 out 

00:06:54.749 --> 00:06:58.740
 In conclusion, I can say it has changed 

00:06:56.710 --> 00:07:01.449
 something done at the 22 

00:06:58.740 --> 00:07:04.150
 everything to the positive started with the 

00:07:01.449 --> 00:07:08.770
 Packaging beyond the lettering 

00:07:04.150 --> 00:07:11.580
 to the stopper problematic and yet 

00:07:08.770 --> 00:07:14.860
 to the new color options and 

00:07:11.580 --> 00:07:17.259
 especially this digital camera has that 

00:07:14.860 --> 00:07:21.509
 really convinced me 

00:07:17.259 --> 00:07:21.509
 I think that's awesome 

00:07:34.529 --> 00:07:39.299
 I hope the video I had a 

00:07:36.299 --> 00:07:42.229
 helped a bit and see you in the 

00:07:39.299 --> 00:07:42.229
 next to because
