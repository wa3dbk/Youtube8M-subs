I'm actually standing a good 10 feet

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:24.320 
I'm actually standing a good 10 feet
away<00:00:18.539> from<00:00:18.779> this<00:00:19.340> child<00:00:20.420> thing<00:00:21.420> so<00:00:23.269> yeah<00:00:24.269> I

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:24.330 
away from this child thing so yeah I

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:29.689 
away from this child thing so yeah I
will<00:00:24.720> get<00:00:24.930> closer<00:00:27.019> so<00:00:28.019> this<00:00:28.710> is<00:00:28.740> not<00:00:29.130> your

00:00:29.689 --> 00:00:29.699 
will get closer so this is not your

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:33.830 
will get closer so this is not your
typical<00:00:31.579> so<00:00:32.579> you<00:00:32.669> monitor<00:00:33.120> triple<00:00:33.450> monitor

00:00:33.830 --> 00:00:33.840 
typical so you monitor triple monitor

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:38.720 
typical so you monitor triple monitor
system<00:00:34.550> alright<00:00:35.550> so<00:00:36.890> this<00:00:37.890> each<00:00:38.219> monitor

00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:38.730 
system alright so this each monitor

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:41.569 
system alright so this each monitor
costs<00:00:39.420> about<00:00:39.629> two<00:00:39.960> hundred<00:00:40.110> fifty<00:00:40.579> dollar

00:00:41.569 --> 00:00:41.579 
costs about two hundred fifty dollar

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:45.529 
costs about two hundred fifty dollar
Canadian<00:00:42.270> dollars<00:00:43.730> all<00:00:44.730> right<00:00:44.879> so<00:00:45.149> these<00:00:45.329> are

00:00:45.529 --> 00:00:45.539 
Canadian dollars all right so these are

00:00:45.539 --> 00:00:48.770 
Canadian dollars all right so these are
IPS<00:00:45.989> panels<00:00:46.640> these<00:00:47.640> are<00:00:47.789> professional<00:00:48.480> pairs

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:48.780 
IPS panels these are professional pairs

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:52.340 
IPS panels these are professional pairs
so<00:00:49.340> these<00:00:50.340> things<00:00:50.640> have<00:00:50.969> an<00:00:51.239> amazing<00:00:52.020> viewing

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:52.350 
so these things have an amazing viewing

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:54.410 
so these things have an amazing viewing
angles<00:00:52.770> and<00:00:52.980> amazing<00:00:53.820> calabrese

00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:54.420 
angles and amazing calabrese

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:59.869 
angles and amazing calabrese
reproduction<00:00:55.079> so<00:00:55.890> these<00:00:56.250> r<00:00:56.460> del<00:00:56.699> u<00:00:57.620> u2412m<00:00:58.879> so

00:00:59.869 --> 00:00:59.879 
reproduction so these r del u u2412m so

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:06.530 
reproduction so these r del u u2412m so
it<00:01:00.870> costs<00:01:01.230> about<00:01:01.410> 250<00:01:02.329> so<00:01:03.329> it<00:01:03.510> but<00:01:04.470> 750<00:01:05.420> for<00:01:06.420> the

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:06.540 
it costs about 250 so it but 750 for the

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:15.380 
it costs about 250 so it but 750 for the
just<00:01:07.320> for<00:01:07.560> the<00:01:07.650> three<00:01:07.950> monitors<00:01:13.310> engineer<00:01:14.390> so

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:15.390 
just for the three monitors engineer so

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:18.380 
just for the three monitors engineer so
this<00:01:15.960> is<00:01:15.990> my<00:01:16.080> friend<00:01:16.380> time<00:01:16.650> actually<00:01:17.580> it's<00:01:18.210> his

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:18.390 
this is my friend time actually it's his

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:19.820 
this is my friend time actually it's his
computer<00:01:18.810> so<00:01:19.020> he's<00:01:19.229> trying<00:01:19.500> to<00:01:19.619> play<00:01:19.799> a

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:22.290 
battlefield 3 the conquest on casting

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:25.880 
battlefield 3 the conquest on casting
ball<00:01:22.470> right<00:01:22.790> yeah<00:01:23.790> so<00:01:24.299> I<00:01:24.740> forgot<00:01:25.740> to<00:01:25.860> mention

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:25.890 
ball right yeah so I forgot to mention

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:30.380 
ball right yeah so I forgot to mention
these<00:01:26.790> monitors<00:01:27.330> this<00:01:27.659> thing<00:01:27.869> has<00:01:28.460> 12<00:01:29.460> 1900<00:01:30.270> x

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:30.390 
these monitors this thing has 12 1900 x

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:35.899 
these monitors this thing has 12 1900 x
1200<00:01:31.130> resolution<00:01:32.130> each<00:01:32.759> so<00:01:33.950> with<00:01:34.950> saran

00:01:35.899 --> 00:01:35.909 
1200 resolution each so with saran

00:01:35.909 --> 00:01:38.390 
1200 resolution each so with saran
mission<00:01:36.299> nvidia<00:01:36.869> surround<00:01:37.049> sting<00:01:38.009> comes<00:01:38.159> up

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:38.400 
mission nvidia surround sting comes up

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:43.270 
mission nvidia surround sting comes up
to<00:01:39.650> 5930<00:01:40.650> into<00:01:41.040> 1200<00:01:41.640> with<00:01:42.450> basal<00:01:42.810> correction

00:01:43.270 --> 00:01:43.280 
to 5930 into 1200 with basal correction

00:01:43.280 --> 00:02:25.250 
to 5930 into 1200 with basal correction
so<00:01:44.280> let's<00:01:44.939> see<00:01:45.119> some<00:01:45.329> more<00:01:45.479> battlefield<00:01:45.780> glory

00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:25.260 

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:28.429 

so<00:02:26.220> the<00:02:26.670> triple<00:02:27.299> monitors<00:02:27.720> around<00:02:28.019> this<00:02:28.170> place

00:02:28.429 --> 00:02:28.439 
so the triple monitors around this place

00:02:28.439 --> 00:02:32.569 
so the triple monitors around this place
it<00:02:28.769> setup<00:02:29.370> was<00:02:29.610> powered<00:02:29.909> by<00:02:30.030> this<00:02:30.510> gtx<00:02:31.290> 590<00:02:31.709> so

00:02:32.569 --> 00:02:32.579 
it setup was powered by this gtx 590 so

00:02:32.579 --> 00:02:36.259 
it setup was powered by this gtx 590 so
this<00:02:32.819> whole<00:02:32.970> piece<00:02:33.269> is<00:02:33.510> based<00:02:33.870> around<00:02:34.310> this<00:02:35.310> so

00:02:36.259 --> 00:02:36.269 
this whole piece is based around this so

00:02:36.269 --> 00:02:40.009 
this whole piece is based around this so
to<00:02:36.599> start<00:02:36.659> off<00:02:37.129> we<00:02:38.129> have<00:02:38.340> the<00:02:38.819> CPU<00:02:39.299> it's<00:02:39.810> a

00:02:40.009 --> 00:02:40.019 
to start off we have the CPU it's a

00:02:40.019 --> 00:02:45.699 
to start off we have the CPU it's a
quasi<00:02:40.379> 720<00:02:40.950> 700<00:02:41.459> k<00:02:41.730> that's<00:02:42.569> a<00:02:42.890> 155<00:02:44.120> LGA<00:02:45.120> 1155

00:02:45.699 --> 00:02:45.709 
quasi 720 700 k that's a 155 LGA 1155

00:02:45.709 --> 00:02:49.640 
quasi 720 700 k that's a 155 LGA 1155
CPU<00:02:46.909> that's<00:02:47.909> the<00:02:48.000> second<00:02:48.329> generation<00:02:48.450> so<00:02:49.110> it's

00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:49.650 
CPU that's the second generation so it's

00:02:49.650 --> 00:02:51.550 
CPU that's the second generation so it's
clocked<00:02:50.010> at<00:02:50.190> four<00:02:50.430> points<00:02:50.610> to<00:02:50.849> the<00:02:51.000> guards<00:02:51.329> and

00:02:51.550 --> 00:02:51.560 
clocked at four points to the guards and

00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:55.099 
clocked at four points to the guards and
all<00:02:52.700> that<00:02:53.700> heat<00:02:53.970> and<00:02:54.269> everything<00:02:54.629> is<00:02:54.780> cooled

00:02:55.099 --> 00:02:55.109 
all that heat and everything is cooled

00:02:55.109 --> 00:03:00.500 
all that heat and everything is cooled
by<00:02:55.170> this<00:02:55.769> a<00:02:56.239> cozy<00:02:57.239> h<00:02:57.420> 100<00:02:58.549> right<00:02:59.549> there<00:02:59.579> was<00:03:00.480> a

00:03:06.530 --> 00:03:06.540 
pump so the memory it's a corsair
