00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:28.980 
to do a short range of motion and just

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:30.980 
to do a short range of motion and just
do<00:00:29.160> the<00:00:29.340> extension<00:00:29.670> at<00:00:29.940> a<00:00:29.970> time<00:00:30.240> which<00:00:30.690> put

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:30.990 
do the extension at a time which put

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:32.930 
do the extension at a time which put
some<00:00:31.230> stress<00:00:31.560> upon<00:00:31.830> the<00:00:31.950> delts<00:00:32.219> but<00:00:32.789> not

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:32.940

some stress upon the delts but not
really<00:00:33.120> enough<00:00:33.239> to<00:00:33.860> justify<00:00:34.860> doing<00:00:35.280> it<00:00:35.370> as<00:00:35.429> a

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:35.460 
really enough to justify doing it as a

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:37.520 
really enough to justify doing it as a
shoulder<00:00:35.760> press<00:00:35.940> so<00:00:36.749> what<00:00:37.079> I'm<00:00:37.170> going<00:00:37.320> to<00:00:37.350> show

00:00:51.319 --> 00:00:51.329 
backwards because I want to have that

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:53.750 
backwards because I want to have that
bar<00:00:51.569> pad<00:00:51.809> right<00:00:52.710> in<00:00:52.920> my<00:00:53.010> kind<00:00:53.370> of<00:00:53.399> mid-back

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:53.760 
bar pad right in my kind of mid-back

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:56.540 
bar pad right in my kind of mid-back
area<00:00:54.120> it's<00:00:54.629> that<00:00:54.809> way<00:00:54.960> I<00:00:55.289> can<00:00:55.739> keep<00:00:55.889> my<00:00:56.039> arms

00:00:56.540 --> 00:00:56.550 
area it's that way I can keep my arms

00:00:56.550 --> 00:00:58.790 
area it's that way I can keep my arms
totally<00:00:56.999> free<00:00:57.239> and<00:00:57.600> I'm<00:00:57.899> not<00:00:58.050> forced<00:00:58.499> into<00:00:58.739> a

00:00:58.790 --> 00:00:58.800 
totally free and I'm not forced into a

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:00.439 
totally free and I'm not forced into a
straight<00:00:59.069> up-and-down<00:00:59.249> vertical<00:00:59.850> position

00:01:00.439 --> 00:01:00.449 
straight up-and-down vertical position

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:02.029 
straight up-and-down vertical position
which<00:01:00.960> I<00:01:01.079> find<00:01:01.350> actually<00:01:01.469> it's<00:01:01.739> not<00:01:01.829> really

00:01:02.029 --> 00:01:02.039 
which I find actually it's not really

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:04.579 
which I find actually it's not really
good<00:01:02.190> for<00:01:02.399> getting<00:01:02.579> the<00:01:02.789> back<00:01:02.969> so<00:01:03.749> the

00:01:04.579 --> 00:01:04.589 
good for getting the back so the

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:07.250 
good for getting the back so the
shoulders<00:01:05.090> so<00:01:06.090> what<00:01:06.330> I'm<00:01:06.420> gonna<00:01:06.510> do<00:01:06.720> here<00:01:06.990> is

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:07.260

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:09.260 
shoulders so what I'm gonna do here is
instead<00:01:08.220> of<00:01:08.340> having<00:01:08.490> somebody<00:01:08.760> hand<00:01:09.030> these<00:01:09.150> to

00:01:31.430 --> 00:01:31.440 
shoulder up and to test the dumbbell

00:01:31.440 --> 00:01:33.350 
shoulder up and to test the dumbbell
plate<00:01:31.650> and<00:01:31.800> as<00:01:31.860> you're<00:01:31.980> coming<00:01:32.010> up<00:01:32.310> what<00:01:33.210> that

00:01:34.970 --> 00:01:34.980 
does is it actually takes tension off

00:01:34.980 --> 00:01:37.610 
does is it actually takes tension off
the<00:01:35.250> triceps<00:01:35.700> and<00:01:36.090> forces<00:01:36.690> your<00:01:36.870> deltoids<00:01:37.470> to

00:01:37.610 --> 00:01:37.620 
the triceps and forces your deltoids to

00:01:37.620 --> 00:01:38.140 
the triceps and forces your deltoids to
activate

00:01:38.140 --> 00:01:38.150

more<00:01:38.420> because<00:01:38.780> as<00:01:39.320> you<00:01:39.500> can<00:01:39.620> see<00:01:39.770> this<00:01:40.000> kind<00:01:41.000> of

00:01:41.050 --> 00:01:41.060 
more because as you can see this kind of

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:43.570 
more because as you can see this kind of
movement<00:01:41.240> raising<00:01:42.140> the<00:01:42.230> shoulder<00:01:42.560> up<00:01:42.710> brings

00:01:43.570 --> 00:01:43.580 
movement raising the shoulder up brings

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:45.400 
movement raising the shoulder up brings
the<00:01:43.700> Delta<00:01:43.940> it's<00:01:44.090> in<00:01:44.180> the<00:01:44.270> plate<00:01:44.480> now<00:01:45.110> when

00:01:45.400 --> 00:01:45.410 
the Delta it's in the plate now when

00:01:45.410 --> 00:01:47.710 
the Delta it's in the plate now when
you're<00:01:45.530> doing<00:01:45.620> a<00:01:46.160> regular<00:01:46.550> press<00:01:46.970> one<00:01:47.540> thing

00:01:47.710 --> 00:01:47.720 
you're doing a regular press one thing

00:01:47.720 --> 00:01:49.870 
you're doing a regular press one thing
you<00:01:47.810> want<00:01:47.960> to<00:01:47.990> do<00:01:48.140> is<00:01:48.380> not<00:01:48.680> shrug<00:01:49.460> them<00:01:49.610> up<00:01:49.700> as

00:01:49.870 --> 00:01:49.880 
you want to do is not shrug them up as

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:51.220 
you want to do is not shrug them up as
you're<00:01:50.060> pressing<00:01:50.300> you<00:01:50.720> want<00:01:50.840> to<00:01:50.900> shrug<00:01:51.110> them

00:01:51.220 --> 00:01:51.230 
you're pressing you want to shrug them

00:01:51.230 --> 00:01:54.010 
you're pressing you want to shrug them
up<00:01:51.680> as<00:01:52.610> you're<00:01:52.790> coming<00:01:52.940> down<00:01:53.210> that's<00:01:53.720> really

00:01:54.010 --> 00:01:54.020 
up as you're coming down that's really

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:55.240 
up as you're coming down that's really
one<00:01:54.140> of<00:01:54.170> the<00:01:54.290> key<00:01:54.410> differences<00:01:54.590> that<00:01:55.040> a<00:01:55.100> lot<00:01:55.190> of

00:01:55.240 --> 00:01:55.250 
one of the key differences that a lot of

00:01:55.250 --> 00:01:56.920 
one of the key differences that a lot of
people<00:01:55.490> who<00:01:55.610> get<00:01:55.760> mixed<00:01:56.060> up<00:01:56.150> in<00:01:56.330> when<00:01:56.840> you

00:01:56.920 --> 00:01:56.930 
people who get mixed up in when you

00:01:56.930 --> 00:01:58.930 
people who get mixed up in when you
shrug<00:01:57.230> it<00:01:57.380> up<00:01:57.470> as<00:01:57.650> you're<00:01:57.800> pressing<00:01:57.980> that

00:01:58.930 --> 00:01:58.940 
shrug it up as you're pressing that

00:01:58.940 --> 00:02:00.580 
shrug it up as you're pressing that
involves<00:01:59.390> the<00:01:59.450> traps<00:01:59.690> too<00:01:59.900> much<00:02:00.050> it<00:02:00.260> changes

00:02:00.580 --> 00:02:00.590 
involves the traps too much it changes

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:01.870 
involves the traps too much it changes
the<00:02:00.710> angle<00:02:00.740> it<00:02:01.070> takes<00:02:01.220> tension<00:02:01.460> off<00:02:01.700> of<00:02:01.760> the

00:02:01.870 --> 00:02:01.880 
the angle it takes tension off of the

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:04.210 
the angle it takes tension off of the
delts<00:02:02.180> movement<00:02:02.540> so<00:02:02.890> instead<00:02:03.890> of<00:02:03.950> shrugging

00:02:04.210 --> 00:02:04.220 
delts movement so instead of shrugging

00:02:04.220 --> 00:02:05.980 
delts movement so instead of shrugging
up<00:02:04.430> as<00:02:04.580> you<00:02:04.700> come<00:02:04.850> you<00:02:05.360> actually<00:02:05.720> that<00:02:05.870> your

00:02:05.980 --> 00:02:05.990 
up as you come you actually that your

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:08.020 
up as you come you actually that your
shoulders<00:02:06.260> down<00:02:06.470> as<00:02:06.770> you<00:02:06.860> press<00:02:07.070> up<00:02:07.250> and<00:02:07.580> then

00:02:08.020 --> 00:02:08.030 
shoulders down as you press up and then

00:02:08.030 --> 00:02:10.930 
shoulders down as you press up and then
up<00:02:08.210> as<00:02:09.200> you<00:02:09.410> will<00:02:09.590> row<00:02:09.770> and<00:02:10.070> then<00:02:10.220> down<00:02:10.429> as<00:02:10.820> you

00:02:10.930 --> 00:02:10.940 
up as you will row and then down as you

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:12.970 
up as you will row and then down as you
press<00:02:11.150> up<00:02:11.180> and<00:02:11.600> up<00:02:12.200> as<00:02:12.350> you<00:02:12.470> lower<00:02:12.620> away

00:02:12.970 --> 00:02:12.980 
press up and up as you lower away

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:14.710 
press up and up as you lower away
so<00:02:13.190> that's<00:02:13.520> really<00:02:13.700> one<00:02:14.090> of<00:02:14.120> the<00:02:14.240> main<00:02:14.390> tricks

00:02:14.710 --> 00:02:14.720 
so that's really one of the main tricks

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:16.330 
so that's really one of the main tricks
that<00:02:15.200> I<00:02:15.230> found<00:02:15.500> they're<00:02:15.650> really<00:02:15.890> focused<00:02:16.250> on

00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:16.340 
that I found they're really focused on

00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:19.240 
that I found they're really focused on
the<00:02:16.430> delts<00:02:16.670> and<00:02:16.970> the<00:02:17.300> other<00:02:17.420> one<00:02:17.660> is<00:02:18.250> decrease

00:02:19.240 --> 00:02:19.250 
the delts and the other one is decrease

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:20.470 
the delts and the other one is decrease
the<00:02:19.370> amount<00:02:19.430> of<00:02:19.670> weight<00:02:19.820> that<00:02:19.850> you're<00:02:20.120> using

00:02:20.470 --> 00:02:20.480 
the amount of weight that you're using

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:22.000 
the amount of weight that you're using
most<00:02:21.020> people<00:02:21.260> use<00:02:21.380> way<00:02:21.530> too<00:02:21.590> much<00:02:21.800> weight<00:02:21.980> for

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:22.010 
most people use way too much weight for

00:02:22.010 --> 00:02:23.890 
most people use way too much weight for
these<00:02:22.280> they<00:02:22.850> want<00:02:23.030> to<00:02:23.090> drain<00:02:23.300> basically<00:02:23.810> to

00:02:23.890 --> 00:02:23.900 
these they want to drain basically to

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:25.690 
these they want to drain basically to
show<00:02:24.050> off<00:02:24.170> how<00:02:24.290> much<00:02:24.440> they<00:02:24.560> can<00:02:24.709> do<00:02:24.830> where<00:02:25.430> the

00:02:25.690 --> 00:02:25.700 
show off how much they can do where the

00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:27.370 
show off how much they can do where the
deltoids<00:02:26.090> really<00:02:26.450> don't<00:02:26.690> respond<00:02:27.140> well<00:02:27.230> to

00:02:27.370 --> 00:02:27.380 
deltoids really don't respond well to

00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:28.840 
deltoids really don't respond well to
that<00:02:27.590> kind<00:02:27.650> of<00:02:27.890> training<00:02:28.190> you<00:02:28.340> really<00:02:28.610> want<00:02:28.790> to

00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:28.850 
that kind of training you really want to

00:02:28.850 --> 00:02:31.449 
that kind of training you really want to
make<00:02:28.940> sure<00:02:28.970> you're<00:02:29.150> doing<00:02:29.209> strict<00:02:30.100> rep<00:02:31.100> with

00:02:31.449 --> 00:02:31.459 
make sure you're doing strict rep with

00:02:31.459 --> 00:02:32.920 
make sure you're doing strict rep with
moderate<00:02:31.760> weight<00:02:32.000> and<00:02:32.360> it's<00:02:32.570> really<00:02:32.720> going<00:02:32.840> to

00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:32.930 
moderate weight and it's really going to

00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:34.570 
moderate weight and it's really going to
help<00:02:33.020> out<00:02:33.230> with<00:02:33.680> your<00:02:33.830> shoulder<00:02:34.100> development

00:02:34.570 --> 00:02:34.580 
help out with your shoulder development

00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:37.660 
help out with your shoulder development
and<00:02:34.820> I<00:02:35.000> can<00:02:35.150> take<00:02:35.360> it<00:02:35.450> for<00:02:35.540> me<00:02:36.100> basically<00:02:37.100> the

00:02:37.660 --> 00:02:37.670 
and I can take it for me basically the

00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:39.130 
and I can take it for me basically the
shoulders<00:02:38.000> one<00:02:38.120> of<00:02:38.270> my<00:02:38.330> worst<00:02:38.480> body<00:02:38.750> parts<00:02:39.020> and

00:02:39.130 --> 00:02:39.140 
shoulders one of my worst body parts and

00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:40.660 
shoulders one of my worst body parts and
I've<00:02:39.200> really<00:02:39.410> had<00:02:39.500> to<00:02:39.620> work<00:02:39.740> hard<00:02:40.010> to<00:02:40.280> get<00:02:40.459> any

00:02:40.660 --> 00:02:40.670 
I've really had to work hard to get any

00:02:40.670 --> 00:02:41.620 
I've really had to work hard to get any
certain<00:02:40.940> piece<00:02:41.060> of<00:02:41.090> strength<00:02:41.480> and

00:02:41.620 --> 00:02:41.630 
certain piece of strength and

00:02:41.630 --> 00:02:43.479 
certain piece of strength and
development<00:02:42.020> from<00:02:42.200> them<00:02:42.350> so<00:02:42.890> this<00:02:43.160> is<00:02:43.220> one<00:02:43.459> of

00:02:43.479 --> 00:02:43.489 
development from them so this is one of

00:02:43.489 --> 00:02:44.830 
development from them so this is one of
the<00:02:43.610> things<00:02:43.790> that<00:02:43.910> I<00:02:44.000> found<00:02:44.209> is<00:02:44.510> that<00:02:44.600> when<00:02:44.720> I

00:02:44.830 --> 00:02:44.840 
the things that I found is that when I

00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:45.940 
the things that I found is that when I
actually<00:02:44.959> lighten<00:02:45.260> up<00:02:45.350> on<00:02:45.500> the<00:02:45.590> weight<00:02:45.739> and

00:02:45.940 --> 00:02:45.950 
actually lighten up on the weight and

00:02:45.950 --> 00:02:48.670 
actually lighten up on the weight and
don't<00:02:46.430> try<00:02:46.730> and<00:02:46.790> you<00:02:47.360> know<00:02:47.390> push<00:02:47.690> them<00:02:47.840> that's

00:02:48.670 --> 00:02:48.680 
don't try and you know push them that's

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:50.250 
don't try and you know push them that's
when<00:02:48.920> I<00:02:48.950> really<00:02:49.220> get<00:02:49.310> the<00:02:49.400> best<00:02:49.580> results<00:02:49.940> so

00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:50.260 
when I really get the best results so

00:02:50.260 --> 00:03:52.530 
when I really get the best results so
that's<00:02:51.260> nothing<00:02:51.470> let's<00:02:51.739> get<00:02:51.890> cracking

00:03:52.530 --> 00:03:52.540 

00:03:52.540 --> 00:03:54.809 

so<00:03:53.019> that's<00:03:53.170> to<00:03:53.260> see<00:03:53.409> them<00:03:53.620> the<00:03:53.709> oppressed<00:03:54.040> as

00:03:54.809 --> 00:03:54.819 
so that's to see them the oppressed as

00:03:54.819 --> 00:03:56.940 
so that's to see them the oppressed as
you<00:03:55.030> can<00:03:55.150> see<00:03:55.299> this<00:03:55.629> supposing<00:03:55.959> that<00:03:55.989> a<00:03:56.349> power

00:03:56.940 --> 00:03:56.950 
you can see this supposing that a power

00:03:56.950 --> 00:03:58.949 
you can see this supposing that a power
press<00:03:57.280> kind<00:03:57.640> of<00:03:57.730> movement<00:03:58.030> is<00:03:58.540> very<00:03:58.780> strict

00:03:58.949 --> 00:03:58.959 
press kind of movement is very strict

00:03:58.959 --> 00:04:00.990 
press kind of movement is very strict
it's<00:03:59.200> under<00:03:59.409> control<00:03:59.610> you<00:04:00.610> want<00:04:00.700> to<00:04:00.819> really

00:04:00.990 --> 00:04:01.000 
it's under control you want to really

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:03.030 
it's under control you want to really
take<00:04:01.090> it<00:04:01.360> so<00:04:01.750> that<00:04:01.900> you're<00:04:02.650> really<00:04:02.739> feeling

00:04:03.030 --> 00:04:03.040 
take it so that you're really feeling

00:04:03.040 --> 00:04:05.009
