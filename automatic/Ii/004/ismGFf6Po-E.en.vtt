three by three trench like here and

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:53.170 
three by three trench like here and
that'll<00:00:51.000> be<00:00:51.149> the<00:00:52.050> area<00:00:52.350> we're<00:00:52.469> going<00:00:52.620> to<00:00:52.710> use

00:00:53.170 --> 00:00:53.180

okay so for the the table that's gonna
have<00:00:58.620> to<00:00:58.649> go<00:01:00.079> up<00:01:01.079> on<00:01:01.350> the<00:01:01.410> floor<00:01:01.649> there<00:01:01.890> so<00:01:02.280> when

00:01:02.479 --> 00:01:02.489 
have to go up on the floor there so when

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:05.840 
have to go up on the floor there so when
that<00:01:02.640> lifts<00:01:03.120> once<00:01:03.710> they'll<00:01:04.710> be<00:01:04.949> in<00:01:05.250> line<00:01:05.549> with

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:05.850 
that lifts once they'll be in line with

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:10.490 
that lifts once they'll be in line with
the<00:01:06.560> the<00:01:07.560> height<00:01:07.799> of<00:01:07.979> the<00:01:08.100> body<00:01:09.170> then<00:01:10.170> we're

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:10.500 
the the height of the body then we're

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:12.140 
the the height of the body then we're
gonna<00:01:10.619> have<00:01:10.830> to<00:01:10.860> use<00:01:11.130> sticky<00:01:11.549> pistons<00:01:11.970> and

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:12.150 
gonna have to use sticky pistons and

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:13.429 
gonna have to use sticky pistons and
because<00:01:12.450> we<00:01:12.540> want<00:01:12.720> the<00:01:12.840> chairs<00:01:13.110> to<00:01:13.260> come

there and there

00:01:53.479 --> 00:01:55.999 
there and there
you<00:01:54.479> can<00:01:54.630> space<00:01:54.960> these<00:01:55.259> out<00:01:55.470> so<00:01:55.530> if<00:01:55.860> you<00:01:55.979> want

00:01:55.999 --> 00:01:56.009 
you can space these out so if you want

00:01:56.009 --> 00:01:58.069 
you can space these out so if you want
the<00:01:56.219> chairs<00:01:56.490> to<00:01:56.700> go<00:01:56.850> up<00:01:56.909> first<00:01:57.180> then<00:01:57.420> the<00:01:57.600> table

00:01:58.069 --> 00:01:58.079 
the chairs to go up first then the table

00:01:58.079 --> 00:02:00.350 
the chairs to go up first then the table
you<00:01:58.350> can<00:01:58.500> space<00:01:58.770> them<00:01:59.070> and<00:01:59.729> then<00:02:00.000> basically

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:00.360 
you can space them and then basically

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:05.240 
you can space them and then basically
sling<00:02:00.810> that<00:02:00.840> up<00:02:01.110> and<00:02:02.210> add<00:02:03.210> it<00:02:03.270> to<00:02:03.479> the<00:02:04.250> lever

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:05.250 
sling that up and add it to the lever

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:08.779 
sling that up and add it to the lever
and<00:02:05.969> when<00:02:06.119> you<00:02:06.210> flick<00:02:06.450> that<00:02:07.340> the<00:02:08.340> main<00:02:08.520> part

00:02:08.779 --> 00:02:08.789 
and when you flick that the main part

00:02:08.789 --> 00:02:11.300 
and when you flick that the main part
will<00:02:08.879> come<00:02:09.000> up<00:02:09.119> and<00:02:09.440> then<00:02:10.440> just<00:02:10.890> to<00:02:11.099> like

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:11.310 
will come up and then just to like

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:13.250 
will come up and then just to like
integrate<00:02:11.849> it<00:02:12.060> with<00:02:12.180> the<00:02:12.209> floor<00:02:12.540> or<00:02:12.660> something

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:13.260 
integrate it with the floor or something

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:15.550 
integrate it with the floor or something
let's<00:02:13.409> go<00:02:13.560> around<00:02:13.650> the<00:02:14.040> outside<00:02:14.190> once<00:02:14.670> more

00:02:15.550 --> 00:02:15.560 
let's go around the outside once more

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:19.130 
let's go around the outside once more
and<00:02:16.560> cover<00:02:16.800> over<00:02:17.220> so<00:02:17.549> just<00:02:17.879> clean<00:02:18.390> looking<00:02:18.870> so

00:02:19.130 --> 00:02:19.140 
and cover over so just clean looking so

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:23.030 
and cover over so just clean looking so
