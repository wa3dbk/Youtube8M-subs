go<00:00:38.520> first<00:00:39.059> to<00:00:39.329> tech<00:00:39.510> power<00:00:39.690> ups<00:00:39.930> gpu-z<00:00:40.620> alright

00:00:41.209 --> 00:00:41.219 
go first to tech power ups gpu-z alright

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:42.920 
go first to tech power ups gpu-z alright
now<00:00:41.820> go<00:00:42.090> to<00:00:42.149> the<00:00:42.360> first<00:00:42.570> tab<00:00:42.719> which<00:00:42.899> is

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:42.930 
now go to the first tab which is

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:44.630 
now go to the first tab which is

00:00:57.110 --> 00:00:57.120 
Nvidia video cards alright so this is

00:00:57.120 --> 00:00:58.639 
Nvidia video cards alright so this is
pretty<00:00:57.210> much<00:00:57.390> a<00:00:57.449> universal<00:00:57.780> overclocking

00:00:58.639 --> 00:00:58.649 
pretty much a universal overclocking

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:01.459 
pretty much a universal overclocking
guide<00:00:58.829> as<00:00:59.420> you<00:01:00.420> can<00:01:00.690> see<00:01:00.870> here<00:01:01.050> these<00:01:01.199> are<00:01:01.260> my

00:01:01.459 --> 00:01:01.469 
guide as you can see here these are my

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:02.900 
guide as you can see here these are my
default<00:01:01.800> clocks<00:01:02.070> and<00:01:02.280> you<00:01:02.340> can<00:01:02.489> see<00:01:02.670> already

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:02.910 
default clocks and you can see already

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:04.579 
default clocks and you can see already
that<00:01:03.030> I<00:01:03.210> already<00:01:03.660> overworked<00:01:04.080> locked<00:01:04.290> it<00:01:04.439> but

00:01:04.579 --> 00:01:04.589 
that I already overworked locked it but

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:05.690 
that I already overworked locked it but
I'll<00:01:04.650> show<00:01:04.830> you<00:01:04.890> step-by-step<00:01:05.280> how<00:01:05.610> to

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:05.700 
I'll show you step-by-step how to

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:08.179 
I'll show you step-by-step how to
overclock<00:01:06.030> it<00:01:06.210> later<00:01:06.360> so<00:01:06.680> go<00:01:07.680> to<00:01:07.740> the<00:01:07.890> sensors

00:01:08.179 --> 00:01:08.189 
overclock it later so go to the sensors

00:01:08.189 --> 00:01:09.590 
overclock it later so go to the sensors
tab<00:01:08.430> and<00:01:08.670> make<00:01:08.760> sure<00:01:08.820> that<00:01:09.119> everything<00:01:09.570> looks

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:09.600 
tab and make sure that everything looks

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:12.350 
tab and make sure that everything looks
normal<00:01:10.140> again<00:01:10.610> again<00:01:11.610> if<00:01:11.760> you're<00:01:11.939> running<00:01:12.119> in

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:12.360 
normal again again if you're running in

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:14.539 
normal again again if you're running in
standard<00:01:12.990> 2d<00:01:13.260> mode<00:01:13.439> which<00:01:13.650> means<00:01:13.890> it's<00:01:14.250> a<00:01:14.340> kind

00:01:14.539 --> 00:01:14.549 
standard 2d mode which means it's a kind

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:17.030 
standard 2d mode which means it's a kind
of<00:01:14.580> like<00:01:14.670> a<00:01:14.729> power<00:01:15.000> saving<00:01:15.479> mode<00:01:15.659> your<00:01:16.350> GPU

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:17.040 
of like a power saving mode your GPU

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:18.800 
of like a power saving mode your GPU
actually<00:01:17.460> underclock<00:01:17.850> itself<00:01:18.240> and<00:01:18.450> then<00:01:18.570> re

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:18.810 
actually underclock itself and then re

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:20.810 
actually underclock itself and then re
clock<00:01:19.170> itself<00:01:19.530> with<00:01:19.680> stock<00:01:19.979> speeds<00:01:20.310> as<00:01:20.549> soon

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:20.820 
clock itself with stock speeds as soon

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:23.090 
clock itself with stock speeds as soon
as<00:01:21.030> you<00:01:21.240> go<00:01:21.750> to<00:01:21.780> a<00:01:21.960> program<00:01:22.380> that<00:01:22.530> requires<00:01:22.860> it

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:23.100 
as you go to a program that requires it

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:25.850 
as you go to a program that requires it
to<00:01:23.130> stress<00:01:23.909> itself<00:01:24.210> alright<00:01:24.509> also<00:01:25.350> keep<00:01:25.770> an

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:25.860 
to stress itself alright also keep an

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:27.859 
to stress itself alright also keep an
eye<00:01:25.979> on<00:01:26.009> their<00:01:26.280> GPU<00:01:26.759> temperature<00:01:27.240> and<00:01:27.450> I'll

00:01:27.859 --> 00:01:27.869 
eye on their GPU temperature and I'll

00:01:27.869 --> 00:01:29.870 
eye on their GPU temperature and I'll
say<00:01:28.080> this<00:01:28.200> beforehand<00:01:28.799> that<00:01:29.040> newer<00:01:29.430> Nvidia

00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:29.880 
say this beforehand that newer Nvidia

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:31.850 
say this beforehand that newer Nvidia
cards<00:01:30.270> and<00:01:30.450> ATI<00:01:30.990> cards<00:01:31.409> have<00:01:31.560> something

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:31.860 
cards and ATI cards have something

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:33.590 
cards and ATI cards have something
called<00:01:32.040> the<00:01:32.189> thermal<00:01:32.400> throttling<00:01:32.820> throttling

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:33.600 
called the thermal throttling throttling

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:35.690 
called the thermal throttling throttling
which<00:01:34.110> will<00:01:34.320> mean<00:01:34.500> if<00:01:34.680> your<00:01:34.829> car<00:01:35.040> gets<00:01:35.250> too<00:01:35.490> hot

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:35.700 
which will mean if your car gets too hot

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:37.460 
which will mean if your car gets too hot
it'll<00:01:36.000> reset<00:01:36.360> itself<00:01:36.659> back<00:01:36.869> to<00:01:37.020> its<00:01:37.140> standard

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:37.470 
it'll reset itself back to its standard

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:39.950 
it'll reset itself back to its standard

normal clock that time so I'm going
first<00:03:08.400> to<00:03:09.329> the<00:03:09.450> core<00:03:09.659> clock<00:03:09.900> and<00:03:10.139> my<00:03:10.500> method<00:03:10.739> of

00:03:10.909 --> 00:03:10.919 
first to the core clock and my method of

00:03:10.919 --> 00:03:14.000 
first to the core clock and my method of
overclocking<00:03:11.310> is<00:03:12.019> increasing<00:03:13.019> the<00:03:13.230> better

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:14.010 
overclocking is increasing the better

00:03:14.010 --> 00:03:16.970 
overclocking is increasing the better
heard<00:03:14.280> for<00:03:15.030> the<00:03:15.120> core<00:03:15.299> clock<00:03:15.480> by<00:03:15.689> 5<00:03:16.109> increments

00:03:16.970 --> 00:03:16.980 
heard for the core clock by 5 increments

00:03:16.980 --> 00:03:19.939 
heard for the core clock by 5 increments
right<00:03:17.159> so<00:03:17.609> 1<00:03:17.819> 2<00:03:18.060> 3<00:03:18.299> 4<00:03:18.629> 5<00:03:18.840> now<00:03:19.470> what<00:03:19.650> you're<00:03:19.859> gonna

00:03:19.939 --> 00:03:19.949 
right so 1 2 3 4 5 now what you're gonna

00:03:19.949 --> 00:03:21.289 
right so 1 2 3 4 5 now what you're gonna
do<00:03:20.190> is<00:03:20.340> after<00:03:20.489> that<00:03:20.760> you're<00:03:20.940> gonna<00:03:21.030> click

00:03:21.289 --> 00:03:21.299 
do is after that you're gonna click

00:03:21.299 --> 00:03:23.599 
do is after that you're gonna click
apply<00:03:21.629> you're<00:03:22.349> gonna<00:03:22.500> go<00:03:22.739> back<00:03:22.949> to<00:03:23.010> firm<00:03:23.340> mark

00:03:23.599 --> 00:03:23.609 
apply you're gonna go back to firm mark

00:03:23.609 --> 00:03:25.520 
apply you're gonna go back to firm mark
look<00:03:24.150> at<00:03:24.269> the<00:03:24.389> image<00:03:24.629> very<00:03:24.930> closely<00:03:25.199> it<00:03:25.409> should

00:03:25.520 --> 00:03:25.530 
look at the image very closely it should

00:03:25.530 --> 00:03:28.039 
look at the image very closely it should
be<00:03:25.590> a<00:03:25.620> rotating<00:03:26.220> fur<00:03:26.639> ring<00:03:27.150> and<00:03:27.359> if<00:03:27.780> you<00:03:27.870> see

00:03:28.039 --> 00:03:28.049 
be a rotating fur ring and if you see

00:03:28.049 --> 00:03:30.050

right<00:04:50.900> so<00:04:51.320> when<00:04:51.890> that<00:04:51.950> happens<00:04:52.340> I'll<00:04:52.970> show<00:04:53.210> you

00:04:53.260 --> 00:04:53.270 
right so when that happens I'll show you

00:04:53.270 --> 00:04:54.040 
right so when that happens I'll show you
in<00:04:53.630> a<00:04:53.780> while

okay<00:04:54.290> so<00:04:54.560> shutter<00:04:55.100> o'clock<00:04:55.310> it's<00:04:55.580> a<00:04:55.610> big

00:04:55.780 --> 00:04:55.790

you increase it by five megahertz
