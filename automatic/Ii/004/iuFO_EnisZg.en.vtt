 hi friends from youtube i am that gas 5 and 

00:00:03.179 --> 00:00:09.330
 this is my first tutorial for 

00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:11.969
 download a new house for cj 

00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:14.460
 Well the first thing they have to do is 

00:00:11.969 --> 00:00:17.070
 download the al sisi m &amp; g editor and the 

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:19.290
 folder of the new house of cj les 

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:21.240
 I'll leave in the links in the description of 

00:00:19.290 --> 00:00:23.880
 video 

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:25.950
 once downloaded they go where 

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:29.160
 have saved in my case is in my 

00:00:25.950 --> 00:00:31.860
 documents and downloads 

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:34.290
 first let's put the boost on axis 

00:00:31.860 --> 00:00:37.830
 editor we give you right click and extract 

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:40.559
 here I recommend you create a folder 

00:00:37.830 --> 00:00:42.600
 to save the extracted files you 

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:44.790
 we right click on a space in 

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:48.360
 white and we put new folder 

00:00:44.790 --> 00:00:49.680
 we put the cis ing editor 1.5 or as 

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:51.449
 you want 

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:53.430
 then we select the files 

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:55.760
 extracted and drag them to the new 

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:55.760
 binder 

00:00:56.510 --> 00:01:03.070
 now we extract the new house from cj clic 

00:00:59.839 --> 00:01:03.070
 right and extract here 

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:12.320
 after having extracted the file 

00:01:09.979 --> 00:01:14.720
 we will see that we have this folder of the 

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:17.560
 new house these are the photos of how 

00:01:14.720 --> 00:01:17.560
 it will look after 

00:01:19.120 --> 00:01:23.970
 well now we open the al sisi amg 

00:01:21.610 --> 00:01:23.970
 editor 

00:01:24.010 --> 00:01:29.470
 once open they give a file and then a 

00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:32.050

00:01:29.470 --> 00:01:35.470

00:01:52.220 --> 00:01:58.280

00:01:55.070 --> 00:02:00.350
 means import remove if it exists and 

00:01:58.280 --> 00:02:04.220

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:07.340
