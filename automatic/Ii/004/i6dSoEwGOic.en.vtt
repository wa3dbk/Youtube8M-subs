talk<00:00:04.589> to<00:00:04.620> you<00:00:04.740> about<00:00:04.799> three<00:00:05.220> wheels<00:00:05.430> that<00:00:05.670> can

00:00:05.780 --> 00:00:05.790 
talk to you about three wheels that can

00:00:05.790 --> 00:00:07.700 
talk to you about three wheels that can
pretty<00:00:05.940> much<00:00:06.089> complete<00:00:06.420> any<00:00:06.600> quiver<00:00:06.899> we've

00:00:07.700 --> 00:00:07.710 
pretty much complete any quiver we've

00:00:07.710 --> 00:00:10.730 
pretty much complete any quiver we've
got<00:00:07.830> a<00:00:08.069> vac<00:00:08.790> 11<00:00:08.940> pink<00:00:09.389> polka-dots<00:00:09.870> pink<00:00:10.559> cow

00:00:10.730 --> 00:00:10.740 
got a vac 11 pink polka-dots pink cow

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:13.310 
got a vac 11 pink polka-dots pink cow
balls<00:00:11.010> and<00:00:11.490> I<00:00:11.550> think<00:00:11.759> seminars<00:00:12.210> from<00:00:13.170> the

00:00:13.310 --> 00:00:13.320 
balls and I think seminars from the

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:14.990 
balls and I think seminars from the
Pink's<00:00:13.559> formula<00:00:13.889> I've<00:00:14.040> got<00:00:14.190> the<00:00:14.280> 81<00:00:14.639> edge<00:00:14.790> your

00:00:14.990 --> 00:00:15.000 
Pink's formula I've got the 81 edge your

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.540 
Pink's formula I've got the 81 edge your
honors<00:00:15.240> which<00:00:15.450> happens<00:00:15.780> to<00:00:15.870> be<00:00:15.900> blue<00:00:16.550> it's

00:00:17.540 --> 00:00:17.550 
honors which happens to be blue it's

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:19.609 
honors which happens to be blue it's
just<00:00:17.699> a<00:00:17.760> new<00:00:17.880> formula<00:00:18.330> brought<00:00:18.510> outside<00:00:18.990> and

00:00:19.609 --> 00:00:19.619 
just a new formula brought outside and

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:21.019 
just a new formula brought outside and
have<00:00:19.740> a<00:00:19.830> good<00:00:19.920> look<00:00:20.039> around<00:00:20.160> today<00:00:20.430> and<00:00:20.460> ride

00:00:21.019 --> 00:00:21.029 
have a good look around today and ride

00:00:21.029 --> 00:01:32.350 
have a good look around today and ride
all<00:00:21.180> three<00:00:21.420> and<00:00:21.570> see<00:00:22.140> what<00:00:22.260> they're<00:00:22.380> good<00:00:22.500> for

00:01:32.350 --> 00:01:32.360 

00:01:32.360 --> 00:01:34.249 

so<00:01:33.360> I've<00:01:33.450> been<00:01:33.570> skating<00:01:33.780> for<00:01:33.899> a<00:01:33.990> couple<00:01:34.229> of

00:01:34.249 --> 00:01:34.259 
so I've been skating for a couple of

00:01:34.259 --> 00:01:36.289 
so I've been skating for a couple of
hours<00:01:34.320> now<00:01:34.590> ridden<00:01:34.890> all<00:01:35.009> three<00:01:35.250> wheels<00:01:35.430> riding

00:01:36.289 --> 00:01:36.299 
hours now ridden all three wheels riding

00:01:36.299 --> 00:01:38.179 
hours now ridden all three wheels riding
them<00:01:36.390> on<00:01:36.479> my<00:01:36.600> Jack<00:01:36.840> Cole<00:01:37.079> kick<00:01:37.320> with<00:01:37.619> some<00:01:37.770> 43

00:01:38.179 --> 00:01:38.189 
them on my Jack Cole kick with some 43

00:01:38.189 --> 00:01:41.270 
them on my Jack Cole kick with some 43
degree<00:01:38.549> rogue<00:01:38.850> precision<00:01:39.329> trucks<00:01:40.070> to<00:01:41.070> start

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:41.280 
degree rogue precision trucks to start

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:43.760 
degree rogue precision trucks to start
off<00:01:41.399> with<00:01:41.549> polka<00:01:41.909> dots<00:01:42.229> they<00:01:43.229> turn<00:01:43.439> out<00:01:43.530> to<00:01:43.649> be

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:43.770 
off with polka dots they turn out to be

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:45.380 
off with polka dots they turn out to be
a<00:01:43.799> really<00:01:44.100> awesome<00:01:44.670> for<00:01:44.789> yard<00:01:45.030> wheel<00:01:45.179> for

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:45.390 
a really awesome for yard wheel for

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:47.359 
a really awesome for yard wheel for
small<00:01:45.630> technical<00:01:46.049> hills<00:01:46.289> learning<00:01:47.220> these

00:01:47.359 --> 00:01:47.369 
small technical hills learning these

00:01:47.369 --> 00:01:49.520 
small technical hills learning these
slides<00:01:47.670> and<00:01:48.000> they're<00:01:48.689> super<00:01:49.020> easy<00:01:49.110> to<00:01:49.289> break

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:49.530 
slides and they're super easy to break

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:51.459 
slides and they're super easy to break
in<00:01:49.710> so<00:01:49.979> it's<00:01:50.460> really<00:01:50.759> just<00:01:50.880> what<00:01:51.060> you<00:01:51.179> want

00:01:51.459 --> 00:01:51.469 
in so it's really just what you want

00:01:51.469 --> 00:01:53.600 
in so it's really just what you want
only<00:01:52.469> downside<00:01:52.799> is<00:01:52.890> they<00:01:53.009> don't<00:01:53.159> last<00:01:53.369> too

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:53.610 
only downside is they don't last too

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:55.459 
only downside is they don't last too
long<00:01:53.640> but<00:01:54.030> they<00:01:54.659> are<00:01:54.750> Center<00:01:55.049> set<00:01:55.200> so<00:01:55.350> you<00:01:55.439> can

00:01:55.459 --> 00:01:55.469 
long but they are Center set so you can

00:01:55.469 --> 00:01:57.289 
long but they are Center set so you can
flip<00:01:56.039> them<00:01:56.189> get<00:01:56.640> them<00:01:56.759> wearing<00:01:56.909> nice<00:01:57.119> and

00:01:57.289 --> 00:01:57.299 
flip them get them wearing nice and

00:01:57.299 --> 00:01:58.550 
flip them get them wearing nice and
evenly<00:01:57.479> get<00:01:57.659> maximum<00:01:57.990> life<00:01:58.229> out<00:01:58.380> of<00:01:58.409> your

00:01:58.550 --> 00:01:58.560 
evenly get maximum life out of your

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:00.770 
evenly get maximum life out of your
wheel<00:01:58.679> step<00:01:59.640> it<00:01:59.759> up<00:01:59.819> to<00:01:59.880> the<00:02:00.030> power<00:02:00.270> balls<00:02:00.539> a

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:00.780 
wheel step it up to the power balls a

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:02.570 
wheel step it up to the power balls a
little<00:02:01.140> bit<00:02:01.229> harder<00:02:01.439> to<00:02:01.530> break<00:02:01.679> in<00:02:01.890> but<00:02:02.159> still

00:02:02.570 --> 00:02:02.580 
little bit harder to break in but still

00:02:02.580 --> 00:02:04.279 
little bit harder to break in but still
worth<00:02:02.759> it<00:02:02.939> because<00:02:03.119> a<00:02:03.270> little<00:02:03.810> bit<00:02:04.049> longer

00:02:04.279 --> 00:02:04.289 
worth it because a little bit longer

00:02:04.289 --> 00:02:06.980 
worth it because a little bit longer
lasting<00:02:04.700> you<00:02:05.700> go<00:02:05.849> lot<00:02:06.329> faster<00:02:06.750> on<00:02:06.840> them<00:02:06.929> would

00:02:06.980 --> 00:02:06.990 
lasting you go lot faster on them would

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:08.479 
lasting you go lot faster on them would
be<00:02:07.110> quite<00:02:07.319> comfortable<00:02:07.560> without<00:02:07.920> sliding<00:02:08.340> out

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:08.489 
be quite comfortable without sliding out

00:02:08.489 --> 00:02:11.509 
be quite comfortable without sliding out
and<00:02:09.349> yeah<00:02:10.349> they<00:02:10.560> dump<00:02:10.829> fain<00:02:11.069> as<00:02:11.220> well<00:02:11.370> so

00:02:11.509 --> 00:02:11.519 
and yeah they dump fain as well so

00:02:11.519 --> 00:02:13.009 
and yeah they dump fain as well so
that's<00:02:11.670> a<00:02:11.730> plus<00:02:12.000> Sam<00:02:12.510> with<00:02:12.660> the<00:02:12.720> polka<00:02:12.930> dots

00:02:13.009 --> 00:02:13.019 
that's a plus Sam with the polka dots

00:02:13.019 --> 00:02:15.650 
that's a plus Sam with the polka dots
the<00:02:13.980> seven<00:02:14.310> is<00:02:14.459> really<00:02:15.120> far<00:02:15.360> from<00:02:15.510> what<00:02:15.630> I

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:15.660 
the seven is really far from what I

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:18.110 
the seven is really far from what I
expected<00:02:16.040> they<00:02:17.040> are<00:02:17.310> really<00:02:17.579> quite<00:02:17.670> grippy

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:18.120 
expected they are really quite grippy

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:19.699 
expected they are really quite grippy
wheel<00:02:18.269> they<00:02:18.750> were<00:02:18.930> originally<00:02:19.319> intended<00:02:19.530> for

00:02:19.699 --> 00:02:19.709 
wheel they were originally intended for

00:02:19.709 --> 00:02:21.620 
wheel they were originally intended for
slalom<00:02:20.010> I'm<00:02:20.220> pretty<00:02:20.400> sure<00:02:20.579> so<00:02:20.880> that's

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:21.630 
slalom I'm pretty sure so that's

00:02:21.630 --> 00:02:22.610 
slalom I'm pretty sure so that's
probably<00:02:21.840> where<00:02:22.019> that<00:02:22.140> comes<00:02:22.349> from

00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:22.620 
probably where that comes from

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:25.250 
probably where that comes from
I've<00:02:23.579> done<00:02:23.910> six<00:02:24.269> slides<00:02:24.510> in<00:02:24.690> them<00:02:24.780> already<00:02:24.930> and

00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:25.260 
I've done six slides in them already and

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:27.050 
I've done six slides in them already and
they've<00:02:25.500> still<00:02:25.860> got<00:02:26.069> some<00:02:26.310> old<00:02:26.430> early<00:02:26.670> skin<00:02:26.940> on

00:02:27.050 --> 00:02:27.060 
they've still got some old early skin on

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:28.940 
they've still got some old early skin on
there<00:02:27.209> so<00:02:27.480> if<00:02:27.989> you're<00:02:28.170> looking<00:02:28.290> for<00:02:28.560> a<00:02:28.650> little

00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:28.950 
there so if you're looking for a little

00:02:28.950 --> 00:02:31.130 
there so if you're looking for a little
bit<00:02:29.040> of<00:02:29.099> a<00:02:29.160> race<00:02:29.340> wheel<00:02:29.579> for<00:02:30.000> a<00:02:30.030> smaller<00:02:30.569> top

00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:31.140 
bit of a race wheel for a smaller top

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:32.930 
bit of a race wheel for a smaller top
mount<00:02:31.349> with<00:02:31.500> a<00:02:31.530> low<00:02:31.680> clearance<00:02:31.980> set<00:02:32.250> up<00:02:32.400> this

00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:32.940 
mount with a low clearance set up this

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:34.910 
mount with a low clearance set up this
could<00:02:33.180> be<00:02:33.299> a<00:02:33.329> pretty<00:02:33.540> good<00:02:33.630> wheel<00:02:33.900> for<00:02:34.170> you

00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:34.920 
could be a pretty good wheel for you

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:37.280 
could be a pretty good wheel for you
all<00:02:35.549> these<00:02:35.730> wheels<00:02:36.000> are<00:02:36.209> available<00:02:36.720> in<00:02:36.840> the

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:37.290 
all these wheels are available in the

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:39.890 
all these wheels are available in the
pinks<00:02:38.190> formula<00:02:38.609> in<00:02:38.760> a<00:02:38.850> 78<00:02:39.239> a<00:02:39.269> gyrometer<00:02:39.660> which

00:02:39.890 --> 00:02:39.900 
pinks formula in a 78 a gyrometer which

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:42.259 
pinks formula in a 78 a gyrometer which
is<00:02:40.019> actually<00:02:40.440> pink<00:02:40.650> so<00:02:41.459> they're<00:02:41.819> all<00:02:41.940> a<00:02:41.970> bit

00:02:42.259 --> 00:02:42.269 
is actually pink so they're all a bit
