00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:39.059
 package series that is using the 

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:41.610
 simply support series package 

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:43.829
 because I will try to say we do something 

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:46.890
 so good to help a little 

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:50.399
 group then as enemies are already 

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:57.629
 behind my back to stop now 

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:59.219
 also good to the good and while instead 

00:00:57.629 --> 00:01:01.920
 the specialties I'm using are 

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:06.180

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:08.970

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:14.900
 come on if ok but waited according to that 

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:14.900
 I'm a little in trouble 

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:27.539
 so now we try almost every step 

00:01:23.539 --> 00:01:31.670
 or they will be as good as they are 

00:01:27.539 --> 00:01:31.670
 go off 

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:38.890
 ok 

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:46.990
 but where it is going this was not in 

00:01:43.219 --> 00:01:51.920
 top I knew I had to be careful 

00:01:46.990 --> 00:01:56.539
 roberta as there are when that is not 

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:59.929

00:01:56.539 --> 00:02:03.409
 crafted but fired up in test ok raga 

00:01:59.929 --> 00:02:05.799
 do not use it craft explosive e 

00:02:03.409 --> 00:02:10.099
 we say causes of many but it is not that 

00:02:05.799 --> 00:02:11.840
 the players pull then there are many 

00:02:10.099 --> 00:02:14.510
 other reasons but the artisanal explosive 

00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:19.340
 I think it's one of the first 

00:02:14.510 --> 00:02:25.269
 oh no no a risk will be a coincidence 

00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:25.269
 still ok 

00:02:29.230 --> 00:02:38.049
 but then responds suspected second 

00:02:34.349 --> 00:02:43.450

00:02:53.129 --> 00:03:00.489

00:02:57.459 --> 00:03:02.140
 that I don't have a magic trick for you 

00:03:00.489 --> 00:03:03.730
 should call it that now those 

00:03:02.140 --> 00:03:04.890

00:03:03.730 --> 00:03:08.739

00:03:31.349 --> 00:03:34.349

00:03:46.319 --> 00:03:51.090

00:04:09.470 --> 00:04:12.840

00:04:15.810 --> 00:04:22.169

00:04:18.630 --> 00:04:30.560

00:04:22.169 --> 00:04:30.560

00:04:34.550 --> 00:04:40.850

00:04:36.830 --> 00:04:41.660

00:04:40.850 --> 00:04:46.880

00:05:18.080 --> 00:05:24.140
