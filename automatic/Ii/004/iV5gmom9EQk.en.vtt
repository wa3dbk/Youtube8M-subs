00:05:11.389 --> 00:05:11.399 
different style of play when cats hunt

00:05:11.399 --> 00:05:13.849 
different style of play when cats hunt
they<00:05:11.639> stalk<00:05:11.999> wait<00:05:12.689> and<00:05:13.049> analyze<00:05:13.499> and<00:05:13.799> then

00:05:13.849 --> 00:05:13.859 
they stalk wait and analyze and then

00:05:13.859 --> 00:05:15.009 
they stalk wait and analyze and then
pounce

00:05:15.009 --> 00:05:15.019 
pounce

00:05:15.019 --> 00:05:17.809 
pounce
this<00:05:16.019> tactic<00:05:16.469> revolves<00:05:17.069> around<00:05:17.159> the<00:05:17.429> idea<00:05:17.759> of

00:05:17.809 --> 00:05:17.819 
this tactic revolves around the idea of

00:05:17.819 --> 00:05:19.909 
this tactic revolves around the idea of
engaging<00:05:18.329> into<00:05:18.809> the<00:05:18.929> fight<00:05:19.139> on<00:05:19.379> your<00:05:19.619> terms

00:05:19.909 --> 00:05:19.919 
engaging into the fight on your terms

00:05:19.919 --> 00:05:22.099 
engaging into the fight on your terms
when<00:05:20.819> you're<00:05:20.969> ready<00:05:21.179> and<00:05:21.389> you<00:05:21.749> know<00:05:21.869> that<00:05:22.049> you

00:05:22.099 --> 00:05:22.109 
when you're ready and you know that you

00:05:22.109 --> 00:05:24.379 
when you're ready and you know that you
have<00:05:22.289> the<00:05:22.439> advantage<00:05:22.849> so<00:05:23.849> fighting<00:05:24.089> in<00:05:24.299> this

00:05:24.379 --> 00:05:24.389 
have the advantage so fighting in this

00:05:24.389 --> 00:05:25.849 
have the advantage so fighting in this
style<00:05:24.689> requires<00:05:25.079> more<00:05:25.319> patience<00:05:25.799> and

planning rather than being impulsive and
aggressive<00:05:27.989> I<00:05:28.669> believe<00:05:29.669> that<00:05:29.849> there<00:05:29.969> are

aggressive I believe that there are

00:05:29.999 --> 00:05:31.639 
aggressive I believe that there are
three<00:05:30.209> main<00:05:30.449> techniques<00:05:30.659> required<00:05:31.319> to<00:05:31.469> master

00:05:31.639 --> 00:05:31.649 
three main techniques required to master

three main techniques required to master
a<00:05:32.069> play<00:05:32.819> in<00:05:32.879> this<00:05:33.029> manner<00:05:33.619> the<00:05:34.619> first

00:05:34.879 --> 00:05:34.889 
a play in this manner the first

00:05:34.889 --> 00:05:36.679 
a play in this manner the first
technique<00:05:35.249> is<00:05:35.399> to<00:05:35.639> learn<00:05:35.759> to<00:05:35.819> hang<00:05:36.089> back<00:05:36.329> and

00:05:36.679 --> 00:05:36.689 
technique is to learn to hang back and

00:05:36.689 --> 00:05:39.049 
technique is to learn to hang back and
keep<00:05:36.989> distance<00:05:37.229> from<00:05:37.469> your<00:05:37.679> enemies<00:05:38.009> try<00:05:38.999> to

00:05:39.049 --> 00:05:39.059 
keep distance from your enemies try to

00:05:39.059 --> 00:05:40.579 
keep distance from your enemies try to
be<00:05:39.239> far<00:05:39.479> out<00:05:39.659> enough<00:05:39.989> so<00:05:40.019> that<00:05:40.319> you're<00:05:40.409> not<00:05:40.529> a

be far out enough so that you're not a

be far out enough so that you're not a
primary<00:05:41.069> target<00:05:41.309> but<00:05:42.179> not<00:05:42.360> too<00:05:42.569> far<00:05:42.779> away<00:05:43.019> that

00:05:43.159 --> 00:05:43.169 
primary target but not too far away that

00:05:43.169 --> 00:05:44.779 
primary target but not too far away that
you're<00:05:43.289> effectively<00:05:43.709> not<00:05:43.949> in<00:05:44.099> the<00:05:44.159> battle<00:05:44.339> you

00:05:46.789 --> 00:05:46.799 
still need to be able to pounce when

00:05:46.799 --> 00:05:48.379 
still need to be able to pounce when
you're<00:05:46.889> ready<00:05:47.069> and<00:05:47.309> you<00:05:47.579> can't<00:05:47.819> do<00:05:47.999> that<00:05:48.149> if<00:05:48.269> it

00:05:48.379 --> 00:05:48.389 
you're ready and you can't do that if it

00:05:48.389 --> 00:05:50.089 
you're ready and you can't do that if it
takes<00:05:48.599> 30<00:05:48.869> plus<00:05:49.199> seconds<00:05:49.679> to<00:05:49.769> reach<00:05:49.949> your

takes 30 plus seconds to reach your
target<00:05:50.779> the<00:05:51.779> second<00:05:52.199> tactic<00:05:52.529> is<00:05:52.769> to<00:05:53.009> learn<00:05:53.159> to

00:05:53.389 --> 00:05:53.399 
target the second tactic is to learn to

00:05:53.399 --> 00:05:54.789 
target the second tactic is to learn to
use<00:05:53.579> the<00:05:53.729> environment<00:05:53.969> to<00:05:54.239> suit<00:05:54.509> you

00:05:54.789 --> 00:05:54.799

structures in the middle and it's very
possible<00:06:05.639> to<00:06:05.699> use<00:06:05.999> these<00:06:06.179> structures<00:06:06.659> and

00:06:06.859 --> 00:06:06.869 
possible to use these structures and

00:06:06.869 --> 00:06:09.289 
possible to use these structures and
rocks<00:06:07.169> as<00:06:07.379> barriers<00:06:07.799> by<00:06:08.519> putting<00:06:08.849> physical

rocks as barriers by putting physical
obstacles<00:06:09.779> between<00:06:09.959> you<00:06:10.259> and<00:06:10.409> the<00:06:10.469> enemy<00:06:10.619> it's

00:06:11.269 --> 00:06:11.279 
obstacles between you and the enemy it's

00:06:11.279 --> 00:06:13.099 
obstacles between you and the enemy it's
possible<00:06:11.759> to<00:06:11.849> manipulate<00:06:11.969> the<00:06:12.329> battle<00:06:12.749> so

00:06:13.099 --> 00:06:13.109 
possible to manipulate the battle so

00:06:13.109 --> 00:06:14.419 
possible to manipulate the battle so
that<00:06:13.229> you<00:06:13.289> don't<00:06:13.439> get<00:06:13.529> swarmed<00:06:13.829> by<00:06:13.949> enemies

00:06:14.419 --> 00:06:14.429 
that you don't get swarmed by enemies

00:06:14.429 --> 00:06:16.659 
that you don't get swarmed by enemies
and<00:06:14.699> you<00:06:14.849> can<00:06:14.999> pounce<00:06:15.239> on<00:06:15.389> them<00:06:15.539> one<00:06:15.689> at<00:06:15.809> a<00:06:15.869> time

00:06:16.659 --> 00:06:16.669 
and you can pounce on them one at a time

00:06:16.669 --> 00:06:19.249 
and you can pounce on them one at a time
use<00:06:17.669> obstacles<00:06:18.269> to<00:06:18.509> shield<00:06:18.779> yourself<00:06:18.989> from

00:06:19.249 --> 00:06:19.259 
use obstacles to shield yourself from

00:06:19.259 --> 00:06:21.589 
use obstacles to shield yourself from
incoming<00:06:19.739> fire<00:06:19.979> and<00:06:20.309> also<00:06:20.969> use<00:06:21.209> them<00:06:21.449> to

00:06:21.589 --> 00:06:21.599 
incoming fire and also use them to

00:06:21.599 --> 00:06:23.419 
incoming fire and also use them to
escape<00:06:21.989> from<00:06:22.109> the<00:06:22.289> fight<00:06:22.499> by<00:06:22.919> doing<00:06:23.189> tight

00:06:23.419 --> 00:06:23.429 
escape from the fight by doing tight

00:06:23.429 --> 00:06:25.039 
escape from the fight by doing tight
maneuvers<00:06:23.879> around<00:06:24.179> them<00:06:24.359> so<00:06:24.689> that<00:06:24.809> you<00:06:24.899> can

00:06:25.039 --> 00:06:25.049 
maneuvers around them so that you can

00:06:25.049 --> 00:06:27.069 
maneuvers around them so that you can
return<00:06:25.199> to<00:06:25.559> pounce<00:06:25.829> again<00:06:26.009> when<00:06:26.309> ready

00:06:27.069 --> 00:06:27.079 
return to pounce again when ready

00:06:27.079 --> 00:06:29.959 
return to pounce again when ready
finally<00:06:28.079> the<00:06:28.739> third<00:06:29.009> technique<00:06:29.279> is<00:06:29.639> to<00:06:29.849> learn

00:06:29.959 --> 00:06:29.969 
finally the third technique is to learn

00:06:29.969 --> 00:06:32.419 
finally the third technique is to learn
to<00:06:30.029> pick<00:06:30.419> the<00:06:30.599> right<00:06:30.779> targets<00:06:31.319> you<00:06:32.099> want<00:06:32.129> to

00:06:32.419 --> 00:06:32.429 
to pick the right targets you want to

00:06:32.429 --> 00:06:33.399 
to pick the right targets you want to
attack<00:06:32.729> someone

00:06:33.399 --> 00:06:33.409 
attack someone

00:06:33.409 --> 00:06:35.499 
attack someone
vulnerable<00:06:34.009> as<00:06:34.189> possible<00:06:34.669> so<00:06:34.969> the<00:06:35.089> odds<00:06:35.300> are

00:06:35.499 --> 00:06:35.509 
vulnerable as possible so the odds are

00:06:35.509 --> 00:06:37.179 
vulnerable as possible so the odds are
as<00:06:35.689> much<00:06:35.929> in<00:06:36.080> your<00:06:36.169> favor<00:06:36.469> as<00:06:36.709> they<00:06:36.860> can<00:06:37.039> be

00:06:37.179 --> 00:06:37.189 
as much in your favor as they can be

00:06:37.189 --> 00:06:40.119 
as much in your favor as they can be
when<00:06:38.059> searching<00:06:38.539> for<00:06:38.659> targets<00:06:38.949> look<00:06:39.949> for

00:06:40.119 --> 00:06:40.129 
when searching for targets look for

00:06:40.129 --> 00:06:42.699 
when searching for targets look for
those<00:06:40.279> separated<00:06:40.580> from<00:06:40.999> the<00:06:41.119> main<00:06:41.269> group<00:06:41.709> look

00:06:42.699 --> 00:06:42.709 
those separated from the main group look

00:06:42.709 --> 00:06:44.169 
those separated from the main group look
for<00:06:42.889> those<00:06:43.039> already<00:06:43.309> in<00:06:43.580> a<00:06:43.639> fights<00:06:43.969> that

00:06:44.169 --> 00:06:44.179 
for those already in a fights that

00:06:44.179 --> 00:06:45.850 
for those already in a fights that
unable<00:06:44.449> to<00:06:44.629> maneuver<00:06:44.839> against<00:06:45.439> your<00:06:45.559> attacks

00:06:45.850 --> 00:06:45.860 
unable to maneuver against your attacks

00:06:45.860 --> 00:06:48.369 
unable to maneuver against your attacks
and<00:06:46.239> finally<00:06:47.239> look<00:06:47.779> for<00:06:47.959> those<00:06:48.080> who<00:06:48.289> are

00:06:48.369 --> 00:06:48.379 
and finally look for those who are

00:06:48.379 --> 00:06:50.409 
and finally look for those who are
damaged<00:06:48.830> and<00:06:48.979> only<00:06:49.369> require<00:06:49.699> a<00:06:49.729> few<00:06:49.879> shots<00:06:50.300> to

00:07:01.359 --> 00:07:01.369 
would consider ganking and cowardly

00:07:01.369 --> 00:07:04.059 
would consider ganking and cowardly
however<00:07:02.179> it<00:07:02.389> works<00:07:02.569> and<00:07:02.959> war<00:07:03.199> is<00:07:03.349> never<00:07:03.499> fair<00:07:03.830> a

00:07:06.189 --> 00:07:06.199 
good pilot will not underestimate the

good pilot will not underestimate the
dogfighting<00:07:06.619> equivalent<00:07:07.219> of<00:07:07.369> a<00:07:07.429> club<00:07:07.699> to<00:07:07.819> the

00:07:07.899 --> 00:07:07.909 
dogfighting equivalent of a club to the

00:07:07.909 --> 00:07:09.159 
dogfighting equivalent of a club to the
back<00:07:08.059> of<00:07:08.179> the<00:07:08.269> head<00:07:08.419> when<00:07:08.689> the<00:07:08.779> stakes<00:07:08.989> are

00:07:09.159 --> 00:07:09.169 
back of the head when the stakes are

00:07:09.169 --> 00:07:12.189 
back of the head when the stakes are
high<00:07:09.639> so<00:07:10.639> that's<00:07:10.789> a<00:07:10.909> broad<00:07:11.149> introduction<00:07:11.599> into

00:07:12.189 --> 00:07:12.199 
high so that's a broad introduction into

00:07:12.199 --> 00:07:14.019 
high so that's a broad introduction into
the<00:07:12.289> two<00:07:12.499> main<00:07:12.709> fighting<00:07:13.009> styles<00:07:13.489> I<00:07:13.639> think

00:07:14.019 --> 00:07:14.029 
the two main fighting styles I think

00:07:14.029 --> 00:07:15.909 
the two main fighting styles I think
that<00:07:14.179> currently<00:07:14.539> existed<00:07:15.019> arena<00:07:15.289> commander<00:07:15.409> I

00:07:15.909 --> 00:07:15.919 
that currently existed arena commander I

00:07:15.919 --> 00:07:18.040 
that currently existed arena commander I
know<00:07:16.369> this<00:07:16.669> is<00:07:16.789> a<00:07:16.819> very<00:07:17.029> subjective<00:07:17.239> topic<00:07:17.659> so

00:07:18.040 --> 00:07:18.050 
know this is a very subjective topic so

00:07:18.050 --> 00:07:19.239 
know this is a very subjective topic so
I'll<00:07:18.110> be<00:07:18.229> looking<00:07:18.499> forward<00:07:18.739> to<00:07:18.889> hearing<00:07:19.129> what

00:07:19.239 --> 00:07:19.249

00:07:19.249 --> 00:07:21.279 
I'll be looking forward to hearing what
