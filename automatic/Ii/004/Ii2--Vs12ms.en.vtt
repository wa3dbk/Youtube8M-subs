we're<00:03:00.690> doing<00:03:00.959> heroic<00:03:01.350> foundry<00:03:01.709> now<00:03:01.860> we've

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:02.010 
we're doing heroic foundry now we've

00:03:02.010 --> 00:03:03.500 
we're doing heroic foundry now we've
cleared<00:03:02.250> normal<00:03:02.580> and<00:03:02.760> we<00:03:02.940> are<00:03:03.060> into<00:03:03.330> her<00:03:03.480> o

clock<00:03:03.780> Rock<00:03:03.900> boundary<00:03:04.230> and<00:03:04.410> I<00:03:05.400> think<00:03:05.730> it<00:03:05.790> would

00:03:05.870 --> 00:03:05.880 
clock Rock boundary and I think it would

00:03:05.880 --> 00:03:07.009 
clock Rock boundary and I think it would
be<00:03:05.910> fun<00:03:06.090> to<00:03:06.150> stream<00:03:06.420> those<00:03:06.600> I<00:03:06.720> wouldn't<00:03:06.959> be

00:03:07.009 --> 00:03:07.019 
be fun to stream those I wouldn't be

00:03:07.019 --> 00:03:08.449 
be fun to stream those I wouldn't be
able<00:03:07.110> to<00:03:07.230> be<00:03:07.350> super<00:03:07.680> chatty<00:03:07.920> because

00:03:08.449 --> 00:03:08.459 
able to be super chatty because

00:03:08.459 --> 00:03:09.890 
able to be super chatty because
obviously<00:03:08.760> I've<00:03:09.060> got<00:03:09.209> to<00:03:09.300> pay<00:03:09.390> attention<00:03:09.420> to

00:03:09.890 --> 00:03:09.900 
obviously I've got to pay attention to

00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:12.590

00:03:20.930 --> 00:03:20.940 
do think once i figure that out and get

00:03:20.940 --> 00:03:22.039 
do think once i figure that out and get
it<00:03:21.030> set<00:03:21.120> up<00:03:21.180> it<00:03:21.329> would<00:03:21.420> be<00:03:21.480> kind<00:03:21.630> of<00:03:21.690> cool<00:03:21.840> I

00:03:22.039 --> 00:03:22.049 
it set up it would be kind of cool I

00:03:22.049 --> 00:03:23.990 
it set up it would be kind of cool I
wouldn't<00:03:22.920> be<00:03:23.010> a<00:03:23.040> super<00:03:23.340> interactive<00:03:23.790> stream

00:03:23.990 --> 00:03:24.000 
wouldn't be a super interactive stream

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:25.640 
wouldn't be a super interactive stream
but<00:03:24.150> it<00:03:24.239> would<00:03:24.360> be<00:03:24.510> another<00:03:25.110> six<00:03:25.410> hours<00:03:25.500> of

00:03:25.640 --> 00:03:25.650 
but it would be another six hours of

00:03:25.650 --> 00:03:26.770 
but it would be another six hours of
streaming<00:03:25.920> in<00:03:26.070> the<00:03:26.130> week<00:03:26.280> because<00:03:26.459> we<00:03:26.579> do

00:05:33.090 --> 00:05:33.100 
or not I don't think your pets are being

00:05:33.100 --> 00:05:34.110 
or not I don't think your pets are being
nerfed<00:05:33.250> I<00:05:33.400> haven't<00:05:33.640> gone<00:05:33.760> through<00:05:33.880> every

00:05:34.110 --> 00:05:34.120 
nerfed I haven't gone through every

00:05:34.120 --> 00:05:35.670 
nerfed I haven't gone through every
single<00:05:34.420> one<00:05:34.600> to<00:05:34.840> check<00:05:35.170> and<00:05:35.380> see<00:05:35.440> what<00:05:35.590> the

00:05:35.670 --> 00:05:35.680 
single one to check and see what the

00:05:35.680 --> 00:05:36.930 
single one to check and see what the
abilities<00:05:36.040> are<00:05:36.130> there<00:05:36.250> may<00:05:36.400> be<00:05:36.430> some<00:05:36.790> balance

00:05:36.930 --> 00:05:36.940 
abilities are there may be some balance

00:05:36.940 --> 00:05:38.250 
abilities are there may be some balance
but<00:05:37.360> honestly<00:05:37.690> I<00:05:37.750> think<00:05:37.960> they<00:05:38.020> might<00:05:38.170> have

00:05:38.250 --> 00:05:38.260 
but honestly I think they might have

00:05:38.260 --> 00:05:40.740 
but honestly I think they might have
forgotten<00:05:38.500> about<00:05:38.740> that<00:05:38.800> so<00:05:39.400> huh<00:05:39.610> we'll<00:05:40.540> see

00:05:40.740 --> 00:05:40.750 
forgotten about that so huh we'll see

00:05:40.750 --> 00:05:43.350 
forgotten about that so huh we'll see
but<00:05:41.220> minor<00:05:42.220> nerf<00:05:42.430> to<00:05:42.550> the<00:05:42.670> dailies<00:05:42.940> but<00:05:43.090> the

00:05:46.170 --> 00:05:46.180 
just going to make it a little bit
