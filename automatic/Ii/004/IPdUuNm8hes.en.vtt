okay<00:00:03.969> this<00:00:04.210> is<00:00:04.420> the<00:00:04.660> motor<00:00:05.050> came<00:00:05.800> out<00:00:05.920> of<00:00:06.010> the

00:00:06.059 --> 00:00:06.069 
okay this is the motor came out of the

00:00:06.069 --> 00:00:07.860 
okay this is the motor came out of the
driver's<00:00:06.460> side

00:00:07.860 --> 00:00:07.870 
driver's side

00:00:07.870 --> 00:00:12.329 
driver's side
I<00:00:09.660> bought<00:00:10.660> this<00:00:10.839> cable<00:00:11.169> from<00:00:11.290> Home<00:00:11.469> Depot<00:00:11.500> it's

00:00:12.329 --> 00:00:12.339 
I bought this cable from Home Depot it's

00:00:12.339 --> 00:00:17.700 
I bought this cable from Home Depot it's
one<00:00:12.610> sixteenth<00:00:13.150> coated<00:00:13.709> green<00:00:14.709> and<00:00:16.619> it's<00:00:17.619> a

00:00:17.700 --> 00:00:17.710 
one sixteenth coated green and it's a

00:00:17.710 --> 00:00:19.290 
one sixteenth coated green and it's a
little<00:00:17.890> bit<00:00:18.039> more<00:00:18.220> flexible<00:00:18.670> than<00:00:18.790> the<00:00:18.910> cable

00:00:19.290 --> 00:00:19.300 
little bit more flexible than the cable

00:00:19.300 --> 00:00:22.080 
little bit more flexible than the cable
cable<00:00:19.570> that<00:00:19.810> came<00:00:20.020> off<00:00:20.290> this<00:00:20.830> motor<00:00:21.160> but<00:00:21.520> still

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:22.090 
cable that came off this motor but still

00:00:22.090 --> 00:00:25.980 
cable that came off this motor but still
work<00:00:22.360> so<00:00:23.400> one<00:00:24.400> thing<00:00:25.240> like<00:00:25.360> I<00:00:25.510> said<00:00:25.780> it's

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:25.990 
work so one thing like I said it's

00:00:25.990 --> 00:00:29.550 
work so one thing like I said it's
important<00:00:26.440> to<00:00:26.500> note<00:00:26.680> is<00:00:27.510> the<00:00:28.510> measurements<00:00:29.350> of

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:29.560 
important to note is the measurements of

00:00:29.560 --> 00:00:31.770 
important to note is the measurements of
the<00:00:29.710> cables<00:00:30.040> that<00:00:30.160> came<00:00:30.340> out<00:00:30.550> the<00:00:30.850> rear<00:00:31.270> cable

00:00:31.770 --> 00:00:31.780 
the cables that came out the rear cable

00:00:31.780 --> 00:00:35.579 
the cables that came out the rear cable
is<00:00:32.349> six<00:00:32.770> foot<00:00:32.980> nine<00:00:33.010> and<00:00:33.719> the<00:00:34.719> front<00:00:35.019> cable<00:00:35.499> the

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:35.589 
is six foot nine and the front cable the

00:00:35.589 --> 00:00:37.229 
is six foot nine and the front cable the
one<00:00:35.620> that<00:00:35.859> closes<00:00:36.129> the<00:00:36.370> door<00:00:36.609> is<00:00:36.760> five<00:00:37.030> feet

00:00:37.229 --> 00:00:37.239 
one that closes the door is five feet

00:00:37.239 --> 00:00:40.829 
one that closes the door is five feet
one<00:00:37.539> and<00:00:38.670> what<00:00:39.670> I<00:00:39.699> showed<00:00:40.449> you<00:00:40.659> in<00:00:40.749> the<00:00:40.780> other

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:40.839 
one and what I showed you in the other

00:00:40.839 --> 00:00:44.970 
one and what I showed you in the other
video<00:00:41.230> was<00:00:41.730> when<00:00:42.730> the<00:00:42.820> door<00:00:42.999> is<00:00:43.149> open<00:00:43.510> from<00:00:44.469> the

00:00:44.970 --> 00:00:44.980 
video was when the door is open from the

00:00:44.980 --> 00:00:47.669 
video was when the door is open from the
end<00:00:45.129> of<00:00:45.190> the<00:00:45.309> cable<00:00:45.760> to<00:00:46.170> this<00:00:47.170> point<00:00:47.469> is

00:00:47.669 --> 00:00:47.679 
end of the cable to this point is

00:00:47.679 --> 00:00:50.119 
end of the cable to this point is
roughly<00:00:48.010> nine<00:00:48.190> inches<00:00:48.519> so<00:00:48.789> what<00:00:49.120> I<00:00:49.149> did<00:00:49.239> was<00:00:49.539> I

00:00:50.119 --> 00:00:50.129 
roughly nine inches so what I did was I

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:52.649 
roughly nine inches so what I did was I
measured<00:00:51.129> this<00:00:51.219> nine<00:00:51.460> inches<00:00:51.850> so<00:00:52.329> that<00:00:52.480> means

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:52.659 
measured this nine inches so that means

00:00:52.659 --> 00:00:54.899 
measured this nine inches so that means
that<00:00:52.839> the<00:00:53.559> other<00:00:53.710> cable<00:00:53.979> has<00:00:54.280> to<00:00:54.460> be<00:00:54.609> more<00:00:54.850> or

00:00:54.899 --> 00:00:54.909 
that the other cable has to be more or

00:00:54.909 --> 00:00:59.969 
that the other cable has to be more or
less<00:00:54.940> close<00:00:56.249> and<00:00:57.659> I<00:00:58.659> routed<00:00:58.929> that<00:00:59.229> around<00:00:59.649> the

00:00:59.969 --> 00:00:59.979 
less close and I routed that around the

00:00:59.979 --> 00:01:06.120 
less close and I routed that around the
cable<00:01:01.229> properly<00:01:03.269> once<00:01:04.269> that's<00:01:04.510> routed<00:01:05.130> the

00:01:06.120 --> 00:01:06.130 
cable properly once that's routed the

00:01:06.130 --> 00:01:08.969 
cable properly once that's routed the
other<00:01:06.310> cable<00:01:06.610> you<00:01:07.030> just<00:01:07.619> ride<00:01:08.619> around<00:01:08.740> the

00:01:08.969 --> 00:01:08.979 
other cable you just ride around the

00:01:08.979 --> 00:01:10.530 
other cable you just ride around the
inner<00:01:09.130> pulley<00:01:09.460> and<00:01:09.670> don't<00:01:10.119> worry<00:01:10.270> about<00:01:10.360> that

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:10.540 
inner pulley and don't worry about that

00:01:10.540 --> 00:01:12.959 
inner pulley and don't worry about that
you<00:01:11.079> know<00:01:11.170> if<00:01:11.530> that<00:01:11.710> that's<00:01:12.130> exact<00:01:12.549> is<00:01:12.759> that

00:01:12.959 --> 00:01:12.969 
you know if that that's exact is that

00:01:12.969 --> 00:01:14.760 
you know if that that's exact is that
can<00:01:13.149> be<00:01:13.270> adjusted<00:01:13.719> by<00:01:13.750> lifting<00:01:14.200> this<00:01:14.290> up<00:01:14.500> and

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:14.770 
can be adjusted by lifting this up and

00:01:14.770 --> 00:01:19.080 
can be adjusted by lifting this up and
turning<00:01:15.840> like<00:01:16.840> this<00:01:17.549> so<00:01:18.549> once<00:01:18.789> we<00:01:18.969> get

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:19.090 
turning like this so once we get

00:01:19.090 --> 00:01:21.840 
turning like this so once we get
everything<00:01:19.329> in<00:01:19.630> I<00:01:19.750> can<00:01:19.930> fine<00:01:20.200> tune<00:01:20.250> okay<00:01:21.250> take

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:21.850 
everything in I can fine tune okay take

00:01:21.850 --> 00:01:24.149 
everything in I can fine tune okay take
this<00:01:21.969> panel<00:01:22.390> off<00:01:22.539> it's<00:01:23.110> not<00:01:23.259> too<00:01:23.590> bad<00:01:23.860> but<00:01:24.100> you

00:01:24.149 --> 00:01:24.159 
this panel off it's not too bad but you

00:01:24.159 --> 00:01:27.620 
this panel off it's not too bad but you
set<00:01:24.430> though<00:01:24.640> to<00:01:25.530> remove<00:01:26.530> a<00:01:26.619> couple<00:01:26.860> of<00:01:26.950> bolts

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:27.630 
set though to remove a couple of bolts

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:30.090 
set though to remove a couple of bolts
particular<00:01:28.630> the<00:01:28.990> seat<00:01:29.229> belt<00:01:29.469> one<00:01:29.710> we<00:01:29.920> have<00:01:30.009> to

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:30.100 
particular the seat belt one we have to

00:01:30.100 --> 00:01:32.370 
particular the seat belt one we have to
take<00:01:30.280> this<00:01:30.549> panel<00:01:31.090> off<00:01:31.270> there<00:01:32.079> to<00:01:32.200> take<00:01:32.350> a

00:01:32.370 --> 00:01:32.380 
take this panel off there to take a

00:01:32.380 --> 00:01:34.200 
take this panel off there to take a
speaker<00:01:32.890> out<00:01:33.070> and<00:01:33.340> we<00:01:33.399> have<00:01:33.490> to<00:01:33.579> take<00:01:33.759> the<00:01:33.909> jack

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:34.210 
speaker out and we have to take the jack

00:01:34.210 --> 00:01:36.599 
speaker out and we have to take the jack
out<00:01:34.450> because<00:01:35.140> there's<00:01:35.380> a<00:01:35.469> couple<00:01:36.130> screws<00:01:36.430> in

00:01:36.599 --> 00:01:36.609 
out because there's a couple screws in

00:01:36.609 --> 00:01:38.700 
out because there's a couple screws in
there<00:01:36.700> the<00:01:36.820> whole<00:01:36.909> display<00:01:37.439> what<00:01:38.439> makes<00:01:38.590> it

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:38.710 
there the whole display what makes it

00:01:38.710 --> 00:01:42.389 
there the whole display what makes it
easier<00:01:39.070> open<00:01:39.789> the<00:01:40.570> rear<00:01:40.780> window<00:01:41.170> and<00:01:41.380> take<00:01:42.219> off

00:01:42.389 --> 00:01:42.399 
easier open the rear window and take off

00:01:42.399 --> 00:01:45.149 
easier open the rear window and take off
the<00:01:42.549> trend<00:01:43.079> just<00:01:44.079> the<00:01:44.229> bottom<00:01:44.560> part<00:01:44.770> so<00:01:44.829> enough

00:01:45.149 --> 00:01:45.159 
the trend just the bottom part so enough

00:01:45.159 --> 00:01:48.060 
the trend just the bottom part so enough
so<00:01:45.310> that<00:01:45.340> you<00:01:45.909> know<00:01:46.200> this<00:01:47.200> power<00:01:47.469> can<00:01:47.649> come<00:01:47.890> off

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:48.070 
so that you know this power can come off

00:01:48.070 --> 00:01:50.520 
so that you know this power can come off
there's<00:01:49.030> a<00:01:49.149> speaker<00:01:49.600> if<00:01:49.719> removed<00:01:50.049> you<00:01:50.320> had<00:01:50.439> to

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:50.530 
there's a speaker if removed you had to

00:01:50.530 --> 00:01:52.529 
there's a speaker if removed you had to
move<00:01:50.619> the<00:01:50.859> three<00:01:51.039> screws<00:01:51.369> there's<00:01:52.149> one<00:01:52.359> more

00:01:52.529 --> 00:01:52.539 
move the three screws there's one more

00:01:52.539 --> 00:01:54.510 
move the three screws there's one more
screw<00:01:52.869> right<00:01:53.049> there<00:01:53.109> you<00:01:53.409> have<00:01:53.500> to<00:01:53.649> remove<00:01:53.920> and

00:01:54.510 --> 00:01:54.520 
screw right there you have to remove and

00:01:54.520 --> 00:01:56.690 
screw right there you have to remove and
where<00:01:55.210> the<00:01:55.329> jack<00:01:55.539> is<00:01:55.780> take<00:01:56.109> it<00:01:56.259> out<00:01:56.380> and

00:01:56.690 --> 00:01:56.700 
where the jack is take it out and

00:01:56.700 --> 00:01:58.889 
where the jack is take it out and
there's<00:01:57.700> a<00:01:57.759> screw<00:01:58.090> right<00:01:58.299> there

00:01:58.889 --> 00:01:58.899 
there's a screw right there

00:01:58.899 --> 00:02:01.080 
there's a screw right there
you<00:01:59.619> have<00:01:59.710> to<00:01:59.829> remove<00:02:00.039> that<00:02:00.249> and<00:02:00.520> then<00:02:00.850> there's

00:02:01.080 --> 00:02:01.090 
you have to remove that and then there's

00:02:01.090 --> 00:02:03.919 
you have to remove that and then there's
another<00:02:01.179> screw<00:02:01.689> right<00:02:02.079> there<00:02:02.439> to<00:02:03.399> take<00:02:03.609> out

00:02:03.919 --> 00:02:03.929 
another screw right there to take out

00:02:03.929 --> 00:02:06.929 
another screw right there to take out
all<00:02:04.929> right<00:02:05.049> and<00:02:05.380> this<00:02:05.859> is<00:02:06.100> the<00:02:06.130> panel<00:02:06.640> removed

00:02:06.929 --> 00:02:06.939 
all right and this is the panel removed

00:02:06.939 --> 00:02:10.440 
all right and this is the panel removed
now<00:02:07.740> so<00:02:08.740> you<00:02:08.860> can<00:02:09.009> see<00:02:09.220> what<00:02:09.580> it's<00:02:09.700> like<00:02:09.910> also

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:10.450

me show you what I did how to attach the
bracket<00:03:07.530> the<00:03:08.530> original<00:03:08.950> idea<00:03:09.250> that<00:03:09.400> I<00:03:09.430> had<00:03:09.670> to

00:03:09.810 --> 00:03:09.820 
bracket the original idea that I had to

00:03:09.820 --> 00:03:13.920 
bracket the original idea that I had to
not<00:03:10.000> work<00:03:10.240> the<00:03:10.570> the<00:03:11.140> cable<00:03:11.470> broke<00:03:12.450> so<00:03:13.450> what<00:03:13.900> I

00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:13.930 
not work the the cable broke so what I

00:03:13.930 --> 00:03:16.800 
not work the the cable broke so what I
did<00:03:14.050> was<00:03:14.350> I<00:03:14.560> bought<00:03:14.770> this<00:03:15.040> I<00:03:15.550> guess<00:03:16.270> ground<00:03:16.570> log

00:03:16.800 --> 00:03:16.810 
did was I bought this I guess ground log

00:03:16.810 --> 00:03:19.470 
did was I bought this I guess ground log
at<00:03:16.959> Home<00:03:17.080> Depot<00:03:17.470> and<00:03:17.500> I<00:03:17.650> shaved<00:03:17.950> off<00:03:18.240> the<00:03:19.240> leg

00:03:19.470 --> 00:03:19.480 
at Home Depot and I shaved off the leg

00:03:19.480 --> 00:03:23.690 
at Home Depot and I shaved off the leg
and<00:03:20.010> it<00:03:21.010> fits<00:03:21.310> perfect<00:03:21.820> and<00:03:22.510> just<00:03:22.540> to<00:03:23.230> show<00:03:23.470> you

00:03:23.690 --> 00:03:23.700 
and it fits perfect and just to show you

00:03:23.700 --> 00:03:27.150 
and it fits perfect and just to show you
what<00:03:24.700> what<00:03:25.630> one<00:03:25.900> looks<00:03:26.140> like<00:03:26.260> when<00:03:26.890> it's<00:03:27.010> not

00:03:27.150 --> 00:03:27.160 
what what one looks like when it's not

00:03:27.160 --> 00:03:29.670 
what what one looks like when it's not
grounded<00:03:27.940> I<00:03:28.090> didn't<00:03:28.930> grind<00:03:29.080> it<00:03:29.290> yet

00:03:29.670 --> 00:03:29.680 
grounded I didn't grind it yet

00:03:29.680 --> 00:03:32.850 
grounded I didn't grind it yet
it's<00:03:29.890> this<00:03:30.870> so<00:03:31.870> if<00:03:31.959> you<00:03:32.050> use<00:03:32.170> this<00:03:32.380> and<00:03:32.620> take

00:03:32.850 --> 00:03:32.860 
it's this so if you use this and take

00:03:32.860 --> 00:03:36.060 
it's this so if you use this and take
off<00:03:33.010> the<00:03:33.160> leg<00:03:33.340> part<00:03:33.640> and<00:03:34.440> grind<00:03:35.440> this<00:03:35.769> round

00:03:36.060 --> 00:03:36.070 
off the leg part and grind this round

00:03:36.070 --> 00:03:38.490 
off the leg part and grind this round
piece<00:03:36.280> it<00:03:36.459> should<00:03:37.000> fit<00:03:37.360> perfectly<00:03:37.570> I<00:03:37.900> think

00:03:38.490 --> 00:03:38.500 
piece it should fit perfectly I think

00:03:38.500 --> 00:03:40.050 
piece it should fit perfectly I think
it's<00:03:38.590> going<00:03:38.709> to<00:03:38.769> give<00:03:38.920> a<00:03:38.950> more<00:03:39.280> stronger

00:03:40.050 --> 00:03:40.060 
it's going to give a more stronger

00:03:40.060 --> 00:03:41.729 
it's going to give a more stronger
connection<00:03:40.570> just<00:03:40.810> just<00:03:41.019> trying<00:03:41.230> to<00:03:41.320> crimp<00:03:41.620> a
