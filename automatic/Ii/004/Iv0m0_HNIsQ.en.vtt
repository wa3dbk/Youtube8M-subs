00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
 1 

00:00:02.590 --> 00:00:04.590
 and 

00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:21.080
 we will start the tablet together and 

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:21.080
 see how it works 

00:00:25.440 --> 00:00:28.950
 the tablet starts if you have any 

00:00:27.030 --> 00:00:30.960
 little trouble starting it may be that 

00:00:28.950 --> 00:00:32.460
 in the order of boot windows has remained 

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:33.629
 first so you will not see 

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:36.390
 the dual boot or that's how 

00:00:33.629 --> 00:00:37.860
 introduces a little boot here so the 

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:38.640
 possibility to start on windows 

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:40.890
 either under android 

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:43.650
 so we always select with the 

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:46.200
 volume button down volume and at 

00:00:43.650 --> 00:00:48.570
 same as for the station installation at 

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:50.850
 you duo volume selects this what 

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:52.590
 this gift what you have those 

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:55.170
 of which you have selected 

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:56.579
 so be careful in december 

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:57.300
 with the down arrow until we 

00:00:56.579 --> 00:00:59.489
 choose what you want 

00:00:57.300 --> 00:01:01.110
 the fast boot mode and their fashion bodies 

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:02.520
 eco-responsible art for now 

00:01:01.110 --> 00:01:03.120
 are useless there is no chlorine 

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:05.640
 short fashion 

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:07.049
 for now it's not at all 

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:08.549
 all interesting what you need 

00:01:07.049 --> 00:01:10.560
 it's either windows or android 

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:14.729
 so let's go we'll see that the 

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:16.950
 taste is fast enough so with the 

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:18.899
 intel logo to make it clear that ben 

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:19.649
 it is intel who made the project because 

00:01:18.899 --> 00:01:22.079
 carry out the project 

00:01:19.649 --> 00:01:25.740
 and here we are on android 4 2 2 on the 

00:01:22.079 --> 00:01:30.179
 tablet that works wonderfully 

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:31.859
 well here with here an installation 

00:01:30.179 --> 00:01:34.020
 ready to use 

00:01:31.859 --> 00:01:35.670
 it's very very fluid good so there a 

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:36.719
 small start small hangs but 

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:38.700
 look you can go there 

00:01:36.719 --> 00:01:40.229
 once started the applications 

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:42.179
 start very quickly in 

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:43.889
 offices it's very very fluid if I 

00:01:42.179 --> 00:01:47.579
 launches an application like the plextor 

00:01:43.889 --> 00:01:49.170
 for example here is so suddenly we have 

00:01:47.579 --> 00:01:52.079
 access to applications that for the 

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:52.979
 moment are not very numerous it is 

00:01:52.079 --> 00:01:55.499
 true they are much less provided 

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:57.539
 since a lot of applications are not 

00:01:55.499 --> 00:02:00.869
 not compatible with intel mode but 

00:01:57.539 --> 00:02:02.450
 we already have quite a lot of it here if I 

00:02:00.869 --> 00:02:06.119
 shows you quickly 

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:08.489
 here we are already pretty well supplied and 

00:02:06.119 --> 00:02:09.989
 even I will tell you at stake since we have 

00:02:08.489 --> 00:02:11.849
 games that work very well I 

00:02:09.989 --> 00:02:13.940
 you make a little demo we will launch 

00:02:11.849 --> 00:02:16.910
 already asphalt to start 

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:17.990
 which is gameloft's game and I can 

00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:21.460
 tell you that rendering on this 

00:02:17.990 --> 00:02:21.460
 tablet is just gorgeous 

00:02:33.450 --> 00:02:41.550
 So suddenly everything starts very quickly 

00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:44.519
 put her a little of her lesson works 

00:02:41.550 --> 00:02:46.670
 no problem we can go we go 

00:02:44.519 --> 00:02:49.470
 do a quick game 

00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:54.120
 oh yes always I always do this 

00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:56.280
 mistake it's gone we go so I think 

00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:59.370
 that yes the juris'cup works from 

00:02:56.280 --> 00:03:01.290
 memory in iraq test right behind the 

00:02:59.370 --> 00:03:03.180
 me it's true that at this game I like the 

00:03:01.290 --> 00:03:05.690
 play with both keys for at the 

00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:05.690
 right and left 

00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:14.010
 the menus load quickly enough 

00:03:08.060 --> 00:03:16.829
 it's pretty impressive and 

00:03:14.010 --> 00:03:19.410
 I will try to put you little ones 

00:03:16.829 --> 00:03:23.030
 bench so I'm all that people and 

00:03:19.410 --> 00:03:25.650
 I will have some time on the article 

00:03:23.030 --> 00:03:28.560
 so see if it works very very 

00:03:25.650 --> 00:03:38.220
 well and we will quickly do the test 

00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:40.290
 of the accelerometer tac the accelerometer 

00:03:38.220 --> 00:03:41.450
 we're just going to take axelera 

00:03:40.290 --> 00:03:46.049
 only 

00:03:41.450 --> 00:03:48.540
 this is motorcycle acceleration simply and we 

00:03:46.049 --> 00:03:49.109
 resumes and the accelerometer runs at 

00:03:48.540 --> 00:03:51.510
 wonder 

00:03:49.109 --> 00:03:53.639
 so here you are going to enjoy 

00:03:51.510 --> 00:03:56.579
 it's really well done it's 

00:03:53.639 --> 00:03:59.370
 really nice but here I wanted to ride 

00:03:56.579 --> 00:04:00.720
 not in the best conditions the 

00:03:59.370 --> 00:04:03.870
 game that was it to show 

00:04:00.720 --> 00:04:05.579
 quickly we also have small 

00:04:03.870 --> 00:04:09.590
 games that work but also 

00:04:05.579 --> 00:04:12.150
 to nova who is just gorgeous 

00:04:09.590 --> 00:04:15.510
 the righteous years very quickly it's okay 

00:04:12.150 --> 00:04:17.250
 really fast and they are really 

00:04:15.510 --> 00:04:19.620
 we have the impression that with the full slab 

00:04:17.250 --> 00:04:21.750
 w700's hd the games are even more 

00:04:19.620 --> 00:04:24.720
 beautiful goes up to a more beautiful rendering still 

00:04:21.750 --> 00:04:27.200
 that on our phones and that's really 

00:04:24.720 --> 00:04:27.200
 very impressive 

00:04:27.530 --> 00:04:37.139
 so suddenly we launch the campaign is 

00:04:32.250 --> 00:04:39.470
 lesson party still works no 

00:04:37.139 --> 00:04:39.470
 problem 

00:05:03.729 --> 00:05:07.800
 it's gone suddenly the game works 

00:05:07.180 --> 00:05:19.599
 very well 

00:05:07.800 --> 00:05:27.370
 we go it's true that in the emotion 

00:05:19.599 --> 00:05:30.009
 himself as we play here that's it 

00:05:27.370 --> 00:05:32.439

00:05:34.870 --> 00:05:39.479
 really in the heart of the subject so that's it 

00:05:40.389 --> 00:05:44.349
