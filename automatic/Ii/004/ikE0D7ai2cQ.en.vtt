00:00:29.980 --> 00:00:32.170 

okay<00:00:30.980> the<00:00:31.130> rear<00:00:31.310> caliper<00:00:31.730> is<00:00:31.850> a<00:00:31.880> little<00:00:32.090> bit

00:00:32.170 --> 00:00:32.180 
okay the rear caliper is a little bit

00:00:32.180 --> 00:00:33.610 
okay the rear caliper is a little bit
different<00:00:32.540> than<00:00:32.630> the<00:00:32.720> front<00:00:32.989> calipers<00:00:33.500> you

00:00:33.610 --> 00:00:33.620 
different than the front calipers you

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:35.350 
different than the front calipers you
can<00:00:33.739> see<00:00:33.829> where<00:00:33.980> it's<00:00:34.070> perched<00:00:34.370> on<00:00:34.610> top<00:00:34.760> of<00:00:35.180> the

00:00:35.350 --> 00:00:35.360 
can see where it's perched on top of the

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:37.990 
can see where it's perched on top of the
rotor<00:00:35.710> the<00:00:36.710> retainer<00:00:37.100> is<00:00:37.250> still<00:00:37.460> two<00:00:37.640> bolts<00:00:37.970> on

00:00:37.990 --> 00:00:38.000 
rotor the retainer is still two bolts on

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:39.250 
rotor the retainer is still two bolts on
the<00:00:38.120> backside<00:00:38.600> we're<00:00:38.780> going<00:00:38.930> to<00:00:38.989> take<00:00:39.110> those

00:00:39.250 --> 00:00:39.260 
the backside we're going to take those

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:41.319 
the backside we're going to take those
loose<00:00:39.559> pop<00:00:40.280> the<00:00:40.460> caliper<00:00:40.879> off<00:00:41.000> and<00:00:41.150> we'll<00:00:41.239> take

00:00:41.319 --> 00:00:41.329 
loose pop the caliper off and we'll take

00:00:41.329 --> 00:00:54.820 
loose pop the caliper off and we'll take
a<00:00:41.390> good<00:00:41.600> look<00:00:41.809> at<00:00:41.960> everything<00:00:53.620> the<00:00:54.620> rear

00:00:54.820 --> 00:00:54.830 
a good look at everything the rear

00:00:54.830 --> 00:00:56.200 
a good look at everything the rear
brakes<00:00:55.100> on<00:00:55.250> this<00:00:55.370> are<00:00:55.489> kind<00:00:55.699> of<00:00:55.850> unique

00:00:56.200 --> 00:00:56.210 
brakes on this are kind of unique

00:00:56.210 --> 00:00:58.090 
brakes on this are kind of unique
compared<00:00:56.660> to<00:00:56.720> the<00:00:56.870> front<00:00:57.140> we're<00:00:57.800> only<00:00:57.920> looking

00:00:58.090 --> 00:00:58.100 
compared to the front we're only looking

00:00:58.100 --> 00:01:00.250 
compared to the front we're only looking
at<00:00:58.309> one<00:00:58.610> half<00:00:58.940> of<00:00:59.120> the<00:00:59.269> brake<00:00:59.540> system<00:00:59.570> because

00:01:00.250 --> 00:01:00.260 
at one half of the brake system because

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:02.290 
at one half of the brake system because
the<00:01:00.470> rear<00:01:00.650> brakes<00:01:00.949> also<00:01:01.610> have<00:01:01.789> the<00:01:01.940> parking

00:01:02.290 --> 00:01:02.300 
the rear brakes also have the parking

00:01:02.300 --> 00:01:04.299 
the rear brakes also have the parking
brake<00:01:02.510> assembly<00:01:02.989> we<00:01:03.649> can't<00:01:03.860> even<00:01:03.980> see<00:01:04.190> the

00:01:04.299 --> 00:01:04.309 
brake assembly we can't even see the

00:01:04.309 --> 00:01:05.620 
brake assembly we can't even see the
parking<00:01:04.640> brake<00:01:04.789> assembly<00:01:05.180> because<00:01:05.449> it's

00:01:05.620 --> 00:01:05.630 
parking brake assembly because it's

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:07.540 
parking brake assembly because it's
inside<00:01:06.110> of<00:01:06.350> the<00:01:06.530> rotor<00:01:06.830> this<00:01:07.100> is<00:01:07.250> getting<00:01:07.490> to

00:01:07.540 --> 00:01:07.550 
inside of the rotor this is getting to

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:09.430 
inside of the rotor this is getting to
be<00:01:07.580> more<00:01:07.670> and<00:01:07.880> more<00:01:08.090> of<00:01:08.270> a<00:01:08.420> common<00:01:08.810> parking

00:01:09.430 --> 00:01:09.440 
be more and more of a common parking

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:11.710 
be more and more of a common parking
brake<00:01:09.619> design<00:01:09.850> when<00:01:10.850> I<00:01:10.880> take<00:01:11.090> that<00:01:11.210> rotor<00:01:11.479> off

00:01:11.710 --> 00:01:11.720 
brake design when I take that rotor off

00:01:11.720 --> 00:01:12.969 
brake design when I take that rotor off
I'll<00:01:11.990> be<00:01:12.080> able<00:01:12.140> to<00:01:12.259> look<00:01:12.410> at<00:01:12.560> that<00:01:12.740> I'm<00:01:12.860> gonna

00:01:12.969 --> 00:01:12.979 
I'll be able to look at that I'm gonna

00:01:12.979 --> 00:01:14.260 
I'll be able to look at that I'm gonna
look<00:01:13.070> at<00:01:13.220> that<00:01:13.310> first<00:01:13.580> and<00:01:13.789> then<00:01:13.850> make<00:01:14.180> an

00:01:14.260 --> 00:01:14.270 
look at that first and then make an

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:15.609 
look at that first and then make an
overall<00:01:14.570> decision<00:01:15.020> of<00:01:15.080> what<00:01:15.200> I<00:01:15.229> need<00:01:15.410> to<00:01:15.500> do

the<00:02:09.860> nice<00:02:10.040> thing<00:02:10.070> about<00:02:10.280> this<00:02:10.670> is<00:02:10.940> is<00:02:11.660> this<00:02:11.870> is

00:02:11.949 --> 00:02:11.959 
the nice thing about this is is this is

00:02:11.959 --> 00:02:14.319 
the nice thing about this is is this is
a<00:02:12.019> total<00:02:12.440> mechanical<00:02:12.560> style<00:02:13.280> brake<00:02:13.700> system<00:02:14.150> so

00:02:14.319 --> 00:02:14.329 
a total mechanical style brake system so

00:02:14.329 --> 00:02:16.150 
a total mechanical style brake system so
in<00:02:14.600> the<00:02:14.720> event<00:02:14.810> that<00:02:15.170> your<00:02:15.290> hydraulic<00:02:15.860> system

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:16.160 
in the event that your hydraulic system

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:18.280 
in the event that your hydraulic system
would<00:02:16.310> fail<00:02:16.579> you<00:02:17.360> can<00:02:17.510> push<00:02:17.690> the<00:02:17.840> emergency

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:18.290 
would fail you can push the emergency

00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:20.620 
would fail you can push the emergency
brake<00:02:18.739> or<00:02:18.920> parking<00:02:18.950> brake<00:02:19.670> and<00:02:19.940> I'll<00:02:20.420> go<00:02:20.540> ahead

00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:20.630 
brake or parking brake and I'll go ahead

00:02:20.630 --> 00:02:22.060 
brake or parking brake and I'll go ahead
and<00:02:20.840> apply<00:02:21.079> the<00:02:21.140> brakes<00:02:21.380> in<00:02:21.620> the<00:02:21.680> back<00:02:21.890> so

00:02:22.060 --> 00:02:22.070 
and apply the brakes in the back so

00:02:22.070 --> 00:02:23.920 
and apply the brakes in the back so
you'll<00:02:22.160> still<00:02:22.370> have<00:02:22.549> a<00:02:22.610> braking<00:02:23.000> system<00:02:23.390> what

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:23.930 
you'll still have a braking system what

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:25.270 
you'll still have a braking system what
we<00:02:24.019> want<00:02:24.170> to<00:02:24.230> do<00:02:24.320> now<00:02:24.440> this<00:02:24.650> has<00:02:24.980> a<00:02:25.010> lot<00:02:25.220> of

00:02:25.270 --> 00:02:25.280 
we want to do now this has a lot of

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:27.310 
we want to do now this has a lot of
brake<00:02:25.670> dust<00:02:25.700> on<00:02:26.180> it<00:02:26.329> you<00:02:26.720> never<00:02:26.930> want<00:02:27.230> to<00:02:27.260> use

00:02:27.310 --> 00:02:27.320 
brake dust on it you never want to use

00:02:27.320 --> 00:02:29.380 
brake dust on it you never want to use
air<00:02:27.769> compressed<00:02:28.310> air<00:02:28.489> to<00:02:28.610> blow<00:02:28.700> the<00:02:28.790> dust<00:02:28.940> off

00:02:29.380 --> 00:02:29.390 
air compressed air to blow the dust off

00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:30.850 
air compressed air to blow the dust off
there<00:02:29.660> so<00:02:30.140> I'm<00:02:30.200> gonna<00:02:30.290> take<00:02:30.410> brake<00:02:30.650> cleaner

00:02:30.850 --> 00:02:30.860 
there so I'm gonna take brake cleaner

00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:32.470 
there so I'm gonna take brake cleaner
and<00:02:30.980> spray<00:02:31.070> everything<00:02:31.430> down<00:02:31.760> and<00:02:32.000> then<00:02:32.360> we'll

00:02:32.470 --> 00:02:32.480 
and spray everything down and then we'll

00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:49.110 
and spray everything down and then we'll
take<00:02:32.630> a<00:02:32.660> good<00:02:32.810> look<00:02:32.959> at<00:02:33.079> everything

00:02:49.110 --> 00:02:49.120 

00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:51.640 

well<00:02:50.120> I'd<00:02:50.209> say<00:02:50.240> we<00:02:50.480> probably<00:02:50.510> have<00:02:50.870> about<00:02:51.020> 3/4

00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:51.650 
well I'd say we probably have about 3/4

00:02:51.650 --> 00:02:53.830 
well I'd say we probably have about 3/4
of<00:02:51.680> our<00:02:51.830> disk<00:02:52.130> pad<00:02:52.459> left<00:02:52.850> over<00:02:53.120> in<00:02:53.180> reality<00:02:53.720> we

00:02:53.830 --> 00:02:53.840 
of our disk pad left over in reality we

00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:55.330 
of our disk pad left over in reality we
could<00:02:53.990> go<00:02:54.080> ahead<00:02:54.200> and<00:02:54.319> not<00:02:54.770> do<00:02:54.980> the<00:02:55.010> rear

00:02:55.330 --> 00:02:55.340 
could go ahead and not do the rear

00:02:55.340 --> 00:02:56.620 
could go ahead and not do the rear
brakes<00:02:55.640> but<00:02:55.850> I<00:02:55.940> want<00:02:56.150> to<00:02:56.239> go<00:02:56.360> through<00:02:56.569> the

00:02:56.620 --> 00:02:56.630 
brakes but I want to go through the

00:02:56.630 --> 00:02:58.000 
brakes but I want to go through the
procedure<00:02:56.989> and<00:02:57.200> show<00:02:57.319> you<00:02:57.380> how<00:02:57.560> to<00:02:57.620> do<00:02:57.830> this

00:02:58.000 --> 00:02:58.010 
procedure and show you how to do this

00:02:58.010 --> 00:03:00.880 
procedure and show you how to do this
also<00:02:58.819> on<00:02:59.120> our<00:02:59.270> parking<00:02:59.660> brake<00:02:59.930> it<00:03:00.590> looks<00:03:00.770> like

00:03:00.880 --> 00:03:00.890 
also on our parking brake it looks like

00:03:00.890 --> 00:03:02.470 
also on our parking brake it looks like
this<00:03:01.010> has<00:03:01.160> hardly<00:03:01.400> ever<00:03:01.580> been<00:03:01.880> used<00:03:01.940> because

00:03:02.470 --> 00:03:02.480 
this has hardly ever been used because

00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:03.910 
this has hardly ever been used because
I'd<00:03:02.660> say<00:03:02.780> that's<00:03:02.959> close<00:03:03.170> to<00:03:03.230> the<00:03:03.410> original

00:03:03.910 --> 00:03:03.920 
I'd say that's close to the original

00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:06.280 
I'd say that's close to the original
thickness<00:03:04.430> of<00:03:04.640> the<00:03:04.850> shoes<00:03:05.150> everything<00:03:06.080> there

00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:06.290 
thickness of the shoes everything there

00:03:06.290 --> 00:03:07.479 
thickness of the shoes everything there
looks<00:03:06.500> fine<00:03:06.709> I<00:03:06.739> think<00:03:06.950> we'll<00:03:07.100> go<00:03:07.220> ahead<00:03:07.310> and

00:03:07.479 --> 00:03:07.489 
looks fine I think we'll go ahead and

00:03:07.489 --> 00:03:09.070 
looks fine I think we'll go ahead and
replace<00:03:07.670> the<00:03:07.970> disc<00:03:08.209> pads<00:03:08.450> we'll<00:03:08.720> go<00:03:08.840> ahead<00:03:08.930> and

00:03:09.070 --> 00:03:09.080 
replace the disc pads we'll go ahead and

00:03:09.080 --> 00:03:11.199 
replace the disc pads we'll go ahead and
replace<00:03:09.380> the<00:03:09.709> rotors<00:03:10.130> our<00:03:10.370> front<00:03:10.940> loaders

00:03:11.199 --> 00:03:11.209 
replace the rotors our front loaders

00:03:11.209 --> 00:03:13.240 
replace the rotors our front loaders
were<00:03:11.300> grooved<00:03:11.930> a<00:03:12.050> lot<00:03:12.230> worse<00:03:12.560> than<00:03:12.590> our<00:03:12.980> back

00:03:13.240 --> 00:03:13.250 
were grooved a lot worse than our back

00:03:13.250 --> 00:03:14.890 
were grooved a lot worse than our back
ones<00:03:13.580> but<00:03:13.730> you<00:03:13.850> can<00:03:13.910> see<00:03:14.180> we<00:03:14.300> do<00:03:14.450> have<00:03:14.570> a<00:03:14.600> couple

00:03:14.890 --> 00:03:14.900 
ones but you can see we do have a couple

00:03:14.900 --> 00:03:16.900 
ones but you can see we do have a couple
of<00:03:14.989> deep<00:03:15.200> grooves<00:03:15.590> in<00:03:15.769> the<00:03:15.860> rotors<00:03:16.190> so<00:03:16.790> we'll

00:03:16.900 --> 00:03:16.910 
of deep grooves in the rotors so we'll

00:03:16.910 --> 00:03:18.250 
of deep grooves in the rotors so we'll
put<00:03:17.030> a<00:03:17.060> new<00:03:17.150> disc<00:03:17.360> pads<00:03:17.570> on<00:03:17.840> it<00:03:17.870> and<00:03:18.080> rear

00:03:18.250 --> 00:03:18.260 
put a new disc pads on it and rear

00:03:18.260 --> 00:03:34.530 
put a new disc pads on it and rear
rotors<00:03:18.590> and<00:03:18.709> we<00:03:18.800> should<00:03:18.980> be<00:03:19.070> in<00:03:19.160> good<00:03:19.310> shape

00:03:34.530 --> 00:03:34.540 

00:03:34.540 --> 00:03:36.550 

well<00:03:35.540> the<00:03:35.630> next<00:03:35.780> step<00:03:35.989> is<00:03:36.110> just<00:03:36.140> like<00:03:36.410> the

00:03:36.550 --> 00:03:36.560 
well the next step is just like the

00:03:36.560 --> 00:03:38.500 
well the next step is just like the
front<00:03:36.800> we<00:03:37.010> need<00:03:37.160> to<00:03:37.220> push<00:03:37.430> the<00:03:37.610> piston<00:03:37.819> back<00:03:38.239> in

00:03:38.500 --> 00:03:38.510 
front we need to push the piston back in

00:03:38.510 --> 00:03:50.110 
front we need to push the piston back in
and<00:03:38.630> put<00:03:38.720> our<00:03:38.810> new<00:03:38.930> pads<00:03:39.170> in<00:03:39.380> place

you<00:03:50.659> also<00:03:50.780> want<00:03:50.959> to<00:03:50.989> make<00:03:51.140> sure<00:03:51.290> that<00:03:51.409> you<00:03:51.560> Lube

00:03:51.759 --> 00:03:51.769 
you also want to make sure that you Lube

the contact and slide points which would

00:03:53.750 --> 00:03:55.720 
the contact and slide points which would
be<00:03:53.870> both<00:03:54.140> sides<00:03:54.440> of<00:03:54.650> the<00:03:54.739> caliper<00:03:55.190> bracket

there is in good condition because if it
isn't<00:04:28.580> I<00:04:28.610> have<00:04:28.699> to<00:04:28.760> replace<00:04:28.970> them<00:04:29.210> as<00:04:29.330> a<00:04:29.360> pair

00:04:29.620 --> 00:04:29.630 
isn't I have to replace them as a pair

00:04:29.630 --> 00:04:36.719 
isn't I have to replace them as a pair
let's<00:04:30.050> go<00:04:30.169> and<00:04:30.260> check<00:04:30.380> that<00:04:30.560> next

00:04:36.719 --> 00:04:36.729 

00:04:36.729 --> 00:04:38.890 

well<00:04:37.729> the<00:04:37.789> caliper<00:04:38.150> on<00:04:38.240> this<00:04:38.389> side<00:04:38.570> is<00:04:38.690> in<00:04:38.780> good

00:04:38.890 --> 00:04:38.900 
well the caliper on this side is in good

00:04:38.900 --> 00:04:40.659 
well the caliper on this side is in good
shape<00:04:38.960> as<00:04:39.350> well<00:04:39.560> so<00:04:39.830> what<00:04:39.949> we<00:04:39.979> need<00:04:40.190> to<00:04:40.310> do<00:04:40.460> is

00:04:40.659 --> 00:04:40.669 
shape as well so what we need to do is

00:04:40.669 --> 00:04:42.909 
shape as well so what we need to do is
replace<00:04:40.940> the<00:04:41.060> disc<00:04:41.479> pads<00:04:41.750> put<00:04:42.410> the<00:04:42.470> new<00:04:42.590> rotors

00:04:42.909 --> 00:04:42.919 
replace the disc pads put the new rotors

00:04:42.919 --> 00:04:48.610 
replace the disc pads put the new rotors
on<00:04:43.100> and<00:04:43.520> we'll<00:04:43.610> be<00:04:43.639> like<00:04:43.880> new<00:04:44.060> again
