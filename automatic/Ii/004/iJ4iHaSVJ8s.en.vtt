00:01:48.460 --> 00:01:50.910 
charlie yeah and it was a bit to talk
really<00:01:48.819> to<00:01:49.000> mix<00:01:49.300> that<00:01:49.479> and<00:01:49.720> such<00:01:50.259> like<00:01:50.530> all<00:01:50.800> the

00:01:50.910 --> 00:01:50.920 
really to mix that and such like all the

00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:52.800 
really to mix that and such like all the
hard<00:01:51.069> training<00:01:51.310> that<00:01:51.520> we<00:01:51.610> were<00:01:51.700> doing<00:01:51.970> I'm<00:01:52.300> I

00:01:52.800 --> 00:01:52.810 
hard training that we were doing I'm I

00:01:52.810 --> 00:01:55.680 
hard training that we were doing I'm I
was<00:01:53.140> out<00:01:53.289> in<00:01:53.500> them<00:01:53.710> trying<00:01:54.520> to<00:01:54.670> sort<00:01:54.940> of<00:01:55.030> for

00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:55.690 
was out in them trying to sort of for

00:01:55.690 --> 00:01:57.749 
was out in them trying to sort of for
the<00:01:55.780> month<00:01:55.960> before<00:01:56.170> my<00:01:56.500> exam<00:01:56.619> and<00:01:57.190> I<00:01:57.399> was<00:01:57.580> sort

00:01:57.749 --> 00:01:57.759 
the month before my exam and I was sort

00:01:57.759 --> 00:01:59.399 
the month before my exam and I was sort
of<00:01:57.789> trying<00:01:57.940> to<00:01:58.119> cram<00:01:58.300> it<00:01:58.420> in<00:01:58.539> as<00:01:58.750> well<00:01:59.259> as

00:01:59.399 --> 00:01:59.409 
of trying to cram it in as well as

00:01:59.409 --> 00:02:01.200 
of trying to cram it in as well as
resting<00:01:59.979> and<00:02:00.220> training<00:02:00.759> all<00:02:00.880> at<00:02:01.030> the<00:02:01.090> same

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:01.210 
resting and training all at the same

00:02:01.210 --> 00:02:03.450 
resting and training all at the same
time<00:02:01.270> and<00:02:01.690> it<00:02:02.530> just<00:02:02.770> didn't<00:02:03.009> it<00:02:03.130> didn't<00:02:03.340> work

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:03.460 
time and it just didn't it didn't work

00:02:03.460 --> 00:02:05.999 
time and it just didn't it didn't work
out<00:02:03.640> so<00:02:03.909> I<00:02:03.940> think<00:02:04.179> we<00:02:04.390> need<00:02:04.509> to<00:02:04.569> sort<00:02:04.869> of<00:02:05.009> take

00:02:05.999 --> 00:02:06.009 
out so I think we need to sort of take

00:02:06.009 --> 00:02:07.680 
out so I think we need to sort of take
it<00:02:06.220> step<00:02:06.670> by<00:02:06.700> step<00:02:06.910> kind<00:02:07.420> of<00:02:07.479> it<00:02:07.569> but

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:07.690 
it step by step kind of it but

00:02:07.690 --> 00:02:10.830 
it step by step kind of it but
eventually<00:02:07.959> university<00:02:09.149> maybe<00:02:10.149> I<00:02:10.509> mean<00:02:10.750> I

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:10.840 
eventually university maybe I mean I

00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:13.830 
eventually university maybe I mean I
promise<00:02:11.349> personally<00:02:12.040> I<00:02:12.069> I<00:02:12.310> think<00:02:13.030> that<00:02:13.360> we

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:13.840 
promise personally I I think that we

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:15.390 
promise personally I I think that we
won't<00:02:14.050> that<00:02:14.170> we<00:02:14.260> learn<00:02:14.440> in<00:02:14.709> school<00:02:14.920> I've<00:02:15.250> been

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:15.400 
won't that we learn in school I've been

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:17.309 
won't that we learn in school I've been
playing<00:02:15.580> it<00:02:15.760> now<00:02:15.879> 15<00:02:16.300> years<00:02:16.330> and<00:02:16.720> I<00:02:16.780> think<00:02:16.810> that

00:02:17.309 --> 00:02:17.319 
playing it now 15 years and I think that

00:02:17.319 --> 00:02:20.580 
playing it now 15 years and I think that
in<00:02:17.470> its<00:02:17.770> way<00:02:18.370> is<00:02:18.640> kind<00:02:18.879> of<00:02:19.349> studying<00:02:20.349> for<00:02:20.560> a

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:20.590 
in its way is kind of studying for a

00:02:20.590 --> 00:02:22.830 
in its way is kind of studying for a
degree<00:02:20.709> it's<00:02:21.670> kind<00:02:22.000> of<00:02:22.120> a<00:02:22.330> degree<00:02:22.569> in<00:02:22.660> ten

00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:22.840 
degree it's kind of a degree in ten

00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:25.380 
degree it's kind of a degree in ten
times<00:02:23.050> if<00:02:23.230> you<00:02:23.290> like<00:02:23.500> and<00:02:23.830> I<00:02:24.010> hope<00:02:24.459> personally

00:02:25.380 --> 00:02:25.390 
times if you like and I hope personally

00:02:25.390 --> 00:02:27.000 
times if you like and I hope personally
I'd<00:02:25.540> like<00:02:25.720> to<00:02:25.840> stay<00:02:26.020> in<00:02:26.050> the<00:02:26.260> sport<00:02:26.530> after<00:02:26.890> that

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:27.010
