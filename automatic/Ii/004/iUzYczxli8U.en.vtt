 Hello dear friends and todays 

00:00:03.280 --> 00:00:08.679
 video we will tell you how to strengthen 

00:00:05.440 --> 00:00:09.490
 helmet well or other parts of the costume from 

00:00:08.679 --> 00:00:13.179
 papier mache 

00:00:09.490 --> 00:00:18.430
 for this you need glue usually i 

00:00:13.179 --> 00:00:22.750
 just a4 paper and a water bucket but I 

00:00:18.430 --> 00:00:26.220
 already made as it were blanks and today we 

00:00:22.750 --> 00:00:29.050
 we will show you how you will need to strengthen 

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:33.580
 Now I will tell you how to do it 

00:00:29.050 --> 00:00:38.080
 you need this paper 

00:00:33.580 --> 00:00:42.510
 bucket of water and leafing through 4 somewhat you 

00:00:38.080 --> 00:00:47.940
 should take a few A4 sheets at once and 

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:51.790
 divide well cut into small pieces 

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:56.470
 then you need to moisten the paper with water 

00:00:51.790 --> 00:00:59.739
 and very well survive and and and you 

00:00:56.470 --> 00:01:01.960
 It turns out such preparations now 

00:00:59.739 --> 00:01:12.310
 will need to add to these blanks 

00:01:01.960 --> 00:01:15.100
 pva glue and now i need to excuse me 

00:01:12.310 --> 00:01:18.430
 We now need to stir problems 

00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:20.110
 glue with paper is unpleasant but still 

00:01:18.430 --> 00:01:27.909
 from need to do that very well 

00:01:20.110 --> 00:01:32.409
 the helmet hardened and I have enough glue for 

00:01:27.909 --> 00:01:36.070
 stickiness add it again and again unless 

00:01:32.409 --> 00:01:40.390
 come from you should get this 

00:01:36.070 --> 00:01:42.670
 here is a mixture of glue and paper and now you need 

00:01:40.390 --> 00:01:44.640
 will add piece by piece 

00:01:42.670 --> 00:01:49.689
 which we told in the past video 

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:52.240
 she is as you see already firmly a little bit 

00:01:49.689 --> 00:01:57.070
 to strengthen it until the end will need 

00:01:52.240 --> 00:02:01.090
 add this this mixture we start 

00:01:57.070 --> 00:02:02.950
 reinforce like this 

00:02:01.090 --> 00:02:08.369
 smooth movements should strengthen 

00:02:02.950 --> 00:02:08.369
 whole helmet or mask or other parts 

00:02:08.950 --> 00:02:15.489
 you should succeed after strengthening 

00:02:11.739 --> 00:02:17.560
 papier mache and this piece you should 

00:02:15.489 --> 00:02:20.920
 will put on the battery and it will 

00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:23.170
 dry about one day you eyes 

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:28.060
 you can do it yourself we made them 

00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:31.630

00:02:28.060 --> 00:02:36.959
