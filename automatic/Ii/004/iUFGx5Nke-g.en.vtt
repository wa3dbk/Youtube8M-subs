00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.140
 Hello youtube and welcome to one 

00:00:01.560 --> 00:00:06.270
 new technique sloth video the iphone 

00:00:04.140 --> 00:00:08.069
 dock of my choice is a former one 

00:00:06.270 --> 00:00:11.849
 kickstarter project and calls itself 

00:00:08.069 --> 00:00:13.200
 elevation dock of innovation labs the 

00:00:11.849 --> 00:00:16.500
 have this from a big chunk 

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:19.170
 at that time still milled with aluminum 

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:20.939
 30 pin connector then there was an update 

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:22.800
 on lightning you could down 

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:25.859
 unscrew and put in your own and 

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:28.890
 now it works the same way with 55 

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:30.210
 and just does not look fancy 

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:31.650
 is also a bit big enough 

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:33.899
 still enough play that is if one also 

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:36.450
 normal cover bumper cases or else 

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:38.219
 what's in it is so different 

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:39.809
 once because of the optics, I always found it 

00:00:38.219 --> 00:00:42.120
 very nice, too, because then I still 

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:45.360
 another home button ran 

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:48.090
 and number one was actually the one 

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:50.340
 uptick but it often has a disadvantage that 

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:51.960
 depending on the earlier with the 30 am not 

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:53.850
 so now with the new lightning ever 

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:56.370
 after how I grab that 

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:59.160
 Same problem as with the plastic box 

00:00:56.370 --> 00:01:01.170
 but it still stands out 

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:03.210
 high unless you get here and there 

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:05.760
 angle make it easy to go there flutscht 

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:08.369
 just so out now have the boys and 

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:11.540
 but girls of elevation are something new 

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:13.740
 thought out this nano 

00:01:11.540 --> 00:01:16.220
 technology that exists more and more 

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:19.320
 it now also as an upgrade for 

00:01:16.220 --> 00:01:21.600
 the equivalent of five euros including shipping 

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:23.909
 pay the fees here in the 

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:27.299
 envelope and in it should be now 

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:30.420
 actually just a moped thing for 

00:01:27.299 --> 00:01:32.729
 be the underground and we slip it 

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:35.210
 and of course we were able to 

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:35.210
 directly to 

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:41.270
 there is already nanocat on it and 

00:01:41.659 --> 00:01:51.200
 that's what the nano page views in 

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:51.200
 Civic office exactly installation 

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:57.659
 I'm looking eight times so you have to 

00:01:55.890 --> 00:02:00.420
 but a guide then it works 

00:01:57.659 --> 00:02:06.149
 even with a technology sloth speak 

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:07.409
 we pull it because there is nothing good sticking there 

00:02:06.149 --> 00:02:10.830
 can ever go to the side 

00:02:07.409 --> 00:02:11.840
 So that's how it is now that's what we do 

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:16.440
 dock up 

00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:21.450
 on the belly pack the fat thing 

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:23.100
 So look at it and look okay 

00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:26.970
 then you can always get there 

00:02:23.100 --> 00:02:30.840
 still very nice on the screws then so 

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:33.800
 that does not mean that yet 

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:40.140
 side but deduct the page 

00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:45.170
 so you're fine and that sticks now 

00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:49.950
 well we try to hit it exactly 

00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:51.840
 once and again I believe though 

00:02:49.950 --> 00:02:53.850
 not that I ever again to this 

00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:55.290
 the screws would like to get that 

00:02:53.850 --> 00:02:57.180
 the'd like slabs or and 

00:02:55.290 --> 00:02:58.530
 shut up again, he opens well 

00:02:57.180 --> 00:03:00.150
 clear when I eventually it easy to 

00:02:58.530 --> 00:03:02.580
 cable exchange if that is broken 

00:03:00.150 --> 00:03:05.150
 then yes, then no matter we have it 

00:03:02.580 --> 00:03:09.410
 now so reasonable it packaged now 

00:03:05.150 --> 00:03:11.730
 the next step comes again 

00:03:09.410 --> 00:03:14.900
 strong press we want to number 

00:03:11.730 --> 00:03:17.760
 certainly not that after that 

00:03:14.900 --> 00:03:19.440
 pad no longer i just that then the only one 

00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:21.120
 double so that sticky thing on the 

00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:28.890
 desk stays behind and not 

00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:31.530
 More now the dock stick and what 

00:03:28.890 --> 00:03:33.450
 now we have these sucked that 

00:03:31.530 --> 00:03:35.250
 I would actually live a little bit 

00:03:33.450 --> 00:03:37.350
 but the glue is still important 

00:03:35.250 --> 00:03:39.299
 stay clean and then I can him 

00:03:37.350 --> 00:03:41.400
 so pack it is not a double-sided 

00:03:39.299 --> 00:03:44.100
 Tape drops that now thinks in there 

00:03:41.400 --> 00:03:46.769
 the theory happens now the following 

00:03:44.100 --> 00:03:54.090
 I can do the trick with it 

00:03:46.769 --> 00:03:55.110
 so and now ha ha we make very nice 

00:03:54.090 --> 00:03:57.269
 it's not quite aryanized right now 

00:03:55.110 --> 00:03:59.160
 I try again and get it 

00:03:57.269 --> 00:04:01.890
 not always the first time iphone out 

00:03:59.160 --> 00:04:05.580
 not that there is something lying around here and this one 

00:04:01.890 --> 00:04:08.810
 mahnung says technology now has the 

00:04:05.580 --> 00:04:10.890
 the order stuck on my desk 

00:04:08.810 --> 00:04:14.310
 Sucked but I get it off again 

00:04:10.890 --> 00:04:15.420
 fax to the next station and still makes 

00:04:14.310 --> 00:04:16.620
 times that he looks a bit more and 

00:04:15.420 --> 00:04:19.290
 Now I'm only walking with two fingers 

00:04:16.620 --> 00:04:21.959
 turn and move from home and moved here 

00:04:19.290 --> 00:04:23.640
 nothing hallelujah but the whole 

00:04:21.959 --> 00:04:24.320
 is not a double-sided adhesive tape 

00:04:23.640 --> 00:04:26.750
 so 

00:04:24.320 --> 00:04:28.640
 This nanoparticle means your job 

00:04:26.750 --> 00:04:31.250
 will now pack everywhere where it like 

00:04:28.640 --> 00:04:33.280
 it was not wet clean is not 

00:04:31.250 --> 00:04:35.090
 Dirty and where the surface 

00:04:33.280 --> 00:04:36.920
 consistently so not where any 

00:04:35.090 --> 00:04:39.170
 porous surfaces are then like that 

00:04:36.920 --> 00:04:42.020
 So little or so , who are you? 

00:04:39.170 --> 00:04:44.570
 dock is wonderful here is your solution 

00:04:42.020 --> 00:04:46.580
 if you previously double-sided 

00:04:44.570 --> 00:04:48.860
 tape or something has used there are 

00:04:46.580 --> 00:04:51.080
 Now with nanotechnology upgrade 

00:04:48.860 --> 00:04:52.850
 and I'm blown away 

00:04:51.080 --> 00:04:56.200
 Thanks for watching it makes it good 

00:04:52.850 --> 00:04:56.200
 and until the next video
