00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:20.400 
stuff I used for all these tendrils ie

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:23.120 
stuff I used for all these tendrils ie
just<00:01:21.299> kind<00:01:21.479> of<00:01:21.540> put<00:01:21.960> all<00:01:22.140> around<00:01:22.470> to<00:01:22.890> kind<00:01:23.040> of

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:25.770 
give a nice textured effect on the sides

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:28.850 
give a nice textured effect on the sides
their<00:01:26.240> sides<00:01:27.240> on<00:01:27.450> top<00:01:27.630> and<00:01:27.930> yeah<00:01:28.590> all<00:01:28.770> these

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:28.860 
their sides on top and yeah all these

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:30.530 
their sides on top and yeah all these
tendrils<00:01:29.310> are<00:01:29.520> they're<00:01:29.880> basically<00:01:30.119> just<00:01:30.270> wire

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:30.540 
tendrils are they're basically just wire

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:33.980 
tendrils are they're basically just wire
with<00:01:31.170> thumb<00:01:31.520> that's<00:01:32.520> a<00:01:32.850> plastic<00:01:33.540> coating<00:01:33.659> so

00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:33.990 
with thumb that's a plastic coating so

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:37.160 
with thumb that's a plastic coating so
they<00:01:34.170> are<00:01:34.790> completely<00:01:35.790> 100%<00:01:36.119> poseable<00:01:36.960> and

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:37.170 
they are completely 100% poseable and

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:40.539 
they are completely 100% poseable and
like<00:01:38.040> any<00:01:38.280> way<00:01:38.490> you<00:01:38.549> could<00:01:39.060> possibly<00:01:39.210> imagine

00:01:40.539 --> 00:01:40.549 
like any way you could possibly imagine

00:01:40.549 --> 00:01:43.130 
like any way you could possibly imagine
so<00:01:41.549> it's<00:01:41.759> super<00:01:42.090> fun<00:01:42.270> to<00:01:42.360> play<00:01:42.540> with<00:01:42.689> and<00:01:42.899> just

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:43.140 
so it's super fun to play with and just

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:46.639 
so it's super fun to play with and just
get<00:01:43.530> those<00:01:43.710> and<00:01:43.979> posing<00:01:44.640> poses<00:01:45.119> but<00:01:46.020> I<00:01:46.049> want<00:01:46.560> to

00:01:46.639 --> 00:01:46.649 
get those and posing poses but I want to

00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:48.920 
get those and posing poses but I want to
go<00:01:46.710> ahead<00:01:46.770> and<00:01:46.860> transform<00:01:47.490> moose<00:01:47.909> which<00:01:48.540> is<00:01:48.750> um

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:48.930 
go ahead and transform moose which is um

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:51.010 
go ahead and transform moose which is um
super<00:01:49.649> easy<00:01:49.860> because

00:01:51.010 --> 00:01:51.020 
super easy because

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:53.870 
super easy because
vehicons<00:01:52.020> transformation<00:01:52.710> was<00:01:52.920> this<00:01:53.549> super

00:01:53.870 --> 00:01:53.880 
vehicons transformation was this super

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:57.950 
vehicons transformation was this super
super<00:01:54.680> simple<00:01:55.680> and<00:01:55.950> also<00:01:56.340> very<00:01:56.759> clever<00:01:57.119> I<00:01:57.420> love

00:01:57.950 --> 00:01:57.960 
super simple and also very clever I love

00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:04.280 
super simple and also very clever I love
the<00:01:58.259> original<00:01:58.350> transformation<00:02:02.810> but<00:02:03.810> I'm<00:02:04.049> sure

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:04.290 
the original transformation but I'm sure

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:05.510 
the original transformation but I'm sure
you've<00:02:04.439> heard<00:02:04.530> plenty<00:02:04.770> about<00:02:04.920> that<00:02:05.250> know<00:02:05.490> all

00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:05.520 
you've heard plenty about that know all

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:07.580 
you've heard plenty about that know all
about<00:02:05.759> that<00:02:05.909> because<00:02:06.509> this<00:02:06.689> figures<00:02:07.229> been<00:02:07.439> out

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:07.590 
about that because this figures been out

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:10.100 
about that because this figures been out
for<00:02:07.799> like<00:02:07.950> a<00:02:08.160> year<00:02:08.310> and<00:02:08.729> a<00:02:09.090> half<00:02:09.300> two<00:02:09.810> years

00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:10.110 
for like a year and a half two years

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:11.530 
for like a year and a half two years
something<00:02:10.649> like<00:02:10.800> that

00:02:11.530 --> 00:02:11.540 
something like that

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:19.949 
something like that
so<00:02:12.500> not<00:02:13.010> exactly<00:02:13.099> a<00:02:13.430> new<00:02:13.580> figure<00:02:16.810> you<00:02:17.810> know<00:02:17.870> and

00:02:19.949 --> 00:02:19.959 
so not exactly a new figure you know and

00:03:48.220 --> 00:03:48.230 
to call this guy back on it's not a very

00:03:48.230 --> 00:03:52.000 
to call this guy back on it's not a very
original<00:03:48.379> name<00:03:48.769> honestly<00:03:50.290> but<00:03:51.290> some<00:03:51.590> I<00:03:51.949> think

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:52.010 
original name honestly but some I think

00:03:52.010 --> 00:03:58.809 
original name honestly but some I think
it<00:03:52.370> fits<00:03:52.669> for<00:03:52.940> now<00:03:53.650> and<00:03:56.349> yeah<00:03:57.349> so<00:03:57.769> what's<00:03:58.579> a

00:03:58.809 --> 00:03:58.819 
it fits for now and yeah so what's a

00:03:58.819 --> 00:04:00.699 
it fits for now and yeah so what's a
venom<00:03:59.299> figure<00:03:59.629> wouldn't<00:03:59.959> be<00:04:00.199> complete

00:04:00.699 --> 00:04:00.709 
venom figure wouldn't be complete

00:04:00.709 --> 00:04:03.520 
venom figure wouldn't be complete
without<00:04:01.180> some<00:04:02.180> sort<00:04:02.419> of<00:04:02.599> tongue<00:04:02.900> which

00:04:03.520 --> 00:04:03.530 
without some sort of tongue which

00:04:03.530 --> 00:04:05.500 
without some sort of tongue which
basically<00:04:04.310> is<00:04:04.489> a<00:04:04.579> removable<00:04:04.970> piece<00:04:05.209> here

00:04:05.500 --> 00:04:05.510 
basically is a removable piece here

00:04:05.510 --> 00:04:08.110 
basically is a removable piece here
because<00:04:05.949> it's<00:04:06.949> pretty<00:04:07.340> big<00:04:07.609> and<00:04:07.819> won't<00:04:07.970> really

00:04:08.110 --> 00:04:08.120 
because it's pretty big and won't really

00:04:08.120 --> 00:04:09.939 
because it's pretty big and won't really
fit<00:04:08.359> in<00:04:08.510> there<00:04:08.720> that<00:04:09.319> we're<00:04:09.470> permanently

00:04:09.939 --> 00:04:09.949 
fit in there that we're permanently

00:04:09.949 --> 00:04:13.479 
fit in there that we're permanently
attached<00:04:10.250> to<00:04:10.489> them<00:04:10.780> but<00:04:11.780> there<00:04:12.709> is<00:04:12.919> a<00:04:12.949> little

00:04:13.479 --> 00:04:13.489 
attached to them but there is a little

00:04:13.489 --> 00:04:15.449 
attached to them but there is a little
tiny<00:04:13.639> wire<00:04:13.909> there<00:04:14.299> on<00:04:14.510> the<00:04:14.690> other<00:04:14.810> side<00:04:15.079> and

00:04:15.449 --> 00:04:15.459 
tiny wire there on the other side and

00:04:15.459 --> 00:04:17.529 
tiny wire there on the other side and
you<00:04:16.459> can't<00:04:16.699> really<00:04:16.880> see<00:04:17.060> it<00:04:17.180> because<00:04:17.239> while

00:04:17.529 --> 00:04:17.539 
you can't really see it because while

00:04:17.539 --> 00:04:20.500 
you can't really see it because while
the<00:04:17.599> black<00:04:17.810> paint<00:04:18.109> but<00:04:18.560> there<00:04:18.829> is<00:04:19.310> just<00:04:19.820> very

00:04:20.500 --> 00:04:20.510 
the black paint but there is just very

00:04:20.510 --> 00:04:22.830

kind of insert it into this will push

00:04:26.260 --> 00:04:30.810 
kind of insert it into this will push

place<00:04:32.560> aside<00:04:33.220> from<00:04:33.370> just<00:04:33.490> the<00:04:33.610> generic

00:04:33.930 --> 00:04:33.940 
place aside from just the generic

00:04:33.940 --> 00:04:35.969 
place aside from just the generic
sculpting<00:04:34.449> and<00:04:34.660> yeah<00:04:35.139> the<00:04:35.560> tongue<00:04:35.710> sticking

00:04:35.969 --> 00:04:35.979 
sculpting and yeah the tongue sticking

00:04:35.979 --> 00:04:37.710 
sculpting and yeah the tongue sticking
straight<00:04:36.250> out<00:04:36.310> that's<00:04:36.910> kind<00:04:37.210> of<00:04:37.240> lame<00:04:37.449> so

00:04:37.710 --> 00:04:37.720 
straight out that's kind of lame so

00:04:37.720 --> 00:04:40.730 
straight out that's kind of lame so
let's<00:04:37.930> give<00:04:38.919> this<00:04:39.100> thing<00:04:39.310> a<00:04:39.370> nice<00:04:39.580> little

00:04:40.730 --> 00:04:40.740 
let's give this thing a nice little

00:04:40.740 --> 00:04:50.879 
let's give this thing a nice little
little<00:04:41.740> twist<00:04:42.130> there<00:04:44.100> there<00:04:45.100> we<00:04:45.370> go<00:04:49.710> so<00:04:50.710> how's

00:04:50.879 --> 00:04:50.889 
little twist there there we go so how's

00:04:50.889 --> 00:04:52.770 
little twist there there we go so how's
that<00:04:51.220> for<00:04:51.280> venom<00:04:51.820> oh<00:04:51.940> my<00:04:52.150> god<00:04:52.389> that<00:04:52.570> tom<00:04:52.750> is

00:04:52.770 --> 00:04:52.780 
that for venom oh my god that tom is

00:04:52.780 --> 00:04:55.590 
that for venom oh my god that tom is
followed<00:04:53.380> by<00:04:53.699> Here<00:04:54.699> I<00:04:54.729> am<00:04:54.850> saying<00:04:55.300> it's<00:04:55.450> going

00:04:55.590 --> 00:04:55.600 
followed by Here I am saying it's going

00:04:55.600 --> 00:04:57.060 
followed by Here I am saying it's going
to<00:04:55.660> stay<00:04:55.900> in<00:04:55.930> place<00:04:56.139> perfectly<00:04:56.620> fine<00:04:56.800> it's

00:04:57.060 --> 00:04:57.070 
to stay in place perfectly fine it's

00:04:57.070 --> 00:04:59.430 
to stay in place perfectly fine it's
falling<00:04:57.610> out<00:04:57.700> I<00:04:58.000> might<00:04:58.690> need<00:04:58.870> to<00:04:58.930> work<00:04:59.139> on<00:04:59.290> that

00:04:59.430 --> 00:04:59.440 
falling out I might need to work on that

00:04:59.440 --> 00:05:00.900 
falling out I might need to work on that
just<00:04:59.620> a<00:04:59.680> tad<00:04:59.919> more<00:05:00.220> to<00:05:00.310> make<00:05:00.460> sure<00:05:00.610> that<00:05:00.790> it

00:05:00.900 --> 00:05:00.910 
just a tad more to make sure that it

00:05:00.910 --> 00:05:03.990 
just a tad more to make sure that it
doesn't<00:05:01.090> have<00:05:01.270> any<00:05:01.419> issues<00:05:01.950> but<00:05:02.950> uh<00:05:02.979> yeah<00:05:03.639> and

00:05:03.990 --> 00:05:04.000 
doesn't have any issues but uh yeah and

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:06.270 
doesn't have any issues but uh yeah and
so<00:05:04.570> at<00:05:04.720> this<00:05:04.810> point<00:05:05.080> I<00:05:05.229> was<00:05:05.350> like<00:05:05.530> oh<00:05:05.710> man<00:05:05.979> I<00:05:06.130> had

00:05:06.270 --> 00:05:06.280 
so at this point I was like oh man I had

00:05:06.280 --> 00:05:08.310 
so at this point I was like oh man I had
that<00:05:06.430> I<00:05:06.460> mean<00:05:06.610> that<00:05:06.639> as<00:05:07.060> is<00:05:07.330> is<00:05:07.570> just<00:05:07.810> so<00:05:08.020> cool

00:05:08.310 --> 00:05:08.320 
that I mean that as is is just so cool

00:05:08.320 --> 00:05:10.950 
that I mean that as is is just so cool
but<00:05:09.160> you<00:05:09.430> know<00:05:09.550> I<00:05:09.580> don't<00:05:10.540> want<00:05:10.660> to<00:05:10.720> give<00:05:10.810> them<00:05:10.900> a

00:05:10.950 --> 00:05:10.960 
but you know I don't want to give them a

00:05:10.960 --> 00:05:13.409 
but you know I don't want to give them a
little<00:05:11.139> bit<00:05:11.229> more<00:05:11.639> was<00:05:12.639> the<00:05:12.729> only<00:05:12.880> no<00:05:13.060> tendrils

00:05:13.409 --> 00:05:13.419 
little bit more was the only no tendrils

00:05:13.419 --> 00:05:15.330 
little bit more was the only no tendrils
of<00:05:13.479> the<00:05:13.570> arms<00:05:13.930> or<00:05:14.110> something<00:05:14.470> but<00:05:15.190> I<00:05:15.220> couldn't

00:05:15.330 --> 00:05:15.340 
of the arms or something but I couldn't

00:05:15.340 --> 00:05:17.400 
of the arms or something but I couldn't
do<00:05:15.580> much<00:05:15.669> more<00:05:15.940> at<00:05:16.000> the<00:05:16.030> hands<00:05:16.600> and<00:05:17.080> it<00:05:17.260> really

00:05:17.400 --> 00:05:17.410 
do much more at the hands and it really

00:05:17.410 --> 00:05:19.610 
do much more at the hands and it really
like<00:05:17.620> the<00:05:17.800> original<00:05:17.889> vehicon<00:05:18.490> gun<00:05:18.729> with<00:05:19.000> them

00:05:19.610 --> 00:05:19.620 
like the original vehicon gun with them

00:05:19.620 --> 00:05:22.700 
like the original vehicon gun with them
so<00:05:20.620> I<00:05:20.650> ended<00:05:21.070> up<00:05:21.190> making<00:05:21.250> these<00:05:21.729> little<00:05:22.120> hand

00:05:22.700 --> 00:05:22.710 
so I ended up making these little hand

00:05:22.710 --> 00:05:27.029 
so I ended up making these little hand
attachments<00:05:23.710> that<00:05:25.380> just<00:05:26.380> kind<00:05:26.620> of<00:05:26.650> go<00:05:26.800> around

00:05:27.029 --> 00:05:27.039 
attachments that just kind of go around

00:05:27.039 --> 00:05:30.659 
attachments that just kind of go around
his<00:05:27.580> existing<00:05:28.030> hands<00:05:28.450> and<00:05:28.630> um<00:05:29.320> just<00:05:29.669> because

00:05:30.659 --> 00:05:30.669 
his existing hands and um just because

00:05:30.669 --> 00:05:34.350 
his existing hands and um just because
they're<00:05:31.570> the<00:05:32.500> material<00:05:32.979> is<00:05:33.340> basically<00:05:34.120> like

00:05:34.350 --> 00:05:34.360 
they're the material is basically like

00:05:34.360 --> 00:05:37.020 
they're the material is basically like
that<00:05:34.539> rubber<00:05:35.130> rubber<00:05:36.130> on<00:05:36.340> rubber<00:05:36.370> kind<00:05:36.970> of

00:05:37.020 --> 00:05:37.030 
that rubber rubber on rubber kind of

00:05:37.030 --> 00:05:38.969 
that rubber rubber on rubber kind of
thing<00:05:37.150> it's<00:05:37.389> they<00:05:37.870> they<00:05:38.139> grip<00:05:38.440> each<00:05:38.560> other

00:05:38.969 --> 00:05:38.979 
thing it's they they grip each other

00:05:38.979 --> 00:05:43.230 
thing it's they they grip each other
very<00:05:39.460> very<00:05:40.419> well<00:05:41.280> so<00:05:42.280> getting<00:05:42.490> them<00:05:42.700> on<00:05:42.910> there

00:05:43.230 --> 00:05:43.240 
very very well so getting them on there

00:05:43.240 --> 00:05:46.710 
very very well so getting them on there
is<00:05:43.450> a<00:05:44.080> little<00:05:44.680> tricky<00:05:45.360> but<00:05:46.360> once<00:05:46.479> they're<00:05:46.690> on

00:05:46.710 --> 00:05:46.720 
is a little tricky but once they're on

00:05:46.720 --> 00:05:48.300 
is a little tricky but once they're on
there<00:05:47.020> because<00:05:47.200> it's<00:05:47.590> rubber<00:05:47.919> gripping

00:05:48.300 --> 00:05:48.310 
there because it's rubber gripping

00:05:48.310 --> 00:05:51.089 
there because it's rubber gripping
rubber<00:05:48.520> they<00:05:49.110> they<00:05:50.110> don't<00:05:50.229> they<00:05:50.710> don't<00:05:50.950> really

00:05:51.089 --> 00:05:51.099 
rubber they they don't they don't really

00:05:51.099 --> 00:05:52.670 
rubber they they don't they don't really
have<00:05:51.340> they're<00:05:51.669> not<00:05:51.700> going<00:05:51.910> to<00:05:51.970> fall<00:05:52.150> off

00:05:52.670 --> 00:05:52.680 
have they're not going to fall off

00:05:52.680 --> 00:05:56.430 
have they're not going to fall off
these<00:05:53.680> massive<00:05:54.520> hand<00:05:55.060> additions<00:05:55.599> aren't

00:05:56.430 --> 00:05:56.440 
these massive hand additions aren't

00:05:56.440 --> 00:06:00.690 
these massive hand additions aren't
going<00:05:56.590> to<00:05:56.650> fall<00:05:56.770> off<00:05:57.930> and<00:05:59.340> basically<00:06:00.340> the<00:06:00.490> best

00:06:00.690 --> 00:06:00.700 
going to fall off and basically the best

00:06:00.700 --> 00:06:01.920 
going to fall off and basically the best
way<00:06:00.910> to<00:06:00.940> be<00:06:01.090> able<00:06:01.150> to<00:06:01.300> tell<00:06:01.510> that<00:06:01.630> they're<00:06:01.780> on

00:06:01.920 --> 00:06:01.930 
way to be able to tell that they're on

00:06:01.930 --> 00:06:04.170 
way to be able to tell that they're on
there<00:06:02.139> correctly<00:06:02.560> is<00:06:02.950> that<00:06:02.979> so<00:06:03.639> the<00:06:03.820> original

00:06:04.170 --> 00:06:04.180 
there correctly is that so the original

00:06:04.180 --> 00:06:06.480 
there correctly is that so the original
thumb<00:06:04.479> is<00:06:04.780> about<00:06:04.840> pretty<00:06:05.740> much<00:06:05.889> dead<00:06:06.160> center

00:06:06.480 --> 00:06:06.490 
thumb is about pretty much dead center

00:06:06.490 --> 00:06:09.750 
thumb is about pretty much dead center
with<00:06:06.700> what's<00:06:07.360> around<00:06:07.479> there<00:06:08.020> I<00:06:08.550> see<00:06:09.550> that<00:06:09.669> on

00:06:09.750 --> 00:06:09.760 
with what's around there I see that on

00:06:09.760 --> 00:06:11.690 
with what's around there I see that on
both<00:06:09.820> of<00:06:10.120> them<00:06:10.410> yeah

00:06:11.690 --> 00:06:11.700 
both of them yeah

00:06:11.700 --> 00:06:15.150 
both of them yeah
and<00:06:12.700> so<00:06:13.360> yeah<00:06:13.960> now<00:06:14.260> he<00:06:14.320> has<00:06:14.680> these<00:06:14.860> bigger

00:06:15.150 --> 00:06:15.160 
and so yeah now he has these bigger

00:06:15.160 --> 00:06:18.360 
and so yeah now he has these bigger
massive<00:06:15.910> claw<00:06:16.570> hands<00:06:17.410> they're<00:06:17.979> super

00:06:18.360 --> 00:06:18.370 
massive claw hands they're super

00:06:18.370 --> 00:06:20.790 
massive claw hands they're super
imposing<00:06:18.849> with<00:06:19.000> additional<00:06:19.630> tendrils<00:06:20.200> they

00:06:20.790 --> 00:06:20.800 
imposing with additional tendrils they

00:06:20.800 --> 00:06:23.219 
imposing with additional tendrils they
can<00:06:20.950> like<00:06:21.160> again<00:06:22.000> also<00:06:22.270> fully<00:06:22.630> poseable<00:06:23.110> they

00:06:23.219 --> 00:06:23.229 
can like again also fully poseable they

00:06:23.229 --> 00:06:24.450 
can like again also fully poseable they
can<00:06:23.380> give<00:06:23.530> them<00:06:23.650> all<00:06:23.770> kinds<00:06:24.039> of<00:06:24.099> crazy<00:06:24.340> things

00:06:24.450 --> 00:06:24.460 
can give them all kinds of crazy things

00:06:24.460 --> 00:06:26.730 
can give them all kinds of crazy things
you<00:06:25.240> know<00:06:25.300> wrap<00:06:25.570> around<00:06:25.870> a<00:06:25.960> victim<00:06:26.320> that<00:06:26.349> kind

00:06:26.730 --> 00:06:26.740 
you know wrap around a victim that kind

00:06:26.740 --> 00:06:30.210 
you know wrap around a victim that kind
of<00:06:26.800> thing<00:06:26.979> and<00:06:28.020> what's<00:06:29.020> even<00:06:29.110> cooler<00:06:29.380> is<00:06:29.560> the

00:06:30.210 --> 00:06:30.220 
of thing and what's even cooler is the

00:06:30.220 --> 00:06:33.060 
of thing and what's even cooler is the
actual<00:06:30.490> fingers<00:06:30.940> are<00:06:31.630> also<00:06:31.960> wire<00:06:32.320> just<00:06:32.710> a<00:06:32.830> lot

00:06:33.060 --> 00:06:33.070 
actual fingers are also wire just a lot

00:06:33.070 --> 00:06:35.580 
actual fingers are also wire just a lot
thicker<00:06:33.340> wire<00:06:33.640> so<00:06:34.000> they<00:06:34.240> are<00:06:34.590> basically
