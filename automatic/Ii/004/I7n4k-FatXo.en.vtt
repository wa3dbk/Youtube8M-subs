00:00:05.650 --> 00:00:05.660 
well i got my turbo back i guess the

00:00:05.660 --> 00:00:08.340 
well i got my turbo back i guess the
problem<00:00:05.899> that<00:00:06.259> they<00:00:06.560> found<00:00:06.830> was<00:00:07.190> this<00:00:07.819> back

00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:08.350 
problem that they found was this back

00:00:08.350 --> 00:00:13.660 
problem that they found was this back
exhaust<00:00:11.770> impaler<00:00:12.770> vein<00:00:13.130> whatever<00:00:13.460> you<00:00:13.520> want

00:00:13.660 --> 00:00:13.670

00:00:13.670 --> 00:00:15.010 
exhaust impaler vein whatever you want
to<00:00:13.760> call<00:00:13.910> it<00:00:13.970> i<00:00:14.240> guess<00:00:14.420> had<00:00:14.660> a<00:00:14.690> little

00:00:15.010 --> 00:00:15.020 
to call it i guess had a little

00:00:15.020 --> 00:00:17.320 
to call it i guess had a little
excessive<00:00:16.010> contacts<00:00:16.670> i<00:00:16.820> took<00:00:17.000> a<00:00:17.090> little<00:00:17.210> bit

00:00:17.320 --> 00:00:17.330 
excessive contacts i took a little bit

00:00:17.330 --> 00:00:19.990 
excessive contacts i took a little bit
of<00:00:17.390> meat<00:00:17.660> out<00:00:17.900> of<00:00:17.960> the<00:00:18.400> the<00:00:19.400> inside<00:00:19.790> of<00:00:19.820> the

00:00:19.990 --> 00:00:20.000 
of meat out of the the inside of the

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:22.810 
of meat out of the the inside of the
cylinder<00:00:20.240> here<00:00:20.720> you<00:00:21.530> can<00:00:21.710> see<00:00:21.920> they<00:00:22.070> actually

00:00:22.810 --> 00:00:22.820 
cylinder here you can see they actually

00:00:22.820 --> 00:00:24.580 
cylinder here you can see they actually
kind<00:00:23.060> of<00:00:23.090> cut<00:00:23.420> a<00:00:23.630> little<00:00:23.810> bit<00:00:23.990> of<00:00:24.050> a<00:00:24.140> groove<00:00:24.410> in

00:00:24.580 --> 00:00:24.590 
kind of cut a little bit of a groove in

00:00:24.590 --> 00:00:26.740 
kind of cut a little bit of a groove in
there<00:00:24.830> give<00:00:25.789> a<00:00:25.820> little<00:00:26.000> more<00:00:26.119> clearance<00:00:26.480> i

00:00:26.740 --> 00:00:26.750 
there give a little more clearance i

00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:33.060 
there give a little more clearance i
guess<00:00:27.020> and<00:00:28.119> i<00:00:29.650> guess<00:00:30.650> they<00:00:31.329> renounced<00:00:32.329> the

00:00:33.060 --> 00:00:33.070 
guess and i guess they renounced the

00:00:33.070 --> 00:00:37.360 
guess and i guess they renounced the
turbine<00:00:34.070> blade<00:00:34.340> here<00:00:34.610> too<00:00:34.850> i<00:00:34.910> guess<00:00:35.239> so<00:00:36.370> should

00:00:37.360 --> 00:00:37.370 
turbine blade here too i guess so should

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:39.490 
turbine blade here too i guess so should
be<00:00:37.460> good<00:00:37.579> to<00:00:37.640> go<00:00:37.790> the<00:00:38.570> parts<00:00:38.960> that<00:00:39.050> they<00:00:39.170> pull

00:00:39.490 --> 00:00:39.500 
be good to go the parts that they pull

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:43.560 
be good to go the parts that they pull
off<00:00:39.800> of<00:00:40.040> it<00:00:40.160> here<00:00:40.399> it's<00:00:41.030> a<00:00:41.120> seal<00:00:41.600> and<00:00:41.930> a<00:00:42.470> bearing

00:00:43.560 --> 00:00:43.570 
off of it here it's a seal and a bearing

00:00:43.570 --> 00:00:47.380 
off of it here it's a seal and a bearing
basically<00:00:44.620> some<00:00:45.620> off<00:00:45.770> the<00:00:45.800> carbon<00:00:46.340> dub<00:00:46.550> so<00:00:47.149> it

00:00:47.380 --> 00:00:47.390 
basically some off the carbon dub so it

00:00:47.390 --> 00:00:50.410 
basically some off the carbon dub so it
kind<00:00:47.630> of<00:00:47.660> makes<00:00:47.809> me<00:00:48.020> think<00:00:48.290> I<00:00:48.850> don't<00:00:49.850> know<00:00:49.940> kind

00:00:50.410 --> 00:00:50.420 
kind of makes me think I don't know kind

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:52.330 
kind of makes me think I don't know kind
of<00:00:50.480> scary<00:00:50.750> compared<00:00:51.649> to<00:00:51.680> the<00:00:51.800> other<00:00:51.920> one<00:00:52.130> which

00:00:52.330 --> 00:00:52.340 
of scary compared to the other one which

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:56.020 
of scary compared to the other one which
is<00:00:52.489> just<00:00:52.610> really<00:00:53.390> nice<00:00:53.570> and<00:00:53.870> clean<00:00:54.140> and<00:00:55.030> then

00:00:56.020 --> 00:00:56.030 
is just really nice and clean and then

00:00:56.030 --> 00:00:58.290 
is just really nice and clean and then
some<00:00:56.390> want<00:00:56.570> to<00:00:56.630> do<00:00:56.750> this<00:00:56.870> is<00:00:57.140> the<00:00:57.260> shaft<00:00:57.530> seal<00:00:57.890> I

00:00:58.290 --> 00:00:58.300 
some want to do this is the shaft seal I

00:00:58.300 --> 00:01:02.139 
some want to do this is the shaft seal I
think<00:00:59.300> that<00:00:59.570> was<00:00:59.750> leaking<00:01:00.170> so<00:01:00.879> they<00:01:01.879> got<00:01:02.059> the

00:01:02.139 --> 00:01:02.149 
think that was leaking so they got the

00:01:02.149 --> 00:01:03.610 
think that was leaking so they got the
peace<00:01:02.300> of<00:01:02.329> mind<00:01:02.510> that<00:01:02.870> at<00:01:03.170> least<00:01:03.290> this<00:01:03.469> has

00:01:03.610 --> 00:01:03.620 
peace of mind that at least this has

00:01:03.620 --> 00:01:05.289 
peace of mind that at least this has
been<00:01:03.710> taken<00:01:04.100> care<00:01:04.280> of<00:01:04.339> and<00:01:04.549> kind<00:01:04.909> of<00:01:04.999> to<00:01:05.119> go

00:01:05.289 --> 00:01:05.299 
been taken care of and kind of to go

00:01:05.299 --> 00:01:09.699 
been taken care of and kind of to go
from<00:01:05.539> there<00:01:05.749> I<00:01:06.670> had<00:01:07.670> to<00:01:07.789> cut<00:01:08.090> some<00:01:08.329> gaskets<00:01:08.929> one

00:01:09.699 --> 00:01:09.709 
from there I had to cut some gaskets one

00:01:09.709 --> 00:01:12.059 
from there I had to cut some gaskets one
for<00:01:09.920> the<00:01:09.979> feed<00:01:10.249> line<00:01:10.459> flange<00:01:10.939> and<00:01:11.270> then

00:01:12.059 --> 00:01:12.069 
for the feed line flange and then

00:01:12.069 --> 00:01:16.330 
for the feed line flange and then
another<00:01:13.069> one<00:01:13.399> for<00:01:13.969> the<00:01:14.799> outlet<00:01:15.799> or<00:01:15.920> the<00:01:16.009> drain

00:01:16.330 --> 00:01:16.340 
another one for the outlet or the drain

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:18.519 
another one for the outlet or the drain
out<00:01:16.579> of<00:01:16.670> the<00:01:16.759> turbo<00:01:17.149> and<00:01:17.329> I've<00:01:17.479> actually<00:01:18.139> taken

00:01:18.519 --> 00:01:18.529 
out of the turbo and I've actually taken

out of the turbo and I've actually taken
the<00:01:19.119> the<00:01:20.119> 90<00:01:20.600> here<00:01:21.999> which<00:01:22.999> used<00:01:23.749> to<00:01:23.899> have<00:01:25.090> this

00:01:27.029 --> 00:01:27.039

00:01:45.760 --> 00:01:45.770 
it is I came up with this piece off of

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:48.519 
it is I came up with this piece off of
the<00:01:46.399> old<00:01:46.579> turbo<00:01:46.909> off<00:01:47.329> the<00:01:47.479> old<00:01:47.779> twin<00:01:48.049> turbos

00:01:48.519 --> 00:01:48.529 
the old turbo off the old twin turbos

00:01:48.529 --> 00:01:50.980 
the old turbo off the old twin turbos
which<00:01:49.399> I'll<00:01:49.579> show<00:01:49.729> you<00:01:49.759> right<00:01:49.999> now<00:01:50.240> this<00:01:50.810> is

which I'll show you right now this is
the<00:01:51.020> old<00:01:51.229> twin<00:01:51.649> arrangement<00:01:52.279> and<00:01:52.429> you<00:01:53.419> can

00:01:53.559 --> 00:01:53.569 
the old twin arrangement and you can

00:01:53.569 --> 00:01:57.309 
the old twin arrangement and you can
basically<00:01:53.749> see<00:01:54.369> bottom<00:01:55.369> side<00:01:55.669> over<00:01:56.029> here<00:01:56.319> the

00:01:57.309 --> 00:01:57.319 
basically see bottom side over here the

00:01:57.319 --> 00:02:00.729 
basically see bottom side over here the
drain<00:01:57.649> on<00:01:57.889> this<00:01:58.219> one<00:01:58.429> right<00:01:58.639> here<00:01:59.529> there's<00:02:00.529> two

00:02:00.729 --> 00:02:00.739 
drain on this one right here there's two

00:02:00.739 --> 00:02:02.080 
drain on this one right here there's two
of<00:02:00.770> them<00:02:00.889> obviously<00:02:01.219> because<00:02:01.549> it's<00:02:01.759> a<00:02:01.849> twin

00:02:02.080 --> 00:02:02.090 
of them obviously because it's a twin

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:07.839 
of them obviously because it's a twin
turbo<00:02:05.020> basically<00:02:06.020> what<00:02:06.139> I<00:02:06.169> did<00:02:06.289> is<00:02:06.669> this<00:02:07.669> is

turbo basically what I did is this is

00:02:07.849 --> 00:02:09.249 
turbo basically what I did is this is
the<00:02:08.090> other<00:02:08.149> one<00:02:08.360> that<00:02:08.509> came<00:02:08.690> off<00:02:08.750> the<00:02:09.110> other

the other one that came off the other

00:02:09.259 --> 00:02:12.700 
the other one that came off the other
side<00:02:09.590> right<00:02:10.310> here<00:02:10.900> it's<00:02:11.900> got<00:02:12.080> this<00:02:12.230> nice<00:02:12.440> heat

00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:12.710 
side right here it's got this nice heat

00:02:12.710 --> 00:02:13.809 
side right here it's got this nice heat
shield<00:02:13.040> on<00:02:13.190> the<00:02:13.220> other<00:02:13.460> one<00:02:13.580> did

shield on the other one did

00:02:13.819 --> 00:02:16.929 
shield on the other one did
have<00:02:14.120> the<00:02:14.269> heat<00:02:14.450> shield<00:02:14.480> on<00:02:14.989> it<00:02:15.609> but<00:02:16.609> I<00:02:16.640> can

00:02:16.929 --> 00:02:16.939 
have the heat shield on it but I can

00:02:16.939 --> 00:02:18.459 
have the heat shield on it but I can
just<00:02:17.090> assume<00:02:17.359> if<00:02:17.510> I<00:02:17.629> take<00:02:17.840> this<00:02:17.959> heat<00:02:18.170> shield

00:02:18.459 --> 00:02:18.469 
just assume if I take this heat shield

00:02:18.469 --> 00:02:19.780 
just assume if I take this heat shield
off<00:02:18.620> to<00:02:18.799> look<00:02:19.010> like<00:02:19.189> the<00:02:19.340> other<00:02:19.459> one<00:02:19.639> this

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:19.790 
off to look like the other one this

00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:21.280 
off to look like the other one this
one's<00:02:19.999> kind<00:02:20.239> of<00:02:20.299> patent<00:02:20.719> more<00:02:20.989> of<00:02:21.079> an<00:02:21.170> angle

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:21.290 
one's kind of patent more of an angle

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:22.569 
one's kind of patent more of an angle
that<00:02:21.560> didn't<00:02:21.829> look<00:02:21.889> like<00:02:21.950> it<00:02:22.069> was<00:02:22.189> going<00:02:22.340> to<00:02:22.430> be

00:02:22.569 --> 00:02:22.579 
that didn't look like it was going to be

00:02:22.579 --> 00:02:24.539 
that didn't look like it was going to be
right<00:02:22.849> for<00:02:23.299> what<00:02:23.420> I<00:02:23.450> wanted<00:02:23.540> to<00:02:23.840> do<00:02:23.989> with<00:02:24.170> it

00:02:24.539 --> 00:02:24.549 
right for what I wanted to do with it

00:02:24.549 --> 00:02:29.190 
right for what I wanted to do with it
all<00:02:25.549> right<00:02:25.819> here's<00:02:26.150> the<00:02:26.269> twin<00:02:27.079> arrangement

00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:29.200 
all right here's the twin arrangement

00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:32.530 
all right here's the twin arrangement
you<00:02:30.200> can<00:02:30.349> see<00:02:30.560> that<00:02:30.790> it's<00:02:31.790> really<00:02:32.180> not<00:02:32.359> a<00:02:32.420> very

00:02:32.530 --> 00:02:32.540 
you can see that it's really not a very

00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:36.640 
you can see that it's really not a very
large<00:02:34.060> turbo<00:02:35.060> and<00:02:35.299> not<00:02:35.480> really<00:02:35.750> even<00:02:35.930> a<00:02:36.019> very

00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:36.650 
large turbo and not really even a very

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:42.190 
large turbo and not really even a very
aggressive<00:02:37.040> looking<00:02:40.540> turbine<00:02:41.540> blade<00:02:41.900> either

00:02:42.190 --> 00:02:42.200 
aggressive looking turbine blade either

00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:45.190 
aggressive looking turbine blade either
really<00:02:42.409> think<00:02:43.310> about<00:02:43.400> it<00:02:44.019> comparison<00:02:45.019> to<00:02:45.049> the

00:02:45.190 --> 00:02:45.200 
really think about it comparison to the

00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:50.520 
really think about it comparison to the
greddy<00:02:47.799> but<00:02:48.799> this<00:02:49.069> thing<00:02:49.280> still<00:02:49.519> did<00:02:49.700> work<00:02:49.909> I

00:02:50.520 --> 00:02:50.530 
greddy but this thing still did work I

00:02:50.530 --> 00:02:52.839 
greddy but this thing still did work I
have<00:02:51.530> a<00:02:51.590> hard<00:02:51.829> time<00:02:51.980> holding<00:02:52.219> this<00:02:52.549> in<00:02:52.760> the

the drain line I will show you how I

00:03:40.150 --> 00:03:42.610 
the drain line I will show you how I
kind<00:03:41.150> of<00:03:41.180> took<00:03:41.419> that<00:03:41.479> apart<00:03:41.810> how<00:03:41.989> I<00:03:42.019> did<00:03:42.290> dealt

00:03:42.610 --> 00:03:42.620 
kind of took that apart how I did dealt

really clean clean clean cut gaskets
like<00:03:47.989> this<00:03:48.199> too<00:03:48.409> I<00:03:48.470> let<00:03:48.739> them<00:03:48.829> make<00:03:48.949> another

00:03:49.179 --> 00:03:49.189 
like this too I let them make another

00:03:49.189 --> 00:03:52.509 
like this too I let them make another
one<00:03:49.310> for<00:03:49.489> the<00:03:49.549> other<00:03:49.669> side<00:03:49.970> so<00:03:51.400> basically<00:03:52.400> this

00:03:52.509 --> 00:03:52.519 
one for the other side so basically this

00:03:52.519 --> 00:03:54.699 
one for the other side so basically this
arrangement<00:03:52.909> will<00:03:53.180> fit<00:03:53.359> like<00:03:53.540> this<00:03:53.810> be<00:03:54.560> kind

00:03:54.699 --> 00:03:54.709 
arrangement will fit like this be kind

00:03:54.709 --> 00:03:58.209 
arrangement will fit like this be kind
of<00:03:54.829> a<00:03:54.919> deal<00:03:55.189> that<00:03:55.729> just<00:03:56.030> attaches<00:03:56.569> like<00:03:56.780> so<00:03:57.219> and

00:03:58.209 --> 00:03:58.219 
of a deal that just attaches like so and

00:03:58.219 --> 00:04:00.490 
of a deal that just attaches like so and
i'm<00:03:58.310> going<00:03:58.459> to<00:03:58.519> take<00:03:58.699> in<00:03:59.019> sweat<00:04:00.019> this<00:04:00.290> orb

00:04:00.490 --> 00:04:00.500 
i'm going to take in sweat this orb

00:04:00.500 --> 00:04:04.509 
i'm going to take in sweat this orb
raises<00:04:00.949> together<00:04:02.199> and<00:04:03.199> this<00:04:04.099> is<00:04:04.159> what
