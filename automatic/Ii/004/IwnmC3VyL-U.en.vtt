that lack of equal temperament right now

00:03:16.370 --> 00:03:19.630

romantic repertoire on it to compare

00:03:24.940 --> 00:03:27.370 
romantic repertoire on it to compare
alright<00:03:25.940> maybe<00:03:26.540> I<00:03:26.690> should<00:03:26.900> pull<00:03:27.080> it<00:03:27.110> back<00:03:27.350> a

00:03:27.370 --> 00:03:27.380 
alright maybe I should pull it back a

00:03:27.380 --> 00:03:28.560 
alright maybe I should pull it back a
little<00:03:27.680> bit

00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:28.570 
little bit

00:03:28.570 --> 00:03:34.720 
little bit
okay<00:03:29.570> the<00:03:29.720> lid<00:03:29.900> is<00:03:30.019> closed<00:03:33.430> perhaps<00:03:34.430> I<00:03:34.550> should

00:03:34.720 --> 00:03:34.730 
okay the lid is closed perhaps I should

00:03:34.730 --> 00:03:37.720 
okay the lid is closed perhaps I should
put<00:03:34.760> the<00:03:34.970> lid<00:03:35.150> up<00:03:35.300> first<00:03:36.489> even<00:03:37.489> though<00:03:37.580> that's

00:03:37.720 --> 00:03:37.730 
put the lid up first even though that's

00:03:37.730 --> 00:03:39.340 
put the lid up first even though that's
not<00:03:38.060> a<00:03:38.120> fair<00:03:38.330> comparison<00:03:38.510> because<00:03:39.050> the<00:03:39.230> other

00:03:39.340 --> 00:03:39.350 
not a fair comparison because the other

00:03:39.350 --> 00:03:41.800 
not a fair comparison because the other
pianos<00:03:39.800> are<00:03:39.950> live<00:03:40.100> closed<00:03:40.630> cheers<00:03:41.630> of

here it's out of tuna so as I say try to
look<00:04:41.750> past<00:04:42.020> that<00:04:42.290> because<00:04:42.500> it<00:04:42.710> will<00:04:42.830> be

00:04:43.350 --> 00:04:43.360 
look past that because it will be

00:04:43.360 --> 00:04:48.250 
look past that because it will be
refined<00:04:44.360> tuning<00:04:45.200> in<00:04:45.440> a<00:04:45.620> short<00:04:46.010> time<00:04:46.250> now<00:04:47.080> is<00:04:48.080> it

00:04:48.250 --> 00:04:48.260 
refined tuning in a short time now is it

00:04:48.260 --> 00:05:38.779 
refined tuning in a short time now is it
