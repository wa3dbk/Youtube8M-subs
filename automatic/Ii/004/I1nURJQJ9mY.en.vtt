 what we have today 

00:00:06.200 --> 00:00:12.200
 we start with three bottles 

00:00:08.799 --> 00:00:18.129
 disposable soda cutouts and 

00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:18.129
 here inside carrots three carrots 

00:00:20.289 --> 00:00:25.000
 what I want to show you I 'm something 

00:00:22.359 --> 00:00:27.070
 extraordinary because this universe does not 

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:30.400
 it only makes more properties but also 

00:00:27.070 --> 00:00:36.510
 exotic things 

00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:36.510
 and exquisite we are going up a meter 

00:00:36.760 --> 00:00:44.140
 and what we have here 

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:47.210
 an information carrot candle 

00:00:44.140 --> 00:00:50.149
 and you can see the little flowers 

00:00:47.210 --> 00:00:52.879
 from here the sail will form 

00:00:50.149 --> 00:00:56.559
 It is full of white divine flowers 

00:00:52.879 --> 00:00:56.559
 pink violet 

00:00:57.520 --> 00:01:03.980
 and everything arising from a little land in 

00:01:01.720 --> 00:01:09.159
 a disposable bottle of soda 

00:01:03.980 --> 00:01:09.159
 notice here we have another 

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:16.460
 is the size is not true from the base 

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:23.390
 to the flower 

00:01:20.550 --> 00:01:23.390
 we have 

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:27.130
 one meter 40 

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:34.820

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:34.820

00:01:34.830 --> 00:01:40.900

 well something more divine ever 

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:55.350
 and this grows in humble bottles 

00:01:52.270 --> 00:01:55.350
 and a little land 

00:01:57.620 --> 00:02:00.980
 and this what I wanted to show you today 

00:01:59.230 --> 00:02:05.120
 regardless of the value of the 

00:02:00.980 --> 00:02:08.420
 carrot obviously as a nutrient 

00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:10.670
 we can enjoy the aesthetics of 

00:02:08.420 --> 00:02:13.500

 with a disposable bottle of sodas 

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:19.090

00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:22.240
 petals wonders of the nature of 

00:02:19.090 --> 00:02:24.430
 universe are going to give many seeds that 

00:02:22.240 --> 00:02:26.690
 then they will give a next generation 

00:02:24.430 --> 00:02:29.600
 of carrots 

00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:33.910
 what do you think is worth it is not true 

00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:33.910
 it's worth dedicating a little
