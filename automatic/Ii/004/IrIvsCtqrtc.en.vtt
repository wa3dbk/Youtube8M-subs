front<00:01:54.110> of<00:01:54.290> me<00:01:55.210> let's<00:01:56.210> see<00:01:57.369> this'll<00:01:58.369> be<00:01:58.490> fun

00:01:58.889 --> 00:01:58.899 
front of me let's see this'll be fun

00:01:58.899 --> 00:02:02.289 
front of me let's see this'll be fun
this<00:01:59.899> is<00:02:00.170> a<00:02:00.200> the<00:02:01.189> Jordans<00:02:01.580> are<00:02:01.640> number<00:02:01.909> 280

00:02:02.289 --> 00:02:02.299 
this is a the Jordans are number 280

00:02:02.299 --> 00:02:04.480 
this is a the Jordans are number 280
when<00:02:03.200> all<00:02:03.350> the<00:02:03.470> other<00:02:03.500> base<00:02:03.860> looks<00:02:04.190> like<00:02:04.340> the

00:02:04.480 --> 00:02:04.490 
when all the other base looks like the

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:06.430 
when all the other base looks like the
number<00:02:04.759> 250<00:02:05.330> okay<00:02:05.930> it's<00:02:06.080> a<00:02:06.140> little<00:02:06.170> more

00:02:06.430 --> 00:02:06.440 
number 250 okay it's a little more

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:09.340 
number 250 okay it's a little more
Jordan<00:02:07.220> joins<00:02:07.369> if<00:02:07.640> I<00:02:07.759> would<00:02:07.970> add<00:02:08.209> more<00:02:08.989> Jordan

00:02:09.340 --> 00:02:09.350 
Jordan joins if I would add more Jordan

00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:10.990 
Jordan joins if I would add more Jordan
so<00:02:09.500> the<00:02:09.590> base<00:02:09.770> jordan's<00:02:10.160> number<00:02:10.250> 280<00:02:10.640> they'll

00:02:10.990 --> 00:02:11.000 
so the base jordan's number 280 they'll

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:12.250 
so the base jordan's number 280 they'll
probably<00:02:11.180> felt<00:02:11.420> just<00:02:11.600> as<00:02:11.720> strong<00:02:11.930> as<00:02:12.080> anybody

00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:12.260 
probably felt just as strong as anybody

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:16.589 
probably felt just as strong as anybody
else<00:02:12.560> while<00:02:12.739> though<00:02:14.019> don't<00:02:15.019> you<00:02:15.410> dare<00:02:15.620> look

00:02:16.589 --> 00:02:16.599 
else while though don't you dare look

00:02:16.599 --> 00:02:19.990
