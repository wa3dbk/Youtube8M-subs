00:00:00.290 --> 00:00:04.350
 when you who could be killing could 

00:00:02.850 --> 00:00:05.970
 You're stealing but you 're wasting your time. 

00:00:04.350 --> 00:00:06.810
 watching these like these videos that I 

00:00:05.970 --> 00:00:08.400
 I do 

00:00:06.810 --> 00:00:11.280
 They noticed that I'm going to be on the wrong side. 

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:13.410
 I'll try to show how strange it is. 

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:16.260
 drove the car on the wrong side 

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:18.060
 the first set of the steering wheel it is 

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:21.330
 on the right place 

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:24.090
 the standards are english but it's funny how 

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:27.330
 the arrow is here or is this whole set 

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:29.820
 he was moved back and forth to hit 

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:32.160
 the same side or the connection of the 

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:33.780
 of the headlight continues on the same side the key 

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:36.090
 is the connection to lose the connection 

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:38.760
 the wiper remains on the same side 

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:41.520
 the pedals remain the same 

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:43.020
 configuration or I keep stepping on 

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:44.550
 accelerator with the right leg on the 

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:46.489
 clutch with left leg 

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:48.719
 fortunately the whole was moved here 

00:00:46.489 --> 00:00:52.320
 and this car has one thing very 

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:54.270
 funny that set you see that 

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:56.039
 the handbrake is further away from me if 

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:59.370
 you search the internet for a photo of the 

00:00:56.039 --> 00:01:01.260
 307 normal you will see that the brake 

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:04.320
 hand is next to the other driver. 

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:06.479
 that is, they did not change the 

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:09.360
 they simply adapted 

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:11.700
 spend a steering wheel back and forth and then 

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:14.450
 leave the same console then it ends 

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:17.850
 making a lot of sense on this side 

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:19.860
 because what's the point of having the brake 

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:21.930
 hand away from you, see you close to you 

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:24.869
 to be easier to pull a thing 

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:27.330
 that was strange and the march is 

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:29.220
 the same set, that is, if you are 

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:31.560
 accustomed to bring the first near 

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:33.380
 You're even stranger because the 

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:36.390
 first here I have to put 

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:40.079
 away from me it 's very strange that 

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:42.810
 here i will drive a little now let's go 

00:01:40.079 --> 00:01:45.119
 Give the camera a little and I'll 

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:48.840
 try to show a little how the street is 

00:01:45.119 --> 00:01:52.159
 here and how weird this exchange of 

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:52.159
 march on the wrong side 

00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:58.630
 It's very strange that it will leave with the 

00:01:57.100 --> 00:02:01.990
 you will have that movement of 

00:01:58.630 --> 00:02:04.000
 bring the march to you it is not for there is 

00:02:01.990 --> 00:02:07.590
 It's very strange, it's here for a change. 

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:07.590
 raining, welcome to london 

00:02:08.979 --> 00:02:12.010
 and then when you go out on the street you already have 

00:02:10.869 --> 00:02:12.760
 that you take care that you have to 

00:02:12.010 --> 00:02:16.240
 position 

00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:18.040
 the other side you come in a corner is 

00:02:16.240 --> 00:02:20.020
 It's very strange because I'm going to 

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:21.489
 here we are accustomed to entering 

00:02:20.020 --> 00:02:22.750
 on the right no I have to lend 

00:02:21.489 --> 00:02:27.310
 much attention that I have to get the 

00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:29.050
 the other side and also made 

00:02:27.310 --> 00:02:31.090
 situations that I think is weird is 

00:02:29.050 --> 00:02:33.070
 It was very strange to have gone on the 

00:02:31.090 --> 00:02:35.530
 I'm returning the second is one of the 

00:02:33.070 --> 00:02:37.840
 weird situations in this place 

00:02:35.530 --> 00:02:39.730
 what a square 

00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:41.950
 may seem silly but circumvent a 

00:02:39.730 --> 00:02:43.900
 square becomes an adventure for your head 

00:02:41.950 --> 00:02:46.120
 who is accustomed to driving on the other 

00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:47.560
 side of the street because you arrive in a phrase 

00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:49.390
 that 's right now you can do it 

00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:51.700
 imagine what it feels like to get 

00:02:49.390 --> 00:02:55.660
 hug and drop to the left for example 

00:02:51.700 --> 00:02:56.920
 This place here I go here and I have 

00:02:55.660 --> 00:02:59.470
 to be careful that I do not go to the village 

00:02:56.920 --> 00:03:01.660
 from there I go to this track you have 

00:02:59.470 --> 00:03:02.799
 You have to stay glued to the left. 

00:03:01.660 --> 00:03:06.130
 very strange 

00:03:02.799 --> 00:03:08.049
 It is very strange the traffic on the street as 

00:03:06.130 --> 00:03:09.370
 you have to position the tracks as 

00:03:08.049 --> 00:03:11.200
 You have to position yourself in this 

00:03:09.370 --> 00:03:13.570
 traffic light the same thing I want to see if 

00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:16.989
 I can show you something at that traffic light. 

00:03:13.570 --> 00:03:19.000
 that is the warning light can not see the 

00:03:16.989 --> 00:03:21.610
 Traffic lights here when you 're leaving with 

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:23.410
 the car it first so yellow and 

00:03:21.610 --> 00:03:25.090
 so the yellow red together it's to 

00:03:23.410 --> 00:03:28.030
 You're still the first one you're going 

00:03:25.090 --> 00:03:30.010
 Get out there and then you can light yellow 

00:03:28.030 --> 00:03:32.290
 already engages the march that opened lighthouse 

00:03:30.010 --> 00:03:34.329
 this is very practical that would be good and are 

00:03:32.290 --> 00:03:36.459
 paulo do porto takes half an hour to leave 

00:03:34.329 --> 00:03:38.920
 this milestone gives a warning that it is time to 

00:03:36.459 --> 00:03:40.840
 sit first and leave with your car and 

00:03:38.920 --> 00:03:43.450
 You gotta let me see you're giving it to me. 

00:03:40.840 --> 00:03:46.209
 you stand on the wrong side of the 

00:03:43.450 --> 00:03:48.790
 water is very strange for your 

00:03:46.209 --> 00:03:50.859
 head off by your brain create the 

00:03:48.790 --> 00:03:53.290
 notion of distance from that side you do not 

00:03:50.859 --> 00:03:56.380
 Have I wanted Mexico in the mirror here? 

00:03:53.290 --> 00:03:57.970
 and the side mirror until you 

00:03:56.380 --> 00:04:00.340
 to get accustomed that you have to 

00:03:57.970 --> 00:04:02.230
 guide and approach the 

00:04:00.340 --> 00:04:04.780
 right is very strange 

00:04:02.230 --> 00:04:05.610
 it's very strange another detail here 

00:04:04.780 --> 00:04:07.380
 follow 

00:04:05.610 --> 00:04:08.580
 you can not pass the guy said 

00:04:07.380 --> 00:04:10.980
 it's not Sao Paulo, you do not have to 

00:04:08.580 --> 00:04:12.030
 follow the guy you can not pass 

00:04:10.980 --> 00:04:13.950
 you have to respect 

00:04:12.030 --> 00:04:18.540
 if you have a place with lots of space 

00:04:13.950 --> 00:04:20.609
 You call right away and pass if you do not. 

00:04:18.540 --> 00:04:23.040
 is not allowed to pass if you take a 

00:04:20.609 --> 00:04:26.880
 daughter of cyclist he will write down the sign 

00:04:23.040 --> 00:04:29.450
 You're fucking the one title and here's the 

00:04:26.880 --> 00:04:31.800
 fused with capital s 

00:04:29.450 --> 00:04:33.510
 well now I'll get some traffic 

00:04:31.800 --> 00:04:35.250
 He refused anything different from sao paulo 

00:04:33.510 --> 00:04:37.440
 so I do not have to show anymore 

00:04:35.250 --> 00:04:40.080
 who have liked the idea of ​​difference 

00:04:37.440 --> 00:04:42.780
 of the world as the car is set up a 

00:04:40.080 --> 00:04:46.260
 last detail that if the brake the car is 

00:04:42.780 --> 00:04:48.600
 so adapted that you hit the brake 

00:04:46.260 --> 00:04:50.610
 I hear the noise of the little donkey the noise 

00:04:48.600 --> 00:04:52.770
 from the river comes from there because the river continues 

00:04:50.610 --> 00:04:56.400
 there what they did was put a 

00:04:52.770 --> 00:04:58.500
 iron bar down here to do 

00:04:56.400 --> 00:05:00.570
 pedal connection with a donkey there is 

00:04:58.500 --> 00:05:02.550
 equal to the criterion of auto school that has 

00:05:00.570 --> 00:05:04.860
 the brake pedal the instructor they pass 

00:05:02.550 --> 00:05:07.919
 that same bar and put the car is 

00:05:04.860 --> 00:05:10.800
 clearly adapted to the English standard. 

00:05:07.919 --> 00:05:12.780
 car is manufactured from Ypejhu is manufactured 

00:05:10.800 --> 00:05:15.060
 here in the region is one of the most 

00:05:12.780 --> 00:05:18.180
 they sell here in england and the car 

00:05:15.060 --> 00:05:20.010
 adapted it is not made here 

00:05:18.180 --> 00:05:21.600
 is the price you pay for being one of the 

00:05:20.010 --> 00:05:25.770
 few places that have this hand 

00:05:21.600 --> 00:05:27.720
 contrary ii is this will look for the 

00:05:25.770 --> 00:05:31.040
 what to do to waste your time in 

00:05:27.720 --> 00:05:31.040
 Youtube on facebook is fine, thank you.
