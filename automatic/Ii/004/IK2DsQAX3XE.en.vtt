this<00:00:01.800> is<00:00:02.010> the<00:00:02.610> test<00:00:02.879> for<00:00:03.090> lipids<00:00:04.049> which<00:00:04.259> is<00:00:04.529> an

00:00:04.730 --> 00:00:04.740 
this is the test for lipids which is an

00:00:04.740 --> 00:00:07.849 
this is the test for lipids which is an
emulsion<00:00:05.160> test<00:00:06.080> lipids<00:00:07.080> don't<00:00:07.350> dissolve<00:00:07.649> in

00:00:07.849 --> 00:00:07.859 
emulsion test lipids don't dissolve in

00:00:07.859 --> 00:00:17.080 
emulsion test lipids don't dissolve in
water<00:00:07.890> but<00:00:08.700> they<00:00:09.059> do<00:00:09.120> resolve<00:00:09.599> in<00:00:11.990> in<00:00:12.990> ethanol

00:00:17.080 --> 00:00:17.090 

00:00:17.090 --> 00:00:19.820 

which<00:00:18.090> is<00:00:18.119> an<00:00:18.390> alcohol<00:00:18.840> I<00:00:19.109> don't<00:00:19.590> know<00:00:19.650> why<00:00:19.770> I

00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:19.830 
which is an alcohol I don't know why I

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:22.880 
which is an alcohol I don't know why I
said<00:00:20.130> that<00:00:20.300> this<00:00:21.300> characteristic<00:00:21.810> is<00:00:22.289> used<00:00:22.619> in

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:22.890 
said that this characteristic is used in

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:26.870 
said that this characteristic is used in
the<00:00:23.039> emulsion<00:00:23.310> test<00:00:25.189> you<00:00:26.189> don't<00:00:26.400> start<00:00:26.730> by

00:00:26.870 --> 00:00:26.880 
the emulsion test you don't start by

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:29.060 
the emulsion test you don't start by
dissolving<00:00:27.330> the<00:00:27.390> sample<00:00:27.930> in<00:00:28.109> water<00:00:28.349> but

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:29.070 
dissolving the sample in water but

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:32.240 
dissolving the sample in water but
instead<00:00:29.310> you<00:00:30.019> visit<00:00:31.019> vigorously<00:00:31.650> shake<00:00:31.949> some

00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:32.250 
instead you visit vigorously shake some

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:34.130 
instead you visit vigorously shake some
of<00:00:32.369> the<00:00:32.520> test<00:00:32.790> sample<00:00:33.329> was<00:00:33.420> about<00:00:33.600> formerly

00:00:34.130 --> 00:00:34.140 
of the test sample was about formerly

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:37.549 
of the test sample was about formerly
it's<00:00:34.290> a<00:00:34.410> ethanol<00:00:35.070> so<00:00:36.260> basically<00:00:37.260> what<00:00:37.500> you

00:00:37.549 --> 00:00:37.559 
it's a ethanol so basically what you

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:40.850 
it's a ethanol so basically what you
need<00:00:37.680> to<00:00:37.800> know<00:00:37.890> if<00:00:38.010> the<00:00:38.129> exam<00:00:38.430> is<00:00:38.780> you<00:00:39.860> ship

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:40.860 
need to know if the exam is you ship

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:49.970 
need to know if the exam is you ship
shake<00:00:41.399> it's<00:00:42.000> with<00:00:43.280> ethanol<00:00:48.440> the<00:00:49.440> test<00:00:49.680> sample

00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:49.980 
shake it's with ethanol the test sample

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:54.860 
shake it's with ethanol the test sample
wise<00:00:50.370> and<00:00:52.250> then<00:00:53.250> if<00:00:54.120> you've<00:00:54.329> done<00:00:54.539> that<00:00:54.719> you

00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:54.870 
wise and then if you've done that you

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:56.930 
wise and then if you've done that you
decant<00:00:55.289> the<00:00:55.410> liquid<00:00:55.829> into<00:00:56.010> a<00:00:56.190> second<00:00:56.699> test

00:00:56.930 --> 00:00:56.940 
decant the liquid into a second test

00:00:56.940 --> 00:01:05.710 
decant the liquid into a second test
tube<00:00:57.270> of<00:00:57.570> water<00:01:01.160> which<00:01:03.229> you<00:01:04.229> leave<00:01:04.739> any

00:01:05.710 --> 00:01:05.720 
tube of water which you leave any

00:01:05.720 --> 00:01:12.910 
tube of water which you leave any
hunters<00:01:06.720> oh<00:01:07.430> I<00:01:08.430> can't<00:01:08.700> spell<00:01:09.049> sample<00:01:10.460> behind

00:01:12.910 --> 00:01:12.920 
hunters oh I can't spell sample behind

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:18.080 
hunters oh I can't spell sample behind
so<00:01:13.920> you've<00:01:14.850> done<00:01:15.090> that<00:01:16.369> there<00:01:17.369> is<00:01:17.460> any<00:01:17.670> lipids

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:18.090 
so you've done that there is any lipids

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:19.580 
so you've done that there is any lipids
dissolved<00:01:18.570> in<00:01:18.689> the<00:01:18.810> ethanol<00:01:19.049> they<00:01:19.380> will

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:19.590 
dissolved in the ethanol they will

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:22.550 
dissolved in the ethanol they will
precipitate<00:01:19.950> in<00:01:20.340> the<00:01:20.430> water<00:01:21.259> forming<00:01:22.259> a

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:22.560 
precipitate in the water forming a

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:28.910 
precipitate in the water forming a
cloudy<00:01:23.100> white<00:01:23.720> emulsion<00:01:25.009> which<00:01:26.009> is<00:01:26.250> why<00:01:27.920> it

00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:28.920 
cloudy white emulsion which is why it

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:32.330 
cloudy white emulsion which is why it
works<00:01:29.400> now<00:01:29.909> played<00:01:30.659> Gears<00:01:30.990> of<00:01:31.200> War<00:01:31.259> I'll<00:01:32.040> end

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:32.340 
works now played Gears of War I'll end

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:34.300 
works now played Gears of War I'll end
this<00:01:32.579> just<00:01:33.000> after<00:01:33.360> playing<00:01:33.600> Gears<00:01:33.900> of<00:01:34.049> War<00:01:34.110> 3

00:01:34.300 --> 00:01:34.310 
this just after playing Gears of War 3

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:36.350 
this just after playing Gears of War 3
and<00:01:35.310> I'm<00:01:35.369> not<00:01:35.520> going<00:01:35.670> to<00:01:35.790> leave<00:01:35.970> any<00:01:36.150> spoilers

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:36.360 
and I'm not going to leave any spoilers

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:42.100 
and I'm not going to leave any spoilers
but<00:01:37.259> there's<00:01:37.560> emulsion<00:01:38.340> in<00:01:39.890> Gears<00:01:40.890> of<00:01:41.040> War<00:01:41.159> 3

00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:42.110 
but there's emulsion in Gears of War 3

00:01:42.110 --> 00:01:46.249 
but there's emulsion in Gears of War 3
so<00:01:43.250> to<00:01:44.250> help<00:01:44.430> you<00:01:44.610> remember<00:01:45.119> it<00:01:45.360> is<00:01:45.600> what<00:01:45.750> I<00:01:45.780> did

to help me or what I do to help me
remember<00:01:48.750> a<00:01:48.810> part<00:01:49.110> of<00:01:49.170> making<00:01:49.320> these<00:01:49.439> videos

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:49.770 
remember a part of making these videos

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:55.490 
remember a part of making these videos
is<00:01:51.020> associated<00:01:52.020> with<00:01:52.380> Gears<00:01:53.040> of<00:01:53.220> War<00:01:54.200> so<00:01:55.200> if

00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:55.500 
is associated with Gears of War so if

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:59.920 
is associated with Gears of War so if
you<00:01:55.680> do<00:01:55.829> that<00:01:57.770> you<00:01:58.770> should<00:01:58.950> remember<00:01:59.130> it

00:01:59.920 --> 00:01:59.930 
you do that you should remember it

00:01:59.930 --> 00:02:04.030 
you do that you should remember it
basically<00:02:00.930> and<00:02:01.649> that's<00:02:02.399> the<00:02:02.549> test<00:02:02.790> for<00:02:02.909> lipids

00:02:04.030 --> 00:02:04.040 
basically and that's the test for lipids

00:02:04.040 --> 00:02:08.059 
basically and that's the test for lipids
very<00:02:05.040> simple

00:02:08.059 --> 00:02:08.069 

00:02:08.069 --> 00:02:10.139
