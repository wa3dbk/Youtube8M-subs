00:00:09.629 --> 00:00:12.759
 the fans of strategy are in luck 

00:00:12.759 --> 00:00:15.649
 because they do not deliver those epic matches 

00:00:15.649 --> 00:00:18.060
 Swedish capital 

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:22.189
 the argument is quite simple a country in South America has been taken by a 

00:00:22.189 --> 00:00:25.519
 guerrilla if the services are sent to solve the problem 

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:29.369
 unlike their previous deliveries 

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:32.300
 in which the action developed the suggested dress 

00:00:32.300 --> 00:00:35.560
 Tactics brings a twist to the saga becoming a game of 

00:00:35.560 --> 00:00:37.020
 strategy 

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:38.749
 we will control the teams 

00:00:38.749 --> 00:00:39.940
 for February 

00:00:39.940 --> 00:00:42.450
 formed by two soldiers each 

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:45.629
 Our mission will be to place them where we think convenient 

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:50.100
 to attack the enemies outside we have sent all of us together it was 

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:52.950
 divided into groups to remove them from various positions 

00:00:52.950 --> 00:00:56.050
 in no time we can move the characters 

00:00:56.050 --> 00:01:00.200
 we will limit has signaled must come here enemies must attack and as 

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:01.550
 they must do 

00:01:01.550 --> 00:01:04.879
 we can choose between firearms and grenades with killing them and if they know 

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:09.399
 it's not an action game so this new approach can please 

00:01:09.399 --> 00:01:11.870
 all the followers of this saga 

00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:15.080
 we all have to do it and think carefully about our actions 

00:01:16.180 --> 00:01:18.860
 the game has nine single-player missions 

00:01:18.860 --> 00:01:21.700
 in each mission we will have to fulfill several objectives 

00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:24.700
 as rescued certain people hang be a specific point 

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:26.850
 before each mission 

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:29.390
 we can choose the turning point ie 

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:31.260
 where we want to start 

00:01:31.260 --> 00:01:33.520
 this makes it have a great rise 

00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:36.520
 since according to what we say we will have to fulfill different objectives 

00:01:37.300 --> 00:01:38.980
 in addition to main mode 

00:01:38.980 --> 00:01:42.560
 we have the online multiplayer where several players can join for the 

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:43.930
 exercise of its functions 

00:01:43.930 --> 00:01:45.259
 like a pitched battle 

00:01:45.259 --> 00:01:48.259
 -supress ponce action in different scenarios 

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:52.130
 the graphic section does not reach levels of execution of st 

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:53.790
 it is very careful 

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:57.170
 the scenarios are very broad yet we will not suffer at any time 

00:01:57.170 --> 00:01:59.390
 slowdown 

00:01:59.390 --> 00:02:02.539
 the music highlights too much person to reach goal situations 

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:06.310
 has a high level Spanish dubbing 

00:02:06.310 --> 00:02:08.909
 during the game we will go the boots of the soldiers 

00:02:08.909 --> 00:02:12.569
 the orders that do well through radio and those of other characters such as 

00:02:12.569 --> 00:02:14.249
 enemies 

00:02:14.249 --> 00:02:17.590
 This hospital is a title to keep in mind if you like games of 

00:02:17.589 --> 00:02:18.659
 strategy 

00:02:18.659 --> 00:02:22.639
 your numerous missions and online modalities will be that you enjoy during a 

00:02:22.639 --> 00:02:23.349
 good number of hours
