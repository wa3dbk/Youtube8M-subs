00:02:20.490 --> 00:02:32.110 

oh<00:02:26.150> no<00:02:27.740> bonus<00:02:28.740> five

00:02:32.110 --> 00:02:32.120 

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:34.400 

maybe<00:02:33.120> we<00:02:33.210> should<00:02:33.360> do<00:02:33.420> another<00:02:33.450> set<00:02:33.870> I<00:02:34.200> think

maybe we should do another set I think

00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:35.720 
maybe we should do another set I think
one<00:02:34.710> more<00:02:34.740> think<00:02:35.370> so<00:02:35.490> too

00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:35.730 
one more think so too

00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:42.230 
one more think so too
oh<00:02:38.930> that<00:02:39.930> seemed<00:02:40.380> terrible<00:02:40.920> I<00:02:41.190> guess<00:02:42.060> it<00:02:42.210> looks

00:02:42.230 --> 00:02:42.240 
oh that seemed terrible I guess it looks

00:02:42.240 --> 00:02:43.790 
oh that seemed terrible I guess it looks
possible<00:02:42.870> that<00:02:42.960> I<00:02:42.990> have<00:02:43.050> a<00:02:43.170> little<00:02:43.320> more<00:02:43.500> curve

00:02:43.790 --> 00:02:43.800
