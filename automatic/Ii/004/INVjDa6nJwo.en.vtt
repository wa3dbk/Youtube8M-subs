00:00:01.060 --> 00:00:03.329
 yes 

00:00:14.830 --> 00:00:20.140
 Hi, girls, I do not know if it happened to you 

00:00:17.680 --> 00:00:22.150
 but it has happened to me that I had many 

00:00:20.140 --> 00:00:23.860
 problems with the heels and in the end I've 

00:00:22.150 --> 00:00:25.540
 had to look everywhere before 

00:00:23.860 --> 00:00:28.119
 a solution and in the end he has found it 

00:00:25.540 --> 00:00:29.619
 so I'm going to give you the tips that 

00:00:28.119 --> 00:00:32.680
 he has learned about my entire career 

00:00:29.619 --> 00:00:35.400
 with the heels and I hope some of 

00:00:32.680 --> 00:00:38.800
 these then serve you to start 

00:00:35.400 --> 00:00:40.180
 when some shoes do not squeeze I think 

00:00:38.800 --> 00:00:41.949
 I've already said in some video 

00:00:40.180 --> 00:00:44.110
 previously that the best we can 

00:00:41.949 --> 00:00:46.300
 do is put them in the freezer because 

00:00:44.110 --> 00:00:49.059
 put them in the freezer as is in a 

00:00:46.300 --> 00:00:51.790
 plastic bag because this will make 

00:00:49.059 --> 00:00:54.729
 the fibers when you take them out of the 

00:00:51.790 --> 00:00:57.220
 freezer best suit your foot is 

00:00:54.729 --> 00:01:00.489
 as if we wanted to shrink it for 

00:00:57.220 --> 00:01:02.920
 then adapt it then we would leave in 

00:01:00.489 --> 00:01:04.869
 the freezer the shoe all night and 

00:01:02.920 --> 00:01:08.950
 the next morning we would put a 

00:01:04.869 --> 00:01:10.390
 little bit in the sun to leave 2s 

00:01:08.950 --> 00:01:12.200
 all that water that has been accumulated 

00:01:10.390 --> 00:01:14.600
 inside 

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:17.360
 and then we would not put it and already 

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:19.729
 you will see how it fits really well the 

00:01:17.360 --> 00:01:22.310
 tongue thing to avoid friction what 

00:01:19.729 --> 00:01:24.530
 What we can do is take a little bit of 

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:26.810
 moisturizer and throw it away so it's 

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:28.939
 here for the inside of the shoe 

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:31.579
 then we would apply here and for the 

00:01:28.939 --> 00:01:34.069
 lateral then this that would make 

00:01:31.579 --> 00:01:36.020
 when we put the shoe on 

00:01:34.069 --> 00:01:39.049
 be the friction that makes us here the 

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:41.060
 damage and many times we get the area 

00:01:39.049 --> 00:01:43.579
 that makes friction look like 

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:46.369
 red and it hurts a lot then that 

00:01:43.579 --> 00:01:48.950
 then we would avoid it also when 

00:01:46.369 --> 00:01:51.530
 we have a shoe that slips a 

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:54.259
 mogollÃ³n and we do not want to kill us out there 

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:58.610
 then what we can do is catch 

00:01:54.259 --> 00:02:00.770
 Scissors and pick up the tip and scratch 

00:01:58.610 --> 00:02:04.069
 the by the surface then we would be 

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:07.039
 so plates a lot of lines there 

00:02:04.069 --> 00:02:11.780
 without mercy and then this will make 

00:02:07.039 --> 00:02:14.450
 when the shoe is walking on a 

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:16.459
 very clever surface will grip better to 

00:02:14.450 --> 00:02:18.380
 that surface and we will not reserve that 

00:02:16.459 --> 00:02:20.660
 Yet even happened to us a lot just 

00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:22.490
 with all the white shoes I get 

00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:25.220
 even with the plans with some boots 

00:02:22.490 --> 00:02:27.470
 was about to kill me for that reason 

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:30.640
 because it had too much surface 

00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:33.400
 smooth and had no grip 

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:35.620
 then this is one of the things then 

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:37.900
 if they have if the foot backs us 

00:02:35.620 --> 00:02:39.910
 We can apply a little bit of 

00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:42.010
 lacquer over here inside the shoe 

00:02:39.910 --> 00:02:44.590
 at a distance then something like that and then 

00:02:42.010 --> 00:02:46.720
 we would apply a little bit of the 

00:02:44.590 --> 00:02:48.610
 cala we will leave a little dry and not what 

00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:51.560
 we would put then that will make the foot 

00:02:48.610 --> 00:02:55.099
 take us much better 

00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:57.770
 and then on the other hand if we have the foot 

00:02:55.099 --> 00:02:59.569
 that helps us a lot, I met a 

00:02:57.770 --> 00:03:03.890
 person who did it and it worked 

00:02:59.569 --> 00:03:05.780
 great that he used talcum powder 

00:03:03.890 --> 00:03:09.709
 I used it inside the shoe 

00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:11.780
 then this made all that whole 

00:03:09.709 --> 00:03:13.370
 moisture generated by the foot is like 

00:03:11.780 --> 00:03:17.750
 I sucked the talcum powder then 

00:03:13.370 --> 00:03:20.150
 made her shoe better 

00:03:17.750 --> 00:03:23.300
 heel so I do not expect you to have 

00:03:20.150 --> 00:03:25.069
 served these tricks that you leave me 

00:03:23.300 --> 00:03:26.690
 down here all those that you 

00:03:25.069 --> 00:03:29.120
 They have worked for me also 

00:03:26.690 --> 00:03:32.500
 can try and serve me some insurance and 

00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:32.500
 that we see in the next video
