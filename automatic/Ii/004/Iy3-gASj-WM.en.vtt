 What they liked was September 05 

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:17.940
 of 2012 I was a big fan of the sagas of 

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:20.400
 grand theft auto iv was excited 

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:22.470
 that leave the tag 5 Then I was 

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:24.750
 saving to buy me because I knew 

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:26.849
 it was going to cost a lot one day I found 

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:29.220
 the game I thought was a lie but it was 

00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:31.410
 addicted 5 I said to the gentleman of the store 

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:33.420
 how much it cost and the man told me how 

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:36.120
 he was very very collector told me that it cost 

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:38.460
 50 pesos I went to my house quickly broke 

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:40.170
 my piggy bank and I got the 50 pesos but 

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:42.390
 when the seller arrives he was 

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:44.070
 scared and he gave me the free game I do not know 

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:45.930
 why but he told me he will not take me 

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:47.820

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:49.770
 I wanted to stay, I told him that if 

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:51.600

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:54.360

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:58.350
 very scared but also encouraged that 

00:00:56.489 --> 00:01:00.449
 I was going to be the first person 

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:02.550

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:04.650

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:08.579
