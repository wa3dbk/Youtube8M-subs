now<00:00:02.419> with<00:00:03.419> the<00:00:03.629> Honda<00:00:04.020> engine<00:00:04.440> ona<00:00:04.700> gvc<00:00:05.750> 160

00:00:06.740 --> 00:00:06.750 
now with the Honda engine ona gvc 160

00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:09.919 
now with the Honda engine ona gvc 160
engine<00:00:07.379> five<00:00:07.620> and<00:00:07.830> a<00:00:07.859> half<00:00:07.890> horsepower<00:00:08.929> this

00:00:09.919 --> 00:00:09.929 
engine five and a half horsepower this

00:00:09.929 --> 00:00:12.890 
engine five and a half horsepower this
one<00:00:10.139> actually<00:00:10.320> came<00:00:10.679> out<00:00:11.389> nicer<00:00:12.389> than<00:00:12.630> the

00:00:12.890 --> 00:00:12.900 
one actually came out nicer than the

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:15.350 
one actually came out nicer than the
other<00:00:13.049> one<00:00:13.259> I<00:00:13.290> had<00:00:13.650> I<00:00:13.980> think<00:00:14.880> it<00:00:14.969> runs<00:00:15.089> much

00:00:15.350 --> 00:00:15.360 
other one I had I think it runs much

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:20.900 
other one I had I think it runs much
better<00:00:15.599> too<00:00:15.900> so<00:00:18.980> change<00:00:19.980> the<00:00:20.130> oil<00:00:20.160> in<00:00:20.400> this<00:00:20.609> and

00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:20.910 
better too so change the oil in this and

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:22.730 
better too so change the oil in this and
sharpen<00:00:21.689> the<00:00:21.750> blade<00:00:21.960> and<00:00:22.260> clean<00:00:22.470> the<00:00:22.619> air

00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:22.740 
sharpen the blade and clean the air

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:28.130 
sharpen the blade and clean the air
filter<00:00:25.099> and<00:00:26.099> those<00:00:26.279> rear<00:00:26.550> levers<00:00:27.539> to<00:00:27.750> raise

00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:28.140 
filter and those rear levers to raise

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:29.720 
filter and those rear levers to raise
the<00:00:28.320> wheels<00:00:28.529> up<00:00:28.800> and<00:00:28.980> down<00:00:29.130> and<00:00:29.369> we're<00:00:29.490> frozen

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:29.730 
the wheels up and down and we're frozen

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:36.229 
the wheels up and down and we're frozen
that<00:00:30.060> got<00:00:30.240> those<00:00:31.969> unfrozen<00:00:32.969> now<00:00:33.300> I<00:00:35.030> can<00:00:36.030> raise

00:00:36.229 --> 00:00:36.239 
that got those unfrozen now I can raise

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:49.890 
that got those unfrozen now I can raise
the<00:00:37.190> all<00:00:38.190> the<00:00:38.430> way<00:00:38.520> up<00:00:38.640> to<00:00:38.820> the<00:00:38.940> top<00:00:39.149> now

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:49.900 

00:00:49.900 --> 00:00:54.840 

and<00:00:50.900> looks<00:00:51.140> really<00:00:51.320> good<00:00:52.010> underneath<00:00:52.340> as<00:00:52.640> well

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:54.850 

00:00:54.850 --> 00:00:59.890 

well<00:00:55.850> nice<00:00:56.030> lawnmower<00:00:58.600> let's<00:00:59.600> give<00:00:59.750> it<00:00:59.780> one

00:00:59.890 --> 00:00:59.900 
well nice lawnmower let's give it one

00:00:59.900 --> 00:01:02.680 
well nice lawnmower let's give it one
final<00:01:00.050> start<00:01:00.740> here<00:01:00.980> this<00:01:01.130> one<00:01:01.340> starts<00:01:01.760> much

00:01:02.680 --> 00:01:02.690 
final start here this one starts much

00:01:02.690 --> 00:01:07.240 
final start here this one starts much
better<00:01:02.960> as<00:01:03.230> well<00:01:04.390> with<00:01:05.390> this<00:01:05.510> choke<00:01:06.250> choke

00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:07.250 
better as well with this choke choke

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:09.190 
better as well with this choke choke
doesn't<00:01:07.670> start<00:01:08.180> moving<00:01:08.510> once<00:01:08.690> you<00:01:08.840> push<00:01:09.020> the

00:01:09.190 --> 00:01:09.200 
doesn't start moving once you push the

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:12.700 
doesn't start moving once you push the
handle<00:01:09.530> down<00:01:11.050> I'm<00:01:12.050> not<00:01:12.170> sure<00:01:12.320> what<00:01:12.440> was<00:01:12.620> wrong

00:01:12.700 --> 00:01:12.710 
handle down I'm not sure what was wrong

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:15.100 
handle down I'm not sure what was wrong
with<00:01:12.920> the<00:01:12.979> other<00:01:13.100> one<00:01:13.310> I<00:01:13.840> don't<00:01:14.840> believe<00:01:15.080> that

00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:15.110 
with the other one I don't believe that

00:01:15.110 --> 00:01:16.780 
with the other one I don't believe that
was<00:01:15.440> correct<00:01:15.800> this<00:01:16.010> one<00:01:16.190> certainly<00:01:16.430> works

00:01:16.780 --> 00:01:16.790 
was correct this one certainly works

00:01:16.790 --> 00:01:20.730 
was correct this one certainly works
correctly<00:01:17.150> here<00:01:18.850> give<00:01:19.850> it<00:01:19.940> a<00:01:20.000> start

00:01:20.730 --> 00:01:20.740 
correctly here give it a start

00:01:20.740 --> 00:01:23.590 
correctly here give it a start
and<00:01:21.740> again<00:01:21.979> it's<00:01:22.160> choked<00:01:22.460> and<00:01:22.729> the<00:01:23.180> handle<00:01:23.540> is

00:01:23.590 --> 00:01:23.600 
and again it's choked and the handle is

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:25.440 
and again it's choked and the handle is
tied<00:01:23.810> down<00:01:24.080> and<00:01:24.470> the<00:01:24.530> choke<00:01:24.770> is<00:01:24.890> not<00:01:25.040> moving

00:01:25.440 --> 00:01:25.450 
tied down and the choke is not moving

00:01:25.450 --> 00:01:29.830 
tied down and the choke is not moving
let's<00:01:26.450> see<00:01:26.570> how<00:01:26.690> easy<00:01:26.930> this<00:01:27.170> will<00:01:27.290> be<00:01:27.410> to<00:01:27.530> start
