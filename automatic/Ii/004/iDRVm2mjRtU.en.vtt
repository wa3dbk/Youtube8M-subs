00:00:14.780 --> 00:00:21.350
 hello everyone with you gentoo steve today 

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:25.830
 us on the king external hard drive 

00:00:21.350 --> 00:00:26.849
 silicon power armor a80 volume 1 

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:30.869
 terabyte 

00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:32.940
 with usb 3 interfaces in short 

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:34.860
 why I chose this particular disc 

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:39.360
 because I liked it firstly 

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:41.970
 speed, that is, it is not the lowest 

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:43.430
 she is one of that is it is drive one of 

00:00:41.970 --> 00:00:47.160
 the fastest 

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:50.310
 with the interests of the petri net and the size of two with 

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:51.030
 half an inch second why i chose 

00:00:50.310 --> 00:00:54.330
 it is his 

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:58.500
 it is so protected 

00:00:54.330 --> 00:01:03.810
 that is, from external influences 

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:05.600
 anti press some kind of so and not even 

00:01:03.810 --> 00:01:09.390
 mean by 

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:12.150
 here he is not going to let it go 

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:13.470
 Generally he is waterproof 

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:16.950
 and dustproof 

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:20.909
 impact resistant generally protected by 

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:24.390
 the maximum is that he has usb plug 

00:01:20.909 --> 00:01:28.039
 this is no less a lesbian is not micro more accurate 

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:33.350
 usually avoided as a type and that is 

00:01:28.039 --> 00:01:35.520
 the usual big beat so walk along 

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:39.479
 the box itself 

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:41.939
 we have no sides here 

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:43.170
 we have written that this is ashby 3 

00:01:41.939 --> 00:01:46.490
 high speed 

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:49.469
 what standard you have military protection 

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:54.810
 pressure resistant and portable 

00:01:49.469 --> 00:02:04.619
 cable yusb so well let's unpack as 

00:01:54.810 --> 00:02:08.090
 knife neatly good sign i 

00:02:04.619 --> 00:02:08.090
 so the biggest did not open 

00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:24.650
 the effects are all in the stomach tell you to them 

00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:24.650
 away so let's open it 

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:35.790
 away we say all sorts of open 

00:02:29.490 --> 00:02:41.430
 we get what we see here so well 

00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:49.470
 first box of waste paper all to this 

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:53.160
 manuals user guides how to connect what 

00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:57.560
 they happen and have to do i think that to me 

00:02:53.160 --> 00:03:04.940
 need so most important cool 

00:02:57.560 --> 00:03:13.080
 smooth purchase that we see it everywhere 

00:03:04.940 --> 00:03:25.970
 cable length 80 4 centimeters here 

00:03:13.080 --> 00:03:30.560
 answer it from this cut and we see here 

00:03:25.970 --> 00:03:35.400
 from two sides and visby 3 

00:03:30.560 --> 00:03:39.660
 the wire is the most important thing actually 

00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:44.370
 drive itself but not light the same right away 

00:03:39.660 --> 00:03:47.880
 say on the first hand I would 

00:03:44.370 --> 00:03:54.620
 I did not say that he is more fat if 

00:03:47.880 --> 00:03:57.750
 figures how to measure it is inferior 

00:03:54.620 --> 00:04:03.000
 compactness but thanks so i think 

00:03:57.750 --> 00:04:07.080
 it doesnâ€™t seem so smooth 

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:10.170
 so huge inside you can hide 

00:04:07.080 --> 00:04:11.740
 another visby connector small such 

00:04:10.170 --> 00:04:13.960
 at all 

00:04:11.740 --> 00:04:18.489
 hold less to connect directly 

00:04:13.960 --> 00:04:19.300
 everything inside does not have nothing else here so 

00:04:18.489 --> 00:04:23.770
 we have 

00:04:19.300 --> 00:04:27.330
 izba port normal standard port in 

00:04:23.770 --> 00:04:30.910
 which we can stick our hut 

00:04:27.330 --> 00:04:34.000
 so calmly stick it in the chest 

00:04:30.910 --> 00:04:34.570
 the computer so us written here 

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:39.340
 matt 

00:04:34.570 --> 00:04:44.850
 to Taiwan 1 terabyte all sorts of tests 

00:04:39.340 --> 00:04:48.390
 silicon silicon power touch the full 

00:04:44.850 --> 00:04:52.560
 waterproof mascara is understandable even by 

00:04:48.390 --> 00:04:52.560
 this is a rubber plug 

00:04:53.160 --> 00:05:00.670
 so he blows rugged waterproof 

00:04:56.040 --> 00:05:03.430
 yeah not flammable practically i think 

00:05:00.670 --> 00:05:04.930
 possibly and the family have the courage I 

00:05:03.430 --> 00:05:10.530
 I'll do some tests 

00:05:04.930 --> 00:05:14.740
 Naturally, the video itself will show you everything 

00:05:10.530 --> 00:05:18.400
 the next video I will probably show the tests 

00:05:14.740 --> 00:05:21.430
 that is, the speed of its work record 

00:05:18.400 --> 00:05:24.190
 different files again video in 

00:05:21.430 --> 00:05:26.440
 streaming mode for what is it actually 

00:05:24.190 --> 00:05:29.770
 I needed that is one of the reasons 

00:05:26.440 --> 00:05:32.610
 This is for this video and on this for me so far 

00:05:29.770 --> 00:05:35.290
 with you all with you was gimpla stevie 

00:05:32.610 --> 00:05:38.350
 subscribe put huskies go to 

00:05:35.290 --> 00:05:40.560
 the retuses also subscribe to everyone 

00:05:38.350 --> 00:05:40.560
