00:00:07.760 --> 00:00:13.790
 before they offer very strong Tuesdays 

00:00:15.970 --> 00:00:20.650
 the conditions are not very difficult anymore 

00:00:18.730 --> 00:00:21.850
 that this morning because Maria was 

00:00:20.650 --> 00:00:23.650
 a little higher 

00:00:21.850 --> 00:00:26.350
 then the peak was a little more 

00:00:23.650 --> 00:00:28.930
 open and you had to wait for the good 

00:00:26.350 --> 00:00:31.029
 series to connect and make a pair 

00:00:28.930 --> 00:00:33.310
 of maneuvers and the truth that at 

00:00:31.029 --> 00:00:35.590
 initially I chose a little waves 

00:00:33.310 --> 00:00:39.160
 but from the next 10 

00:00:35.590 --> 00:00:41.170
 minutes of the manga already and in the game and 

00:00:39.160 --> 00:00:44.440
 I was improving my explanation that if 

00:00:41.170 --> 00:00:46.539
 you have possibilities for the world 

00:00:44.440 --> 00:00:49.989
 right now the truth is that I do not look at the 

00:00:46.539 --> 00:00:52.329
 rankings I do not know either how much I go and 

00:00:49.989 --> 00:00:53.800
 I do not care I go calm and if 

00:00:52.329 --> 00:00:55.210
 with him 

00:00:53.800 --> 00:00:57.760
 a first place in this championship 

00:00:55.210 --> 00:00:59.469
 maybe I classified myself tell us a 

00:00:57.760 --> 00:01:00.489
 little how were your beginnings why 

00:00:59.469 --> 00:01:03.059
 You did the surf 

00:01:00.489 --> 00:01:06.310
 in another good sport the truth that 

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:07.810
 I have always practiced a lot of sport and from 

00:01:06.310 --> 00:01:11.380
 small we were still on the beach 

00:01:07.810 --> 00:01:13.360
 the summers and with a very good and 

00:01:11.380 --> 00:01:16.780
 we would stand up then my mother 

00:01:13.360 --> 00:01:19.210
 saw some 56 plastic boards for 

00:01:16.780 --> 00:01:21.550
 started and he liked us took us to a 

00:01:19.210 --> 00:01:24.850
 weekend course and then those 

00:01:21.550 --> 00:01:27.039
 same kings because they gave it to us and 

00:01:24.850 --> 00:01:29.350
 since then they started to register me 

00:01:27.039 --> 00:01:31.899
 surf schools was 11 years old and 

00:01:29.350 --> 00:01:34.179
 little by little, I went getting more 

00:01:31.899 --> 00:01:36.940
 full and what differences you find between 

00:01:34.179 --> 00:01:38.170
 the waters of Lanzarote with the waters 

00:01:36.940 --> 00:01:39.000
 example of asturias with the wave of 

00:01:38.170 --> 00:01:43.150
 Asturias 

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:45.640
 the waves here there are many waves of rocks 

00:01:43.150 --> 00:01:48.210
 of rubble and that's fine because 

00:01:45.640 --> 00:01:51.640
 always speaks in the same place and is 

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:55.500
 It has more strength and everything there 

00:01:51.640 --> 00:01:55.500
 we have more mudflats 

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:07.320
 and it's a joy to surf in a bikini 

00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:25.390
 because also that I like a lot came 

00:02:22.060 --> 00:02:27.610
 already a year and something and I go every day to 

00:02:25.390 --> 00:02:30.700
 train and is a good complement with the 

00:02:27.610 --> 00:02:32.850
 surfing and good to be with my friends with my 

00:02:30.700 --> 00:02:32.850
 family 

00:02:33.239 --> 00:02:37.120
 I'm also studying 

00:02:35.620 --> 00:02:40.630
 Business Management 

00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:43.720
 I finished three years ago is going to be the 

00:02:40.630 --> 00:02:45.550
 third year in the race although I do not 

00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:48.940
 all the subjects but the truth that 

00:02:45.550 --> 00:02:51.610
 I take enough is every year to go little to 

00:02:48.940 --> 00:02:55.360
 little and also combined it with some 

00:02:51.610 --> 00:02:58.830
 with languages and I believe that in the future 

00:02:55.360 --> 00:02:58.830
 you are going to need everything
