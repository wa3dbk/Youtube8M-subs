00:00:13.220 --> 00:00:18.380
 friends friends today I'm going to make a 

00:00:15.980 --> 00:00:21.320
 cake of two colors I already wanted 

00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:23.270
 to present you this recipe that is 

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:25.640
 very simple and I'm sure you're going 

00:00:23.270 --> 00:00:27.770
 to do a lot at home look I have a 

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:29.270
 28 centimeters round mold that has already 

00:00:27.770 --> 00:00:32.240
 lifted with butter and now they 

00:00:29.270 --> 00:00:33.500
 I will prepare for flour over themselves 

00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:36.920
 so that my cake does not stick 

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:39.650
 then I have to make the dough 6 

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:42.980
 Eggs in approximately 100 milliliters 

00:00:39.650 --> 00:00:44.690
 of oil I have 200 grams of flour 

00:00:42.980 --> 00:00:47.450
 who has added a packet of yeast 

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:50.780
 in powder which are about 15 

00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:52.790
 grams 15 grams 

00:00:50.780 --> 00:00:55.090
 In America, you can replace it with 

00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:57.649
 famous baking powder 

00:00:55.090 --> 00:01:00.470
 250 grams of sugar and cocoa powder 

00:00:57.649 --> 00:01:01.910
 pure of what I'm going to put 2 tablespoons 

00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:04.220
 tureens 

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:06.650
 it came now but then I'm going to measure it 

00:01:04.220 --> 00:01:09.290
 just with the color that I like or 

00:01:06.650 --> 00:01:11.120
 because there we say we can play if 

00:01:09.290 --> 00:01:14.180
 we like the bitterest chocolate less 

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:15.770
 bitter darker less dark or there 

00:01:14.180 --> 00:01:17.810
 we are going to have the freedom to give it 

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:20.119
 us the color we want and for 

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:23.030
 we play with the amount of add 

00:01:20.119 --> 00:01:25.190
 now I'm going to beat the ingredients already 

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:28.190
 I have in the proposed to preheat 

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:29.509
 180 degrees in the fire up and down and 

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:32.390
 as soon as they have the ingredients 

00:01:29.509 --> 00:01:34.990
 shakes we put in the mold and what 

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:34.990
 we put to bake 

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:41.370
 I will explain how 

00:01:38.730 --> 00:01:43.650
 how do I put the ingredients in order 

00:01:41.370 --> 00:01:46.290
 because it's important let's put 

00:01:43.650 --> 00:01:49.890
 first the eggs then we put the 

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:54.420
 sugar then the oil and then 

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:56.120
 the flour with the yeast once 

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:58.910
 let's have 

00:01:56.120 --> 00:02:01.850
 the dough made we will add half of the 

00:01:58.910 --> 00:02:04.340
 mold and we add the cocoa to which 

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:07.880
 subtract and from there we distribute 

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:11.290
 by the mold and you see that ride 

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:11.290
 directing come on then 

00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:27.570
 you know if you have noticed 

00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:29.790
 I have beaten when I put the flour 

00:02:27.570 --> 00:02:31.319
 assets with a manual because the truth 

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:33.719
 that with him 

00:02:31.319 --> 00:02:36.409
 take with the whisk rose by others 

00:02:33.719 --> 00:02:39.190
 good blogs now as I said 

00:02:36.409 --> 00:02:42.550
 I add a part 

00:02:39.190 --> 00:02:44.320
 such mass which 

00:02:42.550 --> 00:02:46.360
 and now what's left here because I 

00:02:44.320 --> 00:02:50.470
 add a little cocoa before throwing it 

00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:52.660
 the rest of this we are going to do this 

00:02:50.470 --> 00:02:55.270
 because it costs very little what it said 

00:02:52.660 --> 00:02:56.590
 the amount is indicative and depends if 

00:02:55.270 --> 00:02:58.100
 we want more nor our two 

00:02:56.590 --> 00:03:02.020
 spoonfuls 

00:02:58.100 --> 00:03:05.680
 they are for dessert a little big 

00:03:02.020 --> 00:03:07.840
 and I will also split it in my hand 

00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:10.000
 not because they feel like working 

00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:12.159
 but because things that have dust 

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:16.510
 at least at the beginning they are 

00:03:12.159 --> 00:03:19.030
 better with fun manual because both 

00:03:16.510 --> 00:03:23.740
 spoonfuls of chocolate are more than 

00:03:19.030 --> 00:03:26.500
 enough of added 

00:03:23.740 --> 00:03:29.590
 are more than enough to have a 

00:03:26.500 --> 00:03:31.400
 pretty pretty chocolate 

00:03:29.590 --> 00:03:32.720
 colour 

00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:35.470
 i 

00:03:32.720 --> 00:03:35.470
 good 

00:03:35.560 --> 00:03:43.030
 and now I'm doing a little bit of 

00:03:41.140 --> 00:03:47.280
 drawings 

00:03:43.030 --> 00:03:49.810
 and this is that it is a thing of another world 

00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:51.670
 could have done a little less and 

00:03:49.810 --> 00:03:55.280
 I would have added more than the normal sponge cake 

00:03:51.670 --> 00:03:59.740
 because now I'm going to have too much 

00:03:55.280 --> 00:04:02.580
 chocolate mass to add but good 

00:03:59.740 --> 00:04:02.580
 everything is 

00:04:02.710 --> 00:04:05.610
 let's put it like this 

00:04:11.600 --> 00:04:17.859
 we'll talk later how is it left that 

00:04:15.170 --> 00:04:21.120
 here I have done two much 

00:04:17.859 --> 00:04:21.120
 a lot of cocoa 

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:26.160
 that the court is going to tell us 

00:04:27.760 --> 00:04:32.849
 the truth that has whiff of cocoa 

00:04:30.280 --> 00:04:36.800
 satisfaced 

00:04:32.849 --> 00:04:39.199
 and then to be very rich in that for sure 

00:04:36.800 --> 00:04:41.030
 Well now this turns color 

00:04:39.199 --> 00:04:42.470
 hot 

00:04:41.030 --> 00:04:44.090
 baked 

00:04:42.470 --> 00:04:46.310
 and 

00:04:44.090 --> 00:04:47.950
 and adding this result when you 

00:04:46.310 --> 00:04:49.960
 I teach 

00:04:47.950 --> 00:04:53.860
 good friends if this is the presentation 

00:04:49.960 --> 00:04:55.990
 end of the cake of two colors good 

00:04:53.860 --> 00:04:58.930
 I already told you that I thought I was 

00:04:55.990 --> 00:05:00.250
 pouring too much dough with flavor to 

00:04:58.930 --> 00:05:01.930
 chocolate but I like them so much 

00:05:00.250 --> 00:05:03.550
 I can not resist 

00:05:01.930 --> 00:05:06.100
 in any case it is clearly seen and the 

00:05:03.550 --> 00:05:07.990
 two if we had made even more mass 

00:05:06.100 --> 00:05:10.180
 normal and less chocolate is not 

00:05:07.990 --> 00:05:12.970
 would have simply been more area 

00:05:10.180 --> 00:05:14.830
 clear and you're done 

00:05:12.970 --> 00:05:18.850
 I hope you like it and enjoy it is 

00:05:14.830 --> 00:05:21.610
 super fluffy and is for the taste 

00:05:18.850 --> 00:05:24.100
 perfect word is not correct because 

00:05:21.610 --> 00:05:27.070
 you should never give a thing for perfect 

00:05:24.100 --> 00:05:30.270
 but it borders perfectly 

00:05:27.070 --> 00:05:30.270
 always friends
