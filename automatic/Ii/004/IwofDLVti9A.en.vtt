use my handy dandy mac fix+

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:10.070 
use my handy dandy mac fix+
to<00:01:07.320> just<00:01:07.560> dampen<00:01:08.010> it<00:01:08.130> and<00:01:08.570> go<00:01:09.570> ahead<00:01:09.720> and<00:01:09.960> blend

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:10.080 
to just dampen it and go ahead and blend

that<00:01:10.260> foundation<00:01:10.830> in<00:01:11.040> that<00:01:11.610> worked<00:01:11.880> really

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:12.210 
that foundation in that worked really

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:14.750 
that foundation in that worked really
well<00:01:12.360> I<00:01:12.780> also<00:01:13.320> used<00:01:13.799> my<00:01:13.950> fingers

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:14.760 
well I also used my fingers

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:17.770 
well I also used my fingers
that<00:01:15.119> worked<00:01:15.479> but<00:01:15.840> I<00:01:15.869> found<00:01:16.229> that<00:01:16.560> it<00:01:16.799> was<00:01:17.070> a

00:01:17.770 --> 00:01:17.780 
that worked but I found that it was a

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:21.380 
that worked but I found that it was a
bit<00:01:18.780> harder<00:01:19.229> it<00:01:19.350> did<00:01:19.500> not<00:01:19.619> go<00:01:19.860> on<00:01:19.890> as<00:01:20.460> nice<00:01:21.119> and

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:21.390 
bit harder it did not go on as nice and

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:23.570 
bit harder it did not go on as nice and
clean<00:01:21.869> and<00:01:22.049> crisp<00:01:22.259> as<00:01:22.470> it<00:01:22.740> did<00:01:22.950> with<00:01:23.250> this

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:23.580 
clean and crisp as it did with this

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:25.880 
clean and crisp as it did with this
launch<00:01:23.850> so<00:01:24.240> application<00:01:25.200> for<00:01:25.380> this<00:01:25.500> I<00:01:25.710> would

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:25.890 
launch so application for this I would

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:28.580 
launch so application for this I would
definitely<00:01:26.430> recommend<00:01:26.580> using<00:01:27.450> a<00:01:27.720> sponge<00:01:27.990> have

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:28.590 
definitely recommend using a sponge have

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:31.760 
definitely recommend using a sponge have
not<00:01:28.829> used<00:01:29.070> a<00:01:29.280> brush<00:01:29.759> I<00:01:30.479> don't<00:01:31.320> think<00:01:31.560> that<00:01:31.740> a

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:31.770 
not used a brush I don't think that a

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:33.950 
not used a brush I don't think that a
brush<00:01:32.070> would<00:01:32.250> really<00:01:32.460> work<00:01:33.030> well<00:01:33.479> with<00:01:33.780> this

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:33.960 
brush would really work well with this

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:38.050 
brush would really work well with this
because<00:01:34.229> it<00:01:34.590> is<00:01:35.509> it's<00:01:36.509> not<00:01:36.720> a<00:01:36.780> very<00:01:36.990> movable

00:01:38.050 --> 00:01:38.060 
because it is it's not a very movable

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:41.359 
because it is it's not a very movable
foundation<00:01:39.060> but<00:01:39.450> I<00:01:39.509> really<00:01:39.900> like<00:01:40.110> it<00:01:40.350> and<00:01:40.650> got

00:01:41.359 --> 00:01:41.369 
foundation but I really like it and got

00:01:41.369 --> 00:01:43.490 
foundation but I really like it and got
a<00:01:41.400> lot<00:01:41.579> of<00:01:41.610> questions<00:01:42.090> as<00:01:42.329> to<00:01:42.360> infant<00:01:43.110> hell<00:01:43.350> it
