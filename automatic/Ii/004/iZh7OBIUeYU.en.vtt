far as ingredients go the reason it's

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:14.720 
far as ingredients go the reason it's
non<00:00:13.259> baked<00:00:13.559> cheesecake<00:00:13.860> and<00:00:14.190> it<00:00:14.280> never<00:00:14.429> sees

an<00:00:14.910> oven<00:00:15.179> is<00:00:15.509> because<00:00:15.870> of<00:00:15.900> gelatin<00:00:16.470> now<00:00:16.770> here<00:00:16.980> I

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:17.010 
an oven is because of gelatin now here I

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:19.090 
an oven is because of gelatin now here I
use<00:00:17.250> gelatin<00:00:17.550> sheets<00:00:17.910> but<00:00:18.210> you<00:00:18.359> can<00:00:18.539> also<00:00:18.690> use

00:00:19.090 --> 00:00:19.100 
use gelatin sheets but you can also use

00:00:19.100 --> 00:00:21.529 
use gelatin sheets but you can also use
powdered<00:00:20.100> gelatin<00:00:20.550> and<00:00:20.730> the<00:00:21.000> conversion

00:00:21.529 --> 00:00:21.539 
powdered gelatin and the conversion

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:23.599 
powdered gelatin and the conversion
between<00:00:22.170> the<00:00:22.500> two<00:00:22.710> is<00:00:22.740> on<00:00:23.010> the<00:00:23.100> back<00:00:23.279> of<00:00:23.310> the

00:00:23.599 --> 00:00:23.609 
between the two is on the back of the

00:00:23.609 --> 00:00:26.540 
between the two is on the back of the
container<00:00:24.590> but<00:00:25.590> in<00:00:25.680> this<00:00:25.769> case<00:00:26.010> you<00:00:26.070> can<00:00:26.369> buy

00:00:26.540 --> 00:00:26.550 
container but in this case you can buy

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:28.400 
container but in this case you can buy
this<00:00:26.609> some<00:00:27.119> specialty<00:00:27.599> markets<00:00:28.019> and<00:00:28.199> what<00:00:28.289> you

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:28.410 
this some specialty markets and what you

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:30.050 
this some specialty markets and what you
have<00:00:28.529> to<00:00:28.650> do<00:00:28.769> because<00:00:29.070> it's<00:00:29.160> a<00:00:29.369> dried<00:00:29.609> product

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:30.060 
have to do because it's a dried product

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:31.700 
have to do because it's a dried product
is<00:00:30.179> you<00:00:30.300> have<00:00:30.449> to<00:00:30.570> hydrate<00:00:30.900> it<00:00:31.260> in<00:00:31.349> some<00:00:31.529> ice

00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:31.710 
is you have to hydrate it in some ice

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:34.130 
is you have to hydrate it in some ice
water<00:00:32.040> which<00:00:32.730> I've<00:00:32.850> already<00:00:32.940> done<00:00:33.270> here<00:00:33.630> it's

00:00:34.130 --> 00:00:34.140 
water which I've already done here it's

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:35.810 
water which I've already done here it's
called<00:00:34.320> blooming<00:00:34.800> when<00:00:35.130> you<00:00:35.250> bloom<00:00:35.460> the<00:00:35.610> gels

00:00:35.810 --> 00:00:35.820 
called blooming when you bloom the gels

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:37.729 
called blooming when you bloom the gels
and<00:00:35.969> it<00:00:36.090> rehydrates<00:00:36.390> itself<00:00:37.020> and<00:00:37.170> become<00:00:37.410> soft

00:00:37.729 --> 00:00:37.739 
and it rehydrates itself and become soft

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:40.610 
and it rehydrates itself and become soft
and<00:00:38.040> what<00:00:38.820> we've<00:00:38.969> done<00:00:39.149> is<00:00:39.390> we<00:00:39.570> have<00:00:39.780> our<00:00:39.989> 8

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:40.620 
and what we've done is we have our 8

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:42.500 
and what we've done is we have our 8
ounces<00:00:41.040> of<00:00:41.190> cream<00:00:41.370> cheese<00:00:41.430> already<00:00:42.030> over<00:00:42.329> here

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:42.510 
ounces of cream cheese already over here

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:45.740 
ounces of cream cheese already over here
on<00:00:42.629> the<00:00:42.719> stove<00:00:42.989> and<00:00:44.480> essentially<00:00:45.480> I'm<00:00:45.600> going

00:00:45.740 --> 00:00:45.750 
on the stove and essentially I'm going

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:47.229 
on the stove and essentially I'm going
to<00:00:45.809> remove<00:00:46.110> that<00:00:46.170> from<00:00:46.530> the<00:00:46.620> boiling<00:00:47.010> water

00:00:47.229 --> 00:00:47.239 
to remove that from the boiling water

00:00:47.239 --> 00:00:51.770 
to remove that from the boiling water
which<00:00:48.239> is<00:00:48.390> already<00:00:48.719> nice<00:00:48.989> and<00:00:49.020> hot<00:00:50.000> and<00:00:51.000> I'm

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:51.780 
which is already nice and hot and I'm

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:53.119 
which is already nice and hot and I'm
going<00:00:51.930> to<00:00:51.960> just<00:00:52.170> squeeze<00:00:52.379> the<00:00:52.680> water<00:00:52.860> out<00:00:53.010> of

00:00:53.119 --> 00:00:53.129 
going to just squeeze the water out of

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:56.209 
going to just squeeze the water out of
the<00:00:53.340> softened<00:00:53.730> gelatin<00:00:54.210> to<00:00:54.860> make<00:00:55.860> sure<00:00:56.039> that

00:00:56.209 --> 00:00:56.219 
the softened gelatin to make sure that

00:00:56.219 --> 00:00:58.400 
the softened gelatin to make sure that
it's<00:00:56.489> we're<00:00:57.449> not<00:00:57.539> adding<00:00:57.750> water<00:00:58.050> into<00:00:58.320> the

00:00:58.400 --> 00:00:58.410 
it's we're not adding water into the

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:03.590 
it's we're not adding water into the
actual<00:00:58.710> dessert<00:00:59.550> so<00:01:00.420> at<00:01:00.539> this<00:01:00.690> point<00:01:02.449> I'll<00:01:03.449> go

00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:03.600 
actual dessert so at this point I'll go

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:06.109 
actual dessert so at this point I'll go
ahead<00:01:03.690> and<00:01:03.890> take<00:01:04.890> a<00:01:04.949> whisk<00:01:05.250> and<00:01:05.549> I'll<00:01:05.909> just

00:01:06.109 --> 00:01:06.119 
ahead and take a whisk and I'll just

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:09.679 
ahead and take a whisk and I'll just
whisk<00:01:06.570> in<00:01:06.960> that<00:01:07.409> soften<00:01:07.890> gelatin<00:01:08.369> and<00:01:08.610> you<00:01:09.540> can

00:01:09.679 --> 00:01:09.689 
whisk in that soften gelatin and you can

00:01:09.689 --> 00:01:11.570 
whisk in that soften gelatin and you can
see<00:01:09.960> with<00:01:10.350> that<00:01:10.380> residual<00:01:10.890> heat<00:01:11.189> left<00:01:11.400> over

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:11.580 
see with that residual heat left over

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:13.550 
see with that residual heat left over
from<00:01:11.909> the<00:01:12.119> double<00:01:12.570> boiler<00:01:12.750> that<00:01:12.930> we<00:01:13.140> created

00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:13.560 
from the double boiler that we created

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:15.740 
from the double boiler that we created
over<00:01:13.770> the<00:01:13.890> stove<00:01:14.159> the<00:01:14.970> gelatin<00:01:15.360> that<00:01:15.509> starts

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:15.750 
over the stove the gelatin that starts

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:18.109 
over the stove the gelatin that starts
to<00:01:15.900> dissolve<00:01:16.070> this<00:01:17.070> particular<00:01:17.369> recipe<00:01:17.670> calls

00:01:18.109 --> 00:01:18.119 
to dissolve this particular recipe calls

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:20.450 
to dissolve this particular recipe calls
for<00:01:18.240> one<00:01:18.600> and<00:01:18.750> a<00:01:18.780> half<00:01:18.810> sheets<00:01:19.290> of<00:01:19.530> the<00:01:20.009> gelatin

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:20.460 
for one and a half sheets of the gelatin

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:22.429 
for one and a half sheets of the gelatin
once<00:01:20.850> you've<00:01:21.030> listed<00:01:21.299> and<00:01:21.630> the<00:01:21.960> gelatin<00:01:22.350> is

00:01:22.429 --> 00:01:22.439 
once you've listed and the gelatin is

00:01:22.439 --> 00:01:25.460 
once you've listed and the gelatin is
completely<00:01:22.880> dissolved<00:01:24.110> we<00:01:25.110> can<00:01:25.229> allow<00:01:25.409> that

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:25.470 
completely dissolved we can allow that

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:26.990 
completely dissolved we can allow that
to<00:01:25.650> rest<00:01:25.979> for<00:01:26.189> a<00:01:26.250> second<00:01:26.610> while<00:01:26.700> we<00:01:26.759> add<00:01:26.970> our

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:27.000 
to rest for a second while we add our

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:28.940 
to rest for a second while we add our
other<00:01:27.270> ingredients<00:01:27.450> which<00:01:28.080> is<00:01:28.229> our<00:01:28.380> 1<00:01:28.560> cup<00:01:28.829> of

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:28.950 
other ingredients which is our 1 cup of

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:34.789 
other ingredients which is our 1 cup of
sour<00:01:29.460> cream<00:01:29.820> to<00:01:30.090> our<00:01:30.210> electric<00:01:30.600> mixer<00:01:33.799> it's

00:01:34.789 --> 00:01:34.799 
sour cream to our electric mixer it's

00:01:34.799 --> 00:01:36.530 
sour cream to our electric mixer it's
best<00:01:35.040> to<00:01:35.159> keep<00:01:35.310> this<00:01:35.520> at<00:01:35.729> a<00:01:35.759> chill<00:01:36.060> temperature

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:36.540 
best to keep this at a chill temperature

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:39.410 
best to keep this at a chill temperature
prior<00:01:36.780> to<00:01:36.930> using<00:01:37.140> it<00:01:37.400> it<00:01:38.400> allows<00:01:38.670> the<00:01:38.909> cream<00:01:39.180> to

00:01:39.410 --> 00:01:39.420 
prior to using it it allows the cream to

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:42.980 
prior to using it it allows the cream to
react<00:01:39.990> and<00:01:40.290> will<00:01:40.829> whip<00:01:41.130> quicker<00:01:41.750> if<00:01:42.750> heavy

00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:42.990 
react and will whip quicker if heavy

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:45.469 
react and will whip quicker if heavy
cream<00:01:43.290> drops<00:01:44.130> in<00:01:44.340> temperature<00:01:44.520> it<00:01:44.970> has<00:01:45.450> a

00:01:45.469 --> 00:01:45.479 
cream drops in temperature it has a

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:48.710 
cream drops in temperature it has a
harder<00:01:45.810> time<00:01:45.990> building<00:01:46.409> its<00:01:46.590> volume<00:01:47.630> so<00:01:48.630> we'll

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:48.720 
harder time building its volume so we'll

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:49.999 
harder time building its volume so we'll
go<00:01:48.810> ahead<00:01:48.869> and<00:01:49.079> put<00:01:49.380> our<00:01:49.409> whip<00:01:49.799> whip

00:01:49.999 --> 00:01:50.009 
go ahead and put our whip whip

00:01:50.009 --> 00:01:52.399 
go ahead and put our whip whip
attachment<00:01:50.159> to<00:01:50.670> our<00:01:50.700> electric<00:01:51.119> mixer<00:01:51.409> we'll

we'll<00:02:55.209> do<00:02:55.330> a<00:02:55.360> fancy<00:02:55.810> thing<00:02:56.019> called<00:02:56.920> folding

00:02:57.420 --> 00:02:57.430 
we'll do a fancy thing called folding

00:02:57.430 --> 00:03:02.600 
we'll do a fancy thing called folding
and<00:02:57.610> we'll<00:02:57.940> fold<00:02:58.239> in<00:02:58.590> this<00:02:59.640> partially<00:03:00.640> whipped

00:03:02.600 --> 00:03:02.610 
and we'll fold in this partially whipped

00:03:02.610 --> 00:03:05.550 
and we'll fold in this partially whipped
but<00:03:03.610> just<00:03:03.850> about<00:03:04.090> a<00:03:04.360> third<00:03:04.870> of<00:03:04.989> it<00:03:05.110> will<00:03:05.319> go<00:03:05.440> in

00:03:05.550 --> 00:03:05.560 
but just about a third of it will go in

00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:09.150 
but just about a third of it will go in
first<00:03:07.470> then<00:03:08.470> we'll<00:03:08.590> whisk<00:03:08.799> this<00:03:08.980> together

00:03:09.150 --> 00:03:09.160 
first then we'll whisk this together

00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:11.280 
first then we'll whisk this together
smooth<00:03:09.760> and<00:03:09.970> once<00:03:10.150> that's<00:03:10.299> doing<00:03:10.810> is<00:03:10.959> we<00:03:11.140> have

00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:11.290 
smooth and once that's doing is we have

00:03:11.290 --> 00:03:13.140 
smooth and once that's doing is we have
a<00:03:11.320> cold<00:03:11.680> mixture<00:03:12.070> with<00:03:12.250> a<00:03:12.280> warm<00:03:12.579> mixture<00:03:12.880> and

00:03:13.140 --> 00:03:13.150 
a cold mixture with a warm mixture and

00:03:13.150 --> 00:03:15.720 
a cold mixture with a warm mixture and
this<00:03:13.750> will<00:03:13.930> allow<00:03:14.079> any<00:03:14.860> lumps<00:03:15.220> to<00:03:15.370> get<00:03:15.489> worked

00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:15.730 
this will allow any lumps to get worked

00:03:15.730 --> 00:03:20.910 
this will allow any lumps to get worked
out<00:03:18.900> you<00:03:19.900> don't<00:03:20.019> want<00:03:20.230> to<00:03:20.290> bite<00:03:20.410> into<00:03:20.680> your<00:03:20.799> non

00:03:20.910 --> 00:03:20.920 
out you don't want to bite into your non

00:03:20.920 --> 00:03:22.289 
out you don't want to bite into your non
baked<00:03:21.130> cheese<00:03:21.340> you<00:03:21.549> can<00:03:21.700> have<00:03:21.880> chunks<00:03:22.209> of

00:03:22.289 --> 00:03:22.299 
baked cheese you can have chunks of

00:03:22.299 --> 00:03:24.420 
baked cheese you can have chunks of
cream<00:03:22.540> cheese<00:03:22.570> or<00:03:23.440> gelatin<00:03:23.829> for<00:03:24.100> that<00:03:24.190> matter

00:03:24.420 --> 00:03:24.430 
cream cheese or gelatin for that matter

00:03:24.430 --> 00:03:26.729 
cream cheese or gelatin for that matter
so<00:03:24.730> it's<00:03:25.600> crucial<00:03:25.810> at<00:03:26.079> this<00:03:26.109> point<00:03:26.470> to<00:03:26.590> make

00:03:26.729 --> 00:03:26.739 
so it's crucial at this point to make

00:03:26.739 --> 00:03:28.800 
so it's crucial at this point to make
sure<00:03:26.890> there's<00:03:27.100> no<00:03:27.280> lumps<00:03:27.579> and<00:03:28.510> there's<00:03:28.660> no

00:03:28.800 --> 00:03:28.810 
sure there's no lumps and there's no

00:03:28.810 --> 00:03:33.840 
sure there's no lumps and there's no
undissolved<00:03:29.260> gelatin<00:03:32.340> at<00:03:33.340> that<00:03:33.519> point<00:03:33.760> you

00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:33.850 
undissolved gelatin at that point you

00:03:33.850 --> 00:03:36.330 
undissolved gelatin at that point you
can<00:03:34.060> add<00:03:34.209> the<00:03:34.359> remaining<00:03:34.829> soft<00:03:35.829> peak<00:03:36.130> whipped

00:03:36.330 --> 00:03:36.340 
can add the remaining soft peak whipped

00:03:36.340 --> 00:03:38.729 
can add the remaining soft peak whipped
mixture<00:03:36.760> which<00:03:37.480> again<00:03:37.720> is<00:03:37.780> just<00:03:37.870> our<00:03:38.200> sugar<00:03:38.500> or

00:03:38.729 --> 00:03:38.739 
mixture which again is just our sugar or

00:03:48.690 --> 00:03:48.700 
easy recipe it's also very clean you're

00:03:48.700 --> 00:03:51.330 
easy recipe it's also very clean you're
not<00:03:48.820> dealing<00:03:49.000> with<00:03:49.209> eggs<00:03:49.510> and<00:03:50.130> what<00:03:51.130> we<00:03:51.220> do<00:03:51.310> is

00:03:51.330 --> 00:03:51.340 
not dealing with eggs and what we do is

00:03:51.340 --> 00:03:53.160 
not dealing with eggs and what we do is
we<00:03:51.549> fold<00:03:51.850> and<00:03:52.180> folding<00:03:52.510> is<00:03:52.600> just<00:03:52.780> a<00:03:52.870> gentle

00:03:53.160 --> 00:03:53.170 
we fold and folding is just a gentle

00:03:53.170 --> 00:03:54.780 
we fold and folding is just a gentle
technique<00:03:53.560> that's<00:03:53.799> done<00:03:53.980> by<00:03:54.130> the<00:03:54.190> wrist<00:03:54.489> and

00:03:54.780 --> 00:03:54.790 
technique that's done by the wrist and

00:03:54.790 --> 00:03:56.670 
technique that's done by the wrist and
we're<00:03:55.390> taking<00:03:55.720> going<00:03:55.900> in<00:03:56.109> from<00:03:56.260> the<00:03:56.350> center

00:03:56.670 --> 00:03:56.680 
we're taking going in from the center

00:03:56.680 --> 00:03:58.770 
we're taking going in from the center
and<00:03:57.010> we're<00:03:57.310> just<00:03:57.430> folding<00:03:58.359> that<00:03:58.480> mixture

00:03:58.770 --> 00:03:58.780 
and we're just folding that mixture

00:03:58.780 --> 00:04:00.539 
and we're just folding that mixture
until<00:03:58.959> it's<00:03:59.260> fully<00:03:59.470> incorporated<00:04:00.040> cleaning
