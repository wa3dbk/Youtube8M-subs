00:00:07.990 --> 00:00:14.879
 hello welcome back to your space 

00:00:11.519 --> 00:00:17.919
 of products preste pride de presto 

00:00:14.879 --> 00:00:20.610
 now let's elaborate what is a 

00:00:17.919 --> 00:00:24.460
 gelatin using our products 

00:00:20.610 --> 00:00:28.869
 strawberry frosting chocolate frosting 

00:00:24.460 --> 00:00:30.429
 and 3 creams our syrup to make 

00:00:28.869 --> 00:00:32.529
 a gelatin 

00:00:30.429 --> 00:00:36.030
 let's make a marbled jelly 

00:00:32.529 --> 00:00:38.430
 we need a mold 

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:41.789
 half a liter of chocolate frosting 

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:45.870
 half a liter of strawberry frosting and a 

00:00:41.789 --> 00:00:49.410
 liter of syrup three creams 

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:52.320
 and clear 30 grams of grenetine per liter 

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:53.699
 that we are going to use only you still have 

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:55.350
 that we are going to use the procedure 

00:00:53.699 --> 00:00:58.700
 will be 

00:00:55.350 --> 00:01:05.290
 let's warm up 

00:00:58.700 --> 00:01:05.290
 the frosting of strawberry we are going to heat 

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:13.450
 up to boiling point or about to 

00:01:10.040 --> 00:01:16.810
 boil let's be 

00:01:13.450 --> 00:01:19.299
 heating our creams our cream 

00:01:16.810 --> 00:01:22.750
 We will be heating it for that already 

00:01:19.299 --> 00:01:26.170
 we have hydrated our grenetina 30 

00:01:22.750 --> 00:01:29.290
 grams of grenetine with 150 milliliters 

00:01:26.170 --> 00:01:32.890
 of water we are adapting 

00:01:29.290 --> 00:01:35.050
 since we are heating our cream 

00:01:32.890 --> 00:01:36.750
 let's add our half liter of 

00:01:35.050 --> 00:01:38.390
 milk 

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:40.720
 yes 

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:43.280
 but to make us stay better 

00:01:40.720 --> 00:01:46.520
 consistency and better taste let's 

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:48.350
 add what is the greenery before 

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:50.590
 that dissolves or we're going to add the 

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:50.590
 grenetina 

00:01:50.910 --> 00:01:54.860
 previously heated since we had 

00:01:53.110 --> 00:01:58.580
 hydrous 

00:01:54.860 --> 00:02:03.460
 we add you we are going to incorporate 

00:01:58.580 --> 00:02:03.460
 incorporate until melted 

00:02:04.409 --> 00:02:11.030
 is going to melt the grenetina 

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:13.760
 and since it melted it will be very 

00:02:11.030 --> 00:02:18.040
 well with a very nice consistency and 

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:18.040
 We are going to add the syrup three creams 

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:25.580
 we have the syrup three creams our 

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:28.040
 half a liter we have here 

00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:31.269
 but let's incorporate 

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:31.269
 little by little 

00:02:35.710 --> 00:02:41.080
 and here we have record by masters we are going to 

00:02:38.170 --> 00:02:44.610
 come previously until it is incorporated 

00:02:41.080 --> 00:02:44.610
 well our syrup three creams 

00:02:48.569 --> 00:02:55.249
 either with a little stick or we will use 

00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:55.249
 also a beater 

00:03:10.510 --> 00:03:15.209
 since it was incorporated we're going to 

00:03:15.230 --> 00:03:21.129
 incorporating our gelatin mold 

00:03:34.319 --> 00:03:39.599
 and it is fixed between the color and the pink 

00:03:36.780 --> 00:03:42.930
 we do not need to make color and someone 

00:03:39.599 --> 00:03:46.340
 with its flavor and concentrated color what 

00:03:42.930 --> 00:03:46.340
 only one that is needed rich 

00:03:51.090 --> 00:03:55.709
 Now what are we going to do? 

00:03:52.980 --> 00:03:58.709
 put the refrigeration for about 20 o 

00:03:55.709 --> 00:04:01.319
 30 minutes and then we're going to 

00:03:58.709 --> 00:04:04.830
 do the same procedure but now 

00:04:01.319 --> 00:04:07.500
 with chocolate frosting we are going to 

00:04:04.830 --> 00:04:11.340
 use half a liter of chocolate and 

00:04:07.500 --> 00:04:12.870
 half a liter of syrup 3 creams equal 30 

00:04:11.340 --> 00:04:15.269
 grams of grenetine let's make a 

00:04:12.870 --> 00:04:17.729
 procedure already for when set 

00:04:15.269 --> 00:04:19.650
 our strawberry gelatin and that of 

00:04:17.729 --> 00:04:22.100
 chocolate we are going to incorporate 

00:04:19.650 --> 00:04:22.100
 above 

00:04:22.150 --> 00:04:25.889
 let's put it refrigerated 

00:04:30.520 --> 00:04:35.020
 since we made our two 

00:04:32.650 --> 00:04:38.259
 combinations of chocolate and strawberry and 

00:04:35.020 --> 00:04:40.750
 We had to poke welcomes when refrigerating and 

00:04:38.259 --> 00:04:42.879
 after three hours you can already 

00:04:40.750 --> 00:04:45.729
 feel if we raise our gelatin and 

00:04:42.879 --> 00:04:48.150
 with a stable consistency all here 

00:04:45.729 --> 00:04:51.150
 and what we are going to do is unmold the 

00:04:48.150 --> 00:04:55.500
 let's put it in hot water 

00:04:51.150 --> 00:04:55.500
 about three seconds 

00:04:56.240 --> 00:05:01.820
 and it took off 

00:04:58.760 --> 00:05:04.930
 so here we are going to put what we are going to 

00:05:01.820 --> 00:05:04.930
 put on a plate 

00:05:06.620 --> 00:05:13.269
 and we put it on the plate 

00:05:09.409 --> 00:05:13.269
 we are already focusing it well 

00:05:13.520 --> 00:05:18.069
 since we have it we are going to unmold 

00:05:18.249 --> 00:05:24.800
 and so would our gelatin 

00:05:21.320 --> 00:05:27.080
 of three creams with presto products and 

00:05:24.800 --> 00:05:29.470
 chocolate frosting and frosting 

00:05:27.080 --> 00:05:29.470
 Strawberry 

00:05:32.569 --> 00:05:39.219
 a rich and appetizing jelly with 

00:05:36.020 --> 00:05:39.219
 presto products 

00:05:44.849 --> 00:05:50.789
 then you know how to use products 

00:05:47.580 --> 00:05:53.520
 presto and this would be all for today and the 

00:05:50.789 --> 00:05:55.229
 we wait in our next capsule and 

00:05:53.520 --> 00:05:57.800
 here in your space of prime plastic 

00:05:55.229 --> 00:05:57.800
 presto
