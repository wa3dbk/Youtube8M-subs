00:00:01.890 --> 00:00:04.310
 ah 

00:00:06.420 --> 00:00:10.230
 ah 

00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:13.590
 my name how much salt Gonzalez and nel am 

00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:15.790
 Spanish and I wanted to tell you about the 

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:18.230
 beautiful 

00:00:15.790 --> 00:00:20.840
 johnson prices 

00:00:18.230 --> 00:00:23.509
 a new way of interpreting shadows 

00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:24.890
 with an excellent shine in many of the 

00:00:23.509 --> 00:00:28.009
 cases for example like this that I'm 

00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:29.980
 using that is this bronze color 

00:00:28.009 --> 00:00:32.860
 pale 

00:00:29.980 --> 00:00:35.050
 it is more a metallic shine slightly 

00:00:32.860 --> 00:00:40.950
 less bright than the rest what I'm going 

00:00:35.050 --> 00:00:40.950
 to do is besiege the eye with this tone 

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:47.350
 in a fairly quite equal way the 

00:00:44.780 --> 00:00:47.350
 I have to say 

00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:55.300
 and we're going to start accentuating to create a 

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:55.300
 little dimension and effect 

00:00:55.800 --> 00:01:02.300
 see lots of precision you will see that it has 

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:04.559
 different tones as you can 

00:01:02.300 --> 00:01:07.080
 perfectly adjust to our look to 

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:09.800
 your rhythm of life and I believe that a 

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:09.800
 way not to err 

00:01:10.150 --> 00:01:16.260
 and you feel identified with the color 

00:01:12.660 --> 00:01:16.260
 of these shadows 

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:20.820
 I'm going to give you a little bit just 

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:22.950
 of dimension 

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:24.430
 adding a little bit of dark here the 

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:26.970
 minimum 

00:01:24.430 --> 00:01:26.970
 Y 

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:35.710
 I'm going to apply another type of texture that 

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:39.610
 has this shadow and are these 

00:01:35.710 --> 00:01:39.610
 wonderful pigments 

00:01:40.030 --> 00:01:46.479
 and who create this this zeros effect or 

00:01:43.659 --> 00:01:49.210
 wet what I 'm going to do is blur it 

00:01:46.479 --> 00:01:51.009
 down for this I recommend that you 

00:01:49.210 --> 00:01:55.080
 please do not have any kind of 

00:01:51.009 --> 00:01:57.540
 fear the pale bronze color 

00:01:55.080 --> 00:02:00.830
 down without fear set the line 

00:01:57.540 --> 00:02:00.830
 that is trace 

00:02:01.540 --> 00:02:06.180
 and that is basically the continuation of 

00:02:03.760 --> 00:02:06.180
 the eyebrow 

00:02:07.610 --> 00:02:14.860
 and I'm going to extend it to the part 

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:18.160
 below I use my fingers just to 

00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:21.730
 give it some movement and 

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:21.730
 remove definition 

00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:35.700
 I will add this color 

00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:35.700
 silver and I'm going to add it slightly 

00:02:37.060 --> 00:02:44.010
 set is a stroke out a stroke 

00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:55.480
 finally a touch of clarito 

00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:55.480
 on the inside of the mobile eyelid 

00:02:56.200 --> 00:03:01.660
 you see how many different types 

00:02:58.270 --> 00:03:03.480
 of brightness one is more humid the other is 

00:03:01.660 --> 00:03:05.700
 even more 

00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:08.550
 + gloss 

00:03:05.700 --> 00:03:10.650
 others are simply metallic in 

00:03:08.550 --> 00:03:13.830
 Regarding mask, I recommend you 

00:03:10.650 --> 00:03:15.209
 apply very very very very little the only 

00:03:13.830 --> 00:03:17.810
 that I am going to apply is almost in a way 

00:03:15.209 --> 00:03:20.739
 symbolic for 

00:03:17.810 --> 00:03:20.739
 darken 

00:03:21.170 --> 00:03:24.130
 juanjo tango of the 

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:33.270
 notice that it is an appreciable chick 

00:03:39.160 --> 00:03:43.060
 good 

00:03:40.720 --> 00:03:45.550
 here you have a more delicious option 

00:03:43.060 --> 00:03:47.410
 but remember that vÃ©lez precision I hope 

00:03:45.550 --> 00:03:49.920
 that you liked it because to me 

00:03:47.410 --> 00:03:49.920
 love
