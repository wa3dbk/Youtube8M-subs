there are four spool caps now these
bigger<00:00:56.969> cones<00:00:57.390> are<00:00:57.809> meant<00:00:58.379> to<00:00:58.469> go<00:00:58.680> underneath

00:00:59.060 --> 00:00:59.070 
bigger cones are meant to go underneath

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:01.430 
bigger cones are meant to go underneath
your<00:00:59.370> larger<00:00:59.879> serger<00:01:00.329> cones<00:01:00.629> what<00:01:01.079> I'll<00:01:01.170> do<00:01:01.350> is

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:01.440 
your larger serger cones what I'll do is

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:02.660 
your larger serger cones what I'll do is
just<00:01:01.469> go<00:01:01.680> up<00:01:01.829> through<00:01:02.100> the<00:01:02.190> middle<00:01:02.399> and

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:02.670 
just go up through the middle and

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:04.310 
just go up through the middle and
they'll<00:01:02.789> stabilize<00:01:03.090> these<00:01:03.600> from<00:01:03.899> wiggling

00:01:04.310 --> 00:01:04.320 
they'll stabilize these from wiggling

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:05.929 
they'll stabilize these from wiggling
around<00:01:04.619> or<00:01:04.829> leaning<00:01:05.219> to<00:01:05.369> the<00:01:05.399> side<00:01:05.519> which

00:01:05.929 --> 00:01:05.939 
around or leaning to the side which

00:01:05.939 --> 00:01:07.940 
around or leaning to the side which
makes<00:01:06.179> the<00:01:06.359> thread<00:01:06.569> hard<00:01:07.109> to<00:01:07.229> pull<00:01:07.469> off<00:01:07.499> if

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:07.950 
makes the thread hard to pull off if

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:09.649 
makes the thread hard to pull off if
that's<00:01:08.219> the<00:01:08.459> case<00:01:08.670> and<00:01:08.969> then<00:01:09.299> if<00:01:09.389> you<00:01:09.479> can't

00:01:09.649 --> 00:01:09.659 
that's the case and then if you can't

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:11.660 
that's the case and then if you can't
find<00:01:09.929> them<00:01:10.139> well<00:01:10.499> they're<00:01:10.889> probably<00:01:11.130> stuck<00:01:11.459> up

00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:11.670 
find them well they're probably stuck up

00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:45.150 
they'll keep the thread still going up

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:47.449 
they'll keep the thread still going up
off<00:02:45.329> the<00:02:45.540> cone<00:02:45.780> but<00:02:46.200> without<00:02:46.500> them<00:02:47.010> falling

00:02:47.449 --> 00:02:47.459
