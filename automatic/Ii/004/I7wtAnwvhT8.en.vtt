00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.390
 The installation space must be for the 

00:00:02.100 --> 00:00:07.859
 Assembling necessarily be flat 

00:00:05.390 --> 00:00:10.500
 all get loud elements become like that 

00:00:07.859 --> 00:00:12.719
 put together that the connection / 4 

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:15.450
 and lax number three are considered 

00:00:12.719 --> 00:00:16.859
 then over la blanche number two and as 

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:19.080
 top flap number 1 

00:00:16.859 --> 00:00:21.060
 The tab number is also in the form of 

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:23.449
 score on the jackpot elements 

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:23.449
 visible 

00:00:27.360 --> 00:00:31.630
 the kloten demente will be with one 

00:00:30.010 --> 00:00:33.400
 connecting construction connected 

00:00:31.630 --> 00:00:36.690
 and this is with the help of funds 

00:00:33.400 --> 00:00:39.040
 force pushed through the mesh 

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:40.680
 with the fitting key will be the 

00:00:39.040 --> 00:00:48.250
 connecting bolt with a jerky 

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:50.140
 rotary motion locks the bolts 

00:00:48.250 --> 00:00:52.750
 lock takes place to the left or 

00:00:50.140 --> 00:00:54.220
 to the right the unlocking and the 

00:00:52.750 --> 00:00:56.670
 Assembly is done in reverse 

00:00:54.220 --> 00:00:56.670
 sequence 

00:00:57.150 --> 00:01:02.670
 the holes of the connection wanted 

00:00:59.590 --> 00:01:05.290
 pointing in a direction 

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:08.640
 this will lock with the help of water 

00:01:05.290 --> 00:01:11.140
 the connection paulson facilitates 

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:12.700
 between the chat lot double elements 

00:01:11.140 --> 00:01:13.660
 must distinguish a double distance 

00:01:12.700 --> 00:01:16.149
 be inserted 

00:01:13.660 --> 00:01:21.369
 otherwise the assembly takes place via 

00:01:16.149 --> 00:01:23.649
 the catwalk single elements in 

00:01:21.369 --> 00:01:26.020
 staggered design of jet flew double 

00:01:23.649 --> 00:01:27.759
 Elements must be individually on this length 

00:01:26.020 --> 00:01:29.920
 distance to be placed 

00:01:27.759 --> 00:01:32.110
 the first row consists of double 

00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:34.119
 elements the second series begins with 

00:01:32.110 --> 00:01:36.100
 a single element and you drive with 

00:01:34.119 --> 00:01:40.649
 double elements continue to the end 

00:01:36.100 --> 00:01:40.649
 again a single element is placed 

00:01:41.759 --> 00:01:47.190
 the third row is just out again 

00:01:44.410 --> 00:01:47.190
 double elements 

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:59.820
 when installed in two layers leaves 

00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:02.610
 you just second short connection 

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:04.290
 Bolton in a must put away in 

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:06.180
 The upper platform will be the short one 

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:08.790
 connecting bolt in the same 

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:10.470
 positions used as keep and 

00:02:08.790 --> 00:02:12.380
 the long connecting bolts will be in 

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:14.640
 the open positions used 

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:16.260
 the end of the bay at the long 

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:18.330
 connection bolt must be with a 

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:21.500
 Lubricants are sprayed around the 

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:21.500
 to allow locking 

00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:34.590
 the montage of a chat float facility 

00:02:32.490 --> 00:02:46.470
 always takes the manageable first 

00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:48.180
 Part of the land 

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:50.250
 preassembled paul platforms 

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:52.530
 pushed into the water or lifted 

00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:55.820
 at the longest assembly doubly 

00:02:52.530 --> 00:02:55.820
 Do not forget spacers
