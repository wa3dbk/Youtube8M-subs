00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.570
 because the other day I was trying 

00:00:01.800 --> 00:00:06.000
 tell them how he called me how to 

00:00:03.570 --> 00:00:09.120
 pronounced my name and I tell them jimena 

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:11.510
 and they tell me nothing like a magnet and I eat 

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:11.510
 magnet 

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:28.300
 I'm rid of another one of my colds 

00:00:24.970 --> 00:00:31.900
 that gives me one as with each station yet 

00:00:28.300 --> 00:00:34.480
 I'm here with you to talk together 

00:00:31.900 --> 00:00:37.900
 although it sounds a bit like that 

00:00:34.480 --> 00:00:39.400
 drive merchant trucks or sideways 

00:00:37.900 --> 00:00:41.140
 I can not laugh either because if I laugh 

00:00:39.400 --> 00:00:43.330
 I get hit by everyone so why 

00:00:41.140 --> 00:00:45.309
 please today we have to be serious not 

00:00:43.330 --> 00:00:46.780
 we can laugh this is going to be very 

00:00:45.309 --> 00:00:49.600
 difficult so we better go to 

00:00:46.780 --> 00:00:51.040
 focus on talking about three things with the 

00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:53.620
 that you have to be very careful 

00:00:51.040 --> 00:00:55.870
 because if you're doing any or 

00:00:53.620 --> 00:00:58.750
 the three of them you can be 

00:00:55.870 --> 00:01:01.479
 causing alopecia without wanting to 

00:00:58.750 --> 00:01:04.239
 Sometimes there are many types but there are 

00:01:01.479 --> 00:01:06.159
 one like the one I suffer from, but if not 

00:01:04.239 --> 00:01:08.170
 you know me, you do not believe it but I 

00:01:06.159 --> 00:01:10.240
 you know you know that's how he suffers from 

00:01:08.170 --> 00:01:12.220
 Androgenetic alopecia plus one of 

00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:15.310
 the most aggressive during my 

00:01:12.220 --> 00:01:18.369
 adolescence I lost 50% of my hair 

00:01:15.310 --> 00:01:20.619
 with this I have learned to handle it and how 

00:01:18.369 --> 00:01:22.479
 you see I have recovered great the vast majority 

00:01:20.619 --> 00:01:25.210
 of my hair so you can say that 

00:01:22.479 --> 00:01:26.410
 I know a thing or two about alopecia and 

00:01:25.210 --> 00:01:27.220
 really good alopecia 

00:01:26.410 --> 00:01:28.930
 androgenetic 

00:01:27.220 --> 00:01:30.520
 you can not produce it yourself 

00:01:28.930 --> 00:01:32.530
 to say is one thing that you get or not 

00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:34.000
 you have neither can you cure it because 

00:01:32.530 --> 00:01:36.190
 It is incurable but if it can be improved 

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:39.430
 as you've seen how I'm already 

00:01:36.190 --> 00:01:41.200
 counting but what I'm going to talk about today is 

00:01:39.430 --> 00:01:43.480
 of the type of alopecia that you can 

00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:45.460
 provoke yourself if you're doing three 

00:01:43.480 --> 00:01:48.070
 things that are very common the first 

00:01:45.460 --> 00:01:50.380
 thing is to wear excessive hairstyles 

00:01:48.070 --> 00:01:52.420
 tight every day of your life day 

00:01:50.380 --> 00:01:55.360
 yes day is also fine if one day to the 

00:01:52.420 --> 00:01:58.630
 week but try to avoid it as much as 

00:01:55.360 --> 00:02:00.340
 may the pigtail not be your hairstyle 

00:01:58.630 --> 00:02:03.130
 from day to day the hair is much better 

00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:05.229
 when it's loose and you're not attacking 

00:02:03.130 --> 00:02:07.000
 the bulb because what happens is what is 

00:02:05.229 --> 00:02:09.100
 call alopecia by traction you're 

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:11.530
 constantly putting extensions 

00:02:09.100 --> 00:02:13.150
 cooked nothing those clip that those are 

00:02:11.530 --> 00:02:15.459
 they are practically not going to do any 

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:17.500
 damage but in which they are cooked and others 

00:02:15.459 --> 00:02:20.230
 that are very tight is a traction 

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:22.500
 constant of the bulb and can damage it 

00:02:20.230 --> 00:02:25.300
 can cause hair to fall 

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:27.820
 temporarily but if you do not stop if you do not 

00:02:25.300 --> 00:02:30.069
 you stop doing it as the bulb said 

00:02:27.820 --> 00:02:33.189
 it can be damaged indefinitely and 

00:02:30.069 --> 00:02:36.040
 and forever the other time is if ever 

00:02:33.189 --> 00:02:37.719
 you go to the doctor to see how you are doing 

00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:39.700
 inside because more outside we can be 

00:02:37.719 --> 00:02:42.670
 very beautiful, very impeccable, very beautiful 

00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:45.639
 but if inside we are not well we 

00:02:42.670 --> 00:02:47.530
 we are going to normally generate 

00:02:45.639 --> 00:02:49.239
 alopecia because what happens as soon as 

00:02:47.530 --> 00:02:51.819
 We have a lack of vitamins 

00:02:49.239 --> 00:02:53.620
 we have a lack of some mineral of something 

00:02:51.819 --> 00:02:55.689
 in our body the first thing that our 

00:02:53.620 --> 00:02:58.450
 body will stop nourishing is the hair and 

00:02:55.689 --> 00:03:01.060
 The most common thing in women is usually 

00:02:58.450 --> 00:03:04.450
 be above all anemia is to say the 

00:03:01.060 --> 00:03:06.489
 lack of iron this can cause very 

00:03:04.450 --> 00:03:08.439
 usually very usually the fall 

00:03:06.489 --> 00:03:10.989
 of the hair also the lack of vitamin 

00:03:08.439 --> 00:03:13.090
 d and tell you one thing most of the 

00:03:10.989 --> 00:03:15.519
 people especially women have 

00:03:13.090 --> 00:03:19.120
 lack of vitamin D if it is the vitamin 

00:03:15.519 --> 00:03:20.739
 that the sun gives you but the sun also gives you 

00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:22.989
 it produces cancer therefore today 

00:03:20.739 --> 00:03:24.639
 we protect ourselves so much from the sun that it is 

00:03:22.989 --> 00:03:26.019
 it's better to keep protecting 

00:03:24.639 --> 00:03:28.389
 of the sun because vitamin d can be 

00:03:26.019 --> 00:03:30.549
 take in pills in supplements in 

00:03:28.389 --> 00:03:32.199
 supplements and it's better that you're not 

00:03:30.549 --> 00:03:33.699
 exposing to the sun without protection because 

00:03:32.199 --> 00:03:35.470
 as soon as you expose yourself to the sun with 

00:03:33.699 --> 00:03:36.190
 protection is not generating the vitamin 

00:03:35.470 --> 00:03:38.110
 d 

00:03:36.190 --> 00:03:39.820
 that's what usually happens and we continue 

00:03:38.110 --> 00:03:41.280
 in a country where there is more winter 

00:03:39.820 --> 00:03:43.840
 four months 

00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:46.180
 forget about it and another thing about everything 

00:03:43.840 --> 00:03:47.880
 if you eat a little meat if you are a vegetarian 

00:03:46.180 --> 00:03:50.950
 or if you do a lot of diets it's the vitamin 

00:03:47.880 --> 00:03:53.590
 b12 and folic acid those two usually 

00:03:50.950 --> 00:03:56.080
 Missing a lot when we eat little 

00:03:53.590 --> 00:03:57.580
 amount of animal protein and when 

00:03:56.080 --> 00:04:00.550
 we do many diets is very common in 

00:03:57.580 --> 00:04:02.800
 the women and finally my friend a 

00:04:00.550 --> 00:04:04.990
 fashion has become very fashionable worth 

00:04:02.800 --> 00:04:06.430
 the redundancy that is surely the 

00:04:04.990 --> 00:04:08.140
 you will have heard if you have not heard it now 

00:04:06.430 --> 00:04:10.690
 I'll tell you that it's the notebook 

00:04:08.140 --> 00:04:12.100
 which comes to be no shampoo sound 

00:04:10.690 --> 00:04:13.900
 notebook and also because the shampoo 

00:04:12.100 --> 00:04:15.160
 supposedly because it has many things 

00:04:13.900 --> 00:04:17.650
 bad for the hair and I agree 

00:04:15.160 --> 00:04:19.720
 it is better to use other more natural things 

00:04:17.650 --> 00:04:22.320
 but it's getting a lot a lot a lot 

00:04:19.720 --> 00:04:24.820
 Fashionable do not wash your hair during 

00:04:22.320 --> 00:04:27.220
 many weeks in master plan only 

00:04:24.820 --> 00:04:29.530
 with water or using baking soda and vinegar 

00:04:27.220 --> 00:04:31.000
 the problem with bicarbonate and vinegar 

00:04:29.530 --> 00:04:33.610
 is that the bicarbonate has a ph 

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:36.070
 excessively basic and then you put on 

00:04:33.610 --> 00:04:39.670
 the vinegar supposedly to recover 

00:04:36.070 --> 00:04:41.590
 the balance of the ph and what happens is that 

00:04:39.670 --> 00:04:42.950
 that sudden change between the between 

00:04:41.590 --> 00:04:45.110
 bicarbonate and 

00:04:42.950 --> 00:04:47.570
 it's really a terrible thing to 

00:04:45.110 --> 00:04:49.160
 hair and while the oil 

00:04:47.570 --> 00:04:51.020
 our hair is totally necessary 

00:04:49.160 --> 00:04:52.480
 to keep it healthy yes that is 

00:04:51.020 --> 00:04:55.790
 true that you do not wash your hair 

00:04:52.480 --> 00:04:57.170
 appropriately for weeks what's going 

00:04:55.790 --> 00:04:59.990
 to do is that there will be many 

00:04:57.170 --> 00:05:02.300
 sebum in your hair and sebum is a means 

00:04:59.990 --> 00:05:03.980
 fantastic for the bacteria to be 

00:05:02.300 --> 00:05:06.080
 reproduce and if the bacteria 

00:05:03.980 --> 00:05:08.320
 reproduce they can give you mushrooms 

00:05:06.080 --> 00:05:11.360
 they can give infections by bacteria and 

00:05:08.320 --> 00:05:13.670
 eventually this can cause you a 

00:05:11.360 --> 00:05:15.800
 alopecia so please if you're in 

00:05:13.670 --> 00:05:17.450
 the fashion of the notebook piÃ©nsatelo two 

00:05:15.800 --> 00:05:19.970
 Sometimes it's not going amazing and 

00:05:17.450 --> 00:05:22.340
 know that you have your hair very clean 

00:05:19.970 --> 00:05:24.590
 and it's not you, it does not make you feel anything 

00:05:22.340 --> 00:05:26.270
 badly scalp of anything because 

00:05:24.590 --> 00:05:28.880
 everyone is different but in 

00:05:26.270 --> 00:05:30.200
 general is not a good idea and it's already 

00:05:28.880 --> 00:05:33.800
 my friend this is what I can tell you 

00:05:30.200 --> 00:05:35.330

00:05:49.080 --> 00:05:53.370
