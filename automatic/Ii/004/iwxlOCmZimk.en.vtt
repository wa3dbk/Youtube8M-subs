00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.080
 hello to you andrew andreevich my 

00:00:01.979 --> 00:00:08.160
 channel on youtube all-ru all and we decide 

00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:10.349
 task 301 two point distance 

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:12.269
 between which 40 kilometers to meet 

00:00:10.349 --> 00:00:14.219
 each other went simultaneously 

00:00:12.269 --> 00:00:15.839
 pedestrian and cyclist speed 

00:00:14.219 --> 00:00:17.150
 four times more cyclist 

00:00:15.839 --> 00:00:20.520
 pedestrian speed 

00:00:17.150 --> 00:00:22.380
 find the speed of the pedestrian and 

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:24.199
 cyclist if they know that 

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:28.080
 met in two and a half hours 

00:00:24.199 --> 00:00:32.340
 after its release see we have 

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:34.710
 cyclist and pedestrian who among them 

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:38.309
 moved slower and slower moved 

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:41.360
 Of course, let's get a speed 

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:44.430
 pedestrian denoted by x 

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:48.680
 then the speed of the cyclist can be easily 

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:51.449
 find out if pedestrian speed is x 

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:52.590
 then the cyclist speed is four times 

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:57.719
 more we are told 

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:58.770
 I'll take another pen 

00:00:57.719 --> 00:01:02.609
 pedestrian x 

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:04.830
 then the rider speed is 4x because 

00:01:02.609 --> 00:01:07.799
 what is said that the cyclist was moving in 

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:08.700
 four times faster say xr 

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:12.060
 walking speed 

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:13.979
 then 4x is the speed of the rider 

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:17.700
 because he moved four times 

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:19.979
 need to multiply faster by 4 times they 

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:24.680
 moving towards each other then we can 

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:27.420
 their speeds add up and get total 

00:01:24.680 --> 00:01:30.060
 speed or cumulative speed or 

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:31.439
 total speed in different brackets in 

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:34.829
 different schools call it differently 

00:01:31.439 --> 00:01:36.090
 and so their total speed is a pedestrian let 

00:01:34.829 --> 00:01:39.420
 move at speed x 

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:41.909
 then cyclist speed 4x times they 

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:44.939
 moving towards each other then need 

00:01:41.909 --> 00:01:47.960
 these two speeds add up here their not common 

00:01:44.939 --> 00:01:52.409
 speed at that speed they moved 

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:56.810
 two and a half hours and it is known that 

00:01:52.409 --> 00:01:59.520
 the distance between them was 40 kilometers 

00:01:56.810 --> 00:02:01.380
 same way, if we add up the speed of their 

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:03.509
 this will be their total speed with this is common 

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:07.369
 speed they moved two and a half 

00:02:03.509 --> 00:02:10.440
 hours and met in two full hours 

00:02:07.369 --> 00:02:13.710
 the distance they together overcome 

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:18.090
 cumulatively it's 40 kilometers come on now 

00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:21.810
 5 in brackets first x plus 4x 

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:26.130
 it will be 5 x because 1x and plus 

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:26.820
 4x it will be 5 x 5 x multiply by 2 s 

00:02:26.130 --> 00:02:31.140
 by half 

00:02:26.820 --> 00:02:33.240
 will be 40 well here between the top five x too 

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:35.790
 you can put a sign to multiply sometimes 

00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:37.710
 write 4x sometimes write multiply 4 

00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:40.500
 multiply by x here you could write 

00:02:37.710 --> 00:02:44.790
 5x and you can multiply 5 by x is the same 

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:45.690
 so let's multiply 5 times 

00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:53.430
 2 and a half 

00:02:45.690 --> 00:02:57.540
 x 5 multiplied by 2 and a half will be 12 

00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:59.310
 half I left everything as it was only 

00:02:57.540 --> 00:03:03.960
 five times 2 and a half it will be 

00:02:59.310 --> 00:03:08.190
 12 half x how now x find x 

00:03:03.960 --> 00:03:13.620
 then you can find it in 40 divided by 

00:03:08.190 --> 00:03:18.780
 12 half here so let's 

00:03:13.620 --> 00:03:22.830
 let's divide the column we can not 

00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:24.660
 divide by decimal and therefore 

00:03:22.830 --> 00:03:28.320
 here we put a comma on 1 character to 

00:03:24.660 --> 00:03:31.350
 it was 125 then to 40 you need to add 0 1 

00:03:28.320 --> 00:03:33.900
 that is, we like here too nose when 

00:03:31.350 --> 00:03:37.500
 was the number 40, it was like here and we 

00:03:33.900 --> 00:03:39.960
 put on for it turns out 400 well 

00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:42.150
 or otherwise we can both say 

00:03:39.960 --> 00:03:43.050
 numbers can be multiplied by 10 40 multiply 

00:03:42.150 --> 00:03:45.150
 at 10,400 

00:03:43.050 --> 00:03:49.590
 and 12 half multiplied by ten will be 

00:03:45.150 --> 00:03:54.830
 125 and so we divide 400 by 125 on the take 

00:03:49.590 --> 00:04:01.620
 how many let's take three maybe 3 by 5 

00:03:54.830 --> 00:04:10.010
 15 5 we write 1 in mind 3 for 2 6 to 12 months 73 

00:04:01.620 --> 00:04:12.300
 On 1 this is 3 400 minus 375 will be 25 

00:04:10.010 --> 00:04:15.540
 demolish nothing more so put 

00:04:12.300 --> 00:04:20.630
 here we add a comma and we take zero here 

00:04:15.540 --> 00:04:22.710
 2 2 times 125 will be 250 just 

00:04:20.630 --> 00:04:26.720
 a little bit adjusted to everyone on the decision 

00:04:22.710 --> 00:04:32.250
 one on another and so x then equals 

00:04:26.720 --> 00:04:35.550
 x is equal to 3.2 kilometers an hour we were asked 

00:04:32.250 --> 00:04:38.220
 find find pedestrian speeds and 

00:04:35.550 --> 00:04:39.420
 cyclists pedestrian speed we 

00:04:38.220 --> 00:04:42.330
 so it turned out 

00:04:39.420 --> 00:04:44.970
 and the speed of the cyclist is four times 

00:04:42.330 --> 00:04:48.720
 more started 3.2 

00:04:44.970 --> 00:04:49.320
 multiply by 4 this we got speed 

00:04:48.720 --> 00:04:51.500
 pedestrian 

00:04:49.320 --> 00:04:53.310
 x it was pedestrian speed a 

00:04:51.500 --> 00:04:58.280
 cyclist moves four times 

00:04:53.310 --> 00:05:05.060
 faster so multiply by 4 4 by 2 this 

00:04:58.280 --> 00:05:05.060
 84 by 3 to 12 it turns out 12.8 

00:05:05.390 --> 00:05:09.150
 Here are the speed you get on 

00:05:08.490 --> 00:05:11.190
 that's all 

00:05:09.150 --> 00:05:15.830
 My name is Andrew Andreevich My channel on 

00:05:11.190 --> 00:05:15.830
