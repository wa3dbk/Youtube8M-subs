00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:13.710 
use if you never use it to before I'll

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:16.160

add<00:01:13.950> a<00:01:13.979> link<00:01:14.280> right<00:01:14.490> here<00:01:14.720> the<00:01:15.720> first<00:01:15.930> thing<00:01:16.080> we

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:16.170 
add a link right here the first thing we

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:18.170 
add a link right here the first thing we
do<00:01:16.350> is<00:01:16.380> provide<00:01:16.950> our<00:01:17.189> virtual<00:01:17.580> machine<00:01:17.939> name

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:18.180 
do is provide our virtual machine name

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:20.690 
do is provide our virtual machine name
then<00:01:18.689> will<00:01:18.840> allocate<00:01:19.409> some<00:01:19.680> memory<00:01:19.740> for<00:01:20.490> our

then will allocate some memory for our
virtual<00:01:21.090> machine<00:01:21.360> I'll<00:01:21.630> give<00:01:21.869> it<00:01:21.900> two<00:01:22.200> gigs

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:22.530

00:05:11.810 --> 00:05:11.820 
that happening that I used way too many

00:05:11.820 --> 00:05:13.670 
that happening that I used way too many
applications<00:05:12.540> to<00:05:12.780> be<00:05:12.930> scrolling<00:05:13.380> through

00:05:13.670 --> 00:05:13.680 
applications to be scrolling through

00:05:13.680 --> 00:05:16.070

that<00:05:13.830> Metro<00:05:14.250> user<00:05:14.430> interface<00:05:14.970> the<00:05:15.870> way

00:05:16.070 --> 00:05:16.080 
that Metro user interface the way

00:05:16.080 --> 00:05:18.770 
that Metro user interface the way
they're<00:05:16.290> setting<00:05:16.560> it<00:05:16.680> up<00:05:17.060> but<00:05:18.060> as<00:05:18.240> far<00:05:18.720> as

00:05:18.770 --> 00:05:18.780 
they're setting it up but as far as

00:05:18.780 --> 00:05:20.150 
they're setting it up but as far as
everything<00:05:19.500> else<00:05:19.590> I<00:05:19.740> think<00:05:19.800> it<00:05:19.980> might<00:05:20.130> be

00:05:20.150 --> 00:05:20.160 
everything else I think it might be

00:05:20.160 --> 00:05:22.220 
everything else I think it might be
actually<00:05:20.550> a<00:05:20.790> really<00:05:21.000> cool<00:05:21.150> operating<00:05:21.840> system

00:05:22.220 --> 00:05:22.230 
actually a really cool operating system

00:05:22.230 --> 00:05:24.920 
actually a really cool operating system
but<00:05:22.560> not<00:05:22.860> on<00:05:23.250> my<00:05:23.580> workstation<00:05:23.940> where<00:05:24.660> I<00:05:24.720> need

00:05:24.920 --> 00:05:24.930 
but not on my workstation where I need

00:05:24.930 --> 00:05:26.480 
but not on my workstation where I need
to<00:05:25.050> get<00:05:25.140> a<00:05:25.200> bunch<00:05:25.500> of<00:05:25.620> work<00:05:25.770> done<00:05:25.980> so<00:05:26.160> I<00:05:26.280> would

00:05:26.480 --> 00:05:26.490 
to get a bunch of work done so I would

00:05:26.490 --> 00:05:29.120 
to get a bunch of work done so I would
think<00:05:26.940> I<00:05:27.240> would<00:05:27.600> not<00:05:27.960> recommend<00:05:28.140> this<00:05:28.680> to<00:05:28.740> real

00:05:29.120 --> 00:05:29.130 
think I would not recommend this to real

00:05:29.130 --> 00:05:31.730 
think I would not recommend this to real
power<00:05:29.430> users<00:05:29.940> but<00:05:30.660> if<00:05:30.780> using<00:05:31.080> like<00:05:31.230> this<00:05:31.440> in<00:05:31.620> an

00:05:31.730 --> 00:05:31.740 
power users but if using like this in an

00:05:31.740 --> 00:05:33.620 
power users but if using like this in an
explorer<00:05:32.220> maybe<00:05:32.460> daily<00:05:32.940> and<00:05:33.090> not<00:05:33.240> too<00:05:33.450> many

00:05:33.620 --> 00:05:33.630

00:05:33.630 --> 00:05:35.540 
explorer maybe daily and not too many
other<00:05:33.810> applications<00:05:34.020> than<00:05:34.740> yeah<00:05:34.950> this<00:05:35.310> might

00:05:35.540 --> 00:05:35.550 
other applications than yeah this might
