 deer and killing him then he gives us the meat 

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:46.170
 of deer that the truth is that it is 

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:48.960
 well is not the deer face gives us the 

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:51.090
 Deer skin and gives us a good horn 

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:52.739
 it would be his two horns then the 

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:54.120
 As a family, we have the first deer 

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:56.960
 the truth is that it 's pretty enough 

00:00:54.120 --> 00:01:00.170
 nice is one is one that is in 

00:00:56.960 --> 00:01:02.870
 phase alpha phase may then 

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:05.320
 have some good bugs this is a how 

00:01:02.870 --> 00:01:08.590
 it's called is a board that would be a pig 

00:01:05.320 --> 00:01:13.000
 a pig this 

00:01:08.590 --> 00:01:14.530
 pork pig something like this is a 

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:17.109
 bird that the truth is that they are very 

00:01:14.530 --> 00:01:19.990
 very well is how creatures mode is 

00:01:17.109 --> 00:01:22.149
 quite pretty pretty let's expose 

00:01:19.990 --> 00:01:23.649
 a squirrel truth that all 

00:01:22.149 --> 00:01:25.990
 that they did quite well enough 

00:01:23.649 --> 00:01:28.119
 I already tell you that it is a way that is in 

00:01:25.990 --> 00:01:30.729
 alpha phase but then well is very very 

00:01:28.119 --> 00:01:32.469
 pretty from what I've seen there are also 

00:01:30.729 --> 00:01:33.700
 more armors that I did not show them that 

00:01:32.469 --> 00:01:36.250
 right now they saw me that it is done 

00:01:33.700 --> 00:01:38.319
 well, burning deer skin 

00:01:36.250 --> 00:01:40.750
 good doing it with the deer skin 

00:01:38.319 --> 00:01:42.700
 that the truth is as if it were a 

00:01:40.750 --> 00:01:45.369
 normal armor is not an armor that 

00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:47.229
 have a lot a lot of protection but 

00:01:45.369 --> 00:01:48.909
 it's pretty good 

00:01:47.229 --> 00:01:51.280
 here we have also a rabbit that 

00:01:48.909 --> 00:01:54.110
 it's pretty pretty nice we have 

00:01:51.280 --> 00:01:56.570
 lizards lizards like 

00:01:54.110 --> 00:01:58.370
 this is very beautiful the truth is that 

00:01:56.570 --> 00:02:01.040
 everything is all very nice the giraffe 

00:01:58.370 --> 00:02:03.410
 it's a bit strange it 's lined all 

00:02:01.040 --> 00:02:05.630
 It must be said I say it is very square 

00:02:03.410 --> 00:02:07.610
 but it sounds like this is okay the giraffe 

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:10.190
 we will be able to not have here our 

00:02:07.610 --> 00:02:12.860
 zoo we do not have fish that 

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:14.960
 they survive in the water that good cams of 

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:17.360
 several colors that really is 

00:02:14.960 --> 00:02:19.400
 pretty pretty nice, we're going to 

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:22.880
 keep expanding more more more here to 

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:27.880
 that you see them good I stayed in 

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:27.880
 these good then let's grab 

00:02:35.330 --> 00:02:44.069
 9 and we have no leftovers 

00:02:40.130 --> 00:02:47.190
 99 and well let's see them this 

00:02:44.069 --> 00:02:50.160
 this is a bee this is very funny and 

00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:51.870
 this did not release honey as you can see here 

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:54.180
 let's put them in feed me what 

00:02:51.870 --> 00:02:56.310
 He released honey and honey because if he eats 

00:02:54.180 --> 00:02:57.780
 honey like that is we can not take it good 

00:02:56.310 --> 00:02:59.239
 right now because I'm in creative I do not 

00:02:57.780 --> 00:03:01.980
 brings a honey dam can be taken 

00:02:59.239 --> 00:03:04.250
 a whale here are the last 

00:03:01.980 --> 00:03:06.780
 in the sand is very beautiful 

00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:08.610
 He makes all his hatreds and we can all 

00:03:06.780 --> 00:03:11.340
 put inside the clear whale that yes 

00:03:08.610 --> 00:03:13.260
 we already gave him a good completion but he's 

00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:15.750
 pretty bad are you pretty mind these 

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:16.980
 we are going to find them 

00:03:15.750 --> 00:03:19.750
 along all the roads more good than 

00:03:16.980 --> 00:03:24.150
 another deer that I do not know why he referred 

00:03:19.750 --> 00:03:24.150
 a bear that is a little fat 

00:03:24.160 --> 00:03:29.110
 a weird bear is fine the truth is 

00:03:26.740 --> 00:03:31.300
 Those who gordy the clear are very well 

00:03:29.110 --> 00:03:34.960
 that they are quite pretty 

00:03:31.300 --> 00:03:37.360
 pretty the ones that the modes 

00:03:34.960 --> 00:03:39.569
 they are the new ones that come a camel 

00:03:37.360 --> 00:03:43.590
 camels the truth that they are 

00:03:39.569 --> 00:03:46.469
 snakes that is a butterfly that here 

00:03:43.590 --> 00:03:49.109
 he puts it to me as 2015 that ants 

00:03:46.469 --> 00:03:51.209
 Sure that we can kill it 

00:03:49.109 --> 00:03:53.150
 well those animals at the moment do not know 

00:03:51.209 --> 00:03:55.920
 they can tame 

00:03:53.150 --> 00:03:58.739
 still can not be tamed they are 

00:03:55.920 --> 00:04:00.540
 animals that, well, this is not no 

00:03:58.739 --> 00:04:02.040
 they are domestic you see everything to all the meat 

00:04:00.540 --> 00:04:04.620
 absolutely all the meat that results 

00:04:02.040 --> 00:04:07.950
 in these animals is bleu cuisine and this 

00:04:04.620 --> 00:04:09.540
 is edible so to speak, this one is 

00:04:07.950 --> 00:04:12.440
 very very well and well then let's continue 

00:04:09.540 --> 00:04:15.780
 seeing what else is not of this thing not 

00:04:12.440 --> 00:04:18.310
 in these then we are not going to grab the 

00:04:15.780 --> 00:04:21.880
 Elephant had already grabbed him 

00:04:18.310 --> 00:04:24.639
 Turtle good until 1 

00:04:21.880 --> 00:04:27.460
 and then 

00:04:24.639 --> 00:04:32.069
 has enough many many many 

00:04:27.460 --> 00:04:32.069
 good are at 23 and 34 

00:04:32.300 --> 00:04:36.870
 8 

00:04:34.740 --> 00:04:39.120
 excellent good let's see this one 

00:04:36.870 --> 00:04:42.229
 turtle hervÃ¡s are very nice the 

00:04:39.120 --> 00:04:42.229
 to see, let's see them 

00:04:44.110 --> 00:04:49.550
 frogs frogs clear yes we have more 

00:04:47.090 --> 00:04:53.270
 we have firefly that would be the 

00:04:49.550 --> 00:04:55.099
 fireflies people and we have birds 

00:04:53.270 --> 00:04:57.770
 good more birds more flies that are 

00:04:55.099 --> 00:05:00.440
 flies no more frog forgiveness but you're 

00:04:57.770 --> 00:05:03.060
 They are frogs, just like we are like to plant 

00:05:00.440 --> 00:05:05.730
 not the others are like toads 

00:05:03.060 --> 00:05:07.830
 mexico are like frogs this are frogs 

00:05:05.730 --> 00:05:09.419
 poisonous as you can see good gave me 

00:05:07.830 --> 00:05:12.150
 poison these islands and we touch them 

00:05:09.419 --> 00:05:14.070
 they even give us poison is very very 

00:05:12.150 --> 00:05:16.380
 well the world brings us lions that are 

00:05:14.070 --> 00:05:18.450
 for being a little ugly everything has to be 

00:05:16.380 --> 00:05:20.460
 say no but because the truth is that 

00:05:18.450 --> 00:05:22.440
 to make them this one tired the gea and 

00:05:20.460 --> 00:05:24.750
 between the grass that appears in the 

00:05:22.440 --> 00:05:26.850
 marshes the truth is that it is quite 

00:05:24.750 --> 00:05:28.200
 pretty well a hole that is like a 

00:05:26.850 --> 00:05:29.790
 lizard so that not those who do not 

00:05:28.200 --> 00:05:32.810
 know what it causes are like 

00:05:29.790 --> 00:05:37.190
 lizards mainly 

00:05:32.810 --> 00:05:38.690
 not mainly I think that I already believe 

00:05:37.190 --> 00:05:40.820
 that is good for everyone, we are going to 

00:05:38.690 --> 00:05:43.160
 grab an elephant to be seen 

00:05:40.820 --> 00:05:44.990
 analyze it none 

00:05:43.160 --> 00:05:47.540
 ko 

00:05:44.990 --> 00:05:48.139
 if they are all that come the truth is 

00:05:47.540 --> 00:05:50.260
 I was 

00:05:48.139 --> 00:05:53.470
 pretty pretty good 

00:05:50.260 --> 00:05:55.750
 this I tell you that it is in alpha phase 

00:05:53.470 --> 00:05:59.500
 but then it would be good to see how it is 

00:05:55.750 --> 00:06:03.100
 that they take it out in the future and good 

00:05:59.500 --> 00:06:05.140
 the animals are ugly I say then no 

00:06:03.100 --> 00:06:07.870
 I know if the best in the future but of 

00:06:05.140 --> 00:06:09.760
 They are ugly and as I already told you 

00:06:07.870 --> 00:06:11.280
 they are very difficult to kill good 

00:06:09.760 --> 00:06:13.950
 big ones are hard to kill 

00:06:11.280 --> 00:06:16.350
 and good also brings us as they already 

00:06:13.950 --> 00:06:18.990
 I say these are not the horns all this 

00:06:16.350 --> 00:06:22.500
 that comes to us because cooked that they are 

00:06:18.990 --> 00:06:23.849
 the frog legs everything the meals 

00:06:22.500 --> 00:06:26.419
 that bring us 

00:06:23.849 --> 00:06:29.639
 this this is done and I told them how 

00:06:26.419 --> 00:06:31.770
 this is this sword that is made with three 

00:06:29.639 --> 00:06:33.780
 horns would be the character would be something 

00:06:31.770 --> 00:06:38.370
 A) Yes 

00:06:33.780 --> 00:06:41.090
 2 and a stick where the sticks are 

00:06:38.370 --> 00:06:41.090
 the stick 

00:06:45.129 --> 00:06:49.360
 is a stick with a character table 

00:06:47.709 --> 00:06:51.900
 story they know how it is done as a 

00:06:49.360 --> 00:06:53.220
 normal state the truth 

00:06:51.900 --> 00:06:54.930
 the truth is that it's pretty enough 

00:06:53.220 --> 00:06:57.300
 well I really like the way that 

00:06:54.930 --> 00:06:59.280
 submit some series yes that is true 

00:06:57.300 --> 00:07:02.460
 because the musketeers is a very mode 

00:06:59.280 --> 00:07:03.900
 heavy and I would like very much but it is 

00:07:02.460 --> 00:07:05.520
 all very well I will not remove the 

00:07:03.900 --> 00:07:10.230
 creative to see that to see that 

00:07:05.520 --> 00:07:12.770
 this attacks so they are hostile too 

00:07:10.230 --> 00:07:12.770
 mode 

00:07:13.750 --> 00:07:22.300
 but that always good assuming the 

00:07:19.190 --> 00:07:22.300
 lion is getting closer 

00:07:22.580 --> 00:07:27.570
 if we attack him, he is surely going to 

00:07:24.810 --> 00:07:29.220
 touching us there attacks us and if that 

00:07:27.570 --> 00:07:32.820
 are three hard not just to kill the 

00:07:29.220 --> 00:07:34.590
 Gorillas also attack you, this one is 

00:07:32.820 --> 00:07:36.480
 ok I liked the way I liked it 

00:07:34.590 --> 00:07:38.760
 a lot I'm going to possibly I'm going to 

00:07:36.480 --> 00:07:41.030
 put in a series the corpses from there 

00:07:38.760 --> 00:07:44.610
 of the school here already plays the alania 

00:07:41.030 --> 00:07:46.350
 poison hit us and they kill us 

00:07:44.610 --> 00:07:47.460
 crocodiles as I tell you are are this 

00:07:46.350 --> 00:07:49.410
 They are civilians truth is 

00:07:47.460 --> 00:07:50.760
 quite pretty good mod 

00:07:49.410 --> 00:07:52.870
 I 'm telling you what I 'm going to put in a series 

00:07:50.760 --> 00:07:56.260
 that is sure 

00:07:52.870 --> 00:07:58.870
 if you liked the way this 

00:07:56.260 --> 00:08:01.450
 I would appreciate it if you vote on the video this 

00:07:58.870 --> 00:08:04.090

00:08:01.450 --> 00:08:06.010

00:08:04.090 --> 00:08:08.050
