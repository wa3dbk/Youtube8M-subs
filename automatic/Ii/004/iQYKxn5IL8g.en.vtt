00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:18.960

 are here watching us today 

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:22.890
 I want to be an example for my children 

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:24.810
 I want them to learn from my 

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:25.980
 and even with my possible 

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:28.290
 mistakes 

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:30.750
 when I look at my children and all 

00:00:28.290 --> 00:00:32.460
 this new generation thinks about letting 

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:35.219
 they a better world 

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:37.559
 today started the election schedule one 

00:00:35.219 --> 00:00:40.649
 where we are going to discuss proposals for 

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:43.199
 improve the lives of the present generation and 

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:43.920
 future generations of our children and 

00:00:43.199 --> 00:00:46.050
 grandchildren 

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:47.280
 I want to build with you a new way 

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:49.559
 to do politics 

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:52.999
 just as with you 

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:52.999
 let's change the 

00:01:05.110 --> 00:01:13.990
 now a different program that 

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:13.990
 will change the paramount governor 15 

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:20.420
 no one has the absolute truth when 

00:01:18.290 --> 00:01:22.310
 you deal with the interest of the 

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:25.250
 collectivity you have to have the 

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:28.340
 humility to listen to people 

00:01:25.250 --> 00:01:32.000
 You can not when you get to a position. 

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:35.080
 public to believe that the power that allows 

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:35.080
 be inaccessible 

00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:42.200
 restless since childhood is what I wanted 

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:43.910
 to be part of the destiny of the 

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:46.340
 very deceived 

00:01:43.910 --> 00:01:48.590
 I remember I was three years old myself 

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:49.610
 I went up on the stage to pick up the microphone and 

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:51.560
 wanted to talk 

00:01:49.610 --> 00:01:53.960
 Helder studied in public school 

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:56.119
 learning to value education as 

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:59.319
 way to turn people into a 

00:01:56.119 --> 00:02:02.810
 thing that marked me a lot and thank you 

00:01:59.319 --> 00:02:04.940
 Thank you very much to my parents, God. 

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:07.789
 when they put me to study 

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:09.950
 In a federal public school lieutenant governor 

00:02:07.789 --> 00:02:11.660
 pimples in Bethlehem at military school 

00:02:09.950 --> 00:02:14.510
 at the same time that I was the son of 

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:17.720
 governor my best friends 

00:02:14.510 --> 00:02:22.910
 was a son of soldier son of corporal 

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:26.330
 son of the sergeant, it showed that 

00:02:22.910 --> 00:02:28.489
 No way you can make distinction 

00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:30.500
 of people by social class 

00:02:28.489 --> 00:02:34.400
 You can make a distinction of people. 

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:37.580
 for whatever reason he would never belittle 

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:39.349
 no one is always well and 

00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:43.670
 this was a differential that I liked 

00:02:39.349 --> 00:02:45.920
 very close a companion will be so 

00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:48.410
 two good hours and in bad hours have a 

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:51.860
 fantastic sense of humor has taken away 

00:02:48.410 --> 00:02:53.340
 awesome so its very good so close to the 

00:02:51.860 --> 00:02:56.459
 elber 

00:02:53.340 --> 00:02:58.530
 and soon came the interest in politics the 

00:02:56.459 --> 00:02:59.459
 time was all political politics 

00:02:58.530 --> 00:03:02.010
 politics 

00:02:59.459 --> 00:03:05.700
 I think he talked. 

00:03:02.010 --> 00:03:08.700
 think of wanting to change things for a 

00:03:05.700 --> 00:03:11.549
 personal choice and councilor of the 

00:03:08.700 --> 00:03:12.360

00:03:22.379 --> 00:03:26.700
 What caught my attention the most is 

00:03:24.660 --> 00:03:29.400
 permanent willingness to change 

00:03:26.700 --> 00:03:31.470
 work so that we could have a 

00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:33.480

00:03:33.480 --> 00:03:39.180

00:04:08.310 --> 00:04:13.349
 that she could be part of this story 

00:04:10.859 --> 00:04:16.560
 at the beginning of our relationship where people 

00:04:13.349 --> 00:04:20.729
