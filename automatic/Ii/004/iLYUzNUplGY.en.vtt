00:00:00.290 --> 00:00:04.160 

okay<00:00:01.290> so<00:00:01.350> here's<00:00:01.800> our<00:00:02.129> final<00:00:03.170> loose

00:00:04.160 --> 00:00:04.170 
okay so here's our final loose

00:00:04.170 --> 00:00:07.730 
okay so here's our final loose
connective<00:00:04.620> tissue<00:00:05.390> again<00:00:06.390> you<00:00:06.899> can<00:00:07.170> see<00:00:07.470> some

00:00:07.730 --> 00:00:07.740 
connective tissue again you can see some

00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:11.020 
connective tissue again you can see some
fibers<00:00:08.340> but<00:00:08.870> there's<00:00:09.870> definitely<00:00:10.349> a<00:00:10.380> lot<00:00:10.650> of

00:00:11.020 --> 00:00:11.030 
fibers but there's definitely a lot of

00:00:11.030 --> 00:00:13.610 
fibers but there's definitely a lot of
material<00:00:12.030> other<00:00:12.240> than<00:00:12.509> fibers<00:00:13.019> taking<00:00:13.500> up

00:00:13.610 --> 00:00:13.620 
material other than fibers taking up

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:16.340 
material other than fibers taking up
this<00:00:13.799> screen<00:00:14.099> and<00:00:14.549> this<00:00:15.000> particular<00:00:15.870> loose

00:00:16.340 --> 00:00:16.350 
this screen and this particular loose

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:18.260 
this screen and this particular loose
connective<00:00:16.800> tissue<00:00:17.190> is<00:00:17.520> reticular

00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:18.270 
connective tissue is reticular

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:20.960 
connective tissue is reticular
connective<00:00:18.510> tissue<00:00:19.470> okay<00:00:20.279> so<00:00:20.340> the<00:00:20.760> dark

00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:20.970 
connective tissue okay so the dark

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:24.439 
connective tissue okay so the dark
fibers<00:00:21.600> that<00:00:21.779> you<00:00:21.869> see<00:00:22.109> here<00:00:22.529> are<00:00:23.449> reticular

00:00:24.439 --> 00:00:24.449 
fibers that you see here are reticular

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:28.700 
fibers that you see here are reticular
fibers<00:00:24.750> and<00:00:26.840> usually<00:00:27.840> those<00:00:28.050> fibers<00:00:28.680> are

00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:28.710 
fibers and usually those fibers are

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:31.580 
fibers and usually those fibers are
highly<00:00:29.580> branched<00:00:29.880> but<00:00:30.810> the<00:00:30.900> branches<00:00:31.439> are

00:00:31.580 --> 00:00:31.590 
highly branched but the branches are

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:33.770 
highly branched but the branches are
kind<00:00:31.830> of<00:00:31.890> small<00:00:32.219> so<00:00:32.730> it's<00:00:32.910> hard<00:00:33.149> to<00:00:33.239> see<00:00:33.540> them

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:33.780 
kind of small so it's hard to see them

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:36.139 
kind of small so it's hard to see them
if<00:00:34.200> you<00:00:34.320> look<00:00:34.500> kind<00:00:34.800> of<00:00:34.890> in<00:00:34.980> the<00:00:35.070> background<00:00:35.760> of

00:00:36.139 --> 00:00:36.149 
if you look kind of in the background of

00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:39.290 
if you look kind of in the background of
the<00:00:37.079> specimen<00:00:37.680> you<00:00:37.800> can<00:00:37.980> see<00:00:38.250> in<00:00:38.489> places<00:00:38.820> where

00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:39.300 
the specimen you can see in places where

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:42.139 
the specimen you can see in places where
there<00:00:39.600> are<00:00:39.629> branch<00:00:40.230> fibers<00:00:40.920> right<00:00:41.579> in<00:00:41.790> here

00:00:42.139 --> 00:00:42.149 
there are branch fibers right in here

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:45.770 
there are branch fibers right in here
you<00:00:42.300> can<00:00:42.480> see<00:00:42.510> some<00:00:42.989> branches<00:00:44.270> in<00:00:45.270> between

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:45.780 
you can see some branches in between

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:48.740 
you can see some branches in between
those<00:00:46.050> little<00:00:46.350> cells<00:00:46.620> and<00:00:47.390> there's<00:00:48.390> a<00:00:48.450> couple

00:00:48.740 --> 00:00:48.750 
those little cells and there's a couple

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:52.040 
those little cells and there's a couple
visible<00:00:49.350> up<00:00:49.530> in<00:00:49.680> here<00:00:50.010> as<00:00:50.129> well<00:00:50.719> so<00:00:51.719> the

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:52.050 
visible up in here as well so the

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:55.130 
visible up in here as well so the
reticular<00:00:52.559> fibers<00:00:52.829> are<00:00:53.690> composed<00:00:54.690> of<00:00:55.020> a

00:00:55.130 --> 00:00:55.140 
reticular fibers are composed of a

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:57.799 
reticular fibers are composed of a
similar<00:00:55.590> material<00:00:55.770> to<00:00:56.520> what<00:00:56.820> collagen<00:00:57.329> fibers

00:00:57.799 --> 00:00:57.809 
similar material to what collagen fibers

00:00:57.809 --> 00:01:01.670 
similar material to what collagen fibers
are<00:00:58.050> composed<00:00:58.980> of<00:00:59.340> but<00:01:00.149> the<00:01:00.840> reticular<00:01:01.410> fibers

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:01.680 
are composed of but the reticular fibers

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:04.280 
are composed of but the reticular fibers
as<00:01:02.100> I<00:01:02.250> said<00:01:02.430> instead<00:01:02.640> of<00:01:02.820> being<00:01:03.059> long<00:01:03.870> and

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:04.290 
as I said instead of being long and

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:06.230 
as I said instead of being long and
straight<00:01:04.650> and<00:01:04.920> thick<00:01:05.309> like<00:01:05.519> the<00:01:05.760> collagen

00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:06.240 
straight and thick like the collagen

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:08.179 
straight and thick like the collagen
fibers<00:01:06.270> they<00:01:06.990> tend<00:01:07.260> the<00:01:07.530> reticular<00:01:07.979> fibers

00:01:08.179 --> 00:01:08.189 
fibers they tend the reticular fibers

00:01:08.189 --> 00:01:11.359 
fibers they tend the reticular fibers
tend<00:01:08.549> to<00:01:08.700> be<00:01:08.790> thin<00:01:09.150> and<00:01:09.590> branched<00:01:10.590> so<00:01:10.860> you<00:01:10.950> find

00:01:11.359 --> 00:01:11.369 
tend to be thin and branched so you find

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:13.760 
tend to be thin and branched so you find
them<00:01:11.580> in<00:01:11.790> places<00:01:12.060> where<00:01:12.390> you<00:01:12.540> need<00:01:12.780> a<00:01:13.049> more

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:13.770 
them in places where you need a more

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:16.940 
them in places where you need a more
gentle<00:01:14.340> type<00:01:14.610> of<00:01:14.850> support<00:01:15.420> and<00:01:15.740> places<00:01:16.740> for

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:16.950 
gentle type of support and places for

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:19.640 
gentle type of support and places for
cells<00:01:17.250> to<00:01:17.610> attach<00:01:17.939> and<00:01:18.450> you<00:01:19.020> can<00:01:19.170> see<00:01:19.320> we<00:01:19.530> have

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:19.650 
cells to attach and you can see we have

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:21.920 
cells to attach and you can see we have
a<00:01:19.680> lot<00:01:19.920> of<00:01:19.950> cells<00:01:20.280> here<00:01:20.820> that<00:01:21.000> need<00:01:21.180> places<00:01:21.570> to

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:21.930 
a lot of cells here that need places to

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:23.469 
a lot of cells here that need places to
attach<00:01:22.290> okay<00:01:23.040> so

00:01:23.469 --> 00:01:23.479 
attach okay so

00:01:23.479 --> 00:01:26.179 
attach okay so

and a place to attach to so as fluid is
going<00:02:10.860> by<00:02:11.039> they<00:02:11.430> can<00:02:11.490> investigate<00:02:12.210> what's<00:02:12.600> in

00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:12.780 
going by they can investigate what's in

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:15.710 
going by they can investigate what's in
there<00:02:13.020> and<00:02:13.490> activate<00:02:14.490> the<00:02:14.730> immune<00:02:14.970> system<00:02:15.480> as

00:02:15.710 --> 00:02:15.720 
there and activate the immune system as

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:18.830 
there and activate the immune system as
appropriate<00:02:16.470> ok<00:02:17.130> so<00:02:17.190> again<00:02:17.520> this<00:02:18.390> is<00:02:18.630> our

00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:18.840 
appropriate ok so again this is our

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:22.010 
appropriate ok so again this is our
third<00:02:19.380> loose<00:02:20.250> connective<00:02:20.700> tissue<00:02:21.150> this<00:02:21.780> is

00:02:22.010 --> 00:02:22.020 
third loose connective tissue this is

00:02:22.020 --> 00:02:24.650 
third loose connective tissue this is
the<00:02:22.170> most<00:02:22.410> cellular<00:02:23.280> of<00:02:23.520> all<00:02:24.209> of<00:02:24.510> the

00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:24.660 
the most cellular of all of the

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:27.770 
the most cellular of all of the
connective<00:02:25.170> tissues<00:02:25.650> and<00:02:25.950> this<00:02:26.580> is<00:02:26.910> reticular

00:02:27.770 --> 00:02:27.780 
connective tissues and this is reticular

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:31.070 
connective tissues and this is reticular
connective<00:02:28.080> tissue
