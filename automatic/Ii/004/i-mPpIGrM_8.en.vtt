00:00:12.620 --> 00:00:17.279
 hi to all youtubers as you will have 

00:00:15.269 --> 00:00:20.220
 could see from the title of this video 

00:00:17.279 --> 00:00:23.070
 today I will tell you that between 22 and 28 

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:25.560
 September 2015 an asteroid a 

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:27.300
 to destroy the earth the NASA answers 

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:29.460
 so as usual we go to 

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:31.590
 analyze better what it is 

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:32.880
 the earth will be destroyed by an asteroid 

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:34.969
 in the month of September 

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:37.559
 the impact will cause very heavy rains 

00:00:34.969 --> 00:00:38.250
 torrential and humanity will be destined to 

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:40.410
 to disappear 

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:42.600
 this is what was announced by the group of 

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:44.879
 Conspiracy theorists who gave 

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:47.309
 also a date of the event that should 

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:49.950
 occur between the 22nd and 28th of the month 

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:52.050
 the theory emerges following some 

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:54.030
 bible studies that talk about 

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:56.280
 come of hell on earth 

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:58.620
 nasa, however, reassured everyone how 

00:00:56.280 --> 00:01:00.510
 meter shows there are no asteroids or 

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:02.280
 comet currently en route with the earth 

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:04.890
 the probability of a big fight is 

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:06.360
 very low then fired specify 

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:07.560
 that small objects come into 

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:09.689
 collision with the planet in 

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:11.460
 continuation but part of atmosphere 

00:01:09.689 --> 00:01:13.979
 disturbing during their journey 

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:15.570
 so for this you are completely there in the past 

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:17.640
 It was golden I hope this year it is 

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:19.650
 listen interesting and at the same time 

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:21.119
 to have made to understand that it is not necessary 

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:23.220
 never take it seriously 

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:25.650
 everything we read about 

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:27.600
 different sites that we find and that we can 

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:29.790
 find on the internet because most 

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:31.979
 part of the time the news comes a bit 

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:33.750
 turned and consequently unleashed the 

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:36.570
 panic when there is no need 

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:38.270
 NASA naturally I don't know how you put that 

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:40.070
 should really fall 

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:42.020
 also on the earth that we could say 

00:01:40.070 --> 00:01:44.420
 maybe wipe away NASA 

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:47.060
 would announce to the whole world however in the 

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:49.310
 meanwhile also for the future there 

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:51.740
 they are asteroids that we can say 

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:53.780
 to wipe us from the planet is obvious how 

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:55.509
 said this article that small 

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:57.860
 celestial objects collided 

00:01:55.509 --> 00:01:59.869
 continuously with our planet but 

00:01:57.860 --> 00:02:02.179
 they are destroyed by the atmosphere e 

00:01:59.869 --> 00:02:03.799
 then his reaches it therefore for 

00:02:02.179 --> 00:02:05.539
 this video I hope you do 

00:02:03.799 --> 00:02:08.049
 normally then served if you want 

00:02:05.539 --> 00:02:08.049
