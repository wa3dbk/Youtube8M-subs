actually a nice puzzle the rubik's
revolution<00:00:21.930> was<00:00:22.350> another<00:00:23.000> electronic<00:00:24.000> puzzle

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:24.510 
revolution was another electronic puzzle

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:28.490 
revolution was another electronic puzzle
and<00:00:24.810> that<00:00:25.439> didn't<00:00:26.160> wasn't<00:00:26.640> very<00:00:27.240> a<00:00:27.599> good

00:00:28.490 --> 00:00:28.500 
and that didn't wasn't very a good

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:31.930 
and that didn't wasn't very a good
puzzle<00:00:28.769> there's<00:00:29.160> a<00:00:29.220> working<00:00:29.760> puzzle<00:00:30.150> but<00:00:30.560> it

00:00:31.930 --> 00:00:31.940 
puzzle there's a working puzzle but it

00:00:31.940 --> 00:00:35.830 
puzzle there's a working puzzle but it
wasn't<00:00:32.940> very<00:00:33.210> cool<00:00:33.899> like<00:00:34.430> nobody<00:00:35.430> really

00:00:35.830 --> 00:00:35.840 
wasn't very cool like nobody really

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:43.190 
wasn't very cool like nobody really
likes<00:00:36.840> it<00:00:37.110> a<00:00:37.200> lot<00:00:37.380> and<00:00:38.450> so<00:00:40.250> but<00:00:41.250> this<00:00:41.460> is<00:00:41.820> a<00:00:42.480> good

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:43.200 
likes it a lot and so but this is a good

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:48.020 
likes it a lot and so but this is a good
puzzle<00:00:43.440> it<00:00:43.969> it<00:00:44.969> can<00:00:45.180> be<00:00:45.300> done<00:00:45.510> by<00:00:46.309> people<00:00:47.309> who

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:48.030 
puzzle it it can be done by people who

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:49.850 
puzzle it it can be done by people who
don't<00:00:48.360> even<00:00:48.510> know<00:00:48.840> how<00:00:49.020> to<00:00:49.050> solve<00:00:49.410> the<00:00:49.620> cube

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:49.860 
don't even know how to solve the cube

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:55.520 
don't even know how to solve the cube
but<00:00:50.340> still<00:00:51.120> give<00:00:51.480> you<00:00:51.809> a<00:00:51.840> brain<00:00:52.320> challenge<00:00:54.530> so

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:55.530 
but still give you a brain challenge so

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:58.939 
but still give you a brain challenge so
how<00:00:56.250> this<00:00:56.399> works<00:00:56.460> is<00:00:57.149> a<00:00:57.360> sliding<00:00:58.020> top<00:00:58.440> it's

00:00:58.939 --> 00:00:58.949 
how this works is a sliding top it's

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:03.830 
how this works is a sliding top it's
only<00:00:59.190> one<00:00:59.489> sided<00:00:59.820> and<00:01:00.920> it<00:01:01.920> slides<00:01:02.809> to<00:01:03.809> the

00:01:03.830 --> 00:01:03.840 
only one sided and it slides to the

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:07.460 
only one sided and it slides to the
sides<00:01:04.199> only<00:01:04.949> a<00:01:04.979> certain<00:01:05.549> degree<00:01:05.760> and<00:01:06.470> it

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:07.470 
sides only a certain degree and it

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:13.510 
sides only a certain degree and it
slides<00:01:07.920> up<00:01:08.790> down<00:01:09.750> left<00:01:10.229> and<00:01:10.500> right

00:01:13.510 --> 00:01:13.520 

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:18.140 

diagonally<00:01:14.520> both<00:01:14.729> ways<00:01:15.320> so<00:01:16.610> the<00:01:17.610> top<00:01:17.850> moves

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:18.150 
diagonally both ways so the top moves

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:20.390 
diagonally both ways so the top moves
and<00:01:18.509> it<00:01:18.689> moves<00:01:18.720> quite<00:01:19.290> well<00:01:19.530> you<00:01:19.920> don't<00:01:20.100> have

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:20.400 
and it moves quite well you don't have

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:24.649 
and it moves quite well you don't have
problems<00:01:21.030> while<00:01:21.360> solving<00:01:21.960> it<00:01:22.729> so<00:01:23.729> so<00:01:24.299> let<00:01:24.509> me

00:01:24.649 --> 00:01:24.659 
problems while solving it so so let me

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:28.880 
problems while solving it so so let me
go<00:01:24.840> in<00:01:25.020> to<00:01:25.650> more<00:01:25.979> about<00:01:26.400> this<00:01:26.909> puzzle<00:01:27.650> I'll<00:01:28.650> go

00:02:27.310 --> 00:02:27.320 
you have to go from here to here and you

00:02:27.320 --> 00:02:31.320 
you have to go from here to here and you
can<00:02:27.500> just<00:02:27.770> push<00:02:28.760> it<00:02:28.790> over<00:02:29.210> and<00:02:29.420> I'll<00:02:29.840> be<00:02:29.990> right

00:02:31.320 --> 00:02:31.330 
can just push it over and I'll be right

00:02:31.330 --> 00:02:34.720 
can just push it over and I'll be right
here's<00:02:32.330> another<00:02:32.690> very<00:02:33.080> simple<00:02:33.470> one<00:02:33.770> there's

00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:34.730 
here's another very simple one there's

00:02:34.730 --> 00:02:38.080 
here's another very simple one there's
this<00:02:34.910> one<00:02:35.290> it<00:02:36.290> has<00:02:36.440> to<00:02:36.590> go<00:02:36.740> here<00:02:37.010> so<00:02:37.640> this<00:02:37.880> will

00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:38.090 
this one it has to go here so this will

00:02:38.090 --> 00:02:41.830 
this one it has to go here so this will
require<00:02:38.480> two<00:02:38.900> moves<00:02:39.670> so<00:02:40.670> just<00:02:41.360> show<00:02:41.540> you<00:02:41.600> how

00:02:41.830 --> 00:02:41.840 
require two moves so just show you how

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:44.530 
require two moves so just show you how
this<00:02:41.990> thing<00:02:42.260> moves<00:02:42.530> you<00:02:43.280> can<00:02:43.459> always<00:02:43.610> push<00:02:44.390> it

00:02:44.530 --> 00:02:44.540 
this thing moves you can always push it

00:02:44.540 --> 00:02:51.130 
this thing moves you can always push it
around<00:02:45.459> up<00:02:47.650> around<00:02:48.650> and<00:02:49.070> then<00:02:49.720> from<00:02:50.720> corner<00:02:51.110> to

00:02:51.130 --> 00:02:51.140 
around up around and then from corner to

00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:57.370 
around up around and then from corner to
corner<00:02:51.580> or<00:02:52.840> edge<00:02:53.840> to<00:02:54.500> edge<00:02:56.020> now<00:02:57.020> it's<00:02:57.170> in<00:02:57.290> the

00:02:57.370 --> 00:02:57.380 
corner or edge to edge now it's in the

00:02:57.380 --> 00:03:01.990 
corner or edge to edge now it's in the
right<00:02:57.470> place<00:02:59.830> and<00:03:00.830> there<00:03:01.220> you<00:03:01.280> go<00:03:01.430> you<00:03:01.490> have<00:03:01.700> to

00:03:01.990 --> 00:03:02.000 
right place and there you go you have to

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:06.840 
right place and there you go you have to
turn<00:03:02.660> it<00:03:02.890> put<00:03:03.890> it<00:03:04.010> in<00:03:04.130> the<00:03:04.280> right<00:03:04.400> place<00:03:04.670> so

00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:06.850 
turn it put it in the right place so

00:03:06.850 --> 00:03:09.640 
turn it put it in the right place so
this<00:03:07.850> is<00:03:08.060> the<00:03:08.180> easy<00:03:08.390> level<00:03:08.690> which<00:03:09.200> the<00:03:09.440> easy

00:03:09.640 --> 00:03:09.650 
this is the easy level which the easy

00:03:09.650 --> 00:03:12.400 
this is the easy level which the easy
level<00:03:09.920> isn't<00:03:10.310> as<00:03:10.670> easy<00:03:11.000> as<00:03:11.120> it<00:03:11.420> seems<00:03:12.050> right

00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:12.410 
level isn't as easy as it seems right

00:03:12.410 --> 00:03:16.630 
level isn't as easy as it seems right
now<00:03:14.230> is<00:03:15.230> there<00:03:15.560> some<00:03:15.769> of<00:03:15.860> the<00:03:15.920> easiest<00:03:16.310> ones

00:03:16.630 --> 00:03:16.640 
now is there some of the easiest ones

00:03:16.640 --> 00:03:20.110 
now is there some of the easiest ones
you<00:03:16.880> can<00:03:17.060> get<00:03:17.470> and<00:03:18.550> then<00:03:19.550> you<00:03:19.580> can<00:03:19.880> get<00:03:20.060> to

00:03:20.110 --> 00:03:20.120 
you can get and then you can get to

00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:26.199 
you can get and then you can get to
colors<00:03:23.019> that<00:03:24.019> one<00:03:24.200> was<00:03:24.350> all<00:03:24.530> so<00:03:24.680> simple<00:03:25.150> but<00:03:26.150> so

00:03:26.199 --> 00:03:26.209 
colors that one was all so simple but so

00:03:26.209 --> 00:03:30.390 
colors that one was all so simple but so
this<00:03:26.570> cube<00:03:26.870> offers<00:03:27.500> a<00:03:27.530> challenge<00:03:27.890> if<00:03:28.310> you<00:03:28.430> just

00:03:30.390 --> 00:03:30.400 
this cube offers a challenge if you just

00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:34.240 
this cube offers a challenge if you just
wants<00:03:31.400> an<00:03:31.519> easier<00:03:32.060> challenge<00:03:32.830> you<00:03:33.830> can<00:03:33.950> do<00:03:34.130> the

00:03:34.240 --> 00:03:34.250 
wants an easier challenge you can do the

00:03:34.250 --> 00:03:35.860 
wants an easier challenge you can do the
easy<00:03:34.400> level<00:03:34.700> if<00:03:35.030> you<00:03:35.209> actually<00:03:35.360> want<00:03:35.780> to

00:03:35.860 --> 00:03:35.870 
easy level if you actually want to

00:03:35.870 --> 00:03:38.080 
easy level if you actually want to
really<00:03:36.230> work<00:03:36.560> your<00:03:36.620> brain<00:03:37.130> you<00:03:37.310> can<00:03:37.489> do<00:03:37.640> medium

00:03:38.080 --> 00:03:38.090 
really work your brain you can do medium

00:03:38.090 --> 00:03:42.100 
really work your brain you can do medium
or<00:03:38.330> hard<00:03:38.739> the<00:03:39.739> mediums<00:03:40.190> if<00:03:40.550> you<00:03:41.480> have<00:03:41.720> two

00:03:42.100 --> 00:03:42.110 
or hard the mediums if you have two

00:03:42.110 --> 00:03:45.430 
or hard the mediums if you have two
pieces<00:03:42.350> here<00:03:42.830> and<00:03:43.010> you<00:03:43.250> go<00:03:44.060> like<00:03:44.239> that<00:03:44.440> they'll

00:03:45.430 --> 00:03:45.440 
pieces here and you go like that they'll

00:03:45.440 --> 00:03:47.229 
pieces here and you go like that they'll
shift<00:03:45.799> down<00:03:46.010> here<00:03:46.430> it<00:03:46.580> will<00:03:46.670> just<00:03:46.730> move<00:03:47.030> over

00:03:47.229 --> 00:03:47.239 
shift down here it will just move over

00:03:47.239 --> 00:03:49.330 
shift down here it will just move over
one<00:03:47.600> space<00:03:47.989> instead<00:03:48.530> of<00:03:48.590> going<00:03:48.860> from<00:03:49.040> here

00:03:49.330 --> 00:03:49.340 
one space instead of going from here

00:03:49.340 --> 00:03:53.490 
one space instead of going from here
down<00:03:49.760> to<00:03:49.790> here<00:03:50.769> automatically<00:03:52.030> so<00:03:53.030> it

00:03:53.490 --> 00:03:53.500 
down to here automatically so it

00:03:53.500 --> 00:03:59.670 
down to here automatically so it
involves<00:03:54.500> more<00:03:54.739> moves<00:03:55.010> and<00:03:56.019> more<00:03:57.019> brainpower

00:03:59.670 --> 00:03:59.680 

00:03:59.680 --> 00:04:04.720 

so<00:04:00.680> that<00:04:00.920> is<00:04:01.220> the<00:04:01.670> infinity<00:04:02.330> mode<00:04:02.570> which<00:04:03.730> it

00:04:04.720 --> 00:04:04.730 
so that is the infinity mode which it

00:04:04.730 --> 00:04:07.599 
so that is the infinity mode which it
has<00:04:05.030> right<00:04:05.299> here<00:04:05.510> it<00:04:05.630> says<00:04:05.810> off<00:04:06.160> infinity<00:04:07.160> as<00:04:07.430> a

00:04:07.599 --> 00:04:07.609 
has right here it says off infinity as a

00:04:07.609 --> 00:04:10.539 
has right here it says off infinity as a
little<00:04:07.970> infinity<00:04:08.570> symbol<00:04:08.989> and<00:04:09.250> then<00:04:10.250> it<00:04:10.400> has

00:04:10.539 --> 00:04:10.549 
little infinity symbol and then it has

00:04:10.549 --> 00:04:11.860 
little infinity symbol and then it has
the<00:04:10.760> clock<00:04:11.150> if<00:04:11.420> you<00:04:11.540> go<00:04:11.690> to

00:04:11.860 --> 00:04:11.870 
the clock if you go to

00:04:11.870 --> 00:04:19.030 
the clock if you go to
the<00:04:11.900> clock<00:04:13.659> and<00:04:15.070> it<00:04:16.070> will<00:04:16.220> say<00:04:18.040> lightning

00:04:19.030 --> 00:04:19.040 
the clock and it will say lightning

00:04:19.040 --> 00:04:20.949 
the clock and it will say lightning
round<00:04:19.280> so<00:04:19.910> basically<00:04:20.419> in<00:04:20.630> the<00:04:20.750> lightning

00:04:20.949 --> 00:04:20.959 
round so basically in the lightning

00:04:20.959 --> 00:04:23.800 
round so basically in the lightning
round<00:04:21.380> you<00:04:22.040> get<00:04:22.250> ten<00:04:22.280> puzzles<00:04:22.970> and<00:04:23.240> you<00:04:23.510> solve

00:04:23.800 --> 00:04:23.810 
round you get ten puzzles and you solve

00:04:23.810 --> 00:04:25.150 
round you get ten puzzles and you solve
it<00:04:24.020> as<00:04:24.199> fast<00:04:24.440> as<00:04:24.590> you<00:04:24.680> can

00:04:25.150 --> 00:04:25.160 
it as fast as you can

00:04:25.160 --> 00:04:31.360 
it as fast as you can
so<00:04:25.460> I'll<00:04:25.790> just<00:04:26.210> do<00:04:26.360> it<00:04:26.479> for<00:04:26.660> you<00:04:27.580> first<00:04:28.580> one<00:04:30.370> the

00:04:31.360 --> 00:04:31.370 
so I'll just do it for you first one the

00:04:31.370 --> 00:04:52.420 
so I'll just do it for you first one the
first<00:04:31.400> ones<00:04:31.820> tend<00:04:32.180> to<00:04:32.210> be<00:04:32.300> easy<00:04:51.190> that's<00:04:52.190> what<00:04:52.400> I

00:04:52.420 --> 00:04:52.430 
first ones tend to be easy that's what I

00:04:52.430 --> 00:05:15.680 
first ones tend to be easy that's what I
need<00:04:52.669> to<00:04:52.760> get<00:04:52.880> to

00:05:15.680 --> 00:05:15.690 

00:05:15.690 --> 00:05:18.830 

so<00:05:16.350> I<00:05:16.710> just<00:05:16.980> happen<00:05:17.430> to<00:05:17.640> get<00:05:17.790> really<00:05:18.330> easy<00:05:18.540> one

00:05:18.830 --> 00:05:18.840 
so I just happen to get really easy one

00:05:18.840 --> 00:05:21.640 
so I just happen to get really easy one
so<00:05:19.050> usually<00:05:19.470> there's<00:05:20.250> one<00:05:20.490> hard<00:05:20.760> one<00:05:20.940> and

00:05:21.640 --> 00:05:21.650 
so usually there's one hard one and

00:05:21.650 --> 00:05:24.590 
so usually there's one hard one and
there's<00:05:22.650> the<00:05:22.830> colored<00:05:23.160> pink<00:05:23.490> if<00:05:24.060> you<00:05:24.270> can<00:05:24.450> see

00:05:24.590 --> 00:05:24.600 
there's the colored pink if you can see

00:05:24.600 --> 00:05:36.140 
there's the colored pink if you can see
that<00:05:25.460> the<00:05:26.460> pink<00:05:26.730> is<00:05:26.880> in<00:05:27.030> the<00:05:27.120> middle<00:05:27.420> so<00:05:35.150> here

00:05:36.140 --> 00:05:36.150 
that the pink is in the middle so here

00:05:36.150 --> 00:05:38.020 
that the pink is in the middle so here
you<00:05:36.270> can<00:05:36.450> kind<00:05:36.690> of<00:05:36.780> see<00:05:37.020> the<00:05:37.260> colors<00:05:37.560> more

00:05:38.020 --> 00:05:38.030 
you can kind of see the colors more

00:05:38.030 --> 00:05:43.370 
you can kind of see the colors more
vividly<00:05:40.790> so<00:05:41.790> this<00:05:41.970> offers<00:05:42.570> a<00:05:42.870> unique

00:05:43.370 --> 00:05:43.380 
vividly so this offers a unique

00:05:43.380 --> 00:05:46.430 
vividly so this offers a unique
challenge<00:05:43.650> to<00:05:44.310> people<00:05:44.640> who<00:05:44.960> can't<00:05:45.960> solve<00:05:46.230> the

00:05:46.430 --> 00:05:46.440 
challenge to people who can't solve the

00:05:46.440 --> 00:05:50.150 
challenge to people who can't solve the
queue<00:05:47.330> but<00:05:48.330> it<00:05:48.540> is<00:05:48.720> still<00:05:49.020> a<00:05:49.200> nice<00:05:49.350> puzzle<00:05:49.830> if

00:05:50.150 --> 00:05:50.160 
queue but it is still a nice puzzle if

00:05:50.160 --> 00:05:54.230 
queue but it is still a nice puzzle if
you<00:05:50.580> can<00:05:51.740> there's<00:05:52.740> hard<00:05:53.130> medium<00:05:53.700> easy

00:05:54.230 --> 00:05:54.240 
you can there's hard medium easy

00:05:54.240 --> 00:05:59.480 
you can there's hard medium easy
settings<00:05:55.280> and<00:05:57.380> it<00:05:58.380> takes<00:05:58.710> some<00:05:58.920> practice<00:05:59.070> to

00:05:59.480 --> 00:05:59.490 
settings and it takes some practice to

00:05:59.490 --> 00:06:06.740 
settings and it takes some practice to
master<00:06:00.180> it<00:06:04.640> like<00:06:05.640> sometimes<00:06:06.120> you<00:06:06.480> have<00:06:06.600> to

00:06:06.740 --> 00:06:06.750 
master it like sometimes you have to

00:06:06.750 --> 00:06:11.900 
master it like sometimes you have to
figure<00:06:07.080> out<00:06:07.230> good<00:06:07.620> ways<00:06:07.830> to<00:06:10.580> move<00:06:11.580> certain

00:06:11.900 --> 00:06:11.910 
figure out good ways to move certain

00:06:11.910 --> 00:06:18.020 
figure out good ways to move certain
pieces<00:06:12.270> around<00:06:16.400> so<00:06:17.400> just<00:06:17.640> giving<00:06:17.910> you

00:06:18.020 --> 00:06:18.030 
pieces around so just giving you

00:06:18.030 --> 00:06:27.320 
pieces around so just giving you
examples<00:06:18.060> here<00:06:24.620> this<00:06:25.620> is<00:06:25.800> what<00:06:25.980> I<00:06:26.010> have<00:06:26.330> this

00:06:27.320 --> 00:06:27.330 
examples here this is what I have this

00:06:27.330 --> 00:06:49.020
