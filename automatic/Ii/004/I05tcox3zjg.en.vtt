00:00:12.590 --> 00:00:15.880
 1 

00:00:13.880 --> 00:00:15.880
 and 

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:21.080
 yeah 

00:00:24.160 --> 00:00:27.939
 the tn 

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:31.270
 hello everyone i hope you 

00:00:30.190 --> 00:00:32.680
 go well today I 'll go 

00:00:31.270 --> 00:00:34.330
 present a video that I have never 

00:00:32.680 --> 00:00:35.680
 featured on my youtube channel while 

00:00:34.330 --> 00:00:38.230
 I'll just show you that I have 

00:00:35.680 --> 00:00:39.010
 could get 100% of the trophies on the game 

00:00:38.230 --> 00:00:40.630
 plants against zombies 

00:00:39.010 --> 00:00:42.370
 so for those who would like a little 

00:00:40.630 --> 00:00:43.989
 little see what it looks like as soon as we 

00:00:42.370 --> 00:00:45.220
 unlocks his trophies there so that's 

00:00:43.989 --> 00:00:46.150
 the first time I finish a game 

00:00:45.220 --> 00:00:49.390
 we will say 100% 

00:00:46.150 --> 00:00:52.059
 good for sure xbox that I am and that's 

00:00:49.390 --> 00:00:53.440
 not necessarily complete and that you 

00:00:52.059 --> 00:00:55.180
 explain that I finish them and 

00:00:53.440 --> 00:00:56.500
 subconsciously I did not say good 

00:00:55.180 --> 00:00:58.330
 well I have to play we will say with the 

00:00:56.500 --> 00:01:00.400
 trophy so that's really the big thing 

00:00:58.330 --> 00:01:02.620
 particularity of this video is I am 

00:01:00.400 --> 00:01:03.970
 I'm not more bitter than that except 

00:01:02.620 --> 00:01:05.110
 six trophies you actually see here that 

00:01:03.970 --> 00:01:06.820
 I got very recently 

00:01:05.110 --> 00:01:08.680
 as you could see at the level of the 

00:01:06.820 --> 00:01:10.690
 date so that's the only thing I'm 

00:01:08.680 --> 00:01:13.000
 am a little more committed to doing 

00:01:10.690 --> 00:01:14.259
 so I finished the dingo mode so 

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:15.790
 it's the odyssey the most 

00:01:14.259 --> 00:01:19.450
 difficult at the garden level to ps 

00:01:15.790 --> 00:01:19.810
 after we defused bombs from 

00:01:19.450 --> 00:01:21.790
 bombs 

00:01:19.810 --> 00:01:22.750
 nene etc there are a lot of stuff that are 

00:01:21.790 --> 00:01:24.580
 really cool like that i'll get you 

00:01:22.750 --> 00:01:27.729
 show so we reached levels 50 

00:01:24.580 --> 00:01:29.500
 so I'm 74 between like that so he 

00:01:27.729 --> 00:01:30.610
 are challenges that have made 

00:01:29.500 --> 00:01:33.250
 naturally so I do not want you 

00:01:30.610 --> 00:01:34.060
 lie not that all of that from there 

00:01:33.250 --> 00:01:36.580
 was done naturally 

00:01:34.060 --> 00:01:37.659
 so after, do not hesitate to tell me 

00:01:36.580 --> 00:01:39.280
 really what do you think 

00:01:37.659 --> 00:01:40.810
 relative to you is this 

00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:42.340
 complicated or not at trophy level 

00:01:40.810 --> 00:01:44.380
 me personally when i explain g 

00:01:42.340 --> 00:01:46.090
 that playing I did not focus there 

00:01:44.380 --> 00:01:46.960
 on it but you personally if you 

00:01:46.090 --> 00:01:49.540
 play trophy is what you find 

00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:49.810
 default trophies more difficult than 

00:01:49.540 --> 00:01:51.760
 other 

00:01:49.810 --> 00:01:53.409
 do not hesitate to tell me like that in 

00:01:51.760 --> 00:01:54.970
 same time to discuss it so that's it 

00:01:53.409 --> 00:01:56.470
 it's to show you a little bit 

00:01:54.970 --> 00:01:57.369
 little things that are really cool on 

00:01:56.470 --> 00:02:00.520
 will say afterwards 

00:01:57.369 --> 00:02:02.880
 so here you have been able to see there is 

00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:05.110
 a lot of stuff at the bottom of the teleportation 

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:06.790
 that's more with the little roudoudou 

00:02:05.110 --> 00:02:11.290
 that is to say with the weight we have 

00:02:06.790 --> 00:02:12.459
 blow up all that I'm not really 

00:02:11.290 --> 00:02:13.810
 fan of the trophies but I told myself 

00:02:12.459 --> 00:02:15.010
 why not offer this video 

00:02:13.810 --> 00:02:16.140
 since many have told me but tell you 

00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:18.190
 it would be nice if you present 

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:20.320
 the trophies of plants against zombies 

00:02:18.190 --> 00:02:21.970
 I was just waiting determined 

00:02:20.320 --> 00:02:23.079
 so that you can present them 

00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:25.120
 it's a game where I really spent 

00:02:23.079 --> 00:02:27.070
 a lot of time and people will be 

00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:27.959
 still much in any case what 

00:02:27.070 --> 00:02:30.370
 do look good 

00:02:27.959 --> 00:02:32.410
 so if I go too fast do not hesitate 

00:02:30.370 --> 00:02:36.130
 to but just the pause button 

00:02:32.410 --> 00:02:39.310
 and after you look at what you 

00:02:36.130 --> 00:02:40.430
 interests the trophy that have been more 

00:02:39.310 --> 00:02:42.170
 easy than others 

00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:45.170
 but after as I explained it was 

00:02:42.170 --> 00:02:47.239
 more with lepisto weight had to defeat 

00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:48.530
 enemies and in a party with the 

00:02:47.239 --> 00:02:51.469
 turret so that was just the most 

00:02:48.530 --> 00:02:53.390
 hard after the gadgi the john travolta and 

00:02:51.469 --> 00:02:55.400
 it's still pretty easy we're not going to 

00:02:53.390 --> 00:02:58.400
 lie just play it so 

00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:59.780
 after dint of practicing anyone 

00:02:58.400 --> 00:03:01.599
 can succeed it's not really a game 

00:02:59.780 --> 00:03:03.439
 very complicated it is rather a game of 

00:03:01.599 --> 00:03:05.389
 family where we can do a lot of 

00:03:03.439 --> 00:03:07.219
 really cool things we're going to say redo 

00:03:05.389 --> 00:03:09.500
 as it is not complex apart 

00:03:07.219 --> 00:03:11.090
 to pass the grades that I admit 

00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:12.230
 that it's really a bit crooked it's 

00:03:11.090 --> 00:03:15.439
 that you have to have either the stars or 

00:03:12.230 --> 00:03:17.150
 be completed each challenge category 

00:03:15.439 --> 00:03:19.069
 for example up to 15 

00:03:17.150 --> 00:03:20.299
 and there you will pass a grade there by 

00:03:19.069 --> 00:03:20.629
 against it's super long I do not say the 

00:03:20.299 --> 00:03:22.700
 opposite 

00:03:20.629 --> 00:03:24.379
 so here but after to have everything 

00:03:22.700 --> 00:03:26.569
 simply the opportunity to pass the 

00:03:24.379 --> 00:03:27.709
 most complicated challenges bah you 

00:03:26.569 --> 00:03:29.540
 Take the stars and makes you 

00:03:27.709 --> 00:03:31.159
 pass that so we in any case the 

00:03:29.540 --> 00:03:32.299
 trophies I wanted world quickly 

00:03:31.159 --> 00:03:34.280
 which you could see so do not hesitate 

00:03:32.299 --> 00:03:37.430
 not to say what you think so 

00:03:34.280 --> 00:03:40.069
 100% of the trophy so it really does 

00:03:37.430 --> 00:03:42.680
 pleasure number in any case it is the only 

00:03:40.069 --> 00:03:43.760
 game or subconsciously I managed to 

00:03:42.680 --> 00:03:45.500
 get it 100% 

00:03:43.760 --> 00:03:47.209
 so here are the friends me I tell you to 

00:03:45.500 --> 00:03:48.319
 very soon for other videos and 

00:03:47.209 --> 00:03:51.790
 do not worry plants against 

00:03:48.319 --> 00:03:51.790
 zombies restart very quickly
