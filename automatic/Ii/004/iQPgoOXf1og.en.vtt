00:00:08.999 --> 00:00:11.439
 I want to lose a lot of money 

00:00:11.439 --> 00:00:14.719
 I want a world that collects the bbc 

00:00:14.719 --> 00:00:17.359
 I do not want to be a true 

00:00:17.359 --> 00:00:18.859
 they are not alone 

00:00:18.859 --> 00:00:20.550
 something really 

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:23.550
 LOL 

00:00:26.819 --> 00:00:29.819
 I do not want to cry, remembered that the screen 

00:00:30.899 --> 00:00:33.300
 dt omar de felippe 

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:36.680
 I want to come back 

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:39.680
 my dad told me 'I want 0 

00:00:46.030 --> 00:00:49.030
 in silver and his friends 

00:00:51.730 --> 00:00:54.730
 with 12 Apr 

00:00:57.720 --> 00:01:01.090
 you're doing cantinflas trying to find a remedy 

00:01:01.860 --> 00:01:02.700
 the colds 

00:01:02.700 --> 00:01:05.880
 because I've already tired of coughing and fraser 

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:08.880
 For a long time you have been looking for the remedy 

00:01:10.410 --> 00:01:12.340
 yes but nobody has the status 

00:01:12.340 --> 00:01:15.340
 secret ingredient 

00:01:17.940 --> 00:01:20.800
 cissÃ© ties created to his death 

00:01:20.800 --> 00:01:24.500
 two and a half men for the cold but a good way to breathe 

00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:25.230
 he pointed 

00:01:25.230 --> 00:01:28.410
 I'll be me I think I did not grow critical patient 

00:01:28.410 --> 00:01:33.550
 I'm going to give up and what is evident is not a good attitude and 

00:01:33.550 --> 00:01:34.380
 why not 

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:38.860
 a famous person said we should believe that we have the ability to do something 

00:01:38.860 --> 00:01:41.860
 and that if something should be achieved at all costs 

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:46.039
 It must have been a very wise man who said that 

00:01:46.039 --> 00:01:47.680
 I would like to know him 

00:01:47.680 --> 00:01:50.810
 cantinflas birds was not a man without a woman 

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:52.370
 cuartango said 

00:01:52.370 --> 00:01:56.470
 a famous scientist had very strong convictions about the 

00:01:56.470 --> 00:01:59.470
 perseverance and sudden clinical demonstrate 

00:01:59.470 --> 00:02:02.020
 betancor and I am cantinflas 

00:02:02.020 --> 00:02:04.240
 I would like to know everything about his life 

00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:06.500
 I spent most of my life here 

00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:09.840
 in this laboratory always scientific locations 

00:02:10.649 --> 00:02:14.739
 but even as a child in Poland where I was born in May a month half of her 

00:02:14.739 --> 00:02:16.039
 student news 

00:02:16.039 --> 00:02:20.799
 my father was a high school teacher and I did not even love watching the samples of 

00:02:20.799 --> 00:02:24.179
 minerals that he had and his fascinating cystic instruments 

00:02:25.739 --> 00:02:30.029
 that yes are very difficult things not jersey but I graduated from high school 

00:02:30.029 --> 00:02:31.819
 with the highest honors 

00:02:31.819 --> 00:02:35.749
 at that time the government did not allow a woman to enter the university 

00:02:36.719 --> 00:02:38.250
 because you have to do it is not fair 

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:40.629
 being this also his goddess 

00:02:40.629 --> 00:02:43.629
 constituted for four years 

00:02:44.329 --> 00:02:47.969
 finally there would be enough money to sign easy 

00:02:47.969 --> 00:02:49.809
 gift of happy people 

00:02:49.809 --> 00:02:52.799
 barboza city need 

00:02:52.799 --> 00:02:55.609
 if they said the only thing that mattered to me 

00:02:55.609 --> 00:02:58.609
 with irony very little 

00:02:59.169 --> 00:03:01.169
 Well, look what to eat and sleep 

00:03:01.169 --> 00:03:04.509
 is what I like the most I always took 10 in those subjects 

00:03:05.949 --> 00:03:07.989
 I am the perfect man 

00:03:07.989 --> 00:03:10.989
 even though I had very little my dreams came true 

00:03:12.469 --> 00:03:16.689
 also three years later I graduated as a physicist and a year later 

00:03:16.689 --> 00:03:19.739
 pettitte as a mathematician 

00:03:19.739 --> 00:03:22.629
 I decided to dedicate my life to science 

00:03:22.629 --> 00:03:25.629
 had abandoned the idea is that both the macrismo 

00:03:26.589 --> 00:03:31.419
 but accidentally I met a professor from the university already killed 10 

00:03:32.409 --> 00:03:34.520
 he was only 35 

00:03:34.520 --> 00:03:37.520
 but he was already a famous scientist 

00:03:38.599 --> 00:03:41.599
 so much in common quintiq idea we fell in love 

00:03:43.769 --> 00:03:48.000
 pirillo legends regarding henri becquerel's experiments with the 

00:03:47.999 --> 00:03:49.969
 uranium element 

00:03:49.969 --> 00:03:52.459
 exposed that at the level that the capture 

00:03:52.459 --> 00:03:56.539
 the face plate covered with black paper so that it could not penetrate the light 

00:03:57.219 --> 00:04:01.839
 however when I was criticized the photographic plate looked like clothes 

00:04:01.839 --> 00:04:03.079
 and cazorla 

00:04:03.079 --> 00:04:06.079
 the uranium here in mexico your concerns 

00:04:07.409 --> 00:04:11.499
 in Madame Curie notice that I found a thing that dismisses as well as rays 

00:04:12.049 --> 00:04:14.339
 it is a fruit that is called every case 

00:04:14.339 --> 00:04:20.220
 gil pl cantinflas please pirillo we investigate all the elements 

00:04:20.219 --> 00:04:21.379
 known 

00:04:21.379 --> 00:04:25.099
 we already showed that about uranium and thorium intermediation 

00:04:26.120 --> 00:04:30.190
 yes I when we experience slow response a substance that contains uranium 

00:04:30.190 --> 00:04:34.749
 we found that they emitted more radiation than uranium by itself 

00:04:34.749 --> 00:04:38.740
 we were sure that the president contained a very intuitive element 

00:04:38.739 --> 00:04:46.719
 know illegitimate prove it we worked for four long years finally 

00:04:46.719 --> 00:04:48.930
 if we achieve our goal 

00:04:48.930 --> 00:04:51.430
 isolate the new element 

00:04:51.430 --> 00:04:56.280
 we had only a few soft ones but it was enough to prove that the 

00:04:56.280 --> 00:04:58.279
 what made happy 

00:04:58.279 --> 00:05:01.279
 with the model numbers not exactly 

00:05:03.240 --> 00:05:06.659
 many believe strategies that I hope we are clear 

00:05:06.659 --> 00:05:08.710
 among them the famous Nobel prize in me 

00:05:08.710 --> 00:05:10.610
 303 

00:05:10.610 --> 00:05:14.360
 but what was most important to us is that it was discovered that the 

00:05:14.360 --> 00:05:15.169
 radiation 

00:05:15.169 --> 00:05:18.539
 could be used to build diseased cells in the body 

00:05:19.080 --> 00:05:22.499
 my happiness for the discovery of the beam was truncated 

00:05:22.499 --> 00:05:25.499
 while investigating if they continue to exist 

00:05:25.999 --> 00:05:28.460
 that's very sad mr 

00:05:28.460 --> 00:05:31.900
 why it continues with the investigations that Kiril I had 

00:05:31.900 --> 00:05:33.189
 started 

00:05:33.189 --> 00:05:34.810
 in 1911 

00:05:34.810 --> 00:05:38.129
 I had the great luck of winning another prize 

00:05:38.129 --> 00:05:41.129
 nor the first woman that I believe 

00:05:41.639 --> 00:05:44.669
 shortly after the first war broke out 

00:05:44.669 --> 00:05:47.669
 nafisi as a volunteer to install ray equipment 

00:05:48.210 --> 00:05:51.719
 assayas cyclist if to take pictures of the inside of the body 

00:05:52.270 --> 00:05:55.270
 a great help for critics 

00:05:55.809 --> 00:05:59.889
 you have to do and on that x-ray you can see if all my bones 

00:05:59.889 --> 00:06:01.110
 they are in place 

00:06:01.110 --> 00:06:04.589
 that's not a toy that I should smile 

00:06:04.589 --> 00:06:07.249
 I think you've made a great discovery 

00:06:07.249 --> 00:06:08.590
 one more rib 

00:06:08.590 --> 00:06:12.060
 not find the keys that got lost in pop rock 

00:06:13.150 --> 00:06:14.919
 You hanged curie 

00:06:14.919 --> 00:06:17.270
 the woman world as that of terrassa and few 

00:06:17.270 --> 00:06:20.050
 he worked until the last day of his life 

00:06:20.050 --> 00:06:22.529
 luis gelid on the spot 

00:06:22.529 --> 00:06:26.959
 Random curi died of radiation internment the radiation that had 

00:06:26.959 --> 00:06:28.550
 tried to discover 

00:06:28.550 --> 00:06:31.759
 rt brave did not know the dangers 

00:06:31.759 --> 00:06:34.199
 but saved many others 

00:06:34.199 --> 00:06:37.960
 the example of curry kills lie precision ball 

00:06:37.960 --> 00:06:41.120
 you decided to keep trying to find the remedy for the cold 

00:06:41.939 --> 00:06:43.219
 obama sr 

00:06:43.219 --> 00:06:44.979
 I have decided to reinvent myself
