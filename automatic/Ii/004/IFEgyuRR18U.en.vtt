looking maybe sex fibers or so now you
can<00:02:29.860> see<00:02:29.980> I've<00:02:30.069> taught<00:02:30.580> off<00:02:30.760> from<00:02:31.060> the<00:02:31.180> fair

00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:31.420 
can see I've taught off from the fair

00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:35.070 
can see I've taught off from the fair
that<00:02:31.599> new<00:02:31.780> hold<00:02:32.230> these<00:02:32.470> end

00:02:35.070 --> 00:02:35.080 

00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:40.530 

bring<00:02:35.350> a<00:02:35.440> ton<00:02:35.680> round<00:02:35.950> a<00:02:37.950> list<00:02:38.950> done<00:02:39.390> and<00:02:40.390> then

00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:40.540 
bring a ton round a list done and then

00:02:40.540 --> 00:02:45.030 
bring a ton round a list done and then
draw<00:02:40.810> these<00:02:41.800> fibers<00:02:42.250> into<00:02:42.430> the<00:02:42.670> tap<00:02:42.910> so<00:02:44.040> you

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:45.040 
draw these fibers into the tap so you

00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:46.620 
draw these fibers into the tap so you
get<00:02:45.220> that's<00:02:45.430> natural<00:02:45.910> tapered<00:02:46.330> as<00:02:46.420> you<00:02:46.510> weigh

00:05:27.749 --> 00:05:28.420 
lot of fibers you see two or three five
rows<00:05:27.930> there

00:05:34.499 --> 00:05:38.749 
just mix it through the far and then we
can<00:05:34.649> double<00:05:36.860> take<00:05:37.860> a<00:05:37.889> team<00:05:38.219> you're<00:05:38.459> doing<00:05:38.639> it

00:05:38.749 --> 00:05:38.759 
can double take a team you're doing it

00:05:38.759 --> 00:05:47.929 
can double take a team you're doing it
just<00:05:38.789> nice<00:05:39.180> and<00:05:39.449> light<00:05:44.899> slide<00:05:45.899> out<00:05:46.759> and<00:05:47.759> then

00:05:47.929 --> 00:05:47.939 
just nice and light slide out and then

00:05:47.939 --> 00:05:51.889 
just nice and light slide out and then
they<00:05:48.180> contain<00:05:48.569> opps<00:05:48.809> that<00:05:48.930> way<00:05:50.419> the<00:05:51.419> way<00:05:51.569> we<00:05:51.599> do

00:05:51.889 --> 00:05:51.899 
they contain opps that way the way we do

00:05:51.899 --> 00:05:53.449 
they contain opps that way the way we do
is<00:05:51.959> take<00:05:52.139> a<00:05:52.169> ton<00:05:52.439> in<00:05:52.529> front<00:05:52.800> of<00:05:52.889> the<00:05:53.009> wing<00:05:53.159> buts

00:05:53.449 --> 00:05:53.459 
is take a ton in front of the wing buts

00:05:53.459 --> 00:05:57.439 
is take a ton in front of the wing buts
living<00:05:54.300> but<00:05:54.479> so<00:05:54.629> do<00:05:54.689> the<00:05:54.779> breathers<00:05:56.449> just

00:05:57.439 --> 00:05:57.449 
living but so do the breathers just

00:05:57.449 --> 00:05:59.480 
living but so do the breathers just
throw<00:05:57.719> about<00:05:57.809> these<00:05:58.139> fibers<00:05:58.620> I<00:05:58.800> think<00:05:59.309> another

00:05:59.480 --> 00:05:59.490 
throw about these fibers I think another

00:05:59.490 --> 00:06:02.239 
throw about these fibers I think another
ton<00:05:59.819> just<00:06:00.149> they're<00:06:00.330> just<00:06:00.740> like<00:06:01.740> the<00:06:01.860> left<00:06:02.069> side

00:06:02.239 --> 00:06:02.249 
ton just they're just like the left side

00:06:02.249 --> 00:06:05.989 
ton just they're just like the left side
up<00:06:02.809> no<00:06:03.809> I'm<00:06:04.469> gonna<00:06:04.649> use<00:06:04.740> some<00:06:05.309> varnish

00:06:05.989 --> 00:06:05.999 
up no I'm gonna use some varnish

00:06:05.999 --> 00:06:08.110 
up no I'm gonna use some varnish
wonderfully<00:06:06.689> a<00:06:06.719> test<00:06:06.990> point<00:06:07.169> about

00:06:08.110 --> 00:06:08.120 
wonderfully a test point about

00:06:08.120 --> 00:06:11.600 
wonderfully a test point about
centimeter<00:06:09.120> down<00:06:09.269> from<00:06:09.539> the<00:06:09.659> eye<00:06:10.339> in<00:06:11.339> thing

00:06:11.600 --> 00:06:11.610 
centimeter down from the eye in thing

00:06:11.610 --> 00:06:15.110 
centimeter down from the eye in thing
one<00:06:11.789> for<00:06:12.029> diode<00:06:12.330> drop<00:06:12.509> back<00:06:13.819> and<00:06:14.819> then<00:06:14.969> we<00:06:15.089> can

00:06:15.110 --> 00:06:15.120 
one for diode drop back and then we can

00:06:15.120 --> 00:06:18.110 
one for diode drop back and then we can
put<00:06:15.389> finish<00:06:15.719> over<00:06:15.990> that<00:06:16.199> tie<00:06:17.159> off<00:06:17.339> and<00:06:17.789> that's

00:06:18.110 --> 00:06:18.120 
put finish over that tie off and that's

00:06:18.120 --> 00:06:23.540 
put finish over that tie off and that's
it<00:06:19.249> will<00:06:20.249> be<00:06:20.370> a<00:06:20.399> thread<00:06:21.919> got<00:06:22.919> the<00:06:23.009> old<00:06:23.159> favorite

00:06:23.540 --> 00:06:23.550 
it will be a thread got the old favorite

00:06:23.550 --> 00:06:28.129 
it will be a thread got the old favorite
here<00:06:23.669> so<00:06:23.969> we<00:06:24.089> can<00:06:24.209> turn<00:06:24.419> these<00:06:24.569> away<00:06:27.139> the

00:06:28.129 --> 00:06:28.139 
here so we can turn these away the

00:06:28.139 --> 00:06:30.559 
here so we can turn these away the
breathers<00:06:29.069> we<00:06:29.249> can<00:06:29.399> trim<00:06:29.639> them<00:06:29.849> a<00:06:29.879> bit<00:06:30.120> maybe<00:06:30.479> a

00:06:30.559 --> 00:06:30.569 
breathers we can trim them a bit maybe a

00:06:30.569 --> 00:06:34.689 
breathers we can trim them a bit maybe a
mil<00:06:30.779> and<00:06:30.809> a<00:06:30.990> half<00:06:31.169> of<00:06:31.319> salt

00:06:34.689 --> 00:06:34.699 

00:06:34.699 --> 00:06:40.619 

really

00:06:40.619 --> 00:06:40.629 

00:06:40.629 --> 00:06:43.899 

now<00:06:41.629> they're<00:06:42.050> just<00:06:42.199> top<00:06:42.650> of<00:06:42.860> a<00:06:43.009> finger<00:06:43.550> with<00:06:43.759> us

00:06:43.899 --> 00:06:43.909 
now they're just top of a finger with us

00:06:43.909 --> 00:06:51.610 
now they're just top of a finger with us
spread<00:06:44.419> them<00:06:44.569> in<00:06:44.659> it<00:06:49.900> and<00:06:50.900> there<00:06:51.080> we<00:06:51.199> go

00:06:51.610 --> 00:06:51.620 
spread them in it and there we go

00:06:51.620 --> 00:06:54.309 
spread them in it and there we go
great<00:06:51.949> simple<00:06:52.400> very<00:06:52.759> simple<00:06:53.000> much<00:06:53.300> fun<00:06:53.569> time

blaming you name it sighs again you can

00:07:01.520 --> 00:07:03.059 
blaming you name it sighs again you can
go<00:07:01.639> smaller<00:07:01.699> than<00:07:02.150> us<00:07:02.210> you<00:07:02.360> go<00:07:02.479> much<00:07:02.719> bigger

00:07:03.059 --> 00:07:03.069 
go smaller than us you go much bigger

00:07:03.069 --> 00:07:05.309 
go smaller than us you go much bigger
because<00:07:04.069> we<00:07:04.280> do<00:07:04.430> get<00:07:04.580> definite<00:07:04.879> size<00:07:05.030> match

00:07:05.309 --> 00:07:05.319 
because we do get definite size match

00:07:05.319 --> 00:07:09.839 
because we do get definite size match
you<00:07:06.319> see<00:07:06.500> simplifying<00:07:07.099> it<00:07:07.219> a<00:07:07.990> very<00:07:08.990> productive

00:07:09.839 --> 00:07:09.849 
you see simplifying it a very productive

00:07:09.849 --> 00:07:13.210 
you see simplifying it a very productive
