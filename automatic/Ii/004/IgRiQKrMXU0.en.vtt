00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:32.400
 hello today we are getting ready to 

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:34.860
 to leave with the saur-sojasun team 

00:00:32.400 --> 00:00:36.180
 for endurance output this is the 

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:39.080
 start of season it will allow us to 

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:40.800
 review some concepts pma vo2max 

00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:42.809
 aerobics anaerobic threshold 

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:43.650
 is that what you're talking about 

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:47.160
 immediately turn to the 

00:00:43.650 --> 00:00:49.559
 coaches the vo2max is the consumption 

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:51.860
 maximum oxygen at an intensity 

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:54.450
 aerobic maximum 

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:56.110
 for example during a test in 

00:00:54.450 --> 00:00:59.320
 laboratory 

00:00:56.110 --> 00:01:02.140
 it's the last value of cosmos 

00:00:59.320 --> 00:01:03.730
 oxygen or the cardiovascular system 

00:01:02.140 --> 00:01:05.260
 and muscle are at most 

00:01:03.730 --> 00:01:07.210
 why it's important to know 

00:01:05.260 --> 00:01:08.950
 his confession of max it is necessary to the 

00:01:07.210 --> 00:01:12.670
 know to know its capacity 

00:01:08.950 --> 00:01:15.040
 maximum in intensity and power 

00:01:12.670 --> 00:01:17.500
 and ages and all gaits 

00:01:15.040 --> 00:01:18.760
 training to improve on 

00:01:17.500 --> 00:01:20.290
 field 

00:01:18.760 --> 00:01:21.550
 the maximum heart rate and the 

00:01:20.290 --> 00:01:24.000
 heart rate that comes with 

00:01:21.550 --> 00:01:24.000
 2 max 

00:01:30.860 --> 00:01:33.899
 the pma is the maximum power 

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:36.270
 aerobics 

00:01:33.899 --> 00:01:38.579
 it's somewhere synonymous with the bo 

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:41.520
 of max but for the cyclist the pma 

00:01:38.579 --> 00:01:43.560
 it is the power he develops with 

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:44.130
 o2 max the vo2max of a consumption 

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:46.409
 oxygen 

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:48.780
 the pma is a power realized in 

00:01:46.409 --> 00:01:50.039
 this oxygen consumption 

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:52.890
 sometimes we hear about the 

00:01:50.039 --> 00:01:55.799
 concept of vm at maximum aerobic speed 

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:58.170
 it's exactly the same notion as pma 

00:01:55.799 --> 00:02:00.270
 but by bike the use of speed 

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:02.580
 is limited because it is directly 

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:06.119
 related to topography and conditions 

00:02:02.580 --> 00:02:08.399
 climatic of practice a cyclist 

00:02:06.119 --> 00:02:10.259
 who practice in Brittany will not have 

00:02:08.399 --> 00:02:13.640
 the same speed as a cyclist who 

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:13.640
 practice in the mountains 

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:17.150
 Oh 

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:22.120
 Oh 

00:02:20.210 --> 00:02:26.209
 he 

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:29.420
 to know the intensity of work 

00:02:26.209 --> 00:02:31.069
 we have several tools the first tool 

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:33.530
 it's the perception 

00:02:31.069 --> 00:02:36.140
 so here's like for example if we do 

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:39.849
 anaerobic threshold work the 

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:43.280
 perception will be a big breathlessness 

00:02:39.849 --> 00:02:45.890
 struggling to speak the legs that starts 

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:49.099
 to burn these are all these little benchmarks 

00:02:45.890 --> 00:02:50.630
 in fact they are they are essential and 

00:02:49.099 --> 00:02:53.000
 finally they cost nothing there is not 

00:02:50.630 --> 00:02:57.290
 need material for another tool 

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:58.459
 the heart rate monitor the interest is to 

00:02:57.290 --> 00:03:00.560
 see in real time 

00:02:58.459 --> 00:03:03.049
 its heart rate during 

00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:05.860
 exercises or your sessions and so of 

00:03:03.049 --> 00:03:10.180
 measure by numbers your degree 

00:03:05.860 --> 00:03:10.180
 your peace faction used me 

00:03:17.110 --> 00:03:19.110
 at 

00:03:20.090 --> 00:03:25.560
 another tool exists since now 

00:03:23.610 --> 00:03:28.530
 a few years it's the sensor of 

00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:29.980
 power so the principle is 

00:03:28.530 --> 00:03:32.680
 to interview 

00:03:29.980 --> 00:03:35.590
 the energy that is deployed on the 

00:03:32.680 --> 00:03:38.739
 pedals this is a notion that is still 

00:03:35.590 --> 00:03:40.510
 fairly recent but going in the future 

00:03:38.739 --> 00:03:43.330
 it's tender that goes a little bit 

00:03:40.510 --> 00:03:44.620
 replace the heart rate monitor it's 

00:03:43.330 --> 00:03:45.180
 the same principle as the frequency 

00:03:44.620 --> 00:03:49.299
 cardiac 

00:03:45.180 --> 00:03:51.760
 we can see in instant the power 

00:03:49.299 --> 00:03:54.819
 developed throughout the course and 

00:03:51.760 --> 00:03:57.450
 therefore to legitimately adjust the fraction 

00:03:54.819 --> 00:03:57.450
 payment uses 

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:05.000
 1 

00:04:11.190 --> 00:04:14.690
