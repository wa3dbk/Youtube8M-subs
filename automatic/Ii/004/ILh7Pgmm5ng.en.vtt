Scott until I get my own butter I was
I've<00:00:17.340> done<00:00:17.550> a<00:00:17.580> bit<00:00:17.730> of<00:00:17.760> research<00:00:17.880> into<00:00:18.539> the<00:00:18.690> ID

00:00:19.609 --> 00:00:19.619 
I've done a bit of research into the ID

new<00:00:19.859> Ivy<00:00:20.039> Bridge<00:00:20.369> in<00:00:20.520> the<00:00:20.609> 3470<00:00:21.390> and<00:00:21.600> one<00:00:22.199> of

00:00:22.279 --> 00:00:22.289 
new Ivy Bridge in the 3470 and one of

00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:24.800 
new Ivy Bridge in the 3470 and one of
the<00:00:22.380> things<00:00:22.619> that<00:00:22.800> I<00:00:22.830> did<00:00:23.039> look<00:00:23.189> at<00:00:23.369> was<00:00:23.810> you

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:24.810 
the things that I did look at was you

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:27.710 
the things that I did look at was you
can<00:00:25.019> actually<00:00:25.170> overclock<00:00:25.680> the<00:00:25.710> CPU<00:00:25.830> now<00:00:26.720> by

00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:27.720 
can actually overclock the CPU now by

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:31.130 
can actually overclock the CPU now by
default<00:00:28.109> it<00:00:28.289> will<00:00:28.349> turbo<00:00:28.740> up<00:00:28.800> to<00:00:28.949> 3.6<00:00:29.840> now<00:00:30.840> I

00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:31.140 
default it will turbo up to 3.6 now I

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:32.749 
default it will turbo up to 3.6 now I
have<00:00:31.410> been<00:00:31.590> screwing<00:00:31.920> around<00:00:32.070> with<00:00:32.369> this<00:00:32.520> so

00:00:32.749 --> 00:00:32.759 
have been screwing around with this so

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:34.790 
have been screwing around with this so
normally<00:00:33.300> it's<00:00:33.510> probably<00:00:33.989> on<00:00:34.110> about<00:00:34.350> that<00:00:34.559> now

00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:34.800 
normally it's probably on about that now

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:37.850 
normally it's probably on about that now
got<00:00:35.700> a<00:00:35.730> couple<00:00:35.910> of<00:00:36.000> pictures<00:00:36.149> here<00:00:36.540> so<00:00:36.860> there's

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:37.860 
got a couple of pictures here so there's

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:41.090 
got a couple of pictures here so there's
that<00:00:38.489> one<00:00:38.670> from<00:00:38.850> the<00:00:39.000> BIOS<00:00:39.360> you<00:00:39.930> can<00:00:40.110> just<00:00:40.920> go

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:41.100 
that one from the BIOS you can just go

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:45.709 
that one from the BIOS you can just go
into<00:00:41.280> your<00:00:43.040> BIOS<00:00:44.040> and<00:00:44.480> find<00:00:45.480> your

00:00:45.709 --> 00:00:45.719 
into your BIOS and find your

00:00:45.719 --> 00:00:47.150 
into your BIOS and find your
overclocking<00:00:46.410> tweak<00:00:46.620> you<00:00:46.739> can<00:00:46.860> do<00:00:46.920> it<00:00:47.039> from

00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:47.160 
overclocking tweak you can do it from

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:52.479 
overclocking tweak you can do it from
there<00:00:48.050> with<00:00:49.050> this<00:00:49.559> with<00:00:50.190> the<00:00:50.280> 3470<00:00:51.000> you<00:00:51.270> can<00:00:51.390> do

00:00:52.479 --> 00:00:52.489 
there with this with the 3470 you can do

00:00:52.489 --> 00:00:58.880 
there with this with the 3470 you can do
4.40<00:00:53.489> and<00:00:54.020> 3.0<00:00:55.020> which<00:00:55.170> is<00:00:55.530> 3.8<00:00:57.649> pretty<00:00:58.649> much

00:00:58.880 --> 00:00:58.890 
4.40 and 3.0 which is 3.8 pretty much

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:01.900

all<00:00:59.190> you<00:00:59.370> need<00:00:59.399> to<00:00:59.640> do<00:00:59.730> is<00:00:59.940> just<00:01:00.149> adjust<00:01:00.300> the

00:01:01.900 --> 00:01:01.910 
all you need to do is just adjust the

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:14.430 
it's also a great way to gain some

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:17.090 
it's also a great way to gain some

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:32.610 
3d bios but you know particular need

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:33.950 
3d bios but you know particular need
that<00:01:32.759> most<00:01:32.970> of<00:01:33.150> manufacturers<00:01:33.780> will<00:01:33.930> have

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:33.960 
that most of manufacturers will have

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:35.569

00:02:45.860 --> 00:02:45.870 
program yeah seems all correct okay this

00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:47.150 
program yeah seems all correct okay this
is<00:02:45.989> probably<00:02:46.110> because<00:02:46.440> I<00:02:46.680> said<00:02:46.890> it<00:02:46.980> in<00:02:47.069> the

00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:47.160 
is probably because I said it in the

00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:49.190 
is probably because I said it in the
BIOS<00:02:47.430> before<00:02:47.760> note<00:02:47.970> there<00:02:48.330> you<00:02:48.420> go<00:02:48.630> went<00:02:48.989> to<00:02:49.080> X

00:02:49.190 --> 00:02:49.200 
BIOS before note there you go went to X

00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:52.550 
BIOS before note there you go went to X
39<00:02:49.650> so<00:02:50.400> yes<00:02:50.700> this<00:02:50.880> will<00:02:51.060> bump<00:02:51.540> up<00:02:51.750> the<00:02:51.870> 4.0<00:02:52.410> when

00:02:52.550 --> 00:02:52.560 
39 so yes this will bump up the 4.0 when

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:56.900 
39 so yes this will bump up the 4.0 when
it<00:02:52.680> needs<00:02:52.860> to<00:02:53.069> so<00:02:53.390> yeah<00:02:54.650> for<00:02:55.650> like<00:02:55.950> an<00:02:56.040> on<00:02:56.220> kcp
