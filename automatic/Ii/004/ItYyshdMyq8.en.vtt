00:00:00.330 --> 00:00:04.529
 hi friends i am ariana and school 

00:00:02.159 --> 00:00:07.709
 lightroom and today I bring you a tutorial 

00:00:04.529 --> 00:00:10.440
 on how to create an edge of your photos 

00:00:07.709 --> 00:00:12.570
 in the print module there are different 

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:15.719
 ways to create an edge and this is a 

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:17.820
 of the cruelest then we are in 

00:00:15.719 --> 00:00:21.019
 the print module make sure that here in 

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:24.269
 the first option say cost package 

00:00:21.019 --> 00:00:26.720
 why because if the others are not going 

00:00:24.269 --> 00:00:26.720
 function 

00:00:27.010 --> 00:00:34.180
 here I have a sheet that you can see is 

00:00:29.440 --> 00:00:35.830
 14 11 x 14 can be configured in this 

00:00:34.180 --> 00:00:37.510
 button here I've already told you how 

00:00:35.830 --> 00:00:39.190
 configure the page then I'm not going to 

00:00:37.510 --> 00:00:42.430
 To repeat 

00:00:39.190 --> 00:00:45.280
 I can put a link below for that 

00:00:42.430 --> 00:00:48.250
 video and I'm just going to drag the 

00:00:45.280 --> 00:00:50.860
 photo that I want towards the middle 

00:00:48.250 --> 00:00:52.800
 to look like a small picture and I'm going to 

00:00:50.860 --> 00:00:55.739
 drag up 

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:58.410
 and all the way to the beginning of the edge of 

00:00:55.739 --> 00:01:01.739
 the photo without stepping on anything else pressing 

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:04.129
 the mouse click I'm going to put all the 

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:06.799
 Photo 

00:01:04.129 --> 00:01:10.670
 covering the whole page if I need 

00:01:06.799 --> 00:01:13.909
 move it we can see it treading comment and 

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:16.939
 now here where is immersed links I'm going 

00:01:13.909 --> 00:01:20.000
 to put border forum or border of photo and 

00:01:16.939 --> 00:01:22.720
 they see that I see a very finite edge and 

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:22.720
 I can put it here 

00:01:23.380 --> 00:01:28.450
 and you can enlarge it and make it the edge 

00:01:26.079 --> 00:01:30.330
 of the size that I am 

00:01:28.450 --> 00:01:34.600
 to 

00:01:30.330 --> 00:01:37.390
 and I'm perfectly square 

00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:39.670
 if there is one here that is called and our 

00:01:37.390 --> 00:01:42.040
 which is like a line inside the edge 

00:01:39.670 --> 00:01:43.690
 as it is white it is not seen but we are going to 

00:01:42.040 --> 00:01:46.890
 black put to see what 

00:01:43.690 --> 00:01:50.460
 wants to say and ours that is like 

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:52.080
 an edge inside the edge then I 

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:53.820
 I can also put it before I give you a 

00:01:52.080 --> 00:01:56.310
 little more depth depending on the 

00:01:53.820 --> 00:02:00.270
 color that I used sometimes I like it like that to 

00:01:56.310 --> 00:02:02.390
 times nothing else without the edge if I so 

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:06.470
 least I want a much bigger edge 

00:02:02.390 --> 00:02:09.560
 can I just put this in blank 

00:02:06.470 --> 00:02:13.760
 I still get the picture a little more 

00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:16.580
 small but that is not necessary because 

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:20.480
 I can simply change the size 

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:23.510
 of the photo and put it and adjust it 

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:25.670
 put it smaller then here it's going 

00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:28.150
 to appear the edge the rest of the way 

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:32.170
 to create white those pictures 

00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:35.230
 about here in yongrit roles that nothing else 

00:02:32.170 --> 00:02:36.940
 if I take it off, it's just for me 

00:02:35.230 --> 00:02:39.970
 appear 

00:02:36.940 --> 00:02:42.820
 a guide to where my picture is then 

00:02:39.970 --> 00:02:45.190
 the lines that I'm seeing here is 

00:02:42.820 --> 00:02:48.350
 black line will not appear when 

00:02:45.190 --> 00:02:50.540
 export my photo ok 

00:02:48.350 --> 00:02:53.540
 to appear like this 

00:02:50.540 --> 00:02:55.270
 then depending on what I want 

00:02:53.540 --> 00:02:59.170
 I can put 

00:02:55.270 --> 00:03:02.110
 the whole picture and so I'm sure it's 

00:02:59.170 --> 00:03:04.150
 completely square now I can 

00:03:02.110 --> 00:03:07.390
 change the color of the edge but if it came 

00:03:04.150 --> 00:03:10.180
 here in the on the edge of the photo I do not 

00:03:07.390 --> 00:03:12.820
 appears in color only for the 

00:03:10.180 --> 00:03:15.340
 indoorshow that is the line that because 

00:03:12.820 --> 00:03:17.650
 is right here between the photo and the edge 

00:03:15.340 --> 00:03:22.990
 but if I give it here where it says page 

00:03:17.650 --> 00:03:27.100
 and I put color background that is the color 

00:03:22.990 --> 00:03:29.920
 of the background I can change it to black or 

00:03:27.100 --> 00:03:32.950
 any color that I want if I want 

00:03:29.920 --> 00:03:37.150
 blue red pink normally I always 

00:03:32.950 --> 00:03:39.280
 I base white black maximum gray but you 

00:03:37.150 --> 00:03:41.730
 I recommend that they stay between white 

00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:44.879
 and black for not 

00:03:41.730 --> 00:03:47.069
 and compromise the quality of the photo ok 

00:03:44.879 --> 00:03:49.230
 so yes I want black I leave it here in 

00:03:47.069 --> 00:03:51.239
 black 

00:03:49.230 --> 00:03:55.170
 and here it can be if I put a 

00:03:51.239 --> 00:03:56.909
 any immersion a white border can 

00:03:55.170 --> 00:03:58.760
 that looks good and highlights a little more 

00:03:56.909 --> 00:04:02.150
 the photo 

00:03:58.760 --> 00:04:06.700
 and that's it for me nothing more if I want 

00:04:02.150 --> 00:04:06.700
 change the photo grabbed and 

00:04:06.890 --> 00:04:14.200
 I change the photo and it will appear 

00:04:11.170 --> 00:04:15.940
 in the same frame and of course this 

00:04:14.200 --> 00:04:18.010
 I can always do a freezer now 

00:04:15.940 --> 00:04:20.200
 you know how to make three sets there 

00:04:18.010 --> 00:04:22.510
 I leave the link to make a floor 

00:04:20.200 --> 00:04:25.630
 from the pretty module and ready then 

00:04:22.510 --> 00:04:28.630
 continue here support and make sure you are 

00:04:25.630 --> 00:04:31.710
 in jpg if you want to take the image in 

00:04:28.630 --> 00:04:34.050
 digital can put your 

00:04:31.710 --> 00:04:36.600
 the watermark whatever you want 

00:04:34.050 --> 00:04:38.550
 and then they give it a lighthouse point and it has 

00:04:36.600 --> 00:04:40.260
