00:00:09.740 --> 00:00:18.960
 This technology is not just for me, it is life itself. 

00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:25.679
 I think I'm just a man of art. 

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:34.329
 The harp from the third grade junior high school, I began to learn that one in a long Haya 

00:00:25.679 --> 00:00:39.519
 I've got six so far I've been working on garlic. 

00:00:34.329 --> 00:00:42.859
 10 When I was 15 years old, I was a teacher , 

00:00:39.519 --> 00:00:49.710
 I have to go without rest. 

00:00:42.859 --> 00:00:54.289
 I think that I finally did look, especially about eating days of youth 

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:54.289
 You think you did not have a love affair . 

00:00:54.649 --> 00:01:05.130
 Jesus 

00:00:56.920 --> 00:01:09.310
 I thought I was casting like a human . Oh, 

00:01:05.130 --> 00:01:12.070
 I do not need to do art anymore. 

00:01:09.310 --> 00:01:16.479
 Sub-human 

00:01:12.070 --> 00:01:21.640
 The beast can not make Jesus the gold capital . 

00:01:16.479 --> 00:01:24.390
 The market value of the human being can know only the human right to sleep art car 

00:01:21.640 --> 00:01:24.390
 I think 

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:33.700
 So art has many different functions. 

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:42.479
 Feature 

00:01:33.700 --> 00:01:46.270
 Looking out the large stems and the entertainment features over again that the human soul 

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:48.400
 It's a function that stroking. 

00:01:46.270 --> 00:01:51.400
 But the car 

00:01:48.400 --> 00:01:59.680
 Rather than the amusing music 

00:01:51.400 --> 00:02:05.430
 I've been doing that kind of music that touches the human soul. 

00:01:59.680 --> 00:02:08.910
 That should've been thinking, and I'm still thinking of course that 

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:13.890
 The best way I think 

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:17.640
 The work of art itself is gonna be good I'm good 

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:20.520
 For example, the masses are popular these days 

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:25.440
 It's one of the four data stores. It's high. 

00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:29.400
 So why would not BeTeven think about the background 

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:35.540
 I think that art itself is a quality man. 

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:39.950
 I think that if the art is good, it will be popularized by itself . 

00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:51.230
 How do you do well? There are many kinds of things that are good. 

00:02:39.950 --> 00:02:55.849
 However, I think that it will express in the future according to society and history 

00:02:51.230 --> 00:02:58.129
 Now, there are a lot of dissatisfaction with the artists' 

00:02:55.849 --> 00:03:01.700
 Though 

00:02:58.129 --> 00:03:08.599
 I'm going to give it a try. 

00:03:01.700 --> 00:03:09.709
 First of all , I can not think of anything like Myeong-dong that made this art tree . 

00:03:08.599 --> 00:03:13.909
 Will 

00:03:09.709 --> 00:03:20.269
 This is what society is creating, because it's a window disorder. 

00:03:13.909 --> 00:03:21.980
 So , according to the change of society, good artists meet the society 

00:03:20.269 --> 00:03:25.810
 Artists 

00:03:21.980 --> 00:03:29.380
 It is b to sleep to be born 

00:03:25.810 --> 00:03:35.650
 In the end, 

00:03:29.380 --> 00:03:41.560
 I think that we create art is our history. 

00:03:35.650 --> 00:03:45.530
 Though I talked about 100 feet empty, Beethoven said that the western society 

00:03:41.560 --> 00:03:52.340
 19th century affection will make it. 

00:03:45.530 --> 00:03:55.319
 So, even in Korea, the public is more interested in art 

00:03:52.340 --> 00:04:01.889
 Ah Art Anyhow 

00:03:55.319 --> 00:04:05.430
 Jesus did not think about art 60 

00:04:01.889 --> 00:04:08.370
 Creating an arch arts and culture 

00:04:05.430 --> 00:04:12.150
 Such a mental footer 

00:04:08.370 --> 00:04:15.180
 This lively Sale 

00:04:12.150 --> 00:04:22.320
 So I think the human being has 1 

00:04:15.180 --> 00:04:28.080
 There is art . So, as long as my human being is , art is the land castle. 

00:04:22.320 --> 00:04:30.740
 I do not know the disappearance of man, but as long as there is an officer , 

00:04:28.080 --> 00:04:30.740
 I guess. 

00:04:31.889 --> 00:04:37.889
 With self-confidence in 

00:04:36.060 --> 00:04:47.120
 on 

00:04:37.889 --> 00:04:52.620
 If you find the world of your favorite sound, 

00:04:47.120 --> 00:04:57.719
 It would be something that the public would document 

00:04:52.620 --> 00:05:02.060
 This will no doubt have faith that 

00:04:57.719 --> 00:05:02.060
 Those will know.
