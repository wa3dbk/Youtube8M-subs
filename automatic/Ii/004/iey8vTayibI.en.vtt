be created if you're like I don't know
how<00:01:44.130> they<00:01:44.160> can<00:01:44.460> be<00:01:44.580> creative<00:01:45.060> and<00:01:46.070> i'll<00:01:47.070> hit

00:01:47.359 --> 00:01:47.369 
how they can be creative and i'll hit

00:01:47.369 --> 00:01:50.930 
how they can be creative and i'll hit
here<00:01:48.030> they<00:01:48.180> can<00:01:48.300> be<00:01:48.420> so<00:01:49.080> they<00:01:49.140> can<00:01:49.470> the<00:01:49.830> LFA<00:01:50.640> can

00:01:50.930 --> 00:01:50.940 
here they can be so they can the LFA can

00:01:50.940 --> 00:01:52.969 
here they can be so they can the LFA can
be<00:01:51.060> created<00:01:51.450> with<00:01:51.570> for<00:01:51.900> energy<00:01:52.350> crystals<00:01:52.830> in<00:01:52.920> a

this<00:01:57.960> is<00:01:57.990> more<00:01:58.710> this<00:01:59.220> is<00:01:59.399> kind<00:01:59.790> of<00:01:59.970> just<00:02:00.240> above

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:01.140 
this is more this is kind of just above

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:03.980 
this is more this is kind of just above
basic<00:02:01.500> but<00:02:02.220> you<00:02:02.550> will<00:02:02.759> want<00:02:03.030> to<00:02:03.149> know<00:02:03.270> this<00:02:03.540> for

00:02:03.980 --> 00:02:03.990 
basic but you will want to know this for

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:07.190 
basic but you will want to know this for
future<00:02:04.430> it's<00:02:05.430> how<00:02:05.550> this<00:02:05.759> can<00:02:05.970> listen<00:02:06.570> this<00:02:07.020> is

00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:07.200 
future it's how this can listen this is

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:12.170 
future it's how this can listen this is
for<00:02:08.390> all<00:02:09.390> signs<00:02:10.380> and<00:02:10.800> this<00:02:11.280> is<00:02:11.489> for<00:02:11.700> medium

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:12.180 
for all signs and this is for medium

00:02:33.570 --> 00:02:36.770 
see from this bat box it holds 40
thousand<00:02:34.170> EU<00:02:34.830> and<00:02:35.070> it<00:02:35.430> has<00:02:35.700> an<00:02:35.850> output<00:02:36.150> of<00:02:36.209> 32

00:02:36.770 --> 00:02:36.780 
thousand EU and it has an output of 32

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:40.160 
thousand EU and it has an output of 32
as<00:02:37.560> this<00:02:37.799> holds<00:02:38.269> 600,000<00:02:39.269> as<00:02:39.360> an<00:02:39.480> output<00:02:40.110> of

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:40.170 
as this holds 600,000 as an output of

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:43.360 
as this holds 600,000 as an output of
128<00:02:41.040> so<00:02:41.250> it's<00:02:41.400> a<00:02:41.459> lot<00:02:41.670> it's<00:02:41.970> a<00:02:42.330> lot<00:02:42.360> more<00:02:42.570> and

00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:43.370 
128 so it's a lot it's a lot more and

00:02:43.370 --> 00:02:47.750 
128 so it's a lot it's a lot more and
let's<00:02:44.370> say<00:02:44.610> kind<00:02:45.450> of<00:02:45.739> it's<00:02:46.739> used<00:02:47.040> for<00:02:47.220> much

00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:47.760 
let's say kind of it's used for much

00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:50.030 
let's say kind of it's used for much
bigger<00:02:48.030> buildings<00:02:48.510> like<00:02:48.930> I<00:02:49.140> don't<00:02:49.260> know<00:02:49.500> if

00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:50.040 
bigger buildings like I don't know if

00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:51.650 
bigger buildings like I don't know if
you<00:02:50.280> are<00:02:50.430> on<00:02:50.610> a<00:02:50.640> server<00:02:50.940> and<00:02:51.180> wanted<00:02:51.450> to<00:02:51.510> make

00:02:51.650 --> 00:02:51.660 
you are on a server and wanted to make

00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:53.720 
you are on a server and wanted to make
in<00:02:51.810> a<00:02:51.930> apartment<00:02:52.590> block<00:02:53.010> or<00:02:53.190> something<00:02:53.489> so<00:02:53.640> you

00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:53.730 
in a apartment block or something so you

00:02:53.730 --> 00:02:55.759 
in a apartment block or something so you
could<00:02:53.910> a<00:02:53.940> power<00:02:54.269> a<00:02:54.299> lot<00:02:54.660> a<00:02:54.930> lot<00:02:54.989> more<00:02:55.620> a<00:02:55.680> lot

00:02:55.759 --> 00:02:55.769 
could a power a lot a lot more a lot

00:02:55.769 --> 00:02:59.390 
could a power a lot a lot more a lot
quicker<00:02:56.130> and<00:02:57.110> okay<00:02:58.110> so<00:02:58.170> I've<00:02:58.680> shown<00:02:58.980> you<00:02:59.010> that

00:02:59.390 --> 00:02:59.400 
quicker and okay so I've shown you that

00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:01.100 
quicker and okay so I've shown you that
and<00:02:59.670> that's<00:02:59.970> just<00:03:00.090> not<00:03:00.420> great<00:03:00.570> version<00:03:00.900> of

00:03:01.100 --> 00:03:01.110 
and that's just not great version of

00:03:01.110 --> 00:03:02.160 
and that's just not great version of
that

00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:02.170 
that

00:03:02.170 --> 00:03:05.010 
that
and<00:03:02.590> these<00:03:02.920> the<00:03:03.459> medium<00:03:03.910> voltage<00:03:04.030> saw<00:03:04.630> a<00:03:04.660> race

00:03:05.010 --> 00:03:05.020 
and these the medium voltage saw a race

00:03:05.020 --> 00:03:06.420 
and these the medium voltage saw a race
or<00:03:05.290> I've<00:03:05.440> got<00:03:05.620> showing<00:03:05.950> you<00:03:06.010> how<00:03:06.160> to<00:03:06.190> make

00:03:06.420 --> 00:03:06.430 
or I've got showing you how to make

00:03:06.430 --> 00:03:11.309 
or I've got showing you how to make
these<00:03:06.580> is<00:03:06.849> made<00:03:07.720> with<00:03:08.050> and<00:03:09.480> low<00:03:10.480> voltage<00:03:11.020> all

00:03:11.309 --> 00:03:11.319 
these is made with and low voltage all

00:03:11.319 --> 00:03:14.460 
these is made with and low voltage all
around<00:03:11.830> an<00:03:12.099> env<00:03:12.819> transformer<00:03:13.630> which<00:03:14.110> is<00:03:14.290> just

00:03:14.460 --> 00:03:14.470 
around an env transformer which is just

00:03:14.470 --> 00:03:19.309 
around an env transformer which is just
that<00:03:15.120> a<00:03:16.120> machine<00:03:16.630> book<00:03:17.110> with<00:03:17.590> co<00:03:17.920> cable

00:03:19.309 --> 00:03:19.319 
that a machine book with co cable

00:03:19.319 --> 00:03:22.530 
that a machine book with co cable
surrounding<00:03:20.319> it<00:03:20.410> so<00:03:21.180> that's<00:03:22.180> how<00:03:22.330> you<00:03:22.390> make

00:03:22.530 --> 00:03:22.540 
surrounding it so that's how you make

00:03:22.540 --> 00:03:24.510 
surrounding it so that's how you make
that<00:03:22.750> and<00:03:23.590> now<00:03:23.709> i'm<00:03:23.800> going<00:03:23.920> to<00:03:24.010> show<00:03:24.160> you<00:03:24.190> the

00:03:24.510 --> 00:03:24.520 
that and now i'm going to show you the

00:03:24.520 --> 00:03:28.610 
that and now i'm going to show you the
final<00:03:25.270> upgrade<00:03:25.660> for<00:03:26.020> the<00:03:26.230> bat<00:03:26.470> box<00:03:26.880> which<00:03:27.880> is<00:03:27.910> a

00:03:28.610 --> 00:03:28.620 
final upgrade for the bat box which is a

00:03:28.620 --> 00:03:35.340 
final upgrade for the bat box which is a
NFS<00:03:29.620> you<00:03:29.830> our<00:03:30.340> holds<00:03:31.200> one<00:03:32.200> two<00:03:32.709> three<00:03:33.989> so<00:03:34.989> 10

00:03:35.340 --> 00:03:35.350 
NFS you our holds one two three so 10

00:03:35.350 --> 00:03:39.479 
NFS you our holds one two three so 10
million<00:03:35.830> EU<00:03:36.610> and<00:03:36.850> as<00:03:37.000> an<00:03:37.120> output<00:03:37.590> 512<00:03:38.590> so<00:03:39.370> this

00:03:39.479 --> 00:03:39.489 
million EU and as an output 512 so this

00:03:39.489 --> 00:03:41.640 
million EU and as an output 512 so this
would<00:03:39.670> be<00:03:39.700> used<00:03:40.060> one<00:03:40.600> of<00:03:40.630> these<00:03:40.810> could<00:03:41.170> power<00:03:41.530> a

00:03:41.640 --> 00:03:41.650 
would be used one of these could power a

00:03:41.650 --> 00:03:44.850 
would be used one of these could power a
whole<00:03:41.890> factory<00:03:42.370> and<00:03:42.519> pretty<00:03:42.730> sure<00:03:42.910> and<00:03:43.209> it<00:03:44.080> is

00:03:44.850 --> 00:03:44.860 
whole factory and pretty sure and it is

00:03:44.860 --> 00:03:46.830 
whole factory and pretty sure and it is
very<00:03:44.950> effective<00:03:45.790> you'll<00:03:46.180> definitely<00:03:46.720> need

00:03:46.830 --> 00:03:46.840 
very effective you'll definitely need

00:03:46.840 --> 00:03:51.710 
very effective you'll definitely need
double<00:03:47.440> insulated<00:03:47.920> go<00:03:48.670> cable<00:03:49.090> for<00:03:49.239> this<00:03:49.390> and

00:03:51.710 --> 00:03:51.720 
double insulated go cable for this and

00:03:51.720 --> 00:03:55.350 
double insulated go cable for this and
okay<00:03:52.720> so<00:03:52.780> I<00:03:53.019> need<00:03:53.260> those<00:03:53.730> now<00:03:54.730> to<00:03:54.790> show<00:03:55.090> you<00:03:55.150> how

00:03:55.350 --> 00:03:55.360 
okay so I need those now to show you how

00:03:55.360 --> 00:03:57.690 
okay so I need those now to show you how
to<00:03:55.420> make<00:03:55.540> high<00:03:55.930> voltage<00:03:56.380> solar<00:03:56.650> array<00:03:56.980> so<00:03:57.489> it's

00:03:57.690 --> 00:03:57.700 
to make high voltage solar array so it's

00:03:57.700 --> 00:03:59.460 
to make high voltage solar array so it's
much<00:03:57.910> the<00:03:57.940> same<00:03:58.090> as<00:03:58.480> all<00:03:58.690> the<00:03:58.720> other<00:03:58.959> solar

00:03:59.460 --> 00:03:59.470 
much the same as all the other solar

00:03:59.470 --> 00:04:01.830 
much the same as all the other solar
arrays<00:03:59.830> but<00:03:59.910> medium<00:04:00.910> voltage<00:04:01.060> around<00:04:01.750> the

00:04:01.830 --> 00:04:01.840 
arrays but medium voltage around the

00:04:01.840 --> 00:04:04.680 
arrays but medium voltage around the
outside<00:04:02.170> and<00:04:02.440> hv<00:04:03.040> transform<00:04:03.700> transform<00:04:04.360> in

00:04:04.680 --> 00:04:04.690 
outside and hv transform transform in

00:04:04.690 --> 00:04:07.259

the<00:04:04.780> milk<00:04:05.010> hv<00:04:06.010> transformer<00:04:06.370> is<00:04:06.820> made<00:04:07.000> with

00:04:07.259 --> 00:04:07.269 
the milk hv transformer is made with

00:04:07.269 --> 00:04:10.170 
the milk hv transformer is made with
copper<00:04:07.870> cables<00:04:08.260> tom<00:04:08.530> bottom<00:04:08.890> energy<00:04:09.700> crystal

00:04:10.170 --> 00:04:10.180 
copper cables tom bottom energy crystal

00:04:10.180 --> 00:04:13.349 
copper cables tom bottom energy crystal
their<00:04:10.739> electric<00:04:11.739> sip<00:04:12.070> it<00:04:12.370> electronic<00:04:13.030> circuit

00:04:13.349 --> 00:04:13.359 
their electric sip it electronic circuit

00:04:13.359 --> 00:04:16.020 
their electric sip it electronic circuit
there<00:04:13.510> where<00:04:13.810> i<00:04:13.840> was<00:04:13.959> sharing<00:04:14.170> like<00:04:14.440> an<00:04:15.030> energy

00:04:16.020 --> 00:04:16.030 
there where i was sharing like an energy

00:04:16.030 --> 00:04:18.870 
there where i was sharing like an energy
crystal<00:04:16.419> it's<00:04:17.079> like<00:04:17.410> so<00:04:17.890> and<00:04:18.220> there's<00:04:18.370> dymond

00:04:18.870 --> 00:04:18.880 
crystal it's like so and there's dymond

00:04:18.880 --> 00:04:23.610 
crystal it's like so and there's dymond
there<00:04:19.419> and<00:04:20.190> and<00:04:21.190> then<00:04:21.700> a<00:04:21.850> MV<00:04:22.780> transform<00:04:23.410> which

00:04:23.610 --> 00:04:23.620 
there and and then a MV transform which

00:04:23.620 --> 00:04:27.000 
there and and then a MV transform which
was<00:04:24.100> made<00:04:24.700> like<00:04:24.910> this<00:04:25.210> in<00:04:25.510> the<00:04:25.720> middle<00:04:25.960> so<00:04:26.800> this

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:27.010 
was made like this in the middle so this

00:04:27.010 --> 00:04:30.839 
was made like this in the middle so this
you<00:04:27.160> definitely<00:04:27.400> need<00:04:27.820> these<00:04:28.030> cables

00:04:30.839 --> 00:04:30.849 

00:04:30.849 --> 00:04:32.609 

and<00:04:30.939> there's<00:04:31.419> a<00:04:31.509> lot<00:04:31.749> higher<00:04:31.959> chance<00:04:32.319> of<00:04:32.469> it

00:04:32.609 --> 00:04:32.619 
and there's a lot higher chance of it

00:04:32.619 --> 00:04:37.219 
and there's a lot higher chance of it
exploding<00:04:33.279> well<00:04:34.860> what<00:04:35.860> what<00:04:36.520> happened<00:04:36.819> that

00:04:37.219 --> 00:04:37.229 
exploding well what what happened that

00:04:37.229 --> 00:04:40.649 
exploding well what what happened that
yeah<00:04:38.229> I<00:04:38.259> think<00:04:38.439> I<00:04:38.559> need<00:04:38.619> a<00:04:39.330> four<00:04:40.330> times

00:04:40.649 --> 00:04:40.659 
yeah I think I need a four times

00:04:40.659 --> 00:04:43.139 
yeah I think I need a four times
insulated<00:04:41.499> copper<00:04:42.219> cable<00:04:42.639> because<00:04:42.759> it<00:04:42.879> cannot

00:04:43.139 --> 00:04:43.149 
insulated copper cable because it cannot

00:04:43.149 --> 00:04:46.529 
insulated copper cable because it cannot
handle<00:04:43.599> and<00:04:44.159> anything<00:04:45.159> otherwise<00:04:45.520> so<00:04:46.179> there's

00:04:46.529 --> 00:04:46.539 
handle and anything otherwise so there's

00:04:46.539 --> 00:04:49.350 
handle and anything otherwise so there's
two<00:04:46.929> times<00:04:47.319> all<00:04:48.309> know<00:04:48.580> you<00:04:48.639> need<00:04:48.879> four<00:04:49.119> times

00:04:49.350 --> 00:04:49.360 
two times all know you need four times

00:04:49.360 --> 00:04:52.139

iron in a diamond I did not know that so

00:05:03.639 --> 00:05:06.509 
iron in a diamond I did not know that so
I<00:05:03.669> need<00:05:03.909> a<00:05:04.119> lot<00:05:04.449> of<00:05:04.479> those<00:05:04.659> you<00:05:04.899> need<00:05:05.519> four

00:05:06.509 --> 00:05:06.519 
I need a lot of those you need four

00:05:06.519 --> 00:05:08.369 
I need a lot of those you need four
times<00:05:06.789> insulated<00:05:07.479> the<00:05:07.569> reason<00:05:07.869> you<00:05:07.959> need<00:05:08.139> four

00:05:08.369 --> 00:05:08.379 
times insulated the reason you need four

00:05:08.379 --> 00:05:10.739 
times insulated the reason you need four
times<00:05:08.589> insulated<00:05:09.309> is<00:05:09.459> less<00:05:09.729> chance<00:05:10.269> of<00:05:10.419> shock

00:05:10.739 --> 00:05:10.749 
times insulated is less chance of shock

00:05:10.749 --> 00:05:15.499 
times insulated is less chance of shock
and<00:05:11.699> shot<00:05:12.699> is<00:05:12.879> more<00:05:13.300> shock<00:05:13.539> resistance<00:05:14.110> and<00:05:14.439> in

00:05:15.499 --> 00:05:15.509 
and shot is more shock resistance and in

00:05:15.509 --> 00:05:22.949 
and shot is more shock resistance and in
and<00:05:16.529> less<00:05:17.529> own<00:05:17.889> power<00:05:18.879> like<00:05:19.499> loss<00:05:20.499> when<00:05:21.959> when

00:05:22.949 --> 00:05:22.959 
and less own power like loss when when

00:05:22.959 --> 00:05:24.629 
and less own power like loss when when
traveling<00:05:23.439> so<00:05:23.769> they're<00:05:23.919> pretty<00:05:24.129> much<00:05:24.189> been<00:05:24.490> no

00:05:24.629 --> 00:05:24.639 
traveling so they're pretty much been no

00:05:24.639 --> 00:05:26.939 
traveling so they're pretty much been no
power<00:05:24.909> loss<00:05:25.179> so<00:05:25.719> see<00:05:25.959> how<00:05:25.990> big<00:05:26.259> these<00:05:26.409> are<00:05:26.709> so

00:05:26.939 --> 00:05:26.949 
power loss so see how big these are so

00:05:26.949 --> 00:05:30.239 
power loss so see how big these are so
you<00:05:27.939> power<00:05:28.209> it<00:05:28.330> look<00:05:28.779> at<00:05:28.899> that<00:05:29.050> it's<00:05:29.349> just<00:05:29.619> poor

00:05:30.239 --> 00:05:30.249 
you power it look at that it's just poor

00:05:30.249 --> 00:05:31.949 
you power it look at that it's just poor
that's<00:05:30.849> a<00:05:30.999> lot<00:05:31.179> of<00:05:31.240> power<00:05:31.509> going<00:05:31.689> through

00:05:31.949 --> 00:05:31.959 
that's a lot of power going through

00:05:31.959 --> 00:05:33.899 
that's a lot of power going through
there<00:05:32.139> so<00:05:32.800> these<00:05:32.979> will<00:05:33.279> be<00:05:33.429> able<00:05:33.550> to<00:05:33.669> pretty

00:05:33.899 --> 00:05:33.909 
there so these will be able to pretty

00:05:33.909 --> 00:05:37.489 
there so these will be able to pretty
much<00:05:34.059> power<00:05:34.479> anything<00:05:35.579> pretty<00:05:36.579> quickly<00:05:37.029> like

00:05:37.489 --> 00:05:37.499 
much power anything pretty quickly like

00:05:37.499 --> 00:05:40.739 
much power anything pretty quickly like
agency<00:05:38.499> that's<00:05:38.619> filled<00:05:39.099> up<00:05:39.309> six<00:05:39.909> steer

00:05:40.739 --> 00:05:40.749 
agency that's filled up six steer

00:05:40.749 --> 00:05:44.100 
agency that's filled up six steer
600,000<00:05:41.709> this<00:05:42.279> is<00:05:42.550> just<00:05:42.939> hit<00:05:43.119> 600,000<00:05:43.959> just

00:05:44.100 --> 00:05:44.110 
600,000 this is just hit 600,000 just

00:05:44.110 --> 00:05:44.930 
600,000 this is just hit 600,000 just
then

00:05:44.930 --> 00:05:44.940 
then

00:05:44.940 --> 00:05:49.310 
then
a<00:05:45.000> few<00:05:45.780> seconds<00:05:46.200> so<00:05:46.620> that<00:05:47.180> so<00:05:48.180> this<00:05:48.480> is<00:05:48.750> really

00:05:49.310 --> 00:05:49.320 
a few seconds so that so this is really

00:05:49.320 --> 00:05:52.430 
a few seconds so that so this is really
like<00:05:49.830> this<00:05:50.430> could<00:05:50.820> probably<00:05:51.270> all<00:05:51.810> be<00:05:52.110> all<00:05:52.290> you

00:05:52.430 --> 00:05:52.440 
like this could probably all be all you

00:05:52.440 --> 00:05:55.010 
like this could probably all be all you
need<00:05:52.470> for<00:05:52.950> a<00:05:53.010> factory<00:05:53.460> just<00:05:53.820> this<00:05:54.060> but<00:05:54.900> again

00:05:55.010 --> 00:05:55.020 
need for a factory just this but again

00:05:55.020 --> 00:05:57.620 
need for a factory just this but again
it<00:05:55.230> is<00:05:55.350> very<00:05:55.590> expensive<00:05:56.240> so<00:05:57.240> here<00:05:57.450> are<00:05:57.570> the

00:05:57.620 --> 00:05:57.630 
it is very expensive so here are the

00:05:57.630 --> 00:06:01.550 
it is very expensive so here are the
three<00:05:57.930> types<00:05:57.960> of<00:05:59.420> kind<00:06:00.420> of<00:06:00.510> energy<00:06:00.660> stores<00:06:01.170> and

00:06:01.550 --> 00:06:01.560 
three types of kind of energy stores and

00:06:01.560 --> 00:06:03.590 
three types of kind of energy stores and
edge<00:06:01.680> of<00:06:01.860> energy<00:06:02.250> makers<00:06:02.580> using<00:06:02.850> solar<00:06:03.180> panels

00:06:03.590 --> 00:06:03.600 
edge of energy makers using solar panels

00:06:03.600 --> 00:06:06.380 
edge of energy makers using solar panels
and<00:06:03.830> solar<00:06:04.830> panels<00:06:05.280> are<00:06:05.400> definitely<00:06:06.240> my

00:06:06.380 --> 00:06:06.390 
and solar panels are definitely my

00:06:06.390 --> 00:06:09.110 
and solar panels are definitely my
favorite<00:06:06.840> and<00:06:07.160> way<00:06:08.160> of<00:06:08.370> power<00:06:08.700> other<00:06:08.970> than

00:06:09.110 --> 00:06:09.120 
favorite and way of power other than

00:06:09.120 --> 00:06:11.540 
favorite and way of power other than
nuclear<00:06:09.480> energy<00:06:09.870> but<00:06:10.500> i'll<00:06:10.650> just<00:06:11.070> put<00:06:11.340> more

00:06:11.540 --> 00:06:11.550 
nuclear energy but i'll just put more

00:06:11.550 --> 00:06:14.720 
nuclear energy but i'll just put more
videos<00:06:11.820> on<00:06:12.000> that<00:06:12.030> later<00:06:12.390> and<00:06:13.280> yes<00:06:14.280> I<00:06:14.460> guys
