sand filter you have you know we have

00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:12.709 
sand filter you have you know we have
well<00:00:10.110> we<00:00:10.139> have<00:00:10.410> filter<00:00:10.999> you<00:00:11.999> have<00:00:12.030> backwash

00:00:12.709 --> 00:00:12.719 
well we have filter you have backwash

00:00:12.719 --> 00:00:15.439 
well we have filter you have backwash
you<00:00:13.589> have<00:00:13.769> rinse<00:00:14.070> there<00:00:14.820> are<00:00:14.969> three<00:00:15.269> other

00:00:15.439 --> 00:00:15.449 
you have rinse there are three other

00:00:15.449 --> 00:00:18.169 
you have rinse there are three other
positions<00:00:16.110> on<00:00:16.289> the<00:00:16.590> back<00:00:16.770> on<00:00:17.010> the<00:00:17.250> filter<00:00:17.640> that

00:00:18.169 --> 00:00:18.179 
positions on the back on the filter that

00:00:18.179 --> 00:00:20.330 
positions on the back on the filter that
really<00:00:18.599> aren't<00:00:18.869> that<00:00:18.990> important<00:00:19.650> closed

00:00:20.330 --> 00:00:20.340 
really aren't that important closed

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:22.640 
really aren't that important closed
position<00:00:21.089> well<00:00:21.630> if<00:00:21.839> you're<00:00:22.019> going<00:00:22.320> to<00:00:22.470> do

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:22.650 
position well if you're going to do

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:24.169 
position well if you're going to do
something<00:00:22.949> with<00:00:23.220> your<00:00:23.339> pump<00:00:23.609> you<00:00:23.849> can<00:00:24.029> move

00:00:24.169 --> 00:00:24.179 
something with your pump you can move

00:00:24.179 --> 00:00:26.029 
something with your pump you can move
the<00:00:24.359> valve<00:00:24.570> head<00:00:24.810> to<00:00:24.990> the<00:00:25.109> closed<00:00:25.380> position

00:00:26.029 --> 00:00:26.039 
the valve head to the closed position

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:28.249 
the valve head to the closed position
and<00:00:26.189> it<00:00:26.490> keeps<00:00:26.699> water<00:00:27.029> from<00:00:27.150> coming<00:00:27.599> back<00:00:27.779> in

00:00:28.249 --> 00:00:28.259 
and it keeps water from coming back in

00:00:28.259 --> 00:00:31.429 
and it keeps water from coming back in
there's<00:00:29.070> a<00:00:29.189> recirculate<00:00:30.089> position<00:00:30.779> you<00:00:31.320> know

00:00:31.429 --> 00:00:31.439 
there's a recirculate position you know

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:33.860 
there's a recirculate position you know
on<00:00:31.619> recirculate<00:00:32.400> water<00:00:32.640> comes<00:00:33.420> through<00:00:33.750> the

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:33.870 
on recirculate water comes through the

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:35.780 
on recirculate water comes through the
pump<00:00:34.140> goes<00:00:34.740> through<00:00:35.010> the<00:00:35.160> valve<00:00:35.280> head<00:00:35.550> and

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:35.790 
pump goes through the valve head and

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:37.610 
pump goes through the valve head and
back<00:00:36.030> to<00:00:36.240> the<00:00:36.330> pool<00:00:36.510> but<00:00:37.050> doesn't<00:00:37.380> go<00:00:37.470> through

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:37.620 
back to the pool but doesn't go through

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:38.300 
back to the pool but doesn't go through
the<00:00:37.770> filter

00:00:38.300 --> 00:00:38.310 
the filter

00:00:38.310 --> 00:00:41.300 
the filter
well<00:00:38.850> why<00:00:39.030> circulate<00:00:39.810> water<00:00:40.140> and<00:00:40.500> not<00:00:41.040> clean

00:00:41.300 --> 00:00:41.310 
well why circulate water and not clean

00:00:41.310 --> 00:00:43.970 
well why circulate water and not clean
it<00:00:41.490> it<00:00:42.150> makes<00:00:42.420> no<00:00:42.630> sense<00:00:42.660> so<00:00:43.410> I've<00:00:43.530> never<00:00:43.800> ever

00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:43.980 
it it makes no sense so I've never ever

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:46.310 
it it makes no sense so I've never ever
used<00:00:44.310> the<00:00:44.430> recirculate<00:00:45.000> position<00:00:45.480> the<00:00:46.080> last

00:00:46.310 --> 00:00:46.320 
used the recirculate position the last

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:49.670 
used the recirculate position the last
position<00:00:47.330> winterize<00:00:48.330> is<00:00:48.690> really<00:00:49.350> just<00:00:49.590> to

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:49.680 
position winterize is really just to

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:51.770 
position winterize is really just to
keep<00:00:49.860> your<00:00:50.070> valve<00:00:50.250> head<00:00:50.520> from<00:00:50.700> freezing<00:00:51.240> and<00:00:51.420> I

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:51.780 
keep your valve head from freezing and I

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:54.640 
keep your valve head from freezing and I
recommend<00:00:52.140> taking<00:00:52.530> the<00:00:52.830> valve<00:00:53.010> head<00:00:53.250> inside

00:00:54.640 --> 00:00:54.650 
recommend taking the valve head inside

00:00:54.650 --> 00:00:56.900 
recommend taking the valve head inside
you<00:00:55.650> know<00:00:55.740> during<00:00:55.980> the<00:00:56.130> wintertime<00:00:56.400> to<00:00:56.760> keep

00:00:56.900 --> 00:00:56.910 
you know during the wintertime to keep

00:00:56.910 --> 00:00:59.450 
you know during the wintertime to keep
it<00:00:57.060> from<00:00:57.180> freezing<00:00:57.740> finally<00:00:58.740> there<00:00:58.980> is<00:00:59.010> pump

00:00:59.450 --> 00:00:59.460 
it from freezing finally there is pump

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:02.030 
it from freezing finally there is pump
to<00:00:59.700> waste<00:01:00.080> now<00:01:01.080> pump<00:01:01.380> the<00:01:01.530> waste<00:01:01.740> is<00:01:01.980> a

00:01:02.030 --> 00:01:02.040 
to waste now pump the waste is a

00:01:02.040 --> 00:01:05.090 
to waste now pump the waste is a
position<00:01:02.790> that<00:01:03.240> a<00:01:03.300> lot<00:01:03.600> of<00:01:03.630> people<00:01:04.080> use<00:01:04.409> in<00:01:04.650> the

00:01:05.090 --> 00:01:05.100 
position that a lot of people use in the

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:07.460 
position that a lot of people use in the
springtime<00:01:05.540> basically<00:01:06.540> you<00:01:06.720> know<00:01:06.840> unplug<00:01:07.320> the

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:07.470 
springtime basically you know unplug the

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:10.370 
springtime basically you know unplug the
pump<00:01:07.710> move<00:01:08.340> it<00:01:08.460> to<00:01:08.580> pump<00:01:08.820> to<00:01:08.910> waste<00:01:09.210> now<00:01:10.020> what's

00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:10.380 
pump move it to pump to waste now what's

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:12.590 
pump move it to pump to waste now what's
happening<00:01:10.890> is<00:01:11.100> the<00:01:11.730> water<00:01:11.970> is<00:01:12.120> coming<00:01:12.390> into

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:12.600 
happening is the water is coming into

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:14.900 
happening is the water is coming into
the<00:01:12.840> pump<00:01:13.080> it's<00:01:13.830> going<00:01:14.190> to<00:01:14.340> the<00:01:14.430> valve<00:01:14.610> head

00:01:14.900 --> 00:01:14.910 
the pump it's going to the valve head

00:01:14.910 --> 00:01:17.230 
the pump it's going to the valve head
but<00:01:15.420> it's<00:01:15.540> being<00:01:15.750> pumped<00:01:16.140> out<00:01:16.410> of<00:01:16.890> the

00:01:17.230 --> 00:01:17.240 
but it's being pumped out of the

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:20.990 
but it's being pumped out of the
backwash<00:01:18.240> port<00:01:18.659> so<00:01:19.620> water<00:01:19.980> is<00:01:20.159> coming<00:01:20.370> in<00:01:20.670> but

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:21.000 
backwash port so water is coming in but

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:22.880 
backwash port so water is coming in but
it's<00:01:21.120> bypassing<00:01:21.840> the<00:01:21.960> filter<00:01:22.350> and<00:01:22.560> it's

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:22.890 
it's bypassing the filter and it's

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:24.290 
it's bypassing the filter and it's
running<00:01:23.130> over<00:01:23.370> towards<00:01:23.850> your<00:01:23.940> neighbor's

00:01:24.290 --> 00:01:24.300 
running over towards your neighbor's

00:01:24.300 --> 00:01:26.960 
running over towards your neighbor's
yard<00:01:24.560> what<00:01:25.560> can<00:01:25.740> happen<00:01:25.920> is<00:01:26.280> if<00:01:26.520> the<00:01:26.550> cover

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:26.970 
yard what can happen is if the cover

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:29.330 
yard what can happen is if the cover
comes<00:01:27.270> off<00:01:27.510> in<00:01:27.750> the<00:01:27.780> wintertime<00:01:28.080> or<00:01:28.620> you<00:01:29.220> know

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:29.340 
comes off in the wintertime or you know

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:30.950 
comes off in the wintertime or you know
I<00:01:29.370> hate<00:01:29.550> to<00:01:29.700> say<00:01:29.850> you<00:01:29.909> forgot<00:01:30.360> to<00:01:30.540> cover<00:01:30.780> it

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:30.960 
I hate to say you forgot to cover it

really dirty and you want to filter you
want<00:01:36.180> to<00:01:36.780> just<00:01:37.050> pump<00:01:37.290> it<00:01:37.440> down<00:01:37.710> really<00:01:38.040> fast

the<00:01:54.870> waste<00:01:55.080> allows<00:01:55.470> you<00:01:55.680> to<00:01:55.799> suck<00:01:56.190> water<00:01:56.729> from

00:01:57.050 --> 00:01:57.060 
the waste allows you to suck water from

00:01:57.060 --> 00:01:59.480 
the waste allows you to suck water from
the<00:01:57.180> bottom<00:01:57.600> of<00:01:57.690> the<00:01:57.750> pool<00:01:57.930> vacuuming<00:01:58.680> and<00:01:58.860> out

00:01:59.480 --> 00:01:59.490 
the bottom of the pool vacuuming and out

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:02.420 
the bottom of the pool vacuuming and out
and<00:01:59.820> so<00:02:00.750> it<00:02:00.869> can<00:02:01.110> be<00:02:01.140> a<00:02:01.380> good<00:02:01.619> position<00:02:02.010> to<00:02:02.310> use

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:02.430 
and so it can be a good position to use

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:04.010 
and so it can be a good position to use
every<00:02:02.790> once<00:02:03.000> in<00:02:03.150> a<00:02:03.210> while<00:02:03.360> especially<00:02:03.479> if<00:02:03.930> your

00:02:04.010 --> 00:02:04.020 
every once in a while especially if your

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:06.289 
every once in a while especially if your
pool<00:02:04.200> ever<00:02:04.350> gets<00:02:04.560> really<00:02:04.890> dirty<00:02:05.150> it's<00:02:06.150> been

00:02:06.289 --> 00:02:06.299 
pool ever gets really dirty it's been

00:02:06.299 --> 00:02:08.660 
pool ever gets really dirty it's been
let<00:02:06.479> go<00:02:06.720> or<00:02:07.049> in<00:02:07.170> the<00:02:07.260> springtime<00:02:07.650> just<00:02:08.099> pump

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:08.670 
let go or in the springtime just pump

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:10.969 
let go or in the springtime just pump
the<00:02:08.789> waste<00:02:08.970> pump<00:02:09.330> it<00:02:09.479> all<00:02:09.539> out<00:02:09.779> push<00:02:10.439> some<00:02:10.649> put

00:02:10.969 --> 00:02:10.979 
the waste pump it all out push some put

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:13.569 
the waste pump it all out push some put
some<00:02:11.159> fresh<00:02:11.430> water<00:02:11.639> back<00:02:11.969> in<00:02:12.209> and<00:02:12.420> you're<00:02:12.900> good

00:02:13.569 --> 00:02:13.579 
some fresh water back in and you're good

00:02:13.579 --> 00:02:15.440 
some fresh water back in and you're good
so<00:02:14.579> that's<00:02:14.909> the<00:02:15.120> way<00:02:15.269> a

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:15.450 
so that's the way a

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:18.559 
so that's the way a
sand<00:02:15.660> filter<00:02:16.170> works<00:02:16.680> water<00:02:17.580> comes<00:02:17.879> in<00:02:18.180> runs

00:02:18.559 --> 00:02:18.569 
sand filter works water comes in runs

00:02:18.569 --> 00:02:21.160 
sand filter works water comes in runs
through<00:02:18.810> the<00:02:18.900> sand<00:02:19.200> saying<00:02:20.099> traps<00:02:20.489> the<00:02:20.760> dirt

00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:21.170 
through the sand saying traps the dirt

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:24.050 
through the sand saying traps the dirt
water<00:02:22.170> gets<00:02:22.440> pumped<00:02:22.739> back<00:02:22.890> to<00:02:23.099> the<00:02:23.220> pool<00:02:23.430> you

00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:24.060 
water gets pumped back to the pool you

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:26.390 
water gets pumped back to the pool you
backwash<00:02:24.720> you<00:02:24.870> to<00:02:24.989> clean<00:02:25.230> it<00:02:25.260> rinse<00:02:26.069> it<00:02:26.250> to

00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:26.400 
backwash you to clean it rinse it to

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:28.430 
backwash you to clean it rinse it to
receipt<00:02:26.819> it<00:02:27.000> and<00:02:27.180> the<00:02:27.629> other<00:02:27.780> position<00:02:28.319> that

00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:28.440 
receipt it and the other position that

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:30.170 
receipt it and the other position that
you<00:02:28.560> might<00:02:28.739> want<00:02:28.950> to<00:02:29.010> consider<00:02:29.340> using<00:02:29.580> is<00:02:29.879> pump

00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:30.180 
you might want to consider using is pump

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:32.030 
you might want to consider using is pump
to<00:02:30.330> waste<00:02:30.540> if<00:02:30.840> you're<00:02:31.290> just<00:02:31.440> going<00:02:31.590> to<00:02:31.650> pump<00:02:31.920> a

00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:32.040 
to waste if you're just going to pump a

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:33.740 
to waste if you're just going to pump a
lot<00:02:32.160> of<00:02:32.280> water<00:02:32.489> out<00:02:32.580> now<00:02:33.150> one<00:02:33.360> thing<00:02:33.540> I<00:02:33.720> should

00:02:33.740 --> 00:02:33.750 
lot of water out now one thing I should

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:37.160 
lot of water out now one thing I should
mention<00:02:34.940> whenever<00:02:35.940> a<00:02:36.150> sand<00:02:36.510> filter<00:02:36.720> is<00:02:37.080> very

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:37.170 
mention whenever a sand filter is very

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:40.009 
mention whenever a sand filter is very
new<00:02:37.650> because<00:02:38.489> it's<00:02:38.640> very<00:02:38.790> clean<00:02:39.150> or<00:02:39.420> you've

00:02:40.009 --> 00:02:40.019 
new because it's very clean or you've

00:02:40.019 --> 00:02:42.830 
new because it's very clean or you've
just<00:02:40.050> back<00:02:40.830> washed<00:02:41.190> it<00:02:41.430> that<00:02:41.940> pump<00:02:42.330> is<00:02:42.540> pumping

00:02:42.830 --> 00:02:42.840 
just back washed it that pump is pumping

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:45.350 
just back washed it that pump is pumping
very<00:02:43.260> effectively<00:02:43.830> and<00:02:44.160> so<00:02:44.700> it's<00:02:44.819> moving<00:02:45.120> an

00:02:45.350 --> 00:02:45.360 
very effectively and so it's moving an

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:47.000 
very effectively and so it's moving an
awful<00:02:45.750> lot<00:02:45.840> of<00:02:45.870> water<00:02:46.110> remember<00:02:46.530> I<00:02:46.590> said<00:02:46.860> the

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:47.010 
awful lot of water remember I said the

00:02:47.010 --> 00:02:49.009 
awful lot of water remember I said the
water<00:02:47.160> coming<00:02:47.549> back<00:02:47.730> in<00:02:48.000> looks<00:02:48.690> like<00:02:48.780> the

00:02:49.009 --> 00:02:49.019 
water coming back in looks like the

00:02:49.019 --> 00:02:51.949 
water coming back in looks like the
rooster<00:02:49.230> tail<00:02:49.440> behind<00:02:49.950> a<00:02:50.040> jet<00:02:50.250> ski<00:02:50.750> ok<00:02:51.750> well

00:02:51.949 --> 00:02:51.959 
rooster tail behind a jet ski ok well

00:02:51.959 --> 00:02:53.240 
rooster tail behind a jet ski ok well
what<00:02:52.080> that<00:02:52.200> means<00:02:52.260> is<00:02:52.650> water<00:02:52.920> is<00:02:53.099> coming

00:02:53.240 --> 00:02:53.250 
what that means is water is coming

00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:55.250 
what that means is water is coming
through<00:02:53.489> very<00:02:53.579> well<00:02:53.849> the<00:02:54.660> problem<00:02:55.110> is

00:02:55.250 --> 00:02:55.260 
through very well the problem is

00:02:55.260 --> 00:02:58.339 
through very well the problem is
sometimes<00:02:55.739> these<00:02:56.220> skimmers<00:02:56.720> cannot<00:02:57.720> process

00:02:58.339 --> 00:02:58.349 
sometimes these skimmers cannot process

00:02:58.349 --> 00:03:01.880 
sometimes these skimmers cannot process
as<00:02:58.560> much<00:02:58.769> water<00:02:59.130> as<00:02:59.459> that<00:03:00.090> pump<00:03:00.450> once<00:03:00.890> well

00:03:01.880 --> 00:03:01.890 
as much water as that pump once well

00:03:01.890 --> 00:03:04.460 
as much water as that pump once well
when<00:03:02.040> that<00:03:02.160> happens<00:03:02.700> inside<00:03:03.150> of<00:03:03.930> that<00:03:04.049> skimmer

00:03:04.460 --> 00:03:04.470 
when that happens inside of that skimmer

00:03:04.470 --> 00:03:07.490 
when that happens inside of that skimmer
a<00:03:04.709> little<00:03:05.310> whirlpool<00:03:05.579> will<00:03:06.090> form<00:03:06.450> and<00:03:07.349> what

00:03:07.490 --> 00:03:07.500 
a little whirlpool will form and what

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:10.039 
a little whirlpool will form and what
happens<00:03:07.920> to<00:03:08.010> that<00:03:08.130> little<00:03:08.370> whirlpool<00:03:09.060> is<00:03:09.329> it

00:03:10.039 --> 00:03:10.049 
happens to that little whirlpool is it

00:03:10.049 --> 00:03:12.620 
happens to that little whirlpool is it
will<00:03:10.200> start<00:03:10.530> sucking<00:03:10.920> air<00:03:11.340> you<00:03:12.299> know<00:03:12.390> just

00:03:12.620 --> 00:03:12.630 
will start sucking air you know just

00:03:12.630 --> 00:03:15.500 
will start sucking air you know just
like<00:03:12.720> it's<00:03:12.930> a<00:03:13.049> miniature<00:03:13.890> tornado<00:03:14.370> made<00:03:15.329> out

00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:15.510 
like it's a miniature tornado made out

00:03:15.510 --> 00:03:18.020 
like it's a miniature tornado made out
of<00:03:15.630> water<00:03:15.870> and<00:03:16.170> that<00:03:16.560> tornado<00:03:17.190> will<00:03:17.489> suck<00:03:17.790> air

00:03:18.020 --> 00:03:18.030 
of water and that tornado will suck air

00:03:18.030 --> 00:03:20.420 
of water and that tornado will suck air
and<00:03:18.569> it'll<00:03:18.780> suck<00:03:19.019> air<00:03:19.290> all<00:03:19.560> the<00:03:19.620> way<00:03:19.889> down<00:03:20.190> to

00:03:20.420 --> 00:03:20.430 
and it'll suck air all the way down to

00:03:20.430 --> 00:03:23.240 
and it'll suck air all the way down to
the<00:03:20.549> pump<00:03:20.910> well<00:03:21.840> when<00:03:21.989> the<00:03:22.079> pump<00:03:22.380> gets<00:03:22.680> air<00:03:22.889> in

00:03:23.240 --> 00:03:23.250 
the pump well when the pump gets air in

00:03:23.250 --> 00:03:26.360 
the pump well when the pump gets air in
it<00:03:23.400> it's<00:03:23.970> called<00:03:24.389> losing<00:03:25.019> Prime<00:03:25.440> and<00:03:26.250> what

00:03:26.360 --> 00:03:26.370 
it it's called losing Prime and what

00:03:26.370 --> 00:03:28.099 
it it's called losing Prime and what
will<00:03:26.489> happen<00:03:26.639> is<00:03:27.000> the<00:03:27.209> pump<00:03:27.450> just<00:03:27.540> simply

00:03:28.099 --> 00:03:28.109 
will happen is the pump just simply

00:03:28.109 --> 00:03:30.500 
will happen is the pump just simply
stops<00:03:28.410> pumping<00:03:28.650> it<00:03:29.430> has<00:03:29.639> a<00:03:29.670> little<00:03:29.910> air<00:03:30.180> in<00:03:30.209> it

00:03:30.500 --> 00:03:30.510 
stops pumping it has a little air in it

00:03:30.510 --> 00:03:33.289 
stops pumping it has a little air in it
it<00:03:30.720> just<00:03:31.290> stops<00:03:31.530> pumping<00:03:31.799> so<00:03:32.639> what<00:03:33.209> will

00:03:33.289 --> 00:03:33.299 
it just stops pumping so what will

00:03:33.299 --> 00:03:34.819 
it just stops pumping so what will
happen<00:03:33.329> is<00:03:33.750> you'll<00:03:33.900> think<00:03:34.019> oh<00:03:34.170> my<00:03:34.380> pumps<00:03:34.680> not

00:03:34.819 --> 00:03:34.829 
happen is you'll think oh my pumps not

00:03:34.829 --> 00:03:37.099 
happen is you'll think oh my pumps not
working<00:03:35.220> it's<00:03:35.340> plugged<00:03:35.670> in<00:03:35.940> it's<00:03:36.209> running<00:03:36.630> but

00:03:37.099 --> 00:03:37.109

skimmer what will happen is now is that

00:04:24.810 --> 00:04:27.500 
skimmer what will happen is now is that

vortex of that whirlpool and that won't

00:04:30.650 --> 00:04:32.800 
vortex of that whirlpool and that won't
let<00:04:30.830> the<00:04:31.010> air<00:04:31.190> get<00:04:31.610> pulled<00:04:31.910> down<00:04:32.180> into<00:04:32.480> the

let the air get pulled down into the

00:04:32.810 --> 00:04:35.230 
let the air get pulled down into the
pump<00:04:33.050> so<00:04:33.800> that<00:04:33.980> will<00:04:34.130> allow<00:04:34.400> you<00:04:34.460> as<00:04:34.880> you're

00:04:35.230 --> 00:04:35.240

circulating<00:04:38.900> without<00:04:39.770> losing<00:04:40.220> prime<00:04:40.520> so<00:04:41.180> just

00:04:41.560 --> 00:04:41.570 
circulating without losing prime so just

00:04:41.570 --> 00:04:43.150 
circulating without losing prime so just
