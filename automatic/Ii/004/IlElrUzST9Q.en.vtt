window<00:01:46.770> the<00:01:46.890> I<00:01:47.210> just<00:01:48.210> thought<00:01:48.270> I<00:01:48.360> had<00:01:48.510> a<00:01:48.540> little

00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:48.630 
window the I just thought I had a little

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:51.020 
window the I just thought I had a little
more<00:01:48.780> control<00:01:49.140> of<00:01:49.260> it<00:01:49.620> I<00:01:49.830> do<00:01:50.190> one<00:01:50.520> long<00:01:50.729> line<00:01:50.970> I

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:51.030 
more control of it I do one long line I

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:54.590 
more control of it I do one long line I
tend<00:01:51.420> to<00:01:51.979> not<00:01:52.979> get<00:01:53.250> such<00:01:53.460> a<00:01:53.490> great<00:01:53.729> line<00:01:54.090> and<00:01:54.540> I

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:54.600 
tend to not get such a great line and I

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:56.270 
tend to not get such a great line and I
think<00:01:54.810> it's<00:01:54.930> more<00:01:54.990> because<00:01:55.200> my<00:01:55.440> shaky<00:01:55.710> hand<00:01:56.010> or

00:01:56.270 --> 00:01:56.280 
think it's more because my shaky hand or

00:01:56.280 --> 00:02:00.620 
think it's more because my shaky hand or
just<00:01:58.670> just<00:01:59.670> have<00:01:59.790> better<00:01:59.940> ease<00:02:00.210> with<00:02:00.390> kind<00:02:00.570> of

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:00.630 
just just have better ease with kind of

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:02.870 
just just have better ease with kind of
splitting<00:02:00.930> off<00:02:01.110> the<00:02:01.290> duty<00:02:01.590> so<00:02:02.430> start<00:02:02.670> with<00:02:02.790> the

00:02:02.870 --> 00:02:02.880 
splitting off the duty so start with the

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:14.450 
splitting off the duty so start with the

00:02:14.450 --> 00:02:14.460 

00:02:14.460 --> 00:02:19.580 

very<00:02:15.120> close<00:02:15.450> to<00:02:15.780> the<00:02:15.870> lashes<00:02:18.140> so<00:02:19.140> that's<00:02:19.350> good

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:19.590 
very close to the lashes so that's good

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:21.890 
very close to the lashes so that's good
at<00:02:19.860> half<00:02:20.300> then<00:02:21.300> I'm<00:02:21.390> going<00:02:21.510> to<00:02:21.540> go<00:02:21.630> in<00:02:21.780> the

at half then I'm going to go in the

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:41.910 
at half then I'm going to go in the
inside<00:02:22.290> make<00:02:23.280> sure<00:02:23.310> I<00:02:23.520> can<00:02:23.730> get

00:02:41.910 --> 00:02:41.920

00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:44.730 
so this would be reps a thin black line

00:02:44.730 --> 00:02:47.790 
so this would be reps a thin black line
