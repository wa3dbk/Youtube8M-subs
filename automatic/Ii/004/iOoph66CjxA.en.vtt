love<00:00:20.160> talking<00:00:20.490> about<00:00:20.789> bacteria<00:00:21.060> brand<00:00:21.930> it's

00:00:22.189 --> 00:00:22.199 
love talking about bacteria brand it's

00:00:22.199 --> 00:00:23.689 
love talking about bacteria brand it's
one<00:00:22.350> of<00:00:22.439> the<00:00:22.500> best<00:00:22.859> things<00:00:23.130> about<00:00:23.310> crop

00:00:23.689 --> 00:00:23.699 
one of the best things about crop

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:25.790 
one of the best things about crop
production<00:00:24.240> well<00:00:24.420> as<00:00:24.600> I<00:00:25.109> seem<00:00:25.320> to<00:00:25.380> recall<00:00:25.590> I

00:00:25.790 --> 00:00:25.800 
production well as I seem to recall I

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:28.490 
production well as I seem to recall I
used<00:00:26.070> to<00:00:26.250> grow<00:00:26.609> a<00:00:26.670> lot<00:00:26.910> of<00:00:27.029> molds<00:00:27.510> and<00:00:27.630> fungi<00:00:28.199> in

00:00:28.490 --> 00:00:28.500 
used to grow a lot of molds and fungi in

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:31.160 
used to grow a lot of molds and fungi in
the<00:00:28.710> refrigerator<00:00:29.699> but<00:00:29.910> that<00:00:30.720> was<00:00:30.810> before<00:00:30.929> I

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:31.170 
the refrigerator but that was before I

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:33.049 
the refrigerator but that was before I
got<00:00:31.289> married<00:00:31.650> ran<00:00:32.040> out<00:00:32.250> now<00:00:32.489> my<00:00:32.669> wife<00:00:32.820> would

00:00:33.049 --> 00:00:33.059 
got married ran out now my wife would

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:35.510 
got married ran out now my wife would
never<00:00:33.239> allow<00:00:33.690> that<00:00:33.750> but<00:00:34.290> one<00:00:34.980> place<00:00:35.250> where

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:35.520 
never allow that but one place where

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:38.180 
never allow that but one place where
fungicide<00:00:36.059> your<00:00:36.360> where<00:00:36.960> bacteria<00:00:37.559> use<00:00:37.920> is

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:38.190 
fungicide your where bacteria use is

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:40.639 
fungicide your where bacteria use is
encouraged<00:00:39.030> is<00:00:39.270> on<00:00:39.600> our<00:00:39.719> soybean<00:00:40.110> crop<00:00:40.379> you

00:00:40.639 --> 00:00:40.649 
encouraged is on our soybean crop you

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:42.470 
encouraged is on our soybean crop you
have<00:00:40.860> to<00:00:41.040> use<00:00:41.219> some<00:00:41.430> inoculant<00:00:42.030> out<00:00:42.180> there<00:00:42.360> and

00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:42.480 
have to use some inoculant out there and

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:45.020 
have to use some inoculant out there and
what<00:00:42.570> inoculum<00:00:43.200> is<00:00:43.410> is<00:00:43.649> its<00:00:44.040> Rhizobium

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:45.030 
what inoculum is is its Rhizobium

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:47.060 
what inoculum is is its Rhizobium
bacteria<00:00:45.059> it's<00:00:45.989> kind<00:00:46.200> of<00:00:46.230> a<00:00:46.320> strange<00:00:46.559> thing<00:00:46.890> so

00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:47.070 
bacteria it's kind of a strange thing so

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:48.590 
bacteria it's kind of a strange thing so
if<00:00:47.160> you're<00:00:47.280> a<00:00:47.309> non<00:00:47.550> farmer<00:00:48.059> you<00:00:48.210> might<00:00:48.390> wonder

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:48.600 
if you're a non farmer you might wonder

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:50.720 
if you're a non farmer you might wonder
what<00:00:48.899> in<00:00:49.170> the<00:00:49.379> world<00:00:49.770> are<00:00:50.070> these<00:00:50.190> guys<00:00:50.430> talking

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:50.730 
what in the world are these guys talking

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:53.330 
what in the world are these guys talking
about<00:00:51.000> well<00:00:51.420> there's<00:00:51.750> actually<00:00:51.960> a<00:00:52.340> beneficial

00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:53.340 
about well there's actually a beneficial

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:55.340 
about well there's actually a beneficial
bacteria<00:00:53.550> it's<00:00:54.270> called<00:00:54.510> this<00:00:54.690> Rhizobium

00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:55.350 
bacteria it's called this Rhizobium

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:57.410 
bacteria it's called this Rhizobium
bacteria<00:00:55.379> like<00:00:56.010> Darren<00:00:56.309> said<00:00:56.520> and<00:00:56.699> what<00:00:57.329> it

00:00:57.410 --> 00:00:57.420 
bacteria like Darren said and what it

00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:00.229 
bacteria like Darren said and what it
does<00:00:57.690> is<00:00:58.140> it<00:00:58.469> pulls<00:00:58.949> nitrogen<00:00:59.730> out<00:00:59.850> of<00:00:59.940> the<00:01:00.149> air

00:01:00.229 --> 00:01:00.239 
does is it pulls nitrogen out of the air

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:02.689 
does is it pulls nitrogen out of the air
and<00:01:00.750> converts<00:01:01.500> it<00:01:01.680> into<00:01:01.770> a<00:01:01.980> form<00:01:02.309> the<00:01:02.489> plant

00:01:02.689 --> 00:01:02.699 
and converts it into a form the plant

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:04.369 
and converts it into a form the plant
can<00:01:02.910> use<00:01:02.940> now<00:01:03.420> don't<00:01:03.629> think<00:01:03.840> that<00:01:03.960> the

00:01:04.369 --> 00:01:04.379 
can use now don't think that the

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:06.260 
can use now don't think that the
bacteria<00:01:04.890> are<00:01:04.949> just<00:01:05.189> doing<00:01:05.400> this<00:01:05.640> for<00:01:05.909> fun

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:06.270 
bacteria are just doing this for fun

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:08.390 
bacteria are just doing this for fun
because<00:01:06.840> they<00:01:07.080> love<00:01:07.350> soybean<00:01:07.799> plants<00:01:08.159> they're

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:08.400 
because they love soybean plants they're

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:10.010 
because they love soybean plants they're
doing<00:01:08.820> it<00:01:08.909> because<00:01:09.030> the<00:01:09.330> soybean<00:01:09.689> plants

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:10.020 
doing it because the soybean plants

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:12.740 
doing it because the soybean plants
actually<00:01:10.470> feed<00:01:10.830> the<00:01:10.860> bacteria<00:01:11.420> soybean<00:01:12.420> roots

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:12.750 
actually feed the bacteria soybean roots

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:15.350 
actually feed the bacteria soybean roots
will<00:01:13.020> excrete<00:01:13.409> sugars<00:01:14.369> into<00:01:14.670> the<00:01:14.850> soil<00:01:15.119> the

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:15.360 
will excrete sugars into the soil the

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:18.109 
will excrete sugars into the soil the
bacteria<00:01:16.080> love<00:01:16.320> to<00:01:16.439> eat<00:01:16.590> those<00:01:16.860> sugars<00:01:17.310> and<00:01:17.520> in

00:01:18.109 --> 00:01:18.119 
bacteria love to eat those sugars and in

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:19.910 
bacteria love to eat those sugars and in
exchange<00:01:18.390> the<00:01:18.869> bacteria<00:01:19.380> convert<00:01:19.619> that

00:01:19.910 --> 00:01:19.920 
exchange the bacteria convert that

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:20.990 
exchange the bacteria convert that
nitrogen<00:01:20.250> for<00:01:20.520> the<00:01:20.549> plant

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:21.000 
nitrogen for the plant

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:22.340 
nitrogen for the plant
that's<00:01:21.180> called<00:01:21.420> a<00:01:21.570> symbiotic<00:01:22.049> relationship

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:22.350 
that's called a symbiotic relationship

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:24.320 
that's called a symbiotic relationship
and<00:01:23.100> the<00:01:23.220> other<00:01:23.400> thing<00:01:23.640> that<00:01:23.670> I<00:01:23.790> really<00:01:23.880> like

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:24.330 
and the other thing that I really like

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:26.899 
and the other thing that I really like
about<00:01:24.360> this<00:01:24.750> is<00:01:24.990> rhizobia<00:01:25.470> bacteria<00:01:26.220> is<00:01:26.369> cheap

00:01:26.899 --> 00:01:26.909 
about this is rhizobia bacteria is cheap

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:29.390 
about this is rhizobia bacteria is cheap
and<00:01:27.210> it<00:01:27.450> works<00:01:27.720> really<00:01:28.110> well<00:01:28.229> it<00:01:28.740> only<00:01:28.860> costs

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:29.400 
and it works really well it only costs

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:31.609 
and it works really well it only costs
typically<00:01:29.850> a<00:01:29.880> buck<00:01:30.270> or<00:01:30.479> two<00:01:30.659> depending<00:01:30.869> on

00:01:31.609 --> 00:01:31.619 
typically a buck or two depending on

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:34.420 
typically a buck or two depending on
hold<00:01:32.070> on<00:01:32.310> I<00:01:32.610> thought<00:01:32.790> there<00:01:33.060> were<00:01:33.240> normally

00:01:34.420 --> 00:01:34.430 
hold on I thought there were normally

00:01:34.430 --> 00:01:36.830 
hold on I thought there were normally
naturally<00:01:35.430> found<00:01:35.700> bacteria<00:01:36.150> in<00:01:36.570> the<00:01:36.689> soil

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:36.840 
naturally found bacteria in the soil

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:39.260 
naturally found bacteria in the soil
sought<00:01:37.530> to<00:01:37.680> Rhizobium<00:01:38.280> bacteria<00:01:38.310> so<00:01:38.939> you've

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:39.270 
sought to Rhizobium bacteria so you've

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:40.910 
sought to Rhizobium bacteria so you've
been<00:01:39.390> raising<00:01:39.600> soybeans<00:01:40.170> underground<00:01:40.680> for

00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:40.920 
been raising soybeans underground for

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:43.039 
been raising soybeans underground for
years<00:01:41.189> you've<00:01:41.729> got<00:01:42.000> some<00:01:42.210> natural<00:01:42.390> rhizobia

00:01:43.039 --> 00:01:43.049 
years you've got some natural rhizobia

00:01:43.049 --> 00:01:45.590 
years you've got some natural rhizobia
bacteria<00:01:43.710> the<00:01:43.829> problem<00:01:44.310> is<00:01:44.490> is<00:01:44.670> the<00:01:45.180> ones<00:01:45.360> that

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:45.600 
bacteria the problem is is the ones that

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:47.810 
bacteria the problem is is the ones that
are<00:01:45.720> tough<00:01:46.020> enough<00:01:46.200> to<00:01:46.890> survive<00:01:47.250> with<00:01:47.520> all<00:01:47.670> the

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:47.820 
are tough enough to survive with all the

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:49.580 
are tough enough to survive with all the
other<00:01:47.939> bacteria<00:01:48.479> in<00:01:48.540> your<00:01:48.659> soil<00:01:48.899> aren't

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:49.590 
other bacteria in your soil aren't

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:50.990 
other bacteria in your soil aren't
necessarily<00:01:50.130> the<00:01:50.369> ones<00:01:50.399> that<00:01:50.759> are<00:01:50.850> most

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:51.000 
necessarily the ones that are most

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:52.850 
necessarily the ones that are most
efficient<00:01:51.600> at<00:01:51.750> producing<00:01:51.869> nitrogen<00:01:52.320> for<00:01:52.770> your

efficient at producing nitrogen for your

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:55.069 
efficient at producing nitrogen for your
plant<00:01:53.130> so<00:01:53.399> you<00:01:53.460> can<00:01:53.670> apply<00:01:53.970> the<00:01:54.360> efficient

00:01:55.069 --> 00:01:55.079 
plant so you can apply the efficient

00:01:55.079 --> 00:01:57.350 
plant so you can apply the efficient
strains<00:01:55.530> of<00:01:55.799> rhizobia<00:01:56.219> bacteria<00:01:56.880> for<00:01:57.149> only<00:01:57.329> a

00:01:57.350 --> 00:01:57.360 
strains of rhizobia bacteria for only a

00:01:57.360 --> 00:01:59.270 
strains of rhizobia bacteria for only a
dollar<00:01:57.689> or<00:01:58.020> two<00:01:58.049> an<00:01:58.320> acre<00:01:58.469> it's<00:01:58.740> really<00:01:59.070> not<00:01:59.219> a

00:01:59.270 --> 00:01:59.280 
dollar or two an acre it's really not a

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:01.039 
dollar or two an acre it's really not a
big<00:01:59.490> expense<00:01:59.969> and<00:02:00.240> it<00:02:00.360> only<00:02:00.479> takes<00:02:00.750> about<00:02:00.869> a

00:02:01.039 --> 00:02:01.049 
big expense and it only takes about a

00:02:01.049 --> 00:02:03.200 
big expense and it only takes about a
quarter<00:02:01.500> of<00:02:01.619> a<00:02:01.710> bushel<00:02:02.070> or<00:02:02.219> maybe<00:02:02.399> less<00:02:02.759> to

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:03.210 
quarter of a bushel or maybe less to

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:05.389 
quarter of a bushel or maybe less to
justify<00:02:03.750> the<00:02:03.810> cost<00:02:04.079> and<00:02:04.530> on<00:02:04.770> our<00:02:04.890> farm<00:02:05.189> we've

00:02:05.389 --> 00:02:05.399 
justify the cost and on our farm we've

00:02:05.399 --> 00:02:07.969 
justify the cost and on our farm we've
we've<00:02:05.729> typically<00:02:06.210> gotten<00:02:06.689> a<00:02:06.810> bushel<00:02:07.380> or<00:02:07.530> more

00:02:07.969 --> 00:02:07.979 
we've typically gotten a bushel or more

00:02:07.979 --> 00:02:10.070 
we've typically gotten a bushel or more
gain<00:02:08.489> using<00:02:09.090> an<00:02:09.330> Acula<00:02:09.690> so<00:02:09.810> it's<00:02:09.929> been<00:02:10.050> a

00:02:10.070 --> 00:02:10.080 
gain using an Acula so it's been a

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:11.210 
gain using an Acula so it's been a
really<00:02:10.229> good<00:02:10.440> return<00:02:10.590> yeah

00:02:11.210 --> 00:02:11.220 
really good return yeah

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:13.670 
really good return yeah
so<00:02:11.400> this<00:02:11.640> isn't<00:02:11.819> some<00:02:12.180> enormous<00:02:12.870> deal

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:13.680 
so this isn't some enormous deal

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:16.009 
so this isn't some enormous deal
where<00:02:13.890> a<00:02:14.189> farmer<00:02:14.489> will<00:02:14.849> you<00:02:15.030> say<00:02:15.269> oh<00:02:15.540> I'm<00:02:15.840> gonna

00:02:16.009 --> 00:02:16.019 
where a farmer will you say oh I'm gonna

00:02:16.019 --> 00:02:17.869 
where a farmer will you say oh I'm gonna
invest<00:02:16.409> a<00:02:16.530> dollar<00:02:16.709> and<00:02:17.129> I'm<00:02:17.219> gonna<00:02:17.370> get<00:02:17.549> five

00:02:17.869 --> 00:02:17.879 
invest a dollar and I'm gonna get five

00:02:17.879 --> 00:02:19.819 
invest a dollar and I'm gonna get five
hundred<00:02:18.150> back<00:02:18.569> or<00:02:18.870> anything<00:02:19.049> like<00:02:19.349> that<00:02:19.409> but

00:02:19.819 --> 00:02:19.829 
hundred back or anything like that but

00:02:19.829 --> 00:02:21.470 
hundred back or anything like that but
if<00:02:19.950> the<00:02:20.040> farmer<00:02:20.310> invested<00:02:20.700> dollar<00:02:20.909> and<00:02:21.269> he

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:21.480 
if the farmer invested dollar and he

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:22.789 
if the farmer invested dollar and he
gets<00:02:21.659> ten<00:02:21.930> to<00:02:22.049> twenty<00:02:22.349> back

00:02:22.789 --> 00:02:22.799 
gets ten to twenty back

00:02:22.799 --> 00:02:25.099 
gets ten to twenty back
that's<00:02:23.010> an<00:02:23.250> enormous<00:02:24.150> return<00:02:24.390> on<00:02:24.659> investment

00:02:25.099 --> 00:02:25.109 
that's an enormous return on investment

00:02:25.109 --> 00:02:26.899 
that's an enormous return on investment
it's<00:02:25.290> fine<00:02:25.620> I<00:02:25.769> wish<00:02:26.129> I<00:02:26.250> could<00:02:26.400> send<00:02:26.579> money<00:02:26.790> to

00:02:26.899 --> 00:02:26.909 
it's fine I wish I could send money to

00:02:26.909 --> 00:02:28.729 
it's fine I wish I could send money to
York<00:02:27.480> and<00:02:27.719> get<00:02:27.840> the<00:02:27.959> same<00:02:28.170> thing<00:02:28.409> out<00:02:28.500> of<00:02:28.560> the

00:02:28.729 --> 00:02:28.739 
York and get the same thing out of the

00:02:28.739 --> 00:02:30.619 
York and get the same thing out of the
stock<00:02:28.950> market<00:02:28.980> that'd<00:02:29.459> be<00:02:29.579> great<00:02:29.819> but<00:02:30.060> anyway

00:02:30.619 --> 00:02:30.629 
stock market that'd be great but anyway

00:02:30.629 --> 00:02:33.649 
stock market that'd be great but anyway

bacteria that we're putting out there
but<00:02:53.459> that<00:02:53.609> usually<00:02:53.909> doesn't<00:02:54.480> happen<00:02:54.689> to<00:02:55.169> a

but that usually doesn't happen to a

but that usually doesn't happen to a
great<00:02:55.470> degree<00:02:55.650> so<00:02:56.040> generally<00:02:56.519> when<00:02:56.639> a<00:02:56.669> farmer

00:02:56.869 --> 00:02:56.879 
great degree so generally when a farmer

00:02:56.879 --> 00:02:58.580 
great degree so generally when a farmer

puts inoculant on his seed those
bacteria<00:02:59.159> do<00:02:59.310> some<00:02:59.519> good<00:02:59.700> and<00:02:59.909> they'll<00:03:00.120> gain

00:03:00.349 --> 00:03:00.359 
bacteria do some good and they'll gain

00:03:00.359 --> 00:03:02.330 
bacteria do some good and they'll gain
him<00:03:00.569> 1<00:03:00.810> to<00:03:00.959> 2<00:03:01.139> bushels<00:03:01.560> now<00:03:01.829> in<00:03:02.099> some<00:03:02.310> cases

00:03:02.330 --> 00:03:02.340 
him 1 to 2 bushels now in some cases

5<00:03:06.689> to<00:03:06.930> 10<00:03:07.139> bushels<00:03:07.409> that's<00:03:07.829> a<00:03:08.040> really<00:03:08.310> big<00:03:08.430> deal

00:03:08.629 --> 00:03:08.639 
5 to 10 bushels that's a really big deal

00:03:08.639 --> 00:03:10.159 
5 to 10 bushels that's a really big deal
well<00:03:09.030> here's<00:03:09.209> the<00:03:09.359> other<00:03:09.450> side<00:03:09.719> of<00:03:09.900> it<00:03:09.989> too

00:03:10.159 --> 00:03:10.169 
well here's the other side of it too

00:03:10.169 --> 00:03:12.259 
well here's the other side of it too
we're<00:03:10.349> talking<00:03:10.650> about<00:03:10.709> live<00:03:11.189> bacteria<00:03:12.150> that

00:03:12.259 --> 00:03:12.269 
we're talking about live bacteria that

00:03:12.269 --> 00:03:14.179 
we're talking about live bacteria that
we're<00:03:12.389> putting<00:03:12.540> on<00:03:12.840> to<00:03:13.109> the<00:03:13.260> seed<00:03:13.560> so<00:03:13.919> it's<00:03:14.040> in

00:03:14.179 --> 00:03:14.189 
we're putting on to the seed so it's in

00:03:14.189 --> 00:03:15.860 
we're putting on to the seed so it's in
the<00:03:14.280> right<00:03:14.489> position<00:03:15.090> to<00:03:15.239> be<00:03:15.419> able<00:03:15.510> to<00:03:15.629> work

00:03:15.860 --> 00:03:15.870 
the right position to be able to work

00:03:15.870 --> 00:03:17.930 
the right position to be able to work
with<00:03:16.049> that<00:03:16.290> young<00:03:16.500> seedling<00:03:17.040> to<00:03:17.310> get<00:03:17.519> the<00:03:17.669> most

00:03:17.930 --> 00:03:17.940 
with that young seedling to get the most

00:03:17.940 --> 00:03:19.849 
with that young seedling to get the most
out<00:03:18.239> of<00:03:18.299> your<00:03:18.540> live<00:03:18.840> bacteria<00:03:19.620> that<00:03:19.769> you're

out of your live bacteria that you're
putting<00:03:20.099> on<00:03:20.250> you<00:03:20.519> need<00:03:20.699> to<00:03:20.790> put<00:03:20.970> it<00:03:21.090> on<00:03:21.180> the

putting on you need to put it on the

00:03:21.569 --> 00:03:23.149 
putting on you need to put it on the
seed<00:03:21.810> right<00:03:22.349> before<00:03:22.709> it<00:03:22.769> goes<00:03:22.859> in<00:03:23.010> the<00:03:23.069> ground

00:03:23.149 --> 00:03:23.159 
seed right before it goes in the ground

00:03:23.159 --> 00:03:25.460 
seed right before it goes in the ground
so<00:03:23.579> let's<00:03:23.970> just<00:03:24.209> say<00:03:24.389> that<00:03:24.419> you're<00:03:24.959> planting<00:03:25.229> a

00:03:25.460 --> 00:03:25.470 
so let's just say that you're planting a

00:03:25.470 --> 00:03:28.490 
so let's just say that you're planting a
garden<00:03:25.500> and<00:03:26.190> you've<00:03:26.519> got<00:03:26.790> legume<00:03:27.419> crops<00:03:27.750> like

00:03:28.490 --> 00:03:28.500 
garden and you've got legume crops like

00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:30.020 
garden and you've got legume crops like
a<00:03:28.530> soybean<00:03:28.889> is<00:03:29.220> maybe<00:03:29.430> you've<00:03:29.609> got<00:03:29.790> some

00:03:30.020 --> 00:03:30.030 
a soybean is maybe you've got some

00:03:30.030 --> 00:03:31.729 
a soybean is maybe you've got some
different<00:03:30.329> varieties<00:03:30.419> of<00:03:30.689> peas<00:03:31.109> there<00:03:31.560> are

00:03:31.729 --> 00:03:31.739 
different varieties of peas there are

00:03:31.739 --> 00:03:33.559 
different varieties of peas there are
some<00:03:32.010> inoculants<00:03:32.519> that<00:03:32.699> you<00:03:32.790> could<00:03:33.030> put<00:03:33.299> right

00:03:33.559 --> 00:03:33.569 
some inoculants that you could put right

00:03:33.569 --> 00:03:35.869 
some inoculants that you could put right
on<00:03:33.599> peas<00:03:34.169> you<00:03:34.530> want<00:03:34.829> to<00:03:34.889> put<00:03:35.040> it<00:03:35.129> on<00:03:35.220> directly

00:03:35.869 --> 00:03:35.879 
on peas you want to put it on directly

00:03:35.879 --> 00:03:37.520 
on peas you want to put it on directly
as<00:03:36.090> you're<00:03:36.479> planting<00:03:36.930> that<00:03:37.049> seed

00:03:37.520 --> 00:03:37.530 
as you're planting that seed

00:03:37.530 --> 00:03:39.619 
as you're planting that seed
well<00:03:37.650> once<00:03:37.829> again<00:03:37.979> inoculant<00:03:38.970> is<00:03:39.180> live

00:03:39.619 --> 00:03:39.629 
well once again inoculant is live

00:03:39.629 --> 00:03:42.020 
well once again inoculant is live
bacteria<00:03:40.439> that's<00:03:40.680> actually<00:03:41.129> beneficial<00:03:41.699> to

00:03:42.020 --> 00:03:42.030 
bacteria that's actually beneficial to

00:03:42.030 --> 00:03:43.640 
bacteria that's actually beneficial to
the<00:03:42.150> plant<00:03:42.419> it's<00:03:42.659> an<00:03:42.840> important<00:03:43.319> thing<00:03:43.349> in

00:03:43.640 --> 00:03:43.650
