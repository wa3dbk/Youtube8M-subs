00:00:02.510 --> 00:00:04.350
 about twenty years leg intend 

00:00:04.350 --> 00:00:06.350
 European car is a whole 

00:00:06.350 --> 00:00:07.830
 eternity for the domestic model 

00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:11.020
 this is the process of becoming a vaz 21 09 

00:00:11.020 --> 00:00:13.529
 immortal car 

00:00:13.529 --> 00:00:16.710
 VAZ 21 09 53 on other days 

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:18.689
 three tenths engines 

00:00:18.689 --> 00:00:21.210
 liters and output of 64 horsepower 

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:22.320
 mechanical transmission 

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:24.689
 five-speed maximum 

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:26.500
 speed of 150 kilometers per hour 

00:00:26.500 --> 00:00:28.809
 the car began to be made in the USSR 

00:00:28.809 --> 00:00:32.839
 1987 nine became logical 

00:00:32.839 --> 00:00:35.860
 continuation of 2 21 08 first 

00:00:35.860 --> 00:00:37.879
 domestic car with front 

00:00:37.879 --> 00:00:39.460
 driven and walking body 

00:00:39.460 --> 00:00:41.480
 also to pay new nickname 

00:00:41.480 --> 00:00:44.140
 disgraced he can do it the second model 

00:00:44.140 --> 00:00:46.390
 it became clear to everyone that the country appeared 

00:00:46.390 --> 00:00:47.940
 beat families again 

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:50.430
 Originally the first cars of Samara and the world 

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:52.530
 short front pads plastic 

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:54.480
 muzzle which eventually tied up and 

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:56.940
 repainted yes criticized nine 

00:00:56.940 --> 00:00:58.000
 according to the full program 

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:00.380
 but there were quite a few compliments as well 

00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:01.600
 the distant eighties 

00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:02.760
 no other domestic 

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:04.970
 the car could not boast so 

00:01:04.970 --> 00:01:06.330
 modern design 

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:07.110
 transversely located 

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:09.910
 motor today it looks familiar but 

00:01:09.910 --> 00:01:12.340
 20 years ago it was a revelation for 

00:01:12.340 --> 00:01:13.640
 Soviet motorists 

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:15.430
 front wheel drive feature 

00:01:15.430 --> 00:01:17.380
 vazov preserved to this day 

00:01:17.380 --> 00:01:19.789
 this is unstable engine operation 

00:01:19.789 --> 00:01:21.659
 instead of this nonsense energy absorbing 

00:01:21.659 --> 00:01:24.580
 branch both on foreign cars just 

00:01:24.580 --> 00:01:26.490
 truth unlike cars each 

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:28.450
 part of the cabin lives its own life 

00:01:28.450 --> 00:01:29.960
 squeaky life 

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:30.690
 and what is most surprising 

00:01:30.690 --> 00:01:33.570
 plastic parts are trying to break free 

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:35.280
 captive mounts get out 

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:36.200
 develops 

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:38.170
 further he probably constructed 

00:01:38.170 --> 00:01:40.130
 transferred money and children 

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:42.329
 wide club and hitting gas can 

00:01:42.329 --> 00:01:44.399
 pinch the cultures of Moscow for something 

00:01:44.399 --> 00:01:46.720
 take away from the car is the debt of countries 

00:01:46.720 --> 00:01:48.700
 but only as a start since overclocking 

00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:50.380
 inability nines with motor 

00:01:50.380 --> 00:01:53.250
 one full 55 liters mediocre to 

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:55.150
 need to move dynamically constantly 

00:01:55.150 --> 00:01:57.990
 growing engine on every gear in 

00:01:57.990 --> 00:01:59.940
 most machine arrivals 

00:01:59.940 --> 00:02:01.210
 Kharkov airport 

00:02:01.210 --> 00:02:03.380
 and not even a chorus if you listen 

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:05.860
 car talking to me 

00:02:05.860 --> 00:02:08.060
 the more the speed the louder 

00:02:08.060 --> 00:02:09.740
 lounges accompaniment 

00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:12.210
 CAT work can be called very good 

00:02:12.210 --> 00:02:14.710
 if you close your eyes to the fact that the fifth speed 

00:02:14.710 --> 00:02:16.590
 need only to maintain movement 

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:18.580
 on horizontal plots fourth 

00:02:18.580 --> 00:02:20.720
 too weak to accelerate dynamically 

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:23.620
 but setting the chassis frankly happy 

00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:25.340
 power consumption suspension good 

00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:27.390
 copes with potholes and kidneys 

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:29.160
 true with the speed of the car 

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:30.500
 starts to sway and 

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:32.260
 repeats profile too accurately 

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:34.260
 roadbed but reaction to 

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:36.380
 steering turns fast and accurate what 

00:02:36.380 --> 00:02:38.460
 allows you to confidently move on 

00:02:38.460 --> 00:02:40.199
 trajectories 

00:02:40.199 --> 00:02:45.149
 for 1987, in Baku 21 05 modern and 

00:02:45.149 --> 00:02:46.709
 relevant car 

00:02:46.709 --> 00:02:50.019
 for 2006 this is not bad though 

00:02:50.019 --> 00:02:51.920
 obsolete machine which is a bit 

00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:54.260
 reconciliation and tint eyes like 

00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:55.970
 nor strange still releases
