00:00:11.440 --> 00:00:16.080
 welcome to an android video on 

00:00:14.679 --> 00:00:19.300
 this time I want to share 

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:22.390
 personalization I will show you how 

00:00:19.300 --> 00:00:25.180
 have the modification bar as the 

00:00:22.390 --> 00:00:28.989
 status bar as the quick settings 

00:00:25.180 --> 00:00:29.439
 of the inverted site and furnace or in this 

00:00:28.989 --> 00:00:31.540
 case 

00:00:29.439 --> 00:00:34.180
 iphone now our android device 

00:00:31.540 --> 00:00:36.430
 in this case we are going to need two 

00:00:34.180 --> 00:00:38.410
 applications can also 

00:00:36.430 --> 00:00:40.180
 complemented with a launcher but already 

00:00:38.410 --> 00:00:42.850
 It seems to me to be an exaggeration for me 

00:00:40.180 --> 00:00:45.699
 taste if the first application we're going 

00:00:42.850 --> 00:00:48.460
 to need that payment the application well 

00:00:45.699 --> 00:00:51.510
 I'm going to leave it for you 

00:00:48.460 --> 00:00:54.539
 they can download it's called ay not it 

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:56.990
 to install to me does not mark me any 

00:00:54.539 --> 00:01:00.820
 permission because I have it installed 

00:00:56.990 --> 00:01:03.829
 so we're not going to execute them 

00:01:00.820 --> 00:01:05.239
 notice once done this are the 

00:01:03.829 --> 00:01:06.500
 patients interface with the following 

00:01:05.239 --> 00:01:10.370
 options that we are going to have to activate 

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:13.130
 to begin with let's enable the i'm 

00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:15.260
 not in you see that I have everything 

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:15.979
 it is by default I am with an engine x 10 

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:19.460
 in a generation 

00:01:15.979 --> 00:01:21.890
 I do not have things and so let's give it 

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:23.690
 accessibility permits once done 

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:25.490
 once done this sends us to this 

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:27.200
 series of options have to simply 

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:29.930
 activate the no notify does not ask 

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:32.899
 confirmation we give you back but you 

00:01:29.930 --> 00:01:35.630
 that this application has already changed 

00:01:32.899 --> 00:01:36.380
 it runs before the 8th that comes by 

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:39.060
 default 

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:41.040
 I think it's very good because 

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:43.320
 it worked very well and very apart from that 

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:45.390
 change color with the background style 

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:47.159
 have the application followed in this 

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:50.580
 case on the other hand if I go to my home 

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:52.410
 screen you what 

00:01:50.580 --> 00:01:54.750
 the pre color black and 5 moves to the 

00:01:52.410 --> 00:01:56.780
 facebook then also in the sea 

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:58.490
 blue color 

00:01:56.780 --> 00:02:00.350
 let's see what it is that has the most 

00:01:58.490 --> 00:02:02.420
 let's give it back 

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:04.790
 Here he tells us that he does want us 

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:07.700
 show the signal strength 

00:02:04.790 --> 00:02:10.280
 this is characteristic of surrounding the logo 

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:12.980
 of the iphone that they carry in their icon 

00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:14.270
 the force the signal are a few circles and 

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:16.190
 it seems very good to me I like it 

00:02:14.270 --> 00:02:17.540
 rather not because he asks us yes that we 

00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:21.590
 wants us to show the percentage the 

00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:23.810
 battery the format of the clock and if 

00:02:21.590 --> 00:02:25.370
 we want you to show in the name of 

00:02:23.810 --> 00:02:27.260
 operator and if I want that they can me 

00:02:25.370 --> 00:02:29.360
 put his name and simply on 

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:30.319
 accept and ready because this has been very 

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:32.360
 very well 

00:02:30.319 --> 00:02:35.269
 it's pretty nice enough 

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:37.190
 cool to me I like we can download and 

00:02:35.269 --> 00:02:39.769
 good here shows us the calendar and what 

00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:42.560
 that we have scheduled for the day 

00:02:39.769 --> 00:02:43.819
 next or some event and if we 

00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:45.980
 let's notifications here 

00:02:43.819 --> 00:02:48.080
 also presents itself to us if we in 

00:02:45.980 --> 00:02:50.660
 house had some regrettable action 

00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:52.519
 had an example I slipped for the 

00:02:50.660 --> 00:02:54.530
 left and then I give him who stung him 

00:02:52.519 --> 00:02:55.760
 so that this disappears the 

00:02:54.530 --> 00:02:57.890
 notification or I can also 

00:02:55.760 --> 00:03:00.350
 press there and send me the application 

00:02:57.890 --> 00:03:02.330
 direct not so it does not have bad the 

00:03:00.350 --> 00:03:04.550
 synchronization and it works very well 

00:03:02.330 --> 00:03:07.340
 now the second application that in this 

00:03:04.550 --> 00:03:09.620
 case will be in the quick settings the 

00:03:07.340 --> 00:03:12.370
 application is called control center and that 

00:03:09.620 --> 00:03:15.940
 is guaranteed in new play 

00:03:12.370 --> 00:03:17.680
 visibly we have to give star and 

00:03:15.940 --> 00:03:19.090
 I'm very important this is 

00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:21.459
 configuration that I am going to present is 

00:03:19.090 --> 00:03:23.260
 only to everyone's liking is not a 

00:03:21.459 --> 00:03:27.090
 area in which is less you are 

00:03:23.260 --> 00:03:29.680
 this green as present is the area in 

00:03:27.090 --> 00:03:31.900
 the area that we have pressed 

00:03:29.680 --> 00:03:33.879
 for this application to run like this 

00:03:31.900 --> 00:03:35.049
 that we can put the left side if 

00:03:33.879 --> 00:03:38.230
 they do not feel on the right side 

00:03:35.049 --> 00:03:42.040
 I leave it for me it's a lot 

00:03:38.230 --> 00:03:44.379
 best in the 7 option is to see what 

00:03:42.040 --> 00:03:46.090
 so big is the bar that we 

00:03:44.379 --> 00:03:48.810
 we are executing I leave it there a 

00:03:46.090 --> 00:03:50.920
 recommendation because when in mode 

00:03:48.810 --> 00:03:53.379
 landscape or when in mode 

00:03:50.920 --> 00:03:56.230
 horizontal when you're playing well 

00:03:53.379 --> 00:03:59.200
 lets you press it and this is so that 

00:03:56.230 --> 00:04:00.819
 the bar gets thicker or gets more 

00:03:59.200 --> 00:04:03.310
 thin I leave it there that as they saw 

00:04:00.819 --> 00:04:05.260
 by default you see it seems very good to me not the 

00:04:03.310 --> 00:04:07.659
 indicator if we want to show a 

00:04:05.260 --> 00:04:09.730
 arrow and certain options not if we want 

00:04:07.659 --> 00:04:11.440
 that vibrates with others we select the 

00:04:09.730 --> 00:04:14.770
 We have been 

00:04:11.440 --> 00:04:16.600
 this application because I do not like it once 

00:04:14.770 --> 00:04:20.019
 done this then let me tell you that it is 

00:04:16.600 --> 00:04:22.150
 something complicated for those cell phones 

00:04:20.019 --> 00:04:24.790
 have the navigation buttons 

00:04:22.150 --> 00:04:27.460
 inside the screen so you can 

00:04:24.790 --> 00:04:29.710
 confuse with the google no but yes 

00:04:27.460 --> 00:04:32.020
 that you have to open that you take care of 

00:04:29.710 --> 00:04:33.820
 simply press from and from the 

00:04:32.020 --> 00:04:36.310
 bar 

00:04:33.820 --> 00:04:38.230
 from the application bar not a 

00:04:36.310 --> 00:04:41.310
 little above this allows us a 

00:04:38.230 --> 00:04:41.310
 quick access 

00:04:41.960 --> 00:04:45.570
 whiting everyone in this case 

00:04:44.310 --> 00:04:48.780
 remember that we do not have all 

00:04:45.570 --> 00:04:49.800
 up and we have to do it 

00:04:48.780 --> 00:04:51.830
 from below 

00:04:49.800 --> 00:04:55.280
 We can select to order 

00:04:51.830 --> 00:04:55.280
 increase the brightness 

00:04:56.009 --> 00:05:03.360
 better than we press on the last part 

00:04:58.189 --> 00:05:06.979
 we can order or because the 

00:05:03.360 --> 00:05:06.979
 order of tweets settings 

00:05:11.400 --> 00:05:15.030
 although this does not work well only 

00:05:12.720 --> 00:05:16.889
 that I think that later its lower grade 

00:05:15.030 --> 00:05:17.669
 from the sensitive area that we have to 

00:05:16.889 --> 00:05:19.889
 press 

00:05:17.669 --> 00:05:21.990
 it works very well because there would not be 

00:05:19.889 --> 00:05:23.340
 no error worked very well the brightness 

00:05:21.990 --> 00:05:24.930
 automatic video 

00:05:23.340 --> 00:05:26.100
 we have in this case we will have to 

00:05:24.930 --> 00:05:29.520
 select our product from 

00:05:26.100 --> 00:05:31.650
 reference does not give us a percentage or 

00:05:29.520 --> 00:05:33.840
 some data about how memory 

00:05:31.650 --> 00:05:35.880
 It is the battery and what is the use of 

00:05:33.840 --> 00:05:38.430
 sd card internal neon and obviously the use 

00:05:35.880 --> 00:05:40.220
 of the cpu and also gives us access 

00:05:38.430 --> 00:05:43.490
 Quick 

00:05:40.220 --> 00:05:45.200
 to certain certain applications that 

00:05:43.490 --> 00:05:47.510
 they can be very important to the internal 

00:05:45.200 --> 00:05:49.250
 the clock the alarm the calculator the 

00:05:47.510 --> 00:05:50.780
 camera and the settings we can also 

00:05:49.250 --> 00:05:53.210
 add and also if we give it here 

00:05:50.780 --> 00:05:55.730
 we can order yes that is very good 

00:05:53.210 --> 00:05:58.490
 I like it a lot and for those people 

00:05:55.730 --> 00:06:00.050
 that are very well I liked in the area 

00:05:58.490 --> 00:06:02.120
 of notifications but I did not like what 

00:06:00.050 --> 00:06:04.310
 down that I also have a g-21 is 

00:06:02.120 --> 00:06:06.530
 a guide g3 and then with the bottom 

00:06:04.310 --> 00:06:09.230
 Well, I do not get used to it very well if you 

00:06:06.530 --> 00:06:11.600
 you want it was you 

00:06:09.230 --> 00:06:14.090
 to all the ones of the system then 

00:06:11.600 --> 00:06:16.100
 we have to pull twice and she 

00:06:14.090 --> 00:06:18.670
 you would be on the tops that come 

00:06:16.100 --> 00:06:20.350
 default in this case motorola 

00:06:18.670 --> 00:06:22.450
 then I was in this video I hope 

00:06:20.350 --> 00:06:23.950
 that you liked this 

00:06:22.450 --> 00:06:25.990
 would complement with a video that I already 

00:06:23.950 --> 00:06:29.440
 I have done about it from the keyboard 

00:06:25.990 --> 00:06:30.850
 guys for android I do not know that you guys 

00:06:29.440 --> 00:06:32.410
 they will say someone but because they want 

00:06:30.850 --> 00:06:34.630
 have a child 

00:06:32.410 --> 00:06:37.480
 here but also the mind I liked a lot 

00:06:34.630 --> 00:06:39.250
 and it 's a matter of feeling this not 

00:06:37.480 --> 00:06:40.960
 because androids androids presentation 

00:06:39.250 --> 00:06:43.390
 freedom then with this and you can 

00:06:40.960 --> 00:06:44.980
 give you the pleasure of having part of the 

00:06:43.390 --> 00:06:46.870
 operating system however they do not 

00:06:44.980 --> 00:06:49.360
 can have the pleasure of having android 

00:06:46.870 --> 00:06:52.650
 or its great level of personalization is 

00:06:49.360 --> 00:06:55.150
 well then I leave it with that phrase 

00:06:52.650 --> 00:06:56.110
 it can be up to here this video is the one 

00:06:55.150 --> 00:06:59.550
 from Lima, Peru 

00:06:56.110 --> 00:06:59.550
 Thanks so much for looking
