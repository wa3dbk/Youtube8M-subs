needs<00:02:54.319> a<00:02:54.470> battery<00:02:54.680> replaced<00:02:55.190> so<00:02:55.430> I<00:02:55.790> would<00:02:56.269> say

00:02:56.380 --> 00:02:56.390 
needs a battery replaced so I would say

00:02:56.390 --> 00:02:58.089 
needs a battery replaced so I would say
definitely<00:02:56.540> stock<00:02:57.019> up<00:02:57.170> on<00:02:57.260> batteries<00:02:57.739> if<00:02:57.980> you

00:02:58.089 --> 00:02:58.099 
definitely stock up on batteries if you

00:02:58.099 --> 00:02:59.500 
definitely stock up on batteries if you
can<00:02:58.310> find<00:02:58.489> out<00:02:58.640> the<00:02:58.790> size<00:02:59.000> of<00:02:59.180> batteries

00:02:59.500 --> 00:02:59.510 
can find out the size of batteries

00:02:59.510 --> 00:03:01.960 
can find out the size of batteries
because<00:02:59.690> the<00:03:00.349> watch<00:03:00.530> batteries<00:03:01.099> do<00:03:01.459> die

00:03:01.960 --> 00:03:01.970 
because the watch batteries do die

00:03:01.970 --> 00:03:04.420
