00:00:46.660 --> 00:00:50.810 

yeah<00:00:47.590> parking<00:00:48.100> more

00:00:50.810 --> 00:00:50.820 

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:52.970 

a<00:00:50.850> little<00:00:51.239> bit<00:00:51.390> heavy<00:00:51.660> but<00:00:51.810> it's<00:00:52.530> very<00:00:52.680> very

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:52.980 
a little bit heavy but it's very very

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:54.650 
a little bit heavy but it's very very
strong

00:00:54.650 --> 00:00:54.660 
strong

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:58.569 
strong
a<00:00:54.690> very<00:00:55.079> strong<00:00:55.410> from<00:00:55.739> the<00:00:55.770> supra

00:00:58.569 --> 00:00:58.579 

00:00:58.579 --> 00:01:08.580 

they<00:00:58.760> tried<00:00:59.539> this<00:00:59.870> hard

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:08.590 

00:01:08.590 --> 00:01:10.640 

look<00:01:09.189> at<00:01:09.340> the<00:01:09.460> engine<00:01:09.609> you<00:01:09.880> can

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:10.650 
look at the engine you can

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:14.360 
look at the engine you can
did<00:01:10.860> as<00:01:11.010> far<00:01:11.310> back<00:01:11.580> as<00:01:11.640> we<00:01:12.030> could<00:01:12.230> so<00:01:13.370> number

00:01:14.360 --> 00:01:14.370 
did as far back as we could so number

00:01:14.370 --> 00:01:19.260 
did as far back as we could so number
one<00:01:14.550> cylinder<00:01:14.940> is

00:01:19.260 --> 00:01:19.270 

00:01:19.270 --> 00:01:24.780 

still<00:01:19.750> is<00:01:19.960> a<00:01:19.990> little<00:01:20.380> bit

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:24.790 

00:01:24.790 --> 00:01:28.310 

what<00:01:25.790> happens<00:01:26.120> in<00:01:26.270> the<00:01:26.360> transition<00:01:26.930> is

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:28.320 
what happens in the transition is

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:30.480 
what happens in the transition is
in<00:01:28.409> the<00:01:28.620> fight<00:01:28.800> for<00:01:28.830> this<00:01:29.400> week

00:01:30.480 --> 00:01:30.490 
in the fight for this week

00:01:30.490 --> 00:01:45.580 
in the fight for this week
like<00:01:31.490> this

00:01:45.580 --> 00:01:45.590 

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:48.830 

tradition<00:01:46.590> in<00:01:46.710> the<00:01:46.830> background<00:01:47.220> but<00:01:47.970> this<00:01:48.720> is

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:48.840 
tradition in the background but this is

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:57.169 
tradition in the background but this is
more<00:01:49.080> difficult<00:01:49.580> trick<00:01:50.580> than<00:01:51.420> the<00:01:51.690> Viper

00:01:57.169 --> 00:01:57.179 

00:01:57.179 --> 00:02:03.539 

the<00:01:58.179> driver<00:02:01.109> the<00:02:02.109> driver<00:02:02.259> the<00:02:02.920> Vipers<00:02:03.340> very

00:02:03.539 --> 00:02:03.549 
the driver the driver the Vipers very

00:02:03.549 --> 00:02:05.219 
the driver the driver the Vipers very
balanced<00:02:04.210> and<00:02:04.329> so<00:02:04.509> you<00:02:04.570> have<00:02:04.689> to<00:02:04.990> be<00:02:05.110> going

00:02:05.219 --> 00:02:05.229 
balanced and so you have to be going

00:02:05.229 --> 00:02:09.169 
balanced and so you have to be going
very<00:02:05.350> fast<00:02:05.799> to<00:02:06.520> make<00:02:06.549> it<00:02:06.850> work<00:02:07.110> this<00:02:08.110> one

00:02:09.169 --> 00:02:09.179 
very fast to make it work this one

00:02:09.179 --> 00:02:11.630 
very fast to make it work this one
as<00:02:09.780> a<00:02:09.840> lot<00:02:10.140> of<00:02:10.229> power<00:02:10.409> but<00:02:10.679> not<00:02:10.859> as<00:02:11.009> much<00:02:11.189> torque

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:11.640 
as a lot of power but not as much torque

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:15.340 
as a lot of power but not as much torque
engine<00:02:12.450> so<00:02:12.900> you<00:02:12.959> have<00:02:13.859> to<00:02:13.980> pick<00:02:14.159> the<00:02:14.310> engine

00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:15.350 
engine so you have to pick the engine

00:02:15.350 --> 00:02:21.280 
engine so you have to pick the engine
so<00:02:15.680> you<00:02:15.740> just<00:02:16.010> have<00:02:16.160> to<00:02:19.510> rate<00:02:20.510> the<00:02:20.840> engine<00:02:21.170> is

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:21.290 
so you just have to rate the engine is

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:24.130 
so you just have to rate the engine is
very<00:02:21.320> very<00:02:21.770> high<00:02:22.040> compression<00:02:22.900> 13<00:02:23.900> and<00:02:24.080> a<00:02:24.110> half

00:02:24.130 --> 00:02:24.140 
very very high compression 13 and a half

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:29.710 
very very high compression 13 and a half
to<00:02:24.500> 1<00:02:24.710> compression<00:02:27.190> and<00:02:28.190> it<00:02:28.430> runs<00:02:28.730> at<00:02:28.940> 9,000

00:02:29.710 --> 00:02:29.720 
to 1 compression and it runs at 9,000

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:30.940 
to 1 compression and it runs at 9,000
our

00:02:30.940 --> 00:02:30.950 
our

00:02:30.950 --> 00:02:33.430 
our
so<00:02:31.129> it's<00:02:31.340> a<00:02:31.550> very<00:02:31.819> very<00:02:32.150> high<00:02:32.510> rpm<00:02:32.959> you<00:02:33.110> can<00:02:33.290> we

00:02:33.430 --> 00:02:33.440 
so it's a very very high rpm you can we

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:36.410 
so it's a very very high rpm you can we
can<00:02:33.620> run<00:02:33.800> into<00:02:34.069> almost<00:02:34.430> 10,000<00:02:35.090> hour

00:02:36.410 --> 00:02:36.420 
can run into almost 10,000 hour

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:39.390 
can run into almost 10,000 hour
but<00:02:37.420> it<00:02:37.569> sounds<00:02:37.900> you<00:02:37.960> got<00:02:38.200> a<00:02:38.230> call<00:02:38.470> right<00:02:38.710> it

00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:39.400 
but it sounds you got a call right it

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:42.480 
but it sounds you got a call right it
