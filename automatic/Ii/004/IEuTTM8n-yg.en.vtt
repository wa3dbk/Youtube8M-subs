first thing you need is your image and
I've<00:00:45.390> just<00:00:45.690> chosen<00:00:45.930> this<00:00:46.260> one<00:00:46.320> from<00:00:46.800> the

00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:47.250 
I've just chosen this one from the

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:49.940 
I've just chosen this one from the
newspaper<00:00:48.090> I<00:00:48.420> chose<00:00:49.020> this<00:00:49.170> one<00:00:49.230> because<00:00:49.830> it

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:49.950 
newspaper I chose this one because it

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:52.730 
newspaper I chose this one because it
had<00:00:50.100> nice<00:00:50.280> clear<00:00:50.640> lines<00:00:50.970> in<00:00:51.360> bold<00:00:51.990> colors<00:00:52.440> and

00:00:52.730 --> 00:00:52.740 
had nice clear lines in bold colors and

00:00:52.740 --> 00:00:55.040 
had nice clear lines in bold colors and
I<00:00:53.520> think<00:00:53.850> it<00:00:53.940> will<00:00:54.060> transfer<00:00:54.480> your<00:00:54.540> quite<00:00:54.780> well

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:55.050 
I think it will transfer your quite well

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:57.980 
I think it will transfer your quite well
you<00:00:55.530> need<00:00:55.680> a<00:00:55.710> copy<00:00:55.950> of<00:00:56.160> this<00:00:56.340> in<00:00:56.580> Reverse<00:00:56.990> and

00:00:57.980 --> 00:00:57.990 
you need a copy of this in Reverse and

00:00:57.990 --> 00:01:01.640 
you need a copy of this in Reverse and
you<00:00:58.410> need<00:00:58.620> it<00:00:58.910> done<00:00:59.910> on<00:01:00.210> a<00:01:00.240> laser<00:01:00.570> printer<00:01:01.170> not

00:01:01.640 --> 00:01:01.650 
you need it done on a laser printer not

00:01:01.650 --> 00:01:03.470 
you need it done on a laser printer not
an<00:01:01.800> inkjet<00:01:02.070> printer<00:01:02.280> because<00:01:02.940> it<00:01:03.090> actually<00:01:03.270> it

00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:03.480 
an inkjet printer because it actually it

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:06.140 
an inkjet printer because it actually it
won't<00:01:03.660> work<00:01:03.870> and<00:01:04.580> reverse<00:01:05.580> is<00:01:05.790> especially

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:06.150 
won't work and reverse is especially

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:08.060 
won't work and reverse is especially
important<00:01:06.810> if<00:01:06.900> there's<00:01:07.170> any<00:01:07.350> text<00:01:07.800> involved

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:08.070 
important if there's any text involved

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:10.460 
important if there's any text involved
so<00:01:08.430> I've<00:01:08.520> got<00:01:08.670> my<00:01:08.790> image<00:01:08.940> I<00:01:09.360> need<00:01:09.720> it<00:01:10.020> to<00:01:10.110> be<00:01:10.260> the

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:10.470 
so I've got my image I need it to be the

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:15.460 
so I've got my image I need it to be the
right<00:01:10.860> size<00:01:11.220> for<00:01:11.250> my<00:01:11.610> canvas<00:01:12.710> so<00:01:13.710> I'm<00:01:14.040> going<00:01:14.340> to

00:01:15.460 --> 00:01:15.470 
right size for my canvas so I'm going to

00:01:15.470 --> 00:01:24.170 
right size for my canvas so I'm going to
just<00:01:16.470> quickly<00:01:16.710> draw<00:01:17.040> around<00:01:17.220> there<00:01:22.850> and<00:01:23.850> I

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:24.180 
just quickly draw around there and I

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:26.390 
just quickly draw around there and I
need<00:01:24.360> to<00:01:24.510> cut<00:01:24.720> out<00:01:25.080> anything<00:01:26.070> that<00:01:26.250> I<00:01:26.280> don't

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:26.400 
need to cut out anything that I don't

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:28.700 
need to cut out anything that I don't
want<00:01:26.850> to<00:01:27.060> be<00:01:27.210> in<00:01:27.420> the<00:01:27.600> air<00:01:27.659> so<00:01:27.690> for<00:01:28.080> this<00:01:28.200> one<00:01:28.470> I

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:28.710 
want to be in the air so for this one I

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:30.710 
want to be in the air so for this one I
actually<00:01:28.860> only<00:01:29.340> want<00:01:29.640> the<00:01:29.820> birds<00:01:30.090> I<00:01:30.390> don't

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:30.720 
actually only want the birds I don't

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:35.270 
actually only want the birds I don't
want<00:01:31.340> the<00:01:32.340> ground<00:01:33.200> so<00:01:34.200> you<00:01:34.260> can<00:01:34.650> cut<00:01:34.890> that<00:01:35.070> out

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:35.280 
want the ground so you can cut that out

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:38.060 
want the ground so you can cut that out
and<00:01:36.000> you<00:01:36.210> need<00:01:36.360> to<00:01:36.510> be<00:01:36.659> quite<00:01:36.960> careful<00:01:37.070> cutting

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:38.070 
and you need to be quite careful cutting

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:39.890 
and you need to be quite careful cutting
around<00:01:38.340> the<00:01:38.940> edges<00:01:39.270> because<00:01:39.479> it<00:01:39.600> will<00:01:39.750> get

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:39.900 
around the edges because it will get

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:43.399 
around the edges because it will get
everything<00:01:40.200> so<00:01:41.420> this<00:01:42.420> is<00:01:42.570> a<00:01:42.600> bit<00:01:43.049> of<00:01:43.140> a<00:01:43.200> tricky

00:01:43.399 --> 00:01:43.409 
everything so this is a bit of a tricky

00:01:43.409 --> 00:01:45.710 
everything so this is a bit of a tricky
bit<00:01:43.620> here<00:01:43.920> with<00:01:44.100> the<00:01:44.450> feathers<00:01:45.450> that<00:01:45.479> are

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:45.720 
bit here with the feathers that are

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:48.500 
bit here with the feathers that are
actually<00:01:46.229> probably<00:01:46.500> just<00:01:46.920> tear<00:01:47.250> them<00:01:47.460> so<00:01:48.299> then

00:01:48.500 --> 00:01:48.510 
actually probably just tear them so then

00:01:48.510 --> 00:01:50.289 
actually probably just tear them so then
it<00:01:48.630> gives<00:01:48.780> me<00:01:48.990> a<00:01:49.020> free<00:01:49.200> that<00:01:49.440> edge

00:01:50.289 --> 00:01:50.299 
it gives me a free that edge

00:01:50.299 --> 00:01:53.000 
it gives me a free that edge
okay<00:01:51.299> so<00:01:51.360> now<00:01:51.750> I've<00:01:51.840> got<00:01:51.990> my<00:01:52.080> image<00:01:52.229> I've<00:01:52.860> also

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:53.010 
okay so now I've got my image I've also

00:01:53.010 --> 00:01:55.219 
okay so now I've got my image I've also
cut<00:01:53.370> out<00:01:53.400> the<00:01:53.520> little<00:01:53.760> boobs<00:01:54.120> and<00:01:54.630> bit<00:01:55.080> were

00:01:55.219 --> 00:01:55.229 
cut out the little boobs and bit were

00:01:55.229 --> 00:01:56.660 
cut out the little boobs and bit were
that<00:01:55.620> were<00:01:55.710> just<00:01:55.920> in<00:01:56.040> the<00:01:56.159> corner<00:01:56.460> of<00:01:56.549> the

00:01:56.660 --> 00:01:56.670 
that were just in the corner of the

00:01:56.670 --> 00:01:58.789 
that were just in the corner of the
frame<00:01:56.909> now<00:01:57.450> to<00:01:57.540> get<00:01:57.780> that<00:01:57.900> image<00:01:58.229> onto<00:01:58.590> the

00:01:58.789 --> 00:01:58.799 
frame now to get that image onto the

00:01:58.799 --> 00:02:01.100 
frame now to get that image onto the
canvas<00:01:59.000> you<00:02:00.000> need<00:02:00.150> to<00:02:00.270> prepare<00:02:00.420> your<00:02:00.750> canvas

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:01.110 
canvas you need to prepare your canvas

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:02.450 
canvas you need to prepare your canvas
I've<00:02:01.320> just<00:02:01.500> put<00:02:01.680> a<00:02:01.710> little<00:02:01.860> bit<00:02:01.979> of<00:02:02.070> paint<00:02:02.250> on

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:02.460 
I've just put a little bit of paint on

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:04.430 
I've just put a little bit of paint on
this<00:02:02.610> so<00:02:02.850> that<00:02:03.000> it's<00:02:03.150> not<00:02:03.330> completely<00:02:03.540> white<00:02:04.110> I

00:02:04.430 --> 00:02:04.440 
this so that it's not completely white I

00:02:04.440 --> 00:02:08.629 
this so that it's not completely white I
will<00:02:04.619> paint<00:02:05.220> the<00:02:06.030> gel<00:02:06.690> onto<00:02:07.279> the<00:02:08.279> image<00:02:08.459> and

00:02:08.629 --> 00:02:08.639 
will paint the gel onto the image and

00:02:08.639 --> 00:02:11.330 
will paint the gel onto the image and
I'm<00:02:09.479> going<00:02:09.719> to<00:02:09.810> stick<00:02:10.289> it<00:02:10.409> down<00:02:10.679> onto<00:02:11.069> the

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:11.340 
I'm going to stick it down onto the

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:14.119 
I'm going to stick it down onto the
canvas<00:02:12.230> I'm<00:02:13.230> not<00:02:13.470> going<00:02:13.620> to<00:02:13.680> worry<00:02:13.830> too<00:02:14.099> much

00:02:14.119 --> 00:02:14.129 
canvas I'm not going to worry too much

00:02:14.129 --> 00:02:17.290 
canvas I'm not going to worry too much
about<00:02:14.340> getting<00:02:14.790> gel<00:02:15.450> on<00:02:15.690> my<00:02:15.750> canvas<00:02:16.200> because

00:02:17.290 --> 00:02:17.300 
about getting gel on my canvas because

00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:22.309 
about getting gel on my canvas because
it<00:02:18.300> will<00:02:19.099> dry<00:02:20.099> clear<00:02:20.160> even<00:02:21.090> though<00:02:21.239> it's<00:02:21.629> quite

00:02:22.309 --> 00:02:22.319 
it will dry clear even though it's quite

00:02:22.319 --> 00:02:24.790 
it will dry clear even though it's quite
milky<00:02:23.310> when<00:02:23.489> it's<00:02:23.670> weird

00:02:24.790 --> 00:02:24.800 
milky when it's weird

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:28.130 
milky when it's weird
it'll<00:02:25.800> put<00:02:25.980> a<00:02:26.010> good<00:02:26.310> liberal<00:02:26.550> mount<00:02:27.030> on<00:02:27.300> trying

00:02:28.130 --> 00:02:28.140 
it'll put a good liberal mount on trying

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:31.070 
it'll put a good liberal mount on trying
not<00:02:28.590> to<00:02:28.650> stay<00:02:29.010> too<00:02:29.040> long<00:02:29.700> on<00:02:30.120> any<00:02:30.690> one<00:02:30.870> spot

00:02:31.070 --> 00:02:31.080 
not to stay too long on any one spot

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:32.720 
not to stay too long on any one spot
because<00:02:31.470> it<00:02:31.590> will<00:02:31.709> start<00:02:31.980> to<00:02:32.040> lift<00:02:32.310> it<00:02:32.489> and

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:32.730 
because it will start to lift it and

00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:37.190 
because it will start to lift it and
quite<00:02:33.660> quickly<00:02:33.870> and<00:02:34.709> now<00:02:35.840> we'll<00:02:36.840> stick<00:02:37.080> the

00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:37.200 
quite quickly and now we'll stick the

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:39.740 
quite quickly and now we'll stick the
image<00:02:37.470> down<00:02:37.860> try<00:02:38.819> not<00:02:38.970> to<00:02:39.090> move<00:02:39.239> it<00:02:39.299> around<00:02:39.420> too

00:02:39.740 --> 00:02:39.750 
image down try not to move it around too

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:42.020 
image down try not to move it around too
much<00:02:39.959> fan<00:02:40.319> sets<00:02:40.590> down<00:02:40.890> and<00:02:41.250> you<00:02:41.610> want<00:02:41.700> to<00:02:41.849> try

00:02:42.020 --> 00:02:42.030 
much fan sets down and you want to try

00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:45.199 
much fan sets down and you want to try
and<00:02:42.150> get<00:02:42.269> all<00:02:42.480> the<00:02:42.750> air<00:02:42.930> bubbles<00:02:43.019> out<00:02:43.590> and<00:02:44.220> use

00:02:45.199 --> 00:02:45.209 
and get all the air bubbles out and use

00:02:45.209 --> 00:02:48.020 
and get all the air bubbles out and use
a<00:02:45.239> spoon<00:02:45.720> to<00:02:46.440> get<00:02:46.590> any<00:02:46.829> air<00:02:47.099> bubbles<00:02:47.459> out<00:02:47.700> as

00:02:48.020 --> 00:02:48.030 
a spoon to get any air bubbles out as

00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:50.449 
a spoon to get any air bubbles out as
best<00:02:48.390> you<00:02:48.599> can<00:02:48.630> a<00:02:49.200> roller<00:02:49.739> works<00:02:50.040> quite<00:02:50.430> well

00:02:50.449 --> 00:02:50.459 
best you can a roller works quite well

00:02:50.459 --> 00:02:54.199 
best you can a roller works quite well
for<00:02:50.940> smaller<00:02:51.780> images<00:02:52.470> that<00:02:53.250> are<00:02:53.400> on<00:02:53.519> a<00:02:53.579> harder

00:02:54.199 --> 00:02:54.209 
for smaller images that are on a harder

00:02:54.209 --> 00:02:57.170 
for smaller images that are on a harder
surface<00:02:54.420> like<00:02:54.989> a<00:02:55.019> board<00:02:55.519> okay<00:02:56.519> and<00:02:56.910> so<00:02:57.150> now

00:02:57.170 --> 00:02:57.180 
surface like a board okay and so now

00:02:57.180 --> 00:02:59.569 
surface like a board okay and so now
we'll<00:02:57.480> leave<00:02:57.629> this<00:02:57.780> to<00:02:57.989> dry<00:02:58.200> and<00:02:58.579> it'll

00:02:59.569 --> 00:02:59.579 
we'll leave this to dry and it'll

00:02:59.579 --> 00:03:01.490 
we'll leave this to dry and it'll
probably<00:02:59.760> take<00:03:00.060> it'll<00:03:00.840> probably<00:03:00.989> take<00:03:01.230> a<00:03:01.260> good

00:03:01.490 --> 00:03:01.500 
probably take it'll probably take a good

00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:04.009 
probably take it'll probably take a good
hour<00:03:01.760> it<00:03:02.760> will<00:03:02.940> depend<00:03:03.299> on<00:03:03.420> how<00:03:03.569> big<00:03:03.780> it<00:03:03.900> is<00:03:03.959> how

00:03:04.009 --> 00:03:04.019 
hour it will depend on how big it is how

00:03:04.019 --> 00:03:06.500 
hour it will depend on how big it is how
much<00:03:04.440> Jo<00:03:04.890> you've<00:03:05.099> got<00:03:05.280> on<00:03:05.370> it<00:03:05.549> and<00:03:05.579> how<00:03:06.180> warm<00:03:06.390> it

00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:06.510 
much Jo you've got on it and how warm it

00:03:06.510 --> 00:03:08.809 
much Jo you've got on it and how warm it
is<00:03:06.599> of<00:03:06.870> course<00:03:07.440> but<00:03:07.769> you<00:03:08.340> need<00:03:08.489> to<00:03:08.579> leave<00:03:08.700> it

00:03:08.809 --> 00:03:08.819 
is of course but you need to leave it

00:03:08.819 --> 00:03:11.420 
is of course but you need to leave it
until<00:03:09.000> it's<00:03:09.180> fully<00:03:09.450> dry<00:03:09.780> so<00:03:10.680> this<00:03:10.799> is<00:03:10.980> dry<00:03:11.220> now

00:03:11.420 --> 00:03:11.430 
until it's fully dry so this is dry now

00:03:11.430 --> 00:03:13.699 
until it's fully dry so this is dry now
and<00:03:11.640> it's<00:03:12.209> been<00:03:12.360> about<00:03:12.540> an<00:03:12.720> hour<00:03:12.810> and<00:03:13.500> it's

00:03:13.699 --> 00:03:13.709 
and it's been about an hour and it's

00:03:13.709 --> 00:03:15.470 
and it's been about an hour and it's
ready<00:03:13.920> to<00:03:14.010> rub<00:03:14.250> off<00:03:14.370> it's<00:03:14.940> actually<00:03:15.209> quite<00:03:15.359> an

00:03:15.470 --> 00:03:15.480 
ready to rub off it's actually quite an

00:03:15.480 --> 00:03:19.190 
ready to rub off it's actually quite an
easy<00:03:15.630> process<00:03:15.930> to<00:03:16.139> to<00:03:16.980> get<00:03:17.519> the<00:03:17.609> paper<00:03:17.819> off<00:03:18.200> it

00:03:19.190 --> 00:03:19.200 
easy process to to get the paper off it

00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:20.990 
easy process to to get the paper off it
involves<00:03:19.829> just<00:03:20.040> just<00:03:20.310> water<00:03:20.519> and<00:03:20.880> your

00:03:20.990 --> 00:03:21.000 
involves just just water and your

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:23.150 
involves just just water and your
fingers<00:03:21.359> in<00:03:21.780> so<00:03:22.260> it's<00:03:22.530> a<00:03:22.650> matter<00:03:22.799> of<00:03:22.920> just

00:03:23.150 --> 00:03:23.160 
fingers in so it's a matter of just

00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:24.890 
fingers in so it's a matter of just
dampening<00:03:23.639> the<00:03:23.760> paper<00:03:24.120> and<00:03:24.299> rubbing<00:03:24.690> it<00:03:24.750> off

00:03:24.890 --> 00:03:24.900 
dampening the paper and rubbing it off

00:03:24.900 --> 00:03:26.720 
dampening the paper and rubbing it off
until<00:03:25.290> the<00:03:25.410> paper<00:03:25.620> or<00:03:25.889> rubs<00:03:26.100> off<00:03:26.310> so<00:03:26.549> you<00:03:26.609> can

00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:26.730 
until the paper or rubs off so you can

00:03:26.730 --> 00:03:30.559 
until the paper or rubs off so you can
start<00:03:26.940> off<00:03:27.060> with<00:03:27.209> quite<00:03:27.389> a<00:03:27.420> bit<00:03:27.599> of<00:03:27.690> water<00:03:29.569> just

00:03:30.559 --> 00:03:30.569 
start off with quite a bit of water just

00:03:30.569 --> 00:03:34.910 
start off with quite a bit of water just
get<00:03:30.840> that<00:03:30.959> paper<00:03:31.430> quite<00:03:32.430> saturated<00:03:33.500> and<00:03:34.500> this

00:03:34.910 --> 00:03:34.920 
get that paper quite saturated and this

00:03:34.920 --> 00:03:37.520 
get that paper quite saturated and this
is<00:03:35.130> we<00:03:35.280> you'll<00:03:35.519> discover<00:03:35.989> if<00:03:36.989> there<00:03:37.260> are<00:03:37.349> any

00:03:37.520 --> 00:03:37.530 
is we you'll discover if there are any

00:03:37.530 --> 00:03:40.129 
is we you'll discover if there are any
air<00:03:37.799> bubbles<00:03:38.190> too<00:03:38.750> because<00:03:39.750> they'll<00:03:39.930> leave

00:03:40.129 --> 00:03:40.139 
air bubbles too because they'll leave

00:03:40.139 --> 00:03:41.199 
air bubbles too because they'll leave
little<00:03:40.290> holes

00:03:41.199 --> 00:03:41.209 
little holes

00:03:41.209 --> 00:03:44.960 
little holes
okay<00:03:42.209> so<00:03:42.269> I've<00:03:43.079> rubbed<00:03:43.290> away<00:03:43.530> pretty<00:03:44.519> much<00:03:44.639> all

00:03:44.960 --> 00:03:44.970 
okay so I've rubbed away pretty much all

00:03:44.970 --> 00:03:46.879 
okay so I've rubbed away pretty much all
of<00:03:45.120> the<00:03:45.209> paper<00:03:45.419> you<00:03:45.959> still<00:03:46.319> see<00:03:46.560> there's<00:03:46.799> still

00:03:46.879 --> 00:03:46.889 
of the paper you still see there's still

00:03:46.889 --> 00:03:48.559 
of the paper you still see there's still
a<00:03:47.010> little<00:03:47.190> bit<00:03:47.430> of<00:03:47.519> residue<00:03:47.669> that<00:03:48.090> I<00:03:48.209> can<00:03:48.389> keep

00:03:48.559 --> 00:03:48.569 
a little bit of residue that I can keep

00:03:48.569 --> 00:03:50.420 
a little bit of residue that I can keep
working<00:03:48.989> on<00:03:49.139> the<00:03:49.680> more<00:03:49.889> you<00:03:49.980> rub<00:03:50.160> away<00:03:50.280> the

00:03:50.420 --> 00:03:50.430 
working on the more you rub away the

00:03:50.430 --> 00:03:54.080 
working on the more you rub away the
more<00:03:50.880> chance<00:03:51.630> you<00:03:51.750> have<00:03:52.049> of<00:03:53.090> developing

00:03:54.080 --> 00:03:54.090 
more chance you have of developing

00:03:54.090 --> 00:03:55.879 
more chance you have of developing
little<00:03:54.329> holes<00:03:54.540> in<00:03:54.780> the<00:03:54.810> gel<00:03:55.139> if<00:03:55.620> you<00:03:55.739> can

00:03:55.879 --> 00:03:55.889 
little holes in the gel if you can

00:03:55.889 --> 00:03:59.089 
little holes in the gel if you can
vanish<00:03:56.160> it<00:03:56.579> we<00:03:56.730> can<00:03:56.970> use<00:03:57.269> a<00:03:57.540> bit<00:03:58.139> of<00:03:58.230> fish<00:03:58.620> to

00:03:59.089 --> 00:03:59.099 
vanish it we can use a bit of fish to
