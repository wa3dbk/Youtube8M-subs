00:05:33.030 --> 00:05:34.219 
even it's quicker to play you're going
to<00:05:33.090> be<00:05:33.180> able<00:05:33.270> to<00:05:33.450> get<00:05:33.630> through<00:05:33.930> an<00:05:34.110> entire

00:05:34.219 --> 00:05:34.229 
to be able to get through an entire

00:05:34.229 --> 00:05:36.830 
to be able to get through an entire
quest<00:05:34.950> so<00:05:35.250> two<00:05:35.310> encounters<00:05:36.180> in<00:05:36.419> about<00:05:36.600> two

00:05:36.830 --> 00:05:36.840 
quest so two encounters in about two

00:05:36.840 --> 00:05:38.600 
quest so two encounters in about two
hours<00:05:37.169> which<00:05:37.380> is<00:05:37.530> a<00:05:37.560> big<00:05:37.860> change<00:05:38.280> from<00:05:38.520> the

00:05:38.600 --> 00:05:38.610 
hours which is a big change from the

00:05:38.610 --> 00:05:40.880 
hours which is a big change from the
last<00:05:38.850> version<00:05:39.210> so<00:05:39.870> it's<00:05:40.229> quite<00:05:40.530> simple<00:05:40.830> to

00:05:40.880 --> 00:05:40.890 
last version so it's quite simple to

00:05:40.890 --> 00:05:42.230 
last version so it's quite simple to
learn<00:05:41.100> you're<00:05:41.310> going<00:05:41.430> to<00:05:41.490> end<00:05:41.669> up<00:05:41.850> getting

00:05:42.230 --> 00:05:42.240 
learn you're going to end up getting

00:05:42.240 --> 00:05:43.760 
learn you're going to end up getting
right<00:05:42.570> to<00:05:42.600> the<00:05:42.750> fun<00:05:43.050> right<00:05:43.350> to<00:05:43.470> the<00:05:43.560> meat<00:05:43.740> of

00:05:43.760 --> 00:05:43.770 
right to the fun right to the meat of

00:05:43.770 --> 00:05:45.530 
right to the fun right to the meat of
this<00:05:43.979> game<00:05:44.190> very<00:05:44.550> quickly<00:05:44.880> which<00:05:45.390> you're

00:05:45.530 --> 00:05:45.540 
this game very quickly which you're

00:05:45.540 --> 00:05:47.420 
this game very quickly which you're
really<00:05:45.630> going<00:05:45.840> to<00:05:45.900> like<00:05:46.110> there's<00:05:47.100> always<00:05:47.310> a

00:05:47.420 --> 00:05:47.430 
really going to like there's always a

00:05:47.430 --> 00:05:49.010 
really going to like there's always a
negative<00:05:47.640> though<00:05:47.970> to<00:05:48.030> games<00:05:48.390> like<00:05:48.479> this<00:05:48.720> which

00:05:49.010 --> 00:05:49.020 
negative though to games like this which

00:05:49.020 --> 00:05:52.190 
negative though to games like this which
have<00:05:49.260> one<00:05:49.650> DM<00:05:50.130> character<00:05:50.810> because<00:05:51.810> that<00:05:51.990> means

00:05:52.190 --> 00:05:52.200 
have one DM character because that means

00:05:52.200 --> 00:05:53.570 
have one DM character because that means
that<00:05:52.410> you've<00:05:52.530> got<00:05:52.560> one<00:05:52.860> player<00:05:53.130> that<00:05:53.160> needs<00:05:53.400> to

00:05:53.570 --> 00:05:53.580 
that you've got one player that needs to

00:05:53.580 --> 00:05:55.190 
that you've got one player that needs to
take<00:05:53.760> on<00:05:53.910> that<00:05:54.060> role<00:05:54.300> and<00:05:54.570> be<00:05:54.750> against

00:05:56.840 --> 00:05:56.850 
everybody else at the table so that's

00:05:56.850 --> 00:05:58.550 
everybody else at the table so that's
always<00:05:57.180> a<00:05:57.360> negative<00:05:57.810> for<00:05:57.960> games<00:05:58.140> like<00:05:58.350> this

00:05:58.550 --> 00:05:58.560 
always a negative for games like this

00:05:58.560 --> 00:05:59.870 
always a negative for games like this
there's<00:05:59.040> always<00:05:59.130> going<00:05:59.370> to<00:05:59.400> be<00:05:59.490> somebody<00:05:59.760> who

00:05:59.870 --> 00:05:59.880 
there's always going to be somebody who

00:05:59.880 --> 00:06:01.730 
there's always going to be somebody who

00:06:03.170 --> 00:06:03.180 
somebody who ends up having to do it all

00:06:03.180 --> 00:06:03.920 
somebody who ends up having to do it all
the<00:06:03.450> time

the time

00:06:03.930 --> 00:06:06.650 
the time
however<00:06:04.830> I<00:06:05.070> do<00:06:05.130> think<00:06:05.610> that<00:06:05.700> this<00:06:06.150> second

00:06:06.650 --> 00:06:06.660 
however I do think that this second

00:06:06.660 --> 00:06:08.330 
however I do think that this second
version<00:06:06.810> of<00:06:07.050> descent<00:06:07.380> does<00:06:07.710> a<00:06:07.740> better<00:06:07.979> job<00:06:08.310> of

00:06:08.330 --> 00:06:08.340 
version of descent does a better job of

00:06:08.340 --> 00:06:09.980 
version of descent does a better job of
making<00:06:08.580> the<00:06:08.850> overlords<00:06:09.330> job<00:06:09.630> more

00:06:09.980 --> 00:06:09.990 
making the overlords job more

00:06:09.990 --> 00:06:11.659 
making the overlords job more
interesting<00:06:10.650> and<00:06:10.830> perhaps<00:06:11.070> a<00:06:11.400> little<00:06:11.550> bit

00:06:11.659 --> 00:06:11.669 
interesting and perhaps a little bit

00:06:11.669 --> 00:06:13.730 
interesting and perhaps a little bit
less<00:06:11.790> scripted<00:06:12.630> than<00:06:12.900> it<00:06:13.020> was<00:06:13.169> the<00:06:13.380> first<00:06:13.590> time

00:06:13.730 --> 00:06:13.740 
less scripted than it was the first time

00:06:13.740 --> 00:06:14.180 
less scripted than it was the first time
around

00:06:14.180 --> 00:06:14.190 
around

00:06:14.190 --> 00:06:16.550 
around
another<00:06:14.760> potential<00:06:15.240> drawback<00:06:15.750> of<00:06:15.990> a<00:06:16.350> game

another potential drawback of a game
that's<00:06:16.800> been<00:06:16.979> distilled<00:06:17.490> down<00:06:17.790> like<00:06:18.030> this<00:06:18.240> is

00:06:18.530 --> 00:06:18.540 
that's been distilled down like this is

00:06:18.540 --> 00:06:20.180 
that's been distilled down like this is
that<00:06:18.840> the<00:06:19.050> quests<00:06:19.500> in<00:06:19.650> this<00:06:19.800> version<00:06:20.100> of

00:06:20.180 --> 00:06:20.190 
that the quests in this version of

00:06:20.190 --> 00:06:22.700 
that the quests in this version of
descent<00:06:20.550> feel<00:06:20.820> pretty<00:06:21.419> bite-sized<00:06:21.960> you<00:06:22.590> can

00:06:22.700 --> 00:06:22.710 
descent feel pretty bite-sized you can

00:06:22.710 --> 00:06:24.110 
descent feel pretty bite-sized you can
get<00:06:22.830> through<00:06:22.979> one<00:06:23.070> in<00:06:23.220> only<00:06:23.340> two<00:06:23.580> hours<00:06:23.610> which

00:06:24.110 --> 00:06:24.120 
get through one in only two hours which

00:06:24.120 --> 00:06:26.360 
get through one in only two hours which
is<00:06:24.270> really<00:06:24.780> awesome<00:06:24.960> but<00:06:25.710> if<00:06:25.830> you<00:06:25.950> want<00:06:26.160> to<00:06:26.250> get

00:06:26.360 --> 00:06:26.370 
is really awesome but if you want to get

00:06:26.370 --> 00:06:28.370 
is really awesome but if you want to get

00:06:28.370 --> 00:06:28.380 
that epic adventure game feel then

00:06:28.380 --> 00:06:29.950 
that epic adventure game feel then

you're probably going to want to play

00:06:29.960 --> 00:06:32.320 
you're probably going to want to play
multiple<00:06:30.380> quests<00:06:30.830> or<00:06:30.979> get<00:06:31.789> right<00:06:32.060> into<00:06:32.210> the

multiple quests or get right into the
game's<00:06:32.509> campaign<00:06:32.780> mode<00:06:33.199> now<00:06:33.949> that<00:06:34.130> campaign

00:06:34.480 --> 00:06:34.490 
game's campaign mode now that campaign

00:06:34.490 --> 00:06:36.610

the quests and because how well you do
in<00:06:45.530> early<00:06:45.889> ones<00:06:46.069> affects<00:06:46.849> what's<00:06:47.120> available
