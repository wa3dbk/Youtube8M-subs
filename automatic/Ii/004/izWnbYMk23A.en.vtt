00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:34.480 
now the layer underneath the lemon is

00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:37.290 
now the layer underneath the lemon is
the<00:02:34.960> white<00:02:35.230> the<00:02:35.590> pith<00:02:35.860> and<00:02:36.100> that<00:02:36.430> is<00:02:36.910> bitter

the white the pith and that is bitter
and<00:02:37.660> that<00:02:37.810> is<00:02:37.870> not<00:02:38.050> something<00:02:38.170> that<00:02:38.410> we<00:02:38.500> want

00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:38.620 
and that is not something that we want

00:02:38.620 --> 00:02:41.030 
and that is not something that we want
in<00:02:38.770> the<00:02:38.800> bowl<00:02:39.010> we<00:02:39.160> just<00:02:39.400> want<00:02:39.580> the<00:02:39.700> yellow<00:02:39.970> part

cream<00:05:13.410> unfortunately<00:05:14.410> when<00:05:14.530> I<00:05:14.560> started<00:05:14.920> this

00:05:15.090 --> 00:05:15.100 
cream unfortunately when I started this

00:05:15.100 --> 00:05:16.770 
cream unfortunately when I started this
recipe<00:05:15.580> I<00:05:15.610> was<00:05:15.970> using<00:05:16.180> cream<00:05:16.480> that<00:05:16.660> was<00:05:16.750> a

00:05:16.770 --> 00:05:16.780 
recipe I was using cream that was a

00:05:16.780 --> 00:05:18.180 
recipe I was using cream that was a
little<00:05:17.080> bit<00:05:17.170> on<00:05:17.290> the<00:05:17.380> older<00:05:17.500> side<00:05:17.680> it<00:05:18.100> was

00:05:18.180 --> 00:05:18.190 
little bit on the older side it was

00:05:18.190 --> 00:05:19.860 
little bit on the older side it was
already<00:05:18.550> soured<00:05:19.090> and<00:05:19.330> when<00:05:19.420> I<00:05:19.450> added<00:05:19.660> the

00:05:19.860 --> 00:05:19.870 
already soured and when I added the

00:05:19.870 --> 00:05:22.470 
already soured and when I added the
lemon<00:05:20.050> juice<00:05:20.380> to<00:05:20.620> it<00:05:20.650> it<00:05:20.860> became<00:05:21.190> so<00:05:21.490> sour<00:05:21.760> that

00:05:22.470 --> 00:05:22.480 
lemon juice to it it became so sour that

00:05:22.480 --> 00:05:25.200 
lemon juice to it it became so sour that
it<00:05:22.600> won't<00:05:22.750> whip<00:05:22.930> for<00:05:23.170> me<00:05:23.520> all<00:05:24.520> it's<00:05:24.790> not<00:05:24.910> lost

00:05:25.200 --> 00:05:25.210 
it won't whip for me all it's not lost

00:05:25.210 --> 00:05:27.330 
it won't whip for me all it's not lost
you<00:05:25.840> can<00:05:26.020> still<00:05:26.290> work<00:05:26.470> with<00:05:26.680> this<00:05:26.860> you<00:05:27.220> just

00:05:27.330 --> 00:05:27.340 
you can still work with this you just

00:05:27.340 --> 00:05:28.910 
you can still work with this you just
have<00:05:27.490> to<00:05:27.640> choose<00:05:27.790> a<00:05:27.850> different<00:05:28.030> method

00:05:28.910 --> 00:05:28.920 
have to choose a different method

00:05:28.920 --> 00:05:30.990 
have to choose a different method
instead<00:05:29.920> of<00:05:30.040> trying<00:05:30.370> to<00:05:30.460> whip<00:05:30.580> the<00:05:30.730> cream<00:05:30.940> you

00:05:30.990 --> 00:05:31.000 
instead of trying to whip the cream you

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:32.280 
instead of trying to whip the cream you
can<00:05:31.270> just<00:05:31.450> pour<00:05:31.660> it<00:05:31.720> through<00:05:31.750> an<00:05:31.960> ice<00:05:32.050> cream

00:05:32.280 --> 00:05:32.290 
can just pour it through an ice cream

00:05:32.290 --> 00:05:34.080 
can just pour it through an ice cream
maker<00:05:32.440> which<00:05:32.740> is<00:05:32.860> what<00:05:33.010> I<00:05:33.040> will<00:05:33.370> ultimately<00:05:33.820> do

00:05:34.080 --> 00:05:34.090 
maker which is what I will ultimately do

00:05:34.090 --> 00:05:36.750 
maker which is what I will ultimately do
since<00:05:34.450> I<00:05:34.540> have<00:05:34.750> one<00:05:34.960> if<00:05:35.260> you<00:05:35.500> don't<00:05:35.770> pour<00:05:36.670> it

00:05:36.750 --> 00:05:36.760 
since I have one if you don't pour it

00:05:36.760 --> 00:05:39.420 
since I have one if you don't pour it
into<00:05:36.910> a<00:05:37.090> large<00:05:37.540> ice<00:05:37.870> cream<00:05:38.230> dish<00:05:38.740> or<00:05:39.070> a<00:05:39.100> freezer

00:05:50.190 --> 00:05:50.200 
you could use an ice cream maker or if

00:05:50.200 --> 00:05:52.710 
you could use an ice cream maker or if
you<00:05:50.380> had<00:05:50.620> been<00:05:51.100> able<00:05:51.250> to<00:05:51.340> use<00:05:51.520> a<00:05:51.550> mixer<00:05:52.000> but<00:05:52.570> it

00:05:52.710 --> 00:05:52.720 
you had been able to use a mixer but it

00:05:52.720 --> 00:05:56.120 
you had been able to use a mixer but it
