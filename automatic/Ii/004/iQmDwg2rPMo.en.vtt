didn't<00:02:24.220> like<00:02:24.340> it<00:02:24.580> and<00:02:24.970> then<00:02:25.390> with<00:02:25.600> sides<00:02:25.840> it's

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:26.050 
didn't like it and then with sides it's

00:02:26.050 --> 00:02:28.080 
didn't like it and then with sides it's
got<00:02:26.110> these<00:02:26.380> for<00:02:26.620> a<00:02:26.650> year<00:02:27.010> which<00:02:27.880> would<00:02:27.970> be

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:28.090 
got these for a year which would be

00:02:28.090 --> 00:02:29.880
