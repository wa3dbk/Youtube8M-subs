grade it allows us to build it in
process<00:00:48.970> of<00:00:49.120> stamping<00:00:49.720> and<00:00:49.900> it's<00:00:50.380> great<00:00:50.830> for

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:51.180 
process of stamping and it's great for

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:54.420 
process of stamping and it's great for
anti-corrosion<00:00:52.180> and<00:00:52.840> it's<00:00:53.170> less<00:00:53.830> susceptible

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:54.430 
anti-corrosion and it's less susceptible

00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:56.290 
to the stress cracking this is a

00:00:56.290 --> 00:00:57.990 
to the stress cracking this is a
condensing<00:00:56.860> unit<00:00:57.190> yes<00:00:57.370> sir<00:00:57.550> we<00:00:57.820> have<00:00:57.850> a

00:00:57.990 --> 00:00:58.000 
condensing unit yes sir we have a

00:00:58.000 --> 00:00:59.610 
condensing unit yes sir we have a
primary<00:00:58.300> heat<00:00:58.570> exchanger<00:00:59.020> and<00:00:59.170> a<00:00:59.230> secondary

00:00:59.610 --> 00:00:59.620 
primary heat exchanger and a secondary

00:00:59.620 --> 00:01:01.770 
primary heat exchanger and a secondary
heat<00:00:59.830> exchanger<00:01:00.280> to<00:01:00.880> pass<00:01:01.150> with<00:01:01.480> the<00:01:01.600> water

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:01.780 
heat exchanger to pass with the water

00:01:01.780 --> 00:01:03.570 
heat exchanger to pass with the water
way<00:01:02.020> through<00:01:02.320> there<00:01:02.470> multiple<00:01:02.950> paths<00:01:03.220> and

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:03.580 
way through there multiple paths and

00:01:03.580 --> 00:01:05.820 
way through there multiple paths and
then<00:01:03.970> we<00:01:04.119> are<00:01:04.269> a<00:01:04.299> down<00:01:04.629> fired<00:01:04.989> burner<00:01:05.320> which

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:05.830 
then we are a down fired burner which

00:01:05.830 --> 00:01:07.890 
then we are a down fired burner which
allows<00:01:06.130> us<00:01:06.400> to<00:01:06.520> use<00:01:06.700> the<00:01:06.729> condensate<00:01:07.479> to

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:07.900 
allows us to use the condensate to

00:01:07.900 --> 00:01:10.140 
allows us to use the condensate to
preheat<00:01:08.320> incoming<00:01:08.950> water<00:01:09.189> so<00:01:09.759> we<00:01:09.880> get<00:01:10.000> that

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:10.150 
preheat incoming water so we get that

00:01:10.150 --> 00:01:11.820 
preheat incoming water so we get that
high<00:01:10.360> efficiency<00:01:10.930> but<00:01:11.200> the<00:01:11.320> greatest<00:01:11.560> thing

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:11.830 
high efficiency but the greatest thing

00:01:11.830 --> 00:01:13.680 
high efficiency but the greatest thing
about<00:01:11.890> this<00:01:12.310> is<00:01:12.490> is<00:01:12.640> because<00:01:12.970> of<00:01:13.120> our<00:01:13.210> advanced

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:13.690 
about this is is because of our advanced

00:01:13.690 --> 00:01:16.500 
about this is is because of our advanced
burner<00:01:14.020> system<00:01:14.350> and<00:01:14.860> our<00:01:15.130> venturi<00:01:15.670> we've<00:01:16.300> got

is<00:02:08.129> the<00:02:08.369> first<00:02:08.580> priority<00:02:09.030> for<00:02:09.300> us<00:02:09.479> secondly<00:02:10.259> is

00:02:10.369 --> 00:02:10.379 
is the first priority for us secondly is

00:02:10.379 --> 00:02:12.500 
is the first priority for us secondly is
comfort<00:02:10.860> so<00:02:11.489> we<00:02:11.640> really<00:02:11.940> don't<00:02:12.090> want<00:02:12.360> the

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:12.510 
comfort so we really don't want the

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:15.140 
comfort so we really don't want the
homeowner<00:02:12.900> to<00:02:13.080> sacrifice<00:02:13.650> their<00:02:14.250> comfort<00:02:14.910> and

homeowner to sacrifice their comfort and

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:16.790 
homeowner to sacrifice their comfort and
then<00:02:15.300> the<00:02:15.390> third<00:02:15.569> component<00:02:15.930> is<00:02:16.319> in<00:02:16.500> small

00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:16.800 
then the third component is in small

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:19.070 
then the third component is in small

00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:08.330 
installation this is our n PE a model
the<00:03:06.750> advanced<00:03:07.079> series<00:03:07.349> which<00:03:07.890> comes<00:03:08.129> with<00:03:08.280> the

the advanced series which comes with the

00:03:09.979 --> 00:03:09.989 
internal circulator and the buffer tank

00:03:09.989 --> 00:03:13.009 
internal circulator and the buffer tank
what<00:03:10.530> we<00:03:10.650> built<00:03:10.920> was<00:03:11.129> a<00:03:11.160> p9<00:03:11.910> controller<00:03:12.450> to

00:03:13.009 --> 00:03:13.019 
what we built was a p9 controller to

00:03:13.019 --> 00:03:15.740 
what we built was a p9 controller to
apply<00:03:13.350> to<00:03:13.410> a<00:03:13.709> air<00:03:14.370> handler<00:03:14.790> for<00:03:15.120> situations

00:03:15.740 --> 00:03:15.750 
apply to a air handler for situations

00:03:15.750 --> 00:03:17.240 
apply to a air handler for situations
where<00:03:15.959> it's<00:03:16.139> a<00:03:16.260> budget-minded<00:03:16.889> type

00:03:17.240 --> 00:03:17.250 
where it's a budget-minded type

00:03:17.250 --> 00:03:19.340 
where it's a budget-minded type
application<00:03:18.030> where<00:03:18.660> they<00:03:18.780> want<00:03:18.959> to<00:03:19.049> use<00:03:19.139> air

00:03:19.340 --> 00:03:19.350 
application where they want to use air

00:03:19.350 --> 00:03:21.470 
application where they want to use air
handler<00:03:19.739> and<00:03:19.950> it's<00:03:20.069> a<00:03:20.160> copy<00:03:20.430> type<00:03:20.700> application

00:03:21.470 --> 00:03:21.480 
handler and it's a copy type application

00:03:21.480 --> 00:03:23.990 
handler and it's a copy type application
so<00:03:21.989> it's<00:03:22.470> a<00:03:22.680> little<00:03:22.889> controller<00:03:23.400> that<00:03:23.639> we<00:03:23.760> have

00:03:23.990 --> 00:03:24.000 
so it's a little controller that we have

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:27.140 
so it's a little controller that we have
allows<00:03:24.690> the<00:03:25.019> unit<00:03:25.590> to<00:03:25.620> control<00:03:26.370> the<00:03:26.519> pump<00:03:26.790> and

00:03:27.140 --> 00:03:27.150 
allows the unit to control the pump and

00:03:27.150 --> 00:03:28.789 
allows the unit to control the pump and
it<00:03:27.269> becomes<00:03:27.569> the<00:03:27.720> heating<00:03:28.019> pump<00:03:28.230> which<00:03:28.470> we<00:03:28.620> can

00:03:28.789 --> 00:03:28.799 
it becomes the heating pump which we can

00:03:28.799 --> 00:03:30.740 
it becomes the heating pump which we can
interface<00:03:29.069> with<00:03:29.489> the<00:03:29.639> fan<00:03:29.880> and<00:03:30.359> we<00:03:30.420> can<00:03:30.599> also

00:03:30.740 --> 00:03:30.750 
interface with the fan and we can also

00:03:30.750 --> 00:03:33.319 
interface with the fan and we can also
do<00:03:31.049> an<00:03:31.230> outdoor<00:03:31.470> sensor<00:03:31.920> we<00:03:32.579> can<00:03:32.760> reset<00:03:33.150> the

00:03:33.319 --> 00:03:33.329 
do an outdoor sensor we can reset the

00:03:33.329 --> 00:03:35.000
