00:00:00.040 --> 00:00:05.950
 or the rock that I had here manuel is 

00:00:02.199 --> 00:00:09.490
 bad in destination today we're going to see the rifle 

00:00:05.950 --> 00:00:12.099
 legendary to what the truth is going 

00:00:09.490 --> 00:00:14.769
 of man not to what the risk comes 

00:00:12.099 --> 00:00:16.450
 is the reward itself also the 

00:00:14.769 --> 00:00:19.090
 secondary message the truth is that 

00:00:16.450 --> 00:00:21.940
 It also sends fabric are worth a cadence 

00:00:19.090 --> 00:00:23.920
 very good a normal impact 

00:00:21.940 --> 00:00:27.010
 reach also normal and is 

00:00:23.920 --> 00:00:29.290
 very good stability and a recharge 

00:00:27.010 --> 00:00:31.300
 quite quite acceptable the charger 

00:00:29.290 --> 00:00:33.550
 neither is left behind being quite 

00:00:31.300 --> 00:00:35.940
 generous his two qualities there the 

00:00:33.550 --> 00:00:37.750
 we have persistence and rangefinder 

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:40.330
 persistence while longer 

00:00:37.750 --> 00:00:42.940
 we have with the weapon the weapon will be more 

00:00:40.330 --> 00:00:45.340
 and more precisely why it has the 

00:00:42.940 --> 00:00:47.410
 charger a little bit longer so that 

00:00:45.340 --> 00:00:49.990
 take advantage of this feature 

00:00:47.410 --> 00:00:53.739
 rangefinder aiming with the weapon increases your 

00:00:49.990 --> 00:00:56.260
 effective reach if the reach increases 

00:00:53.739 --> 00:00:58.180
 of the bullets will assert that the 

00:00:56.260 --> 00:01:01.300
 bullets arrive with 

00:00:58.180 --> 00:01:06.100
 much more good harm when it comes to choosing 

00:01:01.300 --> 00:01:08.770
 what are your your improvements I have 

00:01:06.100 --> 00:01:11.080
 opposite better or better to with hammer 

00:01:08.770 --> 00:01:13.300
 so that the scope is better or the 

00:01:11.080 --> 00:01:15.970
 heavier ammunition already depends on 

00:01:13.300 --> 00:01:18.070
 you but good if we put together what is 

00:01:15.970 --> 00:01:20.470
 the improvement of hammer with his 

00:01:18.070 --> 00:01:23.140
 feature rangefinder we'll get that 

00:01:20.470 --> 00:01:26.229
 a weapon that when shooting from distances 

00:01:23.140 --> 00:01:28.630
 Long socks will do almost the same damage 

00:01:26.229 --> 00:01:31.990
 almost the same damage as if we were 

00:01:28.630 --> 00:01:34.720
 shooting at almost point-blank is worth it 

00:01:31.990 --> 00:01:37.800
 that is basically the function of the 

00:01:34.720 --> 00:01:40.630
 weapon we have a weapon that if we use it 

00:01:37.800 --> 00:01:42.660
 putting half is always worth putting 

00:01:40.630 --> 00:01:45.580
 peephole and putting that modification 

00:01:42.660 --> 00:01:48.310
 putting in that modification he was forced to 

00:01:45.580 --> 00:01:51.280
 again we can find that a rifle 

00:01:48.310 --> 00:01:53.409
 of assault that hurts that conserves very 

00:01:51.280 --> 00:01:55.960
 well the damage although this one 

00:01:53.409 --> 00:01:58.810
 and is being shot from stockings to 

00:01:55.960 --> 00:02:01.149
 long distance and point to that it 

00:01:58.810 --> 00:02:04.600
 we add persistence then good 

00:02:01.149 --> 00:02:08.110
 the better it is really worth 

00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:11.049
 worth it if it deserves a lot very much the 

00:02:08.110 --> 00:02:13.269
 worth to be advisable is 

00:02:11.049 --> 00:02:16.510
 recommended for all classes and I 

00:02:13.269 --> 00:02:19.180
 getting it by buying it in the 

00:02:16.510 --> 00:02:22.480
 avant-garde is in the vanguard for 

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:25.030
 one hundred and fifty points of the vanguard the 

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:27.519
 truly very good also very good in the 

00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:30.129
 allan multiplayer mode too 

00:02:27.519 --> 00:02:34.390
 very good remember keep very well 

00:02:30.129 --> 00:02:36.730
 this weapon the damage but very very well here 

00:02:34.390 --> 00:02:38.829
 let's see a demonstration of marksmanship 

00:02:36.730 --> 00:02:40.310
 even with an enemy that has a 

00:02:38.829 --> 00:02:42.440
 shield 

00:02:40.310 --> 00:02:45.410
 pretty good and enough life to be 

00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:47.660
 a special event they are watching 

00:02:45.410 --> 00:02:49.849
 to get the look and attention right 

00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:51.590
 we put and go all the bullets to the 

00:02:49.849 --> 00:02:54.470
 head that would have been an enemy 

00:02:51.590 --> 00:02:56.690
 normal and surely would have died 

00:02:54.470 --> 00:03:00.380
 it's quite quite enough time not 

00:02:56.690 --> 00:03:03.790
 nothing said what the rifle called 

00:03:00.380 --> 00:03:06.760
 what comes is great 

00:03:03.790 --> 00:03:10.180
 there are other competitors that are 

00:03:06.760 --> 00:03:13.860
 it seems the characteristics that it has 

00:03:10.180 --> 00:03:17.010
 the main are worth persistence 

00:03:13.860 --> 00:03:19.230
 it's a feature that we do not see much 

00:03:17.010 --> 00:03:22.260
 in weapons but what good power can 

00:03:19.230 --> 00:03:25.020
 to be found up there super but 

00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:27.570
 rangefinder is something also very much 

00:03:25.020 --> 00:03:29.310
 much rarer to see also 

00:03:27.570 --> 00:03:32.160
 can see in other weapons but it's 

00:03:29.310 --> 00:03:34.140
 much rarer to see those two are worth 

00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:36.780
 characteristics as I have been saying 

00:03:34.140 --> 00:03:40.020
 put together and we will get a good weapon for 

00:03:36.780 --> 00:03:43.380
 attack half long distances what 

00:03:40.020 --> 00:03:45.780
 said if we look for the critical point of 

00:03:43.380 --> 00:03:48.750
 enemy in question because nothing will be like 

00:03:45.780 --> 00:03:51.959
 almost shoot him point-blank is worth almost 

00:03:48.750 --> 00:03:53.700
 how to shoot at close range if we're 

00:03:51.959 --> 00:03:55.970
 very sick of the damage coming from 

00:03:53.700 --> 00:03:58.250
 way so 

00:03:55.970 --> 00:04:00.560
 so high we can always put the 

00:03:58.250 --> 00:04:01.910
 heavy bullets like I had put in 

00:04:00.560 --> 00:04:05.390
 First instance 

00:04:01.910 --> 00:04:07.550
 yes, as I have been saying, we get fed up 

00:04:05.390 --> 00:04:10.790
 that have so much power of average to 

00:04:07.550 --> 00:04:12.770
 long distance or just if we are going to 

00:04:10.790 --> 00:04:13.880
 attack an enemy always short to 

00:04:12.770 --> 00:04:16.640
 middle distance 

00:04:13.880 --> 00:04:18.620
 remember that the weapon is versatile is not 

00:04:16.640 --> 00:04:20.350
 as versatile as others we've seen 

00:04:18.620 --> 00:04:24.410
 but good the staff and in that aspect 

00:04:20.350 --> 00:04:28.240
 and that nothing according to the situation according to 

00:04:24.410 --> 00:04:30.340
 to put it one way or another 

00:04:28.240 --> 00:04:32.860
 the truth has been worth me 

00:04:30.340 --> 00:04:34.870
 It's worth it, it made me happy 

00:04:32.860 --> 00:04:37.360
 buy it the truth I was happy 

00:04:34.870 --> 00:04:40.870
 buy it is another of the weapons that you 

00:04:37.360 --> 00:04:44.319
 I bring after the update this 

00:04:40.870 --> 00:04:48.160
 and the dlc of darkness is worth me 

00:04:44.319 --> 00:04:50.199
 I liked it, yes, but what I said 

00:04:48.160 --> 00:04:53.139
 I still have weapons to examine and 

00:04:50.199 --> 00:04:56.280
 before this tlc so nothing and the already 

00:04:53.139 --> 00:04:59.800
 they are and detracting for the best 

00:04:56.280 --> 00:05:01.900
 because the video is not very long 

00:04:59.800 --> 00:05:04.240
 because the video is not very long because 

00:05:01.900 --> 00:05:07.420
 not much to explain not worth 

00:05:04.240 --> 00:05:10.529
 because there is not much to explain either 

00:05:07.420 --> 00:05:13.469
 the truth a good weapon 

00:05:10.529 --> 00:05:16.829
 if it's worth buying the good 

00:05:13.469 --> 00:05:19.619
 benefits and others so for my little 

00:05:16.829 --> 00:05:21.509
 more must be said is worth nothing now as 

00:05:19.619 --> 00:05:23.519
 I always say thank you for having seen me and 

00:05:21.509 --> 00:05:26.009
 a hug to all remember give to 

00:05:23.519 --> 00:05:30.649
 like comment subscribe download my 

00:05:26.009 --> 00:05:30.649
