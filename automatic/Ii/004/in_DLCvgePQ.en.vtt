00:02:20.230 --> 00:02:20.240 
has gotten so much better as a season

00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:21.340 
has gotten so much better as a season
has<00:02:20.330> gone<00:02:20.450> along<00:02:20.600> because<00:02:20.870> they're<00:02:20.990> so<00:02:21.140> young

00:02:21.340 --> 00:02:21.350 
has gone along because they're so young

Louisville<00:02:22.820> is<00:02:22.880> healthy<00:02:23.150> and<00:02:23.210> they<00:02:23.300> are

00:02:23.380 --> 00:02:23.390 
Louisville is healthy and they are

00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:24.910 
Louisville is healthy and they are
healthy<00:02:23.570> and<00:02:23.780> I<00:02:23.870> think<00:02:23.900> that<00:02:24.230> they'll<00:02:24.470> that's

00:02:24.910 --> 00:02:24.920 
healthy and I think that they'll that's

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:27.190 
healthy and I think that they'll that's
going<00:02:25.160> to<00:02:25.280> benefit<00:02:25.700> them<00:02:25.850> for<00:02:26.300> maybe<00:02:26.450> 25

00:02:27.190 --> 00:02:27.200 
going to benefit them for maybe 25

00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:28.660 
going to benefit them for maybe 25
minutes<00:02:27.230> of<00:02:27.650> this<00:02:27.740> game<00:02:27.830> and<00:02:28.160> suppose<00:02:28.460> maybe

00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:28.670 
minutes of this game and suppose maybe

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:30.370 
minutes of this game and suppose maybe
15<00:02:29.090> right<00:02:29.450> but<00:02:29.540> it's<00:02:29.660> just<00:02:29.750> so<00:02:29.960> hard<00:02:29.990> to<00:02:30.320> keep

00:02:30.370 --> 00:02:30.380 
15 right but it's just so hard to keep

00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:32.050 
15 right but it's just so hard to keep
up<00:02:30.560> Kentucky<00:02:31.010> for<00:02:31.160> 40<00:02:31.430> minutes<00:02:31.610> because<00:02:31.820> they

00:02:32.050 --> 00:02:32.060 
up Kentucky for 40 minutes because they

00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:34.090 
up Kentucky for 40 minutes because they
have<00:02:32.210> guys<00:02:32.390> all<00:02:33.080> over<00:02:33.440> the<00:02:33.530> court<00:02:33.800> that<00:02:33.950> can

00:02:34.090 --> 00:02:34.100 
have guys all over the court that can

00:02:34.100 --> 00:02:35.920 
have guys all over the court that can
score<00:02:34.370> and<00:02:34.610> defend<00:02:34.940> whereas<00:02:35.240> Louisville<00:02:35.720> I

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:35.930 
score and defend whereas Louisville I

00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:37.990 
score and defend whereas Louisville I
think<00:02:36.590> they<00:02:36.740> are<00:02:36.890> just<00:02:37.130> said<00:02:37.310> a<00:02:37.340> disadvantage

00:02:37.990 --> 00:02:38.000 
think they are just said a disadvantage

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:38.920 
think they are just said a disadvantage
down<00:02:38.150> low<00:02:38.300> they're<00:02:38.450> gonna<00:02:38.540> have<00:02:38.660> to<00:02:38.690> somehow

00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:38.930 
down low they're gonna have to somehow

00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:41.170 
down low they're gonna have to somehow
get<00:02:39.140> like<00:02:39.350> 30<00:02:39.680> points<00:02:39.860> from<00:02:40.040> Russ<00:02:40.250> Smith<00:02:40.520> which

00:02:41.170 --> 00:02:41.180 
get like 30 points from Russ Smith which

00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:42.610 
get like 30 points from Russ Smith which
is<00:02:41.210> capable<00:02:41.750> of<00:02:41.810> doing<00:02:42.050> he<00:02:42.140> actually<00:02:42.380> did<00:02:42.530> it

00:02:42.610 --> 00:02:42.620 
is capable of doing he actually did it

00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:44.800 
is capable of doing he actually did it
against<00:02:42.830> Kentucky<00:02:43.340> in<00:02:43.940> December<00:02:44.450> but<00:02:44.600> it's

00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:44.810 
against Kentucky in December but it's

00:02:44.810 --> 00:02:47.020 
against Kentucky in December but it's
just<00:02:44.990> you<00:02:45.620> you're<00:02:45.860> relying<00:02:46.220> you're<00:02:46.640> asking

00:02:47.020 --> 00:02:47.030 
just you you're relying you're asking

00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:48.580

00:03:06.550 --> 00:03:06.560 
affected by a stage like this whether or

00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:08.050 
affected by a stage like this whether or
not<00:03:06.650> you<00:03:06.950> know<00:03:07.040> playing<00:03:07.310> to<00:03:07.550> the<00:03:07.670> stage<00:03:07.880> or

00:03:08.050 --> 00:03:08.060 
not you know playing to the stage or

00:03:08.060 --> 00:03:10.060 
not you know playing to the stage or
actually<00:03:08.330> maybe<00:03:08.480> wilting<00:03:09.020> on<00:03:09.260> that<00:03:09.560> stat<00:03:09.770> you

00:03:10.060 --> 00:03:10.070 
actually maybe wilting on that stat you

00:03:10.070 --> 00:03:11.290 
actually maybe wilting on that stat you
look<00:03:10.220> too<00:03:10.340> much<00:03:10.370> into<00:03:10.520> that<00:03:10.880> I<00:03:10.910> mean<00:03:11.000> I<00:03:11.120> know<00:03:11.240> it

00:03:11.290 --> 00:03:11.300 
look too much into that I mean I know it

00:03:11.300 --> 00:03:13.240 
look too much into that I mean I know it
can<00:03:11.420> certainly<00:03:11.510> affect<00:03:11.930> a<00:03:12.230> team<00:03:12.650> but<00:03:12.950> I<00:03:12.980> think

00:03:13.240 --> 00:03:13.250 
can certainly affect a team but I think

00:03:13.250 --> 00:03:14.170 
can certainly affect a team but I think
you<00:03:13.370> just<00:03:13.400> have<00:03:13.610> to<00:03:13.670> look<00:03:13.790> at<00:03:13.880> the<00:03:13.940> team<00:03:14.090> that's

00:03:14.170 --> 00:03:14.180 
you just have to look at the team that's

00:03:14.180 --> 00:03:15.910 
you just have to look at the team that's
gonna<00:03:14.300> rely<00:03:14.630> most<00:03:14.930> on<00:03:15.200> the<00:03:15.290> outside<00:03:15.590> shot

00:03:15.910 --> 00:03:15.920
