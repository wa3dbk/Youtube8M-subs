00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:28.650 
for this one as well it's just that we

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:31.219 
for this one as well it's just that we
kept<00:01:28.920> on<00:01:29.100> failing<00:01:29.310> hopefully<00:01:30.000> in<00:01:30.240> this<00:01:30.960> video

00:01:31.219 --> 00:01:31.229 
kept on failing hopefully in this video

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:34.100 
kept on failing hopefully in this video
we<00:01:31.829> will<00:01:32.040> not<00:01:32.310> fail<00:01:32.640> but<00:01:32.939> we<00:01:33.090> might<00:01:33.299> I<00:01:33.540> mean<00:01:33.869> I

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:34.110 
we will not fail but we might I mean I

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:36.050 
we will not fail but we might I mean I
think<00:01:34.590> we<00:01:34.680> had<00:01:34.829> a<00:01:34.860> bear<00:01:35.130> at<00:01:35.220> a<00:01:35.250> 40-something

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:36.060 
think we had a bear at a 40-something

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:38.389 
think we had a bear at a 40-something
percent<00:01:36.420> chance<00:01:36.689> so<00:01:36.990> that's<00:01:37.500> not<00:01:37.649> as<00:01:37.890> bad<00:01:37.920> as

00:01:38.389 --> 00:01:38.399 
percent chance so that's not as bad as

00:01:38.399 --> 00:01:40.810 
percent chance so that's not as bad as
the<00:01:38.520> one<00:01:38.670> we<00:01:38.700> just<00:01:38.850> spun<00:01:39.329> let's<00:01:40.049> tap<00:01:40.229> on<00:01:40.409> it

00:01:40.810 --> 00:01:40.820 
the one we just spun let's tap on it

00:01:40.820 --> 00:01:43.219 
the one we just spun let's tap on it
yeah<00:01:41.820> we<00:01:42.000> have<00:01:42.149> about<00:01:42.450> a<00:01:42.479> 40-something

00:01:43.219 --> 00:01:43.229 
yeah we have about a 40-something

00:01:43.229 --> 00:01:44.929 
yeah we have about a 40-something
percent<00:01:43.560> chance<00:01:43.829> hopefully<00:01:44.159> we<00:01:44.460> get<00:01:44.610> it<00:01:44.759> let's

00:01:44.929 --> 00:01:44.939 
percent chance hopefully we get it let's

00:01:44.939 --> 00:01:50.300 
percent chance hopefully we get it let's
do<00:01:45.060> the<00:01:45.090> spin<00:01:46.579> and<00:01:47.750> we<00:01:48.750> don't<00:01:49.049> all<00:01:49.860> right<00:01:49.950> what

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:50.310 
do the spin and we don't all right what

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:53.420 
do the spin and we don't all right what
how<00:01:50.579> fail<00:01:50.969> is<00:01:51.329> that<00:01:51.810> all<00:01:52.320> right<00:01:52.380> so<00:01:53.130> we<00:01:53.250> also

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:53.430 
how fail is that all right so we also

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:56.889 
how fail is that all right so we also
got<00:01:53.850> some<00:01:54.689> premium<00:01:55.170> currency<00:01:55.380> as<00:01:55.829> well

00:01:56.889 --> 00:01:56.899 
got some premium currency as well
