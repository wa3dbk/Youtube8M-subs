00:00:04.580 --> 00:00:07.919
 Hi everyone, my name is eric le goff 

00:00:06.569 --> 00:00:09.929
 I will explain today the 

00:00:07.919 --> 00:00:11.820
 super rich ultra known death 

00:00:09.929 --> 00:00:13.049
 you know how to play it's perfect 

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:16.490
 to start the guitar it's all about 

00:00:13.049 --> 00:00:16.490
 smoke on the water from deep purple 

00:00:17.289 --> 00:00:20.589
 so I stole the piece of two 

00:00:18.730 --> 00:00:21.880
 ways the original way to do it 

00:00:20.589 --> 00:00:23.439
 ie as on the cd a 

00:00:21.880 --> 00:00:25.060
 ironically the rif and I also 

00:00:23.439 --> 00:00:26.890
 set for those who are already playing a bit of 

00:00:25.060 --> 00:00:28.570
 the guitar a version with the line of 

00:00:26.890 --> 00:00:30.219
 bass so for the right hand it's 

00:00:28.570 --> 00:00:33.309
 very simple so index and major on the 

00:00:30.219 --> 00:00:35.860
 body of ground re and warm you up 

00:00:33.309 --> 00:00:38.410
 strings this way 

00:00:35.860 --> 00:00:41.440
 you do not have to shoot too much to avoid 

00:00:38.410 --> 00:00:42.780
 the camps come slammed to barter 

00:00:41.440 --> 00:00:48.490
 between the keys it is not necessary 

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:50.440
 until then sound for the hand 

00:00:48.490 --> 00:00:54.340
 left we will support with the causes of 

00:00:50.440 --> 00:00:55.720
 metal that is to say one in which not so 

00:00:54.340 --> 00:00:58.210
 only major and the ring finger you 

00:00:55.720 --> 00:01:00.250
 place on the third box 

00:00:58.210 --> 00:01:02.200
 of the rope degrees the third box of 

00:01:00.250 --> 00:01:04.170
 the ground rope will support you here just 

00:01:02.200 --> 00:01:10.090
 after making his out of the life of 

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:11.520
 0 0 when david 11 00 after 3.3 after 

00:01:10.090 --> 00:01:14.530
 5.5 

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:24.729
 yes and it's still the same 38 0 

00:01:14.530 --> 00:01:27.280
 level 3 then in fact 035 and for 

00:01:24.729 --> 00:01:42.460

00:01:42.460 --> 00:01:46.090
 the arranged version with the line of 

00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:49.750
 bass that would give his then to use 

00:01:46.090 --> 00:01:52.799
 boxed and specific with the thumb on 

00:01:49.750 --> 00:01:52.799
 the bass line that would give its 

00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:08.350
 power generation when superimposed 

00:02:05.590 --> 00:02:09.459
 riffs and bass that will give some 

00:02:08.350 --> 00:02:12.660
 rights of a little bit of chelou points 

00:02:09.459 --> 00:02:12.660
 choose but it will give that 

00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:29.670
