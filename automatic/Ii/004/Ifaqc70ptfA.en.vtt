would<00:00:27.449> look<00:00:27.689> the<00:00:28.080> original<00:00:28.529> Wii<00:00:28.680> games<00:00:28.890> would

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:29.070 
would look the original Wii games would

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:30.679 
would look the original Wii games would
look<00:00:29.250> better<00:00:29.400> on<00:00:29.519> the<00:00:29.670> Wii<00:00:29.820> U<00:00:29.849> Nintendo<00:00:30.179> said

00:00:30.679 --> 00:00:30.689 
look better on the Wii U Nintendo said

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:34.760 
look better on the Wii U Nintendo said
no<00:00:30.869> they<00:00:31.019> would<00:00:31.170> look<00:00:31.289> the<00:00:31.439> same<00:00:31.470> and<00:00:32.420> I<00:00:33.770> think

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:34.770 
no they would look the same and I think

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:36.680 
no they would look the same and I think
I<00:00:34.920> remember<00:00:35.000> telling<00:00:36.000> you<00:00:36.149> guys<00:00:36.300> that<00:00:36.570> it

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:36.690 
I remember telling you guys that it

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:40.700 
I remember telling you guys that it
would<00:00:36.809> look<00:00:36.989> better<00:00:37.260> based<00:00:38.190> on<00:00:38.520> it<00:00:38.760> being<00:00:39.710> HDMI

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:40.710 
would look better based on it being HDMI

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:42.860 
would look better based on it being HDMI
alone<00:00:41.160> like<00:00:41.760> there<00:00:42.090> was<00:00:42.210> no<00:00:42.329> way<00:00:42.510> that<00:00:42.719> it

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:42.870 
alone like there was no way that it

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:46.130 
alone like there was no way that it
wasn't<00:00:43.050> gonna<00:00:43.320> look<00:00:43.610> better<00:00:44.610> right<00:00:45.140> well

00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:46.140 
wasn't gonna look better right well

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:50.920 
wasn't gonna look better right well
looks<00:00:47.070> like<00:00:47.160> I<00:00:48.680> was<00:00:49.680> right

00:00:50.920 --> 00:00:50.930 
looks like I was right

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:53.779 
looks like I was right
surprise<00:00:51.930> surprise<00:00:52.110> but<00:00:53.070> anyway<00:00:53.399> this<00:00:53.579> is

00:00:53.779 --> 00:00:53.789 
surprise surprise but anyway this is

00:00:53.789 --> 00:00:57.110 
surprise surprise but anyway this is
actually<00:00:54.210> even<00:00:54.360> better<00:00:54.510> than<00:00:55.379> I<00:00:55.530> thought

00:00:57.110 --> 00:00:57.120 
actually even better than I thought

00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:05.329 
actually even better than I thought
if<00:00:57.600> you<00:00:58.170> go<00:01:00.140> this<00:01:01.140> is<00:01:01.320> my<00:01:03.350> wii<00:01:04.350> controller<00:01:05.070> if

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:14.640 
original Wii to play those games now

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:19.310 
original Wii to play those games now
when<00:01:14.880> you<00:01:15.090> play<00:01:15.900> the<00:01:16.170> Wii<00:01:16.500> on<00:01:16.890> an<00:01:17.490> HDTV<00:01:18.320> when

when you play the Wii on an HDTV when

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:22.370 
when you play the Wii on an HDTV when
you<00:01:19.439> change<00:01:19.740> that<00:01:19.979> output<00:01:20.689> it'll<00:01:21.689> usually<00:01:21.869> say

00:01:22.370 --> 00:01:22.380 
you change that output it'll usually say

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:24.620 
you change that output it'll usually say
the<00:01:23.189> resolution<00:01:23.850> that<00:01:23.970> you're<00:01:24.150> playing<00:01:24.420> at

00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:24.630 
the resolution that you're playing at

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:28.910 
the resolution that you're playing at
they<00:01:24.810> will<00:01:24.869> say<00:01:25.340> 480p<00:01:27.020> but<00:01:28.020> when<00:01:28.770> you're

00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:28.920 
they will say 480p but when you're

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:31.910 
they will say 480p but when you're
playing<00:01:29.070> on<00:01:29.369> the<00:01:29.430> Wii<00:01:29.700> U<00:01:29.729> and<00:01:30.360> you<00:01:31.320> do<00:01:31.500> the<00:01:31.680> same

00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:31.920 
playing on the Wii U and you do the same

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:41.930 
playing on the Wii U and you do the same
thing<00:01:34.490> look<00:01:35.490> what<00:01:35.670> happens

00:01:41.930 --> 00:01:41.940 

00:01:41.940 --> 00:01:45.540 

it's<00:01:42.940> displaying<00:01:43.720> it<00:01:44.050> at<00:01:44.260> whatever<00:01:44.920> your<00:01:45.160> TV

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:45.550 
it's displaying it at whatever your TV

00:01:45.550 --> 00:01:48.840 
it's displaying it at whatever your TV
is<00:01:45.610> capable<00:01:46.120> of<00:01:46.240> displaying<00:01:46.600> it<00:01:47.430> you<00:01:48.430> see<00:01:48.640> on

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:48.850 
is capable of displaying it you see on

00:01:48.850 --> 00:01:52.950 
is capable of displaying it you see on
my<00:01:49.000> TV<00:01:49.420> is<00:01:49.510> displaying<00:01:49.780> it<00:01:50.470> at<00:01:51.090> 1080p<00:01:52.090> so<00:01:52.930> I

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:52.960 
my TV is displaying it at 1080p so I

00:01:52.960 --> 00:01:56.430 
my TV is displaying it at 1080p so I
tested<00:01:53.410> it<00:01:53.740> out<00:01:53.920> and<00:01:54.480> quite<00:01:55.480> a<00:01:55.510> few<00:01:55.840> games<00:01:56.110> look

00:01:56.430 --> 00:01:56.440 
tested it out and quite a few games look

00:01:56.440 --> 00:02:00.000 
tested it out and quite a few games look
a<00:01:56.940> lot<00:01:57.940> better<00:01:58.210> on<00:01:58.330> the<00:01:58.630> Wii<00:01:58.840> U<00:01:58.870> than<00:01:59.770> they<00:01:59.950> did

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:00.010 
a lot better on the Wii U than they did

00:02:00.010 --> 00:02:03.390 
a lot better on the Wii U than they did
on<00:02:00.550> the<00:02:01.240> Wii<00:02:01.450> and<00:02:01.750> the<00:02:01.840> reason<00:02:02.830> for<00:02:02.860> that<00:02:03.070> is

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:03.400 
on the Wii and the reason for that is

00:02:03.400 --> 00:02:08.730 
on the Wii and the reason for that is
originally<00:02:05.130> it<00:02:06.130> relied<00:02:06.610> on<00:02:06.940> your<00:02:07.210> TV<00:02:07.900> to

00:02:08.730 --> 00:02:08.740 
originally it relied on your TV to

00:02:08.740 --> 00:02:11.220 
originally it relied on your TV to
pretty<00:02:08.979> much<00:02:09.190> take<00:02:09.550> the<00:02:09.820> 480p<00:02:10.300> image<00:02:10.960> and

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:11.230 
pretty much take the 480p image and

00:02:11.230 --> 00:02:15.330 
pretty much take the 480p image and
stretch<00:02:12.100> it<00:02:12.520> to<00:02:13.020> fit<00:02:14.020> the<00:02:14.530> size<00:02:14.740> of<00:02:15.010> the<00:02:15.100> screen

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:15.340 
stretch it to fit the size of the screen

00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:18.720 
stretch it to fit the size of the screen
and<00:02:16.110> 1080p<00:02:17.110> for<00:02:17.380> example<00:02:17.830> is<00:02:17.920> like<00:02:18.040> four<00:02:18.400> times

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:18.730 
and 1080p for example is like four times

00:02:18.730 --> 00:02:24.210 
and 1080p for example is like four times
the<00:02:19.060> pixels<00:02:19.570> at<00:02:20.230> least<00:02:20.590> of<00:02:20.880> a<00:02:21.880> 480p<00:02:22.870> image<00:02:23.590> so

00:02:24.210 --> 00:02:24.220 
the pixels at least of a 480p image so

00:02:24.220 --> 00:02:26.790 
the pixels at least of a 480p image so
your<00:02:24.640> TV<00:02:25.090> was<00:02:25.390> artificially<00:02:26.200> stretching<00:02:26.710> the

00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:26.800 
your TV was artificially stretching the

00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:29.640 
your TV was artificially stretching the
image<00:02:27.130> out<00:02:27.370> and<00:02:27.730> that's<00:02:28.450> what<00:02:28.810> made<00:02:29.050> Wii<00:02:29.380> games

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:29.650 
image out and that's what made Wii games

00:02:29.650 --> 00:02:33.300 
image out and that's what made Wii games
look<00:02:29.920> so<00:02:30.130> horrible<00:02:30.730> in<00:02:31.030> most<00:02:31.240> HD<00:02:31.540> TVs<00:02:32.260> now<00:02:33.100> with

00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:33.310 
look so horrible in most HD TVs now with

00:02:33.310 --> 00:02:37.100 
look so horrible in most HD TVs now with
the<00:02:33.460> Wii<00:02:33.640> U<00:02:34.080> this<00:02:35.080> is<00:02:35.490> outputting<00:02:36.490> the

00:02:37.100 --> 00:02:37.110 
the Wii U this is outputting the

00:02:37.110 --> 00:02:40.950 
the Wii U this is outputting the
