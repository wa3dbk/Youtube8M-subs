00:02:17.850 --> 00:02:17.860 
said I bet he wishes there was a few

00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:19.650 
said I bet he wishes there was a few
races<00:02:18.040> left<00:02:18.370> he<00:02:18.550> could<00:02:18.760> run<00:02:18.880> that<00:02:19.060> Swift

00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:19.660 
races left he could run that Swift

00:02:19.660 --> 00:02:22.740

00:02:22.740 --> 00:02:22.750 
running it's officially a 100 meters and

00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:24.780 
running it's officially a 100 meters and
theoretically<00:02:23.350> this<00:02:24.130> would<00:02:24.370> count<00:02:24.670> for

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:24.790 
theoretically this would count for
