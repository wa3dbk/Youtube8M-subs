00:00:01.579 --> 00:00:01.589 
elevators get right down toward the

00:00:01.589 --> 00:00:03.560 
elevators get right down toward the
ground<00:00:01.680> so<00:00:02.129> sometimes<00:00:02.550> the<00:00:02.730> cars<00:00:02.939> are<00:00:03.300> not

00:00:05.240 --> 00:00:05.250 
good indicators of the tornado winds but

00:00:05.250 --> 00:00:07.369 
good indicators of the tornado winds but
the<00:00:05.490> data<00:00:05.700> can't<00:00:05.970> be<00:00:06.029> ignored<00:00:06.210> ef5<00:00:07.049> with<00:00:07.290> an

interesting<00:00:17.970> stuff<00:00:18.480> there<00:00:18.690> on<00:00:18.810> that<00:00:18.900> tornado

interesting stuff there on that tornado
let's<00:00:19.619> talk<00:00:19.830> about<00:00:20.010> the<00:00:20.310> southeast<00:00:20.880> we've

00:00:21.109 --> 00:00:21.119 
let's talk about the southeast we've

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:23.090 
let's talk about the southeast we've
been<00:00:21.300> kind<00:00:21.720> of<00:00:21.750> up<00:00:21.930> and<00:00:22.109> down<00:00:22.350> and<00:00:22.740> we're<00:00:23.039> gonna

00:00:23.090 --> 00:00:23.100 
been kind of up and down and we're gonna

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:24.950 
been kind of up and down and we're gonna
go<00:00:23.340> back<00:00:23.519> into<00:00:23.760> a<00:00:23.850> very<00:00:23.880> nice<00:00:24.180> pattern<00:00:24.539> and

00:00:24.950 --> 00:00:24.960 
go back into a very nice pattern and

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:27.320 
go back into a very nice pattern and

00:00:43.959 --> 00:00:43.969 
10 percent that's pretty good for

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:45.870 
Atlanta all right here's the Lando right

Atlanta all right here's the Lando right
now<00:00:45.989> not<00:00:46.200> much<00:00:46.230> going<00:00:46.559> on<00:00:46.649> a<00:00:46.680> few<00:00:46.860> showers<00:00:47.010> and

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:47.280 
now not much going on a few showers and

now not much going on a few showers and
storms<00:00:47.489> way<00:00:47.670> off<00:00:48.030> to<00:00:48.600> the<00:00:48.629> west<00:00:48.899> there<00:00:49.200> and<00:00:49.379> if

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:49.440 
storms way off to the west there and if

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:51.650 
storms way off to the west there and if
we<00:00:49.590> zoom<00:00:49.800> out<00:00:49.980> further<00:00:50.420> relatively<00:00:51.420> quiet

00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:51.660 
we zoom out further relatively quiet

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:54.170 
we zoom out further relatively quiet
there<00:00:51.960> is<00:00:52.050> a<00:00:52.079> front<00:00:52.559> moving<00:00:53.129> down<00:00:53.550> here<00:00:54.000> that

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:54.180 
there is a front moving down here that

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:55.760 
there is a front moving down here that
will<00:00:54.360> sweep<00:00:54.600> through<00:00:54.870> but<00:00:55.140> the<00:00:55.230> activity<00:00:55.680> on

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:55.770 
will sweep through but the activity on

00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:57.709 
will sweep through but the activity on
the<00:00:55.800> front<00:00:56.100> right<00:00:56.250> now<00:00:56.329> pretty<00:00:57.329> scattered

00:00:57.709 --> 00:00:57.719 
the front right now pretty scattered

00:00:57.719 --> 00:00:59.060 
the front right now pretty scattered
part<00:00:58.109> of<00:00:58.199> it<00:00:58.289> has<00:00:58.410> to<00:00:58.440> do<00:00:58.649> with<00:00:58.680> the<00:00:58.859> time<00:00:59.039> of

00:00:59.060 --> 00:00:59.070 
part of it has to do with the time of

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:00.799 
part of it has to do with the time of
night<00:00:59.309> it<00:00:59.460> is<00:00:59.579> a<00:00:59.609> lot<00:00:59.760> of<00:00:59.850> times<00:01:00.030> these<00:01:00.449> showers

00:01:00.799 --> 00:01:00.809 
night it is a lot of times these showers

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:02.180 
night it is a lot of times these showers
and<00:01:00.960> storms<00:01:01.230> are<00:01:01.350> driven<00:01:01.649> by<00:01:01.859> the<00:01:01.920> sunlight

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:02.190 
and storms are driven by the sunlight

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:04.189 
and storms are driven by the sunlight
and<00:01:02.489> then<00:01:02.609> they<00:01:02.699> kind<00:01:02.879> of<00:01:02.969> fade<00:01:03.149> out<00:01:03.180> as<00:01:03.539> the

00:01:04.189 --> 00:01:04.199 
and then they kind of fade out as the

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:06.410 
and then they kind of fade out as the
Sun<00:01:04.470> sets<00:01:05.220> so<00:01:05.549> that's<00:01:05.729> where<00:01:05.939> that<00:01:06.060> front<00:01:06.240> is

00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:06.420 
Sun sets so that's where that front is

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:08.179 
Sun sets so that's where that front is
right<00:01:06.570> there<00:01:06.720> towards<00:01:07.049> the<00:01:07.110> birmingham<00:01:07.950> area

00:01:08.179 --> 00:01:08.189 
right there towards the birmingham area

00:01:08.189 --> 00:01:10.250 
right there towards the birmingham area
and<00:01:08.400> sweeping<00:01:08.729> down<00:01:08.909> to<00:01:09.420> the<00:01:09.540> south<00:01:09.750> and<00:01:09.990> east

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:10.260 
and sweeping down to the south and east

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:11.630 
and sweeping down to the south and east
so<00:01:10.500> better<00:01:10.680> weather<00:01:10.920> as<00:01:11.100> this<00:01:11.250> cold<00:01:11.490> front

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:11.640 
so better weather as this cold front

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:13.730 
so better weather as this cold front
moves<00:01:11.880> off<00:01:12.119> to<00:01:12.510> the<00:01:12.630> southeast<00:01:13.140> eventually

00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:13.740 
moves off to the southeast eventually

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:15.740 
moves off to the southeast eventually
down<00:01:13.950> into<00:01:14.610> northern<00:01:15.030> Florida<00:01:15.479> and<00:01:15.570> a<00:01:15.600> big

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:15.750 
down into northern Florida and a big

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:17.539 
down into northern Florida and a big
ridge<00:01:15.930> of<00:01:16.080> high<00:01:16.229> pressure<00:01:16.259> builds<00:01:16.979> in<00:01:17.100> by

00:01:17.539 --> 00:01:17.549 
ridge of high pressure builds in by

00:01:17.549 --> 00:01:19.490 
ridge of high pressure builds in by
mid-week<00:01:18.000> with<00:01:18.270> a<00:01:18.299> bunch<00:01:18.540> of<00:01:18.659> dry<00:01:18.930> air<00:01:18.960> coming

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:19.500 
mid-week with a bunch of dry air coming

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:21.380 
mid-week with a bunch of dry air coming
with<00:01:19.770> it<00:01:20.009> and<00:01:20.189> that's<00:01:20.700> why<00:01:20.909> we're<00:01:21.119> gonna<00:01:21.210> get

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:21.390 
with it and that's why we're gonna get

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:22.640 
with it and that's why we're gonna get
into<00:01:21.540> a<00:01:21.630> pattern<00:01:21.900> where<00:01:22.140> it's<00:01:22.229> very<00:01:22.409> nice<00:01:22.619> for

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:22.650 
into a pattern where it's very nice for

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:24.460 
into a pattern where it's very nice for
Wednesday<00:01:23.220> Thursday<00:01:23.460> Friday<00:01:23.700> and<00:01:24.270> Saturday

00:01:24.460 --> 00:01:24.470 
Wednesday Thursday Friday and Saturday
