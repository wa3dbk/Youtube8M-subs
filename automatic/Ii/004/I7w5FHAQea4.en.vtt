00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.410
 just make a small card that is 

00:00:02.610 --> 00:00:06.330
 We'll see this differently. 

00:00:04.410 --> 00:00:08.910
 inside the block itself. 

00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:12.870
 China is going to start, we're going to get a 

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:15.680
 cache and will take the crown off 

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:19.439
 separated here in my little heart after 

00:00:15.680 --> 00:00:21.570
 take a box and remove the cover one 

00:00:19.439 --> 00:00:26.640
 little down you get 

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:28.230
 work then this cover will go 

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:32.610
 take a slice of that certainty that 

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:35.340
 world has a home and goes to work 

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:38.809
 It will be a cache to make it 

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:38.809
 It's kind of a cup. 

00:00:39.460 --> 00:00:42.549

 when you are arriving at the end but already 

00:00:52.640 --> 00:00:57.489
 I took a spoon to give help to 

00:00:55.040 --> 00:01:01.730
 to clean the bottom will look good 

00:00:57.489 --> 00:01:04.660
 so we already have a glass made 

00:01:01.730 --> 00:01:04.660
 of pineapple 

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:10.110
 Let's leave that pineapple glass already 

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:12.720
 separated here on the side and now let's 

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:14.790
 start working the caipi itself 

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:17.610
 We're going to get these pineapples that 

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:23.790
 People came inside the glass and we're going to give 

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:26.070
 a dried up in them now will take our 

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:31.230

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:40.500
 pineapple inside and let's add leaves 

00:01:31.230 --> 00:01:46.650
 fresh mint here in this cup already 

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:49.200
 have a little sugar and give a trap 

00:01:46.650 --> 00:01:52.710

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:56.250
 a little pineapple series also not 

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:58.380

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:01.430
 additional ice inside 

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:12.990
 So now we'll put the doses 

00:02:06.850 --> 00:02:12.990
 of vodka closes the shaker 

00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:18.549
 when you feel that the shaker 

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:21.280
 It's very cold, ready and it can already be 

00:02:18.549 --> 00:02:25.000
