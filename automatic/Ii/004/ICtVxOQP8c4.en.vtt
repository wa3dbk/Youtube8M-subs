implies<00:01:09.680> and<00:01:10.360> and<00:01:11.360> what<00:01:11.960> we<00:01:12.200> had<00:01:12.350> in<00:01:12.469> mind<00:01:12.499> was

00:01:12.969 --> 00:01:12.979 
implies and and what we had in mind was

00:01:12.979 --> 00:01:17.080 
implies and and what we had in mind was
to<00:01:13.189> give<00:01:13.460> the<00:01:14.409> 50<00:01:15.409> watt<00:01:15.609> combo<00:01:16.609> as<00:01:16.819> much

00:01:17.080 --> 00:01:17.090 
to give the 50 watt combo as much

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:19.629 
to give the 50 watt combo as much
Headroom<00:01:17.359> as<00:01:17.630> possible<00:01:18.229> out<00:01:18.950> of<00:01:19.100> 50<00:01:19.340> watts<00:01:19.520> a

00:01:19.629 --> 00:01:19.639 
Headroom as possible out of 50 watts a

00:01:19.639 --> 00:01:21.840 
Headroom as possible out of 50 watts a
tube<00:01:19.850> now<00:01:20.060> most<00:01:20.299> amplifiers<00:01:20.840> are<00:01:21.020> designed<00:01:21.380> to

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:21.850 
tube now most amplifiers are designed to

00:01:21.850 --> 00:01:24.609 
tube now most amplifiers are designed to
be<00:01:22.850> clean<00:01:23.210> and<00:01:23.539> then<00:01:23.810> when<00:01:23.959> you<00:01:24.049> push<00:01:24.259> it<00:01:24.409> break

00:01:24.609 --> 00:01:24.619 
be clean and then when you push it break

00:01:24.619 --> 00:01:27.279 
be clean and then when you push it break
up<00:01:24.649> but<00:01:25.369> we<00:01:25.700> increased<00:01:26.090> the<00:01:26.509> throughput<00:01:26.749> level

00:01:27.279 --> 00:01:27.289 
up but we increased the throughput level

00:01:27.289 --> 00:01:29.980 
up but we increased the throughput level
on<00:01:27.380> the<00:01:27.499> Sam<00:01:27.740> so<00:01:28.579> you<00:01:28.700> can<00:01:29.030> turn<00:01:29.359> it<00:01:29.420> up<00:01:29.630> crank

00:01:29.980 --> 00:01:29.990 
on the Sam so you can turn it up crank

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:32.770 
on the Sam so you can turn it up crank
it<00:01:30.170> up<00:01:30.259> and<00:01:30.499> still<00:01:30.889> hold<00:01:31.189> that<00:01:31.399> Headroom<00:01:31.969> which

00:01:32.770 --> 00:01:32.780 
it up and still hold that Headroom which

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:35.260 
it up and still hold that Headroom which
is<00:01:32.929> very<00:01:33.200> important<00:01:33.950> for<00:01:34.030> like<00:01:35.030> for<00:01:35.179> example

00:01:35.260 --> 00:01:35.270 
is very important for like for example

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:37.179 
is very important for like for example
the<00:01:35.659> guitar<00:01:35.929> that<00:01:35.959> you're<00:01:36.229> holding<00:01:36.380> which<00:01:36.979> has

00:03:06.270 --> 00:03:06.280 
amps out there you generally can't plug

00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:08.270 
amps out there you generally can't plug
an<00:03:06.400> arch<00:03:06.579> top<00:03:06.850> into<00:03:07.359> without<00:03:07.810> having

00:03:08.270 --> 00:03:08.280 
an arch top into without having

00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:11.520 
an arch top into without having
catastrophic<00:03:09.280> feedback<00:03:10.209> even<00:03:10.810> at<00:03:11.019> very<00:03:11.049> low

00:03:11.520 --> 00:03:11.530 
catastrophic feedback even at very low

00:03:11.530 --> 00:03:15.120 
catastrophic feedback even at very low
volume<00:03:11.829> so<00:03:12.489> you<00:03:13.180> know<00:03:13.299> having<00:03:13.859> that's<00:03:14.859> one

00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:15.130 
volume so you know having that's one

00:03:15.130 --> 00:03:16.740 
volume so you know having that's one
