00:02:43.590 --> 00:02:43.600 
can fire he's got pretty good South

00:02:43.600 --> 00:02:44.880 
can fire he's got pretty good South
there<00:02:43.810> he's<00:02:43.930> got<00:02:44.050> his<00:02:44.140> engineer<00:02:44.560> with<00:02:44.740> his

00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:44.890 
there he's got his engineer with his

00:02:44.890 --> 00:02:46.740 
there he's got his engineer with his
little<00:02:45.520> sentry<00:02:45.790> guns<00:02:45.970> so<00:02:46.270> he's<00:02:46.480> got<00:02:46.630> pretty
