00:03:32.380 --> 00:03:32.390 
a lot of pilots I don't think they went

00:03:32.390 --> 00:03:35.050 
a lot of pilots I don't think they went
fast<00:03:32.689> enough<00:03:33.049> not<00:03:33.290> too<00:03:33.469> many<00:03:33.590> guys<00:03:33.829> ever<00:03:34.129> got

00:03:35.050 --> 00:03:35.060 
fast enough not too many guys ever got

00:03:35.060 --> 00:03:39.420 
fast enough not too many guys ever got
hurt

put pretty good roll bars in there I

00:03:42.640 --> 00:03:44.610 
put pretty good roll bars in there I
don't<00:03:42.819> know<00:03:43.000> the<00:03:43.209> quality<00:03:43.690> of<00:03:43.810> the<00:03:43.900> steel<00:03:44.230> may

00:03:44.610 --> 00:03:44.620 
don't know the quality of the steel may

00:03:44.620 --> 00:03:46.320 
don't know the quality of the steel may
be<00:03:44.680> made<00:03:44.980> amount<00:03:45.250> of<00:03:45.340> old<00:03:45.489> bed<00:03:45.730> frames<00:03:46.090> or

00:03:46.320 --> 00:03:46.330 
be made amount of old bed frames or

00:03:46.330 --> 00:03:49.140 
be made amount of old bed frames or
something

00:03:49.140 --> 00:03:49.150 

00:03:49.150 --> 00:03:56.270 

yeah<00:03:49.629> good<00:03:49.900> clothes<00:03:50.170> racing

00:03:56.270 --> 00:03:56.280 

00:03:56.280 --> 00:03:59.150 

yeah<00:03:56.930> collectors<00:03:57.930> would<00:03:58.110> go<00:03:58.320> crazy<00:03:58.590> all<00:03:58.950> these

00:03:59.150 --> 00:03:59.160
