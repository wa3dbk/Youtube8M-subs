00:00:12.760 --> 00:00:14.980
Samshabati is a women's vocal ensemble. 

00:00:14.980 --> 00:00:17.600
We exclusively sing polyphony from Georgia.

00:00:19.960 --> 00:00:22.320
The group has existed for 6 and a half years 

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:27.500
and is based in Puy-de-Dôme, in central France.

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:31.080
We strive to make these songs known in our region,

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:33.140
mostly in Auvergne for now,

00:00:35.680 --> 00:00:38.460
but also sometimes farther away in France or abroad.

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:44.220
We take part in training sessions to learn new songs 

00:00:44.220 --> 00:00:46.260
I also organize my own sessions

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:48.080
to help others discover the Georgian repertoire,

00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:49.720
with great joy.

00:01:07.895 --> 00:01:10.435
Georgian singing isn't easy to define.

00:01:10.440 --> 00:01:12.160
One distinctive feature is 

00:01:12.160 --> 00:01:14.560
that it is a popular repertoire

00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:17.480
sung by the common people in Georgia,

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:22.920
not by music specialists only.

00:01:24.660 --> 00:01:26.920
The songs have been passed down

00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:29.860
from generation to generation for thousands of years.

00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:32.980
They were not arranged afterwards

00:01:34.494 --> 00:01:37.034
The songs were created orally

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:40.340
in polyphony.

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:42.760
This is oral tradition polyphony.

00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:45.740
We often meet people at our concerts

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:48.360
who hear this repertoire for the first time

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:50.920
and they usually react as we ourselves did.

00:01:51.900 --> 00:01:54.400
It is an astounding experience to discover

00:01:54.400 --> 00:01:56.440
this unknown music

00:01:56.440 --> 00:01:59.420
which is so rich, so varied, so moving…

00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:15.960
One may ask how legitimate it is for us

00:02:15.960 --> 00:02:17.800
to sing these songs,

00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:20.100
since none of us is Georgian.

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:24.220
People think that we choose to sing this repertoire

00:02:24.220 --> 00:02:25.680
because we have Georgian origins

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:27.680
but that's not the case.

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:29.900
We sing these songs

00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:31.520
simply because we love them. 

00:02:32.674 --> 00:02:34.674
We learn them in the oral tradition:

00:02:34.674 --> 00:02:36.243
 without scores,

00:02:36.243 --> 00:02:38.643
by immersion and imitiation

00:02:38.643 --> 00:02:40.923
reproducing what we hear.

00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:44.420
And we interpret them with our culture,

00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:46.860
our identity, our sensitivity.

00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:51.300
We try to stay as close as possible to the Georgian tradition,

00:02:52.460 --> 00:02:54.640
but we carry these songs our way

00:02:54.640 --> 00:02:56.220
in their journey

00:02:56.500 --> 00:02:58.000
from Georgia to France.
