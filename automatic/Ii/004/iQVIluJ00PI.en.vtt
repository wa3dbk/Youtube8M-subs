00:00:00.550 --> 00:00:05.930
 some to all tuberos to that the channel 

00:00:03.560 --> 00:00:08.149
 from daniel road master and I'm 

00:00:05.930 --> 00:00:10.670
 depositing a new video of how 

00:00:08.149 --> 00:00:18.770
 configure the optimum without action by 

00:00:10.670 --> 00:00:22.960
 physical cent and install it in the channel 

00:00:18.770 --> 00:00:22.960
 in the description the link 

00:00:23.690 --> 00:00:30.330
 but good the truth that works for 

00:00:26.180 --> 00:00:32.910
 me here 

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:37.370
 and those who charge us Spanish Spain 

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:37.370
 because I do video why 

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:42.739
 and let's go for it good 

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:52.879
 enjoy it 

00:01:02.829 --> 00:01:06.730
 with difficulty 

00:01:07.030 --> 00:01:12.690
 the music suddenly 250 

00:01:15.640 --> 00:01:20.670
 because 50 good because you hear very 

00:01:18.340 --> 00:01:20.670
 strong 

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:42.060
 fast graphic soft lighting I do not think 

00:01:34.420 --> 00:01:45.060
 that this question is clear fox for 

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:45.060
 decrease it 

00:01:47.800 --> 00:01:54.060
 details then we go to the animation of 

00:01:50.039 --> 00:01:56.560
 distance and equality out between 

00:01:54.060 --> 00:02:00.280
 maximum and 7 is worth everything has been the most 

00:01:56.560 --> 00:02:04.600
 vague but he recommend to quit but 

00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:06.970
 equal the most but in terms of the 

00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:10.140
 maximum fps is good to take with the car 

00:02:06.970 --> 00:02:15.340
 stories to you make him say four 

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:19.550
 guests 5 205 vision movements 

00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:22.740
 I do not know how the different term moves 

00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:29.300
 advanced open 

00:02:22.740 --> 00:02:35.040
 it's not there but everyone to have the 

00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:39.140
 quality of love of love and of healing is 

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:45.530
 the level of smoothing I do not admit peak no 

00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:45.530
 we put you to performance of off 

00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:49.820
 it is one more 

00:02:50.980 --> 00:02:54.120
 or they press you 

00:02:54.330 --> 00:03:05.400
 is not at stake this kind of paul is 

00:03:02.739 --> 00:03:05.400
 debut 

00:03:06.050 --> 00:03:13.070
 and after so many in this first phase 

00:03:11.330 --> 00:03:15.910
 after before 

00:03:13.070 --> 00:03:15.910
 low 

00:03:18.030 --> 00:03:27.880
 so that these fast facets pass fast 

00:03:23.950 --> 00:03:31.590
 fashion of pop or fast after they reach 

00:03:27.880 --> 00:03:43.240
 the last animation they go here to 

00:03:31.590 --> 00:03:47.920
 Package with 20 minimum particles 

00:03:43.240 --> 00:03:50.310
 and one that would be all channel and the video of 

00:03:47.920 --> 00:03:50.310
 tutorial 

00:03:55.800 --> 00:04:10.440
 but all and see you this video 

00:04:07.440 --> 00:04:10.440
 bye
