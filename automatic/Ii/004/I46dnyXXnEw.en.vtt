things with that for input and for

00:00:27.190 --> 00:00:28.980 
things with that for input and for
example<00:00:27.490> I'm<00:00:27.789> in<00:00:27.910> the<00:00:28.029> normal<00:00:28.390> channel<00:00:28.810> and

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:28.990 
example I'm in the normal channel and

example I'm in the normal channel and
I'm<00:00:29.740> in<00:00:29.980> the<00:00:30.130> low<00:00:30.310> input<00:00:30.820> of<00:00:30.939> the<00:00:31.029> normal

00:00:31.330 --> 00:00:32.819 
I'm in the low input of the normal

a very typical of the AC line there's a

00:00:58.839 --> 00:01:00.240 
a very typical of the AC line there's a
tone<00:00:59.079> cut<00:00:59.350> in<00:00:59.469> here<00:00:59.589> when<00:00:59.739> I<00:00:59.769> increase<00:01:00.100> the

00:01:00.240 --> 00:01:00.250 
tone cut in here when I increase the

00:01:00.250 --> 00:01:03.450 
tone cut in here when I increase the
tone<00:01:00.460> cut<00:01:00.760> I<00:01:00.969> can<00:01:01.539> kind<00:01:02.350> of<00:01:02.440> pad<00:01:02.739> the<00:01:02.979> high<00:01:03.190> end

00:01:03.450 --> 00:01:03.460 
tone cut I can kind of pad the high end

00:01:03.460 --> 00:01:05.009 
tone cut I can kind of pad the high end
and<00:01:03.609> the<00:01:03.670> higher<00:01:03.820> mid<00:01:04.059> frequencies<00:01:04.600> they're

00:01:05.009 --> 00:01:05.019 
and the higher mid frequencies they're

00:01:05.019 --> 00:01:20.570 
and the higher mid frequencies they're
getting<00:01:05.229> even<00:01:05.439> a<00:01:05.530> more<00:01:05.710> felt<00:01:06.070> like<00:01:06.280> warm<00:01:06.610> tone

I can plug into the high input of the

00:01:23.910 --> 00:01:26.900 
I can plug into the high input of the
normal<00:01:24.210> channel<00:01:24.630> and<00:01:25.440> get<00:01:26.070> that<00:01:26.190> traditional

00:03:30.150 --> 00:03:32.150 
boost Channel is also a very nice
channel<00:03:30.570> to<00:03:30.780> dial<00:03:31.020> in<00:03:31.260> a<00:03:31.440> little<00:03:31.860> bit<00:03:31.980> of<00:03:32.010> the

00:03:32.150 --> 00:03:32.160 
channel to dial in a little bit of the

00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:33.800 
channel to dial in a little bit of the
tremolo<00:03:32.430> now<00:03:32.760> the<00:03:32.820> tremolo<00:03:33.150> circuit<00:03:33.690> will

00:03:33.800 --> 00:03:33.810 
tremolo now the tremolo circuit will

00:03:33.810 --> 00:03:35.240 
tremolo now the tremolo circuit will
work<00:03:33.990> with<00:03:34.110> the<00:03:34.200> normal<00:03:34.530> and<00:03:34.680> the<00:03:34.710> top<00:03:34.950> boost

00:03:35.240 --> 00:03:35.250 
work with the normal and the top boost

00:03:35.250 --> 00:03:38.540 
work with the normal and the top boost
but<00:03:35.730> with<00:03:35.850> that<00:03:36.030> top-end<00:03:36.960> jangle<00:03:37.920> I<00:03:38.100> can

00:03:38.540 --> 00:03:38.550 
but with that top-end jangle I can

00:03:38.550 --> 00:03:39.920 
but with that top-end jangle I can
really<00:03:38.790> emulate<00:03:39.210> some<00:03:39.360> really<00:03:39.570> nice<00:03:39.750> stuff

00:03:39.920 --> 00:03:39.930 
really emulate some really nice stuff

00:03:39.930 --> 00:04:02.340 
really emulate some really nice stuff
check<00:03:40.710> out<00:03:40.830> the<00:03:40.890> tremolo<00:03:41.280> circuit

00:04:02.340 --> 00:04:02.350 

00:04:02.350 --> 00:04:17.219 

can<00:04:03.350> increase<00:04:03.680> the<00:04:03.860> speed

00:04:17.219 --> 00:04:17.229 

00:04:17.229 --> 00:04:19.719 

we're<00:04:18.229> also<00:04:18.380> running<00:04:18.949> through<00:04:19.280> the<00:04:19.400> reverb

00:04:19.719 --> 00:04:19.729 
we're also running through the reverb

00:04:19.729 --> 00:04:21.699 
we're also running through the reverb
circuits<00:04:20.239> so<00:04:20.449> in<00:04:20.780> essence<00:04:21.229> whether<00:04:21.440> you're<00:04:21.650> in

00:04:21.699 --> 00:04:21.709 
circuits so in essence whether you're in

00:04:21.709 --> 00:04:23.050 
circuits so in essence whether you're in
the<00:04:21.739> normal<00:04:21.979> channel<00:04:22.430> or<00:04:22.490> the<00:04:22.550> top<00:04:22.820> boost

00:04:23.050 --> 00:04:23.060 
the normal channel or the top boost

00:04:23.060 --> 00:04:26.140 
the normal channel or the top boost
channel<00:04:23.479> you<00:04:23.840> can<00:04:24.050> hit<00:04:24.260> the<00:04:24.919> channel<00:04:25.370> then<00:04:25.729> the

00:04:26.140 --> 00:04:26.150 
channel you can hit the channel then the

00:04:26.150 --> 00:04:29.320 
channel you can hit the channel then the
reverb<00:04:26.510> then<00:04:26.990> the<00:04:27.979> tremolo<00:04:28.250> circuit<00:04:28.850> the<00:04:29.090> tone

00:04:29.320 --> 00:04:29.330 
reverb then the tremolo circuit the tone

00:04:29.330 --> 00:04:31.540 
reverb then the tremolo circuit the tone
cut<00:04:29.540> and<00:04:29.720> finally<00:04:30.080> a<00:04:30.110> master<00:04:30.590> volume<00:04:30.770> the<00:04:31.340> cool

00:04:31.540 --> 00:04:31.550 
cut and finally a master volume the cool

00:04:31.550 --> 00:04:33.400 
cut and finally a master volume the cool
thing<00:04:31.760> there<00:04:31.940> is<00:04:32.090> I<00:04:32.210> can<00:04:32.389> dial<00:04:32.660> in<00:04:32.900> some<00:04:33.110> gain

00:04:33.400 --> 00:04:33.410 
thing there is I can dial in some gain

00:04:33.410 --> 00:04:35.920 
thing there is I can dial in some gain
for<00:04:33.949> example<00:04:34.370> I'll<00:04:34.520> dime<00:04:34.880> out<00:04:35.090> the<00:04:35.449> top<00:04:35.660> boost

00:04:35.920 --> 00:04:35.930 
for example I'll dime out the top boost

00:04:35.930 --> 00:04:37.990 
for example I'll dime out the top boost
channel<00:04:36.320> all<00:04:36.440> the<00:04:36.530> way<00:04:36.620> up<00:04:36.740> to<00:04:36.860> 10<00:04:37.100> and<00:04:37.400> I<00:04:37.850> can

00:04:37.990 --> 00:04:38.000 
channel all the way up to 10 and I can

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:40.300 
channel all the way up to 10 and I can
bring<00:04:38.210> down<00:04:38.389> the<00:04:38.780> master<00:04:39.260> volume<00:04:39.440> so<00:04:40.100> I<00:04:40.160> could

00:04:40.300 --> 00:04:40.310 
bring down the master volume so I could

00:04:40.310 --> 00:04:42.189 
bring down the master volume so I could
still<00:04:40.460> get<00:04:40.580> gain<00:04:40.820> at<00:04:41.030> a<00:04:41.090> low<00:04:41.270> volume<00:04:41.300> check<00:04:42.080> it

00:04:42.189 --> 00:04:42.199 
still get gain at a low volume check it

00:04:42.199 --> 00:04:52.750 
still get gain at a low volume check it
out

00:04:52.750 --> 00:04:52.760 

00:04:52.760 --> 00:04:54.880 

oh<00:04:52.790> I'll<00:04:53.720> get<00:04:53.870> that<00:04:54.050> same<00:04:54.290> tone<00:04:54.530> at<00:04:54.680> a<00:04:54.740> low

00:04:54.880 --> 00:04:54.890 
oh I'll get that same tone at a low

00:04:54.890 --> 00:05:10.589 
oh I'll get that same tone at a low
volume

00:05:10.589 --> 00:05:10.599 

00:05:10.599 --> 00:05:12.809 

being<00:05:11.259> the<00:05:11.439> musical<00:05:11.860> lamp<00:05:12.009> that<00:05:12.189> it<00:05:12.309> is<00:05:12.460> I<00:05:12.669> can

00:05:12.809 --> 00:05:12.819 
being the musical lamp that it is I can

00:05:12.819 --> 00:05:14.549 
being the musical lamp that it is I can
roll<00:05:12.999> down<00:05:13.149> that<00:05:13.330> volume<00:05:13.629> without<00:05:13.929> touching<00:05:14.319> a

00:05:14.549 --> 00:05:14.559 
roll down that volume without touching a

00:05:14.559 --> 00:05:17.820 
roll down that volume without touching a
knob<00:05:15.119> change<00:05:16.119> a<00:05:16.210> pickup<00:05:16.509> or<00:05:16.659> two<00:05:16.869> and<00:05:17.169> I<00:05:17.649> get<00:05:17.800> a

00:05:17.820 --> 00:05:17.830 
knob change a pickup or two and I get a

00:05:17.830 --> 00:05:39.379 
knob change a pickup or two and I get a
nice<00:05:18.009> clean<00:05:18.309> tone

00:05:39.379 --> 00:05:39.389 

00:05:39.389 --> 00:05:41.939
