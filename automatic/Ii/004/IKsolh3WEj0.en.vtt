chocolatey milky coffee goodness like I
said<00:04:36.580> before<00:04:36.729> this<00:04:37.120> is<00:04:37.350> reminiscent<00:04:38.350> to<00:04:38.620> me<00:04:38.710> of

00:04:38.909 --> 00:04:38.919 
said before this is reminiscent to me of

00:04:38.919 --> 00:04:42.330 
said before this is reminiscent to me of
a<00:04:39.190> lot<00:04:39.370> of<00:04:39.400> like<00:04:39.700> Porter's<00:04:40.600> that<00:04:40.780> I've<00:04:40.930> had<00:04:41.340> but

00:04:42.330 --> 00:04:42.340 
a lot of like Porter's that I've had but

00:04:42.340 --> 00:04:43.680 
a lot of like Porter's that I've had but
it's<00:04:42.520> also<00:04:42.669> like<00:04:42.910> cross<00:04:43.120> with<00:04:43.300> that<00:04:43.419> staff

00:04:43.680 --> 00:04:43.690 
it's also like cross with that staff

00:04:43.690 --> 00:04:45.840 
it's also like cross with that staff
because<00:04:44.020> it's<00:04:44.169> so<00:04:44.380> sweet<00:04:44.770> it's<00:04:45.130> not<00:04:45.280> cleanly

00:04:45.840 --> 00:04:45.850 
because it's so sweet it's not cleanly

00:04:45.850 --> 00:04:48.420 
because it's so sweet it's not cleanly
sweet<00:04:46.150> but<00:04:46.840> it's<00:04:47.050> definitely<00:04:47.860> a<00:04:47.890> sweet<00:04:48.039> milk

00:04:48.420 --> 00:04:48.430 
sweet but it's definitely a sweet milk

00:04:48.430 --> 00:04:50.070 
sweet but it's definitely a sweet milk
stout<00:04:48.640> there's<00:04:48.940> no<00:04:49.150> doubt<00:04:49.360> about<00:04:49.390> it<00:04:49.690> it's<00:04:49.990> a

00:04:50.070 --> 00:04:50.080 
stout there's no doubt about it it's a

00:04:50.080 --> 00:04:52.590

top-notch<00:04:50.710> sweet<00:04:51.070> milk<00:04:51.280> stout<00:04:51.550> not<00:04:52.210> a<00:04:52.240> bit

00:04:52.590 --> 00:04:52.600 
top-notch sweet milk stout not a bit

last<00:04:58.090> very<00:04:58.720> very<00:04:59.140> good<00:04:59.410> beer<00:04:59.680> and<00:04:59.880> it's

00:05:00.870 --> 00:05:00.880 
last very very good beer and it's

00:05:00.880 --> 00:05:02.790 
last very very good beer and it's
surprising<00:05:01.570> how<00:05:01.780> much<00:05:01.930> flavor<00:05:02.289> this<00:05:02.590> thing

00:05:02.790 --> 00:05:02.800 
surprising how much flavor this thing

00:05:02.800 --> 00:05:04.980 
surprising how much flavor this thing
packs<00:05:03.100> for<00:05:03.610> a<00:05:03.669> four<00:05:03.910> point<00:05:04.180> nine<00:05:04.360> percent<00:05:04.390> beer

packs for a four point nine percent beer

00:05:04.990 --> 00:05:06.779 
packs for a four point nine percent beer
so<00:05:05.229> that's<00:05:05.410> before<00:05:05.650> this<00:05:05.770> isn't<00:05:05.979> proof<00:05:06.160> that

00:05:06.779 --> 00:05:06.789 
so that's before this isn't proof that

00:05:06.789 --> 00:05:09.060 
so that's before this isn't proof that
session<00:05:07.240> beaters<00:05:07.720> can<00:05:08.110> have<00:05:08.530> a<00:05:08.560> lot<00:05:08.740> of<00:05:08.860> taste

00:05:09.060 --> 00:05:09.070
