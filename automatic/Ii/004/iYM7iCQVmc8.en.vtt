00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.890
 Yes joan and never finished the novel 

00:00:03.149 --> 00:00:07.850
 I thought he was going to die today is 

00:00:04.890 --> 00:00:07.850
 wait for me a little while 

00:00:10.269 --> 00:00:14.400
 and we can also see each other 

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:36.990
 and that all my friends as they walk I am 

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:39.240
 talent and I bring you a new arona clip 

00:00:36.990 --> 00:00:41.670
 clichÃ© is a truth of a very very thing 

00:00:39.240 --> 00:00:43.559
 good and epic that is the way god in 

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:45.300
 big favor online and how can you see 

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:47.880
 my leagues is amazing because neither the 

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:49.470
 police or nothing will be able to kill us what 

00:00:47.880 --> 00:00:51.300
 that we are going to need my blacks is 

00:00:49.470 --> 00:00:53.280
 buy a cheap garage and that we 

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:55.379
 let's look at who we have average 

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:57.960
 block you are and we put here a 

00:00:55.379 --> 00:01:02.010
 ascendant and the courage that we should 

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:04.500
 buy is this 29 thousand 500 dollars ok 

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:06.180
 when they grab this hook of 29 thousand 500 

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:08.970
 dollars is what it is like to look like 

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:11.220
 nietzsche and is and was half patched 

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:13.200
 for rockstar but not quite not me 

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:15.110
 it came to me years so my friend tito 

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:17.250
 ronaldo was he who discovered how 

00:01:15.110 --> 00:01:19.140
 do it so that you always leave 

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:20.970
 first so thanks to them means 

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:22.920
 they will know that it is not down here that 

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:24.210
 thanks to him I brought this cliche to them 

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:26.010
 teach what they are getting ready for 

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:27.240
 always always come out because the 

00:01:26.010 --> 00:01:29.400
 truth is that stevi is very typical 

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:32.610
 we would need to stretch angels 

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:34.350
 the internal environment and what we're going to 

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:37.170
 to do is to turn around as they saw there 

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:39.060
 we turn around and once there we give it and then 

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:40.950
 after we join, we disconnect the 

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:43.470
 control and when we reconnect 

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:46.020
 our control is already going to be done this 

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:48.240
 eclipses black and will be ready the 

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:50.000
 truth is that it is super super simple what 

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:52.260
 that they need as I told them is 

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:54.300
 just when they enter your garage there 

00:01:52.260 --> 00:01:57.060
 move for nothing at all move 

00:01:54.300 --> 00:01:58.800
 and they just turn around they turn around and 

00:01:57.060 --> 00:02:00.600
 they touch her and when her first 

00:01:58.800 --> 00:02:02.850
 legs and the car disconnected and 

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:04.410
 control they reconnect and ready 

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:05.610
 it's amazing then they're going to appear here and 

00:02:04.410 --> 00:02:07.710
 if they have they can be run over 

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:09.330
 they can get less of what is for 

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:11.160
 you check integrating them low lives nothing 

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:12.810
 and then they can do all the disaster 

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:14.730
 who want my leaders can chat 

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:16.410
 about the end of the novel so glory 

00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:19.050
 level dying that flight was not very 

00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:21.330
 good that I put it so try not to 

00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:23.790
 truth is incredible I hope I hope it does not go away 

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:26.070
 way update 1.16 because yes 

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:27.600
