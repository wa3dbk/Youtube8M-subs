00:01:42.230 --> 00:01:42.240 
and the answer is yes however if I fry

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:44.120 
and the answer is yes however if I fry
fish<00:01:42.299> or<00:01:42.899> shrimp<00:01:43.110> I<00:01:43.409> like<00:01:43.590> to<00:01:43.710> keep<00:01:43.829> it<00:01:43.979> in<00:01:44.070> a

00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:44.130 
fish or shrimp I like to keep it in a

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:46.999 
fish or shrimp I like to keep it in a
container<00:01:44.640> labeled<00:01:45.030> seafood<00:01:45.689> oil<00:01:45.899> if<00:01:46.470> I<00:01:46.770> fried

00:01:46.999 --> 00:01:47.009 
container labeled seafood oil if I fried

00:01:47.009 --> 00:01:48.170 
container labeled seafood oil if I fried
chicken<00:01:47.369> or<00:01:47.460> anything<00:01:47.880> else

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:48.180 
chicken or anything else

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:49.999 
chicken or anything else
then<00:01:48.360> I<00:01:48.540> won't<00:01:48.869> label<00:01:49.200> it<00:01:49.350> it'll<00:01:49.710> just<00:01:49.740> be

00:01:49.999 --> 00:01:50.009 
then I won't label it it'll just be

00:01:50.009 --> 00:01:52.130 
then I won't label it it'll just be
regular<00:01:50.369> oil<00:01:50.520> and<00:01:51.270> the<00:01:51.360> reason<00:01:51.689> why<00:01:51.780> I<00:01:51.840> like<00:01:52.020> to

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:52.140 
regular oil and the reason why I like to

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:54.050 
regular oil and the reason why I like to
separate<00:01:52.530> the<00:01:52.680> seafood<00:01:53.070> oil<00:01:53.310> is<00:01:53.549> because<00:01:53.880> I

00:01:54.050 --> 00:01:54.060 
separate the seafood oil is because I

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:55.910 
separate the seafood oil is because I
once<00:01:54.329> fried<00:01:54.570> something<00:01:55.140> and<00:01:55.350> it<00:01:55.439> had<00:01:55.470> a<00:01:55.590> fishy

00:01:55.910 --> 00:01:55.920 
once fried something and it had a fishy

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:58.010 
once fried something and it had a fishy
taste<00:01:56.040> and<00:01:56.610> then<00:01:57.240> I<00:01:57.270> remember<00:01:57.750> that<00:01:57.869> I<00:01:57.930> had

00:01:58.010 --> 00:01:58.020 
taste and then I remember that I had

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:00.469 
taste and then I remember that I had
fried<00:01:58.469> fish<00:01:58.860> the<00:01:59.100> week<00:01:59.250> before<00:01:59.490> in<00:01:59.969> the<00:02:00.299> same

00:02:00.469 --> 00:02:00.479 
fried fish the week before in the same

00:02:00.479 --> 00:02:03.020 
fried fish the week before in the same
oil<00:02:00.630> so<00:02:01.320> ever<00:02:01.530> since<00:02:01.799> I<00:02:02.070> like<00:02:02.310> to<00:02:02.460> separate<00:02:02.850> it

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:03.030 
oil so ever since I like to separate it

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:05.810 
oil so ever since I like to separate it
so<00:02:03.719> I<00:02:03.750> hope<00:02:04.049> that<00:02:04.079> helps<00:02:04.619> now<00:02:05.430> for<00:02:05.640> the<00:02:05.700> honey
