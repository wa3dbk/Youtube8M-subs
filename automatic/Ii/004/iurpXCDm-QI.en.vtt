00:00:04.519 --> 00:00:04.529 
hey everyone its mark I'm out on the

00:00:04.529 --> 00:00:08.330 
hey everyone its mark I'm out on the
river<00:00:04.740> and<00:00:05.660> I<00:00:06.660> found<00:00:07.020> another<00:00:07.140> easy<00:00:07.680> panning

00:00:08.330 --> 00:00:08.340 
river and I found another easy panning

00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:13.580 
river and I found another easy panning
spot<00:00:10.309> this<00:00:11.309> is<00:00:11.370> a<00:00:11.580> spot<00:00:12.000> that's<00:00:12.269> got<00:00:12.590> some

00:00:13.580 --> 00:00:13.590 
spot this is a spot that's got some

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:16.849 
spot this is a spot that's got some
erosion<00:00:13.950> that<00:00:14.820> I<00:00:14.849> noticed<00:00:15.299> right<00:00:15.599> here<00:00:16.080> at<00:00:16.260> the

00:00:16.849 --> 00:00:16.859 
erosion that I noticed right here at the

00:00:16.859 --> 00:00:19.279 
erosion that I noticed right here at the
edge<00:00:17.039> you<00:00:17.609> can<00:00:18.180> see<00:00:18.359> the<00:00:18.480> creeks<00:00:18.750> right<00:00:18.960> here

00:00:19.279 --> 00:00:19.289 
edge you can see the creeks right here

00:00:19.289 --> 00:00:21.590 
edge you can see the creeks right here
and<00:00:19.470> I've<00:00:20.039> gone<00:00:20.220> along<00:00:20.520> all<00:00:20.850> through<00:00:21.420> this

00:00:21.590 --> 00:00:21.600 
and I've gone along all through this

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:25.400 
and I've gone along all through this
edge<00:00:21.869> and<00:00:22.380> I<00:00:23.130> sample<00:00:23.699> and<00:00:24.109> there's<00:00:25.109> a<00:00:25.170> couple

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:25.410 
edge and I sample and there's a couple

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:27.890 
edge and I sample and there's a couple
of<00:00:25.590> spots<00:00:25.920> where<00:00:26.250> you<00:00:26.609> have<00:00:27.180> this<00:00:27.300> hard<00:00:27.599> pack

00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:27.900 
of spots where you have this hard pack

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:31.490 
of spots where you have this hard pack
that's<00:00:28.170> just<00:00:28.349> kind<00:00:28.529> of<00:00:28.590> breaking<00:00:29.039> up<00:00:30.500> this

00:00:31.490 --> 00:00:31.500 
that's just kind of breaking up this

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:34.130 
that's just kind of breaking up this
beautiful<00:00:31.949> hard<00:00:32.460> pack<00:00:32.759> beautiful<00:00:33.690> beautiful

00:00:34.130 --> 00:00:34.140 
beautiful hard pack beautiful beautiful

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:37.280 
beautiful hard pack beautiful beautiful
hard<00:00:34.320> package<00:00:34.800> and<00:00:35.010> you'll<00:00:35.550> see<00:00:35.820> some<00:00:36.290> some

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:37.290 
hard package and you'll see some some

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:39.700 
hard package and you'll see some some
rust<00:00:37.559> lines<00:00:37.829> these<00:00:38.219> are<00:00:38.280> great<00:00:38.850> indicators

00:00:39.700 --> 00:00:39.710 
rust lines these are great indicators

00:00:39.710 --> 00:00:43.490 
rust lines these are great indicators
that<00:00:40.710> you<00:00:41.219> found<00:00:41.550> the<00:00:42.360> bottom<00:00:42.780> and<00:00:42.960> there's

00:00:43.490 --> 00:00:43.500 
that you found the bottom and there's

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:47.869 
that you found the bottom and there's
gold<00:00:43.829> there<00:00:45.530> right<00:00:46.530> here<00:00:46.829> all<00:00:47.129> that<00:00:47.340> hard<00:00:47.610> pack

00:00:47.869 --> 00:00:47.879 
gold there right here all that hard pack

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:51.049 
gold there right here all that hard pack
all<00:00:48.510> those<00:00:48.780> cobbles<00:00:49.289> stop<00:00:49.680> so<00:00:50.399> what<00:00:50.910> I've<00:00:51.030> been

00:00:51.049 --> 00:00:51.059 
all those cobbles stop so what I've been

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:54.830 
all those cobbles stop so what I've been
doing<00:00:51.270> it's<00:00:52.230> illegal<00:00:53.270> to<00:00:54.270> work<00:00:54.480> on<00:00:54.690> this

00:00:54.830 --> 00:00:54.840 
doing it's illegal to work on this

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:57.770 
doing it's illegal to work on this
erosion<00:00:55.469> and<00:00:55.680> take<00:00:56.309> it<00:00:56.489> up<00:00:56.640> you<00:00:57.149> can't<00:00:57.420> do<00:00:57.600> that

00:00:57.770 --> 00:00:57.780 
erosion and take it up you can't do that

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:01.220 
erosion and take it up you can't do that
in<00:00:57.930> this<00:00:58.079> area<00:00:58.410> but<00:00:58.949> what<00:00:59.070> I'm<00:00:59.160> doing<00:00:59.219> is<00:01:00.230> I'm

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:01.230 
in this area but what I'm doing is I'm

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:05.060 
in this area but what I'm doing is I'm
sampling<00:01:02.149> below<00:01:03.149> the<00:01:03.390> high-water<00:01:03.750> mark<00:01:04.140> along

00:01:05.060 --> 00:01:05.070 
sampling below the high-water mark along

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:10.219 
sampling below the high-water mark along
this<00:01:05.220> edge<00:01:06.140> in<00:01:08.270> impanel<00:01:09.270> and<00:01:09.479> I<00:01:09.659> found<00:01:09.930> some

00:01:10.219 --> 00:01:10.229 
this edge in impanel and I found some

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:12.920 
this edge in impanel and I found some
really<00:01:10.920> big<00:01:11.729> pieces<00:01:12.060> wash<00:01:12.390> and<00:01:12.600> say<00:01:12.689> really

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:12.930 
really big pieces wash and say really

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:16.039 
really big pieces wash and say really
big<00:01:13.200> but<00:01:13.439> they're<00:01:13.890> bigger<00:01:14.310> pieces<00:01:14.820> than<00:01:15.720> I<00:01:15.840> did

00:01:16.039 --> 00:01:16.049 
big but they're bigger pieces than I did

00:01:16.049 --> 00:01:19.850 
big but they're bigger pieces than I did
earlier<00:01:17.240> so<00:01:18.240> these<00:01:18.720> pieces<00:01:19.020> are<00:01:19.320> pretty

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:19.860 
earlier so these pieces are pretty

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:22.640 
earlier so these pieces are pretty
pretty<00:01:20.759> decent<00:01:21.270> over<00:01:21.450> here<00:01:21.630> they're<00:01:22.409> bigger

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:22.650 
pretty decent over here they're bigger

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:26.120 
pretty decent over here they're bigger
flakes<00:01:24.170> and<00:01:25.170> that's<00:01:25.350> encouraging

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:26.130 
flakes and that's encouraging

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:32.120 
flakes and that's encouraging
so<00:01:26.790> I<00:01:27.770> just<00:01:28.770> wanted<00:01:29.070> to<00:01:29.159> show<00:01:29.400> you<00:01:29.659> that

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:32.130 
so I just wanted to show you that

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:34.190 
so I just wanted to show you that
there<00:01:32.820> are<00:01:33.000> other<00:01:33.270> places<00:01:33.600> that<00:01:33.869> you<00:01:33.930> could

00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:34.200 
there are other places that you could

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:36.230 
there are other places that you could
pan<00:01:34.590> and<00:01:35.399> you<00:01:35.520> don't<00:01:35.670> always<00:01:35.789> have<00:01:36.060> to<00:01:36.119> go

00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:36.240 
pan and you don't always have to go

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:37.700 
pan and you don't always have to go
right<00:01:36.509> in<00:01:36.630> the<00:01:36.659> middle<00:01:36.719> of<00:01:36.990> the<00:01:37.049> river<00:01:37.259> or

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:37.710 
right in the middle of the river or

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:40.670 
right in the middle of the river or
behind<00:01:38.399> that<00:01:38.610> one<00:01:38.820> rock<00:01:39.170> you<00:01:40.170> could<00:01:40.289> look<00:01:40.500> for

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:40.680 
behind that one rock you could look for

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:43.550 
behind that one rock you could look for
places<00:01:40.920> that<00:01:41.130> have<00:01:41.460> good<00:01:42.000> erosion<00:01:42.600> and<00:01:42.780> not

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:43.560 
places that have good erosion and not

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:45.770 
places that have good erosion and not
take<00:01:43.829> up<00:01:44.009> that<00:01:44.159> erosion<00:01:44.520> because<00:01:45.179> you'll<00:01:45.630> get

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:45.780 
take up that erosion because you'll get

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:47.090 
take up that erosion because you'll get
busted<00:01:45.990> you'll<00:01:46.350> get<00:01:46.470> fine<00:01:46.740> and<00:01:46.950> it's

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:47.100 
busted you'll get fine and it's

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:48.380 
busted you'll get fine and it's
definitely<00:01:47.399> not<00:01:47.579> worth<00:01:47.789> it<00:01:47.909> if<00:01:48.030> you<00:01:48.119> do<00:01:48.240> that

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:48.390 
definitely not worth it if you do that

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:49.249 
definitely not worth it if you do that
and<00:01:48.539> it's<00:01:48.630> not<00:01:48.780> good<00:01:48.929> for<00:01:48.960> the<00:01:49.170> environment

00:01:49.249 --> 00:01:49.259 
and it's not good for the environment

00:01:49.259 --> 00:01:52.730 
and it's not good for the environment
just<00:01:49.829> go<00:01:50.700> along<00:01:50.909> this<00:01:51.090> edge<00:01:51.360> and<00:01:51.689> you<00:01:52.590> can

00:01:52.730 --> 00:01:52.740 
just go along this edge and you can

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:54.399 
just go along this edge and you can
sample<00:01:53.009> you'll<00:01:53.310> probably<00:01:53.429> find<00:01:53.670> a<00:01:53.819> a

00:01:54.399 --> 00:01:54.409 
sample you'll probably find a a

00:01:54.409 --> 00:01:56.210 
sample you'll probably find a a
concentration<00:01:55.409> right<00:01:55.710> there<00:01:55.890> there's<00:01:56.100> some

00:01:56.210 --> 00:01:56.220 
concentration right there there's some

00:01:56.220 --> 00:01:58.850 
concentration right there there's some
kind<00:01:56.429> of<00:01:56.520> hard<00:01:57.509> pack<00:01:57.780> rubble<00:01:58.319> right<00:01:58.530> there<00:01:58.740> and

00:01:58.850 --> 00:01:58.860 
kind of hard pack rubble right there and

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:00.889 
kind of hard pack rubble right there and
I<00:01:58.920> sampled<00:01:59.399> in<00:01:59.490> here<00:01:59.729> and<00:01:59.850> and<00:02:00.000> that's<00:02:00.689> where

00:02:00.889 --> 00:02:00.899 
I sampled in here and and that's where

00:02:00.899 --> 00:02:02.840 
I sampled in here and and that's where
I'm<00:02:01.020> finding<00:02:01.200> those<00:02:01.619> larger<00:02:02.189> pieces<00:02:02.460> because

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:02.850 
I'm finding those larger pieces because

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:04.309 
I'm finding those larger pieces because
they<00:02:02.970> can't<00:02:03.179> go<00:02:03.390> anywhere<00:02:03.630> they're<00:02:03.899> stopping

00:02:04.309 --> 00:02:04.319 
they can't go anywhere they're stopping

00:02:04.319 --> 00:02:07.219 
they can't go anywhere they're stopping
right<00:02:04.439> there<00:02:04.500> so<00:02:05.780> that's<00:02:06.780> it<00:02:07.020> right<00:02:07.170> there

00:02:07.219 --> 00:02:07.229 
right there so that's it right there

00:02:07.229 --> 00:02:09.979 
right there so that's it right there
folks<00:02:07.649> hopefully<00:02:08.549> this<00:02:08.729> helps<00:02:09.000> you<00:02:09.119> on<00:02:09.390> some

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:09.989 
folks hopefully this helps you on some

00:02:09.989 --> 00:02:13.490 
folks hopefully this helps you on some
more<00:02:10.140> easy<00:02:10.440> pan<00:02:10.830> and<00:02:11.009> techniques<00:02:11.819> and<00:02:12.500> where

00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:13.500 
more easy pan and techniques and where

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:15.800 
more easy pan and techniques and where
to<00:02:13.620> locate<00:02:14.069> gold<00:02:14.640> so<00:02:14.970> pay<00:02:15.209> attention<00:02:15.599> to<00:02:15.690> my
