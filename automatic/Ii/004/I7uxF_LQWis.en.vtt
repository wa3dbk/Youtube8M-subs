don't know but I feel like that that's
best<00:02:36.250> just<00:02:36.549> a<00:02:36.610> little<00:02:36.790> bit<00:02:36.909> more

00:02:47.690 --> 00:02:47.700 

00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:52.700 

the<00:02:48.060> ends<00:02:48.480> of<00:02:48.600> my<00:02:48.750> hair<00:02:49.730> they<00:02:50.730> don't<00:02:51.120> get<00:02:51.710> dried

00:02:52.700 --> 00:02:52.710 
the ends of my hair they don't get dried

00:02:52.710 --> 00:02:55.790 
the ends of my hair they don't get dried
out<00:02:52.890> before<00:02:53.760> telling<00:02:54.360> me<00:02:54.480> that<00:02:54.690> a<00:02:54.720> lot<00:02:55.020> that<00:02:55.620> my

00:02:55.790 --> 00:02:55.800 
out before telling me that a lot that my

00:02:55.800 --> 00:02:58.960 
out before telling me that a lot that my
the<00:02:56.520> ends<00:02:56.760> of<00:02:56.820> my<00:02:56.940> hair<00:02:56.970> are<00:02:57.360> really<00:02:58.050> dried<00:02:58.320> out

00:02:58.960 --> 00:02:58.970 
the ends of my hair are really dried out

00:02:58.970 --> 00:03:01.130 
the ends of my hair are really dried out
is<00:02:59.970> that<00:03:00.270> right

00:03:01.130 --> 00:03:01.140 
is that right

00:03:01.140 --> 00:03:03.320 
is that right
I<00:03:01.170> also<00:03:01.740> don't<00:03:02.010> know<00:03:02.130> whether<00:03:02.940> they're

00:03:03.320 --> 00:03:03.330 
I also don't know whether they're

00:03:03.330 --> 00:03:05.750 
I also don't know whether they're
telling<00:03:03.660> me<00:03:03.840> to<00:03:03.930> cut<00:03:04.380> to<00:03:05.220> trim<00:03:05.460> the<00:03:05.580> hair

00:03:05.750 --> 00:03:05.760 
telling me to cut to trim the hair

00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:10.160 
telling me to cut to trim the hair
because<00:03:06.030> of<00:03:06.120> that<00:03:08.090> also<00:03:09.090> to<00:03:09.150> prevent<00:03:09.450> split

00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:10.170 
because of that also to prevent split

00:03:10.170 --> 00:03:12.410 
because of that also to prevent split
ends<00:03:10.590> and<00:03:10.740> things<00:03:11.580> like<00:03:11.730> that<00:03:11.880> not<00:03:12.090> prevent

00:03:12.410 --> 00:03:12.420 
ends and things like that not prevent

00:03:12.420 --> 00:03:15.430 
ends and things like that not prevent
but<00:03:12.570> take<00:03:13.320> them<00:03:13.440> off<00:03:13.620> and<00:03:14.100> I<00:03:15.000> really<00:03:15.210> don't

00:03:15.430 --> 00:03:15.440 
but take them off and I really don't

00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:17.300 
but take them off and I really don't
want<00:03:16.440> to<00:03:16.500> do<00:03:16.590> that<00:03:16.740> right<00:03:16.950> now

00:03:17.300 --> 00:03:17.310 
want to do that right now

00:03:17.310 --> 00:03:20.300 
want to do that right now
so<00:03:17.700> I<00:03:18.170> use<00:03:19.170> that<00:03:19.200> bow<00:03:19.530> made<00:03:19.680> and<00:03:19.890> I<00:03:19.950> think<00:03:19.980> it

00:03:20.300 --> 00:03:20.310 
so I use that bow made and I think it

00:03:20.310 --> 00:03:24.170 
so I use that bow made and I think it
works<00:03:20.730> just<00:03:21.300> fine<00:03:21.920> so<00:03:22.920> now<00:03:23.130> it's<00:03:23.580> the<00:03:23.880> part

00:03:24.170 --> 00:03:24.180 
works just fine so now it's the part

00:03:24.180 --> 00:03:26.860 
works just fine so now it's the part
where<00:03:24.450> people<00:03:24.480> are<00:03:25.140> probably<00:03:25.470> going<00:03:25.920> to
