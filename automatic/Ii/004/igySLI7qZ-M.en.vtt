00:00:05.540 --> 00:00:07.690

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:14.400
 if susana trivÃ©s image consultant and 

00:00:12.390 --> 00:00:16.290
 face- down personal shopper today I'm 

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:18.510
 here to tell you how you can change 

00:00:16.290 --> 00:00:20.700
 a look with the style of ning to be 

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:22.830
 totally glamorous and elegant to be 

00:00:20.700 --> 00:00:24.630
 much more casual and informal we are going to 

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:26.040
 do with two types of garments one that 

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:27.869
 is the one I wear now with the shirt and 

00:00:26.040 --> 00:00:30.900
 the jeans and another with a 

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:32.879
 dress let's see it how do you know the 

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:34.920
 cowboy style or better known as tennis 

00:00:32.879 --> 00:00:36.900
 lately it is one of the tendencies of 

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:38.550
 this season the best you have is 

00:00:36.900 --> 00:00:40.260
 that you will find all kinds of garments 

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:42.390
 from short skirts to long skirts 

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:44.880
 skinny jeans 

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:46.710
 pirates absolutely everything as you see 

00:00:44.880 --> 00:00:48.360
 right now I'm wearing jeans in the 

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:50.340
 navy blue color because it uses a lot 

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:52.500
 plus the figure combined with a shirt 

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:54.660
 cowgirl what I've done to give a lot 

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:56.550
 more shape to my silhouette is to put a 

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:58.649
 belt that defines completely in my 

00:00:56.550 --> 00:01:00.210
 waist and combine it with some shoes 

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:01.960
 high heel so he can do much more 

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:05.820
 slender leg 

00:01:01.960 --> 00:01:05.820
 Well let's change the place to the same 

00:01:06.190 --> 00:01:10.510
 only with a chas and I changed 

00:01:08.620 --> 00:01:12.670
 just look at what we have done 

00:01:10.510 --> 00:01:14.590
 been removing the belt as you see now 

00:01:12.670 --> 00:01:16.210
 the look is much more informal is 

00:01:14.590 --> 00:01:18.250
 left the shirt open however 

00:01:16.210 --> 00:01:20.290
 still holding the shirt and the 

00:01:18.250 --> 00:01:22.270
 jeans that I wore before the touch that 

00:01:20.290 --> 00:01:24.670
 really gives the change to styling is 

00:01:22.270 --> 00:01:25.840
 the bag before I would have taken 

00:01:24.670 --> 00:01:27.010
 I was carrying a bag that I had brought 

00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:28.720
 any other that was much more 

00:01:27.010 --> 00:01:29.950
 arranged and much more formal to match 

00:01:28.720 --> 00:01:31.540
 probably with the shoes that 

00:01:29.950 --> 00:01:33.520
 I would carry something a bag that is 

00:01:31.540 --> 00:01:36.010
 totally trend this season that 

00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:37.720
 is with the fringes the high fringes of the 

00:01:36.010 --> 00:01:39.970
 Western style they go until you find them 

00:01:37.720 --> 00:01:41.650
 in many clothes and accessories and 

00:01:39.970 --> 00:01:44.230
 what better than combining it with style 

00:01:41.650 --> 00:01:45.670
 cowboy as you see another of the parts that 

00:01:44.230 --> 00:01:47.140
 changed have simply been the 

00:01:45.670 --> 00:01:48.940
 shoes what I have done has been 

00:01:47.140 --> 00:01:50.590
 replace high-heeled shoes with 

00:01:48.940 --> 00:01:52.630
 Sandals asks with a lot 

00:01:50.590 --> 00:01:54.010
 wider and comfortable you can also 

00:01:52.630 --> 00:01:56.350
 Take for example with some dancers 

00:01:54.010 --> 00:01:58.730
 a more comfortable shoe if it's your case that 

00:01:56.350 --> 00:02:00.410
 you like to go a little flatter 

00:01:58.730 --> 00:02:02.210
 now let's do the same thing we're going to 

00:02:00.410 --> 00:02:04.280
 change the look by changing just two 

00:02:02.210 --> 00:02:08.340
 accessories belt and shoes 

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:11.009
 with simply this cowboy dress 

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:12.989
 you see it change a lot to take a 

00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:14.640
 complement or another with the previous 

00:02:12.989 --> 00:02:16.290
 complement that was the belt type 

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:17.879
 pajÃ­n me finishes much more the waist 

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:20.430
 now that a much more casual look 

00:02:17.879 --> 00:02:22.080
 with a belt to the hip also that 

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:24.390
 it carries the fringes that carry so much 

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:26.280
 this year with a lot more style 

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:28.019
 bohemian chic plus very important 

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:30.030
 use the sandals that we have 

00:02:28.019 --> 00:02:32.220
 previously used that you too 

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:35.510
 as I was saying you can use a shoe 

00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:35.510
 flatter if you prefer
