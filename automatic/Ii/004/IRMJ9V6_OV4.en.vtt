00:04:32.169 --> 00:04:34.379 
in fact some people even use MakerBot's
to<00:04:32.770> do<00:04:32.950> manufacturing<00:04:33.729> and<00:04:33.849> they<00:04:33.910> make<00:04:34.120> stuff

00:04:34.379 --> 00:04:34.389 
to do manufacturing and they make stuff

00:04:34.389 --> 00:04:37.200 
to do manufacturing and they make stuff
and<00:04:34.599> they<00:04:35.110> do<00:04:35.620> kind<00:04:36.039> of<00:04:36.099> runs<00:04:36.370> of<00:04:36.610> a<00:04:36.729> thousand

00:04:37.200 --> 00:04:37.210 
and they do kind of runs of a thousand

00:04:37.210 --> 00:04:39.360 
and they do kind of runs of a thousand
or<00:04:37.300> a<00:04:37.330> couple<00:04:37.660> thousand<00:04:38.110> things<00:04:38.260> and<00:04:38.560> so<00:04:38.680> on

00:04:39.360 --> 00:04:39.370 
or a couple thousand things and so on

00:04:39.370 --> 00:04:42.390 
or a couple thousand things and so on
so<00:04:39.970> for<00:04:40.690> me<00:04:40.870> it's<00:04:41.110> about<00:04:41.280> empowering<00:04:42.280> people

00:04:42.390 --> 00:04:42.400 
so for me it's about empowering people

00:04:42.400 --> 00:04:44.520 
so for me it's about empowering people
to<00:04:42.880> be<00:04:42.970> able<00:04:43.030> to<00:04:43.120> make<00:04:43.330> things<00:04:43.570> and<00:04:43.930> really

00:04:44.520 --> 00:04:44.530 
to be able to make things and really

00:04:44.530 --> 00:04:46.410 
to be able to make things and really
getting<00:04:44.800> back<00:04:45.160> to<00:04:45.370> the<00:04:45.490> basics<00:04:45.940> in<00:04:46.060> terms<00:04:46.270> of

00:04:46.410 --> 00:04:46.420 
getting back to the basics in terms of

00:04:46.420 --> 00:04:48.390 
getting back to the basics in terms of
manufacturing<00:04:46.800> anybody<00:04:47.800> with<00:04:47.980> a<00:04:48.010> MakerBot

00:04:48.390 --> 00:04:48.400 
manufacturing anybody with a MakerBot

00:04:48.400 --> 00:04:50.160 
manufacturing anybody with a MakerBot
can<00:04:48.790> get<00:04:49.030> a<00:04:49.060> jump<00:04:49.300> start<00:04:49.630> on<00:04:49.780> the<00:04:49.930> next

00:04:50.160 --> 00:04:50.170 
can get a jump start on the next

00:04:50.170 --> 00:04:53.370 
can get a jump start on the next
Industrial<00:04:50.410> Revolution<00:04:51.900> countries<00:04:52.900> all<00:04:53.110> over

00:04:53.370 --> 00:04:53.380 
Industrial Revolution countries all over

00:04:53.380 --> 00:04:55.530 
Industrial Revolution countries all over
the<00:04:53.650> world<00:04:53.860> are<00:04:54.070> making<00:04:54.250> huge<00:04:54.820> investments<00:04:54.970> in

00:04:55.530 --> 00:04:55.540 
the world are making huge investments in

00:04:55.540 --> 00:04:57.930 
the world are making huge investments in
3d<00:04:55.870> printing<00:04:55.900> and<00:04:56.440> this<00:04:57.040> is<00:04:57.340> what<00:04:57.580> the<00:04:57.730> future

00:04:57.930 --> 00:04:57.940 
3d printing and this is what the future

00:04:57.940 --> 00:05:02.130 
3d printing and this is what the future
of<00:04:58.180> global<00:04:58.720> manufacturing<00:04:59.380> could<00:04:59.770> look<00:05:00.070> like
