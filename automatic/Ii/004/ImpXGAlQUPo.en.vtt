00:00:07.050 --> 00:00:11.339
 the probe is sea 1 launched in 2003 to space 

00:00:11.339 --> 00:00:14.449
 with a revolutionary method of ion propulsion 

00:00:14.449 --> 00:00:17.009
 has been done for almost three years 

00:00:17.009 --> 00:00:20.009
 a series of hospital overflights around the moon 

00:00:20.630 --> 00:00:24.289
 managing to capture impressive video images of some regions 

00:00:24.289 --> 00:00:27.569
 Dollars 

00:00:27.569 --> 00:00:31.529
 the video was compiled with a sequence of images taken by the so-called 

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:36.120
 advanced sonar imaging experiment aboard the probe is Mar 1 

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:40.490
 of the European space agency during a full lunar orbit 

00:00:40.490 --> 00:00:43.720
 the spacecraft was flying over the west side of the moon 

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:45.280
 the images 

00:00:45.280 --> 00:00:48.370
 were obtained on December 29, 2004 

00:00:48.370 --> 00:00:52.800
 flying over the west edge of the moon around the length 70 degrees west 

00:00:53.500 --> 00:00:57.900
 Mar 1 was in an orbit that stretched between a thousand kilometers and five 

00:00:57.900 --> 00:01:00.090
 a thousand kilometers away from the moon 

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:03.790
 from this position a series of images could be obtained with a 

00:01:03.790 --> 00:01:08.070
 some separation between them that allowed to build a mosaic from 

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:11.070
 a good part of the apothecary 

00:01:30.230 --> 00:01:31.910
 it is possible to observe 

00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:34.200
 that the images are inverted 

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:37.170
 the direction of the fermi spacecraft that is changing slightly to what 

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:38.810
 long orbit 

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:42.409
 the beginning of the video shows approaches of ancient arias in the 

00:01:42.409 --> 00:01:44.180
 edge of the eastern basin 

00:01:44.180 --> 00:01:47.790
 it is also possible to see why oceans processed ump an area with a 

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:52.190
 auction in five provinces and some highlands to the north with some 

00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:55.190
 visible craters
