00:01:57.709 --> 00:01:57.719 
petals we're just using our ball tool

00:01:57.719 --> 00:01:59.840 
petals we're just using our ball tool
starting<00:01:58.560> at<00:01:58.710> the<00:01:58.829> tip<00:01:59.130> and<00:01:59.369> pulling<00:01:59.700> it

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:06.810 
you put stress on the petal sure looks

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:08.930 
you put stress on the petal sure looks
like<00:02:06.899> gum<00:02:07.259> paste<00:02:07.439> is<00:02:07.710> easy<00:02:07.950> to<00:02:08.250> work<00:02:08.399> with<00:02:08.459> it

00:02:08.930 --> 00:02:08.940 
like gum paste is easy to work with it

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:10.820 
like gum paste is easy to work with it
is<00:02:09.239> it's<00:02:09.569> more<00:02:09.780> you<00:02:09.929> know<00:02:09.959> people<00:02:10.410> look<00:02:10.649> at<00:02:10.739> the

00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:13.400 
but

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:16.089 
but
once<00:02:13.640> they<00:02:13.849> learn<00:02:14.090> how<00:02:14.329> simple<00:02:14.810> it<00:02:14.930> is<00:02:15.099> they're

00:02:16.089 --> 00:02:16.099 
once they learn how simple it is they're

00:02:16.099 --> 00:02:18.130 
once they learn how simple it is they're
just<00:02:16.129> amazed<00:02:16.730> at<00:02:16.939> what<00:02:17.120> they<00:02:17.269> can<00:02:17.329> do<00:02:17.659> and<00:02:17.930> I

veining we're using our veiner tool and
we're<00:02:22.730> putting<00:02:22.939> a<00:02:23.120> center<00:02:23.420> vein<00:02:23.629> down<00:02:23.930> each<00:02:24.170> of

00:02:24.339 --> 00:02:24.349 
we're putting a center vein down each of

00:02:24.349 --> 00:02:26.170 
we're putting a center vein down each of
these<00:02:24.439> petals<00:02:24.829> just<00:02:24.980> like<00:02:25.519> on<00:02:25.670> an<00:02:25.790> actual

00:02:26.170 --> 00:02:26.180
