00:01:47.860 --> 00:01:50.670 
just bringing in Larnell well done I
think<00:01:48.159> the<00:01:49.030> very<00:01:49.240> most<00:01:49.689> important<00:01:50.290> thing<00:01:50.500> is

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:50.680 
think the very most important thing is

00:01:50.680 --> 00:01:53.160 
think the very most important thing is
that<00:01:50.710> you<00:01:51.009> always<00:01:51.280> keep<00:01:51.700> trying<00:01:52.149> and<00:01:52.390> you<00:01:52.869> just

00:01:53.160 --> 00:01:53.170 
that you always keep trying and you just

00:01:53.170 --> 00:01:55.319 
that you always keep trying and you just
saw<00:01:53.350> the<00:01:53.409> example<00:01:53.770> you<00:01:54.399> tried<00:01:54.700> to<00:01:54.820> do<00:01:54.939> a<00:01:54.970> skill

00:01:55.319 --> 00:01:55.329 
saw the example you tried to do a skill

00:01:55.329 --> 00:01:57.840 
saw the example you tried to do a skill
it<00:01:55.630> didn't<00:01:55.930> work<00:01:56.110> out<00:01:56.320> but<00:01:57.220> okay<00:01:57.579> that's

00:01:57.840 --> 00:01:57.850 
it didn't work out but okay that's

00:01:57.850 --> 00:02:00.510 
it didn't work out but okay that's
that's<00:01:58.270> part<00:01:58.450> of<00:01:58.600> the<00:01:58.720> game<00:01:58.899> next<00:01:59.770> time<00:02:00.070> you

00:02:00.510 --> 00:02:00.520 
that's part of the game next time you

00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:02.969 
that's part of the game next time you
get<00:02:00.640> the<00:02:00.820> ball<00:02:01.000> you<00:02:01.299> get<00:02:01.689> new<00:02:01.930> chances<00:02:02.500> doesn't
