00:01:18.670 --> 00:01:18.680 

00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:23.929 

we'll<00:01:19.680> slide<00:01:19.920> under<00:01:20.189> the<00:01:20.220> seat<00:01:22.729> now<00:01:23.729> this

cable you can secure the box like this

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:33.319 
cable you can secure the box like this
on<00:01:31.049> one<00:01:31.200> of<00:01:31.229> the<00:01:31.320> posts<00:01:31.650> of<00:01:31.710> the<00:01:31.799> seat<00:01:32.240> and<00:01:33.240> then

00:01:33.319 --> 00:01:33.329 
on one of the posts of the seat and then

00:01:33.329 --> 00:01:34.880 
on one of the posts of the seat and then
put<00:01:33.540> it<00:01:33.630> through<00:01:33.750> this<00:01:33.930> notch<00:01:34.140> here<00:01:34.170> and<00:01:34.710> close

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:34.890 
put it through this notch here and close

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:39.289 
put it through this notch here and close
it<00:01:35.130> and<00:01:35.850> it's<00:01:36.270> secure<00:01:37.100> now<00:01:38.100> this<00:01:38.310> box<00:01:38.579> is<00:01:38.850> 18

00:01:39.289 --> 00:01:39.299 
it and it's secure now this box is 18

00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:41.090 
it and it's secure now this box is 18
gauge<00:01:39.509> steel<00:01:39.869> and<00:01:40.259> a<00:01:40.560> lot<00:01:40.710> of<00:01:40.740> them<00:01:40.920> are<00:01:40.979> only

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:41.100 
gauge steel and a lot of them are only

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:44.230 
gauge steel and a lot of them are only
20<00:01:41.490> gauge<00:01:41.729> so<00:01:42.299> this<00:01:42.420> little<00:01:42.570> bit<00:01:42.659> stronger<00:01:43.140> now

00:01:44.230 --> 00:01:44.240 
20 gauge so this little bit stronger now

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:46.780 
20 gauge so this little bit stronger now
I<00:01:45.240> kind<00:01:45.570> of<00:01:45.659> thought<00:01:45.810> if<00:01:45.990> you<00:01:46.110> would<00:01:46.290> wrap<00:01:46.500> it

00:01:46.780 --> 00:01:46.790 
I kind of thought if you would wrap it

00:01:46.790 --> 00:01:50.749 
I kind of thought if you would wrap it
around<00:01:47.790> the<00:01:48.180> back<00:01:48.390> here<00:01:49.430> it<00:01:50.430> would<00:01:50.549> actually

00:01:50.749 --> 00:01:50.759 
around the back here it would actually

00:01:50.759 --> 00:01:53.300 
around the back here it would actually

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:53.310 
keep the keep the cable of them we're

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:55.310 
keep the keep the cable of them we're
out<00:01:53.430> of<00:01:53.460> the<00:01:53.579> way<00:01:53.729> of<00:01:53.939> the<00:01:54.210> firearm<00:01:54.659> a<00:01:54.869> lot<00:01:55.229> of

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:55.320 
out of the way of the firearm a lot of

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:57.380 
out of the way of the firearm a lot of
to<00:01:55.409> experiment<00:01:55.860> with<00:01:55.950> that<00:01:56.149> now<00:01:57.149> I<00:01:57.180> wouldn't

00:01:57.380 --> 00:01:57.390 
to experiment with that now I wouldn't

00:01:57.390 --> 00:01:58.880 
to experiment with that now I wouldn't
necessarily<00:01:57.509> recommend<00:01:57.930> the<00:01:58.320> driver's<00:01:58.710> side

00:01:58.880 --> 00:01:58.890 
necessarily recommend the driver's side

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:01.249 
necessarily recommend the driver's side
because<00:01:59.310> you<00:01:59.399> don't<00:01:59.610> want<00:01:59.820> on<00:02:00.299> a<00:02:00.360> hook<00:02:00.990> stop

00:02:01.249 --> 00:02:01.259 
because you don't want on a hook stop

00:02:01.259 --> 00:02:03.830 
because you don't want on a hook stop
the<00:02:01.829> boxes<00:02:02.250> slide<00:02:02.460> out<00:02:02.670> and<00:02:02.880> get<00:02:03.570> in<00:02:03.659> the<00:02:03.719> way

00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:03.840 
the boxes slide out and get in the way

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:05.690 
the boxes slide out and get in the way
of<00:02:03.869> your<00:02:04.020> feet<00:02:04.259> so<00:02:04.469> I<00:02:04.890> probably<00:02:05.159> recommend<00:02:05.520> the

00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:05.700 
of your feet so I probably recommend the

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:07.819 
of your feet so I probably recommend the
passenger<00:02:06.149> side<00:02:06.360> now<00:02:06.750> this<00:02:07.439> is<00:02:07.560> a<00:02:07.590> lot<00:02:07.799> more

00:02:07.819 --> 00:02:07.829 
passenger side now this is a lot more

00:02:07.829 --> 00:02:10.490 
passenger side now this is a lot more
important<00:02:08.489> in<00:02:08.670> vehicles<00:02:09.360> today<00:02:09.660> because<00:02:10.349> in

00:02:10.490 --> 00:02:10.500 
important in vehicles today because in

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:13.250 
important in vehicles today because in

00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:33.690 
what I was indicating before trying to

00:03:33.690 --> 00:03:36.410 
what I was indicating before trying to
even<00:03:33.810> better<00:03:34.139> look<00:03:34.350> at<00:03:34.590> it<00:03:35.030> where<00:03:36.030> I<00:03:36.060> was<00:03:36.269> just

00:03:36.410 --> 00:03:36.420 
even better look at it where I was just

00:03:36.420 --> 00:03:39.170 
even better look at it where I was just
wrapping<00:03:36.600> the<00:03:37.579> cable<00:03:38.579> around<00:03:38.670> the<00:03:38.940> backside

00:03:39.170 --> 00:03:39.180 
wrapping the cable around the backside

00:03:39.180 --> 00:03:40.610 
wrapping the cable around the backside
here<00:03:39.630> to<00:03:39.750> keep<00:03:39.870> this<00:03:40.049> all<00:03:40.230> the<00:03:40.350> way<00:03:40.440> your

00:03:40.610 --> 00:03:40.620 
here to keep this all the way your

00:03:40.620 --> 00:03:43.610 
here to keep this all the way your
firearm<00:03:41.040> otherwise<00:03:42.019> if<00:03:43.019> you<00:03:43.109> just<00:03:43.230> put<00:03:43.410> it<00:03:43.500> in

00:03:43.610 --> 00:03:43.620 
firearm otherwise if you just put it in

00:03:43.620 --> 00:03:45.949 
firearm otherwise if you just put it in
here<00:03:43.859> like<00:03:43.920> this<00:03:44.489> that's<00:03:44.910> okay<00:03:45.269> but<00:03:45.630> you<00:03:45.660> know

00:03:45.949 --> 00:03:45.959 
here like this that's okay but you know

00:03:45.959 --> 00:03:47.599 
here like this that's okay but you know
this<00:03:46.380> does<00:03:46.590> not<00:03:46.709> keep<00:03:46.920> from<00:03:46.980> sliding<00:03:47.370> around

00:03:47.599 --> 00:03:47.609 
this does not keep from sliding around

00:03:47.609 --> 00:03:49.520 
this does not keep from sliding around
and<00:03:48.030> I<00:03:48.239> just<00:03:48.810> kind<00:03:48.959> of<00:03:48.989> like<00:03:49.109> to<00:03:49.200> keep<00:03:49.230> things

00:03:49.520 --> 00:03:49.530 
and I just kind of like to keep things

00:03:49.530 --> 00:03:53.240 
and I just kind of like to keep things
out<00:03:49.709> away<00:03:50.299> also<00:03:51.299> this<00:03:51.480> is<00:03:51.720> a<00:03:51.930> a<00:03:52.260> steel<00:03:52.769> this<00:03:53.100> is

00:03:53.240 --> 00:03:53.250 
out away also this is a a steel this is

00:03:53.250 --> 00:03:55.729 
out away also this is a a steel this is
all<00:03:53.400> steel<00:03:53.670> here<00:03:54.030> with<00:03:54.329> the<00:03:54.569> where<00:03:55.440> the<00:03:55.530> latch

00:03:55.729 --> 00:03:55.739 
all steel here with the where the latch

00:03:55.739 --> 00:03:58.309 
all steel here with the where the latch
is<00:03:56.549> that<00:03:56.940> and<00:03:57.389> on<00:03:57.599> the<00:03:57.690> other<00:03:57.780> side<00:03:58.049> of<00:03:58.079> course

00:03:58.309 --> 00:03:58.319 
is that and on the other side of course

00:03:58.319 --> 00:04:00.830 
is that and on the other side of course
that<00:03:58.560> is<00:03:58.739> in<00:03:59.250> metal<00:03:59.400> they<00:04:00.269> only<00:04:00.480> probably

00:04:00.830 --> 00:04:00.840 
that is in metal they only probably

00:04:00.840 --> 00:04:02.960 
that is in metal they only probably
improve<00:04:01.170> it<00:04:01.319> I<00:04:01.380> would<00:04:01.530> make<00:04:01.739> to<00:04:02.250> the<00:04:02.400> boxes<00:04:02.819> it

00:04:02.960 --> 00:04:02.970 
improve it I would make to the boxes it

00:04:02.970 --> 00:04:05.000 
improve it I would make to the boxes it
is<00:04:03.000> I'm<00:04:03.359> probably<00:04:03.480> going<00:04:03.720> to<00:04:03.810> take<00:04:03.959> some<00:04:04.739> foam

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:05.010 
is I'm probably going to take some foam

00:04:05.010 --> 00:04:06.979 
is I'm probably going to take some foam
and<00:04:05.730> you<00:04:05.790> can<00:04:05.910> see<00:04:06.090> that<00:04:06.269> these<00:04:06.420> two<00:04:06.630> sided

00:04:06.979 --> 00:04:06.989 
and you can see that these two sided

00:04:06.989 --> 00:04:09.640 
and you can see that these two sided
sticky<00:04:07.260> tape<00:04:07.410> isn't<00:04:07.889> holding<00:04:08.370> the<00:04:08.459> phone<00:04:08.639> here

00:04:09.640 --> 00:04:09.650 
sticky tape isn't holding the phone here

00:04:09.650 --> 00:04:12.830 
sticky tape isn't holding the phone here
either<00:04:10.650> takes<00:04:10.889> some<00:04:11.120> letter<00:04:12.120> T<00:04:12.329> sided<00:04:12.660> sticky

00:04:12.830 --> 00:04:12.840 
either takes some letter T sided sticky

00:04:12.840 --> 00:04:15.339 
either takes some letter T sided sticky
tape<00:04:12.989> or<00:04:13.410> maybe<00:04:13.650> some<00:04:13.950> silicone<00:04:14.459> caulk<00:04:14.700> and

00:04:15.339 --> 00:04:15.349 
tape or maybe some silicone caulk and

00:04:15.349 --> 00:04:17.629 
tape or maybe some silicone caulk and
kind<00:04:16.349> of<00:04:16.380> make<00:04:16.620> sure<00:04:16.739> those<00:04:16.919> are<00:04:16.950> security<00:04:17.250> in

00:04:17.629 --> 00:04:17.639 
kind of make sure those are security in

00:04:17.639 --> 00:04:19.699 
kind of make sure those are security in
but<00:04:17.849> also<00:04:18.049> thinking<00:04:19.049> of<00:04:19.109> having<00:04:19.289> a<00:04:19.470> well

00:04:19.699 --> 00:04:19.709 
but also thinking of having a well

00:04:19.709 --> 00:04:24.339 
but also thinking of having a well
around<00:04:20.010> the<00:04:20.570> outside<00:04:21.570> I<00:04:22.820> mean<00:04:23.820> here<00:04:23.970> you<00:04:24.000> have

00:04:24.339 --> 00:04:24.349 
around the outside I mean here you have

00:04:24.349 --> 00:04:26.890 
around the outside I mean here you have
Springfield<00:04:25.349> army<00:04:25.620> XDS

00:04:26.890 --> 00:04:26.900 
Springfield army XDS

00:04:26.900 --> 00:04:28.780 
Springfield army XDS
and<00:04:26.990> you<00:04:27.470> know<00:04:27.530> you<00:04:27.650> start<00:04:27.710> to<00:04:27.949> say<00:04:28.160> you<00:04:28.220> could

00:04:28.780 --> 00:04:28.790 
and you know you start to say you could

00:04:28.790 --> 00:04:30.219 
and you know you start to say you could
see<00:04:28.940> could<00:04:29.090> slide<00:04:29.330> around<00:04:29.449> in<00:04:29.720> there<00:04:29.870> it's<00:04:30.110> not

00:04:30.219 --> 00:04:30.229 
see could slide around in there it's not

00:04:30.229 --> 00:04:31.990 
see could slide around in there it's not
going<00:04:30.380> to<00:04:30.470> be<00:04:30.680> held<00:04:30.860> snowed<00:04:31.190> by<00:04:31.400> this<00:04:31.460> foam<00:04:31.820> or

00:04:31.990 --> 00:04:32.000 
going to be held snowed by this foam or

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:35.050 
going to be held snowed by this foam or
anything<00:04:32.199> so<00:04:33.199> again<00:04:33.830> I<00:04:33.860> don't<00:04:34.160> rather<00:04:34.880> than

00:04:35.050 --> 00:04:35.060 
anything so again I don't rather than

00:04:35.060 --> 00:04:37.870 
anything so again I don't rather than
have<00:04:35.210> this<00:04:35.500> interfere<00:04:36.500> I'm<00:04:37.460> going<00:04:37.639> to<00:04:37.699> wrap<00:04:37.850> it

00:04:37.870 --> 00:04:37.880 
have this interfere I'm going to wrap it

00:04:37.880 --> 00:04:40.659 
have this interfere I'm going to wrap it
around<00:04:38.090> I<00:04:38.389> think<00:04:38.710> see<00:04:39.710> how<00:04:39.770> that<00:04:39.949> works<00:04:40.130> out

00:04:40.659 --> 00:04:40.669 
around I think see how that works out

00:04:40.669 --> 00:04:43.029 
around I think see how that works out
tuck<00:04:41.479> it<00:04:41.600> back<00:04:41.720> in<00:04:41.960> there<00:04:42.169> I'm<00:04:42.530> also<00:04:42.710> I<00:04:42.860> ain't

going to try to glue in some some foam

00:04:45.050 --> 00:04:47.350 
going to try to glue in some some foam
around<00:04:45.380> here<00:04:45.590> because<00:04:45.770> I'd<00:04:45.860> like<00:04:46.340> to<00:04:46.550> watch<00:04:47.180> it

00:04:47.350 --> 00:04:47.360 
around here because I'd like to watch it

00:04:47.360 --> 00:04:50.200 
around here because I'd like to watch it
possible<00:04:47.780> not<00:04:48.169> have<00:04:48.350> my<00:04:48.470> firearms<00:04:48.979> get<00:04:49.210> get

obviously<00:04:53.330> is<00:04:53.419> kind<00:04:53.600> of<00:04:53.860> finishes<00:04:54.860> are<00:04:54.949> going

00:04:55.060 --> 00:04:55.070 
obviously is kind of finishes are going

obviously is kind of finishes are going
to<00:04:55.130> be<00:04:55.190> perfect<00:04:55.610> and<00:04:55.880> I've<00:04:55.970> tried<00:04:56.120> some<00:04:56.300> other

00:04:56.379 --> 00:04:56.389 
to be perfect and I've tried some other

00:04:56.389 --> 00:04:58.510 
to be perfect and I've tried some other
farms<00:04:57.259> this<00:04:57.320> is<00:04:57.500> actually<00:04:57.860> the<00:04:57.949> excel<00:04:58.280> box

00:04:58.510 --> 00:04:58.520 
farms this is actually the excel box

00:04:58.520 --> 00:05:00.760 
farms this is actually the excel box
they<00:04:58.820> say<00:04:59.030> it's<00:04:59.210> larger<00:04:59.660> is<00:04:59.780> ten<00:05:00.050> by<00:05:00.260> seven<00:05:00.650> by

00:05:00.760 --> 00:05:00.770 
they say it's larger is ten by seven by

they say it's larger is ten by seven by
two

00:05:01.360 --> 00:05:01.370 
two

00:05:01.370 --> 00:05:02.800 
two
I<00:05:01.400> could<00:05:01.789> go<00:05:01.910> with<00:05:02.000> smaller<00:05:02.360> one<00:05:02.510> obviously

00:05:02.800 --> 00:05:02.810 
I could go with smaller one obviously

00:05:02.810 --> 00:05:05.710 
I could go with smaller one obviously
for<00:05:03.050> the<00:05:03.139> XDS<00:05:03.590> you've<00:05:04.039> got<00:05:04.160> a<00:05:04.190> smaller<00:05:05.030> nine
