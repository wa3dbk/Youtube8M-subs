Vanquish<00:00:47.790> features<00:00:48.120> a<00:00:48.150> variable<00:00:48.750> dead<00:00:48.930> rise

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:49.110 
Vanquish features a variable dead rise

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:51.050 
Vanquish features a variable dead rise
bottom<00:00:49.530> 50<00:00:50.130> degree<00:00:50.370> dead<00:00:50.579> rise<00:00:50.730> all<00:00:50.940> the<00:00:50.970> way

00:00:51.050 --> 00:00:51.060 
bottom 50 degree dead rise all the way

00:00:51.060 --> 00:00:52.970 
bottom 50 degree dead rise all the way
up<00:00:51.239> in<00:00:51.360> the<00:00:51.450> very<00:00:51.630> very<00:00:51.780> tip<00:00:51.960> of<00:00:52.020> the<00:00:52.140> bow<00:00:52.320> and

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:52.980 
up in the very very tip of the bow and

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:54.950 
up in the very very tip of the bow and
then<00:00:53.340> it's<00:00:53.520> a<00:00:53.610> 24<00:00:54.120> degree<00:00:54.360> which<00:00:54.570> is<00:00:54.600> what

00:00:54.950 --> 00:00:54.960 
then it's a 24 degree which is what

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:56.569 
then it's a 24 degree which is what
people<00:00:55.200> are<00:00:55.290> more<00:00:55.470> accustomed<00:00:55.890> to<00:00:55.950> right<00:00:56.460> if

00:00:56.569 --> 00:00:56.579 
people are more accustomed to right if

00:00:56.579 --> 00:00:58.069 
people are more accustomed to right if
the<00:00:56.700> cut<00:00:56.880> water<00:00:57.090> or<00:00:57.329> where<00:00:57.480> the<00:00:57.630> hull<00:00:57.780> axis

00:00:58.069 --> 00:00:58.079 
the cut water or where the hull axis

00:00:58.079 --> 00:00:59.840 
the cut water or where the hull axis
Lysa's<00:00:58.380> through<00:00:58.530> the<00:00:58.620> waves<00:00:58.800> we<00:00:59.160> transition

00:00:59.840 --> 00:00:59.850 
Lysa's through the waves we transition

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:03.139 
Lysa's through the waves we transition
to<00:00:59.880> a<00:00:59.970> flatter<00:01:00.300> dead<00:01:01.170> rise<00:01:01.350> aft<00:01:01.880> for<00:01:02.880> a<00:01:02.910> couple

00:01:03.139 --> 00:01:03.149 
to a flatter dead rise aft for a couple

00:01:03.149 --> 00:01:04.429 
to a flatter dead rise aft for a couple
of<00:01:03.210> reasons<00:01:03.360> one<00:01:03.690> it<00:01:03.840> makes<00:01:03.989> it<00:01:04.110> much<00:01:04.199> more

00:01:04.429 --> 00:01:04.439 
of reasons one it makes it much more

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:05.719 
of reasons one it makes it much more
efficient<00:01:04.890> hull<00:01:05.009> cuz<00:01:05.220> you're<00:01:05.369> carving<00:01:05.640> a

00:01:05.719 --> 00:01:05.729 
efficient hull cuz you're carving a

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:08.059 
efficient hull cuz you're carving a
smaller<00:01:05.970> hole<00:01:06.180> in<00:01:06.329> the<00:01:06.390> water<00:01:06.619> and<00:01:07.619> to<00:01:07.889> the

00:01:08.059 --> 00:01:08.069 
smaller hole in the water and to the

00:01:08.069 --> 00:01:10.129 
smaller hole in the water and to the
boat<00:01:08.219> is<00:01:08.340> much<00:01:08.520> more<00:01:08.700> stable<00:01:09.119> at<00:01:09.210> rest<00:01:09.420> which

00:01:10.129 --> 00:01:10.139 
boat is much more stable at rest which

00:01:10.139 --> 00:01:11.179 
boat is much more stable at rest which
at<00:01:10.229> the<00:01:10.289> end<00:01:10.350> of<00:01:10.439> the<00:01:10.499> day<00:01:10.619> is<00:01:10.770> when<00:01:10.920> people<00:01:11.039> are

00:01:11.179 --> 00:01:11.189 
at the end of the day is when people are
