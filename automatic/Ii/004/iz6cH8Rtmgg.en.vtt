you<00:03:02.130> know<00:03:02.250> he<00:03:02.340> probably<00:03:02.459> wouldn't<00:03:02.940> do<00:03:03.060> that

00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:03.090 
you know he probably wouldn't do that

00:03:03.090 --> 00:03:04.940 
you know he probably wouldn't do that
because<00:03:03.360> he'll<00:03:03.540> probably<00:03:03.690> go<00:03:04.440> for<00:03:04.650> less<00:03:04.800> than

00:03:04.940 --> 00:03:04.950 
because he'll probably go for less than

00:03:04.950 --> 00:03:07.100 
because he'll probably go for less than
the<00:03:05.010> price<00:03:05.220> I<00:03:05.550> she<00:03:05.790> bought<00:03:05.970> him<00:03:06.120> for<00:03:06.330> but<00:03:06.600> as

00:03:07.100 --> 00:03:07.110 
the price I she bought him for but as

00:03:07.110 --> 00:03:09.830 
the price I she bought him for but as
for<00:03:07.709> their<00:03:07.860> we<00:03:08.010> actually<00:03:08.340> obviously<00:03:09.239> sold<00:03:09.600> a

00:03:09.830 --> 00:03:09.840 
for their we actually obviously sold a

00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:11.330 
for their we actually obviously sold a
couple<00:03:10.019> of<00:03:10.170> other<00:03:10.320> players<00:03:10.590> I<00:03:10.739> think<00:03:10.920> I<00:03:11.130> sold

00:03:11.330 --> 00:03:11.340 
couple of other players I think I sold

00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:13.070 
couple of other players I think I sold
my<00:03:11.459> hope<00:03:11.670> was<00:03:11.850> ill<00:03:12.030> word<00:03:12.330> which<00:03:12.510> Awards<00:03:12.900> worth

00:03:13.070 --> 00:03:13.080 
my hope was ill word which Awards worth

00:03:13.080 --> 00:03:15.620 
my hope was ill word which Awards worth
around<00:03:13.290> 15<00:03:14.220> care<00:03:14.459> so<00:03:14.760> not<00:03:15.000> even<00:03:15.209> that<00:03:15.420> to<00:03:15.540> be

00:03:15.620 --> 00:03:15.630 
around 15 care so not even that to be

00:03:15.630 --> 00:03:17.180 
around 15 care so not even that to be
honest<00:03:15.840> but<00:03:16.380> still<00:03:16.650> there<00:03:16.830> we<00:03:16.950> actually

00:03:17.180 --> 00:03:17.190 
honest but still there we actually

00:03:17.190 --> 00:03:19.640 
honest but still there we actually
picked<00:03:17.280> up<00:03:17.459> another<00:03:17.790> informs<00:03:18.360> our<00:03:18.480> buena<00:03:18.750> for

00:03:19.640 --> 00:03:19.650 
picked up another informs our buena for

00:03:19.650 --> 00:03:21.620 
picked up another informs our buena for
I<00:03:19.980> believe<00:03:20.130> that<00:03:20.310> was<00:03:20.700> thirty<00:03:21.000> six<00:03:21.269> thousand

00:03:21.620 --> 00:03:21.630 
I believe that was thirty six thousand

00:03:21.630 --> 00:03:23.840 
I believe that was thirty six thousand
two<00:03:21.780> hundred<00:03:21.810> fifty<00:03:22.140> coins<00:03:22.560> in<00:03:22.799> a<00:03:23.250> full<00:03:23.430> 12<00:03:23.579> and

00:03:23.840 --> 00:03:23.850 
two hundred fifty coins in a full 12 and

00:03:23.850 --> 00:03:25.670 
two hundred fifty coins in a full 12 and
two<00:03:24.000> so<00:03:24.269> that<00:03:24.360> meant<00:03:24.600> we<00:03:24.810> can<00:03:24.989> set<00:03:25.260> we<00:03:25.530> can

00:03:25.670 --> 00:03:25.680 
two so that meant we can set we can

00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:27.740 
two so that meant we can set we can
convert<00:03:26.430> them<00:03:26.549> to<00:03:26.579> a<00:03:26.700> right<00:03:27.000> midfield<00:03:27.480> which

00:03:27.740 --> 00:03:27.750 
convert them to a right midfield which

00:03:27.750 --> 00:03:31.819 
convert them to a right midfield which
is<00:03:27.959> exactly<00:03:28.920> what<00:03:29.430> I<00:03:29.489> did<00:03:29.959> you<00:03:30.959> know<00:03:30.989> 1000

00:03:31.819 --> 00:03:31.829 
is exactly what I did you know 1000

00:03:31.829 --> 00:03:33.140 
is exactly what I did you know 1000
coins<00:03:31.950> you<00:03:32.160> can't<00:03:32.340> really<00:03:32.519> go<00:03:32.610> wrong<00:03:32.640> for<00:03:33.060> that

00:03:33.140 --> 00:03:33.150 
coins you can't really go wrong for that

00:03:33.150 --> 00:03:36.560 
coins you can't really go wrong for that
price<00:03:33.390> and<00:03:33.660> I<00:03:34.560> think<00:03:34.950> to<00:03:35.269> be<00:03:36.269> honest<00:03:36.420> the

00:03:36.560 --> 00:03:36.570 
price and I think to be honest the

00:03:36.570 --> 00:03:38.569 
price and I think to be honest the
conversion<00:03:37.140> between<00:03:37.769> the<00:03:38.220> right<00:03:38.400> wouldn't

00:03:38.569 --> 00:03:38.579 
conversion between the right wouldn't

00:03:38.579 --> 00:03:40.880 
conversion between the right wouldn't
invite<00:03:38.850> made<00:03:39.090> for<00:03:39.570> example<00:03:39.989> if<00:03:40.260> you<00:03:40.590> wanted<00:03:40.680> to

00:03:40.880 --> 00:03:40.890 
invite made for example if you wanted to

00:03:40.890 --> 00:03:44.150 
invite made for example if you wanted to
say<00:03:41.040> buy<00:03:41.250> right<00:03:41.670> Wendy<00:03:42.239> Marya<00:03:42.600> for<00:03:43.170> say<00:03:43.860> it<00:03:44.070> was

00:03:44.150 --> 00:03:44.160 
say buy right Wendy Marya for say it was

00:03:44.160 --> 00:03:46.220 
say buy right Wendy Marya for say it was
going<00:03:44.310> from<00:03:44.549> 9k<00:03:44.970> I<00:03:45.180> think<00:03:45.780> the<00:03:45.870> right<00:03:46.049> mid

00:03:46.220 --> 00:03:46.230 
going from 9k I think the right mid

00:03:46.230 --> 00:03:48.920 
going from 9k I think the right mid
would<00:03:46.380> go<00:03:46.500> for<00:03:46.680> about<00:03:46.860> 12<00:03:47.160> k<00:03:47.400> 13<00:03:47.820> k<00:03:48.060> so<00:03:48.120> people

00:03:48.920 --> 00:03:48.930 
would go for about 12 k 13 k so people

00:03:48.930 --> 00:03:50.539 
would go for about 12 k 13 k so people
don't<00:03:49.079> understand<00:03:49.560> that<00:03:49.709> you<00:03:50.130> know<00:03:50.250> they<00:03:50.400> can

00:03:50.539 --> 00:03:50.549 
don't understand that you know they can

00:03:50.549 --> 00:03:52.610 
don't understand that you know they can
easily<00:03:50.880> buy<00:03:51.060> a<00:03:51.090> right<00:03:51.329> midcard<00:03:51.750> of<00:03:52.230> white<00:03:52.470> room

00:03:52.610 --> 00:03:52.620 
easily buy a right midcard of white room

00:03:52.620 --> 00:03:54.380 
easily buy a right midcard of white room
to<00:03:52.769> write<00:03:52.890> me<00:03:53.070> a<00:03:53.100> card<00:03:53.310> and<00:03:53.519> save<00:03:53.730> themselves<00:03:54.180> a

to write me a card and save themselves a

00:03:54.390 --> 00:03:56.360 
to write me a card and save themselves a
lot<00:03:54.810> of<00:03:54.930> coins<00:03:55.140> but<00:03:55.350> you<00:03:55.470> know<00:03:55.560> that's<00:03:56.130> how<00:03:56.250> it

00:03:56.360 --> 00:03:56.370 
lot of coins but you know that's how it

00:03:56.370 --> 00:03:58.430 
lot of coins but you know that's how it
goes<00:03:56.600> that's<00:03:57.600> where<00:03:57.810> the<00:03:57.870> profits<00:03:58.200> to<00:03:58.320> be<00:03:58.410> made

goes that's where the profits to be made

00:03:58.440 --> 00:04:01.370 
goes that's where the profits to be made
and<00:03:58.829> people<00:03:59.459> forget<00:03:59.910> that<00:04:00.060> so<00:04:00.420> you<00:04:01.140> know<00:04:01.260> it's

00:04:01.370 --> 00:04:01.380 
and people forget that so you know it's

00:04:01.380 --> 00:04:03.530

00:04:03.530 --> 00:04:03.540 
what you've gotta do to make this coins

00:04:03.540 --> 00:04:05.750

00:04:05.750 --> 00:04:05.760 
and everything so I so here we are

00:04:05.760 --> 00:04:07.970 
and everything so I so here we are
actually<00:04:06.390> just<00:04:06.720> applying<00:04:07.170> the<00:04:07.530> item<00:04:07.950> to
