liking this setup it's really powerful
gameplay<00:01:06.750> I<00:01:06.780> start<00:01:07.200> off<00:01:07.320> pretty<00:01:07.979> slow<00:01:08.400> not

00:01:09.109 --> 00:01:09.119 
gameplay I start off pretty slow not

00:01:09.119 --> 00:01:12.500 
gameplay I start off pretty slow not
used<00:01:09.420> to<00:01:09.570> using<00:01:09.780> SMGs<00:01:10.560> I'm<00:01:10.770> used<00:01:10.950> to<00:01:11.070> the<00:01:11.880> ACR

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:12.510 
used to using SMGs I'm used to the ACR

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:16.219 
used to using SMGs I'm used to the ACR
those<00:01:13.229> types<00:01:13.500> of<00:01:13.680> guns<00:01:13.860> scar<00:01:14.340> and<00:01:14.659> 14<00:01:15.659> so<00:01:15.990> a

00:01:16.219 --> 00:01:16.229 
those types of guns scar and 14 so a

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:18.710 
those types of guns scar and 14 so a
little<00:01:16.860> bit<00:01:17.040> out<00:01:17.159> of<00:01:17.189> my<00:01:17.340> element<00:01:17.430> with<00:01:17.970> smgs

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:18.720 
little bit out of my element with smgs

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:20.810 
little bit out of my element with smgs
you<00:01:18.869> kind<00:01:19.049> of<00:01:19.080> move<00:01:19.229> around<00:01:19.409> a<00:01:19.860> lot<00:01:20.640> quicker

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:20.820 
you kind of move around a lot quicker

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:22.370 
you kind of move around a lot quicker
than<00:01:21.090> that<00:01:21.240> so<00:01:21.390> it's<00:01:21.540> hard<00:01:21.689> to<00:01:21.750> establish<00:01:21.990> a

00:01:22.370 --> 00:01:22.380 
than that so it's hard to establish a

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:24.350 
than that so it's hard to establish a
target<00:01:22.740> but<00:01:22.920> seem<00:01:23.670> to<00:01:23.759> do<00:01:23.880> pretty<00:01:23.909> well<00:01:24.299> in

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:24.360 
target but seem to do pretty well in

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:26.840 
target but seem to do pretty well in
this<00:01:24.600> gameplay<00:01:25.009> but<00:01:26.009> I<00:01:26.340> don't<00:01:26.670> have<00:01:26.790> the

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:26.850 
this gameplay but I don't have the

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:29.960 
this gameplay but I don't have the
actual<00:01:27.119> stats<00:01:27.720> on<00:01:28.080> what<00:01:28.380> was<00:01:28.530> changed<00:01:28.979> with

00:01:58.010 --> 00:01:58.020 
m16 is just crazy off the hook good the

m16 is just crazy off the hook good the
fat<00:01:58.320> is<00:01:58.350> a<00:01:58.680> four-hit<00:01:59.280> kill<00:01:59.579> even<00:02:00.390> with<00:02:00.509> the

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:00.600 
fat is a four-hit kill even with the

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:02.840 
fat is a four-hit kill even with the
silencer<00:02:01.140> so<00:02:01.439> I'm<00:02:01.799> definitely<00:02:02.189> be<00:02:02.640> trying

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:02.850 
silencer so I'm definitely be trying

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:06.440 
silencer so I'm definitely be trying
that<00:02:03.090> one<00:02:03.270> out<00:02:03.390> i<00:02:03.420> like<00:02:03.899> the<00:02:04.049> fat<00:02:04.290> but<00:02:05.040> I<00:02:05.450> loaded

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:06.450 
that one out i like the fat but I loaded

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:08.990 
that one out i like the fat but I loaded
up<00:02:06.600> the<00:02:06.659> UMP<00:02:07.290> here<00:02:07.649> and<00:02:08.489> I'll<00:02:08.580> tell<00:02:08.759> you<00:02:08.849> what<00:02:08.970> I

00:02:08.990 --> 00:02:09.000 
up the UMP here and I'll tell you what I

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:10.809 
up the UMP here and I'll tell you what I
was<00:02:09.179> not<00:02:09.360> disappointed<00:02:09.539> this<00:02:10.110> gun<00:02:10.319> delivers

00:02:10.809 --> 00:02:10.819 
was not disappointed this gun delivers

00:02:10.819 --> 00:02:13.760 
was not disappointed this gun delivers
it's<00:02:11.819> a<00:02:12.000> the<00:02:12.510> long-range<00:02:13.110> damage

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:13.770 
it's a the long-range damage

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:17.000 
it's a the long-range damage
on<00:02:13.890> this<00:02:14.130> gun<00:02:14.430> was<00:02:15.150> increased<00:02:15.780> so<00:02:16.200> what<00:02:16.980> that

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:17.010 
on this gun was increased so what that

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:19.280 
on this gun was increased so what that
means<00:02:17.370> is<00:02:17.610> basically<00:02:17.790> it<00:02:18.360> kind<00:02:18.660> of<00:02:18.690> rounds<00:02:19.170> out

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:19.290 
means is basically it kind of rounds out

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:22.850 
means is basically it kind of rounds out
the<00:02:19.470> UMP<00:02:19.860> is<00:02:19.890> being<00:02:20.310> a<00:02:20.400> good<00:02:20.580> all<00:02:20.610> around<00:02:21.860> SMG

00:02:22.850 --> 00:02:22.860 
the UMP is being a good all around SMG

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:25.880 
the UMP is being a good all around SMG
now<00:02:23.040> is<00:02:23.790> it<00:02:23.970> better<00:02:24.120> than<00:02:24.240> the<00:02:24.390> mp7<00:02:24.780> I'm<00:02:25.680> not

00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:25.890 
now is it better than the mp7 I'm not

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:28.130 
now is it better than the mp7 I'm not
real<00:02:26.100> sure<00:02:26.130> a<00:02:26.520> lot<00:02:27.210> of<00:02:27.270> reasons<00:02:27.690> people<00:02:27.930> like

00:02:28.130 --> 00:02:28.140 
real sure a lot of reasons people like

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:30.260 
real sure a lot of reasons people like
the<00:02:28.260> mp7<00:02:28.530> is<00:02:28.920> because<00:02:29.220> there's<00:02:29.430> no<00:02:29.610> recoil<00:02:30.000> so

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:30.270 
the mp7 is because there's no recoil so

00:02:30.270 --> 00:02:32.270 
the mp7 is because there's no recoil so
it's<00:02:30.450> super<00:02:30.750> easy<00:02:30.780> to<00:02:31.350> get<00:02:31.920> on<00:02:31.950> your<00:02:32.100> target

00:02:32.270 --> 00:02:32.280 
it's super easy to get on your target

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:33.800 
it's super easy to get on your target
right<00:02:32.580> here<00:02:32.790> I'm<00:02:32.880> kind<00:02:33.090> of<00:02:33.180> checking<00:02:33.450> out<00:02:33.660> the

00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:33.810 
right here I'm kind of checking out the

00:02:33.810 --> 00:02:36.320 
right here I'm kind of checking out the
distance<00:02:34.200> on<00:02:34.410> the<00:02:34.730> UMP<00:02:35.730> and<00:02:35.850> you<00:02:35.940> can<00:02:36.090> see<00:02:36.300> that

00:02:36.320 --> 00:02:36.330 
distance on the UMP and you can see that

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:38.990 
distance on the UMP and you can see that
oh<00:02:36.720> yeah<00:02:36.960> get<00:02:37.950> some<00:02:37.980> long<00:02:38.340> shots<00:02:38.640> on<00:02:38.820> there

00:02:38.990 --> 00:02:39.000 
oh yeah get some long shots on there

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:42.770 
oh yeah get some long shots on there
this<00:02:39.570> does<00:02:39.840> not<00:02:39.980> fail<00:02:40.980> as<00:02:41.250> far<00:02:41.490> as<00:02:41.670> those<00:02:41.910> you

00:02:42.770 --> 00:02:42.780 
this does not fail as far as those you

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:44.420 
this does not fail as far as those you
know<00:02:42.870> the<00:02:43.020> distance<00:02:43.200> goes<00:02:43.710> it's<00:02:43.980> not<00:02:44.190> like<00:02:44.340> the

00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:44.430 
know the distance goes it's not like the

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:46.370 
know the distance goes it's not like the
mp5<00:02:44.910> where<00:02:45.150> you<00:02:45.240> have<00:02:45.420> to<00:02:45.570> be<00:02:45.690> pretty<00:02:45.960> much<00:02:46.200> on

00:02:46.370 --> 00:02:46.380 
mp5 where you have to be pretty much on

00:02:46.380 --> 00:02:48.830 
mp5 where you have to be pretty much on
top<00:02:46.650> of<00:02:46.800> somebody<00:02:47.130> for<00:02:47.310> it<00:02:47.400> to<00:02:47.550> do<00:02:47.700> good<00:02:47.910> that

00:02:48.830 --> 00:02:48.840 
top of somebody for it to do good that

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:50.600 
top of somebody for it to do good that
gun<00:02:49.350> is<00:02:49.380> kind<00:02:49.650> of<00:02:49.740> strictly<00:02:50.190> for<00:02:50.430> close

00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:50.610 
gun is kind of strictly for close

00:02:50.610 --> 00:02:54.260 
gun is kind of strictly for close
quarters<00:02:50.880> but<00:02:51.590> the<00:02:52.590> UMP<00:02:53.280> is<00:02:53.310> I'm<00:02:53.760> finding<00:02:54.180> out

00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:54.270 
quarters but the UMP is I'm finding out

00:02:54.270 --> 00:02:56.660 
quarters but the UMP is I'm finding out
slowly<00:02:54.660> I<00:02:55.080> think<00:02:55.890> it's<00:02:56.010> going<00:02:56.070> to<00:02:56.160> be<00:02:56.310> good<00:02:56.430> for

00:02:56.660 --> 00:02:56.670 
slowly I think it's going to be good for

00:02:56.670 --> 00:02:58.250 
slowly I think it's going to be good for
a<00:02:56.700> lot<00:02:56.880> of<00:02:56.940> different<00:02:57.360> setups<00:02:57.780> it's<00:02:57.930> not<00:02:58.080> going

00:02:58.250 --> 00:02:58.260 
a lot of different setups it's not going

00:02:58.260 --> 00:03:00.440 
a lot of different setups it's not going
to<00:02:58.350> be<00:02:58.470> just<00:02:58.650> silencer<00:02:59.100> and<00:02:59.130> rapid<00:02:59.520> fire<00:02:59.700> I'm

00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:00.450 
to be just silencer and rapid fire I'm

00:03:00.450 --> 00:03:01.910 
to be just silencer and rapid fire I'm
not<00:03:00.660> even<00:03:00.840> sure<00:03:00.870> if<00:03:01.050> you're<00:03:01.170> gonna<00:03:01.260> need<00:03:01.500> rapid

00:03:01.910 --> 00:03:01.920 
not even sure if you're gonna need rapid

00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:04.460 
not even sure if you're gonna need rapid
fire<00:03:02.130> but<00:03:02.970> from<00:03:03.150> what<00:03:03.270> I<00:03:03.330> you<00:03:03.660> know<00:03:03.780> my

00:03:04.460 --> 00:03:04.470 
fire but from what I you know my

00:03:04.470 --> 00:03:06.470 
fire but from what I you know my
mentality<00:03:04.860> was<00:03:05.040> to<00:03:05.220> get<00:03:05.370> as<00:03:05.460> much<00:03:05.640> as<00:03:06.180> much

00:03:06.470 --> 00:03:06.480 
mentality was to get as much as much

00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:08.300 
mentality was to get as much as much
lead<00:03:06.780> in<00:03:06.930> the<00:03:07.020> air<00:03:07.200> as<00:03:07.350> i<00:03:07.470> can<00:03:07.740> because<00:03:07.890> in<00:03:08.190> this

00:03:08.300 --> 00:03:08.310 
lead in the air as i can because in this

00:03:08.310 --> 00:03:11.300 
lead in the air as i can because in this
game<00:03:08.430> you<00:03:09.390> know<00:03:09.540> it's<00:03:09.780> the<00:03:09.870> lag<00:03:10.680> compensation

00:03:11.300 --> 00:03:11.310 
game you know it's the lag compensation

00:03:11.310 --> 00:03:13.940 
game you know it's the lag compensation
the<00:03:11.670> peer-to-peer<00:03:11.910> crap<00:03:12.540> you<00:03:13.410> know<00:03:13.440> if<00:03:13.740> you're

00:03:13.940 --> 00:03:13.950 
the peer-to-peer crap you know if you're

00:03:13.950 --> 00:03:16.250 
the peer-to-peer crap you know if you're
not<00:03:14.130> the<00:03:14.280> first<00:03:14.700> one<00:03:14.940> shooting<00:03:15.300> chances<00:03:16.110> are

00:03:16.250 --> 00:03:16.260 
not the first one shooting chances are

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:18.170 
not the first one shooting chances are
you're<00:03:16.470> not<00:03:16.560> going<00:03:16.620> to<00:03:16.830> win<00:03:16.980> the<00:03:17.130> fight<00:03:17.370> but<00:03:18.150> I

00:03:18.170 --> 00:03:18.180 
you're not going to win the fight but I

00:03:18.180 --> 00:03:19.610 
you're not going to win the fight but I
kind<00:03:18.390> of<00:03:18.420> pick<00:03:18.600> up<00:03:18.630> here<00:03:18.959> near<00:03:19.140> the<00:03:19.290> end<00:03:19.440> of<00:03:19.560> the

00:03:19.610 --> 00:03:19.620 
kind of pick up here near the end of the

00:03:19.620 --> 00:03:21.949 
kind of pick up here near the end of the
game<00:03:19.650> get<00:03:20.580> my<00:03:20.730> stride<00:03:21.060> on<00:03:21.270> start<00:03:21.630> getting<00:03:21.840> some

00:03:21.949 --> 00:03:21.959 
game get my stride on start getting some

00:03:21.959 --> 00:03:24.440 
game get my stride on start getting some
kill<00:03:22.230> streaks<00:03:22.560> but<00:03:23.340> I'm<00:03:23.790> pretty<00:03:24.000> happy<00:03:24.300> with

00:03:24.440 --> 00:03:24.450 
kill streaks but I'm pretty happy with

00:03:24.450 --> 00:03:26.780 
kill streaks but I'm pretty happy with
what<00:03:24.810> if<00:03:25.440> we're<00:03:25.770> the<00:03:25.800> UMP<00:03:26.100> is<00:03:26.250> right<00:03:26.490> now<00:03:26.640> I'm

00:03:26.780 --> 00:03:26.790 
what if we're the UMP is right now I'm

00:03:26.790 --> 00:03:28.699 
what if we're the UMP is right now I'm
probably<00:03:26.940> be<00:03:27.240> using<00:03:27.390> it<00:03:27.630> as<00:03:27.750> far<00:03:27.930> as<00:03:28.110> my<00:03:28.290> go-to

00:03:28.699 --> 00:03:28.709 
probably be using it as far as my go-to

00:03:28.709 --> 00:03:32.300 
probably be using it as far as my go-to

review<00:03:35.070> on<00:03:35.130> that<00:03:35.490> one<00:03:35.670> I<00:03:35.700> heard<00:03:36.180> it's<00:03:36.330> even

00:03:36.500 --> 00:03:36.510 
review on that one I heard it's even

00:03:36.510 --> 00:03:38.150 
review on that one I heard it's even
better<00:03:36.660> than<00:03:36.750> the<00:03:36.900> mp7<00:03:37.200> since<00:03:37.740> they<00:03:37.890> kicked

00:03:38.150 --> 00:03:38.160 
better than the mp7 since they kicked

00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:40.760 
better than the mp7 since they kicked
down<00:03:38.310> a<00:03:38.550> lot<00:03:39.120> of<00:03:39.150> the<00:03:39.300> recoil<00:03:39.720> still<00:03:40.410> have<00:03:40.560> yet

00:03:40.760 --> 00:03:40.770 
down a lot of the recoil still have yet

00:03:40.770 --> 00:03:45.380 
down a lot of the recoil still have yet
to<00:03:40.830> try<00:03:41.160> the<00:03:41.690> ak-47<00:03:42.860> but<00:03:43.860> I<00:03:44.250> was<00:03:45.120> never<00:03:45.270> really

00:03:45.380 --> 00:03:45.390 
to try the ak-47 but I was never really

00:03:45.390 --> 00:03:47.600 
to try the ak-47 but I was never really
into<00:03:45.810> that<00:03:45.840> gun<00:03:46.200> so<00:03:46.650> much<00:03:46.800> of<00:03:46.980> the<00:03:47.070> kick<00:03:47.580> and

00:03:47.600 --> 00:03:47.610 
into that gun so much of the kick and

00:03:47.610 --> 00:03:50.120 
into that gun so much of the kick and
the<00:03:47.820> recoil<00:03:48.240> just<00:03:48.390> a<00:03:48.480> visual<00:03:48.720> recoil<00:03:49.290> it's

00:03:50.120 --> 00:03:50.130 
the recoil just a visual recoil it's

00:03:50.130 --> 00:03:52.760 
the recoil just a visual recoil it's
enough<00:03:50.490> to<00:03:50.610> make<00:03:50.640> it<00:03:50.970> I<00:03:51.270> don't<00:03:51.630> know<00:03:51.770> it's

00:03:52.760 --> 00:03:52.770 
enough to make it I don't know it's

00:03:52.770 --> 00:03:56.090 
enough to make it I don't know it's
really<00:03:52.920> frustrating<00:03:53.250> for<00:03:53.760> me<00:03:53.820> but<00:03:54.800> as<00:03:55.800> far<00:03:56.040> as

00:03:56.090 --> 00:03:56.100 
really frustrating for me but as far as

00:03:56.100 --> 00:03:59.060 
really frustrating for me but as far as
the<00:03:56.400> setups<00:03:56.940> on<00:03:57.090> this<00:03:57.300> go<00:03:57.510> rapid<00:03:58.470> fire<00:03:58.620> like<00:03:58.980> i

00:03:59.060 --> 00:03:59.070 
the setups on this go rapid fire like i

00:03:59.070 --> 00:04:00.530 
the setups on this go rapid fire like i
said<00:03:59.280> i<00:03:59.310> don't<00:03:59.520> think<00:03:59.760> it's<00:03:59.880> really<00:04:00.150> needed

00:04:00.530 --> 00:04:00.540 
said i don't think it's really needed

00:04:00.540 --> 00:04:02.660 
said i don't think it's really needed
silencer<00:04:01.140> is<00:04:01.320> good<00:04:01.590> i'm<00:04:02.040> finding<00:04:02.490> out<00:04:02.550> the

00:04:02.660 --> 00:04:02.670 
silencer is good i'm finding out the

00:04:02.670 --> 00:04:05.060 
silencer is good i'm finding out the
silencer<00:04:03.150> on<00:04:03.180> most<00:04:03.510> of<00:04:03.630> these<00:04:03.750> guns<00:04:04.650> after<00:04:04.980> the

00:04:05.060 --> 00:04:05.070 
silencer on most of these guns after the

00:04:05.070 --> 00:04:07.040 
silencer on most of these guns after the
Buffs<00:04:05.280> even<00:04:05.730> before<00:04:05.850> the<00:04:06.150> bus<00:04:06.330> getting<00:04:06.870> rid<00:04:06.990> of

00:04:07.040 --> 00:04:07.050 
Buffs even before the bus getting rid of

00:04:07.050 --> 00:04:08.740 
Buffs even before the bus getting rid of
the<00:04:07.110> muzzle<00:04:07.470> flash<00:04:07.500> is<00:04:07.890> really<00:04:08.160> important

00:04:08.740 --> 00:04:08.750 
the muzzle flash is really important

00:04:08.750 --> 00:04:11.150 
the muzzle flash is really important
simply<00:04:09.750> because<00:04:09.870> it's<00:04:10.230> just<00:04:10.440> easier<00:04:10.830> to<00:04:10.890> see

00:04:11.150 --> 00:04:11.160 
simply because it's just easier to see

00:04:11.160 --> 00:04:13.370 
simply because it's just easier to see
your<00:04:11.310> target<00:04:11.670> I<00:04:11.820> tried<00:04:12.480> the<00:04:12.570> mp5<00:04:12.959> without<00:04:13.290> the

00:04:13.370 --> 00:04:13.380 
your target I tried the mp5 without the

00:04:13.380 --> 00:04:15.650 
your target I tried the mp5 without the
muzzle<00:04:13.560> flash<00:04:13.890> and<00:04:14.220> it<00:04:14.310> just<00:04:14.520> I<00:04:14.730> don't<00:04:15.420> know<00:04:15.600> I

00:04:15.650 --> 00:04:15.660 
muzzle flash and it just I don't know I

00:04:15.660 --> 00:04:18.590 
muzzle flash and it just I don't know I
just<00:04:15.780> I<00:04:16.049> couldn't<00:04:16.260> get<00:04:16.440> on<00:04:16.560> target<00:04:16.950> but<00:04:17.600> the

00:04:18.590 --> 00:04:18.600 
just I couldn't get on target but the

00:04:18.600 --> 00:04:21.080 
just I couldn't get on target but the
sights<00:04:18.870> on<00:04:19.049> the<00:04:19.169> UMP<00:04:19.530> are<00:04:19.680> really<00:04:19.919> clear<00:04:20.250> don't

00:04:21.080 --> 00:04:21.090 
sights on the UMP are really clear don't

00:04:21.090 --> 00:04:23.659 
sights on the UMP are really clear don't
really<00:04:21.330> think<00:04:21.450> I<00:04:21.570> need<00:04:21.750> a<00:04:21.780> red<00:04:22.020> dot<00:04:22.260> but<00:04:23.010> now<00:04:23.370> I

00:04:23.659 --> 00:04:23.669 
really think I need a red dot but now I

00:04:23.669 --> 00:04:25.280 
really think I need a red dot but now I
want<00:04:24.180> have<00:04:24.270> to<00:04:24.360> try<00:04:24.510> out<00:04:24.630> have<00:04:24.720> done<00:04:24.840> a<00:04:25.020> bunch

00:04:25.280 --> 00:04:25.290 
want have to try out have done a bunch

00:04:25.290 --> 00:04:27.590 
want have to try out have done a bunch
of<00:04:25.500> different<00:04:25.890> setups<00:04:26.280> just<00:04:26.520> to<00:04:26.640> see<00:04:26.880> you<00:04:27.570> know

00:04:27.590 --> 00:04:27.600 
of different setups just to see you know

00:04:27.600 --> 00:04:29.690 
of different setups just to see you know
what<00:04:28.080> I<00:04:28.110> feel<00:04:28.380> is<00:04:28.590> good<00:04:28.979> and<00:04:29.220> what<00:04:29.280> I<00:04:29.460> feel

00:04:29.690 --> 00:04:29.700 
what I feel is good and what I feel

00:04:29.700 --> 00:04:33.020 
what I feel is good and what I feel
isn't<00:04:30.030> good<00:04:30.210> but<00:04:31.010> like<00:04:32.010> I<00:04:32.130> said<00:04:32.160> infinity<00:04:32.820> ward

00:04:33.020 --> 00:04:33.030 
isn't good but like I said infinity ward

00:04:33.030 --> 00:04:34.909 
isn't good but like I said infinity ward
I<00:04:33.270> think<00:04:34.080> this<00:04:34.200> is<00:04:34.320> the<00:04:34.410> first<00:04:34.440> time<00:04:34.770> they've

00:04:34.909 --> 00:04:34.919 
I think this is the first time they've

00:04:34.919 --> 00:04:36.110 
I think this is the first time they've
actually<00:04:35.070> gone<00:04:35.310> through<00:04:35.370> and<00:04:35.700> changed<00:04:36.030> as

00:04:36.110 --> 00:04:36.120 
actually gone through and changed as

00:04:36.120 --> 00:04:38.150 
actually gone through and changed as
many<00:04:36.330> guns<00:04:36.510> I've<00:04:36.750> know<00:04:36.900> they<00:04:37.050> change<00:04:37.380> the<00:04:37.560> LMGs

00:04:38.150 --> 00:04:38.160 
many guns I've know they change the LMGs

00:04:38.160 --> 00:04:40.370 
many guns I've know they change the LMGs
before<00:04:38.640> you<00:04:39.390> screw<00:04:39.720> it<00:04:39.780> around<00:04:40.080> with<00:04:40.290> the

00:04:40.370 --> 00:04:40.380 
before you screw it around with the

00:04:40.380 --> 00:04:41.840 
before you screw it around with the
damage<00:04:40.710> on<00:04:40.830> that<00:04:40.890> I<00:04:41.100> think<00:04:41.340> they<00:04:41.400> buffed<00:04:41.669> them

00:04:41.840 --> 00:04:41.850 
damage on that I think they buffed them

00:04:41.850 --> 00:04:43.909 
damage on that I think they buffed them
once<00:04:42.090> then<00:04:42.810> they<00:04:43.020> nerfed<00:04:43.320> and<00:04:43.470> once<00:04:43.650> they've

00:04:43.909 --> 00:04:43.919 
once then they nerfed and once they've

00:04:43.919 --> 00:04:45.740 
once then they nerfed and once they've
messed<00:04:44.130> around<00:04:44.340> with<00:04:44.610> the<00:04:44.789> FM<00:04:45.090> GS<00:04:45.390> I<00:04:45.570> think

00:04:45.740 --> 00:04:45.750 
messed around with the FM GS I think

00:04:45.750 --> 00:04:46.969 
messed around with the FM GS I think
they<00:04:45.840> nerf<00:04:46.080> that<00:04:46.320> and<00:04:46.470> also<00:04:46.560> think<00:04:46.890> they

00:04:46.969 --> 00:04:46.979 
they nerf that and also think they

00:04:46.979 --> 00:04:51.260 
they nerf that and also think they
nerfed<00:04:47.280> the<00:04:48.270> striker<00:04:48.770> which<00:04:49.789> I'm<00:04:50.789> okay<00:04:51.090> with

00:04:51.260 --> 00:04:51.270 
nerfed the striker which I'm okay with

00:04:51.270 --> 00:04:54.260 
nerfed the striker which I'm okay with
that<00:04:51.530> I'm<00:04:52.530> not<00:04:52.710> too<00:04:52.950> I'm<00:04:53.550> not<00:04:53.729> a<00:04:53.760> big<00:04:53.970> fan<00:04:54.000> of

00:04:54.260 --> 00:04:54.270 
that I'm not too I'm not a big fan of

00:04:54.270 --> 00:04:57.140 
that I'm not too I'm not a big fan of
the<00:04:54.570> full<00:04:55.500> yacht<00:04:55.770> or<00:04:55.950> semi<00:04:56.460> auto<00:04:56.610> spammable

00:04:59.600 --> 00:04:59.610 
shotguns in these games kind of cheesy

00:04:59.610 --> 00:05:01.520 
shotguns in these games kind of cheesy
