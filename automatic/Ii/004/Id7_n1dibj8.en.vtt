00:00:01.879 --> 00:00:08.309
 let's see today how to read the time 

00:00:06.359 --> 00:00:12.450
 the clock face is composed of 

00:00:08.309 --> 00:00:16.020
 twelve numbers ranging from 1 to 12 ha 

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:21.600
 then two hands the shorter red one 

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:26.099
 signal hours that long blue breast 

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:28.619
 instead minutes the movement of 

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:34.020
 hands follows the indicated direction 

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:36.989
 by the black arrow between a number and 

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:41.940
 the more we see these many dots 

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:45.239
 dots indicate the minute symbols when 

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:50.460
 the blue arrow makes a full circle 

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:52.850
 of the dial means that it has passed 

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:52.850
 an hour 

00:00:53.820 --> 00:01:01.020
 the clock will then appear in 

00:00:55.739 --> 00:01:04.049
 this way the hour hand will be 

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:07.650
 positioned on number 4 while that 

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:10.460
 of minutes will be back in the 

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:10.460
 start point 

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:18.320
 we will now try to read the clock 

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:22.020
 at different times 

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:26.490
 the hour hand 

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:31.229
 in this case it marks the number 6 while 

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:35.040
 the minute hand is positioned in 

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:36.869
 this is the starting point 

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:41.520
 as we said before our 

00:01:36.869 --> 00:01:43.740
 dial is always number 12 if we 

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:46.290
 let's count the dots that 

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:49.500
 correspond to the individual minutes we will see 

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:51.960
 that the blue hand has traveled 10 

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:56.630
 minutes 

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:56.630
 this schedule reads 610 

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:06.840
 if instead we find the red hand 

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:08.319
 bet on the number 12 and the hand 

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:11.540
 blue 

00:02:08.319 --> 00:02:16.120
 on the number 6 

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:20.870
 this now reads 12 and 30 minutes 

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:24.980
 or twelve and a half hands 

00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:29.290
 in fact, Azzurra has traveled halfway 

00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:29.290
 quadrant that is half an hour 

00:02:31.069 --> 00:02:37.819
 now let's see the watch with the hand 

00:02:34.959 --> 00:02:41.049
 red marking the number 10 and the 

00:02:37.819 --> 00:02:44.090
 blue hand that marks the number two 

00:02:41.049 --> 00:02:50.590
 since the minute hand is always 

00:02:44.090 --> 00:02:54.560
 started from point 12 of the watch 

00:02:50.590 --> 00:02:58.640
 this time is read as 10 and 10 

00:02:54.560 --> 00:03:01.940
 minutes the journey in fact completed 

00:02:58.640 --> 00:03:08.030
 from the blue hand that marks minutes 

00:03:01.940 --> 00:03:10.120
 is this in the other quadrant we go 

00:03:08.030 --> 00:03:17.030
 instead to see another situation 

00:03:10.120 --> 00:03:28.790
 particular the three because the hand 

00:03:17.030 --> 00:03:33.709
 of signal hours 3 and 45 minutes since 

00:03:28.790 --> 00:03:36.160
 the whole day lasts 24 hours 

00:03:33.709 --> 00:03:41.410
 we must remember that the clock 

00:03:36.160 --> 00:03:44.389
 instead it indicates only one half that is 12 hours 

00:03:41.410 --> 00:03:48.530
 the time indicated in the clock of 

00:03:44.389 --> 00:03:53.590
 right that is 8 o'clock can be 

00:03:48.530 --> 00:03:58.569
 read also for the evening hours as hours 

00:03:53.590 --> 00:03:58.569
 20 o'clock 

00:04:00.660 --> 00:04:06.930
 simply add the 

00:04:03.270 --> 00:04:12.470
 number 12 that is the 12 hours missing to 

00:04:06.930 --> 00:04:12.470
 number indicated by the red arrow 8 

00:04:13.400 --> 00:04:22.010
 plus 12 is equal to 20 

00:04:23.250 --> 00:04:33.330
 summarizing then we can read 

00:04:25.740 --> 00:04:35.630
 the watch either as 20 o'clock or as 8 

00:04:33.330 --> 00:04:35.630
 in point 

00:04:36.530 --> 00:04:43.950
 the left clock signal 12 and 45 

00:04:40.830 --> 00:04:46.160
 minutes that can also be read 

00:04:43.950 --> 00:04:49.950
 like 12 and three quarters 

00:04:46.160 --> 00:04:53.130
 the clock on the right indicates 12 o'clock 

00:04:49.950 --> 00:04:57.380
 and 15 minutes that can be read 

00:04:53.130 --> 00:04:57.380
 also as 12 and a quarter
