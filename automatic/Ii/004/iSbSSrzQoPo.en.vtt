00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:32.520 
one of the most obvious things when

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:34.550 
one of the most obvious things when
people<00:01:32.760> see<00:01:32.880> the<00:01:33.000> game<00:01:33.180> is<00:01:33.210> oh<00:01:33.870> my<00:01:34.080> gosh<00:01:34.260> the

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:34.560 
people see the game is oh my gosh the

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:36.840 
effects and the lighting and the city

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:38.840 
effects and the lighting and the city
looks<00:01:37.050> so<00:01:37.170> beautiful<00:01:37.290> it's<00:01:37.980> very<00:01:38.190> obvious<00:01:38.640> but

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:38.850 
looks so beautiful it's very obvious but

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:40.220 
looks so beautiful it's very obvious but
I<00:01:38.880> think<00:01:39.090> one<00:01:39.180> of<00:01:39.210> the<00:01:39.360> subtle<00:01:39.570> things<00:01:39.900> that's

00:01:40.220 --> 00:01:40.230 
I think one of the subtle things that's

00:01:40.230 --> 00:01:41.810 
I think one of the subtle things that's
really<00:01:40.500> incredibly<00:01:41.160> important<00:01:41.580> about<00:01:41.700> the

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:41.820 
really incredibly important about the

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:44.930 
really incredibly important about the
playstation<00:01:42.300> 4<00:01:42.540> is<00:01:42.780> the<00:01:43.710> new<00:01:43.860> controller<00:01:44.280> and

00:01:44.930 --> 00:01:44.940 
playstation 4 is the new controller and

00:01:44.940 --> 00:01:46.520 
playstation 4 is the new controller and
even<00:01:45.570> on<00:01:45.630> the<00:01:45.720> new<00:01:45.810> controller<00:01:46.110> everybody<00:01:46.470> I

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:46.530 
even on the new controller everybody I

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:47.960 
even on the new controller everybody I
think<00:01:46.770> pays<00:01:46.920> attention<00:01:47.070> to<00:01:47.400> the<00:01:47.580> light<00:01:47.760> bar

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:47.970 
think pays attention to the light bar

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:50.120 
think pays attention to the light bar
and<00:01:48.300> the<00:01:48.420> touchpad<00:01:49.230> and<00:01:49.290> the<00:01:49.680> speaker<00:01:50.100> and

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:50.130 
and the touchpad and the speaker and

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:51.740 
and the touchpad and the speaker and
we're<00:01:50.490> excited<00:01:50.700> about<00:01:50.880> all<00:01:51.000> those<00:01:51.240> things<00:01:51.510> but

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:51.750 
we're excited about all those things but

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:53.990 
we're excited about all those things but
to<00:01:52.200> me<00:01:52.410> the<00:01:52.770> thing<00:01:53.010> that<00:01:53.040> that<00:01:53.640> is<00:01:53.760> the<00:01:53.880> most

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:54.000 
to me the thing that that is the most

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:55.280 
to me the thing that that is the most
profound<00:01:54.330> I<00:01:54.810> think<00:01:54.960> that's<00:01:55.080> the<00:01:55.170> most

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:55.290 
profound I think that's the most

00:01:55.290 --> 00:01:57.110 
profound I think that's the most
important<00:01:55.830> and<00:01:56.040> underappreciated<00:01:56.430> about<00:01:57.030> the

00:01:57.110 --> 00:01:57.120 
important and underappreciated about the

00:01:57.120 --> 00:01:58.880 
important and underappreciated about the
new<00:01:57.240> controller<00:01:57.600> is<00:01:58.320> all<00:01:58.530> the<00:01:58.650> improvements

00:01:58.880 --> 00:01:58.890

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:01.850 
new controller is all the improvements
that<00:01:59.220> the<00:01:59.460> team<00:01:59.670> that<00:02:00.540> worked<00:02:00.780> on<00:02:00.930> it<00:02:01.140> made<00:02:01.500> to

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:01.860 
that the team that worked on it made to

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:03.710 
that the team that worked on it made to
the<00:02:01.980> basics<00:02:02.430> you<00:02:02.850> know<00:02:02.940> one<00:02:03.390> or<00:02:03.480> two<00:02:03.600> hours
