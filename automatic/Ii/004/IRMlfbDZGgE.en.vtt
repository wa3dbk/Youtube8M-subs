in<00:00:42.340> the<00:00:42.399> clinic<00:00:42.610> here<00:00:42.910> really<00:00:43.540> important

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:43.870 
in the clinic here really important

00:00:43.870 --> 00:00:46.290 
in the clinic here really important
muscles<00:00:44.200> important<00:00:44.890> stabilizers<00:00:45.550> so<00:00:45.760> the

00:00:46.290 --> 00:00:46.300 
muscles important stabilizers so the

00:00:46.300 --> 00:00:47.940 
muscles important stabilizers so the
first<00:00:46.540> one<00:00:46.690> we're<00:00:46.840> going<00:00:46.960> to<00:00:47.020> look<00:00:47.110> at<00:00:47.320> is<00:00:47.530> the

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:47.950 
first one we're going to look at is the

00:00:47.950 --> 00:00:50.160 
first one we're going to look at is the
gluteus<00:00:48.280> maximus<00:00:48.460> so<00:00:49.390> we've<00:00:49.510> got<00:00:49.660> Julian<00:00:50.020> here

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:50.170 
gluteus maximus so we've got Julian here

00:00:50.170 --> 00:00:52.350 
gluteus maximus so we've got Julian here
lying<00:00:50.380> flat<00:00:50.590> I'm<00:00:51.520> going<00:00:51.670> to<00:00:51.730> have<00:00:51.850> her<00:00:51.940> pull<00:00:52.239> in

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:52.360 
lying flat I'm going to have her pull in

00:00:52.360 --> 00:00:54.150 
lying flat I'm going to have her pull in
her<00:00:52.510> leg<00:00:52.660> and<00:00:52.960> what<00:00:53.440> you're<00:00:53.559> looking<00:00:53.649> for<00:00:54.070> is

00:00:54.150 --> 00:00:54.160 
her leg and what you're looking for is

00:00:54.160 --> 00:00:55.950 
her leg and what you're looking for is
you<00:00:54.280> want<00:00:54.309> to<00:00:54.550> feel<00:00:54.760> where<00:00:54.970> the<00:00:55.120> tension

00:00:55.950 --> 00:00:55.960 
you want to feel where the tension

00:00:55.960 --> 00:00:57.959 
you want to feel where the tension
starts<00:00:56.559> so<00:00:56.739> this<00:00:56.890> is<00:00:57.070> Julia's<00:00:57.520> quite<00:00:57.730> flexible

00:00:57.959 --> 00:00:57.969 
starts so this is Julia's quite flexible

00:00:57.969 --> 00:01:00.660 
starts so this is Julia's quite flexible
she's<00:00:58.450> a<00:00:58.480> dancer<00:00:58.960> so<00:00:59.200> she<00:00:59.829> can<00:00:59.980> go<00:01:00.100> quite<00:01:00.370> far

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:00.670 
she's a dancer so she can go quite far

00:01:00.670 --> 00:01:02.549 
she's a dancer so she can go quite far
some<00:01:01.329> people<00:01:01.600> who<00:01:01.660> come<00:01:01.809> into<00:01:01.930> the<00:01:02.110> clinic<00:01:02.260> and

00:01:02.549 --> 00:01:02.559 
some people who come into the clinic and

00:01:02.559 --> 00:01:04.619 
some people who come into the clinic and
basically<00:01:02.890> and<00:01:03.190> that<00:01:03.520> would<00:01:03.700> be<00:01:03.790> the<00:01:03.940> starting

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:04.629 
basically and that would be the starting

00:01:04.629 --> 00:01:06.179 
basically and that would be the starting
point<00:01:04.930> so<00:01:05.140> we're<00:01:05.469> going<00:01:05.560> to<00:01:05.619> have<00:01:05.799> it<00:01:05.920> pull<00:01:06.100> it

00:01:06.179 --> 00:01:06.189 
point so we're going to have it pull it

00:01:06.189 --> 00:01:08.069 
point so we're going to have it pull it
in<00:01:06.340> right<00:01:07.180> about<00:01:07.390> here's<00:01:07.630> where<00:01:07.810> I'm<00:01:07.930> feeling

00:01:08.069 --> 00:01:08.079 
in right about here's where I'm feeling

00:01:08.079 --> 00:01:10.319 
in right about here's where I'm feeling
tension<00:01:08.499> and<00:01:08.889> then<00:01:09.280> Julia<00:01:09.670> as<00:01:09.729> well<00:01:09.909> I'm

00:01:10.319 --> 00:01:10.329 
tension and then Julia as well I'm

00:01:10.329 --> 00:01:12.179 
tension and then Julia as well I'm
assuming<00:01:10.780> so<00:01:10.990> what<00:01:11.619> we're<00:01:11.740> going<00:01:11.859> to<00:01:11.889> do<00:01:12.069> is

00:01:12.179 --> 00:01:12.189 
assuming so what we're going to do is

00:01:12.189 --> 00:01:14.639 
assuming so what we're going to do is
have<00:01:12.399> her<00:01:12.549> grasp<00:01:13.450> the<00:01:13.719> knee<00:01:13.840> with<00:01:14.049> both<00:01:14.229> hands

00:01:14.639 --> 00:01:14.649 
have her grasp the knee with both hands

00:01:14.649 --> 00:01:17.399 
have her grasp the knee with both hands
and<00:01:14.819> we're<00:01:15.819> going<00:01:15.939> to<00:01:15.999> incorporate<00:01:16.240> some<00:01:16.689> pmf

00:01:17.399 --> 00:01:17.409 
and we're going to incorporate some pmf

00:01:17.409 --> 00:01:19.919 
and we're going to incorporate some pmf
some<00:01:17.789> proprioceptive<00:01:18.789> nervous<00:01:19.389> iLET<00:01:19.630> ation

00:01:19.919 --> 00:01:19.929 
some proprioceptive nervous iLET ation

00:01:19.929 --> 00:01:21.840 
some proprioceptive nervous iLET ation
basically<00:01:20.560> she's<00:01:21.219> going<00:01:21.399> to<00:01:21.459> offer<00:01:21.609> some

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:21.850 
basically she's going to offer some

00:01:21.850 --> 00:01:24.149 
basically she's going to offer some
resistance<00:01:22.479> holding<00:01:23.409> that<00:01:23.560> for<00:01:23.770> about<00:01:23.829> eight

00:01:24.149 --> 00:01:24.159 
resistance holding that for about eight

00:01:24.159 --> 00:01:26.399 
resistance holding that for about eight
seconds<00:01:24.759> relaxing<00:01:25.600> the<00:01:25.689> muscle<00:01:26.020> and<00:01:26.200> at<00:01:26.289> the

00:01:26.399 --> 00:01:26.409 
seconds relaxing the muscle and at the

00:01:26.409 --> 00:01:28.109 
seconds relaxing the muscle and at the
point<00:01:26.649> where<00:01:26.859> it<00:01:26.920> relaxes<00:01:27.459> we're<00:01:27.880> going<00:01:28.060> to

00:01:28.109 --> 00:01:28.119 
point where it relaxes we're going to

00:01:28.119 --> 00:01:29.340 
point where it relaxes we're going to
take<00:01:28.299> it<00:01:28.420> a<00:01:28.479> little<00:01:28.600> bit<00:01:28.840> further<00:01:29.139> and

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:29.350 
take it a little bit further and

00:01:29.350 --> 00:01:31.649 
take it a little bit further and
increase<00:01:29.709> the<00:01:29.859> range<00:01:29.979> of<00:01:30.100> motion<00:01:30.159> so<00:01:31.119> we're

00:01:31.649 --> 00:01:31.659 
increase the range of motion so we're

00:01:31.659 --> 00:01:33.089 
increase the range of motion so we're
going<00:01:31.749> to<00:01:31.810> start<00:01:32.049> here<00:01:32.350> so<00:01:32.829> we're<00:01:32.920> going<00:01:33.009> to

00:01:33.089 --> 00:01:33.099 
going to start here so we're going to

00:01:33.099 --> 00:01:36.149 
going to start here so we're going to
have<00:01:33.249> her<00:01:33.369> push<00:01:33.700> into<00:01:33.969> her<00:01:34.060> hands<00:01:35.009> you<00:01:36.009> can

00:01:36.149 --> 00:01:36.159 
have her push into her hands you can

00:01:36.159 --> 00:01:37.529 
have her push into her hands you can
also<00:01:36.279> do<00:01:36.520> this<00:01:36.670> assisted<00:01:37.179> if<00:01:37.299> you<00:01:37.389> have<00:01:37.509> a

00:01:37.529 --> 00:01:37.539 
also do this assisted if you have a

00:01:37.539 --> 00:01:39.599 
also do this assisted if you have a
partner<00:01:37.899> route<00:01:38.200> takes<00:01:38.889> my<00:01:39.069> hands<00:01:39.310> here

00:01:39.599 --> 00:01:39.609 
partner route takes my hands here

00:01:39.609 --> 00:01:41.429 
partner route takes my hands here
reinforcing<00:01:40.450> the<00:01:40.569> knee<00:01:40.719> you're<00:01:41.289> going<00:01:41.319> to

00:01:41.429 --> 00:01:41.439 
reinforcing the knee you're going to

00:01:41.439 --> 00:01:42.929 
reinforcing the knee you're going to
have<00:01:41.560> a<00:01:41.619> push<00:01:41.889> in<00:01:42.069> for<00:01:42.189> about<00:01:42.369> eight<00:01:42.490> seconds

00:01:42.929 --> 00:01:42.939 
have a push in for about eight seconds

00:01:42.939 --> 00:01:45.870 
have a push in for about eight seconds
and<00:01:43.719> then<00:01:44.259> relax<00:01:44.560> then<00:01:45.429> you're<00:01:45.549> going<00:01:45.639> to<00:01:45.729> take

00:01:45.870 --> 00:01:45.880 
and then relax then you're going to take

00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:47.459 
and then relax then you're going to take
it<00:01:45.999> just<00:01:46.029> a<00:01:46.450> little<00:01:46.539> bit<00:01:46.779> further<00:01:47.079> within

00:01:47.459 --> 00:01:47.469 
it just a little bit further within

eight<00:01:51.189> seconds<00:01:51.729> and<00:01:52.229> then<00:01:53.229> taking<00:01:53.590> it<00:01:53.679> even

00:01:53.789 --> 00:01:53.799 
eight seconds and then taking it even

00:01:53.799 --> 00:01:57.539 
eight seconds and then taking it even
further<00:01:55.079> and<00:01:56.079> you<00:01:56.799> want<00:01:56.979> to<00:01:57.069> do<00:01:57.189> this<00:01:57.340> about

00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:35.730 
sure that we stretch this up so we do a

00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:37.940 
sure that we stretch this up so we do a
little<00:02:35.880> bit<00:02:36.060> of<00:02:36.090> pmf<00:02:36.930> work<00:02:37.140> on<00:02:37.260> it<00:02:37.440> so<00:02:37.769> we're

00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:37.950 
little bit of pmf work on it so we're

00:02:37.950 --> 00:02:39.530 
little bit of pmf work on it so we're
going<00:02:38.250> to<00:02:38.310> take<00:02:38.459> the<00:02:38.850> side<00:02:39.090> here<00:02:39.300> we'll<00:02:39.420> have

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:39.540 
going to take the side here we'll have

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:42.770 
going to take the side here we'll have
Juliet<00:02:39.930> grab<00:02:40.620> her<00:02:40.739> leg<00:02:40.920> here<00:02:41.600> actually<00:02:42.600> on

both<00:02:42.930> both<00:02:43.380> sides<00:02:43.590> here<00:02:43.769> on<00:02:43.950> top<00:02:44.160> and<00:02:44.430> then

00:02:45.050 --> 00:02:45.060 
both both sides here on top and then

00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:47.449 
both both sides here on top and then
we're<00:02:45.180> going<00:02:45.299> to<00:02:45.420> rank<00:02:45.900> in<00:02:46.200> range<00:02:46.590> and<00:02:46.890> then

00:02:47.449 --> 00:02:47.459 
we're going to rank in range and then

00:02:47.459 --> 00:02:48.860 
we're going to rank in range and then
we're<00:02:47.549> going<00:02:47.670> to<00:02:47.700> have<00:02:47.850> her<00:02:48.120> move<00:02:48.510> at<00:02:48.690> this

00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:48.870 
we're going to have her move at this

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:50.780 
we're going to have her move at this
direction<00:02:49.319> so<00:02:49.769> if<00:02:49.830> her<00:02:49.920> hands<00:02:50.130> weren't<00:02:50.370> here<00:02:50.640> I

direction so if her hands weren't here I
mean<00:02:50.970> trying<00:02:51.330> to<00:02:51.390> move<00:02:51.510> it<00:02:51.630> and<00:02:51.750> taking<00:02:52.049> it<00:02:52.080> up

00:02:52.190 --> 00:02:52.200 
mean trying to move it and taking it up

mean trying to move it and taking it up
like<00:02:52.380> that<00:02:52.590> but<00:02:53.130> she's<00:02:53.280> not<00:02:53.430> going<00:02:53.549> to<00:02:53.640> allow

00:02:53.780 --> 00:02:53.790 
like that but she's not going to allow

00:02:53.790 --> 00:02:55.520 
like that but she's not going to allow
it<00:02:53.819> to<00:02:54.090> happen<00:02:54.299> and<00:02:54.660> she's<00:02:54.900> basically<00:02:55.110> going

00:02:55.520 --> 00:02:55.530 
it to happen and she's basically going

00:02:55.530 --> 00:02:57.170 
it to happen and she's basically going
to<00:02:55.620> pull<00:02:55.860> it<00:02:55.980> in<00:02:56.100> and<00:02:56.310> then<00:02:56.850> she's<00:02:56.970> going<00:02:57.090> to

00:02:57.170 --> 00:02:57.180 
to pull it in and then she's going to

00:02:57.180 --> 00:02:59.180 
to pull it in and then she's going to
force<00:02:57.420> it<00:02:57.630> her<00:02:57.959> foot<00:02:58.170> in<00:02:58.319> this<00:02:58.500> direction<00:02:59.010> here

00:02:59.180 --> 00:02:59.190 
force it her foot in this direction here

00:02:59.190 --> 00:03:01.039 
force it her foot in this direction here
try<00:02:59.819> to<00:02:59.880> turn<00:03:00.060> out<00:03:00.239> about<00:03:00.480> a<00:03:00.540> count<00:03:00.780> of<00:03:00.900> eight

00:03:01.039 --> 00:03:01.049 
try to turn out about a count of eight

00:03:01.049 --> 00:03:03.530 
try to turn out about a count of eight
and<00:03:01.290> then<00:03:01.950> after<00:03:02.280> eight<00:03:02.430> she<00:03:03.000> can<00:03:03.120> allow<00:03:03.330> this

00:03:03.530 --> 00:03:03.540 
and then after eight she can allow this

00:03:03.540 --> 00:03:06.800 
and then after eight she can allow this
to<00:03:03.660> go<00:03:03.690> a<00:03:03.810> little<00:03:04.290> bit<00:03:04.799> farther<00:03:05.040> like<00:03:05.340> so<00:03:05.810> now

00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:06.810 
to go a little bit farther like so now

00:03:06.810 --> 00:03:08.569 
to go a little bit farther like so now
we're<00:03:07.019> going<00:03:07.170> to<00:03:07.230> do<00:03:07.319> this<00:03:07.500> whole<00:03:07.890> maybe<00:03:08.250> four

we're going to do this whole maybe four

00:03:08.579 --> 00:03:11.090 
we're going to do this whole maybe four
or<00:03:08.640> five<00:03:08.790> times<00:03:09.140> pushing<00:03:10.140> again<00:03:10.440> from<00:03:10.680> a<00:03:10.769> count

00:03:11.090 --> 00:03:11.100 
or five times pushing again from a count

00:03:11.100 --> 00:03:12.530 
or five times pushing again from a count
of<00:03:11.220> eight<00:03:11.340> and<00:03:11.609> then<00:03:11.880> pulling<00:03:12.120> a<00:03:12.269> little<00:03:12.390> bit

00:03:12.530 --> 00:03:12.540 
of eight and then pulling a little bit

00:03:12.540 --> 00:03:14.690 
of eight and then pulling a little bit
farther<00:03:12.920> but<00:03:13.920> we<00:03:14.160> were<00:03:14.250> setting<00:03:14.430> up<00:03:14.579> here

00:03:14.690 --> 00:03:14.700 
farther but we were setting up here

00:03:31.340 --> 00:03:31.350 
individuals have a little more range of

00:03:31.350 --> 00:03:33.410 
individuals have a little more range of
motion<00:03:31.410> and<00:03:31.950> you're<00:03:32.850> trying<00:03:33.060> to<00:03:33.120> get<00:03:33.180> a<00:03:33.239> little

00:03:35.390 --> 00:03:35.400 
bit more of the rotation aspect

00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:36.920 
bit more of the rotation aspect
throughout<00:03:35.850> the<00:03:36.000> external<00:03:36.480> hip<00:03:36.570> rotators
