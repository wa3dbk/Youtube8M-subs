00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:36.270 
around the instructions but I just

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:39.350

area for my mantis Bay and those black

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:51.310 
area for my mantis Bay and those black
plates<00:00:48.420> for<00:00:48.780> the<00:00:48.809> bottom<00:00:49.219> make<00:00:50.219> a<00:00:50.250> nice<00:00:50.460> little

00:00:51.310 --> 00:00:51.320

00:00:51.320 --> 00:00:59.420 
plates for the bottom make a nice little
runway<00:00:55.969> this<00:00:56.969> part<00:00:57.590> actually<00:00:58.590> comes<00:00:59.100> with<00:00:59.219> the

00:00:59.420 --> 00:00:59.430 
runway this part actually comes with the

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:01.639 
runway this part actually comes with the
Mantis<00:00:59.789> is<00:01:00.059> that<00:01:00.660> nice<00:01:00.870> place<00:01:01.170> where<00:01:01.410> you<00:01:01.500> can

00:01:01.639 --> 00:01:01.649 
Mantis is that nice place where you can

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:04.219 
Mantis is that nice place where you can
actually<00:01:02.239> crouch<00:01:03.239> down<00:01:03.270> the<00:01:03.629> Mantis<00:01:03.960> in<00:01:04.080> its

00:01:04.219 --> 00:01:04.229 
actually crouch down the Mantis in its

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:08.390 
actually crouch down the Mantis in its
dan<00:01:04.439> there<00:01:04.739> it'd<00:01:05.040> be<00:01:05.339> docked<00:01:05.909> on<00:01:06.150> it<00:01:07.280> so<00:01:08.280> it

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:08.400 
dan there it'd be docked on it so it

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:09.859 
dan there it'd be docked on it so it
just<00:01:08.580> goes<00:01:08.700> perfect<00:01:09.270> with<00:01:09.420> the<00:01:09.540> rest<00:01:09.720> of

00:01:09.859 --> 00:01:09.869 
just goes perfect with the rest of

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:16.609 
just goes perfect with the rest of
everything<00:01:10.799> I<00:01:10.890> put<00:01:11.100> there<00:01:15.140> so<00:01:16.140> in<00:01:16.259> terms<00:01:16.439> of

00:01:16.609 --> 00:01:16.619 
everything I put there so in terms of

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:21.170 
everything I put there so in terms of
originality<00:01:17.100> it's<00:01:17.460> not<00:01:19.610> too<00:01:20.610> much<00:01:20.790> my<00:01:21.030> own

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:21.180 
originality it's not too much my own

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:23.749 
originality it's not too much my own
because<00:01:21.630> the<00:01:21.900> wave<00:01:22.710> that<00:01:22.920> gantry<00:01:23.280> said<00:01:23.490> to<00:01:23.580> set

00:01:23.749 --> 00:01:23.759 
because the wave that gantry said to set

00:01:23.759 --> 00:01:26.300 
because the wave that gantry said to set
up<00:01:23.880> the<00:01:24.030> saber<00:01:24.470> this<00:01:25.470> almost<00:01:25.650> looks<00:01:25.860> like<00:01:26.070> it

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:26.310 
up the saber this almost looks like it

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:31.060 
up the saber this almost looks like it
but<00:01:27.829> now<00:01:28.829> it<00:01:29.009> is<00:01:29.040> a<00:01:29.130> much<00:01:29.310> better<00:01:29.340> purpose

00:01:31.060 --> 00:01:31.070 
but now it is a much better purpose

00:01:31.070 --> 00:01:37.810 
but now it is a much better purpose
awesome<00:01:32.070> friggin<00:01:32.430> Bay<00:01:33.890> to<00:01:34.890> put<00:01:35.040> the<00:01:35.159> Madison

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:40.950 
and as you can see the Mantis is

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:46.700 
and as you can see the Mantis is
freaking<00:01:41.490> huge<00:01:42.890> so<00:01:43.890> it<00:01:44.280> needs<00:01:44.909> a<00:01:45.439> really<00:01:46.439> big

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:46.710 
freaking huge so it needs a really big

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:49.789 
freaking huge so it needs a really big
area<00:01:47.130> like<00:01:47.340> this<00:01:48.500> that's<00:01:49.500> the<00:01:49.619> bull
