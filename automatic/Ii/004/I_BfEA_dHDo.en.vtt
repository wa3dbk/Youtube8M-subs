00:01:56.640 --> 00:02:03.050
 up but this is the most curious of all on 

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:05.429
 my opinion 

00:02:03.050 --> 00:02:11.420

00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:26.770
 yourself can 

00:02:24.220 --> 00:02:29.050
 well here is a small description so that can 

00:02:26.770 --> 00:02:31.390
 so how much burst the camera how many 

00:02:29.050 --> 00:02:33.160

00:02:31.390 --> 00:02:36.640
 good 140-180 

00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:38.560
 and 30 frames per second he is not Ukraine 

00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:40.090
 there really is very good and peace 

00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:43.570
 compared with the same tank that 

00:02:40.090 --> 00:02:44.530
 used to be considered just just remember 

00:02:43.570 --> 00:02:46.990
 fog 

00:02:44.530 --> 00:02:49.450

 in 20 minutes he turns 

00:06:20.600 --> 00:06:24.610
 accordingly, that can move 

00:06:22.160 --> 00:06:24.610
 backwards 

00:06:27.390 --> 00:06:31.990
