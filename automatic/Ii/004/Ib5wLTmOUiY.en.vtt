00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:01.699 

right<00:00:00.930> here<00:00:01.170> we're<00:00:01.290> gonna<00:00:01.380> do<00:00:01.469> a<00:00:01.500> dot

00:00:01.699 --> 00:00:01.709 
right here we're gonna do a dot

00:00:01.709 --> 00:00:04.849 
right here we're gonna do a dot
structure<00:00:02.159> for<00:00:02.190> water<00:00:02.669> h2o<00:00:03.589> so<00:00:04.589> let's<00:00:04.710> write

00:00:04.849 --> 00:00:04.859 
structure for water h2o so let's write

00:00:04.859 --> 00:00:08.419 
structure for water h2o so let's write
that<00:00:04.890> down<00:00:05.600> h2o<00:00:06.600> and<00:00:07.589> what<00:00:07.859> we<00:00:07.980> want<00:00:08.160> to<00:00:08.250> find

00:00:08.419 --> 00:00:08.429 
that down h2o and what we want to find

00:00:08.429 --> 00:00:11.000 
that down h2o and what we want to find
out<00:00:08.639> first<00:00:08.970> is<00:00:09.389> how<00:00:10.170> many<00:00:10.349> valence<00:00:10.650> electrons

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:11.010 
out first is how many valence electrons

00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:14.360 
out first is how many valence electrons
does<00:00:11.990> water<00:00:12.990> have<00:00:13.139> so<00:00:13.679> I'm<00:00:13.799> counting<00:00:13.980> all<00:00:14.250> the

00:00:14.360 --> 00:00:14.370 
does water have so I'm counting all the

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:17.240 
does water have so I'm counting all the
outer<00:00:14.580> shell<00:00:14.940> electrons<00:00:15.770> and<00:00:16.770> I'll<00:00:16.890> need<00:00:17.070> my

00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:17.250 
outer shell electrons and I'll need my

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:20.870 
outer shell electrons and I'll need my
periodic<00:00:17.789> table<00:00:18.859> let's<00:00:19.859> see<00:00:20.130> hydrogen's<00:00:20.760> in

00:00:20.870 --> 00:00:20.880 
periodic table let's see hydrogen's in

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:26.080 
periodic table let's see hydrogen's in
Group<00:00:20.910> one<00:00:21.390> so<00:00:21.689> it<00:00:21.810> has<00:00:21.960> one<00:00:22.260> valence<00:00:22.560> electron

00:00:26.080 --> 00:00:26.090 

00:00:26.090 --> 00:00:28.550 

but<00:00:27.090> since<00:00:27.330> there's<00:00:27.510> two<00:00:27.570> hydrogen's<00:00:28.289> I<00:00:28.380> need

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:28.560 
but since there's two hydrogen's I need

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:31.790 
but since there's two hydrogen's I need
to<00:00:28.619> multiply<00:00:28.800> that<00:00:29.310> by<00:00:29.369> two<00:00:29.609> and<00:00:30.529> then<00:00:31.529> way

00:00:31.790 --> 00:00:31.800 
to multiply that by two and then way

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:36.620 
to multiply that by two and then way
over<00:00:31.830> here<00:00:33.710> oxygen<00:00:34.710> has<00:00:35.309> six<00:00:35.880> valence

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:36.630 
over here oxygen has six valence

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:39.950 
over here oxygen has six valence
electrons<00:00:37.380> it's<00:00:37.590> in<00:00:37.710> group<00:00:37.950> 6<00:00:38.280> or<00:00:38.520> 16<00:00:38.910> so<00:00:39.899> it

00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:39.960 
electrons it's in group 6 or 16 so it

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:43.430 
electrons it's in group 6 or 16 so it
has<00:00:40.079> 6<00:00:40.410> outer<00:00:40.680> shell<00:00:41.070> electrons<00:00:41.940> we<00:00:42.930> add<00:00:43.170> those

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:43.440 
has 6 outer shell electrons we add those

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:47.590 
has 6 outer shell electrons we add those
there<00:00:43.890> for<00:00:44.579> a<00:00:44.610> total<00:00:45.059> of<00:00:45.180> 6<00:00:45.510> plus<00:00:45.930> 2<00:00:46.500> times<00:00:46.770> one

00:00:47.590 --> 00:00:47.600 
there for a total of 6 plus 2 times one

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:50.330 
there for a total of 6 plus 2 times one
eight<00:00:48.600> so<00:00:49.379> we<00:00:49.410> have<00:00:49.530> eight<00:00:49.649> total<00:00:50.070> valence

00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:50.340 
eight so we have eight total valence

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:53.569 
eight so we have eight total valence
electrons<00:00:51.059> to<00:00:51.500> satisfy<00:00:52.500> the<00:00:52.559> octet<00:00:52.710> sub<00:00:53.430> all

00:00:53.569 --> 00:00:53.579 
electrons to satisfy the octet sub all

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:56.479 
electrons to satisfy the octet sub all
the<00:00:53.730> H's<00:00:54.059> and<00:00:54.239> O's<00:00:54.420> with<00:00:54.890> we<00:00:55.890> put<00:00:56.129> the<00:00:56.250> least

00:00:56.479 --> 00:00:56.489 
the H's and O's with we put the least

00:00:56.489 --> 00:00:58.810 
the H's and O's with we put the least
electronegative<00:00:56.940> one<00:00:57.570> at<00:00:57.690> the<00:00:57.809> center

00:00:58.810 --> 00:00:58.820 
electronegative one at the center

00:00:58.820 --> 00:01:02.779 
electronegative one at the center
however<00:00:59.820> we've<00:01:00.480> always<00:01:00.719> put<00:01:01.140> hydrogen<00:01:01.920> on<00:01:02.370> the

00:01:02.779 --> 00:01:02.789 
however we've always put hydrogen on the

00:01:02.789 --> 00:01:07.250 
however we've always put hydrogen on the
outside<00:01:03.530> so<00:01:04.530> I'm<00:01:04.680> just<00:01:04.860> gonna<00:01:04.949> draw<00:01:05.220> it<00:01:06.260> and

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:07.260 
outside so I'm just gonna draw it and

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:08.600 
outside so I'm just gonna draw it and
move<00:01:07.560> it<00:01:07.650> over<00:01:07.740> here<00:01:08.010> give<00:01:08.159> us<00:01:08.189> some<00:01:08.430> more<00:01:08.549> room

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:08.610 
move it over here give us some more room

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:16.850 
move it over here give us some more room
H<00:01:09.570> o<00:01:11.180> H<00:01:12.710> assign<00:01:14.210> two<00:01:15.210> electrons<00:01:15.810> to<00:01:16.110> each<00:01:16.320> bond

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:16.860 
H o H assign two electrons to each bond

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:18.679 
H o H assign two electrons to each bond
so<00:01:17.250> we're<00:01:17.369> going<00:01:17.460> to<00:01:17.520> bond<00:01:17.790> it<00:01:17.939> together<00:01:18.090> the

00:01:18.679 --> 00:01:18.689 
so we're going to bond it together the

00:01:18.689 --> 00:01:22.730 
so we're going to bond it together the
covalent<00:01:19.049> bond<00:01:19.500> here<00:01:20.630> so<00:01:21.630> I've<00:01:21.780> used<00:01:21.810> four<00:01:22.409> of

00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:22.740 
covalent bond here so I've used four of

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:26.060 
covalent bond here so I've used four of
my<00:01:23.250> eight<00:01:23.460> so<00:01:24.090> I<00:01:24.119> have<00:01:24.390> four<00:01:24.780> left<00:01:25.070> then

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:26.070 
my eight so I have four left then

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:29.170 
my eight so I have four left then
complete<00:01:26.549> the<00:01:26.729> octets<00:01:27.240> on<00:01:27.630> the<00:01:28.080> outside<00:01:28.500> atoms

00:01:29.170 --> 00:01:29.180 
complete the octets on the outside atoms

00:01:29.180 --> 00:01:33.830 
complete the octets on the outside atoms
we're<00:01:30.180> talking<00:01:30.509> here<00:01:32.060> because<00:01:33.060> oxygen<00:01:33.630> needs

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:33.840 
we're talking here because oxygen needs

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:36.140 
we're talking here because oxygen needs
eight<00:01:34.200> hydrogen<00:01:35.070> needs<00:01:35.280> two<00:01:35.640> but<00:01:35.909> it<00:01:36.000> already

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:36.150 
eight hydrogen needs two but it already

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:39.130 
eight hydrogen needs two but it already
has<00:01:36.540> two<00:01:36.900> so<00:01:37.590> I've<00:01:37.680> completed<00:01:38.009> the<00:01:38.340> octets<00:01:38.490> and

00:01:39.130 --> 00:01:39.140 
has two so I've completed the octets and

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:45.289 
has two so I've completed the octets and
I've<00:01:40.140> used<00:01:40.500> up<00:01:40.650> all<00:01:40.890> my<00:01:40.920> electrons<00:01:41.579> here<00:01:44.030> so<00:01:45.030> I

00:01:45.289 --> 00:01:45.299 
I've used up all my electrons here so I

00:01:45.299 --> 00:01:47.149 
I've used up all my electrons here so I
think<00:01:45.390> we're<00:01:45.780> okay<00:01:46.049> there<00:01:46.079> let's<00:01:46.860> go<00:01:47.040> ahead

00:01:47.149 --> 00:01:47.159 
think we're okay there let's go ahead

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:50.270 
think we're okay there let's go ahead
and<00:01:47.460> check<00:01:47.670> and<00:01:47.880> see<00:01:47.939> if<00:01:48.390> we<00:01:48.600> have<00:01:49.280> satisfied

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:50.280 
and check and see if we have satisfied

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:52.420 
and check and see if we have satisfied
the<00:01:50.579> outer<00:01:51.000> shells<00:01:51.329> everything's<00:01:51.840> full

00:01:52.420 --> 00:01:52.430 
the outer shells everything's full

00:01:52.430 --> 00:01:57.770 
the outer shells everything's full
oxygen<00:01:53.430> has<00:01:53.790> eight<00:01:55.219> hydrogen<00:01:56.219> has<00:01:56.399> two<00:01:56.880> this

00:01:57.770 --> 00:01:57.780 
oxygen has eight hydrogen has two this

00:01:57.780 --> 00:02:00.050 
oxygen has eight hydrogen has two this
hydrogen<00:01:58.259> also<00:01:58.619> has<00:01:58.979> two<00:01:59.340> and<00:01:59.670> you<00:01:59.790> don't<00:01:59.820> need

00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:00.060 
hydrogen also has two and you don't need

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:02.300 
hydrogen also has two and you don't need
to<00:02:00.149> draw<00:02:00.360> that<00:02:00.390> on<00:02:00.689> a<00:02:00.719> test<00:02:01.020> or<00:02:01.170> a<00:02:01.290> quiz<00:02:01.439> but<00:02:01.799> it

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:02.310 
to draw that on a test or a quiz but it

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:05.630 
to draw that on a test or a quiz but it
is<00:02:02.399> good<00:02:02.579> to<00:02:02.700> check<00:02:03.590> I've<00:02:04.590> used<00:02:04.890> two<00:02:05.159> four<00:02:05.430> six

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:05.640 
is good to check I've used two four six

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:07.910 
is good to check I've used two four six
eight<00:02:05.880> electrons<00:02:06.780> that's<00:02:06.990> all<00:02:07.140> I<00:02:07.170> had

00:02:07.910 --> 00:02:07.920 
eight electrons that's all I had

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:10.850 
eight electrons that's all I had
everything<00:02:08.580> has<00:02:08.729> an<00:02:08.880> octet<00:02:09.600> we're<00:02:10.440> okay<00:02:10.800> so

00:02:10.850 --> 00:02:10.860 
everything has an octet we're okay so

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:13.819 
everything has an octet we're okay so
we're<00:02:11.160> done<00:02:11.340> with<00:02:11.400> water
