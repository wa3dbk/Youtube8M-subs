minutes<00:03:11.420> in<00:03:11.660> length<00:03:11.900> but<00:03:12.620> I'm<00:03:12.740> hoping<00:03:13.040> this

00:03:13.150 --> 00:03:13.160 
minutes in length but I'm hoping this

00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:15.280 
minutes in length but I'm hoping this
album<00:03:13.490> will<00:03:13.550> turn<00:03:13.850> some<00:03:14.180> heads<00:03:14.210> I<00:03:14.900> know

00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:15.290 
album will turn some heads I know

00:03:15.290 --> 00:03:16.710

there's<00:03:15.620> a<00:03:15.680> lot<00:03:15.710> of<00:03:15.830> people<00:03:16.040> that<00:03:16.340> dislike
