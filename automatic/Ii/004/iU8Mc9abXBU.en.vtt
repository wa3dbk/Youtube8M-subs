arrow keys I can go backward and forward

00:04:13.299 --> 00:04:15.630 
arrow keys I can go backward and forward
through<00:04:13.900> all<00:04:14.109> of<00:04:14.140> them<00:04:14.439> and<00:04:14.500> now<00:04:15.190> I've<00:04:15.340> changed

00:04:15.630 --> 00:04:15.640 
through all of them and now I've changed

00:04:26.060 --> 00:04:26.070 
our selection candidate what we're going

00:04:26.070 --> 00:04:28.790 
our selection candidate what we're going
to<00:04:26.160> do<00:04:26.220> is<00:04:26.310> click<00:04:26.460> done<00:04:26.820> right<00:04:27.360> here<00:04:27.840> what<00:04:28.710> does

00:04:36.590 --> 00:04:36.600 
back into loop view we're out of compare

00:04:36.600 --> 00:04:37.970 
back into loop view we're out of compare
as<00:04:36.720> you<00:04:36.810> can<00:04:36.960> see<00:04:37.110> right<00:04:37.140> over<00:04:37.290> here<00:04:37.620> we're<00:04:37.800> in

as you can see right over here we're in

00:04:37.980 --> 00:04:40.340 
as you can see right over here we're in
loop<00:04:38.310> view<00:04:38.730> let's<00:04:39.240> press<00:04:39.480> our<00:04:39.630> tab<00:04:39.870> key<00:04:40.110> so<00:04:40.320> we

00:04:40.340 --> 00:04:40.350 
loop view let's press our tab key so we

00:04:40.350 --> 00:04:42.920 
loop view let's press our tab key so we
can<00:04:40.530> get<00:04:40.620> our<00:04:40.740> stuff<00:04:41.160> back<00:04:41.220> and<00:04:41.820> maybe<00:04:42.720> do<00:04:42.900> a

00:04:42.920 --> 00:04:42.930 
can get our stuff back and maybe do a

00:04:42.930 --> 00:04:45.680 
can get our stuff back and maybe do a
fit<00:04:43.350> up<00:04:43.530> here<00:04:43.590> so<00:04:44.070> we<00:04:44.190> can<00:04:44.310> see<00:04:44.610> it<00:04:44.760> but<00:04:45.630> you

00:04:45.680 --> 00:04:45.690 
fit up here so we can see it but you

00:04:45.690 --> 00:04:47.780

and<00:04:52.950> maybe<00:04:53.190> give<00:04:53.460> it<00:04:53.550> a<00:04:53.610> color<00:04:55.340> if<00:04:56.340> we<00:04:56.580> go<00:04:56.700> back

00:04:56.810 --> 00:04:56.820 
and maybe give it a color if we go back

00:04:56.820 --> 00:04:59.780 
and maybe give it a color if we go back
into<00:04:57.060> grid<00:04:57.390> view<00:04:57.660> you<00:04:58.320> will<00:04:58.440> notice<00:04:58.680> that<00:04:59.669> if

00:04:59.780 --> 00:04:59.790 
into grid view you will notice that if

00:04:59.790 --> 00:05:01.460 
into grid view you will notice that if
we<00:04:59.880> go<00:05:00.000> ahead<00:05:00.210> and<00:05:00.330> press<00:05:00.480> the<00:05:00.750> letter<00:05:00.900> j<00:05:01.440> a

00:05:01.460 --> 00:05:01.470 
we go ahead and press the letter j a

00:05:01.470 --> 00:05:04.610 
we go ahead and press the letter j a
couple<00:05:01.890> of<00:05:01.980> times<00:05:02.190> there's<00:05:03.060> the<00:05:03.240> flag<00:05:03.360> and<00:05:03.780> you

00:05:04.610 --> 00:05:04.620 
couple of times there's the flag and you

00:05:04.620 --> 00:05:06.110 
couple of times there's the flag and you
can<00:05:04.740> see<00:05:04.860> the<00:05:04.980> color<00:05:05.250> around<00:05:05.550> it<00:05:05.790> too<00:05:05.970> is

00:05:06.110 --> 00:05:06.120 
can see the color around it too is

00:05:06.120 --> 00:05:08.600 
can see the color around it too is
changed<00:05:06.660> i<00:05:06.840> like<00:05:07.200> the<00:05:07.230> ability<00:05:07.470> to<00:05:07.770> do<00:05:07.919> that<00:05:08.130> so

00:05:08.600 --> 00:05:08.610 
changed i like the ability to do that so

00:05:08.610 --> 00:05:10.010 
changed i like the ability to do that so
you<00:05:08.669> can<00:05:08.790> change<00:05:09.090> the<00:05:09.240> color<00:05:09.480> and<00:05:09.810> you<00:05:09.870> can

00:05:10.010 --> 00:05:10.020 
you can change the color and you can

00:05:10.020 --> 00:05:11.930 
you can change the color and you can
kind<00:05:10.140> of<00:05:10.260> see<00:05:10.500> it<00:05:10.590> visually<00:05:10.830> so<00:05:11.700> that's

00:05:11.930 --> 00:05:11.940 
kind of see it visually so that's

00:05:11.940 --> 00:05:14.690 
kind of see it visually so that's
compared<00:05:12.540> it<00:05:12.950> gives<00:05:13.950> you<00:05:14.070> the<00:05:14.190> ability<00:05:14.280> to

00:05:14.690 --> 00:05:14.700 
compared it gives you the ability to

00:05:14.700 --> 00:05:17.300 
compared it gives you the ability to
look<00:05:15.120> at<00:05:15.270> several<00:05:15.600> images<00:05:15.990> two<00:05:16.530> or<00:05:16.710> more<00:05:17.040> and

00:05:17.300 --> 00:05:17.310 
look at several images two or more and

00:05:17.310 --> 00:05:19.550
