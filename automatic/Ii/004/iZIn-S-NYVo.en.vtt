00:00:12.049 --> 00:00:12.059 
at golf galaxy it's pretty reasonable

00:00:12.059 --> 00:00:15.079 
at golf galaxy it's pretty reasonable
price<00:00:12.570> it<00:00:13.080> could<00:00:13.469> be<00:00:13.679> i<00:00:13.889> think<00:00:14.190> in<00:00:14.580> my<00:00:14.730> eyes<00:00:14.880> it

00:00:15.079 --> 00:00:15.089 
price it could be i think in my eyes it

00:00:15.089 --> 00:00:17.180 
price it could be i think in my eyes it
could<00:00:15.240> be<00:00:15.330> a<00:00:15.360> little<00:00:15.570> lower<00:00:15.839> but<00:00:16.199> the<00:00:16.980> putter

00:00:17.180 --> 00:00:17.190 
could be a little lower but the putter

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:18.859 
could be a little lower but the putter
is<00:00:17.310> great<00:00:17.580> and<00:00:17.880> i<00:00:18.180> wouldn't<00:00:18.390> be<00:00:18.510> surprised<00:00:18.840> if

00:00:18.859 --> 00:00:18.869 
is great and i wouldn't be surprised if

00:00:18.869 --> 00:00:22.099 
is great and i wouldn't be surprised if
it<00:00:19.109> was<00:00:19.140> higher<00:00:19.410> so<00:00:20.369> on<00:00:20.880> the<00:00:21.150> outside<00:00:21.539> you<00:00:21.900> have

00:00:22.099 --> 00:00:22.109 
it was higher so on the outside you have

00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:25.630 
it was higher so on the outside you have
your<00:00:22.410> leather<00:00:23.480> cover<00:00:24.480> head<00:00:24.810> cover<00:00:25.080> it's<00:00:25.260> great

00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:30.090 
that you have that there one-handed is

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:32.030 
that you have that there one-handed is
pretty<00:00:30.300> difficult<00:00:30.510> you<00:00:31.289> have<00:00:31.320> the<00:00:31.560> magnetic

00:00:32.030 --> 00:00:32.040
