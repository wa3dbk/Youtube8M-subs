more efficient in a battle just because

00:00:55.179 --> 00:00:56.939

00:00:56.939 --> 00:00:56.949 
you've got that upgrade lead making each

00:00:56.949 --> 00:00:59.340 
you've got that upgrade lead making each
interval<00:00:57.399> in<00:00:57.609> dividual<00:00:58.149> unit<00:00:58.539> stronger<00:00:58.960> and<00:00:59.140> a

00:01:01.529 --> 00:01:01.539 
lot more cost efficient a good example

00:01:01.539 --> 00:01:04.410 
lot more cost efficient a good example

to know how much damage is ogling does
for<00:01:35.300> example<00:01:35.690> you'd<00:01:35.840> go<00:01:36.050> check<00:01:36.290> liquid<00:01:36.620> Peter

00:01:36.790 --> 00:01:36.800 
for example you'd go check liquid Peter
