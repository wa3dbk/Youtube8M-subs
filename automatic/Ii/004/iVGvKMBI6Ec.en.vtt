alright here's my new but set collection
I<00:00:07.370> wasn't<00:00:08.370> sure<00:00:08.490> if<00:00:08.550> anybody<00:00:08.820> interested<00:00:09.450> in

00:00:09.530 --> 00:00:09.540

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:11.120 
I wasn't sure if anybody interested in
this<00:00:09.720> or<00:00:09.900> not<00:00:09.930> so<00:00:10.320> I<00:00:10.349> guess<00:00:10.530> we'll<00:00:10.710> find<00:00:10.950> out

00:00:11.120 --> 00:00:11.130 
this or not so I guess we'll find out

00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:13.070 
this or not so I guess we'll find out
isn't<00:00:11.730> the<00:00:11.850> first<00:00:12.000> time<00:00:12.210> I<00:00:12.270> put<00:00:12.540> something<00:00:12.780> up

00:00:13.070 --> 00:00:13.080 
isn't the first time I put something up

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:15.680 
isn't the first time I put something up

but sets are just lineman's tools guys
that<00:00:19.650> are<00:00:19.710> working<00:00:19.950> on<00:00:20.039> telephone<00:00:20.490> lines<00:00:20.789> up

that are working on telephone lines up

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:22.400 
that are working on telephone lines up
on<00:00:21.240> the<00:00:21.300> telephone<00:00:21.600> pole<00:00:21.990> in<00:00:22.020> your<00:00:22.289> house

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:22.410 
on the telephone pole in your house

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:24.920 
on the telephone pole in your house
whatever<00:00:22.860> if<00:00:23.699> they<00:00:23.820> need<00:00:24.030> to<00:00:24.240> test<00:00:24.630> to<00:00:24.750> see<00:00:24.780> if

00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:24.930 
whatever if they need to test to see if

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:28.880 
whatever if they need to test to see if
the<00:00:25.080> line<00:00:25.260> works<00:00:25.699> you<00:00:26.699> can<00:00:26.880> jack<00:00:27.150> into<00:00:27.420> the<00:00:28.050> you

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:28.890 
the line works you can jack into the you

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:30.859 
the line works you can jack into the you
know<00:00:28.980> the<00:00:29.100> leads<00:00:29.310> on<00:00:29.789> the<00:00:30.029> phone<00:00:30.210> jack<00:00:30.480> or<00:00:30.779> on

00:00:30.859 --> 00:00:30.869 
know the leads on the phone jack or on

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:33.889 
know the leads on the phone jack or on
the<00:00:31.020> pole<00:00:31.199> or<00:00:31.590> wherever<00:00:31.830> and<00:00:32.600> you<00:00:33.600> know<00:00:33.719> make<00:00:33.870> a

00:00:33.889 --> 00:00:33.899 
the pole or wherever and you know make a

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:36.290 
the pole or wherever and you know make a
connection<00:00:34.260> they<00:00:34.949> have<00:00:35.039> a<00:00:35.070> dial<00:00:35.489> so<00:00:36.030> that<00:00:36.149> you

00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:36.300 
connection they have a dial so that you

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:39.110 
connection they have a dial so that you
can<00:00:36.539> make<00:00:36.989> a<00:00:37.019> phone<00:00:37.289> call<00:00:37.589> even<00:00:38.489> the<00:00:38.729> old<00:00:38.879> one

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:39.120 
can make a phone call even the old one

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:41.779 
can make a phone call even the old one
has<00:00:39.420> a<00:00:39.449> switch<00:00:40.440> so<00:00:40.649> you<00:00:40.710> can<00:00:40.800> either<00:00:41.039> use<00:00:41.399> it

00:00:41.779 --> 00:00:41.789 
has a switch so you can either use it

00:00:41.789 --> 00:00:44.209 
has a switch so you can either use it
like<00:00:41.969> a<00:00:41.999> telephone<00:00:42.300> or<00:00:42.510> just<00:00:42.899> monitor<00:00:43.409> it<00:00:43.440> so<00:00:44.190> I

00:00:44.209 --> 00:00:44.219 
like a telephone or just monitor it so I

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:46.009 
like a telephone or just monitor it so I
guess<00:00:44.489> potentially<00:00:45.149> these<00:00:45.329> are<00:00:45.449> also<00:00:45.569> line

00:00:46.009 --> 00:00:46.019 
guess potentially these are also line

00:00:46.019 --> 00:00:49.099 
guess potentially these are also line
taps<00:00:46.350> in<00:00:46.620> a<00:00:46.679> way<00:00:46.829> I<00:00:47.179> doubt<00:00:48.179> that<00:00:48.479> police<00:00:48.839> use

00:00:49.099 --> 00:00:49.109 
taps in a way I doubt that police use

00:00:49.109 --> 00:00:51.110 
taps in a way I doubt that police use
these<00:00:49.440> I'm<00:00:49.859> sure<00:00:50.069> nowadays<00:00:50.579> for<00:00:50.789> sure<00:00:50.969> they

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:51.120 
these I'm sure nowadays for sure they

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:52.849 
these I'm sure nowadays for sure they
use<00:00:51.269> something<00:00:51.479> much<00:00:51.780> more<00:00:51.989> electronic<00:00:52.620> but

00:00:52.849 --> 00:00:52.859 
use something much more electronic but

00:00:52.859 --> 00:00:55.099 
use something much more electronic but
even<00:00:53.549> back<00:00:53.699> in<00:00:53.909> the<00:00:54.030> day<00:00:54.210> I<00:00:54.239> doubt<00:00:54.659> that<00:00:54.899> too

00:00:55.099 --> 00:00:55.109 
even back in the day I doubt that too

00:00:55.109 --> 00:00:56.779 
even back in the day I doubt that too
many<00:00:55.289> police<00:00:55.620> would<00:00:55.829> use<00:00:56.010> these<00:00:56.219> unless<00:00:56.459> it

00:00:56.779 --> 00:00:56.789 
many police would use these unless it

00:00:56.789 --> 00:00:58.520 
many police would use these unless it
was<00:00:56.940> something<00:00:57.329> done<00:00:57.510> in<00:00:57.690> haste<00:00:57.899> or<00:00:58.289> you<00:00:58.409> know

00:00:58.520 --> 00:00:58.530 
was something done in haste or you know

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:01.340 
was something done in haste or you know
on<00:00:58.769> the<00:00:59.100> fly<00:00:59.370> so<00:01:00.239> anyway<00:01:00.449> this<00:01:00.690> one<00:01:00.899> was<00:01:01.019> really

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:01.350 
on the fly so anyway this one was really

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:02.869 
on the fly so anyway this one was really
old<00:01:01.499> well<00:01:01.889> I<00:01:01.920> had<00:01:02.129> one<00:01:02.280> like<00:01:02.399> this<00:01:02.579> when<00:01:02.729> I<00:01:02.760> was

00:01:02.869 --> 00:01:02.879 
old well I had one like this when I was

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:05.149 
old well I had one like this when I was
a<00:01:02.940> kid<00:01:03.179> got<00:01:03.809> this<00:01:03.989> one<00:01:04.170> I<00:01:04.199> need<00:01:04.290> a<00:01:04.409> real<00:01:04.739> cheap<00:01:05.010> a

00:01:05.149 --> 00:01:05.159 
a kid got this one I need a real cheap a

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:07.310 
a kid got this one I need a real cheap a
while<00:01:05.339> back<00:01:05.580> and<00:01:05.880> I<00:01:06.479> thought<00:01:06.690> I'd<00:01:06.840> complete<00:01:07.200> my

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:07.320 
while back and I thought I'd complete my

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:09.200 
while back and I thought I'd complete my
collection<00:01:07.380> so<00:01:08.070> I<00:01:08.100> got<00:01:08.370> this<00:01:08.550> blue<00:01:08.820> one<00:01:09.000> which

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:09.210 
collection so I got this blue one which

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:10.700 
collection so I got this blue one which
i<00:01:09.360> think<00:01:09.420> is<00:01:09.690> cool<00:01:09.870> cuz<00:01:10.140> it's<00:01:10.290> got<00:01:10.440> the<00:01:10.620> old

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:10.710 
i think is cool cuz it's got the old

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:13.610 
i think is cool cuz it's got the old
dial<00:01:11.070> on<00:01:11.370> it<00:01:11.750> so<00:01:12.750> again<00:01:12.840> it's<00:01:13.110> more<00:01:13.410> modern

00:01:13.610 --> 00:01:13.620 
dial on it so again it's more modern

00:01:13.620 --> 00:01:16.520 
dial on it so again it's more modern
than<00:01:14.010> this<00:01:14.190> first<00:01:14.460> one<00:01:14.790> which<00:01:15.480> has<00:01:15.750> a<00:01:16.200> really

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:16.530 
than this first one which has a really

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:19.100 
than this first one which has a really
small<00:01:16.980> dial<00:01:17.340> you<00:01:18.090> basically<00:01:18.480> need<00:01:18.750> to<00:01:18.900> use<00:01:19.080> a

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:19.110 
small dial you basically need to use a

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:21.830 
small dial you basically need to use a
pen<00:01:19.590> if<00:01:20.520> there<00:01:20.760> are<00:01:20.850> little<00:01:21.030> nubs<00:01:21.390> there<00:01:21.660> so

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:21.840 
pen if there are little nubs there so

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:24.980 
pen if there are little nubs there so
you<00:01:21.930> can<00:01:22.080> use<00:01:22.230> your<00:01:22.380> fingers<00:01:23.150> but<00:01:24.150> it's<00:01:24.840> really

00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:24.990 
you can use your fingers but it's really

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:28.820 
you can use your fingers but it's really
made<00:01:25.200> to<00:01:25.230> use<00:01:25.500> a<00:01:25.530> pen<00:01:25.860> and<00:01:27.260> this<00:01:28.260> one's<00:01:28.500> again

00:01:28.820 --> 00:01:28.830 
made to use a pen and this one's again

00:01:28.830 --> 00:01:31.880 
made to use a pen and this one's again
more<00:01:29.040> modern<00:01:29.460> probably<00:01:30.030> too<00:01:30.120> 70s<00:01:30.800> with<00:01:31.800> the

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:31.890 
more modern probably too 70s with the

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:34.930 
more modern probably too 70s with the
regular<00:01:32.250> dial<00:01:32.520> there<00:01:32.850> and<00:01:33.530> it's<00:01:34.530> monitored

00:01:34.930 --> 00:01:34.940 
regular dial there and it's monitored

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:38.240 
regular dial there and it's monitored
talks<00:01:35.940> which<00:01:36.240> nothing<00:01:37.230> else<00:01:37.380> to<00:01:37.620> that<00:01:37.800> one<00:01:38.010> and

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:38.250 
talks which nothing else to that one and

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:40.130 
talks which nothing else to that one and
then<00:01:38.790> this<00:01:38.970> more<00:01:39.210> modern<00:01:39.600> one<00:01:39.780> which<00:01:39.990> I'm

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:40.140 
then this more modern one which I'm

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:42.230 
then this more modern one which I'm
guessing<00:01:40.320> is<00:01:40.590> maybe<00:01:40.800> well<00:01:41.640> maybe<00:01:41.670> this<00:01:42.030> one's

00:01:42.230 --> 00:01:42.240 
guessing is maybe well maybe this one's

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:43.880 
guessing is maybe well maybe this one's
more<00:01:42.450> of<00:01:42.540> the<00:01:42.600> 70s<00:01:43.140> this<00:01:43.260> one<00:01:43.440> might<00:01:43.590> be<00:01:43.620> more

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:43.890 
more of the 70s this one might be more

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:46.640 
more of the 70s this one might be more
than<00:01:43.980> the<00:01:44.070> 60s<00:01:44.550> and<00:01:44.850> this<00:01:45.600> one<00:01:45.870> again<00:01:46.260> has<00:01:46.440> the

00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:46.650 
than the 60s and this one again has the

00:01:46.650 --> 00:01:47.840 
than the 60s and this one again has the
monitor<00:01:47.100> or<00:01:47.280> talk
