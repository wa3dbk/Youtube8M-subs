00:00:13.849 --> 00:00:15.950
 end when I put his office I 

00:00:15.019 --> 00:00:17.660
 always hungry 

00:00:15.950 --> 00:00:19.340
 it's true that the main bento 

00:00:17.660 --> 00:00:20.900
 it is to sell well etc and 

00:00:19.340 --> 00:00:22.039

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:41.989
 starchy which is very important 

00:00:40.070 --> 00:00:43.340
 our interest is to have a lot of 

00:00:41.989 --> 00:00:45.079

00:00:55.399 --> 00:01:01.879
 small pouch from which he originated 

00:00:58.699 --> 00:01:03.920
 and go on both floors if you want 

00:01:01.879 --> 00:01:06.590
 stay in the philosophy of bento 

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:09.200

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:14.030
 phase 6 actually we are working flat 

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:14.659
 working as on notions 

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:21.619
 balanced 

00:01:14.659 --> 00:01:23.509
 ok that's what these darlings maintain 

00:01:21.619 --> 00:01:26.240
 Here we will add to our 

00:01:23.509 --> 00:01:33.110
 raw vegetables the raw you make a long 

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:42.950
 ribbon the little trick he wraps around 

00:01:33.110 --> 00:01:45.110
 of tiny black is beautiful is 

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:47.119
 important should put it in a sense 

00:01:45.110 --> 00:01:48.330
 it's reindeer lunar inventor education 

00:01:47.119 --> 00:01:50.160
 and isme two years 

00:01:48.330 --> 00:01:52.260
 a rate is very important it's okay 

00:01:50.160 --> 00:01:54.780
 Too cute then it's a little chick 

00:01:52.260 --> 00:01:57.420
 in quail egg tutelle that you do not have 

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:59.370
 makes a video raises to do with 

00:01:57.420 --> 00:02:01.080
 carrots nori leaf and they 

00:01:59.370 --> 00:02:03.090
 killing field of O caravan that's it 

00:02:01.080 --> 00:02:06.000
 boat me really we will play the 

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:08.070
 Chur food was nothing of character 

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:09.890
 and benneau thus have a bento with 

00:02:08.070 --> 00:02:11.880
 young man characters all this stuff 

00:02:09.890 --> 00:02:13.500
 now it happens in france but 

00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:14.790
 it's true that at the beginning, well, I 

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:17.190
 brought a lot of things already 

00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:19.170
 so now you have places 

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:21.000
 specialized or even on the internet 

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:22.890
 so here it is a boat because dna 

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:24.720
 very simple there are some who are very 

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:26.130
 further pushed a lot more sought who 

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:29.760
 advise transport we close well then 

00:02:26.130 --> 00:02:30.270
 you shut up well yeah I went to pass 

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:31.770
 in the microwave 

00:02:30.270 --> 00:02:33.240
 then these six people but as there are 

00:02:31.770 --> 00:02:34.530
 even a little waltz and clay 

00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:37.380
 face with the lid you only have to 

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:39.360
 open the valve or like these as 

00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:41.310
 that the water vapor will escape genome 

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:43.020
 a rate of Lamballe therefore defends the bento 

00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:46.470
 is totally hermetic so can 

00:02:43.020 --> 00:02:47.640
 transform if ever seen no you're not going 

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:49.620
 playing football no longer the only 

00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:51.540
 territory it's totally hermetic 

00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:53.430
 and even if we do not trust there is 

00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:55.230
 insulated bento that closes and 

00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:59.130
 who call themselves and who are the 

00:02:55.230 --> 00:03:03.170
 guilty of soups 

00:02:59.130 --> 00:03:03.170
