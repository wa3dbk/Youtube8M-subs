00:04:33.350 --> 00:04:33.360 
very good possession team probably even

00:04:33.360 --> 00:04:35.060 
very good possession team probably even
better<00:04:33.510> the<00:04:33.660> first<00:04:33.810> time<00:04:34.020> we<00:04:34.169> played<00:04:34.289> them<00:04:34.500> so

00:04:35.060 --> 00:04:35.070 
better the first time we played them so

00:04:35.070 --> 00:04:37.310 
better the first time we played them so
we<00:04:35.220> had<00:04:35.340> to<00:04:35.430> do<00:04:35.520> what<00:04:35.669> we<00:04:35.760> have<00:04:35.910> to<00:04:36.030> do<00:04:36.229> we<00:04:37.229> had

00:04:37.310 --> 00:04:37.320 
we had to do what we have to do we had

00:04:37.320 --> 00:04:39.830 
we had to do what we have to do we had
to<00:04:37.349> make<00:04:37.849> subs<00:04:38.849> that<00:04:39.060> could<00:04:39.210> get<00:04:39.330> the<00:04:39.450> job<00:04:39.660> done

00:04:39.830 --> 00:04:39.840 
to make subs that could get the job done

00:04:39.840 --> 00:04:41.270 
to make subs that could get the job done
for<00:04:40.050> us<00:04:40.169> tonight<00:04:40.289> and<00:04:40.500> I<00:04:40.560> think<00:04:40.620> they<00:04:40.889> did<00:04:40.950> for

00:04:41.270 --> 00:04:41.280 
for us tonight and I think they did for

00:04:41.280 --> 00:04:44.960 
for us tonight and I think they did for
the<00:04:41.370> most<00:04:41.580> part<00:04:41.880> just<00:04:43.070> we<00:04:44.070> defended<00:04:44.580> they

00:04:44.960 --> 00:04:44.970 
the most part just we defended they

00:04:44.970 --> 00:04:46.730 
the most part just we defended they
attack<00:04:45.300> we<00:04:45.479> defend<00:04:45.810> we<00:04:45.990> counter<00:04:46.380> you<00:04:46.710> know

00:04:46.730 --> 00:04:46.740 
attack we defend we counter you know

00:04:46.740 --> 00:04:48.260 
attack we defend we counter you know
certainly<00:04:47.160> that<00:04:47.310> game<00:04:47.490> everybody<00:04:47.910> watching

00:04:48.260 --> 00:04:48.270 
certainly that game everybody watching

00:04:48.270 --> 00:04:49.610 
certainly that game everybody watching
they<00:04:48.570> could<00:04:48.750> have<00:04:48.840> gone<00:04:48.960> either<00:04:49.169> ways<00:04:49.410> and

00:04:49.610 --> 00:04:49.620 
they could have gone either ways and

00:04:49.620 --> 00:04:50.839 
they could have gone either ways and
we're<00:04:49.740> happy<00:04:49.889> to<00:04:50.039> get<00:04:50.130> the<00:04:50.280> points<00:04:50.550> it<00:04:50.639> cuz<00:04:50.729> it

00:04:50.839 --> 00:04:50.849 
we're happy to get the points it cuz it

00:04:50.849 --> 00:04:53.600 
we're happy to get the points it cuz it
keeps<00:04:51.000> us<00:04:51.120> in<00:04:51.210> the<00:04:51.240> hunt<00:04:51.449> for<00:04:51.539> a<00:04:52.610> better

00:04:53.600 --> 00:04:53.610 
keeps us in the hunt for a better

00:04:53.610 --> 00:04:55.939 
keeps us in the hunt for a better
playoff<00:04:53.970> spot<00:04:54.210> I<00:04:54.449> think<00:04:54.990> the<00:04:55.320> big<00:04:55.500> thing<00:04:55.740> is

00:04:55.939 --> 00:04:55.949 
playoff spot I think the big thing is

00:04:55.949 --> 00:04:58.580 
playoff spot I think the big thing is
that<00:04:56.160> as<00:04:56.699> the<00:04:56.940> sign<00:04:57.150> says<00:04:57.180> over<00:04:57.750> there<00:04:57.960> we

00:04:58.580 --> 00:04:58.590 
that as the sign says over there we

00:04:58.590 --> 00:05:02.540 
that as the sign says over there we
don't<00:04:58.770> surrender<00:04:58.979> we<00:04:59.910> won't<00:05:00.090> give<00:05:00.270> up<00:05:01.550> we're

00:05:02.540 --> 00:05:02.550 
don't surrender we won't give up we're

00:05:02.550 --> 00:05:04.400 
don't surrender we won't give up we're
working<00:05:02.820> on<00:05:02.970> some<00:05:03.210> things<00:05:03.449> at<00:05:03.720> school<00:05:04.080> to

00:05:04.400 --> 00:05:04.410 
working on some things at school to

00:05:04.410 --> 00:05:06.650 
working on some things at school to
maybe<00:05:04.590> try<00:05:04.830> to<00:05:04.919> keep<00:05:05.190> this<00:05:05.340> place<00:05:05.550> open<00:05:05.760> in<00:05:06.389> a

00:05:06.650 --> 00:05:06.660 
maybe try to keep this place open in a

00:05:06.660 --> 00:05:07.730 
maybe try to keep this place open in a
different<00:05:06.990> vein

00:05:07.730 --> 00:05:07.740 
different vein

00:05:07.740 --> 00:05:10.510 
different vein
and<00:05:08.430> I've<00:05:08.729> explained<00:05:09.120> that<00:05:09.240> to<00:05:09.419> the<00:05:09.510> boys<00:05:09.720> and

you know that will come with time we

00:05:13.080 --> 00:05:14.839 
you know that will come with time we
can't<00:05:13.289> rush<00:05:13.470> that<00:05:13.650> whether<00:05:14.220> it<00:05:14.340> goes<00:05:14.460> good<00:05:14.699> or

00:05:14.839 --> 00:05:14.849 
can't rush that whether it goes good or

00:05:14.849 --> 00:05:16.159 
can't rush that whether it goes good or
bad<00:05:15.000> we'll<00:05:15.240> be<00:05:15.330> honest<00:05:15.599> with<00:05:15.750> them<00:05:15.900> one<00:05:16.020> way<00:05:16.139> or
