 hello youtube friends today I bring you a 

00:00:02.379 --> 00:00:06.490
 new video on this occasion will be a 

00:00:04.360 --> 00:00:08.679
 video on how to speed up your games in 

00:00:06.490 --> 00:00:10.059
 Android good first thing you have to 

00:00:08.679 --> 00:00:12.339
 to do is go to the link of the description 

00:00:10.059 --> 00:00:15.249
 of the video download a winrar file 

00:00:12.339 --> 00:00:18.279
 which is called l tool once downloaded 

00:00:15.249 --> 00:00:21.020
 this file we have to extract the 

00:00:18.279 --> 00:00:24.290
 extract to two files 

00:00:21.020 --> 00:00:27.770
 inside a folder that is called that l 

00:00:24.290 --> 00:00:31.369
 tools the two files it contains is 

00:00:27.770 --> 00:00:32.870
 the apec to the plugins that are the data 

00:00:31.369 --> 00:00:35.360
 of the application 

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:38.830
 well let's go with the video 

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:42.800
 once you have downloaded these two 

00:00:38.830 --> 00:00:46.930
 already extracted files we have them 

00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:49.600
 move to the phone card 

00:00:46.930 --> 00:00:52.560
 in my case I just sent the 

00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:52.560
 SD card 

00:00:55.090 --> 00:01:02.260
 data and here is the gel tools 

00:00:59.420 --> 00:01:02.260
 we install 

00:01:02.800 --> 00:01:08.510
 and we will give you the ready 

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:11.030
 then the plugins 

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:14.030
 we do not look where we have sworn our 

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:15.900
 is our folder plugins do not see here 

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:18.870
 I got it 

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:22.680
 we have to send it to memory 

00:01:18.870 --> 00:01:25.200
 internal phone we are going to cut 

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:29.870
 we go to the internal memory of 

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:32.420
 phone and here we paste it 

00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:37.420
 and once this is done we have to 

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:37.420
 go out and enter the gl pulse 

00:01:39.400 --> 00:01:43.780
 As you can see this appears but you do not 

00:01:41.730 --> 00:01:47.110
 it will disappear because I lived I have it 

00:01:43.780 --> 00:01:49.420
 installed a window will appear that 

00:01:47.110 --> 00:01:51.850
 It has three boxes and you have it 

00:01:49.420 --> 00:01:55.360
 to select have to mark the 

00:01:51.850 --> 00:01:59.350
 three already give him install they are 

00:01:55.360 --> 00:02:01.420
 will restart the phone and already once 

00:01:59.350 --> 00:02:04.180
 they are already restarted 

00:02:01.420 --> 00:02:07.720
 you can enter the health tools and already 

00:02:04.180 --> 00:02:10.690
 will have like that I have to clarify that you have to 

00:02:07.720 --> 00:02:13.180
 be a root user if you do not know how to do 

00:02:10.690 --> 00:02:15.310
 check me to another video that I leave in the 

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:18.450
 link of the video description for 

00:02:15.310 --> 00:02:23.640
 what you see how to do is root user 

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:23.640
 good in my case I'm going to 

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:30.730
 and optimize the balance myself 

00:02:27.610 --> 00:02:34.780
 and we click on the configuration that we're going 

00:02:30.730 --> 00:02:36.850
 to use is going to be the next one we are going to 

00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:40.660
 check this box that I did in now of 

00:02:36.850 --> 00:02:43.530
 custom settings for I do not know what it says and 

00:02:40.660 --> 00:02:45.440
 we give in we do not select 

00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:47.540
 and later 

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:52.460
 the next thing we have to do is 

00:02:47.540 --> 00:02:54.940
 say that you search selected say use 

00:02:52.460 --> 00:02:58.150
 and a fake gpu 

00:02:54.940 --> 00:03:01.240
 we put them we select them from here in 

00:02:58.150 --> 00:03:03.790
 that template we have to select a 

00:03:01.240 --> 00:03:06.060
 of these does not have to be with the one that 

00:03:03.790 --> 00:03:09.220
 has appeared from its processor 

00:03:06.060 --> 00:03:13.470
 in my case I have a qualcomm 

00:03:09.220 --> 00:03:13.470
 and I will give you hay 

00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:21.720
 and here it says to be 

00:03:18.510 --> 00:03:24.260
 our textures have already been optimized 

00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:26.819
 of the game 

00:03:24.260 --> 00:03:30.439
 we left 

00:03:26.819 --> 00:03:30.439
 and we enter our game 

00:03:33.100 --> 00:03:38.790
 and we can already test if it is and if it really 

00:03:35.890 --> 00:03:38.790
 it serves or not 

00:03:47.270 --> 00:03:54.830
 to see how the game goes 

00:03:50.120 --> 00:03:58.600
 as you can see, it has improved before 

00:03:54.830 --> 00:04:01.350
 not a little the guide of this and now not 

00:03:58.600 --> 00:04:01.350

00:04:01.370 --> 00:04:06.129
 that's all 

00:04:03.700 --> 00:04:08.300
 I hope you liked the video and 

00:04:06.129 --> 00:04:10.520
 that has served them 

00:04:08.300 --> 00:04:13.640
