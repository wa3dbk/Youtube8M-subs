you're just set and ready to rock which

00:06:10.020 --> 00:06:11.510 
you're just set and ready to rock which
is<00:06:10.050> nice<00:06:10.260> to<00:06:10.409> be<00:06:10.440> able<00:06:10.529> to<00:06:10.620> try<00:06:10.800> any<00:06:11.070> carrier

00:06:11.510 --> 00:06:11.520

00:06:16.100 --> 00:06:16.110 
so one caveat that I do want to mention

00:06:16.110 --> 00:06:17.450 
so one caveat that I do want to mention
you<00:06:16.229> might<00:06:16.380> throw<00:06:16.589> a<00:06:16.620> bit<00:06:16.830> of<00:06:16.949> a<00:06:17.010> wrench<00:06:17.279> in

00:06:17.450 --> 00:06:17.460 
you might throw a bit of a wrench in

00:06:17.460 --> 00:06:20.060

this is most Verizon phones are indeed

00:06:20.070 --> 00:06:22.070 
this is most Verizon phones are indeed
sold<00:06:20.370> GSM<00:06:20.909> unlock<00:06:21.270> so<00:06:21.449> if<00:06:21.539> you<00:06:21.599> pick<00:06:21.779> up<00:06:21.900> a

00:06:22.070 --> 00:06:22.080

sold GSM unlock so if you pick up a
Verizon<00:06:22.560> phone<00:06:22.740> that<00:06:23.010> maybe<00:06:23.159> you<00:06:23.279> got<00:06:23.430> on

Verizon phone that maybe you got on

00:06:23.610 --> 00:06:25.310

it<00:06:25.409> on<00:06:25.500> contract<00:06:25.979> you<00:06:26.550> should<00:06:26.729> still<00:06:26.909> be<00:06:27.000> able

00:06:27.110 --> 00:06:27.120
