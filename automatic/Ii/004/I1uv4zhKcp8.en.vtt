this year our F 9.9 very popular engine

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:29.780 
this year our F 9.9 very popular engine
in<00:02:27.510> our<00:02:27.660> lineup<00:02:27.900> I've<00:02:28.440> seen<00:02:28.770> some<00:02:29.129> some

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:29.790 
in our lineup I've seen some some

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:31.880 
in our lineup I've seen some some
improvement<00:02:30.360> but<00:02:31.050> let<00:02:31.230> me<00:02:31.349> step<00:02:31.650> back<00:02:31.830> a

00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:31.890 
improvement but let me step back a

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:34.070 
improvement but let me step back a
little<00:02:32.040> bit<00:02:32.370> first<00:02:32.670> this<00:02:33.569> engine<00:02:33.810> was

00:02:34.070 --> 00:02:34.080 
little bit first this engine was

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:37.369 
little bit first this engine was
completely<00:02:34.709> redesigned<00:02:35.280> in<00:02:35.430> 2008<00:02:36.239> at<00:02:37.170> that

00:02:37.369 --> 00:02:37.379 
completely redesigned in 2008 at that

00:02:37.379 --> 00:02:40.430 
completely redesigned in 2008 at that
time<00:02:37.650> our<00:02:38.340> goal<00:02:38.730> was<00:02:39.300> to<00:02:39.480> bring<00:02:39.660> a<00:02:39.810> four-stroke

00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:40.440 
time our goal was to bring a four-stroke

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:43.270 
time our goal was to bring a four-stroke
in<00:02:40.980> the<00:02:41.129> 9.9<00:02:41.730> category<00:02:42.300> that<00:02:42.510> would<00:02:42.720> be

00:02:43.270 --> 00:02:43.280 
in the 9.9 category that would be

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:46.130 
in the 9.9 category that would be
replacing<00:02:44.280> the<00:02:45.209> two-stroke<00:02:45.690> that<00:02:45.840> are<00:02:45.959> being

00:02:46.130 --> 00:02:46.140 
replacing the two-stroke that are being

00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:48.920 
replacing the two-stroke that are being
discontinued<00:02:46.830> because<00:02:46.980> of<00:02:47.310> omission<00:02:47.760> so<00:02:48.030> our

00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:48.930 
discontinued because of omission so our

00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:50.770 
discontinued because of omission so our
targets<00:02:49.379> were<00:02:49.560> to<00:02:49.709> bring<00:02:49.860> it<00:02:50.010> at<00:02:50.280> that<00:02:50.459> engine

00:02:50.770 --> 00:02:50.780 
targets were to bring it at that engine

00:02:50.780 --> 00:02:53.900 
targets were to bring it at that engine
in<00:02:51.780> the<00:02:52.319> same<00:02:52.530> performance<00:02:52.890> as<00:02:53.280> a<00:02:53.340> two-stroke

00:02:53.900 --> 00:02:53.910 
in the same performance as a two-stroke

00:02:53.910 --> 00:02:56.930 
in the same performance as a two-stroke
as<00:02:54.090> well<00:02:54.599> as<00:02:54.780> size<00:02:55.050> compactness<00:02:55.920> and<00:02:56.280> weight

00:02:56.930 --> 00:02:56.940 
as well as size compactness and weight

00:02:56.940 --> 00:02:59.780 
as well as size compactness and weight
so<00:02:57.360> we<00:02:57.810> did<00:02:57.989> succeed<00:02:58.379> with<00:02:58.620> that<00:02:58.800> a<00:02:59.190> few<00:02:59.670> years

00:02:59.780 --> 00:02:59.790 
so we did succeed with that a few years

00:02:59.790 --> 00:03:01.699 
so we did succeed with that a few years
back<00:03:00.060> and<00:03:00.330> now<00:03:00.450> we're<00:03:00.989> back<00:03:01.140> with<00:03:01.500> some

00:03:01.699 --> 00:03:01.709 
back and now we're back with some

00:03:01.709 --> 00:03:04.040 
back and now we're back with some
additional<00:03:01.950> changes<00:03:02.430> to<00:03:03.150> improve<00:03:03.239> the

00:03:04.040 --> 00:03:04.050 
additional changes to improve the

00:03:04.050 --> 00:03:06.890 
additional changes to improve the
ergonomic<00:03:04.709> of<00:03:04.830> the<00:03:04.950> engine<00:03:05.480> the<00:03:06.480> portability

position which is nuh pass has been
maybe<00:04:19.470> a<00:04:19.620> bit<00:04:20.430> of<00:04:20.459> an<00:04:20.609> issue<00:04:20.729> on<00:04:20.910> four<00:04:21.269> stroke

00:04:21.560 --> 00:04:21.570 
maybe a bit of an issue on four stroke

00:04:21.570 --> 00:04:23.150 
maybe a bit of an issue on four stroke
because<00:04:21.690> of<00:04:21.959> the<00:04:22.079> oil<00:04:22.109> inside<00:04:22.620> but<00:04:22.860> what<00:04:23.009> we've

00:04:23.150 --> 00:04:23.160 
because of the oil inside but what we've

00:04:23.160 --> 00:04:25.129 
because of the oil inside but what we've
done<00:04:23.340> is<00:04:23.550> we've<00:04:23.729> had<00:04:23.940> it<00:04:24.120> some<00:04:24.300> resting<00:04:24.750> pad<00:04:24.930> at

00:04:25.129 --> 00:04:25.139 
done is we've had it some resting pad at

00:04:25.139 --> 00:04:25.490 
done is we've had it some resting pad at
the

00:04:25.490 --> 00:04:25.500 
the

00:04:25.500 --> 00:04:27.710 
the
of<00:04:25.650> the<00:04:26.160> engine<00:04:26.610> here<00:04:27.000> if<00:04:27.120> you<00:04:27.240> see<00:04:27.270> the<00:04:27.600> back

00:04:27.710 --> 00:04:27.720 
of the engine here if you see the back

00:04:27.720 --> 00:04:30.710 
of the engine here if you see the back
cowling<00:04:28.440> and<00:04:28.530> this<00:04:29.130> allows<00:04:29.460> us<00:04:29.490> to<00:04:29.730> rest<00:04:30.180> the

00:04:30.710 --> 00:04:30.720 
cowling and this allows us to rest the

00:04:30.720 --> 00:04:32.920 
cowling and this allows us to rest the
engine<00:04:31.080> on<00:04:31.200> its<00:04:31.350> back<00:04:31.590> in<00:04:31.830> a<00:04:31.920> more<00:04:32.160> compact

00:04:32.920 --> 00:04:32.930 
engine on its back in a more compact

00:04:32.930 --> 00:04:35.390 
engine on its back in a more compact
position<00:04:33.930> then<00:04:34.350> you<00:04:34.680> would<00:04:34.830> typically<00:04:35.160> have

00:04:35.390 --> 00:04:35.400 
position then you would typically have

00:04:35.400 --> 00:04:37.450 
position then you would typically have
to<00:04:35.550> do<00:04:35.670> on<00:04:35.850> the<00:04:36.000> tiller<00:04:36.300> handle<00:04:36.390> site<00:04:36.900> so<00:04:37.140> very

00:04:37.450 --> 00:04:37.460 
to do on the tiller handle site so very

00:04:37.460 --> 00:04:39.920 
to do on the tiller handle site so very
convenient<00:04:38.460> feature<00:04:38.670> and<00:04:39.000> then<00:04:39.450> to<00:04:39.630> round<00:04:39.810> it

00:04:39.920 --> 00:04:39.930 
convenient feature and then to round it

00:04:39.930 --> 00:04:42.890 
convenient feature and then to round it
up<00:04:40.100> just<00:04:41.100> to<00:04:41.310> give<00:04:41.790> it<00:04:41.820> a<00:04:42.000> new<00:04:42.180> and<00:04:42.420> fresh<00:04:42.630> look

00:04:42.890 --> 00:04:42.900 
up just to give it a new and fresh look

00:04:42.900 --> 00:04:44.720 
up just to give it a new and fresh look
we've<00:04:43.110> changed<00:04:43.410> the<00:04:43.590> top<00:04:43.860> and<00:04:44.040> bottom<00:04:44.190> cowling

00:04:44.720 --> 00:04:44.730 
we've changed the top and bottom cowling

00:04:44.730 --> 00:04:47.390 
we've changed the top and bottom cowling
which<00:04:45.320> brings<00:04:46.320> it<00:04:46.470> in<00:04:46.590> line<00:04:46.620> with<00:04:47.010> the<00:04:47.100> rest<00:04:47.130> of

00:04:47.390 --> 00:04:47.400 
which brings it in line with the rest of

00:04:47.400 --> 00:04:49.760 
which brings it in line with the rest of
our<00:04:47.490> lineup<00:04:47.820> so<00:04:48.180> it<00:04:48.360> all<00:04:48.510> look<00:04:48.780> well<00:04:49.320> in<00:04:49.500> Arma

00:04:49.760 --> 00:04:49.770 
our lineup so it all look well in Arma

00:04:49.770 --> 00:04:52.070 
our lineup so it all look well in Arma
nice<00:04:49.920> these<00:04:50.640> changes<00:04:50.910> in<00:04:51.270> the<00:04:51.330> cosmetic<00:04:51.900> side

00:04:52.070 --> 00:04:52.080 
nice these changes in the cosmetic side

00:04:52.080 --> 00:04:54.530 
nice these changes in the cosmetic side
is<00:04:52.230> also<00:04:52.590> applicable<00:04:53.250> to<00:04:53.760> the<00:04:53.940> t<00:04:54.120> nine<00:04:54.270> point

00:04:54.530 --> 00:04:54.540 
is also applicable to the t nine point

00:04:54.540 --> 00:04:56.300 
is also applicable to the t nine point
nine<00:04:54.600> which<00:04:54.900> is<00:04:55.080> a<00:04:55.110> very<00:04:55.470> popular<00:04:55.770> kicker

00:04:56.300 --> 00:04:56.310 
nine which is a very popular kicker

00:04:56.310 --> 00:04:58.520 
nine which is a very popular kicker
engine<00:04:56.700> so<00:04:57.090> you<00:04:57.150> can<00:04:57.390> imagine<00:04:57.510> if<00:04:58.050> you<00:04:58.169> install

00:04:58.520 --> 00:04:58.530 
engine so you can imagine if you install

00:04:58.530 --> 00:05:00.530 
engine so you can imagine if you install
that<00:04:58.560> with<00:04:58.890> a<00:04:58.919> brand<00:04:59.160> new<00:04:59.250> v6<00:04:59.760> then<00:05:00.270> you<00:05:00.360> have

00:05:00.530 --> 00:05:00.540 
that with a brand new v6 then you have

00:05:00.540 --> 00:05:03.500 
that with a brand new v6 then you have
the<00:05:00.660> same<00:05:00.900> look<00:05:01.610> because<00:05:02.610> of<00:05:02.790> those<00:05:03.030> recent

00:05:03.500 --> 00:05:03.510 
the same look because of those recent

00:05:03.510 --> 00:05:06.530 
the same look because of those recent
changes<00:05:03.870> so<00:05:04.490> so<00:05:05.490> from<00:05:05.760> this<00:05:05.880> angle<00:05:06.120> you<00:05:06.390> can

00:05:06.530 --> 00:05:06.540 
changes so so from this angle you can

00:05:06.540 --> 00:05:08.260 
changes so so from this angle you can
see<00:05:06.750> what<00:05:07.169> we<00:05:07.260> brought<00:05:07.470> in<00:05:07.650> in<00:05:07.770> here<00:05:08.070> is<00:05:08.220> a

00:05:08.260 --> 00:05:08.270 
see what we brought in in here is a

00:05:08.270 --> 00:05:10.670 
see what we brought in in here is a
two-stroke<00:05:09.270> we<00:05:09.600> brought<00:05:09.870> it<00:05:10.020> here<00:05:10.230> so<00:05:10.440> we<00:05:10.560> can

00:05:10.670 --> 00:05:10.680 
two-stroke we brought it here so we can

00:05:10.680 --> 00:05:12.500 
two-stroke we brought it here so we can
put<00:05:10.860> them<00:05:11.010> side-by-side<00:05:11.280> so<00:05:11.850> consumer<00:05:12.330> can

00:05:12.500 --> 00:05:12.510 
put them side-by-side so consumer can

00:05:12.510 --> 00:05:15.020 
put them side-by-side so consumer can
can<00:05:13.020> realize<00:05:13.500> I'll<00:05:13.860> compact<00:05:14.370> that<00:05:14.520> engine<00:05:14.910> you

00:05:15.020 --> 00:05:15.030 
can realize I'll compact that engine you

00:05:15.030 --> 00:05:16.970 
can realize I'll compact that engine you
can<00:05:15.060> see<00:05:15.360> that<00:05:15.540> even<00:05:15.750> the<00:05:15.990> head<00:05:16.169> of<00:05:16.650> the<00:05:16.740> force

00:05:16.970 --> 00:05:16.980 
can see that even the head of the force

00:05:16.980 --> 00:05:19.909 
can see that even the head of the force
torque<00:05:17.220> is<00:05:17.340> a<00:05:17.400> little<00:05:17.669> bit<00:05:17.790> smaller<00:05:18.320> and<00:05:19.320> very

00:05:19.909 --> 00:05:19.919 
torque is a little bit smaller and very

00:05:19.919 --> 00:05:22.580 
torque is a little bit smaller and very
very<00:05:20.100> compact
