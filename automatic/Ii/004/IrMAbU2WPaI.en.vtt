I've<00:02:30.810> got<00:02:31.020> all<00:02:31.110> the<00:02:31.140> knobby<00:02:31.470> set<00:02:31.830> at<00:02:31.920> noon

00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:32.100 
I've got all the knobby set at noon

00:02:32.100 --> 00:02:34.160 
I've got all the knobby set at noon
here's<00:02:32.460> my<00:02:32.670> clean<00:02:32.970> sound<00:02:33.270> with<00:02:33.480> the<00:02:33.660> carbon

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:34.170 
here's my clean sound with the carbon

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:37.430 
here's my clean sound with the carbon
copy<00:02:34.380> switched<00:02:34.890> off

00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:37.440 

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:48.410 

ah<00:02:38.570> okay<00:02:39.570> now<00:02:39.750> let's<00:02:39.990> turn<00:02:40.860> it<00:02:41.070> on

00:02:48.410 --> 00:02:48.420 

00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:51.180 

and<00:02:49.420> as<00:02:49.510> you<00:02:49.630> can<00:02:49.810> hear<00:02:50.020> it<00:02:50.140> almost<00:02:50.470> starts<00:02:51.070> to

00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:51.190 
and as you can hear it almost starts to

00:02:51.190 --> 00:02:53.160 
and as you can hear it almost starts to
self<00:02:51.460> oscillate<00:02:52.030> even<00:02:52.390> with<00:02:52.540> the<00:02:52.660> knobs<00:02:52.900> at

00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:53.170 
self oscillate even with the knobs at

00:02:53.170 --> 00:02:54.960 
self oscillate even with the knobs at
noon<00:02:53.380> so<00:02:53.920> I'm<00:02:53.980> just<00:02:54.130> going<00:02:54.280> to<00:02:54.340> take<00:02:54.580> back<00:02:54.790> the

00:02:54.960 --> 00:02:54.970 
noon so I'm just going to take back the

00:02:54.970 --> 00:02:57.390 
noon so I'm just going to take back the
regen<00:02:55.450> or<00:02:55.600> the<00:02:55.720> feedback<00:02:55.960> knob<00:02:56.410> and<00:02:56.680> put<00:02:57.250> the

00:02:57.390 --> 00:02:57.400 
regen or the feedback knob and put the

00:02:57.400 --> 00:03:00.450 
regen or the feedback knob and put the
mix<00:02:57.670> knob<00:02:58.170> also<00:02:59.170> somewhere<00:03:00.070> around<00:03:00.130> ten

00:03:00.450 --> 00:03:00.460 
mix knob also somewhere around ten

00:03:00.460 --> 00:03:08.630 
mix knob also somewhere around ten
o'clock

00:03:08.630 --> 00:03:08.640 

00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:11.250 

so<00:03:09.640> it's<00:03:09.760> one<00:03:09.910> of<00:03:10.030> those<00:03:10.150> delay<00:03:10.660> pedals<00:03:11.110> that

00:03:11.250 --> 00:03:11.260 
so it's one of those delay pedals that

00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:14.580 
so it's one of those delay pedals that
you<00:03:11.530> can<00:03:12.490> barely<00:03:13.000> hear<00:03:13.330> you<00:03:13.540> can<00:03:14.080> barely<00:03:14.260> tell

00:03:14.580 --> 00:03:14.590 
you can barely hear you can barely tell

00:03:14.590 --> 00:03:16.860 
you can barely hear you can barely tell
that<00:03:14.740> it's<00:03:14.890> there<00:03:15.010> but<00:03:15.340> when<00:03:15.520> it's<00:03:15.670> off<00:03:15.910> you'll

00:03:16.860 --> 00:03:16.870 
that it's there but when it's off you'll

00:03:16.870 --> 00:03:22.410 
that it's there but when it's off you'll
hear<00:03:17.080> it<00:03:17.230> all<00:03:17.320> the<00:03:17.380> ambience<00:03:17.950> is<00:03:18.100> gone<00:03:20.580> see<00:03:21.580> now

00:03:22.410 --> 00:03:22.420 
hear it all the ambience is gone see now

00:03:22.420 --> 00:03:32.850 
hear it all the ambience is gone see now
let's<00:03:22.660> turn<00:03:22.900> up<00:03:22.960> the<00:03:23.140> mix<00:03:31.320> okay<00:03:32.320> let's<00:03:32.530> take<00:03:32.709> it

00:03:32.850 --> 00:03:32.860 
let's turn up the mix okay let's take it

00:03:32.860 --> 00:03:35.100 
let's turn up the mix okay let's take it
back<00:03:33.040> and<00:03:33.370> let's<00:03:33.640> go<00:03:33.820> for<00:03:34.090> a<00:03:34.120> longer<00:03:34.930> delay

00:03:35.100 --> 00:03:35.110 
back and let's go for a longer delay

00:03:35.110 --> 00:04:17.819 
back and let's go for a longer delay
time

00:04:17.819 --> 00:04:17.829 

00:04:17.829 --> 00:04:26.740 

Oh

00:04:26.740 --> 00:04:26.750 

00:04:26.750 --> 00:04:29.600 

okay<00:04:27.750> a<00:04:27.780> real<00:04:28.200> analog<00:04:28.740> delay<00:04:29.070> does<00:04:29.370> that

00:04:29.600 --> 00:04:29.610 
okay a real analog delay does that

00:04:29.610 --> 00:04:32.120 
okay a real analog delay does that
itself<00:04:30.060> oscillates<00:04:30.720> when<00:04:30.960> the<00:04:31.140> region<00:04:31.650> would

00:04:32.120 --> 00:04:32.130 
itself oscillates when the region would

00:04:32.130 --> 00:04:33.860 
itself oscillates when the region would
a<00:04:32.190> feedback<00:04:32.670> knob<00:04:32.910> is<00:04:33.120> up<00:04:33.270> high<00:04:33.450> and<00:04:33.630> then<00:04:33.720> when

00:04:33.860 --> 00:04:33.870 
a feedback knob is up high and then when

00:04:33.870 --> 00:04:35.630 
a feedback knob is up high and then when
you<00:04:33.990> twist<00:04:34.320> the<00:04:34.560> delay<00:04:34.980> knob<00:04:35.190> you<00:04:35.370> get<00:04:35.490> all

00:04:35.630 --> 00:04:35.640 
you twist the delay knob you get all

00:04:35.640 --> 00:05:59.690 
you twist the delay knob you get all
sorts<00:04:35.970> of<00:04:36.090> funky<00:04:36.480> effects

00:05:59.690 --> 00:05:59.700 

00:05:59.700 --> 00:06:04.100 

you

00:06:04.100 --> 00:06:04.110 

00:06:04.110 --> 00:06:08.170 

you

00:06:08.170 --> 00:06:08.180 

00:06:08.180 --> 00:06:12.400 

you

00:06:12.400 --> 00:06:12.410 

00:06:12.410 --> 00:06:15.160 

in<00:06:12.500> my<00:06:13.010> humble<00:06:13.220> opinion<00:06:13.580> the<00:06:13.940> mxr<00:06:14.540> carbon-copy

00:06:15.160 --> 00:06:15.170 
in my humble opinion the mxr carbon-copy

00:06:15.170 --> 00:06:16.510 
in my humble opinion the mxr carbon-copy
sounds<00:06:15.650> mighty<00:06:16.010> good

00:06:16.510 --> 00:06:16.520 
sounds mighty good

00:06:16.520 --> 00:06:19.270 
sounds mighty good
it<00:06:16.580> has<00:06:17.000> a<00:06:17.030> great<00:06:17.450> slap<00:06:17.900> back<00:06:18.170> tone<00:06:18.470> and<00:06:18.710> a

00:06:19.270 --> 00:06:19.280 
it has a great slap back tone and a

00:06:19.280 --> 00:06:21.370 
it has a great slap back tone and a
maximum<00:06:19.730> delay<00:06:19.970> time<00:06:20.240> of<00:06:20.420> 600<00:06:20.900> milliseconds

00:06:21.370 --> 00:06:21.380 
maximum delay time of 600 milliseconds

00:06:21.380 --> 00:06:23.230 
maximum delay time of 600 milliseconds
is<00:06:21.500> pretty<00:06:21.770> long<00:06:22.040> for<00:06:22.310> an<00:06:22.400> all<00:06:22.490> analog<00:06:22.820> delay

00:06:23.230 --> 00:06:23.240 
is pretty long for an all analog delay

00:06:23.240 --> 00:06:25.030 
is pretty long for an all analog delay
so<00:06:23.300> it's<00:06:23.600> perfect<00:06:24.020> for<00:06:24.050> lead<00:06:24.320> guitar<00:06:24.680> as<00:06:24.830> well

00:06:25.030 --> 00:06:25.040 
so it's perfect for lead guitar as well

00:06:25.040 --> 00:06:27.160 
so it's perfect for lead guitar as well
if<00:06:25.700> you're<00:06:25.910> looking<00:06:26.000> for<00:06:26.270> more<00:06:26.450> tweak<00:06:26.720> ability

if you're looking for more tweak ability

00:06:27.170 --> 00:06:28.780 
if you're looking for more tweak ability
for<00:06:27.350> the<00:06:27.440> modulation<00:06:27.920> for<00:06:28.280> example<00:06:28.700> you

for the modulation for example you

for the modulation for example you
