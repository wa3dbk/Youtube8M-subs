00:00:12.730 --> 00:00:19.160
 so here I start I'm in him 

00:00:15.889 --> 00:00:21.950
 here I am little tired and then I'm going 

00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:23.810
 as on instagram check messages 

00:00:21.950 --> 00:00:26.960
 that I receive with the news of a 

00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:29.419
 other person that I am then I 

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:32.470
 go on facebook to watch a little 

00:00:29.419 --> 00:00:32.470
 little but how to shut up and so on 

00:00:33.940 --> 00:00:39.579
 I go directly to the shower and 

00:00:36.969 --> 00:00:41.980
 I am currently using the caramel dupe 

00:00:39.579 --> 00:00:44.829
 who is super frankly and paul face 

00:00:41.980 --> 00:00:46.089
 a super mild cleanser next 

00:00:44.829 --> 00:00:47.649
 I'm going to eat it's true 

00:00:46.089 --> 00:00:49.960
 it's rare that I eat but I wanted 

00:00:47.649 --> 00:00:53.620
 do it for this video so has the 

00:00:49.960 --> 00:00:55.479
 coffee I did not want you either 

00:00:53.620 --> 00:00:56.799
 to show things too well because 

00:00:55.479 --> 00:00:59.170
 that here I think that junk 

00:00:56.799 --> 00:01:00.610
 and that you direction the dressing 

00:00:59.170 --> 00:01:02.949
 I will see a little bit of what I have 

00:01:00.610 --> 00:01:05.979
 what am I going to wear for for the 

00:01:02.949 --> 00:01:08.860
 day always down pants but 

00:01:05.979 --> 00:01:11.979
 here I wanted to resume 

00:01:08.860 --> 00:01:14.890
 clothes for for the video I'm going 

00:01:11.979 --> 00:01:17.020
 do it right after that so a hall of the coup 

00:01:14.890 --> 00:01:19.580
 I dream all the clothes that 

00:01:17.020 --> 00:01:22.040
 interests me and I 

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:24.950
 I'm going out as clearly as I 

00:01:22.040 --> 00:01:29.060
 makeup with an orange base and so 

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:30.080
 to gnaw at the fore project is an anti 

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:33.260
 dark circles at edf's 

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:36.040
 I blame all that we see as the 

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:36.040
 difference I mean 

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:46.759
 clinical foundation and elf I 

00:01:43.969 --> 00:01:48.920
 promotes the use of rossion but 

00:01:46.759 --> 00:01:53.270
 my foundation and I blend blaine 

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:56.030
 all this with the brush here is the result 

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:57.439
 so I did not want you all but there 

00:01:56.030 --> 00:01:59.799
 I choose my clothes that I'm going 

00:01:57.439 --> 00:02:02.810
 wear for video 

00:01:59.799 --> 00:02:06.859
 so then saw that I pulled out all 

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:09.019
 clothes there is one of those chances on 

00:02:06.859 --> 00:02:11.599
 my bed so here it was for the top 

00:02:09.019 --> 00:02:14.030
 then for global wanted to do a 

00:02:11.599 --> 00:02:17.019
 super simple stuff i'm not going to take me 

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:20.329
 the head I make small green folds 

00:02:17.019 --> 00:02:23.390
 to the sale to put volume on 

00:02:20.329 --> 00:02:26.120
 my viable and that's a super simple trick 

00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:27.680
 done in 3 2 seconds and that's the moment 

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:30.920
 where I turn the video 

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:33.349
 so I particularly like doing that 

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:34.849
 when I'm on break anyway 

00:02:33.349 --> 00:02:37.280
 when I have nothing to do 

00:02:34.849 --> 00:02:40.299
 and here it is a pleasure frankly 

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:40.299
 turn on rates 

00:02:40.950 --> 00:02:46.620
 I really came from the china bowl when I 

00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:47.819
 am at home during the guen va 

00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:49.620
 when I'm on vacation is expected to 

00:02:47.819 --> 00:02:51.720
 13h holidays and suddenly I wanted you 

00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:53.879
 you just do it is more my 

00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:57.230
 routine and well I hope it's okay 

00:02:53.879 --> 00:02:57.230
 please my next
