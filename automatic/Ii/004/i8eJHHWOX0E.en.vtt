00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:28.680

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:32.039
 blood drinks like a comp by 

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:36.420
 but filled in on half that is 

00:01:32.039 --> 00:01:40.380
 it's very unpleasant and let's go for it 

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:42.869
 something in the mine can resources than yes yes 

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:47.630
 weâ€™ll just not have to lose the house 

00:01:42.869 --> 00:01:47.630
 remember coordinates by the way coordinates 

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:58.789
 now I have younger and will write 

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:58.789
 coordinates and we go down there down 

00:01:58.849 --> 00:02:04.909
 now he will write wait a little bit 

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:15.989
 he wrote everything down and we'll probably go to 

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:18.120
 mine we go right under the house at all 

00:02:15.989 --> 00:02:21.000
 I don't give a shit, I have half a pickaxe 

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:22.319
 I have a damn diamond 

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:24.390
 I should not have taken it at all 

00:02:22.319 --> 00:02:27.440
 let's prepare you 

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:27.440
 let's go 

00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:38.790
 in that 

00:02:33.430 --> 00:02:38.790
 just have a light was a pancake 

00:02:40.830 --> 00:02:44.540
 cretin rise get the fuck up knows 

00:02:53.090 --> 00:02:57.860
 I never understood or not but encourage 

00:02:58.090 --> 00:03:06.690
 so so so that the buff was less 

00:03:12.390 --> 00:03:19.220
 need to go upstairs behind the tree again 

00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:19.220
 sambo 

00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:31.830
 need to climb behind a tree to 

00:03:28.770 --> 00:03:33.810
 craft work bench and picks as we 

00:03:31.830 --> 00:03:36.270
 miners we need picks 

00:03:33.810 --> 00:03:40.200
 or sets of lobbies, and I do not have 

00:03:36.270 --> 00:03:42.840
 so I will dig with picks from me yet 

00:03:40.200 --> 00:03:45.420
 There is a chance of falling out of any kind of rut that is 

00:03:42.840 --> 00:03:49.350
 if diamond ore falls there it is not 

00:03:45.420 --> 00:03:53.810

00:03:49.350 --> 00:03:59.430

00:03:53.810 --> 00:04:01.920

00:04:17.380 --> 00:04:24.230
 maybe we will move later 

00:04:20.300 --> 00:04:26.800

00:04:24.230 --> 00:04:26.800
