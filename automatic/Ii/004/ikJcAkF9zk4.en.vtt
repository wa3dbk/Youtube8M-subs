00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:36.690 
know I wouldn't use it for a protein

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:39.740 
know I wouldn't use it for a protein
source<00:00:37.190> it's<00:00:38.190> a<00:00:38.340> high<00:00:38.700> in<00:00:38.850> vitamin<00:00:39.300> A<00:00:39.570> and

tofu<00:00:55.020> now<00:00:55.500> you've<00:00:55.680> probably<00:00:55.890> seen<00:00:56.480> my<00:00:57.480> video

00:00:58.160 --> 00:00:58.170 
tofu now you've probably seen my video

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:02.599 
tofu now you've probably seen my video
on<00:00:58.399> organic<00:00:59.399> tofu<00:00:59.670> or<00:01:00.149> tofu<00:01:00.780> and<00:01:01.430> you'll<00:01:02.430> know

00:01:02.599 --> 00:01:02.609 
on organic tofu or tofu and you'll know

00:01:02.609 --> 00:01:06.679 
on organic tofu or tofu and you'll know
that<00:01:02.640> it's<00:01:03.300> high<00:01:03.809> in<00:01:03.960> protein<00:01:03.989> and<00:01:05.689> actually

00:01:06.679 --> 00:01:06.689 
that it's high in protein and actually

00:01:06.689 --> 00:01:10.280 
that it's high in protein and actually
has<00:01:06.900> binary<00:01:07.350> streams<00:01:07.830> which<00:01:08.070> bind<00:01:08.909> to<00:01:09.290> the

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:10.290 
has binary streams which bind to the

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:12.980 
has binary streams which bind to the
issues<00:01:10.830> and<00:01:10.979> receptor<00:01:11.400> sites<00:01:11.640> but<00:01:12.450> are<00:01:12.720> less

00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:12.990 
issues and receptor sites but are less

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:15.230 
issues and receptor sites but are less
powerful<00:01:13.290> so<00:01:13.860> you<00:01:14.310> actually<00:01:14.700> end<00:01:15.060> up<00:01:15.180> with

00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:15.240 
powerful so you actually end up with

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:18.469 
powerful so you actually end up with
less<00:01:16.049> estrogen<00:01:16.470> in<00:01:16.890> your<00:01:16.920> system<00:01:17.400> so<00:01:17.610> that

00:01:18.469 --> 00:01:18.479 
less estrogen in your system so that

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:22.460 
less estrogen in your system so that
equals<00:01:19.170> less<00:01:19.500> fat<00:01:19.830> and<00:01:20.130> more<00:01:20.220> muscle<00:01:21.470> you've

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:22.470 
equals less fat and more muscle you've

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:24.530 
equals less fat and more muscle you've
also<00:01:22.619> got<00:01:22.950> no<00:01:23.130> cholesterol<00:01:23.490> as<00:01:24.000> opposed<00:01:24.420> to

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:24.540 
also got no cholesterol as opposed to

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:27.649 
also got no cholesterol as opposed to
meat<00:01:24.840> and<00:01:25.280> they<00:01:26.280> also<00:01:26.460> it's<00:01:26.790> also<00:01:26.939> very<00:01:27.360> high

00:01:27.649 --> 00:01:27.659

in<00:01:27.990> calcium<00:01:28.530> and<00:01:29.009> iron<00:01:29.180> also<00:01:30.180> very<00:01:30.869> good<00:01:31.049> for

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:31.290 
in calcium and iron also very good for

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:33.940 
in calcium and iron also very good for
muscle<00:01:31.439> building<00:01:31.619> and<00:01:31.979> oxygen<00:01:32.520> delivery<00:01:33.000> and
