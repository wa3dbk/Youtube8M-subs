00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:05.169
 from a meter of snow up in some 

00:00:03.070 --> 00:00:07.540
 locations there are over two and a half meters 

00:00:05.169 --> 00:00:10.210
 of fresh snow and still viability in 

00:00:07.540 --> 00:00:12.790
 tilt and difficulty do not finish curtain is 

00:00:10.210 --> 00:00:15.100
 isolated same fate for the high agordino 

00:00:12.790 --> 00:00:17.170
 and the Jordanian plant fault collapsed e 

00:00:15.100 --> 00:00:19.390
 impressive avalanches that fell on 

00:00:17.170 --> 00:00:21.630
 road that climbs to zoldo with a front of 

00:00:19.390 --> 00:00:24.220
 15 meters to five meters in height 

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:26.200
 replicated shortly after by another casting 

00:00:24.220 --> 00:00:28.330
 that affected the same road 

00:00:26.200 --> 00:00:30.580
 pisa genova to say it and I'm just born 

00:00:28.330 --> 00:00:32.289
 spar to take gas for the 

00:00:30.580 --> 00:00:34.719
 home generator because here 

00:00:32.289 --> 00:00:38.309
 current there is no snow there is so much 

00:00:34.719 --> 00:00:40.929
 we have been warned, however, perhaps 

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:42.460
 due I have to go until sixth if there 

00:00:40.929 --> 00:00:44.859
 I can 

00:00:42.460 --> 00:00:46.839
 if I succeed it is real emergency for 

00:00:44.859 --> 00:00:49.239
 the absence of energy that affects many 

00:00:46.839 --> 00:00:51.219
 locality around the northern slope from 

00:00:49.239 --> 00:00:53.499
 falcade a sappada with municipalities 

00:00:51.219 --> 00:00:55.269
 completely in the dark but this time at 

00:00:53.499 --> 00:00:57.399
 remain without electricity there are also i 

00:00:55.269 --> 00:00:59.499
 municipalities of the western ArsiÃ¨ area 

00:00:57.399 --> 00:01:02.350
 lamon over-faced if it is not a bulletin 

00:00:59.499 --> 00:01:04.809
 of war we generally miss it 

00:01:02.350 --> 00:01:07.420
 a little heart in peace and realize 

00:01:04.809 --> 00:01:09.610
 which won't be as short as it was for 

00:01:07.420 --> 00:01:11.500
 us last time ie two days but 

00:01:09.610 --> 00:01:13.360
 we should our people 

00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:13.810
 start organizing for at least 45 

00:01:13.360 --> 00:01:16.390
 days 

00:01:13.810 --> 00:01:18.369
 not even the technicians of terna know how much 

00:01:16.390 --> 00:01:20.469
 the blackout will last you see it too 

00:01:18.369 --> 00:01:23.200
 what is the boundary situation then 

00:01:20.469 --> 00:01:27.880
 obvious what may have been and is 

00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:29.740
 so let's say it 's a particular one 

00:01:27.880 --> 00:01:31.689
 type of snow particularly 

00:01:29.740 --> 00:01:34.450
 heavy which makes it extremely 

00:01:31.689 --> 00:01:36.299
 vulnerable conductors for us as for 

00:01:34.450 --> 00:01:38.350
 all other electrical operators 

00:01:36.299 --> 00:01:40.080
 someone told us that until Monday 

00:01:38.350 --> 00:01:44.240
 there will be no 

00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:47.100
 the solutions to this are not expressed 

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:48.930
 we are working roads closed schools 

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:51.300
 closed the decision was already taken 

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:53.970
 yesterday and affects all the submerged areas 

00:01:51.300 --> 00:01:55.530
 from the snow but you have to look ahead 

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:58.350
 let's hope this winter passes because 

00:01:55.530 --> 00:02:00.390
 it is a nightmare when it ends however 

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:02.130
 it will be necessary to adopt mayors and 

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:04.590
 administrations of those tools that 

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:06.330
 they serve to intervene on these 

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:09.680
 problems next spring 

00:02:06.330 --> 00:02:09.680
 I want to hear chainsaw singing
