know how to do the hand glide freeze
so<00:00:25.279> we<00:00:25.730> minutes<00:00:26.029> toward<00:00:26.330> Iran<00:00:26.450> that<00:00:26.630> a<00:00:26.869> while

I told you that you need the hand glide

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:10.990 
I told you that you need the hand glide
freeze<00:01:09.290> is<00:01:09.590> because<00:01:10.040> for<00:01:10.340> crickets<00:01:10.670> you're

00:01:10.990 --> 00:01:11.000 
freeze is because for crickets you're

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:13.530 
freeze is because for crickets you're
bouncing<00:01:11.600> in<00:01:11.780> the<00:01:11.810> hand<00:01:12.110> gloves<00:01:12.290> freeze<00:01:12.590> so

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:13.540 
bouncing in the hand gloves freeze so

00:01:13.540 --> 00:01:19.000 
bouncing in the hand gloves freeze so
get<00:01:14.540> in<00:01:14.600> the<00:01:14.659> hand<00:01:14.840> glide<00:01:14.990> freeze<00:01:15.260> and<00:01:18.010> you're

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:19.010 
get in the hand glide freeze and you're

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:24.820 
get in the hand glide freeze and you're
gonna<00:01:19.130> push<00:01:19.490> up<00:01:19.810> with<00:01:20.810> your<00:01:21.140> right<00:01:22.000> so<00:01:23.000> but<00:01:23.830> you

00:01:24.820 --> 00:01:24.830 
gonna push up with your right so but you

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:27.060 
gonna push up with your right so but you
like<00:01:24.980> push<00:01:25.280> off<00:01:25.460> the<00:01:25.580> ground<00:01:25.610> you're<00:01:26.480> a<00:01:26.510> bounce

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:27.070 
like push off the ground you're a bounce

00:01:27.070 --> 00:01:31.930 
like push off the ground you're a bounce
so<00:01:28.070> just<00:01:28.310> like<00:01:28.820> that<00:01:29.620> and<00:01:30.670> along<00:01:31.670> with<00:01:31.730> that

00:01:31.930 --> 00:01:31.940 
so just like that and along with that

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:34.230 
so just like that and along with that
you're<00:01:32.720> also<00:01:32.840> going<00:01:33.050> to<00:01:33.110> push<00:01:33.380> with<00:01:33.620> your<00:01:33.740> left

00:01:34.230 --> 00:01:34.240 
you're also going to push with your left

00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:36.910 
you're also going to push with your left
but<00:01:35.240> it's<00:01:35.540> gonna<00:01:35.690> be<00:01:35.780> like<00:01:35.990> right<00:01:36.320> left<00:01:36.710> right

00:01:36.910 --> 00:01:36.920 
but it's gonna be like right left right

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:38.470 
but it's gonna be like right left right
left<00:01:37.100> right<00:01:37.670> left

00:01:38.470 --> 00:01:38.480 
left right left

00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:41.710 
left right left
you're<00:01:39.260> filling<00:01:39.590> moment<00:01:40.270> you'll<00:01:41.270> fill<00:01:41.540> it

00:01:41.710 --> 00:01:41.720 
you're filling moment you'll fill it

00:01:41.720 --> 00:01:45.670 
you're filling moment you'll fill it
once<00:01:42.440> you<00:01:42.530> started<00:01:42.800> doing<00:01:43.040> it<00:01:43.160> and<00:01:44.320> that's<00:01:45.320> I

00:01:45.670 --> 00:01:45.680 
once you started doing it and that's I

00:01:45.680 --> 00:01:48.310 
once you started doing it and that's I
think<00:01:45.920> that<00:01:46.370> might<00:01:46.580> be<00:01:46.610> the<00:01:47.480> hardest<00:01:47.780> part<00:01:47.930> is

00:01:48.310 --> 00:01:48.320 
think that might be the hardest part is

00:01:48.320 --> 00:01:51.040 
think that might be the hardest part is
just<00:01:48.380> getting<00:01:48.530> that<00:01:48.860> movement<00:01:49.340> of<00:01:50.050> the

00:01:51.040 --> 00:01:51.050 
just getting that movement of the

00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:52.900 
just getting that movement of the
bouncing<00:01:51.620> once<00:01:51.920> you<00:01:52.010> have<00:01:52.160> that<00:01:52.310> Creek<00:01:52.610> is<00:01:52.760> be

00:01:52.900 --> 00:01:52.910 
bouncing once you have that Creek is be

00:01:52.910 --> 00:01:57.250 
bouncing once you have that Creek is be
easier<00:01:53.470> so<00:01:54.470> yeah<00:01:55.780> let<00:01:56.780> me<00:01:56.840> show<00:01:56.990> it<00:01:57.020> to<00:01:57.110> you

00:01:57.250 --> 00:01:57.260 
easier so yeah let me show it to you

00:01:57.260 --> 00:02:05.620 
easier so yeah let me show it to you
I'll<00:01:57.620> do<00:01:57.830> them<00:01:57.950> slow<00:02:04.150> yeah<00:02:05.150> that<00:02:05.450> is<00:02:05.510> they're

00:02:05.620 --> 00:02:05.630 
I'll do them slow yeah that is they're

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:08.050 
I'll do them slow yeah that is they're
really<00:02:05.780> slow<00:02:05.990> quick<00:02:06.290> crickets<00:02:06.850> and<00:02:07.850> you<00:02:07.970> can

00:02:08.050 --> 00:02:08.060 
really slow quick crickets and you can

00:02:08.060 --> 00:02:10.449 
really slow quick crickets and you can
tell<00:02:08.179> they're<00:02:08.360> just<00:02:08.390> just<00:02:08.959> like<00:02:09.340> you<00:02:10.340> just

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:16.160 
switch them and along with that you're

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:19.479 
switch them and along with that you're
gonna<00:02:16.280> wanna<00:02:16.550> like<00:02:17.330> breathe<00:02:18.050> breathing<00:02:18.950> is

bouncing into your stomach so you like
pushing<00:02:29.530> the<00:02:29.560> air<00:02:29.770> out<00:02:29.800> of<00:02:30.100> you<00:02:30.340> so<00:02:30.900> just<00:02:31.900> be

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:32.050 
pushing the air out of you so just be

00:02:32.050 --> 00:02:35.070 
pushing the air out of you so just be
sure<00:02:32.080> to<00:02:32.200> breathe<00:02:32.530> and<00:02:33.210> you'll<00:02:34.210> you'll<00:02:34.960> be

00:02:35.070 --> 00:02:35.080 
sure to breathe and you'll you'll be

sure to breathe and you'll you'll be
okay<00:02:35.350> and<00:02:36.100> I<00:02:36.940> guess<00:02:37.150> your<00:02:37.690> wrist<00:02:37.900> will<00:02:38.050> start

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:38.230 
okay and I guess your wrist will start

00:02:38.230 --> 00:02:42.060 
okay and I guess your wrist will start
to<00:02:38.350> hurt<00:02:38.530> as<00:02:38.710> well<00:02:38.740> as<00:02:38.980> a<00:02:39.780> treacherous<00:02:40.860> or<00:02:41.860> not

00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:42.070 
to hurt as well as a treacherous or not

00:02:42.070 --> 00:02:45.960 
to hurt as well as a treacherous or not
and<00:02:42.970> a<00:02:43.780> good<00:02:44.170> way<00:02:44.290> to<00:02:44.350> practices<00:02:45.100> we'd<00:02:45.670> be<00:02:45.820> like

00:02:45.960 --> 00:02:45.970 
and a good way to practices we'd be like

00:02:45.970 --> 00:02:48.180 
and a good way to practices we'd be like
keep<00:02:46.240> your<00:02:46.360> feet<00:02:46.600> on<00:02:46.750> the<00:02:46.780> ground<00:02:47.010> and<00:02:48.010> just
