00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:36.469 
things another reason I separate the
salt<00:01:35.250> pepper<00:01:35.369> is<00:01:35.640> just<00:01:35.850> so<00:01:35.909> you<00:01:36.000> can<00:01:36.119> tell<00:01:36.329> them

00:01:36.469 --> 00:01:36.479 
salt pepper is just so you can tell them

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:37.999 
salt pepper is just so you can tell them
apart<00:01:36.600> I<00:01:37.049> mean<00:01:37.200> normally<00:01:37.560> it's<00:01:37.650> pretty<00:01:37.799> easy

00:01:37.999 --> 00:01:38.009 
apart I mean normally it's pretty easy

00:01:38.009 --> 00:01:39.140 
apart I mean normally it's pretty easy
like<00:01:38.280> it<00:01:38.310> becoming<00:01:38.729> different<00:01:39.000> color

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:39.150 
like it becoming different color

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:40.789 
like it becoming different color
containers<00:01:39.630> like<00:01:39.780> this<00:01:39.930> but<00:01:40.259> sometimes<00:01:40.680> they

00:01:40.789 --> 00:01:40.799 
containers like this but sometimes they

00:01:40.799 --> 00:01:42.140 
containers like this but sometimes they
come<00:01:40.979> in<00:01:41.100> containers<00:01:41.460> that<00:01:41.549> look<00:01:41.729> the<00:01:41.850> exact

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:42.150 
come in containers that look the exact

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:42.649 
come in containers that look the exact
same

00:01:42.649 --> 00:01:42.659 
same

00:01:42.659 --> 00:01:44.630 
same
like<00:01:42.960> this<00:01:43.229> and<00:01:43.500> then<00:01:44.040> what<00:01:44.189> do<00:01:44.250> you<00:01:44.310> do<00:01:44.460> you

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:44.640 
like this and then what do you do you

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:45.830 
like this and then what do you do you
could<00:01:44.790> just<00:01:44.970> pour<00:01:45.119> some<00:01:45.149> out<00:01:45.360> to<00:01:45.420> see<00:01:45.630> what's

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:45.840 
could just pour some out to see what's

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:47.210 
could just pour some out to see what's
in<00:01:46.020> there<00:01:46.259> but<00:01:46.439> you<00:01:46.530> might<00:01:46.710> not<00:01:46.829> want<00:01:47.040> to<00:01:47.070> risk

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:47.220 
in there but you might not want to risk

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:47.510 
in there but you might not want to risk
that

00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:47.520 
that

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:48.950 
that
so<00:01:47.759> the<00:01:47.850> other<00:01:48.030> way<00:01:48.119> to<00:01:48.180> tell<00:01:48.420> and<00:01:48.630> I<00:01:48.689> found

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:48.960 
so the other way to tell and I found

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:50.149 
so the other way to tell and I found
that<00:01:49.049> a<00:01:49.110> lot<00:01:49.290> of<00:01:49.320> people<00:01:49.560> don't<00:01:49.740> actually<00:01:49.829> know

00:01:50.149 --> 00:01:50.159 
that a lot of people don't actually know

00:01:50.159 --> 00:01:52.219 
that a lot of people don't actually know
this<00:01:50.369> is<00:01:50.549> that<00:01:50.729> salt<00:01:51.030> always<00:01:51.570> has<00:01:51.780> more<00:01:51.990> holes

00:01:52.219 --> 00:01:52.229 
this is that salt always has more holes

00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:53.300 
this is that salt always has more holes
on<00:01:52.470> the<00:01:52.560> top<00:01:52.590> ooh

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:53.310 
on the top ooh

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:55.370 
on the top ooh
mud<00:01:53.880> and<00:01:53.909> blowing<00:01:54.420> right<00:01:54.630> so<00:01:54.930> once<00:01:55.079> you<00:01:55.170> figure

00:01:55.370 --> 00:01:55.380 
mud and blowing right so once you figure

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:56.569 
mud and blowing right so once you figure
out<00:01:55.409> what<00:01:55.590> shaker<00:01:55.829> you<00:01:55.950> have<00:01:56.159> you<00:01:56.310> just<00:01:56.430> have

00:01:56.569 --> 00:01:56.579 
out what shaker you have you just have

00:01:56.579 --> 00:01:58.190 
out what shaker you have you just have

00:01:59.959 --> 00:01:59.969 
wrong cuz sometimes you have to solve is

00:01:59.969 --> 00:02:01.550 
wrong cuz sometimes you have to solve is
like<00:02:00.090> really<00:02:00.299> clogged<00:02:00.750> in<00:02:00.869> there<00:02:01.079> that's<00:02:01.380> tiny
