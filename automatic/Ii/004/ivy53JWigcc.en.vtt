00:00:38.609 --> 00:00:45.559

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:13.610
 mistakes because it's all cost 

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:15.799

00:01:13.610 --> 00:01:16.840
 cei stay navigate fact is the

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:39.570
 2 

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:46.880
 first day of race in marseille two 

00:01:45.829 --> 00:01:48.890
 races for both groups 

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:50.930
 the conditions remain fantastic with 

00:01:48.890 --> 00:01:53.469
 the sun and a very thermal breeze 

00:01:50.930 --> 00:01:53.469
 irregular 

00:01:53.850 --> 00:02:00.860
 Well, it's hot the first time 

00:01:58.439 --> 00:02:00.860
 the first 

00:02:05.320 --> 00:02:08.410
 yeah we did two runs 

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:10.990
 today the first one went very well 

00:02:08.410 --> 00:02:13.420
 past because we win it in fact we have 

00:02:10.990 --> 00:02:15.430
 took a great start and after that was 

00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:17.650
 a lot easier for to stay 

00:02:15.430 --> 00:02:20.220
 in front of the coup here we come to 

00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:26.080
 keep the place and won the round 

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:28.780
 the first a very beautiful first 

00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:30.250
 sleeve or a little lucky on the start 

00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:32.140
 we did not have the same right to a line 

00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:34.450
 extremely supportive starting left 

00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:38.050
 difficult to cross and finally in 

00:02:34.450 --> 00:02:38.800
 a 360 under the line sinking port port 

00:02:38.050 --> 00:02:40.510
 tack 

00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:42.010
 it was good then we had a 

00:02:40.510 --> 00:02:44.110
 race committee that fought with the 

00:02:42.010 --> 00:02:45.820
 wind and then who found the area anymore 

00:02:44.110 --> 00:02:54.880
 windy from the bay and we did a great 

00:02:45.820 --> 00:02:56.440
 second inning with 15.2 good it was 

00:02:54.880 --> 00:02:58.900
 went very well for us but it was 

00:02:56.440 --> 00:03:00.220
 really difficult because at the beginning it 

00:02:58.900 --> 00:03:04.240
 there was not much wind whose 

00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:06.400
 first regatta was your madness after 

00:03:04.240 --> 00:03:08.080
 he had a nice wind in front of 

00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:12.280
 the east and we learned to do the regatta 

00:03:08.080 --> 00:03:14.260
 with 15.9 as long as it was two things 

00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:16.620
 completely different and whose 

00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:19.420
 second is going to be awesome rain work 

00:03:16.620 --> 00:03:22.120
 front from the start and we no longer 

00:03:19.420 --> 00:03:23.800
 won the war think it's great 

00:03:22.120 --> 00:03:27.840
 did not think started as well 

00:03:23.800 --> 00:03:27.840
 still very long
