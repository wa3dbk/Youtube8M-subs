00:00:00.589 --> 00:00:09.870
 hello present to your attention 

00:00:03.799 --> 00:00:12.559
 car receiver kenwood kmm 357 sd in 

00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:14.340
 This video is just unpacking the box. 

00:00:12.559 --> 00:00:17.460
 no connections 

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:19.260
 inclusions just for you to represent 

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:24.320
 what is waiting for you when buying inside 

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:24.320
 the box looks like this 

00:00:32.500 --> 00:00:36.610
 so that looks from the back side 

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:56.480
 start spending on the very top of us 

00:00:52.480 --> 00:00:57.649
 is an adapter for connecting the adapter 

00:00:56.480 --> 00:01:02.649
 by connector 

00:00:57.649 --> 00:01:02.649
 of and so here it looks 

00:01:06.070 --> 00:01:19.119
 there are such inscriptions remont i can't seconds 

00:01:13.479 --> 00:01:19.119
 newt so 

00:02:04.220 --> 00:02:12.649
 so that we are actually very 

00:02:09.959 --> 00:02:12.649
 radio cassette player 

00:02:14.090 --> 00:02:28.519
 the key is probably a forecast for us sachets here 

00:02:23.489 --> 00:02:35.730
 There is a cover apparently for the front panel 

00:02:28.519 --> 00:02:38.180
 Cover slightly shiny exactly soft 

00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:38.180
 thin 

00:02:44.200 --> 00:02:55.300
 so that's the way 

00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:58.720
 the radio tape recorder was bought for 2300 10 rubles 

00:02:55.300 --> 00:03:05.069
 in technopoint technopoint point 

00:02:58.720 --> 00:03:15.540
 py 21st march 2014 

00:03:05.069 --> 00:03:24.040
 so what can we do with this table kenn 

00:03:15.540 --> 00:03:26.610
 its cartes well instruction even 2 heme 

00:03:24.040 --> 00:03:26.610
 for different languages 

00:03:28.769 --> 00:03:34.380
 we see all this is not his Russian audi say 

00:03:31.930 --> 00:03:34.380
 in Russian 

00:03:43.900 --> 00:03:50.480
 I 'll take a bigger picture later 

00:03:46.970 --> 00:04:04.060
 that everything was visible and lay out a reference under 

00:03:50.480 --> 00:04:04.060
 video reached the Russian instruction 

00:04:25.440 --> 00:04:43.530
 inside the house figured out that from 

00:04:39.550 --> 00:04:43.530
 is not ashamed of himself 

00:04:46.940 --> 00:04:54.650
 the radio tape recorder to tell everything is very small 

00:04:49.580 --> 00:04:55.730
 in depth that's all centimeters probably 

00:04:54.650 --> 00:04:58.690
 about ten 

00:04:55.730 --> 00:04:58.690
 maybe 12 

00:05:08.170 --> 00:05:12.310
 so here years back panel 

00:05:27.770 --> 00:05:40.069
 pulled out on the blank of the written 

00:06:09.930 --> 00:06:14.060
 I hope it is clear that I am showing 

00:06:19.689 --> 00:06:26.199
 this sd card compartment and 

00:06:22.779 --> 00:06:33.819
 Aux input here and so it opens 

00:06:26.199 --> 00:06:37.499
 closes here is inserted yusbi 

00:06:33.819 --> 00:06:37.499
 here 35 jack 

00:06:43.750 --> 00:06:49.810
 This is the black dot. I'm not acting yet. 

00:06:47.620 --> 00:06:52.780
 I know that this is for sure, but I guess something 

00:06:49.810 --> 00:06:54.940
 some kind of light sensor to 

00:06:52.780 --> 00:06:59.590
 included there day and night mode 

00:06:54.940 --> 00:07:07.990
 backlight is just a hypothesis at the very 

00:06:59.590 --> 00:07:11.400
 I donâ€™t know exactly what it is 

00:07:07.990 --> 00:07:11.400
 all I wanted to show you 

00:07:14.190 --> 00:07:22.620
