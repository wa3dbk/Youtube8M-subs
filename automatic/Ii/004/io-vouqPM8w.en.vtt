me and my love are sungazing and some
people<00:00:03.990> think<00:00:04.410> that's<00:00:04.680> really<00:00:05.069> weird<00:00:05.220> but<00:00:05.730> I

people think that's really weird but I

00:00:05.940 --> 00:00:08.509 
people think that's really weird but I
will<00:00:06.120> tell<00:00:06.330> you<00:00:06.450> what<00:00:06.600> if<00:00:06.720> sungazing<00:00:07.049> is<00:00:07.519> what

00:00:08.509 --> 00:00:08.519 
will tell you what if sungazing is what

00:00:08.519 --> 00:00:11.900 
will tell you what if sungazing is what
it<00:00:08.610> is<00:00:08.730> is<00:00:08.940> when<00:00:09.090> the<00:00:09.540> Sun<00:00:09.809> is<00:00:10.370> at<00:00:11.370> a<00:00:11.429> certain

00:00:11.900 --> 00:00:11.910 
it is is when the Sun is at a certain

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:14.270 
it is is when the Sun is at a certain
height<00:00:12.599> from<00:00:12.870> the<00:00:12.990> sky<00:00:13.200> which<00:00:13.440> is<00:00:13.590> about<00:00:13.769> 45

00:00:14.270 --> 00:00:14.280 
height from the sky which is about 45

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:17.870 
height from the sky which is about 45
minutes<00:00:15.049> before<00:00:16.049> after<00:00:16.650> it<00:00:16.980> rises<00:00:17.400> or<00:00:17.520> sets<00:00:17.550> so

00:00:17.870 --> 00:00:17.880 
minutes before after it rises or sets so

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:20.240 
minutes before after it rises or sets so
before<00:00:18.539> it<00:00:18.630> sets<00:00:18.869> or<00:00:19.080> after<00:00:19.410> it<00:00:19.500> Rises<00:00:19.859> within

before it sets or after it Rises within
45<00:00:20.820> minutes<00:00:20.960> it's<00:00:21.960> a<00:00:22.080> safe<00:00:22.289> zone<00:00:22.560> and<00:00:22.769> that

00:00:22.849 --> 00:00:22.859 
45 minutes it's a safe zone and that

00:00:22.859 --> 00:00:24.710 
45 minutes it's a safe zone and that
safe<00:00:23.130> zone<00:00:23.160> means<00:00:24.090> that<00:00:24.300> you<00:00:24.390> could<00:00:24.539> actually

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:24.720 
safe zone means that you could actually

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:26.870 
safe zone means that you could actually
stare<00:00:25.140> directly<00:00:25.769> into<00:00:26.099> the<00:00:26.279> Sun<00:00:26.519> obviously

00:00:26.870 --> 00:00:26.880 
stare directly into the Sun obviously

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:28.700 
stare directly into the Sun obviously
you<00:00:27.480> uh<00:00:27.510> you<00:00:27.930> know<00:00:28.050> you<00:00:28.199> want<00:00:28.349> to<00:00:28.380> be<00:00:28.470> careful

00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:28.710 
you uh you know you want to be careful

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:30.650 
you uh you know you want to be careful
start<00:00:29.070> out<00:00:29.220> when<00:00:29.340> it's<00:00:29.490> the<00:00:29.609> lowest<00:00:29.970> and<00:00:30.210> then

00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:30.660 
start out when it's the lowest and then

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:32.630 
start out when it's the lowest and then
work<00:00:30.869> your<00:00:31.019> way<00:00:31.080> up<00:00:31.189> start<00:00:32.189> out<00:00:32.309> with<00:00:32.430> ten

work your way up start out with ten

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:34.790 
work your way up start out with ten
seconds<00:00:33.149> and<00:00:33.329> then<00:00:33.899> from<00:00:34.170> there<00:00:34.350> you<00:00:34.469> go<00:00:34.559> ten

00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:34.800 
seconds and then from there you go ten

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:37.430 
seconds and then from there you go ten

seconds 20 seconds 30 seconds what it

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:39.020 
seconds 20 seconds 30 seconds what it
does<00:00:37.620> is<00:00:37.890> the<00:00:38.040> Sun<00:00:38.250> is<00:00:38.489> actually<00:00:38.820> extremely

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:39.030 
does is the Sun is actually extremely

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:42.619 
does is the Sun is actually extremely
good<00:00:39.780> for<00:00:40.590> your<00:00:40.860> brain<00:00:41.190> primal<00:00:41.700> gland<00:00:42.030> and<00:00:42.270> to

00:00:42.619 --> 00:00:42.629 
good for your brain primal gland and to

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:44.110 
good for your brain primal gland and to
activate<00:00:43.050> your<00:00:43.170> DNA

00:00:44.110 --> 00:00:44.120 
activate your DNA

00:00:44.120 --> 00:00:46.190 
activate your DNA
modern<00:00:45.120> science<00:00:45.539> will<00:00:45.690> not<00:00:45.809> tell<00:00:45.989> you<00:00:46.079> this

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:46.200 
modern science will not tell you this

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:47.779 
modern science will not tell you this
because<00:00:46.559> they<00:00:46.710> do<00:00:46.800> not<00:00:46.950> want<00:00:47.190> you<00:00:47.309> to<00:00:47.399> activate

00:00:47.779 --> 00:00:47.789 
because they do not want you to activate

00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:49.850 
because they do not want you to activate
your<00:00:47.940> DNA<00:00:48.329> or<00:00:48.750> absorb<00:00:49.200> Sun<00:00:49.440> into<00:00:49.649> your<00:00:49.710> eyes

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:49.860 
your DNA or absorb Sun into your eyes

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:51.470 
your DNA or absorb Sun into your eyes
which<00:00:50.100> is<00:00:50.250> why<00:00:50.340> they<00:00:50.460> say<00:00:50.610> the<00:00:50.730> Sun<00:00:50.910> is<00:00:51.030> bad<00:00:51.210> for

00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:51.480 
which is why they say the Sun is bad for

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:53.990 
which is why they say the Sun is bad for
you<00:00:51.570> and<00:00:51.600> to<00:00:51.989> put<00:00:52.140> on<00:00:52.230> sunglasses<00:00:52.850> when<00:00:53.850> the

00:00:53.990 --> 00:00:54.000 
you and to put on sunglasses when the

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:57.400 
you and to put on sunglasses when the
Sun<00:00:54.210> is<00:00:54.390> at<00:00:54.809> peak<00:00:55.079> or<00:00:55.320> a<00:00:55.379> noon<00:00:55.829> or<00:00:56.399> anywhere

00:00:57.400 --> 00:00:57.410 
Sun is at peak or a noon or anywhere

00:00:57.410 --> 00:01:00.470 
Sun is at peak or a noon or anywhere
close<00:00:58.410> to<00:00:58.440> straight<00:00:59.129> up<00:00:59.160> in<00:00:59.370> the<00:00:59.430> sky<00:00:59.640> it<00:01:00.270> will

00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:00.480 
close to straight up in the sky it will

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:01.910 
close to straight up in the sky it will
burn<00:01:00.719> your<00:01:00.840> eyes<00:01:00.989> out<00:01:01.170> so<00:01:01.379> do<00:01:01.469> not<00:01:01.500> look<00:01:01.739> at<00:01:01.829> the

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:01.920 
burn your eyes out so do not look at the

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:03.319 
burn your eyes out so do not look at the
Sun<00:01:02.100> then<00:01:02.280> I<00:01:02.460> would<00:01:02.699> never<00:01:02.789> recommend<00:01:03.059> that

00:01:03.319 --> 00:01:03.329 
Sun then I would never recommend that

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:05.690 
Sun then I would never recommend that
but<00:01:04.080> they've<00:01:04.260> done<00:01:04.470> many<00:01:04.949> studies<00:01:05.070> on<00:01:05.430> people

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:05.700 
but they've done many studies on people

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:07.370 
but they've done many studies on people
that<00:01:05.820> Sun<00:01:06.000> gaze<00:01:06.240> every<00:01:06.540> single<00:01:06.840> day<00:01:06.990> and<00:01:07.229> they

00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:07.380 
that Sun gaze every single day and they

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:09.530 
that Sun gaze every single day and they
have<00:01:07.590> 20/20<00:01:08.220> eye<00:01:08.250> vision<00:01:08.640> and<00:01:08.939> no<00:01:09.090> damage<00:01:09.330> to

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:09.540 
have 20/20 eye vision and no damage to

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:11.980 
have 20/20 eye vision and no damage to
the<00:01:09.689> eyes<00:01:09.900> while<00:01:10.710> looking<00:01:11.010> at<00:01:11.159> the<00:01:11.280> Sun<00:01:11.520> for

00:01:11.980 --> 00:01:11.990 
the eyes while looking at the Sun for

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:15.350 
the eyes while looking at the Sun for
some<00:01:12.990> of<00:01:13.080> them<00:01:13.200> up<00:01:13.320> to<00:01:13.350> 40<00:01:13.740> minutes<00:01:13.860> a<00:01:14.070> day<00:01:14.360> when

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:15.360 
some of them up to 40 minutes a day when

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:17.990 
some of them up to 40 minutes a day when
it's<00:01:15.509> at<00:01:15.930> the<00:01:15.990> proper<00:01:16.439> height<00:01:16.680> so<00:01:17.549> Sun

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:18.000 
it's at the proper height so Sun

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:20.870 
it's at the proper height so Sun
actually<00:01:18.689> does<00:01:18.960> increase<00:01:19.320> your<00:01:19.920> intelligence

00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:20.880 
actually does increase your intelligence

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:24.530 
actually does increase your intelligence
by<00:01:21.090> activating<00:01:21.570> your<00:01:21.750> DNA<00:01:22.280> again<00:01:23.540> proper

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:24.540 
by activating your DNA again proper

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:26.480 
by activating your DNA again proper
science<00:01:24.900> or<00:01:25.080> mainstream<00:01:25.890> science<00:01:26.310> will<00:01:26.400> not

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:26.490 
science or mainstream science will not

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:28.370 
science or mainstream science will not
tell<00:01:26.670> you<00:01:26.759> this<00:01:26.880> so<00:01:27.180> if<00:01:27.630> you<00:01:27.750> go<00:01:27.900> and<00:01:28.049> see<00:01:28.229> if

00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:28.380 
tell you this so if you go and see if

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:30.469 
tell you this so if you go and see if
this<00:01:28.560> is<00:01:28.710> just<00:01:28.829> a<00:01:28.979> bunch<00:01:29.130> of<00:01:29.280> baloney<00:01:29.479> there

00:01:30.469 --> 00:01:30.479 
this is just a bunch of baloney there

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:31.730 
this is just a bunch of baloney there
may<00:01:30.600> be<00:01:30.630> a<00:01:30.780> lot<00:01:31.020> of<00:01:31.049> people<00:01:31.200> that<00:01:31.500> say<00:01:31.619> it's

00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:31.740 
may be a lot of people that say it's

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:33.679 
may be a lot of people that say it's
baloney<00:01:32.009> but<00:01:32.310> it<00:01:32.430> is<00:01:32.520> a<00:01:32.549> fact<00:01:32.850> because<00:01:33.270> I<00:01:33.450> Sun

00:01:33.679 --> 00:01:33.689 
baloney but it is a fact because I Sun

00:01:33.689 --> 00:01:35.990 
baloney but it is a fact because I Sun
gaze<00:01:33.900> and<00:01:34.110> my<00:01:34.350> DNA<00:01:34.710> activated<00:01:35.400> and<00:01:35.610> I<00:01:35.729> filled

gaze and my DNA activated and I filled

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:38.929 
gaze and my DNA activated and I filled
