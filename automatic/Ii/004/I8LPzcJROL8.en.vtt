to<00:02:12.770> do<00:02:12.830> the<00:02:12.980> exact<00:02:13.220> same<00:02:13.250> thing<00:02:13.700> that<00:02:13.820> you<00:02:13.940> just

00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:14.180 
to do the exact same thing that you just

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:16.960 
to do the exact same thing that you just
did<00:02:14.420> all<00:02:14.690> the<00:02:15.020> way<00:02:15.110> around<00:02:15.230> other<00:02:15.800> side<00:02:16.160> until

00:02:16.960 --> 00:02:16.970 
did all the way around other side until

00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:23.950 
did all the way around other side until
it<00:02:17.420> looks<00:02:17.600> like<00:02:17.900> this

00:02:23.950 --> 00:02:23.960 

00:02:23.960 --> 00:02:26.170 

now<00:02:24.560> that<00:02:24.740> I'm<00:02:24.830> closer<00:02:25.160> to<00:02:25.280> the<00:02:25.490> top<00:02:25.730> I<00:02:26.000> have

00:02:26.170 --> 00:02:26.180 
now that I'm closer to the top I have

00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:29.290 
now that I'm closer to the top I have
shorter<00:02:26.750> layers<00:02:27.700> so<00:02:28.700> I'm<00:02:28.760> just<00:02:28.910> going<00:02:29.030> to<00:02:29.090> grab

00:02:29.290 --> 00:02:29.300 
shorter layers so I'm just going to grab

00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:31.000 
shorter layers so I'm just going to grab
the<00:02:29.720> shortest<00:02:30.140> layers<00:02:30.350> that<00:02:30.530> are<00:02:30.590> on<00:02:30.770> top<00:02:30.980> of

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:31.010 
the shortest layers that are on top of

00:02:31.010 --> 00:02:38.080 
the shortest layers that are on top of
my<00:02:31.370> head<00:02:31.550> and<00:02:31.610> pull<00:02:32.150> them<00:02:32.240> aside<00:02:36.820> I'm<00:02:37.820> going<00:02:37.970> to

00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:38.090 
my head and pull them aside I'm going to

00:02:38.090 --> 00:02:42.700 
my head and pull them aside I'm going to
do<00:02:38.210> that<00:02:38.360> on<00:02:38.510> both<00:02:38.540> sides

00:02:42.700 --> 00:02:42.710 

00:02:42.710 --> 00:02:46.490 

and<00:02:43.700> clip<00:02:43.970> them<00:02:44.210> in<00:02:44.330> place

00:02:46.490 --> 00:02:46.500 
and clip them in place

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:51.650 
and clip them in place
now<00:02:47.220> when<00:02:47.430> I<00:02:47.460> curl<00:02:47.880> these<00:02:48.690> shorter<00:02:49.440> pieces<00:02:50.660> i'm

00:02:51.650 --> 00:02:51.660 
now when I curl these shorter pieces i'm

00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:54.980 
now when I curl these shorter pieces i'm
going<00:02:51.840> to<00:02:51.930> start<00:02:52.320> it<00:02:52.530> a<00:02:52.770> few<00:02:53.760> inches<00:02:53.820> away<00:02:54.660> from

00:02:54.980 --> 00:02:54.990 
going to start it a few inches away from

00:02:54.990 --> 00:02:57.470 
going to start it a few inches away from
the<00:02:55.350> root<00:02:55.560> so<00:02:56.550> this<00:02:56.730> is<00:02:56.880> what<00:02:57.030> I<00:02:57.060> should<00:02:57.300> look

00:02:57.470 --> 00:02:57.480 
the root so this is what I should look

00:02:57.480 --> 00:03:00.110 
the root so this is what I should look
like<00:02:57.540> and<00:02:58.020> now<00:02:58.170> I<00:02:58.200> only<00:02:58.470> have<00:02:58.590> the<00:02:58.920> very<00:02:59.460> top

00:03:00.110 --> 00:03:00.120 
like and now I only have the very top

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:02.980 
like and now I only have the very top
layers<00:03:00.480> left<00:03:00.900> the<00:03:01.230> shortest<00:03:01.650> layers<00:03:01.830> of<00:03:02.100> all

00:03:02.980 --> 00:03:02.990 
layers left the shortest layers of all

00:03:02.990 --> 00:03:05.270 
layers left the shortest layers of all
so<00:03:03.990> I'm<00:03:04.110> just<00:03:04.290> going<00:03:04.470> to<00:03:04.560> basically<00:03:04.830> do<00:03:05.250> the

00:03:05.270 --> 00:03:05.280 
so I'm just going to basically do the

00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:07.720 
so I'm just going to basically do the
same<00:03:05.400> thing<00:03:05.910> that<00:03:06.060> I<00:03:06.150> just<00:03:06.420> did<00:03:06.720> previously

00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:07.730 
same thing that I just did previously

00:03:07.730 --> 00:03:11.060 
same thing that I just did previously
grab<00:03:08.730> the<00:03:08.880> shorter<00:03:09.180> layers<00:03:09.420> I<00:03:09.870> like<00:03:10.740> to<00:03:10.860> tease

00:03:11.060 --> 00:03:11.070 
grab the shorter layers I like to tease

00:03:11.070 --> 00:03:12.500 
grab the shorter layers I like to tease
mind<00:03:11.400> a<00:03:11.459> little<00:03:11.580> bit<00:03:11.760> at<00:03:11.910> the<00:03:11.940> top<00:03:12.030> just<00:03:12.240> to

00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:12.510 
mind a little bit at the top just to

00:03:12.510 --> 00:03:20.100 
mind a little bit at the top just to
give<00:03:12.690> a<00:03:12.720> bit<00:03:12.930> more<00:03:12.959> volume

00:03:20.100 --> 00:03:20.110 

00:03:20.110 --> 00:03:22.420 

now<00:03:21.110> I'm<00:03:21.260> just<00:03:21.380> going<00:03:21.500> to<00:03:21.680> take<00:03:21.830> that<00:03:22.070> piece

00:03:22.420 --> 00:03:22.430 
now I'm just going to take that piece

00:03:22.430 --> 00:03:24.610 
now I'm just going to take that piece
and<00:03:23.060> starting<00:03:23.420> a<00:03:23.480> few<00:03:23.660> inches<00:03:23.810> down<00:03:24.140> from<00:03:24.200> my

00:03:24.610 --> 00:03:24.620 
and starting a few inches down from my

00:03:24.620 --> 00:03:26.350 
and starting a few inches down from my
roots<00:03:24.860> again<00:03:25.040> I'm<00:03:25.520> just<00:03:25.640> going<00:03:25.730> to<00:03:25.850> wrap<00:03:26.120> the

00:03:26.350 --> 00:03:26.360 
roots again I'm just going to wrap the

00:03:26.360 --> 00:03:36.010 
roots again I'm just going to wrap the
ends<00:03:26.590> just<00:03:27.590> to<00:03:27.710> give<00:03:27.860> it<00:03:27.890> a<00:03:28.160> nice<00:03:28.370> wave

00:03:36.010 --> 00:03:36.020 

00:03:36.020 --> 00:03:53.640 

you

00:03:53.640 --> 00:03:53.650 

00:03:53.650 --> 00:03:56.350 

now<00:03:54.650> do<00:03:54.710> the<00:03:55.010> exact<00:03:55.310> same<00:03:55.340> thing<00:03:55.880> on<00:03:56.210> the<00:03:56.330> other

00:03:56.350 --> 00:03:56.360 
now do the exact same thing on the other

00:03:56.360 --> 00:04:00.760 
now do the exact same thing on the other
side<00:03:57.340> then<00:03:58.340> you'll<00:03:58.490> be<00:03:58.550> finished<00:03:59.620> and<00:04:00.620> it

00:04:00.760 --> 00:04:00.770 
side then you'll be finished and it

00:04:00.770 --> 00:04:06.570 
side then you'll be finished and it
should<00:04:00.920> look<00:04:01.040> a<00:04:01.100> little<00:04:01.370> something<00:04:01.850> like<00:04:01.970> this

00:04:06.570 --> 00:04:06.580 

00:04:06.580 --> 00:04:09.400 

now<00:04:07.580> i'm<00:04:07.730> taking<00:04:07.760> my<00:04:08.270> hair<00:04:08.540> spray<00:04:08.900> you<00:04:09.200> don't

00:04:09.400 --> 00:04:09.410 
now i'm taking my hair spray you don't

00:04:09.410 --> 00:04:10.630 
now i'm taking my hair spray you don't
have<00:04:09.650> to<00:04:09.830> use<00:04:09.920> hairspray<00:04:10.190> on<00:04:10.370> these

00:04:10.630 --> 00:04:10.640 
have to use hairspray on these

00:04:10.640 --> 00:04:12.550 
have to use hairspray on these
extensions<00:04:10.970> but<00:04:11.420> i<00:04:11.480> like<00:04:11.810> to<00:04:11.990> just<00:04:12.140> because<00:04:12.440> my

00:04:12.550 --> 00:04:12.560 
extensions but i like to just because my

00:04:12.560 --> 00:04:15.220 
extensions but i like to just because my
natural<00:04:13.040> hair<00:04:13.540> definitely<00:04:14.540> definitely<00:04:14.690> needs

00:04:15.220 --> 00:04:15.230 
natural hair definitely definitely needs

00:04:15.230 --> 00:04:17.410 
natural hair definitely definitely needs
hairspray<00:04:15.800> or<00:04:16.370> else<00:04:16.489> it<00:04:16.640> would<00:04:16.730> just<00:04:16.820> be<00:04:16.970> flat

00:04:17.410 --> 00:04:17.420 
hairspray or else it would just be flat

00:04:17.420 --> 00:04:20.590 
hairspray or else it would just be flat
way<00:04:17.840> sooner<00:04:18.290> than<00:04:18.320> the<00:04:18.980> extensions<00:04:19.609> so<00:04:20.060> i'm

00:04:20.590 --> 00:04:20.600 
way sooner than the extensions so i'm

00:04:20.600 --> 00:04:22.420 
way sooner than the extensions so i'm
just<00:04:20.660> spraying<00:04:21.109> it<00:04:21.320> and<00:04:21.500> then<00:04:21.590> I'm<00:04:21.680> crunching

00:04:22.420 --> 00:04:22.430 
just spraying it and then I'm crunching

00:04:22.430 --> 00:04:26.830 
just spraying it and then I'm crunching
it<00:04:22.520> upwards<00:04:25.120> now<00:04:26.120> I'm<00:04:26.240> going<00:04:26.390> to<00:04:26.480> grab<00:04:26.630> that

00:04:26.830 --> 00:04:26.840 
it upwards now I'm going to grab that

00:04:26.840 --> 00:04:30.310 
it upwards now I'm going to grab that
big<00:04:27.290> tooth<00:04:27.920> comb<00:04:28.520> and<00:04:28.910> I'm<00:04:29.450> just<00:04:29.660> going<00:04:29.840> to<00:04:29.990> run

00:04:30.310 --> 00:04:30.320 
big tooth comb and I'm just going to run

00:04:30.320 --> 00:04:33.040 
big tooth comb and I'm just going to run
that<00:04:30.500> through<00:04:31.070> the<00:04:31.820> curls<00:04:32.180> but<00:04:32.570> I'm<00:04:32.660> not<00:04:32.690> going

00:04:33.040 --> 00:04:33.050 
that through the curls but I'm not going

00:04:33.050 --> 00:04:34.330 
that through the curls but I'm not going
to<00:04:33.110> run<00:04:33.290> it<00:04:33.440> all<00:04:33.620> the<00:04:33.650> way<00:04:33.830> through<00:04:34.040> I'm<00:04:34.160> just

00:04:34.330 --> 00:04:34.340 
to run it all the way through I'm just

00:04:34.340 --> 00:04:36.010 
to run it all the way through I'm just
going<00:04:34.520> to<00:04:34.550> kind<00:04:34.760> of<00:04:34.790> do<00:04:34.940> it<00:04:35.060> in<00:04:35.210> sections<00:04:35.480> like

00:04:36.010 --> 00:04:36.020 
going to kind of do it in sections like

00:04:36.020 --> 00:04:40.330 
going to kind of do it in sections like
this<00:04:37.030> just<00:04:38.030> to<00:04:38.180> kind<00:04:38.420> of<00:04:38.920> break<00:04:39.920> it<00:04:40.100> up<00:04:40.220> a

00:04:40.330 --> 00:04:40.340 
this just to kind of break it up a

00:04:40.340 --> 00:04:44.260 
this just to kind of break it up a
little<00:04:40.550> bit<00:04:40.670> but<00:04:41.180> still<00:04:41.690> keep<00:04:42.650> it<00:04:42.860> together<00:04:43.610> if

00:04:44.260 --> 00:04:44.270 
little bit but still keep it together if

00:04:44.270 --> 00:04:46.120 
little bit but still keep it together if
that<00:04:44.480> makes<00:04:44.690> any<00:04:44.840> sense<00:04:45.080> at<00:04:45.440> all<00:04:45.470> you<00:04:45.830> can<00:04:45.980> see

00:04:46.120 --> 00:04:46.130 
that makes any sense at all you can see

00:04:46.130 --> 00:04:47.650 
that makes any sense at all you can see
that<00:04:46.280> it's<00:04:46.430> just<00:04:46.610> kind<00:04:46.790> of<00:04:46.850> making<00:04:47.030> it<00:04:47.240> softer

00:04:47.650 --> 00:04:47.660 
that it's just kind of making it softer

00:04:47.660 --> 00:04:48.730 
that it's just kind of making it softer
looking<00:04:47.930> and<00:04:48.050> getting<00:04:48.230> rid<00:04:48.320> of<00:04:48.410> that<00:04:48.560> like

00:04:48.730 --> 00:04:48.740 
looking and getting rid of that like

00:04:48.740 --> 00:05:06.719 
looking and getting rid of that like
crunchiness<00:04:49.220> from<00:04:49.430> the<00:04:49.790> hairspray
