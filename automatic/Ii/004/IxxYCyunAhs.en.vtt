don't<00:00:14.370> know<00:00:14.490> if<00:00:14.580> you<00:00:14.670> can<00:00:14.790> really<00:00:15.120> see<00:00:15.420> it<00:00:15.509> but

00:00:15.799 --> 00:00:15.809 
don't know if you can really see it but

00:00:15.809 --> 00:00:17.300 
don't know if you can really see it but
what<00:00:16.020> I<00:00:16.049> ended<00:00:16.289> up<00:00:16.410> doing<00:00:16.590> is<00:00:16.800> just<00:00:16.980> drilling

00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:17.310 
what I ended up doing is just drilling

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:19.670 
what I ended up doing is just drilling
the<00:00:17.520> stud<00:00:17.789> out<00:00:17.820> and<00:00:18.750> I<00:00:18.869> went<00:00:19.080> one<00:00:19.230> drill<00:00:19.500> bit

00:00:19.670 --> 00:00:19.680 
the stud out and I went one drill bit

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:21.349 
the stud out and I went one drill bit
size<00:00:20.070> bigger<00:00:20.580> and<00:00:20.789> bigger<00:00:21.000> and<00:00:21.090> bigger<00:00:21.150> until

00:00:21.349 --> 00:00:21.359 
size bigger and bigger and bigger until

00:00:21.359 --> 00:00:23.870 
size bigger and bigger and bigger until
I<00:00:21.689> just<00:00:21.750> uncovered<00:00:22.320> the<00:00:22.830> the<00:00:23.369> threads<00:00:23.699> in

00:00:23.870 --> 00:00:23.880 
I just uncovered the the threads in

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:26.029 
I just uncovered the the threads in
there<00:00:24.090> so<00:00:24.689> you<00:00:25.320> know<00:00:25.410> the<00:00:25.590> threads<00:00:25.830> of<00:00:26.010> the

00:00:26.029 --> 00:00:26.039 
there so you know the threads of the

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:27.740 
there so you know the threads of the
bolt<00:00:26.099> were<00:00:26.430> still<00:00:26.730> stuck<00:00:27.060> in<00:00:27.180> the<00:00:27.300> threads<00:00:27.539> of

00:00:27.740 --> 00:00:27.750 
bolt were still stuck in the threads of

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:31.640 
bolt were still stuck in the threads of
the<00:00:27.779> the<00:00:28.710> weight<00:00:29.330> basically<00:00:30.330> so<00:00:31.170> now<00:00:31.289> all<00:00:31.500> I'm

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:31.650 
the the weight basically so now all I'm

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:33.200 
the the weight basically so now all I'm
doing<00:00:31.920> is<00:00:32.009> tapping<00:00:32.250> this<00:00:32.520> out<00:00:32.730> and<00:00:32.880> I<00:00:32.910> had<00:00:33.059> the

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:33.210 
doing is tapping this out and I had the

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:34.880 
doing is tapping this out and I had the
I<00:00:33.420> had<00:00:33.660> it<00:00:33.780> started<00:00:33.960> in<00:00:34.230> there<00:00:34.380> I<00:00:34.410> backed<00:00:34.739> it

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:34.890 
I had it started in there I backed it

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:37.400 
I had it started in there I backed it
out<00:00:34.980> just<00:00:35.340> to<00:00:35.460> make<00:00:35.520> sure<00:00:35.880> that<00:00:36.120> I<00:00:36.180> was<00:00:36.390> I<00:00:36.630> was

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:37.410 
out just to make sure that I was I was

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:39.920 
out just to make sure that I was I was
cutting<00:00:37.800> into<00:00:38.100> the<00:00:38.850> existing<00:00:39.390> threads<00:00:39.719> and

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:39.930 
cutting into the existing threads and

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:41.900 
cutting into the existing threads and
not<00:00:40.110> cutting<00:00:40.500> over<00:00:40.680> the<00:00:40.860> threads<00:00:41.489> cuz<00:00:41.730> if<00:00:41.850> you

00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:41.910 
not cutting over the threads cuz if you

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:44.270 
not cutting over the threads cuz if you
cut<00:00:42.090> over<00:00:42.329> the<00:00:42.360> threads<00:00:42.920> then<00:00:43.920> you're<00:00:44.070> just

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:44.280 
cut over the threads then you're just

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:47.029 
cut over the threads then you're just
leaving<00:00:44.600> behind<00:00:45.600> what<00:00:46.530> your<00:00:46.649> bolt<00:00:46.860> left

00:00:47.029 --> 00:00:47.039 
leaving behind what your bolt left

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:48.740 
leaving behind what your bolt left
behind<00:00:47.370> and<00:00:47.610> you're<00:00:47.850> gonna<00:00:47.940> be<00:00:48.120> stuck<00:00:48.480> with<00:00:48.539> no

00:00:48.740 --> 00:00:48.750 
behind and you're gonna be stuck with no

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:50.990 
behind and you're gonna be stuck with no
threads<00:00:49.050> so<00:00:49.680> I<00:00:49.980> backed<00:00:50.309> it<00:00:50.460> out<00:00:50.550> and<00:00:50.789> I'm<00:00:50.879> all

00:00:50.990 --> 00:00:51.000 
threads so I backed it out and I'm all

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:52.459 
threads so I backed it out and I'm all
good<00:00:51.030> I'm<00:00:51.360> riding<00:00:51.660> in<00:00:51.750> the<00:00:51.809> right<00:00:51.960> groove<00:00:52.230> so<00:00:52.410> I

00:00:52.459 --> 00:00:52.469 
good I'm riding in the right groove so I

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:53.840 
good I'm riding in the right groove so I
already<00:00:52.710> tapped<00:00:52.920> these<00:00:53.129> ones<00:00:53.309> out<00:00:53.460> just<00:00:53.730> to

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:53.850 
already tapped these ones out just to

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:56.150 
already tapped these ones out just to
get<00:00:53.910> the<00:00:54.059> rust<00:00:54.210> and<00:00:54.449> scale<00:00:54.989> out<00:00:55.260> of<00:00:55.379> them<00:00:55.500> but

00:00:56.150 --> 00:00:56.160 
get the rust and scale out of them but

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:58.700 
get the rust and scale out of them but
this<00:00:56.309> one<00:00:56.489> I<00:00:56.520> got<00:00:56.730> to<00:00:56.820> tap<00:00:57.000> in<00:00:57.239> and<00:00:57.530> get<00:00:58.530> some

00:00:58.700 --> 00:00:58.710 
this one I got to tap in and get some

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:04.670 
this one I got to tap in and get some
threads<00:00:58.920> in<00:00:59.070> there<00:01:02.660> there<00:01:03.660> we<00:01:03.780> go<00:01:03.960> you<00:01:04.409> got<00:01:04.589> the

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:04.680 
threads in there there we go you got the

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:07.420 
threads in there there we go you got the
tab<00:01:04.920> bottomed<00:01:05.220> all<00:01:05.519> the<00:01:05.610> way<00:01:05.729> out<00:01:06.170> so<00:01:07.170> that's

00:01:07.420 --> 00:01:07.430 
tab bottomed all the way out so that's

00:01:07.430 --> 00:01:09.649 
tab bottomed all the way out so that's
gonna<00:01:08.430> have<00:01:08.640> a<00:01:08.700> nice<00:01:08.880> set<00:01:09.090> of<00:01:09.119> threads<00:01:09.390> in<00:01:09.540> it

00:01:09.649 --> 00:01:09.659 
gonna have a nice set of threads in it

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:13.300 
gonna have a nice set of threads in it
now<00:01:10.010> now<00:01:11.010> be<00:01:11.220> able<00:01:11.310> to<00:01:11.430> get<00:01:11.549> a<00:01:11.580> bolt<00:01:12.119> in<00:01:12.270> there

00:01:13.300 --> 00:01:13.310 
now now be able to get a bolt in there

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:15.859 
now now be able to get a bolt in there
that's<00:01:14.310> pretty<00:01:14.549> much<00:01:14.790> what<00:01:15.030> was<00:01:15.119> holding<00:01:15.750> me

tubes or whatever inside them they're
not<00:01:34.860> the<00:01:35.009> best<00:01:35.159> tires<00:01:35.460> but<00:01:35.700> I'm<00:01:35.820> not<00:01:35.939> really

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:36.090

00:01:40.730 --> 00:01:40.740 
but there it is that bolt threads in

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:43.100 
but there it is that bolt threads in
there<00:01:40.890> real<00:01:41.040> nice<00:01:41.250> so<00:01:42.180> we<00:01:42.360> got<00:01:42.479> three<00:01:42.689> bolts<00:01:42.990> in

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:43.110 
there real nice so we got three bolts in

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:44.539
