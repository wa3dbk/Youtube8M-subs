00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:23.070 
clicking it's pretty tough to do so you

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:24.920 
clicking it's pretty tough to do so you
can't<00:00:23.340> even<00:00:23.430> click<00:00:23.820> on<00:00:24.060> these<00:00:24.240> buttons

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:40.160 

and<00:01:37.520> this<00:01:38.520> one's<00:01:38.729> a<00:01:38.939> lot<00:01:39.090> much<00:01:39.270> better<00:01:39.659> to<00:01:39.930> work

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:40.170 
and this one's a lot much better to work

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:42.350 
and this one's a lot much better to work
with<00:01:40.409> so<00:01:41.070> we<00:01:41.250> want<00:01:41.430> to<00:01:41.520> select<00:01:41.700> couple<00:01:42.270> of

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:42.360 
with so we want to select couple of

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:44.209 
with so we want to select couple of
files<00:01:42.600> like<00:01:43.380> let's<00:01:43.649> say<00:01:43.710> you<00:01:43.829> want<00:01:43.979> to<00:01:44.009> delete

00:01:44.209 --> 00:01:44.219 
files like let's say you want to delete

00:01:44.219 --> 00:01:47.840 
files like let's say you want to delete
multiple<00:01:44.280> files<00:01:45.079> just<00:01:46.079> tab<00:01:46.590> on<00:01:46.799> this<00:01:46.979> ever<00:01:47.399> so

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:47.850 
multiple files just tab on this ever so

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:53.510 
multiple files just tab on this ever so
slightly<00:01:48.119> and<00:01:51.409> so<00:01:52.409> you<00:01:52.500> just<00:01:52.710> wipe<00:01:52.979> it<00:01:53.130> down<00:01:53.310> on

00:01:53.510 --> 00:01:53.520 
slightly and so you just wipe it down on

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:56.749 
slightly and so you just wipe it down on
the<00:01:53.610> on<00:01:54.299> the<00:01:54.360> file<00:01:54.750> or<00:01:54.960> folder<00:01:55.140> just<00:01:56.130> lightly

00:01:56.749 --> 00:01:56.759 
the on the file or folder just lightly

00:01:56.759 --> 00:01:58.609 
the on the file or folder just lightly
then<00:01:57.000> you<00:01:57.119> can<00:01:57.240> either<00:01:57.329> cut<00:01:57.630> copy<00:01:57.929> and<00:01:58.140> do<00:01:58.470> all

00:01:58.609 --> 00:01:58.619 
then you can either cut copy and do all

00:01:58.619 --> 00:02:01.550 
then you can either cut copy and do all
your<00:01:58.880> windows<00:01:59.880> thing<00:02:00.270> from<00:02:00.420> there<00:02:00.659> so<00:02:01.229> this<00:02:01.409> is

00:02:01.550 --> 00:02:01.560 
your windows thing from there so this is

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:03.050 
your windows thing from there so this is
really<00:02:01.710> convenient<00:02:02.100> if<00:02:02.520> you<00:02:02.610> don't<00:02:02.759> have<00:02:02.880> your

00:02:03.050 --> 00:02:03.060 
really convenient if you don't have your

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:04.940 
really convenient if you don't have your
keyboard<00:02:03.539> so<00:02:03.720> instead<00:02:03.929> of<00:02:04.020> control<00:02:04.350> x<00:02:04.560> control

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:04.950 
keyboard so instead of control x control

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:10.820 
keyboard so instead of control x control
be<00:02:05.069> and<00:02:05.220> all<00:02:05.340> that<00:02:05.929> okay<00:02:07.069> and<00:02:09.349> the<00:02:10.349> very<00:02:10.500> touch

00:02:10.820 --> 00:02:10.830 
be and all that okay and the very touch

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:12.800 
be and all that okay and the very touch
sensitive<00:02:10.860> you<00:02:11.459> got<00:02:11.580> bigger<00:02:11.910> icons<00:02:12.390> to<00:02:12.569> work

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:12.810 
sensitive you got bigger icons to work

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:15.309 
sensitive you got bigger icons to work
with<00:02:13.049> so<00:02:13.890> this<00:02:14.069> is<00:02:14.220> a<00:02:14.250> much<00:02:14.489> easier<00:02:14.519> way<00:02:14.910> to

00:02:15.309 --> 00:02:15.319 
with so this is a much easier way to

00:02:15.319 --> 00:02:17.479 
with so this is a much easier way to
navigate<00:02:16.319> through<00:02:16.830> all<00:02:16.950> your<00:02:17.069> files<00:02:17.310> and

00:02:17.479 --> 00:02:17.489 
navigate through all your files and

navigate through all your files and
folder<00:02:18.140> all<00:02:19.140> right<00:02:19.349> another<00:02:19.890> alternative<00:02:20.489> is

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:21.410 
folder all right another alternative is
