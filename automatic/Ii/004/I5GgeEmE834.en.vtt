00:00:06.250 --> 00:00:09.319
 welcome to the demonstration of another one 

00:00:09.319 --> 00:00:12.319
 I put it down again by clicking the icon 

00:00:12.999 --> 00:00:16.609
 then you get an overview of the weather now and the weather for the next five 

00:00:16.609 --> 00:00:17.480
 days 

00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:20.210
 the standard weather is Wagenborg newspaper 

00:00:20.210 --> 00:00:23.499
 so above you can see the current conditions for example is 7 degrees 

00:00:24.349 --> 00:00:28.909
 the humidity increased by 9 percent and the air pressure is that 18 the object as well 

00:00:28.909 --> 00:00:30.130
 like cabbage 

00:00:30.130 --> 00:00:33.200
 diaz you see the expectation of the coming hours going to be higher 

00:00:34.780 --> 00:00:37.700
 below is therefore to be blocked for the next five days 

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:40.300
 he sees the first three days at the far left 

00:00:40.300 --> 00:00:43.510
 in addition, study icons of how things are going to be largely for that day 

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:46.470
 next Saturday it will be rainy 

00:00:46.470 --> 00:00:49.470
 and Sunday is the much chance of sun in this case 

00:00:50.480 --> 00:00:53.380
 In addition, the temperature of the first 

00:00:53.380 --> 00:00:55.350
 the morning then 

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:56.850
 then the evening 

00:00:56.850 --> 00:00:59.870
 on Sundays, 12 degrees is welcome in the morning 

00:01:00.720 --> 00:01:04.010
 then it pours with 10 degrees some cooling in the afternoon 

00:01:04.010 --> 00:01:07.010
 and it becomes 8 degrees even cooler in the evening 

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:10.670
 in addition, of course, yellow and blue arches 

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:13.360
 those beams represent the sunny side 

00:01:13.360 --> 00:01:16.300
 or actually the clouds 

00:01:16.300 --> 00:01:19.300
 and the blue eyes represents the chance of rain 

00:01:19.990 --> 00:01:22.210
 as you can see is Sunday 

00:01:22.210 --> 00:01:23.350
 evening 

00:01:23.350 --> 00:01:25.530
 the gravel bin is very large 

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:28.819
 so that means that actually little is no cloud on it 

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:33.790
 there is working ship today also for the square that will generally be mollet or blowing 

00:01:33.790 --> 00:01:34.900
 to be 

00:01:34.900 --> 00:01:38.880
 Monday for example Monday afternoon because he is in the middle is the construction beam 

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:41.920
 very long so then it will probably be the same from day 9 

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:46.159
 compulsory military service as the last site 

00:01:46.159 --> 00:01:48.850
 and the win speed 

00:01:48.850 --> 00:01:51.850
 that's because 

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:56.010
 you see the pain was expected from pet end hour 

00:01:56.010 --> 00:01:58.160
 and it can take hours from the Netherlands 

00:01:58.160 --> 00:02:00.390
 you can just have a really nice summer 

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:03.390
 and see where the showers are 

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:06.600
 the one above shows the time of the smoke 

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:08.629
 what time the figurines 

00:02:08.629 --> 00:02:10.169
 then comes one 

00:02:10.169 --> 00:02:13.169
 that can differ see how know in the netherlands is 

00:02:13.749 --> 00:02:15.459
 oki can just zoom in 

00:02:15.459 --> 00:02:18.819
 do you want time above you 

00:02:18.819 --> 00:02:21.999
 for which the image money 

00:02:21.999 --> 00:02:24.999
 Finally, you can still place work that you don't want to see 

00:02:26.179 --> 00:02:28.170
 For example, you can go to a place that you pass by 

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:30.469
 a bit against the ropes 

00:02:30.469 --> 00:02:33.679
 and the rest one looks at you know for sure the place they owe 

00:02:33.679 --> 00:02:34.929
 16 years 

00:02:34.929 --> 00:02:37.929
 and place them away and you can also add a puddle 

00:02:39.819 --> 00:02:42.819
 a type 

00:02:45.319 --> 00:02:46.489
 speak main plate 

00:02:46.489 --> 00:02:47.749
 and it has been added 

00:02:47.749 --> 00:02:49.559
 you can therefore switch places 

00:02:49.559 --> 00:02:51.569
 because crystal bath entered 

00:02:51.569 --> 00:02:53.809
 we also need to pick up new ones 

00:02:53.809 --> 00:02:54.869
 that there are seven 

00:02:54.869 --> 00:02:58.019
 in trust equipment experienced black one below 

00:02:58.019 --> 00:02:59.959
 you can also select us 

00:02:59.959 --> 00:03:01.429
 what you want 

00:03:01.429 --> 00:03:04.010
 You can also view based on GPS 

00:03:04.010 --> 00:03:05.509
 ask the weather 

00:03:05.509 --> 00:03:09.119
 or also not placing by and at this fifth place 

00:03:09.119 --> 00:03:10.089
 letting go 

00:03:10.089 --> 00:03:12.549
 and before that it was picked up again 

00:03:12.549 --> 00:03:13.459
 thanks for attention
