00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:46.710 
category one maximum sustained winds

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:48.710 
category one maximum sustained winds
around<00:01:46.829> 85<00:01:47.310> miles<00:01:47.610> an<00:01:47.820> hour<00:01:47.939> but<00:01:48.210> at<00:01:48.360> his<00:01:48.479> peak

around 85 miles an hour but at his peak

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:50.389 
around 85 miles an hour but at his peak
we<00:01:48.869> expect<00:01:49.170> this<00:01:49.290> to<00:01:49.409> be<00:01:49.439> a<00:01:49.530> category<00:01:50.040> four

00:01:50.389 --> 00:01:50.399 
we expect this to be a category four

00:01:50.399 --> 00:01:51.950 
we expect this to be a category four
storm<00:01:50.729> and<00:01:51.180> it's<00:01:51.270> gonna<00:01:51.360> be<00:01:51.509> quite<00:01:51.720> powerful

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:51.960 
storm and it's gonna be quite powerful

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:54.770 
storm and it's gonna be quite powerful
indeed<00:01:52.860> now<00:01:53.070> I<00:01:53.130> did<00:01:53.369> mention<00:01:53.399> our<00:01:53.909> warnings

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:54.780 
indeed now I did mention our warnings

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:57.109 
indeed now I did mention our warnings
we're<00:01:54.930> looking<00:01:55.229> at<00:01:55.380> our<00:01:56.369> watches<00:01:56.549> in<00:01:56.850> morning

00:01:57.109 --> 00:01:57.119 
we're looking at our watches in morning

00:01:57.119 --> 00:01:59.060 
we're looking at our watches in morning

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:02.610 
tropical storm watch so we're talking

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:04.670 
tropical storm watch so we're talking
about<00:02:02.880> the<00:02:03.000> southeastern<00:02:03.600> Bahamas<00:02:04.020> certainly

about the southeastern Bahamas certainly
going<00:02:04.799> to<00:02:04.860> be<00:02:04.920> active<00:02:05.340> indeed<00:02:05.729> this<00:02:06.149> is<00:02:06.270> a

00:02:06.319 --> 00:02:06.329 
going to be active indeed this is a

00:02:06.329 --> 00:02:08.600 
going to be active indeed this is a

powerful system that bears watching we

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:10.790 
powerful system that bears watching we

really<00:02:13.460> tearing<00:02:13.760> that<00:02:13.880> system<00:02:14.300> apart<00:02:14.570> Earl<00:02:15.110> is

00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:15.530 
really tearing that system apart Earl is

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:17.860 
really tearing that system apart Earl is
the<00:02:15.950> highlight<00:02:16.550> of<00:02:16.610> the<00:02:16.850> Atlantic<00:02:17.240> Basin<00:02:17.390> but

turning this into a named tropical
system<00:02:31.910> as<00:02:32.060> well<00:02:32.330> but<00:02:32.450> at<00:02:32.570> this<00:02:32.690> point<00:02:32.840> it

00:02:33.010 --> 00:02:33.020 
system as well but at this point it

00:02:33.020 --> 00:02:34.150 
system as well but at this point it
doesn't<00:02:33.200> look<00:02:33.410> like<00:02:33.620> it's<00:02:33.770> going<00:02:33.800> to<00:02:33.950> be<00:02:34.010> as

tropics are indeed active we'll see a

00:02:39.380 --> 00:02:40.810 
tropics are indeed active we'll see a

00:02:40.810 --> 00:02:40.820 
lot of activity over the next coming

00:02:40.820 --> 00:02:44.020 
lot of activity over the next coming
days<00:02:41.350> and<00:02:42.350> weeks<00:02:42.410> this<00:02:43.370> is<00:02:43.610> the<00:02:43.760> peak<00:02:43.910> of

00:02:44.020 --> 00:02:44.030 
days and weeks this is the peak of

00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:48.520 
hurricane season august and sep tember
know<00:02:47.090> people<00:02:47.450> have<00:02:47.540> been<00:02:47.660> saying<00:02:47.870> well<00:02:48.170> where

00:02:48.520 --> 00:02:48.530 
know people have been saying well where

00:02:48.530 --> 00:02:49.840 
know people have been saying well where
are<00:02:48.709> the<00:02:48.830> hurricanes<00:02:49.280> we<00:02:49.400> were<00:02:49.459> talking<00:02:49.760> about

00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:49.850 
are the hurricanes we were talking about

00:02:49.850 --> 00:02:52.449 
are the hurricanes we were talking about
an<00:02:50.030> act<00:02:50.239> of<00:02:50.390> hurricane<00:02:50.780> season<00:02:50.989> june<00:02:51.920> july

00:02:52.449 --> 00:02:52.459 
an act of hurricane season june july

00:02:52.459 --> 00:02:54.790 
an act of hurricane season june july
that's<00:02:53.390> not<00:02:53.660> the<00:02:53.780> peak<00:02:53.959> of<00:02:54.050> the<00:02:54.170> season<00:02:54.320> things

00:02:54.790 --> 00:02:54.800 
that's not the peak of the season things

00:02:54.800 --> 00:02:57.220 
that's not the peak of the season things
tend<00:02:55.190> to<00:02:55.310> be<00:02:55.430> slow<00:02:55.640> there<00:02:55.940> now<00:02:56.390> we're<00:02:56.959> indeed

00:02:57.220 --> 00:02:57.230 
tend to be slow there now we're indeed

00:02:57.230 --> 00:02:59.440 
tend to be slow there now we're indeed
picking<00:02:57.650> up<00:02:57.800> some<00:02:58.190> of<00:02:58.310> the<00:02:58.370> activity<00:02:58.910> so<00:02:59.150> let's

00:02:59.440 --> 00:02:59.450 
picking up some of the activity so let's

00:02:59.450 --> 00:03:01.900 
picking up some of the activity so let's
focus<00:02:59.840> in<00:02:59.989> on<00:03:00.230> Earl<00:03:00.890> once<00:03:01.250> again<00:03:01.610> right<00:03:01.880> now

00:03:01.900 --> 00:03:01.910 
focus in on Earl once again right now

00:03:01.910 --> 00:03:03.699 
focus in on Earl once again right now
we're<00:03:02.330> looking<00:03:02.420> at<00:03:02.600> Earl<00:03:02.840> that's<00:03:03.110> set<00:03:03.380> just<00:03:03.590> to

00:03:03.699 --> 00:03:03.709 
we're looking at Earl that's set just to

00:03:03.709 --> 00:03:05.260 
we're looking at Earl that's set just to
the<00:03:03.860> north<00:03:04.070> the<00:03:04.160> center<00:03:04.550> of<00:03:04.580> the<00:03:04.700> circulation

00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:05.270 
the north the center of the circulation

00:03:05.270 --> 00:03:08.020 
the north the center of the circulation
is<00:03:05.420> just<00:03:05.900> to<00:03:05.989> the<00:03:06.110> north<00:03:06.320> of<00:03:06.760> Antigua<00:03:07.760> we<00:03:07.880> can

00:03:08.020 --> 00:03:08.030 
is just to the north of Antigua we can

00:03:08.030 --> 00:03:10.449 
is just to the north of Antigua we can
switch<00:03:08.239> over<00:03:08.540> to<00:03:08.570> our<00:03:08.720> live<00:03:09.050> vipir<00:03:09.290> 5<00:03:09.620> HD<00:03:10.040> where

switch over to our live vipir 5 HD where

00:03:10.459 --> 00:03:12.880 
switch over to our live vipir 5 HD where
I<00:03:10.489> have<00:03:10.730> plotted<00:03:11.060> the<00:03:11.720> individual<00:03:12.500> model

00:03:12.880 --> 00:03:12.890 
I have plotted the individual model

00:03:12.890 --> 00:03:14.470
