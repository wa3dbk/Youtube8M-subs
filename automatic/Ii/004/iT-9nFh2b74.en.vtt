 electronic arts has developed the 

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:18.090
 launched caixa the second of 

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:20.250
 the five expansions planned for the 

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:22.290
 successful padel phil 4 which had already 

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:24.450
 seen the light as exclusive temporary in 

00:00:22.290 --> 00:00:26.220
 xbox one and that the end we can download 

00:00:24.450 --> 00:00:29.090
 in the rest of the platforms of the 

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:29.090
 game is available 

00:00:35.230 --> 00:00:40.100
 specifically this dlc includes new 

00:00:38.059 --> 00:00:42.290
 maps for online multiplayer modes 

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:43.910
 being nothing less than the four 

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:45.290
 favorite scenarios of the previous 

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:47.030
 battlefield 3 that have now been 

00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:49.100
 adapted for this new delivery to 

00:00:47.030 --> 00:00:51.170
 field or received each one of them as 

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:53.269
 is to imagine the corresponding wash 

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:55.250
 face thanks to the graphic potential of 

00:00:53.269 --> 00:00:57.379
 frostbite 3 to which we must add a 

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:59.360
 greater interactivity and possibilities 

00:00:57.379 --> 00:01:02.379
 of increased destruction offered by the 

00:00:59.360 --> 00:01:02.379
 evolution system 

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:11.909
 more exactly the four maps 

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:13.680
 included in the expansion are borders 

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:15.659
 of the operation castle for this 

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:17.700
 gulf of oman and metro operation 

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:20.420
 detailing the following ones of 

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:20.420
 more detailed form 

00:01:25.300 --> 00:01:29.050
 starting Caspian border 

00:01:27.490 --> 00:01:31.150
 it's about a pretty broad map and 

00:01:29.050 --> 00:01:32.920
 open with a forest ambience that 

00:01:31.150 --> 00:01:34.570
 characterized by a huge tower of 

00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:36.160
 communication that in mattel filtre 

00:01:34.570 --> 00:01:37.990
 it was always destroyed in a way 

00:01:36.160 --> 00:01:40.590
 automatic when the game was at 

00:01:37.990 --> 00:01:40.590
 end point 

00:01:46.730 --> 00:01:50.120
 although in this new version of the map 

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:51.770
 that has changed since said 

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:53.240
 destruction is now attached to a 

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:55.550
 computer with a countdown 

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:57.500
 allowing players to stop the 

00:01:55.550 --> 00:01:59.450
 timer or on the contrary let 

00:01:57.500 --> 00:02:01.340
 that it reaches zero when the 

00:01:59.450 --> 00:02:03.530
 tower will fall spectacularly devastating 

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:04.940
 a part of the map while forming 

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:08.920
 a new path in the middle of the 

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:08.920
 debris through which we can descend 

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:30.420
 on the other hand operation and failures all month 

00:02:28.769 --> 00:02:32.310
 also an open map and large 

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:34.769
 dimensions where a large 

00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:36.659
 oil refinery and while this was 

00:02:34.769 --> 00:02:38.849
 something anecdotic in battlefield 3 now 

00:02:36.659 --> 00:02:40.200
 will play a more important role 

00:02:38.849 --> 00:02:42.709
 that many elements have been added 

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:42.709
 flammable 

00:02:45.770 --> 00:02:49.940
 you can send for example the puddles 

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:51.950
 of oil in the ground or do what 

00:02:49.940 --> 00:02:53.960
 own with the gas pipes what gives 

00:02:51.950 --> 00:02:55.730
 As a result, a lot of atmosphere 

00:02:53.960 --> 00:02:57.350
 more realistic according to what would be 

00:02:55.730 --> 00:03:00.190
 wait for a scenario of these 

00:02:57.350 --> 00:03:00.190
 characteristics 

00:03:07.760 --> 00:03:11.689
 going to the Gulf of Oman is undoubtedly one 

00:03:10.099 --> 00:03:13.849
 of the most popular and popular maps 

00:03:11.689 --> 00:03:15.680
 of the saga which has already become 

00:03:13.849 --> 00:03:18.129
 in a classic since debuted on 

00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:18.129
 battlefield 

00:03:18.850 --> 00:03:21.090
 here 

00:03:22.830 --> 00:03:27.220
 it is a great coastal scenario 

00:03:25.570 --> 00:03:29.320
 size in which one of the sides 

00:03:27.220 --> 00:03:30.700
 starts from an aircraft carrier while 

00:03:29.320 --> 00:03:32.800
 that the other does it from the mainland 

00:03:30.700 --> 00:03:35.110
 being the novelty in this new version 

00:03:32.800 --> 00:03:36.790
 for battlefield 4 which now according to 

00:03:35.110 --> 00:03:38.830
 is advancing the game a great 

00:03:36.790 --> 00:03:40.870
 sandstorm will affect more and more 

00:03:38.830 --> 00:03:44.790
 to our visibility to the point of 

00:03:40.870 --> 00:03:44.790
 that we can hardly see with reality 

00:03:45.510 --> 00:03:49.409
 this will be reinforced by a strong 

00:03:47.760 --> 00:03:51.390
 wind that will increase 

00:03:49.409 --> 00:03:53.159
 that our strategy has to go little 

00:03:51.390 --> 00:03:55.549
 little by adapting to it during the 

00:03:53.159 --> 00:03:55.549
 battle 

00:03:58.990 --> 00:04:02.890
 and finally the fourth map is your 

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:04.870
 metro operation for many one of the 

00:04:02.890 --> 00:04:06.850
 best maps of the whole saga for its 

00:04:04.870 --> 00:04:08.800
 clearly action-oriented design 

00:04:06.850 --> 00:04:11.050
 direct being unlike others 

00:04:08.800 --> 00:04:12.910
 scenarios included in this expansion 

00:04:11.050 --> 00:04:14.500
 an urban map in which the 

00:04:12.910 --> 00:04:16.720
 infantry monopolizes all the protagonism 

00:04:14.500 --> 00:04:19.890
 so it's the only one where there's no 

00:04:16.720 --> 00:04:19.890
 vehicles to drive 

00:04:24.200 --> 00:04:27.950
 specifically this map places us in the 

00:04:26.240 --> 00:04:29.510
 city ​​of paris being the stage 

00:04:27.950 --> 00:04:31.730
 composed of three sectors well 

00:04:29.510 --> 00:04:33.560
 differentiated some parties are all 

00:04:31.730 --> 00:04:35.450
 of buildings and in between both the 

00:04:33.560 --> 00:04:37.070
 inside the metro being precisely 

00:04:35.450 --> 00:04:39.470
 here where the 

00:04:37.070 --> 00:04:41.480
 more intense confrontations abound 

00:04:39.470 --> 00:04:43.160
 the narrow corridors what propitiates 

00:04:41.480 --> 00:04:46.330
 we always find ourselves with 

00:04:43.160 --> 00:04:46.330
 enemy face to face 

00:04:48.070 --> 00:04:51.670
 as a main novelty this new 

00:04:49.990 --> 00:04:53.980
 version presents the one that now some 

00:04:51.670 --> 00:04:56.080
 tunnels will be flooded with water watching 

00:04:53.980 --> 00:04:58.000
 also new alternative paths for 

00:04:56.080 --> 00:04:59.560
 leave the metro with the possibility of 

00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:01.300
 set fire to the grass and shoot 

00:04:59.560 --> 00:05:03.100
 wooden planks to make fall 

00:05:01.300 --> 00:05:05.340
 parts of the metro roof over the 

00:05:03.100 --> 00:05:05.340
 enemies 

00:05:10.300 --> 00:05:14.289
 for the rest we emphasize that that with 

00:05:12.250 --> 00:05:16.060
 roasted that includes five new weapons a 

00:05:14.289 --> 00:05:17.979
 new vehicle to drive which 

00:05:16.060 --> 00:05:20.289
 He has also been rescued from the previous 

00:05:17.979 --> 00:05:22.360
 battle filtres in the case of the buggy 

00:05:20.289 --> 00:05:24.430
 desert resulting this ideal for 

00:05:22.360 --> 00:05:27.370
 move them very quickly through the field 

00:05:24.430 --> 00:05:28.990
 battle though that's not all because 

00:05:27.370 --> 00:05:31.150
 a new mode of 

00:05:28.990 --> 00:05:33.220
 that play capture the flag being 

00:05:31.150 --> 00:05:35.169
 This is a modality that was also 

00:05:33.220 --> 00:05:37.539
 present in easy filters whose mechanics 

00:05:35.169 --> 00:05:39.280
 as most of you know, it consists of 

00:05:37.539 --> 00:05:40.629
 steal the enemy flag and take it 

00:05:39.280 --> 00:05:44.280
 to our base while 

00:05:40.629 --> 00:05:44.280
 we defend our own flag 

00:05:49.669 --> 00:05:54.329
 In short we have to confess that no 

00:05:52.259 --> 00:05:56.339
 we were sure of whether to recover four 

00:05:54.329 --> 00:05:57.959
 maps of the previous easy that the 3 would be 

00:05:56.339 --> 00:05:59.759
 an idea right since this we 

00:05:57.959 --> 00:06:01.409
 transmitted a priori the sensation of 

00:05:59.759 --> 00:06:03.419
 be paying for content that 

00:06:01.409 --> 00:06:06.589
 it had simply been recycled but not 

00:06:03.419 --> 00:06:06.589
 for something really new 

00:06:06.900 --> 00:06:11.070
 however, seeing the redesign to which 

00:06:09.030 --> 00:06:12.570
 these scenarios have been submitted and 

00:06:11.070 --> 00:06:14.610
 especially the use of 

00:06:12.570 --> 00:06:16.410
 evolution system to equip them with 

00:06:14.610 --> 00:06:18.270
 greater interactivity and level of 

00:06:16.410 --> 00:06:20.310
 destruction we have been quite 

00:06:18.270 --> 00:06:22.050
 satisfied being a dlc with the 

00:06:20.310 --> 00:06:23.789
 Enough attractive to like 

00:06:22.050 --> 00:06:27.080
 Any fan who wants to expand even more 

00:06:23.789 --> 00:06:27.080
 the fun of the game 

00:06:27.210 --> 00:06:32.009
 we remind you that for 34 this hunter 

00:06:29.819 --> 00:06:33.720

00:06:33.720 --> 00:06:37.199
 acquired the premium subscription 

00:06:35.490 --> 00:06:41.660
 while the price for the rest of 

00:06:37.199 --> 00:06:41.660
 players of this 14 with 99 euros
