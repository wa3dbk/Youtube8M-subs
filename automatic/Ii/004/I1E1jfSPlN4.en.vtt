00:00:01.509 --> 00:00:05.259
 May I introduce the system is the hero of the ambulance Breaks that is 

00:00:05.259 --> 00:00:09.060
 in the search of a princess for his princess, mind you and for that 

00:00:09.059 --> 00:00:11.930
 The little fellow enters the world in a magical two as we do her 

00:00:11.930 --> 00:00:14.930
 see a cheap Melle seems to have sprung 

00:00:16.129 --> 00:00:19.800
 the 40 to the point of painting hard after classics like Super Mario 

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:20.620
 Land gave 

00:00:20.620 --> 00:00:25.090
 In fact, Brett also seems to do so at the beginning 

00:00:25.090 --> 00:00:26.090
 with key 

00:00:26.090 --> 00:00:30.970
 Climbing ladders in 4 opens doors all with the aim of sharing customers like 

00:00:30.970 --> 00:00:34.800
 to gather this together with millennium and 

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:37.800
 Percent of the low-level flight unlock 

00:00:38.320 --> 00:00:41.220
 Oh yes, and of course, the compulsory conclusion of each may 

00:00:41.220 --> 00:00:44.220
 Section together with saying one better is not missing 

00:00:47.480 --> 00:00:50.740
 But Break is far more than a sleazy Mario clone can dampen 

00:00:50.740 --> 00:00:53.609
 much like the prince from Persia manipulate time 

00:00:53.609 --> 00:00:57.050
 the game beats a lot more imaginative as well as amazingly plausible 

00:00:57.049 --> 00:01:00.819
 Riddle is here to get a key happy in the pit smoothness 

00:01:00.819 --> 00:01:04.049
 the enemy Unspunnen no longer 20 together with the key back to the 

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:07.049
 surface 

00:01:13.090 --> 00:01:16.030
 Of course, it does not stay that easy in the course they have to, for example 

00:01:16.030 --> 00:01:19.340
 Pay attention that green shimmering objects like the platform and not from 

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:21.450
 currently allow manipulation to impress 

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:24.270
 So they follow their normal pattern of movement when they do 

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:27.270
 Press the Tour button 

00:01:34.730 --> 00:01:38.170
 3 

00:01:38.170 --> 00:01:41.420
 In the course of the game the wackier so moves in the fourth of six 

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:45.049
 Puppies only then forward if Tim does that too, match that track 

00:01:45.049 --> 00:01:48.070
 Program everything back when I move backwards even the music 

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:55.140
 Through this trick Las fine keys for me to get 

00:01:56.390 --> 00:01:59.390
 or maneuvered them through gluttonous plants 

00:02:00.330 --> 00:02:03.740
 occasionally it even comes down to clever timing like here where the 

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:06.800
 Platform has to move through the us movement at the right moment 

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:08.810
 time-independent when green shining a lot 

00:02:08.810 --> 00:02:10.729
 to lead up to the key 

00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:12.939
 still wacky dangerous okay 

00:02:12.939 --> 00:02:16.199
 in the five trends, therefore, double-coil action of its shadow 

00:02:16.199 --> 00:02:19.070
 which then repeats all previously performed actions 

00:02:19.070 --> 00:02:22.450
 in this case, I let this switch of teams re-press with it 

00:02:22.450 --> 00:02:25.450
 I can slip in time through the only briefly opened gate 

00:02:33.579 --> 00:02:36.999
 in Wels six wins against put my rain in its environment 

00:02:36.999 --> 00:02:39.359
 everything slows down 

00:02:39.359 --> 00:02:42.739
 receipt 

00:02:42.739 --> 00:02:45.950
 everything runs backwards among the finalists and left the two 

00:02:45.950 --> 00:02:48.249
 Game action all calls to expire 

00:02:48.249 --> 00:02:52.049
 that's how it goes with me, but that's exactly what makes the attraction off the board 

00:02:56.259 --> 00:02:59.209
 By the way, there are two post offices, of course, there is also a role here 

00:02:59.209 --> 00:03:02.209
 when they manipulate the time 

00:03:03.299 --> 00:03:04.499
 beautiful 

00:03:04.499 --> 00:03:07.609
 and who does everything right lands in a thrilling finale in its course 

00:03:07.609 --> 00:03:09.659
 the origin of the story is devalued 

00:03:09.659 --> 00:03:13.379
 where history is such a sticking point of the world because everything they do 

00:03:13.379 --> 00:03:16.769
 to see from it intermediate tones text panels 

00:03:16.769 --> 00:03:21.530
 but that hardly bothers if the heart of Brett still motivate the puzzles anyway 

00:03:21.529 --> 00:03:25.609
 they now rewind broken clavicle repair their shadow 

00:03:25.609 --> 00:03:27.829
 Pozzo let part of the lonely 

00:03:27.829 --> 00:03:30.829
 or even the weather just manipulate 

00:03:33.849 --> 00:03:35.929
 Red 

00:03:35.929 --> 00:03:39.969
 Brake this inconspicuous independent gem is a little masterpiece 

00:03:39.969 --> 00:03:43.259
 become because the million-dollar blockmaster production in his 

00:03:43.259 --> 00:03:44.410
 Boundaries 

00:03:44.410 --> 00:03:45.139
 Why 

00:03:45.139 --> 00:03:48.169
 Now much more emphasis on thoughtful game design 

00:03:48.169 --> 00:03:52.759
 and loving doctors as big names and with two three four or five 

00:03:52.759 --> 00:03:54.109
 Winters title 

00:03:54.109 --> 00:03:57.469
 They both look at each other, they will not regret it, especially because of that 

00:03:57.469 --> 00:03:59.269
 small program only costs 13 euros
