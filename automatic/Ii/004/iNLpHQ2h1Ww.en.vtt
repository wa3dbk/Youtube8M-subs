00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.360
 gender equity is our first 

00:00:01.800 --> 00:00:05.339
 today's story because many 

00:00:03.360 --> 00:00:07.140
 educational institutions with support 

00:00:05.339 --> 00:00:09.690
 of the education ministry are 

00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:11.670
 developing initiatives to build 

00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:13.530
 equitable relationships between men and 

00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:15.599
 women from their differences 

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:18.150
 we discovered one of those projects is 

00:00:15.599 --> 00:00:19.710
 called coeducation and is based on the 

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:22.020
 principle of equality between the sexes 

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:24.210
 and non- discrimination between genders 

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:25.980
 in the classrooms today we are going to 

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:28.080
 know as in a school in Bogota 

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:29.820
 after a thorough investigation it 

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:31.470
 implements this methodology to improve 

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:33.120
 coexistence and performance 

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:35.690
 academic of boys and girls 

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:37.780
 let's see how it works 

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:37.780
 to 

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:53.149
 coeducation is a bet one 

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:56.850
 perspective for education that 

00:00:53.149 --> 00:00:58.949
 facilitates and favors teaching 

00:00:56.850 --> 00:01:02.010
 curricular processes so 

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:04.470
 differential let's say it's not enough that 

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:07.200
 visibly see that they and them 

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:09.390
 they are together sharing space 

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:12.240
 it required an intentional action that 

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:14.040
 let me see how they think what 

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:16.500
 perceptions have them how are they 

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:17.899
 learning from them and them and starting 

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:20.009
 of that then being able to do the work 

00:01:17.899 --> 00:01:23.360
 separate them into groups we were going to 

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:26.940
 facilitate that possibility of identifying 

00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:28.320
 these actions and these these modes of 

00:01:26.940 --> 00:01:30.060
 thought let's say both the 

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:32.300
 cognitive abilities as affective in 

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:32.300
 they 

00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:39.070
 and workshops on gender equality 

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:41.170
 are differentiated according to the 

00:01:39.070 --> 00:01:44.369
 ages and school grades from sixth to 

00:01:41.170 --> 00:01:47.080
 ninth with the 6th boys we started 

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:48.759
 with the self-recognition of their own 

00:01:47.080 --> 00:01:50.470
 body who they like 

00:01:48.759 --> 00:01:54.159
 them where their story comes from 

00:01:50.470 --> 00:01:58.799
 family in the education workshops of 

00:01:54.159 --> 00:02:01.370
 gender equality we learn to respect 

00:01:58.799 --> 00:02:03.330
 we learn to value 

00:02:01.370 --> 00:02:05.400
 already 

00:02:03.330 --> 00:02:08.550
 I think it's a very good teaching 

00:02:05.400 --> 00:02:11.220
 for the future we learn how it is 

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:15.840
 our body how to take care of it 

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:17.430
 as how is it also developed 

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:20.580
 it seems that men are very 

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:22.410
 sexist with women and we believe that 

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:25.590
 we have more right but that is not 

00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:29.250
 right then with that class 

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:30.780
 we learn to say that we have the 

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:33.330
 same rights as women who 

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:36.120
 none is better than the other then in 

00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:37.890
 I think this workshop is very good when 

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:39.720
 we are in say and we return to 

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:42.209
 find and I think it's going to be better 

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:44.640
 because we're going to be more mature we're going 

00:02:42.209 --> 00:02:47.190
 already not having as much disorder as we were 

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:50.280
 in fifth but as we say we do not go back 

00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:53.040
 to join the speeches it seems that they speak 

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:55.260
 much better in the eighth and 

00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:57.870
 ninth the center of work is project 

00:02:55.260 --> 00:03:01.370
 of life and the work of education of 

00:02:57.870 --> 00:03:04.800
 gender equality is centered on 

00:03:01.370 --> 00:03:06.780
 recognize the other or the other 

00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:08.060
 as much in certain things but 

00:03:06.780 --> 00:03:10.400
 also different 

00:03:08.060 --> 00:03:12.590
 in new thinking of perceiving the world 

00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:14.420
 to guide his life because we were 

00:03:12.590 --> 00:03:16.400
 doing a project activity in 

00:03:14.420 --> 00:03:19.040
 equality where we were doing in the 

00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:21.440
 billboards where women are 

00:03:19.040 --> 00:03:22.880
 making a silhouette of men and 

00:03:21.440 --> 00:03:24.920
 we men are doing 

00:03:22.880 --> 00:03:27.380
 a silhouette of women 

00:03:24.920 --> 00:03:29.750
 where we believe that what they think 

00:03:27.380 --> 00:03:31.970
 what they do and all the activities 

00:03:29.750 --> 00:03:33.200
 that they do in these workshops 

00:03:31.970 --> 00:03:35.599
 looking for gender equality 

00:03:33.200 --> 00:03:38.090
 we learn to love ourselves 

00:03:35.599 --> 00:03:40.610
 to respect others not to discriminate 

00:03:38.090 --> 00:03:42.200
 and accept us as we are 

00:03:40.610 --> 00:03:44.620
 same for that reason because we are 

00:03:42.200 --> 00:03:47.709
 humans are 

00:03:44.620 --> 00:03:50.650
 we all belong to a society but 

00:03:47.709 --> 00:03:53.080
 we are different because it is some we think 

00:03:50.650 --> 00:03:54.220
 in a way or we think of ourselves as 

00:03:53.080 --> 00:03:56.290
 men and women I think like 

00:03:54.220 --> 00:03:58.540
 women I think it's good more for 

00:03:56.290 --> 00:04:01.269
 because women understand more and for 

00:03:58.540 --> 00:04:03.159
 what some girls are very shy about 

00:04:01.269 --> 00:04:04.659
 talk to the boys for mocking and 

00:04:03.159 --> 00:04:07.750
 either by balloons or by doing them 

00:04:04.659 --> 00:04:09.760
 ugly things then when we're between 

00:04:07.750 --> 00:04:13.019
 girls we understand each other and we make 

00:04:09.760 --> 00:04:15.519
 learn better and the profit is 

00:04:13.019 --> 00:04:17.590
 precisely in what the teacher achieves 

00:04:15.519 --> 00:04:22.000
 discover in your practice to prepare 

00:04:17.590 --> 00:04:25.389
 better your classes to consider certain 

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:28.690
 materials in preference to them or 

00:04:25.389 --> 00:04:29.680
 for that in math class 

00:04:28.690 --> 00:04:32.199
 it can not be the same kind of 

00:04:29.680 --> 00:04:34.330
 math for some children prepared 

00:04:32.199 --> 00:04:36.580
 girls despite the fact that the themes 

00:04:34.330 --> 00:04:38.790
 because they are exactly the same is not 

00:04:36.580 --> 00:04:42.210
 the same because 

00:04:38.790 --> 00:04:44.040
 scientifically it has been proven that 

00:04:42.210 --> 00:04:45.720
 minds of boys and girls do not 

00:04:44.040 --> 00:04:48.870
 they are the same 

00:04:45.720 --> 00:04:52.440
 everyone has different process of 

00:04:48.870 --> 00:04:55.230
 development and when one prepares his class 

00:04:52.440 --> 00:04:58.170
 must take into account those differences 

00:04:55.230 --> 00:05:00.120
 that exist between the two therefore 

00:04:58.170 --> 00:05:01.410
 the strategies that are used for a 

00:05:00.120 --> 00:05:03.780
 group for the other have to be 

00:05:01.410 --> 00:05:06.960
 different the project has taught us to 

00:05:03.780 --> 00:05:08.610
 us to really establish what 

00:05:06.960 --> 00:05:10.980
 are the differences to read quite 

00:05:08.610 --> 00:05:13.170
 about the studies that have been done 

00:05:10.980 --> 00:05:15.480
 about the characteristics of children and 

00:05:13.170 --> 00:05:17.610
 of the girls about how the process of 

00:05:15.480 --> 00:05:19.530
 learning in them and that implies that 

00:05:17.610 --> 00:05:21.510
 we plan strategies 

00:05:19.530 --> 00:05:23.900
 different didactics for each of 

00:05:21.510 --> 00:05:23.900
 the groups
