00:01:56.880 --> 00:01:58.730

00:01:58.730 --> 00:01:58.740 
harder time multitasking in a busy world

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:00.530

it's<00:01:59.040> easier<00:01:59.399> to<00:01:59.640> observe<00:01:59.939> a<00:02:00.119> moving<00:02:00.420> object

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:00.540 
it's easier to observe a moving object

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:02.810 
it's easier to observe a moving object
when<00:02:00.960> your<00:02:01.079> head<00:02:01.259> is<00:02:01.469> still<00:02:01.619> so<00:02:02.130> when<00:02:02.399> a<00:02:02.430> pigeon

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:02.820 
when your head is still so when a pigeon

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:04.999 
when your head is still so when a pigeon
Bob's<00:02:03.030> its<00:02:03.299> head<00:02:03.600> it's<00:02:03.869> actually<00:02:04.439> holding<00:02:04.680> its

00:02:04.999 --> 00:02:05.009 
Bob's its head it's actually holding its

00:02:05.009 --> 00:02:07.340 
Bob's its head it's actually holding its
head<00:02:05.189> in<00:02:05.369> place<00:02:05.520> temporarily<00:02:06.149> while<00:02:06.780> its<00:02:07.020> body

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:07.350 
head in place temporarily while its body

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:09.979 
head in place temporarily while its body
moves<00:02:07.799> and<00:02:08.220> then<00:02:08.610> thrusts<00:02:09.270> its<00:02:09.450> head<00:02:09.569> forward

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:09.989 
moves and then thrusts its head forward

00:02:09.989 --> 00:02:12.350 
moves and then thrusts its head forward
again<00:02:10.259> this<00:02:10.590> keeps<00:02:10.979> the<00:02:11.160> head<00:02:11.340> stable<00:02:11.910> for<00:02:12.180> as

00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:12.360 
again this keeps the head stable for as

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:13.520 
again this keeps the head stable for as
long<00:02:12.569> as<00:02:12.629> possible

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:13.530 
long as possible

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:13.830 
long as possible
so

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:13.840 
so

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:15.690 
so
pigeon<00:02:14.170> can<00:02:14.410> keep<00:02:14.590> an<00:02:14.709> eye<00:02:14.800> out<00:02:14.830> for<00:02:15.040> squirmy

backstrom<00:03:36.730> got<00:03:36.880> the<00:03:36.970> idea<00:03:37.239> that<00:03:37.269> the<00:03:37.450> birds

00:03:37.650 --> 00:03:37.660 
backstrom got the idea that the birds

00:03:37.660 --> 00:03:39.420 
backstrom got the idea that the birds
used<00:03:37.900> sound<00:03:38.200> frequencies<00:03:38.739> when<00:03:38.950> he<00:03:39.099> noticed

00:03:39.420 --> 00:03:39.430 
used sound frequencies when he noticed

00:03:39.430 --> 00:03:41.460 
used sound frequencies when he noticed
raising<00:03:39.819> pigeons<00:03:40.030> going<00:03:40.750> astray

00:03:41.460 --> 00:03:41.470 
raising pigeons going astray

00:03:41.470 --> 00:03:43.409 
raising pigeons going astray
whenever<00:03:41.829> the<00:03:41.980> supersonic<00:03:42.549> Concorde<00:03:42.790> jet<00:03:43.090> was

00:03:43.409 --> 00:03:43.419 
whenever the supersonic Concorde jet was

00:03:43.419 --> 00:03:45.270 
whenever the supersonic Concorde jet was
flying<00:03:43.450> nearby<00:03:43.989> the<00:03:44.470> Jets<00:03:44.769> sonic

00:03:45.270 --> 00:03:45.280 
flying nearby the Jets sonic

00:03:45.280 --> 00:03:47.220 
flying nearby the Jets sonic
interference<00:03:45.549> was<00:03:46.150> disorienting<00:03:47.109> the

00:03:47.220 --> 00:03:47.230 
interference was disorienting the

00:03:47.230 --> 00:03:49.110 
interference was disorienting the
pigeons<00:03:47.709> weather<00:03:48.250> landscape<00:03:48.940> and

00:03:49.110 --> 00:03:49.120 
pigeons weather landscape and

00:03:49.120 --> 00:03:50.940 
pigeons weather landscape and
atmospheric<00:03:49.720> changes<00:03:50.169> can<00:03:50.349> also<00:03:50.380> lead<00:03:50.829> the

00:03:50.940 --> 00:03:50.950 
atmospheric changes can also lead the

00:03:50.950 --> 00:03:53.940 
atmospheric changes can also lead the
birds<00:03:51.160> astray<00:03:51.609> so<00:03:51.940> yeah<00:03:52.239> pigeons<00:03:52.900> turns<00:03:53.739> out

00:03:53.940 --> 00:03:53.950 
birds astray so yeah pigeons turns out

00:03:53.950 --> 00:03:56.400 
birds astray so yeah pigeons turns out
they're<00:03:54.160> pretty<00:03:54.400> rads<00:03:54.760> be<00:03:55.389> nice<00:03:55.599> and<00:03:56.019> thanks

00:03:56.400 --> 00:03:56.410 
they're pretty rads be nice and thanks
