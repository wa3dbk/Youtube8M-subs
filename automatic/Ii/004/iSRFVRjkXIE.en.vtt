optimal for season tire actually need

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:47.539 
optimal for season tire actually need
this<00:01:44.130> kind<00:01:44.340> of<00:01:44.460> requirement<00:01:46.040> maybe<00:01:47.040> just

00:01:47.539 --> 00:01:47.549 
this kind of requirement maybe just

00:01:47.549 --> 00:01:49.700 
this kind of requirement maybe just
because<00:01:47.700> it<00:01:47.939> Canada<00:01:48.210> has<00:01:48.420> more<00:01:48.630> no<00:01:49.020> more<00:01:49.530> bad

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:49.710 
because it Canada has more no more bad

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:52.550 
because it Canada has more no more bad
conditions<00:01:50.280> maybe<00:01:50.520> dr.<00:01:50.850> ISM<00:01:51.360> that<00:01:51.570> they<00:01:52.470> are

00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:52.560
