00:01:28.450 --> 00:01:31.320 

I<00:01:28.650> usually<00:01:29.650> like<00:01:29.890> starting<00:01:30.280> back<00:01:30.490> off<00:01:30.759> with

00:01:31.330 --> 00:01:33.270 
I usually like starting back off with
some<00:01:31.540> like<00:01:31.689> your<00:01:31.869> chance<00:01:32.110> just<00:01:32.320> to<00:01:32.470> warm<00:01:33.130> up

for<00:01:33.430> everything<00:01:33.820> else<00:01:34.000> I<00:01:34.240> think<00:01:34.689> it's<00:01:34.810> a<00:01:34.930> good

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:35.080 
for everything else I think it's a good

00:01:35.080 --> 00:01:37.020 
for everything else I think it's a good
way<00:01:35.259> to<00:01:35.290> Lydon<00:01:36.040> and<00:01:36.100> picking<00:01:36.460> up<00:01:36.520> the<00:01:36.580> last<00:01:36.850> a

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:37.030 
way to Lydon and picking up the last a

00:01:37.030 --> 00:01:39.600 
way to Lydon and picking up the last a
little<00:01:37.119> bit<00:01:37.299> but<00:01:37.930> also<00:01:38.080> give<00:01:38.350> a<00:01:38.380> good<00:01:38.560> stuff<00:01:38.920> so

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:39.610 
little bit but also give a good stuff so

00:01:39.610 --> 00:01:40.560 
little bit but also give a good stuff so
then<00:01:39.759> when<00:01:39.880> you<00:01:39.909> get<00:01:40.090> into<00:01:40.240> your<00:01:40.450> own

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:40.570 
then when you get into your own

00:01:40.570 --> 00:01:42.420 
then when you get into your own
movements<00:01:41.110> and<00:01:41.229> stuff<00:01:41.409> you're<00:01:41.560> already<00:01:41.680> ready

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:42.430 
movements and stuff you're already ready

00:01:42.430 --> 00:01:59.220 
movements and stuff you're already ready
to<00:01:42.460> rock

00:01:59.220 --> 00:01:59.230 

00:01:59.230 --> 00:02:01.720 

so<00:02:00.230> typically<00:02:00.620> you<00:02:00.770> guys<00:02:00.950> would<00:02:01.130> see<00:02:01.280> someone

00:02:01.720 --> 00:02:01.730 
so typically you guys would see someone

00:02:01.730 --> 00:02:04.780 
so typically you guys would see someone
doing<00:02:01.910> bent<00:02:02.540> rows<00:02:02.750> over<00:02:03.110> him<00:02:03.500> well<00:02:04.100> although<00:02:04.760> I

00:02:04.780 --> 00:02:04.790 
doing bent rows over him well although I

00:02:04.790 --> 00:02:07.450 
doing bent rows over him well although I
I<00:02:05.090> do<00:02:05.270> find<00:02:05.600> that<00:02:05.630> effective<00:02:06.140> I<00:02:06.320> realize<00:02:07.250> that

00:02:07.450 --> 00:02:07.460 
I do find that effective I realize that

00:02:07.460 --> 00:02:09.790 
I do find that effective I realize that
doing<00:02:07.580> them<00:02:07.790> underhand<00:02:08.290> you<00:02:09.290> may<00:02:09.410> recruit<00:02:09.680> a

00:02:09.790 --> 00:02:09.800 
doing them underhand you may recruit a

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:13.660 
doing them underhand you may recruit a
little<00:02:09.979> bit<00:02:10.070> of<00:02:10.160> bicep<00:02:10.520> in<00:02:10.670> it<00:02:10.790> but<00:02:12.520> it's<00:02:13.520> more

00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:13.670 
little bit of bicep in it but it's more

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:16.420 
little bit of bicep in it but it's more
of<00:02:13.730> the<00:02:13.850> lower<00:02:14.030> laps<00:02:14.390> and<00:02:14.950> if<00:02:15.950> you<00:02:16.070> go<00:02:16.190> from<00:02:16.280> oh

00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:16.430 
of the lower laps and if you go from oh

00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:18.910 
of the lower laps and if you go from oh
seven<00:02:16.820> pictures<00:02:17.150> go<00:02:17.510> away<00:02:17.810> but<00:02:18.350> the<00:02:18.710> biggest

00:02:18.910 --> 00:02:18.920 
seven pictures go away but the biggest

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:42.509 
seven pictures go away but the biggest
difference<00:02:21.040> it<00:02:22.040> was<00:02:22.130> from<00:02:22.340> Heathrow

00:02:42.509 --> 00:02:42.519 

00:02:42.519 --> 00:02:45.759 

you<00:02:43.519> did<00:02:43.700> everything<00:02:43.909> with<00:02:44.480> both<00:02:44.720> arms<00:02:45.079> and

00:02:45.759 --> 00:02:45.769 
you did everything with both arms and

00:02:45.769 --> 00:02:47.130 
you did everything with both arms and
now<00:02:45.920> we're<00:02:46.040> working<00:02:46.159> each<00:02:46.430> one<00:02:46.610> individually

00:02:47.130 --> 00:02:47.140 
now we're working each one individually

00:02:47.140 --> 00:02:50.500 
now we're working each one individually
so<00:02:48.140> now<00:02:48.290> I<00:02:48.319> get<00:02:48.500> to<00:02:48.620> focus<00:02:48.769> on<00:02:49.189> which<00:02:50.090> side<00:02:50.299> make

00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:50.510 
so now I get to focus on which side make

00:02:50.510 --> 00:02:52.869 
so now I get to focus on which side make
me<00:02:50.599> stronger<00:02:50.980> which<00:02:51.980> I<00:02:52.099> may<00:02:52.280> be<00:02:52.340> having<00:02:52.640> a

00:02:52.869 --> 00:02:52.879 
me stronger which I may be having a

00:02:52.879 --> 00:03:07.460 
me stronger which I may be having a
little<00:02:53.090> bit<00:02:53.239> harder<00:02:54.079> time

00:03:07.460 --> 00:03:07.470 

00:03:07.470 --> 00:03:10.520 

I<00:03:08.300> want<00:03:09.300> to<00:03:09.390> make<00:03:09.510> sure<00:03:09.540> that<00:03:09.810> I'm<00:03:09.930> symmetrical

00:03:10.520 --> 00:03:10.530 
I want to make sure that I'm symmetrical

00:03:10.530 --> 00:03:28.110 
I want to make sure that I'm symmetrical
make<00:03:11.160> sure<00:03:11.340> that<00:03:11.490> everything<00:03:11.820> is<00:03:11.940> balanced

00:03:28.110 --> 00:03:28.120 

00:03:28.120 --> 00:03:29.760 

it's<00:03:28.570> kind<00:03:28.690> of<00:03:28.780> test<00:03:28.960> your<00:03:29.140> will<00:03:29.260> because<00:03:29.500> you

00:03:29.760 --> 00:03:29.770 
it's kind of test your will because you

00:03:29.770 --> 00:03:34.830 
it's kind of test your will because you
just<00:03:29.980> did<00:03:30.250> barbell<00:03:31.150> rows<00:03:31.810> and<00:03:33.720> you're<00:03:34.720> not

00:03:34.830 --> 00:03:34.840 
just did barbell rows and you're not

00:03:34.840 --> 00:03:36.870 
just did barbell rows and you're not
going<00:03:34.960> to<00:03:35.050> be<00:03:35.140> a<00:03:35.170> strong<00:03:35.500> but<00:03:35.850> mentally<00:03:36.850> you

00:03:36.870 --> 00:03:36.880 
going to be a strong but mentally you

00:03:36.880 --> 00:03:37.770 
going to be a strong but mentally you
can<00:03:36.970> get<00:03:37.210> through<00:03:37.360> it<00:03:37.420> and<00:03:37.630> you<00:03:37.720> can

00:03:37.770 --> 00:03:37.780 
can get through it and you can

00:03:37.780 --> 00:03:53.690 
can get through it and you can
definitely<00:03:37.990> Club

00:03:53.690 --> 00:03:53.700 

00:03:53.700 --> 00:03:56.280 

obviously<00:03:54.700> I<00:03:54.730> go<00:03:55.000> get<00:03:55.420> a<00:03:55.450> lot<00:03:55.629> of<00:03:55.750> chiropractic

00:03:56.280 --> 00:03:56.290 
obviously I go get a lot of chiropractic

00:03:56.290 --> 00:03:58.349 
obviously I go get a lot of chiropractic
work<00:03:56.469> done<00:03:56.680> and<00:03:56.950> and<00:03:57.400> execute<00:03:57.849> the<00:03:57.969> vacuum<00:03:58.269> is

00:03:58.349 --> 00:03:58.359 
work done and and execute the vacuum is

00:03:58.359 --> 00:04:00.149 
work done and and execute the vacuum is
perfect<00:03:58.780> alignments<00:03:59.260> within<00:03:59.409> the<00:03:59.560> mitigation

00:04:00.149 --> 00:04:00.159 
perfect alignments within the mitigation

00:04:00.159 --> 00:04:02.399 
perfect alignments within the mitigation
function<00:04:00.549> correctly<00:04:00.819> so<00:04:01.720> therefore<00:04:02.109> each

00:04:02.399 --> 00:04:02.409 
function correctly so therefore each

00:04:02.409 --> 00:04:05.460 
function correctly so therefore each
side<00:04:02.650> can<00:04:02.920> perform<00:04:03.310> that<00:04:03.970> is<00:04:04.180> bad<00:04:04.420> but<00:04:05.049> it's<00:04:05.349> up

00:04:05.460 --> 00:04:05.470 
side can perform that is bad but it's up

00:04:05.470 --> 00:04:07.199 
side can perform that is bad but it's up
to<00:04:05.500> me<00:04:05.739> to<00:04:05.769> make<00:04:06.129> sure<00:04:06.310> that<00:04:06.549> I'm<00:04:07.060> actually

00:04:07.199 --> 00:04:07.209 
to me to make sure that I'm actually

00:04:07.209 --> 00:04:41.590
