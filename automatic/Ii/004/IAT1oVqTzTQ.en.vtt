00:00:13.840 --> 00:00:20.060
 hello everyone with you sapan sir and today 

00:00:16.670 --> 00:00:21.560
 little badger bumpy not so long ago 

00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:24.950
 actually appeared in the game when 

00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:27.230
 German Fri-Shki there were but nice 

00:00:24.950 --> 00:00:28.850
 what else on the test server I have 

00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:30.610
 said something was wrong with him 

00:00:28.850 --> 00:00:34.360
 plan that Bosko turned out somehow 

00:00:30.610 --> 00:00:37.100
 too imbovo there is the only course I 

00:00:34.360 --> 00:00:39.170
 I made a mistake I thought that Barsik 

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:42.050
 will bend very much exactly here with 

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:44.660
 this rifled gun from e-100 with this 

00:00:42.050 --> 00:00:48.590
 am short on qoldi 

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:50.120
 but it turned out that the opposite is best 

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:52.149
 It feels like to lower hardy but 

00:00:50.120 --> 00:00:53.870
 there is a simple explanation 

00:00:52.149 --> 00:00:55.460
 it turned out as a result 

00:00:53.870 --> 00:00:57.739
 numerous fights in randomness that here 

00:00:55.460 --> 00:00:59.540
 This one here is a short arrow is not very convenient 

00:00:57.739 --> 00:01:02.270
 when firing long distances then 

00:00:59.540 --> 00:01:05.360
 Well, I see, there is inaccurate information 

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:05.780
 long ie it is necessary that the enemy as 

00:01:05.360 --> 00:01:07.790
 this 

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:10.850
 of 6 that is so that he stopped and 

00:01:07.790 --> 00:01:13.250
 long long stood in one place 

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:14.840
 then you can pour a street down 

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:17.659
 fully yet there projectile flies 

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:21.560
 after a second, then you can punch 

00:01:17.659 --> 00:01:24.680
 but mostly play with this one 

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:26.180
 it is cut very awkward here just yet 

00:01:24.680 --> 00:01:28.010
 such a contradiction that he is well 

00:01:26.180 --> 00:01:31.610
 He feels this is a tad gun 

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:34.100
 good at short distances but at the same time 

00:01:31.610 --> 00:01:37.070
 Barsik himself feels badly short 

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:39.350
 distances because there is no armor and 

00:01:37.070 --> 00:01:42.950
 The situation looks funny look 

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:45.530
 and it looks no doubt shoots 

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:50.270
 breaks usually don't bag it pretty 

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:53.290
 funny but it turned out like this 

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:57.140
 a small mistake but in general in general 

00:01:53.290 --> 00:01:58.610
 These are more accurate problems for 

00:01:57.140 --> 00:02:01.060
 a side it is not a problem this problem 

00:01:58.610 --> 00:02:03.409
 for all his opponents namely 

00:02:01.060 --> 00:02:07.220
 excellent masking small size 

00:02:03.409 --> 00:02:09.229
 great guns and it turned out that this 

00:02:07.220 --> 00:02:11.299
 here is the pasha who is now 

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:13.549
 she took her place already passed what 

00:02:11.299 --> 00:02:15.569
 that time but it turned out that she was some kind 

00:02:13.549 --> 00:02:18.719
 well, just super Fri-shka that is 

00:02:15.569 --> 00:02:22.499
 it does not glow does a lot of damage well yes 

00:02:18.719 --> 00:02:25.769
 you see me setting fire here t21 and 

00:02:22.499 --> 00:02:29.730
 Criticizes not fully engine but if 

00:02:25.769 --> 00:02:32.639
 generally speaking then the appearance 

00:02:29.730 --> 00:02:34.889
 all new and new pt with all new and 

00:02:32.639 --> 00:02:37.760
 new features and wonderful 

00:02:34.889 --> 00:02:39.930
 Well, of course, in some things it grieves 

00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:41.780
 why well here used to be on the eighth 

00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:44.069
 level and now there is Ferdinand 

00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:46.469
 Ferdinand axis said so like him 

00:02:44.069 --> 00:02:48.269
 there is some sort of armor horde that is top top 

00:02:46.469 --> 00:02:50.579
 200 millimeters in all that he can 

00:02:48.269 --> 00:02:53.489
 talk but generally slow but 

00:02:50.579 --> 00:02:56.069
 but he has a super gun now 

00:02:53.489 --> 00:02:57.840
 it turns out that his armor is not so 

00:02:56.069 --> 00:03:00.750
 serious because a lot of new ones 

00:02:57.840 --> 00:03:02.280
 the guns that sew it perfectly 

00:03:00.750 --> 00:03:06.299
 calm okay without any 

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:09.349
 problems and slowness left nowhere 

00:03:06.299 --> 00:03:11.219
 don't do the edge here you can with 

00:03:09.349 --> 00:03:13.769
 which can put a gun from 

00:03:11.219 --> 00:03:16.799
 ferdinand and with it here and 

00:03:13.769 --> 00:03:19.049
 better mobility and tower and disguise 

00:03:16.799 --> 00:03:21.209
 and the tower you understand the tower is that is 

00:03:19.049 --> 00:03:23.310
 here in a situation like me now 

00:03:21.209 --> 00:03:26.090
 being ferdinand would have to 

00:03:23.310 --> 00:03:29.189
 glows all the way you down there 

00:03:26.090 --> 00:03:32.250
 bend over and try to somehow aim 

00:03:29.189 --> 00:03:34.290
 substituting my frontal armor I leave 

00:03:32.250 --> 00:03:36.060
 and through the use of this slide 

00:03:34.290 --> 00:03:38.699
 I stop at her a little, look like this 

00:03:36.060 --> 00:03:41.069
 that the gun did not start and poor t30 

00:03:38.699 --> 00:03:43.590
 Foursome normal babeshkami see this 

00:03:41.069 --> 00:03:46.470
 even cumulative shooting usually normal 

00:03:43.590 --> 00:03:48.659
 shirts cause her damage 

00:03:46.470 --> 00:03:52.439
 see a lot and it's all enough for 

00:03:48.659 --> 00:03:55.079
 they are unpleasant in fact according to mine 

00:03:52.439 --> 00:03:57.419
 To representations here these two cars 

00:03:55.079 --> 00:04:00.810
 leopard and following her Athens trager on 

00:03:57.419 --> 00:04:02.579
 the base of the keyhole they are just about 

00:04:00.810 --> 00:04:05.209
 all parameters better than 

00:04:02.579 --> 00:04:07.829
 corresponding ferdinand and yagtigr 

00:04:05.209 --> 00:04:09.989
 Jagdtigr is now generally not needed but it 

00:04:07.829 --> 00:04:11.489
 the word has repeatedly been spoken there not 

00:04:09.989 --> 00:04:12.060
 he spoke on stream I say that 

00:04:11.489 --> 00:04:14.549
 yagtigr 

00:04:12.060 --> 00:04:16.709
 and Ferdinand is not needed right now that is 

00:04:14.549 --> 00:04:17.789
 why do you need ferdinand if you can take 

00:04:16.709 --> 00:04:20.250
 same gun 

00:04:17.789 --> 00:04:24.100
 while still with the tower while still 

00:04:20.250 --> 00:04:25.900
 case of disguise actually on 

00:04:24.100 --> 00:04:28.900
 a strange little picture 

00:04:25.900 --> 00:04:31.090
 here I as you know I love the little badger 

00:04:28.900 --> 00:04:34.450
 I stayed in the hangar I sometimes him 

00:04:31.090 --> 00:04:37.780
 rolling out but be honest here 

00:04:34.450 --> 00:04:41.220
 the presence of such a machine in my opinion 

00:04:37.780 --> 00:04:44.380
 satisfied balance but overall me 

00:04:41.220 --> 00:04:47.410
 grieves especially funny when I 

00:04:44.380 --> 00:04:49.450
 recently ride 100 Japanese one 

00:04:47.410 --> 00:04:50.740
 average tank like nothing from everything he has 

00:04:49.450 --> 00:04:52.860
 well there i mean i said that 

00:04:50.740 --> 00:04:57.010
 Basically, I liked the car, but here 

00:04:52.860 --> 00:04:59.140
 You play on the side of Khloby and there 750 

00:04:57.010 --> 00:04:59.560
 salt is easy there with this gun us alone 

00:04:59.140 --> 00:05:02.170
 shot 

00:04:59.560 --> 00:05:03.910
 another shot at another 750 when 

00:05:02.170 --> 00:05:05.920
 this is very often nobody sees you there 

00:05:03.910 --> 00:05:08.410
 but if you play a gun from Verdi you need but by 

00:05:05.920 --> 00:05:12.400
 500 throwing well, too, at the eighth level 

00:05:08.410 --> 00:05:14.110
 it is very much possible and the whole fight to Article 1 

00:05:12.400 --> 00:05:16.270
 play actively trying to do something 

00:05:14.110 --> 00:05:19.570
 aggressive next to the opponent that is 

00:05:16.270 --> 00:05:21.850
 constantly there dodging somehow on 

00:05:19.570 --> 00:05:23.770
 short well or medium distances there 

00:05:21.850 --> 00:05:25.200
 highlighting and at the same time at the end of the fight 

00:05:23.770 --> 00:05:28.810
 lookin there 

00:05:25.200 --> 00:05:32.400
 2001 seems like a very active game like everything 

00:05:28.810 --> 00:05:34.990
 affairs but simply do not have the alpha 

00:05:32.400 --> 00:05:36.280
 there is not always room for shots 

00:05:34.990 --> 00:05:39.720
 opportunity for a shot found 

00:05:36.280 --> 00:05:43.570
 shot well there 250 damage a 

00:05:39.720 --> 00:05:46.680
 here actually bang and all is well 

00:05:43.570 --> 00:05:49.210
 immediately a lot of damage and face and start here 

00:05:46.680 --> 00:05:53.860
 there is some contradiction here in this 

00:05:49.210 --> 00:05:55.360
 Iâ€™ll say everything again and while there 

00:05:53.860 --> 00:05:57.370
 I advise you to try 

00:05:55.360 --> 00:05:59.380
 I am sure that 

00:05:57.370 --> 00:06:01.030
 I need to nerf him just absolutely 

00:05:59.380 --> 00:06:04.270
 I am convinced this most important thing 

00:06:01.030 --> 00:06:07.960
 this is exactly the accuracy of information here 

00:06:04.270 --> 00:06:09.310
 guns 2 are not exactly 2 guns here 

00:06:07.960 --> 00:06:10.440
 but maybe something disguised 

00:06:09.310 --> 00:06:13.650
 because well 

00:06:10.440 --> 00:06:15.480
 here masking is just super payment here 

00:06:13.650 --> 00:06:18.660
 such cases are an example for you by the way 

00:06:15.480 --> 00:06:21.810
 fight in the top here at this top gun in 

00:06:18.660 --> 00:06:23.550
 Listona bebeshka, too, I'm on gold already 

00:06:21.810 --> 00:06:26.700
 moved because the barrel ended 

00:06:23.550 --> 00:06:29.490
 note it can be done without them 

00:06:26.700 --> 00:06:31.830
 such a fight is very short I expressed 

00:06:29.490 --> 00:06:34.140
 you have some such chagrin 

00:06:31.830 --> 00:06:36.420
 here is this imbalance about new cars 

00:06:34.140 --> 00:06:39.570
 leave your comments to obo 

00:06:36.420 --> 00:06:43.550
 all this think on this for today all 

00:06:39.570 --> 00:06:43.550
 and thank you for your attention 

00:06:52.220 --> 00:06:58.020
 it's time to take the music with you to 

00:06:56.070 --> 00:07:01.190
 go 

00:06:58.020 --> 00:07:01.190
 do not stop 

00:07:04.249 --> 00:07:09.069
 new line of headsets and thats from sound 

00:07:06.949 --> 00:07:09.069
 blaster
