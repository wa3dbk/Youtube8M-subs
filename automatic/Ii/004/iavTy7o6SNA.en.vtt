00:00:00.460 --> 00:00:05.890
 good friends and welcome today to a 

00:00:02.889 --> 00:00:07.359
 new video over anses games 29 in 

00:00:05.890 --> 00:00:10.030
 this video I will present a map 

00:00:07.359 --> 00:00:13.269
 called frozen I do not know if it has to do 

00:00:10.030 --> 00:00:14.650
 something with the saga with the movie or not 

00:00:13.269 --> 00:00:17.199
 I have no idea the truth I do not have 

00:00:14.650 --> 00:00:20.349
 absolutely no idea but we are in 

00:00:17.199 --> 00:00:22.569
 a kind of snowy biome expensive 

00:00:20.349 --> 00:00:24.130
 sir I ask you to know this I am loading 

00:00:22.569 --> 00:00:26.109
 Chus is worth it because he arrived here 

00:00:24.130 --> 00:00:29.499
 here three hours trying to load all 

00:00:26.109 --> 00:00:32.009
 the chips and the otan to june 16 the most 

00:00:29.499 --> 00:00:32.009
 what can you do 

00:00:32.599 --> 00:00:39.320
 in minecraft and is that not 

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:41.120
 I do not know what happens that no charge costs you 

00:00:39.320 --> 00:00:44.059
 minecraft costs is worth and I do not get the 

00:00:41.120 --> 00:00:46.579
 60 fps those now you will imagine what 

00:00:44.059 --> 00:00:49.390
 it must be this because it is one is a 

00:00:46.579 --> 00:00:49.390
 bestiality 

00:00:49.810 --> 00:00:54.460
 with this part perhaps the least epic 

00:00:52.990 --> 00:00:57.670
 because it 's made here of blocks of 

00:00:54.460 --> 00:01:00.420
 restaurants is fine but but now 

00:00:57.670 --> 00:01:00.420
 it's the epic thing 

00:01:01.300 --> 00:01:05.520
 I will put the f1 as usual 

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:13.410
 how they have built a city and then 

00:01:11.370 --> 00:01:16.050
 they have come come let us flood what 

00:01:13.410 --> 00:01:18.950
 it's already been good not but what 

00:01:16.050 --> 00:01:18.950
 Strangest not 

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:23.320
 you wrote the photo of the photos of 

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:29.759
 of this and has called me a lot the 

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:32.030
 attention to see let's go inside if 

00:01:29.759 --> 00:01:32.030
 we can 

00:01:32.550 --> 00:01:40.670
 to think what I start doing this 

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:42.740
 and they are giving me a beating my mother 

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:45.590
 is everything with my world is like a 

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:48.020
 kind of castile flooded mania this 

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:52.250
 is going 8 fps is it worth 

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:56.770
 and I used to normally 100 to 60 as 

00:01:52.250 --> 00:01:56.770
 little but this is already very 

00:01:57.260 --> 00:02:03.150
 I do not know what is happening day or 

00:02:00.900 --> 00:02:05.940
 notice yes 

00:02:03.150 --> 00:02:08.130
 this is stones to our screws 

00:02:05.940 --> 00:02:11.680
 as it was luminous stone and have had 

00:02:08.130 --> 00:02:14.590
 to work with remains 

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:16.510
 and water go good ass can put 

00:02:14.590 --> 00:02:18.489
 blocks of those that are so wide 

00:02:16.510 --> 00:02:21.819
 still do not load the Chinese seriously be 

00:02:18.489 --> 00:02:25.400
 please load such difficult loads 

00:02:21.819 --> 00:02:28.269
 please God 

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:28.269
 and there is something 

00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:32.390
 Hello 

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:39.420
 you know what I'm going to do about darkness 

00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:39.420
 because darkness 

00:02:44.650 --> 00:02:47.340
 night 

00:02:48.490 --> 00:02:52.560
 they are nocturnal six minutes very rich 

00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:56.780
 to the key or pitic 

00:02:54.520 --> 00:02:59.569
 OK 

00:02:56.780 --> 00:03:00.650
 Well, this is very strange because 

00:02:59.569 --> 00:03:04.300
 notice 

00:03:00.650 --> 00:03:07.130
 fix is like parkour vale but parkour 

00:03:04.300 --> 00:03:09.170
 and then they have flooded I do not know if I 

00:03:07.130 --> 00:03:11.319
 you understand why there suddenly blocks 

00:03:09.170 --> 00:03:16.079
 of ice 

00:03:11.319 --> 00:03:16.079
 it's something very weird, weird, weird 

00:03:18.250 --> 00:03:23.400
 and suddenly we have this 

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:24.930
 well then to see if this what you think 

00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:26.100
 I think this is prettier good what 

00:03:24.930 --> 00:03:27.870
 I'm doing with a package of 

00:03:26.100 --> 00:03:29.490
 textures that I've done a review what 

00:03:27.870 --> 00:03:32.070
 you can search my channel is called plea 

00:03:29.490 --> 00:03:34.470
 DÃ­az craft what I was seeing is worth the 

00:03:32.070 --> 00:03:35.940
 photos of when I downloaded this map 

00:03:34.470 --> 00:03:37.290
 they were much better that's why I've 

00:03:35.940 --> 00:03:38.760
 downloaded why do not I download 

00:03:37.290 --> 00:03:40.510
 anything and of course it was done with 

00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:42.689
 a package of textures 

00:03:40.510 --> 00:03:45.610
 and here I expected something else and well 

00:03:42.689 --> 00:03:50.200
 I like this a little bit better but 

00:03:45.610 --> 00:03:52.050
 he does not follow me without convincing me if 

00:03:50.200 --> 00:03:54.360
 you understand 

00:03:52.050 --> 00:03:56.130
 and I say the same thing is a map book 

00:03:54.360 --> 00:03:58.230
 on the plan that everything was done before 

00:03:56.130 --> 00:04:00.300
 of ice and it has melted to know you know 

00:03:58.230 --> 00:04:02.160
 I imagined anything because 

00:04:00.300 --> 00:04:04.230
 as we can see a lot of ice and such and I 

00:04:02.160 --> 00:04:05.910
 I say the same thing or it's melted and this does not 

00:04:04.230 --> 00:04:07.680
 it was like that it was ice because I 

00:04:05.910 --> 00:04:10.170
 I imagined it like that but it was the package of 

00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:12.750
 textures that I have modified and now see 

00:04:10.170 --> 00:04:15.060
 yes, to see if I'm discharged not to know if 

00:04:12.750 --> 00:04:17.340
 that lost trying the three pack 

00:04:15.060 --> 00:04:19.470
 texture packs and well this is 

00:04:17.340 --> 00:04:22.670
 well let's try another one of those that 

00:04:19.470 --> 00:04:22.670
 they are here I have done 

00:04:23.330 --> 00:04:28.419
 I've reviewed so it 's perfect 

00:04:28.440 --> 00:04:34.670
 I'm going to try all but the dragon of 

00:04:30.330 --> 00:04:34.670
 I remember that he left me a 

00:04:35.040 --> 00:04:37.430
 uff 

00:04:39.590 --> 00:04:44.500
 it left a very bad taste in my mouth 

00:04:42.700 --> 00:04:48.490
 it does not seem that we are in the true 

00:04:44.500 --> 00:04:50.610
 now yes but here you do not see and that's how 

00:04:48.490 --> 00:04:50.610
 is 

00:04:53.900 --> 00:05:00.830
 It's not very cool to see but it's missing 

00:04:57.740 --> 00:05:02.260
 let's see more things know the short 

00:05:00.830 --> 00:05:04.930
 beat 

00:05:02.260 --> 00:05:07.090
 they are all and my channel I repeat if I 

00:05:04.930 --> 00:05:08.790
 you want to see more of each one and 

00:05:07.090 --> 00:05:11.480
 such 

00:05:08.790 --> 00:05:11.480
 good 

00:05:11.990 --> 00:05:15.790
 I like more this I think he 

00:05:19.050 --> 00:05:23.350
 support to improve does not intervene 

00:05:21.550 --> 00:05:24.940
 is that you do not see anything uncle if you saw 

00:05:23.350 --> 00:05:27.700
 something we are talking about I have vision 

00:05:24.940 --> 00:05:31.260
 nightly and I see absolutely nothing 

00:05:27.700 --> 00:05:31.260
 here here to see 

00:05:32.330 --> 00:05:35.680
 this is asking for the luminous truth 

00:05:37.540 --> 00:05:44.680
 It seems that it is typical that the 

00:05:41.520 --> 00:05:47.620
 cartoons 

00:05:44.680 --> 00:05:50.470
 but the truth does not convince me much is 

00:05:47.620 --> 00:05:52.300
 that when I played when I saw this 

00:05:50.470 --> 00:05:54.990
 map to download calls me a lot 

00:05:52.300 --> 00:05:58.260
 the attention because it was very nice but 

00:05:54.990 --> 00:06:00.330
 It leaves me like it leaves me a little more 

00:05:58.260 --> 00:06:02.780
 to make the photo of the miniature as 

00:06:00.330 --> 00:06:05.860
 whenever I do it live and live 

00:06:02.780 --> 00:06:07.990
 I forget it 

00:06:05.860 --> 00:06:10.349
 let's see I'm taking as an example the 

00:06:07.990 --> 00:06:10.349
 tower 

00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:15.350
 and if you realize it is all flooded 

00:06:12.980 --> 00:06:17.180
 do not 

00:06:15.350 --> 00:06:19.160
 good guys I think we're going to stop by 

00:06:17.180 --> 00:06:22.540
 here a lot to see on this map has 

00:06:19.160 --> 00:06:24.740
 left a little but good is not bad 

00:06:22.540 --> 00:06:27.530
 so nothing guys I hope that I have 

00:06:24.740 --> 00:06:29.750
