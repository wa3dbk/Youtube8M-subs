EOTech sights the next best site next to
the<00:00:31.080> target<00:00:31.289> finder<00:00:31.590> and<00:00:31.949> in<00:00:32.790> my<00:00:33.090> book<00:00:33.420> mainly

00:00:33.889 --> 00:00:33.899 
the target finder and in my book mainly

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:36.139 
the target finder and in my book mainly
because<00:00:33.930> that<00:00:34.440> actually<00:00:34.739> reduces<00:00:35.520> recoil<00:00:35.730> on

00:00:36.139 --> 00:00:36.149 
because that actually reduces recoil on

00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:37.910 
because that actually reduces recoil on
your<00:00:36.360> weapons<00:00:36.719> so<00:00:36.960> you<00:00:37.559> have<00:00:37.649> a<00:00:37.710> choice<00:00:37.770> to

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:37.920 
your weapons so you have a choice to

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:39.380 
your weapons so you have a choice to
neotech<00:00:38.430> and<00:00:38.579> red<00:00:38.700> dot<00:00:38.850> read<00:00:39.030> that<00:00:39.180> gives<00:00:39.360> a

00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:39.390 
neotech and red dot read that gives a

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:40.790 
neotech and red dot read that gives a
little<00:00:39.510> bit<00:00:39.600> more<00:00:39.750> peripheral<00:00:40.140> you'll<00:00:40.559> take

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:40.800 
little bit more peripheral you'll take

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:42.740 
little bit more peripheral you'll take
lowers<00:00:41.219> your<00:00:41.309> recoil<00:00:41.790> just<00:00:42.149> a<00:00:42.239> little<00:00:42.480> bit<00:00:42.600> and

00:00:42.740 --> 00:00:42.750 
lowers your recoil just a little bit and

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:45.200 
lowers your recoil just a little bit and
weapons<00:00:43.500> like<00:00:43.649> the<00:00:43.860> SMR<00:00:44.430> anything<00:00:45.090> that

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:45.210 
weapons like the SMR anything that

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:47.479 
weapons like the SMR anything that
reduces<00:00:45.329> your<00:00:45.629> recoil<00:00:45.989> is<00:00:46.260> a<00:00:46.890> good<00:00:47.100> thing<00:00:47.280> at

00:00:47.479 --> 00:00:47.489 
reduces your recoil is a good thing at

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:50.720 
reduces your recoil is a good thing at
least<00:00:47.550> it<00:00:47.820> is<00:00:47.969> in<00:00:48.149> my<00:00:48.420> book<00:00:48.690> personally<00:00:49.730> so

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:50.730 
least it is in my book personally so

I<00:03:12.790> actually<00:03:13.180> said<00:03:13.540> that<00:03:13.690> in<00:03:13.840> a<00:03:13.930> video<00:03:14.200> where

00:03:14.430 --> 00:03:14.440 
I actually said that in a video where

00:03:14.440 --> 00:03:16.500 
I actually said that in a video where
the<00:03:14.530> m4<00:03:15.010> and<00:03:15.430> I<00:03:15.549> was<00:03:15.670> running<00:03:15.760> a<00:03:15.880> UAV<00:03:16.090> counter

00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:16.510 
the m4 and I was running a UAV counter

00:03:16.510 --> 00:03:17.580 
the m4 and I was running a UAV counter
you<00:03:16.599> being<00:03:16.840> chopper<00:03:17.049> gunner<00:03:17.320> and<00:03:17.440> I<00:03:17.500> was

00:03:17.580 --> 00:03:17.590 
you being chopper gunner and I was

00:03:17.590 --> 00:03:18.900 
you being chopper gunner and I was
getting<00:03:17.799> a<00:03:17.829> chopper<00:03:18.040> gunner<00:03:18.160> consistently

00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:18.910 
getting a chopper gunner consistently

00:03:18.910 --> 00:03:22.349 
getting a chopper gunner consistently
counter<00:03:19.810> UAV<00:03:19.989> is<00:03:20.380> so<00:03:20.590> strong<00:03:20.920> and<00:03:21.299> you<00:03:22.299> know

00:03:22.349 --> 00:03:22.359 
counter UAV is so strong and you know

00:03:22.359 --> 00:03:24.090 
counter UAV is so strong and you know
why<00:03:22.480> is<00:03:22.540> it<00:03:22.720> so<00:03:22.840> strong<00:03:23.140> you're<00:03:23.739> denying

00:03:24.090 --> 00:03:24.100 
why is it so strong you're denying

00:03:24.100 --> 00:03:26.400 
why is it so strong you're denying
information<00:03:24.760> I<00:03:24.940> really<00:03:25.600> like<00:03:25.780> this<00:03:25.930> setup<00:03:26.140> too

00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:26.410 
information I really like this setup too

00:03:26.410 --> 00:03:27.930 
information I really like this setup too
because<00:03:26.739> it<00:03:26.920> kind<00:03:27.400> of<00:03:27.459> makes<00:03:27.609> the<00:03:27.760> game<00:03:27.880> a

00:03:27.930 --> 00:03:27.940 
because it kind of makes the game a

00:03:27.940 --> 00:03:29.580 
because it kind of makes the game a
little<00:03:28.150> bit<00:03:28.239> more<00:03:28.480> fun<00:03:28.720> when<00:03:29.290> you're<00:03:29.440> actually

00:03:29.580 --> 00:03:29.590 
little bit more fun when you're actually

00:03:29.590 --> 00:03:31.590 
little bit more fun when you're actually
just<00:03:29.920> going<00:03:30.069> for<00:03:30.370> the<00:03:30.549> for<00:03:30.970> the<00:03:31.000> nuke<00:03:31.239> metals

00:03:31.590 --> 00:03:31.600 
just going for the for the nuke metals

00:03:31.600 --> 00:03:33.420 
just going for the for the nuke metals
and<00:03:31.780> let<00:03:31.900> the<00:03:32.079> Recon<00:03:32.470> killstreaks<00:03:32.950> do<00:03:33.310> that

00:03:33.420 --> 00:03:33.430 
and let the Recon killstreaks do that

00:03:33.430 --> 00:03:35.370 
and let the Recon killstreaks do that
really<00:03:33.640> well<00:03:33.760> because<00:03:34.120> you're<00:03:34.299> never<00:03:34.450> running

00:03:35.370 --> 00:03:35.380 
really well because you're never running

00:03:35.380 --> 00:03:37.770 
really well because you're never running
a<00:03:35.560> dragon<00:03:35.980> fire<00:03:36.220> you're<00:03:36.430> never<00:03:36.630> running<00:03:37.630> a

00:03:37.770 --> 00:03:37.780 
a dragon fire you're never running a

00:03:37.780 --> 00:03:39.090 
a dragon fire you're never running a
stealth<00:03:38.079> chopper<00:03:38.319> just<00:03:38.560> constantly<00:03:38.920> having

00:03:39.090 --> 00:03:39.100 
stealth chopper just constantly having

00:03:39.100 --> 00:03:41.220 
stealth chopper just constantly having
people<00:03:39.400> flow<00:03:39.579> into<00:03:39.940> you<00:03:40.090> and<00:03:40.269> once<00:03:40.930> you<00:03:41.049> get<00:03:41.200> a

00:03:41.220 --> 00:03:41.230 
people flow into you and once you get a

00:03:41.230 --> 00:03:42.930 
people flow into you and once you get a
blackbird<00:03:41.709> blackbird<00:03:41.739> kind<00:03:42.430> of<00:03:42.519> stack<00:03:42.730> on<00:03:42.910> top

00:03:42.930 --> 00:03:42.940 
blackbird blackbird kind of stack on top

00:03:42.940 --> 00:03:44.940 
blackbird blackbird kind of stack on top
of<00:03:43.090> each<00:03:43.329> other<00:03:43.569> I<00:03:43.870> mean<00:03:44.350> I've<00:03:44.440> seen<00:03:44.560> oppressed

00:03:44.940 --> 00:03:44.950 
of each other I mean I've seen oppressed

00:03:44.950 --> 00:03:46.680 
of each other I mean I've seen oppressed
or<00:03:45.100> just<00:03:45.340> today<00:03:45.609> said<00:03:45.880> they're<00:03:46.000> commenting

00:03:46.680 --> 00:03:46.690 
or just today said they're commenting

00:03:46.690 --> 00:03:49.080 
or just today said they're commenting
and<00:03:47.170> crying<00:03:47.440> about<00:03:47.769> the<00:03:47.950> about<00:03:48.579> the<00:03:48.639> orbital

00:03:49.080 --> 00:03:49.090 
and crying about the about the orbital

00:03:49.090 --> 00:03:50.879 
and crying about the about the orbital
vsat<00:03:49.239> itself<00:03:49.989> I<00:03:50.139> mean<00:03:50.290> like<00:03:50.440> why<00:03:50.590> would<00:03:50.799> you

00:03:50.879 --> 00:03:50.889 
vsat itself I mean like why would you

00:03:50.889 --> 00:03:53.250 
vsat itself I mean like why would you
crime<00:03:51.100> out<00:03:51.250> the<00:03:51.310> orbital<00:03:51.639> vsat<00:03:51.790> dude<00:03:52.209> I<00:03:52.420> mean

00:03:53.250 --> 00:03:53.260 
crime out the orbital vsat dude I mean

00:03:53.260 --> 00:03:55.530 
crime out the orbital vsat dude I mean
the<00:03:53.380> orbital<00:03:53.680> vsat<00:03:53.829> is<00:03:54.730> what<00:03:54.910> makes<00:03:55.120> this<00:03:55.269> game

00:03:55.530 --> 00:03:55.540 
the orbital vsat is what makes this game

00:03:55.540 --> 00:03:58.110 
the orbital vsat is what makes this game
playable<00:03:56.019> in<00:03:56.230> my<00:03:56.380> book<00:03:56.650> I<00:03:56.859> mean<00:03:57.549> I<00:03:57.609> love<00:03:57.970> the

00:03:58.110 --> 00:03:58.120 
playable in my book I mean I love the

00:03:58.120 --> 00:04:00.840 
playable in my book I mean I love the
orbital<00:03:58.510> vsat<00:03:58.799> do<00:03:59.799> I<00:03:59.859> think<00:04:00.250> it<00:04:00.400> should<00:04:00.639> be<00:04:00.700> in

00:04:00.840 --> 00:04:00.850 
orbital vsat do I think it should be in

00:04:00.850 --> 00:04:03.539 
orbital vsat do I think it should be in
call<00:04:01.030> of<00:04:01.060> duty<00:04:01.209> no<00:04:02.079> I<00:04:02.410> mean<00:04:03.010> I<00:04:03.069> said<00:04:03.310> that<00:04:03.459> in

00:04:03.539 --> 00:04:03.549 
call of duty no I mean I said that in

00:04:03.549 --> 00:04:06.180 
call of duty no I mean I said that in
black<00:04:03.730> ops<00:04:03.970> 1<00:04:04.090> I<00:04:04.510> mean<00:04:05.200> the<00:04:05.319> orbital<00:04:05.620> vsat<00:04:05.769> is

00:04:06.180 --> 00:04:06.190 
black ops 1 I mean the orbital vsat is

00:04:06.190 --> 00:04:08.699 
black ops 1 I mean the orbital vsat is
so<00:04:06.459> strong<00:04:06.819> that<00:04:07.090> if<00:04:07.480> they<00:04:08.109> put<00:04:08.350> it<00:04:08.440> in<00:04:08.470> the

00:04:08.699 --> 00:04:08.709 
so strong that if they put it in the

00:04:08.709 --> 00:04:10.170 
so strong that if they put it in the
game<00:04:08.920> they<00:04:09.130> should<00:04:09.400> it<00:04:09.549> should<00:04:09.579> be<00:04:09.910> where<00:04:10.060> the

00:04:10.170 --> 00:04:10.180 
game they should it should be where the

00:04:10.180 --> 00:04:12.840 
game they should it should be where the
swarm<00:04:10.510> is<00:04:10.660> that<00:04:10.840> it<00:04:11.350> did<00:04:11.560> seriously<00:04:12.100> stuff

00:04:12.840 --> 00:04:12.850 
swarm is that it did seriously stuff

00:04:12.850 --> 00:04:15.150 
swarm is that it did seriously stuff
like<00:04:13.030> dogs<00:04:13.299> dogs<00:04:13.810> should<00:04:14.079> be<00:04:14.109> like<00:04:14.350> 1200<00:04:15.010> and

00:04:15.150 --> 00:04:15.160 
like dogs dogs should be like 1200 and

00:04:15.160 --> 00:04:17.009 
like dogs dogs should be like 1200 and
the<00:04:15.549> in<00:04:15.760> the<00:04:15.970> orbital<00:04:16.299> beasts<00:04:16.450> that<00:04:16.630> should<00:04:16.870> be

00:04:17.009 --> 00:04:17.019 
the in the orbital beasts that should be

00:04:17.019 --> 00:04:19.289 
the in the orbital beasts that should be
where<00:04:17.260> dogs<00:04:17.530> or<00:04:17.859> the<00:04:17.889> swarm<00:04:18.280> is<00:04:18.430> that<00:04:18.609> because

00:04:19.289 --> 00:04:19.299 
where dogs or the swarm is that because

00:04:19.299 --> 00:04:21.210 
where dogs or the swarm is that because
that's<00:04:19.720> where<00:04:19.989> the<00:04:20.169> meat<00:04:20.650> potato<00:04:21.010> the

00:04:21.210 --> 00:04:21.220 
that's where the meat potato the

00:04:21.220 --> 00:04:23.640 
that's where the meat potato the
killstreaks<00:04:21.700> deserve<00:04:22.090> to<00:04:22.210> be<00:04:22.360> and<00:04:22.599> if<00:04:23.260> it<00:04:23.440> was

00:04:23.640 --> 00:04:23.650 
killstreaks deserve to be and if it was

00:04:23.650 --> 00:04:26.180 
killstreaks deserve to be and if it was
where<00:04:23.919> swarm<00:04:24.159> is<00:04:24.280> that<00:04:24.430> I'd<00:04:24.610> still<00:04:25.180> run<00:04:25.510> it<00:04:25.630> is

00:04:26.180 --> 00:04:26.190 
where swarm is that I'd still run it is

00:04:26.190 --> 00:04:28.070 
where swarm is that I'd still run it is
