00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:48.030 
you're doing it this way so that you can

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:50.810 
you're doing it this way so that you can
get<00:00:48.239> the<00:00:49.020> different<00:00:49.320> icons<00:00:49.620> and<00:00:49.890> then<00:00:50.700> you

00:00:50.810 --> 00:00:50.820 
get the different icons and then you

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:52.760 
get the different icons and then you
just<00:00:50.969> go<00:00:51.120> play<00:00:51.329> a<00:00:51.360> premade<00:00:51.719> 5<00:00:51.989> and<00:00:52.320> that<00:00:52.649> will

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:52.770 
just go play a premade 5 and that will

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:54.410 
just go play a premade 5 and that will
unlock<00:00:52.949> your<00:00:53.250> 4th<00:00:53.460> icon<00:00:53.670> and<00:00:54.000> then<00:00:54.120> upon

00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:54.420 
unlock your 4th icon and then upon

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:56.540
