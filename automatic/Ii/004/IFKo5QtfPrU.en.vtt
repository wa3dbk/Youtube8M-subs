00:00:31.099 --> 00:00:34.789

 the Colombian tie that says caterpillar the 

00:00:43.969 --> 00:00:47.359
 the year he touched him, he was going to take his car

 They recommended a super beach 

00:00:47.359 --> 00:00:50.840
 recondite and hidden and the truth is that 

00:00:49.070 --> 00:00:53.059
 It was very beautiful but one year later 

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:54.710

00:00:53.059 --> 00:00:57.199

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:19.430
