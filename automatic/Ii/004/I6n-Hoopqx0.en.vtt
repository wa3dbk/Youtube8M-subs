gravity falls so seeing that is a pretty

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:49.240 
gravity falls so seeing that is a pretty
anxious<00:01:47.869> let<00:01:48.050> me<00:01:48.200> turn<00:01:48.320> my<00:01:48.470> fan<00:01:48.619> back<00:01:48.860> on<00:01:49.040> so

college right down the coker quick here

00:02:03.050 --> 00:02:18.040 
college right down the coker quick here
where's<00:02:03.740> my<00:02:03.860> pin<00:02:07.300> let's<00:02:08.300> see<00:02:08.539> here

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:18.050 

00:02:18.050 --> 00:02:25.270 

space

00:02:25.270 --> 00:02:25.280 

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:30.380 

three

00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:30.390 

00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:47.300 

14

00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:47.310 

00:02:47.310 --> 00:03:03.040 

940

00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:03.050 

00:03:03.050 --> 00:03:07.700 

ok

00:03:07.700 --> 00:03:07.710 

00:03:07.710 --> 00:03:23.350 

dot<00:03:08.340> dot<00:03:10.190> dot

00:03:23.350 --> 00:03:23.360 

00:03:23.360 --> 00:03:25.680 

alright

00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:25.690 
alright

00:03:25.690 --> 00:03:29.200 
alright
so

00:03:29.200 --> 00:03:29.210 

00:03:29.210 --> 00:03:31.340 

guess<00:03:29.810> we<00:03:29.990> should

00:03:31.340 --> 00:03:31.350 
guess we should

00:03:31.350 --> 00:03:37.809 
guess we should
to<00:03:32.250> code<00:03:32.430> this<00:03:32.610> real<00:03:32.850> quick

00:03:37.809 --> 00:03:37.819 

00:03:37.819 --> 00:03:40.130 

it's<00:03:38.819> really<00:03:39.180> hard<00:03:39.390> to<00:03:39.510> do<00:03:39.659> because<00:03:39.840> I'm<00:03:40.049> not

00:03:40.130 --> 00:03:40.140 
it's really hard to do because I'm not

00:03:40.140 --> 00:03:42.619 
it's really hard to do because I'm not
sitting<00:03:40.439> at<00:03:41.040> my<00:03:41.129> desk<00:03:41.159> there's<00:03:42.120> my<00:03:42.239> computers

00:03:42.619 --> 00:03:42.629 
sitting at my desk there's my computers

00:03:42.629 --> 00:03:51.900 
sitting at my desk there's my computers
on<00:03:42.750> the<00:03:42.780> floor

00:03:51.900 --> 00:03:51.910 

00:03:51.910 --> 00:04:00.360 

alright<00:03:53.190> so<00:03:54.570> 20<00:03:55.570> and<00:03:55.840> 15<00:03:56.350> so<00:03:57.010> 20<00:03:57.430> is<00:03:57.580> T<00:03:57.940> I<00:03:59.280> have<00:04:00.280> a

00:04:00.360 --> 00:04:00.370 
alright so 20 and 15 so 20 is T I have a

00:04:00.370 --> 00:04:03.930 
alright so 20 and 15 so 20 is T I have a
feeling<00:04:00.520> I<00:04:00.730> know<00:04:00.760> what<00:04:00.940> the<00:04:01.030> code<00:04:01.210> is<00:04:02.880> kind<00:04:03.880> of

00:04:03.930 --> 00:04:03.940 
feeling I know what the code is kind of

00:04:03.940 --> 00:04:11.730 
feeling I know what the code is kind of
redundant<00:04:04.980> okay<00:04:06.060> t<00:04:08.850> +<00:04:09.850> 15<00:04:10.480> is<00:04:10.630> oh<00:04:10.750> yeah<00:04:11.200> it's

00:04:11.730 --> 00:04:11.740 
redundant okay t + 15 is oh yeah it's

00:04:11.740 --> 00:04:15.600 
redundant okay t + 15 is oh yeah it's
definitely<00:04:12.010> what<00:04:12.310> it<00:04:12.400> is<00:04:12.550> and<00:04:14.100> two<00:04:15.100> and<00:04:15.280> five

00:04:56.100 --> 00:05:04.310 
20 t9 is I 14 is n 21 is you five is e
and<00:04:58.850> four<00:04:59.850> is<00:05:00.180> d<00:05:02.240> so<00:05:03.240> a<00:05:03.270> simply<00:05:03.690> says<00:05:03.900> to<00:05:04.169> be

00:05:04.310 --> 00:05:04.320 
and four is d so a simply says to be

00:05:04.320 --> 00:05:05.659 
and four is d so a simply says to be
continued<00:05:04.830> which<00:05:05.039> kind<00:05:05.310> of<00:05:05.340> redundant

00:05:05.659 --> 00:05:05.669 
continued which kind of redundant

00:05:05.669 --> 00:05:07.159 
continued which kind of redundant
considering<00:05:06.389> that's<00:05:06.479> what's<00:05:06.720> on<00:05:06.840> the<00:05:06.930> screen

00:05:07.159 --> 00:05:07.169 
considering that's what's on the screen

00:05:07.169 --> 00:05:09.590 
considering that's what's on the screen
the<00:05:07.410> whole<00:05:07.440> time<00:05:07.850> during<00:05:08.850> the<00:05:09.000> credits<00:05:09.210> there

00:05:09.590 --> 00:05:09.600 
the whole time during the credits there

00:05:09.600 --> 00:05:11.659 
the whole time during the credits there
as<00:05:09.930> you<00:05:10.199> can<00:05:10.350> see<00:05:10.530> to<00:05:10.860> be<00:05:10.979> continued<00:05:11.430> and<00:05:11.550> then

00:05:11.659 --> 00:05:11.669 
as you can see to be continued and then

00:05:11.669 --> 00:05:13.010 
as you can see to be continued and then
right<00:05:11.789> under<00:05:12.000> it<00:05:12.090> it<00:05:12.180> says<00:05:12.360> to<00:05:12.510> be<00:05:12.630> continued

00:05:13.010 --> 00:05:13.020 
right under it it says to be continued

00:05:13.020 --> 00:05:17.180 
right under it it says to be continued
so<00:05:13.740> pretty<00:05:14.220> redundant<00:05:14.780> I<00:05:15.780> mean<00:05:16.590> they<00:05:17.039> really

00:05:17.180 --> 00:05:17.190 
so pretty redundant I mean they really

00:05:17.190 --> 00:05:18.800 
so pretty redundant I mean they really
could<00:05:17.430> have<00:05:17.460> done<00:05:17.669> something<00:05:17.880> better<00:05:18.150> instead

00:05:18.800 --> 00:05:18.810 
could have done something better instead

00:05:18.810 --> 00:05:21.080 
could have done something better instead
of<00:05:18.840> just<00:05:19.050> saying<00:05:19.169> the<00:05:19.320> same<00:05:19.500> thing<00:05:19.680> twice<00:05:20.090> but

00:05:21.080 --> 00:05:21.090 
of just saying the same thing twice but

00:05:21.090 --> 00:05:23.510 
of just saying the same thing twice but
I'm<00:05:21.270> yeah<00:05:22.080> really<00:05:22.590> interesting<00:05:23.160> episode<00:05:23.490> I
