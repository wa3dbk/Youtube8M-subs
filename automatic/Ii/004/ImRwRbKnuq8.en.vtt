00:00:00.890 --> 00:00:10.700
 Hey-how do you say generation time this time 

00:00:06.379 --> 00:00:15.680
 Jersey job is not a return of the duelist. 

00:00:10.700 --> 00:00:17.289
 After I finally bought the numbers street v Jump arrived 

00:00:15.680 --> 00:00:20.090
 Something 

00:00:17.289 --> 00:00:23.930
 I think let's received from Koch Kedoko Rette 

00:00:20.090 --> 00:00:28.870
 It wasn't a meeting on the 23rd 

00:00:23.930 --> 00:00:28.870
 I'm the best I'd have a two or today 

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:35.410
 23's Datta' only it was from the old mouth of today 

00:00:32.920 --> 00:00:37.290
 Anyway God 

00:00:35.410 --> 00:00:43.250
 It is a reward card 

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:46.780
 I do not understand the effect, but which child is stupid 

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:46.780
 Oh how it will come open 

00:00:48.790 --> 00:00:54.890
 This is it 

00:00:51.220 --> 00:01:01.730
 Unique Puppet Heavens Strings 

00:00:54.890 --> 00:01:04.010
 You need to be at level 8 and once you get rid of the volleyball to the Queen of the fields other than this card 

00:01:01.730 --> 00:01:08.210
 To all of the monsters display is also Te 

00:01:04.010 --> 00:01:12.650
 At the time of the end phase of the next opponent who puts one string counter 

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:14.820
 The number of monsters that destroyed return monster speakers string counter is riding 

00:01:12.650 --> 00:01:16.360
 Given the 500 points damage to apply 

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:17.740
 It is the effect of say 

00:01:16.360 --> 00:01:21.000
 Wow 

00:01:17.740 --> 00:01:25.260
 If it is a minute to use in blue and black 

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:28.650
 I feel like it 's better to have a Thunderend Dragon 

00:01:25.260 --> 00:01:32.310
 A little subtle Tcha is subtle by Well in 

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:37.710
 Gimmick puppets used by 4 

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:39.260
 I think the category of freak puppets seems to be behind if it comes out 

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:43.000
 Though 

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:47.200
 In v Jump Atlantal This is positive 

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:51.520
 I think that I do not read Well effect What everyone you Zonchi 

00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:55.750
 Well if you have one or two 

00:01:51.520 --> 00:02:01.060
 It may be a good feeling or it may be expensive 

00:01:55.750 --> 00:02:03.740
 Well so far if it is not necessary to build a dedicated deck with that one key of the drug or something, it is necessary 

00:02:01.060 --> 00:02:10.229
 There will be no card but 

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:12.160
 Well then let's open up 10 rounds, and let's see what we want. 

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:15.550
 c card itself Well 

00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:19.240

00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:25.570
 As we want to be made three 

00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:31.590
 One cylinder said 

00:02:29.020 --> 00:02:31.590
 It's also Kiri 

00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:40.330
 It's dangerous but I think it's good 

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:40.330
 Let's do it at home 

00:02:45.130 --> 00:02:49.530
 It can be said that Suko is like that 

00:02:48.569 --> 00:02:51.069

00:02:54.200 --> 00:03:00.340
 I went out somehow somehow 

00:02:57.260 --> 00:03:03.370
 I guess this is fine 

00:03:00.340 --> 00:03:05.610
 Pyramid of the Peer Gear 

00:03:03.370 --> 00:03:08.580
 It is Stonehenge and the troubled times 

00:03:05.610 --> 00:03:15.910

 No extra time for the day 

00:03:29.590 --> 00:03:35.350
 Shut in the Excalibur of Holo 

00:03:33.600 --> 00:03:36.650
 Memory and shuttle 

00:03:35.350 --> 00:03:38.569

 Paint 

00:03:43.990 --> 00:03:51.770
 Snatch on the view 

00:03:45.830 --> 00:03:57.710
 Was a open-minded of the forst of Ginrei of Chii 

00:03:51.770 --> 00:03:59.390

00:03:59.390 --> 00:04:04.400
 What a good result this is 

00:04:02.940 --> 00:04:08.840

 Babel also thinks that it is good to make it on making windows 

00:04:14.010 --> 00:04:23.370
 Well , I think the window will be strong if the cards increase in the future 

00:04:20.160 --> 00:04:29.529
 Because there is a good barbell doing a degree 

00:04:23.370 --> 00:04:34.509
 I'm not strong, so I'm following the Excalibur Yes 

00:04:29.529 --> 00:04:35.889
