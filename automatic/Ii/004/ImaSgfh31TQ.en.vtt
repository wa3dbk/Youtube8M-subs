00:00:08.960 --> 00:00:13.410
 and I hope you win or change 

00:00:11.849 --> 00:00:15.030
 on the back end up on clash of clan 

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:17.190
 for a 40 rider attack from 

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:19.650
 pig level 1 so we're going right now 

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:21.529
 searched for part of the search 

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:24.269
 opponents 

00:00:21.529 --> 00:00:26.460
 we will still try to find a 

00:00:24.269 --> 00:00:28.740
 pretty nice village with little 

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:37.530
 nearly a hundred thousand gold - wireless gold that 

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:39.800
 would be cool so 33000 no 24000 no 

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:39.800
 more 

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:53.850
 thirty seven thousand no more ah I come back 

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:56.010
 still 100 thousand twenty thousand no 29 

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:58.290
 yes no more so there are still two 

00:00:56.010 --> 00:01:03.930
 hundred of elixir but there I really 

00:00:58.290 --> 00:01:14.159
 129000 gold but I'm really going to 

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:19.920
 gold 54000 38 thousand or more 14000 no 

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:21.960
 over fifty three thousand years ago there is no 

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:25.410
 there's no more than 50 min finally ya 

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:29.369
 fifty awarded baud 88000 here is there 

00:01:25.410 --> 00:01:31.740
 88 miles yeah I 'll take 88 

00:01:29.369 --> 00:01:34.890
 it does not matter because there are particular 

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:36.240
 a lot of blood min so we go 

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:38.190
 tackle wet 80 

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:44.369
 I'm going to get you signed at once 

00:01:38.190 --> 00:01:45.690
 where I'm going to attack from here like that they 

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:49.140
 are going to deal with the mortar that are 

00:01:45.690 --> 00:01:51.240
 in front of and at least here will be more 

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:52.020
 than mortar to destroy so these 

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:54.720
 partics 3 2 1 

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:56.520
 aubry by nagging drizzle 40 days 

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:59.310
 people to pigs they left they 

00:01:56.520 --> 00:02:01.950
 go there they go and blabber thoroughly there 

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:02.399
 they are pointing eyes at both 

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:06.479
 mortar 

00:02:02.399 --> 00:02:09.929
 This is the first that people will mourn 

00:02:06.479 --> 00:02:13.980
 are gone this is the wizard's tower 

00:02:09.929 --> 00:02:15.510
 here and there little bomb in passing they stand 

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:17.430
 are divided into two squads 

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:22.950
 but I did not see the castle 

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:26.790
 clan it's there down there's nothing there 

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:29.130
 no defense so both rounds 

00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:32.400
 darche and it's good 1 it's good here 

00:02:29.130 --> 00:02:33.870
 so that's it, that's it, that's where it is 

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:37.350
 is going to do the 100% 

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:42.120
 so that's where the la la they fly 

00:02:37.350 --> 00:02:44.330
 they fly flying pigs up 

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:46.440
 rather city ​​hall 

00:02:44.330 --> 00:02:49.319
 and tackle the big resources 

00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:56.340
 left for tanks 

00:02:49.319 --> 00:03:01.970
 go go go I 'm like he stays 

00:02:56.340 --> 00:03:01.970
 about a dozen anyway 

00:03:04.430 --> 00:03:09.270
 they will be divided into two squads that 

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:12.600
 it is not bad frankly there is still 

00:03:09.270 --> 00:03:14.700
 two who flew away but that's it 

00:03:12.600 --> 00:03:18.590
 it's not bad at all with what 

00:03:14.700 --> 00:03:20.400
 splits into two squads it pays well 

00:03:18.590 --> 00:03:21.959
 like that can not be good actually 

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:23.810
 because if they divide sometimes they 

00:03:21.959 --> 00:03:25.650
 are dividing you have a big group that 

00:03:23.810 --> 00:03:28.709
 decidedly it addresses lille flies away 

00:03:25.650 --> 00:03:32.220
 and his face is completely trapped 

00:03:28.709 --> 00:03:33.780
 so here's the thing it's the battle of 

00:03:32.220 --> 00:03:35.370
 also there it goes down it will because, 

00:03:33.780 --> 00:03:37.440
 does they leave all regroup and 

00:03:35.370 --> 00:03:38.880
 then we had two of you left so 

00:03:37.440 --> 00:03:41.160
 it's not for example for theirs and 

00:03:38.880 --> 00:03:42.600
 laura barbarians but at the same time this 

00:03:41.160 --> 00:03:46.230
 you can easily lose 

00:03:42.600 --> 00:03:48.450
 troops stupidly that's it's it depends 

00:03:46.230 --> 00:03:53.239
 really it depends on the attacks 

00:03:48.450 --> 00:03:57.360
 So here victory over 88 gold in 1796 125 

00:03:53.239 --> 00:03:59.010
 1459 elixir 180 black elixir and for 

00:03:57.360 --> 00:04:02.040
 finish 26 trophies at the end 

00:03:59.010 --> 00:04:04.620
 so we're going back here we go I'm going 

00:04:02.040 --> 00:04:06.150
 back it means a little bit so 

00:04:04.620 --> 00:04:08.130
 so here I hope that this attack of 

00:04:06.150 --> 00:04:08.910
 Rider two pigs level 1 you 

00:04:08.130 --> 00:04:11.280
 will have pleased 

00:04:08.910 --> 00:04:12.320
 the next attack I do not know about 

00:04:11.280 --> 00:04:14.850
 what will be so I will think about it 

00:04:12.320 --> 00:04:16.459
 propose at least ten attacks in the 

00:04:14.850 --> 00:04:19.739
 comments sorry if you want to see 

00:04:16.459 --> 00:04:20.870
 the bows at the archers attacked 

00:04:19.739 --> 00:04:26.070
 giants 

00:04:20.870 --> 00:04:27.930
 for info I have 200 places here I have 200 

00:04:26.070 --> 00:04:29.700
 places so that's if you want to 

00:04:27.930 --> 00:04:31.530
 see a particular troop say the 

00:04:29.700 --> 00:04:34.410
 me in the comments and me on this 

00:04:31.530 --> 00:04:36.620
