00:00:00.620 --> 00:00:05.609
 individuals with you milk and melkco 

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:07.830
 and if you have a box 360 which doesn't 

00:00:05.609 --> 00:00:10.590
 games are displayed then you hit by 

00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:12.719
 I will show you now how to solve 

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:15.059
 This problem to start you need 

00:00:12.719 --> 00:00:16.980
 convince say make sure you have 

00:00:15.059 --> 00:00:19.320
 worth the freeboot because if he doesn't 

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:21.810
 worth then you can't just like that 

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:23.970
 take download game install it on 

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:26.640
 hard drive and enjoy gaming 

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:29.730
 the process is not only to have this privilege 

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:32.369
 owners rebut and if after all he you 

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:34.670
 then you need to do the following 

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:38.610
 you go to so things 

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:40.340
 Further content so things i go to 

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:43.020
 manage mts section 

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:45.360
 so you will have a slightly different tablet 

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:49.140
 here is such you click czech 

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:51.180
 bitch or write like here at all 

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:53.160
 will be different so here personally 

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:55.739
 I still have a sofa folder someone can 

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:56.129
 be just and eat from someone can 

00:00:55.739 --> 00:00:59.280
 be 

00:00:56.129 --> 00:01:01.350
 hd2 someone may have a hard disk 

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:03.120
 so all you need to do is 

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:06.659
 go to the folder where you are 

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:09.210
 install games anyway this 

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:13.830
 content folder with all zeros 

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:16.080
 going in on it you press the y button here 

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:18.900
 all she took this directory 

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:21.180
 set and and then if you have here 

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:23.340
 there are some ticks you need them 

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:27.720
 shoot and tick only 

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:31.409
 automatic then press the x button 

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:34.920
 site here and you can safely return to 

00:01:31.409 --> 00:01:37.770
 a section with games and check are displayed 

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:38.490
 whether or not they will see games 

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:41.340
 are displayed 

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:43.590
 I also want to notice that many 

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:45.149
 freeboot users and which ones are allowed 

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:48.350
 error here they set 

00:01:45.149 --> 00:01:50.720
 and the game goes into the games section and 

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:53.970
 discovers something like that 

00:01:50.720 --> 00:01:56.759
 the absence of this game is the whole thing 

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:59.280
 the fact that when you need to boot 

00:01:56.759 --> 00:02:02.610
 overwrite your data and so if 

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:04.770
 you installed the game you do not need a couple of times 

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:06.479
 press the button b that is not just like that 

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:08.849
 take back like i just 

00:02:06.479 --> 00:02:11.580
 returned supplies set the paths and 

00:02:08.849 --> 00:02:12.750
 solved this problem with the lack of games you 

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:17.180
 need to click on more 

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:20.970
 and the guide button is like this 

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:23.370
 restart the console your kind bars 

00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:29.190
 if you allow just restart as if 

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:31.740
 menu also if you click on the right 

00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:34.560
 stick here for example I have 16 gigabytes 

00:02:31.740 --> 00:02:37.260
 free if I go to the section with 

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:38.130
 games delete the game that weighs for example 

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:40.709
 7 gigabytes 

00:02:38.130 --> 00:02:42.200
 here and immediately click again on the right 

00:02:40.709 --> 00:02:45.480
 I will still see the stick 

00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:48.270
 16 gigabytes until i 

00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:50.580
 reboot into this menu until freeboot 

00:02:48.270 --> 00:02:53.000
 Perry will collect all the data that only 

00:02:50.580 --> 00:02:57.480

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:59.280
