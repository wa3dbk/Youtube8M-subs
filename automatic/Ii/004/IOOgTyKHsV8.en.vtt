 traveling on the only passenger train 

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:31.199
 Diary left in Brazil 

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:37.050

 the taxi driver dear our adventure is crazy 

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:49.500
 too much for speed 

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:51.719
 He could also have vacationed in the 

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:55.860
 and was glazed on the three of there

 france training la gaceta pain is a lot 

00:00:55.860 --> 00:01:00.989
 speed and I know I did not feel 

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:03.809
 absolutely nothing 

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:06.570
 you create a like that speaks a field 

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:08.550
 magnetic field and it does not 

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:11.340

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:17.130
 sir, without knowing the taxi driver speaks of a 

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:19.680
 German train levitating on a field 

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:24.000
 formed on the rails travels to the 

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:25.320
 today at 430 kilometers per hour and 

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:26.970
 must enter into government competition 

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:30.950
 for a high-speed train 

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:33.450
 linking river sao paulo and meadows 

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:36.410
 but the train that appears on the 

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:41.120
 Road travels slow like no old car 

00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:41.120
 and that 's where we go in the morning 

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:50.740
 the train departs without delay and 76 goes 

00:01:49.210 --> 00:01:54.670
 showing the city from an angle that the 

00:01:50.740 --> 00:01:58.110
 people rarely see between belo horizonte 

00:01:54.670 --> 00:02:02.770
 and cariacica in the holy spirit will be 

00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:05.500
 664 kilometers carrying 57 cars with 

00:02:02.770 --> 00:02:07.810
 the average of 51 kilometers per hour 

00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:09.670
 the locomotive will take 13 hours to 

00:02:07.810 --> 00:02:11.770
 reach the destination 

00:02:09.670 --> 00:02:14.080
 there was a time when the train was a luxury 

00:02:11.770 --> 00:02:16.209
 so popular in Brazil that it took 100 

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:18.580
 million passengers per year 

00:02:16.209 --> 00:02:20.620
 equivalent of buses or airplanes . 

00:02:18.580 --> 00:02:23.980
 nowadays but it was there in the century 

00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:26.590
 past until the 1960s 

00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:28.600
 today I have last stayed for 

00:02:26.590 --> 00:02:31.570
 force of a privatization contract with 

00:02:28.600 --> 00:02:34.380
 the valley takes just over 900 thousand 

00:02:31.570 --> 00:02:34.380
 per year 

00:02:35.770 --> 00:02:41.590
 What are we seeing? What happens? 

00:02:37.930 --> 00:02:44.350
 when there is train supply 

00:02:41.590 --> 00:02:46.810
 population is just how many people here 

00:02:44.350 --> 00:02:48.940
 action the governor singing in the 

00:02:46.810 --> 00:02:53.320
 training that is now going toward 

00:02:48.940 --> 00:02:55.030
 win in queue to enter but not have 

00:02:53.320 --> 00:02:57.580
 to pee here or go through the 

00:02:55.030 --> 00:02:59.440
 X-rays as airports have also 

00:02:57.580 --> 00:03:05.110
 no concern about the excess of 

00:02:59.440 --> 00:03:07.360
 baggage or congestion and where the 

00:03:05.110 --> 00:03:11.020
 train sits squatter 

00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:13.510
 I know many people who would like it 

00:03:11.020 --> 00:03:15.740
 No one is going to stay alone in the place and in the 

00:03:13.510 --> 00:03:18.080
 debut 

00:03:15.740 --> 00:03:19.820
 in more than three decades that the psychologist 

00:03:18.080 --> 00:03:20.810
 makes this journey to visit the 

00:03:19.820 --> 00:03:22.670
 relatives 

00:03:20.810 --> 00:03:27.170
 she likes to travel like that in a wagon and 

00:03:22.670 --> 00:03:31.250
 the other looking at the landscape will see the 

00:03:27.170 --> 00:03:34.250
 rivers in the fields of mining cities 

00:03:31.250 --> 00:03:36.860
 neighbors stuck in the railroad 

00:03:34.250 --> 00:03:39.020
 and finds everything here is better than one 

00:03:36.860 --> 00:03:46.940
 airplane 

00:03:39.020 --> 00:03:50.500
 there to the corridor and wagon talk 

00:03:46.940 --> 00:03:57.550
 restaurant are exclusive to the train 

00:03:50.500 --> 00:04:02.260
 to claim the rice tropeiro beans 

00:03:57.550 --> 00:04:06.830
 chicken salad 

00:04:02.260 --> 00:04:14.530
 without rain on the next station plus one 

00:04:06.830 --> 00:04:17.930
 stop ore coming against the hand 

00:04:14.530 --> 00:04:20.709
 and the evening that looks much more beautiful 

00:04:17.930 --> 00:04:20.709
 by the train window 

00:04:21.079 --> 00:04:24.350
 after 13 hours almost reaching the 

00:04:23.510 --> 00:04:31.010
 victory 

00:04:24.350 --> 00:04:33.950
 I do not remember the taxi driver and I disagree 

00:04:31.010 --> 00:04:36.710
 to fully travel the slower wagon 

00:04:33.950 --> 00:04:47.300
 that has 30 years of history but 

00:04:36.710 --> 00:04:49.430
 no one complains here i can not care 

00:04:47.300 --> 00:04:51.640
 find it even better that the 

00:04:49.430 --> 00:04:51.640
 bus 

00:04:52.980 --> 00:04:58.290
 is in the most comfortable class 

00:04:56.010 --> 00:05:01.260
 We traveled in Brazil from before. 

00:04:58.290 --> 00:05:04.800
 thinking of the one who can come in the future 

00:05:01.260 --> 00:05:06.060
 after all, at another speed and many 

00:05:04.800 --> 00:05:07.430
 other routes 

00:05:06.060 --> 00:05:10.830
 our country of continental dimensions 

00:05:07.430 --> 00:05:11.640
 can still find the way of the 

00:05:10.830 --> 00:05:15.740
 rails 

00:05:11.640 --> 00:05:15.740
 open what you want to stop
