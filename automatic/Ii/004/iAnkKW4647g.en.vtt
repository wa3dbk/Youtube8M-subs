00:00:06.589 --> 00:00:09.589
 i 

00:00:23.420 --> 00:00:30.360
 How about youtube friends how are you? 

00:00:27.690 --> 00:00:34.200
 I hope it is very good and I bring you a 

00:00:30.360 --> 00:00:36.720
 shorter gameplay but it's very useful already 

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:39.360
 that when they play 

00:00:36.720 --> 00:00:41.720
 in this part of chalk 

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:45.030
 this 

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:47.640
 you have to get on those terrains 

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:49.360
 and as you know with the hunter very very 

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:51.610
 hard 

00:00:49.360 --> 00:00:53.460
 and here I bring with the class of 

00:00:51.610 --> 00:00:56.700
 gunman 

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:58.290
 in which are the improvements this combat 

00:00:56.700 --> 00:01:01.920
 speed 

00:00:58.290 --> 00:01:04.030
 and they have all the attributes since this one 

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:07.110
 has more 

00:01:04.030 --> 00:01:07.110
 more agility 

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:13.880
 and well the one also right now I'm 

00:01:10.789 --> 00:01:17.540
 watching to pass it easily with 

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:21.380
 the sword me here active 

00:01:17.540 --> 00:01:25.570
 let's see then the hunters 

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:28.479
 with those who take longer to arrive 

00:01:25.570 --> 00:01:33.630
 the titan is the one that has the most jump 

00:01:28.479 --> 00:01:33.630
 high and arrives in the easiest way 

00:01:36.820 --> 00:01:42.340
 and the sorcerer also because if he 's in 

00:01:39.250 --> 00:01:46.440
 the age of the sun can be revived good 

00:01:42.340 --> 00:01:46.440
 we must jump there we are going to put 

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:51.310
 up there and like a filter 

00:01:52.570 --> 00:02:00.659
 is like you see here there is a small finite 

00:01:56.320 --> 00:02:00.659
 where we put that grenade and now 

00:02:01.060 --> 00:02:07.470
 on this side that does not happen to me 

00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:10.700
 minimum 

00:02:07.470 --> 00:02:14.349
 again let's try 

00:02:10.700 --> 00:02:14.349
 equal to filito 

00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:21.210
 what do I fall 

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:26.050
 we will be 

00:02:27.569 --> 00:02:31.219
 now up there 

00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:37.760
 up easy now there 

00:02:42.100 --> 00:02:50.070
 now here 

00:02:45.220 --> 00:02:50.070
 well here is the most complicated part 

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:58.670
 but I think that with just going up here 

00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:58.670
 disappear are not to see 

00:03:14.959 --> 00:03:20.030
 I do not give birth 

00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:27.680
 over here while I tried to climb 

00:03:25.470 --> 00:03:27.680
 here 

00:03:28.360 --> 00:03:31.110
 to this one 

00:03:31.660 --> 00:03:37.280
 as you can see we are already in this part 

00:03:35.360 --> 00:03:40.140
 so I think that this is where 

00:03:37.280 --> 00:03:42.230
 disappear there is 

00:03:40.140 --> 00:03:46.150
 how do you see friends 

00:03:42.230 --> 00:03:46.150
 we could disappear 

00:03:48.380 --> 00:03:54.110
 now the joke is just to make the bridge 

00:03:51.610 --> 00:03:57.110
 and could you guys know any 

00:03:54.110 --> 00:03:58.650
 way not since I've never tried 

00:03:57.110 --> 00:04:02.989
 single 

00:03:58.650 --> 00:04:02.989
 I have always come with someone 

00:04:09.850 --> 00:04:13.140
 this is a form but 

00:04:26.800 --> 00:04:31.470
 I never nail good friends I hope you 

00:04:29.349 --> 00:04:34.470
 have liked and see you in the next 

00:04:31.470 --> 00:04:34.470
 goodbye
