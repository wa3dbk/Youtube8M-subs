00:05:54.980 --> 00:05:59.450
 on what reads here that she can't 

00:05:57.350 --> 00:06:02.030
 find because i was carrying a base 

00:05:59.450 --> 00:06:04.010
 data searches russia but nonetheless 

00:06:02.030 --> 00:06:06.919
 she finds some restaurants some 

00:06:04.010 --> 00:06:10.340
 eatery node at least found 

00:06:06.919 --> 00:06:13.220
 here I don’t know why but anyway 

00:06:10.340 --> 00:06:15.710
 you know it works well enough 

00:06:13.220 --> 00:06:18.169
 despite the fact that this is the first beta I 

00:06:15.710 --> 00:06:20.960
 I mean you are not with 8.3 

00:06:18.169 --> 00:06:23.810
 first beta for russian siri and know 

00:06:20.960 --> 00:06:26.030
 it works very, very passable and 

00:06:23.810 --> 00:06:27.950
 really commendable that guys from apple 

00:06:26.030 --> 00:06:30.650
 finally began to develop Russian 

00:06:27.950 --> 00:06:32.870
 Syria and know despite the fact that it 

00:06:30.650 --> 00:06:35.810
 puts like that wrong stress there 

00:06:32.870 --> 00:06:38.390
 same thing giving and off or something else 

00:06:35.810 --> 00:06:41.000
 like that despite all this even that 

00:06:38.390 --> 00:06:44.419
 she has some computer voice yes 

00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:46.340
 anyway and opal to release 83 or 82 this 

00:06:44.419 --> 00:06:48.590
 all naturally corrected and therefore not 

00:06:46.340 --> 00:06:50.810
 It is worth overestimating now 

00:06:48.590 --> 00:06:52.700
 straight strictly but with her tasks she 

00:06:50.810 --> 00:06:54.500
 copes call can note 

00:06:52.700 --> 00:06:56.660
 write can set alarm 

00:06:54.500 --> 00:06:58.669
 and all that, she naturally can and this 

00:06:56.660 --> 00:07:00.740
 very happy actually now 

00:06:58.669 --> 00:07:02.960
 or actually finally Russian 

00:07:00.740 --> 00:07:05.060
 Siri has come therefore it remains to wait while 

00:07:02.960 --> 00:07:07.190
 our guys are from cupertino and and drank up 

00:07:05.060 --> 00:07:08.960
 here is such a prom.ua condition 

00:07:07.190 --> 00:07:11.720
 but therefore it only remains to wait and 

00:07:08.960 --> 00:07:14.390
 Syria's work can be assessed on solid 

00:07:11.720 --> 00:07:16.100
 Four plus no said it for sure 

00:07:14.390 --> 00:07:17.930
