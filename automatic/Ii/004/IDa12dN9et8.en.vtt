00:07:19.630 --> 00:07:19.640 
so basically that's why I think I should

00:07:19.640 --> 00:07:21.220 
so basically that's why I think I should
join<00:07:19.790> phases<00:07:20.240> because<00:07:20.390> I<00:07:20.570> think<00:07:20.840> of<00:07:20.960> all<00:07:21.080> the

00:07:21.220 --> 00:07:21.230 
join phases because I think of all the

00:07:21.230 --> 00:07:21.950 
join phases because I think of all the
accolades

00:07:21.950 --> 00:07:21.960 
accolades

00:07:21.960 --> 00:07:24.170
