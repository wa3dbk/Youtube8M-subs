00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:15.300 
move those little bones to where I would

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:18.320 
move those little bones to where I would
like<00:02:15.540> them<00:02:15.750> to<00:02:15.900> be<00:02:16.110> and<00:02:16.620> that<00:02:17.250> splint<00:02:17.880> really

00:02:18.320 --> 00:02:18.330 
like them to be and that splint really

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:20.210 
like them to be and that splint really
should<00:02:18.540> stay<00:02:18.810> on<00:02:18.840> for<00:02:19.230> the<00:02:19.260> week<00:02:19.500> I<00:02:19.740> usually

00:02:20.210 --> 00:02:20.220 
should stay on for the week I usually

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:23.930 
should stay on for the week I usually
ask<00:02:20.400> you<00:02:20.760> not<00:02:21.240> to<00:02:21.540> take<00:02:21.780> a<00:02:22.560> shower<00:02:22.980> to<00:02:23.550> get<00:02:23.700> that

rhinoplasty<00:02:30.620> which<00:02:31.620> really<00:02:31.890> allows<00:02:32.220> me<00:02:32.250> to

00:02:32.630 --> 00:02:32.640 
rhinoplasty which really allows me to

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:34.490 
rhinoplasty which really allows me to
get<00:02:32.760> the<00:02:32.940> most<00:02:33.209> precise<00:02:33.720> results<00:02:34.290> that<00:02:34.410> I

00:02:34.490 --> 00:02:34.500 
get the most precise results that I

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:36.800 
get the most precise results that I
humanly<00:02:34.950> can<00:02:35.070> get<00:02:35.310> those<00:02:36.060> sutures<00:02:36.420> are

00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:36.810 
humanly can get those sutures are

00:02:36.810 --> 00:02:39.170 
humanly can get those sutures are
removed<00:02:36.840> at<00:02:37.470> a<00:02:37.500> week<00:02:37.770> as<00:02:38.010> I<00:02:38.490> said<00:02:38.730> at<00:02:38.880> the<00:02:38.910> end

00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:39.180 
removed at a week as I said at the end
