00:00:03.140 --> 00:00:07.410
 hello my name is Dorothea I give 

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:08.580
 courses at photo ap 

00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:11.280
 and today I'm going to show you 

00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:13.559
 how to photograph an object 

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:15.540
 on a white background thanks to a box 

00:00:13.559 --> 00:00:17.430
 homemade light then photographed 

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:19.500
 an object on a white background it can be 

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:21.359
 quite useful both when we want 

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:23.039
 highlight an object for example the 

00:00:21.359 --> 00:00:25.320
 put on sale on the internet we do not see 

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:27.689
 that the object is it is not ultimately 

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:29.580
 in a jumble of things behind he's 

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:31.410
 really highlighted and it can be 

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:34.200
 also useful actually to be able to 

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:36.540
 proceed with a clipping and 

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:38.280
 they are imported the reintegrate into a 

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:39.510
 other photo then a light box that 

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:41.219
 can be bought in the trade on 

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:42.629
 find like that mini studio that 

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:45.329
 can have all the 

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:47.640
 sizes possible from very small 

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:49.890
 finally 20 cm to photograph 

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:51.539
 even jewels from tiny objects to 

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:54.270
 very big tents finally for 

00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:56.129
 photograph for example furniture on 

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:59.070
 can also finally quite easily 

00:00:56.129 --> 00:01:02.489
 manufacture it cheaply finally 

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:04.619
 by taking a cardboard box all 

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:07.860
 simple of the desired size of 

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:09.420
 spreadsheets of tracing paper a 

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:13.080
 Canson leaf that will serve you 

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:15.299
 finally to do the cyclo so the bottom 

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:17.520
 white who will not see art is behind 

00:01:15.299 --> 00:01:18.900
 who is going to be bent like this and me in 

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:21.900
 the in the light box 

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:24.030
 and then you will need some more 

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:26.460
 lighting small bedside lamp 

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:28.380
 small spots are enough so once 

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:29.820
 you made your light box 

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:31.979
 with your carton you can 

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:34.619
 positioned inside the objects that 

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:36.600
 wanted to photograph and we will place 

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:38.280
 the lights so as I told you 

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:40.650
 you can take here the man of 

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:43.079
 bedside small spot really what you 

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:45.119
 have at home you finally go 

00:01:43.079 --> 00:01:46.560
 bright on both sides it's important 

00:01:45.119 --> 00:01:49.140
 effectively so that there is no 

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:51.750
 to decrease the shadows to position 

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:53.880
 the lights on both sides of the 

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:55.649
 light box eventually from my 

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:57.600
 third a third light at 

00:01:55.649 --> 00:01:58.390
 on top like that you'll have a good background 

00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:00.790
 enlightened 

00:01:58.390 --> 00:02:02.140
 white is not shaded the objects the 

00:02:00.790 --> 00:02:04.450
 objects will not have many wore 

00:02:02.140 --> 00:02:06.250
 So once your mini studio 

00:02:04.450 --> 00:02:08.679
 installed you can take the picture 

00:02:06.250 --> 00:02:10.479
 if you have the opportunity to adjust the 

00:02:08.679 --> 00:02:11.250
 balance of white plans on your 

00:02:10.479 --> 00:02:14.170
 apparatus 

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:16.150
 go ahead actually you have to 

00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:17.830
 can finally find the sheet 

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:20.470
 white to the white appear 

00:02:17.830 --> 00:02:22.480
 really and possibly overexposed a 

00:02:20.470 --> 00:02:26.820
 little bit your photo to have a 

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:26.820
 fund a very white fund 

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:36.910
 and so here we realized a photo 

00:02:34.239 --> 00:02:40.830
 of objects on a completely white background 

00:02:36.910 --> 00:02:40.830
 where we finally only see the objects
