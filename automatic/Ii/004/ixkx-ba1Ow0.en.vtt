 This place is at night and the staff 

00:00:56.980 --> 00:01:03.420
 Steal to jump the queue because

 very dangerous place and has many 

00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:35.080
 many drivers who do not have 

00:01:32.170 --> 00:01:39.960
 aware of this was not only want 

00:01:35.080 --> 00:01:46.990
 is accelerating and the movement is both 

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:49.080
 as a vehicle and a truck in the 

00:01:46.990 --> 00:01:49.080
 highway 

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:56.440
 there in line there was a stop but more 

00:01:53.830 --> 00:02:01.090
 here is the best known and the curve of the 

00:01:56.440 --> 00:02:03.170
 Japanese and staff commenting on the 

00:02:01.090 --> 00:02:06.470
 radio search 

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:10.550
 good passion fruit path 

00:02:06.470 --> 00:02:12.530
 we are already in goes leaving with caution 

00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:15.140
 The epsilon my trip starts at 

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:17.989
 guarulhos são paulo 

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:21.010
 I conclude her in bento gonçalves

 Rio Grande do Sul 

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:29.260
 around 

00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:33.940
 look at the truck movement 

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:36.600
 the former shirt 1 whose truck is raining 

00:02:33.940 --> 00:02:36.600
 but only 

00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:44.080
 have to keep a distance had to 

00:02:40.989 --> 00:02:45.790
 need at times from stop 

00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:48.909
 and there's space for 

00:02:45.790 --> 00:02:54.700
 power to stop if no slide slips 

00:02:48.909 --> 00:02:58.090
 Eight of the times, it 's a lot of recklessness. 

00:02:54.700 --> 00:03:00.500
 and personnel and an accident happens that 

00:02:58.090 --> 00:03:03.460
 I was 

00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:05.660
 close the plugs carefully and 

00:03:03.460 --> 00:03:08.380
 head of the assistance that could be 

00:03:05.660 --> 00:03:08.380
 avoided right 

00:03:08.870 --> 00:03:18.120
 has been published here for 40 per 

00:03:13.640 --> 00:03:19.990
 time when the engine brake 

00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:21.880
 ah 

00:03:19.990 --> 00:03:23.800
 the truck even offers me a certain 

00:03:21.880 --> 00:03:26.640
 huge security do not take care of it 

00:03:23.800 --> 00:03:26.640
 becomes a weapon 

00:03:27.110 --> 00:03:31.820
 and with them they are not aware day 6 

00:03:29.990 --> 00:03:34.460
 It's very professional and very 

00:03:31.820 --> 00:03:41.090
 driver has many more 

00:03:34.460 --> 00:03:47.800
 lack of qualification is on the floor of 

00:03:41.090 --> 00:03:52.550
 top of the mountain with 90 state of são paulo 

00:03:47.800 --> 00:03:57.770
 the best known and regis that there is 

00:03:52.550 --> 00:03:59.890
 having 116 flow is intense until the capital 

00:03:57.770 --> 00:03:59.890
 curitiba 

00:04:00.320 --> 00:04:07.450
 there personal and adult having more vision or 

00:04:05.390 --> 00:04:09.920
 less around 

00:04:07.450 --> 00:04:13.790
 Our family is so good and with the shell of 

00:04:09.920 --> 00:04:15.970
 passion fruit have already needed here because I 

00:04:13.790 --> 00:04:20.070
 Tell me 

00:04:15.970 --> 00:04:20.070
 that's it hinders punk base 

00:04:21.450 --> 00:04:28.719
 there the people on both sides 

00:04:25.360 --> 00:04:35.789
 had a base that's it the 

00:04:28.719 --> 00:04:35.789
 staff comes as the load is complicated 

00:04:37.630 --> 00:04:44.880
 it will only go out mentally but that happens is 

00:04:43.030 --> 00:04:49.350
 followed 

00:04:44.880 --> 00:04:52.520
 What is that even the raining is not so 

00:04:49.350 --> 00:04:56.610
 You do not have to queue. 

00:04:52.520 --> 00:04:57.450
 for a reason could be avoided in the 

00:04:56.610 --> 00:05:00.840
 accident 

00:04:57.450 --> 00:05:02.850
 suck this for 

00:05:00.840 --> 00:05:04.200
 she has been known to happen already this 

00:05:02.850 --> 00:05:08.250
 kind of thing 

00:05:04.200 --> 00:05:10.940
 well look at this beast well and wet well 

00:05:08.250 --> 00:05:10.940
 marked 

00:05:10.980 --> 00:05:17.950
 but with reggae it's easy but more looks 

00:05:15.240 --> 00:05:22.900
 transit to 

00:05:17.950 --> 00:05:25.170
 here 's after the Japanese in personal calls 

00:05:22.900 --> 00:05:25.170
 morning 

00:05:25.560 --> 00:05:29.900
 the most support point for automobiles 

00:05:31.660 --> 00:05:36.460
 in guiana 

00:05:33.810 --> 00:05:41.979
 I was even going to overtake 

00:05:36.460 --> 00:05:45.250
 no flight to maintain safety and maintaining 

00:05:41.979 --> 00:05:47.620
 the security to be able to do this 

00:05:45.250 --> 00:05:54.100
 crossing is over is a crossing here 

00:05:47.620 --> 00:05:59.220
 because the 90- degree saw is a simple 

00:05:54.100 --> 00:05:59.220
 canatiba afterwards it is published 

00:05:59.560 --> 00:06:04.710
 oh look how much that traffic 

00:06:02.500 --> 00:06:04.710
 heavy 

00:06:06.200 --> 00:06:13.550
 has stopped again that there is a way 

00:06:09.800 --> 00:06:16.030
 a bottleneck that this bottleneck goes from one to 

00:06:13.550 --> 00:06:16.030
 not right 

00:06:17.689 --> 00:06:21.940
 Hague 

00:06:19.300 --> 00:06:26.220
 stopped gave no passage for me not 

00:06:21.940 --> 00:06:26.220
 can make it difficult 

00:06:26.470 --> 00:06:30.420
 looks just leaving the opposite direction 

00:06:30.900 --> 00:06:36.229
 It's complicated, huh? 

00:06:33.529 --> 00:06:39.909
 he is already saying so of the band 

00:06:36.229 --> 00:06:39.909
 additional 300 meters 

00:06:41.080 --> 00:06:46.030
 It will happen at the end of another one there. 

00:06:43.930 --> 00:06:47.560
 you become aware of what is happening in 

00:06:46.030 --> 00:06:49.659
 road right 

00:06:47.560 --> 00:06:52.139
 A good table, and here's the way of the 

00:06:49.659 --> 00:06:52.139
 Brazil
