so sometime and it I advertising title

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:47.810 
so sometime and it I advertising title
can<00:01:45.299> be<00:01:45.500> misleading<00:01:46.500> so<00:01:46.799> those<00:01:47.009> are<00:01:47.250> 10<00:01:47.520> plus

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:47.820 
can be misleading so those are 10 plus

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:53.660 
can be misleading so those are 10 plus
10<00:01:48.119> 20<00:01:48.770> that<00:01:49.770> in<00:01:50.189> total<00:01:51.350> it's<00:01:52.350> a<00:01:52.649> up<00:01:53.280> to<00:01:53.340> 10

00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:53.670 
10 20 that in total it's a up to 10

of<00:01:56.909> the<00:01:57.600> power<00:01:57.750> consumption<00:01:59.030> so<00:02:00.030> the<00:02:00.240> color<00:02:00.450> is

00:02:01.539 --> 00:02:01.549 
of the power consumption so the color is

00:03:41.380 --> 00:03:41.390 
is in those resistors the first

00:03:41.390 --> 00:03:45.880 
is in those resistors the first
generation<00:03:42.019> resistors<00:03:43.989> not<00:03:44.989> majority<00:03:45.709> but

00:03:45.880 --> 00:03:45.890 
generation resistors not majority but

00:03:45.890 --> 00:03:50.350 
generation resistors not majority but
let's<00:03:46.610> say<00:03:46.850> 10%<00:03:47.829> they<00:03:48.829> get<00:03:49.070> overheated<00:03:49.610> so

00:03:50.350 --> 00:03:50.360 
let's say 10% they get overheated so

00:03:50.360 --> 00:03:54.550 
let's say 10% they get overheated so
this<00:03:50.570> is<00:03:50.720> this<00:03:51.709> is<00:03:51.860> a<00:03:52.100> faulty<00:03:52.579> one<00:03:52.760> I<00:03:53.560> just

00:03:54.550 --> 00:03:54.560 
this is this is a faulty one I just

00:03:54.560 --> 00:03:57.250 
this is this is a faulty one I just
disassembled<00:03:55.310> and<00:03:55.760> here<00:03:56.480> you<00:03:56.720> can<00:03:56.870> see<00:03:57.110> it's

00:03:57.250 --> 00:03:57.260 
disassembled and here you can see it's

00:03:57.260 --> 00:04:01.119 
disassembled and here you can see it's
melted<00:03:57.829> overheated<00:03:58.519> and<00:03:59.510> it's<00:03:59.690> only

00:04:01.119 --> 00:04:01.129 
melted overheated and it's only

00:04:01.129 --> 00:04:06.729 
melted overheated and it's only
it's<00:04:01.489> only<00:04:01.989> consists<00:04:02.989> of<00:04:03.109> one<00:04:03.319> resistor<00:04:05.739> very

00:04:06.729 --> 00:04:06.739 
it's only consists of one resistor very

00:04:06.739 --> 00:04:12.129 
it's only consists of one resistor very
small<00:04:07.340> connector<00:04:07.879> and<00:04:10.450> the<00:04:11.450> connector<00:04:11.900> to

00:04:12.129 --> 00:04:12.139 
small connector and the connector to

00:04:12.139 --> 00:04:16.900 
small connector and the connector to
your<00:04:12.349> car<00:04:13.569> male<00:04:15.100> connector<00:04:16.100> flat<00:04:16.459> connector

your car male connector flat connector
so<00:04:17.810> the<00:04:18.229> the<00:04:18.650> bulb<00:04:18.829> itself<00:04:19.190> the

00:04:19.839 --> 00:04:19.849 
so the the bulb itself the

00:04:19.849 --> 00:04:22.600 
so the the bulb itself the
first-generation<00:04:20.419> they<00:04:21.410> were<00:04:21.560> they<00:04:21.919> are<00:04:22.099> as

00:04:22.600 --> 00:04:22.610 
first-generation they were they are as

00:04:22.610 --> 00:04:26.020 
first-generation they were they are as
good<00:04:23.060> as<00:04:23.210> those<00:04:23.419> ones<00:04:24.009> the<00:04:25.009> this<00:04:25.460> is<00:04:25.639> made<00:04:25.820> by

00:04:26.020 --> 00:04:26.030 
good as those ones the this is made by

00:04:26.030 --> 00:04:29.159 
good as those ones the this is made by
different<00:04:26.479> factories<00:04:26.870> but<00:04:27.259> the<00:04:27.770> cree<00:04:28.729> LED

00:04:29.159 --> 00:04:29.169 
different factories but the cree LED

00:04:29.169 --> 00:04:32.560 
different factories but the cree LED
chip<00:04:30.169> here<00:04:30.830> is<00:04:30.979> the<00:04:31.160> same<00:04:31.400> and<00:04:31.669> construction

00:04:32.560 --> 00:04:32.570 
chip here is the same and construction

00:04:32.570 --> 00:04:35.320 
chip here is the same and construction
is<00:04:32.710> same<00:04:33.710> both<00:04:34.099> high<00:04:34.610> product<00:04:35.000> donor

00:04:35.320 --> 00:04:35.330 
is same both high product donor

00:04:35.330 --> 00:04:38.710 
is same both high product donor
differences<00:04:35.990> the<00:04:36.680> first-generation<00:04:37.720> maybe

00:04:38.710 --> 00:04:38.720 
differences the first-generation maybe

00:04:38.720 --> 00:04:41.189 
differences the first-generation maybe
because<00:04:39.590> they<00:04:39.740> didn't<00:04:39.979> have<00:04:40.160> any<00:04:40.370> experience

00:04:41.189 --> 00:04:41.199 
because they didn't have any experience

00:04:41.199 --> 00:04:45.719 
because they didn't have any experience
those<00:04:42.520> we<00:04:43.520> had<00:04:43.669> problems<00:04:44.150> like<00:04:44.750> 1<00:04:45.050> out<00:04:45.289> of<00:04:45.320> 10

00:04:45.719 --> 00:04:45.729 
those we had problems like 1 out of 10

00:04:45.729 --> 00:04:51.339 
those we had problems like 1 out of 10
so<00:04:47.800> now<00:04:48.800> we<00:04:48.860> find<00:04:49.720> different<00:04:50.720> factories

00:04:51.339 --> 00:04:51.349 
so now we find different factories

00:04:51.349 --> 00:04:56.290 
so now we find different factories
likely<00:04:52.150> higher<00:04:53.150> price<00:04:53.539> on<00:04:53.930> the<00:04:54.199> set<00:04:54.470> but<00:04:55.300> as

00:04:56.290 --> 00:04:56.300 
likely higher price on the set but as

00:04:56.300 --> 00:05:00.189 
likely higher price on the set but as
you<00:04:56.509> can<00:04:56.690> see<00:04:58.570> there<00:04:59.570> is<00:04:59.660> like<00:04:59.870> a<00:04:59.900> different

00:05:00.189 --> 00:05:00.199 
you can see there is like a different

00:05:00.199 --> 00:05:05.879 
you can see there is like a different
type<00:05:01.130> of<00:05:01.160> connectors<00:05:03.070> more<00:05:04.070> ways<00:05:04.280> to<00:05:04.610> connect

00:05:05.879 --> 00:05:05.889 
type of connectors more ways to connect

00:05:05.889 --> 00:05:10.510 
type of connectors more ways to connect
inside<00:05:06.889> your<00:05:07.039> car<00:05:07.280> and<00:05:07.729> they<00:05:08.539> have<00:05:09.520> much

00:05:10.510 --> 00:05:10.520 
inside your car and they have much

00:05:10.520 --> 00:05:13.210 
inside your car and they have much
higher<00:05:10.759> quality<00:05:10.970> resistor<00:05:11.780> inside<00:05:12.110> so<00:05:12.500> it

00:05:13.210 --> 00:05:13.220 
higher quality resistor inside so it

00:05:13.220 --> 00:05:17.379 
higher quality resistor inside so it
doesn't<00:05:13.580> overheat<00:05:14.620> so<00:05:15.620> as<00:05:16.190> the<00:05:16.729> previous<00:05:17.180> ones

00:05:17.379 --> 00:05:17.389 
doesn't overheat so as the previous ones

00:05:17.389 --> 00:05:21.580 
doesn't overheat so as the previous ones
and<00:05:17.659> and<00:05:18.110> works<00:05:18.860> much<00:05:19.370> better<00:05:19.720> so<00:05:20.720> and<00:05:21.080> i<00:05:21.289> just

00:05:21.580 --> 00:05:21.590 
and and works much better so and i just

00:05:21.590 --> 00:05:29.800 
and and works much better so and i just
do<00:05:21.770> a<00:05:21.800> quick<00:05:22.039> connection<00:05:27.909> why<00:05:28.909> do<00:05:28.970> those<00:05:29.570> with

00:05:29.800 --> 00:05:29.810 
do a quick connection why do those with

00:05:29.810 --> 00:05:32.589 
do a quick connection why do those with
the<00:05:29.960> white<00:05:30.169> and<00:05:30.759> as<00:05:31.759> you<00:05:31.909> can<00:05:32.060> see<00:05:32.120> here<00:05:32.509> is

00:05:32.589 --> 00:05:32.599 
the white and as you can see here is

00:05:32.599 --> 00:05:37.089 
the white and as you can see here is
plastic<00:05:33.110> coating<00:05:33.580> however<00:05:34.930> I<00:05:35.979> recommend<00:05:36.979> you

00:05:37.089 --> 00:05:37.099 
plastic coating however I recommend you

00:05:37.099 --> 00:05:40.749 
plastic coating however I recommend you
to<00:05:37.400> just<00:05:38.000> in<00:05:38.150> case<00:05:38.389> to<00:05:38.690> take<00:05:39.680> power<00:05:40.009> with<00:05:40.580> the

00:05:40.749 --> 00:05:40.759 
to just in case to take power with the

00:05:40.759 --> 00:05:44.350 
to just in case to take power with the
electrical<00:05:41.330> tape<00:05:41.539> to<00:05:42.409> prevent<00:05:43.360> during

00:05:44.350 --> 00:05:44.360 
electrical tape to prevent during

00:05:44.360 --> 00:05:47.950 
electrical tape to prevent during
vibration<00:05:44.800> it<00:05:45.800> might<00:05:46.130> slip<00:05:46.729> and<00:05:47.030> caused<00:05:47.690> the

00:05:47.950 --> 00:05:47.960 
vibration it might slip and caused the

00:05:47.960 --> 00:05:52.890 
vibration it might slip and caused the
short-circuit<00:05:48.680> so<00:05:49.210> okay<00:05:50.210> and<00:05:50.240> then<00:05:50.719> we<00:05:50.900> go

00:05:52.890 --> 00:05:52.900 
short-circuit so okay and then we go

00:05:52.900 --> 00:05:57.850 
short-circuit so okay and then we go
next<00:05:53.900> connector<00:05:54.500> so<00:05:55.430> here<00:05:55.849> with<00:05:56.240> this<00:05:56.860> this

00:05:57.850 --> 00:05:57.860 
next connector so here with this this

00:05:57.860 --> 00:06:01.439 
next connector so here with this this
end<00:05:58.219> connector<00:05:58.810> as<00:05:59.810> you<00:05:59.990> can<00:06:00.169> see<00:06:00.380> here<00:06:00.560> is

00:06:01.439 --> 00:06:01.449 
end connector as you can see here is

00:06:01.449 --> 00:06:07.379 
end connector as you can see here is
blue<00:06:02.449> and<00:06:02.780> white<00:06:03.699> color<00:06:04.699> wire

00:06:07.379 --> 00:06:07.389 

00:06:07.389 --> 00:06:11.330 

you<00:06:07.479> have<00:06:07.659> to<00:06:07.840> just<00:06:08.669> we<00:06:09.669> have<00:06:09.849> just<00:06:10.150> to<00:06:10.300> test

00:06:11.330 --> 00:06:11.340 
you have to just we have just to test

00:06:11.340 --> 00:06:20.700 
you have to just we have just to test
okay<00:06:13.830> so<00:06:16.050> you<00:06:17.050> just<00:06:17.319> connect<00:06:19.259> any<00:06:20.259> of<00:06:20.469> them

00:06:20.700 --> 00:06:20.710 
okay so you just connect any of them

00:06:20.710 --> 00:06:23.570 
okay so you just connect any of them
because<00:06:21.009> those<00:06:21.460> both<00:06:21.729> are<00:06:21.939> black<00:06:22.120> and<00:06:22.419> see<00:06:22.750> if

00:06:23.570 --> 00:06:23.580 
because those both are black and see if

00:06:23.580 --> 00:06:28.350 
because those both are black and see if
your<00:06:25.080> LED<00:06:26.080> doesn't<00:06:26.469> light<00:06:26.620> up<00:06:26.969> just<00:06:27.969> change

00:06:28.350 --> 00:06:28.360 
your LED doesn't light up just change

00:06:28.360 --> 00:06:32.640 
your LED doesn't light up just change
them<00:06:28.689> so<00:06:28.930> because<00:06:30.569> plus/minus<00:06:31.599> it<00:06:32.139> works<00:06:32.439> only

00:06:32.640 --> 00:06:32.650 
them so because plus/minus it works only

00:06:32.650 --> 00:06:36.300 
them so because plus/minus it works only

00:06:36.300 --> 00:06:36.310 
one way on cree LED chip so if you

00:06:36.310 --> 00:06:40.200 
one way on cree LED chip so if you
accidentally<00:06:37.319> connect<00:06:38.319> wrong<00:06:39.129> way<00:06:39.400> plus<00:06:39.849> with

00:06:40.200 --> 00:06:40.210 
accidentally connect wrong way plus with

00:06:40.210 --> 00:06:44.119 
accidentally connect wrong way plus with
-<00:06:40.539> -<00:06:40.960> lipgloss<00:06:41.349> and<00:06:41.650> you<00:06:42.460> will<00:06:42.879> not<00:06:43.029> see<00:06:43.300> here

00:06:44.119 --> 00:06:44.129 
- - lipgloss and you will not see here

00:06:44.129 --> 00:06:47.159

and<00:06:45.129> it<00:06:45.250> doesn't<00:06:45.610> light<00:06:45.879> up<00:06:45.909> so<00:06:46.389> just<00:06:46.689> change

00:06:47.159 --> 00:06:47.169 
and it doesn't light up so just change

00:06:47.169 --> 00:06:52.860 
and it doesn't light up so just change
this<00:06:47.439> was<00:06:48.219> it<00:06:48.370> right<00:06:49.469> in<00:06:50.469> some<00:06:50.770> in<00:06:51.729> some<00:06:51.870> e6000

socket<00:06:58.810> like<00:06:59.199> here<00:06:59.650> so<00:07:00.370> that's<00:07:00.639> why<00:07:00.849> this

00:07:01.469 --> 00:07:01.479 
socket like here so that's why this

00:07:01.479 --> 00:07:06.600 
socket like here so that's why this
factory<00:07:01.960> produces<00:07:04.710> like<00:07:05.710> loosen<00:07:06.099> connectors

00:07:06.600 --> 00:07:06.610 
factory produces like loosen connectors

00:07:06.610 --> 00:07:11.279 
factory produces like loosen connectors
like<00:07:06.939> it's<00:07:08.189> it's<00:07:09.189> not<00:07:09.400> the<00:07:09.550> one<00:07:09.729> cable<00:07:10.330> like<00:07:10.689> on

00:07:11.279 --> 00:07:11.289 
like it's it's not the one cable like on

00:07:11.289 --> 00:07:14.010 
like it's it's not the one cable like on
those<00:07:11.500> one<00:07:11.800> so<00:07:12.490> giving<00:07:13.120> you<00:07:13.240> a<00:07:13.270> chance<00:07:13.479> to<00:07:13.659> just

00:07:14.010 --> 00:07:14.020 
those one so giving you a chance to just

00:07:14.020 --> 00:07:17.159 
those one so giving you a chance to just
to<00:07:14.169> tap<00:07:14.379> in<00:07:14.589> into<00:07:14.949> your<00:07:15.479> factory<00:07:16.479> harness<00:07:16.629> so

00:07:17.159 --> 00:07:17.169 
to tap in into your factory harness so

00:07:17.169 --> 00:07:20.939 
to tap in into your factory harness so
this<00:07:17.740> is<00:07:17.889> much<00:07:18.099> better<00:07:18.370> choice<00:07:18.669> and<00:07:19.060> as<00:07:19.569> i<00:07:19.949> told

00:07:20.939 --> 00:07:20.949 
this is much better choice and as i told

00:07:20.949 --> 00:07:24.180 
this is much better choice and as i told
you<00:07:21.099> before<00:07:21.599> it's<00:07:22.889> slightly<00:07:23.889> more<00:07:24.099> expensive

00:07:24.180 --> 00:07:24.190 
you before it's slightly more expensive

00:07:24.190 --> 00:07:27.510 
you before it's slightly more expensive
and<00:07:25.060> then<00:07:25.300> for<00:07:25.599> the<00:07:25.690> generation<00:07:26.229> but<00:07:27.069> because

00:07:27.510 --> 00:07:27.520 
and then for the generation but because

00:07:27.520 --> 00:07:30.809 
and then for the generation but because
the<00:07:27.729> resistor<00:07:28.180> was<00:07:28.419> upgraded<00:07:29.460> you<00:07:30.460> haven't

00:07:30.809 --> 00:07:30.819 
the resistor was upgraded you haven't

00:07:30.819 --> 00:07:34.439 
the resistor was upgraded you haven't
had<00:07:30.969> any<00:07:31.150> problem<00:07:31.569> yet<00:07:32.099> so<00:07:33.210> thank<00:07:34.210> you<00:07:34.300> for

00:07:34.439 --> 00:07:34.449 
had any problem yet so thank you for

00:07:34.449 --> 00:07:36.779 
had any problem yet so thank you for
watching
