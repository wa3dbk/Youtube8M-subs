guitar<00:03:35.910> and<00:03:36.090> then<00:03:36.210> some<00:03:36.450> kind<00:03:36.660> of<00:03:36.780> a<00:03:36.870> low<00:03:37.080> five

00:03:37.370 --> 00:03:37.380 
guitar and then some kind of a low five

00:03:37.380 --> 00:03:39.320 
guitar and then some kind of a low five
production<00:03:38.040> sound<00:03:38.340> but<00:03:38.820> what<00:03:38.880> I<00:03:38.940> like<00:03:39.180> about

00:03:39.320 --> 00:03:39.330 
production sound but what I like about

00:03:39.330 --> 00:03:41.330 
production sound but what I like about
this<00:03:39.660> is<00:03:39.870> that<00:03:39.900> I<00:03:40.080> mean<00:03:40.350> it's<00:03:40.770> a<00:03:40.920> little<00:03:41.190> low

00:03:41.330 --> 00:03:41.340 
this is that I mean it's a little low

00:03:41.340 --> 00:03:44.000 
this is that I mean it's a little low
fly<00:03:41.640> but<00:03:42.300> it's<00:03:42.420> not<00:03:42.600> ridiculously<00:03:43.350> so<00:03:43.710> and

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:44.010 
fly but it's not ridiculously so and

00:03:44.010 --> 00:03:46.880 
fly but it's not ridiculously so and
there<00:03:44.340> really<00:03:44.520> aren't<00:03:44.910> any<00:03:45.330> just<00:03:46.140> gimmicky

00:03:46.880 --> 00:03:46.890 
there really aren't any just gimmicky

00:03:46.890 --> 00:03:49.730 
there really aren't any just gimmicky
quirks<00:03:47.310> in<00:03:47.550> it<00:03:47.670> it's<00:03:48.060> just<00:03:48.480> good<00:03:48.960> songwriting

00:03:49.730 --> 00:03:49.740 
quirks in it it's just good songwriting

00:03:49.740 --> 00:03:52.640 
quirks in it it's just good songwriting

00:04:38.089 --> 00:04:38.099 
and that's something that I love hearing

00:04:38.099 --> 00:04:40.610 
and that's something that I love hearing
when<00:04:38.280> I<00:04:38.310> listen<00:04:38.639> to<00:04:38.729> an<00:04:38.849> album<00:04:39.500> one<00:04:40.500> of<00:04:40.530> the

00:04:40.610 --> 00:04:40.620 
when I listen to an album one of the

00:04:40.620 --> 00:04:41.929 
when I listen to an album one of the
other<00:04:40.830> things<00:04:41.069> about<00:04:41.129> the<00:04:41.340> songwriting<00:04:41.550> that

00:04:41.929 --> 00:04:41.939 
other things about the songwriting that

00:04:41.939 --> 00:04:43.700 
other things about the songwriting that
I<00:04:41.969> notice<00:04:42.270> is<00:04:42.389> that<00:04:42.419> they<00:04:42.659> really<00:04:42.930> know<00:04:43.500> how<00:04:43.530> to

00:04:43.700 --> 00:04:43.710 
I notice is that they really know how to

00:04:43.710 --> 00:04:47.240 
I notice is that they really know how to
use<00:04:44.360> the<00:04:45.360> the<00:04:45.629> songwriting<00:04:46.500> trick<00:04:46.830> of<00:04:47.069> the

00:04:47.240 --> 00:04:47.250 
use the the songwriting trick of the

00:04:47.250 --> 00:04:49.309 
use the the songwriting trick of the
rest<00:04:47.550> you<00:04:48.210> know<00:04:48.330> yeah<00:04:48.479> in<00:04:48.719> the<00:04:48.870> middle<00:04:49.139> of<00:04:49.229> a

00:04:49.309 --> 00:04:49.319 
rest you know yeah in the middle of a

00:04:49.319 --> 00:04:50.779 
rest you know yeah in the middle of a
chorus<00:04:49.650> they'll<00:04:49.919> take<00:04:50.099> a<00:04:50.129> second<00:04:50.610> and<00:04:50.699> just

00:04:50.779 --> 00:04:50.789 
chorus they'll take a second and just

00:04:50.789 --> 00:04:52.730 
chorus they'll take a second and just
not<00:04:51.180> play<00:04:51.449> a<00:04:51.479> note<00:04:51.719> you<00:04:51.780> know<00:04:52.050> or<00:04:52.289> where

00:04:52.730 --> 00:04:52.740 
not play a note you know or where

00:04:52.740 --> 00:04:54.409 
not play a note you know or where
they'll<00:04:52.889> play<00:04:53.219> arrange<00:04:53.759> the<00:04:53.969> parts<00:04:54.240> of<00:04:54.330> that

00:04:54.409 --> 00:04:54.419 
they'll play arrange the parts of that

00:04:54.419 --> 00:04:56.059 
they'll play arrange the parts of that
there's<00:04:54.629> a<00:04:54.719> space<00:04:55.110> in<00:04:55.379> between<00:04:55.409> that<00:04:55.919> these

00:04:56.059 --> 00:04:56.069 
there's a space in between that these

00:04:56.069 --> 00:04:58.670 
there's a space in between that these
two<00:04:56.280> guitar<00:04:56.639> lines<00:04:56.879> and<00:04:57.150> and<00:04:57.990> and<00:04:58.319> and<00:04:58.530> that

00:04:58.670 --> 00:04:58.680 
two guitar lines and and and and that

00:04:58.680 --> 00:05:00.770 
two guitar lines and and and and that
draws<00:04:59.280> the<00:04:59.610> listeners<00:05:00.000> attention<00:05:00.030> in<00:05:00.599> and

00:05:00.770 --> 00:05:00.780 
draws the listeners attention in and

00:05:00.780 --> 00:05:02.779 
draws the listeners attention in and
says<00:05:01.020> listen<00:05:01.530> to<00:05:01.830> me<00:05:01.979> you<00:05:02.250> know<00:05:02.370> that<00:05:02.400> that

00:05:02.779 --> 00:05:02.789 
says listen to me you know that that

00:05:02.789 --> 00:05:05.600 
says listen to me you know that that
contrast<00:05:03.449> is<00:05:03.599> so<00:05:03.930> important<00:05:04.500> in<00:05:04.680> any<00:05:05.159> and<00:05:05.460> any

00:05:05.600 --> 00:05:05.610 
contrast is so important in any and any

00:05:05.610 --> 00:05:07.640 
contrast is so important in any and any
song<00:05:06.030> or<00:05:06.330> any<00:05:06.449> album<00:05:06.870> you<00:05:06.990> have<00:05:07.139> to<00:05:07.259> have<00:05:07.409> that

00:05:07.640 --> 00:05:07.650 
song or any album you have to have that

00:05:07.650 --> 00:05:09.709 
song or any album you have to have that
and<00:05:07.770> I<00:05:07.800> think<00:05:07.979> that<00:05:08.069> they<00:05:08.159> do<00:05:08.219> a<00:05:08.310> good<00:05:08.400> job<00:05:08.719> and

00:05:09.709 --> 00:05:09.719 
and I think that they do a good job and

00:05:20.869 --> 00:05:20.879 
what are you sitting at for a score I'm

00:05:20.879 --> 00:05:23.149 
what are you sitting at for a score I'm
gonna<00:05:21.000> go<00:05:21.150> 87<00:05:21.750> 87<00:05:22.169> I<00:05:22.409> didn't<00:05:22.680> really<00:05:22.830> like<00:05:22.979> this

00:05:23.149 --> 00:05:23.159 
gonna go 87 87 I didn't really like this

00:05:23.159 --> 00:05:25.070 
gonna go 87 87 I didn't really like this
yep<00:05:23.520> I'm<00:05:23.669> at<00:05:23.849> an<00:05:23.969> 89<00:05:24.419> I<00:05:24.449> think<00:05:24.810> that<00:05:24.930> that's

00:05:25.070 --> 00:05:25.080 
yep I'm at an 89 I think that that's

00:05:25.080 --> 00:05:26.839 
yep I'm at an 89 I think that that's
that's<00:05:25.439> where<00:05:25.710> this<00:05:25.830> is<00:05:25.889> at<00:05:26.159> for<00:05:26.400> me<00:05:26.490> and<00:05:26.639> I

00:05:26.839 --> 00:05:26.849 
that's where this is at for me and I

00:05:26.849 --> 00:05:30.409 
that's where this is at for me and I
think<00:05:26.909> that<00:05:27.150> if<00:05:27.990> I<00:05:28.080> really<00:05:28.469> were<00:05:28.650> to<00:05:29.039> have<00:05:29.759> you

00:05:30.409 --> 00:05:30.419 
think that if I really were to have you

00:05:30.419 --> 00:05:32.180 
think that if I really were to have you
know<00:05:30.539> I<00:05:30.569> think<00:05:31.139> part<00:05:31.379> of<00:05:31.469> the<00:05:31.590> reason<00:05:31.620> why<00:05:31.979> it's

00:05:32.180 --> 00:05:32.190 
know I think part of the reason why it's

00:05:32.190 --> 00:05:33.709 
know I think part of the reason why it's
it's<00:05:32.460> a<00:05:32.580> high<00:05:32.819> score<00:05:33.090> for<00:05:33.240> me<00:05:33.300> it's<00:05:33.479> just<00:05:33.629> I've

00:05:33.709 --> 00:05:33.719 
it's a high score for me it's just I've

00:05:33.719 --> 00:05:35.930 
it's a high score for me it's just I've
been<00:05:34.110> with<00:05:34.259> this<00:05:34.379> album<00:05:34.740> for<00:05:34.889> so<00:05:35.039> long<00:05:35.219> I<00:05:35.699> think

00:05:35.930 --> 00:05:35.940 
been with this album for so long I think

00:05:35.940 --> 00:05:37.010 
been with this album for so long I think
he<00:05:36.029> would<00:05:36.150> develop<00:05:36.389> personal<00:05:36.990> relationships

00:05:37.010 --> 00:05:37.020 
he would develop personal relationships

00:05:37.020 --> 00:05:39.890 
he would develop personal relationships
without<00:05:37.889> oh<00:05:38.069> yeah<00:05:38.310> yeah<00:05:38.520> and<00:05:38.729> maybe<00:05:39.479> over<00:05:39.629> time

00:05:39.890 --> 00:05:39.900 
without oh yeah yeah and maybe over time

00:05:39.900 --> 00:05:41.300 
without oh yeah yeah and maybe over time
that<00:05:40.020> would<00:05:40.110> go<00:05:40.229> up<00:05:40.409> because<00:05:40.529> of<00:05:40.710> that<00:05:40.949> but<00:05:41.129> I'm

00:05:41.300 --> 00:05:41.310
