00:00:14.919 --> 00:00:14.929 
rounded

00:00:14.929 --> 00:00:18.920 
rounded
now<00:00:15.929> this<00:00:16.500> nice<00:00:16.800> flat<00:00:17.190> round<00:00:17.640> head<00:00:17.910> is<00:00:18.119> just

00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:18.930 
now this nice flat round head is just

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:22.790 
now this nice flat round head is just
proximal<00:00:19.560> to<00:00:20.010> the<00:00:20.760> neck<00:00:21.119> of<00:00:21.330> the<00:00:21.720> radius<00:00:22.109> the

00:00:22.790 --> 00:00:22.800 
proximal to the neck of the radius the

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:26.300 
proximal to the neck of the radius the
neck<00:00:24.109> while<00:00:25.109> this<00:00:25.320> bump<00:00:25.710> you<00:00:25.920> see<00:00:26.099> down<00:00:26.250> here

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:26.310 
neck while this bump you see down here

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:29.900 
neck while this bump you see down here
that<00:00:27.500> bump<00:00:28.500> is<00:00:28.769> going<00:00:29.220> to<00:00:29.310> be<00:00:29.369> the<00:00:29.460> radial

00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:29.910 
that bump is going to be the radial

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:34.490 
that bump is going to be the radial
tuberosity<00:00:31.309> so<00:00:32.309> it<00:00:32.369> goes<00:00:32.520> head<00:00:33.200> neck<00:00:34.200> or

00:00:34.490 --> 00:00:34.500 
tuberosity so it goes head neck or

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:37.060 
tuberosity so it goes head neck or
radial<00:00:35.250> tuberosity

00:00:37.060 --> 00:00:37.070 
radial tuberosity

00:00:37.070 --> 00:00:40.729 
radial tuberosity
but<00:00:38.070> if<00:00:38.129> continue<00:00:38.460> down<00:00:38.820> the<00:00:39.059> bone<00:00:39.620> you<00:00:40.620> get

00:00:40.729 --> 00:00:40.739 
but if continue down the bone you get

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:44.690 
but if continue down the bone you get
down<00:00:40.920> to<00:00:41.070> this<00:00:41.160> point<00:00:42.290> that<00:00:43.290> point<00:00:43.680> is<00:00:44.040> going

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:44.700 
down to this point that point is going

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:48.410 
down to this point that point is going
to<00:00:44.760> be<00:00:44.820> the<00:00:45.030> styloid<00:00:45.690> process<00:00:46.879> the<00:00:47.879> styloid

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:48.420 
to be the styloid process the styloid

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:53.930 
to be the styloid process the styloid
process<00:00:51.050> well<00:00:52.050> since<00:00:52.620> we<00:00:52.710> had<00:00:52.949> a<00:00:52.980> radial<00:00:53.760> notch

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:53.940 
process well since we had a radial notch

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:56.360 
process well since we had a radial notch
on<00:00:54.329> the<00:00:54.809> ulna<00:00:54.989> which<00:00:55.770> would<00:00:55.920> have<00:00:56.039> an<00:00:56.129> ulnar

00:00:56.360 --> 00:00:56.370 
on the ulna which would have an ulnar

00:00:56.370 --> 00:01:01.430 
on the ulna which would have an ulnar
notch<00:00:56.640> on<00:00:56.969> the<00:00:57.329> radius<00:00:58.969> this<00:01:00.440> smoothest

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:01.440 
notch on the radius this smoothest

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:05.149 
notch on the radius this smoothest
portion<00:01:02.129> right<00:01:02.280> here<00:01:02.960> that<00:01:03.960> is<00:01:04.320> going<00:01:04.830> to<00:01:04.949> be

00:01:05.149 --> 00:01:05.159 
portion right here that is going to be

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:09.350 
portion right here that is going to be
the<00:01:05.670> ulnar<00:01:06.330> notch<00:01:06.689> you<00:01:07.490> can<00:01:08.490> see<00:01:08.700> articulates

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:09.360 
the ulnar notch you can see articulates

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:11.960 
the ulnar notch you can see articulates
the<00:01:09.479> ulna<00:01:09.979> so<00:01:10.979> the<00:01:11.070> head<00:01:11.220> of<00:01:11.280> the<00:01:11.340> race<00:01:11.490> puts

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:11.970 
the ulna so the head of the race puts

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:14.570 
the ulna so the head of the race puts
the<00:01:12.119> radial<00:01:12.420> notch<00:01:13.010> the<00:01:14.010> head<00:01:14.159> of<00:01:14.220> the<00:01:14.280> ulna

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:14.580 
the radial notch the head of the ulna

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:17.600 
the radial notch the head of the ulna
goes<00:01:15.090> the<00:01:15.240> ulnar<00:01:15.509> notch<00:01:16.340> forming<00:01:17.340> the<00:01:17.430> two

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:17.610 
goes the ulnar notch forming the two

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:21.780 
goes the ulnar notch forming the two
bones<00:01:17.820> of<00:01:18.229> your<00:01:19.229> form

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:21.790 

00:01:21.790 --> 00:01:27.090 

so<00:01:22.420> this<00:01:22.630> is<00:01:22.930> going<00:01:23.350> to<00:01:23.470> be<00:01:24.270> your<00:01:25.270> radius<00:01:26.100> we

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:27.100 
so this is going to be your radius we

00:01:27.100 --> 00:01:30.380 
so this is going to be your radius we
have<00:01:27.220> figure<00:01:27.550> out<00:01:27.670> is<00:01:28.000> the<00:01:28.330> right<00:01:28.570> or<00:01:28.900> left

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:30.390 
have figure out is the right or left

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:34.910 
have figure out is the right or left
well<00:01:31.390> I<00:01:31.420> know<00:01:31.630> the<00:01:31.930> head<00:01:32.200> has<00:01:32.890> to<00:01:32.920> be<00:01:33.510> proximal

00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:34.920 
well I know the head has to be proximal

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:37.730 
well I know the head has to be proximal
because<00:01:35.920> the<00:01:36.040> head<00:01:36.160> articulates<00:01:36.730> with<00:01:36.970> what

00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:37.740 
because the head articulates with what

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:40.830 
because the head articulates with what
articulates<00:01:38.740> with<00:01:38.830> the<00:01:38.890> ulna<00:01:38.950> at<00:01:39.670> the<00:01:40.510> radial

00:01:40.830 --> 00:01:40.840 
articulates with the ulna at the radial

00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:44.700 
articulates with the ulna at the radial
notch<00:01:41.430> but<00:01:42.430> it<00:01:42.490> can<00:01:42.580> also<00:01:42.820> be<00:01:43.060> rights<00:01:43.900> at<00:01:44.650> the

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:44.710 
notch but it can also be rights at the

00:01:44.710 --> 00:01:48.030 
notch but it can also be rights at the
capitulum<00:01:46.080> right<00:01:47.080> at<00:01:47.230> the<00:01:47.290> capitulum<00:01:47.620> of<00:01:47.740> the

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:48.040 
capitulum right at the capitulum of the

00:01:48.040 --> 00:01:55.950 
capitulum right at the capitulum of the
humerus<00:01:51.330> so<00:01:52.330> we<00:01:52.450> have<00:01:52.600> the<00:01:52.810> head<00:01:53.290> proximal<00:01:54.960> we

00:01:55.950 --> 00:01:55.960 
humerus so we have the head proximal we

00:01:55.960 --> 00:01:59.060 
humerus so we have the head proximal we
need<00:01:56.080> to<00:01:56.170> have<00:01:56.410> the<00:01:56.620> styloid<00:01:57.250> process<00:01:57.990> distal

00:01:59.060 --> 00:01:59.070 
need to have the styloid process distal

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:03.420 
need to have the styloid process distal
but<00:02:00.070> also<00:02:00.390> lateral<00:02:01.920> so<00:02:02.920> how<00:02:03.010> do<00:02:03.070> we<00:02:03.100> know<00:02:03.250> if<00:02:03.340> it

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:03.430 
but also lateral so how do we know if it

00:02:03.430 --> 00:02:06.390 
but also lateral so how do we know if it
goes<00:02:03.550> like<00:02:03.700> this<00:02:03.760> on<00:02:04.360> the<00:02:04.780> right<00:02:04.960> side<00:02:05.229> or<00:02:05.560> like

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:06.400 
goes like this on the right side or like

00:02:06.400 --> 00:02:10.290 
goes like this on the right side or like
this<00:02:06.729> on<00:02:06.970> the<00:02:07.240> left<00:02:07.479> side<00:02:08.850> for<00:02:09.850> the<00:02:09.940> novices

00:02:10.290 --> 00:02:10.300 
this on the left side for the novices

00:02:10.300 --> 00:02:13.170 
this on the left side for the novices
there's<00:02:10.479> a<00:02:10.570> shallow<00:02:10.869> scoop<00:02:11.410> right<00:02:11.650> here<00:02:12.180> this

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:13.180 
there's a shallow scoop right here this

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:18.570 
there's a shallow scoop right here this
shallow<00:02:13.780> scoop<00:02:14.260> has<00:02:15.070> to<00:02:15.370> face<00:02:15.840> anterior<00:02:17.580> that

00:02:18.570 --> 00:02:18.580 
shallow scoop has to face anterior that

00:02:18.580 --> 00:02:24.050 
shallow scoop has to face anterior that
makes<00:02:18.820> this<00:02:19.060> a<00:02:19.350> right<00:02:20.350> radius<00:02:22.140> head<00:02:23.140> proximal

00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:24.060 
makes this a right radius head proximal

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:27.990 
makes this a right radius head proximal
styloid<00:02:25.060> process<00:02:25.739> lateral<00:02:26.739> and<00:02:27.220> the<00:02:27.550> shallow
