the sonata is sort of similar to the

00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:25.429

00:00:28.009 --> 00:00:28.019 
same it's one of the competitors and the

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:29.509

new camry came out at the show and now
I've<00:00:29.640> got<00:00:29.760> the<00:00:29.849> Sonata<00:00:30.179> what<00:00:30.810> do<00:00:30.869> you<00:00:30.900> think<00:00:30.990> it

00:00:31.939 --> 00:00:31.949 
I've got the Sonata what do you think it

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:33.049 
I've got the Sonata what do you think it
is<00:00:32.070> yes<00:00:32.279> it<00:00:32.399> fits<00:00:32.550> right<00:00:32.790> into<00:00:32.940> that

00:00:33.049 --> 00:00:33.059 
is yes it fits right into that

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:35.450 
is yes it fits right into that
competitive<00:00:33.690> set<00:00:33.870> and<00:00:34.170> personally<00:00:34.739> I'm<00:00:35.160> more

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:35.460 
competitive set and personally I'm more

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:37.670 
competitive set and personally I'm more
of<00:00:35.700> a<00:00:35.760> fan<00:00:36.030> of<00:00:36.270> these<00:00:36.540> not<00:00:37.020> as<00:00:37.170> design<00:00:37.500> I<00:00:37.530> think

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:37.680 
of a fan of these not as design I think

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:40.790 
of a fan of these not as design I think
it's<00:00:38.010> a<00:00:38.100> little<00:00:38.219> bit<00:00:38.370> more<00:00:39.000> aggressive<00:00:39.800> letak

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:40.800 
it's a little bit more aggressive letak

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:43.850 
it's a little bit more aggressive letak
more<00:00:41.760> mature<00:00:42.120> really<00:00:42.540> and<00:00:42.750> I<00:00:43.260> think<00:00:43.500> we<00:00:43.710> can

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:43.860 
more mature really and I think we can

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:46.069 
more mature really and I think we can
make<00:00:43.950> the<00:00:44.129> argument<00:00:44.160> that<00:00:44.610> the<00:00:44.940> sonata<00:00:45.660> and

00:00:46.069 --> 00:00:46.079 
make the argument that the sonata and

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:47.990 
make the argument that the sonata and
you<00:00:46.590> know<00:00:46.680> cars<00:00:46.950> on<00:00:47.070> the<00:00:47.129> diffusion<00:00:47.640> they<00:00:47.940> are

00:00:47.990 --> 00:00:48.000 
you know cars on the diffusion they are

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:50.840 
you know cars on the diffusion they are
more<00:00:48.360> striking<00:00:48.750> design<00:00:49.110> has<00:00:49.440> forced<00:00:50.280> hood<00:00:50.430> to

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:50.850 
more striking design has forced hood to

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:52.819 
more striking design has forced hood to
do<00:00:51.000> this<00:00:51.180> big<00:00:51.480> mid-cycle<00:00:51.899> refresh

00:00:52.819 --> 00:00:52.829 
do this big mid-cycle refresh

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:55.579 
do this big mid-cycle refresh
yeah<00:00:53.429> definitely<00:00:53.609> do<00:00:54.149> you<00:00:54.239> think<00:00:54.449> that<00:00:54.600> Toyota

00:00:55.579 --> 00:00:55.589 
yeah definitely do you think that Toyota

00:00:55.589 --> 00:00:57.290 
yeah definitely do you think that Toyota
which<00:00:55.949> so<00:00:56.219> you<00:00:56.280> think<00:00:56.579> that<00:00:56.670> this<00:00:56.820> one<00:00:57.000> is<00:00:57.030> more

00:00:57.290 --> 00:00:57.300 
which so you think that this one is more

00:00:57.300 --> 00:01:00.380 
which so you think that this one is more
successful<00:00:58.199> at<00:00:58.769> that<00:00:58.949> with<00:00:59.670> the<00:00:59.820> design<00:01:00.120> yes

00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:00.390 
successful at that with the design yes

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:02.630 
successful at that with the design yes
definitely<00:01:00.809> okay<00:01:01.350> so<00:01:01.920> the<00:01:02.129> car<00:01:02.280> is<00:01:02.309> all<00:01:02.519> new

00:01:02.630 --> 00:01:02.640 
definitely okay so the car is all new

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:03.950 
definitely okay so the car is all new
how<00:01:02.909> do<00:01:02.969> you<00:01:03.000> feel<00:01:03.149> about<00:01:03.179> the<00:01:03.449> design<00:01:03.750> I

00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:03.960 
how do you feel about the design I

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:05.870 
how do you feel about the design I
really<00:01:04.559> like<00:01:04.739> it<00:01:04.920> and<00:01:05.009> i<00:01:05.100> think<00:01:05.339> the<00:01:05.489> word<00:01:05.519> to

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:05.880 
really like it and i think the word to

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:08.480 
really like it and i think the word to
use<00:01:06.060> here<00:01:06.330> is<00:01:06.479> it's<00:01:06.689> much<00:01:06.930> more<00:01:07.200> refined<00:01:07.830> what

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:08.490 
use here is it's much more refined what

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:09.679 
use here is it's much more refined what
Hyundai<00:01:08.729> have<00:01:08.850> been<00:01:09.000> doing<00:01:09.330> with<00:01:09.479> their

00:01:09.679 --> 00:01:09.689 
Hyundai have been doing with their

00:01:09.689 --> 00:01:11.960 
Hyundai have been doing with their
swoopy<00:01:10.289> previous<00:01:10.830> generation<00:01:11.430> cars<00:01:11.700> was

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:11.970 
swoopy previous generation cars was

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:13.550 
swoopy previous generation cars was
really<00:01:12.270> trying<00:01:12.509> to<00:01:12.570> grab<00:01:12.960> people's<00:01:13.229> attention

00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:13.560 
really trying to grab people's attention

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:15.889 
really trying to grab people's attention
and<00:01:14.250> now<00:01:14.610> that<00:01:14.789> they<00:01:14.909> have<00:01:14.939> it<00:01:15.360> they're<00:01:15.630> trying

00:01:15.889 --> 00:01:15.899 
and now that they have it they're trying

00:01:15.899 --> 00:01:17.330 
and now that they have it they're trying
to<00:01:16.020> keep<00:01:16.229> it<00:01:16.380> with<00:01:16.560> something<00:01:16.920> a<00:01:16.979> little<00:01:17.130> bit

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:17.340 
to keep it with something a little bit

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:18.919 
to keep it with something a little bit
more<00:01:17.520> toned<00:01:17.820> down<00:01:18.000> that's<00:01:18.330> not<00:01:18.509> quite<00:01:18.720> as

00:01:18.919 --> 00:01:18.929 
more toned down that's not quite as

00:01:18.929 --> 00:01:20.810 
more toned down that's not quite as
controversial<00:01:19.409> great<00:01:20.280> I<00:01:20.310> mean<00:01:20.429> we've<00:01:20.670> heard

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:20.820 
controversial great I mean we've heard

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:22.450 
controversial great I mean we've heard
that<00:01:20.909> they<00:01:21.090> needed<00:01:21.270> to<00:01:21.390> be<00:01:21.539> more<00:01:21.689> conservative

00:01:22.450 --> 00:01:22.460 
that they needed to be more conservative

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:24.410 
that they needed to be more conservative
absolutely<00:01:23.460> and<00:01:23.520> I<00:01:23.610> think<00:01:23.640> this<00:01:23.939> car<00:01:24.210> is<00:01:24.240> a

00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:24.420 
absolutely and I think this car is a

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:26.960 
absolutely and I think this car is a
great<00:01:24.869> example<00:01:24.990> of<00:01:25.350> that<00:01:25.440> so<00:01:26.130> tell<00:01:26.610> me<00:01:26.640> there's

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:26.970 
great example of that so tell me there's

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:28.880 
great example of that so tell me there's
like<00:01:27.210> they<00:01:27.360> named<00:01:27.600> the<00:01:27.929> design<00:01:28.380> something

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:28.890 
like they named the design something

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:30.620 
like they named the design something
kind<00:01:29.280> of<00:01:29.369> wacky<00:01:29.520> what<00:01:29.789> is<00:01:29.880> this<00:01:30.000> blue<00:01:30.330> edicts

00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:30.630 
kind of wacky what is this blue edicts

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:33.889 
kind of wacky what is this blue edicts
