00:03:22.640 --> 00:03:22.650 
at the whole system that they gave the

00:03:22.650 --> 00:03:24.290 
at the whole system that they gave the
number<00:03:22.770> these<00:03:23.100> are<00:03:23.250> development<00:03:24.030> kits

00:03:24.290 --> 00:03:24.300 
number these are development kits

00:03:24.300 --> 00:03:26.990 
number these are development kits
doesn't<00:03:24.780> means<00:03:24.930> I<00:03:25.050> actually<00:03:25.380> looks<00:03:25.950> on<00:03:26.280> your

00:03:26.990 --> 00:03:27.000 
doesn't means I actually looks on your

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:29.570 
doesn't means I actually looks on your
playstation<00:03:27.750> 4<00:03:27.989> and<00:03:28.170> I'm<00:03:29.040> actually<00:03:29.220> speak

00:03:29.570 --> 00:03:29.580 
playstation 4 and I'm actually speak

00:03:29.580 --> 00:03:31.190 
playstation 4 and I'm actually speak
about<00:03:29.790> documents<00:03:30.360> or<00:03:30.450> at<00:03:30.540> least<00:03:30.720> this<00:03:30.989> is<00:03:31.170> a

00:03:31.190 --> 00:03:31.200 
about documents or at least this is a

00:03:31.200 --> 00:03:32.540 
about documents or at least this is a
really<00:03:31.500> good<00:03:31.620> document<00:03:32.160> I<00:03:32.220> was<00:03:32.310> released

00:03:32.540 --> 00:03:32.550 
really good document I was released

00:03:32.550 --> 00:03:34.340 
really good document I was released
today<00:03:32.670> so<00:03:32.850> this<00:03:33.150> actually<00:03:33.420> shows<00:03:33.630> off<00:03:34.110> the

00:03:34.340 --> 00:03:34.350 
today so this actually shows off the

00:03:34.350 --> 00:03:36.350 
today so this actually shows off the
development<00:03:34.920> kit<00:03:35.100> and<00:03:35.250> all<00:03:35.370> the<00:03:35.580> specs<00:03:35.910> of<00:03:36.060> the

00:03:36.350 --> 00:03:36.360 
development kit and all the specs of the

00:03:36.360 --> 00:03:38.990 
development kit and all the specs of the
prison<00:03:36.690> for<00:03:36.900> in<00:03:37.380> detail<00:03:38.010> so<00:03:38.760> you<00:03:38.850> may<00:03:38.970> have

00:03:38.990 --> 00:03:39.000 
prison for in detail so you may have

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:40.430 
prison for in detail so you may have
gotten<00:03:39.239> small<00:03:39.600> things<00:03:39.840> but<00:03:40.020> here<00:03:40.290> it's

00:03:40.430 --> 00:03:40.440 
gotten small things but here it's

00:03:40.440 --> 00:03:41.660 
gotten small things but here it's
actually<00:03:40.560> telling<00:03:40.980> you<00:03:41.070> that<00:03:41.280> the<00:03:41.430> power

00:03:41.660 --> 00:03:41.670 
actually telling you that the power

00:03:41.670 --> 00:03:44.690 
actually telling you that the power
supply<00:03:42.080> the<00:03:43.080> size<00:03:43.350> the<00:03:43.860> actual<00:03:44.250> direct

00:03:44.690 --> 00:03:44.700 
supply the size the actual direct

00:03:44.700 --> 00:03:46.340 
supply the size the actual direct
measurements<00:03:45.360> so<00:03:45.450> this<00:03:45.600> is<00:03:45.720> some<00:03:45.870> detailed

00:03:46.340 --> 00:03:46.350 
measurements so this is some detailed

00:03:46.350 --> 00:03:49.340 
measurements so this is some detailed
 even<00:03:47.130> the<00:03:47.250> the<00:03:48.150> wireless<00:03:48.570> LAN<00:03:48.780> all<00:03:49.140> those

00:03:49.340 --> 00:03:49.350 
 even the the wireless LAN all those

00:03:49.350 --> 00:03:51.620 
 even the the wireless LAN all those
functions<00:03:50.040> of<00:03:50.250> it<00:03:50.430> and<00:03:50.580> I<00:03:51.000> only<00:03:51.120> look<00:03:51.330> at<00:03:51.420> two

00:03:51.620 --> 00:03:51.630 
functions of it and I only look at two

00:03:51.630 --> 00:03:53.360 
functions of it and I only look at two
major<00:03:51.810> things<00:03:51.930> here<00:03:52.230> one<00:03:52.440> is<00:03:52.470> the<00:03:52.769> the

00:03:53.360 --> 00:03:53.370 
major things here one is the the

00:03:53.370 --> 00:03:56.720 
major things here one is the the
clocking<00:03:53.640> of<00:03:53.910> the<00:03:54.320> gigahertz<00:03:55.320> its<00:03:55.769> 2.75

00:03:56.720 --> 00:03:56.730 
clocking of the gigahertz its 2.75

00:03:56.730 --> 00:03:59.090 
clocking of the gigahertz its 2.75
gigahertz<00:03:57.120> but<00:03:57.720> please<00:03:57.989> pay<00:03:58.440> attention<00:03:58.620> to

00:03:59.090 --> 00:03:59.100 
gigahertz but please pay attention to

00:03:59.100 --> 00:04:01.400 
gigahertz but please pay attention to
what<00:03:59.220> a<00:03:59.250> cincy<00:03:59.730> maximum<00:04:00.330> clocking<00:04:00.810> so<00:04:01.230> this

00:04:01.400 --> 00:04:01.410 
what a cincy maximum clocking so this

00:04:01.410 --> 00:04:03.560 
what a cincy maximum clocking so this
means<00:04:01.620> at<00:04:01.890> like<00:04:02.670> if<00:04:02.850> you<00:04:03.000> guys<00:04:03.180> didn't

00:04:03.560 --> 00:04:03.570 
means at like if you guys didn't

00:04:03.570 --> 00:04:05.150 
means at like if you guys didn't
remember<00:04:03.810> the<00:04:04.530> guy<00:04:04.680> who<00:04:04.709> developed<00:04:05.100> the

00:04:05.150 --> 00:04:05.160 
remember the guy who developed the

00:04:05.160 --> 00:04:07.250 
remember the guy who developed the
position<00:04:05.610> actually<00:04:06.030> said<00:04:06.390> something<00:04:06.600> he<00:04:06.989> said

00:04:07.250 --> 00:04:07.260 
position actually said something he said

00:04:07.260 --> 00:04:11.390 
position actually said something he said
this<00:04:08.690> you<00:04:09.690> will<00:04:09.810> able<00:04:09.959> to<00:04:10.470> make<00:04:10.650> games<00:04:10.950> for<00:04:11.070> the

00:04:11.390 --> 00:04:11.400 
this you will able to make games for the

00:04:11.400 --> 00:04:14.330 
this you will able to make games for the
position<00:04:11.760> for<00:04:12.150> very<00:04:12.360> easily<00:04:12.600> but<00:04:13.590> mastering

00:04:14.330 --> 00:04:14.340 
position for very easily but mastering

00:04:14.340 --> 00:04:16.340 
position for very easily but mastering
it<00:04:14.550> I'm<00:04:14.700> becoming<00:04:15.090> very<00:04:15.360> good<00:04:15.480> at<00:04:15.989> making<00:04:16.260> the

00:04:16.340 --> 00:04:16.350 
it I'm becoming very good at making the

00:04:16.350 --> 00:04:18.409 
it I'm becoming very good at making the
best<00:04:16.590> games<00:04:16.919> on<00:04:17.100> system<00:04:17.489> is<00:04:17.640> gonna<00:04:17.970> take<00:04:18.209> some

00:04:18.409 --> 00:04:18.419 
best games on system is gonna take some

00:04:18.419 --> 00:04:21.110 
best games on system is gonna take some
time<00:04:18.480> so<00:04:19.440> this<00:04:19.769> clocking<00:04:20.250> is<00:04:20.370> maximum<00:04:20.880> is<00:04:21.030> the

00:04:21.110 --> 00:04:21.120 
time so this clocking is maximum is the

00:04:21.120 --> 00:04:22.640 
time so this clocking is maximum is the
maximum<00:04:21.479> they<00:04:21.600> can<00:04:21.720> push<00:04:21.900> a<00:04:21.930> game<00:04:22.229> up<00:04:22.410> in<00:04:22.530> the

00:04:22.640 --> 00:04:22.650 
maximum they can push a game up in the

00:04:22.650 --> 00:04:24.740 
maximum they can push a game up in the
as<00:04:22.950> fast<00:04:23.250> as<00:04:23.460> I<00:04:23.610> can<00:04:23.669> run<00:04:23.940> as<00:04:24.120> smooth<00:04:24.450> as<00:04:24.630> you

00:04:24.740 --> 00:04:24.750 
as fast as I can run as smooth as you

00:04:24.750 --> 00:04:27.050 
as fast as I can run as smooth as you
can<00:04:24.870> run<00:04:25.050> is<00:04:25.260> going<00:04:25.710> to<00:04:25.830> run<00:04:25.950> a<00:04:25.979> 2.75

00:04:27.050 --> 00:04:27.060 
can run is going to run a 2.75

00:04:27.060 --> 00:04:29.000 
can run is going to run a 2.75

you can't compare console to a pc by the

00:04:36.830 --> 00:04:36.840 
same time I mean this give me miles but

00:04:36.840 --> 00:04:38.240 
same time I mean this give me miles but
I<00:04:36.870> honestly<00:04:37.020> believe<00:04:37.470> it<00:04:37.560> to<00:04:37.620> be<00:04:37.710> miles<00:04:37.980> apart

00:04:38.240 --> 00:04:38.250 
I honestly believe it to be miles apart

I honestly believe it to be miles apart
better<00:04:38.550> than<00:04:39.210> the<00:04:39.330> patient<00:04:39.660> simply<00:04:39.900> because

00:04:40.190 --> 00:04:40.200 
better than the patient simply because

00:04:40.200 --> 00:04:42.530 
better than the patient simply because
the<00:04:40.290> fact<00:04:40.470> is<00:04:40.730> let's<00:04:41.730> look<00:04:41.790> at<00:04:41.910> the<00:04:41.970> patient<00:04:42.120> 3

00:04:42.530 --> 00:04:42.540 
the fact is let's look at the patient 3

00:04:42.540 --> 00:04:44.810 
the fact is let's look at the patient 3
we<00:04:43.260> have<00:04:43.410> problem<00:04:43.860> because<00:04:44.160> we<00:04:44.370> had<00:04:44.460> a<00:04:44.490> Cell

00:04:44.810 --> 00:04:44.820 
we have problem because we had a Cell

00:04:44.820 --> 00:04:47.540 
we have problem because we had a Cell
processor<00:04:45.740> sad<00:04:46.740> process<00:04:46.919> was<00:04:47.250> terrible

00:04:47.540 --> 00:04:47.550 
processor sad process was terrible

00:04:47.550 --> 00:04:49.159 
processor sad process was terrible
because<00:04:47.700> the<00:04:48.000> games<00:04:48.240> would<00:04:48.450> have<00:04:48.600> been<00:04:48.750> ported

00:04:49.159 --> 00:04:49.169 
because the games would have been ported

00:04:49.169 --> 00:04:50.960 
because the games would have been ported
it<00:04:49.320> was<00:04:49.410> difficult<00:04:49.650> some<00:04:50.250> developers<00:04:50.550> didn't

00:04:50.960 --> 00:04:50.970 
it was difficult some developers didn't

00:04:50.970 --> 00:04:52.280 
it was difficult some developers didn't
even<00:04:51.150> care<00:04:51.360> but<00:04:51.480> even<00:04:51.690> making<00:04:51.930> game<00:04:52.080> through

00:04:52.280 --> 00:04:52.290 
even care but even making game through

00:04:52.290 --> 00:04:54.740 
even care but even making game through
it<00:04:52.380> only<00:04:52.860> need<00:04:53.250> like<00:04:53.550> the<00:04:53.700> first<00:04:54.000> party<00:04:54.389> people

00:04:54.740 --> 00:04:54.750 
it only need like the first party people

00:04:54.750 --> 00:04:56.540 
it only need like the first party people
