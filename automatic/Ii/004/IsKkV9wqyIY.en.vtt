00:00:18.529 --> 00:00:18.539 
flush a machine I'm using a rocket

00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:20.269 
flush a machine I'm using a rocket
giotto<00:00:19.020> but<00:00:19.289> it's<00:00:19.380> essentially<00:00:19.800> the<00:00:19.890> same<00:00:19.920> for

00:00:20.269 --> 00:00:20.279 
giotto but it's essentially the same for

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:22.160 
giotto but it's essentially the same for
any<00:00:20.430> machine<00:00:20.789> with<00:00:21.359> a<00:00:21.390> three<00:00:21.779> way<00:00:21.930> solenoid

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:22.170 
any machine with a three way solenoid

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:24.769 
any machine with a three way solenoid
valve<00:00:22.680> you<00:00:23.130> can<00:00:23.160> only<00:00:23.580> back<00:00:24.060> flush<00:00:24.359> machines

00:00:24.769 --> 00:00:24.779 
valve you can only back flush machines

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:27.200 
valve you can only back flush machines
that<00:00:25.230> have<00:00:25.439> a<00:00:25.470> three<00:00:25.859> way<00:00:25.890> solenoid<00:00:26.279> if<00:00:26.730> you're

00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:27.210 
that have a three way solenoid if you're

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:30.740 
that have a three way solenoid if you're
not<00:00:27.420> sure<00:00:27.750> call<00:00:28.019> us<00:00:28.470> and<00:00:28.680> ask<00:00:29.029> so<00:00:30.029> essentially

00:00:32.179 --> 00:00:32.189 
what we do with bad flushing is we use a

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:34.280 
what we do with bad flushing is we use a
back<00:00:32.399> flush<00:00:32.669> insert<00:00:33.059> and<00:00:33.210> this<00:00:33.329> is<00:00:33.480> a<00:00:33.510> blind

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:34.290 
back flush insert and this is a blind

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:36.020 
back flush insert and this is a blind
basket<00:00:34.860> there's<00:00:35.100> no<00:00:35.190> holes<00:00:35.489> in<00:00:35.670> it<00:00:35.760> which<00:00:35.880> is

coffee tool which has a convenient spoon

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:06.710 
coffee tool which has a convenient spoon
on<00:01:05.040> the<00:01:05.159> back<00:01:05.339> which<00:01:05.790> gives<00:01:05.820> me<00:01:06.150> just<00:01:06.330> the

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:06.720 
on the back which gives me just the

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:07.940 
on the back which gives me just the
right<00:01:06.810> amount<00:01:07.229> so<00:01:07.409> I'm<00:01:07.500> going<00:01:07.650> to<00:01:07.710> put<00:01:07.830> that

engage<00:01:16.110> my<00:01:16.409> Porta<00:01:16.860> filter<00:01:16.890> into<00:01:17.340> the<00:01:17.460> group<00:01:18.530> so

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:19.530 
engage my Porta filter into the group so

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:21.230 
engage my Porta filter into the group so
what<00:01:19.950> I'm<00:01:20.070> going<00:01:20.310> to<00:01:20.369> do<00:01:20.580> is<00:01:20.820> I'm<00:01:20.970> just<00:01:21.000> going

00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:21.240 
what I'm going to do is I'm just going

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:23.210 
what I'm going to do is I'm just going
to<00:01:21.330> turn<00:01:21.509> the<00:01:21.689> pump<00:01:21.930> on<00:01:22.140> I'm<00:01:22.470> going<00:01:22.920> to<00:01:22.979> wait

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:23.220 
to turn the pump on I'm going to wait

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:25.249 
to turn the pump on I'm going to wait
about<00:01:23.490> 15<00:01:24.150> seconds<00:01:24.600> the<00:01:24.689> pump<00:01:24.869> is<00:01:24.960> going<00:01:25.080> to<00:01:25.170> go

00:01:25.249 --> 00:01:25.259 
about 15 seconds the pump is going to go

00:01:25.259 --> 00:01:27.440 
about 15 seconds the pump is going to go
quiet<00:01:25.650> and<00:01:25.950> what's<00:01:26.490> happening<00:01:26.970> inside<00:01:27.119> the

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:27.450 
quiet and what's happening inside the

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:29.750 
quiet and what's happening inside the
group<00:01:27.630> is<00:01:27.869> that<00:01:28.110> the

00:01:29.750 --> 00:01:29.760 
group is that the

00:01:29.760 --> 00:01:32.390 
group is that the
the<00:01:30.330> water<00:01:30.690> is<00:01:31.020> hitting<00:01:31.500> the<00:01:31.770> blind<00:01:32.070> the

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:32.400 
the water is hitting the blind the

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:34.130 
the water is hitting the blind the
basket<00:01:32.880> and<00:01:33.060> it's<00:01:33.210> being<00:01:33.360> forced<00:01:33.840> back

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:34.140 
basket and it's being forced back

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:36.770 
basket and it's being forced back
through<00:01:34.500> the<00:01:34.620> group<00:01:34.860> and<00:01:35.100> once<00:01:35.850> I<00:01:36.030> release<00:01:36.480> the

through the group and once I release the

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:38.960 
through the group and once I release the
lever<00:01:37.020> you're<00:01:37.590> gonna<00:01:37.740> see<00:01:38.040> detergent<00:01:38.760> come

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:38.970 
lever you're gonna see detergent come

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:40.670 
lever you're gonna see detergent come
out<00:01:39.090> of<00:01:39.210> my<00:01:39.300> three<00:01:39.570> way<00:01:39.690> solenoid<00:01:39.900> valve<00:01:40.500> which

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:40.680 
out of my three way solenoid valve which

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:42.650 
out of my three way solenoid valve which
on<00:01:40.890> the<00:01:40.980> e60<00:01:41.640> one<00:01:41.820> is<00:01:42.030> right<00:01:42.270> here

00:01:42.650 --> 00:01:42.660 
on the e60 one is right here

00:01:42.660 --> 00:01:44.720 
on the e60 one is right here
but<00:01:43.020> not<00:01:43.290> every<00:01:43.530> machine<00:01:43.710> has<00:01:43.860> that<00:01:44.400> sub

00:01:44.720 --> 00:01:44.730 
but not every machine has that sub

00:01:44.730 --> 00:01:47.420 
but not every machine has that sub
machines<00:01:45.380> as<00:01:46.380> some<00:01:46.710> machines<00:01:47.040> have<00:01:47.190> a<00:01:47.220> three

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:47.430 
machines as some machines have a three

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:49.250 
machines as some machines have a three
way<00:01:47.460> solenoid<00:01:47.730> like<00:01:48.330> a<00:01:48.420> tube<00:01:48.690> or<00:01:49.020> something

00:01:49.250 --> 00:01:49.260 
way solenoid like a tube or something

00:01:49.260 --> 00:01:51.170

like<00:01:49.320> that<00:01:49.380> going<00:01:49.830> into<00:01:49.950> a<00:01:50.070> drip<00:01:50.340> drip<00:01:50.580> and<00:01:50.760> I'm

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:51.180 
like that going into a drip drip and I'm

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:53.090 
like that going into a drip drip and I'm
gonna<00:01:51.330> do<00:01:51.510> this<00:01:51.660> about<00:01:51.810> you<00:01:52.530> know<00:01:52.620> but<00:01:52.830> five<00:01:53.070> or

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:53.100 
gonna do this about you know but five or

00:01:53.100 --> 00:02:04.240 
gonna do this about you know but five or
six<00:01:53.490> times
