hey folks a shell thing sentry comm
we're<00:00:03.480> gonna<00:00:03.570> talk<00:00:03.750> about<00:00:03.780> what's<00:00:04.560> called<00:00:04.770> a

00:00:04.849 --> 00:00:04.859 
we're gonna talk about what's called a

00:00:04.859 --> 00:00:07.220 
we're gonna talk about what's called a
cast<00:00:05.130> stop<00:00:05.400> or<00:00:05.580> also<00:00:06.089> known<00:00:06.240> some<00:00:06.660> places<00:00:07.049> as<00:00:07.200> a

00:00:07.220 --> 00:00:07.230 
cast stop or also known some places as a

00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:10.400 
cast stop or also known some places as a
tissue<00:00:07.470> stuff<00:00:07.820> now<00:00:08.820> we're<00:00:08.970> about<00:00:09.059> to<00:00:09.410> process

00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:10.410 
tissue stuff now we're about to process

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:11.540 
tissue stuff now we're about to process
the<00:00:10.559> acrylic<00:00:10.950> and<00:00:11.040> the<00:00:11.130> denture<00:00:11.400> teeth

00:00:11.540 --> 00:00:11.550 
the acrylic and the denture teeth

00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:13.039 
the acrylic and the denture teeth
they're<00:00:11.759> not<00:00:11.849> on<00:00:12.059> here<00:00:12.179> yet<00:00:12.389> but<00:00:12.540> they<00:00:12.660> soon

00:00:13.039 --> 00:00:13.049 
they're not on here yet but they soon

00:00:13.049 --> 00:00:15.829 
they're not on here yet but they soon
will<00:00:13.259> be<00:00:13.440> I'll<00:00:14.130> wax<00:00:14.340> them<00:00:14.549> up<00:00:14.639> and<00:00:14.880> often

00:00:15.829 --> 00:00:15.839 
will be I'll wax them up and often

00:00:15.839 --> 00:00:17.000 
will be I'll wax them up and often
especially<00:00:16.350> when<00:00:16.440> I<00:00:16.470> was<00:00:16.590> in<00:00:16.710> dental<00:00:16.920> school

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:17.010 
especially when I was in dental school

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:18.140 
especially when I was in dental school
this<00:00:17.279> is<00:00:17.340> what<00:00:17.520> they<00:00:17.640> used<00:00:17.789> to<00:00:17.850> call<00:00:18.060> this

00:00:18.140 --> 00:00:18.150 
this is what they used to call this

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:20.990 
this is what they used to call this
little<00:00:18.420> friend<00:00:18.660> here<00:00:18.900> a<00:00:19.400> tissue<00:00:20.400> stuff<00:00:20.730> I

00:00:20.990 --> 00:00:21.000 
little friend here a tissue stuff I

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.830 
little friend here a tissue stuff I
never<00:00:22.160> understood<00:00:23.160> it<00:00:23.359> while<00:00:24.359> I<00:00:24.420> was<00:00:24.570> called<00:00:24.779> a

00:00:24.830 --> 00:00:24.840 
never understood it while I was called a

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:26.089 
never understood it while I was called a
tissue<00:00:25.050> stop<00:00:25.320> on<00:00:25.470> a<00:00:25.500> distal<00:00:25.830> extension

00:00:26.089 --> 00:00:26.099 
tissue stop on a distal extension

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:28.310 
tissue stop on a distal extension
because<00:00:26.849> it<00:00:27.090> never<00:00:27.480> seemed<00:00:27.750> to<00:00:27.840> me<00:00:27.990> that<00:00:28.199> it

00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:28.320 
because it never seemed to me that it

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:30.859 
because it never seemed to me that it
would<00:00:28.380> be<00:00:28.439> touching<00:00:28.740> tissue<00:00:29.510> maybe<00:00:30.510> a<00:00:30.630> little

00:00:30.859 --> 00:00:30.869 
would be touching tissue maybe a little

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:32.109 
would be touching tissue maybe a little
bit<00:00:30.990> but

00:00:32.109 --> 00:00:32.119 
bit but

00:00:32.119 --> 00:00:36.160 
bit but
so<00:00:32.750> actually<00:00:33.580> the<00:00:34.580> real<00:00:35.240> thing<00:00:35.780> that<00:00:35.810> this<00:00:36.050> is

00:00:36.160 --> 00:00:36.170 
so actually the real thing that this is

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:38.110 
so actually the real thing that this is
called<00:00:36.410> is<00:00:36.470> going<00:00:36.650> to<00:00:36.710> cast<00:00:36.920> up<00:00:37.160> the<00:00:37.880> reason

00:00:38.110 --> 00:00:38.120 
called is going to cast up the reason

00:00:38.120 --> 00:00:40.530 
called is going to cast up the reason
why<00:00:38.360> is<00:00:38.420> because<00:00:38.570> when<00:00:38.870> you're<00:00:39.020> placing

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:40.540 
why is because when you're placing

00:00:40.540 --> 00:00:43.600 
why is because when you're placing
packing<00:00:41.570> that's<00:00:42.350> much<00:00:42.500> packing<00:00:42.950> but<00:00:43.100> placing

00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:43.610 
packing that's much packing but placing

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:48.939 
packing that's much packing but placing
wax<00:00:44.210> and<00:00:45.220> while<00:00:46.220> packing<00:00:46.640> to<00:00:47.800> want<00:00:48.800> to<00:00:48.860> make

00:00:48.939 --> 00:00:48.949 
wax and while packing to want to make

00:00:48.949 --> 00:00:50.500 
wax and while packing to want to make
sure<00:00:49.100> that<00:00:49.280> that<00:00:49.460> distal<00:00:49.820> extension<00:00:50.030> doesn't

00:00:50.500 --> 00:00:50.510 
sure that that distal extension doesn't

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:53.710 
sure that that distal extension doesn't
Rock<00:00:50.720> so<00:00:51.140> it<00:00:51.320> is<00:00:51.500> the<00:00:51.680> positive<00:00:51.980> stop<00:00:52.760> on<00:00:53.570> your

00:00:53.710 --> 00:00:53.720 
Rock so it is the positive stop on your

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:57.869 
Rock so it is the positive stop on your
cast<00:00:55.270> absolutely<00:00:56.270> out<00:00:56.390> too<00:00:56.540> much<00:00:56.660> too<00:00:57.379> much

00:00:57.869 --> 00:00:57.879 
cast absolutely out too much too much

00:00:57.879 --> 00:01:01.290 
cast absolutely out too much too much
there<00:00:58.879> we<00:00:58.970> go<00:00:59.090> so<00:00:59.330> you<00:00:59.420> can<00:00:59.510> see<00:00:59.690> that<00:00:59.840> that<00:01:00.020> is

00:01:01.290 --> 00:01:01.300 
there we go so you can see that that is

00:01:01.300 --> 00:01:03.910 
there we go so you can see that that is
keeping<00:01:02.300> the<00:01:02.449> space<00:01:02.780> maintaining<00:01:03.620> the<00:01:03.710> space

00:01:03.910 --> 00:01:03.920 
keeping the space maintaining the space

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:07.330 
keeping the space maintaining the space
between<00:01:04.160> the<00:01:05.229> framework<00:01:06.229> and<00:01:06.440> the<00:01:06.770> cast<00:01:07.040> so<00:01:07.310> I

00:01:07.330 --> 00:01:07.340 
between the framework and the cast so I

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:10.690 
between the framework and the cast so I
can<00:01:07.550> flow<00:01:07.899> wax<00:01:08.899> under<00:01:09.110> there<00:01:09.440> under<00:01:09.680> excuse<00:01:10.550> me

00:01:10.690 --> 00:01:10.700 
can flow wax under there under excuse me

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:14.550 
can flow wax under there under excuse me
underneath<00:01:11.000> the<00:01:11.420> framework<00:01:12.190> in<00:01:13.190> an<00:01:13.700> effort<00:01:14.060> to

00:01:14.550 --> 00:01:14.560 
underneath the framework in an effort to

00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:18.590 
underneath the framework in an effort to
then<00:01:15.580> it's<00:01:16.580> hard<00:01:16.850> to<00:01:16.910> see<00:01:17.000> there<00:01:17.270> you<00:01:17.360> go

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:18.600 
then it's hard to see there you go

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:21.560 
then it's hard to see there you go
an<00:01:19.020> effort<00:01:19.350> to<00:01:19.530> then<00:01:19.860> have<00:01:20.360> ensure<00:01:21.360> that<00:01:21.450> we

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:21.570 
an effort to then have ensure that we

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:23.300 
an effort to then have ensure that we
have<00:01:21.690> acrylic<00:01:22.110> packed<00:01:22.530> all<00:01:22.770> the<00:01:22.979> way<00:01:23.070> around

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:23.310 
have acrylic packed all the way around

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:27.200 
have acrylic packed all the way around
this<00:01:23.490> framework<00:01:25.280> so<00:01:26.280> it's<00:01:26.460> not<00:01:26.610> a<00:01:26.640> tissue<00:01:26.910> stop

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:27.210 
this framework so it's not a tissue stop

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:29.719 
this framework so it's not a tissue stop
it's<00:01:27.420> a<00:01:27.479> cast<00:01:27.750> stop<00:01:28.080> and<00:01:28.530> so<00:01:29.400> we're<00:01:29.520> gonna<00:01:29.610> be

00:01:29.719 --> 00:01:29.729 
it's a cast stop and so we're gonna be

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:32.540 
it's a cast stop and so we're gonna be
doing<00:01:29.820> now<00:01:30.120> with<00:01:30.330> this<00:01:30.979> partial<00:01:31.979> denture<00:01:32.280> is

00:01:32.540 --> 00:01:32.550 
doing now with this partial denture is

00:01:32.550 --> 00:01:36.350 
doing now with this partial denture is
in<00:01:33.240> waxing<00:01:33.780> up<00:01:33.840> the<00:01:33.960> teeth<00:01:34.200> and<00:01:35.360> another

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:36.360 
in waxing up the teeth and another

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:37.940 
in waxing up the teeth and another
couple<00:01:36.690> things<00:01:37.050> that<00:01:37.260> we<00:01:37.410> have<00:01:37.590> we<00:01:37.770> have<00:01:37.920> a

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:37.950 
couple things that we have we have a

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:39.740 
couple things that we have we have a
healing<00:01:38.520> abutment<00:01:39.000> if<00:01:39.090> you<00:01:39.180> haven't<00:01:39.450> seen

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:39.750 
healing abutment if you haven't seen

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:41.270 
healing abutment if you haven't seen
this<00:01:39.900> is<00:01:40.050> a<00:01:40.080> few<00:01:40.320> other<00:01:40.440> videos<00:01:40.740> online

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:41.280 
this is a few other videos online

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:43.940 
this is a few other videos online
talking<00:01:41.880> about<00:01:42.030> the<00:01:42.150> design<00:01:42.570> of<00:01:42.750> this<00:01:42.950> using

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:43.950 
talking about the design of this using

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:45.170 
talking about the design of this using
this<00:01:44.040> healing<00:01:44.340> abutment<00:01:44.700> as<00:01:44.820> a<00:01:44.850> positive

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:45.180 
this healing abutment as a positive

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:51.320 
this healing abutment as a positive
vertical<00:01:45.840> stop<00:01:46.050> and<00:01:46.430> we're<00:01:47.430> going<00:01:47.670> to<00:01:50.090> wax<00:01:51.090> up

00:01:51.320 --> 00:01:51.330 
vertical stop and we're going to wax up

00:01:51.330 --> 00:01:53.630 
vertical stop and we're going to wax up
the<00:01:51.479> denture<00:01:51.930> pearl<00:01:52.380> assess<00:01:52.740> it<00:01:52.950> with<00:01:53.520> the

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:53.640 
the denture pearl assess it with the

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:56.330 
the denture pearl assess it with the
acrylic<00:01:53.910> and<00:01:54.320> then<00:01:55.320> try<00:01:55.649> in<00:01:55.710> each<00:01:55.890> orally<00:01:56.250> and

00:01:56.330 --> 00:01:56.340 
acrylic and then try in each orally and

00:01:56.340 --> 00:01:57.770 
acrylic and then try in each orally and
now<00:01:56.460> most<00:01:56.759> like<00:01:57.000> I'm<00:01:57.149> going<00:01:57.390> to<00:01:57.509> have<00:01:57.660> to

00:01:57.770 --> 00:01:57.780 
now most like I'm going to have to

00:01:57.780 --> 00:01:59.840 
now most like I'm going to have to
realign<00:01:58.350> this<00:01:58.680> intro<00:01:59.070> orally<00:01:59.399> because<00:01:59.520> what

00:01:59.840 --> 00:01:59.850 
realign this intro orally because what

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:02.960 
realign this intro orally because what
happens<00:02:00.180> is<00:02:00.390> all<00:02:00.860> plastic<00:02:01.860> shrink<00:02:02.250> including

00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:02.970 
happens is all plastic shrink including

00:02:02.970 --> 00:02:04.670 
happens is all plastic shrink including
acrylic<00:02:03.330> so<00:02:03.539> they're<00:02:03.660> gonna<00:02:03.780> this<00:02:04.289> probably

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:04.680 
acrylic so they're gonna this probably

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:06.740 
acrylic so they're gonna this probably
won't<00:02:04.830> fit<00:02:05.220> as<00:02:05.430> it<00:02:05.670> does<00:02:05.850> on<00:02:06.090> this<00:02:06.360> impression

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:06.750 
won't fit as it does on this impression

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:10.669 
won't fit as it does on this impression
so<00:02:07.050> we'll<00:02:07.170> have<00:02:07.289> to<00:02:09.320> remove<00:02:10.320> some<00:02:10.560> of<00:02:10.590> the

00:02:10.669 --> 00:02:10.679 
so we'll have to remove some of the

00:02:10.679 --> 00:02:12.440 
so we'll have to remove some of the
acrylic<00:02:10.890> from<00:02:11.070> the<00:02:11.220> internal<00:02:11.790> type<00:02:12.300> of

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:12.450 
acrylic from the internal type of

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:14.089 
acrylic from the internal type of
surface<00:02:12.750> of<00:02:12.870> the

00:02:17.209 --> 00:02:17.219 
the denture base here and then realign

00:02:17.219 --> 00:02:20.690 
the denture base here and then realign
with<00:02:17.459> whatever<00:02:18.359> acrylic<00:02:19.069> clinic<00:02:20.069> chair<00:02:20.489> side

with whatever acrylic clinic chair side

00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:23.479 
with whatever acrylic clinic chair side
we're<00:02:21.269> also<00:02:21.390> going<00:02:21.569> to<00:02:21.629> fill<00:02:21.840> in<00:02:22.079> all<00:02:22.370> the<00:02:23.370> way

00:02:23.479 --> 00:02:23.489 
we're also going to fill in all the way

00:02:23.489 --> 00:02:25.910 
we're also going to fill in all the way
to<00:02:23.549> the<00:02:23.909> most<00:02:24.629> single<00:02:24.930> portion<00:02:25.290> inferior

to the most single portion inferior
portion<00:02:26.209> with<00:02:27.209> acrylic<00:02:27.629> and<00:02:27.870> then<00:02:28.019> cut<00:02:28.980> back

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:29.010 
portion with acrylic and then cut back

00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:32.089 
portion with acrylic and then cut back
as<00:02:29.400> we<00:02:29.549> need<00:02:29.730> to<00:02:29.939> into<00:02:30.870> orally<00:02:31.200> now<00:02:31.859> the<00:02:31.920> last

00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:36.180 
talked about our cast up you know just

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:39.800 
talked about our cast up you know just
flow<00:02:36.390> wax<00:02:36.629> around<00:02:36.810> this<00:02:38.090> is<00:02:39.090> the<00:02:39.299> finish<00:02:39.599> line

00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:39.810 
flow wax around this is the finish line

00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:43.449 
flow wax around this is the finish line
so<00:02:40.709> you<00:02:40.769> can<00:02:40.859> see<00:02:41.010> these<00:02:41.400> things<00:02:41.639> here<00:02:42.120> these

so you can see now I've got now I place

00:03:41.210 --> 00:03:43.810 
so you can see now I've got now I place
some<00:03:41.410> wax<00:03:42.410> onto<00:03:42.740> the<00:03:42.950> cast<00:03:43.190> and<00:03:43.520> then<00:03:43.580> just

00:03:43.810 --> 00:03:43.820 
some wax onto the cast and then just

00:03:43.820 --> 00:03:45.370 
some wax onto the cast and then just
warmed<00:03:44.060> up<00:03:44.150> my<00:03:44.270> framework<00:03:44.540> a<00:03:44.750> little<00:03:44.930> bit<00:03:45.050> and

00:03:45.370 --> 00:03:45.380 
warmed up my framework a little bit and

00:03:45.380 --> 00:03:49.390 
warmed up my framework a little bit and
flowed<00:03:45.620> ensure<00:03:46.280> that<00:03:46.400> there's<00:03:46.670> a<00:03:48.400> limited

00:03:49.390 --> 00:03:49.400 
flowed ensure that there's a limited

00:03:49.400 --> 00:03:51.280 
flowed ensure that there's a limited
amount<00:03:49.670> of<00:03:50.150> porosity<00:03:50.450> underneath<00:03:51.020> here<00:03:51.230> in

00:03:51.280 --> 00:03:51.290 
amount of porosity underneath here in

00:03:51.290 --> 00:03:54.670 
amount of porosity underneath here in
wax<00:03:51.530> and<00:03:51.770> you<00:03:52.220> can<00:03:52.370> see<00:03:53.020> that<00:03:54.020> the<00:03:54.140> idea<00:03:54.440> now

00:03:54.670 --> 00:03:54.680 
wax and you can see that the idea now

00:03:54.680 --> 00:03:58.300 
wax and you can see that the idea now
for<00:03:55.250> the<00:03:55.430> cast<00:03:56.090> off<00:03:56.330> is<00:03:56.510> to<00:03:56.660> make<00:03:56.780> sure<00:03:56.810> that<00:03:57.310> we

00:03:58.300 --> 00:03:58.310 
for the cast off is to make sure that we

00:03:58.310 --> 00:04:01.570 
for the cast off is to make sure that we
can<00:03:58.460> get<00:03:58.780> wax<00:03:59.780> and<00:04:00.260> then<00:04:00.380> well<00:04:00.650> which<00:04:01.430> will

00:04:01.570 --> 00:04:01.580 
can get wax and then well which will

00:04:01.580 --> 00:04:03.640 
can get wax and then well which will
then<00:04:01.700> turn<00:04:01.880> it<00:04:02.060> to<00:04:02.180> be<00:04:02.270> burned<00:04:02.660> out<00:04:02.810> and<00:04:03.080> in

00:04:03.640 --> 00:04:03.650 
then turn it to be burned out and in

00:04:03.650 --> 00:04:07.660 
then turn it to be burned out and in
Flast<00:04:03.950> and<00:04:04.370> have<00:04:04.570> acrylic<00:04:05.570> underneath<00:04:06.670> the

00:04:07.660 --> 00:04:07.670 
Flast and have acrylic underneath the

00:04:07.670 --> 00:04:10.300 
Flast and have acrylic underneath the
framework<00:04:08.590> which<00:04:09.590> will<00:04:09.710> then<00:04:09.860> act<00:04:10.070> does<00:04:10.220> the

00:04:10.300 --> 00:04:10.310 
framework which will then act does the

00:04:10.310 --> 00:04:12.220 
framework which will then act does the
intake<00:04:10.550> of<00:04:10.610> the<00:04:10.730> surface<00:04:11.090> of<00:04:11.240> this<00:04:11.420> denture

00:04:12.220 --> 00:04:12.230 
intake of the surface of this denture

00:04:12.230 --> 00:04:14.620 
intake of the surface of this denture
base<00:04:12.280> so<00:04:13.280> the<00:04:13.340> next<00:04:13.520> stage<00:04:13.730> is<00:04:13.760> to<00:04:14.120> continue

00:04:14.620 --> 00:04:14.630 
base so the next stage is to continue
