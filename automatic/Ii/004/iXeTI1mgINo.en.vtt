00:01:35.590 --> 00:01:35.600 
left it pretty much enables the part

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:38.320 
left it pretty much enables the part
where<00:01:35.840> the<00:01:36.380> cops<00:01:36.680> turned<00:01:37.430> blind<00:01:37.730> I<00:01:37.970> just

00:01:38.320 --> 00:01:38.330 
where the cops turned blind I just

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:40.480 
where the cops turned blind I just
completely<00:01:38.810> stays<00:01:39.230> on<00:01:39.470> and<00:01:39.740> it<00:01:40.160> doesn't

00:01:40.480 --> 00:01:40.490 
completely stays on and it doesn't

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:43.240 
completely stays on and it doesn't
affect<00:01:40.910> anything<00:01:41.330> in<00:01:41.870> regards<00:01:42.380> to<00:01:42.770> the<00:01:42.800> police

00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:43.250 
affect anything in regards to the police

00:01:43.250 --> 00:01:44.890 
affect anything in regards to the police
coming<00:01:43.520> on<00:01:43.760> which<00:01:44.000> is<00:01:44.120> really<00:01:44.390> weird<00:01:44.660> because

00:01:44.890 --> 00:01:44.900 
coming on which is really weird because

00:01:44.900 --> 00:01:46.540 
coming on which is really weird because
I<00:01:45.080> mean<00:01:45.350> all<00:01:45.740> you're<00:01:45.950> really<00:01:45.980> doing<00:01:46.160> is

00:01:46.540 --> 00:01:46.550 
I mean all you're really doing is

00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:49.090 
I mean all you're really doing is
flipping<00:01:47.030> out<00:01:47.180> your<00:01:47.420> phone<00:01:47.690> but<00:01:48.500> this<00:01:48.920> is<00:01:49.070> a

00:01:49.090 --> 00:01:49.100 
flipping out your phone but this is a

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:50.800 
flipping out your phone but this is a
really<00:01:49.370> cool<00:01:49.520> glitch<00:01:49.790> the<00:01:49.970> only<00:01:50.120> downside<00:01:50.600> is

00:01:50.800 --> 00:01:50.810 
really cool glitch the only downside is

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:52.570 
really cool glitch the only downside is
obviously<00:01:51.440> you<00:01:51.560> have<00:01:51.710> to<00:01:51.830> be<00:01:51.920> in<00:01:52.040> the<00:01:52.130> vehicle

00:01:52.570 --> 00:01:52.580 
obviously you have to be in the vehicle

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:55.150 
obviously you have to be in the vehicle
and<00:01:52.760> you<00:01:53.240> also<00:01:53.450> can<00:01:54.020> arm<00:01:54.350> only<00:01:54.680> be<00:01:54.800> stuck<00:01:55.040> with

00:01:55.150 --> 00:01:55.160 
and you also can arm only be stuck with

00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:56.320 
and you also can arm only be stuck with
one<00:01:55.340> weapon<00:01:55.700> and<00:01:55.790> while<00:01:55.880> you're<00:01:56.000> doing<00:01:56.120> this

00:01:56.320 --> 00:01:56.330 
one weapon and while you're doing this

00:01:56.330 --> 00:01:57.760 
one weapon and while you're doing this
but<00:01:56.510> I<00:01:56.750> mean<00:01:56.990> they're<00:01:57.110> really<00:01:57.260> upside<00:01:57.590> is<00:01:57.740> you

00:01:57.760 --> 00:01:57.770 
but I mean they're really upside is you

00:01:57.770 --> 00:01:59.590 
but I mean they're really upside is you
can<00:01:58.010> pretty<00:01:58.220> much<00:01:58.340> have<00:01:58.580> some<00:01:58.760> fun<00:01:58.970> and<00:01:59.210> just

00:01:59.590 --> 00:01:59.600 
can pretty much have some fun and just

00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:01.750 
can pretty much have some fun and just
kill<00:01:59.870> people<00:02:00.260> shoot<00:02:00.590> people<00:02:00.980> and<00:02:01.070> you<00:02:01.280> won't

00:02:01.750 --> 00:02:01.760 
kill people shoot people and you won't

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:04.150 
kill people shoot people and you won't
have<00:02:01.820> any<00:02:01.970> issues<00:02:02.330> with<00:02:02.360> the<00:02:02.570> police<00:02:03.010> this<00:02:04.010> is

00:02:04.150 --> 00:02:04.160 
have any issues with the police this is

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:05.980 
have any issues with the police this is
pretty<00:02:04.370> much<00:02:04.580> I<00:02:04.760> guess<00:02:05.030> the<00:02:05.180> closest<00:02:05.630> thing<00:02:05.810> we

00:02:05.980 --> 00:02:05.990 
pretty much I guess the closest thing we

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:08.770 
pretty much I guess the closest thing we
can<00:02:06.170> get<00:02:06.350> so<00:02:06.590> far<00:02:06.890> to<00:02:07.550> a<00:02:07.580> note

00:02:08.770 --> 00:02:08.780 
can get so far to a note

00:02:08.780 --> 00:02:10.960 
can get so far to a note
or<00:02:09.200> a<00:02:09.259> no<00:02:09.740> like<00:02:10.039> I<00:02:10.190> guess<00:02:10.340> what<00:02:10.550> they<00:02:10.640> call<00:02:10.789> like

00:02:10.960 --> 00:02:10.970 
or a no like I guess what they call like

00:02:10.970 --> 00:02:12.400 
or a no like I guess what they call like
a<00:02:11.060> sandbox<00:02:11.540> mode<00:02:11.750> or<00:02:12.050> something<00:02:12.290> like<00:02:12.350> that

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:12.410 
a sandbox mode or something like that

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:14.350 
a sandbox mode or something like that
where<00:02:12.800> you<00:02:13.250> know<00:02:13.370> you<00:02:13.430> could<00:02:13.640> turn<00:02:13.880> off<00:02:14.150> the

00:02:14.350 --> 00:02:14.360 
where you know you could turn off the

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:16.750 
where you know you could turn off the
police<00:02:14.569> now<00:02:14.990> I<00:02:15.020> really<00:02:15.440> feel<00:02:15.680> that<00:02:15.760> hopefully

00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:16.760 
police now I really feel that hopefully

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:18.970 
police now I really feel that hopefully
one<00:02:16.970> day<00:02:17.000> rocks<00:02:17.600> are<00:02:17.810> does<00:02:18.020> enable<00:02:18.260> some<00:02:18.680> sort

00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:18.980 
one day rocks are does enable some sort

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:20.980 
one day rocks are does enable some sort
of<00:02:19.069> a<00:02:19.280> game<00:02:19.670> mode<00:02:19.880> where<00:02:20.090> you<00:02:20.330> don't<00:02:20.660> have<00:02:20.810> to

00:02:20.980 --> 00:02:20.990 
of a game mode where you don't have to

00:02:20.990 --> 00:02:22.480 
of a game mode where you don't have to
deal<00:02:21.170> with<00:02:21.319> the<00:02:21.440> police<00:02:21.709> you<00:02:22.010> won't<00:02:22.190> have<00:02:22.340> to

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:22.490 
deal with the police you won't have to
