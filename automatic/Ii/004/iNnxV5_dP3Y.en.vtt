00:00:02.440 --> 00:00:05.490 

I<00:00:03.030> think<00:00:04.030> the<00:00:04.150> mat<00:00:04.300> board<00:00:04.540> is<00:00:04.690> worth<00:00:04.900> a<00:00:05.200> closer

00:00:05.490 --> 00:00:05.500 
I think the mat board is worth a closer

00:00:05.500 --> 00:00:07.679 
I think the mat board is worth a closer
look<00:00:05.890> because<00:00:06.190> I<00:00:06.670> really<00:00:07.029> loved<00:00:07.240> the<00:00:07.359> design

00:00:07.679 --> 00:00:07.689 
look because I really loved the design

00:00:07.689 --> 00:00:10.110 
look because I really loved the design
of<00:00:07.899> this<00:00:08.019> mat<00:00:08.290> board<00:00:08.560> and<00:00:09.190> for<00:00:09.430> example<00:00:09.820> Spain

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:10.120 
of this mat board and for example Spain

00:00:10.120 --> 00:00:12.720 
of this mat board and for example Spain
there<00:00:10.420> really<00:00:10.660> catches<00:00:11.290> the<00:00:11.730> mountainous

00:00:12.720 --> 00:00:12.730 
there really catches the mountainous

00:00:12.730 --> 00:00:16.460 
there really catches the mountainous
Spain<00:00:13.679> you've<00:00:14.679> got<00:00:15.009> the<00:00:15.370> importance<00:00:15.910> of

00:00:16.460 --> 00:00:16.470 
Spain you've got the importance of

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:19.490 
Spain you've got the importance of
fighting<00:00:17.470> over<00:00:17.650> the<00:00:17.770> French<00:00:17.980> rivers<00:00:18.430> there

00:00:19.490 --> 00:00:19.500 
fighting over the French rivers there

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:23.310 
fighting over the French rivers there
you've<00:00:20.500> got<00:00:20.529> the<00:00:20.800> forests<00:00:21.369> as<00:00:21.699> they<00:00:21.970> were<00:00:22.320> in

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:23.320 
you've got the forests as they were in

00:00:23.320 --> 00:00:26.580 
you've got the forests as they were in
the<00:00:23.640> what<00:00:24.640> yes<00:00:24.789> is<00:00:25.060> actually<00:00:25.539> then<00:00:26.080> the<00:00:26.410> Holy

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:26.590 
the what yes is actually then the Holy

00:00:26.590 --> 00:00:29.310 
the what yes is actually then the Holy
Roman<00:00:26.830> Empire<00:00:27.420> kind<00:00:28.420> of<00:00:28.509> just<00:00:28.720> after<00:00:29.050> the<00:00:29.140> Holy

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:29.320 
Roman Empire kind of just after the Holy

00:00:29.320 --> 00:00:30.029 
Roman Empire kind of just after the Holy
Roman<00:00:29.529> Empire

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:30.039 
Roman Empire

00:00:30.039 --> 00:00:32.429 
Roman Empire
so<00:00:30.820> quite<00:00:31.060> it's<00:00:31.240> quite<00:00:31.300> fragmented<00:00:31.960> that's

00:00:32.429 --> 00:00:32.439 
so quite it's quite fragmented that's

00:00:32.439 --> 00:00:34.410 
so quite it's quite fragmented that's
the<00:00:32.529> point<00:00:32.680> I'm<00:00:32.860> trying<00:00:32.890> to<00:00:33.100> make<00:00:33.190> there<00:00:33.610> you

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:34.420 
the point I'm trying to make there you

00:00:34.420 --> 00:00:36.540 
the point I'm trying to make there you
can<00:00:34.540> see<00:00:34.719> Holland<00:00:35.260> but<00:00:35.410> you<00:00:35.500> can<00:00:35.620> see<00:00:35.829> hanover

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:36.550 
can see Holland but you can see hanover

00:00:36.550 --> 00:00:39.420 
can see Holland but you can see hanover
denmark<00:00:37.480> and<00:00:38.260> then<00:00:38.410> teach<00:00:38.649> you<00:00:38.829> little<00:00:39.100> states

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:39.430 
denmark and then teach you little states

00:00:39.430 --> 00:00:41.069 
denmark and then teach you little states
like<00:00:39.670> brunswick<00:00:40.420> they<00:00:40.660> all<00:00:40.809> had<00:00:40.930> their<00:00:41.020> own

00:00:41.069 --> 00:00:41.079 
like brunswick they all had their own

00:00:41.079 --> 00:00:45.420 
like brunswick they all had their own
armies<00:00:43.079> saxony<00:00:44.079> see<00:00:44.980> the<00:00:45.100> way<00:00:45.190> it's<00:00:45.309> all

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:45.430 
armies saxony see the way it's all

00:00:45.430 --> 00:00:48.990 
armies saxony see the way it's all
broken<00:00:45.850> up<00:00:45.940> there<00:00:46.649> then<00:00:47.649> out<00:00:47.800> to<00:00:48.070> russia<00:00:48.550> and

00:00:48.990 --> 00:00:49.000 
broken up there then out to russia and

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:54.110 
broken up there then out to russia and
then<00:00:49.629> into<00:00:49.989> the<00:00:50.110> wastelands<00:00:50.620> of<00:00:51.280> russia<00:00:52.149> and

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:54.120 
then into the wastelands of russia and

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:56.700 
then into the wastelands of russia and
overall<00:00:55.120> the<00:00:55.270> map<00:00:55.449> is<00:00:55.629> presented<00:00:56.170> in<00:00:56.350> a<00:00:56.440> quite

00:00:56.700 --> 00:00:56.710 
overall the map is presented in a quite

00:00:56.710 --> 00:01:00.299 
overall the map is presented in a quite
simple<00:00:57.280> way<00:00:57.960> so<00:00:58.960> when<00:00:59.440> you<00:00:59.559> get<00:00:59.710> down<00:00:59.890> to<00:00:59.949> it

00:01:00.299 --> 00:01:00.309 
simple way so when you get down to it

00:01:00.309 --> 00:01:04.020 
simple way so when you get down to it
you<00:01:00.820> will<00:01:01.000> be<00:01:01.180> having<00:01:01.359> the<00:01:01.600> usual<00:01:03.030> strategic

00:01:04.020 --> 00:01:04.030 
you will be having the usual strategic

00:01:04.030 --> 00:01:06.210 
you will be having the usual strategic
level<00:01:04.410> considerations<00:01:05.410> of<00:01:05.680> how<00:01:05.860> to<00:01:05.920> break

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:06.220 
level considerations of how to break

00:01:06.220 --> 00:01:08.160 
level considerations of how to break
through<00:01:06.460> the<00:01:06.640> frontline<00:01:07.080> bringing<00:01:08.080> up

00:01:08.160 --> 00:01:08.170 
through the frontline bringing up

00:01:08.170 --> 00:01:10.770 
through the frontline bringing up
reserves<00:01:08.880> and<00:01:09.880> perhaps<00:01:10.120> if<00:01:10.330> i<00:01:10.390> take<00:01:10.600> you

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:10.780 
reserves and perhaps if i take you

00:01:10.780 --> 00:01:13.110 
reserves and perhaps if i take you
through<00:01:10.990> the<00:01:11.140> scenarios<00:01:11.680> in<00:01:11.830> a<00:01:11.920> second<00:01:12.370> you'll

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:13.120 
through the scenarios in a second you'll

00:01:13.120 --> 00:01:16.470 
through the scenarios in a second you'll
get<00:01:13.300> to<00:01:13.570> get<00:01:13.960> a<00:01:13.990> feel<00:01:14.320> for<00:01:15.000> different<00:01:16.000> types<00:01:16.270> of

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:16.480 
get to get a feel for different types of

00:01:16.480 --> 00:01:19.100 
get to get a feel for different types of
games<00:01:16.810> within<00:01:17.710> an<00:01:17.830> overall<00:01:17.950> game<00:01:18.460> structure

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:19.110 
games within an overall game structure

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:22.620 
games within an overall game structure
now<00:01:20.110> the<00:01:20.170> first<00:01:20.500> scenario<00:01:20.830> is<00:01:21.730> ousted<00:01:22.150> it's

00:01:22.620 --> 00:01:22.630 
now the first scenario is ousted it's

00:01:22.630 --> 00:01:25.590 
now the first scenario is ousted it's
1805<00:01:23.590> and<00:01:24.000> actually<00:01:25.000> it<00:01:25.060> has<00:01:25.090> to<00:01:25.300> be<00:01:25.360> said<00:01:25.570> that

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:25.600 
1805 and actually it has to be said that

00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:27.360 
1805 and actually it has to be said that
most<00:01:25.900> scenarios<00:01:26.230> will<00:01:26.650> be<00:01:26.740> played<00:01:27.010> over<00:01:27.220> the

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:27.370 
most scenarios will be played over the

00:01:27.370 --> 00:01:29.130 
most scenarios will be played over the
center<00:01:27.700> for<00:01:27.820> two<00:01:28.030> balls<00:01:28.300> there<00:01:28.630> sometimes

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:29.140 
center for two balls there sometimes

00:01:29.140 --> 00:01:31.050 
center for two balls there sometimes
you'll<00:01:29.320> go<00:01:29.500> across<00:01:29.740> to<00:01:30.040> spain<00:01:30.370> and<00:01:30.640> get<00:01:30.790> three

00:01:31.050 --> 00:01:31.060 
you'll go across to spain and get three

00:01:31.060 --> 00:01:33.030 
you'll go across to spain and get three
balls<00:01:31.300> in<00:01:31.480> that<00:01:31.600> way<00:01:31.720> sometimes<00:01:32.410> to<00:01:32.830> russia

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:33.040 
balls in that way sometimes to russia

00:01:33.040 --> 00:01:35.550 
balls in that way sometimes to russia
and<00:01:33.310> you<00:01:33.370> get<00:01:33.520> three<00:01:33.760> balls<00:01:33.970> in<00:01:34.150> that<00:01:34.300> way<00:01:34.560> from

00:01:35.550 --> 00:01:35.560 
and you get three balls in that way from

00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:37.080 
and you get three balls in that way from
memory<00:01:36.010> i<00:01:36.040> don't<00:01:36.280> think<00:01:36.490> you<00:01:36.580> ever<00:01:36.700> play<00:01:36.910> all

00:01:37.080 --> 00:01:37.090 
memory i don't think you ever play all

00:01:37.090 --> 00:01:39.390 
memory i don't think you ever play all
four<00:01:37.390> unless<00:01:37.660> you<00:01:37.810> play<00:01:38.020> the<00:01:38.170> campaign<00:01:38.350> go<00:01:38.890> in

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:39.400 
four unless you play the campaign go in

00:01:39.400 --> 00:01:41.700 
four unless you play the campaign go in
this<00:01:39.640> game<00:01:39.910> the<00:01:40.120> french<00:01:40.390> win<00:01:40.750> if<00:01:41.050> they<00:01:41.320> can<00:01:41.530> get

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:41.710 
this game the french win if they can get

00:01:41.710 --> 00:01:45.750 
this game the french win if they can get
an<00:01:41.830> under<00:01:42.280> siege<00:01:42.520> units<00:01:43.120> in<00:01:43.360> vienna<00:01:44.520> okay<00:01:45.520> and

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:45.760 
an under siege units in vienna okay and

00:01:45.760 --> 00:01:48.480 
an under siege units in vienna okay and
there<00:01:46.390> the<00:01:46.720> opposition<00:01:47.020> is<00:01:47.560> the<00:01:47.950> Austrians

00:01:48.480 --> 00:01:48.490 
there the opposition is the Austrians

00:01:48.490 --> 00:01:52.160 
there the opposition is the Austrians
and<00:01:48.760> the<00:01:48.970> Russians<00:01:49.420> in<00:01:50.040> genitive<00:01:51.040> free<00:01:51.310> plans

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:52.170 
and the Russians in genitive free plans

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:58.070 
and the Russians in genitive free plans
1806<00:01:53.170> to<00:01:53.670> 1807<00:01:54.670> the<00:01:54.910> French<00:01:55.840> are<00:01:56.740> up<00:01:56.920> against

00:01:58.070 --> 00:01:58.080 
1806 to 1807 the French are up against

00:01:58.080 --> 00:02:02.540 
1806 to 1807 the French are up against
Prussians<00:01:59.610> Russians<00:02:00.610> and<00:02:00.910> Austrians

00:02:02.540 --> 00:02:02.550 
Prussians Russians and Austrians

00:02:02.550 --> 00:02:05.010 
Prussians Russians and Austrians
potentially<00:02:03.550> I<00:02:03.790> think<00:02:04.330> one<00:02:04.480> of<00:02:04.510> them<00:02:04.660> comes<00:02:04.870> in

00:02:05.010 --> 00:02:05.020 
potentially I think one of them comes in

00:02:05.020 --> 00:02:08.040 
potentially I think one of them comes in
as<00:02:05.140> a<00:02:05.460> possible<00:02:06.460> reinforcements<00:02:07.360> anyway<00:02:07.870> the

00:02:08.040 --> 00:02:08.050 
as a possible reinforcements anyway the

00:02:08.050 --> 00:02:10.499 
as a possible reinforcements anyway the
the<00:02:08.080> Allies<00:02:08.709> if<00:02:08.950> you<00:02:09.069> like<00:02:09.250> they<00:02:09.910> have<00:02:10.179> to<00:02:10.330> have

00:02:10.499 --> 00:02:10.509 
the Allies if you like they have to have

00:02:10.509 --> 00:02:12.420 
the Allies if you like they have to have
at<00:02:10.780> the<00:02:10.960> end<00:02:11.110> of<00:02:11.320> the<00:02:11.410> scenario<00:02:11.950> so<00:02:12.130> this<00:02:12.250> one

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:12.430 
at the end of the scenario so this one

an unbeaten it are thinking that make

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:22.530 
an unbeaten it are thinking that make

Hannover so that's the it's a kind of

00:02:26.959 --> 00:02:29.350 
Hannover so that's the it's a kind of
non<00:02:27.230> French<00:02:27.709> player<00:02:28.069> winning<00:02:28.790> conditions

that time in where kram 1809

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:34.750 
that time in where kram 1809
it's<00:02:33.200> the<00:02:33.409> French<00:02:33.650> player<00:02:34.010> who<00:02:34.340> has<00:02:34.519> to

end<00:02:42.890> of<00:02:43.040> the<00:02:43.099> game<00:02:43.310> so<00:02:43.609> it's<00:02:43.670> another<00:02:44.000> one

00:02:44.140 --> 00:02:44.150 
end of the game so it's another one

again that goes through to the end of

00:02:47.060 --> 00:02:50.289 
again that goes through to the end of
