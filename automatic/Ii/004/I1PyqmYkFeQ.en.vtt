00:00:00.860 --> 00:00:06.150
 Hello, let them tell you today 

00:00:03.330 --> 00:00:09.389
 about such a problem that last me 

00:00:06.150 --> 00:00:12.660
 time I have not come across the third time 

00:00:09.389 --> 00:00:14.280
 on fed it was on the series yet 

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:17.640
 some laptop I do not remember that is 

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:20.510
 the problem is that the laptop supports 

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:23.189
 only uefi download 

00:00:20.510 --> 00:00:25.800
 let's specifically fed 

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:27.779
 I will show that is included in 2 

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:30.570
 I thought to boot into bios I will hear 

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:32.759
 already installed here my bios and when we 

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:36.030
 go to the but tab here 

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:38.370
 only she has a file mode tass legacy mode 

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:42.270
 here no we cannot switch to 

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:46.020
 Legacy mode Well, how much I looked 

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:48.450
 looked i think so the problem is 

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:52.949
 that here bellus is sewn up without support 

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:54.840
 specifically on the lake 6550 seems model 

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:57.600
 I went to the manufacturerâ€™s website and 

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:59.670
 found that place of virus options 

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:01.649
 that is, the BIOS option and Wi-Fi only 

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:09.270
 BIOS option where you can choose 

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:11.760
 where do we download from here 

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:12.240
 boot menu flash drive I have is but boot 

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:14.909
 menu 

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:17.580
 from the fourth position must determine 

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:20.610
 When you turn on the flash drive, it flashes 

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:22.650
 there is food coming in but at this point 

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:24.330
 There is no name for my flash drive, that is, a flash drive 

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:26.700
 even if here put on first 

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:30.270
 position once it still does not load 

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:33.450
 in this case will help 

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:36.630
 two options only BIOS firmware or 

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:39.060
 BIOS firmware or make a USB flash drive 

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:41.549
 which support download Wi fi 

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:45.290
 mode below the video will link as 

00:01:41.549 --> 00:01:48.780
 make this flash bios firmware 

00:01:45.290 --> 00:01:51.119
 let's say if we take the gray version to 

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:52.710
 it was put windows beat sewn from under 

00:01:51.119 --> 00:01:55.799
 windows and that is, until you put 

00:01:52.710 --> 00:02:00.259
 windows you will not live the firmware which 

00:01:55.799 --> 00:02:02.670
 supports booting from legacy 

00:02:00.259 --> 00:02:04.500
 it turns out until you read bios you with 

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:07.259
 The usual flash drive does not put a solution to this 

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:09.739
 problems here is to make a flash drive which 

00:02:07.259 --> 00:02:14.640
 supports booting through 

00:02:09.739 --> 00:02:15.120
 uefa mode all here we found uefa different 

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:18.510
 flash drive 

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:23.209
 did not find brought on my taken 

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:29.239
 we turn on the laptop 

00:02:23.209 --> 00:02:31.980
 go in two go to the tab but i 

00:02:29.239 --> 00:02:35.099
 right here we see that our flash drive 

00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:41.010
 decided all she decided and 

00:02:35.099 --> 00:02:46.319
 loading from it will go oxide inter and 

00:02:41.010 --> 00:02:50.630
 see if the download goes and this 

00:02:46.319 --> 00:02:55.950
 flash drive with eight on seven 

00:02:50.630 --> 00:02:59.280
 Sevens now there is no flash drive here us 

00:02:55.950 --> 00:03:00.120
 flash drive flashes something happens mean 

00:02:59.280 --> 00:03:04.940
 loading went 

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:04.940
 let's wait for the screen to appear 

00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:13.720
 yes all loading went the seven too 

00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:17.320
 It should go to download but not the fact it is necessary to 

00:03:13.720 --> 00:03:18.430
 check everything if someone knows others 

00:03:17.320 --> 00:03:21.010
 problem solving 

00:03:18.430 --> 00:03:23.890
 specifically this is either common which i 

00:03:21.010 --> 00:03:26.140
 described write in the comments discuss 

00:03:23.890 --> 00:03:28.180
 if something sensible, I'll add it later 

00:03:26.140 --> 00:03:30.220
 video all if the video turned out to you 

00:03:28.180 --> 00:03:33.270
 useful like signed channel 

00:03:30.220 --> 00:03:33.270
 good luck to you all
