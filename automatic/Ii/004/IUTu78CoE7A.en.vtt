first thought was that something was

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:48.260 
first thought was that something was
wrong<00:00:45.780> like<00:00:46.200> maybe<00:00:46.950> the<00:00:47.100> game<00:00:47.309> was<00:00:47.520> damaged<00:00:47.940> or

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:48.270 
wrong like maybe the game was damaged or

00:01:59.039 --> 00:01:59.049 

00:01:59.049 --> 00:02:00.999 

obviously<00:02:00.049> there's<00:02:00.259> not<00:02:00.379> much<00:02:00.619> to<00:02:00.799> talk<00:02:00.950> about

00:02:00.999 --> 00:02:01.009

00:02:05.109 --> 00:02:05.119 
guess there's some leveling up which is

00:02:05.119 --> 00:02:07.959 
guess there's some leveling up which is
nice<00:02:05.329> but<00:02:06.049> it<00:02:06.619> happens<00:02:06.979> automatically<00:02:07.609> you

00:02:07.959 --> 00:02:07.969 
nice but it happens automatically you

00:02:07.969 --> 00:02:09.940 
nice but it happens automatically you
know<00:02:08.179> you<00:02:08.599> don't<00:02:08.720> pick<00:02:09.049> which<00:02:09.319> attacks<00:02:09.709> are

00:02:09.940 --> 00:02:09.950 
know you don't pick which attacks are

00:02:09.950 --> 00:02:12.190 
know you don't pick which attacks are
improved<00:02:10.340> the<00:02:11.120> boss<00:02:11.329> battles<00:02:11.750> are<00:02:11.870> kind<00:02:12.049> of<00:02:12.109> a

00:02:12.190 --> 00:02:12.200 
improved the boss battles are kind of a

00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:14.740 
improved the boss battles are kind of a
joke<00:02:12.440> you<00:02:12.650> just<00:02:12.859> mash<00:02:13.400> the<00:02:13.430> fireballs<00:02:14.180> until

00:02:14.740 --> 00:02:14.750
