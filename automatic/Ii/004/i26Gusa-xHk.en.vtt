00:00:00.019 --> 00:00:01.920
 adjust your television 

00:00:01.920 --> 00:00:04.920
 what they are seeing now in theory has to be hard to see 

00:00:05.610 --> 00:00:09.430
 In this way, our job is to explore the objects 

00:00:09.430 --> 00:00:13.610
 everyday people around us and find out how they are made but let's start by leaving 

00:00:13.610 --> 00:00:14.919
 something very clear 

00:00:14.919 --> 00:00:18.189
 the manufacture of glass is anything - simple 

00:00:19.589 --> 00:00:21.070
 percent 

00:00:21.070 --> 00:00:22.749
 your name 

00:00:22.749 --> 00:00:25.749
 we'll see 

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:29.550
 the use of glass is known since the times of the Egyptians 

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:31.840
 four thousand years ago 

00:00:31.840 --> 00:00:35.910
 but it was not used in construction if not just to protect small objects 

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:38.109
 later 

00:00:38.109 --> 00:00:39.050
 the Romans 

00:00:39.050 --> 00:00:42.989
 would be the masters in glass making and their methods would be used 

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:44.650
 until the 18th century 

00:00:44.650 --> 00:00:48.880
 but at the end of the 19th century, glass ceased to be a luxury object for 

00:00:48.880 --> 00:00:52.630
 become a building material as common as steel and 

00:00:52.630 --> 00:00:55.480
 the concrete 

00:00:55.480 --> 00:00:58.480
 during his youth 

00:01:03.190 --> 00:01:07.970
 the glass is made from several raw materials mixed with water these 

00:01:07.970 --> 00:01:09.230
 matters are 

00:01:09.230 --> 00:01:11.020
 arenas and lithic 

00:01:11.020 --> 00:01:13.130
 sodium carbonate 

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:15.210
 dolomite 

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:17.360
 limestone 

00:01:17.360 --> 00:01:19.530
 nef the inaes and issue 

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:22.530
 and sodium sulfate 

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:30.030
 The process begins by pouring fragments of recycled glass into a hopper with 

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:32.880
 new raw material 

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:34.440
 all this will melt 

00:01:34.440 --> 00:01:38.810
 the mixture of materials leaves a continuous flow to a gas oven 

00:01:43.420 --> 00:01:47.350
 the temperature inside the oven is one thousand 500 degrees centigrade 

00:01:47.350 --> 00:01:50.380
 It has capacity for one thousand five hundred tons of molten glass 

00:01:50.930 --> 00:01:54.170
 500 tons are used every day 

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:57.870
 in this regeneration chamber they lend themselves to the idea of â€‹â€‹combustion 

00:01:57.869 --> 00:02:00.869
 amin thrown 

00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:06.550
 the materials of the mixture begin to melt and the glass must be removed 

00:02:06.550 --> 00:02:07.680
 molten 

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:12.740
 the homogenizer mixes the glass to equalize the temperature in a few hours 

00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:15.740
 will make the spill 

00:02:17.339 --> 00:02:21.719
 in the glass industry this machine is known as top roller 

00:02:21.719 --> 00:02:25.489
 the glass is poured a liquid tin bath in which floats 

00:02:25.489 --> 00:02:29.559
 now it is a soft material that is molded forming a farm 

00:02:29.559 --> 00:02:33.239
 All tin bath equipment is cooled with water so it does not break 

00:02:33.239 --> 00:02:36.239
 with the heat 

00:02:37.199 --> 00:02:42.069
 when it comes out of the bathroom the video is at 600 degrees you have to cool it once 

00:02:42.069 --> 00:02:45.069
 more and it takes care of this machine 

00:02:48.899 --> 00:02:52.649
 This huge glass ribbon measures 3 to 3 meters wide 

00:03:03.329 --> 00:03:07.249
 the glass ribbon goes softly into the rollers and goes cold 

00:03:07.249 --> 00:03:10.249
 gradually 

00:03:12.309 --> 00:03:14.699
 the glass is still talking 

00:03:14.699 --> 00:03:18.259
 the marks that we see are the traces left by the top roller 

00:03:20.889 --> 00:03:25.519
 The glass should have a uniform thickness and this laser scanner measures it with a 

00:03:25.519 --> 00:03:28.519
 precision of hundredths of a millimeter 

00:03:29.039 --> 00:03:30.909
 the video is already very hard 

00:03:30.909 --> 00:03:33.309
 the next step is to cut it 

00:03:33.309 --> 00:03:37.629
 this ultra-hard golf carbide roller thus branched a longitudinal notch 

00:03:37.629 --> 00:03:40.629
 before the cut 

00:03:41.439 --> 00:03:44.599
 then the transversal notches are made according to the dimensions 

00:03:44.599 --> 00:03:49.819
 ordered by customers pre-cut glass separates easily 

00:03:56.049 --> 00:03:59.609
 the glass strips are separated and he continued his journey through the ribbon 

00:03:59.609 --> 00:04:02.609
 conveyor 

00:04:10.589 --> 00:04:13.609
 This roller will cut the edges of the glass ribbon 

00:04:18.099 --> 00:04:21.209
 the leftover glass fall into a container 

00:04:21.209 --> 00:04:24.209
 subsequently it will be recycled 

00:04:27.889 --> 00:04:31.569
 this rubber-lined rollers guide the glass sheets towards the 

00:04:31.569 --> 00:04:34.569
 inspection department 

00:04:35.270 --> 00:04:39.690
 when they arrive for inspection these immense sheets of glass are manipulated 

00:04:39.690 --> 00:04:42.690
 carefully and placed vertically 

00:04:53.699 --> 00:04:57.590
 the glass is inspected with fluorescent lamps in search of defects 

00:05:00.360 --> 00:05:05.240
 once inspected the sheets are moved one by one and stored in 

00:05:05.240 --> 00:05:08.240
 vertical 

00:05:12.120 --> 00:05:16.100
 for the manufacture of glass it takes several days now it is already 

00:05:16.100 --> 00:05:18.699
 ready for delivery 

00:05:18.699 --> 00:05:22.909
 the heat has transformed solid ingredients into transparent glass
