00:00:16.510 --> 00:00:20.339
 well, well 

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:23.730
 all these series and so we end up 

00:00:20.339 --> 00:00:25.769
 for a first to nothing commented does a 

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:27.599
 test what I do not know if they had 

00:00:25.769 --> 00:00:30.390
 given a lot since I'm thinking 

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:31.980
 a lot of times he can 

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:33.239
 maybe have blanks we will test 

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:34.940
 a way to see that you are 

00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:37.680
 a lot to have asked me 

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:42.239
 so here I am finally I finish my turn 

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:46.320
 he wants to present the zobal so overall 

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:48.720
 of vampires usual guitar and sea urchins 

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:51.199
 we all know little bouquets 

00:00:48.720 --> 00:00:52.679
 of hasparren and by five years 

00:00:51.199 --> 00:00:55.769
 fifty percent 

00:00:52.679 --> 00:01:03.260
 it hurt me that on the small dockal 

00:00:55.769 --> 00:01:03.260
 plastron start all the same 2 3 4 5 

00:01:04.309 --> 00:01:07.860
 1 does not start well original so a 

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:12.210
 bomb 

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:14.310
 I like to say same men so the dopeul 

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:16.670
 who can be nor can we put him 

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:19.920
 pv a lot a lot of rounds in a row 

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:22.200
 so that's very hard to play the open 

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:32.869
 oval are central to erosion or are 

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:38.240
 Too much rocks to stay at the ball rech ouah 

00:01:32.869 --> 00:01:43.380
 intact the make me my hero of the cables 

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:46.250
 have two three four to the point of others 

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:46.250
 in Europe 

00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:52.070
 look at my pay or before 11 11 10 9 8 7 

00:01:55.219 --> 00:01:59.909
 very complicit not that he can 

00:01:57.810 --> 00:02:03.090
 put in but at the same time he can 

00:01:59.909 --> 00:02:09.030
 come my skin will be embarrassed I run I 

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:11.459
 will stay there 53 sp a is still a 

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:16.049
 before him had lost 1 wayne to each 

00:02:11.459 --> 00:02:17.130
 times it's already this peace m and 110 countries 

00:02:16.049 --> 00:02:19.250
 he can still do a lot of 

00:02:17.130 --> 00:02:19.250
 things 

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:26.489
 so my body against the wall is 

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:27.720
 logical when he did redouble 

00:02:26.489 --> 00:02:28.390
 mauritius who will put points of 

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:34.000
 shields 

00:02:28.390 --> 00:02:39.370
 say France for example good I bent and 

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:55.709
 trans it thinks thinks about and 

00:02:39.370 --> 00:02:58.540
 frags downright six racing games 2 1 

00:02:55.709 --> 00:03:02.470
 I have to get there so nine eight 

00:02:58.540 --> 00:03:11.860
 seven six five four three two one zero 

00:03:02.470 --> 00:03:12.250
 I will be able to push the Dopel we will 

00:03:11.860 --> 00:03:16.150
 backwards 

00:03:12.250 --> 00:03:18.220
 good it does not change much more I 

00:03:16.150 --> 00:03:23.550
 pushed up there and there I see 

00:03:18.220 --> 00:03:27.300
 come back to shoot he's always there run into 

00:03:23.550 --> 00:03:27.300
 so it starts 

00:03:27.630 --> 00:03:37.140
 it was a fight I think 5005 at 

00:03:30.010 --> 00:03:42.190
 early 4005 pretty much so 

00:03:37.140 --> 00:03:43.630
 it's played well against I zapped 

00:03:42.190 --> 00:03:47.340
 to the islands can not push too much so 

00:03:43.630 --> 00:03:47.340
 that I can always see her 

00:03:57.720 --> 00:04:02.040
 it is still eroded 

00:04:03.910 --> 00:04:08.390
 so that's where you have to enjoy it 

00:04:06.560 --> 00:04:10.010
 go anyway to Kabul this round did 

00:04:08.390 --> 00:04:12.500
 is still well exposed I'm not 

00:04:10.010 --> 00:04:16.250
 against a wall they can easily 

00:04:12.500 --> 00:04:24.169
 put in so the father apprentice 

00:04:16.250 --> 00:04:26.180
 erosion this turn and at 4003 already that is 

00:04:24.169 --> 00:04:29.240
 what will make us already his plastron 

00:04:26.180 --> 00:04:33.410
 what makes us there nice click 

00:04:29.240 --> 00:04:36.260
 he put this click I think then there so 

00:04:33.410 --> 00:04:47.360
 I climbed if it's 2 p at a cellar 

00:04:36.260 --> 00:04:56.360
 other 6 of peace at 3,4 to 8 9 that's 

00:04:47.360 --> 00:04:58.250
 good it goes to donkeys in opel game in 

00:04:56.360 --> 00:05:00.710
 plus what removes from the aa no no I do not 

00:04:58.250 --> 00:05:02.150
 I'm not worried about the dopeul but I 

00:05:00.710 --> 00:05:06.200
 am attacked by the zobal and I can not 

00:05:02.150 --> 00:05:08.830
 move to the top-ten's place that by 

00:05:06.200 --> 00:05:19.310
 against it is disturbing 

00:05:08.830 --> 00:05:22.789
 so we will change plan was 

00:05:19.310 --> 00:05:25.750
 this opel that annoys us well 1 2 3 

00:05:22.789 --> 00:05:25.750
 4 5 

00:05:27.370 --> 00:05:33.680
 so here we cross a good shield 

00:05:29.450 --> 00:05:38.479
 always eroding 3008 it goes down 

00:05:33.680 --> 00:05:41.410
 little by little 3007 it will have seems 

00:05:38.479 --> 00:05:44.539
 place three next games over very safe 

00:05:41.410 --> 00:05:49.099
 it's closed bullish men the three 

00:05:44.539 --> 00:06:01.360
 stones in polish parks 1 2 3 1 2 

00:05:49.099 --> 00:06:03.590
 3 4 5 6 7 6 8 6 and so if I hold it up 

00:06:01.360 --> 00:06:07.340
 if I ask I think I succeeded 

00:06:03.590 --> 00:06:10.000
 it's with the boat so 9 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 

00:06:07.340 --> 00:06:10.000
 1 it's good 

00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:18.800
 it just goes I can not 

00:06:16.320 --> 00:06:21.480
 realign my bomb 

00:06:18.800 --> 00:06:24.150
 so for now we will do without 

00:06:21.480 --> 00:06:25.530
 I would view and round before but 

00:06:24.150 --> 00:06:36.590
 who loses next he still has this turn 

00:06:25.530 --> 00:06:39.260
 but would have been taken already so the 

00:06:36.590 --> 00:06:42.030
 up 

00:06:39.260 --> 00:06:43.620
 what the wii still allows erosion 

00:06:42.030 --> 00:06:47.790
 so that's fine there he takes but at 

00:06:43.620 --> 00:06:51.570
 next other songs and thankfully 

00:06:47.790 --> 00:06:53.030
 he's leaving here he's gonna double me boli I 

00:06:51.570 --> 00:06:57.060
 think to try to get away 

00:06:53.030 --> 00:06:59.940
 it takes the pv of the trance no to these 

00:06:57.060 --> 00:07:03.230
 ready will not he says frac but I 

00:06:59.940 --> 00:07:03.230
 do not think that's enough said frac 

00:07:11.690 --> 00:07:25.440
 hop hop hop as a fun game 506 ah 

00:07:20.970 --> 00:07:27.420
 yeah that goes on I did not look for 

00:07:25.440 --> 00:07:28.530
 overload the self tests since I 

00:07:27.420 --> 00:07:30.990
 I had already had and very 

00:07:28.530 --> 00:07:32.550
 a long time but I had oxen one 

00:07:30.990 --> 00:07:33.840
 trance so he had regained his pdv 

00:07:32.550 --> 00:07:36.360
 before taking the damage of the 

00:07:33.840 --> 00:07:38.640
 bomb that had made that I lost 

00:07:36.360 --> 00:07:40.980
 but here it is good we will see there I hope 

00:07:38.640 --> 00:07:43.950
 that you will have liked at least 990 toll 

00:07:40.980 --> 00:07:44.430
 it's always a pleasure and so I 

00:07:43.950 --> 00:07:46.820
 see you soon 

00:07:44.430 --> 00:07:46.820
 ciao
