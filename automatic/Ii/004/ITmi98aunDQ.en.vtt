helicopters and quad copters but this is
actually<00:00:12.960> my<00:00:13.080> first<00:00:13.349> airplane<00:00:13.710> the<00:00:14.549> reason

00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:14.910 
actually my first airplane the reason

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:16.790 
actually my first airplane the reason
being<00:00:15.150> is<00:00:15.420> that<00:00:15.780> I've<00:00:15.929> never<00:00:16.230> been<00:00:16.590> good<00:00:16.740> at

00:00:16.790 --> 00:00:16.800 
being is that I've never been good at

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:18.410 
being is that I've never been good at
flying<00:00:17.100> airplanes<00:00:17.550> for<00:00:17.789> more<00:00:17.970> than<00:00:18.090> a<00:00:18.119> few

00:00:18.410 --> 00:00:18.420 
flying airplanes for more than a few

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:20.120 
flying airplanes for more than a few
times<00:00:18.480> before<00:00:18.869> crashing<00:00:19.590> and<00:00:19.710> completely

00:00:20.120 --> 00:00:20.130 
times before crashing and completely

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:22.580 
times before crashing and completely
destroying<00:00:20.609> them<00:00:20.850> but<00:00:21.330> I've<00:00:21.779> mastered<00:00:22.410> this

00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:22.590 
destroying them but I've mastered this

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:24.740 
destroying them but I've mastered this
one<00:00:22.830> in<00:00:23.010> the<00:00:23.130> first<00:00:23.460> flight<00:00:23.760> I've<00:00:24.269> crashed<00:00:24.570> it

00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:24.750 
one in the first flight I've crashed it

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:26.540 
one in the first flight I've crashed it
pretty<00:00:25.199> hard<00:00:25.439> in<00:00:25.560> the<00:00:25.650> grass<00:00:25.859> and<00:00:26.220> a<00:00:26.340> couple

light crashes on the street and it's

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:30.290 
light crashes on the street and it's
held<00:00:28.439> up<00:00:28.590> pretty<00:00:28.740> good<00:00:29.099> now<00:00:29.400> no<00:00:29.609> airplane<00:00:30.150> is

00:00:30.290 --> 00:00:30.300 
held up pretty good now no airplane is

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:32.120 
held up pretty good now no airplane is
going<00:00:30.449> to<00:00:30.510> be<00:00:30.599> indestructible<00:00:31.140> but<00:00:31.830> if<00:00:31.980> you're

00:00:32.120 --> 00:00:32.130 
going to be indestructible but if you're

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:33.889 
going to be indestructible but if you're
learning<00:00:32.250> to<00:00:32.520> fly<00:00:32.700> this<00:00:33.239> one's<00:00:33.480> going<00:00:33.690> to<00:00:33.719> give

00:00:33.889 --> 00:00:33.899 
learning to fly this one's going to give

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:35.540 
learning to fly this one's going to give
you<00:00:33.989> the<00:00:34.110> best<00:00:34.290> chance<00:00:34.469> just<00:00:34.920> because<00:00:35.160> it's<00:00:35.309> so

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:35.550 
you the best chance just because it's so

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:37.190 
you the best chance just because it's so
rugged<00:00:35.880> and<00:00:36.120> it<00:00:36.360> can<00:00:36.510> take<00:00:36.630> a<00:00:36.690> lot<00:00:36.930> of<00:00:36.989> abuse

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:37.200 
rugged and it can take a lot of abuse

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:39.290 
rugged and it can take a lot of abuse
and<00:00:37.770> that's<00:00:38.010> why<00:00:38.160> I'm<00:00:38.309> so<00:00:38.610> excited<00:00:38.760> to<00:00:39.270> finally

00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:39.300

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:42.380 
and that's why I'm so excited to finally
recommend<00:00:40.230> a<00:00:40.290> plane<00:00:40.530> that<00:00:41.070> is<00:00:41.219> fun<00:00:41.520> easy<00:00:42.120> to

fly<00:00:42.570> and<00:00:42.899> doesn't<00:00:43.500> break<00:00:43.649> every<00:00:43.950> time<00:00:44.129> you

00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:44.250 
fly and doesn't break every time you

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:45.860 
fly and doesn't break every time you
crash<00:00:44.489> I'm<00:00:44.940> going<00:00:45.210> to<00:00:45.300> go<00:00:45.390> over<00:00:45.420> some

this is how do you control this thing in

00:00:57.030 --> 00:00:59.599 
this is how do you control this thing in
flight<00:00:57.449> is<00:00:57.960> this<00:00:58.140> just<00:00:58.410> a<00:00:58.500> basic<00:00:58.920> glider<00:00:59.250> or

00:00:59.599 --> 00:00:59.609 
flight is this just a basic glider or

are you gonna have a lot of control when

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:03.200 
are you gonna have a lot of control when
flying<00:01:01.590> it<00:01:01.739> around<00:01:01.949> well<00:01:02.550> I<00:01:02.699> didn't<00:01:03.000> have<00:01:03.090> very

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:03.210 
flying it around well I didn't have very

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:05.210 
flying it around well I didn't have very
high<00:01:03.539> expectations<00:01:04.320> for<00:01:04.500> around<00:01:04.710> 50<00:01:05.010> bucks

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:05.220 
high expectations for around 50 bucks

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:08.539 
high expectations for around 50 bucks
but<00:01:05.460> I<00:01:06.119> was<00:01:06.360> really<00:01:06.869> surprised<00:01:07.320> on<00:01:07.979> how<00:01:08.010> much

00:01:08.539 --> 00:01:08.549 
but I was really surprised on how much

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:10.640 
but I was really surprised on how much
control<00:01:09.060> you<00:01:09.090> actually<00:01:09.780> have<00:01:10.049> and<00:01:10.260> as<00:01:10.350> you'll

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:10.650 
control you actually have and as you'll

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:12.859 
control you actually have and as you'll
see<00:01:10.799> from<00:01:10.830> the<00:01:11.010> video<00:01:11.310> this<00:01:11.939> thing<00:01:12.240> can<00:01:12.720> do<00:01:12.840> a

00:01:12.859 --> 00:01:12.869 
see from the video this thing can do a

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:15.950 
see from the video this thing can do a
lot<00:01:13.170> and<00:01:13.530> it<00:01:14.369> can<00:01:14.400> do<00:01:14.640> a<00:01:14.670> lot<00:01:14.939> with<00:01:15.450> just<00:01:15.479> these

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:15.960 
lot and it can do a lot with just these

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:18.800 
lot and it can do a lot with just these
two<00:01:16.020> motors<00:01:16.909> now<00:01:17.909> the<00:01:18.000> controls<00:01:18.509> on<00:01:18.780> the

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:18.810 
two motors now the controls on the

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:20.929 
two motors now the controls on the
controller<00:01:19.290> are<00:01:19.740> very<00:01:19.920> basic<00:01:20.369> you<00:01:20.549> have<00:01:20.700> your

00:01:20.929 --> 00:01:20.939 
controller are very basic you have your

00:01:20.939 --> 00:01:23.240 
controller are very basic you have your
throttle<00:01:21.869> and<00:01:22.170> it<00:01:22.439> is<00:01:22.590> digitally

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:23.250 
throttle and it is digitally

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:25.789 
throttle and it is digitally
proportioned<00:01:23.939> so<00:01:24.180> you<00:01:24.840> go<00:01:24.960> full<00:01:25.200> throttle<00:01:25.229> all

00:01:25.789 --> 00:01:25.799 
proportioned so you go full throttle all

00:01:25.799 --> 00:01:28.190 
proportioned so you go full throttle all
the<00:01:26.100> way<00:01:26.430> down<00:01:26.729> to<00:01:26.970> no<00:01:27.119> speed<00:01:27.420> and<00:01:27.659> everywhere

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:28.200 
the way down to no speed and everywhere

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:30.530 
the way down to no speed and everywhere
in<00:01:28.320> between<00:01:28.350> you're<00:01:28.890> gonna<00:01:29.040> get<00:01:29.369> a<00:01:29.610> very<00:01:30.240> nice

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:30.540 
in between you're gonna get a very nice

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:34.039 
in between you're gonna get a very nice
smooth<00:01:31.020> increase<00:01:31.560> in<00:01:31.740> power<00:01:32.750> turning<00:01:33.750> is<00:01:33.869> very

00:01:34.039 --> 00:01:34.049 
smooth increase in power turning is very

00:01:34.049 --> 00:01:35.120 
smooth increase in power turning is very
basic<00:01:34.259> you<00:01:34.500> just<00:01:34.530> have<00:01:34.710> to<00:01:34.770> you<00:01:34.829> love<00:01:34.979> to<00:01:35.070> me

00:01:38.510 --> 00:01:38.520 
right and what that's gonna do is either

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:42.050 
right and what that's gonna do is either
slow<00:01:38.939> down<00:01:38.970> or<00:01:39.180> some<00:01:40.170> heat<00:01:40.320> up<00:01:40.729> accordingly<00:01:41.729> so

00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:42.060 
slow down or some heat up accordingly so

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:44.090 
slow down or some heat up accordingly so
if<00:01:42.420> you<00:01:42.509> want<00:01:42.659> to<00:01:42.720> turn<00:01:42.869> left<00:01:42.899> your<00:01:43.799> right

00:01:55.930 --> 00:01:55.940 
you also have trim tabs here and for

00:01:55.940 --> 00:01:57.310 
you also have trim tabs here and for
your<00:01:56.000> rudder<00:01:56.210> you<00:01:56.450> have<00:01:56.630> your<00:01:56.780> elevator<00:01:57.140> and

00:01:57.310 --> 00:01:57.320 
your rudder you have your elevator and

00:01:57.320 --> 00:01:59.380 
your rudder you have your elevator and
your<00:01:57.409> rudder<00:01:57.590> so<00:01:58.250> if<00:01:58.340> you<00:01:58.490> want<00:01:58.670> to<00:01:58.729> make<00:01:59.210> some

00:01:59.380 --> 00:01:59.390 
your rudder so if you want to make some

00:01:59.390 --> 00:02:01.510 
your rudder so if you want to make some
fine<00:01:59.659> adjustments<00:01:59.840> on<00:02:00.409> those<00:02:00.560> you<00:02:00.710> can<00:02:00.920> also

00:02:01.510 --> 00:02:01.520 
fine adjustments on those you can also

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:03.340 
fine adjustments on those you can also
on<00:02:01.850> their<00:02:02.030> control<00:02:02.390> you<00:02:02.570> do<00:02:02.720> have<00:02:02.930> trim<00:02:03.140> tabs

00:02:03.340 --> 00:02:03.350 
on their control you do have trim tabs

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:05.500 
on their control you do have trim tabs
here<00:02:03.650> and<00:02:03.710> here<00:02:04.010> and<00:02:04.310> that<00:02:04.790> will<00:02:04.970> adjust<00:02:05.210> the

00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:05.510 
here and here and that will adjust the

00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:07.270 
here and here and that will adjust the
power<00:02:05.750> of<00:02:06.020> the<00:02:06.140> motors<00:02:06.470> to<00:02:06.710> keep<00:02:06.920> this<00:02:07.100> thing

00:02:07.270 --> 00:02:07.280 
power of the motors to keep this thing

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:11.020 
power of the motors to keep this thing
flying<00:02:07.750> nice<00:02:08.750> and<00:02:09.110> level<00:02:09.320> and<00:02:09.709> as<00:02:10.580> you<00:02:10.729> notice

00:02:11.020 --> 00:02:11.030 
flying nice and level and as you notice

00:02:11.030 --> 00:02:14.740 
flying nice and level and as you notice
it<00:02:11.240> has<00:02:11.270> a<00:02:11.450> really<00:02:12.230> good<00:02:12.380> sized<00:02:12.590> wing<00:02:13.600> the<00:02:14.600> wing

00:02:14.740 --> 00:02:14.750 
it has a really good sized wing the wing

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:16.540 
it has a really good sized wing the wing
has<00:02:14.990> a<00:02:15.020> pretty<00:02:15.410> aggressive<00:02:15.709> curve<00:02:16.280> to<00:02:16.520> it

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:16.550 
has a pretty aggressive curve to it

00:02:16.550 --> 00:02:19.479 
has a pretty aggressive curve to it
that's<00:02:16.790> going<00:02:16.880> to<00:02:17.060> create<00:02:17.209> a<00:02:17.360> lot<00:02:17.930> of<00:02:18.110> lift<00:02:18.489> as

00:02:19.479 --> 00:02:19.489 
that's going to create a lot of lift as

00:02:19.489 --> 00:02:21.460 
that's going to create a lot of lift as
you<00:02:19.550> can<00:02:19.850> see<00:02:20.060> there's<00:02:20.300> cutaways<00:02:20.780> in<00:02:21.140> the<00:02:21.290> wing

00:02:21.460 --> 00:02:21.470 
you can see there's cutaways in the wing

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:23.830 
you can see there's cutaways in the wing
that<00:02:22.100> helps<00:02:22.430> protect<00:02:22.610> your<00:02:22.970> blades<00:02:23.239> and

00:02:23.830 --> 00:02:23.840 
that helps protect your blades and

00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:25.900 
that helps protect your blades and
what's<00:02:24.709> really<00:02:24.980> interesting<00:02:25.160> about<00:02:25.550> this<00:02:25.700> one

00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:25.910 
what's really interesting about this one

00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:27.910 
what's really interesting about this one
is<00:02:25.940> you<00:02:26.720> have<00:02:26.840> a<00:02:26.870> curvature<00:02:27.200> here<00:02:27.650> which

00:02:27.910 --> 00:02:27.920 
is you have a curvature here which

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:29.440 
is you have a curvature here which
creates<00:02:28.220> lift<00:02:28.489> but<00:02:28.970> you<00:02:29.060> actually<00:02:29.330> have<00:02:29.420> a

00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:29.450 
creates lift but you actually have a

00:02:29.450 --> 00:02:31.060 
creates lift but you actually have a
curvature<00:02:29.780> in<00:02:29.959> the<00:02:30.110> back<00:02:30.290> which<00:02:30.590> creates<00:02:30.980> a

00:02:31.060 --> 00:02:31.070 
curvature in the back which creates a

00:02:31.070 --> 00:02:33.729 
curvature in the back which creates a
negative<00:02:31.550> lift<00:02:32.060> and<00:02:32.750> why<00:02:32.870> they<00:02:33.019> do<00:02:33.080> that<00:02:33.380> is

00:02:33.729 --> 00:02:33.739 
negative lift and why they do that is

00:02:33.739 --> 00:02:36.580 
negative lift and why they do that is
because<00:02:34.400> that<00:02:35.330> negative<00:02:35.840> lift<00:02:36.050> is<00:02:36.320> going<00:02:36.500> to

00:02:36.580 --> 00:02:36.590 
because that negative lift is going to

00:02:36.590 --> 00:02:40.720 
because that negative lift is going to
push<00:02:37.160> down<00:02:37.730> and<00:02:38.590> keep<00:02:39.590> the<00:02:39.769> airplane<00:02:39.800> going<00:02:40.400> up

00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:40.730 
push down and keep the airplane going up

00:02:40.730 --> 00:02:43.449 
push down and keep the airplane going up
if<00:02:41.269> you<00:02:41.480> have<00:02:41.660> full<00:02:41.870> power<00:02:42.050> and<00:02:42.470> then<00:02:43.220> if<00:02:43.370> you

00:02:43.449 --> 00:02:43.459 
if you have full power and then if you

00:02:43.459 --> 00:02:45.250 
if you have full power and then if you
release<00:02:43.760> the<00:02:43.970> power<00:02:44.120> you'll<00:02:44.510> notice<00:02:44.840> airplane

00:02:45.250 --> 00:02:45.260 
release the power you'll notice airplane

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:47.650 
release the power you'll notice airplane
does<00:02:45.769> pretty<00:02:46.070> much<00:02:46.160> a<00:02:46.250> nosedive<00:02:46.550> add<00:02:47.239> about

00:02:47.650 --> 00:02:47.660 
does pretty much a nosedive add about

00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:49.990 
does pretty much a nosedive add about
half<00:02:48.080> throttle<00:02:48.440> the<00:02:49.130> airplane<00:02:49.459> wants<00:02:49.700> to<00:02:49.790> fly

00:02:49.990 --> 00:02:50.000 
half throttle the airplane wants to fly

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:52.960 
half throttle the airplane wants to fly
nice<00:02:50.450> and<00:02:50.720> level<00:02:50.980> now<00:02:51.980> as<00:02:52.250> of<00:02:52.400> recording<00:02:52.880> this

00:02:52.960 --> 00:02:52.970 
nice and level now as of recording this

00:02:52.970 --> 00:02:54.670 
nice and level now as of recording this
video<00:02:53.150> I<00:02:53.360> have<00:02:53.630> crashed<00:02:54.019> too<00:02:54.230> seen<00:02:54.440> quite<00:02:54.620> a

00:02:54.670 --> 00:02:54.680 
video I have crashed too seen quite a

00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:56.740 
video I have crashed too seen quite a
few<00:02:54.769> times<00:02:55.100> and<00:02:55.790> as<00:02:55.880> you<00:02:56.000> can<00:02:56.180> see<00:02:56.360> the<00:02:56.600> nose

00:02:56.740 --> 00:02:56.750 
few times and as you can see the nose

00:02:56.750 --> 00:02:58.449 
few times and as you can see the nose
cone<00:02:56.989> still<00:02:57.380> in<00:02:57.560> pretty<00:02:57.890> good<00:02:58.010> shape<00:02:58.070> now<00:02:58.430> I

00:02:58.449 --> 00:02:58.459 
cone still in pretty good shape now I

00:02:58.459 --> 00:03:01.630 
cone still in pretty good shape now I
did<00:02:58.790> crash<00:02:59.090> it<00:02:59.420> in<00:02:59.570> the<00:02:59.810> grass<00:03:00.140> I<00:03:00.500> have<00:03:00.860> done

00:03:01.630 --> 00:03:01.640 
did crash it in the grass I have done

00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:04.120 
did crash it in the grass I have done
some<00:03:01.880> minor<00:03:02.150> crashes<00:03:02.690> on<00:03:02.840> the<00:03:02.870> asphalt<00:03:03.380> but

00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:04.130 
some minor crashes on the asphalt but

00:03:04.130 --> 00:03:05.560 
some minor crashes on the asphalt but
this<00:03:04.310> thing's<00:03:04.489> held<00:03:04.700> up<00:03:04.850> really<00:03:05.180> well<00:03:05.510> I

00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:05.570 
this thing's held up really well I

00:03:05.570 --> 00:03:08.229 
this thing's held up really well I
didn't<00:03:06.200> think<00:03:06.230> that<00:03:07.040> it<00:03:07.190> would<00:03:07.340> hold<00:03:07.579> up<00:03:07.790> in

00:03:08.229 --> 00:03:08.239 
didn't think that it would hold up in

00:03:08.239 --> 00:03:10.240 
didn't think that it would hold up in
such<00:03:08.720> good<00:03:08.870> condition<00:03:09.049> but<00:03:09.470> the<00:03:09.829> foam<00:03:10.070> is

00:03:10.240 --> 00:03:10.250 
such good condition but the foam is

00:03:10.250 --> 00:03:13.030 
such good condition but the foam is
really<00:03:10.280> sturdy<00:03:11.150> they<00:03:12.140> do<00:03:12.290> put<00:03:12.500> a<00:03:12.530> lot<00:03:12.829> of

00:03:13.030 --> 00:03:13.040 
really sturdy they do put a lot of

00:03:13.040 --> 00:03:15.400 
really sturdy they do put a lot of
decals<00:03:13.489> on<00:03:13.700> it<00:03:13.850> which<00:03:14.360> really<00:03:14.540> does<00:03:14.870> help<00:03:15.110> the

00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:15.410 
decals on it which really does help the

00:03:15.410 --> 00:03:17.920 
decals on it which really does help the
foam<00:03:15.950> stay<00:03:16.280> together<00:03:16.670> and<00:03:16.970> prevent<00:03:17.720> it<00:03:17.900> from

00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:17.930 
foam stay together and prevent it from

00:03:17.930 --> 00:03:20.890 
foam stay together and prevent it from
chipping<00:03:18.829> away<00:03:19.329> now<00:03:20.329> what's<00:03:20.480> really<00:03:20.600> great

00:03:20.890 --> 00:03:20.900 
chipping away now what's really great

00:03:20.900 --> 00:03:23.199 
chipping away now what's really great
about<00:03:20.959> this<00:03:21.260> controller<00:03:21.739> is<00:03:21.980> that<00:03:22.549> there<00:03:22.730> is<00:03:22.970> a

00:03:23.199 --> 00:03:23.209 
about this controller is that there is a

00:03:23.209 --> 00:03:25.930 
about this controller is that there is a
5<00:03:23.810> volt<00:03:24.170> plug-in<00:03:24.560> in<00:03:24.890> it<00:03:25.010> now<00:03:25.250> it<00:03:25.430> does<00:03:25.640> come

00:03:25.930 --> 00:03:25.940 
5 volt plug-in in it now it does come

00:03:25.940 --> 00:03:28.330 
5 volt plug-in in it now it does come
with<00:03:25.970> the<00:03:26.209> cable<00:03:26.570> so<00:03:27.320> all<00:03:27.530> you<00:03:27.709> do<00:03:27.860> is<00:03:27.980> you<00:03:28.130> plug

00:03:28.330 --> 00:03:28.340 
with the cable so all you do is you plug

00:03:28.340 --> 00:03:29.699 
with the cable so all you do is you plug
this<00:03:28.519> in<00:03:28.730> here

00:03:29.699 --> 00:03:29.709 
this in here

00:03:29.709 --> 00:03:31.559 
this in here
and<00:03:29.920> then<00:03:30.489> on<00:03:30.640> the<00:03:30.790> other<00:03:30.819> end<00:03:31.060> you'd<00:03:31.359> plug

00:03:31.559 --> 00:03:31.569 
and then on the other end you'd plug

00:03:31.569 --> 00:03:34.800 
and then on the other end you'd plug
this<00:03:31.750> into<00:03:31.989> like<00:03:32.200> a<00:03:32.230> USB<00:03:32.650> port<00:03:33.150> in<00:03:34.150> my<00:03:34.329> case<00:03:34.599> I

00:03:34.800 --> 00:03:34.810 
this into like a USB port in my case I

00:03:34.810 --> 00:03:37.349 
this into like a USB port in my case I
have<00:03:35.280> this<00:03:36.280> thing<00:03:36.549> which<00:03:36.700> doesn't<00:03:36.969> come<00:03:37.239> with

00:03:37.349 --> 00:03:37.359 
have this thing which doesn't come with

00:03:37.359 --> 00:03:39.929 
have this thing which doesn't come with
a<00:03:37.390> kit<00:03:37.659> but<00:03:38.260> it's<00:03:38.530> just<00:03:38.680> basically<00:03:39.069> a<00:03:39.189> USB<00:03:39.700> port

00:03:39.929 --> 00:03:39.939 
a kit but it's just basically a USB port

00:03:39.939 --> 00:03:41.610 
a kit but it's just basically a USB port
that<00:03:39.969> you<00:03:40.120> plug<00:03:40.299> it<00:03:40.420> in<00:03:40.480> the<00:03:40.510> wall<00:03:40.599> and<00:03:41.049> you

00:03:41.610 --> 00:03:41.620 
that you plug it in the wall and you

00:03:41.620 --> 00:03:44.190 
that you plug it in the wall and you
want<00:03:41.769> to<00:03:41.829> make<00:03:41.920> sure<00:03:42.269> they<00:03:43.269> pretty<00:03:43.840> much<00:03:43.959> all

00:03:44.190 --> 00:03:44.200 
want to make sure they pretty much all

00:03:44.200 --> 00:03:46.920 
want to make sure they pretty much all
of<00:03:44.230> them<00:03:44.439> will<00:03:44.620> have<00:03:44.650> the<00:03:45.189> 5v<00:03:45.549> on<00:03:46.269> them<00:03:46.780> you

00:03:46.920 --> 00:03:46.930 
of them will have the 5v on them you

00:03:46.930 --> 00:03:48.209 
of them will have the 5v on them you
just<00:03:47.049> want<00:03:47.230> to<00:03:47.260> double<00:03:47.560> check<00:03:47.590> and<00:03:47.769> make<00:03:47.950> sure

00:03:48.209 --> 00:03:48.219 
just want to double check and make sure

00:03:48.219 --> 00:03:50.670 
just want to double check and make sure
just<00:03:49.090> plug<00:03:49.299> that<00:03:49.329> in<00:03:49.659> and<00:03:50.290> then<00:03:50.469> you<00:03:50.560> can

00:03:50.670 --> 00:03:50.680 
just plug that in and then you can

00:03:50.680 --> 00:03:54.629 
just plug that in and then you can
charge<00:03:50.980> it<00:03:51.689> from<00:03:52.689> your<00:03:52.870> wall<00:03:53.219> and<00:03:54.219> that<00:03:54.340> way<00:03:54.489> it

00:03:54.629 --> 00:03:54.639 
charge it from your wall and that way it

00:03:54.639 --> 00:03:57.240 
charge it from your wall and that way it
doesn't<00:03:54.790> drain<00:03:55.060> your<00:03:55.180> batteries<00:03:55.599> or<00:03:56.560> you<00:03:57.099> can

00:03:57.240 --> 00:03:57.250 
doesn't drain your batteries or you can

00:03:57.250 --> 00:03:59.819 
doesn't drain your batteries or you can
also<00:03:57.400> just<00:03:57.579> plug<00:03:58.120> it<00:03:58.239> into<00:03:58.389> your<00:03:58.659> laptop<00:03:59.200> the

00:03:59.819 --> 00:03:59.829 
also just plug it into your laptop the

00:03:59.829 --> 00:04:02.429 
also just plug it into your laptop the
wheels<00:04:00.040> do<00:04:00.340> feel<00:04:00.639> cheap<00:04:00.969> but<00:04:01.329> they<00:04:01.720> work<00:04:01.989> the

00:04:02.429 --> 00:04:02.439 
wheels do feel cheap but they work the

00:04:02.439 --> 00:04:04.110 
wheels do feel cheap but they work the
bright<00:04:02.650> orange<00:04:02.980> color<00:04:03.040> of<00:04:03.340> the<00:04:03.430> wheels<00:04:03.639> helps

00:04:04.110 --> 00:04:04.120 
bright orange color of the wheels helps

00:04:04.120 --> 00:04:05.849 
bright orange color of the wheels helps
to<00:04:04.239> see<00:04:04.419> if<00:04:04.599> you're<00:04:04.750> flying<00:04:05.049> level<00:04:05.560> when<00:04:05.709> it's

00:04:05.849 --> 00:04:05.859 
to see if you're flying level when it's

00:04:05.859 --> 00:04:08.819 
to see if you're flying level when it's
far<00:04:06.069> away<00:04:06.280> they<00:04:07.030> are<00:04:07.269> removable<00:04:07.959> if<00:04:08.560> you'd

00:04:08.819 --> 00:04:08.829 
far away they are removable if you'd

00:04:08.829 --> 00:04:10.559 
far away they are removable if you'd
rather<00:04:08.980> not<00:04:09.099> have<00:04:09.400> them<00:04:09.549> on<00:04:09.760> I've<00:04:10.239> taken<00:04:10.450> them

00:04:10.559 --> 00:04:10.569 
rather not have them on I've taken them

00:04:10.569 --> 00:04:12.030 
rather not have them on I've taken them
off<00:04:10.720> does<00:04:11.139> slightly<00:04:11.439> increase<00:04:11.919> the

00:04:12.030 --> 00:04:12.040 
off does slightly increase the

00:04:12.040 --> 00:04:14.129 
off does slightly increase the
performance<00:04:12.609> and<00:04:12.849> I've<00:04:13.000> noticed<00:04:13.269> adding<00:04:13.870> very

00:04:14.129 --> 00:04:14.139 
performance and I've noticed adding very

00:04:14.139 --> 00:04:15.780 
performance and I've noticed adding very
small<00:04:14.439> amounts<00:04:14.769> of<00:04:14.859> weight<00:04:15.069> to<00:04:15.310> the<00:04:15.430> front

00:04:15.780 --> 00:04:15.790 
small amounts of weight to the front

00:04:15.790 --> 00:04:18.180 
small amounts of weight to the front
nose<00:04:16.150> doesn't<00:04:16.840> make<00:04:16.989> it<00:04:17.109> fly<00:04:17.320> faster<00:04:17.859> but<00:04:18.070> the

00:04:18.180 --> 00:04:18.190 
nose doesn't make it fly faster but the

00:04:18.190 --> 00:04:19.979 
nose doesn't make it fly faster but the
trade-off<00:04:18.489> is<00:04:18.639> it<00:04:19.359> does<00:04:19.570> become<00:04:19.959> more

00:04:19.979 --> 00:04:19.989 
trade-off is it does become more

00:04:19.989 --> 00:04:23.370 
trade-off is it does become more
unstable<00:04:20.579> the<00:04:21.579> faster<00:04:22.060> you<00:04:22.150> fly<00:04:22.389> the<00:04:23.110> more

00:04:23.370 --> 00:04:23.380 
unstable the faster you fly the more

00:04:23.380 --> 00:04:25.409 
unstable the faster you fly the more
unstable<00:04:23.620> the<00:04:23.949> airplane<00:04:24.250> becomes<00:04:24.550> it<00:04:25.180> will

00:04:25.409 --> 00:04:25.419 
unstable the airplane becomes it will

00:04:25.419 --> 00:04:27.540 
unstable the airplane becomes it will
take<00:04:25.660> off<00:04:25.840> from<00:04:25.990> shortgrass<00:04:26.380> the<00:04:27.070> street<00:04:27.400> or

00:04:27.540 --> 00:04:27.550 
take off from shortgrass the street or

00:04:27.550 --> 00:04:30.390 
take off from shortgrass the street or
pretty<00:04:27.970> much<00:04:28.030> any<00:04:28.419> smooth<00:04:28.780> surface<00:04:29.099> it<00:04:30.099> does

pretty much any smooth surface it does

00:04:30.400 --> 00:04:32.700 
pretty much any smooth surface it does

00:04:32.700 --> 00:04:32.710 
need about 15 to 20 feet to take off

00:04:32.710 --> 00:04:35.040 
need about 15 to 20 feet to take off
depending<00:04:33.160> on<00:04:33.250> how<00:04:33.490> smooth<00:04:33.820> the<00:04:34.000> surfaces<00:04:34.510> now

00:04:39.210 --> 00:04:39.220 
see from the video this thing does tend

00:04:39.220 --> 00:04:41.820 
see from the video this thing does tend
to<00:04:39.340> crash<00:04:39.610> two<00:04:40.120> different<00:04:40.570> ways<00:04:40.750> nose<00:04:41.409> first

00:04:41.820 --> 00:04:41.830 
to crash two different ways nose first

00:04:45.990 --> 00:04:46.000 
prevent this from happening if this is

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:47.879 
prevent this from happening if this is
your<00:04:46.150> first<00:04:46.479> time<00:04:46.720> flying<00:04:47.110> then<00:04:47.530> definitely

00:04:47.879 --> 00:04:47.889 
your first time flying then definitely

00:04:47.889 --> 00:04:50.700 
your first time flying then definitely
fly<00:04:48.610> it<00:04:48.669> over<00:04:49.060> grass<00:04:49.330> and<00:04:49.690> if<00:04:50.199> you<00:04:50.320> have<00:04:50.500> some

00:04:50.700 --> 00:04:50.710 
fly it over grass and if you have some

00:04:50.710 --> 00:04:53.189 
fly it over grass and if you have some
packaging<00:04:51.220> tape<00:04:51.400> or<00:04:51.789> some<00:04:52.090> thick<00:04:52.360> tape<00:04:52.570> put<00:04:53.169> it

00:04:53.189 --> 00:04:53.199 
packaging tape or some thick tape put it

00:04:53.199 --> 00:04:54.629 
packaging tape or some thick tape put it
on<00:04:53.349> the<00:04:53.470> nose<00:04:53.620> to<00:04:53.860> prevent<00:04:54.130> the<00:04:54.250> foam<00:04:54.460> from

00:04:54.629 --> 00:04:54.639 
on the nose to prevent the foam from

00:04:54.639 --> 00:04:56.490 
on the nose to prevent the foam from
breaking<00:04:55.000> off<00:04:55.180> just<00:04:55.750> while<00:04:55.930> learning<00:04:56.080> to<00:04:56.289> fly

00:04:56.490 --> 00:04:56.500

00:04:56.500 --> 00:04:58.200 
breaking off just while learning to fly
the<00:04:56.620> plane<00:04:56.979> then<00:04:57.280> you<00:04:57.310> can<00:04:57.550> eventually<00:04:57.820> take

00:04:58.200 --> 00:04:58.210 
the plane then you can eventually take

00:04:58.210 --> 00:05:00.330 
the plane then you can eventually take
it<00:04:58.360> off<00:04:58.479> later<00:04:58.720> and<00:04:58.990> as<00:04:59.380> with<00:04:59.620> all<00:04:59.860> airplanes

00:05:00.330 --> 00:05:00.340 
it off later and as with all airplanes

00:05:00.340 --> 00:05:02.129 
it off later and as with all airplanes
you<00:05:00.669> want<00:05:00.849> to<00:05:00.940> make<00:05:01.030> sure<00:05:01.060> you<00:05:01.330> take<00:05:01.659> off<00:05:01.870> and

00:05:02.129 --> 00:05:02.139 
you want to make sure you take off and

00:05:02.139 --> 00:05:04.200 
you want to make sure you take off and
land<00:05:02.620> into<00:05:02.919> the<00:05:03.009> wind<00:05:03.250> that<00:05:03.490> will<00:05:03.610> make<00:05:03.789> taking

00:05:04.200 --> 00:05:04.210 
land into the wind that will make taking

00:05:04.210 --> 00:05:06.180 
land into the wind that will make taking
off<00:05:04.300> and<00:05:04.509> landing<00:05:04.539> so<00:05:05.020> much<00:05:05.199> easier<00:05:05.560> taking

00:05:06.180 --> 00:05:06.190 
off and landing so much easier taking

00:05:06.190 --> 00:05:08.010 
off and landing so much easier taking
off<00:05:06.370> you'll<00:05:06.580> want<00:05:06.729> to<00:05:06.789> have<00:05:06.940> full<00:05:07.180> power<00:05:07.389> until

00:05:08.010 --> 00:05:08.020 
off you'll want to have full power until

00:05:08.020 --> 00:05:09.749 
off you'll want to have full power until
you're<00:05:08.199> high<00:05:08.440> enough<00:05:08.590> off<00:05:08.860> the<00:05:08.889> ground<00:05:09.039> then

00:05:09.749 --> 00:05:09.759 
you're high enough off the ground then

00:05:09.759 --> 00:05:11.370 
you're high enough off the ground then
you<00:05:09.789> can<00:05:10.090> pull<00:05:10.300> the<00:05:10.419> power<00:05:10.659> back<00:05:10.960> to<00:05:10.990> around

00:05:11.370 --> 00:05:11.380 
you can pull the power back to around

00:05:11.380 --> 00:05:13.980 
you can pull the power back to around
50%<00:05:11.830> and<00:05:12.370> the<00:05:12.820> plane<00:05:13.060> will<00:05:13.180> flight<00:05:13.419> nice<00:05:13.690> and

00:05:13.980 --> 00:05:13.990 
50% and the plane will flight nice and

00:05:13.990 --> 00:05:15.930 
50% and the plane will flight nice and
level<00:05:14.139> it's<00:05:14.800> important<00:05:15.280> to<00:05:15.340> know<00:05:15.460> when<00:05:15.759> you're

00:05:15.930 --> 00:05:15.940 
level it's important to know when you're

00:05:15.940 --> 00:05:17.969 
level it's important to know when you're
taking<00:05:16.150> off<00:05:16.509> to<00:05:16.870> keep<00:05:17.050> the<00:05:17.110> wings<00:05:17.440> nice<00:05:17.710> and

stalling and falling out of the sky
you<00:05:21.580> can<00:05:21.729> do<00:05:21.880> this<00:05:22.060> just<00:05:22.270> by<00:05:22.389> applying<00:05:22.570> a

00:05:22.830 --> 00:05:22.840 
you can do this just by applying a

00:05:22.840 --> 00:05:24.719 
you can do this just by applying a
little<00:05:22.870> bit<00:05:23.080> of<00:05:23.229> left<00:05:23.530> or<00:05:23.740> right<00:05:23.979> on<00:05:24.190> your

00:05:24.719 --> 00:05:24.729 
little bit of left or right on your

00:05:24.729 --> 00:05:26.430 
little bit of left or right on your
steering<00:05:25.030> when<00:05:25.599> you're<00:05:25.720> taking<00:05:26.050> off<00:05:26.139> make

00:05:26.430 --> 00:05:26.440 
steering when you're taking off make

00:05:26.440 --> 00:05:27.870 
steering when you're taking off make
sure<00:05:26.590> you<00:05:26.710> have<00:05:26.889> enough<00:05:27.130> room<00:05:27.400> in<00:05:27.550> front<00:05:27.789> of

00:05:27.870 --> 00:05:27.880 
sure you have enough room in front of

00:05:27.880 --> 00:05:29.640 
sure you have enough room in front of
the<00:05:27.970> plane<00:05:28.210> so<00:05:28.690> you<00:05:28.780> don't<00:05:28.930> have<00:05:29.080> to<00:05:29.229> make<00:05:29.380> any

00:05:29.640 --> 00:05:29.650 
the plane so you don't have to make any

00:05:45.880 --> 00:05:45.890 
slow speeds because this thing will

00:05:45.890 --> 00:05:48.730 
slow speeds because this thing will
stall<00:05:46.220> and<00:05:46.430> fall<00:05:46.520> fast<00:05:47.300> out<00:05:47.540> of<00:05:47.660> the<00:05:47.720> sky<00:05:47.930> also

when<00:05:48.890> I<00:05:48.920> was<00:05:49.100> learning<00:05:49.280> to<00:05:49.520> fly

00:05:50.020 --> 00:05:50.030 
when I was learning to fly

00:05:50.030 --> 00:05:52.480 
when I was learning to fly
I<00:05:50.060> noticed<00:05:51.050> that<00:05:51.170> low<00:05:51.380> speeds<00:05:51.740> you<00:05:52.040> really

00:05:52.480 --> 00:05:52.490 
I noticed that low speeds you really

00:05:52.490 --> 00:05:55.030 
I noticed that low speeds you really
want<00:05:52.670> to<00:05:52.760> keep<00:05:52.910> the<00:05:53.120> turns<00:05:53.420> very<00:05:54.290> shallow<00:05:54.770> you

00:05:55.030 --> 00:05:55.040 
want to keep the turns very shallow you

00:05:55.040 --> 00:05:56.470 
want to keep the turns very shallow you
don't<00:05:55.190> want<00:05:55.340> to<00:05:55.430> make<00:05:55.550> steep<00:05:55.790> turns<00:05:56.060> at<00:05:56.300> slow

00:05:56.470 --> 00:05:56.480 
don't want to make steep turns at slow

00:05:56.480 --> 00:05:58.330 
don't want to make steep turns at slow
speeds<00:05:56.750> because<00:05:56.960> this<00:05:57.110> thing<00:05:57.380> will<00:05:57.710> stall<00:05:58.130> and

00:05:58.330 --> 00:05:58.340 
speeds because this thing will stall and

00:05:58.340 --> 00:06:00.730 
speeds because this thing will stall and
do<00:05:59.150> like<00:05:59.360> a<00:05:59.390> death<00:05:59.690> spiral<00:05:59.900> out<00:06:00.320> of<00:06:00.350> the<00:06:00.530> sky

00:06:00.730 --> 00:06:00.740 
do like a death spiral out of the sky

00:06:00.740 --> 00:06:02.830 
do like a death spiral out of the sky
when<00:06:01.670> you're<00:06:01.790> low<00:06:01.940> to<00:06:02.000> the<00:06:02.120> ground<00:06:02.180> make<00:06:02.660> sure

00:06:02.830 --> 00:06:02.840 
when you're low to the ground make sure

00:06:02.840 --> 00:06:04.840 
when you're low to the ground make sure
you<00:06:02.930> keep<00:06:03.140> your<00:06:03.320> turns<00:06:03.560> nice<00:06:03.890> and<00:06:04.130> shallow<00:06:04.310> now

00:06:04.840 --> 00:06:04.850 
you keep your turns nice and shallow now

00:06:04.850 --> 00:06:06.340 
you keep your turns nice and shallow now
you<00:06:04.940> need<00:06:05.090> time<00:06:05.210> you<00:06:05.360> have<00:06:05.540> two<00:06:05.780> motors<00:06:06.170> like

00:06:06.340 --> 00:06:06.350 
you need time you have two motors like

00:06:06.350 --> 00:06:08.110 
you need time you have two motors like
this<00:06:06.560> one<00:06:06.770> one<00:06:07.400> is<00:06:07.520> always<00:06:07.760> going<00:06:07.970> to<00:06:08.030> be

00:06:08.110 --> 00:06:08.120 
this one one is always going to be

00:06:08.120 --> 00:06:09.760 
this one one is always going to be
slightly<00:06:08.360> more<00:06:08.780> powerful<00:06:09.080> than<00:06:09.410> the<00:06:09.590> other

00:06:09.760 --> 00:06:09.770 
slightly more powerful than the other

00:06:09.770 --> 00:06:11.560 
slightly more powerful than the other
the<00:06:10.250> great<00:06:10.460> thing<00:06:10.640> about<00:06:10.670> the<00:06:10.910> controller<00:06:11.330> is

00:06:11.560 --> 00:06:11.570 
the great thing about the controller is

00:06:11.570 --> 00:06:13.240 
the great thing about the controller is
that<00:06:11.780> it<00:06:11.900> does<00:06:12.050> have<00:06:12.260> trim<00:06:12.560> tabs<00:06:12.830> and<00:06:13.010> let<00:06:13.130> you

00:06:13.240 --> 00:06:13.250 
that it does have trim tabs and let you

00:06:13.250 --> 00:06:15.400 
that it does have trim tabs and let you
adjust<00:06:13.370> the<00:06:13.700> power<00:06:13.910> of<00:06:14.150> each<00:06:14.390> motor<00:06:14.720> to<00:06:15.380> keep

00:06:15.400 --> 00:06:15.410 
adjust the power of each motor to keep

00:06:15.410 --> 00:06:17.950 
adjust the power of each motor to keep
you<00:06:15.710> flying<00:06:15.980> straight<00:06:16.430> to<00:06:17.060> perform<00:06:17.420> rolls<00:06:17.720> and

00:06:17.950 --> 00:06:17.960 
you flying straight to perform rolls and

00:06:17.960 --> 00:06:19.810 
you flying straight to perform rolls and
flips<00:06:18.260> you'll<00:06:18.740> want<00:06:18.950> to<00:06:19.040> get<00:06:19.160> high<00:06:19.370> enough<00:06:19.610> and

00:06:19.810 --> 00:06:19.820 
flips you'll want to get high enough and

00:06:19.820 --> 00:06:22.150 
flips you'll want to get high enough and
then<00:06:20.030> cut<00:06:20.330> the<00:06:20.480> power<00:06:20.660> back<00:06:21.110> and<00:06:21.350> then<00:06:21.980> either

00:06:22.150 --> 00:06:22.160 
then cut the power back and then either

00:06:22.160 --> 00:06:24.580 
then cut the power back and then either
turn<00:06:22.490> left<00:06:22.880> or<00:06:23.090> right<00:06:23.180> this<00:06:24.080> will<00:06:24.290> send<00:06:24.470> you

00:06:24.580 --> 00:06:24.590 
turn left or right this will send you

00:06:24.590 --> 00:06:27.040 
turn left or right this will send you
into<00:06:24.740> a<00:06:24.860> steep<00:06:25.220> roll<00:06:25.520> to<00:06:26.060> recover<00:06:26.419> just<00:06:26.510> let<00:06:26.900> go

00:06:27.040 --> 00:06:27.050 
into a steep roll to recover just let go

00:06:27.050 --> 00:06:28.720 
into a steep roll to recover just let go
over<00:06:27.169> the<00:06:27.260> steering<00:06:27.650> and<00:06:27.800> apply<00:06:28.310> full<00:06:28.490> power

00:06:28.720 --> 00:06:28.730 
over the steering and apply full power

00:06:28.730 --> 00:06:30.790 
over the steering and apply full power
again<00:06:28.940> to<00:06:29.660> flip<00:06:29.930> you'll<00:06:30.230> need<00:06:30.440> to<00:06:30.530> get<00:06:30.620> up
