00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:20.710 
aggressiveness of it based on this one
is<00:01:18.720> going<00:01:19.259> to<00:01:19.350> be<00:01:19.500> a<00:01:19.680> really<00:01:20.189> high-end

00:01:20.710 --> 00:01:20.720

centered die-cut base got a really good

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:26.870 
centered die-cut base got a really good
pop<00:01:25.170> it's<00:01:25.409> a<00:01:25.470> graphic<00:01:25.920> that<00:01:26.100> seems<00:01:26.640> it'll

00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:26.880 
pop it's a graphic that seems it'll

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:30.740

absorb ton of wax and it's going to get

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:33.230 
absorb ton of wax and it's going to get
faster<00:01:31.229> throughout<00:01:31.770> the<00:01:31.890> life<00:01:32.070> of<00:01:32.189> it<00:01:32.369> this

one runs the light triax glass which

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:38.600 
one runs the light triax glass which
aids<00:01:36.240> in<00:01:36.390> its<00:01:36.570> flex<00:01:36.780> pattern<00:01:37.610> definitely

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:38.610 
aids in its flex pattern definitely

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:41.060 
aids in its flex pattern definitely
reduce<00:01:38.880> the<00:01:39.060> way<00:01:39.180> of<00:01:39.270> the<00:01:39.329> board<00:01:39.600> but<00:01:40.590> makes<00:01:40.950> it

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:41.070 
reduce the way of the board but makes it

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:44.569 
reduce the way of the board but makes it
a<00:01:41.159> really<00:01:41.400> really<00:01:41.820> lively<00:01:42.890> really<00:01:43.890> responsive

is<00:01:51.149> about<00:01:51.270> a<00:01:51.329> 5<00:01:51.570> i'm<00:01:51.899> running<00:01:52.200> at<00:01:52.290> about<00:01:52.350> a<00:01:52.530> six

00:01:52.789 --> 00:01:52.799 
is about a 5 i'm running at about a six

00:01:52.799 --> 00:01:53.990 
is about a 5 i'm running at about a six
especially<00:01:53.340> when<00:01:53.430> you<00:01:53.490> compared<00:01:53.759> to<00:01:53.880> the

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:54.000 
especially when you compared to the

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:55.999 
especially when you compared to the
other<00:01:54.119> form<00:01:54.450> boards<00:01:54.810> definitely<00:01:55.530> be<00:01:55.710> one<00:01:55.860> of

00:01:55.999 --> 00:01:56.009 
other form boards definitely be one of

00:01:56.009 --> 00:01:58.580 
other form boards definitely be one of
their<00:01:56.130> more<00:01:56.310> aggressive<00:01:56.820> ones<00:01:57.590> definitely

00:01:58.580 --> 00:01:58.590 
their more aggressive ones definitely

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:00.380 
their more aggressive ones definitely
good<00:01:58.680> for<00:01:58.710> that<00:01:59.040> i<00:01:59.280> would<00:01:59.729> say<00:01:59.820> intermediate

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:00.390 
good for that i would say intermediate

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:02.780 
good for that i would say intermediate
