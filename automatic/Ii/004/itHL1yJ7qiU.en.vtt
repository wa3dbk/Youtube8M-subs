it's<00:04:41.110> a<00:04:41.200> target<00:04:41.560> effect<00:04:41.860> which<00:04:42.850> means<00:04:43.150> that<00:04:43.270> it

00:04:43.440 --> 00:04:43.450 
it's a target effect which means that it

00:04:43.450 --> 00:04:46.080 
it's a target effect which means that it
can<00:04:43.690> get<00:04:44.050> around<00:04:44.380> X<00:04:45.280> proof<00:04:45.550> and<00:04:45.730> such<00:04:45.910> i'm

blue politicizing solid removal but but
yeah<00:05:06.880> i<00:05:06.910> think<00:05:07.060> it's<00:05:07.330> i<00:05:07.540> think<00:05:07.780> it<00:05:07.990> does<00:05:08.020> have<00:05:08.200> a

00:05:08.250 --> 00:05:08.260 
yeah i think it's i think it does have a

00:05:08.260 --> 00:05:09.840 
yeah i think it's i think it does have a
shot<00:05:08.440> of<00:05:08.590> being<00:05:08.800> even<00:05:09.130> in<00:05:09.220> things<00:05:09.370> like<00:05:09.400> legacy

00:05:09.840 --> 00:05:09.850 
shot of being even in things like legacy

00:05:09.850 --> 00:05:11.420 
shot of being even in things like legacy
because<00:05:10.210> it<00:05:10.420> gets<00:05:10.540> around<00:05:10.900> things<00:05:11.260> like

00:05:11.420 --> 00:05:11.430 
because it gets around things like

00:05:11.430 --> 00:05:14.130 
because it gets around things like
hexproof<00:05:12.430> that<00:05:12.820> prevent<00:05:13.180> and<00:05:13.390> i<00:05:13.870> think<00:05:14.050> it

00:05:14.130 --> 00:05:14.140 
hexproof that prevent and i think it

00:05:14.140 --> 00:05:15.900 
hexproof that prevent and i think it
actually<00:05:14.230> can<00:05:14.500> hit<00:05:14.680> true<00:05:15.190> named<00:05:15.340> nemesis<00:05:15.730> for
