there's some box they all bring down
some<00:01:38.189> of<00:01:38.250> the<00:01:38.340> mid<00:01:38.490> specifications<00:01:39.150> as<00:01:39.240> we<00:01:39.360> go

00:01:39.469 --> 00:01:39.479 
some of the mid specifications as we go

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:43.160 
some of the mid specifications as we go
through<00:01:39.689> as<00:01:39.840> well<00:01:40.049> so<00:01:41.040> let's<00:01:41.670> a<00:01:41.909> slider<00:01:42.479> up<00:01:42.720> off

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:43.170 
through as well so let's a slider up off

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:46.310 
through as well so let's a slider up off
to<00:01:43.200> the<00:01:43.530> side<00:01:44.060> so<00:01:45.060> here<00:01:45.270> it<00:01:45.390> is<00:01:45.509> yes<00:01:45.930> the

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:46.320 
to the side so here it is yes the

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:48.499 
to the side so here it is yes the
all-new<00:01:46.770> one<00:01:47.040> again<00:01:47.850> this<00:01:47.970> is<00:01:48.119> I<00:01:48.149> think<00:01:48.329> it's

00:01:48.499 --> 00:01:48.509 
all-new one again this is I think it's

00:01:48.509 --> 00:01:50.719 
all-new one again this is I think it's
called<00:01:48.630> a<00:01:48.720> glacier<00:01:49.259> silver<00:01:49.740> and<00:01:50.070> I<00:01:50.490> won't<00:01:50.670> be

00:01:50.719 --> 00:01:50.729 
called a glacier silver and I won't be

00:01:50.729 --> 00:01:52.760 
called a glacier silver and I won't be
looking<00:01:50.850> to<00:01:51.090> pick<00:01:51.240> up<00:01:51.329> the<00:01:51.479> gunmetal<00:01:51.810> one<00:01:52.110> but

00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:52.770 
looking to pick up the gunmetal one but

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:55.819 
looking to pick up the gunmetal one but
for<00:01:52.920> now<00:01:53.040> here<00:01:53.729> is<00:01:53.970> the<00:01:54.299> silver<00:01:54.720> one<00:01:54.869> so<00:01:55.710> just

00:01:55.819 --> 00:01:55.829 
for now here is the silver one so just

00:01:55.829 --> 00:01:57.170 
for now here is the silver one so just
pop<00:01:55.950> that<00:01:56.130> off<00:01:56.219> to<00:01:56.340> the<00:01:56.399> side<00:01:56.460> real<00:01:56.880> quickly

00:01:57.170 --> 00:01:57.180 
pop that off to the side real quickly

00:01:57.180 --> 00:01:59.350 
pop that off to the side real quickly
and<00:01:57.570> we'll<00:01:57.689> see<00:01:57.840> we<00:01:57.960> also<00:01:58.140> get<00:01:58.439> inside<00:01:58.770> the<00:01:58.920> box

00:01:59.350 --> 00:01:59.360 
and we'll see we also get inside the box

00:01:59.360 --> 00:02:02.060 
and we'll see we also get inside the box
so<00:02:00.360> we<00:02:00.659> also<00:02:00.810> get<00:02:01.200> our<00:02:01.350> sim<00:02:01.740> ejector<00:02:02.040> tool

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:02.070 
so we also get our sim ejector tool

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:04.819 
so we also get our sim ejector tool
which<00:02:02.460> we'd<00:02:02.750> expect<00:02:03.750> since<00:02:03.990> we<00:02:04.229> need<00:02:04.409> it<00:02:04.619> for

00:02:04.819 --> 00:02:04.829 
which we'd expect since we need it for

00:02:04.829 --> 00:02:08.779 
which we'd expect since we need it for
the<00:02:05.040> sim<00:02:05.909> card<00:02:05.939> and<00:02:06.270> the<00:02:06.479> micro<00:02:07.140> SD<00:02:07.380> card<00:02:07.789> so

00:02:08.779 --> 00:02:08.789 
the sim card and the micro SD card so

00:02:08.789 --> 00:02:11.510 
the sim card and the micro SD card so
yes<00:02:08.970> this<00:02:09.119> does<00:02:09.270> take<00:02:09.509> a<00:02:09.539> micro<00:02:09.869> SD<00:02:10.110> card<00:02:10.520> the

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:11.520 
yes this does take a micro SD card the

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:13.950 
yes this does take a micro SD card the
micro<00:02:11.790> SD<00:02:12.060> card<00:02:12.270> is<00:02:12.690> up<00:02:12.870> to<00:02:12.959> 128<00:02:13.650> gig

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:13.960 
micro SD card is up to 128 gig

00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:01.090 
these ComStat kinda bugs which i think

00:03:01.090 --> 00:03:03.210 
these ComStat kinda bugs which i think
are<00:03:01.270> pretty<00:03:01.420> funky<00:03:01.810> and<00:03:02.530> last<00:03:02.740> but<00:03:02.860> not<00:03:02.980> least

00:03:03.210 --> 00:03:03.220 
are pretty funky and last but not least

here<00:03:05.460> the<00:03:06.460> microUSB<00:03:06.970> for<00:03:07.270> charging<00:03:07.450> is

00:03:07.800 --> 00:03:07.810 
here the microUSB for charging is

00:03:07.810 --> 00:03:10.410 
here the microUSB for charging is
syncing<00:03:08.140> it<00:03:08.230> now<00:03:08.740> this<00:03:09.010> uses<00:03:09.280> the<00:03:09.610> Qualcomm<00:03:10.120> I

00:03:10.410 --> 00:03:10.420 
syncing it now this uses the Qualcomm I

00:03:10.420 --> 00:03:11.550 
syncing it now this uses the Qualcomm I
think<00:03:10.600> it's<00:03:10.720> a<00:03:10.780> quick<00:03:10.960> charge<00:03:11.230> think<00:03:11.470> the

00:03:11.550 --> 00:03:11.560 
think it's a quick charge think the

00:03:11.560 --> 00:03:14.310 
think it's a quick charge think the
collar<00:03:11.770> the<00:03:12.460> verge<00:03:12.760> of<00:03:12.880> more<00:03:13.090> variety<00:03:13.690> now<00:03:14.260> the

00:03:14.310 --> 00:03:14.320 
collar the verge of more variety now the

00:03:14.320 --> 00:03:15.930 
collar the verge of more variety now the
our<00:03:14.590> launch<00:03:14.890> and<00:03:15.040> the<00:03:15.160> nouveau<00:03:15.430> another<00:03:15.730> one

00:03:15.930 --> 00:03:15.940 
our launch and the nouveau another one

00:03:15.940 --> 00:03:17.910 
our launch and the nouveau another one
which<00:03:16.450> uses<00:03:16.660> the<00:03:16.840> quick<00:03:17.050> charge<00:03:17.200> to<00:03:17.560> which

00:03:17.910 --> 00:03:17.920 
which uses the quick charge to which

00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:20.340 
which uses the quick charge to which
once<00:03:18.130> you<00:03:18.250> charge<00:03:18.430> your<00:03:18.640> phone<00:03:18.960> down<00:03:19.960> fast

00:03:43.410 --> 00:03:43.420 
the gunmetal one is another one I were

00:03:43.420 --> 00:03:44.850 
the gunmetal one is another one I were
picking<00:03:43.600> up<00:03:43.810> because<00:03:44.020> I<00:03:44.110> really<00:03:44.470> like<00:03:44.710> the

00:03:44.850 --> 00:03:44.860 
picking up because I really like the

00:03:44.860 --> 00:03:47.010 
picking up because I really like the
gunmetal<00:03:45.100> walk<00:03:45.340> but<00:03:46.300> I'd<00:03:46.360> reckon<00:03:46.630> to<00:03:46.720> that<00:03:46.750> how

00:03:47.010 --> 00:03:47.020 
gunmetal walk but I'd reckon to that how

00:03:47.020 --> 00:03:49.140 
gunmetal walk but I'd reckon to that how
cool<00:03:47.290> is<00:03:47.410> that<00:03:47.440> look<00:03:47.680> straight<00:03:47.800> away<00:03:48.190> so<00:03:48.940> they

00:03:49.140 --> 00:03:49.150 
cool is that look straight away so they

00:03:49.150 --> 00:03:50.370 
cool is that look straight away so they
will<00:03:49.270> take<00:03:49.420> you<00:03:49.510> around<00:03:49.570> the<00:03:49.750> device<00:03:49.960> really

can just about so yep give me a bit of a

00:04:49.150 --> 00:04:51.659 
can just about so yep give me a bit of a
better<00:04:49.330> look<00:04:49.449> there<00:04:49.919> you<00:04:50.919> see<00:04:51.070> it<00:04:51.160> there<00:04:51.310> there

00:04:51.659 --> 00:04:51.669 
better look there you see it there there

00:04:51.669 --> 00:04:54.030 
better look there you see it there there
you<00:04:51.790> go<00:04:52.000> and<00:04:52.290> inside<00:04:53.290> they've<00:04:53.470> got<00:04:53.650> your<00:04:53.740> IR

00:04:54.030 --> 00:04:54.040 
you go and inside they've got your IR

00:04:54.040 --> 00:04:55.860 
you go and inside they've got your IR
blaster<00:04:54.340> as<00:04:54.400> well<00:04:54.580> so<00:04:55.030> when<00:04:55.449> you<00:04:55.479> think<00:04:55.720> of<00:04:55.810> it

00:04:55.860 --> 00:04:55.870 
blaster as well so when you think of it

00:04:55.870 --> 00:04:58.409 
blaster as well so when you think of it
as<00:04:56.020> a<00:04:56.050> remote<00:04:56.320> control<00:04:56.430> yes<00:04:57.430> it<00:04:57.669> really<00:04:58.000> can<00:04:58.210> be

00:04:58.409 --> 00:04:58.419 
as a remote control yes it really can be

00:04:58.419 --> 00:05:00.060 
as a remote control yes it really can be
da<00:04:58.810> remote<00:04:59.110> control<00:04:59.530> I<00:04:59.680> think<00:04:59.710> it<00:04:59.919> looks

00:05:00.060 --> 00:05:00.070 
da remote control I think it looks

00:05:00.070 --> 00:05:00.990 
da remote control I think it looks
pretty<00:05:00.310> damn<00:05:00.430> spiffy

00:05:00.990 --> 00:05:01.000 
pretty damn spiffy

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:02.969 
pretty damn spiffy
jumping<00:05:01.720> onto<00:05:01.840> the<00:05:01.990> back<00:05:02.139> of<00:05:02.169> it<00:05:02.440> yes<00:05:02.650> this<00:05:02.830> is

00:05:02.969 --> 00:05:02.979 
jumping onto the back of it yes this is

00:05:02.979 --> 00:05:04.860 
jumping onto the back of it yes this is
where<00:05:03.160> the<00:05:03.699> first<00:05:04.000> half<00:05:04.330> of<00:05:04.479> the<00:05:04.570> magic

00:05:04.860 --> 00:05:04.870 
where the first half of the magic

00:05:04.870 --> 00:05:07.860 
where the first half of the magic
happens<00:05:04.979> we've<00:05:05.979> got<00:05:06.190> our<00:05:06.479> depth<00:05:07.479> of<00:05:07.630> field

00:05:07.860 --> 00:05:07.870 
happens we've got our depth of field

00:05:07.870 --> 00:05:09.360 
happens we've got our depth of field
kind<00:05:08.139> of<00:05:08.199> camera<00:05:08.530> let's<00:05:08.710> see<00:05:08.919> I<00:05:09.100> think<00:05:09.160> it's

00:05:09.360 --> 00:05:09.370 
kind of camera let's see I think it's

00:05:09.370 --> 00:05:10.950 
kind of camera let's see I think it's
just<00:05:09.430> flaky<00:05:09.699> backgrounds<00:05:10.360> and<00:05:10.510> you

00:05:10.950 --> 00:05:10.960 
just flaky backgrounds and you

00:05:10.960 --> 00:05:13.350 
just flaky backgrounds and you
ultrapixel<00:05:11.680> now<00:05:12.130> there's<00:05:12.520> no<00:05:12.639> real<00:05:12.880> details

00:05:13.350 --> 00:05:13.360 
ultrapixel now there's no real details

00:05:13.360 --> 00:05:14.850 
ultrapixel now there's no real details
on<00:05:13.510> what<00:05:13.720> the<00:05:13.750> resolution<00:05:14.020> this<00:05:14.350> one<00:05:14.500> is<00:05:14.650> I

00:05:14.850 --> 00:05:14.860 
on what the resolution this one is I

00:05:14.860 --> 00:05:16.710 
on what the resolution this one is I
will<00:05:15.430> see<00:05:15.580> if<00:05:15.669> I<00:05:15.729> can<00:05:15.850> find<00:05:16.030> out<00:05:16.270> I'll<00:05:16.510> pull<00:05:16.690> up

00:05:16.710 --> 00:05:16.720 
will see if I can find out I'll pull up

00:05:16.720 --> 00:05:17.550 
will see if I can find out I'll pull up
another<00:05:16.990> video

00:05:17.550 --> 00:05:17.560 
another video

00:05:17.560 --> 00:05:21.029 
another video
you<00:05:18.160> got<00:05:18.310> you<00:05:18.400> two-tone<00:05:19.270> flash<00:05:19.470> which<00:05:20.470> from

00:05:21.029 --> 00:05:21.039 
you got you two-tone flash which from

00:05:21.039 --> 00:05:23.820 
you got you two-tone flash which from
what<00:05:21.190> I've<00:05:21.280> seen<00:05:21.310> so<00:05:21.669> far<00:05:22.470> doesn't<00:05:23.470> seem<00:05:23.590> great

00:05:23.820 --> 00:05:23.830 
what I've seen so far doesn't seem great

00:05:23.830 --> 00:05:25.620 
what I've seen so far doesn't seem great
but<00:05:23.860> we<00:05:24.340> will<00:05:24.580> learn<00:05:24.760> we<00:05:25.000> will<00:05:25.090> test<00:05:25.330> it<00:05:25.510> I'll

00:05:25.620 --> 00:05:25.630 
but we will learn we will test it I'll

00:05:25.630 --> 00:05:28.020 
but we will learn we will test it I'll
see<00:05:25.840> what<00:05:26.050> it's<00:05:26.139> like<00:05:26.340> so<00:05:27.340> you<00:05:27.669> got<00:05:27.789> your<00:05:27.850> hits

00:05:28.020 --> 00:05:28.030 
see what it's like so you got your hits

00:05:28.030 --> 00:05:30.090 
see what it's like so you got your hits
DC<00:05:28.360> lager<00:05:28.840> and<00:05:29.050> this<00:05:29.350> is<00:05:29.410> kind<00:05:29.560> of<00:05:29.590> similar<00:05:29.830> in

00:05:30.090 --> 00:05:30.100 
DC lager and this is kind of similar in

00:05:30.100 --> 00:05:31.620 
DC lager and this is kind of similar in
the<00:05:30.190> information<00:05:30.520> in<00:05:30.580> the<00:05:30.639> bottom<00:05:30.820> there<00:05:31.000> now

ultra pixel my I've done a video on it
in<00:05:34.750> the<00:05:34.810> past<00:05:34.889> it's<00:05:35.889> a<00:05:36.070> 4<00:05:36.310> megapixel

00:05:36.480 --> 00:05:36.490 
in the past it's a 4 megapixel

00:05:39.400 --> 00:05:41.820 
resolution size but the actual pixels
are<00:05:39.490> bigger<00:05:39.700> giving<00:05:40.479> you<00:05:40.660> should<00:05:41.229> be<00:05:41.410> better

00:05:41.820 --> 00:05:41.830 
are bigger giving you should be better

let's<00:06:15.340> go<00:06:15.490> figure

00:06:15.950 --> 00:06:15.960 
let's go figure

00:06:15.960 --> 00:06:18.270 
let's go figure
anyway<00:06:16.960> we'll<00:06:17.289> turn<00:06:17.470> the<00:06:17.590> device<00:06:17.710> on<00:06:18.010> for<00:06:18.220> the

00:06:18.270 --> 00:06:18.280 
anyway we'll turn the device on for the

00:06:18.280 --> 00:06:20.640 
anyway we'll turn the device on for the
first<00:06:18.430> time<00:06:18.580> although<00:06:19.050> see<00:06:20.050> what<00:06:20.260> it's<00:06:20.500> like

00:06:20.640 --> 00:06:20.650 
first time although see what it's like

00:06:20.650 --> 00:06:24.060
