00:00:44.709 --> 00:00:44.719 
ball through the bog scale so i get this

00:00:44.719 --> 00:00:48.229 
ball through the bog scale so i get this
and<00:00:45.719> they<00:00:46.410> drop<00:00:46.680> it<00:00:46.890> pretty<00:00:47.160> commonly<00:00:47.760> it's

00:00:48.229 --> 00:00:48.239 
and they drop it pretty commonly it's

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:50.569 
and they drop it pretty commonly it's
not<00:00:48.450> like<00:00:48.600> every<00:00:49.050> kill<00:00:49.289> but<00:00:50.129> you'll<00:00:50.309> probably

00:00:50.569 --> 00:00:50.579 
not like every kill but you'll probably

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:54.740 
not like every kill but you'll probably
get<00:00:50.850> it<00:00:51.030> every<00:00:51.449> three<00:00:52.289> or<00:00:52.379> four<00:00:52.530> kills<00:00:53.449> I'd<00:00:54.449> say

00:00:54.740 --> 00:00:54.750 
get it every three or four kills I'd say

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:56.900 
get it every three or four kills I'd say
that's<00:00:55.010> no<00:00:56.010> not<00:00:56.219> three<00:00:56.430> or<00:00:56.520> four<00:00:56.699> probably

00:00:56.900 --> 00:00:56.910 
that's no not three or four probably

00:00:56.910 --> 00:01:01.450 
that's no not three or four probably
five<00:00:57.360> but<00:00:58.350> they're<00:00:58.500> not<00:00:58.649> hard<00:00:58.890> to<00:00:58.980> kill<00:01:00.320> and

00:01:01.450 --> 00:01:01.460 
five but they're not hard to kill and

00:01:01.460 --> 00:01:05.450 
five but they're not hard to kill and
also<00:01:02.460> what<00:01:02.789> I<00:01:02.850> got<00:01:03.120> from<00:01:03.270> one<00:01:03.480> of<00:01:03.600> these<00:01:03.920> is<00:01:04.920> let

00:01:05.450 --> 00:01:05.460 
also what I got from one of these is let

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:13.550 
also what I got from one of these is let
me<00:01:05.580> get<00:01:05.729> this<00:01:05.909> open<00:01:06.740> Oh<00:01:09.650> rescue<00:01:11.119> hero<00:01:12.560> right

00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:13.560 
me get this open Oh rescue hero right

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:17.359 
me get this open Oh rescue hero right
here<00:01:13.670> it's<00:01:14.670> five<00:01:15.000> percent<00:01:15.630> magic<00:01:16.110> find<00:01:16.470> that's

00:01:17.359 --> 00:01:17.369 
here it's five percent magic find that's

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:21.740 
here it's five percent magic find that's
pretty<00:01:17.670> insane

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:21.750 

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:29.969 

so<00:01:23.460> hoping<00:01:24.460> i<00:01:24.579> can<00:01:24.640> get<00:01:24.909> one<00:01:25.119> here<00:01:25.420> and<00:01:28.979> i'm

00:01:29.969 --> 00:01:29.979 
so hoping i can get one here and i'm

00:01:29.979 --> 00:01:31.859 
so hoping i can get one here and i'm
saying<00:01:30.280> you<00:01:30.549> can<00:01:30.729> do<00:01:30.850> this<00:01:31.000> a<00:01:31.060> lot<00:01:31.270> faster<00:01:31.509> if

00:01:31.859 --> 00:01:31.869 
saying you can do this a lot faster if

00:01:31.869 --> 00:01:37.559 
saying you can do this a lot faster if
you<00:01:32.110> if<00:01:33.070> you're<00:01:33.399> using<00:01:33.700> on<00:01:36.030> you<00:01:37.030> can<00:01:37.210> probably

00:01:37.559 --> 00:01:37.569 
you if you're using on you can probably

00:01:37.569 --> 00:01:41.010 
you if you're using on you can probably
use<00:01:37.950> an<00:01:38.950> area<00:01:39.429> attack<00:01:40.000> so<00:01:40.600> you<00:01:40.659> can<00:01:40.899> get

00:01:41.010 --> 00:01:41.020 
use an area attack so you can get

00:01:41.020 --> 00:01:44.520 
use an area attack so you can get
multiple<00:01:41.590> at<00:01:41.740> the<00:01:41.890> same<00:01:42.100> time<00:01:43.289> there<00:01:44.289> we<00:01:44.409> go

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:44.530 
multiple at the same time there we go

00:01:44.530 --> 00:01:50.100 
multiple at the same time there we go
there's<00:01:44.770> one<00:01:46.829> and<00:01:47.829> in<00:01:48.549> our<00:01:48.810> experiencing<00:01:49.810> self

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:50.110 
there's one and in our experiencing self

00:01:50.110 --> 00:01:55.559 
there's one and in our experiencing self
or<00:01:50.289> like<00:01:50.409> one<00:01:50.709> silver<00:01:51.189> each<00:01:52.979> and<00:01:54.270> the<00:01:55.270> tried

00:01:55.559 --> 00:01:55.569 
or like one silver each and the tried

00:01:55.569 --> 00:01:59.429 
or like one silver each and the tried
then<00:01:56.049> just<00:01:56.890> after<00:01:57.099> you<00:01:57.280> 14,000<00:01:58.270> damage<00:01:58.659> can't

00:01:59.429 --> 00:01:59.439 
then just after you 14,000 damage can't

00:01:59.439 --> 00:02:01.710 
then just after you 14,000 damage can't
write<00:01:59.649> things<00:01:59.890> down<00:02:00.069> for<00:02:00.250> now<00:02:00.670> so<00:02:01.030> i<00:02:01.270> can't

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:01.720 
write things down for now so i can't

00:02:01.720 --> 00:02:03.270 
write things down for now so i can't
really<00:02:01.810> check<00:02:02.319> what<00:02:02.590> other<00:02:02.799> people<00:02:03.220> are

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:03.280 
really check what other people are

00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:04.559 
really check what other people are
buying<00:02:03.489> them<00:02:03.610> for<00:02:03.849> it<00:02:03.970> but<00:02:04.090> that's<00:02:04.239> what<00:02:04.539> I

00:02:04.559 --> 00:02:04.569 
buying them for it but that's what I

00:02:04.569 --> 00:02:12.000 
buying them for it but that's what I
sold<00:02:04.929> some<00:02:05.170> at<00:02:05.380> like<00:02:06.340> one<00:02:06.579> and<00:02:06.700> a<00:02:06.789> half<00:02:11.010> not

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:12.010 
sold some at like one and a half not

00:02:12.010 --> 00:02:15.150 
sold some at like one and a half not
there<00:02:12.220> there<00:02:12.489> so<00:02:13.420> as<00:02:13.599> you<00:02:13.630> can<00:02:13.930> see<00:02:14.170> there<00:02:14.410> like

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:15.160 
there there so as you can see there like

00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:19.770 
there there so as you can see there like
a<00:02:15.340> pretty<00:02:15.730> common<00:02:16.030> draw<00:02:16.680> and<00:02:17.849> now<00:02:18.849> if<00:02:19.450> you<00:02:19.629> look

00:02:19.770 --> 00:02:19.780 
a pretty common draw and now if you look

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:23.430 
a pretty common draw and now if you look
