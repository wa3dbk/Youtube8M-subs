00:00:05.930 --> 00:00:11.130
 Hello friends and guests of the channel with us 

00:00:08.849 --> 00:00:13.860
 Today is the third video on cars play and 

00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:16.440
 we will write the course for the loader 

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:18.750
 that he automatically gathered silage and his 

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:22.170
 here also sold especially conveniently 

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:24.869
 when you have a lot of silo and say you 

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:28.050
 loader 10 tons is you can imagine 

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:30.630
 submit if 1000 tons then it is necessary 

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:33.090
 at least a hundred times to go there 

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:35.640
 and it's pretty tiring, I think 

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:38.460
 therefore, we will help you just 

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:42.719
 by the way, so we start recording courses 

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:48.420
 approximately from this point start 

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:51.449
 record course slightly stretch forward and here 

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:54.960
 put a waiting point here with us 

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:58.020
 silo will be typed already yes I am to you 

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:59.940
 forgot to mention that the course record itself 

00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:02.609
 we will have two stages 

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:06.390
 the first stage is we are just with you 

00:01:02.609 --> 00:01:08.070
 paving the course I mean going to go on 

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:10.979
 the route we need 

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:16.619
 we reach here here until the end of the silage 

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:22.110
 we are putting a waiting point here changing 

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:26.549
 backward course and second stage 

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:28.759
 This is the most position of the bucket that's 

00:01:26.549 --> 00:01:33.420
 here are our loader shovels 

00:01:28.759 --> 00:01:36.360
 it will need to do separately here at 

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:40.259
 we have two stages with you and it will turn out so 

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:44.399
 here we turn out about here 

00:01:40.259 --> 00:01:47.340
 somewhere here and this is done 

00:01:44.399 --> 00:01:50.280
 in order to between our shifts 

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:53.180
 course was at least four points here 

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:56.100
 you see points 26 

00:01:53.180 --> 00:01:59.119
 so we stopped changing course 

00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:59.119
 on the forward direction 

00:01:59.509 --> 00:02:06.000
 drive forward like this 

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:09.270
 we turn you in to install 

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:10.340
 loader on the center of this pit and 

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:13.930
 desirable 

00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:13.930
 install it perpendicular 

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:24.680
 well that's approximate so here we are with 

00:02:21.439 --> 00:02:28.430
 again we put a waiting point we change 

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:32.060
 the course of the direction back we look at 40 

00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:34.400
 points should be 44 before we 

00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:35.379
 you will change course again to the position 

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:40.190
 forward 

00:02:35.379 --> 00:02:42.190
 42 43 44 cool principle from here we are 

00:02:40.190 --> 00:02:45.590
 we can already start freely with you 

00:02:42.190 --> 00:02:49.549
 change the course of the situation I mean 

00:02:45.590 --> 00:02:54.379
 direction of course forward pretty 

00:02:49.549 --> 00:02:56.989
 tangled course for lizard significantly 

00:02:54.379 --> 00:02:59.569
 more complicated than you and I recorded 

00:02:56.989 --> 00:03:02.060
 for fertilizer let's say some field 

00:02:59.569 --> 00:03:06.109
 or for harvesting for harvesting 

00:03:02.060 --> 00:03:08.870
 of course the easiest the easiest 

00:03:06.109 --> 00:03:11.180
 it was not a course for him to write 

00:03:08.870 --> 00:03:15.379
 Lizard that so we're somewhere here 

00:03:11.180 --> 00:03:18.620
 actions we stop we finish 

00:03:15.379 --> 00:03:22.819
 course record and now we need to write 

00:03:18.620 --> 00:03:26.540
 shovel position for loader 

00:03:22.819 --> 00:03:29.980
 and so the first is our loading position we 

00:03:26.540 --> 00:03:29.980
 with you we lower the shovel 

00:03:31.690 --> 00:03:36.660
 and put her in this position as if 

00:03:33.910 --> 00:03:38.890
 we would like to download it now 

00:03:36.660 --> 00:03:41.680
 click this one here it is 

00:03:38.890 --> 00:03:43.620
 turns green and you see ok 

00:03:41.680 --> 00:03:45.910
 we have the following transport position 

00:03:43.620 --> 00:03:49.770
 raise and somewhere like this 

00:03:45.910 --> 00:03:52.120
 approximately to prevent silage from spilling out 

00:03:49.770 --> 00:03:56.380
 set click ok again 

00:03:52.120 --> 00:03:59.710
 next position before unloading here 

00:03:56.380 --> 00:04:03.120
 it is desirable to raise a little bit like this 

00:03:59.710 --> 00:04:06.070
 nothing else change click and 

00:04:03.120 --> 00:04:11.730
 last position is unloading position 

00:04:06.070 --> 00:04:12.940
 that is, we are with you like this 

00:04:11.730 --> 00:04:15.400
 set 

00:04:12.940 --> 00:04:18.489
 and again we press the green color with us you 

00:04:15.400 --> 00:04:19.530
 see ok and the end of the discharge we have it 

00:04:18.489 --> 00:04:23.170
 worth 

00:04:19.530 --> 00:04:28.660
 Click so that he was on in English 

00:04:23.170 --> 00:04:30.670
 option it is he that is included ok by 

00:04:28.660 --> 00:04:33.310
 the idea we recorded the course 

00:04:30.670 --> 00:04:35.110
 now it would be necessary to save it 

00:04:33.310 --> 00:04:37.660
 the fact is that before his 

00:04:35.110 --> 00:04:40.150
 we can still save it with you 

00:04:37.660 --> 00:04:41.830
 edit for the beginning let's 

00:04:40.150 --> 00:04:46.380
 let's see how much we are 

00:04:41.830 --> 00:04:46.380
 did the right thing and so the route 

00:04:50.710 --> 00:04:57.220
 here we go here we are dialing to 

00:04:54.610 --> 00:05:02.650
 I even 

00:04:57.220 --> 00:05:04.960
 I will come out of this lizard and we 

00:05:02.650 --> 00:05:12.330
 let's see how it all comes from 

00:05:04.960 --> 00:05:15.750
 It looks like we are with you and handed over 

00:05:12.330 --> 00:05:20.410
 now go ahead changed course and 

00:05:15.750 --> 00:05:23.710
 now he turns out turns out 

00:05:20.410 --> 00:05:26.430
 to pour out you saw yes just now 

00:05:23.710 --> 00:05:33.750
 position before unloading raised the cake and 

00:05:26.430 --> 00:05:33.750
 great now 

00:05:35.139 --> 00:05:43.150
 we have added a denezhek 280 thousand 

00:05:39.129 --> 00:05:47.219
 there are 13 thousand for this one 

00:05:43.150 --> 00:05:50.469
 for one shovel and lisa to 10 tons and 

00:05:47.219 --> 00:05:53.529
 further he rode unfolds and this 

00:05:50.469 --> 00:06:00.969
 end of his route and again he starts 

00:05:53.529 --> 00:06:05.590
 everything drives up first picks up and so 

00:06:00.969 --> 00:06:07.509
 further in short for us it is very 

00:06:05.590 --> 00:06:11.020
 great help i don't know how for whom 

00:06:07.509 --> 00:06:15.129
 1 for me itâ€™s certainly for me here 

00:06:11.020 --> 00:06:18.779
 was you see more than a thousand tons of this 

00:06:15.129 --> 00:06:24.490
 here the silo itself here is 524 and 

00:06:18.779 --> 00:06:27.009
 here we had 600 for this here for 

00:06:24.490 --> 00:06:29.050
 I have already written down this silage pit 

00:06:27.009 --> 00:06:31.419
 route so we looked 

00:06:29.050 --> 00:06:35.169
 the route works all right everything 

00:06:31.419 --> 00:06:39.479
 Everything is sold as they say, because 

00:06:35.169 --> 00:06:39.479
 need we got you 

00:06:41.840 --> 00:06:46.820
 pours two hundred ninety two thousand kei 

00:06:44.990 --> 00:06:49.820
 now the most important thing is not with us 

00:06:46.820 --> 00:06:52.370
 forget to record this course so that 

00:06:49.820 --> 00:06:54.470
 next time you entered the game you with 

00:06:52.370 --> 00:06:56.570
 then we were surprised to see that the course 

00:06:54.470 --> 00:06:59.930
 then it does not have to but we describe 

00:06:56.570 --> 00:07:03.800
 for this you click on this one 

00:06:59.930 --> 00:07:10.900
 Well firstly finish the route secondly 

00:07:03.800 --> 00:07:10.900
 click save and write lizard 

00:07:11.229 --> 00:07:21.260
 further silage in 2 

00:07:15.610 --> 00:07:24.400
 ok check if we all signed up 

00:07:21.260 --> 00:07:27.050
 reset the course completely 

00:07:24.400 --> 00:07:31.120
 go here we find just now 

00:07:27.050 --> 00:07:36.760
 newly recorded course lizard force 2 

00:07:31.120 --> 00:07:36.760
 load it and run 

00:07:39.360 --> 00:07:41.840
 ok 

00:07:42.800 --> 00:07:45.729
 it all worked 

00:07:49.870 --> 00:07:55.540
 well on this i say goodbye to you i 

00:07:53.170 --> 00:07:57.760
 I hope that this video was useful to you 

00:07:55.540 --> 00:08:00.870
 thanks to all who watched 

00:07:57.760 --> 00:08:00.870
 bye everyone
