okay when I say eggs are good for you
most<00:00:22.680> people<00:00:22.980> will<00:00:23.130> sit<00:00:23.250> on<00:00:23.310> MC<00:00:23.670> alien<00:00:24.210> egg

00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:24.750 
most people will sit on MC alien egg

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:27.109 
most people will sit on MC alien egg
yolk<00:00:25.070> egg<00:00:26.070> yolk<00:00:26.340> is<00:00:26.519> basically<00:00:26.970> where

00:00:27.109 --> 00:00:27.119 
yolk egg yolk is basically where

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:28.490 
yolk egg yolk is basically where
everything<00:00:27.539> is<00:00:27.689> they<00:00:27.869> just<00:00:28.050> see<00:00:28.230> where<00:00:28.380> the

00:00:28.490 --> 00:00:28.500 
everything is they just see where the

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:30.800 
everything is they just see where the
neutrons<00:00:28.890> are<00:00:29.010> so<00:00:29.460> if<00:00:29.580> you<00:00:29.699> h0<00:00:30.090> nestle<00:00:30.480> you

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:30.810 
neutrons are so if you h0 nestle you

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:33.080 
neutrons are so if you h0 nestle you
removing<00:00:31.230> the<00:00:31.439> egg<00:00:31.560> yolk<00:00:31.920> from<00:00:32.550> uruguay

00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:33.090 
removing the egg yolk from uruguay

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:35.540 
removing the egg yolk from uruguay
you're<00:00:34.050> getting<00:00:34.290> nothing<00:00:34.559> else<00:00:34.739> and<00:00:34.950> majority

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:35.550 
you're getting nothing else and majority

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:37.459 
you're getting nothing else and majority
does<00:00:35.730> basically<00:00:35.969> when<00:00:36.239> we<00:00:36.360> have<00:00:36.510> eggs<00:00:36.809> which<00:00:37.260> I

00:00:37.459 --> 00:00:37.469 
does basically when we have eggs which I

00:00:37.469 --> 00:00:39.319 
does basically when we have eggs which I
the<00:00:37.530> fried<00:00:37.920> ball<00:00:38.250> number<00:00:38.760> one<00:00:38.940> so<00:00:39.120> the<00:00:39.239> egg

00:00:39.319 --> 00:00:39.329 
the fried ball number one so the egg

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:41.389 
the fried ball number one so the egg
whites<00:00:39.600> are<00:00:39.840> be<00:00:40.140> of<00:00:40.230> no<00:00:40.440> use<00:00:40.469> the<00:00:40.950> neutrons<00:00:41.280> are

00:00:41.389 --> 00:00:41.399 
whites are be of no use the neutrons are

00:00:41.399 --> 00:00:44.299 
whites are be of no use the neutrons are
denature<00:00:42.000> give<00:00:42.899> the<00:00:42.989> potential<00:00:43.379> in<00:00:43.530> nature<00:00:43.800> so

00:00:44.299 --> 00:00:44.309 
denature give the potential in nature so

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:45.560 
denature give the potential in nature so
unless<00:00:44.550> you<00:00:44.700> want<00:00:44.730> to<00:00:44.910> give<00:00:45.030> egg<00:00:45.149> whites<00:00:45.390> and

00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:45.570 
unless you want to give egg whites and

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:47.150 
unless you want to give egg whites and
just<00:00:46.289> take<00:00:46.410> it<00:00:46.559> wrong<00:00:46.739> that's<00:00:47.010> a<00:00:47.070> different

00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:47.160 
just take it wrong that's a different

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:49.549 
just take it wrong that's a different
story<00:00:47.370> all<00:00:48.059> right<00:00:48.210> but<00:00:48.690> if<00:00:48.750> you<00:00:49.170> take<00:00:49.320> give<00:00:49.469> an

00:00:49.549 --> 00:00:49.559 
story all right but if you take give an

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:51.470 
story all right but if you take give an
egg<00:00:49.739> whites<00:00:50.010> and<00:00:50.250> don't<00:00:50.879> take<00:00:51.000> the<00:00:51.090> egg<00:00:51.239> yolk

00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:51.480 
egg whites and don't take the egg yolk

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:54.139 
egg whites and don't take the egg yolk
there<00:00:52.230> is<00:00:52.289> no<00:00:52.440> benefit<00:00:52.860> it<00:00:53.039> must<00:00:53.370> be<00:00:53.489> together

00:00:54.139 --> 00:00:54.149 
there is no benefit it must be together

00:00:54.149 --> 00:00:56.150 
there is no benefit it must be together
you<00:00:54.809> must<00:00:54.989> have<00:00:55.079> two<00:00:55.199> egg<00:00:55.350> whites<00:00:55.379> and<00:00:55.739> a<00:00:55.949> group

00:00:56.150 --> 00:00:56.160 
you must have two egg whites and a group

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:57.770 
you must have two egg whites and a group
so<00:00:56.370> that<00:00:56.460> you<00:00:56.579> get<00:00:56.670> the<00:00:56.730> benefits<00:00:57.180> of<00:00:57.270> both<00:00:57.539> the

00:00:57.770 --> 00:00:57.780 
so that you get the benefits of both the

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:00.920 
so that you get the benefits of both the
egg<00:00:57.930> whites<00:00:58.260> and<00:00:58.410> egg<00:00:58.500> you<00:00:58.739> so<00:00:59.730> now<00:01:00.449> the<00:01:00.750> next

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:00.930 
egg whites and egg you so now the next

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:03.049 
egg whites and egg you so now the next
question<00:01:01.079> what<00:01:02.010> to<00:01:02.160> be<00:01:02.280> putting<00:01:02.609> basically

00:01:03.049 --> 00:01:03.059 
question what to be putting basically

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:04.340 
question what to be putting basically
why<00:01:03.270> do<00:01:03.329> we<00:01:03.539> put<00:01:03.690> think<00:01:03.809> the<00:01:03.899> base<00:01:04.049> the<00:01:04.199> egg

00:01:04.340 --> 00:01:04.350 
why do we put think the base the egg

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:06.980 
why do we put think the base the egg
yolks<00:01:04.589> are<00:01:04.830> a<00:01:05.070> bad<00:01:05.400> egg<00:01:06.210> yolks<00:01:06.450> are<00:01:06.600> all<00:01:06.840> the

00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:06.990 
yolks are a bad egg yolks are all the

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:08.270 
yolks are a bad egg yolks are all the
nutrients<00:01:07.409> they<00:01:07.470> are<00:01:07.710> studies<00:01:08.070> basically

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:08.280 
nutrients they are studies basically

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:10.070 
nutrients they are studies basically
found<00:01:08.760> in<00:01:08.939> quite<00:01:09.299> a<00:01:09.330> number<00:01:09.510> of<00:01:09.600> universities

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:10.080 
found in quite a number of universities

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:12.080 
found in quite a number of universities

and they actually claim that egg yolks

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:13.670 
and they actually claim that egg yolks
basically<00:01:12.600> do<00:01:12.750> not<00:01:12.990> increase<00:01:13.320> cholesterol

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:13.680 
basically do not increase cholesterol

dr. McClure shots will go are we met
again<00:01:31.979> yolks<00:01:32.369> I<00:01:32.610> said<00:01:33.420> he<00:01:33.570> is<00:01:33.600> not<00:01:33.689> basically

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:34.290 
again yolks I said he is not basically

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:36.469 
again yolks I said he is not basically
it's<00:01:34.560> been<00:01:34.710> proven<00:01:35.130> wrong<00:01:35.340> because<00:01:36.060> egg<00:01:36.240> yolks

00:01:36.469 --> 00:01:36.479 
it's been proven wrong because egg yolks

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:37.880 
it's been proven wrong because egg yolks
obviously<00:01:36.840> where<00:01:36.960> the<00:01:37.049> neutrons<00:01:37.409> are<00:01:37.560> now

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:37.890 
obviously where the neutrons are now

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:39.800 
obviously where the neutrons are now
what<00:01:38.490> are<00:01:38.610> the<00:01:38.670> benefits<00:01:38.820> of<00:01:39.090> a<00:01:39.210> gives<00:01:39.450> itself

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:39.810 
what are the benefits of a gives itself

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:42.830 
what are the benefits of a gives itself

so if someone's business suffering for
basely<00:01:51.270> I<00:01:51.329> dimension<00:01:52.020> egg<00:01:52.380> yolks<00:01:52.680> so<00:01:53.399> why

00:01:53.539 --> 00:01:53.549 
basely I dimension egg yolks so why

00:01:53.549 --> 00:01:54.679 
basely I dimension egg yolks so why
we're<00:01:53.729> going<00:01:53.909> to<00:01:53.970> see<00:01:54.060> the<00:01:54.149> rock<00:01:54.270> tapir<00:01:54.540> should

00:01:54.679 --> 00:01:54.689 
we're going to see the rock tapir should

00:01:54.689 --> 00:01:56.929 
we're going to see the rock tapir should
take<00:01:54.810> sufficient<00:01:55.049> amount<00:01:55.409> of<00:01:55.439> egg<00:01:55.619> yolks<00:01:55.939> now

00:01:56.929 --> 00:01:56.939 
take sufficient amount of egg yolks now

00:01:56.939 --> 00:01:58.940 
take sufficient amount of egg yolks now
next<00:01:57.509> person<00:01:57.899> will<00:01:58.020> be<00:01:58.170> basically<00:01:58.350> where<00:01:58.799> do

00:03:51.270 --> 00:03:51.280 
limitations but they are basically an

00:03:51.280 --> 00:03:53.220 
limitations but they are basically an
amount<00:03:52.150> that<00:03:52.300> you<00:03:52.480> should<00:03:52.660> you<00:03:52.750> not<00:03:52.930> daily

amount that you should you not daily
basis<00:03:53.590> now<00:03:54.130> i<00:03:54.400> would<00:03:54.910> say<00:03:55.390> about<00:03:55.990> an<00:03:56.800> egg<00:03:57.790> day

00:03:58.080 --> 00:03:58.090 
basis now i would say about an egg day

00:03:58.090 --> 00:04:00.690 
basis now i would say about an egg day
is<00:03:58.150> sufficient<00:03:58.960> most<00:03:59.590> of<00:03:59.770> us<00:03:59.980> I<00:04:00.220> believe<00:04:00.520> in

00:04:00.690 --> 00:04:00.700 
is sufficient most of us I believe in

00:04:00.700 --> 00:04:04.530 
is sufficient most of us I believe in
the<00:04:01.650> if<00:04:02.650> the<00:04:02.950> quality<00:04:03.340> of<00:04:03.370> the<00:04:03.550> group<00:04:03.760> and<00:04:03.910> each

00:04:04.530 --> 00:04:04.540 
the if the quality of the group and each

00:04:04.540 --> 00:04:06.360 
the if the quality of the group and each
basically<00:04:05.110> group<00:04:05.620> has<00:04:05.920> basically<00:04:06.250> a

00:04:06.360 --> 00:04:06.370 
basically group has basically a

00:04:06.370 --> 00:04:08.130 
basically group has basically a
limitation<00:04:06.850> and<00:04:07.030> if<00:04:07.150> your<00:04:07.300> blood<00:04:07.510> group<00:04:07.630> B<00:04:07.750> is

00:04:08.130 --> 00:04:08.140 
limitation and if your blood group B is

00:04:08.140 --> 00:04:13.290 
limitation and if your blood group B is
any<00:04:08.470> among<00:04:08.650> and<00:04:09.690> if<00:04:10.690> you<00:04:10.780> basically<00:04:11.140> a<00:04:11.700> bow<00:04:12.700> or

00:04:13.290 --> 00:04:13.300 
any among and if you basically a bow or

00:04:13.300 --> 00:04:16.320 
any among and if you basically a bow or
a<00:04:13.750> B<00:04:14.140> it's<00:04:14.470> about<00:04:15.340> five<00:04:15.640> to<00:04:15.760> six<00:04:15.880> eggs<00:04:16.090> a<00:04:16.209> week

00:04:16.320 --> 00:04:16.330 
a B it's about five to six eggs a week

00:04:16.330 --> 00:04:18.810 
a B it's about five to six eggs a week
now<00:04:17.230> how<00:04:17.620> do<00:04:17.680> you<00:04:17.830> cook<00:04:18.070> them<00:04:18.280> how<00:04:18.519> do<00:04:18.580> you<00:04:18.670> eat

00:04:18.810 --> 00:04:18.820 
now how do you cook them how do you eat

00:04:18.820 --> 00:04:20.520 
now how do you cook them how do you eat
them<00:04:18.970> is<00:04:19.120> basically<00:04:19.540> how<00:04:19.780> the<00:04:19.840> benefits<00:04:20.350> come

00:04:20.520 --> 00:04:20.530 
them is basically how the benefits come

00:04:20.530 --> 00:04:22.170 
them is basically how the benefits come
into<00:04:20.739> play<00:04:20.920> if<00:04:21.730> you're<00:04:21.910> looking<00:04:22.150> for

00:04:22.170 --> 00:04:22.180 
into play if you're looking for

00:04:22.180 --> 00:04:23.820 
into play if you're looking for
rheumatism<00:04:22.600> you<00:04:23.170> can<00:04:23.350> actually<00:04:23.440> have<00:04:23.710> them

00:04:23.820 --> 00:04:23.830 
rheumatism you can actually have them

00:04:23.830 --> 00:04:26.430 
rheumatism you can actually have them
about<00:04:24.130> two<00:04:24.280> weeks<00:04:24.430> a<00:04:24.760> day<00:04:25.000> and<00:04:25.240> it<00:04:26.170> doesn't

00:04:26.430 --> 00:04:26.440 
about two weeks a day and it doesn't

00:04:26.440 --> 00:04:28.050 
about two weeks a day and it doesn't
matter<00:04:26.590> basically<00:04:27.100> work<00:04:27.280> but<00:04:27.520> the<00:04:27.610> problem<00:04:28.000> is

00:04:28.050 --> 00:04:28.060 
matter basically work but the problem is

00:04:28.060 --> 00:04:29.790 
matter basically work but the problem is
how<00:04:28.180> do<00:04:28.240> you<00:04:28.360> eat<00:04:28.510> them<00:04:28.690> I<00:04:28.900> would<00:04:29.530> such<00:04:29.680> as

00:04:29.790 --> 00:04:29.800 
how do you eat them I would such as

00:04:29.800 --> 00:04:32.520 
how do you eat them I would such as
basically<00:04:30.180> half<00:04:31.180> ball<00:04:31.450> or<00:04:31.780> softball<00:04:32.170> there

00:04:32.520 --> 00:04:32.530 
basically half ball or softball there

00:04:32.530 --> 00:04:35.280 
basically half ball or softball there
will<00:04:32.650> be<00:04:32.680> the<00:04:32.860> best<00:04:33.090> because<00:04:34.090> a<00:04:34.120> half<00:04:34.750> a<00:04:34.900> leg<00:04:35.080> or

00:04:35.280 --> 00:04:35.290 
will be the best because a half a leg or

00:04:35.290 --> 00:04:37.320 
will be the best because a half a leg or
full<00:04:35.770> bolic<00:04:36.100> might<00:04:36.670> not<00:04:36.820> give<00:04:37.000> you<00:04:37.090> the<00:04:37.120> full

00:04:37.320 --> 00:04:37.330 
full bolic might not give you the full

00:04:37.330 --> 00:04:39.390 
full bolic might not give you the full
benefits<00:04:37.780> because<00:04:37.900> the<00:04:38.140> denaturation<00:04:38.620> of<00:04:38.740> the

00:04:39.390 --> 00:04:39.400 
benefits because the denaturation of the

00:04:39.400 --> 00:04:42.720 
benefits because the denaturation of the
proteins<00:04:39.790> radiations<00:04:40.360> eat<00:04:41.080> them<00:04:41.290> up<00:04:41.410> and<00:04:41.740> it

00:04:42.720 --> 00:04:42.730 
proteins radiations eat them up and it

00:04:42.730 --> 00:04:44.130 
proteins radiations eat them up and it
should<00:04:42.970> raise<00:04:43.180> a<00:04:43.210> little<00:04:43.450> bit<00:04:43.660> of<00:04:43.720> all<00:04:43.870> not

00:04:44.130 --> 00:04:44.140 
should raise a little bit of all not

00:04:44.140 --> 00:04:46.830 
should raise a little bit of all not
basically<00:04:44.440> cook<00:04:44.680> them<00:04:44.890> in<00:04:45.010> oh<00:04:45.130> so<00:04:45.850> hello<00:04:46.630> Dada

00:04:46.830 --> 00:04:46.840 
basically cook them in oh so hello Dada

00:04:46.840 --> 00:04:48.990 
basically cook them in oh so hello Dada
shouldn't<00:04:47.440> be<00:04:47.560> too<00:04:47.590> low<00:04:47.770> da<00:04:47.919> de<00:04:48.000> bourrée

shouldn't be too low da de bourrée

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:54.920 
shouldn't be too low da de bourrée
maximum<00:04:49.510> it<00:04:49.630> should<00:04:49.780> be<00:04:49.870> listed<00:04:50.230> on<00:04:50.320> like
