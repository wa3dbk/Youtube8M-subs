00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:42.410 
was like digital and I kind of wanted to

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:46.060 
was like digital and I kind of wanted to

asked me through my youtube channel just
about<00:01:00.620> like<00:01:01.489> the<00:01:01.610> techniques<00:01:02.000> I<00:01:02.210> use<00:01:02.420> they've

00:01:02.860 --> 00:01:02.870 
about like the techniques I use they've

00:01:02.870 --> 00:01:04.660 
about like the techniques I use they've
got<00:01:03.079> some<00:01:03.350> Copic<00:01:03.739> markers<00:01:04.160> and<00:01:04.399> they're

00:01:04.660 --> 00:01:04.670 
got some Copic markers and they're

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:06.190 
got some Copic markers and they're
looking<00:01:04.910> at<00:01:05.030> buying<00:01:05.239> some<00:01:05.570> Rhys<00:01:05.840> my<00:01:06.020> color

00:01:06.190 --> 00:01:06.200 
looking at buying some Rhys my color

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:08.680 
looking at buying some Rhys my color
pencils<00:01:06.410> just<00:01:06.970> to<00:01:07.970> kind<00:01:08.149> of<00:01:08.210> add<00:01:08.300> to<00:01:08.540> that

00:01:08.680 --> 00:01:08.690 
pencils just to kind of add to that

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:10.060 
pencils just to kind of add to that
because<00:01:09.140> that's<00:01:09.350> kind<00:01:09.590> of<00:01:09.619> a<00:01:09.680> technique<00:01:10.039> that

00:01:10.060 --> 00:01:10.070 
because that's kind of a technique that

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:12.550 
because that's kind of a technique that
I<00:01:10.250> use<00:01:10.910> a<00:01:10.940> lot<00:01:11.240> and<00:01:11.420> I<00:01:11.840> think<00:01:12.050> it's<00:01:12.140> really<00:01:12.320> good

00:01:12.550 --> 00:01:12.560 
I use a lot and I think it's really good

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:14.050 
I use a lot and I think it's really good
technique<00:01:13.220> and<00:01:13.399> it's<00:01:13.490> really<00:01:13.729> price

00:01:14.050 --> 00:01:14.060 
technique and it's really price

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:17.530 
technique and it's really price
effective<00:01:14.630> I<00:01:14.810> guess<00:01:15.050> because<00:01:15.830> you<00:01:16.430> don't<00:01:17.360> need

00:01:17.530 --> 00:01:17.540 
effective I guess because you don't need

00:01:17.540 --> 00:01:19.719 
effective I guess because you don't need
to<00:01:17.659> have<00:01:17.750> heaps<00:01:18.080> of<00:01:18.350> different<00:01:18.590> Copic<00:01:19.280> markers

00:01:19.719 --> 00:01:19.729 
to have heaps of different Copic markers

00:01:19.729 --> 00:01:21.910 
to have heaps of different Copic markers
because<00:01:20.240> you<00:01:20.630> can<00:01:20.840> just<00:01:21.049> kind<00:01:21.320> of<00:01:21.350> Laius<00:01:21.740> and

00:01:21.910 --> 00:01:21.920 
because you can just kind of Laius and

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:23.859 
because you can just kind of Laius and
pencil<00:01:22.250> on<00:01:22.369> top<00:01:22.640> to<00:01:22.970> get<00:01:23.090> the<00:01:23.240> extra<00:01:23.570> colors

00:01:23.859 --> 00:01:23.869 
pencil on top to get the extra colors

00:01:23.869 --> 00:01:25.510 
pencil on top to get the extra colors
that<00:01:24.020> you<00:01:24.080> might<00:01:24.229> need<00:01:24.409> and<00:01:24.590> that's<00:01:25.340> something

00:01:25.510 --> 00:01:25.520 
that you might need and that's something

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:27.670 
that you might need and that's something
that<00:01:25.760> I<00:01:25.790> still<00:01:26.090> do<00:01:26.240> a<00:01:26.270> lot<00:01:26.479> of<00:01:26.510> now<00:01:26.810> and<00:01:27.110> you

00:01:27.670 --> 00:01:27.680 
that I still do a lot of now and you

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:56.109 
don't even think it's a prismacolor
pencil<00:01:54.350> but<00:01:54.979> it's<00:01:55.100> just<00:01:55.250> a<00:01:55.310> black<00:01:55.490> pencil<00:01:55.759> and

00:01:56.109 --> 00:01:56.119 
pencil but it's just a black pencil and

00:01:56.119 --> 00:01:58.330 
pencil but it's just a black pencil and
then<00:01:56.869> that<00:01:57.079> kind<00:01:57.200> of<00:01:57.320> gives<00:01:57.920> it<00:01:58.040> the<00:01:58.159> extra

00:01:58.330 --> 00:01:58.340 
then that kind of gives it the extra

00:01:58.340 --> 00:02:00.100 
then that kind of gives it the extra
black<00:01:58.610> tones<00:01:58.880> without<00:01:59.180> being<00:01:59.420> as<00:01:59.540> harsh<00:01:59.810> as

00:02:00.100 --> 00:02:00.110 
black tones without being as harsh as

00:02:00.110 --> 00:02:03.490 
black tones without being as harsh as
like<00:02:00.320> it<00:02:00.530> Copic<00:02:01.310> mark<00:02:01.579> and<00:02:01.790> white<00:02:01.909> B<00:02:02.350> so<00:02:03.350> that's

00:02:03.490 --> 00:02:03.500 
like it Copic mark and white B so that's

00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:05.770 
like it Copic mark and white B so that's
kind<00:02:03.710> of<00:02:03.740> a<00:02:03.799> technique<00:02:04.100> I<00:02:04.280> use<00:02:04.460> a<00:02:04.490> lot<00:02:04.780> I've

00:02:05.770 --> 00:02:05.780 
kind of a technique I use a lot I've

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:09.460 
kind of a technique I use a lot I've
been<00:02:06.229> asked<00:02:06.829> to<00:02:06.890> do<00:02:07.189> like<00:02:08.119> tutorial<00:02:08.869> videos<00:02:09.200> on

and general tips in these videos as well
because<00:02:28.980> there's<00:02:29.130> nothing<00:02:29.400> like<00:02:29.520> super

00:02:29.960 --> 00:02:29.970 
because there's nothing like super

because there's nothing like super
complicated<00:02:30.540> about<00:02:30.660> what<00:02:30.930> I'm<00:02:31.020> doing

00:02:31.690 --> 00:02:31.700 
complicated about what I'm doing

00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:34.610 
complicated about what I'm doing
everything's<00:02:32.700> just<00:02:33.000> you<00:02:33.960> really<00:02:34.140> just<00:02:34.380> learn

00:02:34.610 --> 00:02:34.620 
everything's just you really just learn

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:37.100 
everything's just you really just learn
it<00:02:34.800> through<00:02:34.950> practice<00:02:35.490> I<00:02:35.790> know<00:02:36.660> it's<00:02:36.930> kind<00:02:37.080> of

00:02:37.100 --> 00:02:37.110 
it through practice I know it's kind of

00:02:37.110 --> 00:02:39.050 
it through practice I know it's kind of
cliche<00:02:37.590> but<00:02:38.220> it's<00:02:38.520> just<00:02:38.700> something<00:02:38.910> that

00:02:39.050 --> 00:02:39.060 
cliche but it's just something that

00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:41.540 
cliche but it's just something that
takes<00:02:39.480> time<00:02:39.660> it's<00:02:40.290> gonna<00:02:40.500> take<00:02:40.800> practice<00:02:41.310> and

00:02:41.540 --> 00:02:41.550 
takes time it's gonna take practice and

00:02:41.550 --> 00:02:43.310 
takes time it's gonna take practice and
it's<00:02:42.210> something<00:02:42.420> that<00:02:42.570> you<00:02:42.750> just<00:02:42.840> want<00:02:42.930> I

00:02:43.310 --> 00:02:43.320 
it's something that you just want I

think you got to learn by yourself
almost<00:02:45.420> like<00:02:45.720> tutorial<00:02:46.560> videos<00:02:47.180> they'll<00:02:48.180> give

00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:48.390 
almost like tutorial videos they'll give

00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:50.270 
almost like tutorial videos they'll give
you<00:02:48.540> some<00:02:48.840> tips<00:02:49.140> but<00:02:49.500> at<00:02:49.710> the<00:02:49.800> end<00:02:49.920> of<00:02:50.010> the<00:02:50.130> day

00:02:50.270 --> 00:02:50.280 
you some tips but at the end of the day

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:51.710 
you some tips but at the end of the day
it's<00:02:50.490> just<00:02:50.550> you've<00:02:51.000> got<00:02:51.030> to<00:02:51.270> apply<00:02:51.540> that

00:02:51.710 --> 00:02:51.720 
it's just you've got to apply that

00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:52.820 
it's just you've got to apply that
yourself<00:02:52.140> and<00:02:52.350> just<00:02:52.470> kind<00:02:52.650> of<00:02:52.680> keep

00:02:52.820 --> 00:02:52.830 
yourself and just kind of keep

00:02:52.830 --> 00:02:54.350 
yourself and just kind of keep
practicing<00:02:53.430> and<00:02:53.520> you'll<00:02:53.610> kind<00:02:53.850> of<00:02:53.880> pick<00:02:54.120> it<00:02:54.150> up

00:02:54.350 --> 00:02:54.360 
practicing and you'll kind of pick it up

00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:56.840 
practicing and you'll kind of pick it up
yourself<00:02:55.140> I<00:02:55.350> think<00:02:55.410> so<00:02:56.280> that's<00:02:56.430> probably<00:02:56.670> why

00:02:56.840 --> 00:02:56.850 
yourself I think so that's probably why

00:02:56.850 --> 00:02:59.480 
yourself I think so that's probably why
I'd<00:02:57.030> I<00:02:57.270> haven't<00:02:58.050> really<00:02:58.230> done<00:02:58.410> many<00:02:58.680> tutorial

00:03:21.660 --> 00:03:25.220 
it
I<00:03:21.690> just<00:03:22.620> layer<00:03:22.830> the<00:03:23.040> kopecks<00:03:23.430> first<00:03:24.140> kind<00:03:25.140> of

00:03:25.220 --> 00:03:25.230

00:03:36.199 --> 00:03:36.209 
kind of just picked up through drawing

00:03:36.209 --> 00:03:37.970 
kind of just picked up through drawing
one<00:03:36.989> thing<00:03:37.200> that<00:03:37.350> I've<00:03:37.470> kind<00:03:37.709> of<00:03:37.739> learned

00:03:37.970 --> 00:03:37.980 
one thing that I've kind of learned

00:03:37.980 --> 00:03:40.790 
one thing that I've kind of learned
through<00:03:38.940> drawing<00:03:39.269> and<00:03:40.080> this<00:03:40.260> kind<00:03:40.470> of<00:03:40.530> applies

00:03:40.790 --> 00:03:40.800 
through drawing and this kind of applies

00:03:40.800 --> 00:03:42.710 
through drawing and this kind of applies
to<00:03:41.010> a<00:03:41.040> lot<00:03:41.220> of<00:03:41.250> different<00:03:41.640> things<00:03:41.790> is<00:03:42.450> that

00:03:42.710 --> 00:03:42.720 
to a lot of different things is that

00:03:42.720 --> 00:03:43.940 
to a lot of different things is that
you're<00:03:42.840> never<00:03:43.019> going<00:03:43.200> to<00:03:43.260> be<00:03:43.350> perfect<00:03:43.530> when

00:03:43.940 --> 00:03:43.950 
you're never going to be perfect when

00:03:43.950 --> 00:03:45.650 
you're never going to be perfect when
you<00:03:44.070> start<00:03:44.400> out<00:03:44.550> it's<00:03:44.940> something<00:03:45.330> that<00:03:45.480> just

00:03:45.650 --> 00:03:45.660 
you start out it's something that just

00:03:45.660 --> 00:03:47.690 
you start out it's something that just
takes<00:03:45.930> lots<00:03:46.260> of<00:03:46.380> trial<00:03:46.709> and<00:03:46.890> error<00:03:47.010> and<00:03:47.310> lots

00:03:47.690 --> 00:03:47.700 
takes lots of trial and error and lots

00:03:47.700 --> 00:03:50.210 
takes lots of trial and error and lots
of<00:03:47.820> practice<00:03:48.269> to<00:03:48.420> actually<00:03:48.510> get<00:03:48.930> good<00:03:49.110> you<00:03:50.040> can

00:03:50.210 --> 00:03:50.220 
of practice to actually get good you can

00:03:50.220 --> 00:03:51.920 
of practice to actually get good you can
watch<00:03:50.370> as<00:03:50.489> many<00:03:50.610> kind<00:03:51.030> of<00:03:51.090> tutorials<00:03:51.720> and

00:03:51.920 --> 00:03:51.930

00:03:54.979 --> 00:03:54.989 
and kind of learn the theory and stuff

00:03:54.989 --> 00:03:57.020 
and kind of learn the theory and stuff
behind<00:03:55.170> everything<00:03:55.590> but<00:03:55.980> until<00:03:56.760> you<00:03:56.850> kind<00:03:57.000> of

00:03:57.020 --> 00:03:57.030 
behind everything but until you kind of

00:03:57.030 --> 00:03:59.660 
behind everything but until you kind of
just<00:03:57.209> apply<00:03:57.570> it<00:03:57.630> yourself<00:03:58.230> it's<00:03:59.010> not<00:03:59.340> really

00:03:59.660 --> 00:03:59.670 
just apply it yourself it's not really

00:03:59.670 --> 00:04:02.180 
just apply it yourself it's not really
gonna<00:03:59.989> know<00:04:00.989> it's<00:04:01.110> just<00:04:01.290> not<00:04:01.410> gonna<00:04:01.530> work<00:04:01.680> too

00:04:02.180 --> 00:04:02.190 
gonna know it's just not gonna work too

I'm<00:05:07.349> not<00:05:07.530> trying<00:05:07.650> to<00:05:07.770> be<00:05:07.860> rude<00:05:08.130> or<00:05:08.310> anything

00:05:08.390 --> 00:05:08.400 
I'm not trying to be rude or anything

00:05:08.400 --> 00:05:12.230 
I'm not trying to be rude or anything
but<00:05:08.990> I<00:05:09.990> just<00:05:10.139> kind<00:05:10.440> of<00:05:10.470> have<00:05:11.060> because<00:05:12.060> my

00:05:12.230 --> 00:05:12.240 
but I just kind of have because my

00:05:12.240 --> 00:05:14.689 
but I just kind of have because my
mentality<00:05:12.810> is<00:05:13.020> that<00:05:13.889> it's<00:05:14.190> something<00:05:14.430> that

00:05:14.689 --> 00:05:14.699 
mentality is that it's something that

00:05:14.699 --> 00:05:16.129 
mentality is that it's something that
you<00:05:14.819> should<00:05:14.849> kind<00:05:15.090> of<00:05:15.180> learn<00:05:15.419> as<00:05:15.630> an<00:05:15.750> artist

00:05:16.129 --> 00:05:16.139 
you should kind of learn as an artist

00:05:16.139 --> 00:05:19.279 
you should kind of learn as an artist
yourself<00:05:16.560> I<00:05:17.090> think<00:05:18.090> if<00:05:18.419> you<00:05:18.569> actually<00:05:18.750> think

00:05:19.279 --> 00:05:19.289 
yourself I think if you actually think

00:05:19.289 --> 00:05:21.709 
yourself I think if you actually think
about<00:05:19.860> what<00:05:20.159> colors<00:05:20.550> you<00:05:20.669> want<00:05:20.759> to<00:05:20.879> use<00:05:20.940> and

00:05:21.709 --> 00:05:21.719 
about what colors you want to use and

00:05:21.719 --> 00:05:23.420 
about what colors you want to use and
kind<00:05:21.900> of<00:05:21.930> put<00:05:22.139> the<00:05:22.289> effort<00:05:22.590> and<00:05:22.770> time<00:05:22.830> into

00:05:23.420 --> 00:05:23.430 
kind of put the effort and time into

00:05:23.430 --> 00:05:24.980 
kind of put the effort and time into
practicing<00:05:24.030> with<00:05:24.180> different<00:05:24.569> color

00:05:24.980 --> 00:05:24.990 
practicing with different color

00:05:24.990 --> 00:05:27.230 
practicing with different color
combinations<00:05:25.680> and<00:05:25.830> that<00:05:25.889> kind<00:05:26.129> of<00:05:26.159> thing<00:05:26.400> it

00:05:27.230 --> 00:05:27.240 
combinations and that kind of thing it

00:05:27.240 --> 00:05:28.700 
combinations and that kind of thing it
will<00:05:27.330> be<00:05:27.389> a<00:05:27.479> lot<00:05:27.659> more<00:05:27.780> beneficial<00:05:28.259> to<00:05:28.440> you

00:05:28.700 --> 00:05:28.710 
will be a lot more beneficial to you

00:05:28.710 --> 00:05:31.370 
will be a lot more beneficial to you
just<00:05:29.159> as<00:05:29.340> an<00:05:29.460> artist<00:05:29.819> in<00:05:29.940> general<00:05:30.330> then<00:05:30.630> just

00:05:31.370 --> 00:05:31.380 
just as an artist in general then just

00:05:31.380 --> 00:05:33.140 
just as an artist in general then just
for<00:05:31.560> asking<00:05:31.949> other<00:05:32.159> artists<00:05:32.610> what<00:05:32.759> they<00:05:32.909> use

00:05:33.140 --> 00:05:33.150 
for asking other artists what they use

00:05:33.150 --> 00:05:35.659 
for asking other artists what they use
and<00:05:33.479> copying<00:05:33.840> what<00:05:34.020> they<00:05:34.139> use<00:05:34.380> I<00:05:34.620> think<00:05:34.740> you

00:05:35.659 --> 00:05:35.669 
and copying what they use I think you

00:05:35.669 --> 00:05:37.850 
and copying what they use I think you
just<00:05:35.880> learn<00:05:36.060> a<00:05:36.090> lot<00:05:36.300> from<00:05:36.360> experimenting<00:05:37.319> like

00:05:37.850 --> 00:05:37.860 
just learn a lot from experimenting like

00:05:37.860 --> 00:05:39.379 
just learn a lot from experimenting like
you'll<00:05:38.009> make<00:05:38.190> some<00:05:38.460> mistakes<00:05:38.819> sometimes<00:05:39.270> it

00:05:39.379 --> 00:05:39.389 
you'll make some mistakes sometimes it

00:05:39.389 --> 00:05:40.670 
you'll make some mistakes sometimes it
won't<00:05:39.509> work<00:05:39.750> but<00:05:40.080> I<00:05:40.139> think<00:05:40.199> you'll<00:05:40.500> learn<00:05:40.620> a

00:05:40.670 --> 00:05:40.680 
won't work but I think you'll learn a

00:05:40.680 --> 00:05:42.860 
won't work but I think you'll learn a
lot<00:05:40.919> from<00:05:40.979> that<00:05:41.159> it<00:05:41.969> kind<00:05:42.240> of<00:05:42.300> reminds<00:05:42.750> me<00:05:42.779> of

00:05:42.860 --> 00:05:42.870 
lot from that it kind of reminds me of

00:05:42.870 --> 00:05:45.170 
lot from that it kind of reminds me of
the<00:05:43.110> same<00:05:43.349> give<00:05:44.159> a<00:05:44.190> man<00:05:44.460> a<00:05:44.490> fish<00:05:44.639> and<00:05:44.849> you<00:05:45.090> feed

00:05:45.170 --> 00:05:45.180 
the same give a man a fish and you feed

00:05:45.180 --> 00:05:48.080 
the same give a man a fish and you feed
him<00:05:45.389> for<00:05:45.539> a<00:05:45.779> day<00:05:45.810> teach<00:05:46.289> a<00:05:47.039> man<00:05:47.069> to<00:05:47.400> fish<00:05:47.580> and

00:05:48.080 --> 00:05:48.090 
him for a day teach a man to fish and

00:05:48.090 --> 00:05:50.719 
him for a day teach a man to fish and
you<00:05:48.150> feed<00:05:48.389> him<00:05:48.599> for<00:05:48.719> a<00:05:48.900> lifetime<00:05:49.310> maybe<00:05:50.310> that's

00:05:50.719 --> 00:05:50.729 
you feed him for a lifetime maybe that's

00:05:50.729 --> 00:05:53.269 
you feed him for a lifetime maybe that's
a<00:05:50.909> little<00:05:50.940> bit<00:05:51.409> too<00:05:52.409> deep<00:05:52.620> kind<00:05:52.979> of<00:05:53.039> looking

00:05:53.269 --> 00:05:53.279 
a little bit too deep kind of looking

00:05:53.279 --> 00:05:57.080 
a little bit too deep kind of looking
into<00:05:53.370> it<00:05:53.669> but<00:05:53.699> I<00:05:54.210> think<00:05:54.870> it's<00:05:55.610> that's<00:05:56.610> just<00:05:56.880> my

00:05:57.080 --> 00:05:57.090 
into it but I think it's that's just my

00:05:57.090 --> 00:05:59.360 
into it but I think it's that's just my
mentality<00:05:57.900> about<00:05:57.990> it<00:05:58.319> I<00:05:58.469> think<00:05:58.770> you'll<00:05:59.159> learn

00:05:59.360 --> 00:05:59.370 
mentality about it I think you'll learn

00:05:59.370 --> 00:06:01.640 
mentality about it I think you'll learn
more<00:05:59.430> if<00:06:00.419> you<00:06:00.630> figure<00:06:00.930> it<00:06:01.020> out<00:06:01.139> for<00:06:01.289> yourself

00:06:01.640 --> 00:06:01.650 
more if you figure it out for yourself

00:06:01.650 --> 00:06:03.230 
more if you figure it out for yourself
than<00:06:01.949> me<00:06:02.130> just<00:06:02.370> telling<00:06:02.699> you<00:06:02.759> what<00:06:02.909> colors<00:06:03.210> to

00:06:03.230 --> 00:06:03.240 
than me just telling you what colors to

00:06:03.240 --> 00:06:05.330 
than me just telling you what colors to
use<00:06:03.539> and<00:06:03.779> also<00:06:04.440> the<00:06:04.560> colors<00:06:04.860> that<00:06:04.979> I<00:06:05.039> use

00:06:05.330 --> 00:06:05.340 
use and also the colors that I use

00:06:05.340 --> 00:06:08.629 
use and also the colors that I use
aren't<00:06:05.669> even<00:06:05.940> the<00:06:06.690> best<00:06:06.990> color<00:06:07.319> options<00:06:07.830> a<00:06:08.159> lot

00:06:08.629 --> 00:06:08.639 
aren't even the best color options a lot

00:06:08.639 --> 00:06:10.339 
aren't even the best color options a lot
of<00:06:08.759> the<00:06:08.849> times<00:06:09.090> I'm<00:06:09.300> using<00:06:09.479> colors<00:06:09.960> because

00:06:10.339 --> 00:06:10.349 
of the times I'm using colors because

00:06:10.349 --> 00:06:12.800 
of the times I'm using colors because
that's<00:06:10.560> what<00:06:10.740> I've<00:06:10.860> got<00:06:11.099> and<00:06:11.449> if<00:06:12.449> I<00:06:12.569> had<00:06:12.779> the

00:06:12.800 --> 00:06:12.810 
that's what I've got and if I had the

00:06:12.810 --> 00:06:14.629 
that's what I've got and if I had the
full<00:06:13.080> set<00:06:13.319> of<00:06:13.349> kopecks<00:06:13.860> then<00:06:14.159> I<00:06:14.190> would<00:06:14.430> choose

00:06:14.629 --> 00:06:14.639 
full set of kopecks then I would choose

00:06:14.639 --> 00:06:16.670 
full set of kopecks then I would choose
completely<00:06:15.210> different<00:06:15.539> colors<00:06:15.840> so<00:06:16.469> that's

00:06:16.670 --> 00:06:16.680 
completely different colors so that's

00:06:16.680 --> 00:06:18.620 
completely different colors so that's
another<00:06:16.919> reason<00:06:17.159> why<00:06:17.430> I<00:06:17.460> don't<00:06:17.669> really<00:06:18.090> say

00:06:18.620 --> 00:06:18.630 
another reason why I don't really say

00:06:18.630 --> 00:06:20.959 
another reason why I don't really say
what<00:06:18.810> colors<00:06:19.110> I<00:06:19.229> use<00:06:19.500> I<00:06:19.740> don't<00:06:20.490> want<00:06:20.639> people<00:06:20.880> to

00:06:20.959 --> 00:06:20.969 
what colors I use I don't want people to

00:06:20.969 --> 00:06:22.249 
what colors I use I don't want people to
think<00:06:21.000> that<00:06:21.270> they<00:06:21.449> have<00:06:21.539> to<00:06:21.569> go<00:06:21.779> out<00:06:21.930> and<00:06:22.110> buy

00:06:22.249 --> 00:06:22.259 
think that they have to go out and buy

00:06:22.259 --> 00:06:24.080 
think that they have to go out and buy
the<00:06:22.319> exact<00:06:22.949> same<00:06:23.130> colors<00:06:23.520> that<00:06:23.550> I've<00:06:23.819> got

00:06:24.080 --> 00:06:24.090 
the exact same colors that I've got

00:06:24.090 --> 00:06:26.360 
the exact same colors that I've got
because<00:06:24.630> the<00:06:25.139> reality<00:06:25.440> is<00:06:25.680> you<00:06:25.830> just<00:06:26.190> kind<00:06:26.340> of

00:06:26.360 --> 00:06:26.370 
because the reality is you just kind of

00:06:26.370 --> 00:06:28.159 
because the reality is you just kind of
got<00:06:26.550> to<00:06:26.580> work<00:06:26.789> with<00:06:26.969> what<00:06:27.120> you've<00:06:27.240> got<00:06:27.270> and<00:06:27.690> you

00:06:28.159 --> 00:06:28.169 
got to work with what you've got and you

00:06:28.169 --> 00:06:29.990 
got to work with what you've got and you
can<00:06:28.349> still<00:06:28.620> make<00:06:28.770> an<00:06:28.919> awesome<00:06:29.219> drawing<00:06:29.520> even

00:06:29.990 --> 00:06:30.000 
can still make an awesome drawing even

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:31.430 
can still make an awesome drawing even
if<00:06:30.090> you<00:06:30.180> use<00:06:30.330> completely<00:06:30.839> different<00:06:30.930> colors

00:06:31.430 --> 00:06:31.440 
if you use completely different colors

00:06:31.440 --> 00:06:34.970 
if you use completely different colors
to<00:06:31.589> me<00:06:31.820> so<00:06:32.820> that's<00:06:33.180> my<00:06:33.389> rant<00:06:33.630> over

00:06:34.970 --> 00:06:34.980 
to me so that's my rant over

00:06:34.980 --> 00:06:36.710 
to me so that's my rant over
it's<00:06:35.190> probably<00:06:35.640> going<00:06:35.730> to<00:06:35.820> annoy<00:06:36.060> some<00:06:36.360> people

00:06:36.710 --> 00:06:36.720 
it's probably going to annoy some people

00:06:36.720 --> 00:06:39.080 
it's probably going to annoy some people
but<00:06:37.320> I<00:06:37.680> think<00:06:38.430> it's<00:06:38.550> going<00:06:38.670> to<00:06:38.700> help<00:06:38.820> you<00:06:38.970> in

00:06:39.080 --> 00:06:39.090 
but I think it's going to help you in

00:06:39.090 --> 00:06:42.110 
but I think it's going to help you in
the<00:06:39.180> long<00:06:39.210> run<00:06:39.540> so<00:06:40.700> yeah<00:06:41.700> that's<00:06:41.880> pretty<00:06:41.940> much

00:06:42.110 --> 00:06:42.120 
the long run so yeah that's pretty much

00:06:42.120 --> 00:06:44.420 
the long run so yeah that's pretty much
it<00:06:42.240> I'm<00:06:42.840> just<00:06:43.140> finishing<00:06:43.500> off<00:06:43.860> this<00:06:44.070> drawing

of<00:06:57.480> you<00:06:57.570> guys<00:06:57.720> who<00:06:57.900> asked<00:06:58.050> questions<00:06:58.170> and<00:06:58.890> if<00:06:59.190> I

00:06:59.270 --> 00:06:59.280 
of you guys who asked questions and if I

00:06:59.280 --> 00:07:01.010 
of you guys who asked questions and if I
don't<00:06:59.340> reply<00:06:59.940> it's<00:07:00.150> not<00:07:00.300> I<00:07:00.330> don't<00:07:00.510> want<00:07:00.930> to

00:07:01.010 --> 00:07:01.020 
don't reply it's not I don't want to

00:07:01.020 --> 00:07:02.870 
don't reply it's not I don't want to
it's<00:07:01.500> because<00:07:01.680> I<00:07:01.860> actually<00:07:02.070> can't

00:07:02.870 --> 00:07:02.880 
it's because I actually can't

00:07:02.880 --> 00:07:05.030 
it's because I actually can't
so<00:07:03.390> there's<00:07:03.720> videos<00:07:04.110> on<00:07:04.350> YouTube<00:07:04.710> I<00:07:04.830> think

00:07:05.030 --> 00:07:05.040 
so there's videos on YouTube I think

00:07:05.040 --> 00:07:06.560 
so there's videos on YouTube I think
showing<00:07:05.280> how<00:07:05.520> you<00:07:05.610> can<00:07:05.730> change<00:07:05.910> the<00:07:06.060> settings

00:07:06.560 --> 00:07:06.570 
showing how you can change the settings

00:07:06.570 --> 00:07:09.620 
showing how you can change the settings
but<00:07:06.900> it's<00:07:07.080> basically<00:07:07.440> because<00:07:07.710> Google+<00:07:08.630> is

00:07:09.620 --> 00:07:09.630 
but it's basically because Google+ is

00:07:09.630 --> 00:07:12.740 
but it's basically because Google+ is
set<00:07:10.110> to<00:07:10.410> only<00:07:11.220> your<00:07:11.670> friends<00:07:12.150> circle<00:07:12.360> or
