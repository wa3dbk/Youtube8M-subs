00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:05.580 
he'll probably hold it till after the

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:07.219 
he'll probably hold it till after the
elimination<00:01:05.970> chamber<00:01:06.330> pay-per-view<00:01:06.510> from

00:01:07.219 --> 00:01:07.229 
elimination chamber pay-per-view from

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:11.690 
elimination chamber pay-per-view from
looks<00:01:07.470> of<00:01:07.590> it<00:01:08.060> in<00:01:09.060> other<00:01:09.360> matches<00:01:10.310> CM<00:01:11.310> Punk

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:11.700 
looks of it in other matches CM Punk

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:14.330 
looks of it in other matches CM Punk
taking<00:01:12.450> on<00:01:12.570> Randy<00:01:12.780> Orton<00:01:13.040> that's<00:01:14.040> another<00:01:14.159> one

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:14.340 
taking on Randy Orton that's another one

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:16.219 
taking on Randy Orton that's another one
I've<00:01:14.430> heard<00:01:14.610> about<00:01:14.820> that<00:01:15.119> might<00:01:15.299> happen<00:01:15.540> looks

00:01:16.219 --> 00:01:16.229 
I've heard about that might happen looks

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:17.749 
I've heard about that might happen looks
like<00:01:16.320> it's<00:01:16.439> probably<00:01:16.530> going<00:01:16.860> to<00:01:17.009> I<00:01:17.159> mean<00:01:17.520> I

00:01:17.749 --> 00:01:17.759 
like it's probably going to I mean I

00:01:17.759 --> 00:01:21.499 
like it's probably going to I mean I
don't<00:01:18.360> think<00:01:18.960> that<00:01:19.020> the<00:01:19.500> CM<00:01:19.979> Punk<00:01:20.250> John<00:01:21.240> Cena

00:01:21.499 --> 00:01:21.509 
don't think that the CM Punk John Cena

00:01:21.509 --> 00:01:23.480 
don't think that the CM Punk John Cena
storyline<00:01:21.930> is<00:01:22.049> going<00:01:22.229> to<00:01:22.320> last<00:01:22.560> up<00:01:23.040> until

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:23.490 
storyline is going to last up until

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:25.249 
storyline is going to last up until
WrestleMania<00:01:23.820> I<00:01:24.540> think<00:01:24.780> it's<00:01:24.900> you<00:01:25.110> know<00:01:25.229> it's

00:01:25.249 --> 00:01:25.259 
WrestleMania I think it's you know it's

00:01:25.259 --> 00:01:27.910 
WrestleMania I think it's you know it's
a<00:01:25.710> pretty<00:01:25.890> long<00:01:26.130> feud<00:01:27.060> storyline<00:01:27.869> to

00:01:27.910 --> 00:01:27.920 
a pretty long feud storyline to

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:32.149 
a pretty long feud storyline to
continued<00:01:28.920> up<00:01:29.070> until<00:01:29.670> WrestleMania<00:01:31.040> they<00:01:32.040> may

00:01:32.149 --> 00:01:32.159 
continued up until WrestleMania they may

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:33.230 
continued up until WrestleMania they may
have<00:01:32.250> a<00:01:32.310> match<00:01:32.490> me<00:01:32.700> at<00:01:32.850> the<00:01:33.060> elimination

00:02:30.490 --> 00:02:30.500 
were heels at WrestleMania Sheamus

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:32.320 
were heels at WrestleMania Sheamus
versus<00:02:30.800> Triple<00:02:31.010> H<00:02:31.250> and<00:02:31.490> that's<00:02:31.670> obvious<00:02:32.150> of

00:02:32.320 --> 00:02:32.330 
versus Triple H and that's obvious of

00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:35.620 
versus Triple H and that's obvious of
course<00:02:32.360> I<00:02:32.810> mean<00:02:32.930> Triple<00:02:33.260> H<00:02:34.600> they've<00:02:35.600> really

00:02:35.620 --> 00:02:35.630 
course I mean Triple H they've really

00:02:35.630 --> 00:02:37.780 
course I mean Triple H they've really
been<00:02:35.900> do<00:02:36.320> too<00:02:36.530> good<00:02:36.680> of<00:02:36.740> a<00:02:36.800> job<00:02:36.830> with<00:02:37.340> Sheamus

00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:37.790 
been do too good of a job with Sheamus

00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:40.060 
been do too good of a job with Sheamus
my<00:02:38.390> opinion<00:02:38.840> they've<00:02:39.020> kind<00:02:39.710> of<00:02:39.740> been<00:02:39.800> Medic

00:02:40.060 --> 00:02:40.070 
my opinion they've kind of been Medic

00:02:40.070 --> 00:02:44.110 
my opinion they've kind of been Medic
come<00:02:40.190> amid<00:02:40.460> Carter<00:02:40.910> lately<00:02:41.450> but<00:02:42.200> I<00:02:43.120> guess

00:02:44.110 --> 00:02:44.120 
come amid Carter lately but I guess

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:46.270 
come amid Carter lately but I guess
because<00:02:44.600> when<00:02:45.080> he<00:02:45.140> comes<00:02:45.320> back<00:02:45.380> when<00:02:45.830> when<00:02:46.070> her

00:02:46.270 --> 00:02:46.280 
because when he comes back when when her

00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:47.290 
because when he comes back when when her
lace<00:02:46.400> comes<00:02:46.550> back<00:02:46.760> he's<00:02:47.000> probably<00:02:47.150> gonna

00:02:47.290 --> 00:02:47.300 
lace comes back he's probably gonna

00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:48.790 
lace comes back he's probably gonna
shame<00:02:47.840> supply<00:02:48.080> kit<00:02:48.200> will<00:02:48.290> lose<00:02:48.470> a<00:02:48.500> bunch<00:02:48.740> of

00:02:48.790 --> 00:02:48.800 
shame supply kit will lose a bunch of

00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:51.220 
shame supply kit will lose a bunch of
times<00:02:48.860> Triple<00:02:49.340> H<00:02:49.720> maybe<00:02:50.720> won't<00:02:50.840> really<00:02:51.050> matter

00:02:51.220 --> 00:02:51.230 
times Triple H maybe won't really matter

00:02:51.230 --> 00:02:53.530 
times Triple H maybe won't really matter
i<00:02:51.440> don't<00:02:51.680> know<00:02:51.770> of<00:02:52.220> course<00:02:52.430> you<00:02:52.730> know<00:02:52.790> Sheamus

00:02:53.530 --> 00:02:53.540 
i don't know of course you know Sheamus

00:02:53.540 --> 00:02:55.810 
i don't know of course you know Sheamus
is<00:02:53.600> a<00:02:53.660> King<00:02:54.020> Sheamus<00:02:54.470> he'll<00:02:54.950> replace<00:02:55.340> the<00:02:55.610> king

00:02:55.810 --> 00:02:55.820

is a King Sheamus he'll replace the king
of<00:02:55.940> kings<00:02:57.490> also<00:02:58.490> another<00:02:58.610> match<00:02:58.880> is<00:02:59.030> probably

00:02:59.290 --> 00:02:59.300 
of kings also another match is probably

00:02:59.300 --> 00:03:05.680 
of kings also another match is probably
will<00:02:59.450> happen<00:03:03.310> Nexus<00:03:04.310> taking<00:03:04.940> on<00:03:05.060> the<00:03:05.240> core

00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:05.690 
will happen Nexus taking on the core

00:03:05.690 --> 00:03:08.350 
will happen Nexus taking on the core
without<00:03:06.290> Wade<00:03:06.800> Barrett<00:03:07.220> and<00:03:07.280> CM<00:03:07.640> Punk<00:03:07.970> in<00:03:08.240> the

00:03:08.350 --> 00:03:08.360 
without Wade Barrett and CM Punk in the

00:03:08.360 --> 00:03:11.170 
without Wade Barrett and CM Punk in the
mash<00:03:08.570> probably<00:03:09.640> you<00:03:10.640> know<00:03:10.670> the<00:03:10.790> other<00:03:10.940> members

00:03:11.170 --> 00:03:11.180 
mash probably you know the other members

00:03:11.180 --> 00:03:14.800 
mash probably you know the other members
of<00:03:11.810> both<00:03:12.530> of<00:03:12.770> both<00:03:12.920> of<00:03:13.130> those<00:03:13.250> groups<00:03:13.720> I'm<00:03:14.720> not

00:03:14.800 --> 00:03:14.810 
of both of both of those groups I'm not

00:03:14.810 --> 00:03:16.480 
of both of both of those groups I'm not
sure<00:03:14.870> who<00:03:15.170> will<00:03:15.230> be<00:03:15.350> the<00:03:15.500> heel<00:03:15.680> in<00:03:15.770> the<00:03:15.860> face<00:03:16.100> I

00:03:16.480 --> 00:03:16.490 
sure who will be the heel in the face I

00:03:16.490 --> 00:03:19.060 
sure who will be the heel in the face I
suspect<00:03:16.940> probably<00:03:17.240> the<00:03:17.300> core<00:03:17.920> because<00:03:18.920> next

00:03:19.060 --> 00:03:19.070 
suspect probably the core because next

00:03:19.070 --> 00:03:20.590 
suspect probably the core because next
is<00:03:19.250> a<00:03:19.310> bit<00:03:19.400> around<00:03:19.610> longer<00:03:19.880> bigger<00:03:20.270> heels

00:03:20.590 --> 00:03:20.600 
is a bit around longer bigger heels

00:03:20.600 --> 00:03:22.240 
is a bit around longer bigger heels
maybe<00:03:20.870> or<00:03:21.110> may<00:03:21.260> next<00:03:21.590> to<00:03:21.680> be<00:03:21.770> the<00:03:21.860> babyfaces

00:03:22.240 --> 00:03:22.250 
maybe or may next to be the babyfaces

00:03:22.250 --> 00:03:26.050 
maybe or may next to be the babyfaces
we'll<00:03:22.520> see<00:03:23.709> but<00:03:24.709> I<00:03:24.980> suspect<00:03:25.250> to<00:03:25.520> see<00:03:25.730> a<00:03:25.760> punk

00:03:26.050 --> 00:03:26.060 
we'll see but I suspect to see a punk

00:03:26.060 --> 00:03:27.640 
we'll see but I suspect to see a punk
why<00:03:26.270> be<00:03:26.420> a<00:03:26.450> heel<00:03:26.810> if<00:03:27.020> he<00:03:27.110> goes<00:03:27.290> up<00:03:27.440> against

00:03:27.640 --> 00:03:27.650 
why be a heel if he goes up against

00:03:27.650 --> 00:03:30.820 
why be a heel if he goes up against
Randy<00:03:27.950> Orton<00:03:27.980> at<00:03:28.280> this<00:03:28.430> WrestleMania<00:03:29.830> also

00:03:30.820 --> 00:03:30.830 
Randy Orton at this WrestleMania also

00:03:30.830 --> 00:03:34.750 
Randy Orton at this WrestleMania also
another<00:03:31.280> match<00:03:31.610> that<00:03:32.510> the<00:03:32.750> teased<00:03:33.320> in<00:03:33.800> the

00:03:34.750 --> 00:03:34.760 
another match that the teased in the

00:03:34.760 --> 00:03:37.900 
another match that the teased in the
past<00:03:35.030> Undertaker<00:03:35.470> versus<00:03:36.470> Wade<00:03:36.740> Barrett<00:03:37.280> it

00:03:37.900 --> 00:03:37.910 
past Undertaker versus Wade Barrett it

00:03:37.910 --> 00:03:39.130 
past Undertaker versus Wade Barrett it
looks<00:03:38.120> like<00:03:38.270> the<00:03:38.360> point<00:03:38.540> i<00:03:38.600> could<00:03:38.720> have<00:03:38.930> Brock

00:03:39.130 --> 00:03:39.140 
looks like the point i could have Brock

00:03:39.140 --> 00:03:42.580 
looks like the point i could have Brock
Lesnar<00:03:39.560> against<00:03:40.510> the<00:03:41.510> Undertaker<00:03:41.720> obviously

00:03:42.580 --> 00:03:42.590 
Lesnar against the Undertaker obviously

00:03:42.590 --> 00:03:43.990 
Lesnar against the Undertaker obviously
so<00:03:42.890> there<00:03:43.040> if<00:03:43.100> I<00:03:43.160> can<00:03:43.310> go<00:03:43.370> with<00:03:43.489> laid<00:03:43.640> bare<00:03:43.790> the

00:03:43.990 --> 00:03:44.000 
so there if I can go with laid bare the

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:45.640 
so there if I can go with laid bare the
Undertaker<00:03:44.330> i<00:03:44.420> don't<00:03:44.600> i<00:03:45.080> don't<00:03:45.110> see<00:03:45.440> bear

00:03:45.640 --> 00:03:45.650 
Undertaker i don't i don't see bear

00:03:45.650 --> 00:03:47.500 
Undertaker i don't i don't see bear
winning<00:03:46.130> but<00:03:46.790> stranger<00:03:47.209> things<00:03:47.239> have

00:04:37.790 --> 00:04:39.010 
match for the I seat I'll wrestle man

00:04:39.010 --> 00:04:39.020 
you'll probably be a multi man match

00:04:39.020 --> 00:04:39.910 
you'll probably be a multi man match
because<00:04:39.170> obviously<00:04:39.350> not<00:04:39.650> going<00:04:39.740> to<00:04:39.830> have

00:04:39.910 --> 00:04:39.920 
because obviously not going to have

00:04:39.920 --> 00:04:40.810 
because obviously not going to have
money<00:04:40.070> in<00:04:40.160> the<00:04:40.220> bank<00:04:40.370> because<00:04:40.550> they're<00:04:40.730> gonna

00:04:40.810 --> 00:04:40.820

the money bank pay-per-view again

00:04:41.930 --> 00:04:44.230 
the money bank pay-per-view again
probably<00:04:42.590> the<00:04:42.830> looks<00:04:43.040> of<00:04:43.130> it<00:04:43.220> so<00:04:43.790> I<00:04:43.820> have<00:04:44.030> money

00:04:44.230 --> 00:04:44.240

in<00:04:44.360> the<00:04:44.420> bank<00:04:44.570> they'll<00:04:45.380> probably<00:04:45.410> have<00:04:45.650> a

00:04:45.760 --> 00:04:45.770 
in the bank they'll probably have a

00:04:45.770 --> 00:04:48.490 
in the bank they'll probably have a
multi<00:04:46.160> man<00:04:46.310> match<00:04:46.520> of<00:04:46.850> her<00:04:47.690> you<00:04:47.870> know<00:04:47.960> be<00:04:48.140> four

would<00:04:57.050> have<00:04:57.140> to<00:04:57.230> say<00:04:57.260> probably<00:04:57.740> Daniel<00:04:58.730> Bryan

00:04:58.990 --> 00:04:59.000 
would have to say probably Daniel Bryan

would have to say probably Daniel Bryan
defending<00:04:59.570> as<00:04:59.660> John<00:04:59.900> Morrison<00:05:01.360> that<00:05:02.360> could<00:05:02.540> be

00:05:02.680 --> 00:05:02.690 
defending as John Morrison that could be

00:05:02.690 --> 00:05:04.330 
defending as John Morrison that could be
a<00:05:02.720> possible<00:05:03.170> show<00:05:03.440> stealer<00:05:03.890> because<00:05:04.100> they<00:05:04.190> had

00:05:04.330 --> 00:05:04.340 
a possible show stealer because they had

00:05:04.340 --> 00:05:05.740 
a possible show stealer because they had
a<00:05:04.370> mattress<00:05:04.550> again<00:05:04.850> Raleigh<00:05:05.150> was<00:05:05.300> good<00:05:05.540> but<00:05:05.690> it

00:05:05.740 --> 00:05:05.750 
a mattress again Raleigh was good but it

00:05:05.750 --> 00:05:09.460 
a mattress again Raleigh was good but it
was<00:05:05.870> only<00:05:05.930> five<00:05:06.140> minutes<00:05:08.170> another<00:05:09.170> match

00:05:09.460 --> 00:05:09.470 
was only five minutes another match

00:05:09.470 --> 00:05:12.090 
was only five minutes another match
probably<00:05:10.250> they've<00:05:10.460> been<00:05:10.970> you<00:05:11.600> know<00:05:11.690> they

00:05:12.090 --> 00:05:12.100 
probably they've been you know they

00:05:12.100 --> 00:05:14.500 
probably they've been you know they
possibly<00:05:13.100> might<00:05:13.340> happen<00:05:13.730> is<00:05:13.880> Beth<00:05:14.240> Phoenix

00:05:14.500 --> 00:05:14.510 
possibly might happen is Beth Phoenix

00:05:14.510 --> 00:05:19.170 
possibly might happen is Beth Phoenix
versus<00:05:14.960> Natalia<00:05:15.500> that's<00:05:15.740> a<00:05:15.940> probably<00:05:16.940> a<00:05:17.060> given

00:05:19.170 --> 00:05:19.180 
versus Natalia that's a probably a given

00:05:19.180 --> 00:05:22.920 
versus Natalia that's a probably a given
Jerry<00:05:20.180> Lawler<00:05:20.630> vs.<00:05:21.260> Michael<00:05:21.410> Cole<00:05:21.800> I<00:05:22.100> mean<00:05:22.370> and

00:05:22.920 --> 00:05:22.930 
Jerry Lawler vs. Michael Cole I mean and

00:05:22.930 --> 00:05:26.080 
Jerry Lawler vs. Michael Cole I mean and
I<00:05:23.930> think<00:05:23.990> as<00:05:24.380> a<00:05:24.410> possibility<00:05:24.890> why<00:05:25.670> not<00:05:25.850> have

00:05:26.080 --> 00:05:26.090 
I think as a possibility why not have

00:05:26.090 --> 00:05:28.060 
I think as a possibility why not have
Jim<00:05:26.630> Ross<00:05:26.840> is<00:05:27.020> the<00:05:27.080> guest<00:05:27.260> referee<00:05:27.410> so<00:05:27.980> as<00:05:28.040> it

00:05:28.060 --> 00:05:28.070 
Jim Ross is the guest referee so as it

00:05:28.070 --> 00:05:30.220 
Jim Ross is the guest referee so as it
gets<00:05:28.280> for<00:05:28.310> free<00:05:28.580> he<00:05:29.030> recently<00:05:29.210> did<00:05:30.020> guest

00:05:34.140 --> 00:05:34.150 
referee spot after episode of smackdown

00:05:34.150 --> 00:05:39.580 
referee spot after episode of smackdown
and<00:05:36.850> I<00:05:37.850> think<00:05:38.360> obviously<00:05:38.750> they're<00:05:39.320> they're
