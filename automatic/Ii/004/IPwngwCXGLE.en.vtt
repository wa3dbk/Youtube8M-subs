so I had some extra cal lumber some of

00:00:03.330 --> 00:00:06.700 
so I had some extra cal lumber some of
these<00:00:03.449> two<00:00:04.200> by<00:00:04.350> fours<00:00:04.680> and<00:00:04.799> two<00:00:05.130> by<00:00:05.310> twos<00:00:05.640> and

00:00:06.700 --> 00:00:06.710 
these two by fours and two by twos and

00:00:06.710 --> 00:00:10.120 
these two by fours and two by twos and
they're<00:00:07.710> all<00:00:07.830> twisted<00:00:08.250> up<00:00:08.400> and<00:00:08.639> cracked<00:00:08.940> but<00:00:09.330> I

00:00:10.120 --> 00:00:10.130 
they're all twisted up and cracked but I

00:00:10.130 --> 00:00:12.950 
they're all twisted up and cracked but I
wanted<00:00:11.130> to<00:00:11.190> put<00:00:11.460> them<00:00:11.610> to<00:00:11.759> good<00:00:11.910> use<00:00:12.120> and<00:00:12.150> I<00:00:12.540> had

00:00:12.950 --> 00:00:12.960 
wanted to put them to good use and I had

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:18.050 
wanted to put them to good use and I had
all<00:00:13.139> this<00:00:13.759> firewood<00:00:14.759> to<00:00:14.910> book<00:00:15.120> up<00:00:15.330> buck<00:00:15.690> up<00:00:17.060> but

00:00:18.050 --> 00:00:18.060 
all this firewood to book up buck up but

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:21.500 
all this firewood to book up buck up but
last<00:00:18.660> year<00:00:18.900> took<00:00:19.140> me<00:00:19.320> so<00:00:19.529> long<00:00:19.820> so<00:00:20.820> I<00:00:21.090> decided

00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:21.510 
last year took me so long so I decided

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:25.220 
last year took me so long so I decided
to<00:00:21.630> build<00:00:21.810> this<00:00:22.020> rack<00:00:22.350> and<00:00:23.720> the<00:00:24.720> way<00:00:24.840> I<00:00:24.869> built

00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:25.230 
to build this rack and the way I built

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:28.339 
to build this rack and the way I built
it<00:00:25.439> was<00:00:25.910> I've<00:00:26.910> got<00:00:27.119> a<00:00:27.150> two<00:00:27.420> foot<00:00:27.660> bar<00:00:27.930> on<00:00:28.170> this

00:00:28.339 --> 00:00:28.349 
it was I've got a two foot bar on this

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:32.269 
it was I've got a two foot bar on this
husky<00:00:28.650> I<00:00:29.390> built<00:00:30.390> it<00:00:30.570> so<00:00:30.720> I<00:00:30.779> can<00:00:30.990> easily<00:00:31.170> get<00:00:31.650> the

00:00:32.269 --> 00:00:32.279 
husky I built it so I can easily get the

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:36.979 
husky I built it so I can easily get the
bar<00:00:32.520> through<00:00:32.899> and<00:00:35.000> this<00:00:36.000> rack<00:00:36.360> what<00:00:36.660> it<00:00:36.780> does

00:00:36.979 --> 00:00:36.989 
bar through and this rack what it does

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:39.770 
bar through and this rack what it does
is<00:00:37.399> it<00:00:38.399> could<00:00:38.670> be<00:00:38.820> a<00:00:38.850> lot<00:00:39.059> better<00:00:39.300> and<00:00:39.540> stronger

00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:39.780 
is it could be a lot better and stronger

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:43.580 
is it could be a lot better and stronger
but<00:00:40.140> this<00:00:40.350> this<00:00:40.770> is<00:00:40.980> the<00:00:41.070> material<00:00:41.550> I<00:00:41.640> had<00:00:41.910> so<00:00:42.590> I

00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:43.590 
but this this is the material I had so I

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:47.630 
but this this is the material I had so I
space<00:00:44.579> these<00:00:44.910> so<00:00:45.239> that<00:00:45.270> the<00:00:45.600> cut<00:00:46.370> lines<00:00:47.370> would

00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:47.640 
space these so that the cut lines would

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:51.680 
space these so that the cut lines would
be<00:00:47.700> no<00:00:48.600> more<00:00:48.809> than<00:00:48.989> 16<00:00:49.410> inches<00:00:49.590> apart<00:00:50.690> whenever

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:51.690 
be no more than 16 inches apart whenever

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:54.979 
be no more than 16 inches apart whenever
I<00:00:51.780> go<00:00:52.110> out<00:00:52.140> to<00:00:52.350> the<00:00:52.440> bush<00:00:52.710> I<00:00:53.390> always<00:00:54.390> kept<00:00:54.870> my

00:00:54.979 --> 00:00:54.989 
I go out to the bush I always kept my

00:00:54.989 --> 00:00:57.950 
I go out to the bush I always kept my
lengths<00:00:55.590> out<00:00:55.770> in<00:00:55.890> the<00:00:55.980> bush<00:00:56.160> at<00:00:56.399> 18<00:00:56.760> foot<00:00:57.000> so<00:00:57.930> I

00:00:57.950 --> 00:00:57.960 
lengths out in the bush at 18 foot so I

00:00:57.960 --> 00:00:59.720 
lengths out in the bush at 18 foot so I
can<00:00:58.260> take<00:00:58.440> my<00:00:58.500> time<00:00:58.649> bucking<00:00:59.219> it<00:00:59.340> up<00:00:59.460> whenever

00:00:59.720 --> 00:00:59.730 
can take my time bucking it up whenever

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:01.220 
can take my time bucking it up whenever
I<00:00:59.910> get<00:00:59.969> home<00:01:00.270> instead<00:01:00.629> of<00:01:00.690> spending<00:01:01.050> all<00:01:01.170> day

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:01.230 
I get home instead of spending all day

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:04.640 
I get home instead of spending all day
on<00:01:01.530> the<00:01:01.680> bush<00:01:02.329> so<00:01:03.329> I<00:01:03.359> I<00:01:03.690> can<00:01:04.110> usually<00:01:04.290> carry

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:04.650 
on the bush so I I can usually carry

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:08.300 
on the bush so I I can usually carry
them<00:01:04.860> by<00:01:04.979> myself<00:01:05.430> no<00:01:05.640> problem<00:01:06.030> at<00:01:06.150> 8<00:01:06.299> feet<00:01:06.979> so<00:01:07.979> I

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:08.310 
them by myself no problem at 8 feet so I

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:10.280 
them by myself no problem at 8 feet so I
cut<00:01:08.760> them<00:01:08.880> all<00:01:08.970> out<00:01:09.000> eight<00:01:09.270> feet<00:01:09.510> anyway<00:01:09.990> and

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:10.290 
cut them all out eight feet anyway and

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:12.440 
cut them all out eight feet anyway and
that's<00:01:10.530> they<00:01:11.159> fit<00:01:11.400> nicely<00:01:11.610> in<00:01:11.850> my<00:01:11.909> truck<00:01:12.210> that

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:12.450 
that's they fit nicely in my truck that

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:16.219 
that's they fit nicely in my truck that
way<00:01:12.710> so<00:01:13.710> anyway<00:01:14.070> I<00:01:14.670> built<00:01:15.330> this<00:01:15.479> rack

00:01:16.219 --> 00:01:16.229 
way so anyway I built this rack

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:21.830 
way so anyway I built this rack
I<00:01:16.850> fit<00:01:17.869> 27<00:01:18.869> of<00:01:19.080> these<00:01:19.729> logs<00:01:20.729> in<00:01:21.090> there<00:01:21.390> not<00:01:21.509> huge

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:21.840 
I fit 27 of these logs in there not huge

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:25.760 
I fit 27 of these logs in there not huge
logs<00:01:22.140> but<00:01:23.540> you<00:01:24.540> could<00:01:24.720> build<00:01:24.869> a<00:01:25.020> rock<00:01:25.200> any<00:01:25.439> size

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:25.770 
logs but you could build a rock any size

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:29.539 
logs but you could build a rock any size
of<00:01:26.040> the<00:01:26.130> average<00:01:27.049> size<00:01:28.049> of<00:01:28.259> tree<00:01:28.470> you<00:01:28.500> have<00:01:28.650> but

00:01:29.539 --> 00:01:29.549 
of the average size of tree you have but

00:01:29.549 --> 00:01:33.620 
of the average size of tree you have but
I<00:01:29.909> can<00:01:30.210> fit<00:01:30.450> 27<00:01:31.170> logs<00:01:31.439> on<00:01:31.860> average<00:01:32.369> in<00:01:32.640> this

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:33.630 
I can fit 27 logs on average in this

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:37.850 
I can fit 27 logs on average in this
rack<00:01:34.200> vertically<00:01:34.920> and<00:01:36.110> they're<00:01:37.110> already<00:01:37.290> feet

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:37.860 
rack vertically and they're already feet

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:39.700 
rack vertically and they're already feet
and<00:01:38.130> then<00:01:38.220> these<00:01:38.460> are<00:01:38.640> spaced<00:01:39.000> apart

00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:39.710 
and then these are spaced apart

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:45.319 
and then these are spaced apart
it<00:01:40.710> took<00:01:40.890> me<00:01:41.869> no<00:01:42.869> time<00:01:42.899> to<00:01:43.320> load<00:01:43.500> it<00:01:43.710> and<00:01:44.549> it

00:01:45.319 --> 00:01:45.329 
it took me no time to load it and it

00:01:45.329 --> 00:01:50.450 
it took me no time to load it and it
took<00:01:45.509> me<00:01:47.990> no<00:01:48.990> more<00:01:49.229> than<00:01:49.439> five<00:01:49.680> minutes<00:01:50.220> I

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:50.460 
took me no more than five minutes I

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:53.960 
took me no more than five minutes I
timed<00:01:51.149> it<00:01:51.329> actually<00:01:51.689> was<00:01:51.810> a<00:01:51.840> book<00:01:52.079> almost<00:01:52.970> five

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:53.970 
timed it actually was a book almost five

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:58.670 
timed it actually was a book almost five
minutes<00:01:54.240> within<00:01:54.750> a<00:01:54.840> few<00:01:55.079> seconds<00:01:55.880> to<00:01:57.409> buck<00:01:58.409> all

to<00:02:04.500> go<00:02:04.770> and<00:02:06.500> I<00:02:07.500> did<00:02:08.369> try<00:02:08.700> and<00:02:08.759> do<00:02:09.030> it<00:02:09.149> without

00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:09.360 
to go and I did try and do it without

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:13.260 
to go and I did try and do it without
this<00:02:09.750> top<00:02:10.050> brace<00:02:10.379> and<00:02:11.360> it<00:02:12.360> didn't<00:02:12.629> work

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:13.270 
this top brace and it didn't work

00:02:13.270 --> 00:02:16.140 
this top brace and it didn't work
it<00:02:13.510> was<00:02:13.960> okay<00:02:14.320> up<00:02:14.470> until<00:02:14.710> I<00:02:15.130> stacked<00:02:16.030> them

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:16.150 
it was okay up until I stacked them

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:18.810 
it was okay up until I stacked them
about<00:02:16.420> half<00:02:16.600> way<00:02:16.840> and<00:02:16.870> they<00:02:17.260> started<00:02:17.820> widening

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:18.820 
about half way and they started widening

00:02:18.820 --> 00:02:21.750 
about half way and they started widening
out<00:02:19.150> on<00:02:19.300> the<00:02:19.390> top<00:02:19.630> so<00:02:20.010> if<00:02:21.010> I<00:02:21.250> were<00:02:21.370> to<00:02:21.580> do<00:02:21.730> it

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:21.760 
out on the top so if I were to do it

00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:25.260 
out on the top so if I were to do it
with<00:02:22.060> 2x4<00:02:22.930> verticals<00:02:23.410> all<00:02:23.590> the<00:02:23.710> way<00:02:23.860> and<00:02:24.270> with

with 2x4 verticals all the way and with

00:02:25.270 --> 00:02:27.750 
with 2x4 verticals all the way and with
the<00:02:25.450> 45s<00:02:26.020> support<00:02:26.770> on<00:02:26.980> the<00:02:27.130> bottom<00:02:27.490> it

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:27.760 
the 45s support on the bottom it

00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:30.690 
the 45s support on the bottom it
probably<00:02:28.120> would<00:02:28.300> work<00:02:28.450> just<00:02:28.480> fine<00:02:28.900> like<00:02:29.700> you

00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:30.700 
probably would work just fine like you

00:02:30.700 --> 00:02:34.470 
probably would work just fine like you
can<00:02:30.850> see<00:02:31.060> there's<00:02:31.300> a<00:02:31.450> couple<00:02:32.280> 45<00:02:33.280> braces<00:02:34.180> there

00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:34.480 
can see there's a couple 45 braces there

00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:37.440 
can see there's a couple 45 braces there
but<00:02:35.170> if<00:02:35.260> I<00:02:35.410> did<00:02:35.590> that<00:02:35.620> all<00:02:36.010> along<00:02:36.280> you<00:02:37.210> wouldn't

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:37.450 
but if I did that all along you wouldn't

00:02:37.450 --> 00:02:39.720 
but if I did that all along you wouldn't
even<00:02:37.510> need<00:02:37.750> these<00:02:38.020> and<00:02:38.410> loading<00:02:39.250> it<00:02:39.370> would<00:02:39.580> be

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:39.730 
even need these and loading it would be

00:02:39.730 --> 00:02:41.280 
even need these and loading it would be
that<00:02:39.850> much<00:02:40.060> faster<00:02:40.330> because<00:02:40.810> then<00:02:41.050> we<00:02:41.170> could

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:41.290 
that much faster because then we could

00:02:41.290 --> 00:02:45.360 
that much faster because then we could
just<00:02:41.490> lower<00:02:42.490> it<00:02:43.530> but<00:02:44.530> loading<00:02:44.770> it<00:02:45.010> didn't<00:02:45.250> take

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:45.370 
just lower it but loading it didn't take

00:02:45.370 --> 00:02:47.250 
just lower it but loading it didn't take
me<00:02:45.520> any<00:02:45.640> time<00:02:45.910> anyway<00:02:46.360> it<00:02:46.510> was<00:02:46.630> it<00:02:46.990> was<00:02:47.110> quite

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:47.260 
me any time anyway it was it was quite

00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:49.710 
me any time anyway it was it was quite
easy<00:02:47.350> I<00:02:47.800> did<00:02:48.220> it<00:02:48.490> to<00:02:48.640> a<00:02:48.670> heights<00:02:48.970> of<00:02:49.240> it<00:02:49.360> if<00:02:49.540> I

00:02:49.710 --> 00:02:49.720 
easy I did it to a heights of it if I

00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:53.580 
easy I did it to a heights of it if I
had<00:02:50.400> to<00:02:51.400> I<00:02:51.430> could<00:02:51.670> lift<00:02:52.390> a<00:02:52.600> log<00:02:52.780> over<00:02:53.080> and<00:02:53.380> down

00:02:53.580 --> 00:02:53.590 
had to I could lift a log over and down

00:02:53.590 --> 00:03:00.990 
had to I could lift a log over and down
or<00:02:54.840> drop<00:02:55.840> it<00:02:56.020> through<00:02:59.040> what<00:03:00.040> I<00:03:00.070> did<00:03:00.160> here<00:03:00.700> is<00:03:00.730> I

00:03:00.990 --> 00:03:01.000 
or drop it through what I did here is I

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:03.600 
or drop it through what I did here is I
every<00:03:01.780> time<00:03:01.990> I<00:03:02.020> load<00:03:02.530> it<00:03:02.740> I<00:03:02.920> always<00:03:03.160> leave<00:03:03.550> the

00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:03.610 
every time I load it I always leave the

00:03:03.610 --> 00:03:07.890 
every time I load it I always leave the
bottom<00:03:04.410> log<00:03:05.410> I<00:03:05.970> leave<00:03:06.970> that<00:03:07.150> in<00:03:07.330> place<00:03:07.600> and<00:03:07.630> I

00:03:07.890 --> 00:03:07.900 
bottom log I leave that in place and I

00:03:07.900 --> 00:03:09.750 
bottom log I leave that in place and I
only<00:03:08.080> cut<00:03:08.410> to<00:03:08.620> that<00:03:08.740> that<00:03:09.070> way<00:03:09.220> I<00:03:09.250> don't<00:03:09.430> cut

00:03:09.750 --> 00:03:09.760 
only cut to that that way I don't cut

00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:12.420 
only cut to that that way I don't cut
into<00:03:10.000> the<00:03:10.090> frame<00:03:10.470> when<00:03:11.470> I'm<00:03:11.590> cutting<00:03:12.010> down<00:03:12.040> so

00:03:12.420 --> 00:03:12.430 
into the frame when I'm cutting down so

00:03:12.430 --> 00:03:15.270 
into the frame when I'm cutting down so
as<00:03:12.490> soon<00:03:12.670> as<00:03:12.790> I<00:03:12.940> see<00:03:13.090> that<00:03:13.240> bottom<00:03:13.600> log<00:03:13.810> I<00:03:14.280> leave

00:03:15.270 --> 00:03:15.280 
as soon as I see that bottom log I leave

00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:17.430 
as soon as I see that bottom log I leave
it<00:03:15.430> and<00:03:15.760> I<00:03:15.970> put<00:03:16.270> a<00:03:16.300> whole<00:03:16.480> bunch<00:03:16.690> of<00:03:16.810> braces<00:03:17.260> at

00:03:17.430 --> 00:03:17.440 
it and I put a whole bunch of braces at

00:03:17.440 --> 00:03:20.010 
it and I put a whole bunch of braces at
the<00:03:17.560> bottom<00:03:17.950> there<00:03:18.270> I'll<00:03:19.270> take<00:03:19.420> a<00:03:19.480> picture<00:03:19.780> of

00:03:20.010 --> 00:03:20.020 
the bottom there I'll take a picture of

00:03:20.020 --> 00:03:22.580 
the bottom there I'll take a picture of
it<00:03:20.140> when<00:03:20.230> it's<00:03:20.410> empty<00:03:20.620> and<00:03:20.920> post<00:03:21.160> it<00:03:21.430> to<00:03:21.610> you

00:03:22.580 --> 00:03:22.590 
it when it's empty and post it to you

00:03:22.590 --> 00:03:25.350 
it when it's empty and post it to you
but<00:03:23.590> I'm<00:03:23.890> really<00:03:24.070> happy<00:03:24.310> with<00:03:24.520> it<00:03:24.640> can<00:03:24.940> save<00:03:25.240> me

00:03:25.350 --> 00:03:25.360 
but I'm really happy with it can save me

00:03:25.360 --> 00:03:28.470 
but I'm really happy with it can save me
a<00:03:25.390> lot<00:03:25.660> of<00:03:25.690> time<00:03:26.730> so<00:03:27.730> now<00:03:27.910> I<00:03:27.940> just<00:03:28.120> have<00:03:28.330> to

00:03:28.470 --> 00:03:28.480 
a lot of time so now I just have to

00:03:28.480 --> 00:03:31.590 
a lot of time so now I just have to
bring<00:03:29.230> a<00:03:29.320> wheelbarrow<00:03:29.650> up<00:03:30.300> there<00:03:31.300> already

00:03:31.590 --> 00:03:31.600 
bring a wheelbarrow up there already

00:03:31.600 --> 00:03:40.810 
bring a wheelbarrow up there already
almost<00:03:31.930> stacked<00:03:32.440> up<00:03:32.680> in<00:03:32.860> place<00:03:33.130> right<00:03:33.370> there

00:03:40.810 --> 00:03:40.820 

00:03:40.820 --> 00:03:43.520 

so<00:03:41.820> if<00:03:41.940> anybody<00:03:42.300> thinks<00:03:42.570> of<00:03:42.630> any<00:03:42.810> improvements

00:03:43.520 --> 00:03:43.530 
so if anybody thinks of any improvements

00:03:43.530 --> 00:03:45.620 
so if anybody thinks of any improvements
on<00:03:43.650> the<00:03:43.770> design<00:03:44.130> please<00:03:44.610> feel<00:03:44.940> free<00:03:44.970> to<00:03:45.210> let<00:03:45.450> me

00:03:45.620 --> 00:03:45.630 
on the design please feel free to let me

00:03:45.630 --> 00:03:49.580 
on the design please feel free to let me
know<00:03:45.660> because<00:03:45.990> I'd<00:03:46.200> like<00:03:47.130> to<00:03:48.230> I'd<00:03:49.230> like<00:03:49.290> to

00:03:49.580 --> 00:03:49.590 
know because I'd like to I'd like to

00:03:49.590 --> 00:03:51.260 
know because I'd like to I'd like to
tweak<00:03:49.830> it<00:03:49.980> a<00:03:50.070> little<00:03:50.100> bit<00:03:50.400> but<00:03:50.580> it<00:03:50.700> is<00:03:50.880> working

00:03:51.260 --> 00:03:51.270 
tweak it a little bit but it is working

00:03:51.270 --> 00:03:54.950 
tweak it a little bit but it is working
pretty<00:03:51.540> darn<00:03:51.840> well<00:03:53.090> what<00:03:54.090> would<00:03:54.240> be<00:03:54.390> really

00:03:54.950 --> 00:03:54.960 
pretty darn well what would be really

00:03:54.960 --> 00:04:00.290 
pretty darn well what would be really
nice<00:03:55.170> is<00:03:55.410> to<00:03:55.560> build<00:03:55.800> it<00:03:55.950> with<00:03:58.250> 2x2<00:03:59.250> square<00:03:59.910> tube

00:04:00.290 --> 00:04:00.300 
nice is to build it with 2x2 square tube

00:04:00.300 --> 00:04:03.530 
nice is to build it with 2x2 square tube
aluminum<00:04:01.700> welded<00:04:02.700> aluminum<00:04:02.940> that<00:04:03.300> would<00:04:03.420> be

00:04:03.530 --> 00:04:03.540 
aluminum welded aluminum that would be

00:04:03.540 --> 00:04:07.160 
aluminum welded aluminum that would be
awesome<00:04:03.930> and<00:04:04.020> maybe<00:04:04.440> a<00:04:04.560> flip<00:04:04.920> down<00:04:05.100> side<00:04:06.170> to

00:04:07.160 --> 00:04:07.170 
awesome and maybe a flip down side to

00:04:07.170 --> 00:04:08.900 
awesome and maybe a flip down side to
take<00:04:07.380> it<00:04:07.530> apart<00:04:07.800> so<00:04:08.040> you<00:04:08.130> can<00:04:08.160> just<00:04:08.460> drop<00:04:08.670> all

00:04:08.900 --> 00:04:08.910 
take it apart so you can just drop all

00:04:08.910 --> 00:04:11.420 
take it apart so you can just drop all
the<00:04:09.030> logs<00:04:09.240> at<00:04:09.450> once<00:04:09.630> but<00:04:09.900> you<00:04:10.280> probably<00:04:11.280> won't

00:04:11.420 --> 00:04:11.430 
the logs at once but you probably won't

00:04:11.430 --> 00:04:14.210 
the logs at once but you probably won't
even<00:04:11.490> need<00:04:11.730> to<00:04:11.850> do<00:04:11.970> that<00:04:12.650> this<00:04:13.650> way<00:04:13.890> is<00:04:14.040> nice

00:04:14.210 --> 00:04:14.220 
even need to do that this way is nice

00:04:14.220 --> 00:04:15.590 
even need to do that this way is nice
because<00:04:14.460> you<00:04:14.580> just<00:04:14.760> will<00:04:14.970> your<00:04:15.120> wheel<00:04:15.270> barrel

00:04:15.590 --> 00:04:15.600 
because you just will your wheel barrel

00:04:15.600 --> 00:04:18.470 
because you just will your wheel barrel
up<00:04:15.750> to<00:04:15.930> and<00:04:16.080> load<00:04:16.290> up
