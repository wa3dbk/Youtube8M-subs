00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:15.240
 Hello everyone, I decided to hidan today 

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:18.450
 do an anime map review 

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:22.340
 robert version 1.2 

00:00:18.450 --> 00:00:23.970
 And I will say that this is asko here a mixture 

00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:27.270
 different anime 

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:29.640
 let's see first you will meet 

00:00:27.270 --> 00:00:32.090
 mod but he's only one here i'm not 

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:35.610
 I know why it was given 

00:00:32.090 --> 00:00:40.230
 here and then you have to choose 1 of 

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:42.839
 31 but the hero characters from Naruto here only 

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:45.539
 only 8 also here are two 

00:00:42.839 --> 00:00:49.739
 saske mode saske 

00:00:45.539 --> 00:00:53.449
 with mangeke sharingan om and sasuke in team 

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:56.999
 I would like to show you a knife 

00:00:53.449 --> 00:01:01.109
 At first, I would like to make you like this 

00:00:56.999 --> 00:01:04.680
 a little show on the landscape he's here 

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:09.320
 made on custom soil textures 

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:13.710
 here is a city type of something like this edition 

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:16.760
 trees but the building itself yes that is 

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:20.360
 here and here are invulnerable from where it appears 

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:22.620
 creeps it costs giant naruto 

00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:26.040
 some other village can stand 

00:01:22.620 --> 00:01:28.020
 for example ichigo of bleach and stuff like 

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:28.860
 it was done to me somehow miserable and 

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:32.400
 unclear 

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:34.290
 defensive towers too standard here 

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:37.440
 from ordinary and alliance 

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:40.290
 well, let's go to the next items 

00:01:37.440 --> 00:01:44.280
 there are behind them and the type of Anbu Mask 

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:46.710
 Sharingan shinobi dressing and well there is there 

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:49.290
 different made up there whale rings 

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:50.750
 first level creeps here too 

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:53.880
 standard form 

00:01:50.750 --> 00:01:57.010
 infantrymen and shooters on the company there 

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:58.540
 shadow clones they made us 

00:01:57.010 --> 00:02:01.090
 dorte after you use them 

00:01:58.540 --> 00:02:04.570
 there is some kind of sample ability 

00:02:01.090 --> 00:02:06.070
 home rasengan but not clones you nothing 

00:02:04.570 --> 00:02:10.600
 don't and you only 

00:02:06.070 --> 00:02:13.510
 the skill is pumped out also there is 1 m2 here 

00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:15.700
 it is correctly made one can 

00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:18.300
 return rasengan will increase your 

00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:21.750
 speed but also a good voice 

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:27.130
 part of kodomo rasengan 

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:30.580
 water well, so little rasengan too 

00:02:27.130 --> 00:02:35.110
 A good shuriken is indicated by 

00:02:30.580 --> 00:02:38.530
 lines here it appears captures 

00:02:35.110 --> 00:02:40.810
 the enemy we principle increases creating 

00:02:38.530 --> 00:02:45.960
 basically a beautiful effect 

00:02:40.810 --> 00:02:48.730
 Well, people like it here is not bad made but 

00:02:45.960 --> 00:02:52.360
 yet he has one, two, three, four 

00:02:48.730 --> 00:02:53.770
 rock in this form and we did the transition 

00:02:52.360 --> 00:02:56.230
 on and jim carry 

00:02:53.770 --> 00:02:59.380
 let's see the clip mode it does 

00:02:56.230 --> 00:03:03.489
 you or merger makes kurama and naruto 

00:02:59.380 --> 00:03:06.130
 you are given for 40 seconds this is the power 

00:03:03.489 --> 00:03:08.500
 when you do rasengan what will happen 

00:03:06.130 --> 00:03:12.310
 the explosion of which should not be some 

00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:15.070
 still racine end an explosion which is also not 

00:03:12.310 --> 00:03:19.090
 there must be vacuum rasengan let's 

00:03:15.070 --> 00:03:21.190
 let's see also a blast flying up a blast 

00:03:19.090 --> 00:03:28.750
 Well, let's develop a mini child 

00:03:21.190 --> 00:03:30.700
 appreciate that's created a red one but 

00:03:28.750 --> 00:03:33.550
 and the same effect as the difference 

00:03:30.700 --> 00:03:37.400
 river well, that's kyuubi mode 

00:03:33.550 --> 00:03:40.040
 Generally some kind of cotton I did not like 

00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:44.200
 was to mark one clone chip when he 

00:03:40.040 --> 00:03:47.450
 is created then he throws different shuriken 

00:03:44.200 --> 00:03:49.730
 who jumped one clone throws a 

00:03:47.450 --> 00:03:52.549
 the second is white 

00:03:49.730 --> 00:03:54.829
 but it still does not fix what 

00:03:52.549 --> 00:03:57.650
 the skill is done terribly because naruto doesn't 

00:03:54.829 --> 00:04:00.230
 his clone dies more precisely 

00:03:57.650 --> 00:04:04.790
 and after 5 minutes 

00:04:00.230 --> 00:04:07.909
 the tournament will begin, or rather a duel where 

00:04:04.790 --> 00:04:11.180
 fight selected players as we wrote 

00:04:07.909 --> 00:04:13.159
 in the text who will be lucky 

00:04:11.180 --> 00:04:15.379
 I especially liked the model here 

00:04:13.159 --> 00:04:17.359
 nipples you just look this look 

00:04:15.379 --> 00:04:20.870
 he pierces his soul 

00:04:17.359 --> 00:04:24.020
 then still forgot to say what the icons 

00:04:20.870 --> 00:04:29.570
 nipples standard icons and so the first 

00:04:24.020 --> 00:04:32.479
 the ability to so here it was cool 

00:04:29.570 --> 00:04:34.910
 after the fireball he flies 

00:04:32.479 --> 00:04:37.130
 noticed to fly further he 

00:04:34.910 --> 00:04:39.099
 flies to the enemy and explodes 

00:04:37.130 --> 00:04:42.169
 so how was it possible not to notice 

00:04:39.099 --> 00:04:44.389
 voice acting from the first season but to voice acting i 

00:04:42.169 --> 00:04:46.340
 In principle, I can not complain much but 

00:04:44.389 --> 00:04:48.770
 I do not really like the voice from the first 

00:04:46.340 --> 00:04:52.580
 season you where nipples from the second 

00:04:48.770 --> 00:04:54.760
 seasons next ability 4 here 4 

00:04:52.580 --> 00:04:58.220
 good too not aiming 

00:04:54.760 --> 00:04:59.260
 Beats mod voice since the second season 

00:04:58.220 --> 00:05:04.960
 all is well 

00:04:59.260 --> 00:05:04.960
 Sidorin Hasek look at indicated 

00:05:05.889 --> 00:05:11.990
 account of course sucks namutil as I 

00:05:09.320 --> 00:05:12.650
 it seems wrong to him should also be 

00:05:11.990 --> 00:05:15.320
 sasuke and 

00:05:12.650 --> 00:05:17.280
 paradise is thin and just in front let's 

00:05:15.320 --> 00:05:20.000
 let's see rayton kerry 

00:05:17.280 --> 00:05:20.000
 well news 

00:05:21.870 --> 00:05:24.350
 Stephen 

00:05:25.270 --> 00:05:33.010
 slows down bullshit beats the kirin bottle and 

00:05:30.250 --> 00:05:36.340
 sasuke becomes invulnerable while 

00:05:33.010 --> 00:05:43.540
 then from shining blue chakra now 

00:05:36.340 --> 00:05:46.590
 let's see just kirin crap this 

00:05:43.540 --> 00:05:49.300
 You can say the same Kirin just 

00:05:46.590 --> 00:05:51.100
 replaced a little effect and this is already 

00:05:49.300 --> 00:05:53.830
 not indicated by area 

00:05:51.100 --> 00:05:56.980
 as for me it was done very stupidly 

00:05:53.830 --> 00:05:59.290
 none had a serpent technique at all 

00:05:56.980 --> 00:06:03.220
 even though he owned no damn 

00:05:59.290 --> 00:06:07.660
 printing in general but then we have two 

00:06:03.220 --> 00:06:09.900
 Kirin and Sasuke out 5 skills and this 

00:06:07.660 --> 00:06:12.520
 just it seems to me unacceptable for mustache 

00:06:09.900 --> 00:06:14.860
 I call this a good card but about himself 

00:06:12.520 --> 00:06:17.950
 pretty hard present here 

00:06:14.860 --> 00:06:20.470
 non-standard landscape but all skills 

00:06:17.950 --> 00:06:22.960
 spoil but not only skills as well as 

00:06:20.470 --> 00:06:26.530
 here still creep standard them but what 

00:06:22.960 --> 00:06:29.110
 standard but here's the only thing else 

00:06:26.530 --> 00:06:31.740
 I would like to say that the card is very 

00:06:29.110 --> 00:06:35.650
 very tedious and because the buildup here 

00:06:31.740 --> 00:06:38.230
 very long very long I will put up 

00:06:35.650 --> 00:06:40.600
 score this map somewhere 4 out of 10 because 

00:06:38.230 --> 00:06:43.630
 that, in principle, so she somewhere and 

00:06:40.600 --> 00:06:44.440
 pull with you was I will give reviewers all 

00:06:43.630 --> 00:06:47.760
 have a nice day 

00:06:44.440 --> 00:06:47.760
 Thank you for watching
