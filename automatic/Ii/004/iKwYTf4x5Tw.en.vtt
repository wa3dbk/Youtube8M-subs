and<00:00:08.640> it<00:00:08.760> was<00:00:08.880> very<00:00:10.940> very<00:00:11.940> hot

00:00:23.470 --> 00:00:23.480 

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:25.720 

you<00:00:24.140> know<00:00:24.199> definitely<00:00:24.590> I<00:00:24.619> mean<00:00:24.650> I<00:00:24.800> think<00:00:24.859> when

00:00:25.720 --> 00:00:25.730 
you know definitely I mean I think when

00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:28.179 
you know definitely I mean I think when
we<00:00:25.880> looked<00:00:26.810> our<00:00:27.260> preparations<00:00:27.800> for<00:00:27.860> the<00:00:28.039> game

00:00:28.179 --> 00:00:28.189 
we looked our preparations for the game

00:00:28.189 --> 00:00:30.220 
we looked our preparations for the game
what<00:00:28.369> we<00:00:28.490> wanted<00:00:28.849> was<00:00:29.090> obviously<00:00:29.779> a<00:00:29.869> result

00:00:30.220 --> 00:00:30.230 
what we wanted was obviously a result

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:32.530 
what we wanted was obviously a result
first<00:00:30.470> and<00:00:30.710> foremost<00:00:31.039> but<00:00:31.220> a<00:00:31.540> performance

00:00:32.530 --> 00:00:32.540 
first and foremost but a performance

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:36.160 
first and foremost but a performance
where<00:00:33.910> everyone<00:00:34.910> went<00:00:35.360> away<00:00:35.510> thinking<00:00:35.989> what<00:00:36.140> a

00:00:36.160 --> 00:00:36.170 
where everyone went away thinking what a

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:37.090 
where everyone went away thinking what a
good<00:00:36.350> football<00:00:36.650> team

00:00:37.090 --> 00:00:37.100 
good football team

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:39.069 
good football team
Bournemouth<00:00:37.579> are<00:00:37.790> not<00:00:38.449> only<00:00:38.690> just<00:00:38.870> a<00:00:38.960> good

00:00:39.069 --> 00:00:39.079 
Bournemouth are not only just a good

00:00:39.079 --> 00:00:40.540 
Bournemouth are not only just a good
football<00:00:39.379> team<00:00:39.589> but<00:00:39.739> how<00:00:39.800> hard<00:00:40.040> they<00:00:40.160> work<00:00:40.339> for

00:00:40.540 --> 00:00:40.550 
football team but how hard they work for

00:00:40.550 --> 00:00:41.860 
football team but how hard they work for
each<00:00:40.610> other<00:00:40.850> and<00:00:41.030> their<00:00:41.210> mentality<00:00:41.629> is<00:00:41.839> very

00:00:41.860 --> 00:00:41.870 
each other and their mentality is very

00:00:41.870 --> 00:00:43.420 
each other and their mentality is very
good<00:00:42.260> so<00:00:42.290> that<00:00:42.589> was<00:00:42.739> our<00:00:42.860> sort<00:00:43.010> of<00:00:43.040> challenge

00:00:43.420 --> 00:00:43.430 
good so that was our sort of challenge

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:45.790 
good so that was our sort of challenge
we<00:00:43.489> set<00:00:43.730> the<00:00:43.820> players<00:00:44.030> and<00:00:44.559> hopefully<00:00:45.559> we<00:00:45.650> did

00:00:45.790 --> 00:00:45.800 
we set the players and hopefully we did

00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:46.900 
we set the players and hopefully we did
that<00:00:45.949> we<00:00:46.070> obviously<00:00:46.190> didn't<00:00:46.489> get<00:00:46.550> the<00:00:46.640> result

00:00:46.900 --> 00:00:46.910 
that we obviously didn't get the result

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:49.240 
that we obviously didn't get the result
to<00:00:47.030> match<00:00:47.150> it<00:00:47.390> but<00:00:47.629> I<00:00:48.050> don't<00:00:48.589> think<00:00:48.860> it<00:00:48.949> was<00:00:49.010> far

00:00:49.240 --> 00:00:49.250 
to match it but I don't think it was far

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:51.579 
to match it but I don't think it was far
away<00:00:49.370> if<00:00:49.780> you<00:00:50.780> know<00:00:50.900> everyone<00:00:51.199> says<00:00:51.350> goals

00:00:51.579 --> 00:00:51.589 
away if you know everyone says goals

00:00:51.589 --> 00:00:53.410 
away if you know everyone says goals
change<00:00:51.829> games<00:00:52.100> and<00:00:52.280> they<00:00:52.339> do<00:00:52.400> because<00:00:53.000> with

00:00:53.410 --> 00:00:53.420 
change games and they do because with

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:54.819 
change games and they do because with
their<00:00:53.570> first<00:00:53.780> real<00:00:54.019> attack<00:00:54.320> they've<00:00:54.589> scored

00:00:54.819 --> 00:00:54.829 
their first real attack they've scored

00:00:54.829 --> 00:00:56.740 
their first real attack they've scored
and<00:00:55.070> showed<00:00:55.250> that<00:00:55.280> that<00:00:56.059> cutting<00:00:56.420> is<00:00:56.510> that<00:00:56.660> we

00:00:56.740 --> 00:00:56.750 
and showed that that cutting is that we

00:00:56.750 --> 00:01:09.999 
and showed that that cutting is that we
didn't<00:00:58.000> unfortunately<00:00:59.000> during<00:00:59.120> the<00:00:59.270> game<00:01:09.009> we

00:01:09.999 --> 00:01:10.009 
didn't unfortunately during the game we

00:01:10.009 --> 00:01:12.580 
didn't unfortunately during the game we
don't<00:01:10.190> have<00:01:10.340> the<00:01:10.430> players<00:01:10.640> to<00:01:10.759> do<00:01:10.880> it<00:01:11.590> and

00:01:12.580 --> 00:01:12.590 
don't have the players to do it and

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:13.690 
don't have the players to do it and
that's<00:01:12.800> not<00:01:12.920> to<00:01:13.070> say<00:01:13.220> that<00:01:13.369> I<00:01:13.399> would<00:01:13.490> have<00:01:13.610> gone

00:01:13.690 --> 00:01:13.700 
that's not to say that I would have gone

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:15.130 
that's not to say that I would have gone
down<00:01:13.910> that<00:01:14.030> route<00:01:14.180> anyway<00:01:14.570> but<00:01:14.780> our<00:01:14.869> players

00:01:15.130 --> 00:01:15.140 
down that route anyway but our players

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:17.020 
down that route anyway but our players
aren't<00:01:15.380> that<00:01:15.530> way<00:01:15.710> they're<00:01:16.610> not<00:01:16.640> built<00:01:16.880> that

00:01:17.020 --> 00:01:17.030 
aren't that way they're not built that

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:21.870 
aren't that way they're not built that
way<00:01:17.179> and<00:01:17.420> we<00:01:17.570> don't<00:01:17.690> recruit<00:01:17.929> that<00:01:18.170> way<00:01:18.289> so<00:01:19.509> we

00:01:21.870 --> 00:01:21.880 
way and we don't recruit that way so we

00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:24.100 
way and we don't recruit that way so we
are<00:01:22.880> trying<00:01:23.149> to<00:01:23.179> build<00:01:23.330> a<00:01:23.479> club<00:01:23.690> here<00:01:23.869> that's

00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:24.110 
are trying to build a club here that's

00:01:25.510 --> 00:01:25.520 
built on possession very much like

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:26.910 
built on possession very much like
Liverpool<00:01:25.910> have<00:01:26.030> done<00:01:26.179> and<00:01:26.330> now<00:01:26.420> Brendan's

00:01:26.910 --> 00:01:26.920

00:01:30.249 --> 00:01:30.259 
trying to do it Liverpool and we'd very

00:01:30.259 --> 00:01:32.050 
trying to do it Liverpool and we'd very
much<00:01:30.380> want<00:01:30.649> to<00:01:30.679> go<00:01:30.770> down<00:01:30.950> that<00:01:31.099> route<00:01:31.310> so<00:01:31.610> this

00:01:32.050 --> 00:01:32.060 
much want to go down that route so this

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:33.460 
much want to go down that route so this
was<00:01:32.209> a<00:01:32.240> really<00:01:32.420> good<00:01:32.630> chance<00:01:32.869> for<00:01:32.959> us<00:01:33.110> today<00:01:33.410> to

00:01:33.460 --> 00:01:33.470 
was a really good chance for us today to

00:01:33.470 --> 00:01:36.969 
was a really good chance for us today to
try<00:01:33.860> and<00:01:34.929> go<00:01:35.929> toe-to-toe<00:01:36.140> with<00:01:36.440> a<00:01:36.590> really<00:01:36.860> good

00:01:36.969 --> 00:01:36.979 
try and go toe-to-toe with a really good

00:01:36.979 --> 00:01:38.139 
try and go toe-to-toe with a really good
football<00:01:37.190> team<00:01:37.490> one<00:01:37.670> of<00:01:37.759> the<00:01:37.819> best<00:01:37.970> in<00:01:38.090> the

00:01:38.139 --> 00:01:38.149 
football team one of the best in the

00:01:38.149 --> 00:01:40.570 
football team one of the best in the
country<00:01:38.330> and<00:01:38.630> see<00:01:39.470> if<00:01:39.560> we<00:01:39.679> could<00:01:39.890> beat<00:01:40.429> them

00:01:40.570 --> 00:01:40.580 
country and see if we could beat them

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:43.870 
country and see if we could beat them
footballing<00:01:40.940> wise<00:01:41.179> and<00:01:41.420> I<00:01:41.450> felt<00:01:42.550> first<00:01:43.550> off<00:01:43.759> we

00:01:43.870 --> 00:01:43.880 
footballing wise and I felt first off we

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:44.889 
footballing wise and I felt first off we
gave<00:01:44.000> a<00:01:44.030> really<00:01:44.239> good<00:01:44.450> account<00:01:44.750> of<00:01:44.780> ourselves

00:01:44.889 --> 00:01:44.899 
gave a really good account of ourselves

00:01:44.899 --> 00:01:46.419 
gave a really good account of ourselves
I<00:01:45.259> felt<00:01:45.470> we<00:01:45.530> were<00:01:45.619> really<00:01:45.770> unfortunate<00:01:46.310> to<00:01:46.369> be

00:01:46.419 --> 00:01:46.429 
I felt we were really unfortunate to be

00:01:46.429 --> 00:01:49.330 
I felt we were really unfortunate to be
down<00:01:46.670> a<00:01:46.700> half-time<00:01:47.239> and<00:01:47.569> on<00:01:47.929> another<00:01:48.229> day<00:01:48.349> with

00:01:49.330 --> 00:01:49.340 
down a half-time and on another day with

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:50.680 
down a half-time and on another day with
better<00:01:49.520> decision-making<00:01:49.970> around<00:01:50.300> the<00:01:50.479> box

00:01:50.680 --> 00:01:50.690 
better decision-making around the box

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:52.600 
better decision-making around the box
and<00:01:50.840> that<00:01:50.959> final<00:01:51.259> third<00:01:51.470> we<00:01:51.649> possibly<00:01:52.340> could

00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:52.610 
and that final third we possibly could

00:01:52.610 --> 00:01:58.560 
and that final third we possibly could
have<00:01:52.700> could<00:01:53.149> have<00:01:53.239> led<00:01:53.390> at<00:01:53.479> halftime

00:01:58.560 --> 00:01:58.570 

00:01:58.570 --> 00:02:00.930 

I<00:01:58.630> think<00:01:59.560> so<00:01:59.680> we<00:02:00.010> start<00:02:00.250> the<00:02:00.370> half<00:02:00.490> really<00:02:00.790> well

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:00.940 
I think so we start the half really well

00:02:00.940 --> 00:02:03.300 
I think so we start the half really well
and<00:02:01.150> then<00:02:01.320> we<00:02:02.320> went<00:02:02.440> to<00:02:02.530> no<00:02:02.770> down<00:02:02.950> I<00:02:02.979> thought

00:02:03.300 --> 00:02:03.310 
and then we went to no down I thought

00:02:03.310 --> 00:02:05.790 
and then we went to no down I thought
with<00:02:04.060> the<00:02:04.090> the<00:02:04.690> balance<00:02:04.990> of<00:02:05.110> play<00:02:05.320> at<00:02:05.650> that

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:05.800 
with the the balance of play at that

00:02:05.800 --> 00:02:07.770 
with the the balance of play at that
time<00:02:06.100> to<00:02:06.310> be<00:02:06.400> to<00:02:06.550> kneel<00:02:06.729> down<00:02:06.880> in<00:02:06.940> the<00:02:07.150> game<00:02:07.300> was

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:07.780 
time to be to kneel down in the game was

00:02:07.780 --> 00:02:10.740 
time to be to kneel down in the game was
really<00:02:07.960> hard<00:02:08.200> on<00:02:08.320> us<00:02:08.350> and<00:02:09.250> I<00:02:09.369> think<00:02:09.550> it<00:02:09.670> took<00:02:09.850> 10

00:02:10.740 --> 00:02:10.750 
really hard on us and I think it took 10

00:02:10.750 --> 00:02:13.380 
really hard on us and I think it took 10
10<00:02:11.410> minutes<00:02:11.680> really<00:02:11.830> to<00:02:12.070> stop<00:02:13.000> feeling<00:02:13.150> sorry

10 minutes really to stop feeling sorry

00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:15.690 
10 minutes really to stop feeling sorry
for<00:02:13.510> ourselves<00:02:13.660> and<00:02:14.050> then<00:02:14.170> we<00:02:14.290> we<00:02:14.890> kept<00:02:15.400> going

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:15.700 
for ourselves and then we we kept going

00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:17.790 
for ourselves and then we we kept going
we<00:02:15.790> never<00:02:15.970> gave<00:02:16.150> up<00:02:16.360> I<00:02:16.480> had<00:02:16.660> never<00:02:16.870> dropped<00:02:17.140> and

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:17.800 
we never gave up I had never dropped and

00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:19.170 
we never gave up I had never dropped and
that<00:02:17.830> really<00:02:18.130> pleases<00:02:18.310> me<00:02:18.610> that<00:02:18.760> just<00:02:18.970> said<00:02:19.090> to

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:19.180 
that really pleases me that just said to

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:20.040 
that really pleases me that just said to
the<00:02:19.240> players<00:02:19.450> at<00:02:19.540> the<00:02:19.630> end<00:02:19.720> if<00:02:19.810> we<00:02:19.840> can

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:20.050 
the players at the end if we can

00:02:20.050 --> 00:02:21.540 
the players at the end if we can
replicate<00:02:20.200> that<00:02:20.470> level<00:02:20.890> of<00:02:21.010> performance<00:02:21.220> in

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:21.550 
replicate that level of performance in

00:02:21.550 --> 00:02:23.130 
replicate that level of performance in
our<00:02:21.610> own<00:02:21.760> league<00:02:21.940> you<00:02:22.750> know<00:02:22.780> we<00:02:22.930> should<00:02:23.050> have

00:02:23.130 --> 00:02:23.140 
our own league you know we should have

00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:24.180 
our own league you know we should have
no<00:02:23.260> worries<00:02:23.530> about<00:02:23.560> what<00:02:23.830> we're<00:02:23.920> going<00:02:24.040> to<00:02:24.070> do

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:24.190 
no worries about what we're going to do

00:02:24.190 --> 00:02:30.360 
no worries about what we're going to do
this<00:02:24.340> season<00:02:29.070> definitely<00:02:30.070> I<00:02:30.100> mean<00:02:30.190> the

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:30.370 
this season definitely I mean the

00:02:30.370 --> 00:02:31.590 
this season definitely I mean the
exposure<00:02:30.700> they've<00:02:30.910> had<00:02:31.060> this<00:02:31.239> week<00:02:31.420> the

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:31.600 
exposure they've had this week the

00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:33.900 
exposure they've had this week the
chance<00:02:31.870> to<00:02:32.080> perform<00:02:32.980> in<00:02:33.220> an<00:02:33.340> international

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:33.910 
chance to perform in an international

00:02:33.910 --> 00:02:36.210 
chance to perform in an international
stage<00:02:34.120> I<00:02:34.480> think<00:02:34.739> they<00:02:35.739> didn't<00:02:35.950> let<00:02:36.070> themselves

00:02:36.210 --> 00:02:36.220 
stage I think they didn't let themselves

00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:38.100 
stage I think they didn't let themselves
down<00:02:36.550> and<00:02:36.610> I<00:02:36.820> think<00:02:37.000> big<00:02:37.510> games<00:02:37.690> like<00:02:37.870> this<00:02:37.959> can

00:02:38.100 --> 00:02:38.110 
down and I think big games like this can

00:02:38.110 --> 00:02:39.510 
down and I think big games like this can
only<00:02:38.230> build<00:02:38.470> our<00:02:38.590> mentality<00:02:38.830> remember<00:02:39.400> this

00:02:39.510 --> 00:02:39.520 
only build our mentality remember this

00:02:39.520 --> 00:02:41.280 
only build our mentality remember this
pretty<00:02:40.180> much<00:02:40.360> the<00:02:40.390> same<00:02:40.600> group<00:02:40.780> of<00:02:40.900> players<00:02:41.080> at

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:41.290 
pretty much the same group of players at

00:02:41.290 --> 00:02:43.199 
pretty much the same group of players at
planning<00:02:41.560> league<00:02:41.680> one<00:02:41.860> last<00:02:42.760> year<00:02:42.970> and<00:02:43.030> now

00:02:43.199 --> 00:02:43.209 
planning league one last year and now

00:02:43.209 --> 00:02:44.610 
planning league one last year and now
they're<00:02:43.360> exposed<00:02:43.690> regularly<00:02:44.110> to<00:02:44.260> sellouts

00:02:44.610 --> 00:02:44.620 
they're exposed regularly to sellouts

00:02:44.620 --> 00:02:47.040 
they're exposed regularly to sellouts
and<00:02:44.860> much<00:02:45.310> bigger<00:02:45.459> games<00:02:45.790> and<00:02:46.600> it's<00:02:46.750> all<00:02:46.840> part

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:47.050 
and much bigger games and it's all part

00:02:47.050 --> 00:02:48.810 
and much bigger games and it's all part
of<00:02:47.110> their<00:02:47.230> learning<00:02:47.350> curve<00:02:47.560> to<00:02:47.980> become<00:02:48.790> a

00:02:48.810 --> 00:02:48.820 
of their learning curve to become a

00:02:48.820 --> 00:02:50.280 
of their learning curve to become a
better<00:02:49.000> team<00:02:49.300> and<00:02:49.330> obviously<00:02:49.780> individually

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:50.290 
better team and obviously individually

00:02:50.290 --> 00:02:59.070 
better team and obviously individually
become<00:02:50.530> better<00:02:50.709> as<00:02:50.890> well<00:02:57.840> yeah<00:02:58.840> now<00:02:59.019> I<00:02:59.050> can

00:02:59.070 --> 00:02:59.080 
become better as well yeah now I can

00:02:59.080 --> 00:03:00.960 
become better as well yeah now I can
because<00:02:59.709> because<00:03:00.160> of<00:03:00.250> how<00:03:00.340> they<00:03:00.459> play<00:03:00.640> I<00:03:00.670> think

00:03:00.960 --> 00:03:00.970 
because because of how they play I think

00:03:00.970 --> 00:03:04.080 
because because of how they play I think
that's<00:03:01.150> a<00:03:01.269> real<00:03:01.420> strength<00:03:01.450> they've<00:03:01.989> got<00:03:03.090> our

00:03:04.080 --> 00:03:04.090 
that's a real strength they've got our

00:03:04.090 --> 00:03:05.580 
that's a real strength they've got our
standing<00:03:04.480> individuals<00:03:04.989> within<00:03:05.140> their<00:03:05.380> team

00:03:05.580 --> 00:03:05.590 
standing individuals within their team

00:03:05.590 --> 00:03:07.770 
standing individuals within their team
but<00:03:06.100> their<00:03:06.580> team<00:03:06.850> and<00:03:07.090> how<00:03:07.269> they<00:03:07.299> play<00:03:07.600> in<00:03:07.690> the

00:03:07.770 --> 00:03:07.780 
but their team and how they play in the

00:03:07.780 --> 00:03:09.090 
but their team and how they play in the
philosophy<00:03:08.230> they<00:03:08.350> follow<00:03:08.590> I<00:03:08.709> think<00:03:09.010> will

00:03:09.090 --> 00:03:09.100 
philosophy they follow I think will

00:03:09.100 --> 00:03:10.800 
philosophy they follow I think will
stand<00:03:09.280> them<00:03:09.459> in<00:03:09.549> in<00:03:10.090> good<00:03:10.269> stead<00:03:10.450> for<00:03:10.510> the<00:03:10.660> long

00:03:10.800 --> 00:03:10.810 
stand them in in good stead for the long

00:03:10.810 --> 00:03:12.900 
stand them in in good stead for the long
term<00:03:11.019> and<00:03:11.200> I<00:03:11.290> think<00:03:11.470> it's<00:03:11.590> a<00:03:11.620> mark<00:03:11.830> of<00:03:11.950> Brendan

00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:12.910 
term and I think it's a mark of Brendan

00:03:12.910 --> 00:03:14.430 
term and I think it's a mark of Brendan
as<00:03:13.090> a<00:03:13.150> manager<00:03:13.480> that<00:03:13.600> he's<00:03:13.690> brought<00:03:13.900> a<00:03:13.930> very

00:03:14.430 --> 00:03:14.440 
as a manager that he's brought a very

00:03:14.440 --> 00:03:15.960 
as a manager that he's brought a very
strong<00:03:14.769> team<00:03:14.980> down<00:03:15.190> here<00:03:15.220> today<00:03:15.610> I<00:03:15.640> think<00:03:15.880> he

00:03:15.960 --> 00:03:15.970 
strong team down here today I think he

00:03:15.970 --> 00:03:18.270 
strong team down here today I think he
knows<00:03:16.180> how<00:03:17.079> difficult<00:03:17.530> these<00:03:17.620> games<00:03:17.920> can<00:03:18.130> be

00:03:18.270 --> 00:03:18.280 
knows how difficult these games can be

00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:19.949 
knows how difficult these games can be
from<00:03:18.459> his<00:03:18.610> perspective<00:03:18.820> and<00:03:19.450> his<00:03:19.600> team<00:03:19.840> are

00:03:19.949 --> 00:03:19.959 
from his perspective and his team are

00:03:19.959 --> 00:03:26.759 
from his perspective and his team are
very<00:03:20.079> professional<00:03:25.230> yeah<00:03:26.230> I<00:03:26.290> think<00:03:26.350> so<00:03:26.650> I<00:03:26.709> mean

00:03:26.759 --> 00:03:26.769 
very professional yeah I think so I mean

00:03:26.769 --> 00:03:27.930 
very professional yeah I think so I mean
knowing<00:03:27.040> brendan<00:03:27.400> is<00:03:27.489> that<00:03:27.610> though<00:03:27.700> I<00:03:27.730> know

00:03:27.930 --> 00:03:27.940 
knowing brendan is that though I know

00:03:27.940 --> 00:03:28.710 
knowing brendan is that though I know
that<00:03:27.970> you<00:03:28.209> would<00:03:28.299> have<00:03:28.360> done<00:03:28.450> his<00:03:28.600> homework

00:03:28.710 --> 00:03:28.720 
that you would have done his homework

00:03:28.720 --> 00:03:32.160 
that you would have done his homework
intrested<00:03:29.380> have<00:03:29.500> watched<00:03:29.680> us<00:03:29.890> and<00:03:30.160> I<00:03:30.220> think<00:03:31.170> he

00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:32.170 
intrested have watched us and I think he

00:03:32.170 --> 00:03:34.110 
intrested have watched us and I think he
looking<00:03:32.980> at<00:03:33.070> our<00:03:33.130> recent<00:03:33.280> performances<00:03:33.910> he

00:03:34.110 --> 00:03:34.120 
looking at our recent performances he

00:03:34.120 --> 00:03:34.979 
looking at our recent performances he
would<00:03:34.239> have<00:03:34.360> thought<00:03:34.480> he's<00:03:34.660> going<00:03:34.750> to<00:03:34.840> be<00:03:34.930> in

00:03:34.979 --> 00:03:34.989 
would have thought he's going to be in

00:03:34.989 --> 00:03:36.180 
would have thought he's going to be in
for<00:03:35.110> a<00:03:35.170> tough<00:03:35.320> game<00:03:35.500> and<00:03:35.560> that's<00:03:35.860> why<00:03:36.010> he's

00:03:36.180 --> 00:03:36.190 
for a tough game and that's why he's

00:03:36.190 --> 00:03:38.280 
for a tough game and that's why he's
picked<00:03:36.370> a<00:03:36.430> team<00:03:36.610> that<00:03:36.760> he<00:03:36.820> has<00:03:36.940> and<00:03:37.290> ultimately

00:03:38.280 --> 00:03:38.290 
picked a team that he has and ultimately

00:03:38.290 --> 00:03:40.560 
picked a team that he has and ultimately
that<00:03:38.410> quality<00:03:39.000> in<00:03:40.000> the<00:03:40.150> front<00:03:40.329> areas

00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:40.570 
that quality in the front areas

00:03:40.570 --> 00:03:41.789 
that quality in the front areas
especially<00:03:40.720> it<00:03:41.110> has<00:03:41.320> been<00:03:41.470> a<00:03:41.500> difference

00:03:41.789 --> 00:03:41.799 
especially it has been a difference

00:03:41.799 --> 00:03:42.650 
especially it has been a difference
between<00:03:41.890> the<00:03:42.130> two<00:03:42.250> teams

00:03:42.650 --> 00:03:42.660 
between the two teams

00:03:42.660 --> 00:03:45.420 
between the two teams
so<00:03:43.660> we<00:03:44.019> take<00:03:44.380> that<00:03:44.500> as<00:03:44.650> a<00:03:44.680> compliment<00:03:45.160> but<00:03:45.280> we

00:03:45.420 --> 00:03:45.430 
so we take that as a compliment but we

00:03:45.430 --> 00:03:47.130 
so we take that as a compliment but we
if<00:03:46.120> we<00:03:46.239> were<00:03:46.329> to<00:03:46.450> win<00:03:46.540> today<00:03:46.780> we<00:03:46.900> wanted<00:03:47.049> to

00:03:47.130 --> 00:03:47.140 
if we were to win today we wanted to

00:03:47.140 --> 00:03:48.810 
if we were to win today we wanted to
