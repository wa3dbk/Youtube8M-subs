00:00:45.070 --> 00:00:45.080 
safety features that we built into this

00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:49.119 
safety features that we built into this
machine<00:00:45.640> so<00:00:46.640> starting<00:00:47.629> you've<00:00:48.559> walk<00:00:48.800> up<00:00:49.010> to

machine so starting you've walk up to

00:00:49.129 --> 00:00:50.229 
machine so starting you've walk up to
the<00:00:49.190> machine<00:00:49.520> again<00:00:49.790> this<00:00:49.940> is<00:00:50.120> our

00:00:50.229 --> 00:00:50.239 
the machine again this is our

00:00:50.239 --> 00:00:52.210 
the machine again this is our
accessorized<00:00:50.900> unit<00:00:51.290> but<00:00:51.710> you<00:00:51.770> can<00:00:51.980> see

00:00:52.210 --> 00:00:52.220 
accessorized unit but you can see

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:55.840 
accessorized unit but you can see
there's<00:00:52.460> a<00:00:52.520> nice<00:00:53.200> big<00:00:54.200> roll<00:00:54.470> cage<00:00:54.770> then<00:00:55.610> roll

00:00:55.840 --> 00:00:55.850 
there's a nice big roll cage then roll

00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:58.540 
there's a nice big roll cage then roll
cage<00:00:56.120> itself<00:00:56.660> is<00:00:56.989> is<00:00:57.230> not<00:00:57.770> only<00:00:57.950> aesthetically

00:00:58.540 --> 00:00:58.550 
cage itself is is not only aesthetically

00:00:58.550 --> 00:01:00.400 
cage itself is is not only aesthetically
pleasing<00:00:58.670> but<00:00:59.540> we<00:00:59.660> built<00:00:59.900> a<00:01:00.080> lot<00:01:00.260> of

00:01:00.400 --> 00:01:00.410 
pleasing but we built a lot of

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:03.490 
pleasing but we built a lot of
functionality<00:01:00.920> into<00:01:01.309> this<00:01:01.580> cage<00:01:01.850> 1st<00:01:02.840> two

00:01:03.490 --> 00:01:03.500

that<00:01:06.710> means<00:01:06.950> is<00:01:07.160> we<00:01:07.280> have<00:01:07.400> the<00:01:07.520> largest

00:01:07.870 --> 00:01:07.880 
that means is we have the largest

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:11.350 
that means is we have the largest
diameter<00:01:08.410> roll<00:01:09.410> cage<00:01:09.680> in<00:01:09.890> the<00:01:10.130> industry<00:01:10.610> many

put<00:01:14.119> a<00:01:14.149> lot<00:01:14.390> of<00:01:14.420> design<00:01:15.080> in<00:01:15.110> the<00:01:15.380> welds<00:01:15.950> and

00:01:16.060 --> 00:01:16.070 
put a lot of design in the welds and

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:18.100 
put a lot of design in the welds and
everything<00:01:16.640> reinforcement<00:01:17.540> points<00:01:17.899> all<00:01:18.050> over

00:01:18.100 --> 00:01:18.110 
everything reinforcement points all over

Keith the grey key is just a standard

00:04:15.949 --> 00:04:18.550 
Keith the grey key is just a standard
key<00:04:16.190> it<00:04:16.430> limits<00:04:17.209> speed<00:04:17.510> the<00:04:17.690> 40<00:04:18.049> miles<00:04:18.260> an<00:04:18.470> hour

00:04:18.550 --> 00:04:18.560 
key it limits speed the 40 miles an hour

00:04:18.560 --> 00:04:21.520 
key it limits speed the 40 miles an hour
so<00:04:19.549> that's<00:04:19.909> that's<00:04:20.269> a<00:04:20.449> nice<00:04:20.659> feature<00:04:20.959> that<00:04:21.169> our

00:04:21.520 --> 00:04:21.530 
so that's that's a nice feature that our

00:04:21.530 --> 00:04:23.740 
so that's that's a nice feature that our
intelligent<00:04:22.490> throttle<00:04:22.880> control<00:04:23.210> allows<00:04:23.479> us

00:04:23.740 --> 00:04:23.750 
intelligent throttle control allows us

00:04:23.750 --> 00:04:26.529 
intelligent throttle control allows us
to<00:04:23.930> have<00:04:24.110> also<00:04:25.070> there's<00:04:25.639> a<00:04:25.729> black<00:04:26.000> Keith<00:04:26.270> this

00:04:26.529 --> 00:04:26.539 
to have also there's a black Keith this

00:04:26.539 --> 00:04:27.909 
to have also there's a black Keith this
black<00:04:26.780> key<00:04:27.050> is<00:04:27.110> what<00:04:27.500> we<00:04:27.590> call<00:04:27.770> the

00:04:27.909 --> 00:04:27.919 
black key is what we call the

00:04:27.919 --> 00:04:30.339 
black key is what we call the
performance<00:04:28.490> key<00:04:28.699> so<00:04:29.300> basically<00:04:29.720> you<00:04:29.990> can<00:04:30.169> go

00:04:30.339 --> 00:04:30.349 
performance key so basically you can go

00:04:30.349 --> 00:04:32.740 
performance key so basically you can go
out<00:04:30.530> you<00:04:30.860> have<00:04:30.979> a<00:04:31.010> limited<00:04:31.460> speed<00:04:31.789> unlimited

00:04:32.740 --> 00:04:32.750 
out you have a limited speed unlimited

00:04:32.750 --> 00:04:34.510 
out you have a limited speed unlimited
power<00:04:32.780> so<00:04:33.320> it's<00:04:33.500> a<00:04:33.560> nice<00:04:33.770> feature<00:04:34.130> that

00:04:34.510 --> 00:04:34.520 
power so it's a nice feature that

00:04:34.520 --> 00:04:37.120 
power so it's a nice feature that
intelligent<00:04:35.360> throttle<00:04:35.690> control<00:04:36.080> allows<00:04:36.830> us

00:04:37.120 --> 00:04:37.130 
intelligent throttle control allows us

00:04:37.130 --> 00:04:39.700 
intelligent throttle control allows us
to<00:04:37.310> bring<00:04:37.610> a<00:04:38.210> little<00:04:38.720> feature<00:04:38.990> like<00:04:39.289> that<00:04:39.500> to

00:04:39.700 --> 00:04:39.710 
to bring a little feature like that to

00:04:39.710 --> 00:04:42.730 
to bring a little feature like that to
this<00:04:39.860> machine<00:04:40.070> and<00:04:40.460> as<00:04:41.180> an<00:04:41.449> accessory<00:04:41.780> we<00:04:42.590> have

00:04:42.730 --> 00:04:42.740 
this machine and as an accessory we have

00:04:42.740 --> 00:04:45.100 
this machine and as an accessory we have
an<00:04:42.860> orange<00:04:43.400> kind<00:04:43.909> of<00:04:44.030> a<00:04:44.120> worksite<00:04:44.690> key<00:04:44.960> if<00:04:45.080> you

00:04:45.100 --> 00:04:45.110 
an orange kind of a worksite key if you

00:04:45.110 --> 00:04:48.159 
an orange kind of a worksite key if you
will<00:04:45.260> that<00:04:45.650> key<00:04:46.610> limits<00:04:47.000> the<00:04:47.180> speed<00:04:47.449> to<00:04:47.690> 25

00:04:48.159 --> 00:04:48.169 
will that key limits the speed to 25

00:04:48.169 --> 00:04:51.189 
will that key limits the speed to 25
miles<00:04:48.440> an<00:04:48.590> hour<00:04:48.710> it's<00:04:49.310> perfect<00:04:49.880> for<00:04:49.970> job<00:04:50.810> sites
