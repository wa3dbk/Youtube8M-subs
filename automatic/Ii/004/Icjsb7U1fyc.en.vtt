then I'm wearing white pearls from

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:32.990

forever 21 I have like some rose and

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:34.639 
forever 21 I have like some rose and
like<00:00:33.090> gold<00:00:33.390> eyeshadow<00:00:33.630> on<00:00:34.170> but<00:00:34.380> it's<00:00:34.500> very

00:00:34.639 --> 00:00:34.649 
like gold eyeshadow on but it's very

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:39.500 
like gold eyeshadow on but it's very
subtle<00:00:35.010> so<00:00:35.780> because<00:00:36.780> I<00:00:36.870> googled<00:00:37.290> like<00:00:38.510> makeup

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:39.510 
subtle so because I googled like makeup

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:40.880 
subtle so because I googled like makeup
that<00:00:39.719> looks<00:00:39.780> good<00:00:40.170> in<00:00:40.260> fluorescent<00:00:40.739> lighting

00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:40.890 
that looks good in fluorescent lighting

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:42.740 
that looks good in fluorescent lighting
because<00:00:41.340> I<00:00:41.489> always<00:00:41.730> find<00:00:41.969> that<00:00:42.149> fluorescent

00:00:42.740 --> 00:00:42.750 
because I always find that fluorescent

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:44.270 
because I always find that fluorescent
lighting<00:00:42.899> is<00:00:43.050> really<00:00:43.200> unflattering<00:00:43.559> so<00:00:44.100> I

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:44.280 
lighting is really unflattering so I

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:45.799 
lighting is really unflattering so I
will<00:00:44.640> be<00:00:44.760> doing<00:00:44.910> it<00:00:45.059> tutorial<00:00:45.420> on<00:00:45.480> that<00:00:45.570> and
