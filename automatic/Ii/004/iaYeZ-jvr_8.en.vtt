00:00:10.150 --> 00:00:14.570
 I'll show you the hat trick today 

00:00:12.620 --> 00:00:18.770
 yes he has already seen him this is precisely 

00:00:14.570 --> 00:00:24.650
 a combination of the kick and the 

00:00:18.770 --> 00:00:26.750
 Transporter with her should be so 

00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:29.630
 the kickflip can be good because he 

00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:31.509
 comes in the daily for one stop shop 

00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:34.370
 do not have to be so tight now 

00:00:31.509 --> 00:00:36.440
 I would have to specialize but know 

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:39.710
 You should pop the workshop with it 

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:43.190
 why can that strengthen the scenic 

00:00:39.710 --> 00:00:44.930
 because the hard looks so and the 

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:52.550
 is similar remember is already several website 

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:54.770
 pop as in front side pockets and yes that 

00:00:52.550 --> 00:00:57.890
 is already after the actual 

00:00:54.770 --> 00:01:03.410
 mountain time with it but you make her 

00:00:57.890 --> 00:01:07.269
 not so to sides but to measure in the 

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:07.269
 middle pure so press through here 

00:01:08.500 --> 00:01:15.340
 lift it and then you have to 

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:18.920
 if you like this hans barth and that 

00:01:15.340 --> 00:01:20.209
 tries to push in here 

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:21.650
 here you put your finger like this 

00:01:20.209 --> 00:01:25.520
 bit of it 

00:01:21.650 --> 00:01:28.790
 and then that turns in the middle so that 

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:32.540
 the graphic is showing under not seen 

00:01:28.790 --> 00:01:33.710
 The hna trip is not one of the 

00:01:32.540 --> 00:01:37.130
 The most difficult tricks I would say 

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:39.530
 but he is still relative 

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:43.670
 difficult the position should be 

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:47.120
 be so because they just because in the 

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:51.620
 front finger with so hard there is that 

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:53.360
 problem does not try you then gets 

00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:56.440
 Do not miss this one 

00:01:53.360 --> 00:01:59.930
 bit and 17 makes him the same 

00:01:56.440 --> 00:02:01.640
 It just does not work that way 

00:01:59.930 --> 00:02:06.710
 makes the fingers a bit further 

00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:08.929
 both the screws start and yes me 

00:02:06.710 --> 00:02:14.420
 Maybe this should kick kick 

00:02:08.929 --> 00:02:16.700
 on a palette can 

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:21.099
 At the end of the day, there is also a hard time about it 

00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:21.099
 try and maybe exactly 

00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:27.950
 create over it 

00:02:24.770 --> 00:02:34.220
 that should be able to do the trick of 

00:02:27.950 --> 00:02:37.610
 Making a box under so beneficial 

00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:40.340
 because that's harder and harder 

00:02:37.610 --> 00:02:41.900
 that's why you can not do that 

00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:44.150
 do later if you like the lions 

00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:46.850
 entangled in kicking but now for the first time 

00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:49.489
 bring us that we do not but you 

00:02:46.850 --> 00:02:54.890
 can definitely kick flip ye 

00:02:49.489 --> 00:02:56.840
 especially on a sorry 

00:02:54.890 --> 00:03:03.440
 a buck on it or so you can 

00:02:56.840 --> 00:03:06.280
 the leashes are just practicing on a box 

00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:11.269
 out and then down six laptops 

00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:13.160
 I should have worked 

00:03:11.269 --> 00:03:19.220
 can not now always good that can 

00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:23.560
 her while practicing so then I would 

00:03:19.220 --> 00:03:23.560
 say that's it and yes
