00:00:00.740 --> 00:00:08.630
 we do not have this 800 lumia you can also 

00:00:05.029 --> 00:00:11.509
 do with line 520 and any phone 

00:00:08.630 --> 00:00:13.400
 have the sensor proximity sensor 

00:00:11.509 --> 00:00:16.070
 of proximity is the one that is here in the 

00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:18.349
 top part near the headset and it's 

00:00:16.070 --> 00:00:20.289
 the one who serves that when we do 

00:00:18.349 --> 00:00:23.949
 a call 

00:00:20.289 --> 00:00:25.929
 the phone goes into energy savings or 

00:00:23.949 --> 00:00:28.419
 what the screen so that when I do not 

00:00:25.929 --> 00:00:30.969
 we do to our ear do not oppress 

00:00:28.419 --> 00:00:32.769
 no key unintentionally results 

00:00:30.969 --> 00:00:34.540
 that these phones when we change them 

00:00:32.769 --> 00:00:36.040
 the display may be left with this fault 

00:00:34.540 --> 00:00:38.769
 let's learn here a trick for 

00:00:36.040 --> 00:00:41.199
 able to solve it when the problem 

00:00:38.769 --> 00:00:43.449
 is in the proximity sensor happens 

00:00:41.199 --> 00:00:46.000
 this when calling on any phone 

00:00:43.449 --> 00:00:47.979
 have this same system we are not going to 

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:50.229
 be able to do what you do without 

00:00:47.979 --> 00:00:52.420
 take it to our ear and we will want 

00:00:50.229 --> 00:00:54.400
 press any key we want it 

00:00:52.420 --> 00:00:57.040
 unlock or enter the menu and we're not going 

00:00:54.400 --> 00:00:59.350
 to be able this is because the sensor of 

00:00:57.040 --> 00:01:02.409
 proximity has a problem either 

00:00:59.350 --> 00:01:05.229
 because the same sensor is that something 

00:01:02.409 --> 00:01:07.810
 be here is covering the visibility or 

00:01:05.229 --> 00:01:10.850
 that it is not enough to focus, we are going to 

00:01:07.810 --> 00:01:13.100
 look how we solve that lack 

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:15.229
 since we see then it is already armed 

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:17.210
 display and I want to show you here is the 

00:01:15.229 --> 00:01:19.880
 sensor in this case this is the sensor 

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:21.700
 proximity is that we want here I'm going to 

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:25.220
 focus here so you can see it 

00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:26.840
 these are the lenses that tell 

00:01:25.220 --> 00:01:29.360
 processor or the circuit that is 

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:31.280
 administering that function that what 

00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:33.640
 we have our ear near or what there is 

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:37.970
 some obstacle there why when 

00:01:33.640 --> 00:01:41.000
 they also place a protector or an anti 

00:01:37.970 --> 00:01:42.920
 spy that covers the visibility he's going to 

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:45.800
 have that flaw and we can not have 

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:48.810
 no sticker or anything that covers this 

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:51.180
 hole that we see here 

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:53.549
 which is the one destined for the sensor 

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:56.970
 proximity in this case we will be able to 

00:01:53.549 --> 00:02:00.380
 solve it because it turns out that as the 

00:01:56.970 --> 00:02:03.860
 pasta that brings the display 

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:06.800
 in this case it is because when it is 

00:02:03.860 --> 00:02:10.430
 the paste that the display brings 

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:13.280
 and the pasta has a very thick edge the 

00:02:10.430 --> 00:02:16.640
 edge that we see here is very thick and I 

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:19.850
 Remove the lens proximity sensor 

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:22.010
 or how the tows approach 

00:02:19.850 --> 00:02:24.080
 let's solve that very easy fault 

00:02:22.010 --> 00:02:26.660
 let's remove the sensor from there the 

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:28.780
 sensor that is removed can take it out 

00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:32.500
 from here in the back 

00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:35.430
 and we're going to grab it with a sandpaper and we're going to 

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:38.609
 wear this edge that what 

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:42.620
 that is quite reduced so that 

00:02:38.609 --> 00:02:45.780
 when the screen is on it do 

00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:48.900
 better contact or so to speak 

00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:50.230
 closer to the glass I used the motor 

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:53.299
 tool 

00:02:50.230 --> 00:02:54.569
 worn this area and now we are going to 

00:02:53.299 --> 00:02:57.180
 see what 

00:02:54.569 --> 00:02:59.790
 I will be able to give a solution this can be 

00:02:57.180 --> 00:03:02.639
 due to several factors that you do not do 

00:02:59.790 --> 00:03:04.170
 be close to the lens sensor or 

00:03:02.639 --> 00:03:08.680
 viewer 

00:03:04.170 --> 00:03:14.060
 that this was what we found this mistreated 

00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:16.670
 we have caused some damage and the other 

00:03:14.060 --> 00:03:17.660
 that there is some obstacle that you do not leave 

00:03:16.670 --> 00:03:21.580
 what 

00:03:17.660 --> 00:03:21.580
 that the sensor has good visibility 

00:03:22.410 --> 00:03:27.110
 and here we see then after having 

00:03:24.750 --> 00:03:27.110
 fact 

00:03:27.510 --> 00:03:32.310
 after right the little job to the 

00:03:29.459 --> 00:03:34.170
 happens so that the sensor will be more 

00:03:32.310 --> 00:03:36.329
 near there we see that it is already working 

00:03:34.170 --> 00:03:38.459
 here squeezing them because I'm missing the 

00:03:36.329 --> 00:03:40.500
 screw but first not even squeezing it 

00:03:38.459 --> 00:03:43.500
 will enable the keys here I can already 

00:03:40.500 --> 00:03:45.390
 cut calls enter the menu and 

00:03:43.500 --> 00:03:47.849
 to be able to do anything else in 

00:03:45.390 --> 00:03:50.909
 calls that I could not do 

00:03:47.849 --> 00:03:52.920
 previously there we see then how 

00:03:50.909 --> 00:03:55.079
 we can give solution to any failure 

00:03:52.920 --> 00:03:56.609
 of this lumia or any phone that 

00:03:55.079 --> 00:03:59.430
 have problems that when we do 

00:03:56.609 --> 00:04:01.230
 calls the black screen is put if 

00:03:59.430 --> 00:04:04.739
 What we want to learn is how to change 

00:04:01.230 --> 00:04:06.480
 the display or how to remove the tablet that 

00:04:04.739 --> 00:04:08.040
 is in a video earlier in
