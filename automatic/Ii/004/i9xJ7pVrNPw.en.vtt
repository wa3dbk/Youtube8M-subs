00:00:00.089 --> 00:00:06.540
 de simone and casto mar then today 

00:00:03.239 --> 00:00:08.670
 we'll talk about the blues scale played 

00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:11.599
 in second position 

00:00:08.670 --> 00:00:17.340
 we speak of second position when 

00:00:11.599 --> 00:00:20.490
 we play the semi- tones with a harmonic itself 

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:22.110
 more than the companion there is no piece 

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:23.640
 that we must accompany the shade 

00:00:22.110 --> 00:00:26.820
 we are accompanied by brive 

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:29.789
 so if the blues we need 

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:33.480
 accompanying alone we will count 6 

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:36.600
 semitones more than the note of the 

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:38.340
 tonality of the song to get yours 

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:42.110
 harmonic life to use then in 

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:42.110
 this case said the soul was good 

00:00:43.579 --> 00:00:53.600
 12345 s harmonica in lo are not other 

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:59.149
 example if the song is a goal in mini 

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:59.149
 classic businnes condono 6 semitones 

00:00:59.780 --> 00:01:07.139
 123456 for us that we must use e 

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:10.679
 the harmonica and this this way of 

00:01:07.139 --> 00:01:13.229
 make it sound if you add more than 

00:01:10.679 --> 00:01:15.630
 the tone of the accompaniment is called 

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:17.249
 second this second said position 

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:23.189
 also homeless 

00:01:17.249 --> 00:01:26.520
 so now I show that head 

00:01:23.189 --> 00:01:29.999
 I wrote we say by summary a 

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:32.459
 let's say the tone of the piano with 

00:01:29.999 --> 00:01:33.869
 the harmonica to use in this case 

00:01:32.459 --> 00:01:36.869
 so if the song in sol 

00:01:33.869 --> 00:01:41.340
 but monica I wanted to go up and harmonic e 

00:01:36.869 --> 00:01:45.299
 the harmonix and the song la the harmonica 

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:45.779
 r I was seeing if you could see that and so 

00:01:45.299 --> 00:01:48.490
 Street 

00:01:45.779 --> 00:01:51.440
 if the good 

00:01:48.490 --> 00:01:53.810
 the harmonica must be used and is flat 

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:55.850
 they sounded second second position 

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:59.210
 position 

00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:59.890
 now I will take away the scale 

00:01:59.210 --> 00:02:01.760
 blues 

00:01:59.890 --> 00:02:05.900
 let us take a harmonic with references 

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:08.030
 indoor de simone vast marta so I have 

00:02:05.900 --> 00:02:14.890
 got the harmonica in do the song I'm in 

00:02:08.030 --> 00:02:14.890
 then accompanying and a soul businnes 

00:02:21.460 --> 00:02:25.000
 blues scale 

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:28.640
 in short, we are accompanying a 

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:31.550
 reviewer with our harmonic endo i 

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:35.540
 these are the holes we need to play 

00:02:31.550 --> 00:02:38.900
 the second aspirate then above is the 

00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:42.620
 blown notes and under the aspirated notes 

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:43.220
 as has therefore under we have the second has 

00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:45.650
 expired 

00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:49.130
 the third aspect aspirated bent of a 

00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:51.230
 semitone marinetta alone the fourth 

00:02:49.130 --> 00:02:57.560
 blown the fourth aspirate of a 

00:02:51.230 --> 00:03:01.390
 semitono the fourth aspirated the quindo 

00:02:57.560 --> 00:03:03.950
 aspirated so let's do these 

00:03:01.390 --> 00:03:05.570
 these notes then I wrote year in 

00:03:03.950 --> 00:03:08.739
 correspondence in the minutes I am in 

00:03:05.570 --> 00:03:08.739
 based on the outside sounding 

00:03:13.750 --> 00:03:18.830
 and this we say is our blues scale 

00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:24.220
 now I'll show you the scheme too 

00:03:18.830 --> 00:03:24.220
 of a kindle harmonica 

00:03:25.720 --> 00:03:43.310
 here it is then second aspirated 

00:03:39.620 --> 00:03:47.240
 we have only in the third aspirate of a 

00:03:43.310 --> 00:03:49.280
 semitone we have B flat the fourth 

00:03:47.240 --> 00:03:55.180
 blown we have the fourth dawn 

00:03:49.280 --> 00:03:59.150
 aspirated by a semitone and the D flat king 

00:03:55.180 --> 00:04:00.890
 fourth aspirate ray and then aspirated e 

00:03:59.150 --> 00:04:02.930
 ago and then it happened but to close with the 

00:04:00.890 --> 00:04:05.980
 We usually have it on blown sex 

00:04:02.930 --> 00:04:05.980
 face to listen 

00:04:16.660 --> 00:04:20.950
 I make it slower 

00:04:49.340 --> 00:04:57.020
 ok so this is the scale of urso born 

00:04:54.450 --> 00:04:57.020
 in second position 

00:04:57.660 --> 00:05:03.840
 so now if we don't know we have to 

00:05:00.470 --> 00:05:08.340
 accompany a song a classic blues 

00:05:03.840 --> 00:05:12.390
 the mini the harmonica we have to use 

00:05:08.340 --> 00:05:15.660
 this scheme a classic blues song 

00:05:12.390 --> 00:05:20.550
 and I want to use the app so let's take 

00:05:15.660 --> 00:05:22.080
 harmonica in there with the here the useless i 

00:05:20.550 --> 00:05:22.770
 The holes we need to make are always the 

00:05:22.080 --> 00:05:25.260
 themselves 

00:05:22.770 --> 00:05:27.180
 looks like the second aspirated third 

00:05:25.260 --> 00:05:29.190
 beach a continuation in the blown quarter 

00:05:27.180 --> 00:05:30.510
 and fourth aspirate of a fourth servant 

00:05:29.190 --> 00:05:32.370
 aspirated 

00:05:30.510 --> 00:05:33.930
 therefore he explained however logically and 

00:05:32.370 --> 00:05:42.950
 changing harmonics also change 

00:05:33.930 --> 00:05:42.950
 note I also did an armor in there 

00:05:44.150 --> 00:05:52.550
 this monica hill 

00:05:47.210 --> 00:05:52.550
 so if we dream the scale now 

00:05:52.910 --> 00:05:58.680
 ours out to get the logically 

00:05:56.130 --> 00:06:03.090
 scale bluse and my name is using a harmonica 

00:05:58.680 --> 00:06:06.330
 in here we remember the good we are 

00:06:03.090 --> 00:06:08.430
 accompanying is in me we have done the 

00:06:06.330 --> 00:06:10.590
 calculation of 66 million more then 

00:06:08.430 --> 00:06:13.940
 we got to use we understand 

00:06:10.590 --> 00:06:13.940
 that a harmonica is used and the 

00:06:22.430 --> 00:06:27.300
 so in this case, however, the notes that 

00:06:25.230 --> 00:06:29.250
 we played we take the pattern 

00:06:27.300 --> 00:06:31.980
 of the harmonica we are going to see that 

00:06:29.250 --> 00:06:36.300
 the second aspirated and in fact equal dogs 

00:06:31.980 --> 00:06:38.720
 from where part would be athlete of the song 

00:06:36.300 --> 00:06:44.660
 which I am accompanied in the second show 

00:06:38.720 --> 00:06:48.930
 the third aspirate of a parent a sol 

00:06:44.660 --> 00:06:52.890
 the fourth forced and the fourth 

00:06:48.930 --> 00:06:55.950
 aspirate of a sequel is not B-flat 

00:06:52.890 --> 00:07:01.520
 then we have the fourth looks spied on that 

00:06:55.950 --> 00:07:05.420
 it is the fifth that tends to expire this way 

00:07:01.520 --> 00:07:07.830
 simply changing harmonica doing 

00:07:05.420 --> 00:07:10.260
 always the same sequence of out 

00:07:07.830 --> 00:07:12.990
 we always blow in the same 

00:07:10.260 --> 00:07:16.050
 sequence of then we got the 

00:07:12.990 --> 00:07:24.770
 our scale bluse in with the harmonica e 

00:07:16.050 --> 00:07:27.750
 The I do not know this is all this 

00:07:24.770 --> 00:07:31.260
 this is the blue scale playing in the second 

00:07:27.750 --> 00:07:35.540
 position with sharp the more we will see it 

00:07:31.260 --> 00:07:35.540
 first position and third position
