don't<00:01:26.700> need<00:01:26.850> it<00:01:26.909> because<00:01:27.060> you<00:01:27.180> need<00:01:27.330> to<00:01:27.420> summon

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:27.600 
don't need it because you need to summon

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:29.090 
don't need it because you need to summon
other<00:01:27.810> monsters<00:01:28.290> rather<00:01:28.710> than<00:01:28.920> just

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:29.100 
other monsters rather than just

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:31.010 
other monsters rather than just
summoning<00:01:29.400> a<00:01:29.460> monster<00:01:29.490> and<00:01:29.880> milling<00:01:30.150> to<00:01:30.689> level

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:31.020

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:35.719 
leaders to malicious one plague one gale
he's<00:01:34.350> just<00:01:34.470> a<00:01:34.650> gale<00:01:34.920> is<00:01:35.040> just<00:01:35.189> a<00:01:35.280> good<00:01:35.460> out<00:01:35.579> to

00:01:35.719 --> 00:01:35.729 
he's just a gale is just a good out to

he's just a gale is just a good out to
xi'an<00:01:36.000> pretty<00:01:36.479> much<00:01:36.659> that's<00:01:36.869> really<00:01:37.200> the<00:01:37.290> only

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:37.320 
xi'an pretty much that's really the only

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:38.510 
xi'an pretty much that's really the only
reason<00:01:37.619> why<00:01:37.710> even<00:01:37.979> though<00:01:38.040> she<00:01:38.130> and<00:01:38.340> you're

to effectively there's one morphing jar
I<00:01:59.100> like<00:01:59.549> it<00:01:59.700> when<00:01:59.759> you<00:01:59.850> draw<00:02:00.030> those<00:02:00.210> really

00:02:39.230 --> 00:02:39.240 
the space one cai i guess you can drop

00:02:39.240 --> 00:02:40.610 
the space one cai i guess you can drop
the<00:02:39.300> clients<00:02:39.750> actually<00:02:39.900> for<00:02:40.200> a<00:02:40.230> second<00:02:40.530> source

00:02:40.610 --> 00:02:40.620
