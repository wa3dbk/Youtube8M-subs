00:00:06.319 --> 00:00:12.509
 very good everyone will know where there's 

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:14.340
 As you all know organic matter is 

00:00:12.509 --> 00:00:17.340
 key to the development of our 

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:20.039
 plants and the easiest ecological way and 

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:23.189
 economic to get it is to make a 

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:26.730
 compostera now if you are not very handy 

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:29.010
 as I offer you a shabby way but 

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:31.560
 very effective to get yours 

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:34.140
 organic matter me for me compostera 

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:37.710
 I have just used four pallets 

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:40.200
 lined with garbage bags now for 

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:44.010
 fill it we need so much dry residue 

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:44.610
 as wet residue and or for the residue 

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:46.320
 dry 

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:49.379
 I have been stacking the weeds of 

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:51.510
 orchard and letting it dry for the wet 

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:53.780
 basically use the pruning remains 

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:57.390
 or the plants that are no longer productive 

00:00:53.780 --> 00:00:59.579
 these remains the picas well of good and 

00:00:57.390 --> 00:01:01.680
 you are piling layers of dry waste 

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:04.140
 over layers of wet residue as if 

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:06.119
 outside a sandwich once you have the 

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:06.900
 mounted composter should be lent 

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:10.110
 special 

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:12.150
 to the kinetics of composting if the pile 

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:16.230
 of composting does not reach a temperature 

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:18.930
 enough the compost will not be stable nor 

00:01:16.230 --> 00:01:21.180
 hygienic so I recommend that you 

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:23.250
 do not add waste from plants that 

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:26.100
 have had problems with pests and 

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:28.740
 diseases to prevent that when adding 

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:30.620
 the compost again occur these 

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:34.440
 problems in the next crop 

00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:36.990
 neither do you add acid residues 

00:01:34.440 --> 00:01:39.619
 try watering and flipping your pile of 

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:42.390
 composting a couple of times per week 

00:01:39.619 --> 00:01:44.970
 good as you see my compost pile 

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:47.729
 It was basically made up of waste 

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:50.310
 of tomato so there were many parts 

00:01:47.729 --> 00:01:52.770
 woody that are meant to be 

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:54.840
 harder compost 

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:57.690
 about these residues may appear 

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:59.910
 mushrooms to profitÃ³s I recommend you not 

00:01:57.690 --> 00:02:03.060
 remove them because they are helping 

00:01:59.910 --> 00:02:05.369
 further degrade this dignified matter 

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:08.789
 depending on the season the compost 

00:02:05.369 --> 00:02:10.920
 it will take more or less mature you can 

00:02:08.789 --> 00:02:13.200
 see that the compost pile is more or 

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:15.630
 less mature when it greatly reduces its 

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:18.660
 volume and acquire a brown hue 

00:02:15.630 --> 00:02:20.959
 blackish in my case I have not got 

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:22.890
 degrade plant matter completely 

00:02:20.959 --> 00:02:25.560
 dignified 

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:27.750
 but this is great for me to do 

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:30.030
 padded on the bench avoiding this way 

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:31.980
 losses by evapotranspiration and 

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:35.580
 getting the substrate to retain 

00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:37.670
 much more water little more to tell you than this 

00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:40.470
 it's just an example of how I do things 

00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:42.300
 so I leave the description a lot 

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:44.190
 of information for you to do things 

00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:46.740
 in your own way and surely a lot 

00:02:44.190 --> 00:02:48.630
 better than I could say that mine 

00:02:46.740 --> 00:02:50.610
 it is the most basic because I have not attended 

00:02:48.630 --> 00:02:53.130
 the compostera beyond once a month 

00:02:50.610 --> 00:02:55.920
 and the truth is that I'm happy with the 

00:02:53.130 --> 00:02:57.750
 final result the important thing is that you 

00:02:55.920 --> 00:03:00.270
 encourage composting that as you can see 

00:02:57.750 --> 00:03:04.130
 it's so difficult so nothing 

00:03:00.270 --> 00:03:04.130
 very big greeting for all chao 

00:03:06.980 --> 00:03:09.980
 how 

00:03:16.050 --> 00:03:19.050
 4
