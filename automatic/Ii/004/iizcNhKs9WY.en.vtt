14<00:00:00.359> okay<00:00:00.719> these<00:00:01.439> are<00:00:01.680> we've<00:00:02.520> got<00:00:02.700> seven

00:00:03.050 --> 00:00:03.060 
14 okay these are we've got seven

00:00:03.060 --> 00:00:07.010 
14 okay these are we've got seven
different<00:00:03.360> hickory<00:00:04.290> barks<00:00:04.680> here<00:00:05.720> and<00:00:06.720> there

00:00:07.010 --> 00:00:07.020 
different hickory barks here and there

00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:08.839 
different hickory barks here and there
are<00:00:07.170> more<00:00:07.470> but<00:00:07.500> all<00:00:08.370> of<00:00:08.610> them<00:00:08.670> have<00:00:08.760> a

00:00:08.839 --> 00:00:08.849 
are more but all of them have a

00:00:08.849 --> 00:00:11.660 
are more but all of them have a
distinctive<00:00:10.160> characteristic<00:00:11.160> about<00:00:11.460> them

00:00:11.660 --> 00:00:11.670 
distinctive characteristic about them

00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:13.520 
distinctive characteristic about them
where<00:00:12.240> you<00:00:12.330> can<00:00:12.509> see<00:00:12.690> where<00:00:12.870> the<00:00:12.990> loop<00:00:13.200> sets

00:00:13.520 --> 00:00:13.530 
where you can see where the loop sets

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:16.400 
where you can see where the loop sets
are<00:00:13.710> in<00:00:13.860> on<00:00:14.009> it<00:00:14.040> this<00:00:14.759> one<00:00:14.969> has<00:00:15.120> a<00:00:15.150> is<00:00:15.809> easiest

00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:16.410 
are in on it this one has a is easiest

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:18.740 
are in on it this one has a is easiest
of<00:00:16.680> all<00:00:17.070> of<00:00:17.250> them<00:00:17.369> to<00:00:17.430> see<00:00:17.640> it<00:00:18.240> actually<00:00:18.570> has<00:00:18.720> a

00:00:18.740 --> 00:00:18.750 
of all of them to see it actually has a

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:20.750 
of all of them to see it actually has a
loop<00:00:19.080> that<00:00:19.289> comes<00:00:19.500> and<00:00:19.740> should<00:00:20.070> connect<00:00:20.490> back

00:00:20.750 --> 00:00:20.760 
loop that comes and should connect back

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:24.279 
loop that comes and should connect back
together<00:00:21.330> in<00:00:21.600> the<00:00:22.170> wood<00:00:22.380> even<00:00:23.220> with<00:00:23.430> the

together in the wood even with the

00:00:24.289 --> 00:00:28.609 
together in the wood even with the
smaller<00:00:25.519> or<00:00:26.519> smoother<00:00:27.180> bark<00:00:27.449> would<00:00:27.750> the<00:00:28.349> loop

sets<00:00:28.980> are<00:00:29.189> in<00:00:29.369> there<00:00:29.580> you're<00:00:29.820> just<00:00:29.849> harder<00:00:30.720> to

00:00:30.859 --> 00:00:30.869 
sets are in there you're just harder to

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:33.139 
sets are in there you're just harder to
see<00:00:31.080> both<00:00:31.289> after<00:00:32.070> practice<00:00:32.489> and<00:00:32.520> looking<00:00:33.030> at

00:00:33.139 --> 00:00:33.149 
see both after practice and looking at

00:00:33.149 --> 00:00:34.790 
see both after practice and looking at
them<00:00:33.270> you<00:00:33.420> can<00:00:33.570> usually<00:00:33.930> tell<00:00:34.290> and<00:00:34.350> see<00:00:34.620> what

00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:34.800 
them you can usually tell and see what

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:36.680 
them you can usually tell and see what
they<00:00:34.920> are<00:00:35.070> it<00:00:35.520> was<00:00:35.700> just<00:00:35.850> aren't<00:00:36.120> cracks<00:00:36.390> in<00:00:36.630> a

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:36.690 
they are it was just aren't cracks in a

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:38.389 
they are it was just aren't cracks in a
wood<00:00:36.870> but<00:00:37.110> the<00:00:37.320> loot<00:00:37.530> sacks<00:00:37.829> and<00:00:38.040> here's<00:00:38.250> where

00:00:38.389 --> 00:00:38.399 
wood but the loot sacks and here's where

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:40.549 
wood but the loot sacks and here's where
the<00:00:38.520> park<00:00:38.760> is<00:00:38.879> thicker<00:00:39.210> and<00:00:39.450> it<00:00:40.050> come<00:00:40.230> up<00:00:40.379> in

00:00:40.549 --> 00:00:40.559 
the park is thicker and it come up in

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:43.160 
the park is thicker and it come up in
here<00:00:40.829> so<00:00:41.610> it<00:00:41.850> does<00:00:42.090> have<00:00:42.120> Luke<00:00:42.540> sets<00:00:42.840> in<00:00:43.050> them

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:43.170 
here so it does have Luke sets in them

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:45.020 
here so it does have Luke sets in them
but<00:00:43.320> their<00:00:43.500> heart<00:00:43.680> some<00:00:44.280> want<00:00:44.640> some<00:00:44.879> of<00:00:44.969> the

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:45.030 
but their heart some want some of the

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:47.630 
but their heart some want some of the
species<00:00:45.329> are<00:00:45.750> hickory<00:00:46.739> they're<00:00:46.920> easy<00:00:47.160> to<00:00:47.430> see

00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:47.640 
species are hickory they're easy to see

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:50.029 
species are hickory they're easy to see
some<00:00:48.000> of<00:00:48.120> them<00:00:48.239> are<00:00:48.600> different<00:00:49.079> and<00:00:49.170> this<00:00:49.829> one

00:00:50.029 --> 00:00:50.039 
some of them are different and this one

00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:53.720 
some of them are different and this one
is<00:00:50.190> a<00:00:51.289> this<00:00:52.289> bark<00:00:52.590> has<00:00:52.739> come<00:00:52.949> off<00:00:53.100> but<00:00:53.309> this<00:00:53.520> is

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:53.730 
is a this bark has come off but this is

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:57.380 
is a this bark has come off but this is
a<00:00:54.559> hickory<00:00:55.559> also<00:00:56.010> but<00:00:56.640> it<00:00:56.760> has<00:00:56.910> more<00:00:57.210> of<00:00:57.300> a

00:00:57.380 --> 00:00:57.390 
a hickory also but it has more of a

00:00:59.090 --> 00:00:59.100 
characteristics that you would see on

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:02.150 
characteristics that you would see on
some<00:01:00.000> of<00:01:00.120> the<00:01:00.180> other<00:01:00.629> trees<00:01:01.500> such<00:01:01.710> as<00:01:01.739> I<00:01:01.920> oak

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:07.180 
even though this has got a thicker part
it<00:01:04.619> has<00:01:04.920> more<00:01:05.580> of<00:01:05.970> a

thick on any of this species of hickory
this<00:01:14.090> all<00:01:14.420> is<00:01:14.660> very<00:01:14.960> thin<00:01:15.350> barked<00:01:15.590> tree<00:01:15.940> see

00:01:16.930 --> 00:01:16.940 
this all is very thin barked tree see

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:18.790 
this all is very thin barked tree see
all<00:01:17.120> of<00:01:17.270> the<00:01:17.390> hickories<00:01:17.960> got<00:01:18.140> a<00:01:18.170> thinner<00:01:18.500> bark

00:01:18.790 --> 00:01:18.800 
all of the hickories got a thinner bark

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:22.120 
all of the hickories got a thinner bark
on<00:01:19.040> it<00:01:19.450> then<00:01:20.450> we<00:01:20.690> look<00:01:20.870> at<00:01:21.020> the<00:01:21.140> ol<00:01:21.350> how<00:01:21.830> thick

00:01:22.120 --> 00:01:22.130 
on it then we look at the ol how thick

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:24.880 
on it then we look at the ol how thick
the<00:01:22.280> bark<00:01:22.520> is<00:01:22.670> on<00:01:22.910> that<00:01:23.090> and<00:01:23.750> then<00:01:24.440> this<00:01:24.680> is

00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:24.890 
the bark is on that and then this is

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:30.280 
the bark is on that and then this is
walnut<00:01:25.270> and<00:01:26.270> in<00:01:26.480> and<00:01:26.870> it<00:01:27.260> also<00:01:27.530> has<00:01:27.770> a<00:01:29.290> thin

00:01:30.280 --> 00:01:30.290 
walnut and in and it also has a thin

00:01:30.290 --> 00:01:35.140 
walnut and in and it also has a thin
bark<00:01:30.590> on<00:01:30.770> it<00:01:30.920> too<00:01:31.130> now<00:01:31.340> got<00:01:32.180> walnut<00:01:32.780> is<00:01:34.150> also

00:01:35.140 --> 00:01:35.150 
bark on it too now got walnut is also

00:01:35.150 --> 00:01:37.960 
bark on it too now got walnut is also
used<00:01:35.450> as<00:01:35.750> a<00:01:35.810> smoking<00:01:36.380> would<00:01:36.560> also<00:01:36.740> and<00:01:37.190> when<00:01:37.850> it

00:01:37.960 --> 00:01:37.970 
used as a smoking would also and when it

00:01:37.970 --> 00:01:41.650 
used as a smoking would also and when it
is<00:01:38.000> cut<00:01:38.360> cut<00:01:38.780> up<00:01:38.960> it<00:01:39.620> does<00:01:40.010> on<00:01:40.340> the<00:01:40.400> inside<00:01:41.390> it

does have varying these could be species

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:46.720 
does have varying these could be species
variations<00:01:45.290> or<00:01:45.440> whatever<00:01:45.710> but<00:01:46.280> you<00:01:46.430> can<00:01:46.580> see

00:01:46.720 --> 00:01:46.730 
variations or whatever but you can see

00:01:46.730 --> 00:01:48.040 
variations or whatever but you can see
that<00:01:47.030> they<00:01:47.210> all<00:01:47.480> have<00:01:47.750> the<00:01:47.840> same

00:01:48.040 --> 00:01:48.050 
that they all have the same

00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:51.580 
that they all have the same
characteristics<00:01:48.530> and<00:01:49.250> the<00:01:50.290> walnut<00:01:51.290> has

00:01:51.580 --> 00:01:51.590 
characteristics and the walnut has

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:53.710 
characteristics and the walnut has
having<00:01:51.950> a<00:01:52.040> like<00:01:52.250> being<00:01:52.550> to<00:01:52.790> the<00:01:52.910> outside<00:01:53.360> of<00:01:53.390> it

00:01:53.710 --> 00:01:53.720 
having a like being to the outside of it

00:01:53.720 --> 00:01:55.780 
having a like being to the outside of it
this<00:01:54.080> one<00:01:54.320> just<00:01:54.350> has<00:01:54.680> a<00:01:54.710> thicker<00:01:55.130> band<00:01:55.370> in<00:01:55.640> it

00:01:55.780 --> 00:01:55.790 
this one just has a thicker band in it

00:01:55.790 --> 00:01:57.610 
this one just has a thicker band in it
but<00:01:55.910> it<00:01:56.060> looks<00:01:56.390> like<00:01:56.570> they've<00:01:56.780> on<00:01:57.140> the<00:01:57.320> largest

00:01:57.610 --> 00:01:57.620 
but it looks like they've on the largest

this last piece is a piece off locust
and<00:02:32.870> it's<00:02:33.050> totally<00:02:33.410> different<00:02:34.010> from<00:02:34.130> most

00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:34.730 
and it's totally different from most

and it's totally different from most
reasons<00:02:35.239> you<00:02:35.390> see<00:02:35.570> because<00:02:35.750> they<00:02:36.050> got<00:02:36.980> a

gurjit ated green I call it a lack of a
better<00:02:42.470> word<00:02:42.740> but<00:02:43.360> when<00:02:44.360> it's<00:02:44.510> this<00:02:44.990> has<00:02:45.230> been

00:02:45.370 --> 00:02:45.380 
better word but when it's this has been

00:02:45.380 --> 00:02:48.070 
better word but when it's this has been
split<00:02:45.680> recently<00:02:46.580> when<00:02:47.150> it's<00:02:47.330> sitting<00:02:47.720> out<00:02:48.050> in

00:02:48.070 --> 00:02:48.080 
split recently when it's sitting out in

up as other hardwoods age and get and

00:02:56.150 --> 00:03:00.220 
up as other hardwoods age and get and
turn<00:02:56.930> the<00:02:57.080> characteristics<00:02:57.470> to<00:02:57.950> that<00:02:59.230> that

00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:00.230 
turn the characteristics to that that

00:03:00.230 --> 00:03:03.520 
turn the characteristics to that that
are<00:03:00.610> browning<00:03:01.610> or<00:03:01.760> tanning<00:03:02.180> of<00:03:02.300> the<00:03:02.420> wood<00:03:02.600> it

are browning or tanning of the wood it
this<00:03:04.160> way<00:03:04.340> what<00:03:04.700> will<00:03:04.880> actually<00:03:05.030> change<00:03:05.570> to<00:03:05.900> an

00:03:05.950 --> 00:03:05.960 
this way what will actually change to an

00:03:05.960 --> 00:03:08.410 
this way what will actually change to an
orange<00:03:06.320> shoe<00:03:06.530> on<00:03:06.740> it<00:03:06.860> and<00:03:07.040> that's<00:03:08.000> how<00:03:08.120> you<00:03:08.180> can

00:03:08.410 --> 00:03:08.420 
orange shoe on it and that's how you can

00:03:08.420 --> 00:03:11.650 
orange shoe on it and that's how you can
tell<00:03:08.920> locust<00:03:09.920> what<00:03:10.220> color<00:03:10.610> is<00:03:10.700> locust<00:03:11.240> when<00:03:11.510> it

18<00:05:57.190> hours<00:05:57.729> so<00:05:58.330> you<00:05:58.419> want<00:05:58.780> to<00:05:58.870> have<00:05:59.080> a<00:05:59.320> beautiful

00:05:59.820 --> 00:05:59.830 
18 hours so you want to have a beautiful

00:05:59.830 --> 00:06:01.860 
18 hours so you want to have a beautiful
sort<00:05:59.979> of<00:06:00.070> perfuming<00:06:00.610> of<00:06:00.849> that<00:06:01.150> we<00:06:01.330> want<00:06:01.630> to<00:06:01.690> get

00:06:01.860 --> 00:06:01.870 
sort of perfuming of that we want to get

00:06:01.870 --> 00:06:03.570 
sort of perfuming of that we want to get
it<00:06:02.020> penetrated<00:06:02.500> into<00:06:02.680> the<00:06:02.830> wood<00:06:02.979> but<00:06:03.430> if<00:06:03.520> you

00:06:03.570 --> 00:06:03.580 
it penetrated into the wood but if you

00:06:03.580 --> 00:06:09.210 
it penetrated into the wood but if you
use<00:06:03.610> a<00:06:04.050> strong<00:06:05.050> flavor<00:06:06.270> would<00:06:07.270> on<00:06:08.220> something

00:06:09.210 --> 00:06:09.220 
use a strong flavor would on something

00:06:09.220 --> 00:06:12.000 
use a strong flavor would on something
like<00:06:09.310> a<00:06:09.370> brisket<00:06:09.669> over<00:06:09.849> 12<00:06:10.060> or<00:06:10.180> 18<00:06:10.240> hours<00:06:11.010> that

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:12.010 
like a brisket over 12 or 18 hours that

00:06:12.010 --> 00:06:15.060 
like a brisket over 12 or 18 hours that
to<00:06:12.370> me<00:06:12.520> then<00:06:12.900> starts<00:06:13.900> to<00:06:14.050> change<00:06:14.800> the

00:06:15.060 --> 00:06:15.070 
to me then starts to change the

00:06:15.070 --> 00:06:18.360 
to me then starts to change the
character<00:06:15.490> of<00:06:15.520> the<00:06:15.760> meat<00:06:15.910> itself<00:06:16.830> so<00:06:17.830> would

00:06:18.360 --> 00:06:18.370 
character of the meat itself so would

00:06:18.370 --> 00:06:20.339 
character of the meat itself so would
you<00:06:18.460> consider<00:06:18.669> is<00:06:19.090> wrong<00:06:19.450> flavored<00:06:20.110> would

00:06:20.339 --> 00:06:20.349 
you consider is wrong flavored would

00:06:20.349 --> 00:06:22.980 
you consider is wrong flavored would
well<00:06:21.039> I<00:06:21.070> think<00:06:21.460> a<00:06:21.729> hickory<00:06:22.090> is<00:06:22.330> a<00:06:22.389> strong<00:06:22.840> as

00:06:22.980 --> 00:06:22.990 
well I think a hickory is a strong as

00:06:22.990 --> 00:06:25.180 
well I think a hickory is a strong as
much<00:06:23.380> more<00:06:23.650> of<00:06:23.740> a<00:06:23.800> strong<00:06:24.010> flavor<00:06:24.190> blizzard

00:06:25.180 --> 00:06:25.190 
much more of a strong flavor blizzard

00:06:25.190 --> 00:06:30.040 
much more of a strong flavor blizzard
and<00:06:25.640> then<00:06:25.880> say<00:06:26.120> than<00:06:27.020> an<00:06:27.140> oak<00:06:27.290> and<00:06:28.930> you<00:06:29.930> know

00:06:30.040 --> 00:06:30.050 
and then say than an oak and you know

00:06:30.050 --> 00:06:32.110 
and then say than an oak and you know
and<00:06:30.290> I<00:06:30.350> think<00:06:30.590> also<00:06:30.860> if<00:06:31.340> you<00:06:31.460> use<00:06:31.700> sort<00:06:31.970> of<00:06:32.030> a

00:06:32.110 --> 00:06:32.120 
and I think also if you use sort of a

00:06:32.120 --> 00:06:34.630 
and I think also if you use sort of a
milder<00:06:32.570> would<00:06:32.780> like<00:06:33.230> a<00:06:33.500> while<00:06:34.010> the<00:06:34.160> Applewood

00:06:34.630 --> 00:06:34.640 
milder would like a while the Applewood

00:06:34.640 --> 00:06:37.930 
milder would like a while the Applewood
cherry<00:06:35.030> wood<00:06:35.240> on<00:06:35.510> stuff<00:06:36.050> like<00:06:36.140> ribs<00:06:36.680> I<00:06:37.460> think

00:06:37.930 --> 00:06:37.940 
cherry wood on stuff like ribs I think

00:06:37.940 --> 00:06:40.060 
cherry wood on stuff like ribs I think
that's<00:06:38.330> really<00:06:38.600> nice<00:06:38.870> and<00:06:39.140> it<00:06:39.290> adds<00:06:39.650> a<00:06:39.800> really

00:06:40.060 --> 00:06:40.070 
that's really nice and it adds a really

00:06:40.070 --> 00:06:41.770 
that's really nice and it adds a really
nice<00:06:40.310> characteristic<00:06:41.030> it<00:06:41.420> burns

00:06:41.770 --> 00:06:41.780 
nice characteristic it burns

00:06:41.780 --> 00:06:44.980 
nice characteristic it burns
surprisingly<00:06:42.260> slow<00:06:42.880> you<00:06:43.880> know<00:06:44.030> it's<00:06:44.390> it's

00:06:44.980 --> 00:06:44.990 
surprisingly slow you know it's it's

00:06:44.990 --> 00:06:46.990 
surprisingly slow you know it's it's
nice<00:06:45.230> so<00:06:45.560> it<00:06:46.190> just<00:06:46.220> depends<00:06:46.610> on<00:06:46.730> what<00:06:46.850> you're

00:06:46.990 --> 00:06:47.000 
nice so it just depends on what you're

00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:49.390 
nice so it just depends on what you're
making<00:06:47.390> you<00:06:47.660> know<00:06:47.780> pecan<00:06:48.200> goes<00:06:48.500> great<00:06:48.920> I<00:06:49.160> think

00:06:49.390 --> 00:06:49.400 
making you know pecan goes great I think

00:06:49.400 --> 00:06:52.570 
making you know pecan goes great I think
with<00:06:49.550> the<00:06:49.940> chicken<00:06:50.530> and<00:06:51.530> and<00:06:51.890> I<00:06:52.070> guess<00:06:52.280> the

00:06:52.570 --> 00:06:52.580 
with the chicken and and I guess the

00:06:52.580 --> 00:06:55.180 
with the chicken and and I guess the
mesquite<00:06:53.410> when<00:06:54.410> would<00:06:54.590> you<00:06:54.680> use<00:06:54.710> mesquite

00:06:55.180 --> 00:06:55.190 
mesquite when would you use mesquite

00:06:55.190 --> 00:06:57.820 
mesquite when would you use mesquite
because<00:06:55.490> it's<00:06:55.670> got<00:06:55.790> such<00:06:56.030> that<00:06:56.330> takes<00:06:56.830> takes

00:06:57.820 --> 00:06:57.830 
because it's got such that takes takes

00:06:57.830 --> 00:07:00.040 
because it's got such that takes takes
only<00:06:58.070> that's<00:06:58.880> all<00:06:59.060> I<00:06:59.150> use<00:06:59.480> before<00:06:59.690> I<00:06:59.900> mean

00:07:00.040 --> 00:07:00.050 
only that's all I use before I mean

00:07:00.050 --> 00:07:02.170 
only that's all I use before I mean
people<00:07:00.200> have<00:07:00.410> must<00:07:00.650> execute<00:07:00.980> mesquite<00:07:01.550> for

00:07:02.170 --> 00:07:02.180 
people have must execute mesquite for

00:07:02.180 --> 00:07:04.810 
people have must execute mesquite for
brisket<00:07:02.480> but<00:07:03.230> what<00:07:03.740> they<00:07:03.890> do<00:07:03.950> like<00:07:04.640> for

00:07:04.810 --> 00:07:04.820 
brisket but what they do like for

00:07:04.820 --> 00:07:06.310 
brisket but what they do like for
example<00:07:04.850> if<00:07:05.240> Cooper's<00:07:05.540> barbecue<00:07:05.750> and<00:07:06.140> llano

00:07:06.310 --> 00:07:06.320 
example if Cooper's barbecue and llano

00:07:06.320 --> 00:07:08.590 
example if Cooper's barbecue and llano
and<00:07:07.130> a<00:07:07.400> lot<00:07:07.580> of<00:07:07.610> places<00:07:07.910> out<00:07:08.180> there<00:07:08.210> they'll

00:07:08.590 --> 00:07:08.600 
and a lot of places out there they'll

00:07:08.600 --> 00:07:09.850 
and a lot of places out there they'll
take<00:07:08.750> that<00:07:08.930> mesquite<00:07:09.230> and<00:07:09.260> they'll<00:07:09.500> burn<00:07:09.710> it

00:07:09.850 --> 00:07:09.860 
take that mesquite and they'll burn it

00:07:09.860 --> 00:07:11.830 
take that mesquite and they'll burn it
down<00:07:09.890> into<00:07:10.310> embers<00:07:10.700> right<00:07:11.090> so<00:07:11.360> and<00:07:11.600> then

00:07:11.830 --> 00:07:11.840 
down into embers right so and then

00:07:11.840 --> 00:07:14.800 
down into embers right so and then
they'll<00:07:12.020> take<00:07:12.170> really<00:07:12.710> long<00:07:12.860> handle<00:07:13.400> like<00:07:13.810> six

00:07:14.800 --> 00:07:14.810 
they'll take really long handle like six

00:07:14.810 --> 00:07:18.430 
they'll take really long handle like six
or<00:07:14.960> ten<00:07:15.170> foot<00:07:16.120> handled<00:07:17.120> shovels<00:07:17.570> and<00:07:17.780> they'll

00:07:18.430 --> 00:07:18.440 
or ten foot handled shovels and they'll

00:07:18.440 --> 00:07:20.650 
or ten foot handled shovels and they'll
actually<00:07:18.650> take<00:07:19.100> these<00:07:19.310> mesquite<00:07:19.790> embers<00:07:20.150> move

00:07:20.650 --> 00:07:20.660 
actually take these mesquite embers move

00:07:20.660 --> 00:07:24.220 
actually take these mesquite embers move
them<00:07:20.810> over<00:07:21.080> to<00:07:21.920> the<00:07:22.790> pit<00:07:23.060> and<00:07:23.270> so<00:07:24.080> their

00:07:24.220 --> 00:07:24.230 
them over to the pit and so their

00:07:24.230 --> 00:07:26.710 
them over to the pit and so their
cooking<00:07:24.680> on<00:07:24.800> only<00:07:25.610> the<00:07:25.910> embers<00:07:26.390> they're<00:07:26.540> not

00:07:26.710 --> 00:07:26.720 
cooking on only the embers they're not

00:07:26.720 --> 00:07:30.250 
cooking on only the embers they're not
smoking<00:07:27.500> from<00:07:28.390> you<00:07:29.390> know<00:07:29.510> because<00:07:29.990> if<00:07:30.110> there

00:07:30.250 --> 00:07:30.260 
smoking from you know because if there

00:07:30.260 --> 00:07:33.909 
smoking from you know because if there
is<00:07:30.440> a<00:07:30.470> very<00:07:30.950> it<00:07:31.370> could<00:07:31.490> be<00:07:31.610> a<00:07:31.640> very<00:07:31.940> harsh<00:07:32.919> would

00:07:33.909 --> 00:07:33.919 
is a very it could be a very harsh would

00:07:33.919 --> 00:07:35.680 
is a very it could be a very harsh would
so<00:07:34.460> that's<00:07:34.669> what<00:07:34.880> and<00:07:35.090> I've<00:07:35.180> done<00:07:35.480> that

00:07:35.680 --> 00:07:35.690 
so that's what and I've done that

00:07:35.690 --> 00:07:37.600 
so that's what and I've done that
actually<00:07:35.930> I've<00:07:36.290> done<00:07:36.530> the<00:07:36.680> mesquite<00:07:37.070> with<00:07:37.520> the

00:07:37.600 --> 00:07:37.610 
actually I've done the mesquite with the

00:07:37.610 --> 00:07:40.120 
actually I've done the mesquite with the
brisket<00:07:38.000> but<00:07:38.300> I<00:07:38.360> only<00:07:38.540> do<00:07:38.750> it<00:07:38.780> that<00:07:39.080> way<00:07:39.320> which

00:07:40.120 --> 00:07:40.130 
brisket but I only do it that way which

00:07:40.130 --> 00:07:41.770 
brisket but I only do it that way which
is<00:07:40.280> something<00:07:40.790> you<00:07:41.090> know<00:07:41.240> I<00:07:41.270> learned<00:07:41.540> out<00:07:41.660> in

00:07:41.770 --> 00:07:41.780 
is something you know I learned out in

00:07:41.780 --> 00:07:43.750 
is something you know I learned out in
West<00:07:41.900> Texas<00:07:41.990> but<00:07:42.410> that's<00:07:42.650> you<00:07:43.220> know<00:07:43.250> mesquite

00:07:43.750 --> 00:07:43.760 
West Texas but that's you know mesquite

00:07:43.760 --> 00:07:45.760 
West Texas but that's you know mesquite
yeah<00:07:44.480> I<00:07:44.510> would<00:07:44.810> use<00:07:44.960> it<00:07:45.080> if<00:07:45.169> I<00:07:45.230> can<00:07:45.350> do<00:07:45.440> a<00:07:45.500> fast

00:07:45.760 --> 00:07:45.770 
yeah I would use it if I can do a fast

00:07:45.770 --> 00:07:48.370 
yeah I would use it if I can do a fast
thing<00:07:46.040> like<00:07:46.220> a<00:07:46.250> steak<00:07:46.610> or<00:07:46.910> I<00:07:47.450> burn<00:07:47.930> it<00:07:48.230> all<00:07:48.350> down

00:07:48.370 --> 00:07:48.380 
thing like a steak or I burn it all down

00:07:48.380 --> 00:07:53.590 
thing like a steak or I burn it all down
and<00:07:48.950> you<00:07:49.130> just<00:07:49.400> hold<00:07:50.120> off<00:07:50.480> for<00:07:51.140> a<00:07:51.290> brisket
