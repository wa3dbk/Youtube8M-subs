00:00:03.799 --> 00:00:09.000
 Hello everyone and today we have a video in 

00:00:06.839 --> 00:00:11.490
 heading beads and we will learn 

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:15.089
 make a beautiful bead necklace and so 

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:18.449
 let's start for beaded hookah 

00:00:15.089 --> 00:00:23.689
 you will need beads with us then 

00:00:18.449 --> 00:00:26.490
 you will need a scissors cutter 

00:00:23.689 --> 00:00:28.920
 round pliers then here such 

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:36.300
 tips that we will decorate 

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:37.200
 ends two circles connecting then 

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:39.600
 2 

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:43.920
 two such here is a pin with a rounded end and 

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:45.570
 clasp so let's get down for 

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:48.390
 I started cutting the line 

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:52.079
 but what size do I want 

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:54.870
 I had our necklace pomera around my neck 

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:58.739
 and we need to tie you up with this 

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:59.940
 fishing line knot all here is very simple but us 

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:03.719
 will need to dial 

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:09.900
 six strands of beads we will be with you 

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:12.990
 weave a pigtail well I think it can 

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:16.200
 make everyone just we take the fishing line 

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:19.280
 tying a knot preferably several 

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:22.049
 so that our beads do not sleep with fishing line 

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:26.610
 few knots tie but you 

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:30.210
 tied up I just start typing here 

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:34.770
 so here's my beads again I repeat 

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:36.930
 I am typing 6 of such here after me 

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:38.369
 of how we strung together 6 of these 

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:40.770
 here are the bead threads 

00:01:38.369 --> 00:01:43.799
 now we need to tie him here 

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:46.399
 I see here too I have bound them here and 

00:01:43.799 --> 00:01:50.490
 our end here these can already be trimmed 

00:01:46.399 --> 00:01:53.970
 now we need to wear this 

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:55.950
 here's a tip on these tips how are we 

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:59.850
 do we take from such a long 

00:01:55.950 --> 00:02:03.170
 pin and here's a rounded tip to us 

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:03.170
 need to open with you 

00:02:05.890 --> 00:02:16.600
 and hook here here in our beads here 

00:02:14.050 --> 00:02:25.920
 across the line hook and gently and again 

00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:25.920
 close neatly here help ourselves 

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:33.250
 here I have closed here I already see 

00:02:30.310 --> 00:02:36.340
 my beads are hanging on such pins now 

00:02:33.250 --> 00:02:41.580
 everything is very simple we take our tip 

00:02:36.340 --> 00:02:45.190
 we pass there a pin and so here it 

00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:48.610
 close as you can see now to us 

00:02:45.190 --> 00:02:56.980
 stays with here 's a pin cut on 

00:02:48.610 --> 00:03:02.980
 about a centimeter bend around 

00:02:56.980 --> 00:03:06.610
 round pliers I see that he does not see 

00:03:02.980 --> 00:03:11.230
 a lot so i need a little bit more 

00:03:06.610 --> 00:03:13.120
 cut me for a loop in general here 

00:03:11.230 --> 00:03:17.190
 yourself regulate someone makes big 

00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:17.190
 loops someone makes smaller loops 

00:03:19.230 --> 00:03:27.370
 here I am bending 

00:03:21.670 --> 00:03:29.680
 such a loop you can see so 

00:03:27.370 --> 00:03:31.420
 now we need to take the connecting 

00:03:29.680 --> 00:03:39.190
 ring on this side can already 

00:03:31.420 --> 00:03:42.790
 hook fastener open cling to 

00:03:39.190 --> 00:03:45.579
 this loop and cling to the fastener me 

00:03:42.790 --> 00:03:52.470
 this is such a carbine as you can 

00:03:45.579 --> 00:03:52.470
 see and everything and now we need to close 

00:04:00.430 --> 00:04:05.799
 everything is already closed we have one edge here 

00:04:04.120 --> 00:04:08.230
 there is such a clasp that we 

00:04:05.799 --> 00:04:10.540
 do now we need now just with 

00:04:08.230 --> 00:04:15.159
 weave the most ordinary pigtail for this i 

00:04:10.540 --> 00:04:16.139
 I will use a pin I just get on 

00:04:15.159 --> 00:04:19.269
 on the table 

00:04:16.139 --> 00:04:21.160
 pin me on the table tablecloths thread 

00:04:19.269 --> 00:04:25.440
 tablecloth pin here and so to 

00:04:21.160 --> 00:04:32.889
 kept share my 

00:04:25.440 --> 00:04:36.660
 beading thread at 3 starting to braid 

00:04:32.889 --> 00:04:39.610
 just a pigtail neatly 

00:04:36.660 --> 00:04:42.360
 the most ordinary way i want 

00:04:39.610 --> 00:04:45.009
 immediately note that you can basically 

00:04:42.360 --> 00:04:49.060
 use and more bead threads 

00:04:45.009 --> 00:04:52.000
 I take it, well, let's say a little bit 6 

00:04:49.060 --> 00:04:56.169
 pieces of everything you can take for example but 

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:58.979
 that's there 8 pieces under or 9 and it will be you 

00:04:56.169 --> 00:05:02.020
 just look thicker is a pigtail 

00:04:58.979 --> 00:05:04.930
 decoration here and in this way we 

00:05:02.020 --> 00:05:06.820
 just weave to the end and the next one 

00:05:04.930 --> 00:05:09.240
 the edge which we have is empty to us 

00:05:06.820 --> 00:05:12.039
 you need to do the same thing 

00:05:09.240 --> 00:05:15.460
 here is my necklace ready as you could 

00:05:12.039 --> 00:05:17.500
 notice what she is doing just here 

00:05:15.460 --> 00:05:19.630
 so here is the we braid it 

00:05:17.500 --> 00:05:22.360
 it seems very restrained to me that she 

00:05:19.630 --> 00:05:25.690
 will fit any clothes like this 

00:05:22.360 --> 00:05:27.580
 it turns out the necklace everyone thanks for
