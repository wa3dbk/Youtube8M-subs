00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:12.700
 our German journalist ayo cruz 

00:00:10.900 --> 00:00:15.070
 continue to have fun 

00:00:12.700 --> 00:00:17.590
 French in this 4th of September 

00:00:15.070 --> 00:00:19.660
 he explains to his fellow citizens how 

00:00:17.590 --> 00:00:20.220
 is the very French rite of the 

00:00:19.660 --> 00:00:22.539
 return 

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:25.720
 so we are at least September 

00:00:22.539 --> 00:00:29.079
 and in France the month of September is 

00:00:25.720 --> 00:00:31.480
 the least from there to go back to school 

00:00:29.079 --> 00:00:34.260
 how to describe to my compatriots the 

00:00:31.480 --> 00:00:37.270
 frenzy that takes hold of all France 

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:39.250
 the return to German is to say in case 

00:00:37.270 --> 00:00:41.980
 where to say ncaa 

00:00:39.250 --> 00:00:44.530
 the French come back and they 

00:00:41.980 --> 00:00:46.899
 come all together because in France 

00:00:44.530 --> 00:00:49.480
 summer there is no spreading of 

00:00:46.899 --> 00:00:52.239
 holidays the schools are all closed 

00:00:49.480 --> 00:00:52.840
 for two full months in July and 

00:00:52.239 --> 00:00:54.879
 August 

00:00:52.840 --> 00:00:58.239
 it's called by the way the big ones 

00:00:54.879 --> 00:01:00.550
 holidays the french people love to spend 

00:00:58.239 --> 00:01:02.679
 all together their holidays on 

00:01:00.550 --> 00:01:05.170
 crowded beaches in campsites 

00:01:02.679 --> 00:01:07.660
 overloaded or on the paths of great 

00:01:05.170 --> 00:01:08.640
 hike that sometimes looks like 

00:01:07.660 --> 00:01:12.280
 highways 

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:14.829
 meanwhile paris the capital is 

00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:16.750
 abandoned to foreign tourists the 

00:01:14.829 --> 00:01:19.090
 france cities especially in the 

00:01:16.750 --> 00:01:21.310
 half north of the country displays closed 

00:01:19.090 --> 00:01:23.530
 have you ever tried to buy a 

00:01:21.310 --> 00:01:26.259
 baguette in the month of August do find a 

00:01:23.530 --> 00:01:26.799

00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:48.250

00:01:45.790 --> 00:01:49.960
 returned the huge traffic jams on 

00:01:48.250 --> 00:01:52.869

 their school bags their kits and their 

00:02:01.299 --> 00:02:04.539

00:02:01.930 --> 00:02:05.920
 these are the unavoidable races of 

00:02:04.539 --> 00:02:07.899
 back to school for which the 

00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:09.340

00:02:11.230 --> 00:02:15.910
