I'm going to show you how to make fire
beats<00:00:09.780> so<00:00:10.769> there's<00:00:11.010> all<00:00:11.160> different<00:00:11.190> kinds<00:00:11.519> of

00:00:11.900 --> 00:00:11.910 
beats so there's all different kinds of

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:14.990 
beats so there's all different kinds of
clay<00:00:12.150> beads<00:00:12.420> you<00:00:12.660> can<00:00:12.870> make<00:00:13.130> you<00:00:14.130> can<00:00:14.549> stick

00:00:14.990 --> 00:00:15.000 
clay beads you can make you can stick

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.019 
clay beads you can make you can stick
pieces<00:00:15.960> on<00:00:16.170> to<00:00:16.560> give<00:00:16.890> a<00:00:16.920> different<00:00:17.130> pattern<00:00:17.699> or

00:00:18.019 --> 00:00:18.029 
pieces on to give a different pattern or

00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:22.189 
pieces on to give a different pattern or
effect<00:00:18.390> you<00:00:19.350> can<00:00:19.800> make<00:00:20.699> ones<00:00:21.180> with<00:00:21.539> holes<00:00:21.900> in

00:00:22.189 --> 00:00:22.199 
effect you can make ones with holes in

00:00:22.199 --> 00:00:25.839 
effect you can make ones with holes in
so<00:00:22.859> that<00:00:23.600> you<00:00:24.600> can<00:00:24.779> see<00:00:25.019> all<00:00:25.140> the<00:00:25.260> way<00:00:25.380> through

00:00:25.839 --> 00:00:25.849 
so that you can see all the way through

00:00:25.849 --> 00:00:29.810 
so that you can see all the way through
you<00:00:26.849> can<00:00:26.880> have<00:00:27.539> square<00:00:28.320> shapes<00:00:28.710> with<00:00:29.130> patterns

00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:29.820 
you can have square shapes with patterns

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:35.299 
you can have square shapes with patterns
on<00:00:30.090> and<00:00:30.590> you<00:00:31.590> can<00:00:31.859> have<00:00:32.130> round<00:00:32.640> ones<00:00:33.980> with<00:00:34.980> bits

00:00:35.299 --> 00:00:35.309 
on and you can have round ones with bits

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:39.619 
on and you can have round ones with bits
stuck<00:00:35.700> on<00:00:36.320> you<00:00:37.320> can<00:00:37.710> have<00:00:38.040> stacked<00:00:38.610> ones<00:00:39.090> that

00:00:39.619 --> 00:00:39.629 
stuck on you can have stacked ones that

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:41.990 
stuck on you can have stacked ones that
are<00:00:39.809> a<00:00:40.200> little<00:00:40.260> bit<00:00:40.500> like<00:00:40.800> sweeties<00:00:41.370> or<00:00:41.700> some

00:00:41.990 --> 00:00:42.000 
are a little bit like sweeties or some

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:44.840 
are a little bit like sweeties or some
wage<00:00:42.210> will<00:00:42.390> stack<00:00:42.690> together<00:00:42.899> and<00:00:43.670> you<00:00:44.670> can

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:44.850 
wage will stack together and you can

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:47.600 
wage will stack together and you can
also<00:00:44.969> make<00:00:45.480> marbled<00:00:46.079> ones<00:00:46.320> which<00:00:47.250> are<00:00:47.430> really

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:47.610 
also make marbled ones which are really

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:50.270 
also make marbled ones which are really
simple<00:00:47.879> to<00:00:48.059> do<00:00:48.390> and<00:00:48.690> you<00:00:49.680> can<00:00:49.860> have<00:00:49.890> really

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:50.280 
simple to do and you can have really

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:53.720 
simple to do and you can have really
swirly<00:00:50.850> ones<00:00:51.170> which<00:00:52.170> were<00:00:52.350> used<00:00:52.649> which<00:00:53.579> are

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:53.730 
swirly ones which were used which are

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:56.540 
swirly ones which were used which are
made<00:00:53.879> using<00:00:54.149> canes<00:00:54.570> so<00:00:55.559> I've<00:00:55.890> conditioned<00:00:56.399> the

00:00:56.540 --> 00:00:56.550 
made using canes so I've conditioned the

00:00:56.550 --> 00:00:58.549 
made using canes so I've conditioned the
clay<00:00:56.789> and<00:00:57.090> now<00:00:57.480> I'm<00:00:57.629> going<00:00:57.840> to<00:00:57.960> make<00:00:58.140> the<00:00:58.320> beads

00:00:58.549 --> 00:00:58.559 
clay and now I'm going to make the beads

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:00.979 
clay and now I'm going to make the beads
so<00:00:58.940> we're<00:00:59.940> going<00:01:00.030> to<00:01:00.090> make<00:01:00.270> a<00:01:00.420> marble<00:01:00.750> effect

00:01:00.979 --> 00:01:00.989 
so we're going to make a marble effect

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:04.840 
so we're going to make a marble effect
bead<00:01:01.949> in<00:01:02.309> prime<00:01:03.270> o<00:01:03.480> or<00:01:03.690> polymer<00:01:04.080> clay<00:01:04.199> and<00:01:04.589> to

00:01:04.840 --> 00:01:04.850 
bead in prime o or polymer clay and to

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:07.640 
bead in prime o or polymer clay and to
do<00:01:05.850> this<00:01:06.030> we've<00:01:06.390> got<00:01:06.659> two<00:01:07.020> bits<00:01:07.350> of

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:07.650 
do this we've got two bits of

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:12.410 
do this we've got two bits of
conditioned<00:01:08.610> clay<00:01:08.970> and<00:01:09.299> a<00:01:10.260> tissue<00:01:10.619> blade<00:01:11.420> so

00:01:12.410 --> 00:01:12.420 
conditioned clay and a tissue blade so

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:14.270 
conditioned clay and a tissue blade so
to<00:01:12.479> start<00:01:12.930> off<00:01:13.110> with<00:01:13.439> I'm<00:01:13.740> going<00:01:13.979> to<00:01:14.040> place<00:01:14.250> a

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:14.280 
to start off with I'm going to place a

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:16.340 
to start off with I'm going to place a
small<00:01:14.640> a<00:01:14.820> bit<00:01:15.060> of<00:01:15.150> clay<00:01:15.360> on<00:01:15.509> top<00:01:15.540> of<00:01:15.840> the<00:01:15.960> larger

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:16.350 
small a bit of clay on top of the larger

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:23.870 
small a bit of clay on top of the larger
one<00:01:17.240> and<00:01:19.460> cut<00:01:20.460> out<00:01:21.110> an<00:01:22.110> equal<00:01:22.560> shape<00:01:22.860> and<00:01:23.250> then

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:23.880 
one and cut out an equal shape and then

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:28.580 
one and cut out an equal shape and then
I'm<00:01:24.210> just<00:01:24.450> going<00:01:24.689> to<00:01:24.810> cut<00:01:26.840> series<00:01:27.840> of<00:01:28.080> even

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:28.590 
I'm just going to cut series of even

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:32.749 
I'm just going to cut series of even
strips<00:01:29.180> try<00:01:30.180> and<00:01:30.270> make<00:01:30.420> them<00:01:30.689> as<00:01:31.460> similar<00:01:32.460> in

00:01:32.749 --> 00:01:32.759 
strips try and make them as similar in

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:35.960

size<00:01:33.000> as<00:01:33.329> possible<00:01:33.900> and<00:01:34.549> I'm<00:01:35.549> going<00:01:35.700> to<00:01:35.759> place

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:35.970 
size as possible and I'm going to place

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:39.170 
size as possible and I'm going to place
them<00:01:36.150> on<00:01:36.270> top<00:01:36.479> of<00:01:36.540> each<00:01:36.750> other<00:01:37.640> and<00:01:38.640> just<00:01:38.939> Pat

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:42.450 
them down to get out any air bubbles so

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:46.660 
them down to get out any air bubbles so
we've<00:01:42.570> got<00:01:42.750> like<00:01:42.930> a<00:01:42.960> big<00:01:43.740> clay<00:01:44.460> sandwich<00:01:45.090> and

00:01:46.660 --> 00:01:46.670 
we've got like a big clay sandwich and

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:54.820 
we've got like a big clay sandwich and
I'm<00:01:47.670> gonna<00:01:47.909> cut<00:01:48.710> just<00:01:49.710> down<00:01:49.950> the<00:01:50.100> middle<00:01:50.310> strip

00:01:54.820 --> 00:01:54.830 

00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:59.540 

and<00:01:55.830> just<00:01:56.160> cut<00:01:56.340> a<00:01:56.370> couple<00:01:56.610> of<00:01:56.850> them<00:01:57.090> and<00:01:58.550> then

00:01:59.540 --> 00:01:59.550 
and just cut a couple of them and then

00:01:59.550 --> 00:02:01.550 
and just cut a couple of them and then
to<00:02:00.060> make<00:02:00.270> your<00:02:00.480> bead<00:02:00.720> you're<00:02:01.050> just<00:02:01.230> going<00:02:01.440> to

00:02:01.550 --> 00:02:01.560 
to make your bead you're just going to

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:07.389 
to make your bead you're just going to
roll<00:02:02.310> your<00:02:02.760> three<00:02:03.060> strips<00:02:03.450> into<00:02:04.290> a<00:02:04.320> bead<00:02:04.890> shape

00:02:07.389 --> 00:02:07.399 

00:02:07.399 --> 00:02:12.100 

and<00:02:08.720> it<00:02:09.720> should<00:02:09.929> give<00:02:10.170> you<00:02:10.440> a<00:02:10.679> marbling<00:02:11.670> effect

00:02:12.100 --> 00:02:12.110 
and it should give you a marbling effect

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:14.690 
and it should give you a marbling effect
now<00:02:13.110> just<00:02:13.410> to<00:02:13.560> finish<00:02:13.710> off<00:02:13.980> the<00:02:14.190> bead<00:02:14.370> we<00:02:14.550> need

00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:14.700 
now just to finish off the bead we need

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:16.220 
now just to finish off the bead we need
to<00:02:14.790> put<00:02:14.940> a<00:02:14.970> hole<00:02:15.210> in<00:02:15.420> it<00:02:15.600> so<00:02:15.750> I'm<00:02:15.900> just<00:02:16.050> going<00:02:16.170> to

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:16.230 
to put a hole in it so I'm just going to

00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:20.030 
to put a hole in it so I'm just going to
use<00:02:16.470> a<00:02:16.500> piece<00:02:16.770> of<00:02:16.800> wire<00:02:17.160> or<00:02:17.490> a<00:02:17.580> head<00:02:17.970> pin<00:02:19.040> go

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:20.040 
use a piece of wire or a head pin go

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:24.260 
use a piece of wire or a head pin go
right<00:02:20.340> through<00:02:20.580> the<00:02:20.700> middle<00:02:22.130> and<00:02:23.130> out<00:02:24.120> the

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:24.270 
right through the middle and out the

00:02:24.270 --> 00:02:27.110 
right through the middle and out the
other<00:02:24.420> side<00:02:24.660> and<00:02:25.220> just<00:02:26.220> twist<00:02:26.459> it<00:02:26.700> around<00:02:26.790> in<00:02:27.030> a

00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:27.120 
other side and just twist it around in a

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:31.580 
other side and just twist it around in a
circle<00:02:27.150> to<00:02:27.660> make<00:02:27.930> a<00:02:27.959> nice<00:02:28.230> big<00:02:28.260> hole<00:02:29.060> and<00:02:30.590> often

00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:31.590 
circle to make a nice big hole and often

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:34.810 
circle to make a nice big hole and often
when<00:02:31.739> you're<00:02:31.980> making<00:02:32.610> a<00:02:32.850> hole<00:02:33.060> in<00:02:33.330> your<00:02:33.510> beads

00:02:34.810 --> 00:02:34.820 
when you're making a hole in your beads

00:02:34.820 --> 00:02:37.400 
when you're making a hole in your beads
it<00:02:35.820> distorts<00:02:36.330> the<00:02:36.390> shape<00:02:36.480> but<00:02:37.020> don't<00:02:37.200> wait<00:02:37.380> too

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:37.410 
it distorts the shape but don't wait too

00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:40.880 
it distorts the shape but don't wait too
much<00:02:37.620> you<00:02:38.010> can<00:02:38.160> adjust<00:02:38.520> that<00:02:38.610> afterwards<00:02:39.890> and

00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:40.890 
much you can adjust that afterwards and

00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:44.240 
much you can adjust that afterwards and
then<00:02:41.100> that's<00:02:41.280> all<00:02:41.550> ready<00:02:41.790> to<00:02:42.150> be<00:02:42.270> baked<00:02:43.250> so

00:02:44.240 --> 00:02:44.250 
then that's all ready to be baked so

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:47.990 
then that's all ready to be baked so
I've<00:02:44.640> put<00:02:44.940> my<00:02:44.970> beads<00:02:45.480> onto<00:02:46.290> a<00:02:46.650> baking<00:02:46.980> tray<00:02:47.280> and

00:02:47.990 --> 00:02:48.000 
I've put my beads onto a baking tray and

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:50.210 
I've put my beads onto a baking tray and
this<00:02:48.570> is<00:02:48.750> just<00:02:48.989> literally<00:02:49.350> a<00:02:49.500> piece<00:02:49.739> of<00:02:49.980> paper

00:02:50.210 --> 00:02:50.220 
this is just literally a piece of paper

00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:53.240 
this is just literally a piece of paper
that's<00:02:50.489> folded<00:02:50.790> in<00:02:51.150> a<00:02:51.239> console<00:02:51.690> Tina<00:02:51.930> shape<00:02:52.470> so

00:02:53.240 --> 00:02:53.250 
that's folded in a console Tina shape so

00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:54.890 
that's folded in a console Tina shape so
that<00:02:53.489> the<00:02:53.580> beads<00:02:53.790> are<00:02:54.060> separated<00:02:54.720> out<00:02:54.840> and

00:02:54.890 --> 00:02:54.900 
that the beads are separated out and

00:02:54.900 --> 00:02:56.449 
that the beads are separated out and
they're<00:02:55.200> not<00:02:55.230> going<00:02:55.500> to<00:02:55.560> stick<00:02:55.830> to<00:02:55.890> the<00:02:56.190> tray

00:02:56.449 --> 00:02:56.459 
they're not going to stick to the tray

00:02:56.459 --> 00:02:57.680 
they're not going to stick to the tray
and<00:02:56.700> they're<00:02:56.820> not<00:02:56.910> going<00:02:57.120> to<00:02:57.209> stick<00:02:57.420> to<00:02:57.480> each

00:02:57.680 --> 00:02:57.690 
and they're not going to stick to each

00:02:57.690 --> 00:03:00.920 
and they're not going to stick to each
other<00:02:58.049> and<00:02:58.610> I'm<00:02:59.610> going<00:02:59.880> to<00:02:59.940> put<00:03:00.450> them<00:03:00.630> in<00:03:00.780> the

00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:00.930 
other and I'm going to put them in the

00:03:00.930 --> 00:03:05.000 
other and I'm going to put them in the
oven<00:03:01.320> and<00:03:01.940> it's<00:03:02.940> going<00:03:03.209> to<00:03:03.269> be<00:03:03.420> at<00:03:03.560> 110<00:03:04.560> degrees

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:05.010 
oven and it's going to be at 110 degrees

00:03:05.010 --> 00:03:06.920 
oven and it's going to be at 110 degrees
and<00:03:05.370> I<00:03:05.640> want<00:03:05.790> them<00:03:06.000> in<00:03:06.120> there<00:03:06.269> for<00:03:06.480> 30<00:03:06.660> minutes

00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:06.930 
and I want them in there for 30 minutes

00:03:06.930 --> 00:03:08.900 
and I want them in there for 30 minutes
but<00:03:07.709> it's<00:03:07.860> a<00:03:07.950> good<00:03:08.100> idea<00:03:08.220> to<00:03:08.459> keep<00:03:08.610> an<00:03:08.760> eye<00:03:08.880> on

00:03:08.900 --> 00:03:08.910 
but it's a good idea to keep an eye on

00:03:08.910 --> 00:03:10.610 
but it's a good idea to keep an eye on
it<00:03:09.209> just<00:03:09.420> to<00:03:09.600> make<00:03:09.780> sure<00:03:09.810> that<00:03:10.350> they're<00:03:10.470> not

00:03:10.610 --> 00:03:10.620 
it just to make sure that they're not

00:03:10.620 --> 00:03:15.470 
it just to make sure that they're not
over<00:03:10.980> baking<00:03:11.690> or<00:03:12.690> burning<00:03:13.140> and<00:03:14.269> to<00:03:15.269> make<00:03:15.450> sure

00:03:15.470 --> 00:03:15.480 
over baking or burning and to make sure

00:03:15.480 --> 00:03:17.270 
over baking or burning and to make sure
that<00:03:15.870> I've<00:03:16.019> got<00:03:16.049> the<00:03:16.350> right<00:03:16.530> temperature<00:03:17.130> I'm

00:03:17.270 --> 00:03:17.280 
that I've got the right temperature I'm

00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:19.610 
that I've got the right temperature I'm
also<00:03:17.489> going<00:03:17.790> to<00:03:17.850> put<00:03:18.060> in<00:03:18.090> a<00:03:18.480> thermostat<00:03:19.380> in

00:03:19.610 --> 00:03:19.620 
also going to put in a thermostat in

00:03:19.620 --> 00:03:21.530 
also going to put in a thermostat in
there<00:03:20.190> with<00:03:20.340> them<00:03:20.580> which<00:03:20.730> I<00:03:20.880> can<00:03:21.030> keep<00:03:21.239> an<00:03:21.420> eye

00:03:21.530 --> 00:03:21.540 
there with them which I can keep an eye

00:03:21.540 --> 00:03:25.070 
there with them which I can keep an eye
on<00:03:22.130> so<00:03:23.130> just<00:03:23.610> pop<00:03:23.820> them<00:03:24.060> into<00:03:24.390> the<00:03:24.570> toaster

00:03:25.070 --> 00:03:25.080 
on so just pop them into the toaster

00:03:25.080 --> 00:03:26.930 
on so just pop them into the toaster
oven<00:03:25.130> now<00:03:26.130> if<00:03:26.280> you're<00:03:26.430> doing<00:03:26.580> this<00:03:26.730> at<00:03:26.910> home

00:03:26.930 --> 00:03:26.940 
oven now if you're doing this at home

00:03:26.940 --> 00:03:28.580 
oven now if you're doing this at home
and<00:03:27.269> you<00:03:27.330> don't<00:03:27.360> have<00:03:27.690> a<00:03:27.750> toaster<00:03:28.200> oven<00:03:28.230> you

00:03:28.580 --> 00:03:28.590 
and you don't have a toaster oven you

00:03:28.590 --> 00:03:30.890 
and you don't have a toaster oven you
can<00:03:28.830> just<00:03:29.070> use<00:03:29.280> your<00:03:29.489> regular<00:03:29.670> oven<00:03:30.090> that's

00:03:30.890 --> 00:03:30.900 
can just use your regular oven that's

00:03:30.900 --> 00:03:34.130 
can just use your regular oven that's
fine<00:03:31.350> but<00:03:31.680> if<00:03:31.830> you're<00:03:31.920> doing<00:03:32.130> it<00:03:32.370> a<00:03:32.400> lot<00:03:33.140> you

00:03:34.130 --> 00:03:34.140 
fine but if you're doing it a lot you

00:03:34.140 --> 00:03:35.600 
fine but if you're doing it a lot you
know<00:03:34.260> if<00:03:34.350> you're<00:03:34.500> baking<00:03:34.709> beads<00:03:35.040> all<00:03:35.250> the<00:03:35.280> time

00:03:35.600 --> 00:03:35.610 
know if you're baking beads all the time

00:03:35.610 --> 00:03:37.430 
know if you're baking beads all the time
then<00:03:35.940> it's<00:03:36.060> a<00:03:36.150> good<00:03:36.269> idea<00:03:36.390> to<00:03:36.600> have<00:03:36.840> a<00:03:36.870> separate

00:03:37.430 --> 00:03:37.440 
then it's a good idea to have a separate

00:03:37.440 --> 00:03:40.520 
then it's a good idea to have a separate
toaster<00:03:37.890> oven<00:03:38.190> for<00:03:38.519> it<00:03:38.730> and<00:03:39.260> just<00:03:40.260> close<00:03:40.470> that

00:03:40.520 --> 00:03:40.530 
toaster oven for it and just close that

00:03:40.530 --> 00:03:45.280 
toaster oven for it and just close that
up<00:03:40.799> and<00:03:41.690> it<00:03:42.690> should<00:03:42.870> be<00:03:42.989> ready<00:03:43.170> in<00:03:43.500> 30<00:03:44.100> minutes

00:03:45.280 --> 00:03:45.290 
up and it should be ready in 30 minutes

00:03:45.290 --> 00:03:48.289 
up and it should be ready in 30 minutes
so<00:03:46.290> once<00:03:46.620> it's<00:03:46.799> been<00:03:46.950> 30<00:03:47.250> minutes<00:03:47.400> you<00:03:48.030> can

00:03:48.289 --> 00:03:48.299 
so once it's been 30 minutes you can

00:03:48.299 --> 00:03:50.539 
so once it's been 30 minutes you can
open<00:03:48.780> the<00:03:48.870> oven<00:03:49.200> and<00:03:49.410> get<00:03:49.829> your<00:03:50.010> beads<00:03:50.220> out

00:03:50.539 --> 00:03:50.549 
open the oven and get your beads out

00:03:50.549 --> 00:03:53.660 
open the oven and get your beads out
just<00:03:51.450> use<00:03:51.630> a<00:03:51.720> towel<00:03:52.019> or<00:03:52.350> some<00:03:53.010> other<00:03:53.160> gloves<00:03:53.489> to

00:03:53.660 --> 00:03:53.670 
just use a towel or some other gloves to

00:03:53.670 --> 00:03:55.449 
just use a towel or some other gloves to
make<00:03:53.700> sure<00:03:53.940> you<00:03:54.030> don't<00:03:54.180> burn<00:03:54.360> yourself<00:03:54.510> and

00:03:55.449 --> 00:03:55.459 
make sure you don't burn yourself and

00:03:55.459 --> 00:03:58.039 
make sure you don't burn yourself and
you<00:03:56.459> want<00:03:56.640> to<00:03:56.790> leave<00:03:56.940> your<00:03:57.090> beads<00:03:57.329> to<00:03:57.630> cool<00:03:57.840> for

00:03:58.039 --> 00:03:58.049 
you want to leave your beads to cool for

00:03:58.049 --> 00:03:59.840 
you want to leave your beads to cool for
a<00:03:58.110> little<00:03:58.350> while<00:03:58.530> before<00:03:58.980> you<00:03:59.310> start<00:03:59.610> using

00:03:59.840 --> 00:03:59.850 
a little while before you start using

00:03:59.850 --> 00:04:02.120 
a little while before you start using
them<00:04:00.209> so<00:04:01.050> you're<00:04:01.380> just<00:04:01.470> going<00:04:01.680> to<00:04:01.770> leave<00:04:01.920> them

00:04:02.120 --> 00:04:02.130 
them so you're just going to leave them

00:04:02.130 --> 00:04:04.490 
them so you're just going to leave them
on<00:04:02.250> the<00:04:02.370> side<00:04:02.400> to<00:04:02.880> cool<00:04:03.150> for<00:04:03.510> about<00:04:03.630> 20<00:04:04.319> minutes

00:04:04.490 --> 00:04:04.500 
on the side to cool for about 20 minutes

00:04:04.500 --> 00:04:04.910 
on the side to cool for about 20 minutes
and

00:04:04.910 --> 00:04:04.920 
and

00:04:04.920 --> 00:04:07.309 
and
they<00:04:05.130> call<00:04:05.340> down<00:04:05.610> if<00:04:06.390> you<00:04:06.630> touch<00:04:06.900> your<00:04:06.930> beads

00:04:07.309 --> 00:04:07.319 
they call down if you touch your beads

00:04:07.319 --> 00:04:09.140 
they call down if you touch your beads
at<00:04:07.530> this<00:04:07.680> stage<00:04:07.950> they'll<00:04:08.250> still<00:04:08.640> be<00:04:08.670> a<00:04:08.849> little

00:04:09.140 --> 00:04:09.150 
at this stage they'll still be a little

00:04:09.150 --> 00:04:11.900 
at this stage they'll still be a little
bit<00:04:09.300> soft<00:04:09.630> because<00:04:10.140> of<00:04:10.319> how<00:04:10.680> hot<00:04:10.920> they<00:04:11.069> are<00:04:11.220> but

00:04:11.900 --> 00:04:11.910 
bit soft because of how hot they are but

00:04:11.910 --> 00:04:14.470 
bit soft because of how hot they are but
when<00:04:12.060> they<00:04:12.180> cool<00:04:12.390> down<00:04:12.420> they'll<00:04:13.050> go<00:04:13.260> solid<00:04:13.950> and

00:04:14.470 --> 00:04:14.480 
when they cool down they'll go solid and

00:04:14.480 --> 00:04:18.680 
when they cool down they'll go solid and
that's<00:04:15.480> how<00:04:15.660> to<00:04:15.720> make<00:04:15.989> fire<00:04:16.260> beads
