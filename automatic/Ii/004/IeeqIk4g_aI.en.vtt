00:00:05.810 --> 00:00:10.530
 Hi everyone! How are you? My name is by me. 

00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:12.870
 I'm a teacher here, I'm from Morumbi. 

00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:15.030
 of Portuguese language from reading 

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:16.740
 and writing communication and I want 

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:19.109
 present to you a course that we 

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:19.949
 we have called reading strategies and 

00:00:19.109 --> 00:00:22.650
 writing 

00:00:19.949 --> 00:00:24.060
 what is the objective in this course does not 

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:25.109
 to think like this when we get here 

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:26.730
 at the University 

00:00:25.109 --> 00:00:28.470
 sometimes now just come 

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:31.050
 secondary education for a long period without 

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:31.830
 study where there is some time or during the 

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:33.360
 course 

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:36.090
 we often find some 

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:38.370
 points is not from our reading of writing 

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:39.570
 that we would like to complement or 

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:41.219
 to improve at last 

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:43.230
 so the idea is to pick the main 

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:45.600
 points that have to do with our reader 

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:48.450
 our writing and develop in this 

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:50.520
 course which is a distance course in which 

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:52.260
 You'll see there, so who does not have it? 

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:56.239
 photographic issues that people 

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:58.710
 need to resolve the situation 

00:00:56.239 --> 00:01:00.629
 organization in the sentence how the 

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:02.489
 structure b in a text in which I have 

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:04.350
 What do you think? 

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:06.060
 do many times in life 

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:07.950
 How does the story tell a story like it is? 

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:09.510
 that I read a story a sequence 

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:12.600
 in an appropriate way 

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:14.189
 how do I quote someone inside my 

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:16.500
 text is something we will do 

00:01:14.189 --> 00:01:19.020
 much in the academic context and even in the 

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:20.460
 professional context how do I 

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:22.560
 I have strategies for reading a text 

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:24.450
 better then the idea of â€‹â€‹this course is 

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:26.790
 basically this one but it has a 

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:27.540
 very cool differential any your 

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:31.079
 differential 

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:33.930
 when you are in this course and if you are 

00:01:31.079 --> 00:01:35.579
 an interesting you through the 

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:38.340
 the selection process, we made a 

00:01:35.579 --> 00:01:40.680
 survey of our students and saw 

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:42.570
 If you have any question, can we 

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:44.040
 I would like to suggest that you do 

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:45.990
 this course then you will realize that 

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:48.270
 there on your drive and web in your 

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:49.920
 blackberry will appear this course as 

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:51.570
 a course you can do then 

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:53.189
 people are suggesting this course he is 

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:55.829
 together with its other disciplines 

00:01:53.189 --> 00:01:59.070
 on our very blackberry platform 

00:01:55.829 --> 00:02:01.170
 well then you go there and you will find 

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:02.820
 a very interesting differential of each 

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:05.250
 course unit 

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:07.170
 we put a test that 's it you 

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:10.259
 will have five tests there for each 

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:13.470
 unit with a total of 40 tests that 

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:16.350
 What are you going to do there? 

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:18.870
 performing each activity if you are 

00:02:16.350 --> 00:02:21.210
 hit hard enough or if you've had more 

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:22.020
 difficulty at a particular point or in 

00:02:21.210 --> 00:02:23.790
 other 

00:02:22.020 --> 00:02:25.410
 you will be directed to 

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:27.060
 certain units 

00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:29.970
 so of course you will have the course 

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:33.150
 available if you want to do 

00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:34.500
 the course all the units there are 

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:36.360
 no problem 

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:39.480
 it will count on an activity to 

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:41.250
 you but you will get a feedback think 

00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:43.830
 that the fundamental point that sometimes 

00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:46.380
 people do not have anybody means like this 

00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:48.330
 Look, I feel some question there that I 

00:02:46.380 --> 00:02:52.290
 I think I could improve on reading a 

00:02:48.330 --> 00:02:53.790
 that point is what my text is 

00:02:52.290 --> 00:02:55.770
 There is a problem with stopping. 

00:02:53.790 --> 00:02:56.550
 is that your my sentences that are not 

00:02:55.770 --> 00:02:57.959
 clear 

00:02:56.550 --> 00:03:00.360
 Will it be that my problem is that I have 

00:02:57.959 --> 00:03:03.959
 so the difficulty with photography 

00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:05.400
 Then this pre-test situation will 

00:03:03.959 --> 00:03:09.209
 Give this feedback I think it's 

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:11.790
 fundamental for us to start this 

00:03:09.209 --> 00:03:13.380
 this new form of 

00:03:11.790 --> 00:03:14.520
 to develop our competence to 

00:03:13.380 --> 00:03:16.290
 reading and writing 

00:03:14.520 --> 00:03:18.330
 basically this is after you go 

00:03:16.290 --> 00:03:21.540
 find the units with activities 

00:03:18.330 --> 00:03:23.519
 after a test took another 

00:03:21.540 --> 00:03:25.709
 test is not going to show a little of the 

00:03:23.519 --> 00:03:28.380
 your progress and from this test that 

00:03:25.709 --> 00:03:30.239
 you will be able to validate the right activities 

00:03:28.380 --> 00:03:31.590
 course the idea is to make a 

00:03:30.239 --> 00:03:33.150
 complete course with this differential 

00:03:31.590 --> 00:03:36.000
 because I think it 's quite important 

00:03:33.150 --> 00:03:39.269
 this feedback that will tell you the 

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:41.760
 What exactly would be important is you? 

00:03:39.269 --> 00:03:43.890
 reinforce that in principle you will be 

00:03:41.760 --> 00:03:46.650
 only for these units 

00:03:43.890 --> 00:03:49.440
 in which you then had some 

00:03:46.650 --> 00:03:52.170
 commitment that needs a certain reinforcement 

00:03:49.440 --> 00:03:55.200
 this is one of our courses in the pro 

00:03:52.170 --> 00:03:56.700
 academic rectory made by codesp that 

00:03:55.200 --> 00:03:59.670
 is the development coordinator 

00:03:56.700 --> 00:04:02.010
 educational institution I invite you to 

00:03:59.670 --> 00:04:03.600
 you to cease your community 

00:04:02.010 --> 00:04:06.660
 other courses or broaden the borders 

00:04:03.600 --> 00:04:08.580
 Anyway, our idea is more and more 

00:04:06.660 --> 00:04:10.080
 encouraging and providing 

00:04:08.580 --> 00:04:13.670
 for you to perform 

00:04:10.080 --> 00:04:16.109
 increasingly important academic and 

00:04:13.670 --> 00:04:18.739
 constructive for your career 

00:04:16.109 --> 00:04:18.739
 it is
