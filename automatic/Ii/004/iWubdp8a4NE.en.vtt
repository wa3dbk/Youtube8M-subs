00:00:02.270 --> 00:00:07.220
 well let's take the opportunity to look at the 

00:00:05.020 --> 00:00:10.350
 east theme of the acoustic guitar in 

00:00:07.220 --> 00:00:12.390
 rhythmic plan with percussion hits 

00:00:10.350 --> 00:00:14.640
 and I also like it because I do not 

00:00:12.390 --> 00:00:17.490
 had almost never done and it came as a 

00:00:14.640 --> 00:00:19.800
 couple of years of interest in this 

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:22.590
 way of touching is not something that I do not 

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:25.290
 I had been very worried about her 

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:27.990
 but last 20 yes because I think it 's 

00:00:25.290 --> 00:00:30.030
 which gives you much roll to put it 

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:33.500
 way to acoustic guitars the 

00:00:30.030 --> 00:00:33.500
 give them some percussive blow 

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:41.809
 you see that it is 

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:46.000
 because this simulates almost the box of the 

00:00:41.809 --> 00:00:46.000
 battery with the refills then 

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:53.989
 you see that you have to take your hand more 

00:00:51.540 --> 00:00:53.989
 collection 

00:00:57.090 --> 00:00:59.930
 i 

00:01:02.120 --> 00:01:05.930
 bay 60 hits 

00:01:11.799 --> 00:01:15.549
 in the middle 

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:24.600
 Y 

00:01:29.730 --> 00:01:32.570
 i 

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:37.480
 Y 

00:01:47.649 --> 00:01:55.659
 I was scared a lot for you to be the 

00:01:52.549 --> 00:01:55.659
 box and what we are looking for 

00:02:03.670 --> 00:02:07.430
 man you have to look for life here 

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:08.660
 there is a technique that takes to cover 

00:02:07.430 --> 00:02:10.450
 here that you are looking for in life because 

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:14.330
 it depends a lot on what comes special 

00:02:10.450 --> 00:02:17.360
 come from throwing ropes come to follow 

00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:18.770
 what what I want to say no then 

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:20.870
 is to look for life and the truth that is not 

00:02:18.770 --> 00:02:23.520
 I fixed myself in good if you have to see 

00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:25.920
 get the truth in a bayern 

00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:27.450
 is that it does pretty good if you notice 

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:28.560
 a bit in some video and such but it is that 

00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:30.740
 I see that everyone looks for life as 

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:30.740
 can 

00:02:34.460 --> 00:02:37.460
 Y 

00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:42.000
 so I walk more for this is a 

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:46.250
 silly ming 

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:46.250
 for example you can touch it 

00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:51.650
 Y 

00:02:49.110 --> 00:02:51.650
 ah 

00:02:51.950 --> 00:02:56.240
 this literally written would be like that but 

00:02:54.379 --> 00:02:59.240
 yes i do 

00:02:56.240 --> 00:02:59.240
 ah 

00:03:03.330 --> 00:03:06.580
 you see 

00:03:04.480 --> 00:03:09.030
 instead of taking it like that I take it from a2 

00:03:06.580 --> 00:03:09.030
 alter 

00:03:09.750 --> 00:03:14.620
 ah 

00:03:11.860 --> 00:03:16.570
 here the ones so they are a lot this 

00:03:14.620 --> 00:03:19.180
 well written example would have to do 

00:03:16.570 --> 00:03:20.410
 so many signs here in the 

00:03:19.180 --> 00:03:23.020
 score that in the end it would be understood 

00:03:20.410 --> 00:03:25.450
 nothing in all these things expose and 

00:03:23.020 --> 00:03:27.280
 gigs now had not touched 

00:03:25.450 --> 00:03:29.850
 this I'm touching the protocol here 

00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:32.020
 I'm making it up but you see that with 

00:03:29.850 --> 00:03:35.010
 22 simple chords can be taken out 

00:03:32.020 --> 00:03:35.010
 much match of a guitar 

00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:41.360
 Y 

00:03:45.420 --> 00:03:57.290
 giving them more simple more softer 

00:04:00.020 --> 00:04:07.049
 Y 

00:04:02.930 --> 00:04:09.900
 you realize that vibrato goes on all the time 

00:04:07.049 --> 00:04:13.560
 ah 

00:04:09.900 --> 00:04:15.870
 these things but then honestly I 

00:04:13.560 --> 00:04:18.269
 I would love to be able to write them 

00:04:15.870 --> 00:04:19.670
 way and so that you could touch them 

00:04:18.269 --> 00:04:22.250
 same 

00:04:19.670 --> 00:04:24.650
 but but it is impossible this is 

00:04:22.250 --> 00:04:27.230
 a matter of you watching the video 20 times 

00:04:24.650 --> 00:04:29.060
 and try it, they are the same and this is not 

00:04:27.230 --> 00:04:30.950
 It can be described in any way or 

00:04:29.060 --> 00:04:33.640
 Nor can one explain this must be 

00:04:30.950 --> 00:04:33.640
 feel it a little 

00:04:40.409 --> 00:04:42.979
 and
