yellow doesn't show up against the light

this size it's almost impossible to see
but<00:01:58.010> we<00:01:58.520> can<00:01:58.670> actually<00:01:58.820> make<00:01:59.090> it<00:01:59.240> visible<00:01:59.420> by

but we can actually make it visible by

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:02.340 
but we can actually make it visible by
magnification<00:02:01.100> or<00:02:01.280> by<00:02:01.400> changing<00:02:01.790> the<00:02:01.910> light

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:02.350

what<00:02:26.600> if<00:02:26.690> I<00:02:26.810> don't<00:02:26.870> have<00:02:27.290> a<00:02:27.350> microscope<00:02:28.120> well

00:02:29.110 --> 00:02:29.120 
what if I don't have a microscope well

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:31.810 
what if I don't have a microscope well
in<00:02:29.510> that<00:02:29.720> case<00:02:29.959> you<00:02:30.170> could<00:02:30.380> use<00:02:30.770> a<00:02:31.220> blue<00:02:31.550> light

00:02:31.810 --> 00:02:31.820 
in that case you could use a blue light

00:02:31.820 --> 00:02:33.970 
in that case you could use a blue light
for<00:02:32.150> example<00:02:32.570> that<00:02:33.350> would<00:02:33.500> increase<00:02:33.800> the

00:02:33.970 --> 00:02:33.980 
for example that would increase the

00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:35.470 
for example that would increase the
contrast<00:02:34.370> because<00:02:34.790> if<00:02:34.940> you<00:02:35.060> look<00:02:35.209> at<00:02:35.300> the

00:02:35.470 --> 00:02:35.480 
contrast because if you look at the

00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:37.930 
contrast because if you look at the
yellow<00:02:35.600> dots<00:02:35.870> under<00:02:36.170> blue<00:02:36.410> light<00:02:36.700> then<00:02:37.700> the

00:02:37.930 --> 00:02:37.940 
yellow dots under blue light then the

00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:40.390 
yellow dots under blue light then the
yellow<00:02:38.090> dots<00:02:38.390> appear<00:02:38.750> black<00:02:39.040> it's<00:02:40.040> great<00:02:40.250> and

00:02:40.390 --> 00:02:40.400 
yellow dots appear black it's great and

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:42.729 
yellow dots appear black it's great and
I<00:02:40.489> actually<00:02:40.760> actually<00:02:41.660> have<00:02:41.959> a<00:02:42.380> blue<00:02:42.709> light

00:02:42.729 --> 00:02:42.739

is what a printed document looks like

00:03:08.630 --> 00:03:10.720 
is what a printed document looks like
under<00:03:08.900> a<00:03:08.930> blue<00:03:09.200> light<00:03:09.380> you<00:03:10.040> can<00:03:10.190> see<00:03:10.340> that<00:03:10.550> here

00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:10.730 
under a blue light you can see that here

00:03:10.730 --> 00:03:14.530 
under a blue light you can see that here
the<00:03:10.910> yellow<00:03:11.180> dots<00:03:11.420> appear<00:03:11.990> dark<00:03:12.910> so<00:03:13.910> once<00:03:14.390> you

00:03:14.530 --> 00:03:14.540 
the yellow dots appear dark so once you

00:03:14.540 --> 00:03:16.810 
the yellow dots appear dark so once you
found<00:03:14.780> out<00:03:14.930> about<00:03:14.960> this<00:03:15.380> set<00:03:15.830> what<00:03:16.460> actually

00:03:16.810 --> 00:03:16.820 
found out about this set what actually

00:03:16.820 --> 00:03:20.020 
found out about this set what actually
did<00:03:16.970> you<00:03:17.120> guys<00:03:17.720> do<00:03:18.190> well<00:03:19.190> we<00:03:19.340> took<00:03:19.490> a<00:03:19.550> look<00:03:19.790> at

00:03:20.020 --> 00:03:20.030 
did you guys do well we took a look at

00:03:20.030 --> 00:03:23.230 
did you guys do well we took a look at
the<00:03:20.300> sample<00:03:21.290> pages<00:03:21.530> that<00:03:21.890> we<00:03:22.010> printed<00:03:22.370> and<00:03:22.550> we

00:03:23.230 --> 00:03:23.240 
the sample pages that we printed and we

00:03:23.240 --> 00:03:24.880 
the sample pages that we printed and we
invited<00:03:23.600> the<00:03:23.690> public<00:03:23.840> to<00:03:24.170> send<00:03:24.350> their<00:03:24.530> samples

00:03:24.880 --> 00:03:24.890 
invited the public to send their samples

00:03:24.890 --> 00:03:26.620 
invited the public to send their samples
as<00:03:25.040> well<00:03:25.190> which<00:03:25.550> they<00:03:25.730> continue<00:03:26.150> to<00:03:26.180> do<00:03:26.420> and

00:03:26.620 --> 00:03:26.630 
as well which they continue to do and

00:03:26.630 --> 00:03:29.170 
as well which they continue to do and
they're<00:03:26.900> still<00:03:27.140> welcome<00:03:27.410> to<00:03:27.560> do<00:03:27.680> so<00:03:28.180> we've

00:03:29.170 --> 00:03:29.180 
they're still welcome to do so we've

00:03:29.180 --> 00:03:31.510 
they're still welcome to do so we've
built<00:03:29.360> up<00:03:29.540> a<00:03:29.690> collection<00:03:29.990> of<00:03:30.410> sample<00:03:31.160> printer

00:03:31.510 --> 00:03:31.520 
built up a collection of sample printer

00:03:31.520 --> 00:03:33.640 
built up a collection of sample printer
pages<00:03:31.850> and<00:03:32.060> we've<00:03:32.810> taken<00:03:32.990> a<00:03:33.230> look<00:03:33.320> at<00:03:33.470> them

00:03:33.640 --> 00:03:33.650 
pages and we've taken a look at them

00:03:33.650 --> 00:03:35.290 
pages and we've taken a look at them
under<00:03:33.920> blue<00:03:34.130> lights<00:03:34.340> and<00:03:34.520> under<00:03:34.760> microscopes

00:03:35.290 --> 00:03:35.300 
under blue lights and under microscopes

00:03:35.300 --> 00:03:37.630 
under blue lights and under microscopes
and<00:03:35.540> tried<00:03:36.320> to<00:03:36.500> characterize<00:03:36.709> the<00:03:37.220> patterns

00:03:37.630 --> 00:03:37.640 
and tried to characterize the patterns

00:03:37.640 --> 00:03:39.070 
and tried to characterize the patterns
and<00:03:37.880> try<00:03:38.180> to<00:03:38.240> figure<00:03:38.510> out<00:03:38.720> what<00:03:38.930> information

00:03:39.070 --> 00:03:39.080 
and try to figure out what information

00:03:39.080 --> 00:03:40.930 
and try to figure out what information
is<00:03:39.620> stored<00:03:39.830> there<00:03:40.040> and<00:03:40.190> how<00:03:40.640> its<00:03:40.790> represented

00:03:40.930 --> 00:03:40.940 
is stored there and how its represented

00:03:40.940 --> 00:03:42.699 
is stored there and how its represented
and<00:03:41.480> have<00:03:41.750> you<00:03:41.840> live<00:03:41.989> anything<00:03:42.410> from<00:03:42.560> this

00:03:42.699 --> 00:03:42.709 
and have you live anything from this

00:03:42.709 --> 00:03:44.770 
and have you live anything from this

in<00:04:28.220> fact<00:04:28.940> we<00:04:29.150> can<00:04:29.300> often<00:04:29.510> tell<00:04:29.810> just<00:04:30.169> by

00:04:30.219 --> 00:04:30.229 
in fact we can often tell just by

00:04:30.229 --> 00:04:32.920 
in fact we can often tell just by
looking<00:04:30.650> at<00:04:30.830> a<00:04:30.950> dot<00:04:31.340> pattern<00:04:31.550> what<00:04:32.390> kind<00:04:32.750> of

00:04:32.920 --> 00:04:32.930 
looking at a dot pattern what kind of

00:04:32.930 --> 00:04:35.170 
looking at a dot pattern what kind of
printer<00:04:33.260> made<00:04:33.440> that<00:04:33.650> print<00:04:33.950> even<00:04:34.550> if<00:04:34.850> we<00:04:34.970> don't

00:04:35.170 --> 00:04:35.180 
printer made that print even if we don't

printer made that print even if we don't
know<00:04:35.419> how<00:04:35.810> to<00:04:35.870> read<00:04:36.140> the<00:04:36.290> code<00:04:36.470> so<00:04:37.280> I<00:04:37.310> can<00:04:37.580> look

00:04:37.690 --> 00:04:37.700 
know how to read the code so I can look

00:04:37.700 --> 00:04:39.219 
know how to read the code so I can look
at<00:04:37.820> a<00:04:37.880> page<00:04:38.150> like<00:04:38.390> this<00:04:38.450> one<00:04:38.780> and<00:04:38.960> tell<00:04:39.110> you

00:04:39.219 --> 00:04:39.229 
at a page like this one and tell you

00:04:39.229 --> 00:04:40.659 
at a page like this one and tell you
that<00:04:39.380> it<00:04:39.470> was<00:04:39.590> made<00:04:39.800> on<00:04:39.830> a<00:04:40.010> Hewlett<00:04:40.250> Packard

00:04:43.060 --> 00:04:43.070 
color laserjet so if somebody has done

00:04:43.070 --> 00:04:44.560 
color laserjet so if somebody has done
this<00:04:43.280> they<00:04:43.550> found<00:04:43.760> the<00:04:43.970> printed<00:04:44.240> notes<00:04:44.390> the

00:05:29.230 --> 00:05:29.240 
long so you can let your printer company

00:05:29.240 --> 00:05:31.390 
long so you can let your printer company
know<00:05:29.360> if<00:05:29.510> you<00:05:29.660> object<00:05:29.750> to<00:05:30.110> this<00:05:30.230> well<00:05:31.040> thanks

00:05:31.390 --> 00:05:31.400
