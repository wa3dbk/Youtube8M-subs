sitting<00:04:23.270> in<00:04:23.390> the<00:04:23.960> fermentation<00:04:24.830> chamber<00:04:25.430> I

00:04:27.810 --> 00:04:27.820 

00:04:27.820 --> 00:04:31.120 

got<00:04:28.820> inspired<00:04:29.030> by<00:04:29.390> steel<00:04:29.690> jam<00:04:29.960> so<00:04:30.350> I<00:04:30.620> decided

00:04:31.120 --> 00:04:31.130 
got inspired by steel jam so I decided

00:04:31.130 --> 00:04:33.430 
got inspired by steel jam so I decided
why<00:04:31.430> not<00:04:31.460> I<00:04:32.330> needed<00:04:32.870> to<00:04:33.020> control<00:04:33.290> my

00:04:33.430 --> 00:04:33.440 
why not I needed to control my

00:04:33.440 --> 00:04:35.080 
why not I needed to control my
temperatures<00:04:33.860> better<00:04:34.070> and<00:04:34.370> what<00:04:34.640> better<00:04:34.850> to

00:04:35.080 --> 00:04:35.090 
temperatures better and what better to

00:04:35.090 --> 00:04:37.480 
temperatures better and what better to
do<00:04:35.210> it<00:04:35.330> with<00:04:35.980> within<00:04:36.980> with<00:04:37.100> an<00:04:37.220> all<00:04:37.370> grain

00:04:37.480 --> 00:04:37.490 
do it with within with an all grain

00:04:37.490 --> 00:04:39.190 
do it with within with an all grain
batch<00:04:37.790> I<00:04:38.000> really<00:04:38.510> did<00:04:38.660> not<00:04:38.690> want<00:04:38.840> to<00:04:38.990> screw

00:04:39.190 --> 00:04:39.200

this<00:04:39.230> up<00:04:39.580> and<00:04:40.580> I<00:04:41.450> think<00:04:41.570> we<00:04:42.020> nailed<00:04:42.260> it<00:04:42.410> on<00:04:42.530> the

00:04:42.580 --> 00:04:42.590 
this up and I think we nailed it on the

00:04:42.590 --> 00:04:51.820 
this up and I think we nailed it on the
head<00:04:49.990> say<00:04:50.990> i<00:04:51.020> just<00:04:51.320> thought<00:04:51.440> i'd<00:04:51.530> give<00:04:51.680> you<00:04:51.710> a

a<00:04:57.890> pumpkin<00:04:58.580> Hale<00:04:58.790> and<00:04:59.060> I'm<00:04:59.120> thinking<00:04:59.360> about

00:04:59.530 --> 00:04:59.540 
a pumpkin Hale and I'm thinking about

00:04:59.540 --> 00:05:03.850 
a pumpkin Hale and I'm thinking about
doing<00:04:59.690> it<00:05:00.110> extract<00:05:00.860> style<00:05:01.390> for<00:05:02.390> sheer<00:05:02.860> time

00:05:03.850 --> 00:05:03.860 
doing it extract style for sheer time

00:05:03.860 --> 00:05:07.290 
doing it extract style for sheer time
I've<00:05:04.580> heard<00:05:04.790> that<00:05:04.850> mashing<00:05:05.720> with<00:05:06.170> pumpkin

00:05:07.290 --> 00:05:07.300 
I've heard that mashing with pumpkin

00:05:07.300 --> 00:05:10.420 
I've heard that mashing with pumpkin
causes<00:05:08.300> some<00:05:08.540> pretty<00:05:09.020> bad<00:05:09.260> plug<00:05:09.620> ups<00:05:09.800> and<00:05:10.040> it

00:05:10.420 --> 00:05:10.430 
causes some pretty bad plug ups and it

00:05:10.430 --> 00:05:12.550 
causes some pretty bad plug ups and it
takes<00:05:10.700> a<00:05:10.880> very<00:05:11.180> long<00:05:11.300> time<00:05:11.480> to<00:05:11.990> drain<00:05:12.200> the<00:05:12.410> work

00:05:12.550 --> 00:05:12.560 
takes a very long time to drain the work

00:05:12.560 --> 00:05:15.130 
takes a very long time to drain the work
off<00:05:12.770> and<00:05:13.730> I've<00:05:13.820> heard<00:05:14.030> that<00:05:14.300> in<00:05:14.690> between<00:05:14.810> the

00:05:15.130 --> 00:05:15.140 
off and I've heard that in between the

00:05:15.140 --> 00:05:16.720 
off and I've heard that in between the
two<00:05:15.350> and<00:05:15.650> extract<00:05:16.100> versus<00:05:16.370> an<00:05:16.460> all<00:05:16.580> grain

00:05:16.720 --> 00:05:16.730 
two and extract versus an all grain

pumpkin<00:05:17.270> brew<00:05:17.440> he<00:05:18.440> can't<00:05:18.680> really<00:05:18.920> tell<00:05:19.130> too

00:05:19.300 --> 00:05:19.310 
pumpkin brew he can't really tell too

00:05:19.310 --> 00:05:21.250 
pumpkin brew he can't really tell too
much<00:05:19.460> of<00:05:19.610> a<00:05:19.670> difference<00:05:20.060> so<00:05:20.300> i<00:05:20.510> think<00:05:21.050> i'm

00:05:21.250 --> 00:05:21.260 
much of a difference so i think i'm

00:05:21.260 --> 00:05:22.780 
much of a difference so i think i'm
going<00:05:21.350> to<00:05:21.440> lean<00:05:21.650> towards<00:05:22.130> the<00:05:22.310> extract<00:05:22.670> on

00:05:22.780 --> 00:05:22.790 
going to lean towards the extract on

00:05:22.790 --> 00:05:24.220 
going to lean towards the extract on
that<00:05:22.910> one<00:05:23.030> I'm<00:05:23.180> not<00:05:23.210> may<00:05:23.540> change<00:05:23.780> my<00:05:23.870> mind<00:05:23.960> but

00:05:24.220 --> 00:05:24.230 
that one I'm not may change my mind but

00:05:24.230 --> 00:05:26.620 
that one I'm not may change my mind but
that's<00:05:24.470> why<00:05:24.590> i'm<00:05:24.680> elina<00:05:24.830> right<00:05:25.100> now<00:05:25.250> and<00:05:25.630> we

00:05:26.620 --> 00:05:26.630 
that's why i'm elina right now and we

00:05:26.630 --> 00:05:29.410 
that's why i'm elina right now and we
got<00:05:26.780> this<00:05:26.960> one<00:05:27.140> in<00:05:27.170> the<00:05:27.260> cake<00:05:27.500> and<00:05:28.240> like<00:05:29.240> I<00:05:29.300> said

00:05:29.410 --> 00:05:29.420 
got this one in the cake and like I said

00:05:29.420 --> 00:05:30.700 
got this one in the cake and like I said
we've<00:05:29.660> got<00:05:29.690> one<00:05:30.020> batch<00:05:30.200> going<00:05:30.470> in<00:05:30.620> the

00:05:30.700 --> 00:05:30.710 
we've got one batch going in the

00:05:30.710 --> 00:05:32.620 
we've got one batch going in the
fermentation<00:05:31.340> chamber<00:05:31.640> it's<00:05:31.820> actually<00:05:32.330> a

00:05:36.770 --> 00:05:38.920 
experimental while I'm still learning
all<00:05:37.100> the<00:05:37.370> techniques<00:05:38.150> for<00:05:38.300> all<00:05:38.480> grain<00:05:38.720> I

00:05:38.920 --> 00:05:38.930 
all the techniques for all grain I

00:05:38.930 --> 00:05:41.350 
all the techniques for all grain I
wanted<00:05:39.770> to<00:05:39.950> get<00:05:40.190> a<00:05:40.250> couple<00:05:40.460> brews<00:05:41.000> under<00:05:41.270> my

00:05:41.350 --> 00:05:41.360 
wanted to get a couple brews under my

on<00:05:46.490> the<00:05:46.580> how-to<00:05:46.700> just<00:05:46.940> because<00:05:47.090> I<00:05:47.150> don't<00:05:47.240> want

00:05:47.320 --> 00:05:47.330 
on the how-to just because I don't want

00:05:47.330 --> 00:05:48.460 
on the how-to just because I don't want
to<00:05:47.480> make<00:05:47.570> sure<00:05:47.600> that<00:05:47.810> I<00:05:47.840> know<00:05:47.960> everything<00:05:48.350> that

00:05:48.460 --> 00:05:48.470 
to make sure that I know everything that
