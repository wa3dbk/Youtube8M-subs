00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:21.090 
pretend farmer girl and this is the

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:24.320 
pretend farmer girl and this is the
marshmallow<00:01:21.710> infused<00:01:22.710> vodka<00:01:23.280> it<00:01:24.060> was<00:01:24.180> only

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:24.330 
marshmallow infused vodka it was only

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:26.750 
marshmallow infused vodka it was only
supposed<00:01:24.540> to<00:01:24.780> sit<00:01:25.050> for<00:01:25.440> 24<00:01:25.740> hours<00:01:26.280> but<00:01:26.580> I've

00:01:26.750 --> 00:01:26.760 
supposed to sit for 24 hours but I've

00:01:26.760 --> 00:01:29.359 
supposed to sit for 24 hours but I've
been<00:01:27.030> too<00:01:27.240> busy<00:01:27.450> so<00:01:27.840> it's<00:01:27.990> been<00:01:28.310> probably<00:01:29.310> a

00:01:29.359 --> 00:01:29.369 
been too busy so it's been probably a

00:01:29.369 --> 00:01:33.350 
been too busy so it's been probably a
little<00:01:29.580> over<00:01:29.940> 48<00:01:30.450> maybe<00:01:30.930> 48<00:01:31.350> so<00:01:32.250> I<00:01:32.670> imagine<00:01:32.940> the

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:33.360 
little over 48 maybe 48 so I imagine the

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:37.070 
little over 48 maybe 48 so I imagine the
marshmallows<00:01:33.960> are<00:01:34.310> breaking<00:01:35.310> down<00:01:35.580> more<00:01:36.080> the

00:01:37.070 --> 00:01:37.080 
marshmallows are breaking down more the

00:01:37.080 --> 00:01:39.890 
marshmallows are breaking down more the
longer<00:01:37.410> they<00:01:37.530> sit<00:01:37.820> so<00:01:38.820> I<00:01:38.850> also<00:01:39.360> don't<00:01:39.600> have<00:01:39.720> any

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:39.900 
longer they sit so I also don't have any

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:42.290 
longer they sit so I also don't have any
cheesecloth<00:01:40.350> so<00:01:41.040> I<00:01:41.070> have<00:01:41.460> a<00:01:41.490> coffee<00:01:42.000> filter

00:01:42.290 --> 00:01:42.300 
cheesecloth so I have a coffee filter

00:01:42.300 --> 00:01:44.780 
cheesecloth so I have a coffee filter
that's<00:01:42.720> wet<00:01:42.990> so<00:01:43.229> it<00:01:43.290> won't<00:01:43.470> soak<00:01:44.130> up<00:01:44.310> the<00:01:44.430> vodka

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:44.790 
that's wet so it won't soak up the vodka

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:47.210 
that's wet so it won't soak up the vodka
and<00:01:45.060> I'm<00:01:45.509> just<00:01:45.720> gonna<00:01:45.840> pour<00:01:46.110> it<00:01:46.200> in<00:01:46.320> and<00:01:46.530> and

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:47.220 
and I'm just gonna pour it in and and

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:48.950 
and I'm just gonna pour it in and and
see<00:01:47.610> what<00:01:47.759> we<00:01:47.880> get

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:48.960 
see what we get

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:50.740 
see what we get
the<00:01:49.170> other<00:01:49.320> thing<00:01:49.590> is<00:01:49.770> there's<00:01:50.040> a<00:01:50.130> lot<00:01:50.310> of<00:01:50.460> them

00:01:50.740 --> 00:01:50.750 
the other thing is there's a lot of them

00:01:50.750 --> 00:01:53.450 
the other thing is there's a lot of them
when<00:01:51.750> I<00:01:51.780> was<00:01:51.930> shaking<00:01:52.320> it<00:01:52.470> up<00:01:52.619> you<00:01:53.250> know<00:01:53.369> of

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:53.460 
when I was shaking it up you know of

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:55.070 
when I was shaking it up you know of
course<00:01:53.670> it<00:01:53.820> would<00:01:53.910> turn<00:01:54.119> white<00:01:54.420> because<00:01:54.810> the

00:01:55.070 --> 00:01:55.080 
course it would turn white because the

00:01:55.080 --> 00:01:58.609 
course it would turn white because the
the<00:01:55.800> sediment<00:01:56.310> would<00:01:56.490> mix<00:01:57.450> in<00:01:57.690> so<00:01:58.200> I<00:01:58.229> don't

00:01:58.609 --> 00:01:58.619 
the sediment would mix in so I don't

00:01:58.619 --> 00:01:59.990 
the sediment would mix in so I don't
know<00:01:58.740> how<00:01:58.860> much<00:01:59.009> of<00:01:59.160> that<00:01:59.190> will<00:01:59.429> strain<00:01:59.789> out

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:00.000 
know how much of that will strain out

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:08.990 
know how much of that will strain out
but<00:02:00.960> we'll<00:02:01.319> see

00:02:08.990 --> 00:02:09.000 

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:12.740 

I<00:02:09.380> think<00:02:10.380> it's<00:02:10.530> gonna<00:02:10.710> have<00:02:10.950> a<00:02:11.010> plop<00:02:11.450> pop<00:02:12.450> up

00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:12.750 
I think it's gonna have a plop pop up

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:42.300 
I think it's gonna have a plop pop up
his<00:02:13.500> fizz

00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:42.310

00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:26.410 
it's all strained all right here it is I

00:03:26.410 --> 00:03:28.920 
it's all strained all right here it is I
haven't<00:03:26.980> tasted<00:03:27.220> it<00:03:27.519> yet<00:03:27.580> I'm<00:03:28.330> actually<00:03:28.690> I

00:03:28.920 --> 00:03:28.930 
haven't tasted it yet I'm actually I

00:03:28.930 --> 00:03:31.020 
haven't tasted it yet I'm actually I
tasted<00:03:29.260> just<00:03:29.440> a<00:03:29.530> little<00:03:29.800> bit<00:03:30.010> on<00:03:30.550> my<00:03:30.670> finger

00:03:31.020 --> 00:03:31.030 
tasted just a little bit on my finger

00:03:31.030 --> 00:03:33.660 
tasted just a little bit on my finger
and<00:03:31.300> it<00:03:31.480> had<00:03:32.080> a<00:03:32.110> little<00:03:32.560> bit<00:03:32.739> of<00:03:32.890> a<00:03:33.010> hint<00:03:33.370> of

00:03:33.660 --> 00:03:33.670 
and it had a little bit of a hint of

00:03:33.670 --> 00:03:35.220 
and it had a little bit of a hint of
marshmallow<00:03:34.269> so<00:03:34.540> I<00:03:34.569> guess<00:03:34.780> that's<00:03:34.930> what<00:03:35.140> we

00:03:35.220 --> 00:03:35.230 
marshmallow so I guess that's what we

00:03:35.230 --> 00:03:38.699 
marshmallow so I guess that's what we
want<00:03:35.470> and<00:03:36.690> these<00:03:37.690> this<00:03:38.050> is<00:03:38.200> the<00:03:38.290> rest<00:03:38.500> of<00:03:38.620> the

00:03:38.699 --> 00:03:38.709 
want and these this is the rest of the

00:03:38.709 --> 00:03:40.530 
want and these this is the rest of the
marshmallows<00:03:39.250> I<00:03:39.459> just<00:03:39.819> wanted<00:03:40.060> to<00:03:40.209> see<00:03:40.390> what

00:03:40.530 --> 00:03:40.540

00:03:40.540 --> 00:03:42.479 
marshmallows I just wanted to see what
they<00:03:40.660> would<00:03:40.810> do<00:03:40.989> but<00:03:41.470> I<00:03:41.800> think<00:03:42.220> they're<00:03:42.340> going

00:03:42.479 --> 00:03:42.489 
they would do but I think they're going

00:03:42.489 --> 00:03:48.000 
they would do but I think they're going
in<00:03:42.610> the<00:03:42.670> trash<00:03:43.200> so<00:03:44.250> anyway<00:03:46.440> this<00:03:47.440> is<00:03:47.620> pretend

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:48.010

00:03:56.070 --> 00:03:56.080 
so I was gonna just toss this so but my

00:03:56.080 --> 00:03:58.170 
so I was gonna just toss this so but my
husband<00:03:56.410> came<00:03:56.560> in<00:03:56.769> and<00:03:57.130> was<00:03:57.760> going<00:03:57.880> to<00:03:57.940> taste

00:03:58.170 --> 00:03:58.180 
husband came in and was going to taste

00:03:58.180 --> 00:04:00.120 
husband came in and was going to taste
the<00:03:58.329> vodka<00:03:58.480> I<00:03:58.959> decided<00:03:59.319> to<00:03:59.560> taste<00:03:59.799> a

00:04:00.120 --> 00:04:00.130 
the vodka I decided to taste a

00:04:00.130 --> 00:04:04.020 
the vodka I decided to taste a
marshmallow<00:04:00.670> first<00:04:01.209> and<00:04:01.860> basically<00:04:03.030> it's

00:04:04.020 --> 00:04:04.030 
marshmallow first and basically it's

00:04:04.030 --> 00:04:06.150 
marshmallow first and basically it's
probably<00:04:04.690> equivalent<00:04:05.319> to<00:04:05.769> a<00:04:05.799> very<00:04:06.099> very

00:04:06.150 --> 00:04:06.160 
probably equivalent to a very very

00:04:06.160 --> 00:04:10.860 
probably equivalent to a very very
strong<00:04:07.440> jello<00:04:08.440> shooter<00:04:08.860> type<00:04:09.400> taste<00:04:09.870> so

00:04:10.860 --> 00:04:10.870 
strong jello shooter type taste so

00:04:10.870 --> 00:04:14.850 
strong jello shooter type taste so
anyway<00:04:11.640> the<00:04:12.640> I<00:04:13.450> guess<00:04:13.870> if<00:04:14.079> you<00:04:14.290> were<00:04:14.440> making

00:04:14.850 --> 00:04:14.860 
anyway the I guess if you were making

00:04:14.860 --> 00:04:16.379 
anyway the I guess if you were making
some<00:04:14.890> and<00:04:15.310> having<00:04:15.459> a<00:04:15.640> party<00:04:15.940> you<00:04:16.030> could<00:04:16.150> set

00:04:16.379 --> 00:04:16.389 
some and having a party you could set

00:04:16.389 --> 00:04:17.789 
some and having a party you could set
this<00:04:16.540> out<00:04:16.750> and<00:04:16.870> let<00:04:17.019> people<00:04:17.200> scoop<00:04:17.560> them<00:04:17.739> up

00:04:17.789 --> 00:04:17.799 
this out and let people scoop them up

00:04:17.799 --> 00:04:20.310 
this out and let people scoop them up
instead<00:04:18.160> of<00:04:18.220> jello<00:04:18.489> shooters<00:04:18.780> anyway<00:04:19.780> there

00:04:20.310 --> 00:04:20.320 
instead of jello shooters anyway there

00:04:20.320 --> 00:04:23.430 
instead of jello shooters anyway there
you<00:04:20.500> go<00:04:21.030> first<00:04:22.030> attempt<00:04:22.900> at<00:04:23.020> marshmallow

00:04:23.430 --> 00:04:23.440 
you go first attempt at marshmallow

00:04:23.440 --> 00:04:25.200
