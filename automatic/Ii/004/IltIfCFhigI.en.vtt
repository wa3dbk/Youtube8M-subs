00:00:00.530 --> 00:00:11.150
 so I took 

00:00:03.980 --> 00:00:11.150
 removed the facial pebbles really 

00:00:11.450 --> 00:00:20.369
 the seller did not deceive here 

00:00:14.639 --> 00:00:30.570
 from the edge we'll see we see cheung type 

00:00:20.369 --> 00:00:36.320
 sau funk some kind of samsung i'm to 

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:40.050
 Unfortunately I can not make out to be with you 

00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:45.629
 something here we have this is probably the essence 

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:49.710
 complicated heaped microprocessor here 

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:50.840
 visually visible here implemented 

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:53.370
 two channels 

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:59.180
 control and temperature to us further 

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:59.180
 handled which everyone knows 

00:00:59.420 --> 00:01:03.660
 connectors are traditionally flooded with Chinese 

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:06.750
 snot 

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:14.340
 somewhere reds somewhere 

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:18.960
 Svetka light yellow kimi inside us 

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:19.880
 worth the transformer I expected from you 

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:22.799
 equally attack 

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:25.590
 physical dimensions are smaller but in principle 

00:01:22.799 --> 00:01:30.540
 it absolutely suits you means 3 

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:31.140
 winding it gives out 10 and 4 volts 24 and from 

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:36.110
 me 

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:39.110
 view does not change 34 and twenty six 

00:01:36.110 --> 00:01:39.110
 volt 

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:47.310
 in this case, the general Chinese 

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:48.119
 devices can be divided into bad and 

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:49.979
 good ones 

00:01:48.119 --> 00:01:57.360
 here it is the device can be said that 

00:01:49.979 --> 00:02:00.320
 nothing is so normally assembled though that's not 

00:01:57.360 --> 00:02:06.030
 you can see the video camera can be seen 

00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:09.630
 fingerprints of any pension 

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:15.440
 I can not see and I am very even 

00:02:09.630 --> 00:02:17.519
 clearly seen in principle 

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:22.799
 the inside of this board is nothing 

00:02:17.519 --> 00:02:25.049
 different from what I saw to know it 

00:02:22.799 --> 00:02:30.769
 in other video reviews of similar 

00:02:25.049 --> 00:02:34.890
 stations it can all be removed 

00:02:30.769 --> 00:02:37.730
 Plato can be unfastened any cool 

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:37.730
 no wires 

00:02:42.340 --> 00:02:49.240
 With this it is not clear why for a soldering iron 

00:02:45.350 --> 00:02:57.380
 humor was not used for the heat gun 

00:02:49.240 --> 00:03:03.500
 so such a cup is a non-removable cable empty 

00:02:57.380 --> 00:03:08.720
 virtually no soldering places 

00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:12.080
 Forget all remembered video to do not know 

00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:14.290
 there is no visible on the record that's all seeming 

00:03:12.080 --> 00:03:20.420
 empty instead 

00:03:14.290 --> 00:03:24.010
 the rest of the buttons are sealed all sorts of different 

00:03:20.420 --> 00:03:24.010
 other elements
