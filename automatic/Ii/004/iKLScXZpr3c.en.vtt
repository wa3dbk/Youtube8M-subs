00:00:05.470 --> 00:00:08.890 

I'm<00:00:06.470> in<00:00:06.740> my<00:00:06.920> studio<00:00:07.189> with<00:00:07.730> my<00:00:07.940> drawing<00:00:08.299> pad<00:00:08.389> on

00:00:08.890 --> 00:00:08.900 
I'm in my studio with my drawing pad on

00:00:08.900 --> 00:00:12.610 
I'm in my studio with my drawing pad on
the<00:00:09.080> easel<00:00:09.850> usually<00:00:10.850> I<00:00:10.879> would<00:00:11.240> draw<00:00:11.510> with<00:00:12.500> the

00:00:12.610 --> 00:00:12.620 
the easel usually I would draw with the

00:00:12.620 --> 00:00:15.009 
the easel usually I would draw with the
pad<00:00:12.860> flat<00:00:13.340> on<00:00:13.580> the<00:00:13.820> drawing<00:00:14.179> table<00:00:14.599> off<00:00:14.750> to<00:00:14.929> the

00:00:15.009 --> 00:00:15.019 
pad flat on the drawing table off to the

00:00:15.019 --> 00:00:17.050 
pad flat on the drawing table off to the
right<00:00:15.230> it<00:00:16.130> gives<00:00:16.340> a<00:00:16.460> little<00:00:16.670> better<00:00:16.849> control

00:00:17.050 --> 00:00:17.060 
right it gives a little better control

00:00:17.060 --> 00:00:19.240 
right it gives a little better control
if<00:00:17.720> you<00:00:17.869> can<00:00:18.050> put<00:00:18.259> your<00:00:18.410> elbow<00:00:18.740> on<00:00:18.770> the<00:00:19.099> table

00:00:19.240 --> 00:00:19.250 
if you can put your elbow on the table

00:00:19.250 --> 00:00:22.060 
if you can put your elbow on the table
while<00:00:19.640> you're<00:00:19.789> drawing<00:00:20.060> if<00:00:20.330> you<00:00:20.449> need<00:00:20.600> to<00:00:21.070> but

00:00:22.060 --> 00:00:22.070 
while you're drawing if you need to but

00:00:22.070 --> 00:00:26.170 
while you're drawing if you need to but
this<00:00:22.369> was<00:00:22.609> easier<00:00:23.029> to<00:00:23.090> make<00:00:23.630> the<00:00:23.750> video<00:00:23.960> so<00:00:25.180> I'm

00:00:26.170 --> 00:00:26.180 
this was easier to make the video so I'm

00:00:26.180 --> 00:00:29.230 
this was easier to make the video so I'm
using<00:00:26.510> calligraphy<00:00:27.500> pens<00:00:27.800> these<00:00:28.609> are<00:00:28.850> Zig

00:00:29.230 --> 00:00:29.240 
using calligraphy pens these are Zig

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:32.950 
using calligraphy pens these are Zig
memory<00:00:30.250> calligraphy<00:00:31.250> markers<00:00:31.760> and<00:00:32.029> they<00:00:32.720> come

00:00:32.950 --> 00:00:32.960 
memory calligraphy markers and they come

00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:36.190 
memory calligraphy markers and they come
in<00:00:33.320> O<00:00:33.970> forty<00:00:34.970> or<00:00:35.090> so<00:00:35.239> different<00:00:35.420> colors<00:00:35.930> I

00:00:36.190 --> 00:00:36.200 
in O forty or so different colors I

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:38.979 
in O forty or so different colors I
bought<00:00:36.860> a<00:00:36.890> whole<00:00:37.100> set<00:00:37.340> of<00:00:37.370> colors<00:00:37.820> and<00:00:38.120> then<00:00:38.899> I

00:00:38.979 --> 00:00:38.989 
bought a whole set of colors and then I

00:00:38.989 --> 00:00:40.780 
bought a whole set of colors and then I
replaced<00:00:39.410> them<00:00:39.620> as<00:00:39.739> I<00:00:39.860> need<00:00:40.070> to<00:00:40.250> as<00:00:40.399> they<00:00:40.550> dry

00:00:40.780 --> 00:00:40.790 
replaced them as I need to as they dry

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:43.750 
replaced them as I need to as they dry
out<00:00:40.820> they<00:00:41.290> have<00:00:42.290> two<00:00:42.530> sides<00:00:42.860> two<00:00:43.250> ends<00:00:43.579> to

00:00:43.750 --> 00:00:43.760 
out they have two sides two ends to

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:47.470 
out they have two sides two ends to
these<00:00:44.050> markers<00:00:45.050> one<00:00:45.590> has<00:00:46.010> a<00:00:46.460> thin<00:00:46.790> point<00:00:47.239> and

00:00:47.470 --> 00:00:47.480 
these markers one has a thin point and

00:00:47.480 --> 00:00:50.260 
these markers one has a thin point and
one<00:00:47.660> has<00:00:47.870> a<00:00:47.899> thick<00:00:48.230> point<00:00:48.500> I<00:00:48.739> usually<00:00:49.640> use<00:00:50.000> the

00:00:50.260 --> 00:00:50.270 
one has a thick point I usually use the

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:52.810 
one has a thick point I usually use the
thick<00:00:50.660> point<00:00:50.960> mostly<00:00:51.440> and<00:00:51.680> by<00:00:52.010> turning<00:00:52.520> the

00:00:52.810 --> 00:00:52.820 
thick point mostly and by turning the

00:00:52.820 --> 00:00:55.540 
thick point mostly and by turning the
pen<00:00:53.059> as<00:00:53.329> you<00:00:53.960> move<00:00:54.170> it<00:00:54.350> you<00:00:54.559> can<00:00:54.949> change<00:00:55.309> the

00:00:55.540 --> 00:00:55.550 
pen as you move it you can change the

00:00:55.550 --> 00:00:57.700 
pen as you move it you can change the
thickness<00:00:55.699> of<00:00:56.030> the<00:00:56.149> line<00:00:56.390> so<00:00:57.110> you'll<00:00:57.260> see<00:00:57.500> that

00:00:57.700 --> 00:00:57.710 
thickness of the line so you'll see that

00:00:57.710 --> 00:00:59.430 
thickness of the line so you'll see that
even<00:00:57.980> though<00:00:58.070> I'm<00:00:58.190> using<00:00:58.219> the<00:00:58.760> thick<00:00:59.000> end

00:00:59.430 --> 00:00:59.440 
even though I'm using the thick end

00:00:59.440 --> 00:01:03.790 
even though I'm using the thick end
sometimes<00:01:00.440> I<00:01:00.590> get<00:01:00.800> a<00:01:00.829> thick<00:01:01.219> flat<00:01:02.530> mark<00:01:03.530> and

00:01:03.790 --> 00:01:03.800 
sometimes I get a thick flat mark and

00:01:03.800 --> 00:01:06.279 
sometimes I get a thick flat mark and
other<00:01:03.949> times<00:01:04.220> I<00:01:04.430> get<00:01:04.610> a<00:01:04.640> thin<00:01:04.940> line<00:01:05.750> depending

00:01:06.279 --> 00:01:06.289 
other times I get a thin line depending

00:01:06.289 --> 00:01:08.289 
other times I get a thin line depending
on<00:01:06.410> how<00:01:06.590> I<00:01:06.619> move<00:01:06.920> the<00:01:06.950> pen<00:01:07.250> so<00:01:07.520> it's<00:01:08.060> quite

00:01:08.289 --> 00:01:08.299 
on how I move the pen so it's quite

00:01:08.299 --> 00:01:12.490 
on how I move the pen so it's quite
versatile<00:01:09.010> so<00:01:10.010> I<00:01:10.400> began<00:01:11.000> just<00:01:11.270> by<00:01:11.450> putting<00:01:12.260> in

00:01:12.490 --> 00:01:12.500 
versatile so I began just by putting in

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:15.700 
versatile so I began just by putting in
some<00:01:12.670> you<00:01:13.670> know<00:01:13.790> beginning<00:01:14.150> colors<00:01:14.630> and<00:01:14.990> I

00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:15.710 
some you know beginning colors and I

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:17.649 
some you know beginning colors and I
this<00:01:15.770> is<00:01:16.130> how<00:01:16.159> I<00:01:16.280> tend<00:01:16.640> to<00:01:16.700> work<00:01:16.939> I<00:01:17.180> don't<00:01:17.299> work

00:01:17.649 --> 00:01:17.659 
this is how I tend to work I don't work

00:01:17.659 --> 00:01:20.649 
this is how I tend to work I don't work
on<00:01:17.810> one<00:01:18.070> image<00:01:19.070> or<00:01:19.610> one<00:01:19.759> place<00:01:20.030> on<00:01:20.270> the<00:01:20.360> drawing

00:01:20.649 --> 00:01:20.659 
on one image or one place on the drawing

00:01:20.659 --> 00:01:24.640 
on one image or one place on the drawing
but<00:01:20.900> I<00:01:20.930> work<00:01:21.200> overall<00:01:21.530> and<00:01:22.540> I'll<00:01:23.540> work<00:01:24.470> with

00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:24.650 
but I work overall and I'll work with

00:01:24.650 --> 00:01:26.800 
but I work overall and I'll work with
one<00:01:24.830> color<00:01:25.070> for<00:01:25.340> a<00:01:25.430> while<00:01:25.670> and<00:01:26.150> then<00:01:26.420> I'll<00:01:26.600> put

00:01:26.800 --> 00:01:26.810 
one color for a while and then I'll put

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:28.840 
one color for a while and then I'll put
it<00:01:26.900> down<00:01:26.930> and<00:01:27.259> pick<00:01:27.380> up<00:01:27.530> another<00:01:27.650> color<00:01:28.009> so

00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:28.850 
it down and pick up another color so

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:32.230 
it down and pick up another color so
I've<00:01:29.000> got<00:01:29.210> my<00:01:29.420> basic<00:01:29.869> blossoms<00:01:30.409> in<00:01:30.619> there<00:01:31.240> with

00:01:32.230 --> 00:01:32.240 
I've got my basic blossoms in there with

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:35.469 
I've got my basic blossoms in there with
the<00:01:32.360> yellow<00:01:32.689> and<00:01:33.020> the<00:01:33.250> pink<00:01:34.250> and<00:01:34.460> lavender<00:01:35.150> and

00:01:35.469 --> 00:01:35.479 
the yellow and the pink and lavender and

00:01:35.479 --> 00:01:38.440 
the yellow and the pink and lavender and
violet<00:01:35.960> now<00:01:36.560> I<00:01:36.590> found<00:01:36.920> a<00:01:37.070> strong<00:01:37.369> red<00:01:37.820> because

00:01:38.440 --> 00:01:38.450 
violet now I found a strong red because

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:40.539 
violet now I found a strong red because
I<00:01:38.479> think<00:01:38.810> it<00:01:38.990> needs<00:01:39.229> some<00:01:39.409> really<00:01:40.280> strong

00:01:40.539 --> 00:01:40.549 
I think it needs some really strong

00:01:40.549 --> 00:01:44.020 
I think it needs some really strong
color<00:01:40.820> here<00:01:41.290> and<00:01:42.640> sometimes<00:01:43.640> I'll<00:01:43.790> try<00:01:44.000> out

00:01:44.020 --> 00:01:44.030 
color here and sometimes I'll try out

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:45.789 
color here and sometimes I'll try out
the<00:01:44.329> color<00:01:44.540> first<00:01:44.869> on<00:01:45.110> a<00:01:45.140> piece<00:01:45.320> of<00:01:45.380> scrap

00:01:45.789 --> 00:01:45.799

00:01:45.799 --> 00:01:47.530 
the color first on a piece of scrap
paper<00:01:45.829> just<00:01:46.579> to<00:01:46.700> make<00:01:46.820> sure<00:01:46.970> I<00:01:47.060> get<00:01:47.240> the<00:01:47.329> color

00:01:47.530 --> 00:01:47.540 
paper just to make sure I get the color

00:01:47.540 --> 00:01:50.139 
paper just to make sure I get the color
I<00:01:47.600> want<00:01:48.100> other<00:01:49.100> times<00:01:49.460> I'll<00:01:49.640> pick<00:01:49.820> it<00:01:49.850> up<00:01:50.000> and

00:01:50.139 --> 00:01:50.149 
I want other times I'll pick it up and

00:01:50.149 --> 00:01:54.039 
I want other times I'll pick it up and
find<00:01:50.390> out<00:01:50.540> it's<00:01:51.200> not<00:01:51.439> the<00:01:51.590> color<00:01:51.740> I<00:01:51.829> want<00:01:53.049> also

find out it's not the color I want also

00:01:54.049 --> 00:01:55.929 
find out it's not the color I want also
sometimes<00:01:54.439> these<00:01:54.590> pens<00:01:54.890> dry<00:01:55.220> out<00:01:55.430> a<00:01:55.460> bit<00:01:55.549> and

00:01:55.929 --> 00:01:55.939 
sometimes these pens dry out a bit and

00:01:55.939 --> 00:01:57.399 
sometimes these pens dry out a bit and
then<00:01:56.149> you<00:01:56.270> get<00:01:56.390> a<00:01:56.420> more<00:01:56.659> of<00:01:56.689> a<00:01:56.869> you<00:01:57.380> know

00:01:57.399 --> 00:01:57.409 
then you get a more of a you know

00:01:57.409 --> 00:02:01.330 
then you get a more of a you know
lighter<00:01:58.360> drier<00:01:59.360> color<00:01:59.780> other<00:02:00.710> times<00:02:01.100> you'll

00:02:01.330 --> 00:02:01.340 
lighter drier color other times you'll

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:04.060 
lighter drier color other times you'll
get<00:02:01.520> a<00:02:01.549> nice<00:02:01.759> rich<00:02:02.090> thick<00:02:02.509> color<00:02:03.049> there<00:02:03.950> I'm

00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:04.070

00:02:56.480 --> 00:02:56.490 
little bit and of course I've speeded

00:02:56.490 --> 00:02:58.820 
little bit and of course I've speeded
this<00:02:56.640> up<00:02:56.820> and<00:02:56.970> cut<00:02:57.180> out<00:02:57.330> lots<00:02:57.600> of<00:02:57.750> it

00:02:58.820 --> 00:02:58.830 
this up and cut out lots of it

00:02:58.830 --> 00:03:00.830 
this up and cut out lots of it
I<00:02:58.890> haven't<00:02:59.490> actually<00:02:59.610> speeded<00:03:00.209> up<00:03:00.330> the<00:03:00.540> actual

00:03:00.830 --> 00:03:00.840 
I haven't actually speeded up the actual

00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:02.600 
I haven't actually speeded up the actual
drawing<00:03:01.200> but<00:03:01.530> I<00:03:01.560> have<00:03:01.740> cut<00:03:01.980> out<00:03:02.130> all<00:03:02.430> the

00:03:02.600 --> 00:03:02.610 
drawing but I have cut out all the

00:03:02.610 --> 00:03:04.970 
drawing but I have cut out all the
places<00:03:02.730> where<00:03:03.180> I'm<00:03:03.300> not<00:03:03.420> doing<00:03:03.750> anything<00:03:03.990> so

00:03:04.970 --> 00:03:04.980 
places where I'm not doing anything so

00:03:04.980 --> 00:03:08.330 
places where I'm not doing anything so
it<00:03:05.310> looks<00:03:05.580> a<00:03:05.700> good<00:03:05.730> speed<00:03:06.209> it<00:03:06.360> up<00:03:07.070> so<00:03:08.070> here<00:03:08.250> I'm

00:03:08.330 --> 00:03:08.340 
it looks a good speed it up so here I'm

00:03:08.340 --> 00:03:10.090 
it looks a good speed it up so here I'm
just<00:03:08.370> putting<00:03:08.550> in<00:03:08.880> the<00:03:09.000> final<00:03:09.330> touches<00:03:09.570> now

00:03:10.090 --> 00:03:10.100 
just putting in the final touches now

00:03:10.100 --> 00:03:13.520 
just putting in the final touches now
getting<00:03:11.100> it<00:03:11.510> to<00:03:12.510> the<00:03:12.540> point<00:03:12.840> where<00:03:13.350> I<00:03:13.380> feel

00:03:13.520 --> 00:03:13.530 
getting it to the point where I feel

00:03:13.530 --> 00:03:16.580 
getting it to the point where I feel
that<00:03:14.000> it's<00:03:15.000> good<00:03:15.270> to<00:03:15.420> go<00:03:15.570> and<00:03:15.840> I<00:03:16.170> think<00:03:16.230> we'll

00:03:16.580 --> 00:03:16.590 
that it's good to go and I think we'll

00:03:16.590 --> 00:03:24.590 
that it's good to go and I think we'll
be<00:03:16.880> finished<00:03:17.880> here<00:03:18.120> in<00:03:18.980> a<00:03:20.209> little<00:03:21.209> bit<00:03:21.420> I<00:03:23.600> guess

00:03:24.590 --> 00:03:24.600 
be finished here in a little bit I guess

00:03:24.600 --> 00:03:28.370 
be finished here in a little bit I guess
I<00:03:25.019> decided<00:03:25.170> it<00:03:25.650> needed<00:03:25.680> more<00:03:27.110> leaves<00:03:28.110> at<00:03:28.350> the

00:03:28.370 --> 00:03:28.380 
I decided it needed more leaves at the

00:03:28.380 --> 00:03:30.170 
I decided it needed more leaves at the
bottom<00:03:28.470> give<00:03:29.220> a<00:03:29.250> little<00:03:29.519> the<00:03:29.700> bottom<00:03:30.030> a<00:03:30.090> little

00:03:30.170 --> 00:03:30.180 
bottom give a little the bottom a little

00:03:30.180 --> 00:03:32.060 
bottom give a little the bottom a little
more<00:03:30.450> weight<00:03:30.690> because<00:03:30.930> the<00:03:31.200> top<00:03:31.410> has<00:03:31.650> all<00:03:31.920> the

00:03:32.060 --> 00:03:32.070 
more weight because the top has all the

00:03:32.070 --> 00:03:34.070 
more weight because the top has all the
weight<00:03:32.220> so<00:03:32.940> I'm<00:03:33.000> just<00:03:33.209> trying<00:03:33.450> to<00:03:33.480> give<00:03:33.630> me<00:03:33.750> if

00:03:34.070 --> 00:03:34.080 
weight so I'm just trying to give me if

00:03:34.080 --> 00:03:35.360 
weight so I'm just trying to give me if
the<00:03:34.230> bottom<00:03:34.530> a<00:03:34.590> little<00:03:34.680> more<00:03:34.920> weight<00:03:35.100> for<00:03:35.130> a

00:03:35.360 --> 00:03:35.370 
the bottom a little more weight for a

00:03:35.370 --> 00:03:36.949 
the bottom a little more weight for a
little<00:03:35.519> more<00:03:35.640> balance<00:03:36.060> and<00:03:36.330> it<00:03:36.840> a<00:03:36.930> little

00:03:36.949 --> 00:03:36.959 
little more balance and it a little

00:03:36.959 --> 00:03:40.360 
little more balance and it a little
light<00:03:37.380> lime<00:03:38.280> green<00:03:38.610> there<00:03:38.910> and<00:03:39.120> here<00:03:40.050> it<00:03:40.140> is

00:03:40.360 --> 00:03:40.370 
light lime green there and here it is

00:03:40.370 --> 00:03:43.940 
light lime green there and here it is
the<00:03:41.370> final<00:03:41.730> drawing
