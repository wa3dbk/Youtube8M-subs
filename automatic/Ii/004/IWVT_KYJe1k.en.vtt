00:01:50.910 --> 00:01:50.920 
larger series is over 75 for

00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:53.010 
larger series is over 75 for
and<00:01:51.400> that's<00:01:51.610> inside<00:01:52.090> dimensions<00:01:52.630> on<00:01:52.810> that

00:01:53.010 --> 00:01:53.020 
and that's inside dimensions on that

00:01:53.020 --> 00:01:54.690 
and that's inside dimensions on that
sure<00:01:53.290> so<00:01:53.620> a<00:01:53.650> lot<00:01:53.920> of<00:01:53.950> our<00:01:54.130> competitors<00:01:54.490> will

00:01:54.700 --> 00:01:57.840 
sure so a lot of our competitors will
say<00:01:55.180> 75<00:01:55.990> but<00:01:56.350> that's<00:01:56.560> just<00:01:57.040> a<00:01:57.159> number<00:01:57.310> ours<00:01:57.670> is

00:01:57.840 --> 00:01:57.850 
say 75 but that's just a number ours is

00:01:57.850 --> 00:01:59.460 
say 75 but that's just a number ours is
actually<00:01:58.180> inside<00:01:58.630> dimensions<00:01:59.140> versus

00:01:59.460 --> 00:01:59.470 
actually inside dimensions versus

00:01:59.470 --> 00:02:02.160 
actually inside dimensions versus
outside<00:01:59.800> and<00:02:00.369> then<00:02:00.580> thing<00:02:01.360> with<00:02:01.630> a<00:02:01.690> Cadillac
