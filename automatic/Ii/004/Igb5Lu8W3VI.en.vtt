00:01:39.340 --> 00:01:39.350 
Google Analytics code so in our example

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:40.990 
Google Analytics code so in our example
we<00:01:39.440> have<00:01:39.470> it<00:01:39.770> right<00:01:39.920> here<00:01:40.130> this<00:01:40.310> is<00:01:40.459> the<00:01:40.610> newest

00:01:40.990 --> 00:01:41.000 
we have it right here this is the newest

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:43.930 
we have it right here this is the newest
code<00:01:41.240> the<00:01:41.420> universal<00:01:41.990> code<00:01:42.200> and<00:01:43.009> right<00:01:43.490> now<00:01:43.670> it

00:01:43.930 --> 00:01:43.940 
code the universal code and right now it

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:48.820 
code the universal code and right now it
is<00:01:44.410> September<00:01:45.459> 2013<00:01:46.459> so<00:01:47.229> it's<00:01:48.229> been<00:01:48.440> out<00:01:48.590> for

00:01:48.820 --> 00:01:48.830 
is September 2013 so it's been out for

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:50.559 
is September 2013 so it's been out for
probably<00:01:48.950> quite<00:01:49.550> a<00:01:49.610> few<00:01:49.880> months<00:01:50.060> now<00:01:50.330> maybe

00:01:50.559 --> 00:01:50.569 
probably quite a few months now maybe

00:01:50.569 --> 00:01:53.800 
probably quite a few months now maybe
maybe<00:01:50.990> six<00:01:51.410> months<00:01:51.709> or<00:01:51.860> so<00:01:52.009> so<00:01:52.970> what<00:01:53.390> we<00:01:53.509> do<00:01:53.720> is

00:01:53.800 --> 00:01:53.810 
maybe six months or so so what we do is

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:57.550 
maybe six months or so so what we do is
we<00:01:53.990> copy<00:01:54.500> the<00:01:54.860> entire<00:01:55.039> script<00:01:55.929> copy<00:01:56.929> go<00:01:57.350> back

00:01:57.550 --> 00:01:57.560 
we copy the entire script copy go back

00:01:57.560 --> 00:02:00.370 
we copy the entire script copy go back
to<00:01:57.709> the<00:01:57.860> system<00:01:58.789> and<00:01:59.119> configuration<00:01:59.959> right

00:02:00.370 --> 00:02:00.380 
to the system and configuration right

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:03.370 
to the system and configuration right
here<00:02:00.619> and<00:02:00.800> then<00:02:01.789> we<00:02:02.420> would<00:02:02.569> go<00:02:02.780> under<00:02:03.349> general

00:02:03.370 --> 00:02:03.380 
here and then we would go under general

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:09.119 
here and then we would go under general
to<00:02:04.130> the<00:02:04.160> design<00:02:04.940> tab<00:02:05.300> let's<00:02:05.810> click<00:02:06.140> on<00:02:06.259> that

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:09.129 

00:02:09.129 --> 00:02:11.940 

okay<00:02:09.999> and<00:02:10.239> then<00:02:10.390> we<00:02:10.569> would<00:02:10.659> go<00:02:10.869> to<00:02:10.929> the<00:02:11.140> HTML

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:11.950 
okay and then we would go to the HTML

00:02:11.950 --> 00:02:13.920 
okay and then we would go to the HTML
head<00:02:12.219> to<00:02:12.430> tab<00:02:12.640> right<00:02:12.939> here<00:02:12.969> you<00:02:13.359> can<00:02:13.510> see<00:02:13.780> it

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:13.930 
head to tab right here you can see it
