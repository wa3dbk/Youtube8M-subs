update for a while I will be doing one

00:00:45.070 --> 00:00:49.260 
update for a while I will be doing one
after<00:00:45.520> new<00:00:45.789> year<00:00:46.559> probably<00:00:47.559> at<00:00:48.129> new<00:00:48.610> year<00:00:48.879> I'm

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:49.270 
after new year probably at new year I'm

00:00:49.270 --> 00:00:53.670 
after new year probably at new year I'm
not<00:00:49.449> sure<00:00:50.190> so<00:00:51.840> let's<00:00:52.840> get<00:00:53.050> started<00:00:53.379> this<00:00:53.469> is<00:00:53.649> a

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:53.680 
not sure so let's get started this is a

00:00:53.680 --> 00:00:56.639 
not sure so let's get started this is a
basically<00:00:54.190> base<00:00:54.520> on<00:00:54.789> Hoth<00:00:55.030> it's<00:00:55.440> three<00:00:56.440> base

00:00:56.639 --> 00:00:56.649 
basically base on Hoth it's three base

00:00:56.649 --> 00:01:02.119 
basically base on Hoth it's three base
plates<00:00:56.949> wide<00:00:57.309> and<00:00:59.219> one<00:01:00.219> base<00:01:00.430> plate<00:01:00.789> long<00:01:01.090> so

00:01:02.119 --> 00:01:02.129 
plates wide and one base plate long so

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:05.490 
plates wide and one base plate long so
