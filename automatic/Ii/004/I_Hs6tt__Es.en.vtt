pinky<00:03:51.500> there<00:03:51.739> to<00:03:52.549> take<00:03:53.269> the<00:03:53.510> first<00:03:53.900> string

00:03:54.130 --> 00:03:54.140 
pinky there to take the first string

00:03:54.140 --> 00:03:58.149 
pinky there to take the first string
from<00:03:54.379> fourth<00:03:54.709> to<00:03:54.769> fifth<00:03:54.890> position<00:03:55.390> in<00:03:57.159> second

00:03:58.149 --> 00:03:58.159 
from fourth to fifth position in second

00:03:58.159 --> 00:04:04.050 
from fourth to fifth position in second
position<00:03:58.250> which<00:03:58.760> is<00:03:58.940> now<00:03:59.120> the<00:03:59.180> T<00:03:59.510> cord

00:04:04.050 --> 00:04:04.060 

00:04:04.060 --> 00:04:11.740 

so<00:04:05.060> the<00:04:05.150> whole<00:04:05.360> riff<00:04:05.599> there<00:04:05.900> is

00:04:11.740 --> 00:04:11.750 

00:04:11.750 --> 00:04:13.720 

it's<00:04:12.350> a<00:04:12.410> couple<00:04:12.680> of<00:04:12.770> words<00:04:12.920> on<00:04:13.160> technique

00:04:13.720 --> 00:04:13.730 
it's a couple of words on technique

00:04:13.730 --> 00:04:16.569 
it's a couple of words on technique
really<00:04:14.360> important<00:04:15.110> you'll<00:04:15.260> notice<00:04:15.680> that<00:04:15.890> I'm

00:04:16.569 --> 00:04:16.579 
really important you'll notice that I'm

00:04:16.579 --> 00:04:18.729 
really important you'll notice that I'm
pulling<00:04:17.060> my<00:04:17.239> wrist<00:04:17.480> back<00:04:17.780> and<00:04:18.109> bringing<00:04:18.560> my

00:04:18.729 --> 00:04:18.739 
pulling my wrist back and bringing my

00:04:18.739 --> 00:04:20.800 
pulling my wrist back and bringing my
thumb<00:04:19.010> all<00:04:19.400> the<00:04:19.549> way<00:04:19.670> across<00:04:19.820> the<00:04:20.299> neck<00:04:20.540> here

00:04:20.800 --> 00:04:20.810 
thumb all the way across the neck here

00:04:20.810 --> 00:04:23.040 
thumb all the way across the neck here
and<00:04:21.049> I'm<00:04:21.590> using<00:04:21.829> that<00:04:22.010> as<00:04:22.430> the<00:04:22.460> deadening

00:04:23.040 --> 00:04:23.050 
and I'm using that as the deadening

00:04:23.050 --> 00:04:26.920 
and I'm using that as the deadening
mechanism<00:04:24.050> now<00:04:24.740> your<00:04:25.460> fourth<00:04:25.760> string<00:04:26.150> is<00:04:26.510> your

00:04:26.920 --> 00:04:26.930 
mechanism now your fourth string is your

00:04:26.930 --> 00:04:29.020 
mechanism now your fourth string is your
face<00:04:27.440> note<00:04:27.770> here<00:04:28.100> essentially<00:04:28.580> on<00:04:28.850> these

00:04:29.020 --> 00:04:29.030 
face note here essentially on these

00:04:29.030 --> 00:04:31.570 
face note here essentially on these
cords<00:04:29.480> so<00:04:30.230> that<00:04:30.410> denote<00:04:30.950> is<00:04:31.100> going<00:04:31.280> to<00:04:31.400> ring

00:04:31.570 --> 00:04:31.580 
cords so that denote is going to ring

00:04:31.580 --> 00:04:34.690 
cords so that denote is going to ring
out<00:04:31.730> however<00:04:32.510> you<00:04:32.690> want<00:04:32.840> to<00:04:32.960> control<00:04:33.440> that<00:04:33.710> you

00:04:34.690 --> 00:04:34.700 
out however you want to control that you

00:04:34.700 --> 00:04:36.940 
out however you want to control that you
don't<00:04:34.880> want<00:04:35.060> to<00:04:35.150> let<00:04:35.270> it<00:04:35.420> ring<00:04:35.690> too<00:04:36.230> much<00:04:36.470> or

00:04:36.940 --> 00:04:36.950 
don't want to let it ring too much or

00:04:36.950 --> 00:04:38.350 
don't want to let it ring too much or
it's<00:04:37.070> going<00:04:37.220> to<00:04:37.310> muddy<00:04:37.520> up<00:04:37.610> the<00:04:37.790> courts<00:04:38.240> and

00:04:38.350 --> 00:04:38.360 
it's going to muddy up the courts and

00:04:38.360 --> 00:04:40.570 
it's going to muddy up the courts and
not<00:04:38.480> sound<00:04:38.870> right<00:04:39.170> so<00:04:39.410> you<00:04:39.530> want<00:04:39.560> just<00:04:40.160> the

00:04:40.570 --> 00:04:40.580 
not sound right so you want just the

00:04:40.580 --> 00:04:43.120 
not sound right so you want just the
right<00:04:40.820> amount<00:04:40.880> of<00:04:41.510> that<00:04:41.840> to<00:04:42.560> ring<00:04:42.830> and<00:04:43.100> you

00:04:43.120 --> 00:04:43.130 
right amount of that to ring and you

00:04:43.130 --> 00:04:46.450 
right amount of that to ring and you
control<00:04:43.940> that<00:04:44.020> by<00:04:45.020> rotating<00:04:45.560> your<00:04:45.860> wrist<00:04:46.160> in

00:04:46.450 --> 00:04:46.460 
control that by rotating your wrist in

00:04:46.460 --> 00:04:50.080 
control that by rotating your wrist in
and<00:04:46.730> out<00:04:46.880> and<00:04:48.610> controlling<00:04:49.610> the<00:04:49.730> amount<00:04:49.910> of

00:04:50.080 --> 00:04:50.090 
and out and controlling the amount of

00:04:50.090 --> 00:05:04.030 
and out and controlling the amount of
sustained<00:04:50.600> so<00:05:01.810> we<00:05:02.810> now<00:05:02.960> go<00:05:03.169> down<00:05:03.380> and<00:05:03.710> do<00:05:04.010> it

00:05:04.030 --> 00:05:04.040 
sustained so we now go down and do it

00:05:04.040 --> 00:05:09.880 
sustained so we now go down and do it
here<00:05:04.550> on<00:05:04.669> the<00:05:04.730> a<00:05:05.630> and<00:05:06.260> second<00:05:06.710> position<00:05:08.890> start

00:05:09.880 --> 00:05:09.890 
here on the a and second position start

00:05:09.890 --> 00:05:11.970 
here on the a and second position start
off<00:05:10.040> here<00:05:10.280> we're<00:05:10.430> going<00:05:10.580> to<00:05:10.640> add<00:05:10.820> a<00:05:11.090> c-shape

00:05:11.970 --> 00:05:11.980 
off here we're going to add a c-shape

00:05:11.980 --> 00:05:15.810 
off here we're going to add a c-shape
extension<00:05:12.980> to<00:05:13.160> that<00:05:13.340> the<00:05:13.610> C<00:05:13.820> shape<00:05:14.120> is<00:05:14.390> this

00:05:15.810 --> 00:05:15.820 
extension to that the C shape is this

00:05:15.820 --> 00:05:21.070 
extension to that the C shape is this
we're<00:05:16.820> going<00:05:16.940> to<00:05:17.000> a<00:05:17.300> chord<00:05:19.419> hammer<00:05:20.419> on<00:05:20.780> that

00:05:21.070 --> 00:05:21.080 
we're going to a chord hammer on that

00:05:21.080 --> 00:05:25.900 
we're going to a chord hammer on that
extension<00:05:24.100> what<00:05:25.100> we're<00:05:25.250> doing<00:05:25.520> there<00:05:25.700> we're

00:05:25.900 --> 00:05:25.910 
extension what we're doing there we're

00:05:25.910 --> 00:05:28.240 
extension what we're doing there we're
adding<00:05:26.330> a<00:05:26.570> second<00:05:27.560> string<00:05:27.860> and<00:05:28.010> third

00:05:28.240 --> 00:05:28.250 
adding a second string and third

00:05:28.250 --> 00:05:31.270 
adding a second string and third
position<00:05:29.470> fourth<00:05:30.470> string<00:05:30.830> and<00:05:31.040> fourth

00:05:31.270 --> 00:05:31.280 
position fourth string and fourth

00:05:31.280 --> 00:05:35.950 
position fourth string and fourth
position<00:05:33.729> sort<00:05:34.729> of<00:05:34.820> like<00:05:34.940> a<00:05:34.970> d<00:05:35.300> with<00:05:35.479> an<00:05:35.570> a<00:05:35.690> base

00:05:35.950 --> 00:05:35.960 
position sort of like a d with an a base

00:05:35.960 --> 00:05:37.840 
position sort of like a d with an a base
now<00:05:36.229> we<00:05:36.290> take<00:05:36.500> that<00:05:36.710> shape<00:05:36.979> and<00:05:37.190> slide<00:05:37.520> it<00:05:37.550> up

00:05:37.840 --> 00:05:37.850 
now we take that shape and slide it up

00:05:37.850 --> 00:05:48.600 
now we take that shape and slide it up
to<00:05:38.000> fourth<00:05:38.270> position

00:05:48.600 --> 00:05:48.610 

00:05:48.610 --> 00:05:56.290 

so<00:05:49.610> the<00:05:50.060> parts<00:05:50.360> like<00:05:50.570> this<00:05:54.850> then<00:05:55.850> when<00:05:56.030> we<00:05:56.150> get

00:05:56.290 --> 00:05:56.300 
so the parts like this then when we get

00:05:56.300 --> 00:05:57.760 
so the parts like this then when we get
up<00:05:56.420> here<00:05:56.450> in<00:05:56.660> fourth<00:05:57.020> position<00:05:57.200> we're<00:05:57.740> going

00:05:57.760 --> 00:05:57.770 
up here in fourth position we're going

00:05:57.770 --> 00:06:04.420 
up here in fourth position we're going
to<00:05:57.950> suspend<00:05:58.490> this<00:05:58.670> year<00:06:02.410> with<00:06:03.410> going<00:06:04.220> to<00:06:04.280> use

00:06:04.420 --> 00:06:04.430 
to suspend this year with going to use

00:06:04.430 --> 00:06:21.060 
to suspend this year with going to use
the<00:06:04.640> pinky<00:06:05.030> on<00:06:05.360> the<00:06:05.570> third<00:06:05.840> string<00:06:08.770> right<00:06:09.770> here

00:06:21.060 --> 00:06:21.070 

00:06:21.070 --> 00:06:24.220 

now<00:06:22.070> sometimes<00:06:22.400> to<00:06:23.060> resolve<00:06:23.420> the<00:06:23.660> party<00:06:24.020> comes

00:06:24.220 --> 00:06:24.230 
now sometimes to resolve the party comes

00:06:24.230 --> 00:06:28.630 
now sometimes to resolve the party comes
back<00:06:24.580> to<00:06:25.580> that<00:06:25.610> low<00:06:25.970> any<00:06:26.320> other<00:06:27.320> times<00:06:27.710> he

00:06:28.630 --> 00:06:28.640 
back to that low any other times he

00:06:28.640 --> 00:06:32.350 
back to that low any other times he
comes<00:06:28.910> and<00:06:29.150> does<00:06:29.330> a<00:06:29.600> triad<00:06:30.260> here<00:06:31.210> which<00:06:32.210> again

00:06:32.350 --> 00:06:32.360 
comes and does a triad here which again

00:06:32.360 --> 00:06:37.060 
comes and does a triad here which again
is<00:06:32.750> rooted<00:06:33.620> in<00:06:33.710> that<00:06:34.000> shape<00:06:35.000> are<00:06:35.300> so<00:06:36.050> like<00:06:36.350> so

00:06:37.060 --> 00:06:37.070 
is rooted in that shape are so like so

00:06:37.070 --> 00:06:39.010 
is rooted in that shape are so like so
again<00:06:37.370> the<00:06:37.700> fundamental<00:06:38.090> that<00:06:38.660> you<00:06:38.780> really

00:06:39.010 --> 00:06:39.020 
again the fundamental that you really

00:06:39.020 --> 00:06:41.140 
again the fundamental that you really
want<00:06:39.200> to<00:06:39.260> work<00:06:39.410> on<00:06:39.710> getting<00:06:40.130> a<00:06:40.310> firm<00:06:40.610> grasp<00:06:40.640> of

00:06:41.140 --> 00:06:41.150 
want to work on getting a firm grasp of

00:06:41.150 --> 00:06:44.770 
want to work on getting a firm grasp of
your<00:06:41.330> triads<00:06:41.900> and<00:06:43.030> by<00:06:44.030> doing<00:06:44.240> that<00:06:44.390> going<00:06:44.720> to

00:06:44.770 --> 00:06:44.780 
your triads and by doing that going to

00:06:44.780 --> 00:06:48.430 
your triads and by doing that going to
take<00:06:44.810> your<00:06:45.020> bar<00:06:45.230> chords<00:06:45.700> and<00:06:47.350> you're<00:06:48.350> not

00:06:48.430 --> 00:06:48.440 
take your bar chords and you're not

00:06:48.440 --> 00:06:49.960 
take your bar chords and you're not
going<00:06:48.560> to<00:06:48.620> always<00:06:48.800> play<00:06:48.980> the<00:06:49.190> full<00:06:49.430> court<00:06:49.790> you

want to be able to play
the<00:06:52.690> first<00:06:52.960> three<00:06:53.290> notes<00:06:53.440> which<00:06:53.740> is<00:06:53.890> here<00:06:54.930> or
