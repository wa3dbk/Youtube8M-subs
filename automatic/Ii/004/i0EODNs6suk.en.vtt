of third-party programs to take control
of<00:00:52.640> home<00:00:53.640> automation<00:00:54.090> and<00:00:54.360> so<00:00:54.539> on<00:00:54.690> and<00:00:55.850> also

00:00:56.840 --> 00:00:56.850 
of home automation and so on and also

00:00:56.850 --> 00:00:59.689 
of home automation and so on and also
recently<00:00:57.840> we've<00:00:58.079> added<00:00:58.289> support<00:00:58.680> for<00:00:58.949> a

00:00:59.689 --> 00:00:59.699 
recently we've added support for a

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:03.319 
recently we've added support for a
device<00:01:00.270> called<00:01:00.570> Rundberg<00:01:01.609> which<00:01:02.609> is<00:01:02.820> here<00:01:03.059> the

00:01:03.319 --> 00:01:03.329 
device called Rundberg which is here the

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:05.179 
device called Rundberg which is here the
silver<00:01:03.750> shield<00:01:03.960> power<00:01:04.379> manager<00:01:04.830> you<00:01:05.070> have

00:01:05.179 --> 00:01:05.189 
silver shield power manager you have

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:08.149 
silver shield power manager you have
four<00:01:05.700> ports<00:01:06.210> which<00:01:06.960> you<00:01:07.140> can<00:01:07.320> control

00:01:08.149 --> 00:01:08.159 
four ports which you can control

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:11.000 
four ports which you can control
individually<00:01:08.939> so<00:01:09.390> you<00:01:09.450> can<00:01:09.600> have<00:01:09.750> a<00:01:10.010> computer

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:11.010 
individually so you can have a computer

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:15.530 
individually so you can have a computer
here<00:01:11.460> you<00:01:12.090> know<00:01:12.840> lamp<00:01:13.799> etc<00:01:14.640> etc<00:01:14.700> and<00:01:15.240> you<00:01:15.390> can

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:15.540 
here you know lamp etc etc and you can

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:18.620 
here you know lamp etc etc and you can
control<00:01:15.840> all<00:01:16.439> them<00:01:16.710> by<00:01:16.890> SMS<00:01:17.460> or<00:01:17.820> web<00:01:17.970> or<00:01:18.240> API

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:18.630 
control all them by SMS or web or API

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:22.100 
control all them by SMS or web or API
and<00:01:18.900> so<00:01:19.110> on<00:01:19.259> and<00:01:20.070> here<00:01:20.820> is<00:01:20.909> a<00:01:20.939> single<00:01:21.270> port

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:22.110 
and so on and here is a single port

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:25.850 
and so on and here is a single port
version<00:01:22.950> let's<00:01:23.759> plugged<00:01:24.030> in<00:01:24.590> now<00:01:25.590> I'll

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:25.860 
version let's plugged in now I'll

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:29.090 
version let's plugged in now I'll
demonstrate<00:01:26.369> by<00:01:26.909> sending<00:01:27.299> an<00:01:27.390> SMS<00:01:27.890> I'll<00:01:28.890> say

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:29.100 
demonstrate by sending an SMS I'll say

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:32.330 
demonstrate by sending an SMS I'll say
gem<00:01:29.490> on<00:01:30.350> that's<00:01:31.350> the<00:01:31.470> nickname<00:01:31.650> I<00:01:32.009> have<00:01:32.189> on

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:32.340 
gem on that's the nickname I have on

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:34.910 
gem on that's the nickname I have on
this<00:01:32.460> and<00:01:33.049> basically<00:01:34.049> the<00:01:34.259> message<00:01:34.619> is<00:01:34.770> sent

00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:34.920 
this and basically the message is sent

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:37.219 
this and basically the message is sent
to<00:01:35.040> the<00:01:35.189> mobile<00:01:35.340> network<00:01:35.960> received<00:01:36.960> by<00:01:37.170> the

00:01:37.219 --> 00:01:37.229 
to the mobile network received by the

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:39.289 
to the mobile network received by the
USB<00:01:37.560> modem<00:01:38.009> it's<00:01:38.250> got<00:01:38.430> a<00:01:38.460> SIM<00:01:38.670> card<00:01:38.700> and<00:01:39.240> a

00:01:39.289 --> 00:01:39.299 
USB modem it's got a SIM card and a

00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:40.190 
USB modem it's got a SIM card and a
phone<00:01:39.509> number<00:01:39.540> on<00:01:39.840> it

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:40.200 
phone number on it

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:42.679 
phone number on it
and<00:01:40.350> then<00:01:40.829> sends<00:01:41.159> out<00:01:41.310> a<00:01:41.340> pulse<00:01:41.570> to<00:01:42.570> this

00:01:42.679 --> 00:01:42.689 
and then sends out a pulse to this

00:01:42.689 --> 00:01:45.080 
and then sends out a pulse to this
device<00:01:43.079> which<00:01:43.829> will<00:01:44.009> then<00:01:44.130> turn<00:01:44.430> on<00:01:44.700> the<00:01:44.880> lamp

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:45.090 
device which will then turn on the lamp

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:48.260 
device which will then turn on the lamp
there<00:01:45.720> you<00:01:45.810> know<00:01:46.100> so<00:01:47.100> that's<00:01:47.460> the<00:01:47.759> way<00:01:47.880> home

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:48.270 
there you know so that's the way home

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:49.789 
there you know so that's the way home
automation<00:01:48.720> works<00:01:49.079> we've<00:01:49.350> also<00:01:49.530> added

00:01:49.789 --> 00:01:49.799 
automation works we've also added

00:01:49.799 --> 00:01:52.580 
automation works we've also added
support<00:01:50.250> for<00:01:50.340> sunrise<00:01:50.880> and<00:01:51.299> sunset<00:01:51.869> so

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:52.590 
support for sunrise and sunset so

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:54.889 
support for sunrise and sunset so
basically<00:01:52.860> can<00:01:53.100> inform<00:01:53.759> your<00:01:53.939> router<00:01:54.180> its

00:01:54.889 --> 00:01:54.899 
basically can inform your router its

00:01:54.899 --> 00:01:56.690 
basically can inform your router its
geographic<00:01:55.590> position<00:01:55.740> by<00:01:56.189> typing

00:01:56.690 --> 00:01:56.700 
geographic position by typing

00:01:56.700 --> 00:01:59.359 
geographic position by typing
the<00:01:56.789> coordinates<00:01:57.240> or<00:01:57.780> by<00:01:58.110> using<00:01:58.320> a<00:01:58.500> gps<00:01:58.890> dongle

00:01:59.359 --> 00:01:59.369 
the coordinates or by using a gps dongle

00:01:59.369 --> 00:02:02.569 
the coordinates or by using a gps dongle
and<00:01:59.780> based<00:02:00.780> on<00:02:00.960> that<00:02:01.020> it<00:02:01.320> will<00:02:01.409> calculate<00:02:01.649> what

00:02:02.569 --> 00:02:02.579 
and based on that it will calculate what

00:02:02.579 --> 00:02:05.029 
and based on that it will calculate what
time<00:02:02.820> the<00:02:03.000> Sun<00:02:03.240> will<00:02:03.390> rise<00:02:03.600> and<00:02:03.960> stuff<00:02:04.229> and<00:02:04.439> set

00:02:05.029 --> 00:02:05.039 
time the Sun will rise and stuff and set
