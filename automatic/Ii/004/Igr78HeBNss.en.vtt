00:00:04.740 --> 00:00:07.050 

the<00:00:05.740> chord<00:00:06.010> we're<00:00:06.100> going<00:00:06.220> to<00:00:06.310> start<00:00:06.609> with<00:00:06.700> is

00:00:07.050 --> 00:00:07.060 
the chord we're going to start with is

00:00:07.060 --> 00:00:09.450 
the chord we're going to start with is
an<00:00:07.540> E<00:00:07.750> chord<00:00:07.779> and<00:00:08.230> it's<00:00:08.350> the<00:00:08.470> eform<00:00:09.010> now<00:00:09.309> if<00:00:09.400> you

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:09.460 
an E chord and it's the eform now if you

00:00:09.460 --> 00:00:10.890 
an E chord and it's the eform now if you
familiar<00:00:09.790> with<00:00:09.880> the<00:00:09.910> cage<00:00:10.150> system<00:00:10.510> you<00:00:10.809> know

00:00:10.890 --> 00:00:10.900 
familiar with the cage system you know

00:00:10.900 --> 00:00:12.720 
familiar with the cage system you know
there<00:00:11.020> are<00:00:11.139> five<00:00:11.410> block<00:00:11.770> forms<00:00:12.190> based<00:00:12.400> off<00:00:12.700> of

00:00:12.720 --> 00:00:12.730 
there are five block forms based off of

00:00:12.730 --> 00:00:14.939 
there are five block forms based off of
the<00:00:12.969> open<00:00:13.360> position<00:00:13.450> chords<00:00:14.080> so<00:00:14.740> let's<00:00:14.889> just

00:00:14.939 --> 00:00:14.949 
the open position chords so let's just

00:00:14.949 --> 00:00:17.730 
the open position chords so let's just
take<00:00:15.190> the<00:00:15.309> typical<00:00:15.639> ecord<00:00:16.059> that<00:00:16.180> you<00:00:16.240> know<00:00:16.740> you

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:17.740 
take the typical ecord that you know you

00:00:17.740 --> 00:00:19.980 
take the typical ecord that you know you
learned<00:00:17.920> it<00:00:18.039> early<00:00:18.130> on<00:00:18.539> and<00:00:19.539> when<00:00:19.720> you<00:00:19.810> play

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:19.990 
learned it early on and when you play

00:00:19.990 --> 00:00:22.109 
learned it early on and when you play
this<00:00:20.170> chord<00:00:20.500> you<00:00:21.220> know<00:00:21.369> that<00:00:21.550> it's<00:00:21.670> rude<00:00:21.849> third

00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:22.119 
this chord you know that it's rude third

00:00:22.119 --> 00:00:23.759 
this chord you know that it's rude third
and<00:00:22.269> fifth<00:00:22.480> if<00:00:22.689> you<00:00:22.720> don't<00:00:23.050> you<00:00:23.380> can<00:00:23.529> look<00:00:23.679> at

00:00:23.759 --> 00:00:23.769 
and fifth if you don't you can look at

00:00:23.769 --> 00:00:25.980 
and fifth if you don't you can look at
the<00:00:23.859> diagram<00:00:24.070> that's<00:00:24.609> labeled<00:00:24.759> e<00:00:25.150> and<00:00:25.390> this

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:25.990 
the diagram that's labeled e and this

00:00:25.990 --> 00:00:28.189 
the diagram that's labeled e and this
voicing<00:00:26.500> would<00:00:26.650> always<00:00:27.189> be<00:00:27.429> from<00:00:27.640> low<00:00:27.789> to<00:00:27.820> high

00:00:28.189 --> 00:00:28.199 
voicing would always be from low to high

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:33.630 
voicing would always be from low to high
15<00:00:30.210> 1351<00:00:31.650> so<00:00:32.650> in<00:00:32.740> essence<00:00:33.010> you<00:00:33.070> get<00:00:33.220> a<00:00:33.250> big<00:00:33.460> e

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:33.640 
15 1351 so in essence you get a big e

00:00:33.640 --> 00:00:36.680 
15 1351 so in essence you get a big e
power<00:00:34.060> cord<00:00:34.450> you<00:00:34.630> get<00:00:34.780> that<00:00:34.960> one<00:00:35.230> major<00:00:36.190> third

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:36.690

fourth<00:00:42.550> fingers<00:00:43.059> and<00:00:43.300> even<00:00:43.480> try<00:00:43.690> it<00:00:43.719> with<00:00:43.899> some

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:43.930 
fourth fingers and even try it with some

00:00:43.930 --> 00:00:45.569 
fourth fingers and even try it with some
other<00:00:44.170> fingerings<00:00:44.590> for<00:00:44.710> using<00:00:44.980> double<00:00:45.309> stones

just<00:00:45.789> for<00:00:45.969> fun<00:00:46.180> you<00:00:46.210> won't<00:00:46.390> always<00:00:46.539> stretch

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:46.930 
just for fun you won't always stretch

00:00:46.930 --> 00:00:49.369 
just for fun you won't always stretch
yourself<00:00:47.140> but<00:00:48.039> if<00:00:48.160> you<00:00:48.250> encounter<00:00:48.579> this<00:00:48.879> chord

00:00:49.369 --> 00:00:49.379 
yourself but if you encounter this chord

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:51.299 
yourself but if you encounter this chord
now<00:00:50.379> I'm<00:00:50.590> only<00:00:50.769> going<00:00:50.920> to<00:00:50.980> scratch<00:00:51.190> the

00:00:51.299 --> 00:00:51.309 
now I'm only going to scratch the

00:00:51.309 --> 00:00:52.709 
now I'm only going to scratch the
surface<00:00:51.460> on<00:00:51.730> scales<00:00:52.030> but<00:00:52.180> if<00:00:52.300> you<00:00:52.390> encounter

00:00:52.709 --> 00:00:52.719 
surface on scales but if you encounter

00:00:52.719 --> 00:00:54.900 
surface on scales but if you encounter
this<00:00:53.019> chord<00:00:53.379> we're<00:00:54.100> going<00:00:54.219> to<00:00:54.280> use<00:00:54.519> a<00:00:54.550> system

00:00:54.900 --> 00:00:54.910 
this chord we're going to use a system

00:00:54.910 --> 00:00:57.029 
this chord we're going to use a system
where<00:00:55.210> we<00:00:55.239> just<00:00:55.420> line<00:00:55.660> the<00:00:55.809> numbers<00:00:56.170> up<00:00:56.350> if<00:00:56.590> you

00:00:57.029 --> 00:00:57.039 
where we just line the numbers up if you

00:00:57.039 --> 00:00:59.549 
where we just line the numbers up if you
look<00:00:57.190> at<00:00:57.309> the<00:00:57.429> cord<00:00:57.820> you<00:00:58.780> analyze<00:00:59.140> and<00:00:59.320> you<00:00:59.379> say

00:00:59.549 --> 00:00:59.559 
look at the cord you analyze and you say

00:00:59.559 --> 00:01:00.959 
look at the cord you analyze and you say
what<00:00:59.920> are<00:01:00.039> the<00:01:00.100> different<00:01:00.429> numbers<00:01:00.730> that<00:01:00.879> we

00:01:00.959 --> 00:01:00.969 
what are the different numbers that we

00:01:00.969 --> 00:01:03.000 
what are the different numbers that we
have<00:01:01.179> in<00:01:01.329> the<00:01:01.390> cord<00:01:01.690> the<00:01:01.989> cord<00:01:02.019> is<00:01:02.350> one<00:01:02.589> three

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:03.010 
have in the cord the cord is one three

00:01:03.010 --> 00:01:04.770 
have in the cord the cord is one three
and<00:01:03.039> five<00:01:03.210> now<00:01:04.210> we'll<00:01:04.330> be<00:01:04.449> dealing<00:01:04.600> with

00:01:04.770 --> 00:01:04.780 
and five now we'll be dealing with

00:01:04.780 --> 00:01:06.630 
and five now we'll be dealing with
heptite<00:01:05.199> onyx<00:01:05.530> scales<00:01:05.770> your<00:01:05.980> basic<00:01:06.340> major

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:06.640 
heptite onyx scales your basic major

00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:08.730 
heptite onyx scales your basic major
scale<00:01:07.060> and<00:01:07.360> all<00:01:07.900> the<00:01:08.020> modes<00:01:08.170> generated<00:01:08.680> from

00:01:08.730 --> 00:01:08.740 
scale and all the modes generated from

00:01:08.740 --> 00:01:10.950 
scale and all the modes generated from
the<00:01:08.860> major<00:01:08.980> scale<00:01:09.160> and<00:01:09.570> some<00:01:10.570> of<00:01:10.690> the<00:01:10.750> modes

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:10.960 
the major scale and some of the modes

00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:12.480 
the major scale and some of the modes
generated<00:01:11.410> from<00:01:11.470> the<00:01:11.620> melodic<00:01:11.980> minor<00:01:12.190> and

00:01:12.480 --> 00:01:12.490 
generated from the melodic minor and

00:01:12.490 --> 00:01:15.120 
generated from the melodic minor and
perhaps<00:01:12.880> one<00:01:13.300> from<00:01:13.600> the<00:01:13.840> harmonic<00:01:14.500> minor<00:01:14.650> so

00:01:15.120 --> 00:01:15.130 
perhaps one from the harmonic minor so

00:01:15.130 --> 00:01:17.010 
perhaps one from the harmonic minor so
they<00:01:15.280> are<00:01:15.370> all<00:01:15.550> seven<00:01:16.030> note<00:01:16.180> scale<00:01:16.210> so<00:01:16.810> if<00:01:16.900> we

00:01:17.010 --> 00:01:17.020 
they are all seven note scale so if we

00:01:17.020 --> 00:01:19.830 
they are all seven note scale so if we
have<00:01:17.170> a<00:01:17.200> cord<00:01:17.560> it<00:01:17.710> has<00:01:17.970> three<00:01:18.970> components<00:01:19.120> root

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:19.840 
have a cord it has three components root

00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:21.600 
have a cord it has three components root
third<00:01:20.080> and<00:01:20.260> fifth<00:01:20.560> all<00:01:21.190> you<00:01:21.280> can<00:01:21.370> do<00:01:21.490> is<00:01:21.580> a

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:21.610 
third and fifth all you can do is a

00:01:21.610 --> 00:01:23.490 
third and fifth all you can do is a
little<00:01:21.790> subtraction<00:01:22.300> seven<00:01:23.110> notes<00:01:23.290> in<00:01:23.410> the

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:23.500 
little subtraction seven notes in the

00:01:23.500 --> 00:01:25.920 
little subtraction seven notes in the
scale<00:01:23.740> seven<00:01:24.160> possible<00:01:24.550> notes<00:01:24.760> you<00:01:25.720> have

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:25.930 
scale seven possible notes you have

00:01:25.930 --> 00:01:28.410 
scale seven possible notes you have
three<00:01:26.410> notes<00:01:26.620> into<00:01:26.860> chords<00:01:27.250> so<00:01:27.490> 7<00:01:27.790> minus<00:01:27.880> 3<00:01:28.270> is

00:01:28.410 --> 00:01:28.420 
three notes into chords so 7 minus 3 is

00:01:28.420 --> 00:01:30.780 
three notes into chords so 7 minus 3 is
4<00:01:28.810> so<00:01:29.020> there<00:01:29.170> are<00:01:29.260> four<00:01:29.500> variables<00:01:30.130> now<00:01:30.640> if<00:01:30.700> you

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:30.790 
4 so there are four variables now if you

00:01:30.790 --> 00:01:32.580 
4 so there are four variables now if you
want<00:01:30.940> to<00:01:31.030> get<00:01:31.120> really<00:01:31.390> analytical<00:01:32.050> and<00:01:32.170> go

00:01:32.580 --> 00:01:32.590 
want to get really analytical and go

00:01:32.590 --> 00:01:34.470 
want to get really analytical and go
crazy<00:01:32.890> on<00:01:33.010> this<00:01:33.280> sit<00:01:33.700> down<00:01:33.850> write<00:01:34.090> down<00:01:34.240> all

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:34.480 
crazy on this sit down write down all

00:01:34.480 --> 00:01:36.570 
crazy on this sit down write down all
the<00:01:34.540> possibilities<00:01:35.200> of<00:01:35.440> the<00:01:35.920> remaining<00:01:36.250> four

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:36.580 
the possibilities of the remaining four

00:01:36.580 --> 00:01:38.760 
the possibilities of the remaining four
tones<00:01:36.880> we're<00:01:37.540> just<00:01:37.630> going<00:01:37.810> to<00:01:37.840> go<00:01:38.050> very<00:01:38.230> basic

00:01:38.760 --> 00:01:38.770 
tones we're just going to go very basic

00:01:38.770 --> 00:01:42.060 
tones we're just going to go very basic
here<00:01:39.010> if<00:01:39.250> you<00:01:39.550> encounter<00:01:39.850> this<00:01:40.090> e<00:01:40.270> chord<00:01:41.070> there

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:42.070 
here if you encounter this e chord there

are a few modes that would be very

knee<00:02:21.080> would<00:02:21.260> be<00:02:21.470> a<00:02:21.500> viable<00:02:21.950> scale<00:02:22.580> over<00:02:23.030> this

knee would be a viable scale over this
cool<00:02:23.920> then<00:02:24.920> you<00:02:25.069> would<00:02:25.160> have<00:02:25.190> the<00:02:25.519> Lydian<00:02:25.850> mode

00:02:26.050 --> 00:02:26.060 
cool then you would have the Lydian mode

00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:29.650 
cool then you would have the Lydian mode
which<00:02:26.330> changes<00:02:27.790> and<00:02:28.790> puts<00:02:29.000> a<00:02:29.060> sharp<00:02:29.360> four

00:02:29.650 --> 00:02:29.660

instead of a natural form and that would

00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:38.350 
instead of a natural form and that would
be<00:02:35.510> the<00:02:35.600> next<00:02:36.019> scale<00:02:36.260> you<00:02:36.500> could<00:02:36.650> use<00:02:37.060> the<00:02:38.060> next

00:02:38.350 --> 00:02:38.360

you're<00:02:44.060> putting<00:02:44.299> in<00:02:44.390> a<00:02:44.480> flat<00:02:44.720> seven<00:02:45.230> the<00:02:45.830> thing

00:02:46.090 --> 00:02:46.100 
you're putting in a flat seven the thing

00:02:46.100 --> 00:02:48.729 
you're putting in a flat seven the thing
is<00:02:46.130> that<00:02:46.340> the<00:02:46.880> core<00:02:47.209> doesn't<00:02:47.599> really<00:02:48.080> outline

00:02:48.729 --> 00:02:48.739 
is that the core doesn't really outline

00:02:48.739 --> 00:02:51.610 
is that the core doesn't really outline
or<00:02:48.980> feed<00:02:49.370> that<00:02:49.700> flat<00:02:50.000> seven<00:02:50.450> so<00:02:51.230> you<00:02:51.290> have<00:02:51.500> to

00:02:51.610 --> 00:02:51.620 
or feed that flat seven so you have to

00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:53.140 
or feed that flat seven so you have to
be<00:02:51.799> the<00:02:52.040> judge<00:02:52.069> of<00:02:52.310> how<00:02:52.580> far<00:02:52.880> you<00:02:52.970> want<00:02:53.060> to

00:02:53.140 --> 00:02:53.150 
be the judge of how far you want to

00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:55.210 
be the judge of how far you want to
extend<00:02:53.510> your<00:02:53.750> scale<00:02:54.049> by<00:02:54.380> putting<00:02:54.739> other<00:02:54.890> tones

00:02:55.210 --> 00:02:55.220 
extend your scale by putting other tones

extend your scale by putting other tones
in<00:02:55.900> ESET<00:02:56.900> would<00:02:57.079> obviously<00:02:57.530> establish<00:02:58.280> a<00:02:58.459> mix

00:02:58.630 --> 00:02:58.640 
in ESET would obviously establish a mix

you<00:03:00.440> wouldn't<00:03:00.650> use<00:03:00.769> Ionian<00:03:01.220> religion<00:03:01.609> because

00:03:01.870 --> 00:03:01.880 
you wouldn't use Ionian religion because

00:03:01.880 --> 00:03:04.090 
you wouldn't use Ionian religion because
they<00:03:02.030> both<00:03:02.180> have<00:03:02.359> a<00:03:02.390> natural<00:03:02.780> seven<00:03:03.079> but<00:03:03.950> will

00:03:04.090 --> 00:03:04.100 
they both have a natural seven but will

00:03:04.100 --> 00:03:10.480 
they both have a natural seven but will
include<00:03:04.400> mixolydian

that would be a scale would fit over

that would be a scale would fit over
this<00:03:12.840> so<00:03:13.530> now<00:03:13.620> I'm<00:03:13.860> going<00:03:13.980> to<00:03:14.100> play<00:03:14.250> a<00:03:14.280> little

this so now I'm going to play a little

00:03:14.430 --> 00:03:16.400 
this so now I'm going to play a little
jam<00:03:14.760> track<00:03:15.000> where<00:03:15.150> I<00:03:15.180> just<00:03:15.209> strum<00:03:15.690> this<00:03:16.140> e

00:03:20.840 --> 00:03:20.850 
I'm going to be hitting the base

00:03:20.850 --> 00:03:23.060 
I'm going to be hitting the base
remember<00:03:21.300> we<00:03:21.390> have<00:03:21.630> the<00:03:22.170> baseline<00:03:22.650> as<00:03:22.860> the

00:03:23.060 --> 00:03:23.070 
remember we have the baseline as the

00:03:23.070 --> 00:03:25.160 
remember we have the baseline as the
lowest<00:03:23.310> tone<00:03:23.730> the<00:03:24.120> root<00:03:24.390> of<00:03:24.480> the<00:03:24.600> chord<00:03:24.810> is<00:03:25.020> the
