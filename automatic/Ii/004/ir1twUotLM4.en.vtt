 Connect the microphone headset to the distance headmaster the USB two new here in front 

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:52.970
 then we have a lot of status leds here in the previous Monday coach 

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:53.920
 the front 

00:00:53.920 --> 00:00:56.470

 around the back of a man in large pack a 6-cell battery 40 

00:01:10.870 --> 00:01:14.930
 Grad hours should be good for about 7 to 8 hours of operation 

00:01:14.930 --> 00:01:18.380
 I like that or not where I can get my hard drive fast 

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:21.829
 the lock was one I can change so I can get the wi-fi carbon frame 

00:01:21.829 --> 00:01:22.940
 the exchange 

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:26.190

 Unscrew in front of the chest 

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:32.650
 around the surface, they reach out to the stick per pop culture 

00:01:32.650 --> 00:01:35.580
 Picture quite funny you're supposed to define exactly 

00:01:35.580 --> 00:01:39.540
 But why in any case information whether Roman Pop fingerprints 

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:41.870
 can see is probably so bad 

00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:46.730
 as in this picture, not just 7 percent Toshiba Portégé 210 livestream 

00:01:47.900 --> 00:01:52.930

00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:04.570
 Karaman small microphone webcam from Schwalmtal is here the park or 

00:02:04.570 --> 00:02:05.950
 to have blown up 

00:02:05.950 --> 00:02:07.880
 GC is clearly more choice 

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:10.989
 otherwise no chiclet keyboard 

00:02:10.989 --> 00:02:13.989
 we knew 

00:02:14.489 --> 00:02:16.999
 big enough keys 

00:02:16.999 --> 00:02:21.549
 and so a bit on the firs on the cliffs the Committee are so graded 

00:02:21.549 --> 00:02:22.999
 in the morning

 Jansen is something in shape 

00:02:31.049 --> 00:02:34.729
 only Toshiba offers relatively small rights shift button otherwise 

00:02:35.759 --> 00:02:39.419
 as a consolation is going on pieces for the feedback 

00:02:39.419 --> 00:02:40.899
 really really good 

00:02:40.899 --> 00:02:44.359
 Schappert I like extremely well there are even Innsbruck shift 

00:02:44.359 --> 00:02:48.260
 we are essentially surface the proceeds should be the golden middle ground 

00:02:48.989 --> 00:02:51.919
 and 2 big ones of the rights 

00:02:51.919 --> 00:02:54.669
 and left from Essen 

00:02:54.669 --> 00:02:58.430
 that that all will be killed by the way 

00:02:58.430 --> 00:03:00.920
 for Switzerland that not only pleases the surface of the 

00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:03.499
 Palm rest should come 

00:03:03.499 --> 00:03:07.159

00:03:17.789 --> 00:03:22.599
 a simply higher resolution at otherwise a nice chosen percent 

00:03:23.189 --> 00:03:30.200
 Good design Good workmanship to make it relatively easy for slider NB 250 

00:03:30.199 --> 00:03:31.439
