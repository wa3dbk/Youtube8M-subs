00:03:37.509 --> 00:03:37.519 
issue with audio quality on it

00:03:37.519 --> 00:03:39.699 
issue with audio quality on it
whatsoever<00:03:37.760> you<00:03:38.569> know<00:03:38.660> that's<00:03:38.959> why<00:03:39.109> a<00:03:39.380> lot<00:03:39.500> of

00:03:39.699 --> 00:03:39.709 
whatsoever you know that's why a lot of

00:03:39.709 --> 00:03:40.930 
whatsoever you know that's why a lot of
times<00:03:39.950> I<00:03:40.069> choose<00:03:40.280> this<00:03:40.310> over<00:03:40.549> a<00:03:40.700> camcorder

00:03:40.930 --> 00:03:40.940 
times I choose this over a camcorder

00:03:40.940 --> 00:03:42.849 
times I choose this over a camcorder
because<00:03:41.690> the<00:03:41.840> audio<00:03:42.139> quality<00:03:42.200> is<00:03:42.590> very<00:03:42.650> good

00:03:42.849 --> 00:03:42.859 
because the audio quality is very good

00:03:42.859 --> 00:03:44.800 
because the audio quality is very good
but<00:03:43.160> it's<00:03:43.340> not<00:03:43.400> intimidating<00:03:43.760> and<00:03:44.569> you<00:03:44.660> walk

00:03:44.800 --> 00:03:44.810 
but it's not intimidating and you walk

00:03:44.810 --> 00:03:46.420 
but it's not intimidating and you walk
