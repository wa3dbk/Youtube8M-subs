00:00:04.160 --> 00:00:14.370
 basis for the dropper and serves in general 

00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:16.430
 this one is a custom dropper from 0 

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:21.300
 up to 40 liters 

00:00:16.430 --> 00:00:24.060
 often half a jitter i'm a bit of it 

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:28.980
 file because used hose 

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:32.000
 a narrower one costs twenty-eight hryvnia 

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:35.000
 10 pieces 

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:35.000
 Pochep 

00:00:41.140 --> 00:00:49.690
 the hose is not as simple as you can see 

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:54.760
 thinner it is inside and wide 

00:00:49.690 --> 00:00:58.690
 how would go thin how see black 

00:00:54.760 --> 00:00:58.690
 Finns one s black 

00:00:59.350 --> 00:01:12.350
 he goes up above the water level high 

00:01:05.869 --> 00:01:16.369
 viola and poured photo thick just 

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:19.030
 ends in the cover the cover just 

00:01:16.369 --> 00:01:19.030
 glue up 

00:01:22.720 --> 00:01:28.930
 put back this very 

00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:45.920
 thin need a hose so that at the moment 

00:01:41.570 --> 00:01:48.560
 when all the water came out here to form 

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:52.430
 in the air hose and need it somehow 

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:55.430
 squeeze out turns out used 

00:01:52.430 --> 00:01:57.400
 such a system with a thin return hose 

00:01:55.430 --> 00:02:03.410
 connections 

00:01:57.400 --> 00:02:11.030
 you pull out the inside of the salute out 

00:02:03.410 --> 00:02:13.190
 hair tell you about exceptional 

00:02:11.030 --> 00:02:16.660
 situations for example if you have some 

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:21.200
 the way the perry hose bends like this 

00:02:16.660 --> 00:02:27.550
 that is, you get an air lock 

00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:27.550
 i feel it has a more love her 

00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:35.750
 then this system will not work if 

00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:39.920
 100 ml per threshold will not be now 

00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:55.930
 show but the idea is try 

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:55.930
 If that now pour water 4 

00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:17.060
 generally works 

00:03:17.980 --> 00:03:23.640
 you can customize a little bit to 

00:03:20.409 --> 00:03:27.180
 slower but it doesn't matter 

00:03:23.640 --> 00:03:27.180
 such a system
