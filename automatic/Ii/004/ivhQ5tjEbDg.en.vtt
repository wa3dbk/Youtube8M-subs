00:01:06.689 --> 00:01:11.189
 These are the shots 

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:15.560
 I think you can say today that that 

00:01:11.189 --> 00:01:19.950
 a archived to rtl kinderhaus and 

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:22.530
 We are investing in this house now 

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:24.150
 to the children the socially disadvantaged 

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:27.350
 are a second home to create 

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:30.060
 there are also social educators 

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:32.659

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:34.670
 courses take place 

00:01:32.659 --> 00:01:37.500

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:41.490
 Equal opportunities for children 

00:01:39.509 --> 00:01:44.090
 not so good to make easy 

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:47.000
 so that everyone tries 

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:49.700
 really a good introduction to the 

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:52.569

00:01:49.700 --> 00:02:01.189

00:01:52.569 --> 00:02:04.179

00:02:01.189 --> 00:02:04.179
 story from his music 

00:02:04.220 --> 00:02:07.940
 in my form also an important role 

00:02:05.720 --> 00:02:13.280
 the number with the children also together 

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:15.740

 of course, the hobbies of the small and 

00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:24.050
 Some people really needed that 

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:25.820
 Get the street that you do not have the school 

00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:28.580
 tails and that is actually one 

00:02:25.820 --> 00:02:30.170
 school tuyer project so they neither 

00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:33.800
 any interests in itself 

00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:35.120
 discover and try that there 

00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:37.190
 to be fetched from the street again 

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:39.430
 and in a good way like me 

00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:39.430

00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:55.980
 We prefer to manually get the cloth 

00:02:53.310 --> 00:02:57.420

00:02:55.980 --> 00:03:04.170
