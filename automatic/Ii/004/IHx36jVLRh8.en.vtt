00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.980
 hey that happens fans welcome to the best 

00:00:02.700 --> 00:00:07.290
 training and custom tactic of 

00:00:04.980 --> 00:00:09.840
 fifa 15 but first of all I wanted you 

00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:12.450
 ask forgiveness for taking so long without 

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:14.219
 upload video but good morning has passed 

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:16.440
 his life a blog where he will explain the 

00:00:14.219 --> 00:00:18.810
 motives and with that said let's start with 

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:21.330
 the video in goal as you see we have to 

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:23.519
 tim howard we all know that this year 

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:25.769
 the porters are really bad but to me 

00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:27.390
 howard I thought the most state of 

00:00:25.769 --> 00:00:29.580
 all I've tried so what 

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:31.679
 let's put it because it is highly recommended 

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:35.160
 right side we have kyle walker 

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:37.620
 with these 91 of pace 80 of physical 76 of 

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:39.540
 defense act an attack because we want 

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:41.670
 that the sides rise a lot 

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:44.160
 we have on the left to clichy 

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:47.340
 which also has high attack and core of 

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:49.260
 85 surely many superficial ones to 

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:51.629
 Alberto Moreno for me crisis more 

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:53.579
 rendered spectacular in central 

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:55.860
 we have a conscious and we have one that 

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:58.530
 stays more in defense and another that goes up 

00:00:55.860 --> 00:01:00.390
 more since with custom tactic 

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:02.640
 what we are looking for is to have a pressure 

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:05.040
 high and steal balls in the field 

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:06.390
 otherwise why are we here say 

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:08.159
 sure that those high 

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:10.260
 in defense and high in attack they throw us 

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:12.450
 back a little but I tell you that 

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:14.540
 if you say it is very good and it will help us 

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:16.800
 very much in the ball pressure 

00:01:14.540 --> 00:01:19.110
 defensive midfielder we have a matic 

00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:23.880
 this time more defensive even than 

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:26.220
 bed bugs but as you see 194 height 85 of 

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:28.950
 physical will balance all our 

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:31.500
 team is the defensive midfielder by 

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:33.869
 middle left excellence we have andré 

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:36.000
 schürrle maybe his stats are not everything 

00:01:33.869 --> 00:01:38.580
 correct since it has not given me as 

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:40.470
 I was waiting but the custom tactic 

00:01:38.580 --> 00:01:42.570
 wants the ends to get into the 

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:45.420
 half touch with the offensive midfielder 

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:47.520
 and generate many occasions as you see 

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:49.920
 look at them on the right side has 

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:52.470
 rendered something better than schürrle despite 

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:55.440
 of having worse a priori stats 

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:59.100
 let's move on to the offensive trident as 

00:01:55.440 --> 00:02:01.200
 You see, angel would come from 180 meters tall 

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:03.000
 high attack, high defense is , 

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:06.840
 they are enough for all parts of the field 

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:09.060
 but as you see 30 games 36 goals and 

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:12.150
 two assists I'm loving this 

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:15.659
 di Maria and attack will have the duo 

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:18.329
 with vargas that measures 175 but has high 

00:02:15.659 --> 00:02:20.099
 in attack 12 matches 9 goals 

00:02:18.329 --> 00:02:22.379
 I was not rotating with jovetic but 

00:02:20.099 --> 00:02:24.360
 finally I stay with vargas so 

00:02:22.379 --> 00:02:26.549
 on the left hand finally 

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:28.230
 we have aguero which is high in 

00:02:26.549 --> 00:02:32.040
 attack and under defense 

00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:35.099
 88 and 86 rhythm of shooting 16 matches 25 

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:38.220
 goals 6 assists highly recommended is 

00:02:35.099 --> 00:02:40.799
 good but as you know it's worth 275 thousand 

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:42.629
 coins if we reach 200 likes 

00:02:40.799 --> 00:02:45.599
 had the cheap option of this team and 

00:02:42.629 --> 00:02:47.970
 the personalized tactic is this before 

00:02:45.599 --> 00:02:50.280
 to start the match we are going to line up 

00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:52.769
 instruction handles we do not give to 

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:55.409
 tactics and we have to put all this 

00:02:52.769 --> 00:02:58.170
 what you see on the screen is very simple and 

00:02:55.409 --> 00:03:00.810
 right now let's see the play 

00:02:58.170 --> 00:03:03.120
 the goal that you are going to put thousands with this 

00:03:00.810 --> 00:03:04.799
 because look we started with a robbery of 

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:06.629
 midfield ball and playing the first 

00:03:04.799 --> 00:03:08.129
 touch making walls look how 

00:03:06.629 --> 00:03:10.290
 I would call you get in and thanks to your 

00:03:08.129 --> 00:03:13.079
 speed goes from goalkeeper and goal 

00:03:10.290 --> 00:03:15.329
 pleasures are nine minutes so this one 

00:03:13.079 --> 00:03:16.889
 is going to be the typical play of our 

00:03:15.329 --> 00:03:18.960
 team we can also do trinkets 

00:03:16.889 --> 00:03:20.340
 as with omen as you see there 

00:03:18.960 --> 00:03:22.920
 but I'm going to leave you with a 

00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:25.590
 music and with some goals and yes yes 

00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:27.750
 we reached 200 likes because I'll leave you the 

00:03:25.590 --> 00:03:29.640
 cheap option in another video so 

00:03:27.750 --> 00:03:32.600
 I hope you liked it and see you 

00:03:29.640 --> 00:03:32.600
 in the but yes no 

00:03:44.720 --> 00:03:52.310
 they are all the same
