00:00:12.920 --> 00:00:18.260
 nice all guys i'm brands 

00:00:15.530 --> 00:00:20.990
 welcome to my first video for 

00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:22.880
 the bus network community 

00:00:20.990 --> 00:00:25.910
 then let me introduce myself as I said 

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:28.099
 mark am says that in inverted commas 1 

00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:32.570
 youtuber because in quotation marks because me 

00:00:28.099 --> 00:00:34.879
 actually I go back to the year of 2010 

00:00:32.570 --> 00:00:37.129
 then we come back to this comment 

00:00:34.879 --> 00:00:40.010
 that we find ourselves as you see yourself up 

00:00:37.129 --> 00:00:41.000
 matter I would like to talk about 

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:44.300
 fashion of youtube 

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:46.970
 then obviously starting from when 

00:00:44.300 --> 00:00:47.780
 i was born on youtube let's say fifth to 

00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:51.769
 2010 

00:00:47.780 --> 00:00:54.650
 then I had a channel there 

00:00:51.769 --> 00:00:58.909
 called few with master each 504 

00:00:54.650 --> 00:01:04.790
 which was my first channel and it is 

00:00:58.909 --> 00:01:09.799
 lasted from 2010 to the summer of 2011 

00:01:04.790 --> 00:01:13.810
 so once then from 2010 the fashion 

00:01:09.799 --> 00:01:15.830
 it was let's say on nintendo fashion 

00:01:13.810 --> 00:01:18.680
 mainly made pokémon because 

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:20.780
 because we say that it generates a little I say 

00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:23.960
 idées in pokémon like today that there is 

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:26.539
 I have thousands of guides and we say that 

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:29.390
 the few that were there were had 

00:01:26.539 --> 00:01:31.009
 lots of views though me 

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:33.229
 I remember at the beginning that I was making videos 

00:01:31.009 --> 00:01:35.000
 very ugly because obviously I had to 

00:01:33.229 --> 00:01:36.469
 still understand the mentality as you 

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:38.420
 they did so 

00:01:36.469 --> 00:01:41.990
 however it was possible to arrive after a 

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:45.200
 day at 3000 4000 views that 

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:47.270
 obviously they weren't cheap now 

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:49.460
 I can not even get to 50 

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:55.340
 display then thinking a little about 

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:57.049
 2010 has changed a lot since 

00:01:55.340 --> 00:02:00.380
 pokémon fashion lasted up to 

00:01:57.049 --> 00:02:02.810
 when the summer of 2011 why why 

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:04.850
 the summer of 2011 managed a beta that 

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:07.009
 now all 

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:09.770
 they know that by now some on the broken 

00:02:07.009 --> 00:02:12.380
 already a bit to treat it that minecraft 

00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:13.819
 then I minecraft at that time did not 

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:16.340
 I knew 

00:02:13.819 --> 00:02:19.870
 and in fact I didn't even know what I play 

00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:23.950
 it was minecraft I discovered it in January 

00:02:19.870 --> 00:02:26.569
 both January just the discovered e 

00:02:23.950 --> 00:02:28.580
 at the beginning we all say they were 

00:02:26.569 --> 00:02:30.530
 skeptical about this game because we say 

00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:33.770
 that by now we are used to playing hd 

00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:35.450
 in high definition without pixels and so on 

00:02:33.770 --> 00:02:37.610
 while at this game that was all 

00:02:35.450 --> 00:02:38.380
 contrary to what we see in the 

00:02:37.610 --> 00:02:41.269
 videogame 

00:02:38.380 --> 00:02:43.180
 this game is all cube zoe everything 

00:02:41.269 --> 00:02:45.380
 we say it was badly done let's say 

00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:48.830
 instead this game managed to 

00:02:45.380 --> 00:02:50.720
 break through on youtube in fact 

00:02:48.830 --> 00:02:52.850
 some youtubers have to say thanks to 

00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:57.650
 this game if I am of course now 

00:02:52.850 --> 00:02:58.630
 famous on the tube and both are 

00:02:57.650 --> 00:03:03.739
 famous on youtube 

00:02:58.630 --> 00:03:07.250
 then after a while it came out 

00:03:03.739 --> 00:03:09.620
 another fashion that went together with 

00:03:07.250 --> 00:03:12.860
 minecraft that the fashion to comment 

00:03:09.620 --> 00:03:15.070
 obviously in 2010 they were not like 

00:03:12.860 --> 00:03:18.350
 they are 

00:03:15.070 --> 00:03:21.920
 acquisition card like vermilion 

00:03:18.350 --> 00:03:23.870
 the pvr a roxy or other cards 

00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:27.799
 acquisition were not card 

00:03:23.870 --> 00:03:30.200
 acquisition so no one knew 

00:03:27.799 --> 00:03:32.660
 again what was the commentaries while 

00:03:30.200 --> 00:03:37.130
 had to have it let's say a pretty pc 

00:03:32.660 --> 00:03:40.820
 powerful to be able to deal but but 

00:03:37.130 --> 00:03:44.359
 in 2012, in fact, the new ri fashion was born 

00:03:40.820 --> 00:03:47.420
 commentaries thanks to the outputs of s p di 

00:03:44.359 --> 00:03:50.180
 avermedia ppr acquisition cards 

00:03:47.420 --> 00:03:52.400
 etcetera etc. that even sexy women run 

00:03:50.180 --> 00:03:57.049
 let's say quite a bit like the expensive ptr 

00:03:52.400 --> 00:03:59.329
 150 while we can take the truth 

00:03:57.049 --> 00:04:01.819
 media that I think is more comfortable than 

00:03:59.329 --> 00:04:05.180
 it costs 600 euros 110 euros I don't have 

00:04:01.819 --> 00:04:07.489
 need the computer and sincerely a 

00:04:05.180 --> 00:04:11.930
 my opinion is more convenient in fact soon 

00:04:07.489 --> 00:04:13.970
 I should buy it and say that 

00:04:11.930 --> 00:04:16.280
 now minecraft is taking off a little 

00:04:13.970 --> 00:04:18.680
 the part we say because why now 

00:04:16.280 --> 00:04:22.070
 minecraft treat it a bit all e 

00:04:18.680 --> 00:04:24.740
 I was saying that these youtubers who deal with 

00:04:22.070 --> 00:04:27.530
 minecraft have not fail anymore a 

00:04:24.740 --> 00:04:29.540
