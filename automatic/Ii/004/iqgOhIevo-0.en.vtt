00:02:32.960 --> 00:02:32.970 
the 18th minute and buries it so we're

00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:35.420 
the 18th minute and buries it so we're
to<00:02:33.120> kneel<00:02:33.300> down<00:02:33.510> after<00:02:34.410> 20<00:02:34.739> minutes<00:02:34.950> less<00:02:35.220> than

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:35.430 
to kneel down after 20 minutes less than

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:37.490 
to kneel down after 20 minutes less than
20<00:02:35.760> minutes<00:02:35.970> so<00:02:36.300> I<00:02:36.330> was<00:02:36.599> pretty<00:02:36.840> annoyed<00:02:37.230> at

00:02:37.490 --> 00:02:37.500 
20 minutes so I was pretty annoyed at

on a really nice run here though it has
this<00:02:46.410> shot<00:02:46.620> eventually<00:02:47.099> but<00:02:47.190> it's<00:02:47.310> a<00:02:47.340> good

00:02:47.479 --> 00:02:47.489 
this shot eventually but it's a good

00:02:49.980 --> 00:02:51.440 
save by proto and it does eventually get
it<00:02:50.099> clear<00:02:50.370> and<00:02:50.519> then<00:02:50.610> as<00:02:50.730> we<00:02:50.880> headed<00:02:51.060> towards

00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:51.450 
it clear and then as we headed towards

00:02:51.450 --> 00:02:53.449 
it clear and then as we headed towards
halftime<00:02:51.840> as<00:02:52.019> you<00:02:52.110> can<00:02:52.260> see<00:02:52.410> we<00:02:52.860> were<00:02:52.980> in<00:02:53.190> first

00:02:53.449 --> 00:02:53.459 
halftime as you can see we were in first

00:02:53.459 --> 00:02:55.910 
halftime as you can see we were in first
half<00:02:53.670> stoppage<00:02:53.730> time<00:02:54.150> now<00:02:54.540> we<00:02:54.959> got<00:02:55.110> loads<00:02:55.680> of

00:02:55.910 --> 00:02:55.920 
half stoppage time now we got loads of

00:02:55.920 --> 00:02:57.650 
half stoppage time now we got loads of
lag<00:02:56.160> that<00:02:56.400> came<00:02:56.549> out<00:02:56.670> absolutely<00:02:56.880> nowhere

00:02:57.650 --> 00:02:57.660 
lag that came out absolutely nowhere

00:02:57.660 --> 00:02:59.509 
lag that came out absolutely nowhere
we'd<00:02:57.870> had<00:02:58.019> no<00:02:58.230> lag<00:02:58.440> whatsoever<00:02:58.650> for<00:02:59.220> the

00:02:59.509 --> 00:02:59.519 
we'd had no lag whatsoever for the

00:02:59.519 --> 00:03:01.220 
we'd had no lag whatsoever for the
entirety<00:02:59.880> of<00:03:00.090> the<00:03:00.239> game<00:03:00.360> up<00:03:00.540> until<00:03:00.660> stoppage

00:03:01.220 --> 00:03:01.230 
entirety of the game up until stoppage

00:03:01.230 --> 00:03:02.990 
entirety of the game up until stoppage
time<00:03:01.260> at<00:03:01.500> the<00:03:01.560> end<00:03:01.680> of<00:03:01.739> the<00:03:01.829> first<00:03:02.010> half<00:03:02.190> and<00:03:02.640> it

00:03:02.990 --> 00:03:03.000 
time at the end of the first half and it

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:05.990 
time at the end of the first half and it
was<00:03:03.150> completely<00:03:03.959> out<00:03:04.170> of<00:03:04.500> nowhere<00:03:04.769> so<00:03:05.400> we<00:03:05.819> made

00:03:05.990 --> 00:03:06.000 
was completely out of nowhere so we made

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:08.150 
was completely out of nowhere so we made
the<00:03:06.030> sporting<00:03:06.660> decision<00:03:07.170> that's<00:03:07.620> obviously

00:03:08.150 --> 00:03:08.160 
the sporting decision that's obviously

00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:10.220 
the sporting decision that's obviously
because<00:03:08.400> we're<00:03:08.549> at<00:03:08.670> halftime<00:03:08.910> and<00:03:09.450> it<00:03:09.840> was<00:03:10.019> two

00:03:10.220 --> 00:03:10.230 
because we're at halftime and it was two

00:03:10.230 --> 00:03:12.410 
because we're at halftime and it was two
nil<00:03:10.440> and<00:03:10.680> obviously<00:03:11.340> it<00:03:11.790> didn't<00:03:12.120> seem<00:03:12.269> like<00:03:12.299> he

00:03:12.410 --> 00:03:12.420 
nil and obviously it didn't seem like he

00:03:12.420 --> 00:03:13.940 
nil and obviously it didn't seem like he
was<00:03:12.540> going<00:03:12.840> to<00:03:12.870> improve<00:03:13.170> connection-wise<00:03:13.650> we

00:03:13.940 --> 00:03:13.950 
was going to improve connection-wise we

00:03:13.950 --> 00:03:16.250 
was going to improve connection-wise we
started<00:03:14.459> again<00:03:14.819> oh<00:03:15.030> you<00:03:15.569> know<00:03:15.690> we<00:03:15.810> waited<00:03:16.079> five

00:03:17.539 --> 00:03:17.549 
minutes started again and we're going to

00:03:17.549 --> 00:03:19.580 
minutes started again and we're going to
play<00:03:17.730> just<00:03:18.150> that<00:03:18.299> opening<00:03:18.720> 45<00:03:19.170> minutes<00:03:19.470> of

00:03:19.580 --> 00:03:19.590

00:03:22.250 --> 00:03:22.260 
the scores at the end because it

00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:23.809 
the scores at the end because it
wouldn't<00:03:22.440> be<00:03:22.500> fair<00:03:22.650> to<00:03:22.709> either<00:03:22.980> of<00:03:23.160> us<00:03:23.280> to<00:03:23.579> play

00:03:23.809 --> 00:03:23.819 
wouldn't be fair to either of us to play

wouldn't be fair to either of us to play
on<00:03:24.060> that<00:03:24.569> connection<00:03:25.350> that<00:03:25.470> really<00:03:25.889> even<00:03:26.160> what

00:03:26.330 --> 00:03:26.340 
on that connection that really even what

00:03:26.340 --> 00:03:29.059 
on that connection that really even what
decreased<00:03:27.239> after<00:03:27.690> that<00:03:27.870> it<00:03:28.319> just<00:03:28.380> kept

00:03:29.059 --> 00:03:29.069 
decreased after that it just kept

00:03:29.069 --> 00:03:30.259 
decreased after that it just kept
freezing<00:03:29.310> you<00:03:29.579> know<00:03:29.639> you<00:03:29.790> get<00:03:29.910> the<00:03:30.000> spinny

00:03:30.259 --> 00:03:30.269 
freezing you know you get the spinny

00:03:30.269 --> 00:03:31.849 
freezing you know you get the spinny
circle<00:03:30.660> in<00:03:30.720> the<00:03:30.780> bottom<00:03:31.049> corner<00:03:31.200> but<00:03:31.530> we

00:03:31.849 --> 00:03:31.859 
circle in the bottom corner but we

00:03:31.859 --> 00:03:33.229

picked up a corner here in the 20th
minute<00:03:33.269> of<00:03:33.569> the<00:03:33.750> second<00:03:34.200> half<00:03:34.350> so<00:03:34.620> to<00:03:34.650> speak

00:03:34.940 --> 00:03:34.950 
minute of the second half so to speak

00:03:34.950 --> 00:03:36.890
