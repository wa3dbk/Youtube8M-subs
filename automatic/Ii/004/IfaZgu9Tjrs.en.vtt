00:00:07.370 --> 00:00:12.389
 the epson e htw 6600 is going to be one of 

00:00:10.769 --> 00:00:14.250
 references to remember for amateurs 

00:00:12.389 --> 00:00:21.420
 home cinema looking for a product 

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:22.650
 rather accessible epson offers us a 

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:24.869
 product that is really very very good 

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:26.970
 made with very good image quality 

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:28.500
 it is not super bright on it 

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:30.000
 still sees behind me even though the 

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:31.410
 room is sure enlighten us we 

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.300
 will still recommend doing a 

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:34.739
 room are to enjoy the quality 

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:36.870
 of this projector to note anyway 

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:39.750
 that the contrast ratio is out of the ordinary 

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:41.219
 6700 for a it's just awesome on a 

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:42.570
 home theater system 

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:43.980
 the other strong point you will enjoy 

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:46.860
 necessarily and well it is its connectivity 

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:49.050
 which is ultra complete and epson brought 

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:50.760
 a special care to integration you 

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:52.289
 will be able to make this product since they 

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:54.180
 book even a cash that will allow you in 

00:00:52.289 --> 00:00:55.949
 camouflage the connectors so 

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:57.270
 to better integrate the video projector 

00:00:55.949 --> 00:00:58.980
 in your living room but as it is not 

00:00:57.270 --> 00:01:02.100
 always obvious to have the sources to 

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:04.619
 near the projector the tbw 6600 

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:06.810
 in its version w comes with a 

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:09.180
 wireless hd box that allows you so 

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:11.640
 to broadcast up to four sources without 

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:13.710
 wire then from your blu-ray turntables to the 

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:15.540
 video projector ergonomics always the 

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:17.009
 quality of this retro remote control 

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:18.840
 enlightened that will allow you in addition to 

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:20.610
 pilot all the functions really 

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:22.770
 very rich of this video projector 

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:24.810
 last strong point these speakers to 

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:26.159
 the back certainly the purists will say that 

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:27.659
 it sounds pretty much like pans 

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:29.850
 but for a system that we could 

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:31.470
 finally transported from home to home 

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:32.700
 friends why not to watch a 

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:33.869
 football match and well finally the 

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:36.470
 two small speakers in the background 

00:01:33.869 --> 00:01:36.470
 already well the job 

00:01:38.409 --> 00:01:42.829
 here our thermal camera confirms it 

00:01:41.360 --> 00:01:45.649
 this video projector actually heats 

00:01:42.829 --> 00:01:46.369
 a lot 70 Â° directly out of 

00:01:45.649 --> 00:01:48.020
 his fan 

00:01:46.369 --> 00:01:49.340
 if the product is hanging from the ceiling 

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:50.869
 no problem on the other hand if you 

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:53.770
 put next to you he might do 

00:01:50.869 --> 00:01:53.770
 hot very fast 

00:01:55.630 --> 00:01:59.750
 still a good product for the 

00:01:57.500 --> 00:02:00.110
 constructor however quite expensive 1800 

00:01:59.750 --> 00:02:02.030
 euros 

00:02:00.110 --> 00:02:03.679
 it will be necessary above all to privilege the good 

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:06.280
 promos on the net can not be found elsewhere. 

00:02:03.679 --> 00:02:06.280
 1500 euros
