00:00:01.010 --> 00:00:05.490
 well, the whole match is over 

00:00:03.330 --> 00:00:08.730
 of today's gaming day we are failing 

00:00:05.490 --> 00:00:10.530
 results of the second day of the the group stage 

00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:12.900
 international and sits next to it 

00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:16.619
 comrade who won his last 

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:20.400
 Romanovic game 

00:00:16.619 --> 00:00:25.170
 Ilya body novels novel stunningly well 

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:28.260
 Th tell as well and there is hot 

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:30.390
 for the first time in long hockey 

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:32.489
 the amount of time we decided to pack up 

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:35.100
 Before the game they calmly discuss everything 

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:36.780
 we will take what we will do and in general 

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:40.020
 then we all got nerves 

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:42.660
 retreated before and so understood this from the mage in 

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:45.690
 the first place Andrei miracle came in and 

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:47.789
 brewed real sold and then a lot 

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:49.890
 it did not work for him and indeed we are you 

00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:52.800
 so watched your games your really 

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:55.739
 almost every game has any chance of soy 

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:58.500
 then somewhere some failure here failure 

00:00:55.739 --> 00:01:00.840
 did not happen it was output English 

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:03.210
 order to start on just 

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:08.250
 stopped what to do and so we 

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:10.950
 brought out very well there 1000 so 5 7 already 

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:13.799
 came up then went up to 3 but then 

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:15.630
 you won back some of those topics but 

00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:16.920
 the most important thing is the moral moral after 

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:20.909
 today's game day 

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:23.430
 rose a little bit at least yes of course 

00:01:20.909 --> 00:01:25.920
 no longer like after all these games 

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:27.630
 today's no so scary always 

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:29.909
 nice first favorites beat 

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:33.090
 secondly , it will end the day 

00:01:29.909 --> 00:01:33.990
 on a positive yes but probably it was probably 

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:36.119
 would be better 

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:38.100
 that it was of course the first match on 

00:01:36.119 --> 00:01:40.799
 today so with this positive charge 

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:43.140
 play further how do you think the novel but 

00:01:40.799 --> 00:01:45.420
 I think it didnâ€™t give us a push for 

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:46.649
 next matches so we are more confident 

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:49.380
 somehow felt 

00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:52.520
 until tomorrow there will be 1 volumes that won 

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:55.020
 import so Andrei just in case 

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:57.060
 positive on the body positively come in 

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:58.890
 come yes there is a big difference on 

00:01:57.060 --> 00:02:00.869
 actually between just won or 

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:03.720
 won the tournament favorites and with 

00:02:00.869 --> 00:02:05.520
 in such a language I like defeat and 

00:02:03.720 --> 00:02:06.929
 the match turned out that they had nothing at all 

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:09.600
 just can't make everyone died 

00:02:06.929 --> 00:02:12.360
 what opinion could andrew andrew 

00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:14.730
 went and chopped he clicked cherish and depressions 

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:16.650
 look rum we have such a cool 

00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:19.049
 the topic is called very highlights 

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:21.239
 we look file it and here is a rubricator 

00:02:19.049 --> 00:02:22.830
 Yes, and actually we now look for 

00:02:21.239 --> 00:02:24.799
 highlight us your game and you tell 

00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:27.709
 how really highlight and 

00:02:24.799 --> 00:02:31.170
 failure dota because always 

00:02:27.709 --> 00:02:31.890
 Orthodox I know all Smokey look 

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:33.299
 which you clicked 

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:36.239
 one is actually usually very 

00:02:33.299 --> 00:02:39.600
 shows him at least one this is not 

00:02:36.239 --> 00:02:44.850
 important around the world 300 is also high life itself 

00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:45.269
 on itself to fly a flypaper to files on pad 

00:02:44.850 --> 00:02:47.609
 me 

00:02:45.269 --> 00:02:50.670
 but bb always shows us what 

00:02:47.609 --> 00:02:53.579
 light tube comes well and by the way 

00:02:50.670 --> 00:02:56.700
 Already 1 brand is demolished a highlight not here 

00:02:53.579 --> 00:03:00.380
 product and to highlight 2 this product as you 

00:02:56.700 --> 00:03:01.620
 treat to 1 led to the 

00:03:00.380 --> 00:03:05.489
 door 

00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:07.140
 dota likes it very much 

00:03:05.489 --> 00:03:13.620
 show how defenseless then killed 

00:03:07.140 --> 00:03:16.120
 Finnish heroes yes so but further on this 

00:03:13.620 --> 00:03:25.799
 I understand there will be some game 

00:03:16.120 --> 00:03:25.799
 yes very similar to the highlight but also 

00:03:26.580 --> 00:03:34.870
 there were people got mad 

00:03:31.120 --> 00:03:38.230
 as usually found wateriness probably after 

00:03:34.870 --> 00:03:41.640
 from this moment you have already lit eyes 

00:03:38.230 --> 00:03:44.549
 there was such a rage sports and 

00:03:41.640 --> 00:03:48.760
 went 3 said varnavska tell here 

00:03:44.549 --> 00:03:49.450
 such anger affected Bosko huge 

00:03:48.760 --> 00:03:53.260
 the Dragon 

00:03:49.450 --> 00:03:54.819
 this commandment but after the so 

00:03:53.260 --> 00:03:57.549
 already somehow confidently and started yourself 

00:03:54.819 --> 00:03:59.260
 feel and know that if everything is 

00:03:57.549 --> 00:04:02.379
 continue on the same course 

00:03:59.260 --> 00:04:04.480
 enough for us why flaybot why 

00:04:02.379 --> 00:04:07.870
 I did not understand this either 

00:04:04.480 --> 00:04:12.610
 and he actually even explain psycho 

00:04:07.870 --> 00:04:18.120
 Well, that the magician is no longer soared 904 y 

00:04:12.610 --> 00:04:20.769
 her account and went out watching games yes it 

00:04:18.120 --> 00:04:25.270
 the only game where they could not 

00:04:20.769 --> 00:04:28.060
 keep track of everything is usually all of course here 

00:04:25.270 --> 00:04:30.370
 the odds turned aside immediately after the time of 

00:04:28.060 --> 00:04:32.770
 minds have already begun at enemy base 

00:04:30.370 --> 00:04:36.669
 run amok I think at this moment already 

00:04:32.770 --> 00:04:43.690
 understand what's what a little bit 

00:04:36.669 --> 00:04:45.430
 the background to take and here is the magician 

00:04:43.690 --> 00:04:47.650
 moment from mac tears off roshana to them like 

00:04:45.430 --> 00:04:50.590
 someone drove one question and to the ground 

00:04:47.650 --> 00:04:52.720
 clicking well you leave. died there by 

00:04:50.590 --> 00:04:54.850
 the road well, and then the fly is certainly a good plaza 

00:04:52.720 --> 00:04:59.169
 the shaft of the pump already in the course was important foot 

00:04:54.850 --> 00:05:02.740
 control cycle phases such moments are usually 

00:04:59.169 --> 00:05:03.910
 it's over what you can already can 

00:05:02.740 --> 00:05:08.550
 all in the area where 

00:05:03.910 --> 00:05:16.570
 and where is the main point you decided 

00:05:08.550 --> 00:05:18.420
 the failed throne there really is that 

00:05:16.570 --> 00:05:20.670
 you can ask the novel 

00:05:18.420 --> 00:05:22.910
 I do not know how to go on some of 

00:05:20.670 --> 00:05:25.830
 century exercise was most what you 

00:05:22.910 --> 00:05:28.830
 that's who you really thought for sure 

00:05:25.830 --> 00:05:30.780
 that's the first game day but when 

00:05:28.830 --> 00:05:33.150
 rivals came across not very strong 

00:05:30.780 --> 00:05:34.740
 everything and we played really bad and here 

00:05:33.150 --> 00:05:39.480
 this is not very heavy rain it is not 

00:05:34.740 --> 00:05:41.940
 he is there we could all win games we 

00:05:39.480 --> 00:05:44.100
 just one currency itself was visible not 

00:05:41.940 --> 00:05:46.560
 don't get very upset and really 

00:05:44.100 --> 00:05:50.610
 tomorrow you will have a couple of holes already 

00:05:46.560 --> 00:05:52.590
 and here is their same for tomorrow and rock 

00:05:50.610 --> 00:05:54.990
 where you will still be short, they have a 

00:05:52.590 --> 00:05:56.040
 nothing was coming here and the stock is 

00:05:54.990 --> 00:05:57.990
 what are your games 

00:05:56.040 --> 00:06:00.600
 anyway don't underestimate it 

00:05:57.990 --> 00:06:02.760
 yes of course hitting the price for the game by the way 

00:06:00.600 --> 00:06:04.470
 won let's actually see 

00:06:02.760 --> 00:06:06.420
 total standings by results 

00:06:04.470 --> 00:06:11.100
 of today the mouse is there and the novel 

00:06:06.420 --> 00:06:16.970
 some information for a novel novel 

00:06:11.100 --> 00:06:20.370
 Inga novel bye 

00:06:16.970 --> 00:06:26.310
 apologist gave it interrogate small 

00:06:20.370 --> 00:06:28.080
 in bills so well vici gaming 

00:06:26.310 --> 00:06:29.850
 the first line takes them 

00:06:28.080 --> 00:06:32.580
 only one defeat who you 

00:06:29.850 --> 00:06:34.770
 waited by would think yes by the way 

00:06:32.580 --> 00:06:38.670
 but few could offer on the second 

00:06:34.770 --> 00:06:42.480
 63 teams occupy the spot 63 

00:06:38.670 --> 00:06:45.240
 sometimes picked up the same cad under gathered 

00:06:42.480 --> 00:06:47.160
 also got together with us who else 

00:06:45.240 --> 00:06:49.610
 alliance more or less gathered not three 

00:06:47.160 --> 00:06:52.380
 of the four games won here today 

00:06:49.610 --> 00:06:54.980
 could they live too spoil but in 

00:06:52.380 --> 00:06:58.950
 eventually spoiled life a little bit they 

00:06:54.980 --> 00:07:01.890
 Well, this is our standings 

00:06:58.950 --> 00:07:04.820
 trying such a domination american 

00:07:01.890 --> 00:07:07.560
 Chinese top 5 for the moment 

00:07:04.820 --> 00:07:10.640
 representative of america china and only 

00:07:07.560 --> 00:07:14.100
 we then dilute it all because 

00:07:10.640 --> 00:07:17.430
 further again asia again america again 

00:07:14.100 --> 00:07:20.100
 China and then all of Europe to Europe there 

00:07:17.430 --> 00:07:21.750
 No avatar for like to point out yet 

00:07:20.100 --> 00:07:23.550
 Newbies who were considered favorites of the tournament 

00:07:21.750 --> 00:07:27.570
 but now they are 

00:07:23.550 --> 00:07:29.850
 shoot let's say well, and why next 

00:07:27.570 --> 00:07:32.520
 I win the lines they have one win 

00:07:29.850 --> 00:07:34.770
 rather than 2 correctly they are kind of a slak view 

00:07:32.520 --> 00:07:37.980
 still banguli apparently not until the end 

00:07:34.770 --> 00:07:39.900
 watched the game and happened should be 

00:07:37.980 --> 00:07:41.490
 one more and one more wins maybe this 

00:07:39.900 --> 00:07:44.820
 We have not refreshed just our signs 

00:07:41.490 --> 00:07:47.160
 but apparently oh well I'm on 

00:07:44.820 --> 00:07:48.960
 actually think we can novel 

00:07:47.160 --> 00:07:50.820
 let go put smiles here and 

00:07:48.960 --> 00:07:54.690
 take stock of the day because the Roma do not 

00:07:50.820 --> 00:07:56.820
 all games watched watched conquered 

00:07:54.690 --> 00:08:03.030
 baby shed a word romance on viewers 

00:07:56.820 --> 00:08:05.070
 I donâ€™t hope the fans support there 

00:08:03.030 --> 00:08:08.130
 we will get together and win the following games and 

00:08:05.070 --> 00:08:11.250
 we also hope good luck to everyone 

00:08:08.130 --> 00:08:13.460
 hello interrupt the gathering of all 

00:08:11.250 --> 00:08:19.550
 hello hello everyone 

00:08:13.460 --> 00:08:19.550
 neatly put on
