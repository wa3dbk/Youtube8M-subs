00:00:25.109 --> 00:00:29.359
 yes, certainly with my diploma 

00:00:38.890 --> 00:00:45.770
 I have specifically for this course 

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:48.560
 chosen because of the people on it 

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:52.280
 whose opinion to which opinion I whole 

00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:54.080
 much give recommended is i have specific 

00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:56.720
 chosen for the european institute 

00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:58.490
 because it is a broad education that 

00:00:56.720 --> 00:00:59.990
 I think it is very important that I was so fed up 

00:00:58.490 --> 00:01:01.760
 my work some people who have one 

00:00:59.990 --> 00:01:03.560
 Coaching had always done me 

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:07.000
 from one angle 

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:07.000
 muzzle innopay or from 

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:12.260
 solution-oriented work and I wanted to 

00:01:10.610 --> 00:01:16.100
 actually i like everything so i do 

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:17.570
 actually wanted to learn everything and and 

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:18.320
 can use all of that and can 

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:20.390
 Bet 

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:23.900
 one of the important issues that it involves 

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:26.119
 the european institute is that you are in 

00:01:23.900 --> 00:01:28.580
 a few years it grows to 

00:01:26.119 --> 00:01:30.229
 to the times in the coach section and also the 

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:32.930
 techniques you own and then 

00:01:30.229 --> 00:01:34.550
 practice a lot and that is one 

00:01:32.930 --> 00:01:36.940
 substantial difference between European 

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:40.400
 institute and other training institutes 

00:01:36.940 --> 00:01:43.580
 two things for me it is wide 

00:01:40.400 --> 00:01:46.070
 it gives me a very broad palette 

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:48.110
 I come into contact with yes and can 

00:01:46.070 --> 00:01:52.130
 choosing what suits me is not everything 

00:01:48.110 --> 00:01:53.660
 was with me and two because it's on you 

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:56.240
 really you need to get started so 

00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:58.369
 it's not a trick what you learn 

00:01:56.240 --> 00:02:01.880
 but it is really about yourself 

00:01:58.369 --> 00:02:02.420
 and go from that mindset 

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:06.350
 coaching 

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:08.390
 yes that is still over for broken 

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:10.789
 another important reason was that I myself 

00:02:08.390 --> 00:02:12.860
 had the feeling that when you start coaching 

00:02:10.789 --> 00:02:15.260
 because then you are it yourself 

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:17.390
 most important tool and that was 

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:18.920
 also on the site that they are there too and that is 

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:20.870
 also proved so good in the first year that 

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:22.340
 they do a lot of work on that 

00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:23.590
 that really needs to develop 

00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:26.530
 I chose this course 

00:02:23.590 --> 00:02:29.740
 due to wide range of the 

00:02:26.530 --> 00:02:33.370
 flowing out there in therapy you that 

00:02:29.740 --> 00:02:35.440
 that and is explained in the 

00:02:33.370 --> 00:02:37.450
 during lecture and in addition that we 

00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:40.060
 are training courses that are also looked into 

00:02:37.450 --> 00:02:42.130
 how you function and how you function 

00:02:40.060 --> 00:02:43.510
 the right person in the 

00:02:42.130 --> 00:02:45.130
 relief relationship 

00:02:43.510 --> 00:02:47.500
 I also have a very long time a 

00:02:45.130 --> 00:02:50.340
 thought but have had it in the hood 

00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:50.340
 made a good choice 

00:02:55.700 --> 00:03:00.510
 what education has brought me is 

00:02:58.620 --> 00:03:03.180
 especially he wants 

00:03:00.510 --> 00:03:05.670
 self-understanding and taught me that 

00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:10.140
 Coaching really a profession is also the 

00:03:05.670 --> 00:03:13.980
 education has a lot of self-knowledge 

00:03:10.140 --> 00:03:16.560
 So I thought I already had a whole 

00:03:13.980 --> 00:03:19.190
 was end but I still have a lot with me 

00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:19.190
 Greeks 

00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:28.980
 africa me but training is going to do 

00:03:25.350 --> 00:03:30.990
 use him in my work as a manager 

00:03:28.980 --> 00:03:32.370
 what i am already 

00:03:30.990 --> 00:03:35.220
 and especially the skills you 

00:03:32.370 --> 00:03:37.830
 in your own development 

00:03:35.220 --> 00:03:38.940
 towards the other people with whom 

00:03:37.830 --> 00:03:41.970
 I work 

00:03:38.940 --> 00:03:43.890
 am actually already busy with the 

00:03:41.970 --> 00:03:46.920
 practice you are during the first year 

00:03:43.890 --> 00:03:49.620
 I already started on an opinion from van 

00:03:46.920 --> 00:03:51.570
 one of my teachers 

00:03:49.620 --> 00:03:53.250
 I work as a nurse specialist 

00:03:51.570 --> 00:03:56.880
 psychiatry 

00:03:53.250 --> 00:03:58.860
 and besides that i'm also so nice for it 

00:03:56.880 --> 00:04:01.560
 training of the site and the specialist 

00:03:58.860 --> 00:04:02.820
 in our hospital and 

00:04:01.560 --> 00:04:05.340
 within both functions, I'm going to 

00:04:02.820 --> 00:04:08.370
 I use it already 

00:04:05.340 --> 00:04:11.130
 partly in my work i work with 

00:04:08.370 --> 00:04:14.640
 expats together so I have a lot 

00:04:11.130 --> 00:04:18.840
 I have learned a lot from it 

00:04:14.640 --> 00:04:20.910
 a how you conduct a conversation how you yes 

00:04:18.840 --> 00:04:24.150
 How come 

00:04:20.910 --> 00:04:26.280
 how you better set that up how you simply 

00:04:24.150 --> 00:04:28.470
 world conversation really keeps him 

00:04:26.280 --> 00:04:31.070
 focusing on setting up one 

00:04:28.470 --> 00:04:31.070
 coach practice
