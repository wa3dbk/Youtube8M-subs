00:04:05.740 --> 00:04:07.740 
the future I think maybe I dad really
really<00:04:05.950> soak<00:04:06.250> the<00:04:06.400> pad<00:04:06.640> in<00:04:06.820> acetone<00:04:07.300> maybe

00:04:07.740 --> 00:04:07.750 
really soak the pad in acetone maybe

00:04:07.750 --> 00:04:17.240 
really soak the pad in acetone maybe
