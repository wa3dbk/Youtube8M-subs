in<00:00:43.379> this<00:00:43.559> image<00:00:43.800> what<00:00:44.280> we<00:00:44.370> basically<00:00:44.610> have<00:00:44.970> is

00:00:45.619 --> 00:00:45.629 
in this image what we basically have is

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:47.119 
in this image what we basically have is
we<00:00:45.989> have<00:00:46.110> a<00:00:46.140> tilt<00:00:46.470> to<00:00:46.620> the<00:00:46.710> right<00:00:46.890> on<00:00:47.010> the

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:50.150 
we have a tilt to the right on the
verticals<00:00:47.670> and<00:00:48.030> a<00:00:48.660> perspective<00:00:48.930> generally<00:00:49.920> in

00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:50.160 
verticals and a perspective generally in

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:53.900 
verticals and a perspective generally in
this<00:00:50.460> area<00:00:50.850> is<00:00:51.120> wrong<00:00:52.250> so<00:00:53.250> what<00:00:53.400> I<00:00:53.430> will<00:00:53.640> do<00:00:53.790> is

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:13.590 
going to grab this control point over

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:24.290 
going to grab this control point over
here<00:01:15.170> drag<00:01:16.170> it<00:01:18.020> slightly<00:01:19.020> to<00:01:19.619> the<00:01:20.390> left<00:01:23.300> to

notice<00:01:27.510> our<00:01:27.960> perspective<00:01:28.590> down<00:01:28.830> looks

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:29.130 
notice our perspective down looks

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:32.390 
notice our perspective down looks
correct<00:01:30.290> so<00:01:31.290> we<00:01:31.470> can<00:01:31.619> either<00:01:31.740> do<00:01:31.979> is<00:01:32.130> we<00:01:32.250> can

00:03:16.930 --> 00:03:16.940 
selection I'm going to come over the

00:03:16.940 --> 00:03:19.890 
selection I'm going to come over the
image<00:03:17.440> I'm<00:03:18.440> gonna<00:03:18.800> say<00:03:19.010> crop<00:03:19.280> to<00:03:19.520> selection

00:03:19.890 --> 00:03:19.900 
image I'm gonna say crop to selection

00:03:19.900 --> 00:03:25.060 
image I'm gonna say crop to selection
and<00:03:20.900> if<00:03:21.590> you'll<00:03:21.770> notice<00:03:22.160> our<00:03:23.020> our<00:03:24.070> perspective

00:03:25.060 --> 00:03:25.070 
and if you'll notice our our perspective

00:03:25.070 --> 00:03:29.050 
and if you'll notice our our perspective
on<00:03:25.310> this<00:03:25.940> vertical<00:03:26.180> has<00:03:26.570> been<00:03:26.720> corrected<00:03:28.060> I'm

00:03:29.050 --> 00:03:29.060 
on this vertical has been corrected I'm

00:03:29.060 --> 00:03:30.850 
on this vertical has been corrected I'm
still<00:03:29.390> not<00:03:29.540> satisfied<00:03:29.900> with<00:03:30.350> this<00:03:30.410> over<00:03:30.710> here

00:03:30.850 --> 00:03:30.860 
still not satisfied with this over here

00:03:30.860 --> 00:03:33.490 
still not satisfied with this over here
but<00:03:31.010> I<00:03:31.070> think<00:03:31.130> you<00:03:31.400> get<00:03:31.550> the<00:03:31.580> idea<00:03:31.730> so<00:03:32.390> that<00:03:33.170> is

00:03:33.490 --> 00:03:33.500 
but I think you get the idea so that is

00:03:33.500 --> 00:03:37.180 
but I think you get the idea so that is
perspective<00:03:34.160> control<00:03:34.700> and<00:03:35.240> cropping<00:03:36.190> so

00:03:37.180 --> 00:03:37.190 
perspective control and cropping so

00:03:37.190 --> 00:03:38.730 
perspective control and cropping so
there<00:03:37.610> again<00:03:37.880> we'll<00:03:38.090> do<00:03:38.210> it<00:03:38.300> one<00:03:38.450> more<00:03:38.510> time

00:03:38.730 --> 00:03:38.740 
there again we'll do it one more time

00:03:38.740 --> 00:03:42.280 
there again we'll do it one more time
I'm<00:03:39.740> going<00:03:39.890> to<00:03:39.950> close<00:03:40.190> this<00:03:40.400> image<00:03:41.080> I'm<00:03:42.080> not
