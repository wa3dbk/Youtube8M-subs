00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:44.680 
are like thirty dollars you probably can

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:46.500 
are like thirty dollars you probably can
open<00:02:45.040> that<00:02:45.070> many<00:02:45.400> chest<00:02:45.730> without<00:02:45.850> getting<00:02:46.360> him

that<00:02:47.350> you<00:02:47.470> would<00:02:47.560> spend<00:02:47.800> thirty<00:02:48.070> dollars<00:02:48.490> on

00:02:48.690 --> 00:02:48.700 
that you would spend thirty dollars on

00:02:48.700 --> 00:02:52.140 
that you would spend thirty dollars on

00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:52.150 
because if it was on average likely that

00:02:52.150 --> 00:02:53.730 
because if it was on average likely that
you'd<00:02:52.300> get<00:02:52.540> them<00:02:52.720> by<00:02:52.870> spending<00:02:53.350> that<00:02:53.560> many

you'd get them by spending that many

00:02:53.740 --> 00:02:56.370 
you'd get them by spending that many
keys<00:02:54.010> then<00:02:54.610> they<00:02:54.790> would<00:02:54.910> be<00:02:55.030> cheaper<00:02:55.390> oh<00:02:55.570> this

00:02:56.370 --> 00:02:56.380
