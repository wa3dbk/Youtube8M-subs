00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.560 

in<00:00:01.040> this<00:00:02.040> lesson<00:00:02.310> we'll<00:00:02.610> add<00:00:02.760> some<00:00:02.790> spin<00:00:03.360> to

00:00:03.560 --> 00:00:03.570 
in this lesson we'll add some spin to

00:00:03.570 --> 00:00:05.510 
in this lesson we'll add some spin to
our<00:00:03.720> soccer<00:00:04.049> ball<00:00:04.380> as<00:00:04.560> it<00:00:04.740> moves<00:00:04.950> along<00:00:05.100> its

00:00:05.510 --> 00:00:05.520 
our soccer ball as it moves along its

00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:10.339 
our soccer ball as it moves along its
path<00:00:07.490> let's<00:00:08.490> go<00:00:08.639> ahead<00:00:08.849> and<00:00:09.000> hit<00:00:09.090> play<00:00:09.300> can<00:00:10.139> see

00:00:10.339 --> 00:00:10.349 
path let's go ahead and hit play can see

00:00:10.349 --> 00:00:12.259 
path let's go ahead and hit play can see
the<00:00:10.679> heat<00:00:10.950> animation<00:00:11.700> of<00:00:11.790> the<00:00:11.910> soccer<00:00:12.120> ball

00:00:12.259 --> 00:00:12.269 
the heat animation of the soccer ball

00:00:12.269 --> 00:00:14.390 
the heat animation of the soccer ball
still<00:00:12.660> doesn't<00:00:12.960> look<00:00:13.049> quite<00:00:13.170> right<00:00:13.290> I<00:00:13.710> wonder

00:00:14.390 --> 00:00:14.400 
still doesn't look quite right I wonder

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:16.400 
still doesn't look quite right I wonder
why<00:00:14.549> that<00:00:14.580> is<00:00:14.940> maybe<00:00:14.969> because<00:00:15.599> we<00:00:15.780> need<00:00:15.960> to<00:00:16.109> add

00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:16.410 
why that is maybe because we need to add

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:18.529 
why that is maybe because we need to add
some<00:00:16.520> rotation<00:00:17.520> to<00:00:17.699> it<00:00:17.820> so<00:00:18.090> that's<00:00:18.300> what<00:00:18.449> we'll

00:00:18.529 --> 00:00:18.539 
some rotation to it so that's what we'll

00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:20.570 
some rotation to it so that's what we'll
take<00:00:18.779> care<00:00:18.960> of<00:00:19.020> in<00:00:19.230> this<00:00:19.350> lesson<00:00:19.590> well<00:00:20.430> go

00:00:20.570 --> 00:00:20.580 
take care of in this lesson well go

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:22.310 
take care of in this lesson well go
ahead<00:00:20.670> and<00:00:20.789> head<00:00:21.240> over<00:00:21.270> to<00:00:21.570> our<00:00:21.600> rotate<00:00:22.080> tool

00:00:22.310 --> 00:00:22.320 
ahead and head over to our rotate tool

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:25.250 
ahead and head over to our rotate tool
and<00:00:22.820> what<00:00:23.820> the<00:00:23.939> rotation<00:00:24.480> what<00:00:24.689> I<00:00:24.720> like<00:00:24.930> to<00:00:25.080> do

00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:25.260 
and what the rotation what I like to do

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:27.380 
and what the rotation what I like to do
is<00:00:25.500> switch<00:00:26.039> the<00:00:26.250> coordinate<00:00:26.760> system<00:00:26.789> to

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:27.390 
is switch the coordinate system to

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:29.929 
is switch the coordinate system to
gimbal<00:00:27.930> that'll<00:00:28.500> show<00:00:28.650> us<00:00:28.769> the<00:00:28.949> true<00:00:29.369> axis

00:00:29.929 --> 00:00:29.939 
gimbal that'll show us the true axis

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:32.510 
gimbal that'll show us the true axis
that<00:00:30.150> we<00:00:30.269> need<00:00:30.480> to<00:00:30.510> or<00:00:31.140> that<00:00:32.040> we're<00:00:32.189> animating

00:00:32.510 --> 00:00:32.520 
that we need to or that we're animating

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:35.360 
that we need to or that we're animating
the<00:00:32.790> object<00:00:33.180> in<00:00:33.329> so<00:00:33.570> in<00:00:33.840> our<00:00:34.140> case<00:00:34.340> we're<00:00:35.340> going

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:35.370 
the object in so in our case we're going

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:38.440 
the object in so in our case we're going
to<00:00:35.520> need<00:00:35.610> to<00:00:35.730> be<00:00:35.820> concerned<00:00:36.210> with<00:00:36.480> the<00:00:36.800> x-axis

00:00:38.440 --> 00:00:38.450 
to need to be concerned with the x-axis

00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:40.910 
to need to be concerned with the x-axis
all<00:00:39.450> right<00:00:39.570> so<00:00:39.690> with<00:00:39.809> that<00:00:39.930> said<00:00:40.230> I'm<00:00:40.710> going<00:00:40.860> to

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:40.920 
all right so with that said I'm going to

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:42.740 
all right so with that said I'm going to
go<00:00:41.010> ahead<00:00:41.100> and<00:00:41.190> turn<00:00:41.370> on<00:00:41.550> AutoKey<00:00:41.969> again<00:00:42.540> to

00:00:42.740 --> 00:00:42.750 
go ahead and turn on AutoKey again to

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:44.869 
go ahead and turn on AutoKey again to
speed<00:00:43.050> up<00:00:43.200> our<00:00:43.320> King<00:00:43.590> process<00:00:44.070> I'll<00:00:44.700> head<00:00:44.850> over

00:00:44.869 --> 00:00:44.879 
speed up our King process I'll head over

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:49.819 
speed up our King process I'll head over
to<00:00:45.239> our<00:00:45.270> last<00:00:45.539> frame<00:00:45.870> frame<00:00:46.170> 66<00:00:47.030> and<00:00:48.680> we<00:00:49.680> want

00:00:49.819 --> 00:00:49.829 
to our last frame frame 66 and we want

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:51.260 
to our last frame frame 66 and we want
to<00:00:49.890> make<00:00:50.010> sure<00:00:50.039> that<00:00:50.309> we<00:00:50.430> rotate<00:00:50.850> the<00:00:50.969> ball<00:00:51.120> in

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:51.270 
to make sure that we rotate the ball in

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:52.520 
to make sure that we rotate the ball in
the<00:00:51.390> right<00:00:51.539> direction<00:00:51.660> here<00:00:52.199> so<00:00:52.320> I'll<00:00:52.410> go

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:52.530 
the right direction here so I'll go

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:57.380 
the right direction here so I'll go
ahead<00:00:52.559> and<00:00:52.710> just<00:00:52.920> rotate<00:00:53.160> it<00:00:53.870> down<00:00:55.760> about<00:00:56.760> 800

00:00:57.380 --> 00:00:57.390 
ahead and just rotate it down about 800

00:00:57.390 --> 00:00:59.330 
ahead and just rotate it down about 800
degrees<00:00:57.719> or<00:00:57.899> so<00:00:58.020> just<00:00:58.230> for<00:00:58.739> an<00:00:59.010> initial

00:00:59.330 --> 00:00:59.340 
degrees or so just for an initial

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:05.539 
degrees or so just for an initial
rotation<00:01:02.809> okay<00:01:03.809> great<00:01:04.110> so<00:01:04.979> from<00:01:05.189> here<00:01:05.339> we'll

00:01:05.539 --> 00:01:05.549 
rotation okay great so from here we'll

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:08.300 
rotation okay great so from here we'll
start<00:01:05.880> back<00:01:06.030> up<00:01:06.060> the<00:01:06.390> animation<00:01:06.750> and<00:01:07.170> hit<00:01:08.159> play

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:08.310 
start back up the animation and hit play

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:14.120 
start back up the animation and hit play
let's<00:01:08.580> see<00:01:08.700> how<00:01:08.760> this<00:01:08.909> looks<00:01:12.890> okay<00:01:13.890> I'd<00:01:13.979> say

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:14.130 
let's see how this looks okay I'd say

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:17.539 
let's see how this looks okay I'd say
things<00:01:14.340> are<00:01:14.549> looking<00:01:15.360> pretty<00:01:15.479> good<00:01:15.750> now<00:01:16.549> you

00:01:17.539 --> 00:01:17.549 
things are looking pretty good now you

00:01:17.549 --> 00:01:19.580 
things are looking pretty good now you
can<00:01:17.700> see<00:01:17.880> that<00:01:17.909> the<00:01:18.360> rotation<00:01:18.780> doesn't<00:01:19.290> quite

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:19.590 
can see that the rotation doesn't quite

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:22.820 
can see that the rotation doesn't quite
match<00:01:19.860> with<00:01:20.659> the<00:01:21.659> constant<00:01:22.320> speed<00:01:22.590> of<00:01:22.740> our

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:22.830 
match with the constant speed of our

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:26.300 
match with the constant speed of our
position<00:01:23.460> that<00:01:23.840> we<00:01:24.840> have<00:01:25.229> our<00:01:25.560> path

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:26.310 
position that we have our path

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:29.179 
position that we have our path
constraints<00:01:26.909> percentage<00:01:27.420> set<00:01:27.659> to<00:01:28.040> so<00:01:29.040> what

00:01:29.179 --> 00:01:29.189 
constraints percentage set to so what

00:01:29.189 --> 00:01:31.280 
constraints percentage set to so what
that<00:01:29.220> means<00:01:29.549> is<00:01:29.790> that<00:01:29.880> we<00:01:30.420> need<00:01:30.540> to<00:01:30.689> go<00:01:30.840> to<00:01:30.900> our

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:31.290 
that means is that we need to go to our

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:34.550 
that means is that we need to go to our
F<00:01:31.500> curve<00:01:31.890> and<00:01:32.130> tweak<00:01:32.610> it<00:01:32.810> tweak<00:01:33.810> the<00:01:33.960> rotation

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:34.560 
F curve and tweak it tweak the rotation

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:37.490 
F curve and tweak it tweak the rotation
function<00:01:35.460> curve<00:01:35.700> so<00:01:36.509> that<00:01:36.659> it<00:01:36.810> matches<00:01:36.960> with

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:37.500 
function curve so that it matches with

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:41.450 
function curve so that it matches with
that<00:01:37.850> constant<00:01:38.850> speed<00:01:40.040> so<00:01:41.040> with<00:01:41.159> the<00:01:41.250> soccer

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:41.460 
that constant speed so with the soccer

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:43.370 
that constant speed so with the soccer
ball<00:01:41.579> selected<00:01:42.210> we<00:01:42.329> can<00:01:42.360> right-click<00:01:42.960> head

00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:43.380 
ball selected we can right-click head

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:47.030 
ball selected we can right-click head
over<00:01:43.619> back<00:01:43.799> to<00:01:43.950> the<00:01:44.070> curve<00:01:44.250> editor<00:01:44.399> and<00:01:46.040> what

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:47.040 
over back to the curve editor and what

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:50.240 
over back to the curve editor and what
we<00:01:47.130> need<00:01:47.280> to<00:01:47.369> be<00:01:48.049> focused<00:01:49.049> on<00:01:49.229> again<00:01:49.829> is<00:01:49.979> our

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:50.250 
we need to be focused on again is our

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:56.179 
we need to be focused on again is our
rotation<00:01:50.970> X<00:01:53.360> so<00:01:54.360> go<00:01:54.540> go<00:01:55.049> to<00:01:55.110> the<00:01:55.380> rotation<00:01:55.710> X

00:01:56.179 --> 00:01:56.189 
rotation X so go go to the rotation X

00:01:56.189 --> 00:01:59.510 
rotation X so go go to the rotation X
track<00:01:57.560> and<00:01:58.560> the<00:01:58.680> first<00:01:58.860> thing<00:01:59.009> we<00:01:59.130> want<00:01:59.280> to<00:01:59.399> do

00:01:59.510 --> 00:01:59.520 
track and the first thing we want to do

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:01.670 
track and the first thing we want to do
is<00:01:59.670> select<00:01:59.880> both<00:02:00.119> of<00:02:00.299> our<00:02:00.450> keys<00:02:00.689> and<00:02:00.930> set<00:02:01.409> the

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:01.680 
is select both of our keys and set the

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:06.020 
is select both of our keys and set the
interpolation<00:02:02.130> or<00:02:02.549> tangency<00:02:03.000> to<00:02:03.360> linear<00:02:05.030> okay

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:06.030 
interpolation or tangency to linear okay

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:08.359 
interpolation or tangency to linear okay
great<00:02:06.360> so<00:02:06.840> now<00:02:06.869> playing<00:02:07.799> the<00:02:07.920> animation

00:02:08.359 --> 00:02:08.369 
great so now playing the animation

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:10.729 
great so now playing the animation
you'll<00:02:08.520> see<00:02:08.700> that<00:02:08.879> it<00:02:09.119> has<00:02:09.149> that<00:02:10.140> constant

00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:10.739 
you'll see that it has that constant

00:02:10.739 --> 00:02:14.000 
you'll see that it has that constant
speed<00:02:11.039> I<00:02:12.319> think<00:02:13.319> to<00:02:13.440> make<00:02:13.590> this<00:02:13.709> more

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:14.010 
speed I think to make this more

00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:15.979 
speed I think to make this more
exciting<00:02:14.370> we<00:02:14.489> could<00:02:14.610> have<00:02:14.819> the<00:02:15.090> rotation

00:02:15.979 --> 00:02:15.989 
exciting we could have the rotation

00:02:15.989 --> 00:02:19.910 
exciting we could have the rotation
happen<00:02:16.379> faster<00:02:17.510> so<00:02:18.510> to<00:02:18.569> do<00:02:18.780> so<00:02:19.019> we<00:02:19.530> just<00:02:19.739> need

00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:19.920 
happen faster so to do so we just need

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:21.860 
happen faster so to do so we just need
to<00:02:20.040> increase<00:02:20.370> our<00:02:20.579> end<00:02:20.790> value<00:02:21.180> heading<00:02:21.720> back

00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:21.870 
to increase our end value heading back

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:23.929 
to increase our end value heading back
over<00:02:22.110> to<00:02:22.260> the<00:02:22.349> curve<00:02:22.530> editor<00:02:22.680> will<00:02:23.489> select<00:02:23.790> our

00:02:23.929 --> 00:02:23.939 
over to the curve editor will select our

00:02:23.939 --> 00:02:26.449 
over to the curve editor will select our
last<00:02:24.180> key<00:02:24.590> let's<00:02:25.590> go<00:02:25.709> ahead<00:02:25.829> and<00:02:25.920> really<00:02:26.280> bring

00:02:26.449 --> 00:02:26.459 
last key let's go ahead and really bring

00:02:26.459 --> 00:02:31.059 
last key let's go ahead and really bring
up<00:02:26.610> this<00:02:26.760> value<00:02:27.150> some<00:02:27.390> more<00:02:28.250> I'd<00:02:29.250> say<00:02:29.489> to<00:02:29.549> about

00:02:31.059 --> 00:02:31.069 
up this value some more I'd say to about

00:02:31.069 --> 00:02:34.550 
up this value some more I'd say to about
1500<00:02:32.209> can<00:02:33.209> we<00:02:33.360> can<00:02:33.510> set<00:02:33.780> that<00:02:33.959> by<00:02:34.290> selecting

00:02:34.550 --> 00:02:34.560 
1500 can we can set that by selecting

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:36.050 
1500 can we can set that by selecting
the<00:02:34.890> key<00:02:35.040> and<00:02:35.190> heading<00:02:35.400> over<00:02:35.640> to<00:02:35.790> the<00:02:35.879> key

00:02:36.050 --> 00:02:36.060 
the key and heading over to the key

00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:39.500 
the key and heading over to the key
stats<00:02:36.390> so<00:02:37.319> here<00:02:37.560> is<00:02:37.769> the<00:02:38.190> key<00:02:38.819> step<00:02:39.090> parameter

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:39.510 
stats so here is the key step parameter

00:02:39.510 --> 00:02:42.440 
stats so here is the key step parameter
for<00:02:39.750> the<00:02:39.959> keys<00:02:40.140> value<00:02:40.560> and<00:02:41.209> here's<00:02:42.209> the

00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:42.450 
for the keys value and here's the

00:02:42.450 --> 00:02:44.300 
for the keys value and here's the
parameter<00:02:42.810> for<00:02:42.989> the<00:02:43.140> frame<00:02:43.409> that<00:02:43.829> this<00:02:44.040> key<00:02:44.280> is

00:02:44.300 --> 00:02:44.310 
parameter for the frame that this key is

00:02:44.310 --> 00:02:46.550 
parameter for the frame that this key is
on<00:02:44.569> so<00:02:45.569> again<00:02:45.720> we<00:02:45.810> could<00:02:45.930> always<00:02:46.079> type<00:02:46.379> in<00:02:46.530> that

00:02:46.550 --> 00:02:46.560 
on so again we could always type in that

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:51.979 
on so again we could always type in that
value<00:02:46.980> of<00:02:47.099> 1500<00:02:50.540> alright<00:02:51.540> let's<00:02:51.720> see<00:02:51.780> how<00:02:51.840> this

00:02:51.979 --> 00:02:51.989 
value of 1500 alright let's see how this

00:02:51.989 --> 00:03:01.960 
value of 1500 alright let's see how this
looks<00:02:55.220> great<00:02:56.220> I'd<00:02:56.549> say<00:02:56.730> that's<00:02:56.849> much<00:02:57.120> better

00:03:01.960 --> 00:03:01.970 

00:03:01.970 --> 00:03:04.250 

now<00:03:02.970> one<00:03:03.150> thing<00:03:03.180> I'd<00:03:03.420> like<00:03:03.450> to<00:03:03.720> do<00:03:03.810> is<00:03:03.959> kind<00:03:04.019> of

00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:04.260 
now one thing I'd like to do is kind of

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:05.990 
now one thing I'd like to do is kind of
tweak<00:03:04.530> the<00:03:04.709> orientation<00:03:05.310> of<00:03:05.400> this<00:03:05.579> soccer

00:03:05.990 --> 00:03:06.000 
tweak the orientation of this soccer

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:07.490 
tweak the orientation of this soccer
ball<00:03:06.239> a<00:03:06.299> little<00:03:06.599> bit<00:03:06.750> further<00:03:06.959> you<00:03:07.200> can<00:03:07.349> see

00:03:07.490 --> 00:03:07.500 
ball a little bit further you can see

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:10.849 
ball a little bit further you can see
how<00:03:07.650> it's<00:03:07.859> kind<00:03:08.040> of<00:03:08.489> slanted<00:03:08.849> as<00:03:09.709> it<00:03:10.709> comes

00:03:10.849 --> 00:03:10.859 
how it's kind of slanted as it comes

00:03:10.859 --> 00:03:12.289 
how it's kind of slanted as it comes
around<00:03:11.129> that<00:03:11.190> bend<00:03:11.459> I'd<00:03:11.639> like<00:03:11.790> to<00:03:11.909> straighten

00:03:12.289 --> 00:03:12.299 
around that bend I'd like to straighten

00:03:12.299 --> 00:03:14.240 
around that bend I'd like to straighten
it<00:03:12.359> up<00:03:12.450> and<00:03:12.840> we<00:03:12.930> could<00:03:13.049> do<00:03:13.170> that<00:03:13.319> by<00:03:13.680> animating

00:03:14.240 --> 00:03:14.250 
it up and we could do that by animating

00:03:14.250 --> 00:03:18.920 
it up and we could do that by animating
in<00:03:14.519> the<00:03:14.879> z<00:03:15.359> axis<00:03:15.389> as<00:03:16.019> well<00:03:16.819> so<00:03:17.819> in<00:03:17.909> frame<00:03:18.180> 66

00:03:18.920 --> 00:03:18.930 
in the z axis as well so in frame 66

00:03:18.930 --> 00:03:20.960 
in the z axis as well so in frame 66
i'll<00:03:19.079> go<00:03:19.199> ahead<00:03:19.230> and<00:03:19.410> rotate<00:03:19.949> this<00:03:20.250> soccer

00:03:20.960 --> 00:03:20.970 
i'll go ahead and rotate this soccer

00:03:20.970 --> 00:03:23.420 
i'll go ahead and rotate this soccer
ball<00:03:21.269> and<00:03:21.329> the<00:03:21.660> z<00:03:21.840> axis<00:03:21.870> to<00:03:22.349> kind<00:03:22.530> of<00:03:22.590> fix<00:03:22.829> its

00:03:23.420 --> 00:03:23.430 
ball and the z axis to kind of fix its

00:03:23.430 --> 00:03:27.020 
ball and the z axis to kind of fix its
orientation<00:03:25.220> let's<00:03:26.220> see<00:03:26.370> how<00:03:26.430> this<00:03:26.609> looks<00:03:26.819> at

00:03:27.020 --> 00:03:27.030 
orientation let's see how this looks at

00:03:27.030 --> 00:03:34.729 
orientation let's see how this looks at
the<00:03:27.500> start<00:03:28.500> of<00:03:28.560> the<00:03:28.620> animation<00:03:29.010> too<00:03:33.530> ok<00:03:34.530> I

00:03:34.729 --> 00:03:34.739 
the start of the animation too ok I

00:03:34.739 --> 00:03:36.800 
the start of the animation too ok I
think<00:03:35.010> things<00:03:35.459> have<00:03:35.669> been<00:03:35.940> improved<00:03:36.359> I'd<00:03:36.629> like

00:03:36.800 --> 00:03:36.810 
think things have been improved I'd like

00:03:36.810 --> 00:03:40.069 
think things have been improved I'd like
to<00:03:36.959> go<00:03:37.109> ahead<00:03:37.139> and<00:03:37.440> on<00:03:38.310> frames<00:03:39.269> are<00:03:39.540> Oh<00:03:39.569> kind<00:03:39.959> of

00:03:40.069 --> 00:03:40.079 
to go ahead and on frames are Oh kind of

00:03:40.079 --> 00:03:41.990 
to go ahead and on frames are Oh kind of
adjusting<00:03:40.949> orientation<00:03:41.430> a<00:03:41.489> little<00:03:41.699> bit<00:03:41.790> more

00:03:41.990 --> 00:03:42.000 
adjusting orientation a little bit more

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:45.470 
adjusting orientation a little bit more
on<00:03:42.150> on<00:03:42.329> the<00:03:42.569> z<00:03:42.750> axis<00:03:42.889> and<00:03:44.000> now<00:03:45.000> you<00:03:45.060> can<00:03:45.269> see

00:03:45.470 --> 00:03:45.480 
on on the z axis and now you can see

00:03:45.480 --> 00:03:47.689 
on on the z axis and now you can see
that<00:03:45.690> the<00:03:46.410> orientation<00:03:46.980> of<00:03:47.099> the<00:03:47.160> soccer<00:03:47.579> ball

00:03:47.689 --> 00:03:47.699 
that the orientation of the soccer ball

00:03:47.699 --> 00:03:57.559 
that the orientation of the soccer ball
is<00:03:47.970> much<00:03:48.209> better<00:03:54.440> great<00:03:55.440> and<00:03:55.849> from<00:03:56.849> the<00:03:57.090> looks

00:03:57.559 --> 00:03:57.569 
is much better great and from the looks

00:03:57.569 --> 00:03:59.770 
is much better great and from the looks
of<00:03:57.720> things<00:03:57.900> we<00:03:58.199> may<00:03:58.379> not<00:03:58.530> need<00:03:58.709> to<00:03:58.889> set<00:03:59.129> that

00:03:59.770 --> 00:03:59.780 
of things we may not need to set that

00:03:59.780 --> 00:04:04.009 
of things we may not need to set that
that<00:04:00.780> f<00:04:01.049> curves<00:04:01.760> interpolation<00:04:02.760> to<00:04:03.299> linear<00:04:03.810> I

00:04:04.009 --> 00:04:04.019 
that f curves interpolation to linear I

00:04:04.019 --> 00:04:06.710 
that f curves interpolation to linear I
think<00:04:04.260> we'll<00:04:04.980> be<00:04:05.010> just<00:04:05.400> fine<00:04:05.489> without<00:04:06.239> doing

00:04:06.710 --> 00:04:06.720 
think we'll be just fine without doing

00:04:06.720 --> 00:04:10.399 
think we'll be just fine without doing
that<00:04:08.030> great<00:04:09.030> all<00:04:09.780> right<00:04:09.930> so<00:04:10.019> with<00:04:10.139> that<00:04:10.229> said

00:04:10.399 --> 00:04:10.409 
that great all right so with that said

00:04:10.409 --> 00:04:12.589 
that great all right so with that said
we've<00:04:10.590> added<00:04:10.889> some<00:04:11.040> rotation<00:04:11.849> to<00:04:12.120> our<00:04:12.269> soccer

00:04:12.589 --> 00:04:12.599 
we've added some rotation to our soccer

00:04:12.599 --> 00:04:14.449 
we've added some rotation to our soccer
ball<00:04:12.930> we've<00:04:13.139> used<00:04:13.349> auto<00:04:13.590> key<00:04:13.859> so<00:04:14.069> we<00:04:14.099> can<00:04:14.310> get

00:04:14.449 --> 00:04:14.459 
ball we've used auto key so we can get

00:04:14.459 --> 00:04:16.670 
ball we've used auto key so we can get
this<00:04:14.639> done<00:04:14.849> lot<00:04:15.449> faster<00:04:15.840> we<00:04:15.989> also<00:04:16.139> learned<00:04:16.470> how

00:04:16.670 --> 00:04:16.680 
this done lot faster we also learned how

00:04:16.680 --> 00:04:18.860 
this done lot faster we also learned how
to<00:04:16.979> find<00:04:17.609> the<00:04:17.820> true<00:04:18.060> axis<00:04:18.510> that<00:04:18.690> we're

00:04:18.860 --> 00:04:18.870 
to find the true axis that we're

00:04:18.870 --> 00:04:21.589 
to find the true axis that we're
animating<00:04:19.229> in<00:04:19.560> with<00:04:20.519> our<00:04:20.639> rotate<00:04:21.060> tool<00:04:21.269> by

00:04:21.589 --> 00:04:21.599 
animating in with our rotate tool by

00:04:21.599 --> 00:04:23.360 
animating in with our rotate tool by
making<00:04:21.900> sure<00:04:21.959> that<00:04:22.349> the<00:04:22.620> coordinate<00:04:23.310> system

00:04:23.360 --> 00:04:23.370 
making sure that the coordinate system

00:04:23.370 --> 00:04:26.450 
making sure that the coordinate system
is<00:04:23.760> set<00:04:24.000> to<00:04:24.240> gimbal<00:04:24.810> so<00:04:25.500> now<00:04:25.770> we<00:04:25.830> move<00:04:26.159> to<00:04:26.219> the

00:04:26.450 --> 00:04:26.460 
is set to gimbal so now we move to the

00:04:26.460 --> 00:04:27.920 
is set to gimbal so now we move to the
last<00:04:26.940> lesson<00:04:27.210> where<00:04:27.479> we<00:04:27.599> need<00:04:27.780> to

00:04:27.920 --> 00:04:27.930 
last lesson where we need to

00:04:27.930 --> 00:04:29.990 
last lesson where we need to
to<00:04:27.990> add<00:04:28.080> some<00:04:28.350> volume<00:04:28.560> to<00:04:28.979> our<00:04:29.100> ball<00:04:29.310> as<00:04:29.550> it

00:04:29.990 --> 00:04:30.000 
to add some volume to our ball as it

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:32.120 
to add some volume to our ball as it
bounces<00:04:30.240> so<00:04:31.229> in<00:04:31.320> the<00:04:31.380> next<00:04:31.500> lesson<00:04:31.740> what<00:04:32.039> we're

00:04:32.120 --> 00:04:32.130 
bounces so in the next lesson what we're

00:04:32.130 --> 00:04:34.219 
bounces so in the next lesson what we're
going<00:04:32.220> to<00:04:32.340> do<00:04:32.460> is<00:04:32.729> add<00:04:33.090> some<00:04:33.570> squash<00:04:33.990> and

00:04:34.219 --> 00:04:34.229 
going to do is add some squash and

00:04:34.229 --> 00:04:36.650 
going to do is add some squash and
stretch<00:04:34.320> so<00:04:35.100> that<00:04:35.190> ball<00:04:35.400> moves<00:04:35.759> along<00:04:36.150> the

00:04:36.650 --> 00:04:36.660 
stretch so that ball moves along the

00:04:36.660 --> 00:04:38.870 
stretch so that ball moves along the
path
