00:02:09.949 --> 00:02:09.959 
you probably already know guys because

00:02:09.959 --> 00:02:12.890 
you probably already know guys because
you<00:02:10.200> just<00:02:10.590> saw<00:02:10.800> how<00:02:11.160> it<00:02:11.640> was<00:02:11.790> assembled<00:02:12.120> but

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:12.900 
you just saw how it was assembled but

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:13.740 
you just saw how it was assembled but
first

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:13.750 
first

00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:16.170 
first
you<00:02:13.810> take<00:02:14.080> this<00:02:14.560> piece<00:02:14.860> and<00:02:15.100> this<00:02:15.850> piece<00:02:15.940> and

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:16.180 
you take this piece and this piece and

00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:19.530 
you take this piece and this piece and
you<00:02:17.110> put<00:02:17.350> it<00:02:17.440> on<00:02:17.590> like<00:02:17.920> so<00:02:18.210> well<00:02:19.210> you<00:02:19.330> pretty

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:19.540 
you put it on like so well you pretty

00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:20.760 
you put it on like so well you pretty
much<00:02:19.690> put<00:02:19.870> it<00:02:19.990> wherever<00:02:20.110> you<00:02:20.320> want<00:02:20.350> it<00:02:20.620> does

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:20.770 
much put it wherever you want it does

00:02:20.770 --> 00:02:22.620 
much put it wherever you want it does
probably<00:02:20.950> matter<00:02:21.250> but<00:02:21.880> I<00:02:21.940> like<00:02:22.090> to<00:02:22.210> put<00:02:22.360> it<00:02:22.510> on

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:22.630 
probably matter but I like to put it on

00:02:22.630 --> 00:02:26.460 
probably matter but I like to put it on
the<00:02:22.840> left<00:02:23.080> side<00:02:23.610> if<00:02:24.810> you're<00:02:25.810> looking<00:02:26.080> at<00:02:26.260> like

00:02:26.460 --> 00:02:26.470 
the left side if you're looking at like

00:02:26.470 --> 00:02:28.730 
the left side if you're looking at like
that<00:02:26.710> that<00:02:26.980> is<00:02:27.190> and<00:02:27.460> then<00:02:27.700> you<00:02:27.730> put<00:02:28.060> the<00:02:28.330> gun

00:02:28.730 --> 00:02:28.740 
that that is and then you put the gun

00:02:28.740 --> 00:02:33.090 
that that is and then you put the gun
right<00:02:29.740> there<00:02:29.770> on<00:02:30.360> so<00:02:31.360> I<00:02:31.390> can<00:02:31.709> make<00:02:32.709> sure<00:02:32.740> it's

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:33.100 
right there on so I can make sure it's

00:02:33.100 --> 00:02:34.920 
right there on so I can make sure it's
on<00:02:33.160> the<00:02:33.280> same<00:02:33.490> one<00:02:33.700> where<00:02:34.510> it<00:02:34.600> won't<00:02:34.690> look

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:34.930 
on the same one where it won't look

00:02:34.930 --> 00:02:38.790 
on the same one where it won't look
right<00:02:34.990> like<00:02:35.950> if<00:02:36.130> you<00:02:36.250> put<00:02:36.459> it<00:02:36.550> hold<00:02:37.300> on<00:02:37.420> if<00:02:38.350> you

00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:38.800 
right like if you put it hold on if you

00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:40.949 
right like if you put it hold on if you
put<00:02:39.070> it<00:02:39.190> over<00:02:39.520> here<00:02:40.060> it<00:02:40.209> just<00:02:40.600> doesn't<00:02:40.930> look

00:02:40.949 --> 00:02:40.959 
put it over here it just doesn't look

00:02:40.959 --> 00:02:42.900 
put it over here it just doesn't look
right<00:02:41.080> so<00:02:41.530> make<00:02:42.130> sure<00:02:42.160> you<00:02:42.459> put<00:02:42.580> it<00:02:42.700> on<00:02:42.760> the

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:42.910 
right so make sure you put it on the

00:02:42.910 --> 00:02:46.080 
right so make sure you put it on the
same<00:02:43.090> one<00:02:43.360> and<00:02:43.540> then<00:02:44.410> you<00:02:44.560> put<00:02:44.800> this<00:02:45.070> piece<00:02:45.730> the

00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:46.090 
same one and then you put this piece the

00:02:46.090 --> 00:02:48.270 
same one and then you put this piece the
Technic<00:02:46.450> piece<00:02:46.720> right<00:02:47.140> there<00:02:47.410> and<00:02:48.040> then<00:02:48.160> you

00:02:48.270 --> 00:02:48.280 
Technic piece right there and then you

00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:50.130 
Technic piece right there and then you
have<00:02:48.310> your<00:02:48.489> chain<00:02:48.730> gun<00:02:48.940> but<00:02:49.600> how<00:02:49.840> do<00:02:49.900> you<00:02:49.989> put

nifty there nifty um here is the rocket

00:03:06.970 --> 00:03:10.490 
nifty there nifty um here is the rocket
launcher<00:03:07.530> the<00:03:08.530> pieces<00:03:08.950> you<00:03:09.070> need<00:03:09.100> for<00:03:09.520> it<00:03:09.640> are

00:03:10.490 --> 00:03:10.500 
launcher the pieces you need for it are

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:15.270 
launcher the pieces you need for it are
first<00:03:11.500> of<00:03:11.680> all<00:03:11.709> two<00:03:12.190> of<00:03:12.340> these<00:03:14.070> they're<00:03:15.070> like<00:03:15.250> a

00:03:15.270 --> 00:03:15.280 
first of all two of these they're like a

00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:18.180 
first of all two of these they're like a
cylinder<00:03:15.670> piece<00:03:16.500> there's<00:03:17.500> one<00:03:17.799> there's<00:03:18.130> a

00:03:18.180 --> 00:03:18.190 
cylinder piece there's one there's a

00:03:18.190 --> 00:03:21.780 
cylinder piece there's one there's a
piece<00:03:18.400> like<00:03:19.090> this<00:03:19.150> with<00:03:20.140> a<00:03:20.380> shorter<00:03:20.920> end<00:03:21.160> seal

00:03:21.780 --> 00:03:21.790 
piece like this with a shorter end seal

00:03:21.790 --> 00:03:23.400 
piece like this with a shorter end seal
look<00:03:21.970> like<00:03:22.090> the<00:03:22.239> ends<00:03:22.540> a<00:03:22.600> little<00:03:22.690> bit<00:03:22.959> long<00:03:23.170> um

00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:23.410 
look like the ends a little bit long um

00:03:23.410 --> 00:03:26.520 
look like the ends a little bit long um
there's<00:03:24.190> a<00:03:24.250> piece<00:03:24.519> with<00:03:24.880> the<00:03:25.030> shorter<00:03:25.810> end<00:03:25.989> and

00:03:26.520 --> 00:03:26.530 
there's a piece with the shorter end and

00:03:26.530 --> 00:03:27.960 
there's a piece with the shorter end and
I<00:03:26.620> think<00:03:26.920> would<00:03:27.040> work<00:03:27.190> a<00:03:27.340> lot<00:03:27.519> better<00:03:27.700> I<00:03:27.880> just

00:03:27.960 --> 00:03:27.970 
I think would work a lot better I just

00:03:27.970 --> 00:03:30.590 
I think would work a lot better I just
don't<00:03:28.360> have<00:03:28.510> I<00:03:28.810> just<00:03:29.470> don't<00:03:29.620> have<00:03:29.799> two<00:03:30.040> of

00:03:30.590 --> 00:03:30.600 
don't have I just don't have two of

00:03:30.600 --> 00:03:34.800 
don't have I just don't have two of
these<00:03:31.600> colored<00:03:32.019> pieces<00:03:32.560> like<00:03:32.920> that<00:03:33.330> but<00:03:34.330> yeah

00:03:34.800 --> 00:03:34.810 
these colored pieces like that but yeah

00:03:34.810 --> 00:03:36.600 
these colored pieces like that but yeah

00:03:36.600 --> 00:03:36.610 
come on camera focused well it was the

00:03:36.610 --> 00:03:38.520 
come on camera focused well it was the
same<00:03:36.790> same<00:03:37.239> another<00:03:37.630> warning<00:03:37.810> you<00:03:38.290> get<00:03:38.410> the

picture and here is the other piece you
need<00:03:41.860> a<00:03:42.070> telescope<00:03:42.370> type<00:03:43.000> thing<00:03:43.360> and<00:03:44.070> a<00:03:45.120> gun

00:03:46.640 --> 00:03:46.650 
need a telescope type thing and a gun

00:03:46.650 --> 00:03:50.160 
need a telescope type thing and a gun
it's<00:03:47.650> some<00:03:47.829> older<00:03:48.190> clone<00:03:48.489> gun<00:03:48.959> that's<00:03:49.959> what<00:03:50.140> I

00:03:50.160 --> 00:03:50.170 
it's some older clone gun that's what I

00:03:50.170 --> 00:03:53.970 
it's some older clone gun that's what I
use<00:03:50.560> but<00:03:50.890> if<00:03:51.100> you<00:03:52.290> have<00:03:53.290> a<00:03:53.320> different<00:03:53.650> gun<00:03:53.799> you

use but if you have a different gun you
can<00:03:54.130> also<00:03:54.280> use<00:03:54.579> it<00:03:54.820> if<00:03:55.030> it's<00:03:55.269> just<00:03:55.510> a<00:03:55.600> little

00:03:55.710 --> 00:03:55.720

can also use it if it's just a little
pistol<00:03:56.519> so<00:03:57.519> first<00:03:57.790> you<00:03:58.150> take<00:03:58.180> the<00:03:59.280> telescope

00:04:00.270 --> 00:04:00.280 
pistol so first you take the telescope

00:04:00.280 --> 00:04:02.970 
pistol so first you take the telescope
piece<00:04:00.670> and<00:04:00.910> you<00:04:01.570> clip<00:04:01.959> it<00:04:01.989> on<00:04:02.260> the<00:04:02.290> end<00:04:02.590> of<00:04:02.769> the

00:04:02.970 --> 00:04:02.980 
piece and you clip it on the end of the

00:04:02.980 --> 00:04:06.750 
piece and you clip it on the end of the
gun<00:04:03.130> like<00:04:03.579> so<00:04:03.850> um<00:04:05.250> make<00:04:06.250> sure<00:04:06.280> you<00:04:06.459> don't<00:04:06.579> put

00:04:06.750 --> 00:04:06.760

00:04:08.580 --> 00:04:08.590 
it on the opposite end of the gun also

00:04:08.590 --> 00:04:13.650 
it on the opposite end of the gun also
then<00:04:09.430> you<00:04:09.640> take<00:04:10.560> about<00:04:11.560> this<00:04:12.040> piece<00:04:12.480> and<00:04:13.480> put

00:04:13.650 --> 00:04:13.660 
then you take about this piece and put

00:04:13.660 --> 00:04:16.949 
then you take about this piece and put
it<00:04:13.690> on<00:04:13.870> like<00:04:14.110> so<00:04:15.150> make<00:04:16.150> sure<00:04:16.180> you<00:04:16.419> don't<00:04:16.630> do<00:04:16.810> it

00:04:16.949 --> 00:04:16.959 
it on like so make sure you don't do it

00:04:16.959 --> 00:04:18.990 
it on like so make sure you don't do it
like<00:04:17.470> that<00:04:17.530> or<00:04:17.979> it<00:04:18.100> won't<00:04:18.190> stay<00:04:18.459> on<00:04:18.489> it's<00:04:18.820> good

00:04:18.990 --> 00:04:19.000 
like that or it won't stay on it's good

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:22.680 
like that or it won't stay on it's good
it<00:04:19.150> it'll<00:04:19.450> just<00:04:19.690> fall<00:04:19.840> off<00:04:20.109> and<00:04:21.270> then<00:04:22.270> you<00:04:22.450> take

00:04:22.680 --> 00:04:22.690 
it it'll just fall off and then you take

00:04:22.690 --> 00:04:24.779 
it it'll just fall off and then you take
the<00:04:22.840> other<00:04:23.020> piece<00:04:23.320> and<00:04:23.650> you<00:04:24.070> clip<00:04:24.370> it<00:04:24.400> on<00:04:24.610> the

00:04:24.779 --> 00:04:24.789 
the other piece and you clip it on the

00:04:24.789 --> 00:04:25.360 
the other piece and you clip it on the
end

00:04:25.360 --> 00:04:25.370 
end

00:04:34.270 --> 00:04:34.280 
those two weapons that you showed you um

00:04:34.280 --> 00:04:37.230 
those two weapons that you showed you um
whoa<00:04:34.729> there<00:04:35.389> once<00:04:35.630> the<00:04:35.750> jetpack<00:04:36.199> dude<00:04:36.500> um

00:04:37.230 --> 00:04:37.240 
whoa there once the jetpack dude um

whoa there once the jetpack dude um
those<00:04:38.240> two<00:04:38.389> ovens<00:04:38.570> I<00:04:38.750> showed<00:04:38.930> you<00:04:39.080> were<00:04:39.260> in

00:04:39.490 --> 00:04:39.500 
those two ovens I showed you were in

00:04:39.500 --> 00:04:43.890 
those two ovens I showed you were in
like<00:04:39.860> your<00:04:40.010> Star<00:04:40.220> Wars<00:04:40.430> 3<00:04:40.820> the<00:04:41.660> Clone<00:04:41.990> Wars<00:04:42.020> and

like your Star Wars 3 the Clone Wars and
that<00:04:44.900> is<00:04:45.050> how<00:04:45.430> the<00:04:46.430> models<00:04:46.940> for<00:04:47.900> those<00:04:48.050> two

00:04:48.280 --> 00:04:48.290 
that is how the models for those two

00:04:48.290 --> 00:04:51.600 
that is how the models for those two
weapons<00:04:48.620> were<00:04:48.770> made<00:04:48.800> come<00:04:49.639> on<00:04:49.760> camera<00:04:50.030> focus

00:04:51.600 --> 00:04:51.610 
weapons were made come on camera focus

00:04:51.610 --> 00:04:55.150 
weapons were made come on camera focus
there<00:04:52.610> you<00:04:52.729> go<00:04:53.260> so<00:04:54.260> yeah<00:04:54.410> that's<00:04:54.680> where<00:04:54.830> I<00:04:54.889> got

00:04:55.150 --> 00:04:55.160 
there you go so yeah that's where I got

00:04:55.160 --> 00:04:56.800 
there you go so yeah that's where I got
the<00:04:55.310> two<00:04:55.490> ideas<00:04:55.820> for<00:04:55.970> that<00:04:56.120> and<00:04:56.330> then<00:04:56.540> this<00:04:56.660> is

00:04:56.800 --> 00:04:56.810 
the two ideas for that and then this is

00:04:56.810 --> 00:05:00.159 
the two ideas for that and then this is
just<00:04:56.840> one<00:04:57.199> design<00:04:57.590> of<00:04:57.710> jetpack<00:04:58.240> I<00:04:59.240> know<00:04:59.840> it's

00:05:00.159 --> 00:05:00.169 
just one design of jetpack I know it's

00:05:00.169 --> 00:05:02.170 
just one design of jetpack I know it's
kind<00:05:00.350> of<00:05:00.410> hard<00:05:00.620> to<00:05:00.680> acquire<00:05:01.040> an<00:05:01.370> actual<00:05:01.910> Lego

00:05:02.170 --> 00:05:02.180 
kind of hard to acquire an actual Lego

00:05:02.180 --> 00:05:05.320 
kind of hard to acquire an actual Lego
jetpack<00:05:02.780> for<00:05:03.080> a<00:05:03.139> clone<00:05:03.470> so<00:05:04.220> I<00:05:04.250> decided<00:05:04.940> to<00:05:05.120> show

00:05:05.320 --> 00:05:05.330 
jetpack for a clone so I decided to show

00:05:05.330 --> 00:05:09.100 
jetpack for a clone so I decided to show
you<00:05:05.389> how<00:05:05.690> I<00:05:05.720> made<00:05:06.260> my<00:05:06.740> own<00:05:07.450> back<00:05:08.450> in<00:05:08.660> the<00:05:08.780> days

00:05:09.100 --> 00:05:09.110 
you how I made my own back in the days

00:05:09.110 --> 00:05:12.730 
you how I made my own back in the days
before<00:05:09.440> we<00:05:10.370> had<00:05:10.520> those<00:05:10.729> kind<00:05:11.000> of<00:05:11.060> jetpacks<00:05:11.740> so

00:05:12.730 --> 00:05:12.740 
before we had those kind of jetpacks so

00:05:12.740 --> 00:05:15.430 
before we had those kind of jetpacks so
how<00:05:13.550> does<00:05:13.610> it<00:05:13.940> work<00:05:14.090> well<00:05:14.600> you're<00:05:15.200> gonna<00:05:15.350> need

00:05:15.430 --> 00:05:15.440 
how does it work well you're gonna need

00:05:15.440 --> 00:05:18.460 
how does it work well you're gonna need
one<00:05:15.800> of<00:05:15.830> this<00:05:15.979> backpack<00:05:16.280> pieces<00:05:17.030> and<00:05:18.020> if

00:05:18.460 --> 00:05:18.470 
one of this backpack pieces and if

00:05:18.470 --> 00:05:21.219 
one of this backpack pieces and if
you're<00:05:18.919> not<00:05:19.090> familiar<00:05:20.090> with<00:05:20.510> this<00:05:20.690> piece<00:05:20.930> it

00:05:21.219 --> 00:05:21.229 
you're not familiar with this piece it

00:05:21.229 --> 00:05:25.810 
you're not familiar with this piece it
just<00:05:21.889> clips<00:05:22.070> on<00:05:22.280> to<00:05:22.550> the<00:05:23.289> to<00:05:24.289> the<00:05:24.580> neck<00:05:25.580> right

just clips on to the to the neck right
there<00:05:25.880> and<00:05:26.840> this<00:05:27.560> is<00:05:27.620> how<00:05:27.830> it<00:05:27.949> looks<00:05:28.100> like<00:05:28.389> then

00:05:29.379 --> 00:05:29.389 
there and this is how it looks like then

00:05:29.389 --> 00:05:34.770 
there and this is how it looks like then
you<00:05:29.479> clip<00:05:29.690> it<00:05:29.810> on<00:05:29.900> there<00:05:30.610> you<00:05:31.610> take<00:05:32.950> this<00:05:33.950> piece

00:05:34.770 --> 00:05:34.780 
you clip it on there you take this piece

00:05:34.780 --> 00:05:39.879 
you clip it on there you take this piece
this<00:05:35.780> isn't<00:05:36.139> really<00:05:36.289> a<00:05:36.410> very<00:05:37.060> a<00:05:38.680> piece<00:05:39.680> that

00:05:39.879 --> 00:05:39.889 
this isn't really a very a piece that

00:05:39.889 --> 00:05:41.469 
this isn't really a very a piece that
comes<00:05:40.100> in<00:05:40.250> a<00:05:40.310> lot<00:05:40.490> of<00:05:40.580> sets<00:05:40.789> it's<00:05:41.000> kind<00:05:41.210> of<00:05:41.270> rare

00:05:41.469 --> 00:05:41.479 
comes in a lot of sets it's kind of rare

00:05:41.479 --> 00:05:44.680 
comes in a lot of sets it's kind of rare
and<00:05:41.960> you<00:05:42.620> clip<00:05:42.830> on<00:05:42.979> his<00:05:43.220> back<00:05:43.490> like<00:05:43.520> so<00:05:44.000> make

00:05:44.680 --> 00:05:44.690 
and you clip on his back like so make

00:05:44.690 --> 00:05:46.420 
and you clip on his back like so make
sure<00:05:45.020> you<00:05:45.260> clip<00:05:45.560> it<00:05:45.590> see<00:05:45.950> where<00:05:46.099> that<00:05:46.190> little

00:05:46.420 --> 00:05:46.430 
sure you clip it see where that little

00:05:46.430 --> 00:05:48.820 
sure you clip it see where that little
circle<00:05:46.849> is<00:05:47.060> that's<00:05:47.750> where<00:05:48.020> you<00:05:48.260> would<00:05:48.380> clip<00:05:48.680> it

00:05:48.820 --> 00:05:48.830 
circle is that's where you would clip it

00:05:48.830 --> 00:05:53.140 
circle is that's where you would clip it
on<00:05:49.010> or<00:05:49.970> else<00:05:50.120> it'll<00:05:50.360> look<00:05:51.010> lopsided<00:05:52.010> in<00:05:52.729> all

00:05:53.140 --> 00:05:53.150 
on or else it'll look lopsided in all

00:05:53.150 --> 00:05:58.650 
on or else it'll look lopsided in all
like<00:05:53.810> so<00:05:54.080> um<00:05:55.599> so<00:05:56.599> then<00:05:56.840> whoops<00:05:57.349> whoops<00:05:58.099> whoops

00:05:58.650 --> 00:05:58.660 
like so um so then whoops whoops whoops

00:05:58.660 --> 00:06:00.909 
like so um so then whoops whoops whoops
then<00:05:59.660> you<00:05:59.870> should<00:06:00.050> probably<00:06:00.169> put<00:06:00.530> his<00:06:00.710> head<00:06:00.889> on

00:06:00.909 --> 00:06:00.919 
then you should probably put his head on

00:06:00.919 --> 00:06:04.839 
then you should probably put his head on
legs<00:06:01.310> like<00:06:01.820> this<00:06:02.830> over<00:06:03.830> it<00:06:03.889> I<00:06:04.190> know<00:06:04.400> kind<00:06:04.760> of

00:06:04.839 --> 00:06:04.849 
legs like this over it I know kind of

00:06:04.849 --> 00:06:06.610 
legs like this over it I know kind of
looks<00:06:04.970> weird<00:06:05.120> like<00:06:05.419> his<00:06:05.570> head's<00:06:05.810> like<00:06:06.139> above

00:06:06.610 --> 00:06:06.620 
looks weird like his head's like above

00:06:06.620 --> 00:06:08.409 
looks weird like his head's like above
his<00:06:06.770> neck<00:06:06.950> but<00:06:07.190> really<00:06:07.880> it's<00:06:08.000> fine

00:06:08.409 --> 00:06:08.419 
his neck but really it's fine

00:06:08.419 --> 00:06:13.120 
his neck but really it's fine
and<00:06:08.510> then<00:06:09.320> you<00:06:09.680> put<00:06:11.050> here<00:06:12.050> this<00:06:12.590> was<00:06:12.800> the<00:06:12.830> piece

00:06:13.120 --> 00:06:13.130 
and then you put here this was the piece

00:06:13.130 --> 00:06:15.879 
and then you put here this was the piece
I<00:06:13.280> showed<00:06:13.460> you<00:06:13.580> earlier<00:06:13.630> like<00:06:14.630> I<00:06:14.780> said<00:06:15.050> if<00:06:15.650> you

00:06:15.879 --> 00:06:15.889 
I showed you earlier like I said if you

00:06:15.889 --> 00:06:19.779 
I showed you earlier like I said if you
have<00:06:16.099> a<00:06:16.130> shorter<00:06:17.530> it's<00:06:18.530> kind<00:06:18.950> of<00:06:19.010> shorter<00:06:19.310> that

00:06:19.779 --> 00:06:19.789 
have a shorter it's kind of shorter that

00:06:19.789 --> 00:06:22.240 
have a shorter it's kind of shorter that
kind<00:06:20.120> of<00:06:20.180> piece<00:06:20.360> then<00:06:20.840> I'd<00:06:21.320> use<00:06:21.380> that<00:06:21.710> rather

00:06:22.240 --> 00:06:22.250 
kind of piece then I'd use that rather

00:06:22.250 --> 00:06:25.810 
kind of piece then I'd use that rather
than<00:06:22.490> this<00:06:22.700> and<00:06:23.440> then<00:06:24.440> you<00:06:24.590> put<00:06:25.160> the<00:06:25.280> stud<00:06:25.610> on

00:06:25.810 --> 00:06:25.820 
than this and then you put the stud on

00:06:25.820 --> 00:06:27.790 
than this and then you put the stud on
the<00:06:25.880> end<00:06:26.120> to<00:06:26.270> make<00:06:26.419> sure<00:06:26.570> it's<00:06:26.750> a<00:06:26.840> blue<00:06:27.260> stud<00:06:27.590> it

00:06:27.790 --> 00:06:27.800 
the end to make sure it's a blue stud it

00:06:27.800 --> 00:06:29.680 
the end to make sure it's a blue stud it
doesn't<00:06:28.099> have<00:06:28.220> to<00:06:28.370> be<00:06:28.490> dark<00:06:28.729> blue<00:06:28.970> light<00:06:29.660> blue
