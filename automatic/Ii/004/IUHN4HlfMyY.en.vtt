00:00:02.880 --> 00:00:08.200
 this play button let's use a piece 

00:00:05.230 --> 00:00:10.269
 of cardboard we will cut a rectangle what 

00:00:08.200 --> 00:00:13.089
 we mark 

00:00:10.269 --> 00:00:14.980
 and of course we cut it here 

00:00:13.089 --> 00:00:18.029
 cut this off we just have to 

00:00:14.980 --> 00:00:18.029
 round the corners 

00:00:18.860 --> 00:00:23.840
 this is in accordance with the result 

00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:25.460
 they are going to take a piece of rubber to carry a 

00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:27.710
 little bigger of course color 

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:30.040
 red or the color they want all the 

00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:33.700
 cardboard and they will mark their outline 

00:00:30.040 --> 00:00:33.700
 let's do the outline 

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:38.540
 and we cut 

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:38.540
 to 

00:00:39.339 --> 00:00:43.850
 perfect now let's go back to the cardboard to 

00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:45.500
 we will stick a piece of white paper a 

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:48.550
 slightly smaller than the Carton 

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:48.550
 we will fix with glue in bar 

00:00:49.210 --> 00:00:53.680
 and this will serve for the final effect 

00:00:51.160 --> 00:00:56.170
 let's see with this small piece of cardboard 

00:00:53.680 --> 00:01:00.030
 stone let's draw a triangle not 

00:00:56.170 --> 00:01:00.030
 it necessarily has to be perfect 

00:01:00.130 --> 00:01:04.690
 when you agree of course cut out 

00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:07.240
 all of that now they simply place the 

00:01:04.690 --> 00:01:11.360
 cardboard triangle in the center of this 

00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:13.950
 more or less out there and what brand 

00:01:11.360 --> 00:01:16.860
 and we cut it with this 

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:19.920
 has been cut only we removed the 

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:21.960
 triangle left and is as alive the 

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:24.899
 we are going to paste on the cardboard that 

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:29.119
 we have prepared and we paste it 

00:01:24.899 --> 00:01:29.119
 course with our glue in bar 

00:01:31.300 --> 00:01:36.160
 they have already finished their play button is 

00:01:34.030 --> 00:01:38.050
 too simple in fact very difficult 

00:01:36.160 --> 00:01:39.700
 wrong now the only thing they have 

00:01:38.050 --> 00:01:41.980
 what to do to be able to paste what is 

00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:45.490
 next we flipped it and in the part of 

00:01:41.980 --> 00:01:47.680
 back we stick a couple of masking strips 

00:01:45.490 --> 00:01:51.880
 we wind up like this for the part of the 

00:01:47.680 --> 00:01:55.740
 glue there is another here and we are already 

00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:55.740
 ready to stick it 

00:01:57.400 --> 00:02:00.090
 to 

00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:03.070
 ah 

00:02:10.570 --> 00:02:14.290
 but they are more than 30 

00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:20.990
 enough very easy to do very simple 

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:23.000
 and as a decorative element you can not see 

00:02:20.990 --> 00:02:25.490
 they can also vary and they can place the 

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:27.230
 scope button the pause button with the 

00:02:25.490 --> 00:02:28.880
 same technique can do a lot of 

00:02:27.230 --> 00:02:32.380
 things now if you want to go back to the video 

00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:32.380
 of the first times apart 

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:43.600
