00:00:22.269 --> 00:00:22.279 
air and then we draw two other circles

00:00:22.279 --> 00:00:26.150 
air and then we draw two other circles
just<00:00:23.279> let<00:00:23.490> the<00:00:23.609> top<00:00:23.789> tier<00:00:24.800> move<00:00:25.800> that<00:00:25.980> one<00:00:26.130> over

00:06:39.530 --> 00:06:39.540 
then we just wait for the ink to dry

00:06:39.540 --> 00:06:41.580 
then we just wait for the ink to dry
then<00:06:40.540> we<00:06:40.600> just<00:06:40.750> go<00:06:40.870> back<00:06:41.020> in<00:06:41.170> and<00:06:41.260> rub<00:06:41.380> out<00:06:41.500> the

00:06:41.580 --> 00:06:41.590 
then we just go back in and rub out the

00:06:41.590 --> 00:06:48.510 
then we just go back in and rub out the
pencil<00:06:41.920> lines<00:06:46.710> so<00:06:47.710> there<00:06:47.860> you<00:06:47.920> have<00:06:48.100> a<00:06:48.130> little
