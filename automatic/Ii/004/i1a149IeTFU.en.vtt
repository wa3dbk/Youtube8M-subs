 with everything necessary for the mode 

00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:13.860
 first we do not want to have a 

00:01:11.590 --> 00:01:13.860
 Spider 

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:25.240
 I've been to the spider is the line that 

00:01:22.990 --> 00:01:27.790
 he asks them spider sorry my pronunciation 

00:01:25.240 --> 00:01:30.100
 English that follows exactly the same as 

00:01:27.790 --> 00:01:32.490
 normal spider what happens that I think that 

00:01:30.100 --> 00:01:32.490
 They are equal 

00:01:33.189 --> 00:01:37.689
 our difference but I'm left with 

00:01:35.150 --> 00:01:37.689
 this 

00:01:38.350 --> 00:01:42.549
 Well I'm staying with this one because I like it 

00:01:40.360 --> 00:01:45.159
 more ok to close the doors there is no 

00:01:42.549 --> 00:01:49.680
 good door 

00:01:45.159 --> 00:01:54.980
 and this will also help us 

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:57.600
 the flesh of lady spider foot spider 

00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:58.920
 clicks we have to tame the how 

00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:01.290
 horses need apples this 

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:03.360
 you need your own meat you can use 

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:05.880
 with any kind of meat from minecraft 

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:09.179
 from little ones of certain until meat 

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:11.610
 rotten up props I recommend it 

00:02:09.179 --> 00:02:13.680
 with chickens because they are more sadistic 

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:14.870
 still to kill ok but good what 

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:17.390
 you want 

00:02:14.870 --> 00:02:19.549
 and one we have this meat we can 

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:22.400
 transform lara world ends if you go 

00:02:19.549 --> 00:02:24.459
 sobrados and vice by forgetting thus thrown away 

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:27.459
 ingots 

00:02:24.459 --> 00:02:27.459
 inserted 

00:02:28.510 --> 00:02:33.310
 Thomas ingots spiders everywhere 

00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:36.040
 everywhere, as is not the case, we are going to 

00:02:33.310 --> 00:02:39.879
 do it also we also stay to 

00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:41.739
 carnitas let's tame the clyfc a 

00:02:39.879 --> 00:02:43.659
 click two click with a click what already 

00:02:41.739 --> 00:02:45.069
 enough to domesticate won and we have 

00:02:43.659 --> 00:02:47.799
 the spider diagnosed no longer us 

00:02:45.069 --> 00:02:50.200
 They will attack and will not be anything right no 

00:02:47.799 --> 00:02:52.659
 we will analyze our saddle for riding 

00:02:50.200 --> 00:02:55.390
 the spider is made with leather 

00:02:52.659 --> 00:02:57.250
 exactly 11 of leather we have to 

00:02:55.390 --> 00:03:00.909
 make the point of offering a pair of trousers 

00:02:57.250 --> 00:03:02.290
 leather and another iron and with this then 

00:03:00.909 --> 00:03:06.129
 let's open these five tests to do 

00:03:02.290 --> 00:03:07.720
 the rest is a little traffic this 

00:03:06.129 --> 00:03:10.569
 but hey it came very well to the year already 

00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:13.180
 you will see once we have the chair 

00:03:10.569 --> 00:03:16.590
 we achieve shift 

00:03:13.180 --> 00:03:19.590
 Right click with no object the hand 

00:03:16.590 --> 00:03:20.760
 we put the saddle and as you see 

00:03:19.590 --> 00:03:22.920
 you already have the saddle already 

00:03:20.760 --> 00:03:25.050
 we can ride in it so when going 

00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:29.519
 shit through the door, I'm not very 

00:03:25.050 --> 00:03:31.170
 ready that I am ready, we all have 

00:03:29.519 --> 00:03:33.330
 australia to carry when we of the 

00:03:31.170 --> 00:03:35.459
 canine which is what makes it more beautiful 

00:03:33.330 --> 00:03:38.519
 like a horse then look we do 

00:03:35.459 --> 00:03:41.730

00:03:38.519 --> 00:03:44.340

00:03:49.260 --> 00:03:55.300
 done with nothing in the hand and to the module 

00:03:51.690 --> 00:04:00.240
 good leather is not bad I do not like it 

00:03:55.300 --> 00:04:00.240

00:04:01.769 --> 00:04:09.640
 and work I know if I eat horses but 

00:04:08.230 --> 00:04:12.250
 What I like the most to me are those of 

00:04:09.640 --> 00:04:16.359
 diamond and gold because as I say 

00:04:12.250 --> 00:04:18.959

00:04:16.359 --> 00:04:18.959

00:04:23.730 --> 00:04:28.780
 and that's it 

00:04:26.110 --> 00:04:34.230

00:04:54.140 --> 00:04:58.280
 in addition to a height block there the 

00:04:57.560 --> 00:05:01.130

00:04:58.280 --> 00:05:03.880

00:05:01.130 --> 00:05:10.160
 climb walls as if we were here 

00:05:03.880 --> 00:05:13.190
