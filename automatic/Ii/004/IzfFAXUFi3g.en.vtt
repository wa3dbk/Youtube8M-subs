00:00:25.689 --> 00:00:29.080 

there's<00:00:26.689> a<00:00:26.750> lot<00:00:26.930> of<00:00:26.960> confusion<00:00:27.529> between<00:00:28.090> XSL

00:00:29.080 --> 00:00:29.090 
there's a lot of confusion between XSL

00:00:29.090 --> 00:00:33.819 
there's a lot of confusion between XSL
and<00:00:30.160> CSS<00:00:31.180> CSS<00:00:32.180> is<00:00:32.629> cascading<00:00:33.260> style<00:00:33.530> sheets

00:00:33.819 --> 00:00:33.829 
and CSS CSS is cascading style sheets

00:00:33.829 --> 00:00:36.330 
and CSS CSS is cascading style sheets
and<00:00:34.059> XSL<00:00:35.059> is<00:00:35.300> extensible<00:00:36.050> stylesheet

00:00:36.330 --> 00:00:36.340 
and XSL is extensible stylesheet

00:00:36.340 --> 00:00:39.040 
and XSL is extensible stylesheet
transform<00:00:37.340> language<00:00:37.489> so<00:00:38.239> right<00:00:38.420> there<00:00:38.629> in<00:00:38.870> the

00:00:39.040 --> 00:00:39.050 
transform language so right there in the

00:00:39.050 --> 00:00:40.930 
transform language so right there in the
in<00:00:39.410> the<00:00:39.530> titles<00:00:39.890> of<00:00:39.980> those<00:00:40.100> two<00:00:40.340> you<00:00:40.489> can<00:00:40.640> see

00:00:40.930 --> 00:00:40.940 
in the titles of those two you can see

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:42.280 
in the titles of those two you can see
why<00:00:41.210> there<00:00:41.449> might<00:00:41.629> be<00:00:41.660> some<00:00:41.960> confusion

00:00:42.280 --> 00:00:42.290 
why there might be some confusion

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:45.100 
why there might be some confusion
they're<00:00:43.160> both<00:00:43.430> called<00:00:43.790> style<00:00:44.269> sheets<00:00:44.570> inside

00:00:45.100 --> 00:00:45.110 
they're both called style sheets inside

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:47.410 
they're both called style sheets inside
of<00:00:45.379> transforms<00:00:46.040> in<00:00:46.190> fact<00:00:46.400> we<00:00:46.610> have<00:00:46.790> the<00:00:47.030> style

00:00:47.410 --> 00:00:47.420 
of transforms in fact we have the style

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:49.090 
of transforms in fact we have the style
sheet<00:00:47.720> element<00:00:48.140> that's<00:00:48.290> the<00:00:48.470> root<00:00:48.650> element<00:00:49.040> of

00:00:49.090 --> 00:00:49.100 
sheet element that's the root element of

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:51.310 
sheet element that's the root element of
every<00:00:49.250> transform<00:00:49.970> so<00:00:50.750> what<00:00:51.019> is<00:00:51.140> the

00:00:51.310 --> 00:00:51.320 
every transform so what is the

00:00:51.320 --> 00:00:54.969 
every transform so what is the
difference<00:00:51.440> between<00:00:51.680> XSL<00:00:52.489> and<00:00:52.760> CSS<00:00:53.720> and<00:00:53.979> when

00:00:54.969 --> 00:00:54.979 
difference between XSL and CSS and when

00:00:54.979 --> 00:00:56.380 
difference between XSL and CSS and when
would<00:00:55.129> you<00:00:55.159> use<00:00:55.280> one<00:00:55.670> when<00:00:55.879> would<00:00:56.000> you<00:00:56.030> use<00:00:56.239> the

00:00:56.380 --> 00:00:56.390 
would you use one when would you use the

00:00:56.390 --> 00:00:58.630 
would you use one when would you use the
other<00:00:56.540> so<00:00:57.260> let's<00:00:57.409> first<00:00:57.619> start<00:00:57.890> with<00:00:58.309> a<00:00:58.339> brief

00:00:58.630 --> 00:00:58.640 
other so let's first start with a brief

00:00:58.640 --> 00:01:00.189 
other so let's first start with a brief
definition<00:00:58.940> of<00:00:59.449> each<00:00:59.570> of<00:00:59.720> those<00:00:59.809> and<00:01:00.049> then<00:01:00.110> I

00:01:00.189 --> 00:01:00.199 
definition of each of those and then I

00:01:00.199 --> 00:01:01.479 
definition of each of those and then I
think<00:01:00.500> from<00:01:00.680> the<00:01:00.769> definition<00:01:01.250> it'll<00:01:01.400> be

00:01:01.479 --> 00:01:01.489 
think from the definition it'll be

00:01:01.489 --> 00:01:03.549 
think from the definition it'll be
pretty<00:01:01.699> clear<00:01:02.150> what<00:01:02.659> the<00:01:02.780> relationship<00:01:03.350> is

00:01:03.549 --> 00:01:03.559 
pretty clear what the relationship is

00:01:03.559 --> 00:01:05.680 
pretty clear what the relationship is
and<00:01:03.979> when<00:01:04.549> you<00:01:04.729> should<00:01:04.909> use<00:01:04.940> one<00:01:05.330> and<00:01:05.479> when<00:01:05.570> you

00:01:05.680 --> 00:01:05.690 
and when you should use one and when you

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:09.130 
and when you should use one and when you
should<00:01:05.869> use<00:01:05.900> another<00:01:06.549> CSS<00:01:07.780> cascading<00:01:08.780> style

00:01:09.130 --> 00:01:09.140 
should use another CSS cascading style

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:12.580 
should use another CSS cascading style
sheets<00:01:09.439> was<00:01:09.920> invented<00:01:10.490> to<00:01:11.150> do<00:01:11.750> away<00:01:11.869> with<00:01:12.080> the

00:01:12.580 --> 00:01:12.590 
sheets was invented to do away with the

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:15.609 
sheets was invented to do away with the
proliferation<00:01:12.950> of<00:01:13.540> attributes<00:01:14.540> on<00:01:14.780> HTML<00:01:15.320> tags

00:01:15.609 --> 00:01:15.619 
proliferation of attributes on HTML tags

00:01:15.619 --> 00:01:18.550 
proliferation of attributes on HTML tags
that<00:01:16.159> were<00:01:16.310> there<00:01:16.610> to<00:01:16.869> fine-tune<00:01:17.869> the<00:01:17.900> display

00:01:18.550 --> 00:01:18.560 
that were there to fine-tune the display

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:22.480 
that were there to fine-tune the display
so<00:01:19.430> as<00:01:19.760> time<00:01:20.390> went<00:01:20.420> on<00:01:20.659> with<00:01:20.900> with<00:01:21.170> HTML<00:01:21.740> more

00:01:22.480 --> 00:01:22.490 
so as time went on with with HTML more

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:24.039 
so as time went on with with HTML more
and<00:01:22.610> more<00:01:22.759> attributes<00:01:23.330> were<00:01:23.509> being<00:01:23.780> added

00:01:24.039 --> 00:01:24.049 
and more attributes were being added

00:01:24.049 --> 00:01:27.550 
and more attributes were being added
simply<00:01:24.500> to<00:01:24.920> do<00:01:25.420> formatting<00:01:26.420> things<00:01:26.720> to<00:01:27.200> a<00:01:27.230> tag

00:01:27.550 --> 00:01:27.560 
simply to do formatting things to a tag

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:30.400 
simply to do formatting things to a tag
and<00:01:27.970> those<00:01:28.970> formatting<00:01:29.510> things<00:01:29.750> just<00:01:29.990> got<00:01:30.140> too

00:01:30.400 --> 00:01:30.410 
and those formatting things just got too

00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:33.430 
and those formatting things just got too
complex<00:01:30.920> and<00:01:31.190> so<00:01:31.730> CSS<00:01:32.240> was<00:01:32.480> invented<00:01:32.930> as<00:01:33.080> a<00:01:33.110> way

00:01:33.430 --> 00:01:33.440 
complex and so CSS was invented as a way

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:35.890 
complex and so CSS was invented as a way
to<00:01:33.500> do<00:01:34.460> away<00:01:34.610> with<00:01:34.760> all<00:01:35.240> the<00:01:35.420> attributes

00:01:35.890 --> 00:01:35.900 
to do away with all the attributes

00:01:35.900 --> 00:01:37.510 
to do away with all the attributes
having<00:01:36.200> to<00:01:36.290> do<00:01:36.380> with<00:01:36.500> formatting<00:01:37.070> and<00:01:37.190> instead

00:01:37.510 --> 00:01:37.520 
having to do with formatting and instead

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:39.970 
having to do with formatting and instead
instead<00:01:37.820> centralize<00:01:38.750> all<00:01:39.110> the<00:01:39.409> formatting

00:01:39.970 --> 00:01:39.980 
instead centralize all the formatting

00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:43.120 
instead centralize all the formatting
code<00:01:40.250> and<00:01:40.520> commands<00:01:41.000> in<00:01:41.120> one<00:01:41.659> place<00:01:41.960> the<00:01:42.650> CSS

00:01:43.120 --> 00:01:43.130 
code and commands in one place the CSS

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:46.120 
code and commands in one place the CSS
file<00:01:43.420> thing<00:01:44.420> but<00:01:44.870> the<00:01:45.020> CSS<00:01:45.650> I<00:01:45.770> think<00:01:45.980> is

00:01:46.120 --> 00:01:46.130 
file thing but the CSS I think is

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:48.190 
file thing but the CSS I think is
actually<00:01:46.700> a<00:01:46.760> very<00:01:46.940> good<00:01:47.120> idea

00:01:48.190 --> 00:01:48.200 
actually a very good idea

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:50.140 
actually a very good idea
I<00:01:48.260> complained<00:01:49.100> a<00:01:49.220> little<00:01:49.370> bit<00:01:49.610> about<00:01:49.790> the<00:01:49.940> file

00:01:50.140 --> 00:01:50.150 
I complained a little bit about the file

00:01:50.150 --> 00:01:52.480 
I complained a little bit about the file
format<00:01:50.630> since<00:01:50.870> it's<00:01:51.110> a<00:01:51.260> bizarre<00:01:51.500> file<00:01:52.040> format

00:01:52.480 --> 00:01:52.490 
format since it's a bizarre file format

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:53.980 
format since it's a bizarre file format
and<00:01:52.670> there's<00:01:52.940> no<00:01:53.030> other<00:01:53.180> file<00:01:53.450> format<00:01:53.840> I<00:01:53.870> know

00:01:53.980 --> 00:01:53.990 
and there's no other file format I know

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:57.570 
and there's no other file format I know
that<00:01:54.320> works<00:01:54.620> like<00:01:55.070> that<00:01:55.100> it's<00:01:55.880> kind<00:01:56.180> of<00:01:56.270> like<00:01:56.479> a

00:01:57.570 --> 00:01:57.580 
that works like that it's kind of like a

00:01:57.580 --> 00:02:00.310 
that works like that it's kind of like a
C++<00:01:58.580> configuration<00:01:59.360> file<00:01:59.630> or<00:01:59.900> something<00:02:00.110> like

00:02:00.310 --> 00:02:00.320 
C++ configuration file or something like

00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:03.219 
C++ configuration file or something like
that<00:02:00.380> it's<00:02:00.770> a<00:02:00.920> it's<00:02:01.760> really<00:02:01.820> not<00:02:02.180> it's<00:02:02.930> really

that it's a it's really not it's really

00:02:03.229 --> 00:02:05.700 
that it's a it's really not it's really

not an easy file format to understand

00:02:05.710 --> 00:02:08.649 
not an easy file format to understand
but<00:02:06.710> it<00:02:06.890> does<00:02:07.130> carry<00:02:07.549> all<00:02:07.970> of<00:02:08.509> the

but it does carry all of the

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:20.930 
that's all carried out in a CSS file so

00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:23.199 
that's all carried out in a CSS file so
a<00:02:20.959> CSS<00:02:21.500> file<00:02:21.769> is<00:02:21.950> something<00:02:22.310> that<00:02:22.489> website

00:02:23.199 --> 00:02:23.209 
a CSS file is something that website

00:02:23.209 --> 00:02:25.630 
a CSS file is something that website
designer<00:02:23.599> uses<00:02:24.170> in<00:02:24.409> order<00:02:24.890> to<00:02:24.980> figure<00:02:25.280> out<00:02:25.430> how

00:02:25.630 --> 00:02:25.640 
designer uses in order to figure out how

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:27.970 
designer uses in order to figure out how
everything<00:02:25.819> should<00:02:26.330> look<00:02:26.480> and<00:02:26.629> feel<00:02:26.900> we<00:02:27.769> won't

00:02:27.970 --> 00:02:27.980 
everything should look and feel we won't

00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:29.949 
everything should look and feel we won't
go<00:02:28.099> into<00:02:28.280> CSS<00:02:28.849> in<00:02:29.000> any<00:02:29.150> more<00:02:29.360> detail<00:02:29.750> than<00:02:29.900> that

00:02:29.949 --> 00:02:29.959 
go into CSS in any more detail than that

00:02:29.959 --> 00:02:31.690 
go into CSS in any more detail than that
I<00:02:30.110> just<00:02:30.409> want<00:02:30.590> you<00:02:30.709> to<00:02:30.739> realize<00:02:31.040> that<00:02:31.279> you'll

00:02:31.690 --> 00:02:31.700 
I just want you to realize that you'll

00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:34.030 
I just want you to realize that you'll
see<00:02:31.969> CSS<00:02:32.510> a<00:02:32.540> lot<00:02:32.810> and<00:02:32.989> you<00:02:33.529> should<00:02:33.709> be<00:02:33.799> able<00:02:33.889> to

00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:34.040 
see CSS a lot and you should be able to

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:35.800 
see CSS a lot and you should be able to
get<00:02:34.249> into<00:02:34.459> CSS<00:02:34.879> as<00:02:35.090> you<00:02:35.480> need

00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:35.810 
get into CSS as you need

00:02:35.810 --> 00:02:37.930 
get into CSS as you need
in<00:02:36.140> order<00:02:36.500> to<00:02:36.530> make<00:02:36.800> display<00:02:37.280> things<00:02:37.520> happen

00:02:37.930 --> 00:02:37.940 
in order to make display things happen

00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:40.840 
in order to make display things happen
or<00:02:38.180> in<00:02:38.390> order<00:02:38.540> to<00:02:38.720> decode<00:02:39.709> the<00:02:39.890> CSS<00:02:40.370> files<00:02:40.640> that

00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:40.850 
or in order to decode the CSS files that

00:02:40.850 --> 00:02:42.580 
or in order to decode the CSS files that
you<00:02:40.970> see<00:02:41.209> that<00:02:41.569> are<00:02:41.690> that's<00:02:41.990> in<00:02:42.200> the<00:02:42.290> work<00:02:42.440> that

00:02:42.580 --> 00:02:42.590 
you see that are that's in the work that

00:02:42.590 --> 00:02:45.490 
you see that are that's in the work that
you'll<00:02:42.709> use<00:02:42.890> in<00:02:42.920> this<00:02:43.100> class<00:02:43.750> so<00:02:44.750> CSS<00:02:45.290> was

00:02:45.490 --> 00:02:45.500 
you'll use in this class so CSS was

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:49.120 
you'll use in this class so CSS was
invented<00:02:45.980> specifically<00:02:46.910> to<00:02:47.690> centralize<00:02:48.650> and

00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:49.130 
invented specifically to centralize and

00:02:49.130 --> 00:02:52.300 
invented specifically to centralize and
standardize<00:02:49.940> and<00:02:50.360> leverage<00:02:51.050> the<00:02:51.709> styling

00:02:52.300 --> 00:02:52.310 
standardize and leverage the styling

00:02:52.310 --> 00:02:53.770 
standardize and leverage the styling
that<00:02:52.340> happens<00:02:52.850> in<00:02:53.000> a<00:02:53.090> webpage

00:02:53.770 --> 00:02:53.780 
that happens in a webpage

00:02:53.780 --> 00:02:57.430 
that happens in a webpage
now<00:02:54.470> what's<00:02:54.830> XSL<00:02:55.459> for<00:02:55.870> XSL<00:02:56.870> extensible

00:02:57.430 --> 00:02:57.440 
now what's XSL for XSL extensible

00:02:57.440 --> 00:03:01.360 
now what's XSL for XSL extensible
stylesheet<00:02:57.790> transforms<00:02:58.790> are<00:02:59.200> there<00:03:00.200> to<00:03:00.560> take

00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:01.370 
stylesheet transforms are there to take

00:03:01.370 --> 00:03:04.900 
stylesheet transforms are there to take
xml<00:03:02.060> and<00:03:02.270> turn<00:03:03.050> it<00:03:03.200> into<00:03:03.350> something<00:03:04.340> else<00:03:04.610> and

00:03:04.900 --> 00:03:04.910 
xml and turn it into something else and

00:03:04.910 --> 00:03:06.910 
xml and turn it into something else and
of<00:03:05.540> course<00:03:05.810> in<00:03:05.959> our<00:03:06.080> case<00:03:06.290> to<00:03:06.470> something<00:03:06.770> else

00:03:06.910 --> 00:03:06.920 
of course in our case to something else

00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:10.060 
of course in our case to something else
is<00:03:07.069> usually<00:03:07.489> HTML<00:03:08.209> so<00:03:08.780> that<00:03:08.810> the<00:03:09.320> XS<00:03:09.890> l's

00:03:10.060 --> 00:03:10.070 
is usually HTML so that the XS l's

00:03:10.070 --> 00:03:13.690 
is usually HTML so that the XS l's
transforms<00:03:11.019> transform<00:03:12.019> XML<00:03:12.739> into<00:03:13.340> something

00:03:13.690 --> 00:03:13.700 
transforms transform XML into something

00:03:13.700 --> 00:03:14.710 
transforms transform XML into something
else<00:03:13.820> and<00:03:14.000> of<00:03:14.060> course<00:03:14.239> that<00:03:14.360> is<00:03:14.480> something

00:03:14.710 --> 00:03:14.720 
else and of course that is something

00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:16.810 
else and of course that is something
else<00:03:14.900> could<00:03:15.050> also<00:03:15.260> be<00:03:15.650> another<00:03:16.010> form<00:03:16.280> of<00:03:16.400> XML

00:03:16.810 --> 00:03:16.820 
else could also be another form of XML

00:03:16.820 --> 00:03:18.990 
else could also be another form of XML
so<00:03:17.750> what's<00:03:18.019> the<00:03:18.230> relationship<00:03:18.440> between

00:03:18.990 --> 00:03:19.000 
so what's the relationship between

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:23.100 
so what's the relationship between
transforming<00:03:20.000> XML<00:03:20.510> into<00:03:21.410> let's<00:03:21.920> say<00:03:22.010> HTML<00:03:22.730> and

00:03:23.100 --> 00:03:23.110 
transforming XML into let's say HTML and

00:03:23.110 --> 00:03:27.240 
transforming XML into let's say HTML and
styling<00:03:24.110> HTML<00:03:24.910> well<00:03:25.910> clearly<00:03:26.510> they're

00:03:27.240 --> 00:03:27.250 
styling HTML well clearly they're

00:03:27.250 --> 00:03:30.250 
styling HTML well clearly they're
related<00:03:28.250> both<00:03:29.090> of<00:03:29.360> them<00:03:29.510> are<00:03:29.660> about<00:03:29.930> getting

00:03:30.250 --> 00:03:30.260 
related both of them are about getting

00:03:30.260 --> 00:03:32.320 
related both of them are about getting
output<00:03:30.980> from<00:03:31.250> an<00:03:31.370> XML<00:03:31.730> file<00:03:31.970> to<00:03:32.000> display

00:03:32.320 --> 00:03:32.330 
output from an XML file to display

00:03:32.330 --> 00:03:35.650 
output from an XML file to display
nicely<00:03:33.170> on<00:03:33.350> a<00:03:33.380> computer<00:03:33.890> screen<00:03:34.010> the<00:03:34.819> CSS<00:03:35.330> part

00:03:35.650 --> 00:03:35.660 
nicely on a computer screen the CSS part

00:03:35.660 --> 00:03:39.340 
nicely on a computer screen the CSS part
happens<00:03:36.110> after<00:03:36.860> the<00:03:37.250> XSL<00:03:37.790> part<00:03:38.090> the<00:03:38.540> XSL<00:03:39.019> part

00:03:39.340 --> 00:03:39.350 
happens after the XSL part the XSL part

00:03:39.350 --> 00:03:42.550 
happens after the XSL part the XSL part
creates<00:03:39.769> the<00:03:39.980> HTML<00:03:40.489> tags<00:03:40.850> the<00:03:41.630> CSS<00:03:42.230> part

00:03:42.550 --> 00:03:42.560 
creates the HTML tags the CSS part

00:03:42.560 --> 00:03:44.530 
creates the HTML tags the CSS part
formats<00:03:43.340> those<00:03:43.579> tags<00:03:43.940> with<00:03:44.150> the<00:03:44.180> look<00:03:44.420> and

00:03:44.530 --> 00:03:44.540 
formats those tags with the look and

00:03:44.540 --> 00:03:46.060 
formats those tags with the look and
feel<00:03:44.750> that<00:03:44.780> you<00:03:45.019> want<00:03:45.230> to<00:03:45.320> have<00:03:45.470> on<00:03:45.650> your<00:03:45.799> site

00:03:46.060 --> 00:03:46.070 
feel that you want to have on your site

00:03:46.070 --> 00:03:51.220 
feel that you want to have on your site
so<00:03:47.170> XSL<00:03:48.310> transforms<00:03:49.310> 8<00:03:49.519> XML<00:03:50.120> tags<00:03:50.420> into<00:03:50.630> HTML

00:03:51.220 --> 00:03:51.230 
so XSL transforms 8 XML tags into HTML

00:03:51.230 --> 00:03:54.250 
so XSL transforms 8 XML tags into HTML
tags<00:03:51.500> CSS<00:03:52.489> takes<00:03:52.820> those<00:03:53.030> HTML<00:03:53.630> tags<00:03:53.900> and<00:03:54.140> then

00:03:54.250 --> 00:03:54.260 
tags CSS takes those HTML tags and then

00:03:54.260 --> 00:03:55.900 
tags CSS takes those HTML tags and then
styles<00:03:54.739> them<00:03:54.920> the<00:03:55.070> way<00:03:55.160> you<00:03:55.190> want<00:03:55.549> to<00:03:55.640> style

00:03:55.900 --> 00:03:55.910 
styles them the way you want to style

00:03:55.910 --> 00:04:00.120 
styles them the way you want to style
them<00:03:56.090> more<00:03:57.049> fundamentally<00:03:58.150> XSL<00:03:59.150> is<00:03:59.420> all<00:03:59.720> about

00:04:00.120 --> 00:04:00.130 
them more fundamentally XSL is all about

00:04:00.130 --> 00:04:02.860 
them more fundamentally XSL is all about
changing<00:04:01.130> the<00:04:01.400> tagging<00:04:01.910> changing<00:04:02.420> the<00:04:02.600> nature

the authoring engine oxygen for example

00:05:37.070 --> 00:05:38.890 
the authoring engine oxygen for example
I<00:05:37.580> think<00:05:37.700> oxygen<00:05:38.300> will<00:05:38.390> do<00:05:38.480> this<00:05:38.570> I<00:05:38.630> haven't

00:05:38.890 --> 00:05:38.900

tried<00:05:39.080> but<00:05:39.350> certainly<00:05:39.890> products<00:05:40.820> like

00:05:40.930 --> 00:05:40.940 
tried but certainly products like

tried but certainly products like
x-metal<00:05:41.330> will<00:05:41.570> do<00:05:41.690> this<00:05:41.870> will<00:05:42.470> take<00:05:42.740> the<00:05:42.770> CSS

00:05:43.480 --> 00:05:43.490 
x-metal will do this will take the CSS

00:05:43.490 --> 00:05:46.870 
x-metal will do this will take the CSS
and<00:05:43.760> figure<00:05:44.570> out<00:05:44.600> how<00:05:45.050> to<00:05:45.110> make<00:05:45.590> the<00:05:46.160> XML

00:05:46.870 --> 00:05:46.880 
and figure out how to make the XML

00:05:46.880 --> 00:05:51.160 
and figure out how to make the XML
WYSIWYG<00:05:47.870> so<00:05:48.590> if<00:05:49.040> you<00:05:49.250> have<00:05:49.460> a<00:05:49.490> table<00:05:50.090> in<00:05:50.450> XML

00:05:51.160 --> 00:05:51.170 
WYSIWYG so if you have a table in XML

00:05:51.170 --> 00:05:52.990 
WYSIWYG so if you have a table in XML
it'll<00:05:51.530> actually<00:05:51.680> format<00:05:52.400> it<00:05:52.550> like<00:05:52.700> a<00:05:52.730> table

00:05:52.990 --> 00:05:53.000 
it'll actually format it like a table

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:56.050 
it'll actually format it like a table
and<00:05:53.270> the<00:05:53.630> CSS<00:05:54.050> is<00:05:54.230> used<00:05:54.440> to<00:05:54.560> do<00:05:54.680> that<00:05:54.830> so<00:05:55.550> CSS

00:05:56.050 --> 00:05:56.060 
and the CSS is used to do that so CSS

00:05:56.060 --> 00:05:59.380 
and the CSS is used to do that so CSS
for<00:05:56.300> styling<00:05:56.710> XSL<00:05:57.710> for<00:05:58.010> transformation<00:05:58.820> but

00:05:59.380 --> 00:05:59.390 
for styling XSL for transformation but

00:05:59.390 --> 00:06:01.030 
for styling XSL for transformation but
sometimes<00:05:59.930> we<00:06:00.140> collide<00:06:00.500> them<00:06:00.710> back<00:06:00.860> together

00:06:01.030 --> 00:06:01.040 
sometimes we collide them back together

00:06:01.040 --> 00:06:04.900 
sometimes we collide them back together
again<00:06:01.550> and<00:06:01.730> put<00:06:02.270> CSS<00:06:02.540> style<00:06:03.110> tags<00:06:03.470> on<00:06:03.770> XS<00:06:04.730> on

00:06:04.900 --> 00:06:04.910 
again and put CSS style tags on XS on

00:06:04.910 --> 00:06:08.020 
again and put CSS style tags on XS on
XML<00:06:05.540> elements<00:06:06.350> and<00:06:06.500> then<00:06:06.980> some<00:06:07.250> layout<00:06:07.610> engine

00:06:08.020 --> 00:06:08.030 
XML elements and then some layout engine

00:06:08.030 --> 00:06:10.810 
XML elements and then some layout engine
makes<00:06:08.600> put<00:06:09.080> some<00:06:09.230> styling<00:06:09.830> around<00:06:10.220> the<00:06:10.370> XML

00:06:10.810 --> 00:06:10.820 
makes put some styling around the XML

makes put some styling around the XML
