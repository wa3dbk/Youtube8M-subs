00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.720
 this morning from the Kazan station in 

00:00:01.979 --> 00:00:04.920
 its first flight went new 

00:00:03.720 --> 00:00:05.700
 double decker train enhanced 

00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:07.950
 comfort 

00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:09.660
 Moscow Adler composition designed 

00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:11.460
 launched specifically for the upcoming Olympiad 

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:12.929
 what is supposed to be on it from 

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:14.910
 Moscow in Sochi is the bulk 

00:00:12.929 --> 00:00:19.310
 tourists and fans I'm on Leontyeva 

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:22.140
 accompanied the first passengers can now 

00:00:19.310 --> 00:00:25.230
 will hear you the world would not be them 

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:26.460
 my bottom leg business foot straps up to 3 

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:29.960
 has created 

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:31.970
 wind kilometers between Moscow and the fire 

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:33.770
 such tall monsters have entered into 

00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:35.870
 exploitation not for the sake of exotic 

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:37.970
 but in order to transport almost two 

00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:40.160
 times more passengers at a time and on such 

00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:42.110
 busy direction like moscow adler 

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:44.239
 there was no shortage of tickets anymore 

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:46.190
 similar transport concept 

00:00:44.239 --> 00:00:47.989
 passenger seals 

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:50.210
 railroad cars already 

00:00:47.989 --> 00:00:52.309
 developed a century ago then were 

00:00:50.210 --> 00:00:53.930
 built double-deck cars that 

00:00:52.309 --> 00:00:54.739
 used to relocate the peasants 

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:56.690
 to Siberia 

00:00:54.739 --> 00:00:58.790
 later in the Soviet Union in such 

00:00:56.690 --> 00:01:00.890
 trains did not need them 

00:00:58.790 --> 00:01:03.230
 production was stopped and here 

00:01:00.890 --> 00:01:05.000
 Now two-level compositions again 

00:01:03.230 --> 00:01:10.100
 hit the road in solemn 

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:12.909
 environment under the camera flashes for it 

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:15.220
 45 days to departure 

00:01:12.909 --> 00:01:18.510
 today was 

00:01:15.220 --> 00:01:20.380
 kind of ninety-three percent ticket and 

00:01:18.510 --> 00:01:23.830
 departure from Moscow 

00:01:20.380 --> 00:01:26.100
 they are attached only 700 places at 

00:01:23.830 --> 00:01:27.000
 train departure from the station 

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:29.790
 success 

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:32.090
 Lera's blood will explain everything from the train will 

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:33.210
 use all tickets at once 

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:35.520
 at home 

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:37.470
 travel lovers eyeing 

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:40.020
 the landscape outside the window will be a little surprised 

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:41.820
 trailers run swinging and passengers 

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:43.740
 it does not sway at all until 

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:46.290
 the traditional knock of the wheels is now barely 

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:48.180
 after hearing the whole thing in good sound insulation 

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:50.780
 and sealed international 

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:50.780
 transitions 

00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:57.410
 more 

00:01:55.040 --> 00:01:59.360
 people who don't travel often 

00:01:57.410 --> 00:02:01.670
 Europe will be surprised by magnetic locks on 

00:01:59.360 --> 00:02:02.510
 coupe doors will delight mini-kitchens with 

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:04.850
 microwave 

00:02:02.510 --> 00:02:07.190
 but the main thing in this train is certainly not this 

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:09.170
 and the fact that it is only in the car and become higher 

00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:12.290
 ticket prices for this destination 

00:02:09.170 --> 00:02:14.600
 decreased by 20 30 percent exactly this 

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:17.240
 causes passengers increased interest and
