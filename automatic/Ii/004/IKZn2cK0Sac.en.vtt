00:00:00.540 --> 00:00:05.069
 hello very good everyone I'm maximan and 

00:00:03.570 --> 00:00:07.439
 good as the previous video I said that 

00:00:05.069 --> 00:00:09.990
 we reached the 300 likes and I gave you 

00:00:07.439 --> 00:00:12.450
 helped get this car good 

00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:13.769
 I am very very happy even so there is no 

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:16.230
 have reached that figure 

00:00:13.769 --> 00:00:18.570
 I am very happy for the participation 

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:19.950
 of all my subscribers and all the whole 

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:22.290
 support that you are giving me day by day 

00:00:19.950 --> 00:00:24.380
 all those likes that you give me and good 

00:00:22.290 --> 00:00:26.520
 I thought it was not going to get that much but 

00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:28.490
 day to day because I'm realizing 

00:00:26.520 --> 00:00:30.710
 what 

00:00:28.490 --> 00:00:32.870
 overcoming each of up to where 

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:35.320
 you can get to where you want 

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:37.760
 where are you going to arrive so nothing more than 

00:00:35.320 --> 00:00:39.920
 to say that this car does not get 

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:42.670
 with no type of letters or with any 

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:44.750
 Type of piece is only what you need 

00:00:42.670 --> 00:00:47.330
 you need someone who has it so that 

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:49.160
 everything duplicates how it duplicates then to 

00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:51.970
 we are going 

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:51.970
 we are going to 

00:00:52.150 --> 00:00:57.280
 we have a car is worth the personal car 

00:00:54.460 --> 00:01:00.730
 that is not yours needs to be the pilot 

00:00:57.280 --> 00:01:02.600
 of the vehicle then I need to do the 

00:01:00.730 --> 00:01:07.930
 pilot 

00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:11.260
 this car was not mine then I amount 

00:01:07.930 --> 00:01:13.090
 in the vehicle the pilot the owner of 

00:01:11.260 --> 00:01:15.940
 vehicle then stays outside or stays 

00:01:13.090 --> 00:01:18.280
 very important co-pilot mounted 

00:01:15.940 --> 00:01:20.590
 you need us to be the pilot of the 

00:01:18.280 --> 00:01:23.229
 vehicle that you want to duplicate you call 

00:01:20.590 --> 00:01:25.510
 gerald asks yesterday to ask for a 

00:01:23.229 --> 00:01:26.770
 mission to gerard because because from the 

00:01:25.510 --> 00:01:28.119
 fastest missions are made 

00:01:26.770 --> 00:01:30.090
 then already if you have the car 

00:01:28.119 --> 00:01:32.789
 directly 

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:34.229
 what more then nothing get us in the mission 

00:01:32.789 --> 00:01:37.130
 the owner of the car has to be 

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:39.659
 also and just after 

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:43.039
 directly because there you have the car and 

00:01:39.659 --> 00:01:43.039
 is yours so 

00:01:43.440 --> 00:01:49.370
 that is your car once got into the 

00:01:47.370 --> 00:01:52.740
 mission what we have to do is 

00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:56.370
 press the start button 

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:58.950
 look on the map for your house that is not 

00:01:56.370 --> 00:02:01.020
 marked I recommend you to put a 

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:03.180
 point of interest or something so that what 

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:07.890
 you know 

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:10.229
 nothing to mark it and take it to the garage one 

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:12.900
 Once arrived at the garage, what 

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:15.180
 I put in fast speed 

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:17.410
 we go fast fast fast home 

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:19.230
 we leave the mission apart 

00:02:17.410 --> 00:02:22.769
 Y 

00:02:19.230 --> 00:02:25.709
 let's go let's go let's go let's go there 

00:02:22.769 --> 00:02:29.280
 you see how he came in he replaced a vehicle 

00:02:25.709 --> 00:02:31.290
 that arrived directly does not matter and 

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:32.730
 you have the car ends in the broadcast and 

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:36.480
 you already have the car stored in the garage 

00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:38.250
 for everyone it is to say that I have many 

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:41.849
 Friendship requests that most are 

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:43.980
 Guiris are French that with whom I 

00:02:41.849 --> 00:02:47.160
 I have arrived playing the useful heat 

00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:48.870
 so what I'm going to do is I'm going to 

00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:51.329
 Remove all friend requests 

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:55.739
 and all the friendships I'm going to renew all 

00:02:51.329 --> 00:02:58.200

00:02:55.739 --> 00:03:00.599
 friends that I have with whom I do not play 

00:02:58.200 --> 00:03:03.660

00:03:03.660 --> 00:03:07.079

 you already have here the car no vision and 

00:03:07.079 --> 00:03:10.469
 you have the car leave the vision 

00:03:08.549 --> 00:03:13.219
