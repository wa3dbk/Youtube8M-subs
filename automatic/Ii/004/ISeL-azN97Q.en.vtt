old<00:03:02.620> too<00:03:02.890> and<00:03:03.310> I<00:03:03.400> debated<00:03:03.610> whether<00:03:03.880> or<00:03:04.240> not<00:03:04.360> I

00:03:04.410 --> 00:03:04.420 
old too and I debated whether or not I

00:03:42.990 --> 00:03:43.000 
because I saw him come up from the

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:45.030 
because I saw him come up from the
distance<00:03:43.330> and<00:03:43.480> he<00:03:43.540> looked<00:03:43.720> pretty<00:03:43.810> big<00:03:44.080> but

00:03:45.030 --> 00:03:45.040 
distance and he looked pretty big but

00:03:45.040 --> 00:03:46.500 
distance and he looked pretty big but
once<00:03:45.340> I<00:03:45.430> got<00:03:45.580> a<00:03:45.610> better<00:03:45.790> look<00:03:45.880> at<00:03:46.150> him<00:03:46.270> he<00:03:46.390> had<00:03:46.480> a

00:03:46.500 --> 00:03:46.510 
once I got a better look at him he had a

00:03:46.510 --> 00:03:48.600 
once I got a better look at him he had a
young<00:03:46.900> body<00:03:47.200> so<00:03:47.530> I<00:03:47.620> figured<00:03:47.920> I'd<00:03:48.040> let<00:03:48.070> him<00:03:48.370> go

00:03:48.600 --> 00:03:48.610

young body so I figured I'd let him go
and<00:03:49.330> not<00:03:49.540> take<00:03:49.900> a<00:03:49.930> shot<00:03:50.200> at<00:03:50.380> him<00:03:50.470> but<00:03:50.680> just<00:03:51.160> like
