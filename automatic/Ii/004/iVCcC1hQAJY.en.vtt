I've<00:02:21.120> actually<00:02:21.300> done<00:02:21.570> everything<00:02:21.959> from

00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:22.140 
I've actually done everything from

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:24.830 
I've actually done everything from
healing<00:02:22.560> on<00:02:22.920> this<00:02:23.160> which<00:02:23.340> I<00:02:23.459> find<00:02:23.730> almost<00:02:24.480> as

00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:24.840 
healing on this which I find almost as

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:27.320 
healing on this which I find almost as
easy<00:02:25.020> as<00:02:25.170> doing<00:02:25.470> it<00:02:25.560> on<00:02:25.620> the<00:02:25.709> computer<00:02:26.330> it's

00:02:27.320 --> 00:02:27.330 
easy as doing it on the computer it's

00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:30.949 
easy as doing it on the computer it's
not<00:02:27.540> very<00:02:27.930> much<00:02:28.110> difficult<00:02:29.420> you<00:02:30.420> know<00:02:30.510> it'll

00:02:30.949 --> 00:02:30.959 
not very much difficult you know it'll

00:02:30.959 --> 00:02:34.040 
not very much difficult you know it'll
be<00:02:31.170> easier<00:02:31.500> if<00:02:31.590> you<00:02:31.650> had<00:02:31.860> like<00:02:32.100> a<00:02:32.160> icon<00:02:33.030> I<00:02:33.420> don't

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:34.050 
be easier if you had like a icon I don't

00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:35.120 
be easier if you had like a icon I don't
or<00:02:34.260> something<00:02:34.530> like<00:02:34.650> that

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:35.130 
or something like that

00:02:35.130 --> 00:02:36.920 
or something like that
so<00:02:35.610> you<00:02:35.700> could<00:02:35.850> have<00:02:35.970> the<00:02:36.090> icons<00:02:36.450> a<00:02:36.570> little<00:02:36.810> bit

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:36.930 
so you could have the icons a little bit

00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:37.940 
so you could have the icons a little bit
bigger<00:02:37.110> because<00:02:37.260> that's<00:02:37.500> the<00:02:37.560> only<00:02:37.620> problem

00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:37.950 
bigger because that's the only problem

00:02:37.950 --> 00:02:40.130 
bigger because that's the only problem
that<00:02:37.980> I<00:02:38.070> really<00:02:38.310> run<00:02:38.459> into<00:02:38.760> I<00:02:38.940> mean<00:02:39.750> they're

00:02:40.130 --> 00:02:40.140 
that I really run into I mean they're

00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:41.330 
that I really run into I mean they're
definitely<00:02:40.350> pressable<00:02:40.860> and<00:02:41.100> they're<00:02:41.190> easily

00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:41.340 
definitely pressable and they're easily

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:44.060 
definitely pressable and they're easily
pressable<00:02:42.110> but<00:02:43.110> I<00:02:43.380> mean<00:02:43.560> it<00:02:43.739> could<00:02:43.890> be<00:02:44.040> a

00:02:44.060 --> 00:02:44.070 
pressable but I mean it could be a

00:02:44.070 --> 00:02:45.860 
pressable but I mean it could be a
little<00:02:44.250> bit<00:02:44.400> easier<00:02:44.760> on<00:02:45.030> an<00:02:45.330> add-on<00:02:45.510> that<00:02:45.810> you

00:02:45.860 --> 00:02:45.870 
little bit easier on an add-on that you

00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:47.360 
little bit easier on an add-on that you
could<00:02:46.020> increase<00:02:46.200> the<00:02:46.380> size<00:02:46.590> of<00:02:46.620> them<00:02:46.860> which

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:47.370 
could increase the size of them which

00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:53.449 
could increase the size of them which
there<00:02:47.640> are<00:02:50.300> pretty<00:02:51.300> much<00:02:51.920> yeah<00:02:52.920> well<00:02:53.160> the<00:02:53.250> fork

00:02:53.449 --> 00:02:53.459 
there are pretty much yeah well the fork

00:02:53.459 --> 00:02:56.900 
there are pretty much yeah well the fork
