00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:25.670 
and I was a thought that he'd be
something<00:02:24.270> like<00:02:24.390> to<00:02:24.750> scar<00:02:25.080> no<00:02:25.260> I<00:02:25.380> thought<00:02:25.560> he'd

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:25.680 
something like to scar no I thought he'd

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:28.700 
something like to scar no I thought he'd
be<00:02:25.860> so<00:02:26.310> slow<00:02:26.730> 79<00:02:27.360> sprint<00:02:27.690> speed<00:02:27.870> a<00:02:27.930> bit<00:02:28.170> like<00:02:28.410> to

00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:28.710 
be so slow 79 sprint speed a bit like to

00:02:28.710 --> 00:02:30.230

wing<00:02:32.160> up<00:02:32.310> but<00:02:32.550> i<00:02:32.700> thought<00:02:32.910> we'd<00:02:33.060> make<00:02:33.240> up<00:02:33.480> for

00:02:33.710 --> 00:02:33.720 
wing up but i thought we'd make up for

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:36.050 
wing up but i thought we'd make up for
it<00:02:33.780> with<00:02:33.840> his<00:02:34.200> shooting<00:02:34.560> and<00:02:35.010> his<00:02:35.760> strength

and to be honest he got muscled off the

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:40.730 
and to be honest he got muscled off the
ball<00:02:38.610> so<00:02:38.940> much<00:02:38.970> so<00:02:39.810> many<00:02:39.990> times<00:02:40.200> he<00:02:40.380> just<00:02:40.530> fell

00:03:19.710 --> 00:03:20.750 
right position for me did play slightly
better<00:03:19.860> when<00:03:20.100> i<00:03:20.160> stopped<00:03:20.400> and<00:03:20.520> wanted<00:03:20.700> to

00:03:20.750 --> 00:03:20.760 
better when i stopped and wanted to

00:03:20.760 --> 00:03:22.550

really<00:03:25.290> disappointing<00:03:26.010> player<00:03:26.220> and<00:03:26.460> for<00:03:27.390> the

00:03:27.470 --> 00:03:27.480 
really disappointing player and for the

00:03:27.480 --> 00:03:31.010 
really disappointing player and for the
sort<00:03:27.720> of<00:03:27.780> 70<00:03:28.470> k<00:03:28.860> 6<00:03:29.280> 65<00:03:29.820> 70<00:03:30.240> k<00:03:30.360> gonna<00:03:30.540> pay<00:03:30.750> for<00:03:30.930> him

00:03:31.010 --> 00:03:31.020 
sort of 70 k 6 65 70 k gonna pay for him

00:03:31.020 --> 00:03:33.350 
sort of 70 k 6 65 70 k gonna pay for him
they're<00:03:31.530> much<00:03:31.920> better<00:03:32.160> options<00:03:32.670> and<00:03:32.850> I'd

00:03:33.350 --> 00:03:33.360 
they're much better options and I'd

00:03:33.360 --> 00:03:35.780 
they're much better options and I'd
rather<00:03:33.690> try<00:03:34.020> other<00:03:34.230> players<00:03:34.530> so<00:03:35.130> overall<00:03:35.550> do<00:03:35.730> I

00:03:35.780 --> 00:03:35.790 
rather try other players so overall do I

00:03:35.790 --> 00:03:37.820 
rather try other players so overall do I
think<00:03:35.850> is<00:03:36.060> worth<00:03:36.300> it<00:03:36.570> well<00:03:37.080> this<00:03:37.440> may<00:03:37.620> be<00:03:37.680> a<00:03:37.740> bit

00:03:37.820 --> 00:03:37.830 
think is worth it well this may be a bit

00:03:37.830 --> 00:03:39.500 
think is worth it well this may be a bit
shorter<00:03:38.250> mother<00:03:38.400> reviews<00:03:38.760> because<00:03:38.910> i<00:03:39.000> do<00:03:39.300> not

00:03:39.500 --> 00:03:39.510 
shorter mother reviews because i do not

00:03:39.510 --> 00:03:41.030 
shorter mother reviews because i do not
have<00:03:39.840> enough<00:03:39.990> gameplay<00:03:40.560> with<00:03:40.710> him<00:03:40.830> and<00:03:41.010> that

00:03:41.030 --> 00:03:41.040 
have enough gameplay with him and that

00:03:41.040 --> 00:03:42.830 
have enough gameplay with him and that
kind<00:03:41.850> of<00:03:41.880> shows<00:03:42.090> thing<00:03:42.300> for<00:03:42.480> that<00:03:42.570> have<00:03:42.660> enough

00:03:42.830 --> 00:03:42.840 
kind of shows thing for that have enough

00:03:42.840 --> 00:03:44.840 
kind of shows thing for that have enough
gameplay<00:03:43.260> with<00:03:43.440> so<00:03:43.560> on<00:03:43.680> it<00:03:43.800> usually<00:03:44.340> tells<00:03:44.640> you

00:03:44.840 --> 00:03:44.850 
gameplay with so on it usually tells you

00:03:48.860 --> 00:03:48.870 
the players I've lost the game play for

00:03:48.870 --> 00:03:51.080 
the players I've lost the game play for
I've<00:03:49.050> enjoyed<00:03:49.320> using<00:03:49.560> them<00:03:49.830> and<00:03:50.090> they're

00:03:51.080 --> 00:03:51.090 
I've enjoyed using them and they're

00:03:51.090 --> 00:03:53.840 
I've enjoyed using them and they're
pretty<00:03:51.360> good<00:03:51.540> but<00:03:52.260> he<00:03:52.620> was<00:03:52.770> awful<00:03:53.220> I<00:03:53.340> didn't

00:03:53.840 --> 00:03:53.850 
pretty good but he was awful I didn't

00:03:53.850 --> 00:03:55.820 
pretty good but he was awful I didn't
really<00:03:54.180> like<00:03:54.480> him<00:03:54.720> at<00:03:54.810> all<00:03:55.050> he<00:03:55.380> just<00:03:55.410> felt

00:03:55.820 --> 00:03:55.830 
really like him at all he just felt

00:03:55.830 --> 00:03:58.940 
really like him at all he just felt
really<00:03:56.130> sluggish<00:03:56.580> and<00:03:57.260> he's<00:03:58.260> shooting<00:03:58.800> was

00:03:58.940 --> 00:03:58.950 
really sluggish and he's shooting was

00:03:58.950 --> 00:04:00.140 
really sluggish and he's shooting was
not<00:03:58.980> as<00:03:59.340> good<00:03:59.520> as<00:03:59.580> I<00:03:59.640> thought<00:03:59.760> it<00:03:59.940> would<00:03:59.970> be

00:04:00.140 --> 00:04:00.150 
not as good as I thought it would be

new<00:04:17.400> ones<00:04:17.549> probably<00:04:17.700> ought<00:04:17.880> to<00:04:17.970> know<00:04:18.090> with

bit of a challenge try and review some

00:04:21.330 --> 00:04:23.300 
bit of a challenge try and review some
defenders<00:04:21.840> maybe<00:04:22.350> like<00:04:22.500> Mary<00:04:22.770> Apple<00:04:23.100> and<00:04:23.280> the

00:04:23.300 --> 00:04:23.310
