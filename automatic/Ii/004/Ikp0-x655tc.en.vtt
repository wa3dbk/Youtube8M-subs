00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.629
 Hello to you, I Vova quieter and vsky 

00:00:03.300 --> 00:00:10.650
 Now I would like to share a small 

00:00:05.629 --> 00:00:12.450
 information about galaxy 6 and 6 edge and what 

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:14.309
 I like what kind of device my 

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:16.350
 liked more based on what you 

00:00:14.309 --> 00:00:19.080
 already seen a number of videos on my 

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:21.199
 I told the channel and the possibilities 

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:23.250
 cameras and wireless charging and 

00:00:21.199 --> 00:00:25.680
 showed you the camera capabilities 

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:27.720
 compared with fifth compared with note 

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:30.660
 edge compared with different devices 

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:35.180
 By the way, by shooting this video, I'm on not edge 

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:37.649
 so that you understand what is not on your camera 

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:39.420
 well and quality is different 

00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:42.960
 pictures you too i understand that 

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:44.879
 see different and i like to here 

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:46.680
 literally that is, it will be somewhat 

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:49.079
 A full comparison just how much 

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:53.000
 reasoning that I'm more all the same 

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:58.199
 I liked what device it is well 

00:00:53.000 --> 00:01:01.469
 which one is an example I would choose right away 

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:03.930
 I want to say that of course galaxy s6 edge 

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:06.030
 which is now left he 

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:09.020
 interesting here is this curved screen and 

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:11.369
 left and right and accordingly gives 

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:15.210
 certain as if additional 

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:17.189
 functional and accordingly you get 

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:19.680
 how would they firstly brand new 

00:01:17.189 --> 00:01:21.810
 device is not like you used to see 

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:25.020
 usually yes that is galaxy s6 

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:26.759
 This can be said on the form factor epos 

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:30.659
 especially glass form factor 

00:01:26.759 --> 00:01:32.790
 front window is a normal device and s6 

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:35.250
 edge is how will something new and 

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:36.570
 given that it is not much more expensive 

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:40.409
 than with 

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:42.720
 At 6, many are now even eyeing 

00:01:40.409 --> 00:01:46.350
 to acquire exactly s6 edge because 

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:49.020
 well wow cool this is interesting i want it i 

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:52.350
 I want to buy myself s-6h many and 

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:57.360
 reason but I will say that there are a number 

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:59.490
 people who for example but say yes no 

00:01:57.360 --> 00:02:04.320
 well this is of course cool well i need 

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:05.880
 out of 6 I immediately run ahead and rather 

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:09.690
 just choose from 6 

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:13.050
 and explain to you why first of all 

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:16.430
 of course it's practical for me 

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:18.660
 practicality is important in my here 

00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:21.480
 practicality of this rounded 

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:23.489
 the screen it is low that is 

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:27.870
 additional functionality here 

00:02:23.489 --> 00:02:30.840
 additional menus that s6 gives 

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:33.150
 edge they are not so much like that 

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:35.970
 straight special advantage to take 

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:38.010
 rounded screen and even like 

00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:39.630
 when you hold the device then more 

00:02:38.010 --> 00:02:43.290
 more comfortable to keep all the same 

00:02:39.630 --> 00:02:46.590
 galaxy s 6 on s6 edge so I 

00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:50.489
 Immediately running ahead but I will tell you 

00:02:46.590 --> 00:02:53.459
 what's interesting on the device and what it is 

00:02:50.489 --> 00:02:55.769
 you will have something special that is and i don't 

00:02:53.459 --> 00:02:57.840
 I think that many will want to buy this 

00:02:55.769 --> 00:02:59.610
 the device is well straight 

00:02:57.840 --> 00:03:02.130
 many many as you know how to buy 

00:02:59.610 --> 00:03:04.410
 iphone and yes then there is still 

00:03:02.130 --> 00:03:07.260
 eyeing though of course but that 

00:03:04.410 --> 00:03:10.230
 did his job he can say 

00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:14.100
 introduced the user to the curved 

00:03:10.230 --> 00:03:16.109
 displays that's basically people in 

00:03:14.100 --> 00:03:19.829
 a certain sense about hawal as far as 

00:03:16.109 --> 00:03:20.549
 I remember that about a million were sold. 

00:03:19.829 --> 00:03:24.150
 Total 

00:03:20.549 --> 00:03:27.600
 no agee around the world for this period 

00:03:24.150 --> 00:03:31.319
 how much is available and I think that 

00:03:27.600 --> 00:03:35.069
 galaxy s6 edge waiting for success at least five 

00:03:31.319 --> 00:03:36.810
 millions of devices sold for 2015 

00:03:35.069 --> 00:03:39.780
 year I think 5 million will be 

00:03:36.810 --> 00:03:43.950
 sold galaxy s6 will be at a minimum 

00:03:39.780 --> 00:03:48.750
 sold 10 million cat and even 15 even 

00:03:43.950 --> 00:03:50.609
 up to 20 million 2015 he of course 

00:03:48.750 --> 00:03:53.310
 Some cheaper for some people 

00:03:50.609 --> 00:03:56.420
 even the price factor will influence to 

00:03:53.310 --> 00:03:59.639
 example for the price of galaxy s6 

00:03:56.420 --> 00:04:02.849
 64gb i.e. it is exactly the same price as 

00:03:59.639 --> 00:04:05.130
 and galaxy s6 edge 32 GB subject to 

00:04:02.849 --> 00:04:09.299
 that memory expansion cards are not here 

00:04:05.130 --> 00:04:11.730
 accordingly and would be preferable 

00:04:09.299 --> 00:04:14.580
 for example take with more memory and a 

00:04:11.730 --> 00:04:17.400
 some people this time names like 

00:04:14.580 --> 00:04:18.239
 Well, I think that will be of concern and 

00:04:17.400 --> 00:04:21.330
 to interest 

00:04:18.239 --> 00:04:23.610
 I also want to say that for example in 

00:04:21.330 --> 00:04:26.490
 use is not always convenient 

00:04:23.610 --> 00:04:29.010
 use galaxy s6 edge because 

00:04:26.490 --> 00:04:32.340
 example in the same games where she is 

00:04:29.010 --> 00:04:33.690
 there is a part of a rounded tap not 

00:04:32.340 --> 00:04:36.000
 always comfortable to press 

00:04:33.690 --> 00:04:40.440
 you can look there immortals or 

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:42.120
 blitz where i played there well how would 

00:04:40.440 --> 00:04:45.030
 felt like a little discomfort 

00:04:42.120 --> 00:04:47.880
 and because of that i am i not exactly 

00:04:45.030 --> 00:04:51.120
 play comfortably so play games in 

00:04:47.880 --> 00:04:53.160
 traditional screen is also more convenient which 

00:04:51.120 --> 00:04:58.190
 advantage gives s6 edge 

00:04:53.160 --> 00:05:01.080
 He gives such as a new device and 

00:04:58.190 --> 00:05:04.020
 little functional, nothing more to 

00:05:01.080 --> 00:05:07.200
 Unfortunately, he doesn’t give me well 

00:05:04.020 --> 00:05:11.880
 of course still gives another minus is 

00:05:07.200 --> 00:05:14.070
 risk of breaking glass is easier on 

00:05:11.880 --> 00:05:16.170
 s6 edge it is less protected therefore 

00:05:14.070 --> 00:05:18.660
 surely if you take from 6 

00:05:16.170 --> 00:05:19.560
 years that I recommend looking at 

00:05:18.660 --> 00:05:22.560
 case 

00:05:19.560 --> 00:05:26.580
 and accordingly, well, although it is also 

00:05:22.560 --> 00:05:28.770
 It is necessary to cover it and yes such 

00:05:26.580 --> 00:05:31.710
 Here are the moments of comparisons, that is, I 

00:05:28.770 --> 00:05:32.820
 I choose all the same despite the coolness 

00:05:31.710 --> 00:05:34.919
 futuristic 

00:05:32.820 --> 00:05:37.950
 features all the other things like chips 

00:05:34.919 --> 00:05:40.919
 buns i still choose galaxy s6 

00:05:37.950 --> 00:05:42.780
 they are edge because he seems to be more 

00:05:40.919 --> 00:05:46.320
 practical as for me, plus everything is 

00:05:42.780 --> 00:05:48.510
 Version on how much I remember on 2 sim 

00:05:46.320 --> 00:05:49.770
 cards well there are six that should be too 

00:05:48.510 --> 00:05:53.190
 version for 2 sim cards 

00:05:49.770 --> 00:05:56.550
 but as if this is also such a conditional moment 

00:05:53.190 --> 00:05:59.040
 but the moment is precisely in practicality 

00:05:56.550 --> 00:05:59.760
 I’m more practical, like 

00:05:59.040 --> 00:06:01.650
 to this business 

00:05:59.760 --> 00:06:02.880
 plus the whole camera is the same 

00:06:01.650 --> 00:06:06.510
 same processor 

00:06:02.880 --> 00:06:08.340
 all principle is the same here that is 

00:06:06.510 --> 00:06:10.560
 soft nothing straight 

00:06:08.340 --> 00:06:14.310
 supernatural on top of special s6 

00:06:10.560 --> 00:06:16.860
 edge does not give and therefore I like him 

00:06:14.310 --> 00:06:18.729
 Of course everything looks cool but I 

00:06:16.860 --> 00:06:21.699
 somehow I do not know 

00:06:18.729 --> 00:06:24.120
 don't lean towards it 

00:06:21.699 --> 00:06:26.889
 they are the same size 

00:06:24.120 --> 00:06:30.569
 well can be from 6 to the floor literally 

00:06:26.889 --> 00:06:34.059
 millimeter you see above 

00:06:30.569 --> 00:06:37.389
 thinner then it seems they are the same yes 

00:06:34.059 --> 00:06:38.979
 by these parameters they are the same yes 

00:06:37.389 --> 00:06:41.469
 for all the rest, too, as if in principle 

00:06:38.979 --> 00:06:43.539
 they are the same here is my small 

00:06:41.469 --> 00:06:47.259
 reasoning on this topic 

00:06:43.539 --> 00:06:49.029
 what do you think about this clapping 

00:06:47.259 --> 00:06:51.279
 whether you are in a store or you maybe you 

00:06:49.029 --> 00:06:51.909
 own one and already from 

00:06:51.279 --> 00:06:55.389
 gadgets 

00:06:51.909 --> 00:06:58.419
 can share in the comments say 

00:06:55.389 --> 00:07:00.219
 what do you think and what device are you 

00:06:58.419 --> 00:07:05.710
 choose that is, by the way, there is a description 

00:07:00.219 --> 00:07:08.499
 link to the survey in contact and there is not 

00:07:05.710 --> 00:07:11.199
 forget to click what device you are 

00:07:08.499 --> 00:07:14.199
 choose galaxy s6 edge which left 

00:07:11.199 --> 00:07:16.330
 or galaxy s6 normal which on the right 

00:07:14.199 --> 00:07:18.580
 friends on this i will finish my 

00:07:16.330 --> 00:07:20.949
 video do not forget to like and 

00:07:18.580 --> 00:07:23.409
 subscribe to the channel watch reviews 

00:07:20.949 --> 00:07:25.689
 these devices watch tests and where 

00:07:23.409 --> 00:07:27.569
 watch camera tests what do I have 

00:07:25.689 --> 00:07:31.599
 still additionally on the channel therefore 

00:07:27.569 --> 00:07:33.580
 Come see and be aware 

00:07:31.599 --> 00:07:35.649
 be in the subject and 

00:07:33.580 --> 00:07:38.770
 as they say, know all everything all 

00:07:35.649 --> 00:07:40.449
 features and nuances of these devices and of 

00:07:38.770 --> 00:07:43.479
 in komenty write what device you 

00:07:40.449 --> 00:07:47.310
 Of course, you choose all your friends to all 

00:07:43.479 --> 00:07:47.310
 see you soon in new videos
