in a plastic packs um you're basically

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:37.209 
in a plastic packs um you're basically
just<00:00:34.950> simple<00:00:35.460> barrels<00:00:35.760> they<00:00:36.090> are<00:00:36.239> hollow

00:00:37.209 --> 00:00:37.219

bought 2 packs so I have 12 5-12 um they

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:03.680 
bought 2 packs so I have 12 5-12 um they
could<00:01:01.649> have<00:01:01.770> put<00:01:02.039> the<00:01:02.160> handle<00:01:02.579> on<00:01:02.609> the<00:01:02.820> job<00:01:03.059> and

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:03.690 
could have put the handle on the job and

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:05.690 
could have put the handle on the job and
they<00:01:04.559> got<00:01:04.710> to<00:01:04.830> put<00:01:04.979> like<00:01:05.159> a<00:01:05.189> base<00:01:05.430> on<00:01:05.670> the

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:05.700 
they got to put like a base on the

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:07.310 
they got to put like a base on the
bottom<00:01:06.090> you<00:01:06.240> can<00:01:06.330> see<00:01:06.659> there's<00:01:06.900> the<00:01:07.110> black

bottom you can see there's the black

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:10.370 
bottom you can see there's the black
line<00:01:07.640> to<00:01:08.640> simulate<00:01:08.909> like<00:01:09.420> a<00:01:09.450> little<00:01:09.810> base<00:01:09.990> but

00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:10.380 
line to simulate like a little base but

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:12.350 
line to simulate like a little base but
there's<00:01:11.100> no<00:01:11.250> room<00:01:11.490> to<00:01:11.520> put<00:01:11.850> like<00:01:12.030> fake

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:12.360 
there's no room to put like fake

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:16.039 
there's no room to put like fake
sandbags<00:01:13.020> down<00:01:13.320> so<00:01:13.710> it<00:01:13.770> looks<00:01:14.210> real<00:01:15.210> so<00:01:15.750> it

00:01:16.039 --> 00:01:16.049 
sandbags down so it looks real so it

00:01:16.049 --> 00:01:17.990 
sandbags down so it looks real so it
doesn't<00:01:16.409> it<00:01:16.560> doesn't<00:01:16.950> look<00:01:17.100> as<00:01:17.310> realistic<00:01:17.640> as

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:18.000 
doesn't it doesn't look as realistic as

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:21.320 
doesn't it doesn't look as realistic as
I<00:01:18.030> could<00:01:18.650> the<00:01:19.650> construction<00:01:20.280> signs<00:01:20.549> also<00:01:20.820> 6

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:21.330 
I could the construction signs also 6

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:27.499 
I could the construction signs also 6
came<00:01:21.659> in<00:01:21.840> a<00:01:21.869> pack<00:01:22.170> on<00:01:22.470> 2<00:01:23.159> 3<00:01:23.610> 4<00:01:24.000> 5<00:01:24.540> 6<00:01:25.280> and<00:01:26.299> I<00:01:27.299> bought

2 packs as well on the barrels came in
plastic<00:01:30.780> bags<00:01:31.579> this<00:01:32.579> signs<00:01:34.790> hold<00:01:35.790> on

00:01:38.469 --> 00:01:38.479 

00:01:38.479 --> 00:01:42.200

signs six of them came in one of these

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:47.359 
signs six of them came in one of these
packs<00:01:42.540> line<00:01:42.899> of<00:01:43.369> signs<00:01:45.770> um<00:01:46.770> they're<00:01:47.340> just

00:01:47.359 --> 00:01:47.369 
packs line of signs um they're just

00:01:47.369 --> 00:01:50.090 
packs line of signs um they're just
modern-day<00:01:48.060> construction<00:01:48.659> sides<00:01:48.930> I<00:01:49.259> would

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:50.100 
modern-day construction sides I would

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:53.929 
modern-day construction sides I would
barrels<00:01:50.670> or<00:01:50.909> modern<00:01:51.770> obviously<00:01:52.770> as<00:01:52.920> well<00:01:53.189> um

00:01:53.929 --> 00:01:53.939 
barrels or modern obviously as well um

00:01:53.939 --> 00:01:56.660 
barrels or modern obviously as well um
so<00:01:54.869> what<00:01:55.140> they<00:01:55.290> are<00:01:55.320> basically<00:01:55.860> is<00:01:56.159> well

00:01:56.660 --> 00:01:56.670 
so what they are basically is well

00:01:56.670 --> 00:01:58.880 
so what they are basically is well
there's<00:01:57.210> the<00:01:57.420> back<00:01:57.630> and<00:01:57.930> say<00:01:58.079> L<00:01:58.259> they<00:01:58.710> have

00:01:58.880 --> 00:01:58.890 
there's the back and say L they have

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:01.609 
there's the back and say L they have
like<00:01:59.159> that<00:01:59.659> piece<00:02:00.659> on<00:02:00.869> the<00:02:00.990> back<00:02:01.170> where<00:02:01.439> you

00:02:01.609 --> 00:02:01.619 
like that piece on the back where you

00:02:01.619 --> 00:02:02.850 
like that piece on the back where you
would<00:02:01.770> put<00:02:01.920> the<00:02:01.979> sandbag

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:02.860 
would put the sandbag

00:02:02.860 --> 00:02:05.640 
would put the sandbag
to<00:02:03.340> hold<00:02:03.550> it<00:02:03.760> down<00:02:03.940> and<00:02:04.240> the<00:02:04.870> two<00:02:05.050> on<00:02:05.230> the<00:02:05.260> front

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:05.650 
to hold it down and the two on the front

00:02:05.650 --> 00:02:09.180 
to hold it down and the two on the front
there<00:02:06.330> that<00:02:07.330> is<00:02:07.630> assigned<00:02:08.470> to<00:02:08.619> say<00:02:08.830> the<00:02:08.979> left

00:02:09.180 --> 00:02:09.190 
there that is assigned to say the left

00:02:09.190 --> 00:02:14.760 
there that is assigned to say the left
lane<00:02:09.520> is<00:02:09.550> closing<00:02:13.080> construction<00:02:14.080> next<00:02:14.320> 12

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:14.770

zone<00:02:41.140> ends<00:02:43.440> hard<00:02:44.440> to<00:02:44.620> stay<00:02:44.890> find<00:02:45.190> out<00:02:45.370> that<00:02:45.580> you

00:02:46.410 --> 00:02:46.420 
zone ends hard to stay find out that you

00:02:46.420 --> 00:02:49.620 
zone ends hard to stay find out that you
get<00:02:46.569> the<00:02:46.750> gist<00:02:46.989> of<00:02:47.170> it<00:02:47.760> so<00:02:48.760> that's<00:02:48.940> my<00:02:49.150> Iowa

00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:49.630 
get the gist of it so that's my Iowa

00:02:49.630 --> 00:02:53.370 
get the gist of it so that's my Iowa
barrels<00:02:50.110> and<00:02:50.410> the<00:02:50.700> signs<00:02:51.750> of<00:02:52.750> course<00:02:52.959> I've<00:02:53.200> G

00:02:53.370 --> 00:02:53.380 
barrels and the signs of course I've G

00:02:53.380 --> 00:02:55.170 
barrels and the signs of course I've G
said<00:02:53.590> there's<00:02:53.920> one<00:02:54.190> thing<00:02:54.430> they<00:02:54.819> could<00:02:55.060> have

00:02:55.170 --> 00:02:55.180 
said there's one thing they could have

00:02:55.180 --> 00:02:58.770 
said there's one thing they could have
done<00:02:55.330> though<00:02:55.540> is<00:02:55.569> made<00:02:56.050> a<00:02:56.819> left<00:02:57.819> lane<00:02:58.090> closed

00:02:58.770 --> 00:02:58.780 
done though is made a left lane closed

00:02:58.780 --> 00:03:00.479 
done though is made a left lane closed
