00:02:22.660 --> 00:02:22.670 
internal storage so we're looking at her

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:24.690 
internal storage so we're looking at her
I<00:02:22.910> would<00:02:23.270> say<00:02:23.420> like<00:02:23.540> a<00:02:23.600> low<00:02:23.840> entry<00:02:24.230> phone

00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:24.700 
I would say like a low entry phone

00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:27.400 
I would say like a low entry phone
compared<00:02:25.700> to<00:02:26.150> a<00:02:26.390> high-end<00:02:26.660> phone<00:02:27.170> and<00:02:27.350> in

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:27.410 
compared to a high-end phone and in

00:02:27.410 --> 00:02:29.410 
compared to a high-end phone and in
terms<00:02:27.590> of<00:02:27.740> pricing<00:02:28.310> I<00:02:28.460> would<00:02:28.850> guess<00:02:29.030> that<00:02:29.060> this

00:02:29.410 --> 00:02:29.420 
terms of pricing I would guess that this

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:32.500 
terms of pricing I would guess that this
will<00:02:29.660> cost<00:02:30.110> a<00:02:30.350> third<00:02:30.590> of<00:02:30.770> the<00:02:31.010> HSC<00:02:31.490> butterfly<00:02:32.330> s

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:32.510 
will cost a third of the HSC butterfly s

00:02:32.510 --> 00:02:34.420 
will cost a third of the HSC butterfly s
so<00:02:32.810> this<00:02:32.840> is<00:02:33.080> a<00:02:33.140> quick<00:02:33.290> and<00:02:33.350> dirty<00:02:33.560> look<00:02:33.830> of<00:02:34.190> the

00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:34.430 
so this is a quick and dirty look of the

00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:39.130 
so this is a quick and dirty look of the
HTC<00:02:35.590> desire<00:02:36.590> 700<00:02:37.120> compared<00:02:38.120> to<00:02:38.510> the<00:02:38.660> HSC
