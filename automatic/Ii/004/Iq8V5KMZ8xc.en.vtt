00:00:04.529 --> 00:00:10.150
 Hello everyone and today I will tell you about 

00:00:07.779 --> 00:00:13.139
 small diseases that appear 

00:00:10.150 --> 00:00:16.000
 have an orchid and how to deal with them 

00:00:13.139 --> 00:00:20.050
 I learned this option quite recently and 

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:22.060
 the fact is that yesterday I noticed that 

00:00:20.050 --> 00:00:22.740
 I had this beautiful achirin 

00:00:22.060 --> 00:00:25.869
 speck 

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:29.859
 she may well be from the sun 

00:00:25.869 --> 00:00:32.800
 but since it does not look dry, but 

00:00:29.859 --> 00:00:35.380
 how lined you are i don't want 

00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:39.330
 take a chance and spend a little cry 

00:00:35.380 --> 00:00:41.590
 heals in the same way as people 

00:00:39.330 --> 00:00:44.290
 some kind of bacterium or century appears 

00:00:41.590 --> 00:00:47.260
 I dare you do you use 

00:00:44.290 --> 00:00:49.300
 antibiotics and today I will 

00:00:47.260 --> 00:00:51.160
 use here such a triple 

00:00:49.300 --> 00:00:54.040
 antibiotic is just an ordinary cream or 

00:00:51.160 --> 00:00:55.870
 You can buy at any pharmacy and in 

00:00:54.040 --> 00:00:57.520
 principle even if you don't have cream and 

00:00:55.870 --> 00:01:00.630
 then you can absolutely use 

00:00:57.520 --> 00:01:03.700
 any flower even penicillin you just 

00:01:00.630 --> 00:01:06.520
 need to crush one tablet into powder 

00:01:03.700 --> 00:01:08.560
 and give as a few drops of water and you 

00:01:06.520 --> 00:01:10.870
 such pasta will turn out and we just 

00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:14.590
 put it all on the surface 

00:01:10.870 --> 00:01:17.110
 orchids and so is being applied 

00:01:14.590 --> 00:01:19.480
 need from one side of the sheet from the other 

00:01:17.110 --> 00:01:21.570
 now and now i will show you how i am 

00:01:19.480 --> 00:01:24.070
 I just take 

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:28.320
 squeeze the cream on antibiotics 

00:01:24.070 --> 00:01:31.750
 leaf and well and like that smear 

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:35.620
 if it is some kind of disease or 

00:01:31.750 --> 00:01:37.810
 the virus will disappear literally through 

00:01:35.620 --> 00:01:40.409
 a few days and will not go on because 

00:01:37.810 --> 00:01:43.390
 that the whole antibiotic is absorbed from the point and 

00:01:40.409 --> 00:01:45.790
 it will be enough and when you 

00:01:43.390 --> 00:01:48.940
 can try to anoint a little 

00:01:45.790 --> 00:01:54.870
 area slightly larger than this spot on 

00:01:48.940 --> 00:01:54.870
 just in case it was already reliable 

00:01:56.930 --> 00:02:01.810
 and exactly the same from the back and 

00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:11.660
 natural this orchid will need 

00:02:10.850 --> 00:02:13.970
 leave 

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:16.940
 from the rest of the orchids and hold in 

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:19.010
 Quarantine for about a month I hope you 

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:21.560
 pleasant hope my information was 

00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:24.130
 helpful wish you all a good mood and 

00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:24.130
 see you soon
