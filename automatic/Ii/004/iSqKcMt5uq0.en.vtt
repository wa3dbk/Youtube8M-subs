00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:35.150 
then enjoy but make sure you're spending
less<00:01:33.690> and<00:01:33.720> less<00:01:33.900> time<00:01:33.990> searching<00:01:34.470> and<00:01:34.979> more

00:01:35.150 --> 00:01:35.160 
less and less time searching and more

00:01:35.160 --> 00:01:40.800 
less and less time searching and more
and<00:01:35.490> more<00:01:35.640> time<00:01:35.880> enjoying<00:01:36.090> it

00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:40.810 

00:01:40.810 --> 00:01:53.830 

ready

00:01:53.830 --> 00:01:53.840 

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:57.130 

but<00:01:54.380> I<00:01:54.680> get<00:01:54.890> to<00:01:54.920> just<00:01:55.280> see<00:01:55.520> how<00:01:56.299> willing<00:01:56.869> is<00:01:56.990> he

00:01:57.130 --> 00:01:57.140 
but I get to just see how willing is he

00:01:57.140 --> 00:01:59.550 
but I get to just see how willing is he
to<00:01:57.290> put<00:01:57.439> in<00:01:57.560> his<00:01:57.710> responsibilities<00:01:58.670> do<00:01:59.000> his

00:01:59.550 --> 00:01:59.560 
to put in his responsibilities do his

00:01:59.560 --> 00:02:05.590 
to put in his responsibilities do his
circles<00:02:00.560> not<00:02:01.009> pulling<00:02:01.430> the<00:02:01.520> line<00:02:04.450> see<00:02:05.450> what

00:02:05.590 --> 00:02:05.600 
circles not pulling the line see what

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:09.960 
circles not pulling the line see what
he's<00:02:05.689> thinking

00:02:09.960 --> 00:02:09.970 

00:02:09.970 --> 00:02:16.580 

nice<00:02:10.970> good<00:02:11.420> boy

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:16.590 

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:18.990 

if<00:02:17.590> I'm<00:02:17.769> gonna<00:02:17.920> start<00:02:18.189> doing<00:02:18.370> basic<00:02:18.819> alignment

00:02:18.990 --> 00:02:19.000 
if I'm gonna start doing basic alignment

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:21.300 
if I'm gonna start doing basic alignment
exercise<00:02:19.659> means<00:02:20.500> I'm<00:02:20.650> gonna<00:02:20.739> have<00:02:20.829> to<00:02:21.010> be<00:02:21.219> able

00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:21.310 
exercise means I'm gonna have to be able

00:02:21.310 --> 00:02:33.410 
exercise means I'm gonna have to be able
to<00:02:21.459> influence<00:02:21.760> him<00:02:22.769> laterally

00:02:33.410 --> 00:02:33.420 

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:37.040 

so<00:02:34.420> I'll<00:02:34.510> just<00:02:34.660> do<00:02:34.810> a<00:02:34.840> little<00:02:35.020> track<00:02:35.470> like<00:02:36.010> how

00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:37.050 
so I'll just do a little track like how

00:02:37.050 --> 00:02:40.080 
so I'll just do a little track like how
much<00:02:38.050> is<00:02:38.260> he<00:02:38.440> reading<00:02:38.830> my<00:02:38.980> body<00:02:39.220> language<00:02:39.490> for

00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:40.090 
much is he reading my body language for

00:02:40.090 --> 00:02:43.320 
much is he reading my body language for
yields<00:02:40.950> if<00:02:41.950> I<00:02:42.130> point<00:02:42.400> at<00:02:42.610> the<00:02:42.700> hindquarters

00:02:43.320 --> 00:02:43.330 
yields if I point at the hindquarters

00:02:43.330 --> 00:02:45.060 
yields if I point at the hindquarters
does<00:02:43.540> he<00:02:43.660> bring<00:02:43.840> them<00:02:44.020> around<00:02:44.170> if<00:02:44.560> I<00:02:44.680> bring<00:02:44.920> my

00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:45.070 
does he bring them around if I bring my

00:02:45.070 --> 00:02:47.160 
does he bring them around if I bring my
gaze<00:02:45.310> more<00:02:45.610> to<00:02:45.730> the<00:02:45.910> middle<00:02:46.450> does<00:02:46.720> he<00:02:46.840> move<00:02:46.960> the

00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:47.170 
gaze more to the middle does he move the

00:02:47.170 --> 00:02:48.600 
gaze more to the middle does he move the
middle<00:02:47.440> if<00:02:47.560> I<00:02:47.650> bring<00:02:47.920> it<00:02:48.040> more<00:02:48.190> to<00:02:48.340> the<00:02:48.400> front

00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:48.610 
middle if I bring it more to the front

00:02:48.610 --> 00:02:50.430 
middle if I bring it more to the front
end<00:02:48.910> can<00:02:49.420> he<00:02:49.510> bring<00:02:49.690> the<00:02:49.840> front<00:02:50.110> end<00:02:50.260> around

00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:50.440 
end can he bring the front end around

00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:53.670 
end can he bring the front end around
you<00:02:51.220> know<00:02:51.310> and<00:02:51.430> how<00:02:51.670> at<00:02:52.390> your<00:02:52.690> fingertips<00:02:53.320> are

00:02:53.670 --> 00:02:53.680 
you know and how at your fingertips are

00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:56.880 
you know and how at your fingertips are
those<00:02:54.040> yields<00:02:54.690> that<00:02:55.690> felt<00:02:55.960> pretty<00:02:56.020> pretty

00:02:56.880 --> 00:02:56.890 
those yields that felt pretty pretty

00:02:56.890 --> 00:02:59.310 
those yields that felt pretty pretty
nice<00:02:57.160> but<00:02:57.880> just<00:02:57.910> the<00:02:58.270> suggestion<00:02:58.750> look<00:02:59.080> at<00:02:59.200> his

nice but just the suggestion look at his

00:02:59.320 --> 00:03:00.750 
nice but just the suggestion look at his
hindquarters<00:02:59.830> a<00:02:59.860> little<00:03:00.100> more<00:03:00.250> that's<00:03:00.460> nice

00:03:00.750 --> 00:03:00.760

00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:02.880 
hindquarters a little more that's nice
look<00:03:01.450> at<00:03:01.570> the<00:03:01.600> forehand<00:03:02.110> a<00:03:02.290> little<00:03:02.500> bit<00:03:02.650> more

00:03:02.880 --> 00:03:02.890 
look at the forehand a little bit more

00:03:02.890 --> 00:03:05.520 
look at the forehand a little bit more
can<00:03:03.130> the<00:03:03.250> forehand<00:03:03.760> go<00:03:04.030> out<00:03:04.240> now<00:03:05.020> back<00:03:05.290> to<00:03:05.320> the

00:03:05.520 --> 00:03:05.530 
can the forehand go out now back to the

00:03:05.530 --> 00:03:08.910 
can the forehand go out now back to the
hindquarters<00:03:06.130> now<00:03:06.400> energy<00:03:06.640> a<00:03:07.620> little<00:03:08.620> sticky

00:03:08.910 --> 00:03:08.920 
hindquarters now energy a little sticky

00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:12.630 
hindquarters now energy a little sticky
with<00:03:09.040> the<00:03:09.130> energy<00:03:09.430> after<00:03:09.700> that<00:03:09.850> so<00:03:11.130> yeah<00:03:12.130> let's

00:03:12.630 --> 00:03:12.640 
with the energy after that so yeah let's

00:03:12.640 --> 00:03:17.250 
with the energy after that so yeah let's
go<00:03:13.050> super<00:03:14.880> so<00:03:15.880> I'm<00:03:16.000> not<00:03:16.150> even<00:03:16.210> in<00:03:16.630> the<00:03:16.750> exercise

00:03:17.250 --> 00:03:17.260

go super so I'm not even in the exercise
yet<00:03:17.590> I'm<00:03:18.160> just<00:03:18.490> checking<00:03:21.000> maybe<00:03:22.000> back<00:03:22.270> to<00:03:22.300> a

00:03:22.470 --> 00:03:22.480 
yet I'm just checking maybe back to a

00:03:22.480 --> 00:03:24.960 
yet I'm just checking maybe back to a
regular<00:03:22.660> circle<00:03:23.110> game<00:03:23.500> for<00:03:24.190> a<00:03:24.250> moment<00:03:24.640> maybe<00:03:24.820> I

00:03:24.960 --> 00:03:24.970 
regular circle game for a moment maybe I

00:03:24.970 --> 00:03:27.930 
regular circle game for a moment maybe I
can<00:03:25.300> even<00:03:26.140> draw<00:03:26.470> the<00:03:26.530> hindquarters<00:03:27.310> close<00:03:27.610> to

00:03:27.930 --> 00:03:27.940 
can even draw the hindquarters close to

00:03:27.940 --> 00:03:30.510 
can even draw the hindquarters close to
me<00:03:28.090> bring<00:03:28.900> them<00:03:29.020> in<00:03:29.170> this<00:03:29.290> way<00:03:29.560> excellent<00:03:30.370> now

00:03:30.510 --> 00:03:30.520 
me bring them in this way excellent now

00:03:30.520 --> 00:03:33.360 
me bring them in this way excellent now
can<00:03:30.760> I<00:03:30.960> push<00:03:31.960> them<00:03:32.140> back<00:03:32.380> out<00:03:32.590> again<00:03:32.920> with<00:03:33.130> just

00:03:33.360 --> 00:03:33.370 
can I push them back out again with just

00:03:33.370 --> 00:03:38.640 
can I push them back out again with just
my<00:03:33.580> focus<00:03:34.200> so<00:03:35.340> good<00:03:36.340> job<00:03:36.520> atomic<00:03:37.500> so<00:03:38.500> I'm

00:03:38.640 --> 00:03:38.650 
my focus so good job atomic so I'm

00:03:38.650 --> 00:03:40.830 
my focus so good job atomic so I'm
getting<00:03:38.860> he's<00:03:39.130> really<00:03:39.730> quick<00:03:39.880> to<00:03:40.060> relax<00:03:40.450> so

00:03:40.830 --> 00:03:40.840 
getting he's really quick to relax so

00:03:40.840 --> 00:03:42.180 
getting he's really quick to relax so
even<00:03:41.110> though<00:03:41.200> things<00:03:41.530> get<00:03:41.740> a<00:03:41.770> little<00:03:41.950> intense

00:03:42.180 --> 00:03:42.190 
even though things get a little intense

00:03:42.190 --> 00:03:44.010 
even though things get a little intense
you<00:03:42.430> can<00:03:42.490> relax<00:03:42.760> no<00:03:43.030> like<00:03:43.180> all<00:03:43.390> right<00:03:43.480> I'm

00:03:44.010 --> 00:03:44.020 
you can relax no like all right I'm

00:03:44.020 --> 00:03:47.190 
you can relax no like all right I'm
pretty<00:03:44.290> sure<00:03:44.590> I<00:03:44.620> have<00:03:44.950> some<00:03:45.220> pieces<00:03:45.430> here<00:03:46.200> now

00:03:47.190 --> 00:03:47.200 
pretty sure I have some pieces here now

00:03:47.200 --> 00:03:49.400 
pretty sure I have some pieces here now
let's<00:03:47.740> see<00:03:47.860> if<00:03:47.980> I<00:03:48.070> can<00:03:48.250> put<00:03:48.430> them<00:03:48.580> together<00:03:48.700> and

00:03:49.400 --> 00:03:49.410 
let's see if I can put them together and

00:03:49.410 --> 00:03:50.520 
let's see if I can put them together and
think

00:03:50.520 --> 00:03:50.530 
think

00:03:50.530 --> 00:03:54.120 
think
can<00:03:50.890> I<00:03:50.920> cause<00:03:51.340> him<00:03:51.790> to<00:03:52.510> quickly<00:03:52.900> find<00:03:53.680> a

00:03:54.120 --> 00:03:54.130 
can I cause him to quickly find a

00:03:54.130 --> 00:03:56.610 
can I cause him to quickly find a
balanced<00:03:54.910> place<00:03:55.420> where<00:03:55.750> he<00:03:55.990> feels<00:03:56.290> like

00:03:56.610 --> 00:03:56.620 
balanced place where he feels like

00:03:56.620 --> 00:04:01.190 
balanced place where he feels like
stretching

00:04:01.190 --> 00:04:01.200 

00:04:01.200 --> 00:04:04.860 

how<00:04:02.200> can<00:04:02.500> I<00:04:02.620> be<00:04:02.860> with<00:04:02.890> him<00:04:03.400> on<00:04:03.550> the<00:04:03.700> circle<00:04:04.120> so

00:04:04.860 --> 00:04:04.870 
how can I be with him on the circle so

00:04:04.870 --> 00:04:07.350 
how can I be with him on the circle so
that<00:04:05.020> we<00:04:05.110> cause<00:04:05.290> a<00:04:05.320> stretch<00:04:05.970> when<00:04:06.970> I<00:04:07.000> start

00:04:07.350 --> 00:04:07.360 
that we cause a stretch when I start

00:04:07.360 --> 00:04:10.050 
that we cause a stretch when I start
doing<00:04:07.510> that<00:04:07.870> I'm<00:04:08.410> gonna<00:04:09.040> start<00:04:09.280> tracking<00:04:09.610> with

00:04:10.050 --> 00:04:10.060 
doing that I'm gonna start tracking with

00:04:10.060 --> 00:04:12.330 
doing that I'm gonna start tracking with
him<00:04:10.300> so<00:04:10.960> maybe<00:04:11.200> it's<00:04:11.470> no<00:04:11.620> longer<00:04:11.800> a<00:04:11.980> circle

00:04:12.330 --> 00:04:12.340 
him so maybe it's no longer a circle

00:04:12.340 --> 00:04:14.100 
him so maybe it's no longer a circle
game<00:04:12.490> maybe<00:04:12.820> it's<00:04:13.030> like<00:04:13.180> long-distance<00:04:13.420> stick

00:04:14.100 --> 00:04:14.110 
game maybe it's like long-distance stick

00:04:14.110 --> 00:04:16.800 
game maybe it's like long-distance stick
to<00:04:14.290> me<00:04:14.440> I<00:04:14.590> want<00:04:15.220> to<00:04:15.340> think<00:04:15.550> that<00:04:15.730> we<00:04:16.120> are<00:04:16.570> doing

00:04:16.800 --> 00:04:16.810 
to me I want to think that we are doing

00:04:16.810 --> 00:04:17.640 
to me I want to think that we are doing
this<00:04:17.049> together

00:04:17.640 --> 00:04:17.650 
this together

00:04:17.650 --> 00:04:20.190 
this together
I<00:04:17.680> want<00:04:18.250> my<00:04:18.459> posture<00:04:19.090> to<00:04:19.299> now<00:04:19.480> reflect<00:04:19.989> what

00:04:20.190 --> 00:04:20.200 
I want my posture to now reflect what

00:04:20.200 --> 00:04:21.780 
I want my posture to now reflect what
I'd<00:04:20.290> like<00:04:20.440> him<00:04:20.590> to<00:04:20.739> do<00:04:20.890> it's<00:04:21.280> no<00:04:21.520> longer

00:04:21.780 --> 00:04:21.790 
I'd like him to do it's no longer

00:04:21.790 --> 00:04:25.200 
I'd like him to do it's no longer
whatever<00:04:22.660> it's<00:04:23.430> something<00:04:24.430> and<00:04:24.610> that's

00:04:25.200 --> 00:04:25.210 
whatever it's something and that's

00:04:25.210 --> 00:04:27.600 
whatever it's something and that's
really<00:04:25.570> important<00:04:26.260> and<00:04:26.380> then<00:04:26.620> once<00:04:27.190> I<00:04:27.370> have

00:04:27.600 --> 00:04:27.610 
really important and then once I have

00:04:27.610 --> 00:04:30.210 
really important and then once I have
that<00:04:27.790> something<00:04:28.300> posture<00:04:28.810> that<00:04:29.020> in<00:04:29.140> mind<00:04:29.440> I'm

00:04:30.210 --> 00:04:30.220 
that something posture that in mind I'm

00:04:30.220 --> 00:04:32.670 
that something posture that in mind I'm
like<00:04:30.670> an<00:04:30.850> artist<00:04:31.300> mixing<00:04:31.960> the<00:04:32.080> colors<00:04:32.410> on<00:04:32.560> the

00:04:32.670 --> 00:04:32.680 
like an artist mixing the colors on the

00:04:32.680 --> 00:04:34.110 
like an artist mixing the colors on the
palette<00:04:33.070> trying<00:04:33.310> to<00:04:33.400> create<00:04:33.670> the<00:04:33.850> color<00:04:34.030> I

00:04:34.110 --> 00:04:34.120 
palette trying to create the color I

00:04:34.120 --> 00:04:36.510 
palette trying to create the color I
want<00:04:34.480> and<00:04:34.690> then<00:04:35.140> go<00:04:35.260> to<00:04:35.320> neutral<00:04:35.920> the<00:04:36.250> neutral

00:04:36.510 --> 00:04:36.520 
want and then go to neutral the neutral

00:04:36.520 --> 00:04:39.780 
want and then go to neutral the neutral
for<00:04:37.300> that<00:04:37.780> stretch<00:04:38.280> there<00:04:39.280> he<00:04:39.400> is<00:04:39.520> doing

00:04:39.780 --> 00:04:39.790 
for that stretch there he is doing

00:04:39.790 --> 00:04:43.380 
for that stretch there he is doing
whatever<00:04:40.300> kind<00:04:40.930> of<00:04:41.050> trot<00:04:41.320> he<00:04:41.530> would<00:04:41.710> like<00:04:42.390> and

00:04:43.380 --> 00:04:43.390 
whatever kind of trot he would like and

00:04:43.390 --> 00:04:48.930 
whatever kind of trot he would like and
we'll<00:04:43.750> call<00:04:43.960> this<00:04:44.110> a<00:04:44.170> circle<00:04:44.620> game<00:04:47.640> now<00:04:48.640> I'm

00:04:48.930 --> 00:04:48.940 
we'll call this a circle game now I'm

00:04:48.940 --> 00:04:50.610 
we'll call this a circle game now I'm
gonna<00:04:49.060> start<00:04:49.330> picturing<00:04:49.660> him<00:04:50.170> doing<00:04:50.500> an

00:04:50.610 --> 00:04:50.620 
gonna start picturing him doing an

00:04:50.620 --> 00:04:55.760 
gonna start picturing him doing an
energetic<00:04:51.510> stretch<00:04:53.280> he's<00:04:54.280> already<00:04:54.670> changing

00:04:55.760 --> 00:04:55.770 
energetic stretch he's already changing

00:04:55.770 --> 00:04:58.560 
energetic stretch he's already changing
he<00:04:56.770> feels<00:04:57.040> my<00:04:57.250> intention<00:04:57.730> I'm<00:04:57.820> pretty<00:04:58.060> neutral

00:04:58.560 --> 00:04:58.570 
he feels my intention I'm pretty neutral

00:04:58.570 --> 00:05:00.840 
he feels my intention I'm pretty neutral
and<00:04:59.230> I'm<00:04:59.440> gonna<00:04:59.560> make<00:04:59.770> a<00:04:59.830> little<00:05:00.070> suggestion

00:05:00.840 --> 00:05:00.850 
and I'm gonna make a little suggestion

00:05:00.850 --> 00:05:02.520 
and I'm gonna make a little suggestion
he<00:05:01.000> likes<00:05:01.210> to<00:05:01.360> carry<00:05:01.600> his<00:05:01.720> haunches<00:05:01.930> sometimes

00:05:02.520 --> 00:05:02.530 
he likes to carry his haunches sometimes

00:05:02.530 --> 00:05:04.740 
he likes to carry his haunches sometimes
in<00:05:02.770> on<00:05:02.920> this<00:05:03.070> side<00:05:03.310> and<00:05:04.060> he<00:05:04.300> gets<00:05:04.480> a<00:05:04.600> little

00:05:04.740 --> 00:05:04.750 
in on this side and he gets a little

00:05:04.750 --> 00:05:06.450 
in on this side and he gets a little
slow<00:05:05.050> so<00:05:05.350> I'm<00:05:05.470> making<00:05:05.650> some<00:05:05.830> suggestions

00:05:06.450 --> 00:05:06.460 
slow so I'm making some suggestions

00:05:06.460 --> 00:05:09.120 
slow so I'm making some suggestions
don't<00:05:07.420> pull<00:05:07.660> out<00:05:07.690> on<00:05:07.930> the<00:05:07.960> circle<00:05:08.470> maybe<00:05:09.010> a

00:05:09.120 --> 00:05:09.130 
don't pull out on the circle maybe a

00:05:09.130 --> 00:05:11.430 
don't pull out on the circle maybe a
little<00:05:09.340> over<00:05:09.490> there<00:05:09.700> like<00:05:10.510> in<00:05:10.660> tiny<00:05:11.020> little

00:05:11.430 --> 00:05:11.440 
little over there like in tiny little

00:05:11.440 --> 00:05:16.680 
little over there like in tiny little
yields<00:05:12.010> I<00:05:12.130> feel<00:05:12.580> them<00:05:13.000> working<00:05:13.980> super<00:05:15.510> and<00:05:16.510> now

00:05:16.680 --> 00:05:16.690 
yields I feel them working super and now

00:05:16.690 --> 00:05:18.510 
yields I feel them working super and now
he's<00:05:17.020> in<00:05:17.170> it<00:05:17.200> so<00:05:17.530> I'm<00:05:17.680> gonna<00:05:17.770> go<00:05:18.010> to<00:05:18.070> a<00:05:18.190> neutral

00:05:18.510 --> 00:05:18.520 
he's in it so I'm gonna go to a neutral

00:05:18.520 --> 00:05:21.750 
he's in it so I'm gonna go to a neutral
I<00:05:19.000> still<00:05:19.840> have<00:05:20.020> the<00:05:20.170> intention<00:05:20.800> he<00:05:21.310> still<00:05:21.580> it's

00:05:21.750 --> 00:05:21.760 
I still have the intention he still it's

00:05:21.760 --> 00:05:24.630 
I still have the intention he still it's
not<00:05:21.910> whatever<00:05:22.320> but<00:05:23.320> now<00:05:23.440> I'm<00:05:23.590> not<00:05:23.890> staring<00:05:24.460> at

00:05:24.630 --> 00:05:24.640 
not whatever but now I'm not staring at

00:05:24.640 --> 00:05:26.580 
not whatever but now I'm not staring at
him<00:05:24.790> I'm<00:05:24.940> relaxed<00:05:25.540> in<00:05:25.690> my<00:05:25.720> hand<00:05:26.140> holding<00:05:26.530> the

00:05:28.390 --> 00:05:31.890 
whip I'm relaxed in my hand holding the
line<00:05:28.690> I'm<00:05:29.530> feeling<00:05:30.220> like<00:05:30.430> he's<00:05:31.060> on<00:05:31.270> a<00:05:31.300> circle

00:05:31.890 --> 00:05:31.900 
line I'm feeling like he's on a circle

00:05:31.900 --> 00:05:35.340 
line I'm feeling like he's on a circle
and<00:05:32.200> I'm<00:05:32.680> following<00:05:33.010> him<00:05:33.780> he's<00:05:34.780> in<00:05:34.960> front<00:05:35.230> of

00:05:35.340 --> 00:05:35.350 
and I'm following him he's in front of

00:05:35.350 --> 00:05:35.610 
and I'm following him he's in front of
me

00:05:35.610 --> 00:05:35.620 
me

00:05:35.620 --> 00:05:38.100 
me
a<00:05:35.860> little<00:05:36.280> bit<00:05:36.460> not<00:05:37.000> because<00:05:37.390> I'm<00:05:37.540> chasing<00:05:38.080> him

00:05:38.100 --> 00:05:38.110 
a little bit not because I'm chasing him

00:05:38.110 --> 00:05:40.650 
a little bit not because I'm chasing him
but<00:05:38.560> because<00:05:38.740> I'm<00:05:39.220> letting<00:05:39.490> him<00:05:39.760> go<00:05:39.970> first<00:05:40.240> in

00:05:40.650 --> 00:05:40.660 
but because I'm letting him go first in

00:05:40.660 --> 00:05:47.850 
but because I'm letting him go first in
front<00:05:41.320> of<00:05:41.470> the<00:05:41.620> leg<00:05:42.180> that's<00:05:43.180> super<00:05:43.780> good<00:05:46.860> and

00:05:47.850 --> 00:05:47.860 
front of the leg that's super good and

00:05:47.860 --> 00:05:57.320 
front of the leg that's super good and
game<00:05:48.730> over<00:05:49.410> super<00:05:50.640> that's<00:05:51.640> awesome<00:05:52.210> good<00:05:52.390> boy

00:05:57.320 --> 00:05:57.330 

00:05:57.330 --> 00:05:59.730 

we'll<00:05:58.330> see<00:05:58.480> if<00:05:58.600> I<00:05:58.690> can<00:05:58.870> recreate<00:05:59.260> this<00:05:59.500> because

00:05:59.730 --> 00:05:59.740 
we'll see if I can recreate this because

00:05:59.740 --> 00:06:02.580 
we'll see if I can recreate this because
he's<00:05:59.890> pretty<00:06:00.160> sensitive<00:06:00.670> but<00:06:01.110> it<00:06:02.110> starts<00:06:02.500> to

00:06:02.580 --> 00:06:02.590 
he's pretty sensitive but it starts to

00:06:02.590 --> 00:06:04.980 
he's pretty sensitive but it starts to
look<00:06:02.830> like<00:06:03.100> this<00:06:03.370> like<00:06:04.150> people<00:06:04.570> have<00:06:04.780> like<00:06:04.810> a

00:06:04.980 --> 00:06:04.990 
look like this like people have like a

00:06:04.990 --> 00:06:07.530 
look like this like people have like a
laser<00:06:05.350> beam<00:06:05.740> focus<00:06:06.010> and<00:06:06.580> they're<00:06:07.030> constantly

00:06:07.530 --> 00:06:07.540 
laser beam focus and they're constantly
