something<00:02:00.360> it's<00:02:00.810> just<00:02:01.020> taking<00:02:01.350> it<00:02:01.439> slow

00:02:01.460 --> 00:02:01.470 
something it's just taking it slow

00:02:01.470 --> 00:02:05.120

little<00:02:02.009> time<00:02:02.929> here<00:02:03.929> we<00:02:04.049> have<00:02:04.200> my<00:02:04.439> guanabana

00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:05.130 
little time here we have my guanabana

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:11.390 
little time here we have my guanabana
seedlings<00:02:06.259> earlier<00:02:07.259> I<00:02:07.380> had<00:02:07.679> them<00:02:08.009> in<00:02:08.250> the<00:02:10.400> red

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:11.400 
seedlings earlier I had them in the red

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:16.559 
seedlings earlier I had them in the red
clay<00:02:11.670> soil

00:02:16.559 --> 00:02:16.569 

00:02:16.569 --> 00:02:18.360 

I<00:02:16.749> wasn't<00:02:17.200> really<00:02:17.409> happy<00:02:17.769> with<00:02:17.799> that<00:02:18.099> so<00:02:18.340> I

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:18.370 
I wasn't really happy with that so I

00:02:18.370 --> 00:02:21.780 
I wasn't really happy with that so I
removed<00:02:18.909> them<00:02:19.090> from<00:02:19.150> there<00:02:19.689> and<00:02:20.609> finally<00:02:21.609> they

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:21.790 
removed them from there and finally they

00:02:21.790 --> 00:02:23.879 
removed them from there and finally they
are<00:02:21.819> germinating<00:02:22.510> this<00:02:23.290> one<00:02:23.530> here<00:02:23.739> on<00:02:23.859> the

00:02:23.879 --> 00:02:23.889 
are germinating this one here on the

00:02:23.889 --> 00:02:25.739 
are germinating this one here on the
right<00:02:24.040> is<00:02:24.459> really<00:02:24.999> kind<00:02:25.329> of<00:02:25.450> weird-looking

00:02:25.739 --> 00:02:25.749 
right is really kind of weird-looking

00:02:25.749 --> 00:02:29.129 
right is really kind of weird-looking
way-it's<00:02:26.409> swooped<00:02:27.280> down<00:02:27.370> like<00:02:27.760> that<00:02:28.030> but<00:02:28.359> I'm

00:02:29.129 --> 00:02:29.139 
way-it's swooped down like that but I'm

00:02:29.139 --> 00:02:30.989 
way-it's swooped down like that but I'm
sure<00:02:29.230> we<00:02:29.590> can<00:02:29.709> get<00:02:29.859> that<00:02:30.010> taken<00:02:30.219> care<00:02:30.400> of<00:02:30.639> so

00:02:30.989 --> 00:02:30.999 
sure we can get that taken care of so

00:02:30.999 --> 00:02:33.899 
sure we can get that taken care of so
yeah<00:02:31.260> these<00:02:32.260> are<00:02:32.499> growing<00:02:32.950> pretty<00:02:33.099> well<00:02:33.280> as<00:02:33.700> at

00:02:33.899 --> 00:02:33.909 
yeah these are growing pretty well as at

00:02:33.909 --> 00:02:45.360 
yeah these are growing pretty well as at
the<00:02:34.150> moment<00:02:34.540> as<00:02:34.629> well<00:02:43.919> here<00:02:44.919> we<00:02:45.010> have<00:02:45.040> the

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:45.370 
the moment as well here we have the

00:02:45.370 --> 00:02:49.229 
the moment as well here we have the
miracle<00:02:45.909> fruit<00:02:46.209> or<00:02:46.540> miracle<00:02:47.079> berry<00:02:48.060> may<00:02:49.060> be<00:02:49.120> a

00:02:49.229 --> 00:02:49.239 
miracle fruit or miracle berry may be a

00:02:49.239 --> 00:02:51.360 
miracle fruit or miracle berry may be a
little<00:02:49.419> difficult<00:02:49.689> to<00:02:50.079> see<00:02:50.200> it's<00:02:50.859> right<00:02:51.099> there

00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:51.370 
little difficult to see it's right there

00:02:51.370 --> 00:02:55.080 
little difficult to see it's right there
in<00:02:51.489> the<00:02:51.519> middle<00:02:53.400> you<00:02:54.400> might<00:02:54.609> notice<00:02:54.939> a<00:02:55.060> little

00:02:55.080 --> 00:02:55.090 
in the middle you might notice a little

00:02:55.090 --> 00:02:58.129 
in the middle you might notice a little
kind<00:02:55.810> of<00:02:55.989> chute<00:02:56.560> sticking<00:02:57.129> up<00:02:57.280> out<00:02:57.489> of<00:02:57.519> it<00:02:57.849> I

00:02:58.129 --> 00:02:58.139 
kind of chute sticking up out of it I

00:02:58.139 --> 00:03:00.599 
kind of chute sticking up out of it I
think<00:02:59.139> that's<00:02:59.680> going<00:02:59.859> to<00:02:59.949> turn<00:03:00.159> into<00:03:00.219> the

00:03:00.599 --> 00:03:00.609 
think that's going to turn into the

00:03:00.609 --> 00:03:03.559 
think that's going to turn into the
plant<00:03:00.909> the<00:03:01.299> roots<00:03:01.540> going<00:03:01.959> down<00:03:02.169> into<00:03:02.439> the<00:03:02.560> soil

00:03:03.559 --> 00:03:03.569 
plant the roots going down into the soil

00:03:03.569 --> 00:03:06.119 
plant the roots going down into the soil

one is the only one that survived till

00:06:02.910 --> 00:06:06.020 
one is the only one that survived till
now<00:06:03.120> it's<00:06:03.420> been<00:06:03.600> about<00:06:03.630> two<00:06:04.080> weeks<00:06:04.370> I<00:06:05.370> do<00:06:05.700> think

00:06:06.020 --> 00:06:06.030 
now it's been about two weeks I do think

00:06:06.030 --> 00:06:06.950 
now it's been about two weeks I do think
this<00:06:06.150> one<00:06:06.330> is<00:06:06.420> probably<00:06:06.570> going<00:06:06.840> to<00:06:06.900> take

00:06:06.950 --> 00:06:06.960 
this one is probably going to take

00:06:06.960 --> 00:06:08.840 
this one is probably going to take
because<00:06:07.560> usually<00:06:07.740> after<00:06:08.160> a<00:06:08.340> couple<00:06:08.550> of<00:06:08.670> weeks

00:06:08.840 --> 00:06:08.850 
because usually after a couple of weeks

00:06:08.850 --> 00:06:13.040 
because usually after a couple of weeks
if<00:06:09.060> it<00:06:09.210> continues<00:06:09.840> to<00:06:09.870> grow<00:06:10.170> and<00:06:12.050> everything

00:06:13.040 --> 00:06:13.050 
if it continues to grow and everything

00:06:13.050 --> 00:06:16.820 
if it continues to grow and everything
then<00:06:13.920> it'll<00:06:14.310> take<00:06:14.810> for<00:06:15.810> anybody<00:06:16.140> wondering<00:06:16.680> if

00:06:16.820 --> 00:06:16.830 
then it'll take for anybody wondering if

00:06:16.830 --> 00:06:20.450 
then it'll take for anybody wondering if
