00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:28.470 
lot slower than bananas do so they will

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:31.279

really nice crispy plantain kind of

00:04:42.849 --> 00:04:47.670 
really nice crispy plantain kind of
chips<00:04:45.419> now<00:04:46.419> another<00:04:46.720> benefit<00:04:47.320> of<00:04:47.349> having

00:04:47.670 --> 00:04:47.680 
chips now another benefit of having

00:04:47.680 --> 00:04:50.249 
chips now another benefit of having
green<00:04:48.190> plantains<00:04:48.880> versus<00:04:49.509> the<00:04:49.660> yellow<00:04:49.930> ones

00:04:50.249 --> 00:04:50.259 
green plantains versus the yellow ones

00:04:50.259 --> 00:04:52.830 
green plantains versus the yellow ones
is<00:04:50.650> the<00:04:51.280> green<00:04:51.490> ones<00:04:51.699> have<00:04:51.880> substantially

00:04:52.830 --> 00:04:52.840 
is the green ones have substantially

00:04:52.840 --> 00:04:55.350 
is the green ones have substantially
less<00:04:53.139> sugar<00:04:53.770> in<00:04:54.070> them<00:04:54.340> so<00:04:54.669> they<00:04:54.820> fry<00:04:55.090> up<00:04:55.270> a

00:04:55.350 --> 00:04:55.360 
less sugar in them so they fry up a

00:04:55.360 --> 00:04:57.779 
less sugar in them so they fry up a
little<00:04:55.599> bit<00:04:55.750> crisper<00:04:56.320> and<00:04:56.590> you<00:04:57.220> don't<00:04:57.490> run<00:04:57.669> the

00:04:57.779 --> 00:04:57.789 
little bit crisper and you don't run the

00:04:57.789 --> 00:06:26.390 
little bit crisper and you don't run the
risk<00:04:58.000> of<00:04:58.210> that<00:04:58.360> sugar<00:04:58.659> burning

00:06:26.390 --> 00:06:26.400 

00:06:26.400 --> 00:06:29.400
