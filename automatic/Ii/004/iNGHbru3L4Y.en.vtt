00:00:00.319 --> 00:00:05.580
 hello dear friends here mind 

00:00:03.270 --> 00:00:10.710
 filming is another replenishment of my 

00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:14.990
 The collection is a knife which I ordered by 

00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:17.190
 according to your own design 

00:00:14.990 --> 00:00:20.779
 I would like to make a brief review 

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:28.920
 this knife means a wedge we go 

00:00:20.779 --> 00:00:29.460
 8 centimeters long means thickness in 

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:34.110
 butt 

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:40.050
 not starting to about 5 millimeters 

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:44.820
 and goes further to refinement also see 

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:48.270
 Well, there is a little edge of course 

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:51.059
 the cutting is allocated well, mostly from 

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:53.879
 grounds to the bottom almost almost 

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:54.600
 zero reduced husband that's what I would like 

00:00:53.879 --> 00:00:59.280
 still say 

00:00:54.600 --> 00:01:00.390
 This knife means the handle comes from 

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:06.270
 component parts 

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:10.439
 I did not make a stop and under the toes 

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:15.570
 have made textolite inserts 

00:01:10.439 --> 00:01:21.240
 orders from the front of the back handle 

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:24.210
 there is again birch sores that is 

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:27.920
 the so -called chaga are also two components 

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:33.780
 parts it was all connected 

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:37.170
 I called this knife Sagittarius that is to say 

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:42.470
 your zodiac sign is more or less so 

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:46.439
 I liked the name that's just been 

00:01:42.470 --> 00:01:50.040
 made the cover this time the cover was 

00:01:46.439 --> 00:01:52.619
 made of thin leather there inner 

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:56.450
 wood insert goes I do not know soon 

00:01:52.619 --> 00:02:01.159
 all and will not be seen from here and covered 

00:01:56.450 --> 00:02:03.990
 thin skin allowing our very 

00:02:01.159 --> 00:02:07.189
 sits tight in this case and he 

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:07.189
 keeps very well 

00:02:08.540 --> 00:02:18.960
 this knife i ordered for use so 

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:22.860
 let's say in the kitchen so that you can do 

00:02:18.960 --> 00:02:25.440
 meat or chicken let's cut there 

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:28.460
 some products are used purely in 

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:28.460
 home conditions 

00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:36.270
 I also managed to learn from the master 

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:40.050
 little did us more about this 

00:02:36.270 --> 00:02:44.640
 steel from what produces in past videos 

00:02:40.050 --> 00:02:47.100
 I said that steel was made from 

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:50.100
 steel which was mined for meat on 

00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:54.870
 Omsk meat processing plant that is to me 

00:02:50.100 --> 00:02:58.290
 told what this steel means 

00:02:54.870 --> 00:03:00.780
 material is used for cutting the meat 

00:02:58.290 --> 00:03:07.770
 There is in some knives there I already detail 

00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:12.180
 I do not know that was the same for me 

00:03:07.770 --> 00:03:15.450
 told what it means when he got this 

00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:18.440
 material he considered it means under 

00:03:15.450 --> 00:03:21.630
 magnifying somehow 

00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:26.550
 glass means either a microscope and 

00:03:21.630 --> 00:03:30.989
 also he will explain to me that this become something 

00:03:26.550 --> 00:03:35.489
 have she is wrought has somewhere 

00:03:30.989 --> 00:03:38.970
 roughly he says that about 60 70 

00:03:35.489 --> 00:03:44.190
 layers that is when cutting data 

00:03:38.970 --> 00:03:45.750
 Now these layers have become visible. again 

00:03:44.190 --> 00:03:48.900
 same goes under the blade 

00:03:45.750 --> 00:03:52.350
 that is, shave the hair on the arm and all 

00:03:48.900 --> 00:03:54.470
 Other, that is, I am also a little bit for myself. 

00:03:52.350 --> 00:03:58.110
 brought out 

00:03:54.470 --> 00:04:01.890
 new ways to prepare these blades 

00:03:58.110 --> 00:04:05.519
 given steel precisely if i have in 

00:04:01.890 --> 00:04:08.519
 collections of knives which are very 

00:04:05.519 --> 00:04:10.769
 quality steel made i mean i 

00:04:08.519 --> 00:04:13.290

00:04:13.290 --> 00:04:15.890

00:04:38.060 --> 00:04:45.320
