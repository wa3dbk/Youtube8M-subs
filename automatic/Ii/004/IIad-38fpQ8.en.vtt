not you know on on key but what you get
used<00:03:48.940> to<00:03:49.030> the<00:03:49.180> loadout<00:03:49.569> you<00:03:49.870> learn<00:03:50.080> how<00:03:50.319> to

00:03:50.570 --> 00:03:50.580 
used to the loadout you learn how to

00:03:50.580 --> 00:03:56.370 
used to the loadout you learn how to
rotate<00:03:51.810> you<00:03:52.810> know<00:03:53.940> make<00:03:54.940> the<00:03:54.970> load<00:03:55.299> outward<00:03:55.750> to

00:03:56.370 --> 00:03:56.380 
rotate you know make the load outward to

00:03:56.380 --> 00:03:59.330 
rotate you know make the load outward to
the<00:03:56.650> situation<00:03:57.310> that<00:03:57.430> you're<00:03:57.579> in<00:03:57.840> so<00:03:58.840> all
