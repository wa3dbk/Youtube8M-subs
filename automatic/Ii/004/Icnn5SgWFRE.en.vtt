 is olive oil and garlic 

00:02:20.530 --> 00:02:26.650
 or I'll start by putting my juice 

00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:28.989
 here for that amount of 

00:02:26.650 --> 00:02:31.510
 approximately two 

00:02:28.989 --> 00:02:34.350
 units of lemon will suffice is 

00:02:31.510 --> 00:02:34.350
 just the juice 

00:02:38.170 --> 00:02:44.390
 here the garlic is going to give a bit of 

00:02:41.450 --> 00:02:45.890

 properties a machismo car is 

00:02:58.450 --> 00:03:10.250

 Good. Let's go a little bit, except for a few. 

00:03:10.250 --> 00:03:16.570
 We can let the final acceptance 14 

00:03:19.970 --> 00:03:25.410
 the movement so we can use 

00:03:23.610 --> 00:03:28.350
 both that Syrian pepper powder 

00:03:25.410 --> 00:03:30.750

00:03:34.590 --> 00:03:38.160
 works with a non- ingredient 

00:03:36.240 --> 00:03:40.260
 specialized and some supermarkets 

00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:43.500

00:03:45.560 --> 00:03:51.290
 I like food a little more 

00:03:47.970 --> 00:03:51.290

00:04:19.769 --> 00:04:23.549

 I separated the beans from the cooking spout 

00:05:15.479 --> 00:05:23.440
