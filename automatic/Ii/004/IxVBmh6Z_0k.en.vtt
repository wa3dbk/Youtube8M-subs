00:03:41.629 --> 00:03:49.790
 There is a class where everyone can participate without a good 9-minute child 

00:03:45.319 --> 00:03:52.670
 So, to see if there are any alienated or passive children in all 

00:03:49.790 --> 00:03:57.560
 It is an important role for the teacher. 

00:03:52.670 --> 00:04:00.890

 Compared to the abundance of all kinds of collaborative research 

00:05:14.260 --> 00:05:16.680
 Let's go. 

00:05:17.260 --> 00:05:24.730
 Even through discussions, we have a variety of indirect experiences, 

00:05:21.460 --> 00:05:29.480
 Being able to look at society from the point of view 

00:05:24.730 --> 00:05:33.830
 Give a real society that Seo-san wants to give to children 

00:05:29.480 --> 00:05:36.380
 Ah, I do not want to hear about humans at all. 

00:05:33.830 --> 00:05:40.700
 It was the first time I had taken it before. 

00:05:36.380 --> 00:05:42.870
 And let's have fun, and that's the two things apart just to ask this 

00:05:40.700 --> 00:05:47.190
 I think. 

00:05:42.870 --> 00:05:52.800
 The teacher does not want the reaction or the subject right away in class . 

00:05:47.190 --> 00:05:57.660
 Surgery in your life , you have to be hospitalized , you have to go to the moxa parma 

00:05:52.800 --> 00:06:02.669
 This is important, but it is important to announce it, 

00:05:57.660 --> 00:06:05.699
 It's easier to remember when you come to the stars in your own life . 

00:06:02.669 --> 00:06:09.479

00:06:05.699 --> 00:06:12.750

00:06:23.460 --> 00:06:27.680

00:06:29.070 --> 00:06:35.729
 I think they're seven by the way. 

00:06:32.070 --> 00:06:40.259
 It's just the most important thing in a discussion class 

00:06:35.729 --> 00:06:44.759
 Teachers, of course, would like to have a lot of experience. 

00:06:40.259 --> 00:06:50.099
 If you do not have a direct experience , 

00:06:44.759 --> 00:06:51.300
 I think you should be able to show them to your kids. 

00:06:50.099 --> 00:06:55.589
 Language 

00:06:51.300 --> 00:07:01.039
