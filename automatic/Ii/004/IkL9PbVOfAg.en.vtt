00:00:30.949 --> 00:00:33.950
 their team but in the way that we pass normally state 

00:00:34.870 --> 00:00:37.210

 to the champion 

00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:48.830
 past is already born 

00:00:48.830 --> 00:00:50.700

00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:00.570
 is passed on one side 

00:01:02.030 --> 00:01:05.030
 none of this is difficult 

00:01:08.370 --> 00:01:11.630
 obviously crimes are going to be fatal min 

00:01:12.310 --> 00:01:15.180
 who wields years has cancer 

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:18.180

 what's up here 

00:01:40.060 --> 00:01:41.890
 it's this little one 

00:01:41.890 --> 00:01:43.760
 at this junction of redness 

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:45.470
 I get the cuticle 

00:01:45.470 --> 00:01:49.850
 usually what happens when you have just passed the enamel you step deep and 

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:52.650
 this multitouch finish 

00:01:52.650 --> 00:01:56.530
 so it's a way for you guys not to worry about finishing you guys 

00:01:56.530 --> 00:02:00.060
 they do it well after they have already gone down with the ball contenders 

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:03.980

00:02:03.980 --> 00:02:06.980
