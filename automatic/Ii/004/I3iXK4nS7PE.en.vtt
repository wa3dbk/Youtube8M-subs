 the 

00:00:04.780 --> 00:00:07.780
 shit 

00:00:08.409 --> 00:00:11.409
 re 

00:00:13.859 --> 00:00:16.909
 and as in the first instance was it interpreted as a very 

00:00:16.909 --> 00:00:20.230
 trend right now it's the patch we use to quit smoking 

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:25.230
 act to fight the pain to sleep mm to have a better life 

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:29.670
 better brief today we use these little stickers this body for 

00:00:29.669 --> 00:00:33.910
 all and anything but then is it really efficient how does it work 

00:00:33.910 --> 00:00:36.910
 it is a report of Baptist denounce herodote last 

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:42.950
 the mezzos at 118 600 kilos budget what's called a beast of muscles 

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:45.950
 for him the sport is all his life 

00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:52.450
 but he manages to attract so much will that has his little secret this badge 

00:00:52.450 --> 00:00:55.410
 stuck on the body 

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:58.860
 then I leave not starting because I'm really used to it 

00:00:58.860 --> 00:01:02.410
 raising my body to the test and intensive training for me 

00:01:02.410 --> 00:01:04.800
 it's important to put the patch that protects me 

00:01:04.800 --> 00:01:07.920
 psychologically and physically I really feel the effects so I have 

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:09.260
 need each workout 

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:11.270
 and I do not ask myself the question 

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:14.270
 the idea thoroughly of myself past this article 

00:01:14.800 --> 00:01:18.590
 at 33 years old who will be able to view images impossible for him 

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:22.930
 to do without it every day is the same ritual on his shoulder a patch 

00:01:22.930 --> 00:01:24.920

 on the knee a second patient since lowering the warm up 

00:01:28.210 --> 00:01:32.310
 he adds even a third on the elbow but that's why it's me 

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:33.750
 given the most elbow yards 

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:36.680
 and putting one step that I find it much more natural 

00:01:36.680 --> 00:01:38.510
 and for me it's very effective 

00:01:38.510 --> 00:01:40.410
 like that I prevent the pain 

00:01:40.410 --> 00:01:42.400
 and I think that much slower and stronger 

00:01:42.400 --> 00:01:44.890
 it is profitable 100% of the trainings 

00:01:44.890 --> 00:01:48.430
 thanks to plant extracts liters are less pain and after two 

00:01:48.430 --> 00:01:50.700

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:53.790
 we have not finished with the practices

 the agent take a good shower that I die science so a good shower 

00:01:57.620 --> 00:02:00.630
 more than a page circulation I'm not ready to shower 

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:02.990
 it's important for the brand that assumes 

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:06.750
 eight nice teams whose abilities have today patches on

 the seams the dead ends is it really effective and how that 

00:02:19.129 --> 00:02:22.069
 does it work we went to the doctor turned 

00:02:22.069 --> 00:02:25.159
 he is a generalist and with badges for these patients 

00:02:25.159 --> 00:02:28.439
 for this telethon a piece of adhesive cloth 

00:02:29.249 --> 00:02:31.329
 on the ground she for the most part 

00:02:31.329 --> 00:02:34.880
 an active ingredient that they are molecular plants besides 

00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:36.069
 it goes 

00:02:36.069 --> 00:02:37.489
 gradually 

00:02:37.489 --> 00:02:39.310
 the epidermis for then 

00:02:39.310 --> 00:02:42.389
 communicated about training inside the organization 

00:02:42.989 --> 00:02:47.190
 but it is true that it exists so that it is transferred so that is to say 

00:02:47.189 --> 00:02:51.379
 crosses the skin is tactical role that is breathed through the nose but how 

00:02:51.379 --> 00:02:56.120
 know if they are really very effective the first of things to 

00:02:56.120 --> 00:02:58.120
 watch when we buy a patch 

00:02:58.120 --> 00:02:59.170
 military transport 

00:02:59.170 --> 00:03:04.330
 c the active extracts of plants it is obvious that when one wants to have a 

00:03:04.330 --> 00:03:07.469
 anti-stress action must planters 

00:03:07.469 --> 00:03:11.479
 use either fit well to plans that act against stress 

00:03:11.479 --> 00:03:15.209
 some may be of very good quality but for your pocket may 

00:03:15.209 --> 00:03:18.700
 to be effectively of lesser quality or even downright effective 

00:03:19.369 --> 00:03:22.519
 so to know how are made this tax we have 

00:03:22.519 --> 00:03:26.239
 penetrated into one of the French labs that produces them here 

00:03:26.239 --> 00:03:30.049
 they will be close to 10 million pages each year or 40% of the market 

00:03:30.049 --> 00:03:34.980
 French in appearance the patch is a simple sticker and yet behind 

00:03:34.980 --> 00:03:39.699
 this banal dressing banal hiding years of scientific research 

00:03:39.699 --> 00:03:42.909
 aline and one of the researchers from this lab 

00:03:42.909 --> 00:03:45.749
 she is currently working on a new patch 

00:03:45.749 --> 00:03:48.909

00:03:49.499 --> 00:03:50.970
 it does not work the first time 

00:03:50.970 --> 00:03:53.849
 will do it a lot dessert 

00:03:53.849 --> 00:03:56.749
 to obtain the desired concentration of active ingredient 

00:03:56.749 --> 00:03:59.749
 for example had no certification we worked 

00:04:00.289 --> 00:04:04.139
 folder which represents about 200 remain at a level of formulation 

00:04:04.919 --> 00:04:07.919
 once the formula found it now needs support this country for 

00:04:07.919 --> 00:04:10.919
 make sure that it will not cause any energy on the body 

00:04:12.859 --> 00:04:13.760
 I would like us to talk 

00:04:13.760 --> 00:04:18.139
 l express will be ready activity is at the parisian internet party 

00:04:18.669 --> 00:04:20.489
 so the inner side actually 

00:04:20.489 --> 00:04:21.609
 it's this one 

00:04:21.609 --> 00:04:23.009
 contact on the skin 

00:04:23.009 --> 00:04:27.360
 when the project is validated the large-scale production of time 

00:04:27.360 --> 00:04:28.520
 finally start 

00:04:28.520 --> 00:04:31.550
 we have exceptionally been able to enter the extraction room 

00:04:31.550 --> 00:04:35.470

 Clinic of the vine flower of their titles 

00:04:38.150 --> 00:04:41.219

 total in the nfl actually did to the Qatari hub chain 

00:04:47.270 --> 00:04:50.270
 and we will do it 

00:04:50.979 --> 00:04:52.939
 French fans 

00:04:52.939 --> 00:04:55.150
 flamatt en what are patches waiting for? 

00:04:55.150 --> 00:04:59.470
 these videos have a market value of 50000 euros these pages are then 

00:04:59.470 --> 00:05:03.430
 sold in pharmacy on average the limited role and for four years the market 

00:05:03.430 --> 00:05:07.760
 explodes more than 15 million pages are sold each year in its 

00:05:07.759 --> 00:05:10.680
 patrick pharmacy and not felt the change 

00:05:10.680 --> 00:05:13.870
 formerly limited on dp it is extremely limited but since one year 

00:05:13.870 --> 00:05:16.279
 and half we realize that the request not 

00:05:16.279 --> 00:05:19.949
 growing and people are extremely interested in this type of 

00:05:19.949 --> 00:05:20.969
 treatment 

00:05:20.969 --> 00:05:24.400
 because here the down who is nowadays the secret of his success is 

00:05:24.399 --> 00:05:28.069
 may be in its price we take an example of this product if who 

00:05:28.069 --> 00:05:28.670
 allows 

00:05:28.670 --> 00:05:32.319
 so having two weeks of treatment for 750 

00:05:32.319 --> 00:05:36.050
 in comparison we introduced in the form of tablets treatments 

00:05:36.050 --> 00:05:37.499
 traditional 

00:05:37.499 --> 00:05:40.659
 for about 15 days to a month of treatment and we come to a sum 

00:05:40.659 --> 00:05:42.579
 which is two to three times larger so ultimately 

00:05:42.579 --> 00:05:45.189
 comparatively the pastel hardly to make its choice 

00:05:45.189 --> 00:05:48.490
 practical and less expensive it seduces more and more people 

00:05:48.490 --> 00:05:52.460
 nathalie world at age 31 she is flight attendant jet lag and 

00:05:52.460 --> 00:05:56.180
 missions work are daily but for a year to sleep when 

00:05:56.180 --> 00:05:59.860
 they want it she found the solution however not of this partnership 

00:05:59.860 --> 00:06:01.129
 will have time 

00:06:01.129 --> 00:06:02.610
 so for you 

00:06:02.610 --> 00:06:06.539
 moreover he does not force to sleep and there I still wonder not what 

00:06:06.539 --> 00:06:09.039
 that's when it starts to do well 

00:06:09.039 --> 00:06:12.499
 a benefit that passes for me this is their practical side I put them in 

00:06:12.499 --> 00:06:14.409
 my purse containing no place 

00:06:14.409 --> 00:06:18.559
 and then good the day without that I think unlike the much needed tablets 

00:06:19.080 --> 00:06:22.610
 the respect some of them are even faster 

00:06:23.520 --> 00:06:26.850
 tarpaulins to sleep but better yet there are also more 

00:06:26.849 --> 00:06:27.659
 wacky 

00:06:27.659 --> 00:06:30.899
 you are at delphine a real chocolate addict but since 

00:06:30.899 --> 00:06:33.190
 a few weeks this 27 year old girl 

00:06:33.190 --> 00:06:35.980
 tries to limit its consumption to keep the line 

00:06:35.980 --> 00:06:39.099
 so in the face of failures of chocolates precisely 

00:06:39.099 --> 00:06:40.090
 it's a fake 

00:06:40.090 --> 00:06:41.539
 clearly no 

00:06:41.539 --> 00:06:45.550
 not long ago from london it's a whole chocolate space that's 

00:06:45.550 --> 00:06:49.789
 sensé an Israeli TV that does not stop there but in his belly 

00:06:49.789 --> 00:06:53.319
 every morning for two weeks she sticks on her wrist this patch 

00:06:53.319 --> 00:06:57.259
 supposed to diffuse a smell of vanilla at 30 euros the box delphine waits 

00:06:57.259 --> 00:06:58.830
 a lot of this new treatment 

00:06:58.830 --> 00:07:02.249
 it is then more efficient to have this attitude 

00:07:02.249 --> 00:07:05.589
 for this price zim's every day inevitably I think a little 

00:07:06.119 --> 00:07:08.339
 unia is that logical 

00:07:08.339 --> 00:07:09.379
 on the other hand 

00:07:09.379 --> 00:07:12.029
 finally on the side air diffuser side 

00:07:12.029 --> 00:07:13.319
 I am not convinced 

00:07:13.319 --> 00:07:16.699
 the new reflex manager for thousands of French 

00:07:16.699 --> 00:07:19.979
 in the face of this phenomenon we must remain very careful if the patches 

00:07:19.979 --> 00:07:21.860
 transdermal are highly supervised 

00:07:21.860 --> 00:07:25.979
 the olfactory patches of many voices including a certification to be sold 

00:07:25.979 --> 00:07:28.160
 allianz is done rest to prove
