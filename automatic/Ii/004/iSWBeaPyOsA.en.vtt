now<00:00:25.740> a<00:00:25.769> lot<00:00:26.039> of<00:00:26.130> people<00:00:26.340> are<00:00:26.430> saying<00:00:26.580> that<00:00:26.760> this

00:00:26.870 --> 00:00:26.880 
now a lot of people are saying that this

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:28.820 
now a lot of people are saying that this
cannot<00:00:27.240> be<00:00:27.420> spring<00:00:27.689> Freddy<00:00:27.960> because<00:00:28.289> of<00:00:28.410> a<00:00:28.529> set

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:28.830 
cannot be spring Freddy because of a set

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:29.779 
cannot be spring Freddy because of a set
few<00:00:29.220> particular

00:00:29.779 --> 00:00:29.789 
few particular

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:31.279 
few particular
things<00:00:30.210> now<00:00:30.570> we're<00:00:30.720> actually<00:00:30.840> going<00:00:31.109> to<00:00:31.170> be

00:00:31.279 --> 00:00:31.289 
things now we're actually going to be

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:32.959 
things now we're actually going to be
debunking<00:00:31.740> this<00:00:31.859> improving<00:00:32.369> why<00:00:32.579> this<00:00:32.640> is

00:00:32.959 --> 00:00:32.969 
debunking this improving why this is

00:00:32.969 --> 00:00:35.750 
debunking this improving why this is
most<00:00:33.239> likely<00:00:33.600> spring<00:00:34.170> Freddy<00:00:34.500> yes<00:00:35.040> now<00:00:35.340> when<00:00:35.730> I

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:35.760 
most likely spring Freddy yes now when I

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:37.970 
most likely spring Freddy yes now when I
first<00:00:36.180> saw<00:00:36.390> this<00:00:36.540> image<00:00:36.750> we<00:00:37.320> both<00:00:37.500> know<00:00:37.710> it<00:00:37.860> I

00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:37.980 
first saw this image we both know it I

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:40.190 
first saw this image we both know it I
was<00:00:38.219> shrouded<00:00:38.460> in<00:00:38.790> red<00:00:39.149> and<00:00:39.390> yes<00:00:39.840> we<00:00:40.110> don't

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:40.200 
was shrouded in red and yes we don't

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:41.750 
was shrouded in red and yes we don't
know<00:00:40.350> whether<00:00:40.559> or<00:00:40.710> not<00:00:40.739> this<00:00:40.980> was<00:00:41.219> a<00:00:41.280> Halloween

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:41.760 
know whether or not this was a Halloween

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:43.280 
know whether or not this was a Halloween
theme<00:00:42.120> because<00:00:42.510> obviously<00:00:42.629> it's<00:00:42.930> released<00:00:43.200> on

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:43.290 
theme because obviously it's released on

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:45.410 
theme because obviously it's released on
Halloween<00:00:43.710> and<00:00:43.920> even<00:00:44.399> the<00:00:44.489> Scott<00:00:44.700> games<00:00:44.940> logos

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:45.420 
Halloween and even the Scott games logos

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:47.569 
Halloween and even the Scott games logos
like<00:00:45.840> covered<00:00:46.289> in<00:00:46.350> red<00:00:46.620> so<00:00:46.920> I<00:00:46.950> decided<00:00:47.340> yeah

00:00:47.569 --> 00:00:47.579 
like covered in red so I decided yeah

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:49.310 
like covered in red so I decided yeah
what<00:00:48.030> if<00:00:48.210> we<00:00:48.420> got<00:00:48.570> rid<00:00:48.690> of<00:00:48.780> these<00:00:48.930> Reds<00:00:49.200> because

00:00:49.310 --> 00:00:49.320 
what if we got rid of these Reds because

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:51.139 
what if we got rid of these Reds because
this<00:00:49.559> red<00:00:49.770> seems<00:00:49.950> to<00:00:50.129> be<00:00:50.219> really<00:00:50.460> overpowering

00:00:51.139 --> 00:00:51.149 
this red seems to be really overpowering

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:53.630 
this red seems to be really overpowering
the<00:00:51.390> image<00:00:51.739> load<00:00:52.739> leads<00:00:53.039> over<00:00:53.430> all<00:00:53.550> the

00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:53.640 
the image load leads over all the

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:55.040 
the image load leads over all the
textures<00:00:54.090> doesn't<00:00:54.360> it<00:00:54.449> it's<00:00:54.660> just<00:00:54.780> such<00:00:55.020> a

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:55.050 
textures doesn't it it's just such a

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:57.619 
textures doesn't it it's just such a
vibrant<00:00:55.680> red<00:00:55.860> yeah<00:00:56.100> I<00:00:56.340> lowered<00:00:56.760> it<00:00:56.850> down<00:00:56.879> quite

00:00:57.619 --> 00:00:57.629 
vibrant red yeah I lowered it down quite

00:00:57.629 --> 00:00:59.689 
vibrant red yeah I lowered it down quite
a<00:00:57.690> bit<00:00:57.809> and<00:00:58.199> what<00:00:58.530> you'll<00:00:58.649> notice<00:00:58.800> is<00:00:59.039> that<00:00:59.219> it

00:00:59.689 --> 00:00:59.699 
a bit and what you'll notice is that it

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:01.279 
a bit and what you'll notice is that it
kind<00:00:59.969> of<00:01:00.030> turns<00:01:00.239> into<00:01:00.420> the<00:01:00.570> same<00:01:00.780> color<00:01:01.109> as

00:01:01.279 --> 00:01:01.289 
kind of turns into the same color as

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:03.110 
kind of turns into the same color as
spring-trap<00:01:01.890> which<00:01:02.129> means<00:01:02.370> that<00:01:02.520> this<00:01:02.699> could

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:03.120 
spring-trap which means that this could

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:05.210 
spring-trap which means that this could
indeed<00:01:03.390> be<00:01:03.449> spring<00:01:04.049> Freddy<00:01:04.290> yeah<00:01:04.830> so<00:01:05.070> this

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:05.220 
indeed be spring Freddy yeah so this

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:06.890 
indeed be spring Freddy yeah so this
could<00:01:05.369> actually<00:01:05.460> be<00:01:05.670> another<00:01:06.180> golden<00:01:06.780> or

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:06.900 
could actually be another golden or

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:08.899 
could actually be another golden or
should<00:01:07.049> I<00:01:07.110> say<00:01:07.290> yellow<00:01:07.560> animatronic<00:01:08.280> and<00:01:08.490> even

00:01:08.899 --> 00:01:08.909 
should I say yellow animatronic and even

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:09.890 
should I say yellow animatronic and even
if<00:01:08.970> it's<00:01:09.090> not<00:01:09.240> golden<00:01:09.570> it<00:01:09.630> could<00:01:09.780> actually

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:09.900 
if it's not golden it could actually

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:11.990 
if it's not golden it could actually
possess<00:01:10.380> the<00:01:10.650> exact<00:01:10.920> same<00:01:11.100> colors<00:01:11.490> as<00:01:11.670> Freddy

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:12.000 
possess the exact same colors as Freddy

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:13.789 
possess the exact same colors as Freddy
which<00:01:12.270> would<00:01:12.420> be<00:01:12.600> still<00:01:13.049> interesting<00:01:13.530> it<00:01:13.650> and

00:01:13.789 --> 00:01:13.799 
which would be still interesting it and

00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:15.230 
which would be still interesting it and
it<00:01:13.860> was<00:01:13.979> still<00:01:14.189> back<00:01:14.400> up<00:01:14.549> the<00:01:14.640> idea<00:01:14.939> that<00:01:15.090> this

00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:15.240 
it was still back up the idea that this

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:17.270 
it was still back up the idea that this
character<00:01:15.630> is<00:01:15.780> most<00:01:16.290> certainly<00:01:16.799> spring

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:17.280 
character is most certainly spring

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:19.490 
character is most certainly spring
Freddy<00:01:17.610> definitely<00:01:18.540> yes<00:01:18.750> now<00:01:19.080> I<00:01:19.110> think<00:01:19.290> the

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:19.500 
Freddy definitely yes now I think the

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:20.870 
Freddy definitely yes now I think the
second<00:01:19.890> thing<00:01:19.920> we<00:01:20.100> need<00:01:20.130> to<00:01:20.340> talk<00:01:20.520> about<00:01:20.640> is

00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:20.880 
second thing we need to talk about is

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:22.550 
second thing we need to talk about is
the<00:01:21.000> generation<00:01:21.570> of<00:01:21.659> this<00:01:21.780> animatronic<00:01:22.140> and

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:22.560 
the generation of this animatronic and

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:24.499 
the generation of this animatronic and
white<00:01:22.770> this<00:01:23.040> may<00:01:23.250> actually<00:01:23.310> work<00:01:23.729> alongside

00:01:24.499 --> 00:01:24.509 
white this may actually work alongside

00:01:24.509 --> 00:01:26.570 
white this may actually work alongside
spring<00:01:25.200> bonnie<00:01:25.439> now<00:01:25.890> if<00:01:26.009> you<00:01:26.100> actually<00:01:26.220> go

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:26.580 
spring bonnie now if you actually go

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:28.640 
spring bonnie now if you actually go
into<00:01:26.610> the<00:01:27.090> characters<00:01:27.570> face<00:01:27.869> you<00:01:28.320> actually

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:28.650 
into the characters face you actually

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:29.870 
into the characters face you actually
see<00:01:28.799> that<00:01:28.890> this<00:01:29.009> character<00:01:29.369> seems<00:01:29.579> to<00:01:29.759> have

00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:29.880 
see that this character seems to have

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:31.819 
see that this character seems to have
the<00:01:30.030> same<00:01:30.060> casing<00:01:30.930> around<00:01:31.079> the<00:01:31.350> eyes<00:01:31.500> that

00:01:31.819 --> 00:01:31.829 
the same casing around the eyes that

00:01:31.829 --> 00:01:34.340 
the same casing around the eyes that
spring<00:01:32.250> trap<00:01:32.670> or<00:01:32.880> spring<00:01:33.210> bonnie<00:01:33.509> also<00:01:34.079> does

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:34.350 
spring trap or spring bonnie also does

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:36.800 
spring trap or spring bonnie also does
yes<00:01:35.070> and<00:01:35.369> this<00:01:35.820> could<00:01:35.970> mean<00:01:36.150> that<00:01:36.299> this<00:01:36.509> was

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:36.810 
yes and this could mean that this was

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:38.719 
yes and this could mean that this was
spring<00:01:37.350> traps<00:01:37.619> partner-in-crime<00:01:38.070> that<00:01:38.640> we

00:01:38.719 --> 00:01:38.729 
spring traps partner-in-crime that we

00:01:38.729 --> 00:01:41.300 
spring traps partner-in-crime that we
see<00:01:39.000> in<00:01:39.240> the<00:01:39.570> sister<00:01:40.259> locations<00:01:40.829> of<00:01:41.009> the

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:41.310 
see in the sister locations of the

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:43.940 
see in the sister locations of the
Freddy<00:01:41.520> fazbear's<00:01:42.000> pizza<00:01:42.210> locations<00:01:42.950> exactly

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:43.950 
Freddy fazbear's pizza locations exactly

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:45.499 
Freddy fazbear's pizza locations exactly
and<00:01:44.100> two<00:01:44.340> more<00:01:44.520> things<00:01:44.759> one<00:01:45.030> of<00:01:45.149> which<00:01:45.299> you

00:01:45.499 --> 00:01:45.509 
and two more things one of which you

00:01:45.509 --> 00:01:46.969 
and two more things one of which you
actually<00:01:45.869> brought<00:01:46.229> up<00:01:46.470> with<00:01:46.590> the<00:01:46.649> Rhine<00:01:46.829> is

00:01:46.969 --> 00:01:46.979 
actually brought up with the Rhine is

00:01:46.979 --> 00:01:48.530 
actually brought up with the Rhine is
the<00:01:47.100> fact<00:01:47.280> that<00:01:47.369> this<00:01:47.700> character<00:01:48.119> seems<00:01:48.299> to<00:01:48.420> be

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:48.540 
the fact that this character seems to be

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:50.210 
the fact that this character seems to be
withered<00:01:48.869> in<00:01:49.020> such<00:01:49.290> a<00:01:49.320> way<00:01:49.530> which<00:01:49.710> resembles

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:50.220 
withered in such a way which resembles

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:52.069 
withered in such a way which resembles
the<00:01:50.280> same<00:01:50.610> style<00:01:51.060> or<00:01:51.390> should<00:01:51.540> I<00:01:51.600> say<00:01:51.750> the<00:01:51.899> same

00:01:52.069 --> 00:01:52.079 
the same style or should I say the same

00:01:52.079 --> 00:01:53.990 
the same style or should I say the same
level<00:01:52.380> of<00:01:52.470> damage<00:01:52.829> that<00:01:52.860> spring-trap<00:01:53.549> also

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:54.000 
level of damage that spring-trap also

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:55.700 
level of damage that spring-trap also
has<00:01:54.240> which<00:01:54.720> could<00:01:55.020> mean<00:01:55.200> that<00:01:55.350> they've<00:01:55.530> been

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:55.710 
has which could mean that they've been

00:01:55.710 --> 00:01:57.410 
has which could mean that they've been
left<00:01:55.890> to<00:01:56.040> rot<00:01:56.070> for<00:01:56.430> the<00:01:56.490> same<00:01:56.700> amount<00:01:56.939> of<00:01:57.119> time

00:01:57.410 --> 00:01:57.420 
left to rot for the same amount of time

00:01:57.420 --> 00:01:59.539 
left to rot for the same amount of time
definitely<00:01:57.770> exactly<00:01:58.770> and<00:01:58.890> then<00:01:58.979> the<00:01:59.100> final

00:01:59.539 --> 00:01:59.549 
definitely exactly and then the final

00:01:59.549 --> 00:02:01.249 
definitely exactly and then the final
thing<00:01:59.579> is<00:01:59.909> actually<00:02:00.210> looking<00:02:00.509> at<00:02:00.659> the<00:02:00.719> arm<00:02:01.020> of

00:02:01.249 --> 00:02:01.259 
thing is actually looking at the arm of

00:02:01.259 --> 00:02:02.810 
thing is actually looking at the arm of
this<00:02:01.380> animatronic<00:02:01.680> if<00:02:02.040> you<00:02:02.159> actually<00:02:02.549> see

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:02.820 
this animatronic if you actually see

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:05.270 
this animatronic if you actually see
careful<00:02:03.299> enough<00:02:03.689> it<00:02:03.960> looks<00:02:04.290> very<00:02:04.530> similar<00:02:04.950> to

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:05.280 
careful enough it looks very similar to

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:06.679 
careful enough it looks very similar to
the<00:02:05.369> endoskeleton<00:02:05.790> we<00:02:06.180> see<00:02:06.360> inside<00:02:06.630> of

00:02:06.679 --> 00:02:06.689 
the endoskeleton we see inside of

00:02:06.689 --> 00:02:09.320 
the endoskeleton we see inside of
spring-trap<00:02:07.500> also<00:02:08.009> so<00:02:08.310> I<00:02:08.520> really<00:02:09.060> think<00:02:09.270> these

00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:09.330 
spring-trap also so I really think these

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:10.969 
spring-trap also so I really think these
two<00:02:09.539> animatronics<00:02:10.080> coincide<00:02:10.619> with<00:02:10.649> one

00:02:10.969 --> 00:02:10.979 
two animatronics coincide with one

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:12.740 
two animatronics coincide with one
another<00:02:11.220> and<00:02:11.430> an<00:02:11.700> interesting<00:02:12.300> question<00:02:12.480> I

00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:12.750 
another and an interesting question I

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:13.760 
another and an interesting question I
actually<00:02:12.840> posed<00:02:13.260> with<00:02:13.500> a

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:13.770 
actually posed with a

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:15.830 
actually posed with a
was<00:02:14.100> actually<00:02:14.280> where<00:02:14.790> was<00:02:15.090> this<00:02:15.270> guy<00:02:15.480> between

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:15.840 
was actually where was this guy between

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:17.690 
was actually where was this guy between
five<00:02:16.080> nights<00:02:16.320> at<00:02:16.440> Freddy's<00:02:16.740> 1<00:02:17.010> and<00:02:17.280> 5<00:02:17.460> nights

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:17.700 
five nights at Freddy's 1 and 5 nights

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:19.790 
five nights at Freddy's 1 and 5 nights
at<00:02:17.820> Freddy's<00:02:18.120> 3<00:02:18.150> yeah<00:02:19.110> because<00:02:19.290> he<00:02:19.470> must<00:02:19.650> have

00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:19.800 
at Freddy's 3 yeah because he must have

00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:21.290 
at Freddy's 3 yeah because he must have
been<00:02:19.980> in<00:02:20.130> the<00:02:20.220> establishment<00:02:20.700> somewhere

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:21.300 
been in the establishment somewhere

00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:22.520 
been in the establishment somewhere
because<00:02:21.510> obviously<00:02:21.690> if<00:02:22.020> springtrap's

00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:22.530 
because obviously if springtrap's

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:24.380 
because obviously if springtrap's
existed<00:02:23.160> through<00:02:23.460> all<00:02:23.700> that<00:02:23.880> time<00:02:24.150> then

00:02:24.380 --> 00:02:24.390 
existed through all that time then

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:26.330 
existed through all that time then
spring<00:02:24.630> freddy<00:02:24.870> must<00:02:25.080> have<00:02:25.200> existed<00:02:25.440> also<00:02:26.040> so

00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:26.340 
spring freddy must have existed also so

00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:28.700 
spring freddy must have existed also so
where<00:02:26.940> was<00:02:27.210> he<00:02:27.390> in<00:02:27.540> all<00:02:27.750> the<00:02:27.960> establishments

00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:28.710 
where was he in all the establishments

00:02:28.710 --> 00:02:30.080 
where was he in all the establishments
exactly<00:02:29.460> I<00:02:29.490> think<00:02:29.580> it's<00:02:29.850> definitely

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:30.090 
exactly I think it's definitely

00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:32.390 
exactly I think it's definitely
something<00:02:30.330> we<00:02:30.690> need<00:02:30.720> to<00:02:30.900> know<00:02:31.260> and<00:02:31.500> hopefully

00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:32.400 
something we need to know and hopefully

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:34.130 
something we need to know and hopefully
as<00:02:32.580> time<00:02:32.820> goes<00:02:33.030> on<00:02:33.150> and<00:02:33.360> more<00:02:33.390> teaser<00:02:33.780> release

00:02:34.130 --> 00:02:34.140 
as time goes on and more teaser release

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:36.110 
as time goes on and more teaser release
we<00:02:34.320> might<00:02:34.470> really<00:02:34.680> understand<00:02:35.250> this<00:02:35.460> yes

00:02:36.110 --> 00:02:36.120 
we might really understand this yes

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:38.120 
we might really understand this yes
hopefully<00:02:36.420> sure<00:02:36.840> ok<00:02:37.410> so<00:02:37.470> now<00:02:37.830> we're<00:02:37.980> going<00:02:38.070> to

00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:38.130 
hopefully sure ok so now we're going to

00:02:38.130 --> 00:02:40.190 
hopefully sure ok so now we're going to
move<00:02:38.280> over<00:02:38.460> to<00:02:38.700> possibly<00:02:39.060> the<00:02:39.210> most<00:02:39.420> important

00:02:40.190 --> 00:02:40.200 
move over to possibly the most important

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:41.870 
move over to possibly the most important
part<00:02:40.440> of<00:02:40.500> this<00:02:40.590> video<00:02:40.860> as<00:02:41.010> to<00:02:41.040> why<00:02:41.400> we<00:02:41.610> believe

00:02:41.870 --> 00:02:41.880 
part of this video as to why we believe

00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:44.060 
part of this video as to why we believe
this<00:02:42.060> character<00:02:42.450> to<00:02:42.540> be<00:02:42.720> spring<00:02:43.380> Freddy<00:02:43.650> now<00:02:43.830> a

00:02:44.060 --> 00:02:44.070 
this character to be spring Freddy now a

00:02:44.070 --> 00:02:45.830 
this character to be spring Freddy now a
lot<00:02:44.610> of<00:02:44.640> people<00:02:44.910> have<00:02:45.210> been<00:02:45.270> saying<00:02:45.330> that<00:02:45.600> this

00:02:45.830 --> 00:02:45.840 
lot of people have been saying that this

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:47.360 
lot of people have been saying that this
cannot<00:02:46.260> be<00:02:46.440> spring<00:02:46.740> Freddy<00:02:47.010> for<00:02:47.160> one

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:47.370 
cannot be spring Freddy for one

00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:49.790 
cannot be spring Freddy for one
particular<00:02:47.700> reason<00:02:48.330> and<00:02:48.480> that<00:02:49.200> reason<00:02:49.260> being

00:02:49.790 --> 00:02:49.800 
particular reason and that reason being

00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:52.490 
particular reason and that reason being
it<00:02:50.010> has<00:02:50.040> three<00:02:50.700> fingers<00:02:51.000> and<00:02:51.270> one<00:02:51.720> thumb<00:02:52.140> so<00:02:52.380> it

00:02:52.490 --> 00:02:52.500 
it has three fingers and one thumb so it

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:55.250 
it has three fingers and one thumb so it
cannot<00:02:52.740> fit<00:02:53.010> human<00:02:53.400> hand<00:02:53.640> inside<00:02:54.120> now<00:02:54.960> there

00:02:55.250 --> 00:02:55.260 
cannot fit human hand inside now there

00:02:55.260 --> 00:02:56.480 
cannot fit human hand inside now there
is<00:02:55.350> actually<00:02:55.620> something<00:02:55.860> wrong<00:02:56.250> with<00:02:56.400> this

00:02:56.480 --> 00:02:56.490 
is actually something wrong with this

00:02:56.490 --> 00:02:58.580 
is actually something wrong with this
idea<00:02:56.850> and<00:02:57.000> now<00:02:57.060> if<00:02:57.240> you<00:02:57.330> go<00:02:57.540> in<00:02:57.690> very<00:02:57.960> close<00:02:58.380> to

00:02:58.580 --> 00:02:58.590 
idea and now if you go in very close to

00:02:58.590 --> 00:03:00.410 
idea and now if you go in very close to
the<00:02:58.710> hand<00:02:58.920> you<00:02:59.220> will<00:02:59.310> actually<00:02:59.640> see<00:02:59.850> a<00:02:59.880> fourth

00:03:00.410 --> 00:03:00.420 
the hand you will actually see a fourth

00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:02.510 
the hand you will actually see a fourth
finger<00:03:00.840> and<00:03:00.960> it's<00:03:01.050> actually<00:03:01.500> the<00:03:01.710> ring<00:03:01.980> finger

00:03:02.510 --> 00:03:02.520 
finger and it's actually the ring finger

00:03:02.520 --> 00:03:04.190 
finger and it's actually the ring finger
that<00:03:02.910> is<00:03:02.970> being<00:03:03.300> hidden<00:03:03.480> the<00:03:03.720> ring<00:03:03.900> finger

00:03:04.190 --> 00:03:04.200 
that is being hidden the ring finger

00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:05.810 
that is being hidden the ring finger
being<00:03:04.410> the<00:03:04.770> finger<00:03:05.070> in<00:03:05.220> between<00:03:05.310> the<00:03:05.520> middle

00:03:05.810 --> 00:03:05.820 
being the finger in between the middle

00:03:05.820 --> 00:03:07.190 
being the finger in between the middle
and<00:03:06.030> the<00:03:06.210> little<00:03:06.510> finger<00:03:06.690> now<00:03:06.930> if<00:03:07.110> you

00:03:07.190 --> 00:03:07.200 
and the little finger now if you

00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:09.230 
and the little finger now if you
actually<00:03:07.350> do<00:03:07.650> zoom<00:03:07.860> in<00:03:07.980> as<00:03:08.130> I<00:03:08.310> say<00:03:08.580> you<00:03:09.000> almost

00:03:09.230 --> 00:03:09.240 
actually do zoom in as I say you almost

00:03:09.240 --> 00:03:12.170 
actually do zoom in as I say you almost
certainly<00:03:09.570> see<00:03:10.080> it<00:03:10.200> yes<00:03:10.950> and<00:03:11.190> this<00:03:11.700> debunked

00:03:12.170 --> 00:03:12.180 
certainly see it yes and this debunked

00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:14.540 
certainly see it yes and this debunked
the<00:03:12.420> theory<00:03:12.690> that<00:03:12.840> it's<00:03:13.200> just<00:03:13.560> another<00:03:13.860> new

00:03:14.540 --> 00:03:14.550 
the theory that it's just another new

00:03:14.550 --> 00:03:16.280 
the theory that it's just another new
animatronic<00:03:15.360> this<00:03:15.600> is<00:03:15.780> most<00:03:16.050> definitely

00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:16.290 
animatronic this is most definitely

00:03:16.290 --> 00:03:18.560 
animatronic this is most definitely
spring<00:03:17.010> Freddy<00:03:17.280> definitely<00:03:18.120> from<00:03:18.270> the<00:03:18.390> same

00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:18.570 
spring Freddy definitely from the same

00:03:18.570 --> 00:03:20.360 
spring Freddy definitely from the same
generation<00:03:19.230> that<00:03:19.380> spring-trap<00:03:19.830> was<00:03:20.010> produced

00:03:20.360 --> 00:03:20.370 
generation that spring-trap was produced

00:03:20.370 --> 00:03:22.220 
generation that spring-trap was produced
it<00:03:20.550> has<00:03:20.730> to<00:03:20.940> be<00:03:21.030> the<00:03:21.180> same<00:03:21.390> and<00:03:21.660> you<00:03:21.900> know<00:03:22.050> if

00:03:22.220 --> 00:03:22.230 
it has to be the same and you know if

00:03:22.230 --> 00:03:23.720 
it has to be the same and you know if
that<00:03:22.440> is<00:03:22.680> that's<00:03:22.890> the<00:03:23.070> case<00:03:23.280> then<00:03:23.520> this<00:03:23.640> is

00:03:23.720 --> 00:03:23.730 
that is that's the case then this is

00:03:23.730 --> 00:03:25.640 
that is that's the case then this is
obviously<00:03:23.850> while<00:03:24.420> most<00:03:24.720> likely<00:03:25.320> the<00:03:25.470> other

00:03:25.640 --> 00:03:25.650 
obviously while most likely the other

00:03:25.650 --> 00:03:27.650 
obviously while most likely the other
animatronic<00:03:26.310> that<00:03:26.430> had<00:03:26.610> the<00:03:26.760> crank<00:03:27.120> ability

00:03:27.650 --> 00:03:27.660 
animatronic that had the crank ability

00:03:27.660 --> 00:03:29.360 
animatronic that had the crank ability
where<00:03:27.870> people<00:03:28.140> could<00:03:28.290> climb<00:03:28.470> inside<00:03:28.860> and<00:03:29.160> also

00:03:29.360 --> 00:03:29.370 
where people could climb inside and also

00:03:29.370 --> 00:03:30.740 
where people could climb inside and also
acts<00:03:29.580> inside<00:03:29.910> the<00:03:30.030> suit<00:03:30.240> without<00:03:30.630> the

00:03:30.740 --> 00:03:30.750 
acts inside the suit without the

00:03:30.750 --> 00:03:32.540 
acts inside the suit without the
endoskeleton<00:03:31.170> being<00:03:31.709> there<00:03:31.980> or<00:03:32.190> at<00:03:32.280> least<00:03:32.430> by

00:03:32.540 --> 00:03:32.550 
endoskeleton being there or at least by

00:03:32.550 --> 00:03:34.460 
endoskeleton being there or at least by
pushing<00:03:32.820> it<00:03:33.030> to<00:03:33.150> the<00:03:33.209> side<00:03:33.300> should<00:03:33.720> I<00:03:33.810> say<00:03:34.020> yeah

00:03:34.460 --> 00:03:34.470 
pushing it to the side should I say yeah

00:03:34.470 --> 00:03:36.740 
pushing it to the side should I say yeah
and<00:03:34.740> this<00:03:34.890> opens<00:03:35.310> up<00:03:35.430> the<00:03:35.670> storyline<00:03:36.300> to<00:03:36.570> five

00:03:36.740 --> 00:03:36.750 
and this opens up the storyline to five

00:03:36.750 --> 00:03:38.210 
and this opens up the storyline to five
nights<00:03:36.930> at<00:03:37.110> Freddy's<00:03:37.380> 4<00:03:37.410> is<00:03:37.740> this<00:03:37.860> going<00:03:38.040> to<00:03:38.100> be

00:03:38.210 --> 00:03:38.220 
nights at Freddy's 4 is this going to be

00:03:38.220 --> 00:03:39.770 
nights at Freddy's 4 is this going to be
from<00:03:38.430> the<00:03:38.520> perspective<00:03:39.030> of<00:03:39.150> what<00:03:39.630> we

00:03:39.770 --> 00:03:39.780 
from the perspective of what we

00:03:39.780 --> 00:03:41.660 
from the perspective of what we
theorized<00:03:40.230> to<00:03:40.260> be<00:03:40.410> two<00:03:40.680> purple<00:03:41.130> guys<00:03:41.310> so<00:03:41.550> is

00:03:41.660 --> 00:03:41.670 
theorized to be two purple guys so is

00:03:41.670 --> 00:03:43.550 
theorized to be two purple guys so is
this<00:03:41.730> the<00:03:41.910> pink<00:03:42.150> guy<00:03:42.450> that<00:03:42.720> we've<00:03:42.900> always<00:03:43.260> been

00:03:43.550 --> 00:03:43.560 
this the pink guy that we've always been

00:03:43.560 --> 00:03:46.100 
this the pink guy that we've always been
discussing<00:03:43.980> yes<00:03:44.760> exactly<00:03:45.000> and<00:03:45.360> you<00:03:45.660> know<00:03:45.780> just

00:03:46.100 --> 00:03:46.110 
discussing yes exactly and you know just

00:03:46.110 --> 00:03:47.930 
discussing yes exactly and you know just
before<00:03:46.260> we<00:03:46.620> actually<00:03:46.770> go<00:03:47.220> off<00:03:47.340> the<00:03:47.490> topic<00:03:47.820> of

00:03:47.930 --> 00:03:47.940 
before we actually go off the topic of

00:03:47.940 --> 00:03:49.370 
before we actually go off the topic of
this<00:03:48.090> guy<00:03:48.270> having<00:03:48.600> four<00:03:48.810> fingers<00:03:49.140> on<00:03:49.170> one

00:03:49.370 --> 00:03:49.380 
this guy having four fingers on one

00:03:49.380 --> 00:03:50.840 
this guy having four fingers on one
thumb<00:03:49.620> I<00:03:49.770> just<00:03:50.130> want<00:03:50.280> to<00:03:50.340> pick<00:03:50.459> up<00:03:50.610> on<00:03:50.730> a<00:03:50.760> few

00:03:50.840 --> 00:03:50.850 
thumb I just want to pick up on a few

00:03:50.850 --> 00:03:52.850 
thumb I just want to pick up on a few
key<00:03:51.300> details<00:03:51.510> as<00:03:51.930> to<00:03:51.990> why<00:03:52.260> this<00:03:52.320> is<00:03:52.590> the<00:03:52.680> case

00:03:52.850 --> 00:03:52.860 
key details as to why this is the case

00:03:52.860 --> 00:03:55.160 
key details as to why this is the case
so<00:03:53.130> if<00:03:53.400> we<00:03:53.610> zoom<00:03:53.850> in<00:03:54.000> very<00:03:54.270> close<00:03:54.630> to<00:03:54.840> the<00:03:54.930> hand

00:03:55.160 --> 00:03:55.170 
so if we zoom in very close to the hand

00:03:55.170 --> 00:03:56.600 
so if we zoom in very close to the hand
of<00:03:55.320> this<00:03:55.410> new<00:03:55.590> animatronic<00:03:56.130> and<00:03:56.310> you<00:03:56.370> look<00:03:56.520> at

00:03:56.600 --> 00:03:56.610 
of this new animatronic and you look at

00:03:56.610 --> 00:03:58.340 
of this new animatronic and you look at
the<00:03:56.700> spikes<00:03:57.030> on<00:03:57.270> the<00:03:57.360> end<00:03:57.540> you<00:03:57.810> will<00:03:57.930> actually

00:03:58.340 --> 00:03:58.350 
the spikes on the end you will actually

00:03:58.350 --> 00:03:59.540 
the spikes on the end you will actually
see<00:03:58.500> that<00:03:58.530> there<00:03:58.800> is<00:03:58.830> definitely<00:03:59.370> two

00:03:59.540 --> 00:03:59.550 
see that there is definitely two

00:03:59.550 --> 00:04:00.650 
see that there is definitely two
different<00:03:59.580> spikes<00:04:00.150> so<00:04:00.240> it's<00:04:00.360> a<00:04:00.420> slight

00:04:00.650 --> 00:04:00.660 
different spikes so it's a slight

00:04:00.660 --> 00:04:02.480 
different spikes so it's a slight
discoloration<00:04:00.990> where<00:04:01.530> the<00:04:01.650> red<00:04:01.830> light<00:04:02.070> is

00:04:02.480 --> 00:04:02.490 
discoloration where the red light is

00:04:02.490 --> 00:04:03.920 
discoloration where the red light is
hitting<00:04:02.910> the<00:04:03.030> two<00:04:03.209> different<00:04:03.510> fingers<00:04:03.810> and

00:04:03.920 --> 00:04:03.930 
hitting the two different fingers and

00:04:03.930 --> 00:04:05.150 
hitting the two different fingers and
you<00:04:03.990> can<00:04:04.110> definitely<00:04:04.260> see<00:04:04.620> there's<00:04:05.100> a

00:04:05.150 --> 00:04:05.160 
you can definitely see there's a

00:04:05.160 --> 00:04:07.010 
you can definitely see there's a
separation<00:04:05.640> because<00:04:06.090> the<00:04:06.240> spike<00:04:06.630> on<00:04:06.840> the<00:04:06.900> end

00:04:07.010 --> 00:04:07.020 
separation because the spike on the end

00:04:07.020 --> 00:04:08.480 
separation because the spike on the end
of<00:04:07.230> one<00:04:07.410> seems<00:04:07.650> to<00:04:07.800> end<00:04:07.920> and<00:04:08.190> you<00:04:08.220> can<00:04:08.370> see

00:04:08.480 --> 00:04:08.490 
of one seems to end and you can see

00:04:08.490 --> 00:04:09.920 
of one seems to end and you can see
where<00:04:08.640> the<00:04:08.700> other<00:04:08.880> one<00:04:09.090> starts<00:04:09.570> because<00:04:09.840> of

00:04:09.920 --> 00:04:09.930 
where the other one starts because of

00:04:09.930 --> 00:04:11.990 
where the other one starts because of
the<00:04:10.020> dark<00:04:10.290> background<00:04:10.620> now<00:04:11.280> the<00:04:11.340> second<00:04:11.880> point

00:04:11.990 --> 00:04:12.000 
the dark background now the second point

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:13.729 
the dark background now the second point
is<00:04:12.180> actually<00:04:12.300> looking<00:04:12.750> at<00:04:12.870> the<00:04:12.930> finger<00:04:13.320> itself

00:04:13.729 --> 00:04:13.739 
is actually looking at the finger itself

00:04:13.739 --> 00:04:15.500 
is actually looking at the finger itself
now<00:04:13.920> if<00:04:14.070> you<00:04:14.160> look<00:04:14.310> at<00:04:14.489> the<00:04:14.610> grooves<00:04:15.000> on<00:04:15.300> the

00:04:15.500 --> 00:04:15.510 
now if you look at the grooves on the

00:04:15.510 --> 00:04:17.390 
now if you look at the grooves on the
hand<00:04:15.720> where<00:04:15.959> the<00:04:16.500> fourth<00:04:16.739> finger<00:04:17.010> actually<00:04:17.130> is

00:04:17.390 --> 00:04:17.400 
hand where the fourth finger actually is

00:04:17.400 --> 00:04:18.470 
hand where the fourth finger actually is
you'll<00:04:17.549> see<00:04:17.669> that<00:04:17.820> light<00:04:18.030> is<00:04:18.239> definitely

00:04:18.470 --> 00:04:18.480 
you'll see that light is definitely

00:04:18.480 --> 00:04:20.150 
you'll see that light is definitely
casting<00:04:19.109> off<00:04:19.230> of<00:04:19.350> it<00:04:19.470> and<00:04:19.590> there's<00:04:20.070> definitely

00:04:20.150 --> 00:04:20.160 
casting off of it and there's definitely

00:04:20.160 --> 00:04:21.890 
casting off of it and there's definitely
some<00:04:20.549> ambient<00:04:20.970> occlusion<00:04:21.150> being<00:04:21.660> cast

00:04:21.890 --> 00:04:21.900 
some ambient occlusion being cast

00:04:21.900 --> 00:04:23.540 
some ambient occlusion being cast
between<00:04:22.109> the<00:04:22.470> little<00:04:22.590> finger<00:04:23.010> and<00:04:23.100> the<00:04:23.520> ring

00:04:23.540 --> 00:04:23.550 
between the little finger and the ring

00:04:23.550 --> 00:04:25.850 
between the little finger and the ring
finger<00:04:23.729> this<00:04:24.270> definitely<00:04:24.750> a<00:04:24.840> signifies<00:04:25.830> that

00:04:25.850 --> 00:04:25.860 
finger this definitely a signifies that

00:04:25.860 --> 00:04:27.590 
finger this definitely a signifies that
there<00:04:26.190> is<00:04:26.310> some<00:04:26.460> spacing<00:04:27.060> between

00:04:27.590 --> 00:04:27.600 
there is some spacing between

00:04:27.600 --> 00:04:29.300 
there is some spacing between
-<00:04:27.810> there's<00:04:28.020> some<00:04:28.200> depth<00:04:28.440> between<00:04:28.860> those<00:04:29.070> two

00:04:29.300 --> 00:04:29.310 
- there's some depth between those two

00:04:29.310 --> 00:04:31.040 
- there's some depth between those two
and<00:04:29.550> there's<00:04:29.940> most<00:04:30.180> certainly<00:04:30.660> another

00:04:31.040 --> 00:04:31.050 
and there's most certainly another
