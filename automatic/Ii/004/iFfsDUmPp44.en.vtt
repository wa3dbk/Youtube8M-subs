00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:34.000 
off inches and that's the sort of
general<00:00:29.010> arrangement<00:00:30.949> of<00:00:31.949> the<00:00:32.130> clinker<00:00:32.610> hole

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:04.470 
joint here for extra strength and with

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:07.370 
joint here for extra strength and with
the<00:01:04.559> transom<00:01:05.070> end<00:01:05.280> here<00:01:05.930> we've<00:01:06.930> got<00:01:07.140> the

the transom end here we've got the

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:10.490 
the transom end here we've got the
transom<00:01:08.220> knee<00:01:08.400> joint<00:01:08.760> here<00:01:09.090> as<00:01:09.900> you<00:01:10.080> can<00:01:10.260> see

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:10.500 
transom knee joint here as you can see

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:11.570 
transom knee joint here as you can see
from<00:01:10.710> the<00:01:10.890> plant

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:11.580 
from the plant

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:15.050 
from the plant
I've<00:01:12.030> been<00:01:12.210> large<00:01:12.450> slightly<00:01:13.170> -<00:01:13.820> it's<00:01:14.820> a<00:01:14.909> bit

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:15.060 
I've been large slightly - it's a bit

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:20.890 
I've been large slightly - it's a bit
more<00:01:15.619> strength<00:01:16.619> and<00:01:18.110> if<00:01:19.110> we<00:01:19.320> go<00:01:19.500> over<00:01:19.530> here<00:01:19.830> yes

00:01:20.890 --> 00:01:20.900 
more strength and if we go over here yes

00:01:20.900 --> 00:01:29.020 
more strength and if we go over here yes
this<00:01:21.900> is<00:01:22.140> the<00:01:23.750> that's<00:01:24.750> the<00:01:24.900> billboard<00:01:26.360> for<00:01:27.360> it

00:01:29.020 --> 00:01:29.030 
this is the that's the billboard for it

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:35.640 
this is the that's the billboard for it
just<00:01:30.030> go<00:01:30.329> in<00:01:31.520> using

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:35.650 

00:01:35.650 --> 00:01:40.440 

you<00:01:36.460> see<00:01:36.610> that<00:01:36.760> very<00:01:37.000> well<00:01:37.240> but<00:01:39.270> there's<00:01:40.270> the

00:01:40.440 --> 00:01:40.450 
you see that very well but there's the

00:01:40.450 --> 00:01:47.760 
you see that very well but there's the
stem<00:01:40.780> key<00:01:41.290> joint<00:01:41.650> there<00:01:43.140> the<00:01:44.140> apron<00:01:45.510> and<00:01:46.770> here

00:01:47.760 --> 00:01:47.770 
stem key joint there the apron and here

00:01:47.770 --> 00:01:52.850 
stem key joint there the apron and here
we<00:01:48.010> have

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:52.860 

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:57.140 

the<00:01:53.310> transom<00:01:53.910> knee<00:01:54.660> with<00:01:55.590> the<00:01:55.620> two<00:01:56.010> pegs<00:01:56.820> in

00:01:57.140 --> 00:01:57.150 
the transom knee with the two pegs in

00:01:57.150 --> 00:01:59.240 
the transom knee with the two pegs in
what<00:01:57.900> I've<00:01:58.020> done<00:01:58.200> is<00:01:58.350> I've<00:01:58.530> made<00:01:58.560> that<00:01:58.890> thicker

00:01:59.240 --> 00:01:59.250 
what I've done is I've made that thicker

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:01.610 
what I've done is I've made that thicker
and<00:01:59.520> stronger<00:01:59.880> by<00:02:00.360> using<00:02:00.600> the<00:02:00.990> wood<00:02:01.380> that's

00:02:01.610 --> 00:02:01.620 
and stronger by using the wood that's

00:02:01.620 --> 00:02:03.730 
and stronger by using the wood that's
over<00:02:01.890> hundred<00:02:02.160> years<00:02:02.370> obly<00:02:02.760> they're<00:02:02.910> not<00:02:03.090> and

00:02:03.730 --> 00:02:03.740 
over hundred years obly they're not and

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:06.680 
over hundred years obly they're not and
they're<00:02:04.740> ash<00:02:05.070> pins<00:02:05.520> that<00:02:05.850> I've<00:02:06.030> used<00:02:06.330> which

00:02:06.680 --> 00:02:06.690 
they're ash pins that I've used which

00:02:06.690 --> 00:02:09.650 
they're ash pins that I've used which
are<00:02:06.870> about<00:02:07.110> five<00:02:07.470> and<00:02:07.590> a<00:02:07.680> half<00:02:07.850> mil<00:02:08.850> diameter

00:02:09.650 --> 00:02:09.660 
are about five and a half mil diameter

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:12.860 
are about five and a half mil diameter
they<00:02:10.500> epoxy<00:02:11.100> dimmed<00:02:11.310> and<00:02:11.880> it<00:02:12.300> gives<00:02:12.510> extra

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:12.870 
they epoxy dimmed and it gives extra

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:18.680 
they epoxy dimmed and it gives extra
strength<00:02:13.580> to<00:02:14.840> the<00:02:15.840> transom<00:02:17.180> this<00:02:18.180> is<00:02:18.300> a<00:02:18.420> nice

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:18.690 
strength to the transom this is a nice

00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:20.840 
strength to the transom this is a nice
piece<00:02:19.020> so<00:02:19.320> they'll<00:02:19.770> piece<00:02:20.010> of<00:02:20.190> wood<00:02:20.340> here<00:02:20.580> to

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:20.850 
piece so they'll piece of wood here to

00:02:20.850 --> 00:02:22.570 
piece so they'll piece of wood here to
get<00:02:21.030> it<00:02:21.180> centered<00:02:21.420> to<00:02:21.840> the<00:02:21.870> centreline

00:02:22.570 --> 00:02:22.580 
get it centered to the centreline

00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:24.980 
get it centered to the centreline
because<00:02:23.580> it<00:02:23.760> does<00:02:23.970> weigh<00:02:24.180> them<00:02:24.480> out<00:02:24.660> a<00:02:24.690> little

00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:24.990 
because it does weigh them out a little

00:02:24.990 --> 00:02:28.640 
because it does weigh them out a little
bit<00:02:25.290> so<00:02:26.100> if<00:02:26.250> you<00:02:26.370> if<00:02:26.730> you<00:02:26.850> just<00:02:27.230> see<00:02:28.230> a<00:02:28.260> glue

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:28.650 
bit so if you if you just see a glue

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:31.220 
bit so if you if you just see a glue
that<00:02:28.680> in<00:02:29.160> it<00:02:30.000> just<00:02:30.270> gives<00:02:30.570> it<00:02:30.660> a<00:02:30.810> fixed

00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:31.230 
that in it just gives it a fixed

00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:33.710 
that in it just gives it a fixed
position<00:02:31.950> point<00:02:32.580> and<00:02:32.820> it<00:02:32.910> won't<00:02:33.090> move<00:02:33.360> when

00:02:33.710 --> 00:02:33.720 
position point and it won't move when

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:40.790 
position point and it won't move when
you're<00:02:33.930> building<00:02:37.670> also<00:02:38.670> here<00:02:39.530> you'll<00:02:40.530> see

00:02:40.790 --> 00:02:40.800 
you're building also here you'll see

00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:44.980 
you're building also here you'll see
that<00:02:41.510> each<00:02:42.510> station<00:02:42.930> is<00:02:43.290> marked<00:02:43.710> out<00:02:43.950> where

00:02:44.980 --> 00:02:44.990 
that each station is marked out where

00:02:44.990 --> 00:02:53.330 
that each station is marked out where
the<00:02:45.990> planks<00:02:46.530> will<00:02:47.100> go<00:02:49.220> okay<00:02:50.690> and<00:02:52.070> then<00:02:53.070> what

00:02:53.330 --> 00:02:53.340 
the planks will go okay and then what

00:02:53.340 --> 00:02:58.100 
the planks will go okay and then what
I've<00:02:53.520> done<00:02:53.820> is<00:02:55.700> on<00:02:56.700> a<00:02:56.760> whore<00:02:57.450> Denari<00:02:57.660> piece<00:02:57.870> of

00:02:58.100 --> 00:02:58.110 
I've done is on a whore Denari piece of

00:02:58.110 --> 00:03:04.910 
I've done is on a whore Denari piece of
wood<00:02:59.030> I've<00:03:00.030> used<00:03:03.020> you<00:03:04.020> can<00:03:04.230> see<00:03:04.500> that<00:03:04.739> I've

00:03:04.910 --> 00:03:04.920 
wood I've used you can see that I've

00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:08.170 
wood I've used you can see that I've
used<00:03:05.100> markers

00:03:08.170 --> 00:03:08.180 

00:03:08.180 --> 00:03:11.710 

-<00:03:08.659> give<00:03:08.840> me<00:03:08.870> a<00:03:09.080> length<00:03:09.409> of<00:03:09.739> where<00:03:10.720> the

00:03:11.710 --> 00:03:11.720 
- give me a length of where the

00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:13.539 
- give me a length of where the
station's<00:03:12.319> going<00:03:12.650> to<00:03:12.830> go<00:03:13.040> for<00:03:13.340> the<00:03:13.400> actual
