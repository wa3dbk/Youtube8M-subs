00:00:01.910 --> 00:00:11.250
 Michiyama is how to write the subject composition of high school entrance exam today 

00:00:07.640 --> 00:00:12.670
 I comment on this and say 

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:13.900
 Writing a task 

00:00:12.670 --> 00:00:14.960
 Oh dear 

00:00:13.900 --> 00:00:22.700
 How is it 

00:00:14.960 --> 00:00:27.820
 About half of things or things often come out at school or there is no part of the number or after school 

00:00:22.700 --> 00:00:33.770
 Well it depends on where you live and the school you will take 

00:00:27.820 --> 00:00:37.880
 If you do not Ika firmly suppress it because there are many Toka pretty important point it is also 

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:41.600
 As it is greatly limited by task composition 

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:48.530
 I will explain some points to avoid that 

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:52.890
 So what is the task composition and time and the number of characters and the theme are decided, the condition 

00:00:48.530 --> 00:00:59.430
 It is composition that writes along problem 

00:00:52.890 --> 00:01:04.710
 Specifically, what kind of thing is it, for example, at the Tokyo Olympics held in 2020 

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:08.510
 Summarize your opinion on what you can and what you can do in 400 characters or less 

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:14.990
 Such as time is 45 minutes Ekoyuu 

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:17.620
 Thematic problems will be issued, on the other hand you will have 40 minutes or 10 minutes or 45 minutes 

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:20.860
 I have to put together a document 

00:01:17.620 --> 00:01:27.850
 This is the task composition 

00:01:20.860 --> 00:01:32.439
 It is a big mistake to in, but I'm quite often foot worth very weak child say this weak 

00:01:27.850 --> 00:01:38.920
 That my many poor How about if available good to Fu say selfishly consultation I come to save 

00:01:32.439 --> 00:01:40.730
 I I I Is there basically this who said several times challenges writing to you now to the child 

00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:48.070
 If you return the question 

00:01:40.730 --> 00:01:54.159
 You will receive a reply that most of the children have never been there or the first floor is on the third floor 

00:01:48.070 --> 00:02:00.850
 There is no way I can do it from the beginning because I do not do well in school even in the first place 

00:01:54.159 --> 00:02:02.409
 In other words, you can only do it because you don't practice it and anyone can do it 

00:02:00.850 --> 00:02:08.229
 if 

00:02:02.409 --> 00:02:13.510
 If you write the task composition 30 times but you still can not do something, then something is wrong but basically 

00:02:08.229 --> 00:02:15.280
 Please be assured that anyone who can solve the problem about 30 times will be able to do it. 

00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:21.790
 To what kind of wind 

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:22.810
 If you say that you can get a high score by polishing, you must first be consciously divided into 3 stages 

00:02:21.790 --> 00:02:30.069
 It is 

00:02:22.810 --> 00:02:32.450
 Foreword Text Conclusion If you divide the text into these three parts, it will become quite persuasive text 

00:02:30.069 --> 00:02:33.380
 I will 

00:02:32.450 --> 00:02:39.440
 so 

00:02:33.380 --> 00:02:41.300
 My God Another important is divided into um 3 stage's gonna put a thought to the conclusion 

00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:45.980
 Everyone does that 

00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:52.640
 Since all that is already written in three gorrows, anyone can do it 

00:02:45.980 --> 00:02:53.400
 So message here where the term or to an evaluation and conclusion last thoughts 

00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:58.620
 Tightly 

00:02:53.400 --> 00:03:04.230
 I'm going to put a good point still packed high Say in the example of the previous Tokyo Olympics 

00:02:58.620 --> 00:03:08.200
 Once If this you talk about hot to be able to at the Tokyo Olympic Games this Re has to last 

00:03:04.230 --> 00:03:11.739
 The score will increase considerably 

00:03:08.200 --> 00:03:14.099
 Well besides that to put the various air and Kaato is 

00:03:11.739 --> 00:03:14.099
 Well then 

00:03:14.460 --> 00:03:20.940
 Good to Toka seems such a Once written in the body Toka preface and selfishness more what the wind 

00:03:19.410 --> 00:03:27.060
 about 

00:03:20.940 --> 00:03:31.440
 As it is summarized on official site, if it is good, in the part of the comment column under this animation 

00:03:27.060 --> 00:03:33.200

00:03:31.440 --> 00:03:37.190

00:03:37.190 --> 00:03:47.740
 E-mail course that summarizes the important thing in the success of high school exam
