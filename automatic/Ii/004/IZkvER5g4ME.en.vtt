this in my loaf pan and I'm going to put
it<00:03:17.329> in<00:03:17.450> my<00:03:17.540> oven<00:03:17.900> and<00:03:18.860> this<00:03:19.220> will<00:03:19.430> have<00:03:19.579> to<00:03:19.700> cook

00:03:19.899 --> 00:03:19.909 
it in my oven and this will have to cook

00:03:19.909 --> 00:03:22.929 
it in my oven and this will have to cook
for<00:03:19.939> fifty<00:03:20.780> five<00:03:20.989> to<00:03:21.379> sixty<00:03:21.769> five<00:03:22.340> minutes

00:03:22.929 --> 00:03:22.939 
for fifty five to sixty five minutes

00:03:22.939 --> 00:03:25.600 
for fifty five to sixty five minutes
now<00:03:23.720> if<00:03:24.019> the<00:03:24.230> you're<00:03:24.650> gonna<00:03:24.829> want<00:03:25.099> to<00:03:25.159> check<00:03:25.220> it

00:03:25.600 --> 00:03:25.610 
now if the you're gonna want to check it

00:03:25.610 --> 00:03:27.780 
now if the you're gonna want to check it
because<00:03:25.970> if<00:03:26.120> the<00:03:26.239> brand<00:03:26.480> top<00:03:26.989> starts<00:03:27.379> to<00:03:27.500> brown

00:03:27.780 --> 00:03:27.790 
because if the brand top starts to brown

00:03:27.790 --> 00:03:30.399 
because if the brand top starts to brown
too<00:03:28.790> much<00:03:29.000> you'll<00:03:29.629> want<00:03:29.810> to<00:03:29.870> cover<00:03:30.049> it<00:03:30.290> with

00:03:30.399 --> 00:03:30.409 
too much you'll want to cover it with

00:03:30.409 --> 00:03:33.399 
too much you'll want to cover it with
foil<00:03:30.709> and<00:03:31.069> that<00:03:32.030> will<00:03:32.180> keep<00:03:32.329> it<00:03:32.510> from<00:03:32.750> getting

00:03:33.399 --> 00:03:33.409 
foil and that will keep it from getting

00:03:33.409 --> 00:03:52.760 
foil and that will keep it from getting
too<00:03:33.590> brown<00:03:33.920> on<00:03:34.040> the<00:03:34.129> top

00:04:47.350 --> 00:04:49.020 
what I'm gonna do now is glaze it before
I<00:04:47.380> make<00:04:47.590> the<00:04:47.740> glaze<00:04:47.919> I'm<00:04:48.220> gonna<00:04:48.340> take<00:04:48.580> a<00:04:48.610> skewer

00:04:51.250 --> 00:04:53.850 
and I'm just gonna poke holes in it and
this<00:04:51.430> will<00:04:51.700> allow<00:04:51.850> the<00:04:52.810> glaze<00:04:53.050> to<00:04:53.350> penetrate

the<00:04:54.669> bread<00:04:54.910> you<00:04:55.300> don't<00:04:55.479> have<00:04:55.660> to<00:04:55.810> do<00:04:55.960> this<00:04:56.140> I

00:04:56.370 --> 00:04:56.380

00:04:56.380 --> 00:04:58.770 
the bread you don't have to do this I
just<00:04:56.650> think<00:04:57.460> it<00:04:57.580> would<00:04:57.729> add<00:04:58.510> a<00:04:58.570> little

00:04:58.770 --> 00:04:58.780 
just think it would add a little

00:04:58.780 --> 00:05:01.290 
just think it would add a little
something<00:04:59.290> to<00:04:59.320> it<00:04:59.620> if<00:04:59.740> we<00:04:59.890> had<00:05:00.070> the<00:05:00.190> glaze<00:05:00.430> go

00:05:01.290 --> 00:05:01.300 
something to it if we had the glaze go

00:05:01.300 --> 00:05:04.560 
something to it if we had the glaze go
down<00:05:01.479> into<00:05:01.690> the<00:05:01.900> bread<00:05:02.110> we're<00:05:02.860> gonna<00:05:02.979> just<00:05:03.570> do

00:05:04.560 --> 00:05:04.570 
down into the bread we're gonna just do

00:05:04.570 --> 00:05:06.469
