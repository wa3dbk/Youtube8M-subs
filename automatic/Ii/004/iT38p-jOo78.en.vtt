00:01:57.890 --> 00:01:57.900 

00:01:57.900 --> 00:02:00.990 

that<00:01:58.900> was<00:01:59.110> all<00:01:59.320> done<00:01:59.680> in<00:01:59.729> Windows<00:02:00.729> Movie<00:02:00.850> Maker

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:01.000

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:03.660 
that was all done in Windows Movie Maker
as<00:02:01.420> I<00:02:01.570> pointed<00:02:01.869> out<00:02:01.960> earlier<00:02:02.110> I<00:02:02.530> did<00:02:03.159> not<00:02:03.310> do<00:02:03.520> as

00:02:03.660 --> 00:02:03.670 
as I pointed out earlier I did not do as

00:02:03.670 --> 00:02:05.760 
as I pointed out earlier I did not do as
any<00:02:03.880> editing<00:02:04.510> techniques<00:02:05.020> without<00:02:05.170> all<00:02:05.560> I<00:02:05.619> did

00:02:05.760 --> 00:02:05.770 
any editing techniques without all I did

00:02:05.770 --> 00:02:07.859 
any editing techniques without all I did
was<00:02:05.860> shift<00:02:06.220> over<00:02:06.460> the<00:02:06.580> soundtrack<00:02:07.180> of<00:02:07.420> the

movie<00:02:11.110> maker<00:02:11.140> and<00:02:11.650> it's<00:02:12.550> that's<00:02:12.819> exactly

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:13.510 
movie maker and it's that's exactly

00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:14.940 
movie maker and it's that's exactly
would<00:02:13.750> it<00:02:13.840> sound<00:02:13.989> what<00:02:14.260> it<00:02:14.410> sounded<00:02:14.620> like<00:02:14.650> when

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:14.950 
would it sound what it sounded like when

00:02:14.950 --> 00:02:16.860 
would it sound what it sounded like when
I<00:02:14.980> heard<00:02:15.190> it<00:02:15.400> yeah<00:02:16.180> the<00:02:16.300> harmony<00:02:16.630> is<00:02:16.720> not

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:16.870 
I heard it yeah the harmony is not

00:02:16.870 --> 00:02:20.370 
I heard it yeah the harmony is not
spot-on<00:02:17.230> in<00:02:17.709> points<00:02:18.220> but<00:02:19.209> that<00:02:20.170> is<00:02:20.350> the

00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:20.380 
spot-on in points but that is the

00:02:20.380 --> 00:02:22.199 
spot-on in points but that is the
closest<00:02:20.890> approximation<00:02:21.069> I<00:02:21.550> could<00:02:21.700> get<00:02:21.880> to

00:02:22.199 --> 00:02:22.209 
closest approximation I could get to

00:02:22.209 --> 00:02:23.520 
closest approximation I could get to
when<00:02:22.390> I<00:02:22.420> heard<00:02:22.600> it<00:02:22.750> you<00:02:22.810> have<00:02:22.959> to<00:02:23.080> understand

00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:23.530 
when I heard it you have to understand

00:02:23.530 --> 00:02:25.050 
when I heard it you have to understand
when<00:02:23.680> I<00:02:23.709> heard<00:02:23.890> this<00:02:24.010> it<00:02:24.220> was<00:02:24.370> an<00:02:24.580> exact

00:02:25.050 --> 00:02:25.060 
when I heard this it was an exact

00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:27.600 
when I heard this it was an exact
harmony<00:02:25.780> it<00:02:25.930> sounded<00:02:26.319> let<00:02:26.410> the<00:02:26.500> duet<00:02:26.830> it<00:02:27.430> was

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:27.610 
harmony it sounded let the duet it was

00:02:27.610 --> 00:02:29.280 
harmony it sounded let the duet it was
incredible<00:02:28.090> actually<00:02:28.959> I<00:02:28.989> think<00:02:29.019> that

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:29.290 
incredible actually I think that

00:02:29.290 --> 00:02:31.560 
incredible actually I think that
instrument<00:02:29.739> is<00:02:29.800> an<00:02:29.890> English<00:02:30.190> horn<00:02:30.790> playing<00:02:31.480> in

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:31.570 
instrument is an English horn playing in

00:02:31.570 --> 00:02:33.300 
instrument is an English horn playing in
the<00:02:31.660> lower<00:02:31.810> register<00:02:32.350> I<00:02:32.560> would<00:02:32.860> know<00:02:33.010> I've

00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:33.310 
the lower register I would know I've

00:02:33.310 --> 00:02:34.830 
the lower register I would know I've
played<00:02:33.640> double<00:02:33.910> reed<00:02:34.060> for<00:02:34.330> eight<00:02:34.540> years<00:02:34.690> now

00:02:34.830 --> 00:02:34.840 
played double reed for eight years now

00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:37.110

but if anybody knows for sure please let
me<00:02:37.239> know<00:02:37.269> but<00:02:37.989> I<00:02:38.019> just<00:02:38.230> thought<00:02:38.290> that<00:02:38.350> was<00:02:38.500> kind

00:02:38.699 --> 00:02:38.709 
me know but I just thought that was kind

00:02:38.709 --> 00:02:40.050 
me know but I just thought that was kind
of<00:02:38.800> interesting<00:02:38.950> and<00:02:39.580> you<00:02:39.640> might<00:02:39.790> want<00:02:39.910> to

00:02:40.050 --> 00:02:40.060 
of interesting and you might want to

00:02:40.060 --> 00:02:41.820 
of interesting and you might want to
hear<00:02:40.269> that<00:02:40.480> I'm<00:02:40.810> always<00:02:41.050> amazed<00:02:41.380> at<00:02:41.650> how<00:02:41.769> we

00:02:41.820 --> 00:02:41.830 
hear that I'm always amazed at how we

00:02:41.830 --> 00:02:43.530 
hear that I'm always amazed at how we
can<00:02:41.890> find<00:02:42.100> music<00:02:42.580> in<00:02:42.760> the<00:02:42.850> most<00:02:43.000> unlikely<00:02:43.209> of

00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:43.540 
can find music in the most unlikely of

00:02:43.540 --> 00:02:46.500 
can find music in the most unlikely of
places<00:02:44.400> so<00:02:45.400> while<00:02:45.730> I<00:02:45.760> tell<00:02:46.090> them<00:02:46.180> this<00:02:46.330> is<00:02:46.450> the

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:46.510 
places so while I tell them this is the

00:02:46.510 --> 00:02:48.150 
places so while I tell them this is the
Phantom<00:02:46.810> safety<00:02:47.080> pin<00:02:47.260> I<00:02:47.470> will<00:02:47.860> see<00:02:48.040> you<00:02:48.070> later
