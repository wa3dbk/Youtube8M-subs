00:00:02.090 --> 00:00:02.100 
the scanner systems that were put in

00:00:02.100 --> 00:00:04.510 
the scanner systems that were put in
place<00:00:02.310> in<00:00:02.340> the<00:00:02.580> airports<00:00:02.970> after<00:00:03.389> the<00:00:03.689> one

terrorist tried to ignite his underpants
in<00:00:07.980> december<00:00:08.820> of<00:00:08.849> last<00:00:08.940> year<00:00:09.950> when<00:00:10.950> they<00:00:11.070> would

00:00:11.180 --> 00:00:11.190 
in december of last year when they would

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:14.270 
in december of last year when they would
scan<00:00:11.490> people<00:00:11.849> they<00:00:11.969> would<00:00:12.120> show<00:00:12.469> the<00:00:13.469> images

00:00:14.270 --> 00:00:14.280 
scan people they would show the images

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:15.230 
scan people they would show the images
that<00:00:14.309> came<00:00:14.519> up<00:00:14.580> were<00:00:14.790> pretty<00:00:15.030> revealing

00:00:15.230 --> 00:00:15.240 
that came up were pretty revealing

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:18.260 
that came up were pretty revealing
images<00:00:15.809> but<00:00:16.199> usually<00:00:16.619> they<00:00:16.800> were<00:00:16.859> the<00:00:17.820> TSA

00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:18.270 
images but usually they were the TSA

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:20.420 
images but usually they were the TSA
workers<00:00:18.300> were<00:00:18.720> in<00:00:18.869> other<00:00:19.080> rooms<00:00:19.410> that<00:00:20.310> were

00:00:20.420 --> 00:00:20.430 
workers were in other rooms that were

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:21.980 
workers were in other rooms that were
totally<00:00:20.820> separate<00:00:21.150> from<00:00:21.210> the<00:00:21.390> public<00:00:21.720> so<00:00:21.869> they

00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:21.990 
totally separate from the public so they

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:24.439 
totally separate from the public so they
can<00:00:22.170> see<00:00:22.410> him<00:00:22.500> and<00:00:22.980> they<00:00:23.430> would<00:00:23.609> scan<00:00:24.060> people

00:00:24.439 --> 00:00:24.449 
can see him and they would scan people

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:25.849 
can see him and they would scan people
so<00:00:24.660> that<00:00:24.689> they<00:00:24.869> could<00:00:25.080> see<00:00:25.289> whether<00:00:25.560> or<00:00:25.710> not

00:00:25.849 --> 00:00:25.859 
so that they could see whether or not

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:28.700 
so that they could see whether or not
they<00:00:26.130> had<00:00:26.369> any<00:00:26.730> type<00:00:27.420> of<00:00:27.449> explosive<00:00:28.080> on<00:00:28.439> them

00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:28.710 
they had any type of explosive on them

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:31.009 
they had any type of explosive on them
or<00:00:29.010> anything<00:00:29.220> they<00:00:29.429> need<00:00:29.609> to<00:00:29.730> check<00:00:29.970> out<00:00:30.119> and

00:00:31.009 --> 00:00:31.019 
or anything they need to check out and

it shows parts of the body whether they

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:11.359 
it shows parts of the body whether they
think<00:01:08.939> that<00:01:09.470> areas<00:01:10.470> that<00:01:10.680> need<00:01:10.860> to<00:01:11.010> be<00:01:11.040> further

00:01:11.359 --> 00:01:11.369 
think that areas that need to be further

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:12.890 
think that areas that need to be further
checked<00:01:11.729> and<00:01:11.939> they<00:01:12.000> need<00:01:12.180> to<00:01:12.210> be<00:01:12.299> patted<00:01:12.750> down

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:12.900 
checked and they need to be patted down

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:15.249 
checked and they need to be patted down
yes<00:01:13.260> you<00:01:13.439> could<00:01:13.560> say<00:01:13.590> yeah<00:01:14.220> and<00:01:14.520> it's<00:01:14.790> you<00:01:15.000> know

00:01:15.249 --> 00:01:15.259 
yes you could say yeah and it's you know

00:01:15.259 --> 00:01:18.410 
yes you could say yeah and it's you know
this<00:01:16.259> is<00:01:16.290> this<00:01:16.619> is<00:01:16.830> big<00:01:17.040> i<00:01:17.189> think<00:01:17.460> as<00:01:17.640> these

00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:18.420 
this is this is big i think as these

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:21.260 
this is this is big i think as these
scanners<00:01:18.780> begin<00:01:19.320> to<00:01:19.500> be<00:01:19.619> more<00:01:20.189> and<00:01:20.369> more<00:01:20.460> more

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:21.270 
scanners begin to be more and more more

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:22.429 
scanners begin to be more and more more
and<00:01:21.330> more<00:01:21.540> of<00:01:21.570> them<00:01:21.780> are<00:01:21.869> put<00:01:22.020> into<00:01:22.140> place

00:01:22.429 --> 00:01:22.439 
and more of them are put into place

00:01:22.439 --> 00:01:26.899 
and more of them are put into place
across<00:01:22.770> the<00:01:23.009> nation<00:01:23.390> that<00:01:24.390> these<00:01:25.909> invasive

00:01:26.899 --> 00:01:26.909 
across the nation that these invasive

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:29.260 
across the nation that these invasive
privacy<00:01:27.479> concerns<00:01:27.930> were<00:01:28.290> definitely

00:01:29.260 --> 00:01:29.270 
privacy concerns were definitely

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:32.780 
privacy concerns were definitely
legitimate<00:01:30.270> issues<00:01:30.630> and<00:01:31.790> apparently

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:32.790 
legitimate issues and apparently

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:35.840 
legitimate issues and apparently
passengers<00:01:33.360> have<00:01:33.570> the<00:01:33.720> choice<00:01:34.020> to<00:01:34.850> get

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:35.850 
passengers have the choice to get

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:37.910 
passengers have the choice to get
scanned<00:01:36.270> or<00:01:36.479> not<00:01:36.630> but<00:01:37.200> if<00:01:37.290> they<00:01:37.470> don't<00:01:37.740> get

00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:37.920 
scanned or not but if they don't get

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:41.179 
scanned or not but if they don't get
these<00:01:38.130> body<00:01:38.369> scans<00:01:38.820> they<00:01:39.720> could<00:01:40.710> potentially

00:01:41.179 --> 00:01:41.189 
these body scans they could potentially

00:01:41.189 --> 00:01:43.130 
these body scans they could potentially
be<00:01:41.310> patted<00:01:41.670> down<00:01:41.820> right<00:01:42.360> just<00:01:42.570> like<00:01:42.720> if<00:01:42.869> you<00:01:42.960> do

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:43.140 
be patted down right just like if you do

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:44.300 
be patted down right just like if you do
go<00:01:43.320> through<00:01:43.350> body<00:01:43.680> skin<00:01:43.920> and<00:01:44.040> they<00:01:44.100> find

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:44.310 
go through body skin and they find

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:45.289 
go through body skin and they find
something<00:01:44.490> you<00:01:44.670> could<00:01:44.790> potentially<00:01:44.880> be

00:01:45.289 --> 00:01:45.299 
something you could potentially be

00:01:45.299 --> 00:01:47.569 
something you could potentially be
patted<00:01:45.570> down<00:01:46.009> apparently<00:01:47.009> ninety-eight

00:01:47.569 --> 00:01:47.579 
patted down apparently ninety-eight

00:01:47.579 --> 00:01:51.020 
patted down apparently ninety-eight
percent<00:01:47.820> of<00:01:48.299> people<00:01:49.340> who<00:01:50.340> have<00:01:50.520> the<00:01:50.549> choice

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:51.030 
percent of people who have the choice

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:53.810 
percent of people who have the choice
choose<00:01:51.659> the<00:01:51.840> body<00:01:52.049> scanners<00:01:52.500> because<00:01:53.220> they

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:53.820 
choose the body scanners because they

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:55.760 
choose the body scanners because they
have<00:01:53.939> nothing<00:01:54.090> to<00:01:54.240> hide<00:01:54.450> and<00:01:54.509> it's<00:01:55.170> quicker

00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:55.770 
have nothing to hide and it's quicker

00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:58.789 
have nothing to hide and it's quicker
right<00:01:56.729> so<00:01:57.479> i<00:01:57.509> think<00:01:57.840> that<00:01:58.110> this<00:01:58.380> is<00:01:58.560> good<00:01:58.770> this

00:01:58.789 --> 00:01:58.799 
right so i think that this is good this

00:01:58.799 --> 00:02:01.730 
right so i think that this is good this
is<00:01:58.979> a<00:01:59.100> good<00:01:59.430> compromise<00:02:00.090> in<00:02:00.630> my<00:02:00.780> opinion<00:02:01.110> some

00:02:01.730 --> 00:02:01.740 
is a good compromise in my opinion some

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:04.219 
is a good compromise in my opinion some
people<00:02:01.979> are<00:02:02.100> still<00:02:02.280> concerned<00:02:02.670> because<00:02:03.299> they

00:02:04.219 --> 00:02:04.229 
people are still concerned because they

00:02:04.229 --> 00:02:06.679 
people are still concerned because they
could<00:02:04.380> still<00:02:04.619> potentially<00:02:04.829> take<00:02:05.460> images<00:02:06.329> from

00:02:06.679 --> 00:02:06.689 
could still potentially take images from

00:02:06.689 --> 00:02:10.010 
could still potentially take images from
them<00:02:06.930> or<00:02:07.079> get<00:02:07.229> your<00:02:07.320> personal<00:02:07.799> data<00:02:08.009> i<00:02:09.020> think

00:02:10.010 --> 00:02:10.020 
them or get your personal data i think

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:13.220 
them or get your personal data i think
that's<00:02:10.140> a<00:02:10.319> little<00:02:10.500> a<00:02:11.209> little<00:02:12.209> paranoid<00:02:12.599> if<00:02:12.959> you

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:13.230 
that's a little a little paranoid if you

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:14.010 
that's a little a little paranoid if you
ask<00:02:13.379> me

00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:14.020 
ask me

00:02:14.020 --> 00:02:15.870
