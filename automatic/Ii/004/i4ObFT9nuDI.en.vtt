00:04:20.449 --> 00:04:20.459 
is so

00:04:20.459 --> 00:04:23.420

00:04:46.110 --> 00:04:48.559 
planting scenario i guess you can say is
basically<00:04:46.919> killing<00:04:47.160> the<00:04:47.340> guy<00:04:47.490> off<00:04:47.669> bomb<00:04:47.940> that

00:04:48.559 --> 00:04:48.569 
basically killing the guy off bomb that

00:04:48.569 --> 00:04:50.059 
basically killing the guy off bomb that
completely<00:04:49.020> stops<00:04:49.470> their<00:04:49.740> whole<00:04:49.949> entire

00:04:50.059 --> 00:04:50.069 
completely stops their whole entire

00:04:50.069 --> 00:04:53.330 
completely stops their whole entire
momentum<00:04:50.880> and<00:04:51.090> it's<00:04:52.080> really<00:04:52.650> important<00:04:53.099> to<00:04:53.160> do

00:04:53.330 --> 00:04:53.340 
momentum and it's really important to do

00:04:53.340 --> 00:04:55.310 
momentum and it's really important to do
so<00:04:53.580> when<00:04:53.759> you're<00:04:53.880> trying<00:04:54.030> to<00:04:54.180> break<00:04:54.389> a<00:04:54.419> site<00:04:54.750> so

00:04:55.310 --> 00:04:55.320 
so when you're trying to break a site so

00:04:55.320 --> 00:04:58.159 
so when you're trying to break a site so
i'm<00:04:55.979> pretty<00:04:56.639> sure<00:04:56.880> i<00:04:56.910> like<00:04:57.509> mentioned<00:04:58.020> this<00:04:58.110> in

00:04:58.159 --> 00:04:58.169 
i'm pretty sure i like mentioned this in

00:04:58.169 --> 00:05:00.020 
i'm pretty sure i like mentioned this in
the<00:04:58.410> first<00:04:58.650> edition<00:04:58.860> of<00:04:59.220> nate<00:04:59.430> spots<00:04:59.729> but<00:04:59.970> i

00:05:00.020 --> 00:05:00.030 
the first edition of nate spots but i

00:05:00.030 --> 00:05:02.240 
the first edition of nate spots but i
didn't<00:05:00.419> see<00:05:00.570> anyone<00:05:01.169> submit<00:05:01.620> clips<00:05:01.949> of<00:05:02.099> them

00:05:02.240 --> 00:05:02.250 
didn't see anyone submit clips of them

00:05:02.250 --> 00:05:05.150 
didn't see anyone submit clips of them
using<00:05:02.669> it<00:05:03.169> not<00:05:04.169> all<00:05:04.380> how<00:05:04.530> do<00:05:04.590> people<00:05:04.889> use<00:05:05.039> this

00:05:05.150 --> 00:05:05.160 
using it not all how do people use this

00:05:05.160 --> 00:05:07.610 
using it not all how do people use this
at<00:05:05.340> all<00:05:05.460> but<00:05:05.639> i<00:05:05.669> still<00:05:06.000> use<00:05:06.180> a<00:05:06.240> spike<00:05:06.630> just<00:05:07.320> so

00:05:07.610 --> 00:05:07.620 
at all but i still use a spike just so

00:05:07.620 --> 00:05:10.070 
at all but i still use a spike just so
often<00:05:08.160> is<00:05:08.550> almost<00:05:08.970> every<00:05:09.270> single<00:05:09.449> game<00:05:09.750> almost

00:05:10.070 --> 00:05:10.080 
often is almost every single game almost

00:05:10.080 --> 00:05:12.980 
often is almost every single game almost
every<00:05:10.440> single<00:05:10.590> defense<00:05:11.220> on<00:05:11.490> riot<00:05:11.820> so<00:05:12.479> you<00:05:12.960> just

00:05:12.980 --> 00:05:12.990 
every single defense on riot so you just

00:05:12.990 --> 00:05:14.749 
every single defense on riot so you just
run<00:05:13.320> up<00:05:13.470> right<00:05:13.680> over<00:05:13.710> here<00:05:14.070> this<00:05:14.220> very<00:05:14.430> last

00:05:14.749 --> 00:05:14.759 
run up right over here this very last

00:05:14.759 --> 00:05:17.120 
run up right over here this very last
column<00:05:15.240> and<00:05:15.449> then<00:05:15.930> you<00:05:16.050> just<00:05:16.169> look<00:05:16.800> straight

00:05:17.120 --> 00:05:17.130 
column and then you just look straight

00:05:17.130 --> 00:05:19.580 
column and then you just look straight
up<00:05:17.250> and<00:05:17.639> line<00:05:17.759> it<00:05:17.789> up<00:05:18.000> with<00:05:18.060> a<00:05:18.389> now<00:05:18.900> you<00:05:18.960> have<00:05:19.349> to

00:05:19.580 --> 00:05:19.590 
up and line it up with a now you have to

00:05:19.590 --> 00:05:22.100 
up and line it up with a now you have to
double<00:05:19.979> need<00:05:20.159> this<00:05:20.370> if<00:05:21.270> you<00:05:21.509> want<00:05:21.780> you<00:05:21.960> can

00:05:22.100 --> 00:05:22.110 
double need this if you want you can

00:05:22.110 --> 00:05:24.050 
double need this if you want you can
stun<00:05:22.500> it<00:05:22.530> or<00:05:22.830> you<00:05:22.979> can<00:05:23.190> throw<00:05:23.490> one<00:05:23.669> nate<00:05:23.880> just

00:05:24.050 --> 00:05:24.060 
stun it or you can throw one nate just

00:05:24.060 --> 00:05:25.939 
stun it or you can throw one nate just
to<00:05:24.270> see<00:05:24.449> if<00:05:24.509> they're<00:05:24.690> on<00:05:24.720> the<00:05:25.050> bomb<00:05:25.229> but<00:05:25.770> if<00:05:25.830> you

00:05:25.939 --> 00:05:25.949 
to see if they're on the bomb but if you

00:05:25.949 --> 00:05:27.649 
to see if they're on the bomb but if you
want<00:05:26.130> to<00:05:26.190> get<00:05:26.340> that<00:05:26.370> kill<00:05:26.789> and<00:05:27.090> kill<00:05:27.330> them<00:05:27.570> off

00:05:27.649 --> 00:05:27.659 
want to get that kill and kill them off

00:05:27.659 --> 00:05:29.899 
want to get that kill and kill them off
bomb<00:05:27.960> you're<00:05:28.590> pretty<00:05:29.070> much<00:05:29.130> you're<00:05:29.820> gonna

00:05:29.899 --> 00:05:29.909 
bomb you're pretty much you're gonna

00:05:29.909 --> 00:05:32.689 
bomb you're pretty much you're gonna
have<00:05:30.090> to<00:05:30.210> throw<00:05:30.360> two<00:05:30.630> needs<00:05:30.900> um<00:05:31.590> I<00:05:32.310> think<00:05:32.370> I

00:05:32.689 --> 00:05:32.699 
have to throw two needs um I think I

00:05:32.699 --> 00:05:34.310 
have to throw two needs um I think I
have<00:05:32.820> the<00:05:32.849> health<00:05:33.449> on<00:05:33.659> a<00:05:33.690> little<00:05:34.020> bit<00:05:34.139> lower

00:05:34.310 --> 00:05:34.320 
have the health on a little bit lower

00:05:34.320 --> 00:05:37.640 
have the health on a little bit lower
yeah<00:05:34.699> so<00:05:35.699> that<00:05:35.969> way<00:05:36.150> it'll<00:05:36.570> they'll<00:05:37.259> see<00:05:37.500> that

00:05:37.640 --> 00:05:37.650 
yeah so that way it'll they'll see that

00:05:37.650 --> 00:05:38.990 
yeah so that way it'll they'll see that
they're<00:05:37.800> gonna<00:05:37.949> get<00:05:38.159> the<00:05:38.280> kill<00:05:38.490> in<00:05:38.639> one<00:05:38.759> hit

00:05:38.990 --> 00:05:39.000 
they're gonna get the kill in one hit

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:41.390 
they're gonna get the kill in one hit
but<00:05:39.240> you<00:05:40.229> know<00:05:40.320> on<00:05:40.560> average<00:05:40.860> you're<00:05:41.280> gonna

00:05:41.390 --> 00:05:41.400 
but you know on average you're gonna

00:05:41.400 --> 00:05:43.189 
but you know on average you're gonna
have<00:05:41.580> to<00:05:41.699> throw<00:05:41.820> that<00:05:41.969> any<00:05:42.150> twice<00:05:42.599> to<00:05:42.930> get<00:05:43.020> the

00:05:43.189 --> 00:05:43.199 
have to throw that any twice to get the

00:05:43.199 --> 00:05:45.680 
have to throw that any twice to get the
kill<00:05:43.409> and<00:05:43.650> it<00:05:44.430> will<00:05:44.669> work<00:05:44.940> though<00:05:45.210> if<00:05:45.419> you<00:05:45.570> have

00:05:45.680 --> 00:05:45.690 
kill and it will work though if you have

00:05:45.690 --> 00:05:47.839 
kill and it will work though if you have
danger<00:05:46.080> close<00:05:46.320> or<00:05:46.710> if<00:05:46.979> you<00:05:47.099> throw<00:05:47.340> two<00:05:47.580> needs

00:05:47.839 --> 00:05:47.849 
danger close or if you throw two needs

00:05:47.849 --> 00:05:50.689 
danger close or if you throw two needs
and<00:05:48.150> it'll<00:05:48.509> be<00:05:48.599> good<00:05:48.719> to<00:05:48.840> go<00:05:48.990> so<00:05:49.469> on<00:05:49.710> defense<00:05:50.340> on

00:05:50.689 --> 00:05:50.699 
and it'll be good to go so on defense on

00:05:50.699 --> 00:05:53.270 
and it'll be good to go so on defense on
solar<00:05:51.060> I<00:05:51.210> pretty<00:05:51.570> much<00:05:51.690> do<00:05:52.080> this<00:05:52.289> strat<00:05:52.710> every

00:05:53.270 --> 00:05:53.280 
solar I pretty much do this strat every

00:05:53.280 --> 00:05:56.060 
solar I pretty much do this strat every
single<00:05:53.729> round<00:05:54.000> on<00:05:54.210> defense<00:05:54.690> the<00:05:55.530> way<00:05:55.650> to<00:05:55.710> go<00:05:56.009> is

00:05:56.060 --> 00:05:56.070 
single round on defense the way to go is

00:05:56.070 --> 00:05:58.249 
single round on defense the way to go is
you<00:05:56.280> just<00:05:56.460> need<00:05:56.729> a<00:05:56.759> street<00:05:57.240> like<00:05:57.419> usual<00:05:57.780> to<00:05:57.960> try

00:05:58.249 --> 00:05:58.259 
you just need a street like usual to try

00:05:58.259 --> 00:06:00.860 
you just need a street like usual to try
to<00:05:58.320> catch<00:05:58.560> them<00:05:58.740> going<00:05:58.919> a<00:05:59.610> and<00:06:00.030> then<00:06:00.630> you<00:06:00.750> just

00:06:00.860 --> 00:06:00.870 
to catch them going a and then you just

00:06:00.870 --> 00:06:02.480 
to catch them going a and then you just
run<00:06:01.139> up<00:06:01.349> into<00:06:01.530> this<00:06:01.770> corner<00:06:02.099> and<00:06:02.190> then<00:06:02.370> look

00:06:02.480 --> 00:06:02.490 
run up into this corner and then look

00:06:02.490 --> 00:06:04.100 
run up into this corner and then look
straight<00:06:02.789> up<00:06:02.820> like<00:06:03.120> I<00:06:03.210> just<00:06:03.270> did<00:06:03.509> and<00:06:03.900> then<00:06:04.020> the

00:06:04.100 --> 00:06:04.110 
straight up like I just did and then the

00:06:04.110 --> 00:06:06.050 
straight up like I just did and then the
needle<00:06:04.469> catch<00:06:04.710> them<00:06:04.979> going<00:06:05.130> to<00:06:05.310> be<00:06:05.460> every

00:06:06.050 --> 00:06:06.060 
needle catch them going to be every

00:06:06.060 --> 00:06:08.540 
needle catch them going to be every
single<00:06:06.449> time<00:06:06.830> super<00:06:07.830> useful<00:06:08.009> and<00:06:08.430> they're

00:06:08.540 --> 00:06:08.550 
single time super useful and they're

00:06:08.550 --> 00:06:10.490 
single time super useful and they're
pretty<00:06:08.789> much<00:06:08.849> like<00:06:09.479> destroyed<00:06:10.050> they<00:06:10.259> can't

00:06:10.490 --> 00:06:10.500 
pretty much like destroyed they can't

00:06:10.500 --> 00:06:12.920 
pretty much like destroyed they can't
choose<00:06:10.770> a<00:06:10.800> bomb<00:06:11.130> this<00:06:12.060> will<00:06:12.210> at<00:06:12.330> least<00:06:12.630> get<00:06:12.870> a

00:06:12.920 --> 00:06:12.930 
choose a bomb this will at least get a

00:06:12.930 --> 00:06:14.719 
choose a bomb this will at least get a
hitmarker<00:06:13.199> or<00:06:13.710> something<00:06:14.190> it'll<00:06:14.610> either

00:06:14.719 --> 00:06:14.729 
hitmarker or something it'll either

00:06:14.729 --> 00:06:17.089 
hitmarker or something it'll either
catch<00:06:15.060> them<00:06:15.300> going<00:06:15.539> to<00:06:15.750> be<00:06:15.960> or<00:06:16.199> in<00:06:16.349> gap<00:06:16.620> like<00:06:16.889> it

00:06:17.089 --> 00:06:17.099 
catch them going to be or in gap like it

00:06:17.099 --> 00:06:20.120 
catch them going to be or in gap like it
did<00:06:17.370> here<00:06:17.539> if<00:06:18.539> you<00:06:18.690> have<00:06:18.780> danger<00:06:19.110> close<00:06:19.380> the

00:06:20.120 --> 00:06:20.130 
did here if you have danger close the

00:06:20.130 --> 00:06:22.040 
did here if you have danger close the
blast<00:06:20.310> radius<00:06:20.520> is<00:06:21.000> insane<00:06:21.389> so<00:06:21.659> they're<00:06:21.840> pretty

00:06:22.040 --> 00:06:22.050 
blast radius is insane so they're pretty

00:06:22.050 --> 00:06:23.450
