00:00:06.620 --> 00:00:10.769
 Hi guys 

00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:13.920
 We are going to talk about today's skin class. 

00:00:10.769 --> 00:00:16.949
 greenish and dark circles to our model she 

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:19.590
 has a greenish skin tone and also 

00:00:16.949 --> 00:00:21.930
 have pots and we'll make the correction 

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:24.330
 and the neutralization of this skin 

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:27.240
 we get a creamy base and we're going 

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:31.410
 mix a green concealer to create 

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:35.550
 a tone very close to her skin color 

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:40.430
 mix very little concealer is 

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:40.430
 much more base than corrective 

00:00:50.300 --> 00:00:54.950
 we will apply the base on the whole face 

00:01:00.710 --> 00:01:08.880
 application compensate it to be made of a 

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:11.550
 consistent way, 

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:16.020
 to not be marked line series 

00:01:11.550 --> 00:01:19.340
 brushes and I always go 

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:19.340
 blurring my base 

00:01:42.909 --> 00:01:49.130
 look, guys, I'm applying the color of 

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:51.259
 even around the eyes that have the 

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:53.060
 goalkeepers because I'm going to find out what 

00:01:51.259 --> 00:01:55.930
 real color of their ranks so I can 

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:55.930
 neutralizing 

00:02:30.430 --> 00:02:53.900
 always remember to play with the 

00:02:32.959 --> 00:02:57.200
 is generating the excess of failures or 

00:02:53.900 --> 00:03:01.069
 I'm going to use the concealer of a 

00:02:57.200 --> 00:03:04.400
 to neutralize the threshold of the 

00:03:01.069 --> 00:03:07.430
 because our model is 

00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:12.769
 giving the base gave me a medium update 

00:03:07.430 --> 00:03:14.959
 greenish so the blue of the 

00:03:12.769 --> 00:03:17.150
 that properly for the thigh 

00:03:14.959 --> 00:03:19.790
 so I 'm going to use the coral 

00:03:17.150 --> 00:03:22.569
 orange to neutralize is soller 

00:03:19.790 --> 00:03:22.569
 bluish 

00:03:36.080 --> 00:03:45.650
 I'll apply where you have only the 

00:03:40.200 --> 00:03:45.650
 punctual only collar 

00:04:11.180 --> 00:04:17.489
 also apply along with coral a 

00:04:14.310 --> 00:04:19.680
 a little flesh-colored concealer 

00:04:17.489 --> 00:04:21.600
 so it will also counteract help 

00:04:19.680 --> 00:04:24.380
 to neutralize the parts that are the 

00:04:21.600 --> 00:04:24.380
 verdian 

00:04:35.990 --> 00:04:39.560
 very little 

00:05:04.780 --> 00:05:12.850
 return with base of skin color damage 

00:05:08.660 --> 00:05:12.850
 we just applied the base 

00:05:20.710 --> 00:05:27.370
 apply always and nevis beats you 

00:05:24.470 --> 00:05:32.290
 not withdraw the product is down 

00:05:27.370 --> 00:05:32.290
 always depositing the product 

00:05:45.380 --> 00:05:50.900
 note that if you do not apply the color base 

00:05:48.440 --> 00:05:53.360
 the skin on top of me and update 

00:05:50.900 --> 00:05:56.270
 on top of my colored concealer 

00:05:53.360 --> 00:05:59.000
 the color it will appear then by 

00:05:56.270 --> 00:06:01.700
 what we see there is to neutralize 

00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:05.710
 again to return there with the 

00:06:01.700 --> 00:06:05.710
 based on the person's skin color 

00:06:18.900 --> 00:07:02.940
 I think we'll seal with the powder and 

00:07:00.490 --> 00:07:02.940
 translucent powder 

00:07:24.510 --> 00:07:27.510
 like this 

00:07:35.460 --> 00:07:54.289
 your finger to enter the date with 

00:07:42.750 --> 00:07:54.289
 corrective who
