about<00:00:56.750> ways<00:00:57.140> to<00:00:57.170> shuffle<00:00:57.559> deck<00:00:57.890> I<00:00:58.420> said<00:00:59.420> the

00:00:59.770 --> 00:00:59.780 
about ways to shuffle deck I said the

00:00:59.780 --> 00:01:02.320 
about ways to shuffle deck I said the
most<00:01:00.260> common<00:01:00.680> way<00:01:00.890> to<00:01:00.920> shuffle<00:01:01.339> blank<00:01:02.000> cards

00:01:02.320 --> 00:01:02.330 
most common way to shuffle blank cards

00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:04.660 
most common way to shuffle blank cards
in<00:01:02.480> the<00:01:02.570> Ignite<00:01:02.870> in<00:01:03.320> united<00:01:03.739> kingdom<00:01:03.769> is<00:01:04.250> the

00:01:04.660 --> 00:01:04.670 
in the Ignite in united kingdom is the

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:07.770 
in the Ignite in united kingdom is the
overhand<00:01:05.119> shuffle<00:01:05.210> which<00:01:05.960> clothes<00:01:06.200> like<00:01:06.440> this

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:07.780 
overhand shuffle which clothes like this

00:01:07.780 --> 00:01:10.840 
overhand shuffle which clothes like this
it's<00:01:08.780> a<00:01:08.840> very<00:01:09.050> easy<00:01:09.259> shuffle<00:01:09.860> and<00:01:10.009> therefore

00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:10.850 
it's a very easy shuffle and therefore

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:14.109 
it's a very easy shuffle and therefore
is<00:01:11.060> used<00:01:11.869> a<00:01:12.050> lot<00:01:12.190> but<00:01:13.190> I<00:01:13.250> think<00:01:13.640> this<00:01:13.790> is<00:01:13.850> not<00:01:14.090> a

00:01:14.109 --> 00:01:14.119 
is used a lot but I think this is not a

00:01:14.119 --> 00:01:15.850 
is used a lot but I think this is not a
good<00:01:14.300> way<00:01:14.479> to<00:01:14.540> shuffle<00:01:14.900> deck<00:01:15.229> because<00:01:15.680> you're

00:01:15.850 --> 00:01:15.860 
good way to shuffle deck because you're

00:01:15.860 --> 00:01:18.490 
good way to shuffle deck because you're
mainly<00:01:16.100> reversing<00:01:16.759> the<00:01:16.850> border<00:01:17.210> and<00:01:17.660> in<00:01:18.380> the

00:01:18.490 --> 00:01:18.500 
mainly reversing the border and in the

00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:21.010 
mainly reversing the border and in the
United<00:01:18.890> States<00:01:18.950> they<00:01:19.399> use<00:01:19.550> this<00:01:19.850> shuffle<00:01:20.479> they

00:01:21.010 --> 00:01:21.020 
United States they use this shuffle they

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:25.719 
United States they use this shuffle they
cut<00:01:21.350> the<00:01:21.470> deck<00:01:21.680> this<00:01:22.280> and<00:01:22.810> shuffle<00:01:23.810> them<00:01:24.729> like

00:01:25.719 --> 00:01:25.729 
cut the deck this and shuffle them like

00:01:25.729 --> 00:01:27.310 
cut the deck this and shuffle them like
this<00:01:25.910> and<00:01:26.240> then

00:01:27.310 --> 00:01:27.320 
this and then

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:29.620 
this and then
push<00:01:27.920> them<00:01:28.130> together

00:01:29.620 --> 00:01:29.630 
push them together

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:32.050 
push them together
another<00:01:30.590> way<00:01:30.770> which<00:01:31.009> is<00:01:31.040> very<00:01:31.430> similar<00:01:31.820> to

00:03:13.670 --> 00:03:13.680 
hopefully all the guards would have

00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:16.770 
hopefully all the guards would have
turned<00:03:14.190> face<00:03:14.760> down

00:03:16.770 --> 00:03:16.780
