00:00:11.510 --> 00:00:11.520 
tanks here I'm prepping a piece of

00:00:11.520 --> 00:00:14.720 
tanks here I'm prepping a piece of
acrylic<00:00:11.790> by<00:00:12.330> taking<00:00:13.080> the<00:00:13.140> plastic<00:00:13.560> off<00:00:13.730> and

00:00:14.720 --> 00:00:14.730 
acrylic by taking the plastic off and

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:16.970 
acrylic by taking the plastic off and
for<00:00:15.030> me<00:00:15.180> when<00:00:15.540> I<00:00:15.570> work<00:00:15.809> without<00:00:16.049> calling<00:00:16.500> I<00:00:16.770> am

00:00:16.970 --> 00:00:16.980 
for me when I work without calling I am

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:19.480 
for me when I work without calling I am
much<00:00:17.189> more<00:00:17.430> interested<00:00:17.490> in<00:00:18.180> having

00:00:19.480 --> 00:00:19.490 
much more interested in having

00:00:19.490 --> 00:00:22.100 
much more interested in having
concentrated<00:00:20.490> color<00:00:20.730> when<00:00:21.450> you<00:00:21.540> see<00:00:21.660> Tim<00:00:21.869> work

00:00:22.100 --> 00:00:22.110 
concentrated color when you see Tim work

00:00:22.110 --> 00:00:23.540 
concentrated color when you see Tim work
with<00:00:22.259> things<00:00:22.529> he<00:00:22.770> likes<00:00:22.980> to<00:00:23.099> do<00:00:23.189> lots<00:00:23.369> of

with things he likes to do lots of
blending<00:00:24.029> and<00:00:24.270> lots<00:00:24.509> of<00:00:24.810> making<00:00:25.739> all<00:00:25.860> kinds<00:00:26.220> of

00:00:26.330 --> 00:00:26.340 
blending and lots of making all kinds of

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:28.640 
blending and lots of making all kinds of
interesting<00:00:27.239> blended<00:00:27.810> images<00:00:28.200> and<00:00:28.380> I'm<00:00:28.470> much

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:28.650 
interesting blended images and I'm much

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:30.010 
interesting blended images and I'm much
more<00:00:28.890> interested<00:00:29.009> in<00:00:29.340> let's<00:00:29.489> just<00:00:29.579> do

00:00:30.010 --> 00:00:30.020 
more interested in let's just do

00:00:30.020 --> 00:00:32.620 
more interested in let's just do
concentrated<00:00:31.020> color<00:00:31.140> or<00:00:31.500> making<00:00:31.950> patterns

00:00:32.620 --> 00:00:32.630 
concentrated color or making patterns

00:00:32.630 --> 00:00:35.330 
concentrated color or making patterns
let<00:00:33.630> me<00:00:33.720> show<00:00:33.989> you<00:00:34.050> this<00:00:34.500> is<00:00:34.710> really<00:00:35.040> simple

00:00:35.330 --> 00:00:35.340 
let me show you this is really simple

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:37.520 
let me show you this is really simple
anybody<00:00:35.730> can<00:00:35.910> do<00:00:36.000> this<00:00:36.149> sort<00:00:37.140> of<00:00:37.199> thing<00:00:37.410> it

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:37.530 
anybody can do this sort of thing it

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:40.340 
anybody can do this sort of thing it
doesn't<00:00:37.710> have<00:00:37.890> to<00:00:38.129> be<00:00:38.280> complicated<00:00:39.090> I<00:00:39.660> am<00:00:40.170> just

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:40.350 
doesn't have to be complicated I am just

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:42.529 
doesn't have to be complicated I am just
going<00:00:40.530> to<00:00:40.739> create<00:00:41.010> drops<00:00:41.489> here<00:00:41.820> right<00:00:42.090> on<00:00:42.269> top

00:00:42.529 --> 00:00:42.539 
going to create drops here right on top

00:00:42.539 --> 00:00:45.680 
going to create drops here right on top
of<00:00:42.719> the<00:00:42.870> acrylic<00:00:43.579> I'm<00:00:44.579> an<00:00:44.670> odd<00:00:44.850> number<00:00:45.269> person

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:45.690 
of the acrylic I'm an odd number person

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:48.919 
of the acrylic I'm an odd number person
so<00:00:46.289> I'm<00:00:46.379> usually<00:00:46.559> gonna<00:00:46.829> make<00:00:47.190> an<00:00:47.879> odd<00:00:48.179> number

00:00:48.919 --> 00:00:48.929 
so I'm usually gonna make an odd number

00:00:48.929 --> 00:00:52.189 
so I'm usually gonna make an odd number
of<00:00:49.050> dots<00:00:49.289> I'm<00:00:49.559> barely<00:00:50.780> squeezing<00:00:51.780> the<00:00:52.019> tap

00:00:52.189 --> 00:00:52.199 
of dots I'm barely squeezing the tap

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:54.020 
of dots I'm barely squeezing the tap
they<00:00:52.649> never<00:00:52.859> really<00:00:53.010> are<00:00:53.100> the<00:00:53.280> bottle<00:00:53.789> itself

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:54.030 
they never really are the bottle itself

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:55.520 
they never really are the bottle itself
you<00:00:54.210> don't<00:00:54.329> have<00:00:54.449> to<00:00:54.600> squeeze<00:00:54.839> it<00:00:55.019> very<00:00:55.199> hard

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:55.530 
you don't have to squeeze it very hard

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:58.080 
you don't have to squeeze it very hard
to<00:00:56.309> get<00:00:56.460> that<00:00:56.579> ink<00:00:56.820> to<00:00:56.999> come<00:00:57.179> out

00:00:58.080 --> 00:00:58.090 
to get that ink to come out

00:00:58.090 --> 00:01:00.270 
to get that ink to come out
so<00:00:58.449> usually<00:00:58.600> I<00:00:58.780> do<00:00:58.870> about<00:00:59.079> seven<00:00:59.590> on<00:00:59.739> there<00:01:00.039> and

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:00.280 
so usually I do about seven on there and

00:01:00.280 --> 00:01:02.010 
so usually I do about seven on there and
then<00:01:00.460> I<00:01:00.489> let<00:01:00.730> it<00:01:00.820> dry<00:01:01.090> a<00:01:01.120> little<00:01:01.360> bit<00:01:01.539> before<00:01:01.930> I

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:02.020 
then I let it dry a little bit before I

00:01:02.020 --> 00:01:05.160 
then I let it dry a little bit before I
add<00:01:02.370> another<00:01:03.370> layer<00:01:03.730> but<00:01:04.540> you<00:01:04.570> can<00:01:04.780> see<00:01:04.960> here's

00:01:05.160 --> 00:01:05.170 
add another layer but you can see here's

00:01:05.170 --> 00:01:07.590 
add another layer but you can see here's
an<00:01:05.290> example<00:01:05.590> of<00:01:05.860> one<00:01:06.100> where<00:01:06.940> I've<00:01:07.090> done<00:01:07.330> three

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:07.600 
an example of one where I've done three

00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:10.170 
an example of one where I've done three
different<00:01:07.930> layers<00:01:08.110> on<00:01:08.770> some<00:01:09.670> of<00:01:09.790> these<00:01:09.940> so

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:10.180 
different layers on some of these so

00:01:10.180 --> 00:01:11.550 
different layers on some of these so
this<00:01:10.299> would<00:01:10.450> be<00:01:10.540> the<00:01:10.630> first<00:01:10.869> one<00:01:11.110> and<00:01:11.380> then<00:01:11.440> the

00:01:11.550 --> 00:01:11.560 
this would be the first one and then the

00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:12.950 
this would be the first one and then the
second<00:01:11.950> one<00:01:12.070> of<00:01:12.190> the<00:01:12.310> third

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:12.960 
second one of the third

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:15.230 
second one of the third
this<00:01:13.560> is<00:01:13.710> using<00:01:14.010> one<00:01:14.130> of<00:01:14.159> the<00:01:14.370> mix<00:01:14.610> it<00:01:14.760> is<00:01:14.880> which

00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:15.240 
this is using one of the mix it is which

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:19.000 
this is using one of the mix it is which
is<00:01:15.270> the<00:01:15.510> pearl<00:01:16.040> mix<00:01:17.040> it<00:01:17.190> is<00:01:17.420> and<00:01:18.420> here's<00:01:18.810> a

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:19.010 
is the pearl mix it is and here's a

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:21.500 
is the pearl mix it is and here's a
silver<00:01:20.010> mix<00:01:20.400> it<00:01:20.520> up<00:01:20.640> as<00:01:20.790> well<00:01:20.970> which<00:01:21.150> I<00:01:21.270> really

00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:21.510 
silver mix it up as well which I really

00:01:21.510 --> 00:01:24.810 
silver mix it up as well which I really
like<00:01:21.720> that<00:01:21.950> concentrated<00:01:22.950> silver<00:01:23.880> on<00:01:24.060> there

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:24.820 
like that concentrated silver on there

00:01:24.820 --> 00:01:27.930 
like that concentrated silver on there
another<00:01:25.390> thing<00:01:25.540> you<00:01:25.660> can<00:01:25.840> do<00:01:26.080> is<00:01:26.730> let's<00:01:27.730> make<00:01:27.910> a

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:27.940 
another thing you can do is let's make a

00:01:27.940 --> 00:01:30.540 
another thing you can do is let's make a
new<00:01:28.180> pattern<00:01:28.540> on<00:01:28.810> top<00:01:28.840> of<00:01:29.200> this<00:01:29.320> one<00:01:29.530> I<00:01:29.860> like<00:01:30.400> to

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:30.550 
new pattern on top of this one I like to

00:01:30.550 --> 00:01:32.640 
new pattern on top of this one I like to
use<00:01:30.580> the<00:01:30.880> the<00:01:31.150> foam<00:01:31.390> instead<00:01:31.780> of<00:01:31.900> the<00:01:32.020> felt<00:01:32.320> and

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:32.650 
use the the foam instead of the felt and

00:01:32.650 --> 00:01:35.610 
use the the foam instead of the felt and
on<00:01:33.160> top<00:01:33.400> of<00:01:33.610> the<00:01:33.700> foam<00:01:33.970> you<00:01:34.210> can<00:01:34.390> make<00:01:34.690> like

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:35.620 
on top of the foam you can make like

00:01:35.620 --> 00:01:38.340 
on top of the foam you can make like
making<00:01:35.980> your<00:01:36.070> own<00:01:36.130> stamp<00:01:36.670> with<00:01:37.060> the<00:01:37.090> ink<00:01:37.420> so

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:38.350 
making your own stamp with the ink so

00:01:38.350 --> 00:01:39.480 
making your own stamp with the ink so
I'm<00:01:38.440> going<00:01:38.590> to<00:01:38.620> actually<00:01:38.920> go<00:01:39.040> ahead<00:01:39.070> and<00:01:39.250> just

00:01:39.480 --> 00:01:39.490 
I'm going to actually go ahead and just

00:01:39.490 --> 00:01:43.590 
I'm going to actually go ahead and just
make<00:01:39.730> a<00:01:39.760> circle<00:01:41.550> here<00:01:42.550> on<00:01:42.730> top<00:01:43.000> of<00:01:43.210> here<00:01:43.390> that

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:43.600 
make a circle here on top of here that

00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:45.870 
make a circle here on top of here that
it's<00:01:43.780> going<00:01:43.840> to<00:01:44.140> end<00:01:44.800> up<00:01:44.950> being<00:01:45.130> my<00:01:45.310> image<00:01:45.640> that

00:01:45.870 --> 00:01:45.880 
it's going to end up being my image that

00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:50.440 
it's going to end up being my image that
will<00:01:46.000> come<00:01:46.210> off<00:01:46.240> on<00:01:46.750> the<00:01:47.350> acrylic

00:01:50.440 --> 00:01:50.450 

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:55.060 

see<00:01:50.810> just<00:01:51.020> adding<00:01:51.409> in<00:01:51.909> few<00:01:53.200> circles<00:01:54.200> there<00:01:54.440> to

00:01:55.060 --> 00:01:55.070 
see just adding in few circles there to

00:01:55.070 --> 00:01:57.730 
see just adding in few circles there to
make<00:01:55.220> my<00:01:55.430> own<00:01:55.610> sorts<00:01:56.300> of<00:01:56.420> patterns<00:01:56.900> you<00:01:57.260> can

00:01:57.730 --> 00:01:57.740 
make my own sorts of patterns you can

00:01:57.740 --> 00:02:00.250 
make my own sorts of patterns you can
also<00:01:57.950> do<00:01:58.460> a<00:01:58.820> variety<00:01:59.330> of<00:01:59.360> different<00:01:59.690> smaller

00:02:00.250 --> 00:02:00.260 
also do a variety of different smaller

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:05.050 
also do a variety of different smaller
dots<00:02:02.350> which<00:02:03.350> would<00:02:03.590> be<00:02:03.710> like<00:02:03.920> this<00:02:04.190> one<00:02:04.250> and

00:02:05.050 --> 00:02:05.060 
dots which would be like this one and

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:07.030 
dots which would be like this one and
here's<00:02:05.270> kind<00:02:05.540> of<00:02:05.570> the<00:02:05.720> sample<00:02:06.229> of<00:02:06.680> what<00:02:06.890> that

00:02:07.030 --> 00:02:07.040 
here's kind of the sample of what that

00:02:07.040 --> 00:02:09.070 
here's kind of the sample of what that
looks<00:02:07.280> like<00:02:07.430> it's<00:02:07.670> simply<00:02:08.000> just<00:02:08.060> making<00:02:08.600> dots

00:02:09.070 --> 00:02:09.080 
looks like it's simply just making dots

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:11.410 
looks like it's simply just making dots
on<00:02:09.350> top<00:02:09.380> of<00:02:09.770> the<00:02:09.890> foam<00:02:10.130> and<00:02:10.490> then<00:02:10.940> go<00:02:11.090> ahead<00:02:11.209> and

00:02:11.410 --> 00:02:11.420 
on top of the foam and then go ahead and

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:13.440 
on top of the foam and then go ahead and
stamping<00:02:12.020> that<00:02:12.140> right<00:02:12.440> onto<00:02:12.890> the<00:02:13.040> acrylic

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:13.450 
stamping that right onto the acrylic

00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:15.970 
stamping that right onto the acrylic
it's<00:02:14.450> kind<00:02:14.600> of<00:02:14.630> a<00:02:14.720> fun<00:02:14.930> different<00:02:15.590> way<00:02:15.680> to<00:02:15.740> do

00:02:15.970 --> 00:02:15.980 
it's kind of a fun different way to do

00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:17.600 
it's kind of a fun different way to do
it

00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:17.610 
it

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:20.390 
it
in<00:02:17.970> an<00:02:18.090> alleyway<00:02:18.390> to<00:02:18.810> do<00:02:19.050> it<00:02:19.200> instead

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:20.400 
in an alleyway to do it instead

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:25.010 
in an alleyway to do it instead

00:02:41.890 --> 00:02:41.900 
and these ones they spread out a little

00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:44.470 
and these ones they spread out a little
bit<00:02:42.140> more<00:02:42.320> this<00:02:42.470> was<00:02:42.680> the<00:02:42.920> proper<00:02:43.700> mix<00:02:44.090> enough

00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:50.200 
witness when the background ink is still
wet<00:02:47.620> or<00:02:48.620> not<00:02:48.890> as<00:02:49.070> dry<00:02:49.310> as<00:02:49.370> the<00:02:49.790> other<00:02:49.940> ones

00:02:50.200 --> 00:02:50.210
