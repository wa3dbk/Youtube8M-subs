00:03:23.739 --> 00:03:29.120
 The race today was very special so 

00:03:26.709 --> 00:03:30.709
 I was not so good at the start 

00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:33.380
 outstanding 

00:03:30.709 --> 00:03:39.019
 Most of the time it could be but then 

00:03:33.380 --> 00:03:42.019
 thanks to a quick profit and 

00:03:39.019 --> 00:03:46.299
 then the other competitors on the 

00:03:42.019 --> 00:03:46.299
 track overtaking and he always has 

00:03:46.510 --> 00:03:51.440
 negative before very good or had too 

00:03:49.549 --> 00:03:54.019
 luck , you also have to say a lot 

00:03:51.440 --> 00:03:55.959
 good luck today but that belongs 

00:03:54.019 --> 00:03:58.910
 I just think to win 

00:03:55.959 --> 00:04:01.269
 yes and that was my first final 

00:03:58.910 --> 00:04:04.269
 and a victory that is natural 

00:04:01.269 --> 00:04:04.269
 indescribably
