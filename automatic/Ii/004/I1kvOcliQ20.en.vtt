00:02:30.370 --> 00:02:30.380 
boost and super boost you can get by

00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:32.290 
boost and super boost you can get by
collecting<00:02:30.980> going<00:02:31.400> through<00:02:31.550> those<00:02:31.640> rings<00:02:31.970> and

00:02:35.199 --> 00:02:35.209 
grinding and having close calls I don't

00:02:35.209 --> 00:02:37.979 
grinding and having close calls I don't
do<00:02:35.360> close<00:02:35.630> calls<00:02:35.959> i<00:02:36.200> do<00:02:36.260> just<00:02:36.590> hitting<00:02:36.980> things

00:02:37.979 --> 00:02:37.989 
do close calls i do just hitting things

do close calls i do just hitting things
it<00:02:38.989> is<00:02:39.769> kind<00:02:39.980> of<00:02:40.040> live<00:02:40.310> near<00:02:40.549> the<00:02:41.360> path<00:02:41.630> just

00:02:41.949 --> 00:02:41.959 
it is kind of live near the path just

00:02:41.959 --> 00:02:45.880 
it is kind of live near the path just
what<00:02:42.110> I<00:02:42.410> supposed<00:02:43.220> to<00:02:43.370> take<00:02:43.610> is<00:02:44.769> pretty<00:02:45.769> much

00:02:45.880 --> 00:02:45.890 
what I supposed to take is pretty much

been using this engine lately and bam
now<00:03:20.540> let's<00:03:20.720> do<00:03:20.959> that<00:03:21.080> again<00:03:21.230> maybe<00:03:21.590> on<00:03:21.740> a

00:03:21.760 --> 00:03:21.770 
now let's do that again maybe on a

00:03:21.770 --> 00:03:24.910 
now let's do that again maybe on a
harder<00:03:22.130> difficulty<00:03:22.550> here<00:03:23.380> that<00:03:24.380> didn't<00:03:24.830> take

00:03:24.910 --> 00:03:24.920 
harder difficulty here that didn't take

00:03:24.920 --> 00:03:27.640 
harder difficulty here that didn't take
very<00:03:24.980> long<00:03:25.160> is<00:03:25.459> not<00:03:25.490> a<00:03:25.760> very<00:03:26.030> long<00:03:26.300> game<00:03:26.650> but

00:03:27.640 --> 00:03:27.650 
very long is not a very long game but

00:03:27.650 --> 00:03:29.199 
very long is not a very long game but
it's<00:03:28.160> a<00:03:28.250> heck<00:03:28.430> of<00:03:28.459> a<00:03:28.610> lot<00:03:28.640> of<00:03:28.819> fun<00:03:29.030> you're

00:03:29.199 --> 00:03:29.209 
it's a heck of a lot of fun you're

00:03:29.209 --> 00:03:31.750 
it's a heck of a lot of fun you're
writing<00:03:29.480> a<00:03:29.599> bullet<00:03:30.280> what<00:03:31.280> could<00:03:31.430> be<00:03:31.459> more<00:03:31.580> fun

00:03:31.750 --> 00:03:31.760 
writing a bullet what could be more fun

00:03:31.760 --> 00:03:37.320 
writing a bullet what could be more fun
than<00:03:32.000> trying<00:03:32.300> a<00:03:32.450> bullet<00:03:33.250> let's<00:03:34.250> skip<00:03:34.550> that

00:03:37.320 --> 00:03:37.330 

00:03:37.330 --> 00:03:39.160 

once<00:03:38.330> you<00:03:38.450> learn<00:03:38.599> the<00:03:38.630> path<00:03:38.930> it's

00:03:39.160 --> 00:03:39.170 
once you learn the path it's

00:03:39.170 --> 00:03:43.270 
once you learn the path it's
considerably<00:03:39.739> easier<00:03:41.380> and<00:03:42.380> hard<00:03:42.890> mode<00:03:43.130> you

00:03:43.270 --> 00:03:43.280 
considerably easier and hard mode you

00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:44.979 
considerably easier and hard mode you
it's<00:03:43.489> a<00:03:43.730> little<00:03:43.940> shaky<00:03:44.390> er<00:03:44.450> to<00:03:44.599> control

00:03:44.979 --> 00:03:44.989 
it's a little shaky er to control

00:03:44.989 --> 00:03:50.860 
it's a little shaky er to control
actually<00:03:48.459> the<00:03:49.459> splat<00:03:50.000> when<00:03:50.239> you<00:03:50.390> hit<00:03:50.540> a<00:03:50.569> wall

00:03:50.860 --> 00:03:50.870 
actually the splat when you hit a wall

00:03:50.870 --> 00:03:55.120 
actually the splat when you hit a wall
is<00:03:51.140> kind<00:03:51.440> of<00:03:51.590> seriously<00:03:52.280> painful<00:03:52.489> again<00:03:54.130> so

00:03:55.120 --> 00:03:55.130 
is kind of seriously painful again so

00:03:55.130 --> 00:03:56.589 
is kind of seriously painful again so
the<00:03:55.280> moral<00:03:55.520> of<00:03:55.610> this<00:03:55.730> story<00:03:55.790> is<00:03:56.060> it's<00:03:56.330> not<00:03:56.569> a

00:03:56.589 --> 00:03:56.599 
the moral of this story is it's not a

00:03:56.599 --> 00:04:01.540 
the moral of this story is it's not a
good<00:03:56.840> idea<00:03:56.870> to<00:03:57.170> write<00:03:57.349> a<00:03:57.410> bullet<00:03:57.890> whoa<00:04:00.370> yeah<00:04:01.370> if

00:04:01.540 --> 00:04:01.550 
good idea to write a bullet whoa yeah if

00:04:01.550 --> 00:04:04.620 
good idea to write a bullet whoa yeah if
you<00:04:01.940> lose<00:04:02.120> too<00:04:02.300> much<00:04:02.390> speed<00:04:02.780> you<00:04:03.170> will<00:04:03.349> crash

00:04:04.620 --> 00:04:04.630 
you lose too much speed you will crash

00:04:04.630 --> 00:04:08.050 
you lose too much speed you will crash
so<00:04:05.630> just<00:04:05.870> keep<00:04:05.989> using<00:04:06.170> some<00:04:06.440> turbo<00:04:06.860> here<00:04:07.160> grind

00:04:08.050 --> 00:04:08.060 
so just keep using some turbo here grind

00:04:08.060 --> 00:04:13.600 
so just keep using some turbo here grind
to<00:04:08.390> get<00:04:08.510> some<00:04:08.690> more<00:04:08.810> turbo

00:04:13.600 --> 00:04:13.610 

00:04:13.610 --> 00:04:16.520 

you<00:04:14.610> have<00:04:14.700> the<00:04:14.790> speed<00:04:15.090> meter<00:04:15.330> down<00:04:15.600> in<00:04:16.350> the

00:04:16.520 --> 00:04:16.530 
you have the speed meter down in the

00:04:16.530 --> 00:04:23.330 
you have the speed meter down in the
lower<00:04:16.739> left<00:04:21.650> trying<00:04:22.650> to<00:04:22.830> do<00:04:22.980> this<00:04:23.130> without

lower left trying to do this without

00:04:23.340 --> 00:04:34.610 
lower left trying to do this without
messing<00:04:24.000> it<00:04:24.030> up<00:04:24.150> okay<00:04:31.250> this<00:04:32.250> is<00:04:33.620> pretty

00:04:34.610 --> 00:04:34.620 
messing it up okay this is pretty

00:04:34.620 --> 00:04:36.260

00:04:53.300 --> 00:04:53.310 
nature actually a Kickstarter game i did

00:04:53.310 --> 00:04:59.630 
nature actually a Kickstarter game i did
a<00:04:53.340> video<00:04:53.490> on<00:04:53.669> ah<00:04:56.450> dang<00:04:57.450> it<00:04:58.070> this<00:04:59.070> gets

00:04:59.630 --> 00:04:59.640 
a video on ah dang it this gets

00:04:59.640 --> 00:05:04.969 
a video on ah dang it this gets
ridiculous<00:05:00.240> I<00:05:02.210> keep<00:05:03.210> trying<00:05:03.450> to<00:05:03.600> boost<00:05:03.840> to<00:05:04.140> go

00:05:04.969 --> 00:05:04.979 
ridiculous I keep trying to boost to go

00:05:04.979 --> 00:05:07.219 
ridiculous I keep trying to boost to go
faster<00:05:05.700> but<00:05:05.729> then<00:05:06.030> it<00:05:06.210> just<00:05:06.360> makes<00:05:06.750> me<00:05:06.870> kind<00:05:07.169> of

00:05:07.219 --> 00:05:07.229 
faster but then it just makes me kind of

00:05:07.229 --> 00:05:14.900 
faster but then it just makes me kind of
lose<00:05:07.380> control<00:05:09.800> there<00:05:10.800> we<00:05:10.979> go<00:05:11.160> I<00:05:13.490> can<00:05:14.490> super

00:05:14.900 --> 00:05:14.910 
lose control there we go I can super

00:05:14.910 --> 00:05:24.260 
lose control there we go I can super
boost<00:05:15.120> now<00:05:15.770> do<00:05:16.770> that<00:05:16.950> now<00:05:17.430> ah<00:05:21.200> and<00:05:22.880> that's<00:05:23.880> the

00:05:24.260 --> 00:05:24.270 
boost now do that now ah and that's the

00:05:24.270 --> 00:05:30.590 
boost now do that now ah and that's the
downside<00:05:24.570> to<00:05:24.990> boosting<00:05:28.850> it<00:05:29.850> becomes<00:05:30.150> quite

00:05:30.590 --> 00:05:30.600 
downside to boosting it becomes quite

00:05:30.600 --> 00:05:36.409 
downside to boosting it becomes quite
ridiculous<00:05:31.140> to<00:05:31.500> try<00:05:31.530> to<00:05:31.710> control<00:05:34.070> okay<00:05:35.419> let's

00:05:36.409 --> 00:05:36.419 
ridiculous to try to control okay let's

00:05:36.419 --> 00:05:44.180 
ridiculous to try to control okay let's
just<00:05:36.810> survive<00:05:37.320> another<00:05:38.039> vent<00:05:38.820> here
