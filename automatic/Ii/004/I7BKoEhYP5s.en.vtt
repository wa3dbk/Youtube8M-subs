00:03:56.229 --> 00:03:56.239 
disbelief that is this belief it's

00:03:56.239 --> 00:03:58.150 
disbelief that is this belief it's
tantamount<00:03:56.449> to<00:03:56.629> display<00:03:57.049> because<00:03:57.410> ultimately

00:03:58.150 --> 00:03:58.160 
tantamount to display because ultimately

00:04:00.230 --> 00:04:02.680 
if you don't pray then you're actually
on<00:04:00.260> the<00:04:00.440> door<00:04:00.620> of<00:04:00.650> disbelief<00:04:01.220> so<00:04:02.000> I<00:04:02.209> can<00:04:02.449> cream

00:04:02.680 --> 00:04:02.690 
on the door of disbelief so I can cream

00:04:02.690 --> 00:04:04.390 
on the door of disbelief so I can cream
the<00:04:02.900> point<00:04:03.199> I'm<00:04:03.319> trying<00:04:03.379> to<00:04:03.560> make<00:04:03.650> is<00:04:03.919> Salah<00:04:04.250> is
