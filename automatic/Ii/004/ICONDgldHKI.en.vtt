00:00:01.790 --> 00:00:01.800 
a little sneak preview little last week

00:00:01.800 --> 00:00:03.439 
a little sneak preview little last week
he's<00:00:02.010> had<00:00:02.190> some<00:00:02.429> soft<00:00:02.669> tissue<00:00:02.879> injuries<00:00:03.270> and

00:00:03.439 --> 00:00:03.449 
he's had some soft tissue injuries and

00:00:03.449 --> 00:00:05.809 
he's had some soft tissue injuries and
hamstring<00:00:03.870> problems<00:00:04.290> and<00:00:04.500> the<00:00:05.370> horse<00:00:05.549> think

00:00:05.809 --> 00:00:05.819 
hamstring problems and the horse think

00:00:05.819 --> 00:00:07.880 
hamstring problems and the horse think
it<00:00:05.910> might<00:00:06.120> be<00:00:06.150> related<00:00:06.750> to<00:00:06.779> his<00:00:07.140> running<00:00:07.529> gait

00:00:07.880 --> 00:00:07.890 
it might be related to his running gait

00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:10.280 
it might be related to his running gait
so<00:00:08.220> the<00:00:08.490> head<00:00:08.639> of<00:00:08.730> fitness<00:00:09.120> and<00:00:09.420> ER<00:00:09.809> Russell

00:00:10.280 --> 00:00:10.290 
so the head of fitness and ER Russell

00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:12.620 
so the head of fitness and ER Russell
has<00:00:10.530> got<00:00:10.650> a<00:00:10.679> big<00:00:10.980> job<00:00:11.250> trying<00:00:11.700> to<00:00:11.820> change<00:00:12.090> soory

in<00:00:20.220> the<00:00:20.369> gym<00:00:20.550> I've<00:00:20.699> never<00:00:20.910> seen<00:00:21.150> anyone

00:00:31.960 --> 00:00:31.970 

00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:34.580 

we<00:00:32.970> need<00:00:33.150> to<00:00:33.270> improve<00:00:33.480> mechanics<00:00:34.320> with<00:00:34.440> user

00:00:34.580 --> 00:00:34.590 
we need to improve mechanics with user

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:37.550 
we need to improve mechanics with user
experience<00:00:34.710> of<00:00:35.070> posture<00:00:35.460> so<00:00:36.120> Perry<00:00:36.630> runs<00:00:36.900> and

00:00:37.550 --> 00:00:37.560 
experience of posture so Perry runs and

00:00:37.560 --> 00:00:39.800 
experience of posture so Perry runs and
holidays<00:00:38.040> off<00:00:38.310> you<00:00:38.490> when<00:00:38.640> he<00:00:38.700> gets<00:00:38.790> petit<00:00:39.210> does

00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:39.810 
holidays off you when he gets petit does

00:00:39.810 --> 00:00:41.360 
holidays off you when he gets petit does
he<00:00:39.900> run<00:00:40.080> very<00:00:40.380> very<00:00:40.440> well<00:00:40.830> when<00:00:41.250> he's

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:41.370 
he run very very well when he's

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:43.370 
he run very very well when he's
accelerating<00:00:41.760> and<00:00:42.180> when<00:00:42.330> he's<00:00:42.420> fresh<00:00:42.720> it's

00:00:43.370 --> 00:00:43.380 
accelerating and when he's fresh it's

00:00:43.380 --> 00:00:45.740 
accelerating and when he's fresh it's
when<00:00:43.530> he<00:00:43.590> starts<00:00:43.920> to<00:00:44.040> get<00:00:44.130> fatigued<00:00:44.489> but<00:00:45.360> any

00:00:45.740 --> 00:00:45.750 
when he starts to get fatigued but any

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:47.960 
when he starts to get fatigued but any
deficiency<00:00:46.350> has<00:00:46.590> really<00:00:47.040> starts<00:00:47.489> to<00:00:47.610> blow<00:00:47.790> out

00:00:47.960 --> 00:00:47.970 
deficiency has really starts to blow out

00:00:47.970 --> 00:00:49.369 
deficiency has really starts to blow out
and<00:00:48.300> that's<00:00:48.480> what<00:00:48.629> you<00:00:48.720> really<00:00:49.020> start<00:00:49.290> the

00:00:49.369 --> 00:00:49.379 
and that's what you really start the

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:53.170 
and that's what you really start the
loads<00:00:49.559> hamstrings<00:00:50.160> up<00:00:50.280> when<00:00:50.460> you<00:00:50.520> get<00:00:50.670> to<00:00:50.850> take

00:00:53.170 --> 00:00:53.180 

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:55.580 

the<00:00:54.180> other<00:00:54.300> thing<00:00:54.570> to<00:00:54.750> junior<00:00:55.050> is<00:00:55.140> how<00:00:55.350> high

00:00:55.580 --> 00:00:55.590 
the other thing to junior is how high

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:59.799 
the other thing to junior is how high
your<00:00:55.770> decelerates<00:00:56.510> he<00:00:57.510> goes<00:00:57.720> that's<00:00:58.200> the<00:00:58.470> size

00:00:59.799 --> 00:00:59.809 
your decelerates he goes that's the size

00:00:59.809 --> 00:01:03.110 
your decelerates he goes that's the size
changes<00:01:00.809> direction<00:01:01.550> huge<00:01:02.550> amount<00:01:02.820> of<00:01:02.910> force

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:03.120 
changes direction huge amount of force

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:05.329 
changes direction huge amount of force
and<00:01:03.450> put<00:01:03.960> a<00:01:04.110> through<00:01:04.440> the<00:01:04.500> hamstring<00:01:04.949> so<00:01:05.309> I

00:01:05.329 --> 00:01:05.339 
and put a through the hamstring so I

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:06.800 
and put a through the hamstring so I
think<00:01:05.430> that's<00:01:05.640> a<00:01:05.729> really<00:01:06.210> key<00:01:06.390> element<00:01:06.420> which

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:06.810 
think that's a really key element which

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:08.180 
think that's a really key element which
one<00:01:07.020> to<00:01:07.110> try<00:01:07.320> and<00:01:07.440> junior<00:01:07.680> as<00:01:07.770> well<00:01:07.920> as<00:01:08.009> not

00:01:08.180 --> 00:01:08.190 
one to try and junior as well as not

00:01:08.190 --> 00:01:10.999 
one to try and junior as well as not
just<00:01:08.220> that<00:01:08.520> the<00:01:08.670> ability<00:01:09.000> to<00:01:09.860> accelerate<00:01:10.860> in

00:01:10.999 --> 00:01:11.009 
just that the ability to accelerate in

00:01:11.009 --> 00:01:19.130 
just that the ability to accelerate in
change<00:01:11.250> direction<00:01:11.640> hard<00:01:12.000> and<00:01:12.240> training<00:01:18.140> just

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:19.140 
change direction hard and training just

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:21.800 
change direction hard and training just
simply<00:01:20.009> can't<00:01:20.220> do<00:01:20.430> so<00:01:21.000> we<00:01:21.240> have<00:01:21.390> to<00:01:21.479> make<00:01:21.660> sure

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:21.810 
simply can't do so we have to make sure

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:25.190 
simply can't do so we have to make sure
that<00:01:21.930> he's<00:01:22.140> training<00:01:23.509> and<00:01:24.509> training<00:01:24.750> a<00:01:24.960> down

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:25.200 
that he's training and training a down

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:33.520 
that he's training and training a down
intensity<00:01:25.800> me<00:01:25.890> so<00:01:26.100> they<00:01:26.190> can<00:01:26.399> see<00:01:30.290> Franklin

00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:33.530 

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:36.230 

very<00:01:34.530> explosive<00:01:34.860> it<00:01:35.190> very<00:01:35.490> very<00:01:35.670> different<00:01:36.149> in

00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:36.240 
very explosive it very very different in

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:38.240 
very explosive it very very different in
the<00:01:36.300> way<00:01:36.420> that<00:01:36.450> they<00:01:36.750> move<00:01:36.959> in<00:01:37.740> see<00:01:38.009> here

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:38.250 
the way that they move in see here

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:40.999 
the way that they move in see here
bodies<00:01:39.179> position<00:01:39.780> there<00:01:39.929> he<00:01:40.050> lands<00:01:40.500> on<00:01:40.649> the

00:01:40.999 --> 00:01:41.009 
bodies position there he lands on the

00:01:41.009 --> 00:01:42.740 
bodies position there he lands on the
ground<00:01:41.190> landing<00:01:41.729> on<00:01:41.850> the<00:01:41.940> ball<00:01:42.119> of<00:01:42.360> his<00:01:42.420> foot

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:42.750 
ground landing on the ball of his foot

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:45.620 
ground landing on the ball of his foot
whereas<00:01:43.530> Cyril<00:01:43.920> over<00:01:44.640> here<00:01:44.850> is<00:01:44.970> gonna<00:01:45.090> land<00:01:45.360> on

00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:45.630 
whereas Cyril over here is gonna land on

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:47.300 
whereas Cyril over here is gonna land on
his<00:01:45.840> heel<00:01:46.080> so<00:01:46.380> a<00:01:46.440> lot<00:01:46.590> more<00:01:46.619> load<00:01:47.009> going

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:47.310 
his heel so a lot more load going

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:49.070 
his heel so a lot more load going
through<00:01:47.520> that<00:01:47.670> answering<00:01:48.119> resented<00:01:48.600> by<00:01:48.750> going

00:01:49.070 --> 00:01:49.080 
through that answering resented by going

00:01:49.080 --> 00:01:50.719 
through that answering resented by going
through<00:01:49.229> the<00:01:49.350> hamstring<00:01:49.800> secondly<00:01:50.459> you<00:01:50.610> can

00:01:50.719 --> 00:01:50.729 
through the hamstring secondly you can

00:01:50.729 --> 00:01:52.820 
through the hamstring secondly you can
see<00:01:50.940> how<00:01:51.270> far<00:01:51.569> out<00:01:51.810> under<00:01:52.440> your<00:01:52.470> center<00:01:52.740> of

00:01:52.820 --> 00:01:52.830 
see how far out under your center of

00:01:52.830 --> 00:01:57.109 
see how far out under your center of
gravity<00:01:52.920> bunny<00:01:53.490> is<00:01:53.869> the<00:01:55.640> center<00:01:56.640> of<00:01:56.759> gravity

00:01:57.109 --> 00:01:57.119 
gravity bunny is the center of gravity

00:01:57.119 --> 00:01:58.490 
gravity bunny is the center of gravity
so<00:01:57.149> a<00:01:57.300> lot<00:01:57.450> more<00:01:57.479> force<00:01:57.929> going<00:01:58.200> through<00:01:58.410> the

00:01:58.490 --> 00:01:58.500 
so a lot more force going through the

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:00.199 
so a lot more force going through the
hamstring<00:01:58.950> maybe<00:01:59.369> you<00:01:59.459> can<00:01:59.610> save<00:01:59.819> in<00:02:00.090> a

00:02:00.199 --> 00:02:00.209 
hamstring maybe you can save in a

00:02:00.209 --> 00:02:02.870 
hamstring maybe you can save in a
position<00:02:00.619> there<00:02:01.619> is<00:02:01.649> a<00:02:01.770> large<00:02:02.039> gap<00:02:02.459> a<00:02:02.640> large

00:02:02.870 --> 00:02:02.880 
position there is a large gap a large

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:05.359 
position there is a large gap a large
angle<00:02:03.270> between<00:02:03.450> the<00:02:03.780> two<00:02:03.990> sides<00:02:04.560> and<00:02:04.950> the<00:02:05.039> knee

00:02:05.359 --> 00:02:05.369 
angle between the two sides and the knee

00:02:05.369 --> 00:02:07.370 
angle between the two sides and the knee
and<00:02:05.670> also<00:02:06.149> you<00:02:06.240> can<00:02:06.330> see<00:02:06.509> how<00:02:06.720> fast<00:02:06.959> he<00:02:07.170> was

00:02:07.370 --> 00:02:07.380 
and also you can see how fast he was

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:09.680 
and also you can see how fast he was
fourth<00:02:07.709> he's<00:02:08.069> out<00:02:08.310> the<00:02:08.459> back<00:02:08.490> of<00:02:08.700> his<00:02:08.880> body<00:02:09.179> so

00:02:09.680 --> 00:02:09.690 
fourth he's out the back of his body so

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:12.830 
fourth he's out the back of his body so
it<00:02:09.810> makes<00:02:10.229> it<00:02:10.380> more<00:02:10.649> compact<00:02:11.270> so<00:02:12.270> in<00:02:12.450> this<00:02:12.569> left

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:12.840 
it makes it more compact so in this left
