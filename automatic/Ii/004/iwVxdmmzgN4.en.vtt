00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:44.720 
basic principles for lighting a fire
first<00:00:42.270> try<00:00:43.260> to<00:00:43.320> site<00:00:43.620> your<00:00:43.649> fire<00:00:44.070> where<00:00:44.610> you

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:44.730 
first try to site your fire where you

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:47.869 
first try to site your fire where you
have<00:00:44.910> access<00:00:45.090> to<00:00:45.840> fuel<00:00:46.399> very<00:00:47.399> important

preferably<00:01:03.960> made<00:01:04.170> of<00:01:04.619> dead<00:01:05.070> wood<00:01:05.280> this<00:01:05.970> has

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:06.210 
preferably made of dead wood this has

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:09.170 
preferably made of dead wood this has
several<00:01:06.420> purposes<00:01:07.280> first<00:01:08.280> when<00:01:08.820> I<00:01:08.850> put<00:01:09.060> this

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:09.180 
several purposes first when I put this

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:12.320 
several purposes first when I put this
platform<00:01:09.689> down<00:01:09.840> it'll<00:01:10.680> keep<00:01:10.860> my<00:01:11.760> tinder<00:01:12.180> and

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:12.330 
platform down it'll keep my tinder and

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:14.510 
platform down it'll keep my tinder and
my<00:01:12.450> kindling<00:01:12.930> away<00:01:13.619> from<00:01:13.860> moisture<00:01:14.100> on<00:01:14.430> the

00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:14.520 
my kindling away from moisture on the

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:16.719 
my kindling away from moisture on the
ground<00:01:14.549> particularly<00:01:15.150> if<00:01:15.360> it's<00:01:15.479> wet<00:01:15.689> weather

secondly<00:01:17.729> it<00:01:18.180> allows<00:01:18.210> air<00:01:18.720> to<00:01:18.930> come<00:01:19.110> in

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:19.170 
secondly it allows air to come in

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:22.670 
secondly it allows air to come in
underneath<00:01:19.650> and<00:01:20.549> helps<00:01:20.850> the<00:01:21.030> fire<00:01:21.330> to<00:01:21.509> burn<00:01:21.689> in

but when the temperatures drops to 50
below<00:01:32.610> that<00:01:33.240> can<00:01:33.450> make<00:01:33.600> the<00:01:33.720> difference

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:33.840 
below that can make the difference

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:36.140 
below that can make the difference
between<00:01:34.110> success<00:01:34.409> or<00:01:35.130> failure<00:01:35.670> at<00:01:35.880> fire

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:36.150 
between success or failure at fire

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:39.020 
between success or failure at fire
lighting<00:01:36.860> but<00:01:37.860> most<00:01:38.100> importantly<00:01:38.729> of<00:01:38.850> all

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:39.030 
lighting but most importantly of all

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:41.569 
lighting but most importantly of all
when<00:01:39.540> I<00:01:39.570> light<00:01:39.900> the<00:01:40.110> fire<00:01:40.350> these<00:01:40.920> logs<00:01:41.340> will

00:01:41.569 --> 00:01:41.579 
when I light the fire these logs will

00:01:41.579 --> 00:01:44.539 
when I light the fire these logs will
begin<00:01:41.939> to<00:01:42.090> burn<00:01:42.329> early<00:01:43.020> on<00:01:43.170> to<00:01:43.680> create<00:01:44.009> embers

00:01:44.539 --> 00:01:44.549 
begin to burn early on to create embers

00:01:44.549 --> 00:01:46.609 
begin to burn early on to create embers
and<00:01:44.729> a<00:01:44.790> good<00:01:45.030> heart<00:01:45.329> to<00:01:45.509> the<00:01:45.630> fire<00:01:45.840> that<00:01:46.350> makes

00:01:46.609 --> 00:01:46.619 
and a good heart to the fire that makes

00:01:46.619 --> 00:01:49.719 
and a good heart to the fire that makes
it<00:01:46.829> certain<00:01:47.369> to<00:01:47.520> start<00:01:47.820> and<00:01:48.000> light<00:01:48.180> properly

00:01:49.719 --> 00:01:49.729 
it certain to start and light properly

00:01:49.729 --> 00:01:54.020 
it certain to start and light properly
the<00:01:50.729> next<00:01:51.000> step<00:01:51.530> is<00:01:52.530> to<00:01:52.890> provide<00:01:53.549> a<00:01:53.729> set<00:01:54.000> of

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:54.030 
the next step is to provide a set of

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:56.779 
the next step is to provide a set of
kindling<00:01:54.659> little<00:01:55.350> thin<00:01:55.890> dead<00:01:56.189> twigs<00:01:56.520> like

00:01:56.779 --> 00:01:56.789 
kindling little thin dead twigs like

00:01:56.789 --> 00:01:59.270 
kindling little thin dead twigs like
this<00:01:57.030> we're<00:01:57.479> exactly<00:01:57.810> right<00:01:58.200> and<00:01:58.920> a<00:01:59.009> good

00:01:59.270 --> 00:01:59.280 
this we're exactly right and a good

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:01.310

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:22.309 
that's dry of fibrous dry grass dry bark
dry<00:02:19.920> moss<00:02:20.280> anything<00:02:21.150> like<00:02:21.300> that<00:02:21.330> but<00:02:22.140> one<00:02:22.290> of

00:02:22.309 --> 00:02:22.319 
dry moss anything like that but one of

00:02:22.319 --> 00:02:24.830 
dry moss anything like that but one of
the<00:02:22.500> best<00:02:22.739> things<00:02:23.010> of<00:02:23.190> all<00:02:23.370> is<00:02:23.610> birch<00:02:24.269> bark<00:02:24.569> and

00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:24.840 
the best things of all is birch bark and

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:26.990 
the best things of all is birch bark and
I've<00:02:24.930> got<00:02:25.080> an<00:02:25.170> old<00:02:25.349> rotten<00:02:25.980> log<00:02:26.370> here<00:02:26.670> you<00:02:26.880> can

00:02:26.990 --> 00:02:27.000 
I've got an old rotten log here you can

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:29.570 
I've got an old rotten log here you can
see<00:02:27.150> how<00:02:27.239> the<00:02:27.299> wood<00:02:27.510> has<00:02:27.630> rotted<00:02:28.250> but<00:02:29.250> not<00:02:29.430> the

00:02:29.570 --> 00:02:29.580 
see how the wood has rotted but not the

00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:31.940 
see how the wood has rotted but not the
bar<00:02:29.760> and<00:02:30.330> the<00:02:30.480> reason<00:02:30.810> for<00:02:30.959> that<00:02:31.110> is<00:02:31.680> that<00:02:31.739> the

00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:31.950 
bar and the reason for that is that the

00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:33.380 
bar and the reason for that is that the
bar<00:02:32.160> is<00:02:32.610> full<00:02:32.910> of<00:02:33.000> oil

00:02:33.380 --> 00:02:33.390 
bar is full of oil

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:34.970 
bar is full of oil
that's<00:02:33.750> preservative<00:02:34.260> and<00:02:34.380> that<00:02:34.470> all<00:02:34.590> burns

00:02:34.970 --> 00:02:34.980 
that's preservative and that all burns

00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:37.430 
that's preservative and that all burns
extremely<00:02:35.700> well<00:02:35.880> so<00:02:36.510> this<00:02:36.750> will<00:02:36.930> make<00:02:37.110> very

00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:37.440 
extremely well so this will make very

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:40.430 
extremely well so this will make very
good<00:02:37.530> tinder<00:02:38.250> to<00:02:38.640> fill<00:02:38.849> that<00:02:39.000> gap<00:02:39.319> and<00:02:40.319> I'll

00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:40.440 
good tinder to fill that gap and I'll

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:41.690 
good tinder to fill that gap and I'll
just<00:02:40.680> shred<00:02:41.010> that<00:02:41.190> down

00:02:41.690 --> 00:02:41.700 
just shred that down

00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:43.850 
just shred that down
so<00:02:41.970> it's<00:02:42.120> nice<00:02:42.299> and<00:02:42.329> thin<00:02:42.840> and<00:02:43.049> we'll<00:02:43.590> take

00:02:43.850 --> 00:02:43.860 
so it's nice and thin and we'll take

00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:46.819 
so it's nice and thin and we'll take
very<00:02:44.040> easily<00:02:44.489> from<00:02:45.239> the<00:02:45.510> small<00:02:46.349> flame<00:02:46.650> I'll

00:02:46.819 --> 00:02:46.829 
very easily from the small flame I'll

00:02:46.829 --> 00:03:12.630 
very easily from the small flame I'll
introduce<00:02:47.069> to<00:02:47.489> the<00:02:47.579> far<00:02:47.819> three<00:02:48.510> ignition

00:03:12.630 --> 00:03:12.640 

00:03:12.640 --> 00:03:17.050 

the<00:03:13.640> next<00:03:13.940> thing<00:03:14.120> is<00:03:14.360> to<00:03:14.420> get<00:03:14.690> ready<00:03:15.400> you'll<00:03:16.400> go

00:03:17.050 --> 00:03:17.060 
the next thing is to get ready you'll go

00:03:17.060 --> 00:03:19.000 
the next thing is to get ready you'll go
after<00:03:17.210> the<00:03:17.480> kindling<00:03:17.930> once<00:03:18.410> I<00:03:18.590> have<00:03:18.710> ignited

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:19.010 
after the kindling once I have ignited

00:03:19.010 --> 00:03:21.430 
after the kindling once I have ignited
the<00:03:19.310> kindling<00:03:19.700> this<00:03:20.690> goes<00:03:20.960> up<00:03:21.140> to<00:03:21.260> little

00:03:21.430 --> 00:03:21.440 
the kindling this goes up to little

00:03:21.440 --> 00:03:23.110 
the kindling this goes up to little
finger<00:03:21.800> thickness<00:03:22.190> I<00:03:22.370> won't<00:03:22.640> need<00:03:22.760> any<00:03:23.000> more

00:03:23.110 --> 00:03:23.120

birch bark and I have to prepare that
for<00:03:38.390> lighting<00:03:38.660> and<00:03:39.560> I<00:03:39.680> do<00:03:39.740> that<00:03:40.040> like<00:03:40.250> this

00:03:52.890 --> 00:03:52.900 

00:03:52.900 --> 00:03:56.260 

device<00:03:53.900> I<00:03:54.080> used<00:03:54.380> to<00:03:54.620> ignite<00:03:55.400> the<00:03:55.580> fire<00:03:55.820> is

00:03:56.260 --> 00:03:56.270

called a fire flash and it's an alloy of
metals<00:03:59.060> that<00:04:00.050> when<00:04:00.230> scraped<00:04:01.030> produces<00:04:02.030> bright

00:04:02.260 --> 00:04:02.270 
metals that when scraped produces bright

00:04:02.270 --> 00:04:04.840 
metals that when scraped produces bright
white<00:04:02.900> sparks<00:04:03.500> and<00:04:04.040> you<00:04:04.130> can<00:04:04.310> use<00:04:04.520> this<00:04:04.670> to

00:04:04.840 --> 00:04:04.850 
white sparks and you can use this to

00:04:04.850 --> 00:04:10.120 
white sparks and you can use this to
ignite<00:04:05.120> many<00:04:05.510> different<00:04:05.900> materials<00:04:08.980> the<00:04:09.980> way

I<00:04:10.160> use<00:04:10.580> it<00:04:10.790> as<00:04:11.360> I<00:04:11.540> place<00:04:11.840> it<00:04:12.050> on<00:04:12.200> the<00:04:12.470> bark<00:04:12.680> close

00:04:13.210 --> 00:04:13.220 
I use it as I place it on the bark close

00:04:13.220 --> 00:04:16.539 
I use it as I place it on the bark close
to<00:04:13.549> the<00:04:13.670> shavings<00:04:14.200> and<00:04:15.200> I<00:04:15.350> use<00:04:15.530> the<00:04:15.739> back<00:04:15.980> of<00:04:16.340> my

00:04:16.539 --> 00:04:16.549 
to the shavings and I use the back of my

00:04:16.549 --> 00:04:19.060 
to the shavings and I use the back of my
blade<00:04:16.880> close<00:04:17.390> to<00:04:17.630> the<00:04:17.720> point<00:04:18.019> I'll<00:04:18.799> show<00:04:19.010> you

00:04:19.060 --> 00:04:19.070 
blade close to the point I'll show you

00:04:30.540 --> 00:04:30.550 

00:04:30.550 --> 00:04:32.999 

so<00:04:31.509> what<00:04:31.599> I'll<00:04:31.780> do<00:04:31.960> now<00:04:32.110> is<00:04:32.139> drop<00:04:32.440> the<00:04:32.590> sparks

00:04:32.999 --> 00:04:33.009 
so what I'll do now is drop the sparks

00:04:33.009 --> 00:04:34.559 
so what I'll do now is drop the sparks
onto<00:04:33.250> these<00:04:33.370> shavings<00:04:33.669> when<00:04:34.240> they<00:04:34.360> catch

00:04:34.559 --> 00:04:34.569 
onto these shavings when they catch

00:04:34.569 --> 00:04:35.070 
onto these shavings when they catch

light

00:04:35.080 --> 00:04:37.290 
light
I'll<00:04:35.289> move<00:04:35.800> the<00:04:35.979> flames<00:04:36.280> in<00:04:36.789> under<00:04:37.180> the

00:04:37.290 --> 00:04:37.300 
I'll move the flames in under the

00:04:37.300 --> 00:05:00.629 
I'll move the flames in under the
kindling<00:04:58.530> while<00:04:59.530> the<00:04:59.650> fire<00:04:59.860> is<00:04:59.889> lighting<00:05:00.460> I

00:05:00.629 --> 00:05:00.639 
kindling while the fire is lighting I

00:05:00.639 --> 00:05:03.570 
kindling while the fire is lighting I
always<00:05:01.300> put<00:05:01.479> my<00:05:01.599> knife<00:05:01.810> and<00:05:02.199> my<00:05:02.979> fire<00:05:03.250> lighting

always put my knife and my fire lighting

00:05:03.580 --> 00:05:07.110 
always put my knife and my fire lighting
equipment<00:05:03.789> away<00:05:05.280> I've<00:05:06.280> got<00:05:06.310> a<00:05:06.520> few<00:05:06.729> moments

00:05:07.110 --> 00:05:07.120 
equipment away I've got a few moments

00:05:07.120 --> 00:05:09.110 
equipment away I've got a few moments
because<00:05:07.300> my<00:05:07.479> preparation<00:05:08.440> was<00:05:08.560> done<00:05:08.740> properly

00:05:09.110 --> 00:05:09.120 
because my preparation was done properly

00:05:09.120 --> 00:05:12.270 
because my preparation was done properly
once<00:05:10.120> the<00:05:10.240> flames<00:05:10.479> come<00:05:10.750> through<00:05:10.960> the<00:05:11.110> top<00:05:11.319> you
