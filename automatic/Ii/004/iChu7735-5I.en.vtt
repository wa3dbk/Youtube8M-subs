to<00:03:47.209> deploy<00:03:47.510> it<00:03:47.690> it's<00:03:47.900> basically<00:03:48.349> just<00:03:48.620> slide

00:03:49.059 --> 00:03:49.069 
to deploy it it's basically just slide

00:03:49.069 --> 00:03:51.250 
to deploy it it's basically just slide
this<00:03:49.250> forward<00:03:49.310> so<00:03:49.909> it's<00:03:50.060> very<00:03:50.239> intuitive<00:03:50.659> you

00:03:51.250 --> 00:03:51.260 
this forward so it's very intuitive you

00:03:51.260 --> 00:03:53.319

00:04:19.390 --> 00:04:19.400 
also makes changing the shield out very

00:04:19.400 --> 00:04:21.909 
also makes changing the shield out very
easy<00:04:19.699> there's<00:04:20.299> basically<00:04:20.720> a<00:04:20.840> trigger<00:04:21.199> on<00:04:21.440> each

00:04:21.909 --> 00:04:21.919 
easy there's basically a trigger on each

00:04:21.919 --> 00:04:25.689 
easy there's basically a trigger on each
side<00:04:22.250> where<00:04:23.090> if<00:04:23.210> you<00:04:23.330> pull<00:04:23.539> this<00:04:24.550> it's<00:04:25.550> going

00:04:25.689 --> 00:04:25.699 
side where if you pull this it's going

00:04:25.699 --> 00:04:29.379 
side where if you pull this it's going
to<00:04:25.759> basically<00:04:25.909> just<00:04:26.270> pop<00:04:26.479> right<00:04:26.690> out<00:04:27.009> and<00:04:28.389> then

00:04:29.379 --> 00:04:29.389 
to basically just pop right out and then

00:04:29.389 --> 00:04:32.529 
to basically just pop right out and then
to<00:04:30.320> reinstall<00:04:30.889> it<00:04:31.099> is<00:04:31.280> just<00:04:32.180> the<00:04:32.330> reverse

00:04:32.529 --> 00:04:32.539 
to reinstall it is just the reverse

00:04:32.539 --> 00:04:34.660 
to reinstall it is just the reverse
basically<00:04:33.110> you<00:04:33.169> just<00:04:33.380> slide<00:04:33.620> it<00:04:33.740> right<00:04:33.770> in<00:04:34.070> and

00:04:34.660 --> 00:04:34.670 
basically you just slide it right in and

00:04:34.670 --> 00:04:36.880 
basically you just slide it right in and
click<00:04:35.030> right<00:04:35.270> into<00:04:35.480> place<00:04:35.630> so<00:04:36.020> very<00:04:36.500> easy<00:04:36.710> to

00:04:36.880 --> 00:04:36.890 
click right into place so very easy to

00:04:36.890 --> 00:04:38.500 
click right into place so very easy to
swap<00:04:37.070> out<00:04:37.250> the<00:04:37.400> face<00:04:37.580> shields<00:04:37.910> if<00:04:38.060> you<00:04:38.270> chose

00:04:38.500 --> 00:04:38.510 
swap out the face shields if you chose

00:04:38.510 --> 00:04:40.270 
swap out the face shields if you chose
to<00:04:38.690> do<00:04:38.810> that<00:04:38.960> the<00:04:39.470> other<00:04:39.620> thing<00:04:39.830> I<00:04:39.920> want<00:04:40.070> you<00:04:40.190> to

notice<00:04:40.460> on<00:04:40.700> these<00:04:40.820> face<00:04:41.060> shields<00:04:41.390> is<00:04:41.630> these

00:04:41.860 --> 00:04:41.870 
notice on these face shields is these

00:04:41.870 --> 00:04:44.140 
notice on these face shields is these
little<00:04:42.140> pins<00:04:42.380> right<00:04:42.560> here<00:04:42.800> and<00:04:43.040> those<00:04:43.670> posts

00:04:44.140 --> 00:04:44.150 
little pins right here and those posts

00:04:44.150 --> 00:04:47.170 
little pins right here and those posts
are<00:04:44.210> actually<00:04:44.630> for<00:04:44.960> the<00:04:45.200> pin<00:04:45.380> lock<00:04:45.560> system<00:04:46.180> and

00:04:47.170 --> 00:04:47.180 
are actually for the pin lock system and

00:04:47.180 --> 00:04:49.690 
are actually for the pin lock system and
what<00:04:47.360> that<00:04:47.540> is<00:04:47.720> is<00:04:48.050> an<00:04:48.260> internal<00:04:48.860> layered

00:04:49.690 --> 00:04:49.700 
what that is is an internal layered

00:04:49.700 --> 00:04:51.700 
what that is is an internal layered
shield<00:04:50.210> that<00:04:50.630> you<00:04:50.720> can<00:04:50.870> install<00:04:51.230> between

00:04:51.700 --> 00:04:51.710 
shield that you can install between

00:04:51.710 --> 00:04:53.800 
shield that you can install between
those<00:04:51.860> pins<00:04:52.220> and<00:04:52.520> the<00:04:53.180> pin<00:04:53.330> lock<00:04:53.510> will

00:04:53.800 --> 00:04:53.810 
those pins and the pin lock will

00:04:53.810 --> 00:04:56.410 
those pins and the pin lock will
basically<00:04:54.710> create<00:04:55.040> a<00:04:55.070> seal<00:04:55.460> around<00:04:56.120> the

00:04:56.410 --> 00:04:56.420 
basically create a seal around the

00:04:56.420 --> 00:04:59.260 
basically create a seal around the
inside<00:04:56.750> of<00:04:57.140> the<00:04:57.620> face<00:04:58.610> shield<00:04:58.880> and<00:04:59.030> you'll<00:04:59.180> get

00:04:59.260 --> 00:04:59.270 
inside of the face shield and you'll get

00:04:59.270 --> 00:05:01.030 
inside of the face shield and you'll get
a<00:04:59.330> dual<00:04:59.540> paned<00:04:59.930> shield<00:05:00.290> now<00:05:00.500> what<00:05:00.650> that<00:05:00.800> does

00:05:01.030 --> 00:05:01.040 
a dual paned shield now what that does

00:05:01.040 --> 00:05:03.610 
a dual paned shield now what that does
is<00:05:01.190> it<00:05:01.670> is<00:05:01.820> very<00:05:02.210> effective<00:05:02.540> at<00:05:02.870> reducing<00:05:03.050> fog

00:05:03.610 --> 00:05:03.620 
is it is very effective at reducing fog

00:05:03.620 --> 00:05:05.890 
is it is very effective at reducing fog
so<00:05:03.860> if<00:05:03.950> you<00:05:04.100> ride<00:05:04.340> in<00:05:04.550> colder<00:05:05.210> conditions<00:05:05.360> or

00:05:05.890 --> 00:05:05.900 
so if you ride in colder conditions or

00:05:05.900 --> 00:05:07.750 
so if you ride in colder conditions or
wet<00:05:06.110> weather<00:05:06.350> where<00:05:06.890> fogging<00:05:07.160> becomes<00:05:07.610> an

00:05:07.750 --> 00:05:07.760 
wet weather where fogging becomes an

00:05:07.760 --> 00:05:09.970 
wet weather where fogging becomes an
issue<00:05:07.880> go<00:05:08.780> ahead<00:05:08.930> and<00:05:09.050> purchase<00:05:09.440> a<00:05:09.560> pin<00:05:09.830> lock

00:05:09.970 --> 00:05:09.980 
issue go ahead and purchase a pin lock

00:05:09.980 --> 00:05:11.620 
issue go ahead and purchase a pin lock

the cheek pads as well one thing I want
you<00:05:33.860> to<00:05:34.010> notice<00:05:34.220> remember<00:05:35.060> we<00:05:35.150> talked<00:05:35.360> about

00:05:35.440 --> 00:05:35.450 
you to notice remember we talked about

00:05:35.450 --> 00:05:38.740 
you to notice remember we talked about
that<00:05:35.600> chatterbox<00:05:36.200> system<00:05:36.620> they<00:05:37.250> build<00:05:38.240> in<00:05:38.480> a

00:05:38.740 --> 00:05:38.750 
that chatterbox system they build in a

00:05:38.750 --> 00:05:41.350 
that chatterbox system they build in a
little<00:05:39.140> mesh<00:05:39.410> panel<00:05:39.950> right<00:05:40.850> where<00:05:41.030> your<00:05:41.180> ears

00:05:41.350 --> 00:05:41.360 
little mesh panel right where your ears

00:05:41.360 --> 00:05:43.120 
little mesh panel right where your ears
would<00:05:41.570> sit<00:05:41.810> so<00:05:42.200> you<00:05:42.230> don't<00:05:42.410> have<00:05:42.530> any<00:05:42.770> extra

00:05:43.120 --> 00:05:43.130 
would sit so you don't have any extra

00:05:43.130 --> 00:05:45.100 
would sit so you don't have any extra
material<00:05:43.730> sitting<00:05:44.000> between<00:05:44.240> your<00:05:44.600> ear<00:05:44.870> and

00:05:45.100 --> 00:05:45.110 
material sitting between your ear and

00:05:45.110 --> 00:05:47.680 
material sitting between your ear and
the<00:05:45.500> speaker<00:05:45.860> that<00:05:46.040> you<00:05:46.100> can<00:05:46.250> install<00:05:46.690> and

00:05:47.680 --> 00:05:47.690 
the speaker that you can install and

00:05:47.690 --> 00:05:50.650 
the speaker that you can install and
that<00:05:48.140> also<00:05:48.290> prevents<00:05:49.220> any<00:05:49.700> discomfort<00:05:50.210> since

00:05:50.650 --> 00:05:50.660 
that also prevents any discomfort since

00:05:50.660 --> 00:05:52.060 
that also prevents any discomfort since
you<00:05:50.840> don't<00:05:50.930> have<00:05:51.020> a<00:05:51.140> thick<00:05:51.410> layer<00:05:51.590> of<00:05:51.770> material

00:05:52.060 --> 00:05:52.070 
you don't have a thick layer of material

00:05:52.070 --> 00:05:53.740 
you don't have a thick layer of material
there<00:05:52.520> it's<00:05:52.670> not<00:05:52.820> going<00:05:53.000> to<00:05:53.060> press<00:05:53.240> up<00:05:53.270> against

00:05:53.740 --> 00:05:53.750 
there it's not going to press up against

00:05:53.750 --> 00:05:55.360 
there it's not going to press up against
your<00:05:53.870> ear<00:05:54.080> when<00:05:54.620> you<00:05:54.710> have<00:05:54.860> the<00:05:55.010> speaker

00:05:55.360 --> 00:05:55.370 
your ear when you have the speaker

00:05:55.370 --> 00:06:00.010 
your ear when you have the speaker
installed<00:05:55.840> actually<00:05:56.840> if<00:05:56.930> you<00:05:57.020> take<00:05:57.230> a<00:05:57.290> look<00:05:59.020> at

00:06:00.010 --> 00:06:00.020 
installed actually if you take a look at

00:06:00.020 --> 00:06:01.690 
installed actually if you take a look at
the<00:06:00.350> side<00:06:00.530> here<00:06:00.830> you<00:06:00.860> can<00:06:01.010> see<00:06:01.340> that<00:06:01.520> there's

00:06:01.690 --> 00:06:01.700 
the side here you can see that there's

00:06:01.700 --> 00:06:04.090 
the side here you can see that there's
plenty<00:06:02.060> of<00:06:02.090> room<00:06:02.360> there<00:06:02.630> to<00:06:02.810> run<00:06:03.410> wires<00:06:03.680> and

00:06:04.090 --> 00:06:04.100 
plenty of room there to run wires and

00:06:04.100 --> 00:06:05.530 
plenty of room there to run wires and
that's<00:06:04.730> basically<00:06:05.060> right<00:06:05.300> where<00:06:05.450> the

00:06:05.530 --> 00:06:05.540 
that's basically right where the

00:06:05.540 --> 00:06:08.710 
that's basically right where the
chatterbox<00:06:05.990> unit<00:06:06.490> installs<00:06:07.490> so<00:06:08.360> you<00:06:08.450> can<00:06:08.570> see

00:06:08.710 --> 00:06:08.720 
chatterbox unit installs so you can see

00:06:08.720 --> 00:06:13.420 
chatterbox unit installs so you can see
that<00:06:08.870> area<00:06:09.110> right<00:06:09.350> there<00:06:12.220> go<00:06:13.220> ahead<00:06:13.340> and

00:06:13.420 --> 00:06:13.430 
that area right there go ahead and

00:06:13.430 --> 00:06:14.950 
that area right there go ahead and
remove<00:06:13.520> the<00:06:13.760> rest<00:06:13.880> of<00:06:14.060> the<00:06:14.120> interior<00:06:14.540> the

00:06:14.950 --> 00:06:14.960 
remove the rest of the interior the

00:06:14.960 --> 00:06:16.600 
remove the rest of the interior the
cheek<00:06:15.140> pads<00:06:15.320> basically<00:06:15.770> just<00:06:15.920> have<00:06:16.070> two<00:06:16.280> snaps

00:06:16.600 --> 00:06:16.610 
cheek pads basically just have two snaps

00:06:16.610 --> 00:06:17.920 
cheek pads basically just have two snaps
and<00:06:16.820> then<00:06:16.910> a<00:06:16.940> little<00:06:17.090> bit<00:06:17.210> of<00:06:17.360> velcro<00:06:17.510> and<00:06:17.750> they

00:06:17.920 --> 00:06:17.930 
and then a little bit of velcro and they

00:06:17.930 --> 00:06:19.680 
and then a little bit of velcro and they
come<00:06:18.170> right<00:06:18.320> out

00:06:19.680 --> 00:06:19.690 
come right out

00:06:19.690 --> 00:06:23.100 
come right out
you<00:06:20.690> can<00:06:20.870> open<00:06:21.110> that<00:06:21.260> chin<00:06:21.830> bar<00:06:22.010> as<00:06:22.100> well<00:06:22.280> and

00:06:23.100 --> 00:06:23.110 
you can open that chin bar as well and

00:06:23.110 --> 00:06:25.360 
you can open that chin bar as well and
then<00:06:24.110> the<00:06:24.200> crown<00:06:24.410> liner<00:06:24.680> is<00:06:24.920> just<00:06:25.100> a<00:06:25.190> couple

00:06:25.360 --> 00:06:25.370 
then the crown liner is just a couple

00:06:25.370 --> 00:06:27.990 
then the crown liner is just a couple
snaps<00:06:25.730> around<00:06:26.450> the<00:06:26.750> front<00:06:26.990> and<00:06:27.200> the<00:06:27.320> back<00:06:27.470> and

00:06:27.990 --> 00:06:28.000 
snaps around the front and the back and

00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:29.950 
snaps around the front and the back and
that's<00:06:29.000> going<00:06:29.150> to<00:06:29.210> come<00:06:29.360> right<00:06:29.510> out<00:06:29.570> as<00:06:29.810> well

00:06:29.950 --> 00:06:29.960 
that's going to come right out as well

00:06:29.960 --> 00:06:31.120 
that's going to come right out as well
and<00:06:30.140> you'll<00:06:30.230> see<00:06:30.440> that<00:06:30.560> they<00:06:30.680> use<00:06:30.830> a<00:06:30.860> lot<00:06:31.100> of

00:06:31.120 --> 00:06:31.130 
and you'll see that they use a lot of

00:06:31.130 --> 00:06:35.170 
and you'll see that they use a lot of
mesh<00:06:31.460> material<00:06:32.330> on<00:06:32.930> the<00:06:33.770> crown<00:06:34.580> liner<00:06:34.820> as<00:06:35.000> well

00:06:35.170 --> 00:06:35.180 
mesh material on the crown liner as well

00:06:35.180 --> 00:06:37.180 
mesh material on the crown liner as well
and<00:06:35.330> that's<00:06:35.450> also<00:06:35.630> the<00:06:35.870> silver<00:06:36.230> cool<00:06:36.440> moisture

00:06:37.180 --> 00:06:37.190 
and that's also the silver cool moisture

00:06:37.190 --> 00:06:38.730 
and that's also the silver cool moisture
wicking<00:06:37.340> fabric<00:06:37.460> to<00:06:38.030> keep<00:06:38.150> you<00:06:38.270> comfortable

00:06:38.730 --> 00:06:38.740 
wicking fabric to keep you comfortable

00:06:38.740 --> 00:06:40.900 
wicking fabric to keep you comfortable
we<00:06:39.740> talked<00:06:39.950> about<00:06:40.070> the<00:06:40.250> channeling<00:06:40.670> for<00:06:40.700> the

00:06:40.900 --> 00:06:40.910 
we talked about the channeling for the

00:06:40.910 --> 00:06:43.570 
we talked about the channeling for the
ventilation<00:06:41.510> you<00:06:41.990> can<00:06:42.140> see<00:06:42.380> where<00:06:42.980> they<00:06:43.370> have

00:06:43.570 --> 00:06:43.580 
ventilation you can see where they have

00:06:43.580 --> 00:06:45.610 
ventilation you can see where they have
air<00:06:43.850> passages<00:06:44.330> built<00:06:44.570> into<00:06:44.900> the<00:06:45.020> liner<00:06:45.260> and

00:06:45.610 --> 00:06:45.620 
air passages built into the liner and

00:06:45.620 --> 00:06:47.200 
air passages built into the liner and
then<00:06:45.740> some<00:06:45.920> multi<00:06:46.160> density<00:06:46.340> EPS

00:06:47.200 --> 00:06:47.210 
then some multi density EPS

00:06:47.210 --> 00:06:48.610 
then some multi density EPS
which<00:06:47.360> is<00:06:47.479> going<00:06:47.569> to<00:06:47.630> progressively<00:06:48.199> absorb

00:06:48.610 --> 00:06:48.620 
which is going to progressively absorb

00:06:48.620 --> 00:06:52.480 
which is going to progressively absorb
impact<00:06:49.069> and<00:06:49.280> that<00:06:50.710> air<00:06:51.710> is<00:06:51.740> going<00:06:51.949> to<00:06:52.130> come<00:06:52.340> in

00:06:52.480 --> 00:06:52.490 
impact and that air is going to come in

00:06:52.490 --> 00:06:54.279 
impact and that air is going to come in
through<00:06:52.639> these<00:06:52.970> two<00:06:53.210> holes<00:06:53.449> at<00:06:53.600> the<00:06:53.690> top<00:06:53.870> have

00:06:54.279 --> 00:06:54.289 
through these two holes at the top have

00:06:54.289 --> 00:06:56.710 
through these two holes at the top have
places<00:06:54.680> to<00:06:54.800> go<00:06:54.949> and<00:06:55.100> an<00:06:55.639> area<00:06:56.210> for<00:06:56.389> it<00:06:56.630> to

00:06:56.710 --> 00:06:56.720 
places to go and an area for it to

00:06:56.720 --> 00:06:58.240 
places to go and an area for it to
escape<00:06:57.050> out<00:06:57.319> the<00:06:57.500> back<00:06:57.650> of<00:06:57.680> the<00:06:57.860> helmet<00:06:58.160> as

00:06:58.240 --> 00:06:58.250 
escape out the back of the helmet as

00:06:58.250 --> 00:07:06.820 
escape out the back of the helmet as
well<00:07:03.639> so<00:07:04.639> if<00:07:04.729> you're<00:07:04.910> a<00:07:04.940> touring<00:07:05.539> rider<00:07:05.830> who
