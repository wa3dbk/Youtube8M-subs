feral cats and things like that and I

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:27.230 
feral cats and things like that and I
think<00:00:25.439> the<00:00:25.680> information<00:00:25.800> will<00:00:26.189> be<00:00:26.310> useful<00:00:26.519> for

00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:27.240 
think the information will be useful for

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:29.570 
think the information will be useful for
a<00:00:27.269> lot<00:00:27.330> of<00:00:27.599> people<00:00:27.930> but<00:00:28.769> I<00:00:28.800> got<00:00:28.980> an<00:00:29.099> email<00:00:29.220> this

that<00:00:36.360> is<00:00:36.899> is<00:00:37.590> likely<00:00:37.890> quite<00:00:38.250> common<00:00:38.760> in

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:38.940 
that is is likely quite common in

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:44.760 
could do a lot of damage to a fish

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:46.910 
could do a lot of damage to a fish
population<00:00:45.390> in<00:00:45.480> a<00:00:45.600> pond<00:00:45.840> and<00:00:46.110> that<00:00:46.140> is<00:00:46.440> mink

population in a pond and that is mink
mink<00:00:48.110> never<00:00:49.110> would<00:00:49.289> have<00:00:49.350> thought<00:00:49.410> of<00:00:49.680> that

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:49.770 
mink never would have thought of that

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:52.850 
mink never would have thought of that
myself<00:00:50.570> the<00:00:51.570> thing<00:00:51.780> about<00:00:51.989> this<00:00:52.469> type<00:00:52.680> of

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:52.860 
myself the thing about this type of

00:00:57.740 --> 00:00:57.750 
thought about it except for the fact

00:00:57.750 --> 00:00:59.479 
thought about it except for the fact
that<00:00:57.840> he<00:00:57.960> saw<00:00:58.170> one<00:00:58.379> slip<00:00:58.710> in<00:00:58.829> his<00:00:58.949> pond<00:00:59.219> one

afternoon<00:01:00.680> the<00:01:01.680> the<00:01:02.100> interesting<00:01:02.430> thing

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:02.850 
afternoon the the interesting thing

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:04.280 
afternoon the the interesting thing
about<00:01:02.879> mink<00:01:03.359> having<00:01:03.690> done<00:01:03.840> a<00:01:03.870> little<00:01:04.049> more

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:04.290 
about mink having done a little more

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:05.960 
about mink having done a little more
research<00:01:04.619> on<00:01:04.920> this<00:01:05.159> is<00:01:05.460> that<00:01:05.670> they<00:01:05.850> are

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:05.970 
research on this is that they are

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:08.590 
research on this is that they are
actually<00:01:06.150> related<00:01:06.780> to<00:01:06.869> the<00:01:06.990> otter<00:01:07.140> family

00:01:08.590 --> 00:01:08.600 
actually related to the otter family

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:12.260 
actually related to the otter family
same<00:01:09.600> same<00:01:10.080> genus<00:01:10.530> so<00:01:11.340> they<00:01:11.700> love<00:01:11.909> the<00:01:12.060> water

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:12.270 
same same genus so they love the water

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:13.880 
same same genus so they love the water
they're<00:01:12.600> very<00:01:12.840> comfortable<00:01:13.140> swimming<00:01:13.560> can

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:13.890 
they're very comfortable swimming can

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:16.840 
they're very comfortable swimming can
swim<00:01:14.100> underwater<00:01:14.430> and<00:01:14.790> they<00:01:15.090> like<00:01:15.299> fish<00:01:15.600> and

00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:16.850 
swim underwater and they like fish and

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:20.420 
swim underwater and they like fish and
chances<00:01:17.850> are<00:01:18.090> that<00:01:18.420> if<00:01:19.259> you<00:01:19.500> have<00:01:19.830> ruled<00:01:20.159> out<00:01:20.369> a

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:20.430 
chances are that if you have ruled out a

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:22.010 
chances are that if you have ruled out a
lot<00:01:20.880> of<00:01:20.909> these<00:01:21.150> other<00:01:21.390> species

00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:22.020 
lot of these other species

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:24.859 
lot of these other species
nothing<00:01:22.650> is<00:01:22.770> seemingly<00:01:23.130> obvious<00:01:23.400> to<00:01:23.939> you<00:01:24.330> mink

00:01:24.859 --> 00:01:24.869 
nothing is seemingly obvious to you mink

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:27.410 
nothing is seemingly obvious to you mink
may<00:01:25.110> be<00:01:25.170> a<00:01:25.350> consideration<00:01:26.180> something<00:01:27.180> to<00:01:27.270> look

00:01:27.410 --> 00:01:27.420 
may be a consideration something to look

but you know if you're if you're in
doubt<00:01:38.430> of<00:01:38.670> what<00:01:38.820> could<00:01:39.030> be<00:01:39.119> causing<00:01:39.360> problems

00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:40.250 
doubt of what could be causing problems

00:01:40.250 --> 00:01:42.770 
doubt of what could be causing problems
it<00:01:41.250> might<00:01:41.490> be<00:01:41.640> a<00:01:41.670> good<00:01:41.820> idea<00:01:41.880> to<00:01:42.210> set<00:01:42.420> up<00:01:42.509> a<00:01:42.570> live

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:42.780 
it might be a good idea to set up a live

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:45.980 
it might be a good idea to set up a live
capture<00:01:43.399> there's<00:01:44.399> really<00:01:44.579> only<00:01:44.670> two<00:01:44.880> I<00:01:45.329> think

00:01:45.980 --> 00:01:45.990 
capture there's really only two I think

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:48.380 
capture there's really only two I think
workable<00:01:46.409> solutions<00:01:46.979> maybe<00:01:47.159> three<00:01:47.610> where<00:01:48.270> it

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:48.390 
workable solutions maybe three where it

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:50.319 
workable solutions maybe three where it
comes<00:01:48.600> to<00:01:48.780> make<00:01:48.960> you<00:01:49.140> could<00:01:49.380> use<00:01:49.590> a<00:01:49.829> very

00:01:50.319 --> 00:01:50.329 
comes to make you could use a very

may be useful I'm not even sure if this

shocked by totally and that is you know
he<00:02:39.780> said<00:02:39.990> mark<00:02:40.200> like<00:02:40.410> me<00:02:40.620> you<00:02:40.890> have<00:02:41.040> a<00:02:41.100> face

00:02:45.979 --> 00:02:45.989 
made for radio and I thought about it

00:02:45.989 --> 00:02:47.390 
made for radio and I thought about it
for<00:02:46.110> a<00:02:46.200> minute<00:02:46.290> and<00:02:46.650> you<00:02:46.709> know<00:02:46.920> in<00:02:47.040> my<00:02:47.160> younger

00:02:47.390 --> 00:02:47.400 
for a minute and you know in my younger

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:49.310 
for a minute and you know in my younger
days<00:02:47.520> I<00:02:47.850> would<00:02:48.030> have<00:02:48.060> probably<00:02:48.320> ignorantly

00:02:49.310 --> 00:02:49.320 
days I would have probably ignorantly

00:02:49.320 --> 00:02:52.820 
days I would have probably ignorantly
taken<00:02:49.680> that<00:02:49.770> as<00:02:49.920> a<00:02:49.950> compliment<00:02:50.580> but<00:02:51.120> I<00:02:51.780> got<00:02:52.739> to

00:02:52.820 --> 00:02:52.830 
taken that as a compliment but I got to

00:02:52.830 --> 00:02:54.170 
taken that as a compliment but I got to
thinking<00:02:53.100> about<00:02:53.130> it<00:02:53.310> I<00:02:53.459> thought<00:02:53.640> well<00:02:53.850> you

00:02:54.170 --> 00:02:54.180 
thinking about it I thought well you

00:02:54.180 --> 00:02:55.970 
thinking about it I thought well you
know<00:02:54.270> have<00:02:54.450> I<00:02:54.480> really<00:02:54.840> slipped<00:02:55.260> that<00:02:55.410> far<00:02:55.709> and

00:02:55.970 --> 00:02:55.980
