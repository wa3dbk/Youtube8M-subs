00:00:08.920 --> 00:00:15.769
 cheese and today I will tell about how they brought 

00:00:11.750 --> 00:00:18.619
 tank 110 and 4 will be released this car always 

00:00:15.769 --> 00:00:21.080
 inferior to the popularity of 110 e3 due to 

00:00:18.619 --> 00:00:23.419
 a weaker couple without seeing this 

00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:25.270
 video you will understand why the popularity of e4 

00:00:23.419 --> 00:00:27.619
 will fall even more 

00:00:25.270 --> 00:00:29.270
 job modeler when translating machine 

00:00:27.619 --> 00:00:32.390
 chiefs can sometimes lead to an increase 

00:00:29.270 --> 00:00:33.980
 verge and and weakening weakening 

00:00:32.390 --> 00:00:35.870
 may be due to insufficient reason 

00:00:33.980 --> 00:00:37.399
 painstaking handling of the model 

00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:39.829
 and because of processing 

00:00:37.399 --> 00:00:42.500
 booking machine nodes and here you are 

00:00:39.829 --> 00:00:45.289
 found for both these problems and which one 

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:49.850
 fatal for t110 e4 

00:00:45.289 --> 00:00:52.370
 let's understand booking 099 nld 

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:55.070
 120 millimeters of armor with a slope of 47 

00:00:52.370 --> 00:00:56.929
 degrees in the center is given to 100 76 

00:00:55.070 --> 00:01:01.579
 millimeters on the left is given to 

00:00:56.929 --> 00:01:03.829
 143,145 millimeters and on the right 152,154 

00:01:01.579 --> 00:01:05.840
 that is, not only weakened the edges and but for 

00:01:03.829 --> 00:01:08.810
 compared to the previous version of the machine on 

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:11.060
 20 meters but because of the model or crooked so 

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:16.190
 like 98 such a talk tits and armor not 

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:19.490
 there was a central strip separating 

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:21.920
 nld and vld 260 millimeters of armor is given 

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:26.000
 to in the center immediately on top of 317 millimeters 

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:26.720
 and in other places even more vld consists 

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:29.030
 from 3 lanes 

00:01:26.720 --> 00:01:31.340
 260 meters at the beginning of this completion 

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:33.170
 the central band further 210 

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:34.760
 millimeter floor pine put 53 

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:37.250
 degrees and led to three hundred forty nine 

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:39.050
 millimeters top vld 180 

00:01:37.250 --> 00:01:41.600
 millimeter armor plate with reduced to and 

00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:43.370
 three hundred and sixty millimeters in hd 

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:45.020
 model test sheet four models pa 

00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:46.400
 reworked the booking scheme 

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:49.310
 tower turning mechanism 

00:01:46.400 --> 00:01:50.540
 if previously there was 150 two-millimeter 

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:52.640
 sheet given to and one hundred and sixty nine 

00:01:50.540 --> 00:01:55.820
 millimeters by now there is 76 millimeters 

00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:57.680
 armor with a slope of 72 degrees and led 

00:01:55.820 --> 00:02:00.860
 to two hundred and forty six millimeters 

00:01:57.680 --> 00:02:02.960
 it would seem a solid booking 

00:02:00.860 --> 00:02:04.780
 but the features of the model are now sort of 

00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:08.269
 dealing damage through ricochete mechanics 

00:02:04.780 --> 00:02:09.030
 and 150 millimeters is more than 

00:02:08.269 --> 00:02:11.700
 enough 

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:14.790
 causing machine damage to level 10 

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:17.220
 frontal projection yes what to say if 

00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:20.810
 you are shelling and without was 9 all shells 

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:23.550
 passed into this zone damage with damage Carl 

00:02:20.810 --> 00:02:25.230
 own in 98 such a problem was 

00:02:23.550 --> 00:02:26.520
 however hope for improvement 

00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:29.730
 it was but 

00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:33.200
 Gabriel Angelos, now different 

00:02:29.730 --> 00:02:35.640
 from this machine is more than understandable 

00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:37.770
 mask gun two hundred fifty four 

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:40.200
 millimeter bronies tilt one degree a 

00:02:37.770 --> 00:02:43.610
 behind the mask is a large plot with 0 

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:43.610
 armor nothing has changed here 

00:03:01.060 --> 00:03:04.880
 forehead felling 

00:03:02.570 --> 00:03:07.400
 a strip of armor appeared above the mask 

00:03:04.880 --> 00:03:09.890
 300 millimeters but what's the point 

00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:12.200
 if you gun font with problem 150 

00:03:09.890 --> 00:03:14.360
 millimeters main defensive barb 

00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:15.980
 203 millimeters in steel armor 100 leads to 

00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:19.520
 from two hundred thirty two millimeters 

00:03:15.980 --> 00:03:21.470
 nothing has changed here turret 152 

00:03:19.520 --> 00:03:26.570
 millimeter baranets held kai 247 

00:03:21.470 --> 00:03:29.390
 millimeters from above and 236 from below bor 

00:03:26.570 --> 00:03:31.790
 tubes of 152 millimeters with a slope of 25 

00:03:29.390 --> 00:03:35.240
 brought to 168 here added a couple 

00:03:31.790 --> 00:03:38.240
 millimeters is given ki hand feed 152 

00:03:35.240 --> 00:03:40.550
 millimeter and 158 reduced to nothing 

00:03:38.240 --> 00:03:42.290
 the hull sides have changed 

00:03:40.550 --> 00:03:44.810
 consist of a plot of hidden between 

00:03:42.290 --> 00:03:47.120
 caterpillars there are 44 millimeters with a slope 

00:03:44.810 --> 00:03:48.260
 43 is about 60 millimeters 

00:03:47.120 --> 00:03:51.560
 reduced armor 

00:03:48.260 --> 00:03:54.170
 cut 2 millimeters into it without something 

00:03:51.560 --> 00:03:54.650
 changes there are 76 millimeters with zero 

00:03:54.170 --> 00:03:57.620
 slope 

00:03:54.650 --> 00:04:00.530
 Yes, and on the stern, too, everything is exactly 38 

00:03:57.620 --> 00:04:03.440
 millimeters as before we sum up 

00:04:00.530 --> 00:04:06.080
 if you want to confidently punch t110 4 then 

00:04:03.440 --> 00:04:07.070
 shoot at the top of the wind if the edges are nld 

00:04:06.080 --> 00:04:08.600
 unavailable 

00:04:07.070 --> 00:04:10.520
 if you talk about quality 

00:04:08.600 --> 00:04:12.709
 transferring the booking model to hd 

00:04:10.520 --> 00:04:14.570
 the version is unsatisfactory 

00:04:12.709 --> 00:04:17.359
 This unit has received new vulnerabilities 

00:04:14.570 --> 00:04:20.299
 in the frontal projection of the hull and the old ones 

00:04:17.359 --> 00:04:22.430
 bloomed with new power let's hope 

00:04:20.299 --> 00:04:25.280
 that developers will see this video and 

00:04:22.430 --> 00:04:27.440
 will take steps to fix this decent 

00:04:25.280 --> 00:04:29.000
 cars like this 

00:04:27.440 --> 00:04:30.860
 subscribe to my channel link to 

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:33.910
 he is in the description and on the channel from funk 

00:04:30.860 --> 00:04:33.910
 bye bye
