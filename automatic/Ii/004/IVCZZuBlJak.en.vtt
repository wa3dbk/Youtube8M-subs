Vorbis<00:02:00.700> file<00:02:01.170> not<00:02:02.170> sure<00:02:02.320> how<00:02:02.500> you're<00:02:02.649> going<00:02:02.799> to

00:02:02.910 --> 00:02:02.920 
Vorbis file not sure how you're going to

00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:06.240 
Vorbis file not sure how you're going to
do<00:02:03.070> that<00:02:04.020> just<00:02:05.020> say<00:02:05.170> for<00:02:05.560> instance<00:02:05.619> if<00:02:05.979> you<00:02:06.100> use

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:06.250 
do that just say for instance if you use

00:02:06.250 --> 00:02:08.130 
do that just say for instance if you use
it<00:02:06.399> from<00:02:06.549> program<00:02:07.000> you<00:02:07.149> need<00:02:07.240> to<00:02:07.329> convert<00:02:07.630> just

00:02:08.130 --> 00:02:08.140 
it from program you need to convert just

00:02:08.140 --> 00:02:11.220 
it from program you need to convert just
so<00:02:08.259> for<00:02:08.440> instant<00:02:08.710> mp3<00:02:09.250> to<00:02:09.460> OGG<00:02:09.930> so<00:02:10.930> you<00:02:11.020> need<00:02:11.140> to

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:11.230 
so for instant mp3 to OGG so you need to

00:02:11.230 --> 00:02:12.660 
so for instant mp3 to OGG so you need to
do<00:02:11.350> that<00:02:11.500> otherwise<00:02:11.710> minecraft<00:02:12.250> can't<00:02:12.490> play

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:12.670 
do that otherwise minecraft can't play

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:15.850 
do that otherwise minecraft can't play
it<00:02:12.700> so<00:02:13.090> you<00:02:13.420> need<00:02:13.510> to<00:02:13.540> save<00:02:13.840> it<00:02:13.990> as<00:02:14.110> Pig<00:02:14.860> death

00:02:15.850 --> 00:02:15.860

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:17.380 
it so you need to save it as Pig death
I'm<00:02:16.550> just<00:02:16.730> going<00:02:16.850> to<00:02:16.910> say<00:02:17.090> that<00:02:17.120> to<00:02:17.300> the

00:02:17.380 --> 00:02:17.390 
I'm just going to say that to the

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:21.070 
I'm just going to say that to the
desktop<00:02:18.340> save<00:02:19.340> then<00:02:20.150> which<00:02:20.300> you<00:02:20.480> have<00:02:20.810> to<00:02:20.960> go

00:02:21.070 --> 00:02:21.080 
desktop save then which you have to go

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:22.690 
desktop save then which you have to go
to<00:02:21.140> the<00:02:21.560> desktop<00:02:21.710> and<00:02:22.130> actually<00:02:22.430> find<00:02:22.640> that

00:02:22.690 --> 00:02:22.700 
to the desktop and actually find that

00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:26.920 
to the desktop and actually find that
file<00:02:23.440> or<00:02:24.440> is<00:02:24.590> that<00:02:24.710> file<00:02:25.070> there<00:02:25.820> it<00:02:25.940> is<00:02:26.060> copy

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:26.930 
file or is that file there it is copy

00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:28.510 
file or is that file there it is copy
that<00:02:27.110> file<00:02:27.350> now<00:02:27.800> you<00:02:27.860> have<00:02:28.010> to<00:02:28.130> paste<00:02:28.370> that

00:02:28.510 --> 00:02:28.520 
that file now you have to paste that

00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:33.420 
that file now you have to paste that
into<00:02:30.340> the<00:02:31.340> file<00:02:31.640> with<00:02:31.970> the<00:02:32.000> pig<00:02:32.300> death<00:02:32.510> sound

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:33.430 
into the file with the pig death sound

00:02:33.430 --> 00:02:37.050 
into the file with the pig death sound
so<00:02:34.430> it<00:02:35.240> likes<00:02:35.420> you<00:02:35.570> to<00:02:35.690> modify<00:02:35.960> it<00:02:36.140> you<00:02:36.410> say<00:02:36.560> yes

00:02:37.050 --> 00:02:37.060 
so it likes you to modify it you say yes

00:02:37.060 --> 00:02:39.100 
so it likes you to modify it you say yes
so<00:02:38.060> now<00:02:38.180> that's<00:02:38.330> done<00:02:38.480> you<00:02:38.630> go<00:02:38.750> back<00:02:38.900> to

00:02:39.100 --> 00:02:39.110 
so now that's done you go back to

00:02:39.110 --> 00:02:41.949 
so now that's done you go back to
minecraft<00:02:39.350> and<00:02:39.890> now<00:02:40.280> we<00:02:40.340> have<00:02:40.490> to<00:02:40.610> find<00:02:40.850> a<00:02:41.150> pig
