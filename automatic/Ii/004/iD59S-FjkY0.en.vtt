them and also the extra opportunities as

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:23.990 
them and also the extra opportunities as
well<00:00:22.199> I've<00:00:22.529> had<00:00:22.830> a<00:00:22.859> chance<00:00:23.130> to<00:00:23.310> be<00:00:23.760> involved

00:00:23.990 --> 00:00:24.000 
well I've had a chance to be involved

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.179 
well I've had a chance to be involved
with<00:00:24.359> the<00:00:24.510> student<00:00:24.869> company<00:00:25.320> so<00:00:25.590> I<00:00:25.619> develop

00:00:26.179 --> 00:00:26.189 
with the student company so I develop

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:28.130 
with the student company so I develop
software<00:00:26.400> so<00:00:27.210> what's<00:00:27.330> running<00:00:27.480> behind<00:00:27.689> me<00:00:27.990> is

00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:28.140 
software so what's running behind me is

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:30.140 
software so what's running behind me is
my<00:00:28.380> graphics<00:00:28.949> coursework<00:00:29.429> that<00:00:29.490> I<00:00:29.730> produced

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:30.150 
my graphics coursework that I produced

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:31.820 
my graphics coursework that I produced
for<00:00:30.300> the<00:00:30.330> graphics<00:00:30.720> module<00:00:31.080> I<00:00:31.199> have<00:00:31.410> had<00:00:31.800> no

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:31.830 
for the graphics module I have had no

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:33.650 
for the graphics module I have had no
experience<00:00:32.309> of<00:00:32.610> graphics<00:00:33.059> up<00:00:33.239> until<00:00:33.540> this

00:00:33.650 --> 00:00:33.660 
experience of graphics up until this

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:35.330 
experience of graphics up until this
point<00:00:33.780> there's<00:00:34.320> quite<00:00:34.469> a<00:00:34.500> challenge<00:00:35.010> putting

00:00:35.330 --> 00:00:35.340 
point there's quite a challenge putting

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:36.650 
point there's quite a challenge putting
everything<00:00:35.579> together<00:00:35.880> and<00:00:36.180> seeing<00:00:36.510> how

00:00:36.650 --> 00:00:36.660 
everything together and seeing how

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:38.690 
everything together and seeing how
things<00:00:36.870> worked<00:00:37.230> in<00:00:37.440> learning<00:00:38.250> about<00:00:38.399> the

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:38.700 
things worked in learning about the

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:41.150 
things worked in learning about the
mathematics<00:00:39.420> behind<00:00:39.540> the<00:00:40.379> graphics<00:00:40.829> as<00:00:41.010> well

00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:41.160 
mathematics behind the graphics as well

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:43.430 
mathematics behind the graphics as well
the<00:00:41.790> hardest<00:00:42.120> part<00:00:42.270> of<00:00:42.480> this<00:00:42.600> course<00:00:42.930> work<00:00:43.170> for

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:43.440 
the hardest part of this course work for

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:46.130 
the hardest part of this course work for
me<00:00:43.590> was<00:00:44.239> making<00:00:45.239> sure<00:00:45.450> that<00:00:45.750> everything

00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:46.140 
me was making sure that everything

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:48.020 
me was making sure that everything
matched<00:00:46.530> up<00:00:46.800> to<00:00:46.829> win<00:00:47.100> one<00:00:47.309> domino<00:00:47.850> falls

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:48.030 
matched up to win one domino falls

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:49.760 
matched up to win one domino falls
making<00:00:48.510> sure<00:00:48.629> the<00:00:48.809> other<00:00:48.989> one<00:00:49.230> falls<00:00:49.469> at<00:00:49.739> the

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:49.770 
making sure the other one falls at the

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:52.340 
making sure the other one falls at the
specific<00:00:50.219> time<00:00:51.210> in<00:00:51.390> which<00:00:51.539> its<00:00:51.719> forrester<00:00:52.079> not

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:52.350 
specific time in which its forrester not

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:54.979 
specific time in which its forrester not
any<00:00:52.710> time<00:00:52.949> before<00:00:53.010> or<00:00:53.550> after<00:00:53.969> I<00:00:54.149> think<00:00:54.750> I<00:00:54.840> could

00:00:54.979 --> 00:00:54.989 
any time before or after I think I could

00:00:54.989 --> 00:00:56.569 
any time before or after I think I could
definitely<00:00:55.320> improve<00:00:55.710> this<00:00:55.920> graphics<00:00:56.399> course

00:00:56.569 --> 00:00:56.579 
definitely improve this graphics course

00:00:56.579 --> 00:00:58.520 
definitely improve this graphics course
up<00:00:56.730> I<00:00:56.850> am<00:00:57.030> pleased<00:00:57.360> with<00:00:57.629> I<00:00:57.870> had<00:00:58.170> no<00:00:58.320> experience

00:00:58.520 --> 00:00:58.530 
up I am pleased with I had no experience

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:00.549 
up I am pleased with I had no experience
before<00:00:58.829> and<00:00:59.100> I've<00:00:59.190> learnt<00:00:59.550> quite<00:00:59.730> a<00:00:59.789> lot<00:01:00.090> in<00:01:00.239> my

00:01:00.549 --> 00:01:00.559 
before and I've learnt quite a lot in my

00:01:00.559 --> 00:01:03.139 
before and I've learnt quite a lot in my
second<00:01:01.559> judging<00:01:01.980> the<00:01:02.129> first<00:01:02.340> term<00:01:02.609> I<00:01:02.760> studied

00:01:03.139 --> 00:01:03.149 
second judging the first term I studied

00:01:03.149 --> 00:01:04.850 
second judging the first term I studied
professional<00:01:03.719> in<00:01:03.870> social<00:01:04.229> aspects<00:01:04.680> of

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:04.860 
professional in social aspects of

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:07.160 
professional in social aspects of
computing<00:01:05.400> and<00:01:05.580> I<00:01:05.670> i<00:01:05.970> was<00:01:06.510> a<00:01:06.540> bit<00:01:06.720> weary<00:01:07.020> of

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:07.170 
computing and I i was a bit weary of

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:09.170 
computing and I i was a bit weary of
this<00:01:07.439> module<00:01:07.680> but<00:01:08.040> then<00:01:08.280> i<00:01:08.430> started<00:01:08.490> to<00:01:09.090> get

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:09.180 
this module but then i started to get

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:10.700 
this module but then i started to get
into<00:01:09.390> the<00:01:09.479> swing<00:01:09.600> of<00:01:09.840> things<00:01:09.900> and<00:01:10.200> it's<00:01:10.380> just

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:10.710 
into the swing of things and it's just

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:13.160 
into the swing of things and it's just
so<00:01:10.920> valuable<00:01:11.340> to<00:01:11.520> know<00:01:11.790> about<00:01:11.880> the<00:01:12.240> external

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:13.170 
so valuable to know about the external

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:14.990 
so valuable to know about the external
environment<00:01:13.260> and<00:01:13.799> how<00:01:14.040> that<00:01:14.189> impacts<00:01:14.670> on<00:01:14.970> the

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:15.000 
environment and how that impacts on the

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:17.390 
environment and how that impacts on the
computing<00:01:15.780> field<00:01:16.020> and<00:01:16.290> how<00:01:16.590> we<00:01:16.650> impact<00:01:17.130> on

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:17.400

on<00:01:46.649> that<00:01:46.860> horse<00:01:47.130> just<00:01:47.700> so<00:01:47.850> the<00:01:48.000> information<00:01:48.420> is

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:48.810 
on that horse just so the information is

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:51.139 
on that horse just so the information is
centralized<00:01:49.439> and<00:01:49.710> can<00:01:49.860> be<00:01:49.979> easily<00:01:50.009> managed<00:01:50.850> I

hope to run the computing science
society<00:01:53.369> so<00:01:54.299> that<00:01:54.329> involves<00:01:55.079> just<00:01:55.320> getting
