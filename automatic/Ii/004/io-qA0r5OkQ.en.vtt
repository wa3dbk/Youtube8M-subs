00:00:01.450 --> 00:00:06.220
 well so today I find you 

00:00:02.709 --> 00:00:08.080
 video for my single city and sword momentum 

00:00:06.220 --> 00:00:09.280
 contest and a promo code like 

00:00:08.080 --> 00:00:11.070
 usually for those who are there 

00:00:09.280 --> 00:00:14.260
 long since for the news is 

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:15.820
 welcome to the chain so we go 

00:00:14.260 --> 00:00:18.970
 start right away with the big 

00:00:15.820 --> 00:00:21.610
 jar that I chose who presents himself 

00:00:18.970 --> 00:00:24.010
 like these and that is the scent of 

00:00:21.610 --> 00:00:26.230
 islands so how do you explain 

00:00:24.010 --> 00:00:28.630
 how I had not seen him before on 

00:00:26.230 --> 00:00:30.190
 the site I do not understand so this is 

00:00:28.630 --> 00:00:33.999
 a candle that I did a lot 

00:00:30.190 --> 00:00:35.170
 burn as you see it is good I 

00:00:33.999 --> 00:00:37.780
 will tell you divinely good 

00:00:35.170 --> 00:00:40.239
 beautifully good et cetera and so on 

00:00:37.780 --> 00:00:43.089
 in this video one more time but that 

00:00:40.239 --> 00:00:44.559
 feel terribly good and in fact I 

00:00:43.089 --> 00:00:46.030
 wanted to describe the smell you know 

00:00:44.559 --> 00:00:48.100
 I always have a little paper with the 

00:00:46.030 --> 00:00:50.139
 smells on it and like that it allows me 

00:00:48.100 --> 00:00:51.760
 to explain a little bit the smell 

00:00:50.139 --> 00:00:53.440
 because I'm bad when I explain 

00:00:51.760 --> 00:00:55.269
 an odor or a perfume I think you 

00:00:53.440 --> 00:00:57.429
 know it now but I have not 

00:00:55.269 --> 00:01:02.289
 found the feel tehsil on this paper 

00:00:57.429 --> 00:01:04.890
 so if I tell you that it sounded it is 

00:01:02.289 --> 00:01:09.969
 good either seriously it smells them 

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:13.210
 so way if you loved the piña 

00:01:09.969 --> 00:01:15.939
 colada finally I mean the piña candle 

00:01:13.210 --> 00:01:17.829
 colada you will love scents of 

00:01:15.939 --> 00:01:20.710
 islands and more I think it smells 

00:01:17.829 --> 00:01:23.079
 just incredibly good it smells of summer 

00:01:20.710 --> 00:01:24.820
 it smells like the islands it smells the holidays to 

00:01:23.079 --> 00:01:28.240
 100 the coconut pineapple 

00:01:24.820 --> 00:01:30.009
 it smells like the sun it smells too good and 

00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:31.810
 it's my favorite of the moment I make 

00:01:30.009 --> 00:01:33.250
 burn every day I love 

00:01:31.810 --> 00:01:35.170
 I'm really happy to have 

00:01:33.250 --> 00:01:36.789
 this one in great joy because 

00:01:35.170 --> 00:01:38.649
 good I have it for a moment but really 

00:01:36.789 --> 00:01:40.299
 if you like all his scents there a 

00:01:38.649 --> 00:01:42.759
 little like me coco etc 

00:01:40.299 --> 00:01:46.630
 you go crazy feeling 

00:01:42.759 --> 00:01:49.149
 this one on average jar therefore 450 g 

00:01:46.630 --> 00:01:52.359
 I took California grape is surrounded 

00:01:49.149 --> 00:01:53.469
 of 3,500 really really too far I 

00:01:52.359 --> 00:01:56.140
 I'm absolutely not disappointed 

00:01:53.469 --> 00:01:59.289
 completely different from this kind of 

00:01:56.140 --> 00:02:01.509
 centaur there it feels its end a little the pot 

00:01:59.289 --> 00:02:03.280
 rotten but not the rotten pot that are 

00:02:01.509 --> 00:02:06.280
 toilet 

00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:07.689
 the rotten pot that smells good to my god 

00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:09.430
 the references that I bring you to each 

00:02:07.689 --> 00:02:11.150
 it's horrible it feels the reason 

00:02:09.430 --> 00:02:16.040
 but it looks good 

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:17.840
 good aaaah it reminds me a little but 

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:19.400
 you know blackcurrant hard candies the 

00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:20.810
 first we eat in the packages and 

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:21.230
 in the end it remains that the oranges and 

00:02:20.810 --> 00:02:24.049
 lemons 

00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:25.760
 it reminds me of that smell we do that 

00:02:24.049 --> 00:02:27.500
 without losing it we are this time I 

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:31.849
 can I describe the smell so 

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:33.709
 California raisin raisin vanilla fir 

00:02:31.849 --> 00:02:35.629
 and it smells really good again 

00:02:33.709 --> 00:02:37.519
 it's different from coco et cetera 

00:02:35.629 --> 00:02:40.489
 but if you like the smell of fruits a 

00:02:37.519 --> 00:02:41.930
 little bit sweet it smells it really smells 

00:02:40.489 --> 00:02:44.120

00:02:41.930 --> 00:02:46.129
 times it changes smells that chooses 

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:47.720

00:02:46.129 --> 00:02:50.959

00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:52.940

00:02:50.959 --> 00:02:55.099
