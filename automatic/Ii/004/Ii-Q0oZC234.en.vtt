tips<00:00:47.699> ok<00:00:48.699> guys<00:00:48.879> this<00:00:49.239> is<00:00:49.359> a<00:00:49.390> class<00:00:49.690> selection

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:50.260 
tips ok guys this is a class selection

00:00:50.260 --> 00:00:53.310 
tips ok guys this is a class selection
so<00:00:50.949> what<00:00:51.340> I<00:00:51.370> would<00:00:51.579> usually<00:00:51.730> go<00:00:52.000> with<00:00:52.149> is<00:00:52.420> fy7<00:00:53.230> I

00:00:53.310 --> 00:00:53.320 
so what I would usually go with is fy7 I

00:00:53.320 --> 00:00:55.170 
so what I would usually go with is fy7 I
think<00:00:53.530> it's<00:00:53.649> the<00:00:53.769> best<00:00:53.980> starting<00:00:54.609> out<00:00:54.760> assault

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:55.180 
think it's the best starting out assault

00:00:55.180 --> 00:00:57.270 
think it's the best starting out assault
rifle<00:00:55.510> at<00:00:55.690> level<00:00:56.019> 9<00:00:56.230> it<00:00:56.590> doesn't<00:00:56.980> have<00:00:57.129> much

00:00:57.270 --> 00:00:57.280 
rifle at level 9 it doesn't have much

00:00:57.280 --> 00:00:59.430 
rifle at level 9 it doesn't have much
recoil<00:00:57.760> and<00:00:58.090> it<00:00:58.359> is<00:00:58.480> good<00:00:58.660> with<00:00:58.809> red<00:00:59.050> dot<00:00:59.230> and<00:00:59.350> a

00:00:59.430 --> 00:00:59.440 
recoil and it is good with red dot and a

00:00:59.440 --> 00:01:02.160 
recoil and it is good with red dot and a
grip<00:00:59.649> on<00:00:59.800> it<00:00:59.859> so<00:01:00.519> if<00:01:00.789> you<00:01:00.910> get<00:01:01.090> the<00:01:01.269> FY<00:01:01.629> 7<00:01:01.989> and

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:02.170 
grip on it so if you get the FY 7 and

00:01:02.170 --> 00:01:04.290 
grip on it so if you get the FY 7 and
then<00:01:02.710> I<00:01:02.739> also<00:01:03.070> like<00:01:03.309> auto<00:01:03.489> armor<00:01:03.820> people<00:01:04.150> call
