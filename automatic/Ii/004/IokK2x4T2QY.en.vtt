00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:59.839
 history of medical surgeons more 

00:00:57.079 --> 00:01:01.129
 South Korean celebrities who work in 

00:00:59.839 --> 00:01:03.500
 one of the largest hospitals 

00:01:01.129 --> 00:01:05.750
 responsible for fighting cancer 

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:08.450
 practically to soldiers' patients 

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:10.700
 that are in terminal phases and they 

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:12.650
 extends its life period and with the only 

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:16.880
 variant that the main character 

00:01:12.650 --> 00:01:19.550
 what is parchÃ­s to jason because nothing nothing 

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:20.600
 nothing very big has powers 

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:23.210
 supernatural 

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:25.130
 and he is the first vampire born of two 

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:28.820
 people infected with a virus that 

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:30.890
 It not does not make them vampires but is 

00:01:28.820 --> 00:01:33.050
 that in the drama I do not explain them as 

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:36.170
 we have seen in animes as seen in the 

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:39.280
 Hollywood movies or how they tell 

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:42.500
 other stories that vampires are a 

00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:45.259
 species of surviving creatures of 

00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:47.060
 such a century and already brings in his DNA this 

00:01:45.259 --> 00:01:50.300
 he does more but if they want blood and he 

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:52.490
 turns this plot here 

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:55.850
 people are infected with a virus that 

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:58.130
 it makes your body immune to 

00:01:55.850 --> 00:02:00.770
 aging or be immune to some 

00:01:58.130 --> 00:02:04.680
 some viruses 

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:07.110
 because they are stronger but also they 

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:08.670
 it causes blood desire that's why 

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:12.120
 let's say it turns them into vampires and 

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:14.069
 Jason is the first human born from 

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:16.470
 two infected people says angel already 

00:02:14.069 --> 00:02:18.480
 brings the birth virus good as 

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:20.880
 will remember a few days ago the 

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:22.830
 Korean netizens called it bad 

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:25.680
 acting the work he was doing 

00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:27.420
 voices in this new drama you already know how 

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:29.400
 are the Korean netizens always 

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:31.860
 reviewing and well now I said I'm going to 

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:33.870
 do I will see the drama and I already tell you or 

00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:36.330
 I tell you that I thought your performance 

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:39.810
 of both characters in the performance of the 

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:42.450
 cold kid calculating and arrogant but to 

00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:44.160
 Knowing that you are right I do not like it 

00:02:42.450 --> 00:02:46.980
 his performance I like his performance 

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:49.680
 is very good the character welcomes I think 

00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:53.010
 that this time I do agree with him 

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:55.590
 Henson was typecast in his character 

00:02:53.010 --> 00:02:58.170
 randy when he played this character 

00:02:55.590 --> 00:03:01.140
 in 2009 it brings it back 

00:02:58.170 --> 00:03:02.940
 being arrogant being haughty 

00:03:01.140 --> 00:03:06.150
 screaming but in a way 

00:03:02.940 --> 00:03:07.770
 vulgar with that ego that does not make him see 

00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:09.720
 nothing good do 

00:03:07.770 --> 00:03:12.569
 remember that at the end of over flower 

00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:14.790
 voice jandy wanted to become a doctor 

00:03:12.569 --> 00:03:17.370
 in this drama he manages to say that it is the 

00:03:14.790 --> 00:03:20.370
 continuation of that world history 

00:03:17.370 --> 00:03:21.959
 and it becomes medical graduates entered 

00:03:20.370 --> 00:03:24.269
 to work at one of the most hospitals 

00:03:21.959 --> 00:03:26.400
 prestigious from South Korea and they 

00:03:24.269 --> 00:03:28.920
 find this vampire forget about 

00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:31.170
 very clean he forgets the 74 makes his 

00:03:28.920 --> 00:03:33.690
 new life and it's like moving the 

00:03:31.170 --> 00:03:36.230
 Julianne's character gave this new 

00:03:33.690 --> 00:03:39.090
 drama with a new name with a new 

00:03:36.230 --> 00:03:42.030
 gallant with a new c with a new 

00:03:39.090 --> 00:03:44.220
 story is as if coming handy lame 

00:03:42.030 --> 00:03:46.620
 we throw to this drama because it's the same 

00:03:44.220 --> 00:03:48.540
 character the same performance I'm not 

00:03:46.620 --> 00:03:50.280
 saying that acting wrong does not act badly 

00:03:48.540 --> 00:03:52.260
 acts very well is one of the best 

00:03:50.280 --> 00:03:54.299
 South Korean actresses but I hope 

00:03:52.260 --> 00:03:56.850
 to see Gandia again in this drama and 

00:03:54.299 --> 00:03:58.860
 that's not nice that's my point 

00:03:56.850 --> 00:04:00.420
 view my opinion about the performance 

00:03:58.860 --> 00:04:01.860
 of you take on this new 

00:04:00.420 --> 00:04:05.340
 that I 'm really liking 

00:04:01.860 --> 00:04:07.230
 much already today in chapter 4 and starting 

00:04:05.340 --> 00:04:09.090
 from chapter 2 you're left wanting 

00:04:07.230 --> 00:04:10.770
 what's going to happen I want to see more I want 

00:04:09.090 --> 00:04:12.090
 see more because the first chapter if the 

00:04:10.770 --> 00:04:15.180
 half is not like a little 

00:04:12.090 --> 00:04:17.220
 credited but in the first chapter 

00:04:15.180 --> 00:04:19.049
 story tells the story of Jason 

00:04:17.220 --> 00:04:20.669
 because it's like that and then you have to 

00:04:19.049 --> 00:04:22.830
 see it to understand next time 

00:04:20.669 --> 00:04:25.200
 personally wintering the story a 

00:04:22.830 --> 00:04:27.030
 vampire story we will not say 

00:04:25.200 --> 00:04:30.540
 which is super different but yes with 

00:04:27.030 --> 00:04:32.100
 many many variants differently than 

00:04:30.540 --> 00:04:34.110
 we have seen what raises 

00:04:32.100 --> 00:04:37.620
 hollywood or what we think several 

00:04:34.110 --> 00:04:39.360
 books then it's good they have a 

00:04:37.620 --> 00:04:41.760
 good story if you are not seeing it 

00:04:39.360 --> 00:04:44.250
 veil you're really going to like if you 

00:04:41.760 --> 00:04:46.260
 liked a handy in 2009 you will like it 

00:04:44.250 --> 00:04:47.850
 this drama if you did not like veil too 

00:04:46.260 --> 00:04:49.980
 because he has a very good history in 

00:04:47.850 --> 00:04:52.770
 truth is 

00:04:49.980 --> 00:04:55.740
