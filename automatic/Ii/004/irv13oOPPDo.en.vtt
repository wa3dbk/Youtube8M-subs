00:00:02.030 --> 00:00:20.609
 came to speak and weighed everything in good 

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:22.980
 welcome to another video and 

00:00:20.609 --> 00:00:25.890
 You do not know me. I'm a nerd. Cloud. 

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:28.529
 worst crossfire player in this world 

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:30.420
 do not take me out they have to release a player who 

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:32.669
 they have solved if gamer's hand has no way 

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:34.230
 That world here is very bad to see 

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:37.350
 team now bringing here a gameplay 

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:39.360
 of the new bridge map on the map in quotation marks 

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:41.610
 Because, again, there is nothing 

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:44.399
 practically a ship spade only with 

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:46.110
 more indifferent then yes the 8 did the 

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:48.270
 same thing they did with the pope 

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:49.950
 revellion is not understanding the thought 

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:51.960
 who are taking maps of the game 

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:54.270
 just turning left and speaking that it is 

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:56.850
 new when I saw the update trailer 

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:58.680
 with the name phoenix the first to the first 

00:00:56.850 --> 00:01:00.739
 The thing that I thought was, will it be? 

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:03.329
 a new map of the galley make human funk 

00:01:00.739 --> 00:01:05.640
 pychyl phoenix must have thought something 

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:08.130
 so can not speak and not in the 

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:10.500
 a new way in which it happens only 

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:12.869
 late in the game where players 

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:16.110
 kill however when you die dog 

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:18.810
 barking old when you die do not fall 

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:20.490
 on the floor it's complicated explaining this but 

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:22.650
 Summing up, it seems like you 're not 

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:25.350
 dying and only killing his 

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:27.299
 deaths are counted starting at the Cade 

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:29.340
 update name is phoenix to and not 

00:01:27.299 --> 00:01:31.409
 You understand why that name but has 

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:32.490
 two theories one of them certainly is 

00:01:31.409 --> 00:01:34.200
 right right 

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:36.119
 first that the name was given because 

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:38.159
 players die in the end already in the 

00:01:36.119 --> 00:01:40.110
 hour without falling or anything at all 

00:01:38.159 --> 00:01:41.640
 already it seems like the guy is healing 

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:43.110
 when he dies as if they have 

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:47.310
 raising equal mythological creature 

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:49.290
 phoenix and another because of the 4 km phoenix 

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:50.970
 We have already seen several updates with the name 

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:52.680
 from the corner of the gun, but it would not 

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:54.390
 sense to make an update where 

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:56.820
 guns are the main reason for the name 

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:58.560
 of the update and left the second part 

00:01:56.820 --> 00:02:00.600
 right guy is good that the game is 

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:01.710
 crossfire makes sense because the game 

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:03.659
 does not make sense 

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:05.189
 But beauty, you had to content yourself with 

00:02:03.659 --> 00:02:07.049
 This is the way I just hope this 

00:02:05.189 --> 00:02:09.270
 fashion from catching map changing this 

00:02:07.049 --> 00:02:11.670
 do not take my god send it 

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:13.710
 But it's easy to enjoy the map. 

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:15.330
 has facebook to record a little room 

00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:16.680
 I did not have to worry about a hacker. 

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:19.050
 Why are you so connected? How are you? 

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:21.960
 crossfire situation at the moment as 

00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:25.110
 some of the channel's subscribers still feel 

00:02:21.960 --> 00:02:26.250
 one is that here in April I suspect not 

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:28.200
 I'll say nothing 

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:30.120
 but it was not only I was suspecting it's the 

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:31.710
 team all when I'm not going to tell him who 

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:33.420
 it is you who draw your conclusions 

00:02:31.710 --> 00:02:34.920
 still gameplay 

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:38.010
 I would like to thank all those 

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:40.650
 glued into the room that they must be 

00:02:38.010 --> 00:02:42.240
 called there do not know it gives a offers the 

00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:44.700
 Gouche test, I 'm telling you who. 

00:02:42.240 --> 00:02:47.760
 asked to save our line as I said 

00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:49.110
 in a past video I can not remember which one 

00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:51.480
 I 'm send greetings to whoever you are 

00:02:49.110 --> 00:02:53.250
 in the room when I'm recording, right? 

00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:54.630
 so I hope you understand, it's a lot of people 

00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:56.730
 asking up for me, did not we? 

00:02:54.630 --> 00:02:57.930
 comments on youtube and I always finish 

00:02:56.730 --> 00:02:59.430
 forgetting then when one finishes 

00:02:57.930 --> 00:03:02.310
 forgetting someone is a guy stays 

00:02:59.430 --> 00:03:04.890
 upset and then right and so I prefer to walk 

00:03:02.310 --> 00:03:06.720
 only to whoever is in the room and weigh 

00:03:04.890 --> 00:03:09.330
 channel from next week and 

00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:11.070
 You will be going through some changes right 

00:03:09.330 --> 00:03:13.170
 everything to make it better for you and 

00:03:11.070 --> 00:03:14.790
 for me first it will be tell us 

00:03:13.170 --> 00:03:17.040
 that he post videos and wont post 

00:03:14.790 --> 00:03:18.390
 video on Mondays and Thursdays but 

00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:20.760
 Because of the work, it's kind of 

00:03:18.390 --> 00:03:23.400
 complicated to post video then 

00:03:20.760 --> 00:03:24.930
 I decided that I will post all the 

00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:26.520
 Wednesdays and Saturdays 

00:03:24.930 --> 00:03:28.110
 that as of next week this 

00:03:26.520 --> 00:03:30.270
 still a video site in the 

00:03:28.110 --> 00:03:32.010
 Monday and Thursday and the other change 

00:03:30.270 --> 00:03:33.540
 on the channel look and I'm going to try a week 

00:03:32.010 --> 00:03:35.730
 It gives an improvement in everything because if there 

00:03:33.540 --> 00:03:37.560
 but I'm already finding the channel look 

00:03:35.730 --> 00:03:39.090
 then I will try to give a 

00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:41.430
 customized on the channel this week to 

00:03:39.090 --> 00:03:43.560
 sister for relative is look at you 

00:03:41.430 --> 00:03:45.420
 size without recording the quiet dog 

00:03:43.560 --> 00:03:49.700
 and I start to record it with chocolate 

00:03:45.420 --> 00:03:54.030
 in the world of son of a bitch its mutts 

00:03:49.700 --> 00:03:55.350
 pun and that's it despite having 

00:03:54.030 --> 00:03:56.670
 liked the video right? 

00:03:55.350 --> 00:03:59.280
 If you like or do not forget to leave 

00:03:56.670 --> 00:04:01.080
