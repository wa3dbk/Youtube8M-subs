00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:21.430 
of them get that first down you will be

00:02:21.430 --> 00:02:23.040 
of them get that first down you will be
a<00:02:21.550> little<00:02:21.700> bit<00:02:21.940> susceptible<00:02:22.540> to<00:02:22.570> any<00:02:22.810> ropes

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:23.050

that<00:02:23.230> extend<00:02:23.590> past<00:02:23.800> the<00:02:24.040> first<00:02:24.250> down<00:02:24.459> marker

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:24.490 
that extend past the first down marker

00:02:24.490 --> 00:02:26.820 
that extend past the first down marker
but<00:02:25.090> it's<00:02:25.510> a<00:02:25.630> great<00:02:25.840> mechanic<00:02:26.260> so<00:02:26.410> Rex<00:02:26.650> why

00:02:26.820 --> 00:02:26.830 
but it's a great mechanic so Rex why

00:02:26.830 --> 00:02:30.030 
but it's a great mechanic so Rex why

00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:15.850 
gonna spawn all these new catches this

00:03:15.850 --> 00:03:17.640 
gonna spawn all these new catches this
is<00:03:16.000> one<00:03:16.150> of<00:03:16.180> those<00:03:16.299> efforts<00:03:16.780> I<00:03:16.900> talked<00:03:17.560> about

00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:17.650 
is one of those efforts I talked about

00:03:17.650 --> 00:03:19.800 
is one of those efforts I talked about
earlier<00:03:17.799> so<00:03:18.519> you<00:03:18.640> can<00:03:18.790> see<00:03:18.910> the<00:03:19.000> pass<00:03:19.209> accuracy

00:03:19.800 --> 00:03:19.810 
earlier so you can see the pass accuracy

00:03:19.810 --> 00:03:21.660 
earlier so you can see the pass accuracy
out<00:03:20.260> route<00:03:20.500> to<00:03:20.680> the<00:03:20.799> sidelines<00:03:21.190> difficult

00:03:21.660 --> 00:03:21.670 
out route to the sidelines difficult

00:03:21.670 --> 00:03:24.000 
out route to the sidelines difficult
route<00:03:21.820> to<00:03:22.000> throw<00:03:22.239> obviously<00:03:22.870> this<00:03:23.560> one's<00:03:23.830> a

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:24.010 
route to throw obviously this one's a

00:03:24.010 --> 00:03:26.009 
route to throw obviously this one's a
little<00:03:24.130> high<00:03:24.400> out<00:03:24.610> in<00:03:24.760> front<00:03:24.970> you<00:03:25.660> can<00:03:25.840> see

00:03:26.009 --> 00:03:26.019 
little high out in front you can see

00:03:26.019 --> 00:03:28.289 
little high out in front you can see
that<00:03:26.230> that's<00:03:26.380> not<00:03:27.220> catchable<00:03:27.700> but<00:03:28.000> look<00:03:28.180> at

00:03:28.289 --> 00:03:28.299 
that that's not catchable but look at

00:03:28.299 --> 00:03:29.520 
that that's not catchable but look at
that<00:03:28.360> animation<00:03:28.900> he's<00:03:29.019> gonna<00:03:29.140> play<00:03:29.380> an

00:03:29.520 --> 00:03:29.530 
that animation he's gonna play an

00:03:29.530 --> 00:03:30.870 
that animation he's gonna play an
animation<00:03:29.920> to<00:03:30.190> make<00:03:30.340> it<00:03:30.430> look<00:03:30.580> like<00:03:30.730> he's

00:03:30.870 --> 00:03:30.880 
animation to make it look like he's

00:03:30.880 --> 00:03:32.490 
animation to make it look like he's
trying<00:03:30.910> to<00:03:31.120> make<00:03:31.239> the<00:03:31.330> catch<00:03:31.540> anyway<00:03:31.930> last

00:03:32.490 --> 00:03:32.500 
trying to make the catch anyway last

00:03:32.500 --> 00:03:33.750 
trying to make the catch anyway last
year<00:03:32.799> he<00:03:32.890> would<00:03:33.010> have<00:03:33.100> just<00:03:33.250> stood<00:03:33.459> there<00:03:33.489> and

00:03:33.750 --> 00:03:33.760 
year he would have just stood there and

00:03:33.760 --> 00:03:35.250 
year he would have just stood there and
just<00:03:34.180> let<00:03:34.330> the<00:03:34.420> ball<00:03:34.570> go<00:03:34.690> by<00:03:34.840> him<00:03:34.959> because<00:03:35.170> it

00:03:35.250 --> 00:03:35.260 
just let the ball go by him because it

00:03:35.260 --> 00:03:36.690 
just let the ball go by him because it
wasn't<00:03:35.500> catchable<00:03:35.769> so<00:03:36.220> that's<00:03:36.400> the<00:03:36.519> pass

00:03:36.690 --> 00:03:36.700 
wasn't catchable so that's the pass

00:03:36.700 --> 00:03:38.520 
wasn't catchable so that's the pass
