00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:16.139
 new disk in russia but foreign 

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:17.960
 the publisher doesn't bother us much 

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:20.130

00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:23.039

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:34.920
 big medium size but pretty 

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:37.290

 even though very thin but here it is not there 

00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:54.940
