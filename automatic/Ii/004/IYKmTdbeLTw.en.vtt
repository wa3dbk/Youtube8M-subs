play on the GTA 5 heists DLC update and
essentially<00:00:07.080> what<00:00:07.200> this<00:00:07.290> is<00:00:07.350> is<00:00:07.500> it's<00:00:08.040> one<00:00:08.189> of

00:00:08.270 --> 00:00:08.280 
essentially what this is is it's one of

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:10.280 
essentially what this is is it's one of
the<00:00:08.340> ones<00:00:08.519> that<00:00:08.790> you<00:00:09.450> have<00:00:09.480> the<00:00:09.809> attackers<00:00:10.260> and

00:00:10.280 --> 00:00:10.290 
the ones that you have the attackers and

00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:11.900 
the ones that you have the attackers and
me<00:00:10.530> a<00:00:10.559> hundred<00:00:11.219> and<00:00:11.370> you<00:00:11.429> have<00:00:11.550> the<00:00:11.639> runners

00:00:11.900 --> 00:00:11.910 
me a hundred and you have the runners

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:14.990 
me a hundred and you have the runners
the<00:00:12.389> hunters<00:00:12.840> have<00:00:13.380> I<00:00:13.769> think<00:00:14.219> limited

00:00:14.990 --> 00:00:15.000 
the hunters have I think limited

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:16.700 
the hunters have I think limited
movement<00:00:15.540> and<00:00:15.809> the<00:00:16.020> runners<00:00:16.320> have<00:00:16.500> more

00:00:16.700 --> 00:00:16.710 
movement and the runners have more

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:18.859 
movement and the runners have more
movement<00:00:16.949> so<00:00:17.250> what<00:00:17.400> is<00:00:17.550> is<00:00:17.820> see<00:00:18.539> the<00:00:18.660> three

00:00:18.859 --> 00:00:18.869 
movement so what is is see the three

00:00:18.869 --> 00:00:20.540 
movement so what is is see the three
runners<00:00:19.109> come<00:00:19.230> out<00:00:19.289> to<00:00:19.410> play<00:00:19.560> at<00:00:20.189> the<00:00:20.369> Redwood

00:01:05.929 --> 00:01:05.939 
we're on quad bikes and what we want to

00:01:05.939 --> 00:01:07.880 
we're on quad bikes and what we want to
do<00:01:06.090> is<00:01:06.240> hunt<00:01:06.450> the<00:01:06.600> runner<00:01:06.780> we<00:01:07.470> only<00:01:07.590> have<00:01:07.710> sort

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:07.890 
do is hunt the runner we only have sort

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:09.710 
do is hunt the runner we only have sort
of<00:01:07.920> shotguns<00:01:08.310> they<00:01:08.430> have<00:01:08.640> variety<00:01:09.479> of<00:01:09.510> weapons

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:09.720 
of shotguns they have variety of weapons

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:11.330 
of shotguns they have variety of weapons
I<00:01:10.110> think<00:01:10.320> they<00:01:10.409> can<00:01:10.560> go<00:01:10.680> off<00:01:10.740> their<00:01:10.920> thing<00:01:11.100> we

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:11.340 
I think they can go off their thing we

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:14.030 
I think they can go off their thing we
can't<00:01:11.580> so<00:01:12.540> it's<00:01:13.170> like<00:01:13.290> zombies<00:01:13.680> hunting

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:14.040 
can't so it's like zombies hunting

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:16.820 
can't so it's like zombies hunting
werewolves<00:01:14.549> essentially<00:01:15.090> so<00:01:15.960> sort<00:01:16.770> of

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:16.830 
werewolves essentially so sort of

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:20.380 
werewolves essentially so sort of

00:01:53.159 --> 00:01:57.319 
he is completely he's like 10 times more
powerful<00:01:53.399> than<00:01:53.549> us<00:01:53.810> so<00:01:54.810> I<00:01:55.500> guess<00:01:56.220> we<00:01:56.759> should<00:01:56.789> be

00:01:57.319 --> 00:01:57.329 
powerful than us so I guess we should be

00:01:57.329 --> 00:02:00.710 
powerful than us so I guess we should be
able<00:01:57.420> to<00:01:57.509> do<00:01:57.659> this<00:01:57.829> maybe<00:01:59.299> we<00:02:00.299> can't<00:02:00.539> get<00:02:00.659> off

00:02:00.710 --> 00:02:00.720 
able to do this maybe we can't get off

00:02:00.720 --> 00:02:06.850 
able to do this maybe we can't get off
the<00:02:00.840> quad<00:02:01.049> so<00:02:01.319> it's<00:02:01.500> fair

00:02:06.850 --> 00:02:06.860 

00:02:06.860 --> 00:02:11.500 

oh<00:02:06.890> my<00:02:07.640> god<00:02:07.820> okay<00:02:08.060> I<00:02:08.240> got<00:02:08.660> more<00:02:08.840> ready<00:02:10.450> let's<00:02:11.450> go

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:11.510 
oh my god okay I got more ready let's go

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:13.360 
oh my god okay I got more ready let's go
one<00:02:11.690> of<00:02:11.780> the<00:02:11.840> quickest<00:02:12.140> rounds<00:02:12.410> ever<00:02:12.590> say

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:13.370 
one of the quickest rounds ever say

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:15.760 
one of the quickest rounds ever say
obviously<00:02:13.550> I<00:02:13.820> think<00:02:14.060> the<00:02:14.390> runners<00:02:14.570> can<00:02:15.560> have

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:15.770 
obviously I think the runners can have

00:02:15.770 --> 00:02:17.380 
obviously I think the runners can have
quite<00:02:16.040> a<00:02:16.100> lot<00:02:16.220> of<00:02:16.280> people<00:02:16.550> things<00:02:16.790> like<00:02:16.850> admah

00:02:17.380 --> 00:02:17.390 
quite a lot of people things like admah

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:19.840 
quite a lot of people things like admah
it<00:02:17.870> sort<00:02:18.260> of<00:02:18.290> it<00:02:18.410> equates<00:02:18.830> itself<00:02:19.310> out<00:02:19.580> so

00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:19.850 
it sort of it equates itself out so

00:02:19.850 --> 00:02:21.460 
it sort of it equates itself out so
consider<00:02:20.450> there's<00:02:20.630> only<00:02:20.720> three<00:02:20.930> of<00:02:20.990> us<00:02:21.140> you

00:02:21.460 --> 00:02:21.470 
consider there's only three of us you

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:24.790 
consider there's only three of us you
can't<00:02:21.680> have<00:02:21.860> two<00:02:22.070> runners<00:02:22.430> and<00:02:22.640> one<00:02:23.800> hunter

00:02:24.790 --> 00:02:24.800 
can't have two runners and one hunter

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:27.160 
can't have two runners and one hunter
because<00:02:25.070> that<00:02:25.220> would<00:02:25.310> be<00:02:25.370> really<00:02:25.640> unfair<00:02:26.170> so

00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:27.170 
because that would be really unfair so

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:29.950 
because that would be really unfair so
we're<00:02:27.890> just<00:02:27.920> gonna<00:02:28.070> have<00:02:28.190> oh<00:02:28.630> yes<00:02:29.630> oh<00:02:29.780> yeah

00:02:29.950 --> 00:02:29.960 
we're just gonna have oh yes oh yeah

00:02:29.960 --> 00:02:31.360 
we're just gonna have oh yes oh yeah
like<00:02:30.170> all<00:02:30.320> DT<00:02:30.560> does<00:02:30.740> that<00:02:30.890> sort<00:02:31.100> of<00:02:31.160> works

00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:31.370 
like all DT does that sort of works

00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:33.160 
like all DT does that sort of works
itself<00:02:31.670> out<00:02:31.790> otherwise<00:02:32.270> it<00:02:32.420> would<00:02:32.510> be<00:02:32.540> fairly

00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:33.170 
itself out otherwise it would be fairly

00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:36.070 
itself out otherwise it would be fairly
unfair<00:02:34.190> Helly<00:02:34.670> unfair<00:02:35.090> I'm<00:02:35.450> not<00:02:35.630> sure<00:02:35.870> if<00:02:35.990> you

00:02:36.070 --> 00:02:36.080 
unfair Helly unfair I'm not sure if you

00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:37.660 
unfair Helly unfair I'm not sure if you
can<00:02:36.230> don't<00:02:36.980> worry<00:02:37.010> don't<00:02:37.340> worry

00:02:40.210 --> 00:02:40.220
