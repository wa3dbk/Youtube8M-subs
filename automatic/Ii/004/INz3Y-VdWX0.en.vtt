00:00:02.060 --> 00:00:05.060
 ace 

00:00:18.730 --> 00:00:30.590
 and what I do is investigate in the 

00:00:27.740 --> 00:00:34.970
 music of these great composers who 

00:00:30.590 --> 00:00:37.280
 There are flamenco and folklore parts 

00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:38.870
 or all popular music and then 

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:42.470
 Extrapolating is seen with our guitar 

00:00:38.870 --> 00:00:44.310
 funk to a transcript to adapt the 

00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:46.720
 guitar 

00:00:44.310 --> 00:00:48.490
 Y 

00:00:46.720 --> 00:00:51.700
 but suddenly I started to see that the 

00:00:48.490 --> 00:00:53.620
 scarlatti's music had certain 

00:00:51.700 --> 00:00:56.320
 characteristics of flamenco music 

00:00:53.620 --> 00:00:59.380
 then in some passages 

00:00:56.320 --> 00:01:01.180
 it sounds like a rhythm similar to 

00:00:59.380 --> 00:01:03.940
 tanguillos what is done in flamenco 

00:01:01.180 --> 00:01:06.190
 but of course at that time it would be another 

00:01:03.940 --> 00:01:09.700
 kind of pace but that kind of three by 

00:01:06.190 --> 00:01:11.470
 four that we do good that 

00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:13.479
 we are immersed is practically the 

00:01:11.470 --> 00:01:15.880
 our music is immersed in that three 

00:01:13.479 --> 00:01:18.850
 by four and it's very popular rhythm 

00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:21.160
 both popular music and the 

00:01:18.850 --> 00:01:24.540
 flamenco for example the bulería la soleá 

00:01:21.160 --> 00:01:24.540
 the seguiriya for example 

00:01:28.220 --> 00:01:35.660
 in these courtyards are surrounded by streets 

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:40.670
 relatively narrow and I perceive 

00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:42.230
 when I'm in a city which by 

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:44.600
 streets are 

00:01:42.230 --> 00:01:47.150
 if in a certain way you narrow when 

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:50.290
 you enter here and you see that big yard 

00:01:47.150 --> 00:01:53.960
 what you are not is a feeling of 

00:01:50.290 --> 00:01:57.260
 much easily relax the one who answers 

00:01:53.960 --> 00:02:00.140
 very well with that aesthetic attention that 

00:01:57.260 --> 00:02:04.310
 comes from outside this way I every time 

00:02:00.140 --> 00:02:06.290
 I am more committed to how 

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:08.740
 sensitive genera and exist to produce 

00:02:06.290 --> 00:02:08.740
 with beauty
