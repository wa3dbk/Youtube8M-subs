00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.589
 in 2010 42 million people had 

00:00:02.939 --> 00:00:06.240
 that migrate from their places of origin 

00:00:04.589 --> 00:00:07.980
 due to natural phenomena that 

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:10.410
 happened as a result of the change 

00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:12.929
 climatic the million dollar question today is 

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:14.910
 we can face this problem of 

00:00:12.929 --> 00:00:18.300
 agreement with political scientists and 

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:20.939
 businessmen it is possible floods 

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:23.730
 earthquakes ripping hills 

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:26.010
 tornadoes erosion of lands and droughts 

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:27.930
 are just some examples of what the 

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:29.970
 global warming is causing in 

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:32.040
 our planet and joined these 

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:33.360
 natural disasters adds a 

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:35.489
 major problem 

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:37.110
 the species, both animals and 

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:39.000
 human are facing the 

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:40.720
 need to flee their places of 

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:43.030
 origin 

00:00:40.720 --> 00:00:44.830
 natural catastrophes tend to 

00:00:43.030 --> 00:00:47.140
 enhance the vulnerability of 

00:00:44.830 --> 00:00:49.090
 people is why all the 

00:00:47.140 --> 00:00:50.580
 natural phenomena that happen due 

00:00:49.090 --> 00:00:52.630
 to the increase in the Earth's temperature 

00:00:50.580 --> 00:00:54.970
 hit the strongest 

00:00:52.630 --> 00:00:57.520
 poorest communities in the world on 

00:00:54.970 --> 00:01:00.310
 everything to those who live in countries in ways 

00:00:57.520 --> 00:01:03.160
 of development climate change 

00:01:00.310 --> 00:01:05.410
 It really is not a class issue 

00:01:03.160 --> 00:01:07.300
 What happens is that if the 

00:01:05.410 --> 00:01:10.840
 consequences can affect a 

00:01:07.300 --> 00:01:12.940
 disproportionately to the population 

00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:14.560
 that has very few resources and does not 

00:01:12.940 --> 00:01:16.450
 It affects the whole world because 

00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:18.520
 affects economic development if it is 

00:01:16.450 --> 00:01:20.800
 really climate change does not 

00:01:18.520 --> 00:01:22.690
 discriminates the change in temperature 

00:01:20.800 --> 00:01:24.640
 of the earth responds to two activities 

00:01:22.690 --> 00:01:28.630
 central fuels burning 

00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:30.009
 fossils and deforestation is the fault of 

00:01:28.630 --> 00:01:32.410
 the institutions is the fault of the government 

00:01:30.009 --> 00:01:34.930
 it's the society's fault are flaws of 

00:01:32.410 --> 00:01:36.610
 government are failures of the 

00:01:34.930 --> 00:01:38.890
 institutionality that must be corrected 

00:01:36.610 --> 00:01:40.750
 according to statistics thrown 

00:01:38.890 --> 00:01:42.520
 for the program of the united nations 

00:01:40.750 --> 00:01:44.880
 for the environment only in africa 

00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:47.409
 there could be 50 million refugees 

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:49.780
 environmental issues for the year 2060 

00:01:47.409 --> 00:01:51.520
 but what do we need to stop the 

00:01:49.780 --> 00:01:53.200
 climate change and with it the imminent 

00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:54.520
 human migration what is very 

00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:57.090
 important are also a campaign 

00:01:54.520 --> 00:01:59.079
 educational we are going to explain to people 

00:01:57.090 --> 00:02:01.060
 first we have a very problem 

00:01:59.079 --> 00:02:03.640
 serious and that we're going to lose out 

00:02:01.060 --> 00:02:05.460
 if we do not do something with respect it is but 

00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:07.530
 people can 

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:09.569
 and take the necessary measures to 

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:11.550
 irrigate go you have to explain that you do not 

00:02:09.569 --> 00:02:13.980
 we are talking about sacrifices and it is 

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:16.709
 precisely mexico a country that counts 

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:19.440
 with 11,200 kilometers of coastline with 

00:02:16.709 --> 00:02:21.450
 a relatively narrow geography and 

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:23.700
 located between two of the extensions of 

00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:26.250
 most important water in the world what 

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:27.780
 make weather events such 

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:30.300
 so the intergovernmental panel 

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:32.459
 of climate change predicts that the 

00:02:30.300 --> 00:02:34.890
 Southeast Mexico suffer from floods 

00:02:32.459 --> 00:02:37.170
 by the increase of 1 to 6 meters of the level 

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:39.750
 from the sea there will be loss of housing and 

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:41.910
 infrastructure and with it migration of 

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:45.420
 inhabitants of the coastal area towards 

00:02:41.910 --> 00:02:49.580
 inland is very fundamental that 

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:53.160
 there is one let's say an internal migration 

00:02:49.580 --> 00:02:54.989
 intra-urban areas to rearrange in areas of 

00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:57.690
 Low risk in high density areas 

00:02:54.989 --> 00:03:00.420
 with services to this population that lives 

00:02:57.690 --> 00:03:02.190
 dispersed in ravines or the violation in 

00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:05.220
 the edge of the hills that is totally 

00:03:02.190 --> 00:03:07.319
 unfeasible it is imperative to do it before this 

00:03:05.220 --> 00:03:10.230
 the federal government launched during the 

00:03:07.319 --> 00:03:12.420
 2013 environmental policies to address 

00:03:10.230 --> 00:03:15.420
 this issue and that has 8 

00:03:12.420 --> 00:03:17.880
 action reduce vulnerability to 

00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:20.700
 climate change accelerate transition 

00:03:17.880 --> 00:03:22.190
 energy and clean energy reduce 

00:03:20.700 --> 00:03:25.140
 the intensity of energy consumption 

00:03:22.190 --> 00:03:27.690
 reduce emissions from deforestation and 

00:03:25.140 --> 00:03:29.670
 degradation as well as pollutants from 

00:03:27.690 --> 00:03:31.890
 life short like black carbon and the 

00:03:29.670 --> 00:03:35.010
 methane and move towards models of 

00:03:31.890 --> 00:03:37.319
 sustainable cities however the 

00:03:35.010 --> 00:03:39.300
 the same year was presented and the 

00:03:37.319 --> 00:03:40.920
 energy reform which is committed to 

00:03:39.300 --> 00:03:42.930
 the exploitation of hydrocarbons and not 

00:03:40.920 --> 00:03:45.269
 presents how production will be increased 

00:03:42.930 --> 00:03:46.680
 and use of renewable energy for 

00:03:45.269 --> 00:03:48.959
 reduce the impact on change 

00:03:46.680 --> 00:03:51.150
 This was expressed by the union of 

00:03:48.959 --> 00:03:52.790
 scientists committed to 

00:03:51.150 --> 00:03:55.579
 society 

00:03:52.790 --> 00:03:56.930
 it also requires a fund that 

00:03:55.579 --> 00:03:59.299
 let build a reserve 

00:03:56.930 --> 00:04:01.250
 intraurban territorial 

00:03:59.299 --> 00:04:02.689
 redensify the cities and relocate 

00:04:01.250 --> 00:04:05.329
 the population that is in situation of 

00:04:02.689 --> 00:04:07.310
 high risk this implies let's say have 

00:04:05.329 --> 00:04:09.109
 a whole scheme in subsidies of credits 

00:04:07.310 --> 00:04:11.359
 mortgage financing 

00:04:09.109 --> 00:04:14.480
 urban housing projects 

00:04:11.359 --> 00:04:16.039
 of population relocation is a 

00:04:14.480 --> 00:04:17.690
 tricolor of the revolution in the 

00:04:16.039 --> 00:04:19.459
 housing policies and policies 

00:04:17.690 --> 00:04:21.799
 urban and logical and for you to 

00:04:19.459 --> 00:04:24.410
 policies work, the 

00:04:21.799 --> 00:04:27.440
 work of society the government and by 

00:04:24.410 --> 00:04:28.849
 course the business sector the subject 

00:04:27.440 --> 00:04:31.130
 of migration for the foundation 

00:04:28.849 --> 00:04:32.870
 bancomer is not a new issue if we have 

00:04:31.130 --> 00:04:35.120
 been working since 2006 with 

00:04:32.870 --> 00:04:37.550
 different programs but also in the 

00:04:35.120 --> 00:04:40.160
 economic studies area because it has been 

00:04:37.550 --> 00:04:43.910
 an important actor both nationally and 

00:04:40.160 --> 00:04:45.530
 international in these issues the part 

00:04:43.910 --> 00:04:47.150
 of climate change well what what 

00:04:45.530 --> 00:04:49.520
 we are seeing as one of the factors 

00:04:47.150 --> 00:04:52.460
 important ones that are generating a 

00:04:49.520 --> 00:04:54.819
 very important amount of 

00:04:52.460 --> 00:04:57.380
 of people who have to leave 

00:04:54.819 --> 00:04:59.720
 involuntarily due to issues of drought or 

00:04:57.380 --> 00:05:03.319
 for issues of excess water in their 

00:04:59.720 --> 00:05:06.380
 communities or for lack of opportunities 

00:05:03.319 --> 00:05:09.500
 even in the sowing because because 

00:05:06.380 --> 00:05:12.860
 erosion ends with its with its 

00:05:09.500 --> 00:05:14.750
 parcels this is not necessarily to 

00:05:12.860 --> 00:05:16.699
 through unique public policies and 

00:05:14.750 --> 00:05:19.550
 we exclusively have to do everything 

00:05:16.699 --> 00:05:22.759
 from the personal part I am 

00:05:19.550 --> 00:05:23.960
 because you think that if it does not generate it is not 

00:05:22.759 --> 00:05:25.520
 generate initiatives from the 

00:05:23.960 --> 00:05:27.139
 government will not work and states 

00:05:25.520 --> 00:05:29.840
 very wrong but in the end there are many 

00:05:27.139 --> 00:05:32.599
 things that can be done with transportation 

00:05:29.840 --> 00:05:36.259
 the housing sector in the industry 

00:05:32.599 --> 00:05:39.470
 to become more efficient and start 

00:05:36.259 --> 00:05:41.660
 to use more free energies with images 

00:05:39.470 --> 00:05:44.500
