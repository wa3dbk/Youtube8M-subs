00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.480
 hi all guys are blin 46 

00:00:01.709 --> 00:00:06.150
 welcome back to a new video today vi 

00:00:03.480 --> 00:00:07.620
 I bring new youtube news 

00:00:06.150 --> 00:00:11.929
 then as I brought you the other time 

00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:15.660
 the new player today I bring youtube to 

00:00:11.929 --> 00:00:19.140
 360 degrees kids is something 

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:20.789
 absolutely absolutely epic 

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:23.279
 I will now start a moment in 

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:25.260
 video giving I do n't hear the audio though 

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:28.380
 let's remove them was at home and 

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:31.019
 guys this is something absurd 

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:32.759
 look now i hope it is 

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:35.809
 recording because I'm doing a great job 

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:38.940
 a test we can practically guys 

00:00:35.809 --> 00:00:41.340
 see the video 360 degrees then this 

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:44.219
 it is not the best in quality and 

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:47.270
 within a formula 1 really 

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:50.579
 however, it is something spectacular 

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:52.829
 potential of this function 

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:54.719
 I now put it in 4k first put it by 

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:56.850
 only in 4k the resolution because it is 

00:00:54.719 --> 00:00:59.940
 the highest one 

00:00:56.850 --> 00:01:02.579
 I still don't know exactly how it works and 

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:03.960
 how it is used on video 

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:06.900
 however we say that quality is not 

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:08.729
 exactly it's not exactly the best 

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:12.390
 let's say one of the most beautiful I have 

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:14.100
 seen was that of tomorrowland ne 

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:16.080
 we were just talking last night 

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:18.270
 really something spectacular that 

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:20.670
 can revolutionize the way skiing 

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:22.710
 video on youtube but that goes well in that 

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:24.630
 case can not really revolution shoot 

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:25.259
 of death that is the way of making videos on 

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:27.840
 youtube 

00:01:25.259 --> 00:01:29.520
 I really could bring creation 

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:30.780
 of some content that is something 

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:33.720
 crazy 

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:35.430
 I had then we mention the three a was 

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:37.560
 done even at three in fact 

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:39.090
 I also wanted to ask something like that 

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:40.799
 in the three there have been several innovations 

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:44.369
 backward compatibility was announced 

00:01:40.799 --> 00:01:46.229
 sailing games for 60 on xbox one are 

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:49.140
 some already been launched 

00:01:46.229 --> 00:01:50.970
 presented some games and more 

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:52.470
 I'd like to make you a video do me 

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:54.509
 to know if it may interest you 

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:56.700
 Now let's see if I find a moment 

00:01:54.509 --> 00:01:59.700
 video of the three since it was 

00:01:56.700 --> 00:02:01.439
 as soon as it was just done maybe it is 

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:04.860
 more cute we go forward 

00:02:01.439 --> 00:02:06.060
 ok look look look is something 

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:08.039
 of absurdity 

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:10.349
 really there is in quality is 

00:02:08.039 --> 00:02:12.090
 better than that of formula 1 

00:02:10.349 --> 00:02:14.430
 because obviously the image states 

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:16.620
 so the quality looks better 

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:19.110
 some points rather than the whole 

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:21.900
 scene that the movement really guys 

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:24.180
 that is something absurd it is as if it is 

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:26.160
 like having a camera there for goodness sake 

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:28.230
 is a video recorded for something 

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:30.360
 really incredible 

00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:36.330
 let me know if you tried it I tell you 

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:40.069
 the quality in 4k is already good in 1080 i 

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:44.069
 now I've tried but it's not the best 

00:02:40.069 --> 00:02:47.730
 let's say that in 1080 it looks like a 360 more 

00:02:44.069 --> 00:02:53.660
 true in four 80 1080 looks like a pre 80 

00:02:47.730 --> 00:02:55.950
 while in 4k it seems 720 not very much 

00:02:53.660 --> 00:02:57.930
 let's say that really the potential 

00:02:55.950 --> 00:03:00.090
 are incredible was launched at 8 

00:02:57.930 --> 00:03:04.230
 k on youtube you would like to bring you a 

00:03:00.090 --> 00:03:05.970
 right video for the fact of saying ho 

00:03:04.230 --> 00:03:07.769
 took my our stage and take advantage of it 

00:03:05.970 --> 00:03:08.310
 and try the new features of 

00:03:07.769 --> 00:03:10.470
 youtube 

00:03:08.310 --> 00:03:13.170
 another thing as I was telling you 

00:03:10.470 --> 00:03:15.030
 I really had to cancel youtube 

00:03:13.170 --> 00:03:18.840
 the gta finger and reloaded it 0 later 

00:03:15.030 --> 00:03:20.280
 because practically youtube has decided to 

00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:22.890
 don't send the films not only to me but 

00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:25.380
 nobody and therefore in two hours had not 

00:03:22.890 --> 00:03:28.650
 no one will have sent about 20 

00:03:25.380 --> 00:03:30.480
 views while the next day in 

00:03:28.650 --> 00:03:32.340
 an hour has made more than 600 then 

00:03:30.480 --> 00:03:34.500
 really thanks to youtube thanks you 

00:03:32.340 --> 00:03:37.350

00:03:34.500 --> 00:03:39.329
