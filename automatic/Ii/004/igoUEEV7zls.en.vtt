00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:05.299
 listening to ct promised to popularize 64-bit computers 

00:00:05.830 --> 00:00:10.610
 currently the overwhelming majority of the machines operated 32 bits 

00:00:11.539 --> 00:00:13.469
 And you may ask yourself. 

00:00:13.469 --> 00:00:15.589
 Does that make any difference? 

00:00:15.589 --> 00:00:18.900
 at the time of installing windows 7 running choose which version 

00:00:19.849 --> 00:00:22.849
 check out the answers to family 

00:00:24.880 --> 00:00:28.690
 you know the differences between 32 and 64 bits 

00:00:29.249 --> 00:00:33.420
 know the advantages and disadvantages of having a processor a system 

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:35.800
 operational in either standard 

00:00:35.800 --> 00:00:39.760
 well to start now to understand that politics is a unit the same way 

00:00:39.760 --> 00:00:43.949
 that the subways serve to measure distances observe as a measure of 

00:00:43.949 --> 00:00:49.000
 digital information theoretically the 64-bit processor can process the 

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:54.140
 twice as many a 32-bit processor at the same time this is even worse 

00:00:54.800 --> 00:00:58.810
 another advantage of 64-bit processors is that they can manage 

00:00:58.810 --> 00:01:00.699
 much more ram 

00:01:00.699 --> 00:01:05.350
 the 32-bit work with the maximum of 4 gigs low number if we take in 

00:01:05.350 --> 00:01:09.119
 the requirements of certain programs which are already part of our 

00:01:09.119 --> 00:01:13.560
 day-by-day basis, so that all this potential can be 

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:17.880
 necessary that your operating system also offer 64-bit 

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:18.870
 that's why 

00:01:18.870 --> 00:01:23.510
 windows xp the view and more recently windows 7 offer the two 

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:26.970
 possibilities 

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:30.400
 until very recently even though you had a system processor 

00:01:30.400 --> 00:01:35.010
 operating system running on 64-bit would still face problems is that most 

00:01:35.010 --> 00:01:38.540
 of the programs available on the market had not yet adapted to the new 

00:01:38.540 --> 00:01:39.460
 reality 

00:01:39.460 --> 00:01:44.240
 today almost all the software of the wheel a new platform so it is point 

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:48.490
 you prefer a processor that is an operating system both of 

00:01:48.490 --> 00:01:54.070
 64-bit from now on, the 32-bit processors so strong in 

00:01:54.070 --> 00:01:57.200
 until very little time are already heading for oblivion. 

00:01:57.940 --> 00:02:01.280
 and you know if your processor is already 64-bit 

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:04.620
 to discover these and other information about your boss 

00:02:04.619 --> 00:02:09.369
 as family speed and technology advisor dictates the point with 

00:02:09.369 --> 00:02:14.590
 below, I have always used a free program that 

00:02:14.590 --> 00:02:16.439
 details with the proposal 

00:02:16.439 --> 00:02:17.329
 this spirit
