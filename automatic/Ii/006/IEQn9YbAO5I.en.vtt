00:00:05.890 --> 00:00:12.110
 48 civilians 

00:00:09.910 --> 00:00:13.940
 hi all guys are long and 

00:00:12.110 --> 00:00:16.010
 welcome to this new video this 

00:00:13.940 --> 00:00:18.500
 new console section 

00:00:16.010 --> 00:00:21.470
 today we will talk mainly about xbox 

00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:23.480
 360 and we'll talk about the earthenware game 

00:00:21.470 --> 00:00:28.689
 terraria which is the product and published 

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:28.689
 from the re logic on 16 May 2011 

00:00:37.420 --> 00:00:43.510
 having said that I say one thing that the 

00:00:41.530 --> 00:00:46.600
 difference between chigi terraria and terraria 

00:00:43.510 --> 00:00:49.059
 console playstation 3 and xbox 360 

00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:50.769
 maybe a little regarding the 

00:00:49.059 --> 00:00:53.140
 joystick and joystick in the sense that it is 

00:00:50.769 --> 00:00:57.899
 difficult to select cubes from shadows 

00:00:53.140 --> 00:00:57.899
 as you see, in fact you will do it 

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:15.549
 but once familiar with the 

00:01:13.780 --> 00:01:18.970
 joystick everything is easier 

00:01:15.549 --> 00:01:22.929
 the game is you can buy through psn 

00:01:18.970 --> 00:01:25.119
 for playstation 3 from May 20, 2013 in 

00:01:22.929 --> 00:01:28.209
 then more or less that date while up 

00:01:25.119 --> 00:01:32.830
 xbox 360 is already available with microsoft 

00:01:28.209 --> 00:01:34.869
 microsoft points boys well the game is 

00:01:32.830 --> 00:01:36.909
 behind the pc there are maybe some 

00:01:34.869 --> 00:01:39.009
 extra boxwood something extra 

00:01:36.909 --> 00:01:41.409
 I recommend for those interested who it is 

00:01:39.009 --> 00:01:43.119
 passionate about terraria to try it there is 

00:01:41.409 --> 00:01:46.060
 even a demo version if not 

00:01:43.119 --> 00:01:50.820

00:01:46.060 --> 00:01:50.820
