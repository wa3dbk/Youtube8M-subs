section<00:02:59.389> it<00:02:59.930> kind<00:03:00.200> of<00:03:00.319> almost<00:03:00.530> repeats<00:03:01.099> it's<00:03:01.400> a

00:03:01.479 --> 00:03:01.489 
section it kind of almost repeats it's a

00:03:01.489 --> 00:03:03.729 
section it kind of almost repeats it's a
little<00:03:01.700> different<00:03:01.910> but<00:03:02.269> this<00:03:03.230> is<00:03:03.410> where<00:03:03.620> the

00:03:03.729 --> 00:03:03.739 
little different but this is where the

00:03:03.739 --> 00:03:05.979 
little different but this is where the
goodness<00:03:04.130> is<00:03:04.340> for<00:03:04.790> this<00:03:04.910> particular<00:03:05.450> track<00:03:05.780> so

00:03:05.979 --> 00:03:05.989 
goodness is for this particular track so

00:03:05.989 --> 00:03:07.440 
goodness is for this particular track so
this<00:03:06.139> is<00:03:06.260> the<00:03:06.349> part<00:03:06.590> that's<00:03:06.620> important<00:03:07.250> to<00:03:07.370> me

00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:07.450 
this is the part that's important to me

00:03:07.450 --> 00:03:10.330 
this is the part that's important to me
so<00:03:08.450> what<00:03:08.780> I<00:03:08.810> could<00:03:09.109> do<00:03:09.290> now<00:03:09.530> is<00:03:09.799> just<00:03:09.829> come<00:03:10.220> to

00:03:10.330 --> 00:03:10.340 
so what I could do now is just come to

00:03:10.340 --> 00:03:12.819 
so what I could do now is just come to
where<00:03:10.489> it<00:03:10.579> breaks<00:03:10.790> down<00:03:11.000> and<00:03:11.780> see<00:03:12.139> if<00:03:12.290> taking

00:03:12.819 --> 00:03:12.829 
where it breaks down and see if taking

00:03:12.829 --> 00:03:14.740 
where it breaks down and see if taking
this<00:03:12.950> breakdown<00:03:13.280> and<00:03:13.880> just<00:03:14.060> sliding<00:03:14.510> it<00:03:14.630> on

00:03:14.740 --> 00:03:14.750 
this breakdown and just sliding it on

00:03:14.750 --> 00:03:16.270 
this breakdown and just sliding it on
top<00:03:14.989> of<00:03:15.169> their<00:03:15.319> see<00:03:15.590> if<00:03:15.709> that's<00:03:15.890> that

00:03:16.270 --> 00:03:16.280 
top of their see if that's that

00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:25.700 
top of their see if that's that
transition<00:03:16.909> sounds<00:03:17.390> good

00:03:25.700 --> 00:03:25.710 

00:03:25.710 --> 00:03:28.680 

as<00:03:26.710> a<00:03:26.770> creative<00:03:27.340> tool<00:03:27.640> and<00:03:28.060> for<00:03:28.270> someone<00:03:28.540> and

00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:28.690 
as a creative tool and for someone and

00:03:28.690 --> 00:03:30.450 
as a creative tool and for someone and
it<00:03:28.840> sounds<00:03:29.170> fine<00:03:29.350> it's<00:03:29.620> that<00:03:29.770> and<00:03:29.950> most<00:03:30.070> tracks

00:03:30.450 --> 00:03:30.460 
it sounds fine it's that and most tracks

00:03:30.460 --> 00:03:32.630 
it sounds fine it's that and most tracks
do<00:03:30.760> I<00:03:31.060> mean<00:03:31.270> most<00:03:31.450> tracks<00:03:31.870> the<00:03:32.110> breakdowns

00:03:32.630 --> 00:03:32.640 
do I mean most tracks the breakdowns

00:03:32.640 --> 00:03:35.040 
do I mean most tracks the breakdowns
there's<00:03:33.640> a<00:03:33.700> lot<00:03:33.790> of<00:03:33.940> similarities<00:03:34.720> in<00:03:34.900> them

00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:35.050 
there's a lot of similarities in them

00:03:35.050 --> 00:03:36.990 
there's a lot of similarities in them
and<00:03:35.230> they<00:03:35.320> all<00:03:35.470> sound<00:03:35.860> fine<00:03:36.160> if<00:03:36.460> you<00:03:36.610> kind<00:03:36.850> of

00:03:36.990 --> 00:03:37.000 
and they all sound fine if you kind of

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:39.210 
and they all sound fine if you kind of
do<00:03:37.150> these<00:03:37.360> little<00:03:37.630> edits<00:03:37.930> but<00:03:38.680> I<00:03:38.710> wouldn't

00:03:39.210 --> 00:03:39.220

it<00:05:02.149> but<00:05:02.299> you<00:05:02.359> want<00:05:02.479> to<00:05:02.509> be<00:05:02.569> careful<00:05:02.779> with<00:05:02.989> that

it but you want to be careful with that

00:05:03.049 --> 00:05:05.229 
it but you want to be careful with that
because<00:05:03.229> it's<00:05:03.649> already<00:05:03.979> a<00:05:04.129> master<00:05:04.549> track<00:05:04.909> and

it's<00:05:05.659> already<00:05:06.049> fairly<00:05:06.289> compressed<00:05:06.979> so<00:05:07.399> you

00:05:08.109 --> 00:05:08.119 
it's already fairly compressed so you

00:05:08.119 --> 00:05:10.179 
it's already fairly compressed so you
