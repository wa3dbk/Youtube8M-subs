Glenn what are we gonna do with $10,000
and<00:00:47.729> we're<00:00:47.999> in<00:00:48.179> T<00:00:48.510> and<00:00:49.050> glad<00:00:49.260> said<00:00:49.499> well<00:00:49.649> why

00:00:49.759 --> 00:00:49.769 
and we're in T and glad said well why

00:00:49.769 --> 00:00:51.860 
and we're in T and glad said well why
don't<00:00:49.829> we<00:00:49.949> get<00:00:50.129> a<00:00:50.190> T<00:00:50.460> which<00:00:51.269> we<00:00:51.449> went<00:00:51.569> out<00:00:51.719> and

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:51.870 
don't we get a T which we went out and

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:56.809 
don't we get a T which we went out and
did<00:00:53.239> so<00:00:54.239> we<00:00:54.389> restored<00:00:54.899> the<00:00:55.199> T<00:00:55.679> worked<00:00:56.670> on

00:00:56.809 --> 00:00:56.819 
did so we restored the T worked on

00:00:56.819 --> 00:00:58.399 
did so we restored the T worked on
students<00:00:57.389> for<00:00:57.539> a<00:00:57.569> number<00:00:57.600> of<00:00:57.839> years<00:00:58.049> I<00:00:58.139> was

00:00:58.399 --> 00:00:58.409 
students for a number of years I was

00:00:58.409 --> 00:01:00.110 
students for a number of years I was
great<00:00:58.620> fun<00:00:58.859> and<00:00:59.100> the<00:00:59.370> students<00:00:59.670> learned<00:00:59.879> a<00:00:59.969> lot

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:00.120 
great fun and the students learned a lot

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:04.640 
great fun and the students learned a lot
and<00:01:00.569> then<00:01:02.209> Glenn<00:01:03.209> came<00:01:03.449> up<00:01:03.569> to<00:01:03.780> the<00:01:03.899> idea<00:01:04.440> said

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:04.650 
and then Glenn came up to the idea said

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:07.399 
and then Glenn came up to the idea said
why<00:01:04.739> don't<00:01:04.799> we<00:01:04.920> do<00:01:05.040> a<00:01:05.070> motorcycle<00:01:05.870> so<00:01:06.870> as<00:01:07.229> we

00:01:07.399 --> 00:01:07.409 
why don't we do a motorcycle so as we

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:09.490 
why don't we do a motorcycle so as we
were<00:01:07.500> looking<00:01:07.620> at<00:01:07.920> him<00:01:08.070> going<00:01:08.100> pulled<00:01:08.640> up

00:01:09.490 --> 00:01:09.500 
were looking at him going pulled up

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:13.510 
were looking at him going pulled up
trying<00:01:10.500> tiger<00:01:11.219> cub<00:01:11.579> and<00:01:12.270> I<00:01:12.390> looked<00:01:12.659> at<00:01:12.869> it<00:01:12.899> and

00:01:13.510 --> 00:01:13.520 
trying tiger cub and I looked at it and

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:16.100 
trying tiger cub and I looked at it and
saw<00:01:14.520> the<00:01:14.549> name<00:01:14.880> I<00:01:15.210> don't<00:01:15.659> know<00:01:15.750> that<00:01:15.930> much

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:16.110 
saw the name I don't know that much

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:18.139 
saw the name I don't know that much
about<00:01:16.170> motorcycles<00:01:17.070> but<00:01:17.250> I<00:01:17.310> saw<00:01:17.549> a<00:01:17.579> tiger<00:01:17.939> cub

00:01:18.139 --> 00:01:18.149 
about motorcycles but I saw a tiger cub

00:01:18.149 --> 00:01:20.149 
about motorcycles but I saw a tiger cub
and<00:01:18.329> I<00:01:18.420> said<00:01:18.630> the<00:01:18.780> Princeton<00:01:19.289> and<00:01:19.560> it's<00:01:20.009> at

00:01:20.149 --> 00:01:20.159 
and I said the Princeton and it's at

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:20.690 
and I said the Princeton and it's at
first

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:20.700

first
Princeton<00:01:21.210> freshman<00:01:21.780> what<00:01:22.350> could<00:01:22.590> be<00:01:22.740> better

00:01:22.969 --> 00:01:22.979 
Princeton freshman what could be better

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:26.209 
Princeton freshman what could be better
than<00:01:23.159> a<00:01:23.340> tiger<00:01:23.789> cub<00:01:24.200> this<00:01:25.200> is<00:01:25.350> not<00:01:25.500> motorcycle

00:01:26.209 --> 00:01:26.219 
than a tiger cub this is not motorcycle

00:01:26.219 --> 00:01:28.849 
than a tiger cub this is not motorcycle
maintenance<00:01:26.539> its<00:01:27.619> motorcycles<00:01:28.619> because

00:01:28.849 --> 00:01:28.859 
maintenance its motorcycles because

00:01:28.859 --> 00:01:30.709 
maintenance its motorcycles because
we're<00:01:29.039> principal<00:01:29.579> it's<00:01:29.820> tough<00:01:30.149> it's

00:01:30.709 --> 00:01:30.719 
we're principal it's tough it's

00:01:30.719 --> 00:01:32.749 
we're principal it's tough it's
motorcycle<00:01:31.590> design<00:01:31.799> there's<00:01:32.430> a<00:01:32.490> huge

00:01:32.749 --> 00:01:32.759 
motorcycle design there's a huge

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:35.959 
motorcycle design there's a huge
difference<00:01:33.240> there<00:01:33.560> we<00:01:34.560> look<00:01:34.770> at<00:01:34.950> many<00:01:35.250> years

00:01:35.959 --> 00:01:35.969 
difference there we look at many years

00:01:35.969 --> 00:01:39.620 
difference there we look at many years
of<00:01:36.270> the<00:01:36.530> motorcycle<00:01:37.640> sequential<00:01:38.640> years<00:01:38.969> which

00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:39.630 
of the motorcycle sequential years which

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:40.910 
of the motorcycle sequential years which
allows<00:01:39.929> us<00:01:40.140> to<00:01:40.170> do<00:01:40.439> some<00:01:40.649> critical

00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:40.920 
allows us to do some critical

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:43.609 
allows us to do some critical
comparative<00:01:41.670> analysis<00:01:42.240> if<00:01:43.020> we<00:01:43.229> think<00:01:43.439> about

00:01:43.609 --> 00:01:43.619 
comparative analysis if we think about

00:01:43.619 --> 00:01:45.709 
comparative analysis if we think about
the<00:01:43.920> motorcycle<00:01:44.579> as<00:01:44.700> a<00:01:44.729> system<00:01:45.240> you<00:01:45.329> can<00:01:45.539> break

have<00:02:01.859> here<00:02:01.890> is<00:02:02.219> a<00:02:02.249> little<00:02:02.429> gadget<00:02:02.880> of<00:02:03.060> fun<00:02:03.299> it's

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:04.140 
have here is a little gadget of fun it's

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:07.669 
have here is a little gadget of fun it's
the<00:02:04.289> ping-pong<00:02:04.560> rocket<00:02:05.310> we<00:02:05.520> hook<00:02:05.759> up<00:02:06.679> there's

00:02:07.669 --> 00:02:07.679 
the ping-pong rocket we hook up there's

00:02:07.679 --> 00:02:08.219 
the ping-pong rocket we hook up there's
a<00:02:07.740> little<00:02:07.859> bit

00:02:08.219 --> 00:02:08.229 
a little bit

00:02:08.229 --> 00:02:10.619 
a little bit
acid<00:02:08.709> this<00:02:09.009> is<00:02:09.129> water<00:02:09.489> on<00:02:09.610> that<00:02:09.879> flask<00:02:10.239> there's

00:02:10.619 --> 00:02:10.629 
acid this is water on that flask there's

00:02:10.629 --> 00:02:12.570 
acid this is water on that flask there's
a<00:02:10.659> little<00:02:10.869> bit<00:02:10.989> acid<00:02:11.409> in<00:02:11.500> there<00:02:11.680> to<00:02:12.129> last<00:02:12.310> for

00:02:12.570 --> 00:02:12.580 
a little bit acid in there to last for

00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:15.059 
a little bit acid in there to last for
some<00:02:12.730> conductivity<00:02:13.500> I'll<00:02:14.500> hook<00:02:14.650> it<00:02:14.799> up<00:02:14.890> to<00:02:15.040> a

00:02:15.059 --> 00:02:15.069 
some conductivity I'll hook it up to a

00:02:15.069 --> 00:02:17.880 
some conductivity I'll hook it up to a
battery<00:02:15.540> two<00:02:16.540> electrodes<00:02:17.080> in<00:02:17.319> the<00:02:17.349> liquid<00:02:17.739> and

00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:17.890 
battery two electrodes in the liquid and

00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:20.009 
battery two electrodes in the liquid and
then<00:02:18.549> when<00:02:18.670> you<00:02:18.760> do<00:02:18.879> that<00:02:18.940> you<00:02:19.720> have<00:02:19.750> the

00:02:20.009 --> 00:02:20.019 
then when you do that you have the

00:02:20.019 --> 00:02:22.500 
then when you do that you have the
process<00:02:20.470> of<00:02:20.620> hydrolysis<00:02:21.340> so<00:02:21.760> you<00:02:21.849> break<00:02:22.120> water

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:22.510 
process of hydrolysis so you break water

00:02:22.510 --> 00:02:24.509 
process of hydrolysis so you break water
into<00:02:23.290> hydrogen<00:02:23.560> and<00:02:23.920> oxygen

00:02:24.509 --> 00:02:24.519 
into hydrogen and oxygen

00:02:24.519 --> 00:02:26.309 
into hydrogen and oxygen
okay<00:02:24.940> so<00:02:25.000> hydrogen<00:02:25.540> oxygen<00:02:25.870> come<00:02:26.170> together

00:02:26.309 --> 00:02:26.319 
okay so hydrogen oxygen come together

00:02:26.319 --> 00:02:30.869 
okay so hydrogen oxygen come together
next<00:02:26.769> slide<00:02:28.319> open<00:02:29.319> the<00:02:29.680> valve<00:02:29.890> to<00:02:30.099> mix<00:02:30.340> gases

00:02:30.869 --> 00:02:30.879 
next slide open the valve to mix gases

00:02:30.879 --> 00:02:32.610 
next slide open the valve to mix gases
puts<00:02:31.090> them<00:02:31.209> in<00:02:31.299> that<00:02:31.390> little<00:02:31.450> chamber<00:02:32.080> next

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:32.620 
puts them in that little chamber next

00:02:32.620 --> 00:02:49.979 
puts them in that little chamber next
slide<00:02:33.480> ignite<00:02:34.480> the<00:02:34.660> mixture<00:02:34.780> to<00:02:46.530> the<00:02:48.660> gas<00:02:49.660> tank

00:02:49.979 --> 00:02:49.989 
slide ignite the mixture to the gas tank

00:02:49.989 --> 00:02:52.650 
slide ignite the mixture to the gas tank
on<00:02:50.230> the<00:02:50.650> motorcycle<00:02:51.280> serves<00:02:51.519> two<00:02:51.760> purposes<00:02:51.790> it

00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:52.660 
on the motorcycle serves two purposes it

00:02:52.660 --> 00:02:56.280 
on the motorcycle serves two purposes it
is<00:02:53.410> it<00:02:53.829> holds<00:02:54.250> the<00:02:54.370> gasoline<00:02:54.879> but<00:02:55.540> also<00:02:55.750> it's

00:02:56.280 --> 00:02:56.290 
is it holds the gasoline but also it's

00:02:56.290 --> 00:02:57.930 
is it holds the gasoline but also it's
at<00:02:56.440> a<00:02:56.470> point<00:02:56.799> in<00:02:57.040> the<00:02:57.129> frame<00:02:57.400> that<00:02:57.459> needs

00:02:57.930 --> 00:02:57.940 
at a point in the frame that needs

00:02:57.940 --> 00:03:00.180 
at a point in the frame that needs
bracelet<00:02:58.540> as<00:02:58.660> you<00:02:58.720> look<00:02:58.959> inside<00:02:59.470> the<00:02:59.709> gas<00:02:59.859> tank

00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:00.190 
bracelet as you look inside the gas tank

00:03:00.190 --> 00:03:01.349 
bracelet as you look inside the gas tank
you<00:03:00.250> sight<00:03:00.549> to<00:03:00.790> see<00:03:00.819> that<00:03:01.090> there's<00:03:01.269> an

00:03:01.349 --> 00:03:01.359 
you sight to see that there's an

00:03:01.359 --> 00:03:04.080 
you sight to see that there's an
internal<00:03:01.720> struck<00:03:02.200> there<00:03:02.470> and<00:03:02.709> it<00:03:03.099> completes

00:03:04.080 --> 00:03:04.090 
internal struck there and it completes

00:03:04.090 --> 00:03:07.289 
internal struck there and it completes
the<00:03:04.269> frame<00:03:04.599> so<00:03:05.440> the<00:03:05.560> tank<00:03:05.859> is<00:03:06.099> part<00:03:06.879> of<00:03:07.120> the

00:03:07.289 --> 00:03:07.299 
the frame so the tank is part of the

00:03:07.299 --> 00:03:10.530 
the frame so the tank is part of the
frame<00:03:07.599> and<00:03:08.140> it's<00:03:08.500> also<00:03:08.890> serving<00:03:09.609> the<00:03:09.730> role<00:03:10.150> of

00:03:10.530 --> 00:03:10.540 
frame and it's also serving the role of

00:03:10.540 --> 00:03:12.449 
frame and it's also serving the role of
holding<00:03:11.049> a<00:03:11.170> few<00:03:11.319> so<00:03:11.890> it's<00:03:12.040> doing<00:03:12.310> two<00:03:12.430> things

00:03:12.449 --> 00:03:12.459 
holding a few so it's doing two things

00:03:12.459 --> 00:03:14.909 
holding a few so it's doing two things
at<00:03:12.849> once<00:03:13.060> and<00:03:13.389> there's<00:03:13.599> a<00:03:13.690> lot<00:03:13.900> of<00:03:14.079> those<00:03:14.319> kinds

00:03:14.909 --> 00:03:14.919 
at once and there's a lot of those kinds

00:03:14.919 --> 00:03:16.949 
at once and there's a lot of those kinds
of<00:03:15.040> integrated<00:03:15.819> parts<00:03:16.209> that<00:03:16.510> are<00:03:16.630> a<00:03:16.660> part<00:03:16.930> of

00:03:16.949 --> 00:03:16.959 
of integrated parts that are a part of

00:03:16.959 --> 00:03:19.500 
of integrated parts that are a part of
the<00:03:17.079> motorcycle<00:03:17.620> this<00:03:18.040> year<00:03:18.430> I<00:03:18.609> am<00:03:19.030> happy<00:03:19.389> to
