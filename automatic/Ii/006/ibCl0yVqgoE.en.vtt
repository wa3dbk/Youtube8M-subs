bazillion<00:00:39.320> blogs<00:00:39.799> this<00:00:40.190> season<00:00:40.610> so<00:00:41.089> I<00:00:41.390> thought

00:00:41.590 --> 00:00:41.600 
bazillion blogs this season so I thought

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:44.410 
bazillion blogs this season so I thought
I<00:00:41.629> would<00:00:41.720> give<00:00:42.140> you<00:00:42.229> a<00:00:42.260> quick<00:00:42.530> demo<00:00:42.979> so<00:00:43.699> it

00:00:44.410 --> 00:00:44.420 
I would give you a quick demo so it

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:47.469 
I would give you a quick demo so it
starts<00:00:44.930> out<00:00:45.080> with<00:00:45.470> some<00:00:45.970> different<00:00:46.970> strips<00:00:47.269> I

00:00:47.469 --> 00:00:47.479 
starts out with some different strips I

00:00:47.479 --> 00:00:50.109 
starts out with some different strips I
cut<00:00:47.750> these<00:00:47.900> about<00:00:48.110> an<00:00:48.350> inch<00:00:48.559> long<00:00:49.040> and<00:00:49.430> then

00:00:50.109 --> 00:00:50.119 
cut these about an inch long and then

00:00:50.119 --> 00:00:53.890 
cut these about an inch long and then
I'm<00:00:50.540> using<00:00:50.780> seven<00:00:51.409> strips<00:00:51.890> so<00:00:52.570> I've<00:00:53.570> got<00:00:53.780> them

00:00:53.890 --> 00:00:53.900 
I'm using seven strips so I've got them

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:56.410 
I'm using seven strips so I've got them
cut<00:00:54.199> in<00:00:54.470> graduated<00:00:55.430> lengths<00:00:55.850> so<00:00:56.000> the<00:00:56.210> first

00:00:56.410 --> 00:00:56.420 
cut in graduated lengths so the first

00:00:56.420 --> 00:01:04.660 
cut in graduated lengths so the first
one's<00:00:56.629> 12<00:00:56.989> inches<00:00:57.379> then<00:00:58.010> 10<00:00:58.430> then<00:00:59.049> 8<00:01:02.559> and<00:01:03.670> then

00:01:04.660 --> 00:01:04.670 
one's 12 inches then 10 then 8 and then

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:06.310 
one's 12 inches then 10 then 8 and then
I<00:01:04.699> repeat<00:01:05.059> those<00:01:05.269> on<00:01:05.420> the<00:01:05.510> other<00:01:05.659> side<00:01:05.930> so

00:01:06.310 --> 00:01:06.320 
I repeat those on the other side so

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:09.999 
I repeat those on the other side so
again<00:01:06.530> it's<00:01:07.899> graduated<00:01:08.899> strips<00:01:09.320> get<00:01:09.679> that<00:01:09.859> out

00:01:09.999 --> 00:01:10.009 
again it's graduated strips get that out

00:01:10.009 --> 00:01:14.410 
again it's graduated strips get that out
of<00:01:10.100> the<00:01:10.159> way<00:01:10.310> so<00:01:11.000> 12<00:01:11.450> inches<00:01:11.780> 10<00:01:12.409> 8<00:01:13.149> and<00:01:14.149> then

00:01:14.410 --> 00:01:14.420 
of the way so 12 inches 10 8 and then

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:15.550 
of the way so 12 inches 10 8 and then
we're<00:01:14.570> going<00:01:14.689> to<00:01:14.719> parallel<00:01:15.170> that<00:01:15.320> on<00:01:15.469> the

00:01:15.550 --> 00:01:15.560 
we're going to parallel that on the

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:17.800 
we're going to parallel that on the
other<00:01:15.619> side<00:01:15.679> 12<00:01:16.250> inches<00:01:16.520> 10<00:01:16.909> I'm<00:01:17.479> going<00:01:17.630> to<00:01:17.719> do

00:01:17.800 --> 00:01:17.810 
other side 12 inches 10 I'm going to do

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:20.440 
other side 12 inches 10 I'm going to do
these<00:01:17.960> 8<00:01:18.170> and<00:01:18.619> then<00:01:19.250> we<00:01:19.640> have<00:01:19.759> a<00:01:19.789> center<00:01:20.149> strip

00:01:20.440 --> 00:01:20.450 
these 8 and then we have a center strip

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:22.510 
these 8 and then we have a center strip
that's<00:01:20.780> actually<00:01:21.259> shorter<00:01:21.740> than<00:01:21.920> all<00:01:22.159> of<00:01:22.340> them

00:01:22.510 --> 00:01:22.520 
that's actually shorter than all of them

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:25.330 
that's actually shorter than all of them
in<00:01:22.729> the<00:01:22.820> middle<00:01:23.179> these<00:01:24.020> all<00:01:24.320> so<00:01:24.770> I'm<00:01:24.920> going<00:01:25.249> to

00:01:25.330 --> 00:01:25.340 
in the middle these all so I'm going to

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:27.190 
in the middle these all so I'm going to
have<00:01:25.429> a<00:01:25.460> using<00:01:26.030> double-sided<00:01:26.299> cardstock<00:01:26.990> so

00:01:27.190 --> 00:01:27.200 
have a using double-sided cardstock so

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:29.469 
have a using double-sided cardstock so
your<00:01:28.159> outer<00:01:28.340> strips<00:01:28.759> are<00:01:28.909> the<00:01:28.969> same<00:01:29.210> length

00:01:29.469 --> 00:01:29.479 
your outer strips are the same length

00:01:29.479 --> 00:01:31.989 
your outer strips are the same length
and<00:01:29.749> they<00:01:30.350> could<00:01:30.619> go<00:01:30.829> in<00:01:31.130> so<00:01:31.399> they<00:01:31.520> you<00:01:31.850> have

00:01:31.989 --> 00:01:31.999 
and they could go in so they you have

00:01:31.999 --> 00:01:33.639 
and they could go in so they you have
pairs<00:01:32.329> of<00:01:32.570> strips<00:01:32.840> so<00:01:32.990> these<00:01:33.140> are<00:01:33.289> the<00:01:33.380> 12

00:01:33.639 --> 00:01:33.649 
pairs of strips so these are the 12

00:01:33.649 --> 00:01:36.069 
pairs of strips so these are the 12
inches<00:01:33.950> 10<00:01:34.249> inches<00:01:34.280> 8<00:01:34.759> inches<00:01:34.789> middle<00:01:35.719> one<00:01:35.869> is

00:01:36.069 --> 00:01:36.079 
inches 10 inches 8 inches middle one is

00:01:36.079 --> 00:01:39.550 
inches 10 inches 8 inches middle one is
7<00:01:36.469> so<00:01:36.859> you<00:01:36.890> can<00:01:37.159> do<00:01:37.280> it<00:01:37.399> any<00:01:37.640> length<00:01:38.560> just

00:01:39.550 --> 00:01:39.560 
7 so you can do it any length just

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:42.010 
7 so you can do it any length just
remember<00:01:40.009> your<00:01:40.159> two<00:01:40.340> outer<00:01:40.549> two<00:01:41.509> then<00:01:41.840> the

00:01:42.010 --> 00:01:42.020 
remember your two outer two then the

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:44.050 
remember your two outer two then the
next<00:01:42.319> to<00:01:42.469> the<00:01:42.499> next<00:01:42.710> to<00:01:42.979> the<00:01:43.100> middle<00:01:43.700> one<00:01:43.850> is

00:01:44.050 --> 00:01:44.060 
next to the next to the middle one is

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:46.120 
next to the next to the middle one is
just<00:01:44.509> a<00:01:44.689> little<00:01:44.899> bit<00:01:44.990> shorter<00:01:45.409> so<00:01:45.590> I've<00:01:45.979> done

00:01:46.120 --> 00:01:46.130 
just a little bit shorter so I've done

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:48.760 
just a little bit shorter so I've done
it<00:01:46.280> with<00:01:46.399> 11<00:01:46.759> inches<00:01:47.030> 9<00:01:47.240> inches<00:01:47.630> 7<00:01:48.109> inches<00:01:48.439> 6

00:01:48.760 --> 00:01:48.770 
it with 11 inches 9 inches 7 inches 6

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:50.859 
it with 11 inches 9 inches 7 inches 6
inches<00:01:49.039> you<00:01:49.520> can<00:01:49.670> vary<00:01:49.969> them<00:01:50.270> all<00:01:50.479> over<00:01:50.780> the

00:01:50.859 --> 00:01:50.869 
inches you can vary them all over the

00:01:50.869 --> 00:01:52.840 
inches you can vary them all over the
place<00:01:51.079> so<00:01:51.259> I<00:01:51.590> just<00:01:51.889> picked<00:01:52.100> 12<00:01:52.310> since<00:01:52.579> I<00:01:52.670> had<00:01:52.819> a

00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:52.850 
place so I just picked 12 since I had a

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:55.660 
place so I just picked 12 since I had a
bunch<00:01:53.090> of<00:01:53.210> 12<00:01:53.509> inch<00:01:53.979> cardstock<00:01:54.979> strips<00:01:55.399> so<00:01:55.549> I'm

00:01:55.660 --> 00:01:55.670 
bunch of 12 inch cardstock strips so I'm

00:01:55.670 --> 00:01:57.399 
bunch of 12 inch cardstock strips so I'm
