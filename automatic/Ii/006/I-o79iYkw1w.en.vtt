00:00:07.809 --> 00:00:12.139
 hello everyone we go again for the video 

00:00:10.580 --> 00:00:14.029
 number three on the hand seam 

00:00:12.139 --> 00:00:15.260
 the installation that I realized is 

00:00:14.029 --> 00:00:17.990
 not conform to reality 

00:00:15.260 --> 00:00:19.310
 it just aims to zoom in 

00:00:17.990 --> 00:00:21.349
 very close with the camera 

00:00:19.310 --> 00:00:23.720
 of course we sew with a clip 

00:00:21.349 --> 00:00:25.580
 between the legs we'll see two 

00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:28.130
 simple sewing types 

00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:30.109
 also called right seam until 13 

00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:33.410
 and there blow hard there it is on the last 

00:00:30.109 --> 00:00:35.420
 part to sew you need 

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:38.000
 in allen with pliers and two needles 

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:40.040
 first how to hold the wool you 

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:42.080
 learned it in your hand to break through 

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:43.700
 we hold it like that when we're done 

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:47.330
 to pierce it back to the top 

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:49.040
 with the help of the thumb and how to hold 

00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:51.230
 needles your breath is always 

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:54.020
 in your hand towards the way taste of 

00:00:51.230 --> 00:00:55.700
 hold the needles like this between your 

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:57.890
 fingers for the passage inside the 

00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:59.870
 leather or outside between your fingers 

00:00:57.890 --> 00:01:02.710
 in order to plant your breath 

00:00:59.870 --> 00:01:02.710
 without being embarrassed 

00:01:08.360 --> 00:01:10.960
 you 

00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:15.520
 first take your needles on 

00:01:13.450 --> 00:01:17.670
 start with percy pay attention to your 

00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:17.670
 fingers 

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:22.909
 you take your needle in your 

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:25.070
 left hand and you are not laying it on 

00:01:22.909 --> 00:01:26.929
 to make wool especially did not arrive 

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:29.210
 not face to risk to plant you 

00:01:26.929 --> 00:01:31.219
 wool in the finger gradually 

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:34.119
 we remove the wool to leave room 

00:01:31.219 --> 00:01:34.119
 at the point 

00:01:37.180 --> 00:01:42.250
 you take it grow with each other 

00:01:38.890 --> 00:01:43.540
 you pull the thread down and you 

00:01:42.250 --> 00:01:46.080
 come put the other needles to 

00:01:43.540 --> 00:01:46.080
 interior 

00:01:55.150 --> 00:01:58.570
 when you pull your son's hand 

00:01:56.980 --> 00:02:00.520
 left should go up and the 

00:01:58.570 --> 00:02:02.200
 right hand down so your 

00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:04.180
 sewing point is correctly placed 

00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:05.740
 now the difference between a 

00:02:04.180 --> 00:02:07.600
 simple sewing and a stitching there it's 

00:02:05.740 --> 00:02:09.640
 to get a simple seam you 

00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:11.020
 always pull the thread down when 

00:02:09.640 --> 00:02:11.470
 you pass the second hand in the 

00:02:11.020 --> 00:02:14.260
 leather 

00:02:11.470 --> 00:02:17.520
 you will thus get a stitch with 

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:17.520
 a right fist on the back 

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:22.470
 on the other hand to obtain a seam 

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:24.030
 weary you will just have to take the 

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:26.190
 son of the arena and to pass him 

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:28.799
 over the eagle at each point of 

00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:30.629
 sewing before pulling this one is 

00:02:28.799 --> 00:02:36.360
 would thus hold an inclined point to 

00:02:30.629 --> 00:02:37.470
 the back here I made the sewing 

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:39.090
 to the end 

00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:40.920
 now I'm going to teach you to 

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:43.230
 to make a point on horseback and three steps in 

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:45.720
 back to reinforce the premiums and 

00:02:43.230 --> 00:02:48.019
 edano couture we start by doing a 

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:48.019
 node 

00:02:53.740 --> 00:02:58.270
 after we change breath we will take a 

00:02:56.140 --> 00:03:00.250
 round just because we're going to iron 

00:02:58.270 --> 00:03:01.690
 in the stitches and with the 

00:03:00.250 --> 00:03:05.830
 wool with tongs one reads what to cut 

00:03:01.690 --> 00:03:08.880
 the thread and you go back to sewing in 

00:03:05.830 --> 00:03:08.880
 back on three points 

00:03:13.730 --> 00:03:18.570
 once your three points made 

00:03:15.990 --> 00:03:20.910
 cut your daughter lara is back in 

00:03:18.570 --> 00:03:23.190

00:03:20.910 --> 00:03:25.760
 hammer riviera on a stone a step 

00:03:23.190 --> 00:03:25.760

 here you see the right seam and at 

00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:37.800
 from there the inclined seam 

00:03:36.900 --> 00:03:40.400
 It's over 

00:03:37.800 --> 00:03:40.400
