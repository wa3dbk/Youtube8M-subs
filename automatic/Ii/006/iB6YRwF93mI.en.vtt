00:00:38.570 --> 00:00:41.650
 in the midst of a blade is a myth 

00:00:42.250 --> 00:00:50.160
 and to take part in this event be like 

00:00:46.720 --> 00:00:53.470
 athlete who is as organizer 

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:54.970
 must be prepared and 

00:00:53.470 --> 00:01:00.430
 certain 

00:00:54.970 --> 00:01:05.400
 but the satisfaction of saying I was there 

00:01:00.430 --> 00:01:11.880
 I think it's priceless ok 

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:14.550
 I did a few years ago I could 

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:18.000
 think of imagining everyone doing it 

00:01:14.550 --> 00:01:20.580
 the years, however, on balance and after almost 

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:23.880
 after almost nine editions 

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:26.390
 I would say that the three-year is all and there 

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:26.390
 is fine 

00:01:36.870 --> 00:01:42.800
 but normally dealing with 

00:01:39.300 --> 00:01:46.890
 tracking is between 15 and 20 guides 

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:50.580
 then the race day on the course 

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:55.260
 we have about 120 people located in 

00:01:50.580 --> 00:01:56.940
 along the whole route they go 

00:01:55.260 --> 00:02:00.540
 precisely by the professionals of the 

00:01:56.940 --> 00:02:02.610
 mountain to alpine rescuers ai 

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:05.970
 doctors to mountain rescue doctors 

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:07.950
 rather than nurses and then too 

00:02:05.970 --> 00:02:11.430
 many volunteers own volunteers of 

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:15.950
 aid vat that lend themselves to giving 

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:15.950
 assistance to athletes 

00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:26.720
 consider the variables in 3 4 days 

00:02:24.349 --> 00:02:29.120
 you can prepare all the well 

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:32.120
 route and also place all the 

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:35.599
 points of iwaki relief points and di 

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:38.379
 refueling however depends a lot on 

00:02:35.599 --> 00:02:38.379
 weather conditions 

00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:46.370
 the first edition I edited 

00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:50.870
 personally it was the state one 

00:02:46.370 --> 00:02:53.140
 that of 97 with 36 37 departing teams 

00:02:50.870 --> 00:02:56.020
 classified 

00:02:53.140 --> 00:03:00.370
 clearly think of having 300 now 

00:02:56.020 --> 00:03:02.920
 on the way the change is enormous 

00:03:00.370 --> 00:03:06.640
 widening the base so much 

00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:09.160
 clearly there was the good and the less 

00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:12.330
 good that you are facing a race 

00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:15.180
 type in mezzala 

00:03:12.330 --> 00:03:17.420
 we remember that this mega rate that 

00:03:15.180 --> 00:03:20.000
 requires mountaineering skills 

00:03:17.420 --> 00:03:22.820
 knowledge of the high mountains 

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:25.910
 and quite evident that it does not have one 

00:03:22.820 --> 00:03:28.610
 great base as like the one you practice 

00:03:25.910 --> 00:03:30.910
 The competitive ski mountaineering now has 

00:03:28.610 --> 00:03:32.710
 inside a bit of everything 

00:03:30.910 --> 00:03:36.060
 but I believe that in the years in between the 

00:03:32.710 --> 00:03:38.140
 my gave some good lessons a 

00:03:36.060 --> 00:03:41.380
 so many that 

00:03:38.140 --> 00:03:44.670
 that maybe they approached him with a 

00:03:41.380 --> 00:03:49.090
 a bit of lightness and we lived 

00:03:44.670 --> 00:03:51.490
 cold editions frozen with 

00:03:49.090 --> 00:03:56.250
 storms and so on and made it clear 

00:03:51.490 --> 00:03:56.250
 to many what the mountain means 

00:03:59.740 --> 00:04:06.290
 mezzala but never ends because 

00:04:03.010 --> 00:04:11.900
 archived the issue the head is already 

00:04:06.290 --> 00:04:14.310
 on the one that will follow things are 

00:04:11.900 --> 00:04:16.850
 so much to do that 

00:04:14.310 --> 00:04:21.440
 I really do not miss the year the year 

00:04:16.850 --> 00:04:21.440
 fly in the middle today it takes
