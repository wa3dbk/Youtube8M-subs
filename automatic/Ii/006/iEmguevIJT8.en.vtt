00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:37.170 
even devices little things that all they

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:39.590 
even devices little things that all they
do<00:00:37.230> is<00:00:37.649> they<00:00:37.890> lift<00:00:38.309> your<00:00:38.550> laptop<00:00:39.059> computer<00:00:39.090> a

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:39.600 
do is they lift your laptop computer a

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:41.959 
do is they lift your laptop computer a
little<00:00:39.930> farther<00:00:40.379> off<00:00:40.739> the<00:00:40.980> desk<00:00:41.219> and<00:00:41.370> they

00:00:41.959 --> 00:00:41.969 
little farther off the desk and they

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:45.319 
little farther off the desk and they
tilt<00:00:42.360> it<00:00:42.600> towards<00:00:43.050> you<00:00:43.230> this<00:00:43.739> is<00:00:43.980> done<00:00:44.280> for<00:00:44.969> one

00:00:45.319 --> 00:00:45.329 
tilt it towards you this is done for one

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:48.500 
tilt it towards you this is done for one
of<00:00:45.360> two<00:00:45.660> reasons<00:00:46.039> one<00:00:47.039> is<00:00:47.370> it's<00:00:47.730> done<00:00:48.000> in<00:00:48.270> order

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:48.510 
of two reasons one is it's done in order

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:51.680 
of two reasons one is it's done in order
to<00:00:48.840> help<00:00:49.079> your<00:00:49.440> laptop<00:00:50.280> computer<00:00:50.309> cool<00:00:51.149> so

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:51.690 
to help your laptop computer cool so

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:53.959 
to help your laptop computer cool so
some<00:00:52.020> laptop<00:00:52.469> computers<00:00:52.949> will<00:00:53.129> run<00:00:53.430> very<00:00:53.730> very

00:00:53.959 --> 00:00:53.969 
some laptop computers will run very very

00:00:53.969 --> 00:00:56.869 
some laptop computers will run very very
hot<00:00:54.270> if<00:00:54.570> they<00:00:54.840> are<00:00:54.960> close<00:00:55.410> to<00:00:55.440> a<00:00:55.800> to<00:00:56.460> a<00:00:56.489> surface

00:00:56.869 --> 00:00:56.879 
hot if they are close to a to a surface

00:00:56.879 --> 00:00:58.819 
hot if they are close to a to a surface
so<00:00:57.210> by<00:00:57.360> lifting<00:00:57.600> them<00:00:57.809> off<00:00:58.020> the<00:00:58.230> surface<00:00:58.620> it

00:00:58.819 --> 00:00:58.829 
so by lifting them off the surface it

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:00.939 
so by lifting them off the surface it
will<00:00:58.949> allow<00:00:59.160> them<00:00:59.430> to<00:00:59.460> cool<00:00:59.730> a<00:00:59.760> little<00:00:59.969> bit<00:01:00.120> and

00:01:00.939 --> 00:01:00.949 
will allow them to cool a little bit and

00:01:00.949 --> 00:01:03.529 
will allow them to cool a little bit and
ergonomically<00:01:01.949> some<00:01:02.430> people<00:01:02.789> like<00:01:03.090> to<00:01:03.300> type

00:01:03.529 --> 00:01:03.539 
ergonomically some people like to type

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:06.320 
ergonomically some people like to type
at<00:01:03.780> a<00:01:03.840> bit<00:01:04.049> of<00:01:04.140> an<00:01:04.229> incline<00:01:04.710> rather<00:01:05.549> than<00:01:05.939> flat

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:06.330 
at a bit of an incline rather than flat

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:09.200 
at a bit of an incline rather than flat
down<00:01:06.600> now<00:01:07.200> again<00:01:07.560> for<00:01:07.979> me<00:01:08.220> on<00:01:08.549> both<00:01:08.909> of<00:01:09.119> those

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:09.210 
down now again for me on both of those

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:12.350 
down now again for me on both of those
counts<00:01:09.479> I<00:01:09.780> don't<00:01:10.260> personally<00:01:10.590> care<00:01:11.250> but<00:01:11.670> what

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:12.360 
counts I don't personally care but what

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:16.580 
counts I don't personally care but what
but<00:01:13.320> I<00:01:13.970> have<00:01:14.970> had<00:01:15.240> clients<00:01:15.540> care<00:01:16.080> about<00:01:16.320> this

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:16.590 
but I have had clients care about this

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:19.550 
but I have had clients care about this
in<00:01:16.740> the<00:01:16.830> past<00:01:17.040> and<00:01:17.520> so<00:01:18.180> I<00:01:18.210> do<00:01:18.479> know<00:01:18.990> this<00:01:19.259> these

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:19.560 
in the past and so I do know this these

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:21.649 
in the past and so I do know this these
types<00:01:19.920> of<00:01:20.189> things<00:01:20.490> are<00:01:20.759> necessary<00:01:21.600> so

00:01:21.649 --> 00:01:21.659 
types of things are necessary so

00:01:21.659 --> 00:01:24.140 
types of things are necessary so
basically<00:01:22.170> what<00:01:22.439> this<00:01:22.619> is<00:01:22.680> is<00:01:23.130> an<00:01:23.490> ultra

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:24.150 
basically what this is is an ultra

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:27.289 
basically what this is is an ultra
portable<00:01:24.689> laptop<00:01:25.619> stand<00:01:25.890> again<00:01:26.580> basically<00:01:27.090> to

00:01:27.289 --> 00:01:27.299 
portable laptop stand again basically to

00:01:27.299 --> 00:01:30.080 
portable laptop stand again basically to
raise<00:01:27.479> your<00:01:27.689> laptop<00:01:28.290> up<00:01:28.470> up<00:01:28.829> off<00:01:29.040> your<00:01:29.520> desk<00:01:29.880> a

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:30.090 
raise your laptop up up off your desk a

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:31.940 
raise your laptop up up off your desk a
little<00:01:30.450> bit<00:01:30.600> so<00:01:30.810> that<00:01:30.960> it<00:01:31.079> can<00:01:31.259> cool<00:01:31.500> better

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:31.950 
little bit so that it can cool better

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:34.550 
little bit so that it can cool better
and<00:01:32.250> also<00:01:32.939> gives<00:01:33.570> you<00:01:33.840> a<00:01:33.869> bit<00:01:34.259> better

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:34.560 
and also gives you a bit better

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:36.980 
and also gives you a bit better
ergonomics<00:01:35.009> so<00:01:35.970> this<00:01:36.240> is<00:01:36.420> really<00:01:36.780> really

00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:36.990 
ergonomics so this is really really

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:39.080 
ergonomics so this is really really
pretty<00:01:37.200> simple<00:01:37.560> so<00:01:37.979> let's<00:01:38.340> go<00:01:38.490> over<00:01:38.820> to<00:01:38.970> my

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:39.090 
pretty simple so let's go over to my

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:41.749 
pretty simple so let's go over to my
little<00:01:39.390> demonstration<00:01:40.200> table<00:01:41.009> so<00:01:41.310> I<00:01:41.340> can<00:01:41.430> just

00:01:41.749 --> 00:01:41.759 
little demonstration table so I can just

00:01:41.759 --> 00:01:43.670 
little demonstration table so I can just
show<00:01:41.850> you<00:01:42.060> what's<00:01:42.479> going<00:01:42.869> on<00:01:43.079> again<00:01:43.409> nothing

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:43.680 
show you what's going on again nothing

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:46.520 
show you what's going on again nothing
overly<00:01:44.490> sophisticated<00:01:44.759> or<00:01:45.360> complicated<00:01:45.930> but

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:46.530 
overly sophisticated or complicated but

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:49.249 
overly sophisticated or complicated but
it's<00:01:47.189> kind<00:01:47.399> of<00:01:47.460> cool<00:01:47.640> so<00:01:48.149> this<00:01:48.509> is<00:01:48.780> the<00:01:49.079> laptop

00:01:49.249 --> 00:01:49.259 
it's kind of cool so this is the laptop

00:01:49.259 --> 00:01:51.200 
it's kind of cool so this is the laptop
stand<00:01:49.680> the<00:01:49.829> reason<00:01:50.159> it's<00:01:50.310> ultra<00:01:50.579> portable<00:01:50.850> is

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:51.210 
stand the reason it's ultra portable is

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:53.330 
stand the reason it's ultra portable is
because<00:01:51.540> it<00:01:51.659> folds<00:01:52.049> down<00:01:52.110> like<00:01:52.680> this<00:01:52.920> as<00:01:53.189> you

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:53.340 
because it folds down like this as you

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:55.219 
because it folds down like this as you
can<00:01:53.490> see<00:01:53.729> it<00:01:54.030> folds<00:01:54.450> down<00:01:54.600> really<00:01:55.140> really

00:01:55.219 --> 00:01:55.229 
can see it folds down really really

00:01:55.229 --> 00:01:57.170 
can see it folds down really really
really<00:01:55.680> really<00:01:55.829> really<00:01:56.340> small<00:01:56.490> you<00:01:56.700> can<00:01:57.000> put

00:01:57.170 --> 00:01:57.180 
really really really small you can put

00:01:57.180 --> 00:01:59.780 
really really really small you can put
this<00:01:57.329> almost<00:01:57.810> anywhere<00:01:58.259> then<00:01:58.770> all<00:01:59.130> you<00:01:59.399> do<00:01:59.610> is

00:01:59.780 --> 00:01:59.790 
this almost anywhere then all you do is

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:01.459 
this almost anywhere then all you do is
it's<00:02:00.240> just<00:02:00.540> kind<00:02:00.750> of<00:02:00.899> like<00:02:01.110> one<00:02:01.320> of<00:02:01.350> these

00:02:01.459 --> 00:02:01.469 
it's just kind of like one of these

00:02:01.469 --> 00:02:03.830 
it's just kind of like one of these
folding<00:02:01.979> things<00:02:02.130> so<00:02:02.729> basically<00:02:02.880> you<00:02:03.299> unfold

00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:03.840 
folding things so basically you unfold

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:06.219 
folding things so basically you unfold
it<00:02:04.079> then<00:02:04.799> all<00:02:04.979> you<00:02:05.130> do<00:02:05.280> is<00:02:05.460> you<00:02:05.579> flip<00:02:05.880> it<00:02:05.909> up

00:02:06.219 --> 00:02:06.229 
it then all you do is you flip it up

00:02:06.229 --> 00:02:09.380 
it then all you do is you flip it up
then<00:02:07.229> from<00:02:07.530> there<00:02:07.770> you<00:02:08.550> flip<00:02:08.819> these<00:02:09.030> down

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:09.390 
then from there you flip these down

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:12.860 
then from there you flip these down
until<00:02:10.200> they<00:02:10.890> go<00:02:11.190> into<00:02:11.430> the<00:02:11.730> little<00:02:11.879> holes

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:12.870 
until they go into the little holes

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:16.009 
until they go into the little holes
and<00:02:12.959> there<00:02:13.260> you<00:02:13.680> go<00:02:13.950> you<00:02:14.400> have<00:02:14.610> a<00:02:14.640> fancy<00:02:15.390> dancy

00:02:16.009 --> 00:02:16.019 
and there you go you have a fancy dancy

00:02:16.019 --> 00:02:19.580 
and there you go you have a fancy dancy
little<00:02:16.760> laptop<00:02:17.760> stand<00:02:18.300> then<00:02:18.690> I<00:02:18.900> have<00:02:19.440> my

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:19.590 
little laptop stand then I have my

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:22.610 
little laptop stand then I have my
laptop<00:02:19.830> computer<00:02:20.280> here<00:02:20.849> all<00:02:21.060> we<00:02:21.390> do<00:02:21.599> is<00:02:22.200> we<00:02:22.410> put

00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:22.620 
laptop computer here all we do is we put

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:24.619 
laptop computer here all we do is we put
this<00:02:22.769> under<00:02:23.340> the<00:02:23.370> laptop<00:02:23.910> computer<00:02:24.390> like<00:02:24.599> that

00:02:24.619 --> 00:02:24.629 
this under the laptop computer like that

00:02:24.629 --> 00:02:28.309 
this under the laptop computer like that
and<00:02:25.170> we<00:02:25.769> can<00:02:25.980> see<00:02:26.010> that<00:02:26.519> yes<00:02:27.120> indeed<00:02:27.330> it<00:02:27.870> lifts

00:02:28.309 --> 00:02:28.319 
and we can see that yes indeed it lifts

00:02:28.319 --> 00:02:30.350 
and we can see that yes indeed it lifts
the<00:02:28.410> laptop<00:02:28.890> computer<00:02:29.310> off<00:02:29.459> the<00:02:29.640> desk<00:02:29.849> and<00:02:30.090> now

00:02:30.350 --> 00:02:30.360 
the laptop computer off the desk and now

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:33.140 
the laptop computer off the desk and now
it<00:02:30.750> changes<00:02:31.290> the<00:02:31.470> ergonomics<00:02:32.220> for<00:02:32.370> being<00:02:32.910> able

00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:33.150 
it changes the ergonomics for being able

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:36.199 
it changes the ergonomics for being able
to<00:02:33.420> type<00:02:33.750> on<00:02:33.950> again<00:02:34.950> I'm<00:02:35.400> not<00:02:35.970> necessarily

00:02:36.199 --> 00:02:36.209 
to type on again I'm not necessarily

00:02:36.209 --> 00:02:38.750 
to type on again I'm not necessarily
saying<00:02:37.080> this<00:02:37.319> is<00:02:37.530> something<00:02:37.799> that<00:02:38.040> I<00:02:38.250> am<00:02:38.549> going

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:38.760 
saying this is something that I am going

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:41.420 
saying this is something that I am going
to<00:02:38.849> be<00:02:39.000> using<00:02:39.360> but<00:02:39.720> I<00:02:39.930> do<00:02:39.989> know<00:02:40.500> for<00:02:40.799> a<00:02:40.860> fact<00:02:40.980> a

00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:41.430 
to be using but I do know for a fact a

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:43.430 
to be using but I do know for a fact a
lot<00:02:41.760> of<00:02:41.790> people<00:02:41.970> like<00:02:42.629> these<00:02:42.810> types<00:02:43.110> of<00:02:43.260> things

00:02:43.430 --> 00:02:43.440 
lot of people like these types of things

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:46.160 
lot of people like these types of things
so<00:02:43.530> this<00:02:43.769> is<00:02:43.980> basically<00:02:44.459> all<00:02:44.760> it<00:02:44.940> is<00:02:45.170> it's

00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:50.730 
sturdy so this is incredibly lightweight

00:02:50.730 --> 00:02:52.910 
sturdy so this is incredibly lightweight
I<00:02:51.090> mean<00:02:51.299> it's<00:02:51.480> I<00:02:51.750> don't<00:02:52.260> know<00:02:52.380> it's<00:02:52.470> a<00:02:52.620> couple

of<00:02:52.980> ounces<00:02:53.190> at<00:02:53.640> most<00:02:53.940> and<00:02:54.930> it<00:02:55.110> really<00:02:55.349> does

00:02:55.640 --> 00:02:55.650 
of ounces at most and it really does

00:02:55.650 --> 00:02:58.759 
of ounces at most and it really does
fold<00:02:55.980> down<00:02:56.160> well<00:02:56.640> so<00:02:56.970> so<00:02:57.299> it's<00:02:57.569> sturdy<00:02:57.930> its

00:02:58.759 --> 00:02:58.769 
fold down well so so it's sturdy its

00:02:58.769 --> 00:03:02.479 
fold down well so so it's sturdy its
stable<00:02:59.400> it<00:03:00.390> looks<00:03:00.720> pretty<00:03:01.049> good<00:03:01.290> I<00:03:01.620> mean<00:03:01.950> again
