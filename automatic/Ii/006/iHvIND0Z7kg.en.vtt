like<00:00:49.590> mine<00:00:49.829> half<00:00:50.449> so<00:00:51.449> the<00:00:51.899> last<00:00:52.140> step<00:00:52.530> is

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:52.710 
like mine half so the last step is

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:55.910 
like mine half so the last step is
frying<00:00:53.280> for<00:00:53.699> that<00:00:53.910> we<00:00:54.480> need<00:00:54.629> very<00:00:54.899> very<00:00:55.559> hot

00:00:55.910 --> 00:00:55.920 
frying for that we need very very hot

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:59.299 
frying for that we need very very hot
oil<00:00:55.949> because<00:00:56.820> we<00:00:56.850> just<00:00:57.539> want<00:00:58.020> that<00:00:58.620> crispy

00:00:59.299 --> 00:00:59.309 
oil because we just want that crispy

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:01.939 
oil because we just want that crispy
crackling<00:00:59.969> coating<00:01:00.480> on<00:01:00.629> the<00:01:00.750> outside<00:01:00.920> so<00:01:01.920> you

00:01:01.939 --> 00:01:01.949 
crackling coating on the outside so you

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:04.130 
crackling coating on the outside so you
need<00:01:02.219> a<00:01:02.250> spiral<00:01:02.789> strainer<00:01:03.059> like<00:01:03.300> this<00:01:03.570> for

00:01:04.130 --> 00:01:04.140 
need a spiral strainer like this for

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:06.500 
need a spiral strainer like this for
frying<00:01:04.409> you<00:01:04.920> can<00:01:05.070> see<00:01:05.369> that<00:01:05.640> I'm<00:01:05.850> using<00:01:06.119> less

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:06.510 
frying you can see that I'm using less

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:09.560 
frying you can see that I'm using less
oil<00:01:06.840> that<00:01:07.290> is<00:01:07.470> the<00:01:07.500> oil<00:01:07.770> is<00:01:08.070> shallow<00:01:08.460> now<00:01:09.360> this

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:09.570 
oil that is the oil is shallow now this

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:11.899 
oil that is the oil is shallow now this
is<00:01:09.689> because<00:01:09.990> corn<00:01:10.380> can<00:01:10.619> pop<00:01:10.860> and<00:01:11.040> hot<00:01:11.430> oil<00:01:11.729> can

00:01:11.899 --> 00:01:11.909 
is because corn can pop and hot oil can

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:14.719 
is because corn can pop and hot oil can
can<00:01:12.540> make<00:01:12.750> a<00:01:12.780> splat<00:01:13.140> and<00:01:13.439> can<00:01:13.770> hurt<00:01:14.040> you<00:01:14.220> it<00:01:14.549> can

00:01:14.719 --> 00:01:14.729 
can make a splat and can hurt you it can

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:16.190 
can make a splat and can hurt you it can
hurt<00:01:14.850> you<00:01:15.030> on<00:01:15.090> your<00:01:15.240> face<00:01:15.420> and<00:01:15.720> it<00:01:15.869> can<00:01:16.020> be<00:01:16.170> a

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:16.200 
hurt you on your face and it can be a

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:18.800 
hurt you on your face and it can be a
disaster<00:01:16.380> this<00:01:17.369> is<00:01:17.520> why<00:01:17.700> the<00:01:18.240> oil<00:01:18.270> is<00:01:18.570> shallow

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:18.810 
disaster this is why the oil is shallow

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:21.830 
disaster this is why the oil is shallow
so<00:01:19.409> this<00:01:19.590> will<00:01:19.740> fry<00:01:20.009> very<00:01:20.820> quickly<00:01:21.119> in<00:01:21.450> just

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:21.840 
so this will fry very quickly in just

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:24.230 
so this will fry very quickly in just
two<00:01:22.170> to<00:01:22.200> four<00:01:22.530> minutes<00:01:22.680> as<00:01:23.040> the<00:01:23.580> flame<00:01:23.820> is<00:01:24.000> very

00:01:24.230 --> 00:01:24.240 
two to four minutes as the flame is very

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:25.880 
two to four minutes as the flame is very
high<00:01:24.509> and<00:01:24.720> they<00:01:25.140> would<00:01:25.259> look<00:01:25.409> something<00:01:25.860> like

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:25.890 
high and they would look something like

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:26.539 
high and they would look something like
this

00:01:26.539 --> 00:01:26.549 
this

00:01:26.549 --> 00:01:37.609 
this
