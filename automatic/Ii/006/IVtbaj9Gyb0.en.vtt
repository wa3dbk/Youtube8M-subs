00:00:10.010 --> 00:00:15.959
 hey people welcome back 

00:00:12.629 --> 00:00:19.080
 last agricultural simulator 2013 

00:00:15.959 --> 00:00:21.450
 with me mac defects so and we have 

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:24.800
 Today you see the whole lot 

00:00:21.450 --> 00:00:26.700
 on board namely the mrn tgx cramp pack 

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:28.530
 and we'll be there soon 

00:00:26.700 --> 00:00:30.690
 Dealer with this pack it 

00:00:28.530 --> 00:00:33.270
 I have two things to do right away 

00:00:30.690 --> 00:00:35.340
 or two packs that are a peg these 

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:35.670
 Krampe trailer and once the ps 0 

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:39.390
 100 

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:41.520
 that just means that's the whole 

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:46.620
 normal so without construction load volume 

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:49.550
 32,900 is 200 so 63,000 is mine 

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:53.510
 really think a real price 

00:00:49.550 --> 00:00:56.910
 so can load everything then we have the 

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:59.700
 bse 900 that is with big construction 

00:00:56.910 --> 00:01:03.270
 then there can load 46 1900 liters 

00:00:59.700 --> 00:01:05.159
 for 73,000 the whole we have that is 

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:06.750
 first the trailer version 2 axles 

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:08.520
 Of course, then we have everything 

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:11.759
 but still as a triangle versions with dre 

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:15.209
 stool and also once with the 

00:01:11.759 --> 00:01:17.969
 construction on top 46 1900 liters and 

00:01:15.209 --> 00:01:20.549
 once around construction 32,900 it almost 

00:01:17.969 --> 00:01:22.200
 the same thing as these only lodge 

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:24.479
 that just have turntable 

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:28.619
 Personally, I find that very cool why 

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:30.359
 that's the way I show you in her 

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:34.139
 propertied look at times because sometimes just pure and 

00:01:30.359 --> 00:01:38.340
 Although serve emma in tgx cramp have 

00:01:34.139 --> 00:01:41.369
 680 ps the capacity of 32,000 100 and 

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:42.719
 I think that almost everything is there 

00:01:41.369 --> 00:01:45.060
 there are two differences without 

00:01:42.719 --> 00:01:47.909
 this construction and here once with this 

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:50.369
 construction without construction with construction right there 

00:01:47.909 --> 00:01:51.899
 without construction, they have 22,100 

00:01:50.369 --> 00:01:57.149
 capacity and as costs 

00:01:51.899 --> 00:01:59.159
 at all at 200,000 I have to say 

00:01:57.149 --> 00:02:03.389
 I think it's a pity because 

00:01:59.159 --> 00:02:09.179
 just here this only this tractor 

00:02:03.389 --> 00:02:12.150
 costs just 220,000 keep 200 

00:02:09.179 --> 00:02:14.580
 euro keeps on every day 680 ps like 

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:15.790
 already said only the capacity 

00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:21.250
 is different 

00:02:15.790 --> 00:02:22.840
 So we see the whole truck s again 

00:02:21.250 --> 00:02:25.060
 of course, everything in different 

00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:26.650
 colors there you can do take 

00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:30.219
 what he wanted is perfect for me 

00:02:26.650 --> 00:02:33.189
 No matter we do not have a big job we do 

00:02:30.219 --> 00:02:35.319
 have no ec taxation because that 

00:02:33.189 --> 00:02:38.319
 namely the handbrake turns the steering wheel 

00:02:35.319 --> 00:02:39.819
 Join in and we have no animated 

00:02:38.319 --> 00:02:41.650
 Tacho too bad a pity 

00:02:39.819 --> 00:02:44.079
 no we do not have an animated star though 

00:02:41.650 --> 00:02:45.760
 the interior 41 is a bit dark 

00:02:44.079 --> 00:02:47.469
 held but relatively successful I 

00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:50.319
 find the buttons the whole separator 

00:02:47.469 --> 00:02:51.939
 you can see everything very well yes 

00:02:50.319 --> 00:02:52.900
 I just think so beautiful the outside 

00:02:51.939 --> 00:02:54.489
 text just let's look again 

00:02:52.900 --> 00:02:56.019
 in short, that actually fits 

00:02:54.489 --> 00:02:58.000
 also on the whole so there 

00:02:56.019 --> 00:02:59.709
 There is nothing to complain about and complain about 

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:02.950
 to complain about meaningless rum that is 

00:02:59.709 --> 00:03:05.049
 just like that fits around well so yes 

00:03:02.950 --> 00:03:06.340
 almost take the single tractor 

00:03:05.049 --> 00:03:07.689
 the good thing is how are you looking 

00:03:06.340 --> 00:03:09.639
 fast which often our quarter mile like 

00:03:07.689 --> 00:03:11.739
 fast the good thing is natural 

00:03:09.639 --> 00:03:14.950
 Above the German position one button 

00:03:11.739 --> 00:03:18.519
 also remake 73 km / h 74 creates 

00:03:14.950 --> 00:03:19.780
 even then, but he is so behind 

00:03:18.519 --> 00:03:24.370
 but of course a steering axle with 

00:03:19.780 --> 00:03:28.120
 installed one and we have of course 

00:03:24.370 --> 00:03:31.090
 also normal low beam and completely 

00:03:28.120 --> 00:03:32.769
 normal dipped beam then still have 

00:03:31.090 --> 00:03:36.810
 on the keys to place six we have 

00:03:32.769 --> 00:03:39.489
 still so come directly to the work light 

00:03:36.810 --> 00:03:43.810
 and otherwise yes the blinkers stop like 

00:03:39.489 --> 00:03:45.489
 always completely normal and now once 

00:03:43.810 --> 00:03:46.810
 the difference to us, I was extra-now 

00:03:45.489 --> 00:03:49.479
 this trailer with purely fetched because the 

00:03:46.810 --> 00:03:50.650
 just super to fit well now to the 

00:03:49.479 --> 00:03:53.409
 maybe not yellow but that too 

00:03:50.650 --> 00:03:55.540
 Never mind that and there for once 

00:03:53.409 --> 00:03:59.379
 individual semi-trailers we have these 

00:03:55.540 --> 00:04:02.949
 Trailer, I find that rather cool this 

00:03:59.379 --> 00:04:07.739
 zweiachser and then have synonymous 

00:04:02.949 --> 00:04:07.739
 moment just for this 

00:04:11.230 --> 00:04:16.370
 Here, where the back is already behind 

00:04:14.510 --> 00:04:21.070
 Trough is also back with two 

00:04:16.370 --> 00:04:21.070
 There are still some axes here 

00:04:21.190 --> 00:04:25.760
 turntable trailer with three axles and 

00:04:24.020 --> 00:04:27.620
 then I have to say that's so good for me 

00:04:25.760 --> 00:04:29.960
 Why do you like that a bit? 

00:04:27.620 --> 00:04:32.120
 the reason why not the models 

00:04:29.960 --> 00:04:34.850
 Blair wanted to have a look 

00:04:32.120 --> 00:04:36.020
 team I think that monkey horny it 

00:04:34.850 --> 00:04:37.730
 Is that really awesome like that? 

00:04:36.020 --> 00:04:40.190
 Looks like this fat behind here 

00:04:37.730 --> 00:04:42.230
 trough so it really comes porn 

00:04:40.190 --> 00:04:44.330
 So you can not say that differently and 

00:04:42.230 --> 00:04:47.750
 I do not even know if it's possible 

00:04:44.330 --> 00:04:48.610
 maybe even one more with you 

00:04:47.750 --> 00:04:57.560
 dranzuhÃ¤ngen 

00:04:48.610 --> 00:04:59.420
 that was cool is driving backwards yes say 

00:04:57.560 --> 00:05:01.160
 I do not care about that now 

00:04:59.420 --> 00:05:03.250
 namely, a science is not a science 

00:05:01.160 --> 00:05:03.250
 Expression 

00:05:06.030 --> 00:05:15.729
 I do not know now if I alter the 

00:05:12.879 --> 00:05:17.409
 even goes even that way and then 

00:05:15.729 --> 00:05:18.189
 Let's see what we have here by team 

00:05:17.409 --> 00:05:22.199
 can grow 

00:05:18.189 --> 00:05:23.919
 that is actually infinitely expandable 

00:05:22.199 --> 00:05:25.569
 right here and come on again 

00:05:23.919 --> 00:05:27.129
 that is theoretical 

00:05:25.569 --> 00:05:29.110
 infinitely expandable also has such a 

00:05:27.129 --> 00:05:30.279
 turn small rolls and I think so 

00:05:29.110 --> 00:05:33.849
 just cool because we have now 

00:05:30.279 --> 00:05:35.319
 already no idea of a capacity of 

00:05:33.849 --> 00:05:38.379
 100,000 one now here 

00:05:35.319 --> 00:05:40.990
 can transport you watch the times 

00:05:38.379 --> 00:05:43.659
 on that's something mega cool of and 

00:05:40.990 --> 00:05:46.300
 the truck has 680 ps the thick so it 

00:05:43.659 --> 00:05:48.180
 Do not even bother us so cooks 

00:05:46.300 --> 00:05:50.650
 60 and still managed without problems 

00:05:48.180 --> 00:05:55.330
 also makes his 70 do any 

00:05:50.650 --> 00:05:57.279
 bet it did not work anymore though 

00:05:55.330 --> 00:06:00.669
 really cool so I think that's right 

00:05:57.279 --> 00:06:02.650
 really cool just awesome if you 

00:06:00.669 --> 00:06:03.550
 so as well as I like it then 

00:06:02.650 --> 00:06:05.020
 Just have a look at the video 

00:06:03.550 --> 00:06:07.449
 description after there you both find 

00:06:05.020 --> 00:06:11.289
 download links once the trailer leads 

00:06:07.449 --> 00:06:17.379
 pack and once for the nt gx that that 

00:06:11.289 --> 00:06:18.580
 Comeback quasi and otherwise means now 

00:06:17.379 --> 00:06:20.199
 only if you liked one 

00:06:18.580 --> 00:06:20.680
 Thumbs dalassen has favored that 

00:06:20.199 --> 00:06:22.029
 Video 

00:06:20.680 --> 00:06:23.500
 if he support me a bit 

00:06:22.029 --> 00:06:25.089
 I want to subscribe to the latest ones 

00:06:23.500 --> 00:06:30.449
 easy and from my breast as always 

00:06:25.089 --> 00:06:30.449
 still a fat until next time
