00:00:06.910 --> 00:00:11.200
 good night we started the wheel of 

00:00:09.040 --> 00:00:12.850
 press of the real crosshead technician 

00:00:11.200 --> 00:00:15.190
 we ask the question please through 

00:00:12.850 --> 00:00:17.969
 of the microphones pointing to name and 

00:00:15.190 --> 00:00:17.969
 half thanks 

00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:21.200
 hello amig the radio evangelist 

00:00:19.490 --> 00:00:23.240
 national 

00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:25.040
 well it could have happened of all but 

00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:27.279
 the one that has been most effective has been its 

00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:27.279
 team 

00:00:28.870 --> 00:00:33.450
 yes 

00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:35.190
 if you hear yes yes 

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:36.840
 so it could have come from everything 

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:37.980
 like most first-rate matches 

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:40.350
 division 

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:46.550
 last week I have a very good 

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:46.550
 our match win and we get very 

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:52.240
 all right 

00:00:50.110 --> 00:00:53.650
 in a first part in which he has 

00:00:52.240 --> 00:00:55.870
 cost more we have suffered mostly 

00:00:53.650 --> 00:00:57.829
 nations 

00:00:55.870 --> 00:01:00.409
 and the president 

00:00:57.829 --> 00:01:03.159
 of the betis cost us in the second 

00:01:00.409 --> 00:01:05.180
 we also had the possible 

00:01:03.159 --> 00:01:07.460
 tiredness after having played a 

00:01:05.180 --> 00:01:09.920
 match between week and the subsequent 

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:13.280
 trip and we have been effective in these 

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:14.840
 last in that last phase of the match and 

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:17.210
 that victory is very good for us 

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:19.789
 it's great to start winning outside 

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:21.289
 of house a hopeful data for 

00:01:19.789 --> 00:01:23.710
 we hope to confirm in the 

00:01:21.289 --> 00:01:23.710
 next days 

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:37.620
 good night congratulations for your first 

00:01:35.190 --> 00:01:39.960
 victory in first division as has 

00:01:37.620 --> 00:01:41.220
 felt on that bench that today is 

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:43.590
 premiered in the Benito Villamarín and that 

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:46.259
 said to miss me before I started 

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:49.020
 nothing else the smell as always 

00:01:46.259 --> 00:01:51.329
 I agree with him in a very affectionate way 

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:53.399
 and I did not know they were new benches or 

00:01:51.329 --> 00:01:54.719
 I was looking when I came out 

00:01:53.399 --> 00:01:56.819
 to the field on the right and I've seen the 

00:01:54.719 --> 00:01:58.890
 those who were old from autumn how has 

00:01:56.819 --> 00:02:00.840
 changed was worse and then look at 

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:02.320
 another side and brother is much better 

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:05.490
 to the bench 

00:02:02.320 --> 00:02:08.759
 tidy maybe but 

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:10.890
 but well good enough better about 

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:13.410
 that this field is coming, so always 

00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:14.580
 it's nice to come this is a field that 

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:17.160
 I'm particularly good at 

00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:20.360
 when I was playing and today as a coach 

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:20.360
 It has also been like that 

00:02:36.460 --> 00:02:41.560
 exact was one thing we had talked about 

00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:42.670
 during the week it was one thing that we 

00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:44.350
 we posed we did not know 

00:02:42.670 --> 00:02:46.210
 obviously the result because this 

00:02:44.350 --> 00:02:49.830
 it's a very difficult field but 

00:02:46.210 --> 00:02:51.690
 We wanted to show the same image 

00:02:49.830 --> 00:02:54.600
 in the two defensive and offensive phases 

00:02:51.690 --> 00:02:56.820
 what we did on the first day and I think 

00:02:54.600 --> 00:02:59.520
 that the players have been in the 

00:02:56.820 --> 00:03:01.050
 level that was required then the little ones 

00:02:59.520 --> 00:03:03.240
 details to those who have sentenced that 

00:03:01.050 --> 00:03:05.760
 the match was for us 

00:03:03.240 --> 00:03:08.610
 and it 's a good first step but it's not 

00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:11.400
 means nothing are still many 

00:03:08.610 --> 00:03:13.290
 days and away from home and home to me 

00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:15.890
 I would like the team to have the 

00:03:13.290 --> 00:03:15.890
 same identity 

00:03:15.990 --> 00:03:19.670
 to questions here 

00:03:19.970 --> 00:03:24.920
 and this knowledge that the betis 

00:03:22.250 --> 00:03:27.800
 he was in defense 

00:03:24.920 --> 00:03:30.470
 in a state 

00:03:27.800 --> 00:03:33.050
 of a low level and that has shown 

00:03:30.470 --> 00:03:34.250
 in the previous match in europe and today 

00:03:33.050 --> 00:03:37.940
 he has also shown it with his team 

00:03:34.250 --> 00:03:41.230
 it's okay I knew you had that detail 

00:03:37.940 --> 00:03:44.570
 man we do an exhaustive 

00:03:41.230 --> 00:03:45.950
 exam of the rival and we have seen all the 

00:03:44.570 --> 00:03:47.990
 matches although in these first 

00:03:45.950 --> 00:03:50.990
 days we have evident of the betis 

00:03:47.990 --> 00:03:53.660
 we had the good game played out of 

00:03:50.990 --> 00:03:55.510
 house in the at everton's house in the 

00:03:53.660 --> 00:03:58.269
 bernabéu 

00:03:55.510 --> 00:04:00.310
 well I have not seen those shortcomings of 

00:03:58.269 --> 00:04:01.629
 which of the series I see that they have a 

00:04:00.310 --> 00:04:03.440
 very balanced template a good 

00:04:01.629 --> 00:04:05.270
 template 

00:04:03.440 --> 00:04:08.090
 It is premature to draw conclusions after 

00:04:05.270 --> 00:04:11.569
 of two days of league and 

00:04:08.090 --> 00:04:14.540
 it's not being a very difficult field for 

00:04:11.569 --> 00:04:16.130
 the rivals and betis I've seen 

00:04:14.540 --> 00:04:18.590
 until now I liked it seems like a 

00:04:16.130 --> 00:04:21.199
 team that responds to the identity of what 

00:04:18.590 --> 00:04:22.950
 who wants his coach and it seems like a 

00:04:21.199 --> 00:04:24.870
 very good team 

00:04:22.950 --> 00:04:27.480
 jose miguel muñoz the number one export 

00:04:24.870 --> 00:04:29.430
 one night mister believes that absence 

00:04:27.480 --> 00:04:30.540
 of the beginning of a rubén castro that does not 

00:04:29.430 --> 00:04:32.850
 He arrived at its best by 

00:04:30.540 --> 00:04:34.290
 injury he could weigh too much 

00:04:32.850 --> 00:04:36.480
 notes a lot of change regarding the 

00:04:34.290 --> 00:04:37.740
 exit by the reference and I tell you more 

00:04:36.480 --> 00:04:40.320
 that a player of that importance swims 

00:04:37.740 --> 00:04:42.569
 hand robben cases or players that brand 

00:04:40.320 --> 00:04:44.610
 the difference whenever he plays but 

00:04:42.569 --> 00:04:46.830
 to the Jorge Molina station behind 

00:04:44.610 --> 00:04:48.360
 verdú with cedric and juanfran juan carlos 

00:04:46.830 --> 00:04:50.310
 today 

00:04:48.360 --> 00:04:52.189
 they have different different options 

00:04:50.310 --> 00:04:55.379
 possibilities can also serve brian 

00:04:52.189 --> 00:04:57.740
 has left 81 that is, we are talking about 

00:04:55.379 --> 00:05:00.360
 a template I think quite compensated and 

00:04:57.740 --> 00:05:02.069
 with enough quality that he then plays 

00:05:00.360 --> 00:05:04.500
 one or the other there are many times that depends 

00:05:02.069 --> 00:05:07.289
 of the day they bring very well is a player 

00:05:04.500 --> 00:05:09.300
 that always generates problems of the 

00:05:07.289 --> 00:05:12.060
 opposing defenses for their mobility 

00:05:09.300 --> 00:05:14.099
 for his presence by his arrival 

00:05:12.060 --> 00:05:16.219
 to the area and good 

00:05:14.099 --> 00:05:18.870
 in the end we value 

00:05:16.219 --> 00:05:20.250
 change the systems or change the 

00:05:18.870 --> 00:05:22.439
 approaches according to the 

00:05:20.250 --> 00:05:23.580
 individualities but any of the 

00:05:22.439 --> 00:05:26.689
 what would have played would have generated us 

00:05:23.580 --> 00:05:26.689
 also problems 

00:05:26.849 --> 00:05:31.850
 any other question 

00:05:28.950 --> 00:05:31.850
 Thank you so much
