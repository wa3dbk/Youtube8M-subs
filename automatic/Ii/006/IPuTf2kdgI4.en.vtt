and<00:01:17.479> hate<00:01:17.720> or<00:01:17.990> anything<00:01:19.360> but<00:01:20.360> I<00:01:21.759> figured<00:01:22.759> out

00:01:22.899 --> 00:01:22.909 
and hate or anything but I figured out

00:01:22.909 --> 00:01:24.940 
and hate or anything but I figured out
just<00:01:23.150> by<00:01:23.270> searching<00:01:23.450> and<00:01:23.900> seen<00:01:24.170> look<00:01:24.740> just

00:01:24.940 --> 00:01:24.950 
just by searching and seen look just

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:26.620 
just by searching and seen look just
looking<00:01:25.220> at<00:01:25.340> the<00:01:25.579> progress<00:01:25.820> and<00:01:26.180> how<00:01:26.390> they're

00:01:26.620 --> 00:01:26.630 
looking at the progress and how they're

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:32.170 
looking at the progress and how they're
doing<00:01:27.189> the<00:01:28.189> motion<00:01:28.579> workers<00:01:29.140> my<00:01:30.140> guess<00:01:30.439> is<00:01:31.180> it

00:01:32.170 --> 00:01:32.180 
doing the motion workers my guess is it

00:01:32.180 --> 00:01:35.289 
doing the motion workers my guess is it
should<00:01:32.869> be<00:01:32.960> out<00:01:33.110> in<00:01:33.320> November<00:01:34.100> and<00:01:34.280> this<00:01:35.180> is

00:01:35.289 --> 00:01:35.299 
should be out in November and this is

00:01:35.299 --> 00:01:37.359 
should be out in November and this is
going<00:01:35.450> to<00:01:35.540> be<00:01:35.600> the<00:01:35.750> next<00:01:36.130> basically<00:01:37.130> the

00:01:37.359 --> 00:01:37.369 
going to be the next basically the

00:01:37.369 --> 00:01:39.940 
going to be the next basically the
biggest<00:01:37.729> update<00:01:38.030> ever<00:01:38.450> to<00:01:38.689> hit<00:01:38.950> Minecraft

00:02:08.850 --> 00:02:08.860 
that's kind of going to be a long time

00:02:08.860 --> 00:02:11.950 
that's kind of going to be a long time
you're<00:02:09.860> kind<00:02:10.490> of<00:02:10.580> right<00:02:10.759> but<00:02:11.540> just<00:02:11.720> remember

00:02:11.950 --> 00:02:11.960

00:02:19.660 --> 00:02:19.670 
it's like a huge update so i'm not sure

00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:21.339 
it's like a huge update so i'm not sure
if<00:02:19.760> they<00:02:19.879> even<00:02:20.030> have<00:02:20.330> anything<00:02:20.599> a<00:02:20.930> hundred

00:02:21.339 --> 00:02:21.349 
if they even have anything a hundred

00:02:21.349 --> 00:02:22.150 
if they even have anything a hundred
percent<00:02:21.470> done

00:02:22.150 --> 00:02:22.160 
percent done

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:25.810 
percent done
or<00:02:23.150> stuff<00:02:23.390> like<00:02:23.600> that<00:02:24.160> but<00:02:25.160> you<00:02:25.310> can<00:02:25.460> keep<00:02:25.580> on

00:02:25.810 --> 00:02:25.820 
or stuff like that but you can keep on

00:02:25.820 --> 00:02:27.370 
or stuff like that but you can keep on
looking<00:02:26.120> around<00:02:26.300> I<00:02:26.420> know<00:02:26.480> like<00:02:26.900> there's<00:02:27.110> one

00:02:27.370 --> 00:02:27.380 
looking around I know like there's one

00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:30.010 
looking around I know like there's one
website<00:02:27.710> who<00:02:28.220> they<00:02:28.430> have<00:02:29.270> like<00:02:29.480> a<00:02:29.510> countdown

00:02:30.010 --> 00:02:30.020 
website who they have like a countdown

00:02:30.020 --> 00:02:34.030 
website who they have like a countdown
or<00:02:30.350> something<00:02:31.720> that<00:02:32.720> said<00:02:32.930> like<00:02:33.110> 40<00:02:33.590> days<00:02:33.770> I

00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:34.040 
or something that said like 40 days I

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:36.970 
or something that said like 40 days I
think<00:02:34.690> but<00:02:35.690> my<00:02:35.990> guess<00:02:36.050> it's<00:02:36.440> going<00:02:36.620> to<00:02:36.680> be<00:02:36.830> out

00:02:36.970 --> 00:02:36.980 
think but my guess it's going to be out

00:02:36.980 --> 00:02:40.290 
think but my guess it's going to be out
november<00:02:37.880> from<00:02:38.180> the<00:02:38.360> progress<00:02:38.570> they<00:02:39.170> do<00:02:39.230> and

00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:40.300 
november from the progress they do and

00:02:40.300 --> 00:02:43.900 
november from the progress they do and
just<00:02:41.300> by<00:02:41.630> probably<00:02:42.200> how<00:02:42.410> many<00:02:42.650> delays<00:02:43.640> are

00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:43.910 
just by probably how many delays are

00:02:43.910 --> 00:02:46.150 
just by probably how many delays are
going<00:02:44.060> to<00:02:44.150> end<00:02:44.300> up<00:02:44.360> having<00:02:44.920> because<00:02:45.920> there's

00:02:46.150 --> 00:02:46.160 
going to end up having because there's

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:47.620 
going to end up having because there's
