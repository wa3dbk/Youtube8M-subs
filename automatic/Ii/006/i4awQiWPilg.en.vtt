00:00:15.239 --> 00:00:21.850
 I am an absolutely intense guy in 700 and I am very agitated. I graduated in journalism 

00:00:21.849 --> 00:00:24.849
 to all musician than a single man 

00:00:27.099 --> 00:00:30.099
 It's simple 

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:34.769
 plays a lot of guitar but over time on the computer that is a blog 

00:00:35.410 --> 00:00:39.180
 I love writing it I really like to walk in some places here in the village. 

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:41.020
 I'm very out of time, I'm paying. 

00:00:41.020 --> 00:00:42.370
 do not stop because 

00:00:42.370 --> 00:00:45.370
 my son can not stand it any more 

00:00:47.790 --> 00:00:49.720
 a year and I feel like a beautiful person. 

00:00:49.720 --> 00:00:51.680
 You're embarrassed when you talk about this. 

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:52.910
 but 

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:56.030
 so talking so mighty beautiful it all started in soccer city thunder 

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:02.620
 I think if I had to be a guitar player I would have to have another personality because 

00:01:02.620 --> 00:01:03.780
 the dudes 

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:07.100
 who make classical music did not play in that country today 

00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:10.860
 are the aficionados like that and I did not feel like doing it either 

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:13.750
 despite being very close to the instrument in Kenya 

00:01:13.750 --> 00:01:18.230
 stay a disciplined life rule says attacker every day and finish 

00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:20.920
 my social life 'de alquéres quesito né 

00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:23.450
 but has a certain frustration of not being a musician 

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:26.479
 It's something that solves nothing said I have access very musician brings 

00:01:26.479 --> 00:01:27.950
 journalist others 

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:30.950
 france - the actor 

00:01:31.980 --> 00:01:36.060
 I try to make these people my friends the Pope speaks to everyone always 

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:39.060
 more but I think the feeling that 

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:45.570
 recording that there is nothing like that when they try to get out of this 

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:46.280
 plan 

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:48.140
 superficial relationship 

00:01:48.140 --> 00:01:51.110
 we can have somebody unaware as soon as we can 

00:01:51.110 --> 00:01:53.400
 the measure as I met in 67 

00:01:53.400 --> 00:01:56.400
 Beautiful friend started to move too, it's part of my life. 

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:00.750
 I sent my resume to the producer. 

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:04.290
 for the organization of the program and I was very unhappy about it because I 

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:07.060
 already knew that he was going to do a work that was not related because he does not want the 

00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:08.989
 producer decided that I would be 

00:02:08.989 --> 00:02:09.919
 artist 

00:02:09.919 --> 00:02:12.769
 and I got to work, hey, I came. 

00:02:12.769 --> 00:02:14.900
 the production meeting but I can not 

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:17.859
 work with it there you reporter 

00:02:17.859 --> 00:02:21.749
 or do not do anything that worries us was very expensive stick but that was already if 

00:02:21.749 --> 00:02:22.269
 Warm 

00:02:22.269 --> 00:02:23.360
 that we have 

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:26.720
 he did two tests very involved risk of peaking 

00:02:31.639 --> 00:02:35.369
 The real thing is that I have a lot of my time to do if you want 

00:02:35.369 --> 00:02:39.859
 look for danilo the own cheap raffle they have parallel careers that are 

00:02:39.859 --> 00:02:41.510
 very solid so standart 

00:02:41.510 --> 00:02:45.460
 they have even had to press so that is a little available in 

00:02:45.459 --> 00:02:46.759
 relation to him 

00:02:46.759 --> 00:02:50.849
 my reality is much more time available for recording than 

00:02:50.849 --> 00:02:51.950
 the danilo for example 

00:02:51.950 --> 00:02:55.360
 I do not want to enter into the merit of who is better that there is no such competition 

00:02:55.360 --> 00:02:56.389
 if you want 

00:02:56.389 --> 00:02:59.389
 are different profiles and everyone is fanatical about the other's work 

00:02:59.949 --> 00:03:01.669
 now availability 

00:03:01.669 --> 00:03:06.140
 is bigger for me the cinema for others polarized to whom it is a great pleasure 

00:03:06.140 --> 00:03:07.989
 talk to you state 

00:03:07.989 --> 00:03:10.989
 a little more in the world who 

00:03:11.729 --> 00:03:12.959
 and also 

00:03:12.959 --> 00:03:13.799
 joy
