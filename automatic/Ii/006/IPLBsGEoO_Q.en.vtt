to be the air mata and then to my left
the<00:01:59.969> one<00:02:00.119> that's<00:02:00.270> kind<00:02:00.479> of<00:02:00.540> the<00:02:00.630> Goldilocks

the one that's kind of the Goldilocks
right<00:02:01.409> in<00:02:01.500> the<00:02:01.560> middle<00:02:01.740> which<00:02:02.130> is<00:02:02.159> kind<00:02:02.520> of

that<00:02:02.759> that<00:02:03.149> true<00:02:03.450> intermediate<00:02:03.689> is<00:02:04.079> going<00:02:04.560> to

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:04.680 
that that true intermediate is going to

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:06.080 
that that true intermediate is going to
be<00:02:04.829> the<00:02:04.979> variance<00:02:05.369> so<00:02:05.520> keep<00:02:05.670> that<00:02:05.820> in<00:02:05.939> mind

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:06.090

account<00:02:47.310> air<00:02:47.580> flow<00:02:47.790> in<00:02:47.970> their<00:02:48.240> design<00:02:48.630> now<00:02:49.080> I'm

00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:49.170 
account air flow in their design now I'm

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:50.600 
account air flow in their design now I'm
gonna<00:02:49.260> start<00:02:49.590> with<00:02:49.740> the<00:02:49.860> granddad<00:02:50.310> in<00:02:50.459> this

00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:50.610 
gonna start with the granddad in this

00:02:50.610 --> 00:02:52.100 
gonna start with the granddad in this
line<00:02:50.850> up<00:02:51.060> these<00:02:51.330> two<00:02:51.390> helmets<00:02:51.720> have<00:02:51.930> been<00:02:52.080> a

00:02:52.100 --> 00:02:52.110 
line up these two helmets have been a

00:02:52.110 --> 00:02:53.479 
line up these two helmets have been a
little<00:02:52.530> bit<00:02:52.620> newer<00:02:52.770> in<00:02:52.890> the<00:02:52.980> last<00:02:53.130> few<00:02:53.280> years

00:02:53.479 --> 00:02:53.489 
little bit newer in the last few years

00:02:53.489 --> 00:02:55.640 
little bit newer in the last few years
the<00:02:53.820> airframe<00:02:54.150> has<00:02:54.330> been<00:02:54.480> a<00:02:54.510> staple<00:02:54.870> tri<00:02:55.350> comp

00:02:55.640 --> 00:02:55.650 
the airframe has been a staple tri comp

00:02:55.650 --> 00:02:57.080 
the airframe has been a staple tri comp
matrix<00:02:56.100> so<00:02:56.430> it<00:02:56.520> means<00:02:56.610> it's<00:02:56.790> going<00:02:56.910> to<00:02:57.000> be<00:02:57.060> a

00:02:57.080 --> 00:02:57.090 
matrix so it means it's going to be a

00:02:57.090 --> 00:02:59.870 
matrix so it means it's going to be a
fiberglass<00:02:57.660> composite<00:02:57.810> shell<00:02:58.470> the<00:02:59.370> airframe

00:02:59.870 --> 00:02:59.880 
fiberglass composite shell the airframe

00:02:59.880 --> 00:03:01.880 
fiberglass composite shell the airframe
was<00:03:00.090> the<00:03:00.209> first<00:03:00.420> to<00:03:00.600> use<00:03:00.810> a<00:03:00.959> really<00:03:01.530> newly

00:03:01.880 --> 00:03:01.890 
was the first to use a really newly

00:03:01.890 --> 00:03:03.620 
was the first to use a really newly
styled<00:03:02.070> integrated<00:03:02.730> ventilation<00:03:03.209> scheme<00:03:03.390> and

00:03:03.620 --> 00:03:03.630 
styled integrated ventilation scheme and

00:03:03.630 --> 00:03:04.880 
styled integrated ventilation scheme and
here<00:03:03.810> you<00:03:03.900> can<00:03:04.020> see<00:03:04.140> this<00:03:04.260> is<00:03:04.380> the<00:03:04.470> our<00:03:04.590> our

00:03:04.880 --> 00:03:04.890 
here you can see this is the our our

00:03:04.890 --> 00:03:06.920 
here you can see this is the our our
carbon<00:03:05.370> fiber<00:03:05.520> version<00:03:05.850> there<00:03:06.360> are<00:03:06.390> regular

00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:06.930 
carbon fiber version there are regular

00:03:06.930 --> 00:03:08.180 
carbon fiber version there are regular
versions<00:03:07.350> as<00:03:07.500> well<00:03:07.800> you're<00:03:07.920> gonna<00:03:08.010> pay<00:03:08.160> a

00:03:08.180 --> 00:03:08.190 
versions as well you're gonna pay a

00:03:08.190 --> 00:03:09.920 
versions as well you're gonna pay a
little<00:03:08.340> bit<00:03:08.459> more<00:03:08.670> for<00:03:08.880> the<00:03:08.940> carbon<00:03:09.239> fiber<00:03:09.450> but

00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:09.930 
little bit more for the carbon fiber but

00:03:09.930 --> 00:03:11.240 
little bit more for the carbon fiber but
again<00:03:10.110> very<00:03:10.350> aggressive<00:03:10.739> in<00:03:10.800> the<00:03:10.920> shape<00:03:11.100> and

00:03:11.240 --> 00:03:11.250 
again very aggressive in the shape and

00:03:11.250 --> 00:03:12.650 
again very aggressive in the shape and
keep<00:03:11.459> in<00:03:11.580> mind<00:03:11.610> it's<00:03:11.880> more<00:03:12.000> of<00:03:12.060> a<00:03:12.120> neutral<00:03:12.480> fit

00:03:12.650 --> 00:03:12.660 
keep in mind it's more of a neutral fit

00:03:12.660 --> 00:03:13.970 
keep in mind it's more of a neutral fit
so<00:03:12.810> guys<00:03:12.959> are<00:03:13.110> the<00:03:13.170> rounder<00:03:13.440> heads<00:03:13.650> the

00:03:13.970 --> 00:03:13.980 
so guys are the rounder heads the

00:03:13.980 --> 00:03:15.380 
so guys are the rounder heads the
airframe<00:03:14.280> is<00:03:14.370> gonna<00:03:14.520> be<00:03:14.670> a<00:03:14.700> great<00:03:14.940> option

00:03:15.380 --> 00:03:15.390 
airframe is gonna be a great option

00:03:15.390 --> 00:03:16.880 
airframe is gonna be a great option
being<00:03:15.750> that<00:03:15.870> it's<00:03:16.020> tri<00:03:16.230> composite<00:03:16.709> -<00:03:16.800> it's

00:03:16.880 --> 00:03:16.890 
being that it's tri composite - it's

00:03:16.890 --> 00:03:18.410 
being that it's tri composite - it's
gonna<00:03:17.010> be<00:03:17.160> a<00:03:17.190> little<00:03:17.310> bit<00:03:17.520> lighter<00:03:17.730> moving<00:03:18.360> to

00:03:18.410 --> 00:03:18.420 
gonna be a little bit lighter moving to

00:03:18.420 --> 00:03:19.430 
gonna be a little bit lighter moving to

00:03:31.310 --> 00:03:31.320 
DNA from a ventilation standpoint as we

00:03:31.320 --> 00:03:32.360 
DNA from a ventilation standpoint as we
see<00:03:31.500> in<00:03:31.620> the<00:03:31.680> airframe<00:03:32.010> they've<00:03:32.190> actually

00:03:32.360 --> 00:03:32.370 
see in the airframe they've actually

00:03:32.370 --> 00:03:34.130 
see in the airframe they've actually
even<00:03:32.790> added<00:03:33.090> a<00:03:33.180> few<00:03:33.360> more<00:03:33.420> events<00:03:33.870> which<00:03:33.989> is<00:03:34.110> a

00:03:34.130 --> 00:03:34.140 
even added a few more events which is a

00:03:34.140 --> 00:03:36.110 
even added a few more events which is a
nice<00:03:34.350> touch<00:03:34.380> what<00:03:34.920> I<00:03:34.950> really<00:03:35.430> like<00:03:35.640> about<00:03:35.790> the

nice touch what I really like about the
about<00:03:36.570> the<00:03:36.900> air<00:03:37.140> mata<00:03:37.500> is<00:03:37.920> it's<00:03:38.190> a<00:03:38.250> very

00:03:38.420 --> 00:03:38.430 
about the air mata is it's a very

00:03:38.430 --> 00:03:40.610 
about the air mata is it's a very
