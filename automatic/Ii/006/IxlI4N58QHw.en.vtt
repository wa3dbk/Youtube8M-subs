00:00:02.480 --> 00:00:06.460
 March net profit of 6 Nov million euros for the previous financial year 

00:00:06.460 --> 00:00:09.079
 with that for training actually 

00:00:09.079 --> 00:00:13.199
 well somewhat well he drives like a little earlier from katrien one 

00:00:13.199 --> 00:00:16.499
 number 3 2 are moving and moritz are leading loans 

00:00:17.579 --> 00:00:20.809
 how is that if you are for the army that is the financial rehabilitation 

00:00:20.809 --> 00:00:23.609
 is faster than perhaps ever thought 

00:00:23.609 --> 00:00:26.769
 the old the baker boss lands with the friends of feyenoord the 

00:00:26.769 --> 00:00:29.869
 capital injection we have swallowed the last fifteen months 

00:00:29.869 --> 00:00:31.710
 had transfer income 

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:35.120
 the sporting achievements of the past season have the sales do 

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:38.949
 rise and the has been around for three years in he said budget discipline all have 

00:00:38.949 --> 00:00:39.820
 departments 

00:00:39.820 --> 00:00:42.860
 If there is a compliment then to all those people you meet at Feyenoord 

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:46.700
 and those 4 ingredients that made us right there now 

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:49.839
 its value yes two years ago we went we thought we could be 

00:00:49.839 --> 00:00:53.539
 now the amount is split into two parts made up of two parts 

00:00:53.539 --> 00:00:54.720
 built up and 

00:00:54.720 --> 00:00:58.190
 a portion of transfer proceeds and a positive result from pa 

00:00:58.190 --> 00:01:01.190
 business operations what is the relationship between those two amounts 

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:04.940
 both are black numbers, the operational result is it 

00:01:04.940 --> 00:01:08.390
 operating profit just revenue min costs is one 

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:12.250
 point 7 million and the transfer is the aed is the four points 8 million and that makes 

00:01:12.250 --> 00:01:16.450
 together animals that already mentioned 16 2 million and for the first time are both 

00:01:16.450 --> 00:01:17.610
 are you with the sport 

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:21.190
 eindhoven the transfer proceeds it concerns deeper fer and wine balance in particular 

00:01:21.190 --> 00:01:22.350
 or also to other players 

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:25.740
 no I am going to hear more and leroy fer and wijnaldum but also those young players 

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:28.710
 that the English go then also sit certain good seats that were there 

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:32.060
 is a few that also jojo me for me and it is once there are 

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:33.310
 let us know this 

00:01:33.310 --> 00:01:35.660
 and more importantly not flans and el ahmadi years 

00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:40.150
 no they fall in the financial years 12 13 so that will contribute to the old ones 

00:01:40.150 --> 00:01:43.110
 positive result of this season because we think about that too 

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:45.760
 balance an emphatic toys that come out 

00:01:45.760 --> 00:01:47.330
 we have already achieved 

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:51.310
 media and so immersed in this situation but still very important 

00:01:51.310 --> 00:01:54.950
 there was in short a substantial deficit amounted to both built up than to have 

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:57.460
 the friends of feyenoord with pim blokland as captain 30 million 

00:01:57.460 --> 00:02:01.220
 picked up and many players have been sold the last few years is the fault 

00:02:01.220 --> 00:02:05.299
 now almost gone then a logical reasoning yes the blame is now just 

00:02:05.299 --> 00:02:10.120
 minded from 43 million to that 11 million and just below 

00:02:10.120 --> 00:02:13.570
 And in some people I think that you are all those things from friends of 

00:02:13.570 --> 00:02:15.619
 can prepare feyenoord transfers 

00:02:15.619 --> 00:02:18.729
 but the money from winning feyenoord this is also different 

00:02:18.729 --> 00:02:22.829
 is partly new money also partly conversion of debts with transfers you need 

00:02:22.829 --> 00:02:23.979
 take into account 

00:02:23.979 --> 00:02:27.429
 everyone knows he counts us all so where already 50 cents lost than in the series 

00:02:27.429 --> 00:02:30.919
 it had first given this the separation of the players' commissions 

00:02:30.919 --> 00:02:34.099
 of the case in which the sign applies that all go from the net bunch will it 

00:02:34.099 --> 00:02:35.150
 for things like that 

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:38.750
 yes that all goes on and so we also have the first year of the cover 

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:39.699
 another loss 

00:02:39.699 --> 00:02:43.199
 so those three elements make you calculate that very easy 

00:02:43.199 --> 00:02:46.090
 zernike make flowers per a debt conversion 

00:02:46.090 --> 00:02:49.660
 To make people tangible, the club has turned its guilders into shares 

00:02:49.660 --> 00:02:53.540
 that way that's right yes that's right you expect another one this season 

00:02:53.540 --> 00:02:57.160
 positive result than even better positive result operation top 

00:02:57.160 --> 00:03:00.129
 kill operation so to speak out so again operating result me 

00:03:00.129 --> 00:03:01.219
 think that in the lead 

00:03:01.219 --> 00:03:05.290
 from this year it is therefore a round peat in Europe coming through two tons of 

00:03:05.289 --> 00:03:07.699
 construction is being trained to transfer our state 

00:03:07.699 --> 00:03:11.279
 is difficult to estimate, we can do another January transfer window, both can also 

00:03:11.279 --> 00:03:12.969
 June what happened 

00:03:12.969 --> 00:03:16.819
 We will be gates convinced that it will be twice the numbers and got 

00:03:16.819 --> 00:03:20.089
 you also a penny when debt must be free is that a short term 

00:03:20.089 --> 00:03:21.249
 goal 

00:03:21.249 --> 00:03:25.169
 yes that is that the plans are very difficult if we name that western union 

00:03:25.169 --> 00:03:27.990
 I understand you will come again to watch those images 

00:03:27.990 --> 00:03:31.770
 if we are to defense then they have the keeper together, especially women 

00:03:31.770 --> 00:03:32.849
 there moments 

00:03:32.849 --> 00:03:36.749
 then we had that we speak maybe very close in spending but it 

00:03:36.749 --> 00:03:39.979
 but also this year again positive results with good results with 

00:03:39.979 --> 00:03:41.139
 european soccer 

00:03:41.139 --> 00:03:44.289
 maybe one has a transfer nice boys the thieves were not very big 

00:03:44.289 --> 00:03:45.469
 we see go 

00:03:45.469 --> 00:03:49.440
 then it can just happen that you only go close to the nolan 

00:03:49.440 --> 00:03:52.709
 yes that martin van yellow explained more and falls the biggest win 

00:03:52.709 --> 00:03:55.780
 nevertheless not in action with players selling on what you now no complicated 

00:03:55.780 --> 00:03:59.149
 financing arrangements for those players need more 

00:03:59.149 --> 00:04:02.169
 yes because without worth nothing is on the tour 

00:04:02.169 --> 00:04:05.939
 then this happens then you book profit and is also a logical question if that money 

00:04:05.939 --> 00:04:07.459
 yet investor for example 

00:04:07.459 --> 00:04:09.869
 the same van was going to play again later 

00:04:09.869 --> 00:04:13.529
 nea the fact that I just indicated that our negative equity is increasing 

00:04:13.529 --> 00:04:16.689
 to improve indicates that there is still not quite right there so that 

00:04:16.689 --> 00:04:19.819
 means in the game rules that we agree with us then we would agreed 

00:04:20.739 --> 00:04:22.770
 that is possible if there is a transfer now 

00:04:22.770 --> 00:04:26.559
 and money comes in and therefore incoming transfer to a modest part 

00:04:26.559 --> 00:04:31.110
 6 can be used for potential investment in playing 

00:04:31.110 --> 00:04:34.740
 there is a fixed percentage of just a little pepper off the situation 

00:04:34.740 --> 00:04:38.030
 Depends on the situation but modest and that always indicates that 

00:04:38.030 --> 00:04:41.980
 a lot is but I mean 5 percent more or less in it that the striker said that 

00:04:41.979 --> 00:04:45.490
 run excellent our attackers can feed you also reserve money 

00:04:45.490 --> 00:04:46.969
 for the new stadium 

00:04:46.969 --> 00:04:51.259
 And yes we do have more people in a new stadium than more in a new one 

00:04:51.259 --> 00:04:54.999
 training accommodation because they share stadium members like a real barges 

00:04:54.999 --> 00:04:57.389
 a transfer gate this case and it further 

00:04:57.389 --> 00:05:00.249
 reducing the debts arising from the three main elements but then 

00:05:00.249 --> 00:05:02.139
 a different order of first debts 

00:05:02.139 --> 00:05:04.939
 that is very sporty yet the training accommodation is right 

00:05:04.939 --> 00:05:07.780
 Your training accommodation will soon look at Vitesse where they find something 

00:05:07.780 --> 00:05:09.569
 are putting down beautiful things 

00:05:09.569 --> 00:05:13.539
 among others we have been there west and iraq martin van yellow in recent years 

00:05:14.389 --> 00:05:16.169
 the other people who help us with this 

00:05:16.169 --> 00:05:20.600
 various the result has been gathering in the Netherlands and abroad for years 

00:05:20.599 --> 00:05:22.819
 good elements within our capabilities 

00:05:22.819 --> 00:05:25.949
 and then they hope we will soon make our choices with yet 

00:05:25.949 --> 00:05:29.680
 two questions about the operational results apart from the orphanage is possible 

00:05:29.679 --> 00:05:30.639
 the coming years 

00:05:30.639 --> 00:05:34.620
 becomes much better if the presenter can be lucille to your turnover 

00:05:34.620 --> 00:05:36.409
 generate more profit with each other 

00:05:36.409 --> 00:05:40.649
 aalsmeer year policy plan it also made a modest profit but then run 

00:05:40.649 --> 00:05:45.179
 very heavily distracted against the limits of the stadium at Wemmel stopped at the 

00:05:45.179 --> 00:05:47.050
 units so nothing can be added to that 

00:05:47.050 --> 00:05:49.849
 almost all business seats have been sold out 

00:05:49.849 --> 00:05:53.009
 the merchandising there is now another plus 

00:05:53.559 --> 00:05:57.279
 sponsorship it is a very difficult world famous so the number 

00:05:57.279 --> 00:06:00.539
 millions that are added is very modest real beaters 

00:06:00.539 --> 00:06:03.900
 can you be honesty only then we make one the stadium 

00:06:04.400 --> 00:06:06.589
 there are also an option 

00:06:06.589 --> 00:06:10.349
 no, I don't think so if you see who's tailor-made for the bid 

00:06:10.349 --> 00:06:13.860
 and I have also expressed it where it was given to staff and management 

00:06:14.389 --> 00:06:18.380
 that the dialogue with the whole team killed very little and whining that one said 

00:06:18.379 --> 00:06:21.619
 normal boldness and 

00:06:21.619 --> 00:06:25.459
 have shown you can do that with even less than doing this job 

00:06:26.050 --> 00:06:27.129
 and last but not least 

00:06:27.129 --> 00:06:30.859
 how is this for you personally because you came when there was a big debt 

00:06:31.469 --> 00:06:35.669
 you learn a lot about you in the media, also from support this year 

00:06:35.669 --> 00:06:39.429
 a very important moment and a sense of justice for yourself no 

00:06:39.429 --> 00:06:41.069
 not to be known at all 

00:06:41.069 --> 00:06:44.719
 the guessing but coincidental to the martin painter because our feeling is 

00:06:44.719 --> 00:06:46.320
 that we became like each other 

00:06:46.320 --> 00:06:49.990
 sportsmen who supports the rd friends of feyenoord the test a lot this morning 

00:06:49.990 --> 00:06:51.919
 countries together, he is a management team 

00:06:51.919 --> 00:06:55.560
 at its first team to recruit the dordtse this technically established 

00:06:55.560 --> 00:06:58.699
 that you also do together the fin typical feyenoord tasks satisfying 

00:06:58.699 --> 00:06:59.520
 that other stuff
