00:00:13.570 --> 00:00:13.580 
so what it is basically this one is a

00:00:13.580 --> 00:00:16.580 
so what it is basically this one is a
high<00:00:14.580> five<00:00:15.000> PC<00:00:15.509> and<00:00:15.719> at<00:00:15.839> the<00:00:15.960> moment<00:00:16.109> is<00:00:16.379> the

00:00:16.580 --> 00:00:16.590 
high five PC and at the moment is the

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:19.310 
high five PC and at the moment is the
lightest<00:00:17.190> I<00:00:17.369> 5<00:00:17.820> PC<00:00:18.300> in<00:00:18.539> the<00:00:18.690> market

00:00:19.310 --> 00:00:19.320 
lightest I 5 PC in the market

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:23.599 
lightest I 5 PC in the market
it's<00:00:19.650> just<00:00:20.090> 800<00:00:21.090> I<00:00:21.270> think<00:00:21.750> 60<00:00:22.199> gram<00:00:22.500> so<00:00:23.160> under

00:00:23.599 --> 00:00:23.609 
it's just 800 I think 60 gram so under

00:00:23.609 --> 00:00:27.200 
it's just 800 I think 60 gram so under
one<00:00:23.760> kilogram<00:00:24.090> it's<00:00:24.990> an<00:00:25.199> 11<00:00:25.619> inch<00:00:25.830> and<00:00:26.189> it<00:00:27.180> has

00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:27.210 
one kilogram it's an 11 inch and it has

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:29.929 
one kilogram it's an 11 inch and it has
you<00:00:27.750> know<00:00:28.130> normally<00:00:29.130> you<00:00:29.250> have<00:00:29.400> the<00:00:29.550> media

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:35.190 
this kind of device but they use a arm

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:38.330 
this kind of device but they use a arm
CPU<00:00:35.550> for<00:00:36.420> this<00:00:36.570> one<00:00:36.780> is<00:00:36.899> a<00:00:36.930> real<00:00:37.230> powerful<00:00:37.950> PC

00:00:38.330 --> 00:00:38.340 
CPU for this one is a real powerful PC

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:41.930 
CPU for this one is a real powerful PC
with<00:00:38.550> a<00:00:38.579> with<00:00:39.210> a<00:00:39.239> high<00:00:40.079> 5<00:00:40.379> CPU<00:00:40.890> and<00:00:41.100> you<00:00:41.550> can<00:00:41.760> see

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:41.940 
with a with a high 5 CPU and you can see

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:44.270 
with a with a high 5 CPU and you can see
it's<00:00:42.059> very<00:00:42.379> thin<00:00:43.379> yeah

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:44.280 
it's very thin yeah

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:47.690 
it's very thin yeah
my<00:00:44.640> thumb<00:00:44.879> is<00:00:45.030> not<00:00:45.210> that<00:00:45.420> big<00:00:45.660> it's<00:00:46.350> just<00:00:46.920> a<00:00:47.399> 12

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:47.700 
my thumb is not that big it's just a 12

millimeter twelve point six millimeter
and<00:00:50.300> 860<00:00:51.300> gram<00:00:51.510> light<00:00:51.800> so<00:00:53.719> the<00:00:54.719> display<00:00:55.199> is

00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:55.440 
and 860 gram light so the display is

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:57.410 
and 860 gram light so the display is
also<00:00:55.800> very<00:00:55.980> special<00:00:56.160> it's<00:00:56.520> a<00:00:56.640> 400<00:00:57.270> nits

00:00:57.410 --> 00:00:57.420 
also very special it's a 400 nits

00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:00.080 
also very special it's a 400 nits
display<00:00:57.840> so<00:00:58.199> you<00:00:58.469> can<00:00:59.129> even<00:00:59.430> use<00:00:59.699> it<00:00:59.730> better

00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:00.090 
display so you can even use it better

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:03.529 
display so you can even use it better
outside<00:01:00.829> this<00:01:01.829> is<00:01:02.010> a<00:01:02.039> touch<00:01:02.340> interface<00:01:02.850> so<00:01:03.180> all

00:01:03.529 --> 00:01:03.539 
outside this is a touch interface so all

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:06.050 
outside this is a touch interface so all
the<00:01:03.780> icons<00:01:04.140> is<00:01:04.320> are<00:01:04.680> big<00:01:05.040> so<00:01:05.640> I<00:01:05.670> can<00:01:05.729> use

00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:06.060 
the icons is are big so I can use

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:10.850 
the icons is are big so I can use
YouTube<00:01:06.299> here<00:01:06.930> and<00:01:07.740> things<00:01:07.979> like<00:01:09.320> Twitter<00:01:10.320> and

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:10.860 
YouTube here and things like Twitter and

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:12.380 
YouTube here and things like Twitter and
so<00:01:11.130> on<00:01:11.159> and<00:01:11.460> so<00:01:11.610> it's<00:01:11.729> a<00:01:11.820> little<00:01:11.970> bit<00:01:12.119> touch

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:12.390 
so on and so it's a little bit touch

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:17.060 
so on and so it's a little bit touch
optimized<00:01:13.820> so<00:01:14.820> very<00:01:15.090> light<00:01:15.360> very<00:01:16.070> powerful

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:17.070 
optimized so very light very powerful

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:21.179 
optimized so very light very powerful
but<00:01:17.930> together<00:01:18.930> with<00:01:19.409> the<00:01:19.500> docking<00:01:19.740> station

00:01:21.179 --> 00:01:21.189 
but together with the docking station

00:01:21.189 --> 00:01:23.279 
but together with the docking station
it's<00:01:21.460> like<00:01:21.670> a<00:01:21.700> normal<00:01:22.149> PC<00:01:22.509> so<00:01:22.749> you<00:01:22.810> have<00:01:23.140> your

00:01:23.279 --> 00:01:23.289 
it's like a normal PC so you have your

00:01:23.289 --> 00:01:25.249 
it's like a normal PC so you have your
Bluetooth<00:01:23.710> people<00:01:24.130> here

00:01:25.249 --> 00:01:25.259 
Bluetooth people here

00:01:25.259 --> 00:01:28.260 
Bluetooth people here
docking<00:01:26.259> station<00:01:26.829> maybe<00:01:27.310> you<00:01:27.520> can<00:01:27.700> plug<00:01:27.939> in<00:01:28.119> a

00:01:28.260 --> 00:01:28.270 
docking station maybe you can plug in a

00:01:28.270 --> 00:01:31.230 
docking station maybe you can plug in a
bigger<00:01:28.539> monitor<00:01:28.929> as<00:01:29.439> well<00:01:29.469> we<00:01:30.369> have<00:01:30.460> up<00:01:31.179> to

00:01:31.230 --> 00:01:31.240 
bigger monitor as well we have up to

00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:34.499 
bigger monitor as well we have up to
seven<00:01:31.780> hours<00:01:31.899> battery<00:01:32.679> life<00:01:33.039> or<00:01:33.490> five<00:01:34.149> hours

00:01:34.499 --> 00:01:34.509 
seven hours battery life or five hours

00:01:34.509 --> 00:01:38.599 
seven hours battery life or five hours
of<00:01:34.659> playing<00:01:34.990> a<00:01:35.140> video<00:01:36.780> the<00:01:37.780> battery<00:01:38.109> is<00:01:38.170> also

00:01:38.599 --> 00:01:38.609 
of playing a video the battery is also

00:01:38.609 --> 00:01:43.499 
of playing a video the battery is also
1500<00:01:39.899> charging<00:01:40.899> then<00:01:41.259> still<00:01:41.619> it<00:01:41.799> has<00:01:41.979> 80<00:01:42.729> 70<00:01:43.390> to

00:01:43.499 --> 00:01:43.509 
1500 charging then still it has 80 70 to

00:01:43.509 --> 00:01:46.520 
1500 charging then still it has 80 70 to
80<00:01:43.659> percent<00:01:43.899> of<00:01:44.200> its<00:01:44.380> original<00:01:44.530> capacity<00:01:45.240> and

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:46.530 
80 percent of its original capacity and

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:48.870 
80 percent of its original capacity and
now<00:01:47.530> let's<00:01:47.740> have<00:01:47.859> a<00:01:47.920> quick<00:01:48.399> look<00:01:48.429> at<00:01:48.759> the

00:01:48.870 --> 00:01:48.880 
now let's have a quick look at the

00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:50.929 
now let's have a quick look at the
connectors

00:01:50.929 --> 00:01:50.939 
connectors

00:01:50.939 --> 00:01:55.719 
connectors
so<00:01:51.479> years<00:01:51.780> for<00:01:52.020> the<00:01:52.140> docking<00:01:52.469> station<00:01:54.259> power

00:01:55.719 --> 00:01:55.729 
so years for the docking station power

00:01:55.729 --> 00:01:57.819 
so years for the docking station power
mini-hdmi

00:01:57.819 --> 00:01:57.829 
mini-hdmi

00:01:57.829 --> 00:02:00.529 
mini-hdmi
that<00:01:58.829> must<00:01:59.069> be<00:01:59.159> some<00:01:59.429> kind<00:01:59.640> of<00:01:59.819> AA<00:02:00.000> that's<00:02:00.329> for

00:02:00.529 --> 00:02:00.539 
that must be some kind of AA that's for

00:02:00.539 --> 00:02:08.499 
that must be some kind of AA that's for
the<00:02:00.689> brightness<00:02:02.689> headphones<00:02:03.689> a<00:02:04.079> USB<00:02:05.479> and<00:02:07.220> I

00:02:08.499 --> 00:02:08.509 
the brightness headphones a USB and I

00:02:08.509 --> 00:02:11.240 
the brightness headphones a USB and I
think<00:02:09.509> that's<00:02:09.660> also<00:02:09.869> some<00:02:10.229> micro<00:02:10.619> SD<00:02:10.950> s<00:02:11.009> what

00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:11.250 
think that's also some micro SD s what

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:14.420 
think that's also some micro SD s what
we<00:02:11.430> have

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:14.430 

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:17.289 

and<00:02:14.700> that's<00:02:15.090> now<00:02:15.420> a<00:02:15.450> rotation<00:02:16.379> log<00:02:16.590> that's<00:02:16.799> not

00:02:17.289 --> 00:02:17.299 
and that's now a rotation log that's not

00:02:17.299 --> 00:02:19.460 
and that's now a rotation log that's not
rotating<00:02:18.299> anymore<00:02:18.689> that's<00:02:18.959> for<00:02:19.170> the<00:02:19.260> power

00:02:19.460 --> 00:02:19.470 
rotating anymore that's for the power

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:24.050 
rotating anymore that's for the power
one<00:02:20.400> more<00:02:20.579> thing<00:02:20.819> to<00:02:21.810> put<00:02:22.140> it<00:02:22.260> to<00:02:22.849> officer<00:02:23.849> this

00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:24.060 
one more thing to put it to officer this

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:27.350 
one more thing to put it to officer this
is<00:02:24.120> Rama<00:02:24.590> put<00:02:25.590> into<00:02:25.890> the<00:02:26.069> stream<00:02:26.670> mode<00:02:26.879> I<00:02:27.120> just

00:02:27.350 --> 00:02:27.360 
is Rama put into the stream mode I just

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:29.860 
is Rama put into the stream mode I just
pressed<00:02:27.930> here

00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:29.870 
pressed here

00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:32.259 
pressed here
now<00:02:30.410> it's<00:02:30.620> sleeping<00:02:31.160> but<00:02:31.580> saving<00:02:31.849> all<00:02:32.150> the
