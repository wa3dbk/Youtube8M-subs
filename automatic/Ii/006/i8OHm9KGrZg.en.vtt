 Tuesday will have the results of wells 

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:43.199
 germany 31 and well let's see how 

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:44.879
 it was wells germany 28 in miami 

00:00:43.199 --> 00:00:46.769
 you are lehman and again open with the 

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:48.540
 title of heavyweights 

00:00:46.769 --> 00:00:51.090
 we continue against daniel bryan and the 

00:00:48.540 --> 00:00:53.219
 they shit again if the previous ur is 

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:55.739
 Germany was a rubbish this is the 

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:57.510
 Triple who came up with the stupid 

00:00:55.739 --> 00:00:59.789
 idea of having an 'open air' by the 

00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:02.730
 title of the heavyweights and that they finish 

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:04.710
 18 damn seconds once again we 

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:07.020
 we are left without seeing we continue against brian 

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:09.869
 per second word is consecutive germany 

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:11.670
 it seemed that welles lehman already 28 was going to 

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:13.679
 the shit with this terrible start 

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:16.350
 we follow simply with the road that 

00:01:13.679 --> 00:01:18.659
 beat bryant and this shows the fall 

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:20.759
 of this important championship the 

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:23.340
 next is the fight between randy orton 

00:01:20.759 --> 00:01:25.380
 and cane a very close fight was good 

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:27.570
 but not spectacular game 

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:30.170
 to victory with a second slam clash 

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:32.549
 from the second rope the red monster 

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:34.380
 I needed that victory after losing the 

00:01:32.549 --> 00:01:36.930
 fief with sheena and orton not the 

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:38.390
 I needed so much later we have a 

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:42.090
 fight for the intercontinental title 

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:44.009
 between the champion cody ross and big show and 

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:45.840
 it was speak show finally has its triumph 

00:01:44.009 --> 00:01:48.000
 alone in ures lehman and I 

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:49.530
 I thought the biggest athlete would win 

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:51.929
 of the planet by the focus of the 

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:54.390
 Road rivalry has a quality 

00:01:51.929 --> 00:01:56.460
 excellent luchística but it is difficult that 

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:58.649
 someone of your size can look like a 

00:01:56.460 --> 00:02:01.049
 giant big show takes the victory 

00:01:58.649 --> 00:02:03.349
 with his punch and with the shock of 

00:02:01.049 --> 00:02:05.970
 styles the fight is not very spectacular 

00:02:03.349 --> 00:02:08.459
 the next is the fight of the divas 

00:02:05.970 --> 00:02:10.979
 Maria, I do not know if you can qualify as 

00:02:08.459 --> 00:02:13.140
 fight what he did together with Kelly 

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:15.660
 Kelly facing this receives 

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:18.120
 phoenix the fight they take her kelly 

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:20.459
 kelly and Maria and to rent the fight the 

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:22.620
 pin they do it to beth phoenix the 

00:02:20.459 --> 00:02:25.019
 next is the fight between undertaker and 

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:27.599
 triple h in a hell in a cell with shawn 

00:02:25.019 --> 00:02:30.510
 michaels as referee the fight is very 

00:02:27.599 --> 00:02:32.190
 good but I expected a little more is 

00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:35.160
 very similar to west 

00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:37.500
 to 27 only that now they were inside the 

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:40.170
 cell I like more this than the one 

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:43.410
 wells germany 28 as they dominate the two 

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:45.480
 and in the 27 only triple hy 

00:02:43.410 --> 00:02:47.220
 undertaker takes his third victory 

00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:50.370
 ante triple h you're not lehman anymore 

00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:52.290
 getting his 20 to 0 and at the end there is a 

00:02:50.370 --> 00:02:54.450
 very emotional moment when man 

00:02:52.290 --> 00:02:56.550
 dead triple hy shawn michaels 

00:02:54.450 --> 00:02:59.130
 embrace on the ramp this must have been the 

00:02:56.550 --> 00:03:01.950
 last taker fight was not like that much 

00:02:59.130 --> 00:03:04.590
 in res lehman already 29 and 30 and also 

00:03:01.950 --> 00:03:07.290
 will fight in the 31st but that we will see in 

00:03:04.590 --> 00:03:09.300
 other videos after we had the fight 

00:03:07.290 --> 00:03:11.940
 between the team of john laurinaitis and 

00:03:09.300 --> 00:03:14.340
 tedium and because the end is my who 

00:03:11.940 --> 00:03:16.230
 ends with saray der and towers becomes 

00:03:14.340 --> 00:03:18.420
 Gil was not nothing special but 

00:03:16.230 --> 00:03:20.550
 wanna fill fight gave what he had 

00:03:18.420 --> 00:03:23.250
 to give and lorin artist appropriated raw 

00:03:20.550 --> 00:03:26.580
 and smackdown the next fight is for the 

00:03:23.250 --> 00:03:29.310
 title of the wwf in 13 m anticrisis 

00:03:26.580 --> 00:03:32.100
 he dedicated really hoped he yericó was 

00:03:29.310 --> 00:03:34.920
 take the victory was not like that gm bread him 

00:03:32.100 --> 00:03:36.959
 he gave up with the anaconda vice was 

00:03:34.920 --> 00:03:38.670
 a struggle totally different from 

00:03:36.959 --> 00:03:41.610
 others that did not prevail 

00:03:38.670 --> 00:03:44.489
 very good fighting technique you see the quality 

00:03:41.610 --> 00:03:46.980
 of jericó as much as of punk and therefore a 

00:03:44.489 --> 00:03:49.290
 failure that return of dedicated and by 

00:03:46.980 --> 00:03:51.810
 last the main event / of rock and jones and 

00:03:49.290 --> 00:03:54.390
 na highlight the flower performances 

00:03:51.810 --> 00:03:56.400
 and he said he did not expect that if he did not lose 

00:03:54.390 --> 00:03:58.650
 It was the perfect time to do 

00:03:56.400 --> 00:04:01.050
 choose since this year was very hard for 

00:03:58.650 --> 00:04:01.620
 he fighting against came droids nobody 

00:04:01.050 --> 00:04:04.410
 others 

00:04:01.620 --> 00:04:07.050
 accumulating many defeats at the beginning 

00:04:04.410 --> 00:04:09.180
 is a replica of webs slogan or 18 is 

00:04:07.050 --> 00:04:11.130
 they are looking at the audience you see 

00:04:09.180 --> 00:04:13.920
 overthrew a little out of that at 

00:04:11.130 --> 00:04:15.840
 principle was already tired first if 

00:04:13.920 --> 00:04:18.479
 I do not carry the weight of the rock fight 

00:04:15.840 --> 00:04:20.400
 was the same as in 2000 at the end of 

00:04:18.479 --> 00:04:23.070
 rock so surprised na with a rice button 

00:04:20.400 --> 00:04:25.350
 when without imitating the typhoon jungle was 

00:04:23.070 --> 00:04:28.139
 a good fight is not by any means 

00:04:25.350 --> 00:04:30.750
 five star but very good as well 

00:04:28.139 --> 00:04:32.580
 that he has a lot of finishers and 

00:04:30.750 --> 00:04:34.100
 good friends here came the video 

00:04:32.580 --> 00:04:36.330
 today I hope you liked it 

00:04:34.100 --> 00:04:38.550
 leave me in the comments that 

00:04:36.330 --> 00:04:40.729
 the event seemed a greeting and even the 

00:04:38.550 --> 00:04:40.729
 next
