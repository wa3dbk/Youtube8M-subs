 presentation where we are going to teach a 

00:00:08.299 --> 00:00:11.450
 new product just 

00:00:09.440 --> 00:00:14.750

00:00:14.750 --> 00:00:20.780
 Built-in and bluetooth® technology for 

00:00:17.449 --> 00:00:24.800
 the new ipad ipad model 

00:00:20.780 --> 00:00:27.100
 good among all the products that 

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:31.580
 we have had and marketed for ipad 

00:00:27.100 --> 00:00:34.400
 of course this is the best 

00:00:31.580 --> 00:00:36.470
 with which we have come across 

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:39.890
 no longer just for its functionality 

00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:42.730
 but also for its quality the product 

00:00:39.890 --> 00:00:46.880
 of the highest quality a design 

00:00:42.730 --> 00:00:50.090
 very exclusive slim design 

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:52.130
 good light long battery life 

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:55.340
 with a product a little bit that has it 

00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:57.400
 everything with the presentation packaging what 

00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:59.650
 we see products 

00:00:57.400 --> 00:01:02.350
 until the packaging is very 

00:00:59.650 --> 00:01:05.260
 cool this product what will we 

00:01:02.350 --> 00:01:07.380
 serve is to let's say that our 

00:01:05.260 --> 00:01:10.900
 ipad let's turn a little bit into a 

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:14.010
 laptop well let's go to 

00:01:10.900 --> 00:01:14.010
 see the product itself 

00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:20.439
 as I said the good connection 

00:01:18.610 --> 00:01:22.380
 has the virtue technology for which 

00:01:20.439 --> 00:01:24.810
 you do not need any kind of cable to 

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:27.750
 to connect it 

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:31.940
 wirelessly and well then we 

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:34.720
 we found in the product with one side 

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:37.340
 has a small instruction manual 

00:01:34.720 --> 00:01:40.640
 very basic because it really does not have 

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:43.640
 a lot that much to tell us simply 

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:47.750
 with the connection mode and there is already a 

00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:51.560
 small usb charging cable for when 

00:01:47.750 --> 00:01:53.720
 we run out of keyboard battery 

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:56.180
 can connect to any USB source 

00:01:53.720 --> 00:02:00.110
 and be able to recharge it good is the battery 

00:01:56.180 --> 00:02:01.930
 so I told you that it is very very 

00:02:00.110 --> 00:02:04.240
 big 

00:02:01.930 --> 00:02:06.130
 depends a little on the use but we're going 

00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:10.679
 been even up to a month and a half without 

00:02:06.130 --> 00:02:10.679
 get to need battery charge 

00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:19.120
 you see it has an aluminum finish and 

00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:21.910
 It's a design because you 'll see it to slim 

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:26.010
 respecting the connections 

00:02:21.910 --> 00:02:28.260
 that has the ipad the back camera he 

00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:31.430
 the rear speaker the connections of 

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:31.430
 good volume 

00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:35.549
 to see the product 

00:02:33.819 --> 00:02:38.730
 I have not commented that the keyboard 

00:02:35.549 --> 00:02:40.470
 It is effectively a keyboard 

00:02:38.730 --> 00:02:43.049
 updated let's say to the Spanish language 

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:45.569
 today our ñ with our match faith 

00:02:43.049 --> 00:02:48.030
 well, a keyboard like the one 

00:02:45.569 --> 00:02:50.280
 we use 

00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:52.830
 good the connection method with the ipad 

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:55.290
 it's a super easy connection method 

00:02:52.830 --> 00:02:57.870
 only we'll have to 

00:02:55.290 --> 00:03:01.140
 do it the first time is to synchronize 

00:02:57.870 --> 00:03:04.290
 the two devices and we're going to go into 

00:03:01.140 --> 00:03:06.989
 the adjustments part we will activate the 

00:03:04.290 --> 00:03:09.390
 bluetooth and on the other hand we have to 

00:03:06.989 --> 00:03:12.540
 activate the bluetooth of our case 

00:03:09.390 --> 00:03:15.330
 for this we have to press the letter 

00:03:12.540 --> 00:03:18.480
 function and the letter c 

00:03:15.330 --> 00:03:21.180
 we will be able to blink the led 

00:03:18.480 --> 00:03:23.310
 bluetooth and directly here in the 

00:03:21.180 --> 00:03:25.890
 ipad screen I got the 

00:03:23.310 --> 00:03:29.880
 device that I found the 

00:03:25.890 --> 00:03:33.700
 we sign and it is already giving me that it has 

00:03:29.880 --> 00:03:35.980
 connected is valid to be able to check 

00:03:33.700 --> 00:03:37.920
 if it is perfectly connected we 

00:03:35.980 --> 00:03:40.980
 let's open the 

00:03:37.920 --> 00:03:43.860
 the safari for example and let's get 

00:03:40.980 --> 00:03:46.020
 to write like we already see here that a 

00:03:43.860 --> 00:03:46.980
 as I go by pressing the keyboard I 

00:03:46.020 --> 00:03:49.990
 it's showing up we have it 

00:03:46.980 --> 00:03:54.700
 perfectly matched vale 

00:03:49.990 --> 00:03:57.100
 to connect to place the ipad to the 

00:03:54.700 --> 00:03:58.720
 back cover where it's connected is 

00:03:57.100 --> 00:04:01.480
 perfectly designed for our and 

00:03:58.720 --> 00:04:03.580
 father as we have commented before and good 

00:04:01.480 --> 00:04:07.570
 it also has the sleep function that is 

00:04:03.580 --> 00:04:09.370
 that when I close the device the 

00:04:07.570 --> 00:04:11.530
 ipad is going to stay in sleep function 

00:04:09.370 --> 00:04:14.080
 so that I do not consume any kind of 

00:04:11.530 --> 00:04:16.959
 battery all free connections for 

00:04:14.080 --> 00:04:20.280
 its use as we have commented camera button 

00:04:16.959 --> 00:04:23.470
 from off to even the manzanita 

00:04:20.280 --> 00:04:27.130
 charging lightning connector and good since 

00:04:23.470 --> 00:04:29.530
 you see the super very elegant design 

00:04:27.130 --> 00:04:32.020
 It also has the versatility of 

00:04:29.530 --> 00:04:34.480
 be able to be placed as a way of say 

00:04:32.020 --> 00:04:36.700
 a laptop that I can place it on 

00:04:34.480 --> 00:04:39.250
 different positions be it a little the 

00:04:36.700 --> 00:04:41.050
 use that I will give you or the angle of 

00:04:39.250 --> 00:04:43.540
 vision that interests me in each 

00:04:41.050 --> 00:04:45.390
 moment is worth once you already 

00:04:43.540 --> 00:04:49.030
 synchronized you see that directly 

00:04:45.390 --> 00:04:51.520
 when I open it, I can put on 

00:04:49.030 --> 00:04:53.470
 write in the stories and well then 

00:04:51.520 --> 00:04:55.300
 besides what are the keys let's say 

00:04:53.470 --> 00:04:57.750
 of writing because it will also give me 

00:04:55.300 --> 00:04:57.750
 keys 

00:04:57.980 --> 00:05:04.360
 we classify multimedia to go up download 

00:05:00.530 --> 00:05:06.890
 volume the brightness rise lower the volume 

00:05:04.360 --> 00:05:07.730
 even turn off the screen if 

00:05:06.890 --> 00:05:10.100
 we would like 

00:05:07.730 --> 00:05:13.430
 if we are visualizing or listening 

00:05:10.100 --> 00:05:15.380
 music pass songs videos good is 

00:05:13.430 --> 00:05:17.960
