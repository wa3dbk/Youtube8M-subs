00:00:03.020 --> 00:00:07.080
 hello welcome to 1000 

00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:08.580
 better today, let's have a look 

00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:11.340
 actually right at first sight 

00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:15.360
 mundane on which he heizdecken 

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:18.150
 got the ebit at insider info 

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:19.140
 the video has a blanket 

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:20.550
 past always medium 

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:22.140
 mentally treated and 

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:24.990
 just in the cheapest electric blankets 

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:27.000
 buys his guardian but in truth 

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:30.330
 I'm not very good at the topic 

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:33.390
 have had cared to two hairs 

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:35.280
 aha experience number one was politics 

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:37.260
 several of my beautiful blankets 

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:40.469
 simply mount the corner of the moped 

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:42.149
 Thrown stream stuck out of these too 

00:00:40.469 --> 00:00:47.280
 a wonderfully steaming lump 

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:50.969
 plastic fused experience only in 2000 

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:52.800
 The crib in Brünn only has four degrees 

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:55.559
 outside temperature have had one 

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:58.949
 wonderful view of the superdome 

00:00:55.559 --> 00:01:01.289
 had 400 ¬ cost the blankets 

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:03.960
 Of course, I had it upstairs, and I did 

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:05.339
 out of the box so out of the box 

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:07.740
 Dangers are measured at a temperature 

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:09.960
 the tires were only 60 anymore 

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:12.600
 grad probably pharma pit lanes 

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:15.890
 streamer will result was clear 

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:17.700
 after first the tires completely ruined 

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:19.500
 it is apparently already for the 

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:21.620
 do not even fire bad 

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:24.950
 the experience 

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:27.620
 to reach - crafted and there 

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:29.090
 is there a contact person 

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:31.580
 South Tyrol also active in the motogp 

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:34.460
 you know you are from there and have 

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:36.440
 Of course, then every kremann 

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:38.780
 Ever said its products that the 

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:40.270
 keb ware good enough for russian needs 

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:42.680
 of course, be good enough for me 

00:01:40.270 --> 00:01:44.840
 Of course, these problems does not have 

00:01:42.680 --> 00:01:46.520
 on the one hand the tire warmers on all 

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:48.710
 times his promises the 

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:50.630
 temperature actually bring the temperature 

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:52.130
 is on the display and of course already 

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:54.740
 the second important point i can do here 

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:56.990
 with my electric blanket of Cappek 

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:58.580
 more settings on the display temperature 

00:01:56.990 --> 00:02:00.290
 For example , he needs you 

00:01:58.580 --> 00:02:03.290
 the pirelli or the bridgestone 

00:02:00.290 --> 00:02:05.210
 set slicks 80 degrees and at the 

00:02:03.290 --> 00:02:06.140
 downloads links for example 90 degrees at 

00:02:05.210 --> 00:02:08.510
 this year even nowadays 

00:02:06.140 --> 00:02:09.980
 a science the slicks become 

00:02:08.510 --> 00:02:11.240
 always better to the manufacturers but 

00:02:09.980 --> 00:02:13.310
 always more delicate 

00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:15.800
 that is, had the precise parcours 

00:02:13.310 --> 00:02:18.050
 adjust and grab if you have to 

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:19.580
 Of course, partners also achieve precision 

00:02:18.050 --> 00:02:23.270
 but can also entertain 

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:25.370
 it is still a bit colder 

00:02:23.270 --> 00:02:27.290
 explains the colleague of kappel but what 

00:02:25.370 --> 00:02:30.410
 you also have to watch many cheap ones 

00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:32.750
 tire warmers have a temperature 

00:02:30.410 --> 00:02:34.130
 Sensor installed as simple as possible 

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:35.450
 whether the 80 degrees 

00:02:34.130 --> 00:02:37.400
 so most are asked 

00:02:35.450 --> 00:02:38.930
 be achieved or not then just that 

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:40.100
 switch on and off and there must 

00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:41.780
 Of course you have to be careful if you have the 

00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:44.270
 temperature sensors for example then 

00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:45.890
 just as under the fender trainers 

00:02:44.270 --> 00:02:47.720
 then, of course, will be inside here 

00:02:45.890 --> 00:02:49.340
 you reach the 80 degrees much faster 

00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:52.910
 power he already turns off the power and 

00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:54.350
 but here he is too cool even then 

00:02:52.910 --> 00:02:57.740
 you rip the tires back on when is 

00:02:54.350 --> 00:02:59.570
 a sensitive high tech new handicap 

00:02:57.740 --> 00:03:01.610
 It's not like that here 

00:02:59.570 --> 00:03:03.800
 temperature sensors are used 

00:03:01.610 --> 00:03:06.170
 but that diddy did the complete fabric 

00:03:03.800 --> 00:03:08.690
 Diddy regulation on the resistance of the 

00:03:06.170 --> 00:03:10.370
 complete fabric is made and 

00:03:08.690 --> 00:03:12.440
 accordingly , know about this 

00:03:10.370 --> 00:03:14.450
 an on off regulation but one 

00:03:12.440 --> 00:03:16.010
 stepless control depending on how high 

00:03:14.450 --> 00:03:18.440
 The resistance will flow naturally 

00:03:16.010 --> 00:03:20.300
 then less current through and so will the 

00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:24.370
 set temperature also over the 

00:03:20.300 --> 00:03:26.270
 entire circumference achieved precisely 

00:03:24.370 --> 00:03:27.980
 pleasant side effect is then too 

00:03:26.270 --> 00:03:29.510
 if you like the mature when you go 

00:03:27.980 --> 00:03:31.940
 forgets to stake out and that lies here 

00:03:29.510 --> 00:03:34.400
 that's how it is 

00:03:31.940 --> 00:03:36.590
 No security measures in the home 

00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:37.700
 more you will not overheat so easily 

00:03:36.590 --> 00:03:39.500
 like a conventional cheapest 

00:03:37.700 --> 00:03:41.300
 hoarfrost and then it happens 

00:03:39.500 --> 00:03:43.250
 not that awkward robot in the 

00:03:41.300 --> 00:03:45.410
 Of course the pit lane also important 

00:03:43.250 --> 00:03:46.820
 we have a very fine here 

00:03:45.410 --> 00:03:49.370
 supple fabric that is not 

00:03:46.820 --> 00:03:51.320
 single thick highlights blaze the 

00:03:49.370 --> 00:03:52.760
 happy to be broken down settlement but 

00:03:51.320 --> 00:03:55.580
 It is a very fine fabric here 

00:03:52.760 --> 00:03:57.250
 Well wrapped is incorporated into the 

00:03:55.580 --> 00:04:00.140
 in the heating blanket looks very high quality 

00:03:57.250 --> 00:04:01.880
 robust practical and there I am 

00:04:00.140 --> 00:04:03.920
 glad that now at the current 

00:04:01.880 --> 00:04:05.570
 If you look at this robust again 

00:04:03.920 --> 00:04:07.459
 but actually I do not want me 

00:04:05.570 --> 00:04:08.270
 display with it is that is yes 

00:04:07.459 --> 00:04:10.220
 really sturdy 

00:04:08.270 --> 00:04:13.370
 at the last series were on this 

00:04:10.220 --> 00:04:14.510
 noble high-tech displays on it if one 

00:04:13.370 --> 00:04:16.220
 something has gone wrong for the three of them 

00:04:14.510 --> 00:04:18.859
 Personally, I now find the regulation 

00:04:16.220 --> 00:04:21.140
 the solution ago with the rather cheap 

00:04:18.859 --> 00:04:23.960
 Acting the claims 

00:04:21.140 --> 00:04:25.970
 clearly how perfect i have now 

00:04:23.960 --> 00:04:28.490
 just set 60 degrees I think 

00:04:25.970 --> 00:04:31.430
 Optimal course , of course, last 

00:04:28.490 --> 00:04:32.540
 I drove there lunch break there 

00:04:31.430 --> 00:04:33.950
 I do not completely let the tires go 

00:04:32.540 --> 00:04:36.020
 can cool down to 60 degrees 

00:04:33.950 --> 00:04:37.820
 if I drive out then but 

00:04:36.020 --> 00:04:41.390
 three quarters of an hour before I push myself 

00:04:37.820 --> 00:04:42.979
 simply the temperature reduced to 80 degrees 

00:04:41.390 --> 00:04:44.479
 at precisely reached and then it goes 

00:04:42.979 --> 00:04:45.890
 Back there because that 's natural too 

00:04:44.479 --> 00:04:47.570
 really understand that after the 

00:04:45.890 --> 00:04:48.590
 Do not cool the load immediately 

00:04:47.570 --> 00:04:52.490
 but then you too 

00:04:48.590 --> 00:04:53.690
 I packed up nice and warm now been 

00:04:52.490 --> 00:04:56.000
 I have collected a few experiences 

00:04:53.690 --> 00:04:58.460
 say can recommend with a good conscience 

00:04:56.000 --> 00:05:00.320
 the parts are naturally expensive like that 

00:04:58.460 --> 00:05:02.510
 conventional image fabric tire warmer 

00:05:00.320 --> 00:05:04.370
 but you think that he is by no means 400er 

00:05:02.510 --> 00:05:07.870
 It has to be really expensive 

00:05:04.370 --> 00:05:07.870
 can recommend
