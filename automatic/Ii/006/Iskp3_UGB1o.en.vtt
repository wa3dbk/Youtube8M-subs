about this weapon is that it just does

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:56.600

distances<00:01:00.120> it's<00:01:00.690> not<00:01:00.899> going<00:01:00.989> to<00:01:01.079> be<00:01:01.170> as

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:01.350

00:01:03.229 --> 00:01:03.239 
accurate so I wouldn't recommend it for

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:05.990 
accurate so I wouldn't recommend it for
larger<00:01:03.780> Maps<00:01:03.989> but<00:01:04.260> if<00:01:04.379> you're<00:01:04.500> going<00:01:04.739> in<00:01:05.010> for

larger Maps but if you're going in for

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:07.160 
larger Maps but if you're going in for
close-quarter<00:01:06.540> where<00:01:06.659> they're<00:01:06.780> taking<00:01:06.960> a
