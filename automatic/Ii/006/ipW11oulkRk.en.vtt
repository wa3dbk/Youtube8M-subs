 on how to act in cases of drowning 

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:33.540
 we found a rather 

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:35.610
 by the lieutenant of the

 fire department of são paulo marcelo 

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:41.009
 lourusso to sbt in the middle of the interview o 

00:01:38.729 --> 00:01:43.920
 Lieutenant speaks about drowning 

00:01:41.009 --> 00:01:45.450
 with unconscious victim opens up quotes 

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:47.850
 you come across the unconscious person 

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:48.810
 in water you should check out the 

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:50.850
 Vital signs 

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:53.189
 you should start rcp resuscitation 

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:55.799
 cardiopulmonary triggering relief 

00:01:53.189 --> 00:01:57.689
 and prevent hypothermia 

00:01:55.799 --> 00:01:59.880
 excessive temperature decrease 

00:01:57.689 --> 00:02:02.549
 the body's normal procedures are 

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:04.560
 in this case closed more 

00:02:02.549 --> 00:02:06.270
 He claims to have no title and after 

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:07.619
 she is already out of the water has already been placed 

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:09.360
 at the appropriate location 

00:02:07.619 --> 00:02:11.459
 What is the procedure that goes like this? 

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:12.690
 we have several levels of 

00:02:11.459 --> 00:02:13.710
 drowning né 

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:16.530
 for example you take 

00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:19.230
 look at the water conscious person is then 

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:20.910
 she breathes has momentum is a situation 

00:02:19.230 --> 00:02:21.690
 People will prevent hypothermia from this. 

00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:23.670
 to occur 

00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:26.460
 now when you give it to the person 

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:28.620
 unconscious in the water you should take it out there 

00:02:26.460 --> 00:02:30.720
 right and take that person water right 

00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:33.840
 check for vital signs 

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:37.200
 in case she is unconscious you should 

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:39.720
 start rcp trigger the advanced help 

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:43.250
 Nené the fire station or with sambou 

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:46.770
 doctor and is already starting the maneuvers 

00:02:43.250 --> 00:02:49.170
 help airplanes and prevent hypothermia 

00:02:46.770 --> 00:02:50.940
 These are the procedures that are 

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:52.890
 performed in that cases to arrive at 

00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:53.640
 help arrived to speak 

00:02:52.890 --> 00:02:55.170
 about the subject 

00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:56.700
 We'll have a simulation here on the 

00:02:55.170 --> 00:02:57.480
 studio would have told you to walk a 

00:02:56.700 --> 00:02:58.950
 little aside 

00:02:57.480 --> 00:03:00.930
 We invited you here with our 

00:02:58.950 --> 00:03:03.060
 sbt professional here also had a 

00:03:00.930 --> 00:03:05.070
 another is a firefighter who will help us 

00:03:03.060 --> 00:03:06.870
 What is the correct procedure of course? 

00:03:05.070 --> 00:03:08.700
 which is just a simulation it will not 

00:03:06.870 --> 00:03:10.950
 put all the necessary force but the 

00:03:08.700 --> 00:03:12.540
 explain to people how to identify and 

00:03:10.950 --> 00:03:15.120
 see how that is any procedure 

00:03:12.540 --> 00:03:17.160
 that is the internet is in the case the fireman 

00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:20.640
 arrived he encountered a victim 

00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:23.580
 unconscious is he already withdrawn from the 

00:03:20.640 --> 00:03:26.520
 water he removed then he will check the 

00:03:23.580 --> 00:03:28.350
 vital signs he will see if the pulse and 

00:03:26.520 --> 00:03:30.780
 if the victim then breathes firefighters 

00:03:28.350 --> 00:03:32.820
 arrived will arrive will speak and you are 

00:03:30.780 --> 00:03:34.140
 well you can hear me the not 

00:03:32.820 --> 00:03:36.570
 responds because she is unconscious 

00:03:34.140 --> 00:03:37.890
 then it will perform an open maneuver 

00:03:36.570 --> 00:03:40.980
 airways 

00:03:37.890 --> 00:03:41.940
 It's okay, April airways, the victim is not 

00:03:40.980 --> 00:03:44.160
 breathe 

00:03:41.940 --> 00:03:45.750
 he will check if there is no wrist watch 

00:03:44.160 --> 00:03:46.890
 hearing and feeling that you are observing the law 

00:03:45.750 --> 00:03:48.390
 that the victim has no movement 

00:03:46.890 --> 00:03:50.370
 chest expansion 

00:03:48.390 --> 00:03:53.840
 then he will check pulse there is not there 

00:03:50.370 --> 00:03:55.800
 pulse there it will start there rcp 

00:03:53.840 --> 00:03:57.150
 first two 

00:03:55.800 --> 00:03:59.430
 rescue né 

00:03:57.150 --> 00:04:01.770
 he made it famous not to go back to his mouth 

00:03:59.430 --> 00:04:03.570
 we wear an island mask also in the 

00:04:01.770 --> 00:04:04.650
 vehicles where we do not contact 

00:04:03.570 --> 00:04:07.050
 word of mouth right? 

00:04:04.650 --> 00:04:10.010
 It goes beyond measuring there two fingers above 

00:04:07.050 --> 00:04:13.830
 of the stereo bone start 30 compressions 

00:04:10.010 --> 00:04:16.500
 30 compressions are performed for two 

00:04:13.830 --> 00:04:18.720
 ventilation in a two-minute cycle 

00:04:16.500 --> 00:04:20.730
 where he will again check if the 

00:04:18.720 --> 00:04:21.900
 pulses expelled came back and if the victim 

00:04:20.730 --> 00:04:24.000
 breathe 

00:04:21.900 --> 00:04:25.770
 while there is no pulse and the victim does not 

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:27.930
 breathe it proceeds in the hand 

00:04:25.770 --> 00:04:30.030
 until the arrival of the 

00:04:27.930 --> 00:04:31.379
 specialized at this time sometimes 

00:04:30.030 --> 00:04:33.569
 person who also gained a lot of water 

00:04:31.379 --> 00:04:35.849
 ends up regurgitating and left the 

00:04:33.569 --> 00:04:38.220
 procedure will lateralize the 

00:04:35.849 --> 00:04:39.930
 victim will put the victim of the 

00:04:38.220 --> 00:04:43.050
 What if she comes to vomit? 

00:04:39.930 --> 00:04:45.449
 liquid spiller it can be placed 

00:04:43.050 --> 00:04:47.129
 a position in which it does not Ford in 

00:04:45.449 --> 00:04:50.039
 own period liquid then it goes 

00:04:47.129 --> 00:04:53.310
 put the lateralized victim there 

00:04:50.039 --> 00:04:55.590
 the person can expel the liquid 

00:04:53.310 --> 00:04:58.770
 which she swallowed, thus avoiding an evil 

00:04:55.590 --> 00:05:00.300
 bigger is this type of maneuver done 

00:04:58.770 --> 00:05:02.639
 can be used in which other situations 

00:05:00.300 --> 00:05:04.530
 so here it is done in this case 

00:05:02.639 --> 00:05:06.930
 lateralization maneuver is for when the 

00:05:04.530 --> 00:05:10.500
 victim a myth or expect liquid now 

00:05:06.930 --> 00:05:12.210
 rcp it started for all kinds of 

00:05:10.500 --> 00:05:13.289
 cardiorespiratory arrest 

00:05:12.210 --> 00:05:15.000
 the victim went into a parade 

00:05:13.289 --> 00:05:17.729
 cardiorespiratory fitness being adult child 

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:19.440
 is placed on the rigid surface and 

00:05:17.729 --> 00:05:21.569
 be initiated there, the maneuvers of 

00:05:19.440 --> 00:05:23.069
 resuscitation mayor plus more 

00:05:21.569 --> 00:05:24.539
 thank you for your participation here 

00:05:23.069 --> 00:05:25.919
 also of a war that helps us to 

00:05:24.539 --> 00:05:27.780
 in this simulation and also in the casino 

00:05:25.919 --> 00:05:29.580
 our co-worker who helped us 

00:05:27.780 --> 00:05:31.530
 throughout this operation is always very 

00:05:29.580 --> 00:05:33.630
 important to be aware is always always 

00:05:31.530 --> 00:05:35.370
 It is essential for staff to be 

00:05:33.630 --> 00:05:36.960
 any detail and be when it is 

00:05:35.370 --> 00:05:39.060
 children do not let any 

00:05:36.960 --> 00:05:41.449
 carelessness can become a major 

00:05:39.060 --> 00:05:41.449
 tragedy
