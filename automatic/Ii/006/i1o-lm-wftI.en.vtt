about also we feel it'll bring a lot

00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:04.200 
about also we feel it'll bring a lot
more<00:02:02.710> reliability<00:02:03.130> to<00:02:03.429> our<00:02:03.490> equipment<00:02:03.940> a<00:02:04.030> lot

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:04.210 
more reliability to our equipment a lot

00:02:04.210 --> 00:02:07.050 
more reliability to our equipment a lot
better<00:02:04.360> use<00:02:04.630> of<00:02:04.659> our<00:02:05.289> shot<00:02:05.560> material<00:02:06.159> this

00:02:07.050 --> 00:02:07.060 
better use of our shot material this

00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:09.809 
better use of our shot material this
facility<00:02:07.600> here<00:02:07.840> we<00:02:08.110> spend<00:02:08.789> hundreds<00:02:09.789> of
