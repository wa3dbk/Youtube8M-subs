00:00:03.960 --> 00:00:21.370 

I<00:00:15.080> think<00:00:16.080> about<00:00:18.260> metronomic<00:00:19.260> time<00:00:19.769> and<00:00:20.210> how

00:00:21.370 --> 00:00:21.380 
I think about metronomic time and how

00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:27.010 
I think about metronomic time and how
certain<00:00:22.940> placement<00:00:23.940> of<00:00:24.200> grooves<00:00:25.699> dynamic

00:00:27.010 --> 00:00:27.020 
certain placement of grooves dynamic

00:00:27.020 --> 00:00:29.090 
certain placement of grooves dynamic
information<00:00:28.020> that<00:00:28.140> happens<00:00:28.470> in<00:00:28.590> a<00:00:28.680> drum<00:00:28.920> fill

00:00:29.090 --> 00:00:29.100 
information that happens in a drum fill

00:00:29.100 --> 00:00:30.920 
information that happens in a drum fill
that<00:00:29.310> kind<00:00:29.520> of<00:00:29.670> turns<00:00:29.970> the<00:00:30.210> page<00:00:30.420> on<00:00:30.630> the<00:00:30.720> beat

00:00:30.920 --> 00:00:30.930 
that kind of turns the page on the beat

00:00:30.930 --> 00:00:33.770 
that kind of turns the page on the beat
and<00:00:31.189> where<00:00:32.189> you<00:00:32.399> deliberately<00:00:33.059> place<00:00:33.449> those

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:33.780 
and where you deliberately place those

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:36.190 
and where you deliberately place those
things<00:00:34.109> can<00:00:35.010> make<00:00:35.550> the<00:00:35.699> difference<00:00:35.850> between

00:00:36.190 --> 00:00:36.200 
things can make the difference between

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:39.080 
things can make the difference between
the<00:00:37.200> thing<00:00:37.410> being<00:00:37.620> really<00:00:38.040> exciting<00:00:38.610> or<00:00:38.790> being

00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:39.090 
the thing being really exciting or being

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:42.139 
the thing being really exciting or being
laid<00:00:39.300> back<00:00:39.570> or<00:00:40.320> being<00:00:40.680> almost<00:00:41.100> like<00:00:41.430> you<00:00:41.970> don't

00:00:42.139 --> 00:00:42.149 
laid back or being almost like you don't

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:43.760 
laid back or being almost like you don't
even<00:00:42.270> notice<00:00:42.540> that<00:00:42.809> the<00:00:42.960> page<00:00:43.140> got<00:00:43.410> turned<00:00:43.620> in

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:43.770 
even notice that the page got turned in

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:51.380 
even notice that the page got turned in
just<00:00:48.920> based<00:00:49.920> on<00:00:50.160> the<00:00:50.250> mood<00:00:50.550> that's<00:00:50.969> happening

00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:51.390 
just based on the mood that's happening

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:53.720 
just based on the mood that's happening
on<00:00:51.480> stage<00:00:51.600> I<00:00:51.870> can<00:00:52.050> make<00:00:52.230> that<00:00:52.440> choice<00:00:52.770> and<00:00:53.219> then

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:53.730 
on stage I can make that choice and then

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:56.869 
on stage I can make that choice and then
other<00:00:53.880> times<00:00:54.320> it<00:00:55.320> might<00:00:56.280> require<00:00:56.610> that

00:00:56.869 --> 00:00:56.879 
other times it might require that

00:00:56.879 --> 00:00:59.780 
other times it might require that
there's<00:00:57.270> no<00:00:57.570> fills<00:00:58.160> you<00:00:59.160> know<00:00:59.280> that<00:00:59.460> means<00:00:59.640> so

00:00:59.780 --> 00:00:59.790 
there's no fills you know that means so

00:00:59.790 --> 00:01:02.500 
there's no fills you know that means so
you're<00:01:00.030> you're<00:01:00.600> moving<00:01:01.140> the<00:01:01.260> groove<00:01:01.469> along

00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:02.510 
you're you're moving the groove along

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:09.250 
you're you're moving the groove along
subliminally<00:01:03.510> emotionally<00:01:06.530> and<00:01:07.530> you<00:01:08.490> feel<00:01:08.970> it

00:01:09.250 --> 00:01:09.260 
subliminally emotionally and you feel it

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:11.810 
subliminally emotionally and you feel it
chase<00:01:10.260> but<00:01:10.500> then<00:01:10.650> maybe<00:01:10.890> nothing<00:01:11.460> in<00:01:11.580> the<00:01:11.670> up

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:11.820 
chase but then maybe nothing in the up

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:14.930 
chase but then maybe nothing in the up
and<00:01:12.150> the<00:01:12.270> overall<00:01:12.600> pattern<00:01:13.020> of<00:01:13.350> change<00:01:13.940> just

00:01:14.930 --> 00:01:14.940 
and the overall pattern of change just

00:01:14.940 --> 00:01:17.719 
and the overall pattern of change just
the<00:01:15.330> you<00:01:16.229> felt<00:01:16.590> a<00:01:16.710> transition<00:01:17.280> into<00:01:17.490> the<00:01:17.580> next

00:01:17.719 --> 00:01:17.729 
the you felt a transition into the next

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:19.399 
the you felt a transition into the next
section<00:01:18.000> without<00:01:18.240> me<00:01:18.600> actually<00:01:18.720> playing<00:01:19.290> a

00:01:19.399 --> 00:01:19.409 
section without me actually playing a

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:21.590 
section without me actually playing a
drum<00:01:19.590> fill<00:01:19.830> you<00:01:20.610> know<00:01:20.729> what<00:01:20.820> I<00:01:20.880> mean<00:01:21.030> so

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:21.600 
drum fill you know what I mean so

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:23.899 
drum fill you know what I mean so
I<00:01:21.630> think<00:01:22.619> I<00:01:22.710> got<00:01:22.890> into<00:01:23.189> that<00:01:23.220> from<00:01:23.610> making

00:01:23.899 --> 00:01:23.909 
I think I got into that from making

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:26.120 
I think I got into that from making
records<00:01:24.360> for<00:01:24.570> so<00:01:24.750> long<00:01:24.960> because<00:01:25.260> I<00:01:25.439> know<00:01:25.979> are<00:01:26.100> a

records for so long because I know are a

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:27.560 
records for so long because I know are a
few<00:01:26.340> producers<00:01:26.850> that<00:01:26.939> would<00:01:27.090> be<00:01:27.150> like<00:01:27.330> don't

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:27.570

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:43.990 
crashing every four bar sometimes I just
need<00:01:40.979> the<00:01:41.280> thing<00:01:41.549> to<00:01:41.930> tell<00:01:42.930> me<00:01:42.990> keep<00:01:43.259> moving

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:51.750 
grooves to almost like a meditation you

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:55.160 
grooves to almost like a meditation you
know<00:01:51.840> the<00:01:51.990> repetition<00:01:52.770> is<00:01:53.450> what<00:01:54.450> makes<00:01:54.840> it<00:01:55.020> get

00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:55.170 
know the repetition is what makes it get

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:56.740 
know the repetition is what makes it get
stronger<00:01:55.530> and<00:01:55.799> stronger<00:01:56.040> and<00:01:56.280> stronger

00:01:56.740 --> 00:01:56.750 
stronger and stronger and stronger

00:01:56.750 --> 00:01:58.600 
stronger and stronger and stronger
the<00:01:56.840> repetition<00:01:57.230> expected<00:01:57.920> the<00:01:58.340> small

00:01:58.600 --> 00:01:58.610 
the repetition expected the small

00:01:58.610 --> 00:02:00.130 
the repetition expected the small
snowball<00:01:59.210> that<00:01:59.240> she's<00:01:59.600> thrown<00:01:59.810> down<00:01:59.930> the

00:02:00.130 --> 00:02:00.140 
snowball that she's thrown down the

00:02:00.140 --> 00:02:01.540 
snowball that she's thrown down the
mountain<00:02:00.530> that<00:02:00.620> just<00:02:00.860> gets<00:02:01.040> bigger<00:02:01.220> and

00:02:01.540 --> 00:02:01.550 
mountain that just gets bigger and

00:02:01.550 --> 00:02:03.340 
mountain that just gets bigger and
bigger<00:02:01.790> and<00:02:02.120> bigger<00:02:02.480> until<00:02:02.540> it's<00:02:02.840> a<00:02:02.930> huge

00:02:03.340 --> 00:02:03.350 
bigger and bigger until it's a huge

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:05.020 
bigger and bigger until it's a huge
thing<00:02:03.650> when<00:02:03.800> it<00:02:03.890> gets<00:02:04.040> to<00:02:04.100> the<00:02:04.190> bottom<00:02:04.370> but<00:02:04.850> it

00:02:05.020 --> 00:02:05.030 
thing when it gets to the bottom but it

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:07.360 
thing when it gets to the bottom but it
started<00:02:05.420> off<00:02:05.600> as<00:02:05.750> this<00:02:05.870> little<00:02:06.110> snowball<00:02:06.770> but

00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:07.370 
started off as this little snowball but

00:02:07.370 --> 00:02:08.410 
started off as this little snowball but
what's<00:02:07.580> it<00:02:07.700> doing<00:02:07.940> it's<00:02:08.060> just<00:02:08.149> rolling

00:02:08.410 --> 00:02:08.420 
what's it doing it's just rolling

00:02:08.420 --> 00:02:10.900 
what's it doing it's just rolling
rolling<00:02:08.960> rolling<00:02:09.289> them<00:02:09.770> rooms<00:02:10.490> are<00:02:10.640> like<00:02:10.759> that

00:02:10.900 --> 00:02:10.910 
rolling rolling them rooms are like that

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:12.150 
rolling rolling them rooms are like that
to<00:02:11.030> me<00:02:11.120> if<00:02:11.210> you<00:02:11.330> just<00:02:11.540> let<00:02:11.750> them<00:02:11.870> roll

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:12.160 
to me if you just let them roll

00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:14.199 
to me if you just let them roll
sometimes<00:02:13.160> you'll<00:02:13.280> have<00:02:13.370> to<00:02:13.490> do<00:02:13.610> anything<00:02:13.940> but

00:02:14.199 --> 00:02:14.209 
sometimes you'll have to do anything but

00:02:14.209 --> 00:02:17.200 
sometimes you'll have to do anything but
just<00:02:14.390> let<00:02:14.540> it<00:02:14.630> keep<00:02:14.750> rolling
