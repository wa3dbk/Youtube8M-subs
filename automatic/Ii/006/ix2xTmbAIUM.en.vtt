again so now you're just going to repeat

00:01:54.850 --> 00:01:58.880 
again so now you're just going to repeat
this<00:01:55.000> process<00:01:55.090> till<00:01:55.899> you<00:01:56.110> reach<00:01:56.289> the<00:01:56.320> bottom

00:01:58.880 --> 00:01:58.890 

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:01.740 

it's<00:01:59.890> actually<00:02:00.340> really<00:02:00.550> fun<00:02:00.940> and<00:02:01.149> just<00:02:01.539> take<00:02:01.720> a

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:01.750 
it's actually really fun and just take a

00:02:01.750 --> 00:02:03.900 
it's actually really fun and just take a
little<00:02:01.990> bit<00:02:02.259> of<00:02:02.349> practice<00:02:02.500> however<00:02:03.250> if<00:02:03.700> this

00:02:03.900 --> 00:02:03.910 
little bit of practice however if this

00:02:03.910 --> 00:02:06.600 
little bit of practice however if this
is<00:02:03.970> a<00:02:04.360> bit<00:02:04.990> too<00:02:05.229> complicated<00:02:05.649> for<00:02:05.950> you<00:02:06.190> then

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:06.610 
is a bit too complicated for you then

00:02:06.610 --> 00:02:08.880 
is a bit too complicated for you then
you<00:02:06.849> can<00:02:06.880> always<00:02:07.360> go<00:02:07.599> back<00:02:07.780> to<00:02:08.050> a<00:02:08.080> normal<00:02:08.679> braid

00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:08.890 
you can always go back to a normal braid

00:02:08.890 --> 00:02:11.339 
you can always go back to a normal braid
I<00:02:09.160> remember<00:02:09.849> you<00:02:09.970> know<00:02:10.179> so<00:02:10.509> choose<00:02:10.959> to<00:02:10.990> just

00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:46.770 
I'd like to talk the fabric just a
little<00:02:34.030> bit<00:02:34.150> so<00:02:34.420> it<00:02:34.480> creates<00:02:34.810> a<00:02:34.959> volume<00:02:35.650> I<00:02:35.800> like

00:02:46.770 --> 00:02:46.780 

00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:49.150 

using<00:02:47.780> my<00:02:47.870> fingers<00:02:48.200> I'm<00:02:48.410> going<00:02:48.620> to<00:02:48.769> create<00:02:49.069> a

00:02:49.150 --> 00:02:49.160 
using my fingers I'm going to create a

00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:51.220 
using my fingers I'm going to create a
little<00:02:49.340> hole<00:02:49.670> and<00:02:49.940> then<00:02:50.510> lift<00:02:50.780> the<00:02:50.959> bread

00:02:51.220 --> 00:02:51.230 
little hole and then lift the bread

00:02:51.230 --> 00:02:54.280 
little hole and then lift the bread
inside<00:02:52.010> this<00:02:52.370> this<00:02:53.269> will<00:02:53.450> give<00:02:53.480> it<00:02:53.750> a<00:02:53.840> softer

00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:54.290 
inside this this will give it a softer

00:02:54.290 --> 00:02:56.170 
inside this this will give it a softer
lick<00:02:54.470> and<00:02:54.680> so<00:02:55.010> the<00:02:55.220> bread<00:02:55.459> flows<00:02:55.790> in<00:02:55.970> with<00:02:56.150> a

00:02:56.170 --> 00:02:56.180 
lick and so the bread flows in with a

00:02:56.180 --> 00:03:03.850 
lick and so the bread flows in with a
hair<00:02:56.420> nicer<00:03:01.750> so<00:03:02.750> I'm<00:03:02.870> just<00:03:03.080> fixing<00:03:03.500> here<00:03:03.709> and

00:03:03.860 --> 00:03:05.949 
hair nicer so I'm just fixing here and
there<00:03:04.040> so<00:03:04.370> the<00:03:04.610> hair<00:03:04.819> falls<00:03:05.120> loosely<00:03:05.660> on<00:03:05.810> my

00:03:05.949 --> 00:03:05.959
