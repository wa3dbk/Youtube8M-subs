00:00:39.309 --> 00:00:42.900 
probably think that I'm very problematic
especially<00:00:40.210> in<00:00:40.660> restaurants<00:00:41.290> when<00:00:41.710> I<00:00:41.980> demand

00:00:42.900 --> 00:00:42.910 
especially in restaurants when I demand

00:00:42.910 --> 00:00:46.290

00:00:46.290 --> 00:00:46.300 
if you like politely that I use my tea

00:00:46.300 --> 00:00:48.420 
if you like politely that I use my tea
instead<00:00:46.930> of<00:00:47.080> the<00:00:47.320> tea<00:00:47.530> that<00:00:47.739> is<00:00:47.830> provided<00:00:48.340> by

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:48.430 
instead of the tea that is provided by

instead of the tea that is provided by
the<00:00:48.489> restaurant<00:00:53.309> the<00:00:54.309> important<00:00:55.180> thing

00:00:55.380 --> 00:00:55.390 
the restaurant the important thing

00:00:55.390 --> 00:00:59.990

00:00:59.990 --> 00:01:00.000 
really is the tea richer for me so I

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:04.229

you can press the button and everything

00:01:08.979 --> 00:01:11.999 
you can press the button and everything
stay<00:01:09.460> still<00:01:09.850> or<00:01:10.450> you<00:01:10.660> completely<00:01:11.110> focus<00:01:11.800> on

00:01:11.999 --> 00:01:12.009 
stay still or you completely focus on

the tea brewing process and in that you

00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:18.359 
the tea brewing process and in that you
know<00:01:15.720> three<00:01:16.720> to<00:01:17.080> five<00:01:17.320> minutes<00:01:17.740> maybe<00:01:17.950> 10

00:01:18.359 --> 00:01:18.369 
know three to five minutes maybe 10

00:01:18.369 --> 00:01:20.670 
know three to five minutes maybe 10
minutes<00:01:18.700> you<00:01:19.000> go<00:01:19.210> into<00:01:19.600> a<00:01:19.630> rather<00:01:19.899> meditative

state and that allows you to handle the

00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:31.080 
state and that allows you to handle the
stress<00:01:24.759> of<00:01:24.940> modern<00:01:25.330> life

00:03:08.770 --> 00:03:08.780 
the future is that people tend not to

00:03:08.780 --> 00:03:12.370 
the future is that people tend not to
understand<00:03:09.470> the<00:03:10.310> importance<00:03:10.910> of<00:03:11.180> being<00:03:11.540> here
