two black pipes they are inserted into

00:02:24.970 --> 00:02:27.900 
two black pipes they are inserted into
that<00:02:25.240> and<00:02:25.420> then<00:02:26.110> the<00:02:26.650> vacuum<00:02:27.130> from<00:02:27.310> the<00:02:27.520> engine

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:27.910 
that and then the vacuum from the engine

00:02:27.910 --> 00:02:31.980 
that and then the vacuum from the engine
sucks<00:02:28.330> out<00:02:28.600> the<00:02:30.209> hho<00:02:31.209> gas<00:02:31.480> from<00:02:31.660> the<00:02:31.750> top<00:02:31.959> of

ignition then the reaction stops and
there's<00:02:50.590> no<00:02:50.709> more<00:02:50.920> hho<00:02:51.489> gas<00:02:51.730> produced<00:02:52.270> so

00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:52.690 
there's no more hho gas produced so

00:02:52.690 --> 00:02:55.760 
there's no more hho gas produced so
there's<00:02:52.840> very<00:02:53.020> little<00:02:53.200> left<00:02:53.560> in<00:02:53.739> the<00:02:53.860> system

of h2o this is a fuse and that is a the
wire<00:03:07.480> that<00:03:07.810> would<00:03:07.959> lead<00:03:08.380> from<00:03:08.709> here<00:03:09.070> to<00:03:09.550> send

00:03:09.750 --> 00:03:09.760 
wire that would lead from here to send

00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:12.930 
wire that would lead from here to send
on<00:03:10.000> demand<00:03:10.360> system<00:03:10.840> such<00:03:11.140> as<00:03:11.310> the<00:03:12.310> windscreen

00:03:12.930 --> 00:03:12.940 
on demand system such as the windscreen

00:03:12.940 --> 00:03:15.000 
on demand system such as the windscreen
wipers<00:03:13.480> for<00:03:13.600> instance<00:03:13.959> so<00:03:14.500> when<00:03:14.709> you<00:03:14.799> switch

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:15.010 
wipers for instance so when you switch

00:03:15.010 --> 00:03:16.530 
wipers for instance so when you switch
on<00:03:15.160> the<00:03:15.220> engine<00:03:15.310> then<00:03:15.790> power<00:03:16.090> is<00:03:16.269> put<00:03:16.510> through

00:03:16.530 --> 00:03:16.540 
on the engine then power is put through

00:03:16.540 --> 00:03:18.000 
on the engine then power is put through
the<00:03:16.840> windscreen<00:03:17.049> wipers<00:03:17.530> so<00:03:17.680> that<00:03:17.799> when<00:03:17.920> you

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:18.010 
the windscreen wipers so that when you

00:03:18.010 --> 00:03:19.920 
the windscreen wipers so that when you
turn<00:03:18.370> the<00:03:18.400> switch<00:03:18.640> of<00:03:18.760> it's<00:03:19.030> raining<00:03:19.390> you<00:03:19.720> got

00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:19.930 
turn the switch of it's raining you got

00:03:19.930 --> 00:03:22.380 
turn the switch of it's raining you got
power<00:03:20.170> so<00:03:20.980> that<00:03:21.010> is<00:03:21.280> an<00:03:21.400> on-demand<00:03:21.700> system

00:03:22.380 --> 00:03:22.390 
power so that is an on-demand system

00:03:22.390 --> 00:03:24.990 
power so that is an on-demand system
then<00:03:22.930> over<00:03:23.140> here<00:03:23.290> this<00:03:23.680> is<00:03:23.830> the<00:03:23.860> negative<00:03:24.459> that

00:03:24.990 --> 00:03:25.000 
then over here this is the negative that

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:27.270 
then over here this is the negative that
would<00:03:25.180> go<00:03:25.330> to<00:03:25.390> say<00:03:25.690> the<00:03:25.810> battery<00:03:26.200> and<00:03:26.380> so

00:03:27.270 --> 00:03:27.280 
would go to say the battery and so

00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:28.560 
would go to say the battery and so
there's<00:03:27.549> your<00:03:27.610> positive<00:03:28.090> and<00:03:28.209> as<00:03:28.390> your

00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:28.570 
there's your positive and as your

00:03:28.570 --> 00:03:32.840 
there's your positive and as your
negative<00:03:28.959> and<00:03:29.320> that<00:03:29.440> of<00:03:29.680> course<00:03:29.709> is<00:03:30.130> the<00:03:30.310> fuse

00:03:32.840 --> 00:03:32.850 

00:03:32.850 --> 00:03:35.550 

every<00:03:33.850> now<00:03:34.000> and<00:03:34.180> again<00:03:34.209> you<00:03:34.900> will<00:03:34.989> have<00:03:35.170> to<00:03:35.320> top

00:03:35.550 --> 00:03:35.560 
every now and again you will have to top

00:03:35.560 --> 00:03:37.350 
every now and again you will have to top

this particular unit here it is designed
for<00:04:34.970> the<00:04:35.630> larger<00:04:36.080> engine<00:04:36.470> so<00:04:36.770> that<00:04:36.800> you<00:04:37.400> can

00:04:37.540 --> 00:04:37.550 
for the larger engine so that you can

00:04:37.550 --> 00:04:41.439 
for the larger engine so that you can
get<00:04:37.699> as<00:04:38.539> much<00:04:38.840> hho<00:04:39.710> gas<00:04:39.949> into<00:04:40.280> the<00:04:40.310> system<00:04:40.729> now

00:04:41.439 --> 00:04:41.449 
get as much hho gas into the system now

00:04:41.449 --> 00:04:43.719

have a look at a barbecue for instance

00:04:46.160 --> 00:04:48.310 
have a look at a barbecue for instance
if<00:04:46.220> you<00:04:46.280> have<00:04:46.400> a<00:04:46.430> barbecue<00:04:47.030> you'll<00:04:47.780> put<00:04:48.050> some

00:04:48.310 --> 00:04:48.320 
if you have a barbecue you'll put some

00:04:48.320 --> 00:04:50.200 
if you have a barbecue you'll put some
paper<00:04:48.860> in<00:04:49.160> you<00:04:49.310> put<00:04:49.490> some<00:04:49.669> borders<00:04:50.030> and

00:04:50.200 --> 00:04:50.210 
paper in you put some borders and

00:04:50.210 --> 00:04:52.480 
paper in you put some borders and
kindling<00:04:50.570> and<00:04:50.780> then<00:04:51.289> you<00:04:51.410> put<00:04:51.560> chocolate<00:04:52.220> on

00:04:52.480 --> 00:04:52.490 
kindling and then you put chocolate on

00:04:52.490 --> 00:04:54.640 
kindling and then you put chocolate on
top<00:04:52.550> and<00:04:53.300> you<00:04:53.509> said<00:04:53.690> the<00:04:53.780> paper<00:04:53.990> on<00:04:54.169> fire<00:04:54.199> that

00:04:54.640 --> 00:04:54.650 
top and you said the paper on fire that

00:04:54.650 --> 00:04:56.560 
top and you said the paper on fire that
says<00:04:54.860> the<00:04:54.979> wood<00:04:55.190> on<00:04:55.370> fire<00:04:55.400> that<00:04:55.699> sets<00:04:56.330> the

00:04:56.560 --> 00:04:56.570 
says the wood on fire that sets the

00:04:56.570 --> 00:05:00.790 
says the wood on fire that sets the
charcoal<00:04:57.050> on<00:04:57.080> fire<00:04:57.729> hho<00:04:58.729> gas<00:04:58.970> is<00:04:59.320> four<00:05:00.320> times

00:05:00.790 --> 00:05:00.800 
charcoal on fire hho gas is four times

00:05:00.800 --> 00:05:05.170 
charcoal on fire hho gas is four times
more<00:05:00.979> combustible<00:05:01.789> than<00:05:02.780> diesel<00:05:03.320> and<00:05:03.740> so<00:05:04.490> when

00:05:05.170 --> 00:05:05.180 
more combustible than diesel and so when

00:05:05.180 --> 00:05:08.560 
more combustible than diesel and so when
when<00:05:05.750> the<00:05:05.900> diesel<00:05:06.320> starts<00:05:06.770> to<00:05:06.919> fire<00:05:07.220> the<00:05:08.030> HHR

00:05:08.560 --> 00:05:08.570 
when the diesel starts to fire the HHR

00:05:08.570 --> 00:05:10.870 
when the diesel starts to fire the HHR
gas<00:05:08.810> will<00:05:09.050> fire<00:05:09.440> far<00:05:09.860> faster<00:05:10.220> than<00:05:10.490> and

00:05:10.870 --> 00:05:10.880 
gas will fire far faster than and

00:05:10.880 --> 00:05:13.210 
gas will fire far faster than and
therefore<00:05:11.659> burn<00:05:11.930> more<00:05:12.199> diesel<00:05:12.470> that<00:05:12.949> is<00:05:13.070> how

00:05:13.210 --> 00:05:13.220 
therefore burn more diesel that is how

00:05:13.220 --> 00:05:15.790 
therefore burn more diesel that is how
you<00:05:13.250> saving<00:05:13.789> up<00:05:13.970> to<00:05:14.150> forty<00:05:14.479> percent<00:05:14.810> on<00:05:15.110> diesel

00:05:15.790 --> 00:05:15.800 
you saving up to forty percent on diesel

00:05:15.800 --> 00:05:21.790 
you saving up to forty percent on diesel
costs<00:05:16.430> so<00:05:17.150> that<00:05:17.180> is<00:05:17.419> your<00:05:17.539> potential<00:05:18.110> man<00:05:20.800> so

00:05:21.790 --> 00:05:21.800 
costs so that is your potential man so

00:05:21.800 --> 00:05:23.589 
costs so that is your potential man so
if<00:05:21.919> your<00:05:22.070> present<00:05:22.460> be<00:05:22.520> using<00:05:22.880> say<00:05:23.060> a<00:05:23.090> thousand

00:05:23.589 --> 00:05:23.599 
if your present be using say a thousand

00:05:23.599 --> 00:05:25.810 
if your present be using say a thousand
pounds<00:05:23.780> a<00:05:24.020> week<00:05:24.199> the<00:05:24.620> potential<00:05:25.039> is<00:05:25.370> to<00:05:25.580> say

00:05:25.810 --> 00:05:25.820 
pounds a week the potential is to say

00:05:25.820 --> 00:05:28.689 
pounds a week the potential is to say
with<00:05:26.449> a<00:05:26.479> 40-percent<00:05:27.199> saving<00:05:27.590> up<00:05:27.949> to<00:05:28.039> 400

00:05:28.689 --> 00:05:28.699 
with a 40-percent saving up to 400

00:05:28.699 --> 00:05:31.540 
with a 40-percent saving up to 400
pounds<00:05:29.030> of<00:05:29.090> that<00:05:29.289> so<00:05:30.289> there's<00:05:31.220> a<00:05:31.340> lot<00:05:31.490> of

00:05:31.540 --> 00:05:31.550 
pounds of that so there's a lot of

00:05:31.550 --> 00:05:34.570 
pounds of that so there's a lot of
potential<00:05:31.970> here<00:05:32.180> and<00:05:32.630> these<00:05:32.990> units<00:05:33.710> will<00:05:33.949> pair

00:05:34.570 --> 00:05:34.580 
potential here and these units will pair

00:05:34.580 --> 00:05:36.430 
potential here and these units will pair
themselves<00:05:35.360> in<00:05:35.479> the<00:05:35.570> first<00:05:35.810> month<00:05:36.110> or<00:05:36.259> month

and<00:05:36.710> a<00:05:36.740> half<00:05:36.770> but<00:05:37.759> that<00:05:37.789> is<00:05:37.940> how<00:05:38.210> fast<00:05:38.479> if<00:05:38.990> you

00:05:39.399 --> 00:05:39.409 
and a half but that is how fast if you

00:05:39.409 --> 00:05:41.379 
and a half but that is how fast if you

and all you've got to do is find a spot
for<00:05:48.650> them<00:05:49.009> usually<00:05:49.909> there's<00:05:50.389> a<00:05:50.680> very<00:05:51.680> easy<00:05:52.430> and

but in big trucks you've got plenty of
room<00:06:08.479> all<00:06:08.780> over<00:06:09.080> the<00:06:09.259> place<00:06:09.500> not<00:06:09.740> like<00:06:09.949> car

00:06:10.899 --> 00:06:10.909 
room all over the place not like car

00:06:10.909 --> 00:06:13.340 
room all over the place not like car
engines<00:06:11.270> where<00:06:11.449> you<00:06:11.990> really<00:06:12.259> only<00:06:12.440> have<00:06:12.560> the

00:06:13.340 --> 00:06:13.350 
engines where you really only have the

00:06:13.350 --> 00:06:14.960 
engines where you really only have the
sherry<00:06:13.560> between<00:06:14.040> the<00:06:14.220> grill<00:06:14.610> and<00:06:14.880> the

00:06:14.960 --> 00:06:14.970 
sherry between the grill and the

00:06:14.970 --> 00:06:16.910 
sherry between the grill and the
radiator<00:06:15.330> so<00:06:15.990> trucks<00:06:16.260> actually<00:06:16.590> have<00:06:16.710> a<00:06:16.740> lot

00:06:16.910 --> 00:06:16.920 
radiator so trucks actually have a lot

00:06:16.920 --> 00:06:19.010 
radiator so trucks actually have a lot
more<00:06:17.130> we<00:06:17.280> just<00:06:17.460> don't<00:06:17.610> want<00:06:17.850> the<00:06:18.030> system<00:06:18.390> put

00:06:19.010 --> 00:06:19.020 
more we just don't want the system put

00:06:19.020 --> 00:06:21.080 
more we just don't want the system put
for<00:06:19.200> instance<00:06:19.530> on<00:06:20.160> the<00:06:20.370> engine<00:06:20.640> itself<00:06:20.760> it

00:06:21.080 --> 00:06:21.090 
for instance on the engine itself it

00:06:21.090 --> 00:06:22.640 
for instance on the engine itself it
should<00:06:21.270> be<00:06:21.420> moved<00:06:21.660> away<00:06:21.810> and<00:06:22.140> kept<00:06:22.350> away<00:06:22.590> so

00:06:22.640 --> 00:06:22.650 
should be moved away and kept away so

00:06:22.650 --> 00:06:25.150 
should be moved away and kept away so
whether<00:06:23.280> we're<00:06:23.970> as<00:06:24.570> far<00:06:24.810> away<00:06:24.900> as<00:06:25.020> possible

00:06:25.150 --> 00:06:25.160 
whether we're as far away as possible

00:06:25.160 --> 00:06:27.770 
whether we're as far away as possible
but<00:06:26.160> as<00:06:26.430> I<00:06:26.520> said<00:06:26.580> it's<00:06:26.880> a<00:06:26.940> very<00:06:26.970> simple<00:06:27.330> system

00:06:27.770 --> 00:06:27.780 
but as I said it's a very simple system

00:06:27.780 --> 00:06:30.980 
but as I said it's a very simple system
to<00:06:27.900> install<00:06:28.260> and<00:06:28.860> it<00:06:28.980> will<00:06:29.190> and<00:06:29.990> potentially

00:06:30.980 --> 00:06:30.990 
to install and it will and potentially

00:06:30.990 --> 00:06:32.870 
to install and it will and potentially
save<00:06:31.350> you<00:06:31.530> a<00:06:31.560> lot<00:06:31.740> of<00:06:31.800> money<00:06:31.920> thank<00:06:32.730> you<00:06:32.850> very
