expensive i believe it was around forty
dollars<00:00:49.260> 40<00:00:49.739> 45<00:00:50.190> which<00:00:50.460> is<00:00:50.610> very<00:00:50.910> expensive

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:51.180 
dollars 40 45 which is very expensive

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:54.200

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:55.910 
and i used it all up in less than two
months<00:00:54.360> i<00:00:54.690> think<00:00:54.840> it's<00:00:55.079> a<00:00:55.170> great<00:00:55.289> packaging

00:00:55.910 --> 00:00:55.920 
months i think it's a great packaging

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:58.069 
months i think it's a great packaging
for<00:00:56.160> a<00:00:56.190> toner<00:00:56.520> everything's<00:00:57.270> nice<00:00:57.480> and<00:00:57.510> sleek

for a toner everything's nice and sleek

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:01.310

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:03.110 
but the smell is weird and it doesn't
really<00:01:01.410> do<00:01:01.680> anything<00:01:01.949> so<00:01:02.370> i<00:01:02.399> definitely<00:01:02.699> would

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:03.120 
really do anything so i definitely would

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:05.060 
really do anything so i definitely would
not<00:01:03.270> recommend<00:01:03.809> this<00:01:04.019> nor<00:01:04.799> would<00:01:05.040> i

00:01:05.060 --> 00:01:05.070
