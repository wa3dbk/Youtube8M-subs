00:03:38.010 --> 00:03:38.020 
of them the military class 2 is kind of

00:03:38.020 --> 00:03:40.140 
of them the military class 2 is kind of
starting<00:03:38.200> that<00:03:38.500> and<00:03:38.740> so<00:03:39.310> with<00:03:39.430> military<00:03:39.850> class

00:03:40.140 --> 00:03:40.150 
starting that and so with military class

00:03:40.150 --> 00:03:42.120 
starting that and so with military class
what<00:03:40.660> we<00:03:40.810> have<00:03:40.990> different<00:03:41.380> of<00:03:41.470> military<00:03:41.860> class

00:03:42.120 --> 00:03:42.130 
what we have different of military class

00:03:42.130 --> 00:03:44.670 
what we have different of military class
too<00:03:42.430> is<00:03:42.730> we've<00:03:43.330> increased<00:03:43.750> our<00:03:44.140> children

00:03:44.670 --> 00:03:44.680

are<00:04:07.420> thirty<00:04:08.050> percent<00:04:08.530> power<00:04:08.890> boost<00:04:09.489> so<00:04:10.360> again

00:04:10.590 --> 00:04:10.600 
are thirty percent power boost so again

00:04:10.600 --> 00:04:13.199 
are thirty percent power boost so again

00:04:28.440 --> 00:04:28.450 
going to see us making big big steps

00:04:28.450 --> 00:04:31.470 
going to see us making big big steps
ahead<00:04:28.630> of<00:04:28.780> everybody<00:04:28.960> else<00:04:30.090> not<00:04:31.090> only<00:04:31.300> that

00:04:31.470 --> 00:04:31.480 
ahead of everybody else not only that

00:04:31.480 --> 00:04:34.080 
ahead of everybody else not only that
but<00:04:31.930> one<00:04:32.590> of<00:04:32.680> the<00:04:32.770> big<00:04:32.979> staple<00:04:33.280> features<00:04:33.850> of

00:04:34.080 --> 00:04:34.090 
but one of the big staple features of

00:04:34.090 --> 00:04:37.050 
but one of the big staple features of
military<00:04:34.510> class<00:04:34.780> one<00:04:35.110> was<00:04:35.950> using<00:04:36.340> tantalum

00:04:37.050 --> 00:04:37.060 
military class one was using tantalum

00:04:37.060 --> 00:04:39.450 
military class one was using tantalum
capacitors<00:04:38.050> these<00:04:38.770> are<00:04:38.919> solid<00:04:39.130> state

00:04:39.450 --> 00:04:39.460 
capacitors these are solid state

capacitors with a low profile provides
extreme<00:04:42.460> cooling<00:04:42.850> provides<00:04:43.660> the<00:04:43.840> best<00:04:44.050> power

00:04:44.400 --> 00:04:44.410 
extreme cooling provides the best power

00:04:44.410 --> 00:04:47.250 
extreme cooling provides the best power
supply<00:04:45.340> to<00:04:45.669> the<00:04:45.850> chipset<00:04:46.300> and<00:04:46.479> the<00:04:46.600> CPU<00:04:46.990> and

supply to the chipset and the CPU and

00:04:47.260 --> 00:04:49.230 
supply to the chipset and the CPU and
again<00:04:48.040> we're<00:04:48.250> bringing<00:04:48.550> that<00:04:48.640> back<00:04:48.850> right

00:04:49.230 --> 00:04:49.240 
again we're bringing that back right

00:04:49.240 --> 00:04:51.390 
again we're bringing that back right
it's<00:04:49.540> been<00:04:49.690> doing<00:04:49.930> so<00:04:50.110> well<00:04:50.140> and<00:04:50.890> this<00:04:51.010> is<00:04:51.190> kind

00:04:51.390 --> 00:04:51.400 
it's been doing so well and this is kind

00:04:51.400 --> 00:04:53.190 
it's been doing so well and this is kind
of<00:04:51.430> a<00:04:51.520> staple<00:04:51.970> component<00:04:52.450> of<00:04:52.510> military<00:04:52.900> class

00:04:53.190 --> 00:04:53.200 
of a staple component of military class

00:04:53.200 --> 00:04:56.190 
of a staple component of military class
too<00:04:53.520> and<00:04:54.520> why<00:04:54.880> we<00:04:55.150> call<00:04:55.360> it<00:04:55.390> military<00:04:55.930> class

00:04:56.190 --> 00:04:56.200 
too and why we call it military class

00:04:56.200 --> 00:04:58.110 
too and why we call it military class
too<00:04:56.470> because<00:04:57.190> I<00:04:57.340> see<00:04:57.610> cats

00:04:58.110 --> 00:04:58.120 
too because I see cats

00:04:58.120 --> 00:05:00.659 
too because I see cats

that if these components do not fail for
the<00:05:15.460> high-end<00:05:15.610> do<00:05:16.270> you<00:05:16.360> guys<00:05:16.540> deserve<00:05:17.110> the

00:05:17.280 --> 00:05:17.290 
the high-end do you guys deserve the

00:05:17.290 --> 00:05:19.290 
the high-end do you guys deserve the
same<00:05:17.440> quality<00:05:17.949> and<00:05:18.130> that's<00:05:18.520> what<00:05:18.639> FSI<00:05:19.000> brings

00:05:19.290 --> 00:05:19.300 
same quality and that's what FSI brings

00:05:19.300 --> 00:05:23.219 
same quality and that's what FSI brings
a<00:05:19.419> military<00:05:19.840> class<00:05:20.110> too<00:05:21.030> so<00:05:22.030> again<00:05:22.270> again<00:05:23.080> this

00:05:23.219 --> 00:05:23.229 
a military class too so again again this

00:05:23.229 --> 00:05:24.570 
a military class too so again again this
is<00:05:23.290> kind<00:05:23.560> of<00:05:23.650> a<00:05:23.770> repeating<00:05:24.310> thing<00:05:24.460> you're

00:05:24.570 --> 00:05:24.580 
is kind of a repeating thing you're

00:05:24.580 --> 00:05:25.740 
is kind of a repeating thing you're
going<00:05:24.669> to<00:05:24.729> see<00:05:24.910> a<00:05:24.940> lot<00:05:25.000> of<00:05:25.180> the<00:05:25.360> things<00:05:25.570> we're

boost to the internal graphics and gives

00:06:48.730 --> 00:06:50.730 
boost to the internal graphics and gives
you<00:06:48.850> better<00:06:49.000> performance<00:06:49.090> and<00:06:49.810> so<00:06:50.290> the<00:06:50.410> 3dmark

00:06:50.730 --> 00:06:50.740 
you better performance and so the 3dmark

00:06:50.740 --> 00:06:52.290 
you better performance and so the 3dmark
show<00:06:51.190> that<00:06:51.460> you're<00:06:51.610> getting<00:06:51.700> a<00:06:51.910> better<00:06:52.060> booth

00:06:52.290 --> 00:06:52.300 
show that you're getting a better booth

00:06:52.300 --> 00:06:54.240 
show that you're getting a better booth
