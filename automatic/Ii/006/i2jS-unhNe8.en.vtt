really really be able to do a handstand
and<00:00:42.300> then<00:00:42.390> flip<00:00:42.720> board<00:00:42.930> so<00:00:43.830> that's<00:00:44.040> the<00:00:44.190> easier

00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:44.460 
and then flip board so that's the easier

00:00:44.460 --> 00:01:12.680 
and then flip board so that's the easier
way<00:00:44.610> of<00:00:44.640> doing<00:00:44.760> up<00:01:10.790> out<00:01:11.790> of<00:01:11.940> your<00:01:12.090> nose<00:01:12.360> because
