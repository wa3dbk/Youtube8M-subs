the<00:00:07.630> real<00:00:07.990> number<00:00:08.590> system<00:00:09.750> numbers<00:00:10.750> can<00:00:10.990> be

00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:11.020 
the real number system numbers can be

00:00:11.020 --> 00:00:14.400 
the real number system numbers can be
classified<00:00:11.410> in<00:00:12.070> many<00:00:12.490> different<00:00:12.820> ways<00:00:13.410> let's

number because it's a ratio it's a
fraction<00:02:11.250> rational<00:02:12.250> numbers<00:02:12.549> also<00:02:12.819> include

00:02:13.879 --> 00:02:13.889 
fraction rational numbers also include

00:02:13.889 --> 00:02:15.830 
fraction rational numbers also include
repeating<00:02:14.889> and

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:15.840 
repeating and

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:20.360 
repeating and
emanating<00:02:16.280> decimals<00:02:17.280> like<00:02:19.040> three<00:02:20.040> tenths

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:20.370 
emanating decimals like three tenths

00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:24.979 
emanating decimals like three tenths
repeating<00:02:21.150> and<00:02:22.190> 25<00:02:23.190> hundredths<00:02:24.030> so<00:02:24.660> three

00:02:24.979 --> 00:02:24.989 
repeating and 25 hundredths so three

00:02:24.989 --> 00:02:27.259 
repeating and 25 hundredths so three
tenths<00:02:25.290> repeating<00:02:25.769> is<00:02:25.950> the<00:02:26.790> repeating

00:02:27.259 --> 00:02:27.269 
tenths repeating is the repeating

00:02:27.269 --> 00:02:29.509 
tenths repeating is the repeating
decimal<00:02:27.300> and<00:02:28.019> it<00:02:28.500> can<00:02:28.650> be<00:02:28.769> expressed<00:02:29.250> as<00:02:29.459> a

00:02:29.509 --> 00:02:29.519 
decimal and it can be expressed as a

00:02:29.519 --> 00:02:32.990 
decimal and it can be expressed as a
fraction<00:02:30.379> one-third<00:02:31.379> so<00:02:32.099> again<00:02:32.489> it's<00:02:32.790> a

00:02:32.990 --> 00:02:33.000 
fraction one-third so again it's a

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:34.820 
fraction one-third so again it's a
rational<00:02:33.269> number<00:02:33.569> since<00:02:34.440> it<00:02:34.590> could<00:02:34.739> be

00:02:34.820 --> 00:02:34.830 
rational number since it could be

00:02:34.830 --> 00:02:37.640 
rational number since it could be
written<00:02:35.160> as<00:02:35.340> a<00:02:35.370> ratio<00:02:36.650> twenty-five

00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:37.650 
written as a ratio twenty-five

00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:40.160 
written as a ratio twenty-five
hundredths<00:02:38.370> is<00:02:38.489> a<00:02:38.519> terminating<00:02:39.269> decimal<00:02:39.420> and

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:40.170 
hundredths is a terminating decimal and

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:43.550 
hundredths is a terminating decimal and
it<00:02:40.590> can<00:02:40.769> also<00:02:40.980> be<00:02:41.310> written<00:02:41.489> as<00:02:41.730> a<00:02:41.879> fraction<00:02:42.560> 1/4

00:02:43.550 --> 00:02:43.560 
it can also be written as a fraction 1/4

00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:45.890 
it can also be written as a fraction 1/4
so<00:02:44.250> again<00:02:44.580> it's<00:02:44.879> a<00:02:45.120> writ<00:02:45.330> it's<00:02:45.510> a<00:02:45.629> rational

00:02:45.890 --> 00:02:45.900 
so again it's a writ it's a rational

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:48.259 
so again it's a writ it's a rational
number<00:02:46.230> since<00:02:47.220> it<00:02:47.370> can<00:02:47.580> be<00:02:47.730> written<00:02:47.910> as<00:02:48.209> a

00:02:48.259 --> 00:02:48.269 
number since it can be written as a

00:02:48.269 --> 00:02:52.220 
number since it can be written as a
ratio<00:02:49.700> the<00:02:50.700> real<00:02:50.910> number<00:02:51.269> system<00:02:51.299> also

00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:52.230 
ratio the real number system also

00:02:52.230 --> 00:02:54.640 
ratio the real number system also
includes<00:02:52.680> another<00:02:52.890> set<00:02:53.700> of<00:02:53.849> numbers

00:02:54.640 --> 00:02:54.650 
includes another set of numbers

00:02:54.650 --> 00:02:58.610 
includes another set of numbers
irrational<00:02:55.650> numbers<00:02:56.900> irrational<00:02:57.900> numbers<00:02:58.290> if

00:02:58.610 --> 00:02:58.620 
irrational numbers irrational numbers if

00:02:58.620 --> 00:03:03.170 
irrational numbers irrational numbers if
we<00:02:59.220> look<00:02:59.459> at<00:02:59.640> the<00:02:59.760> word<00:03:00.560> ear<00:03:01.560> the<00:03:02.099> prefix<00:03:02.670> means

00:03:03.170 --> 00:03:03.180 
we look at the word ear the prefix means

00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:06.039 
we look at the word ear the prefix means
not<00:03:03.810> and<00:03:04.379> then<00:03:05.069> we<00:03:05.220> see<00:03:05.400> that<00:03:05.610> word<00:03:05.790> again

00:03:06.039 --> 00:03:06.049 
not and then we see that word again

00:03:06.049 --> 00:03:09.589 
not and then we see that word again
rational<00:03:07.049> so<00:03:07.670> irrational<00:03:08.670> numbers<00:03:09.000> is<00:03:09.299> the

00:03:09.589 --> 00:03:09.599 
rational so irrational numbers is the

00:03:09.599 --> 00:03:13.100 
rational so irrational numbers is the
set<00:03:10.079> of<00:03:10.290> numbers<00:03:10.470> that<00:03:10.680> are<00:03:10.920> not<00:03:11.459> rational<00:03:12.110> or

00:03:13.100 --> 00:03:13.110 
set of numbers that are not rational or

00:03:13.110 --> 00:03:15.559 
set of numbers that are not rational or
numbers<00:03:13.799> that<00:03:14.010> cannot<00:03:14.579> be<00:03:15.090> written<00:03:15.299> as<00:03:15.510> a

00:03:15.559 --> 00:03:15.569 
numbers that cannot be written as a

00:03:15.569 --> 00:03:18.800 
numbers that cannot be written as a
ratio<00:03:15.930> which<00:03:16.500> means<00:03:17.129> numbers<00:03:17.760> that<00:03:17.970> cannot<00:03:18.420> be

00:03:18.800 --> 00:03:18.810 
ratio which means numbers that cannot be

00:03:18.810 --> 00:03:22.129 
ratio which means numbers that cannot be
written<00:03:19.290> as<00:03:19.500> a<00:03:19.560> fraction<00:03:20.720> this<00:03:21.720> set<00:03:22.019> of

00:03:22.129 --> 00:03:22.139 
written as a fraction this set of

00:03:22.139 --> 00:03:25.550 
written as a fraction this set of
numbers<00:03:22.260> includes<00:03:22.889> things<00:03:23.130> like<00:03:23.340> high<00:03:24.500> pi<00:03:25.500> is

00:03:25.550 --> 00:03:25.560 
numbers includes things like high pi is

00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:33.979 
numbers includes things like high pi is
an<00:03:25.950> irrational<00:03:26.250> number<00:03:27.239> it's<00:03:31.190> 3.14159<00:03:32.989> etc

00:03:33.979 --> 00:03:33.989 
an irrational number it's 3.14159 etc

00:03:33.989 --> 00:03:38.800 
an irrational number it's 3.14159 etc
etc<00:03:34.109> etc<00:03:34.670> that<00:03:35.670> number<00:03:36.180> goes<00:03:36.510> on<00:03:36.810> for<00:03:37.590> ever

00:03:38.800 --> 00:03:38.810 
etc etc that number goes on for ever

00:03:38.810 --> 00:03:42.500 
etc etc that number goes on for ever
meaning<00:03:39.810> it<00:03:39.959> doesn't<00:03:40.290> repeat<00:03:40.829> and<00:03:41.160> it<00:03:42.030> doesn't

00:03:42.500 --> 00:03:42.510 
meaning it doesn't repeat and it doesn't

00:03:42.510 --> 00:03:45.170 
meaning it doesn't repeat and it doesn't
terminate<00:03:43.190> therefore<00:03:44.190> it<00:03:44.310> cannot<00:03:44.819> be<00:03:45.000> written

00:03:45.170 --> 00:03:45.180 
terminate therefore it cannot be written

00:03:45.180 --> 00:03:48.490 
terminate therefore it cannot be written
as<00:03:45.389> a<00:03:45.419> fraction<00:03:45.889> so<00:03:46.889> it's<00:03:47.099> not<00:03:47.370> rational

00:03:48.490 --> 00:03:48.500 
as a fraction so it's not rational

00:03:48.500 --> 00:03:51.500 
as a fraction so it's not rational
another<00:03:49.500> example<00:03:50.130> would<00:03:50.250> be<00:03:50.310> like<00:03:50.669> the<00:03:51.209> square

00:03:51.500 --> 00:03:51.510 
another example would be like the square

00:03:51.510 --> 00:03:55.809 
another example would be like the square
root<00:03:51.810> of<00:03:52.019> 2<00:03:52.440> the<00:03:53.430> square<00:03:53.459> root<00:03:53.940> of<00:03:54.090> 2<00:03:54.359> is<00:03:54.810> 1

00:03:55.809 --> 00:03:55.819 
root of 2 the square root of 2 is 1

00:03:55.819 --> 00:04:03.379 
root of 2 the square root of 2 is 1
point<00:03:56.819> 4<00:03:57.389> 1<00:03:57.660> 4<00:03:58.639> etc<00:03:59.639> etc<00:03:59.970> etc<00:04:01.340> again<00:04:02.340> it<00:04:02.669> goes<00:04:03.000> on

00:04:03.379 --> 00:04:03.389 
point 4 1 4 etc etc etc again it goes on

00:04:03.389 --> 00:04:07.640 
point 4 1 4 etc etc etc again it goes on
forever<00:04:04.430> so<00:04:05.430> it's<00:04:05.669> not<00:04:05.940> rational<00:04:06.810> it<00:04:07.109> doesn't

00:04:07.640 --> 00:04:07.650 
forever so it's not rational it doesn't

00:04:07.650 --> 00:04:11.300 
forever so it's not rational it doesn't
repeat<00:04:08.010> like<00:04:08.280> 0.33<00:04:09.209> 3<00:04:09.510> 3<00:04:09.780> 3<00:04:09.959> 3<00:04:10.260> 3<00:04:10.560> and<00:04:10.829> it

00:04:11.300 --> 00:04:11.310 
repeat like 0.33 3 3 3 3 3 and it

00:04:11.310 --> 00:04:14.420 
repeat like 0.33 3 3 3 3 3 and it
doesn't<00:04:11.760> terminate<00:04:11.970> it<00:04:12.359> never<00:04:12.900> in<00:04:13.290> it<00:04:13.739> goes<00:04:14.069> on

00:04:14.420 --> 00:04:14.430 
doesn't terminate it never in it goes on

00:04:14.430 --> 00:04:17.779 
doesn't terminate it never in it goes on
forever<00:04:14.940> so<00:04:15.480> the<00:04:16.410> real<00:04:16.680> number<00:04:17.070> system<00:04:17.099> is

00:04:17.779 --> 00:04:17.789 
forever so the real number system is

00:04:17.789 --> 00:04:20.629 
forever so the real number system is
made<00:04:18.750> up<00:04:18.989> of<00:04:19.200> two<00:04:19.650> different<00:04:20.220> groups<00:04:20.400> of

00:04:20.629 --> 00:04:20.639 
made up of two different groups of

00:04:20.639 --> 00:04:24.050 
made up of two different groups of
numbers<00:04:20.959> rational<00:04:21.959> numbers<00:04:22.320> and<00:04:23.060> irrational

00:04:24.050 --> 00:04:24.060 
numbers rational numbers and irrational

00:04:24.060 --> 00:04:27.160 
numbers rational numbers and irrational
numbers

00:04:27.160 --> 00:04:27.170 

00:04:27.170 --> 00:04:37.250 

you

00:04:37.250 --> 00:04:37.260 

00:04:37.260 --> 00:04:39.320
