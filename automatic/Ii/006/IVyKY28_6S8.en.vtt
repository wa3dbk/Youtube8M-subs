your<00:01:06.450> pants<00:01:06.750> because<00:01:06.840> they<00:01:07.110> sometimes<00:01:07.380> make

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:07.560 
your pants because they sometimes make

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:10.310

these like gel cases for the iphone and
it's<00:01:10.770> really<00:01:11.040> hard<00:01:11.250> to<00:01:11.490> get<00:01:11.880> it<00:01:12.030> out<00:01:12.150> of<00:01:12.180> your

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:12.330 
it's really hard to get it out of your

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:14.210 
it's really hard to get it out of your
you<00:01:12.630> know<00:01:12.720> your<00:01:12.869> pockets<00:01:13.439> especially<00:01:13.890> viewing

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:14.220 
you know your pockets especially viewing

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:16.160 
you know your pockets especially viewing
jeans<00:01:14.490> or<00:01:14.790> if<00:01:14.880> the<00:01:14.970> pocket<00:01:15.330> is<00:01:15.479> pretty<00:01:16.080> much

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:16.170 
jeans or if the pocket is pretty much

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:18.080 
jeans or if the pocket is pretty much
the<00:01:16.229> same<00:01:16.439> size<00:01:16.710> as<00:01:16.979> the<00:01:17.159> as<00:01:17.549> the<00:01:17.640> phone<00:01:17.939> itself

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:18.090 
the same size as the as the phone itself

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:20.359 
the same size as the as the phone itself
so<00:01:18.630> I<00:01:18.869> wanted<00:01:19.350> to<00:01:19.409> try<00:01:19.500> it<00:01:19.680> out<00:01:19.830> i<00:01:19.890> think<00:01:20.100> this

00:01:20.359 --> 00:01:20.369 
so I wanted to try it out i think this

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:23.270 
so I wanted to try it out i think this
is<00:01:20.490> like<00:01:20.580> 999<00:01:21.060> so<00:01:22.020> as<00:01:22.170> far<00:01:22.320> as<00:01:22.380> cases<00:01:22.860> go<00:01:23.040> it's

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:23.280 
is like 999 so as far as cases go it's

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:25.100 
is like 999 so as far as cases go it's
it's<00:01:23.610> really<00:01:23.880> cheap<00:01:24.119> in<00:01:24.330> comparison<00:01:24.360> to<00:01:24.900> a<00:01:24.960> lot

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:25.110 
it's really cheap in comparison to a lot

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:26.210 
it's really cheap in comparison to a lot
of<00:01:25.229> the<00:01:25.290> other<00:01:25.439> cases<00:01:25.680> that<00:01:25.950> you<00:01:25.979> might<00:01:26.189> find

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:26.220 
of the other cases that you might find

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:29.060 
of the other cases that you might find
like<00:01:26.850> at<00:01:26.970> the<00:01:27.090> apple<00:01:27.390> store<00:01:27.710> best<00:01:28.710> buy<00:01:28.829> or

i really like this one but the only the
only<00:01:57.990> drawback<00:01:58.710> that<00:01:58.740> i<00:01:58.920> would<00:01:59.100> have<00:01:59.219> to<00:01:59.280> say

00:01:59.389 --> 00:01:59.399 
only drawback that i would have to say

00:01:59.399 --> 00:02:01.910 
only drawback that i would have to say
about<00:01:59.700> this<00:01:59.850> particular<00:02:00.479> case<00:02:00.689> and<00:02:01.049> it's

00:02:01.910 --> 00:02:01.920 
about this particular case and it's

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:03.830 
about this particular case and it's
actually<00:02:02.219> a<00:02:02.280> pro<00:02:02.520> anticon<00:02:02.969> you<00:02:03.509> know<00:02:03.630> it<00:02:03.719> has

00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:03.840 
actually a pro anticon you know it has

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:06.530 
actually a pro anticon you know it has
these<00:02:04.619> little<00:02:04.740> holes<00:02:05.040> and<00:02:05.340> these<00:02:05.700> ridges<00:02:06.270> cut

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:06.540 
these little holes and these ridges cut

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:08.059 
these little holes and these ridges cut
into<00:02:06.810> it<00:02:06.960> and<00:02:07.380> that's<00:02:07.560> really<00:02:07.860> good<00:02:08.039> because

00:02:08.059 --> 00:02:08.069 
into it and that's really good because

00:02:08.069 --> 00:02:09.740 
into it and that's really good because
it<00:02:08.429> gives<00:02:08.520> you<00:02:08.670> good<00:02:08.849> traction<00:02:09.149> and<00:02:09.479> lets<00:02:09.629> you

00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:09.750 
it gives you good traction and lets you

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:11.420 
it gives you good traction and lets you
hold<00:02:09.899> on<00:02:10.080> to<00:02:10.259> the<00:02:10.379> actual<00:02:10.530> phone<00:02:10.920> as<00:02:11.190> you're

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:11.430 
hold on to the actual phone as you're

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:13.550 
hold on to the actual phone as you're
using<00:02:11.610> it<00:02:11.879> but<00:02:12.450> the<00:02:12.569> problem<00:02:12.900> is<00:02:13.050> because

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:13.560 
using it but the problem is because

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:15.589 
using it but the problem is because
there's<00:02:13.709> holes<00:02:13.980> cut<00:02:14.250> out<00:02:14.280> it<00:02:15.090> tends<00:02:15.360> to<00:02:15.450> get

00:02:15.589 --> 00:02:15.599 
there's holes cut out it tends to get

00:02:15.599 --> 00:02:17.089 
there's holes cut out it tends to get
really<00:02:15.660> really<00:02:16.140> dirty<00:02:16.380> and<00:02:16.560> I'll<00:02:16.709> take<00:02:16.890> it<00:02:17.010> off

00:02:17.089 --> 00:02:17.099
