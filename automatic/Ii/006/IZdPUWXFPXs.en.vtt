00:03:04.449 --> 00:03:04.459 
Lego here a lot of low Lego where we

00:03:04.459 --> 00:03:05.830 
Lego here a lot of low Lego where we
have<00:03:04.549> our<00:03:04.670> instructions<00:03:05.150> there<00:03:05.420> in<00:03:05.660> a

00:03:05.830 --> 00:03:05.840 
have our instructions there in a

00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:08.349 
have our instructions there in a
cardboard<00:03:06.459> protected<00:03:07.459> back<00:03:07.760> we'll<00:03:08.030> get<00:03:08.209> that

00:03:08.349 --> 00:03:08.359 
cardboard protected back we'll get that

00:03:08.359 --> 00:03:09.729 
cardboard protected back we'll get that
out<00:03:08.599> in<00:03:08.959> a<00:03:09.079> second

00:03:09.729 --> 00:03:09.739 
out in a second

00:03:09.739 --> 00:03:14.500 
out in a second
so<00:03:11.319> numbered<00:03:12.319> bags<00:03:12.560> we<00:03:13.099> have<00:03:13.310> one<00:03:13.819> through<00:03:14.299> two

00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:14.510 
so numbered bags we have one through two

00:03:14.510 --> 00:03:16.539 
so numbered bags we have one through two
several<00:03:15.019> that<00:03:15.200> seven<00:03:15.680> then<00:03:15.829> multiple<00:03:16.220> bags<00:03:16.400> in

00:03:16.539 --> 00:03:16.549 
several that seven then multiple bags in

00:03:16.549 --> 00:03:20.819 
several that seven then multiple bags in
each<00:03:16.639> section<00:03:16.910> so<00:03:17.269> we've<00:03:17.419> got<00:03:17.889> two<00:03:18.889> big<00:03:19.099> ones

00:03:20.819 --> 00:03:20.829 
each section so we've got two big ones

00:03:20.829 --> 00:03:28.310 
each section so we've got two big ones
three<00:03:21.829> back<00:03:22.040> to<00:03:22.310> s3<00:03:24.130> bag<00:03:25.130> threes

00:03:28.310 --> 00:03:28.320 

00:03:28.320 --> 00:03:37.170 

three<00:03:29.320> bag<00:03:29.530> Falls<00:03:32.190> three<00:03:33.190> bag<00:03:33.370> vibes<00:03:35.910> two<00:03:36.910> bag

00:03:37.170 --> 00:03:37.180 
three bag Falls three bag vibes two bag

00:03:37.180 --> 00:03:45.150 
three bag Falls three bag vibes two bag
six<00:03:37.510> and<00:03:40.710> three<00:03:41.710> bag<00:03:42.190> sevens<00:03:43.740> so<00:03:44.740> if<00:03:44.830> my<00:03:44.950> math

00:03:45.150 --> 00:03:45.160 
six and three bag sevens so if my math

00:03:45.160 --> 00:03:47.370 
six and three bag sevens so if my math
is<00:03:45.190> right<00:03:45.370> that's<00:03:45.730> a<00:03:45.820> total<00:03:46.240> of<00:03:46.300> 19<00:03:46.810> bags<00:03:47.110> there

00:03:47.370 --> 00:03:47.380 
is right that's a total of 19 bags there

00:03:47.380 --> 00:03:51.800 
is right that's a total of 19 bags there
is<00:03:47.410> also<00:03:47.770> a<00:03:49.080> unnumbered<00:03:50.080> bag<00:03:50.290> which<00:03:50.560> has<00:03:50.830> a

00:03:51.800 --> 00:03:51.810 
is also a unnumbered bag which has a

00:03:51.810 --> 00:03:55.950 
is also a unnumbered bag which has a
number<00:03:52.810> of<00:03:52.980> plates<00:03:54.240> inside<00:03:55.240> as<00:03:55.450> you<00:03:55.570> see<00:03:55.780> there

00:03:55.950 --> 00:03:55.960 
number of plates inside as you see there

00:03:55.960 --> 00:04:02.640 
number of plates inside as you see there
so<00:03:57.450> that<00:03:58.450> should<00:03:58.870> be<00:03:59.640> 20<00:04:00.640> bags<00:04:01.180> in<00:04:01.420> total<00:04:01.840> I'm

00:04:02.640 --> 00:04:02.650 
so that should be 20 bags in total I'm

00:04:02.650 --> 00:04:03.990 
so that should be 20 bags in total I'm
going<00:04:02.950> to<00:04:03.070> assume<00:04:03.280> when<00:04:03.460> I<00:04:03.550> even<00:04:03.700> double

00:04:03.990 --> 00:04:04.000 
going to assume when I even double

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:05.670 
going to assume when I even double
counted<00:04:04.390> something<00:04:04.720> or<00:04:04.840> missed<00:04:05.050> a<00:04:05.200> small<00:04:05.500> bag

00:04:05.670 --> 00:04:05.680 
counted something or missed a small bag

00:04:05.680 --> 00:04:06.840 
counted something or missed a small bag
hidden<00:04:05.920> somewhere<00:04:06.220> which<00:04:06.370> I<00:04:06.460> may<00:04:06.610> have<00:04:06.670> done

00:04:06.840 --> 00:04:06.850 
hidden somewhere which I may have done

00:04:06.850 --> 00:04:09.510 
hidden somewhere which I may have done
because<00:04:07.480> there<00:04:07.780> is<00:04:07.870> a<00:04:07.900> lot<00:04:08.110> of<00:04:08.200> Lego<00:04:08.410> so<00:04:08.680> let's

00:04:09.510 --> 00:04:09.520 
because there is a lot of Lego so let's

00:04:09.520 --> 00:04:11.720 
because there is a lot of Lego so let's
take<00:04:09.790> a<00:04:09.820> look<00:04:10.000> at<00:04:10.120> this<00:04:10.210> instructions<00:04:10.780> name

00:04:11.720 --> 00:04:11.730
