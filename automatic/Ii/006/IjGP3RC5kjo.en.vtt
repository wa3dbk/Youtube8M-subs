 the funny bochum 

00:00:17.090 --> 00:00:21.199
 hi to all guys welcome in 

00:00:19.070 --> 00:00:22.369
 this new jug tutorial in 

00:00:21.199 --> 00:00:24.320
 I will show you this new tutorial 

00:00:22.369 --> 00:00:26.419
 how to register the screen of your pc 

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:29.689
 thanks to this free software 

00:00:26.419 --> 00:00:31.070
 called open broadcaster software for 

00:00:29.689 --> 00:00:32.599
 record our screen as 

00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:34.760
 let us first connect to the 

00:00:32.599 --> 00:00:37.940
 site that I leave you description or bs 

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:41.930
 project.com how you can see and go 

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:43.960
 in the download section above at 

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:43.960
 right 

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:47.750
 select your operating system 

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:49.730
 I make windows already selected e 

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:51.050
 we do download installer i don't 

00:00:49.730 --> 00:00:53.180
 I do it because I already have it 

00:00:51.050 --> 00:00:54.770
 starting the download of the former note 

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:56.330
 Once the program has been downloaded there will be a 

00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:58.400
 hyperlink on your 

00:00:56.330 --> 00:01:00.170
 desktop you want it open 

00:00:58.400 --> 00:01:02.540
 I do not open it now from his own 

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:05.000
 here because already said and how you can 

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:07.220
 see this is the open interface 

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:09.740
 software broadcaster with my face 

00:01:07.220 --> 00:01:12.700
 repeated a casino scenes of times 

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:12.700
 hundreds of counts 

00:01:13.220 --> 00:01:17.450
 then below is the setting 

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:20.510
 of the microphone the intensity of the volume e 

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:22.070
 the intensity of the boxes here if you want it 

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:23.659
 could start streaming but in 

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:25.430
 right now I'm making a video 

00:01:23.659 --> 00:01:27.620
 therefore streaming is not possible 

00:01:25.430 --> 00:01:29.330
 here you can stop recording 

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:30.620
 here is a preview of the streaming 

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:32.780
 as I said before, now you can't 

00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:34.250
 do it because I'm recording a video here 

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:37.760
 you exit the application and here yes 

00:01:34.250 --> 00:01:39.409
 can view the plugins that are yes 

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:40.870
 he senses that he is rooted and programmed 

00:01:39.409 --> 00:01:44.900
 transitions between one scene 

00:01:40.870 --> 00:01:47.030
 Capture game-like fraps the device 

00:01:44.900 --> 00:01:48.440
 say that this is very useful if like me 

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:50.720
 you want to use the webcam and monsters 

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:53.690
 tutorial 

00:01:50.720 --> 00:01:55.370
 this I do not know sincerely and this is 

00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:58.729
 a very useful tool because it reduces the 

00:01:55.370 --> 00:02:01.100
 noise of your microphone now as it is 

00:01:58.729 --> 00:02:02.869
 makes you capture the screen because you in 

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:05.010
 right now you will have no device 

00:02:02.869 --> 00:02:08.010
 video capture and screen capture as 

00:02:05.010 --> 00:02:10.110
 I would have nothing like you do 

00:02:08.010 --> 00:02:13.350
 right click on this square 

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:15.600
 white do adds and you have to do 

00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:18.240
 capture screen if you want to capture only 

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:19.710
 the screen if you also want to capture the 

00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:22.140
 your face let's say if you want to use 

00:02:19.710 --> 00:02:27.020
 even your computer's webcam 

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:30.630
 you have to do video capture device 

00:02:27.020 --> 00:02:32.760
 as I did at the beginning there will be a 

00:02:30.630 --> 00:02:35.340
 the webcam is a bit large 

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:37.680
 webcam and to fix it you will have to click 

00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:41.040
 on your face click with the button 

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:43.530
 right to do coordinate and move where 

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:44.940
 you also want position order size 

00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:46.590
 size oppositions prefer 

00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:50.640
 possession dimensions because it is a bit 

00:02:46.590 --> 00:02:53.070
 more detailed to the option we look at 

00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:54.470
 now the settings by clicking here 

00:02:53.070 --> 00:02:57.030
 settings 

00:02:54.470 --> 00:02:59.280
 here you can see the language I put in 

00:02:57.030 --> 00:03:01.770
 Italian of course and I did enable 

00:02:59.280 --> 00:03:03.380
 the cursor on the projector because in the 

00:03:01.770 --> 00:03:06.090
 recordings if you want to do a tutorial 

00:03:03.380 --> 00:03:08.630
 it is better to use the cursor if instead 

00:03:06.090 --> 00:03:11.640
 you want to record a gameplay remove it 

00:03:08.630 --> 00:03:13.380
 own time is a bit annoying to see 

00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:16.470
 the cursor while playing in my opinion 

00:03:13.380 --> 00:03:18.420
 this them here by going on encodings 

00:03:16.470 --> 00:03:21.750
 instead you can look at the encodings 

00:03:18.420 --> 00:03:25.170
 audio and video I use a coder for 

00:03:21.750 --> 00:03:28.440
 264 wishing I could use the option 

00:03:25.170 --> 00:03:30.810
 nvidia nbn top I do not want otherwise 

00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:32.640
 certainly on low standards because of 

00:03:30.810 --> 00:03:34.530
 do this video with I know that many 

00:03:32.640 --> 00:03:37.019
 people don't have the same computer 

00:03:34.530 --> 00:03:38.400
 I mean if I want to send you a picture 

00:03:37.019 --> 00:03:40.530
 technical specifications in the next 

00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:44.250
 video or on the facebook and milan page is 

00:03:40.530 --> 00:03:46.530
 always in description exceedances 

00:03:44.250 --> 00:03:48.810
 broadcast you can choose which one 

00:03:46.530 --> 00:03:50.550
 so record your videos here in the 

00:03:48.810 --> 00:03:52.920
 mode is only on file if you want 

00:03:50.550 --> 00:03:55.170
 record only the online video type 

00:03:52.920 --> 00:03:57.660
 if you want to stream live what sutri 

00:03:55.170 --> 00:03:59.580
 any other live service that 

00:03:57.660 --> 00:04:04.370
 youtube here you can select the 

00:03:59.580 --> 00:04:06.379
 file path from the browse button io 

00:04:04.370 --> 00:04:09.080
 leaving the folders I have both done 

00:04:06.379 --> 00:04:12.680
 directly video because I don't feel like it 

00:04:09.080 --> 00:04:16.549
 to create a video folder instead 

00:04:12.680 --> 00:04:19.090
 we can choose the video adapter e 

00:04:16.549 --> 00:04:21.229
 I recommend the basic resolution 

00:04:19.090 --> 00:04:25.100
 personalized and put the one I have 

00:04:21.229 --> 00:04:27.229
 I reduced resolution no one 

00:04:25.100 --> 00:04:29.870
 otherwise there are problems and 

00:04:27.229 --> 00:04:30.979
 fps of advice 30 these are the 

00:04:29.870 --> 00:04:33.500
 standard that I recommend 

00:04:30.979 --> 00:04:34.310
 absolutely because how I am 

00:04:33.500 --> 00:04:36.710
 recording myself 

00:04:34.310 --> 00:04:38.389
 sorry again but the audio is 

00:04:36.710 --> 00:04:41.960
 recording in my room that a room 

00:04:38.389 --> 00:04:46.130
 a little small and there is a bit of a rumble goes 

00:04:41.960 --> 00:04:48.260
 more than fine in the audio category 

00:04:46.130 --> 00:04:49.880
 instead we can choose if the sounds 

00:04:48.260 --> 00:04:52.789
 we want to get them out of the speakers 

00:04:49.880 --> 00:04:54.919
 of the computer or not from some boxes you dare 

00:04:52.789 --> 00:04:57.320
 I use the microphone to record 

00:04:54.919 --> 00:04:59.300
 trans but the computer recognizes me 

00:04:57.320 --> 00:05:05.449
 like a realtech ag phishing microphone 

00:04:59.300 --> 00:05:07.100
 audio here are remote keys that I 

00:05:05.449 --> 00:05:09.020
 however I have no set up because I am a 

00:05:07.100 --> 00:05:11.570
 manual type in the sense I prefer e 

00:05:09.020 --> 00:05:13.639
 just press the start button 

00:05:11.570 --> 00:05:16.250
 recording rather than crushing a 

00:05:13.639 --> 00:05:17.570
 button and maybe more than maybe never understood 

00:05:16.250 --> 00:05:21.560
 with another program if you want 

00:05:17.570 --> 00:05:24.050
 put also the bulls tutor to put them 

00:05:21.560 --> 00:05:26.419
 before setting the board anymore 

00:05:24.050 --> 00:05:28.099
 taste dog 

00:05:26.419 --> 00:05:30.710
 here are the settings for 

00:05:28.099 --> 00:05:34.940
 broadcast the custu troop keys of 

00:05:30.710 --> 00:05:36.800
 protest in advanced I am not 

00:05:34.940 --> 00:05:39.699
 really how to help him and I'm sorry not 

00:05:36.800 --> 00:05:42.139
 I'm a scientific disseminator 

00:05:39.699 --> 00:05:43.340
 but these are the IT 

00:05:42.139 --> 00:05:45.380
 advanced settings 

00:05:43.340 --> 00:05:47.960
 if you are a geek of advice 

00:05:45.380 --> 00:05:50.060
 to give us a look because if really 

00:05:47.960 --> 00:05:53.240
 you can improve the performance of the 

00:05:50.060 --> 00:05:55.520
 video if not if you are people like 

00:05:53.240 --> 00:05:56.800
 leave me alone because it's all 

00:05:55.520 --> 00:05:58.789
 another thing 

00:05:56.800 --> 00:06:02.539
 on the other hand like the category 

00:05:58.789 --> 00:06:05.150
 quicksync encoder while this is it 

00:06:02.539 --> 00:06:07.970
 the microphone noise reduction tour 

00:06:05.150 --> 00:06:10.580
 now by doing this you can see that the 

00:06:07.970 --> 00:06:13.880
 Your microphone will have settings 

00:06:10.580 --> 00:06:15.830
 other than the pre-set ones there is not 

00:06:13.880 --> 00:06:16.720
 worry if you are like people 

00:06:15.830 --> 00:06:21.700
 me recording 

00:06:16.720 --> 00:06:23.290
 in a sounding hole I understand you use 

00:06:21.700 --> 00:06:25.480
 this study, however, for the time being no use 

00:06:23.290 --> 00:06:29.680
 because I'll show you a little 

00:06:25.480 --> 00:06:32.890
 software as well as the synth switch 

00:06:29.680 --> 00:06:34.540
 you can put transitions between one 

00:06:32.890 --> 00:06:36.610
 registration and the other I do not 

00:06:34.540 --> 00:06:38.920
 because as I told you, I'm doing it 

00:06:36.610 --> 00:06:40.480
 very short tutorial very simple 

00:06:38.920 --> 00:06:42.280
 very is it used if i did n't use gods 

00:06:40.480 --> 00:06:45.280
 specific technical terms 

00:06:42.280 --> 00:06:47.080
 I'm just not very good at using 

00:06:45.280 --> 00:06:49.630
 this type of recording software 

00:06:47.080 --> 00:06:52.120
 screen so I go a lot about 

00:06:49.630 --> 00:06:53.500
 default settings well I hope that 

00:06:52.120 --> 00:06:56.520
 this tutorial was there to help e 

00:06:53.500 --> 00:06:56.520
 to the next girl
