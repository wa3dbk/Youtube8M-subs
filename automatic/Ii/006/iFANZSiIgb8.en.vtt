cute absolutely and yeah this is the

00:01:51.249 --> 00:01:54.480 
cute absolutely and yeah this is the
cube<00:01:52.319> so<00:01:53.319> i'll<00:01:53.469> show<00:01:53.679> you<00:01:53.740> all<00:01:53.950> of<00:01:53.979> them<00:01:54.249> that<00:01:54.459> i

00:01:54.480 --> 00:01:54.490 
cube so i'll show you all of them that i

00:01:54.490 --> 00:02:01.609 
cube so i'll show you all of them that i
have<00:01:54.700> now<00:01:55.740> the<00:01:56.740> 40<00:01:57.130> to<00:01:57.279> 50<00:01:57.880> and<00:01:58.119> 55<00:01:58.689> millimeters

00:02:01.609 --> 00:02:01.619 

00:02:01.619 --> 00:02:04.999 

let's<00:02:02.619> see<00:02:02.799> if<00:02:02.859> the<00:02:03.039> 55<00:02:04.029> millimeters<00:02:04.509> is

00:02:04.999 --> 00:02:05.009 
let's see if the 55 millimeters is

00:02:05.009 --> 00:02:09.839 
let's see if the 55 millimeters is
actually<00:02:06.009> the<00:02:06.159> 55<00:02:07.020> this<00:02:08.020> is<00:02:08.259> a<00:02:08.440> ling<00:02:08.649> yan<00:02:08.920> ok

00:02:09.839 --> 00:02:09.849 
actually the 55 this is a ling yan ok

00:02:09.849 --> 00:02:13.620 
actually the 55 this is a ling yan ok
but<00:02:10.750> the<00:02:10.869> linnean<00:02:11.349> is<00:02:11.530> a<00:02:11.560> little<00:02:12.130> tad<00:02:12.520> tiny<00:02:13.390> bit

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:13.630 
but the linnean is a little tad tiny bit

00:02:13.630 --> 00:02:19.040 
but the linnean is a little tad tiny bit
bigger<00:02:13.920> like<00:02:15.090> let's<00:02:16.090> see<00:02:16.270> if<00:02:16.360> i<00:02:16.420> can<00:02:16.630> show<00:02:16.900> you

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:19.050 

00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:22.020 

see<00:02:20.050> the<00:02:20.200> linnean<00:02:20.500> is<00:02:20.650> right<00:02:20.800> here<00:02:21.010> it's<00:02:21.550> a<00:02:21.730> tad

00:02:22.020 --> 00:02:22.030 
see the linnean is right here it's a tad

00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:24.809 
see the linnean is right here it's a tad
bit<00:02:22.480> bigger<00:02:22.720> if<00:02:22.900> you<00:02:23.019> can<00:02:23.170> tell<00:02:23.580> tiny<00:02:24.580> bit

00:02:24.809 --> 00:02:24.819 
bit bigger if you can tell tiny bit

00:02:24.819 --> 00:02:30.509 
bit bigger if you can tell tiny bit
bigger<00:02:25.000> hard<00:02:25.690> to<00:02:25.810> tell<00:02:28.590> it<00:02:29.590> wit<00:02:30.040> to<00:02:30.280> is<00:02:30.489> a

00:02:30.509 --> 00:02:30.519 
bigger hard to tell it wit to is a

00:02:30.519 --> 00:02:33.720 
bigger hard to tell it wit to is a
little<00:02:31.090> bit<00:02:31.269> tiny<00:02:32.019> bit<00:02:32.200> bigger<00:02:32.410> than<00:02:33.069> a<00:02:33.129> 50

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:33.730 
little bit tiny bit bigger than a 50

00:02:33.730 --> 00:02:43.650 
little bit tiny bit bigger than a 50
millimeter<00:02:36.870> and<00:02:39.209> the<00:02:40.349> smallest<00:02:41.349> one<00:02:41.590> the<00:02:42.660> 42

00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:43.660 
millimeter and the smallest one the 42

00:02:43.660 --> 00:02:45.839 
millimeter and the smallest one the 42
is<00:02:43.900> actually<00:02:44.380> smaller<00:02:44.440> than<00:02:44.920> a<00:02:45.130> mini<00:02:45.459> Diane

00:02:45.839 --> 00:02:45.849 
is actually smaller than a mini Diane

00:02:45.849 --> 00:02:49.470 
is actually smaller than a mini Diane
Chang<00:02:47.250> the<00:02:48.250> invention<00:02:49.000> was<00:02:49.239> with<00:02:49.420> the

00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:49.480 
Chang the invention was with the

00:02:49.480 --> 00:02:51.300 
Chang the invention was with the
smallest<00:02:49.810> Cuba<00:02:50.110> half<00:02:50.260> but<00:02:50.590> now<00:02:50.769> it's<00:02:50.950> no

00:02:51.300 --> 00:02:51.310 
smallest Cuba half but now it's no

00:02:51.310 --> 00:02:53.220 
smallest Cuba half but now it's no
longer<00:02:51.519> the<00:02:51.760> smallest<00:02:52.060> cube<00:02:52.269> his<00:02:52.810> musky

00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:53.230 
longer the smallest cube his musky

00:02:53.230 --> 00:03:07.910 
longer the smallest cube his musky
behalf<00:02:53.500> is<00:02:53.709> the<00:02:54.840> 42<00:02:55.840> millimeter

00:03:07.910 --> 00:03:07.920 

00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:13.649 

probably<00:03:08.920> for<00:03:09.159> one<00:03:09.340> hand<00:03:09.610> I<00:03:10.170> I<00:03:12.330> think<00:03:13.330> I<00:03:13.540> just

00:03:13.649 --> 00:03:13.659 
probably for one hand I I think I just

00:03:13.659 --> 00:03:20.970 
probably for one hand I I think I just
may<00:03:14.170> use<00:03:14.409> I<00:03:17.010> don't<00:03:18.010> know<00:03:18.129> yet<00:03:19.769> I'm<00:03:20.769> not<00:03:20.920> sure

00:03:20.970 --> 00:03:20.980 
may use I don't know yet I'm not sure

00:03:20.980 --> 00:03:26.630 
may use I don't know yet I'm not sure
yet<00:03:21.340> I<00:03:21.810> might<00:03:22.810> just<00:03:23.110> use<00:03:23.769> the<00:03:24.750> 50<00:03:25.750> millimeters

00:03:26.630 --> 00:03:26.640 
yet I might just use the 50 millimeters

00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:31.380 
yet I might just use the 50 millimeters
the<00:03:27.640> 42<00:03:28.090> is<00:03:28.150> too<00:03:28.390> small<00:03:28.690> right<00:03:28.989> now<00:03:30.060> but<00:03:31.060> who

00:03:31.380 --> 00:03:31.390 
the 42 is too small right now but who

00:03:31.390 --> 00:03:33.780 
the 42 is too small right now but who
knows<00:03:31.739> with<00:03:32.739> some<00:03:33.040> practice<00:03:33.220> I'll<00:03:33.609> just

00:03:33.780 --> 00:03:33.790 
knows with some practice I'll just

00:03:33.790 --> 00:03:38.880 
knows with some practice I'll just
decide<00:03:36.180> so<00:03:37.180> yeah<00:03:37.420> these<00:03:37.750> I<00:03:37.810> have<00:03:38.410> all<00:03:38.590> of<00:03:38.620> them

00:03:38.880 --> 00:03:38.890 
decide so yeah these I have all of them

00:03:38.890 --> 00:03:43.530 
decide so yeah these I have all of them
and<00:03:39.269> that<00:03:40.269> is<00:03:40.450> pretty<00:03:40.930> awesome<00:03:42.420> thank<00:03:43.420> you
