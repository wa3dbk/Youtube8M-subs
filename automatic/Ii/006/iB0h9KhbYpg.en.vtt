 the competition b 

00:00:50.470 --> 00:00:52.130
 I want to say 

00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:55.980
 at the moment when there is only the voice one sat down good foot 

00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:57.790
 deceased 

00:00:57.790 --> 00:01:00.780
 on the other side of Toulouse we have a lot of the title that will start 

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:02.900
 now 

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:05.360
 for health it is the site 

00:01:05.360 --> 00:01:08.000
 preferably without words 

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:09.630
 it allows to 

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:12.860
 it helps to be clearer 

00:01:12.860 --> 00:01:17.160

00:01:30.470 --> 00:01:31.820
 campus 

00:01:31.820 --> 00:01:34.420
 so the process of the busy 

00:01:34.420 --> 00:01:37.420
 in the middle it will take the cd 

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:41.530
