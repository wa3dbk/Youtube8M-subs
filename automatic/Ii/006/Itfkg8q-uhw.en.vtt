all<00:00:01.140> right<00:00:01.290> so<00:00:01.500> here<00:00:01.800> is<00:00:01.829> a<00:00:01.979> test<00:00:02.460> with<00:00:02.730> a

00:00:02.750 --> 00:00:02.760 
all right so here is a test with a

00:00:02.760 --> 00:00:04.760 
all right so here is a test with a
series<00:00:03.360> of<00:00:03.389> radar<00:00:03.750> detectors<00:00:03.870> against<00:00:04.650> the

00:00:04.760 --> 00:00:04.770 
series of radar detectors against the

changing that feature so let's take a

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:45.049 
changing that feature so let's take a
look<00:00:41.360> versus<00:00:42.360> a<00:00:42.540> custom<00:00:43.200> Falcon<00:00:43.739> each<00:00:43.950> our<00:00:44.219> low

00:04:18.920 --> 00:04:18.930 
red line Falcon er so as you guys can

00:04:18.930 --> 00:04:20.120 
red line Falcon er so as you guys can
see<00:04:19.140> there<00:04:19.290> definitely<00:04:19.470> are<00:04:19.890> some

00:04:20.120 --> 00:04:20.130 
see there definitely are some

00:04:20.130 --> 00:04:21.440 
see there definitely are some
differences<00:04:20.549> between<00:04:20.609> the<00:04:21.030> different

00:04:21.440 --> 00:04:21.450

detectors and turning the filters on and

00:04:23.850 --> 00:04:25.130 
detectors and turning the filters on and
off<00:04:23.940> does<00:04:24.240> seem<00:04:24.480> to<00:04:24.630> impact<00:04:24.960> performance

00:04:25.130 --> 00:04:25.140 
off does seem to impact performance

00:04:25.140 --> 00:04:27.890 
off does seem to impact performance
somewhat<00:04:25.770> it<00:04:26.700> is<00:04:26.790> pretty<00:04:27.030> cool<00:04:27.240> fortunately

00:04:27.890 --> 00:04:27.900 
somewhat it is pretty cool fortunately

00:04:27.900 --> 00:04:30.140 
somewhat it is pretty cool fortunately
in<00:04:28.290> this<00:04:28.530> test<00:04:28.800> on<00:04:29.040> this<00:04:29.250> particular<00:04:29.850> course

00:04:30.140 --> 00:04:30.150 
in this test on this particular course

00:04:30.150 --> 00:04:32.600 
in this test on this particular course
even<00:04:30.540> if<00:04:30.630> you<00:04:30.690> have<00:04:30.870> TMF<00:04:31.350> 40's<00:04:31.890> are<00:04:32.070> engaged

00:04:32.600 --> 00:04:32.610 
even if you have TMF 40's are engaged

00:04:32.610 --> 00:04:35.480 
even if you have TMF 40's are engaged
you<00:04:33.060> still<00:04:33.420> do<00:04:33.630> get<00:04:33.810> sufficient<00:04:34.280> warning<00:04:35.280> time

00:04:35.480 --> 00:04:35.490 
you still do get sufficient warning time

00:04:35.490 --> 00:04:37.460 
you still do get sufficient warning time
to<00:04:35.640> slow<00:04:35.850> down<00:04:35.880> against<00:04:36.690> a<00:04:36.900> constant<00:04:37.260> on

00:04:37.460 --> 00:04:37.470 
to slow down against a constant on

00:04:37.470 --> 00:04:40.460 
to slow down against a constant on
source<00:04:37.770> like<00:04:38.010> this<00:04:39.080> those<00:04:40.080> of<00:04:40.110> you<00:04:40.230> guys<00:04:40.320> who

00:04:40.460 --> 00:04:40.470 
source like this those of you guys who

00:04:40.470 --> 00:04:42.800 
source like this those of you guys who
aren't<00:04:40.620> familiar<00:04:40.740> TSR<00:04:41.730> and<00:04:41.880> TMF<00:04:42.270> they're

00:04:42.800 --> 00:04:42.810 
aren't familiar TSR and TMF they're

00:04:42.810 --> 00:04:44.870 
aren't familiar TSR and TMF they're
basically<00:04:43.140> filters<00:04:43.590> initially<00:04:44.340> created<00:04:44.730> to

00:04:44.870 --> 00:04:44.880 
basically filters initially created to

00:04:44.880 --> 00:04:46.760 
basically filters initially created to
help<00:04:45.120> filter<00:04:45.420> out<00:04:45.540> these<00:04:45.870> traffic<00:04:46.380> monitoring

00:04:46.760 --> 00:04:46.770 
help filter out these traffic monitoring

00:04:46.770 --> 00:04:49.130 
help filter out these traffic monitoring
filters<00:04:47.220> on<00:04:47.370> the<00:04:47.730> highway<00:04:48.060> but<00:04:48.750> it<00:04:48.870> turns<00:04:49.050> out

00:04:49.130 --> 00:04:49.140 
filters on the highway but it turns out

00:04:49.140 --> 00:04:50.650 
filters on the highway but it turns out
they're<00:04:49.350> really<00:04:49.440> useful<00:04:49.650> for<00:04:49.980> filtering<00:04:50.340> out

00:04:50.650 --> 00:04:50.660 
they're really useful for filtering out

00:04:50.660 --> 00:04:52.910 
they're really useful for filtering out
cars<00:04:51.660> with<00:04:51.870> those<00:04:52.020> blind<00:04:52.290> spot<00:04:52.560> monitoring

00:04:52.910 --> 00:04:52.920 
cars with those blind spot monitoring

00:04:52.920 --> 00:04:54.200 
cars with those blind spot monitoring
systems<00:04:53.400> and<00:04:53.550> so<00:04:53.610> a<00:04:53.640> lot<00:04:53.820> of<00:04:53.850> people<00:04:54.090> actually

00:04:54.200 --> 00:04:54.210 
systems and so a lot of people actually

00:04:54.210 --> 00:04:56.180 
systems and so a lot of people actually
now<00:04:54.510> use<00:04:54.780> these<00:04:54.990> filters<00:04:55.230> specifically<00:04:56.070> to

00:04:56.180 --> 00:04:56.190 
now use these filters specifically to

00:04:56.190 --> 00:04:59.210 
now use these filters specifically to
deal<00:04:56.370> with<00:04:56.610> blind<00:04:57.390> spot<00:04:57.630> falses<00:04:58.050> there<00:04:58.830> is<00:04:58.950> you

00:04:59.210 --> 00:04:59.220 
deal with blind spot falses there is you

00:04:59.220 --> 00:05:00.440 
deal with blind spot falses there is you
know<00:04:59.250> a<00:04:59.340> little<00:04:59.580> bit<00:04:59.790> of<00:04:59.880> a<00:04:59.970> performance

00:05:00.440 --> 00:05:00.450 
know a little bit of a performance

00:05:00.450 --> 00:05:01.730 
know a little bit of a performance
penalty<00:05:00.570> and<00:05:00.870> you<00:05:00.930> can<00:05:01.110> see<00:05:01.260> that<00:05:01.440> here<00:05:01.620> in

00:05:01.730 --> 00:05:01.740 
penalty and you can see that here in

00:05:01.740 --> 00:05:04.460 
penalty and you can see that here in
this<00:05:01.890> test<00:05:02.100> in<00:05:02.850> terms<00:05:03.270> of<00:05:03.540> the<00:05:03.750> best<00:05:04.080> detection

00:05:04.460 --> 00:05:04.470 
this test in terms of the best detection

00:05:04.470 --> 00:05:06.620 
this test in terms of the best detection
in<00:05:04.830> this<00:05:05.400> case<00:05:05.700> the<00:05:05.940> best<00:05:06.090> route<00:05:06.330> actually

00:05:06.620 --> 00:05:06.630 
in this case the best route actually

00:05:06.630 --> 00:05:08.420 
in this case the best route actually
came<00:05:06.810> from<00:05:06.840> one<00:05:07.410> of<00:05:07.710> the<00:05:07.770> newer<00:05:07.919> view<00:05:08.220> ones

00:05:08.420 --> 00:05:08.430 
came from one of the newer view ones

00:05:08.430 --> 00:05:09.200 
came from one of the newer view ones
actually

00:05:09.200 --> 00:05:09.210 
actually

00:05:09.210 --> 00:05:11.330 
actually
outclassing<00:05:09.930> the<00:05:10.080> red<00:05:10.350> line<00:05:10.530> which<00:05:11.190> was

00:05:11.330 --> 00:05:11.340 
outclassing the red line which was

00:05:11.340 --> 00:05:12.800 
outclassing the red line which was
pretty<00:05:11.610> interesting<00:05:12.030> ran<00:05:12.390> the<00:05:12.480> red<00:05:12.630> line

00:05:12.800 --> 00:05:12.810 
pretty interesting ran the red line

00:05:12.810 --> 00:05:14.210 
pretty interesting ran the red line
actually<00:05:13.140> twice<00:05:13.350> and<00:05:13.620> that<00:05:13.680> was<00:05:13.740> the<00:05:14.010> better

00:05:14.210 --> 00:05:14.220 
actually twice and that was the better

00:05:14.220 --> 00:05:16.690 
actually twice and that was the better
run<00:05:14.490> of<00:05:14.669> the<00:05:14.790> two<00:05:14.970> with<00:05:15.210> TSR<00:05:15.840> turned<00:05:16.080> off<00:05:16.230> so

00:05:16.690 --> 00:05:16.700 
run of the two with TSR turned off so

00:05:16.700 --> 00:05:18.670 
run of the two with TSR turned off so
yeah<00:05:17.700> interesting

00:05:18.670 --> 00:05:18.680 
yeah interesting

00:05:18.680 --> 00:05:21.320 
yeah interesting
there<00:05:19.680> you<00:05:19.770> go<00:05:19.919> so<00:05:20.280> there's<00:05:20.520> a<00:05:20.610> look<00:05:20.820> with<00:05:21.120> a

00:05:21.320 --> 00:05:21.330 
there you go so there's a look with a

00:05:21.330 --> 00:05:23.510 
there you go so there's a look with a
k-band<00:05:21.840> source<00:05:22.200> say<00:05:22.620> relatively<00:05:23.340> difficult

00:05:23.510 --> 00:05:23.520 
k-band source say relatively difficult

00:05:23.520 --> 00:05:25.790 
k-band source say relatively difficult
one<00:05:23.910> to<00:05:23.940> detect<00:05:24.390> with<00:05:24.630> a<00:05:24.840> whole<00:05:25.110> variety<00:05:25.410> of

00:05:25.790 --> 00:05:25.800 
one to detect with a whole variety of

00:05:25.800 --> 00:05:28.430 
one to detect with a whole variety of
detectors<00:05:26.690> against<00:05:27.690> the<00:05:27.810> well<00:05:28.110> I<00:05:28.230> know<00:05:28.350> you

00:05:28.430 --> 00:05:28.440 
detectors against the well I know you

00:05:28.440 --> 00:05:29.510 
detectors against the well I know you
guys<00:05:28.560> heard<00:05:28.710> it<00:05:28.860> a<00:05:28.919> bunch<00:05:29.070> of<00:05:29.130> times<00:05:29.310> in<00:05:29.430> the

00:05:29.510 --> 00:05:29.520 
guys heard it a bunch of times in the

00:05:29.520 --> 00:05:33.409 
guys heard it a bunch of times in the
video<00:05:29.730> the<00:05:30.110> Falcon<00:05:31.110> HR<00:05:31.470> so<00:05:32.010> cool<00:05:32.850> thanks<00:05:33.300> for

00:05:33.409 --> 00:05:33.419 
video the Falcon HR so cool thanks for

00:05:33.419 --> 00:05:35.690 
video the Falcon HR so cool thanks for
watching
