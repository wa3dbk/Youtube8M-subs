men<00:01:07.610> and<00:01:07.909> women<00:01:08.030> who<00:01:08.330> grew<00:01:08.540> up<00:01:08.720> in<00:01:08.869> the<00:01:08.990> south

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:10.210 
men and women who grew up in the south

00:01:10.210 --> 00:01:13.330 
men and women who grew up in the south
when<00:01:11.210> segregation<00:01:12.020> was<00:01:12.590> still<00:01:12.649> taking<00:01:13.220> place

00:01:13.330 --> 00:01:13.340 
when segregation was still taking place

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:17.499 
when segregation was still taking place
when<00:01:14.800> you<00:01:15.800> know<00:01:15.890> the<00:01:16.039> transformations<00:01:16.910> that

00:01:17.499 --> 00:01:17.509 
when you know the transformations that

00:01:17.509 --> 00:01:20.050 
when you know the transformations that
are<00:01:18.140> still<00:01:18.470> incomplete<00:01:18.740> but<00:01:19.220> at<00:01:19.580> least<00:01:19.880> have

00:01:20.050 --> 00:01:20.060 
are still incomplete but at least have

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:23.830 
are still incomplete but at least have
begun<00:01:20.360> had<00:01:21.050> not<00:01:21.229> yet<00:01:21.440> begun<00:01:21.700> and<00:01:22.700> to<00:01:22.970> see<00:01:23.179> that

00:01:23.830 --> 00:01:23.840 
begun had not yet begun and to see that

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:27.100 
begun had not yet begun and to see that
transformation<00:01:24.490> in<00:01:25.490> their<00:01:25.820> own<00:01:25.970> lives<00:01:26.780> I

00:01:27.100 --> 00:01:27.110 
transformation in their own lives I

00:01:27.110 --> 00:01:30.669 
transformation in their own lives I
think<00:01:27.470> that<00:01:27.649> is<00:01:27.800> powerful<00:01:28.240> and<00:01:29.240> it<00:01:29.960> is<00:01:30.229> hopeful

00:01:30.669 --> 00:01:30.679 
think that is powerful and it is hopeful

00:01:30.679 --> 00:01:33.490 
think that is powerful and it is hopeful
because<00:01:31.520> what<00:01:31.670> it<00:01:31.759> indicates<00:01:32.030> is<00:01:32.450> that<00:01:32.500> people

00:01:33.490 --> 00:01:33.500 
because what it indicates is that people

00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:35.980 
because what it indicates is that people
can<00:01:33.679> change<00:01:33.979> and<00:01:34.850> each<00:01:35.330> successive

00:01:35.980 --> 00:01:35.990 
can change and each successive

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:40.690 
can change and each successive
generation<00:01:36.580> can<00:01:38.649> you<00:01:39.649> know<00:01:39.710> create<00:01:40.100> a

00:01:40.690 --> 00:01:40.700 
generation can you know create a

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:43.899 
generation can you know create a
different<00:01:41.420> vision<00:01:41.600> of<00:01:41.869> how<00:01:42.159> you<00:01:43.159> know<00:01:43.250> we<00:01:43.520> have

00:01:43.899 --> 00:01:43.909 
different vision of how you know we have

00:01:43.909 --> 00:01:45.730 
different vision of how you know we have
to<00:01:44.090> treat<00:01:44.300> each<00:01:44.450> other<00:01:44.600> and<00:01:44.899> I<00:01:45.289> think<00:01:45.319> Bill

00:01:45.730 --> 00:01:45.740 
to treat each other and I think Bill

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:47.249 
to treat each other and I think Bill
Clinton<00:01:45.770> embodies<00:01:46.429> that<00:01:46.460> I<00:01:46.670> think<00:01:47.030> he

00:01:47.249 --> 00:01:47.259 
Clinton embodies that I think he

00:01:47.259 --> 00:01:49.870 
Clinton embodies that I think he
deserves<00:01:48.259> credit<00:01:48.380> for<00:01:48.799> that<00:01:48.950> now<00:01:49.189> I<00:01:49.460> haven't

00:01:49.870 --> 00:01:49.880 
deserves credit for that now I haven't
