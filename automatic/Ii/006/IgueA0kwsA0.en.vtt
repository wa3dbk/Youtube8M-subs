00:05:31.290 --> 00:05:31.300 
especially obviously if you have

00:05:31.300 --> 00:05:33.690 
especially obviously if you have
thinning<00:05:31.540> brows<00:05:31.840> um<00:05:32.200> so<00:05:33.190> just<00:05:33.220> what<00:05:33.520> we<00:05:33.580> want

00:05:33.690 --> 00:05:33.700 
thinning brows um so just what we want

00:05:33.700 --> 00:05:35.520 
thinning brows um so just what we want
to<00:05:33.820> do<00:05:33.940> is<00:05:34.060> take<00:05:34.240> a<00:05:34.300> small<00:05:34.630> eyeshadow<00:05:34.810> brush<00:05:35.350> I

00:05:35.520 --> 00:05:35.530 
to do is take a small eyeshadow brush I

00:05:35.530 --> 00:05:37.350 
to do is take a small eyeshadow brush I
would<00:05:35.770> recommend<00:05:36.310> I<00:05:36.610> shadow<00:05:36.910> because<00:05:37.090> it's

00:05:37.350 --> 00:05:37.360 
would recommend I shadow because it's

00:05:37.360 --> 00:05:39.110 
would recommend I shadow because it's
going<00:05:37.450> to<00:05:37.540> make<00:05:37.630> it<00:05:37.780> look<00:05:37.870> a<00:05:37.960> lot<00:05:38.380> more<00:05:38.440> natural

00:05:39.110 --> 00:05:39.120 
going to make it look a lot more natural

00:05:39.120 --> 00:05:42.030 
going to make it look a lot more natural
so<00:05:40.120> what<00:05:40.240> you<00:05:40.330> want<00:05:40.450> to<00:05:40.540> do<00:05:40.630> is<00:05:40.780> just<00:05:41.040> really

00:05:42.030 --> 00:05:42.040 
so what you want to do is just really

00:05:42.040 --> 00:05:45.780 
so what you want to do is just really
start<00:05:42.400> with<00:05:42.610> a<00:05:42.640> small<00:05:43.090> application<00:05:44.790> just

00:05:45.780 --> 00:05:45.790 
start with a small application just

00:05:45.790 --> 00:05:47.400 
start with a small application just
extending<00:05:46.420> the<00:05:46.510> brow<00:05:46.750> you<00:05:47.080> don't<00:05:47.230> want<00:05:47.350> to

00:05:47.400 --> 00:05:47.410 
extending the brow you don't want to

00:05:47.410 --> 00:05:49.530 
extending the brow you don't want to
fill<00:05:47.620> in<00:05:47.800> where<00:05:48.070> every<00:05:48.520> single<00:05:48.880> hair<00:05:49.120> is<00:05:49.330> you

00:05:49.530 --> 00:05:49.540 
fill in where every single hair is you

00:05:49.540 --> 00:05:51.150 
fill in where every single hair is you
just<00:05:49.720> want<00:05:49.900> to<00:05:49.930> kind<00:05:50.140> of<00:05:50.200> make<00:05:50.350> a<00:05:50.380> nice<00:05:50.680> shape

00:05:51.150 --> 00:05:51.160 
just want to kind of make a nice shape

00:05:51.160 --> 00:05:55.950 
just want to kind of make a nice shape
there<00:05:51.460> so<00:05:52.420> just<00:05:52.630> like<00:05:52.780> that<00:05:53.700> and<00:05:54.780> it<00:05:55.780> will

00:05:55.950 --> 00:05:55.960 
there so just like that and it will

00:05:55.960 --> 00:05:57.570 
there so just like that and it will
probably<00:05:56.410> look<00:05:56.560> a<00:05:56.680> little<00:05:56.920> strange<00:05:57.310> at<00:05:57.520> first

00:05:57.570 --> 00:05:57.580 
probably look a little strange at first

00:05:57.580 --> 00:05:59.370 
probably look a little strange at first
because<00:05:57.940> you're<00:05:58.180> not<00:05:58.270> used<00:05:58.540> to<00:05:58.660> having<00:05:58.930> so

00:05:59.370 --> 00:05:59.380 
because you're not used to having so

00:05:59.380 --> 00:06:01.680 
because you're not used to having so
much<00:05:59.560> eyebrow<00:06:00.010> but<00:06:00.370> it<00:06:00.610> trust<00:06:01.150> me<00:06:01.330> it<00:06:01.450> looks

00:06:01.680 --> 00:06:01.690 
much eyebrow but it trust me it looks

00:06:01.690 --> 00:06:03.540 
much eyebrow but it trust me it looks
fine<00:06:01.930> in<00:06:01.990> my<00:06:02.350> opinion<00:06:02.680> it<00:06:02.920> looks<00:06:03.100> completely

00:06:03.540 --> 00:06:03.550 
fine in my opinion it looks completely

00:06:03.550 --> 00:06:07.560 
fine in my opinion it looks completely
natural<00:06:05.730> so<00:06:06.730> I'm<00:06:06.820> just<00:06:06.970> doing<00:06:07.180> that<00:06:07.270> on<00:06:07.420> the

00:06:07.560 --> 00:06:07.570
