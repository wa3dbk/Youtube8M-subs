00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.509
 no not expecting a great match in 

00:00:03.720 --> 00:00:10.920
 trains you're also worried about 

00:00:06.509 --> 00:00:14.660
 your week party and already this selection 

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:14.660
 is from tena or chef 

00:00:15.199 --> 00:00:21.300
 until today's first game 

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:24.360
 Let's say formally that you have the selection 

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:26.580
 sub-23 around the preparation that 

00:00:24.360 --> 00:00:28.919
 has to be doing for the 

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:30.990
 carso pre-Olympic that will be three 

00:00:28.919 --> 00:00:33.480
 matches in carson and afterwards it will be if in 

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:36.510
 if the semifinals pass the 

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:38.820
 French city 4 in the table tie against 

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:41.520
 the team of enesa a well-known guy 

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:44.489
 of us and that later in the end 

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:46.829
 was the opponent that can give him a fight 

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:48.420
 rather more extensive and in which 

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:50.190
 they were the party they report 

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:51.390
 certain things not because what was 

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:53.429
 very lost javier protest of the first 

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:55.350
 weather 

00:00:53.429 --> 00:00:58.579
 but that it was very lost that he was 

00:00:55.350 --> 00:01:01.380
 that there was like slip where there was a 

00:00:58.579 --> 00:01:04.260
 good communication 

00:01:01.380 --> 00:01:05.700
 I'm a suitable rhythm that is logical 

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:08.160
 is in cash for very little 

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:09.090
 time and the important thing will be to win in 

00:01:08.160 --> 00:01:11.220
 important that I have to go grabbing 

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:13.920
 pace now in the elections that 

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:16.170
 judge it in the pre-Olympic and this 

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:19.110
 selection you have to judge it when you go to 

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:20.670
 london and when in london for the 

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:22.440
 faction objectives I left football 

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:24.420
 to win a medal if he does not win a medal 

00:01:22.440 --> 00:01:25.710
 be a failure because they are the objectives 

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:38.490
 that they have put on not only that they 

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:40.170
 they said of city â€‹â€‹to get together for 

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:43.320
 where these parties can not be a 

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:45.840
 balance not a balance to criticize and 

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:47.280
 to have a main objective I am 

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:49.560
 agree as just to get us a 

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:51.300
 seeing exactly known there will be a 

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:54.110
 extra preparation no longer record against 

00:01:51.300 --> 00:01:57.650
 senegal san francisco 

00:01:54.110 --> 00:02:00.830
 they are things that have been decided by room 

00:01:57.650 --> 00:02:03.700
 naughty thinking about a possible rival 

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:03.700
 applying in london 

00:02:05.110 --> 00:02:09.700
 forward optimist 

00:02:14.020 --> 00:02:18.470
 if you're not thinking if you're not 

00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:23.150
 thinking the medal goal the 

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:25.810
 plan store to classify and against 

00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:28.670
 belgium and against holland and against 

00:02:25.810 --> 00:02:33.640
 Germans and against Timbuktu but right now 

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:33.640
 the rivals are from the concacaf by god 

00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:51.680
 and of course if you decide to go with senegal me 

00:02:47.010 --> 00:03:03.510
 I think the delivery the distribution is 

00:02:51.680 --> 00:03:07.550
 different stronger than when it came to 

00:03:03.510 --> 00:03:10.379
 I think the theme also seems to me 

00:03:07.550 --> 00:03:13.639
 [Music] 

00:03:10.379 --> 00:03:13.639
 I would have permission from your team 

00:03:14.069 --> 00:03:19.379
 fernando had in the conference of 

00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:22.159
 press said there is no application yet 

00:03:19.379 --> 00:03:22.159
 by this player 

00:03:25.970 --> 00:03:32.629
 [Music] 

00:03:27.950 --> 00:03:37.349
 also but they have not done it 

00:03:32.629 --> 00:03:39.090
 according to the instructions from the rostrum 

00:03:37.349 --> 00:03:43.069
 they answered to inform because they are 

00:03:39.090 --> 00:03:47.299
 negotiating if the truth is used 

00:03:43.069 --> 00:03:49.670
 is the reality of being negotiating for 

00:03:47.299 --> 00:03:51.859
 what he wants in his team the 

00:03:49.670 --> 00:03:52.790
 reality or what one expects from 

00:03:51.859 --> 00:03:55.129
 technical director of the selection 

00:03:52.790 --> 00:03:58.969
 national is that at least he chooses 

00:03:55.129 --> 00:04:00.439
 23 good 21 to get declared the 

00:03:58.969 --> 00:04:02.150
 head of the national teams is 

00:04:00.439 --> 00:04:04.470
 Joseph called those of corruption who 

00:04:02.150 --> 00:04:09.500
 loses the one that does not pass 

00:04:04.470 --> 00:04:09.500
 then it may be minimal that they play 

00:04:14.510 --> 00:04:20.130
 Sanchez made a fool of himself can not be 

00:04:17.640 --> 00:04:23.630
 with only two players there is a same 

00:04:20.130 --> 00:04:35.190
 the players and hugo sanchez 

00:04:23.630 --> 00:04:38.910
 this character things of the entity because it is 

00:04:35.190 --> 00:04:42.030
 other friends in training the 

00:04:38.910 --> 00:04:44.340
 Mexican national team sub 23 before 

00:04:42.030 --> 00:04:45.930
 of the prolific and during the prolific and 

00:04:44.340 --> 00:04:48.660
 I knew it 's perfectly like salt if you do not 

00:04:45.930 --> 00:04:51.240
 I was doing your hollow shipping 

00:04:48.660 --> 00:04:53.370
 them little basins and their two and their 

00:04:51.240 --> 00:04:55.560
 and showing that the means of 

00:04:53.370 --> 00:04:59.220
 communication and did not direct the team 

00:04:55.560 --> 00:05:01.760
 he took it seriously we agree but 

00:04:59.220 --> 00:05:01.760
 that in the end 

00:05:06.740 --> 00:05:11.090
 not that match in the whole tournament 

00:05:16.610 --> 00:05:19.729
 seven goals 

00:05:26.080 --> 00:05:33.740
 if you are going to lose the position if you fail and 

00:05:29.750 --> 00:05:36.320
 direct them 

00:05:33.740 --> 00:05:41.840
 already if I'm getting here as the 

00:05:36.320 --> 00:05:44.660
 elche bulletproof vest for 

00:05:41.840 --> 00:05:49.180
 elections is to seek to pass first of 

00:05:44.660 --> 00:05:49.180
 group what has to happen the second and 

00:05:52.360 --> 00:06:03.640
 must be and hugo sanchez marquez and here 

00:06:00.740 --> 00:06:03.640
 yes there is a failure 

00:06:10.780 --> 00:06:15.190
 that can cost you the sheet 

00:06:20.500 --> 00:06:26.030
 although he directs the chepo his principle the 

00:06:22.790 --> 00:06:29.120
 background have the option to and is the one that's going to 

00:06:26.030 --> 00:06:30.050
 costar directs what your website continues with its 

00:06:29.120 --> 00:06:33.470
 three lines 

00:06:30.050 --> 00:06:36.590
 it seems to me that he has to go to the 

00:06:33.470 --> 00:06:40.909
 Olympians without any problem country go 

00:06:36.590 --> 00:06:43.099
 walking and I would have to get to the 

00:06:40.909 --> 00:06:44.060
 penthouses to fight for the truths as 

00:06:43.099 --> 00:06:47.389
 says let's teach 

00:06:44.060 --> 00:06:51.650
 there is already a different analysis and I've already 

00:06:47.389 --> 00:06:54.979
 said does not depend on the group nor does it depend on 

00:06:51.650 --> 00:06:57.080
 nothing depends on what is the largest Swiss 

00:06:54.979 --> 00:06:59.349
 generation of young talents in the 

00:06:57.080 --> 00:06:59.349
 world 

00:07:02.440 --> 00:07:07.790
 Spain is a broom that said Spain 

00:07:05.629 --> 00:07:14.160
 Great Britain unit 

00:07:07.790 --> 00:07:18.330
 was england wales and ireland go 

00:07:14.160 --> 00:07:21.729
 this argentinian brazil uruguay are missing 

00:07:18.330 --> 00:07:24.539
 some more of those whom you want 

00:07:21.729 --> 00:07:24.539
 and we returned
