00:00:08.309 --> 00:00:12.730
 I have a farm of three hectares 

00:00:10.870 --> 00:00:15.099
 it exists since 2005 but 

00:00:12.730 --> 00:00:19.869
 historically we are sure that light 

00:00:15.099 --> 00:00:22.300
 since at least 1878 I was born in 

00:00:19.869 --> 00:00:24.160
 eternal my father is french 

00:00:22.300 --> 00:00:26.830
 so he is the one who has the vineyard 

00:00:24.160 --> 00:00:29.020
 champenois but beside my mom and 

00:00:26.830 --> 00:00:32.280
 Filipino departure she was 

00:00:29.020 --> 00:00:37.150
 farmer so rather ridiculous trice 

00:00:32.280 --> 00:00:40.120
 to the philippines thanks to that I managed to 

00:00:37.150 --> 00:00:42.130
 to make a mixture of cultures and to be 

00:00:40.120 --> 00:00:44.860
 I took over two years ago 

00:00:42.130 --> 00:00:46.390
 exactly with my dad my uncle and 

00:00:44.860 --> 00:00:47.350
 my friend in the house was built 

00:00:46.390 --> 00:00:49.000
 19th 

00:00:47.350 --> 00:00:52.629
 it is an old farmhouse party 

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:55.870
 and it's been turned into exploitation 

00:00:52.629 --> 00:00:59.320
 wine since at least 1900 45 

00:00:55.870 --> 00:01:02.079
 I really like everything on the side 

00:00:59.320 --> 00:01:04.210
 is it's champagne up to 

00:01:02.079 --> 00:01:07.630
 languedoc roussillon let's say I do not 

00:01:04.210 --> 00:01:09.610
 not denigrate neither the Loire nor the Alsace nor 

00:01:07.630 --> 00:01:12.430
 the bordeaux it's just that I am 

00:01:09.610 --> 00:01:13.930
 fell in love with Burgundy 

00:01:12.430 --> 00:01:17.020
 coast of the rhÃ´ne and languedoc 

00:01:13.930 --> 00:01:20.100
 roussillon I have long been a long time 

00:01:17.020 --> 00:01:21.810
 hesitated to be a winemaker because 

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:23.790
 I said to myself I'm a woman 

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:26.400
 a world of men my parents have not me 

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:31.259
 necessarily pushed to go in the vineyards 

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:34.200
 to work with them and in 2005 we have 

00:01:31.259 --> 00:01:35.460
 started telling me now they tell you 

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:39.330
 that it's for you 

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:41.690
 so I agreed to take over 

00:01:39.330 --> 00:01:44.100
 little by little and doing the masseur 

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:44.600
 of the oiv is so by doing my turn the 

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:46.619
 world 

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:48.720
 I realized that it was 

00:01:46.619 --> 00:01:50.190
 really an interesting job one can 

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:50.580
 do everything we do not have time to 

00:01:50.190 --> 00:01:52.319
 to be bored 

00:01:50.580 --> 00:01:54.509
 we really harvest the fruit of our 

00:01:52.319 --> 00:01:56.850
 work does literally especially with 

00:01:54.509 --> 00:01:59.130
 the material that we have today a 

00:01:56.850 --> 00:02:01.020
 woman can work very easily 

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:02.450
 in the vineyards and next I like 

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:06.800
 a lot also the administrative work 

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:08.930
 and I love to call people 

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:11.900
 call the wine shops the restaurateurs 

00:02:08.930 --> 00:02:13.460
 importers etc 

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:16.250
 I would like to do a lot of 

00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:19.010
 things and especially export because 

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:20.840
 I love going on the international traveling 

00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:23.530
 but also i love to speak english 

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:26.930
 I love to introduce to foreigners 

00:02:23.530 --> 00:02:29.930
 our magnificent region is generally 

00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:31.580
 uses three main grape varieties on 

00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:34.070
 pinot noir the pinot meunier the 

00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:35.390
 chardonnay so for the moment have done 

00:02:34.070 --> 00:02:37.340
 3000 bottles 

00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:39.440
 so it's very little it's really a 

00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:41.360
 tank is confidential I would like 

00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:43.640
 to introduce oak barrels since in 

00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:46.670
 plus my name c du chan I find it 

00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:49.600
 so logical to have a vintage casks 

00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:52.030
 oak in the duchesne is also 

00:02:49.600 --> 00:02:54.290
 go on vinifications of red 

00:02:52.030 --> 00:02:56.510
 that I find very interesting especially 

00:02:54.290 --> 00:03:00.080
 in champagne and more specifically to 

00:02:56.510 --> 00:03:02.480
 cumieres which is also a very well known 

00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:04.880
 for its red wine 

00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:06.860
 it's a very old cellar that dates from 

00:03:04.880 --> 00:03:09.140
 the construction of the house that 

00:03:06.860 --> 00:03:10.250
 I would like to rearrange with my friend because 

00:03:09.140 --> 00:03:11.660
 that the magic 

00:03:10.250 --> 00:03:14.690
 everyone tell me every time 

00:03:11.660 --> 00:03:17.780
 that the visit we still see the bricks 

00:03:14.690 --> 00:03:20.810
 we see the millstone that was put back on 

00:03:17.780 --> 00:03:22.850
 and people love touched the chalk and 

00:03:20.810 --> 00:03:26.020
 the degree of temperature is perfect for 

00:03:22.850 --> 00:03:26.020
 socke and bottles
