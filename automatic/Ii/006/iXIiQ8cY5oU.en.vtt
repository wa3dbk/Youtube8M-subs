00:00:04.640 --> 00:00:09.299
 how are you all had a very good day 

00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:10.230
 today we are going to make a pumpkin of 

00:00:09.299 --> 00:00:12.179
 easy way 

00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:16.129
 we start first let's start 

00:00:12.179 --> 00:00:18.830
 then doing the part 

00:00:16.129 --> 00:00:22.310
 circular in this case we come more or 

00:00:18.830 --> 00:00:25.700
 less until here and here we come 

00:00:22.310 --> 00:00:27.670
 we try to do something similar 

00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:31.119
 up here 

00:00:27.670 --> 00:00:33.390
 and from here we try to continue 

00:00:31.119 --> 00:00:36.780
 the line 

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:39.660
 until now this is going to happen 

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:41.970
 then we come to our part of 

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:45.120
 the eyes 

00:00:41.970 --> 00:00:49.110
 we come here we also work here 

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:52.820
 yes and a line that comes up here then 

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:56.370
 a line that comes up here this 

00:00:52.820 --> 00:00:59.640
 come we do the inside part like this 

00:00:56.370 --> 00:01:02.190
 that ends in triangular form since 

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:04.680
 we started we depart here and here 

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:07.110
 here comes until the nose 

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:09.770
 we come also we make a triangle 

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:12.700
 and here a little that comes up here 

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:15.040
 let's make the mouth 

00:01:12.700 --> 00:01:19.530
 come here 

00:01:15.040 --> 00:01:19.530
 we make this series of spikes 

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:29.180
 we go down we go up we go and here it tells us 

00:01:25.090 --> 00:01:32.860
 we come from here here we go up 

00:01:29.180 --> 00:01:32.860
 we try from here on the same line 

00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:38.780
 we came 

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:42.890
 in this way and we work until here 

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:44.880
 now we are going to play a part in 

00:01:42.890 --> 00:01:49.460
 top part 

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:49.460
 minimal then in this way 

00:01:50.390 --> 00:01:56.360
 you do not take out 

00:01:52.970 --> 00:02:00.790
 here 

00:01:56.360 --> 00:02:04.400
 and here we had here a stick us here 

00:02:00.790 --> 00:02:07.070
 we came here now what are we going to do 

00:02:04.400 --> 00:02:08.950
 so let's try to give it a 

00:02:07.070 --> 00:02:12.610
 little shade to the bottom 

00:02:08.950 --> 00:02:12.610
 the inner part 

00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:20.790
 thus 

00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:32.850
 we come here in the same way we come with 

00:02:28.710 --> 00:02:37.010
 the nose all this part of here 

00:02:32.850 --> 00:02:37.010
 and we come with the part of the eyes 

00:02:40.990 --> 00:02:47.250
 so we come here also 

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:47.250
 fill in 

00:02:48.599 --> 00:02:53.940
 you 

00:02:51.210 --> 00:02:58.670
 and now we're going to habituation because I have 

00:02:53.940 --> 00:03:01.900
 more shadow for this side 

00:02:58.670 --> 00:03:01.900
 until we arrived here 

00:03:04.210 --> 00:03:07.500
 another shadow here 

00:03:07.660 --> 00:03:10.710
 from this part 

00:03:13.860 --> 00:03:20.240
 and now then let's give it a 

00:03:16.530 --> 00:03:20.240
 little more than a circle 

00:03:23.950 --> 00:03:28.290
 and here we try to do something similar 

00:03:32.450 --> 00:03:37.360
 very good now and this house 

00:03:35.160 --> 00:03:40.530
 to highlight 

00:03:37.360 --> 00:03:40.530
 here we are equally 

00:03:48.190 --> 00:03:53.110
 and now we give it a little scomber in 

00:03:50.830 --> 00:03:55.540
 the house we try to make this part is 

00:03:53.110 --> 00:03:57.840
 a little round 

00:03:55.540 --> 00:04:00.830
 A) Yes 

00:03:57.840 --> 00:04:03.790
 we give you an effect 

00:04:00.830 --> 00:04:03.790
 at the bottom 

00:04:06.250 --> 00:04:12.909
 and here 

00:04:08.180 --> 00:04:12.909
 and here we come to take 

00:04:13.760 --> 00:04:18.680
 then we received a little bit here and 

00:04:16.880 --> 00:04:21.100
 over here and we will give almost by 

00:04:18.680 --> 00:04:21.100
 finished 

00:04:22.530 --> 00:04:27.510
 and ready so the pumpkin waited for them 

00:04:26.130 --> 00:04:30.860
 have liked to see you in a next 

00:04:27.510 --> 00:04:30.860
 tutorial until next time 

00:04:34.840 --> 00:04:37.840
