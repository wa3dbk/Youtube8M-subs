00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:15.210 
whether it's a real simple telltale when

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:16.910 
whether it's a real simple telltale when

carpeting to remove the dirt if that's

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:31.040 
carpeting to remove the dirt if that's
not<00:00:29.519> happening<00:00:29.580> and<00:00:30.240> it's<00:00:30.330> taken<00:00:30.630> two<00:00:30.840> or

three<00:00:31.289> or<00:00:31.410> four<00:00:31.439> laps<00:00:31.859> you've<00:00:32.309> got<00:00:32.520> a

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:32.550 
three or four laps you've got a

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:36.319 
three or four laps you've got a
maintenance<00:00:33.030> issue<00:00:33.230> so<00:00:35.000> there<00:00:36.000> are<00:00:36.120> three

00:00:36.319 --> 00:00:36.329 
maintenance issue so there are three

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:38.180 
maintenance issue so there are three
kind<00:00:36.540> of<00:00:36.600> telltale<00:00:37.020> signs<00:00:37.410> or<00:00:37.710> three<00:00:37.950> things

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:38.190 
kind of telltale signs or three things

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:40.100 
kind of telltale signs or three things
that<00:00:38.399> you<00:00:38.489> can<00:00:38.670> check<00:00:38.940> the<00:00:39.300> brush<00:00:39.570> power<00:00:39.870> and

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:40.110 
that you can check the brush power and

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:41.299 
that you can check the brush power and
the<00:00:40.200> belt<00:00:40.410> which<00:00:40.620> we<00:00:40.770> covered<00:00:41.070> under<00:00:41.280> a

00:00:41.299 --> 00:00:41.309 
the belt which we covered under a

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:43.280 
the belt which we covered under a
separate<00:00:41.700> video<00:00:41.850> already<00:00:42.270> and<00:00:42.899> now<00:00:43.110> we're

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:43.290 
separate video already and now we're

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:46.400 
separate video already and now we're
going<00:00:43.379> to<00:00:43.440> talk<00:00:43.649> about<00:00:43.829> suction<00:00:44.989> suction<00:00:45.989> can

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:46.410 
going to talk about suction suction can

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:48.680 
going to talk about suction suction can
be<00:00:46.530> impacted<00:00:47.250> or<00:00:47.460> reduced<00:00:47.910> I<00:00:48.090> should<00:00:48.270> say<00:00:48.480> by<00:00:48.660> a

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:48.690 
be impacted or reduced I should say by a

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:50.240 
be impacted or reduced I should say by a
couple<00:00:48.930> of<00:00:49.170> things<00:00:49.350> the<00:00:49.649> first<00:00:49.920> and<00:00:50.160> most

00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:50.250 
couple of things the first and most

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:52.880 
couple of things the first and most
obvious<00:00:50.520> thing<00:00:51.059> is<00:00:51.570> if<00:00:51.930> your<00:00:52.140> bag<00:00:52.500> is

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:52.890 
obvious thing is if your bag is

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:57.080 
obvious thing is if your bag is
overfilled<00:00:54.710> change<00:00:55.710> the<00:00:55.949> bag<00:00:56.160> the<00:00:56.789> more

00:00:57.080 --> 00:00:57.090 
overfilled change the bag the more

00:00:57.090 --> 00:00:59.900 
overfilled change the bag the more
airflow<00:00:58.050> that<00:00:58.620> can<00:00:58.800> run<00:00:59.010> through<00:00:59.250> the<00:00:59.340> bag<00:00:59.520> the

00:00:59.900 --> 00:00:59.910 
airflow that can run through the bag the

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:01.580 
airflow that can run through the bag the
better<00:01:00.030> suction<00:01:00.600> the<00:01:00.660> machine<00:01:01.020> has<00:01:01.260> and<00:01:01.530> the

00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:01.590 
better suction the machine has and the

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:04.219 
better suction the machine has and the
better<00:01:01.770> can<00:01:02.039> pick<00:01:02.219> up<00:01:02.370> its<00:01:02.579> dirt<00:01:03.210> so<00:01:04.019> if<00:01:04.140> the

00:01:04.219 --> 00:01:04.229 
better can pick up its dirt so if the

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:06.080 
better can pick up its dirt so if the
bag<00:01:04.439> is<00:01:04.470> overfilled<00:01:05.369> it<00:01:05.549> will<00:01:05.670> cut<00:01:05.880> down<00:01:05.909> on

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:06.090 
bag is overfilled it will cut down on

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:08.480 
bag is overfilled it will cut down on
air<00:01:06.360> flow<00:01:06.630> now<00:01:07.380> a<00:01:07.409> lot<00:01:07.710> of<00:01:07.740> my<00:01:07.830> customers<00:01:08.159> in

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:08.490 
air flow now a lot of my customers in

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:10.609 
air flow now a lot of my customers in
Chicago<00:01:08.820> have<00:01:09.000> DICE's<00:01:09.510> which<00:01:10.170> don't<00:01:10.439> have

00:01:10.609 --> 00:01:10.619 
Chicago have DICE's which don't have

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:13.940 
Chicago have DICE's which don't have
bags<00:01:10.950> same<00:01:11.760> theory<00:01:12.360> if<00:01:12.540> the<00:01:12.869> bin<00:01:13.140> the<00:01:13.409> dump<00:01:13.680> bin

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:13.950 
bags same theory if the bin the dump bin

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:16.429 
bags same theory if the bin the dump bin
is<00:01:14.520> overfilled<00:01:15.299> it's<00:01:15.659> gonna<00:01:15.840> cut<00:01:16.110> down<00:01:16.290> on

00:01:16.429 --> 00:01:16.439 
is overfilled it's gonna cut down on

00:01:16.439 --> 00:01:18.499 
is overfilled it's gonna cut down on
suction<00:01:16.799> so<00:01:17.520> that's<00:01:17.700> the<00:01:17.850> first<00:01:18.090> thing<00:01:18.210> I<00:01:18.330> want

00:01:18.499 --> 00:01:18.509 
suction so that's the first thing I want

00:01:18.509 --> 00:01:20.390 
suction so that's the first thing I want
you<00:01:18.600> to<00:01:18.630> do<00:01:18.840> is<00:01:18.990> check<00:01:19.229> the<00:01:19.290> bin<00:01:19.619> or<00:01:19.950> the<00:01:20.009> bag

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:20.400 
you to do is check the bin or the bag

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:23.570 
you to do is check the bin or the bag
easy<00:01:21.240> solution<00:01:21.960> the<00:01:22.590> second<00:01:23.100> thing<00:01:23.250> I<00:01:23.369> want

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:23.580 
easy solution the second thing I want

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:26.149 
easy solution the second thing I want
you<00:01:23.640> to<00:01:23.700> check<00:01:23.970> is<00:01:24.180> the<00:01:24.330> pre<00:01:24.689> filter<00:01:25.159> the

00:01:26.149 --> 00:01:26.159 
you to check is the pre filter the

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:29.870 
you to check is the pre filter the
prefilter<00:01:26.189> is<00:01:27.060> usually<00:01:27.630> found<00:01:28.490> right<00:01:29.490> behind

00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:29.880 
prefilter is usually found right behind

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:31.999 
prefilter is usually found right behind
the<00:01:30.210> bag<00:01:30.390> right<00:01:30.780> below<00:01:31.170> the<00:01:31.409> bag<00:01:31.619> right
