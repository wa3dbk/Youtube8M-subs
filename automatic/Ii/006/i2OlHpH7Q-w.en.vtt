00:01:41.359 --> 00:01:41.369 
hotbar but that is normal that is what

00:01:41.369 --> 00:01:43.190 
hotbar but that is normal that is what
this<00:01:41.520> mod<00:01:41.729> actually<00:01:42.210> does<00:01:42.420> so<00:01:42.899> what<00:01:43.079> we're

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:43.200 
this mod actually does so what we're

this mod actually does so what we're
doing<00:01:43.229> right<00:01:43.560> now<00:01:43.619> we're<00:01:43.950> telling<00:01:44.159> the<00:01:44.369> iron

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:44.610 
doing right now we're telling the iron

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:46.999 
doing right now we're telling the iron
frame<00:01:44.880> what<00:01:45.180> we<00:01:45.360> want<00:01:45.600> it<00:01:45.840> to<00:01:46.079> display<00:01:46.259> in<00:01:46.740> the

00:01:47.009 --> 00:01:48.440 
frame what we want it to display in the
frame<00:01:47.250> so<00:01:47.460> we're<00:01:47.610> doing<00:01:47.850> that<00:01:48.000> and<00:01:48.149> it's

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:48.450 
frame so we're doing that and it's

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:49.999 
frame so we're doing that and it's
saying<00:01:48.659> it's<00:01:48.840> going<00:01:48.960> to<00:01:49.020> display<00:01:49.530> a<00:01:49.560> diamond

00:01:49.999 --> 00:01:50.009

00:01:50.009 --> 00:01:51.380 
saying it's going to display a diamond
helmet<00:01:50.130> or<00:01:50.399> wind<00:01:50.579> to<00:01:50.729> do<00:01:50.820> now<00:01:50.970> is<00:01:51.119> hit<00:01:51.180> escape

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:51.390 
helmet or wind to do now is hit escape

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:54.319 
helmet or wind to do now is hit escape
and<00:01:51.689> then<00:01:52.259> the<00:01:52.439> item<00:01:52.770> frame<00:01:52.979> will<00:01:53.340> display<00:01:53.820> the

00:01:57.410 --> 00:01:57.420 
texture is slightly different it's an

00:01:57.420 --> 00:01:59.569 
texture is slightly different it's an
item<00:01:57.570> frame<00:01:57.960> with<00:01:58.170> a<00:01:58.200> crafting<00:01:58.680> table<00:01:58.890> top<00:01:59.340> in

item frame with a crafting table top in
the<00:01:59.729> background<00:02:00.119> so<00:02:00.600> let<00:02:00.810> me<00:02:00.960> show<00:02:01.170> you<00:02:01.229> how<00:02:01.770> it

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:02.070 
the background so let me show you how it

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:03.679 
the background so let me show you how it
actually<00:02:02.280> works<00:02:02.820> so<00:02:03.030> once<00:02:03.240> we've<00:02:03.450> done<00:02:03.479> that

00:02:03.679 --> 00:02:03.689 
actually works so once we've done that

00:02:03.689 --> 00:02:06.109 
actually works so once we've done that
once<00:02:04.200> we've<00:02:04.380> created<00:02:04.710> the<00:02:05.070> super<00:02:05.520> item<00:02:05.939> frame

00:02:06.109 --> 00:02:06.119 
once we've created the super item frame

00:02:06.119 --> 00:02:08.210 
once we've created the super item frame

00:06:01.129 --> 00:06:01.139 
do that one gets rid of them all right I

00:06:01.139 --> 00:06:03.680 
do that one gets rid of them all right I
think<00:06:01.259> if<00:06:01.680> you<00:06:01.830> hold<00:06:02.069> shift<00:06:02.520> I<00:06:02.819> think<00:06:03.000> it<00:06:03.120> is<00:06:03.240> it

00:06:03.680 --> 00:06:03.690 
think if you hold shift I think it is it

00:06:03.690 --> 00:06:05.330 
think if you hold shift I think it is it
will<00:06:03.870> only<00:06:04.050> do<00:06:04.199> one<00:06:04.349> at<00:06:04.469> a<00:06:04.500> time<00:06:04.680> I<00:06:04.860> know<00:06:05.310> I

00:06:05.330 --> 00:06:05.340 
will only do one at a time I know I

00:06:05.340 --> 00:06:07.459 
will only do one at a time I know I
think<00:06:05.490> maybe<00:06:05.759> left<00:06:06.360> click<00:06:06.659> is<00:06:06.779> one<00:06:06.960> of<00:06:07.080> time<00:06:07.289> so

00:06:07.459 --> 00:06:07.469 
think maybe left click is one of time so

00:06:07.469 --> 00:06:10.159 
think maybe left click is one of time so
let<00:06:07.590> me<00:06:07.710> do<00:06:08.190> this<00:06:08.370> chest<00:06:08.789> the<00:06:09.630> left<00:06:09.990> click

00:06:10.159 --> 00:06:10.169 
let me do this chest the left click

00:06:10.169 --> 00:06:12.350 
let me do this chest the left click
destroys<00:06:10.650> the<00:06:10.740> frame<00:06:10.919> so<00:06:11.669> I<00:06:11.729> think<00:06:12.150> it<00:06:12.240> gets

00:06:12.350 --> 00:06:12.360 
destroys the frame so I think it gets

00:06:12.360 --> 00:06:13.850 
destroys the frame so I think it gets
rid<00:06:12.569> of<00:06:12.599> the<00:06:12.750> whole<00:06:12.930> stack<00:06:13.289> so<00:06:13.590> if<00:06:13.710> I<00:06:13.800> get

00:06:13.850 --> 00:06:13.860 
rid of the whole stack so if I get

00:06:13.860 --> 00:06:15.890 
rid of the whole stack so if I get
right-click<00:06:14.490> now<00:06:14.639> I<00:06:14.849> don't<00:06:15.090> let's<00:06:15.509> do<00:06:15.630> one<00:06:15.810> at

00:06:15.890 --> 00:06:15.900 
right-click now I don't let's do one at

00:06:15.900 --> 00:06:17.089 
right-click now I don't let's do one at
a<00:06:15.930> time<00:06:16.110> but<00:06:16.349> then<00:06:16.500> it<00:06:16.620> gets<00:06:16.680> rid<00:06:16.860> of<00:06:16.889> the<00:06:16.949> whole

00:06:17.089 --> 00:06:17.099 
a time but then it gets rid of the whole

00:06:17.099 --> 00:06:18.559 
a time but then it gets rid of the whole
stay<00:06:17.250> it<00:06:17.370> might<00:06:17.520> be<00:06:17.639> a<00:06:17.669> little<00:06:17.789> bit<00:06:18.000> buggy<00:06:18.180> I'm

00:06:18.559 --> 00:06:18.569 
stay it might be a little bit buggy I'm

00:06:18.569 --> 00:06:19.790 
stay it might be a little bit buggy I'm
not<00:06:18.840> actually<00:06:18.930> sure<00:06:19.110> because<00:06:19.469> if<00:06:19.560> you<00:06:19.680> saw

00:06:19.790 --> 00:06:19.800 
not actually sure because if you saw

00:06:19.800 --> 00:06:21.379 
not actually sure because if you saw
there<00:06:20.009> just<00:06:20.219> got<00:06:20.340> rid<00:06:20.460> of<00:06:20.520> one<00:06:20.729> and<00:06:20.969> then<00:06:21.180> rid

00:06:21.379 --> 00:06:21.389 
there just got rid of one and then rid

of<00:06:21.479> the<00:06:21.539> whole<00:06:21.690> stack<00:06:21.930> but<00:06:22.349> that's<00:06:22.500> what<00:06:22.590> it

00:06:22.670 --> 00:06:22.680 
of the whole stack but that's what it

00:06:22.680 --> 00:06:22.969 
of the whole stack but that's what it
does

00:06:22.969 --> 00:06:22.979 
does

00:06:22.979 --> 00:06:25.309
