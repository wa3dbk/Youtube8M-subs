work out line choice is always critical

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:19.939 
work out line choice is always critical
in<00:00:19.050> mountain<00:00:19.439> biking<00:00:19.710> but<00:00:19.800> on<00:00:19.920> a

in mountain biking but on a
cross-country<00:00:20.279> hardtail<00:00:20.820> perhaps<00:00:21.510> even<00:00:21.720> more

so<00:00:22.439> you're<00:00:22.830> going<00:00:22.949> to<00:00:22.980> have<00:00:23.100> to<00:00:23.279> choose

00:00:23.450 --> 00:00:23.460 
so you're going to have to choose

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:25.550 
so you're going to have to choose
different<00:00:23.699> lines<00:00:24.090> you<00:00:24.600> might<00:00:24.779> do<00:00:25.019> on<00:00:25.170> a<00:00:25.260> bigger

00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:25.560

00:00:57.500 --> 00:00:57.510 
few meters down the trail the faster you

your saddle now if you do drop your seat

00:01:27.400 --> 00:01:28.950 
your saddle now if you do drop your seat
then<00:01:27.700> you<00:01:27.790> also<00:01:27.910> want<00:01:28.270> to<00:01:28.330> drop<00:01:28.540> your<00:01:28.720> heels

thing<00:01:50.290> that<00:01:50.350> goes<00:01:50.650> in<00:01:50.800> the<00:01:50.890> favor<00:01:51.190> of<00:01:51.340> hard

00:01:51.690 --> 00:01:51.700 
thing that goes in the favor of hard

00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:54.090 
thing that goes in the favor of hard
tails<00:01:52.000> is<00:01:52.210> pedal<00:01:52.630> clearance<00:01:53.020> generally<00:01:53.710> it's

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:54.100

tails is pedal clearance generally it's
a<00:01:54.190> little<00:01:54.340> bit<00:01:54.430> greater<00:01:54.670> than<00:01:54.880> hard<00:01:55.180> tail<00:01:55.390> on<00:01:55.540> a

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:55.600 
a little bit greater than hard tail on a

00:01:55.600 --> 00:01:57.090 
a little bit greater than hard tail on a
full<00:01:55.780> suspension<00:01:55.930> bike<00:01:56.380> so<00:01:56.530> what<00:01:56.619> it<00:01:56.710> means<00:01:56.770> is

00:01:57.090 --> 00:01:57.100 
full suspension bike so what it means is

00:01:57.100 --> 00:01:58.800 
full suspension bike so what it means is
you<00:01:57.280> can<00:01:57.400> actually<00:01:57.520> keep<00:01:57.880> pedaling<00:01:58.360> for

00:01:58.800 --> 00:01:58.810 
you can actually keep pedaling for

00:01:58.810 --> 00:02:01.020 
you can actually keep pedaling for
longer<00:01:59.200> through<00:01:59.710> really<00:02:00.070> difficult<00:02:00.190> sections

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:01.030 
longer through really difficult sections

00:02:01.030 --> 00:02:03.719 
longer through really difficult sections
and<00:02:01.210> I<00:02:01.509> also<00:02:01.690> find<00:02:01.990> is<00:02:02.350> an<00:02:02.530> extra<00:02:02.890> bonus<00:02:03.160> that

00:02:03.719 --> 00:02:03.729 
and I also find is an extra bonus that

00:02:03.729 --> 00:02:05.190 
and I also find is an extra bonus that
pedaling<00:02:04.240> through<00:02:04.540> really<00:02:04.750> rough<00:02:05.050> or

00:02:05.190 --> 00:02:05.200 
pedaling through really rough or

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:07.469 
pedaling through really rough or
technical<00:02:05.560> sections<00:02:05.950> actually<00:02:06.190> really<00:02:07.060> helps

00:02:07.469 --> 00:02:07.479 
technical sections actually really helps

00:02:07.479 --> 00:02:08.880 
technical sections actually really helps
to<00:02:07.600> keep<00:02:07.750> the<00:02:07.869> bike<00:02:08.110> under<00:02:08.530> a<00:02:08.560> bit<00:02:08.739> more

00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:08.890 
to keep the bike under a bit more

00:02:08.890 --> 00:02:10.800 
to keep the bike under a bit more
control<00:02:09.340> now<00:02:09.820> you'll<00:02:10.030> see<00:02:10.179> it<00:02:10.300> if<00:02:10.390> you<00:02:10.479> try<00:02:10.750> it

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:10.810 
control now you'll see it if you try it

00:02:10.810 --> 00:02:12.000 
control now you'll see it if you try it
doesn't<00:02:11.260> even<00:02:11.320> have<00:02:11.470> to<00:02:11.500> be<00:02:11.560> a<00:02:11.650> particularly

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:12.010 
doesn't even have to be a particularly

00:02:12.010 --> 00:02:14.340 
doesn't even have to be a particularly
rough<00:02:12.280> section<00:02:12.550> of<00:02:12.700> trail<00:02:12.940> but<00:02:13.390> do<00:02:13.900> one<00:02:14.140> run

00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:14.350 
rough section of trail but do one run

00:02:14.350 --> 00:02:15.870 
rough section of trail but do one run
freewheeling<00:02:15.010> through<00:02:15.220> and<00:02:15.430> then<00:02:15.550> one<00:02:15.730> run

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:15.880 
freewheeling through and then one run

pedaling<00:02:16.300> through<00:02:16.330> compare<00:02:17.080> the<00:02:17.170> two<00:02:17.320> and

00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:17.560 
pedaling through compare the two and

00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:22.680 
pedaling through compare the two and
probably<00:02:18.160> find<00:02:18.370> exactly<00:02:19.060> the<00:02:19.150> same<00:02:21.690> sargent

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:22.690 
probably find exactly the same sargent

00:02:22.690 --> 00:02:23.880 
probably find exactly the same sargent
pedaling<00:02:23.019> there<00:02:23.170> is<00:02:23.260> another<00:02:23.560> way<00:02:23.830> to

00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:23.890 
pedaling there is another way to

00:02:23.890 --> 00:02:25.949 
pedaling there is another way to
conserve<00:02:24.459> your<00:02:24.519> momentum<00:02:24.910> and<00:02:25.300> it's<00:02:25.630> a<00:02:25.690> great

00:02:25.949 --> 00:02:25.959 
conserve your momentum and it's a great

00:02:25.959 --> 00:02:28.320 
conserve your momentum and it's a great
skill<00:02:26.320> to<00:02:26.530> perfect<00:02:26.950> without<00:02:27.489> suspension<00:02:28.150> or

00:02:28.320 --> 00:02:28.330 
skill to perfect without suspension or

00:02:28.330 --> 00:02:29.850 
skill to perfect without suspension or
just<00:02:28.600> be<00:02:28.690> less<00:02:28.900> of<00:02:28.930> it<00:02:29.170> you<00:02:29.290> have<00:02:29.470> to<00:02:29.500> absorb

00:02:29.850 --> 00:02:29.860 
just be less of it you have to absorb

00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:31.710 
just be less of it you have to absorb
more<00:02:30.190> of<00:02:30.250> the<00:02:30.400> shocks<00:02:30.670> to<00:02:31.209> keep<00:02:31.360> your<00:02:31.510> wheels

00:02:31.710 --> 00:02:31.720 
more of the shocks to keep your wheels

00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:33.690 
more of the shocks to keep your wheels
rolling<00:02:32.080> so<00:02:32.470> you<00:02:32.739> need<00:02:32.890> to<00:02:33.010> learn<00:02:33.220> to<00:02:33.280> ride

00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:33.700 
rolling so you need to learn to ride

00:02:33.700 --> 00:02:35.610 
rolling so you need to learn to ride
light<00:02:34.090> clearly<00:02:34.900> there's<00:02:35.049> actually<00:02:35.320> no<00:02:35.440> way<00:02:35.560> of

00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:35.620 
light clearly there's actually no way of

00:02:35.620 --> 00:02:37.350 
light clearly there's actually no way of
making<00:02:35.980> yourself<00:02:36.070> lighter<00:02:36.489> but<00:02:36.940> you<00:02:37.239> can

00:02:37.350 --> 00:02:37.360 
making yourself lighter but you can

00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:39.449 
making yourself lighter but you can
unweight<00:02:37.870> four<00:02:38.230> key<00:02:38.380> sections<00:02:38.920> and<00:02:39.340> this

00:02:39.449 --> 00:02:39.459 
unweight four key sections and this

00:02:39.459 --> 00:02:41.220 
unweight four key sections and this
means<00:02:39.670> that<00:02:39.880> you<00:02:40.150> bounce<00:02:40.420> on<00:02:40.630> the<00:02:40.750> pedals<00:02:41.080> just

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:41.230 
means that you bounce on the pedals just

00:02:41.230 --> 00:02:43.289 
means that you bounce on the pedals just
before<00:02:41.830> a<00:02:41.860> rough<00:02:42.100> section<00:02:42.370> of<00:02:42.580> trail<00:02:42.760> and<00:02:42.940> then

00:02:43.289 --> 00:02:43.299 
before a rough section of trail and then

00:02:43.299 --> 00:02:45.240 
before a rough section of trail and then
effectively<00:02:43.720> try<00:02:44.049> to<00:02:44.110> float<00:02:44.650> the<00:02:44.799> bike<00:02:45.010> over

effectively try to float the bike over
it<00:02:45.519> it's<00:02:46.150> like<00:02:46.269> a<00:02:46.299> very<00:02:46.480> primitive<00:02:46.810> form<00:02:47.019> of

it it's like a very primitive form of

it it's like a very primitive form of
bunny<00:02:47.530> hopping<00:02:47.769> and<00:02:48.250> anyone<00:02:48.580> can<00:02:48.730> do<00:02:48.910> it<00:02:49.060> but

00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:49.600

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:07.510
