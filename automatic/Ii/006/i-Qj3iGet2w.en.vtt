00:00:03.399 --> 00:00:08.420
 welcome to the wine shop of valpolicella 

00:00:06.140 --> 00:00:11.059
 today we open our kitchen for 

00:00:08.420 --> 00:00:13.309
 offer you a couple of recipes the first 

00:00:11.059 --> 00:00:15.169
 of which will be the ravioli with the 

00:00:13.309 --> 00:00:17.380
 a dish filled with truffle 

00:00:15.169 --> 00:00:19.449
 we normally present here at the wine shop 

00:00:17.380 --> 00:00:21.590
 quite simple to make 

00:00:19.449 --> 00:00:24.109
 particularly interesting this year 

00:00:21.590 --> 00:00:26.000
 because our scorzone truffle is from 

00:00:24.109 --> 00:00:29.449
 excellent quality 

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:32.720
 the very simple ingredients the truffle 

00:00:29.449 --> 00:00:36.770
 black the scorzone we normally see 

00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:38.719
 so it is a grated trick not 

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:40.820
 ground to prevent them from remaining 

00:00:38.719 --> 00:00:43.579
 inside the grains and then 

00:00:40.820 --> 00:00:45.860
 when you eat ravioli, have this one 

00:00:43.579 --> 00:00:47.809
 grainy texture so instead of a 

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:49.899
 contact with heat melts and 

00:00:47.809 --> 00:00:52.670
 leave only Rome free 

00:00:49.899 --> 00:00:54.079
 ricotta a mixed ricotta of sheep of 

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:56.690
 so quite dry cow 

00:00:54.079 --> 00:01:00.469
 Parmesan cheese certainly a bit of 

00:00:56.690 --> 00:01:04.010
 Let's start butter and salt and pepper competitions 

00:01:00.469 --> 00:01:06.130
 then with the ricotta which 

00:01:04.010 --> 00:01:09.190
 we add in the right amount 

00:01:06.130 --> 00:01:13.690
 of course that is evaluated 

00:01:09.190 --> 00:01:24.670
 occasionally the generous truffle always 

00:01:13.690 --> 00:01:35.170
 also the Parmesan butter that we do 

00:01:24.670 --> 00:01:49.660
 serves to tie a little pepper and salt 

00:01:35.170 --> 00:01:53.680
 this is the consistency of mixing 

00:01:49.660 --> 00:01:56.710
 we have very very simple view from from 

00:01:53.680 --> 00:01:58.450
 prepare and use immediately does not have 

00:01:56.710 --> 00:02:00.490
 need for rest does not need to 

00:01:58.450 --> 00:02:03.340
 nothing 

00:02:00.490 --> 00:02:06.670
 in the meantime we have turned over pasta a lot 

00:02:03.340 --> 00:02:10.570
 thin must be nice moist because 

00:02:06.670 --> 00:02:12.460
 otherwise it does not attack we do not use 

00:02:10.570 --> 00:02:15.040
 normally neither water nor oil for 

00:02:12.460 --> 00:02:20.080
 paste it we only use the fact that 

00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:23.680
 be very fresh cut quickly a 

00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:26.800
 quadratoni we have our filling in 

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:31.510
 a bag then we prepared the 

00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:34.330
 square and now folded no more than 

00:02:31.510 --> 00:02:36.700
 a minute and a half minute in abundance 

00:02:34.330 --> 00:02:40.019
 salt water over just a little butter 

00:02:36.700 --> 00:02:42.940
 melted and a handful of Parmesan 

00:02:40.019 --> 00:02:46.320
 here they are, they were in the water like 

00:02:42.940 --> 00:02:46.320
 we said no more than a minute 

00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:59.249
 there is a nice grated Parmesan cheese 

00:02:53.549 --> 00:03:05.629
 above and more to make the dish look good 

00:02:59.249 --> 00:03:08.489
 for the taste a veil of truffle above 

00:03:05.629 --> 00:03:10.739
 we combine with ravioli with the filling of 

00:03:08.489 --> 00:03:11.430
 truffle a nice polycella from grapes 

00:03:10.739 --> 00:03:13.799
 biological 

00:03:11.430 --> 00:03:17.310
 the company valentina cubi a brave 

00:03:13.799 --> 00:03:19.709
 lady who in her vineyards of Verona 

00:03:17.310 --> 00:03:22.620
 produces the grapes then destined for this 

00:03:19.709 --> 00:03:25.739
 very light wine very very light 

00:03:22.620 --> 00:03:27.840
 scented all the whole valpolicella 

00:03:25.739 --> 00:03:31.829
 it reads perfectly why almost 

00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:35.540
 floral to be honest is perfect for 

00:03:31.829 --> 00:03:35.540
 the perfect summer for pasta dishes
