 peace abroad tries to go on 

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:13.380
 powell v that as expected had been 

00:00:11.519 --> 00:00:15.750
 very fast but it goes to the right 

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:17.789
 he immediately established himself in command 

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:21.390
 comparisons of power b while the third 

00:00:17.789 --> 00:00:25.320
 position for clear pioneer while 

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:28.170
 outside is the number 11 immediately 

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:31.529
 painted in white and the wise and that goes 

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:34.200
 at the side of the color partner power b 

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:37.320
 when we are now in front he already has 

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:40.079
 picked up on how she and the group are 

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:42.410
 it goes like this and gathering compenti in white 

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:44.879
 which now goes to give a little one 

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:49.559
 teasing the tread gait 

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:53.370
 31 and a half the transition to the first 400 

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:55.590
 meters with painting looking for them now 

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:57.629
 digging in place is the hope that the 

00:00:55.590 --> 00:01:00.090
 mate the colors succeed in some 

00:00:57.629 --> 00:01:03.899
 so they do queue then it still remains 

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:06.000
 to the side it passes to the s 46 and a half while 

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:10.250
 the back painted in trouble if it was 

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:14.010
 taken as a peer when we are now at 

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:17.130
 completion of the fold there is palomar 

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:19.409
 lb intense external shortage 1 and 2 scarce 

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:22.710
 the transition to 800 meters and passes 

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:26.490
 remains in command with painting always at 

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:28.920
 its exterior then still powell alley 

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:32.759
 outside paride then again a 

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:36.900
 pioneer race with nearby paloma in v 1 

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:39.689
 16 4 the passage to km per pass 

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:42.150
 the being that continues to lead with 

00:01:39.689 --> 00:01:45.630
 always at the seat painting wise 

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:49.439
 when we are now at 800 from the finish line 

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:51.810
 while both the thrust of flourishes 

00:01:49.439 --> 00:01:54.329
 paride that now recedes to the side of 

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:56.700
 pioneer race when we are from 

00:01:54.329 --> 00:01:59.670
 front with boiled band that tends to 

00:01:56.700 --> 00:02:01.710
 lengthen 400 in vain from the pole in half from 

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:04.409
 companies in front have gone to 29 and 

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:06.329
 half pass reads that stretches and seeks 

00:02:04.409 --> 00:02:08.550
 time to dig a groove between himself and him 

00:02:06.329 --> 00:02:11.970
 opponents try to find to run 

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:12.819
 bayern race that hespress held back by 

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:16.420
 drop d 

00:02:12.819 --> 00:02:18.450
 the painting wise is now to be discovered 

00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:21.579
 how meanwhile there is a break for 

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:23.620
 pennywise also for power b meanwhile 

00:02:21.579 --> 00:02:26.290
 in front of me now he is now doing 

00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:28.109
 race if at about twenty meters 

00:02:26.290 --> 00:02:30.519
 advantage over the rest of the company 

00:02:28.109 --> 00:02:32.650
 would pass that now runs against the 

00:02:30.519 --> 00:02:34.689
 time probably wants the best 

00:02:32.650 --> 00:02:37.870
 time to be able to have the best 

00:02:34.689 --> 00:02:39.760
 number from the outside also emerges pioneer 

00:02:37.870 --> 00:02:42.849
 car that goes to get the best 

00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:47.680
 placement in front passes to the s in the 

00:02:42.849 --> 00:02:53.230
 gala and third position for paolo m 2 29 

00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:56.139
 3 per pass to the s that closed at 43 e 

00:02:53.230 --> 00:02:59.680
 half for the last 6 and left a 

00:02:56.139 --> 00:03:02.109
 sidereal distance opponents from 

00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:04.389
 which however showed a positive a 

00:03:02.109 --> 00:03:08.169
 couple deny that with this the second 

00:03:04.389 --> 00:03:10.449
 coin and third place from his 

00:03:08.169 --> 00:03:13.449
 ticket for the final is to 

00:03:10.449 --> 00:03:15.579
 paolo m number 5 so if for the first 

00:03:13.449 --> 00:03:17.409
 5 for the second 

00:03:15.579 --> 00:03:19.810

00:03:17.409 --> 00:03:22.650
