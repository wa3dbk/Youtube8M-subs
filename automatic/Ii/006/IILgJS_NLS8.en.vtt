to what's coming wrong or what he sees
is<00:01:00.480> wrong<00:01:00.629> I<00:01:02.600> think<00:01:03.600> the<00:01:03.870> team<00:01:04.110> has<00:01:04.140> been

00:01:04.429 --> 00:01:04.439 
is wrong I think the team has been

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:05.840 
is wrong I think the team has been
winning<00:01:04.619> so<00:01:04.949> it's<00:01:05.100> you<00:01:05.339> know<00:01:05.460> when<00:01:05.610> the<00:01:05.700> team

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:05.850 
winning so it's you know when the team

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:07.190 
winning so it's you know when the team
is<00:01:05.970> winning<00:01:06.090> is<00:01:06.299> difficult<00:01:06.720> to<00:01:06.840> change<00:01:06.869> the

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:07.200 
is winning is difficult to change the

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:09.740 
is winning is difficult to change the
team<00:01:07.409> I<00:01:07.680> think<00:01:08.520> there's<00:01:08.700> various<00:01:09.060> reasons<00:01:09.510> why

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:09.750 
team I think there's various reasons why

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:12.640 
team I think there's various reasons why
and<00:01:10.200> and<00:01:10.619> why<00:01:10.770> not<00:01:11.010> but<00:01:11.430> I'd<00:01:11.700> rather<00:01:11.880> keep<00:01:12.240> them
