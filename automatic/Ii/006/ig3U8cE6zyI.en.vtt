00:00:10.139 --> 00:00:14.500
 beauty talks to you 

00:00:12.580 --> 00:00:18.010
 Good today bringing you a 

00:00:14.500 --> 00:00:23.080
 very fast dynamic analysis as well 

00:00:18.010 --> 00:00:24.940
 the game tom oms that is from dark world 

00:00:23.080 --> 00:00:27.450
 that is, you will fit the li 

00:00:24.940 --> 00:00:29.380
 powerful makes the game is based on the movie 

00:00:27.450 --> 00:00:31.390
 from thor 

00:00:29.380 --> 00:00:34.329
 obviously it 's a very interesting game 

00:00:31.390 --> 00:00:36.550
 it's worth you to evaluate an indication 

00:00:34.329 --> 00:00:40.300
 That's good for you. 

00:00:36.550 --> 00:00:44.379
 good in this game you aim 

00:00:40.300 --> 00:00:47.079
 Prevent Black Elves From These Monsters 

00:00:44.379 --> 00:00:50.229
 you will have a monster of all kinds at 

00:00:47.079 --> 00:00:52.780
 and your goal is to prevent them from 

00:00:50.229 --> 00:00:55.479
 transform the world into darkness or light 

00:00:52.780 --> 00:00:57.489
 all for darkness too 

00:00:55.479 --> 00:00:59.530
 The game is based on the movie as I already 

00:00:57.489 --> 00:01:02.109
 said that makes it even more interesting 

00:00:59.530 --> 00:01:05.350
 so you can join warriors 

00:01:02.109 --> 00:01:07.120
 ne and other allies that you will 

00:01:05.350 --> 00:01:09.579
 to get through the game 

00:01:07.120 --> 00:01:13.119
 according to you you are rescuing the 

00:01:09.579 --> 00:01:16.689
 Allies are also able to put 

00:01:13.119 --> 00:01:19.000
 He can fight with you, you can 

00:01:16.689 --> 00:01:23.049
 have the help of these two forms in 

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:24.549
 asgard warriors and another is also 

00:01:23.049 --> 00:01:27.100
 get allies 

00:01:24.549 --> 00:01:30.420
 each has a goal is not have a 

00:01:27.100 --> 00:01:33.130
 different power or ability 

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:34.990
 different he fights some warriors 

00:01:33.130 --> 00:01:37.479
 fight better with how much some 

00:01:34.990 --> 00:01:40.890
 The allied enemies also have their 

00:01:37.479 --> 00:01:44.799
 effects are vague warriors 

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:48.249
 the missions are several are more than 90 

00:01:44.799 --> 00:01:49.630
 missions with you complete and logical 

00:01:48.249 --> 00:01:52.210
 who is gay death is releasing the 

00:01:49.630 --> 00:01:54.969
 update launches new missions 

00:01:52.210 --> 00:01:56.890
 Maybe it 's from what we saw it has a 

00:01:54.969 --> 00:02:02.020
 map that it is locked even though 

00:01:56.890 --> 00:02:03.939
 then it will probably release some 

00:02:02.020 --> 00:02:06.490
 missions they take around two 

00:02:03.939 --> 00:02:09.520
 minutes three minutes against those who live 

00:02:06.490 --> 00:02:13.750
 even fewer missions is your goal 

00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:16.450
 it is only to defend a specific point and 

00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:18.580
 other missions ie have to 

00:02:16.450 --> 00:02:21.849
 discovering and struggling along the way 

00:02:18.580 --> 00:02:24.190
 knowing a certain route and 

00:02:21.849 --> 00:02:26.530
 disobeying your enemies 

00:02:24.190 --> 00:02:29.050
 some have some bosses or some 

00:02:26.530 --> 00:02:32.530
 missions have more powerful bosses and 

00:02:29.050 --> 00:02:36.670
 other missions have only more monsters 

00:02:32.530 --> 00:02:38.470
 not so powerful so let's talk one 

00:02:36.670 --> 00:02:41.260
 little game graphic 

00:02:38.470 --> 00:02:43.959
 the graphics are good in used in addition 

00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:48.280
 very vibrant color very interesting 

00:02:43.959 --> 00:02:50.260
 The game looks pretty good on his model. 

00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:53.799
 it's well worked 

00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:57.329
 you see a graphic quality legal nothing 

00:02:53.799 --> 00:03:00.220
 what if our here is different 

00:02:57.329 --> 00:03:01.690
 Sensational is a good chart you 

00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:03.549
 will you be able to see 

00:03:01.690 --> 00:03:05.709
 according to the display of your 

00:03:03.549 --> 00:03:07.810
 according to gpu that the device will be 

00:03:05.709 --> 00:03:10.780
 better than other appliances 

00:03:07.810 --> 00:03:13.750
 in my case I used it on motorola razr 

00:03:10.780 --> 00:03:16.390
 but if you test on a s4 in full screen 

00:03:13.750 --> 00:03:18.340
 hd will realize that there is a large 

00:03:16.390 --> 00:03:19.360
 difference in quality was also 

00:03:18.340 --> 00:03:24.220
 very good 

00:03:19.360 --> 00:03:26.560
 the graphics used there have the power to 

00:03:24.220 --> 00:03:29.230
 processing and will give you a 

00:03:26.560 --> 00:03:31.510
 very beautiful graphic 

00:03:29.230 --> 00:03:35.049
 the controls of the game the controls are 

00:03:31.510 --> 00:03:38.380
 simple you can control tor 

00:03:35.049 --> 00:03:40.840
 just by clicking on some points on the screen 

00:03:38.380 --> 00:03:42.280
 You can only walk with him. 

00:03:40.840 --> 00:03:44.290
 clicking on the screen 

00:03:42.280 --> 00:03:45.340
 if you double click it will play 

00:03:44.290 --> 00:03:47.049
 the hammer 

00:03:45.340 --> 00:03:49.150
 you click once on your 

00:03:47.049 --> 00:03:52.389
 enemy touches him once he's gone 

00:03:49.150 --> 00:03:53.530
 attack the enemy very well as well 

00:03:52.389 --> 00:03:56.019
 interesting 

00:03:53.530 --> 00:03:59.230
 the controls felt it was worth it 

00:03:56.019 --> 00:04:02.440
 maintain this format element format 

00:03:59.230 --> 00:04:05.650
 rpg and you implying on screen and walking 

00:04:02.440 --> 00:04:09.220
 then it is an interesting control the 

00:04:05.650 --> 00:04:12.310
 allies and enemies and can select 

00:04:09.220 --> 00:04:15.069
 they screen the allies on non-enemies 

00:04:12.310 --> 00:04:17.590
 the allies and the warriors who are 

00:04:15.069 --> 00:04:19.539
 supporting you then you will only 

00:04:17.590 --> 00:04:20.440
 play as far as I can with your 

00:04:19.539 --> 00:04:22.570
 energy 

00:04:20.440 --> 00:04:26.380
 so you're just going to play 

00:04:22.570 --> 00:04:29.169
 screen and selecting it will ana 

00:04:26.380 --> 00:04:29.770
 warrior and lined up can be 

00:04:29.169 --> 00:04:32.280
 improved 

00:04:29.770 --> 00:04:34.870
 level 10 which further leaves 

00:04:32.280 --> 00:04:37.120
 interesting in some points if you 

00:04:34.870 --> 00:04:39.129
 have with infinite money or rack 

00:04:37.120 --> 00:04:41.889
 with the modified sin 

00:04:39.129 --> 00:04:44.979
 if you use all of them level 10 has 

00:04:41.889 --> 00:04:48.870
 point and make it more need to fight then 

00:04:44.979 --> 00:04:51.460
 this is sometimes not even make the game more 

00:04:48.870 --> 00:04:55.659
 uninteresting if you use a motorcycle and 

00:04:51.460 --> 00:04:58.300
 infinite money to the game is very big 

00:04:55.659 --> 00:05:01.030
 It's but how it was released recently. 

00:04:58.300 --> 00:05:04.990
 and still works on more 

00:05:01.030 --> 00:05:08.139
 old with android android 2.3 

00:05:04.990 --> 00:05:11.169
 it has in strength and stiffness of size and 

00:05:08.139 --> 00:05:14.229
 requires at least 1512 Ram 

00:05:11.169 --> 00:05:17.710
 maybe with 512 does not work very well 

00:05:14.229 --> 00:05:19.169
 but runs on 2.3 devices which is a 

00:05:17.710 --> 00:05:22.870
 advantage 

00:05:19.169 --> 00:05:28.930
 the device that this game was tested was 

00:05:22.870 --> 00:05:33.840
 the motorola razr xt 910 which is 1.2 ghz one 

00:05:28.930 --> 00:05:39.550
 Khor al processor AHETA android 

00:05:33.840 --> 00:05:41.319
 4.1.2 which is the original beauty version 

00:05:39.550 --> 00:05:43.900
 guys this was do not forget to 

00:05:41.319 --> 00:05:46.229
 evaluate the video here and until the next 

00:05:43.900 --> 00:05:46.229
 thanks
