00:00:11.710 --> 00:00:17.090
 hello here is the motto I bake 

00:00:15.320 --> 00:00:18.230
 finally a cake or 

00:00:17.090 --> 00:00:20.450
 I make it finally a 

00:00:18.230 --> 00:00:22.640
 to take a purchase and as a tutorial too 

00:00:20.450 --> 00:00:26.810
 I make that and I do it 

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:29.180
 this time a marzipan nougat place as 

00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:31.190
 dough as a basic day I do that again 

00:00:29.180 --> 00:00:32.900
 miracle recipe what you can now completely 

00:00:31.190 --> 00:00:38.030
 much forum is actually to be read 

00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:42.559
 consists of 4 200 sugar 200 milliliters 

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:45.199
 liquid namely the young 200 

00:00:42.559 --> 00:00:46.820
 milliliters of liquid could do it all 

00:00:45.199 --> 00:00:51.489
 possible next to york and a liter 

00:00:46.820 --> 00:00:54.769
 Buttermilch let you what you want 3 daniel 

00:00:51.489 --> 00:00:59.720
 and a pack of powder and came 

00:00:54.769 --> 00:01:25.000
 through so that I'll show you eggs here 

00:00:59.720 --> 00:01:25.000
 and sugar foamy nicely fluffy 

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:53.180
 right on the 1st 

00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:32.120
 if that with the future 

00:02:30.630 --> 00:02:36.280
 always hard 

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:36.280
 or not being hit like that anymore 

00:02:40.950 --> 00:02:43.610
 the voltage 

00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:46.360
 why this 

00:02:53.690 --> 00:02:56.020
 wag 

00:03:15.140 --> 00:03:18.800
 st 

00:03:16.960 --> 00:03:21.050
 space 

00:03:18.800 --> 00:03:23.050
 nobody 

00:03:21.050 --> 00:03:23.050
 O 

00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:56.890
 that means it finished the oven at 180 k 

00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:58.930
 differences not only 40 minutes to 

00:03:56.890 --> 00:04:01.329
 an hour so i would say 45 

00:03:58.930 --> 00:04:04.120
 minutes then comes to the oven 

00:04:01.329 --> 00:04:06.310
 out to so why always do 

00:04:04.120 --> 00:04:09.549
 make a sample you know that lifts him 

00:04:06.310 --> 00:04:14.639
 still beats in and indeed 

00:04:09.549 --> 00:04:14.639
 once outside once in sticks something else 

00:04:30.030 --> 00:04:38.760
 cut designed for exterior and 

00:04:36.160 --> 00:04:38.760
 intervened
