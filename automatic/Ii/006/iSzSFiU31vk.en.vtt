00:00:03.680 --> 00:00:10.830
 knitting shortened rows in those cases 

00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:14.549
 when we knit tuck 

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:20.160
 or swimsuit we need to knit 

00:00:14.549 --> 00:00:22.699
 the row is shorter than all the other rows and here 

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:25.980
 how can you do it beautifully 

00:00:22.699 --> 00:00:29.099
 so that you can see better i 

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:36.410
 knitted a shortened row of another 

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:38.730
 colors and then the right knit need not enter 

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:43.230
 the next loop you want 

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:47.039
 knit and 1 row lower and knit 

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:52.789
 In this case, the front loop as we 

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:57.719
 knit the front viscous and this loop 

00:00:52.789 --> 00:00:59.940
 transfer to the left knitting needle in this way 

00:00:57.719 --> 00:01:05.210
 to both loops 

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:07.200
 lay one way here so on 

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:17.760
 turn over and knit in another 

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:21.770
 Wrong side of the loop so I 

00:01:17.760 --> 00:01:26.460
 finished to the end now 

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:28.860
 turn over and knit again in another 

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:31.950
 side now i will knit 

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:35.820
 thread primary color to you 

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:39.180
 saw what a shortened row looks like 

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:43.830
 loops knit facial it with us 

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:47.370
 the front side and so I finished up that 

00:01:43.830 --> 00:01:50.520
 loop where we have two at once 

00:01:47.370 --> 00:01:56.100
 loops and knit them together now 

00:01:50.520 --> 00:02:01.730
 front loop and then knit a series of up to 

00:01:56.100 --> 00:02:05.730
 end so turned 

00:02:01.730 --> 00:02:09.810
 shortened row that is such 

00:02:05.730 --> 00:02:13.680
 tuck and at the same time in the place where we 

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:16.380
 the series ended with us turned out very 

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:21.090
 neat loop and there is no 

00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:24.360
 holes and so I knitted another row and 

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:27.290
 this sample shows that we have 

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:30.480
 knitting appeared two additional 

00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:31.050
 shortened series and so can 

00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:34.680
 to knit 

00:02:31.050 --> 00:02:38.340
 tucks number of shortened loops 

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:41.600
 can be any and so tuck 

00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:45.360
 can do more or less 

00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:46.770
 shortened rows can be knit the same way with 

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:52.410
 seamy side 

00:02:46.770 --> 00:02:56.070
 for this we need a needle from the purl 

00:02:52.410 --> 00:02:58.670
 sides on the front one row below here 

00:02:56.070 --> 00:03:03.420
 here and knit 

00:02:58.670 --> 00:03:06.840
 purl loop this loop throws 

00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:10.380
 on the left needle exactly the same 

00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:14.580
 direction as we have previous 

00:03:10.380 --> 00:03:18.780
 a loop that is like this 

00:03:14.580 --> 00:03:22.740
 It turns out 2 loops that lie in one 

00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:25.640
 direction depending on how 

00:03:22.740 --> 00:03:30.150
 the way you prefer to knit loops 

00:03:25.640 --> 00:03:33.060
 it may be slightly different but the most 

00:03:30.150 --> 00:03:36.630
 the main thing is to know the principle that the loop 

00:03:33.060 --> 00:03:39.650
 lay the same and then the next row 

00:03:36.630 --> 00:03:42.930
 they can be easily knit together and 

00:03:39.650 --> 00:03:49.440
 now turn the work to another 

00:03:42.930 --> 00:03:51.290
 side and continue knitting a row now 

00:03:49.440 --> 00:03:54.560
 On the other side 

00:03:51.290 --> 00:03:57.530
 face loops and we succeed 

00:03:54.560 --> 00:04:02.150
 shortened row 

00:03:57.530 --> 00:04:08.400
 the next row will knit 

00:04:02.150 --> 00:04:13.220
 already a big long row and these two loops 

00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:18.299
 we will knit together one loop and 

00:04:13.220 --> 00:04:22.310
 I'll show you how we do it. 

00:04:18.299 --> 00:04:22.310
 all loops now purl 

00:04:23.570 --> 00:04:29.810
 and where we have two loops is 

00:04:27.950 --> 00:04:34.220
 also knit 

00:04:29.810 --> 00:04:40.030
 purl one loop and then knit to 

00:04:34.220 --> 00:04:40.030
 the end of the row is already a full row 

00:04:40.330 --> 00:04:50.150
 this is a shortened row 

00:04:45.800 --> 00:04:55.040
 and here it is very clearly seen as not knitting 

00:04:50.150 --> 00:04:58.700
 thread a different color good people put 

00:04:55.040 --> 00:05:02.630
 likes and how do we know that did not work 

00:04:58.700 --> 00:05:06.610
 in vain and subscribe to new lessons 

00:05:02.630 --> 00:05:06.610
 and then miss the most interesting
