00:00:07.640 --> 00:00:13.200
 maximum recalculated at the biblical festival 

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:15.330
 this evening a great overview from 

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:17.580
 isacco to the prodigal son but then to the 

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:20.340
 end tells us we need wires 

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:22.380
 as a telemachus 

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:25.350
 we need all three because in 

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:29.070
 fund these three figures of children are 

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:33.050
 three figures of children saved because the 

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:36.480
 prodigal son is saved from forgiveness 

00:00:33.050 --> 00:00:38.670
 merciful of the father and in this 

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:40.050
 so let's say rectify the 

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:42.120
 representation that the child had 

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:44.340
 of the law that the law is only the place 

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:46.800
 the punishment of punishment is instead 

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:50.250
 shows that the law can be law 

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:52.680
 of telemachus love is saved by the father 

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:54.390
 who returns but the father returns thanks to the 

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:56.969
 fact that this son gets in 

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:59.820
 movement and through his journey 

00:00:56.969 --> 00:01:02.840
 makes possible return of the father e 

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:07.110
 Isaac and saved by the intervention of God 

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:08.850
 which separates the father's son e 

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:11.939
 allows 

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:15.210
 the sack of being abandoned in the 

00:01:11.939 --> 00:01:18.390
 desert and I can only lose it 

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:19.860
 very often she says that it is the gift more 

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:21.899
 big with father can have a child 

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:24.000
 also that of the testimony no that 

00:01:21.899 --> 00:01:26.670
 then it goes like saying reinterpreted of 

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:28.920
 lived we can say that the bible is the 

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:31.880
 witness gift for for values 

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:34.440
 who brings his father with him to his children 

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:37.860
 all yes there is no doubt there is the text 

00:01:34.440 --> 00:01:41.550
 biblical and rich in testimony and in 

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:43.440
 this text itself is a testimony 

00:01:41.550 --> 00:01:45.690
 when I use the word testimony 

00:01:43.440 --> 00:01:49.289
 undoubtedly there is a Christian echo in 

00:01:45.690 --> 00:01:52.530
 this is the verb that becomes flesh but more 

00:01:49.289 --> 00:01:55.649
 laically there is testimony when the 

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:59.130
 reads desire unites yes 

00:01:55.649 --> 00:02:02.690
 intertwine but not in rhetoric but 

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:02.690
 giving life a shape
