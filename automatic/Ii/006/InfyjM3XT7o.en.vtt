00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:28.339 
and I'm just gonna take my bombs okay so
basically<00:00:26.160> what<00:00:26.460> this<00:00:26.789> trick<00:00:27.090> does<00:00:27.330> is<00:00:27.720> it

00:00:28.339 --> 00:00:28.349 
basically what this trick does is it

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:32.179 
basically what this trick does is it
takes<00:00:28.740> you<00:00:29.070> and<00:00:29.960> it<00:00:30.960> puts<00:00:31.199> you<00:00:31.410> like<00:00:31.679> under<00:00:32.040> the

00:00:32.179 --> 00:00:32.189 
takes you and it puts you like under the

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:34.130 
takes you and it puts you like under the
ground<00:00:32.399> and<00:00:32.820> you<00:00:32.910> can<00:00:33.090> use<00:00:33.300> your<00:00:33.480> hook<00:00:33.630> shot<00:00:33.930> or

00:00:34.130 --> 00:00:34.140 
ground and you can use your hook shot or

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:36.740 
ground and you can use your hook shot or
bow<00:00:34.320> from<00:00:34.590> other<00:00:34.770> grounds<00:00:35.250> so<00:00:35.520> for<00:00:36.239> example

00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:36.750 
bow from other grounds so for example

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:39.260 
bow from other grounds so for example
you<00:00:36.930> can<00:00:37.050> shoot<00:00:37.350> the<00:00:37.680> thing<00:00:38.610> here<00:00:38.879> to<00:00:39.000> flip

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:39.270 
you can shoot the thing here to flip

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:44.049 
you can shoot the thing here to flip
stone<00:00:39.570> tower<00:00:39.840> without<00:00:40.200> moving<00:00:40.800> the<00:00:40.890> blocks<00:00:42.379> so

00:00:44.049 --> 00:00:44.059 
stone tower without moving the blocks so

00:00:44.059 --> 00:00:46.250 
stone tower without moving the blocks so
what<00:00:45.059> you<00:00:45.180> want<00:00:45.329> to<00:00:45.390> do<00:00:45.570> is<00:00:45.719> you<00:00:45.840> want<00:00:45.989> to<00:00:46.079> take

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:46.260 
what you want to do is you want to take

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:48.830 
what you want to do is you want to take
out<00:00:46.410> a<00:00:46.440> bomb<00:00:46.710> I'm<00:00:47.640> gonna<00:00:47.850> pause<00:00:48.120> in<00:00:48.390> between<00:00:48.690> so

00:00:48.830 --> 00:00:48.840 
out a bomb I'm gonna pause in between so

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:50.209 
out a bomb I'm gonna pause in between so
I<00:00:48.899> can<00:00:49.050> explain<00:00:49.350> it<00:00:49.530> so<00:00:49.649> you<00:00:49.739> want<00:00:49.890> to<00:00:49.950> take<00:00:50.070> out

00:00:50.209 --> 00:00:50.219 
I can explain it so you want to take out

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:52.340 
I can explain it so you want to take out
a<00:00:50.250> bomb<00:00:50.430> move<00:00:51.300> to<00:00:51.510> the<00:00:51.629> right<00:00:51.930> a<00:00:51.960> little<00:00:52.199> bit

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:52.350 
a bomb move to the right a little bit

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:55.100 
a bomb move to the right a little bit
and<00:00:52.739> then<00:00:53.730> you<00:00:53.850> want<00:00:54.030> to<00:00:54.059> press<00:00:54.329> hook<00:00:54.600> shot<00:00:54.870> and

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:55.110 
and then you want to press hook shot and

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:56.630 
and then you want to press hook shot and
then<00:00:55.230> shield<00:00:55.590> this<00:00:55.829> will<00:00:56.039> make<00:00:56.190> it<00:00:56.370> so<00:00:56.610> that

00:00:56.630 --> 00:00:56.640 
then shield this will make it so that

00:00:56.640 --> 00:00:59.209 
then shield this will make it so that
the<00:00:56.850> hook<00:00:57.000> shots<00:00:57.300> in<00:00:57.480> your<00:00:57.629> hand<00:00:57.930> but<00:00:58.320> you're

00:00:59.209 --> 00:00:59.219 
the hook shots in your hand but you're

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:01.549 
the hook shots in your hand but you're
not<00:00:59.430> like<00:00:59.850> actually<00:01:00.600> in<00:01:00.719> the<00:01:00.809> first-person

00:01:01.549 --> 00:01:01.559 
not like actually in the first-person

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:04.729 
not like actually in the first-person
mode<00:01:02.210> so<00:01:03.210> like<00:01:03.390> that<00:01:03.719> and<00:01:04.260> then<00:01:04.409> you<00:01:04.500> want<00:01:04.619> to

00:01:04.729 --> 00:01:04.739 
mode so like that and then you want to

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:07.820 
mode so like that and then you want to
time<00:01:05.040> it<00:01:05.250> so<00:01:05.659> so<00:01:06.659> you<00:01:06.720> roll<00:01:06.990> on<00:01:07.140> a<00:01:07.170> house<00:01:07.470> frame

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:07.830 
time it so so you roll on a house frame

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:09.800 
time it so so you roll on a house frame
I'll<00:01:08.549> probably<00:01:08.880> miss<00:01:09.090> it<00:01:09.150> this<00:01:09.360> time<00:01:09.600> because

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:09.810 
I'll probably miss it this time because

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:13.429 
I'll probably miss it this time because
I'm<00:01:09.960> in<00:01:10.080> becoming<00:01:10.439> frames<00:01:11.060> but<00:01:12.110> this<00:01:13.110> is<00:01:13.290> just

00:01:13.429 --> 00:01:13.439 
I'm in becoming frames but this is just

00:01:13.439 --> 00:01:15.200 
I'm in becoming frames but this is just
something<00:01:13.619> you<00:01:13.950> kind<00:01:14.159> of<00:01:14.189> have<00:01:14.310> to<00:01:14.340> feel<00:01:14.700> it's

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:15.210 
something you kind of have to feel it's

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:18.830 
something you kind of have to feel it's
like<00:01:15.360> I<00:01:16.490> usually<00:01:17.490> count<00:01:17.729> one<00:01:18.000> two<00:01:18.030> three<00:01:18.299> one

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:18.840 
like I usually count one two three one

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:21.499 
like I usually count one two three one
two<00:01:18.869> three<00:01:19.049> with<00:01:19.409> the<00:01:19.560> frames<00:01:19.970> because<00:01:20.970> it's<00:01:21.240> I

00:01:21.499 --> 00:01:21.509 
two three with the frames because it's I

00:01:21.509 --> 00:01:23.090 
two three with the frames because it's I
think<00:01:22.020> it's<00:01:22.140> just<00:01:22.290> a<00:01:22.409> little<00:01:22.530> bit<00:01:22.770> after<00:01:23.070> the

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:23.100 
think it's just a little bit after the

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:26.090 
think it's just a little bit after the
sixth<00:01:23.580> flash<00:01:23.939> is<00:01:24.900> the<00:01:25.290> frame<00:01:25.770> you<00:01:25.890> want<00:01:26.040> to

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:26.100 
sixth flash is the frame you want to

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:28.310 
sixth flash is the frame you want to
roll<00:01:26.250> on<00:01:26.369> so<00:01:26.820> I<00:01:27.090> probably<00:01:27.689> won't<00:01:27.900> get<00:01:28.049> at<00:01:28.200> this

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:28.320 
roll on so I probably won't get at this

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:30.410 
roll on so I probably won't get at this
try<00:01:28.560> but<00:01:28.799> I'll<00:01:29.159> do<00:01:29.430> it<00:01:29.460> in<00:01:29.579> real<00:01:29.759> time<00:01:29.820> again<00:01:30.299> if

00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:30.420 
try but I'll do it in real time again if

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:33.469 
try but I'll do it in real time again if
I<00:01:30.540> miss<00:01:30.750> it

00:01:33.469 --> 00:01:33.479 

00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:40.039 

okay<00:01:35.600> okay<00:01:36.649> so<00:01:37.649> I<00:01:37.979> think<00:01:38.189> I<00:01:38.549> got<00:01:38.759> it

00:01:40.039 --> 00:01:40.049 
okay okay so I think I got it

00:01:40.049 --> 00:01:43.490 
okay okay so I think I got it
so<00:01:40.890> what<00:01:41.009> I<00:01:41.039> did<00:01:41.159> is<00:01:41.610> I<00:01:41.780> paused<00:01:42.780> when<00:01:43.140> the<00:01:43.320> bomb

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:43.500 
so what I did is I paused when the bomb

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:45.050 
so what I did is I paused when the bomb
on<00:01:44.100> the<00:01:44.130> first<00:01:44.399> frame<00:01:44.640> that<00:01:44.820> the<00:01:44.880> bomb

00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:45.060 
on the first frame that the bomb

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:47.990 
on the first frame that the bomb
exploded<00:01:45.570> and<00:01:45.869> then<00:01:46.560> I<00:01:46.649> didn't<00:01:47.219> I<00:01:47.429> there<00:01:47.880> were

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:48.000 
exploded and then I didn't I there were

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:50.120 
exploded and then I didn't I there were
no<00:01:48.149> inputs<00:01:48.570> on<00:01:48.719> that<00:01:48.899> frame<00:01:49.110> now<00:01:49.710> this<00:01:49.860> is<00:01:49.979> the

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:50.130 
no inputs on that frame now this is the

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:52.910 
no inputs on that frame now this is the
second<00:01:50.520> frame<00:01:50.789> and<00:01:51.090> you<00:01:51.750> want<00:01:51.929> to<00:01:52.020> hold<00:01:52.259> left

00:01:52.910 --> 00:01:52.920 
second frame and you want to hold left

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:57.109 
second frame and you want to hold left
on<00:01:53.220> your<00:01:53.479> control<00:01:54.479> stick<00:01:54.720> and<00:01:55.670> pause<00:01:56.670> buffer

00:01:57.109 --> 00:01:57.119 
on your control stick and pause buffer

00:01:57.119 --> 00:02:01.450 
on your control stick and pause buffer
again<00:01:57.360> now<00:01:58.319> you<00:01:58.380> want<00:01:58.679> to<00:01:59.090> let<00:02:00.090> go<00:02:00.119> of<00:02:00.270> left<00:02:00.689> and

00:02:01.450 --> 00:02:01.460 
again now you want to let go of left and

00:02:01.460 --> 00:02:04.609 
again now you want to let go of left and
mash<00:02:02.460> the<00:02:03.000> hookshot<00:02:03.240> or<00:02:03.780> the<00:02:03.960> bow<00:02:04.110> depending

00:02:04.609 --> 00:02:04.619 
mash the hookshot or the bow depending

00:02:04.619 --> 00:02:05.510 
mash the hookshot or the bow depending
on<00:02:04.710> what<00:02:04.890> you're<00:02:05.069> doing

00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:05.520

buffered method but some people do it in

00:03:04.650 --> 00:03:05.990 
buffered method but some people do it in
real<00:03:04.829> time<00:03:04.889> but<00:03:05.220> that<00:03:05.370> takes<00:03:05.549> a<00:03:05.730> bunch<00:03:05.880> of

00:03:05.990 --> 00:03:06.000 
real time but that takes a bunch of

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:09.170 
real time but that takes a bunch of
practice<00:03:06.799> so<00:03:07.799> hope<00:03:08.489> that<00:03:08.670> helped
