00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:21.029
 code for firing a pistol 6 to 9 b 

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:24.060
 apply ordinary ammo to 

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:29.039
 Makarov pistol as you see the shop 

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:39.540
 these guns modified shop 

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:42.829
 inserted into the handle for loading 

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:42.829
 the shutter is retracted 

00:00:46.370 --> 00:00:57.320
 let go the trigger reduced gun ready 

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:57.320
 to shot 

00:01:05.020 --> 00:01:08.450
 The principle of suturing the shot is 

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:11.060
 next 

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:14.000
 in the barrel you drilled into a multitude 

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:16.009
 holes and bullets when firing passes 

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:19.220
 past these holes in series 

00:01:16.009 --> 00:01:22.130
 opening up each one with this exhaust 

00:01:19.220 --> 00:01:24.680
 It is not that solid and crushed it 

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:28.479
 in itself in three reduces the sound 

00:01:24.680 --> 00:01:30.740
 power on hot powder gases 

00:01:28.479 --> 00:01:32.930
 consistently comes out of these 

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:34.899
 holes outside the barrel when 

00:01:32.930 --> 00:01:37.880
 sequential extension 

00:01:34.899 --> 00:01:40.880
 hot gas its temperature drops 

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:45.050
 according to its volume and reduced 

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:47.899
 exhaust pressure to temperature 

00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:50.090
 gas decreased mood put on the network 

00:01:47.899 --> 00:01:52.850
 four lan which take over 

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:55.880
 hot gas temperature itself 

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:58.160
 heats up even more cooling hot 

00:01:55.880 --> 00:02:01.539
 exhaust gas pressure decreases 

00:01:58.160 --> 00:02:01.539
 all 8 times
