00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:22.560 
the only reason I do a sponsorship is if

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:24.800 
the only reason I do a sponsorship is if
I<00:01:22.950> really<00:01:23.310> truly<00:01:23.549> enjoy<00:01:24.000> a<00:01:24.030> product<00:01:24.600> and<00:01:24.750> I

I really truly enjoy a product and I

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:26.780 
I really truly enjoy a product and I
think<00:01:25.049> it's<00:01:25.229> actually<00:01:25.680> really<00:01:25.890> cool<00:01:26.189> and<00:01:26.490> I

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:26.790 
think it's actually really cool and I

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:28.700 
think it's actually really cool and I
was<00:01:26.939> like<00:01:27.119> I<00:01:27.240> would<00:01:27.570> totally<00:01:27.720> buy<00:01:28.080> this<00:01:28.140> even

if<00:01:28.829> I<00:01:29.040> wasn't<00:01:29.250> sponsored<00:01:29.820> and<00:01:30.119> I<00:01:30.299> think<00:01:30.570> that

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:30.750 
if I wasn't sponsored and I think that

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:32.569 
if I wasn't sponsored and I think that
my<00:01:31.170> viewers<00:01:31.530> would<00:01:31.560> really<00:01:31.950> like<00:01:32.130> it<00:01:32.280> that<00:01:32.310> is

00:01:32.569 --> 00:01:32.579

00:01:32.579 --> 00:01:34.999 
my viewers would really like it that is
the<00:01:32.729> only<00:01:33.000> reason<00:01:33.450> that's<00:01:34.439> the<00:01:34.500> only<00:01:34.740> time<00:01:34.950> I

00:01:34.999 --> 00:01:35.009 
the only reason that's the only time I

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:36.950 
the only reason that's the only time I
will<00:01:35.280> ever<00:01:35.310> do<00:01:35.610> sponsorships<00:01:35.880> is<00:01:36.479> if<00:01:36.810> I

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:36.960 
will ever do sponsorships is if I

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:39.080 
will ever do sponsorships is if I
actually<00:01:37.229> truly<00:01:38.130> like<00:01:38.369> it<00:01:38.520> i<00:01:38.610> will<00:01:38.759> never<00:01:38.970> show
