freeze<00:00:45.600> it's<00:00:45.809> not<00:00:45.960> too<00:00:46.200> hard<00:00:46.469> to<00:00:46.620> afford<00:00:46.680> them

00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:47.160 
freeze it's not too hard to afford them

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:49.970 
freeze it's not too hard to afford them
and<00:00:47.510> overall<00:00:48.510> if<00:00:48.690> you<00:00:48.870> mess<00:00:49.440> up<00:00:49.620> of<00:00:49.829> those

00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:49.980 
and overall if you mess up of those

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:51.560 
and overall if you mess up of those
tanks<00:00:50.340> it<00:00:50.460> doesn't<00:00:50.730> cost<00:00:50.879> you<00:00:51.090> too<00:00:51.210> much<00:00:51.390> to

00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:51.570 
tanks it doesn't cost you too much to

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:54.049 
tanks it doesn't cost you too much to
repair<00:00:51.870> them<00:00:52.110> so<00:00:52.770> I<00:00:52.800> would<00:00:52.949> say<00:00:53.160> following<00:00:53.879> the

00:00:54.049 --> 00:00:54.059 
repair them so I would say following the

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:56.270 
repair them so I would say following the
specials<00:00:54.539> in<00:00:54.780> the<00:00:54.809> in<00:00:55.410> the<00:00:55.590> front<00:00:55.739> page<00:00:56.039> of<00:00:56.190> all

00:00:56.270 --> 00:00:56.280 
specials in the in the front page of all

00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:57.799 
specials in the in the front page of all
the<00:00:56.430> tanks<00:00:56.730> is<00:00:56.820> definitely<00:00:57.210> very<00:00:57.239> important

00:00:57.799 --> 00:00:57.809 
the tanks is definitely very important

00:00:57.809 --> 00:01:00.770 
the tanks is definitely very important
and<00:00:58.050> another<00:00:58.829> thing<00:00:59.219> which<00:00:59.460> is<00:00:59.489> a<00:00:59.789> little<00:01:00.690> less

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:00.780 
and another thing which is a little less

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:02.420 
and another thing which is a little less
efficient<00:01:01.320> but<00:01:01.440> could<00:01:01.590> work<00:01:01.739> to<00:01:01.920> use<00:01:02.010> top<00:01:02.280> of

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:02.430 
efficient but could work to use top of

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:05.329 
efficient but could work to use top of
the<00:01:02.550> tree<00:01:03.019> basically<00:01:04.019> tier<00:01:04.350> 10<00:01:04.589> tier<00:01:04.830> 9<00:01:05.100> and

00:01:05.329 --> 00:01:05.339 
the tree basically tier 10 tier 9 and

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:08.330 
the tree basically tier 10 tier 9 and
tier<00:01:05.519> 8<00:01:05.640> tanks<00:01:06.090> of<00:01:06.360> certain<00:01:07.200> Nations<00:01:07.710> every

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:08.340 
tier 8 tanks of certain Nations every

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:10.840 
tier 8 tanks of certain Nations every
month<00:01:08.670> I<00:01:08.970> think<00:01:09.299> they<00:01:09.570> will<00:01:09.720> get<00:01:09.930> a<00:01:10.200> bonus

00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:10.850 
month I think they will get a bonus

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:15.140 
month I think they will get a bonus
basically<00:01:11.850> by<00:01:12.659> 30%<00:01:13.049> discount<00:01:13.530> and<00:01:14.040> 30%<00:01:14.700> more

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:15.150 
basically by 30% discount and 30% more

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:17.600 
basically by 30% discount and 30% more
credits<00:01:15.720> earned<00:01:15.900> so<00:01:16.500> that<00:01:16.770> is<00:01:16.890> another<00:01:17.189> way<00:01:17.430> on

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:17.610 
credits earned so that is another way on

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:18.920 
credits earned so that is another way on
how<00:01:17.759> you<00:01:17.820> can<00:01:17.970> money<00:01:18.180> make<00:01:18.390> this<00:01:18.570> one<00:01:18.780> is<00:01:18.900> a

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:18.930 
how you can money make this one is a

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:20.870 
how you can money make this one is a
little<00:01:19.080> more<00:01:19.320> tough<00:01:19.530> though<00:01:19.799> because<00:01:20.729> it

00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:20.880 
little more tough though because it

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:23.149 
little more tough though because it
really<00:01:21.060> depends<00:01:21.390> what<00:01:21.720> tanks<00:01:22.229> are<00:01:22.409> on<00:01:22.680> the<00:01:22.979> top

00:01:23.149 --> 00:01:23.159 
really depends what tanks are on the top

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:25.550 
really depends what tanks are on the top
of<00:01:23.310> the<00:01:23.430> tree<00:01:23.810> now<00:01:24.810> the<00:01:24.869> second<00:01:25.259> way<00:01:25.350> how<00:01:25.500> you

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:25.560 
of the tree now the second way how you

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:27.649 
of the tree now the second way how you
might<00:01:25.830> make<00:01:26.130> is<00:01:26.369> go<00:01:26.880> to<00:01:26.939> the<00:01:27.150> side<00:01:27.390> that<00:01:27.570> I

00:01:27.649 --> 00:01:27.659 
might make is go to the side that I

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:30.350 
might make is go to the side that I

00:01:46.870 --> 00:01:46.880 
is subtracted by stuff like repairs

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:50.749 
is subtracted by stuff like repairs
damage<00:01:47.880> that<00:01:48.000> you've<00:01:48.180> taken<00:01:48.439> shells<00:01:49.759> modules

00:01:50.749 --> 00:01:50.759 
damage that you've taken shells modules

00:01:50.759 --> 00:01:55.370 
damage that you've taken shells modules
or<00:01:51.299> equipment<00:01:51.840> and<00:01:53.060> basically<00:01:54.060> it<00:01:54.780> gives<00:01:55.170> you

00:01:55.370 --> 00:01:55.380 
or equipment and basically it gives you

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:57.469 
or equipment and basically it gives you
the<00:01:55.530> final<00:01:55.770> number<00:01:56.369> by<00:01:56.759> when<00:01:57.210> it<00:01:57.329> gets

00:01:57.469 --> 00:01:57.479 
the final number by when it gets

00:01:57.479 --> 00:02:00.319 
the final number by when it gets
subtracted<00:01:57.860> so<00:01:58.860> in<00:01:59.070> this<00:01:59.189> case<00:01:59.490> the<00:01:59.790> most<00:02:00.090> net

00:02:00.319 --> 00:02:00.329 
subtracted so in this case the most net

00:02:00.329 --> 00:02:02.929 
subtracted so in this case the most net
in<00:02:00.509> the<00:02:00.930> highest<00:02:01.229> net<00:02:01.380> income<00:02:01.740> vehicles<00:02:02.159> fv304

00:02:02.929 --> 00:02:02.939 
in the highest net income vehicles fv304

00:02:02.939 --> 00:02:08.419 
in the highest net income vehicles fv304
with<00:02:03.920> 7000<00:02:04.920> credits<00:02:05.549> per<00:02:06.290> 25,000<00:02:07.290> bowels<00:02:07.710> so

00:02:08.419 --> 00:02:08.429 
with 7000 credits per 25,000 bowels so

00:02:08.429 --> 00:02:10.369 
with 7000 credits per 25,000 bowels so
this<00:02:08.580> is<00:02:08.729> a<00:02:08.759> very<00:02:09.030> accurate<00:02:09.300> average<00:02:09.929> number

00:02:10.369 --> 00:02:10.379 
this is a very accurate average number

00:02:10.379 --> 00:02:12.350 
this is a very accurate average number
of<00:02:10.410> how<00:02:10.770> much<00:02:11.009> you<00:02:11.160> can<00:02:11.280> expect<00:02:11.520> and<00:02:12.150> make

00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:12.360 
of how much you can expect and make

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:13.559 
of how much you can expect and make
without<00:02:12.569> a<00:02:12.720> premium

00:02:13.559 --> 00:02:13.569 
without a premium

without a premium
on<00:02:14.459> fv304<00:02:15.540> now<00:02:16.540> the<00:02:16.599> reason<00:02:16.959> why<00:02:17.079> stuff<00:02:17.560> like

00:02:17.699 --> 00:02:17.709 
on fv304 now the reason why stuff like

00:02:17.709 --> 00:02:20.250 
on fv304 now the reason why stuff like
FV<00:02:18.099> and<00:02:18.219> Bishop<00:02:18.609> are<00:02:18.819> at<00:02:19.150> number<00:02:19.420> one<00:02:19.780> places

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:20.260 
FV and Bishop are at number one places

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:22.619 
FV and Bishop are at number one places
is<00:02:20.409> because<00:02:20.769> artilleries<00:02:21.400> january<00:02:21.909> 10<00:02:22.180> not<00:02:22.450> to

00:02:22.619 --> 00:02:22.629 
is because artilleries january 10 not to

00:02:22.629 --> 00:02:24.240 
is because artilleries january 10 not to
die<00:02:22.780> so<00:02:23.049> often<00:02:23.469> because<00:02:23.769> they<00:02:23.920> just<00:02:24.040> sit<00:02:24.219> on

00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:24.250 
die so often because they just sit on

00:02:24.250 --> 00:02:28.860 
die so often because they just sit on
the<00:02:24.459> back<00:02:24.609> of<00:02:24.790> the<00:02:24.909> spawn<00:02:26.159> and<00:02:27.159> for<00:02:28.150> example<00:02:28.390> FV

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:28.870 
the back of the spawn and for example FV

00:02:28.870 --> 00:02:30.839 
the back of the spawn and for example FV
it<00:02:29.019> has<00:02:29.170> a<00:02:29.200> very<00:02:29.500> fast<00:02:29.709> firing<00:02:30.189> gun<00:02:30.400> that<00:02:30.670> has<00:02:30.819> a

00:02:30.839 --> 00:02:30.849 
it has a very fast firing gun that has a

00:02:30.849 --> 00:02:34.619 
it has a very fast firing gun that has a
very<00:02:31.209> high<00:02:31.859> accuracy<00:02:32.859> values<00:02:33.489> so<00:02:34.060> it

00:02:34.619 --> 00:02:34.629 
very high accuracy values so it

00:02:34.629 --> 00:02:37.140 
very high accuracy values so it
generally<00:02:35.409> makes<00:02:35.709> a<00:02:35.890> lot<00:02:36.040> of<00:02:36.069> sense<00:02:36.430> why<00:02:36.760> those

00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:37.150 
generally makes a lot of sense why those

00:02:37.150 --> 00:02:39.960 
generally makes a lot of sense why those
vehicles<00:02:37.659> get<00:02:37.900> a<00:02:38.049> lot<00:02:38.349> of<00:02:38.560> credit<00:02:39.310> incomes<00:02:39.819> and

00:02:39.960 --> 00:02:39.970 
vehicles get a lot of credit incomes and

00:02:39.970 --> 00:02:41.309 
vehicles get a lot of credit incomes and
probably<00:02:40.299> the<00:02:40.389> most<00:02:40.540> important<00:02:41.049> thing<00:02:41.230> about

00:02:41.309 --> 00:02:41.319 
probably the most important thing about

00:02:41.319 --> 00:02:43.110 
probably the most important thing about
artilleries<00:02:41.950> is<00:02:42.099> that<00:02:42.280> they<00:02:42.489> also<00:02:42.760> get

00:02:43.110 --> 00:02:43.120 
artilleries is that they also get

00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:44.670 
artilleries is that they also get
increased<00:02:43.780> credits

00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:44.680 
increased credits

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:47.250 
increased credits
I<00:02:44.709> think<00:02:45.340> it's<00:02:45.459> 200%<00:02:46.329> that<00:02:46.599> they<00:02:46.780> actually<00:02:46.900> get

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:47.260 
I think it's 200% that they actually get

00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:49.589 
I think it's 200% that they actually get
from<00:02:47.560> tanks<00:02:47.950> like<00:02:48.069> heavies<00:02:48.400> so<00:02:49.120> you<00:02:49.180> will

00:02:49.589 --> 00:02:49.599 
from tanks like heavies so you will

00:02:49.599 --> 00:02:51.420 
from tanks like heavies so you will
actually<00:02:49.840> get<00:02:50.200> increased<00:02:50.709> income<00:02:51.099> values

00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:51.430 
actually get increased income values

00:02:51.430 --> 00:02:53.670 
actually get increased income values
from<00:02:51.639> that<00:02:51.780> same<00:02:52.780> Abishai<00:02:53.169> here<00:02:53.470> in<00:02:53.560> our

00:02:53.670 --> 00:02:53.680 
from that same Abishai here in our

00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:56.940 
from that same Abishai here in our
Panzer<00:02:54.040> 4<00:02:54.310> and<00:02:54.639> Nassau<00:02:55.180> or<00:02:55.209> Nelson<00:02:55.750> gets<00:02:56.349> 150

00:02:56.940 --> 00:02:56.950 
Panzer 4 and Nassau or Nelson gets 150

00:02:56.950 --> 00:02:59.670 
Panzer 4 and Nassau or Nelson gets 150
increased<00:02:57.459> credits<00:02:58.030> hundred<00:02:58.989> fifty<00:02:59.349> percent

00:02:59.670 --> 00:02:59.680 
increased credits hundred fifty percent

00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:01.319 
increased credits hundred fifty percent
increased<00:03:00.040> credit<00:03:00.370> value<00:03:00.730> so<00:03:01.000> you<00:03:01.060> do

00:03:01.319 --> 00:03:01.329 
increased credit value so you do

00:03:01.329 --> 00:03:03.420 
increased credit value so you do
actually<00:03:01.659> might<00:03:02.049> make<00:03:02.079> a<00:03:02.590> very<00:03:02.859> fair<00:03:03.159> amount

00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:03.430 
actually might make a very fair amount

00:03:03.430 --> 00:03:06.210 
actually might make a very fair amount
of<00:03:03.549> Nashorn<00:03:04.030> -<00:03:04.180> so<00:03:04.569> if<00:03:05.260> you<00:03:05.379> do<00:03:05.560> I<00:03:05.829> would<00:03:05.889> say

00:03:06.210 --> 00:03:06.220 
of Nashorn - so if you do I would say

00:03:06.220 --> 00:03:08.069 
of Nashorn - so if you do I would say
the<00:03:06.400> best<00:03:06.760> vehicle<00:03:07.269> to<00:03:07.299> money<00:03:07.599> make<00:03:07.810> if<00:03:07.959> you

00:03:08.069 --> 00:03:08.079 
the best vehicle to money make if you

00:03:08.079 --> 00:03:10.409 
the best vehicle to money make if you
don't<00:03:08.260> like<00:03:08.379> artillery<00:03:08.889> is<00:03:08.950> nassau<00:03:09.400> and<00:03:09.430> so<00:03:09.819> go

00:03:10.409 --> 00:03:10.419 
don't like artillery is nassau and so go

00:03:10.419 --> 00:03:11.610 
don't like artillery is nassau and so go
