so if you're using them and you want
good<00:02:52.299> quality<00:02:52.720> transmission<00:02:53.379> make<00:02:54.040> sure<00:02:54.190> you

00:02:54.300 --> 00:02:54.310 
good quality transmission make sure you

00:02:54.310 --> 00:02:57.299 
good quality transmission make sure you
keep<00:02:54.489> the<00:02:54.640> antennas<00:02:55.120> up
