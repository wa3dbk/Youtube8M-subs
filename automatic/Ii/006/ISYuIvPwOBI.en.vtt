little<00:00:37.920> bit<00:00:38.010> better<00:00:38.129> now<00:00:38.940> personally<00:00:39.510> my<00:00:39.840> main

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:40.350 
little bit better now personally my main

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:41.660 
little bit better now personally my main
complaint<00:00:40.710> is<00:00:40.980> that<00:00:41.040> it's<00:00:41.399> a<00:00:41.640> little

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:41.670 
complaint is that it's a little

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:45.080 
complaint is that it's a little
uncomfortable<00:00:42.680> now<00:00:43.680> I<00:00:43.710> believe<00:00:44.100> if<00:00:44.610> I<00:00:44.730> would

00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:45.090 
uncomfortable now I believe if I would

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:46.700 
uncomfortable now I believe if I would
have<00:00:45.180> got<00:00:45.300> the<00:00:45.450> smaller<00:00:45.840> version<00:00:46.260> of<00:00:46.379> this<00:00:46.500> it

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:46.710 
have got the smaller version of this it

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:48.950 
have got the smaller version of this it
would<00:00:46.950> have<00:00:47.070> fit<00:00:47.280> a<00:00:47.309> lot<00:00:47.670> better<00:00:48.000> and<00:00:48.600> it<00:00:48.750> also

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:48.960 
would have fit a lot better and it also

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:51.200 
would have fit a lot better and it also
takes<00:00:49.379> a<00:00:49.590> while<00:00:49.770> to<00:00:49.980> fit<00:00:50.219> them<00:00:50.399> into<00:00:50.579> your<00:00:50.879> ear

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:51.210 
takes a while to fit them into your ear

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:53.240 
takes a while to fit them into your ear
let<00:00:51.719> me<00:00:51.840> taking<00:00:52.140> these<00:00:52.230> on<00:00:52.530> and<00:00:52.680> off<00:00:52.860> quite
