checked<00:03:10.579> both<00:03:10.909> of<00:03:11.269> the<00:03:11.420> PCV<00:03:12.290> lines<00:03:12.739> a<00:03:13.540> couple

00:03:14.530 --> 00:03:14.540 
checked both of the PCV lines a couple

00:03:14.540 --> 00:03:18.220 
checked both of the PCV lines a couple
of<00:03:14.629> the<00:03:14.689> sensors<00:03:15.230> and<00:03:15.980> they<00:03:16.689> we<00:03:17.689> have<00:03:17.840> actually

00:03:18.220 --> 00:03:18.230 
of the sensors and they we have actually

00:03:18.230 --> 00:03:20.199 
of the sensors and they we have actually
checked<00:03:18.469> the<00:03:18.590> intake<00:03:19.069> manifold<00:03:19.670> gasket

00:03:20.199 --> 00:03:20.209 
checked the intake manifold gasket

00:03:20.209 --> 00:03:21.429 
checked the intake manifold gasket
though<00:03:20.359> and<00:03:20.569> that's<00:03:20.659> what<00:03:20.900> I'm<00:03:20.989> thinking<00:03:21.349> it

00:03:21.429 --> 00:03:21.439 
though and that's what I'm thinking it

00:03:21.439 --> 00:03:25.449 
though and that's what I'm thinking it
is<00:03:22.750> but<00:03:23.750> I<00:03:24.170> want<00:03:24.439> to<00:03:24.530> make<00:03:24.650> sure<00:03:24.680> for<00:03:25.310> real

00:03:25.449 --> 00:03:25.459 
is but I want to make sure for real

00:03:25.459 --> 00:03:28.660 
is but I want to make sure for real
because<00:03:26.349> it<00:03:27.349> only<00:03:27.530> happens<00:03:28.010> once<00:03:28.250> it<00:03:28.430> gets<00:03:28.549> up

00:03:28.660 --> 00:03:28.670 
because it only happens once it gets up

00:03:28.670 --> 00:03:30.039 
because it only happens once it gets up
to<00:03:28.730> operating<00:03:29.180> temperature<00:03:29.269> it<00:03:29.750> does<00:03:29.870> not

00:03:30.039 --> 00:03:30.049 
to operating temperature it does not

00:03:30.049 --> 00:03:33.330 
to operating temperature it does not
make<00:03:30.349> this<00:03:30.560> noise<00:03:30.920> when<00:03:31.370> it<00:03:31.489> reform<00:03:31.879> enough

00:03:33.330 --> 00:03:33.340 
make this noise when it reform enough

00:03:33.340 --> 00:03:52.040 
make this noise when it reform enough
one<00:03:34.340> more<00:03:34.489> time<00:03:34.730> out<00:03:35.329> of<00:03:35.510> the<00:03:35.569> wind

00:03:52.040 --> 00:03:52.050 

00:03:52.050 --> 00:03:54.440 

that's<00:03:52.440> 99%<00:03:52.980> sure<00:03:53.400> a<00:03:53.550> vacuum<00:03:54.060> leak<00:03:54.180> there<00:03:54.420> I

00:03:54.440 --> 00:03:54.450 
that's 99% sure a vacuum leak there I

00:03:54.450 --> 00:03:56.380 
that's 99% sure a vacuum leak there I
just<00:03:54.690> want<00:03:54.840> to<00:03:54.930> make<00:03:55.050> sure<00:03:55.080> what<00:03:55.440> it<00:03:55.560> is<00:03:55.590> anyway

00:03:56.380 --> 00:03:56.390 
just want to make sure what it is anyway

00:03:56.390 --> 00:03:59.690 
just want to make sure what it is anyway
thank<00:03:57.390> you<00:03:57.450> for<00:03:57.540> watching
