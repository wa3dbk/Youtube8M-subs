 of the car we leave the original sound 

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:34.559
 so you can hear clearly 

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:37.320
 all indications of change of 

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:39.540
 rail alerts police cars radar 

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:42.090
 stopped on the shoulder and the continuous 

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:44.399
 changes of route we were wrong to leave 

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:46.739
 sometime to make them look as 

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:48.780
 fast and want to see us 

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:51.210
 We were wrong to ever leave so that 

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:53.420
 read the rapids that changes the route what 

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:53.420
 make 

00:03:00.890 --> 00:03:05.630
 as you have seen the navigation as 

00:03:03.319 --> 00:03:07.400
 is very comfortable allows options like 

00:03:05.630 --> 00:03:09.260
 add an intermediate stop and it's 

00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:11.810
 constantly looking for more routes 

00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:13.819
 fast or traffic on our route if you 

00:03:11.810 --> 00:03:15.890
 finds will tell us to take such a shortcut 

00:03:13.819 --> 00:03:17.840
 because there is traffic simply 

00:03:15.890 --> 00:03:20.420
 recalculate to our estimated time 

00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:22.700
 of arrival in addition to the expenditure of 

00:03:20.420 --> 00:03:24.920
 We are happy we have made a battery 

00:03:22.700 --> 00:03:27.140
 20 minutes journey with volume 

00:03:24.920 --> 00:03:29.510

00:03:27.140 --> 00:03:31.840
