00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:32.230 

00:02:32.230 --> 00:02:36.130 

so<00:02:33.230> just<00:02:33.530> take<00:02:33.740> it<00:02:33.770> close<00:02:34.550> to<00:02:34.580> the<00:02:34.880> to<00:02:35.810> the<00:02:35.840> leap

00:02:36.130 --> 00:02:36.140 
so just take it close to the to the leap

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:40.270 
so just take it close to the to the leap
and<00:02:36.350> give<00:02:36.980> it<00:02:37.010> a<00:02:37.160> snap<00:02:38.680> it's<00:02:39.680> pretty<00:02:39.860> easy<00:02:40.100> to

00:02:40.270 --> 00:02:40.280 
and give it a snap it's pretty easy to

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:41.860 
and give it a snap it's pretty easy to
process<00:02:40.610> this<00:02:41.060> then<00:02:41.300> we're<00:02:41.390> going<00:02:41.480> to<00:02:41.540> take<00:02:41.750> it

00:02:41.860 --> 00:02:41.870 
process this then we're going to take it

00:02:41.870 --> 00:02:43.270 
process this then we're going to take it
inside<00:02:42.230> and<00:02:42.380> I'm<00:02:42.500> going<00:02:42.650> to<00:02:42.710> get<00:02:42.860> it<00:02:42.950> ready<00:02:43.100> to

00:02:43.270 --> 00:02:43.280 
inside and I'm going to get it ready to

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:45.040 
inside and I'm going to get it ready to
go<00:02:43.310> in<00:02:43.520> the<00:02:43.610> freezer<00:02:43.850> because<00:02:44.540> that's<00:02:44.870> my

00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:45.050 
go in the freezer because that's my

00:02:45.050 --> 00:02:48.100 
go in the freezer because that's my
favorite<00:02:45.470> way<00:02:45.590> to<00:02:45.620> process<00:02:46.190> rhubarb<00:02:46.610> I<00:02:47.540> have

00:02:48.100 --> 00:02:48.110 
favorite way to process rhubarb I have

00:02:48.110 --> 00:02:51.100 
favorite way to process rhubarb I have
never<00:02:48.380> tried<00:02:48.710> to<00:02:48.860> dehydrate<00:02:49.430> it<00:02:49.870> but<00:02:50.870> i<00:02:50.900> have

00:02:51.100 --> 00:02:51.110 
never tried to dehydrate it but i have

00:02:51.110 --> 00:02:53.200 
never tried to dehydrate it but i have
always<00:02:51.230> frozen<00:02:51.650> it<00:02:52.010> and<00:02:52.370> i've<00:02:52.490> never<00:02:52.760> tried<00:02:53.000> to

00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:53.210 
always frozen it and i've never tried to

00:02:53.210 --> 00:02:56.410 
always frozen it and i've never tried to
can<00:02:53.450> it<00:02:53.720> I<00:02:54.340> honestly<00:02:55.340> don't<00:02:55.820> think<00:02:55.970> that<00:02:56.300> it's

00:02:56.410 --> 00:02:56.420 
can it I honestly don't think that it's

00:02:56.420 --> 00:02:58.090 
can it I honestly don't think that it's
very<00:02:56.510> conducive<00:02:57.050> to<00:02:57.290> canning<00:02:57.770> because<00:02:58.070> I

00:02:58.090 --> 00:02:58.100 
very conducive to canning because I

00:02:58.100 --> 00:02:59.410 
very conducive to canning because I
think<00:02:58.430> it<00:02:58.550> would<00:02:58.700> break<00:02:58.850> down<00:02:59.060> the<00:02:59.210> cell

00:02:59.410 --> 00:02:59.420 
think it would break down the cell

00:02:59.420 --> 00:03:00.730 
think it would break down the cell
structure<00:02:59.720> and<00:02:59.990> I<00:03:00.080> don't<00:03:00.290> think<00:03:00.530> that<00:03:00.650> it

00:03:00.730 --> 00:03:00.740 
structure and I don't think that it

00:03:00.740 --> 00:03:03.190 
structure and I don't think that it
would<00:03:00.830> be<00:03:00.980> very<00:03:01.130> good<00:03:01.400> at<00:03:01.520> all<00:03:01.720> these<00:03:02.720> might<00:03:03.080> be

00:03:03.190 --> 00:03:03.200 
would be very good at all these might be

00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:06.340 
would be very good at all these might be
too<00:03:03.410> skinny<00:03:03.740> but<00:03:04.010> that's<00:03:04.040> okay<00:03:05.140> all<00:03:06.140> right

00:03:06.340 --> 00:03:06.350 
too skinny but that's okay all right

00:03:06.350 --> 00:03:07.810 
too skinny but that's okay all right
we're<00:03:06.620> gonna<00:03:06.709> take<00:03:06.920> these<00:03:07.070> in<00:03:07.250> the<00:03:07.310> house<00:03:07.459> wash

00:03:07.810 --> 00:03:07.820

scrubbed it and then I cut both ends off

00:03:17.810 --> 00:03:19.990 
scrubbed it and then I cut both ends off
to<00:03:18.650> where<00:03:18.830> they<00:03:18.950> were<00:03:19.010> nice<00:03:19.250> and<00:03:19.280> clean<00:03:19.760> and

to where they were nice and clean and
then<00:03:20.270> I<00:03:20.300> put<00:03:20.570> it<00:03:20.660> back<00:03:20.870> in<00:03:21.050> the<00:03:21.080> sink<00:03:21.410> and<00:03:21.560> I<00:03:22.160> ran

then I put it back in the sink and I ran

00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:24.280 
then I put it back in the sink and I ran

00:03:30.699 --> 00:03:30.709 
it about half inch or so it doesn't have

00:05:37.190 --> 00:05:37.200 
taxes or tariffs on vegetables were

00:05:37.200 --> 00:05:38.660 
taxes or tariffs on vegetables were
higher<00:05:37.410> than<00:05:37.440> they<00:05:37.680> were<00:05:37.800> for<00:05:38.100> fruit<00:05:38.280> so<00:05:38.520> the

00:05:38.660 --> 00:05:38.670 
higher than they were for fruit so the

00:05:38.670 --> 00:05:40.610 
higher than they were for fruit so the
court<00:05:38.880> said<00:05:39.120> nope<00:05:39.270> remember<00:05:39.810> is<00:05:39.870> a<00:05:39.930> fruit<00:05:40.140> so

00:05:40.610 --> 00:05:40.620 
court said nope remember is a fruit so

00:05:40.620 --> 00:05:42.230 
court said nope remember is a fruit so
we<00:05:40.950> don't<00:05:41.040> have<00:05:41.190> to<00:05:41.310> pay<00:05:41.430> as<00:05:41.550> much<00:05:41.580> tax<00:05:41.970> on<00:05:42.150> it

00:05:42.230 --> 00:05:42.240 
we don't have to pay as much tax on it

00:05:42.240 --> 00:05:46.490 
we don't have to pay as much tax on it
and<00:05:42.390> then<00:05:43.050> I'm<00:05:43.320> earlier<00:05:44.100> I<00:05:45.260> alluded<00:05:46.260> to<00:05:46.320> the

00:05:46.490 --> 00:05:46.500 
and then I'm earlier I alluded to the

00:05:46.500 --> 00:05:49.400 
and then I'm earlier I alluded to the
fact<00:05:46.530> that<00:05:46.890> the<00:05:47.010> leaves<00:05:47.430> contain<00:05:48.410> oxacillin

00:05:49.400 --> 00:05:49.410

the<00:05:54.060> the<00:05:54.630> words<00:05:54.840> the<00:05:55.320> leaves<00:05:55.620> actually

00:05:56.680 --> 00:05:56.690 
the the words the leaves actually

00:05:56.690 --> 00:05:59.870 
the the words the leaves actually
contain<00:05:57.690> um<00:05:58.280> and<00:05:59.280> I'm<00:05:59.430> going<00:05:59.610> to<00:05:59.670> have<00:05:59.850> to

00:06:16.310 --> 00:06:16.320 
the leaves in order to have like

00:06:16.320 --> 00:06:18.740 
the leaves in order to have like
poisonous<00:06:17.040> effects<00:06:17.430> some<00:06:17.790> people<00:06:18.120> are<00:06:18.360> more

00:06:18.750 --> 00:06:21.220 
poisonous effects some people are more
sensitive<00:06:18.990> than<00:06:19.230> others<00:06:19.620> but<00:06:20.220> it<00:06:20.430> is<00:06:20.550> just<00:06:20.790> a

00:06:21.220 --> 00:06:21.230 
sensitive than others but it is just a

00:06:21.230 --> 00:06:24.260 
sensitive than others but it is just a
good<00:06:22.230> idea<00:06:22.500> to<00:06:22.680> stay<00:06:22.890> away<00:06:23.100> from<00:06:23.270> consuming

00:06:24.260 --> 00:06:24.270 
good idea to stay away from consuming

00:06:24.270 --> 00:06:26.720 
good idea to stay away from consuming
the<00:06:24.390> leaves<00:06:24.600> at<00:06:24.810> all<00:06:24.980> they<00:06:25.980> are<00:06:26.160> used<00:06:26.520> in

prescription<00:06:35.610> so<00:06:35.850> I<00:06:35.880> thought<00:06:36.060> that<00:06:36.240> was<00:06:36.360> kind

00:06:36.530 --> 00:06:36.540 
prescription so I thought that was kind

00:06:36.540 --> 00:06:40.610 
prescription so I thought that was kind
of<00:06:36.600> cool<00:06:36.660> um<00:06:37.110> and<00:06:38.330> then<00:06:39.330> the<00:06:39.450> last<00:06:39.630> thing<00:06:39.870> which

00:06:40.610 --> 00:06:40.620 
of cool um and then the last thing which

00:06:40.620 --> 00:06:42.350 
of cool um and then the last thing which
I<00:06:40.770> thought<00:06:40.980> was<00:06:41.340> interesting<00:06:41.580> you<00:06:42.000> may<00:06:42.150> or<00:06:42.270> may

I thought was interesting you may or may
not<00:06:42.390> know<00:06:42.570> rhubarb<00:06:43.470> is<00:06:43.680> actually<00:06:44.280> a<00:06:44.430> rhizome

00:06:45.140 --> 00:06:45.150 
not know rhubarb is actually a rhizome

00:06:45.150 --> 00:06:48.470 
not know rhubarb is actually a rhizome
so<00:06:45.750> it<00:06:46.100> reproduces<00:06:47.100> through<00:06:47.340> its<00:06:47.460> root<00:06:47.730> very

00:06:48.470 --> 00:06:48.480 
so it reproduces through its root very

00:06:48.480 --> 00:06:52.670 
so it reproduces through its root very
much<00:06:48.780> similar<00:06:49.020> to<00:06:49.260> ginger<00:06:50.180> or<00:06:51.180> asparagus<00:06:51.750> so

00:06:52.670 --> 00:06:52.680 
much similar to ginger or asparagus so

00:06:52.680 --> 00:06:55.100 
much similar to ginger or asparagus so
those<00:06:53.250> are<00:06:53.490> some<00:06:53.520> fun<00:06:53.880> facts<00:06:54.150> about<00:06:54.300> rhubarb<00:06:54.840> I
