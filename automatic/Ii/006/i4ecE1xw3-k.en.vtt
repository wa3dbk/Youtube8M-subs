00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:48.850 
and what are your thoughts well my

00:00:48.850 --> 00:00:50.700 
and what are your thoughts well my
thoughts<00:00:49.059> are<00:00:49.360> that<00:00:49.420> I<00:00:49.690> think<00:00:50.110> that<00:00:50.290> people

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:50.710 
thoughts are that I think that people

00:00:50.710 --> 00:00:53.430 
thoughts are that I think that people
should<00:00:50.739> be<00:00:51.160> able<00:00:51.340> to<00:00:51.970> enter<00:00:52.480> into<00:00:52.660> legal

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:53.440 
should be able to enter into legal

00:00:53.440 --> 00:00:56.700 
should be able to enter into legal
agreements<00:00:54.040> and<00:00:54.220> I<00:00:54.879> think<00:00:55.300> that<00:00:56.199> that<00:00:56.470> is

00:00:56.700 --> 00:00:56.710 
agreements and I think that that is

00:00:56.710 --> 00:00:58.369 
agreements and I think that that is
something<00:00:57.070> that<00:00:57.280> we<00:00:57.640> should<00:00:57.850> encourage

00:00:58.369 --> 00:00:58.379 
something that we should encourage

00:00:58.379 --> 00:01:00.600 
something that we should encourage
particularly<00:00:59.379> in<00:00:59.500> the<00:00:59.650> case<00:00:59.860> of<00:00:59.920> insurance

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:00.610 
particularly in the case of insurance

00:01:00.610 --> 00:01:03.840 
particularly in the case of insurance
and<00:01:00.790> other<00:01:01.000> areas<00:01:02.340> decisions<00:01:03.340> that<00:01:03.640> have<00:01:03.820> to

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:03.850 
and other areas decisions that have to

00:01:03.850 --> 00:01:07.800 
and other areas decisions that have to
be<00:01:04.000> made<00:01:04.330> I<00:01:05.199> just<00:01:05.890> believe<00:01:06.220> in<00:01:06.580> the<00:01:06.880> unique

00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:07.810 
be made I just believe in the unique

00:01:07.810 --> 00:01:10.440 
be made I just believe in the unique
status<00:01:08.080> of<00:01:08.470> marriage<00:01:08.830> between<00:01:09.180> man<00:01:10.180> and<00:01:10.210> woman

00:01:10.440 --> 00:01:10.450 
status of marriage between man and woman

00:01:10.450 --> 00:01:13.740 
status of marriage between man and woman
and<00:01:10.840> I<00:01:11.229> know<00:01:11.320> that<00:01:11.770> we<00:01:12.070> have<00:01:12.640> a<00:01:12.750> respectful

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:13.750 
and I know that we have a respectful

00:01:13.750 --> 00:01:16.890 
and I know that we have a respectful
disagreement<00:01:14.049> on<00:01:14.500> that<00:01:14.560> issue<00:01:14.860> mmhmm<00:01:15.580> yeah<00:01:15.900> I

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:16.900 
disagreement on that issue mmhmm yeah I

00:01:16.900 --> 00:01:19.440 
disagreement on that issue mmhmm yeah I
mean<00:01:17.080> I<00:01:17.140> think<00:01:17.409> that<00:01:17.860> it's<00:01:18.220> it<00:01:18.640> has<00:01:19.060> looked<00:01:19.270> at
