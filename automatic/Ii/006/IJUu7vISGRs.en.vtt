00:04:35.990 --> 00:04:36.000 
episode in terms to the plot we find out

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:38.030 
episode in terms to the plot we find out
that<00:04:36.240> the<00:04:36.389> princess<00:04:36.870> from<00:04:37.230> the<00:04:37.380> last<00:04:37.590> episode

00:04:41.820 --> 00:04:44.150 
technically alive and she had like I
guess<00:04:42.030> a<00:04:42.060> person<00:04:42.600> in<00:04:42.780> her<00:04:42.990> stead<00:04:43.380> to<00:04:43.680> take<00:04:44.040> her

00:04:44.150 --> 00:04:44.160 
guess a person in her stead to take her

00:04:44.160 --> 00:04:45.740 
guess a person in her stead to take her
spot<00:04:44.250> like<00:04:44.520> a<00:04:44.550> duplicate<00:04:45.030> copy<00:04:45.210> or<00:04:45.419> dumpling

00:04:45.740 --> 00:04:45.750 
spot like a duplicate copy or dumpling

00:04:45.750 --> 00:04:47.900 
spot like a duplicate copy or dumpling
anger<00:04:46.050> and<00:04:46.230> you<00:04:46.590> had<00:04:46.800> her<00:04:47.040> just<00:04:47.430> I'm<00:04:47.550> guessing

00:04:47.900 --> 00:04:47.910 
anger and you had her just I'm guessing

00:04:47.910 --> 00:04:49.610 
anger and you had her just I'm guessing
rest<00:04:48.180> somewhere<00:04:48.419> we<00:04:48.600> find<00:04:48.870> out<00:04:49.050> that<00:04:49.169> she<00:04:49.230> fell

00:04:49.610 --> 00:04:49.620 
rest somewhere we find out that she fell

00:04:49.620 --> 00:04:51.620 
rest somewhere we find out that she fell
ill<00:04:49.830> to<00:04:49.980> the<00:04:50.040> gravity<00:04:50.460> sickness<00:04:50.850> of<00:04:51.000> Earth<00:04:51.389> and

00:04:51.620 --> 00:04:51.630 
ill to the gravity sickness of Earth and

00:04:51.630 --> 00:04:53.960 
ill to the gravity sickness of Earth and
which<00:04:52.050> makes<00:04:52.350> logical<00:04:52.740> sense<00:04:53.100> since<00:04:53.760> you<00:04:53.880> know

00:04:53.960 --> 00:04:53.970 
which makes logical sense since you know

00:04:53.970 --> 00:04:55.310 
which makes logical sense since you know
technically<00:04:54.300> gravity<00:04:54.750> of<00:04:54.840> Mars<00:04:54.990> and<00:04:55.200> Earth

00:04:55.310 --> 00:04:55.320 
technically gravity of Mars and Earth

00:04:55.320 --> 00:04:56.870 
technically gravity of Mars and Earth
are<00:04:55.560> different<00:04:56.310> so<00:04:56.400> I<00:04:56.460> could<00:04:56.610> see<00:04:56.730> why<00:04:56.850> she

00:04:56.870 --> 00:04:56.880 
are different so I could see why she

00:04:56.880 --> 00:04:58.460 
are different so I could see why she
would<00:04:57.090> get<00:04:57.180> sick<00:04:57.360> especially<00:04:57.510> a<00:04:57.870> princess<00:04:58.290> it

00:04:58.460 --> 00:04:58.470 
would get sick especially a princess it

00:04:58.470 --> 00:05:00.590 
would get sick especially a princess it
used<00:04:58.950> to<00:04:59.100> go<00:04:59.610> into<00:04:59.850> different<00:04:59.970> planets<00:05:00.480> all

00:05:00.590 --> 00:05:00.600 
used to go into different planets all

00:05:00.600 --> 00:05:02.000 
used to go into different planets all
the<00:05:00.750> time<00:05:00.900> so<00:05:01.080> I<00:05:01.110> like<00:05:01.470> that<00:05:01.500> I<00:05:01.800> like<00:05:01.980> that

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:02.010 
the time so I like that I like that

00:05:02.010 --> 00:05:03.770 
the time so I like that I like that
element<00:05:02.340> a<00:05:02.460> lot<00:05:02.610> and<00:05:02.970> find<00:05:03.180> out<00:05:03.300> the<00:05:03.419> princess

00:05:03.770 --> 00:05:03.780 
element a lot and find out the princess

00:05:03.780 --> 00:05:05.630 
element a lot and find out the princess
is<00:05:03.990> alive<00:05:04.260> and<00:05:04.530> the<00:05:04.830> only<00:05:05.010> current<00:05:05.460> weight

00:05:05.630 --> 00:05:05.640 
is alive and the only current weight

00:05:05.640 --> 00:05:07.610 
is alive and the only current weight
probably<00:05:06.000> you<00:05:06.210> stop<00:05:06.540> this<00:05:06.750> fucking<00:05:06.960> war<00:05:07.410> at

00:05:07.610 --> 00:05:07.620 
probably you stop this fucking war at

00:05:07.620 --> 00:05:10.130 
probably you stop this fucking war at
the<00:05:07.860> moment<00:05:08.310> is<00:05:08.400> if<00:05:08.760> that<00:05:08.970> princess<00:05:09.570> comes<00:05:09.900> out

00:05:10.130 --> 00:05:10.140 
the moment is if that princess comes out

00:05:10.140 --> 00:05:12.770 
the moment is if that princess comes out
and<00:05:10.380> tries<00:05:10.770> to<00:05:11.100> stop<00:05:11.340> it<00:05:11.370> but<00:05:12.090> we<00:05:12.120> all<00:05:12.450> know

00:05:12.770 --> 00:05:12.780 
and tries to stop it but we all know

00:05:12.780 --> 00:05:14.630 
and tries to stop it but we all know
probably<00:05:13.200> by<00:05:13.470> now<00:05:13.740> that<00:05:13.800> entire<00:05:14.220> step<00:05:14.490> of

00:05:14.630 --> 00:05:14.640 
probably by now that entire step of

00:05:14.640 --> 00:05:16.370 
probably by now that entire step of
trying<00:05:14.790> to<00:05:14.880> assassinate<00:05:15.180> the<00:05:15.510> princess<00:05:16.080> was

00:05:16.370 --> 00:05:16.380 
trying to assassinate the princess was

00:05:16.380 --> 00:05:18.409 
trying to assassinate the princess was
there<00:05:16.650> to<00:05:17.160> start<00:05:17.430> this<00:05:17.580> war<00:05:17.760> to<00:05:17.880> begin<00:05:18.030> with<00:05:18.300> it

00:05:18.409 --> 00:05:18.419 
there to start this war to begin with it

00:05:18.419 --> 00:05:19.850 
there to start this war to begin with it
wasn't<00:05:18.810> actually<00:05:18.960> erv<00:05:19.290> I<00:05:19.500> think<00:05:19.740> that

00:05:19.850 --> 00:05:19.860 
wasn't actually erv I think that

00:05:19.860 --> 00:05:22.219 
wasn't actually erv I think that
attacked<00:05:20.280> the<00:05:20.760> princess<00:05:21.270> it<00:05:21.750> was<00:05:21.870> actually

00:05:22.219 --> 00:05:22.229 
attacked the princess it was actually

00:05:22.229 --> 00:05:23.719 
attacked the princess it was actually
the<00:05:22.350> Mars<00:05:22.650> people<00:05:23.130> the<00:05:23.220> Martians<00:05:23.639> that

00:05:23.719 --> 00:05:23.729 
the Mars people the Martians that

00:05:23.729 --> 00:05:25.280 
the Mars people the Martians that
attacked<00:05:24.090> we<00:05:24.450> can<00:05:24.600> clearly<00:05:24.780> see<00:05:25.020> it<00:05:25.080> because

00:05:25.280 --> 00:05:25.290 
attacked we can clearly see it because

00:05:25.290 --> 00:05:26.750 
attacked we can clearly see it because
we<00:05:25.320> get<00:05:25.500> to<00:05:25.650> see<00:05:25.860> the<00:05:26.250> certain<00:05:26.520> people

00:05:26.750 --> 00:05:26.760

we get to see the certain people
standing<00:05:27.060> on<00:05:27.180> that<00:05:27.270> bridge<00:05:27.330> and<00:05:27.990> then<00:05:28.410> they
