00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:25.250 
not really sure but from other thing
that<00:00:23.760> looks<00:00:24.000> like<00:00:24.060> a<00:00:24.180> way<00:00:24.449> long<00:00:24.660> flash<00:00:24.960> out

00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:25.260 
that looks like a way long flash out

alright so first friends Wow ok this is

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:42.049 
alright so first friends Wow ok this is
really<00:00:35.910> fast<00:00:39.829> that's<00:00:40.829> pretty<00:00:41.190> nice<00:00:41.370> n<00:00:41.579> /<00:00:41.879> when

00:00:42.049 --> 00:00:42.059 
really fast that's pretty nice n / when

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:45.889 
really fast that's pretty nice n / when
I<00:00:42.180> just<00:00:42.390> skipped<00:00:42.660> one<00:00:42.870> like<00:00:43.079> that<00:00:44.690> let's<00:00:45.690> see<00:00:45.870> I

00:00:45.889 --> 00:00:45.899 
I just skipped one like that let's see I

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:48.470 
I just skipped one like that let's see I
think<00:00:45.960> it's<00:00:46.200> a<00:00:46.260> little<00:00:46.379> bits<00:00:46.800> oh<00:00:47.160> and<00:00:48.059> its

00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:48.480 
think it's a little bits oh and its

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:51.160 
think it's a little bits oh and its
really<00:00:48.660> tight<00:00:48.899> right<00:00:49.079> now<00:00:49.140> actually<00:00:50.059> but

00:00:51.160 --> 00:00:51.170 
really tight right now actually but

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:54.650 
really tight right now actually but
you're<00:00:52.170> turning<00:00:52.530> is<00:00:52.680> very<00:00:52.949> all<00:00:53.879> white<00:00:54.390> it's

00:00:54.650 --> 00:00:54.660 
you're turning is very all white it's

00:00:54.660 --> 00:01:00.500 
you're turning is very all white it's
it's<00:00:58.280> like<00:00:59.280> a<00:00:59.370> really<00:00:59.579> swishy<00:00:59.910> smooth<00:01:00.210> almost

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:00.510 
it's like a really swishy smooth almost

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:02.540 
it's like a really swishy smooth almost
like<00:01:00.750> a<00:01:00.780> I<00:01:01.260> don't<00:01:01.980> want<00:01:02.100> to<00:01:02.160> say<00:01:02.280> it's<00:01:02.430> like<00:01:02.520> a

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:02.550 
like a I don't want to say it's like a

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:04.189 
like a I don't want to say it's like a
scratchy<00:01:02.969> smooth<00:01:03.390> like<00:01:03.510> a<00:01:03.539> fang<00:01:03.780> Shih<00:01:04.019> but

00:01:04.189 --> 00:01:04.199 
scratchy smooth like a fang Shih but

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:20.330 
scratchy smooth like a fang Shih but
it's<00:01:04.320> definitely<00:01:14.720> 10<00:01:18.680> exactly<00:01:19.680> ok<00:01:20.040> so<00:01:20.100> it's

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:20.340 
it's definitely 10 exactly ok so it's

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:27.050 
it's definitely 10 exactly ok so it's
smooth<00:01:20.939> in<00:01:21.060> the<00:01:21.150> factory<00:01:21.600> and<00:01:26.060> definitely

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:27.060 
smooth in the factory and definitely

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:30.130 
smooth in the factory and definitely
lighter<00:01:27.360> turning<00:01:27.750> that<00:01:27.840> Frankie<00:01:28.259> so<00:01:28.470> it's

00:01:30.130 --> 00:01:30.140 
lighter turning that Frankie so it's

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:33.440 
lighter turning that Frankie so it's
really<00:01:31.140> really<00:01:31.380> fast<00:01:31.770> it's<00:01:32.220> some<00:01:33.119> kind<00:01:33.390> of

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:33.450 
really really fast it's some kind of

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:37.609 
really really fast it's some kind of
springy<00:01:33.840> actually<00:01:34.350> I<00:01:36.140> yeah<00:01:37.140> I<00:01:37.229> don't<00:01:37.259> really

00:01:37.609 --> 00:01:37.619 
springy actually I yeah I don't really

00:01:37.619 --> 00:01:39.469 
springy actually I yeah I don't really
have<00:01:37.799> to<00:01:37.979> describe<00:01:38.250> this<00:01:38.460> but<00:01:38.729> the<00:01:39.000> sound<00:01:39.270> is

00:01:39.469 --> 00:01:39.479 
have to describe this but the sound is

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:44.330 
have to describe this but the sound is
quite<00:01:40.290> a<00:01:40.320> bit<00:01:40.500> like<00:01:40.680> i'm<00:01:40.799> using<00:01:43.040> i'd<00:01:44.040> say<00:01:44.280> at

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:44.340 
quite a bit like i'm using i'd say at

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:45.590 
quite a bit like i'm using i'd say at
the<00:01:44.460> moment<00:01:44.579> it<00:01:44.850> feels<00:01:45.000> kind<00:01:45.360> of<00:01:45.390> like<00:01:45.479> a

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:45.600 
the moment it feels kind of like a

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:49.639 
the moment it feels kind of like a
slightly<00:01:45.960> swishy<00:01:46.500> er<00:01:46.710> smoother<00:01:47.340> faster<00:01:48.649> less

00:01:49.639 --> 00:01:49.649 
slightly swishy er smoother faster less

00:01:49.649 --> 00:02:01.410 
slightly swishy er smoother faster less
blocking<00:01:50.149> you

00:02:01.410 --> 00:02:01.420 

00:02:01.420 --> 00:02:05.860 

um<00:02:02.420> all<00:02:03.290> right<00:02:03.350> so<00:02:03.680> that's<00:02:04.450> pretty<00:02:05.450> much<00:02:05.630> all<00:02:05.810> i

00:02:05.860 --> 00:02:05.870 
um all right so that's pretty much all i

00:02:05.870 --> 00:02:10.140 
um all right so that's pretty much all i
have<00:02:06.140> to<00:02:06.170> say<00:02:06.290> about<00:02:06.530> it<00:02:06.680> for<00:02:06.920> now<00:02:06.950> all<00:02:08.350> the

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:10.150 
have to say about it for now all the

00:02:10.150 --> 00:02:12.490 
have to say about it for now all the
basically<00:02:11.150> the<00:02:11.270> feeling<00:02:11.960> is<00:02:12.080> really<00:02:12.320> great

00:02:12.490 --> 00:02:12.500 
basically the feeling is really great

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:17.140 
basically the feeling is really great
and<00:02:13.540> the<00:02:14.540> turn<00:02:14.990> of<00:02:15.020> speed<00:02:15.230> is<00:02:15.760> excellent<00:02:16.760> so<00:02:17.000> if

00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:17.150 
and the turn of speed is excellent so if

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:18.610 
and the turn of speed is excellent so if
i<00:02:17.240> can<00:02:17.390> get<00:02:17.510> the<00:02:17.630> corner<00:02:17.900> cutting<00:02:18.080> to<00:02:18.290> be<00:02:18.380> a<00:02:18.410> bit

00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:18.620 
i can get the corner cutting to be a bit

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:23.590 
i can get the corner cutting to be a bit
better<00:02:21.220> then<00:02:22.220> this<00:02:22.610> has<00:02:22.940> serious<00:02:23.330> potential

00:02:23.590 --> 00:02:23.600 
better then this has serious potential

00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:27.400 
better then this has serious potential
to<00:02:23.810> be<00:02:23.900> my<00:02:24.020> main<00:02:25.150> so<00:02:26.150> that's<00:02:26.570> all<00:02:27.050> that<00:02:27.110> I've

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:27.410 
to be my main so that's all that I've

00:02:27.410 --> 00:02:28.570 
to be my main so that's all that I've
got<00:02:27.590> for<00:02:27.740> this<00:02:27.830> video<00:02:28.100> I'll<00:02:28.280> see<00:02:28.430> you<00:02:28.520> a

00:02:28.570 --> 00:02:28.580 
got for this video I'll see you a

00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:31.510 
got for this video I'll see you a
maximum<00:02:29.060> and<00:02:29.300> by
