00:00:36.720 --> 00:00:36.730 
has got some wool surrounding it so that

00:00:36.730 --> 00:00:39.479 
has got some wool surrounding it so that
I<00:00:36.760> don't<00:00:36.910> catch<00:00:37.300> a<00:00:37.449> lot<00:00:37.660> of<00:00:37.690> the<00:00:38.109> room<00:00:39.100> ambience

00:00:39.479 --> 00:00:39.489 
I don't catch a lot of the room ambience

00:00:39.489 --> 00:00:43.560 
I don't catch a lot of the room ambience
and<00:00:40.149> room<00:00:40.780> itself<00:00:41.170> in<00:00:41.890> the<00:00:42.280> recording<00:00:42.760> I<00:00:42.940> want

00:00:43.560 --> 00:00:43.570 
and room itself in the recording I want

00:00:43.570 --> 00:00:45.990 
and room itself in the recording I want
it<00:00:43.629> to<00:00:43.690> be<00:00:43.809> fairly<00:00:44.710> tight<00:00:45.100> but<00:00:45.399> not<00:00:45.609> overly

00:00:45.990 --> 00:00:46.000 
it to be fairly tight but not overly

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:48.419 
it to be fairly tight but not overly
tight<00:00:46.359> so<00:00:46.719> that's<00:00:47.320> why<00:00:47.500> the<00:00:47.559> walls<00:00:47.859> are<00:00:48.070> spaced

00:00:48.419 --> 00:00:48.429 
tight so that's why the walls are spaced

00:00:48.429 --> 00:00:54.180 
tight so that's why the walls are spaced
so<00:00:48.789> far<00:00:49.090> away<00:00:49.210> and<00:00:52.050> other<00:00:53.050> than<00:00:53.260> that<00:00:53.350> let's<00:00:53.739> go

00:01:43.719 --> 00:01:47.100 
just to get the initial muck out of it
I've<00:01:44.560> got<00:01:44.740> also<00:01:45.009> a<00:01:45.159> nice<00:01:45.430> bump<00:01:45.759> at<00:01:46.060> about<00:01:46.539> 3k

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:47.110 
I've got also a nice bump at about 3k

00:01:47.110 --> 00:01:48.810 
I've got also a nice bump at about 3k
which<00:01:47.350> always<00:01:47.590> sounds<00:01:47.979> good<00:01:48.280> on<00:01:48.430> guitars

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:48.820 
which always sounds good on guitars

00:01:48.820 --> 00:01:51.420 
which always sounds good on guitars
especially<00:01:49.509> distorted<00:01:49.990> guitars<00:01:50.350> and<00:01:50.680> I'm

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:51.430 
especially distorted guitars and I'm

00:01:51.430 --> 00:01:53.429 
especially distorted guitars and I'm
also<00:01:51.610> running<00:01:51.969> through<00:01:52.210> a<00:01:52.240> de-stressor<00:01:52.899> with

00:01:53.429 --> 00:01:53.439 
also running through a de-stressor with

00:01:53.439 --> 00:01:55.350 
also running through a de-stressor with
a<00:01:53.469> four<00:01:53.770> to<00:01:53.890> one<00:01:54.009> ratio<00:01:54.070> of<00:01:54.670> compression<00:01:54.850> I'm

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:55.360 
a four to one ratio of compression I'm

00:01:55.360 --> 00:01:57.600 
a four to one ratio of compression I'm
only<00:01:55.539> looking<00:01:55.750> for<00:01:56.110> about<00:01:56.170> one<00:01:56.979> to<00:01:57.009> two<00:01:57.219> beat

00:01:57.600 --> 00:01:57.610 
only looking for about one to two beat

only looking for about one to two beat
DB<00:01:58.060> of<00:01:58.090> compression<00:01:58.329> right<00:01:58.869> off<00:01:59.049> the<00:01:59.170> top<00:01:59.380> and

DB of compression right off the top and

00:01:59.799 --> 00:02:01.499 
DB of compression right off the top and
you<00:02:00.219> know<00:02:00.310> if<00:02:00.399> I<00:02:00.490> need<00:02:00.670> more<00:02:00.850> later<00:02:01.090> I<00:02:01.180> can<00:02:01.299> get

00:02:01.499 --> 00:02:01.509 
you know if I need more later I can get

00:02:01.509 --> 00:02:03.060 
you know if I need more later I can get
it<00:02:01.600> but<00:02:01.689> I<00:02:01.750> don't<00:02:01.810> want<00:02:02.079> to<00:02:02.140> over<00:02:02.469> compress<00:02:02.859> as

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:03.070 
it but I don't want to over compress as

00:02:03.070 --> 00:02:06.389 
it but I don't want to over compress as
I'm<00:02:03.340> recording<00:02:04.799> we're<00:02:05.799> going<00:02:05.920> to<00:02:05.979> do<00:02:06.130> some

00:02:06.389 --> 00:02:06.399 
I'm recording we're going to do some

00:02:06.399 --> 00:02:08.279 
I'm recording we're going to do some
layers<00:02:06.850> later<00:02:07.210> on<00:02:07.450> with<00:02:07.659> a<00:02:07.689> different<00:02:07.930> aunt

00:02:08.279 --> 00:02:08.289 
layers later on with a different aunt

00:02:08.289 --> 00:02:10.640 
layers later on with a different aunt
probably<00:02:08.619> the<00:02:09.250> orange

00:02:10.640 --> 00:02:10.650 
probably the orange

00:02:10.650 --> 00:02:12.960 
probably the orange
most<00:02:11.650> likely<00:02:11.920> the<00:02:12.160> orange<00:02:12.460> it<00:02:12.550> could<00:02:12.730> end<00:02:12.850> up

00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:12.970 
most likely the orange it could end up

00:02:12.970 --> 00:02:14.760 
most likely the orange it could end up
being<00:02:13.150> a<00:02:13.270> Mesa<00:02:13.510> but<00:02:13.870> I<00:02:14.050> don't<00:02:14.230> want<00:02:14.410> the<00:02:14.530> fuzz

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:14.770 
being a Mesa but I don't want the fuzz

00:02:14.770 --> 00:02:16.980 
being a Mesa but I don't want the fuzz
that<00:02:14.800> a<00:02:15.010> Mesa<00:02:15.250> brings<00:02:15.610> so<00:02:16.150> it's<00:02:16.300> probably<00:02:16.720> just

00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:16.990 
that a Mesa brings so it's probably just

00:02:16.990 --> 00:02:19.050 
that a Mesa brings so it's probably just
going<00:02:17.080> to<00:02:17.140> be<00:02:17.200> the<00:02:17.410> orange<00:02:17.770> and<00:02:18.430> as<00:02:18.610> far<00:02:18.790> as<00:02:18.850> my

00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:19.060 
going to be the orange and as far as my

00:02:19.060 --> 00:02:24.810 
going to be the orange and as far as my
guitar<00:02:20.040> I'm<00:02:21.040> using<00:02:21.340> a<00:02:22.380> custom<00:02:23.380> Jackson<00:02:23.920> it's

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:24.820 
guitar I'm using a custom Jackson it's

00:02:24.820 --> 00:02:27.450 
guitar I'm using a custom Jackson it's
you<00:02:25.120> know<00:02:25.240> an<00:02:25.360> older<00:02:25.690> one<00:02:26.010> from<00:02:27.010> the<00:02:27.130> bunker

00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:27.460 
you know an older one from the bunker

00:02:27.460 --> 00:02:31.590 
you know an older one from the bunker
shot<00:02:28.380> it's<00:02:29.380> got<00:02:29.560> a<00:02:29.670> nasty<00:02:30.670> jack<00:02:31.120> on<00:02:31.330> it<00:02:31.450> that's

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:31.600 
shot it's got a nasty jack on it that's

00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:33.660 
shot it's got a nasty jack on it that's
where<00:02:31.750> all<00:02:31.840> that<00:02:31.870> sounds<00:02:32.320> coming<00:02:32.500> from<00:02:32.670> but

00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:33.670 
where all that sounds coming from but

00:02:33.670 --> 00:02:36.720 
where all that sounds coming from but
it's<00:02:34.150> pretty<00:02:34.390> nice<00:02:35.050> guitar<00:02:35.370> it's<00:02:36.370> just<00:02:36.640> I

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:36.730 
it's pretty nice guitar it's just I

00:02:36.730 --> 00:02:38.880 
it's pretty nice guitar it's just I
guess<00:02:36.910> what<00:02:37.090> they<00:02:37.210> call<00:02:37.390> the<00:02:37.540> D<00:02:37.690> key<00:02:37.870> body<00:02:38.080> so

00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:38.890 
guess what they call the D key body so

00:02:38.890 --> 00:02:40.620 
guess what they call the D key body so
you<00:02:39.010> might<00:02:39.160> say<00:02:39.310> made<00:02:39.610> and<00:02:39.970> that's<00:02:40.390> what<00:02:40.540> I'm

00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:40.630 
you might say made and that's what I'm

00:02:40.630 --> 00:02:46.110 
you might say made and that's what I'm
using<00:02:40.780> to<00:02:41.110> track<00:02:41.500> the<00:02:41.710> guitars<00:02:42.070> with<00:02:45.120> all

00:02:46.110 --> 00:02:46.120
