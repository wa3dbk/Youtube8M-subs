but it's is soft like souffle like a
lotion<00:01:31.579> better<00:01:32.579> than<00:01:32.790> emotion<00:01:33.390> but<00:01:33.689> it's<00:01:34.079> like

00:01:34.249 --> 00:01:34.259 
lotion better than emotion but it's like

00:01:34.259 --> 00:01:38.469

a<00:01:34.290> lotion<00:01:34.710> it'll<00:01:35.640> make<00:01:35.820> it<00:01:36.060> here<00:01:36.479> flexible<00:01:37.290> but

00:01:38.469 --> 00:01:38.479 
a lotion it'll make it here flexible but

00:01:38.479 --> 00:01:41.179 
a lotion it'll make it here flexible but
controlled<00:01:39.479> it's<00:01:39.900> not<00:01:40.079> hard<00:01:40.560> it<00:01:40.740> doesn't<00:01:41.040> gets

00:01:41.179 --> 00:01:41.189

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:45.980 
there and i think that's what's kind of
good<00:01:43.619> i<00:01:43.799> like<00:01:44.070> the<00:01:44.280> brains<00:01:44.579> because<00:01:45.450> it's<00:01:45.630> like

00:01:45.980 --> 00:01:45.990 
good i like the brains because it's like

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:48.109 
good i like the brains because it's like
kind<00:01:46.320> of<00:01:46.439> wrinkly<00:01:46.770> it's<00:01:47.729> kind<00:01:47.850> of<00:01:47.939> really

00:01:48.109 --> 00:01:48.119 
kind of wrinkly it's kind of really

00:01:48.119 --> 00:01:50.600 
kind of wrinkly it's kind of really
wrinkly<00:01:48.570> if<00:01:48.899> you<00:01:49.350> do<00:01:49.530> the<00:01:49.680> twist<00:01:49.950> if<00:01:50.280> you<00:01:50.369> do<00:01:50.490> it

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:50.610 
wrinkly if you do the twist if you do it

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:52.969 
wrinkly if you do the twist if you do it
with<00:01:50.759> two<00:01:50.970> strands<00:01:51.299> and<00:01:51.600> twist<00:01:51.840> it<00:01:51.990> back<00:01:52.259> it'll

00:01:52.969 --> 00:01:52.979 
with two strands and twist it back it'll

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:55.460 
with two strands and twist it back it'll
be<00:01:53.100> more<00:01:53.399> of<00:01:53.430> a<00:01:53.610> curl<00:01:53.909> so<00:01:54.750> the<00:01:54.810> clothes<00:01:55.110> kind<00:01:55.380> of
