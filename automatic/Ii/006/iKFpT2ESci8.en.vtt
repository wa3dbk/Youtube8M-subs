a CB and b8 and the CB and XS 20 symbol

00:00:08.189 --> 00:00:10.610 
a CB and b8 and the CB and XS 20 symbol
now<00:00:09.030> first<00:00:09.450> of<00:00:09.599> all<00:00:09.660> I<00:00:09.780> know<00:00:09.870> these<00:00:10.170> two<00:00:10.410> are

now first of all I know these two are

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:13.039 
now first of all I know these two are
different<00:00:10.740> sizes<00:00:11.400> like<00:00:11.509> one's<00:00:12.509> a<00:00:12.630> 10<00:00:12.840> inch

00:00:13.039 --> 00:00:13.049 
different sizes like one's a 10 inch

00:00:13.049 --> 00:00:16.160 
different sizes like one's a 10 inch
one's<00:00:13.320> a<00:00:13.530> 16<00:00:13.950> inch<00:00:14.130> but<00:00:15.030> this<00:00:15.299> video<00:00:15.599> is<00:00:15.929> it<00:00:16.049> to

00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:16.170 
one's a 16 inch but this video is it to

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:19.429 
one's a 16 inch but this video is it to
compare<00:00:16.500> sound<00:00:16.830> to<00:00:17.310> compare<00:00:17.810> the<00:00:18.810> features<00:00:18.990> of

00:00:19.429 --> 00:00:19.439 
compare sound to compare the features of

00:00:19.439 --> 00:00:22.810 
compare sound to compare the features of
it<00:00:19.699> such<00:00:20.699> as<00:00:20.730> their<00:00:21.060> looks<00:00:21.330> appearance<00:00:21.990> and

00:00:22.810 --> 00:00:22.820 
it such as their looks appearance and

00:00:22.820 --> 00:00:25.880 
it such as their looks appearance and
the<00:00:23.820> type<00:00:24.029> of<00:00:24.060> metal<00:00:24.330> and<00:00:24.630> all<00:00:24.720> that<00:00:24.930> so<00:00:25.680> let's

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:25.890 
the type of metal and all that so let's

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:30.230 
the type of metal and all that so let's
get<00:00:26.010> started<00:00:28.189> the<00:00:29.189> first<00:00:29.220> major<00:00:29.699> difference

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:30.240

00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:34.620 
of Sabian b8 and XS 20 is the sound now

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:37.490

this one is if you can see that this

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:05.420 
this one is if you can see that this
affects<00:01:03.690> the<00:01:03.870> sound<00:01:04.080> because<00:01:04.650> it<00:01:05.010> gives<00:01:05.250> the
