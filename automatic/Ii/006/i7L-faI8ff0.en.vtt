00:00:00.460 --> 00:00:04.540
 very good to all welcome to a 

00:00:02.590 --> 00:00:07.330
 new visual network this time they have 

00:00:04.540 --> 00:00:10.090
 done to the twister face and let's see what they have 

00:00:07.330 --> 00:00:12.969
 changed to twitter face as we see a 

00:00:10.090 --> 00:00:15.370
 appearance much more normal to 

00:00:12.969 --> 00:00:17.230
 people that is from today not like 

00:00:15.370 --> 00:00:19.329
 he was before he looked like a doll of 2 

00:00:17.230 --> 00:00:20.949
 pixels but good start with the 

00:00:19.329 --> 00:00:23.649
 cries of war to see if they have changed 

00:00:20.949 --> 00:00:26.069
 some of them I have never lost one 

00:00:23.649 --> 00:00:26.069
 departure 

00:00:27.460 --> 00:00:32.079
 cheat is a nice way to say 

00:00:30.279 --> 00:00:36.570
 win 

00:00:32.079 --> 00:00:36.570
 there are only two jesters in the deck 

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:41.650
 just an idiot 

00:00:38.570 --> 00:00:44.640
 with the hand you give him 

00:00:41.650 --> 00:00:44.640
 the dancing 

00:00:51.740 --> 00:00:56.989
 have up 

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:56.989
 even your merit to the dance 

00:01:03.760 --> 00:01:08.380
 already 

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:08.380
 and laughter 

00:01:10.720 --> 00:01:17.090
 let's move on to the spells 

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:17.090
 so placed well in the camera today 

00:01:18.340 --> 00:01:22.770
 nor with my feet are we going to throw a co 

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:27.470
 get away a little we had to throw another 

00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:38.020
 you see we are going to wait for another one because how 

00:01:35.140 --> 00:01:41.030
 change the color charts let's calculate 

00:01:38.020 --> 00:01:45.290
 I have seen everything 

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:47.690
 we are going to double as you see these are the 

00:01:45.290 --> 00:01:49.500
 letters of now let's catch percent 

00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:51.260
 the rod 

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:52.970
 we distribute 

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:55.510
 and the effect of the great wound the truth 

00:01:52.970 --> 00:01:59.790
 quite handsome 

00:01:55.510 --> 00:01:59.790
 let's catch another blue 

00:02:01.210 --> 00:02:06.079
 is what blue does 

00:02:03.409 --> 00:02:09.700
 this is an effect and let's see if I take 

00:02:06.079 --> 00:02:09.700
 the first the red and america 

00:02:09.860 --> 00:02:15.310
 and I know what red does, this is the 

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:19.319
 passive the passive of the e 

00:02:15.310 --> 00:02:19.319
 how do you see this pile of letters 

00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:25.710
 as for the circulation 

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:27.690
 the view 

00:02:25.710 --> 00:02:30.560
 if you do not give me these pulls maybe it would be 

00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:30.560
 a little more pleasant 

00:02:31.510 --> 00:02:36.670
 let's do it again the passive here 

00:02:33.610 --> 00:02:38.760
 is the passive at this rate then the 

00:02:36.670 --> 00:02:40.349
 we throw again 

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:42.980
 let's quickly throw a few 

00:02:40.349 --> 00:02:42.980
 more things 

00:02:43.610 --> 00:02:47.770
 to catch again the passive 

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:52.890
 of luck 

00:02:47.770 --> 00:02:52.890
 and there it is and finally the r 

00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:59.530
 this is the effect of yesterday and now we are going 

00:02:56.209 --> 00:02:59.530
 to interpret the abysses 

00:03:05.270 --> 00:03:10.150
 I hope you liked this revolving 

00:03:07.310 --> 00:03:10.150
 and go out as much as I 

00:03:13.990 --> 00:03:19.210
 because the truth is deserved by many of 

00:03:16.990 --> 00:03:21.070
 the old characters and this was one of 

00:03:19.210 --> 00:03:23.020
 they at least liked me 

00:03:21.070 --> 00:03:25.060
 quite starworks I hope that you 

00:03:23.020 --> 00:03:28.710
 also and see you in the next 

00:03:25.060 --> 00:03:28.710
 goodbye video 

00:03:42.850 --> 00:03:45.850
