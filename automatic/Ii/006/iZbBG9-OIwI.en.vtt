00:00:03.920 --> 00:00:10.550
 Hello everyone, Arte and Kolya, and we 

00:00:07.130 --> 00:00:15.719
 we play more precisely we try the card 

00:00:10.550 --> 00:00:20.279
 rush minion who kolyan also downloaded here 

00:00:15.719 --> 00:00:23.400
 need someone to play the minions by the poet like on 

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:27.330
 tablets who on the phone there type 

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:30.990
 you have to run two handfuls 

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:35.070
 benefits and then made a card 

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:38.120
 it looks like something like and we 

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:43.320
 going to run 

00:00:38.120 --> 00:00:44.820
 Here speed is given endlessly and on 

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:48.739
 score 1 we run 

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:48.739
 1 2 3 

00:00:51.200 --> 00:01:02.990
 and Kondrashka 

00:00:57.290 --> 00:01:07.400
 and in the back how can I tell you what else 

00:01:02.990 --> 00:01:08.770
 then it is necessary to go there and just do not have any 

00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:28.790
 a dash 

00:01:08.770 --> 00:01:31.700
 as such lies the hall here after 

00:01:28.790 --> 00:01:34.190
 this ice will be the most difficult as here 

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:34.850
 what it was right now was the hardest thing 

00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:39.100
 jumps 

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:39.100
 it's very lived there will have to jump 

00:01:39.580 --> 00:01:44.470
 you ca n't go on a campaign without creativity 

00:01:44.740 --> 00:01:55.340
 think somehow when jumping from to 

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:58.220
 strange here now eat her and sometimes if 

00:01:55.340 --> 00:02:00.679
 jump over there that goes it is not yet 

00:01:58.220 --> 00:02:02.300
 approached you drink you jump to 

00:02:00.679 --> 00:02:06.020
 you press the wall and they need to somehow 

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:08.890
 jump up some strange let's 

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:18.190
 we run further we run our beriberi 

00:02:08.890 --> 00:02:21.190
 card reader for the day before 5 hours 

00:02:18.190 --> 00:02:21.190
 bale 

00:02:22.810 --> 00:02:27.340
 Only here in the course of such a system that 

00:02:24.940 --> 00:02:27.819
 Sometimes one of the type returns only 

00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:30.640
 three 

00:02:27.819 --> 00:02:33.120
 also sometimes and so you couch 

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:33.120
 Romanenko 

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:39.519

00:02:36.130 --> 00:02:42.390
 or another pilot you go back 

00:02:39.519 --> 00:02:42.390

00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:49.650
