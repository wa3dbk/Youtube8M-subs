and<00:01:10.170> look<00:01:10.440> at<00:01:10.530> this<00:01:10.650> on<00:01:10.830> purpose

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:11.400 
and look at this on purpose

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:12.859 
and look at this on purpose
now<00:01:11.820> I'll<00:01:11.940> describe<00:01:12.180> what<00:01:12.420> I<00:01:12.450> was<00:01:12.600> doing

00:01:12.859 --> 00:01:12.869 
now I'll describe what I was doing

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:22.070 
now I'll describe what I was doing
before<00:01:12.990> I<00:01:13.229> missed

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:22.080 

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:31.469 

let's<00:01:23.080> at<00:01:23.200> least<00:01:23.259> try<00:01:23.470> to<00:01:23.560> hit<00:01:23.680> the<00:01:23.799> ball<00:01:30.479> now

00:01:31.469 --> 00:01:31.479 
let's at least try to hit the ball now

00:01:31.479 --> 00:01:32.760 
let's at least try to hit the ball now
the<00:01:31.540> difference<00:01:31.960> there<00:01:32.110> is<00:01:32.140> that<00:01:32.259> I<00:01:32.380> didn't

00:01:32.760 --> 00:01:32.770 
the difference there is that I didn't

00:01:32.770 --> 00:01:33.930 
the difference there is that I didn't
follow<00:01:32.950> the<00:01:33.310> line<00:01:33.460> that's<00:01:33.670> sitting<00:01:33.909> right

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:33.940 
follow the line that's sitting right

00:01:33.940 --> 00:01:35.460 
follow the line that's sitting right
here<00:01:34.060> in<00:01:34.180> front<00:01:34.270> of<00:01:34.479> me<00:01:34.540> and<00:01:35.259> I'm<00:01:35.350> gonna

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:35.470 
here in front of me and I'm gonna

00:01:35.470 --> 00:01:38.760 
here in front of me and I'm gonna
explain<00:01:35.649> to<00:01:35.860> you<00:01:35.970> why<00:01:37.110> those<00:01:38.110> first<00:01:38.380> shots

00:01:38.760 --> 00:01:38.770 
explain to you why those first shots

00:01:38.770 --> 00:01:43.770 
explain to you why those first shots
were<00:01:38.830> to<00:01:39.159> my<00:01:39.250> last<00:01:39.399> shot<00:01:39.580> didn't<00:01:39.850> I<00:01:42.720> don't<00:01:43.720> know

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:43.780 
were to my last shot didn't I don't know

00:01:43.780 --> 00:01:45.359 
were to my last shot didn't I don't know
I<00:01:43.810> made<00:01:44.049> three<00:01:44.259> or<00:01:44.289> four<00:01:44.409> before<00:01:44.860> I<00:01:44.890> missed<00:01:45.159> but

00:01:45.359 --> 00:01:45.369 
I made three or four before I missed but

00:01:45.369 --> 00:01:51.060 
I made three or four before I missed but
I<00:01:45.549> know<00:01:45.880> I<00:01:46.000> made<00:01:46.180> three<00:01:46.390> industry<00:01:46.930> I<00:01:49.979> mean<00:01:50.979> at

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:51.070 
I know I made three industry I mean at

00:01:51.070 --> 00:01:53.010 
I know I made three industry I mean at
least<00:01:51.100> three<00:01:51.460> shot<00:01:51.729> using<00:01:52.090> an<00:01:52.180> aiming<00:01:52.509> system

00:01:53.010 --> 00:01:53.020 
least three shot using an aiming system

00:01:53.020 --> 00:01:55.109 
least three shot using an aiming system
now<00:01:53.229> if<00:01:53.380> the<00:01:53.530> aiming<00:01:53.890> seen<00:01:54.310> any<00:01:54.550> system<00:01:54.970> that

00:01:55.109 --> 00:01:55.119 
now if the aiming seen any system that

00:01:55.119 --> 00:01:57.840 
now if the aiming seen any system that
Jill<00:01:55.270> Tucker<00:01:55.450> uses<00:01:56.159> well<00:01:57.159> it's<00:01:57.490> the<00:01:57.640> same

00:01:57.840 --> 00:01:57.850 
Jill Tucker uses well it's the same

00:01:57.850 --> 00:02:00.419 
Jill Tucker uses well it's the same
concept<00:01:58.259> this<00:01:59.259> is<00:01:59.380> actually<00:01:59.679> not<00:01:59.800> an<00:02:00.130> aiming

00:02:00.419 --> 00:02:00.429 
concept this is actually not an aiming

concept this is actually not an aiming
system<00:02:00.460> this<00:02:01.090> is<00:02:01.270> just<00:02:01.300> a<00:02:01.509> geometric<00:02:01.750> concept

00:02:02.550 --> 00:02:02.560 
system this is just a geometric concept

00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:05.760 
system this is just a geometric concept
that<00:02:03.550> allows<00:02:04.090> for<00:02:04.479> the<00:02:05.020> balls<00:02:05.259> to<00:02:05.440> meet<00:02:05.619> the

00:02:05.760 --> 00:02:05.770 
that allows for the balls to meet the

00:02:05.770 --> 00:02:09.840 
that allows for the balls to meet the
exact<00:02:06.100> correct<00:02:06.729> position<00:02:08.369> the<00:02:09.369> concept<00:02:09.759> has

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:09.850 
exact correct position the concept has

00:02:09.850 --> 00:02:12.539 
exact correct position the concept has
been<00:02:09.970> turned<00:02:10.179> into<00:02:10.360> aiming<00:02:10.720> systems<00:02:11.050> I<00:02:11.430> use<00:02:12.430> it

00:02:12.539 --> 00:02:12.549 
been turned into aiming systems I use it

00:02:12.549 --> 00:02:14.789 
been turned into aiming systems I use it
as<00:02:12.640> a<00:02:12.670> training<00:02:12.940> tool<00:02:13.269> to<00:02:13.569> develop<00:02:14.260> better

00:02:14.789 --> 00:02:14.799 
as a training tool to develop better

00:02:14.799 --> 00:02:19.979 
as a training tool to develop better
feel<00:02:15.010> for<00:02:15.100> where<00:02:15.970> to<00:02:16.090> aim<00:02:18.330> there's<00:02:19.330> variations

00:02:19.979 --> 00:02:19.989 
feel for where to aim there's variations

00:02:19.989 --> 00:02:21.930 
feel for where to aim there's variations
of<00:02:20.110> it<00:02:20.290> Joe<00:02:20.530> Tucker<00:02:20.769> uses<00:02:21.160> a<00:02:21.190> variation<00:02:21.670> of<00:02:21.790> it

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:21.940 
of it Joe Tucker uses a variation of it

00:02:21.940 --> 00:02:23.940 
of it Joe Tucker uses a variation of it
by<00:02:22.030> numbering<00:02:22.360> balls<00:02:22.690> and<00:02:22.989> having<00:02:23.530> match<00:02:23.709> up

00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:23.950

by numbering balls and having match up
the<00:02:24.040> numbers<00:02:24.280> basically<00:02:25.090> what<00:02:25.209> it<00:02:25.299> is<00:02:25.420> it's

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:25.630 
the numbers basically what it is it's

00:02:25.630 --> 00:02:27.050 
the numbers basically what it is it's
just<00:02:25.690> a<00:02:25.870> way<00:02:25.959> to<00:02:25.989> find<00:02:26.290> the<00:02:26.350> contact<00:02:26.709> points

00:02:27.050 --> 00:02:27.060 
just a way to find the contact points

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:29.400

00:03:06.630 --> 00:03:06.640 
more tricky find the contact point on

00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:08.220 
more tricky find the contact point on
the<00:03:06.730> cue<00:03:06.880> ball<00:03:06.910> you're<00:03:07.329> dealing<00:03:07.660> two<00:03:07.810> spheres

00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:08.230 
the cue ball you're dealing two spheres

00:03:08.230 --> 00:03:10.080 
the cue ball you're dealing two spheres
it's<00:03:09.070> actually<00:03:09.370> not<00:03:09.519> tricky<00:03:09.910> if<00:03:10.030> you

00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:10.090 
it's actually not tricky if you

00:03:10.090 --> 00:03:11.039 
it's actually not tricky if you
understand<00:03:10.510> the<00:03:10.570> zoomit

00:03:11.039 --> 00:03:11.049

going<00:03:13.420> to<00:03:13.450> explain<00:03:13.660> it<00:03:13.780> to<00:03:13.810> you<00:03:14.019> it's<00:03:14.200> really

00:03:14.340 --> 00:03:14.350 
going to explain it to you it's really

00:03:14.350 --> 00:03:15.870 
going to explain it to you it's really

the ribbon went straight to the two ball

00:03:33.070 --> 00:03:34.340 
the ribbon went straight to the two ball

00:03:34.340 --> 00:03:34.350 
which shows you were look on

00:03:36.530 --> 00:03:36.540 
the two ball right there now if you

front of cue ball but that line

00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:47.120 
front of cue ball but that line
intersects<00:03:43.890> is<00:03:45.230> contact<00:03:46.230> point<00:03:46.410> of<00:03:46.530> cue<00:03:46.710> ball

intersects is contact point of cue ball

00:03:47.130 --> 00:03:49.010 
intersects is contact point of cue ball
then<00:03:48.060> if<00:03:48.180> you<00:03:48.270> join<00:03:48.540> those<00:03:48.660> two<00:03:48.870> points

00:03:49.010 --> 00:03:49.020 
then if you join those two points

00:03:49.020 --> 00:03:51.410 
then if you join those two points
together<00:03:49.290> that's<00:03:50.250> the<00:03:50.400> baculum<00:03:50.820> cue<00:03:51.180> ball<00:03:51.330> to

together that's the baculum cue ball to

00:03:51.420 --> 00:03:54.320 
together that's the baculum cue ball to
follow<00:03:52.250> but<00:03:53.250> you<00:03:53.310> can't<00:03:53.670> strike<00:03:54.000> it<00:03:54.210> from

00:03:54.330 --> 00:03:55.700 
follow but you can't strike it from
there<00:03:54.480> because<00:03:54.690> you're<00:03:54.900> striking<00:03:55.200> off<00:03:55.440> center

00:03:55.700 --> 00:03:55.710 
there because you're striking off center

00:03:55.710 --> 00:03:57.140 
there because you're striking off center
and<00:03:55.740> sport<00:03:56.190> will<00:03:56.310> throw<00:03:56.460> it<00:03:56.550> off<00:03:56.670> won't<00:03:56.970> even

00:03:57.140 --> 00:03:57.150 
and sport will throw it off won't even

and sport will throw it off won't even
hit<00:03:57.240> the<00:03:57.330> ball<00:03:57.480> so<00:03:58.230> what<00:03:58.350> you<00:03:58.470> do<00:03:58.620> is<00:03:58.710> you<00:03:58.770> put<00:03:58.920> a

00:03:58.940 --> 00:03:58.950 
hit the ball so what you do is you put a

00:03:58.950 --> 00:04:01.070 
hit the ball so what you do is you put a
little<00:03:59.010> ship<00:03:59.310> one<00:03:59.460> more<00:03:59.610> time<00:03:59.820> to<00:04:00.660> center<00:04:00.900> cue

it's the perfect in line every time and

it's the perfect in line every time and
just<00:04:08.370> to<00:04:08.490> show<00:04:08.640> you<00:04:08.700> that<00:04:08.760> it<00:04:08.970> wasn't<00:04:09.090> a<00:04:09.450> fluke

00:04:11.840 --> 00:04:11.850 
but I just happen to choose the right

but I just happen to choose the right
angle<00:04:12.150> that<00:04:12.180> works<00:04:12.450> I'll<00:04:12.720> change<00:04:13.050> the<00:04:13.230> angle
