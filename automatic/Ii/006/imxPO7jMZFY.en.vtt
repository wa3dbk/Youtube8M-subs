00:03:40.100 --> 00:03:40.110 
cream I'm actually going to use to

00:03:40.110 --> 00:03:41.990 
cream I'm actually going to use to
freeze<00:03:40.410> and<00:03:40.620> stir<00:03:40.830> method<00:03:41.280> I've<00:03:41.490> just<00:03:41.730> placed

00:03:41.990 --> 00:03:42.000 
freeze and stir method I've just placed

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:43.670 
freeze and stir method I've just placed
the<00:03:42.180> ice<00:03:42.330> cream<00:03:42.660> mixture<00:03:43.020> in<00:03:43.290> a<00:03:43.380> shallow

00:03:43.670 --> 00:03:43.680 
the ice cream mixture in a shallow

00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:45.710 
the ice cream mixture in a shallow
baking<00:03:43.980> dish<00:03:44.400> and<00:03:44.580> popped<00:03:45.090> it<00:03:45.270> in<00:03:45.360> the<00:03:45.420> freezer

00:03:45.710 --> 00:03:45.720 
baking dish and popped it in the freezer

00:03:45.720 --> 00:03:48.230 
baking dish and popped it in the freezer
for<00:03:46.050> 30<00:03:46.620> minutes<00:03:47.100> and<00:03:47.310> now<00:03:47.520> I'm<00:03:47.550> just<00:03:47.970> going<00:03:48.150> to

00:03:48.230 --> 00:03:48.240 
for 30 minutes and now I'm just going to

00:03:48.240 --> 00:03:50.330 
for 30 minutes and now I'm just going to
whisk<00:03:48.690> it<00:03:48.959> up<00:03:49.170> you<00:03:49.320> can<00:03:49.470> see<00:03:49.680> it's<00:03:49.860> starting<00:03:50.160> to

00:03:50.330 --> 00:03:50.340 
whisk it up you can see it's starting to

00:03:50.340 --> 00:03:52.310 
whisk it up you can see it's starting to
get<00:03:50.459> a<00:03:50.520> little<00:03:50.730> bit<00:03:50.940> of<00:03:51.030> frozen<00:03:51.360> bits<00:03:51.900> in<00:03:52.170> it

00:03:52.310 --> 00:03:52.320 
get a little bit of frozen bits in it

00:03:52.320 --> 00:03:54.740 
get a little bit of frozen bits in it
and<00:03:52.590> I'm<00:03:53.010> going<00:03:53.280> to<00:03:53.490> basically<00:03:53.790> repeat<00:03:54.570> this

00:03:54.740 --> 00:03:54.750 
and I'm going to basically repeat this

00:03:54.750 --> 00:03:57.050 
and I'm going to basically repeat this
process<00:03:55.040> pop<00:03:56.040> it<00:03:56.220> in<00:03:56.310> a<00:03:56.430> freezer<00:03:56.640> for<00:03:56.880> 30

00:03:57.050 --> 00:03:57.060 
process pop it in a freezer for 30

00:03:57.060 --> 00:03:59.030 
process pop it in a freezer for 30
minutes<00:03:57.420> whisking<00:03:58.080> putting<00:03:58.560> it<00:03:58.680> back<00:03:58.800> in<00:03:58.950> the

00:03:59.030 --> 00:03:59.040 
minutes whisking putting it back in the

00:03:59.040 --> 00:04:01.010 
minutes whisking putting it back in the
freezer<00:03:59.220> whisking<00:03:59.850> until<00:04:00.000> it<00:04:00.540> starts<00:04:00.870> to<00:04:00.930> form

00:04:01.010 --> 00:04:01.020 
freezer whisking until it starts to form

00:04:01.020 --> 00:04:04.250 
freezer whisking until it starts to form
a<00:04:01.380> thickened<00:04:01.860> ice<00:04:02.070> cream<00:04:02.550> and<00:04:03.080> texture<00:04:04.080> and

00:04:04.250 --> 00:04:04.260 
a thickened ice cream and texture and

00:04:04.260 --> 00:04:06.170 
a thickened ice cream and texture and
you<00:04:04.830> know<00:04:04.980> that<00:04:05.190> it's<00:04:05.340> ready<00:04:05.550> when<00:04:05.700> it<00:04:05.910> starts

00:04:06.170 --> 00:04:06.180 
you know that it's ready when it starts

00:04:06.180 --> 00:04:08.060 
you know that it's ready when it starts
to<00:04:06.360> kind<00:04:06.510> of<00:04:06.630> stick<00:04:06.870> to<00:04:06.990> the<00:04:07.080> pan<00:04:07.320> and<00:04:07.560> hold<00:04:07.920> the

00:04:08.060 --> 00:04:08.070 
to kind of stick to the pan and hold the

00:04:08.070 --> 00:04:10.699 
to kind of stick to the pan and hold the
shape<00:04:08.280> of<00:04:08.490> the<00:04:08.670> pan<00:04:08.940> so<00:04:09.209> it<00:04:09.959> takes<00:04:10.260> about<00:04:10.380> 2<00:04:10.680> to

00:04:10.699 --> 00:04:10.709 
shape of the pan so it takes about 2 to

00:04:10.709 --> 00:04:12.380 
shape of the pan so it takes about 2 to
3<00:04:10.950> hours<00:04:11.250> for<00:04:11.430> this<00:04:11.520> process<00:04:11.940> all<00:04:12.120> together

00:04:12.380 --> 00:04:12.390 
3 hours for this process all together

00:04:12.390 --> 00:04:14.840 
3 hours for this process all together
and<00:04:12.870> once<00:04:13.320> you're<00:04:13.470> done<00:04:13.620> you<00:04:13.920> can<00:04:13.950> pour<00:04:14.730> the

00:04:14.840 --> 00:04:14.850 
and once you're done you can pour the

00:04:14.850 --> 00:04:16.849 
and once you're done you can pour the
ice<00:04:14.940> cream<00:04:15.240> into<00:04:15.690> a<00:04:15.720> container<00:04:16.260> a<00:04:16.380> sealable

00:04:16.849 --> 00:04:16.859 
ice cream into a container a sealable

00:04:16.859 --> 00:04:18.740 
ice cream into a container a sealable
container<00:04:17.489> and<00:04:17.790> you're<00:04:18.150> good<00:04:18.330> to<00:04:18.450> go

00:04:18.740 --> 00:04:18.750 
container and you're good to go

00:04:18.750 --> 00:04:20.060 
container and you're good to go
and<00:04:18.870> of<00:04:18.989> course<00:04:19.260> you<00:04:19.410> have<00:04:19.530> to<00:04:19.650> have<00:04:19.680> a<00:04:19.799> little

00:04:20.060 --> 00:04:20.070 
and of course you have to have a little

00:04:20.070 --> 00:04:21.560 
and of course you have to have a little
taste<00:04:20.280> before<00:04:20.489> you<00:04:20.820> do<00:04:20.970> that<00:04:21.120> just<00:04:21.330> to<00:04:21.540> make

00:04:21.560 --> 00:04:21.570 
taste before you do that just to make

00:04:21.570 --> 00:04:24.290 
taste before you do that just to make
sure<00:04:21.720> it's<00:04:22.049> good<00:04:22.340> the<00:04:23.340> next<00:04:23.610> method<00:04:23.760> is<00:04:24.090> the

00:04:24.290 --> 00:04:24.300 
sure it's good the next method is the

00:04:24.300 --> 00:04:25.100 
sure it's good the next method is the
plastic

00:04:25.100 --> 00:04:25.110 
plastic

00:04:25.110 --> 00:04:26.929 
plastic
method<00:04:25.620> and<00:04:25.830> you<00:04:25.949> may<00:04:26.099> have<00:04:26.310> done<00:04:26.490> this<00:04:26.669> in

00:04:26.929 --> 00:04:26.939 
method and you may have done this in

00:04:26.939 --> 00:04:29.089 
method and you may have done this in
science<00:04:27.419> classes<00:04:27.659> in<00:04:27.870> school<00:04:28.259> or<00:04:28.590> for<00:04:28.860> a

00:04:29.089 --> 00:04:29.099 
science classes in school or for a

00:04:29.099 --> 00:04:31.999 
science classes in school or for a
summer<00:04:29.729> project<00:04:30.419> but<00:04:30.900> basically<00:04:31.110> you<00:04:31.590> place

00:04:31.999 --> 00:04:32.009 
summer project but basically you place

00:04:32.009 --> 00:04:34.790 
summer project but basically you place
your<00:04:32.310> ice<00:04:32.520> cream<00:04:32.849> mixture<00:04:33.240> in<00:04:33.629> a<00:04:34.229> quart<00:04:34.590> size

00:04:34.790 --> 00:04:34.800 
your ice cream mixture in a quart size

00:04:34.800 --> 00:04:37.520 
your ice cream mixture in a quart size
bag<00:04:35.120> you<00:04:36.120> may<00:04:36.300> need<00:04:36.509> to<00:04:36.659> use<00:04:36.689> two<00:04:37.050> quarts<00:04:37.379> ice

00:04:37.520 --> 00:04:37.530 
bag you may need to use two quarts ice

00:04:37.530 --> 00:04:40.159 
bag you may need to use two quarts ice
bags<00:04:37.800> and<00:04:38.189> I<00:04:38.610> had<00:04:39.090> a<00:04:39.120> little<00:04:39.419> bit<00:04:39.569> left<00:04:39.599> over

00:04:40.159 --> 00:04:40.169 
bags and I had a little bit left over

00:04:40.169 --> 00:04:42.529 
bags and I had a little bit left over
but<00:04:40.469> I<00:04:40.740> just<00:04:40.979> use<00:04:41.129> the<00:04:41.310> one<00:04:41.550> and<00:04:41.789> then<00:04:42.240> place<00:04:42.509> it

00:04:42.529 --> 00:04:42.539 
but I just use the one and then place it

00:04:42.539 --> 00:04:44.899 
but I just use the one and then place it
in<00:04:42.900> another<00:04:43.500> quart<00:04:43.949> size<00:04:44.129> bag<00:04:44.430> so<00:04:44.639> you<00:04:44.669> want<00:04:44.849> to

00:04:44.899 --> 00:04:44.909 
in another quart size bag so you want to

00:04:44.909 --> 00:04:47.629 
in another quart size bag so you want to
make<00:04:45.030> sure<00:04:45.060> it's<00:04:45.419> perfectly<00:04:46.319> sealed<00:04:46.800> now

00:04:47.629 --> 00:04:47.639 
make sure it's perfectly sealed now

00:04:47.639 --> 00:04:49.369 
make sure it's perfectly sealed now
we're<00:04:47.789> placing<00:04:47.969> those<00:04:48.330> two<00:04:48.509> bags<00:04:48.750> in<00:04:48.990> a

00:04:49.369 --> 00:04:49.379 
we're placing those two bags in a

00:04:49.379 --> 00:04:52.309 
we're placing those two bags in a
freezer<00:04:49.800> bag<00:04:50.099> and<00:04:50.129> adding<00:04:50.969> in<00:04:51.120> 4<00:04:51.569> tablespoons

00:04:52.309 --> 00:04:52.319 
freezer bag and adding in 4 tablespoons

00:04:52.319 --> 00:04:54.649 
freezer bag and adding in 4 tablespoons
of<00:04:52.469> coarse<00:04:53.069> salt<00:04:53.490> you<00:04:53.729> saw<00:04:53.969> that<00:04:54.150> I<00:04:54.240> used<00:04:54.449> ice

00:04:54.649 --> 00:04:54.659 
of coarse salt you saw that I used ice

00:04:54.659 --> 00:04:57.350 
of coarse salt you saw that I used ice
cream<00:04:54.960> salt<00:04:55.289> but<00:04:55.710> you<00:04:56.009> can<00:04:56.250> also<00:04:56.490> use<00:04:56.849> regular

00:04:57.350 --> 00:04:57.360 
cream salt but you can also use regular

00:04:57.360 --> 00:04:59.600 
cream salt but you can also use regular
salt<00:04:57.599> ice<00:04:58.139> cream<00:04:58.500> salt<00:04:58.740> does<00:04:58.889> work<00:04:59.039> best<00:04:59.279> but

00:04:59.600 --> 00:04:59.610 
salt ice cream salt does work best but

00:04:59.610 --> 00:05:02.540 
salt ice cream salt does work best but
regular<00:05:00.060> salt<00:05:00.300> will<00:05:00.599> get<00:05:00.870> the<00:05:01.020> job<00:05:01.199> done<00:05:01.500> so<00:05:02.430> to

00:05:02.540 --> 00:05:02.550 
regular salt will get the job done so to

00:05:02.550 --> 00:05:05.360 
regular salt will get the job done so to
that<00:05:02.939> salt<00:05:03.240> I<00:05:03.360> added<00:05:03.750> also<00:05:03.960> and<00:05:04.409> about<00:05:04.919> 4<00:05:05.129> cups

00:05:05.360 --> 00:05:05.370 
that salt I added also and about 4 cups

00:05:05.370 --> 00:05:07.399 
that salt I added also and about 4 cups
of<00:05:05.550> ice<00:05:05.729> I<00:05:06.000> actually<00:05:06.210> ended<00:05:06.719> up<00:05:06.870> adding<00:05:07.050> more

00:05:07.399 --> 00:05:07.409 
of ice I actually ended up adding more
