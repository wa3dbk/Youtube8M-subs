fishtail<00:04:02.959> braids<00:04:03.230> on<00:04:03.410> these<00:04:03.620> sides<00:04:04.269> so<00:04:05.269> I'm

00:04:05.710 --> 00:04:05.720 
fishtail braids on these sides so I'm

00:04:05.720 --> 00:04:08.320 
fishtail braids on these sides so I'm
going<00:04:06.080> to<00:04:06.260> take<00:04:06.530> my<00:04:06.860> hair<00:04:07.160> into<00:04:07.640> two<00:04:07.880> separate

00:04:08.320 --> 00:04:08.330 
going to take my hair into two separate

00:04:08.330 --> 00:04:12.460 
going to take my hair into two separate
sections<00:04:08.680> and<00:04:10.810> basically<00:04:11.810> a<00:04:11.840> fishtail<00:04:12.260> is

00:04:12.460 --> 00:04:12.470 
sections and basically a fishtail is

00:04:12.470 --> 00:04:14.199 
sections and basically a fishtail is
just<00:04:12.650> taking<00:04:13.070> a<00:04:13.160> small<00:04:13.280> section<00:04:13.820> from<00:04:13.850> one

00:04:14.199 --> 00:04:14.209 
just taking a small section from one

00:04:14.209 --> 00:04:16.000 
just taking a small section from one
side<00:04:14.450> and<00:04:14.480> Criss<00:04:14.959> crossing<00:04:15.500> it<00:04:15.620> to<00:04:15.769> the<00:04:15.890> other

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:16.010 
side and Criss crossing it to the other

00:04:16.010 --> 00:04:19.449 
side and Criss crossing it to the other
it's<00:04:16.940> really<00:04:17.600> easy<00:04:17.959> to<00:04:18.140> do<00:04:18.470> honestly<00:04:18.950> it<00:04:19.430> just

00:04:19.449 --> 00:04:19.459 
it's really easy to do honestly it just

00:04:19.459 --> 00:04:22.210 
it's really easy to do honestly it just
takes<00:04:19.850> a<00:04:19.970> little<00:04:20.060> time<00:04:20.380> so<00:04:21.380> just<00:04:21.650> one<00:04:21.890> section

00:04:22.210 --> 00:04:22.220 
takes a little time so just one section

00:04:22.220 --> 00:04:23.909 
takes a little time so just one section
at<00:04:22.580> a<00:04:22.700> time

00:04:23.909 --> 00:04:23.919 
at a time

00:04:23.919 --> 00:04:27.900 
at a time
crisscross<00:04:24.919> it<00:04:25.190> over<00:04:25.490> keep<00:04:26.030> doing<00:04:26.360> that

00:04:27.900 --> 00:04:27.910 
crisscross it over keep doing that

00:04:27.910 --> 00:04:30.920 
crisscross it over keep doing that
criss-cross<00:04:28.390> criss-cross<00:04:29.200> all<00:04:29.530> the<00:04:29.830> way<00:04:30.010> down

00:04:30.920 --> 00:04:30.930 
criss-cross criss-cross all the way down

00:04:30.930 --> 00:04:33.540 
criss-cross criss-cross all the way down
so<00:04:31.930> a<00:04:31.960> small<00:04:32.230> section<00:04:32.500> over<00:04:33.190> to<00:04:33.340> the<00:04:33.430> other

00:04:33.540 --> 00:04:33.550 
so a small section over to the other

00:04:33.550 --> 00:04:37.140 
so a small section over to the other
side<00:04:34.830> section<00:04:35.830> from<00:04:36.070> here<00:04:36.400> over<00:04:36.640> to<00:04:36.790> the<00:04:37.000> other

00:04:37.140 --> 00:04:37.150 
side section from here over to the other

00:04:37.150 --> 00:04:39.090 
side section from here over to the other

00:04:48.090 --> 00:04:48.100 
whole section here and I'm gonna tie it

00:04:48.100 --> 00:04:51.270 
whole section here and I'm gonna tie it
off<00:04:48.280> with<00:04:48.310> a<00:04:49.230> hair<00:04:50.230> band<00:04:50.260> or<00:04:50.740> whatever<00:04:51.160> you

call<00:04:51.460> them<00:04:51.520> and<00:04:52.500> probably<00:04:53.500> the<00:04:53.590> best<00:04:53.740> idea

00:04:53.970 --> 00:04:53.980 
call them and probably the best idea

00:04:53.980 --> 00:04:56.010 
call them and probably the best idea
would<00:04:54.100> be<00:04:54.370> to<00:04:54.550> do<00:04:54.760> this<00:04:54.940> with<00:04:55.300> it<00:04:55.420> clear<00:04:55.660> one<00:04:55.840> I

00:04:56.010 --> 00:04:56.020 
would be to do this with it clear one I

00:04:56.020 --> 00:04:58.440 
would be to do this with it clear one I
just<00:04:56.290> don't<00:04:56.440> have<00:04:56.680> one<00:04:57.280> at<00:04:57.430> the<00:04:57.520> time<00:04:57.700> but<00:04:58.330> go

00:04:58.440 --> 00:04:58.450 
just don't have one at the time but go

00:04:58.450 --> 00:05:01.290 
just don't have one at the time but go
ahead<00:04:58.510> and<00:04:58.720> just<00:04:58.870> tie<00:04:59.140> that<00:04:59.170> off<00:04:59.530> and<00:05:00.180> pull<00:05:01.180> it

00:05:01.290 --> 00:05:01.300 
ahead and just tie that off and pull it

00:05:01.300 --> 00:05:02.670 
ahead and just tie that off and pull it
tight<00:05:01.570> and<00:05:01.840> then<00:05:02.020> what<00:05:02.170> you<00:05:02.230> want<00:05:02.380> to<00:05:02.470> do<00:05:02.560> is

00:05:18.480 --> 00:05:18.490 
one whole side done so now I move to the

00:05:18.490 --> 00:05:20.700 
one whole side done so now I move to the
other<00:05:18.520> side<00:05:18.730> and<00:05:19.480> basically<00:05:19.990> it's<00:05:20.260> exactly

00:05:20.700 --> 00:05:20.710 
other side and basically it's exactly

00:05:20.710 --> 00:05:23.220 
other side and basically it's exactly
the<00:05:20.980> same<00:05:21.190> thing<00:05:21.250> you<00:05:22.240> just<00:05:22.480> take<00:05:22.810> your<00:05:23.020> hair

00:05:23.220 --> 00:05:23.230 
the same thing you just take your hair

00:05:23.230 --> 00:05:26.010 
the same thing you just take your hair
into<00:05:23.470> two<00:05:23.650> sections<00:05:23.680> and<00:05:24.840> starting<00:05:25.840> on<00:05:25.930> the

00:05:26.010 --> 00:05:26.020 
into two sections and starting on the

00:05:26.020 --> 00:05:29.160 
into two sections and starting on the
outside<00:05:26.440> of<00:05:26.560> the<00:05:26.680> hair<00:05:26.890> bring<00:05:27.580> it<00:05:27.700> over<00:05:28.420> to<00:05:29.020> the

00:05:29.160 --> 00:05:29.170 
outside of the hair bring it over to the

00:05:29.170 --> 00:05:33.000 
outside of the hair bring it over to the
other<00:05:29.380> section<00:05:30.130> and<00:05:30.690> crisscross<00:05:31.690> so<00:05:32.170> outside

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:33.010 
other section and crisscross so outside

00:05:33.010 --> 00:05:37.560 
other section and crisscross so outside
little<00:05:33.910> piece<00:05:34.150> here<00:05:35.850> and<00:05:36.850> I'm<00:05:37.000> gonna<00:05:37.120> cross<00:05:37.540> it

00:05:37.560 --> 00:05:37.570 
little piece here and I'm gonna cross it

00:05:37.570 --> 00:05:43.200 
little piece here and I'm gonna cross it
over<00:05:41.130> and<00:05:42.130> kind<00:05:42.370> of<00:05:42.400> every<00:05:42.670> time<00:05:42.910> pull<00:05:43.180> it

00:05:43.200 --> 00:05:43.210 
over and kind of every time pull it

00:05:43.210 --> 00:05:47.580 
over and kind of every time pull it
tight<00:05:43.770> just<00:05:44.770> to<00:05:45.300> make<00:05:46.300> sure<00:05:46.330> that<00:05:46.660> it's<00:05:46.840> secure

00:05:47.580 --> 00:05:47.590 
tight just to make sure that it's secure

00:05:47.590 --> 00:05:51.720 
tight just to make sure that it's secure
so<00:05:48.580> bring<00:05:48.910> one<00:05:49.210> piece<00:05:49.750> to<00:05:50.169> the<00:05:50.860> other<00:05:51.070> section

00:05:51.720 --> 00:05:51.730 
so bring one piece to the other section

00:05:51.730 --> 00:05:55.620 
so bring one piece to the other section
and<00:05:52.000> then<00:05:53.340> crisscross<00:05:54.340> and<00:05:55.240> you<00:05:55.360> can<00:05:55.510> really

00:05:55.620 --> 00:05:55.630 
and then crisscross and you can really

00:05:55.630 --> 00:05:59.070 
and then crisscross and you can really
decide<00:05:56.080> on<00:05:56.500> whatever<00:05:57.310> size<00:05:57.760> you<00:05:58.720> want<00:05:58.930> your

00:05:59.070 --> 00:05:59.080 
decide on whatever size you want your

00:05:59.080 --> 00:06:02.880 
decide on whatever size you want your
little<00:05:59.230> sections<00:05:59.740> to<00:06:00.070> be<00:06:01.140> you<00:06:02.140> know<00:06:02.260> smaller

00:06:02.880 --> 00:06:02.890 
little sections to be you know smaller

00:06:02.890 --> 00:06:06.120 
little sections to be you know smaller
the<00:06:03.430> more<00:06:03.580> detail<00:06:04.060> the<00:06:04.240> fishtail<00:06:04.630> will<00:06:05.140> be<00:06:05.740> the

00:06:06.120 --> 00:06:06.130 
the more detail the fishtail will be the

00:06:06.130 --> 00:06:08.970 
the more detail the fishtail will be the
thicker<00:06:06.520> the<00:06:06.640> section<00:06:07.470> kind<00:06:08.470> of<00:06:08.530> less

00:06:08.970 --> 00:06:08.980 
thicker the section kind of less

00:06:08.980 --> 00:06:11.070 
thicker the section kind of less
detailed<00:06:09.460> I<00:06:09.610> guess<00:06:09.820> it<00:06:10.000> would<00:06:10.120> be<00:06:10.150> so<00:06:10.870> just

00:06:11.070 --> 00:06:11.080 
detailed I guess it would be so just

00:06:11.080 --> 00:06:13.500 
detailed I guess it would be so just
continue<00:06:11.860> doing<00:06:12.100> that<00:06:12.190> all<00:06:12.460> the<00:06:12.490> way<00:06:12.700> down<00:06:13.180> and
