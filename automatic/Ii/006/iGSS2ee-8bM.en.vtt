thumb for defensive structures is to

00:02:34.390 --> 00:02:36.090 
thumb for defensive structures is to
upgrade<00:02:34.720> your<00:02:34.810> defenses<00:02:35.410> so<00:02:35.680> that<00:02:35.830> they<00:02:35.920> can

00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:36.100 
upgrade your defenses so that they can

00:02:36.100 --> 00:02:37.860 
upgrade your defenses so that they can
catch<00:02:36.310> up<00:02:36.580> to<00:02:36.820> the<00:02:36.940> level<00:02:37.270> of<00:02:37.360> your<00:02:37.540> current

00:02:55.710 --> 00:02:55.720 
well you want to try and avoid upgrading

00:02:55.720 --> 00:02:57.690 
well you want to try and avoid upgrading
the<00:02:55.780> same<00:02:56.080> defensive<00:02:56.620> structure<00:02:56.980> at<00:02:57.130> the<00:02:57.520> same

00:03:00.240 --> 00:03:00.250 
time so for example I would not

00:03:00.250 --> 00:03:02.070 
time so for example I would not

00:03:42.900 --> 00:03:42.910 
carefully worked on builder optimization

00:03:42.910 --> 00:03:44.790 
carefully worked on builder optimization
which<00:03:43.510> I<00:03:43.630> also<00:03:43.810> talked<00:03:44.080> about<00:03:44.110> in<00:03:44.470> mind<00:03:44.650> what

00:03:44.790 --> 00:03:44.800 
which I also talked about in mind what

00:03:44.800 --> 00:03:46.890 
which I also talked about in mind what
defenses<00:03:45.280> upgrade<00:03:45.640> first<00:03:45.850> video<00:03:46.209> then

00:03:46.890 --> 00:03:46.900 
defenses upgrade first video then

00:03:46.900 --> 00:03:48.270 
defenses upgrade first video then
hopefully<00:03:47.320> you'll<00:03:47.470> be<00:03:47.500> spacing<00:03:48.010> out<00:03:48.070> your

00:03:48.270 --> 00:03:48.280 
hopefully you'll be spacing out your

hopefully you'll be spacing out your
builders<00:03:48.610> effectively<00:03:49.410> basically<00:03:50.410> what

00:03:50.550 --> 00:03:50.560 
builders effectively basically what

00:03:50.560 --> 00:03:52.470 
builders effectively basically what
builder<00:03:50.860> optimization<00:03:51.550> comes<00:03:51.790> down<00:03:52.030> to<00:03:52.239> is

00:03:52.470 --> 00:03:52.480 
builder optimization comes down to is

00:03:52.480 --> 00:03:54.449 
builder optimization comes down to is
making<00:03:53.110> sure<00:03:53.290> all<00:03:53.500> five<00:03:53.830> of<00:03:53.860> your<00:03:54.070> builders

00:03:54.449 --> 00:03:54.459 
making sure all five of your builders

00:03:54.459 --> 00:03:56.460 
making sure all five of your builders
don't<00:03:54.790> become<00:03:55.180> available<00:03:55.750> on<00:03:55.870> the<00:03:55.989> same<00:03:56.230> day
