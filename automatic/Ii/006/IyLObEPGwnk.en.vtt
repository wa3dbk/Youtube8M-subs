00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:47.870
 so ran cache found it 

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:47.870
 reading a newspaper on a flower meadow 

00:00:49.730 --> 00:01:02.649
 overexposure or cache 

00:00:53.329 --> 00:01:06.500
 oh hello what happened because 

00:01:02.649 --> 00:01:09.890
 well , everyone should be able to count therefore 

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:11.960
 let's learn it is even easy 

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:16.729

 it was right and how you thought so 

00:01:21.110 --> 00:01:28.360
 at least once and it turns out well done figure 1 

00:01:25.610 --> 00:01:28.360
 is written like this 

00:01:32.830 --> 00:01:38.020

00:01:36.550 --> 00:01:39.909
 points which succeeded one 

00:01:38.020 --> 00:01:44.560
 just count 

00:01:39.909 --> 00:01:47.700
 and so 1d 

00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:52.649
 due to how many times the clouds where i 

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:52.649
