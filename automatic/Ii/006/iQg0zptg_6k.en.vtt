00:02:18.709 --> 00:02:20.800 
with something inside the screen yes it
does<00:02:18.770> it<00:02:19.730> comes<00:02:19.910> with<00:02:20.030> this<00:02:20.209> little<00:02:20.270> bitty

00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:20.810 
does it comes with this little bitty

00:02:20.810 --> 00:02:23.020 
does it comes with this little bitty
piece<00:02:21.110> of<00:02:21.290> fog<00:02:21.470> it's<00:02:22.190> not<00:02:22.280> really<00:02:22.430> cloth<00:02:22.790> it's

00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:27.230 
it's nice and soft and what I was

00:02:27.230 --> 00:02:30.160 
it's nice and soft and what I was
thinking<00:02:27.470> was<00:02:27.560> this<00:02:27.680> Apple<00:02:28.280> is<00:02:28.430> not<00:02:29.080> going<00:02:30.080> to

00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:30.170 
thinking was this Apple is not going to

00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:32.170 
thinking was this Apple is not going to
put<00:02:30.489> something<00:02:31.489> that's<00:02:31.730> going<00:02:31.819> to<00:02:31.880> scratch

00:02:32.170 --> 00:02:32.180 
put something that's going to scratch

00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:34.180 
put something that's going to scratch
their<00:02:32.480> screens<00:02:32.810> up<00:02:33.020> it<00:02:33.260> in<00:02:33.470> between<00:02:33.980> the

00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:34.190 
their screens up it in between the

00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:36.610 
their screens up it in between the
keyboard<00:02:34.340> of<00:02:34.640> screen<00:02:35.200> so<00:02:36.200> this<00:02:36.350> is<00:02:36.500> like

00:02:36.610 --> 00:02:36.620 
keyboard of screen so this is like

00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:39.160 
keyboard of screen so this is like
probably<00:02:36.830> the<00:02:37.130> cheapest<00:02:37.760> way<00:02:38.000> java<00:02:38.840> picture

00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:39.170 
probably the cheapest way java picture

00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:41.140 
probably the cheapest way java picture
this<00:02:39.319> to<00:02:39.500> the<00:02:39.650> cheapest<00:02:40.100> way<00:02:40.250> to<00:02:40.280> keep<00:02:40.760> your

00:02:41.140 --> 00:02:41.150 
this to the cheapest way to keep your

00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:44.229 
this to the cheapest way to keep your
macbook<00:02:41.569> clean<00:02:41.900> keep<00:02:42.680> it<00:02:42.800> unscratched<00:02:43.489> when

00:02:44.229 --> 00:02:44.239 
macbook clean keep it unscratched when

00:02:44.239 --> 00:02:46.900 
macbook clean keep it unscratched when
you<00:02:44.330> close<00:02:44.569> it<00:02:44.920> so<00:02:45.920> I<00:02:46.220> think<00:02:46.340> that's<00:02:46.640> actually

00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:46.910 
you close it so I think that's actually

00:02:46.910 --> 00:02:48.460 
you close it so I think that's actually
what<00:02:47.269> I'll<00:02:47.360> start<00:02:47.630> using<00:02:47.810> when<00:02:47.959> I<00:02:48.080> close<00:02:48.350> my

00:02:48.460 --> 00:02:48.470 
what I'll start using when I close my

00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:50.229 
what I'll start using when I close my
macbook<00:02:48.890> and<00:02:49.040> set<00:02:49.280> it<00:02:49.400> down<00:02:49.489> for<00:02:49.760> the<00:02:49.820> night<00:02:50.000> or

there to keep the dust from getting

00:02:53.989 --> 00:02:55.570 
there to keep the dust from getting
through<00:02:54.200> the<00:02:54.320> keys<00:02:54.560> get<00:02:54.920> keeping<00:02:55.370> it<00:02:55.489> from

00:02:55.570 --> 00:02:55.580 
through the keys get keeping it from

00:02:55.580 --> 00:02:58.090 
through the keys get keeping it from
getting<00:02:55.700> on<00:02:55.910> the<00:02:56.000> screen<00:02:56.830> so<00:02:57.830> pretty<00:02:58.040> much

00:02:58.090 --> 00:02:58.100 
getting on the screen so pretty much

00:02:58.100 --> 00:03:01.330 
getting on the screen so pretty much
those<00:02:58.670> are<00:02:58.970> the<00:02:59.209> two<00:02:59.600> cheap<00:03:00.319> things<00:03:00.709> cheap

00:03:01.330 --> 00:03:01.340 
those are the two cheap things cheap

00:03:01.340 --> 00:03:05.080 
those are the two cheap things cheap
easy<00:03:02.410> not<00:03:03.410> too<00:03:03.709> tacky<00:03:04.190> things<00:03:04.430> that<00:03:04.670> I<00:03:04.700> figured

00:03:05.080 --> 00:03:05.090 
easy not too tacky things that I figured

00:03:05.090 --> 00:03:07.890 
easy not too tacky things that I figured
out<00:03:05.209> what<00:03:05.360> to<00:03:05.450> do<00:03:05.600> to<00:03:06.560> save<00:03:06.769> yourself<00:03:07.280> about

00:03:07.890 --> 00:03:07.900 
out what to do to save yourself about

00:03:07.900 --> 00:03:10.449 
out what to do to save yourself about
ninety<00:03:08.900> dollars<00:03:09.050> about<00:03:09.890> seventy<00:03:10.310> to<00:03:10.430> ninety

00:03:10.449 --> 00:03:10.459 
ninety dollars about seventy to ninety

00:03:10.459 --> 00:03:13.270 
ninety dollars about seventy to ninety
dollars<00:03:10.819> and<00:03:11.269> it<00:03:11.510> saved<00:03:11.780> me<00:03:11.930> a<00:03:12.019> bunch<00:03:12.260> and<00:03:12.650> I

00:03:13.270 --> 00:03:13.280 
dollars and it saved me a bunch and I

00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:16.000 
dollars and it saved me a bunch and I
think<00:03:13.370> this<00:03:13.700> is<00:03:13.760> how<00:03:13.970> I'll<00:03:14.120> keep<00:03:14.330> it<00:03:14.680> now<00:03:15.680> I<00:03:15.709> can

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:16.010 
think this is how I'll keep it now I can

00:03:16.010 --> 00:03:18.460 
think this is how I'll keep it now I can
pretty<00:03:16.640> much<00:03:16.760> stick<00:03:17.300> anything<00:03:17.330> on<00:03:17.900> this<00:03:18.110> stand

pretty much stick anything on this stand

00:03:18.470 --> 00:03:22.000 
pretty much stick anything on this stand
and<00:03:18.880> not<00:03:19.880> worry<00:03:20.450> about<00:03:20.799> damaging<00:03:21.799> something

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:22.010 
and not worry about damaging something

00:03:22.010 --> 00:03:23.110

00:03:23.110 --> 00:03:23.120 
that I've spent a lot of money on

00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:26.050 
that I've spent a lot of money on
