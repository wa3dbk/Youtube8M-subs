00:00:01.229 --> 00:00:04.229
 Bermatingen best German there are even rumors 

00:00:04.880 --> 00:00:07.140
 Dudars in Innsbruck continue jumping dpa 

00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:08.979
 he should be Kurt r Dr 

00:00:08.979 --> 00:00:12.009
 besides, of course, the invitation is thankful to 

00:00:12.579 --> 00:00:16.910
 Fun aside today with deficit history actually that in qualifying 

00:00:16.910 --> 00:00:19.519
 so jumped until the leak is the FranÃ§ois 

00:00:19.519 --> 00:00:22.519
 He is already known as the driver of World Cup points 

00:00:23.329 --> 00:00:25.329
 Dr 

00:00:25.329 --> 00:00:27.640
 yes, it was a difficult competition 2 

00:00:27.640 --> 00:00:31.960
 The beautiful quality was not so much lost sight of 

00:00:31.960 --> 00:00:35.809
 Parents big that some restless got hit by the wind and finally what's there 

00:00:35.809 --> 00:00:37.600
 now only stronger and 

00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:42.230
 have according to Severity degree course of competition around Moscow contactor 

00:00:43.150 --> 00:00:46.020
 Degree so that my booklet has brought through but of course 

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:47.340
 as you wish 

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:48.300
 the top one 

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:50.760
 l still down or up again 

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:53.850
 because what would a feeling have said if you are now in the 

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:55.149
 Responsibility very serious 

00:00:55.149 --> 00:00:57.760
 and the wind in the zoo too 

00:00:57.760 --> 00:01:02.120
 If the experienced Martin Schmidt acted, he would have said the end of the cover 

00:01:02.120 --> 00:01:04.680
 abort or what would Martin Schmidt have said 

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:08.830
 in the East all the pages are now so busy with them I am 

00:01:08.830 --> 00:01:12.630
 quite a lot into our cabin so as to mitigate expenses 

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:16.600
 back to design worlds thus connecting with them I wanted to deal with 

00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:19.820
 do not prepare for a possible second jump because if so 

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:24.610
 there has to be more there around 59 itself visible between oil drilling wind 

00:01:24.610 --> 00:01:28.980
 So I should be able to think about it, that's why I think I'm right 

00:01:28.980 --> 00:01:30.350
 around 

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:34.310
 Marte Marte has the feeling that it has that at least so far under control 

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:37.520
 is finished with the Kofler what certainly but very close to the border 

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:42.020
 he and then fall avoid frame but who so what do you want 

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:43.780
 Of course not on his side 

00:01:43.780 --> 00:01:47.260
 which is probably always to competitions but I think only 

00:01:47.260 --> 00:01:49.499
 Painter way I always have the attitude about 

00:01:49.499 --> 00:01:52.330
 to cancel too early too late 

00:01:52.330 --> 00:01:53.600
 go before the tour 

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:57.610
 you were not so sure what percentage can Martin Schmitz "Now you can see 

00:01:57.610 --> 00:02:00.720
 little security what is to be expected 

00:02:00.720 --> 00:02:04.980
 So let's see Rahman so I have with as well as stable form Morales whole 

00:02:04.980 --> 00:02:06.689
 understandably runs quietly 

00:02:06.689 --> 00:02:10.629
 for normal with the worse jump still insured the 

00:02:10.629 --> 00:02:12.780
 the best ten come Aarauer Genth 

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:17.160
 That's why I have to keep my things together Habemus near Sestak 

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:18.310
 but needs to focus 

00:02:18.310 --> 00:02:20.830
 because losing to the front for looseness so that is 

00:02:20.830 --> 00:02:26.400
 Percent to this simple but the game makes Bad Reichenhall and around there Marie AR 

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:29.700
 just keep going and maybe yes, I'll succeed again 

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:33.880
 how about dementia just who could that also the market share reached so 2 2 

00:02:33.880 --> 00:02:35.490
 dear Assistant Dr
