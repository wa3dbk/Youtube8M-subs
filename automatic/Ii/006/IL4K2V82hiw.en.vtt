00:05:40.610 --> 00:05:40.620 
of this car my favorite feature of the

00:05:40.620 --> 00:05:44.030 
of this car my favorite feature of the
car<00:05:40.860> is<00:05:41.400> certainly<00:05:41.970> the<00:05:42.530> push<00:05:43.530> button<00:05:43.860> start

00:05:44.030 --> 00:05:44.040 
car is certainly the push button start

00:05:44.040 --> 00:05:46.129 
car is certainly the push button start
but<00:05:44.580> I<00:05:44.610> think<00:05:44.850> a<00:05:44.910> close<00:05:45.210> second<00:05:45.660> is<00:05:45.810> just<00:05:45.840> the

00:05:46.129 --> 00:05:46.139 
but I think a close second is just the

00:05:46.139 --> 00:05:48.650 
but I think a close second is just the
sound<00:05:46.470> of<00:05:46.760> the<00:05:47.760> car<00:05:48.000> makes<00:05:48.270> when<00:05:48.540> it's

00:05:48.650 --> 00:05:48.660 
sound of the car makes when it's

00:05:48.660 --> 00:05:51.890 
sound of the car makes when it's
shifting<00:05:49.139> yeah<00:05:49.590> just<00:05:50.070> it<00:05:50.730> just<00:05:50.760> sounds<00:05:51.300> just

00:05:51.890 --> 00:05:51.900 
shifting yeah just it just sounds just

00:05:51.900 --> 00:05:54.020 
shifting yeah just it just sounds just
perfect<00:05:52.020> to<00:05:52.560> me<00:05:52.680> and<00:05:52.830> just<00:05:53.010> sporty<00:05:53.460> enough<00:05:53.790> to

00:05:54.020 --> 00:05:54.030 
perfect to me and just sporty enough to

00:05:54.030 --> 00:05:55.550 
perfect to me and just sporty enough to
kind<00:05:54.360> of<00:05:54.419> say

00:05:55.550 --> 00:05:55.560 
kind of say

00:05:55.560 --> 00:05:59.540 
kind of say
probably<00:05:56.310> pretty<00:05:56.490> cool<00:05:58.010> we<00:05:59.010> can<00:05:59.130> gun<00:05:59.370> it<00:05:59.460> a

00:05:59.540 --> 00:05:59.550 
probably pretty cool we can gun it a

00:05:59.550 --> 00:06:03.500 
probably pretty cool we can gun it a
little<00:05:59.760> bit<00:05:59.970> up<00:06:00.180> to<00:06:00.330> the<00:06:00.419> light

00:06:03.500 --> 00:06:03.510 

00:06:03.510 --> 00:06:04.670 

then<00:06:03.690> it's<00:06:03.870> trade<00:06:04.080> that<00:06:04.200> has<00:06:04.290> got<00:06:04.470> enough
