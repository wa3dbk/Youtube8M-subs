00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.570
 seventh stage of the rally sonangol marathon africa 

00:00:02.570 --> 00:00:05.250
 bark from 2013 promised to be one of the most 

00:00:05.250 --> 00:00:07.690
 speed race at all because the length 

00:00:07.690 --> 00:00:10.260
 the stage is 648 kilometers of which 

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:12.729
 437 combat 

00:00:12.729 --> 00:00:14.929
 go faster at the beginning of the track then 

00:00:14.929 --> 00:00:16.480
 after experiencing a few small 

00:00:16.480 --> 00:00:19.740
 dion again gives way to flat sections 

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:21.860
 and only at the end of the stone and 

00:00:21.860 --> 00:00:24.860
 cut with Viennese soil 

00:00:31.449 --> 00:00:33.260
 already at the start stage began 

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:34.379
 surprises 

00:00:34.379 --> 00:00:37.079
 race leader genre and that wed typing fast 

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:39.089
 speed just as quickly returned to 

00:00:39.089 --> 00:00:39.749
 the start 

00:00:39.749 --> 00:00:41.569
 because his car failed 

00:00:41.569 --> 00:00:42.820
 device with 

00:00:42.820 --> 00:00:45.000
 resolution problem in no more than three 

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:45.670
 minutes 

00:00:45.670 --> 00:00:47.739
 but during this time managed to start to mars 

00:00:47.739 --> 00:00:49.949
 Anton was wrong and Volkswagen however 

00:00:49.949 --> 00:00:51.170
 top quality medals 

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:53.070
 and the further course of the race became 

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:54.250
 unpredictable 

00:00:54.250 --> 00:00:56.430
 the stops were overshadowed by the passage 

00:00:56.430 --> 00:00:58.690
 slopes for bank avant-garde cable best man 

00:00:58.690 --> 00:01:01.690
 grill this and even for our site 

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:12.790
 it was hard for the press 

00:01:12.790 --> 00:01:15.219
 truck man or for budget shemtov 

00:01:15.219 --> 00:01:17.369
 she stuck on the last third 

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:19.389
 distance and skipped ahead 

00:01:19.389 --> 00:01:21.889
 almost all of its competitors 

00:01:21.889 --> 00:01:23.429
 here is the KAMAZ crew again 

00:01:23.429 --> 00:01:24.590
 demonstrated amazing 

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:27.219
 stability and craftsmanship showing 

00:01:27.219 --> 00:01:29.790
 first truck results 

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:32.700
 only the legendary desert fox that wed 

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:35.060
 managed to beat Anton Shuvalov 

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:36.979
 but only for a minute and a half 

00:01:36.979 --> 00:01:39.479
 the truck have not easy with 

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:41.560
 SUV speed for the garden 

00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:42.950
 on separate sites 

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:45.610
 exceeded 160 kilometers per hour 

00:01:45.610 --> 00:01:47.760
 and trucks have a limiter 

00:01:47.760 --> 00:01:50.020
 speeds of up to one hundred and fifty very 

00:01:50.020 --> 00:01:51.600
 heavy sands 

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:54.460
 like they are small but very viscous but 

00:01:54.460 --> 00:01:56.009
 the words overcame without even leaving 

00:01:56.009 --> 00:01:57.220
 cockpit project 

00:01:57.220 --> 00:02:00.000
 for us for the first time such training Roman 

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:02.420
 the task of the Janar will push away from the group 

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:04.470
 I hope that will be with good Anton 

00:02:04.470 --> 00:02:06.230
 Demidov and Sergey Mishin team 

00:02:06.230 --> 00:02:08.410

00:02:08.410 --> 00:02:10.300
 second time on the special stage among 

00:02:10.300 --> 00:02:12.570
 SUVs and fourth in the absolute 

00:02:12.570 --> 00:02:15.070
 with a gap from the leader of all at the gas station minutes 29 

00:02:15.070 --> 00:02:15.980
 seconds 

00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:18.340
 it is very different Mauritian from 

00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:20.470
 what we saw earlier yesterday so size with 

00:02:20.470 --> 00:02:22.500
 whom were today the regions and so far 

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:23.980
 a little useful but the most interesting 

00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:27.110
 here in front of the third place she gave a major 

00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:29.149
 starting number 222 

00:02:29.149 --> 00:02:31.289
 in the top five among SUVs also 

00:02:31.289 --> 00:02:33.329
 entered peace ban would see on 

00:02:33.329 --> 00:02:34.129
 one day 

00:02:34.129 --> 00:02:36.609
 among trucks second position at home 

00:02:36.609 --> 00:02:38.989
 same house chicago third glushkov h 

00:02:38.989 --> 00:02:41.069
 at the end of the seventh stage, the top five 

00:02:41.069 --> 00:02:43.090
 in the absolute now looks like 

00:02:43.090 --> 00:02:44.159
 way 

00:02:44.159 --> 00:02:46.150
 just over 20 after big 

00:02:46.150 --> 00:02:47.299
 break 

00:02:47.299 --> 00:02:49.749
 two Russian crews in the lead 

00:02:49.749 --> 00:02:52.099
 international rally marathon 

00:02:52.099 --> 00:02:54.639
 the next eighth stage of the race and includes 

00:02:54.639 --> 00:02:57.180
 in a special stage length of 320 

00:02:57.180 --> 00:02:58.959
 I will tell kilometers in vicinities 

00:02:58.959 --> 00:03:00.329
 what's in Mauritania 

00:03:00.329 --> 00:03:03.189
 and there is no reason to believe in 

00:03:03.189 --> 00:03:04.330
 that time astana 

00:03:04.330 --> 00:03:04.740
 simpler
