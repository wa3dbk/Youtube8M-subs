00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:31.350 
I'm trying to work on getting it and I'm

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:34.399 
I'm trying to work on getting it and I'm
almost<00:01:31.500> there<00:01:31.799> so<00:01:32.240> let's<00:01:33.240> get<00:01:33.360> started<00:01:33.750> when

00:01:34.399 --> 00:01:34.409 
almost there so let's get started when

00:01:34.409 --> 00:01:37.310 
almost there so let's get started when
you're<00:01:34.560> using<00:01:34.770> a<00:01:35.009> submachine<00:01:35.610> gun<00:01:36.320> always

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:37.320 
you're using a submachine gun always

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:39.830 
you're using a submachine gun always
always<00:01:37.590> always<00:01:37.950> be<00:01:38.400> sure<00:01:39.090> to<00:01:39.119> use<00:01:39.390> the<00:01:39.600> laser

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:39.840 
always always be sure to use the laser

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:43.090 
always always be sure to use the laser
sight<00:01:40.729> while<00:01:41.729> trying<00:01:42.119> to<00:01:42.240> go<00:01:42.329> for<00:01:42.479> headshots

00:01:43.090 --> 00:01:43.100 
sight while trying to go for headshots

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:45.530 
sight while trying to go for headshots
because<00:01:44.100> the<00:01:44.220> laser<00:01:44.369> sight<00:01:44.729> obviously<00:01:45.420> is

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:45.540 
because the laser sight obviously is

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:47.179 
because the laser sight obviously is
made<00:01:45.750> for<00:01:46.020> when<00:01:46.290> you<00:01:46.380> hipfire<00:01:46.860> with<00:01:47.070> the

00:01:47.179 --> 00:01:47.189 
made for when you hipfire with the

00:01:47.189 --> 00:01:49.460 
made for when you hipfire with the
submachine<00:01:47.610> gun<00:01:47.790> and<00:01:48.060> if<00:01:48.600> you<00:01:48.840> do<00:01:49.020> use<00:01:49.290> the

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:49.470 
submachine gun and if you do use the

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:51.530 
submachine gun and if you do use the
submachine<00:01:49.890> guns<00:01:50.070> properly<00:01:50.610> you<00:01:51.090> should

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:51.540 
submachine guns properly you should

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:53.240 
submachine guns properly you should
probably<00:01:51.810> be<00:01:52.170> hit<00:01:52.439> firing<00:01:52.829> before<00:01:52.979> you

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:53.250 
probably be hit firing before you

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:56.359 
probably be hit firing before you
actually<00:01:53.430> shoot<00:01:54.649> now<00:01:55.649> this<00:01:55.860> helps<00:01:56.070> obviously

00:01:56.359 --> 00:01:56.369 
actually shoot now this helps obviously

00:01:56.369 --> 00:01:59.980 
actually shoot now this helps obviously
because<00:01:57.149> of<00:01:57.180> the<00:01:57.509> laser<00:01:57.719> that<00:01:58.350> it<00:01:58.560> projects

00:01:59.980 --> 00:01:59.990 
because of the laser that it projects

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:02.959 
because of the laser that it projects
which<00:02:01.130> obviously<00:02:02.130> you're<00:02:02.399> going<00:02:02.490> to<00:02:02.549> try<00:02:02.820> and

00:02:02.959 --> 00:02:02.969 
which obviously you're going to try and

00:02:02.969 --> 00:02:07.389 
which obviously you're going to try and
aim<00:02:03.210> that<00:02:03.479> laser<00:02:03.750> for<00:02:04.649> the<00:02:04.710> enemy's<00:02:05.310> head

00:02:07.389 --> 00:02:07.399 
aim that laser for the enemy's head

00:02:07.399 --> 00:02:10.249 
aim that laser for the enemy's head
which<00:02:08.399> helps<00:02:08.910> much<00:02:09.149> more<00:02:09.479> than<00:02:09.690> just<00:02:09.720> trying

00:02:10.249 --> 00:02:10.259 
which helps much more than just trying

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:13.730 
which helps much more than just trying
to<00:02:10.319> hipfire<00:02:11.180> randomly<00:02:12.209> aiming<00:02:12.900> for<00:02:13.020> the<00:02:13.140> head

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:13.740 
to hipfire randomly aiming for the head

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:15.920 
to hipfire randomly aiming for the head
because<00:02:14.310> obviously<00:02:14.640> we'll<00:02:15.270> be<00:02:15.360> more<00:02:15.510> accurate

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:15.930 
because obviously we'll be more accurate

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:19.340 
because obviously we'll be more accurate
with<00:02:16.050> it<00:02:16.520> other<00:02:17.520> than<00:02:17.790> the<00:02:18.390> laser<00:02:18.600> sight<00:02:18.900> for

00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:19.350 
with it other than the laser sight for

00:02:19.350 --> 00:02:22.040 
with it other than the laser sight for
these<00:02:19.530> submachine<00:02:20.190> guns<00:02:20.430> I<00:02:20.700> would<00:02:21.540> recommend

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:22.050 
these submachine guns I would recommend

00:02:22.050 --> 00:02:26.030 
these submachine guns I would recommend
on<00:02:22.580> the<00:02:23.580> reflex<00:02:24.570> sight<00:02:24.990> if<00:02:25.200> you<00:02:25.470> guys<00:02:25.620> really

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:26.040 
on the reflex sight if you guys really

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:30.020 
on the reflex sight if you guys really
want<00:02:26.490> to<00:02:27.800> play<00:02:28.800> more<00:02:29.070> defensive<00:02:29.610> role<00:02:29.640> with

00:02:30.020 --> 00:02:30.030 
want to play more defensive role with

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:31.280 
want to play more defensive role with
this<00:02:30.120> on<00:02:30.300> machining<00:02:30.630> on<00:02:30.720> the<00:02:30.810> reflex<00:02:31.200> sight

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:31.290 
this on machining on the reflex sight

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:34.040 
this on machining on the reflex sight
and<00:02:31.880> the<00:02:32.880> other<00:02:33.090> attachment<00:02:33.690> would<00:02:33.780> be<00:02:33.900> the

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:34.050 
and the other attachment would be the

00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:38.690 
and the other attachment would be the
for<00:02:34.380> grip<00:02:35.090> for<00:02:36.090> the<00:02:36.270> submachine<00:02:36.720> guns<00:02:37.700> really

00:02:38.690 --> 00:02:38.700 
for grip for the submachine guns really

00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:40.520 
for grip for the submachine guns really
if<00:02:38.880> I<00:02:39.030> were<00:02:39.060> to<00:02:39.270> recommend<00:02:39.420> the<00:02:39.720> class<00:02:39.960> I<00:02:40.200> would

00:02:40.520 --> 00:02:40.530 
if I were to recommend the class I would

00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:42.260 
if I were to recommend the class I would
definitely<00:02:41.070> choose<00:02:41.280> the<00:02:41.490> laser<00:02:41.730> sight<00:02:42.060> and

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:42.270 
definitely choose the laser sight and

00:02:42.270 --> 00:02:45.290 
definitely choose the laser sight and
the<00:02:42.480> for<00:02:42.720> grip<00:02:42.980> for<00:02:43.980> going<00:02:44.340> for<00:02:44.760> the<00:02:44.940> golden

00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:45.300 
the for grip for going for the golden

00:02:45.300 --> 00:02:47.240 
the for grip for going for the golden
camo<00:02:45.750> I<00:02:45.780> do<00:02:45.930> have<00:02:46.140> the<00:02:46.230> golden<00:02:46.530> camo<00:02:46.770> for<00:02:46.920> the

00:02:47.240 --> 00:02:47.250 
camo I do have the golden camo for the

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:51.590 
camo I do have the golden camo for the
PDW<00:02:47.940> here<00:02:49.640> obviously<00:02:50.640> once<00:02:51.180> you<00:02:51.330> get<00:02:51.480> the

00:02:51.590 --> 00:02:51.600 
PDW here obviously once you get the

00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:54.710 
PDW here obviously once you get the
cryptic<00:02:52.170> -<00:02:52.710> camo<00:02:53.280> which<00:02:53.580> is<00:02:53.760> a<00:02:53.940> hundred<00:02:54.510> head

00:02:54.710 --> 00:02:54.720 
cryptic - camo which is a hundred head

00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:56.690 
cryptic - camo which is a hundred head
shots<00:02:54.990> you<00:02:55.290> unlock<00:02:55.680> these<00:02:55.980> challenges<00:02:56.580> that

00:02:56.690 --> 00:02:56.700 
shots you unlock these challenges that

00:02:56.700 --> 00:02:58.880 
shots you unlock these challenges that
you<00:02:56.790> have<00:02:56.940> to<00:02:56.970> complete<00:02:57.470> which<00:02:58.470> as<00:02:58.710> you<00:02:58.860> can

00:02:58.880 --> 00:02:58.890 
you have to complete which as you can

00:02:58.890 --> 00:03:01.880 
you have to complete which as you can
read<00:02:59.280> them<00:02:59.520> here<00:03:00.090> I<00:03:00.480> you<00:03:01.470> can<00:03:01.620> get<00:03:01.740> these

00:03:01.880 --> 00:03:01.890 
read them here I you can get these

00:03:01.890 --> 00:03:05.360 
read them here I you can get these
pretty<00:03:02.160> quickly<00:03:02.990> but<00:03:04.010> basically<00:03:05.010> the<00:03:05.160> hard

00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:05.370 
pretty quickly but basically the hard

00:03:05.370 --> 00:03:07.100 
pretty quickly but basically the hard
part<00:03:05.610> is<00:03:05.850> going<00:03:06.060> for<00:03:06.330> the<00:03:06.420> hundred<00:03:06.720> head<00:03:06.840> shots

00:03:07.100 --> 00:03:07.110 
part is going for the hundred head shots

00:03:07.110 --> 00:03:08.930 
part is going for the hundred head shots
but<00:03:07.410> for<00:03:07.620> some<00:03:07.740> machine<00:03:08.010> guns<00:03:08.040> I<00:03:08.400> definitely

00:03:08.930 --> 00:03:08.940 
but for some machine guns I definitely

00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:10.970 
but for some machine guns I definitely
recommend<00:03:09.180> just<00:03:09.600> aiming<00:03:10.020> for<00:03:10.140> the<00:03:10.230> head<00:03:10.440> with

00:03:10.970 --> 00:03:10.980 
recommend just aiming for the head with

00:03:10.980 --> 00:03:14.090 
recommend just aiming for the head with
the<00:03:11.160> laser<00:03:11.340> sight<00:03:12.440> moving<00:03:13.440> on<00:03:13.560> to<00:03:13.680> assault

00:03:14.090 --> 00:03:14.100 
the laser sight moving on to assault

00:03:14.100 --> 00:03:16.880 
the laser sight moving on to assault
rifles<00:03:14.660> now<00:03:15.660> here's<00:03:16.050> where<00:03:16.200> we<00:03:16.260> get<00:03:16.470> into<00:03:16.650> a

00:03:16.880 --> 00:03:16.890 
rifles now here's where we get into a

00:03:16.890 --> 00:03:19.610 
rifles now here's where we get into a
little<00:03:17.190> bit<00:03:17.310> more<00:03:17.580> complicated<00:03:18.620> -

00:03:19.610 --> 00:03:19.620 
little bit more complicated -

00:03:19.620 --> 00:03:21.200 
little bit more complicated -
attachments<00:03:20.310> that<00:03:20.340> you<00:03:20.460> may<00:03:20.730> think<00:03:21.060> would

00:03:21.200 --> 00:03:21.210 
attachments that you may think would

00:03:21.210 --> 00:03:24.380 
attachments that you may think would
help<00:03:21.420> but<00:03:21.840> actually<00:03:22.500> do<00:03:22.800> not<00:03:23.010> is<00:03:23.580> the<00:03:23.910> target

00:03:24.380 --> 00:03:24.390 
help but actually do not is the target

00:03:24.390 --> 00:03:27.140 
help but actually do not is the target
finder<00:03:24.660> and<00:03:25.080> the<00:03:25.290> IDI<00:03:25.680> tech<00:03:25.980> sight<00:03:26.280> and<00:03:26.550> the

00:03:27.140 --> 00:03:27.150 
finder and the IDI tech sight and the

00:03:27.150 --> 00:03:29.570 
finder and the IDI tech sight and the
reason<00:03:27.540> behind<00:03:27.690> this<00:03:28.230> is<00:03:28.500> because<00:03:28.800> the<00:03:29.310> target

00:03:29.570 --> 00:03:29.580 
reason behind this is because the target

00:03:29.580 --> 00:03:34.400 
reason behind this is because the target
finder<00:03:30.030> creates<00:03:30.960> a<00:03:31.230> red<00:03:32.030> box<00:03:33.030> around<00:03:33.410> your

00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:34.410 
finder creates a red box around your

00:03:34.410 --> 00:03:37.400 
finder creates a red box around your
enemy<00:03:34.890> and<00:03:35.100> that<00:03:35.370> sort<00:03:35.760> of<00:03:35.850> obstructs<00:03:36.660> where

00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:37.410 
enemy and that sort of obstructs where

00:03:37.410 --> 00:03:40.670 
enemy and that sort of obstructs where
you're<00:03:37.710> actually<00:03:38.060> aiming<00:03:39.060> for<00:03:39.380> so<00:03:40.380> even

00:03:40.670 --> 00:03:40.680 
you're actually aiming for so even

00:03:40.680 --> 00:03:42.890 
you're actually aiming for so even
though<00:03:40.800> you<00:03:40.860> can<00:03:41.340> aim<00:03:41.760> for<00:03:41.790> the<00:03:42.240> enemy's<00:03:42.600> head

00:03:42.890 --> 00:03:42.900 
though you can aim for the enemy's head

00:03:42.900 --> 00:03:45.350 
though you can aim for the enemy's head
while<00:03:43.620> using<00:03:43.950> the<00:03:44.190> target<00:03:44.520> finder<00:03:44.670> attachment

00:03:45.350 --> 00:03:45.360 
while using the target finder attachment

00:03:45.360 --> 00:03:47.780 
while using the target finder attachment
you<00:03:45.840> will<00:03:45.990> most<00:03:46.260> likely<00:03:46.470> not<00:03:46.920> be<00:03:46.980> accurate<00:03:47.640> in

00:03:47.780 --> 00:03:47.790 
you will most likely not be accurate in

00:03:47.790 --> 00:03:50.540 
you will most likely not be accurate in
doing<00:03:48.120> so<00:03:48.360> and<00:03:48.630> the<00:03:48.690> IDI<00:03:49.380> tech<00:03:49.740> sight<00:03:50.040> the<00:03:50.310> only

00:03:50.540 --> 00:03:50.550 
doing so and the IDI tech sight the only

00:03:50.550 --> 00:03:52.670 
doing so and the IDI tech sight the only
reason<00:03:50.910> I<00:03:51.120> do<00:03:51.720> not<00:03:51.840> recommend<00:03:52.170> this<00:03:52.500> is

00:03:52.670 --> 00:03:52.680 
reason I do not recommend this is

00:03:52.680 --> 00:03:55.640 
reason I do not recommend this is
because<00:03:53.040> the<00:03:53.580> reticle<00:03:54.060> is<00:03:54.300> just<00:03:54.660> so<00:03:55.170> large

00:03:55.640 --> 00:03:55.650 
because the reticle is just so large

00:03:55.650 --> 00:03:58.790 
because the reticle is just so large
that<00:03:56.100> it<00:03:56.580> obstructs<00:03:56.910> your<00:03:57.420> vision<00:03:57.900> and<00:03:58.080> there

00:03:58.790 --> 00:03:58.800 
that it obstructs your vision and there

00:03:58.800 --> 00:04:00.830 
that it obstructs your vision and there
really<00:03:59.070> aren't<00:03:59.430> any<00:03:59.610> other<00:04:00.000> radicals<00:04:00.600> that

00:04:00.830 --> 00:04:00.840 
really aren't any other radicals that

00:04:00.840 --> 00:04:05.050 
really aren't any other radicals that
you<00:04:00.960> can<00:04:01.140> unlock<00:04:01.730> that<00:04:02.730> will<00:04:03.200> be<00:04:04.200> any<00:04:04.380> better

00:04:05.050 --> 00:04:05.060 
you can unlock that will be any better

00:04:05.060 --> 00:04:09.350 
you can unlock that will be any better
so<00:04:06.110> moving<00:04:07.110> on<00:04:07.430> the<00:04:08.430> three<00:04:08.730> attachments<00:04:09.330> that

00:04:09.350 --> 00:04:09.360 
so moving on the three attachments that

00:04:09.360 --> 00:04:12.050 
so moving on the three attachments that
I<00:04:09.450> recommend<00:04:09.990> for<00:04:10.680> assault<00:04:11.160> rifles<00:04:11.550> is<00:04:11.700> once

00:04:12.050 --> 00:04:12.060 
I recommend for assault rifles is once

00:04:12.060 --> 00:04:15.740 
I recommend for assault rifles is once
again<00:04:12.180> the<00:04:12.330> reflex<00:04:12.900> sight<00:04:13.760> the<00:04:14.760> ACOG<00:04:15.420> sight

00:04:15.740 --> 00:04:15.750 
again the reflex sight the ACOG sight

00:04:15.750 --> 00:04:17.690 
again the reflex sight the ACOG sight
this<00:04:16.109> time<00:04:16.320> the<00:04:16.590> ACOG<00:04:16.920> sight<00:04:17.100> definitely

00:04:17.690 --> 00:04:17.700 
this time the ACOG sight definitely

00:04:17.700 --> 00:04:19.310 
this time the ACOG sight definitely
stick<00:04:17.940> with<00:04:18.090> the<00:04:18.180> default<00:04:18.660> because<00:04:18.900> if<00:04:19.170> you

00:04:19.310 --> 00:04:19.320 
stick with the default because if you

00:04:19.320 --> 00:04:21.349 
stick with the default because if you
move<00:04:19.530> out<00:04:19.739> of<00:04:19.799> the<00:04:20.160> default<00:04:20.609> once<00:04:20.850> again<00:04:21.180> it

00:04:21.349 --> 00:04:21.359 
move out of the default once again it

00:04:21.359 --> 00:04:23.620 
move out of the default once again it
will<00:04:21.450> obstruct<00:04:21.870> your<00:04:22.109> vision

00:04:23.620 --> 00:04:23.630 
will obstruct your vision

00:04:23.630 --> 00:04:25.760 
will obstruct your vision
lessen<00:04:24.630> your<00:04:24.750> chances<00:04:25.140> of<00:04:25.170> getting<00:04:25.500> the

00:04:25.760 --> 00:04:25.770 
lessen your chances of getting the

00:04:25.770 --> 00:04:27.140 
lessen your chances of getting the
actual<00:04:25.920> headshot<00:04:26.490> other<00:04:26.670> than<00:04:26.880> this

00:04:27.140 --> 00:04:27.150 
actual headshot other than this

00:04:27.150 --> 00:04:30.590 
actual headshot other than this
precision<00:04:28.880> reticle<00:04:29.880> right<00:04:30.030> here<00:04:30.240> this<00:04:30.420> is<00:04:30.480> the

00:04:30.590 --> 00:04:30.600 
precision reticle right here this is the

00:04:30.600 --> 00:04:34.430 
precision reticle right here this is the
only<00:04:30.900> other<00:04:31.230> one<00:04:31.620> for<00:04:31.980> the<00:04:32.130> ACOG<00:04:32.550> that<00:04:32.910> I<00:04:33.440> would

00:04:34.430 --> 00:04:34.440 
only other one for the ACOG that I would

00:04:34.440 --> 00:04:36.460 
only other one for the ACOG that I would
say<00:04:34.680> is<00:04:34.830> okay

00:04:36.460 --> 00:04:36.470 
say is okay

00:04:39.260 --> 00:04:39.270 
within the a clock there's the foregrip

00:04:39.270 --> 00:04:42.230

00:05:06.800 --> 00:05:06.810 
basically the key is to go for headshots

00:05:06.810 --> 00:05:11.030 
basically the key is to go for headshots
just<00:05:07.530> aim<00:05:07.740> for<00:05:07.770> the<00:05:08.130> head<00:05:08.310> um<00:05:08.640> and<00:05:10.040> another

just aim for the head um and another

00:05:11.040 --> 00:05:12.830 
just aim for the head um and another
thing<00:05:11.400> that<00:05:11.430> will<00:05:11.610> help<00:05:11.730> is<00:05:11.940> to<00:05:12.150> use<00:05:12.420> the<00:05:12.660> gun

00:05:12.830 --> 00:05:12.840 
thing that will help is to use the gun

00:05:12.840 --> 00:05:16.670 
thing that will help is to use the gun
constantly<00:05:13.560> until<00:05:14.180> you<00:05:15.180> get<00:05:16.140> the<00:05:16.230> headshots

00:05:16.670 --> 00:05:16.680 
constantly until you get the headshots

00:05:16.680 --> 00:05:18.740 
constantly until you get the headshots
for<00:05:16.980> it<00:05:17.100> because<00:05:17.400> if<00:05:17.580> you<00:05:17.730> switch<00:05:18.120> around<00:05:18.300> guns

00:05:18.740 --> 00:05:18.750 
for it because if you switch around guns

00:05:18.750 --> 00:05:21.380 
for it because if you switch around guns
all<00:05:19.140> the<00:05:19.170> time<00:05:19.320> then<00:05:20.190> it's<00:05:20.700> gonna<00:05:20.970> you<00:05:21.360> know

00:05:21.380 --> 00:05:21.390 
all the time then it's gonna you know

00:05:21.390 --> 00:05:24.920 
all the time then it's gonna you know
take<00:05:22.110> a<00:05:22.170> whole<00:05:22.530> lot<00:05:22.560> more<00:05:22.980> time<00:05:23.930> obviously

00:05:24.920 --> 00:05:24.930 
take a whole lot more time obviously

00:05:24.930 --> 00:05:27.050

because<00:05:25.200> if<00:05:25.290> you<00:05:25.380> use<00:05:25.560> the<00:05:25.590> same<00:05:26.010> gun<00:05:26.340> for<00:05:26.970> an

00:05:27.050 --> 00:05:27.060 
because if you use the same gun for an

00:05:27.060 --> 00:05:28.400 
because if you use the same gun for an
extended<00:05:27.510> period<00:05:27.630> of<00:05:27.840> time<00:05:27.900> they're<00:05:28.260> going<00:05:28.350> to

00:05:28.400 --> 00:05:28.410 
extended period of time they're going to

00:05:28.410 --> 00:05:30.830 
extended period of time they're going to
get<00:05:28.530> used<00:05:28.890> to<00:05:29.040> it<00:05:29.340> once<00:05:30.210> you<00:05:30.300> get<00:05:30.390> used<00:05:30.570> to<00:05:30.750> it
