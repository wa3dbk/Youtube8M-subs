of settle back in it was was pretty

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:32.990 
of settle back in it was was pretty
interesting<00:01:30.840> I've<00:01:31.079> actually<00:01:31.640> always<00:01:32.640> wanted

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:33.000 
interesting I've actually always wanted

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:35.600 
interesting I've actually always wanted
to<00:01:33.090> try<00:01:33.329> that<00:01:33.799> and<00:01:34.799> I<00:01:34.890> remember<00:01:35.159> thinking<00:01:35.340> but

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:35.610 
to try that and I remember thinking but

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:36.980 
to try that and I remember thinking but
when<00:01:35.729> I<00:01:35.820> was<00:01:35.909> going<00:01:36.060> down<00:01:36.270> the<00:01:36.390> runway<00:01:36.540> I<00:01:36.750> mean

00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:36.990 
when I was going down the runway I mean

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:39.080 
when I was going down the runway I mean
we<00:01:37.110> we<00:01:37.439> worked<00:01:37.920> this<00:01:38.100> thing<00:01:38.340> over<00:01:38.520> and<00:01:38.790> it<00:01:38.939> was

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:39.090 
we we worked this thing over and it was

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:41.179 
we we worked this thing over and it was
cold<00:01:39.540> and<00:01:39.840> I<00:01:39.960> had<00:01:40.110> to<00:01:40.229> wear<00:01:40.380> contact<00:01:41.100> we

00:01:41.179 --> 00:01:41.189 
cold and I had to wear contact we

00:01:41.189 --> 00:01:42.530 
cold and I had to wear contact we
figured<00:01:41.520> the<00:01:41.610> holding<00:01:41.850> camera<00:01:42.270> and<00:01:42.360> there<00:01:42.450> was

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:42.540 
figured the holding camera and there was

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:44.240 
figured the holding camera and there was
just<00:01:42.659> so<00:01:42.899> many<00:01:42.990> things<00:01:43.290> that<00:01:43.619> could

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:44.250 
just so many things that could

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:47.270 
just so many things that could
potentially<00:01:44.369> go<00:01:44.970> wrong<00:01:45.409> but<00:01:46.409> that<00:01:46.979> camera

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:47.280 
potentially go wrong but that camera

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:49.429 
potentially go wrong but that camera
angle<00:01:47.549> when<00:01:47.850> I<00:01:47.880> think<00:01:48.270> of<00:01:48.390> an<00:01:48.689> audience<00:01:49.170> and

00:01:49.429 --> 00:01:49.439 
angle when I think of an audience and

00:01:49.439 --> 00:01:51.410 
angle when I think of an audience and
