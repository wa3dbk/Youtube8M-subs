variations<00:01:15.960> my<00:01:16.560> only<00:01:16.830> gripe<00:01:16.979> about<00:01:17.159> this<00:01:17.490> case

00:01:17.749 --> 00:01:17.759 
variations my only gripe about this case

00:01:17.759 --> 00:01:19.370 
variations my only gripe about this case
is<00:01:17.939> that<00:01:18.060> when<00:01:18.180> you're<00:01:18.330> taking<00:01:18.689> it<00:01:18.750> in<00:01:18.960> and<00:01:19.259> out

00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:19.380 
is that when you're taking it in and out

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:19.880 
is that when you're taking it in and out
of<00:01:19.560> it

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:19.890 
of it

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:21.770 
of it
the<00:01:20.400> little<00:01:20.610> bezel<00:01:20.820> that<00:01:21.090> goes<00:01:21.270> around<00:01:21.450> the

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:21.780 
the little bezel that goes around the

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:24.380 
the little bezel that goes around the
camera<00:01:22.080> cutout<00:01:22.320> in<00:01:22.500> the<00:01:22.530> LED<00:01:22.979> flash<00:01:23.430> tends<00:01:24.210> to

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:24.390 
camera cutout in the LED flash tends to

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:26.480 
camera cutout in the LED flash tends to
pop<00:01:24.540> out<00:01:24.810> I'm<00:01:25.740> not<00:01:25.860> sure<00:01:26.009> why<00:01:26.189> it<00:01:26.250> does<00:01:26.460> that

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:26.490 
pop out I'm not sure why it does that

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:28.340 
pop out I'm not sure why it does that
but<00:01:26.820> it's<00:01:26.939> easy<00:01:27.180> enough<00:01:27.270> to<00:01:27.450> fix<00:01:27.750> just<00:01:27.869> line<00:01:28.200> it

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:28.350 
but it's easy enough to fix just line it

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:31.310 
but it's easy enough to fix just line it
back<00:01:28.470> up<00:01:28.530> and<00:01:28.950> snap<00:01:29.369> it<00:01:29.579> into<00:01:29.820> place<00:01:30.140> maybe<00:01:31.140> in

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:31.320 
back up and snap it into place maybe in

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:33.350 
back up and snap it into place maybe in
the<00:01:31.409> future<00:01:31.710> they'll<00:01:31.950> add<00:01:32.130> some<00:01:32.430> kind<00:01:32.640> of<00:01:32.729> fix

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:33.360 
the future they'll add some kind of fix

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:34.429
