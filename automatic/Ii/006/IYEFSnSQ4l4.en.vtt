sports<00:00:07.470> performance<00:00:07.980> giving<00:00:08.550> you<00:00:08.639> guys<00:00:08.790> the

00:00:08.810 --> 00:00:08.820 
sports performance giving you guys the

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:10.580 
sports performance giving you guys the
tip<00:00:09.150> of<00:00:09.269> the<00:00:09.330> month<00:00:09.510> this<00:00:10.080> month<00:00:10.139> we're<00:00:10.469> going

00:00:10.580 --> 00:00:10.590 
tip of the month this month we're going

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:11.959 
tip of the month this month we're going
to<00:00:10.650> talk<00:00:10.800> about<00:00:10.950> the<00:00:11.160> shoulder<00:00:11.519> now

00:00:11.959 --> 00:00:11.969 
to talk about the shoulder now

00:00:11.969 --> 00:00:13.610 
to talk about the shoulder now
oftentimes<00:00:12.360> a<00:00:12.690> gymnast<00:00:13.049> will<00:00:13.230> actually<00:00:13.500> see

00:00:13.610 --> 00:00:13.620 
oftentimes a gymnast will actually see

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:14.930 
oftentimes a gymnast will actually see
gymnast<00:00:13.950> with<00:00:14.070> an<00:00:14.219> adequate<00:00:14.639> amount<00:00:14.700> of

00:00:14.930 --> 00:00:14.940 
gymnast with an adequate amount of

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:17.240 
gymnast with an adequate amount of
shoulder<00:00:15.299> mobility<00:00:15.900> but<00:00:16.379> really<00:00:16.710> lacking<00:00:16.949> in

00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:17.250 
shoulder mobility but really lacking in

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:19.250 
shoulder mobility but really lacking in
shoulder<00:00:17.609> stability<00:00:17.850> and<00:00:18.449> the<00:00:18.869> reason<00:00:19.170> that's

00:00:19.250 --> 00:00:19.260 
shoulder stability and the reason that's

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:20.929 
shoulder stability and the reason that's
so<00:00:19.410> important<00:00:19.949> is<00:00:20.039> not<00:00:20.189> only<00:00:20.250> for<00:00:20.609> improved

00:00:20.929 --> 00:00:20.939 
so important is not only for improved

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:22.910 
so important is not only for improved
performance<00:00:21.090> but<00:00:22.020> also<00:00:22.050> for<00:00:22.590> injury

00:00:22.910 --> 00:00:22.920 
performance but also for injury

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:24.679 
performance but also for injury
prevention<00:00:23.070> so<00:00:23.939> it's<00:00:24.090> really<00:00:24.240> important<00:00:24.600> that

00:00:24.679 --> 00:00:24.689 
prevention so it's really important that

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:26.179 
prevention so it's really important that
we<00:00:24.779> actually<00:00:24.930> train<00:00:25.320> the<00:00:25.439> shoulder<00:00:25.800> not<00:00:25.980> only

00:00:26.179 --> 00:00:26.189 
we actually train the shoulder not only

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:28.099 
we actually train the shoulder not only
to<00:00:26.369> move<00:00:26.609> well<00:00:26.880> but<00:00:27.390> actually<00:00:27.480> to<00:00:27.779> be<00:00:27.869> able<00:00:27.930> to

00:00:28.099 --> 00:00:28.109 
to move well but actually to be able to

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:29.689 
to move well but actually to be able to
stabilize<00:00:28.380> throughout<00:00:29.099> that<00:00:29.279> whole<00:00:29.460> entire

00:00:29.689 --> 00:00:29.699 
stabilize throughout that whole entire

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:31.220 
stabilize throughout that whole entire
range<00:00:29.970> of<00:00:30.029> motion<00:00:30.119> so<00:00:30.840> we're<00:00:30.960> going<00:00:31.080> to<00:00:31.140> give

00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:31.230 
range of motion so we're going to give

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:33.290 
range of motion so we're going to give
you<00:00:31.260> guys<00:00:31.470> a<00:00:31.529> few<00:00:31.830> exercises<00:00:32.550> a<00:00:32.610> bit<00:00:32.759> today

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:33.300 
you guys a few exercises a bit today

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:35.870 
you guys a few exercises a bit today
that<00:00:33.840> you<00:00:33.899> can<00:00:34.020> do<00:00:34.140> on<00:00:34.260> your<00:00:34.380> own<00:00:34.550> both<00:00:35.550> at<00:00:35.700> home

00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:35.880 
that you can do on your own both at home

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:39.680 
that you can do on your own both at home
and<00:00:35.940> in<00:00:36.570> the<00:00:36.690> gym<00:00:38.210> now<00:00:39.210> as<00:00:39.300> we<00:00:39.390> talk<00:00:39.570> about

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:39.690 
and in the gym now as we talk about

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:41.540 
and in the gym now as we talk about
shoulder<00:00:40.140> stability<00:00:40.379> one<00:00:41.219> of<00:00:41.309> the<00:00:41.370> most

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:41.550 
shoulder stability one of the most

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:43.069 
shoulder stability one of the most
important<00:00:42.000> things<00:00:42.120> that<00:00:42.270> we<00:00:42.390> can<00:00:42.540> actually<00:00:42.690> do

00:00:43.069 --> 00:00:43.079 
important things that we can actually do

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:45.139 
important things that we can actually do
is<00:00:43.230> be<00:00:43.710> able<00:00:43.800> to<00:00:43.920> stabilize<00:00:44.190> ourselves<00:00:44.940> in<00:00:45.059> a

00:00:45.139 --> 00:00:45.149 
is be able to stabilize ourselves in a

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:47.420 
is be able to stabilize ourselves in a
basic<00:00:45.600> push-up<00:00:46.050> position<00:00:46.200> so<00:00:47.070> it's<00:00:47.190> a<00:00:47.250> very

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:47.430 
basic push-up position so it's a very

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:49.490 
basic push-up position so it's a very
underrated<00:00:47.879> exercise<00:00:48.480> we<00:00:48.930> have<00:00:49.110> to<00:00:49.200> do<00:00:49.289> it<00:00:49.410> the

00:00:49.490 --> 00:00:49.500 
underrated exercise we have to do it the

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:51.110 
underrated exercise we have to do it the
right<00:00:49.649> way<00:00:49.710> and<00:00:50.340> we<00:00:50.399> can<00:00:50.550> actually<00:00:50.850> train

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:51.120 
right way and we can actually train

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:53.270 
right way and we can actually train
through<00:00:51.329> a<00:00:51.390> couple<00:00:51.690> variations<00:00:51.960> to<00:00:52.829> force<00:00:53.100> our

00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:53.280 
through a couple variations to force our

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:54.889 
through a couple variations to force our
shoulder<00:00:53.730> and<00:00:53.760> our<00:00:53.910> whole<00:00:54.090> entire<00:00:54.180> upper<00:00:54.690> body

00:00:54.889 --> 00:00:54.899 
shoulder and our whole entire upper body

00:00:54.899 --> 00:00:57.049 
shoulder and our whole entire upper body
to<00:00:55.469> remain<00:00:55.680> in<00:00:55.829> a<00:00:55.920> stabilized<00:00:56.399> position<00:00:56.610> so

00:00:57.049 --> 00:00:57.059 
to remain in a stabilized position so

00:00:57.059 --> 00:00:58.279 
to remain in a stabilized position so
this<00:00:57.180> is<00:00:57.239> gonna<00:00:57.329> involve<00:00:57.570> a<00:00:57.750> lot<00:00:57.899> of<00:00:58.020> core<00:00:58.260> work

00:00:58.279 --> 00:00:58.289 
this is gonna involve a lot of core work

00:00:58.289 --> 00:01:00.410 
this is gonna involve a lot of core work
making<00:00:59.129> sure<00:00:59.250> that<00:00:59.340> our<00:00:59.489> core<00:00:59.730> doesn't<00:01:00.270> rotate

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:00.420 
making sure that our core doesn't rotate

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:01.760 
making sure that our core doesn't rotate
so<00:01:01.079> what<00:01:01.199> we're<00:01:01.289> going<00:01:01.379> to<00:01:01.440> do<00:01:01.530> is<00:01:01.590> we're<00:01:01.680> going

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:01.770 
so what we're going to do is we're going

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:03.889 
so what we're going to do is we're going
to<00:01:01.829> start<00:01:02.039> in<00:01:02.160> a<00:01:02.219> push-up<00:01:02.460> position<00:01:02.899> okay

00:01:03.889 --> 00:01:03.899 
to start in a push-up position okay

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:05.450 
to start in a push-up position okay
we're<00:01:04.439> going<00:01:04.530> to<00:01:04.619> make<00:01:04.739> sure<00:01:04.890> our<00:01:04.920> glutes<00:01:05.309> are

00:01:05.450 --> 00:01:05.460 
we're going to make sure our glutes are

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:06.920 
we're going to make sure our glutes are
squeezed<00:01:05.729> and<00:01:05.880> tight<00:01:06.150> so<00:01:06.420> that<00:01:06.450> we're<00:01:06.750> in<00:01:06.869> a

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:06.930 
squeezed and tight so that we're in a

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:08.899 
squeezed and tight so that we're in a
perfect<00:01:07.110> position<00:01:07.470> and<00:01:08.340> once<00:01:08.520> we<00:01:08.610> get<00:01:08.700> in<00:01:08.820> that

00:01:08.899 --> 00:01:08.909 
perfect position and once we get in that

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:09.800 
perfect position and once we get in that
position<00:01:09.060> we're<00:01:09.330> going<00:01:09.390> to<00:01:09.510> slightly

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:09.810 
position we're going to slightly

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:11.480 
position we're going to slightly
separate<00:01:10.380> our<00:01:10.530> feet<00:01:10.710> out<00:01:10.890> for<00:01:11.130> our<00:01:11.220> first

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:11.490 
separate our feet out for our first

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:13.310 
separate our feet out for our first
variation<00:01:11.840> once<00:01:12.840> we're<00:01:12.990> in<00:01:13.080> this<00:01:13.140> position

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:13.320 
variation once we're in this position

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:15.260 
variation once we're in this position
we're<00:01:13.740> simply<00:01:14.100> going<00:01:14.250> to<00:01:14.340> raise<00:01:14.520> one<00:01:15.030> hand

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:15.270 
we're simply going to raise one hand

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:17.120 
we're simply going to raise one hand
forward<00:01:15.630> at<00:01:15.750> a<00:01:15.810> time<00:01:16.020> so<00:01:16.650> this<00:01:16.799> time<00:01:17.009> we'll

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:17.130 
forward at a time so this time we'll

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:23.800 
forward at a time so this time we'll
raise<00:01:17.280> the<00:01:17.460> left<00:01:17.640> hand<00:01:17.880> forward

00:01:23.800 --> 00:01:23.810 

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:26.710 

and<00:01:24.260> then<00:01:24.799> just<00:01:25.010> alternate<00:01:25.400> side<00:01:25.670> to<00:01:25.790> side<00:01:26.000> now

00:01:26.710 --> 00:01:26.720 
and then just alternate side to side now

00:01:26.720 --> 00:01:28.000 
and then just alternate side to side now
as<00:01:26.869> we<00:01:26.960> raised<00:01:27.170> those<00:01:27.380> opposite<00:01:27.799> hands

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:28.010 
as we raised those opposite hands

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:29.109 
as we raised those opposite hands
forward<00:01:28.369> you're<00:01:28.460> going<00:01:28.580> to<00:01:28.640> notice<00:01:28.850> that<00:01:28.880> the

00:01:29.109 --> 00:01:29.119 
forward you're going to notice that the

00:01:29.119 --> 00:01:31.240 
forward you're going to notice that the
opposite<00:01:29.540> arm<00:01:29.720> has<00:01:30.260> to<00:01:30.380> do<00:01:30.470> a<00:01:30.500> really<00:01:30.860> good<00:01:31.040> job

00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:31.250 
opposite arm has to do a really good job

00:01:31.250 --> 00:01:33.460 
opposite arm has to do a really good job
forcing<00:01:32.150> itself<00:01:32.450> into<00:01:32.780> a<00:01:32.810> higher<00:01:33.080> degree<00:01:33.350> of

00:01:33.460 --> 00:01:33.470 
forcing itself into a higher degree of

00:01:33.470 --> 00:01:35.499 
forcing itself into a higher degree of
stability<00:01:33.770> and<00:01:34.250> the<00:01:34.640> core<00:01:34.850> has<00:01:35.060> to<00:01:35.090> do<00:01:35.299> a<00:01:35.330> lot

00:01:35.499 --> 00:01:35.509 
stability and the core has to do a lot

couple basic exercises that you can use
to<00:03:02.209> work<00:03:02.329> on<00:03:02.510> shoulder<00:03:03.440> stability<00:03:03.620> but<00:03:04.430> also

00:03:04.599 --> 00:03:04.609 
to work on shoulder stability but also

00:03:04.609 --> 00:03:06.250
