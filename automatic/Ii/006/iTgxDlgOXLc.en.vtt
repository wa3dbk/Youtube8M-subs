00:01:03.029 --> 00:01:03.039 
I would cut the edge about an inch and

00:01:03.039 --> 00:01:06.180 
I would cut the edge about an inch and
9/16<00:01:03.969> a<00:01:04.059> little<00:01:04.269> bit<00:01:04.420> bigger<00:01:04.660> and<00:01:05.050> you<00:01:05.920> turn

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:06.190 
9/16 a little bit bigger and you turn

00:01:06.190 --> 00:01:08.190 
9/16 a little bit bigger and you turn

there and then remember this is the

00:01:15.250 --> 00:01:16.950 
there and then remember this is the
thickness<00:01:15.490> control<00:01:16.119> you'll<00:01:16.299> have<00:01:16.450> to<00:01:16.600> just<00:01:16.840> do

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:16.960 
thickness control you'll have to just do

00:01:16.960 --> 00:01:19.530 
thickness control you'll have to just do
a<00:01:16.990> couple<00:01:17.380> practice<00:01:17.590> runs<00:01:18.250> on<00:01:18.520> a<00:01:18.549> scrap<00:01:19.299> piece

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:19.540 
a couple practice runs on a scrap piece

a couple practice runs on a scrap piece
of<00:01:19.750> laminate<00:01:20.200> to<00:01:20.799> get<00:01:21.009> your<00:01:21.270> cutter<00:01:22.270> blades

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:26.140 
the right depth and this is the way I

00:01:26.140 --> 00:01:30.870 
the right depth and this is the way I
would<00:01:26.409> do<00:01:26.530> this<00:01:26.850> take<00:01:27.850> the<00:01:28.000> laminate<00:01:29.610> slide<00:01:30.610> it

00:01:30.870 --> 00:01:30.880 
would do this take the laminate slide it

00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:33.090 
would do this take the laminate slide it
see<00:01:31.509> if<00:01:31.600> you<00:01:31.689> can<00:01:31.840> see<00:01:32.049> the<00:01:32.200> slide<00:01:32.470> it<00:01:32.619> inside

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:33.100 
see if you can see the slide it inside

00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:36.120 
see if you can see the slide it inside
of<00:01:33.430> the<00:01:34.149> slitter<00:01:34.530> you<00:01:35.530> can<00:01:35.680> see<00:01:35.829> where<00:01:36.040> it
