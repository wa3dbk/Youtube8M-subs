building that I showed you I can't then
I<00:00:46.649> name<00:00:47.039> of<00:00:47.160> it<00:00:47.280> from<00:00:47.460> right<00:00:47.760> here<00:00:47.789> I<00:00:48.090> think

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:48.120 
I name of it from right here I think

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:50.750 
I name of it from right here I think
it's<00:00:48.420> I<00:00:48.660> double<00:00:49.260> ice<00:00:49.379> like<00:00:49.649> that<00:00:49.860> and<00:00:50.190> so<00:00:50.700> I'm

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:50.760 
it's I double ice like that and so I'm

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:52.160 
it's I double ice like that and so I'm
going<00:00:50.910> to<00:00:50.969> fly<00:00:51.120> there<00:00:51.360> now<00:00:51.539> and<00:00:51.690> annihilate<00:00:52.140> I

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:52.170 
going to fly there now and annihilate I

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:53.779 
going to fly there now and annihilate I
