00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.300
 good to all welcome to a new 

00:00:02.040 --> 00:00:05.759
 video the truth that the news we 

00:00:03.300 --> 00:00:07.350
 caught by surprise this morning and good 

00:00:05.759 --> 00:00:09.420
 is that a published patent 

00:00:07.350 --> 00:00:10.889
 recently he has revealed that he is 

00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:13.799
 be working on some new cameras 

00:00:10.889 --> 00:00:14.969
 between it the patents of reference to 

00:00:13.799 --> 00:00:17.400
 an interactive game environment 

00:00:14.969 --> 00:00:19.949
 three-dimensional controlled by the user 

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:22.619
 or it is basically what makes it 

00:00:19.949 --> 00:00:25.019
 which it makes me ballet but good 

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:27.150
 voice control and such but good is 

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:29.820
 basically what he does has 

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:32.400
 and I think good for a good 

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:34.890
 strategy on the part of sony but for 

00:00:32.400 --> 00:00:39.030
 I do not like the truth because of me 

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:41.970
 I like this kind of stuff, I'm not 

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:44.340
 traditional memo player with the command and 

00:00:41.970 --> 00:00:45.540
 is what you have I do not know what you are going to see is 

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:47.760
 what you will see always as soon as 

00:00:45.540 --> 00:00:51.989
 leave 2 arming I will leave the console what 

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:54.089
 safer because the truth is that I do not 

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:57.269
 I see I do not know is that I remember the e3 of 

00:00:54.089 --> 00:00:59.159
 last year and I do not know I expect something like that for 

00:00:57.269 --> 00:01:02.360
 within two or three years he joins us three 

00:00:59.159 --> 00:01:05.840
 play full of little cameras 

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:07.240
 I do not know games for young children very 

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:09.280
 little ones 

00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:11.909
 because really truly the 

00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:15.549
 public that has this type of games 

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:18.580
 for the ps3 camera or the world such is 

00:01:15.549 --> 00:01:21.820
 Well, it's a public, well, well, 

00:01:18.580 --> 00:01:25.840
 small is what is there is what is 

00:01:21.820 --> 00:01:30.159
 there is if I used the move 23 fish but 

00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:35.200
 is already appears to me is to prove 

00:01:30.159 --> 00:01:37.149
 no longer does not have no more 

00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:38.830
 has no more does not have more is not supposed 

00:01:37.149 --> 00:01:41.409
 it's the same and the kinect or good I've 

00:01:38.830 --> 00:01:43.450
 tried but good will be more of the same 

00:01:41.409 --> 00:01:45.880
 no more of the same 

00:01:43.450 --> 00:01:47.920
 games that are not hardcore at all 

00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:51.270
 for us for those of us who play 

00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:54.359
 daily to varied games 

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:56.159
 tough guys so to speak that 

00:01:54.359 --> 00:01:59.140
 has a complicated mechanics and a 

00:01:56.159 --> 00:02:02.020
 acceptable depth 

00:01:59.140 --> 00:02:04.240
 the world of now I want to say and good 

00:02:02.020 --> 00:02:06.070
 nothing else we will see to see if this camera is 

00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:08.940
 for this generation or for the next 

00:02:06.070 --> 00:02:10.630
 I do not know what will happen 

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:12.850
 the truth 

00:02:10.630 --> 00:02:14.350
 I guess it will be for the next not 

00:02:12.850 --> 00:02:16.690
 I think for this generation they dare 

00:02:14.350 --> 00:02:20.290
 to get a new camera I see something 

00:02:16.690 --> 00:02:22.450
 stupid and illogical the truth a shit 

00:02:20.290 --> 00:02:24.860
 in every rule and as the present in the 

00:02:22.450 --> 00:02:27.860
 e3 the like all 

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:29.270
 do not fuck me and well nothing else this has 

00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:31.880
 been everything I hope you liked it and 

00:02:29.270 --> 00:02:34.210
 we go in the next video until the 

00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:34.210
 next
