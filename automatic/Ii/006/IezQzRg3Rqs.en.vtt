 I want to talk about this video 

00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:09.420
 fear of people and what you can do for 

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:11.940
 so that it does not prevent you from acting 

00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:14.099
 all situations when you feel it 

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:16.289
 when you have someone that does not give you to do 

00:00:14.099 --> 00:00:17.880
 what you want but two before that 

00:00:16.289 --> 00:00:20.220
 words to me who am I such why at all 

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:20.730
 I raise this topic a few years ago 

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:22.760
 backwards 

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:27.180
 the question was still very relevant to me 

00:00:22.760 --> 00:00:30.179
 how to get rid of fear people like me 

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:32.090
 stop being afraid of social situations 

00:00:30.179 --> 00:00:35.969
 different to experience stress 

00:00:32.090 --> 00:00:39.030
 various disturbing thought in the head here 

00:00:35.969 --> 00:00:42.930
 for several years now i'm free from these 

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:44.489
 fears and doing what I want 

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:46.500

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:52.410

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:55.050
 I was here so I experienced one 

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:57.239
 exercise which is pretty good 

00:00:55.050 --> 00:01:00.690
 it helps them to muffle this fear and 

00:00:57.239 --> 00:01:02.579
 do something that is not afraid here and so 

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:04.049

 better understand this exercise means what 

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:22.140
 generally speaking the problem is the fear of people in 

00:01:18.689 --> 00:01:24.180
 that sometime in the past one or 

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:26.100
 several times you have been strong 

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:28.799

 traumatic situations but who 

00:01:28.799 --> 00:01:33.299
 made you start to fear 

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:34.890
 interaction with people most likely is 

00:01:33.299 --> 00:01:38.180

00:01:59.730 --> 00:02:03.690
