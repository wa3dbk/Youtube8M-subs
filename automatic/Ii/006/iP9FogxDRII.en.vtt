that because the Indians were so small

00:02:02.220 --> 00:02:05.900 
that because the Indians were so small
and<00:02:02.610> quick<00:02:03.679> that<00:02:04.679> Warner<00:02:05.220> needed<00:02:05.580> to<00:02:05.759> do

00:02:05.900 --> 00:02:05.910 
and quick that Warner needed to do

00:02:05.910 --> 00:02:08.270 
and quick that Warner needed to do
something<00:02:06.360> to<00:02:06.509> give<00:02:06.660> them<00:02:06.869> an<00:02:07.020> edge<00:02:07.229> it<00:02:07.950> was<00:02:08.099> so
