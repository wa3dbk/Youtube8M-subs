00:00:04.910 --> 00:00:14.150 
GCSE biology 263
this<00:00:05.910> is<00:00:06.319> section<00:00:07.400> C<00:00:10.370> and<00:00:12.830> here<00:00:13.830> we're<00:00:14.009> looking

00:00:14.150 --> 00:00:14.160 
this is section C and here we're looking

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:20.500 
this is section C and here we're looking
at<00:00:15.150> the<00:00:16.250> blood<00:00:17.250> supply<00:00:17.460> to<00:00:17.970> the<00:00:18.180> heart<00:00:19.160> via<00:00:20.160> the

00:00:20.500 --> 00:00:20.510 
at the blood supply to the heart via the

00:00:20.510 --> 00:00:28.160 
at the blood supply to the heart via the
coronary<00:00:24.320> artery<00:00:25.789> this<00:00:26.789> is<00:00:26.970> the<00:00:27.240> blood<00:00:27.689> vessel

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:28.170 
coronary artery this is the blood vessel

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:35.360 
coronary artery this is the blood vessel
which<00:00:28.680> supplies<00:00:29.269> heart<00:00:31.130> muscle<00:00:33.860> the<00:00:34.860> coronary

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:35.370 
which supplies heart muscle the coronary

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:40.340 
which supplies heart muscle the coronary
artery<00:00:35.790> is<00:00:35.969> a<00:00:36.000> branch<00:00:36.420> of<00:00:36.600> the<00:00:36.809> aorta<00:00:39.200> so<00:00:40.200> the

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:40.350 
artery is a branch of the aorta so the

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:44.770 
artery is a branch of the aorta so the
AR<00:00:40.770> 2<00:00:40.950> leaves<00:00:41.250> the<00:00:41.460> heart<00:00:41.700> and<00:00:43.100> branches<00:00:44.100> to

00:00:44.770 --> 00:00:44.780 
AR 2 leaves the heart and branches to

00:00:44.780 --> 00:00:47.690 
AR 2 leaves the heart and branches to
form<00:00:45.780> the<00:00:45.899> coronary<00:00:46.500> artery<00:00:46.920> and<00:00:47.190> the

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:47.700 
form the coronary artery and the

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:50.139 
form the coronary artery and the
coronary<00:00:48.180> artery<00:00:48.600> takes<00:00:48.930> oxygen<00:00:49.260> and

00:00:50.139 --> 00:00:50.149 
coronary artery takes oxygen and

00:00:50.149 --> 00:00:54.139 
coronary artery takes oxygen and
nutrient<00:00:51.649> such<00:00:52.649> as<00:00:52.829> glucose<00:00:53.309> to<00:00:53.820> the<00:00:53.910> heart

artery in cross-section look like this

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:54.230 
artery in cross-section look like this
and<00:01:51.530> the<00:01:52.530> wall<00:01:52.710> would<00:01:52.890> be<00:01:53.010> like<00:01:53.220> this<00:01:53.490> down

00:01:54.230 --> 00:01:54.240 
and the wall would be like this down

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:56.390 
and the wall would be like this down
through<00:01:54.480> the<00:01:54.600> center<00:01:54.990> here<00:01:55.350> travels<00:01:56.220> the

through the center here travels the

00:01:56.400 --> 00:02:01.400 
through the center here travels the
blood<00:01:57.230> now<00:01:58.230> if<00:01:58.410> this<00:01:59.660> central<00:02:00.660> part<00:02:00.960> called

00:02:01.400 --> 00:02:01.410 
blood now if this central part called

blood now if this central part called
the<00:02:01.500> lumen<00:02:02.869> through<00:02:03.869> which<00:02:04.020> the<00:02:04.200> blood

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:04.290 
the lumen through which the blood

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:08.090 
the lumen through which the blood
travels<00:02:04.800> if<00:02:05.010> this<00:02:05.670> becomes<00:02:06.000> blocked<00:02:06.800> then<00:02:07.800> the

00:02:08.090 --> 00:02:08.100 
travels if this becomes blocked then the

00:02:08.100 --> 00:02:10.280 
travels if this becomes blocked then the
heart<00:02:08.340> would<00:02:08.550> receive<00:02:09.030> less<00:02:09.660> blood<00:02:10.050> and

00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:10.290 
heart would receive less blood and

00:02:10.290 --> 00:02:13.580 
heart would receive less blood and
therefore<00:02:10.770> less<00:02:11.490> oxygen<00:02:11.730> and<00:02:12.209> nutrient<00:02:13.110> this

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:13.590 
therefore less oxygen and nutrient this

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:20.830 
therefore less oxygen and nutrient this
blockage<00:02:14.250> process<00:02:15.890> could<00:02:16.890> perhaps<00:02:17.100> be<00:02:17.670> a

00:02:20.830 --> 00:02:20.840 

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:24.290 

partial<00:02:21.840> blockage<00:02:21.990> like<00:02:22.530> this<00:02:22.880> here<00:02:23.880> we<00:02:24.000> see<00:02:24.270> a

00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:24.300 
partial blockage like this here we see a

00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:28.730 
partial blockage like this here we see a
buildup<00:02:24.870> of<00:02:25.050> the<00:02:25.170> blockage<00:02:25.530> down<00:02:25.770> here<00:02:27.590> so<00:02:28.590> we

00:02:28.730 --> 00:02:28.740 
buildup of the blockage down here so we

00:02:28.740 --> 00:02:34.110 
buildup of the blockage down here so we
have<00:02:28.890> reduced<00:02:29.430> blood<00:02:29.670> flow

00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:34.120

00:02:36.970 --> 00:02:36.980 
which of course in turn means reduced

00:02:36.980 --> 00:02:42.250 
which of course in turn means reduced
oxygen<00:02:37.880> supply<00:02:38.360> and<00:02:38.690> reduced<00:02:39.650> nutrient<00:02:41.260> such

00:02:42.250 --> 00:02:42.260 
oxygen supply and reduced nutrient such

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:45.910 
oxygen supply and reduced nutrient such
as<00:02:42.470> glucose<00:02:42.980> and<00:02:43.870> a<00:02:44.870> patient<00:02:45.200> suffering<00:02:45.890> from

this would experience a condition called

00:02:48.320 --> 00:02:54.490 
this would experience a condition called

00:03:42.920 --> 00:03:48.729 
if the coronary artery is blocked in
this<00:03:43.760> area<00:03:44.209> here<00:03:46.000> then<00:03:47.000> all<00:03:47.750> the<00:03:48.110> heart<00:03:48.380> cells

00:03:48.729 --> 00:03:48.739 
this area here then all the heart cells

00:03:48.739 --> 00:03:52.150 
this area here then all the heart cells
in<00:03:49.670> this<00:03:50.030> area<00:03:50.570> here<00:03:51.080> supplied<00:03:51.830> by<00:03:52.100> the

00:03:52.150 --> 00:03:52.160 
in this area here supplied by the

00:03:52.160 --> 00:03:54.970 
in this area here supplied by the
current<00:03:52.900> coronary<00:03:53.900> artery<00:03:54.350> will<00:03:54.560> deplete

00:03:54.970 --> 00:03:54.980 
current coronary artery will deplete

00:03:54.980 --> 00:04:01.000 
current coronary artery will deplete
deprived<00:03:55.580> of<00:03:55.880> oxygen<00:03:56.150> and<00:03:57.340> nutrient<00:03:59.620> if<00:04:00.620> this

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:01.010 
deprived of oxygen and nutrient if this

00:04:01.010 --> 00:04:04.840 
deprived of oxygen and nutrient if this
is<00:04:01.280> severe<00:04:02.060> blockage<00:04:02.470> then<00:04:03.470> these<00:04:03.890> cells<00:04:04.280> will

00:04:04.840 --> 00:04:04.850 
is severe blockage then these cells will

00:04:04.850 --> 00:04:09.850 
is severe blockage then these cells will
begin<00:04:05.000> to<00:04:05.180> die<00:04:07.360> so<00:04:08.360> all<00:04:08.630> these<00:04:08.959> cells<00:04:09.350> in<00:04:09.680> the

00:04:09.850 --> 00:04:09.860 
begin to die so all these cells in the

00:04:09.860 --> 00:04:14.050 
begin to die so all these cells in the
region<00:04:10.160> of<00:04:10.220> the<00:04:10.310> heart<00:04:10.550> would<00:04:11.360> die<00:04:11.660> and<00:04:13.060> this

00:04:14.050 --> 00:04:14.060 
region of the heart would die and this

00:04:14.060 --> 00:04:17.590 
region of the heart would die and this
is<00:04:14.300> what<00:04:14.690> is<00:04:14.930> better<00:04:15.320> known<00:04:15.680> as<00:04:15.950> a<00:04:16.880> heart

00:04:17.590 --> 00:04:17.600 
is what is better known as a heart

00:04:17.600 --> 00:04:18.220 
is what is better known as a heart
attack

00:04:18.220 --> 00:04:18.230 
attack

00:04:18.230 --> 00:04:21.370 
attack
so<00:04:18.410> myocardial<00:04:19.070> infarction<00:04:20.000> is<00:04:20.450> what<00:04:20.870> we<00:04:21.049> call

00:04:21.370 --> 00:04:21.380 
so myocardial infarction is what we call

00:04:21.380 --> 00:04:25.690 
so myocardial infarction is what we call
a<00:04:21.620> heart<00:04:22.460> attack<00:04:23.620> when<00:04:24.620> severe<00:04:25.100> this<00:04:25.460> can

00:04:25.690 --> 00:04:25.700 
a heart attack when severe this can

00:04:25.700 --> 00:04:29.170 
a heart attack when severe this can
actually<00:04:26.060> lead<00:04:26.270> to<00:04:26.300> death<00:04:27.400> it<00:04:28.400> is<00:04:28.520> possible

00:04:29.170 --> 00:04:29.180 
actually lead to death it is possible

00:04:29.180 --> 00:04:33.120 
actually lead to death it is possible
for<00:04:30.040> surgeons<00:04:31.040> to<00:04:31.430> bypass<00:04:31.910> these<00:04:32.419> blockages

00:04:33.120 --> 00:04:33.130 
for surgeons to bypass these blockages

00:04:33.130 --> 00:04:36.610 
for surgeons to bypass these blockages
this<00:04:34.130> is<00:04:34.600> what<00:04:35.600> students<00:04:36.080> will<00:04:36.290> be<00:04:36.410> familiar

00:04:36.610 --> 00:04:36.620 
this is what students will be familiar

00:04:36.620 --> 00:04:42.080 
this is what students will be familiar
with<00:04:37.660> the<00:04:38.660> phrase<00:04:39.490> coronary

00:04:42.080 --> 00:04:42.090 
with the phrase coronary

00:04:42.090 --> 00:04:48.210 
with the phrase coronary
bypass<00:04:43.620> in<00:04:44.620> which<00:04:44.860> the<00:04:45.130> surgeon<00:04:47.040> is<00:04:48.040> the

00:04:48.210 --> 00:04:48.220 
bypass in which the surgeon is the

00:04:48.220 --> 00:04:50.700 
bypass in which the surgeon is the
blockages<00:04:48.760> here<00:04:49.210> it's<00:04:49.960> possible<00:04:50.470> for<00:04:50.590> the
