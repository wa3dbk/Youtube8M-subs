the<00:00:03.030> Beatles<00:00:03.360> a<00:00:03.720> fool<00:00:04.259> on<00:00:04.410> the<00:00:04.440> hill<00:00:04.560> a<00:00:04.950> way<00:00:05.490> of

00:00:05.599 --> 00:00:05.609 
the Beatles a fool on the hill a way of

00:00:05.609 --> 00:00:07.789 
the Beatles a fool on the hill a way of
playing<00:00:05.790> it<00:00:05.940> on<00:00:06.120> acoustic<00:00:06.960> guitar<00:00:07.259> course

00:00:07.789 --> 00:00:07.799 
playing it on acoustic guitar course

00:00:07.799 --> 00:00:09.530 
playing it on acoustic guitar course
ordinarily<00:00:08.220> it's<00:00:08.460> a<00:00:08.550> piano<00:00:08.849> tune<00:00:09.090> but<00:00:09.300> um

00:00:09.530 --> 00:00:09.540 
ordinarily it's a piano tune but um

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:11.209 
ordinarily it's a piano tune but um
can't<00:00:10.320> do<00:00:10.380> a<00:00:10.410> pretty<00:00:10.590> nice<00:00:10.769> version<00:00:11.010> on<00:00:11.160> the

00:00:11.209 --> 00:00:11.219 
can't do a pretty nice version on the

00:00:11.219 --> 00:00:14.330 
can't do a pretty nice version on the
guitar<00:00:11.519> too<00:00:11.759> and<00:00:12.620> does<00:00:13.620> use<00:00:13.769> some<00:00:13.799> nice<00:00:14.040> chords

00:00:14.330 --> 00:00:14.340 
guitar too and does use some nice chords

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:18.769 
guitar too and does use some nice chords
interesting<00:00:15.120> once<00:00:15.269> two<00:00:15.420> months<00:00:16.970> okay<00:00:18.000> starts

00:00:18.769 --> 00:00:18.779 
interesting once two months okay starts

00:00:18.779 --> 00:00:21.980 
interesting once two months okay starts
on<00:00:18.990> a<00:00:19.260> d6<00:00:20.189> which<00:00:21.090> if<00:00:21.539> you<00:00:21.689> take<00:00:21.720> your

00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:21.990 
on a d6 which if you take your

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:24.109 
on a d6 which if you take your
deformation<00:00:22.800> just<00:00:23.340> to<00:00:23.400> release<00:00:23.640> the<00:00:23.670> second

00:00:24.109 --> 00:00:24.119 
deformation just to release the second

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:25.460 
deformation just to release the second
string<00:00:24.359> so<00:00:24.689> you're<00:00:24.810> basically<00:00:25.019> just<00:00:25.140> playing

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:25.470 
string so you're basically just playing

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:27.290 
string so you're basically just playing
the<00:00:25.650> first<00:00:25.920> string<00:00:26.189> on<00:00:26.310> the<00:00:26.400> 2nd<00:00:26.760> and<00:00:27.180> the<00:00:27.210> 3rd

00:00:27.290 --> 00:00:27.300 
the first string on the 2nd and the 3rd

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:39.750 
the first string on the 2nd and the 3rd
string<00:00:27.779> on<00:00:27.930> the<00:00:27.990> 2nd<00:00:28.410> okay<00:00:28.920> so

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:39.760 

00:00:39.760 --> 00:00:43.930 

the<00:00:40.180> next<00:00:40.420> chord

00:00:43.930 --> 00:00:43.940 

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:48.910 

I<00:00:44.109> think<00:00:45.109> it's<00:00:45.670> a<00:00:46.670> miner<00:00:47.179> over<00:00:47.449> D<00:00:47.659> so<00:00:47.989> like<00:00:48.769> I'd

00:00:48.910 --> 00:00:48.920 
I think it's a miner over D so like I'd

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:51.849 
I think it's a miner over D so like I'd
like<00:00:49.219> your<00:00:49.370> D<00:00:49.550> miners<00:00:49.940> here<00:00:50.210> right<00:00:50.649> right<00:00:51.649> to

00:00:51.849 --> 00:00:51.859 
like your D miners here right right to

00:00:51.859 --> 00:00:53.529 
like your D miners here right right to
that<00:00:52.190> formation<00:00:52.699> just<00:00:52.820> slide<00:00:53.149> it<00:00:53.269> up<00:00:53.359> two

00:00:53.529 --> 00:00:53.539 
that formation just slide it up two

00:00:53.539 --> 00:00:56.529 
that formation just slide it up two
frets<00:00:53.570> to<00:00:53.960> make<00:00:54.339> any<00:00:55.339> minor<00:00:55.519> obviously<00:00:56.030> but

00:00:56.529 --> 00:00:56.539 
frets to make any minor obviously but

00:00:56.539 --> 00:00:59.649 
frets to make any minor obviously but
you're<00:00:56.719> playing<00:00:56.929> the<00:00:57.049> D<00:00:57.199> over<00:00:57.469> there<00:00:57.589> -<00:00:57.890> oh<00:00:58.659> so

00:00:59.649 --> 00:00:59.659 
you're playing the D over there - oh so

00:00:59.659 --> 00:01:03.240 
you're playing the D over there - oh so
you<00:00:59.750> go<00:00:59.839> between<00:00:59.960> those<00:01:00.229> two<00:01:00.439> chords

00:01:03.240 --> 00:01:03.250 

00:01:03.250 --> 00:01:05.189 

I<00:01:03.370> find<00:01:03.940> it<00:01:04.030> easier<00:01:04.269> to<00:01:04.330> play<00:01:04.449> the<00:01:04.570> d6<00:01:04.960> with<00:01:05.080> my

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:05.199 
I find it easier to play the d6 with my

00:01:05.199 --> 00:01:06.720 
I find it easier to play the d6 with my
third<00:01:05.440> and<00:01:05.590> fourth<00:01:05.770> fingers<00:01:06.130> because<00:01:06.490> of<00:01:06.550> the

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:06.730 
third and fourth fingers because of the

00:01:06.730 --> 00:01:08.760 
third and fourth fingers because of the
next<00:01:06.970> chord<00:01:07.240> you<00:01:07.360> can<00:01:07.390> just<00:01:07.660> slide<00:01:07.900> slide<00:01:08.650> it

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:08.770 
next chord you can just slide slide it

00:01:08.770 --> 00:01:16.290 
next chord you can just slide slide it

00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:55.890 
sounds nice as a be minus 70 point and

00:01:55.890 --> 00:02:00.520 
sounds nice as a be minus 70 point and
he<00:01:56.780> back<00:01:57.780> to<00:01:57.930> the<00:01:57.990> E<00:01:58.080> minor<00:01:58.320> 7<00:01:58.740> and<00:01:58.950> answer

00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:00.530 
he back to the E minor 7 and answer

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:02.890 
he back to the E minor 7 and answer
and<00:02:00.710> the<00:02:00.830> i7<00:02:01.370> again<00:02:01.580> lots<00:02:02.180> of<00:02:02.300> sevenths<00:02:02.780> in

00:02:02.890 --> 00:02:02.900 
and the i7 again lots of sevenths in

00:02:02.900 --> 00:02:16.440 
and the i7 again lots of sevenths in
there<00:02:03.110> so<00:02:05.770> to<00:02:06.770> know

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:16.450 

00:02:16.450 --> 00:02:21.010 

and<00:02:17.450> the<00:02:17.630> chorus<00:02:18.790> d-minor<00:02:19.790> you'll<00:02:20.720> be<00:02:20.810> getting

00:02:21.010 --> 00:02:21.020 
and the chorus d-minor you'll be getting

00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:25.150

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:27.580 
between a D minor and a D minor
I<00:02:25.190> think<00:02:25.670> it's<00:02:25.790> augmented<00:02:26.450> being<00:02:27.350> behind<00:02:27.440> a

00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:27.590 
I think it's augmented being behind a

00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:30.100 
I think it's augmented being behind a
portmanteau<00:02:27.860> is<00:02:28.280> basically<00:02:28.820> just<00:02:28.910> a<00:02:29.300> needy

00:02:30.100 --> 00:02:30.110 
portmanteau is basically just a needy

00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:31.480 
portmanteau is basically just a needy
modern<00:02:30.470> they're<00:02:30.590> just<00:02:30.740> using<00:02:30.890> your<00:02:31.040> pinky<00:02:31.370> on

00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:31.490 
modern they're just using your pinky on

00:02:31.490 --> 00:02:34.320 
modern they're just using your pinky on
to<00:02:31.670> the<00:02:31.760> third<00:02:31.940> fret<00:02:32.180> and<00:02:32.240> a<00:02:32.360> third<00:02:32.570> string

00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:34.330 
to the third fret and a third string

00:02:34.330 --> 00:02:44.880 
to the third fret and a third string
