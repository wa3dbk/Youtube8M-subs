this<00:01:37.229> is<00:01:37.380> one<00:01:37.530> of<00:01:37.560> those<00:01:37.710> games<00:01:37.950> that<00:01:38.159> was

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:38.310 
this is one of those games that was

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:40.010 
this is one of those games that was
shown<00:01:38.490> at<00:01:38.640> this<00:01:38.790> e3<00:01:39.000> and<00:01:39.360> it's<00:01:39.659> not<00:01:39.810> going<00:01:39.930> to

00:01:40.010 --> 00:01:40.020 
shown at this e3 and it's not going to

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:42.499 
shown at this e3 and it's not going to
be<00:01:40.110> out<00:01:40.229> until<00:01:40.380> next<00:01:40.710> year<00:01:41.240> Bethesda<00:01:42.240> also

be out until next year Bethesda also

00:01:42.509 --> 00:01:44.569 
be out until next year Bethesda also
should<00:01:42.689> a<00:01:42.720> game<00:01:42.960> called<00:01:43.170> range<00:01:43.530> it's<00:01:43.829> also

00:01:44.569 --> 00:01:44.579 
should a game called range it's also

00:01:44.579 --> 00:01:46.429 
should a game called range it's also
kind<00:01:44.939> of<00:01:45.030> like<00:01:45.149> Borderlands<00:01:45.750> it<00:01:45.869> almost<00:01:46.229> has

00:01:46.429 --> 00:01:46.439 
kind of like Borderlands it almost has

00:01:46.439 --> 00:01:48.260 
kind of like Borderlands it almost has
the<00:01:46.470> same<00:01:46.799> art<00:01:47.040> style<00:01:47.369> it's<00:01:47.850> not<00:01:48.060> as

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:48.270 
the same art style it's not as

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:50.210 
the same art style it's not as
watercolor<00:01:48.840> cel-shaded<00:01:49.560> that<00:01:49.740> kind<00:01:49.979> of<00:01:50.009> look

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:50.220 
watercolor cel-shaded that kind of look

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:52.219 
watercolor cel-shaded that kind of look
to<00:01:50.250> it<00:01:50.399> but<00:01:50.790> it<00:01:51.360> still<00:01:52.049> has<00:01:52.170> that

00:01:52.219 --> 00:01:52.229 
to it but it still has that

00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:55.520 
to it but it still has that
post-apocalyptic<00:01:53.189> feel<00:01:53.750> and<00:01:54.750> almost<00:01:55.170> it

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:55.530 
post-apocalyptic feel and almost it

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:57.410 
post-apocalyptic feel and almost it
seems<00:01:55.950> like<00:01:56.159> it<00:01:56.280> has<00:01:56.430> that<00:01:56.610> kind<00:01:56.820> of<00:01:56.939> humor<00:01:57.240> to

00:01:57.410 --> 00:01:57.420 
seems like it has that kind of humor to

00:01:57.420 --> 00:02:00.380 
seems like it has that kind of humor to
it<00:01:57.450> there's<00:01:58.549> there's<00:01:59.549> a<00:01:59.640> much<00:01:59.850> more<00:02:00.090> lively

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:00.390 
it there's there's a much more lively

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:03.160 
it there's there's a much more lively
feel<00:02:00.930> to<00:02:01.229> rage<00:02:01.409> though<00:02:01.680> whereas<00:02:02.369> in

00:02:03.160 --> 00:02:03.170 
feel to rage though whereas in

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:04.999 
feel to rage though whereas in
Borderlands<00:02:04.170> everything<00:02:04.530> seems<00:02:04.799> very

00:02:04.999 --> 00:02:05.009 
Borderlands everything seems very

00:02:05.009 --> 00:02:06.310 
Borderlands everything seems very
constricted<00:02:05.729> there<00:02:06.030> is<00:02:06.149> a

00:02:06.310 --> 00:02:06.320 
constricted there is a

00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:08.100 
constricted there is a
a<00:02:06.350> few<00:02:06.590> people<00:02:06.950> here<00:02:07.130> and<00:02:07.190> there<00:02:07.310> there<00:02:08.030> are

00:02:08.100 --> 00:02:08.110 
a few people here and there there are

00:02:08.110 --> 00:02:10.210 
a few people here and there there are
settlements<00:02:09.110> in<00:02:09.410> this<00:02:09.560> game<00:02:09.740> where<00:02:09.979> there's<00:02:10.130> a

00:02:10.210 --> 00:02:10.220 
settlements in this game where there's a

00:02:10.220 --> 00:02:11.860 
settlements in this game where there's a
lot<00:02:10.369> of<00:02:10.399> people<00:02:10.789> and<00:02:11.000> they're<00:02:11.360> interacting

00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:11.870 
lot of people and they're interacting

00:02:11.870 --> 00:02:12.760 
lot of people and they're interacting
with<00:02:11.990> each<00:02:12.020> other<00:02:12.230> they're<00:02:12.530> not<00:02:12.650> just

00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:12.770 
with each other they're not just

00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:14.980 
with each other they're not just
standing<00:02:13.160> against<00:02:13.460> a<00:02:13.520> wall<00:02:13.720> so<00:02:14.720> with<00:02:14.870> that

00:02:14.980 --> 00:02:14.990 
standing against a wall so with that

00:02:14.990 --> 00:02:17.260 
standing against a wall so with that
concept<00:02:15.500> it's<00:02:15.709> almost<00:02:15.950> more<00:02:16.190> like<00:02:16.220> fallout<00:02:16.790> 3

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:17.270 
concept it's almost more like fallout 3

00:02:17.270 --> 00:02:19.210 
concept it's almost more like fallout 3
to<00:02:17.870> steer<00:02:18.080> further<00:02:18.380> away<00:02:18.530> from<00:02:18.650> both<00:02:19.010> of<00:02:19.040> the

00:02:19.210 --> 00:02:19.220 
to steer further away from both of the

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:20.620 
to steer further away from both of the
other<00:02:19.250> games<00:02:19.610> that<00:02:19.700> I<00:02:19.820> compare<00:02:20.150> it<00:02:20.240> to<00:02:20.390> this

00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:20.630 
other games that I compare it to this

00:02:20.630 --> 00:02:23.290 
other games that I compare it to this
game<00:02:20.900> seems<00:02:21.140> a<00:02:21.380> lot<00:02:21.620> more<00:02:21.650> quick<00:02:22.190> paced<00:02:22.490> all

00:02:23.290 --> 00:02:23.300 
game seems a lot more quick paced all

00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:25.060 
game seems a lot more quick paced all
the<00:02:23.510> combat<00:02:23.900> that<00:02:24.050> they<00:02:24.140> should<00:02:24.410> seemed<00:02:24.860> like

00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:25.070 
the combat that they should seemed like

00:02:25.070 --> 00:02:27.520 
the combat that they should seemed like
things<00:02:25.250> were<00:02:25.400> rushing<00:02:25.790> at<00:02:25.940> you<00:02:26.080> it<00:02:27.080> wasn't<00:02:27.320> you

cooperative<00:03:19.610> multiplayer<00:03:19.959> from<00:03:20.959> what<00:03:21.110> I

gather<00:03:21.440> from<00:03:21.560> the<00:03:22.010> trailer<00:03:22.310> it<00:03:22.610> seems<00:03:22.940> like

00:03:23.199 --> 00:03:23.209 
gather from the trailer it seems like

00:03:23.209 --> 00:03:24.880 
gather from the trailer it seems like
it's<00:03:23.450> supposed<00:03:23.750> to<00:03:23.900> be<00:03:24.049> a<00:03:24.079> healthy<00:03:24.410> balance<00:03:24.769> of

00:03:24.880 --> 00:03:24.890 
it's supposed to be a healthy balance of

00:03:24.890 --> 00:03:26.979 
it's supposed to be a healthy balance of
melee<00:03:25.220> versus<00:03:25.579> ranged<00:03:25.910> combat<00:03:26.060> and<00:03:26.570> you're

00:03:26.979 --> 00:03:26.989 
melee versus ranged combat and you're

00:03:26.989 --> 00:03:29.620 
melee versus ranged combat and you're
supposed<00:03:27.350> to<00:03:27.620> work<00:03:28.430> together<00:03:28.850> to<00:03:29.239> make<00:03:29.480> sure

00:03:29.620 --> 00:03:29.630 
supposed to work together to make sure

00:03:29.630 --> 00:03:31.330 
supposed to work together to make sure
that<00:03:29.780> you<00:03:29.840> reach<00:03:30.049> your<00:03:30.170> goals<00:03:30.380> but<00:03:30.950> besides

00:03:31.330 --> 00:03:31.340 
that you reach your goals but besides

00:03:31.340 --> 00:03:33.130 
that you reach your goals but besides
that<00:03:31.459> there<00:03:31.700> wasn't<00:03:31.880> really<00:03:32.090> too<00:03:32.420> much<00:03:32.450> to<00:03:32.720> get

00:03:33.130 --> 00:03:33.140 
that there wasn't really too much to get

00:03:33.140 --> 00:03:34.750 
that there wasn't really too much to get
from<00:03:33.410> the<00:03:33.500> trailer<00:03:33.860> so<00:03:34.040> we'll<00:03:34.340> have<00:03:34.430> to<00:03:34.579> wait

00:03:34.750 --> 00:03:34.760 
from the trailer so we'll have to wait

00:03:34.760 --> 00:03:36.670 
from the trailer so we'll have to wait
until<00:03:34.940> more<00:03:35.390> information<00:03:35.840> comes<00:03:36.019> out<00:03:36.230> this

00:03:36.670 --> 00:03:36.680 
until more information comes out this

00:03:36.680 --> 00:03:39.220 
until more information comes out this
seemed<00:03:36.950> more<00:03:37.430> like<00:03:37.579> a<00:03:37.700> teaser<00:03:38.060> than<00:03:38.420> anything

00:03:39.220 --> 00:03:39.230 
seemed more like a teaser than anything

00:03:39.230 --> 00:03:41.470 
seemed more like a teaser than anything
substantial<00:03:39.650> finally<00:03:40.489> another<00:03:40.640> anticipated
