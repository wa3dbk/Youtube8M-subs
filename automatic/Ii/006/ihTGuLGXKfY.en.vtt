00:01:42.320 --> 00:01:42.330 
you know this D dimensions are appearing

00:01:42.330 --> 00:01:47.090 
you know this D dimensions are appearing
on<00:01:42.540> that<00:01:42.810> sketch<00:01:43.770> and<00:01:44.640> also<00:01:45.030> one<00:01:45.210> thing<00:01:46.100> you

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:49.110 
are able to edit to the machine outside

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:54.860 
are able to edit to the machine outside
the<00:01:49.950> sketch<00:01:50.190> node<00:01:50.520> as<00:01:51.060> well<00:01:51.510> so<00:01:51.870> you<00:01:51.990> can<00:01:53.870> see

00:01:54.860 --> 00:01:54.870 
the sketch node as well so you can see

00:01:54.870 --> 00:01:57.080 
the sketch node as well so you can see
this<00:01:55.020> is<00:01:55.140> a<00:01:55.170> new<00:01:55.380> feature<00:01:55.620> in<00:01:55.950> this<00:01:56.280> way<00:01:56.550> then

00:01:57.080 --> 00:01:57.090 
this is a new feature in this way then

00:01:57.090 --> 00:01:59.539 
this is a new feature in this way then
you<00:01:57.270> so<00:01:57.630> do<00:01:57.780> X<00:01:57.930> versions<00:01:58.500> that<00:01:59.250> they<00:01:59.490> are

00:01:59.539 --> 00:01:59.549 
you so do X versions that they are

00:01:59.549 --> 00:02:02.450 
you so do X versions that they are
saving<00:01:59.820> times<00:02:00.240> you<00:02:00.870> are<00:02:01.049> able<00:02:01.229> to<00:02:01.460> change

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:02.460 
saving times you are able to change

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:20.250 
saving times you are able to change
dimension<00:02:03.120> here<00:02:03.330> directly

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:20.260 

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:23.680

00:03:17.300 --> 00:03:20.590 
so let's select that sketch extrude it
so<00:03:18.140> now<00:03:18.380> you<00:03:18.440> are<00:03:18.560> able<00:03:18.950> to<00:03:19.010> shoot<00:03:19.400> so<00:03:20.330> this<00:03:20.480> is

00:03:20.590 --> 00:03:20.600 
so now you are able to shoot so this is

00:03:20.600 --> 00:03:25.720 
so now you are able to shoot so this is
a<00:03:20.870> very<00:03:21.440> fast<00:03:21.770> start<00:03:23.290> to<00:03:24.290> give<00:03:24.470> you<00:03:24.620> an<00:03:25.280> idea

00:03:25.720 --> 00:03:25.730 
a very fast start to give you an idea

00:03:25.730 --> 00:03:29.500 
a very fast start to give you an idea
how<00:03:26.540> you<00:03:26.600> going<00:03:27.140> to<00:03:27.500> use<00:03:27.680> your<00:03:27.980> sketches<00:03:28.730> so

00:03:29.500 --> 00:03:29.510 
how you going to use your sketches so

00:03:29.510 --> 00:03:33.070 
how you going to use your sketches so
either<00:03:29.660> you<00:03:29.900> can<00:03:29.930> extrude<00:03:30.500> through<00:03:30.890> vol.3<00:03:32.080> cut

00:03:33.070 --> 00:03:33.080 
either you can extrude through vol.3 cut

00:03:33.080 --> 00:03:35.740 
either you can extrude through vol.3 cut
and<00:03:33.380> so<00:03:33.860> on<00:03:34.070> we<00:03:34.940> are<00:03:35.060> going<00:03:35.300> to<00:03:35.420> talk<00:03:35.600> about

00:03:35.740 --> 00:03:35.750 
and so on we are going to talk about

00:03:35.750 --> 00:03:41.080 
and so on we are going to talk about
this<00:03:36.200> feature<00:03:36.800> in<00:03:37.160> the<00:03:37.220> future<00:03:38.080> tutorials
