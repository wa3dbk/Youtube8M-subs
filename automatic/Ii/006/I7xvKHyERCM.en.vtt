00:00:08.300 --> 00:00:12.570
 wolfgang has its near munich 

00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:14.849
 workshop he has his hobby to profession 

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:17.400
 made and dedicated preferably to the 

00:00:14.849 --> 00:00:19.980
 Delorean back from the past 

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:22.109
 heard the sports car in the 80s 

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:24.330
 years car and film history wrote 

00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:26.600
 with the craziest models today 

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:26.600
 cult character 

00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:35.130
 the first thing that hits Berlin in the eye 

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:36.900
 of course the stainless steel body of the 

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:38.220
 Stainless steel is brushed otherwise 

00:00:36.900 --> 00:00:39.570
 completely untreated is none 

00:00:38.220 --> 00:00:41.940
 paint or something else 

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:44.699
 required the overall design of the 

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:47.129
 car comes from italy from chicago 

00:00:44.699 --> 00:00:49.460
 italdesign was the end of the 

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:51.930
 seventies created this whole design 

00:00:49.460 --> 00:00:54.960
 the next highlight of theories are 

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:58.050
 Of course, the French doors are the wing door 

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:59.850
 is relatively heavy and big because 

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:00.630
 Of course you have a lot of components in it 

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:02.010
 we have the here 

00:01:00.630 --> 00:01:03.329
 Central locking we have the 

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:05.190
 electric windows 

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:06.500
 the vehicle had for then 

00:01:05.190 --> 00:01:09.060
 conditions already a relative 

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:10.710
 extensive comfort features the 

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:14.420
 The vehicle already has an air conditioning system 

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:16.619
 he has leather seats has a leather steering wheel 

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:20.000
 so far, the whole thing is already here 

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:20.000
 well equipped 

00:01:21.289 --> 00:01:24.800
 Porsche had that at the time 

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:26.910
 Development contract for the delorean 

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:28.830
 rejected, therefore, the car is based 

00:01:26.910 --> 00:01:31.619
 as far as possible on the chassis of the 

00:01:28.830 --> 00:01:33.810
 then lotus it comes brad the tail 

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:35.610
 a relatively simple six-cylinder 

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:38.509
 series engine from peugeot renault and 

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:38.509
 Volvo for use 

00:01:38.569 --> 00:01:43.530
 v6 engine 

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:45.330
 the so-called pvv 6 was from peugeot 

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:47.399
 renault and volvo designed and 

00:01:45.330 --> 00:01:50.250
 but this version is constructed 

00:01:47.399 --> 00:01:52.530
 only the new ones are there 

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:55.099
 this variant in no other 

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:57.300
 vehicle from the other manufacturers 

00:01:55.099 --> 00:01:59.160
 originally as a mid-engined sports car 

00:01:57.300 --> 00:02:01.050
 had to be designed the rear part of the 

00:01:59.160 --> 00:02:03.179
 by the installation of the big car 

00:02:01.050 --> 00:02:07.130
 heavy pro 6 motors to a pure 

00:02:03.179 --> 00:02:10.619
 Rear engine vehicle to be rebuilt 

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:13.500
 but his tail engine something own 

00:02:10.619 --> 00:02:14.820
 However, landing gear behaves 

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:16.710
 especially on dry pavement also in 

00:02:14.820 --> 00:02:18.720
 Fleet turns extremely neutral 

00:02:16.710 --> 00:02:22.200
 the car is really fun 

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:24.720
 swiftly over the country road years before 6 

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:28.110
 1 432 ps and makes for a tempo of 

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:30.150
 maximum 200 km h what now here behind 

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:31.530
 The big ones are still in the eye 

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:34.080
 bumpers come out by the way 

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:37.920
 germany the bumpers were added 

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:39.630
 phoenix in hamburg also manufactures the 

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:42.390
 Upper two covers come off 

00:02:39.630 --> 00:02:46.710
 german production derives from the 

00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:48.630
 company photo cell from augsburg in the 70s 

00:02:46.710 --> 00:02:51.180
 at the beginning of the 80s not typical 

00:02:48.630 --> 00:02:53.640
 that you have full-surface bumpers as 

00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:56.550
 element of a body used 

00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:57.420
 has already got very good here 

00:02:56.550 --> 00:02:59.520
 implemented 

00:02:57.420 --> 00:03:01.830
 we have the original performance 

00:02:59.520 --> 00:03:04.440
 That's why design is very concise 

00:03:01.830 --> 00:03:07.110
 for the time and also typical the 

00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:08.070
 lorien what you see here the little one 

00:03:07.110 --> 00:03:09.570
 side window 

00:03:08.070 --> 00:03:10.650
 originally was a first 

00:03:09.570 --> 00:03:12.630
 construction a sliding window 

00:03:10.650 --> 00:03:14.400
 only thought then it has the 

00:03:12.630 --> 00:03:16.650
 Designers did not like it then 

00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:18.060
 on this small electrically retractable 

00:03:16.650 --> 00:03:20.010
 side window passed 

00:03:18.060 --> 00:03:22.800
 thus already have a topic big 

00:03:20.010 --> 00:03:24.810
 glass surfaces large internal warming without 

00:03:22.800 --> 00:03:27.600
 Air conditioning in the summer is the right way 

00:03:24.810 --> 00:03:29.580
 was famous with the car is the 

00:03:27.600 --> 00:03:32.040
 Delorean through the film series back in 

00:03:29.580 --> 00:03:33.959
 the future ex gm vice-president john 

00:03:32.040 --> 00:03:35.160
 delorean has been dreaming of you for a long time 

00:03:33.959 --> 00:03:37.440
 own sports car 

00:03:35.160 --> 00:03:39.270
 he is going to ireland because here gets 

00:03:37.440 --> 00:03:41.610
 the 100 million pound support 

00:03:39.270 --> 00:03:44.040
 by the government for the construction of his 

00:03:41.610 --> 00:03:44.970
 company also sammy davis junior &amp; johnson 

00:03:44.040 --> 00:03:46.620
 invest 

00:03:44.970 --> 00:03:49.739
 Nevertheless, the company stands by the 

00:03:46.620 --> 00:03:52.430
 automobile crisis in 1980 just before 

00:03:49.739 --> 00:03:56.480
 after only 9000 cars produced 

00:03:52.430 --> 00:03:56.480
 1982 final 

00:03:56.950 --> 00:04:00.620
 due to the golden credit card 

00:03:59.629 --> 00:04:04.310
 american express 

00:04:00.620 --> 00:04:06.890
 still 1981 2 delorean with 24 carat 

00:04:04.310 --> 00:04:10.540
 There is a total of gold galvanizing 

00:04:06.890 --> 00:04:10.540
 today three golden delorean 

00:04:11.120 --> 00:04:17.900
 the golden one was an idea of ​​john 

00:04:14.940 --> 00:04:20.280
 delorean and american express 

00:04:17.900 --> 00:04:22.260
 The target was an edition of 100 pieces 

00:04:20.280 --> 00:04:23.850
 but it was not feasible 

00:04:22.260 --> 00:04:26.280
 were effectively out of this action 

00:04:23.850 --> 00:04:28.110
 Two vehicles produced the third 

00:04:26.280 --> 00:04:30.840
 vehicle because the last vehicle is 

00:04:28.110 --> 00:04:34.650
 ran at all the tape was from 

00:04:30.840 --> 00:04:36.570
 bankruptcy trustee at the end of 82 the 

00:04:34.650 --> 00:04:38.400
 company has liquidated theories 

00:04:36.570 --> 00:04:39.960
 then this vehicle for yourself 

00:04:38.400 --> 00:04:41.660
 assembled and it just next to it 

00:04:39.960 --> 00:04:44.669
 took 

00:04:41.660 --> 00:04:46.980
 wolfgang is the delorean specialist in 

00:04:44.669 --> 00:04:51.390
 europe has problems with its customers 

00:04:46.980 --> 00:04:53.970
 often more than 1000 kilometers to anni 

00:04:51.390 --> 00:04:56.780
 and uncomplicated there is every part 

00:04:53.970 --> 00:04:59.550
 to buy new or in exchange 

00:04:56.780 --> 00:05:01.200
 except for the left front fender 

00:04:59.550 --> 00:05:03.419
 because after closing the factory were 

00:05:01.200 --> 00:05:07.140
 mocking the tools for and for 

00:05:03.419 --> 00:05:08.370
 Part of the sea sinks the vehicle is 

00:05:07.140 --> 00:05:09.990
 basically very uncomplicated 

00:05:08.370 --> 00:05:11.820
 built on the basis of mass production technology 

00:05:09.990 --> 00:05:13.410
 the built-in we have the engine of 

00:05:11.820 --> 00:05:15.510
 Renault have the transmission from Hanover 

00:05:13.410 --> 00:05:17.820
 the injection of bosch we have the 

00:05:15.510 --> 00:05:19.740
 Whole electronics and igniter plant of 

00:05:17.820 --> 00:05:21.750
 bosch we have electric forward from lukas 

00:05:19.740 --> 00:05:25.050
 and from bosch it is comparatively 

00:05:21.750 --> 00:05:26.610
 uncomplicated set up the lines 

00:05:25.050 --> 00:05:28.410
 There was optional with a five-speed 

00:05:26.610 --> 00:05:32.160
 manual or a three-speed 

00:05:28.410 --> 00:05:33.450
 Automatic is not complicated either 

00:05:32.160 --> 00:05:34.740
 as with the other car is 

00:05:33.450 --> 00:05:36.479
 of course, in principle 

00:05:34.740 --> 00:05:38.370
 to consider legislations of physics 

00:05:36.479 --> 00:05:40.620
 and on wet roads it can be on the 

00:05:38.370 --> 00:05:42.790
 be critical behind the rear axle 

00:05:40.620 --> 00:05:44.740
 otherwise the car drives like any other 

00:05:42.790 --> 00:05:45.940
 other car too it is comparatively 

00:05:44.740 --> 00:05:47.770
 unexciting 

00:05:45.940 --> 00:05:50.470
 by the big year's components the 

00:05:47.770 --> 00:05:55.300
 here are still installed wolfgang 

00:05:50.470 --> 00:05:58.690
 stallone something special we have here 

00:05:55.300 --> 00:06:02.380
 a delorean from the first series at 

00:05:58.690 --> 00:06:04.930
 The hood still has the first series 

00:06:02.380 --> 00:06:07.780
 squashed and has here too 

00:06:04.930 --> 00:06:09.250
 even the tank flap is the tank flap 

00:06:07.780 --> 00:06:16.840
 here in the case exclusively 

00:06:09.250 --> 00:06:18.370
 to electrically open the delorean a 

00:06:16.840 --> 00:06:22.110
 80s classic in the 

00:06:18.370 --> 00:06:22.110
 twenty-first century
