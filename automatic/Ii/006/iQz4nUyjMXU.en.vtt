in<00:00:39.510> this<00:00:39.660> episode<00:00:40.110> we're<00:00:40.380> covering<00:00:40.410> the<00:00:40.680> three

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:40.710 
in this episode we're covering the three

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:42.410 
in this episode we're covering the three
stages<00:00:41.250> of<00:00:41.430> the<00:00:41.700> electronic<00:00:42.240> stability

stages of the electronic stability

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:45.070 
stages of the electronic stability
program<00:00:43.550> we're<00:00:44.550> gonna<00:00:44.610> do<00:00:44.820> whatever

00:00:45.070 --> 00:00:45.080 
program we're gonna do whatever

00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:47.690 
program we're gonna do whatever
reasonably<00:00:46.080> thoughtful<00:00:46.950> driver<00:00:47.190> would<00:00:47.460> do

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:47.700 
reasonably thoughtful driver would do

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:49.790 
reasonably thoughtful driver would do
and<00:00:47.970> that<00:00:48.000> is<00:00:48.630> we're<00:00:48.990> asking<00:00:49.290> ourselves<00:00:49.410> to

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:49.800 
and that is we're asking ourselves to

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:51.920 
and that is we're asking ourselves to
drive<00:00:50.070> at<00:00:50.430> a<00:00:50.490> hundred<00:00:50.760> percent<00:00:50.970> which<00:00:51.780> we're

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:51.930 
drive at a hundred percent which we're

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:54.950 
drive at a hundred percent which we're
about<00:00:52.020> to<00:00:52.170> do<00:00:52.910> to<00:00:53.910> build<00:00:54.090> up<00:00:54.300> to<00:00:54.510> it<00:00:54.540> to<00:00:54.750> walk

about to do to build up to it to walk
before<00:00:55.200> we<00:00:55.380> run<00:00:55.500> so<00:00:56.010> we<00:00:56.550> need<00:00:56.730> to<00:00:56.970> take<00:00:57.870> the

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:21.270 
you will our first run is gonna be in

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:23.330 
you will our first run is gonna be in
our<00:01:21.420> first<00:01:21.810> stretch<00:01:22.260> at<00:01:22.470> control<00:01:22.800> mode<00:01:23.070> and

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:23.340 
our first stretch at control mode and

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:25.250 
our first stretch at control mode and
basically<00:01:23.700> what<00:01:23.909> it's<00:01:24.030> going<00:01:24.060> to<00:01:24.180> do<00:01:24.420> is<00:01:24.990> going

00:01:25.250 --> 00:01:25.260 
basically what it's going to do is going

00:01:25.260 --> 00:01:26.930 
basically what it's going to do is going
to<00:01:25.320> not<00:01:25.530> allow<00:01:25.770> the<00:01:25.830> car<00:01:26.190> to<00:01:26.370> break<00:01:26.549> that<00:01:26.729> much

00:01:26.930 --> 00:01:26.940 
to not allow the car to break that much

00:01:26.940 --> 00:01:29.180 
to not allow the car to break that much
traction<00:01:27.240> once<00:01:27.960> it<00:01:28.110> gets<00:01:28.320> to<00:01:28.409> a<00:01:28.500> certain<00:01:28.620> y'all

00:01:29.190 --> 00:01:32.240 
traction once it gets to a certain y'all
after<00:01:29.670> just<00:01:30.150> a<00:01:30.240> few<00:01:30.270> degrees<00:01:30.600> these<00:01:31.350> computer

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:32.250 
after just a few degrees these computer

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:33.500 
after just a few degrees these computer
will<00:01:32.400> kick<00:01:32.640> in<00:01:32.790> and<00:01:32.940> say<00:01:33.060> that's<00:01:33.180> enough

00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:33.510 
will kick in and say that's enough

00:01:33.510 --> 00:01:35.390 
will kick in and say that's enough
sliding<00:01:33.960> as<00:01:34.140> we<00:01:34.350> build<00:01:34.620> up<00:01:34.710> the<00:01:34.860> pace<00:01:35.070> here<00:01:35.280> I'm

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:35.400 
sliding as we build up the pace here I'm

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:37.760 
sliding as we build up the pace here I'm
gonna<00:01:35.549> try<00:01:35.880> to<00:01:36.720> slide<00:01:37.020> the<00:01:37.229> car<00:01:37.470> down<00:01:37.740> here

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:37.770 
gonna try to slide the car down here

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:40.100 
gonna try to slide the car down here
turn<00:01:38.190> three<00:01:38.610> basically<00:01:39.540> no<00:01:39.630> matter<00:01:39.840> what<00:01:40.080> I

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:40.110 
turn three basically no matter what I

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:41.719 
turn three basically no matter what I
try<00:01:40.470> to<00:01:40.500> do<00:01:40.799> it's<00:01:40.979> gonna<00:01:41.100> make<00:01:41.310> it<00:01:41.460> real

00:01:41.719 --> 00:01:41.729 
try to do it's gonna make it real

00:01:41.729 --> 00:01:44.840 
try to do it's gonna make it real
difficult<00:01:42.360> for<00:01:42.510> this<00:01:42.600> car<00:01:42.810> to<00:01:42.930> slide<00:01:43.430> so<00:01:44.430> each

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:44.850 
difficult for this car to slide so each

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:47.420 
difficult for this car to slide so each
mode<00:01:45.240> takes<00:01:45.690> a<00:01:45.840> little<00:01:46.020> bit<00:01:46.260> more<00:01:46.500> of<00:01:46.770> the<00:01:46.950> the

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:47.430 
mode takes a little bit more of the the

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:48.140 
mode takes a little bit more of the the
Beast<00:01:47.670> Within

Beast Within

00:01:48.150 --> 00:01:49.609

driver<00:01:49.860> and<00:01:50.130> at<00:01:50.880> the<00:01:51.000> same<00:01:51.180> time<00:01:51.479> adds<00:01:51.750> a<00:01:51.900> lot

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:52.140 
driver and at the same time adds a lot

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:54.200 
driver and at the same time adds a lot
more<00:01:52.409> responsibility<00:01:53.220> what<00:01:53.970> we're<00:01:54.060> going<00:01:54.180> to

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:54.210 
more responsibility what we're going to

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:56.840 
more responsibility what we're going to
do<00:01:54.360> now<00:01:54.510> is<00:01:54.689> go<00:01:54.810> to<00:01:54.840> our<00:01:54.960> second<00:01:55.850> stability

00:01:56.840 --> 00:01:56.850 
do now is go to our second stability

00:01:56.850 --> 00:01:59.450 
do now is go to our second stability
mode<00:01:57.000> which<00:01:57.330> is<00:01:57.600> sport<00:01:58.380> mode<00:01:58.560> that<00:01:59.040> allows<00:01:59.250> the

00:01:59.450 --> 00:01:59.460 
mode which is sport mode that allows the

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:01.520 
mode which is sport mode that allows the
driver<00:01:59.670> to<00:01:59.850> push<00:02:00.119> the<00:02:00.299> pedals<00:02:00.630> harder<00:02:01.290> but<00:02:01.409> at

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:01.530 
driver to push the pedals harder but at

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:03.440 
driver to push the pedals harder but at
the<00:02:01.619> same<00:02:01.770> point<00:02:01.830> that<00:02:02.640> computer<00:02:03.119> will<00:02:03.299> not

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:03.450 
the same point that computer will not

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:06.080 
the same point that computer will not
intervene<00:02:03.840> until<00:02:04.500> the<00:02:05.130> yaw<00:02:05.340> angle<00:02:05.700> is

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:06.090 
intervene until the yaw angle is

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:08.820 
intervene until the yaw angle is
substantially<00:02:07.049> greater

00:02:08.820 --> 00:02:08.830 
substantially greater

00:02:08.830 --> 00:02:12.570 
substantially greater
so<00:02:09.430> a<00:02:09.460> little<00:02:09.640> bit<00:02:09.820> of<00:02:09.910> rotation<00:02:11.340> not<00:02:12.340> gonna

00:02:12.570 --> 00:02:12.580 
so a little bit of rotation not gonna

00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:14.460 
so a little bit of rotation not gonna
happen<00:02:13.060> so<00:02:13.690> you<00:02:13.720> can<00:02:13.870> get<00:02:13.960> a<00:02:14.020> little<00:02:14.200> bit<00:02:14.380> of

00:02:14.460 --> 00:02:14.470 
happen so you can get a little bit of

00:02:14.470 --> 00:02:16.170 
happen so you can get a little bit of
rotation<00:02:14.590> from<00:02:15.160> your<00:02:15.280> ear<00:02:15.430> in<00:02:15.550> but<00:02:15.730> as<00:02:15.850> soon<00:02:16.060> as

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:16.180 
rotation from your ear in but as soon as

00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:17.700 
rotation from your ear in but as soon as
that<00:02:16.360> rear<00:02:16.570> end<00:02:16.600> feels<00:02:17.050> that<00:02:17.350> the<00:02:17.500> cars

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:17.710 
that rear end feels that the cars

00:02:17.710 --> 00:02:19.650 
that rear end feels that the cars
slipping<00:02:18.010> it's<00:02:18.670> gonna<00:02:18.880> add<00:02:19.150> a<00:02:19.180> little<00:02:19.390> bit<00:02:19.630> of

00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:19.660 
slipping it's gonna add a little bit of

00:02:19.660 --> 00:02:21.900 
slipping it's gonna add a little bit of
that<00:02:19.900> stability<00:02:20.140> program<00:02:20.770> can't<00:02:21.610> say<00:02:21.850> it

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:21.910 
that stability program can't say it

00:02:21.910 --> 00:02:24.030 
that stability program can't say it
enough<00:02:22.120> your<00:02:22.330> margin<00:02:22.750> for<00:02:22.960> error<00:02:23.230> goes<00:02:23.650> way<00:02:24.010> up

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:24.040 
enough your margin for error goes way up

00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:26.490 
enough your margin for error goes way up
as<00:02:24.790> soon<00:02:25.090> as<00:02:25.210> you<00:02:25.300> start<00:02:25.630> disabling<00:02:26.380> a

00:02:26.490 --> 00:02:26.500 
as soon as you start disabling a

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:29.610 
as soon as you start disabling a
stability<00:02:26.740> program<00:02:28.020> so<00:02:29.020> what<00:02:29.380> we're<00:02:29.470> going<00:02:29.560> to

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:29.620 
stability program so what we're going to

00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:31.230 
stability program so what we're going to
do<00:02:29.770> this<00:02:29.920> time<00:02:30.190> is<00:02:30.760> we're<00:02:31.060> going<00:02:31.180> to

00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:31.240 
do this time is we're going to

00:02:31.240 --> 00:02:33.600 
do this time is we're going to
completely<00:02:31.840> disable<00:02:32.290> our<00:02:32.680> stability<00:02:32.980> program

00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:33.610 
completely disable our stability program

00:02:33.610 --> 00:02:36.810 
completely disable our stability program
which<00:02:34.240> will<00:02:34.990> 100%<00:02:35.470> take<00:02:36.100> away<00:02:36.280> our<00:02:36.310> traction

00:02:36.810 --> 00:02:36.820 
which will 100% take away our traction

00:02:36.820 --> 00:02:39.480 
which will 100% take away our traction
control<00:02:37.270> so<00:02:37.990> basically<00:02:38.440> the<00:02:39.100> amount<00:02:39.310> of

00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:39.490 
control so basically the amount of

00:02:39.490 --> 00:02:41.400 
control so basically the amount of
energy<00:02:39.850> I'm<00:02:40.150> giving<00:02:40.450> that<00:02:40.600> long<00:02:40.780> skinny<00:02:40.990> pedal

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:41.410 
energy I'm giving that long skinny pedal

00:02:41.410 --> 00:02:43.080 
energy I'm giving that long skinny pedal
that's<00:02:41.590> the<00:02:41.710> amount<00:02:41.920> of<00:02:41.980> tires<00:02:42.220> that<00:02:42.640> I'm

00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:43.090 
that's the amount of tires that I'm

00:02:43.090 --> 00:02:44.850 
that's the amount of tires that I'm
gonna<00:02:43.270> light<00:02:43.450> up<00:02:43.480> in<00:02:43.690> the<00:02:43.780> rear-end<00:02:44.140> I<00:02:44.320> you're

00:02:44.850 --> 00:02:44.860 
gonna light up in the rear-end I you're

00:02:44.860 --> 00:02:47.010 
gonna light up in the rear-end I you're
gonna<00:02:44.980> get<00:02:45.220> a<00:02:45.280> lot<00:02:45.460> of<00:02:45.580> tire<00:02:45.760> smoke<00:02:45.840> which<00:02:46.840> is<00:02:46.870> a

00:02:47.010 --> 00:02:47.020 
gonna get a lot of tire smoke which is a

00:02:47.020 --> 00:02:49.260 
gonna get a lot of tire smoke which is a
ton<00:02:47.260> of<00:02:47.290> fun<00:02:47.590> and<00:02:47.890> I'm<00:02:48.700> going<00:02:48.820> to<00:02:48.850> go<00:02:48.970> in<00:02:49.120> and

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:49.270 
ton of fun and I'm going to go in and

00:02:49.270 --> 00:02:59.090 
ton of fun and I'm going to go in and
initiate<00:02:49.540> a<00:02:49.780> slide<00:02:50.260> in<00:02:50.920> second<00:02:51.550> gear

00:02:59.090 --> 00:02:59.100

what<00:03:00.100> you're<00:03:00.220> doing<00:03:00.460> when<00:03:00.610> you're<00:03:00.700> drifting

00:03:00.960 --> 00:03:00.970 
what you're doing when you're drifting

00:03:00.970 --> 00:03:02.940 
what you're doing when you're drifting
is<00:03:01.270> you're<00:03:01.450> driving<00:03:01.780> past<00:03:02.050> the<00:03:02.320> envelope<00:03:02.800> of

00:03:02.940 --> 00:03:02.950 
is you're driving past the envelope of

00:03:02.950 --> 00:03:04.980 
is you're driving past the envelope of

00:03:04.980 --> 00:03:04.990 
the cars traction and the tires traction

00:03:04.990 --> 00:03:06.840 
the cars traction and the tires traction
trying<00:03:05.260> to<00:03:05.350> maintain<00:03:05.500> control<00:03:06.370> and<00:03:06.490> then

00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:06.850 
trying to maintain control and then

00:03:06.850 --> 00:03:09.150
