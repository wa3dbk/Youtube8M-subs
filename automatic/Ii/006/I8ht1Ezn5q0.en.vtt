helicopters<00:01:01.830> as<00:01:02.830> you<00:01:03.010> can<00:01:03.190> see<00:01:03.400> a<00:01:03.430> thick<00:01:04.030> black

00:01:04.410 --> 00:01:04.420

helicopters as you can see a thick black
smoke<00:01:04.449> above<00:01:05.110> JPL<00:01:05.740> and<00:01:06.130> the<00:01:06.580> fire<00:01:06.820> is<00:01:07.180> really

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:07.960 
smoke above JPL and the fire is really

00:01:07.960 --> 00:01:13.800 
smoke above JPL and the fire is really
going<00:01:10.890> and<00:01:11.890> we're<00:01:12.670> about<00:01:12.880> to<00:01:13.119> see<00:01:13.360> where<00:01:13.659> the

00:01:13.800 --> 00:01:13.810 
going and we're about to see where the

00:01:13.810 --> 00:01:23.250 
going and we're about to see where the
airplane<00:01:14.200> is<00:01:14.320> going<00:01:14.439> to<00:01:14.530> make<00:01:14.710> his<00:01:14.890> water<00:01:15.159> drop

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:23.260 

00:01:23.260 --> 00:01:25.830 

so<00:01:24.100> right<00:01:24.400> there<00:01:24.730> we<00:01:24.940> should<00:01:25.120> get<00:01:25.240> a<00:01:25.300> really

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:25.840 
so right there we should get a really

00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:29.460 
so right there we should get a really
good<00:01:26.080> clear<00:01:26.410> picture<00:01:26.440> of<00:01:26.890> it<00:01:27.480> and<00:01:28.480> here<00:01:29.230> comes
