work<00:00:35.489> basically<00:00:36.300> what<00:00:36.540> we're<00:00:36.690> trying<00:00:36.870> to<00:00:37.050> do

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:37.260 
work basically what we're trying to do

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:39.410 
work basically what we're trying to do
is<00:00:37.590> get<00:00:38.280> people<00:00:38.430> to<00:00:38.730> learn<00:00:38.910> how<00:00:39.090> to<00:00:39.120> control

their<00:00:39.780> own<00:00:39.809> brain<00:00:40.260> States<00:00:40.590> at<00:00:40.800> will<00:00:41.090> it's<00:00:42.090> very

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:42.360 
their own brain States at will it's very

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:44.660 
their own brain States at will it's very
similar<00:00:42.660> to<00:00:43.079> what<00:00:43.770> happens<00:00:44.160> when<00:00:44.370> you<00:00:44.460> go<00:00:44.610> to

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:44.670 
similar to what happens when you go to

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:46.190 
similar to what happens when you go to
the<00:00:44.879> beach<00:00:45.120> and<00:00:45.450> you're<00:00:45.690> listening<00:00:45.930> to<00:00:46.079> the

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:46.200 
the beach and you're listening to the

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:47.990 
the beach and you're listening to the
waves<00:00:46.350> and<00:00:46.530> you<00:00:46.649> become<00:00:46.920> very<00:00:47.070> very<00:00:47.309> relaxed

00:00:47.990 --> 00:00:48.000 
waves and you become very very relaxed

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:50.060 
waves and you become very very relaxed
or<00:00:48.149> when<00:00:48.809> you<00:00:48.899> go<00:00:49.050> to<00:00:49.079> a<00:00:49.230> symphony<00:00:49.559> and<00:00:49.860> you're

00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:50.070 
or when you go to a symphony and you're

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:53.299 
or when you go to a symphony and you're
moved<00:00:50.520> emotionally<00:00:51.210> by<00:00:51.360> that<00:00:51.570> music<00:00:52.309> you

00:00:53.299 --> 00:00:53.309 
moved emotionally by that music you

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:56.630 
moved emotionally by that music you
could<00:00:53.460> be<00:00:53.550> listening<00:00:53.820> to<00:00:54.660> the<00:00:55.379> sound<00:00:55.590> of<00:00:55.770> fire

00:00:56.630 --> 00:00:56.640 
could be listening to the sound of fire

00:00:56.640 --> 00:00:59.119 
could be listening to the sound of fire
or<00:00:57.149> crackling<00:00:58.140> wood<00:00:58.379> things<00:00:58.649> like<00:00:58.800> that<00:00:58.980> and

00:00:59.119 --> 00:00:59.129 
or crackling wood things like that and

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:00.319 
or crackling wood things like that and
you<00:00:59.190> get<00:00:59.340> that<00:00:59.520> that<00:00:59.760> that<00:00:59.910> sense<00:01:00.210> of

00:01:00.319 --> 00:01:00.329 
you get that that that sense of

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:01.430 
you get that that that sense of
relaxation<00:01:00.570> from<00:01:01.079> that

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:01.440 
relaxation from that

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:03.319 
relaxation from that

entrainment itself we need to go back to

00:02:04.979 --> 00:02:06.620 
entrainment itself we need to go back to
the<00:02:05.189> guy<00:02:05.310> who<00:02:05.369> coined<00:02:05.729> the<00:02:05.909> term<00:02:06.000> entrainment

00:02:06.620 --> 00:02:06.630 
the guy who coined the term entrainment

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:08.869 
the guy who coined the term entrainment
there<00:02:06.960> was<00:02:07.049> a<00:02:07.079> Dutch<00:02:07.489> mathematician<00:02:08.489> and

00:02:08.869 --> 00:02:08.879 
there was a Dutch mathematician and

00:02:08.879 --> 00:02:10.580 
there was a Dutch mathematician and
clocked<00:02:09.360> me<00:02:09.509> here<00:02:09.720> by<00:02:09.840> the<00:02:09.899> name<00:02:10.110> of<00:02:10.259> Christian

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:10.590

huge ins now Christian

00:02:12.990 --> 00:02:14.450 
huge ins now Christian
made<00:02:13.260> a<00:02:13.290> lot<00:02:13.560> of<00:02:13.590> clocks<00:02:13.950> and<00:02:14.100> whenever<00:02:14.310> you

00:02:14.450 --> 00:02:14.460 
made a lot of clocks and whenever you

00:02:14.460 --> 00:02:16.070 
made a lot of clocks and whenever you
would<00:02:14.550> take<00:02:14.760> a<00:02:14.790> new<00:02:15.000> pendulum<00:02:15.480> clock<00:02:15.750> and<00:02:15.960> put

00:02:16.070 --> 00:02:16.080 
would take a new pendulum clock and put

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:17.990 
would take a new pendulum clock and put
them<00:02:16.230> up<00:02:16.380> on<00:02:16.470> the<00:02:16.650> wall<00:02:16.830> he<00:02:17.580> would<00:02:17.730> notice

00:02:17.990 --> 00:02:18.000 
them up on the wall he would notice

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:19.670 
them up on the wall he would notice
after<00:02:18.150> a<00:02:18.300> certain<00:02:18.540> period<00:02:18.810> of<00:02:18.990> time<00:02:19.230> that<00:02:19.470> all

00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:19.680 
after a certain period of time that all

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:21.560 
after a certain period of time that all
the<00:02:19.860> clock<00:02:20.160> pendulums<00:02:20.850> would<00:02:21.030> start<00:02:21.270> swinging

00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:21.570 
the clock pendulums would start swinging

00:02:21.570 --> 00:02:23.720 
the clock pendulums would start swinging
in<00:02:21.840> unison<00:02:22.350> yeah<00:02:22.740> and<00:02:23.040> he<00:02:23.160> wasn't<00:02:23.310> sure<00:02:23.460> why

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:23.730 
in unison yeah and he wasn't sure why

00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:25.760 
in unison yeah and he wasn't sure why
this<00:02:23.790> happened<00:02:24.390> yes<00:02:24.570> to<00:02:25.170> make<00:02:25.320> a<00:02:25.350> long<00:02:25.620> story

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:25.770 
this happened yes to make a long story

00:02:25.770 --> 00:02:27.740 
this happened yes to make a long story
short<00:02:26.310> what<00:02:26.700> he<00:02:26.820> had<00:02:26.940> learned<00:02:27.240> was<00:02:27.480> that<00:02:27.510> there

00:02:27.740 --> 00:02:27.750 
short what he had learned was that there

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:30.080 
short what he had learned was that there
were<00:02:27.840> minor<00:02:28.170> variations<00:02:29.100> or<00:02:29.370> vibrations

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:30.090 
were minor variations or vibrations

00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:32.330 
were minor variations or vibrations

00:02:34.070 --> 00:02:34.080 
the other pendulums were sympathetically

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:36.290 
the other pendulums were sympathetically

00:03:32.540 --> 00:03:32.550 
you're actually getting into some of the

00:03:32.550 --> 00:03:34.490 
you're actually getting into some of the
background<00:03:33.060> thinking<00:03:33.420> that<00:03:33.570> occurs<00:03:33.840> without

00:03:34.490 --> 00:03:34.500 
background thinking that occurs without

00:03:34.500 --> 00:03:36.680 
background thinking that occurs without
your<00:03:34.860> own<00:03:34.950> attention<00:03:35.490> that<00:03:35.970> maybe<00:03:36.210> making<00:03:36.510> you

00:03:36.680 --> 00:03:36.690 
your own attention that maybe making you

00:03:36.690 --> 00:03:38.540 
your own attention that maybe making you
do<00:03:36.870> things<00:03:37.140> that<00:03:37.290> you<00:03:37.410> don't<00:03:37.620> like<00:03:37.800> doing<00:03:38.040> and

do things that you don't like doing and
in<00:03:38.970> that<00:03:39.120> way<00:03:39.210> you<00:03:39.270> can<00:03:39.360> recognize<00:03:39.840> them<00:03:40.170> and

00:03:40.340 --> 00:03:40.350 
in that way you can recognize them and

00:03:40.350 --> 00:03:42.410 
in that way you can recognize them and
change<00:03:40.590> them<00:03:40.800> for<00:03:40.980> the<00:03:41.010> better<00:03:41.100> and<00:03:42.090> now<00:03:42.270> is

change them for the better and now is

00:03:42.420 --> 00:03:44.090 
change them for the better and now is
