00:00:04.630 --> 00:00:09.560
 são paulo is among the largest metropolises in the world so the advantage in 

00:00:09.559 --> 00:00:13.090
 being a doctor there are also problems in the same proportion 

00:00:13.609 --> 00:00:19.099
 the city is one of the busiest is the main source of pollutants come from 

00:00:19.099 --> 00:00:22.910
 vehicles that fired Saudi the air pollution laboratory 

00:00:22.910 --> 00:00:29.070
 of usp he explains that the worst place is precisely with the great runners 

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:31.500
 exclusive buses and cars 

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:36.020
 are in the traffic corridor cet a correction average greater than it is 

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:39.800
 the average of the city ie the traffic hall and the chimney 

00:00:40.690 --> 00:00:46.120
 in the city pollution and speeding people's lives warned the 

00:00:46.120 --> 00:00:47.230
 researcher 

00:00:47.230 --> 00:00:51.870
 four thousand people a year lose their lives early in the city of são paulo 

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:55.100
 by pollution, I do not know the people themselves 

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:58.030
 is more than necessary this is more than the other 

00:00:58.030 --> 00:01:04.770
 classically is a partner of the club the solution in the medium term the city passes 

00:01:04.770 --> 00:01:06.420
 by a bus fleet 

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:07.790
 but neither 

00:01:07.790 --> 00:01:12.619
 of the 15 thousand buses that circulate through the streets of the city one thousand and two hundred 

00:01:12.619 --> 00:01:18.680
 begin to use as the new mixture a little slower the vehicles moved to 

00:01:18.679 --> 00:01:22.560
 biofuel are part of the so-called pedro confronta 

00:01:23.229 --> 00:01:26.919
 20% of biodiesel produced from cottonseed 

00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:30.500
 the midfielder Jack expected to conventional diesel 

00:01:31.220 --> 00:01:35.390
 this new mix that begins to be used in the buses of the city of 

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:39.770
 Sao Paulo can reduce pollutant emissions by up to 22% 

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:45.350
 the mixture mainly reduces to the emission of particulate material that 

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:50.110
 black smoke coming out of the exhausts portugal part of the group much more 

00:01:50.110 --> 00:01:52.120
 consistently the foundation's social 

00:01:52.120 --> 00:01:56.210
 with this chronic profile with reduction of life expectancy with the 

00:01:56.210 --> 00:01:59.100
 cancer better not remember anymore 

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:00.600
 so I think 

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:01.980
 and this is a good way 

00:02:01.980 --> 00:02:05.789
 it is a muscular problem one of the bus company drivers 

00:02:05.789 --> 00:02:10.079
 who participated in the pilot project who invested in the case of the new fuel 

00:02:10.079 --> 00:02:16.500
 for 19 years before the wheel in a short time realized the difference in relation 

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:20.269
 the old vehicles we realize that the 

00:02:20.269 --> 00:02:24.049
 the vehicles not only by the black smoke understood 

00:02:24.049 --> 00:02:26.579
 so same period 

00:02:26.579 --> 00:02:30.979
 we will understand that as - with environmental advice from the secretary 

00:02:30.979 --> 00:02:36.729
 transportation explains that the days I used in São Paulo already have a 

00:02:36.729 --> 00:02:40.209
 better quality because they contain less sulfur 

00:02:40.209 --> 00:02:44.950
 the mixture with the biodisel that now feeds revolted and says martyr 

00:02:44.950 --> 00:02:45.610
 quintino 

00:02:45.610 --> 00:02:50.870
 the first case you had on the same transformation path 

00:02:50.870 --> 00:02:56.220
 introducing the 50 ethanol-powered buses we are working on some 

00:02:56.220 --> 00:02:59.320
 research on diesel produced from sugarcane 

00:03:01.009 --> 00:03:03.000
 It's the vanguard as Saramago. 

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:05.309
 to test a hybrid bus 

00:03:05.309 --> 00:03:07.689
 I said I warn you too 

00:03:07.689 --> 00:03:10.469
 reduce them with smoke my mission 

00:03:10.469 --> 00:03:15.639
 all that until 2018 we can reach the established goal 

00:03:15.639 --> 00:03:20.329
 by the law of climate change of the municipality wanted to have the entire fleet and 

00:03:20.329 --> 00:03:23.759
 public transportation fueled by a fuel with the newbie 

00:03:25.389 --> 00:03:27.689
 right 

00:03:27.689 --> 00:03:29.229
 clever
