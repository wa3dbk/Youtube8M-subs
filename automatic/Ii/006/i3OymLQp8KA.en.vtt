00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:13.870
 hello to all good day to all we are to 

00:00:12.070 --> 00:00:15.519
 los angeles for call of duty 

00:00:13.870 --> 00:00:17.890
 championships once a year we come 

00:00:15.519 --> 00:00:19.119
 here to see his teams fight for 

00:00:17.890 --> 00:00:21.550
 a million dollars and I am 

00:00:19.119 --> 00:00:23.050
 now with a tcm gaming player 

00:00:21.550 --> 00:00:25.090
 the European team English team 

00:00:23.050 --> 00:00:25.390
 goetschy an iconic player of the 

00:00:25.090 --> 00:00:26.949
 scene 

00:00:25.390 --> 00:00:27.910
 unfortunately the tesserae do not have 

00:00:26.949 --> 00:00:30.010
 past the hens we go directly 

00:00:27.910 --> 00:00:32.129
 back on their course and on the 

00:00:30.010 --> 00:01:33.099
 disappointment we imagine will also be 

00:00:32.129 --> 00:01:34.119
 extent of san jose sharks has done very well 

00:01:33.099 --> 00:01:36.069
 so compared to the chicken phases 1 

00:01:34.119 --> 00:01:37.330
 it is really not walk on it 

00:01:36.069 --> 00:01:38.709
 tournament they do not really know what happened 

00:01:37.330 --> 00:01:40.090
 past they did not play as well as 

00:01:38.709 --> 00:01:41.920
 what they are unable to play they 

00:01:40.090 --> 00:01:43.390
 have come in this tournament very very con 

00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:45.039
 fiance saying that they were quite 

00:01:43.390 --> 00:01:46.300
 able even maybe to win the 

00:01:45.039 --> 00:01:47.470
 tournament online it was going very very 

00:01:46.300 --> 00:01:48.849
 well it's been ten days they're here 

00:01:47.470 --> 00:01:51.160
 they almost beat the optics in 

00:01:48.849 --> 00:01:52.810
 line and that's it was really very 

00:01:51.160 --> 00:01:54.130
 very close and then here in phases 

00:01:52.810 --> 00:01:55.479
 of hens they lost to facebook 

00:01:54.130 --> 00:01:56.470
 so they did not necessarily win 

00:01:55.479 --> 00:01:58.869
 this match and if both teams 

00:01:56.470 --> 00:02:00.160
 American but it was necessary 

00:01:58.869 --> 00:02:01.569
 put back and then behind his game account 

00:02:00.160 --> 00:02:03.910
 below zero and he thinks they have 

00:02:01.569 --> 00:02:05.800
 really underestimate the team of below 

00:02:03.910 --> 00:02:06.970
 zero it was that in the sun but 

00:02:05.800 --> 00:02:09.099
 he could not score the points 

00:02:06.970 --> 00:02:11.440
 in the lens so really very very 

00:02:09.099 --> 00:02:12.400
 disappointed danton so once again hurts 

00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:13.930
 is asked a question that what we have 

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:15.250
 posed to epic lane is that it is 

00:02:13.930 --> 00:02:16.570
 according to him the explanation for which 

00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:17.590
 the teams could European 

00:02:16.570 --> 00:02:20.100
 can not beat these teams 

00:02:17.590 --> 00:02:20.100
 US 

00:03:22.300 --> 00:03:26.540
 every year the European teams 

00:03:24.310 --> 00:03:27.770
 are totally dominate up to the said collar 

00:03:26.540 --> 00:03:29.720
 if you're young you're after the call of 

00:03:27.770 --> 00:03:30.650
 duty championships the Europeans get 

00:03:29.720 --> 00:03:31.760
 wake up and will win or at least 

00:03:30.650 --> 00:03:32.780
 do they are going to do a very good 

00:03:31.760 --> 00:03:34.760
 result in at least one tournament that's 

00:03:32.780 --> 00:03:35.840
 what happened before in the past there 

00:03:34.760 --> 00:03:37.190
 do not really know how it's done 

00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:37.970
 but he mainly thinks it's 

00:03:37.190 --> 00:03:39.500
 the fact that they have a lot more 

00:03:37.970 --> 00:03:40.670
 competitions in the united states so that's 

00:03:39.500 --> 00:03:41.390
 true that in europe there is there i ended ti who 

00:03:40.670 --> 00:03:43.160
 do a lot of things to try 

00:03:41.390 --> 00:03:44.900
 to help his mother the format 

00:03:43.160 --> 00:03:46.610
 is not really useful for example they 

00:03:44.900 --> 00:03:48.050
 are going to do tournaments where it's going 

00:03:46.610 --> 00:03:49.580
 start at six in the evening they go 

00:03:48.050 --> 00:03:51.290
 have to play until midnight they go 

00:03:49.580 --> 00:03:52.160
 play a single good team until the 

00:03:51.290 --> 00:03:53.720
 end 

00:03:52.160 --> 00:03:54.650
 and that's when they will arrive at 

00:03:53.720 --> 00:03:56.450
 play this good team they're going to be 

00:03:54.650 --> 00:03:58.640
 very tired so according to him needs to 

00:03:56.450 --> 00:04:00.080
 change that format a bit and 

00:03:58.640 --> 00:04:01.400
 especially this is the competition will not have 

00:04:00.080 --> 00:04:02.900
 need to become a better one for him 

00:04:01.400 --> 00:04:03.500
 there is a better training at the 

00:04:02.900 --> 00:04:05.390
 next question 

00:04:03.500 --> 00:04:06.440
 it's going to be obviously his 

00:04:05.390 --> 00:04:07.700
 predictions for his call of duty 

00:04:06.440 --> 00:04:08.990
 championships him he knows very 

00:04:07.700 --> 00:04:11.320
 very well the teams she would be 

00:04:08.990 --> 00:04:11.320
 without tobacco 

00:05:04.110 --> 00:05:08.230
 very well so for him he can not 

00:05:06.400 --> 00:05:09.700
 necessarily eliminate players from 

00:05:08.230 --> 00:05:11.290
 optical gaming because optics has 

00:05:09.700 --> 00:05:12.310
 really plays very very well since the 

00:05:11.290 --> 00:05:13.450
 beginning of the season they have three of 

00:05:12.310 --> 00:05:15.130
 most talented players on the game 

00:05:13.450 --> 00:05:16.060
 neither very good cat very good captain of this 

00:05:15.130 --> 00:05:17.170
 team but for now it's 

00:05:16.060 --> 00:05:18.550
 difficult to see they are in the process of 

00:05:17.170 --> 00:05:20.020
 play against the flames is behind 

00:05:18.550 --> 00:05:21.460
 we are in loser bracket on va 

00:05:20.020 --> 00:05:23.410
 have to do something very, very 

00:05:21.460 --> 00:05:24.730
 special to successfully beat the ddt and 

00:05:23.410 --> 00:05:25.990
 niall disdained one who eliminated them 

00:05:24.730 --> 00:05:27.160
 that they are very very strong so they 

00:05:25.990 --> 00:05:29.260
 would see many niall behind 

00:05:27.160 --> 00:05:30.490
 optical and why not behind tim 

00:05:29.260 --> 00:05:32.380
 revenge that is a very very good 

00:05:30.490 --> 00:05:33.880
 team with a very big team work according 

00:05:32.380 --> 00:05:35.140
 him the last question I was asked 

00:05:33.880 --> 00:05:37.390
 at gkn jc who had a very event 

00:05:35.140 --> 00:05:39.460
 special at tcm gaming it's the purchase 

00:05:37.390 --> 00:05:41.770
 a spot in league 

00:05:39.460 --> 00:05:42.730
 ml i have so they will come live at 

00:05:41.770 --> 00:05:44.380
 united states for three months to do 

00:05:42.730 --> 00:05:45.700
 this league and we will try time a 

00:05:44.380 --> 00:05:46.720
 little bit what are their goals and 

00:05:45.700 --> 00:05:47.620
 what is the strategy behind that is 

00:05:46.720 --> 00:05:55.419
 what they intend to do by 

00:05:47.620 --> 00:06:40.030
 example of the mlg of the Americas 

00:05:55.419 --> 00:06:41.770
 sow is fine so the strategy to 

00:06:40.030 --> 00:06:43.240
 It's obviously trying to 

00:06:41.770 --> 00:06:45.250
 progress as a player but also 

00:06:43.240 --> 00:06:46.660
 to advance their brands the 

00:06:45.250 --> 00:06:47.860
 mark tcm that is to say that they will 

00:06:46.660 --> 00:06:49.360
 really oustry but it's something 

00:06:47.860 --> 00:06:50.590
 who was not at all before so they 

00:06:49.360 --> 00:06:53.500
 are really going to try to come here and 

00:06:50.590 --> 00:06:55.030
 to create a future with that's all 

00:06:53.500 --> 00:06:57.280
 all the everything that is put to 

00:06:55.030 --> 00:06:58.300
 provision aside cm trying to do 

00:06:57.280 --> 00:07:00.970
 the best performances online 

00:06:58.300 --> 00:07:02.140
 as well as of course they 

00:07:00.970 --> 00:07:04.240
 finish top 8 they will try to get 

00:07:02.140 --> 00:07:04.710
 qualify for the x games mlg so that 

00:07:04.240 --> 00:07:06.930
 it really is 

00:07:04.710 --> 00:07:08.070
 their goal and it's very very hard to 

00:07:06.930 --> 00:07:09.330
 predict for the moment where they will end 

00:07:08.070 --> 00:07:11.610
 they will just try to play at best 

00:07:09.330 --> 00:07:16.970
 and progress we will let him 

00:07:11.610 --> 00:07:16.970
