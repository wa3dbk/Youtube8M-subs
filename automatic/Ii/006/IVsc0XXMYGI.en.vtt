00:00:00.700 --> 00:00:06.609
 some here 21 with the crossbow of 

00:00:04.480 --> 00:00:10.550
 I am the worst thing that exists in the world but 

00:00:06.609 --> 00:00:13.550
 come on if you look at it 

00:00:10.550 --> 00:00:13.550
 one 

00:00:16.100 --> 00:00:21.660
 It is clear is 

00:00:19.340 --> 00:00:24.380
 slashed bodies bodies there 

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:24.380
 another and another 

00:00:24.620 --> 00:00:29.980
 and look where it is so they have ax 

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:33.340
 I think you call me I remember 

00:00:29.980 --> 00:00:35.350
 and left already the points go with the bank not 

00:00:33.340 --> 00:00:38.489
 I know what works best with the star itself 

00:00:35.350 --> 00:00:38.489
 but you're running out of arrow 

00:00:38.860 --> 00:00:43.520
 the knife says that and with the knife 

00:00:42.230 --> 00:00:45.600
 but it will be finished, you're running out of 

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:48.530
 knives 

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:48.530
 look, look, look 

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:59.629
 the ax 

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:59.629
 close is that they are many 

00:01:04.620 --> 00:01:08.540
 I'm sure it happens now 

00:01:14.260 --> 00:01:19.810
 this asset that happens here to calm in 

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:19.810
 I crack my ear 

00:01:21.580 --> 00:01:24.270
 look look 

00:01:24.310 --> 00:01:28.560
 with this aesthetic of an ax 

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:33.570
 not now 

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:37.110
 do not 

00:01:37.610 --> 00:01:46.120
 you who your bankruptcy and is another 

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:50.650
 once the vega 

00:01:46.120 --> 00:01:54.750
 of skin reason but now we are not going to 

00:01:50.650 --> 00:01:54.750
 hit arrow for pension 

00:01:56.970 --> 00:02:02.810
 and this fear 

00:02:00.120 --> 00:02:02.810
 and he goes 

00:02:02.980 --> 00:02:05.940
 look at the form 

00:02:08.950 --> 00:02:14.010
 I passed it that is in the response if 

00:02:11.620 --> 00:02:14.010
 has one hour 

00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:26.870
 m 

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:26.870
 from behind another come is in all 

00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:32.480
 where I mean they are all 

00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:32.480
 restarting 

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:40.180
 looking if he keeps pulling with the shot with 

00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:43.030
 the East 

00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:46.409
 we will reduce the son of a bitch ax 

00:02:43.030 --> 00:02:46.409
 declare the crossbow 

00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:56.040
 again beaten if you have me right 

00:02:52.930 --> 00:02:56.040
 this color is a little good 

00:02:58.030 --> 00:03:00.959
 in this 

00:03:04.909 --> 00:03:09.440
 the son of a bitch pig 

00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:16.810
 tomÃ¡s 

00:03:09.440 --> 00:03:16.810
 but but it is good that I had to leave 

00:03:17.270 --> 00:03:21.100
 but you were there he's going to take away but 

00:03:18.920 --> 00:03:24.870
 after this one 

00:03:21.100 --> 00:03:28.530
 and think that rather pulled and he 

00:03:24.870 --> 00:03:31.840
 the ax of the eggs to the people there 

00:03:28.530 --> 00:03:34.000
 what to support 

00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:35.880
 alpha s 

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:41.460
 if the facts there is one around here it seems to me 

00:03:35.880 --> 00:03:41.460
 look for you 

00:03:42.210 --> 00:03:45.450
 really an ax 

00:03:47.380 --> 00:03:55.490
 a bottom step of the that but fine 

00:03:50.530 --> 00:03:58.040
 because I wanted to get rid of the pigs, birds 

00:03:55.490 --> 00:04:01.070
 I'm losing what I think is going 

00:03:58.040 --> 00:04:03.430
 I won, he wins, he killed me, he takes 

00:04:01.070 --> 00:04:03.430
 list 

00:04:03.490 --> 00:04:07.470
 to the base you restart again 

00:04:07.590 --> 00:04:11.760
 must have a low point each one that 

00:04:09.989 --> 00:04:13.530
 hallucinate colors to see I have two 

00:04:11.760 --> 00:04:15.730
 works that now on top of that 

00:04:13.530 --> 00:04:20.209
 close to the breaking 

00:04:15.730 --> 00:04:23.169
 where is one and failed the two guys 

00:04:20.209 --> 00:04:23.169
 I'm going to take it 

00:04:26.250 --> 00:04:34.210
 also another because he was missing below that 

00:04:31.930 --> 00:04:37.860
 I do not say it at all take now in all 

00:04:34.210 --> 00:04:41.960
 the bloody kid head 

00:04:37.860 --> 00:04:41.960
 here look look 

00:04:42.169 --> 00:04:45.879
 bankruptcy wait with win 

00:04:48.379 --> 00:04:52.219
 I have 105 

00:04:52.339 --> 00:04:56.300
 no no no no no no no 

00:04:57.680 --> 00:05:03.450
 notimex 

00:05:00.660 --> 00:05:07.140
 What anger for who is gaining time is going 

00:05:03.450 --> 00:05:11.060
 gaining work the parable is uncle 

00:05:07.140 --> 00:05:11.060
 I'm second to reality 

00:05:14.520 --> 00:05:17.970
 five times I
