00:00:03.590 --> 00:00:03.600 
now that we have an audio let's add some

00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:06.200 
now that we have an audio let's add some
animations<00:00:04.380> in<00:00:04.470> our<00:00:04.620> project<00:00:05.029> let's<00:00:06.029> start

00:00:06.200 --> 00:00:06.210 
animations in our project let's start

00:00:06.210 --> 00:00:10.550 
animations in our project let's start
and<00:00:06.689> made<00:00:07.200> the<00:00:07.380> Sun<00:00:07.940> in<00:00:08.940> order<00:00:09.150> to<00:00:09.270> do<00:00:09.420> so<00:00:09.560> click

00:00:10.550 --> 00:00:10.560 
and made the Sun in order to do so click

00:00:10.560 --> 00:00:14.770 
and made the Sun in order to do so click
the<00:00:10.860> layer<00:00:11.040> sign<00:00:11.400> and<00:00:12.290> click<00:00:13.290> add<00:00:13.470> animation

the<00:00:15.780> animation<00:00:16.230> window<00:00:16.379> appears<00:00:16.999> here<00:00:17.999> you

00:00:18.109 --> 00:00:18.119 
the animation window appears here you

00:00:18.119 --> 00:00:20.089 
the animation window appears here you
can<00:00:18.269> name<00:00:18.449> your<00:00:18.480> animation<00:00:19.259> or<00:00:19.740> even<00:00:20.070> just

00:00:20.089 --> 00:00:20.099 
can name your animation or even just

00:00:20.099 --> 00:00:22.809 
can name your animation or even just
accept<00:00:20.699> the<00:00:20.789> name<00:00:21.060> it<00:00:21.179> proposed<00:00:21.509> by<00:00:21.749> quick<00:00:22.019> and

00:00:22.809 --> 00:00:22.819 
accept the name it proposed by quick and

00:00:22.819 --> 00:00:26.569 
accept the name it proposed by quick and
select<00:00:23.819> the<00:00:23.970> type<00:00:24.859> for<00:00:25.859> this<00:00:26.009> first<00:00:26.189> animation

00:00:26.569 --> 00:00:26.579 
select the type for this first animation

00:00:26.579 --> 00:00:29.659 
select the type for this first animation
let's<00:00:26.880> use<00:00:27.089> linear<00:00:27.619> the<00:00:28.619> keyframe<00:00:28.980> info<00:00:29.369> show

00:00:29.659 --> 00:00:29.669 
let's use linear the keyframe info show

00:00:29.669 --> 00:00:31.990 
let's use linear the keyframe info show
us<00:00:29.849> the<00:00:30.089> current<00:00:30.749> position<00:00:31.199> of<00:00:31.319> the<00:00:31.499> Sun

00:00:31.990 --> 00:00:32.000 
us the current position of the Sun

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:35.150 
us the current position of the Sun
anytime<00:00:33.000> you<00:00:33.149> move<00:00:33.329> in<00:00:33.690> quick<00:00:34.530> automatically

00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:35.160 
anytime you move in quick automatically

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:37.700 
anytime you move in quick automatically
we'll<00:00:35.340> save<00:00:35.609> that<00:00:35.879> but<00:00:36.870> the<00:00:36.989> most<00:00:37.140> important

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:37.710 
we'll save that but the most important

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:41.029 
we'll save that but the most important
thing<00:00:37.769> here<00:00:37.920> is<00:00:38.510> the<00:00:39.510> end<00:00:39.719> position<00:00:40.350> as<00:00:40.530> it<00:00:40.829> is

00:00:41.029 --> 00:00:41.039 
thing here is the end position as it is

00:00:41.039 --> 00:00:44.869 
thing here is the end position as it is
a<00:00:41.070> linear<00:00:41.910> animation<00:00:42.690> so<00:00:43.530> let's<00:00:44.160> move<00:00:44.399> the<00:00:44.609> Sun

00:00:44.869 --> 00:00:44.879 
a linear animation so let's move the Sun

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:50.509 
a linear animation so let's move the Sun
a<00:00:45.090> little<00:00:45.690> bit<00:00:45.809> higher<00:00:48.260> you<00:00:49.260> can<00:00:49.410> do<00:00:49.589> so<00:00:49.890> for

00:00:50.509 --> 00:00:50.519 
a little bit higher you can do so for

00:00:50.519 --> 00:00:54.259 
a little bit higher you can do so for
example<00:00:50.629> just<00:00:52.039> moving<00:00:53.039> this<00:00:53.249> line<00:00:53.609> the<00:00:54.030> wise

00:00:54.259 --> 00:00:54.269 
example just moving this line the wise

00:00:54.269 --> 00:00:58.340 
example just moving this line the wise
line<00:00:56.149> meaning<00:00:57.149> that<00:00:57.390> the<00:00:57.539> Sun<00:00:57.809> is<00:00:57.839> a<00:00:58.050> little

00:00:58.340 --> 00:00:58.350 
line meaning that the Sun is a little

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:02.029 
line meaning that the Sun is a little
bit<00:00:58.489> higher<00:00:59.489> now<00:00:59.929> let's<00:01:00.929> move<00:01:01.140> the<00:01:01.379> sound<00:01:01.679> so

00:01:02.029 --> 00:01:02.039 
bit higher now let's move the sound so

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:06.650 
bit higher now let's move the sound so
close<00:01:02.539> to<00:01:03.539> the<00:01:03.809> Africa<00:01:04.589> name<00:01:05.430> that's<00:01:06.360> fine

00:01:06.650 --> 00:01:06.660 
close to the Africa name that's fine

00:01:06.660 --> 00:01:09.560 
close to the Africa name that's fine
here<00:01:07.340> you<00:01:08.340> could<00:01:08.550> also<00:01:08.730> do<00:01:09.000> that<00:01:09.150> just

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:09.570 
here you could also do that just

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:13.130 
here you could also do that just
entering<00:01:10.020> numbers<00:01:10.410> here<00:01:11.630> the<00:01:12.630> return<00:01:12.990> to

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:13.140 
entering numbers here the return to

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:15.980 
entering numbers here the return to
start<00:01:13.440> position<00:01:13.950> after<00:01:14.070> play<00:01:14.930> should<00:01:15.930> be

00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:15.990 
start position after play should be

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:18.260 
start position after play should be
using<00:01:16.440> any<00:01:16.560> time<00:01:16.920> that<00:01:17.100> you<00:01:17.250> decide<00:01:17.730> to<00:01:18.000> have

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:18.270 
using any time that you decide to have

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:21.170 
using any time that you decide to have
the<00:01:18.720> current<00:01:19.260> layer<00:01:19.790> returned<00:01:20.790> to<00:01:21.000> its

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:21.180 
the current layer returned to its

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:24.740 
the current layer returned to its
previous<00:01:22.250> position<00:01:23.250> it's<00:01:23.940> not<00:01:24.150> the<00:01:24.300> case<00:01:24.510> for

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:24.750 
previous position it's not the case for

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:29.360 
previous position it's not the case for
the<00:01:24.870> Sun<00:01:25.110> so<00:01:25.860> let's<00:01:26.190> uncheck<00:01:26.940> it<00:01:28.040> the<00:01:29.040> Alpha

00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:29.370 
the Sun so let's uncheck it the Alpha

00:01:29.370 --> 00:01:31.490 
the Sun so let's uncheck it the Alpha
again<00:01:29.730> is<00:01:29.940> just<00:01:30.240> for<00:01:30.450> the<00:01:30.540> end<00:01:30.690> position<00:01:31.260> so

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:31.500 
again is just for the end position so

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:33.560 
again is just for the end position so
let's<00:01:31.740> keep<00:01:31.980> it<00:01:32.190> as<00:01:32.460> a<00:01:32.520> hundred<00:01:32.970> percent<00:01:33.150> as

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:33.570 
let's keep it as a hundred percent as

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:37.880 
let's keep it as a hundred percent as
the<00:01:33.810> Sun<00:01:34.080> will<00:01:34.320> always<00:01:34.710> be<00:01:35.090> showing<00:01:36.090> up<00:01:36.890> the

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:37.890 
the Sun will always be showing up the

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:41.090 
the Sun will always be showing up the
duration<00:01:38.430> is<00:01:38.580> the<00:01:39.000> time<00:01:39.270> from<00:01:39.810> the<00:01:40.410> start<00:01:40.800> to

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:41.100 
duration is the time from the start to

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:43.520 
duration is the time from the start to
the<00:01:41.130> end<00:01:41.280> position<00:01:42.090> so<00:01:42.630> let's<00:01:42.840> say<00:01:43.080> the<00:01:43.260> Sun

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:43.530 
the end position so let's say the Sun

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:45.170 
the end position so let's say the Sun
will<00:01:43.770> move<00:01:44.010> up<00:01:44.250> from<00:01:44.550> the<00:01:44.640> original<00:01:45.030> position

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:45.180 
will move up from the original position

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:53.080 
will move up from the original position
to<00:01:46.050> the<00:01:46.230> end<00:01:46.520> one<00:01:47.520> in<00:01:48.150> three<00:01:48.600> seconds<00:01:51.230> starts

00:01:53.080 --> 00:01:53.090 
to the end one in three seconds starts

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:55.940 
to the end one in three seconds starts
helps<00:01:54.090> you<00:01:54.270> to<00:01:54.600> define<00:01:55.020> if<00:01:55.290> the<00:01:55.500> animation

00:01:55.940 --> 00:01:55.950 
helps you to define if the animation

00:01:55.950 --> 00:01:58.010 
helps you to define if the animation
will<00:01:56.040> play<00:01:56.310> as<00:01:56.490> soon<00:01:56.730> as<00:01:56.850> you<00:01:57.150> start<00:01:57.660> the<00:01:57.810> movie

00:01:58.010 --> 00:01:58.020 
will play as soon as you start the movie

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:01.880 
will play as soon as you start the movie
or<00:01:58.400> if<00:01:59.400> it<00:01:59.610> will<00:01:59.820> need<00:02:00.060> to<00:02:00.300> wait<00:02:01.290> until<00:02:01.590> a

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:01.890 
or if it will need to wait until a

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:05.030 
or if it will need to wait until a
button<00:02:02.370> start<00:02:02.880> set<00:02:03.180> in<00:02:03.330> this<00:02:04.170> case<00:02:04.440> let's<00:02:04.740> just

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:05.040 
button start set in this case let's just

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:08.839 
button start set in this case let's just
accept<00:02:05.550> the<00:02:05.700> wind<00:02:06.090> page<00:02:06.360> start<00:02:07.550> the<00:02:08.550> delay

00:02:08.839 --> 00:02:08.849 
accept the wind page start the delay

00:02:08.849 --> 00:02:12.110 
accept the wind page start the delay
also<00:02:09.300> tells<00:02:09.929> quick<00:02:10.229> to<00:02:10.649> wait<00:02:11.310> a<00:02:11.340> little<00:02:11.550> bit<00:02:11.820> a

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:12.120 
also tells quick to wait a little bit a

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:14.660 
also tells quick to wait a little bit a
few<00:02:12.660> seconds<00:02:13.080> before<00:02:13.410> to<00:02:13.860> start<00:02:14.160> the<00:02:14.250> enemy

00:02:14.660 --> 00:02:14.670 
few seconds before to start the enemy

00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:17.480 
few seconds before to start the enemy
or<00:02:15.000> just<00:02:15.569> started<00:02:16.290> as<00:02:16.500> soon<00:02:16.770> as<00:02:17.010> they<00:02:17.160> the

00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:17.490 
or just started as soon as they the

00:02:17.490 --> 00:02:19.790 
or just started as soon as they the
movie<00:02:18.120> starts<00:02:18.510> let's<00:02:18.840> let's<00:02:19.230> wait<00:02:19.500> two

00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:19.800 
movie starts let's let's wait two

00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:25.729 
movie starts let's let's wait two
seconds<00:02:21.290> with<00:02:22.290> that<00:02:22.500> let's<00:02:23.280> create<00:02:23.580> as<00:02:24.739> you

00:02:25.729 --> 00:02:25.739 
seconds with that let's create as you

00:02:25.739 --> 00:02:29.030 
seconds with that let's create as you
can<00:02:25.890> see<00:02:26.099> here<00:02:26.489> the<00:02:27.060> animation<00:02:27.569> son<00:02:27.900> is<00:02:28.530> a<00:02:28.560> rat

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:29.040 
can see here the animation son is a rat

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:33.170 
can see here the animation son is a rat
in<00:02:29.220> the<00:02:29.310> project<00:02:29.760> and<00:02:30.230> the<00:02:31.230> Sun<00:02:31.500> came<00:02:31.709> back<00:02:32.400> to

00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:33.180 
in the project and the Sun came back to

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:35.840 
in the project and the Sun came back to
its<00:02:33.450> original<00:02:33.630> position<00:02:33.959> and<00:02:34.640> as<00:02:35.640> I<00:02:35.670> mentioned

00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:35.850 
its original position and as I mentioned

00:02:35.850 --> 00:02:39.400 
its original position and as I mentioned
you<00:02:36.390> can<00:02:36.450> even<00:02:36.870> say<00:02:37.280> let's<00:02:38.280> start<00:02:38.790> the<00:02:38.940> Sun

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:39.410 
you can even say let's start the Sun

00:02:39.410 --> 00:02:46.630 
you can even say let's start the Sun
here<00:02:40.410> and<00:02:41.239> move<00:02:42.239> it<00:02:42.600> from<00:02:43.230> the<00:02:44.160> back<00:02:44.430> of<00:02:44.730> the

00:02:46.630 --> 00:02:46.640 
here and move it from the back of the

00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:55.430 
here and move it from the back of the
planes<00:02:47.640> for<00:02:48.030> example<00:02:50.569> so<00:02:52.160> one<00:02:53.160> more<00:02:54.350> here<00:02:55.350> we

00:02:55.430 --> 00:02:55.440 
planes for example so one more here we

00:02:55.440 --> 00:02:58.400 
planes for example so one more here we
go<00:02:55.700> quick<00:02:56.700> knows<00:02:56.970> that<00:02:57.269> although<00:02:57.750> we<00:02:57.989> change

00:02:58.400 --> 00:02:58.410 
go quick knows that although we change

00:02:58.410 --> 00:03:01.009 
go quick knows that although we change
the<00:02:58.590> original<00:02:58.739> position<00:02:59.100> of<00:02:59.459> the<00:02:59.610> Sun<00:02:59.880> the<00:03:00.840> end

00:03:01.009 --> 00:03:01.019 
the original position of the Sun the end

00:03:01.019 --> 00:03:04.309 
the original position of the Sun the end
position<00:03:01.620> is<00:03:01.799> the<00:03:02.220> one<00:03:02.430> save<00:03:03.290> anytime<00:03:04.290> that

00:03:04.309 --> 00:03:04.319 
position is the one save anytime that

00:03:04.319 --> 00:03:07.430 
position is the one save anytime that
you<00:03:04.590> decide<00:03:04.980> to<00:03:05.569> review<00:03:06.569> your<00:03:06.600> animation<00:03:07.319> you

00:03:07.430 --> 00:03:07.440 
you decide to review your animation you

00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:09.320 
you decide to review your animation you
don't<00:03:07.650> need<00:03:07.739> to<00:03:07.920> create<00:03:08.100> it<00:03:08.250> again<00:03:08.549> just

00:03:09.320 --> 00:03:09.330 
don't need to create it again just

00:03:09.330 --> 00:03:12.710 
don't need to create it again just
double<00:03:10.140> click<00:03:10.380> and<00:03:11.299> you'll<00:03:12.299> see<00:03:12.480> everything

00:03:12.710 --> 00:03:12.720 
double click and you'll see everything

00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:19.880 
double click and you'll see everything
here<00:03:14.810> the<00:03:15.810> next<00:03:15.959> animation<00:03:16.410> is<00:03:17.720> the<00:03:18.720> cloth<00:03:18.989> so

00:03:19.880 --> 00:03:19.890 
here the next animation is the cloth so

00:03:19.890 --> 00:03:23.050 
here the next animation is the cloth so
let's<00:03:20.160> click<00:03:20.459> the<00:03:20.700> cloud<00:03:20.940> here<00:03:21.480> and<00:03:21.660> let's<00:03:22.500> say

00:03:23.050 --> 00:03:23.060 
let's click the cloud here and let's say

00:03:23.060 --> 00:03:27.050 
let's click the cloud here and let's say
let's<00:03:24.060> animate<00:03:24.780> the<00:03:25.079> cloud<00:03:25.430> we<00:03:26.430> will<00:03:26.640> still

00:03:27.050 --> 00:03:27.060 
let's animate the cloud we will still

00:03:27.060 --> 00:03:29.750 
let's animate the cloud we will still
use<00:03:27.269> the<00:03:27.690> linear<00:03:27.870> here<00:03:28.680> but<00:03:29.370> the<00:03:29.519> only<00:03:29.670> thing

00:03:29.750 --> 00:03:29.760 
use the linear here but the only thing

00:03:29.760 --> 00:03:31.970 
use the linear here but the only thing
that<00:03:30.120> we<00:03:30.299> are<00:03:30.359> going<00:03:30.540> to<00:03:30.630> do<00:03:30.780> now<00:03:30.989> is<00:03:31.260> to<00:03:31.709> move

00:03:31.970 --> 00:03:31.980 
that we are going to do now is to move

00:03:31.980 --> 00:03:36.009 
that we are going to do now is to move
the<00:03:32.040> x<00:03:32.790> position<00:03:33.480> the<00:03:34.230> cloud<00:03:34.500> 2<00:03:34.950> off-screen

00:03:36.009 --> 00:03:36.019 
the x position the cloud 2 off-screen

00:03:36.019 --> 00:03:40.460 
the x position the cloud 2 off-screen
meaning<00:03:37.019> that<00:03:37.200> again<00:03:37.799> the<00:03:38.100> cloud<00:03:38.340> will<00:03:39.470> cross

00:03:40.460 --> 00:03:40.470 
meaning that again the cloud will cross

00:03:40.470 --> 00:03:44.449 
meaning that again the cloud will cross
the<00:03:40.859> screen<00:03:41.780> in<00:03:42.780> this<00:03:43.019> case<00:03:43.290> we<00:03:43.709> want<00:03:44.040> to<00:03:44.160> the

00:03:44.449 --> 00:03:44.459 
the screen in this case we want to the

00:03:44.459 --> 00:03:46.370 
the screen in this case we want to the
cloud<00:03:44.940> to<00:03:45.180> return<00:03:45.570> to<00:03:45.750> its<00:03:45.900> original<00:03:46.019> position

00:03:46.370 --> 00:03:46.380 
cloud to return to its original position

00:03:46.380 --> 00:03:49.069 
cloud to return to its original position
when<00:03:47.370> the<00:03:47.400> animation<00:03:47.940> finished<00:03:48.329> so<00:03:48.660> you're

00:03:49.069 --> 00:03:49.079 
when the animation finished so you're

00:03:49.079 --> 00:03:52.759 
when the animation finished so you're
going<00:03:49.230> to<00:03:49.320> leave<00:03:49.530> this<00:03:49.799> check<00:03:50.549> here<00:03:51.290> also<00:03:52.290> the

00:03:52.759 --> 00:03:52.769 
going to leave this check here also the

00:03:52.769 --> 00:03:55.789 
going to leave this check here also the
duration<00:03:53.220> is<00:03:53.370> going<00:03:53.640> to<00:03:53.700> be<00:03:53.959> 10<00:03:54.959> seconds<00:03:55.530> it's

00:03:55.789 --> 00:03:55.799 
duration is going to be 10 seconds it's

00:03:55.799 --> 00:03:58.220 
duration is going to be 10 seconds it's
going<00:03:56.010> to<00:03:56.070> be<00:03:56.220> a<00:03:56.250> slow<00:03:56.760> move<00:03:57.510> across<00:03:57.959> the

00:03:58.220 --> 00:03:58.230 
going to be a slow move across the

00:03:58.230 --> 00:04:01.130 
going to be a slow move across the
screen<00:03:58.440> and<00:03:58.730> at<00:03:59.730> this<00:03:59.910> time<00:03:59.970> we<00:04:00.780> are<00:04:00.870> going<00:04:00.900> to

00:04:01.130 --> 00:04:01.140 
screen and at this time we are going to

00:04:01.140 --> 00:04:04.789 
screen and at this time we are going to
use<00:04:01.170> the<00:04:01.560> weight<00:04:01.799> request<00:04:03.200> again<00:04:04.200> when<00:04:04.769> a

00:04:04.789 --> 00:04:04.799 
use the weight request again when a

00:04:04.799 --> 00:04:06.440 
use the weight request again when a
movie<00:04:05.010> star<00:04:05.430> nothing's<00:04:06.150> going<00:04:06.359> to<00:04:06.390> happen

movie star nothing's going to happen
with<00:04:06.810> the<00:04:06.900> cloud<00:04:07.140> it<00:04:07.799> will<00:04:08.069> be<00:04:08.220> there<00:04:08.519> until

00:04:09.229 --> 00:04:09.239 
with the cloud it will be there until

00:04:09.239 --> 00:04:11.920 
with the cloud it will be there until
something<00:04:09.900> happens<00:04:10.319> we<00:04:10.680> are<00:04:10.769> going<00:04:10.950> to<00:04:11.010> tell<00:04:11.220> a
