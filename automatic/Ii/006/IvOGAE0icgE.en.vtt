6<00:02:33.340> 7<00:02:35.459> 8<00:02:36.459> 9<00:02:37.620> 10<00:02:39.810> 11<00:02:43.739> but<00:02:44.739> as<00:02:44.920> you<00:02:45.070> can<00:02:45.160> see<00:02:45.340> you're

00:02:45.479 --> 00:02:45.489 
6 7 8 9 10 11 but as you can see you're

00:02:45.489 --> 00:02:48.420 
6 7 8 9 10 11 but as you can see you're
letting<00:02:45.790> it<00:02:45.940> to<00:02:46.030> 13<00:02:46.570> that<00:02:47.500> I<00:02:47.530> still<00:02:47.920> shot<00:02:48.160> more

00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:48.430 
letting it to 13 that I still shot more

00:02:48.430 --> 00:02:50.850 
letting it to 13 that I still shot more
than<00:02:48.459> 8<00:02:48.760> which<00:02:49.120> is<00:02:49.150> the<00:02:49.450> maximum<00:02:49.660> capacity<00:02:50.230> of

00:02:50.850 --> 00:02:50.860 
than 8 which is the maximum capacity of

00:02:50.860 --> 00:02:54.150 
than 8 which is the maximum capacity of
the<00:02:50.950> shotgun<00:02:51.840> so<00:02:52.840> now<00:02:53.320> at<00:02:53.500> least<00:02:53.680> I<00:02:53.800> can<00:02:53.950> prove
