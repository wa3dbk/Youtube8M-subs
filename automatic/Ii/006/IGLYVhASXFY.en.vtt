00:00:07.820 --> 00:00:07.830 
shockwave repaint here is in tank mode

00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:09.830 
shockwave repaint here is in tank mode
and<00:00:08.099> again<00:00:08.700> in<00:00:08.849> tank<00:00:09.059> mode<00:00:09.240> as<00:00:09.389> I<00:00:09.480> mention<00:00:09.750> my

and again in tank mode as I mention my
other<00:00:09.960> review<00:00:10.139> I<00:00:10.170> think<00:00:10.260> he<00:00:10.469> looks<00:00:10.620> a<00:00:10.710> lot

00:00:10.850 --> 00:00:10.860

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:13.660 
other review I think he looks a lot
better<00:00:11.040> with<00:00:11.429> the<00:00:12.150> cannon<00:00:12.570> facing<00:00:12.900> backwards

00:00:13.660 --> 00:00:13.670 
better with the cannon facing backwards

00:00:13.670 --> 00:00:16.970 
better with the cannon facing backwards
technically<00:00:14.670> from<00:00:14.910> the<00:00:15.089> thing<00:00:15.570> so<00:00:15.929> that's<00:00:16.710> how

00:00:16.970 --> 00:00:16.980 
technically from the thing so that's how

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:21.050 
technically from the thing so that's how
I<00:00:17.010> display<00:00:17.400> him<00:00:19.460> but<00:00:20.460> he's<00:00:20.580> the<00:00:20.640> same<00:00:20.820> figure

00:00:21.050 --> 00:00:21.060 
I display him but he's the same figure

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:37.950 
the kind of baiji white that long-arm

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:42.590 
the kind of baiji white that long-arm
had<00:00:39.680> so<00:00:40.680> I<00:00:41.040> always<00:00:41.520> got<00:00:41.790> the<00:00:41.940> new<00:00:42.210> flip<00:00:42.450> out

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:42.600 
had so I always got the new flip out

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:45.250 
had so I always got the new flip out
guns<00:00:42.870> here<00:00:43.290> and<00:00:43.530> then<00:00:43.739> the<00:00:43.890> turret<00:00:44.190> rotates

00:00:45.250 --> 00:00:45.260 
guns here and then the turret rotates

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:48.380 
guns here and then the turret rotates
any<00:00:46.260> rolls<00:00:46.469> but<00:00:46.890> I'm<00:00:47.460> not<00:00:47.610> gonna<00:00:47.760> focus<00:00:48.000> too

00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:48.390 
any rolls but I'm not gonna focus too

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:51.439 
any rolls but I'm not gonna focus too
too<00:00:48.539> much<00:00:48.750> on<00:00:49.760> features<00:00:50.760> since<00:00:51.090> I've<00:00:51.210> already

00:00:51.439 --> 00:00:51.449 
too much on features since I've already

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:52.790 
too much on features since I've already
done<00:00:51.600> it<00:00:51.719> with<00:00:51.840> the<00:00:51.989> original<00:00:52.170> shockwave

00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:52.800 
done it with the original shockwave

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:56.180 
done it with the original shockwave
review<00:00:53.899> and<00:00:54.899> you<00:00:55.050> can<00:00:55.079> train<00:00:55.410> to<00:00:55.649> long<00:00:55.860> arms

00:00:56.180 --> 00:00:56.190 
review and you can train to long arms

00:00:56.190 --> 00:00:57.920 
review and you can train to long arms
vehicle<00:00:56.579> mode<00:00:56.760> again<00:00:57.420> I<00:00:57.449> think<00:00:57.719> he<00:00:57.780> looks

00:00:57.920 --> 00:00:57.930 
vehicle mode again I think he looks

00:00:57.930 --> 00:00:59.569 
vehicle mode again I think he looks
better<00:00:57.989> a<00:00:58.199> shockwave<00:00:58.530> in<00:00:58.859> both<00:00:59.039> modes<00:00:59.280> in<00:00:59.489> the

00:00:59.569 --> 00:00:59.579 
better a shockwave in both modes in the

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:02.360 
better a shockwave in both modes in the
purple<00:01:00.530> but<00:01:01.530> I'm<00:01:01.620> gonna<00:01:01.770> show<00:01:01.980> all<00:01:02.160> of<00:01:02.280> them

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:02.370 
purple but I'm gonna show all of them

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:05.509 
purple but I'm gonna show all of them
off<00:01:02.719> just<00:01:03.719> for<00:01:03.930> posterity's<00:01:04.350> sake<00:01:04.710> go<00:01:05.369> ahead

00:01:05.509 --> 00:01:05.519 
off just for posterity's sake go ahead

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:07.580 
off just for posterity's sake go ahead
and<00:01:05.610> flip<00:01:05.790> that<00:01:06.000> cannon<00:01:06.840> down<00:01:06.990> and<00:01:07.260> the<00:01:07.320> hook

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:07.590 
and flip that cannon down and the hook

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:12.109 
and flip that cannon down and the hook
will<00:01:07.619> flip<00:01:07.950> up<00:01:09.170> spin<00:01:10.170> it<00:01:10.260> around<00:01:10.350> and<00:01:11.100> then<00:01:12.060> you

00:01:12.109 --> 00:01:12.119 
will flip up spin it around and then you

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:13.340 
will flip up spin it around and then you
basically<00:01:12.270> want<00:01:12.570> to<00:01:12.600> flip<00:01:12.810> these<00:01:12.960> little<00:01:13.170> feet

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:13.350 
basically want to flip these little feet

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:17.570 
basically want to flip these little feet
panels<00:01:13.710> up<00:01:15.500> and<00:01:16.500> then<00:01:16.619> angle<00:01:16.890> the<00:01:17.159> all<00:01:17.340> these

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:17.580 
panels up and then angle the all these

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:21.170 
panels up and then angle the all these
down<00:01:18.049> and<00:01:19.549> turn<00:01:20.549> that<00:01:20.640> around<00:01:20.790> and<00:01:21.030> that

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:21.180 
down and turn that around and that

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:25.340 
down and turn that around and that
essentially<00:01:21.600> is<00:01:21.840> his<00:01:22.049> crane<00:01:22.350> mode<00:01:24.350> right

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:25.350 
essentially is his crane mode right

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:28.219 
essentially is his crane mode right
there<00:01:26.330> again<00:01:27.330> not<00:01:27.540> a<00:01:27.570> whole<00:01:27.750> lot<00:01:27.960> for<00:01:28.140> the

00:01:28.219 --> 00:01:28.229 
there again not a whole lot for the

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:29.840 
there again not a whole lot for the
crane<00:01:28.470> again<00:01:28.770> rotates<00:01:29.250> the<00:01:29.430> cannons<00:01:29.790> are

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:29.850 
crane again rotates the cannons are

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:32.840 
crane again rotates the cannons are
flipped<00:01:30.060> away<00:01:31.159> but<00:01:32.159> there's<00:01:32.340> his<00:01:32.490> Autobot

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:32.850 
flipped away but there's his Autobot

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:39.380 
flipped away but there's his Autobot
vehicle<00:01:33.240> own<00:01:36.500> transform<00:01:37.500> him<00:01:37.680> to<00:01:38.090> go<00:01:39.090> to<00:01:39.150> long

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:39.390 
vehicle own transform him to go to long

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:41.240 
vehicle own transform him to go to long
arm<00:01:39.630> first<00:01:39.930> go<00:01:40.470> ahead<00:01:40.619> and<00:01:40.710> take<00:01:40.829> that<00:01:40.860> off<00:01:41.100> it

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:41.250 
arm first go ahead and take that off it

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:43.520 
arm first go ahead and take that off it
just<00:01:41.280> makes<00:01:41.579> it<00:01:41.670> easier

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:43.530 
just makes it easier

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:47.480 
just makes it easier
you<00:01:44.159> pick<00:01:44.490> him<00:01:44.579> up<00:01:44.700> and<00:01:45.500> split<00:01:46.500> his<00:01:46.590> legs<00:01:46.860> I'll

00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:47.490 
you pick him up and split his legs I'll

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:50.450 
you pick him up and split his legs I'll
keep<00:01:47.729> those<00:01:47.880> attached<00:01:48.240> here<00:01:49.159> fold<00:01:50.159> that<00:01:50.280> up

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:50.460 
keep those attached here fold that up

00:01:50.460 --> 00:02:01.679 
keep those attached here fold that up
and<00:01:50.640> flip<00:01:50.909> out<00:01:51.030> the<00:01:51.060> feet

00:02:01.679 --> 00:02:01.689 

00:02:01.689 --> 00:02:09.270 

and<00:02:03.520> flip<00:02:04.520> these<00:02:04.640> up<00:02:05.170> and<00:02:06.170> pull<00:02:06.890> the<00:02:07.009> arms<00:02:07.040> down

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:09.280 
and flip these up and pull the arms down

00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:14.020 
and flip these up and pull the arms down
yep<00:02:11.650> and<00:02:12.650> flip<00:02:12.950> these<00:02:13.099> there's<00:02:13.519> little<00:02:13.819> tabs

00:02:14.020 --> 00:02:14.030 
yep and flip these there's little tabs

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:15.190 
yep and flip these there's little tabs
here<00:02:14.180> on<00:02:14.300> the<00:02:14.390> side<00:02:14.569> you<00:02:14.720> want<00:02:14.840> to<00:02:14.870> flip<00:02:15.050> those

00:02:15.190 --> 00:02:15.200 
here on the side you want to flip those

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:21.550 
here on the side you want to flip those
up<00:02:17.980> and<00:02:18.980> then<00:02:19.220> the<00:02:19.370> flip<00:02:19.580> is<00:02:20.380> flip<00:02:21.380> these

00:02:21.550 --> 00:02:21.560 
up and then the flip is flip these

00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:23.350 
up and then the flip is flip these
panels<00:02:22.010> down<00:02:22.190> and<00:02:22.459> attach<00:02:22.730> them<00:02:22.910> to<00:02:23.030> his<00:02:23.180> arm

00:02:23.350 --> 00:02:23.360 
panels down and attach them to his arm

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:27.100 
panels down and attach them to his arm
and<00:02:23.630> flip<00:02:24.080> his<00:02:24.200> hand<00:02:24.440> out<00:02:25.720> rotate<00:02:26.720> his<00:02:26.870> hand

and<00:05:26.080> and<00:05:26.260> just<00:05:26.560> to<00:05:26.650> get<00:05:26.770> an<00:05:26.860> idea<00:05:26.920> of<00:05:27.310> how<00:05:27.550> much

00:05:28.080 --> 00:05:28.090 
and and just to get an idea of how much

00:05:28.090 --> 00:05:30.450 
and and just to get an idea of how much
how<00:05:28.930> much<00:05:29.020> bigger<00:05:29.320> he<00:05:29.530> gets<00:05:29.560> in<00:05:29.890> shockwave<00:05:30.280> but

00:05:30.450 --> 00:05:30.460 
how much bigger he gets in shockwave but

00:05:30.460 --> 00:05:31.650 
how much bigger he gets in shockwave but
I<00:05:30.490> couldn't<00:05:30.760> do<00:05:30.850> this<00:05:30.970> the<00:05:31.090> first<00:05:31.300> time<00:05:31.480> since

00:05:31.650 --> 00:05:31.660 
I couldn't do this the first time since

00:05:31.660 --> 00:05:33.870 
I couldn't do this the first time since
I<00:05:31.750> only<00:05:31.870> had<00:05:32.050> the<00:05:32.200> one<00:05:32.340> there<00:05:33.340> he<00:05:33.460> is<00:05:33.580> next<00:05:33.760> to

00:05:33.870 --> 00:05:33.880 
I only had the one there he is next to

00:05:33.880 --> 00:05:37.650 
I only had the one there he is next to
long<00:05:34.090> arm<00:05:35.400> so<00:05:36.400> you<00:05:36.430> can<00:05:36.520> see<00:05:36.640> there's<00:05:37.000> a<00:05:37.060> lot<00:05:37.330> of

00:05:37.650 --> 00:05:37.660 
long arm so you can see there's a lot of

00:05:37.660 --> 00:05:39.930 
long arm so you can see there's a lot of
I<00:05:38.460> mean<00:05:39.460> while<00:05:39.670> there's<00:05:39.820> certainly

00:05:39.930 --> 00:05:39.940 
I mean while there's certainly

00:05:39.940 --> 00:05:42.270 
I mean while there's certainly
similarities<00:05:40.950> there's<00:05:41.950> a<00:05:42.010> lot<00:05:42.160> of

00:05:42.270 --> 00:05:42.280 
similarities there's a lot of

00:05:42.280 --> 00:05:43.740 
similarities there's a lot of
differences<00:05:42.760> between<00:05:42.940> those<00:05:43.210> two<00:05:43.420> figures

00:05:43.740 --> 00:05:43.750 
differences between those two figures

00:05:43.750 --> 00:05:52.400 
differences between those two figures
too<00:05:46.080> which<00:05:47.080> is<00:05:47.230> very<00:05:47.410> cool

00:05:52.400 --> 00:05:52.410 

00:05:52.410 --> 00:05:54.720 

I'm<00:05:53.410> not<00:05:53.530> I'm<00:05:53.740> not<00:05:53.770> gonna<00:05:53.980> bother<00:05:54.160> turning

00:05:54.720 --> 00:05:54.730 
I'm not I'm not gonna bother turning

00:05:54.730 --> 00:05:56.370 
I'm not I'm not gonna bother turning
long<00:05:55.000> arm<00:05:55.210> into<00:05:55.360> shockwave<00:05:55.810> as<00:05:55.960> well

00:05:56.370 --> 00:05:56.380 
long arm into shockwave as well

00:05:56.380 --> 00:05:59.100 
long arm into shockwave as well
yes<00:05:56.920> since<00:05:57.190> we've<00:05:57.610> already<00:05:57.760> seen<00:05:58.030> that<00:05:58.210> but

00:05:59.100 --> 00:05:59.110 
yes since we've already seen that but

00:05:59.110 --> 00:06:01.170 
yes since we've already seen that but

00:06:01.170 --> 00:06:01.180 
just to show your mouth there he is

00:06:01.180 --> 00:06:04.200 
just to show your mouth there he is
very<00:06:01.540> cool<00:06:01.750> look<00:06:02.650> one<00:06:03.280> of<00:06:03.370> the<00:06:03.430> few<00:06:03.670> repaints

00:06:04.200 --> 00:06:04.210 
very cool look one of the few repaints

00:06:04.210 --> 00:06:05.850 
very cool look one of the few repaints
in<00:06:04.330> the<00:06:04.420> animated<00:06:04.720> line<00:06:05.020> that<00:06:05.260> I<00:06:05.320> can<00:06:05.500> I<00:06:05.650> can

00:06:05.850 --> 00:06:05.860 
in the animated line that I can I can

00:06:05.860 --> 00:06:07.500 
in the animated line that I can I can
totally<00:06:06.190> and<00:06:07.000> without<00:06:07.300> reservation
