did great gesture good very why so DLP
technology<00:00:38.770> how<00:00:39.399> do<00:00:39.460> you<00:00:39.730> describe<00:00:40.149> what<00:00:40.570> it

00:00:40.709 --> 00:00:40.719 
technology how do you describe what it

00:00:40.719 --> 00:00:42.540 
technology how do you describe what it
does<00:00:40.960> and<00:00:41.200> how<00:00:41.320> it<00:00:41.350> works<00:00:41.680> to<00:00:41.920> those<00:00:42.100> that<00:00:42.399> go

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:42.550 
does and how it works to those that go

00:00:42.550 --> 00:00:44.639 
does and how it works to those that go
okay<00:00:43.270> its<00:00:43.510> initials<00:00:43.930> but<00:00:44.140> what<00:00:44.289> does<00:00:44.379> it<00:00:44.410> mean

00:00:44.639 --> 00:00:44.649 
okay its initials but what does it mean

00:00:44.649 --> 00:00:46.500 
okay its initials but what does it mean
digital<00:00:45.129> light<00:00:45.280> processing<00:00:45.520> what<00:00:46.329> does<00:00:46.420> that

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:46.510 
digital light processing what does that

00:00:46.510 --> 00:00:49.590 
digital light processing what does that
mean<00:00:46.719> well<00:00:47.170> basically<00:00:47.500> it's<00:00:48.070> a<00:00:48.300> million<00:00:49.300> tiny

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:49.600 
mean well basically it's a million tiny

00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:53.639 
mean well basically it's a million tiny
mirrors<00:00:50.110> on<00:00:50.350> a<00:00:50.410> chip<00:00:50.829> that<00:00:51.550> is<00:00:52.649> amazingly

00:00:53.639 --> 00:00:53.649 
mirrors on a chip that is amazingly

00:00:53.649 --> 00:00:57.299 
mirrors on a chip that is amazingly
creating<00:00:54.460> a<00:00:54.550> picture<00:00:54.910> the<00:00:55.750> mirrors<00:00:56.309> work

00:00:57.299 --> 00:00:57.309 
creating a picture the mirrors work

00:00:57.309 --> 00:01:00.000 
creating a picture the mirrors work
similar<00:00:57.760> to<00:00:58.270> a<00:00:58.300> PC<00:00:59.170> and<00:00:59.410> that<00:00:59.530> their<00:00:59.800> binary

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:00.010 
similar to a PC and that their binary

00:01:00.010 --> 00:01:02.220 
similar to a PC and that their binary
they<00:01:00.550> turn<00:01:00.789> on<00:01:00.969> and<00:01:01.210> off<00:01:01.300> but<00:01:01.840> they<00:01:01.960> turn<00:01:02.199> on

00:01:02.220 --> 00:01:02.230 
they turn on and off but they turn on

00:01:02.230 --> 00:01:04.619 
they turn on and off but they turn on
and<00:01:02.440> off<00:01:02.710> about<00:01:03.160> thousands<00:01:04.030> of<00:01:04.210> times<00:01:04.420> a

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:04.629 
and off about thousands of times a

00:01:04.629 --> 00:01:07.980 
and off about thousands of times a
second<00:01:05.050> Wow<00:01:05.259> and<00:01:05.590> in<00:01:05.950> the<00:01:06.039> process<00:01:06.570> they<00:01:07.570> they

00:01:07.980 --> 00:01:07.990 
second Wow and in the process they they

00:01:07.990 --> 00:01:11.190 
second Wow and in the process they they
can<00:01:08.229> create<00:01:08.649> a<00:01:08.950> very<00:01:09.789> accurate<00:01:10.200> digitally

00:01:11.190 --> 00:01:11.200 
can create a very accurate digitally

00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:13.830 
can create a very accurate digitally
accurate<00:01:11.679> picture<00:01:11.950> that<00:01:12.819> really<00:01:13.179> is<00:01:13.450> superior

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:13.840 
accurate picture that really is superior

00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:15.809 
accurate picture that really is superior
to<00:01:14.020> any<00:01:14.289> other<00:01:14.380> technology<00:01:14.770> out<00:01:15.310> there<00:01:15.340> well

00:01:15.809 --> 00:01:15.819 
to any other technology out there well

00:01:15.819 --> 00:01:17.339 
to any other technology out there well
how<00:01:15.970> is<00:01:16.119> it<00:01:16.149> then<00:01:16.450> that<00:01:16.479> these<00:01:16.780> million

00:01:17.339 --> 00:01:17.349 
how is it then that these million

00:01:17.349 --> 00:01:19.260 
how is it then that these million
mirrors<00:01:17.770> are<00:01:18.009> actually<00:01:18.459> doing<00:01:18.729> what<00:01:19.030> they<00:01:19.209> do

00:01:19.260 --> 00:01:19.270 
mirrors are actually doing what they do

00:01:19.270 --> 00:01:21.089 
mirrors are actually doing what they do
to<00:01:19.810> make<00:01:20.050> the<00:01:20.259> picture<00:01:20.440> I<00:01:20.590> mean<00:01:20.740> turning<00:01:20.950> on

00:01:21.089 --> 00:01:21.099 
to make the picture I mean turning on

00:01:21.099 --> 00:01:22.889 
to make the picture I mean turning on
and<00:01:21.280> often<00:01:21.610> and<00:01:21.759> it's<00:01:22.090> like<00:01:22.240> okay<00:01:22.509> we've<00:01:22.690> sort

00:01:22.889 --> 00:01:22.899 
and often and it's like okay we've sort

00:01:22.899 --> 00:01:24.120 
and often and it's like okay we've sort
of<00:01:22.929> got<00:01:23.080> the<00:01:23.110> concept<00:01:23.649> but<00:01:23.770> what<00:01:23.979> does<00:01:24.099> that

00:01:24.120 --> 00:01:24.130 
of got the concept but what does that

00:01:24.130 --> 00:01:25.770 
of got the concept but what does that
have<00:01:24.280> to<00:01:24.520> do<00:01:24.700> with<00:01:25.000> such<00:01:25.179> an<00:01:25.330> incredible

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:25.780 
have to do with such an incredible

00:01:25.780 --> 00:01:27.990 
have to do with such an incredible
looking<00:01:26.050> picture<00:01:26.349> well<00:01:26.979> the<00:01:27.099> real<00:01:27.280> genius<00:01:27.640> is

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:28.000 
looking picture well the real genius is

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:31.830 
looking picture well the real genius is
is<00:01:28.240> that<00:01:28.920> it<00:01:29.920> uses<00:01:30.190> a<00:01:30.399> chip<00:01:31.060> making<00:01:31.390> a

00:01:31.830 --> 00:01:31.840 
is that it uses a chip making a

00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:34.169 
is that it uses a chip making a
semiconductor<00:01:32.709> process<00:01:33.250> so<00:01:33.729> that<00:01:33.759> it's<00:01:34.090> a

00:01:34.169 --> 00:01:34.179 
semiconductor process so that it's a

00:01:34.179 --> 00:01:38.910 
semiconductor process so that it's a
very<00:01:34.539> reliable<00:01:34.959> very<00:01:35.640> duplicitous<00:01:37.920> process

00:01:38.910 --> 00:01:38.920 
very reliable very duplicitous process

00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:41.490 
very reliable very duplicitous process
that<00:01:39.220> we<00:01:39.520> can<00:01:39.670> make<00:01:39.849> these<00:01:40.030> mirrors<00:01:40.509> operate

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:41.500 
that we can make these mirrors operate

00:01:41.500 --> 00:01:44.010 
that we can make these mirrors operate
independently<00:01:42.099> so<00:01:42.369> each<00:01:42.580> mirror<00:01:43.360> controls

00:01:44.010 --> 00:01:44.020 
independently so each mirror controls

00:01:44.020 --> 00:01:47.460 
independently so each mirror controls
one<00:01:44.590> or<00:01:44.739> more<00:01:44.860> pixels<00:01:45.310> on<00:01:45.610> the<00:01:45.670> screen<00:01:45.910> and<00:01:46.470> by

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:47.470 
one or more pixels on the screen and by

00:01:47.470 --> 00:01:50.430 
one or more pixels on the screen and by
applying<00:01:47.800> a<00:01:48.130> color<00:01:48.759> wheel<00:01:48.849> or<00:01:49.360> LED<00:01:49.869> technology

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:50.440 
applying a color wheel or LED technology

00:01:50.440 --> 00:01:53.430 
applying a color wheel or LED technology
we<00:01:51.160> can<00:01:51.190> precisely<00:01:51.970> control<00:01:52.300> the<00:01:52.780> amount<00:01:53.170> of

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:53.440 
we can precisely control the amount of

00:01:53.440 --> 00:01:55.979 
we can precisely control the amount of
color<00:01:53.800> that<00:01:54.130> each<00:01:54.250> pixel<00:01:54.729> is<00:01:54.910> for<00:01:55.420> each<00:01:55.569> frame

00:01:55.979 --> 00:01:55.989 
color that each pixel is for each frame

00:01:55.989 --> 00:01:58.710 
color that each pixel is for each frame
independent<00:01:56.920> so<00:01:57.580> when<00:01:58.030> you<00:01:58.149> think<00:01:58.330> about<00:01:58.450> the

00:01:58.710 --> 00:01:58.720 
independent so when you think about the

00:01:58.720 --> 00:02:01.260 
independent so when you think about the
engineering<00:01:59.349> of<00:01:59.440> the<00:01:59.500> whole<00:01:59.739> thing<00:02:00.039> it<00:02:00.280> really

00:02:01.260 --> 00:02:01.270 
engineering of the whole thing it really

00:02:01.270 --> 00:02:04.109 
engineering of the whole thing it really
becomes<00:02:01.660> mind-numbing<00:02:02.550> but<00:02:03.550> when<00:02:03.819> you<00:02:03.910> look

00:02:04.109 --> 00:02:04.119 
becomes mind-numbing but when you look

00:02:04.119 --> 00:02:06.479 
becomes mind-numbing but when you look
at<00:02:04.209> the<00:02:04.330> picture<00:02:04.720> it's<00:02:05.410> very<00:02:05.770> very<00:02:06.039> pleasing

00:02:06.479 --> 00:02:06.489 
at the picture it's very very pleasing

00:02:06.489 --> 00:02:08.070 
at the picture it's very very pleasing
to<00:02:06.610> your<00:02:06.729> eye<00:02:06.789> and<00:02:07.149> for<00:02:07.479> those<00:02:07.569> of<00:02:07.629> you<00:02:07.869> who<00:02:08.050> are

00:02:08.070 --> 00:02:08.080

video podcast I'm holding up for example

00:02:12.610 --> 00:02:15.750 
video podcast I'm holding up for example
a<00:02:12.730> DLP<00:02:13.360> chip<00:02:13.390> and<00:02:13.840> it's<00:02:13.930> very<00:02:14.140> tiny<00:02:14.470> it's<00:02:15.280> very

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:15.760 
a DLP chip and it's very tiny it's very

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:17.100 
a DLP chip and it's very tiny it's very
small<00:02:16.150> that<00:02:16.480> they<00:02:16.870> have

00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:17.110 
small that they have

00:02:17.110 --> 00:02:19.170 
small that they have
such<00:02:17.290> power<00:02:17.620> and<00:02:17.920> such<00:02:18.130> engine<00:02:18.700> if<00:02:18.850> you<00:02:18.970> will

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:19.180 
such power and such engine if you will

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:21.660 
such power and such engine if you will
running<00:02:19.690> what<00:02:20.410> turns<00:02:20.680> out<00:02:20.830> to<00:02:20.890> be<00:02:21.040> incredible

00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:21.670 
running what turns out to be incredible

00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:24.090 
running what turns out to be incredible
displays<00:02:22.090> is<00:02:22.420> truly<00:02:22.900> amazing<00:02:23.170> and<00:02:23.530> I<00:02:23.920> think

00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:24.100 
displays is truly amazing and I think

00:02:24.100 --> 00:02:25.830 
displays is truly amazing and I think
it's<00:02:24.220> fair<00:02:24.430> to<00:02:24.460> say<00:02:24.640> you<00:02:25.090> probably<00:02:25.510> hear<00:02:25.690> it

00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:25.840 
it's fair to say you probably hear it

00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:27.420 
it's fair to say you probably hear it
too<00:02:25.960> much<00:02:26.110> of<00:02:26.290> it<00:02:26.350> that<00:02:26.530> I<00:02:26.560> guess<00:02:26.860> folks<00:02:27.160> used

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:27.430 
too much of it that I guess folks used

00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:28.920 
too much of it that I guess folks used
to<00:02:27.490> think<00:02:27.700> of<00:02:27.820> texas<00:02:28.150> instruments<00:02:28.660> as<00:02:28.780> all

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:28.930 
to think of texas instruments as all

00:02:28.930 --> 00:02:30.510 
to think of texas instruments as all
that<00:02:29.110> great<00:02:29.350> calculator<00:02:29.890> company<00:02:30.310> all<00:02:30.400> right

00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:30.520 
that great calculator company all right

00:02:30.520 --> 00:02:32.160 
that great calculator company all right
that's<00:02:30.670> what<00:02:31.060> you've<00:02:31.240> known<00:02:31.450> been<00:02:31.720> known<00:02:31.900> for

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:32.170 
that's what you've known been known for

00:02:32.170 --> 00:02:34.680 
that's what you've known been known for
all<00:02:32.320> these<00:02:32.470> years<00:02:32.740> then<00:02:33.280> dlp<00:02:33.850> happened<00:02:34.330> and

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:34.690 
all these years then dlp happened and

00:02:34.690 --> 00:02:37.860 
all these years then dlp happened and
it's<00:02:35.560> a<00:02:35.710> major<00:02:35.950> turn<00:02:36.340> around<00:02:36.640> with<00:02:36.880> a<00:02:36.910> very

00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:37.870 
it's a major turn around with a very

00:02:37.870 --> 00:02:40.500 
it's a major turn around with a very
unique<00:02:38.260> technology<00:02:38.920> that<00:02:39.220> is<00:02:39.340> just<00:02:40.060> really

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:40.510 
unique technology that is just really

00:02:40.510 --> 00:02:43.020 
unique technology that is just really
blowing<00:02:40.900> us<00:02:41.140> away<00:02:41.230> lately<00:02:41.620> and<00:02:41.890> you<00:02:42.550> guys<00:02:42.730> are

00:02:43.020 --> 00:02:43.030 
blowing us away lately and you guys are

00:02:43.030 --> 00:02:45.120 
blowing us away lately and you guys are
doing<00:02:43.480> just<00:02:43.510> that<00:02:43.930> so<00:02:44.230> well<00:02:44.560> then<00:02:44.680> what's<00:02:44.890> new

doing just that so well then what's new

00:02:45.130 --> 00:02:47.280 
doing just that so well then what's new
in<00:02:45.370> dlp<00:02:45.670> technology<00:02:46.030> now<00:02:46.630> we<00:02:46.690> know<00:02:46.900> what<00:02:47.080> it<00:02:47.170> is

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:47.290 
in dlp technology now we know what it is

00:02:47.290 --> 00:02:49.050 
in dlp technology now we know what it is
and<00:02:47.500> how<00:02:47.530> it's<00:02:47.770> working<00:02:47.980> and<00:02:48.280> it<00:02:48.430> is<00:02:48.550> amazing

00:02:49.050 --> 00:02:49.060 
and how it's working and it is amazing

00:02:49.060 --> 00:02:51.210 
and how it's working and it is amazing
what<00:02:49.600> are<00:02:49.690> you<00:02:49.780> showing<00:02:50.020> here<00:02:50.350> at<00:02:50.440> Aoife<00:02:50.709> well

we're<00:02:51.370> showing<00:02:51.580> two<00:02:51.880> very<00:02:52.720> interesting<00:02:53.290> new

00:02:54.060 --> 00:02:54.070 
we're showing two very interesting new

00:02:54.070 --> 00:02:57.810 
we're showing two very interesting new
processes<00:02:55.000> one<00:02:55.360> is<00:02:55.840> a<00:02:56.340> technology<00:02:57.340> that<00:02:57.580> we

00:02:57.810 --> 00:02:57.820 
processes one is a technology that we

00:02:57.820 --> 00:03:00.150 
processes one is a technology that we
call<00:02:58.000> brilliant<00:02:58.510> color<00:02:58.750> that<00:02:59.500> is<00:02:59.530> being<00:02:59.920> used

00:03:00.150 --> 00:03:00.160 
call brilliant color that is being used

00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:02.100 
call brilliant color that is being used
in<00:03:00.400> the<00:03:00.489> television<00:03:00.790> in<00:03:01.239> the<00:03:01.660> new<00:03:01.810> front

00:03:02.100 --> 00:03:02.110 
in the television in the new front

00:03:02.110 --> 00:03:03.690 
in the television in the new front
projection<00:03:02.470> products<00:03:03.010> that<00:03:03.190> are<00:03:03.280> coming<00:03:03.580> out

00:03:03.690 --> 00:03:03.700 
projection products that are coming out

00:03:03.700 --> 00:03:06.390 
projection products that are coming out
this<00:03:03.880> year<00:03:03.940> where<00:03:04.420> instead<00:03:05.350> of<00:03:05.410> traditionally

00:03:06.390 --> 00:03:06.400 
this year where instead of traditionally

00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:08.729 
this year where instead of traditionally
three<00:03:06.670> colors<00:03:07.060> is<00:03:07.330> used<00:03:07.630> to<00:03:07.810> create<00:03:08.020> the<00:03:08.440> the

00:03:08.729 --> 00:03:08.739 
three colors is used to create the the

00:03:08.739 --> 00:03:10.530 
three colors is used to create the the
image<00:03:08.950> on<00:03:09.130> the<00:03:09.220> screen<00:03:09.370> we're<00:03:10.209> now<00:03:10.330> using

00:03:10.530 --> 00:03:10.540 
image on the screen we're now using

00:03:10.540 --> 00:03:13.380 
image on the screen we're now using
these<00:03:10.750> many<00:03:10.989> as<00:03:11.170> six<00:03:11.560> so<00:03:12.489> if<00:03:12.850> you<00:03:13.000> think<00:03:13.300> about

00:03:13.380 --> 00:03:13.390 
these many as six so if you think about

00:03:13.390 --> 00:03:15.750 
these many as six so if you think about
all<00:03:13.810> of<00:03:13.840> the<00:03:14.230> dynamics<00:03:15.130> that<00:03:15.190> would<00:03:15.400> go<00:03:15.550> into

00:03:15.750 --> 00:03:15.760 
all of the dynamics that would go into

00:03:15.760 --> 00:03:18.570 
all of the dynamics that would go into
figuring<00:03:16.690> out<00:03:16.750> what<00:03:17.230> how<00:03:17.590> to<00:03:17.650> make<00:03:17.830> a<00:03:17.890> certain

00:03:18.570 --> 00:03:18.580 
figuring out what how to make a certain

00:03:18.580 --> 00:03:21.000 
figuring out what how to make a certain
shade<00:03:18.730> of<00:03:18.820> teal<00:03:19.090> with<00:03:19.420> six<00:03:19.840> different<00:03:20.080> colors

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:21.010 
shade of teal with six different colors

00:03:21.010 --> 00:03:22.620 
shade of teal with six different colors
because<00:03:21.549> we<00:03:21.640> generally<00:03:22.060> tend<00:03:22.239> to<00:03:22.330> think<00:03:22.540> of

00:03:22.620 --> 00:03:22.630 
because we generally tend to think of

00:03:22.630 --> 00:03:24.150 
because we generally tend to think of
red<00:03:22.870> blue<00:03:23.049> and<00:03:23.080> green<00:03:23.260> and<00:03:23.650> everything<00:03:23.980> else

00:03:24.150 --> 00:03:24.160 
red blue and green and everything else

00:03:24.160 --> 00:03:25.949 
red blue and green and everything else
is<00:03:24.340> a<00:03:24.370> combination<00:03:25.030> of<00:03:25.150> some<00:03:25.360> of<00:03:25.450> those<00:03:25.570> right

00:03:25.949 --> 00:03:25.959 
is a combination of some of those right

00:03:25.959 --> 00:03:28.229 
is a combination of some of those right
so<00:03:26.230> when<00:03:26.860> you're<00:03:26.980> doing<00:03:27.010> six<00:03:27.489> is<00:03:27.790> it<00:03:27.970> just<00:03:28.180> that

00:03:28.229 --> 00:03:28.239 
so when you're doing six is it just that

00:03:28.239 --> 00:03:30.360 
so when you're doing six is it just that
it's<00:03:28.450> more<00:03:29.080> brilliant<00:03:29.590> but<00:03:29.739> it's<00:03:30.040> more

00:03:30.360 --> 00:03:30.370 
it's more brilliant but it's more

00:03:30.370 --> 00:03:32.039 
it's more brilliant but it's more
brilliant<00:03:30.910> you<00:03:31.150> get<00:03:31.360> better<00:03:31.630> things<00:03:31.720> like

00:03:32.039 --> 00:03:32.049 
brilliant you get better things like

00:03:32.049 --> 00:03:34.740 
brilliant you get better things like
skin<00:03:32.440> tones<00:03:32.709> because<00:03:33.040> you<00:03:33.370> can<00:03:33.580> be<00:03:33.820> more<00:03:34.090> exact

00:03:34.740 --> 00:03:34.750 
skin tones because you can be more exact

00:03:34.750 --> 00:03:37.920 
skin tones because you can be more exact
to<00:03:35.230> be<00:03:35.380> able<00:03:35.500> to<00:03:35.709> match<00:03:36.010> a<00:03:36.690> very<00:03:37.690> difficult

00:03:37.920 --> 00:03:37.930 
to be able to match a very difficult

00:03:37.930 --> 00:03:40.740 
to be able to match a very difficult
color<00:03:38.410> like<00:03:38.830> a<00:03:38.860> flesh<00:03:39.549> tone<00:03:39.790> or<00:03:40.090> a<00:03:40.120> teal<00:03:40.450> or

00:03:40.740 --> 00:03:40.750 
color like a flesh tone or a teal or

00:03:40.750 --> 00:03:43.740 
color like a flesh tone or a teal or
some<00:03:40.959> of<00:03:41.080> these<00:03:41.489> very<00:03:42.489> natural<00:03:43.060> colors<00:03:43.420> so

00:03:43.740 --> 00:03:43.750 
some of these very natural colors so

00:03:43.750 --> 00:03:45.120 
some of these very natural colors so
it's<00:03:43.959> some<00:03:44.410> of<00:03:44.530> the<00:03:44.590> tricks<00:03:44.799> that<00:03:44.920> we've

00:03:45.120 --> 00:03:45.130 
it's some of the tricks that we've

00:03:45.130 --> 00:03:48.210 
it's some of the tricks that we've
learned<00:03:45.340> from<00:03:45.430> our<00:03:45.670> cinema<00:03:46.500> technology<00:03:47.500> when

00:03:48.210 --> 00:03:48.220 
learned from our cinema technology when

00:03:48.220 --> 00:03:49.620 
learned from our cinema technology when
we<00:03:48.340> work<00:03:48.489> with<00:03:48.640> the<00:03:48.730> Hollywood<00:03:49.090> producers

00:03:49.620 --> 00:03:49.630 
we work with the Hollywood producers

00:03:49.630 --> 00:03:52.860 
we work with the Hollywood producers
that<00:03:49.900> then<00:03:50.080> we<00:03:50.260> can<00:03:50.470> maybe<00:03:51.100> put<00:03:51.700> onto<00:03:51.850> a<00:03:52.060> chip

00:03:52.860 --> 00:03:52.870 
that then we can maybe put onto a chip

00:03:52.870 --> 00:03:54.990 
that then we can maybe put onto a chip
and<00:03:53.049> figure<00:03:53.410> out<00:03:53.470> how<00:03:53.620> to<00:03:53.739> do<00:03:53.920> that<00:03:53.950> in<00:03:54.489> an

00:03:54.990 --> 00:03:55.000 
and figure out how to do that in an

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:58.140 
and figure out how to do that in an
inexpensive<00:03:55.480> dlp<00:03:56.170> TV<00:03:56.530> or<00:03:56.830> projector<00:03:57.340> so<00:03:58.000> it's

00:03:58.140 --> 00:03:58.150 
inexpensive dlp TV or projector so it's

00:03:58.150 --> 00:03:59.820 
inexpensive dlp TV or projector so it's
not<00:03:58.239> enough<00:03:58.540> that<00:03:58.570> it's<00:03:58.900> spectacular<00:03:59.110> looking

00:03:59.820 --> 00:03:59.830 
not enough that it's spectacular looking

00:03:59.830 --> 00:04:01.680 
not enough that it's spectacular looking
high<00:04:00.040> definition<00:04:00.640> for<00:04:00.850> example<00:04:01.330> what<00:04:01.540> you're

00:04:01.680 --> 00:04:01.690 
high definition for example what you're

00:04:01.690 --> 00:04:03.930 
high definition for example what you're
using<00:04:01.900> DLP<00:04:02.500> in<00:04:02.620> many<00:04:02.769> cases<00:04:03.190> that<00:04:03.430> that<00:04:03.730> now

00:04:03.930 --> 00:04:03.940 
using DLP in many cases that that now

00:04:03.940 --> 00:04:05.520 
using DLP in many cases that that now
there's<00:04:04.299> even<00:04:04.570> more<00:04:04.600> brilliant<00:04:04.989> colors

00:04:05.520 --> 00:04:05.530 
there's even more brilliant colors

00:04:05.530 --> 00:04:08.250 
there's even more brilliant colors
literally<00:04:06.519> jumping<00:04:06.880> out<00:04:07.000> at<00:04:07.180> us<00:04:07.299> exactly<00:04:08.110> and

00:04:08.250 --> 00:04:08.260 
literally jumping out at us exactly and

00:04:08.260 --> 00:04:09.660 
literally jumping out at us exactly and
when<00:04:08.380> you<00:04:08.440> talk<00:04:08.590> about<00:04:08.620> jumping<00:04:09.160> out<00:04:09.280> at<00:04:09.430> us<00:04:09.549> it

00:04:09.660 --> 00:04:09.670 
when you talk about jumping out at us it

00:04:09.670 --> 00:04:12.449 
when you talk about jumping out at us it
kind<00:04:09.820> of<00:04:09.850> reminds<00:04:10.180> me<00:04:10.239> of<00:04:10.360> 3d<00:04:11.019> yes<00:04:11.769> I<00:04:11.920> saw<00:04:12.190> a

00:04:12.449 --> 00:04:12.459 
kind of reminds me of 3d yes I saw a

00:04:12.459 --> 00:04:15.479 
kind of reminds me of 3d yes I saw a
unique<00:04:12.970> system<00:04:13.690> that<00:04:14.170> Samsung<00:04:14.769> had<00:04:15.070> at<00:04:15.459> a

00:04:15.479 --> 00:04:15.489 
unique system that Samsung had at a

00:04:15.489 --> 00:04:18.030 
unique system that Samsung had at a

00:04:18.030 --> 00:04:18.040 
press event in New York of month or so

00:04:18.040 --> 00:04:20.039 
press event in New York of month or so
ago<00:04:18.070> and<00:04:18.549> is<00:04:18.970> that<00:04:19.209> what's<00:04:19.479> being<00:04:19.660> displayed

00:04:20.039 --> 00:04:20.049 
ago and is that what's being displayed

00:04:20.049 --> 00:04:22.830 
ago and is that what's being displayed
here<00:04:20.620> as<00:04:20.829> well<00:04:21.040> that<00:04:21.400> this<00:04:21.549> is<00:04:21.760> a<00:04:21.790> new<00:04:22.060> 3d<00:04:22.600> dlp

00:04:22.830 --> 00:04:22.840 
here as well that this is a new 3d dlp

00:04:22.840 --> 00:04:26.820 
here as well that this is a new 3d dlp
TV<00:04:23.710> that<00:04:24.340> literally<00:04:25.000> jumps<00:04:25.419> out<00:04:25.539> at<00:04:25.720> you<00:04:25.870> well

00:04:26.820 --> 00:04:26.830 
TV that literally jumps out at you well

00:04:26.830 --> 00:04:29.460 
TV that literally jumps out at you well
it<00:04:27.039> doesn't<00:04:27.460> have<00:04:27.789> legs<00:04:28.060> but<00:04:28.450> the<00:04:28.870> image<00:04:29.229> does

00:04:29.460 --> 00:04:29.470 
it doesn't have legs but the image does

00:04:29.470 --> 00:04:31.290 
it doesn't have legs but the image does
jump<00:04:30.010> out<00:04:30.190> at<00:04:30.400> you<00:04:30.640> once<00:04:30.880> you<00:04:31.000> put

00:04:31.290 --> 00:04:31.300 
jump out at you once you put

00:04:31.300 --> 00:04:34.379 
jump out at you once you put
once<00:04:31.780> you<00:04:31.870> see<00:04:32.050> it<00:04:32.080> it<00:04:33.009> is<00:04:33.190> a<00:04:33.220> 3d<00:04:33.669> TV<00:04:33.879> it's<00:04:34.210> the

00:04:34.379 --> 00:04:34.389 
once you see it it is a 3d TV it's the

00:04:34.389 --> 00:04:37.320 
once you see it it is a 3d TV it's the
first<00:04:34.659> public<00:04:35.110> showing<00:04:35.379> of<00:04:35.740> the<00:04:36.310> DLP<00:04:36.789> 3d

00:04:37.320 --> 00:04:37.330 
first public showing of the DLP 3d

00:04:37.330 --> 00:04:40.890 
first public showing of the DLP 3d
technology<00:04:37.990> and<00:04:38.110> televisions<00:04:38.789> worldwide<00:04:39.900> and

00:04:40.890 --> 00:04:40.900 
technology and televisions worldwide and

00:04:40.900 --> 00:04:43.110 
technology and televisions worldwide and
what<00:04:41.110> enables<00:04:41.620> it<00:04:41.860> is<00:04:42.099> that<00:04:42.610> little<00:04:42.819> mirror

00:04:43.110 --> 00:04:43.120 
what enables it is that little mirror

00:04:43.120 --> 00:04:45.360 
what enables it is that little mirror
bouncing<00:04:43.870> back<00:04:44.050> and<00:04:44.229> forth<00:04:44.319> can<00:04:44.770> actually

00:04:45.360 --> 00:04:45.370 
bouncing back and forth can actually

00:04:45.370 --> 00:04:48.450 
bouncing back and forth can actually
goes<00:04:46.180> fast<00:04:46.569> enough<00:04:47.039> thousands<00:04:48.039> of<00:04:48.099> times<00:04:48.280> a

00:04:48.450 --> 00:04:48.460 
goes fast enough thousands of times a

00:04:48.460 --> 00:04:50.550 
goes fast enough thousands of times a
second<00:04:48.819> remember<00:04:49.180> yeah<00:04:49.419> that<00:04:49.810> that<00:04:50.139> it<00:04:50.349> can

00:04:50.550 --> 00:04:50.560 
second remember yeah that that it can

00:04:50.560 --> 00:04:55.879 
second remember yeah that that it can
create<00:04:51.250> multiple<00:04:51.870> images<00:04:52.870> with<00:04:53.409> one<00:04:54.009> chip<00:04:54.659> so

00:04:55.879 --> 00:04:55.889 
create multiple images with one chip so

00:04:55.889 --> 00:04:59.159 
create multiple images with one chip so
it's<00:04:56.889> a<00:04:57.069> feat<00:04:57.310> of<00:04:57.430> engineering<00:04:58.060> that<00:04:58.169> it's

00:04:59.159 --> 00:04:59.169 
it's a feat of engineering that it's

00:04:59.169 --> 00:05:00.899 
it's a feat of engineering that it's
difficult<00:04:59.319> to<00:04:59.710> understand<00:05:00.190> but<00:05:00.430> it<00:05:00.610> really

00:05:00.899 --> 00:05:00.909 
difficult to understand but it really

00:05:00.909 --> 00:05:05.790 
difficult to understand but it really
works<00:05:01.210> so<00:05:01.659> all<00:05:02.590> you<00:05:02.650> the<00:05:03.639> new<00:05:04.620> TVs<00:05:05.620> that<00:05:05.710> are

00:05:05.790 --> 00:05:05.800 
works so all you the new TVs that are

00:05:05.800 --> 00:05:07.409 
works so all you the new TVs that are
coming<00:05:06.069> out<00:05:06.159> from<00:05:06.370> Samsung<00:05:06.849> and<00:05:07.000> Mitsubishi

00:05:07.409 --> 00:05:07.419 
coming out from Samsung and Mitsubishi

00:05:07.419 --> 00:05:10.290 
coming out from Samsung and Mitsubishi
now<00:05:08.169> I<00:05:08.229> have<00:05:08.349> this<00:05:08.650> capability<00:05:08.919> put<00:05:09.580> in<00:05:09.729> and<00:05:10.210> of

00:05:10.290 --> 00:05:10.300 
now I have this capability put in and of

00:05:10.300 --> 00:05:11.459 
now I have this capability put in and of
course<00:05:10.479> while<00:05:10.629> you<00:05:10.719> still<00:05:10.900> need<00:05:11.110> to<00:05:11.259> wear<00:05:11.440> a

00:05:11.459 --> 00:05:11.469 
course while you still need to wear a

00:05:11.469 --> 00:05:13.680 
course while you still need to wear a
pair<00:05:11.740> of<00:05:11.860> glasses<00:05:12.069> they're<00:05:12.639> not<00:05:12.849> big<00:05:13.180> bulky

00:05:13.680 --> 00:05:13.690 
pair of glasses they're not big bulky

00:05:13.690 --> 00:05:15.719 
pair of glasses they're not big bulky
ugly<00:05:14.080> things<00:05:14.379> as<00:05:14.680> a<00:05:14.919> matter<00:05:15.159> of<00:05:15.219> fact<00:05:15.280> we<00:05:15.550> have

00:05:15.719 --> 00:05:15.729 
ugly things as a matter of fact we have

00:05:15.729 --> 00:05:16.860 
ugly things as a matter of fact we have
some<00:05:16.000> here<00:05:16.180> I<00:05:16.240> don't<00:05:16.449> know<00:05:16.539> they're<00:05:16.719> right

00:05:16.860 --> 00:05:16.870 
some here I don't know they're right

00:05:16.870 --> 00:05:17.999 
some here I don't know they're right
here<00:05:16.900> I<00:05:17.080> thought<00:05:17.289> maybe<00:05:17.500> it<00:05:17.620> was<00:05:17.710> just<00:05:17.770> your

00:05:17.999 --> 00:05:18.009 
here I thought maybe it was just your

00:05:18.009 --> 00:05:20.640 
here I thought maybe it was just your
sunglasses<00:05:18.520> for<00:05:18.909> but<00:05:19.539> I'm<00:05:19.690> now<00:05:19.900> putting<00:05:20.440> on

00:05:20.640 --> 00:05:20.650 
sunglasses for but I'm now putting on

00:05:20.650 --> 00:05:22.980 
sunglasses for but I'm now putting on
and<00:05:21.129> this<00:05:21.250> is<00:05:21.430> the<00:05:22.180> electronics<00:05:22.750> at<00:05:22.900> the

00:05:22.980 --> 00:05:22.990 
and this is the electronics at the

00:05:22.990 --> 00:05:25.439 
and this is the electronics at the
on/off<00:05:23.349> switch<00:05:23.620> yeah<00:05:24.030> again<00:05:25.030> those<00:05:25.210> of<00:05:25.360> you

00:05:25.439 --> 00:05:25.449 
on/off switch yeah again those of you

00:05:25.449 --> 00:05:26.850 
on/off switch yeah again those of you
watching<00:05:25.599> the<00:05:25.840> podcast<00:05:26.050> you<00:05:26.500> see<00:05:26.680> that

00:05:26.850 --> 00:05:26.860 
watching the podcast you see that

00:05:26.860 --> 00:05:29.339 
watching the podcast you see that
they're<00:05:27.039> not<00:05:27.250> big<00:05:27.669> bulky<00:05:28.360> obtrusive<00:05:29.020> the<00:05:29.199> old

00:05:29.339 --> 00:05:29.349 
they're not big bulky obtrusive the old

00:05:29.349 --> 00:05:30.809 
they're not big bulky obtrusive the old
stuff<00:05:29.680> we<00:05:29.889> used<00:05:30.039> to<00:05:30.129> have<00:05:30.250> to<00:05:30.400> wear<00:05:30.550> or<00:05:30.699> they're

00:05:30.819 --> 00:05:33.180 
stuff we used to have to wear or they're
not<00:05:30.849> flimsy<00:05:31.210> cardboard<00:05:31.569> either<00:05:32.050> so<00:05:32.650> this<00:05:33.009> is

00:05:33.180 --> 00:05:33.190 
not flimsy cardboard either so this is

00:05:33.190 --> 00:05:35.010 
not flimsy cardboard either so this is
what<00:05:33.400> you<00:05:33.550> would<00:05:33.699> then<00:05:33.940> utilize<00:05:34.419> to<00:05:34.810> watch

00:05:35.010 --> 00:05:35.020 
what you would then utilize to watch

00:05:35.020 --> 00:05:37.110 
what you would then utilize to watch
these<00:05:35.319> images<00:05:35.830> literally<00:05:36.310> jump<00:05:36.580> out<00:05:36.729> at<00:05:36.909> you

00:05:37.110 --> 00:05:37.120 
these images literally jump out at you

00:05:37.120 --> 00:05:39.600 
these images literally jump out at you
in<00:05:37.270> fact<00:05:37.539> truly<00:05:37.900> is<00:05:38.289> amazing<00:05:38.469> I<00:05:39.190> mean<00:05:39.490> when<00:05:39.580> I

00:05:39.600 --> 00:05:39.610 
in fact truly is amazing I mean when I

00:05:39.610 --> 00:05:41.730 
in fact truly is amazing I mean when I
watch<00:05:39.909> this<00:05:40.210> it<00:05:40.449> did<00:05:40.719> through<00:05:41.020> me<00:05:41.199> because<00:05:41.710> I

00:05:41.730 --> 00:05:41.740 
watch this it did through me because I

00:05:41.740 --> 00:05:43.589 
watch this it did through me because I
thought<00:05:42.009> the<00:05:42.159> stuff<00:05:42.370> was<00:05:42.520> coming<00:05:42.699> at<00:05:42.909> me<00:05:43.029> and

00:05:43.589 --> 00:05:43.599 
thought the stuff was coming at me and

00:05:43.599 --> 00:05:45.719 
thought the stuff was coming at me and
and<00:05:44.259> it<00:05:44.380> does<00:05:44.529> look<00:05:44.710> that<00:05:44.740> way<00:05:44.919> because<00:05:45.219> the

00:05:45.719 --> 00:05:45.729 
and it does look that way because the

00:05:45.729 --> 00:05:48.360 
and it does look that way because the
the<00:05:46.240> chip<00:05:46.509> can<00:05:46.750> can<00:05:47.229> precisely<00:05:47.620> figure<00:05:48.190> out

00:05:48.360 --> 00:05:48.370 
the chip can can precisely figure out

00:05:48.370 --> 00:05:49.769 
the chip can can precisely figure out
which<00:05:48.610> is<00:05:48.639> going<00:05:49.029> into<00:05:49.240> the<00:05:49.360> left<00:05:49.569> eye<00:05:49.750> and

00:05:49.769 --> 00:05:49.779 
which is going into the left eye and

00:05:49.779 --> 00:05:51.540 
which is going into the left eye and
which<00:05:50.169> is<00:05:50.289> going<00:05:50.469> into<00:05:50.710> the<00:05:50.830> right<00:05:51.009> eye<00:05:51.039> and

00:05:51.540 --> 00:05:51.550 
which is going into the right eye and

00:05:51.550 --> 00:05:53.339 
which is going into the right eye and
when<00:05:52.060> it<00:05:52.180> synced<00:05:52.479> up<00:05:52.539> with<00:05:52.599> the<00:05:52.840> glasses<00:05:53.110> the

00:05:53.339 --> 00:05:53.349 
when it synced up with the glasses the

00:05:53.349 --> 00:05:57.120 
when it synced up with the glasses the
amount<00:05:53.800> of<00:05:53.860> separation<00:05:54.669> is<00:05:55.630> amazing<00:05:56.289> and<00:05:56.440> it's

00:05:57.120 --> 00:05:57.130 
amount of separation is amazing and it's

00:05:57.130 --> 00:05:58.969 
amount of separation is amazing and it's
the<00:05:57.279> separation<00:05:58.060> of<00:05:58.180> the<00:05:58.240> left<00:05:58.509> and<00:05:58.750> the<00:05:58.810> right

00:05:58.969 --> 00:05:58.979 
the separation of the left and the right

00:05:58.979 --> 00:06:01.320 
the separation of the left and the right
combined<00:05:59.979> with<00:06:00.099> the<00:06:00.219> speed<00:06:00.520> of<00:06:00.729> the<00:06:00.759> mirrors

00:06:01.320 --> 00:06:01.330 
combined with the speed of the mirrors

00:06:01.330 --> 00:06:04.050 
combined with the speed of the mirrors
and<00:06:01.360> the<00:06:01.539> DLP<00:06:01.930> chip<00:06:01.960> that<00:06:02.889> enable<00:06:03.550> that<00:06:03.699> image

00:06:04.050 --> 00:06:04.060 
and the DLP chip that enable that image

00:06:04.060 --> 00:06:06.779 
and the DLP chip that enable that image
to<00:06:04.300> come<00:06:04.479> together<00:06:04.629> perfectly<00:06:05.340> in<00:06:06.340> your<00:06:06.400> brain

00:06:06.779 --> 00:06:06.789 
to come together perfectly in your brain

00:06:06.789 --> 00:06:08.909 
to come together perfectly in your brain
so<00:06:07.150> when<00:06:07.330> you're<00:06:07.479> looking<00:06:07.779> at<00:06:07.900> that<00:06:08.050> TV<00:06:08.409> set<00:06:08.680> it

00:06:08.909 --> 00:06:08.919 
so when you're looking at that TV set it

00:06:08.919 --> 00:06:11.399 
so when you're looking at that TV set it
looks<00:06:09.430> as<00:06:09.729> real<00:06:10.180> as<00:06:10.599> anything<00:06:10.840> I've<00:06:11.139> ever<00:06:11.169> seen
