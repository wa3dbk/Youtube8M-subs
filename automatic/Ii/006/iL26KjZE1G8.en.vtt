bristlenose<00:00:39.810> full-grown<00:00:40.810> the<00:00:41.200> one<00:00:41.350> I<00:00:41.380> called

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:41.650 
bristlenose full-grown the one I called

bristlenose full-grown the one I called
the<00:00:41.770> fat<00:00:41.920> bastard<00:00:42.340> I<00:00:42.490> didn't<00:00:42.730> see<00:00:42.820> him<00:00:42.970> for<00:00:43.120> a

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:43.180 
the fat bastard I didn't see him for a

00:00:43.180 --> 00:00:45.990 
the fat bastard I didn't see him for a
couple<00:00:43.390> of<00:00:43.480> weeks<00:00:43.630> so<00:00:44.560> I<00:00:44.680> was<00:00:44.980> waiting<00:00:45.190> till

00:00:45.990 --> 00:00:46.000 
couple of weeks so I was waiting till

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:47.490 
couple of weeks so I was waiting till
last<00:00:46.180> minute<00:00:46.480> for<00:00:46.840> I<00:00:46.930> ripped<00:00:47.140> it<00:00:47.290> down<00:00:47.320> I

00:00:47.490 --> 00:00:47.500 
last minute for I ripped it down I

00:00:47.500 --> 00:00:48.840 
last minute for I ripped it down I
didn't<00:00:47.890> know<00:00:47.950> if<00:00:48.040> he<00:00:48.130> was<00:00:48.250> sleeping<00:00:48.700> you<00:00:48.760> know

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:48.850 
didn't know if he was sleeping you know

00:00:48.850 --> 00:00:51.000 
didn't know if he was sleeping you know
lazy<00:00:49.210> they<00:00:49.510> get<00:00:49.720> so<00:00:50.050> I<00:00:50.080> figured<00:00:50.560> just<00:00:50.650> I<00:00:50.890> mean

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:51.010 
lazy they get so I figured just I mean

00:00:51.010 --> 00:00:55.140 
lazy they get so I figured just I mean
he<00:00:51.100> was<00:00:51.490> old<00:00:51.720> he<00:00:52.720> passed<00:00:53.020> on<00:00:53.730> old<00:00:54.730> age<00:00:54.910> I<00:00:55.120> guess

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:55.150 
he was old he passed on old age I guess

00:00:55.150 --> 00:00:58.680 
he was old he passed on old age I guess
he<00:00:55.630> was<00:00:55.780> big<00:00:56.620> fat<00:00:56.920> and<00:00:57.190> old<00:00:57.310> but<00:00:57.790> static

00:00:58.680 --> 00:00:58.690 
he was big fat and old but static

00:00:58.690 --> 00:01:00.390 
he was big fat and old but static
getting<00:00:59.050> some<00:00:59.140> algae<00:00:59.470> on<00:00:59.650> so<00:01:00.010> you<00:01:00.100> got<00:01:00.220> to<00:01:00.310> keep

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:00.400 
getting some algae on so you got to keep

00:01:00.400 --> 00:01:01.850 
getting some algae on so you got to keep
an<00:01:00.520> eye<00:01:00.550> on<00:01:00.580> you<00:01:00.850> tanks

00:01:01.850 --> 00:01:01.860 
an eye on you tanks

00:01:01.860 --> 00:01:04.020 
an eye on you tanks
good<00:01:02.860> reason<00:01:03.190> on<00:01:03.280> that<00:01:03.430> right<00:01:03.610> there<00:01:03.880> I

00:01:04.020 --> 00:01:04.030 
good reason on that right there I

00:01:04.030 --> 00:01:05.970 
good reason on that right there I
noticed<00:01:04.390> the<00:01:04.540> algae<00:01:04.990> so<00:01:05.290> I<00:01:05.320> went<00:01:05.710> looking<00:01:05.830> for

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:05.980 
noticed the algae so I went looking for

00:01:05.980 --> 00:01:09.480 
noticed the algae so I went looking for
him<00:01:07.320> good<00:01:08.320> thing<00:01:08.530> it<00:01:08.650> didn't<00:01:08.890> taint<00:01:09.070> my<00:01:09.250> water

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:15.250 
found was a shell if it was picked clean

00:01:15.250 --> 00:01:19.350 
found was a shell if it was picked clean
gone<00:01:17.100> nitrates<00:01:18.100> went<00:01:18.310> up<00:01:18.369> a<00:01:18.460> little<00:01:18.640> not<00:01:18.820> bad<00:01:19.060> a

good<00:01:19.630> filtration<00:01:19.960> I<00:01:20.260> guess<00:01:20.500> helps<00:01:21.190> that<00:01:21.340> out

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:21.550 
good filtration I guess helps that out

00:01:21.550 --> 00:01:24.359 
good filtration I guess helps that out
plus<00:01:21.790> all<00:01:21.970> the<00:01:22.090> plants<00:01:22.510> but<00:01:23.070> yeah<00:01:24.070> so<00:01:24.280> he
