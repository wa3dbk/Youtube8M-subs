00:00:03.510 --> 00:00:08.180
 we open the third and last block 20 next to the field the Inca services are 

00:00:08.180 --> 00:00:12.280
 they experience plots of polycultures with organic management specifically 

00:00:12.280 --> 00:00:16.560
 with corn associated with alfalfa and where it is expected to incorporate 

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:20.760
 post-harvest vegetables the agronomist Javier val di talks to us about 

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:24.690
 the characteristics of this organic management project and the purpose of 

00:00:24.690 --> 00:00:28.340
 generate technologies to transfer the producer in a commercial way 

00:00:34.580 --> 00:00:36.059
 the Agriculture 

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:40.719
 the organic agriculture that is in touch to carry forward 

00:00:41.490 --> 00:00:42.980
 the job 

00:00:42.980 --> 00:00:46.780
 the work of the master of a crop without the use of chemical synthesis products 

00:00:47.470 --> 00:00:48.530
 percent 

00:00:48.530 --> 00:00:50.950
 we refer to this of love 

00:00:50.950 --> 00:00:53.950
 using biological insecticides lourdes of natural fertilizers 

00:00:54.760 --> 00:00:57.760
 tino this product of this industrial no 

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:01.510
 the difference between the organic and the ecological I will do everything I can 

00:01:01.510 --> 00:01:02.330
 more espacious 

00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:04.180
 the project contemplates 

00:01:04.180 --> 00:01:07.000
 p other factors as is 

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:11.810
 The participation of man or the non-exclusion of man from the system is 

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:14.160
 a point a more philosophical concept 

00:01:14.160 --> 00:01:17.320
 organically shaped organic carved shaped sample 

00:01:17.320 --> 00:01:20.660
 we are talking about that we are going to well ahead crops 

00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:22.610
 without the use of 

00:01:22.610 --> 00:01:25.210
 of chemical synthesis products 

00:01:25.210 --> 00:01:26.289
 and in this one 

00:01:26.289 --> 00:01:29.289
 the specific issue the inter what is doing 

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:31.250
 I do not know 

00:01:31.250 --> 00:01:34.250
 piano as the closest antecedent at work 

00:01:34.870 --> 00:01:39.200
 of diago ecology or organic agriculture is the pro-huerta program that 

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:43.230
 Many years ago we are working at the family level in the promotion of systems 

00:01:44.020 --> 00:01:47.130
 I love organic organic at the family level 

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:49.630
 a little 

00:01:49.630 --> 00:01:53.149
 As of this year we started to experience services to work 

00:01:53.149 --> 00:01:53.679
 with 

00:01:53.679 --> 00:01:59.479
 with polyculture plots with organic management in order to generate 

00:01:59.479 --> 00:02:02.579
 technology for tracer and commercial product 

00:02:03.190 --> 00:02:04.880
 p 

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:05.850
 the dynamo 

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:10.449
 conventional agriculture and efe is very strong to which only in the world 

00:02:10.449 --> 00:02:12.109
 that's why they use hebe 

00:02:12.109 --> 00:02:14.959
 Actively chemical synthesis input 

00:02:14.959 --> 00:02:18.059
 in the agriculture that we know, everyone knows 

00:02:18.059 --> 00:02:23.179
 by the way there is no technology this hobby available to start kneading 

00:02:23.179 --> 00:02:24.679
 products without these 

00:02:24.679 --> 00:02:26.529
 without chemical synthesis product 

00:02:26.529 --> 00:02:29.599
 they use the natural site of chemical fertilizers organic fertilizer 

00:02:30.499 --> 00:02:34.199
 josÃ© voucher that we want to adjust this technology for subsidiary company 

00:02:34.199 --> 00:02:35.609
 alternative producer 

00:02:35.609 --> 00:02:37.699
 for when lamothe agriculture 

00:02:37.699 --> 00:02:41.729
 organic arango supported the ecology we are talking about increasing the 

00:02:41.729 --> 00:02:45.290
 production costs lower those that impose the cost-benefit ratio 

00:02:46.729 --> 00:02:49.239
 but I have not done it 

00:02:49.239 --> 00:02:51.149
 making way when walking 

00:02:51.149 --> 00:02:56.399
 but she loved in principle well in many countries including Argentina 

00:02:56.399 --> 00:02:57.329
 as well 

00:02:57.329 --> 00:03:00.569
 there differential prices for organic products 

00:03:00.569 --> 00:03:03.889
 because the consumer a little this episode and you prefer 

00:03:04.669 --> 00:03:09.749
 the price that will pay the subject but make sure to eat safe and 

00:03:09.749 --> 00:03:11.739
 entered without it a unique touch 

00:03:11.739 --> 00:03:15.829
 so good to work, we can say that we have more pressure 

00:03:15.829 --> 00:03:18.169
 We propose the highest price in 

00:03:18.169 --> 00:03:20.629
 in organic products 

00:03:20.629 --> 00:03:24.060
 I'm a little knowing the production costs 

00:03:24.060 --> 00:03:26.159
 and coincidentally only that you have to adjust 

00:03:26.159 --> 00:03:29.989
 to be able to transfer this all element the producer 

00:03:29.989 --> 00:03:33.950
 here in that sense it is already being done and experiences in this regard 

00:03:33.950 --> 00:03:35.929
 this crop is being worked 

00:03:35.929 --> 00:03:38.769
 but when falling from a plot 

00:03:38.769 --> 00:03:42.549
 has a polyculture plot where we will be doing rotations of 

00:03:42.549 --> 00:03:45.200
 crop we have started with this one 

00:03:45.200 --> 00:03:47.689
 corn that the executive is 

00:03:47.689 --> 00:03:50.799
 of this this season associated with alfalfa 

00:03:51.759 --> 00:03:57.259
 percent and the idea is that it's about yourself batch go incorporating crop of 

00:03:57.259 --> 00:03:58.439
 vegetables 

00:03:58.439 --> 00:04:01.029
 all with this organic management
