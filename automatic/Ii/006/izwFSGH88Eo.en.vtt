00:00:15.650 --> 00:00:15.660 
be saved oh so so what we keep hearing

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:17.390 
be saved oh so so what we keep hearing
people<00:00:15.719> say<00:00:16.049> well<00:00:16.560> I<00:00:16.680> better<00:00:16.949> not<00:00:17.039> run<00:00:17.220> that<00:00:17.340> I

00:00:17.390 --> 00:00:17.400 
people say well I better not run that I

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:19.900 
people say well I better not run that I
really<00:00:17.730> like<00:00:17.880> I'm<00:00:18.330> trying<00:00:18.539> to<00:00:18.660> stay<00:00:18.869> saved

something<00:00:20.910> to<00:00:21.119> say<00:00:21.270> and<00:00:21.300> think<00:00:21.449> about<00:00:21.689> this

00:00:21.830 --> 00:00:21.840 
something to say and think about this

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:26.420 
something to say and think about this
the<00:00:22.590> gravity<00:00:23.220> of<00:00:23.250> what<00:00:23.580> God<00:00:23.820> went<00:00:24.150> through<00:00:25.430> the

00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:26.430 
the gravity of what God went through the

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:30.620 
the gravity of what God went through the
grep<00:00:26.789> think<00:00:27.359> about<00:00:27.599> the<00:00:28.189> cross<00:00:29.189> alone<00:00:29.670> just

00:00:30.620 --> 00:00:30.630 
grep think about the cross alone just

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:34.760 
grep think about the cross alone just
the<00:00:30.689> clothes<00:00:32.210> but<00:00:33.210> them<00:00:33.360> at<00:00:33.510> the<00:00:33.630> cross<00:00:33.899> what

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:34.770 
the clothes but them at the cross what

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:38.869 
the clothes but them at the cross what
God<00:00:35.399> and<00:00:35.730> the<00:00:35.940> person<00:00:36.360> of<00:00:36.450> Christ<00:00:36.480> endured<00:00:37.879> the

enjoying<00:01:00.660> the<00:01:00.840> birth<00:01:01.050> process<00:01:05.479> think<00:01:06.479> about

00:01:06.649 --> 00:01:06.659 
enjoying the birth process think about

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:09.830 
enjoying the birth process think about
it<00:01:06.810> too<00:01:06.990> brutal<00:01:07.500> the<00:01:07.890> brutal<00:01:08.159> nature<00:01:08.430> of<00:01:08.850> his

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:09.840 
it too brutal the brutal nature of his

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:14.210 
it too brutal the brutal nature of his

00:01:17.359 --> 00:01:17.369 
purpose of his dying for sinfulness not

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:21.109 
purpose of his dying for sinfulness not
acts<00:01:17.670> of<00:01:18.030> sin<00:01:18.590> acts<00:01:19.590> of<00:01:20.159> sin<00:01:20.460> come<00:01:20.790> as<00:01:20.880> a<00:01:20.909> result

00:01:21.109 --> 00:01:21.119 
acts of sin acts of sin come as a result

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:24.350 
acts of sin acts of sin come as a result
of<00:01:21.420> being<00:01:21.689> sinful<00:01:22.909> sinfulness<00:01:23.909> is<00:01:24.330> a

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:24.360 
of being sinful sinfulness is a

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:28.940 
of being sinful sinfulness is a
conditions<00:01:25.140> as<00:01:25.500> a<00:01:25.830> predisposition<00:01:27.710> max<00:01:28.710> of

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:28.950 
conditions as a predisposition max of

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:31.460 
conditions as a predisposition max of
sin<00:01:29.250> come<00:01:29.579> from<00:01:29.939> come<00:01:30.299> a<00:01:30.450> birth<00:01:30.900> out<00:01:31.110> of<00:01:31.170> the

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:31.470 
sin come from come a birth out of the

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:34.130 
sin come from come a birth out of the
sinful<00:01:32.100> nature<00:01:32.610> yeah<00:01:32.939> there's<00:01:33.299> no<00:01:33.420> place<00:01:33.780> died

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:34.140 
sinful nature yeah there's no place died

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:37.039 
sinful nature yeah there's no place died
and<00:01:34.500> dot<00:01:34.680> the<00:01:34.710> acts<00:01:35.130> of<00:01:35.400> sin<00:01:35.700> he<00:01:36.540> died<00:01:36.780> for

00:01:37.039 --> 00:01:37.049 
and dot the acts of sin he died for

00:01:37.049 --> 00:01:39.920 
and dot the acts of sin he died for
sinfulness<00:01:37.880> yeah

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:39.930 
sinfulness yeah

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:41.960 
sinfulness yeah
I<00:01:39.960> precise<00:01:40.680> technique<00:01:41.070> ourselves<00:01:41.310> a<00:01:41.640> new

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:41.970 
I precise technique ourselves a new

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:45.710 
I precise technique ourselves a new
nature<00:01:43.760> so<00:01:44.760> the<00:01:44.880> Bible<00:01:45.180> says<00:01:45.330> now<00:01:45.480> we're

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:45.720 
nature so the Bible says now we're

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:50.320 
nature so the Bible says now we're
partakers<00:01:46.620> of<00:01:46.740> the<00:01:46.830> divine<00:01:47.010> nature<00:01:47.510> of<00:01:48.510> Christ

00:01:50.320 --> 00:01:50.330 
partakers of the divine nature of Christ

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:55.700 
partakers of the divine nature of Christ
think<00:01:51.330> about<00:01:51.510> this<00:01:53.240> with<00:01:54.240> the<00:01:54.690> gravity<00:01:55.440> of<00:01:55.470> the

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:55.710 
think about this with the gravity of the

00:01:55.710 --> 00:01:59.270 
think about this with the gravity of the
course<00:01:55.979> all<00:01:56.970> that<00:01:57.030> it<00:01:57.450> entails<00:01:57.740> all<00:01:58.740> that<00:01:59.100> god

00:01:59.270 --> 00:01:59.280 
course all that it entails all that god

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:01.370 
course all that it entails all that god
of<00:01:59.430> doing<00:01:59.700> to<00:01:59.850> make<00:02:00.330> it<00:02:00.510> possible<00:02:00.690> for<00:02:01.050> us<00:02:01.320> to

00:02:01.370 --> 00:02:01.380 
of doing to make it possible for us to

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:03.620 
of doing to make it possible for us to
have<00:02:01.650> to<00:02:02.130> be<00:02:02.280> redeemed<00:02:02.580> to<00:02:02.850> have<00:02:02.970> access<00:02:03.240> to

00:02:03.620 --> 00:02:03.630 
have to be redeemed to have access to

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:06.740 
have to be redeemed to have access to
him<00:02:03.810> and<00:02:04.580> with<00:02:05.580> running<00:02:06.000> a<00:02:06.060> red<00:02:06.270> light<00:02:06.300> I'll

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:06.750 
him and with running a red light I'll

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:11.060 
him and with running a red light I'll
lose<00:02:07.280> the<00:02:08.280> work<00:02:08.640> I<00:02:08.880> lose<00:02:09.270> salvation<00:02:10.050> my<00:02:10.649> work

00:02:11.060 --> 00:02:11.070 
lose the work I lose salvation my work

00:02:11.070 --> 00:02:13.760 
lose the work I lose salvation my work
something<00:02:11.820> I've<00:02:11.940> done<00:02:12.090> wrong<00:02:12.300> when<00:02:13.260> the<00:02:13.410> Bible

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:13.770 
something I've done wrong when the Bible

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:15.800 
something I've done wrong when the Bible
teaches<00:02:14.130> us<00:02:14.310> that<00:02:14.489> when<00:02:14.640> Jesus<00:02:14.790> died<00:02:15.180> he<00:02:15.510> says

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:15.810 
teaches us that when Jesus died he says

00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:21.440 
teaches us that when Jesus died he says
it<00:02:16.110> is<00:02:16.680> finished<00:02:17.010> the<00:02:17.640> work<00:02:17.820> is<00:02:18.000> done<00:02:20.270> so<00:02:21.270> think

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:21.450 
it is finished the work is done so think

00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:24.979 
it is finished the work is done so think
about<00:02:21.510> this<00:02:21.950> so<00:02:22.950> in<00:02:23.100> one<00:02:23.310> egg<00:02:23.570> accursed<00:02:24.570> I've

00:02:24.979 --> 00:02:24.989 
about this so in one egg accursed I've

00:02:24.989 --> 00:02:30.110 
about this so in one egg accursed I've
gotta<00:02:25.200> hurry<00:02:25.320> became<00:02:25.590> my<00:02:25.709> salvation<00:02:26.010> back<00:02:29.120> now

00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:30.120 
gotta hurry became my salvation back now

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:33.250 
gotta hurry became my salvation back now
