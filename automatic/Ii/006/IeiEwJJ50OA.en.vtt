00:00:00.410 --> 00:00:04.170
 470 new diesel trains for the 

00:00:02.970 --> 00:00:05.819
 regional traffic 

00:00:04.170 --> 00:00:07.529
 the German railway ag has with the 

00:00:05.819 --> 00:00:09.450
 polish manufacturer psa two 

00:00:07.529 --> 00:00:11.940
 framework agreements 

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:14.009
 at innotrans 2012, the 

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:16.740
 Contracts signed by the 

00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:18.650
 board of engineering folk beetle by the 

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:22.199
 board of directors ulrich homburg 

00:00:18.650 --> 00:00:23.789
 Peter's Chief Financial Officer Robert Kowitz and 

00:00:22.199 --> 00:00:26.250
 board marketing and development 

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:28.380
 marks jedlicka it is the first 

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:30.480
 conclusion with the Polish manufacturer 

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:31.830
 the goal is competition in the 

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:33.960
 strengthen the industry 

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:36.320
 We have been up for a very long time 

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:38.670
 looking for additional suppliers 

00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:40.739
 from the European also from the 

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:42.600
 Asian market and what we at tesa 

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:45.239
 it has convinced, so to speak 

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:46.890
 references from other projects where 

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:49.230
 Competitors of us already at the 

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:51.899
 ordered pisa and the second for 

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:54.480
 is at least as important to us 

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:56.160
 the better with the essential and 

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:57.600
 main components with german 

00:00:56.160 --> 00:01:00.390
 manufacturers work together 

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:04.710
 the possible investment volume is 

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:07.310
 up to 12 billion euros by the end of 2018 

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:09.330
 The vehicles can be called up 

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:12.030
 the interest in our products 

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:14.970
 our vehicles are already driving 

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:16.860
 in italy of ukraine lithuania and 

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:18.930
 Germany we have a lot of experience 

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:21.990
 collected and currently build trains of 

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:24.509
 fourth generation this day today 

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:26.790
 crowns many years of hard work and is crowned 

00:01:24.509 --> 00:01:29.159
 at the same time a confirmation that we 

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:31.170
 our products are on the right track 

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:33.119
 obviously have a quality level 

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:37.950
 achieved that the German course would 

00:01:33.119 --> 00:01:40.770
 the new vehicles are of the link type 

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:41.970
 as 1 2 and 3-piece diesel multiple units 

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:44.610
 retrievable 

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:45.990
 You have capacities from 50 seats 

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:50.909
 and reach a top speed 

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:53.220
 of tempo 120 or 140 something 

00:01:50.909 --> 00:01:55.049
 The quality is there for tesa 

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:57.329
 exactly the same as for all ours 

00:01:55.049 --> 00:01:59.100
 other suppliers have our quality gates 

00:01:57.329 --> 00:02:00.659
 in the procurement process 

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:01.890
 be passed through properly and so on 

00:02:00.659 --> 00:02:03.899
 I think we are very safe 

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:04.640
 that we also have a good product in the end 

00:02:03.899 --> 00:02:08.090
 receive 

00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:09.830
 Peter was founded in 1851 the 

00:02:08.090 --> 00:02:12.080
 company specializes in the 

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:13.400
 Build the modernization and repair of 

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:17.319
 rail vehicles 

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:19.670
 It employs around 3,500 people 

00:02:17.319 --> 00:02:21.440
 diesel meets electro on the 

00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:23.240
 Free area of â€‹â€‹innotrans presented the 

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:25.310
 German railway the first converted 

00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:26.560
 hybrid vehicle for local traffic 

00:02:25.310 --> 00:02:28.850
 together with the 

00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:31.970
 Federal Ministry of Transport and the tognum 

00:02:28.850 --> 00:02:35.330
 daughter mtu a diesel mechanical 

00:02:31.970 --> 00:02:37.040
 railcar of the vt 642 series became too 

00:02:35.330 --> 00:02:39.410
 rebuilt a hybrid vehicle 

00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:41.959
 the joint research project of db 

00:02:39.410 --> 00:02:44.870
 and mtu has the federal ministry for 

00:02:41.959 --> 00:02:47.510
 traffic construction and urban development with 1.9 

00:02:44.870 --> 00:02:48.890
 million euros under the auspices of the 

00:02:47.510 --> 00:02:50.320
 project model regions 

00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:53.269
 electromobility 

00:02:50.320 --> 00:02:56.030
 it is such that we train with this hybrid 

00:02:53.269 --> 00:02:57.860
 With this diesel hybrid pulled the citizen 

00:02:56.030 --> 00:03:00.290
 finally able to show that we too 

00:02:57.860 --> 00:03:02.150
 capable of the latest technology are on 

00:03:00.290 --> 00:03:04.160
 implement the rail if we 

00:03:02.150 --> 00:03:06.830
 kinetic energy converts so 

00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:09.320
 motion energy in electricity and 

00:03:06.830 --> 00:03:12.079
 then continue to drive the train 

00:03:09.320 --> 00:03:14.269
 then not only diesel saves about 25 

00:03:12.079 --> 00:03:16.370
 percent but it is also something for the 

00:03:14.269 --> 00:03:17.860
 Environment and it is a great feeling with 

00:03:16.370 --> 00:03:21.049
 to drive such a train 

00:03:17.860 --> 00:03:23.170
 the new drive system is a hybrid power 

00:03:21.049 --> 00:03:25.880
 pack converts via a generator 

00:03:23.170 --> 00:03:27.049
 braking energy into electrical energy 

00:03:25.880 --> 00:03:28.519
 she is in batteries 

00:03:27.049 --> 00:03:30.019
 cached and can if needed 

00:03:28.519 --> 00:03:32.180
 be removed 

00:03:30.019 --> 00:03:34.280
 Of course we hope for that 

00:03:32.180 --> 00:03:36.049
 the economy the cleanliness 

00:03:34.280 --> 00:03:39.950
 this particular drive then 

00:03:36.049 --> 00:03:41.570
 interspersed and it was the 25 percent co2 

00:03:39.950 --> 00:03:43.489
 saving and fuel saving 

00:03:41.570 --> 00:03:43.760
 then see in the future also in the broad 

00:03:43.489 --> 00:03:45.440
 want 

00:03:43.760 --> 00:03:48.230
 next goal is the early approval 

00:03:45.440 --> 00:03:50.299
 By the Federal Railway Authority the pilot 

00:03:48.230 --> 00:03:52.130
 Train should be on the non-electrified 

00:03:50.299 --> 00:03:53.660
 aschaffenburg miltenberg in 

00:03:52.130 --> 00:03:55.820
 bavaria are used 

00:03:53.660 --> 00:03:59.360
 Reason are the many stops on 

00:03:55.820 --> 00:04:02.180
 this connection we want from the 

00:03:59.360 --> 00:04:02.859
 strategy in 2020 out ecological 

00:04:02.180 --> 00:04:05.450
 become 

00:04:02.859 --> 00:04:08.209
 and we have a very good one here 

00:04:05.450 --> 00:04:10.010
 not just how to do that 

00:04:08.209 --> 00:04:11.150
 that's what hybrid technology wants 

00:04:10.010 --> 00:04:13.310
 project points 

00:04:11.150 --> 00:04:15.910
 In addition, became an environmentally friendly 

00:04:13.310 --> 00:04:18.650
 co2 air conditioning installed 

00:04:15.910 --> 00:04:20.810
 After two years, the eco rail moved 

00:04:18.650 --> 00:04:21.320
 innovation platform a positive 

00:04:20.810 --> 00:04:23.150
 balance sheet 

00:04:21.320 --> 00:04:24.860
 the project continues to grow 

00:04:23.150 --> 00:04:27.560
 continuous dialogue between 

00:04:24.860 --> 00:04:28.160
 industrial policy and operators 

00:04:27.560 --> 00:04:29.960
 fruit 

00:04:28.160 --> 00:04:32.560
 we have been working hard for two years 

00:04:29.960 --> 00:04:35.300
 worked the eco rail innovation 

00:04:32.560 --> 00:04:37.250
 from idea to one, so to speak 

00:04:35.300 --> 00:04:39.620
 to develop a functioning platform 

00:04:37.250 --> 00:04:41.750
 we have become members of it for us 

00:04:39.620 --> 00:04:43.250
 on the one hand have the rail sector with 

00:04:41.750 --> 00:04:45.320
 different operators and on the 

00:04:43.250 --> 00:04:47.120
 not only the industry on the other side 

00:04:45.320 --> 00:04:48.440
 the vdb but also many companies 

00:04:47.120 --> 00:04:51.169
 won to participate 

00:04:48.440 --> 00:04:52.669
 the whole structure thematic fields 

00:04:51.169 --> 00:04:53.200
 identify and now it's all right 

00:04:52.669 --> 00:04:55.370
 Come on 

00:04:53.200 --> 00:04:57.590
 on the innotrans were two 

00:04:55.370 --> 00:04:59.030
 Intentions letters 

00:04:57.590 --> 00:05:01.280
 signed by intent 

00:04:59.030 --> 00:05:04.400
 for the composite project tender 

00:05:01.280 --> 00:05:07.310
 Overhead free traction and for the 

00:05:04.400 --> 00:05:09.409
 h3 hybrid glock we have one 

00:05:07.310 --> 00:05:10.610
 interesting projects in the sense of 

00:05:09.409 --> 00:05:12.380
 word put on the rail 

00:05:10.610 --> 00:05:15.440
 robl to the past with the 

00:05:12.380 --> 00:05:16.430
 modernization of locomotives in 

00:05:15.440 --> 00:05:19.250
 a joint venture with the German 

00:05:16.430 --> 00:05:21.740
 railways in stendal we have 

00:05:19.250 --> 00:05:24.800
 now developed a new product and 

00:05:21.740 --> 00:05:27.770
 the hybrid drive technology there 

00:05:24.800 --> 00:05:29.630
 actually project projected and 

00:05:27.770 --> 00:05:31.700
 You can now do this 

00:05:29.630 --> 00:05:33.140
 project in the operating experience 

00:05:31.700 --> 00:05:34.789
 then gain experience there 

00:05:33.140 --> 00:05:36.430
 collect and use it in the product 

00:05:34.789 --> 00:05:38.539
 to get ready for serial production 

00:05:36.430 --> 00:05:41.060
 16 partners has the platform 

00:05:38.539 --> 00:05:43.700
 meanwhile new delhi are the esg 

00:05:41.060 --> 00:05:45.169
 elektroniksystem und logistik gmbh as well 

00:05:43.700 --> 00:05:47.330
 knorr brake and the berliner 

00:05:45.169 --> 00:05:49.669
 verkehrsbetriebe 

00:05:47.330 --> 00:05:51.439
 Last but not least, we have 

00:05:49.669 --> 00:05:53.479
 Meanwhile, the support from 

00:05:51.439 --> 00:05:54.830
 schavan, the great politician of the woman 

00:05:53.479 --> 00:05:56.419
 has agreed to the 

00:05:54.830 --> 00:05:57.830
 to take umbrage for that, then 

00:05:56.419 --> 00:06:00.110
 in short, this whole platform 

00:05:57.830 --> 00:06:02.990
 starts more and more and wins 

00:06:00.110 --> 00:06:04.580
 he lives in may 2012 he has one 

00:06:02.990 --> 00:06:06.319
 foundation professorship at the university of applied sciences 

00:06:04.580 --> 00:06:08.449
 brandenburg furnished 

00:06:06.319 --> 00:06:09.620
 the professorship of dr 

00:06:08.449 --> 00:06:11.770
 claudia langowsky 

00:06:09.620 --> 00:06:14.139
 Target is the research needs too 

00:06:11.770 --> 00:06:17.139
 Identify and research projects 

00:06:14.139 --> 00:06:17.139
 abut
