00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:31.760 
here's your basic Japanese manual I
would<00:02:29.160> read<00:02:29.340> to<00:02:29.520> you<00:02:29.670> but<00:02:30.060> I<00:02:30.990> wouldn't<00:02:31.620> be<00:02:31.740> able

00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:31.770 
would read to you but I wouldn't be able

00:02:31.770 --> 00:02:34.840 
would read to you but I wouldn't be able
to<00:02:31.950> do<00:02:32.250> that<00:02:32.400> very<00:02:32.460> well

00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:34.850 
to do that very well

00:02:34.850 --> 00:02:41.270 
to do that very well
and<00:02:36.320> here's<00:02:37.320> your<00:02:37.500> machine<00:02:39.620> you<00:02:40.620> know<00:02:40.710> packing

00:02:41.270 --> 00:02:41.280 
and here's your machine you know packing

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:43.070 
and here's your machine you know packing
bags<00:02:41.490> some<00:02:42.150> people<00:02:42.390> find<00:02:42.630> those<00:02:42.750> be<00:02:42.930> very

00:02:43.070 --> 00:02:43.080 
bags some people find those be very

00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:46.340 
bags some people find those be very
important<00:02:44.240> if<00:02:45.240> you're<00:02:45.390> going<00:02:45.420> for<00:02:45.870> you<00:02:46.230> know

00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:46.350 
important if you're going for you know

00:02:46.350 --> 00:02:48.170 
important if you're going for you know
more<00:02:46.620> complete<00:02:47.070> you<00:02:47.220> want<00:02:47.370> the<00:02:47.490> bag<00:02:47.670> if<00:02:47.970> not

00:02:48.170 --> 00:02:48.180 
more complete you want the bag if not

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:50.930 
more complete you want the bag if not
you<00:02:49.110> know<00:02:49.200> the<00:02:49.320> bag<00:02:49.500> is<00:02:49.710> negligible<00:02:50.400> too<00:02:50.640> you

00:02:50.930 --> 00:02:50.940 
you know the bag is negligible too you

00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:53.180 
you know the bag is negligible too you
know<00:02:51.030> some<00:02:51.270> collectors<00:02:51.800> and<00:02:52.800> here's<00:02:53.040> your

00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:53.190 
know some collectors and here's your

00:02:53.190 --> 00:02:56.510 
know some collectors and here's your
system<00:02:53.610> done<00:02:54.090> up<00:02:54.240> in<00:02:54.420> the<00:02:54.600> original<00:02:55.520> maroon

00:02:56.510 --> 00:02:56.520 
system done up in the original maroon

00:02:56.520 --> 00:02:58.010 
system done up in the original maroon
this<00:02:56.670> is<00:02:56.790> more<00:02:56.970> of<00:02:57.030> a<00:02:57.120> silver<00:02:57.450> than<00:02:57.690> a<00:02:57.720> white

00:02:58.010 --> 00:02:58.020 
this is more of a silver than a white

00:02:58.020 --> 00:03:01.460 
this is more of a silver than a white
but<00:02:58.440> or<00:02:59.220> it's<00:02:59.580> a<00:02:59.700> pearlescent<00:03:00.330> white<00:03:00.470> compared

00:03:01.460 --> 00:03:01.470 
but or it's a pearlescent white compared

00:03:01.470 --> 00:03:02.780 
but or it's a pearlescent white compared
to<00:03:01.530> the<00:03:01.620> original<00:03:01.980> but<00:03:02.190> it's<00:03:02.400> that<00:03:02.550> basic

00:03:02.780 --> 00:03:02.790 
to the original but it's that basic

00:03:02.790 --> 00:03:07.580 
to the original but it's that basic
original<00:03:03.660> Famicom<00:03:04.020> look<00:03:06.260> really<00:03:07.260> nice<00:03:07.380> little

00:03:07.580 --> 00:03:07.590 
original Famicom look really nice little

00:03:07.590 --> 00:03:10.310 
original Famicom look really nice little
machine<00:03:07.800> all<00:03:08.340> together<00:03:08.900> and<00:03:09.900> what<00:03:10.020> was<00:03:10.170> really

00:03:10.310 --> 00:03:10.320 
machine all together and what was really

00:03:10.320 --> 00:03:14.320 
machine all together and what was really
interesting<00:03:10.910> at<00:03:11.910> America<00:03:12.300> we<00:03:12.390> had<00:03:12.510> an<00:03:12.600> NES<00:03:12.990> one

00:03:14.320 --> 00:03:14.330 
interesting at America we had an NES one

00:03:14.330 --> 00:03:18.020 
interesting at America we had an NES one
and<00:03:15.380> then<00:03:16.380> we<00:03:16.470> got<00:03:16.620> the<00:03:16.830> basically<00:03:17.550> the<00:03:17.700> black

00:03:18.020 --> 00:03:18.030
