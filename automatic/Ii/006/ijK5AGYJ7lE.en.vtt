00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:26.229 
new phone and all the capability that we
app<00:02:23.569> we<00:02:24.379> needed<00:02:24.680> to<00:02:24.799> manage<00:02:25.040> space<00:02:25.579> inside<00:02:26.000> the

app we needed to manage space inside the
phone<00:02:26.450> very<00:02:26.930> carefully<00:02:27.530> we've<00:02:28.129> created<00:02:28.489> the

00:02:28.839 --> 00:02:28.849 
phone very carefully we've created the

00:02:28.849 --> 00:02:31.089 
phone very carefully we've created the
new<00:02:29.030> much<00:02:29.540> smaller<00:02:29.959> lightning<00:02:30.620> connector

00:02:31.089 --> 00:02:31.099

new much smaller lightning connector
it's<00:02:31.609> all<00:02:31.879> digital<00:02:32.120> so<00:02:32.780> it's<00:02:32.989> designed<00:02:33.409> for

00:02:33.550 --> 00:02:33.560 
it's all digital so it's designed for

00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:36.280 
it's all digital so it's designed for
today's<00:02:33.950> uses<00:02:34.459> and<00:02:34.700> we<00:02:35.390> made<00:02:35.599> it<00:02:35.719> reversible

00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:36.290 
today's uses and we made it reversible

00:02:36.290 --> 00:02:40.000 
today's uses and we made it reversible
so<00:02:36.709> it<00:02:36.859> fits<00:02:37.099> either<00:02:37.340> way<00:02:38.140> we<00:02:39.140> also<00:02:39.319> move<00:02:39.739> to<00:02:39.980> a

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:40.010 
so it fits either way we also move to a

00:02:40.010 --> 00:02:42.819 
so it fits either way we also move to a
