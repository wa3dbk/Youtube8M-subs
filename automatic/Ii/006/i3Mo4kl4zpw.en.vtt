00:00:09.559 --> 00:00:14.520
 good guys this week microsoft 

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:16.830
 launched its office productivity suite 

00:00:14.520 --> 00:00:18.570
 for ipad a suite that is divided into 

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:21.180
 several applications and they carry 

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:24.180
 popular applications like word excel or 

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:26.130
 powerpoint to apple tablet some 

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:29.100
 readers asked us if there would be 

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:31.620
 also an office for android and you know 

00:00:29.100 --> 00:00:34.620
 Yes, there is something, although not exactly 

00:00:31.620 --> 00:00:36.719
 as presented to them office 

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:38.910
 mobile for android is the application that 

00:00:36.719 --> 00:00:41.120
 Microsoft has put to download by the 

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:43.380
 moment on the google platform 

00:00:41.120 --> 00:00:45.690
 emphasize that it is not even in the 

00:00:43.380 --> 00:00:48.150
 same version that has been released for ipad 

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:51.090
 since as its name indicates it is more 

00:00:48.150 --> 00:00:54.180
 well a port focused on mobile that yes 

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:56.310
 it's free office for android engloba 

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:58.559
 in the same application options 

00:00:56.310 --> 00:01:00.930
 visualization edition and creation of 

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:03.180
 word excel and power point files 

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:04.890
 entering the program we will have a 

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:07.229
 document history summary 

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:09.659
 open in addition to some tabs from 

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:12.020
 which we can access to our account 

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:14.450
 in one drive the old sky 

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:17.090
 as we said we can create a document 

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:19.789
 of word or excel from scratch or simply 

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:21.590
 open existing documents of these two 

00:01:19.789 --> 00:01:23.689
 tools or powerpoint 

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:25.759
 It should be noted that that being office for 

00:01:23.689 --> 00:01:27.679
 Android keeps the format of the 

00:01:25.759 --> 00:01:29.689
 files as we have created it in 

00:01:27.679 --> 00:01:32.390
 the computer the options it gives us 

00:01:29.689 --> 00:01:34.280
 for layout are rather scarce what 

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:36.619
 same thing happens with an excel where although 

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:38.840
 we can write and change formulas or 

00:01:36.619 --> 00:01:40.459
 include some graphs we follow 

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:43.219
 having shortcomings when creating 

00:01:40.459 --> 00:01:45.679
 contents from scratch and much worse is 

00:01:43.219 --> 00:01:47.119
 everything related to power point and 

00:01:45.679 --> 00:01:50.750
 that we can open files 

00:01:47.119 --> 00:01:53.119
 existing and modify the text nothing of 

00:01:50.750 --> 00:01:54.860
 new modules in short for which 

00:01:53.119 --> 00:01:56.689
 wants to download to office for android 

00:01:54.860 --> 00:01:58.970
 say that this application is intended 

00:01:56.689 --> 00:02:01.549
 for those who want a processor 

00:01:58.970 --> 00:02:03.649
 decent texts for your mobile or what 

00:02:01.549 --> 00:02:05.929
 I think it 's more accurate for those who 

00:02:03.649 --> 00:02:08.299
 they need to touch up some data of a 

00:02:05.929 --> 00:02:11.619
 document when they are not in front of the 

00:02:08.299 --> 00:02:11.619
 computer nothing more
