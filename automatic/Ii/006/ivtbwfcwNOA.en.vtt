00:00:05.370 --> 00:00:11.170
 hi the nuggets at the port of 

00:00:08.320 --> 00:00:14.289
 everything so here is the second part of the 

00:00:11.170 --> 00:00:15.820
 4 x 4 tutorial so in the second 

00:00:14.289 --> 00:00:19.660
 part i show you how to solve 

00:00:15.820 --> 00:00:21.220
 the edges of the iv arcade so in fact 

00:00:19.660 --> 00:00:23.400
 it's done that for francs a ridge at 

00:00:21.220 --> 00:00:26.320
 chance so there for example yellow orange 

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:30.279
 we bring back the second yellow stop 

00:00:26.320 --> 00:00:33.250
 orange next here and we apply a 

00:00:30.279 --> 00:00:36.280
 algorithm that will bring together the two edges 

00:00:33.250 --> 00:00:38.440
 and did this eagle this algorithm the 

00:00:36.280 --> 00:00:41.410
 repeat until you get all the edges 

00:00:38.440 --> 00:00:42.899
 of solved so I showed you so we 

00:00:41.410 --> 00:00:45.039
 looking for the hatch stops yellow-orange 

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:46.239
 so the lily and I do not recognize you 

00:00:45.039 --> 00:00:49.420
 need so I actually put on the 

00:00:46.239 --> 00:00:51.180
 duo face here i 'm going inverted with 

00:00:49.420 --> 00:00:54.010
 this one so I go up 

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:57.730
 they stop that I removed game but 

00:00:54.010 --> 00:00:59.550
 the one that I handle sounds like that 

00:00:57.730 --> 00:01:04.600
 in less breaking all two good 

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:10.000
 I apply despite having the wrf 

00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:12.490
 months later - mdw me and I see that 

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:15.850
 it solved my art is and I do 

00:01:12.490 --> 00:01:18.460
 same with all the others so there I 

00:01:15.850 --> 00:01:22.470
 see I'm lucky without it 

00:01:18.460 --> 00:01:22.470
 before term in 2g not done on purpose 

00:01:22.689 --> 00:01:28.540
 so the joy that I have the green rose lot 

00:01:25.810 --> 00:01:30.100
 of osteoarthritis go here so for the 

00:01:28.540 --> 00:01:34.000
 put the world 

00:01:30.100 --> 00:01:35.680
 it's gnawed back down sam raimi there the 

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:40.390
 two rosÃ©s are good it's on the top 

00:01:35.680 --> 00:01:49.600
 so i apply loved the months wrf 

00:01:40.390 --> 00:01:51.430
 could I do it ftw - ella blue white he 

00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:56.049
 is welded not good but like everything to 

00:01:51.430 --> 00:02:02.110
 the time in the world but changes on 

00:01:56.049 --> 00:02:04.530
 mongori the green ag yellow I was looking for 

00:02:02.110 --> 00:02:04.530
 money 

00:02:07.289 --> 00:02:28.030
 but just avoid there I come back 

00:02:18.130 --> 00:02:35.350
 white is here so on the world of w 

00:02:28.030 --> 00:02:43.750
 is super me the idea w - let him 

00:02:35.350 --> 00:02:48.940
 document makes rare the senses the rose of the 

00:02:43.750 --> 00:02:57.160
 yellow and the missions last world feels 

00:02:48.940 --> 00:02:58.959
 good here are the Arabs are finished so 

00:02:57.160 --> 00:03:01.000
 once they stop without doing anything 

00:02:58.959 --> 00:03:03.450
 solves as a rubik's being at x 3 

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:08.260
 normal ie the cei 2 stops 

00:03:03.450 --> 00:03:14.070
 the summers at a normal edge of 3 x 

00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:14.070
 3 so we want 

00:04:02.540 --> 00:04:07.410
 so here we see that I have a parity 

00:04:05.220 --> 00:04:10.020
 so there he had reviewed parity and I 

00:04:07.410 --> 00:04:15.470
 will show you in the next video 

00:04:10.020 --> 00:04:15.470
 how to solve the parities of which paul 

00:04:34.520 --> 00:04:38.910
 the 4 x 4 and so ends the next 

00:04:37.500 --> 00:04:40.520
 video as I said I'll show you 

00:04:38.910 --> 00:04:43.520
 how to summarize history in paris head 

00:04:40.520 --> 00:04:43.520
 here
