reverse-engineered from an app that was

00:03:38.500 --> 00:03:40.680 
reverse-engineered from an app that was
owned<00:03:38.709> by<00:03:38.830> a<00:03:39.010> very<00:03:39.250> famous<00:03:39.489> guitar<00:03:40.480> player

00:03:42.660 --> 00:03:42.670 
from Austin Texas so maybe you can

00:03:42.670 --> 00:03:44.490 
from Austin Texas so maybe you can
figure<00:03:42.820> out<00:03:42.910> who<00:03:43.030> that<00:03:43.060> is<00:03:43.360> by<00:03:43.600> looking<00:03:44.170> into

00:03:50.009 --> 00:03:50.019 
coming out that has 40 el84 is in it

00:03:50.019 --> 00:03:51.479 
coming out that has 40 el84 is in it
it's<00:03:50.320> a<00:03:50.350> very<00:03:50.530> different<00:03:50.980> very<00:03:51.370> different

it's a very different very different

00:03:51.489 --> 00:03:53.220 
it's a very different very different
amplifier<00:03:52.030> with<00:03:52.180> a<00:03:52.209> lot<00:03:52.330> of<00:03:52.360> British<00:03:52.690> charm<00:03:53.050> to

00:03:53.220 --> 00:03:53.230
