00:00:03.740 --> 00:00:12.150
 in a pan put the slices of 

00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:16.350
 bacon you can add a small 

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:20.160
 this city sayah the bacon bits 

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:22.710
 secret we see them remove from the fire you 

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:25.710
 can the sponges and it will remove the cra 

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:26.970
 and it will become a side issue so 

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:29.960
 does it using a paper se 

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:34.860
 know in the same pan 

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:37.469
 we see you because again greece and 

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:45.210
 oil so to bacon leaps we go 

00:00:37.469 --> 00:00:48.930
 fry the onions and you can 

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:51.410
 also add some comers who are 

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:51.410
 already taken 

00:00:53.310 --> 00:00:58.110
 onions are fresh you can 

00:00:55.680 --> 00:01:00.600
 also put on the a6 while 

00:00:58.110 --> 00:01:03.949
 the onions are screaming you 

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:07.800
 can cut lateral as usual 

00:01:03.949 --> 00:01:08.910
 we leave the town hall then leave them 

00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:11.400
 pieces of chicken from the freezer 

00:01:08.910 --> 00:01:14.280
 was starting from the psy and wanting 

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:24.390
 fool a shot into the water and into 

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:27.479
 the egg then in the breadcrumbs we see 

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:31.340
 move on now to cooking the chicken 

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:35.280
 so for that you take a piece 

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:39.619
 then funds frozen in the oil for 

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:42.180
 about 5 to 6 minutes 

00:01:39.619 --> 00:01:44.130
 it all depends on the thickness of the piece 

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:47.430
 as here is the face to this raz between 

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:50.009
 five and six minutes if not a little more the 

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:53.220
 chicken is run away frozen put on paper 

00:01:50.009 --> 00:01:57.840
 sopalin to remove the excess of 

00:01:53.220 --> 00:02:00.630
 fat now put back to heat 

00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:04.200
 what you need for a burger so 

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:07.610
 a few onions and slices of 

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:12.270
 bikes and at the same time open the bread 

00:02:07.610 --> 00:02:13.290
 in two and do the test and we will 

00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:16.050
 pass now 

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:17.520
 high of the wise of the burger so what 

00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:19.260
 you hear it's precisely the 

00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:22.370
 onions that are still in the process of 

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:27.630
 joke sending for that you take 

00:02:22.370 --> 00:02:28.920
 our good it's not google for 

00:02:27.630 --> 00:02:31.890
 people who do not know this is called 

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:33.480
 humble this so normally at mcdo he 

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:35.500
 directly lay the piece of chicken 

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:38.700
 on it but we are 

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:42.250
 mistake then we can put a little 

00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:46.830
 spoon or more depending on the tips 

00:02:42.250 --> 00:02:51.910
 of voice sauce we and tend well 

00:02:46.830 --> 00:02:58.650
 then the piece of chicken like those 

00:02:51.910 --> 00:03:03.990
 then the slice of cheese next 

00:02:58.650 --> 00:03:03.990
 put a little onions grilled 

00:03:14.290 --> 00:03:17.010
 like this 

00:03:21.890 --> 00:03:29.730
 then the big guns come to see you 

00:03:28.350 --> 00:03:31.980
 can put more one month I do 

00:03:29.730 --> 00:03:35.220
 like that yes I try to make 

00:03:31.980 --> 00:03:39.209
 respect the recipe as much as possible then 

00:03:35.220 --> 00:03:48.120
 then take the boy's top then 

00:03:39.209 --> 00:03:50.330
 add a spoon of sauce and go 

00:03:48.120 --> 00:03:50.330
 well 

00:03:57.620 --> 00:04:08.260
 then to finish sheets of 

00:04:02.030 --> 00:04:12.890
 salad that we cut before like these 

00:04:08.260 --> 00:04:17.090
 and you just have to train the 

00:04:12.890 --> 00:04:19.359
 burger so it's very simple you 

00:04:17.090 --> 00:04:23.630
 put like this country 

00:04:19.359 --> 00:04:26.449
 and that's it and the surplus that is in b you 

00:04:23.630 --> 00:04:33.410
 remove it see something good 

00:04:26.449 --> 00:04:36.650
 pretty that's it the cbo is over so 

00:04:33.410 --> 00:04:40.100
 I'm trying to show you a little bit 

00:04:36.650 --> 00:04:44.270
 hiding here we have a really good 

00:04:40.100 --> 00:04:47.780
 sandwich sandwich are very very very 

00:04:44.270 --> 00:04:49.520
 very good here I hope I am 

00:04:47.780 --> 00:04:51.830
 arrived to meet your expectations 

00:04:49.520 --> 00:04:53.930
 and I'm already tasted I'm talking where 

00:04:51.830 --> 00:04:55.070
 you're here but I'm already tasted I can 

00:04:53.930 --> 00:04:57.289
 to tell you what I prefer is that 

00:04:55.070 --> 00:04:59.449
 it's a real chicken fillet 

00:04:57.289 --> 00:05:01.610
 really meat is not something 

00:04:59.449 --> 00:05:03.650
 restore thing so I find that 

00:05:01.610 --> 00:05:05.570
 really great so as usual 

00:05:03.650 --> 00:05:06.950
 in the comments really do not hesitate 

00:05:05.570 --> 00:05:08.720
 not to ask for your recipes 

00:05:06.950 --> 00:05:09.860
 after it's true we wonder that 

00:05:08.720 --> 00:05:12.710
 are showing all sorts of 

00:05:09.860 --> 00:05:13.880
 sandwiches of 22 2 clicks finally it's 

00:05:12.710 --> 00:05:15.440
 really long 

00:05:13.880 --> 00:05:17.410
 so I do not think I'd get to 

00:05:15.440 --> 00:05:19.729
 do everything but I will try to do the 

00:05:17.410 --> 00:05:22.240
