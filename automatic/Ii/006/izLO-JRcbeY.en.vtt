00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.380
 I like to do cake pops today 

00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:07.170
 just easter edition is if the best 

00:00:04.380 --> 00:00:09.269
 cake pops ewer it gets really delicious 

00:00:07.170 --> 00:00:10.769
 and the hottest is you need it 

00:00:09.269 --> 00:00:17.960
 not much ingredients and we have to 

00:00:10.769 --> 00:00:23.400
 do not pack we need we need 

00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:27.630
 we need creative decoration bouquets 

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:29.039
 and, of course, still strong first 

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:31.699
 we take the finished cake a bit 

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:31.699
 make small 

00:00:38.230 --> 00:00:42.680
 to get the whole thing to a mass 

00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:52.640
 We do a bit of jam purely 

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:54.140
 and stir it all together like that 

00:00:52.640 --> 00:00:56.120
 now have the finished mass and the 

00:00:54.140 --> 00:00:58.690
 we shape matching easter in new 

00:00:56.120 --> 00:00:58.690
 shape 

00:01:01.300 --> 00:01:05.120
 I've already shaped and shaped five eggs 

00:01:03.830 --> 00:01:06.229
 They have to be in the refrigerator 

00:01:05.120 --> 00:01:09.140
 cool off a bit 

00:01:06.229 --> 00:01:13.729
 and I've been really relish it the 

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:15.050
 namely smell very delicious while the 

00:01:13.729 --> 00:01:17.210
 eggs in the fridge a bit 

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:19.940
 I already prepare the dÃ©co cool 

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:21.979
 So before the couverture ladies once 

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:24.680
 for me and a light chocolate with it 

00:01:21.979 --> 00:01:26.420
 nice and for and you can do that in 

00:01:24.680 --> 00:01:28.479
 were water bath or in the 

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:28.479
 microwave 

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:39.810
 should have finished again the scarce 

00:01:43.800 --> 00:01:49.780
 Anniversary that now nicely liquid the eggs 

00:01:46.420 --> 00:01:51.580
 are pretty tight and i really have so 

00:01:49.780 --> 00:01:55.180
 I mean deco and now comes the 

00:01:51.580 --> 00:02:00.660
 bull in the cake pops and then that will be 

00:01:55.180 --> 00:02:00.660
 Everything is beautifully decorated 

00:02:24.130 --> 00:02:34.520
 styrofoam documents and super fast 

00:02:32.240 --> 00:02:35.900
 super simple they look great 

00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:37.370
 Now they can take off a bit 

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:39.860
 and then you can enjoy them i hope 

00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:42.170

00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:45.610
 post down picture and if you like 

00:02:42.170 --> 00:02:45.610
 then has a name up 

00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:54.080
 what happens now is the stand 

00:02:52.250 --> 00:02:58.420
 a bit sucked because of the 

00:02:54.080 --> 00:02:58.420
 mass is still a bit too wobbly
