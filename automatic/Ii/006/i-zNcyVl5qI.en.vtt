think<00:02:05.850> we<00:02:06.270> can<00:02:06.420> walk<00:02:06.689> away<00:02:06.990> with<00:02:07.409> a

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:07.950 
think we can walk away with a

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:10.339 
think we can walk away with a
comfortable<00:02:08.520> way<00:02:08.879> out<00:02:09.179> of<00:02:09.390> this<00:02:09.539> group<00:02:09.810> and<00:02:10.200> we

00:02:10.339 --> 00:02:10.349 
comfortable way out of this group and we

00:02:10.349 --> 00:02:11.780 
comfortable way out of this group and we
actually<00:02:10.500> get<00:02:10.800> a<00:02:10.830> bit<00:02:11.039> of<00:02:11.160> look<00:02:11.310> here<00:02:11.610> with<00:02:11.760> a

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:11.790 
actually get a bit of look here with a

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:13.080 
actually get a bit of look here with a

00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:51.040 
the faq on it it seems to deceive the

00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:52.890 
the faq on it it seems to deceive the
goalkeeper<00:02:51.640> more<00:02:51.849> often<00:02:52.209> than<00:02:52.360> not<00:02:52.420> and

00:02:52.890 --> 00:02:52.900 
goalkeeper more often than not and

00:02:52.900 --> 00:02:54.930 
goalkeeper more often than not and
straight<00:02:53.349> from<00:02:53.560> kickoff<00:02:53.769> in<00:02:54.310> the<00:02:54.430> second<00:02:54.760> half

00:02:54.930 --> 00:02:54.940 
straight from kickoff in the second half

straight from kickoff in the second half
their<00:02:55.450> defense<00:02:55.690> makes<00:02:56.230> a<00:02:56.530> massive<00:02:56.980> error<00:02:57.430> and

00:02:57.809 --> 00:02:57.819 
their defense makes a massive error and

00:02:57.819 --> 00:02:59.640 
their defense makes a massive error and
lewandowski's<00:02:58.540> there<00:02:58.750> to<00:02:58.930> pounce<00:02:59.110> and<00:02:59.410> score

00:02:59.640 --> 00:02:59.650 
lewandowski's there to pounce and score

00:02:59.650 --> 00:03:01.770 
lewandowski's there to pounce and score
an<00:02:59.769> absolutely<00:03:00.370> awesome<00:03:00.670> long<00:03:01.269> shot<00:03:01.569> and

00:03:01.770 --> 00:03:01.780 
an absolutely awesome long shot and

00:03:01.780 --> 00:03:04.500 
an absolutely awesome long shot and
there<00:03:02.590> seems<00:03:02.860> to<00:03:03.010> go<00:03:03.190> in<00:03:03.370> a<00:03:03.610> hell<00:03:04.000> of<00:03:04.030> a<00:03:04.180> lot<00:03:04.329> and

00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:04.510 
there seems to go in a hell of a lot and

00:03:04.510 --> 00:03:06.539 
there seems to go in a hell of a lot and
I<00:03:04.660> like<00:03:05.049> the<00:03:05.349> style<00:03:05.530> of<00:03:05.650> long<00:03:05.829> shot<00:03:06.069> not<00:03:06.459> only

00:03:06.539 --> 00:03:06.549 
I like the style of long shot not only

00:03:06.549 --> 00:03:08.220 
I like the style of long shot not only
because<00:03:06.700> it's<00:03:06.970> very<00:03:07.150> similar<00:03:07.450> to<00:03:07.599> how<00:03:07.870> where

00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:08.230 
because it's very similar to how where

00:03:08.230 --> 00:03:10.440 
because it's very similar to how where

00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:10.450 
the shots on fee for work but just

00:03:10.450 --> 00:03:12.089 
the shots on fee for work but just

00:03:12.089 --> 00:03:12.099 
because they seem to fly in with

00:03:12.099 --> 00:03:14.069 
because they seem to fly in with
absolute<00:03:12.790> power<00:03:13.090> and<00:03:13.420> the<00:03:13.510> keeper<00:03:13.870> gets

00:03:14.069 --> 00:03:14.079 
absolute power and the keeper gets

00:03:14.079 --> 00:03:16.020 
absolute power and the keeper gets
absolutely<00:03:14.560> no<00:03:14.739> chance<00:03:14.920> basically<00:03:15.640> scoring<00:03:15.970> a

00:05:42.960 --> 00:05:42.970 
I'm gonna say that is because of the

00:05:42.970 --> 00:05:44.550 
I'm gonna say that is because of the
obvious<00:05:43.180> fact<00:05:43.660> that<00:05:43.870> i've<00:05:43.960> only<00:05:44.110> played<00:05:44.200> with

00:05:44.550 --> 00:05:44.560 
obvious fact that i've only played with

00:05:44.560 --> 00:05:46.440 
obvious fact that i've only played with
Bayern<00:05:44.830> Munich<00:05:45.130> but<00:05:45.250> he<00:05:45.340> is<00:05:45.490> good<00:05:45.700> he's<00:05:46.030> a<00:05:46.060> tidy

00:05:46.440 --> 00:05:46.450 
Bayern Munich but he is good he's a tidy

00:05:46.450 --> 00:05:48.390 
Bayern Munich but he is good he's a tidy
little<00:05:46.570> player<00:05:46.990> as<00:05:47.230> well<00:05:47.500> but<00:05:48.010> the<00:05:48.130> buying

00:05:48.390 --> 00:05:48.400 
little player as well but the buying

00:05:48.400 --> 00:05:50.340 
little player as well but the buying
team<00:05:48.430> itself<00:05:49.030> seems<00:05:49.360> to<00:05:49.510> be<00:05:49.600> perfect<00:05:50.140> all

00:05:50.340 --> 00:05:50.350 
team itself seems to be perfect all

00:05:50.350 --> 00:05:52.080 
team itself seems to be perfect all
around<00:05:50.380> not<00:05:50.800> only<00:05:50.830> in<00:05:51.100> defense<00:05:51.460> midfield<00:05:51.850> and

00:05:52.080 --> 00:05:52.090 
around not only in defense midfield and

00:05:52.090 --> 00:05:54.510 
around not only in defense midfield and
attack<00:05:52.420> and<00:05:53.020> the<00:05:53.770> fact<00:05:53.950> I've<00:05:54.070> not<00:05:54.190> used<00:05:54.310> any

00:05:54.510 --> 00:05:54.520 
attack and the fact I've not used any

00:05:54.520 --> 00:05:56.130 
attack and the fact I've not used any
other<00:05:54.610> teams<00:05:55.000> bet<00:05:55.330> real<00:05:55.510> madrid<00:05:55.720> of<00:05:55.840> that<00:05:55.930> good
