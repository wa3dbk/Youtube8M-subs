00:05:01.720 --> 00:05:01.730 
where I explain jewelry metal standards

00:05:01.730 --> 00:05:03.610 
where I explain jewelry metal standards
then<00:05:02.150> you<00:05:02.270> already<00:05:02.630> know<00:05:02.810> that<00:05:02.840> these

00:05:03.610 --> 00:05:03.620 
then you already know that these

00:05:03.620 --> 00:05:06.030 
then you already know that these
barbells<00:05:04.190> are<00:05:04.430> an<00:05:04.610> implant<00:05:05.060> grade<00:05:05.390> titanium

barbells are an implant grade titanium

00:05:06.040 --> 00:05:08.890 
barbells are an implant grade titanium
we<00:05:07.040> like<00:05:07.220> to<00:05:07.340> use<00:05:07.460> titanium<00:05:08.150> as<00:05:08.390> our<00:05:08.540> minimum

00:05:08.890 --> 00:05:08.900 
we like to use titanium as our minimum

00:05:08.900 --> 00:05:11.020 
we like to use titanium as our minimum
standard<00:05:09.410> instead<00:05:09.770> of<00:05:09.860> steel<00:05:10.130> because<00:05:10.610> it<00:05:10.910> is

00:05:11.020 --> 00:05:11.030 
standard instead of steel because it is

00:05:11.030 --> 00:05:13.390 
standard instead of steel because it is
a<00:05:11.060> little<00:05:11.390> bit<00:05:11.750> lighter<00:05:12.080> it<00:05:12.890> has<00:05:13.130> less

00:05:13.390 --> 00:05:13.400 
a little bit lighter it has less

00:05:13.400 --> 00:05:15.250 
a little bit lighter it has less
impurities<00:05:14.030> like<00:05:14.210> nickel<00:05:14.720> which<00:05:14.930> can<00:05:15.170> be

00:05:15.250 --> 00:05:15.260 
impurities like nickel which can be

00:05:15.260 --> 00:05:17.410 
impurities like nickel which can be
extreme<00:05:15.770> sensitizers<00:05:16.580> causing<00:05:17.150> irritation

00:05:17.410 --> 00:05:17.420 
extreme sensitizers causing irritation

00:05:17.420 --> 00:05:21.640 
extreme sensitizers causing irritation
with<00:05:17.930> a<00:05:17.960> lot<00:05:18.170> of<00:05:18.200> people<00:05:20.050> and<00:05:21.050> it<00:05:21.380> has<00:05:21.500> the

00:05:21.640 --> 00:05:21.650 
with a lot of people and it has the

00:05:21.650 --> 00:05:23.620 
with a lot of people and it has the
ability<00:05:21.740> to<00:05:22.190> be<00:05:22.310> anodized<00:05:22.850> meaning<00:05:23.450> if<00:05:23.600> we

00:05:23.620 --> 00:05:23.630 
ability to be anodized meaning if we

00:05:23.630 --> 00:05:28.180 
ability to be anodized meaning if we
wanted<00:05:24.020> to<00:05:24.080> we<00:05:24.530> could<00:05:25.600> use<00:05:26.600> a<00:05:26.920> electric<00:05:27.920> bath

00:05:28.180 --> 00:05:28.190 
wanted to we could use a electric bath

00:05:28.190 --> 00:05:31.540 
wanted to we could use a electric bath
process<00:05:28.850> and<00:05:29.090> change<00:05:29.360> the<00:05:30.250> oxide<00:05:31.250> layer<00:05:31.520> which

00:05:31.540 --> 00:05:31.550 
process and change the oxide layer which

00:05:31.550 --> 00:05:33.970 
process and change the oxide layer which
reflects<00:05:32.330> the<00:05:32.480> light<00:05:33.050> in<00:05:33.320> different<00:05:33.680> colors

00:05:33.970 --> 00:05:33.980 
reflects the light in different colors

00:05:33.980 --> 00:05:35.950 
reflects the light in different colors
so<00:05:34.460> we<00:05:34.580> could<00:05:34.730> essentially<00:05:35.060> make<00:05:35.360> the<00:05:35.510> metal

00:05:35.950 --> 00:05:35.960 
so we could essentially make the metal

00:05:35.960 --> 00:05:38.050 
so we could essentially make the metal
have<00:05:36.440> a<00:05:36.470> different<00:05:36.920> color

00:05:38.050 --> 00:05:38.060 
have a different color

00:05:38.060 --> 00:05:41.050 
have a different color
