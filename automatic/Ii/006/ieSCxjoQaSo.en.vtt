00:04:24.210 --> 00:04:24.220 
easy enough to take away a limb and

00:04:24.220 --> 00:04:26.790 
easy enough to take away a limb and
again<00:04:24.760> after<00:04:25.270> that<00:04:25.449> dose<00:04:25.840> of<00:04:26.080> creepiness<00:04:26.470> it

00:04:26.790 --> 00:04:26.800

00:05:06.880 --> 00:05:09.840 
irritates me it's not that I don't get
it<00:05:07.060> I<00:05:07.270> get<00:05:07.570> it<00:05:07.870> I<00:05:08.229> see<00:05:08.500> that<00:05:08.680> it<00:05:08.770> says<00:05:08.979> elite<00:05:09.490> and

00:05:09.840 --> 00:05:09.850 
it I get it I see that it says elite and

00:05:09.850 --> 00:05:12.420 
it I get it I see that it says elite and
it's<00:05:10.030> the<00:05:10.300> exact<00:05:10.690> same<00:05:10.720> thing<00:05:11.410> but<00:05:11.650> flipped

00:05:12.420 --> 00:05:12.430 
it's the exact same thing but flipped

00:05:12.430 --> 00:05:16.409 
it's the exact same thing but flipped
and<00:05:12.820> I<00:05:13.169> just<00:05:14.169> I<00:05:14.320> just<00:05:14.380> don't<00:05:15.010> like<00:05:15.340> it<00:05:15.639> also<00:05:16.150> and

00:05:16.409 --> 00:05:16.419 
and I just I just don't like it also and

00:05:16.419 --> 00:05:17.219 
and I just I just don't like it also and
I<00:05:16.479> thought<00:05:16.599> that<00:05:16.660> this<00:05:16.840> was<00:05:16.990> really

00:05:17.219 --> 00:05:17.229 
I thought that this was really

00:05:17.229 --> 00:05:19.110 
I thought that this was really
interesting<00:05:17.620> did<00:05:17.770> you<00:05:17.860> guys<00:05:18.070> know<00:05:18.310> that<00:05:18.550> there

everybody is going to be exploding over

00:05:53.620 --> 00:05:54.990 
everybody is going to be exploding over
it's<00:05:54.010> kind<00:05:54.160> of<00:05:54.280> an<00:05:54.400> opportunity<00:05:54.580> that<00:05:54.880> you

00:05:54.990 --> 00:05:55.000 
it's kind of an opportunity that you

00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:57.570 
it's kind of an opportunity that you
can't<00:05:55.270> pass<00:05:55.479> up<00:05:55.510> although<00:05:56.260> I'm<00:05:56.590> wondering

00:05:57.570 --> 00:05:57.580 
can't pass up although I'm wondering

00:05:57.580 --> 00:05:59.490 
can't pass up although I'm wondering
since<00:05:57.940> they<00:05:58.150> already<00:05:58.360> have<00:05:58.630> like<00:05:58.780> a<00:05:58.810> prototype

00:05:59.490 --> 00:05:59.500 
since they already have like a prototype

00:05:59.500 --> 00:06:01.110 
since they already have like a prototype
and<00:05:59.680> stuff<00:05:59.889> maybe<00:06:00.099> someday<00:06:00.550> it'll<00:06:00.669> come<00:06:00.940> out

00:06:01.110 --> 00:06:01.120 
and stuff maybe someday it'll come out

00:06:01.120 --> 00:06:02.279 
and stuff maybe someday it'll come out
maybe<00:06:01.330> it's<00:06:01.570> something<00:06:01.750> that<00:06:02.020> they<00:06:02.139> will

00:06:02.279 --> 00:06:02.289 
maybe it's something that they will

00:06:02.289 --> 00:06:04.620 
maybe it's something that they will
focus<00:06:02.500> on<00:06:02.740> again<00:06:03.070> once<00:06:03.849> they<00:06:04.060> you<00:06:04.120> know<00:06:04.270> how

00:06:04.620 --> 00:06:04.630 
focus on again once they you know how

00:06:04.630 --> 00:06:07.230 
focus on again once they you know how
they<00:06:04.780> have<00:06:05.020> a<00:06:05.169> brief<00:06:05.710> reprieve<00:06:06.310> it<00:06:06.910> might<00:06:07.090> just

00:06:07.230 --> 00:06:07.240 
they have a brief reprieve it might just

00:06:07.240 --> 00:06:09.000 
they have a brief reprieve it might just
scrap<00:06:07.510> it<00:06:07.599> all<00:06:07.840> together<00:06:08.020> it's<00:06:08.590> hard<00:06:08.740> to<00:06:08.770> say

00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:09.010 
scrap it all together it's hard to say

00:06:09.010 --> 00:06:10.890 
scrap it all together it's hard to say
but<00:06:09.340> I<00:06:09.610> would<00:06:09.789> like<00:06:09.940> to<00:06:09.970> see<00:06:10.270> it<00:06:10.360> at<00:06:10.449> least<00:06:10.570> hit

00:06:10.890 --> 00:06:10.900 
but I would like to see it at least hit

00:06:10.900 --> 00:06:13.230 
but I would like to see it at least hit
like<00:06:11.260> a<00:06:11.289> focus<00:06:11.710> group<00:06:11.740> of<00:06:12.010> some<00:06:12.190> sort<00:06:12.430> to<00:06:12.639> see

00:06:13.230 --> 00:06:13.240 
like a focus group of some sort to see

00:06:13.240 --> 00:06:14.550
