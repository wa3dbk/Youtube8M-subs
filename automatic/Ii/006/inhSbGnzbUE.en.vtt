00:04:09.800 --> 00:04:09.810 
type any number you want this is a seed

00:04:09.810 --> 00:04:12.050 
type any number you want this is a seed
the<00:04:10.500> seed<00:04:10.530> is<00:04:11.040> a<00:04:11.070> number<00:04:11.460> that<00:04:11.490> tells<00:04:11.880> a

00:04:12.050 --> 00:04:12.060 
the seed is a number that tells a

00:04:12.060 --> 00:04:14.180 
the seed is a number that tells a
computer<00:04:12.480> how<00:04:12.720> to<00:04:12.750> randomly<00:04:13.680> generate

00:04:14.180 --> 00:04:14.190 
computer how to randomly generate

00:04:14.190 --> 00:04:17.150 
computer how to randomly generate
something<00:04:14.540> so<00:04:15.560> you<00:04:16.560> just<00:04:16.710> have<00:04:16.890> to<00:04:17.010> use<00:04:17.130> a

00:04:17.150 --> 00:04:17.160 
something so you just have to use a

00:04:17.160 --> 00:04:18.560 
something so you just have to use a
different<00:04:17.280> seed<00:04:17.790> if<00:04:18.030> you<00:04:18.150> want<00:04:18.330> a<00:04:18.390> different

00:04:18.560 --> 00:04:18.570 
different seed if you want a different

00:04:18.570 --> 00:04:21.050 
different seed if you want a different
dungeon<00:04:19.049> so<00:04:19.230> 2<00:04:19.290> 3<00:04:19.830> 4<00:04:20.040> 5<00:04:20.280> that's<00:04:20.549> going<00:04:20.790> to<00:04:20.850> be<00:04:20.940> my

00:04:21.050 --> 00:04:21.060 
dungeon so 2 3 4 5 that's going to be my

00:04:21.060 --> 00:04:24.290 
dungeon so 2 3 4 5 that's going to be my
number<00:04:21.330> I'll<00:04:21.630> hit<00:04:21.840> enter<00:04:22.109> and<00:04:23.030> that<00:04:24.030> will

00:04:24.290 --> 00:04:24.300 
number I'll hit enter and that will

00:04:24.300 --> 00:04:31.170 
number I'll hit enter and that will
generate<00:04:25.070> the<00:04:26.070> same<00:04:26.280> dungeon<00:04:26.760> but<00:04:27.090> different

00:04:31.170 --> 00:04:31.180 

00:04:31.180 --> 00:04:33.879
