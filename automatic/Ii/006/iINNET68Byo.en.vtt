 hi guys in this tutorial i want 

00:00:02.939 --> 00:00:07.140
 show how to have more memory 

00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:12.090
 internal for samsung galaxy next though 

00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:14.790
 first of all we have to go there 

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:19.350
 we have to ask about space tour of 

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:22.590
 download this program here for a moment 

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:24.000
 linked usd remember that to do so 

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:28.740
 you need real root permissions 

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:31.949
 for those who did not know what had happened 

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:34.280
 in my channel and I made a video of 

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:38.309
 what is it like to make a course 

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:41.809
 let's start once we download links 

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:50.660
 of directly free of the pri store 

00:00:41.809 --> 00:00:54.899
 let's go inside for example now 

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:59.340
 there is whatsapp in my phone see 

00:00:54.899 --> 00:01:05.000
 then whatsapp in the internal area of the 

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:10.650
 phone and lesson settings 

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:14.360
 prestige that now as a memory 

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:18.330
 internal we will have here we do not see well though 

00:01:14.360 --> 00:01:24.890
 at 37 megabytes and free but if now 

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:24.890
 I go to sd 

00:01:28.510 --> 00:01:42.050
 I put too much exposed sd cards there 

00:01:36.610 --> 00:01:45.040
 i'm okay to look if you haven't broken 

00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:45.040
 you can't do it 

00:01:56.290 --> 00:02:03.580
 team had failed because already put 

00:02:00.300 --> 00:02:05.200
 applications I have put some 

00:02:03.580 --> 00:02:07.480
 applications as you can see them all 

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:11.080
 these were of the telephone but I am 

00:02:07.480 --> 00:02:13.950
 managed to move the sd card one 

00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:17.890
 draft for me he did put it because 

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:19.960
 there was never too much space on the other 

00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:22.860
 partition sd card 

00:02:19.960 --> 00:02:26.590
 well you don't worry though you can 

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:29.500
 spaziano ends immediately with today 

00:02:26.590 --> 00:02:31.630
 sd link updates will always be 

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:36.040
 more space in this second partition 

00:02:31.630 --> 00:02:39.790
 expiration of boys I hope to 

00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:44.820
 helping you remember if you are there 

00:02:39.790 --> 00:02:49.120
 like this theme is called gold launcher 

00:02:44.820 --> 00:02:51.220
 it's not that it's very fluid anyway 

00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:53.200
 see you guys next time I hope 

00:02:51.220 --> 00:02:55.770
