 54 

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:03.640
 I do not sing anymore 

00:02:04.120 --> 00:02:07.930
 95 54 

00:02:11.100 --> 00:02:13.640
 ah 

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:18.450
 at first the image of god was 

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:20.940
 He created for people to believe in something 

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:23.220
 something that gave meaning to his life something 

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:25.560
 that answered a why is because in 

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:27.780
 my case sees god musically it is to say 

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:30.410
 for me the music is like god but 

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:30.410
 follow the how 

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:36.829
 gives me the sense things believe in the 

00:02:34.189 --> 00:02:39.290
 day by day it is like the symbolic image 

00:02:36.829 --> 00:02:40.849
 that we all see in God is there but not 

00:02:39.290 --> 00:02:43.219
 I can see it is there but I can not 

00:02:40.849 --> 00:02:44.989
 touching it the only thing that binds me to it is the 

00:02:43.219 --> 00:02:47.290
 vibration of the air hitting my ear in 

00:02:44.989 --> 00:02:47.290
 flat 

00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:53.490
 and yet nevertheless something so 

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:55.800
 simple and honeycomb has given me the truth that 

00:02:53.490 --> 00:02:58.320
 I was looking for the answer because I'm here 

00:02:55.800 --> 00:03:00.060
 the next topic is dedicated to all 

00:02:58.320 --> 00:03:04.790
 those who share the same female god 

00:03:00.060 --> 00:03:04.790
 that I music and other 

00:03:06.850 --> 00:03:11.300
 all right 

00:03:08.780 --> 00:03:13.250
 this theme could be the anthem of the 

00:03:11.300 --> 00:03:15.830
 writers and producers who 

00:03:13.250 --> 00:03:17.690
 they sing and of everyone who is dedicated to 

00:03:15.830 --> 00:03:20.900
 work with ideas six towers and Nestor 

00:03:17.690 --> 00:03:23.030

00:03:20.900 --> 00:03:25.010

00:03:23.030 --> 00:03:26.600
 me like pussy is going to value the music that 

00:03:25.010 --> 00:03:27.709
 I do here and if it worries you more it smells 

00:03:26.600 --> 00:03:29.180
 to marijuana hash 

00:03:27.709 --> 00:03:30.950
 finally I wake up at night 

00:03:29.180 --> 00:03:32.750
 often with new ideas I 've 

00:03:30.950 --> 00:03:34.220
 let go see what you try not to 

00:03:32.750 --> 00:03:35.540
 you do not see efforts that I approved of wax 

00:03:34.220 --> 00:03:39.530
 I'm an innocent swimmer 

00:03:35.540 --> 00:03:44.780
 countercurrent but and what if I 

00:03:39.530 --> 00:03:47.020
 I feel good so tell me what the fuck can I 

00:03:44.780 --> 00:03:53.290
 do 

00:03:47.020 --> 00:03:55.850
 dancing alone because if I'm happy 

00:03:53.290 --> 00:03:57.410
 Taking care of my breasts, I take care of him 

00:03:55.850 --> 00:03:59.150

00:03:59.150 --> 00:04:02.300
 when I want to know how the spare goes 

00:04:00.680 --> 00:04:03.950
 which is being dominated by course 

00:04:02.300 --> 00:04:05.990
 They annoy us and break me and michelle me alone 

00:04:03.950 --> 00:04:07.640
 cojones cooks the truths as rich 

00:04:05.990 --> 00:04:09.410

00:04:07.640 --> 00:04:13.630

00:04:09.410 --> 00:04:13.630
