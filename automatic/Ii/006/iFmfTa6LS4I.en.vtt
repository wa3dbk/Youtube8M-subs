00:03:30.070 --> 00:03:33.450 
and I've been like trying to OCD things
but<00:03:31.470> it's<00:03:32.470> not<00:03:32.680> really<00:03:32.860> working<00:03:32.980> out<00:03:33.220> too<00:03:33.430> well

00:03:33.450 --> 00:03:33.460 
but it's not really working out too well

00:03:33.460 --> 00:03:35.990 
but it's not really working out too well
for<00:03:33.640> me<00:03:33.790> at<00:03:33.940> the<00:03:34.030> moment<00:03:34.060> and<00:03:34.450> say<00:03:34.600> in<00:03:34.750> ages

00:03:35.990 --> 00:03:36.000 
for me at the moment and say in ages

yeah I think I'll be coming back to
trading<00:03:39.790> because<00:03:40.920> by<00:03:41.920> looking<00:03:42.220> at<00:03:42.310> the<00:03:42.430> market

00:03:42.810 --> 00:03:42.820 
trading because by looking at the market

00:03:42.820 --> 00:03:45.420 
trading because by looking at the market
it's<00:03:43.060> pretty<00:03:43.660> easy<00:03:43.930> to<00:03:44.200> make<00:03:44.710> money<00:03:44.950> at<00:03:45.370> the

00:03:45.420 --> 00:03:45.430

00:03:45.430 --> 00:03:51.960 
it's pretty easy to make money at the
moment<00:03:45.520> so<00:03:47.580> I<00:03:49.650> will<00:03:50.650> be<00:03:50.680> back<00:03:51.400> in<00:03:51.790> another
