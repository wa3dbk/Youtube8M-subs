00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:38.760 
but throughout the postseason as well

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:41.030 
but throughout the postseason as well
and<00:00:38.969> the<00:00:39.540> question<00:00:39.750> is<00:00:40.110> will<00:00:40.379> they<00:00:40.559> be<00:00:40.620> able<00:00:40.710> to

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:41.040 
and the question is will they be able to

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:42.799 
and the question is will they be able to
carry<00:00:41.280> that<00:00:41.430> over<00:00:41.489> into<00:00:41.760> this<00:00:42.149> series<00:00:42.480> and<00:00:42.719> I'm

00:00:42.799 --> 00:00:42.809 
carry that over into this series and I'm

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:45.020 
carry that over into this series and I'm
not<00:00:42.989> sure<00:00:43.530> that<00:00:43.710> they<00:00:43.829> will<00:00:44.040> because<00:00:44.640> as<00:00:44.820> we

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:45.030 
not sure that they will because as we

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:46.819 
not sure that they will because as we
know<00:00:45.059> good<00:00:45.510> offense<00:00:46.020> always<00:00:46.260> beats<00:00:46.620> good

00:00:46.819 --> 00:00:46.829 
know good offense always beats good

several days of rest so I'm pretty

several days of rest so I'm pretty

confident that Tony Parker will complete

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:10.520

the<00:01:09.030> Spurs<00:01:09.270> offense<00:01:09.479> in<00:01:09.810> this<00:01:09.900> game<00:01:09.990> and<00:01:10.260> an<00:01:10.380> if

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:10.530 
the Spurs offense in this game and an if

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:12.080 
the Spurs offense in this game and an if
that's<00:01:10.710> the<00:01:10.860> case<00:01:11.040> these<00:01:11.610> two<00:01:11.790> teams<00:01:11.970> are

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:12.090 
that's the case these two teams are

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:13.630 
that's the case these two teams are
rolling<00:01:12.420> against<00:01:12.659> one<00:01:12.810> another<00:01:12.840> offensively

00:01:13.630 --> 00:01:13.640 
rolling against one another offensively

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:16.160 
rolling against one another offensively
209<00:01:14.640> points<00:01:14.909> could<00:01:15.180> be<00:01:15.330> a<00:01:15.360> little<00:01:15.600> bit<00:01:15.780> low<00:01:15.960> for

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:16.170 
209 points could be a little bit low for

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:18.530 
209 points could be a little bit low for
these<00:01:16.320> two<00:01:16.530> teams<00:01:16.830> and<00:01:16.979> I<00:01:17.070> think<00:01:17.250> the<00:01:17.340> over<00:01:17.729> has

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:18.540 
these two teams and I think the over has

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:19.969 
these two teams and I think the over has
to<00:01:18.720> have<00:01:18.840> a<00:01:18.869> little<00:01:19.080> bit<00:01:19.200> of<00:01:19.290> value<00:01:19.650> in<00:01:19.830> this

00:01:19.969 --> 00:01:19.979 
to have a little bit of value in this

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:21.469 
to have a little bit of value in this
game<00:01:20.250> one<00:01:20.490> these<00:01:20.700> two<00:01:20.850> teams<00:01:21.060> have<00:01:21.240> missed

00:01:21.469 --> 00:01:21.479 
game one these two teams have missed

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:23.660 
game one these two teams have missed
matches<00:01:21.869> all<00:01:22.229> across<00:01:22.740> the<00:01:22.950> board<00:01:22.979> against<00:01:23.460> one

00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:23.670 
matches all across the board against one

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:25.130 
matches all across the board against one
another<00:01:23.700> and<00:01:24.090> it<00:01:24.210> raises<00:01:24.420> I<00:01:24.720> think<00:01:24.900> it<00:01:24.990> raises

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:25.140 
another and it raises I think it raises

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:26.840 
another and it raises I think it raises
the<00:01:25.380> offense<00:01:25.740> here<00:01:25.920> early<00:01:26.250> in<00:01:26.340> the<00:01:26.430> series<00:01:26.670> and

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:26.850 
the offense here early in the series and

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:29.630

over<00:01:32.970> at<00:01:33.090> nine<00:01:33.390> and<00:01:33.689> three<00:01:34.200> so<00:01:34.500> far<00:01:34.530> this

00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:34.920 
over at nine and three so far this

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:36.830 
over at nine and three so far this
season<00:01:34.979> so<00:01:35.430> the<00:01:35.549> over<00:01:35.880> has<00:01:36.060> been<00:01:36.240> very<00:01:36.509> good<00:01:36.600> at

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:36.840 
season so the over has been very good at

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:38.539 
season so the over has been very good at
cashing<00:01:37.229> in<00:01:37.350> Game<00:01:37.500> ones<00:01:37.799> of<00:01:37.979> this<00:01:38.100> series<00:01:38.310> I

00:01:38.539 --> 00:01:38.549 
cashing in Game ones of this series I

00:01:38.549 --> 00:01:39.980 
cashing in Game ones of this series I
think<00:01:38.909> the<00:01:39.000> over<00:01:39.270> once<00:01:39.509> again<00:01:39.600> we<00:01:39.840> need<00:01:39.869> to

00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:39.990 
think the over once again we need to

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:41.929 
think the over once again we need to
head<00:01:40.829> towards<00:01:41.130> that<00:01:41.280> trend<00:01:41.579> here<00:01:41.759> against

00:01:41.929 --> 00:01:41.939 
head towards that trend here against

00:01:41.939 --> 00:01:44.480 
head towards that trend here against
this<00:01:42.119> total<00:01:42.450> at<00:01:42.540> 209<00:01:43.290> points<00:01:43.560> I<00:01:43.829> think<00:01:44.159> as<00:01:44.340> the

00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:44.490 
this total at 209 points I think as the

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:46.219 
this total at 209 points I think as the
series<00:01:44.700> goes<00:01:44.850> on<00:01:45.210> we'll<00:01:45.420> adjust<00:01:45.720> a<00:01:45.869> little<00:01:45.899> bit

00:01:46.219 --> 00:01:46.229 
series goes on we'll adjust a little bit

00:01:46.229 --> 00:01:47.569 
series goes on we'll adjust a little bit
the<00:01:46.320> defense<00:01:46.680> could<00:01:46.890> become<00:01:47.159> a<00:01:47.189> little<00:01:47.549> bit

00:01:47.569 --> 00:01:47.579 
the defense could become a little bit

00:01:47.579 --> 00:01:50.060 
the defense could become a little bit
more<00:01:47.820> prevalent<00:01:48.420> as<00:01:48.720> we<00:01:49.320> move<00:01:49.500> along<00:01:49.619> deeper

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:50.070 
more prevalent as we move along deeper

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:51.469 
more prevalent as we move along deeper
into<00:01:50.250> the<00:01:50.310> series<00:01:50.490> as<00:01:50.700> we've<00:01:50.850> seen<00:01:51.000> some<00:01:51.240> times

00:01:51.469 --> 00:01:51.479 
into the series as we've seen some times

00:01:51.479 --> 00:01:53.420 
into the series as we've seen some times
throughout<00:01:51.899> these<00:01:52.049> playoffs<00:01:52.259> but<00:01:52.649> early<00:01:53.340> in

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:53.430 
throughout these playoffs but early in

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:54.499 
throughout these playoffs but early in
the<00:01:53.520> series<00:01:53.729> i<00:01:53.880> think<00:01:54.060> these<00:01:54.119> teams<00:01:54.360> will

00:01:54.499 --> 00:01:54.509 
the series i think these teams will

00:01:54.509 --> 00:01:55.819 
the series i think these teams will
start<00:01:54.659> to<00:01:54.810> feel<00:01:54.990> one<00:01:55.170> another<00:01:55.409> out<00:01:55.590> because

00:01:55.819 --> 00:01:55.829 
start to feel one another out because

00:01:55.829 --> 00:01:56.990 
start to feel one another out because
they're<00:01:55.950> a<00:01:55.979> little<00:01:56.219> bit<00:01:56.399> different<00:01:56.729> both<00:01:56.880> a

00:01:56.990 --> 00:01:57.000 
they're a little bit different both a

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:58.010 
they're a little bit different both a
little<00:01:57.210> bit<00:01:57.299> different<00:01:57.630> from<00:01:57.689> when<00:01:57.899> they<00:01:57.990> were

00:01:58.010 --> 00:01:58.020 
little bit different from when they were

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:00.410 
little bit different from when they were
two<00:01:58.290> years<00:01:58.530> ago<00:01:58.680> obviously<00:01:58.950> no<00:01:59.729> James<00:02:00.030> Harden

00:02:00.410 --> 00:02:00.420 
two years ago obviously no James Harden

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:01.789 
two years ago obviously no James Harden
for<00:02:00.570> the<00:02:00.630> Oklahoma<00:02:01.079> City<00:02:01.320> Thunder<00:02:01.439> and<00:02:01.770> I

00:02:01.789 --> 00:02:01.799 
for the Oklahoma City Thunder and I

00:02:01.799 --> 00:02:03.050 
for the Oklahoma City Thunder and I
think<00:02:01.950> the<00:02:02.040> Spurs<00:02:02.280> have<00:02:02.490> gotten<00:02:02.729> a<00:02:02.759> little<00:02:02.880> bit

00:02:03.050 --> 00:02:03.060 
think the Spurs have gotten a little bit

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:05.030 
think the Spurs have gotten a little bit
deeper<00:02:03.390> since<00:02:03.659> then<00:02:03.840> as<00:02:03.960> well<00:02:04.110> so<00:02:04.320> often

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:05.040 
deeper since then as well so often

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:06.859 
deeper since then as well so often
should<00:02:05.280> be<00:02:05.460> even<00:02:06.030> more<00:02:06.210> abundant<00:02:06.719> than<00:02:06.750> I

00:02:06.859 --> 00:02:06.869 
should be even more abundant than I

00:02:06.869 --> 00:02:08.540 
should be even more abundant than I
think<00:02:07.079> it<00:02:07.200> was<00:02:07.380> in<00:02:07.530> that<00:02:07.680> series<00:02:07.979> two<00:02:08.280> years

00:02:08.540 --> 00:02:08.550 
think it was in that series two years

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:10.130 
think it was in that series two years
ago<00:02:08.759> but<00:02:08.910> two<00:02:09.090> of<00:02:09.209> the<00:02:09.300> last<00:02:09.450> three<00:02:09.569> regular

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:10.140 
ago but two of the last three regular

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:11.809 
ago but two of the last three regular
seedings<00:02:10.500> see<00:02:10.979> the<00:02:11.039> Aussies<00:02:11.459> and<00:02:11.610> meetings

00:02:11.809 --> 00:02:11.819 
seedings see the Aussies and meetings

00:02:11.819 --> 00:02:12.170 
seedings see the Aussies and meetings
but

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:12.180 
but

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:14.750 
but
nice<00:02:12.329> to<00:02:12.540> have<00:02:13.019> gone<00:02:13.290> over<00:02:13.709> the<00:02:13.829> total<00:02:14.400> and

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:14.760 
nice to have gone over the total and

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:16.130 
nice to have gone over the total and
even<00:02:15.090> though<00:02:15.180> the<00:02:15.299> thunder<00:02:15.599> of<00:02:15.629> cash<00:02:15.930> the

00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:16.140 
even though the thunder of cash the

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:18.559 
even though the thunder of cash the

cashing me over here this postseason of

00:02:23.189 --> 00:02:25.220 
cashing me over here this postseason of
course<00:02:23.400> the<00:02:23.519> Spurs<00:02:23.760> also<00:02:24.239> cash<00:02:24.689> the<00:02:24.930> under<00:02:25.140> in

00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:26.839 
course the Spurs also cash the under in
their<00:02:25.349> last<00:02:25.530> two<00:02:25.799> but<00:02:26.099> those<00:02:26.519> were<00:02:26.670> both

00:02:26.839 --> 00:02:26.849 
their last two but those were both

00:02:26.849 --> 00:02:28.429 
their last two but those were both
elimination<00:02:27.450> games<00:02:27.659> as<00:02:27.870> we<00:02:27.989> talked<00:02:28.290> about

00:02:28.429 --> 00:02:28.439 
elimination games as we talked about

00:02:28.439 --> 00:02:29.929 
elimination games as we talked about
those<00:02:28.709> games<00:02:28.950> tend<00:02:29.219> to<00:02:29.310> normally<00:02:29.670> hit<00:02:29.819> the

00:02:29.929 --> 00:02:29.939 
those games tend to normally hit the

00:02:29.939 --> 00:02:32.209 
those games tend to normally hit the
under<00:02:30.239> as<00:02:30.389> well<00:02:30.569> but<00:02:30.750> in<00:02:30.989> this<00:02:31.439> postseason<00:02:31.829> San

00:02:32.209 --> 00:02:32.219 
under as well but in this postseason San

00:02:32.219 --> 00:02:34.129 
under as well but in this postseason San
Antonio<00:02:32.579> still<00:02:33.000> eight<00:02:33.269> and<00:02:33.450> four<00:02:33.659> cash<00:02:33.870> in<00:02:34.049> the

Antonio still eight and four cash in the

00:02:34.139 --> 00:02:35.509 
Antonio still eight and four cash in the

their last eight games in the postseason

00:02:37.230 --> 00:02:39.740 
their last eight games in the postseason
I<00:02:37.769> think<00:02:38.010> /<00:02:38.340> 2009<00:02:38.609> is<00:02:38.969> the<00:02:39.120> play<00:02:39.269> here<00:02:39.480> for<00:02:39.510> game

00:02:39.740 --> 00:02:39.750 
I think / 2009 is the play here for game

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:41.270 
I think / 2009 is the play here for game
number<00:02:39.900> one<00:02:40.170> best<00:02:40.680> of<00:02:40.799> luck<00:02:40.889> to<00:02:40.980> you<00:02:41.099> on<00:02:41.219> that

will make sure if there's still time
