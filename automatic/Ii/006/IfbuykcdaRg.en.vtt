cheap but I'm hoping that this will have
more<00:01:05.969> flavor<00:01:06.240> than<00:01:06.450> the<00:01:06.600> cookie<00:01:06.929> dough<00:01:07.079> you

00:01:07.429 --> 00:01:07.439 
more flavor than the cookie dough you

00:01:07.439 --> 00:01:09.649 
more flavor than the cookie dough you
know<00:01:08.009> I<00:01:08.039> was<00:01:08.369> gonna<00:01:08.549> put<00:01:08.819> it<00:01:08.909> on<00:01:08.969> a<00:01:09.060> flight<00:01:09.420> but

00:01:09.649 --> 00:01:09.659 
know I was gonna put it on a flight but

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:11.539 
know I was gonna put it on a flight but
instead<00:01:10.109> I'm<00:01:10.289> just<00:01:10.319> gonna<00:01:10.619> cut<00:01:10.920> it<00:01:10.950> right<00:01:11.100> here

00:01:11.539 --> 00:01:11.549 
instead I'm just gonna cut it right here

00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:13.099 
instead I'm just gonna cut it right here
because<00:01:11.729> I<00:01:12.030> see<00:01:12.270> that<00:01:12.509> there's<00:01:12.719> caramel

00:01:13.099 --> 00:01:13.109 
because I see that there's caramel

00:01:13.109 --> 00:01:18.069 
because I see that there's caramel
that's<00:01:13.439> eased<00:01:15.499> Ashley<00:01:16.499> really<00:01:17.069> liked<00:01:17.520> the

00:01:18.069 --> 00:01:18.079 
that's eased Ashley really liked the

00:01:18.079 --> 00:01:23.449 
that's eased Ashley really liked the
cookie<00:01:19.079> dough<00:01:19.259> one<00:01:20.959> but<00:01:21.959> as<00:01:22.200> you<00:01:22.529> can<00:01:22.679> see<00:01:22.740> the

00:01:23.449 --> 00:01:23.459 
cookie dough one but as you can see the

00:01:23.459 --> 00:01:27.230 
cookie dough one but as you can see the
stuff<00:01:24.450> is<00:01:24.869> just<00:01:25.709> at<00:01:25.979> the<00:01:26.009> very<00:01:26.429> very<00:01:26.819> top

00:01:27.230 --> 00:01:27.240 
stuff is just at the very very top

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:29.120 
stuff is just at the very very top
that's<00:01:27.719> what's<00:01:27.990> kind<00:01:28.200> of<00:01:28.289> disappointing<00:01:29.100> to

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:29.130 
that's what's kind of disappointing to

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:31.969 
that's what's kind of disappointing to
me<00:01:29.359> because<00:01:30.359> I<00:01:30.539> had<00:01:30.810> hoped<00:01:31.109> that<00:01:31.289> it<00:01:31.560> would<00:01:31.770> be

00:01:31.969 --> 00:01:31.979 
me because I had hoped that it would be

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:37.910 
me because I had hoped that it would be
more<00:01:32.609> I<00:01:32.639> guess<00:01:33.270> and<00:01:36.409> maybe<00:01:37.409> this<00:01:37.679> one<00:01:37.889> will

00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:37.920 
more I guess and maybe this one will

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:56.630 
more I guess and maybe this one will
have<00:01:38.310> more<00:01:38.579> flavor

00:01:56.630 --> 00:01:56.640 

00:01:56.640 --> 00:01:59.870 

hmm<00:01:57.710> it<00:01:58.710> does<00:01:58.890> have<00:01:59.130> more<00:01:59.280> flavor<00:01:59.550> than<00:01:59.640> the

00:01:59.870 --> 00:01:59.880 
hmm it does have more flavor than the

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:04.430 
hmm it does have more flavor than the
cookie<00:02:00.180> dough<00:02:01.070> you<00:02:02.690> can<00:02:03.690> really<00:02:04.020> taste<00:02:04.260> the

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:29.790 
the pretzel too so I think though of

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:31.340
