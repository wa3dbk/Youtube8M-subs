00:00:56.189 --> 00:00:56.199

00:00:56.199 --> 00:00:58.229 
well ground and this is the Vitamix a
high<00:00:56.350> speed<00:00:56.649> blender<00:00:56.829> this<00:00:57.519> is<00:00:57.670> my<00:00:57.819> favorite

00:00:58.229 --> 00:00:58.239 
high speed blender this is my favorite

00:00:58.239 --> 00:01:03.119 
high speed blender this is my favorite
blender<00:00:58.769> goes<00:00:59.769> about<00:00:59.949> 250<00:01:00.729> miles<00:01:00.909> an<00:01:01.120> hour<00:01:02.129> so

00:01:03.119 --> 00:01:03.129 
blender goes about 250 miles an hour so

00:01:03.129 --> 00:01:06.120 
blender goes about 250 miles an hour so
it<00:01:03.280> really<00:01:03.540> pulverizes<00:01:04.540> your<00:01:04.930> food<00:01:05.199> well<00:01:05.650> so

00:01:06.120 --> 00:01:06.130 
it really pulverizes your food well so

00:01:06.130 --> 00:01:09.289 
it really pulverizes your food well so
it's<00:01:06.280> broken<00:01:06.520> down<00:01:06.760> to<00:01:06.940> the<00:01:06.970> cellular<00:01:07.270> level

00:01:09.289 --> 00:01:09.299 
it's broken down to the cellular level

00:01:09.299 --> 00:01:11.580 
it's broken down to the cellular level
therefore<00:01:10.299> your<00:01:10.600> body<00:01:10.630> can<00:01:11.049> digest<00:01:11.200> the

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:11.590 
therefore your body can digest the

00:01:11.590 --> 00:01:13.380 
therefore your body can digest the
Greens<00:01:11.829> really<00:01:12.159> well<00:01:12.340> so<00:01:12.909> I'm<00:01:12.969> going<00:01:13.119> to<00:01:13.180> start

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:13.200 
the core leave the core of the pineapple

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:17.270 
the core leave the core of the pineapple
a<00:02:13.830> lot<00:02:14.610> of<00:02:14.700> people<00:02:14.940> remove<00:02:15.269> the<00:02:15.450> core<00:02:16.040> the<00:02:17.040> core

a lot of people remove the core the core
of<00:02:17.430> the<00:02:17.549> pineapple<00:02:17.730> seems<00:02:18.420> tough<00:02:18.690> but<00:02:19.019> it

00:02:19.130 --> 00:02:19.140 
of the pineapple seems tough but it

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:21.380 
of the pineapple seems tough but it
breaks<00:02:19.950> down<00:02:20.250> really<00:02:20.519> well<00:02:20.880> in<00:02:21.120> the<00:02:21.209> food

00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:21.390 
breaks down really well in the food

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:25.100 
breaks down really well in the food
processor<00:02:22.190> and<00:02:23.190> the<00:02:23.489> core<00:02:24.480> has<00:02:24.690> the<00:02:24.810> bromelain

00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:25.110 
processor and the core has the bromelain

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:27.380 
processor and the core has the bromelain
in<00:02:25.530> it<00:02:25.769> which<00:02:26.010> is<00:02:26.040> the<00:02:26.250> enzyme<00:02:26.610> to<00:02:27.000> help<00:02:27.150> digest

00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:27.390 
in it which is the enzyme to help digest

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:30.560 
in it which is the enzyme to help digest
protein<00:02:28.290> that's<00:02:28.980> a<00:02:29.040> really<00:02:29.250> good<00:02:29.420> benefit<00:02:30.420> of

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:30.570 
protein that's a really good benefit of

00:02:30.570 --> 00:02:33.620 
protein that's a really good benefit of
leaving<00:02:30.900> the<00:02:32.239> core<00:02:33.239> of<00:02:33.359> the<00:02:33.480> pineapple

00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:33.630 
leaving the core of the pineapple

00:02:33.630 --> 00:02:35.120 
leaving the core of the pineapple
because<00:02:34.140> you<00:02:34.230> get<00:02:34.350> that<00:02:34.530> benefit<00:02:34.920> with<00:02:35.070> the

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:35.130 
because you get that benefit with the

00:02:35.130 --> 00:02:42.890 
because you get that benefit with the
bromelain<00:02:36.500> okay<00:02:37.500> let's<00:02:38.070> throw<00:02:38.310> that<00:02:38.370> in<00:02:38.670> a<00:02:41.900> lot

00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:42.900 
bromelain okay let's throw that in a lot

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:44.890 
bromelain okay let's throw that in a lot
of<00:02:43.019> people<00:02:43.290> buy<00:02:43.440> the<00:02:43.549> pineapple<00:02:44.549> already

00:02:44.890 --> 00:02:44.900 
of people buy the pineapple already

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:49.610 
of people buy the pineapple already
sliced<00:02:45.900> and<00:02:46.470> canned<00:02:47.299> that<00:02:48.299> pineapple<00:02:48.660> isn't

00:02:49.610 --> 00:02:49.620 
sliced and canned that pineapple isn't

00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:51.349 
sliced and canned that pineapple isn't
loaded<00:02:49.980> with<00:02:50.100> the<00:02:50.220> nutrients<00:02:50.700> that<00:02:51.000> this<00:02:51.180> is

00:02:51.349 --> 00:02:51.359 
loaded with the nutrients that this is

00:02:51.359 --> 00:02:54.620 
loaded with the nutrients that this is
because<00:02:51.690> it's<00:02:51.870> been<00:02:52.019> pasteurized<00:02:52.560> so<00:02:53.630> that's

00:02:54.620 --> 00:02:54.630 
because it's been pasteurized so that's

00:02:54.630 --> 00:02:57.400 
because it's been pasteurized so that's
why<00:02:54.780> it's<00:02:54.900> good<00:02:55.049> to<00:02:55.079> use<00:02:55.290> fresh<00:02:55.560> pineapple<00:02:56.299> and

00:02:57.400 --> 00:02:57.410 
why it's good to use fresh pineapple and
