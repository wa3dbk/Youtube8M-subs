00:00:04.819 --> 00:00:09.090
 wood is one of the first finishing 

00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:11.460
 materials that began to be applied 

00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:13.380
 a man in the improvement of their homes 

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:15.210
 the main advantages of wood 

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:17.910
 ecological simplicity of processing 

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:20.160
 beautiful appearance thanks to these 

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:22.470
 properties people used wood on 

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:24.090
 over many millennia but like u 

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:26.609
 any natural material 

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:28.340
 wood has its drawbacks low 

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:31.109
 fire resistance 

00:00:28.340 --> 00:00:32.730
 fragility high price thanks 

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:35.280
 technology development in construction 

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:37.290
 industries began to appear artificial 

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:39.570
 PVC finishing materials 

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:42.059
 their merits are moisture resistance in 

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:42.480
 durability easy to install low 

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:45.030
 price 

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:47.489
 but pvc materials have their drawbacks 

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:49.950
 brittleness low fire resistance 

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:51.989
 lack of aesthetics characteristic 

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:55.469
 natural material but it's all in 

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:57.720
 past in 2012 the company dpk 

00:00:55.469 --> 00:00:59.630
 launched production absolutely 

00:00:57.720 --> 00:01:02.220
 two types of finishing materials 

00:00:59.630 --> 00:01:03.660
 wood-polymer composite material 

00:01:02.220 --> 00:01:10.140
 combined in itself all the positive 

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:10.770
 properties of wood and polymer company 

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:12.780
 tpk 

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:15.270
 use modern technological 

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:17.730
 equipment for the production of products from 

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:19.830
 wood-polymer composite on the ground 

00:01:17.730 --> 00:01:21.120
 stage natural wood mixed 

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:23.580
 with polymeric resins 

00:01:21.120 --> 00:01:25.830
 then dyes are added thanks 

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:28.140
 what we get a wide range of colors 

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:29.990
 we also use special additives 

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:32.520
 to increase the fire resistance 

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:35.220
 resistance to UV and decay 

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:37.350
 after connecting these components to 

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:40.040
 the output is a ready mix for 

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:43.020
 subsequent granulation and extrusion 

00:01:40.040 --> 00:01:45.000
 at each stage of production 

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:46.640
 undergo a thorough quality control 

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:49.200
 which increases efficiency 

00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:51.030
 technological chain to give 

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:53.400
 natural appearance products 

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:54.900
 wood texture is applied 

00:01:53.400 --> 00:01:56.820
 without the use of films 

00:01:54.900 --> 00:01:59.580
 thanks to its unique properties 

00:01:56.820 --> 00:02:01.980
 our products find their use in 

00:01:59.580 --> 00:02:04.260
 interior design in exterior cladding 

00:02:01.980 --> 00:02:06.420
 buildings in the manufacture of outdoor furniture and 

00:02:04.260 --> 00:02:09.020
 terraces in the decoration of reservoirs and 

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:09.020
 landscape design 

00:02:11.460 --> 00:02:13.460
 but 

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:19.840
 today the company ltd tpk 

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:22.540
 lets out three types of a profile of products 

00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:24.580
 lining the terrace board and block house 

00:02:22.540 --> 00:02:27.130
 profile row is constantly updated 

00:02:24.580 --> 00:02:31.620
