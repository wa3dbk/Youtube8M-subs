00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:36.360 
put it on a coin you turn this pulls it

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:38.630 
put it on a coin you turn this pulls it
pulls<00:01:36.990> it<00:01:37.110> down<00:01:37.140> a<00:01:37.290> ramp<00:01:37.590> into<00:01:37.950> the<00:01:38.220> coin<00:01:38.400> tray

pulls it down a ramp into the coin tray

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:43.160 
pulls it down a ramp into the coin tray
it<00:01:39.479> can<00:01:39.630> also<00:01:39.750> do<00:01:40.939> more<00:01:41.939> than<00:01:42.270> one<00:01:42.780> it<00:01:42.930> can<00:01:43.049> do

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:48.210 
is the max but sometimes it works for

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:53.870 
is the max but sometimes it works for
three<00:01:49.009> so<00:01:50.930> yeah<00:01:51.930> and<00:01:52.110> they<00:01:52.229> went<00:01:52.439> in<00:01:52.560> there<00:01:52.880> and
