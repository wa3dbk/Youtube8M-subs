because<00:00:12.879> not<00:00:13.330> only<00:00:13.360> will<00:00:13.629> incline<00:00:13.869> water<00:00:14.199> ice

00:00:14.430 --> 00:00:14.440 
because not only will incline water ice

00:00:14.440 --> 00:00:16.260 
because not only will incline water ice
incredibly<00:00:15.129> well<00:00:15.309> but<00:00:15.969> it's<00:00:16.090> a<00:00:16.119> good

for<00:00:49.420> mountaineering<00:00:49.809> application<00:00:50.469> I<00:00:50.590> think

00:00:50.849 --> 00:00:50.859 
for mountaineering application I think

00:00:50.859 --> 00:00:53.639 
for mountaineering application I think
this<00:00:51.100> is<00:00:51.730> the<00:00:51.910> best<00:00:52.090> option<00:00:52.300> to<00:00:52.539> go<00:00:52.690> with<00:00:52.719> this

00:00:53.639 --> 00:00:53.649 
this is the best option to go with this

00:00:53.649 --> 00:00:55.439 
this is the best option to go with this
trigger<00:00:53.920> you<00:00:54.160> can<00:00:54.309> either<00:00:54.460> fully<00:00:54.699> remove<00:00:55.090> or

00:00:55.439 --> 00:00:55.449 
trigger you can either fully remove or

00:00:55.449 --> 00:00:57.419 
trigger you can either fully remove or
change<00:00:55.719> Heights<00:00:56.410> depend<00:00:56.920> on<00:00:56.980> where<00:00:57.160> you<00:00:57.190> want

00:00:57.419 --> 00:00:57.429 
change Heights depend on where you want

00:00:57.429 --> 00:01:00.779

to put it for your hand on the tool the

00:01:00.789 --> 00:01:03.689 
to put it for your hand on the tool the
head<00:01:01.000> is<00:01:01.719> very<00:01:02.050> unique<00:01:02.440> in<00:01:03.100> the<00:01:03.219> fact<00:01:03.370> that<00:01:03.579> you

00:01:03.689 --> 00:01:03.699 
head is very unique in the fact that you

00:01:03.699 --> 00:01:08.220 
head is very unique in the fact that you
can<00:01:03.879> take<00:01:04.449> off<00:01:04.690> the<00:01:05.019> hammer<00:01:06.750> this<00:01:07.750> is<00:01:07.810> the<00:01:08.050> adds

another<00:01:13.960> screw<00:01:14.320> that<00:01:14.470> screws<00:01:14.710> right<00:01:14.920> into<00:01:15.040> the

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:15.160 
another screw that screws right into the

00:01:15.160 --> 00:01:17.160 
another screw that screws right into the
back<00:01:15.310> of<00:01:15.340> this<00:01:15.580> you<00:01:15.670> can<00:01:15.790> have<00:01:15.910> one<00:01:16.120> tool<00:01:16.360> out

00:01:17.160 --> 00:01:17.170 
back of this you can have one tool out

00:01:17.170 --> 00:01:18.840 
back of this you can have one tool out
using<00:01:17.590> as<00:01:17.860> a<00:01:17.890> normal<00:01:18.340> like<00:01:18.430> mountaineering

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:18.850 
using as a normal like mountaineering

00:01:18.850 --> 00:01:21.810 
using as a normal like mountaineering
style<00:01:19.150> axe<00:01:19.390> because<00:01:19.630> it's<00:01:19.990> so<00:01:20.140> straight<00:01:20.820> it'll

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:21.820 
style axe because it's so straight it'll

00:01:21.820 --> 00:01:24.780 
style axe because it's so straight it'll
plunge<00:01:22.140> very<00:01:23.140> very<00:01:23.380> easily<00:01:23.590> you<00:01:24.250> can<00:01:24.370> dagger

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:24.790 
plunge very very easily you can dagger

00:01:24.790 --> 00:01:26.730 
plunge very very easily you can dagger
very<00:01:25.000> easily<00:01:25.240> with<00:01:25.510> it<00:01:25.690> and<00:01:26.230> if<00:01:26.320> you<00:01:26.410> look<00:01:26.620> at

00:01:26.730 --> 00:01:26.740 
very easily with it and if you look at

00:01:26.740 --> 00:01:28.470 
very easily with it and if you look at
how<00:01:26.890> much<00:01:27.430> this<00:01:27.580> is<00:01:27.730> curved<00:01:28.000> -<00:01:28.150> another<00:01:28.300> nice

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:28.480 
how much this is curved - another nice

00:01:28.480 --> 00:01:30.690 
how much this is curved - another nice
tool<00:01:28.810> it<00:01:29.320> really<00:01:29.500> leans<00:01:29.770> a<00:01:29.890> long<00:01:30.100> way<00:01:30.280> back<00:01:30.520> so

00:01:30.690 --> 00:01:30.700 
tool it really leans a long way back so

00:01:30.700 --> 00:01:32.790 
tool it really leans a long way back so
it<00:01:30.790> climbs<00:01:31.030> ice<00:01:31.240> very<00:01:31.960> very<00:01:32.290> well<00:01:32.530> it's<00:01:32.650> got<00:01:32.770> a

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:32.800 
it climbs ice very very well it's got a

00:01:32.800 --> 00:01:36.000 
it climbs ice very very well it's got a
lot<00:01:33.040> of<00:01:33.070> bulge<00:01:33.460> clearing<00:01:33.850> ability<00:01:34.240> to<00:01:34.390> it<00:01:35.010> be

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:36.010 
lot of bulge clearing ability to it be

00:01:36.010 --> 00:01:42.450 
lot of bulge clearing ability to it be
rated<00:01:36.370> pick<00:01:39.060> the<00:01:40.060> head<00:01:40.270> has<00:01:41.200> these<00:01:42.100> take<00:01:42.340> it

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:42.460 
rated pick the head has these take it

00:01:42.460 --> 00:01:45.360 
rated pick the head has these take it
out<00:01:42.580> for<00:01:42.910> weight<00:01:43.540> savings<00:01:43.990> obviously<00:01:44.440> but<00:01:45.190> it

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:45.370 
out for weight savings obviously but it

00:01:45.370 --> 00:01:46.770 
out for weight savings obviously but it
is<00:01:45.460> they<00:01:45.640> did<00:01:45.850> this<00:01:45.910> in<00:01:46.030> the<00:01:46.090> same<00:01:46.270> shape<00:01:46.510> as<00:01:46.690> an
