00:00:01.010 --> 00:00:10.320

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:18.810
 I also find her house 

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:23.180
 chicken legs and there time 

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:23.180

00:00:27.949 --> 00:00:30.949
 search 

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:18.729
 ingo have been around 4 door for three years 

00:01:17.950 --> 00:01:20.500
 disappeared 

00:01:18.729 --> 00:01:23.200
 the brothers have the big distance 

00:01:20.500 --> 00:01:24.100
 World opened up for hero adventures 

00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:26.649
 to experience 

00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:28.840
 since that time they are from theirs 

00:01:26.649 --> 00:01:31.899
 Mother sought the wise and hardworking 

00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:33.580
 she was reader on their journey they come 

00:01:31.899 --> 00:01:36.759
 in the magic forest of the evil witch baba 

00:01:33.580 --> 00:01:39.399
 jaga what the mother does not suspect both 

00:01:36.759 --> 00:01:40.270
 children are already very close they can 

00:01:39.399 --> 00:01:43.000
 just do not see them 

00:01:40.270 --> 00:01:46.259
 at the arriaga and your door in maple 

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:46.259
 has transformed trees 

00:01:47.110 --> 00:01:51.050
 welcome to a new one 

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:53.270
 Issue of lamp fever 

00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:54.950
 Today we introduce the new one 

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:57.080
 Christmas staging of the Gerhart 

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:59.120
 Captain Theaters Enchanted 

00:01:57.080 --> 00:02:01.510
 brothers in front of and next to me is the 

00:01:59.120 --> 00:02:02.660
 Director of the piece Mr. Peter Kube 

00:02:01.510 --> 00:02:05.000
 hemisphere 

00:02:02.660 --> 00:02:07.490
 they are already infecting them 

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:09.590
 for the second time here in zittau what is 

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:10.520
 because the special thing about a fairy tale 

00:02:09.590 --> 00:02:12.770
 to bring the stage 

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:14.540
 the special about a fairy tale on the 

00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:16.400
 To bring a stage is that you know that 

00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:18.530
 it is a family production 

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:20.420
 So one piece has to be that 

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:23.030
 for the whole family a nice 

00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:25.250
 theater art keeps it that way 

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:26.870
 motivates the grandma grandpa and above all 

00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:28.580
 of course the children are doing well 

00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:31.370
 entertained and a nice theater 

00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:33.320
 evening experience how much time and work 

00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:35.380
 is behind such a big one 

00:02:33.320 --> 00:02:39.110
 Fairy tale piece one can already say 

00:02:35.380 --> 00:02:41.840
 yes time is very much behind it 

00:02:39.110 --> 00:02:43.220
 fantasy is many ideas but time factor 

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:45.650
 of course a big question today 

00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:46.760
 because the production time of course 

00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:47.950
 you had to be cut earlier 

00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:49.940
 maybe a little more time 

00:02:47.950 --> 00:02:52.040
 Overall, you can say that you are 

00:02:49.940 --> 00:02:55.000
 with such a production more or 

00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:59.239
 less than two months at least 

00:02:55.000 --> 00:03:02.090
 busy from the beginning to the end 

00:02:59.239 --> 00:03:03.500
 it is a Russian fairytale what is 

00:03:02.090 --> 00:03:04.310
 because for you the special dream 

00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:06.560
 maybe they can do something 

00:03:04.310 --> 00:03:07.730
 trading line stocks to trade electricity 

00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:09.890
 I do not want to talk so much though 

00:03:07.730 --> 00:03:13.190
 the russian fairy tale that's me 

00:03:09.890 --> 00:03:15.230
 who was born a long time ago 

00:03:13.190 --> 00:03:16.910
 I grew up with the 

00:03:15.230 --> 00:03:17.690
 Russian fairy tale and the Russian 

00:03:16.910 --> 00:03:19.459
 Fairy tales always had one 

00:03:17.690 --> 00:03:21.320
 unlikely joke and above all 

00:03:19.459 --> 00:03:22.730
 Things always got against the authorities 

00:03:21.320 --> 00:03:25.159
 insane 

00:03:22.730 --> 00:03:27.319
 but ran with joke and 

00:03:25.159 --> 00:03:29.629
 I really liked that 

00:03:27.319 --> 00:03:31.790
 and the bad ones that was great all these 

00:03:29.629 --> 00:03:33.799
 the bad people were evil 

00:03:31.790 --> 00:03:34.909
 but they were weirdly angry 

00:03:33.799 --> 00:03:38.090
 man could laugh about that 

00:03:34.909 --> 00:03:39.650
 you could sympathize with him and you 

00:03:38.090 --> 00:03:41.660
 were always very human and the 

00:03:39.650 --> 00:03:44.090
 witches usually yes with men actually 

00:03:41.660 --> 00:03:44.900
 basically whether the witches were with 

00:03:44.090 --> 00:03:47.030
 men occupied 

00:03:44.900 --> 00:03:49.670
 that was not a bad occupation as 

00:03:47.030 --> 00:03:51.620
 very funny and with a lot of fun 

00:03:49.670 --> 00:03:55.129
 and they had stood at the 

00:03:51.620 --> 00:03:58.849
 enchanted brothers only so much the witch 

00:03:55.129 --> 00:04:01.879
 baba jaga as it is called in the original witch 

00:03:58.849 --> 00:04:04.489
 baba jaga has the sons fjords and igor 

00:04:01.879 --> 00:04:06.530
 from wassilissa the working name around trees 

00:04:04.489 --> 00:04:08.150
 transformed and I am now in the forest 

00:04:06.530 --> 00:04:09.739
 So the two brothers were the forest 

00:04:08.150 --> 00:04:11.989
 Gone were tasks from her mom 

00:04:09.739 --> 00:04:13.579
 did not come back and had 

00:04:11.989 --> 00:04:15.170
 himself a little overestimated because 

00:04:13.579 --> 00:04:17.120
 They believed now because of unity 

00:04:15.170 --> 00:04:18.889
 bull on the horns packed and to 

00:04:17.120 --> 00:04:20.570
 side posed among others as me 

00:04:18.889 --> 00:04:22.460
 never felt what was done before 

00:04:20.570 --> 00:04:23.960
 as heroes overestimated each other 

00:04:22.460 --> 00:04:25.850
 and by the overconfidence 

00:04:23.960 --> 00:04:26.930
 So forest without big fuses 

00:04:25.850 --> 00:04:29.060
 gone to the witch baba jaga 

00:04:26.930 --> 00:04:30.979
 bumped and are from their trees 

00:04:29.060 --> 00:04:32.870
 been transformed because that made that 

00:04:30.979 --> 00:04:36.080
 fun and that's fun 

00:04:32.870 --> 00:04:38.900
 Now the wassilissa has started 

00:04:36.080 --> 00:04:41.750
 has to look for her sons igor her 

00:04:38.900 --> 00:04:43.970
 entrusted the house to third son so 

00:04:41.750 --> 00:04:46.520
 first house and now it is 

00:04:43.970 --> 00:04:47.060
 three years on the way the sons 

00:04:46.520 --> 00:04:48.979
 search 

00:04:47.060 --> 00:04:50.120
 in the meantime , figur home has 

00:04:48.979 --> 00:04:52.340
 no longer is keep 

00:04:50.120 --> 00:04:54.860
 started running now in mum and looking in 

00:04:52.340 --> 00:04:57.360
 they meet the forest of the witch baba jaga 

00:04:54.860 --> 00:04:59.460
 be very wondrous now 

00:04:57.360 --> 00:05:03.479
 So again, and now try the 

00:04:59.460 --> 00:05:06.000
 Both sons Rudolf Joder closed again 

00:05:03.479 --> 00:05:07.620
 liberate it so an exciting 

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:09.270
 story for boys 1 

00:05:07.620 --> 00:05:10.469
 that's a really exciting story 

00:05:09.270 --> 00:05:12.870
 it's about big things suite around 

00:05:10.469 --> 00:05:15.000
 friendship it's about love it's about 

00:05:12.870 --> 00:05:15.659
 It helps to pack it 

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:17.310
 can 

00:05:15.659 --> 00:05:19.469
 How do you find friends? 

00:05:17.310 --> 00:05:21.300
 and someone, so to speak, an extra 

00:05:19.469 --> 00:05:23.340
 evil witch can beat a fool 

00:05:21.300 --> 00:05:25.680
 how to do that is great 

00:05:23.340 --> 00:05:26.490
 amounts to that there it goes itself 

00:05:25.680 --> 00:05:27.960
 have here in dresden am 

00:05:26.490 --> 00:05:31.139
 state act a few years ago 

00:05:27.960 --> 00:05:32.909
 even the witch baba jaga has played 

00:05:31.139 --> 00:05:35.610
 the figure in the years of the 

00:05:32.909 --> 00:05:36.750
 time somehow changed that war 

00:05:35.610 --> 00:05:40.650
 not to worry about that now 

00:05:36.750 --> 00:05:42.449
 The figure has changed so that's it 

00:05:40.650 --> 00:05:43.409
 which was fun for me then 

00:05:42.449 --> 00:05:45.029
 I 'm so slow now too 

00:05:43.409 --> 00:05:46.860
 reminds us what we were back then 

00:05:45.029 --> 00:05:48.389
 or how it used to be 

00:05:46.860 --> 00:05:52.620
 it had felt like it had played 

00:05:48.389 --> 00:05:54.509
 It was great fun and this one 

00:05:52.620 --> 00:05:56.189
 roll baba jaga back then in dresden 

00:05:54.509 --> 00:05:58.620
 I still remember that today 

00:05:56.189 --> 00:06:00.419
 I had the biggest feedback I ever had 

00:05:58.620 --> 00:06:02.639
 during my acting career at the 

00:06:00.419 --> 00:06:04.409
 stands trister theater still had today 

00:06:02.639 --> 00:06:06.650
 people arrive and tell me about them 

00:06:04.409 --> 00:06:09.419
 at that time I have a witch baba jaga 

00:06:06.650 --> 00:06:11.330
 seen there I was still like that and you notice 

00:06:09.419 --> 00:06:13.800
 also how to get older is bad 

00:06:11.330 --> 00:06:16.589
 Anyway, this witch baba jaga is one 

00:06:13.800 --> 00:06:18.990
 big identification figure in not even 

00:06:16.589 --> 00:06:20.520
 negative senses but because we have that 

00:06:18.990 --> 00:06:22.379
 even then tried the witch was 

00:06:20.520 --> 00:06:24.539
 not to be angry at all 

00:06:22.379 --> 00:06:26.460
 but that's just the same as it is 

00:06:24.539 --> 00:06:29.789
 the task is your role the witch 

00:06:26.460 --> 00:06:31.349
 to be and try to do that 

00:06:29.789 --> 00:06:32.550
 was great fun 

00:06:31.349 --> 00:06:34.770
 We tried again today 

00:06:32.550 --> 00:06:37.469
 Of course, today also tries on that 

00:06:34.770 --> 00:06:39.089
 that will be a very dazzling figure and 

00:06:37.469 --> 00:06:40.560
 that's not the evil in itself with 

00:06:39.089 --> 00:06:42.719
 other characters around walked with 

00:06:40.560 --> 00:06:44.610
 great pleasure and liszt still try 

00:06:42.719 --> 00:06:45.529
 to be more important than Saxon oneself 

00:06:44.610 --> 00:06:47.269
 important is 

00:06:45.529 --> 00:06:48.529
 that sounds very much in any case 

00:06:47.269 --> 00:06:49.039
 great thanks for that 

00:06:48.529 --> 00:06:50.959
 conversation 

00:06:49.039 --> 00:06:54.829
 Incidentally, the brothers' driving times are celebrated 

00:06:50.959 --> 00:06:57.559
 premiere on 24 november here at the theater 

00:06:54.829 --> 00:06:59.389
 further information to the piece and to 

00:06:57.559 --> 00:07:06.099

00:07:36.350 --> 00:07:50.780
 the brain and do not turn the criticism
