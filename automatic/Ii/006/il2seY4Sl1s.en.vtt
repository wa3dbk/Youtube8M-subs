00:03:27.190 --> 00:03:27.200 
number three slide of insanity this is

00:03:27.200 --> 00:03:29.350 
number three slide of insanity this is
the<00:03:27.349> post<00:03:28.069> radio<00:03:28.489> tower<00:03:28.730> this<00:03:28.940> is<00:03:29.000> the<00:03:29.180> moment

00:03:29.350 --> 00:03:29.360 
the post radio tower this is the moment

00:03:29.360 --> 00:03:31.240 
the post radio tower this is the moment
where<00:03:29.660> claim<00:03:29.900> is<00:03:30.050> actually<00:03:30.440> crashing<00:03:31.040> and

00:03:31.240 --> 00:03:31.250 
where claim is actually crashing and

00:03:31.250 --> 00:03:33.220 
where claim is actually crashing and
Lara<00:03:31.760> does<00:03:32.030> everything<00:03:32.390> to<00:03:32.750> survive<00:03:33.050> that

00:03:33.220 --> 00:03:33.230 
Lara does everything to survive that

00:03:33.230 --> 00:03:36.250 
Lara does everything to survive that
crash<00:03:33.440> and<00:03:33.830> it's<00:03:34.280> also<00:03:34.670> an<00:03:35.360> analogy<00:03:35.870> of<00:03:36.050> the

00:03:36.250 --> 00:03:36.260 
crash and it's also an analogy of the

00:03:36.260 --> 00:03:42.840 
crash and it's also an analogy of the
loss

00:03:42.840 --> 00:03:42.850

number<00:03:43.850> two<00:03:44.090> the<00:03:44.360> scavenger<00:03:44.930> hub<00:03:45.140> this<00:03:45.650> is<00:03:45.770> one

00:03:45.880 --> 00:03:45.890 
number two the scavenger hub this is one

00:03:45.890 --> 00:03:47.410 
number two the scavenger hub this is one
of<00:03:45.980> the<00:03:46.070> example<00:03:46.790> of<00:03:46.880> the<00:03:47.030> hubs<00:03:47.210> that<00:03:47.300> we

00:03:47.410 --> 00:03:47.420 
of the example of the hubs that we

00:03:47.420 --> 00:03:49.270 
of the example of the hubs that we
created<00:03:47.810> for<00:03:47.990> the<00:03:48.050> game<00:03:48.260> where<00:03:48.980> the<00:03:49.130> player

00:03:49.270 --> 00:03:49.280 
created for the game where the player

00:03:49.280 --> 00:03:52.420 
created for the game where the player
can<00:03:49.310> actually<00:03:49.910> explore<00:03:50.860> much<00:03:51.860> more<00:03:52.160> because

00:03:52.420 --> 00:03:52.430 
can actually explore much more because

00:03:52.430 --> 00:03:54.910 
can actually explore much more because
it's<00:03:52.550> a<00:03:52.640> much<00:03:52.850> open<00:03:53.360> space<00:03:53.390> and<00:03:53.990> one<00:03:54.830> other

00:03:54.910 --> 00:03:54.920 
it's a much open space and one other

00:03:54.920 --> 00:03:56.410 
it's a much open space and one other
thing<00:03:55.100> interesting<00:03:55.550> about<00:03:55.640> that<00:03:55.820> hub<00:03:56.120> is<00:03:56.270> that

00:03:56.410 --> 00:03:56.420 
thing interesting about that hub is that

00:03:56.420 --> 00:03:58.210 
thing interesting about that hub is that
we<00:03:56.540> place<00:03:56.870> a<00:03:56.900> lot<00:03:57.140> of<00:03:57.230> combat<00:03:57.590> setups<00:03:57.920> in<00:03:58.040> there
